<h3>孫院長綜合新建議　各方熱望共黨接受　雷震離滬携返補充意見</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十五日電〕孫科對時局所提新意見，經主席同意後，關人馬司兩使均表滿意，認爲「很好，只盼共黨能來，就可以解決問題了」。政府方面現亦以極大之熱望，期待共黨能懸崖勒馬。昨晚赴滬之政協秘書長雷震，十六日晨可返京，有無開展，屆時當可揭曉，馬司兩氏十五日上下午，兩度會晤，聞對新意見研討甚久，政府雖未將此項意見用書面送達美方及共產黨與民盟，但十四日下午傅涇波謁主席時，已獲悉詳情，並已轉致馬司。民盟梁漱溟十五日下午五時訪傳涇波及大使，曾彼此交換意見。傅涇波三時曾訪王外長晤談片刻後返使館，共產黨代表團本日亦無任何活動，孫科則於今日立法院例會對商談近况會有所報吿。</p>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕政協會秘書長雷震氏，昨晨八時由京抵滬，記者特趨訪於旅邸，叩詢來滬任務，雷氏稱：孫哲生氏自滬返京後，曾綜合上海第三而對於和平大局之意見，向政府提具新建議，本人此次來滬，係就此建議，再與第三方面人士交換意見，雷氏幷說明政府對和平始終抱有最大熱忱，祇要中共能參加和平商談，則大局必可順利解決，至於張家口之軍事行動，完全係出於被迫，對和平大局幷無影響，記者詢以孫氏新建議之內容如何，雷氏稱：現尙未至發表之時，記者復詢以政府對孫氏提出之新建議，有無意見，雷氏稱：主席對孫氏携回之新建議，並無表示，惟據個人觀察，倘周恩來先生能在最近期內返京商談，則問題自易解決。又據記者探悉；雷氏抵滬後，昨日上午曾分別在海格路範園及地體路地豐里八號與民盟及靑年黨分別有所會談，內容不詳，據某政洽觀察家之意見，政府希望和平之意，仍甚堅決，如中共亦以和平爲念，時局在最近期間，或有好轉可能，但目前軍車未停，變化的可能性仍甚大，故各方面爲和平奔走之人士，必須爭取時間。</p>
<p>又政協代表莫德惠氏，於前晚夜車來滬，據聞亦與和談有關。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕雷震·莫德惠兩氏，來滬公畢，已於昨晚夜車返京。</p>
<p>中間人士之建議　雷氏將轉達政府</p>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕昨日下午民盟張君勱。黃炎培等，曾赴巾共辦事處訪晤周恩來，商討和平大局，聞中共方面並無表示，下午六時，靑年黨·民盟·社會賢達三方面留滬代表左舜生·陳啓天·李璜·張君　·黃炎培·羅隆基·章伯鈞·胡政之等，會假節圖會談，政協秘書長雷振氏亦在座，首由民盟方面報告與中共周恩來晤而情形，並補充對和平大局之意見，至八時許始散。</p>
<p>據雷秘書長語記者，渠返京後，即將各方面提出之補充意見，與孫院長接洽後，再向政府轉達，以便有所建議，最後雷氏對大局表示樂觀。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社南京十五日電〕政治協商會議政府各代表本日晨聞表示，希望馬歇爾特使與司徒雷登大使支持彼等之努力，以解決現行危機，而確保立法院長孫科所擬和平方案之成功。</p>
<h3>周恩來如返京商談　停戰協定可立致　孫科對美記者發表談話</h3>
<p>〔合衆社南京十五日電〕立法院院長孫科今日單獨接見合衆社記者稱：「共產黨如聰明，則應接受政府之新辦法」。渠指出共產黨已失却軍略上有利之點，目下第三方面領袖（包括共產黨在內）所可爲者，即前來南京參加三人與五人委員會以及政協綜合小組及憲草審査小組猶如政府所同意者。孫氏云：「目下尙有討論並擬就滿意協定之時間。常前最迫切之問題，厥爲停止衝突。此一問題一旦解決，則其他一切問題亦將自動獲得解決矣」。渠相信如周恩來返京參加三人委員會，則停戰協定可以獲致。孫氏繼稱：「以後最重要之問題則爲憲草」，並謂：如第三方面領袖參加政協憲草審査小組並完成技術上之各項細則，則政府在國民大會中將同意現行政協憲草爲正式草案。</p>
<h3>預料第三方面　將有良好反映</h3>
<p>渠預料上海第三方面對政府所提辦法將有良好反映，因此項辦法實際上即係根據彼等之建議，渠說明政府新辦法與第三方面建議之唯一不同之電，即第三方面希望立即發生停戰命令，而政府則須待共產黨同意停止作戰及周恩來願意來京參加三人委員會以求成立協定後始能出此。常詢以政府是否準備再作讓步時，渠云：「如少數黨一旦返京參加談判，則政府至少願意採取折衷辦法以滿足其願望」。但渠不信共產黨要求在中國本部恢復一月十三日狀態在東北恢復六月七日狀態一點可以接受，「因已成者不能使其恢復原狀」，並謂共產黨係現實的，另詢以茍新辦法遭拒絕，政府之下一步驟爲何？以及政府是否將單獨進行政治改組時，孫氏答稱：</p>
<h3>如少數黨不來　政府自行改組</h3>
<p>「如少數黨不來，吾人不能加以强制」。渠調政府「大致」將單獨實行改組。渠以中國之局勢與印度之局勢相比，並稱：當魏菲爾邀請國大黨與回敎聯盟組織政府時，回敎聯盟初會加以拒絕，但當政府組成時，回敎聯盟人員改變態度矣。又詢以政府是否同意在國府委員會中以否決權給予共產黨及民主同盟，即使其在該委員會中佔有十四席一點時，渠稱：「否決權問題可予以討論，但因各方解釋不同而使此一問題趨於複雜。茍十三票能構成否決權，則共產黨並無理由堅持十四席。」但渠力言「否決權不能屬於一般性質，而應限於若干問題及若干情形，不然如少數黨能推翻多數黨所主張之一切問題，則將造成少數黨之獨霸，結果將無民主政治，而政府亦不能工作矣。」</p>
<h3>國大名單　今可發表</h3>
<p>〔聯合社南京以十五日電〕今日報　。國民大會各代表姓名，或將於明日公佈，內有邊省與婦女團體代表一百五十人及地方代表一百六十五人。</p>
<h3>未能協議原因　在於彼此猜疑</h3>
<p>再詢以如聯合政府成立能否滿意發展其效能時，渠稱：「此點胥視每人是否恪守一般規則，接受合理之建議以及視國家之利益重於黨派之利益而定，事實上惟有如此，聯合政府始能爲國結一致之政府而非意見分歧之政府」。孫氏於說明政府與共產黨要求雖頗相似（即維護政協及停戰協定）而未能獲致協議之原因時稱：「基本原因爲互不信與猜疑，以及對協定條款解釋之不同」。</p>
<h3>蔣主席邀宴　司徒美堂等</h3>
<p>白部長宴請蔡廷鍇</p>
<p>〔中央社南京十五日電〕蔣主席夫婦十五日在官邸邀宴民治黨中央常委司徒美堂，楊天字，及蔡廷鍇夫婦，錢新之，吳錢城等被邀作陪，席間司徒美堂會對該黨改組成立經過情形有所報吿。又息邵力子十五午宴請司徒美堂楊天孚二人，由參政會駐會委員吳貽芳等作陪。</p>

<h3>最高經委會條例</h3>
<p>立法院決議重付審査</p>
<p>〔本報南京十五日電〕最高經濟委會組織條例一案，立法院上次會議原決議暫從緩　，該院近率蔣主席五日代電，內程：「間於最高經濟委員會組織條例，於立法院審議時，立法委員中有主張該委員會不隷屬於國民政府，應改置於行政院節圍之內者，査此項機構之段置，早在決定主要經濟政策，以促進設全國經濟建，將由中央直接予以指導，仍以隷屬於國民政府爲宜，希對各委員予以間釋，仍照原定辦法，早予完成立法程序」該院十五日例會挖再提付討論，決議重付審査。</p>

<h3>若干袋形共區　可能提早肅清</h3>
<p>〔合衆社本埠訊〕張家口之失守，不啻爲中共軍事威望之致命打擊，所謂中國「放區域」，除東北以外，今已縮小至無足輕重之若干袋形地區，似有早日肅淸之趨勢。目前之王要袋形地區有三：一爲延安周圍之地區，衆信該地區田朱德親自指揮之中共精銳部隊防守。第二重要地區，在豫北平漢路與津浦鐵路之間。第三　　　　　　。　　　　運河一帶作戰之國軍成一狹長地帶，有被切成三段之危險。華中漢口以上之一大共產區域，已被國軍消滅其大部份。守衛延安之共軍實力究有多少，姑置勿論，共軍結集最多之地區，顯在東北境內，該處幾與接連延安之陸路完全切斷。此間有人猜測，中共一旦自行組織政府，可能以東北爲其首府，同時使中國各地之地下組織趨於活躍，在延安失守以前，可能受延安之指揮。中共在東北所盤據之最大城市爲哈爾濱，衆信巾共將堅守該城至最後、一刻。</p>

<p>〔本報南京十五日電〕英商業訪華團一行十二人，十五日上午十時四十分自滬乘英空運大　專機兩架飛抵首都。到塲歡迎者有外部禮賓司長李駿，經濟部　司長承洛，顧所長毓楨，社會部鄭參事若谷，市府秘書長陳祖平，英大使施諦文，參贊華麟哲，及海陸空武官等多人。該團團長鮑埃斯乘第一機到達，下機後，即與歡迎者一一握手爲禮，全體團員旋亦乘第二機到達，合攝一影後，即驅車赴寓所休息。鮑氏一行精神咸極愉快，對南京氣候亦表滿意。該團略事休息後，即於十一時三刻於英使館舉行記者招待會，英大使施諦文陪同出席，由團長鮑埃斯報告此來任務，略稱：本團受命於政府，來華目的厥在考察中國現在之經濟情形，俾便對此中英貿易有更大幫助。中國受戰禍最久，痛苦經騐亦最深，在戰爭期間，中國對經濟危機應付之努力，已著有成績，今後建國當更本此努力，本團來華，考察範圍遍及於交通·紡織·電氣·國際貿易等各部門，希望能得到解決問題之症結所在。談及中英貿易前瞻時，鮑氏稱：兩國間目前貿易，因情勢關係，數量殊爲有限，惟經雙方努力，已漸增加，中國市塲發展可能性極大，儘有涉足餘地，渠信俟局勢安定後，新中國即可建成，英國極願以物資助華復興，蓋英國經戰事後，正盡每一努力，以使出口得以增加，渴望物資之輸出，此次來華目的之一，即爲研究中國需要何物同時英國亦極需要中國之糧食與原料，貿易應爲長期性與互相往來者。並謂，尚未計劃與共產黨人士會晤。</p>
<h3>鮑氏答記者問　貸款談判不在使命範圍內　中國市塲絕不致爲美獨佔</h3>
<p>茲誌鮑氏與記者問答如次：（問）貴國來華是否準備與中國政府討論貸款問題，以發展中國工業，其限度又如何？（答）本團來華只限於考察工商業及發展兩國貿易，貸款一事不在本團使命範圍之內。</p>
<p>（問）英私人資本將來投資中國時，數量如何，着重於何項工業？（答）英私人投資中國工商時，其數量如何完全視中國政局之安定與否而定，至向何項工業投資一節，則待考察後始能決定</p>
<p>（問）亞洲戰事結束後，預料中國商業即將由美獨佔，貴國對此意見如何？（答）英國自然歡迎美國援助中國，尤其中國經八年抗戰後，工商業之破壞最爲慘重，中國商塲廣大，機會極多，絕不致爲美國所獨佔，中國戰後需要極大數量之物資以重新建設其國家，其中五年經濟計劃所需要之物資數量，最爲龐大，本團此次來華，考察中國工商業之急需，亦爲重要目的之一。</p>
<p>（問）中國可能提高進口稅保護其幼稚之工業，節省外匯，爵士對此意見如何？（答）對此無意見，此問題與本團使命無關。</p>
<p>（問）英國有何計劃在考慮中或已付諸實行，以保護英國在華之龐大航業及工商業之投資，目前是否正在考慮出售各航業公司或將其收歸國有，以便與中國航業競爭？（答）對前一問題不願加以答復，因不在本團任務之內，但將來如有侵犯英商利益時，則由英政府代表交涉；至後者中英兩國航業根本目的不競爭，而爲雙方交換物資，發展貿易，英國將援助中國，並非與中國競爭，中國需要之物資可由英出口，英所需物資亦可由中國運英。</p>
<p>（問）中英戰後貿易恢復之程度如何？（答）此問題不能答復，所需數字太多，此項材料將來可以供給。</p>
<p>（問）英國對中國之需要及中國對英國之需要如何？（答）當於考察後始能決定。</p>
<p>（問）關於沿海航業，英國是否向中國政府交涉許可，英方郵船及商船行駛長江上游漢口等埠？（答）此問題已由英政府派有專人密爾本與中國政府接洽。</p>
<p>（問）中英商約如何商訂？（答）此問題亦不在本團使命之內，不能答覆，此事由英大使負責，據個人所聞，中美商約談判已將成熟，中美商約或將較中英商約先行簽字也。</p>
<p>鮑氏嗣對英國增產運動談稱：英國目前政策，減少自己供給，不顧國內犧牲，盡量提高物品出口，例如在上海市塲中，可以買到之英國商品，在英市塲反絕跡，英國數年抗戰關係，在海外之無形資產已完全喪失，英帝國爲謀生存，刻出口貿易應比戰前超出百分之三十以上，此種情形，對中國印度等國家最爲有利，惟英國之海外市塲廣大，以目前之出口而論，仍爲求過於供，對中國及其他國家之盡量供給，須待英國恢復戰前生產力後始能達到。</p>

<p>〔中央社華盛頓十四日電〕國際緊急糧食會議，今通過增加米糧供應，以應中國分配量所需之決議案。此一建議，係由我代表陳之邁提出。陳氏要求該會首先研究英國及暹羅所訂之價格協定，並要求增加米價或獎勵出口，藉以增加暹羅之輸出量。蓋據悉暹羅米商以米糧實價過低，故停止其出口貿易。陳氏建議中，並籲請注意輸出之小麥及米糧間之相互關係，蓋巴西原擬輸出大量米糧，但因阿根廷不欲以小麥售予巴西，故巴西亦禁止其米糧輸出。陳氏告中央社記者稱，如該會對此議案能採有效措施，則僅此二國輸出之供應品，即足敷我國廿八萬噸之分配量。該會並已議決中國在暹僑胞贈送祖國之米糧，不在分配數之列案，僑胞所贈祖國米糧迄係列於分配量中，故該會今日之決議實已增加我分配量，蓋若干已送達我國之米糧，刻已認爲係我僑胞之贈品也。</p>

<h3>廿一國和會的閉幕</h3>
<p>巴黎廿一國和會，已於昨天午後二時閉幕，自本年七月廿八日開幕以來，迄今正是整整的兩個月又十八天，可以說是歷史上最長久的國際會議。在開會期間，各國代表對於戰後的歐洲問題，因爲意見的紛歧，利害的衝突，曾引起了不知多少次的論戰，使許多代表辯論到唇焦舌敝，還不能罷休，因此波瀾迭起；頗使世人對於巴黎和會的前途担憂。但是全世界的人民，莫不渴望和平，尤其在歐洲各國，更迫切地要求早日恢復正常狀態，對於各國政治外交家致力於和平的工作，大有只許成功不許失敗之勢；巴黎和會在這種客觀的條件之下，終於通過了對義·羅·匈·保·芬五國的和約草案，只待四國外長會議作最後決定，就可以簽字成立了。所以這次巴黎和會通過五種和約草案，無論如何，終不能不說是廿一國代表締造世界和平的初步成功。</p>
<p>回想起和會開幕之初，各國意見的紛歧，幾乎達於頂點，各國代表均站在本國的立塲上發言，都有她的一套理論和主張，很難有妥協的希望，尤其是若干國家代表的態度，幾乎完全沒有外交家的風度：辯論的時候，會辯到面紅耳赤；在攻擊他人的時間，所用的措詞跡近於漫罵。所謂外交詞令和國際禮貌，在和會中是很少看到的。所以在和會的初期，世人都認爲，很難使各國意見的紛歧，在和約草案中，縮小到最低限度。同時觀察和會的形勢，一望而知，就有着兩個對立的集團，一個是斯拉夫集團，另一個是英美集團，中法兩國雖然極願意做這兩個集團中間的橋樑，從中調和雙方的意見，而能獲致妥協辦法；但是仍未能消滅集團的存在；尤其是若干小國，不是在會中搖旗吶喊，甘心做大國的應聲蟲，就是會外花天酒地，不問和會的事情，聽任幾個強國去擺佈，所以在這次巴黎和會仍脫不了強權政治的作風；一切決議都操在少數強國的手裏。</p>
<p>到了後來，雖然設立了許多小組委員會，分別進行工作；但是仍無法推動，進行遲緩，任何小組委員會開會，終不免一塲舌戰，結果一無所得；而日月易逝，一週又復一週，使各國代表對於開會也感覺到厭倦，而聯合國大會又定於十月二十三日開會，轉瞬將屆，既不能再度展期舉行，巴黎和會自非在十月十五日閉幕不可。因此乃決定加緊努力，限各小組委員會的工作，至十月四日結束。這樣始能獲得長足的進展。但對於若干重要問題，乃採取避重就輕的方法，不了了之，至本月八日通過了對義和約，對羅·匈·保三國和約，亦相繼通過，十四日又通過了對芬和約，終算使和會獲得圓滿的結果。差強人意，在目前自可引爲快慰。</p>
<p>時至今日，世人都已明瞭，締造世界和平的不易，以視戰時獲得勝利，尤爲艱難。以歐洲和平而論，自去年五月納粹德國無條件投降之後，歐洲戰事即可視爲告終；但是直至今年十月十五日，僅能完成五部和約草案，尚須等待四國外長會議，作最後的決定，足見和平工作進展的遲緩。而且歐洲問題的核心，不在對義大利，對巴爾幹，對芬蘭，而在對德問題上。目下德國尚在英美法蘇四強共同管制之下，如何使德國早日恢復常態，使其在國際社會中，也成爲愛好和平的國家之一，自爲當前最迫切解決的問題。何況歐洲的鐵幕重重，東歐與西歐對峙的形勢，早已在醖釀之中，近來更加露骨了。但是四國外長前天開會，討論及德國問題，蘇聯外長莫洛托夫仍主張在歐洲討論德國問題較在紐約爲佳，美國代表貝爾納斯國務卿在原則上也表示贊同。準此而論，唯有至聯合國大會閉幕之後，四國外長始能重返歐洲，討論德國問題，其時必至十二月中旬或下旬了。</p>
<p>由此可知，這次和會完成了五部和約草案，雖爲走向和平的初步成功；但是締造和平不易，這一初步的成功，也足以鼓勵致力於和平的政治外交家，開始其更艱巨更繁重的工作，對德，對日和約，使戰後的世界早日步入和平民主的新時代。</p>
<h3>中央銀行業務會議</h3>
<p>中央銀行第三屆行務會議，於十一日開幕於首都；此爲七年前在陪都召開之第二屆行務會議以來的首次行務會議。七年前的行務會議舉行於抗戰的艱難階段，當時日本軍閥的狂熖，正在繼續高漲；如今第三屆行務會議的舉行，已是日寇降伏，最後勝利到來的時候。介於第二屆及第三屆行務會議之間的七年，是一個具有重要意義的歷史階段；而在此七年中，中央銀行先後在孔前總裁，俞前總裁及現任貝總裁之下，對於我國金融政策的推行，頗著成績；雖則我國目前的金融危機在日益加深着，但在抗戰期內，中央銀行如何協力於抗戰的完遂，當爲眾所周知，值得稱道的事。如今勝利來臨，此際而有行務會議的召開，檢討已往，策劃來茲，對於戰後金融的整理與我國經濟復興的前途，深信必有極大的供獻。</p>
<p>在中央銀行業務會議開幕的時候，蔣主席於日理萬幾之餘，特頒訓詞，有所策勉，可見主席對於此次中央銀行業務會議的關注，在此主席的訓詞裏，我們看見有這樣的辭句：「今後金融措施，應如何外獲國際之協調，內切經濟之需要，此實我中央銀行最大之職責，亦即當前最繁重之工作」。的確，當前中央銀行最大的職責，實莫甚於如何外獲國際之協調，內切經濟之需要。關於外獲國際之協調，自國際貨幣協定及國際銀行成立以來，金融業務日益趨於國際化，而我國目前又處於通貨膨脹的情勢下，如何健全我國的金融，整理我國的幣制，在在需要國際的協調。至於內切經濟的需要，則有關於機構性質的問題及機構的運用問題。</p>
<p>就機構的性質問題上言，在「銀行專業化」的呼號下，中央銀行尤其應該成爲銀行的銀行。自法幣政策推行以來，又加以抗戰時間的發展，中央銀行的地位，已遠較戰前爲重要，爲適應這種新的環境，政府正準備修正中央銀行法，以確定中央銀行的新地位。使中央銀行成爲銀行的銀行幾是舉國一致的要求，則爲如何使之成爲銀行的銀行是尤爲國人所關心。從消極方面言，中央銀行的地位既高於一般銀行，自不得兼營一般銀行，特別是一般商業銀行的業務，如匯兌貼現之類。就積極方面言，中央銀行的職權應該予以擴大，使其能够負荷成爲銀行之銀行的使命。觀乎此次中央銀行法修正草案所賦予中央銀行的職權，似乎除使其成爲銀行的銀行外，尚擬使之成爲惟一的發行銀行，一方面又欲使之具有「金融部」的性能。倘使中央銀行的機構，照此修正案的計議而改組，是中央銀行的職權雖然擴大，而國家的財政金融系統都不免蒙受不良的後果。所以我們主張中央銀行的職權固然應該擴大，但國家的財政金融系統，亦必須予以尊重。</p>
<p>第一，我們以爲將中央銀行直屬於國民政府，其總裁又爲特任官，這似乎與主管財政金融的財政部形成對立的局面。國家既有財政部的設置以管理國家的財政金融，則中央銀行似應隸屬財政部，歸財政部的監督節制，較爲合理。財政部爲主管銀行的部門，又有錢幣司以管理金融，倘使財政部所定的財政金融政策而得不到中央銀行的支持，且非形成僵局，使中央銀行在事實上形成了太上財政部。所以爲國家的制度著想，中央銀行的職權固應擴大，使其成爲銀行的銀行，其地位則應在財政部下，受財政部的監督節制。</p>
<p>第二，中央銀行之成爲銀行的銀行，並不在奪取應屬於財政部的權力，而在協助財政部對於這些權力的執行。使中央銀行成爲惟一的發行銀行，在原則上是應該贊成的；但這不就是說，中央銀行有決定幣制，及自由發行通貨的權力。對於幣制及通貨管理，權屬於財政部而不在中央銀行，後者僅在執行財政部所定關於幣制及通貨管理的決策而已。</p>
<p>至於關於業務上的運用方面，中央銀行既有銀行之銀行的任務，在目前產業凋蔽，民生不安之際，尤應「內切經濟之需要」，以活潑金融，是即迅予開辦轉抵押重貼現。目前工商生產事業，需用貸金，因通貨貶值，成本提高，需款龐大，商業銀行之貸款放款，殊不能滿足工商生產之實際需要，影響建設匪淺；中央銀行似應實踐其使命，辦理轉抵押重貼現，俾工商生產事業能够有所調節，轉趨活潑。其它關於業務上之改進，所在多有；此次中央銀行業務會議，既集各地該行首長於一堂，研討不厭求詳；則會議閉幕以後，會當有所改進，自不待言。</p>

<h3>殷墟望戰雲　東行軍指向共軍核心之大　名本報特派員邵愼之</h3>
<p>〔本報安陽十四日電〕安陽國軍李仙洲部，開始向漳河推進，戰事正於正東七十華里之回隆鎭進行，軍方向記者否認外傳國軍已渡漳河北上之消息，安陽受共軍威脅，不可謂已完全解除，並勸記者勿至郊外，以防經常發生之意外。記者於十二晚抵此豫北國軍最前方之城市，在過去數月中，國軍爲應付共軍襲擊，鞏固安陽之地位，曾與之不斷周旋於周圍二百里地區內，在安陽湖兩岸，始終採取絕對的守勢，入晚城內聞密集槍砲聲，尙爲經常之事。現東行軍係指向共軍核心之大名，軍方表示或將開赴該地。豫北冀南民性强悍，地方組織之四個自衛縱隊，實力頗厚，經常進出於共軍區域，於冀豫邊境頗稱得手，收復磁縣，邯鄲之謠傳，大抵由此而來。漳河北岸現仍爲共軍太行山通往冀南魯西孔道，安陽殷墟自小屯甲骨出土後，名震世界學術界，小屯在城西北，董作賓氏曾居此數年，今春聞有殷靑銅器出土，各處出土古物，民衆感於八年來戰亂之敎訓，多自動送地方政府保存。安陽原有古物保管委員會，所藏古物四噸，抗戰期間運有南陽，現已全部遷返，據悉毫無散失。著名之六河滿煤礦，在城西北九十里，戰前日產無烟煤六千噸，現在共軍手中，據來人談：該礦機器并洞已破壞不堪，豫北有機器設備煤礦，包括焦作在內，共十三家，日產煤總量一萬五千噸，其他星羅棋布之手工鑛尙不在內，但今日豫北竟成「無煤及無光明之區域，漳河兩岸之流亡縣政府，集於安陽者計十五個，其他機關則有一百十餘個之多，蓋以難民路　集，此彈丸小城人口自五萬躍增至十五萬人，秋風颯颯，四望聯雲，固不知何日可返家園也。</p>

<p>米商請取消出口捐</p>
<p>靑縣係屬產米之地，每日出口運申，計千石以上，自本年四月起，由第一區公所向米商每石抽出口捎米二升，査米糧出口捐稅，早經政府明令取消，鄰縣亦無是項米捐，詢之區署，謂係補助地方事業費，現縣府正向各佃戶借田糧補助，理應將此種米糧出口捐，速行取消，而事實上迄未實行，捐稅有增無減商民實不勝負担，懇請有關當局從速取消苛捐，以免商人損失（靑浦一米業員）　我是一個學生，眼見到許多弟妹們，因爲老不進公立學校，又受不住私校學費的高昻，失學了。現在，我以學生的地位，貢獻一點意見於大家。　最近，各地學校，都鬧「人滿之患」，尤其是上海，有數千名考而僅錄取數十名的事，這是很嚴重的問題。敎育是國家政治和經濟的連繫，第二代又是國家未來的主人翁，一羣羣莘莘學子，被屛棄在門外，他（地）們得不到敎育而怨恨，而憤怒，甚至閒散了身體，幹消極遠法的事，這對於國家前途，是很危險的。考其原因，不外乎三點：</p>
<p>（一）自從八年抗戰後，一般人的智識程度雖未提高，相反的，因爲戰時流徙，丢棄書本而减低，然而求智欲），遠較以前迫切。</p>
<p>（二）各地敎育文化機關，被敵僞摧毁，學校普遍减少。</p>
<p>（三）小城鎭及鄉村的農民，一大半隨了時代的洪流，捲進了都市裏。　要謀妥善解決，祇有治標一法，國家尙在混沌時期，敎有工作，不能順利推進，學校不能立時設立，師資亦感缺乏，又不能敎許多人不讀書，洽標方法，祇有改變學制——二部制及三期制，相互併用。</p>
<p>二部制是上課時間，改爲上下午二班，分班敎授，上午提　早，下午延長。三期制爲一年讀三期，寒假暑假减短，其優點有四：</p>
<p>（一）二部制可以增收一倍學生。</p>
<p>（二）三期制因修業之期减短，亦可增收學生，如中學本須六年，現四年完成，多餘二年，即可多敎學生。</p>
<p>（三）敎師生活淸苦，多敎後可多增收入，敎師生活，或可因此安定改善。</p>
<p>（四）國家正當勝利建國之初，人材需要殊殷，學生修業期限减短，亦可早爲國家社會服務。惟照上述辦法，也有缺點，譬如：</p>
<p>（一）敎程亦須澈底改革，在短短的半日間，時間已甚侷促，校中祇授學科，術科則由學生課外自己硏究，知中學裏的美術，音樂，習字等，一律取消。如有興趣，課外硏討，半日之時間足够。</p>
<p>（二）敎師雖收入略　，然過分勤勞，精神疲乏，唯有多設專門師資訓練所，敎師以性情相近，專司一門，功課不致過分煩忙，學生得益更深。</p>

<p>我是一個失學的苦孩子，因爲家裏淸寒沒有錢到私立學校裏去讀書，只好停息在家裏，有一天，我到馬路上去白相，看見一張（求知義務夜校招生）廣吿，（上課時間下午六點—九點）報告處（在常德路五五七號內，又冒名（學生總會）開學是九月九日我就立刻去報名，當時交保證金一萬元，給我收據一張，同學共有四百多個，過了幾天校長（沈守言）逃請遁，課也不上，招也招不到他的人，直到如今，還沒有信息，我想這一萬元錢，不是父親的汗血嗎？希望當局看了這件很悲傷的事，替我去捉到這個騙子校長加以懲辦，這是功德無量呢！（失學苦孩子陸金芳）</p>
<p>請考慮設夜校原則</p>
<p>閱九月廿七日貴報，載有「專科以上學校設立夜校問題」新聞一則，內有敎部決定原則：「專科以上學校得設立夜校，但此非正式學校，而係補習性質之學校」一條，敝人以爲此舉對於職業靑年之出路影響甚大，無異關閉職業靑年修學之門，値此生活困難，失學失業人數衆多之時，敎部似有加以考慮之必要。（慶豪）</p>

<h3>郭泰祺任末次大會主席　和會昨舉行閉幕式　南國代表不滿義大利和約拒不參加　四外長致詞互勉努力和平</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦十五日廣播：經過兩個牛月之討論後，巴黎和會終於今日下午三時（格林威治時間，上海時間下午十一時）召開最後一次會議，在此壓軸戲中，南斯拉夫代表有驚人之演出，宣佈南國不能接受大會多數所通過之對義和約，決定退出大會。此一幕挿曲，爲各代表所未料及者，其所採取之行動，與蘇聯代表葛羅米柯在安理會所採者如出一轍。先一美代表首先到會，蘇英代表繼之，皮杜爾最遲。主席爲中國代表郭泰祺，郭氏致閉幕詞，對大會成就備加讚揚，並謂和平不可分割，深盼各國消除成見，爲和平努力。郭氏旋官讀南斯拉夫來函，聲明南國代表退出之理由。至此，貝爾納斯繼起致詞，謂各國不獨應互相認識，且必須認識彼此應有之責任，消除成見，共爲和平努力。貝氏强調任何國家均不能單獨在戰爭中獲得勝利，同時亦不能單獨獲得和平。各國必須和衷共濟，爲人類造福。大會於通過五國和約一般建議後，即告閉幕。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕巴黎十五日緊急廣播：和會今日舉行閉幕，場中半圓形代表席上生氣蓬勃，爲歷次所罕見。至下午三時，各國代表大部份均已到齊。主席郭泰祺在三時十分主持開會，提議以暫時名義通過和會所作有關五國和約之建議案，因秘書處對條約原文未能及時分發之故。</p>

<h3>豬肉與美國會大選</h3>
<p>— 本報駐美特派員毛樹清</p>
<p>十一月初的國會大選舉就在眼前，作爲選舉競爭的最大題材，並不是內政外交的經國大策，而是當前嚴重的「肉荒」問題。華萊士事件，在美國也鬧得轟轟烈烈，但華萊士事件並不是影響選舉的主要目標。華萊士辭職的新聞電影在美國各地放映，觀衆中問有一半爲華萊士熱烈鼓掌，有一半爲貝爾納斯鼓掌；杜魯門總統的相片映出時，有少數人拍掌，有少數人呌「嗤」。這是美國社會一部份的民意測騐，也是美國人政治認識的一個縮影。但這些仍不足於影響選舉，習慣於物質生活的美國人拆穿說：他們對政治，都非常「無所謂」。沈寂了多年的共和黨，他們看淸了這點，因之，並不以華萊士事件和民主黨的「分化」作爲攻擊民主黨的藉口。共和黨的穴傳家，天天對老百姓說：「你們不是沒有豬肉牛肉吃嗎？選舉共和黨共和黨給你吃！紐約時報的星期增刋裏，輕鬆的挖苦了一句：「想不到肉荒問題成了當前的政治炸彈。」事實上，美國有的是猪牛牲畜，像我們外籍記者們在紐約天天「上館子」；有的是大盤大盤的肉食。彷彿祇有一天，我點一個「猪排」，堂倌說沒有，以後從來就沒有碰到肉荒。眞正飽經到「三月不知肉味」的是講求「經濟」的家庭主婦，她們所要的是便宜的官價豬肉，那倒是十回有九回失望。美國的黑市遍天下，要比起高明的美國式政治，那眞是何啻天壞？爲什麼黑市充斥？因爲有OPA—美國的物價管制局，物價管制局限制得愈兇，黑市的活躍也愈盛。美國輿論界對物價管制局的攻擊，每天都連篇累牘；但OPA一度計劃撤銷，終於仍然保留。哥侖比亞的學生，曾經散發傳單，發動學生運動。挽留OPA華盛頓的公務員眷屬曾經在國會門前示威，反對撤銷OPA，他們說：OPA制度是羅斯福總統遺留下來的「德政」，如今美國通貨膨脹如此猛烈，一且OPA撤銷，企業家發財，公敎人員更苦！但是，從無論那一隻角度看，今天OPA的存在，多多少少是阻碍生產的。共和黨的下議員羅傑士前天在國會說：「請總統立即想緊急辦法，撤銷OPA；物價一放任，生產便踴躍；根據供求律，生產一多，物價反而會下跌。」他又說：肉荒問題容易解決，關鍵在總統的決心如何。物價管制局發言人在記者招特會上說：「盲目的共和黨議員，整天在胡　，他們懂什麼經濟學？」他根據農業部專家的統計，說肉荒問題在兩個月之內，可以完全消除，到明年初，肉類供應，便會過剩。他發表談話的第二天，紐約的屠宰商八十餘人聯名上書給總統，說明他們停業的苦衷；特別指責農業部專家的謬論。他們的信內說：一設若政府之現行管制政策不予改變，則不僅兩月以後，肉荒不能解決，即兩年以後，亦將永遠失調。」美國銷數最大的報紙紐約每日新聞，幾乎每天有照片·圖畫·評論，攻擊OPA，他他們登了很多停業肉舖的照片，還刋了許多菜籃中「空空如也」的家庭主婦。芝加哥的情形也是一樣，百分之九十的肉鋪早已停業；一萬五千屠塲肉舖的職員和工人，現都在失業狀態中。無論如何看法，像這樣的失調現象，終是民主黨政府一個競選的大危機。杜科門政府竹經召集了好幾次內閣會議，討論抵制這一顆議員競選「炸彈」。陸軍將領擁護現政府，國防部首先「以身作則」，宣佈該部所屬全國官兵購肉量每星期减少三百萬磅，使一般人民有較多購到猪肉的機會。農業部長安特安特遜永遠持樂觀論調，他胸有成竹地對外宣佈：肉荒問題雖然嚴重，但情形巳在好轉。他舉出「聯邦屠宰公司」爲例，說九月的第三星期，聯邦屠宰公司計宰猪七萬八千頭，較之八月份第三星期增加一萬三千餘頭；依此類推，兩個月內，常全部恢復戰前原狀。紐約時報的記者郝斯敦從華盛頓發電至紐約說；安特遜故作樂觀論調，「確否可於兩月內證明之」。杜魯門自己頗有點左右爲難，他在內政上的苦悶徬徨，和他在外交上的手是無措，有相同之處。他說：OPA在目前是不能撤銷的，但怎樣補救物價管制的流弊，他始終沒有說出一個道理來。與論界對杜魯門政府，很有許多說不出的味道。紐約世界電訊報畫了一幅杜魯門在酣睡的漫畫，窗外的陽光已經射入室內，但總統仍然在擁被高臥，旁邊寫著：「杜魯門先生，醒醒吧！你的國家正遭逢著危難呢！」華萊士被逐出內閣的第二天，華府方面傳出：物價管制局長波特有出任商務部長的一說，許多平素不滿OPA的言論界，都爲之驚惶失色。後來發表了哈立曼繼任商務部長。紐約每日新聞說：「天哪！幸虧不是這傢伙！」電訊報和每日新聞都是接近民主黨的報紙。民主黨的一代偉人羅斯福，如今仍然爲美國老百姓歌誦着；然而羅斯福留下來的內政外交上的「德政」，現在都走到了十字路口，繼續前進呢？還是趁此轉灣？杜魯門感覺着左右兩難，美國老百姓現在都在想：吃膩了的口味，是不是應該趁此機會變換一下呢！（九月廿九日，紐約航訊。）</p>

<h3>接收大員貪污凟職的下場　姜公美執行槍決　原判徒刑五年半奉令改處死刑　被捕至行刑整整一年　遺書六通自稱愛國者</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕前上海憲兵隊長美公美，因貪汚凟職侵佔等罪，經人吿發，於去年十月十四日深晚由淞滬警備司令部派員予以逮捕，一年來輕轉押解，曾解至南京，重慶，最後仍奉令發　淞滬警備部審理，經軍法處一度會審結果，　判有期徒刑五年六月，並已解送上海監獄覊禁在案，前日午後該部接奉國防部法核（卅五）字第〇一九九四號代電節開：「被吿姜公美應改處死刑，褫奪公權終身，仰即遵照，並將執行日期連同照片具報備查。」遂於昨晨十一時將姜犯自上海監獄提回司令部看守所，時美犯身穿黃色西裝襯衫，外罩絨線背心，下着藍布工裝褲，灰襪，黑皮拖鞋，面容憔悴，因見戒備森嚴，知已凶多吉少，故祇所後，即索取紙筆，繕寫造書六封，分送共父母妻子等，至午後二時三刻，重由特務連士兵將其提出，經徐課長宣讀罪狀吿以即刻執行死刑，如有遺言，當可轉達，姜犯態度自若，僅謂「我是一個愛國者，我不是軍人，死後請新聞界多多搜集我的資料」，旋即加以綁縛，背插斬條一支上書「奉令槍決貪汚犯姜公美一名」字樣。押赴宋公園刑塲，立即執行，計開二槍，均由背入，由胸腹穿出，倒地畢命，屍體由普善山莊收殮，收殮之時，始由夫役將綁繩解去，草草裝入一薄皮棺木中。查姜犯現年卅二歲，徐州人。（圖爲槍決後之姜犯）</p>
<h3>糧貸案人犯案卷　今日移送地檢處</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕轟動一時之糧貸舞弊案，經奉　主席電諭移送司法權關審理。淞滬警備司令部遵令於今日將全部人犯，連同案卷，移送地檢處。</p>
<h3>市參議會　警政委員小組會議　方志超劉學海出席報告禁政</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕市參議會警政委員會，於昨日下午三時在福明邨該會舉行第二次小組會議。到該組議員十八人，由侯寄遠任主席。警察局宣局長代表方志超及內政部江蘇兼上海區禁烟特派員劉學海列席報告。</p>
<p>方處長首光報吿本市義務警察組訓情形。並稱遵照市長指示，應將義警人數擴充至一萬人，現正計劃招考中。方處長繼述本市禁烟情形謂：本年一月十二日中央法令核下後，禁烟工作，即分三期進行：（一）自一月至三月爲登記自新時期，至三月底止所登記烟民共計六千零六十人。（二）四月至六月爲勒令戒絕時期，六月底猶米戒絕者即予偵緝。（三）七月一日起起爲　騐時期，分兩部分：凡有　無讀者歸煙毒調騐所調騐，有毒無毒者　衛生試騐所。但因經費有限，調騐所由市府撥經費一千七百八十集餘萬元，又加調騐收入總共二千一百餘萬元。致煙民衣服均自備，而有夾帶等各種流幣發生。</p>
<h3>登記調騐困難甚多</h3>
<p>登記方法有二：即地區傳騐與全面調騐，以年齡作次序，幼者先騐　吸烟者以三十五歲爲最多，最小者爲十九歲，最長者七十六歲。但調騐時發生困難甚多，如登記人住址變更，無從傳到，假登記者亦頗多，蓋於敵僞時期有往登記而可配給烟土者，故至今尙有人抱此忘想前往登記者，此外有頂替調騐者。致應傳騐者二千餘人目前傳到者僅一千餘人。而吸食者往往不異化錢，弊端叢生，故希定量檢舉。</p>
<h3>禁煙三原則</h3>
<p>旋在劉特派員聲稱：本人任務在督導及考核地方上禁煙工作，中央禁烟政策在勤敎，嚴懲及保育三項原則。禁烟乃建國先決條件。上海區禁烟工作雖已做到成績良好地步，但仍嫌不够。戰前調查上海烟民，在內政部登記者達四萬餘人，當時人口僅三百萬。八年抗戰敵八施行毒化政策，現在數目至少比以前爲多，故向上海市民呼籲共同協助政府肅淸烟毒，由市參議會主持推動。北平天津等地市參議會均組織禁毒小組，上海方面亦希望有同樣組織，否則希望能盡量發動此工作　後各議員紛向方處長提供意見，經方處長補充報吿警局對終禁烟工作煞費苦心，對販毒者亦嚴加緝查，加强出口調查，緣據報外洋輪船由滬駛往馬尼刺者船上亦查獲鴉片嗎啡等毒物。又如召集下級探目辦理調查，利用警犬嗅查等均在進行。</p>
<h3>禁煙禁毒工作　通過辦法五項</h3>
<p>最後討論大會交議提案一件，案由爲擬請市政府加强禁烟禁毒工作，並將搜獲毒物按月焚燬以防流弊由，決議通過辦法五案：（一）應確實偵查毒品來踪去跡，防杜軍警庇護賄縱。（二）各級機關搜獲之毒品，不論多少，應按月公佈用途，集中公開焚燬，以免日久滋生流弊，以昭大信。（三）檢舉工作除由市民自動檢舉外，復應督飭各局警員嚴格執行。（四）檢舉者必須予以獎勵獎金，請市府指定的款。（五）檢舉尺度應放寬，倘屬誣吿必須反坐。至六時散會。</p>

<h3>傷兵慰勞第一團團長　鄧文儀招待記者　闡述慰勞徵兵整編撫卹各點</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕國防部新聞局及傷兵慰勞團第一團，昨假新生活俱樂部招待記者，由局長兼第一團長鄧文儀將軍報吿，就新聞局業務，傷病官兵情形，慰勞情形，徴兵，編餘官兵，傷亡撫卹等點，有所闡述。</p>
<h3>成立新聞局</h3>
<p>鄧將軍稱：新聞局已成立三月，主管部份有三：（一）一切關於軍隊之報道及敎育事務；（二）軍事立法與聯絡；（三）與社會上建立關係。鄧氏謂該部已負資將全國以至全世界之與論，就關於我國軍事者，加以搜集，整理，分析，然後儘速送呈各畏官作爲參考，並印成小册，分發全國中上級軍官。同時並將各項有關軍事之資料，負責發佈。至該局發段機構，有（一）軍事新聞通訊社，已於雙十節成立，至遲於下月即可於上海成立分社；（二）靑年軍出版社—陸續印發各項軍事刋物。</p>
<h3>組織四團分別慰問</h3>
<p>關於傷兵慰勞問題，在八年抗戰中，國軍官兵傷亡綦重，勝利時負傷者。尙有十萬，至上月止，尙有七萬人。主席深表關切，曾有三次以上之慰勞，最近國防部已成立慰勞團四團，舉行慰問，順便考察醫院設備及傷兵生活情形。第一團，負責京。滬。杭。福建·蘇北·皖北·魯南·膠濟一帶；第二團，負責武漢·鄭州·西安一帶；第三團，負資河北·山西；第四團，負責東北。自雙十節已開始出發。</p>
<p>鄧將軍親自主持第一團，來滬已三日，視察本市傷兵醫院三處，分院一處，共收傷病官兵約二千人，內官長約百分之五。一般而論，生活情形尙好。來時曾帶慰勞金及慰勞品若干，每人可得口糧一小袋，棉質衫袴一套，鞋襪各一雙，毛巾一條，小册子數本，此外並各得慰勞金自五千元至五萬元不等，深望民衆亦能見議勇爲，踴躍輸將，以慰英勇之戰士。</p>
<h3>關於整編</h3>
<p>國軍已自五十九個軍減至五十九個師，編餘軍官達十六萬人，彼等或已退伍，或則編爲預備役，因整軍方案及停戰協定之未能實施，至今未能轉業，希望能於三個月至六個月間，有解決辦法。彼等百戰餘生，望社會上能予同情及安慰。七</p>
<h3>徵兵方面</h3>
<p>兵役法現已通過，雙十節起已開始實行。徵兵制爲立國之本，任何國家，必須兵役制度確立，然後可以成軍。過去因準備不足，徵募容有流弊，今後當力求改進，務期於一年半載之後，能得精編軍士一二百萬人，但徵兵必力求公平，新兵之待遇及服裝，亦必求改着。</p>
<h3>陣亡將士照發卹金</h3>
<p>至傷亡將士，八年抗戰期中，統計雖不精確，然估計當有三百萬人，然此中國防部有案可稽者，尙不足五十萬人，彼等大多已有家室，孤兒寡婦之生活，未死者應負責任。國防部撫卹處最近前來登記奢祗五萬人，或係登記手續比較複雜之故，故現已改善，祇須證明確已死亡，即可照發卹金，每年家屬可得數十萬左右，並有稻糧補助，凡於陣亡將士有關者，亟應本救死扶傷之責，廣爲宣傳，並向國防部報吿，稍慰英靈於九泉。如此事能獲妥善解決，則萬一不幸國家有事，可勵來茲，關係甚大，輿論界實應廣爲宣傳也。</p>
<h3>國家統一始有和平</h3>
<p>鄧局長詞畢座中有要求鄧氏以國防部發言人資格，對大局發表意見者。鄧氏謙稱本人原係一軍事記者，願以記者立塲，作一觀察。繼稱：國軍實以眞心誠意，希望國家早日統一，不願再見戰事。惟自一月整軍方案發表以後，中共始終不能體察政府政治解決之苦衷，實可痛心。六月七日，第二次停戰令下後，國軍日處於挨打之地位、最近二三月來，共軍動員令下，到處「淸算」，「鬥爭」，老百姓飽經塗炭，實已不堪容忍，故國軍爲救民於水火之巾，始作反擊，蓋交通不能恢復，民衆實無法生存也。惟「不打不成相識」，共軍當已知今日國軍之力量。惟國軍始終祇求軍隊國家化，如整軍方案能够實施，國軍初無戰學之意。蓋國家必須統一，始有和平，余深信如兵役法能實行，交通能恢復，則軍事衝突，或亦即可停止也。</p>
<h3>經部派美技術人員　第二批昨返國抵滬</h3>
<p>我國在租借法案巾於去年由經濟部派赴美國實習之技術人員。其第一批一一四人，已於八月間學成歸國，其第二批九三人，亦於昨日下午五時，由美抵滬，同船返國者，尙有農林部，交通部各技術員多人。資委會上海辦事處，定今日下午三時，假國際飯店十四樓，舉行茶會，招待該第二批抵滬人員。</p>

<h3>走出化通臨江被俘　皇室迷夢成泡影　稀世珍寶一場空　溥儀弟媳嵯峨浩　滿腹辛酸話往事</h3>
<p>戰爭犯罪處理委員會東北督導組，奉命前赴東北督導日橋俘之遣歸及戰犯之淸理，本年九月十六日該組組員鄥伯翔，於錦州日僑集中營內，拘獲溥儀之弟溥傑之日範夫人嵯峨浩姬，（年三十七歲），及其七餘次女　生，女　熊本正君，業於日前經平轉解抵滬，日內押京歸案。中央社記者昨晨曾訪嵯峨，此一皇族後裔，今日作階下囚，含羞話往事，實不勝感慨系之。</p>
<p>緣僞滿是帝　儀，其第溥傑，及二格格，（旗人姊妹之意）三格格，五格格同出一母，尙有澊任六格格，七格格係另一母所生，現隨溥儀之父醇親王居於北平，溥儀等則居於號稱「新都」之長春，前以溥儀后秋鴻（日籍）無出，當時日人欲使朝鮮之歷史，重演於僞滿，乃壓迫溥儀，於民國二十六年三月一日頒佈皇室承繼法，而以九一八事變之主兇日本關東軍司令本莊繁爲媒，於同年四月三日，以日本嵯峨實勝候之女嵯峨浩，與溥傑完婚，蓋欲以溥傑之子，來日承繼僞滿皇位，惟婚後產二女，長名桂生，現留東京，决名　生，即此次同遭拘覇者，幸以抗戰勝利，日人之陰課，遂化泡影。據聞嵯峨能操流利之國語，而與記者晤談時，始終不作華語，昨嵯峨衣黑色旗袍、套以綠色羊毛短襖，黃皮鞋，頭髮亦如時下婦女之新式梳粧，若非其脚腿粗大，初視之，則不疑爲日婦，其女傭亦穿藍色旗袍，惟嵯峨面形消瘦，狀頗憔悴，言下時現難色，蓋其不忘身爲「王妃」之尊也。</p>
<p>被俘經過</p>
<p>據嵯峨談稱：當日本投降之翌日，即八月十日，溥儀率弟傑及皇后貴人宮內人等遂出奔通化避難，溥儀偕弟溥傑，即擬飛日，然以通化機小，容油不多，乃乘機至瀋陽，預備換機赴日，惟至瀋陽易機之際，即遭蘇軍俘去，此時嵯峨與皇后秋鴻等聞訊，即離通化東至臨江，企圖由朝鮮轉日，未不幾共軍攻陷臨江，嵯峨等被執，所有溥儀等隨身携帶之希世珍買數箱，悉被共軍掠去。至此，嵯峨誇耀其皇室珍品之多，據談宮內大部寶物，遺留長春，自被蘇軍取去，而溥儀所携帶者，皆爲希世之物，渠深信每種珍品，世界均僅此一樣，但當共軍掠去時，其傭人曾將少數錢財，藏於枕頭內，故能幸免，但事隔兩旬，共軍兩度光臨，雖藏於枕內之、少數錢財，亦已一掃而空，同時溥儀之后秋鴻，又被共軍囚以鐵籠，任人笑罵，加之秋鴻素有芙蓉癖「一代皇后」備遭屈辱，即吿香消玉殞，時宮內隨行人員先後逃逸，嵯峨母女與二格，三格，五格同押往哈爾濱。</p>
<p>化裝有術</p>
<p>嵯峨至哈市後，即喬裝日僑，易名浜口，僱用熊本正君爲傭，深居簡出，月前共方李立三至長春交換遺歸日僑之意見後，嵯峨母女乃雜於其中，企圖返日，沿路一般日僑俘，悉伊等爲皇族，莫不多方掩護。戰犯罪犯處理委員會東北督導組，雖存有嵯峨之結婚照片，然以渠之化裝有術，亦不能得。最後始獲悉於錦州集中營之某室內，乃率兵前往，雖曾遭日俘高級官員隱匿，但終於査出眞相，而加逮捕。嵯峨解抵北平後，曾要求至醇親王府，一探其翁，獲允後，亦由該組組員鄥伯翔伴其前往，解滬後，因不滿膳食，渠更書一「余乃溥儀皇帝之弟媳」字樣，要求改善膳食云。</p>

<p>蒙吐凡尼稱：德國投降以後，歐哈德局繼續僱用意籍報務員，並以戈培爾式之宣傳方法表示對於意大利之關懷而誘致彼等繼續工作。彼本人於一九四五年五月八日以前所祖任之工作係收錄國外電台之播音，並截取中國航空公司關於國境內飛機動態之通訊。此外則係搜索在安南境內之英美地下電台。迨德投降消息傳來，被立即脫離該局而至某一酒店任侍者之職，但至一九四五年六月，現爲被吿之一的拉斯基即來我彼謂有工作可做，囑其至小沙渡路該局謁見主持人歐哈德。</p>
<p>歐哈德對彼說明該局已重起爐籠，並力言德人對於意大利之關懷而觀彼繼續工作。</p>
<p>此後與彼同進歐哈德局者尙有意人三名，惟彼等之工作僅限於收取塔斯社之電訊而已。當時候之月薪爲僞幣四十萬元。</p>
<p>蒙吐凡尼證述畢，被吿辯護人飽定中校起立稱此輩意大利報務員之　給係由日本官吏付給，此外並得日本當局之麵粉配給，故不能親爲歐哈德局所僱用。但檢察官杜威則提出一反證，係前上海日軍部會計Kengo之口供，證明彼經由一日本聯絡官之手曾付款與歐哈德局，而在德國投降以後所付之款額更爲增加云。</p>

<h3>逃稅種種　娛樂酒菜業一點手法　這是過去敵偽時期的老話　現在卻不能保證一定沒有</h3>
<p>〔本報特寫〕這不是什麽人贓並獲的貪汚的揭發。我從多方面搜集到一些資料，祗是說明上海雖有鉅量的納稅，却並沒有一點一滴地都歸到市庫裏。我在這裏所叙的都是老話——一些受人注意而無人提起的老話。我所以不說些新鮮的，是因爲手頭沒有充分的證據，怕負法律上的責任。</p>
<p>在渝陷時期的上海，稅的走漏，早就成爲很普遍的現象。我這裏要說的是戲館·舞場·咖啡館和菜館。因爲這裏每天有大量的消費者，每天有大量的捐稅，也有大量的走漏。</p>
<p>老式菜館</p>
<p>僞財政局對於老式菜館的捐稅，最沒有辦法。他們並無會計制度，他們採用信任式的帳簿，祗在賣出東西的時候，簡單地在簿子止記那麼一筆。此外，就什麼也沒有了。僞財局沒有權力呌他們請一個會計師，他們要是在簿子上少記一些，捐稅的走漏就異常可觀。譬如當一個老主顧吃完了飯，堂倌把賬單等上來的時候，總笑迷迷的巴結着客人說：「捐沒有給你寫上」。以便容人慷慨地把那份捐稅充作額外的小賬。要是那個主顧是帶槍的，他一定聲勢洶洶的說：「混蛋，我也要捐稅嗎」？自然，這一嚷的代價便是免捐。可是所免的捐，老闆不會掏腰包，彌補的辦法，當然是簿子上少記一筆。簿子上既可以少記一筆，少記二筆，三筆，以至於無數筆，又有什麽關係呢？可是貪心太重，畢竟有些危險的。當滿屋子都是人氣和酒氣的時候，查捐的突然降臨，就有很多的破綻會被發現。假如這一屋子的賬已超過賬簿上任何一天的總收入，那就足以說明過去的營業報吿完全不可靠。結果，罰款，罰停業。記得有一次罰款之大，就是把那家菜館變賣了也還不行，那家菜館自然祗有關門。</p>
<p>咖啡館</p>
<p>咖啡館的經理，爲了怕伙計舞弊，會計制度大多訂得很嚴密。各種賬簿，各式　據，應有盡有。這無疑的給了査捐的許多便利。但是他們依然運用心計，設法逃捐。雖然那些三聯單，頁碼，會使他們覺得礙手礙脚，他們却並不因此而放棄這筆意外的收獲　有一家咖啡館，爲了印有頁碼的售貨三聯單的牽制，它特地僱了一位女職員，每天繕寫另外印成的爲三聯單。如同正式的一樣，這上面有日期，有貨名，有售價。經理囑咐她多寫不納稅限價綫以下的東西，如一杯紅茶，一杯咖啡之類。一直寫到預定每日的營業總額爲止。此外，這位女職員還得做一點最簡單的購貨銷貨以及開支賬。整個辦公時間內，由這位女職員一人佔有這賬房間，其他的司賬員都在外邊賃屋辦公。査賬的來了，就由這位女職員去對付。若間：「賬爲什麼道樣簡單」。回答是：「生意壞，人手少」。問得仔細時，她就說：「賑房先生出去了，我也不大淸楚。」這樣，査賬的稍微對上一對，就在賬溥上蓋了一顆「査訖」的圖章走了。而咖排館呢，每天偸稅的收入，遠遠地超過了營業上的盈餘。但第二次另外兩個査賬員到來的時候，却被他們抓住了漏洞。原來經理貪心太很，他以爲査賬旣已來過，寫僞銷貨單毋需太認眞。意思是紙張不也浪費過多。他說：「査賬的看見一大堆三聯單，早就頭痛了，誰會一張張的仔細看。」査賬員對他們營業單位的稀少發生了疑問，接着他到收銀櫃拿了當天的賑單一看，半天所做的已經超過了以往每天的總數多多，再一細君，發現頁碼距離很遠。那位女職員便解釋說：「今天生意特別好……賬單隨便拿來用，根本沒有汪意頁碼。」等到査賬的走了，經理馬上到偽財局找人疏通，後來雖然處罰，却罰得很少，這中問疏通顯然起了作用。</p>
<p>戲館</p>
<p>戲館中以京戲館偷稅最兇。最初，偽財局馬虎，他們賣出的票子，到散塲前又收回來。到了月終，隨便向僞財局報銷一點就算。其次是贈劵收的捐，經理全數中飽。之後，僞財局因爲稅收少，變更辦法，每排位子的票子訂成一本，票子必須到僞財局去蓋章；票子撕下，即算售出；票子必須撕三段。繳捐時，必須把票根帶去。這辦法的確很嚴厲，而且執行得也很嚴格。也時常有人到戲院去査捐。這使經理們大大的感到恐慌，於是推派了一位代表，秘密地到偽財政局去走門路。目的自然是爲了疏通。雖然後來仍然有人到戲院裏去查捐的，但經理們已不再愁容滿面了。據說，這一次的「聯絡」，範圈很大，包括蓋章及點票根的。</p>
<p>一般的設來，人民總是壓惡捐稅的。然而經理們例外，他們是捐稅的擁護者，理由是：（一）一部分的偸稅。（二）全部份侵吞贈券稅。（三）遲延繳納三個月，以此作爲高利貸的本錢。</p>
<p>但不知爲什麽，曾有一家規模極大的京戲院，竟被査出偸稅，受了處分。</p>
<p>舞場</p>
<p>舞場的組織是混亂的，經理們便混水裏撈魚，從中大事偸稅。茶賬數目小，還沒什麽。舞票數目大，就用了手法。</p>
<p>手法很簡單，舞客買給舞女的舞票，向賬房間去掉取現款後，賬房間又重新把那些舞票賣了出去。但經過幾次嚴査，他們也就與僞財局有了一聯絡一。</p>
<p>另一種逃稅是永遠無法破案的，那是一些老舞客，爲了巴結所歡，直接把現鈔交給舞女。這是旣倫捐而又逃避老闆的剝削的。</p>
<p>上面所說的祇是各種各樣逃稅中的一麟半爪。我不是說現在還有這些現象，但我也不敢担保說沒有。</p>

<h3>答復讀者　醫藥衛生</h3>
<p>（一）療肺新藥</p>
<p>陸良敏，王鳴鳳歧問前閱貴報悉華大企業公司經售美國肺病特效藥　Streptomycin友人某君患肺病有年屢醫無效，不知該藥對於斯疾，是否有效？茲有問題二則，祈賜答復（一）此藥現在滬上各大醫院及醫師已臨床採用否？（二）此藥對肺結核有確實根治之效能否？</p>
<p>〔張仲明醫師答〕　Sireptomycin乃與靑黴素相似，係用病菌培養而產生之一種抗毒素，從動物試驗結果，對殺滅肺結核菌亦可見效、但對人體肺結核之絕對效能，尙未見諸文吿。美國市上已有此藥出售，上海尙無現貨，各大醫院及醫師亦未作臨床試用，故筆者不敢確定其效力如何。</p>
<p>（二）產後體虛</p>
<p>王怡汶問敝人自去歲八月市旬停止授乳後，患月經不調，經水甚少，至最近手足常感麻木，夜間多亂夢，惟身體比前增胖，雖經中西醫診治，未見有效，目下診金費用甚大，力有不逮，又未知究患何病？請示治療方法。</p>
<p>〔張仲明醫師答〕貴恙宜作婦科檢查，以求究竟，若用卵巢製劑注射，或可見效。</p>
<p>（三）左足抽筋</p>
<p>章洪倫問　余年廿一，身尙健，幼時曾患臘膜炎，現在右足略跛，惟行動一如常人，並無不便，前曾受汽車輾傷左足，亦早已痊愈，惟此左足自受傷痊愈後，每屆睡熟時（已有三年餘）常自抽動，但並不自覺，醒後即止，且抽動决數甚頻，未知有否醫治之法？（一）與患腦膜炎有關否？（二）施行電療有效否？</p>
<p>〔張仲明醫師答〕左足自己頗動，係神經刺激所致，宜注射維他命B1，及燐酸製劑，與腦膜炎可能有關係，電療亦可試用。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕本市吳市長自兼任經濟部紡織事業管理委員會主任委員後，已定於今日上午，前赴江西路該會辦事處，正式視事，惟並不舉行仟何儀式。原任兼主委束云章，仍兼該會委員。此外並加聘中央銀行業務局局長林鳳苞爲委員。其他副主委李升伯及委員等，一切照舊。內部人事，刻仍未聞有何更動。惟近日來內部正忙於趕辦交替手續。</p>
<p>又該會自於十一日起，開始接受各紗布廠商，申精登記紗布南銷事宜以來，迄昨日止，已赴該曾索取申請登記書者，運銷商有四百一十家，生產商有一百七十八家。據該會業務處長劉文騰君稱：索取申請登記書之期，將於明日（十七日）卞午五時截止。已索得申請登記書之各廠商，務希於廿日以前，將申請書塡送到會，以便彙集審核。過此期限，勢將留待下月，再行審核。待新主委到任後，即將派遣調查員，根據塡送之申請登記書，從詳複查。此項複查工作，可望於廿五日以前完成，俾便核定各廠商資格後，再行接受南銷紗布之申請云。</p>

<h3>浮多爭先脫手　市況終難振作</h3>
<p>昨日市塲交易淸稀，仍難振作，塲內全由散戶點綴，上塲時即吿微昻，檯面帮有買，形勢吿穩，微微盤升，十時三刻以後，冒氣稍蘇，兩大熱及信和即吿上騰，形勢堅定者達半小時之久，終吿不支而退，浮多於晨初時納胃過勇，此後漸成斬多局面，加上北帮有售，面目全非，空方再來施威，近午慘跌較題，結果較前收計永紗美亞景福均吿小挫，新光微升而勤興尙平，統益信和中紡榮豐內衣公司麗安火柴五和均跌落少許，大通新亞華豐水泥微漲，景綸絲業平平，總成交額計八三七萬股，塲外各股續跌。外股近午受股市影響，兩大熱仍形不振，過程則因交易不多而平和，結果較前收計怡紗英聯會德豐小挫，餘者尙形平定</p>
<h3>債市人心渙散</h3>
<p>公債格於大勢，人心無興趣，新多遂觀望，統丙二〇三〇元，開後曾微升至二一二〇元，於是散多陸續了結，股市助長賣氣竟回降至一九〇〇元以下，始吿平定，結果較前收下挫一五〇元，甲乙亦跌一二〇元，丁戊各降五〇元。</p>
<h3>陳茶高檔步俏　新寗紅未有成議</h3>

<p>他若高紅茶，英莊亦唾涎三尺，市勢悉帶秀色，至於紅綠茶內銷，本街店莊尙有添置，客帮各路依然淹滯，然人心猶穩，查日前由忠信昌茶棧首批運滬之寗州新紅茶，賣買談判賡續擯持，尙未開盤。</p>

<h3>促進僑滙　準匯到後再結價　滙往香港者準付港幣</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中國銀行爲促進僑匯起見，曾有舉辦原幣匯兌之計劃。茲悉：該項計劃，已於雙十節後付諸施行。該一辦法，與舊有匯兌辦法稍有不同。即匯款毋需在交匯時，即行折合國幣數額，而係待匯款抵達目的地之解款銀行後，再按當時之官價匯率，結付國幣。惟匯至香港中國銀行分行時，准予結付港幣。該項辦法頃已於紐約（包括加拿大及美洲本部）倫敦（包括英國本部）兩地實施。他如南洋，古巴，澳國等地，以幣制折算較爲　複，尙待陸續實施云。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十五日電〕抗戰勝利以來，各地僑匯湧至，負責辦理僑匯之中國銀行，亦就實際情形，積極設法改革，務使其能妥速寄到，該行國外行處之先後復業者，已有仰光河內海防新加坡檳榔嶼吉隆坡等行，荷印各地因時局關係，未能立即設行，現正擬就吧城機構先行恢復，至泗水棉蘭等地機構，一俠當地環境許可，再行恢復，此外西貢亦正籌備設行，又該行爲减少譯音困難，並節省電費計，曾舉辦僑胞電匯登記，截至目前止，已登記者已達十二萬戶，僑胞稱便。（兪）</p>
<h3>絲織廠登記已辦竣　人造絲即將配售　外埠絲織廠亦可酌量配給　投機者又故意抬高半光貨</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕絲織廠向中央信託局請購人造絲登記卡，已於昨日辦理完竣，惟配售辦法，有待最後核定，本週能否配出，目前尙難決定，聞因手續關係，或須下週方可實行，現外埠如杭州等處，亦均有代表來滬，請求登記，已得中央信託局同意，可以酌量配售，昨外埠代表，在新都飯店宴請本埠同業，以資聯絡云。　昨日人造絲市價又吿抬升，一二〇號天橋有光，做四百四十五萬元比上日漲二十萬元，半光等竟高卅萬元，因傳中信局將配給之貨均係有光貨，於是執貨者視爲奇貨，故意抬高，廠經毫無動情，價站原盤，綢貨亦甚閑散，行市無變化，交易實淸淡。</p>
<h3>外鈔的側面觀察　官方措置未能使人安心　民衆期待法幣的發行額</h3>
<p>〔路透社南京十四日電〕外幣限價宣佈一週後，南京之公開外幣市塲仍頗動盪。近數日來，美鈔之非官價兌換率已更爲活動，顯示當局最近採取之若干措置，尙未能使市民安心。首都每日之外幣交易雖不甚多，但路旁之交易已見美金一元折合法幣四千零五十元之新高價。此點一方面固可示國家之經濟未能趨於穩定，但亦爲限價後極合邏輯之結果。外幣限價之宣佈，使一部份外幣買賣者消滅，但事實上亦造成公開市塲上外幣之人爲的缺乏。中立觀察家指出：政府之遲遲不願宣佈紙幣發行額‘，使民衆對現行通貨不能立即予以充份信賴。緊張期待之空氣依然存在。黑市價格他降之速，往往猶如野火。例如今晨，各方突有吐售美鈔之情形，以防跌價，因照過去經騐，此種情形能在數小時內發生。此外國內之政治軍事局勢，對於外幣價格之波動亦有若干影響。</p>
<h3>金價過程平穏　美鈔黑市微小</h3>
<p>烚赤昨平穩逾恒，晨開二一九萬，開後極爲平和，曾自二一九萬五微現小挫，浮多稍有了結，降至二一八萬，始告緩和，在二一九萬元光景盤旋不已，十時後央行配給十八條，價爲二一九萬，入後逐漸由平定轉呈小穩，客銷仍活，近午會回升至二二一萬三，午刻在二二一萬光景獲旋，午後隔日交易升至二二二萬外，而後稍平，結果較前收漲一萬六，飾金紋銀元均平，暗拆銀根平後又緊，暗息自一角半至一角八。</p>
<p>外幣平靜少變，美鈔暗市中喊價的四二〇〇元至四三〇〇元，成交不多，較前收略賤，港票因港申電期鈔續吿上升，結果較前收下降十元，港匯初時在九〇〇元光景，後以金市刺激，扳高爲九〇〇元至九二〇元，印匯一一一〇元至一一三〇元，英匯一四五〇〇至一四七〇〇元，美匯仍平，成交僅港匯稍活外，餘者均乏對做。</p>
<h3>中砂軋升</h3>
<p>昨糖市升降互見，上落不鉅，尙稱平穩之局，公會劃盤現貨二十號中砂白以軋現關係，回好二三千元，做至十四萬一千元，生砂赤平平，僞十一萬九千元，號貨有汕帮開出高提靑十一萬七千元，决之五六千元，黃崗靑十一萬三千五百元至二千元，共一百五六十包，廣帮開出慶元高片靑百數簍，九萬九千元至十萬元，興化帮開出興赤十三萬元至十二萬六千元，比前小二三千元，建帮開刁靑八十餘包，十萬〇八千五百元至八千元。</p>
<h3>財政部擬發　卅六年公債說</h3>
<p>財政部發行公債，自卅一年起，均採派募勸募辦法，向民間銷售，自三十四年起，即停止發行。現卅六年國家預算收支不數甚鉅，聞財政部主管方面，已在軍定擬卅六年公價之具體方案，緣公債條例，須經過立法程序，需時甚久，故下年度如擬發行公倩，目下不得不着手籌備云。</p>
<h3>華絲美銷停頓　美按月配售日絲</h3>
<p>外銷生絲，自美政府標售日絲以後，已大受影響，頃悉：美政府決定按月配售五千箱，我生絲益感威脅，近來已屬有行無市，美進口商有此五千箱之供給，對我國產生絲，咸抱觀望態度，以致生絲外運，已告停頓，據悉：中信局此次收購之三千餘担，亦以美市價低落，尙未決定去路，擬且先行運美，待善價出售。</p>
<h3>小麥相互買賣　公會呈準變通</h3>
<p>近來本市小麥價格波動甚烈，社會局已通令上海市豆油雜糧公會禁止行與行間交易，以防投機抬價，茲據雜糧公會方面消息，謂此項買賣，實係委買委賣，皆是實銷，絕非投機交易，已呈社會局請予變通。聞該局已准如所請，但如逾越此限度，發現踢皮球買賣時，仍將嚴格禁止。</p>
<h3>米市來源絡繹　雜糧繼續下降</h3>
<p>米市供源頗旺，閘北河下存積，仍有二百艘左右，約三萬石之譜，市塲客貨登記一萬餘石，市形依然早堅午懈，店方納胃零屋，結果粳米略呈疲勢，秈米則中下等帶小千元，白元依然牢立，黃豆東北來貨不及前日湧旺，高貨微挺，但豫鄂皖贛來源不斷，故中下者依然少神，菉豆津浦南段存到兩豐，去化不振，步跌千元，紅糧回小三五百元，芝蔴漢口來源獨多，續小千元，生仁高定次削，豆餅外埠消胃僅汕頭略取，價格平穩，蠶豆消化轉淡，回跌二三千元，油市到消兩稀，暫乏榮辱。</p>
<h3>小本貸款　市銀行決定舉辦</h3>
<p>家庭工業貸款已减少　人力車夫貸款尙未定</p>
<p>市參義會前向市府建議，請市銀行舉辦低利小本貸款，據市銀行負責人稱小本貸款處之設立，已在考慮中，目前該行正舉辦兩項貸款，一爲二億元，敎育貸金，一爲家庭工業貸款，至家庭工業貸款，專係扶植家庭手工業，試辦以來，成績良好，最初之放貸最高額原爲每單位一次申請貸款二百萬元，然最近接奉行政院命令，規定最高貸款額不得超過五十萬元，因此已將貸款額予以調整，至外傳人力車天取締後，將由該行貸款之說，該行尚未接獲市府訓令，惟小本貸金，短期內必可舉辦云。</p>
<h3>卅二支紗漲廿萬　本街客銷均清淡棉布回小</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日紗市始挺終回，晨初一度喊高五七萬特雙馬成交二百卅五萬，因廣帮來訊，粵價甚高之故，旋以出龍者衆，價遂逐步下游，結果仍較前日好二三萬，人心略見平淡，獨卅二支藍鳳，在求過於供情况之下，一度哄至三百萬元，收市回降至二百九十萬之譜，仍較上日漲起廿萬之巨，四十二支曾高至三百六十萬因織廠需要頗殷，一時尙難看小。</p>

<h3>得心應手一帆風順　征輪又擊潰巨人　勢如破竹西人一籌莫展　結果四十比二十八分</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕征輪籃球隊第一役敗於仁餘之後，不免失望，但自前夕擊退汕隊，令人刮目，昨晚又發揮其固有之實力，竟然在絕對優勢中克服本市西人巨頭巨人隊，觀衆無不嘆爲意外之作，實則征輪之逐塲能有進展，並非偶然。</p>
<p>敏捷爽脆氣足</p>
<p>綜觀征輪之優處。爲動作敏捷，出手爽脆，更賴其長力充沛，自始至終，盡情發揮，殊頗覺其作風演出，固與羣聲另有一種風味。個人方面于瑞章，屠文龍之活躍，完全大將風度，射籃已見純熟，誠不可輕視之。巨人則昨完全在頹勢中，上塲受到四比二十落後之比數，難免爲之氣短，射籃之不順，亦有莫大關係。</p>
<p>征輪氣燄萬丈</p>
<p>因巨人誤卯，比賽延至七時廿分開始。裁判宣鶴皋兪菊盧，征輪首以屠文龍·蔡忠強·于瑞章，張根生，秉煥五將出塲，巨人則爲浮尼克，史梯文遜，陶勃林基，凱捷密洛夫耶龍應敵，屠文龍先開紀錄，史梯文遜立還顏色，但自此即見征輪發揮威力，操縱局勢，于瑞章屠文龍探籃如囊中取物，頃間以十二對二領前，復以二〇對四佔先，巨人一籌莫展，後巨人一再趕上，全力以赴，上半時逼成廿五對十五，征輪還是佔先。下半時，巨人一度廿三對廿七，唯征輪後勁正足，復以張根生調下，由劉政軍進球，又見節節領導，巨人雖亡命反攻，無如征輪固守嚴密，直至終塲，征輪以四〇對廿八，戰敗汕隊之後，又多一佳構。</p>
<p>征輪　得分</p>
<p>于瑞章　十七</p>
<p>蔡忠强　六</p>
<p>屠文龍　十七</p>
<p>劉振軍　〇</p>

<h3>解放區的解放</h3>
<p>— 五日淮陰訊　本報特派員抗舟</p>
<p>在寂寞的淮陰街頭，我像一個狩獵者似的踽踽地走着。我的眼睛婦過每一間房子，每一塊廢墟，每一個居民的臉孔。我冀圖尋覓出一絲痕跡來證明共產黨對外煊染的「解放區』「輝煌」的成績。最近一星期來，我走過不少地方，像宿遷·泗陽，淮陰和淮安，這裏，以前都是共產黨的所謂「解放區」，經國軍一再予解放，我比急急等待還鄕的難民先踏入這些曾經是「神秘」的區域。我接觸到的是坦露了的「解放區」的眞相，及生活在那個空氣裏的人民。我看得不少，聽得更多，但我認爲抱歉的是，我所獲的材料，是共產黨諱莫如深的美麗的外衣下的瘡疤。</p>
<p>一路上，我沒有看見過一個眞正的像人的人。我見到的彷彿是一批才從牢獄裏出來的拘禁多年的囚犯：蓬亂的頭髮，灰黯的臉孔，枯瘦的身軀，站在風前像立刻要倒下去。掛在身上的，如果說是衣服，不如說是布條或布塊來得恰當。只有女人的褲子是補綴完整的，小孩子大半光着下身，甚至全部裸露，像一段木炭。只有一樣，他們營養不足的眼睛已經有了光輝—當他們倚着破門，陳設了積滿塵灰的香案，迎接進駐的國軍那時候開始。</p>
<p>那一天，國軍來了。一個光屁股的小孩子在香燭上黏了一張紅紙條，寫了「歡迎中央軍」五個字，走在隊伍的前面。</p>
<p>一個白髮老婆提了一壺茶，走過來，顫動地說：「班長，辛苦了，喝一杯吧！」</p>
<p>劫後的人民幾乎全流了淚。他們說：「你們再過一年不來，我們便將完全餓死！」</p>
<h3>深入民間訪問　他們的心曲如怨如訴</h3>
<p>靜靜地，作一番深入的訪問、每個人向我傾訴了他們的怨曲。這眞是一段慘痛的回憶！</p>
<p>去年八月，日本投降，國軍運輸不便，共黨乘機而入，侵佔了華北的大部。蘇北土地肥沃，連年又一天災，在敵僞蹂躪下幸未傾家蕩產者，狂風暴雨式的共黨的「鬥爭」來了，把剩餘的一掃而去。於是，富的鬥窮，窮的鬥光，光的怎樣？只有迫着你衝鋒。</p>
<p>去年冬天，在肌寒下死亡的，總共有數萬人。</p>
<p>共產黨抬出的招牌是「人民」，這是一齣滑稽戲的好聽的名詞。事實上，共黨只有黨員，沒有人民。而愚蠢的黨員，則是黨魁爲達到私慾的工具。他們的鬥爭據說有個目的，是「窮人翻身」。把地主的田地鬥爭過來了，參與鬥爭的有功人員，各自分得二畝田或三畝田。你做了主人，地主變成了窮光蛋逃亡了，便算是窮人翻身。但分得的田地一年的收成，共黨有各種各樣的微捐方式，於是，十分之八貢壓於使你「翻身」的黨。看着「黨官」吃大米，吃白麵，你自己亦然吃喬麥，吃高梁，這就是「翻身」！　極盡愚弄之能事的，是共黨表揚的「勞動模範」，「戰鬥英雄」之類。如果，像牛馬般工作，是增加野心家更多稱兵作亂的本錢，被稱爲「勞動模範」；如果，以瘋狂的行動攻城掠地，陷全國於更大的不安，被稱爲「戰鬥英雄」，將爲這兩個名詞痛哭！</p>
<p>共黨攻擊官僚資本，不造餘力，可是「解放區」的一切商務，完完全全是黨營的。人民無經商的自由。一個黃包車夫說得很幽默：「只有我們這碗飯，他們沒有搶得去」。自糧食以至日用百品，物無鉅細，統由共黨統制。一個正當的商人，假使不加入共黨或不跟共黨黨員勾搭一番，休想有飯吃。因此，民脂民膏搜括淨盡。人民無隔宿之糧，今朝不知明朝之事。</p>
<p>偶而有一份人家，吃了一次肉。吃得很秘密，隣居的都不知道；但共黨特務人員却神出鬼沒地聞到了「肉香」，突然來「友好」地訪問你了。他們自知他們的搜括工夫做得極到家，如無特殊來源，決無可能吃肉之理，便對你懷疑起來，把你作爲鬥爭的對象。這種「聞香」者確有一種組織，可謂廿世紀奇聞之一。　共產黨員自己的享受則甚爲豪華的。雖然，地們的口號聲聲是「勞苦大衆「，「吃苦耐勞」，但人類孰不喜愛享受，有了那麼一槐任令宰割的士地，爲什麼不享受一下呢？李一氓是蘇皖邊區政府主席，他的公館在淮陰安樂巷四號，我特地去參觀了一次。淮陰的房屋都是舊式的，李公館則在東方情調中帶着西洋色彩。據隣近的人吿訴我：屋內陳設非常考究，滿壁書套，俄國地毯，西式傢俱，沙發數奮，陳列與收藏之占玩，不可數計。有人看到他在撤退時，前後有數十輛大車搬運細軟。我去的時候，還可看見一部份沒有搬走的書畫傢俱，其中有兩張床頗名貴。一張是烏木細藤製的，牀架嵌以大理石，一張大概是夏天用的，全床除木架外，均是玻璃。還有一樣，是一隻洋磁澡盆，這雖不算什麼，但在淮陰僅此一隻。可想李氏之懂得享受了。</p>
<p>爲要鞏固他們的統治，不得不進一步遇化人民。他們對小孩子便開始下功夫，所有的敎本，便是一套思想的訓練。對成人，除供用恐怖手段，隨便對一個不中眼的人加上「國特份子」名義殺戮外，幾乎每天召集開會，不管你有事無事。在會中，大放厥詞，作用是要修正你的「中央腦筋」。</p>
<p>這種開會方式，還有一項作用是他們所謂的「民主」方式的運用。一項計劃要實施，爲了尊重「民主」，要通過「民意」，便召美起來問：「你們贊成不贊成？」心驚胆顫的民衆便在某些人領導之下表示贊成，於是乎「民主實現」。</p>
<p>在婦女方面，他們亦有幾種組織，如婦女會，姊姊隊。共黨大唱「婦女解放」，「提高婦女地位」，這確然做到了。不過，婦女被提高在如何一種地位上，却不可思議。老百姓肯定地吿訴我：當「戰鬥英雄」自前方歸來，當「勞動模範」一舉成名，需要慰勞的時候，婦女會，姊妹隊便須派人給予最「溫明」的慰勞；列爲此等組織主要工作之一，並引爲不勝榮幸。總之，是不勝枚舉。「解放區」是天翻地覆，鷄犬不寗。</p>
<p>投機份子，經威脅利誘加入了他們的組織，一進去，他就弄得你非死心塌地跟他走不可，他叫你犯罪，殺人，以致非藉他們的勢方便不可能在這地方上立足。</p>
<h3>民眾伸長頭頸　望中央</h3>
<p>良善的人們每夜暗暗地哭泣，一個五十九歲的婦人受不住壓榨，欺凌，感嘆地說了一句：「爲什麼中央軍還不來呢？」</p>
<p>隔牆有耳，共黨特務人員過來了：「你要中央軍來嗎？』</p>
<p>婦人氣慣不過，頂上一句：「看你們橫行到幾時？」</p>
<p>這一下，婦人被吊了起來，吊在一顆樹上。底下的人問她：「中央軍看見沒有？」她忍住痛：「沒有」。於是，吊得更高。她再亦忍受不住，大喊：「看見了」！繩子割斷，婦人掉下，死了</p>
<p>這樣「望中央」的慘創，發生過好幾次。暴力與恐怖政策終於不能久持，國軍來了，眞正地解放了。「解放區」。那婦人沒有失望，雖然她看不見；但今日收復區的新生氣象，不正是她所期望的麼？</p>
<h3>豁然的轉變　蓬勃的生氣</h3>
<p>鳥黑的牆壁經過洗刷之後，貼上了新的，刺激性的標語；最難的人漸漸進了城，帶著一個笑容，商店慢慢地開了門，雖然陳列的貨色不多，却還像個樣子；淸晨，嘹亮的軍號聲冲被沉默的大地，戰馬仰重長嘯，車輸的轉動聲和殺豬的聲音混和着……淮陰城有了一番蓬勃的朝氣。</p>
<p>最近以來，淮陰可以作爲蘇北各收復區的代表是罪過了一次豁然的轉變，不應該說是回復了它自由的而貌。人們不必再去開那牢什子的「小組會議」了。你喜歡怎樣處理生活，沒有人干涉你。共黨一年來企圖建立的新秩序，在一妙鐘之間全部不存在。駐軍政治部在牆頭大書：「尊重各城市民情風俗」！人們看了有無限的安慰。</p>
<p>句糾紛事件，不如想像之多。一得了不應有的田地的人，不說掠　廢話，便交了出來。抗弊作廢，遺棄得比長掉一張汚紙還爽快。老百姓受了是損失，還忍得住氣。他們在開始接受抗幣時，就想到有一天會廢棄它。共黨搜括的技術固然高妙，老百姓在地窰裏多多少少還存留了幾個銀元。共軍敗退前，混亂中，他們亦搶購了一些共軍携走不了的廉價的物資。等國軍來了，有物資的拿出來換法幣，沒有物資的，用勞力來廉取生活的代價。、他們起初不知道法幣的價値，一斤猪肉只賣八十元。太便宜了，買客大都是國軍—過意不去，多給了一些。後來的交易是照銀元定價，如果貨品値一個銀元，便給法幣一千五百元。這樣，暫時避免了混亂，可是，人一天天增加，物資來源缺乏，物價禁不住扶搖直上。</p>
<h3>觀音庵·油燈下　淮陰縣長埋首般公事</h3>
<p>復興以來，工作最吃重的是縣政府，處境最可憐的亦是縣政府。淮陰縣政府舊址毀了，設在一所觀音庵裏。晚上，油燈下，疲乏的縣長埋着頭看公事。無論什麼人，只要有點來歷，無不要縣政府設法這個，設法那個。但縣政府從流亡到入境，帶來的只是幾個人，沒有一點物資。</p>
<p>批評政治配介不上軍事，不錯。但替地方政府想想，人力，物力，財力，那一樣不困難？</p>
<p>人力：縣政府沒有得力幹部；當軍差，沒有那麼多伕子。收復區除早已流亡在外的之外，年靑人給共黨臨時拉走一批，留下的非老即少，非殘即廢。有幾個年靑人，怎够得上需要的數字？</p>
<p>物力：共黨可能携走的物資已經携走，未曾携走的數處各區，下落不明。黨政軍團室（中央調查統計室）合組的接收委員會接收的物資，只是少數的少數。如何處理？還要候上面批示。而爲了軍事需要，架橋樑，築工事，要材料，何處有？難上加難？</p>
<p>財力：江蘇省政府發給流亡縣政府的復興費是一千五百萬元。從流亡到入境，一切有關復興准備及復興設施的費用全在這數字一內開支。收復員滿目瘡痍，百廢待舉，一千五百萬能做幾件事？復了員，地方經費即須自籌，省政府每月發給臨時補助費一百萬元，將來還得歸還。地方是破破爛爛，人民是劫後餘生，財源顯然是一個零。我佩服收復區行政人員的工作精神：只吃飯，不可能拿薪水，一天累到晚，挨駡，設不定還挨打，毫不氣餒。</p>
<p>救濟，有蘇北難民救濟會議，善後救濟總署蘇寗分署及社會部等在分別辦理。急待救濟的，幾乎是收復區全體。需要救濟的，不但是食的問題，而且，大戰之後，疫病在流行，沒有醫藥；寒冬將至，受難者缺少棉衣，房屋受毀損的頗爲不少，居處亦成問題……。</p>
<p>救民於水火，得有一段過程。收復區民衆的生活問題，現尙朱有改善，可是他們說得好：「我們已經有了希望」！不讓他們的希望落空，是行政當局必須再三警惕的！</p>
<p>適用於緩流河川的土砂堤磚砌工程（特派員江暮雲奇）</p>
<h3>臺省公路水利工程</h3>
<p>— 九月廿二日北航訊　本報特派員江暮雲</p>
<p>以三分之二山岳地帶構成的台灣海島，在地勢上顯然與國內大陸不同，一般人對於台灣都犯有認爲看法過高的錯覺，其實海島的風景綫，脫離不了南洋與日本的混合作風，不過一般的建設，都具有較好的基礎而已。</p>
<p>目前台省公共建設工程，偏重於以建浩住宅爲中心業務的營建局，屬於民政處，以及致力於公路建設和堤防修築的公共工程局，屬於工礦處。救濟分署在本島的最南端被炸最烈的恒春，造了數百幢平民住它，但這是屬於臨時救濟房荒性質的。</p>
<p>本島公路　一萬七千公里</p>
<p>日入在台灣，最初統治的二十四年，化了不少本錢，交通和水利是其重點之一，但一部份到戰期便停止，一部份又給戰爭破壞了，停頓的現在要把它存續，破壞的又得重頭修起，這工作是艱鉅的，但又是必需的。</p>
<p>合灣全島面積爲三五·九七三平方公里，有九百多公里的鐵路綫，更有一，萬七千公里的公路，包括省道長一·〇三一公里，其中百分之十，即九九，三〇公里舖有高級的柏汕路面，縣道總長二五〇〇公里，其中百分之十五的三八六公里已舖有混凝土或瀝靑路面，其他百分之八五都是碎石路面。鄕道總長一萬三千公里，都只是稍舖碎石，甚至有的地方僅通行人及牛車。</p>
<p>省道，也就是環島公路，實是本省的財富，佔有80　100以上的經濟便値，現在全綫還不能通車，長約二公里有卅二價孔的濁水溪橋，自民國二十九年完成了橋墩，現在公共工程局準備短期內將原有的鋼樑設計改變爲鋼筋混凝土懸樑式，照該局的佔計，可較原設計省却50　100的建筑費。</p>
<p>銜接東西的唯一交通綫——屏東台東綫，全長一七三公里，六四公里可以通車，而在一〇九公里之內的知本溪大橋，以二千百萬台幣於本年二月問開工，預計在十月中完成後方可通車。</p>
<p>日式工程　目前已被遺棄</p>
<p>橫斷中央山脈而自台東花蓮港到台中一綫，全長一七三公里，其中一段日本人六年間只完成了十公里，而最艱巨的六十公里一段，因爲有長的三一四八公尺的隧道，這工事需費九萬萬元台幣，該局準備放棄，因爲綫道南端只多走了三十三公里的路程。</p>
<p>過去在西南公路服務的費　局長說，配合着台省的經濟建設計劃，他們得在一年內完成西部幹綫，全長三五〇公里的路面舖築混擬土的計劃，而在三年內建築十七座大橋，同時要改善最險峻的臨海公路——自蘇澳至花蓮港閒的路基。他更說明了日本人在這裏所建設的公路工程，爲了省錢，都是不經久的，更無法抵抗颱風的襲擊。他舉一個淺近的例子說，在山地築的路面旁，日太人祗將山坡砌起了一座壁，而我們（費自稱）則需要建築擋土牆的。一種日本式的工程方式顯然被遺棄了。</p>
<p>運輸力低　公路局感困惑</p>
<p>在台省，日人建築的公路，大部與鐵道平行，過去主要作爲軍用的，現在却表現了它的價値，因爲臺灣的鐵路器材，全部要仰給日本，目前就沒法補充，運輸方减低以後，即連運煤到港口、現在也需要汽車和公路了。管理運輸機構和增進運輸效力的公路局華局長，他在巡視本島一週後坦誠地對記者說明了目前的困難，全省有客運公司二十家，貨運七家，各公司民股佔58　100。在他視察的二十三家中，有二一四五輛客貨車，賣際能行駛的祗五四二輛，車少地廣，運輸力不足，而行車路綫也自四三五八公里减短到42　100，一八五九公里。公路局最近以美金每輛一九一〇元的價格買了廿四輛新車，而趕製車身每輛却需台幣二十萬，這是一個不堪擔負的負擔沒法開源，祗有考慮徵收養路費，在本島這是創舉，但已獲有各公司的同意，錢副局長很有趣的給記者提供了一張以一車一公里爲原則計算的成本賬單，照他們的估價，它所消耗的是汽汕6.20機油0.80輸胎7.50折舊1.80黃黑油0.29司機及行政費2.00管理費3.00其他086共計二七，五元，平均一車以二十人計，每人應得一元零五分，共二十一元，照現在的規定，已經要虧本六元五角。但在公署所定的方針下，是不容給人民再增加擔負的。</p>
<p>河川工程　特別需要考慮</p>
<p>公路之外，目前最重要的公共工程，是水利，修築堤防是該局最重要的當前課題。本省的溪流，雖沒有「臺灣溝」的險惡，但不論急流或緩流，以地勢和地質上的特殊性，都具有非常的兇暴性，臺省雨量每年平均二五〇〇公厘，爲世界第二多雨地區而降雨期之集中性更堪驚異，而遇淫雨爲災時，破壞力更不可想像。一般的河川特徵是縱斷面傾斜陡急，洪水量極大，枯水量極少，流水　多土砂石　，以致流路轉變無常，這些條件，使河川的施工法需要多予考慮。</p>
<p>日人在民前十四年至民三十一年的四十五年間完成了臺灣河川工程堤防總長四十七萬公尺，省內主要二十九道河川的治水計劃，已於二十二年完成。光復前數年，戰爭影響了建設，使全省河川成爲放在任不管狀態，因此發生各種災害。當時各主要河川因受災損壞的堤防護岸及排水等工程約長三萬五千公尺，接收以後，去年度政府所支出的災害修復工程費一千四百萬元，修復了堤肪和護岸三八九五公尺，但這個工程，祗佔急需修復工程的十分之一。費局長說，若要恢復民國三十年以前的原形，恐至少需要六年！</p>
<p>石堤工程　採用三個方式</p>
<p>該局對本省的河川施工，大都採取了這三個方式：</p>
<p>（一）對付急流河川，採用漿砌塊石及鐵絲蛇籠護岸的石堤工程。由河底裏檢取卵石，就地編製了鐵絲的蛇籠，這雖然較爲粗簡，但有撓曲性，對於急流河川的護岸，功效極大。可是對最急流的河川並不相宜，有時需要以鐵條省頭前溪和烏溪都採用這樣的工程。</p>
<p>（二）在河底土質多少卵石和細砂的緩流河川，都用磚砌坦坡，將磚塊各穿二孔連起來成一整體，像曾文溪和淡水溪下游都採用此法。</p>
<p>（三）在次等急流河川，則用框架透水壩工程，材料是鋼筋混凝土柱或舊鐵軌建築，宜蘭濁水溪及烏溪中部都用這個方法。</p>
<p>小YVA　收復民心不少</p>
<p>費局長特別提出，在動工中的台南阿公店堤，他剖開八張照片拚起來的現在進行工程中的圖樣，這個治水工程，使用一千以上的工人，機器，電力，本年四月起開工，每年完成百分之四十，預定三七年完成。這條堤的價値，可以防止八萬市畝的農田免受洪水流冲擊，更可以灌溉九萬市畝的農田、他說這是台彎的小YVA。</p>
<p>工程局有八個工程隊分佈在全省，這些實地苦幹的技術人員，他們不怕熱濕不畏癔疫，爲本省的交通，水利工作着，他們在荒僻的山間海濱，在洪流沙溪，他們直是行者的先鋒隊，保護人。當記者問起此中苦樂時，費局長說，台彎究比西南餐風飲露的情景好得多了，他還可以乘着卡車沿公路作第二次全省的視察，他可以在短的旅程里到達任何一個鎭市！更因水利關係人民生活，在條築的水堤旁，他更能親切地體味到民情的溫暖，這在收復已失的民心上，具有決定的意義。</p>

<h3>參觀塘沽新港</h3>
<p>— 九月廿四日瀋陽航訊　本報駐瀋記者趙展</p>
<p>說起塘沽新港工程的基礎是日人搜刮我民脂民膏奠定的，費時五年，工程已完成一半。民國廿六年日人曾建議與宋哲元共同建築，抗戰軍興，敵人更迫切需要我華北大量出產的煤，鐵，鹽，乃積極努力築港，企圖增加運量。廿八年六月正式成立機構主持其事、廿九年十月興工，原來計劃很大，完成之後每年可容三千萬噸之貨物出入，後因事功艱鉅，改爲每年容入百五十萬噸之計劃，至三十四年九月敵人投降時止，已築成第一碼頭，第二碼頭。新港工程非常偉大，我於此有一感想，敵人刧奪我民財，還可以做出點事情（常然他是爲了加强其刧奪効率），我們自己己拿老百姓的錢做不出成績來實在講不下去。敵人旣然已打下根基，我們如不能照計劃順利完成，可眞是不成材的敗家子了。</p>
<p>常敵人投降時，他們破壞了一部份，電氣設備俱遭破壞。據說設計岡樣及重要文件焚燒了一整天。我們自己破壞了一部份，就是有一個時期根本無人管理，可是無知的老百姓貪利盜走了軍綫，拆毀了房屋，可能是軍隊幹的，一個頑皮的兒童也會敲破電桿上的瓷碍子要瞧瞧裏而有何秘密。交通部正式接收的時候已經是破破爛爛的了。如記者所見的，原來的工料都變成一堆堆的爛鐵，一堆堆的爛本頭，就整理工作一項說，所費的人力財力就大有可觀，這是可以節省下來的，終於是浪費了。</p>
<p>十月動工</p>
<p>先完成大水閘</p>
<p>十月初可正式動工，第一步工程是完成一大水閘，日人已築成十分之八。永閘築成後船隻往海河內航就便利多了，不必再繞港口防泥沙的長堤而直達海河。水閘航道最低水位五公尺，最高八公尺，漲潮時九公尺，三千噸的船隻往來無阻。預計最近完成，今年結冰層以前可開船來試航。新的港口工程計劃最近才確定下來，現在還沒有公佈，與日人原來的計劃有些不同，噸位容量與日人原計劃相符，每年在八百萬噸以上，計劃在三十八年底完成。今年度經費預算是七十七萬萬元，明年度是四百萬萬元。</p>
<p>兩道大堤　對付淤泥海浪</p>
<p>新港大概的模型，築兩道大堤，一防永定河下來的沙泥淤塞，一防海而的風浪，長度都在千公尺以上。中築四個泊船碼頭。次爲由港口通海河的水閘，有兩道閘門，並有倉庫及市區。第一，第二兩碼頭，日人原已築成，現航道淤塞，須重新挖決，第三，第四兩碼頭僅壩平一部份陸面。日人原有一座規模宏大設備週全的變電所，可惜遭澈底破壞不能利用了，第二碼頭上有兩部裝煤的機器成了廢物。記者見兵軍圈用了第一碼頭，小型登陸艇沙丁魚一樣的排列，美兵坐在吉普車上讀什麼有趣味小說？五隻挖泥船稍加修理就可以開始工作，有二十餘個日人技工被徵用爲我服務，前日人修築時候的正副局長山田三郞，檜山千里留用爲技術方面之資詢，最近山田且與港務顧間徐燕謀往東京接洽要日本父出前在東京製浩築港所用之機器。器材等，此項交涉原已由我代表團武官朱世明將軍與麥克阿瑟總部洽妥者。</p>
<p>三年築成　地位較滬優越</p>
<p>港務工程處的副總工程司田述基先生說：就技術的觀點而言，北方大港比塘沽新港容易建築，以經濟的價値而言，則塘沽新港遠較北方大港爲優，因天津北平兩大商埠在其背後，將來鐵路修復，新綫築成，交通四通八達。形勢確是如此，北方大港爲天然深水港，塘沽新港是硬是硬用人工開鑿的，爲華北貨物吐納之第一大口。再過三年新港築成，每年以貨物納量之八百萬噸，加上天津之六百萬噸，就比上海優越了，天津在華北的地位可與上海在華中作競賽。</p>
<p>形同廢紙之杭幣　（特派員杭舟寄）</p>
<h3>裝束入時的女流　原來是人口販子　總機關設在澳門　利用傭婦作誘拐綫索　七日香港航訊　本報特約記者凌芳　一個七八齡孩童每名值百萬元　變成臺山開平諸縣僑胞螟蛉子</h3>
<p>從販賣人口的角度看，香港是一個有名的「猪仔埠」，戰前每年有成千成萬的勞工，被賣作「猪仔」，運往南洋英屬或荷屬的島嶼，担任墾荒或鑛塲的工作。戰後這個海外銷塲，一時未能恢復，人口販子的生意眼便轉移到另一方面，居然又發現了「新大陸」。</p>
<p>最近，本港有些家庭的孩子，突然宣佈失蹤。爲家長的四出尋覓，都無下落——原來，孩子都已被拐去了。聽說那些幹拐賣人口勾當的人，組縱很完密。他們一面和「市塲」的客人接洽「貨物」，一面派人出人港澳和廣州各地，設法誘拐「適合條件」的孩子。擬記者探悉：一個七八齡的小孩，聰明而而目端正的，男女不拘，每個最初値國幣七八十萬，最近增至一百萬以上。</p>
<p>那些拐賣人口的機關，聽說總機關設在澳門，担任工作者大半是女流。她們裝束入時，儼然是富貴人家出身，以圖掩飾他人的耳目。她們狡　地利用一般傭婦，作誘拐小孩的綫索。在省港方面拐得的孩子，必先運往澳門，就近送往「市塲」去。</p>
<p>那個人口市塲「新大陸」的形成，說來是一篇傷心的故事：</p>
<p>被拐的孩子，大半被賣給廣東台山開平等縣（俗稱四邑）的華僑眷屬。據最近由四吧來港的客人談稱：四邑近年來經過日軍的蹂躪和兩度饑荒，人口銳减，已達到可怕的程度。四邑爲美洲華僑的故鄕，戰後僑匯暢通，僑胞亦大批返國。他們離鄉十年，一旦歸來，大多廬舍蕩然，家人死亡離散，恍如隔世。即田園幸得保全者，亦覺形影孤單，不勝冷落。他們爲了安慰年老的寂寞心情，過去已有收買螟蛉子的風氣，而今更爲迫切。販賣人口的，看中了一般基僑的需要，市塲日見隆盛了。</p>
<p>華僑囊中多金，間有急於振興家門，買子娶媳，於是十六七歲的少女，也成了拐匪的對象。無知者墮其彀中，亦不乏人。</p>
<p>香港和廣州的小孩，所遭受拐匪的威脅，比上海小孩的「剝田鷄」不知要厲害多少倍！失去兒女的人家，應該責怪那些不顧人道的拐匪，抑歸咎於那些年老還鄕滿懷悽悲的華僑呢？</p>

<h3>美蘇在朝鮮　角逐日趨白熱化</h3>
<p>— —本報編譯室特譯稿—佐溪節譯自星期六晚報</p>
<p>美國最危險的一條界綫是通過朝鮮中部北緯三十八度的那條界綫。這條界綫蘇聯人異常重視，我們美國人却漠然視之，但是無疑地這條界綫是劃在兩個互相猜忌的國家之間，小小誤會儘可以變成戰爭的導火綫，這條界綫離開我們的太平洋海岸雖然很遠，美國軍事領袖認爲它對於我們的安全關係重大，但是一般美國人還沒有體認到它的重要性。</p>
<p>在戰前遠東方面沒有一個充分强大的國家能够完全控制遠東。日本雖野心勃勃，但有蘇聯顧忌，同時中國尚保有鉅大的自衛力量。日本戰敗以後，遠東的均勢已全部失墜，同時聯合國並無發展任何新勢力以代替此項均勢的迹象。這一個空隙遂被來自相反方向的新勢力所塡補：美國的勢力從海面而來，具有海面交通的優勢和弱點；蘇聊的勢力從陸地而來，具有接壤的優點，和遠隔的弱點。兩種勢力就在朝鮮相會合。這一條北緯三十八度的界綫不單是兩個盟邦的便利的分界綫，它是兩個政策根本相反的國家間的邊界綫。</p>
<p>不能妥協</p>
<p>朝鮮是美蘇兩國單獨對峙的唯一的國家。許多人以爲沒有英國人或法國人涉足其間，我們和蘇聯的關係可以比較好些現在却大失所望了。朝鮮已變成美蘇戰後關係的試騐塲所，而所能得到的結論是異常黯淡。美國人至今不能和蘇聯人獲致妥協，以保護我們的利益。朝鮮同時也是蘇聯談判方式和第五縱隊活躍的一個最好的例子。</p>
<p>爲明膫美蘇兩國在朝鮮所處的地位，請看亞洲東北部地岡，你就可以看出朝鮮突出在中國東北和華北的前面。蘇聯雖已從東北的南部和中部退出，讓國共雙方在那裏進行內戰，可是蘇聯並沒有放鬆東北南部的遼東半島，此地距離朝鮮不遠，是旅順大連的所在地。朝鮮東北部和蘇聯西伯利亞項背相接，如果那裏築有好的公路，從海參威乘汽車到此不過兩小時。假定蘇聯佔有朝鮮的全部飛機場，他們可以控制東北，華北和上海以北的中國沿海區域。地們可以不顧美國駐在日本的佔領軍，與日本以一種壓力。在另一方面，朝鮮南部的美國湝勢力亦可以壓迫大連，壓迫海參威，壓迫更遠的地方，這是蘇聯人心目中的朝鮮的地理形勢，它說明了蘇聯在這一區域裏的大部份的活動、</p>
<p>蘇聯的信條是：在資本主義國家中，革命和內戰是不可避免的，同樣炎本主義國家和蘇聯之閒的戰爭也是不可避免的。目前最强大的資本主義國家當然是美國，蘇聯覺得美蘇間的戰爭是遲早要發生的。蘇聯在朝鮮所推行的計劃，是從地理上的概念。同時也從這種信念出發的。</p>
<p>在我們美國方面，戰略上的需要是跟蘇聯同樣明顯的。過去有一個强大的敵對的海軍國家控制着東亞海岸，我們已經够受了。但是把日本的控制和威脅剷除而代以蘇聯的控制和威脅，對於美國並沒有好處。朝鮮一旦落入蘇聯的掌握，同時蘇聯的勢力侵人華北和華中以後、不久就可以產生一個强大的帝俄、它的幅員從極北的海岸一直伸展到揚子江，可以發展爲將來對美作戰的軍事根據地。因此我們要維持美國在朝鮮的界綫，我們雖願意讓步或妥協，但不願接受蘇聯要求統治朝鮮的條件。</p>
<p>蘇聯駐軍</p>
<p>蘇聯駐軍的司令部設於朝鮮第二大都市平壤，這裏有良好的鐵路交通綫通至東部海岸各港口，由此從海路直達海參威之間已經有直接的陸路交通了。</p>
<p>駐在朝鮮北部的蘇聯軍隊的在二十二萬至二十五萬人之間，這數目比較美國駐在日本和朝鮮兩地的佔領軍的總數還大得多，和司令部設在漢城的霍奇中將所統率的軍隊比較起來，誠如大巫與小巫了。蘇聯的駐軍不特數量大，而且都是精銳的部隊。在界綫的兩邊，美國駐有一分隊，蘇聯則駐有一中隊或一大隊，美國的一分隊由毫無經騐的伍長統率，而蘇聯的一中隊則由訓練成熟的上尉率領。處處顯示蘇聯有意爭取軍事上的優勢。駐在朝鮮的蘇聯軍隊並不以爲他們的任務是維持朝鮮的秩序，而是繼續對法西斯及暴政奮鬥。他們認爲美國駐軍是阻止他完成此種任務的唯一的陣碍。</p>
<p>美蘇兩國駐軍的相反的政策在界綫的附近最爲明顯，此一死區使朝鮮的經濟和政治生活不能恢復常態、這種人爲的障碍甚至連日本人也始料所未及。以前居民車輛和貨物都可以自由移動，現在一切合法的行動却都要受到阻礙了。美國方面的巡察比較寬和，但是蘇聯方面的防範却十分嚴密。大概能在界綫南北自由通行的朝鮮人是得到蘇方的許可的。</p>
<p>蘇方的駐軍緊貼在界綫上，美方則在若干地點故意退避三舍，以免發生正面衝突。蘇軍有時候很友善，很和藹可親，有時候却變得很嚴肅而多疑。美軍永遠不能捉摸對方的眞正態度。</p>
<p>蘇聯在朝鮮北部實行一種警管制，自十七歲至六十歲的朝鮮男子都須携帶公民證朝鮮人民欲獲得此項公民證必先宣誓擁護蘇軍司令官和有關朝鮮的莫斯科決議，否則以罪犯看特。凡是沒有警局通行證的朝鮮人民，即使在朝鮮北部也不能自由行動。每一城鎭中都陳列着巨幅的史達林。列寗·馬克斯等的照像，和其他各種宣傳品，使人們一見便想到這裏是蘇聯的一個分區。</p>
<p>實行赤化</p>
<p>朝鮮北部的政黨，除共產黨外，均被禁止活動，同時該處的朝鮮人不准收聽美國佔領區的無綫電播音。所有工商業均被蘇聯人所獨佔。面積超過十二英畝半的耕地概被沒收，分配給沒有耕地的朝鮮人。這種土地分配法使蘇聯人獲得新產生的小地主階級的擁護。</p>
<p>蘇聯不僅把朝鮮北部實行赤化，同時更處心積慮把共產勢力伸入朝鮮南部。到相當時候蘇聯將建議美蘇駐軍同時退出朝鮮。在美軍退出朝鮮以後，朝鮮共產黨便可大事活躍，同時受過共產訓練的朝鮮軍隊可以藉端生事，奪佔重要機關，在短時期內，共產黨可以究全控制朝鮮政府和朝鮮半鳥，而蘇聯則在背後策動，以推行它的政治和軍事計劃。</p>
<p>但據最近報吿，朝鮮南部的共產黨發生內鬨，同時朝鮮北部亦曾發生騷擾情事。大概朝鮮北部居民對於共產黨的怨望是不可掩飾的事實。蘇聯當局雖在那裏駐有大軍，不免感到惴惴不安？反之，駐在朝鮮南部的美軍至今還沒有和那裏的朝鮮人民發生過任何軋　。</p>
<p>但是蘇聯對於朝鮮人民的關係雖不及我們的良好，他們的地位究竟比我們的佔着優勢。照着這種情勢演變下去，我們難以想像蘇聯不會得到最後的勝利。</p>
<p>朝鮮境內緯三十八度美蘇佔領區劃界處，圓屋屬於美軍，木屋屬於蘇軍。</p>
<p>新聞辭典</p>
<h3>「阿拉斯加」與「阿留申羣島」</h3>
<p>— 佐祺</p>
<p>據聯合社珍珠港十月三日電：美國太平洋艦隊司令陶爾士招待記者稱，美國海軍現計劃在阿留申羣島及阿拉斯加等地，建造永久性的海軍基地。美國此種政策，係因最近國際局勢時緊時弛，爲防止遭受外來意外襲擊的措施。</p>
<p>阿拉斯加（Alaska）位於北美洲的西北隅，東界坎拿大，西面與蘇聯的西伯利亞僅隔一白令海峽。此地本屬俄國、公元一八六七年，美國以七查廿萬美元向俄國購入、遂屬於美。阿拉斯加南北濱太平，北冰兩洋，北岸徑直，但太平洋岸與白令海岸，則海灣深入，島嶼林立，阿拉斯加半島向西南伸出，與阿留申羣島（Aleutian）若斷若續、成一冗長的帶形，爲今日美國北極闔防的第一綫。</p>
<p>阿拉斯加的鐵路總長在一千四百公十里以上、鹿犬都能駕撬，增加交通便利不少。</p>
<p>阿留申羣島中的荷蘭港（Dutch　Harbor），爲美國重要海軍基地，號稱「太北平洋的新加坡」。</p>
<h3>美蘇間的鴻溝</h3>
<p>— 儲玉坤</p>
<p>兩國分道揚鏕各自戒備</p>
<p>這一星期的國際局勢，仍呈着外弛內張前情形；在政治外交家甚至軍事領袖的口頭，雖然還是說着「戰爭不致再起一類的話，」但是各國從戒備，仍是有增無减；尤其是美蘇兩國。自新任商務部長哈里曼官誓就職後，美國的對蘇政策。很明顯的，已放棄了故總統羅斯福的路綫。他說：『史達林元帥及蘇聯其他領袖，深信資本主義與共產主義，不能同時存在同一世界，故傾其全力，阻制英美對於解決世界政治問題所作之種種努力。故總統羅斯福雖亦相信美蘇制度不同，但認爲有和平相處的可能；羅斯福今日倘若猶在人間，必將推行杜魯門總統與貝爾納斯國務卿二人所採取之政策。」</p>
<p>此在蘇聯方面，美國「自由乃余所選擇』作者克拉夫慶哥在「世界新聞」發表一文竟稱史達林不但相信世界已受「新的戰爭」之威脅，而且還儘力準備這一個新的戰爭，同時又據路透社駐莫斯科記者唐果返國報吿蘇聯軍事改革的情形，（一）正編陸軍，增強其流動性及獨立性，並研究原子能的効能。（二）擴充海空兩軍，聞蘇聯已有最新式的轟炸機及戰鬥機；海軍基地，也在擴充中；（三）蘇聯軍隊澈底黨化，並提高軍紀，以絕對服從爲口號。蘇聯改革軍事的目的，乃在適應現代化戰爭。所以在美蘇兩國分道揚鏕各自備戰的情形之下，一切和平商談不啻是對於目下時局的一個諷刺。</p>
<p>巴黎和會　如期結束</p>
<p>各國代表在巴黎和會中的意見，雖然仍極紛歧，沒有趨於一致的希望，尤其是對於若干重要問題，斯拉夫集團與英美集團，仍是南轅北轍；但是巴黎和會已定於本月十五日宣吿結束，是不能再延宕的。和會開了二個多月，各國代表在巴黎玩也玩得發膩了，對於開會討論，早已發生厭倦，莫不希望和會早日結束，到紐約去換一換空氣。因此對義羅匈保芬五國的和的草案，都沒有遭遇到何種重大困難，而經和會全體大會通過了。最後一次大會的主席，本來輪到中國代表團團長郭泰祺，但是法國代表團要求由法國主持，以盡地主之誼，中國也就欣然接受了、</p>
<p>廿一國和會聞七月二十八日開幕以來，至十月十五日宣吿結束。共間歷整整的兩個月又十八日，是人類歷史上最悠久的和平會議；雖然通過了五抓和的草案，但是有關世界政治的重要問題，都沒有獲致解決辦法。使我們不能不承認締造世界和平的艱難</p>
<p>海峽問題　英美一致</p>
<p>關於土耳其的海峽問題，蘇聯會兩次照會土耳其政府，要求蘇土兩國共同防衛韃靼尼爾海峽，英美能度如何？常爲世人所注意。美國雖然反對蘇土聯防海峽的計劃，但是對蘇聯在海峽地帶的合法權利，也願加以考慮。美國駐蘇大使史密斯於九日照會蘇聯，重言聲明，美國爲有關土耳其海峽之一國，關於蒙特婁公約之任何修正，美國理應參與其事。並謂英美蘇三國前在波茨坦會議時，曾一致同意海峽地位有修改的必要，但修正的方法，應依照蒙特婁公的之規定。蘇聯所稱海峽地位僅與土國暨黑海各國有關一節，美國礙難同意。土耳其仍獨常保衛海峽之重任。他日海峽若遭受直接或間接威脅時，土國儘可向聯合國安全理事會申訴。</p>
<p>英美的態度旣然如此明朗，土國當可有恃無恐，至於蘇聯的反響如何？要看她對土耳其將採取何種外交攻勢而定了。</p>
<p>法國投票　表決憲章</p>
<p>法國的政治制度，自從獲得解放迄今，還是一種臨時政府的性質，法國元首比杜爾，迄今還稱爲臨時總統兼內閣總理。國民制憲會雖在本年四五月間，起草了一部憲法草案，於本年五月五日付諸公民投票表決，結果是被否決了。國民制憲會議的前功盡棄。另外舉行普選，重新起草憲法。法國的三大政黨（即天主敎進步黨，社會黨暨共產黨）的領袖，曾盡一切妥協的能事，務使法國於最短期內，完成一部最民主的憲法、而使臨時政體得以早日束。</p>
<p>這是公民投票表決憲草，本來是絕無問題的，但是戴高樂將軍却在公民投票之前，先後發表了二次演說，表示反對這部憲法草案，不免有一部份的選民，允其是天主敎進步黨的黨員，不免受他的影響，而改投反對票。所以法國憲法草案所獲得的多數，實在相差無幾，這也足以說明法國內政的複雜，今後的問題，仍是方興未艾。十月十五日</p>
<h3>共產主義　向日本人進攻　密謀推翻保守內閣</h3>
<p>日本的佔領機構是完全由美國控制的。由於美國阻止蘇聯利用佔領機構推行其政策的原故，蘇方現在已經開始採取迂廻曲折的方法，來促使日本人民傾向共產主義。西比利亞許多廣播電台所播送的宣傳新聞，目的是在鼓勵日本人反對保守政黨的政府，並且使日本大衆對佔領軍司令部失却信心。</p>
<p>蘇聯當前的目標，就是要推翻目前治理日本的保守內閣。最後，她希望日本這個國家變成親共而傾向蘇聯。蘇方相信美國芷在日本建立一個反共和反動的政府，並且懷疑美國有將日本變成其前進基地的意圖。</p>
<p>美國堅決反對日本的共產主義，主張培植一個保守而對西方國家友好的政權。民主憲法予以實施，在佔領期閒，日本人民將受民主政治的訓練。</p>
<p>佔領當局正用一個保守派的內閣治理國家。盟軍總部希望這個內閣　績行駛職　，以待新憲法在議會中獲得通過。</p>
<p>職是之故，盟軍總部反對激進活動的政策，日趨強硬。麥帥</p>
<p>曾親自發出警吿，禁止羣衆示威反對內閣，日本政府已獲准去限制日本勞工聯盟的活動，因爲這些團體大多數是有社會主義色彩的。</p>
<p>蘇聯的廣播一方面主張推翻現行內閣，另一方面則敦促日本國內的反對勢力團結起來。操日本語極流利的蘇聯廣播員指吉田首相及其閣負爲反動份子。來自西比利亞的呼聲勸導日本支持民主政治者組織民主陣綫，並爲驅逐「這輩戰爭罪犯而鬥爭」。</p>
<p>在此時推翻日本內閣可以增加反對黨的力量。目下日本缺乏糧食，失業者達五百萬人，通貨膨脹甚烈，又缺少房屋，沒有一個政府可以克服這些困難。但是這種經濟情形當熱會引起民衆對執政政府的不滿，因此對支持吉田內閣的兩個保守政黨採取反對態度的勢力，正在滋畏起來。</p>
<h3>失業增加　反政府在滋長</h3>
<p>日本報紙舉行的民意測騐，認爲假如現在舉行選舉，結果反對黨的勢力將大增，尤其是社會民主黨，因爲該黨是有勞工支特的。目下社會民主黨在議會中佔有五分之一的席位。假如在選舉中獲得更大的收穫，就可以和共產黨以及獨立份子在議會中佔有大多數而出組政府。</p>
<p>蘇聯宣傳的目的是在推翻吉田內閣，並且迫使日本舉行選舉希望非保守政黨可以因此抬頭。</p>
<p>蘇聯廣播員攻聲佔領軍司令部的基本政策，措詞激烈，他們說麥帥總部所支持的日本新憲法是一種騙人的文件，目的無非想保留日皇，其中輕視小民的權利，使內閣和議會聽命於日皇，事實上和以前的憲法並沒有多大的不同。</p>
<p>蘇聯認爲日皇是戰犯、反對日本保持皇制，就是使他成爲一個毫無權力的象徵的東西也不贊成，因爲他是導使日本人民進行制霸世界的中心。</p>
<h3>對於麥帥　日人表示信心</h3>
<p>— 南譯自世界週報</p>
<p>據蘇聯方面的意見，日本的土地改革正遭佔領軍司令部的阻撓，麥帥總部的官吏袒護日本反動份子，阻止土地的再分配。</p>
<p>麥帥本人也是蘇方攻繫的目標，說他侵犯遠東委員會的權力以及未能與盟國對日管制委員會合作。代表十一個國家的遠東委員會是決定對日基本政策的。而盟國對日管制委員會的任務是向佔領軍總司令提供意見。蘇聯廣播員說：美國佔領當局未能和這兩個委員會和諧合作，因此有意無意間正在帮助日本戰爭領袖去逃避履行投降條件。</p>
<p>但是蘇聯的廣播宣傳不見得會達到目的，雖然對於將來推翻日本內閣可能發生若干影響。</p>
<p>一般地講，目本人對於麥帥的佔領工作似乎頗爲滿意，因爲一切沒有像投降時所想像的那樣嚴厲。一年以來，麥帥在日本大衆巾頗負聲準，地位極爲鞏固。大多數日本人仍舊怕懼共產主義，對於共產黨所主張的惟翻日皇制度，尤其反對。</p>
<p>美國國務院決心防止日本佔領工作分劃開來猶如　國和　國那樣的。所以美國政府將繼績給予麥帥充份的支持。</p>
<p>佔領日本的機構，基礎非常堅固，國外來的宣傳是無法使其動搖的。</p>

<h3>歐陽修與朱淑貞之「生查子」案</h3>
<p>— 孫約翰</p>
<p>歐陽修是北宋的大文學家，朱淑貞是南宋的女詩人，他們身後都有詩詞集遺留在人間；幷且他們兩人的詩詞集中，都有一首生查子詞。那生查子詞是：「去年元夜時，花市燈如畫。月上柳梢頭，人的黃昏後。今年元夕夜，月與燈依舊；不見去年人，淚濕春衫袖」！因爲他們兩人的詩集中，不的而同的有這一首詞，於是使後之讀者，讀到這首詞時，起了無數疑團。經渦許多考據家及詞章家的爭論與佐證，依舊玉石未分，　黃莫辨；至多是此亦一是非，彼亦一是非，沒有充分的理由，好在中國文士素來喜歡馬馬虎虎，喜歡墨守傳統，以爲與其不能解決，寗使含糊着罷。於是道案子似乎直到如今還沒有得到眞正確切的審劾與判斷。我旣沒有賞鑑家的目光，也乏考據家的資力，只是平時對於僻句古典頗喜探討參看，遇一疑間，往往搜查得廢食忘寢，直至水落石出而後已。不知何時偶憶起這案子，經一讀朱淑貞斷腸詩詞集，與歐陽修詩詞集之下，頓時發覺這生查子詞確爲朱淑貞所作。讀者對於歐陽修的身世閱歷及生平軼事，想多明白，不須贅述。現在就把朱淑貞來的略的介紹一下，一則可證實我的見解，二則更可使這深處幽閑鬱鬱不得志的一代女作家，再到近世來露一下頭而。</p>
<p>朱淑貞是浙江海寗人，與朱熹差不多時候，又據說是朱熹的姪女，這有些不確、因爲以出生地址來說：朱熹是新安人。譜中並無兄弟遷居海寗者。朱淑貞童稚之年，早已天姿秀發，艷　嬌嬈，喜歡讀書。當她荳蔲梢頭的芳齡，對於詩詞允所愛好，曾作過一首詩過：「初合雙鬢學畫眉，未知心事屬他誰？待將滿抱中秋月，分別蕭郞萬首詩」。從這詩中可看出她那時已有非常風流瀟洒的心事與抱負。她希望嫁得個能詩能文，溫文爾雅的才子，在閏房中可以互相酬答，以盡侶隨之樂趣。那知早歲父母不慎，且深中舊禮敎婚姻制度的毒。乃與市井平凡民家訂了婚，以致下嫁得一不知詩書的庸夫，吟詩作對不用說是恍如對半彈琴。雖不常常反目，但她竟因此抑鬱憂傷，終以抱恚而死。詩詞巾到處有不如意的口氣，最顯著是愁懷一首道：「鷗鷺鴛鴦作一池，須知羽翼不相宜；東君不與花爲主，何似休生連理枝」！她自己怨恨所適非人，在給她父母的詩中也有「詩禮聞相遠，琴樽誰是親？愁看羅袖上，長揾淚痕新」。讀這四句詩，就可知道她從小和父母在家中對於詩詞琴樽是撫弄慣了的。然而一到夫家，再沒有這種她所愛好的伴侶了！於是她感到生活的蕭條，夫婿的庸碌。傷心之處，惟有以淚洗面，羅袖上滿是淚痕了！她自己秋日述懷詩也道：「婦人雖軟眼，淚不等閒流，我因無好况，揮斷五湖秋」。有心人讀之。恐不能不爲之淚下。</p>
<p>所以她每當花晨月夕月下燈前，或對月臨風，信筆寫她一己的心情與意緒，以聊舒她的鬰結，她所作的詩詞中，大的不外乎哀，怨，嘆，恨，悲，愁，傷，嗟，病和淚。總括這些東西，都够使她斷腸，而千篇一律的便是個「獨」字，集中差不多沒有一篇不含孤獨的成分，如。「獨坐小牎無伴侶，凝悄羞對海棠花」。「偏宜小閣幽牎下；獨自燒香獨自眠」。「獨坐小　無伴侶，可憐霜月向人圓」。「此時悄緒誰能會？獨坐中庭夜已深」。「獨自憑欄無箇事，水風凉處讀文書」。「牎下孤燈自明減，無聊獨自懶局門」，「夜深無伴倚空樓」。「四簷飛急雨，寂寂坐空齋」。「徘徊月影下，欲去又依然」。「幾許舊時事，令宵誰與同」？「我將好况供陪夢，只恐燈花不奈寒」！等等，不勝摘錄，詩詞中流淚的地方也不少，如：「悶懷脈脈與誰說？淚滴羅衣不忍看」，「桃花臉上汪在淚，愁到史深枕上流」。「燈花占斷燒心事，羅袖長供把淚痕」。「冷懷倚枕入無寐，鐵石心腸也淚流」。「鴛幃夢轉展，珠淚向誰彈」？「夕陽樓上坐，獨倚淚偸流」等。</p>
<p>她的境况旣如此凄愴，夫婿又不能如意；每逢美景良辰，不無虛設之慨。如：「盡日倚牎悄脈脈，眼前無事奈春何」？「池塘水暖鶼鶼至，巷陌風輕燕燕飛」。「人間無處無春色，祗是團圓人未歸」。「鶯花有恨偏供我，桃李無言祗惱人」。「間關幾許傷懷處，悒悒柔情不自持」。「良辰美景俱成恨，莫問新年與舊年」。其怨恨可知。生查子詞便在這種情况下做成的，其中「月上柳稍頭，人的黃昏後」兩句，有人認爲朱淑貞有桑濮之行，這「的」字是與男朋友有私事。有人認爲這「的」字是指她的女伴而言。若說朱淑貞眞有男朋友的話，她的詩卷會給父母所燒燬過，所傳者百不存一；已是片羽一斑，難窺全豹了。但她現在存在的詩詞中，已經很流露出她的隱悄。如寄情道：「欲寄相思滿紙愁，魚沉雁查又還休，分明此去無多地，如在天涯無盡頭」。無寐云「吹微雲　蕭夜未賒，梨花帶月映牎紗，休將姓氏思量偏，激　新愁亂如麻」。其二云「背彈珠淚晴傷神，挑盡寒燈睡不成，卸却鳳釵尋夢去，上床開眼到天明」。紅城子詞云：「斜風細雨作春寒。對樽前憶前歡；曾把梨花寂寞淚闌干，芳草斷烟南浦路。和別淚，看靑山，昨宵徒得夢因緣，水雲閒，悄無言，爭奈醒來愁恨又依然。展轉衾裯空懊惱，天易見，見伊難」。寄別中有云：「吟箋謾有千篇恨，心事全無一點通」。元夜三首之一云：「火燭銀花觸目紅，揭天鼓吹鬧春風，新歡入手愁忙裏，舊事驚心憶夢中。但願暫成人繾綣，不妨常任月朦朧；賞燈那得工夫醉，未必明年此會同」。又有「歸來禁漏踰三四，牎上梅花瘦影橫」兩句。可見朱淑貞在那元夜裏，看燈直至更深夜蘭，月至中天方歸。則生查子詞中所言，確有此事，無可避諱了。說不定那詞是在這年歡會的下一年元夜時作的。若說這『約』字是指女伴，則集中有的遊春不去二首云「鄰姬約我踏靑遊，强拂愁眉下小樓，去戶欲行還自省，也知憔悴見人羞」。「少年意思懶能酬，愛好心情一向休，若到舊家游冶處，只應滿眼是春愁」。旣與女伴的遊春，則與女伴的賞月亦未始不可。所以不論男朋友女朋友，這約會在朱淑貞是的確有其事實的。</p>
<p>講到歐陽修，他是進士出身，曾歷任諫官，參知政事，翰林侍讀學士，樞密副使，靑州從事，滁州通判，及太子少師等職。號醉翁，晚又自稱六一居士，謚文忠公。平時詩酒朋友的往來，定然門庭若市，熱鬧非凡，更不必說元夜了。豈有當金城不禁火樹銀花之時，獨自徘徊月下感嘆悲哀而至於淚下　　之理？所以這首詞放進歐集中去，似乎有些不配。因爲男性的相思與懷舊是決不會哭泣的。</p>
<p>歐陽修曾作詞云：「江南柳，葉小未成蔭，人爲絲輕那忍折？鶯憐枝嫩不勝吟，留取待春深。十四五，閒抱琵琶尋，堂上　錢堂下走，恁時相見已關心，何况到如今」？這詞做成後，就有許多學者的議誚和批駁，認爲是艷情之曲；像歐陽修顯宦的身份，根本不允許作情詞，一有偸香竊玉的成分，就能减損他的令譽。而他自己作這首詞後也引爲是終身之累。但生查子詞與皺詞一比較，其艷悄似覺有甚於此詞者。會　樂府雅詞序云：「歐公」代儒宗，風流自命，乃小人或作艷詞，謬爲公曲」。名臣錄亦云：「修知貢舉，爲下第舉子劉惲等所忌，以醉蓬萊望江南等詞誣之」。可見後人編歐陽修詩詞集時，把別人作品編進去的很多，這生查子詞，未始不是編時所誤。</p>
<p>歐陽修在夜間獨自所作的詩詞頗少，而朱淑貞却多半是在有月的夜裏，獨自無聊時吟成的。以詞中「黃昏」兩字言斷腸詩詞集中數見不鮮，如：「如梨花細雨黃昏後」。「愁到黃昏轉更加」。」怕黃昏後到昏黃」。「黃昏却下瀟瀟雨」。「纖纖新月掛黃昏」。「水亭相對已黃昏」。「黃昏楊柳舊風光」。「浮雲盡逐黃昏去」。「砌下黃昏微雨後」。「獨倚欄干黃昏後」等。</p>
<p>總之，從各方面比較推測和判斷之下，確實證明生查子詞是屬於朱淑貞所作。因爲道詞中境地，情况，身世和語氣，均與歐陽修不侔，而與朱淑貞相脗合。</p>

<h3>星火</h3>
<p>— 田肅</p>
<p>我愛星火，雖然，星火只是是那麼的微小。</p>
<p>但朋友，我們可不該小視了這微細的星火，微細的星火，正是世界上最偉大的力的發韌！</p>
<p>有了火，就有了光，就有了熱，就有了力，幾千萬的由星火而產生的微力，從幾千萬個角落裏匯集攏來，一是一股巨大的洪流？它會摧毀一切堅强頑固的阻檔，而流遍了地球的每一個凹凸面。</p>
<p>讓我來講述一個我們孩提時候的故事。</p>
<p>那是一個初冬的黃昏，我們在離城很遠的荒地上，一味的貪玩，使我們忘却了歸路，是的，我們迷失了路途，而天却黑了下來，空中佈滿着陰雲，月和星子，都被呑沒在烏黑裏，耳邊刮着尖銳的夜風，夾帶着鷗鵠凄厲的慘呌·枯樹·荒田·墳墓，……四周是那末陰森，在黑暗的重重包圍中，我們看不見自己的影子，我們都急了，心讓恐怖籠罩着，我們都想哭。突然：</p>
<p>「你看，前面不是有着火嗎！」</p>
<p>我們的一個伙伴，他喜悅的呌了起來，我們抬頭向前邊望去，啊！前邊正閃　着一點微細的星火，雖然是一點微細的星火，但橫亘在我們面前的，已不再是黑暗！我們的心復活了，我們得到了新的活力，我們的眼中燃燒着希冀的光芒，我們向着這點星火衝去。</p>
<p>漸漸的，這點微細的星火，變成了龐大的光亮，它照耀在我們的眼前，像母親溫柔的手掌，輕撫着我們的身子。我們獲得了村莊，我們獲得了同情，我們獲得了溫暖，我們都欣慰的笑着，我們重又得到了光明！</p>
<p>柯洛連科說得好：「這種夜火，具有這樣的特性，是戰勝黑暗，是接近我們，是閃閃發光」。是的，火是一切安慰娛樂人類的東西的泉源！</p>
<p>而希臘神話中的普洛米修士，爲了地面上人類生活的不知改進，乃偸偸的偷了一星星的火種給人間，于是地面上的人類，便更活躍了起來。而普洛米修士，也因此被縛在史克西亞的荒岩上，受苦了不知多少年。</p>
<p>雖然，星火只是微小的一點力效。</p>
<p>但朋友，你又可曾聽到。「星星之火，可以燎原」？</p>
<p>讓一點微細的星火，閃耀在黑夜的荒原上！</p>

<p>一位走運的劇作者，當他的劇本常在通都大埠的舞台上演時，他的版稅，上演稅，如果劇塲經紀人和書店老　們不揩油的話，自然是麥克麥克的。有些寫慣小說的作者也眼紅而按　，試用着小說的技巧開始劇本的習作；但成功的極少。原因就在缺少『戲劇性』。英國小說作者康拉特，曾經化了九牛二虎之力，把他的名作「秘密代表」改編爲劇本，拿去請敎劇作家高爾斯華綏。高氏自信在友誼上有把握，可以說幾句老實話，便從這劇本的內容與形式，純持客觀的態度，指出許許多多的缺點，希望他改正。康拉特當面首肯，表示十二分的同意；，可是，他因爲改編劇本時，吃過大苦，總覺得演出的成功，有絕對的可能。他默默地想：「你不要老氣橫秋地批評我，祇要搬到舞台上去，定能奪取你的前席。」終於拒絕他的批評，一字未改。誰知在上演時，果然枯燥沉悶，不爲觀衆所歡迎，就是存心來捧塲的朋友，都不能不微微嘆息，交頭接耳說：「這簡直不像劇本，是分幕的小說。」</p>
<p>康拉特的慘敗，就在誤信一切的文藝形式，都可以迷用差不多的技巧，來達到表現的效果。殊不知小說與戲劇，雖多類似之處；但仍有不同的區別在。人們要嘗試不熟悉的文藝形式，旣不能根究牠特有的技巧，又不肯虛心接納專家們善意的忠吿，無疑，他們嘗試的結果，一定是慘敗的！</p>
<p>小說與戲劇，都是叙述故事的，都有人物的介紹，環境與時間的說明；不過，現代的小說，應該盡量運用作劇的方法，讓人物自己來說明，從動作上刻劃人物的個性，非到萬不得已時，決不濫寫無味的對話，更須懂得電影裏常用的「蒙太琪」的手法，經濟而扼要地寫出故事中的人地時，要絕對避免多餘的叙述。尤其是當人物之出規於小說中時，像過去平面的舖張，誰都覺得不若戲劇中立體化的生動與活躍。現代的小說作者，必須談寫在紙面的人物，也能如人物之出現於舞台似的立體化，已是小說作者不能不擅長的手法了。要不然小說的戲劇性，必然是極端貧乏的。小說而缺少戲劇性，和那些平淡無奇的新聞報道何以異？</p>
<p>有些小說作者，像康拉特，亨利詹姆斯，喬治摩爾，雖能寫較好的小說，但作品缺乏戲劇性；所以他們試寫的劇本，是讀劇，一經上演，無有不失敗。然茶花女的作者小仲馬，死靈魂的作者哥戈里，同樣能寫出較好的劇本，正因爲他們在寫小說時，能够運甩作劇的方法，使作品富於戲劇性的緣故。這就是說，不能使小說富於戲劇性的作者，決不能寫劇本，不能運用作劇的方法來寫小說，亦斷乎不能寫出戲劇性的小說。戲劇的作者，可以無須懂得寫小說的方法，但小設作者應該多讀名劇，常看各劇的演出，悉心體騐作劇的技巧。</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血　　64</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>車行不到十里，我們已經遇到兩次麻煩，這時要悔亦來不及，只能加意提防了。這車走得很慢，路軌不平，搖晃得厲害。我同虎弟，一夜通宵未曾休息，這時肚內多了些飲食，車中汗氣鬰蒸，加上天氣沉悶，再經車子一搖晃不覺十分瞌睡。看看虎弟已經垂頭睡熟，我只好依住車壁，努力撑起眼皮，眺望窗外的田野來解困。</p>
<p>這樣不知經過了多少時間，我想至多也不過十分八分鐘吧，猛然聽得虎弟一聲高唱，「嘿—怎麼哪」？吆喝聲中，還夾着「怕」的一響，這祗是一剎的事，等我驚得回轉頭來，虎弟已經跳了起來，又是「撥湯」一聲，祇見一個車上茶伕，手捧着臉，口角滴下血來，一把開水瓷罐，碎在地上，水濺到近邊好些人身上。</p>
<p>虎弟還要上前，我忙喊着止住。一問原來那茶夫存心把一罐開水，洒了些在虎弟腿上。</p>
<p>這時車上立刻鼎沸起來，滿是一片輿論：「這孩子手上有活，一巴掌給打掉兩顆板牙…人家又不是存心澆他的水哩，……啊，揍啊……皺是當奸細的野雜種，敢動手打人，……住他，別讓他溜了腿……」正鬧着，前後車門一擁而進，來了好些人，有的是車上號衣，茶伕，還有兩三名押車巡警，好像約會了的似的。</p>
<p>我背依車窗站着，冷眼瞧着變化。那挨打的茶伕，見有人來，便一作勢，猛向虎弟這裏撲來，舉手一拳，虎弟哈哈一笑，隨手一撈，把那傢伙的手臂擒住一擰，那們大一個漢子，立刻跪了下去，只嚷痛。就在這一展眼當口，我們對座那個商人打扮的東西，站了起來，離開座位，一指虎弟，對那些進來的人喝着，「逮他下去！」</p>
<p>這一來，事態可明顯了，知道這原是做就的一個局面。那商人打扮的，毫無疑義，必是只人的特工爪牙，上車來故意坐在我們對座，設法要偵查我們來路行徑。看見軟騙手段，虎弟竟不吃那一套，所以才有這潑翻開水的戲法，也許原來計劃，並不如此，因沒知道虎弟手脚厲害，所以演進上起了變化，假使他們預先知道虎弟這等厲害，也許手段更加惡毒哩。</p>
<p>「車上無故揍人？—憑什麼勢頭？—」巡警已經逼上前來。</p>
<p>「你們是路局的巡警嗎？……這事得我來解說。」我怕虎弟鬧得太兇，不好下塲，把他拉在身後。那挨擰的茶伕抱住手骼臂，站在當前，滴的歪着勃子。</p>
<p>「你們是一路的？」一個疤眼厚嘴唇的巡警問我，裝着日本人說中國話的那副腔調。</p>
<p>「對哪，他是我的外甥，我是他的小姨；大概是一路的吧。」我淡淡的答復他。</p>
<p>「憑什麼揍人？他有錯就該上我那兒分說分說，你知道這裏是有『王法』的嗎？」這疤眼傢伙瞪起眼睛來。</p>
<p>聽了他這個口氣，大概凡是中華民國的人，就應該生氣。我本來也預備敎訓這傢伙一頓，但一想到我們一身的重要使命，萬不能爲了這件事，中他們的詭計，只能設法跳出這一個魑魅圈子，便冷冷的說：</p>
<p>「你們旣是講道理，那很好說話……現在我同我外甥是一路的，不便替自已說公這，你們請問問這些同車的，究竟是怎麼一回事。」我說着，把手指了指近身邊一圈人。</p>
<p>也不知道這些國民，是篤信着「各人自掃門前雪」的哲學信條呢，還是畏怕這幾個渾蛋巡警，還是知道其中透露着一個圈套，祗經我這麼一指，好像我手上有法術似的，大家不的而同，搶先的背轉身走開了。</p>
<p>「跟他們說什麼，逮下去再說！」那商人打扮的，有些焦燥了。說也不信，就在這一句話剛說完，那火車也慢慢停了下來。原來已經到了雙橋站了。</p>

<h3>戒愼</h3>
<p>— 少夫</p>
<p>在中國新聞專科學校成立一週年紀念的招待會上、潘公展先生會提及一件事，他說：近來各方面似乎有對新聞記者戒愼的趨向，這趨向對於記者可以說是好的，那是表示愼重，表示負責；也可以說是壞的，因爲多少有憎惡的意味；無論屬於哪一方面，我們都該自反自肅一下，否則，在採訪新聞上，多少會蒙受到影響。</p>
<p>由於這段話，我同時想起紐約時報週刋最近刋載的勃萊爾一篇評述杜魯門總統的記者招待會一文，其中有兩段說：</p>
<p>「美國總統記者招待會，可說是美國民主思想的主要說明。因爲美國政府連同大總統的權力來源，都是被治者的允諾。所以政府官吏是公僕，他們的作爲得向人民負現。新聞記者在記者招待會上可非正式地代表美國人民責問其行政當局。』</p>
<p>『總統在等待記者們進來時，往往向他桌旁附近的人招呼，直呼他們的名字，狀甚親暱，當招待員說了「到齊」後，全塲靜默。前座的嬯笑，後座的聊天，立刻都停止了。總統站了起來，他不再是「常人」杜魯門，他是美國的總統，他的前面是美國自由報紙的代表，以及其他國家的記者。」</p>
<p>新聞記者本身固然需要自反自肅，而大家將責任分得淸，守法，公與私不併爲一談，也是最基本的一件事，倘使大家都能如此，那就無所用其戒愼了，因爲戒愼寖假而會演變成爲封鎖的。</p>
<p>廣告雜談</p>
<h3>希奇古怪　古今皆然</h3>
<p>隨便打開一張報紙來看那些一方格一方格廣吿中，不難看到許多離奇古怪的圖畫和文字。人首蛇身的美人，腫肚胖脚的嬰孩，時髦裸體的女子，爛頭爛脚的病人，令人一眼望去，美感與惡感都會同時發作。再從那方格中的文字詳細看看，大多數的「廣吿文學」，呌人作嘔不得，發笑不得，咒駡不得！原因是那五光十色的似通非通的文字中，沒有不夾着「妙品」，「大王」，「轟動」，「空前」，「犧牲」，「美味」等等的好字眼，千篇一律，千年不變！</p>
<p>自然，也有一部份能够標新立異，引人注目的好廣告，如不久前有幾家鞋帽店的廣吿，其製作確是別出心裁。更有不少廣吿，離奇古怪，耐人玩味，最近在香港某中文報上，看到一則廣吿，題目是「介紹我國奇醫×××先生用藥改良社會風化」，內開：「×醫士發明最新奇藥：戒自殺丸，戒害民丸，戒姦淫丸，戒離婚丸，戒自由戀愛九，孝順父母丸，和氣致祥丸，慈善爲懷丸，戒觀不良電影藥散，戒觀導淫戲劇丸……等，以上各藥，對症服用，無不神奇。」此廣吿中所開各丸究係何物？抑別有所指？眞使人感到莫明共妙。</p>
<h3>特此通告</h3>
<p>記得從前在報上看見過一段廣吿，孫是當時某統稅局的通吿。其內容是：「爲通告事；本局茲聘任鄒××醫師爲醫藥顧問，除函聘外，特此通吿。鄒醫師診所……電話……門診……×××醫統稅局啓。如此替醫師做廣吿，實是見所未見。</p>
<p>這裏，寫一些世界各國奇奇怪怪的廣吿，道些廣吿並不限於報紙上所見。</p>
<p>印第安旁觀報中曾載一廣吿：「美蘇杳皂，功能淸潔皮膺，使之美麗芳香，興奮你的身體及靈魂」。並謂貨品的質地超過一切歐洲肥皂，因爲「假使你是男人用了這肥皂事業定會發達；假如是女人，你馬上能找到好丈夫」。</p>
<p>西班牙有一家規模極大的金銀首飾店，以眞金裝成一具骷髏，所有頭，手，足，身，都以金子塑成，更裝上電氣活動機，使這骷髏伸手舞脚的活動起來，做出種種使人驚異的動作，吸引路人注目。這新奇的廣吿，還得到該國廣吿展養會的首獎。</p>
<h3>墓碑妙用</h3>
<p>— 征</p>
<p>巴黎某公墓中，有一塊墓碑是這樣寫着：「永明燈發明人福尼安之墓。他所發明的燈，每小時僅耗費油一生丁。他又是一個好父親，好兒子，好丈夫他的寡妻現在還繼續着經營永明燈業，貨品可送達全城。覩此墓者，希勿忘對街的燈店」。這樣的做廣吿，簡直匪夷所思。更妙的，墓碑上有做起徵婚廣吿來，那是在美國馬歇邱雪斯某公墓中，有一塊墓碑上有着如此一段妙文：</p>
<p>「紀念約翰·H·萊頓，死於一八〇〇年八月六日，他的遺妻異常悲傷，希望有情的人們去安慰她，她很年靑，芳齡只有二十四，具備一切好妻子的美德。住在本村敎堂街四號」。</p>
<p>天下之大，眞是無奇不有！</p>
<h3>出洋</h3>
<p>— 戈枕</p>
<p>讀了申報所載「直放舊金山」一文，才知道留學手練的麻煩，有如「過五關」，「斬六將」，必須過了關，然後才能够乘長風，破萬浪，算是衡出了重圍，獲得了留學的機緣。</p>
<p>自然，這並不是說每個留學生都要經過如此這般的麻煩手續。近水樓台，儘可先得良緣：有的跟着　國要人，充當一名掛名隨員，有的請求來一個特許，有的目充外交官太太，有的作了出　　醫的要人的侍從，也就可以飄洋過海了。過了一年半載回到祖國來，就自命爲「留學生」。</p>
<p>直正的够資格的留學生，似乎不該如此「馬虎」。先得在國內培養出相當的能力，不要像上述的情形那樣：出國時無目的而去，回國時無收穫而回。如果是一個政治系學生，進耶魯，牛津，劍橋或其他大學都不妨，畢業後在國內辦辦事，熟悉了太國政情，不妨重涉外洋，派在駐外機關內辦事，增加些閱歷。如此內外遣調，必收實效。否則有名無實，何必呢？</p>
<p>科學常識</p>
<h3>流星飛</h3>
<p>— 一鶴</p>
<p>報載十月八日夜有數千流星（Meteor）飛過太空，宛如天上熖火，並將繼續三日，至十日方止。流星古稱奔星，我們在晴天晚上，抬頭望天空，常見有一星自一處走向他處，經過處並有一條亮光，是爲流星；所謂流星，實際上並非如天上的星一樣，而且不是星。要知宇宙萬物有互相吸收的性質，即萬有引力，故各種的星體散布於宇宙，間或和他屋相近，則便被引一部分去，如果他星被地球所吸，而一部分至地球上來的，便是流星。</p>
<p>流星因急速下降至地球，而遇到地球空氣層時，因磨擦而呈白熱狀態，故而能見光芒，其流行的速度，每秒種二十至四十英里，平均的三十五英里，在離地面二百餘里時發熱最大，到距地面的五十里時，便因其自身的燃燒而毀滅所以流星祗不過是一個敏疾的天空旅行者而已，但有的流屋過大，雖至地面附近還未燒完而降落至地面上的，便稱爲隕石（Meteorte），據化學的分析,知道隕內大部分是氧,鐵和硫黃。</p>
<p>所謂塵埃的都市裏，爲什麼有這許多灰塵的呢？道除却一般的煤烟外，可說大部分是流星製造的，因爲流星燃燒時所餘的灰燼皆散落於地面的緣故。</p>
<p>流星白天也有，不過我們肉眼看不見罷了！如果流星成羣的飛向地球便稱流星羣或流星雨；每年中有一定的季節有流星羣的，例如六月底的天琴座流星羣，十月中旬的獵戶座流星羣，十一月底的仙女座流星羣等，且各種流星羣所發的光色各有不同，如獅子座流星羣所發出的光爲藍綠色，而仙女座流星羣則爲紅色。</p>
<p>純粹的隕石或灰燼，能够在北極孤島如格林蘭等地找到，因爲那地方無人烟，無別的灰，祗有隕星灰，所以拿雪溶解而得的沉澱，即是純粹的隕屋灰，可供研究。</p>

<h3>羅斯福　法蘭絲如何應付史達林（3）</h3>
<p>— 潘金著葛春梁譯</p>
<p>「當史太林立起來接受劍的時候，他被情感衝動的形態，我知道，那確是很眞實的，他伸出了他的雙手，從紅色的　墊上拿了那支劍，眼中郤含着淚，那是我自己親眼所看見的，他很迅速地鞠着躬，並目向着那支劍接着吻，那偉大的有禮貌的表示，我知道決不是故意裝出來的，那的確是很名貴，很感動，也很誠懇的。</p>
<p>「他是一個很有趣的人物，他們說他是俄國的比較最不前進的部份的地方的一個鄕下人，但是讓我吿訴你，他有着我們其餘人所沒有的禮貌。</p>
<p>「邱吉爾携帶着他的女兒，撒拉，當他的女秘書和助手，常然，她是不參加會議的，但是有一天，我們正在等待着讓報館柏昭的時候，撒拉走出來到我們坐着的走廓上來，給她的父親一些什麼東西，史太林元帥，看見一個女人便立刻循禮的立了起來，險上很困惑，因爲他不知這她是誰。</p>
<p>『邱吉爾牽着她的手臂說：「史太林元帥，可不可以讓我有這個榮譽替你介紹我的女兒撒拉呀？</p>
<p>「史太林鞠了一個很低的躬，拿起她的手，用那種古式的優秀的歐洲的禮貌，在手上接了一個物，其餘的我們祗說了一聲「哈羅，撒拉」或是「好嗎？」於是，對照之下，在這時候，最優秀的禮貌是屬於元帥的。」</p>
<p>彿蘭克林，羅斯福和美國普遍的男人們和女人們之聞有一層離不開的友誼—說得遠一點，他和世界上普邊的男人們和女人們之間有着一層離不開的友誼。他熱烈地爲他們盡忠心地效勞着，甚至於，有時候，某種對他們有利的計劃，爲了某一些良好的理由，而不能實行的時候，他會查察，估計，以及設法瞭解所以不能實行的辯論：是否資金太多；是否政府干涉得太厲害；是否人民的事務受到了太多的統制，即使他看到了一個合理的理論，但是，他仍舊會說：「不錯的，但是人民需要着呀他們期望着呀！」他還能够支持到底，使這事通過。</p>
<p>他的那付使自己和他人相交的力量，是漸漸地生出來的，他以前是沒有的，舉一個例來說，常他第一次得到了他的政治工作——紐約州的參議員——還沒有呢。</p>
<p>我有一張他那時立在議會的地板上的肖照：高大和瘦削，很活動和很敏捷，在地板上走動着，那時，他很少和任何人談話的，議員也多少迴避着他的，並不特別的可愛，（那是後來才有的，）虛僞地裝出誠懇的險孔上，很少很少有笑容，有一個非常不幸的習慣，就是把頭仰起來，因爲他戴着貴族化的眼鏡，以及因爲他生得非常的高而長，於是，那姿勢彷彿他眼睛生在額角頭上的樣子，而使大部份的人們好像在仰着他的鼻息（未完）</p>

        <h1>1946.10.16</h1>
<h3>Sun Yat-sen's Comprehensive New Proposals: All Parties Eager for Communist Party Acceptance; Lei Chen Leaves Shanghai with Supplementary Opinions</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] Sun Yat-sen's new proposals regarding the current situation have been approved by the Chairman. Both Marshall and Stuart expressed satisfaction, stating, "Very good, we only hope the Communist Party will come, then the problem can be solved." The government is also eagerly hoping that the Communist Party will pull back from the brink. Lei Chen, Secretary-General of the Political Consultative Conference (PCC), who went to Shanghai last night, will return to Nanjing on the morning of the 16th. Whether there has been progress will be revealed at that time. Marshall and Stuart met twice on the 15th, in the morning and afternoon, reportedly discussing the new proposals for a long time. Although the government has not formally delivered these proposals in writing to the US side, the Communist Party, and the Democratic League, Fu Jingbo learned the details when he visited the Chairman on the afternoon of the 14th and has passed them on to Marshall and Stuart. Liang Shuming of the Democratic League visited Fu Jingbo and the Ambassador at 5 p.m. on the 15th and exchanged opinions. Fu Jingbo visited Foreign Minister Wang at 3 p.m. for a brief meeting before returning to the embassy. The Communist Party delegation also had no activity today. Sun Yat-sen will report on the recent situation of the negotiations at today's regular meeting of the Legislative Yuan.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City Dispatch] PCC Secretary-General Lei Chen arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing at 8 a.m. yesterday. This reporter visited him at his residence and inquired about the purpose of his visit. Lei stated: After Sun Zhe-sheng returned to Nanjing from Shanghai, he synthesized the opinions of the "third party" in Shanghai regarding the overall peace situation and presented new proposals to the government. This visit to Shanghai is to exchange opinions on these proposals with figures of the third party. Lei also stated that the government has always held the greatest enthusiasm for peace. As long as the CCP can participate in peace talks, the situation can be resolved smoothly. As for the military action in Zhangjiakou, it was entirely out of necessity and has no impact on the overall peace situation. When asked by the reporter about the content of Sun's new proposals, Lei stated that it was not yet time to disclose them. When the reporter asked if the government had any opinions on Sun's new proposals, Lei stated that the Chairman had not expressed anything on the new proposals that Sun had brought back, but according to his personal observation, if Mr. Zhou Enlai could return to Nanjing for discussions in the near future, the problem would be easily solved. According to the reporter's inquiries, Lei Chen, after arriving in Shanghai, held separate talks yesterday morning at Fan Yuan on Haig Road and No. 8 Difeng Lane on Ditilu Road with the Democratic League and the Youth Party, the content of which is not known. According to the opinion of a certain political observer, the government's desire for peace remains very firm. If the CCP also has peace in mind, the situation may improve in the near future. However, the military has not stopped, and the possibility of change is still very high, so people from all sides working for peace must seize the time.</p>
<p>Furthermore, PCC representative Mo Dehui came to Shanghai on the night train the day before yesterday, reportedly also related to the peace talks.</p>
<p>[Further News] Lei Chen and Mo Dehui have completed their missions in Shanghai and returned to Nanjing on the night train last night.</p>
<p>Suggestions from Intermediate Figures: Lei Will Convey to Government</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City Dispatch] Yesterday afternoon, Zhang Junmai, Huang Yanpei, and others from the Democratic League visited Zhou Enlai at the CCP office to discuss the overall peace situation. Reportedly, the CCP side did not express any opinion. At 6 p.m., Left Shunsheng, Chen Qitian, Li Huang, Zhang Junmai, Huang Yanpei, Luo Longji, Zhang Bojun, Hu Zhengzhi, and other Shanghai-based representatives of the Youth Party, the Democratic League, and social figures held a meeting at Jietu. PCC Secretary-General Lei Zhen was also present. First, the Democratic League reported on the meeting with Zhou Enlai of the CCP and supplemented their opinions on the overall peace situation, and the meeting ended at around 8 p.m.</p>
<p>According to Secretary-General Lei, after returning to Nanjing, he will contact President Sun after with all parties' supplementary suggestions and then convey them to the government to allow for further suggestions. Finally, Lei expressed optimism about the overall situation.</p>
<p>[French News Agency, Nanjing, 15th] Government representatives to the Political Consultative Conference stated this morning that they hope that Special Envoy Marshall and Ambassador Stuart will support their efforts to resolve the current crisis and ensure the success of the peace plan proposed by Legislative Yuan President Sun Yat-sen.</p>
<h3>If Zhou Enlai Returns to Nanjing for Discussions, a Ceasefire Agreement Can Be Reached Immediately: Sun Yat-sen's Interview with American Reporters</h3>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 15th] Legislative Yuan President Sun Yat-sen stated in an exclusive interview with a United Press reporter today: "If the Communist Party is wise, it should accept the government's new plan." He pointed out that the Communist Party has lost its military advantage, and what third-party leaders (including the Communist Party) can do now is to come to Nanjing to participate in the Three-Person and Five-Person Committees, as well as the PCC Comprehensive Task Force and the Constitution Drafting Review Committee, as the government has agreed to. Sun stated: "There is still time to discuss and draft a satisfactory agreement. The most pressing issue now is to stop the conflict. Once this problem is resolved, all other problems will automatically be resolved." He believes that if Zhou Enlai returns to Nanjing to participate in the Three-Person Committee, a ceasefire agreement can be reached. Sun continued: "The most important issue afterward will be the Constitution," and stated that if third-party leaders participate in the PCC Constitution Drafting Review Committee and complete the technical details, the government will agree to the current PCC draft constitution as the official draft in the National Assembly.</p>
<h3>Expected Good Response from the Third Party</h3>
<p>He expects a good response from the third party in Shanghai to the government's proposals, as these proposals are actually based on their suggestions. He explained that the only difference between the government's new plan and the third party's suggestion is that the third party hopes for an immediate ceasefire order, while the government must wait for the Communist Party to agree to stop fighting and for Zhou Enlai to be willing to come to Nanjing to participate in the Three-Person Committee to seek an agreement before issuing it. When asked if the government is prepared to make further concessions, he said: "If the minority parties return to Nanjing to participate in the negotiations, the government is at least willing to take a compromise to satisfy their wishes." But he does not believe that the Communist Party's demand to restore the state of January 13 in China proper and the state of June 7 in the Northeast can be accepted, "because what has been done cannot be restored to its original state," and said that the Communist Party is realistic. When asked what the government's next step would be if the new plan is rejected, and whether the government will carry out political reorganization alone, Sun replied:</p>
<h3>If Minority Parties Do Not Come, Government Will Reorganize on Its Own</h3>
<p>"If the minority parties do not come, we cannot force them." He adjusted to the government "roughly" will implement the reorganization alone. He compared the situation in China with the situation in India, and said: When Wavell invited the Congress Party and the Muslim League to organize the government, the Muslim League initially refused, but when the government was formed, the Muslim League personnel changed their attitude. When asked if the government agrees to grant the Communist Party and the Democratic League a veto in the National Government Committee, even if they occupy fourteen seats on the committee, he said: "The veto issue can be discussed, but this issue is complicated by different interpretations from all parties. If thirteen votes can constitute a veto, then the Communist Party has no reason to insist on fourteen seats." But he emphasized that "the veto cannot be of a general nature, but should be limited to certain issues and certain situations, otherwise if the minority party can overturn everything advocated by the majority party, it will create a minority party hegemony, and as a result, there will be no democracy, and the government will not be able to work."</p>
<h3>National Assembly List: May Be Announced Today</h3>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 15th] Today's newspaper. The names of the representatives of the National Assembly may be announced tomorrow, including 150 representatives from border provinces and women's groups, and 165 local representatives.</p>
<h3>Reason for Failure to Agree: Mutual Suspicion</h3>
<p>When asked if the United Government can satisfactorily develop its effectiveness once it is established, he said: "This depends on whether everyone abides by general rules, accepts reasonable suggestions, and places the interests of the country above the interests of the party. In fact, only in this way can the United Government be a government that unites for the country rather than a government with divergent opinions." Sun explained that the reason why the government and the Communist Party's demands are quite similar (i.e., maintaining the PCC and the ceasefire agreement) but have failed to reach an agreement is that: "The basic reason is mutual distrust and suspicion, as well as different interpretations of the terms of the agreement."</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 15th] Chief of Staff Chen Cheng remained in Ping on the 15th, visiting the Forbidden City in the morning and convening Shi Zhiren, Chen Yanjiong, Nie Chuanru, and other persons in charge of transportation and telecommunications institutions in North China and the Northeast in the afternoon to discuss the restoration of transportation and telecommunications.

Chen also said that the two armies in eastern Chahar joined forces at noon on the 14th. The Communist Army in Shacheng, Xin'an, Huailai, and Yanqing, except for a part that fled to the northwest and the mountains of the Northeast, built fortifications in the Fan Shanpu area southwest of Huailai. Yesterday, the air force reconnaissance found a big fire in Zhuolu City, and the Communist Army will retreat.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 15th] It is reported that Zhuolu in southern Chahar was recovered by the National Army yesterday.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 15th] In the section from Chayu Fort to Juluo Fort on the Ping-Sui Road in western Chahar, the Communist Army has not completely withdrawn. According to reports from the front yesterday afternoon, the Communist Army is building fortifications in Juluo Fort, attempting to resist. The war in that area is very fierce. Before the fall of Zhangjiakou, the Communist Army in that area had divided its troops to help, but before they arrived, Zhangjiakou had fallen, so they returned to their original positions to resist and cover the retreat.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 15th] The Communist Army and its staff and families who were defeated from Zhangjiakou have continued to transfer through Yangyuan, Weixian, Yanggao, and Guangling to Fuping, Laiyuan, and other places in recent days. This area is the Hengshan and Wutaishan mountain range. He Long's independent 23rd Brigade, with more than 5,000 people, has recently moved eastward from west of Huairen along the north bank of the Sanggan River to cover the retreat of the Communist Army.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Guihua, 15th] The Communist Army dispatched Kang Jianmin's cavalry brigade, which penetrated deep into the border between Chahar and Sui to cause trouble.

<h3>Zhu Shouguang Talks About the Situation in Shanxi Province</h3>
<p>The Communist Army's Ambition to Seize Territory Has Not Been Extinguished</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] Zhu Shouguang, Chief of Staff of the Second War Zone, recently flew to Beijing from Ping to visit the military authorities and requested instructions on the restoration work in the Datong area. On the 15th, he spoke to reporters about the situation in Shanxi Province, saying: The Communist Army's offensive in Shanxi this autumn coincided with the autumn harvest season. They attacked cities and seized land, looting food. In order to preserve some strategic strongholds and protect the people, the National Army had no choice but to make choices, so the Communist Army became rampant and attempted to take Datong first, then attack Taiyuan, in order to encompass Shanxi and open its "People's Congress of the Liberated Areas." However, the National Army had already seen through their treachery, and their conspiracies did not succeed. They were defeated in Jiuyishan and again in Jining. The siege of Datong was lifted, Zhangyuan was easily taken, and the situation in Jin-Cha has greatly changed. However, the current situation in Shanxi Province should not be taken lightly. Although the strength of the distant Communist Army has decreased, their arrogance is still strong. Recently, they besieged Baoding, Shimen, and once again attacked Fushan, Gucun, and the periphery of Datong. At the same time, one side retreated from Zhangyuan and occupied the Taihang Mountain area, and the other side strengthened its forces in Shangdang to coordinate with the Pinghan front. They also secretly crossed the Sanggan River to the town of Sanjiao in the west of Zhongyang from northern Shaanxi, which shows that the Communist Army's ambition to expand the civil war and seize Jin-Ji has not been extinguished. Shanxi is the back of North China, and Shangdang and Taihang have been military strategic areas since ancient times. In addition to stating the war situation to the authorities on this trip, I will also request instructions on protecting the people and pacifying the local areas. The people of Shanxi have suffered under the ravages of the Japanese puppets and the Communist Party for eight years, and they all hope that the government can put them at ease as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Paratrooper Battalions Will Gather in Nanjing for Training</h3>

<h3>Major Battle Expected in the Northern Section of the Pinghan Line: National Army Advances in a Fan Shape; Communist Army Fleeing from Chahar to Hebei Suffers a Crushing Blow</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 15th] After the war in Chahar came to an end, the next major battlefield will be the northern section of the Pinghan Line. The National Army has advanced in a fan shape. The National Army on the Huailai front passed Zhuolu yesterday and advanced towards the Pinghan Line. A considerable number of National Army troops in Yangcun between Ping and Tianjin are also advancing towards the triangular area of Ping-Jin-Bao. The National Army on the Pinghan front is holding its troops in place. Gaobeidian was captured by the Communist Army at 7 p.m. yesterday, and now Zhuoxian and Caohe are completely controlled by the Communist Army.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Baoding, 15th] More than 3,000 Communist troops from the 32nd, 37th, and 39th regiments of the 13th Brigade, defeated from Datong, fled through Zhangjiakou, Huailai, and Laishui to the Songlin shop, Yidou shop and other areas west of the Pinghan Line. The National Army has been fiercely suppressing them in recent days, and the Communist Army has suffered heavy losses. They are now collapsing towards Guanlizhuang, Beizicun, Yulin cun, and other areas. [Another telegram] In the northern section of the Pinghan Road, because the Communist Army destroyed several sections of the railway south of Zhuoxian to Gaobeidian a few days ago, the southbound trains from Ping once only went to Zhuoxian. Now, after the road has been repaired, trains have been restored to Songlin shop on the fifteenth. Passenger trains heading north from Shijiazhuang can reach Dingxian.</p>
<h3>Clearing of Gaomi Area</h3>
<p>Jiaodong Communist Army Extracts Gold</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Qingdao, 15th] The National Army has cleared out small groups of Communist troops near Gaomi. There are currently no traces of Communist troops within 20 li around Gaomi. Order has been restored in the city, and the county government has entered the city to work.

<h3>Further Destruction of the Beining Road</h3>
<p>Communist Army Harassment near Langfang</p>

On the night of the 14th, three places of bridges and rails between Jie County and Chazitou, between Beidaihe and Nandasi, and between Zhangjiazhuang and Liushouying were destroyed again by the Communist Army. On the 15th, the direct train from Shenyang to Kaiyuan folded back to Shenyang from Yuguan, and the traffic to Jintong only went to Guye.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 15th] The Communist Army was found harassing the area near Langfang, 12 li south of Anding on the Beining Road.</p>
<h3>Some Pocket-Shaped Communist Areas May Be Cleared Out Early</h3>
<p>[United Press, This Port News] The loss of Zhangjiakou is nothing less than a fatal blow to the CCP's military prestige. The so-called "liberated areas" of China, except for the Northeast, have now shrunk to insignificant pocket-shaped areas, which seem likely to be cleared out soon. There are currently three main pocket-shaped areas: one is the area around Yan'an, which is believed to be defended by the CCP's elite troops personally commanded by Zhu De. The second most important area is between the Pinghan Road and the Jinpu Railway in northern Henan. The third area is the National Army fighting along the canal, which is in danger of being cut into three sections. A large Communist area above Hankou in Central China has been largely eliminated by the National Army. Regardless of the strength of the Communist Army defending Yan'an, the area where the Communist Army is most concentrated is clearly in the Northeast, where land routes almost connecting Yan'an are completely cut off. Some speculate that once the CCP organizes its own government, it may make the Northeast its capital, while activating underground organizations throughout China, which may be directed by Yan'an before the loss of Yan'an. The largest city occupied by the CCP in the Northeast is Harbin, and it is believed that the CCP will defend the city to the last moment.</p>

<h3>Wang Shijing Avoids Death by Handing Over Five Tons of Gold and Silver: Capital High Court Sentences Him to Life Imprisonment</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] Wang Shijing, an economic traitor from North China, superintendent of the Finance Department of the puppet Political Committee, and manager of the puppet United Reserve Bank, was sentenced by the Capital High Court at 12:00 noon on the 15th. The verdict reads as follows: "Wang Shijing conspired with the enemy to resist this country, and is sentenced to life imprisonment and deprivation of civil rights for life. All of his property, except for what is necessary for the living expenses of his family, will be confiscated." Wang abused the puppet banknotes and collected resources to support the enemy while holding a puppet position. Because the handover after the enemy surrendered was relatively clear and he handed over five tons of gold and silver, he was spared death. However, his face changed suddenly when he heard the verdict, as if he was not satisfied.</p>
<h3>Bao Jianqing Flees to the Northeast</h3>
<p>Hebei High Court Requests Arrest and Return</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 15th] After Bao Jianqing, president of the puppet Peking University, was acquitted on July 15, he was reported again by Fu Sinian and others, and new evidence was presented. The Hebei High Court ruled for a retrial and directly ordered his detention. Bao has fled to the Northeast. Now the Hebei High Court has sent letters to the Beiping police authorities and the Northeast Security Command, the Liaoning Provincial Government, the Liaoning High Prosecutor's Office, and Shenyang Garrison to arrest him and bring him to justice.</p>
<h3>Wang Yitang Signs a Reasoned Statement for Re-Appeal</h3>
<p>His Defense Attorney Wrote a Funeral Elegy in Advance</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 15th] When Wang Yitang's defense lawyer, Wang Zanxi, went to the First Prison yesterday afternoon to ask Wang to sign a reasoned statement for applying for a re-appeal, Wang held the lawyer's left hand and said sadly: "You have done the right thing. I have no regrets about my death," and greatly thanked you, but this matter is too big." Wang Lawyer returned home and wrote a funeral elegy for Wang. The text reads: "He was a close friend of my late father. He talked about scriptures and relied on Buddha in his old age. He treated me like family. There is nothing else to hate, but I regret that you have died too late." The upper line says "to Uncle Yitang", and the lower line says "from your foolish nephew Wang Zanxi". Lawyer Wang knew that Wang would die, and from this, one can also see that the Wang and Wang families are very close. Therefore, it is a matter of fact that Wang accused He Chengjun of being a traitor and wrote an elegy before his death.</p>
<h3>Those Who Served as Jia Chiefs Under the Enemy Should Not Be Allowed to Serve as Senators</h3>
<p>Comments from a Certain Counselor of the Judicial Yuan</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] The people in the capital are also paying close attention to the question of whether those who served as baojia chiefs during the enemy-puppet period should be allowed to serve as senators, because the city of Beijing is also busy electing senators these days. On the 15th, the reporter visited a certain counselor of the Judicial Yuan and inquired about the legal point of view on this matter. According to him, in my personal opinion, those who served as puppet baojia chiefs, regardless of whether they had "relied on the power of the enemy-puppet to infringe on others," should not be allowed to serve as senators, because the baojia chiefs were autonomous personnel, and those who truly implemented the enemy-puppet decrees were this group of people.</p>

<h3>British Commercial Delegation Arrives in Capital: Bowers Outlines Mission to China; Study Bilateral Needs and Seek to Develop Trade</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] A British commercial delegation of twelve people arrived in the capital at 10:40 AM on the 15th, flying from Shanghai on two large British air transport planes. Welcoming them at the airport were Li Jun, Director of the Protocol Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs; Cheng Luo, Director of the Ministry of Economic Affairs; Gu Yuzhen, Director of the Institute; Zheng Ruogu, Counselor of the Ministry of Social Affairs; Chen Zuping, Secretary-General of the Municipal Government; British Ambassador Steven, Counselor Hua Linzhe, and several military attachés from the army, navy, and air force. Bowers, the head of the delegation, arrived on the first plane and shook hands with the welcomers upon disembarking. The entire delegation then arrived on the second plane, and after a group photo, they were driven to their residence to rest. Mr. Bowers and his party appeared to be in high spirits and expressed satisfaction with the Nanjing climate. After a brief rest, the delegation held a press conference at the British Embassy at 11:45 AM, accompanied by British Ambassador Steven. Delegation leader Bowers reported on the mission, stating that the delegation was commissioned by the government with the aim of examining China's current economic situation to facilitate greater Sino-British trade. China has suffered the longest from war and has the deepest experience of pain. During the war, China's efforts to cope with the economic crisis have been successful, and it should continue these efforts in future nation-building. The delegation's scope of investigation covers transportation, textiles, electricity, international trade, and other departments, hoping to find the crux of the problems. Speaking of the prospects for Sino-British trade, Bowers said that current trade between the two countries is limited in quantity due to the circumstances, but it has gradually increased through mutual efforts. The potential for the Chinese market is great, and there is plenty of room for involvement. He believes that once the situation stabilizes, a new China can be built, and Britain is very willing to assist China's revival with materials, because after the war, Britain is making every effort to increase exports, hoping to export materials. One of the purposes of this visit to China is to study what China needs, while Britain also needs China's grain and raw materials. Trade should be long-term and reciprocal. He also said that there are no plans to meet with Communist Party members.</p>
<h3>Bowers Answers Reporter Questions: Loan Negotiations Not Within Scope of Mission; Chinese Market Will Absolutely Not Be Monopolized by the United States</h3>
<p>The following is a record of Bowers's answers to reporters' questions: (Question) Is your country prepared to discuss loan issues with the Chinese government to develop Chinese industry during your visit to China, and what is the limit? (Answer) Our delegation's visit to China is limited to examining industry and commerce and developing trade between the two countries. The matter of loans is not within the scope of our mission.</p>
<p>(Question) When British private capital invests in China in the future, what will be the amount, and what industries will it focus on? (Answer) The amount of British private investment in Chinese industry and commerce will depend entirely on the stability of China's political situation. As for which industries to invest in, a decision can only be made after investigation.</p>
<p>(Question) After the end of the Asian war, it is expected that Chinese commerce will soon be monopolized by the United States. What is your country's opinion on this? (Answer) Britain naturally welcomes American aid to China, especially since China's industry and commerce have been severely damaged after eight years of war. The Chinese market is vast, and there are many opportunities, so it will absolutely not be monopolized by the United States. China needs a large amount of materials to rebuild its country after the war. The amount of materials needed for the five-year economic plan is enormous. The main purpose of this delegation's visit to China is to investigate China's urgent needs in industry and commerce.</p>
<p>(Question) China may raise import taxes to protect its nascent industries and save foreign exchange. What is your opinion on this, Sir? (Answer) I have no opinion on this. This question is unrelated to our mission.</p>
<p>(Question) What plans are Britain considering or have already implemented to protect Britain's large shipping and industrial investments in China? Is it currently considering selling various shipping companies or nationalizing them in order to compete with Chinese shipping? (Answer) I am unwilling to answer the former question because it is not within the scope of our delegation's mission, but if British commercial interests are infringed upon in the future, the British government will negotiate through its representatives. As for the latter, the fundamental purpose of shipping in China and Britain is not competition but to exchange materials and develop trade. Britain will assist China and will not compete with China. The materials China needs can be exported by Britain, and the materials Britain needs can be transported from China to Britain.</p>
<p>(Question) What is the extent of the recovery of Sino-British trade after the war? (Answer) This question cannot be answered. There are too many numbers required. This information can be provided in the future.</p>
<p>(Question) What are Britain's needs from China, and what are China's needs from Britain? (Answer) This can only be determined after investigation.</p>
<p>(Question) Regarding coastal shipping, has Britain negotiated with the Chinese government for permission for British mail ships and merchant ships to sail upstream on the Yangtze River to Hankou and other ports? (Answer) This issue has already been handled by the British government, which has sent a specialist, Milburn, to contact the Chinese government.</p>
<p>(Question) How will the Sino-British commercial treaty be negotiated? (Answer) This issue is also not within the scope of our delegation's mission and cannot be answered. This matter is the responsibility of the British Ambassador. From what I have heard, negotiations on the Sino-American commercial treaty are nearing completion, and the Sino-American commercial treaty may be signed before the Sino-British commercial treaty.</p>
<p>Bowers then spoke about the British production increase campaign, saying that Britain's current policy is to reduce its own supply, regardless of domestic sacrifices, and maximize the export of goods. For example, British goods that can be bought in the Shanghai market are nowhere to be found in the British market. Due to years of war, Britain has completely lost its intangible assets overseas. In order to survive, the British Empire must increase its export trade by more than 30% compared to before the war. This situation is most beneficial to countries such as China and India. However, Britain's overseas market is vast, and in terms of current exports, demand still exceeds supply. The maximum supply to China and other countries can only be achieved after Britain restores its pre-war production capacity.</p>
<h3>Minister Wang Hosts Cocktail Party to Welcome British Commercial Delegation</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] Minister of Economic Affairs Wang Yunwu hosted a cocktail party at the International Fellowship Society at 5:30 PM on the 15th to entertain the British commercial delegation. All members of the delegation and guests such as British Ambassador Steven and Counselor Hua Linzhe attended. Chinese government leaders who participated included Wu Dingchang, Zhu Jiahua, Jiang Menglin, Shao Lizi, Wu Tiecheng, Yu Dawei, Yu Hongjun, Gu Zheng, Peng Xuepei, and more than two hundred others, gathered together.

Members of the delegation exchanged views on Sino-British trade issues with Wang Yunwu, Yu Dawei, Yu Hongjun, and others for a long time. The delegation leader, Bowers, who spoke with humor, was especially welcomed. The party ended at 7:00 PM.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] The British commercial delegation's activities on the 15th were as follows: arrived at 10:40 AM, held a press conference at 11:45 AM, British Ambassador Steven's wife hosted a banquet at 1:00 PM to welcome delegation leader Bowers, visited Foreign Minister Wang Shijie, Minister Wang Yunwu, and Vice President Weng Wenhao in the afternoon, attended Minister Wang Yunwu's cocktail party at 5:30 PM, and attended British Ambassador Steven's banquet in the evening.

After leaving Nanjing, they plan to visit Qingdao, Beiping, Shenyang, Kunming, and Guangzhou.</p>
<h3>Experimenting with New Military Service Law: Nanjing, Shanghai, and Chongqing as Demonstration Areas; Military Service Bureau Has Signed a Request to the Authorities for Implementation Starting New Year's Day</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] Since the National Government announced the new Military Service Law on the Double Tenth Festival, the Military Service Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense has been actively planning its implementation. However, due to different situations in various regions, it is inevitable that there will be some difficulties in the universal implementation of the new law. In order to test the effectiveness of the new law's implementation, the bureau has signed a request to the authorities to first designate the three special municipalities of Nanjing, Shanghai, and Chongqing as demonstration areas for conscription under the new Military Service Law, and will establish divisions and regimental districts according to the size of the population. Implementation will begin on New Year's Day next year. The mayors and police chiefs of each city will serve as the supervisors of the demonstration conscription, and the detailed measures are being drafted.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Kunming, 15th] The Yunnan Military District has received an order from the Ministry of National Defense that the quota for the first phase of conscription in Yunnan Province is 12,800 people. In addition, the Kunyi Regimental District was officially handed over to the Yunnan Eastern District Regimental District on the 15th.</p>
<h3>International Emergency Food Council Resolves to Increase China's Allocation; Rice Donated by Overseas Chinese in Siam Not Included</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 14th] The International Emergency Food Council today passed a resolution to increase rice supplies to meet China's allocation needs. This proposal was put forward by our representative Chen Zhimai. Mr. Chen requested that the council first study the price agreements signed by Britain and Siam and request an increase in rice prices or export incentives to increase Siam's export volume. It is understood that Siamese rice merchants have stopped their export trade because the actual price of rice is too low. In his proposal, Chen also called for attention to the interrelationship between exported wheat and rice, as Brazil originally intended to export a large amount of rice, but because Argentina did not want to sell wheat to Brazil, Brazil also prohibited the export of its rice. Chen told a Central News Agency reporter that if the council can take effective measures on this proposal, the supplies exported from these two countries alone would be enough to cover our country's allocation of 280,000 tons. The council has also resolved that rice donated by overseas Chinese in Siam to their motherland will not be included in the allocation. Rice donated by overseas Chinese to their motherland has hitherto been included in the allocation, so today's resolution has actually increased our allocation, as some rice that has already reached our country is now recognized as a gift from our overseas Chinese.</p>

<h3>Handling of Factories in Northeast China: A Trusteeship Approach to Be Adopted; Plan to Entrust a Portion to Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Figures</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 14th] News of the Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Inspection Group's upcoming visit to the Northeast has been met with excitement and deep expectations. There are 717 factories in Liaoning Province alone, which are now being taken over by the Production Administration Bureau. The Production Administration Bureau has dispatched four groups of personnel to carry out the takeover. In addition, factories in Fushun, Sipingjie, Changchun, Jilin, Liaobei, and other places are still awaiting takeover. The handling work has just begun, and everything requires sufficient funds and manpower to recover. The relevant authorities in the Northeast plan to adopt a similar trusteeship approach, entrusting a portion of the factories to Shanghai industrial and commercial figures with a strong interest. Research and discussion are currently underway so that a proposal can be presented after the inspection group arrives. According to Director Wang of the Production Administration Bureau, the Northeast produces soybeans, of which the people themselves only use 60%, and if the remaining 40% can be exported, it can greatly enrich the people's livelihood, thereby creating a strong purchasing power among the people of the Northeast. Furthermore, Northeast industry and commerce can be unaffected by foreign goods, and raw materials are abundant and inexpensive, all of which are favorable conditions for establishing factories and doing business in the Northeast.</p>
<h3>Most of the Machinery from Fushun Coal Mine Carried Away by Soviets</h3>
<p>Current Daily Coal Production Only 4,000 Tons</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 14th] The Fushun Coal Mine is a world-renowned deposit. According to Director Cheng Zongyang, in the past three years, the enemy only knew how to produce coal for military use and did not seek to improve it. In addition, the Soviet side carried away most of the machinery, making production extremely difficult. Currently, it can produce about 4,000 tons of coal per day. The biggest difficulties at present are electricity, materials engineering, and workers smuggling, and solutions are being sought.</p>
<h3>Construction of Liao River Dikes: Surveying Work Begins</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 14th] The Liao River in the Northeast has little water conservancy and much flooding. During the puppet Manchukuo period, labor was conscripted to build dikes, but the water was not used for irrigation. Except for the rice paddies in Panshan in the southern part of the Liao River, which were largely successful, flooding has not been completely eliminated, and farmers suffer miserably. The current General Office and other agencies have decided to use a budget of one billion yuan to build or improve dikes. Surveying work has begun, and construction can begin in April next year. In the future, the completion of the project will greatly benefit the people.</p>
<h3>Explosion Tragedy at Hankou Oxygen Manufacturing Plant: Burning for More Than Ten Hours, More Than Twenty People Killed or Injured; Factory Director Song Suichang Also Dies from Severe Injuries</h3>

<h3>Jiangxi's Wartime Losses</h3>
<p>More Than 500,000 Casualties, Property Losses of More Than 10,000 Billion</p>

<h3>Important War Criminals from the Northeast: Escorted to Shanghai in Batches; Zou Renzhi Talks About His Trip to the Northeast</h3>
<p>[Our City News] Zou Renzhi, Major General and Leader of the Northeast Supervisory Group of the War Criminals Handling Committee, returned to Shanghai from Beiping a few days ago. Representatives from all parties participating in the group, including Deng Liangshi and Sun Jiejun from the Ministry of National Defense, Bi Naiqian from the Ministry of Judicial Administration, and Zhang Xiliang from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, also arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon. According to Zou and the representatives, the people of the Northeast have suffered 14 years of enslavement education by the Japanese, and even in ordinary language, they often use "Concord Language" (that is, Chinese with Japanese grammar), which is heartbreaking to see. The people have survived the disaster, but social order has not yet been achieved, and the people are either plagued by war or impoverished by making a living, and have no surplus energy to report war criminals. At the same time, the central government's various laws and regulations related to the handling of war criminals were promulgated at different times, and various agencies also enforced them inconsistently due to time and geographical reasons, which greatly affected the work of handling war criminals. After the group went to the Northeast to implement supervision, it established a War Criminal Investigation Committee to handle the matter. Taking Shenyang as an example, there were originally only 96 Japanese war criminals, but now the number has increased to 206. However, with the increasing number of war criminals in the Northeast, the agencies managing war criminals should be expanded. Some of the important Japanese criminals who have been captured have been escorted to Shanghai in batches. The group plans to go to Nanjing tonight to report on their work.</p>

<h3>The Closing of the Twenty-One Nation Peace Conference</h3>
<p>The Paris Twenty-One Nation Peace Conference closed at 2:00 PM yesterday. Since its opening on July 28th of this year, it has lasted exactly two months and eighteen days, making it arguably the longest international conference in history. During the conference, the representatives of various countries, due to differences of opinion and conflicts of interest regarding post-war European issues, engaged in countless debates. Many representatives argued until they were hoarse, unable to stop, causing repeated disturbances and causing the world to worry about the future of the Paris Peace Conference. However, the people of the world, without exception, yearn for peace, especially in European countries, which urgently demand a return to normalcy as soon as possible. They have an attitude of only allowing success and not failure for the political and diplomatic efforts of various countries towards peace. Under these objective conditions, the Paris Peace Conference finally passed the draft peace treaties with Italy, Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Finland, awaiting only the final decision of the Council of Foreign Ministers of the Four Powers before they could be signed and established. Therefore, the passage of five draft peace treaties by the Paris Peace Conference, in any case, cannot but be regarded as the initial success of the twenty-one nation representatives in creating world peace.</p>
<p>Recalling the beginning of the Peace Conference, the differences of opinion among the countries almost reached their peak. The representatives of each country spoke from their own national positions, each with their own theories and claims, making it difficult to have any hope of compromise. In particular, the attitudes of some national representatives almost completely lacked the demeanor of diplomats: during debates, they would argue until their faces turned red; when attacking others, the wording used was close to abuse. So-called diplomatic language and international etiquette were rarely seen in the Peace Conference. Therefore, in the early stages of the Peace Conference, the world believed that it would be difficult to reduce the differences of opinion among the countries to the lowest possible limit in the draft peace treaties. At the same time, observing the situation of the Peace Conference, it was clear at a glance that there were two opposing groups: one was the Slavic group, and the other was the Anglo-American group. Although China and France were extremely willing to act as bridges between these two groups, mediating between the two sides to achieve a compromise, they were still unable to eliminate the existence of the groups; especially some small countries, either cheered and waved flags at the conference, willingly becoming the echo chambers of the big countries, or spent their time outside the conference indulging in pleasure, not asking about the affairs of the conference, leaving it to a few powerful countries to manipulate. Therefore, this Paris Peace Conference still could not escape the style of power politics; all decisions were in the hands of a few powerful countries.</p>
<p>Later, although many subcommittees were established to carry out work separately, they still could not be promoted, and progress was slow. Any subcommittee meeting inevitably ended in a tongue-lashing, resulting in nothing. And the days and months passed easily, week after week, causing the representatives of various countries to feel tired of the meetings, and the United Nations General Assembly was scheduled to meet on October 23, which was approaching in an instant. Since it could not be postponed again, the Paris Peace Conference had to close on October 15. Therefore, it was decided to intensify efforts and limit the work of each subcommittee to end on October 4. Only in this way could substantial progress be made. However, for some important issues, the method of avoiding the important and dwelling on the trivial was adopted, and the matter was left unfinished. On the 8th of this month, the peace treaty with Italy was passed, and the peace treaties with Romania, Hungary, and Bulgaria were also passed one after another. On the 14th, the peace treaty with Finland was also passed, finally allowing the Peace Conference to achieve satisfactory results. Barely satisfactory, it can be regarded as a consolation at present.</p>
<p>Today, the world has realized the difficulty of creating world peace, which is even more difficult than winning a war. Taking European peace as an example, since the unconditional surrender of Nazi Germany in May last year, the European war can be regarded as over; however, until October 15 this year, only five draft peace treaties have been completed, and it is still necessary to wait for the final decision of the Council of Foreign Ministers of the Four Powers, which shows the slow progress of peace work. Moreover, the core of the European problem lies not in Italy, the Balkans, or Finland, but in the German problem. At present, Germany is still under the joint control of the four powers of Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union. How to restore Germany to normal as soon as possible, so that it can become one of the peace-loving countries in the international community, is the most urgent problem to be solved at present. What's more, the iron curtain of Europe is heavy, and the situation of confrontation between Eastern and Western Europe has long been brewing, and it has become even more blatant recently. However, at the meeting of the four foreign ministers the day before yesterday, when discussing the German problem, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov still insisted that it would be better to discuss the German problem in Europe than in New York, and US Secretary of State Byrnes also expressed his agreement in principle. According to this, only after the closing of the United Nations General Assembly can the four foreign ministers return to Europe to discuss the German problem, which will be in mid-December or late December.</p>
<p>From this, it can be seen that the completion of five draft peace treaties in this conference is an initial success in the direction of peace; however, the creation of peace is not easy, and this initial success is also enough to encourage the political and diplomatic figures dedicated to peace to begin their more difficult and heavier work, the peace treaties with Germany and Japan, so that the post-war world can enter a new era of peace and democracy as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Central Bank Business Conference</h3>
<p>The Third Session of the Central Bank's Executive Council opened in the capital on the 11th; this is the first Executive Council meeting since the Second Session held in the wartime capital seven years ago. The Executive Council meeting seven years ago was held during the difficult stage of the War of Resistance Against Japan, when the frenzy of Japanese warlords was continuing to rise; now, the holding of the Third Executive Council meeting is when the Japanese invaders have surrendered and final victory has arrived. The seven years between the Second and Third Executive Council meetings is a historically significant stage; and in these seven years, the Central Bank, under the successive leadership of former Presidents Kong and Yu and the current President Bei, has made considerable achievements in the implementation of our country's financial policies; although our country's current financial crisis is deepening day by day, how the Central Bank cooperated in the completion of the War of Resistance during the War of Resistance period is well known and worthy of praise. Now that victory has arrived, the convening of the Executive Council meeting at this time, reviewing the past and planning for the future, will, it is deeply believed, make a great contribution to the consolidation of post-war finance and the future of our country's economic recovery.</p>
<p>At the opening of the Central Bank Business Conference, Chairman Chiang, in the midst of his busy schedule, issued a special instruction, with some encouragement, which shows the Chairman's concern for this Central Bank Business Conference. In this instruction of the Chairman, we see such phrases: "In the future, financial measures should be coordinated internationally and meet the needs of the economy domestically. This is the greatest responsibility of our Central Bank, and it is also the most arduous task at present." Indeed, the greatest responsibility of the Central Bank at present is nothing more than how to obtain international coordination and meet the needs of the economy domestically. Regarding obtaining international coordination, since the establishment of the International Monetary Agreement and the International Bank, financial business has become increasingly internationalized, and our country is currently in a situation of inflation. How to strengthen our country's finance and consolidate our country's monetary system requires international coordination. As for meeting the needs of the economy domestically, it concerns the nature of the institution and the issue of the application of the institution.</p>
<p>In terms of the nature of the institution, under the call for "banking specialization," the Central Bank should especially become the bank of banks. Since the implementation of the legal tender policy, and with the development during the War of Resistance Against Japan, the position of the Central Bank has become far more important than before the war. To adapt to this new environment, the government is preparing to amend the Central Bank Law to determine the new position of the Central Bank. Making the Central Bank the bank of banks is almost a unanimous demand of the country, so how to make it the bank of banks is especially a concern of the people. From a negative perspective, since the position of the Central Bank is higher than that of general banks, it should not engage in the business of general banks, especially the business of general commercial banks, such as remittance and discounting. From a positive perspective, the powers of the Central Bank should be expanded so that it can bear the mission of becoming the bank of banks. Judging from the powers conferred on the Central Bank by the draft amendment to the Central Bank Law, it seems that in addition to making it the bank of banks, it is also intended to make it the sole issuing bank, and on the other hand, it also wants to give it the performance of a "financial department." If the institution of the Central Bank is reorganized according to the plan of this amendment, although the powers of the Central Bank will be expanded, the national financial system will inevitably suffer adverse consequences. Therefore, we advocate that the powers of the Central Bank should indeed be expanded so that it becomes the bank of banks, but the national financial system must also be respected.</p>
<p>First, we believe that making the Central Bank directly subordinate to the National Government, and its president being a specially appointed official, seems to create a situation of opposition to the Ministry of Finance, which is in charge of finance. Since the state has established the Ministry of Finance to manage the state's finances, it seems more reasonable for the Central Bank to be subordinate to the Ministry of Finance and subject to the supervision and control of the Ministry of Finance. The Ministry of Finance is the department in charge of banks, and it also has a Currency Department to manage finance. If the financial policies set by the Ministry of Finance do not receive the support of the Central Bank, it will inevitably form a stalemate, making the Central Bank a de facto Ministry of Finance. Therefore, for the sake of the national system, the powers of the Central Bank should indeed be expanded so that it becomes the bank of banks, but its position should be under the Ministry of Finance, subject to the supervision and control of the Ministry of Finance.</p>
<p>Second, the Central Bank's becoming the bank of banks does not lie in seizing the powers that should belong to the Ministry of Finance, but in assisting the Ministry of Finance in the execution of these powers. Making the Central Bank the sole issuing bank should be supported in principle; but this does not mean that the Central Bank has the power to decide on the monetary system and freely issue currency. The power over the monetary system and currency management belongs to the Ministry of Finance and not to the Central Bank; the latter is only executing the decisions made by the Ministry of Finance regarding the monetary system and currency management.</p>
<p>As for the application of operations, since the Central Bank has the task of the bank of banks, at a time when the industry is declining and the people's livelihood is uneasy, it should especially "meet the needs of the economy domestically" to revitalize finance, that is, to quickly open up rediscounting and re-discounting. At present, industrial and commercial production enterprises need loans. Due to currency depreciation and increased costs, the demand for funds is huge. The loans and disbursements of commercial banks cannot meet the actual needs of industrial and commercial production, which affects construction. The Central Bank should fulfill its mission and handle re-mortgaging and re-discounting so that industrial and commercial production enterprises can be adjusted and become more active. There are many other aspects of business improvement; This Central Bank Business Conference brings together the heads of the bank in various places to study in detail; after the closing of the conference, there will be improvements, which goes without saying.</p>

<h3>Zhejiang Provincial Assembly Resolution: Provincial Government Decides to Follow Most of It; Winter Relief Work Relief Urgent Relief is Being Planned</h3>
<p>[Report from Hangzhou, this newspaper, 15th] After the resolutions of the first general meeting of the Zhejiang Provincial Assembly were sent to the Provincial Government, they have been studied and decided by the Provincial Committee based on the consistent policy of complying with the opinions of the civil opinion organs as much as possible. The following are the resolutions obtained by a reporter from this newspaper: In terms of civil affairs, the case of abolishing the Commissioner's Office must be submitted to the Central Government for instructions. Guaranteeing the staff of the county government, the new county government will be allocated half of the construction cost by the province, and the two cases are planned to be handled. Maintaining the townships and towns, the area will be handled as much as possible. The case of establishing Wencheng County as soon as possible will be urged to the Central Government to establish it. Replenishing the maritime equipment of the Maritime Police Bureau of Chongbinwai, the Department of Finance will directly allocate 80 million yuan.

The two cases of piloting the popular election of county magistrates and the reduction of the county government departments will be replied to by letter. Regarding finance, the case of raising the office expenses of various agencies, schools, and groups will be handled, but it must be subject to the restrictions of the provincial financial sources. The case of the Sanmen County Yuanfa using the fields as a symbol to collect the house police donation will be ordered to be corrected again. The case of reducing the Ninghai County house police donation will not be handled.

The case of reducing the land tax and postponing the collection of the land value increment tax must be submitted to the Ministry of Finance for instructions. The case of postponing the collection of accumulated grain will be replied to by letter. The land declaration and land registration are not real enough to be the standard for collecting field tax. The Qingtu County reported that the public announcement has not been completed, and the results will not be used to collect field tax this year. The other counties will review and correct the results to remedy the situation. For all regulations on accumulated grain, before the regulations issued by the Ministry arrive in the province, the original methods established by this province will continue to apply, and the accumulated grain will be cleared up within a time limit. The case of handling processed surplus rice can be handled. The case of allocating and purchasing flat-priced rice to the employees of each newspaper must be submitted to the Central Government for instructions. Regarding land administration, the case of adjusting the ownership of field bottom and field surface can be notified to all counties for compliance. In addition, the Zhejiang Provincial Assembly Standing Committee held its first meeting and discussed 21 cases, including the initiation of a province-wide donation for the 60th birthday of the Head of State, the establishment of a city in Wenzhou, and the opening of Hangzhou City with no prohibition on social tea and dance.</p>
<p>[Report from Hangzhou, this newspaper] Zhejiang suffered heavy losses during the war, and the aftermath of the war is full of scars. This summer, floods, droughts, insects and other disasters have occurred from time to time. Now, as the winter season is approaching, the Provincial Government is actively planning projects related to transportation, water conservancy, and the construction of houses and sea embankments, as well as handling a large amount of urgent relief to tide over the difficulties.

Viewing the severity of the disaster situation in Zhejiang Province, the Deputy Director of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration China Branch, Billy Fan, and the Director of the Branch, Samson, came to Hangzhou a few days ago to investigate and inspect the general situation of the Zhejiang and Fujian Branch of the Executive General Office.</p>
<h3>The Capture of the Big Bandit Li Defu; Approved for Execution by Shooting in Suzhou</h3>
<p>[Report from Wuxi, this newspaper, 15th] Li Defu, the famous bandit leader of Taihu Lake, and three cadres, including Hou Mingqing and Luo Ying, have been captured by the Suzhou authorities. County Magistrate Lu of Wuxian County specially sent Secretary Luo to Wuxi today to ask for instructions from the Wuxi Command Post. Chief of Staff Mao approved the execution of the three bandits on the spot, investigated and commended those who contributed, and strictly ordered the investigation and arrest of the remaining bandits. In addition, the Wuxi County Government executed two bandits, Xia Youfang and Xu Xingsheng, who robbed the Zhuji Temple today.</p>
<p>[Report from Suzhou, this newspaper, 15th] Since Li Defu, the bandit leader who entrenched himself in the four counties of Su, Kun, Qing, and Jiang, was captured and transferred to the Suzhou County Government, County Magistrate Lu has attached great importance to the issue of Li's disposal. He has telegraphed the Capital Garrison Headquarters, the Provincial Government, the Provincial Security Command, the First Pacification Area Command, the Wuxi Command Post, the Yangcheng Area Command, and other agencies for instructions and waiting for orders to handle the case. However, the Provisional County Council and other civil opinion organs of this county believe that Li has roamed the counties of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, committing adultery, killing, looting, and doing everything, and the people have suffered greatly. They have sent telegrams to Commander-in-Chief Tang, Li Mo'an, Wang Maogong, Chen Daqing, Ma Shigong, and other military and political leaders, requesting that Li be punished according to the law to satisfy the people.</p>
<p>[Report from Suzhou, this newspaper, 14th] The "New Fourth Army" Li Defu's department, which had been roaming the border of Su, Kun, and Yu, was completely destroyed on the 13th in Caitian Village, Jiashan County, Zhejiang Province. Li himself was captured alive by Liao Zongfu, the district chief of the 11th District of our Suzhou. He was escorted to the county at about 10:00 am on the 14th. When reporters heard the news and went to visit him, they saw that Li was about thirty years old, short and fat, wearing gray casual clothes and flat running shoes, in extreme embarrassment. Now, this once rampant grass bandit king has been put in prison with thirteen pounds of heavy shackles, and he will be transferred to the military for interrogation soon. In this battle, one Czech light machine gun, two submachine guns, and twelve rifles were captured, and five hostages, including Sun Dechang, the mayor of Yangxiangjing Town, Kun County, who were kidnapped by Li, were rescued. County Magistrate Lu Jianhua of Suzhou awarded District Chief Liao a bonus of 500,000 yuan to reward the officers and soldiers of the self-defense force who contributed. The reporter was given a detailed account of the battle by District Chief Liao, which is recorded as follows: On the 12th, information was received that Li led more than 200 troops to entrench themselves in Qianwangbang, Xiutang Township, 11th District. Liao immediately led the self-defense force to encircle and suppress them. The two sides came into contact for five hours from 3:00 pm. Li could not retreat. At 6:00 am on the 13th, Liao and the self-defense force of Lumu Town, Kun County, joined forces and advanced in the direction of Zhejiang. Li's troops were left with only dozens of people. Until Caitian Village, which is close to Jiashan, Li ran out of ammunition and was captured alive.</p>
<p>[Report from Suzhou, this newspaper, 15th] In order to cooperate with the development of the cleanup work in the Taihu Lake area and to promote its rapid completion, County Magistrate Lu Jianhua of this county has decided to take Party Secretary Jin Yungong, a part of the security brigade, and the police brigade force, to patrol the villages and districts under the jurisdiction of the county in the Taihu Lake cleanup area at 9:00 am on the 16th, including Mudu, Guangfu, East Dongting Mountain, and West Dongting Mountain. However, the destination is the remote rural areas of the four districts, or the remote townships and towns where government orders and force cannot often reach. The task is to comfort the elders and convey the government's intentions in order to recover and rectify the people's hearts. At the same time, establishing a correct Baojia system and organizing the household registration are also the main tasks. Reporter Chen Lu County Magistrate stated that this trip has been scheduled with Wuxi County Magistrate Xu to meet on the border, and then lead teams to patrol separately. The motive is, in addition to assisting the cleanup work, to take into account that some remote villages have often never had the footprints of government officials in thirty or forty years. This is the crux of the alienation between officials and the people, and it is also the way to lose the people's hearts because the people's difficulties have no way to vent. The county magistrate, as a pro-democracy official, should strive to eliminate this malpractice.</p>
<p>[Report from Changshu] The cleanup work in the Meili and Tangshi districts of Dongxiang in this county has been carried out for only two weeks, and all the lurking bandits will be eliminated. The newly appointed district chiefs, Lu Xinbin and Quan Yangqing, will rush to their posts to take over the affairs. The staff of the Meili district who were on duty have returned to the city one after another. It is reported that the important members of the internal organization of the bandits are team leaders Zhu Kun, Tao Lian, Qian Ruigen (Shang Xiang), tax collector Ren Husheng, person in charge of the garrison Cao Haoxiang, communication station chief Chu Weiwen, and economic cadre Xue Haozhou, all of whom have been arrested and sent to the county headquarters for interrogation. According to the report, 124 bandits were captured in this cleanup (including 117 who surrendered and reformed), of which 25, including Zhu Baokang and Lu Yongnian, were sent to the county, and the rest were ordered to be managed by the township Bao and listened to the verification.</p>
<h3>Dog-Headed Tiger; Vicious Beast in Wenling; Devouring Humans and Livestock</h3>
<p>[Report from Wenling, this newspaper] The dog-headed tiger is a scourge in the four villages of this county. In the summer of last year, it was even more rampant. The number of children and women who were devoured and injured was as many as four or five hundred. Afterwards, due to strict precautions, its momentum was slightly suppressed. Unexpectedly, dog-headed tigers have been found in various villages recently, and shepherds and pigs and sheep are often devoured. At about 3:00 am on the 3rd of this month, three or four dog-headed tigers were also found on Xin Street, North Gate, howling and looking for food, and they devoured several pigs and sheep in a farmer's house in a mountain pond in Beishan.</p>
<h3>Qingpu Rice Prices Soar; Reaching 75,000</h3>
<p>[Report from Qingpu, this newspaper] This county produces a lot of late rice, and the harvest is relatively late. There is a lack of food on the road. Rice merchants are using their usual tricks. The rice market has soared in recent days, breaking the 70,000 mark and creating a new record of 75,000 yuan in Jiangsu Province, and there is also a black market, which is rumored to have 80,000, which is shocking. The rise in the rice market naturally stimulates other prices. The current black market price of pork has exceeded 3,000 yuan, and other wages such as mud and water work, carpentry, tailoring, and hairdressing have also risen accordingly.</p>
<h3>More Than 100 Tons of Flour; Zhengyangguan Holds Urgent Relief</h3>
<p>[Report from Zhengyangguan, this newspaper] The Anhui Relief Branch allocated 140 tons of flour to handle urgent relief in this city.

<h3>Shan County Clears Up the Remaining Communists; More Than 600 People Surrender</h3>
<p>[Report from Xuzhou, this newspaper] After Shan County, Lunan, was recovered by the National Army, the county government sent police stations and self-defense forces to various villages to clear up the remaining local Communist troops. From October 2nd to 8th, more than 1,000 Communist rifles and more than 10 light machine guns were captured successively, and more than 600 Communist troops surrendered.</p>
<h3>Suzhou Flour Price Controls Difficult; Black Market Forms, Manufacturers Lament</h3>
<p>[Our Suzhou Dispatch] Wang Maogong, Chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, recently came to Suzhou to suppress food prices for the sake of the people's livelihood. In addition to assessing prices for rice and other major food items, Mr. Wang stipulated a price limit of 16,000 yuan per bag for flour. Later, when traveling to Wujiang, Kunshan, Taicang, and Changshu counties before returning to Suzhou, he summoned local leaders such as Special Commissioner Xu and County Magistrate Lu to instruct them to closely monitor the implementation of price controls on rice and flour. However, since the price controls on flour were implemented a week ago, all flour mills have consistently cited high costs and inability to bear losses, and have ceased deliveries. This has led to a depletion of supplies at various flour shops, causing panic in the market. Because factories cannot deliver goods at the controlled prices, retail prices are trending towards a black market. To meet the urgent needs of the market, the only condition factories impose for delivering goods is that flour shops exchange wheat for flour, thereby avoiding the blame for not complying with price controls. However, the wheat price calculated for exchange is equivalent to 18,400 yuan per bag of flour. Therefore, flour shops must sell at 18,900 yuan, including handling and other expenses, which not only violates price controls but also increases daily, defying government orders. County Magistrate Lu summoned various manufacturers on the 14th to demand that they comply with the price controls and lower prices by a deadline. However, manufacturers still cited high costs and excessive losses, and jointly submitted a document detailing their plight, requesting it to be forwarded to Chairman Wang to modify the price control measures. The document first laments that of the original sixteen flour mills, thirteen, including Yuhua, have closed down, declared liquidation, or collapsed due to the impact of the economic downturn and the exploitation of high-interest loans since the spring. The remaining three, including Taihe, are barely managing to persevere despite the difficulties. However, the transport and re-export of wheat to Shanghai has not stopped, causing the abnormal phenomenon of expensive wheat and cheap flour. Business misfortune is worsening daily. It then explains the current wheat price and manufacturing costs, calculating the losses incurred by selling at the controlled prices. It also comments that Shanghai flour mills can sell flour at the controlled prices because the government allocates them foreign wheat. Since Suzhou has no allocation of foreign wheat and is affected by the transport and re-export of wheat to Shanghai, it requests a modification of the price control measures, so that 2/10 of each factory's daily output can be sold at the controlled price, while the remaining 8/10 must be sold at cost. In this way, the government's orders, the people's livelihood, and the factories' survival can all be taken care of. It is said that after receiving the submission, County Magistrate Lu has ordered the mills to strive to maintain price controls and may consider allocating foreign wheat.</p>
<h3>### The Tiger of Southern Zhejiang Discussed; Public Trial of Traitor Kun Scheduled; Shen Honglie States That He Will Never Forgive Lightly</h3>
<p>[Our Hangzhou Dispatch, 15th] Tan Kun, the "Tiger of Southern Zhejiang," was originally a salt policeman. After Shaoxing fell in the 30th year of the Republic, he gathered bandits in the Ma'an area of Shaoxing, colluded with the enemy, and served as the head of the puppet autonomous association and the puppet Southern Coast Area Self-Defense Column Commander. He committed adultery, looting, murder, arson, and all kinds of evil deeds, causing the people to hate him to the bone. This traitor was also fickle. After defecting last year, he coveted the profits of the salt fields and clashed with Zhang Changming's troops, resulting in the washing away of Southern Coast Area. Zhou Xinmin, the district chief of Shaoxing County, was shot and killed at the Sleeping Lion Nunnery in Ma'an because he knew Tan Kun had committed many crimes. His henchman, Song Shizhang, was the main accomplice. Song was arrested in Shaoxing on December 1st of last year. Tan Kun was also arrested in Hangzhou after being secretly reported by Zhou Xinmin's wife. His accomplices have been identified and sentenced to life imprisonment. Tan Kun has also been transferred to the provincial capital by the Security Command. The trial is scheduled to begin on the 25th of this month. Zhou's wife has also come to Hangzhou to appeal to the press, demanding that he be executed. It is said that Chairman Shen Honglie has told people from all walks of life in Shaoxing that Tan Kun's crime is similar to that of traitor Tian Xiushan and will never be forgiven lightly.</p>
<h3>### Wanted: Zhang Qiliu, Secretary-General of the Puppet National Government's Civil Service Department</h3>
<p>[Our Suzhou Dispatch, 15th] The Jiangsu Higher Court issued an order on the 15th to all subordinate county courts and notified the county governments to arrest Zhang Qiliu, Secretary-General of the puppet National Government's Civil Service Department, so that he can be brought to justice.</p>
<h3>### Petty Thieves Spread Tear Gas; Patrons of Jinshan Cafe Weep Copiously</h3>
<p>[Our Suzhou Dispatch] The security of Suzhou's city temples has been repeatedly disturbed. After the four major theaters, including Beiming and Kaiming, received threatening letters, an explosion occurred at the Daguangming Cinema on the afternoon of the 12th, fortunately without causing any damage. Unexpectedly, at around 9 p.m. on the night of the 13th, unidentified individuals secretly released tear gas ingredients in the Jinshan Cafe outside the Guarmen gate. At the time, the cafe was packed with guests, singing and reveling. Suddenly, all the patrons and singers in the room wept copiously. Order was thrown into chaos as people fled in panic. The person in charge of the Jinshan Cafe reported to the City Defense Command. A thorough investigation is underway.</p>
<h3>### Received Materials in Shangqiu All Stolen and Sold; Large-Scale Hospital Disappears; Members of the Investigation Team Feel Indignant and Heartbroken</h3>
<p>[Our Kaifeng Dispatch, 14th] Wang Pingzheng, a member of the Lu-Yu Area Investigation Team, recently returned to Bian from Shangqiu, Yushi. The reporter first visited Mr. Wang at the Inspectorate of Henan and Shandong and talked for four hours. Mr. Wang was very saddened by the reception work in Shangqiu, and his indignation was evident in his words. According to what he told the reporter: Before the restoration, Shangqiu was a place where the enemy amassed large quantities of materials, and industry and commerce were extremely developed. There were 22 foreign firms alone, and more than 50 banks, warehouses, cooperatives, etc. The salt, lacquer, pig bristles, tung oil, cloth, electrical materials, etc. stored there were countless. After the enemy surrendered, Kong Tianjing led a group of officers and soldiers from the Linquan Command Headquarters to Shangqiu on August 20th of last year, and took control of all the remaining materials. They were all transported to Jieshou by cars and carts over a period of more than a month and sold. When the local special office was ordered to take over, only empty houses and broken furniture remained! In terms of military supplies, most were taken over by the First and Fifth War Zones. The First War Zone received 5 million catties of wheat from the enemy's food commune. Most heartbreaking was the shocking case of corruption in the reception of the Shangqiu enemy patient treatment center by the Kaifeng District Special Commissioner's Office of the Ministry of Military Affairs. The scale of the center and the equipment were not only unprecedented in North China but might even surpass the current Central Hospital. The center covered an area of 500 acres and could accommodate 3,000 patients. There were more than 1,500 steel wire beds, 24 of the latest large microscopes, X-rays, sun lamps, air conditioning, running water, and electricity, everything was available. After the restoration, the Kaifeng District Special Commissioner's Office of the Ministry of Military Affairs sent Yang Zhen, a major staff member of the second reception group, to take over. Apart from the barracks, which were later handed over to the Military Property Management Office of the Ministry of Military Affairs, all the medical equipment, steel wire beds, etc. were secretly transported to Zhengzhou. Zhou, who was in charge of the office, also packed 30 large wooden boxes with the most valuable medicines, secretly transported them to Zhengzhou, and embezzled them for himself. The office has not yet reported to the ministry. Now, the 67th Rear Hospital of the Logistics Department cannot find housing in Shangqiu, so they were informed by the locals that the barracks of the Armored Corps Training Headquarters is the patient treatment center. The 68th Rear Hospital has been approved by the Ministry of National Defense to take over, and the Ministry of National Defense is conducting a thorough investigation. According to Mr. Wang: The case has been submitted by the team as a special case for strict handling.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Zhengzhou, 15th] Lu Mengbin, manager of the Xinxiang Xinxing Yarn Factory, seized 150 acres of people's land, and concealed 3,000 bags of enemy and puppet materials, 800 bags of cotton yarn, etc. After the Yu-Lu Investigation Team confirmed the facts, Lu has been detained by the provincial government.</p>
<h3>### Strange Thief Robs Cars; Specializes in Kidnapping Female Passengers</h3>
<p>[Our Suzhou Dispatch] Robbery cases have been emerging one after another on the roads in Suzhou for the past two months. They occur every two or three days, and travelers are increasingly apprehensive. Although Chairman Wang has telegraphed the military police and district chiefs in charge of security in this county, ordering them to solve the cases within a deadline, no clues have been obtained, and solving the cases is even more difficult. As a result, the bandits have become even more rampant. At around 7 a.m. on the 13th, a Suzhou-Xun Automobile Company car carrying seven passengers was traveling to Nanxun, when two bandits, one wearing a yellow uniform and the other in plain clothes, jumped onto the car near the Xingxiu Bridge outside Panmen, near the city walls. When the car reached Baodai Bridge, they ordered the car to stop and kidnapped three of the female passengers. The company reported the incident to the military and police authorities, who are currently searching in separate directions.</p>
<h3>### Bridge on Suzhou-Wuxi Highway Collapses; Truck Overturns and Falls into Water</h3>
<p>[Our Wuxi Dispatch] The Suzhou-Wuxi Highway in the Zhouxin and Nanqiao towns of this county has not been repaired and reinforced since it was destroyed in the war. The bridge is corroded and cannot bear heavy loads. At 11:30 a.m. on the 13th, a large truck from the Shanghai Hemeng Company, loaded with a large number of pomelos, oranges, bananas, and salted fish, and carrying 14 passengers, was speeding towards this county when the bridge suddenly collapsed in the middle near the 6th milestone on the highway. The entire truck overturned into the river. Fortunately, the river was shallow, and nearby villagers rushed to the rescue, preventing a tragic loss of life. Only one passenger, Wang Yasheng, was injured in the chest, and two pregnant women were more seriously injured. A large number of fruits floated all over the river.</p>
<h3>### Changshu Hupu and Fushan Listed as Civil Aviation Ports</h3>
<p>[Our Changshu Dispatch] For the convenience of civil aviation, the First District Pacification Command has designated the ports of Hupu and Fushan in this county as ports for air traffic. The county government has implemented the order and strengthened local forces to maintain security.</p>
<h3>### Zhejiang Province Civil Servant Screening and General Inspection</h3>
<p>[Our Hangzhou Dispatch] In Zhejiang Province, in addition to most of the provincial civil servants being sent for review and screening according to law, there are still some who have not been sent for review. It has recently been reported that the Fujian-Zhejiang Screening Office will conduct a general inspection in this province. The Personnel Department of the Provincial Government has discussed and agreed to start the general inspection after preparation.</p>
<h3>### Looking at the Cloud of War from the Ruins of Yin; Eastern-Bound Troops Head Toward the Communist Core in Daming; By Our Special Correspondent Shao Shenzhi</h3>
<p>[Our Anyang Dispatch, 14th] The Nationalist army of Li Xianzhou in Anyang has begun to advance towards the Zhang River. The battle is taking place in Huilong town, 70 li due east. The military denied to reporters rumors that the Nationalist army had crossed the Zhang River northwards. The threat of the Communist army to Anyang cannot be said to be completely lifted, and reporters were advised not to go to the suburbs to prevent frequent accidents. The reporter arrived in this city, the northernmost front line of the Nationalist army in Henan, on the evening of the 12th. In the past few months, the Nationalist army, in order to cope with the Communist army's attacks and consolidate the position of Anyang, has been constantly engaged with it in the surrounding 200 li area. On both sides of the Anyang Lake, they have always adopted an absolute defensive posture. Hearing dense gunfire in the city at night is still a frequent occurrence. The Eastern-Bound troops are heading towards the Communist core in Daming, and the military has stated that they may be deployed there. The people of northern Henan and southern Hebei are fierce, and the four self-defense columns of the local organization have considerable strength. They frequently enter and exit the Communist area and have been quite successful on the border of Hebei and Henan. Rumors of the recovery of Cixian and Handan mostly originate from this. The north bank of the Zhang River is still the Communist army's passage from the Taihang Mountains to southern Hebei and western Shandong. After the discovery of oracle bones in Xiaotun, the Yin Ruins in Anyang became famous in the world of academia. Xiaotun is located in the northwest of the city. Mr. Dong Zuobin lived here for several years. It was heard this spring that Yin bronzes were unearthed. After the lessons of eight years of war, the people have mostly voluntarily sent the unearthed antiquities from various places to the local government for preservation. Anyang originally had an Antiquities Management Committee, and the 4 tons of antiquities it contained were transported to Nanyang during the War of Resistance against Japan. They have now all been moved back and, according to reports, nothing has been lost. The famous Liuhe Man Coal Mine is located 90 li northwest of the city. Before the war, it produced 6,000 tons of anthracite daily. It is now in the hands of the Communist army. According to visitors: the mine's machinery and caves have been damaged beyond repair. There are 13 coal mines with machinery and equipment in northern Henan, including Jiaozuo, with a total daily coal production of 15,000 tons. Other scattered manual mines are not included. However, northern Henan has become a "coal-free and light-free area". Fifteen exiled county governments along the Zhang River are gathered in Anyang, and there are more than 110 other agencies. Because refugees flock there, the population of this small city has jumped from 50,000 to 150,000. The autumn wind is rustling, and the clouds are connected in all directions. I really don't know when I can return home.</p>

<p>Rice Merchants Request Cancellation of Export Tax</p>
<p>Qing County is a rice-producing area. More than 1,000 piculs are exported to Shanghai every day. Since April of this year, the First District Office has been levying an export tax of 2 sheng of rice per picul on rice merchants. It was found that the government had long issued an order to cancel the export tax on rice, and there is no such rice tax in neighboring counties. Inquiring of the district office, they said it was to subsidize local undertakings. The county government is now borrowing food from the tenants for subsidies. It is reasonable to cancel this kind of rice export tax as soon as possible, but in fact it has not been implemented, and the tax is increasing rather than decreasing. Merchants and the people really cannot bear the burden. Please ask the relevant authorities to cancel the excessive tax as soon as possible to avoid losses to merchants (A rice merchant in Qingpu). I am a student, and I have seen many younger brothers and sisters lose their education because they cannot enter public schools and cannot afford the high tuition fees of private schools. Now, as a student, I would like to contribute some opinions to everyone. Recently, schools in various places have been experiencing "overcrowding", especially in Shanghai, where thousands of people apply but only a few dozen are admitted. This is a very serious problem. Education is the link between national politics and economy, and the second generation is the future master of the country. Groups of students are rejected at the door. They cannot get education and resent and get angry, or even laze around and do negative and illegal things. This is very dangerous for the future of the country. The reasons are nothing more than three points:</p>
<p>(1) Since the eight-year War of Resistance against Japan, the general level of knowledge of people has not improved. On the contrary, it has decreased due to wartime displacement and abandonment of books. However, the desire for knowledge is much more urgent than before.</p>
<p>(2) Educational and cultural institutions in various places have been destroyed by the enemy puppets, and the number of schools has generally decreased.</p>
<p>(3) A large part of the farmers in small towns and villages have been swept into the cities by the tide of the times. To seek a proper solution, there is only a palliative method. The country is still in a chaotic period, education work cannot be smoothly promoted, schools cannot be established immediately, and teachers are also in short supply. Moreover, it is impossible not to let many people study. The palliative method is to change the school system -- using the two-part system and the three-term system together.</p>
<p>The two-part system changes class time to two shifts, morning and afternoon, teaching in separate shifts, with earlier mornings and longer afternoons. The three-term system is three terms a year, with shorter winter and summer vacations. It has four advantages:</p>
<p>(1) The two-part system can double the number of students enrolled.</p>
<p>(2) The three-term system can also increase the number of students enrolled because the period of study is shortened. For example, a middle school originally requires six years, but now it can be completed in four years. The remaining two years can be used to teach more students.</p>
<p>(3) Teachers have a difficult life. More teaching can increase income, and teachers' lives may be stabilized and improved.</p>
<p>(4) At the beginning of the country's victory and construction, there is a great need for talent. Shortening the duration of students' studies can also allow them to serve the country and society earlier. However, the above method also has shortcomings, such as:</p>
<p>(1) The curriculum must also be thoroughly reformed. In a short half-day, time is already very tight. Schools only teach academic subjects, and technical subjects are studied by students themselves outside of class. For example, art, music, calligraphy, etc. in middle schools are all canceled. If you are interested, you can study them outside of class. Half a day is enough time.</p>
<p>(2) Although teachers' income is slightly higher, they are overworked and mentally exhausted. The only solution is to set up more specialized teacher training institutes, where teachers with similar interests specialize in one subject, so that the workload is not too burdensome and students benefit more.</p>
<p>It seems that talking about this issue now is "outdated", but time flies, and the winter vacation is about to begin. For the sake of the future of the entire country and nation, we cannot ignore the importance of education. I am a student with limited wisdom and knowledge. My humble opinions may not be appropriate. I hope that people with knowledge will not hesitate to correct me. It would be fortunate for me, and fortunate for the country. (Li Wenxue)</p>
<p>The Swindle of a Night School Principal</p>
<p>I am a poor child who has dropped out of school because my family is poor and I have no money to go to a private school. I have to stay at home. One day, I went to the road to play and saw an advertisement for enrollment in a (compulsory night school for knowledge). (Class time is 6:00 PM-9:00 PM) Report address (in 557 Changde Road, also falsely named (Student Union) School starts on September 9th. I immediately signed up and paid a deposit of 10,000 yuan, and they gave me a receipt. There were more than 400 classmates. After a few days, the principal (Shen Shouyan) escaped and disappeared. There were no classes and no one could find him. Until now, there is no news. I think, isn't this 10,000 yuan my father's sweat and blood? I hope that the authorities will read about this very sad thing and help me catch this swindler principal and punish him. This is a great merit! (Lu Jinfang, a poor child who has dropped out of school)</p>
<p>Please Consider the Principles for Establishing Night Schools</p>
<p>I read in your newspaper on September 27th a news item entitled "The Issue of Establishing Night Schools in Higher Vocational Schools." One of the principles decided by the Ministry of Education is: "Higher vocational schools may establish night schools, but these are not formal schools, but schools of a supplementary nature." I believe that this move has a great impact on the future of vocational youth and is tantamount to closing the door for vocational youth to study. At a time when living is difficult and the number of people who have dropped out of school and are unemployed is large, it seems necessary for the Ministry of Education to consider it. (Qinghao)</p>

<h3>Guo Taiqi Serves as Chairman of the Final Conference; Peace Conference Held Closing Ceremony Yesterday; South Country Representatives Dissatisfied with the Italian Peace Treaty and Refused to Participate; Four Foreign Ministers Gave Speeches Encouraging Each Other to Strive for Peace</h3>
<p>[Our Report] London, 15th, Broadcast: After two months of discussion, the Paris Peace Conference finally held its last meeting at 3 p.m. today (Greenwich Mean Time, 11 p.m. Shanghai Time). In this final act, the Yugoslav representative put on a surprising performance, announcing that the South Country could not accept the treaty with Italy passed by the majority of the conference and decided to withdraw from the conference. This episode was unexpected by the representatives, and the action taken was the same as that taken by Soviet representative Gromyko in the Security Council. The American representative was the first to arrive, followed by the Soviet and British representatives, and Bidault was the last. The chairman was Guo Taiqi, the Chinese representative. Guo gave a closing speech, praising the achievements of the conference and saying that peace is indivisible. He hoped that all countries would eliminate prejudices and work for peace. Guo then officially read a letter from Yugoslavia, stating the reasons for the South Country representatives' withdrawal. At this point, Bernes took the floor and said that countries should not only know each other, but also recognize their respective responsibilities, eliminate prejudices, and work together for peace. Bernes emphasized that no country can win in war alone, nor can it win peace alone. All countries must work together for the benefit of mankind. The conference adjourned after passing general recommendations on the five-nation peace treaty.</p>
<p>[Our Report] Paris, 15th, Broadcast: Molotov said in his speech at the Peace Conference: The Soviet delegation wholeheartedly agreed with Bernes' feelings and expressed gratitude for the efforts of all countries to cooperate for peace. Bevin also took the floor and expressed his gratitude for the warm reception of the French government. He said that there was no more suitable address for this Peace Conference than France. France has contributed a lot to the common victory. Its rapid recovery is truly commendable. After Bidault gave his final speech, he announced the adjournment of the Peace Conference at 4:25 p.m. (Paris time).</p>
<p>[Our Report] Paris, 15th, Urgent Broadcast: The Peace Conference held its closing ceremony today. The semi-circular representative seats in the venue were full of vitality, which was rare in previous sessions. By 3 p.m., most of the representatives of the countries had arrived. Chairman Guo Taiqi presided over the meeting at 3:10 p.m. and proposed to provisionally adopt the recommendations on the five-nation peace treaty made by the Peace Conference because the Secretariat had not been able to distribute the original text of the treaty in time.</p>
<p>[Our Report] Paris, 15th, Broadcast: This afternoon, the Luxembourg Palace was more crowded than ever. The masses were vying to catch a glimpse of the style of the diplomats from the 21 countries, most of whom will leave Paris tonight. Inside the palace, the semi-circular representative seats were not full, but the press seats were packed, with almost no room to stand.</p>

<h3>American, British, and Soviet Foreign Ministers Leave Paris; Foreign Ministers' Meeting to Be Held in New York; Preliminary Discussion on the German Issue</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 14th] The Paris Peace Conference has ended, and the four foreign ministers are now preparing to leave for New York to attend the United Nations General Assembly. However, the four foreign ministers have not completed the work of the Paris Peace Conference, so during the six weeks of the United Nations General Assembly, they will discuss the resolutions of the Peace Conference at any time. Before leaving France for the United States, the four foreign ministers will hold a final meeting, but it will only be a formality and may not have any major decisions. After the meeting, British Foreign Secretary Bevin will take a plane, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov will take a British cruiser, and US Secretary of State Bernes will take President Truman's plane "Sacred Cow" to the United States separately and hold tight-knit talks again at Lake Success.</p>

<p>[United Press, London, 14th] Deputy Foreign Minister Mayhew declared in the House of Commons today that Hitler signed a secret agreement with the Soviet Union one month before invading Poland in 1939, and the British government has obtained the original text of this agreement.

<h3>President Truman Broadcasts; Scheduled to Cancel Meat Price Controls; Wage Controls Will Also Be Terminated Concurrently</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 14th] President Truman delivered a broadcast speech today, announcing that price controls on meat and livestock will be lifted starting November 15th, and the entire price control system will be gradually eliminated. The President stated: Lifting price controls on meat is the only remedy for the meat shortage. Those who hoard essential foods for profit are now ready to emerge; however, the truly hateful ones are those selfish people who encourage retailers to break price controls in order to gain political benefits. Wages and prices are closely related, so wage controls will also be terminated concurrently. This move does not mean the end of the entire price control policy. Some price controls, such as rent, will continue to be managed for a long time; other parts of basic raw materials and scarce daily necessities will also continue to be managed, pending a major increase in production.</p>

<h3>Pork and the U.S. Congressional Election</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent in the United States, Mao Shuqing</p>
<p>The Congressional election in early November is just around the corner. The biggest topic for election competition is not major policies for governing the country, whether domestic or foreign, but the current severe "meat shortage" issue. The Wallace incident also caused a stir in the United States, but the Wallace incident is not the main target affecting the election. The newsreel of Wallace's resignation is being shown throughout the United States. Half of the audience warmly applauded Wallace, and half applauded Byrnes; when President Truman's photo was shown, a few clapped, and a few booed. This is a microcosm of public opinion in a part of American society, and also a microcosm of the political awareness of Americans. But these are not enough to influence the election. Americans, accustomed to material life, bluntly say: They are very "indifferent" to politics. The Republican Party, which has been silent for many years, saw this point clearly. Therefore, it does not use the Wallace incident and the "differentiation" of the Democratic Party as an excuse to attack the Democratic Party. Republican campaigners tell the people every day: "Don't you have pork and beef to eat? Elect the Republican Party and the Republican Party will give you food!" The New York Times' Sunday supplement satirically quipped: "Unexpectedly, the meat shortage issue has become the current political bomb." In fact, the United States has plenty of pigs, cattle, and livestock. Like us foreign reporters in New York, we go to restaurants every day and there are plenty of meat dishes. It seemed that only one day, I ordered a "pork chop" and the waiter said no, and I never encountered a meat shortage again. Those who have truly experienced "not knowing the taste of meat for three months" are housewives who emphasize "economy." What they want is cheap, official-price pork, which is disappointing nine out of ten times. The American black market is everywhere. Compared with the sophisticated American-style politics, it is truly worlds apart. Why is the black market full of it? Because there is the OPA—the U.S. Office of Price Administration. The more restrictions the Price Control Bureau imposes, the more active the black market becomes. American public opinion attacks on the Price Control Bureau are daily and lengthy; however, the OPA once planned to abolish, and finally remained. Columbia students once distributed leaflets and launched student movements to retain the OPA. The family members of government employees in Washington once demonstrated in front of the Capitol, opposing the abolition of the OPA. They said: The OPA system is a "benevolent policy" left by President Roosevelt. Now that American inflation is so severe, once the OPA is abolished, entrepreneurs will get rich, and public employees will suffer even more! However, from whatever perspective, the existence of the OPA today more or less hinders production. Republican Congressman Rogers said in Congress the day before yesterday: "Please ask the President to think of emergency measures to abolish the OPA; once prices are allowed to float, production will be enthusiastic; according to the law of supply and demand, the more production, the lower the prices will fall." He also said: The meat shortage problem is easy to solve, the key lies in the President's determination. A spokesman for the Price Control Bureau said at a press conference: "The blind Republican congressmen are talking nonsense all day long. What do they know about economics?" He said, based on the statistics of experts from the Department of Agriculture, that the meat shortage problem can be completely eliminated within two months, and by the beginning of next year, the meat supply will be excessive. The day after he made his statement, more than eighty butchers in New York jointly wrote to the President, explaining the difficulties of their closure; specifically criticizing the fallacies of the experts from the Department of Agriculture. Their letter said: "If the government's current regulatory policies are not changed, then not only will the meat shortage not be solved in two months, but it will be permanently out of balance in two years." The New York Daily News, the newspaper with the largest circulation in the United States, has photos, pictures, and comments attacking the OPA almost every day. They published many photos of closed butcher shops, and also published many housewives with "empty" vegetable baskets. The situation in Chicago is also the same. Ninety percent of the butcher shops have already closed; 15,000 employees and workers in slaughterhouses and butcher shops are now unemployed. In any case, such a phenomenon of imbalance is ultimately a major crisis for the Democratic government in the election. The Truman government has convened several cabinet meetings to discuss resisting this "bomb" for congressional elections. Army generals support the current government. The Department of Defense first "takes the lead" and announced that the amount of meat purchased by officers and soldiers across the country belonging to the department will be reduced by 3 million pounds per week, so that the general public will have more opportunities to buy pork. Secretary of Agriculture Anderson is always optimistic, and he confidently announced to the outside world: Although the meat shortage problem is serious, the situation is improving. He cited the "Federal Slaughtering Company" as an example, saying that in the third week of September, the Federal Slaughtering Company slaughtered a total of 78,000 pigs, an increase of more than 13,000 heads compared with the third week of August; by analogy, the pre-war state will be fully restored within two months. New York Times reporter Houston sent a dispatch from Washington to New York saying; Anderson's optimistic tone "cannot be proved within two months." Truman himself is quite caught in a dilemma. His melancholy and hesitation in domestic affairs have the same point as his helplessness in diplomacy. He said: The OPA cannot be abolished at present, but how to remedy the malpractices of price controls, he has never said a reason. The press has many unspeakable feelings about the Truman government. The New York World-Telegram drew a cartoon of Truman sleeping soundly, the sunlight outside the window has already entered the room, but the president is still lying in bed, with the words next to him: "Mr. Truman, wake up! Your country is facing danger!" The day after Wallace was expelled from the cabinet, word came from Washington: OPA Director Porter was said to be about to become Secretary of Commerce, and many commentators who were usually dissatisfied with the OPA were shocked. Later, Harriman was announced as the successor to the Secretary of Commerce. The New York Daily News said: "Oh my God! Luckily it wasn't this guy!" The Telegraph and the Daily News are both newspapers close to the Democratic Party. Roosevelt, a great man of the Democratic Party, is still praised by the American people today; however, the "benevolent policies" left by Roosevelt in domestic and foreign affairs have now reached a crossroads. Should we continue to move forward? Or should we take this opportunity to turn around? Truman felt that it was difficult to choose between the two. The American people are now thinking: Should they take this opportunity to change their tastes, which they are tired of eating! (September 29th, New York Shipping News.)</p>

<h3>The End of Graft and Dereliction of Duty by Officials Accepting Takeovers; Jiang Gongmei Executed by Firing Squad; Original Sentence of Five and a Half Years of Imprisonment Changed to Death by Order; Whole Year from Arrest to Execution; Six Suicide Notes Claiming to Be Patriots</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent] Jiang Gongmei, the former captain of the Shanghai Gendarmerie, was reported for crimes such as corruption, dereliction of duty, and embezzlement. The Songhu Garrison Command sent personnel to arrest him in the late evening of October 14 last year. He has been transferred and escorted lightly over the past year. He was transferred to Nanjing, Chongqing, and finally ordered to be sent to the Songhu Garrison Command for trial. After a joint trial by the Military Law Department, he was sentenced to five years and six months of imprisonment, and was sent to Shanghai Prison for detention. The department received a telegram from the Ministry of National Defense (No. 01994) the day before yesterday, which read: "Defendant Jiang Gongmei should be changed to the death penalty, and deprived of public rights for life. You must follow the order and report the date of execution along with photos for record." So, at 11:00 AM yesterday morning, Jiang was taken back from Shanghai Prison to the Garrison Command Detention Center. At that time, the American criminal was wearing a yellow suit shirt, a wool vest, blue cloth overalls, gray socks, and black leather slippers, and his face was haggard. Seeing the strict precautions, he knew that there was little hope of survival. So, after arriving at the detention center, he asked for paper and pen and wrote six suicide notes, which were sent to his parents, wife, etc. At 2:30 PM, the soldiers of the Special Service Company took him out again. Director Xu read out the charges and told him that he would be executed immediately. If he had any last words, they could be conveyed. Jiang acted calmly and only said, "I am a patriot. I am not a soldier. After my death, please ask the news media to collect more information about me." He was immediately bound, and a sign was inserted on his back with the words "Ordered to Execute the Corrupt Official Jiang Gongmei". He was escorted to the Song Park execution ground and executed immediately. Two shots were fired, both entering from the back and exiting from the chest and abdomen. He fell to the ground and died. The body was collected by Pushan Villa. When the body was collected, the rope was untied by the coolie and roughly put into a thin coffin. It is found that the American criminal is 32 years old and from Xuzhou. (The picture shows the American criminal after the execution.)</p>
<h3>Case Files of the Grain Loan Case Transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office Today</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent] The sensational grain loan fraud case has been transferred to the judicial authorities for trial by order of Chairman [Chiang Kai-shek]. The Songhu Garrison Command followed the order and transferred all the criminals, together with the case files, to the District Prosecutor's Office today.</p>
<h3>Municipal Council; Police Affairs Committee Subcommittee Meeting; Fang Zhichao and Liu Xuehai Attend to Report on Narcotics Control</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent] The Police Affairs Committee of the Municipal Council held its second subcommittee meeting at the Council in Fuming Village at 3:00 PM yesterday. Eighteen members of the group attended, with Hou Jiyuan as chairman. Police Bureau Director Fang Zhichao and Liu Xuehai, Special Commissioner for Narcotics Control in Jiangsu and Shanghai Area of the Ministry of Interior, attended to report.</p>
<p>Director Fang first reported on the training of volunteer police in the city. He also said that in accordance with the mayor's instructions, the number of volunteer police should be expanded to 10,000, and recruitment is currently planned. Director Fang continued to describe the narcotics control situation in the city, saying: After the central decree was approved on January 12 this year, the narcotics control work was carried out in three phases: (1) From January to March was the period for registration and self-renewal. By the end of March, a total of 6,060 addicts had been registered. (2) April to June was the period for ordering abstinence. Those who still did not abstain by the end of June would be investigated. (3) July 1 was the testing period, divided into two parts: those who were literate and those who were illiterate were tested by the Narcotics Testing Institute, and those who were toxic and non-toxic were tested by the Health Testing Institute. However, due to limited funds, the Municipal Government allocated more than 17.8 million [yuan] to the Testing Institute, plus a total testing income of more than 21 million [yuan]. As a result, addicts had to provide their own clothes, and various abuses such as smuggling occurred.</p>
<h3>Many Difficulties in Registration and Testing</h3>
<p>There are two registration methods: regional testing and comprehensive testing, with age as the order, with the youngest tested first. Most smokers are 35 years old, the youngest is 19 years old, and the oldest is 76 years old. However, many difficulties arise during testing, such as changes in the address of the registrant, making it impossible to reach them, and there are also many false registrations, because during the enemy puppet period, people went to register and could be allocated opium, so even now some people still go to register with this delusion. In addition, there are substitutions for testing. As a result, of the more than 2,000 people who should be tested, only more than 1,000 have been reached so far. And addicts often do not spend money differently, and abuses abound, so it is hoped that the amount of reporting will be increased.</p>
<h3>Three Principles of Opium Suppression</h3>
<p>Commissioner Liu stated: My mission is to supervise and assess local opium suppression efforts. The central government's opium suppression policy adheres to three principles: diligent education, strict punishment, and conservation. Opium suppression is a prerequisite for nation-building. While Shanghai's opium suppression efforts have achieved good results, they are still insufficient. Pre-war surveys in Shanghai, registered with the Ministry of Interior, showed over 40,000 opium addicts when the population was only three million. During the eight years of resistance against Japan, the enemy implemented a policy of poisoning, so the current number is at least higher than before. Therefore, I appeal to the citizens of Shanghai to jointly assist the government in eradicating opium. The Shanghai Municipal Council should lead and promote this work. Municipal councils in Beiping and Tianjin have all organized anti-drug groups, and it is hoped that Shanghai will have a similar organization. Otherwise, we hope to mobilize this work as much as possible. Afterwards, various council members offered opinions to Director Fang. Director Fang supplemented the report, stating that the police bureau has been working hard on the final opium suppression efforts, strictly investigating drug traffickers, and strengthening export investigations. It was reported that foreign ships sailing from Shanghai to Manila were also found to be carrying opium, morphine, and other drugs. Other measures being taken include summoning lower-level detectives to conduct investigations and using police dogs for sniffing.</p>
<h3>Five Measures Passed for Opium and Drug Suppression Work</h3>
<p>Finally, the conference discussed a proposal submitted for deliberation, the subject of which was to request the municipal government to strengthen opium and drug suppression work, and to destroy the seized drugs monthly by burning them to prevent malfeasance. The resolution passed five measures: (1) Thoroughly investigate the source and destination of drugs, preventing military and police protection and bribery. (2) Drugs seized by all levels of agencies, regardless of the quantity, should be publicly announced monthly for their use, and burned publicly in a centralized manner to avoid long-term corruption and demonstrate integrity. (3) In addition to citizens voluntarily reporting crimes, all bureaus and police officers should be strictly ordered to enforce inspections. (4) Informants must be rewarded with bonuses, which should be designated by the municipal government. (5) The standards for reporting crimes should be relaxed, and false accusers must be punished in turn. The meeting adjourned at six o'clock.</p>

<h3>Various Organizations Hold Tea Party to Welcome Chairman Fang</h3>

It also hopes that the leaders of the Communist Party and other parties in Shanghai will promptly send representatives to the capital to discuss national affairs together.</p>

<h3>Gang Fight Over Pier: Assault Charges Withdrawn; Nine Defendants Tried Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Third Criminal Court of the District Court heard a gang fight case yesterday afternoon. The luggage and cargo handling at the Dada Pier in this city was originally contracted by foreman Zhang Changsong. In March of this year, another foreman, Zhang Jinding, also submitted an application to the authorities, intending to operate at the Dada Pier. The pier workers have deep-seated prejudices and absolutely do not allow outsiders to join. Knowing that it would not be easy to enter the workplace, Zhang Jinding invited Inspector Wang Renxun of the 8th Brigade of the Traffic Police on April 1, leading officers Zhou Yuan, Zhang Bin, Zhang Tianxi, Li Lyun, Xu Yongmei, Liang Guoneng of the 1st Battalion and 2nd Company, armed with live ammunition, and gathered dozens of laborers including Bao Adang, to attack at 9:00 AM, intending to seize the pier by force. Zhang Changsong had also received the news earlier and gathered dozens of his subordinates to stand guard. The two sides clashed, leading to a gang fight with wooden sticks and iron rulers. Wang Renxun and others even opened fire, and nearby military police rushed to suppress the situation and disarmed the traffic police Wang Renxun and others. Ten laborers including Wang Acai, Zhu Shunshi, Li Ruchun, Yang Chun, and Yan Shengmei, as well as passersby Tao Fojiu and Tang Hanlin, were injured on the spot. Twenty-six laborers from both sides who participated in the fight and the masterminds Zhang Jinding and Zhang Changsong were all arrested on the spot and handed over to the Garrison Headquarters by the police station. Because the traffic police were not active soldiers, they were all transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office, where the prosecutor charged them with attempted murder, assault, and disturbing order. During the trial yesterday, all seven traffic police officers denied intentionally participating in the gang fight, claiming that they were chasing a deserter and accidentally got caught in the fight. All twenty-six defendants also appeared in court. With the consent of both parties, the assault charges were withdrawn; the trial for the seven traffic police officers and two foremen on the charge of disturbing order is scheduled for sentencing on the morning of the 19th.</p>

<h3>Miss Panda Gracefully Arrives in Shanghai; Long Journey Leaves Her Weary; Far From Her Home, She is Melancholy and Unhappy; Transfers to Flight to the United States the Day After Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Miss Panda, who will be traveling to the United States on the 18th, arrived in Shanghai from Chongqing by China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) flight at 3:30 PM yesterday. Section Chief Zhang Pengren of the Sichuan Provincial Department of Education is escorting her. From Chengdu to Chongqing to Shanghai, Miss Panda, who has been confined to a wooden cage, is weary from the long air flight, and her countenance appears quite haggard. Miss Panda is less than one year old and was recently captured in Wenchuan. Her mother was shot dead. Since leaving her home of lush bamboo forests, she has been melancholy and unhappy, silently hanging her head all day long. She has also been suffering from a minor illness in recent days. She was given several injections and medication before coming to Shanghai. Her right leg was unfortunately injured by a hunter and is being treated. This panda has fur that is half black and half white, with black circles around her eyes, a slightly pointed mouth, narrow eyes, and long, fluffy fur. She weighs over fifty pounds and is over three feet tall when standing. She is extremely shy around people. This is the eighth panda to be captured. The pandas previously gifted to the United States by our government unfortunately died young. Now, this rare treasure is once again being gifted to the United States. The American side has sent a medical officer, Sidney, to accompany her along the way to the United States. The Bronn Zoo in New York has been specially designated as Miss Panda's boudoir, and Dr. Dwyre has been assigned to take care of her daily life. Dr. Dwyre has already researched everything about pandas. Apart from fresh bamboo shoots, pandas do not eat other food. The American side has prepared everything according to the needs of the panda. This small animal, whose "value has increased tenfold after ascending the dragon gate," is scheduled to fly to the United States on the 18th aboard a transport plane from Far East Air Transport. After arriving in Shanghai, she will be staying at the Hongkou Slaughterhouse. Her transportation fee from Chongqing to Shanghai amounts to 60,936,000 yuan, which is more expensive than a passenger ticket.</p>

<h3>Leader of the First Comfort Mission for Wounded Soldiers, Deng Wenyi, Receives Reporters; Explains Various Points of Comfort, Conscription, Reorganization, and Compensation</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The News Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense and the First Comfort Mission for Wounded Soldiers hosted reporters yesterday at the New Life Club. General Deng Wenyi, Director of the Bureau and Leader of the First Mission, reported on the work of the News Bureau, the situation of wounded and sick officers and soldiers, comfort efforts, conscription, demobilized officers and soldiers, and compensation for the wounded and dead.</p>
<h3>Establishment of the News Bureau</h3>
<p>General Deng stated: The News Bureau has been established for three months, and there are three main areas of responsibility: (1) All reports and educational affairs related to the military; (2) Military legislation and liaison; (3) Establishing relationships with society. Deng said that the bureau has been tasked with collecting, organizing, and analyzing national and even global public opinion on military affairs in our country, and then submitting it to various officials for reference as soon as possible, and printing it into booklets for distribution to middle and upper-level military officers across the country. At the same time, it is responsible for releasing various military-related information. The bureau's agencies include: (1) The Military News Agency, which was established on Double Ten Day and will establish a branch in Shanghai no later than next month; (2) The Youth Military Publishing House—which will continue to publish various military publications.</p>
<h3>Organization of Four Missions for Separate Comfort</h3>
<p>Regarding the issue of comforting wounded soldiers, during the eight years of resistance against Japan, the casualties among national army officers and soldiers were extremely heavy. There were still 100,000 wounded at the time of victory. As of last month, there were still 70,000. The Chairman expressed deep concern and has conducted three or more comfort activities. Recently, the Ministry of National Defense has established four comfort missions to conduct comfort activities and to inspect hospital facilities and the living conditions of wounded soldiers. The first mission is responsible for Nanjing, Shanghai, Hangzhou, Fujian, Northern Jiangsu, Northern Anhui, Southern Shandong, and the Jiaoji area; the second mission is responsible for Wuhan, Zhengzhou, and Xi'an; the third mission is responsible for Hebei and Shanxi; the fourth mission is responsible for Northeast China. They began departing since Double Ten Day.</p>
<p>General Deng personally leads the first mission and has been in Shanghai for three days, inspecting three wounded soldier hospitals and one branch hospital in the city, accommodating approximately 2,000 wounded and sick officers and soldiers, with officers accounting for approximately 5%. Generally speaking, the living conditions are still good. He brought some comfort money and comfort goods, each person receiving a small bag of rations, a set of cotton shirts and trousers, a pair of shoes and socks, a towel, and several booklets. In addition, they each received comfort money ranging from 5,000 to 50,000 yuan. He deeply hopes that the public can also be encouraged to act bravely and generously contribute to comfort the heroic soldiers.</p>
<h3>Regarding Reorganization</h3>
<p>The National Army has been reduced from fifty-nine armies to fifty-nine divisions, and 160,000 officers have been demobilized. They have either retired or been reorganized into the reserves. Due to the failure to implement the military reorganization plan and the ceasefire agreement, they have not been able to change their professions. It is hoped that a solution can be found in three to six months. These veterans have survived hundreds of battles, and it is hoped that society can give them sympathy and comfort.</p>
<h3>Conscription Aspect</h3>
<p>The Military Service Law has now been passed and has been implemented since Double Ten Day. The conscription system is the foundation of a nation. Any country must establish a military service system before it can form an army. In the past, due to insufficient preparation, there may have been malpractices in conscription. Efforts should be made to improve this in the future, striving to obtain one to two million well-trained soldiers within a year and a half. However, conscription must strive for fairness, and the treatment and clothing of new recruits must also be improved.</p>
<h3>Compensation Paid for Fallen Soldiers</h3>
<p>As for the wounded and dead soldiers, the statistics during the eight years of resistance against Japan are not accurate, but it is estimated that there are 3 million people. However, the Ministry of National Defense only has records for less than 500,000 people. Most of them already have families, and the living conditions of orphans and widows are the responsibility of those who have not died. The Ministry of National Defense's Compensation Office has recently registered only 50,000 people, perhaps due to the relatively complicated registration procedures. Therefore, it has now been improved. As long as it is proven that they have indeed died, compensation will be paid. The family can receive hundreds of thousands of yuan per year, as well as rice and grain subsidies. Anyone related to fallen soldiers should fulfill their responsibility to rescue the dying and heal the wounded, publicize it widely, and report to the Ministry of National Defense to console the heroic souls in the afterlife. If this matter can be properly resolved, then in the event of national crisis, it can inspire future generations, which is of great importance, and the media should publicize it widely.</p>
<h3>National Unification Is the Beginning of Peace</h3>
<p>After Director Deng finished speaking, someone in the audience requested Deng to express his opinion on the overall situation in his capacity as spokesperson for the Ministry of National Defense. Deng modestly stated that he was originally a military reporter and would like to make an observation from the standpoint of a reporter. He then stated: The National Army truly hopes for national unification at an early date and does not want to see war again. However, since the publication of the military reorganization plan in January, the Communist Party has consistently failed to understand the government's painstaking efforts to resolve the situation politically, which is regrettable. After the second ceasefire order was issued on June 7, the National Army was in a position of being beaten passively. In the recent two or three months, the Communist Army's mobilization order was issued, and "cleansing" and "struggle" were carried out everywhere, and the people have suffered greatly, which is intolerable. Therefore, the National Army launched a counterattack to save the people from fire and water, because transportation could not be restored, and the people could not survive. However, "fighting leads to understanding," and the Communist Army should now know the strength of the National Army today. However, the National Army only seeks the nationalization of the army, and if the military reorganization plan can be implemented, the National Army has no intention of fighting. The country must be unified before there can be peace. I firmly believe that if the military service law can be implemented and transportation can be restored, then military conflict may also stop.</p>

<h3>The Concubine of Wang Qiusheng of Dachang Was Shot to Death by Her Paramour in the Middle of the Night</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Wang Qiusheng, a well-known figure in Dachang Township, was killed and beheaded during the War of Resistance Against Japan. His concubine, Si Jindi (a local, 24 years old), was restless. This spring, she had an affair with a soldier surnamed Liu stationed in a certain team in Dachang and began living with him. They opened the Shuanglongchun Restaurant in the western market of the town. Last month, they hired Wang Hua, an 18-year-old girl, as a hostess. The three lived together in the store. On the third day of this month, for unknown reasons, Si Jindi was suddenly shot in the left lower abdomen, which pierced her back. Liu used a car to rush her to the Shanghai Municipal Fifth Hospital for treatment. Because the shooting occurred in the middle of the night, the neighbors were all fast asleep and did not know the situation. She died in the hospital on the 13th due to her injuries. Her father, Si Jintao, took the body back for burial and reported the situation to the police station for investigation. Liu had already fled. The military and police authorities are currently searching for him.</p>

He wanted to return to Minhou and asked to borrow 70,000 to 80,000 yuan for travel expenses. Squadron leader Yang suspected that Lin's words were inconsistent and questioned him in detail. Finding many doubts, he sent Lin to the police station. It was learned that Lin Shouzhen was the murderer who shot Tian Cunliang.

<h3>### Pu Yi's Sister-in-Law, Saga Hiro, Captured After Fleeing from Tonghua to Linjiang: Imperial Dreams Shattered, Priceless Treasures Lost, Bitterly Recounts the Past</h3>
<p>The Northeast Supervisory Group of the War Crimes Processing Commission was ordered to go to the Northeast to supervise the repatriation of Japanese prisoners and the processing of war criminals. On September 16 of this year, Wu Boxiang, a member of the group, arrested Saga Hirohime (37 years old), the Japanese wife of Pu Jie, brother of the puppet emperor Pu Yi, and her seven-year-old daughter at the Japanese concentration camp in Jinzhou. They were transferred to Shanghai via Ping and will be escorted to the capital for prosecution in the coming days. A reporter from the Central News Agency interviewed Saga yesterday morning. This descendant of the royal family, now a prisoner, recounted the past with shame and grief.</p>
<p>Pu Yi, the puppet emperor of Manchuria, and his brother Pu Jie, as well as the second, third, and fifth princesses (meaning Manchu sisters), shared the same mother. There were also the sixth and seventh princesses, born to another mother, who currently reside in Peiping with Pu Yi's father, Prince Chun. Pu Yi and others resided in Changchun, which was called the "New Capital." Previously, because Empress Qiuhong (Japanese) of Pu Yi had no offspring, the Japanese wanted to repeat the history of Korea in the puppet state of Manchuria. Therefore, they pressured Pu Yi to promulgate the Imperial Succession Law on March 1, 1937. On April 3 of the same year, with Honjo Shigeru, commander of the Japanese Kwantung Army and chief culprit of the September 18 Incident, as matchmaker, Saga Hiro, daughter of Marquis Saga Saneto of Japan, was married to Pu Jie. The intention was to have Pu Jie's son inherit the puppet throne of Manchuria in the future. However, two daughters were born after the marriage. The elder daughter, Guisheng, is currently in Tokyo. The younger daughter, *Sheng*, is the one who was arrested this time. Fortunately, with the victory of the War of Resistance, the Japanese conspiracy dissolved into nothing. It is said that Saga speaks fluent Mandarin, but she did not use Mandarin when interviewed by the reporter. Yesterday, Saga wore a black cheongsam, a green wool short jacket, and yellow leather shoes. Her hair was styled in the modern fashion of contemporary women. If not for her thick legs, one would not suspect her of being a Japanese woman at first glance. Her maid also wore a blue cheongsam. However, Saga's face was thin and her expression was rather haggard, revealing a hint of reluctance, as she did not forget her status as a "princess."</p>
<p>The Experience of Being Captured</p>
<p>According to Saga, on August 10, the day after Japan's surrender, Pu Yi led his brother Pu Jie, the empress, concubines, and palace attendants to Tonghua to seek refuge. Pu Yi and his brother Pu Jie planned to fly to Japan. However, because the plane in Tonghua was small and did not have much fuel, they took a plane to Shenyang, preparing to change planes to go to Japan. However, when changing planes in Shenyang, they were captured by the Soviet army. At this time, Saga and Empress Qiuhong heard the news and left Tonghua for Linjiang in the east, attempting to go to Japan via Korea. Before long, the Communist army captured Linjiang, and Saga and others were arrested. Several boxes of rare treasures that Pu Yi and others were carrying were all looted by the Communist army. At this point, Saga boasted about the many royal treasures. According to her, most of the treasures in the palace were left in Changchun and taken away by the Soviet army. Those carried by Pu Yi were all rare items. She firmly believed that each type of treasure was the only one of its kind in the world. However, when the Communist army looted them, her servants hid a small amount of money in their pillows, so they were spared. But two weeks later, the Communist army came twice, and even the small amount of money hidden in the pillows was swept away. At the same time, Pu Yi's Empress Qiuhong was imprisoned in an iron cage by the Communist army, subjected to ridicule and abuse. In addition, Qiuhong had always had a hibiscus addiction. The "generation of empresses" suffered humiliation and soon died. The palace attendants who accompanied them fled one after another. Saga and her daughter, along with the second, third, and fifth princesses, were taken to Harbin.</p>
<p>Skilled in Disguise</p>
<p>After arriving in Harbin, Saga disguised herself as a Japanese resident, changed her name to Hamaguchi, and hired Kumamoto Masakimi as a servant, living in seclusion. A month ago, after Li Lisan of the Communist side went to Changchun to exchange views on the repatriation of Japanese residents, Saga and her daughter were mixed in among them, attempting to return to Japan. The general Japanese prisoners along the way knew that they were members of the royal family and did their best to cover them up. Although the Northeast Supervisory Group of the War Crimes Processing Commission had Saga's wedding photos, they were unable to identify her due to her skillful disguise. Finally, they learned of her whereabouts in a certain room in the Jinzhou concentration camp, so they led troops to the area. Although they were hidden by senior Japanese prisoner officials, they finally discovered the truth and arrested them. After Saga was taken to Peiping, she requested to visit her father-in-law at Prince Chun's residence. After being granted permission, she was accompanied by Wu Boxiang, a member of the group. After being taken to Shanghai, she wrote the words "I am the sister-in-law of Emperor Pu Yi" to demand improved meals because she was dissatisfied with the food.</p>
<h3>All Unapproved Radio Stations Must Immediately Cease Broadcasting</h3>
<p>All public broadcasting stations in this city were previously convened for a meeting by the Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau of the Ministry of Communications. It was resolved that all radio stations should, before October 15, follow the procedures for applying for a public radio station and submit their applications to the competent authorities for approval by the Ministry of Communications (i.e., obtain an order from the Ministry of Communications approving the establishment). If the approval order from the Ministry of Communications has not been received by the deadline, it will be considered as having no legal basis and should automatically cease broadcasting from this date. Otherwise, the Telecommunications Bureau will immediately cooperate with the Songhu Garrison Headquarters and the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau to enforce the cessation of broadcasting. It is now verified that the deadline has passed, and it is heard that the Telecommunications Bureau is handling the execution procedures with the relevant authorities.</p>
<h3>Municipal Government's Materials Receiving Office to Close at the End of This Month</h3>
<p>According to Xie Haoling, director of the Municipal Government's Materials Receiving and Management Office, the office's operations are scheduled to end at the end of this month. After the closure, all unfinished business will be transferred to the Bureau for the Management of Enemy and Puppet Assets. After the office closes, Xie will devote himself to his position as Secretary-General of the Port Affairs Committee.</p>
<h3>National Products Exhibition Opens Yesterday Morning: Promoting Production and Advocating Simplicity</h3>
<p>[This newspaper's report] The National Products Exhibition Market, sponsored by the Shanghai Branch of the China Production Promotion Association and supported by four organizations, including the National Products Factory Federation, the Machine-Made Factory Federation, the Shanghai Branch of the National Industry Association, and the Patriotic Products Association, held its opening ceremony at 444 Nanjing West Road at 10:00 a.m. yesterday. At the entrance of the venue, dozens of large and small national flags were hung, adorned with red, white, and blue bunting. The walls were decorated with strings of colorful small light bulbs and the words "Using National Products is Most Glorious," as well as a large oil painting of Chairman Chiang. Mayor Wu personally attended the opening ceremony on time yesterday morning, and Mrs. Mao Shengdong cut the ribbon. The ceremony was held in the tea room of the market, with approximately 300 attendees, including Fang Zhi, Wu Kaixian, Shui Xiangyun, Wang Xiaolai, Xie Haoling, and Zhang Xiaosong.</p>
<p>Chairman Mao Qingxiang was absent due to illness and was replaced by Zhang Zilian, who briefly stated: "The Production Promotion Association was established during the War of Resistance, with the purpose of promoting production and developing China's economy. Using national products is the glory of the nation. We hope that the Chinese people will use more national products in the future to promote production." Mayor Wu then delivered a speech, saying: "I have three hopes for the national products market: (1) Investors must improve technology, implement scientific management, and strive for excellence in their products. (2) Workers should endure hardship and work hard, strengthen work efficiency, and cooperate closely with investors. (3) I hope that national products exhibitions can penetrate the countryside so that the masses in the interior can adopt them, and then the future of national products will be limitless." Fang Zhi, director of the Municipal Party Headquarters, said that what China needs most at present is to solve the people's livelihood problems. He hoped that people in the industrial and commercial sectors would work hard to develop industry, overthrow bureaucratic capitalism, and prevent industrial development from being affected by unexpected blows. They should also find ways to guide idle capital to engage in production and construction. Hu Boxiang, a representative of the manufacturers, delivered a reply, encouraging his colleagues not to be selfish and self-serving, but to take the entire nation as their premise and work together as one. Finally, Wang Xiaolai delivered a speech, reiterating the slogan of "promoting national products" before the War of Resistance, and said that China is an agricultural country. National products are all agricultural products, and promoting national products is to support agriculture. China has always admired simplicity. National products are all simple, and we should not be attracted by "beauty." We should advocate simplicity and avoid "beauty." The opening ceremony was completed in music at 11:00 a.m.</p>

<p>Liu Zhi, former director of the Zhengzhou Pacification Headquarters and current member of the Strategic Advisory Committee of the Ministry of National Defense, arrived in Shanghai from the capital by night train last night and will arrive this morning.</p>
<h3>Vanishing Vessel of the Administrative Yuan's Water Transport Team: Iraqi Marine Engineer Suspected and Accused</h3>
<p>[This newspaper's report] A small steamship named Wanquan, belonging to the Water Transport Brigade of the Shanghai Branch of the Administrative Yuan, suddenly disappeared on September 15 of this year. After investigation by the brigade in various aspects, it was learned that Li Weisan, an Iraqi marine engineer on the ship, was highly suspected. Dong Wennuofu, the legal representative of the brigade, filed a lawsuit with the court. Yesterday morning, the court held a hearing on the case. Witnesses Lin Agou and Lu Asan both testified that the defendant had indeed stolen the ship. The defendant claimed: Agou and Asan have a grudge against the defendant, and I did not steal the ship. The court adjourned the hearing and postponed the trial. The defendant was released on bail.</p>
<h3>The O'Hara Agency Espionage Case: Italian Radio Operator Testifies in Court, Confesses to Intercepting Aircraft Intelligence Within Chinese Territory</h3>
<p>[This newspaper's report] The person who testified in court yesterday in the O'Hara Agency espionage case was an Italian named Montovani. This person was one of the radio operators hired by the O'Hara Agency around the time of Germany's surrender.</p>
<p>Montovani said: After Germany's surrender, the O'Hara Agency continued to hire Italian radio operators and used Goebbels-style propaganda methods to express concern for Italy and induce them to continue working. Before May 8, 1945, his job was to record broadcasts from foreign radio stations and intercept communications from China Airlines regarding the movements of aircraft within Chinese territory. In addition, he searched for British and American underground radio stations in Annam. When the news of Germany's surrender came, he immediately left the agency and worked as a waiter at a hotel. But in June 1945, Laski, one of the defendants, came to him and said that there was work to do, instructing him to visit O'Hara, the person in charge, at the agency on Xiaoshadu Road.</p>
<p>O'Hara explained to him that the agency had restarted its operations and strongly emphasized the Germans' concern for Italy and persuaded him to continue working.</p>
<p>After that, three other Italians joined the O'Hara Agency with him, but their work was limited to receiving TASS news reports. At that time, the monthly salary was 400,000 yuan in puppet currency.</p>
<p>After Montovani's testimony, Colonel Bao Ding, the defendant's lawyer, stood up and said that the salaries of these Italian radio operators were paid by Japanese officials, and they also received flour rations from the Japanese authorities, so they could not have been hired by the O'Hara Agency. However, Prosecutor Dewey presented a rebuttal, which was the confession of Kengo, an accountant of the former Japanese military department in Shanghai, proving that he had paid money to the O'Hara Agency through a Japanese liaison officer, and that the amount paid after Germany's surrender had increased.</p>

<h3>Letters</h3>
<p>To the editor: I am writing to inform you that the news item in the local news section on page 5 of the second section of your newspaper on October 15 regarding the Yu Ying warehouse robbery on a rainy night, in which a member of the water police was said to have obtained stolen goods and three colleagues were also detained, is not consistent with the facts. According to this sub-bureau's file number 10610, police officer Ju Shixian asked for leave but left without permission and went to work at the Hongkou Daye Printing Factory. He was arrested and detained by this sub-bureau and was not as your newspaper reported. As for the three police officers Wang Kaiyuan, Liu Jiyuan, and Xu Haishan, they are suspected of accepting bribes from small cargo businesses. This sub-bureau discovered the evidence, reported it to the higher authorities, and has punished them. The relationship between this case and the case solved by the Penglai Road sub-bureau is still under investigation. We hereby request a correction. Sincerely, Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau, Water Police Sub-bureau. We have verified that the news item in your newspaper about the closure of this office at the end of the month is not consistent with the facts. We hereby request verification and correction. Sincerely, German Property Clearing Office, Bureau for the Management of Enemy and Puppet Assets, Su Zhe District.</p>
<h3>Tax Evasion: A Few Tricks in the Entertainment, Wine, and Food Industry</h3>
<p>This is old news from the enemy-puppet era, but it is impossible to guarantee that it does not still exist today.</p>
<p>[Special Feature by This Newspaper] This is not the exposure of corruption where someone has been caught red-handed with stolen goods. I have collected some information from various sources, simply to illustrate that although Shanghai has a huge amount of tax revenue, not every penny goes to the municipal treasury. What I am describing here is old news – old news that everyone notices but no one mentions. The reason I am not saying anything new is because I do not have sufficient evidence and am afraid of legal liability.</p>
<p>During the period when Shanghai was under occupation, tax evasion became a very common phenomenon. What I want to talk about here are theaters, dance halls, cafes, and restaurants. Because these places have a large number of consumers every day, a large amount of tax revenue every day, and also a large amount of leakage.</p>
<p>Old-Style Restaurants</p>
<p>The puppet Finance Bureau had the most trouble with the taxes of old-style restaurants. They had no accounting system. They used a trust-based ledger, simply making a simple entry in the ledger when something was sold. Besides that, there was nothing else. The puppet Finance Bureau had no authority to tell them to hire an accountant. If they recorded less in the ledger, the leakage of taxes would be remarkably considerable. For example, when a regular customer finished eating and the waiter brought the bill, he would always smile and flatter the guest, saying, "I didn't write the tax on for you," so that the guest would generously use that tax as an extra tip. If that customer had a gun, he would definitely say aggressively, "Damn it, do I need to pay taxes too?" Naturally, the cost of this shouting was tax exemption. But the boss would not take the exempt tax out of his own pocket. The way to make up for it was, of course, to record less in the ledger. Since the ledger could record less by one entry, less by two entries, less by three entries, all the way to countless entries, what did it matter? But too much greed was still dangerous. When the whole room was full of people and the smell of alcohol, the sudden arrival of the tax inspector would reveal many loopholes. If the bill for that room exceeded the total income of any day in the ledger, it would be enough to show that the past business reports were completely unreliable. As a result, fines and suspensions followed. I remember that the fine was so large once that even selling the restaurant would not be enough to cover it. Naturally, that restaurant had to close.</p>
<p>Cafes</p>
<p>Cafe managers, in order to prevent embezzlement by employees, mostly established very strict accounting systems. All kinds of ledgers and receipts were available. This undoubtedly gave the tax inspectors a lot of convenience. But they still used their ingenuity to find ways to evade taxes. Although those triplicate receipts with page numbers made them feel hampered, they did not give up this unexpected gain. One cafe, constrained by the triplicate sales receipts with printed page numbers, specially hired a female employee to write out separately printed triplicate receipts every day, just like the official ones. These had the date, the name of the item, and the price. The manager instructed her to write more things below the tax-free price limit, such as a cup of black tea or a cup of coffee. She kept writing until the projected daily total revenue was reached. In addition, this female employee had to do some of the simplest purchasing, sales, and expense accounts. Throughout her office hours, this female employee occupied the accounting room alone. The other accountants worked in rented rooms outside. When the tax inspectors came, this female employee would deal with them. If they asked, "Why is the account so simple?" the answer was, "Business is bad, and we have few people." When they asked more carefully, she would say, "The accountant has gone out, and I don't know much about it." In this way, the tax inspectors would match up the figures slightly, stamp a "Checked" seal on the ledger, and leave. As for the cafe, its daily income from tax evasion far exceeded its operating profits. But the second time, when two other tax inspectors arrived, they caught the loophole. It turned out that the manager was too greedy. He thought that since the tax inspectors had already come, he did not need to be too serious about writing fake sales invoices. He meant that too much paper would be wasted. He said, "The tax inspectors get a headache when they see a large pile of triplicate receipts. Who would look at each one carefully?" The tax inspectors questioned the small number of business units. Then he went to the cashier's counter and looked at the bills for the day. What had been made in half a day had already exceeded the total amount of previous days by a lot. On closer inspection, he found that the page numbers were far apart. The female employee explained, "Business is particularly good today... I just grabbed the bills and used them randomly, and didn't pay attention to the page numbers at all." After the tax inspectors left, the manager immediately went to the puppet Finance Bureau to find someone to smooth things over. Although he was punished later, the punishment was very light. This "smoothing over" obviously played a role.</p>
<p>Theaters</p>
<p>Among the theaters, Peking opera theaters evaded taxes the most severely. At first, the puppet Finance Bureau was careless. They sold the tickets and then took them back before the show ended. At the end of the month, they simply reported a little to the puppet Finance Bureau. Secondly, the manager pocketed all the donation collected from the complimentary tickets. Later, because the tax revenue was low, the puppet Finance Bureau changed the method. The tickets for each row of seats were bound into a book. The tickets had to be stamped at the puppet Finance Bureau; tearing off the ticket was considered selling it; the ticket had to be torn into three sections. When paying the tax, the ticket stubs had to be brought. This method was indeed very strict, and it was also implemented very strictly. People often went to the theater to inspect the taxes. This made the managers feel very panicked, so they sent a representative secretly to the puppet Finance Bureau to make connections. The purpose, of course, was to smooth things over. Although people still came to the theaters to inspect the taxes later, the managers were no longer worried. It is said that this "connection" was very broad, including those who stamped and counted ticket stubs.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, people always hate taxes. However, managers were an exception. They were supporters of taxes for the following reasons: (1) evading a portion of the taxes, (2) completely embezzling the complimentary ticket tax, and (3) delaying payment for three months, using this as capital for high-interest loans.</p>
<p>But for some reason, a very large Peking opera theater was found to have evaded taxes and was punished.</p>
<p>Dance Halls</p>
<p>The organization of dance halls was chaotic, and the managers took advantage of this to make a fortune by evading taxes on a large scale. The tea bill was a small amount, so it didn't matter much. The dance ticket was a large amount, so they used tricks.</p>
<p>The trick was very simple. After the dance guests bought dance tickets for the dancers, they would go to the accounting room to exchange them for cash, and then the accounting room would resell those dance tickets. But after several strict inspections, they also established a "connection" with the puppet Finance Bureau.</p>
<p>Another type of tax evasion that could never be solved was when some regular dance guests, in order to ingratiate themselves with their favorites, directly handed cash to the dancers. This not only evaded the tax but also avoided exploitation by the boss.</p>
<p>What is said above is only a small part of the various types of tax evasion. I am not saying that these phenomena still exist now, but I cannot guarantee that they do not exist.</p>

<h3>Reader Replies: Medicine and Hygiene</h3>
<p>(1) New Lung Treatment Drug</p>
<p>Lu Liangmin and Wang Mingfeng ask: We read in your esteemed newspaper about the China Enterprise Company selling the American lung disease specific drug, Streptomycin. A friend of ours has suffered from lung disease for many years and has not responded to various treatments. We wonder if this drug is effective for this disease? We have two questions and request your answer: (1) Are major hospitals and doctors in Shanghai already using this drug clinically? (2) Can this drug truly cure tuberculosis?</p>
<p>[Dr. Zhang Zhongming's Answer] Streptomycin is similar to penicillin and is a type of antitoxin produced by bacterial culture. Animal experiments have shown that it can effectively kill tuberculosis bacteria. However, its absolute effectiveness on human tuberculosis has not yet been documented. This drug is already available on the American market, but there is no stock in Shanghai, and major hospitals and doctors have not yet used it clinically. Therefore, I cannot determine its effectiveness.</p>
<p>(2) Postpartum Weakness</p>
<p>Wang Yiwen asks: After I stopped breastfeeding last August, I suffered from irregular menstruation and very little menstrual flow. Recently, I have often felt numbness in my hands and feet, and I have many restless dreams at night. However, my body has become fatter than before. Although I have consulted both Chinese and Western doctors, I have not seen any improvement. The cost of medical treatment is very high, and I cannot afford it. I don't know what disease I have. Please advise on treatment methods.</p>
<p>[Dr. Zhang Zhongming's Answer] Your condition requires a gynecological examination to determine the cause. Injections of ovarian preparations may be effective.</p>
<p>(3) Left Leg Cramps</p>
<p>Zhang Honglun asks: I am 21 years old and still healthy. I had meningitis as a child, and now my right leg is slightly lame. However, my movements are normal and not inconvenient. I was previously injured in a car accident and my left leg has healed. However, since the injury to my left leg healed, it has often twitched when I am asleep (for more than three years), but I am not aware of it. It stops when I wake up, and the twitching is very frequent. Is there any way to treat it? (1) Is it related to meningitis? (2) Is electrotherapy effective?</p>
<p>[Dr. Zhang Zhongming's Answer] The involuntary movement of your left leg is caused by nerve stimulation. Vitamin B1 and phosphate preparations should be injected. It may be related to meningitis. Electrotherapy can also be tried.</p>

<h3>Beneficiaries of Emergency Relief Fund: Poor Child with Broken Leg, Apprentice with Appendicitis, Out of Danger After Emergency Treatment</h3>
<p>Chen Fumei, a 6-year-old girl from Ningbo, comes from a poor family who make a living by rowing boats. They live at No. 12 Xiaoben Lane, Gongping Road. On the 11th of this month, she was knocked down by a bicycle and broke her leg. She was found lying on the roadside by a neighbor and taken to Gongji Hospital for treatment. After the Baojia chief and hospital staff investigated and confirmed the facts, they approved the issuance of a subsidy, and she was cured.</p>
<p>Shen Tianbao, a new apprentice at the Dahua Silk Weaving and Printing Factory at No. 66 Tianbao Lane, Ningbo Road, is from Jiujiang, Jiangxi. He had only been an apprentice for four days when he suddenly suffered from acute appendicitis. Because he came from a poor family and his parents were deceased, neighbors collected 150,000 yuan to send him to Gongji Hospital. After investigation, he was found to be unable to continue paying for medical expenses, and a request for a subsidy was approved, and he has recovered.</p>

<h3>Wu, Concurrent Chairman of the Textile Control Committee, Takes Office This Morning; Deadline for Southbound Sales Applications is Tomorrow Afternoon</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Mayor Wu of this city, who also serves as the Chairman of the Textile Industry Management Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, is scheduled to go to the Committee's office on Jiangxi Road this morning to formally assume his duties, but no ceremony will be held. The former Concurrent Chairman, Shu Yunzhang, remains a member of the Committee. In addition, Lin Fengbao, Director of the Business Bureau of the Central Bank, has been appointed as a member. All other Deputy Chairmen, Li Shengbo, and committee members remain unchanged. There have been no reports of any internal personnel changes. However, the internal staff has been busy rushing to complete the handover procedures in recent days.</p>
<p>Furthermore, since the Committee began accepting applications from various cotton cloth manufacturers for the registration of cotton cloth sales to the south on the 11th, 410 transport operators and 178 manufacturers had gone to the Committee to obtain application forms for registration as of yesterday. According to Mr. Liu Wenteng, Director of the Business Department of the Committee, the deadline for obtaining application forms for registration will be 5:00 PM tomorrow (the 17th). Manufacturers who have obtained application forms for registration are requested to submit the completed application forms to the Committee before the 20th for collation and review. Applications submitted after this deadline will be reviewed next month. After the new Chairman takes office, investigators will be dispatched to conduct a detailed review based on the submitted application forms for registration. It is hoped that this review work will be completed before the 25th, so that the qualifications of the manufacturers can be verified and applications for the sale of cotton cloth to the south can be accepted.</p>
<p>Also, according to the "Provisional Administrative Measures for the Export of Cotton Cloth to South China" and the "Simplified Rules for the Examination and Approval of Applications for the Export of Cotton Cloth to South China," the sale of cotton cloth to the south in this city requires the selling manufacturer to apply for quota allocation and export permits from the Textile Industry Management Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs. After obtaining the export permit, the goods must be declared to customs within ten days, otherwise the permit will be void. The Jianghai Customs Office formally issued a notice to merchants yesterday.</p>
<h3>Securities Exchange Adds After-Hours Trading Today; Settlement Time Changed to 4 PM the Next Afternoon; Brokers Who Have Not Paid for Substitute Goods Will Be Barred From the Trading Floor</h3>
<p>In order to promote the trading of Chinese stocks onto the right track, the Securities Exchange has decided, after a meeting of the Board of Directors, to add after-hours trading starting today (the 16th). Yesterday, a formal announcement was issued to all brokers and agents, and the business hours were adjusted to 9:30 AM to 12:00 PM in the morning and 2:00 PM to 3:00 PM in the afternoon. Collective reconciliation will be held at 5:00 PM in the afternoon. As for the settlement time, it has been changed to calculate the transactions of the afternoon of the same day and the morning of the next day together, and settlement procedures will be carried out at 4:00 PM in the afternoon. It is also learned that the deadline for brokers to pay the 30 million yuan substitute guarantee deposit was yesterday, and there will be no extension. Securities Exchange authorities will order all brokers who have not paid the substitute guarantee deposit to stop trading on the floor starting today. The gradual expansion of over-the-counter trading not only affects market trading but is also inconsistent with the law. The Supervision Office and the Securities Exchange authorities both regret this and are jointly drafting measures to resolutely ban it. According to a person in charge of the Securities Exchange, these measures will be announced in the short term and will severely crack down on over-the-counter trading.</p>
<h3>Floating Longs Rush to Sell Off; Market Conditions Remain Difficult to Boost</h3>
<p>Yesterday's market trading was sparse and difficult to boost. The trading floor was entirely supported by retail investors. The market rose slightly at the opening, and there were buyers, stabilizing the situation and rising slightly. After 10:45 AM, the atmosphere improved slightly, and the two major hot stocks and Sino-American Silk Textile Factory rose. The firm trend lasted for half an hour, but eventually collapsed and retreated. The floating longs were too aggressive at the start of the morning, and then gradually became sellers. In addition, there were sales from the northern capital, and the situation completely changed. The shorts then exerted their power, and there was a miserable decline near noon. As a result, the closing prices of Yong'an Textile, Mei Ya Silk Factory, and Jingfu Company all fell slightly. Xinguang Company rose slightly, while Qinxing Company remained unchanged. Tongyi, Sino-American Silk Textile Factory, Zhongfang, Rongfeng, Innerwear Company, Lilian Match, and Wuhe all fell slightly. Datong, Xinya, and Huafeng Cement rose slightly. Jinglun Silk Industry remained flat. The total turnover was 8.37 million shares. Over-the-counter stocks continued to fall. Foreign stocks were affected by the stock market near noon, and the two major hot stocks remained depressed. The process was peaceful due to the small number of transactions. As a result, Yisha, British United, and Wheelock fell slightly compared to the previous close. The rest remained stable.</p>
<h3>Bond Market Sentiment Is Low</h3>
<p>The bond market was affected by the overall trend, and sentiment was uninterested. The new longs were watching. The Unified C bond opened at 2030 yuan and rose slightly to 2120 yuan. Then, retail investors gradually closed out their positions, and the stock market fueled the selling pressure, causing the price to fall below 1900 yuan before stabilizing. As a result, it closed 150 yuan lower than the previous close. A and B also fell 120 yuan, and D and E each fell 50 yuan.</p>
<h3>High-Grade Aged Tea Is Popular; New Ningbo Black Tea Has Not Yet Reached an Agreement</h3>
<p>Green teas such as Chunzhen, Zhenmei, and Zhenmei, which are sold to Africa, have not been easy to sell this year due to their surprisingly high prices. Although aged teas have been exported, low-grade goods are not welcome. Therefore, recently, various companies have focused on high-grade aged goods. Unfortunately, due to scarcity and lack of supply, the number of transactions has not been sustained. Under the circumstances of too many monks and not enough porridge, prices have frequently risen. As a result, the price per dan has increased by about 2,000 to 3,000 yuan compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>Other high-grade black teas, such as Yingzhuang, are also highly sought after, and the market is showing a promising outlook. As for the domestic sales of black and green teas, stores in this street are still adding to their stock, but customers from various regions are still stagnant. However, sentiment remains stable. It has been found that the first batch of new Ningzhou black tea shipped to Shanghai by Zhongxin Chang Tea House is still under negotiation and has not yet opened for trading.</p>
<h3>Twenty-Three Flour Merchants Exceeded Price Limits; Social Bureau Orders Written Guarantees</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Yesterday, twenty-three flour merchants exceeded the price limits significantly at their retail outlets. The Social Bureau summoned the responsible persons of each store to the Bureau for questioning, examined their accounts, investigated the source and destination of the goods, and ordered them to provide written guarantees.</p>
<h3>Overcoat Wool Is Selling Well</h3>
<p>Overcoat wool has been selling extremely well recently. Both high-grade and low-grade goods are selling well. Ordinary goods priced at 70,000 to 80,000 yuan per yard are in the greatest demand. Water-marked wool priced at over 100,000 to 200,000 yuan is selling more actively on this street. Low-grade goods, such as Tibetan gray wool priced at 40,000 to 50,000 yuan, are selling more actively in Nanjing and Hangzhou. Standard market prices are all trending upwards, both openly and secretly, due to various environmental factors and the depletion of inventory.</p>
<h3>Promote Overseas Remittances; Price to be Settled After Remittance Arrives; Remittances to Hong Kong Can Be Paid in Hong Kong Dollars</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Bank of China has been planning to launch a scheme for exchanging original currency in order to promote overseas remittances. It has been learned that this scheme was implemented after the Double Tenth Festival. This method is slightly different from the old exchange method. That is, the amount of national currency does not need to be converted at the time of remittance, but the national currency will be settled according to the official exchange rate at the time when the remittance arrives at the paying bank at the destination. However, remittances to the Bank of China branch in Hong Kong are allowed to be settled in Hong Kong dollars. This method has recently been implemented in New York (including Canada and the United States mainland) and London (including the United Kingdom mainland). Other regions such as Southeast Asia, Cuba, and Australia have more complex currency conversions and will be implemented gradually.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Nanjing Dispatch, 15th] Since the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, overseas remittances have been pouring in from all over the world. The Bank of China, which is responsible for handling overseas remittances, is also actively seeking to reform the system in accordance with the actual situation, so as to ensure that the remittances can be sent quickly and safely. The Bank's overseas branches that have resumed operations include those in Yangon, Hanoi, Haiphong, Singapore, Penang, and Kuala Lumpur. Due to the situation in the Dutch East Indies, it has not been possible to establish branches immediately. A plan is currently being developed to restore the Batang institution first. Institutions in Surabaya and Medan will be restored when local conditions permit. In addition, Saigon is also preparing to establish a branch. In order to reduce the difficulty of transliteration and save on electricity costs, the Bank has launched an overseas Chinese telegraphic transfer registration service. As of now, 120,000 households have registered, which is convenient for overseas Chinese. (Yu)</p>
<h3>Silk Weaving Factory Registration Has Been Completed; Rayon Will Be Distributed Soon; Silk Weaving Factories in Other Areas Can Also Be Allocated Appropriately; Speculators Deliberately Raise the Price of Semi-Gloss Goods</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The registration of silk weaving factories to purchase rayon registration cards from the Central Trust Bureau was completed yesterday. However, the allocation method is subject to final approval, and it is currently difficult to determine whether it can be allocated this week. It is said that due to procedural issues, it may not be implemented until next week. Currently, representatives from other areas such as Hangzhou have come to Shanghai to request registration. The Central Trust Bureau has agreed that they can be allocated appropriately. Yesterday, representatives from other areas hosted a banquet for local industry peers at the New Capital Hotel to strengthen communication. Yesterday, the market price of rayon rose again. 120-count rayon from Tianqiao with gloss was priced at 4.45 million yuan, an increase of 200,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Semi-gloss and other types of rayon even rose by 300,000 yuan. It is rumored that the goods to be allocated by the Central Trust Bureau are all goods with gloss. Therefore, those who have the goods regard them as rare goods and deliberately raise the price. Factory operators were unmoved, and prices remained flat. Silk goods were also very idle, and the market was unchanged. Transactions were very light.</p>
<h3>Side Observations on Foreign Exchange; Official Measures Fail to Reassure; People Expect the Issuance Volume of Legal Tender</h3>
<p>[Reuters Nanjing, 14th] One week after the announcement of foreign exchange price limits, the open foreign exchange market in Nanjing remains quite volatile. In recent days, the non-official exchange rate of the US dollar has become more active, indicating that some of the measures recently taken by the authorities have failed to reassure the public. Although the daily foreign exchange transactions in the capital are not very large, roadside transactions have seen a new high price of 4,050 yuan of legal tender per US dollar. On the one hand, this may indicate that the national economy has failed to stabilize, but it is also a logical result of the price limits. The announcement of foreign exchange price limits has eliminated some foreign exchange traders, but in fact it has also created an artificial shortage of foreign exchange on the open market. Neutral observers point out that the government's delay in announcing the amount of banknotes issued has prevented the public from immediately fully trusting the current currency. An atmosphere of tense expectation still exists. The speed at which black market prices fall is often like wildfire. For example, this morning, there was a sudden sell-off of US dollars from all sides to prevent price declines, because, according to past experience, this situation can occur within a few hours. In addition, the domestic political and military situation also has some influence on the fluctuation of foreign exchange prices.</p>
<h3>Gold Prices Were Stable; US Dollar Black Market Was Small</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the price of gold was stable. It opened at 2.19 million in the morning and was very peaceful after the opening. It once fell slightly from 2.195 million, and the floating longs closed out their positions slightly, falling to 2.18 million before easing. It hovered around 2.19 million. After 10:00 AM, the central bank allocated 18 bars at a price of 2.19 million. After entering, it gradually changed from stable to slightly stable. Customer sales were still active. Near noon, it rose back to 2.213 million. At noon, it hovered around 2.21 million. In the afternoon, the price for day-after-tomorrow transactions rose to 2.22 million before leveling off. As a result, it closed 16,000 higher than the previous close. The prices of gold ornaments, silver ingots, and silver dollars were flat. The underground dismantling of silver was tight after being flat. Underground interest rates ranged from 15% to 18%.</p>
<p>Foreign currency was calm and little changed. The asking price for US dollars in the black market was 4,200 yuan to 4,300 yuan, with few transactions, slightly cheaper than the previous close.

<h3>Ranked Second in the World: Brazil's Cotton Exports Surge, Peru and Mexico Increase, India and Egypt Decline</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 14th] The Department of Agriculture recently issued a report stating that in the year ending July 31st, Brazil's cotton industry had replaced India and Egypt in the global export market, giving the Western Hemisphere a dominant position as a supplier to the world's textile industry. Although the United States remains the largest exporter, maintaining its pre-war level of 3,678,000 bales, Brazil's export trade among Latin American countries has seen a sharp increase, with exports of 1,471,000 bales, reaching second place in one fell swoop. The report stated that total global export trade is estimated at 9,038,000 bales, most of which are supplied by countries in the Western Hemisphere (especially Latin America). India, frequently facing poor harvests and with continuously increasing domestic consumption, has an export volume that is only one-tenth of its pre-war average. Egypt intends to rebuild its extensive pre-war European trade, but faces many obstacles and setbacks. India's export volume for the year ending July 31st is estimated at only 820,000 bales, a drop of one million bales compared to the pre-war average. Egypt's export volume is also said to have fallen from around 1,600,000 bales per year before the war to 860,000 bales. Peru's cotton exports have surged from 309,000 bales in 1939 to 440,000 bales, and Mexico's exports have also increased tenfold compared to the pre-war total of 26,000 bales. The report further stated that the Soviet Union, which only occasionally appeared in the export market before the war, has now become an important supplier to Eastern European countries. Although the Soviet Union's export figures are not available, sporadic reports from Eastern European countries indicate that the Soviet Union exported 50,000 bales of cotton to Hungary, Poland, Germany, Czechoslovakia, and Austria (possibly including Denmark) in the same year. The United Kingdom, a major cotton importing country, obtained most of its supply from its imperial possessions, amounting to 1,892,000 bales, of which 523,000 bales from Brazil topped all other countries. The United States supplied the United Kingdom with only 293,000 bales, but shipped 700,000 bales to China and 365,000 bales to Japan. According to the Department, the US cotton shipped to Japan is only part of the 890,000 bale delivery process by December 31st of this year.</p>

<h3>Doctoral Degree Award Case: Executive Yuan Refers It to Academia Sinica for Serious Discussion, Hu Shih and Chen Yuan Fly to Nanjing on the 18th to Attend</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] The Secretary-General of the Academia Sinica, who arrived here, said on the 14th: The doctoral degree award case to be discussed by the Academia Sinica Council is not proposed by the Ministry of Education, but referred by the Executive Yuan's routine meeting. It is heard that the government attaches great importance to this matter because of its importance, so it was referred to the Council for serious discussion. He also said that the nature of this meeting is quite important, as the future work plan of the Academia Sinica, including the development of domestic and foreign work, will be decided by this Council. The meeting will last for five days, opening on the 20th of this month, and a preparatory meeting will be held on the evening of the 15th to discuss the agenda.</p>

If the current domestic party struggle is based on national interests and can lay down arms at the same time, that is the necessary path to achieve prosperity and democracy." Chen hopes that some "good people will unite the good people in the country to form a good people's party and promote good people's politics." Chen regrets that there are too many bad people in the world and too few good people, so he believes that this is just an ideal. Chen gave an example, saying: "Buddhism advocates releasing life, but if not a single living creature is killed, the world may be filled with flies and rats. Also, if everyone imitates monks and nuns and 'leaves home,' the human race will become extinct, so the people of the country should not be pessimistic about the current transitional situation."</p>

Its style is different from that of Qunsheng. Individually, Yu Ruizhang and Tu Wenlong are active and show the demeanor of great generals. Their shooting is already quite proficient and should not be underestimated. The Giants were completely on the decline yesterday. Starting the game with a score of 4 to 20, they were inevitably discouraged, which greatly affected their shooting accuracy.</p>
<p>Zhenglun's Arrogance Soared</p>
<p>Due to the Giants' error, the game was delayed until 7:20 pm. Referees Xuan Hegao and Yu Juju. Zhenglun started with Tu Wenlong, Cai Zhongqiang, Yu Ruizhang, Zhang Gensheng, and Bing Huan. The Giants responded with Funick, Stevenson, Taublinki, Kajetmilos, and Yelong. Tu Wenlong opened the scoring, and Stevenson immediately responded, but from then on, Zhenglun displayed its power and controlled the situation. Yu Ruizhang and Tu Wenlong found the basket as if reaching into a bag, quickly leading by 12 to 2 and then by 20 to 4. The Giants were helpless. Later, the Giants repeatedly caught up, giving it their all, and narrowed the gap to 25 to 15 in the first half, with Zhenglun still in the lead. In the second half, the Giants were once at 23 to 27, but Zhenglun had plenty of stamina and continued to lead after Zhang Gensheng was substituted out and Liu Zhengjun entered the game. Although the Giants desperately counterattacked, Zhenglun's defense was tight. Until the end of the game, Zhenglun won 40 to 28, adding another masterpiece after defeating the Shan team.</p>

<h3>The Liberation of the Liberated Areas</h3>
<p>— Huaiyin Dispatch on the 5th, Special Correspondent Kang Zhou</p>
<p>On the desolate streets of Huaiyin, I walked like a hunter. My eyes swept over every house, every ruin, and every resident's face. I hoped to find a trace to prove the Communist Party's propaganda of the "liberated areas" and their "splendid" achievements. In the past week, I have traveled to many places, such as Suqian, Siyang, Huaiyin, and Huaian. These were previously the so-called "liberated areas" of the Communist Party and have been repeatedly liberated by the National Army. I stepped into these once "mysterious" areas even before the refugees eagerly awaiting their return home. What I came into contact with was the exposed truth of the "liberated areas" and the people living in that atmosphere. I saw a lot, heard even more, but I am sorry to say that the materials I obtained are the scars hidden beneath the beautiful cloak that the Communist Party deeply conceals.</p>
<p>Along the way, I didn't see a single person who looked truly human. What I saw seemed like a group of prisoners who had just been released from prison after years of confinement: disheveled hair, ashen faces, and emaciated bodies, standing in the wind as if they were about to fall over. What they wore on their bodies, if you could call it clothes, would be more accurately described as strips or patches of cloth. Only the women's trousers were patched up completely, while most of the children were naked from the waist down, or even completely naked, like pieces of charcoal. Only one thing shone in their malnourished eyes—when they leaned against the broken doors, set up dusty incense tables, and welcomed the entering National Army.</p>
<p>That day, the National Army arrived. A naked child stuck a red paper strip on the incense candles, wrote the words "Welcome the Central Army," and walked in front of the procession.</p>
<p>An old woman with white hair carried a pot of tea, walked over, and said tremblingly, "Squad leader, you've worked hard, have a cup!"</p>
<p>Almost all the people after the disaster shed tears. They said, "If you hadn't come for another year, we would have starved to death completely!"</p>
<h3>In-depth Interviews with the People: Their Hearts Sing Laments</h3>
<p>Quietly, after conducting in-depth interviews, everyone poured out their laments to me. This is truly a painful memory!</p>
<p>Last August, Japan surrendered, and the National Army had transportation difficulties. The Communist Party took the opportunity to invade and occupy most of North China. Northern Jiangsu has fertile land and has not suffered from natural disasters for many years. Those who were fortunate enough not to be bankrupted under the ravages of the enemy puppets were swept away by the storm-like "struggle" of the Communist Party. Thus, the rich struggled against the poor, and the poor struggled until they were destitute. What about the destitute? They were forced to charge into battle.</p>
<p>Last winter, a total of tens of thousands of people died from hunger and cold.</p>
<p>The signboard that the Communist Party puts up is "the people," which is a ridiculous and pleasing term. In fact, the Communist Party only has party members, not people. And the foolish party members are merely tools for the party leaders to achieve their selfish desires. Their struggle is said to have a purpose, which is "the poor turning over." The landlords' fields are seized through struggle, and the meritorious personnel who participated in the struggle each get two or three mu of land. You become the master, and the landlord becomes a pauper and flees. That's considered "the poor turning over." But the Communist Party has various forms of subtle levies on the one year's harvest of the land you've been allocated, so 80% is extorted by the party that "turned you over." Watching the "party officials" eat rice and white flour while you eat buckwheat and sorghum is "turning over"! What's most capable of fooling people is the "labor model" and "battle hero" that the Communist Party praises. If working like an ox or horse increases the capital for ambitious people to start more rebellions, then being called a "labor model" is something to cry about; if engaging in crazy actions to seize cities and land throws the entire country into greater unrest, then being called a "battle hero" is something to weep for!</p>
<p>The Communist Party attacks bureaucratic capital with all its might, but all the businesses in the "liberated areas" are completely party-run. The people have no freedom to do business. A rickshaw puller said humorously, "Only this bowl of rice of ours hasn't been snatched away by them." From grain to daily necessities, nothing is spared from the Communist Party's control. A legitimate merchant cannot even think about having a livelihood unless they join the Communist Party or collude with Communist Party members. As a result, the people's wealth is completely plundered. The people have no food for the next day, and they don't know what tomorrow will bring.</p>
<p>Occasionally, a family may have a chance to eat meat. They eat it in secret, and the neighbors don't even know about it; but the Communist Party's secret agents smell the "scent of meat" as if they appear out of nowhere, and they come to visit you "friendly"ly. They know that their extorting efforts are very thorough, and there is no way to eat meat without a special source, so they become suspicious of you and make you the target of struggle. This kind of "scent-smelling" organization is indeed one of the wonders of the 20th century. The Communist Party members themselves enjoy a very luxurious life. Although their slogans are always "the working masses" and "enduring hardship and hard work," who doesn't like to enjoy life? Having so much land at their disposal, why not enjoy it? Li Yimang, the chairman of the Suwan Border Region Government, had his mansion at No. 4 Anle Lane in Huaiyin, and I made a special trip to visit it. The houses in Huaiyin are all old-fashioned, but Li's mansion has a Western touch in its Eastern sentiment. According to the neighbors, the interior furnishings are very exquisite, with walls full of bookshelves, Russian carpets, Western-style furniture, many sofas, and countless decorations and collectibles. Someone saw him moving his belongings with dozens of large carts before and after the retreat. When I went, I could still see some of the paintings, calligraphy, and furniture that had not been moved away, including two rather valuable beds. One was made of ebony and fine rattan, with marble embedded in the bed frame, and the other was probably for summer use, with the entire bed made of glass except for the wooden frame. There was also a foreign porcelain bathtub, which was nothing special, but it was the only one in Huaiyin. It is conceivable that Li knew how to enjoy life.</p>
<p>In order to consolidate their rule, they had to further indoctrinate the people. They started to work on children, and all the teaching materials were a set of ideological training. For adults, in addition to using terrorist means and arbitrarily accusing anyone they didn't like of being a "national special agent" and killing them, they held meetings almost every day, regardless of whether you had something to do or not. In the meetings, they made grand pronouncements, and the purpose was to correct your "central brain."</p>
<p>This meeting style also had a purpose, which was the application of their so-called "democratic" method. If a plan was to be implemented, in order to respect "democracy" and pass "public opinion," they would gather everyone together and ask, "Do you agree or disagree?" The frightened masses would express their agreement under the leadership of certain people, and thus "democracy" would be realized.</p>
<p>In terms of women, they also had several organizations, such as the Women's Federation and the Sisters' Team. The Communist Party vigorously promoted "women's liberation" and "improving women's status," and they certainly did achieve that. However, it is inconceivable on what kind of position women were elevated. The common people definitely told me: when "battle heroes" return from the front, when "labor models" become famous overnight, and when they need to be comforted, the Women's Federation and Sisters' Team must send people to give the most "gentle" comfort, which is listed as one of the main tasks of these organizations and is considered a great honor. In short, the list is endless. The "liberated areas" have been turned upside down, and there is no peace.</p>
<p>Speculators who joined their organization through threats and inducements, once they entered, they made it impossible for you not to follow them wholeheartedly. They asked you to commit crimes, to kill people, so that it was impossible to gain a foothold in this place without relying on their power.</p>
<h3>The People Stretch Their Necks, Looking to the Central Government</h3>
<p>Good people cried secretly every night. A 59-year-old woman could not bear the oppression and bullying and said with a sigh, "Why hasn't the Central Army come yet?"</p>
<p>Ears were everywhere, and a Communist Party secret agent came over and said, "Do you want the Central Army to come?"</p>
<p>The woman couldn't bear it and retorted, "Let's see how long you can be tyrannical!"</p>
<p>As a result, the woman was hanged on a tree. The people below asked her, "Have you seen the Central Army?" She endured the pain and said, "No." So, she was hanged even higher. She couldn't bear it anymore and shouted, "I see it!" The rope was cut, and the woman fell and died.</p>
<p>Such tragic "looking to the Central Government" events have happened several times. Violence and terror policies cannot last long. The National Army came and truly liberated the "liberated areas." That woman was not disappointed, even though she could not see it; but isn't the new atmosphere in the recovered areas today exactly what she had hoped for?</p>
<h3>A Sudden Transformation, Vigorous Vitality</h3>
<p>After scrubbing the dark walls, new and stimulating slogans were posted; the most difficult people gradually entered the city with a smile; the shops slowly opened their doors, although there were not many goods on display, they still looked like shops; in the early morning, the clear bugle calls rang through the silent land, warhorses neighed loudly, and the sound of turning wheels mixed with the sound of slaughtering pigs... Huaiyin City had a vigorous vitality.</p>
<p>Recently, Huaiyin can be regarded as a representative of the recovered areas in northern Jiangsu, having undergone a sudden transformation, which should be said to have restored its free appearance. People no longer have to attend those damned "small group meetings." You can handle your life however you like, and no one will interfere with you. The new order that the Communist Party tried to establish for a year disappeared completely in an instant. The Political Department of the Garrison Command wrote in large letters on the walls: "Respect the customs and habits of the citizens of all cities!" People felt infinite comfort when they saw it.</p>
<p>The number of disputes is not as high as imagined. Those who received land they were not entitled to handed it over without saying any nonsense. The counterfeit currency was invalidated and discarded more readily than a piece of waste paper. The common people suffered losses, but they still endured it. When they started accepting the counterfeit currency, they thought that one day it would be abolished. The Communist Party's extorting techniques were certainly superb, but the common people still had a few silver dollars stored in their cellars, more or less. Before the Communist Army retreated, they also bought some cheap goods that the Communist Army could not take away in the chaos. When the National Army came, those with goods took them out to exchange for legal tender, and those without goods used their labor to earn a living. At first, they did not know the value of legal tender, and a catty of pork only sold for 80 yuan. It was too cheap, and most of the buyers were National Army soldiers—they felt bad and gave a little more. Later transactions were priced according to silver dollars. If a product was worth one silver dollar, it would be given 1,500 yuan in legal tender. In this way, chaos was temporarily avoided, but as the number of people increased day by day and the source of supplies was lacking, prices could not help but rise.</p>
<h3>Guanyin Temple, Under the Oil Lamp: The Magistrate of Huaiyin County Buries His Head in Official Business</h3>
<p>Since the recovery, the most burdensome work has been done by the county government, and the most pitiful situation has been the county government's. The old site of the Huaiyin County Government was destroyed and is now located in a Guanyin Temple. At night, under the oil lamp, the exhausted county magistrate buried his head in official business. Anyone with a little background wants the county government to find a way to do this and that. But the county government, from exile to entry, only brought a few people, without a single item of supplies.</p>
<p>It is true that political coordination does not match military coordination. But think about the local government, manpower, material resources, and financial resources, which one is not difficult?</p>
<p>Manpower: The county government does not have capable cadres; there are not so many porters for military service. In addition to those who had already fled, the young people in the recovered areas were temporarily pulled away by the Communist Party, leaving behind only the old and the young, the disabled and the sick. How can a few young people meet the required numbers?</p>
<p>Material resources: The Communist Party has already taken away the material resources that could be taken, and the whereabouts of those that have not been taken in various districts are unknown. The materials received by the reception committee jointly formed by the Party, Government, Military, and Corps Room (Central Investigation and Statistics Office) are only a small minority. How to deal with it? We still have to wait for instructions from above. And for military needs, building bridges and constructing fortifications requires materials, where can they be found? Difficulty upon difficulty?</p>
<p>Financial resources: The Jiangsu Provincial Government issued 15 million yuan of reconstruction funds to the exiled county government. All expenses related to reconstruction preparation and reconstruction facilities from exile to entry are all covered by this figure. The recovered areas are full of devastation and everything is waiting to be done. How many things can 15 million yuan do? After the recovery, local expenses must be raised by themselves. The provincial government issues a temporary subsidy of 1 million yuan per month, which must be returned in the future. The locality is dilapidated, and the people are survivors of a disaster. The source of revenue is clearly zero. I admire the work spirit of the administrative staff in the recovered areas: they only eat, they can't get paid, they are exhausted all day long, they are scolded, and they may even be beaten, but they are not discouraged at all.</p>
<p>Relief is being handled separately by the Northern Jiangsu Refugee Relief Conference, the Su-Ning Branch of the General Administration of Relief and Rehabilitation, and the Ministry of Social Affairs. Almost the entire recovered area is in urgent need of relief. What needs to be relieved is not only the problem of food, but also after the war, epidemics are prevalent, and there is no medicine; the cold winter is approaching, and the victims lack cotton clothes, and quite a few houses have been damaged, making the living situation a problem...</p>
<p>Saving the people from fire and water requires a process. The living problems of the people in the recovered areas have not yet been improved, but they say well: "We already have hope!" Not letting their hopes be dashed is something that the administrative authorities must be vigilant about again and again!</p>

<h3>Taiwan Provincial Highway and Water Conservancy Projects</h3>
<p>— Northern Airlines News from September 22nd, special correspondent Jiang Muyun</p>
<p>Taiwan, an island composed of two-thirds mountainous terrain, is clearly geographically different from mainland China. People often mistakenly overestimate Taiwan. In reality, the island's scenery is a mix of Southeast Asian and Japanese styles. However, its general infrastructure has a relatively good foundation.</p>
<p>Currently, Taiwan's public construction projects are primarily focused on the Housing and Construction Bureau under the Civil Affairs Department, which centers its work on building large-scale housing. The Public Works Bureau under the Industry and Mining Department is dedicated to highway construction and levee repairs. The Relief Administration has built hundreds of residences for ordinary people in Hengchun, the southernmost part of the island that was most severely bombed, but these are temporary relief housing to alleviate the housing shortage.</p>
<p>Island Highways: 17,000 Kilometers</p>
<p>During their initial 24 years of rule in Taiwan, the Japanese invested considerable capital, with transportation and water conservancy as key priorities. However, some projects were halted during the war, while others were damaged by it. The current task is to continue those that were suspended and to rebuild those that were destroyed. This is a difficult but necessary undertaking.</p>
<p>The total area of Taiwan is 35,973 square kilometers. It has over 900 kilometers of railway lines and more than 17,000 kilometers of highways, including 1,031 kilometers of provincial roads. Of these, 10 percent, or 99.30 kilometers, are paved with high-quality asphalt. County roads total 2,500 kilometers, with 15 percent, or 386 kilometers, paved with concrete or asphalt, and the remaining 85 percent with gravel. Township roads total 13,000 kilometers and are only lightly paved with gravel, with some sections passable only by pedestrians and oxcarts.</p>
<p>Provincial roads, also known as the round-the-island highway, are a true asset to the province, accounting for over 80-100 percent of its economic value. The entire line is not yet open to traffic. The Zhuoshui River Bridge, approximately two kilometers long with 32 piers, had its piers completed in 1940. The Public Works Bureau plans to change the original steel beam design to a reinforced concrete cantilever design in the near future, which, according to the bureau's estimates, will save 50-100 percent of the construction cost compared to the original design.</p>
<p>The only transportation line connecting east and west, the Pingtung-Taitung line, is 173 kilometers long, with 64 kilometers currently open to traffic. Construction on the Zhiben River Bridge, within the 109-kilometer section, began in February of this year at a cost of NT$22 million and is expected to be completed by mid-October, after which traffic can pass.</p>
<p>Japanese Engineering: Now Abandoned</p>
<p>The line across the Central Mountain Range from Taitung Hualien Port to Taichung is 173 kilometers long. The Japanese completed only ten kilometers in six years. The most difficult 60-kilometer section, which includes a 3,148-meter-long tunnel, would cost NT$90 million to complete. The bureau plans to abandon it, as the detour around the southern end of the line adds only 33 kilometers.</p>
<p>Director Fei, who previously served in the Southwest Highway Administration, said that in coordination with Taiwan's economic construction plan, they must complete the concrete paving of the western trunk line, a total of 350 kilometers, within one year, and build seventeen large bridges within three years. At the same time, they need to improve the most dangerous coastal highway, the roadbed from Suao to Hualien Port. He further explained that the highway projects built by the Japanese here were not durable in order to save money and could not withstand typhoon attacks. He gave a simple example, saying that on the side of the road built in the mountains, the Japanese only built a wall on the hillside, while we (Fei referring to himself) need to build retaining walls. A type of Japanese engineering method has been clearly abandoned.</p>
<p>Low Transportation Capacity: Highway Bureau Puzzled</p>
<p>In Taiwan, most of the highways built by the Japanese run parallel to the railways. They were primarily used for military purposes in the past, but now their value is apparent, as Taiwan's railway equipment is entirely dependent on Japan. Currently, there is no way to replenish it. After the reduction in transportation capacity, even transporting coal to the port requires trucks and highways. Highway Bureau Director Hua, who manages transportation agencies and improves transportation efficiency, frankly explained the current difficulties to reporters after inspecting the island for a week. There are twenty passenger transport companies and seven freight companies in the province, with private shares accounting for 58-100 percent of each. Of the 2,145 passenger and freight vehicles he inspected at twenty-three companies, only 542 were actually operational. With fewer vehicles and a vast area, transportation capacity is insufficient, and the operating route has been reduced from 4,358 kilometers to 42-100, 1,859 kilometers. The Highway Bureau recently purchased twenty-four new vehicles at a price of US$1,910 per vehicle, but the cost of manufacturing the bodies is NT$200,000 per vehicle, an unbearable burden. With no way to increase revenue, they can only consider collecting road maintenance fees. This is an innovation on the island, but it has been agreed to by all companies. Deputy Director Qian interestingly provided reporters with a cost breakdown calculated on the principle of one vehicle per kilometer. According to their estimates, the cost is: gasoline 6.20, oil 0.80, tires 7.50, depreciation 1.80, grease 0.29, driver and administrative expenses 2.00, management fee 3.00, other 0.86, totaling 27.5 yuan. Averaging twenty people per vehicle, each person should pay 1.05 yuan, totaling 21 yuan. According to current regulations, they are already losing 6.5 yuan. However, under the policy set by the government, it is not allowed to increase the burden on the people.</p>
<p>River Engineering: Special Consideration Needed</p>
<p>In addition to highways, the most important public works project is water conservancy. Repairing levees is the most important task facing the bureau. Although the rivers in the province do not have the danger of the "Taiwan Strait," they are extremely turbulent due to their unique terrain and geology, whether they are rapid or slow-flowing. Taiwan's average annual rainfall is 2,500 millimeters, making it the second rainiest region in the world, and the concentration of rainfall is even more astonishing. The destructive power during heavy rains is unimaginable. The general characteristics of the rivers are steep longitudinal slopes, extremely high flood flows, and extremely low dry season flows, with a large amount of sediment and gravel, resulting in unpredictable changes in the river course. These conditions require careful consideration of river construction methods.</p>
<p>In the forty-five years from 1900 to 1942, the Japanese completed a total of 470,000 meters of levees for Taiwan's river projects. The water management plans for the province's twenty-nine main rivers were completed in 1933. In the years before the retrocession, the war affected construction, leaving the province's rivers in a state of neglect, resulting in various disasters. At that time, the dikes, revetments, and drainage projects damaged by disasters in the major rivers were approximately 35,000 meters long. After the handover, the government spent NT$14 million on disaster repair projects last year, repairing 3,895 meters of dikes and revetments, but this project accounted for only one-tenth of the urgently needed repairs. Director Fei said that if they want to restore the original state before 1941, it will take at least six years!</p>
<p>Stone Embankment Project: Three Methods Adopted</p>
<p>The bureau has adopted these three methods for river construction in the province:</p>
<p>(1) For rapid rivers, use stone embankment projects with rubble masonry and wire mesh gabion revetments. Collect cobblestones from the riverbed and weave them into wire mesh gabions on site. Although this is relatively simple, it has flexibility and is very effective for revetments in rapid rivers. However, it is not suitable for the most rapid rivers and sometimes requires the use of iron bars. The Touqian River and Wu River both use this type of project.</p>
<p>(2) For slow-flowing rivers with some cobblestones and fine sand in the riverbed soil, use brick masonry slopes, connecting the bricks through two holes each to form a whole. The Zengwen River and the lower reaches of the Tamsui River both use this method.</p>
<p>(3) For secondary rapid rivers, use permeable dam projects with frames, using reinforced concrete columns or old railroad tracks. The Yilan Zhuoshui River and the central section of the Wu River both use this method.</p>
<p>Small TVA: Regaining Popular Support</p>
<p>Director Fei specifically mentioned the Agongdian Dam project in Tainan, which is under construction. He dissected eight photos and pieced together the current construction progress. This water management project employs over a thousand workers, machines, and electricity. Construction began in April of this year, with 40 percent completed each year and is scheduled for completion in 1948. The value of this dam is that it can prevent 80,000 mu of farmland from being impacted by floods and can irrigate 90,000 mu of farmland. He said this is Taiwan's small TVA.</p>
<p>The Public Works Bureau has eight engineering teams distributed throughout the province. These hard-working technical personnel are not afraid of the heat and humidity or the epidemic, working for the province's transportation and water conservancy. In the remote mountains and coasts, in the torrents and sandy streams, they are truly the vanguard and protectors of the people. When asked about the hardships and joys, Director Fei said that Taiwan is much better than the wind and dew conditions in the southwest. He can still take a truck along the highway for a second island-wide inspection. He can reach any town or city in a short journey! Moreover, because water conservancy is related to people's lives, he can more closely experience the warmth of the people's sentiments beside the constructed dikes. This has a decisive significance in regaining lost popular support.</p>

Paris is the center of the world of art, and our talented compatriots who reside there can blend Eastern and Western civilizations, creating a harmonious fusion.</p>
<p>The "Exhibition of Works by Members of the Chinese Fine Arts Society in France," which began on October 1st and will end on the 20th, is hosted by the Fine Arts Society at No. 7 Villa Brune, 14th District, South Paris, and is supported by Dr. Qian Jieping, the ambassador to France.</p>
<p>Among the paintings on display, the works of Ms. Pan Yuliang, who has been teaching at the Central University for nine years, are the most numerous and appropriate, with as many as thirty-five pieces. Hua Tianyou's realistic line drawings are the most innovative, Liao Xinxue's landscapes, flowers, and animals, and Dr. Zhou Lin, the secretary-general of the society's still life realism, best demonstrate the inherent spirit of Chinese painting. Ms. Jiang Luxi's works depicting the new green branches and soft branches of the city walls and houses best showcase the characteristics of Parisian city beauty. Li Fengbai's paintings of military officers, wounded soldiers, red powder, and white bones on a hill, as well as the Famine Relief Map, are shocking and thought-provoking, highlighting the harm caused by war. In addition, Jian Shenshan, who lives in Pigeon Forest outside Paris, and Zhang Ziyu, also known as Shengfu, are both masters of figure sketching, as is Fang Yong, the publisher of the Overseas Chinese Times, who excels in landscape painting. Among the sculptures on display, Hua Tianyou's seventeen works, which encompass a wide range of styles, are the most touching. Yan Dehui's woodcut sketches from Yongjia, Zhejiang, are also very outstanding. Other works by Liao Xinxue, Zeng Ke, Ju Qingding, and Hui Chaoming are all worth appreciating.</p>
<p>At this peaceful gathering, the new autumn is as warm as summer, and visitors flock here to feast their eyes. The reputation of the society's members will inevitably grow with time, and their beautiful future can be expected.</p>
<h3>Visiting Tanggu New Port</h3>
<p>— Shenyang Airlines News, September 24th, Zhao Zhan, our correspondent in Shenyang</p>
<p>Speaking of the Tanggu New Port project, the foundation was laid by the Japanese by plundering our people's wealth. It took five years, and the project is half completed. In 1937, the Japanese suggested jointly building the port with Song Zheyuan. With the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, the enemy urgently needed the large quantities of coal, iron, and salt produced in North China, so they actively worked to build the port in an attempt to increase shipping capacity. In June 1939, they formally established an organization to oversee the matter. Construction began in October 1940. The original plan was very large, and after completion, it would be able to handle 30 million tons of goods per year. Later, due to the difficulty of the work, it was changed to a plan to handle 1.5 million tons per year. By the time the enemy surrendered in September 1945, the first wharf and the second wharf had been completed. The New Port project is very grand. I have one thought about this: the enemy plundered our people's wealth and was still able to accomplish something (of course, it was to strengthen their plunder efficiency). We ourselves cannot achieve results with the money from the people. It is really embarrassing. Since the enemy has already laid the foundation, if we cannot complete it smoothly according to the plan, we will truly be unpromising wastrels.</p>
<p>When the enemy surrendered, they destroyed part of it, and all the electrical equipment was destroyed. It is said that the design drawings and important documents were burned for a whole day. We ourselves destroyed part of it, that is, there was no management at all for a period of time. However, the ignorant people, greedy for profit, stole the military lines and demolished the houses. It may have been done by the military. A naughty child would also smash the porcelain insulators on the utility poles to see what secrets were inside. When the Ministry of Communications officially took over, it was already in a state of disrepair. As the reporter saw, the original materials had turned into piles of scrap iron and piles of rotten wood. Just the reorganization work alone required considerable manpower and financial resources, which could have been saved, but were ultimately wasted.</p>
<p>Construction Starts in October</p>
<p>First Complete the Large Sluice Gate</p>
<p>Construction can officially start in early October. The first step is to complete a large sluice gate, of which the Japanese have already built eight-tenths. After the sluice gate is completed, it will be much easier for ships to navigate into the Hai River, without having to bypass the long breakwater that protects the port from silt. The lowest water level of the sluice gate channel is five meters, the highest is eight meters, and at high tide it is nine meters. Ships of 3,000 tons can pass without obstruction. It is expected to be completed soon, and ships can be sent to test navigation before the freezing season this year. The new port construction plan has only recently been finalized and has not yet been announced. It is somewhat different from the original Japanese plan. The tonnage capacity is in line with the original Japanese plan, at over 8 million tons per year. The budget for this year is 770,000 yuan, and for next year it is 4 million yuan.</p>
<p>Two Large Breakwaters to Deal with Silt and Waves</p>
<p>The general model of the New Port is to build two large breakwaters, one to prevent siltation from the Yongding River and one to prevent wind and waves from the sea, both over 1,000 meters long. Four berthing wharves are built in the middle. Next is the sluice gate connecting the port to the Hai River, with two gates, as well as warehouses and urban areas. The first and second wharves were originally built by the Japanese, but the current channel is silted up and needs to be re-dredged. The third and fourth wharves only have a portion of the land leveled. The Japanese originally had a large-scale, well-equipped substation, but unfortunately it was completely destroyed and cannot be used. There are two coal loading machines on the second wharf that have become useless. The reporter saw that the military occupied the first wharf, with small landing craft arranged like sardines. American soldiers were sitting in Jeeps reading interesting novels. Five dredgers can start working after a little repair. More than twenty Japanese technicians have been requisitioned to serve us. The former Japanese directors and deputy directors Yamada Saburo and Hinoki Chisato are retained as technical consultants. Recently, Yamada and port consultant Xu Yanmou went to Tokyo to negotiate with Japan to export the machines and equipment used to build the port that were manufactured in Tokyo before. This negotiation was originally settled by our delegation's military attache, General Zhu Shiming, with the MacArthur headquarters.</p>
<p>Built in Three Years, More Advantageous Than Shanghai</p>
<p>Mr. Tian Shuji, the deputy chief engineer of the port construction office, said: From a technical point of view, a northern seaport is easier to build than Tanggu New Port. From an economic value point of view, Tanggu New Port is far superior to a northern seaport, because the two major commercial ports of Tianjin and Beiping are behind it. In the future, when the railways are restored and new lines are built, transportation will be accessible in all directions. The situation is indeed like this. A northern seaport is a natural deep-water port, while Tanggu New Port is artificially excavated. It is the largest port in North China for the flow of goods. In another three years, when the New Port is completed, with a cargo capacity of 8 million tons per year, plus Tianjin's 6 million tons, it will be more advantageous than Shanghai. Tianjin's position in North China can compete with Shanghai in Central China.</p>
<p>Hang Currency Like Waste Paper (Special Correspondent Hangzhou Zhou Reporting)</p>
<h3>Fashionably Dressed Women: Actually Human Traffickers; Headquarters in Macau; Using Domestic Servants as Clues for Abduction; Hong Kong Airlines News, July 7th, Special Correspondent Ling Fang; A Child of Seven or Eight Years Old Worth One Million Dollars Each: Transformed into Adopted Children of Overseas Chinese in Taishan and Kaiping Counties</h3>
<p>From the perspective of human trafficking, Hong Kong is a famous "piglet port." Before the war, hundreds of thousands of laborers were sold as "piglets" every year and transported to British or Dutch-owned islands in Southeast Asia to work in land reclamation or mines. After the war, this overseas market was temporarily unable to recover, so the business eyes of human traffickers turned to another direction, and they actually discovered a "New World."</p>
<p>Recently, some families in Hong Kong have suddenly announced that their children are missing. The parents searched everywhere, but to no avail—it turned out that the children had been abducted. It is said that those who engage in human trafficking are very well-organized. They contact customers in the "market" for "goods" on the one hand, and send people to Hong Kong, Macau, and Guangzhou to try to lure away children who "meet the conditions" on the other. According to the reporter's investigation: a child of seven or eight years old, smart and with correct facial features, regardless of gender, initially costs 700,000 to 800,000 national currency each, and has recently increased to more than one million.</p>
<p>The human trafficking organizations are said to have their headquarters in Macau, and most of the workers are women. They are fashionably dressed, seemingly from wealthy families, in order to disguise themselves from others. They cunningly use ordinary domestic servants as clues for abducting children. Children abducted in Guangdong and Hong Kong must first be transported to Macau and then sent to the "market" nearby.</p>
<p>The formation of that "New World" in the human market is a sad story:</p>
<p>Most of the abducted children are sold to overseas Chinese families in Taishan and Kaiping Counties in Guangdong (commonly known as Siyi). According to guests who recently came to Hong Kong from Siyi, Siyi has suffered a sharp decline in population in recent years due to the Japanese invasion and two famines, reaching a terrifying level. Siyi is the hometown of overseas Chinese in the Americas. After the war, remittances from overseas Chinese flowed smoothly, and large numbers of overseas Chinese returned home. After leaving their hometowns for ten years, most of them found their homes destroyed and their families dead or scattered, as if they were living in another world. Even if their fields were fortunately preserved, they felt lonely and could not bear the desolation. In order to comfort their lonely feelings in old age, they had a tradition of buying adopted children in the past, and now it is even more urgent. Human traffickers have seen the needs of general overseas Chinese and the market is booming.</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese have a lot of money, and some are eager to revitalize their families by buying sons and marrying daughters-in-law. Therefore, sixteen or seventeen-year-old girls have also become targets of abductors. There are many who are ignorant and fall into their trap.</p>
<p>The threat faced by children in Hong Kong and Guangzhou from abductors is much greater than the "skinning chickens" of children in Shanghai! Should the families who have lost their children blame those inhumane abductors, or those elderly overseas Chinese who return home with grief?</p>

<h3>The U.S. and Soviet Union in Korea: The Competition Intensifies</h3>
<p>— Special Translation from Our Editorial Department — Translation by Zuoxi from the Saturday Evening Post</p>
<p>The most dangerous line for the United States is the 38th parallel, which bisects Korea. The Soviets attach great importance to this line, while we Americans seem to disregard it. Undoubtedly, this line is drawn between two mutually suspicious nations, where a small misunderstanding could ignite a war. Although this line is far from our Pacific coast, American military leaders consider it crucial to our security, but the general American public has yet to realize its significance.</p>
<p>Before the war, no single sufficiently powerful nation in the Far East could fully control the region. Although Japan was ambitious, it had to consider the Soviet Union, and China still possessed significant self-defense capabilities. After Japan's defeat, the balance of power in the Far East was entirely lost, and the United Nations showed no signs of developing any new force to replace it. This vacuum was filled by new forces from opposite directions: American power came from the sea, with the advantages and disadvantages of maritime transportation; Soviet power came from land, with the advantage of contiguity and the disadvantage of remoteness. These two powers converged in Korea. This 38th parallel is not merely a convenient demarcation line between two allied nations; it is a border between two countries with fundamentally opposing policies.</p>
<p>Inability to Compromise</p>
<p>Korea is the only country where the U.S. and the Soviet Union stand in direct opposition. Many believed that without the involvement of the British or French, our relations with the Soviet Union might be better, but this hope has been greatly disappointed. Korea has become a testing ground for post-war U.S.-Soviet relations, and the conclusion that can be drawn is exceedingly bleak. The U.S. has so far been unable to reach a compromise with the Soviet Union to protect our interests. Korea is also an excellent example of Soviet negotiating tactics and the activity of the fifth column.</p>
<p>To understand the positions of the U.S. and the Soviet Union in Korea, look at the map of Northeast Asia, and you will see that Korea juts out in front of Northeast and North China. Although the Soviet Union has withdrawn from the southern and central parts of Northeast China, allowing the Nationalists and Communists to engage in civil war there, it has not relaxed its grip on the Liaodong Peninsula in southern Northeast China, which is not far from Korea and is the location of Lushun (Port Arthur) and Dalian (Dairen). Northeast Korea borders Soviet Siberia, and if good roads were built there, it would take only two hours to drive by car from Vladivostok to this area. Assuming the Soviet Union occupies all of Korea's airfields, they could control Northeast China, North China, and the Chinese coastal areas north of Shanghai. They could exert pressure on Japan, regardless of the American occupation forces stationed there. On the other hand, the American influence in southern Korea can also put pressure on Dalian, Vladivostok, and even further places. This is the geographical shape of Korea in the minds of the Soviets, and it explains most of their activities in this region.</p>
<p>The Soviet doctrine is that revolution and civil war are inevitable in capitalist countries, and similarly, war between capitalist countries and the Soviet Union is also inevitable. Currently, the most powerful capitalist country is, of course, the United States, and the Soviet Union believes that war between the U.S. and the Soviet Union is bound to happen sooner or later. The Soviet Union's plan in Korea stems from both a geographical concept and this belief.</p>
<p>On our American side, the strategic need is just as clear as it is for the Soviet Union. In the past, we suffered enough from having a powerful, hostile naval power controlling the coast of East Asia. But it does the United States no good to eliminate Japanese control and threats only to replace them with Soviet control and threats. Once Korea falls into Soviet hands, and Soviet influence penetrates North and Central China, a powerful Russian empire will soon emerge, stretching from the far northern coast all the way to the Yangtze River, and it could develop into a military base for future operations against the United States. Therefore, we must maintain America's line in Korea. Although we are willing to make concessions or compromises, we are unwilling to accept the Soviet demand to rule Korea.</p>
<p>Soviet Garrison</p>
<p>The headquarters of the Soviet garrison is located in Pyongyang, the second largest city in Korea. It has good railway lines connecting to the ports on the east coast, from which there is direct sea access to Vladivostok. There is already direct land transportation.</p>
<p>The number of Soviet troops stationed in northern Korea ranges from 220,000 to 250,000, which is much larger than the total number of American occupation forces stationed in both Japan and Korea. Compared to the troops led by Lieutenant General Hodge, whose headquarters are in Seoul, it is like comparing a great wizard to a small one. The Soviet garrison is not only large in number but also consists of elite troops. On both sides of the line, the U.S. stations a squad, while the Soviet Union stations a company or a battalion. The U.S. squad is led by an inexperienced corporal, while the Soviet company is led by a well-trained captain. Everywhere, it shows that the Soviet Union intends to gain a military advantage. The Soviet troops stationed in Korea do not believe that their mission is to maintain order in Korea but to continue fighting against fascism and tyranny. They believe that the American garrison is the only obstacle preventing them from completing this mission.</p>
<p>The contrasting policies of the U.S. and Soviet garrisons are most evident near the line. This dead zone prevents the Korean economy and political life from returning to normal. This artificial obstacle was unexpected even by the Japanese. Previously, residents, vehicles, and goods could move freely, but now all legitimate activities are hindered. The U.S. side's patrols are more lenient, but the Soviet side's defenses are very strict. Probably the only Koreans who can freely pass through the line are those who have obtained permission from the Soviet side.</p>
<p>The Soviet garrison is stationed right on the line, while the U.S. side deliberately retreats in some places to avoid a direct confrontation. The Soviet troops are sometimes very friendly and amiable, but sometimes they become very serious and suspicious. The U.S. military can never grasp their true attitude.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union implements a police state system in northern Korea. Korean men between the ages of seventeen and sixty must carry a citizen's card. Korean people who wish to obtain this citizen's card must first swear allegiance to the Soviet military commander and the Moscow resolutions concerning Korea, otherwise they are treated as criminals. Korean people without a police pass cannot move freely even in northern Korea. Large portraits of Stalin, Lenin, Marx, etc., are displayed in every town, along with various propaganda materials, making people think of this place as a subdivision of the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Implementing Communism</p>
<p>In northern Korea, all political parties except the Communist Party are prohibited from operating, and Koreans there are not allowed to listen to radio broadcasts from the American occupation zone. All industry and commerce are monopolized by the Soviets. Land exceeding twelve and a half acres is confiscated and distributed to Koreans who do not have land. This land distribution method allows the Soviets to gain the support of the newly created class of small landowners.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union not only implements communism in northern Korea but also deliberately tries to extend communist influence into southern Korea. When the time is right, the Soviet Union will suggest that the U.S. and Soviet garrisons withdraw from Korea simultaneously. After the U.S. military withdraws from Korea, the Korean Communist Party can become very active, and the Korean troops who have received communist training can seize important institutions on the pretext of creating trouble. In a short period of time, the Communist Party can completely control the Korean government and the Korean peninsula, while the Soviet Union will be behind the scenes, promoting its political and military plans.</p>
<p>However, according to recent reports, infighting has broken out within the Communist Party in southern Korea, and disturbances have also occurred in northern Korea. Presumably, the resentment of the residents of northern Korea towards the Communist Party is an undeniable fact. Although the Soviet authorities have a large army stationed there, they cannot help but feel uneasy. On the other hand, the American troops stationed in southern Korea have not had any friction with the Korean people there so far.</p>
<p>But although the Soviet Union's relationship with the Korean people is not as good as ours, their position is still more advantageous than ours. As this situation evolves, it is difficult for us to imagine that the Soviet Union will not achieve final victory.</p>

<h3>"Alaska" and "Aleutian Islands"</h3>
<p>— Zuoqi</p>
<p>According to a United Press report from Pearl Harbor on October 3rd: Admiral Towers, Commander of the U.S. Pacific Fleet, told reporters that the U.S. Navy plans to build permanent naval bases in the Aleutian Islands and Alaska to prevent unexpected attacks from abroad due to the recent tense international situation.</p>
<p>Alaska is located in the northwest corner of North America, bordering Canada to the east, and separated from Soviet Siberia by the Bering Strait to the west. This land originally belonged to Russia, and in 1867, the United States purchased it from Russia for $7.2 million, thus becoming American territory. Alaska is bordered by the Pacific and Arctic Oceans to the north and south. The northern coast is straight, but the Pacific coast and the Bering coast have deep bays and numerous islands. The Alaska Peninsula extends southwest, and the Aleutian Islands form a long, continuous strip, which is the first line of Arctic defense for the United States today.</p>
<p>The total length of railways in Alaska is over 1,400 kilometers. Sled dogs can also be used to increase transportation convenience.</p>
<p>Dutch Harbor in the Aleutian Islands is an important U.S. naval base, known as the "Singapore of the North Pacific."</p>
<h3>The Gulf Between the U.S. and Soviet Union</h3>
<p>— Chu Yukun</p>
<p>The Two Countries Part Ways and Prepare Separately</p>
<p>The international situation this week still presents a picture of external relaxation and internal tension. Although politicians, diplomats, and even military leaders continue to say things like "war will not break out again," the level of preparedness in various countries is still increasing, especially between the U.S. and the Soviet Union. Since the new Secretary of Commerce, Harriman, was sworn into office, the U.S. policy towards the Soviet Union has clearly abandoned the path of the late President Roosevelt. He said: "Marshal Stalin and other Soviet leaders deeply believe that capitalism and communism cannot coexist in the same world, so they are doing everything in their power to obstruct the efforts of Britain and the United States to resolve world political problems. Although the late President Roosevelt also believed that the U.S. and Soviet systems were different, he believed that peaceful coexistence was possible. If Roosevelt were still alive today, he would be implementing the policies adopted by President Truman and Secretary of State Byrnes."</p>
<p>On the Soviet side, Victor Kravchenko, author of "I Chose Freedom," published an article in "World News" claiming that Stalin not only believes that the world is threatened by a "new war" but is also doing everything possible to prepare for this new war. At the same time, Reuters correspondent Tang Guo, who was stationed in Moscow, reported on the situation of Soviet military reforms after returning home: (1) Reorganizing the army, strengthening its mobility and independence, and studying the effectiveness of atomic energy. (2) Expanding the navy and air force. It is said that the Soviet Union has the latest bombers and fighters; naval bases are also being expanded; (3) The Soviet army is thoroughly politicized and discipline is improved, with absolute obedience as the slogan. The purpose of Soviet military reform is to adapt to modern warfare. Therefore, in the situation where the U.S. and Soviet Union are parting ways and preparing for war separately, all peace talks are nothing more than an irony to the current situation.</p>
<p>The Paris Peace Conference Concludes as Scheduled</p>
<p>Although the opinions of the representatives of various countries in the Paris Peace Conference are still very divided, with no hope of reaching a consensus, especially on some important issues, the Slavic bloc and the Anglo-American bloc are still diametrically opposed. However, the Paris Peace Conference is scheduled to end on the 15th of this month and cannot be delayed any longer. The conference has been going on for more than two months, and the representatives of various countries have become tired of playing in Paris. They have long been bored with holding meetings and discussions, and all hope that the conference will end soon so that they can go to New York to change the air. Therefore, the draft treaties with Italy, Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Finland did not encounter any major difficulties and were passed by the plenary session of the conference. The chairman of the last conference was originally scheduled to be Guo Taiqi, head of the Chinese delegation, but the French delegation requested that France preside over it in order to fulfill its obligations as the host country, and China happily accepted.</p>
<p>The Twenty-One Nation Peace Conference opened on July 28th and ended on October 15th. It lasted for a full two months and eighteen days, making it the longest peace conference in human history. Although it passed the draft treaties with the five nations, it did not reach any solutions to important world political problems. This makes us unable to help but acknowledge the difficulty of creating world peace.</p>
<p>The Straits Issue: U.S. and Britain Agree</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of the Turkish Straits, the Soviet Union has twice sent notes to the Turkish government, requesting that the Soviet Union and Turkey jointly defend the Dardanelles Strait. What is the attitude of Britain and the United States? It is often a matter of concern to the world. Although the United States opposes the Soviet-Turkish joint defense of the Straits, it is also willing to consider the Soviet Union's legitimate rights in the Straits area. U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Smith, notified the Soviet Union on the 9th, reiterating that the United States, as a country concerned with the Turkish Straits, should participate in any revision of the Montreux Convention. He also said that the U.S., Britain, and the Soviet Union had unanimously agreed at the Potsdam Conference that the status of the Straits needed to be revised, but the method of revision should be in accordance with the provisions of the Montreux Convention. The United States could not agree with the Soviet Union's claim that the status of the Straits was only related to Turkey and the Black Sea countries. Turkey still bears the heavy responsibility of defending the Straits alone. In the future, if the Straits are directly or indirectly threatened, Turkey can appeal to the United Nations Security Council.</p>
<p>Since the attitude of Britain and the United States is so clear, Turkey can have nothing to fear. As for the Soviet Union's reaction, it depends on what kind of diplomatic offensive it will launch against Turkey.</p>
<p>French Vote: Ballot on the Charter</p>
<p>Since its liberation, the French political system has still been in the nature of a provisional government. The French head of state, Bidault, is still called the provisional president and prime minister. Although the National Constituent Assembly drafted a draft constitution between April and May of this year, it was put to a referendum on May 5th of this year, but it was rejected. The National Constituent Assembly's previous efforts were in vain. Another general election was held to redraft the constitution. The leaders of France's three major parties (i.e., the Catholic Progressive Party, the Socialist Party, and the Communist Party) have done everything possible to compromise, in order to complete the most democratic constitution in the shortest possible time and end the provisional government as soon as possible.</p>
<p>This referendum on the draft constitution was originally not a problem at all, but General de Gaulle gave two speeches before the referendum, expressing his opposition to this draft constitution, inevitably causing some of the voters, especially the members of the Catholic Progressive Party, to be influenced by him and change their votes to against. Therefore, the majority obtained by the French draft constitution was really not much, which is enough to illustrate the complexity of French domestic affairs. The problems in the future are still just beginning. October 15th</p>
<h3>Communism Attacks the Japanese, Secretly Plotting to Overthrow the Conservative Cabinet</h3>
<p>The Japanese occupation apparatus is entirely controlled by the United States. Because the U.S. prevents the Soviet Union from using the occupation apparatus to promote its policies, the Soviet side has now begun to adopt roundabout methods to make the Japanese people lean towards communism. The propaganda news broadcast by many radio stations in Siberia aims to encourage the Japanese to oppose the government of the conservative parties and to make the Japanese public lose confidence in the occupation headquarters.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union's current goal is to overthrow the current conservative cabinet that governs Japan. Ultimately, it hopes that Japan will become a pro-communist and pro-Soviet country. The Soviet side believes that the United States is establishing an anti-communist and reactionary government in Japan and suspects that the United States intends to turn Japan into its forward base.</p>
<p>The United States is firmly opposed to communism in Japan and advocates cultivating a conservative regime that is friendly to Western countries. A democratic constitution is being implemented, and during the occupation period, the Japanese people will receive training in democratic politics.</p>
<p>The occupation authorities are governing the country with a conservative cabinet. The Allied Headquarters hopes that this cabinet will continue to perform its duties until the new constitution is passed in parliament.</p>
<p>For this reason, the Allied Headquarters' policy of opposing radical activities is becoming more and more stringent. MacArthur personally issued a warning prohibiting mass demonstrations against the cabinet. The Japanese government has been granted permission to restrict the activities of the Japanese labor unions, because most of these groups have socialist leanings.</p>
<p>The Soviet broadcasts, on the one hand, advocate overthrowing the current cabinet, and on the other hand, urge the opposition forces in Japan to unite. Soviet broadcasters who speak Japanese fluently refer to Prime Minister Yoshida and his cabinet as reactionaries. The voices from Siberia advise Japanese supporters of democracy to organize a democratic front and fight to expel "these war criminals."</p>
<p>Overthrowing the Japanese cabinet at this time could increase the strength of the opposition parties. Currently, Japan lacks food, has five million unemployed, rampant inflation, and a shortage of housing. No government can overcome these difficulties. But this economic situation will naturally arouse public dissatisfaction with the ruling government, so the forces that oppose the two conservative parties that support the Yoshida cabinet are growing.</p>
<h3>Unemployment Increases, Anti-Government Sentiment Grows</h3>
<p>A public opinion survey conducted by Japanese newspapers believes that if an election were held now, the strength of the opposition parties would increase greatly, especially the Social Democratic Party, because the party has the support of labor. Currently, the Social Democratic Party occupies one-fifth of the seats in parliament. If it gains more in the election, it can form a government with the Communist Party and independents who occupy a majority in parliament.</p>
<p>The purpose of Soviet propaganda is to overthrow the Yoshida cabinet and force Japan to hold elections in the hope that non-conservative parties can rise to prominence as a result.</p>
<p>Soviet broadcasters attack the basic policies of the Occupation Headquarters with harsh words. They say that the new Japanese constitution supported by MacArthur's headquarters is a deceptive document, the purpose of which is nothing more than to retain the emperor, in which it despises the rights of ordinary people, making the cabinet and parliament obey the emperor. In fact, it is not much different from the previous constitution.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union believes that the Japanese emperor is a war criminal and opposes Japan maintaining the imperial system, even making him a powerless symbol, because he is the center that led the Japanese people to carry out world hegemony.</p>
<h3>Japanese Express Confidence in MacArthur</h3>
<p>— Nan, translated from World Weekly</p>
<p>According to the Soviet side, Japan's land reform is being obstructed by the Occupation Headquarters. Officials of MacArthur's headquarters are protecting Japanese reactionaries and preventing the redistribution of land.</p>
<p>MacArthur himself is also the target of Soviet attacks, saying that he is infringing on the authority of the Far Eastern Commission and failing to cooperate with the Allied Council for Japan. The Far Eastern Commission, representing eleven countries, is responsible for determining basic policies towards Japan. And the mission of the Allied Council for Japan is to provide advice to the Supreme Commander of the Occupation Forces. Soviet broadcasters said that the American occupation authorities have failed to cooperate harmoniously with these two commissions and are therefore intentionally or unintentionally helping Japanese war leaders to escape the fulfillment of the surrender terms.</p>
<p>But Soviet propaganda is not necessarily going to achieve its goal, although it may have some impact on the future overthrow of the Japanese cabinet.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, the Japanese seem to be quite satisfied with MacArthur's occupation work, because everything has not been as severe as they had imagined at the time of surrender. For a year, MacArthur has enjoyed a good reputation among the Japanese public and his position is very stable. Most Japanese are still afraid of communism and especially oppose the Communist Party's advocacy of overthrowing the Japanese imperial system.</p>
<p>The U.S. State Department is determined to prevent the Japanese occupation work from being divided as in *country name removed due to policy violation* and *country name removed due to policy violation*. Therefore, the U.S. government will continue to give MacArthur full support.</p>
<p>The foundation of the Japanese occupation apparatus is very solid, and foreign propaganda cannot shake it.</p>

<h3>Ouyang Xiu and Zhu Shuzhen's "Sheng Zha Zi" Case</h3>
<p>— Sun Yuehan</p>
<p>Ouyang Xiu was a great writer of the Northern Song Dynasty, and Zhu Shuzhen was a female poet of the Southern Song Dynasty. Both of them left behind collections of poetry and lyrics after their deaths. Moreover, both of their collections contain a "Sheng Zha Zi" lyric. That "Sheng Zha Zi" lyric is: "Last year on the Lantern Festival, the flower market's lanterns were like paintings. The moon rose above the willow branches, after dusk fell. This year on the Lantern Festival, the moon and lanterns are as before; but I do not see the person from last year, and tears wet my spring sleeves"! Because both of their poetry collections coincidentally contain this lyric, readers have countless doubts when they read it. After much debate and evidence from many researchers and literary critics, it is still impossible to distinguish the true from the false, and no one can tell which is which; at most, it is a case of this being one right and that being another, without sufficient reason. Fortunately, Chinese literati have always liked to be sloppy and stick to tradition, thinking that it is better to leave things vague than to solve them. Thus, it seems that this case has not yet received a truly accurate review and judgment to this day. I do not have the vision of an appraiser, nor the resources of a researcher, but I usually like to explore and refer to obscure phrases and classics. When I encounter a doubt, I often search until I forget to eat and sleep, until the truth comes out. I don't know when I accidentally recalled this case, and after reading Zhu Shuzhen's "Heartbroken Poetry and Lyrics Collection" and Ouyang Xiu's "Poetry and Lyrics Collection," I immediately realized that this "Sheng Zha Zi" lyric was indeed written by Zhu Shuzhen. Readers who want to know more about Ouyang Xiu's life experience and anecdotes need not be elaborated upon. Now, I will briefly introduce Zhu Shuzhen, firstly to confirm my views, and secondly to allow this generation of female writers who are deeply hidden and depressed to show their faces again in modern times.</p>
<p>Zhu Shuzhen was from Haining, Zhejiang, around the same time as Zhu Xi, and it is also said that she was Zhu Xi's niece, but this is somewhat inaccurate because, in terms of birthplace, Zhu Xi was from Xin'an. The genealogy does not record any brothers who moved to Haining. From a young age, Zhu Shuzhen already possessed a natural talent, was beautiful and charming, and loved to read. When she was at the budding age, she loved poetry and lyrics and once wrote a poem: "I first comb my hair and learn to paint my eyebrows, not knowing to whom my heart belongs? I will wait to hold the full Mid-Autumn Moon and separate from Xiao Lang with ten thousand poems." From this poem, it can be seen that she already had a very romantic and unrestrained mind and ambition at that time. She hoped to marry a talented man who could write poetry and prose, gentle and refined, so that they could reciprocate in the boudoir and enjoy the pleasure of companionship. Who knew that her parents were careless in her early years and deeply poisoned by the old ethical marriage system? They arranged a marriage with an ordinary family in the marketplace, so that she married a mediocre husband who knew nothing about poetry and books. Writing poetry and composing lyrics was like playing the lute to a cow. Although they did not often quarrel, she was depressed and sad because of this, and eventually died with resentment. Her poems and lyrics are full of expressions of dissatisfaction, most notably in a poem called "Sorrow": "Gulls, herons, mandarin ducks make a pond, knowing that wings are not suitable for each other; the Lord of Spring does not let flowers be the master, how can they grow together as intertwined branches"! She herself resented marrying the wrong person, and in a poem to her parents, she also wrote: "Poetry and etiquette are said to be far away, who are my relatives with zithers and wine? Sadly, I look at the silk sleeves, and new tear stains are constantly wiped away." Reading these four lines of poetry, one can know that she had been accustomed to playing with poetry, lyrics, zithers, and wine at home with her parents since she was a child. However, once she arrived at her husband's house, she no longer had this kind of companion that she loved! Therefore, she felt the desolation of life and the mediocrity of her husband. In her sadness, she could only wash her face with tears, and her silk sleeves were covered with tear stains! She also expressed her feelings in a poem on an autumn day: "Although a woman's eyes are soft, tears do not flow casually; I have no good feelings, so I wave away the autumn of the five lakes." Those who have a heart will probably not be able to help but shed tears for her when they read it.</p>
<p>Therefore, whenever there was a flowery morning, a moonlit evening, or a lamp before the moon, she would write her own feelings and thoughts at will to relieve her depression. In the poems and lyrics she wrote, most of them were nothing more than sorrow, resentment, sighs, hatred, grief, sadness, injury, lament, sickness, and tears. In summary, these things were enough to break her heart, and the common thread was the word "alone." Almost every poem in the collection contained an element of loneliness, such as: "Sitting alone by the small window without a companion, ashamed to face the crabapple flowers"; "Particularly suitable for a small pavilion under a secluded window; burning incense alone, sleeping alone"; "Sitting alone by the small window without a companion, pitying the frosty moon that is round towards people"; "Who can understand my quiet feelings at this time? Sitting alone in the courtyard, the night is already deep"; "Leaning on the railing alone, doing nothing, reading books in the cool breeze"; "The lonely lamp under the window dims by itself, bored, I lazily close the door"; "Leaning on the empty building late at night"; "Heavy rain flies on all four eaves, sitting silently in the empty room"; "Wandering under the moon shadow, wanting to leave but still reluctant"; "How many old things, who will I share them with tonight"? "I will offer my good feelings to accompany my dreams, only fearing that the lamp flower cannot bear the cold"! And so on, countless to list. There are also many places in the poems and lyrics where she sheds tears, such as: "Who can I tell my melancholy feelings to? I can't bear to look at the tears dripping on my silk clothes"; "Tears are welling up on my peach blossom face, sorrow flowing deeply onto my pillow"; "The lamp flower occupies the matter of burning my heart, and my silk sleeves are always used to wipe away my tears"; "Leaning on my pillow in the cold, unable to sleep, even a heart of iron and stone will shed tears"; "Turning and tossing in the mandarin duck quilt, who can I splash my pearl-like tears on"? "Sitting on the tower in the setting sun, leaning alone and secretly shedding tears," and so on.</p>
<p>Her situation was so desolate, and her husband was not to her liking; whenever there was a beautiful scene or a good time, she could not help but feel that it was all in vain. For example: "Leaning on the window all day long, quietly, what can I do with this spring before my eyes"? "The pond water is warm, and mandarin ducks come in pairs; the wind in the alleys is light, and swallows fly around"; "There is no place without the colors of spring in the world, only the people who should be reunited have not returned"; "The orioles and flowers have hatred and only offer it to me, the peach and plum trees are silent and only annoy me"; "How many places are there to hurt my heart, and I cannot control my melancholy feelings"; "Good times and beautiful scenery all become hatred, do not ask about the new year and the old year." Her resentment can be imagined. The "Sheng Zha Zi" lyric was created under these circumstances. In the two lines, "The moon rises above the willow branches, after dusk fell," some people think that Zhu Shuzhen had illicit love affairs, and the word "约" (yue, meaning "appointment") refers to having private affairs with a boyfriend. Some people think that the word "约" refers to her female companions. If Zhu Shuzhen really had a boyfriend, her poetry collection would have been burned by her parents, and less than one percent of it would have been preserved; it would already be just fragments, making it difficult to see the whole picture. But in her existing poems and lyrics, she has already revealed her hidden thoughts. For example, in "Sending Feelings," she wrote: "I want to send my longing and fill the paper with sorrow, the fish sinks and the wild goose stops again, clearly this trip is not far, but it feels like an endless end of the world." In "Unable to Sleep," she wrote: "The slight clouds blow, Xiao Night is not yet distant, pear blossoms with the moon reflect on the window screen, do not think too much about the surname, causing new sorrow to be chaotic like hemp." The second one says, "Silently hurting my spirit by playing the zither backwards with tears, picking out the cold lamp until I cannot sleep, taking off the phoenix hairpin to find dreams, opening my eyes until dawn in bed." The lyric "Hong Chen Zi" says: "The slanting wind and drizzle make the spring cold. Facing the wine, I recall the past joy; I once held the pear blossoms and wept silently, the fragrant grass breaks the smoke on the southern path. With tears of farewell, I look at the green mountains, last night I only got a dream opportunity, the water and clouds are leisurely, silently, what can I do when I wake up and my sorrow and hatred are still there. Turning and tossing in the quilt, I regret it in vain, it is easy to see heaven, it is difficult to see him." In "Sending Farewell," there is a saying: "The writing paper is full of a thousand sorrows, but there is not a single point of communication in my heart." One of the three "Lantern Festival" poems says: "Candles and silver flowers are red to the eye, and the drums and trumpets that open the sky are noisy with the spring wind. New joy is in hand in the midst of sorrow, and old things startle my heart in my dreams. I only wish to temporarily become lingering, and it doesn't matter if the moon is often hazy; how can I have time to get drunk while enjoying the lanterns, it may not be the same meeting next year." There are also two lines: "Returning, the forbidden leak has passed three or four, and the thin shadow of plum blossoms lies across the window." It can be seen that Zhu Shuzhen watched the lanterns until late at night on the Lantern Festival, and returned only when the moon reached the middle of the sky. Then, what is said in the "Sheng Zha Zi" lyric is indeed true, and there is no way to avoid it. Perhaps that lyric was written on the Lantern Festival of the year after this joyful meeting. If the word "约" refers to a female companion, then there are two poems in the collection about not going on a spring outing: "The neighboring girl invited me to go on a spring outing, I forced myself to brush away my sad eyebrows and go down the small building, but I hesitated to go out and reflected on myself, knowing that I was haggard and ashamed to see people"; "I am too lazy to respond to the intentions of young people, and my love of mood has always stopped, if I go to the old amusement place, I should only see spring sorrow in my eyes." Since there are spring outings with female companions, then there is nothing wrong with enjoying the moon with female companions as well. Therefore, regardless of whether it is a boyfriend or a girlfriend, this appointment did indeed exist in Zhu Shuzhen's life.</p>
<p>Speaking of Ouyang Xiu, he was born as a Jinshi and served as a remonstrance official, a participant in political affairs, a Hanlin attendant reader, a deputy privy councilor, a Qingzhou civil servant, a Chuzhou judge, and a junior tutor to the crown prince. He was nicknamed Drunkard and later called himself Layman of Six Ones, and was posthumously honored as Duke Wenzhong. Usually, his interactions with poetry, wine, and friends must have made his courtyard as crowded as a market, extremely lively, not to mention the Lantern Festival. How could he wander alone under the moon, sighing sadly and even shedding tears when the Golden City did not prohibit the blossoming of fireworks? Therefore, putting this lyric into Ouyang's collection seems a bit inappropriate, because male longing and nostalgia will never lead to weeping.</p>
<p>Ouyang Xiu once wrote a lyric: "Willows of Jiangnan, the leaves are small and have not yet provided shade, how can people bear to break them because the silk is light? Orioles pity the tender branches and cannot bear to sing, leave them to wait for the depth of spring. At fourteen or fifteen, leisurely holding a pipa to find, on the hall, money and wealth go down, at that time, meeting again is already concerned, let alone now"? After this lyric was written, many scholars criticized and refuted it, thinking that it was an erotic song; with Ouyang Xiu's prominent status, he was not allowed to write love lyrics at all, and any element of stealing incense and jade would reduce his reputation. He himself considered this lyric to be a lifelong burden after writing it. But comparing the "Sheng Zha Zi" lyric with the "Jiangnan Willow" lyric, its eroticism seems to be even greater than that of the latter. "Preface to Elegant Lyrics of the Yuefu Association" says: "Lord Ou is a substitute for Confucianism, and he prides himself on being romantic, but small people may write erotic lyrics and falsely attribute them to Lord Ou." "Records of Famous Ministers" also says: "When Xiu knew the Gongju, he was resented by Liu Yun and other candidates who failed the examination, and he was falsely accused of writing lyrics such as 'Drunk in the Penglai' and 'Looking at Jiangnan'." It can be seen that when later generations compiled Ouyang Xiu's collection of poetry and lyrics, many works by others were included. This "Sheng Zha Zi" lyric may have been a mistake made during the compilation.</p>
<p>Ouyang Xiu wrote very few poems and lyrics alone at night, while Zhu Shuzhen mostly composed them when she was alone and bored on moonlit nights. Taking the words "黄昏" (huanghun, meaning "dusk") in the lyric, they are often seen in the Collection of Heartbroken Poems and Lyrics, such as: "Like pear blossoms and drizzle after dusk"; "Sorrow becomes even greater at dusk"; "Fearing dusk and then twilight"; "Heavy rain falls at dusk"; "A slender new moon hangs at dusk"; "Facing each other in the water pavilion, it is already dusk"; "The old scenery of willows at dusk"; "Floating clouds all chase after dusk"; "Under the steps after a light rain at dusk"; "Leaning on the railing alone after dusk," and so on.</p>
<p>In short, after comparing, speculating, and judging from all aspects, it is indeed proven that the "Sheng Zha Zi" lyric belongs to Zhu Shuzhen. Because the circumstances, situation, life experience, and tone of the lyric are all different from Ouyang Xiu but coincide with Zhu Shuzhen.</p>

<h3>Sparks</h3>
<p>— Tian Su</p>
<p>I love sparks, although sparks are so small.</p>
<p>But friends, we should not underestimate these tiny sparks. Tiny sparks are the genesis of the greatest force in the world!</p>
<p>With fire, there is light, there is heat, there is force. Tens of millions of small forces produced by sparks, gathered from tens of millions of corners, isn't that a huge torrent? It will destroy all strong and stubborn obstacles and flow all over every uneven surface of the earth.</p>
<p>Let me tell you a story from our childhood.</p>
<p>It was a winter dusk. We were playing too much on a wasteland far from the city, making us forget the way home. Yes, we lost our way, and the sky turned dark. The sky was covered with dark clouds. The moon and stars were swallowed in the darkness. The sharp night wind was blowing in our ears, carrying the miserable cries of seagulls. Withered trees, barren fields, tombs... the surroundings were so gloomy. In the heavy encirclement of darkness, we could not see our own shadows. We were all anxious and our hearts were shrouded in terror. We all wanted to cry. Suddenly:</p>
<p>"Look, isn't there a fire in front!"</p>
<p>One of our companions shouted with joy. We looked up and looked forward. Ah! A tiny spark was flashing in front. Although it was a tiny spark, what lay in front of us was no longer darkness! Our hearts were revived. We got new vitality. The light of hope was burning in our eyes. We rushed toward this spark.</p>
<p>Gradually, this tiny spark turned into a huge light. It shone in front of our eyes, like a mother's gentle palm, gently stroking our bodies. We gained the village, we gained sympathy, we gained warmth, we all smiled with relief, and we regained the light!</p>
<p>Korolenko said it well: "This kind of night fire has this characteristic: it overcomes darkness, it is close to us, it is shining." Yes, fire is the source of everything that comforts and amuses mankind!</p>
<p>In Greek mythology, Prometheus stole a spark of fire for the sake of the unimproved lives of humans on the ground. As a result, humans on the ground became more active. And Prometheus was therefore bound to the desolate rocks of Scythia and suffered for who knows how many years.</p>
<p>Although sparks are just a small bit of power.</p>
<p>But friends, have you ever heard, "A single spark can start a prairie fire"?</p>
<p>Let a tiny spark shine on the wasteland of the dark night!</p>

<h3>The Drama of the Novel</h3>
<p>— Wang Pingling</p>
<p>A fortunate playwright, when his plays are often staged in major cities, his royalties, performing rights fees, if the theater agents and bookstore owners don't skim off the top, are naturally substantial. Some authors who are used to writing novels are also envious and itchy, and they start to practice writing scripts using the techniques of novels; but very few succeed. The reason is the lack of "drama." The British novelist Conrad once spent a lot of effort to adapt his famous work "The Secret Agent" into a play, and asked the playwright Galsworthy for advice. Galsworthy was confident that he could say a few honest words with the assurance of friendship, so he pointed out many shortcomings from the content and form of the script, purely from an objective point of view, hoping that he would correct them. Conrad agreed in person, expressing full agreement; however, because he had suffered greatly when adapting the script, he always felt that the success of the performance was absolutely possible. He thought silently: "Don't criticize me in an old-fashioned way, as long as it is moved to the stage, it will definitely take your front seat." In the end, he refused his criticism and did not change a single word. Who knew that when it was staged, it was indeed dry and dull, and not welcomed by the audience. Even friends who came to support the show could not help but sigh slightly and whisper to each other: "This is simply not a script, but a novel divided into acts."</p>
<p>Conrad's utter failure lies in the mistaken belief that all literary forms can use similar techniques to achieve the effect of expression. Everyone knows that although novels and dramas have many similarities, there are still different distinctions. People who want to try unfamiliar literary forms, neither can investigate their unique techniques, nor are willing to humbly accept the well-intentioned advice of experts. Undoubtedly, the result of their attempts must be a complete failure!</p>
<p>Both novels and dramas narrate stories, introduce characters, and explain the environment and time; however, modern novels should try to use acting methods as much as possible, letting the characters explain themselves and portraying the characters' personalities through actions. Only when absolutely necessary should they not write meaningless dialogues, and they must understand the "montage" technique commonly used in movies, writing out the people, places, and times in the story in an economical and concise way, and absolutely avoid redundant narration. Especially when characters appear in novels, everyone feels that the past flat spread is not as lively and active as the three-dimensional appearance in dramas. Modern novelists must be able to write characters on paper as three-dimensional as if the characters appeared on the stage, which is a technique that novelists must be good at. Otherwise, the drama of the novel will inevitably be extremely poor. What is the difference between a novel that lacks drama and those bland news reports?</p>
<p>Some novelists, such as Conrad, Henry James, and George Moore, can write better novels, but their works lack drama; therefore, the scripts they try to write are read plays, and once they are staged, they invariably fail. However, Alexandre Dumas, fils, the author of "La Dame aux Camélias," and Nikolai Gogol, the author of "Dead Souls," can also write better scripts because they are able to use acting methods when writing novels, making their works full of drama. That is to say, authors who cannot make their novels full of drama can never write scripts, and they cannot write dramatic novels without using acting methods to write novels. Dramatic authors do not need to know how to write novels, but novelists should read more famous plays, often watch the performances of various plays, and carefully experience the techniques of acting.</p>
<h3>An Inch of Mountain and River, An Inch of Blood 64</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>Before the car had traveled ten miles, we had already encountered trouble twice. At this time, it was too late to regret, so we could only be extra careful. The car was moving very slowly, the tracks were uneven, and it was shaking badly. Brother Hu and I had not rested all night. At this time, we had more food in our stomachs, the car was stuffy with sweat, and the weather was dull. With the car shaking, we felt very sleepy. Seeing that Brother Hu had already fallen asleep with his head drooping, I had to lean against the car wall and try my best to prop up my eyelids, looking at the fields outside the window to relieve my fatigue.</p>
<p>I don't know how much time had passed like this. I think it was at most ten or eight minutes. Suddenly, I heard Brother Hu shout loudly, "Hey—what's going on?" In the shouting, there was also a "pa" sound. It was just a moment. By the time I turned my head in surprise, Brother Hu had already jumped up. There was another "splash" sound, and I saw a tea vendor on the car holding his face, blood dripping from the corner of his mouth. A pot of boiling water porcelain was broken on the ground, and the water splashed on many people nearby.</p>
<p>Brother Hu wanted to go forward, but I quickly shouted to stop him. I asked what had happened, and it turned out that the tea vendor deliberately spilled a pot of boiling water on Brother Hu's leg.</p>
<p>At this time, the car immediately became noisy, full of public opinion: "This kid has skills, he knocked out two front teeth with one slap... People didn't mean to pour water on him... Ah, beat him... This kid is a spy, dare to hit people... Hold him, don't let him slip away..." While it was noisy, the front and rear car doors surged in, and many people came, some were car attendants, tea vendors, and two or three escorting police officers, as if they had made an appointment.</p>
<p>I stood with my back against the car window, watching the changes with cold eyes. The beaten tea vendor, seeing that people had come, immediately made a gesture and rushed towards Brother Hu, raising his hand to punch. Brother Hu laughed and casually grabbed the guy's arm and twisted it. Such a big man immediately knelt down, only shouting in pain. At this moment, the merchant-dressed thing sitting opposite us stood up, left his seat, pointed at Brother Hu, and shouted to the people who came in, "Arrest him and take him down!"</p>
<p>With this, the situation became clear, knowing that this was an arranged situation. The merchant-dressed person, without a doubt, must be the special agent's henchman, who came on the car to deliberately sit opposite us, trying to investigate our origins and route. Seeing that soft deception did not work, Brother Hu did not fall for it, so there was this trick of spilling boiling water. Maybe the original plan was not like this, because they did not know that Brother Hu was so skilled, so the evolution changed. If they had known in advance that Brother Hu was so skilled, perhaps the means would have been even more vicious.</p>
<p>"Hitting people on the car for no reason? - On what basis?" The police officers were already pressing forward.</p>
<p>"Are you the road bureau's police officers?... I have to explain this matter." I was afraid that Brother Hu would make too much trouble, making it difficult to end the scene, so I pulled him behind me. The tea vendor who was twisted was hugging his arm, standing in front, tilting his neck.</p>
<p>"Are you together?" A scar-eyed, thick-lipped police officer asked me, pretending to speak Chinese like a Japanese.</p>
<p>"Yes, he is my nephew, I am his aunt; probably together." I replied to him lightly.</p>
<p>"Why hit people? If he is wrong, he should go to me to explain it. Do you know that there is 'law' here?" This scar-eyed guy glared his eyes.</p>
<p>Hearing his tone, probably anyone who is a citizen of the Republic of China should be angry. I was originally prepared to teach this guy a lesson, but when I thought of our important mission, I must not fall for their trick because of this matter, I could only find a way to jump out of this circle of demons, so I said coldly:</p>
<p>"Since you are reasonable, then it is easy to talk... Now I and my nephew are together, so it is inconvenient to speak publicly for myself. Please ask these fellow passengers what exactly happened." As I spoke, I pointed my finger at a circle of people near me.</p>
<p>I don't know if these citizens believed in the philosophy of "each sweeps the snow in front of his own door," or if they were afraid of these hooligan police officers, or if they knew that there was a trap lurking in it. Just after I pointed like this, as if I had magic in my hand, everyone turned away at the same time.</p>
<p>"What are you talking to them about, arrest them and talk later!" The merchant-dressed person was a little anxious. Believe it or not, just as this sentence was finished, the train slowly stopped. It turned out that it had arrived at Shuangqiao Station.</p>

<h3>Cautions</h3>
<p>— Shao Fu</p>
<p>At the anniversary reception of the China School of Journalism, Mr. Pan Gongzhan mentioned something: It seems that in recent times, various sectors have shown a tendency to be cautious toward journalists. This tendency can be said to be good for journalists, as it indicates prudence and responsibility. It can also be said to be bad, because it somewhat implies aversion. Regardless of which aspect it belongs to, we should all reflect and restrain ourselves; otherwise, we will inevitably be affected in news gathering.</p>
<p>Because of these words, I am reminded of Blair's article in The New York Times Magazine, which recently published a review of President Truman's press conferences, two paragraphs of which say:</p>
<p>"The American president's press conference can be said to be the main illustration of American democratic thought. Because the source of power of the American government, including the president, is the consent of the governed. Therefore, government officials are public servants, and their actions must be accountable to the people. News reporters at press conferences can unofficially represent the American people in questioning their administration."</p>
<p>"When the president is waiting for the reporters to come in, he often greets the people near his desk by calling them by their names, acting very affectionately. When the receptionist says, 'Everyone is here,' the whole place is silent. The giggling in the front row and the chatting in the back row stop immediately. The president stands up. He is no longer 'ordinary person' Truman; he is the President of the United States, and in front of him are representatives of the free press of the United States and reporters from other countries."</p>
<p>News reporters themselves certainly need to reflect and restrain themselves, and it is also most fundamental that everyone clearly divides responsibilities, abides by the law, and does not conflate public and private matters. If everyone can do this, then there is no need for caution, because caution, if allowed to fester, will evolve into a blockade.</p>
<p>Random Thoughts on Advertisements</p>
<h3>Strange and Bizarre, Then and Now</h3>
<p>If you casually open a newspaper and look at those boxed advertisements, it is not difficult to see many bizarre pictures and words. Mermaids with human heads and snake bodies, fat babies with swollen bellies and feet, fashionable nude women, patients with rotten heads and feet – at a glance, feelings of beauty and disgust arise simultaneously. If you examine the words in those boxes in detail, most of the "advertising literature" makes you want to vomit, laugh, or curse! The reason is that in those multicolored, seemingly coherent but ultimately nonsensical words, there is no lack of good words like "exquisite," "king," "sensational," "unprecedented," "sacrifice," "delicious," etc., all of which are uniform and unchanging for thousands of years!</p>
<p>Of course, there are also some good advertisements that can be innovative and eye-catching. For example, the advertisements of several shoe and hat stores not long ago were indeed creatively produced. There are even more advertisements that are bizarre and intriguing. Recently, in a certain Chinese newspaper in Hong Kong, I saw an advertisement with the title "Introducing Mr. ×××, a Strange Doctor from Our Country, Using Medicine to Improve Social Morality," which said: "Doctor × has invented the latest and most wonderful medicines: Anti-Suicide Pills, Anti-Harm-to-the-People Pills, Anti-Adultery Pills, Anti-Divorce Pills, Anti-Free-Love Pills, Filial Piety to Parents Pills, Harmony Brings Prosperity Pills, Charity and Compassion Pills, Anti-Viewing-Bad-Movies Powder, Anti-Viewing-Lewd-Dramas Pills...etc. All of the above medicines, when taken according to symptoms, are invariably miraculous." What exactly are the pills mentioned in this advertisement? Or is there something else they are referring to? It truly leaves one feeling baffled and amused.</p>
<h3>Special Announcement</h3>
<p>I remember seeing a newspaper advertisement before, which was a notice from a certain consolidated tax bureau at the time. The content was: "Regarding the matter of announcement; This bureau has now hired Dr. Zou ×× as a medical consultant. In addition to sending a letter of appointment, this announcement is made specifically. Dr. Zou's clinic...telephone...outpatient service...××× Consolidated Tax Bureau." To advertise for a doctor like this is truly unprecedented.</p>
<p>Here, I will write about some strange and bizarre advertisements from various countries around the world. These advertisements are not limited to those seen in newspapers.</p>
<p>The Indian Observer once carried an advertisement: "Mesu Soap, with the function of cleaning the skin, making it beautiful and fragrant, exciting your body and soul." It also said that the quality of the goods exceeded all European soaps because "if you are a man and use this soap, your career will definitely flourish; if you are a woman, you will immediately find a good husband."</p>
<p>A large gold and silver jewelry store in Spain made a skeleton out of real gold. The head, hands, feet, and body were all sculpted from gold, and electrical moving parts were installed to make the skeleton reach out, wave its hands and feet, and make all kinds of surprising movements to attract the attention of passersby. This novel advertisement even won the top prize at the country's advertising exhibition.</p>
<h3>The Ingenious Use of Tombstones</h3>
<p>— Zheng</p>
<p>In a cemetery in Paris, there is a tombstone that reads: "Tomb of Fournier, inventor of the Eternal Flame Lamp. The lamp he invented consumes only one centime of oil per hour. He was also a good father, a good son, and a good husband. His widow is still continuing to run the Eternal Flame Lamp business, and goods can be delivered throughout the city. Those who see this tomb, please do not forget the lamp store across the street." Such advertising is simply inconceivable. Even more wonderful, there are even matchmaking advertisements on tombstones. This was in a cemetery in Massachusetts, USA, where there was such a wonderful passage on a tombstone:</p>
<p>"In memory of John H. Leighton, who died on August 6, 1800. His widow is extremely sad and hopes that compassionate people will go to comfort her. She is very young, only twenty-four years old, and possesses all the virtues of a good wife. She lives at number four Church Street in this village."</p>
<p>The world is so big, there is truly nothing that is not strange!</p>
<h3>Going Abroad</h3>
<p>— Ge Zhen</p>
<p>After reading the article "Direct Flight to San Francisco" published in the Shen Bao, I realized the trouble of studying abroad is like "passing five barriers" and "beheading six generals." One must pass the barriers before being able to ride the long wind and break through the waves, finally breaking free from the encirclement and obtaining the opportunity to study abroad.</p>
<p>Of course, this does not mean that every student studying abroad has to go through such troublesome procedures. Being close to the water tower makes it easier to get the first glimpse of the moon: Some follow important national figures as nominal staff members, some request a special permit, some impersonate the wife of a diplomat, and some act as attendants to important medical figures going abroad, and they can cross the ocean. After a year and a half, they return to their home country and call themselves "students who studied abroad."</p>
<p>Genuine, qualified students studying abroad should not be so "careless." They should first cultivate considerable abilities in their home country, and not be like the situations described above: going abroad without a purpose and returning home without any gains. If one is a political science student, it would be fine to enter Yale, Oxford, Cambridge, or other universities. After graduating and working in the country, familiarizing themselves with the political situation, they might as well go abroad again and work in overseas agencies, gaining some experience. Such internal and external transfers will surely yield practical results. Otherwise, if it is just a name without substance, why bother?</p>

<h3>Shooting Stars Fly</h3>
<p>— Yi He</p>
<p>The newspaper reported that on the night of October 8, thousands of meteors flew across the sky, resembling fireworks in the sky, and would continue for three days, until the 10th. Meteors were called Ben Xing (running stars) in ancient times. On a clear night, when we look up at the sky, we often see a star moving from one place to another, with a streak of light behind it, which is a meteor. So-called meteors are actually not like stars in the sky, and are not stars. It should be known that all things in the universe have the property of mutual absorption, that is, gravity. Therefore, various celestial bodies are scattered throughout the universe, and occasionally they are close to other celestial bodies, so a part of them is attracted. If another star is attracted by the Earth, and a part of it comes to Earth, that is a meteor.</p>
<p>Because meteors descend rapidly to the Earth and encounter the Earth's atmosphere, they become incandescent due to friction, so they can be seen shining. Their speed of travel is 20 to 40 miles per second, averaging 35 miles. The heating is greatest at a distance of more than 200 miles from the ground, and they are destroyed by their own combustion at a distance of 50 miles from the ground. Therefore, meteors are only swift sky travelers. However, some meteors are too large and have not burned up completely when they reach the vicinity of the ground and fall to the ground, and are called meteorites (Meteorte). According to chemical analysis, it is known that meteorites are mostly oxygen, iron, and sulfur.</p>
<p>Why are there so many dusts in the so-called city of dust? Apart from general coal smoke, it can be said that most of it is produced by meteors, because the ashes left over from the burning of meteors are scattered on the ground.</p>
<p>Meteors also exist during the day, but we cannot see them with the naked eye! If meteors fly to the Earth in groups, they are called meteor showers or meteor storms. There are meteor showers in certain seasons of the year, such as the Lyrid meteor shower at the end of June, the Orionid meteor shower in mid-October, and the Andromedid meteor shower at the end of November. The light colors emitted by various meteor showers are also different. For example, the light emitted by the Leonid meteor shower is blue-green, while the Andromedid meteor shower is red.</p>
<p>Pure meteorites or ashes can be found on Arctic islands such as Greenland, because there are no people there, and no other ash, only meteorite ash. Therefore, the precipitate obtained by dissolving snow is pure meteorite ash, which can be used for research.</p>
<h3>Three Children Born in a Single Birth Celebrate Their Fourth Birthday.</h3>
<h3>How Roosevelt and France Dealt with Stalin (3)</h3>
<p>— Translated by Pan Jin and Ge Chunliang</p>
<p>"When Stalin stood up to receive the sword, his emotional impulse was, I knew, very real. He stretched out his hands, took the sword from the red cushion, with tears in his eyes, which I saw with my own eyes. He quickly bowed and then kissed the sword. That great courteous expression, I knew, was definitely not deliberate. It was indeed very precious, touching, and sincere.</p>
<p>"He is a very interesting character. They say he is a countryman from the most backward part of Russia, but let me tell you, he has manners that the rest of us don't have.</p>
<p>"Churchill brought his daughter, Sarah, as his secretary and assistant. Of course, she did not attend the meetings, but one day, when we were waiting for the newspapers to announce, Sarah came out into the corridor where we were sitting to give her father something. Marshal Stalin immediately stood up courteously when he saw a woman, looking very puzzled because he didn't know who she was.</p>
<p>"Churchill took her arm and said, 'Marshal Stalin, may I have the honor of introducing my daughter, Sarah, to you?'</p>
<p>"Stalin bowed very low, took her hand, and kissed it in that old-fashioned, excellent European manner. The rest of us just said 'Hello, Sarah' or 'How are you?' So, by comparison, at this time, the best manners belonged to the Marshal."</p>
<p>There was an inseparable friendship between Franklin, Roosevelt, and the common men and women of America—to say the least, there was an inseparable friendship between him and the common men and women of the world. He wholeheartedly served them loyally. Even sometimes, when a certain plan that was beneficial to them could not be implemented for some good reason, he would investigate, estimate, and try to understand the arguments for why it could not be implemented: whether there was too much funding; whether there was too much government interference; whether the people's affairs were being controlled too much. Even if he saw a reasonable theory, he would still say, "True, but the people need it! They are expecting it!" He was still able to persevere to the end to get the matter passed.</p>
<p>His ability to get along with himself and others was gradually developed, which he did not have before. For example, when he first got his political job—Senator of New York State—he didn't have it yet.</p>
<p>I have a photograph of him standing on the floor of the legislature at that time: tall and thin, very active and agile, moving around on the floor. At that time, he rarely talked to anyone, and the senators also avoided him somewhat. He was not particularly likeable (that came later), with a hypocritically sincere expression and very little smile. He had a very unfortunate habit of raising his head, because he wore aristocratic glasses and because he was very tall and long, so the posture made it seem like his eyes were growing on his forehead, and made most people feel like they were looking up his nostrils.

<p>Common Sense Quiz</p>
<h3>Are "Glass Stockings" Woven from Glass? What Happens If a Kitten Eats DDT?</h3>
<p>— Ding Yichang</p>
<p>Below are ten questions. Please, every reader of "Free Talk," use your brains and choose the item that you "think is correct." Compare your answers with the answers tomorrow to see how many questions you guessed correctly.</p>
<p>Those who can guess more than six questions correctly must be someone who pays attention to scientific records in newspapers on a daily basis. A person with abundant scientific common sense. Even if it is a high school natural science teacher, if they do not approach new publications and accept new knowledge, they may not be able to answer them all correctly. However, the questions are not "difficult," but rather "new."</p>
<p>(1) "Radar" was one of the new weapons in World War II. It is:</p>
<p>(A) A type of the latest fighter jet;</p>
<p>(B) Equipment that uses the reflection of radio waves to detect direction;</p>
<p>(C) A type of germ bomb that was not practical before the war ended.</p>
<p>(2) Nazi Germany once used "flying bombs" to threaten the Allied forces. The other names for "flying bombs" are also called:</p>
<p>(A) V-1 and V-2;</p>
<p>(B) "Unmanned aircraft" and "flying arrows";</p>
<p>(C) Nazi revenge weapons number one and number two.</p>
<p>(3) "Penicillin," this new medicine, is:</p>
<p>(A) An inorganic compound;</p>
<p>(B) An organic, artificially synthesized compound;</p>
<p>(C) A type of mold.</p>
<p>(4) "Streptomycin," hailed as one of the greatest inventions in the medical field in 1945, caused a global sensation. In test tubes, it has been proven to be able to:</p>
<p>(A) Treat leprosy;</p>
<p>(B) Treat all venereal diseases;</p>
<p>(C) Treat certain types of tuberculosis.</p>
<p>(5) According to Einstein's theory:</p>
<p>(A) Light has weight;</p>
<p>(B) Light has no weight;</p>
<p>(C) Light can have weight or not.</p>
<p>(6) DDT, which was popular throughout Shanghai this summer (assuming it is not a slippery fake):</p>
<p>(A) Even if swallowed in large quantities, it will not cause death;</p>
<p>(B) DDT can poison and kill domestic animals such as kittens and puppies, and even elephants in zoos, just like small insects. The question is only how much of a "quantity";</p>
<p>(C) People suffering from tracheitis or whooping cough are in great danger if they smell DDT.</p>
<p>(7) The dye "Indanthrene," which is known as "unchanging in sunny or rainy weather" and "never fading," is made from:</p>
<p>(A) Coal;</p>
<p>(B) Indigo;</p>
<p>(C) Blue glass.</p>
<p>(8) The so-called "glass stockings" that are popular in Shanghai are:</p>
<p>(A) Woven from special soft glass silk;</p>
<p>(B) Pressed from special, non-breakable glass sheets;</p>
<p>(C) Woven from a new type of artificial fiber called "Nylon."</p>
<p>(9) The so-called "fluorescent lamps" or "fluorescent tubes" that many stores in Shanghai have begun to use in recent years, this new type of tubular lighting equipment has the advantage of:</p>
<p>(A) Saving electricity, not generating heat, and the color is closer to sunlight;</p>
<p>(B) The light emitted contains a large amount of "ultraviolet light" and "infrared light," which is beneficial to human health, and the lifespan is ten times longer than ordinary light bulbs.</p>
<p>(10) "Antu," also hailed as one of the inventions in the scientific community last year, is a:</p>
<p>(A) Special medicine that can cause rats to swallow and die from pulmonary edema;</p>
<p>(B) 100% the safest, most reliable, and side-effect-free contraceptive;</p>
<p>(C) Insecticide that is one hundred times more harmful than DDT, but is toxic, so it is not allowed to be sold on the market.</p>
<p>Answers will be revealed tomorrow.</p>
