<h3>參政會第二次會　經濟部長出席報告書面口頭遭紛紛質詢</h3>

<p>〔聯合社重慶廿一日電〕經濟部長翁文灝今日在國民參政會報吿，表示欲辭本職。翁氏報吿完畢，備遭非難，尤以接收官員，侵佔巨量敵方物資，以飽私囊等貪汚行動，參政員　責更烈，要求翁氏詳細報吿所接收敵物資，究有若干，並質問已取何種辦法，避免失業，對於經濟部官員大肆　指油』，是否知情。</p>

<p>〔本報重慶廿一日專電〕國民參政會花絮：（一）連日氣候轉凉，一部份參加大會者，俱御大衣，將所佩符號掩後，使警衛人員，大傷腦筋。（二）翁部長於報告後，獨占院部會長官歷，狀頗孤單。（三）明日上午政治報吿，今日下午三時，行政院茶會招待一部份人說。這是行政的設計。（四）兩日來的開會時間，不甚正確。開幕式是九時二十七分，第一次大會是三時一刻，第三次大會是八時三十分，有人希望參政員要打氣。（五）經濟報吿及交通之質詢，都是書面多於口頭，人謂這是戰術進步的無聲砲。</p>
<h3>一軍機離青來滬　在南京失事焚燬乘客中有戴局長衛士兩名</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕航空委員會軍用幾一架十七日飛離靑島，全機共截二十餘人，不意途中氣候惡劣，竟吿失事。據調查結果：機現已前在南京明孝陵附近歸陸，機身全部焚毁，祗剩殘骸。駡駛員及乘客，均遭焚斃，血肉模糊，辨識至難，惟已於尸體中袋現有軍委會調查統計局局長戴笠將軍之二衛士，及該局人事科科長　軒芳之亂章一枚。該機自失踪後，航委會及我空軍當局即派專機二架，在青島南京上海一帶，尋覓該機下落，其後復派專機八架參加偵查。此間調查統計局幹部人員，自接獲南京來電後，即於昨日下午赴京調查。聞十七日該機起飛後曾發出電訊二則謂中途天氣異常惡劣，此後即消息　然。據悉：該機本擬在京稍事停留，即行飛滬。</p>
<h3>中航失踪機乘客　全部名單已探明　貝淞蓀行前改乘他機免難</h3>
<p>〔木報訊〕中國航空公司十九日飛京滬機共七架，其中第一三九號一架，於加足汽油四百五十加侖後，當日上午七時正，自渝東飛。當時循例以無綫電與公司聯絡，初無異狀。迨八時正，無綫電聯給，突行中斷，此後消息，即吿不明。昨據該公司某職員吿記者稱：該公司自該機消息不明後，即命滬京漢各分公司派機分頭巡覓；一方面並請軍事委員會航空委員會及美空軍等協助搜　，惟迄今仍未明下落。據該職員私人臆測，以無綫電聯絡中止之時間計，該機失踪地點，可能在川鄂或川湘邊境，惟該公司之飛機，以前從未失事，故預料此次失事之原因，大致不出：（一）機件發生障礙，此點據稱可能性較少，因該公司飛機起飛前，均經嚴密檢查，駕駛員亦均屬中美有經騐之飛行員。（二）氣候惡劣，此點頗有可能，蓋川鄂邊境多山，故飛度須高，或因高空氣候劇變，機翼結冰折損。（三）無綫電天綫吹折，亦可使通訊中斷，故即使該機被逼降陸何處，暫時亦無法獲悉。（四）强烈風勢，亦足以使飛機迷失方向。惟據稱失踪未必即爲失事，可能爲被逼降陸云，該機全部乘客計三十人，其中有中國銀行滬行副經理陶器良，儲蓄部副經理董孝逸，行政院善救總署振卹廳長潘小蔓夫歸，小孩，一家六口，及該署職員二人。全部名單如下。來滬乘客計張公亮。張公信·董孝逸·梁瑟娜·陶器良·胡志剛。王蔣靜婉。及小孩一人，王在平·王次申·王次平·姚明初·張冠英·陳錫年等十四人；赴京乘客計　宗氏·謝　華·章雯·章倫·屈弟弟·屈鏡琴·饒亞筠·潘小蔓·周銘·及小孩二人，潘程氏，潘毓莊。陳秀蟾·胡樊侯·及小孩一人等十六人。其中小孩共計八人。中央銀行總裁貝淞蓀氏亦於是日乘機來滬，本已跨上該機，因嫌坐位不甚舒適，故下機改乘他機，得免於難，可謂天佑。</p>
<h3>廣州女間諜　一義大利小姐能操中英日語</h3>
<p>〔本報廣州廿一日電〕此間同時發生一與西門（見本報昨電）有關之女間諜案，該女間諜係一極美麗之義籍女郞，名貝安卡（Banca），年僅廿五歲，能操中英日說·一九四三年在滬與日要人齋藤及日海軍特務部長小谷中校等同居，並與華南特務機關主腦矢崎少將過從甚密，又曾與日人高橋大口等同居。行營已搜集相當證據，渠被扣留已四日，最近因病請准在博濟醫院留醫，記者晤之於該院二〇八號病房，雖面帶病容，仍不掩其美。據稱：渠係中國人，實非問諜。渠於一九三五年在義與一中國八譚展超結婚，曾生子女五人，後隨夫居上海，不久即離婚。一九四二年居於香港，生活甚苦，後又到廣州，與西門結識，由此生活，全由西門口供給。行營戰犯調查組主任湯炎光曾於昨十九日作非正式審訊，當詢其旣非間諜，何以能在淪陷期間，常乘日軍用機艦船，往來上海廣州廣州灣之間，至是渠即無言祗哭泣不絕。最後並曾簽字於供詞上，承認戰時一家數口，純由西門供給。後記者復查彼所謂彼之中國丈夫譚氏係某軍搜索營上校營長，現亦留滇。惟據譚上校稱：據渠所知貝恐非一間諜，因貝在滬時，被日人認伊係重慶方面間諜，曾被拘四次，且日本特務機關黑名單上，亦有貝安卡之名，此次被逮或因其受西門案所牽連云。現行營正多方搜集有關資料硏究中，聞不日即交法院正式審訊。</p>
<h3>越北未安定我暫留四師</h3>
<p>〔本報昆明廿一日電〕越北局勢，迄今仍未安定，我國在越北各機關，均已集中，俾使我軍保護。現駐越北之六十軍及九十三軍，將調至上海靑島兩地，刻正候船運輸。該兩軍離越後，我軍仍有四師暫留越北，須俟該地秩序安定，始撤離。</p>
<h3>梅思平等即解蘇　平巨奸七十名解冀高院</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿一日急電〕去年九月二十六日在京就逮之巨奸梅思平·李聖五·周學昌·岑德廣·胡毓坤·李謳一·鄭大章·凌霄·溥侗·郭秀峯等諸逆，及去年十月三日由日木解京之巨奸林柏生·陳君慧·何炳賢·周隆庠·莫國康諸逆，聞即將分批解往蘇州高等法院審訊。有關方面對押解手續，業已準備就緒，蘇州監獄內之若干特號，且已洒掃布置，虛位以待，惟何日啓解，尙無從探悉。消息靈通者均謂，爲期應不出數十小時因微聞林逆柏生，李逆聖五，梅逆思平等護知陳逆公博等解蘇後，早已作消夏姑蘇之凖備，近日諸逆之被褥襯衣已洗滌如新，似已預備將赴「天堂」矣。</p>
<p>〔本報北平廿一日電〕負責捕奸當局，最近即將大漢奸七十名，移送冀高等法院審理，冀高院已準備房屋，並發出旁聽證。</p>
<p>〔本報北平廿一日電〕此間某方消息曾任偽山西省長及僞華北政務委會總務聽長官之蘇　體仁，已自山西當局之管押下，畏罪潛逃，確吾待證。按日本投降後蘇連即由平返幷，去年年底中央負責捕奸當局，派員至幷，晋當局遵令將蘇管押，但不久即有晋各縣及各團體代表，上書中央，請求釋放蘇逆，並請求晋當局勿移去海子邊公園中之蘇體仁去思碑，惟是否出於眞正民意，尙不可知。</p>
<h3>訪華團團長談中暹</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿一日電〕暹羅訪華團團長　實，今接見本報記者，據談中暹友好條一約，最快可於二月後批准，關於暹羅排華事件，暹政府已採取嚴厲辦法，取締各種排華之秘密組織，暹政府極願以巨量暹米售與中國，但因限於英暹食糧協定，暹米必須全部售給英國。現中英已簽訂條約，由央國就所購暹米之餘額，轉售中國。目前暹羅不僅在通商方面熱望中暹邦交永固，獲得經濟上之合作，並望溝通中暹文化，加深兩國人民之友誼。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿一日電〕陪同暹羅訪華團來京之我國駐伊朗大使李鐵錚，因伊朗局勢極堪注意，即擬返渝，以便早日首途赴任。</p>
<h3>三個執行小組派赴烟台等處</h3>
<p>〔本報北平廿一日電〕調處執行部頃已決定派遣三個執行小組，分赴古北口，喜峯口，烟台，監督執行和字第一號命令，官方消息月來中共軍隊，自察熱山東，開往東北者甚多，此舉與和字第一號命令不舍。</p>
<p>〔本報北平廿一日電〕焦作煤礦糾紛，仍未解決，中共已將該處大部機器拆遷山西晋城，石家莊執行小組已赴焦作，試闆解決糾紛。</p>
<h3>五十二軍向撫順推進　我鞏固瀋陽外圍　物價低落電訊仍時有阻滯</h3>
<p>〔本報北平廿一日電〕五十二軍趙公武部，正向撫順推進中。進入瀋陽我軍，刻正謀鞏固瀋陽外國，附近縣份，近可逐步接收。杜聿明療治情形良好，過內可望出院，移地休養。</p>
<p>〔本報潘陽廿一日電〕四平街，撫順，遼陽方面蘇軍撤退後，我大軍正分頭念進，以便迂速接防，日內當可另換一新局面。撫順共軍約五萬餘，林彪親自指揮。四平街遼陽方面人數亦多。瀋陽國軍防區擴大，十九日起糧價已呈低落，赤金則跌價駁甚，兩日內跌三千餘元，原因在於蘇軍過去搜購頗多。又傳瀋陽已成東北軍政中心，由北寗路北來人民，紛紛到達，爭以黃金求售所致。茲誌十九日物價如下：赤金每兩一萬六千元，白銀每斤一千五百元，大米每斤二十元，麵粉每斤二十二元，高梁米每斤六元，豬肉每斤三十上八元，法幣折合流通券，黑市十四元對一。</p>
<p>〔本報瀋陽廿一日電〕瀋陽間電話及有綫電報，十八日下午三時半起，被阻不通，因沿途經公主嶺等地共軍區域故也。十九日下午甫通話，旋又被遮　。據云：四平街電訊設備，已被共軍破壞。四平街蘇軍撤退後，遼北省主席劉瀚東，十八日率隨員離去，近日可能再前往。現瀋長間每日僅有二小時無綫電報聯絡。</p>
<p>〔路透社重慶廿一日電〕中國外交部次長劉　，昨在記者會上稱：中國政府迄未接獲蘇聯關於蘇軍局部退出東北，或最後撤退日期之正式通知。</p>
<p>〔合衆社瀋陽廿一日電〕蘇軍雖已於王星期退出瀋陽，蘇聯仍假自俄之手，暗中操從此昔日工業大城之經濟命脈。城中多數工廠及精美住宅懸掛蘇聯國旗，表示其爲蘇聯財產，華人不得染指。瀋陽市長董文琦，連日與蘇聯領事館人員商談此事。華人方面認爲蘇方於佔領期間，以軍用票自日人購買此等財產，實違反戰爭結束時之中蘇諒解精神。據可靠方面報吿：蘇軍七十人現仍留駐瀋陽，守衛蘇聯所收買工廠。又據報，蘇聯便衣軍人二百人，現仍逗留於藩陽。</p>
<h3>瀋長路運送國軍　蘇方種種藉詞仍謂不可能</h3>
<p>〔中央社長春廿一日念電〕此問蘇軍雖在迅速撤退中，然馬林諾夫斯基元帥之總部，至少在今後一星期內，不致撤離長春，此在董彥平特洛曾科本日會談時雙方所作之言辭中可以測知。</p>
<p>〔中央社長春廿一日電〕我軍事代表團，昨曾正式照會蘇方，準備即行利用瀋長鐵路，由瀋方面運輸軍隊，北來接防。蘇方立即覆照，表示原則同意，惟謂北平鼠疫流行，車輛不能通過。此外，並將破壞渾河鐵橋之責任，歸咎國軍，謂由於該橋之破壞，致使撫順之煤不能運入。又稱：長鐵路員，曾遭我方虐待，並有機車十二輛，爲我方扣留。在此等情况消除前，利用該路運輸中國軍隊，實不可能云。按利用中長鐵路運輸國軍前來接防問題，過去董彥平特洛曾科會談，曾屢次提及，並已於二月一日前，商獲正式協議，彼時蘇方並無任何異議，並曾一度由長鐵理事會令飭路局充分協助，我軍車代表國昨日所提之照會，乃係通吿性質並未要求蘇方答覆。</p>
<p>〔又電〕自長春以南，鐵路交通發生障碍後，此間物似日漸騰貴。以　歲十二月底爲基準，至三月二十日止，物價指數，最高已達四百五十，最低亦在一百二十以上。平均指數爲二百五十，較前年高漲一倍有半。</p>
<p>〔中央社長春廿日電〕遼北省政府主席劉瀚東及其僚屬，現經證明，仍居四平街，但已失去自由。前傳突圍他去之說不確。此一謎團，爲董團長彥平所首先揭露。董氏今晨十時，突接四平街電話，發話人爲遼北省府秘書長徐　，董氏初接電話，驚喜莫名，但甫經交談後，即知對方已深陷虎穴之中。先是，徐氏在電話中言：戰事已吿給束，省府人員均安。董氏立即謂：你在那兒打電話？據稱：我在電話局。董氏先詢：你們究竟怎樣？徐氏稍停答稱：現在不能講，我不講你可明白。徐氏並稱：渠自昨晚，即開始向長春呼呌電話，但迄今晨始通話。徐氏除述上述數語外，夫言其他。</p>
<h3>華北之整軍入凖備階段</h3>
<p>〔本報北平廿一日電〕華北整軍工作，已入準備階段，十一戰區孫連仲長官定廿五日起前往南口，淸河，長辛店檢閱十六軍。</p>
<h3>北平文化女漢奸　尹梅伯判刑五年　曾又女學生向日軍送禮</h3>

<h3>新行動與提高警覺</h3>
<p>中國國民黨二中全會的召開，本報曾著論有所論列，其言曰：「查三民主義爲我國建國最高指導原則，原爲各黨各派所接受，則如何實行三民主義五權憲法本應不成問題產；可是這次政協會議所成立的協議，頗有違反三民主義及五權憲法的精神的，如關於五院制度及省的地位者均是。五權憲政爲國父給予中國人民之一大遺產，條列謹嚴，其目的在挽救西洋議會政治之弊，爲三民主義立一健全的政治體制，不容誤會曲解。此次政協會議對憲草所爲之協議，將三民主義所欲建立的政治體制予以支離宰划；若果付諸實施，將使五十年來國民黨的努力盡付東流。此其危機，實遠甚於民元時代袁之陰謀。……中國人民値長期戰爭之後，亟欲有安定的秩序，俾有生養休息的機會。此番國民黨中央委員集於陪都，希望能於接受政協成果之中，保全三民主義的精神」。其後二中全會圓滿閉幕，頒發宣言，曾有曾曰：一我們對於政治協商會議的各項協議，經過了詳寗而鄭重的檢討。我們鑒於國內和平安定與精誠團結的必要，以及同咆的痛苦必須解除，國家基礎的必須穩定，對於政治協商會議各項協議，都願以最大的誠意與各黨派及社會人士　誠相與，協力一致，以促其實行。但是我們所必須堅持的，就是憲法草案的條正，必須符合五權憲法的遺教。這因爲是三民主義與五權憲法是不可分割的，放棄了五權憲法，則三民主義便不能完全　　。所以本黨對於五權憲法必當遵奉保持，終始無間，這實在是爲着國家久遠的利害，希望各黨派和社會人士明瞭我們的立塲，了解我們的主張」。</p>
<p>本報之作上項論列，完全是其於人民的立塲，並不是對國民黨懷有特殊好感。這是基於下列的幾種理由的：（一）三民主義之爲各黨各派所遵奉，是已從國民黨一黨之私變爲全國人民之公，則本報自應本三民主義之精神，爲保全三民主義之呼籲；（二）中國的民族解放運動與國民黨結着歷史的深緣，而國民黨却負有防衛三民主義的重責，是以不能不於其召開二中全會之際，提供我們的觀感以備採擇；（三）中國人民經長期的抗戰以後，需要安定，惟有在公認三民主義的政治體制下，纔可以避免政治上的紛爭，所以我們不能不將這種心情表達出來。我們看到二中全會的宣言而感到欣慰，因爲其中關於政協及五權憲法部門，適符我們對於二中全會的期望；就是於「接受政協成果之中，保全三民主義的精神」。然而正當我們稍稍感到舒慰的時候，却看到有中國共產黨代表周恩來氏的指摘，說是二巾全會的決議，動搖了政治協商的協議。察其用意，似在移轉破壞政協協議的責任於國民黨，以爲國民二中全會將政治協商的協議予以毁棄，是其蓄意破壞政協成果，實甚明顯。</p>
<p>周氏之議一出，即糧我宣傳部部長吳國楨及中央黨部秘書長吳鐵城加以糾正。我們於此，不欲再所論列，不過其中有幾點，却必須加以指陳：</p>
<p>（一）中國國民黨有防衛三民主義的責任，還政於民實施憲政是國民黨一貫的夙願；但於還政於民實施憲政之際，如有對於三民主義發生誤會曲解，國民黨自屬有權，加以指陳或糾正。這次政協成果，國民黨之願衷心接受，具見全會宣言，但對於曲解三民主義部份自不得不起而糾正；</p>
<p>（二）問題的焦點，如果是有問題的話，是在於將來的憲法。關於政治體制的決定，權屬制憲會議，此在中國，就是行將召開的國民大會。從法理上講，任何憲草，任何關於草憲的協議，都不能拘束國民大會制憲的權責。即使沒有國民黨二中全會的指陳，政治協商所成立的關於憲草部門的協議，亦未能作爲定本，周氏所說：二中全會的決議，動搖了政治協商的協議；此其用意，顯在限制國民大會的權責，顯在限制全民行使其公意。今政府及國民黨之接受政協成果，原有道義上的責任；從法理上講，國民大會及以後由國民大會所產生的政府，自無接受政協成果的義務與責任，但這是另一回事。</p>
<p>各黨各派在政協能捐棄私見，成立協議，是可以欣慰的。所成立的協議必須付諸實施，那亦是毫無問題的事；此觀乎國民黨全會的決議及政府的措施，便可知其端的。三民主義旣爲各黨各派所公認，但防衛三民主義變質的責任，却落在國民黨，國民黨爲此而有必要的措施，亦是分內事。此番中共發動宣傳攻勢，旨在拖護共黨即將採取的新行動。誠如吳鐵城秘書長所云：「中共每一大規模宣傳攻勢，即緊接一新行動。今日中共宣傳攻勢之後，將有何種新行動發生，未可預料，試就東北問題之發展，及統編方案之實施兩事，加以汴意，或可視察其動向。」我們要提高國人對中共的警覺。</p>

<h3>奸逆年有企業股份　處置辦法通過　未判決者盈利送處理局扣押　已判決者依照市價結算處分</h3>
<p>蘇浙皖處理敵僞產業審議會，昨日通過奸逆所有企業股份處置辦法，其要點爲：凡經主管政府機關，如各省市政府及法院等檢舉逮捕之漢奸及附逆份子，出資而使用化名或其眷屬名義投資之股份，經證明爲奸逆所有者，該企業負責人對於奸逆特有之股份，不得任意過戶轉讓，並不得存侵害該奸逆股東權益之行爲。如有盈利分派股本發還等情事，該企業應即將奸逆股份應得部份呈送處理局，予以扣押。至奸逆已經法院判決處刑沒收財產者，處理局對於其所有股份，應令知各該企業負責人呈報該企業之凈値及奸逆股份名下應佔得之金額，該股份如爲公司組織，由處理局依照市價，將該項股票處分，如爲合夥，應視爲退夥，就其凈値予以結算。又奸逆股份占企業股份總額半數以上者，處理局得先予接收保管，必要時並得依照法定程序，令其停業淸算。此外審議會復通過撥付返國華工及眷屬遣散費撫恤命四億四千餘萬元及撥付武田藥廠工人遣散費若干萬元。</p>
<h3>我修正新公司法案　美商在華營業不致遭受影響</h3>
<p>宋孫兩院長致高爾德氏函</p>
<p>（本報訉）據英文大美晚報主筆高爾德氏昨接行政院長宋子文及立法院長孫科兩氏來函，證實美國所頒行之中國貿易條例，仍將綱續生效。國府對新公司法之修改，亦將避免對美國在華之公司，</p>
<p>有所歧視。宋院長之來函，條十九日發自重慶，其小有語略稱：一國府今日迨已實施，使中國貿易條例下之各美國公司仍能繼續營業。」孫院長之來函，亦係於同日發自重慶，中除對該報最近若干社論，有所評述外，有語稱：　昨日最高國防會議召開會議時，將主席未到，由余主席，足下對新公司法之規定，將影響中國貿易條例各美國公司之疑慮，</p>
<p>終告冰釋。蓋補救之修正案，業已成立。一俟立法院將最後之修正案，完成立法程序後，即將由國府頒行。　宋孫兩院長常望各外那人士明瞭，中國對外邦人士之參加建國工作，極表歡迎。同時亦望美國明瞭，中國對在華之美國公司，並無歧視之意。按新公司法草案原來之條文中，曾規定</p>
<p>在華營業之外國公司，該外國公司在其本國，亦須有營業，而美國所頒行之中國貿易條例，則明白規定：根據該條例在華設立之美國公司，該公司等不得在美營業。故如將新公司法原草案付諸實施，除根據中國貿易條例在華經營之美國公司，其存在及經營爲不法外，即其他會經在美註册之公司，亦將</p>
<p>遭受影響。蓋有許多在美國達萊衛州註册之公司，其目的僅爲在華營業便利而來，初無在美營業之意。最近重慶方面，對新公司法修改之訊，雖時有所傳，大多消息不詳，或相矛盾，今觀宋孫兩院長之函，眞相常可大白。</p>

<h3>本月生活指數　勢必較上月爲高　但不致相距過遠</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕各界注目之本月份生活指數，將於四月一日正式公佈。社會局工資評議會，曾向市府建議，生活指數每月分兩次公佈，然因編造手續過繁，卒遭否決。昨記者趨訪市政府硏究室蔡正雅氏，據稱：本月一般物價比上月爲高，生活指數亦勢必增高，但生活必需中之水電，房租等，因政府嚴加限制，未曾漲價，而此種物品，人人必需，不可或缺，在生活指數中所佔百分比極大，故本月份之物價雖較上月爲高，但其總指數比之上月當不致相距甚遠也。</p>
<h3>麵粉普售量减少　原因大半爲運輸關係</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕記者頃自行政院善後救濟總署滬分署探悉：行總平價出售之麵粉，除第一批，係全由美國碾磨裝袋運華者外，以後各批，運來均係美麥，由我國麵粉廠磨製麵粉，但此類麵粉廠，有若干設於無鍋等埠，有時因運輸關係，未能準期來滬。復次美麥來華，亦有愆期情形，例如有一批，原定運華，臨時忽改運歐洲，以致此間平售蒙受影響。而上海所存麵粉中之一部，尙須配與若干工廠，故普遍發售之數量，又不免减少。惟日來蔣廷敝氏正在聯總大會，出席會議，當不致令此次戰爭中災情最重災區最廣之我國失望也。又行總執行長劉鴻生，已正式就職，蔣署長出國期間，一切公事即由劉氏代拆代行。</p>

<h3>社會局勸喻工人　勿號召羣衆麕集　只須推派代表到局商議</h3>
<p>社會局負責方面對於勞資糾紛調解問題，昨發表談話，勸吿工人。略謂：工人發生勞資爭議，時有不依法推派代表來局商請調解，而動軋召集羣衆，　集本局，以致資方恐受無理包圍，不敢到局參加調解，結果徒然遷延時日，惹起糾紛。作繭自縛，於工人本身反而不利。深望此後工人方面，深明此義，遇有爭議事件，只須推派代表來局商議，絕對不許再號召羣衆，集中本局。吾則資方因恐包圍而不出席調解，其遷延責任，應由勞方自己負之。</p>

<h3>市府民政處報告市參議員選舉事項　分地區選舉及團體選舉兩種</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕市府民政處處長張曉崧，副處長兼上海市臨市參議會秘書長項昌權，民政處，李學訓及社會局第二處處長王家樹，昨日下午三時，會同在市府會議室招待本市記者，對報吿本市自治機稱，及有關選舉問題。</p>
<p>選舉方法</p>
<p>上海市參議員選舉大會，定於四月二十八日在南昌路一一〇號揭幕。選舉市參議員，依據民國三十四年一月國府頒布法令，應分地區選舉及職業團體選舉兩種。前者爲主，額名佔百分之七十，後者爲副，佔百分之三十。地區選舉，採用直接選舉，職業團體則採間接選舉。按本市人口比例，區代表名額將有一百二十餘名，職業團體代表將有五十名左右。</p>
<p>地區選舉</p>
<p>地區選舉人之資格，凡屬中華民國國民，年滿二十歲，在本區內居住六月以上，或曾在本區住宿一年以上者，均得有公民資格而獲選舉權。但曾被檢舉之漢奸及曾在僞政府任蕳任以上之官員，則不得參與。選舉手續，每五保設一所，投票人應親自前往，由該所將其國民身份證審核後，當塲發票塡寫。至</p>
<p>團體選舉</p>
<p>職業團體選舉，以職業爲單位。現有單位分農，工，商，敎育，漁會及自由職業。選舉分兩度，初選由同業公會每會選出三人，自由職業現包括七八種，亦由每一種團體選出，須有三年以上會員資格之代表三人，然後覆選一人，但漁會及敎育會，因組織簡單，採直接投票。職業國體選舉資格，須（一）現在從事本業者，方可參加，（二）以一個團體爲限。</p>
<p>候選資格</p>
<p>候選人之資格：參加競選者須經過考試或檢核參加競選人之資歷證明文件。考試方法，採取直接口試及筆試。但上海市爲便於公民參加競選起見總不採取考試方法而用檢核蹬件。如未經審核者，即當選亦屬無效。審核事宜，由市府組織委員會辦理。</p>
<p>投票方式</p>
<p>投票時爲避免少數人操縱，一票僅能選一人，取無記名密封辦法。開票時則請指定專家，集中公開開票。候補人數與正式參議員相等，選舉結果整理後呈內政部長核定，當選人有參政自由權，如不願當選者則另選之</p>
<p>登記日期</p>
<p>選舉前籌備日期，至少需四十天，前十日爲公吿期，自三月廿八日起開始登記，至四月十三日截止，凡欲參加選舉者，務於此時期內辦理登記手續，逾期不參加登記者，不得享受選舉權或被選舉權。</p>
<p>同業公會整理辦法</p>
<p>社會局對於各業同業公會規定調整辦法。（一）復負：抗戰期間未參加僞方工作或雖在僞組織下任理監事而無其他犯罪行爲者，則仍准其恢復原有狀態。（二）整理：雖係合法，但內部不健全者，由政府指定人員整理。（三）由同業推選代表發起重行籌備。發現性質相同之各公會，則依法應統一合成一團體，調整將於四月內全部完成。又本市劃分區域現加真如區共爲三十二區。</p>
<h3>市府上月份收支　不敷六萬萬元　市政當局擬呈請撥補</h3>
<p>上海市政府市政經費殊爲支絀，收入不敷支出。本年二月份各部門支出情形如下：市政府總務處，計二六九，六二五，三六〇·〇〇元。民政處計五二，〇〇〇，〇〇〇·〇〇元。會計處計五二，九六二，九七〇·〇〇元。警察局計三七七，一五五，六九六·〇〇元。財政局計八九，三一五，九二一·〇〇元。敎育局計一九八，四二二，八九三·〇〇元。衛生局計二五三，九八一·〇四八·〇〇元。公用局計一一七，六八四，六九五·〇〇元。工務局計一九八，〇九〇，〇〇九·〇〇元。社會局計二三，七三三，六九〇·〇〇元。地政局計六七，二八六，五二〇·〇〇元。統計處計一，五四二，四〇〇·〇〇元。外加警備司令部保衛委員會等機關經費，及借款利息等支出，共計國幣一，八八六七，二七九，一一三·二六元。但二月份全部收入，包括稅課收入，中央分配稅款收入，規費收入等收入，共計爲國幣一，二六七，八〇六，二一一·五八元。二月份收支相抵，的超支國幣六萬萬元。是項超支之數，聞市政當局擬呈請撥補。</p>
<h3>接收台省工廠　亟需技術人員　省公署盼能源源前往　煤米糖均由政府統制</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕台灣省行政長官公署駐滬通訊處主任包可閎，頃吿記者稱：台北輪以卸貨不及竣事，昨日改由招商局派海宇。海宙。二輪駛台。該二輪均係自由輪，重的萬噸。海宙載有公署及黨部人員頗多，彼等留滬已久，有候綸已達數月者。至於運台貨物，則仍將由台北輪裝運，其中多爲「行總」救濟品，如麵粉等物。此外尙有公署所購之肥料豆餅及工礦器材。</p>
<p>三千噸糖裝運來滬</p>
<p>滬台航程約二日夜可達，途中極爲安全。日前由台來滬之台北輪，原係日輸大洋丸，此輪共載來瑭三千噸，煤六百噸，茶葉及若干水果。若船上設備完善，水果當可大量來滬。台省四季皆產西瓜，甘甜肥大，與蘇浙所產不相上下，將來亦可源源而來，全滬人大快朶頤。　台灣附近每年有飚風二次，海峽內航行允難，故屆時機帆船恐將不能通航。</p>
<p>艙位不多限制旅客</p>
<p>若干不明眞相人士，每有台省封鎖太甚之誤會，實則皆以交通工　缺乏之故。台灣爲我國國土，任何國人皆可前往。目前赴台旅客之所以必需先由公署審核者，乃以艙位有限，欲使接收人員儘早前往，俾得早復常態之故。現在台省工廠之接收，係用一監理』辦法，原有技工一概留任，照常工作，僅由公署派員監督，務期生產不致停頓。但留台日僑短期內皆將遺送回日，改由國人接管，故台省長官公署實亟盼技術人員能源源前往也。</p>
<p>數萬噸煤候輪裝出</p>
<p>目前統制之貨品，爲謀·米·糖三種。煤係由燃料管理委員會統制，現有六七萬噸，在基隆候輪裝出。米則台省目前每斤台幣二十元，折合法幣須六十元，即每祖須六萬元之鉅。故決無輸出之可能。糖則因台省土壤五年未經施肥，本年幾無出產，而上海近來百物昂貴，糖價尙廉，實即台糖來滬之故。省公署希望以此僅剩之物產，交換台省急需之肥料。</p>
<p>至於匯兌，公署現暫定每一台幣換法幣三十元，現正向財政部請核定中。</p>
<h3>招商局機帆船　擬撥民營公司</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕戰事期內，民營船舶損失奇重。勝利後，各民營輪船業，組織戰時船舶損失要求賠償委員會，會推代表赴渝，呈請政府要求賠償。雖政府對原則接受，但迄今尙無具體辦法。現悉爲暫時補助民營航業起見，招商局擬將南京分局接收而出租之「風」字號機帆船的五十艘，即行收回撥交民營公司經營。上項計劃，下月初即可實現。其餘「浦」字等機帆船，亦將陸續收問。</p>

<p>〔本報訉〕最近若干航輪來滬，均無碼頭及浮筒可靠，影響本市對外貿易，殊非漢鮮。記者爲明瞭實情計，特趨訪本市中華碼頭股份有限公司總經理劉念智氏，據告：本市碼頭及浮筒，數量並不稀少，將實際可供應用者爲數不多。揆厭原因：（一）最近外洋駛來船隻，吃水平均多在二十尺左右，本市一般碼頭，均感不敷應用。（二）浦江挖泥工作，停頓已有八年之久，故河泥淤積日高，而挖泥之設備及船隻，目下又極匱乏。（三）大部之碼頭倉庫，均堆置敵僞產業處理局之物品，故須待該項物品處理出淸，方可供用。（四）有一部份碼頭或則燬於兵焚，或則因敵僞盤踞多年，耗損過度，亟待修理，方可供用。據統計：目下浦東浦西兩岸之碼頭，國營者有五個，華商方面有十個，原屬敵方者有十二個，英商方面有十三個，美商方面有二個。其中以英商之碼頭情形較好，其他碼頭，實際可供用者頗少，大部須待修理整新。現利用碼頭最多者，爲盟軍及「聯總」之船只。浦江中之浮筒，現亦每經盟軍艦艇泊用，故可供商用者甚少目。下唯一補救辦法：（一）火速進行挖泥工作，（二）積極修理各碼頭·渠又稱：上海如欲成爲一進出口貿易之要埠，浦東浦西之間，必須構築橋樑一兩座。落成後，浦東之碼頭可大批供用，貨物之搬運費亦可因而减低，於本市貿易之促進，將大有裨益。</p>
<h3>外輪行駛長江　須懸我國國旗</h3>
<p>據悉：太古·怡和兩公司江輪如康定·萬流·沙市·吉和·新昌和·等五艘，屢次企國假備裝運行政院救濟總署救濟物資名義，行駛我國長江一帶。行總署以英輪行駛沿海，已發現流弊，損害航權，上述各江輪，並不在租賃範圍以內，特提抗辯。雖經外商再三要求，迄未允准。現純行總署決定，如外商江輪向我長江一帶行駛，須一律縣掛中國國旗，方能同意。我國航業界對此措施，咸感欣慰。</p>

<h3>皖少教育概況　受教兒童佔百分之六十六　不添增普通中學添設職校</h3>

<p>日前記者因了偶然的機會，得以會見一批抗戰被俘新近回國的同胞，在和他們簡略的談話中，知道他們被俘經過被迫做苦工以及如何回國等情形的梗槪，茲就見聞所及，報導於讀者之前：</p>
<p>驚異　同情　可敬</p>
<p>前大下午，我從徐州城里出來看見前面有一段短短的隊伍在行進着，他們都是穿“軍的呢軍服，和軍用大衣，旁邊有幾個穿灰棉軍服的國軍在護送着。我想：這是新繳了械的日軍，解到集中管理所去的吧？當我走近他們時，諦聽着他們隊伍里發出來的語聲，竟是中國語；我走到他們前面去看看他們的面貌，不見有落腮鬍子的人，還有他們的帽徽，都是靑天白日的。不由得呌我懷疑了：一、他們究竟是敵人呢？是同胞？</p>
<p>他們在××總部的大門口的曠塲上停下來了，那個護送者中的排長之類，進去了一下，就有一位官員拿着公文及名單來點名了，一共是八十八名。點過了名，他們都很疲憊似的席地坐下，談的純粹是中國語，這時，我認定他們是中國人；日本人的服裝，遮飾不了中國人的本質。</p>
<p>對着敵俘，就馬上會記起了仇恨，對着同胞，尤其是這一羣異樣的裝束，和疲乏的可憐的同胞，馬上就起了同情。同時急切地想知道他們的來歷，我就揀那個神色較旺的問起來了。</p>
<p>「我們是抗戰被俘到敵國，新近回來的。」他見我去問他，就興奮的給我一個肯定的答案，這使我在先而可怪，中而可憐的心情上，添上了可敬的成分了。</p>
<p>但是，這個回答不能滿足我的要求，我要知道詳細而比較有系統的，我亦不顧他們精神的疲憊，追問他們的經過和現在的目的</p>
<p>「前年（三十三年）四月裏，我們在河南抗戰，被敵人俘去；同年八月，把我們送到日本去做苦工；戰事結束了，於去年（三十四）十一月，由美國人用軍艦把我們送到青島，再由靑島市政府把我們送到海州。因爲海州到這邊交通不便，所以由海州的國軍派人護送我們到這裏。我們目前惟一的想頭是回家，但是，我們都是河南等處人氏，一時還回不了家，身邊又沒有錢，希望當局能救濟我們！」</p>
<p>顯然他是說得很疲乏了，他們還說六七個鐘頭沒吃過東西了呢！恰好××總部派人來招待他們了，他們趕着要吃飯休息，我問明他們的住處，的好明天再去看他們。</p>
<p>次日上午，我就走到北關一神社』附近的那座洋房裏去看他們，－－那房子以前確是日兵住的－－先找着昨天那個排頭像隊長模樣的呌姜順昌的，他和其他許多人都在太陽底下取暖談天，精神比昨天好多了。他們看見我去，像認識了的朋友一樣的親密，我就亦同他們坐在那階石上和他們談。</p>
<p>我先就問起他們的籍貫和他們原來隸屬的部隊，原來他們這八十八個人常中，大多是河南人，原屬部隊則不同，有些說是胡宗南將軍部下的。</p>
<p>「誰說胡宗南的部隊只防共不抗日呢？不抗敵怎的會被敵俘擄呢？」當我將一點傳說質之他們，他們憤憤地說。</p>
<p>在死亡綫上苦門</p>
<p>這裏讓筆者把他們你一句我一句所說的話聯成一段關於他們被俘的情形：</p>
<p>在三十三年的三四月裏，河南的（戰事很激烈，這次我們被俘了，但敵人死傷亦很重的。</p>
<p>記得是四月廿四日吧，我們被俘，把我們關到洛陽集中營裏，給我們許多苦頭吃；每天只給我們每人二十七粒生玉米（玉蜀黍），又不給水，怎生吃得呢？在那裏就死了許多，病了許多，到五月裏，把我們開走，都要我們步行，從洛陽步行到彰德府，（按即豫北安陽）路上走不動，被打死了一些，又病死了一些。到彰德府上車，敵人怕我們跳車，就把我們用繩子綑起來，串起來，又把車的門釘住。我們在車廂裏又熱又悶又擠，有些就悶死在車上了，到石家莊（河北）停了幾天，有逃的，就常塲打死。</p>
<p>要把我們築中到塘沽，預備送到日本去，所以從石家莊起又要走路了。那已經是夏天了，日子長，每天只給我們七兩麵粉，分三餐吃，從來沒有一頓吃飽的；在塘沽連淡水都不給我們喝，要我們喝黑水（海水。鹽水），怎叫人走得動路？路上的痛苦，眞說不完：直到入月初才到達塘沽，計算我們同時同地被俘的二百多人裏，只賸了七十多人了，其餘都是餓死，打死，病死了！</p>
<p>當時我們預計着來日大難，尙無休止，眞亦不想活下去了，只有死路一條，但是總覺得只要活着，總還有報仇雪恥的一綫希望的，所以我們忍受着，等待着敵人擺佈。</p>
<p>八月十一日吧！我們和其他各戰塲被俘的同胞幾萬人，都已先後集中到塘沽了，於是敵人把我們押上軍艦，載到日本去。</p>
<p>眼看着自己被活生生地迫離了祖國，而到敵人的國土裏去，我們心裏十分難過，大家不禁流出了眼淚。</p>
<p>黑地獄中受苦難</p>
<p>到了日本，已經先有幾批和我們同命運的同胞在着了，敵軍把這些被俘的同胞，分派到各區－－本州·九州·四國·北海道－－去替他們做苦工，就把我們交給雷地的警察及憲兵來管理了。</p>
<p>苦工的種類大概是築路·開礦。開隧道等，我們是被派去挖山洞（隧道）的。</p>
<p>工作的種類雖然不同，但管理及待遇大致差不多。</p>
<p>就在山里或野村，劃出一個區域給我們住，每天一早趕我們去工作，到晚趕我們回來歇，從不讓我們與外界接觸，管理得非常嚴格，我們正像在地獄里一樣暗無天日，我們自己亦不以自己在過着人的生活了。</p>
<p>我們穿的，不論冬夏，都是那套破單軍服，不補發你一點衣，鞋襪亦沒有，大家整大終年赤着脚。在山洞裏（或者礦區里）天熱時，像火燒，冷時凍冰，我們是人，如何受得了！聽說派在北海道的，幾乎凍死了半數以上。</p>
<p>吃的，最好的算是每天八兩麵粉，平常都是每天半斤豆餅，甚至就要我們吃大米糠，－糠內沒有米的，就是把糠硏細的－如果你生病不能工作了，他就只給你平常的一半，因爲你不做工，他就用不着給你做工應得的享受。試想一個病了的人，又不能得到維持生命所需的食物，常然只有病重而至於死了。</p>
<p>管理的警察憲兵，都如狼如虎，施給我們種種虐待，稍一不遂，鞭笞隨之，我們同胞間不能隨便說話，說話亦不准大聲，眞是　若寒虫，比坭土里的寒虫還不如！</p>
<p>遠托異國，皆人所悲，而况我們現在旣在異國，而且是敵國，又要我們替敵人做工，又給我封鎖在這樣的地獄里，過牛馬都不如的生活，這樣，我們痛苦上加上痛苦，仇恨上添上仇恨！</p>
<p>今天重見天日了</p>
<p>這是我們記住的日子，因爲這是我們重見天日的日子！三十四年的八月十五日上午八點鐘，我們得到了日本無條件投降的消息。在這之先，我們覺得敵憲兵及警察們，神色有些異常了；後來有一個朝鮮的工人，他吿訴我們說：「日本已經投降了」？</p>
<p>這眞使我們驚喜若在，我們一回想對着笑，一回相抱着哭，眞不知如何來形容我們那時的快活。</p>
<p>本來，我們對外界的消息隔絕的，偶而有幾個朝鮮工人，拿進張把日文報紙來，也是一種假的宣傳，而且日文我們都是認不到的，只有從其中幾個中國字裏去想意思。</p>
<p>然而，這個勝利的消息，却不知怎的會這樣快就傳到我們耳鼓裏了、好消息似有翅膀，特別傳得快！</p>
<p>這樣，我們就等着解放了，敵人對我們亦稍爲不同了。</p>
<p>不久，美軍來了，那是我們正式解放的日子了，把我們遷到城鎭裏的房子裏去住，衣服亦換了一下。當我們離開那地獄式的苦工區時，內心亦有了異常的感覺。</p>
<p>在過去，我們對敵國人仇視，輕視而不敢發，也從不和他們接近，解放後我們看到以前虐待我們的警察憲兵就要打，美軍初不來干涉，等我們打了後，才來勸，把敵人的警察憲兵拖開去，叫他們不要來討挨打。</p>
<p>後來，參加中國作戰的日兵亦有些回國了，我們聽見有對我們說中國話的日兵就打，因爲斷定他們是打中國人的敵人。</p>
<p>美軍和我們到底是朋友，勝利後就由他們發給我們衣服及糧食，使我們生活過得比較好。平常見面亦很客氣，看到你是中國兵，他會和你握手；有時你可以搭他們的吉普　去進，他們會邀你云喝酒，看他們的電影。</p>
<p>一年來的積氣，到此總算一伸，覺得有了報應的快慰？同時便更熱愛祖國，念着祖國，想回到祖國，——勝利的祖國！</p>
<p>侵略者們的命運</p>
<p>他們說到這裏，我就要他們吿訴我一點日本國內的情形，他們說他們所到過地方不多，詳細情形，不大淸楚，首先看到的，是經過東京等處，那裏是所謂都市，大都是瓦礫塲了，這是在戰時盟國飛機轟炸的結果，據說大阪，橫濱諸大都市，都遭到同樣的命運，可以說　華已毁了。</p>
<p>其次是在日本國內，很少看到壯年男子了，所有行政，敎育，交通等機關，差不多都是由婦女擔任工作，如公務員，教師，開車的司機，店舖夥計等，都只見是女的。國內沒有看見兵，治安的責任，完全由憲兵警察維持，憲兵和警察則全是男性的。從此亦可以看出他們兵員徵補之窮竭，另一方面可以看出他們婦女工作能力的强。</p>
<p>在勝利以前，雖然有厭戰的現象，但對於這所謂「大東亞戰爭」，他們仍有勝利的信念，他們的訓練和敎育，原來亦就帶有侵略性的。</p>
<p>日本國內的工廠，都停了工，軍需品的生產也不多，其他更不必說了，所以一般都有物資缺乏的感覺，人民的生活亦過得很苦。</p>
<p>當美軍初到日本時，日本國內的人尤其是婦女，大多懷着恐懼心理，住慣了，就此較好多了。</p>
<p>現在，什麼都在美軍指示下，遂漸改造來了！</p>
<p>回到祖國的懷抱</p>
<p>接下去，他們就說到這次回國前後的情形：</p>
<p>我國作戰被俘的同胞，被送在日本的，恐怕在十五萬人以上，（不確）有些在礦區及山洞裏死掉了，這十幾萬人，籍貫以河南，河北，山東等省較多，北方其他各省及柬北次之。勝利後，中國就派員洽辦遣回戰俘的事，經美軍的協助，用軍艦分批送回，依籍貫分批在塘沽，大連及靑島等處登岸，解散回鄉。</p>
<p>我們大的是第二三批，是去（三十四年）年十一月卅日，在日本上船，十二月一日開離海埠，同月五日抵達靑島。</p>
<p>當美軍遣送我們回國以前，發給我們冬衣並川資每人一百元日幣，到了靑島，兌作國幣一千元，並由靑島市長給我們每人一張返國僑民證明書。</p>
<p>青島市長派人送我們在十二月二十日到了海州。在靑島時，食住都有招待的到了海州亦有人招待，因爲海州到徐州交通未復，乃由駐海州國軍某師，派官兵護送我們，在路上走多了日子，錢亦化光了，一路來甚爲函苦，　而今天已到達徐州。　一個沉痛的尾聲</p>
<p>一個沉痛的尾聲</p>
<p>談話到這裏，木來可以售　跚東，但我聽了上面這些話，可　可敬的同情心，汕然而生；我　了他們　覺得不忍馬上離開他們，覺得情有未能已於言者，他們亦像還有很多話要對一個認識的朋友　似的。經過幾秒鐮的沉默，就有一個人沉重的開口了。</p>
<p>他說：「我們原來都是家鄉的老百姓，是父母的兒子在戰役中沒有戰死，被俘長途沒有拖死，遺往敵國做苦工受虐待沒有死，今天抗戰勝利，我們重見天且，我們可又說是活三世了。我們對于作戰被俘，深覺慚愧；現在尚能生還，甚感慶幸，而對國家抗戰勝利，極爲興奮愉快：從此益增我們愛國熱忱！</p>
<p>「我們被俘後，沒有和家鄉通過信，家裏父母親友，正以抗戰勝利，而担着兒子存亡未卜的　念，此次我們滿望回國後就可重返故園，叙天倫之樂，誰知，音先就遇着交通的破壞，增加我們的困難；我們的家鄉又未綏靖，弄得有家　不街，而生活甚，眞使人內心如煎！想們爲抗戰而吃了苦，今日却有人破壞國家抗戰勝利的成果，不使一嘗此種樂果，又令人心痛！</p>
<p>「尤其當回國後看到我們黨局，對敵俘如此寬大優待，看到他們的衣食豐裕，神氣十足，對比之下，眞不知該作何感想！</p>
<p>「希望當局能體念我們的苦忱，給予有效的救濟！」</p>
<p>本來，我是爲想得到一些新的見聞而興奮，此刻聽了他們這段話，心理覺得非常不安。然而事實是如此，我想什麽話云安他們道些可敬的戰士呢？</p>
<p>我只得向他們道別，約定有機會再去看他們，就邊走邊思索，拖着滯重的脚步回來了。</p>
<p>「希望常局給予有效的救濟。』我也這樣喊。（三，十）</p>
<h3>渡黃河　巡視新鄉安陽</h3>
<p>— 本報十三日航訊　范世勤寄</p>
<p>平漢綫過了廣開武，就有荒凉之感。兩面的山，沒有樹林，最多有一二株禿樹點綴着，所又看去總是一片黃色，極爲單調。而且風沙滿大，天地也成一個顏色。山上山下，連草屋都沒有，僅有的是幾個山洞，山洞裏右時鐀出一二個衣服襤褸動作遲鈍的居民，這個鏡頭，或者是道地的中國鏡頭。</p>
<p>黃河南岸，敵人曾經擺過背水陣，岸左的山上，有個水塔。據說，那是敵人建築的。這個水塔，我們過去不曾發覺，因之，我們怎樣攻撃敵人，沒有撃退敵人，因爲敵人有了飲料，維持着戰鬥。南岸的山下，都有敵人永久的工事，堅固異常。金城湯池，堅壁固壘，最後還是靠不住，這是敵人始料所不及的。</p>
<p>車行黃河鐵橋上　計時三刻鐘</p>
<p>經過五分鐘的隧通，就到了黃河鐵橋。黃河鐵橘是中國除長城運河外的第三位大工程。火車通過鐵橋，計時四十五分鐘。　仕橋上行走，好像一個輪船在海洋裏行駛一樣。這橋在敵人佔領的時候，不知被我們炸壞了多少次。我們從橋上所修補的鐵條看起來，幾乎每丈之間曾經遭了彈炸。這橋旋炸旋修，旋修旋炸，不知經歷了多少次數。</p>
<p>水流正如八卦圖　令人雙目眩</p>
<p>黃河的水流，有緩有急，有前流，有倒流，有支流，有主流。在有沙礁的地方，或在較狹的地方，流的急，吾則流得緩。這水好像沒有一定方向，有路的前流，沒路的倒流；但是主流和支流在黃河鐵橋中間可以看得出，在四面看，這水好像八卦岡，使人且爲之眩。加之，有的是冰，有的是雪，有的是沙灘，水。冰。雪·沙·動的，靜的，搆成一個大圖案。</p>
<p>黃河兩岸，隱的的看到幾只停泊着的船以外，其餘一望無際，頗爲單調，在海洋中，時常還能看到一些海鷗，高翔來往，極其自在，但黃河中却見不到一禽一鳥。</p>
<p>塔崗高村橋兩外　電桿遭破壞</p>
<p>過了黃河，共產軍破壞交通的痕跡都在。沿途的電綫桿，矮矮的，不過五六尺長，就是因爲被砍了後再從新埋下去的，電綫桿上的磁瓶，打碎在地上，大有玉碎的表示。據路局方面說：由新鄉到安陽，是十月十三日開始修築，到十一月十五日才完成，中間屢修屢遭破壞。衛輝北的塔崗，湯陰南的高村橋，破壞最大，路工幾乎都遭不測。那些鐵軌，一搬搬到太行山下，吃虧的是老百姓，共產軍呌他們搬去，路局又呌他們搬回。</p>
<p>一個家庭，兩夫妻吵架，打壞東西，最是不智的事。這些東西，究竟都是一家的，將來大家和好，不是又要化錢去買嗎？</p>
<p>置身古羅馬時代　欣賞了碉堡</p>
<p>新鄉迤西四十里外的地區，就是有名的太行山，共產軍的根據地便在那裏。所以在鐵路的西面下碉堡，束面却沒有。這碉堡我很愛看，有各式各樣的，好像自已置身於占羅馬的時代。另外，也看到幾個敵人做的碉堡，堅固是堅固，但不够藝術味。國軍做的碉堡，就池取材，就材成形，旣經濟，又美觀，同時抵當共產軍的砲火也有餘。我總覺得這是不必要而必要的，所以一路以藝術眼光目之。</p>
<p>驅使老百姓作戰　罪責應自負</p>
<p>共產黨進攻過新鄉，進佔過過湯陰，威脅過安陽，談起來，很可怕，死的多是老百姓，那老百姓就是共產軍趕來在第一綫作戰的。共產軍的紀律很不差，不妄殺人，然而不殺之民，驅之作戰，成了殺人盈野的大罪。</p>
<p>我去豫北時，正是停止衝突命令發表以後，但前面都有或多或少的衝突。時間逐漸過去，衝突减少，但問題還相當多，而共產黨方面的宣傳，又是使我們莫明共妙，說這次停戰是由於山央無力再戰，政治協商會議已經決定將華北劃歸共產黨。諸如此類宣傳，在兩軍相接之處，常有聽到，但稍一離遠，我們也不明塊相，此類宣傳也不再入耳了。</p>
<p>豫北各縣情況苦　以新鄉爲例</p>
<p>在豫北新鄉這個地方，北倚太行，南襟大河，並臨平漢，道淸，汴新等幹綫，地勢很重要。汲縣有比　墓，湯陰有岳武穆廟，很能啓發人的正義感。安陽的袁世凱墓，及曹操在安陽後的飛黃　　，使人想起他們兩人類似的地方。湯陰之有岳武穆，安陽之有韓忠獻，那又是鄴下千古　　。湯陰又有　里城，文王廟，也很使人追念。</p>
<p>照河南的形勢說，以宛。洛。鄴。三地區著名。安陽即是鄴地，我看安陽所以認爲重要：一是南北之衝，一是產煤。棉。麥的關係。在另一方面，我們來看老百姓，實在太苦。豫北各縣卅一·卅二兩年單是旱災的損失，都在百分之八十以上；卅二年至卅四年虫災的損失，少則百分之四十，多則百分之九十。據說豫北待救的人民，至少有一百三十八萬九干餘人。</p>
<p>戰爭中損失怪重　糧食最恐慌</p>
<p>像新鄉一縣，在戰爭中被燬的房屋有六二、七九九間，被燬於共產軍也有三五、八四三間；倉糧在戰爭中損失的一七、八三七噸，損失於共奮軍的有五入二唱，損失於旱蝗的有五八四五〇噸·牛馬在細　中損失的有一二四七六頭，擭失於共產軍的有五二八頭。由新鄉一縣，可以看出豫北各縣情形。現在豫北　　　的是缺乏糧，尤其是湯陰，因湯陰被共產軍佔了十八天，每天又七百　大軍運搬糧食，弄得”前已空空如也。</p>
<p>現在豫北成了僵硬的蛇身一樣，動彈不得。只有在南面還可以呼吸呼吸，否則就要　息了。現在平漢路南段只到安陽，安陽北五里，就不安全了。</p>
<p>新鄉有個行政督察專員兼保安司令張敬忠，年卅餘歲，樣十像個小公務員，說話不驚人，舉動不老練，可是極可敬佩。他在　　中，由區長而縣長，由縣長而專員。他是新鄉附近的人，在豫北淪陷時，他首唱回豫北去，同敵人去搏鬥。他由區長而爲縣長，由縣長而爲專員，是親身奮鬥出米的。政府對於這個志士，一再擢升，是最切實的褒掦了。</p>
<h3>惟恐天下不亂之徒請看看死亡八百萬人遺跡　智利女詩人米斯特拉發表觀感</h3>
<p>利女詩人米斯特拉，曾議一九四五年度諾員爾文學獎金，現任駐洛杉磯領事。最近自英·法·瑞典·及義大利等國进　至此，據談遊歐觀感稱：洲方面現有一種危險趨勢，以爲第三次世界大　已不可免，「此類惟恐天下不亂之徒，應至各處看着死亡八百萬人之遣跡！」。米女士並稱道『英國民主政治，瑞典組織能力，法國始終愛好文　，即在可怖之職後猶然，此殊足令人驚異，義大利亦潛藏堅級精神，要不失爲歐陸拉丁民族國家中組織最善之一國」。惟此次戰爭中死亡枕藉，實令人難以忘懷。預防未來戰亂之唯一方法，端在使公衆充分明瞭國際時事，「不可以虛僞報道，引起驚惶」。各國作家與記者於此，責任允大，『均壓獻身爲眞理奮鬥」。法西斯主義現有死灰復燃之勢，具有善意之作家與前進人士，必須共同努力，吾人庶不致再被其淹沒。方今之世，杌　不安，亂僅載道，法西斯正擬乘人之危，躍躍欲試，不可不早爲之防。歐洲飢荒還地，美國對於瘡擄滿目之世界各國，在道義上實負有同類相助之義務。吾人茍欲挽救拉丁文化於此後五十年中不致殞滅，則南北美洲必須合力輸將，從事救濟。吾人如欲使後代子孫繼承和平再造工作，則歐洲之兒女必須援手救護。米女士最後稱：日內將赴華盛頓一行，然後再於五月回紐的，參加聯合國機稱締女小組委員會會議。（聯合社，紐約，十九日。）</p>

<h3>憶詩人楊雲史（續）</h3>
<p>— 湯立言</p>
<p>先生淸末曾任新嘉坡總領事，有哀南溟等詩可證。在南洋購地萬畝植橡樹，爲事之所有。惟其歸國在辛亥壬子之間，先生自謂遜國詔下，棄職而歸者也。或以代歐戰起，樹膠價暴落，橡園　爲茂草，更無遺貲納稅，橡林悉沒人官，乃踽踽而歸。誤矣。及後吳公兵敗，先生曾之瀋陽依張少帥，亦是事實。乃或謂先生　主杜聞人筆記則大誤。主社聞人筆記者，前有楊皙子（度），後有楊千里（　　）。雖皆姓楊，且爲一時名士，然與先生無與也。</p>
<p>先生少爲相府嬌客，淮軍舊將，朝夕相處。中年以後入吳將　幕，北洋軍人，知之允稔。予少受三民主義之熏陶，在尙未授室之年，受先總理特達之知。我兩人之環境截然不同，思想亦　，故議論每多不合。而先生獨虛衷釆納。嘗令予排日講演國民　黨史，而以閒話北洋舊事爲報。先生嗜阿芙蓉，一榻烟霞，除　山水外絕少出遊。長日無事，兩人各述其所見所聞，以消永畫，或撫準而笑，或喟然長咦。我兩人不會白頭宮女談開元天寳遣　也。</p>
<p>先生嘗謂吳梅村古之傷心人也。以尙未强代之年，慘遭　變。家無負郭之出，上有高堂，下有幼子。親友嚴裝速篤，涕泣就　，良非得已。即其代淸爲國子監祭酒，尙不脫書生本色。觀其病中作賀新凉詞，及遺命以僧服歛，題其墓碑曰詩人吳梅村之　，則共內疚神明，心中之痛苦可知。乃論者不察，借　備賢者之名，過事吹求，夫豈知人論世所宜。况明末諸將，擁兵跋扈。及八旗入關，則望風披銀　，百萬之兵，曾不能守尺寸土。不此之　。而以亡國之罪之，貴之梅村，收齋之流，可乎。其言可謂沈痛之至。時在座諸人，均爲之點然。但先生之在吳幕，不受一官。小　一職，會謂事成亦當白衣還山。律已嚴而責人薄，如先生者　有幾人。嗚呼，此可爲知者道，難與俗人言也。</p>
<p>先生長江萬里樓詩詞鈔編定於乙丑之夏，凡存詩一千四百五十二首，詞二百二十三　，丙寅冬又補詩一百五十三首。或雄渾壯闊，或淸微淡遠，或高曠流麗，或旖旎風流。黃鍾大呂，冷豔　香，各極其致，視題而稱。而我允愛其七古，如長平公主曲，火山曲·（兩詩均長二千餘言），金谷園曲，檀靑引，（兩詩均長予餘言），諸篇，無不波瀾壯闊，氣象萬千。（以詞長不備錄），以龍門之史筆，太白之仙才，少陵之學力，溫李之藻監，合冶一爈，自成一家。當使白傳梅村一齊拜到。豈咿唔咭嗶之士所　望其項背哉。乃或者以爲先生之詩，不脫樊（樊山）易（實甫）窠白，比之二陳（石遣散原）有雅鄭之別。眞可謂不知詩者矢。</p>
<p>詩自漢魏以至盛唐，若黃河之奔流到海，不可復回。故宋人以詞，元人以曲，各擅千秋。明人學唐，遺神取貌，已有鸚鵡之　。梅村生丁亂世，抱亡國之痛。故其爲詩，於驚才絕豔之中，付沉　蒼凉之致。漁洋以後，此風遂替，其能力自振作者，僅定　的已。先生之詩，絕似梅村，而不自立宗派。於當代之江西詩派，絕少褒貶。嘗請「宗派之說，各近其性，豈可懸鵠而射。以之自律則可，以之論人則不可」。故石遣散原時有往還，與予諭詩，尤爲相得。予謂文至桐城，詩至江西，詞至二窗，可謂已走至絕路。窮則變，變則通。胡適之，郭沫若所創新體詩，雖尙未成功。而詩之不能不變，則爲有識者所公認。先生以爲然。即石這先生在日，亦當親語予目：「子之詩近於唐音，不必學宋」。名華氣度，畢竟不凡，每念兩先生之言，不禁感慨係之。</p>
<p>先生之詞，小令如花問，慢詞如北宋，於南唐二主及泰七小晏爲尤近。其旨旨遠而微，其情深而文，其聲厲而哀。蕩氣廻腸，哀感頑艷，淸詞　句，自成馨逸。有淸一代，惟納蘭飲水，梁分彈指，足以當之。非竹垞樊榭輩所可及也。近人專工二窗，上　者猶八寳樓臺，拆下不成片段，况並此而不能耶？先生之詞，如貌姑仙子，超絕塵埃，均不食人間烟火語。當坐名花麗人讀之也。</p>
<p>先生清狂拔俗，絕艷驚才，酒後尊前，每多佳話。其與陳美　之艷史，尤膾炙人口·「一自新詩傳萬口，家家紅粉說楊圻。」固不在杜收之柳　卿下也。蓋美美，漢　名妓，越之苧羅村畔人。乙丑丙寅之際，吳將軍東山再起，先生隨節駐漢。上元之夕，張燈夜飲，同僚以先生新賦悼亡，抑鬱寡歡，乃召之來。美美悉眼識人，一見傾心，願以身事。先生亦引爲風塵知己，投贈之詩，不下百餘首。時軍書旁午，先生日草露布，夜宿銷金。其春夜宴諸將於小迷樓云：</p>
<p>南國佳人曳　裾，江關絲竹好春初。官軍夜報收京　，紅袖擎燈草捷書。</p>

<h3>祝福</h3>
<p>— 懷玉</p>
<p>在世亂年荒，紛爭不已的年頭裏我們偶然地相逢於這大都市的一角。由於情趣相同，以及朝夕共事的關係，我們之間逐漸地促認識，進步到彼此了解的程度。終於，隨着勝利消息的傳播，我們又各自東西了。生沽在一個變幻莫測的時代衷，真摯的友誼似乎還是一種彌足珍貴的十存在·但是，如今我却不能懷着無窮的悵惘來叙述當年的樂事了。也許我的悵惘是多餘的，那末，我願以萬分的皮　來祝福我們間友情的永生。</p>
<p>那大，在燈影搖紅·酒　　開之中，當我注視到你微笑的　容時，我不禁默默地爲你祝福上朋友，你是幸運的－雖然，我們是生活在被稱作一人民世　的今天，但是，在這古老的國度里，當自還被少數人藏諸金屋的時候，自出的結合始終是一件値得稱頌和羡慕的好事。我不十分淸楚你倆相愛的經過，然而我可以斷定這完全出於你倆自由的意旨，沒有一點世俗的成見和陳舊的觀念滲雜在內。可是在欣慰慶祝之餘，我却飽交到失侶的悲哀，許多人提醒我說－我們間的距離已無限的拉長了，又有人向我送來善意的詢間－今後你將爲寂寞（所苦吧？朋友，雖道這些全是事實嗎？我懷疑，但是我也迷惑，因此，我迫切地，期待着你的回音。</p>
<p>你還記得，正當戰爭意外地結束，我們從轟炸，死亡的威脅之下解脫出來之後，藉着偶然的機會，我們會於仲秋時節，結　同作武陵之遊；你還記得，在一個微雨初晴的早晨，我們會相偕泛舟湖上，在波光山影中暢話平生；你還記得，在那人聲嘈雜，熱悶非凡的旅舍裏，我們曾幷足聯床，拿無盡止的談話，排遣掉如許不眠的夜晚？你還記得，在無數次資主盡歡，觥籌交作中我們曾爲未來的日子舉杯互祝？你還記得，在耿耿的星河之下，我們也曾爲自己的前途立下不少的誓？如今，一切都隨着時間而消滅了，過去的情境將如柬流的逝水，一去不回，叫我怎能不平添無限的悵惘呢！若是有一天我舊地重臨，舉目河山，叫我又如何不油然而起故人之思呢？</p>
<p>雖然這採，我還是承認，兩性生活是世界上最幸福最美滿的生活，在可能範圍中，我們該盡力爭取它的實現。因爲，人類是向着不斷的提高和改善自己的生活而努力着的，在未來的新世界裏，一切由於環境不良而造成的種種變態心理，都將澈底的加以消滅。因此，我們可以這樣相信，結婚是人生關係的重大變化，如果說婚前的少女時代，是充滿了幻想和虛無氣味的年歲，那末婚後的共同生活將是更富於現實性的平凡的日子了。在這一點上，我們有着頗爲近似的不覊的性格，和荒誕離奇的設想，在我們的湝意識中，常常有着一些傳奇式的人物和事蹟出現，爲着滿足英雄主義的心理，我們又塑成了各自崇拜的對象。這些幼稚的觀念，雖非大病，究屬是一種可笑的錯誤。我想，在今後的日子裹，你一定會逐漸地放棄它們，毫無留戀，如同人們丟掉他昨日的舊鞋一樣。人是應該充滿着理想的，同時更應該追求他（或她）的理想，爲着實現自已的理想而不斷努力。但是，更重要的是，我們的理想必須生根在泥土裏，吸收陽光和水份，堅定地成長起來。不要把它幻作海市蜃樓，可以憑空捏造。我顯意依靠你的帮忙而改正自己，但不知道你是否還如往日一般的慷慨呢？</p>
<p>在好多地方，曾有人作着似是而非的預言－說「結婚是戀愛的墳華」，在我簡單的思維下，我終覺得充分虛妄，錯誤，我希望我的意見可以由你來加以證實。最近在一篇文章裏，讓到了一句與上述見解相反的話，他吿訴我們－「婚姻是命運的同舟」。我想這是較合情理的說法。在幸福的日子裏，「結婚」不再是「戀愛的墳墓」，而是「戀愛的發揚」，朋友，我願意你倆共同努力，藉着愛情的光，照亮一切生活在苦難中的人羣，鼓舞他們對人生的勇氣，對眞理的　往！</p>
<p>最後，我以萬分的虔誠爲你們祝福；我也以萬分的虔誠來祝福我們問友情的永生。</p>
<h3>荊棘</h3>
<p>— 施濟美</p>
<p>歡喜玫瑰的人憎護玫瑰樹上的荆棘，許是在採摘的時候曾經刺痛了他的手，否則，爲什麽要如此無聊的詛咒呢？難道他會不知道，玫瑰之所以美麗，就是因爲開在荆棘中嗎？</p>
<p>沒有荆棘，玫瑰的價値將要平庸了。誠然，玫瑰有美的嬌紅，芬芳的馥郁，可是，桃花化的顏色不也很美麼？桂花的香氣不還更濃？</p>
<p>從玫瑰我們想到人，我始終迷戀着那句話：「能够担當痛苦才是最美的人生。」最美的人生僅有在痛苦中可以看見，一切的富貴，榮華，過眼雲烟似的幸福與歡笑，均算不得最美的人生，萬萬算不得。</p>
<p>基督敎的偉大，並不在於今日全世界均有他的敎徒，以及敎堂之多，而在於當初的受難，那艱苦的被壓迫時期。革命並不因成功才光榮，光榮的却是志士仁人的流血和犧牲，孤兒寡婦的限淚哭聲，鐵索　　的獄中囚，永不歸來的戰地英魂……</p>
<p>我們並不提倡失敗論，然而却必須相信苦難是偉大的，有榮耀的。</p>
<p>就以最近最顯明的例子而言：梅蘭芳的崇高與光榮，決不是在今日上海最豪華美的戲院裏唱「費貞娥刺虎」，有成千萬的聽衆觀衆，曾受到過蔣主席的讚揚，中外人士的一致擁護，他的最値一提的美事，却是在抗戰八年中蓄鬚輟唱，將艱難的八載淸苦的度過。</p>
<p>荆棘是好的，它是生命的刺，也是生命的試金石，我們因此知道了好的與壞的，英雄和弱者，超人和平庸，我們辨別了美麗與醜惡。</p>
<h3>我們對於上海藝術協會的意見</h3>
<p>— 宋·溫肇桐·施翀鵬</p>
<p>誰也不能否認，而且不必否認，上海是中國新興藝術的策源地，過去國內所有的藝術運動，莫不以上海做出發點，然後波及到全國各地方去。</p>
<p>上海藝術園地所以會如此蓬勃，它的原因，實在繫於社會經濟的條件。國際資本家帶進來的西洋文化，西洋藝術，第一個港口是上海，因之，在上海便產生了新興藝術，把傳統的封建的　術消滅，替代或蛻變，這種影響，是搆成全國各地新興藝術發展的基礎條件，那是非常明顯的事實。</p>
<p>我們如果問想過去三十多年間的上海新典藝術現象，使我們不能忘懷的是，國內首創的最高藝術學府是創立在上海，著名的藝術社團——天馬曾，決瀾社，中華藝術敎育社……都誔生在上海，首次全國美展，全國兒童畫展也發動在上海，總之，上海不但是中國新興藝術的策源地，簡直是中國新典藝術的溫床。</p>
<p>八年抗戰之中，尤其是後四年，上海藝術界因爲客觀條件的限制，表現得非常一洛後，僅有少數的藝術作家舉行一些個人的作品展覽，除此以外，我們是不敢承認有什麼藝術運動。可是我們不可忽視的，忠貞的藝術工作者，堅決地苦守在上海，有的投奔到大後方去，參加實際的抗建工作。</p>
<p>一度冷落之後的上海藝術運動，跟着勝利的來臨又熱鬧起來了。螫伏已久的作家，跟內地回滬的許多藝術工作者，時常在計劃着如何恢復上海藝術運動的歷史光輝，而負有領導文化運動的當局，乘着這個時機，特地邀集在滬的藝術工作者，籌組上海藝術協會來推動上海的藝術運動。</p>
<p>我們以上海的藝術工作老的立爲，原則上是表示贊成幷寄予無限的希望，可是在技術上，不得不表示一些意見。</p>
<p>第一是藝協性質問題。上海藝術協會，應該是以推動上海至于全中國的藝術運動爲主旨。因之，它的性質，決不是畫家，音樂家，彫刻家·書法家，……的作家集團，應該包括藝術批評家，藝術敎育家，……以至於一切從事藝術活動的工作者共同來組織。</p>
<p>跟着第一個問題而來的，便是藝協約工作問題。藝協不但應該注意藝術作品的產生，發表，藝術作家生活的資助，附逆敗類的檢舉，我們認爲，對於中外古今藝術考察研究，藝術敎育的企劃推進，藝術著譯的編輯刋行，也都是不可放過的。</p>
<p>第三是藝協約動向問題。在全世界迷漫着民主思潮中產生的藝協，本身應該是非常民主的組織，藝術運動的對象，應該是人民大衆。因之，首先要從事普及藝術運動，同時還要提高藝術運動的本質，固不必完全放棄傳統的藝術形式，確應該把現實的內容配合進去，以接近大衆。也只有以大衆爲唯一的對象的藝術運動，才能够滲入大時代民主的洪琉之中，吾則僅是藝術工作者的形式主義的集團而已。</p>
<p>上海藝術協會初建的當兒，我們敢以芻蕘之見，貢獻給藝協不知社會人士對於我們所提出的這些意見，以爲怎樣？</p>
<h3>雙宿雙飛（二二）</h3>
<p>— 趙清閣</p>
<p>這一切，全荊州的人幾乎都知道。自然，特別是墨太太知道得最淸楚。事情的進行期間，墨太太一直參與着，甚而有若干她的意見在裏面。即僅七齡的麗雲，也看得胡明自白。但，只有一個人不知道。很雖說！也許這人心裏知道，佯裝不知道。這人把整個人生已經「霧」化了，他不需要明瞭許多，他需要一切蒙蔽他，他也蒙蔽自己。唯獨如此，這人才能恬靜地活着在烟火塵衰間。他懂得宇由上的事事物物都有醜惡面，就連自已，也不盡是美好的。</p>
<p>所以，他寗願用霧的眼光着一切；吾則，如果有一天他打開了霧幕看一切；他必爲醜惡呑食！因爲他佔計自己，已經無力戰勝醜惡了。</p>
<p>這人的哲學，是雜於人世出世之問，這人是聰明而幸福的，這人就是我們的翁老爺。</p>
<p>只有過一天早晨，翁老爺比平日醒的早了些時間。於是他睜開眼就要過癮，可是他發現烟具不在身邊，他喊了麗雲來問，麗雲天眞地吿訴他：</p>
<p>「王媽的房間裏，石老板正用着，我去拿來吧！」麗雲說罷，天眞地就預備去拿。</p>
<p>翁老爺一把拉住麗雲，苦笑地搖搖頭說：</p>
<p>「爸爸不用了，爸爸還要睡覺。好孩子，可千萬別去驚動媽。」</p>
<p>翁老爺果然打了個呵欠，就在這吁出輕微的薄薄一層噴霧裏，又沉沉入了夢。</p>
<p>這情形，麗雲覺得很滑稽，她好笑翁老爺這麽容易睡着。她當時雖然沒有把這件事去吿訴翁二太太，但却吿訴了麗華。不僅這件事，所有收羅在她的小眼裏的一切事，她都毫不遺漏地吿訴了　華。因爲麗華是她唯一的友人。而麗華又全吿訴了墨老爺，因爲墨老爺是麗華唯一的友人。</p>
<p>翁老爺可以置若罔聞，而墨老爺却不能！於是他有一天借着喝酒的題目的了翁老爺出來。到了一家小小的酒館裏。三杯下肚以後，墨老爺借着酒勁，打開這個悶葫蘆。他用很含蓄的口吻說：</p>
<p>「老弟，荆州市上現在傳說着一些對咱們旗人不恭敬的流言，說咱們開通；女子都不繼足；而且可以的了男子到飯館裏大吃大喝；還有什麼捧戲子子……等等。不知道您聽見過沒有？」</p>
<p>「啊？有這樣的事？翁老爺故作驚奇的神氣，但繼而，他又很快地說：「管他呢，橫豎他們講的是女子，不是咱們男子，因此，大哥倒不必去生閒氣。」</p>

<h3>Second Session of the Political Council: Minister of Economic Affairs Attends, Report Subjected to Numerous Written and Oral Questions</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 21st] The Political Council held its second general session at 8:40 AM today. 153 councilors were in attendance, along with Secretary-General Shao Lizi and Deputy Secretary-General Zhen. Jiang Yong presided as chairman, conducting the ceremony. The secretariat read the minutes of the first meeting and reported that Councilors Zhang Yusheng was unable to attend due to illness, and Lin Qingnian was unable to attend due to returning to Yingzhou (a place thought to be Japan) for personal matters. Councilors Situ Meitang was experiencing difficulties obtaining a seat on a ship, Gesang Zeren and Wang Weixin requested leave due to illness, and their attendance was deferred. Afterward, Minister of Economic Affairs Weng Wenhao attended and reported on the work of the Ministry of Economic Affairs. He briefly stated: Since the surrender of Japan in August of last year, the war has ended, but our country's economy is even more difficult than during the war. The organization and promotion of [the economy] is also proving difficult. The government has been earnestly handling various aspects to reduce difficulties and increase production. These emergency measures can be roughly divided into six types: (1) Increasing coastal water transport capacity, (2) Developing sources of coal supply, (3) Adjusting electricity supply, (4) Urging specialized management institutions to be responsible for resuming work, (5) Finding ways to supply necessary materials, (6) Regulating the market and balancing prices. To further improve the economic situation and prepare for the gradual start of construction, the following are currently being undertaken: (1) Revising domestic industrial and mining construction plans, (2) Drafting methods for importing industrial and mining equipment from Japan, (3) Improving our country's enterprise organization, (4) Negotiating long-term repayment methods for friendly nations assisting in construction, (5) Promoting export trade.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] After Minister of Economic Affairs Weng Wenhao's report, Councilors Rao Fenghuang, Zhang Ji, Yu Nanqiu, Wu Yunchu, and others submitted 53 written inquiries. Councilors Su Yao, Zhu Qing, and others submitted 13 oral inquiries.</p>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 21st] Minister of Economic Affairs Weng Wenhao stated in his report to the National Political Council today that he wished to resign from his position. After Weng's report was completed, it was met with criticism, especially regarding the occupying officials who were accused of embezzling huge amounts of enemy materials to fill their own pockets. Councilors strongly condemned such corrupt acts and demanded that Weng provide a detailed report on the enemy materials received, specifying the quantities and asking what measures had been taken to prevent unemployment, and whether he was aware of the "oiling" [embezzlement] by Economic Ministry officials.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 21st] The Executive Yuan hosted a tea party for the councilors at the Victory Building at 4 PM today. Over 160 people attended, including Councilors Dian Yong. Song Ziwen, Weng Wenhao, and Jiang Menglin personally hosted. Wang Shijie, Zhu Jiahua, Yu Feipeng, Zhang Wansheng, and others were also in attendance. Premier Song delivered a short speech, expressing his hope that the Executive Yuan's implementation would benefit from the guidance of the councilors, and raised his teacup to wish everyone good health. Subsequently, Chu Fucheng spoke, stating that prices were soaring everywhere and hoped that the government would pay attention to improving the people's lives. For the people returning to the capital, the problems of food, clothing, housing, and transportation should be resolved. If the people's livelihood problems can be solved, then there will be a solution to politics. Jiang Yong, representing the entire body, expressed gratitude to Premier Song.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 21st] At the first meeting of the Fourth National Political Council's Second Session, a telegram of respect to Chairman Chiang was approved by the entire body.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Special Dispatch from Chongqing, 21st] Tidbits from the National Political Council: (1) The weather has turned cool in recent days, and some of those attending the conference are wearing overcoats, covering their badges, which is causing headaches for the security personnel. (2) After Minister Weng's report, he occupied the row of heads of ministries and commissions alone, appearing quite lonely. (3) Political reports will be given tomorrow morning. A tea party hosted by the Executive Yuan this afternoon at 3 PM, some people say this is an administrative design. (4) The meeting times over the past two days have not been very precise. The opening ceremony was at 9:27 AM, the first general session was at 3:15 PM, and the third general session was at 8:30 AM. Some hope that the councilors will be more spirited. (5) Inquiries on the economic report and transportation are more written than oral, people say that this is a tactic, an advance of silent artillery fire.</p>
<h3>Military Aircraft Leaving Qingdao for Shanghai Crashes in Nanjing, Burning to the Ground; Passengers Include Two Guards of Director Dai</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] A military aircraft of the Aviation Commission took off from Qingdao on the 17th, carrying over 20 people. Unexpectedly, it encountered adverse weather conditions en route and crashed. According to investigation results: the aircraft crashed near Ming Xiaoling in Nanjing, and the fuselage was completely burned, leaving only wreckage. The pilot and passengers were burned to death, their flesh was unrecognizable, making identification very difficult, but inside the remains, the tags of two guards belonging to Director Dai Li of the Military Committee's Investigation and Statistics Bureau were found, along with a badge belonging to Xuan Fang, Section Chief of the Bureau's Personnel Section. After the aircraft went missing, the Aviation Commission and our Air Force authorities immediately dispatched two dedicated aircraft to search for the aircraft in the Qingdao, Nanjing, and Shanghai areas, and later dispatched eight more dedicated aircraft to participate in the investigation. After receiving a telegram from Nanjing, the cadres of the Investigation and Statistics Bureau here went to Nanjing yesterday afternoon to investigate. It is reported that after the aircraft took off on the 17th, it sent two telegrams stating that the weather was exceptionally bad along the way, and then all news ceased. It is understood that the aircraft was originally planning to stop briefly in Nanjing before flying to Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Passenger List of China National Aviation Corporation Missing Aircraft Fully Ascertained; Bei Songsun Changed to Another Flight Before Departure, Escaping Disaster</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The China National Aviation Corporation flew seven aircraft to Beijing and Shanghai on the 19th. Among them, aircraft No. 139, after refueling with 450 gallons of gasoline, took off from Yudu at 7:00 AM on the same day. At that time, as usual, it contacted the company by radio and there was nothing unusual at first. At 8:00 AM, radio contact was suddenly interrupted, and after that the news became unclear. Yesterday, an employee of the company told reporters: After the company learned that the aircraft was missing, it ordered the Shanghai, Beijing, and Hankou branches to send aircraft to search separately; at the same time, it also asked the Military Committee's Aviation Commission and the US Air Force to assist in the search, but its whereabouts are still unknown. According to the employee's personal speculation, judging by the time the radio contact was interrupted, the location of the missing aircraft may be on the border of Sichuan and Hubei or Sichuan and Hunan, but the company's aircraft have never had an accident before, so it is expected that the cause of the accident will be roughly: (1) Mechanical failure, this point is said to be less likely, because the company's aircraft are strictly inspected before takeoff, and the pilots are all experienced Chinese and American pilots. (2) Adverse weather, this is quite possible, because the border of Sichuan and Hubei is mountainous, so flying must be high, or the wings may be damaged by ice. (3) The radio antenna may be broken, which may also cause the communication to be interrupted, so even if the aircraft is forced to land somewhere, it is impossible to know for the time being. (4) Strong winds are also enough to make the aircraft lose its direction. However, it is said that missing does not necessarily mean an accident, it may be forced to land. The total number of passengers on the aircraft is 30, including Tao Qiliang, Deputy Manager of the Shanghai Branch of the Bank of China, Dong Xiaoyi, Deputy Manager of the Savings Department, Pan Xiaoman, Director of the Relief Department of the Executive Yuan's Relief Administration, and his wife, children, a family of six, and two employees of the Department. The full list is as follows: Passengers coming to Shanghai include Zhang Gongliang, Zhang Gongxin, Dong Xiaoyi, Liang Sena, Tao Qiliang, Hu Zhigang, Wang Jiang Jingwan, and one child, Wang Zaiping, Wang Cishen, Wang Ciping, Yao Mingchu, Zhang Guanying, Chen Xinian and other fourteen people; passengers going to Beijing include Zong, Xie Hua, Zhang Wen, Zhang Lun, Qu Didi, Qu Jingqin, Rao Yajun, Pan Xiaoman, Zhou Ming, and two children, Pan Cheng, Pan Yuzhuang, Chen Xiuchan, Hu Fanhou, and one child, and other sixteen people. There are eight children in total. Bei Songsun, President of the Central Bank, also took a flight to Shanghai on the same day. He had already boarded the aircraft, but he got off the aircraft and changed to another flight because he thought the seat was not very comfortable, so he escaped the disaster, which can be said to be blessed by heaven.</p>
<h3>Guangzhou Female Spy: An Italian Miss Can Speak Chinese, English, and Japanese</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Guangzhou Dispatch, 21st] A female spy case related to Simon (see our newspaper's telegram yesterday) also occurred here. The female spy is an extremely beautiful Italian girl named Banca, only 25 years old, who can speak Chinese, English, and Japanese. In 1943, she lived with Saito, a Japanese important figure, and Lieutenant Colonel Kotani, director of the Japanese Navy Special Service in Shanghai, and had close relations with Major General Yazaki, the head of the South China Special Service Agency, and also lived with Japanese people such as Takahashi Daiko. The headquarters has collected considerable evidence. She has been detained for four days. Recently, she was allowed to stay in Boji Hospital for medical treatment due to illness. The reporter met her in ward 208 of the hospital. Although her face was sick, she still could not hide her beauty. It is said that she is Chinese, not a spy. In 1935, she married Tan Zhanchao, a Chinese in Italy, and had five children. Later, she lived in Shanghai with her husband, but soon divorced. In 1942, she lived in Hong Kong and had a very hard life. Later, she went to Guangzhou and met Simon, and her life was entirely supported by Simon. Tang Yangguang, director of the War Criminals Investigation Team of the headquarters, conducted an informal interrogation yesterday on the 19th. When asked why she could often take Japanese military aircraft and ships between Shanghai and Guangzhou Bay during the occupied period if she was not a spy, she was speechless and cried incessantly. Finally, she signed a confession, admitting that her family was purely supported by Simon during the war. Later, the reporter re-investigated that the so-called Chinese husband of hers, Tan, is a lieutenant colonel and battalion commander of a search battalion of a certain army, and is currently staying in Yunnan. However, according to Colonel Tan, as far as he knows, Bei may not be a spy, because when Bei was in Shanghai, the Japanese thought she was a spy from Chongqing and was detained four times, and Bei Anka's name is also on the blacklist of the Japanese Special Service Agency. This time, she was arrested because she was implicated in the Simon case. The current camp is collecting relevant information for research, and it is said that it will be formally tried by the court in the near future.</p>
<h3>Northern Vietnam Not Yet Stable, We Will Temporarily Leave Four Divisions</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Kunming Dispatch, 21st] The situation in northern Vietnam has not yet stabilized. All our institutions in northern Vietnam have been centralized to allow our army to protect them. The 60th Army and the 93rd Army stationed in northern Vietnam will be transferred to Shanghai and Qingdao, and are currently waiting for ships to transport them. After the two armies leave Vietnam, our army will still leave four divisions in northern Vietnam temporarily, and will withdraw only after the order in the area has stabilized.</p>
<h3>Mei Siping and Others Will Be Transferred to Suzhou; 70 Major Traitors Will Be Transferred to the Hebei High Court</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Urgent Telegram from Nanjing, 21st] Mei Siping, Li Shengwu, Zhou Xuechang, Cen Deguang, Hu Yukun, Li Ouyi, Zheng Dazhang, Ling Xiao, Pu Tong, Guo Xiufeng and other rebels who were arrested in Beijing on September 26 last year, and Lin Baisheng, Chen Junhui, He Bingxian, Zhou Longxiang, Mo Guokang and other rebels who were released from Japan to Beijing on October 3 last year, will be transferred to the Suzhou High Court for trial in batches. The relevant departments have prepared the escort procedures, and several special numbers in the Suzhou prison have been cleaned and arranged, waiting for the vacancy. However, it is not yet possible to find out when the escort will be dispatched. Well-informed sources say that Lin Baisheng, Li Shengwu, Mei Siping and others have been prepared to spend the summer in Suzhou after they were told that Chen Gongbo and others were transferred to Suzhou. Recently, the bedding and undershirts of the rebels have been washed and renewed, as if they are prepared to go to "heaven".</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Dispatch from Beiping, 21st] The authorities in charge of arresting traitors will recently transfer 70 major traitors to the Hebei High Court for trial. The Hebei High Court has prepared houses and issued audience certificates.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Dispatch from Beiping, 21st] According to a certain source here, Su Tiren, who once served as the pseudo-Governor of Shanxi Province and the Director of the General Affairs Office of the pseudo-North China Political Affairs Commission, has fled from the custody of the Shanxi authorities for fear of punishment, but the truth remains to be verified. According to reports, after Japan surrendered, Su Lian returned to Taiyuan from Beiping. At the end of last year, the central authority in charge of arresting traitors sent personnel to Taiyuan, and the Shanxi authorities complied with the order to take Su into custody. However, not long after, representatives from various counties and groups in Shanxi wrote to the central government, requesting the release of Su and requesting that the Shanxi authorities not remove the Su Tiren Memorial Stele from the Haizi Bian Park.

<p>[Our Newspaper's Nanjing Dispatch, 21st] Zuo Shi, the head of the Siamese visiting delegation, met with our reporter today. According to reports, the China-Siam Friendship Treaty will be approved as soon as February.

Now China and Britain have signed a treaty, in which the British government will resell the balance of the Siamese rice it purchased to China. At present, Siam not only hopes to obtain economic cooperation and eternal friendship between China and Siam in terms of commerce, but also hopes to communicate the culture between China and Siam and deepen the friendship between the people of the two countries.</p>

<h3>52nd Army Advances Towards Fushun; We Consolidate the Outer Perimeter of Shenyang; Prices Decline, but Telecommunications Are Still Occasionally Disrupted</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Dispatch from Beiping, 21st] Zhao Gongwu's unit of the 52nd Army is advancing towards Fushun. Our army, which has entered Shenyang, is planning to consolidate the outer perimeter of Shenyang. Nearby counties can be gradually taken over in the near future. Du Yuming's treatment is progressing well and he is expected to be discharged from the hospital and move to another place for recuperation within the country.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Dispatch from Shenyang, 21st] After the Soviet troops withdrew from Sipingjie, Fushun, and Liaoyang, our large army is advancing in separate directions in order to quickly take over the defense. A new situation will be possible in the next few days. There are about 50,000 Communist troops in Fushun, personally commanded by Lin Biao. There are also many people in Sipingjie and Liaoyang. The Shenyang National Army's defense area has expanded. Grain prices have been falling since the 19th, and red gold has fallen sharply, falling by more than 3,000 yuan in two days. The reason is that the Soviet army purchased a lot of it in the past. It is also said that Shenyang has become the military and political center of the Northeast. People coming from the Beining Road north have arrived one after another, competing to sell gold. The prices on the 19th are as follows: 16,000 yuan per tael of red gold, 1,500 yuan per catty of silver, 20 yuan per catty of rice, 22 yuan per catty of flour, 6 yuan per catty of sorghum rice, 38 yuan per catty of pork. Legal currency is converted into circulation coupons at a black market rate of 14 yuan to one.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Dispatch from Shenyang, 21st] Telephone and wired telegraph communication in Shenyang were blocked and not connected from 3:30 PM on the 18th because it passes through the Communist area in Gongzhuling and other places along the way. It was only connected briefly on the afternoon of the 19th, and then it was blocked again. It is said that the telecommunications equipment in Sipingjie has been destroyed by the Communist army. After the Soviet army withdrew from Sipingjie, Liu Handong, Chairman of Liaobei Province, left with his entourage on the 18th and may go again in the near future. Currently, there are only two hours of radio communication between Shenyang and Changchun every day.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Chongqing, 21st] Liu, Deputy Minister of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said at a press conference yesterday that the Chinese government has not yet received a formal notification from the Soviet Union regarding the partial withdrawal of Soviet troops from the Northeast or the final withdrawal date.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Shenyang, 21st] Although the Soviet army withdrew from Shenyang last week, the Soviet Union is still secretly manipulating the economic lifeline of this former industrial city from Russia's hands. Most of the factories and exquisite residences in the city are hung with the Soviet flag, indicating that they are Soviet property and Chinese people are not allowed to touch them. Dong Wenqi, the mayor of Shenyang, has been discussing this matter with the staff of the Soviet consulate for days. The Chinese side believes that the Soviet side's purchase of these properties from the Japanese with military tickets during the occupation period violates the spirit of the Sino-Soviet understanding at the end of the war. According to reliable sources, 70 Soviet troops are still stationed in Shenyang to guard the factories purchased by the Soviet Union. It is also reported that 200 Soviet soldiers in plain clothes are still staying in Fanyang.</p>
<h3>The Soviet Side Still Says It Is Impossible to Transport National Army Troops on the Shenyang-Changchun Road, Using Various Excuses</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Urgent Telegram from Changchun, 21st] It can be inferred from the words of both parties in the meeting between Dong Yanping and Troshenko today that Marshal Malinovsky's headquarters will not withdraw from Changchun for at least the next week, even though the Soviet army is withdrawing rapidly.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Dispatch from Changchun, 21st] Our military delegation formally notified the Soviet side yesterday that it was preparing to use the Shenyang-Changchun Railway to transport troops from Shenyang to the north to take over the defense. The Soviet side immediately replied, expressing its agreement in principle, but said that the plague was prevalent in Beiping and vehicles could not pass through. In addition, it blamed the National Army for the destruction of the Hunhe Railway Bridge, saying that the destruction of the bridge prevented the coal from Fushun from being transported in. It also claimed that the staff of the Changchun Railway had been abused by our side, and that twelve locomotives had been detained by our side. It is impossible to use the road to transport Chinese troops before these situations are eliminated. According to reports, the issue of using the Central-Changchun Railway to transport the National Army to take over the defense has been mentioned repeatedly in the past Dong Yanping-Troshenko meetings, and a formal agreement was reached before February 1. At that time, the Soviet side did not have any objections, and the Changchun Railway Council once ordered the railway bureau to fully assist. The notification submitted by our military vehicle representative yesterday was a notification in nature and did not require a reply from the Soviet side.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] After the railway traffic south of Changchun was disrupted, the prices here seemed to be increasing day by day. Taking the end of December as the benchmark, the price index reached a maximum of 450 and a minimum of more than 120 as of March 20. The average index was 250, which was one and a half times higher than the previous year.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Dispatch from Changchun, 20th] It has now been proven that Liu Handong, Chairman of the Liaobei Provincial Government, and his staff are still living in Sipingjie, but they have lost their freedom. The previous rumor that they had broken out was not accurate. This mystery was first revealed by Dong Yanping, the head of the delegation. At 10:00 AM this morning, Dong suddenly received a phone call from Sipingjie. The caller was Xu, the Secretary-General of the Liaobei Provincial Government. Dong was overjoyed when he first received the call, but after talking for a while, he realized that the other party was deeply trapped in a tiger's den. First, Xu said on the phone: The war has ended and all the provincial government personnel are safe. Dong immediately said: Where are you calling from? It is said: I am in the telephone bureau. Dong asked first: How are you exactly? Xu paused and replied: I can't tell you now, you can understand if I don't tell you. Xu also said: She started calling Changchun from last night, but she didn't get through until this morning. In addition to the above words, Xu did not say anything else.</p>

She once recognized the female spy Kawashima Yoshiko as her adopted mother, and relying on her power, she founded Xinguang and Women's Magazine and Yuqing Women's Vocational School in Beiping to carry out cultural propaganda for the enemy and carry out slavish education. She worked very hard and was truly the number one female traitor in Beiping. It is also said that when Yin was running Yuqing Women's Vocational School, she constantly used drugs to intoxicate the female students and "gave gifts" to the Japanese army.</p>
<h3>Destruction of Railroad Systems in North China: Repairable Within Three Months; Ping-Sui Railway to be Completed in Three Weeks</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Chongqing Office, 21st] After our nation endured eight years of war damage, the entire country has yet to return to its former state. According to transportation sector figures, a total of 600 kilometers of steel rails and 1.2 million railway sleepers were lost.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>New Actions and Heightened Vigilance</h3>
<p>This newspaper has previously commented on the convocation of the Second Plenary Session of the Kuomintang, stating: "The Three Principles of the People are the supreme guiding principles for national construction and are originally accepted by all parties and factions. Therefore, how to implement the Three Principles of the People and the Five-Power Constitution should not be a problem; however, the agreements reached at this Political Consultative Conference (PCC) violate the spirit of the Three Principles of the People and the Five-Power Constitution, such as those concerning the Five Yuan system and the status of provinces. The Five-Power Constitution is a great legacy given to the Chinese people by the Founding Father of the Republic. Its provisions are meticulous, and its purpose is to remedy the defects of Western parliamentary politics and establish a sound political system for the Three Principles of the People, which must not be misunderstood or misinterpreted. The agreements made by this PCC on the draft constitution will dismember and dissect the political system that the Three Principles of the People seek to establish. If implemented, they will render the efforts of the Kuomintang over the past fifty years futile. This crisis is far greater than Yuan Shikai's conspiracies in the early years of the Republic... After a long period of war, the Chinese people urgently desire a stable order to have the opportunity to recuperate and thrive. We hope that the members of the Kuomintang Central Committee gathered in the temporary capital will be able to preserve the spirit of the Three Principles of the People while accepting the achievements of the PCC." Subsequently, the Second Plenary Session concluded successfully, and a declaration was issued, stating: "1. We have conducted a detailed and solemn review of the various agreements of the Political Consultative Conference. Recognizing the necessity of domestic peace, stability, and sincere unity, as well as the need to alleviate the suffering of our compatriots and stabilize the foundation of the nation, we are willing to cooperate with all parties and social figures with the greatest sincerity to promote their implementation. However, what we must insist on is that the revisions to the draft constitution must conform to the teachings of the Five-Power Constitution. This is because the Three Principles of the People and the Five-Power Constitution are inseparable. Abandoning the Five-Power Constitution would make it impossible to fully implement the Three Principles of the People. Therefore, our party must adhere to and maintain the Five-Power Constitution without wavering, which is truly for the long-term interests of the country. We hope that all parties and social figures will understand our position and understand our proposals."</p>
<p>This newspaper's above-mentioned commentary is entirely based on the standpoint of the people and does not harbor any special fondness for the Kuomintang. This is based on the following reasons: (1) The fact that the Three Principles of the People are followed by all parties and factions has transformed it from the private property of the Kuomintang to the public property of the entire nation. Therefore, this newspaper should uphold the spirit of the Three Principles of the People and call for its preservation. (2) China's national liberation movement is deeply historically linked to the Kuomintang, and the Kuomintang bears the heavy responsibility of defending the Three Principles of the People. Therefore, we must provide our views for consideration when the Second Plenary Session is convened. (3) After a long period of war, the Chinese people need stability. Only under the political system of the universally recognized Three Principles of the People can political disputes be avoided. Therefore, we must express this sentiment. We are gratified to see the declaration of the Second Plenary Session, because it conforms to our expectations for the Second Plenary Session regarding the PCC and the Five-Power Constitution: "Preserving the spirit of the Three Principles of the People while accepting the achievements of the PCC." However, just as we were feeling slightly relieved, we saw the criticism of Zhou Enlai, a representative of the Chinese Communist Party, who said that the resolutions of the Second Plenary Session shook the agreements of the PCC. It seems that his intention is to shift the responsibility for destroying the PCC agreements to the Kuomintang, believing that the Kuomintang's Second Plenary Session destroyed the agreements of the PCC and that it is deliberately undermining the achievements of the PCC, which is very obvious.</p>
<p>As soon as Zhou's statement was issued, it was immediately corrected by Wu Guozhen, Minister of Propaganda, and Wu Tiecheng, Secretary-General of the Central Committee of the Kuomintang. We do not want to comment further on this, but there are a few points that must be pointed out:</p>
<p>(1) The Kuomintang has the responsibility to defend the Three Principles of the People. Returning power to the people and implementing constitutional government is the Kuomintang's consistent aspiration; however, when returning power to the people and implementing constitutional government, if there are misunderstandings or misinterpretations of the Three Principles of the People, the Kuomintang naturally has the right to point them out or correct them. The Kuomintang is willing to sincerely accept the achievements of this PCC, as evidenced by the declaration of the plenary session, but it must correct any parts that misinterpret the Three Principles of the People;</p>
<p>(2) The focus of the problem, if there is a problem, lies in the future constitution. The decision on the political system belongs to the Constitutional Assembly, which in China is the National Assembly that is about to be convened. Legally speaking, no draft constitution, no agreement on the draft constitution, can bind the power and responsibility of the National Assembly to formulate the constitution. Even without the Kuomintang's Second Plenary Session pointing it out, the agreements on the draft constitution formed by the PCC cannot be used as a final version. Zhou's statement that the resolutions of the Second Plenary Session shook the agreements of the PCC is clearly intended to restrict the power and responsibility of the National Assembly and to restrict the entire people from exercising their public will. The government and the Kuomintang have a moral responsibility to accept the achievements of the PCC; legally speaking, the National Assembly and the government produced by the National Assembly later have no obligation or responsibility to accept the achievements of the PCC, but that is another matter.</p>
<p>It is gratifying that all parties and factions can abandon their selfish views and reach agreements at the PCC. It is also unquestionable that the agreements reached must be implemented; this can be seen from the resolutions of the Kuomintang plenary session and the government's measures. Since the Three Principles of the People are recognized by all parties and factions, the responsibility of defending the Three Principles of the People from changing its nature falls on the Kuomintang, and it is within the Kuomintang's duty to take necessary measures for this. This time, the CCP launched a propaganda offensive, aiming to cover up the new actions that the CCP is about to take. As Secretary-General Wu Tiecheng said: "Every large-scale propaganda offensive by the CCP is closely followed by a new action. It is unpredictable what new actions will occur after today's CCP propaganda offensive. Try to pay attention to the development of the Northeast issue and the implementation of the unified compilation plan, and you may be able to observe its movements." We must raise the vigilance of the Chinese people against the CCP.</p>
<h3>Homma, the Butcher of the Nanjing Massacre, a Venomous Centipede of Bataan Island, Deserved to Die; MacArthur Approved Upholding the Original Sentence, Ordering General Styer to Carry Out the Execution by Firing Squad</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 21st] The Japanese government had already imposed the most severe punishment on Masaharu Homma on October 18th of last year, ordering the deprivation of all privileges of his rank as Lieutenant General of the Army and prohibiting him from wearing the Japanese military uniform. Therefore, Homma will wear civilian clothes when executed by the American military. Masaharu Homma was a Lieutenant General of the Japanese Army, who had studied in France in his early years. Like Teiichi Suzuki, he committed the double crime of invading China and invading the United States. When Japan began its invasion of China, Iwane Matsui was defeated in Shanghai, so he sent Homma to China. Attacking Nanjing was the beginning of his battles in China. It is said that his subordinates, from officers to soldiers, were all composed of intellectuals and students, but they were even more ruthless in massacring the people of Nanjing and its suburbs than those barbaric Japanese from Hokkaido. Homma's troops later attacked Wuhan in China and massacred the people along the Yangtze River. In 1939, he was appointed "Commander of the Tianjin Garrison," blockading the British Concession and forcibly seizing a large amount of silver stored by our side, and instigating vagrants and the Japanese army to cooperate, poisoning Tianjin and massacring the people. This was his "wonderful masterpiece," which we will never forget. When the Pacific War broke out, Homma, as Commander of the Japanese Army in Taiwan, was immediately ordered to attack the Philippines. MacArthur, caught off guard, abandoned the Philippine Islands. General Wainwright's troops on Bataan Island were also subjected to the fierce attacks of this "reckless playboy," Homma. After a month of fighting, General Wainwright was captured due to exhaustion of ammunition and lack of reinforcements, but Homma's troops also suffered heavy losses. Therefore, after occupying Bataan, Homma began to massacre American prisoners of war and local civilians in retaliation. The blood on Bataan Island almost stained the ground red. Homma became a venomous centipede on this island after the robbery. Later, Homma was demoted and sent back to Japan, serving in the reserves. When the horns of victory sounded, the Allied forces occupied the Japanese islands and arrested war criminals. Homma finally surrendered and became a prisoner. He will soon be shot.</p>

<h3>Measures for Handling Shares of Traitorous Enterprises Approved; Profits of Those Not Yet Judged to Be Sent to the Management Bureau for Seizure; Those Already Judged to Be Liquidated and Disposed of at Market Prices</h3>
<p>The Su, Zhejiang, and Anhui Enemy-Puppet Property Review Committee yesterday approved measures for handling shares of traitorous enterprises. The main points are: For the shares invested by traitors and collaborators who have been reported and arrested by competent government agencies, such as provincial and municipal governments and courts, and who have used aliases or the names of their family members, if it is proven that they belong to the traitors, the person in charge of the enterprise shall not arbitrarily transfer or transfer the unique shares of the traitors, and shall not engage in any behavior that infringes on the rights and interests of the traitor shareholders. If there are any profit distributions or refunds of capital, the enterprise shall immediately submit the portion due to the traitor shares to the Management Bureau for seizure. As for traitors who have been sentenced by the court and had their property confiscated, the Management Bureau shall order the person in charge of the enterprise to report the net value of the enterprise and the amount that should be obtained under the name of the traitor's shares. If the shares are in the form of a company, the Management Bureau shall dispose of the shares at market prices. If it is a partnership, it shall be regarded as a withdrawal from the partnership, and the net value shall be settled. If the traitor's shares account for more than half of the total shares of the enterprise, the Management Bureau may first take over the custody and may order it to suspend business and liquidate it according to legal procedures when necessary. In addition, the Review Committee approved the allocation of more than 440 million yuan for resettlement and compensation for returned Chinese laborers and their families, and the allocation of several million yuan for the resettlement of workers at 武田药厂.</p>
<h3>Amendments to Our New Company Law Will Not Affect American Businesses in China</h3>
<p>Letters from Presidents Song and Sun to Mr. Gold</p>
<p>[This Newspaper] According to Mr. Gold, the chief editor of the English-language Great American Evening Post, he received letters yesterday from Song Ziwen, the President of the Executive Yuan, and Sun Ke, the President of the Legislative Yuan, confirming that the Chinese Trade Act promulgated by the United States will continue to be in effect. The government's amendments to the new Company Law will also avoid discriminating against American companies in China. The letter from President Song, sent from Chongqing on the 19th, stated in part: "The government has implemented today to enable American companies under the Chinese Trade Act to continue to operate." The letter from President Sun, also sent from Chongqing on the same day, in addition to commenting on some recent editorials of the newspaper, stated: "During a meeting of the Supreme National Defense Council yesterday, in the absence of the chairman, Vice Chairman Yu addressed your concerns about the provisions of the new Company Law affecting American companies under the Chinese Trade Act, which were finally dispelled. Remedial amendments have been established. Once the Legislative Yuan completes the legislative procedures for the final amendments, they will be promulgated by the government." Presidents Song and Sun often hope that foreign nationals will understand that China is very welcome to foreign nationals to participate in national construction. At the same time, it is also hoped that the United States will understand that China has no intention of discriminating against American companies in China. According to the original provisions of the draft new Company Law, it was stipulated that foreign companies operating in China must also operate in their home country. The Chinese Trade Act promulgated by the United States clearly stipulates that American companies established in China under the Act shall not operate in the United States. Therefore, if the original draft of the new Company Law is implemented, in addition to the existence and operation of American companies operating in China under the Chinese Trade Act being illegal, other companies that have been registered in the United States will also be affected. Many companies registered in Delaware, USA, are only for the convenience of operating in China and have no intention of operating in the United States in the first place. Recently, although news about the modification of the new Company Law in Chongqing has been transmitted from time to time, most of the news is unclear or contradictory. Now, judging from the letters from Presidents Song and Sun, the truth can be greatly clarified.</p>

Four traitor cases were heard: (1) Huang Wenlong, a native of Shanghai, served as a foreign affairs clerk and translator in the puppet Haimen County government in 1944.

<h3>This Month's Cost of Living Index Likely Higher Than Last Month, But Not By Much</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The cost of living index for this month, which is attracting attention from all sectors, will be officially released on April 1st. The Wage Review Committee of the Social Affairs Bureau had suggested to the city government that the cost of living index be published twice a month, but this was rejected due to the complicated compilation process. Yesterday, this reporter visited Mr. Cai Zhengya of the Research Office of the Municipal Government, who stated: "General commodity prices this month are higher than last month, and the cost of living index will inevitably increase. However, prices of necessities such as water, electricity, and rent have not increased due to strict government restrictions, and these items are essential for everyone, accounting for a large percentage of the cost of living index. Therefore, although commodity prices are higher this month than last month, the overall index should not be much different from last month."</p>
<h3>Reduced Public Sale of Flour, Mostly Due to Transportation</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] This reporter recently learned from the Shanghai Branch of the Executive Yuan's Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CRRRA) that with the exception of the first batch of flour sold at the fair price by CRRRA, which was milled and bagged in the United States and shipped to China, subsequent batches were all American wheat milled into flour by Chinese flour mills. However, some of these flour mills are located in Wuxi and other places, and sometimes the flour could not arrive in Shanghai on schedule due to transportation issues. Furthermore, there were also delays in the arrival of American wheat in China. For example, one batch that was originally scheduled to be shipped to China was suddenly rerouted to Europe, which affected the fair price sales in this area. Moreover, part of the flour stored in Shanghai had to be allocated to certain factories, so the amount available for general sale was inevitably reduced. However, Mr. Jiang Tingfu is currently attending a meeting at the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) General Assembly and should not disappoint China, which has the most severe and widespread disaster situation in this war. Furthermore, CRRRA Executive Director Liu Hongsheng has officially taken office, and all official business during Director Jiang's absence will be handled by Mr. Liu.</p>

<h3>Social Affairs Bureau Urges Workers Not to Summon Crowds, Only Send Representatives to the Bureau for Discussions</h3>
<p>Regarding the mediation of labor-management disputes, the responsible party of the Social Affairs Bureau made a statement yesterday, urging workers as follows: "When labor-management disputes arise, workers often fail to send representatives to the Bureau for mediation according to the law, and instead summon crowds to gather at the Bureau, which causes employers to fear being unreasonably surrounded and prevents them from attending mediation. As a result, time is wasted and disputes are provoked, harming the workers themselves. It is hoped that workers will understand this principle in the future. When disputes arise, they should only send representatives to the Bureau for discussions and must not summon crowds to gather at the Bureau. Otherwise, the workers themselves will be responsible for the delay if the employers do not attend the mediation due to fear of being surrounded."</p>
<h3>Large Batch of Locomotives Arrives</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] During the Anti-Japanese War, railways and highways in the occupied areas were destroyed, and the number of railway locomotives gradually decreased without replenishment. As a result, transportation has been greatly inconvenienced since the restoration. The Ministry of Transport is making efforts to rectify the situation and has ordered a large batch of locomotives from abroad. The first batch arrived a month ago. Now, the "Empire Viceroy" has brought fourteen locomotives and fourteen chassis from Khorrawshar, India. They arrived at around 8:00 AM yesterday and were unloaded at the Zhanghuabang Railway Pier.</p>
<h3>Free Medical Care and Medication for Rickshaw Pullers in This City</h3>
<p>Since the Social Affairs Bureau, in conjunction with relevant organizations and groups, established a property management committee for the Rickshaw Pullers Mutual Aid Association in this city, it has been actively rectifying the situation. It has also negotiated with the Shanghai Branch of the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration to allocate various medicines and dispatch several doctors and nurses. Starting from yesterday, free medical care and medication are provided at two clinics: No. 50 Hengqing Lane, South Huangpi Road (i.e., Avenue Saepey), from 8:30 AM to 11:00 AM daily, and No. 288 Zhun'an Road (MacKen Road), from 1:30 PM to 4:00 PM daily. Any rickshaw puller in this city and their family members who are ill can bring their license and go to the above locations for treatment.</p>
<h3>Municipal Government Civil Affairs Bureau Reports on Municipal Council Election Matters: Two Types of Elections - Regional and Group</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Zhang Xiaosong, Director of the Civil Affairs Bureau of the Municipal Government, Xiang Changquan, Deputy Director and Secretary-General of the Shanghai Provisional Municipal Council, Li Xuexun of the Civil Affairs Bureau, and Wang Jiashu, Director of the Second Department of the Social Affairs Bureau, met with reporters from this city in the conference room of the Municipal Government yesterday afternoon to report on the autonomy mechanism of this city and related election issues.</p>
<p>Election Methods</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council Election Congress is scheduled to open on April 28th at No. 110 Nanchang Road. The election of municipal councilors shall be conducted according to the laws promulgated by the National Government in January 1945, which shall be divided into two types: regional elections and vocational group elections. The former is the main method, accounting for 70% of the quota, while the latter is secondary, accounting for 30%. Regional elections adopt direct election, while vocational groups adopt indirect election. According to the population ratio of this city, the quota for regional representatives will be more than 120, and the quota for vocational group representatives will be about 50.</p>
<p>Regional Elections</p>
<p>The qualifications for regional electors are: Any citizen of the Republic of China who is 20 years old or older and has resided in the region for more than six months, or has resided in the region for more than one year, shall have the qualifications of a citizen and be eligible to vote. However, those who have been accused of being traitors or who have served as officials above the Jianren rank in the puppet government shall not participate. For election procedures, one polling station will be set up for every five Bao (neighborhood units). Voters shall go in person. The polling station will review their national identity card and issue a ballot for completion on the spot.</p>
<p>Group Elections</p>
<p>Vocational group elections are based on occupation. The existing units are divided into farmers, workers, businessmen, educators, fishermen's associations, and freelancers. The election is divided into two stages. In the primary election, each trade association selects three people. Freelancers include seven or eight categories, and each group selects three representatives with at least three years of membership qualifications, and then re-elects one person. However, due to the simple organization of the fishermen's association and the educators' association, direct voting is adopted. The qualifications for vocational national election are: (1) those who are currently engaged in the profession can participate, and (2) limited to one group.</p>
<p>Candidate Qualifications</p>
<p>Qualifications for candidates: Candidates must pass an examination or review of documents proving their qualifications. Examination methods include direct oral and written examinations. However, in order to facilitate citizens' participation in the election in Shanghai, the examination method will not be adopted and the documents will be reviewed. If the review is not passed, the election will be invalid even if elected. The review is handled by the committee organized by the municipal government.</p>
<p>Voting Method</p>
<p>In order to avoid manipulation by a few people during voting, each ballot can only select one person, and a secret ballot method is adopted. When counting the ballots, experts are invited to count the ballots publicly in a concentrated manner. The number of candidates is equal to the number of formal councilors. After the election results are compiled, they are submitted to the Minister of the Interior for approval. The elected persons have the right to participate in politics freely. If they do not want to be elected, they will be re-elected.</p>
<p>Registration Date</p>
<p>The preparatory period before the election shall be at least 40 days. The first ten days are the announcement period. Registration will begin on March 28th and end on April 13th. Those who wish to participate in the election must complete the registration procedures within this period. Those who do not participate in the registration after the deadline will not enjoy the right to vote or be elected.</p>
<p>Measures for Reorganizing Trade Associations</p>
<p>The Social Affairs Bureau stipulates adjustment measures for trade associations in various industries. (1) Restoration: Those who did not participate in the work of the puppet regime during the Anti-Japanese War or who were directors or supervisors under the puppet organization but had no other criminal acts shall be allowed to restore their original status. (2) Reorganization: Those who are legal but have unhealthy internal conditions will be reorganized by government-designated personnel. (3) Representatives elected by the same industry will initiate preparations for re-establishment. If it is found that the nature of each association is the same, it shall be unified into one group according to law. The adjustment will be completed in April. In addition, the area of ​​this city is currently divided into 32 districts, including the Zhenru district.</p>
<h3>Municipal Government Revenue and Expenditure for Last Month Deficit of 60 Million Yuan; Municipal Authorities Plan to Request Allocation</h3>
<p>The municipal finance of the Shanghai Municipal Government is very tight, and revenue is insufficient to cover expenditure. The expenditure of each department in February of this year is as follows: General Office of the Municipal Government, totaling 269,625,360.00 yuan. Civil Affairs Bureau, totaling 52,000,000.00 yuan. Accounting Office, totaling 52,962,970.00 yuan. Police Bureau, totaling 377,155,696.00 yuan. Finance Bureau, totaling 89,315,921.00 yuan. Education Bureau, totaling 198,422,893.00 yuan. Health Bureau, totaling 253,981,048.00 yuan. Public Utilities Bureau, totaling 117,684,695.00 yuan. Public Works Bureau, totaling 198,090,009.00 yuan. Social Affairs Bureau, totaling 23,733,690.00 yuan. Land Administration Bureau, totaling 67,286,520.00 yuan. Statistics Office, totaling 1,542,400.00 yuan. In addition, the expenses of the Garrison Headquarters Defense Committee and other institutions, as well as loan interest and other expenses, totaled 1,886,727,9113.26 yuan in national currency. However, the total revenue in February, including tax revenue, central government allocated tax revenue, and regulatory fee revenue, totaled 1,267,806,211.58 yuan in national currency. After offsetting revenue and expenditure in February, there was a deficit of 600 million yuan in national currency. It is reported that the municipal authorities plan to request an allocation to cover this deficit.</p>
<h3>Acquisition of Factories in Taiwan Province Urgently Requires Technical Personnel; Provincial Government Hopes for a Steady Stream of Personnel; Coal, Rice, and Sugar are All Under Government Control</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Bao Kehong, director of the Shanghai Liaison Office of the Taiwan Provincial Administrative Governor's Office, recently told reporters that the "Taipei" vessel was unable to complete unloading, and yesterday the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company dispatched the "Haiyu" and "Haizhou" vessels to Taiwan. Both of these vessels are Liberty ships, weighing 10,000 tons. The "Haizhou" carried many personnel from the Governor's Office and the Party Headquarters, who had been staying in Shanghai for a long time, some waiting for the vessel for several months. As for the goods transported to Taiwan, they will still be transported by the "Taipei" vessel, most of which are "CRRRA" relief supplies, such as flour. In addition, there are fertilizers, soybean cakes, and industrial and mining equipment purchased by the Governor's Office.</p>
<p>3,000 Tons of Sugar Shipped to Shanghai</p>
<p>The voyage from Shanghai to Taiwan takes about two days and nights and is very safe. The "Taipei" vessel, which arrived in Shanghai from Taiwan a few days ago, was originally the Japanese vessel "Daiyo Maru." This vessel carried a total of 3,000 tons of sugar, 600 tons of coal, tea, and some fruits. If the ship's equipment is perfect, a large amount of fruit can be sent to Shanghai. Taiwan produces watermelons in all four seasons, which are sweet, large, and comparable to those produced in Jiangsu and Zhejiang. In the future, they can also be supplied in a steady stream, delighting the people of Shanghai. Taiwan is hit by typhoons twice a year, making navigation in the Strait difficult. Therefore, it is feared that sailing ships will not be able to navigate at that time.</p>
<p>Limited Cabin Space Restricts Passengers</p>
<p>Some people who do not understand the truth have the misconception that Taiwan is too severely blockaded. In fact, it is all due to the lack of transportation. Taiwan is our country's territory, and any Chinese citizen can go there. The reason why passengers going to Taiwan must first be reviewed by the Governor's Office is because the cabin space is limited, and it is necessary to enable the receiving personnel to go there as soon as possible so that they can return to normal as soon as possible. Currently, the acquisition of factories in Taiwan Province is done by means of a "supervisory" method. All the original technicians are retained and continue to work as usual, and the Governor's Office only sends personnel to supervise to ensure that production does not stop. However, the Japanese residents remaining in Taiwan will all be sent back to Japan in the short term and replaced by Chinese personnel. Therefore, the Taiwan Provincial Governor's Office urgently hopes that technical personnel will be able to go there in a steady stream.</p>
<p>Tens of Thousands of Tons of Coal Waiting to be Shipped Out</p>
<p>Currently, the commodities under control are rice, sugar, and coal. Coal is controlled by the Fuel Management Committee, and there are currently 60,000 to 70,000 tons waiting to be shipped out in Keelung. Rice currently costs 20 Taiwan dollars per catty in Taiwan, which is equivalent to 60 yuan in legal tender, or 60,000 yuan per shi. Therefore, there is no possibility of exporting it. Taiwan's soil has not been fertilized for five years, and there has been almost no production this year. Shanghai has recently had expensive goods, and sugar prices are still cheap, which is due to the sugar from Taiwan coming to Shanghai. The Provincial Government hopes to exchange this remaining commodity for fertilizer, which Taiwan urgently needs.</p>
<p>As for remittances, the Governor's Office is currently temporarily setting the exchange rate at 30 yuan in legal tender for every Taiwan dollar, and is currently applying to the Ministry of Finance for approval.</p>
<h3>China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Plans to Allocate Sailing Vessels to Private Companies</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] During the war, private ships suffered extremely heavy losses. After the victory, various private shipping companies organized a Warship Loss Compensation Claims Committee, which elected representatives to go to Chongqing to request compensation from the government. Although the government accepted the principle, there has been no concrete solution to date. It is now learned that in order to temporarily subsidize private shipping, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company plans to take back the 50 "Feng" class sailing vessels that were taken over and leased out by the Nanjing Branch and hand them over to private companies for operation. The above plan will be realized at the beginning of next month. The remaining "Pu" class sailing vessels will also be taken back in succession.</p>
<h3>Pier "Shortage": Vessels Arriving in Shanghai Have Nowhere to Berth; Two Remedial Measures</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Recently, some vessels arriving in Shanghai have had no piers or buoys to berth, which has adversely affected the city's foreign trade. In order to understand the real situation, this reporter visited Mr. Liu Nianzhi, general manager of the China Wharf Co., Ltd. in this city, who said: "The number of piers and buoys in this city is not small, but the number that can actually be used is not large. The reasons are: (1) The draft of ships coming from overseas recently is generally around 20 feet, which is not sufficient for most piers in this city. (2) Dredging work on the Huangpu River has been suspended for eight years, so the river mud has accumulated to a high level, and dredging equipment and ships are currently extremely scarce. (3) Most of the wharf warehouses are filled with items from the Enemy and Puppet Property Disposal Bureau, so they must be used until the items are cleared. (4) Some wharves were either destroyed by soldiers or suffered excessive wear and tear due to the enemy and puppet regime occupying them for many years, and must be repaired before they can be used. According to statistics: At present, there are five state-owned wharves on both sides of the Huangpu River, ten Chinese-owned wharves, twelve originally owned by the enemy, thirteen owned by British merchants, and two owned by American merchants. Among them, the British merchants' wharves are in better condition, and the actual wharves that can be used are quite few, and most of them need to be repaired and renovated. Currently, the most wharves are used by the Allied forces and the ships of the "UNRRA". The buoys in the Huangpu River are also used by Allied naval vessels, so there are very few that can be used for commercial purposes. The only remedial measures currently are: (1) to speed up dredging work, and (2) to actively repair each wharf." He also said: "If Shanghai wants to become a major port for import and export trade, one or two bridges must be built between Pudong and Puxi. After completion, a large number of wharves in Pudong can be used, and the cost of transporting goods can also be reduced, which will greatly benefit the promotion of trade in this city."</p>
<h3>Foreign Vessels Sailing in the Yangtze River Must Fly the Chinese National Flag</h3>
<p>It is reported that the Jardine Matheson and Butterfield &amp; Swire companies have repeatedly attempted to use the pretext of transporting relief supplies from the Executive Yuan's Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CRRRA) to sail their Yangtze River vessels, such as "Kangding," "Wanliu," "Shashi," "Jihe," and "Xinchanghe". The CRRRA has found malpractices in British ships sailing along the coast, which has damaged navigation rights, and the aforementioned Yangtze River vessels are not within the scope of the lease, so they filed an objection. Although foreign merchants have repeatedly requested it, it has not been approved. It is now purely determined by the CRRRA that if foreign merchant vessels sail to the Yangtze River area, they must uniformly fly the Chinese national flag in order to agree. The Chinese shipping industry is gratified by this measure.</p>

<h3>After the Gold Standard Stabilized, Speculation Focused on Hong Kong Dollars, New Notes Rose Again by More Than Twenty Yuan</h3>
<p>The initial price of gold yesterday was stable, then turned weak. The Bank of China still allocated 1.6 million to Tongrong at 1,510,000, which was slightly higher than the market price, but the industry still found it difficult to accept. The upward trend was closed, and bullish traders, seeing no opportunity to profit in the short term, liquidated their holdings, resulting in a further drop of 20,000. The morning opening was stable, but the price of 1.6 million yuan failed to move. When the Bank of China allocated at 1,590,000, the allocation price was higher than the black market, and all registered parties withdrew. Around noon, the price was 1,580,000, and there were few active traders. Suppliers continued to liquidate their holdings, and in the afternoon, the price fell to around 1,560,000, with few transactions. The day's process was extremely unremarkable. Ornamented gold was listed at 171,000, sycee silver at 1,600, and silver dollars rose to around 1,000 yuan. The clandestine rate was average, and the interest rate was from one jiao eight fen to two jiao.</p>
<p>The U.S. dollar was stable, weak, and unchanged, consistently staying below the 2,000 yuan mark. Around noon, it was around 1,980 yuan, and in the afternoon, it declined slightly again, hovering around 1,960 yuan. The final closing price was 20 yuan lower than the previous day. The U.S. exchange rate did not change. Old Hong Kong dollar notes were slightly weaker, and the final closing price decreased by a small amount of five yuan. New notes, with active traders focusing on the approaching parity between old and new notes, saw increasing buying interest. At noon, notes from 1947 traded at a high price of 172 yuan and briefly fell by more than ten yuan, but were pulled up again in the afternoon, ending at the top of the range, rising by another twenty-seven or eight yuan compared to the previous day. Hong Kong Telecom shares were 450 yuan, and Robbie shares were 550 yuan, both seeing small declines.</p>
<h3>Government Bonds Still Difficult to Develop, Stock Market Fluctuated</h3>
<p>The rise and fall of government bonds were even narrower, and the market situation was deserted. As a result, the prices of various bonds continued to decline slightly. Yesterday, large Shanghai stocks were mediocre, while small stocks advanced. At one point, prices fell, with Wing On Textiles at 4,250 yuan, American Asiatic at 3,280 yuan, and King Fook at 260 yuan. Under the enthusiastic purchase of the Sichuan banking group, the afternoon closing recovered and rose again, with large stocks flat and small stocks rising by 20 to 45 yuan each. Many laggard stocks were pulled up. The early trading in the afternoon was firm, then weakened, with large stocks falling. Small stocks, such as King Fook, once traded as high as 300 yuan. The early trading of foreign stocks was firm, but Jardine Matheson was flat. Jardine Matheson's share price rose to over 9,000 yuan, but the operators closed positions. The securities group could not resist and retreated, falling slightly from the high. At noon closing, except for Wheelock Marden and Jardine Matheson, which had similar changes, the rest declined by a small half to one percent. The market situation was confusing.</p>
<h3>Sparse Transactions in Yarn and Cotton</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market declined again. The morning opening lacked the strength to rise. Although there were sporadic transactions by inland buyers, mills were very willing to sell. Therefore, the prices of various yarn counts declined by a small amount of 20,000 to 30,000. The transaction volume of 32-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn was 1.49 million, which was considered stable. However, at noon, the Shanghai Textile Construction Company listed a large supply of various yarn counts of 32-count and above. Considering the principle of supply and demand, the prospects for double-strand yarn are unlikely to improve.</p>
<p>Yesterday, New York cotton prices had mixed fortunes, with increases and decreases ranging from three to six pounds. The spot price for nearby contracts was $26.70, and the forward price was $26.66. The spot price for Middling was $27.25. The local spot cotton market was still firm, but transactions were increasingly scarce. The Shanghai Textile Construction Company continued to wait and see. Only the Shenxin Spinning Factory purchased 100 bales of Da Zhongji velvet cotton at a factory price of 102,000 yuan. In addition, fellow traders purchased Brazilian cotton at a price of 84,000 yuan and seed cotton at a price of 17,000 yuan. All the above prices are ex-warehouse prices.</p>
<h3>Reduced U.S. Cotton Production</h3>
<p>[United Press Washington, 21st] The U.S. Bureau of Statistics reported that U.S. cotton production in 1945 was 8,781,000 bales, compared to 11,800,500 bales in 1944 and 11,129,000 bales in 1943. This shows that 1945 was one of the years with the lowest cotton production in the U.S. in a century, with the exception of 1921, when production was only 7,978,000 bales.</p>
<h3>China Industrial Company Purchases American Textile Machinery</h3>
<p>Worth Millions of U.S. Dollars</p>
<p>[Central News Agency special dispatch from this city, 20th] It was announced here today that the China United Industrial Company has purchased American cotton textile mill equipment worth one million U.S. dollars, including 27,000 spindles and 500 looms. This will be shipped to the vicinity of Shanghai for installation in a large-scale industrial company. This is the first large-scale purchase of American textile equipment for domestic restoration and use by Chinese industrialists. The above equipment was originally owned by a manufacturing plant in Mississippi. Shipping will take four to five months. After the equipment is installed near Shanghai, it will employ 1,000 to 1,500 workers from Sichuan.</p>
<h3>Rice Prices Continue to Decline Slightly, Glutinous Rice Plummets by Six or Seven Thousand</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the rice market saw prices decline due to sunny weather and increased shipments from rivers. Japonica rice declined by 600-700 yuan to 1,000 yuan, while indica rice was scarce and prices were stable. White glutinous rice also turned sluggish, with some arrivals pushing prices down by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. High prices attracted distant buyers, suddenly creating a situation of oversupply and causing prices to plummet by 6,000 to 7,000 yuan. Flour exports were stagnant, and sales in Shantou were weak, with raw tung oil continuing to decline by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Refined tung oil and vegetable oil both saw declines of 1,000 to 2,000 yuan, while soybean oil saw little change and lacked both gains and losses. Soybean prices continued to decline by 600 to 700 yuan, and soybean cake also softened, declining by another 100 to 200 yuan. Wheat bran was mediocre, while raw peanuts remained firm. Sesame and corn prices remained relatively stable. Cottonseed cake, due to most machines switching to gasoline and diesel fuel, saw reduced demand and prices declined by 600 to 700 yuan.</p>
<h3>High-Quality Green Sugar Arrived Yesterday</h3>
<p>A Batch Opened by Xing Si Yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday, the guild tendered for sugar, with only medium granulated white sugar available, totaling over 2,600 bags at a price of 49,000 yuan. Traders bid 49,500 yuan, and sellers in the North bid 51,000 to 51,500 yuan. It is reported that a few hundred bags of high-quality green sugar from the supplier arrived yesterday and are being cleared through customs. The largest batch can be opened the day after tomorrow.</p>
<p>A batch of goods from Xinghua Siyuan Company opened yesterday. The goods were of higher quality, so the price was also good, with transactions at 84,000 yuan. Subsequent goods were reduced in price.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang and Shandong Salt Arrive in Shanghai Successively</h3>
<p>A Large Batch of Taiwanese Sugar Also Arrives</p>
<p>The Sanbei Company's Mingxing vessel returned to Shanghai from Wenzhou yesterday, carrying 1,680+ pieces of tea, 100 pieces of tea oil, 512 pieces of fresh eggs, 597 bags of sugar, 1,700 pieces of paper, 11,590+ pieces of wood, 1,200 pieces of charcoal, and 6,000 bags of salt. The China Merchants Bureau's Haizhe vessel also returned to Shanghai yesterday from Qinhuangdao via Qingdao, carrying 400 tons of coal from Qinhuangdao, 1,000 bags of coarse salt from Qingdao, 160 pieces of raw tung oil, and 540+ pieces of tobacco leaves. A large amount of sugar arrived in Shanghai. The China Merchants Bureau's Haiwan vessel arrived at the port from Keelung yesterday, carrying 21,930 bags of sugar and 800 boxes of oranges, and unloading began.</p>
<h3>Unstable Tea Market Base</h3>
<p>The tea market situation shows little improvement, as buying power is weak and many profit-takers frequently consider selling. Therefore, there is still much loosening, and the trend is toward a soft market due to oversupply. Moreover, shipments of Qimen tea and Hangzhou tea are continuously arriving in Shanghai, further weakening confidence and pushing prices down. Observing the current market situation, if sellers continue to loosen and dump, the foundation will be difficult to consolidate.</p>
<h3>Coal Market Weak, More Firewood and Charcoal Arriving</h3>
<p>The coal market continues to be weak, and even white coal briquettes are under pressure, fluctuating and declining. After this allocation, the sales of bituminous coal by factories will be difficult to improve in the short term, and market prices continue to decline slightly. Due to clear weather, the arrival of firewood and charcoal has gradually increased, and the market situation has slightly loosened.</p>
<h3>Metal Goods Flood In</h3>
<p>This month, large hardware and foreign goods have been arriving one after another, either directly from the United States or indirectly transshipped from Hong Kong. The former includes steel plates and strip steel. It is said that Fengshun and Kang, among others, have received no less than 200 to 300 tons of steel plates of various types. Strip steel is said to be sold out soon due to limited arrivals. The latter includes white lead wire and #10 drawing wire. This is the second batch of white lead wire to arrive, totaling hundreds of tons, mostly soft.</p>
<h3>Gasoline Freight Rates Reduced</h3>
<p>It is now known that freight rates for carrying gasoline, kerosene, etc. from the United States have been reduced. From San Francisco to Manila, the rate is US$9.80 per ton, to Hong Kong it is US$9.55, to Shanghai it is US$8.45, and to Dalian it is US$7.20. The further the distance, the lower the freight rate. Therefore, it is said that the selling price of gasoline and kerosene in Shanghai will be further reduced.</p>
<h3>India Plans to Establish 130 Textile Mills</h3>
<p>[Reuters New Delhi, 21st] Legislative Department sources say that the committee set up by the government to study the expansion of India's textile industry recently proposed the establishment of 130 new textile mills. The factory equipment will be imported from the United Kingdom and the United States. If it is imported from the United States, the government will provide exchange rate facilitation. The government has notified the British government of India's urgent need for textile machinery.</p>
<h3>Business Conditions Summary</h3>
<p>Cotton cloth trading is sparse, and traders are watching the market, with morale low and prices tending to decline further.</p>
<p>Artificial silk factory sales are greater than purchases, and prices are declining again. The silk market has mixed fortunes, with electric silk and foreign silk rising slightly by 1,000 yuan, while American Asiatic quilt covers are still sluggish in sales and have declined by another 10,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The vermilion soap allocated by the Enemy and Puppet Assets Management Bureau can be picked up today. Traders are rushing to sell, and various soaps have been dragged down, while matches have become firm again.</p>
<p>Cigarette sales are quite strong, and the market has fewer goods, so prices are rising again. Chinese factory cigarettes, such as Da Dong and Hua Cheng, are still being distributed, showing slight weakness.</p>
<p>Saccharin is rising again, while other Western medicines are stable as always.</p>
<p>Kerosene sales are sluggish, trending downward slightly, while crude oil is down nearly 200,000 yuan per ton due to the lack of purchasing by out-of-town buyers for a long time.</p>
<p>American Tree brand leather is slightly popular due to actual sales, and most other prices are stable, with few transactions.</p>
<p>Pig bristles are tight due to tight credit and limited exports due to ships, making it impossible for goods to flow smoothly. Merchants are watching, and the buying interest is very sluggish, with the market atmosphere weak and depressed, and prices declining again.</p>
<p>Yesterday's timber market trend was still depressed, with continuous supply and poor actual sales, causing all goods to be sluggish.</p>
<p>The industrial raw materials market is flat and weak. Caustic soda is slightly stabilized due to slight additional purchases by Hankou buyers.</p>
<h3>Prefabricated Houses, U.S. Restricts Exports, Canada Abolishes Control, 300 Types of Goods Opened Up</h3>

<h3>Municipal Middle School Teachers to Stage a Full-Scale Work-to-Rule! Due to Unsuccessful Attempts to Improve Treatment</h3>
<p>[Local News] Municipal middle school teachers previously sent representatives to the municipal authorities to request improved treatment, and the process has been fraught with difficulties. It is now known that the representatives, based on the will of all teachers, believe that the municipal government has not fully recognized the extent of the hardship faced by municipal school teachers and that a serious expression is necessary to arouse social sympathy. Yesterday, the delegation made a final request to the Education Bureau, but to no avail. Therefore, they unanimously decided to implement a full-scale work-to-rule from today and issued a declaration appealing to all sectors of society.</p>
<h3>Students from Sichuan Province at National Central University Request Postponement of Departure from Sichuan</h3>
<p>Resulting in Expulsion or Demerits</p>
<p>[Dahua News Agency Chongqing Airmail] Since the Ministry of Education announced the order of school relocation, with National Central University being the first, students at National Central University were overjoyed. However, a small number of students from Sichuan Province, limited by practical difficulties, jointly launched a campaign to postpone the move from Sichuan and made a number of welfare demands to the Restoration Committee. The committee believed that these demands mostly involved administrative issues of the Ministry of Education and the school, making it difficult to respond. This led to dissatisfaction among a small number of radical students who posted announcements attacking and scolding the committee. All members of the committee expressed regret and submitted their resignations to the school authorities. The authorities believed that this matter was related to the future of National Central University and convened the 118th school affairs administrative meeting. The meeting unanimously passed a resolution to expel one of the masterminds, give six accomplices two major demerits each, give twenty-three signatories one major demerit each, and reprimand seven blindly following students. Those with two major demerits will have their public funds or loans suspended for four months, and those with one major demerit will have their public funds or loans suspended for two months.</p>

<h3>Overview of Education in Anhui Province: 66% of Children Receive Education; No New Ordinary Middle Schools, More Vocational Schools</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Bengbu Special Dispatch] During the War of Resistance, the authorities in Anhui Province were able to coordinate educational measures with wartime needs. After the general situation of the war was determined, they devoted themselves to the restoration and expansion of national schools. As of the 34th academic year, children who had received and were receiving national education accounted for 66% of the total, and people who had received and were receiving mass education accounted for more than 55% of the total. Both have reached the standards stipulated in the central government's first five-year education plan.</p>
<p>Second Five-Year Education Plan Implemented in Order</p>
<p>The second five-year education plan is currently being implemented. In terms of secondary education, in order to coordinate with the first and second national education plans, normal schools have been expanded annually so that the teachers trained within five years will be sufficient to meet the demand. Ordinary middle schools have gradually increased in number along with the increasing number of primary school graduates and the increasing demand for talents in society. The authorities, in accordance with central regulations, will continue to adopt the principle of provincial high schools and county junior high schools in the future, so that human and material resources can be concentrated. Vocational education is divided into four types: industrial, agricultural, commercial, and medical. In view of the urgent need to develop construction work in the future, it is even more necessary to train technical talents. Ordinary middle schools will not be expanded, and more efforts will be devoted to the establishment of vocational schools so that they can meet the actual needs of society. In terms of higher education, Anhui University, the only university in Anhui Province at the beginning of the War of Resistance, was suspended. In response to actual needs, the Jiangsu-Anhui Political College was established. Later, with changing times and circumstances, it gradually transformed into today's Anhui College, both to help young people who had dropped out of school and to cultivate talents needed by society. In terms of social education, the provincial government, due to the difficulty of raising funds in recent years, has reduced the number of existing fixed and mobile social education institutions. It is now planned to establish fixed social education institutions in important areas, supplement their business funds, and establish mobile organizations to tour the counties.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Education Promulgates Three Regulations: Nationwide Implementation of Educational Broadcasting</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education is promoting educational broadcasting. During the war of resistance, three sets of regulations were formulated and issued to all provinces and cities in the free areas for implementation. After the victory, all recovered provinces and cities were also ordered to promote it uniformly. However, some of the recovered areas had not received the regulations issued by the Ministry of Education before, leaving them without a basis for implementation. Some provinces and departments in the free areas also requested the Ministry of Education to reissue these regulations so they could comply with them, due to relocation back to their original locations after the victory, where the documents were damaged by wind and rain during transport, or because of transportation difficulties that prevented the documents from being complete at this time. The Ministry of Education has now issued these three regulations to the education departments and bureaus of all recovered areas nationwide, and to those provinces and departments in the free areas that still require them. Special excerpts are listed below:</p>
<p>(A) Key Points for the Implementation of Educational Broadcasting</p>
<p>(1) The goals of the implementation of educational broadcasting should focus on cultivating national consciousness and a sense of national identity, enhancing political knowledge, increasing productivity, and promoting healthy entertainment, so as to promote social and cultural development. (2) The implementation of educational broadcasting is divided into two parts: school educational broadcasting and social educational broadcasting, which should be implemented simultaneously in schools at all levels and social education institutions. (3) Each provincial and municipal education department and bureau should establish an "Educational Broadcasting Guidance Office" to handle the guidance of educational broadcasting implementation agencies and schools throughout the province or city. The organizational regulations will be determined separately. Each province should divide its territory into several "Provincial Educational Broadcasting Zones" according to the administrative supervisory districts, in order to facilitate implementation. Those provinces that have not divided their territory into administrative supervisory districts may divide it into several zones by the provincial education department according to the size of the province, in accordance with the method of dividing administrative supervisory districts, and report it to the Ministry of Education for record. (5) Each city (directly administered municipality) should divide its urban area into several "Municipal Educational Broadcasting Zones" as appropriate, depending on the size of the urban area. Counties and cities (provincially administered cities) will not be divided separately. (6) Each provincial and municipal educational broadcasting zone should establish an "Educational Broadcasting Mobile Work Team" to conduct film broadcasting, sound broadcasting, and slide education in the designated area on a tour basis. They are all set up and managed by the provincial and municipal education departments and bureaus. The general rules of organization will be determined separately. When necessary, the aforementioned provincial and municipal educational broadcasting mobile work teams may be handled on behalf of the provincial and municipal public education centers within the area. (7) Each city and province may establish "Educational Broadcasting Stations" to implement educational broadcasting and rebroadcast programs from the Central Broadcasting Station. Each county and city may establish small broadcasting stations by the county and city public education centers to rebroadcast programs from the central, provincial, and municipal stations, and implement educational broadcasting on their own, in order to complete the national educational broadcasting network. (8) Provincial and municipal public education centers should set up radios to publicly listen to educational broadcasts. Those with sufficient funding should also carry out film and slide education. (9) Provincial and municipal libraries, gymnasiums, science museums, and other social education institutions and organizations should implement educational broadcasting, taking the circumstances into account. (10) County and city public education centers should set up radios to publicly listen to educational broadcasts. (11) Public and private secondary schools (including middle schools, normal schools, and vocational schools), and normal colleges should all set up radios to publicly listen to educational broadcasts and assist in teaching implementation. Normal colleges and normal schools should also conduct film education as appropriate to assist local education, and the implementation methods will be determined separately. (12) Schools at all levels conducting educational broadcasting should be responsible for handling the work of the teaching and guidance section, should target all students, and formulate implementation methods to ensure that they cooperate with teaching and training implementation to achieve practical results. Detailed methods will be determined separately. Within a possible scope, it may also coordinate with the school's social education promotion committee to educate the general public near the school. (13) The expenses for the implementation of educational broadcasting in each province, city, and county should be included in the annual budget of each province, city, and county. (14) The expenses for the implementation of educational broadcasting in schools and social education institutions and organizations at all levels should be included as a separate item in their regular budget. (15) Educational broadcasting teaching and technical personnel should be trained by central and provincial/municipal governments that set up specialized educational broadcasting schools and senior vocational schools, and in social education colleges, social education normal schools, social education normal departments, and senior industrial vocational schools, respectively. These institutions should set up educational broadcasting, film engineering, and wireless electrical engineering departments and groups to train them. (16) If each province and city lacks educational broadcasting staff, it may hold short-term training courses for educational broadcasting staff, convene current staff with poorer technical skills, or recruit personnel with considerable qualifications to receive training. After the training is completed, they will be assigned to positions. The training methods will be determined separately. (17) The equipment and supplies, films and slides required for the implementation of educational broadcasting may be purchased and distributed centrally by the Ministry of Education and the educational departments and bureaus of each province and city. (18) Each province and city should only screen educational films and slides that have been approved by the competent administrative authorities. (19) Films and slides produced by each institution, school, and organization must be sent to the Ministry of Education for approval before they can be publicly screened. (20) Educational broadcasting institutions (including schools at all levels, social education institutions, educational broadcasting mobile work teams, broadcasting stations, educational cinemas, or educational broadcasting halls, commercial cinemas, and other similar organizations) that have achieved outstanding results in film broadcasting, sound broadcasting, or slide education should be investigated and verified by the competent educational administrative authorities at the end of each year and reported to the Ministry of Education for awards. The award methods will be determined separately. (21) The education departments and bureaus of each province and city should include the implementation of educational broadcasting in the annual work report of the province and city education after the end of the year, and report it to the Ministry of Education for record, and use it as one of the assessment items for educational administration in each province and city. (22) Those who have made considerable contributions to the invention and creation of educational broadcasting teaching materials and equipment, or have made outstanding achievements in filming films and slides, may be given appropriate awards by the Ministry of Education. The award methods will be determined separately. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>The Captured Soldiers' Group Returns Gloriously to the Motherland's Embrace</h3>
<p>— Our Newspaper's Xuzhou Air Dispatch on the 10th, by Lou Jiangyun</p>
<p>Recently, the reporter, through a chance opportunity, was able to meet a group of compatriots who were captured during the War of Resistance and have recently returned to the country. In a brief conversation with them, I learned about their capture, their forced labor, and how they returned to the country. I will now report what I saw and heard to the readers:</p>
<p>Amazement, Sympathy, Respect</p>
<p>The day before yesterday afternoon, as I was leaving Xuzhou city, I saw a short line of people moving ahead. They were all wearing khaki-colored military uniforms and military overcoats. Beside them, several National Army soldiers in gray cotton military uniforms were escorting them. I thought: These must be newly disarmed Japanese soldiers being taken to a concentration camp. As I approached them, I listened carefully to the language coming from their ranks, and it was actually Chinese. I went in front of them to look at their faces, and I didn't see anyone with a beard, and their cap badges were all of the Blue Sky with a White Sun. I couldn't help but doubt: First, were they really enemies? Or were they compatriots?</p>
<p>They stopped in the open space in front of the ×× Headquarters gate. The platoon leader-like figure among the escorts went inside for a moment, and then an official came out with documents and a list to call roll. There were a total of eighty-eight people. After the roll call, they all sat down on the ground, looking exhausted, and spoke pure Chinese. At this point, I was certain they were Chinese. Japanese clothing cannot hide the essence of a Chinese person.</p>
<p>When facing enemy prisoners, one immediately recalls hatred. When facing compatriots, especially this group in strange attire and these pitiful, exhausted compatriots, one immediately feels sympathy. At the same time, I eagerly wanted to know their origins, so I picked out the one who looked the most energetic and asked him.</p>
<p>"We were captured during the War of Resistance and taken to the enemy country, and we have recently returned," he said, giving me a definite answer when he saw me asking him. This added an element of respect to my initial feeling of strangeness and subsequent pity.</p>
<p>However, this answer did not satisfy my curiosity. I wanted to know a more detailed and systematic account, so I disregarded their mental fatigue and pressed them for details about their experience and current goals.</p>
<p>"In April of the year before last (1944), we were fighting in Henan when we were captured by the enemy. In August of the same year, we were sent to Japan to do forced labor. After the war ended, in November of last year (1945), the Americans sent us to Qingdao by warship. Then the Qingdao Municipal Government sent us to Haizhou. Because transportation from Haizhou to here is inconvenient, the National Army stationed in Haizhou sent people to escort us here. Our only thought right now is to go home, but we are all from Henan and other places, and we can't go home right away. We also don't have any money, so we hope the authorities can provide us with relief!"</p>
<p>He was clearly very tired when he said this. They also said they hadn't eaten anything for six or seven hours! Fortunately, ×× Headquarters sent someone to entertain them. They were eager to eat and rest, so I asked them for their address and planned to visit them again tomorrow.</p>
<p>The next morning, I went to the Western-style house near a "Shinto Shrine" in Beiguan to see them—the house was indeed previously occupied by Japanese soldiers. I first found Jiang Shunchang, the platoon leader-like figure from yesterday. He and many others were warming themselves in the sun and chatting, looking much better than yesterday. When they saw me, they were as intimate as if they had recognized a friend, so I sat with them on the steps and talked.</p>
<p>First, I asked about their hometowns and the units they originally belonged to. It turned out that most of the eighty-eight people were from Henan, and their original units were different. Some said they were under General Hu Zongnan.</p>
<p>"Who says Hu Zongnan's troops only defend against the Communists and don't resist the Japanese? How could we have been captured by the enemy if we didn't resist them?" they said indignantly when I questioned them about a certain rumor.</p>
<p>Hardships on the Line of Death</p>
<p>Here, let me piece together the words they said, one after another, about the circumstances of their capture:</p>
<p>In March and April of 1944, the fighting in Henan was very fierce. This time we were captured, but the enemy also suffered heavy casualties.</p>
<p>I remember it was April 24th when we were captured. We were imprisoned in a concentration camp in Luoyang and suffered a lot. Each day, we were only given twenty-seven raw corn kernels (maize) and no water. How could we eat them? Many people died there, and many got sick. In May, we were marched away, and we all had to walk from Luoyang to Zhangde Prefecture (now Anyang, northern Henan). People who couldn't walk were beaten to death, and some died of illness. When we boarded the train in Zhangde Prefecture, the enemy was afraid we would jump off, so they tied us up with ropes, chained us together, and nailed the doors of the carriages shut. We were hot, stuffy, and crowded in the carriages, and some people suffocated to death. We stopped in Shijiazhuang (Hebei) for a few days, and if anyone tried to escape, they were beaten to death on the spot.</p>
<p>We were going to be sent to Tanggu to be transported to Japan, so we had to walk from Shijiazhuang again. It was already summer, the days were long, and we were only given seven ounces of flour a day, divided into three meals. We were never full. In Tanggu, they didn't even give us fresh water to drink, but forced us to drink black water (seawater, salt water). How could we walk? The suffering on the road is truly indescribable. It wasn't until the beginning of August that we arrived in Tanggu. Of the two hundred-plus people who were captured at the same time and place as us, only seventy-plus remained. The rest had starved to death, been beaten to death, or died of illness!</p>
<p>At the time, we expected great disasters to come and saw no end in sight. We really didn't want to live anymore, there was only death. But we always felt that as long as we were alive, there was still a glimmer of hope for revenge and redemption, so we endured and waited for the enemy to do with us as they pleased.</p>
<p>Around August 11th, tens of thousands of compatriots who had been captured on other battlefields had been gathered in Tanggu one after another. Then the enemy put us on warships and took us to Japan.</p>
<p>Watching ourselves being forced away from our homeland and into enemy territory, we felt very sad, and we couldn't help but shed tears.</p>
<p>Suffering in a Dark Hell</p>
<p>When we arrived in Japan, there were already several batches of compatriots with the same fate as us. The enemy divided these captured compatriots into different regions—Honshu, Kyushu, Shikoku, Hokkaido—to do forced labor for them, and they handed us over to the police and military police in the area to manage.</p>
<p>The types of forced labor were mainly building roads, mining, and digging tunnels. We were assigned to dig mountain tunnels.</p>
<p>Although the types of work were different, the management and treatment were generally the same.</p>
<p>They designated an area in the mountains or rural villages for us to live in. Every morning, they drove us to work, and in the evening, they drove us back to rest. They never allowed us to have contact with the outside world. Management was very strict. We were just like we were in hell, without any light of day. We didn't even think we were living human lives anymore.</p>
<p>What we wore, whether in winter or summer, was that broken single military uniform. They didn't give you any new clothes, and there were no shoes or socks, so everyone was barefoot all year round. In the mountain tunnels (or mines), it was like being burned by fire when it was hot, and freezing when it was cold. We are human beings, how could we bear it! I heard that almost half of those assigned to Hokkaido froze to death.</p>
<p>The best we could eat was eight ounces of flour a day, but usually it was half a catty of bean cakes, or even rice bran—bran without rice, just finely ground bran. If you got sick and couldn't work, they would only give you half of what you usually got, because you weren't working, so they didn't need to give you the benefits you deserved for working. Just imagine a sick person who can't get the food needed to sustain life, of course they will only get sicker and die.</p>
<p>The managing police and military police were like wolves and tigers, inflicting all kinds of abuse on us. If we didn't do something right, we would be whipped. We couldn't talk to each other casually, and we weren't allowed to speak loudly. We were really like cold insects, worse than cold insects in the dirt!</p>
<p>It is sad for anyone to be far away in a foreign country, but now we were not only in a foreign country, but an enemy country. They made us work for the enemy, and locked us in such a hell, living a life worse than cattle or horses. In this way, we added pain to pain, and hate to hate!</p>
<p>Today We See the Light of Day Again</p>
<p>This is a day we will remember, because it is the day we see the light of day again! At 8:00 AM on August 15th, 1945, we received the news of Japan's unconditional surrender. Before that, we felt that the enemy military police and police looked a little strange. Later, a Korean worker told us, "Japan has surrendered!"</p>
<p>This really surprised and delighted us. We looked at each other and smiled, then hugged each other and cried. We really didn't know how to describe our joy at that time.</p>
<p>Originally, we were cut off from outside news. Occasionally, a few Korean workers would bring in Japanese newspapers, but they were also false propaganda, and we couldn't read Japanese anyway. We could only guess the meaning from a few Chinese characters.</p>
<p>However, this news of victory spread to our ears so quickly. Good news seems to have wings and spreads especially fast!</p>
<p>In this way, we waited for liberation, and the enemy treated us a little differently.</p>
<p>Soon, the American troops came. That was the day we were officially liberated. They moved us to houses in the towns and cities, and changed our clothes. When we left that hellish labor camp, we also had an unusual feeling in our hearts.</p>
<p>In the past, we hated and despised the people of the enemy country, but we didn't dare to show it, and we never approached them. After liberation, when we saw the police and military police who had abused us before, we wanted to beat them. The American troops didn't interfere at first, but after we beat them, they came to persuade us and drag the enemy police and military police away, telling them not to come and get beaten.</p>
<p>Later, some Japanese soldiers who had participated in the war against China also returned to the country. We would beat any Japanese soldiers we heard speaking Chinese to us, because we were sure they were enemies who had beaten the Chinese.</p>
<p>The American troops were our friends after all. After the victory, they gave us clothes and food, which made our lives better. They were also very polite when we met. If they saw you were a Chinese soldier, they would shake your hand. Sometimes you could ride in their jeeps, and they would invite you to drink and watch their movies.</p>
<p>The resentment of the past year was finally vented, and we felt the joy of retribution. At the same time, we loved our motherland even more, thinking of our motherland and wanting to return to our motherland—the victorious motherland!</p>
<p>The Fate of the Aggressors</p>
<p>When they got to this point, I asked them to tell me a little about the situation in Japan. They said they hadn't been to many places, so they didn't know the details very well. The first thing they saw was when they passed through places like Tokyo, which were supposed to be cities, but were mostly rubble. This was the result of the Allied bombing during the war. It is said that large cities such as Osaka and Yokohama suffered the same fate. It can be said that the prosperity had been destroyed.</p>
<p>Secondly, in Japan, there were very few able-bodied men to be seen. Almost all administrative, educational, transportation, and other institutions were staffed by women. For example, civil servants, teachers, drivers, and shop assistants were all women. There were no soldiers to be seen in the country. The responsibility for maintaining law and order was entirely borne by the military police and police, who were all male. From this, it can also be seen that their manpower replenishment was exhausted. On the other hand, it can be seen that their women's working ability was strong.</p>
<p>Before the victory, although there was war-weariness, they still believed in the victory of this so-called "Greater East Asia War." Their training and education were originally aggressive.</p>
<p>Factories in Japan had stopped working, and the production of military supplies was not much, let alone anything else, so there was a general feeling of lack of materials, and the lives of the people were also very difficult.</p>
<p>When the American troops first arrived in Japan, most people in Japan, especially women, were afraid, but after they got used to it, it got much better.</p>
<p>Now, everything is under the direction of the American troops, and it is gradually being transformed!</p>
<p>Returning to the Embrace of the Motherland</p>
<p>Next, they talked about the situation before and after their return to the country:</p>
<p>It is feared that more than 150,000 (unconfirmed) of our compatriots who were captured during the war were sent to Japan. Some died in mines and mountain tunnels. Of these hundreds of thousands of people, most were from Henan, Hebei, and Shandong provinces, followed by other provinces in the north and the Northeast. After the victory, China sent people to negotiate the repatriation of prisoners of war. With the assistance of the American troops, they were sent back in batches by warship and disembarked in Tanggu, Dalian, and Qingdao according to their hometowns and were released to return home.</p>
<p>Most of us were in the 22nd or 23rd batches. We boarded the ship in Japan on November 30th of last year (1945), left the port on December 1st, and arrived in Qingdao on the 5th of the same month.</p>
<p>Before the American troops sent us back to the country, they gave us winter clothes and travel expenses of 100 Japanese yen per person. When we arrived in Qingdao, it was exchanged for 1,000 yuan in national currency, and the mayor of Qingdao gave us each a certificate for overseas Chinese returning to the country.</p>
<p>The mayor of Qingdao sent people to send us to Haizhou on December 20th. In Qingdao, food and accommodation were provided, and there were also people to entertain us in Haizhou. Because transportation from Haizhou to Xuzhou had not yet resumed, a certain division of the National Army stationed in Haizhou sent officers and soldiers to escort us. We walked for many days on the road, and the money was used up. The journey was very difficult, and today we have arrived in Xuzhou.</p>
<p>A Heartfelt Epilogue</p>
<p>A Heartfelt Epilogue</p>
<p>The conversation could have stopped here, but after hearing these words, my admirable and sympathetic heart spontaneously arose. I felt that I couldn't bear to leave them right away, and I felt that there was something that could not be fully expressed in words. They also seemed to have many things to say to a familiar friend. After a few seconds of silence, one person opened his mouth heavily.</p>
<p>He said: "We were originally ordinary people from our hometowns. We are the sons of our parents who did not die in battle, were not dragged to death on the long journey after being captured, and did not die from abuse while doing forced labor in the enemy country. Today, the War of Resistance has been victorious, and we have seen the light of day again. We can be said to have lived three lifetimes. We feel deeply ashamed of being captured in battle. We are very fortunate to be able to return alive, and we are extremely excited and happy about the victory of the national War of Resistance. From now on, we will increase our patriotic enthusiasm!"</p>
<p>"After we were captured, we did not communicate with our hometowns. Our parents and friends at home are worrying about whether their sons are alive or dead during the victory of the War of Resistance. We fully expected to return to our homeland and enjoy family happiness after returning to the country. Who knew that we would first encounter the destruction of transportation, which increased our difficulties. Our hometowns have not yet been pacified, so we have a home we cannot return to, and life is very difficult, which really makes our hearts feel like they are being fried! Thinking that we have suffered for the War of Resistance, but today some people are destroying the fruits of the country's victory in the War of Resistance and preventing us from tasting this joy, it is even more heartbreaking!"</p>
<p>"Especially when we return to the country and see that our authorities are so lenient and generous to enemy prisoners of war, and see that their clothes and food are abundant and they are full of energy, we really don't know what to think!"</p>
<p>"We hope that the authorities can understand our hard work and give us effective relief!"</p>
<p>Originally, I was excited to get some new insights, but after hearing their words, I felt very uneasy. However, the reality is like this. What can I say to comfort these respectable soldiers?</p>
<p>I had to say goodbye to them, promising to see them again when I had the chance, and then I walked back with heavy steps, thinking as I went.</p>
<p>"We hope that the authorities will give effective relief." I also shouted this. (3, 10)</p>
<h3>Crossing the Yellow River and Inspecting Xinxiang and Anyang</h3>
<p>— Special Dispatch from this Newspaper on the 13th - Sent by Fan Shiqin</p>
<p>The Pinghan Railway line past Guang Kai Wu has a desolate feel. The mountains on both sides have no trees. At most, one or two bare trees decorate them, so all one sees is a stretch of yellow, extremely monotonous. Moreover, the wind and sand are heavy, and heaven and earth become one color. There are no grass huts on or below the mountains, only a few caves. Occasionally, one or two ragged residents with slow movements emerge from the caves. This scene is perhaps a truly authentic Chinese scene.</p>
<p>On the south bank of the Yellow River, the enemy once formed a desperate defense. On the mountain to the left of the bank, there is a water tower. It is said that it was built by the enemy. We did not notice this water tower in the past, so we did not repel the enemy when attacking them, because the enemy had drinking water to sustain the battle. At the foot of the southern bank of the mountains, there are permanent enemy fortifications, exceptionally sturdy. Even though fortresses may seem impregnable, they ultimately cannot be relied upon, which the enemy did not expect.</p>
<p>Traveling on the Yellow River Railway Bridge Takes Three Quarters of an Hour</p>
<p>After passing through a five-minute tunnel, we arrived at the Yellow River Railway Bridge. The Yellow River Railway Bridge is the third largest engineering feat in China after the Great Wall and the Grand Canal. The train took forty-five minutes to cross the iron bridge. Traveling on the bridge feels like a ship sailing on the ocean. When the bridge was occupied by the enemy, it was bombed by us countless times. Judging from the repaired iron bars on the bridge, it was bombed almost every few feet. The bridge was bombed and repaired repeatedly, experiencing countless such events.</p>
<p>The Water Flow Resembles the Eight Trigrams Diagram, Causing Dizziness</p>
<p>The Yellow River's water flow is sometimes slow and sometimes rapid, flowing forward, backward, with tributaries and a main stream. It flows rapidly where there are sandbars or in narrower areas, and slowly in wider areas. The water seems to have no fixed direction, flowing forward where there is a path and backward where there is none; however, the main stream and tributaries can be seen in the middle of the Yellow River Railway Bridge. Looking around, the water resembles the Eight Trigrams Diagram, causing people to feel dizzy. Moreover, there is ice, snow, and sand beaches, water, ice, snow, and sand, moving and still, forming a large pattern.</p>
<p>Besides a few boats moored along the banks of the Yellow River, the rest is an endless expanse, quite monotonous. In the ocean, one can often see seagulls soaring freely back and forth, but no birds can be seen in the Yellow River.</p>
<p>Outside Tagang Gao Village Bridge, Telegraph Poles Are Damaged</p>
<p>After crossing the Yellow River, the traces of Communist army sabotage are everywhere. The telegraph poles along the way are short, only five or six feet long, because they were cut down and then reburied. The porcelain insulators on the telegraph poles are shattered on the ground, showing a strong sense of destruction. According to the railway bureau, the section from Xinxiang to Anyang was started on October 13th and completed on November 15th, with repeated repairs and sabotages in between. The Tagang north of Weihui and the Gao Village Bridge south of Tangyin were damaged the most, and the road workers were almost killed. The rails were carried to the foot of the Taihang Mountains. The suffering falls on the common people, who were ordered by the Communist army to move them, and then ordered by the railway bureau to move them back.</p>
<p>It is unwise for a couple to quarrel and break things in a family. After all, these things belong to the family, and won't they have to spend money to buy them again when everyone makes up in the future?</p>
<p>Immersed in Ancient Roman Times, Appreciating Pillboxes</p>
<p>The area forty li west of Xinxiang is the famous Taihang Mountains, the base of the Communist army. Therefore, pillboxes were built on the west side of the railway, but not on the east side. I enjoy looking at these pillboxes, which come in various styles, as if I were in Roman times. In addition, I also saw several enemy pillboxes, which were sturdy but lacked artistic sense. The pillboxes built by the National Army used local materials and took on the shape of the materials, which were both economical and beautiful, and also adequate to withstand the artillery fire of the Communist army. I always feel that they are unnecessary and necessary, so I viewed them all the way with an artistic eye.</p>
<p>Driving the Common People to Fight, the Guilt Should Be Borne</p>
<p>The Communist Party attacked Xinxiang, occupied Tangyin, and threatened Anyang. It sounds terrible. Most of those who died were common people, who were driven by the Communist army to fight on the front lines. The discipline of the Communist army is not bad, and they don't kill people indiscriminately, but not killing the people and driving them to fight amounts to a great sin of killing people in droves.</p>
<p>When I went to northern Henan, it was after the ceasefire order was issued, but there were still some minor conflicts ahead. As time gradually passed, the conflicts decreased, but there were still many problems. The propaganda from the Communist Party side confused us, saying that this ceasefire was because the central government was unable to fight anymore, and the Political Consultative Conference had decided to assign northern China to the Communist Party. Such propaganda was often heard where the two armies met, but once we moved a little further away, we no longer understood the situation, and such propaganda no longer reached our ears.</p>
<p>The Situation in Various Counties of Northern Henan Is Bitter, Taking Xinxiang as an Example</p>
<p>In Xinxiang, northern Henan, relying on the Taihang Mountains to the north and facing the Yellow River to the south, and bordering the Pinghan, Daoqing, and Bianxin main lines, the terrain is very important. Jixian has the Bi Gan tomb, and Tangyin has the Yue Wu Mu Temple, which can inspire people's sense of justice. The tomb of Yuan Shikai in Anyang and the rise of Cao Cao after being in Anyang make people think of the similarities between the two. The presence of Yue Wu Mu in Tangyin and Han Zhong Xian in Anyang are like eternal memories of Yexia. Tangyin also has the Zili City and the Wen Wang Temple, which also make people reminisce.</p>
<p>Considering the situation in Henan, Wan, Luo, and Ye are the three most famous regions. Anyang is Yedi. I think Anyang is considered important because it is at the crossroads of north and south and because of its production of coal, cotton, and wheat. On the other hand, when we look at the common people, they are really suffering too much. In various counties of northern Henan, the losses from the drought alone in 1941 and 1942 were more than 80%; from 1942 to 1944, the losses from insect plagues were at least 40% and at most 90%. It is said that at least 1,389,000 people in northern Henan need help.</p>
<p>Heavy Losses in the War, the Scarcity of Food Is the Most Frightening</p>
<p>In Xinxiang County alone, 62,799 houses were destroyed in the war, and 35,843 were destroyed by the Communist army; the loss of stored grain in the war was 17,837 tons, 5,200 tons were lost to the Communist army, and 58,450 tons were lost to drought and locusts. The loss of cattle and horses in the chaos was 12,476, and 528 were seized by the Communist army. From Xinxiang County, we can see the situation in various counties of northern Henan. What is currently lacking most in northern Henan is food, especially in Tangyin, because Tangyin was occupied by the Communist army for eighteen days, and seven hundred large armies carried grain every day, leaving the area completely empty.</p>
<p>Now northern Henan is like a stiff snake, unable to move. It can only breathe a little in the south, otherwise it will suffocate. Currently, the southern section of the Pinghan Road only reaches Anyang, and five li north of Anyang is no longer safe.</p>
<p>Xinxiang has an administrative inspector and security commander, Zhang Jingzhong, who is in his thirties, looks like a junior civil servant, speaks without being startling, and acts without being experienced, but is very admirable. During the chaos, he went from district chief to county magistrate, and from county magistrate to commissioner. He is from the vicinity of Xinxiang. When northern Henan was occupied, he was the first to advocate returning to northern Henan to fight the enemy. He went from district chief to county magistrate, and from county magistrate to commissioner through his own struggles. The government's repeated promotion of this patriot is the most practical form of praise.</p>
<h3>Those Who Fear the World Is Not in Chaos, Please Look at the Remains of Eight Million Deaths - Chilean Poet Gabriela Mistral Expresses Her Thoughts</h3>
<p>Gabriela Mistral, a Chilean poet who was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1945 and is currently the Consul in Los Angeles, recently traveled to this place after visiting England, France, Sweden, and Italy. According to her observations on her European tour, there is a dangerous trend in Europe that the Third World War is inevitable. "Those who fear the world is not in chaos should go to various places and look at the remains of eight million deaths!" Ms. Mistral also praised "British democratic politics, Swedish organizational capabilities, and France's continued love of literature, even after the terrible war, which is astonishing. Italy also has a latent spirit of resilience and remains one of the best organized Latin nations in Europe." However, the countless deaths in this war are truly unforgettable. The only way to prevent future wars is to make the public fully aware of international events, "without false reports causing panic." Writers and reporters in various countries have a great responsibility in this regard, "to dedicate themselves to the struggle for truth." Fascism is now showing signs of resurgence, and writers of good will and progressives must work together so that we will not be submerged by it again. In today's world, we are in a precarious state. Fascism is trying to take advantage of the danger, and we must guard against it early. With famine still rampant in Europe, the United States has a moral obligation to help all the countries of the world whose wounds are clearly visible. If we want to save Latin culture from extinction in the next fifty years, North and South America must work together to provide relief. If we want our descendants to inherit the work of peace and reconstruction, we must help and protect the children of Europe. Ms. Mistral concluded by saying that she will be traveling to Washington in the coming days, and then returning to New York in May to attend a meeting of the United Nations Committee on the Status of Women.

<p>Japanese Soldiers in Shanghai Evacuated and Sent Back Home</p>

<p>Chronicles</p>
<h3>Remembering the Poet Yang Yunshi (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Tang Liyan</p>
<p>Mr. Yang Yunshi served as the Consul-General in Singapore in the late Qing Dynasty, as evidenced by poems such as "Lamenting the South Sea". He purchased tens of thousands of acres of land in Southeast Asia to plant rubber trees, which he could do because he was quite wealthy. However, he returned to China between the Xin Hai and Ren Zi years. Mr. Yang himself said that he resigned and returned after the imperial abdication edict was issued. Some say that after the outbreak of the European War, the price of rubber plummeted, the rubber plantation was overgrown with weeds, he had no money to pay taxes, and the rubber forest was confiscated by the government, so he returned empty-handed. This is a misunderstanding. It is also true that Mr. Yang went to Shenyang to rely on the young marshal Zhang after the defeat of General Wu. However, it is a great mistake to say that Mr. Yang was the editor of Du Wenren's notes. The editors of the society's newsletter were Yang Xizi (Du) earlier, and Yang Qianli (Yi Shan) later. Although they were both surnamed Yang and were famous scholars of their time, they had nothing to do with Mr. Yang.</p>
<p>Mr. Yang was a spoiled guest of the Prime Minister's residence in his youth, and was with the old generals of the Huai Army day and night. After middle age, he joined General Wu's staff, and was well known to the Beiyang soldiers. I was influenced by the Three Principles of the People from a young age, and received special recognition from the late Premier before I was married. Our environments were completely different, and our thoughts were also different, so we often disagreed in our discussions. However, Mr. Yang humbly accepted my views. He once asked me to give lectures on the history of the Kuomintang while he reported on old stories of Beiyang. Mr. Yang was addicted to opium, lying in a cloud of smoke, rarely going out except to enjoy landscapes. With nothing to do all day, we each recounted what we had seen and heard to pass the time, sometimes smiling, sometimes sighing. We were not like old palace maids gossiping about the Kaiyuan and Tianbao eras.</p>
<p>Mr. Yang once said that Wu Meicun was a man of ancient sorrow. Before the age of strength, he suffered a tragic upheaval. He did not have enough farmland to support his family, had elderly parents above him, and young children below him. His relatives and friends urged him to quickly prepare for burial, but he had no choice but to submit. Even after he served the Qing Dynasty as the Director of the Imperial Academy, he still did not lose his scholarly nature. Judging from his "He Xin Liang" poem written while sick, and his will to be buried in monk's robes with the inscription "Poet Wu Meicun" on his tombstone, his inner guilt and mental anguish can be seen. However, critics do not examine this, and use the name of a wise man to over-praise him. Do they know that this is not the way to judge people and their times? Moreover, the generals of the late Ming Dynasty were arrogant and undisciplined. When the Eight Banners entered the pass, they surrendered at the sight of the wind, and millions of soldiers could not defend an inch of land. They should not be held accountable. Is it appropriate to attribute the crime of national subjugation to Gui Youguang and Wu Meicun? His words can be said to be extremely poignant. All those present were deeply touched by this. However, Mr. Yang never accepted any official position in Wu's staff. Even for a small position, he would say that he would return to the mountains in white clothes after the affair was completed. How few people are as strict with themselves and lenient with others as Mr. Yang. Alas, this can be said to those who understand, but it is difficult to talk to vulgar people about it.</p>
<p>Mr. Yang's "Chang Jiang Wan Li Lou Poetry Collection" was compiled in the summer of 1929, with a total of 1,452 poems and 223 lyrics. In the winter of 1930, he added 153 poems. Some are majestic and magnificent, some are clear and subtle, some are lofty and flowing, and some are charming and graceful. The majestic and elegant styles are all expressed to the fullest, depending on the topic. But I especially love his seven-character ancient poems, such as "Song of Princess Changping", "Song of Volcano" (both poems are over two thousand words long), "Song of Jin Gu Garden", and "Introduction to Tanqing" (both poems are over a thousand words long), all of which are magnificent and full of energy. (The length of lyrics is not included). Combining the historical writing style of Sima Qian, the immortal talent of Li Bai, the scholarly ability of Du Fu, and the flowery language of Wen Tingyun and Li Shangyin, he has created his own style. It should make Li Bai and Wu Meicun bow down together. How can those who merely mutter and stammer hope to reach his heights? However, some think that Mr. Yang's poems do not escape the style of Fan (Fan Shan) and Yi (Shi Fu), and that there is a difference between them and the two Chen (Shi Yi and Chen Sanli). It can truly be said that they do not know poetry.</p>
<p>From the Han and Wei dynasties to the Tang dynasty, poetry was like the Yellow River rushing to the sea, never to return. Therefore, the Song people excelled in lyrics, and the Yuan people excelled in tunes, each with their own merits. The Ming people learned from the Tang, but only imitated the form and not the spirit, like parrots. Wu Meicun lived in a chaotic world and grieved for the loss of the country. Therefore, his poems, in the midst of amazing talent, contain a deep and desolate meaning. After Wang Shizhen, this style declined, and the only one who could revive it was Ding Ling. Mr. Yang's poems are very similar to Wu Meicun's, but he does not establish his own school. He rarely praised or criticized the Jiangxi school of poetry of his time. He once said, "The theory of schools is close to their nature. How can you shoot at a target? It can be used to discipline oneself, but not to judge others." Therefore, he often corresponded with Shi Yi, and his discussions with me about poetry were especially rewarding. I said that the prose of Tongcheng, the poetry of Jiangxi, and the lyrics of Erya were already at a dead end. When one is exhausted, one must change, and change leads to progress. Although the new style poems created by Hu Shih and Guo Moruo have not yet succeeded, it is generally recognized by those who have knowledge that poetry cannot remain unchanged. Mr. Yang agreed with this. Even Shi Yi once said to me personally, "Your poems are close to the tone of the Tang dynasty. There is no need to study the Song dynasty." His style and demeanor were extraordinary. Whenever I think of the words of the two gentlemen, I cannot help but be filled with emotion.</p>
<p>Mr. Yang's lyrics, short lyrics like flower questions, slow lyrics like the Northern Song Dynasty, are especially close to Li Yu and Feng Yansi of the Southern Tang Dynasty. Their meaning is far and subtle, their emotions are deep and refined, and their voices are sharp and sad. Their surging emotions and grief-stricken beauty, and their clear phrases and sentences, form a unique and elegant style. In the Qing Dynasty, only Nalan Xingde and Liang Qingbiao could compare with them. They cannot be matched by Zhu Yizun or Chen Weisong. Modern people specialize in Erya, but even the top students are like dismantling an eight-treasure pavilion, and they cannot put the pieces back together, let alone those who cannot even do this. Mr. Yang's lyrics are like a fairy maiden, transcending the dust and not eating the food of the human world. They should be read by beautiful women with famous flowers.</p>
<p>Mr. Yang was unrestrained, unconventional, extremely talented, and had many good stories to tell over wine. His love affair with Chen Mei Mei was especially well-known. "Since the new poems have spread to thousands of mouths, every family talks about Yang Yunqi." He is no less than Du Mu's Liuyingqing. Mei Mei was a famous courtesan from Yue's Zheluocun. Around 1929, General Wu rose again, and Mr. Yang followed him to Han. On the night of the Lantern Festival, lanterns were lit for a night of drinking. Colleagues saw that Mr. Yang was depressed because he had just written a poem mourning his late wife, so they summoned her. Mei Mei recognized Mr. Yang at a glance and fell in love with him, willing to serve him. Mr. Yang also treated her as a confidante in the world, and gave her no less than a hundred poems. At that time, military messages were frequent, and Mr. Yang drafted proclamations during the day and slept with Mei Mei at night. In the spring night, he hosted a banquet for the generals at Xiaomilou:</p>
<p>Beautiful women from the South dance in silk skirts,</p>
<p>The sounds of silk and bamboo fill the Jiangguan on this beautiful spring day.</p>
<p>The official army reports at night that the capital has been recovered,</p>
<p>Red sleeves hold lanterns to write drafts.</p>
<p>The Jingnong staff are indulging in pleasure,</p>
<p>Sweeping away a thousand troops to sweep away flowers.</p>
<p>Earning the fame of a poet throughout Wu and Chu,</p>
<p>The price of paper rises in the spring for the Chen family.</p>
<p>A hundred battles rage in the Central Plains.</p>
<p>The generals at the banquet cry out in their drunken stupor.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister has already captured the Huaixi bandits,</p>
<p>Earning red makeup? Laughing without a care? (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Blessing</h3>
<p>— Huai Yu</p>
<p>In these years of chaos and scarcity, when conflicts are endless, we met by chance in a corner of this metropolis. Because of our shared interests and the fact that we worked together day and night, we gradually got to know each other, progressing to the point where we understood each other. Finally, with the spread of the news of victory, we went our separate ways. Living in an era of unpredictable changes, genuine friendship seems to be a precious existence. However, now I cannot describe the joys of those years with endless sorrow. Perhaps my sorrow is superfluous, then I would like to bless the eternal life of our friendship with ten thousand sincere hearts.</p>
<p>That night, in the midst of flickering lights and lively wine drinking, when I noticed your smiling face, I could not help but silently bless you, my friend, you are lucky - although we live in what is called a world of people today, in this ancient country, when freedom is still hidden in golden houses by a few, a free union is always a praiseworthy and enviable thing. I am not very clear about how you two fell in love, but I can determine that this is entirely due to your free will, without any worldly prejudices and outdated ideas mixed in. But in addition to being pleased and celebrating, I am filled with the sorrow of losing a companion. Many people remind me that the distance between us has been infinitely stretched, and some people send me well-intentioned inquiries - will you suffer from loneliness in the future? My friend, although these are all facts? I doubt it, but I am also confused, so I eagerly look forward to your reply.</p>
<p>Do you still remember that, just as the war unexpectedly ended, and we were freed from the threat of bombing and death, by chance, we met in the mid-autumn season and traveled together to Wuling; do you still remember that, on a morning when the rain had just cleared, we went boating on the lake together, talking about our lives in the shimmering light and mountain shadows; do you still remember that, in that noisy and hot inn, we slept side by side on the same bed, and used endless conversation to dispel so many sleepless nights? Do you still remember that, in countless times of spending money to enjoy ourselves, we raised our glasses to wish each other well for the days to come? Do you still remember that, under the bright starry sky, we made many promises for our future? Now, everything has disappeared with time, and the past situation will be like flowing water, never to return, how can I not add infinite sorrow! If one day I return to the old place, and look at the rivers and mountains, how can I not feel a sense of missing old friends?</p>
<p>Although this is the case, I still admit that the life of two sexes is the happiest and most fulfilling life in the world, and we should strive to achieve it to the best of our ability. Because, human beings are striving to continuously improve and improve their lives, and in the new world of the future, all kinds of abnormal psychology caused by poor environment will be completely eliminated. Therefore, we can believe that marriage is a major change in human relations. If the pre-marital girlhood is full of fantasy and nothingness, then the post-marital life together will be a more realistic and ordinary day. On this point, we have quite similar uninhibited personalities and absurd ideas. In our subconscious, there are often some legendary characters and events, and in order to satisfy the psychology of heroism, we have also created objects of worship for each other. These naive ideas, although not a serious illness, are a ridiculous mistake. I think that in the days to come, you will gradually abandon them, without any nostalgia, just like people throw away their old shoes of yesterday. People should be full of ideals, and at the same time they should pursue their ideals, and constantly strive to realize their ideals. But, more importantly, our ideals must take root in the soil, absorb sunshine and moisture, and grow firmly. Do not imagine it as a mirage, which can be fabricated out of thin air. I am willing to rely on your help to correct myself, but I do not know if you are still as generous as you used to be?</p>
<p>In many places, someone has made a seemingly right and wrong prediction - saying "marriage is the tomb of love". In my simple thinking, I always feel that it is full of falsehood and error, and I hope that my opinion can be confirmed by you. Recently, in an article, I saw a sentence that contradicts the above view, he told us - "Marriage is a boat of fate." I think this is a more reasonable statement. In happy days, "marriage" is no longer "the tomb of love", but "the promotion of love", my friend, I hope you two work together, and use the light of love to illuminate all the people living in suffering, and encourage them to have the courage to live, and to pursue the truth!</p>
<p>Finally, I bless you with ten thousand sincerity; I also bless the eternal life of our friendship with ten thousand sincerity.</p>
<h3>Thorns</h3>
<p>— Shi Jimi</p>
<p>Those who love roses hate the thorns on the rose bush, perhaps because they were once pricked by them when picking the roses. Otherwise, why would they curse them so meaninglessly? Don't they know that the beauty of the rose lies in the fact that it blooms amidst thorns?</p>
<p>Without thorns, the value of the rose would be ordinary. True, the rose has beautiful delicate red petals and a rich fragrance, but isn't the color of the peach blossom also beautiful? Isn't the fragrance of the osmanthus even stronger?</p>
<p>From the rose, we think of people. I have always been fascinated by the saying, "The most beautiful life is one that can bear suffering." The most beautiful life can only be seen in suffering. All wealth, glory, fleeting happiness and laughter cannot be considered the most beautiful life, absolutely not.</p>
<p>The greatness of Christianity does not lie in the fact that it has followers all over the world today, and that there are so many churches, but in the suffering it endured in the beginning, that difficult period of oppression. Revolution is not glorious because of its success; glory lies in the bloodshed and sacrifice of patriots, the tears of orphans and widows, prisoners shackled in jail, and the heroic souls who never return from the battlefield...</p>
<p>We do not advocate defeatism, but we must believe that suffering is great and has glory.</p>
<p>To take the most recent and obvious example: Mei Lanfang's nobility and glory do not come from singing "Fei Zhen'e Assassinating the Tiger" in the most luxurious and beautiful theater in Shanghai today, with tens of thousands of listeners and viewers, and having been praised by Chairman Chiang, and supported unanimously by Chinese and foreigners. His most noteworthy achievement is that he grew a beard and stopped singing during the eight years of the War of Resistance, spending those eight years in hardship and poverty.</p>
<p>Thorns are good. They are the thorns of life, and also the touchstone of life. Through them, we know what is good and bad, heroes and weaklings, supermen and mediocrities. We distinguish between beauty and ugliness.</p>
<h3>Our Opinions on the Shanghai Art Association</h3>
<p>— Song Wenzhao, Shi Chongpeng</p>
<p>No one can deny, and need not deny, that Shanghai is the birthplace of emerging art in China. All art movements in the past originated in Shanghai and then spread to all parts of the country.</p>
<p>The reason why Shanghai's art scene is so prosperous lies in its socio-economic conditions. Western culture and Western art, brought in by international capitalists, first landed in Shanghai. As a result, emerging art was produced in Shanghai, eliminating, replacing, or transforming traditional feudal art. This influence is the basic condition for the development of emerging art throughout the country, which is a very obvious fact.</p>
<p>If we ask about the Shanghai New Art phenomenon in the past thirty years, what we cannot forget is that the first highest art academy in China was founded in Shanghai, and famous art societies—the Tianma Society, the Jue Lan Society, the China Art Education Society...—were all born in Shanghai. The first National Art Exhibition and the National Children's Art Exhibition were also launched in Shanghai. In short, Shanghai is not only the birthplace of emerging art in China, but simply the cradle of Chinese New Art.</p>
<p>During the eight years of the War of Resistance, especially in the last four years, Shanghai's art scene performed very poorly due to the limitations of objective conditions. Only a few art writers held some personal exhibitions. Apart from this, we dare not admit that there were any art movements. However, we cannot ignore the fact that loyal art workers firmly stayed in Shanghai, and some went to the rear to participate in actual resistance and construction work.</p>
<p>After a period of desolation, the Shanghai art movement became lively again with the arrival of victory. Writers who had been dormant for a long time, and many art workers who returned to Shanghai from the interior, were constantly planning how to restore the historical glory of the Shanghai art movement. Taking advantage of this opportunity, the authorities in charge of cultural movements specially invited art workers in Shanghai to organize the Shanghai Art Association to promote the Shanghai art movement.</p>
<p>We, as old art workers in Shanghai, are in principle in favor of and have unlimited hope for it, but technically, we have to express some opinions.</p>
<p>The first is the nature of the Art Association. The Shanghai Art Association should aim to promote the art movement in Shanghai and throughout China. Therefore, its nature should not be a writers' group of painters, musicians, sculptors, calligraphers, etc., but should include art critics, art educators, and even all those engaged in artistic activities.</p>
<p>Following the first question is the question of the work of the Art Association. The Art Association should not only pay attention to the production and publication of artistic works, and the financial assistance for the lives of art writers, and the exposure of collaborators and traitors. We believe that the investigation and research of Chinese and foreign art, the planning and promotion of art education, and the editing and publication of art translations are also not to be overlooked.</p>
<p>The third is the question of the direction of the Art Association. The Art Association, which was born in the democratic atmosphere spreading around the world, should itself be a very democratic organization, and the target of the art movement should be the people. Therefore, we must first engage in popular art movements, and at the same time improve the essence of art movements. We do not have to completely abandon traditional art forms, but we should definitely incorporate realistic content to get closer to the masses. Only an art movement that takes the masses as its sole target can penetrate into the democratic torrent of the great era, otherwise it will only be a formalistic group of art workers.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the establishment of the Shanghai Art Association, we dare to offer our humble opinions to the Art Association. What do social figures think of the opinions we have put forward?</p>
<h3>Double Flying (22)</h3>
<p>— Zhao Qingge</p>
<p>Almost everyone in Jingzhou knew all of this. Naturally, Mrs. Mo knew it most clearly. Mrs. Mo had been involved throughout the process, and even some of her opinions were included. Even Li Yun, who was only seven years old, could see it clearly. But, there was only one person who didn't know. How strange! Maybe this person knew it in his heart, but pretended not to know. This person had already "misted" his entire life. He didn't need to understand many things. He needed everything to cover him up, and he covered himself up. Only in this way could this person live peacefully amidst the troubles of the world. He understood that everything in the universe had an ugly side, and even himself was not entirely good.</p>
<p>Therefore, he would rather look at everything with misty eyes; otherwise, if one day he opened the mist curtain and looked at everything, he would be devoured by ugliness! Because he judged that he was no longer able to overcome ugliness.</p>
<p>This person's philosophy is a mixture of being in the world and out of the world. This person is smart and happy. This person is our Old Master Weng.</p>
<p>Only one morning, Old Master Weng woke up earlier than usual. So he opened his eyes and wanted to indulge, but he found that his smoking set was not beside him. He called Li Yun to ask, and Li Yun told him naively:</p>
<p>"It's in Wang's room. Boss Shi is using it. I'll go get it!" Li Yun said, preparing to go get it naively.</p>
<p>Old Master Weng grabbed Li Yun, shook his head with a wry smile, and said:</p>
<p>"Dad doesn't need it anymore. Dad wants to sleep. Good child, don't disturb Mom."</p>
<p>Sure enough, Old Master Weng yawned and fell asleep again in this slight layer of mist exhaled.</p>
<p>Li Yun found this situation very funny. She laughed at Old Master Weng for falling asleep so easily. Although she didn't tell Mrs. Weng about this matter at the time, she told Li Hua. Not only this matter, but everything she collected in her little eyes, she told Li Hua without omission. Because Li Hua was her only friend. And Li Hua told everything to Old Master Mo, because Old Master Mo was Li Hua's only friend.</p>
<p>Old Master Weng could ignore it, but Old Master Mo couldn't! So one day, he used the excuse of drinking to get Old Master Weng out. They went to a small tavern. After three cups, Old Master Mo took advantage of the alcohol to open this can of worms. He said in a very subtle tone:</p>
<p>"Brother, there are some rumors circulating in Jingzhou that are disrespectful to us Manchus, saying that we are open-minded; that women don't bind their feet anymore; and that they can even go to restaurants to eat and drink; and what about supporting actors... etc. I don't know if you've heard about it?"</p>
<p>"Ah? Is there such a thing?" Old Master Weng pretended to be surprised, but then he quickly said, "Who cares? Anyway, they're talking about women, not us men, so brother doesn't need to be bothered."</p>

<h3>Letter from the Chuansha County Government</h3>
<p>Editor: Having read Mr. Chen Bowei's letter from the Chuansha Elementary School colleagues in your newspaper's social service column on March 18th, the situation he described does not match the facts. Although the county's finances are indeed very difficult, since County Magistrate Wang Yawu took office in January of this year, he has been working hard to plan, and all necessary expenses have been carefully considered and distributed in a coordinated manner, and he is very concerned about the elementary school expenses. For example, the total expenditure of the county in January was less than 4 million yuan. At that time, although the elementary schools had already started their vacation, each school and each class was still given 10,000 yuan for miscellaneous expenses, totaling 330,000 yuan, accounting for 10% of the total expenditure of the county for the entire month. The total expenditure of the county in February was 9 million yuan, and the actual expenditure for elementary schools was 1 million yuan, plus an additional 1.2 million yuan for equipment subsidies, totaling 2.2 million yuan, accounting for more than 20% of the total expenditure of the county for the entire month. This is the actual situation, and the county government and our committee have records to check. Your newspaper is enthusiastic about education and provides encouragement, for which we are very grateful. We are sending you a special letter to report on the distribution of education funds in the county, and we ask that your newspaper publish it to clarify the truth. Respectfully, Lu Keren, Chairman of the Finance Committee of Chuansha County</p>
