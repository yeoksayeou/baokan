<h3 id="c1">和平商談重趨活躍　馬帥分別約晤俞周談話　並與司徒研討雙方意見 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>〔本報南京九日電〕馬歇爾特使，九日晨九時約晤司徒大使，至九時三刻始舉，據聞談話內容爲司徒大使與周恩來談話結果及蔣主席在廣山對馬帥表示之政府太度，綜合研討，此爲廣續與周思來商談之根據。愈大難於十時半往訪，至十二時半出，正午四時周思來照約訪馬帥，旋司徒大使於七時到，即同進晚餐，周氏於七時半辭出，司徒大使則續談至十一時許始出，聞司徒大使與馬帥之晤談，係以美國國內對安平事件之態度有所討論。雙馬帥續約周恩來於十日上午十時再行接談。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京九日電〕因意外枝節，一度暫時沉寂之和平商談，自馬爾特使返京後，又趨活躍。馬帥九日晨與司徒雷登大使晤議，旋接見俞部長大維，午後四時半接見中共代表周恩來氏，談話內容未悉。</p>
<p>〔合衆社南京九日電〕據報載：美國務院最近三次致電馬歇爾，對美陸戰隊正北平附近被襲擊事表示不滿，但此說未經官方證實。又馬歇爾與司徒雷登大使，希望共黨關與其態度，以便和平談判得告成功。</p>
<h3 id="c2">陳立夫對外記者談　中共正製造內戰　現方拖延時間充實力量 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>〔聯合社本市訊〕組織部長陳立夫，今日接見聯合社記者，據談：中國共產黨正在製造內戰，而將責任置諸他人肩上。共產黨言行不符，慣於欺騙，發言毫無價值，彼等現正拖延時間。國民黨之目的，係欲循政治途徑解決中國局勢，而中共則於談判時，徒事拖延，藉以爭取時間，充實力量，守候機會，消滅國民黨。中共不許其他各黨在統治區內有所活動，馬歇爾特使及司徒雷登大使「態度異常誠懇，且甚努力」。馬特使及司徒大使仍以中共願由政治解決爲其調解基礎，但以後終將了解，中共不過僅在時間而已。</p>
<p>延安四項議案</p>
<p>延安中央政局曾於三月二十日通過四項議案，內容充分表現並無意於和平談判。政府曾獲悉該四項議案之內容如下：（一）盡辦分化國民黨，使其中反動及前進份子互相攻擊，設法接近前進份子，並打擊反動份子；（二）清算國民黨特務份子及「CC」；（三）爭取美國同情，繼續與政府談判，但絕不使任何問題獲得解決。此足使中共獲得時間在其統治區內，充實軍事及政治力量，目前應以最磊努力佔領東北，並使平津兩地陷於孤立，以後再佔據整個華北；（四）以所有方法使美國與政府疏遠，俾美國不再在軍事及經濟援助政府。</p>
<p>以上即中共之政策，但以東北而言，中共業已失敗。本人與共產黨有十年接觸經騐，對之比中國任何人主識較清。</p>
<p>從不遵守協定</p>
<p>共產黨今日所承認之任何協議，即使有白紙黑字可憑，明日亦難望其遵守，其所發言論，殆等於零。彼等一切行爲，均爲完成一當前急要目的，故中共爲現實主義者。彼等自私·殘忍·不可靠·亦無愛國民。共產黨對予個人集中攻擊，稱本人爲「反動份子」，任何人反對共產黨，均被視爲反動份子。如君尙認爲共產黨有何道德，則難免走上歧途。本人曾屢次被共產黨欺騙，與工產黨所締一切協定，均無價值可言，彼等缺乏誠意，而誠意適爲任何協定之必具條件。中日戰爭前，本人曾代表政府與中共談判，提出最後解決之機會，不幸中共並未履行其二十六年九月之諾言，即「服從蔣主度命令，擁護三民主義，取銷中國境內之蘇維埃政府，及中共軍受國軍最高統帥指揮」。中共已入充其機會，本人之結論爲彼等不欲與國民黨合作。國民黨不欲徒事內戰，反之，中共欲用內戰方法，奪取政權，而又不負發動內戰之責任。本年一月十日停戰協定成立前中共所佔城市，不足七十處，目今已盤踞二百處以上，足證中共破壞停戰協定，縱使黑字落於白紙，仍屬一貫欺騙手段。</p>
<p>歷史可作證明</p>
<p>若將近代史作簡明之檢討，或能帮助世人更加明瞭中共。自二十四年至二十六年，本人因抗戰已不可免，曾殫精竭慮，研究國共妥協可能，俾兩黨能團結對抗共同敵人日本。中國固需何留每沒鮮血，供抗日之用，若果政府欲訴請武國，戰前即可輕易消滅中共，然政府決計保存國家實力，與日本一戰。政府鑒於日方威脅嚴重，亟欲容納中共，永久結束國共兩黨之歷來糾紛，遂發動與中共談判，進行頗久，至抗戰發動，本人即要求中共立刻宣佈其四點諾言，中共終於九月間宣佈之。政府雖未輕易消滅中共，反而復爲所紿，益中共並不履行其諾言也。</p>
<p>CC一詞來源</p>
<p>陳氏繼詊述過去二十三年間，（自民十二年起），中共欺騙國民黨之種種事實。佔領長江以南地區，共黨又恐國民黨完成北伐使命，再度自食其言，在漢口與江精衛合作，成立「政府」，「免」蔣主席總司令職。國民黨爲免革命工作，遭受威脅計，立即在南京成立政府，繼續北伐，並實行清黨，汪精衛見北伐順利，又呈機會主義故技，背棄共黨，並稱：當民國十八年間，新軍閥仍控制長江以北，國民黨遂在軍閥盤踞區內組織秘書團體，擬俟軍閥肅清後，即將秘密團體解散，其人員亦可公開爲國民黨黨員，此等秘密團體，名稱各異。渠所以提及此點者，乃欲說明「CC」一詞來源，實係共黨揑造陳果赍有一團體名中央俱樂部，實際上並無所謂中央俱樂部之才體存在，而本人與陳果夫亦從未組織所謂「CC」派，明瞭中國情形者，均知中國人從不以自己姓名爲任何團體之名稱。「CC」一詞，迅即湮沒無聞。直待至九一八事變，日人復提及此名詞，開始見諸日方報端，蓋日人深知中國抗日最激烈之團體爲國民黨，故用「CC」派一詞詬辱之。</p>
<p>已獲三項結論</p>
<p>最後，陳氏稱：本人已得三項結論：（一）共黨視每一個人爲工具，（二）共黨視每一行動爲手段；（三）共黨所發每一言語，祇是適應當時需要。如果共黨能改變其基本態度，和平解決，始有若十希望。自中日戰爭爆發以來，本人即未參加對共黨之政治爭鬥，因本人於二十一年十二月調任教育部長直至三十三年，始復出長組織部。</p>

<p>〔本報北平九日電〕軍調部第廿五小組，九日下午二時半出發安平鎭，調查七月二十九日美軍被襲事件，當日傍晚無結果返回北平。該小組係由共產黨人員九人，政府四人，美方三人組織，政府組長張叔衡，共產黨組長黃逸峯，美方組長台維斯。汽車出東直門後，即有九十二軍官兵隨同保護，共產黨代表黃逸峯曾提出抗議，政府代表張叔衡當示國軍不必跟同，張黃二人並相約，在國軍區域由政府代表領先，入「解放區」後，由共產黨代表汽車領先，車至安平鎭，並未遭遇共軍，即由曾目睹安平鎭被襲擊時之邁加爾少校當塲指明出事地點及被襲情形，香河縣長班長儒亦到塲，擬向小組報告事件經過，共產黨代表對此等報告堅持保留態度，認爲安平一帶旣爲國軍進駐，則一切人證物證皆已改變，不足作爲根據，三方爭持不決，僵坐於田野間良義，最後共產黨表示讓步，認爲可聽取當地縣長報告，但必須至「解放區」聽取共產黨軍政當局之報告，政府代表，强調欲明眞相，必須在肇事地點調查清楚。據美方延來作加爾少校，之邁曾遊西藏，彼證復引西藏爲例稱：西藏爭決爭端，皆在出事地點聚衆公斷，共產黨代表仍不贊成，三方代表遂復返北平。</p>
<p>〔本報北平九日電〕昨日一度出發安平鎭視察之軍調部第廿五小組，今日再度擱淺於「調查程序」之沙灘上。上午十時至十二時，小組曾舉行會議，美方延美海軍陸戰隊司令部代表報告安平事件情形，共產黨首提議，騐明其證明其海軍陸戰隊司令部代表之身份，經騐明無誤後，共產黨仍反對聽取該代表之報告，認爲「調查程序」必須先確立，始能進行聽取報告，至午無結果。下午二時半，再度開會討論，美方記者一人與政府記者二人（中央社與本報記者各一人）皆出席，共產黨代表黃逸峯曾以下列理由，反對記者參加：（一）記者參加應限於討論調查材料時，（二）共產黨記者尙未到，黃氏並繼續反對在「調查程序」確立前聽取海軍陸戰隊司令部代表報告，美共雙方激辯至三時，美代表戴維斯提議休會，請示饒伯森委員，黃亦請示葉劍英，至四時四十六分宣告復會，斯時共產黨已有一記者自張家口趕到，共產黨表示讓步，同意記者出席會議，但堅持共產黨所擬定之「調查程序」，其程序爲（一）聽取海軍陸戰隊司令部報告，（二）聽取共產黨地方軍政當局報告，（三）聽取政府地方軍事當局報告，（四）確定三方證人，聽取證人報告，（五）其他必要措施，（六）總結調查報告，報告三委員公布新聞，載維斯大致同意其所擬定程序，但認爲目前應即聽取美海軍陸戰隊司令部報告，而不應在計劃程序上延宕工作，最後仍未獲得協議，不歡而散。定十日晨九時再行討論。九日會議時，戴維斯以手扶其低垂之頭，似不勝其傷腦筋。又三委員會決定，由共產黨派一聯絡小組，與共產堂冀東軍區聯絡，俾作前往調查準備，惟九日下午尙未出發。</p>
<p>〔中央社北平九日電〕調查香河開卷有益軍被告襲擊事之軍調部廿五小組，因共產黨藉口程序問題，百般阻撓，致詰查無法時行，眞象無以太白，某觀察家對記者言，共黨此種措施之目的，不外兩端，其一爲企圖不了了之，延不進行，借以減少世人注意。其二或乃以延緩煩擾美方，迫使美方於不得已中逕自提出解決辦法，然後以之作爲宣傳口實，指摘美軍在華行動過於主觀，對未明眞象之事件，遽作主張。</p>

<p>— 本報駐京記者張明</p>
<p>你能相信嗎，上帝給我們爲生的水，如今竟成了暴虐者的武器了！蘇北大規模的決堤，却是爲共軍在蘇北軍事進攻失利後的洩忿，洪水排山倒海而來，千萬純良無辜的同胞，生命財產在這裏被呑噬了。</p>
<p>你能想像嗎，無數的人們，正棲息在僅露水面的屋脊上生活着，餐着風，宿着露，這是共軍的「德政」之怕賜！但是，共軍却說：「這是水漲泛濫所致」，然而「一切爲了人民」的「民主政府」，爲什麼視若無賭？無論如何，不能否認「民主政府」的共軍是「主」宰了人「民」的生命財產。</p>
<p>事實勝於雄辯，今天這一事實，終於在我們這一羣中外記者的眼前展開了</p>
<p>動機是這樣：六日的中宣部外記者招待會上，有人提出赴蘇北實地視察的要求，經中宣部的允許，派專機載送前往視察，於是九日晨，在勵志社集合了中外記者十五人，一路向飛機塲出發，他們所代表的單位，是：聯合社·合衆社·國際新聞社·紐約時報·紐約先鋒論壇報·路透社·印度自由通訊社·法國新聞社，還有國內報社上海申報·大公報·東南日報·中央社·南京中央日報·大剛報·新民晚報，另外還有國際宣傳處和中宣部國防部派來的人員，同機前往，擔任翻譯和說明。空軍第十二中隊也派了一位聯絡員鐘達，隨時指告地形，一共是二十個人，在上午十時登上了（C－51　1296）號機出發，由鄧從綬·張柏年任駕駛，周榮輝·熊科爲通訊員，這一趟行程，預計是四二零英里，由南京出發，經宿遷·窑灣，及徐州附近運河站之趙墩，再沿鐵路線經新安鎭，直飛東海·灌雲，並經准隊而返南京，所經之地，共有四個泛區：（一）趙墩，（二）新安鎭，（三）上坊街，（四）喬車鎭。</p>
<p>駕駛員始終保持着三千呎的高度，以免發生意外的事件。十時正登機，越十分鐘始昇空，氣溫也從炎熱轉爲涼爽，窗外白雲朵朵，掠過飛機兩翼，經竹保鎭，即達進眙，而入共軍地區，從這裏開始，我們就只見眼底盡是水，因爲洪澤湖水勢很大，沿湖低　，農田也被滲入了不少水，這時是十時卅七分，已臨湖面，過洪澤湖後，又發現地面不少深黑線條，配合在廣大的綠野平面上。據說，黑的是堤，綠的還是水，這是共軍特別控制的小河，以便引水到村落裏去。這時，我們已把飛機上的艙門取下，探員俯視，小部份人帶着望遠鏡瞭望。十時五十分，到仰北集，從這裏開始，決提的鏡頭，已歷歷在目，水光一片，只見綠色的樹根點綴其間，像黑天的星子一親。過了這塊泛區，仍然隨時可以發現不規則的水流，到處散佈田間。十一時十分，飛臨宿遷，水　增劇，機身降低，並沿勢圍繞一周，這個決口，共有八處，泛濫面積是十八平方里，也是最小的一處，就是窑灣。十一時廿分過窑灣，飛機指向趙墩，據國防部聯絡員的說明，這個決口長達一千四百呎，汜濫面積一百五十六平方公里，橋標是早被破壞冲毀，極目下視，只見水波與陽光回射，萬點閃爍。自然，這不是靜的水，水還在汹湧的激流着。據說，這個泛區在十天前來時還沒有發現水，一星期也只有少量的水，今天却郵到廣大區域的水了。</p>
<p>自十一時卅五分起，我們折向東行，開始沿隴海路飛。隴海路似乎是靜止着，車輛沒有動，原因是橋樑破壞了，路基被截成一段一段的。據說明的人指給我們看，說是幾乎截成千萬段了。</p>
<p>駕駛員始終保持着三千英呎的高度，爲的是避免沒有人敢保證的意外。</p>
<p>這里，繼續東飛，十一時五十分抵達東海上空，這裏有三十七處決口，汜濫面積是二百零二平方公里，飛機從它的周圍經過，我們都想從水中尋覓片點陸地了，可是水，水，水，你閉上眼還是水，到處是斷了弦似的決口，汹水勢，在湍急的流着，我們打不到村落，廬舍的影子，沒有見一個人，見一條船，我們不能想像是到那裏去了。在偶然見的「綠洲」上，可以見到地面正曝晒着金黃色的東西，原來這就是他們的食糧——玉蜀黍樹頂，屋脊成了棋盤中星落的棋子，在水中間偶然露出一些。在機上瞭望下去，已經是沒有變化的，全部大水了。這時是十二時卅五分，於是我們再折向南冰，到灌雲汜區，這裏決口達一百二十二處，汜濫面積是一百平方公里，眼簾下又是多少的生靈被他吞噬了呀！</p>
<p>圍繞泛區後，方向指向西南，開始回程之途，慢慢的我們見到了可愛的陸地，田疇萬頃，心情爲之輕鬆。這時，我們經過蘇北共軍的總樞紐淮陰，但是被陣陣的雲遮阻我們，沒有見到什麼，那時是十二時五十分。</p>
<p>我們的行程自一時起開始返京，外記者們，首先倒在機腹裏睡眠了，機身也不平靜的顚擺起來。我們在飢腸轆轆中，返抵明故宮機塲，時間正是一時五十分，帶回了千萬個「慘」字，這是人類的所爲嗎？我們不能相信！（八月九日自南京發）</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕賴伽第亞於聯總大會中主張於十月十日左右結束聯總活動，並解除其自身職務後，行總署長蔣廷黻氏昨已正式表示反對。蔣氏聲稱：遠東與歐洲之善後救濟事業，目前尙未完成。如聯總結束，則必需另立一國際性之機構，處理此項問題，而另設機構，則又需相當時間。聯總工作未竟，中途結束，引起之困難必多。蔣氏主張各國應使聯總繼續其工作，於一年以後，始行結束，俾能完成聯總成立時所欲達到之最低限度之目的。</p>

<p>〔法國新聞社南京八日電〕天主敎神甫某，最近自冀魯豫中共邊區逃亡來此，據其發表談話稱：山東兗州及曹州敎區天主敎神甫百人以上，包括加拿大，比利時，波未，南斯拉夫及匈牙利各國國籍神甫在内，現處於危險境地。曹州中共當局於本年七月十五日將六十八歲之胡華茲大主敎（殆係荷蘭籍）逮捕，同時被捕者尙有德籍神甫及女修道士十人，敎會所設立之醫院，設備爲全城之冠，已被封閉，院內病人亦被驅出。據中共地方當局稱：此次捕人係居民告發所致，自七月十五至廿二日間，城中時有羣眾集會，有時每次多至三千八，由市當局告以「你們是落伍份子，你們想喝外國人的水。」因此輩人民拒絕控訴天主敎後，當局乃加以曉諭，商界及民間代表曾數度籲請釋放被拘者，但未獲准。被拘者於七月廿五日一度受審，但直至廿八日仍留獄中，並未宣判。被拘者於七月廿二日及廿三日每日兩次游街示衆，直達敎堂，敎堂外面置有木牌，上書「此乃罪犯所在」，敎堂之聖骨聖均被曝露。胡華茲大主敎因年邁體衰，數度暈倒，民衆目擊可憐情狀，但無法加以援手。按該區天主敎會之情形，已報告敎廷代表蔡寗大主敎，敎廷當局亦已接到報告，首都美國大使館對此亦已注意，此事殆將呈報馬歇爾特使，請求轉向中共質問。但據馬使左右人士稱，彼等並未接獲此項報告。</p>

<p>據聯合社日内瓦七日電稱：聯合國善後救濟總署署長賴伽第亞將於十月間來華，視察究竟，聯總工作東方部份則將於明年三月三十一日結束。惟據行總蔣署長所稱，謂聯總結束日期在本年年底，行總本定於明年三月底結束，但以我國幅員遼闊，運輸困難，故我國希望能將行總工作時間延至明年九月三十日，因在中國「時間」即「物資」。</p>
<p>我們很同情蔣署長「時間即物資」的看法，自然更贊成行總工作時限的延長。但是，我們同時不能不深刻檢討以往的善後救濟工作究竟怎樣，否則時間儘管延長，工作仍無效率，豈不更加慚愧？「行總」成立一年以來，其工作情况如何，久爲國人所關懷。願乘此聯總署長行將來華視察究竟之前，及聯總遠東區代表特別會議今日在滬舉行之際，作一番簡略的檢討。</p>
<p>首先我們要提出的，就是「聯總」解除中止物資運華的禁令，應該趕快頒發。中止物資運華禁令的頒發，似乎事先未曾經過縝密的考慮，實在是一件遺憾的事。現在聯總署長旣說明此事全爲六月份中國港口船舶擁擠之故，預料九月份情形將大見改善，則目前己屆八月中旬，爲什麼還不取消不甚合理的禁令？至若一個地方辦事處的一部分職員，公然發表書函，指摘其駐在國的善後救濟機構，不特足以表示「聯總」職員漫無紀律，抑亦足以表示「聯總」本身組織也有缺憾。我們不能單獨來責備行總的。</p>
<p>講到「行總」，我們應該有一種認識，就是它的工作是艱巨的，受了客觀條件的種種限制，它的工作也一定不能處處令人滿意。運輸工具的缺乏，地方的不靖，政府各部門間的合作未能如理想的預期，凡此種種，都使它的工作不能達到它的理想。「行總」活動範圍的龐大，加以上述的種種困難，更使「行總」的工作受到層層的障碍。據蔣署長廷黻的表示，「行總」現在經手的物資數量，相當於我國戰前每年輸入商品的總和之三倍，其價値相等於我國戰前全部國家預算的兩倍。因其活動範圍如此龐大，而又事屬草創，所以「行總」的活動，未能盡如人意，自然是一件可以原諒的事。但我們所不解的是：（一）在出售救濟物資方面，「行總」所採取的倒底是什麼政策？（二）「行總」旣爲行政院的一部門，何以「行總」的體制，可以自外於一般的政府體制？</p>
<p>關於第一點，即在出售救濟物資方面，我們曉得在「行總」掌握下的物資數量，極爲龐大。一部分救濟物資原經「聯總」同意可以出售，即以其所得，經營善後救濟業務——據說，是以所得維持機構的經費。但對於是項救濟物資的出售，其目的完全是在收入呢，還是於收入外另具穩定國內物價的作用？如果是前者，則善後救濟，徒具虛名，論其實際，豈非跡近一種大規模的托辣斯，以特惠條件，專營輸入貿易？此其結果，徒使幾瀕崩潰了的民族經濟加重其危難，似乎有失善後救濟的本意。現在「行總」所掌握的棉花，可以供應全國的紗廠，我們不明白何以「行總」旣將此項棉花供應公私紗廠，而竟不能收平抑紗價的實效？據蔣署長表示，抑平紗價之權不操在「行總」之手，此容有部分眞理，但我們所不解的，何以「行總」掌握有這樣多的巨量物資而不能爲平抑物價的努力，反依然坐視紗價的上騰？一切的跡象似乎在指出一宗事實，即「行總」祇爲增益收入，不但未作抑平物價的努力，且因其拋售物資，難免有助長物價上漲之嫌。在出售救濟物資的處理方面，我們要問「行總」的政策究竟在那裏？</p>
<p>據蔣署長前在立法院會質詢席上的表示：「行總」爲防止舞弊，於一般的公務員待遇外，「行總」職員有百分之五十的福利金，是則爲一般公務員所無。我們不明白的是：如果「行總」是政府的一部，則其職員自應與一般公務員無殊，是項特殊待遇的規定，顯屬有意破壞一般公務員的體制，於一般公務員體制外，別成一體制，是即無異破壞國家行政的統一，制度的統一。如果爲防止舞弊，我們要問加了百分之五十的福利金，「行總」是否能够做到弊絕風清？再則「行總」固然要防止舞弊，難道別個機關都不應防止舞弊？試問別個機關是否有百分之五十的福利金？外面有人故意說，救濟總署不如稱爲「救濟本署」，我們希望行總要用事實來刷清這種污辱。</p>
<p>我們了解「行總」工作的艱巨，但我們不能容許因爲工作的艱巨而破壞國家行政制度的統一，更不能容許在處理出售救濟物資上的漫無政策，反而促使少數人發財，多數人吃苦。我們希望政府能够注意到此項要政的推行，實與民生經濟的榮枯及民族復興，休戚相關，因而能爲必要的改進。</p>

<p>（續昨）社論敎授白琅特，會在東京住過三年，他的談鋒甚健，對於中國學生，名字記得很熟。他經常替學生修改社論，雖然右手已經患了瘋濕病，但坐在打字機旁工作，還是十分起勁。夏潑先生幾乎一生盡　於新聞學院，他是報紙的總編輯，他帶領學生們出外練習採訪，回來整理新聞，再替學生修改標題，他是哥侖比亞小城裏，最够聲望的人物，居民們不僅認識他，而且敬仰他。</p>
<p>哥倫比亞城地方太小，總共不過一萬八千居民，兩條大街，幾條小街，如此而已。學生們最感覺苦痛的，大概是採訪課了。每天要採訪消息，沒有消息，無法交卷，因此某家產一男，某家死一女，都成爲他們採訪的對象。我們一行四個人，從聖路易到達哥侖比亞，立刻或爲新聞的對象，第二天便刊出在「米蘇里人報。」新聞學院的員書館藏書甚多，也有中國的中央日報·大公報·申報·新聞報。他們保存有全份的紐約時報，而且編有極詳細的「索引」。美國女學生在米蘇里新聞學院的甚多，大部份都學廣告，原因是學廣告可以多賺錢。中國學生現在有謝然之·張學遂·武希轅·曾美霞及陳某諸人，最近某次獎金論文比賽，謝然之兄（前曾任國內新湖北日報社長）榮獲全院第二名。可惜的是，我沒有時間參觀</p>
<p>米蘇里農學院，中國學生在米蘇里學農的有好幾位，學經濟的有兩位。我們到達的第二天，全體中國學生請我們在一家餐館午餐。在這個恬靜僻小的城市裏，十多個人集會，似乎是一件大事了。車子離開哥侖比亞小城，是第二天下午的事，臨別之時，我望見米蘇里大學的六個石柱，有說不出的依戀。那六議石柱聳立在米蘇里大學的總辦公室面前，據說，是很早以前某次大火的遺跡·現在，大學當局特地出版了一本小册子，爲六根石柱「考古」。我沒有去哥侖比亞城的兩座女子學院參觀，（基督女子學院，和斯蒂芬女子學院）都是米蘇里州的著名學府。另外一座威斯敏斯脫學院，在哥侖比亞東南的福爾敦城，那是邱吉爾當年演講英美合作聯合反蘇的地方·據說那天演講的情形，確乎非常生動和激烈。杜魯門總統陪着邱吉爾坐汽車到福爾敦，走在福爾敦街上，許多杜魯阿當年老朋友，伸着粗手大脚喊：「哈雷！哈雷！」</p>
<p>杜魯門總統老是面帶笑容，邊走邊揮着帽子，他應接不暇的招呼着他的田間老朋友：「哈　！詹姆士」，「哈囉！莊尼」，「哈　！湯姆」！一路哈　聲不停·民主國家的總統，本來就可愛，出身田園的總統，一朝回到田間，更變得可愛，杜魯門的家，在米蘇里州的獨立城，在米蘇里州的西端，靠近肯撤斯城的旁邊。獨立城還不能算杜魯門的眞正故鄕，他的出生之地在格林威爾村莊，距肯撤斯城十三哩。杜魯門幼年，在格林威爾耕田，所以有的米蘇里人，至今仍解他爲「放牛童」，那是杜魯門幼年的事，後來脫離農作，到肯撤斯城任店員職，纔搬到獨立城居住。我們在沒有進入肯撒斯以以前，先去獨立城繞了一個圈子，那是離哥侖比亞城一百多哩之處。在汽車加油站上，沈作乾副領事詢問站伕，關於杜魯門的故居住址，加油的站夫，一副瀟洒的樣子說：「這不是他的家，他母親住的」·汽車兜在獨立城的小街小巷上，繞了很多灣，最後終於</p>
<p>找到了達拉華街的一座白色木板屋。屋前草坪上堅著美國國旗，有秘密警察模樣的人，在徘徊看守。獨立城的人都知道總統的這座小屋，屋前一座洋樓是縣立高級中學，屋後一座洋樓是初級中學。我們沒有在獨立城作多久的逗留，當天傍晚，便進入了肯撤斯城，僑領蔡翊吾先生，替我們訂了菲列普旅館的房間。肯撤斯城是美國陸地的中心，是美國中部的一座大城，名雖爲肯撤斯，但城的大部份仍屬於米蘇里州，小部份麗肯撤斯州。兩州以米蘇里河爲界，河東的居民有四十萬人，河西的居民僅十二萬，河東是商業繁盛區，河西是工廠區。全部合起來，還沒有聖路易的規模，但街道乾凈，樓屋新穎，給人有一種新鮮的感覺。</p>
<p>肯撤斯氣候特別好，雖然是盛夏，但並不像紐約的悶熱，也不像芝加哥的熱得滿身發粘。杜魯門中在沒有當聯邦參議員以前，在肯撤斯城當過法官。當年的市長，民主黨的「巨頭」之一潘達貢斯，是賞識杜魯門已經成了白宫的主人，潘達貢斯因爲保辦烟賭，貪贓枉法，被人告發，瑯璞入獄，終於　　死去。肯撤斯人都知道這些故事，一位同旅館的人，指着旅館旁邊一家「克拉克」帽子店告訴我：「請看，這就是當年杜魯門當過　計的店鋪。每天早上七點半鐘，杜魯門從家裏出來，安步當車，步進這一家兩層樓的帽莊」。這還是不多久以前的事，僅僅不多久的時間，桑田變成了滄海，滄海變成了桑田！（七月十三日，肯撤斯城）—完！</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕本市捲烟工業勞資雙方鑒於外烟暢銷以後，國產紙烟危機日迫，特於昨日午後三時假康樂酒家舉行聯歡會。資方參加者有五十餘家廠商代表七十餘人，勞方到各廠區工會代表三百餘人，並有各報記者三十餘人應邀列席。吳國楨市長，社會部組訓司長陸京士，市黨部執委王先靑·謝大荒·周裴成，中華勞動協會理事長朱學範，總工會理事長陸克明等，亦俱蒞會。全場空氣歡洽熱烈。</p>
<p>聯歡會於三時許開始，由周學湘·戴耕莘（華成烟公司董事長），潘銘新（南洋烟公司總經理）任主席團。首由周學湘報告聯歡會意義，略謂：「其主要目的在於促進勞資合作，挽救捲烟業之危險。喚起捲烟業勞資雙方對此一危機之　覺。當前廠方不能賺錢，而工人生活不能改善，其　結並不在工資問題，實在於外貨香烟之暢銷，我們的生產不能和他們競爭，成本比他們高。若長此以往，捲烟工業將有不能存在之危險。故今日勞資雙方應站在同一陣綫上，努力合作生產。同時希望政府能限制洋烟進口，提高國貨捲烟品質，以　對抗。」周氏末後並稱：「粵烟廠已因外烟暢銷而紛紛停業，若上海同業不能振作，恐亦將遭此覆轍」。戴耕莘潘銘新亦先後致詞，俱希望勞資雙方能本此聯歡會之融治精神，努力合作。</p>
<p>呉市長致詞</p>
<p>大會旋即請吳市長致訓詞，市長於熱烈掌聲中謂：今日向在座之同胞發言，而非單獨向勞方或資方說話，表示其心境極爲興奮而愉快。繼即舉例說明外國工業界勞資融洽之情形稱：「美國漢賽巧克力公司老　並無家室，亦無私慾，所有盈利完全化在改進勞工福利上。日本當此戰敗之後，麥克阿瑟曾允許日本工人得能提高工資，而工會代表答以能與戰前工資相同，即於願已足，不欲再有增加，蓋其深明今日生產之工具與原料兩皆困難，若再提高工資，將不能與銷售國内外之外貨競爭也。故而今日我國勞資雙方之態度，實有改進之必要。」市長織再縷述勞資所應改進之點，渠稱：「先說資方，資方以前對勞方多不當同胞看待，今日捲烟業能勞資共同密切聯繫，舉行此一融洽的聯歡會，打破從前的隔膜，實堪謂美，此其一。以前資方賬目向來不公開，對政府對勞方俱嚴守秘密，此係不必要的能度，資方以資本謀相當利盈，何用隱瞞，此其二。人事管理亦應改進，用人應科學化，此其三。再說勞方，對勞方亦有一點意見。工廠若關門，工人亦即失業，故工人與廠方營業休戚相關，美國烟爲何價廉，因其工資低，工作效率高，而中國工人之效率不能若美國之高，工資反較美國爲貴，故中國工人之效率實應提高，無論在何崗位，均先當反省自身。當此空前危機，資方應思如何方能科學化，勞方則常思如何增進其工作之效率，若互相推諉，則工廠勢必馬上關門，工人隨即失業。」</p>

<p>螺旋槳的噪音急促得像要炸裂，我的心也似揉壓得緊緊的，透不過氣來。</p>
<p>總飛機師陳文惠與副飛機師吉美再一次的檢視過複雜的儀器，交換了一個無聲的O.K.陳便把操縱盤向前輕推，我感覺到微徽的顚動，「黄褐色的跳板」在加速的往後退去——我們起飛了。</p>
<p>我急忙看錶，時間是十一時廿五分。再回顧左首窗外·機庫，飛機，又是機庫，又是飛機……都如飛一般的向後過去。沒有我思量的時刻，地面也在望下沉，沉，沉。樹，房屋，廟宇，河道，河裏的船隻，全在一點一點縮小。</p>
<p>每次我的心微微一宕，便直覺到機身向上一浮。我的兩眼注視着高度計，看着長針從三至四至五百呎。我們已在浦東上空。</p>
<p>這時陳將操縱盤微微旋轉，他的右脚輕蹴着右Pedal，翼下方的地平線便向右傾斜，我意識到飛機在向左轉　，朝着上海市區飛去。</p>
<p>從南到北的黃浦，重復出現的時候，大約在十一時卅五分左右。這條大江，望下去像條蜿蜓着的泥溝，停泊江上的三三兩兩的貨輪，運油輪，帆船僅像些按着實際尺寸縮製的模型。僅只五分鐘，我已望得見外灘那些積木似的高樓：江海關頂上的大鐘，方頂潔白得耀眼的中央銀行大廈，全在左邊機　的下方掠過。渺小，渺小，往日我走過它底下，它傲岸地俯視着我，今日它只是像座孩子們玩的積木，消逝在我脚下。</p>
<p>我的緊張的心弦，這時早已鬆弛。在五十餘呎長的鐵腹中，來回向外張望，像孩子般的歡悅。這空中是多麼的凉爽輕鬆。飛翔在天空裏正是一稱自由，是如此的安寗，平穩·我暫時忙却了地面上的窒息，煩　。</p>
<p>卅八號機固定在六百五十呎高度上，平穩地循着灰色帶一股華德路，向右傾側作一百八十度轉向，掠過黃浦江，再向浦東飛去·從浦東　着圈兒過來，我們又一次的在外　上空飛過，以便　顧君的鏡頭有充裕的時間攝下上海的島　。</p>
<p>在歸航中，陳文惠總飛機師不斷把駕駛盤後扳，飛機就接連着升高，上升到一千呎。速度計上是「時速一百六十哩」。但我却得不到一點兒速度的感覺。過了霞飛路，油門關低，高度迅速在下降。當降落到二三百呎時，那條黄褐色的滑走道又出現在機前方。我立即又回復了那種稍稍引起一些量眩的速度的感覺。高度計的指針在急速地退回零點，在不知不覺中，降落輪巳抵止了地面。</p>

<h3 id="c118">拆息太重開支太大　高利貸亦無法支持　典當業尚存七百六十家 <a href="#c118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕典當原爲調劑平民金融機構之一，故凡百業務設施，終求以符合民生福利爲原則。奈戰後隨百物騰漲，一般典當之業務，亦隨以急遽變化。當期則日形縮短，當息則日見增高。在敵僞盤踞期間情况且愈演愈烈。變相之非法小型押當，更風起　湧。當期縮短至一月，當息居然高至五角以上。勝利後，本市典押兩業負賣方面，奉令成立整理委員會。積極籌備，終於本年三月五日，正式成立典當商業同業公會。該會成立後，典當押當兩業，已合而爲一。</p>
<p>兩月爲滿期　首月四角六</p>
<p>月前同業規定，當期一律二月爲滿寛放五日，當息每元計月息二角七分，棧租四分，手續費一角五分，合共爲四角六分。惟手續費一項僅限於第一月收取一次，以後不計，故第二月合共爲三角一分。二月平均，每元每月之利息費用，約爲四角弱。</p>
<p>際茲高利貸盛行之秋，有謂按目前典當業取息之標準而言，實亦高利貸之一種，而有加取締之必要。記者特以此事詢諸社會局主管處，據告：社會局對目前典當業取息辦法，早加關注。該處以職掌所及，當望該業對目前取息標準，有所調整。茲此事在該業方面，亦自感有其必要。並願將每元月息减低爲二角五分，棧租四分照舊，手續費改爲每月七分。據該負資人稱：手續費一項，該業業規本無明文規定，本應加以取締。惟以一般典當從業人員，成恃手續費爲月入之重要待遇，故爲顧全典當職工生活計，仍予保留。</p>
<p>保留手續費　減至三角六</p>
<p>經此番調整後，每元每月之利息費用，已减低爲三角六分。現正由該業公會草擬呈文，呈請調整，最近即可望批准施行。又據該負責人推算，戰前一般銀行放款利息，不過七八厘，而是時典當利息費用，合共爲二分有零。較銀行定期利息，約高百分之一百三十至五十。茲者一般放款利息，已達一角五六分。而此番典當業願將利息費用，减低至三角六分，依銀行放款利息遞增之比例言，此項當息遞减，尙稱合理。此後社會局將斟酌實際情形，逐步使當息抑低，以維平民生計云。</p>
<p>記者旋分訪若干典當業中人，叩詢該業近况。據悉：典當業自戰興以來，迭受幣制變更，物價暴漲，及暗息高翔之打擎。幣制變更一次，典當業之資本，即無形貶縮一次。戰前以一萬元小本經營之押當，已頗能應付裕如·今經八年抗戰，兩次幣制更易，此一萬元之資本，殆已化爲烏有。再加以物價一再騰踊，以解買力日趨萎縮之有限資本，當取價資日漲夜高之貨物，何啻腹背受創。</p>
<p>資本太薄弱　同業皆改行</p>
<p>在物價騰漲時期，往往在當客　物之時，與數月後備款贖貨之時，物似已騰漲數倍。故即以五角之高利息計，又何足補幣値貶跌於萬一。職是之故，年來一般正常之典當業，保持原有資本，已感無法，　談利潤。再按一般典當業情形而首，「架本」中（即當出款項之總額）之大部，尙係向親友或各商號拆借而來。而該項借人款之計息，又多在二角以上。故借人款之利息，成本已重，再加營業本身所需之一應支出，當息遂亦無法低康。時至今日，全市七百六十家典當同業，十九均屬外行人士投資經營。而原營此業者因受上述種種原因之有　，則多巳淘汰殆盡。以目前之數百家同業而首，資本以在百萬元以下者，佔絕大多數元。然架本相差懸殊，少僅數十萬，多則達二千萬元以上。惟架本天者，究屬鳳毛麟角。</p>
<p>日僅一二票　已味同難助</p>
<p>按目前門市狀況言，典當同業日當一二票者，比比皆是。甚至株守終日，而無一票上門。而一方面借入款之利息，及一應營業開支，仍須照支。故業中人咸稱：現階段之典當業，已形同雞肋。唯一希望，即望營業能再見起色，則尚堪維持。否則典當業前途，殆亦將一籌莫展云。</p>

<p>當你抽着一枝美國烟的時候，你可知道它的成本麼？告訴你，每包二十枝裝的馬立斯，烟商從美國定貨成本是美金七分，假定匯率二千五百元，成本只有一百七十五元，而付給海關的進口稅却要進價的百分之二百五十。</p>
<p>那就是四百卅七元五角，</p>
<p>國貨烟有一筆出廠稅，稅率爲百分之一百。啤酒也有一筆出廠稅，是百分之二百·土酒同。這當然是烟酒的一點限制，或者也可以說是寓禁於征之意。但是其他各業，也往往須付出一大筆捐稅，譬如以上海酒菜業而論，他們從設店開業起，所擔負各種捐稅義務名目如下：</p>
<p>營業牌照稅（是分等抽稅的）</p>
<p>營業稅（千分之十五）</p>
<p>所得稅（千分之三）</p>
<p>過分利得稅</p>
<p>筵席稅（一百二十分之二十）</p>
<p>其中以筵席捐爲最浩大，設有音樂舞池的還得按舞塲咖啡館計算，稅率是一百三十分之三十·你若飲一瓶啤酒或吃一杯冰淇淋，這上面還加着酒稅或冷飲執照捐。本市小麵飯館有四百家是准免筵席捐的，其餘五百餘家酒菜業公會會員，則俱是捐稅的對象，即使是專賣客飯菜飯的一帮，也無法除外·（因爲他們有時也帶費冷盆熱炒，這些，說是有錢人吃的，應當納稅·）</p>
<p>別小　了這小小筵席稅，市府最大宗財政收入，却靠着它，七月份收入者，據發表達十五億元之鉅。佔市政收入第一位·全市娛樂稅是第二個大數字，逾十三億元·它是附在電影·話劇·平劇等票價上帶收的，稅率從前是票價的百分之五十，八月份（也僅只有八月份）减爲百分之四十·因此當你買了一張一千五百元的戲劵走進影院時，你大可以心安理得，因爲其中三分之一，巳代你向市府盡了小市民的責任了。</p>

<h3 id="c133">揚泰綫上　蘇北行之二 <a href="#c133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>— 本報四日揚州訊　特派員杭舟</p>
<p>古揚州豪華的影子在無情的年代中消逝了；現在的它，是一個軍事的城市</p>
<p>城門口堡壘高築，守衛的士兵　機槍正觀前方，不　一　。行人來往，必須接受嚴密的檢查。</p>
<p>共軍在蘇北採取攻勢，揚州在它的虎視耽耽之中。善良的居民把他們的一切交付給保衛他們的國軍。他們信賴國軍的力量，服從軍事的管理，這城市便在緊張中獲得了安定。</p>
<p>可是，安定不能掩飾着蕭條和凄凉。記者所住的一家旅館，有三百多間房間，現在只住三個人。商店的門都開着，陳列的貨物亦不少，但只見夥計在櫃台裏打　　。人不見减少，反有增多；增多的是衣衫襤褸被「鬥爭」出來的難民，使揚州倍增凄凉。</p>
<p>難民的總數據調查有四萬。這些人代替了往日高貴的遊客。社會部在這兒辦了廿十二個招待所施行救濟，使他們不至於餓死。我去參觀過幾個招待所，發覺一個未曾發覺的事實：在蘇北的所謂「解放區」，被共黨鬥爭出來的難民，以往都是比較有財產的人，現在則是貧窮的農工——那些共黨自豪的「羣衆」——亦一起流亡了。</p>
<h3 id="c134">三擔米收成　被徵去二擔半 <a href="#c134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>一個卅九歲的貧農忿忿地說：</p>
<p>「他們方給我三畝半田，我想可以好好地過生活了；誰知道三擔米的收成，他們倒要徵去兩擔半，這叫我怎麼過？」</p>
<p>共黨革命手段是暴力的。它根本否定了固有的一切，希圖一下子把中國變一個顏色。在這點上它註定了失敗。所謂「解放區」的人民，現在如同吊在半空之中：舊有的一切，連中國人民最講究的那是宗法關係，都發摧毀無遺；而新的，他們只見到一種如洪水猛獸似的吞蝕，要把他們整個的人性，吞沒在黨的無窮的慾念中。無知的農工們漸漸地懂得了；於是，他們亦流亡了。</p>
<p>那位中年的農民還告訴我一件事實——</p>
<p>一個政府方面的人，被共軍捉住了，被稱為「國特」，或「頑固份子」，要處以極刑。這刑罰有個奇特的名字叫「放砲」。這是一種比抗戰中日軍所施的暴行更慘酷的暴行。</p>
<p>在一塊空地上，共軍命令那人挖一個泥坑跳下去。然後，共軍上來兩個人把泥土堆回泥坑。堆到那人膝部的時候，上半身已發紫；堆到胸部，臉色全黑了；再堆上去，只聽得轟的一聲，那人頭的天靈蓋直向天冲，血如火山爆發般噴射達兩丈多高。——天！這就是「放砲」！</p>
<p>難民給揚州的刺激是很大的。這所反映的是黨政商民和軍隊的密切合作。</p>
<h3 id="c135">情勢在好轉　左右兩臂獲伸展 <a href="#c135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>另一方面的表現則是苦悶。揚州富紳的田產大半是包括在「鹽」上面的，現在生意不好做，無聊中，每天坐茶館的盡夜不絕。「富春」和「頤園」是出名的兩家，亦即是上等人的會聚之所。茶客們細細地品茶，輕輕地搖扇，慢慢地嚼食，吐出一句心事，「下個月的情勢會好一點了吧！」</p>
<p>情勢的確在好轉。國軍開始反擊後，揚泰，揚天兩路先後打通了。左右兩臂獲得了伸展，可以稍稍透一口氣。現在人們注意的是正面，尤其是邵伯和高郵。</p>
<p>這一口氣離開恢復繁榮還遠得很呢。一百多個妓女點綴着這荒寞的城市，生意清淡得可憐。香艶的故事是屬於久遠的了！如今，瘦西湖畔夕陽伴孤塔，小金山裏老僧數飛螢，我立在五亭橋上為揚州喚一聲：「還我青春」！</p>
<h3 id="c136">泰興和泰縣　堪稱一對難兄弟 <a href="#c136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>兩泰是一對難兄弟。</p>
<p>我從揚州去泰興的時候，揚泰路才收復，還不能通車，走的是口岸那條路。同行的有江蘇省政府民政廳長王公璵氏。</p>
<p>先到鎮江。口岸班輪船下午二時半才啓碇。此日長江風浪甚大，幸遇是順風又順水。到口岸換搭汽車抵泰興，天還沒有黑。</p>
<p>泰興才經過一次大戰，戰爭的痕跡，戰爭的氣味，我在距離它一段路時，已經看到嗅到。東西南北四個門，只開西門，守衛比揚州更嚴密。士兵喝令我們的車子停駛，一位班長走了過來。</p>
<h3 id="c137">刼後的災黎　渴待政府的撫慰 <a href="#c137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>「你們是那兒的」？</p>
<p>我們告訴了他。</p>
<p>「上面有命令：不管什麽人，不得允許不准進城！」他嚴肅地說；隨後，他溫和地表示去請示一下團長。</p>
<p>一會兒團部的政治指導員和縣長·黨部書記長等長長一列人走出城來歡迎王　長，記者亦叨了光。城裏只有稀稀落落的居民。但很快，國旗已經滿街掛起來了，還有人放爆竹，這表示刼後的災黎是如何期望政府的撫慰。</p>
<p>我們被接待在尚未開張的縣銀行裏，大概是這兒唯一的比較完整的所在了，但那是多麽地寒傖啊！我說這句放沒有一點輕蔑的意思，相反，我是含着敬意；我知道他們—在這城市裏工作的一切人—都在苦幹着。</p>
<p>守城的英雄劉光宇團長，我們正要去拜訪他，他却先來了。軍便服包着一個結實的身體，未講話先興奮地笑了。談起戰役的經過，津津有味，滔滔不絕，手舞足蹈，依稀是指揮作戰時的神情。</p>
<p>關於泰興大戰，我已報道過了，這裏只寫視察的經過。</p>
<p>第二天，我在全城作了個巡禮。這不像個城市，荒凉的程度，恰似山中的村落。沒有幾家像樣的商店，食品店只出賣些油條大餅。</p>
<p>城門外破壞更烈，觸目皆是斷垣殘壁。一條城河，還可嗅到血腥氣。</p>
<p>救濟工作，千頭萬緒，我替社會部着急。杯水車薪，濟什麽事！</p>
<h3 id="c138">李天霞師長　有美國將軍作風 <a href="#c138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>隨後，我們去泰縣。</p>
<p>泰縣，八十三師的李天霞師長坐鉅着。這是位活潑豪爽的軍人，帶兵很有些美國作風，軍中有各種娛樂，士兵得到充分的精神生活，顯出一片朝氣。打起仗來，够勁道。</p>
<p>由於李師長的活潑，泰縣城連帶活潑起來，戰訊跟着活潑走，曲塘克復後會師海安進取東台，李師長表示要與民同樂一番，可惜我已離開泰縣，不能參加盛會。泰縣的縣長丁作彬，人們稱他做「模範縣長」。的確的，蘇北的我所見到的幾個縣長！揚州的張濟傳，泰興的薛佩琦，和泰縣的丁作彬，都够得上稱一聲好縣長。他們還沒到「作壞」的時候，一切安定地方最重要。共軍的民兵隨時隨地破壞騷擾，最使他們頭痛。王公璵氏曾有感觸地說：「我一定要設法增强地方的武力，至少要做到以我們的方武地力去應付共軍的地方武力！」</p>
<h3 id="c139">寶島　台灣 <a href="#c139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>— 本報四日台灣航訊　特派員江暮雲</p>
<p>在台北車站旁一個吃「定食」的食堂裏，記者碰到了一位飛越台灣溝的首都客，他驀然問起：台灣的情形究竟怎樣，上海報紙罵得很利害！」當時記者就從容地回答他：「台灣有可愛的地方，也有可憎的地方！住居久了，纔可能有所理解」。</p>
<p>過渡期：</p>
<p>必有過渡現象</p>
<p>當我和他分手以後，我想起台灣雖然光復了將近一年，國內外的人對於這塊新生土地固然沒有認識清楚，即在現地參加實際工作的和大部份台灣人，認識清楚的怕也不能佔有太多的數目，這不是遺憾，人們說是過渡時期的過渡現象。</p>
<p>台灣這海島，當葡萄牙人登陸時，目覩山川風物的美麗，即呼之為「花麻蕯」（Formosa），外人沿稱為「美麗島」，五十一年前『馬關和約』訂立時，中國把它捧送給日本。日本沒有亞熱帶土地，又有南進的企圖，便將台灣作為基地，也作為它大後方的補給地，對台灣盡其壓榨的能事，工商業和物產，在殖民地經濟政策之下，盡量補給日本，日本取之不竭，用之不盡，於是頌之為「寶島」，「倉庫」，「寶庫」，這些字眼實含有濃重的壓榨意味！</p>
<p>發展到：</p>
<p>飽和點的台島</p>
<p>台灣沒有可以視為「寶」的，如果一定要指出「寶」來，我們只可以指出若干特產：米·蔗糖·茶·香蕉·鳳梨·森林和其他。米產量年約八九百萬石，每年輸出約四百萬石，都供給日本，今後可以補閩粵民食的不足。但要注意的是全省耕地，已給日本人發展到百分之二二·二，純與江南一帶相同的集約農田，田面已不能再行擴展，更需要肥料和勞力，蔗糖的種植，部份的已改種稻田，米產量當不致減少；目前糖產雖大減，雖望將來在世界市場上占到地位，但中國四萬萬五千萬人的食糖，也可以不仰求於外國。茶，現在也不能恢復原先的產量，而海外市場也遭遇到成本高的危機，不過它需要和全國的茶業通盤籌劃的。其他水菓等亞熱帶的作物，在中國的廣大地區裏，和閩粵亞熱帶農業區具有同一特質，不能作為台灣的「寶」。而因為台灣是第三紀層的水成岩，只有東北部間有火山岩的分怖，地下資源並不豐富，尤其是鐵，就沒有出產，日本人雖然開始着手創辦機械和化學工業，但不是粗製品仰賴日本，則其製成品仍供給日本，任何一部門的生產過程是不完全的，若干更完全為了應付戰時的需要！所以台灣並沒有「寶」的，它和閩粵比優的方面，是有日本的建設基礎，可是它已臨到發展的飽和點，而沒有廣東海南島前途希望之大。</p>
<p>維繫着：</p>
<p>六百萬的民心</p>
<p>台灣現有六百三十萬人口，除了十三萬系自馬來亞的蕃族以外，大部是來自泉州漳州，小部來自客家廣東各地，明末初期來的是海盜，第二期是反滿清的遺民，隨鄭成功而來，多數是商人，官吏，幕僚等亡命之徒，許地山所著「窺園先生詩傳」指出移民可分五種：（一）海盜，（二）漁戶，（三）賣客，（四）規避重歛的平民，（五）倭寇的俘虜。他們民性强悍，好械鬥，最優秀的特質是保守性，反抗性很强，肯吃苦，有冒險精神，在歷史上，他們趕走了荷蘭人，而日本人統治期間，更沒使他們平靜過，三年一小亂，十年一大亂，開始時日本人採取征服態度，結果却加强了對日的反抗運動，如北埔，林圮埔，苗粟，六甲，東勢運動等，而民十九年居留日本人二二七人被殺死了一三四人的霧社事件，更是日本統治蕃族的教訓。</p>
<p>我們不能不承認台灣民族是優秀的，但是從內地來的官史們決不能持着趾高氣揚的態度來看台灣人，以對付殖民地的手法來對付台灣人，是需要修正的，因為中國決不能損失這六百餘萬的民衆！</p>
<p>三種人：</p>
<p>表示反對現實</p>
<p>但台灣人也不盡是沒有缺點的，一種島國人民的偏狹和短視，煩躁而沒有耐心，熱帶民族共通的遲鈍，怠惰，常易表露着。他們以物價之高漲，生活的不安，治安的不能從速改善，甚至病菌和貪汚，都認是內地人帶來的，他們怨恨着政府不能拔選本省人為第一級的幹部。在某一個重要的集會上，一個佔有重要地位的主管人，坦白地指出有三類人是反對現實的；（一）日本人時代的御用紳士，光復初期深怕政府嚴辦藏匿了，後來看見政府寬大為懷，又出來活動，希望取得以往的特殊地位，政府不能滿足他的慾望就生怨望了。（二）在經濟上給日本作爪牙的，以往日人劃出許多公田交給他轉租佃農，任其居間剝削，現在土地清理，政府收回，給農民取消了中間人的剝削，也告怨望了。（三）從各地返省的台胞，要求在原機關服務，光復後各種「會社」都取消了，找不到工作，也發生了怨言。這三種人都是在野的，而若干當選的參議員，更被指出以前是日本政府的紅人，可是客觀一點說，　有政治才能的本省人實在不多，最近國府規定本省選舉參政員八人，如何選拔？選舉什麽人，這就給予本省民衆的一個難題。</p>
<p>徵用的日本人在台省約二千餘人，若干確在安心地工作着，若干却「留守」在這裏另具作用。從日本來的貨船帶來了日本女人，而憲兵隊更拘獲了秘密活動的日本人。而省人因五十年來已和日本人發生了感情，他們之中有秘密和日婦結婚的，也有渴求投到日本懷抱裏去的技術人員，這現象是堪痛心的，但是現實的。</p>
<p>跟全國：</p>
<p>成一經濟集團</p>
<p>台灣是中國的一省，它和其他各省一樣，是中國的一個行政單位，沒有別繳，也無特殊之處，有的只不過是中國的土地給日本人强佔了五十年現在物歸原主。政府沒有置重點於台灣的必要，台灣也沒有作為供應國內的繼存殖民地壓榨的想法。</p>
<p>陳儀長官若干地方襲用了日本人的辦法，最大的特點是　存專賣局和統制的貿易局。實際上專賣品的樟腦，烟草，酒類，火柴，度量衡等，都沒有大希望，日本人以鴉片，食鹽及上列五種作為財政總收入38／100以上，目前也列為總收入32／100以上，但是前途很渺茫。關於這兩個局，陳儀長官說明這是總理遺教的發展國家資本的辦法，也將是三民主義在台灣實騐的苗圃。本年省預算廿四億，主要却要靠公營事業的收入，佔80／100以上，可是各企業單位在目前都陷於最大的困頓狀態，缺乏原料，沒有市場，電力，勞力價高，破壞的不能訊速恢復，恢復的又不能保持收支平衡，結果只好在田賦　實和提高稅率以及發行鈔票上想辦法了。</p>
<p>這不是：</p>
<p>東太平洋皮球</p>
<p>台灣沒有通貨膨漲，有的是慢性的，尚不能算是惡性。陳長官說物品的專賣，糖類的統制，台幣的維持，都是保全本省元氣而採取的過渡時期的措置，人們對於他所決定實施的政策，作不理解的批評，深為痛恨，而對於技術和工作人員的操守，提供修正，則樂予接受。實際上，台灣的政治固然需要名符其實的和國內配合，而經濟方面更需要和全中國成一個經濟集團始可獲得出路，特殊化，是化不得，也化不了的。台灣人害怕台灣這海島將是東太平洋上的皮球，拋來滾去；政府沒辦法把這種新生土地繼續加工耕耘，收復民心，但台灣人需要自足自給，需要營養，生活，更需要勇於負起建設責任來，是萬分迫切的。</p>
<p>台灣是中國的一省，它承受着全國的局勢而發展着，建設農業工業化的台灣和加强中國東南門戶的國防堡壘，都可以找到它的前途。事實上，它對中國並不是個癌。</p>
<p>施諦文大使過港　一張會說話的嘴巴被封閉了！</p>
<p>本報二日香港航訊　特約記者凌芳</p>
<p>英駐華新大使施諦文爵士，是一個富有自由主義思想的外交家，當他來華履新過了蘇彝士河途經「亞洲十字路」的星加坡，對記者團發表關於「香港的將來」的談話，傳抵香港時，港府當局對他便讓了七分的戒意。港中若干有責任感的新聞記者，屈指算着新大使抵港的日期，要求港府新聞處代向新大使接治訪問的時間。這麽一為，可急壞了那些不惜費盡生平氣力企圖保持香港戰前地位的殖民地官員了。他們會商了一次又一次，最後才決定新大使見不得新聞記者。新大使那些「蔣主席曾謂關於香港的將來，乃在相當時期提出討論之事。此亦為英政府的態度。」——見路透社廿二日星加坡電——的話，在別處地方說說猶可，在香港這裏却說不得。</p>
<p>施諦文大使由星加坡乘英航空母艦倫尼號，廿六日上午十時半駛抵香港，港督楊慕琦派了香港陸軍總司令菲士廷將軍和華民政務司杜德，趕到碼頭歡迎。新大使偕夫人登岸檢閱了儀仗隊，驅車進入督轅後，直至乘康斯丹號英艦離港赴滬，一個新聞記者的影子也瞧不見。他們陪大使遊覽島上風景，編排一個豐富的娛樂節目，佔據了新大使留港的全部時間。不理新大使高興與否，港府的計謀總算成功：大使會公開說話的嘴巴，畢竟給了他們封閉得密不透風。港督楊慕琦，原定廿八日訪問廣州，為了新大使，延遲了一天。</p>

<p>宋院長長女公子來山，蔣夫人對之愛護備至，除了親自帶她乘　散步外，還陪她買游泳衣叫她去游泳。五日下午，夫人和馬帥夫人偕宋小姐參觀游泳池，發現裏面設備很好，並察看溫度表七十五度，認為很合適。於是一同上街，化了八萬五千元給宋小姐買了件米黃色羊毛游泳衣，另購大草帽一頂送她。此外，夫人還買了三件羊毛背心，每件三萬五千元，二件送給馬帥夫婦，一件是為主席買的。</p>
<p>宋小姐來山，並未備草帽，但中午陽光灼人，小姐因不便拒絕乃父及姑母愛護美意，祇得將宋院長一頂草帽戴上，然走在街上，又怕路人竊語，因此，在人多的地方，就把帽子脫下，人少的地方，就再戴上。幸而由夫人買了一頂送她，小姐頓釋　狀，欣喜不止。</p>
<p>宋小姐對於衣着並不如乃母之講究，昨日上街，身穿淺藍色大翻領綢襯衫，派力斯西裝褲，褲脚直捲至膝蓋以上，腰束皮帶一根，足穿黑色平跟皮鞋，走路搖擺，頗有「牛郎」之風。小姐尤喜戴黑眼鏡，聽說在屋子裏面也老戴着，人以為她眼睛有病，其實小姐明眸皓齒，一無缺點。</p>
<p>馬帥夫婦昨晚在私邸宴邀主席夫婦，宋院長及其女公子。馬夫人身穿蔣夫人贈其之水紅色花綢中式長旗袍。蔣主席進門時即贊美其穿中國衣服十分漂亮，馬夫人聞之，高興得跳了起來。</p>
<p>宋院長上山後，大部時間都在主席官邸和主席商談要事。當你走過河東路的時候，常常可以見到主席和院長在凉台上坐談。院長因此沒有多餘時間陪他女公子出遊，特將她留在夫人處，請夫人照顧。夫人也可以多得一個伴侶，常常帶了宋小姐在花園內散步或閒談。</p>
<p>羅家倫抵牯一週，作詩已有十二首。向羅氏求詩者，多為夏令營學員及講習會會員，羅有求必應，一揮而就，氣魄雄偉，情景充沛。</p>
<p>彭部長學沛，一到牯嶺，甫人仙岩飯店，即被記者包圍，臨時舉行記者招待會，答記者關於平津路美軍被襲擊事。</p>
<p>彭氏愛好騎馬，游泳。來牯後某日興高采烈至游泳池想一獻身手，結果用手摸水連稱：「水太冷了」，祇得敗興而歸。</p>
<p>馬帥夫婦對於行館前面那張大油畫像，都並不大滿意。馬帥說：我並不見得像這樣嚴肅呀！」。</p>
<p>牯嶺日來頗多買古董的，都會講幾句洋涇浜英語，以來山洋人為他們最大主顧。這次柯克上將來牯，即有登門兜售者，柯氏曾買了他一些，但柯夫人說：「價錢真貴」。有一個着黑長衫的古董客，每次見到新主顧總要解釋：「我們是過路的，因為沒有盤船錢回老家，所以非把這些古董賣掉不可」。但如果你今天買了他一樣，他明天又來了，而且帶了大批存貨來給你挑，不知那些東西又從那裏來的。</p>
<p>蔣夫人私人秘書陳純廉女士，這次帶了她那一歲多的小寶寶住在脂紅路十五號。陳女士每日上午十時左右到夫人處辦公一二小時即回家午餐，下午如果夫人有召即赴官邸，否則總在家照料孩子。</p>
<p>勵志社來山辦公後，把牯嶺網球場，游泳池等都接收辦理。以往這些場所都由盧山管理局管理，現在生意被搶，大家心中很不以為然。</p>
<p>近日盧山天氣漸熱，無論咖啡茶室，運動場所，都人丁興旺，尤以游泳池光顧者特多。游泳票每張一千元，但實際上，真正買票的沒有幾個，多數是勵志社員或是有特別交情的。</p>

<p>記者先生：記得戰前銀行裏有一種教育儲蓄金，的確，這是好辦法，因為清貧階級的家庭，到底要佔多數，所以爹娘節蓄了一筆款子，存入銀行以後，可使兒女從小學到中學，到大學，每學期要支出的學費和書籍費等，不必另外籌劃，到期向銀行裏去一拿，轉交學校，就可以讀書了。像這樣頂好的方法，因為這次的戰爭，非但受到影響，而且竟然停辦，豈不可惜？勝利以後，銀行在上海做生意，蓬蓬勃勃，要為國民打算謀福利的，却是沒有，一門心思專做高利貸，剝削平民，說得過份一點像這種銀行佔百分之百。從六月底結賑盈餘數字方面探來消息，小的銀行錢莊，要多餘幾千萬元，大的行莊，當然不必說了。中國教育程度低落的原因，雖然很多，我想教育儲蓄金，真可幫助推進教育的好方法，還請國家銀行和商業銀行努力提倡，恢復教育儲蓄金，才好！（王學乾）</p>

<p>— 蒼石</p>
<p>假使你在電車上或者在路上被人一擠，身上的法幣及名貴的東西就離開了衣袋，也許你到商店購買東西，錢還沒有付好，東西已經不翼而飛了，有的時候你和太太或者愛人，在逛馬路，有人在面前攔住去路，跪在地上要錢你感覺到頭痛麼？</p>
<p>你心理上一定感覺到非常的憤恨，懷疑治安機關太不努力，但是我們要知道！這成千累萬的流浪者，並不是天生就是這樣的！這裏有鐵的事實在我們面前，是個月前就是使你頭痛—憤恨的人們！到今日使你感覺要流下同情的熱淚，他們個個都挺起胸膛，過着很守紀律的集體生活，並且表現着很好的自治能力。這救濟院裏分壯年團，少年營，兒童營三個部份。他們一面受教育，一面勞作，壯年團的團員們已經能爲社會服務，以前，他們是爲社會所厭棄的人，現在却一樣成爲社會上健全的份子了。</p>
<p>在這次總檢閱裏，對那些步伐整齊，英勇地向自新之路上行進的人們，吳市長很感動地說：「這是我到上海快樂的一天！」在整個的中國，這種不幸的人們，正不知有幾千萬，爲什麽不能使他們也踏進這樂園陶冶成爲社會上有用的人呢？</p>
<p>我要向社會呼籲，向慈善家請願，少做廟會少打太平醮，少過一點優裕而自私的生活，踴躍輸將，使這救濟院能够加強起來。</p>
<p>當然，根本之計，還是希望政府當局，和社會人士共同注意，改少社會上需要救濟的人。同時，治標之計，我們以爲這種管理嚴格，辦理極有成效的救濟院，應當多多添設起來，因爲，每一個在街頭飄零的流浪漢，無論如何總是我們自己的兄弟，自己的同胞！</p>

<p>— 游池沼</p>
<p>那是十六年前的事：</p>
<p>「該回家了吧，留在這裏怎是個了局！」胡老爹在默忖着。</p>
<p>胡老爹，今年六十歲了，他二十年前離開了家，簡直就沒有回去過，開始就在×局裏當書記，做了十九年，還是幹那工作，不過月薪却從十五元加到四十元了。賺來的除了養活自己，及津貼家用外，還賺來患了多年的痔瘡。去年×局調了局長，胡老爹的痔瘡恰巧發作，告了一個多星期的假，却因此通一個月四十元薪水的位置也失掉。理由是胡老爹老了，又多疾病，該休養去，而且在局裏又做了這許多年，也够啦！幸好，爲了憐他老，才發給他一年的解職金，這在局裏算是絕大的恩典。胡老爹靠了那簽費用，仍留在S市住了五個月，再想拚老命，也沒有人肯要他那廢物的了。雖然他的工作還是純熟，快當，比年青的還要强。「老啦」！胡老爹也覺得是的，牛老啦！還拉去宰了就算是報酬，所以他覺得還是人比牛好！</p>
<p>「該回家了吧，留在這裏待怎的？」他又在思索。</p>
<p>提起了家，胡老爹就記憶起自己在C城的古舊祖屋和他的三男二女。也記起了他死去的老侶伴，他的妻就在他離家的二十個年頭，把兒女婚嫁的大事都辦完了，妻的下半世，也在替孩子洗尿布，服侍第三代，這樣消磨過去，直到咽了氣爲止，那才是三年前的事。</p>
<p>聽到從C城來的人說：他知道了兒媳怎樣看待妻，和他妻咽氣前後的情形，爲了這他就沒有寄過銀錢和音信回家去。兒女也沒有過消息來，他和家隔膜了。想到家，自己又成了個陌生人。可是現在給局裏解了職，想再拼老命也沒有人要，已是五個月了，再過下去怎麽辦？就是死也得和老伴侶葬在一處啊！這才使他想起家，但想到這——三個和尙沒水吃的故事，他却愁慮了，苦思了一陣，胡老爹特然又笑了起來，結果他還是決定回家去，回到他C城的古舊祖屋去，聽說那古舊的祖屋，還住着他三房的兒媳。</p>
<p>他走去買了兩個簇新的牛皮箱子，裏面放得沉重的，連着他的幾件舊行李，便起程趁船回C城去了。</p>
<p>「啊，可不是嗎！古人也說過：「滿載而歸」「以壯行色」，」胡老爹想着，表面是笑了，下意識是憂戮的。</p>
<p>星期日的早上，船靠了C城，胡老爹在想，老年人該坐轎子回家去，又叫脚夫挑了行李，離別了廿載的C城，他覺得雖是像自已一樣老了，但模型還是一樣，道路總是認識的，轎子在進行着，也掀起胡老爹不少的懷舊情緒。</p>
<p>到家啦，只有大兒和二兒還淸楚地認識他，三兒也跟着兩個哥哥向他稱呼，他們說：</p>
<p>「爹，回來了啦！」在注視着他的全身，在注視着他的行李，尤其是那簇新的兩個牛皮箱子，胡老爹的衣着也不差，灰色的紡綢長袍，紥着裤子管，穿着新的薄底鞋。</p>
<p>挑行李的脚夫，雖在秋天，額上還留着汗，嚕嗦說行李重，要加錢。</p>
<p>「行李的確是重的」，胡老爹面上笑了，「這是爹二十年的血汙，才積了這點點，兩箱子的，舊的怕担不得重，會脫了底，才買兩隻新的，——好，該，得加你們幾個錢，」胡老爹說着，撩起長衫掏腰包，是裝滿了「鷹洋」，雪白的，亮着兒孫的眼。</p>
<p>「爹，讓我付給他們。」大兒子忙去打發轎夫，脚夫。</p>
<p>「爹，行路累了，該歇息坐坐，」二兒趕着來扶。</p>
<p>「還不給爹倒茶，遞烟！」三兒子吩咐着媳婦。</p>
<p>「呃！」胡老爹嘆了一口舒服的氣，坐在舊紫檀座椅上，問往事，話家常，數孫子。</p>
<p>「爺爺，爺爺……」三個媳婦帶領兒女向胡老爹請安。他笑了，掏出雪花銀來，分給孫子「買糖糖吃」，算是見面禮。</p>
<p>「還不快多謝爺爺！」媳婦們又敎着兒女。小口嬉笑得閙哄哄的說出來，也不怕生，圍在胡老爹膝下，有些更要扯衣裳，要拉腰包，給父母吆喝着，才睜着大眼靜下來。</p>
<p>「你們就把樓上的那個房間，收拾好，給爹住着，行李都放到我那裏。」胡老爹開始盼咐兒子們，「做人就得省，才會積起錢來，我這次也沒有買什麽給你們，可省就省了，靠我的慳儉，才積了這兩箱子的，都是爲了你們」。</p>
<p>晚上，胡老爹把自己關在房裏，數着雪花銀，叮叮鐺鐺的響了這麽久，兒媳都聽得淸楚的，大家都感到心胸舒服。</p>
<p>第二天，兩個女兒得着這消息，也帶着女婿同來見面請安了</p>
<p>他們說起胡老爹昨晚數「鷹洋」，恐怕老爹太累了，但老爹說：「老年人就是樣樣不放心，事事要自已檢點才好，你們想，箱子在船上擱；這許多天，也怕給人偷去些，不數數看，怎麽放心。」</p>
<p>他們又說，把銀子藏起來，沒出息，不如存到錢莊裏，放債給人家，做生意。胡老爹說：「你們年靑的就不懂事，現在的人心不古，錢莊也會倒閉，做生意也會虧本，還是讓我存着放心，始終是，我咽了氣，就是你們的，那時再由你們怎麽辦去。」</p>
<p>胡老爹的三個兒子，都有職業，是同住分炊的，他們商議着每人輪流養老爹一個月，老爹有時到女婿家去也盤桓幾天，有時也把小花銀分給孩子們，並做自己的零用，有時也反覆數着，總是叮叮鐺鐺響了半夜。</p>
<p>淸明，他也到過妻的墳上，回來就向兒子說：</p>
<p>「你們辦事都週到，本來我就主張省，你們媽媽墓碑也太大了，最好再短五寸，只賸五寸才省錢，土也不用培得這樣高：」說着的時候，眼圈紅起來，兒子在想他正思念媽媽，勸解開了。</p>
<p>胡老爹，就這樣由兒子們供奉過活去，鄰人，都說他比他的老伴侶有福氣的。</p>
<p>當胡老爹六十四歲那年春末，他的痔瘡病又發作起來了，比歷年的都利害，脫了肛的。坐臥不寗，他自己也覺得胃口是一天不如一天了，看着東西，咽不下多少。</p>
<p>「唔，完了，這，這些也不多了，我該走了吧！」胡老爹睡在床上，枯手把玩着十幾個「鷹洋」暗自思量着。</p>
<p>就在四月裏。當他咽氣的那天，他叫了兒女們圍在床前，人還是淸醒的，他說：</p>
<p>「你們總算把爹當人養活了幾年，可是，你們也是爹和媽敎養大的」。說到這里，他不禁落下老淚來，「我遺留的東西，就讓你們大哥哥，作主分了吧…」像感到慚愧，又像氣力不足，他停頓了一會。「可是，我們也是大戶人家，你們爺爺，你們太爺爺也爲官作宦，到了爸，時勢改變了，才做個沒出息的，你們忘記了爹吧。」不覺喘起氣來。「你們也不要像小家相，爹一閉眼，就分起來，至少，把我的後事做完再說，而且要和你媽一同合葬。」說到這里，他眼角又潤濕了，「大兒，箱子的鎖匙都交給你，要遵從爸的話，知道嗎！」說完把臉朝裏睡了，兒女們也都紅了眼。</p>
<p>胡老爹漸漸說話也不淸楚了，到旁晚就咽了氣，可是，眼睛却像是閉不攏的。</p>
<p>全家舉哀起來，天眞的小孫子更嗆着要爺爺，兒女們都在商議他的後事，原想，大家拿些錢出來，湊足了替他辦事。可是大哥都主張說：</p>

<p>這辦法，暫時大家都覺得沒有異議了，不過大家都說：「爹辛苦地積存這許多東西留給我們，我們也要讓他死後風光風光，把他和媽合葬，該竪起大石碑來的。」</p>

<p>陳列於倫敦維多利亞博物院</p>
<p>在十歲的時候，勞倫斯就開始了他的藝術生涯，用粉筆畫人像。一七八七年，他進入皇家學院。自此以後，他成爲了時髦的中心。他爲當時最美麗，最有才幹的女子繪像。畫資收入極豐，而他也揮金如土。</p>
<p>一八一五年，他為溫莎畫廊繪「滑鐵蘆的勝利者」，在旅行歐洲各大名城的時候，他也繪了許多人像。無論在社交界，或藝術界，他都獲得極大的榮譽，號稱英倫偉大畫家。</p>
<p>但是，在他死去以後，發生了一大反動，他從生前的過譽，跌入貶值的慘境。</p>
<p>事實是，勞倫斯的確畫了一些不朽的作品。有的為私人收藏，有的陳列在畫廊中，這些女人的繪像，富有高貴和詩情的特質。雖然，他着色有時不免單調，有時缺乏自然和樸實，但仍不失爲傑作。—成璐附誌</p>

<p>去年今日，是了個狂歡的日子，在重慶，人都像發了風，大喊大叫，到處是鞭砲，酒瓶和號外。記得下館子小酌，因為趟丹兄　自新疆出獄歸來，特為他接風。飯後出了館子，馬路上便掀起一陣怒潮，美國新聞處的油印小型號外日本正式投降，在到處散發，我急急忙忙趕回報館，而趙丹兄回寓時，據說屁股被馬路上亂擲的酒瓶所傷，感情的迸發，八年來　結的痛苦都得到一個宣洩，歡笑中流着淚，真不知是一種什麽滋味。</p>
<p>不僅是重慶罷，全中國各地的人們都會發生那樣的心理狀態——流着淚的笑，還有點無措的茫茫然。</p>
<p>一年以前的今日，對於未來的日子，我們是怎樣想的呢？不敢說那是一個美麗的夢，對於現實眞能理解的，是不可能存有奢望的，然而總在相信未來的日子至少比過去八年要鬆動得多，這個最低限的信念總是有的，可是過了，這三百六十五天，却連這點都打碎了，老實說，今天我們大家的痛苦，還在一年前以上。</p>

<p>— 楊謀</p>
<p>雖然我有這麽一枚圓圓的有着一朶美廲的花型的徽章，但是我怕戴上這麽一枚徽章。</p>
<p>雖然進出辦公處所時，崗警要用着嚴密的眼光找尋你的徽章，我寗可在快到他的前面時把衣襟稍稍的露起，我可不願常把它明顯的標在外而。雖然很有些人挺胸突壯的把徽章高高縣起，又神氣，又驕傲，我可只有暗暗羡慕的份，我可不敢。爲什么呢？是我不配吧，也許是怕我會給這徽章帶上些不幸，恥辱；也許是怕這徽章帶給我這些。</p>
<p>戴了徽章趁電車，明明買了票，可好像常有指油的嫌疑。有時，賣票查票特別客氣地索性不一向你要票子，有時，向你要票子時却比對待其他乘客好像多一準備。準備你也許會很窘，可你沒有什麽話可講。</p>
<p>有一次，我騎了一輛自行車，旁邊一輛自行車，因為避讓汽車，它的前輪竞檢在我的後輪，結果，它的前輪斷了幾根鋼絲。那個人蠻不講理，明明是他自己的錯，却硬要我賠，我跟他理論，他却一味硬說，旁邊看的人旣越來越多，他竟也指我的徽章大做題目，好像完全是我恃勢欺他的樣子，旁邊還有二個人說：「現在是民主了，機關的牌頭靠不成了。」眞叫我啼笑皆非。我爲了寗事息人，爲了帶上那枚徽章，只得寃枉的賠了他。</p>
<p>幸　舞塲什麼我是不去的，但是要去踄足的朋友對於徽章真是一大尅星。公務人負可不是三申五令不許去這些塲所麽，當然，你要去還是儘管好去，但是這徽章可千萬藏好。吾則的話，也不管你涇渭皂白，也許你就是做了晦氣的給猴子看而殺的雞。</p>
<p>朋友酬酢，公共場所，徽童都還是敬謝不敏。一帶徽早，就好像代表一股窮酸氣。一看見戴徵章的人在酬酢，總喜歡老把營私請託徇情況等字眼連在一塊兒，公務員的宴會酬酢，不是也有法令限制的嗎？</p>
<p>我喜歡我的工作，我喜歡我的徽章，但是，把喜歡藏在心裏，我把徽章藏在衣襟裏。</p>
<p>我不想去逛舞場，赴酬酢，但是，我的自尊，我的　怒，我也不願太多受人家一分的歧視。</p>
<p>也不知遺是我對不起徽章呢？還不知是徽章對不起我，但是，我把它谨愼地藏好。</p>

<p>但是在科學昌明的今日，誰都能證明，打醮是一件無用的事。所以在這裏用十二萬分的誠懇，請全上海的賢達人士們，決不要相信打醮，把這一筆打醮的錢完全捐在時疫或難民捐上，你想：一條里弄要化百萬元打醮，那麼全上海何止千百條里弄，這一筆總數驚人不驚人？放在時疫或難民捐上，能救活多少人？</p>

<p>— 陳淦閣</p>
<p>來自各方面的牛羣，討鞭韃着走過了橋，在河畔竭下了。船上有人很隨便地問著趕牛羣的：</p>
<p>「草料要　〕？」</p>
<p>但這顯然是多餘的，因為牛羣到現在已變爲單純的商品，主入在將商品出售以前，無論如何，已不肯加重自己商品的成本了。</p>
<p>傍河是一座畸形的建筑物，並不很高，但瞜有相當大的面積，日日夜夜有着潮水樣的人羣，牛羣，馬，和　在狹小的門擠了進去，及人羣車着各種鮮肉，又擠了出來，附近的小巷，於是顯得更熱閙了。……</p>
<p>這就是著名的世界第三大屠宰塲——沙涇路屠塲，牛·馬·猪·羊死刑的執行地，也就是本市鮮肉業供應的一大來源地。</p>
<p>淚　牛，頗有預感似的，對着大門流淚了。這是牠一生辛勞的結局：殺牠！雖流着淚，乞憐着求最後的生存，但沒有用，用淚來乞憐，始終得不到人類的同情！在拉和拖的場合下，還是一樣的呈獻着最後的禮物，——那就是牠自己的身體！</p>
<p>『這是牛的拘留所。』指導員向我說。</p>
<p>我用大手巾掩住了口和鼻，向裏深深地巡視了一回。很淸潔的，一條條牛在這兒無聲地靜待着，旁放着一堆草料。</p>
<p>『這小牛也要殺？』當我發見一對可愛的小牛時，好奇地問着。</p>
<p>『自然，牛奶貴，人所需要的是牛肉和牛奶，也就顧不得牠了，好在殺了小牛，非但有嫩的牛肉吃，還留下一份可口的鮮奶，天天擠給人喝，……』他還要說下去，我搖了搖手，順勢撫摸一下小牛的背，怪可愛的。</p>
<p>小牛昂起了頭，深深地注視着我們，想動，但顯然是初生的小犢，還不會行動呢。</p>
<p>「那邊在動手了，你願意去不？」他催促着，於是不得不提起新的步伐，前進！</p>
<p>死　機扯一動，一條牛翻了下去，在下面很費力地又站了起來。</p>
<p>「沒有死？我驚訝地問。</p>
<p>「現在還早哩，沒有電流，祇好用錘錘死了再殺，你看！」</p>
<p>我看見一個人舉起一把柄有牛丈長的大錘，正用力在錘下去，我忙廻避了不忍卒看。待再問頭時，幾個人已經在用最熟練的手法，支解着那頭牛。我不禁深深的透了一口氣。</p>
<p>我要求走了。那指導員卻說：</p>
<p>「你真胆小，屠夫每天要殺三百多頭呢！」</p>
<p>三百多頭！一個好大的數目，我怔了一怔。</p>
<p>因爲是早晨，許多地方都空着，屠夫們閒散地在撩天，我問他們：「你們殺過最大的牛有多火？」</p>
<p>『最大的？』他們很快樂地：「有一丈長，一千多磅重，是新加坡種。」</p>
<p>『牛的來源怎樣，你可能告訴我嗎？』</p>
<p>『大部份是江北口岸來的，在徐州，海州一帶。』</p>
<p>「你們可吃牛肉？」</p>
<p>笑　他們都笑了起來，說：『自然愛吃的。』又反問着我：×怎麽？難道先生不愛吃怎個？」</p>
<p>我皺了皺眉、對他們道：「今天恐怕迎飯也吃不下了。」</p>
<p>他們又笑了。</p>
<p>走到鬥口，有人在論價賣牛，我走了上去，問道：「這不是耕牛吧？」</p>
<p>「是耕牛呀，先生」</p>
<p>「耕牛？賣了，不耕田了？」</p>
<p>「咦！還沒太平，田不好耕，索性賣了多口飯吃，多幾個錢繳糧；其實，先生，誰又願意把牠賣掉呢？」殺牛，賣牛，」　人感想無盡！</p>

<h3 id="e1">Peace Talks Become Active Again: Marshal Separately Meets with Yu and Zhou for Talks, and Discusses Opinions with Stuart <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 9th] Marshal Special Envoy, at 9:00 AM on the 9th, met with Ambassador Stuart. The meeting concluded at 9:45 AM. It is reported that the content of the discussion was a comprehensive review of the results of Ambassador Stuart's talks with Zhou Enlai and Chairman Jiang's attitude towards Marshal, as expressed at Guangshan, to serve as a basis for further negotiations with Zhou Enlai. Yu Dawei visited at 10:30 AM and left at 12:30 PM. At 4:00 PM, Zhou Enlai visited Marshal as scheduled. Subsequently, Ambassador Stuart arrived at 7:00 PM and had dinner together. Zhou left at 7:30 PM, while Ambassador Stuart continued the talks until approximately 11:00 PM before departing. It is rumored that the meeting between Ambassador Stuart and Marshal included discussions on the attitude of the United States towards the Anping Incident. Marshal will meet with Zhou Enlai again at 10:00 AM on the 10th for further talks.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 9th] Due to unexpected incidents, the peace talks, which had temporarily subsided, have become active again since Marshal returned to Nanjing. Marshal met with Ambassador Stuart on the morning of the 9th, then received Minister Yu Dawei. In the afternoon, at 4:30 PM, he received Zhou Enlai, representative of the Chinese Communist Party. The content of the talks is unknown.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 9th] According to reports: The U.S. State Department has recently sent three telegrams to Marshal, expressing dissatisfaction with the attack on U.S. Marines near Beiping, but this statement has not been officially confirmed. Furthermore, Marshal and Ambassador Stuart hope to understand the attitude of the Communist Party so that peace negotiations can be successful.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Chen Lifu's Talk with Foreign Reporters: The CCP is Creating Civil War, Delaying to Strengthen Power <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>[United Press, This City Dispatch] Minister of Organization Chen Lifu met with reporters from United Press today. According to the conversation: The Chinese Communist Party is creating a civil war and placing the responsibility on others. The Communist Party's words and actions do not match, they are accustomed to deception, and their statements have no value. They are currently delaying. The Kuomintang's goal is to resolve the Chinese situation through political means, but the CCP is only delaying negotiations to gain time, strengthen its power, and wait for an opportunity to eliminate the Kuomintang. The CCP does not allow other parties to operate in its controlled areas. Marshal Special Envoy and Ambassador Stuart's "attitude is unusually sincere, and they are working very hard." Marshal and Ambassador Stuart still base their mediation on the CCP's willingness to resolve the issue politically, but will eventually understand that the CCP is merely stalling for time.</p>
<p>Four Proposals from Yan'an</p>
<p>The Yan'an Central Political Bureau passed four proposals on March 20, the content of which fully demonstrates no intention of peaceful negotiations. The government has learned the content of the four proposals as follows: (1) Do everything possible to divide the Kuomintang, causing its reactionary and progressive elements to attack each other, try to approach the progressive elements, and attack the reactionary elements; (2) Purge Kuomintang secret agents and the "CC Clique"; (3) Strive for American sympathy, continue negotiations with the government, but never allow any issue to be resolved. This allows the CCP to gain time to strengthen its military and political power in its controlled areas. Currently, the most important effort should be to occupy the Northeast and isolate Peiping and Tianjin, and then occupy the entire North China; (4) Use all methods to alienate the United States from the government so that the United States no longer provides military and economic assistance to the government.</p>
<p>The above is the CCP's policy, but in the Northeast, the CCP has already failed. I have ten years of experience dealing with the Communist Party and know them better than anyone else in China.</p>
<p>Never Abides by Agreements</p>
<p>Any agreement that the Communist Party acknowledges today, even if it is in black and white, cannot be expected to be followed tomorrow, and their words are practically meaningless. All their actions are to achieve an urgent, immediate goal, so the CCP is a realist. They are selfish, cruel, unreliable, and have no love for the country. The Communist Party focuses its attacks on individuals, calling me a "reactionary element." Anyone who opposes the Communist Party is considered a reactionary element. If you still believe that the Communist Party has any morality, you will inevitably go astray. I have been deceived by the Communist Party many times, and all agreements made with the Communist Party are worthless. They lack sincerity, which is a necessary condition for any agreement. Before the Sino-Japanese War, I represented the government in negotiations with the CCP and offered a final solution opportunity. Unfortunately, the CCP did not fulfill its promise in September 1937, namely "to obey Chiang President's orders, support the Three Principles of the People, abolish the Soviet government within China, and have the CCP army under the command of the supreme commander of the National Army." The CCP has abused its opportunity, and my conclusion is that they do not want to cooperate with the Kuomintang. The Kuomintang does not want to engage in civil war, but the CCP wants to seize power through civil war without taking responsibility for initiating the civil war. Before the ceasefire agreement was signed on January 10 this year, the CCP occupied less than 70 cities; today, they occupy more than 200 cities, which proves that the CCP is violating the ceasefire agreement, and even if it is in black and white, it is still a consistent deceptive tactic.</p>
<p>History Can Prove It</p>
<p>A brief review of modern history may help people better understand the CCP. From 1935 to 1937, because the War of Resistance was inevitable, I exhausted myself in studying the possibility of a Kuomintang-Communist compromise so that the two parties could unite against the common enemy, Japan. China needed to save every drop of blood for the War of Resistance against Japan. If the government had wanted to resort to force, it could have easily eliminated the CCP before the war, but the government decided to preserve the country's strength for a war with Japan. The government, recognizing the serious threat from Japan, urgently wanted to accommodate the CCP and permanently end the historical disputes between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, so it initiated negotiations with the CCP, which lasted for a long time. When the War of Resistance broke out, I immediately asked the CCP to immediately announce its four promises, which the CCP finally announced in September. The government did not easily eliminate the CCP, but was again deceived, because the CCP did not fulfill its promises.</p>
<p>Origin of the Term "CC"</p>
<p>Chen continued to narrate the various facts of the CCP's deception of the Kuomintang in the past 23 years (since 1923). After occupying the area south of the Yangtze River, the Communist Party, fearing that the Kuomintang would complete the Northern Expedition, again went back on its word, collaborated with Wang Jingwei in Hankou, established a "government," and "removed" Chiang Chairman from the position of Commander-in-Chief. To prevent the revolutionary work from being threatened, the Kuomintang immediately established a government in Nanjing, continued the Northern Expedition, and implemented a purge. Seeing the success of the Northern Expedition, Wang Jingwei once again resorted to opportunism, abandoned the Communist Party, and said: During 1929, the new warlords still controlled the area north of the Yangtze River. The Kuomintang then organized secret groups in the areas occupied by the warlords, intending to disband the secret groups after the warlords were eliminated, and their members could openly become Kuomintang members. These secret groups had different names. The reason why I mention this is to explain the origin of the term "CC," which was fabricated by the Communist Party. Chen Guofu had a group called the Central Club, but in reality, there was no such organization as the Central Club. I and Chen Guofu never organized the so-called "CC Clique." Anyone who understands the situation in China knows that Chinese people never use their own names as the names of any organization. The term "CC" quickly disappeared without a trace. It was not until the September 18th Incident that the Japanese brought up this term again, and it began to appear in Japanese newspapers. The Japanese knew that the most ardent group in China to resist Japan was the Kuomintang, so they used the term "CC Clique" to insult it.</p>
<p>Three Conclusions Reached</p>
<p>Finally, Chen said: I have reached three conclusions: (1) The Communist Party regards every person as a tool; (2) The Communist Party regards every action as a means; (3) Every word spoken by the Communist Party is only to adapt to the needs of the time. If the Communist Party can change its basic attitude, there may be some hope for a peaceful solution. Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, I have not participated in political struggles against the Communist Party, because I was transferred to the post of Minister of Education in December 1932 until 1944, when I returned to the post of Minister of Organization.</p>

Furthermore, the telephone line between Lili and Pingwang in Wujiang has been cut off by bandits. The town chiefs and Bao chiefs there have all fled. It is said that the bandits from the Yang Fei's unit in Taihu Lake and the Zhou Fei, a self-defense force that defected from Xincheng, have merged, attempting to move towards the above areas. After being detected by the Jiangsu Provincial Security Command, it has ordered the counties of Kunshan and Wujiang to encircle and suppress the bandits within a time limit, and also ordered the Suzhou County government to assist.</p>

<h3 id="e8">Issue of Reclaiming the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway: Sino-French Negotiations to be Held in Nanjing, Two Countries to Seek Joint Economic and Commercial Development <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 9th] It has been rumored that the French side has agreed to allow us to reclaim the Yunnan section of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway by providing funds, and France has also acknowledged compensation for the losses of public and private materials in Vietnam in 1940, offsetting the price of that section. However, according to information obtained by this reporter from the government, the issue of reclaiming the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway was mentioned in the Sino-French New Treaty signed on February 28 this spring, but the outcome is currently unknown. Furthermore, according to personnel from the French Embassy, since this spring, the two sides have only exchanged some opinions on this issue, and formal negotiations are still pending. It is said that it is not appropriate to speculate too much when a solution to this issue has not been reached. However, according to this reporter's investigation, formal negotiations on the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway issue will indeed begin here soon. The French economic advisory group led by Dr. Moore arrived in Nanjing a few days ago. The current task of the group is to quickly conduct extensive research and discussion with the Chinese government on various economic issues between China and France, discuss the losses of official and civilian interests suffered by both sides during the war, and jointly seek the development of Sino-French commercial and economic cooperation.</p>
<h3 id="e9">Investigation of the Anping Incident: Communist Side Obstructs in Every Possible Way, 25th Group Sat Idle in the Fields Yesterday <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 9th] The Military Mediation Department's 25th Group departed for Anping Town at 2:30 PM on the 9th to investigate the attack on the U.S. military on July 29. They returned to Beiping that evening without results. The group is composed of nine Communist Party members, four government officials, and three American representatives. The government group leader is Zhang Shuheng, the Communist Party group leader is Huang Yifeng, and the American group leader is Davis. After the cars left Dongzhimen, soldiers from the 92nd Army followed to protect them. Communist Party representative Huang Yifeng protested. Government representative Zhang Shuheng immediately indicated that the National Army did not need to follow. Zhang and Huang agreed that in the National Army area, the government representative's car would lead the way, and after entering the "Liberated Area," the Communist Party representative's car would lead the way. When the cars arrived at Anping Town, they did not encounter the Communist army. Major Michael, who witnessed the attack on Anping Town, pointed out the location of the incident and the circumstances of the attack on the spot. Ban Changru, the county magistrate of Xianghe, also arrived at the scene, intending to report the incident to the group. Communist Party representatives insisted on reserving their opinion on these reports, believing that since Anping and surrounding areas were stationed by the National Army, all witnesses and material evidence had been changed and were insufficient as a basis. The three parties argued inconclusively, sitting idle in the fields for a long time. Finally, the Communist Party indicated a concession, believing that the report of the local county magistrate could be heard, but the report of the Communist Party military and political authorities must be heard in the "Liberated Area." Government representatives emphasized that to clarify the truth, the investigation must be thoroughly conducted at the scene of the incident. The American group extended the invitation to Major Michael. The witness had traveled to Tibet. He cited Tibet as an example, saying: In Tibet, disputes are resolved by gathering the public at the scene of the incident for public judgment. Communist Party representatives still disagreed, and the three parties returned to Beiping.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 9th] The Military Mediation Department's 25th Group, which departed for Anping Town yesterday to inspect the scene, was again stranded on the beach of "investigation procedures" today. From 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM, the group held a meeting. The American side extended the invitation to a representative from the U.S. Marine Corps headquarters to report on the Anping incident. The Communist Party first proposed verifying the identity of the representative from the Marine Corps headquarters. After verification, the Communist Party still opposed listening to the representative's report, believing that the "investigation procedure" must be established first before proceeding to listen to the report. The meeting ended at noon without results. At 2:30 PM, the meeting resumed for discussion. One American reporter and two government reporters (one from the Central News Agency and one from this newspaper) were present. Communist Party representative Huang Yifeng opposed the participation of reporters for the following reasons: (1) Reporters' participation should be limited to the discussion of investigation materials; (2) The Communist Party reporter has not yet arrived. Huang continued to oppose listening to the Marine Corps headquarters representative's report before the "investigation procedure" was established. The American and Communist sides debated fiercely until 3:00 PM. American representative Davis proposed an adjournment to consult with Commissioner Robertson, and Huang also consulted with Ye Jianying. The meeting was announced to resume at 4:46 PM. At that time, a Communist Party reporter had arrived from Zhangjiakou. The Communist Party indicated a concession, agreeing to reporters attending the meeting, but insisted on the "investigation procedure" drafted by the Communist Party. The procedure was (1) Listen to the report of the Marine Corps headquarters; (2) Listen to the report of the Communist Party local military and political authorities; (3) Listen to the report of the government local military authorities; (4) Determine the witnesses from all three sides and listen to the witnesses' reports; (5) Other necessary measures; (6) Summarize the investigation report and have the three commissioners publish the news. Davis largely agreed to the procedure he drafted, but believed that the U.S. Marine Corps headquarters report should be heard immediately and work should not be delayed by planning procedures. In the end, no agreement was reached, and the meeting ended on an unhappy note. It was decided to discuss it again at 9:00 AM on the 10th. During the meeting on the 9th, Davis held his drooping head in his hands, seemingly overwhelmed by the brain drain. Furthermore, the three committees decided to send a liaison group from the Communist Party to contact the Communist Party's Jidong Military Region to prepare for the investigation, but they had not yet departed as of the afternoon of the 9th.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 9th] The Military Mediation Department's 25th Group, which was investigating the case of the attack on the U.S. military in Xianghe, has been unable to conduct the investigation because the Communist Party has been obstructing it in every possible way under the pretext of procedural issues, and the truth cannot be revealed. An observer told reporters that the purpose of the Communist Party's actions is nothing more than two points: one is to attempt to end the matter without resolving it and delay it to reduce public attention; the other is to delay and harass the American side, forcing the American side to propose a solution directly when it is unable to do so, and then use it as a propaganda argument to accuse the U.S. military's actions in China of being too subjective and making claims about events without clarifying the truth.</p>

<p>Tianjin and Beijing Industry Is in Imminent Danger</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 9th] A person in charge today sighed and said that dealing with the takeover is really difficult. After the inspection team arrived, it ordered the takeover agencies to send the original manifest if it had not been sent, but some ignored it, and some replied that it had been submitted to the competent department. Therefore, it is not dare to be certain whether the inspection team can do anything. Jinyanshenxing also pointed out that due to the instability of the overall situation, the central government has ignored the importance of North China's economy, and under the policy of military first and finance first, economic policy is not valued. As a result, many important factories in Tianjin and Beijing are still unable to produce effectively today, and state-owned key industries are mostly paralyzed, with operators unable to do anything. Due to the influx of foreign goods, private industries are unable to maintain themselves. In fact, if the government can enable these endangered industries to compete with foreign goods for one year, they can safely survive. The government's emphasis on Shanghai and ignoring North China is in danger. In addition, it is known that the second auction of factories being taken over in Tianjin and Beijing is being held. There are more buyers than the first time, because this time it also comes with a loan of a considerable amount of working capital to help them operate.</p>

<h3 id="e18">A Record of Aerial Inspection Over the Flood in Northern Jiangsu <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>— By Zhang Ming, Our Correspondent in Nanjing</p>
<p>Can you believe that the water that God gives us to live on has now become a weapon of tyranny! The large-scale breaches in Northern Jiangsu are the result of the Communist army's venting its anger after losing its military offensive in Northern Jiangsu. The flood came like an avalanche, and the lives and property of millions of innocent compatriots were swallowed up here.</p>
<p>Can you imagine countless people living on rooftops that are barely above water, eating wind and sleeping in dew? This is the "benevolent governance" bestowed by the Communist army! But the Communist army says, "This is caused by the rising floodwaters." However, why does the "democratic government," which is "all for the people," turn a blind eye? In any case, it cannot be denied that the Communist army of the "democratic government" "masters" the lives and property of the "people."</p>
<p>Facts speak louder than words. Today, this fact is finally unfolding before the eyes of our group of Chinese and foreign journalists.</p>
<p>The motive is as follows: At the foreign press conference of the Central Propaganda Department on the 6th, someone proposed to go to Northern Jiangsu for an on-the-spot inspection. With the permission of the Central Propaganda Department, a special plane was dispatched to transport us to the inspection. Thus, on the morning of the 9th, fifteen Chinese and foreign journalists gathered at the Lishi Society and set off for the airport. The units they represented were: United Press, Associated Press, International News Service, The New York Times, New York Herald Tribune, Reuters, Indian Free Press, Agence France-Presse, and domestic newspapers Shanghai Shen Bao, Ta Kung Pao, Southeast Daily, Central News Agency, Nanjing Central Daily, Dagan Bao, and Xinmin Evening News. In addition, personnel from the International Publicity Department and the Ministry of National Defense were sent along on the same plane to serve as translators and explainers. Zhong Da, a liaison officer from the 12th Squadron of the Air Force, was also sent to provide terrain information. In total, there were twenty people. At 10:00 AM, we boarded plane (C-51 1296) and departed, driven by Deng Congshou and Zhang Bainian, with Zhou Ronghui and Xiong Ke as communicators. The trip was expected to be 420 English miles, departing from Nanjing, passing through Suqian, Yaowan, and Zhaodun, the Yunhe station near Xuzhou, then flying along the railway line through Xinan Town, directly to Donghai and Guanyun, and returning to Nanjing via Zhundui. There were four flooded areas along the way: (1) Zhaodun, (2) Xinan Town, (3) Shangfang Street, (4) Qiaoche Town.</p>
<p>The pilot maintained an altitude of 3,000 feet at all times to avoid accidents. We boarded the plane at 10:00 AM, and it took ten minutes to ascend. The temperature changed from hot to cool. White clouds floated past the wings of the plane. After passing through Zhubao Town, we reached Jintai and entered the Communist-controlled area. From here, we could only see water below. Because the water level of Hongze Lake was very high, the low-lying areas along the lake and the farmland were flooded with a lot of water. It was 10:37 AM and we were over the lake. After passing Hongze Lake, we found many deep black lines on the ground, matching the vast green plain. It is said that the black ones are dikes and the green ones are still water. These are the small rivers specially controlled by the Communist army to divert water into the villages. At this time, we removed the cabin door on the plane, and the investigators looked down, and a small number of people looked with binoculars. At 10:50 AM, we arrived at Yangbeiji. From here, the scenes of the breaches were clearly visible. The water was shining, and only the green roots of the trees were dotted among them, like stars in the dark sky. After passing this flooded area, irregular water flows could still be found scattered in the fields. At 11:10 AM, we flew over Suqian. The water was increasing sharply. The fuselage lowered and circled the area once. There were eight breaches, and the flooded area was 18 square miles, which was also the smallest area, namely Yaowan. At 11:20 AM, we passed Yaowan, and the plane pointed to Zhaodun. According to the explanation of the liaison officer of the Ministry of National Defense, this breach was 1,400 feet long, and the flooded area was 156 square kilometers. The bridge markers had been destroyed and washed away. Looking down, we only saw the water waves and the sun reflecting, sparkling in thousands of points. Naturally, this was not still water. The water was still surging rapidly. It is said that ten days ago, there was no water in this flooded area, and a week ago, there was only a small amount of water, but today the water has reached a vast area.</p>
<p>From 11:35 AM, we turned east and began to fly along the Longhai Railway. The Longhai Railway seemed to be still. The vehicles did not move because the bridges were destroyed and the roadbed was cut into sections. The person who explained pointed to us and said that it was almost cut into thousands of sections.</p>
<p>The pilot maintained an altitude of 3,000 feet at all times to avoid accidents that no one dared to guarantee.</p>
<p>Continuing east, we arrived over Donghai at 11:50 AM. There were 37 breaches here, and the flooded area was 202 square kilometers. The plane passed around it. We all wanted to find a little land in the water, but water, water, water, you close your eyes and it is still water. Everywhere there were breaches like broken strings, and the flood was flowing rapidly. We couldn't find the shadows of villages or houses, and we didn't see a person or a boat. We couldn't imagine where they had gone. On the "oases" that we occasionally saw, we could see golden things being dried on the ground. It turned out that this was their food - the tops of corn trees. The rooftops became the star-scattered pieces in the chessboard, occasionally appearing in the middle of the water. Looking down from the plane, it was already unchanging, all big water. It was 12:35 PM, so we turned south again to the Guanyun flooded area. There were 122 breaches here, and the flooded area was 100 square kilometers. How many lives were swallowed up by it!</p>
<p>After circling the flooded area, the direction pointed southwest, and the journey back began. Slowly, we saw the lovely land, tens of thousands of acres of fields, and our mood was relaxed. At this time, we passed Huaiyin, the hub of the Communist army in Northern Jiangsu, but we were blocked by the clouds and didn't see anything. It was 12:50 PM.</p>
<p>Our journey back to Nanjing began at 1:00 PM. The foreign journalists first fell asleep in the belly of the plane, and the fuselage also shook uneasily. We returned to Minggugong Airport hungry, and the time was exactly 1:50 PM, bringing back thousands of "tragic" words. Is this the work of mankind? We cannot believe it! (Sent from Nanjing on August 9)</p>

<h3 id="e21">Director Jiang Talks About Relief Work, UNRRA Should Continue Its Work, Eggerton to Depart for China Within Days From Geneva <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] After La Guardia advocated at the UNRRA Congress that UNRRA activities should be concluded around October 10 and that he should be relieved of his own duties, Director Jiang Tingfu of the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CRRRA) officially expressed his opposition yesterday. Jiang stated that the relief and rehabilitation work in the Far East and Europe has not yet been completed. If UNRRA is terminated, another international organization must be established to handle this issue, and setting up another organization will take considerable time. UNRRA's work is unfinished, and its mid-term termination will inevitably cause many difficulties. Jiang advocated that all countries should allow UNRRA to continue its work and terminate it only after one year in order to complete the minimum goals that UNRRA wanted to achieve when it was established.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Geneva, 8th] Chinese representative Li Zhuomin stated at the UNRRA meeting today that some UNRRA China Office staff do not understand China's difficulties. Most of them only stay in Shanghai and are inevitably separated from the actual situation in China. Li then suggested that the United Nations agency should make humanitarian work a part of its entire mission, and also advocated that member states donate funds to relieve disasters that occur at any time. Regarding UNRRA's work in China, Li said that the person in charge of the UNRRA China Office changes from time to time, making it difficult for policies to be consistent, so much time is spent on adjustments. Many war supplies purchased by UNRRA in the Pacific region do not have instructions when they arrive in China, so they must be opened box by box before they can know what is in the box and then determine the allocation policy. Some machines are not suitable for use in China, and other machines or important items have missing parts or need major repairs. The Chinese government is willing to do its best to cooperate with UNRRA to make UNRRA's plan a success. Before Li's speech, representatives from five countries, including the Czech Republic, Poland, Yugoslavia, Austria, and Greece, requested that UNRRA extend its relief work in Europe to 1947.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 8th] UNRRA's new director of the China Office, Eggerton, said today that he will depart for China within days to seek solutions to the allocation issues between UNRRA and CRRRA. At the same time, UNRRA Acting Director Logus said that UNRRA relief supplies are flooding Shanghai, and from all aspects, the fault does not lie with China. We are forced by transportation conditions to ship many items to Shanghai, and the Chinese side has not received a notice, but we hope that we can soon have unlimited shipping.

<p>China Can Be Self-Sufficient in Five Years</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taipei, 9th] Taiwan Sugar Corporation recently released the current status of sugar production in various countries around the world, stating that according to the average statistics from 1935 to 1939, the world's annual sugar production before the war was a total of 34.5 million tons, but according to the famous Lamorghillon Sugar Market Report of the world sugar industry, the report in June of this year stated that last year (i.e., the 1945-1946 period), the world's sugar production had shrunk to 27.2 million tons, with Cuba accounting for the first place, Java second, India third, and Taiwan fourth. The company's conclusion is: "Cuban, Javanese, and Indian sugar are currently unable to invade the Chinese market." The company also stated: "China's annual sugar demand is about 800,000 to 1 million tons. According to Taiwan Sugar Corporation's five-year production increase plan, by the winter of the 37th year, that is, the 1947-1948 period, it will only be able to produce 500,000 tons of sugar. If it wants to increase production to 800,000 tons, it must work hard for five years. If it wants to obtain the Japanese market, it must wait for the implementation of the second five-year plan.</p>
<h3 id="e23">Catholic Priests and Others in Shandong Detained and Abused by the Communist Army, The Vatican Has Received a Report and Will Appeal to General Marshall <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Nanjing, 8th] A certain Catholic priest recently fled here from the CCP border area of ​​Hebei, Shandong, Henan, and Anhui. According to his statement, more than 100 Catholic priests in the dioceses of Yanzhou and Caozhou in Shandong Province, including priests of Canadian, Belgian, Polish, Yugoslav, and Hungarian nationalities, are currently in a dangerous situation. The Caozhou CCP authorities arrested the 68-year-old Archbishop Huwaz (probably of Dutch nationality) on July 15 this year. Ten German priests and nuns were also arrested at the same time. The hospital established by the church, with the best equipment in the entire city, has been closed, and the patients in the hospital have also been expelled. According to the local CCP authorities, the arrests were caused by reports from residents. From July 15 to 22, there were frequent mass gatherings in the city, sometimes with as many as 3,000 people each time. The city authorities told them, "You are backward elements, you want to drink foreigners' water." After these people refused to accuse the Catholic Church, the authorities educated them. Representatives from the business community and the private sector repeatedly appealed for the release of the detainees, but were not granted. The detainees were tried once on July 25, but remained in prison until the 28th and were not sentenced. The detainees were paraded through the streets twice a day on July 22 and 23, directly to the church. A wooden sign was placed outside the church with the words "This is where the criminals are located." The holy relics of the church were exposed. Archbishop Huwaz fainted several times due to his old age and frailty. The public witnessed his pitiful situation, but could not help him. The situation of the Catholic Church in the area has been reported to Archbishop Cai Ning, the representative of the Holy See. The Vatican authorities have also received the report, and the US Embassy in the capital has also taken note of this. This matter will probably be reported to Special Envoy Marshall, requesting him to forward the question to the CCP. However, according to people around General Marshall, they have not received this report.</p>
<p>At the same time, CCP spokesman Wang Bingnan declared today: "Our purpose is not to attack the church. We know nothing about this unexpected incident." When reporters asked whether the CCP discriminated against German Catholics, the spokesman replied: "No, unless these people's behavior endangers the 'liberated area,' then we will treat them differently."</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] According to reliable sources: Premier Song, in order to thoroughly investigate the "CNRRA" (Chinese National Relief and Rehabilitation Administration) case, specially dispatched Yin Zhongrong, Secretary of the Executive Yuan, and Xia Pinfang, Councilor, to Shanghai to conduct an on-site thorough investigation.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3 id="e31">A Review of Post-War Relief Work <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>According to a United Press report from Geneva on the 7th: LaGuardia, Director-General of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA), will come to China in October to inspect the situation. UNRRA's Eastern operations will end on March 31st of next year. However, according to CNRRA Director-General Jiang, the date UNRRA ends is at the end of this year. CNRRA was originally scheduled to end at the end of March next year, but because China is vast and transportation is difficult, China hopes to extend the CNRRA's working time to September 30th of next year, because in China, "time" is "material."</p>
<p>We sympathize with Director-General Jiang's view that "time is material," and naturally, we are even more in favor of extending the time limit for CNRRA's work. However, we cannot but deeply review how the past post-war relief work has been. Otherwise, even if the time is extended, if the work is still inefficient, wouldn't it be even more shameful? How the "CNRRA" has been working since its establishment a year ago has long been a concern of the Chinese people. We are willing to take advantage of the upcoming visit of the Director-General of UNRRA to China for inspection and the special meeting of UNRRA's Far East representatives held in Shanghai today to conduct a brief review.</p>
<p>First of all, what we want to raise is that "UNRRA" should quickly issue a removal of the ban on the shipment of materials to China. The issuance of the ban on the shipment of materials to China seems to have not been carefully considered in advance, which is really a regrettable thing. Now that the Director-General of UNRRA has explained that the matter is entirely due to the congestion of Chinese port ships in June, and it is expected that the situation will greatly improve in September, then it is already mid-August, why is the ban, which is not very reasonable, still not lifted? As for a part of the staff of a local office openly publishing a letter criticizing the post-war relief agency in their resident country, it not only shows that the "UNRRA" staff is undisciplined, but also shows that the "UNRRA" itself has organizational flaws. We cannot solely blame CNRRA.</p>
<p>Speaking of "CNRRA," we should have a recognition that its work is arduous and subject to various objective constraints. Its work certainly cannot be satisfactory in all aspects. The lack of transportation, the unrest in the localities, and the failure of cooperation between government departments to meet ideal expectations, all make its work unable to achieve its ideal. The vast scope of "CNRRA's" activities, coupled with the aforementioned difficulties, further hinders "CNRRA's" work. According to Director-General Jiang Tingfu, the amount of materials now handled by "CNRRA" is equivalent to three times the total amount of goods imported by our country before the war, and its value is equivalent to twice the total national budget of our country before the war. Because its scope of activities is so vast and it is still in its infancy, it is natural to forgive the fact that "CNRRA's" activities have not been as satisfactory as expected. But what we do not understand is: (1) In terms of selling relief materials, what is the policy adopted by "CNRRA"? (2) Since "CNRRA" is a department of the Executive Yuan, why can the system of "CNRRA" be outside the general government system?</p>
<p>Regarding the first point, that is, in terms of selling relief materials, we know that the amount of materials under the control of "CNRRA" is extremely large. Part of the relief materials was originally agreed by "UNRRA" to be sold, that is, to use the proceeds to operate post-war relief business - it is said that the proceeds are used to maintain the expenses of the organization. But is the purpose of selling these relief materials entirely for revenue, or does it have a role in stabilizing domestic prices in addition to revenue? If it is the former, then post-war relief is only a nominal name. In fact, isn't it close to a large-scale trust that specializes in import trade with preferential conditions? As a result, it only makes the almost collapsing national economy worse, which seems to be contrary to the original intention of post-war relief. Now the cotton in the hands of "CNRRA" can supply yarn factories across the country. We do not understand why "CNRRA" has supplied this cotton to public and private yarn factories, but it has not been able to achieve the practical effect of suppressing yarn prices? According to Director-General Jiang, the power to suppress yarn prices is not in the hands of "CNRRA." This may be partly true, but what we do not understand is why "CNRRA" has so much huge amount of materials but cannot make efforts to stabilize prices, but still sits and watches the rise in yarn prices? Everything seems to point to a fact, that is, "CNRRA" only increases revenue, not only has it not made efforts to suppress prices, but also its dumping of materials inevitably helps to increase prices. In terms of handling the sale of relief materials, we want to ask where is the policy of "CNRRA"?</p>
<p>According to Director-General Jiang's previous statement at the Legislative Yuan's inquiry session: "CNRRA" has a 50% welfare fund for its staff in addition to the general civil servant treatment in order to prevent corruption, which is not available to general civil servants. What we do not understand is: If "CNRRA" is a part of the government, then its staff should be no different from general civil servants. The stipulation of this special treatment is obviously intended to undermine the general civil servant system and form a separate system outside the general civil servant system, which is tantamount to undermining the unity of national administration and the unity of the system. If it is to prevent corruption, we want to ask whether "CNRRA" can achieve a clean and upright administration with the addition of a 50% welfare fund? Furthermore, "CNRRA" certainly wants to prevent corruption, but doesn't any other agency need to prevent corruption? May I ask if any other agency has a 50% welfare fund? Some people outside deliberately say that the Relief Administration should be called "Relief Self-Administration." We hope that CNRRA will use facts to wash away this insult.</p>
<p>We understand the arduousness of "CNRRA's" work, but we cannot allow the unity of the national administrative system to be undermined because of the arduousness of the work, and we cannot allow the lack of policy in handling the sale of relief materials, which instead promotes the wealth of a few and the suffering of the majority. We hope that the government can pay attention to the implementation of this important policy, which is closely related to the prosperity and decline of the people's livelihood and economy and the revival of the nation, so that it can make necessary improvements.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper's Bengbu Correspondence] Ni Daolang, the former Anhui puppet governor and huge traitor, has been interrogated several times by the High Branch Court here. The debate has ended, and the sentence was pronounced at 4:00 p.m. on the 5th. At about 3:00 p.m., Ni was brought from the detention center to the trial room by bailiffs. Ni looked old and decadent, and was extremely tired. His left hand was wrapped around a rosary, silently chanting the name of Buddha. At 4:00 p.m. sharp, the trial judge Xu Guangdian, together with judges Wang Yujian and Li Xibi, and clerk Liu Jianwu, arrived in court in sequence. Judge Xu routinely asked for his name, and then said that the sentence for Ni Daolang's case would be pronounced at noon. Then he stood up and read the main text of the judgment: Ni Daolang colluded with the enemy country and plotted to resist this country, sentenced to death, deprived of public rights for life, and all property confiscated, except for the necessary living expenses for family members. Ni's face turned pale immediately after hearing the verdict. Judge Xu continued to read the reasons for the crime and the judgment, as well as the articles of the law that he violated, and said that if he did not agree with the verdict, he could appeal to the Supreme Court for review within ten days. At this point, he ordered him to be returned to custody and then adjourned the court.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Paris, Broadcast on the 9th: The Peace Conference continued at approximately 4 PM today (midnight in Shanghai). Chairman Bidault proposed that the conference adopt the regulations committee's resolution to permit journalists to attend meetings of the various committees, which was approved. Bidault then stated that he has chaired the conference eight times and that according to regulations, he should relinquish the chairmanship to another previously selected chairman. Bernas expressed his respect for the representatives of the host country and argued that Bidault should continue as chairman for the next three days, as Bidault's responsibilities as chairman only truly began this afternoon. Australian representative Evatt supported Bernas's opinion. Bidault replied that he did not wish to shirk his responsibilities, but rather to strictly adhere to the regulations. It was then decided that he would continue as chairman for another three days. Soviet representative Vyshinsky rose to speak, questioning who was responsible for arranging the conference agenda, stating that he did not have a Russian version of the agenda and that it was the result of a lack of organization and excessive haste. He believed that the agenda should be determined in advance and announced to the various delegations to allow for preparation.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Paris, Broadcast on the 9th: At the meeting this afternoon, the Peace Conference again witnessed lengthy debate over the agenda. Vyshinsky argued for dividing the agenda into "various dispositions" and general matters, assigning the relevant agenda items to the secretariat and the conference. The Yugoslav representative proposed that to avoid lengthy and endless discussions, the agenda should be determined by the consent of the current chairman and the other chairmen. Spaak and Alexander both rose to speak in succession. Finally, Bidault stated that the agenda was drafted by the Secretary-General and that the matters to be discussed in the afternoon were usually a continuation of the unresolved issues from the morning meeting. Bidault's voice rose in pitch during his final remarks.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Paris, Broadcast on the 9th: At today's plenary session of the Peace Conference, Molotov once again proposed an amendment requesting the restoration of the two-thirds majority voting system. US Secretary of State Byrnes engaged in heated debate with representatives from Ukraine and Belarus. As a result, the conference rejected the amendment by a vote of 15 to 6 and accepted the British amendment, which divided the voting methods into two categories: the first being those passed by a two-thirds majority, which the four major foreign ministers must give full consideration; the second being those passed by a simple majority, which the four major foreign ministers should also consider, but with less weight than the first category. The Soviet Union and its supporting nations did not concede defeat and made new attempts to amend the procedures, but were ultimately rejected. The conference accepted the rules drafted by the Regulations Committee by a vote of 15 to 4, with two abstentions.</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 9th] At this morning's plenary session of the Peace Conference, the Soviet Union's proposal to restore the strict two-thirds majority voting rule was defeated by a vote of 15 to 6. The countries supporting the Soviet Union were Belarus, Ukraine, Czechoslovakia, Poland, and Yugoslavia.

<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] London, Broadcast on the 9th: A British Foreign Office spokesman stated: If a sudden event occurs in Iran that threatens the lives and property of British citizens, the United Kingdom will not be bound by consultations with the UN Security Council and will believe that it has reason to take "unilateral action." According to the Iranian government's statement yesterday, the Iranian government has protested the entry of Indian troops into Basra, Iraq, and demanded the withdrawal of the Indian troops. According to previous explanations by the British government, the deployment of Indian troops was to replace troops stationed near the British-Iranian oil fields in southern Iran.</p>
<h3 id="e41">The British Government Indicates It Will Not Relinquish Control of Palestine; Takes Measures to Prevent Illegal Jewish Immigration; Sets Up Jewish Refugee Camps on Cyprus <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 8th, United Press] The British Labour Party government's newspaper "Daily Herald" stated that the British government is preparing to submit the Palestine federal plan to the next UN General Assembly in New York for global discussion. The British cabinet has insisted that it will not relinquish the mandated territory of Palestine under any circumstances, and that even if the United States refuses to assist, the United Kingdom will do its best to complete the federal plan.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 9th] Reliable sources anticipate that the government will issue new plans by the end of the week regarding the control of illegal immigration to Palestine. Informed sources here believe that this plan is intended to prevent Jewish refugees from traveling from Italian seaports to Palestine and instead direct them to Cyprus, where British control is most readily achieved. However, a large number of Jewish refugees have already left Eastern Europe, mostly via the Romanian Black Sea, which is beyond the control of British forces. Therefore, this measure can only address a portion of the problem.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Nicosia, Cyprus, 8th] A battalion of British infantry arrived here today and will be stationed in Beharia. Furthermore, according to related sources, the first group of 500 Jewish refugees attempting to enter Palestine without legal documents will be relocated here tomorrow, and the second group of 2,000 will arrive next week.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Jerusalem, 8th] It is reported that the Jewish Agency has completed preparations for the reception of 100,000 Jewish immigrants. The Agency has purchased a military camp capable of accommodating 10,000 people from the US military stationed in France, which will be dismantled and transported to Palestine for installation. Since January of this year, the number of Jews who have arrived in Palestine without legal documents has reached 10,000, all of whom have found employment.</p>
<p>Arabs Refuse to Participate in Round Table Conference</p>
<p>[United Press, Jerusalem, 8th] Director of the Arab Office, Sulayman, declared that the Arabs are now eagerly awaiting Moscow's attitude toward the Palestine issue. The United States can intervene in Palestine, so why can't the Soviet Union? Sulayman's statement was made after the Chairman of the Supreme Arab Committee of Palestine, Husseini, rejected the British invitation to attend the London Round Table Conference.</p>

<p>Yoshida Reports to the Japanese Parliament</p>
<p>[United Press Tokyo, 9th] The Tokyo Daily News today published on its front page Prime Minister Yoshida's report to the Lower House Committee. He anticipates that the date for convening the peace conference with Japan may be earlier than generally rumored, possibly in May or June of next year. It is claimed that Yoshida said that Japan and all countries of the world are eager to end the post-war state as soon as possible, so that political, economic, industrial, and commercial activities can return to normal.</p>
<h3 id="e43">Far East International Tribunal: Ugaki's Memorial and Arita's Report Relate the Course of Seeking Peace with China. Tojo Once Issued Orders to Abuse Prisoners of War. Hashimoto's Writings from Years Ago Now Serve as Powerful Evidence. <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>[Kaizo-sha Tokyo, 9th] Today, the International Tribunal first presented Ugaki Kazushige's memorial submitted on September 21, 1938, and Arita Hachiro's report presented to the Privy Council meeting on November 29, 1938. Ugaki's memorial stated: "Between July and September 14, 1938, I discussed resolving Anglo-Japanese issues with the British Ambassador to Japan, strongly urging the British Ambassador to compromise with Japan and abandon the policy of aiding China. However, the British Ambassador insisted on quickly resolving Anglo-Japanese issues related to British interests in China, leading to a failure to reach an understanding between the two parties." Arita's report strongly asserted that Japan would not make peace with the Chinese government, stating that the Chinese government must abandon its policy of tolerating communism and resisting Japan, dissolve itself, and merge with the puppet regime before it could</p>
<p>consider peace, reaffirming the strengthening of the anti-communist axis of Japan, Germany, and Italy, and taking various measures against the Soviet Union to prevent its active participation in the incident. Next, a statement made by the defendant Sato Kenryo at a meeting of temporary police chiefs on August 25, 1938, was presented. At the time, Sato was the head of the press section of the Army Ministry and stated that the current incident had complex changes, so the war objectives were also unclear, and the war had deviated from its initial plan. Negotiations regarding the peace issue began in August 1937 through the German Ambassador, and in December, the Japanese side proposed conditions such as cooperation with Japan's "Manchukuo" anti-communist policy, the establishment of demilitarized zones, the conclusion of Sino-Japanese-Manchukuo economic agreements, and reparations, but the Chinese side did not respond. Therefore, the Japanese side held an imperial conference on January 11, 1938, and decided to adopt a</p>
<p>long-term war posture and declared that it would not treat the National Government as its opponent. As for foreign relations, the current conflict with the Soviet Union is actually disadvantageous, and if war is unavoidable, it should be after 1942. As for Britain, it recognizes some of its interests. Next, the minutes of the Privy Council meeting on December 2, 1938, were presented, outlining the process of Japan's opposition to the League of Nations. Next, a situation assessment report submitted by the Central China Expeditionary Army Headquarters to the Army Vice Minister Yamawaki on July 20, 1939, was presented, outlining various strategies for coping with a long-term war, and establishing a "New Central Government" with Wang Jingwei as its leader, actively promoting its development, strengthening its self-defense capabilities, and economically preventing third countries from assisting the central government, hindering the production and circulation of important military supplies and daily necessities in the mainland, and simultaneously continuing</p>
<p>to blockade the Yangtze River, striving to expel British influence in the Yangtze River basin, and actively working on the concessions, especially the Shanghai concession, anticipating that military force would be used for this purpose.</p>
<p>[United Press, Yokohama, 9th] Secondary Japanese war criminals are being tried here today. Also, Tojo, while serving as Minister of the Army, issued a notice to all concentration camps stating: "Do not misunderstand humanitarianism or be swayed by personal feelings towards prisoners of war. All prisoners of war must be strictly disciplined, and prisoners of war must be given the treatment they deserve, so that the Japanese people can recognize the excellent character of the Japanese nation and the special rights and honors enjoyed by the Japanese people.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 8th Dispatch] Excerpts from Hashimoto Kingoro's book "The Inevitability of Innovation" revealed his extreme joy when he drowned Chinese soldiers in the Yangtze River and his advocacy of expelling British and American influence from China to realize the expansionist plans of Japan. This summary has been submitted to the court as evidence against Hashimoto.</p>
<h3 id="e44">Plan to Invade Outer Mongolia <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>[United Press Tokyo, 9th] During the trial of Japanese war criminals today, evidence revealed that Tojo Hideki, the former Prime Minister who served as Vice Minister of the Army in the Konoe Cabinet in 1938, received a "top secret" order and plan. The Kwantung Army conducted military operations in Northeast China, invading the Outer Mongolian region under the sphere of influence of the Soviet Far East. The purpose of the plan was to conduct strategic actions against Outer Mongolia and to conduct actual surveys of the strategic geography of important areas along the Mongolian border, while studying the general materials already obtained, as well as natural resources. The Kwantung Army sent the plan to Tojo in Tokyo. Its origin was clearly due to the Kwantung Army's eagerness to advance north again, on the one hand to make the anti-communist zone in Outer Mongolia more stable, and on the other hand to collect geographical and strategic materials for future war against the Soviet Union.</p>
<h3 id="e45">Compensation Conference Convened, No Response from the Soviet Union Yet <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>[United Press Washington, 8th] According to some people in the Far Eastern Commission, the Soviet Union will try to prevent the U.S. plan to convene a compensation conference as soon as possible to dispose of Japanese assets. The Soviet Union intends to regulate the liquidation of industrial equipment moved from Northeast China last year. The Soviet Union has not responded to the U.S. suggestion that it would be best to convene the compensation conference in mid-August. It is expected that when the Far Eastern Commission holds a meeting on August 15, it will consider the responses of various governments, but the Soviet Union will not submit a response. These people believe that even if the Soviet Union submits a response, it will be necessary to demand that the scope of discussion at the compensation conference be limited to domestic assets in Japan and not involve foreign assets such as those in Northeast China. The Soviet Union can arbitrarily prevent any action from being taken by exercising the veto power stipulated in the Moscow Convention.</p>

<p>[Reuters London, 8th] Political figures in London are paying close attention to the meeting of the Executive Committee of the Indian National Congress held in Wardha, India, because whether the political deadlock in India can be broken depends on the decisions of the meeting.</p>
<p>[Reuters New Delhi, 8th] The Executive Committee of the Indian National Congress met in Wardha, Central Province, today, chaired by Nehru, for four hours, discussing the general political situation after the Muslim League rejected the Federal India plan proposed by the British Cabinet Mission.

<h3 id="e52">American Journalism Schools - The Pastoral Scenery of Missouri, the Hometown of President Truman <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>— Our newspaper's special correspondent in the United States, Mao Shuqing</p>
<p>(Continued from yesterday) Editorial professor Bai Langte, had lived in Tokyo for three years, his conversational skills were very good, and he remembered the names of Chinese students very well. He often helped students revise editorials, although his right hand was already suffering from rheumatism, he was still very energetic working beside the typewriter. Mr. Sharpe almost devoted his life to the journalism school, he was the editor-in-chief of the newspaper, he led students out to practice interviewing, came back to sort out the news, and revised headlines for the students, he was the most prestigious figure in the small town of Columbia, the residents not only knew him, but also respected him.</p>
<p>Columbia is too small, with a total of only 18,000 residents, two main streets, and a few small streets, that's all. The students probably feel the most pain in the interviewing class. They have to interview for news every day, and without news, they can't submit their assignments, so the birth of a son in one family and the death of a daughter in another family become their interview targets. Our group of four people arrived in Columbia from St. Louis and immediately became news targets, and the next day it was published in the "Missouri Newspaper." The newspaper school's library has a lot of books, including China's Central Daily News, Ta Kung Pao, Shen Bao, and Xinwen Bao. They have a complete set of the New York Times, and have compiled a very detailed "Index." There are many American female students in the Missouri Journalism School, most of them study advertising because studying advertising can earn more money. There are currently Xie Ranzhi, Zhang Xuesui, Wu Xiyuan, Zeng Meixia and Chen Mou and others among the Chinese students. In a recent scholarship thesis competition, Xie Ranzhi (formerly the president of Xinhu Bei Daily News in China) won second place in the entire school. Unfortunately, I didn't have time to visit</p>
<p>Missouri Agricultural College, there are several Chinese students studying agriculture in Missouri, and two studying economics. The day after we arrived, all the Chinese students invited us to lunch at a restaurant. In this quiet and remote city, a gathering of more than a dozen people seems to be a big deal. The car left Columbia the following afternoon. At the time of parting, I saw the six stone pillars of the University of Missouri, and had unspeakable reluctance. The six stone pillars stand in front of the general office of the University of Missouri. It is said that they are the remains of a major fire a long time ago. Now, the university authorities have specially published a booklet to "archaeologize" the six stone pillars. I didn't visit the two women's colleges in Columbia City (Christian Women's College and Stephens Women's College), which are both famous universities in Missouri. Another Westminster College, in Fulton City, southeast of Columbia, is where Churchill gave his speech on Anglo-American cooperation against the Soviet Union. It is said that the situation of the speech that day was indeed very vivid and intense. President Truman accompanied Churchill by car to Fulton, walking on the streets of Fulton, many of Truman's old friends shouted with rough hands and feet: "Harry! Harry!"</p>
<p>President Truman always smiled, waving his hat as he walked, and greeted his old friends in the countryside: "Hi! James", "Hello! Johnny", "Hi! Tom"! The Hi sounds kept coming. The president of a democratic country is inherently lovely, and a president from the countryside becomes even more lovely when he returns to the countryside. Truman's home is in Independence, Missouri, on the western end of Missouri, near Kansas City. Independence is not Truman's true hometown. His birthplace is in Grandview, thirteen miles from Kansas City. Truman farmed in Grandview in his childhood, so some Missourians still refer to him as a "cowherd," which was Truman's childhood. Later, he left farming and moved to Independence to work as a clerk in Kansas City. Before entering Kansas City, we took a detour to Independence, which is more than 100 miles from Columbia City. At a gas station, Deputy Consul Shen Zuogan asked the gas station attendant about the address of Truman's former residence. The gas station attendant said in a dashing manner: "This is not his home, it is where his mother lives." The car circled in the small streets and alleys of Independence, and finally</p>
<p>found a white clapboard house on Delaware Street. An American flag was firmly planted on the lawn in front of the house, and people who looked like secret police were wandering around guarding it. The people of Independence all know about the president's cottage. A western-style building in front of the house is the county senior high school, and a western-style building behind the house is the junior high school. We didn't stay in Independence for long, and entered Kansas City that evening. Overseas Chinese leader Cai Yiwu booked rooms for us at the Phillips Hotel. Kansas City is the center of the American land, it is a big city in the Midwest, although the name is Kansas, but most of the city still belongs to Missouri, and a small part belongs to Kansas. The two states are bounded by the Missouri River, with 400,000 residents east of the river and only 120,000 residents west of the river. The east side of the river is a prosperous commercial area, and the west side is a factory area. All in all, it is not as large as St. Louis, but the streets are clean, and the buildings are new, giving people a fresh feeling.</p>
<p>The climate in Kansas is particularly good. Although it is mid-summer, it is not as sultry as New York, nor as sticky as Chicago. Before Truman became a federal senator, he worked as a judge in Kansas City. Pandagongsi, one of the "giants" of the Democratic Party, who was the mayor at the time, appreciated Truman who had already become the master of the White House. Pandagongsi was reported for running gambling dens, embezzling money, and eventually died in prison. The people of Kansas all know these stories. A person in the same hotel pointed to a "Clark" hat shop next to the hotel and told me: "Look, this is the shop where Truman worked as a clerk." Every morning at 7:30, Truman would come out of his house and walk to this two-story hat shop." This was not long ago, and only a short time has passed, the mulberry field has become the sea, and the sea has become the mulberry field! (July 13, Kansas City)—End!</p>

<p>The German Internee Camp to Close Within the Coming Week</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] According to a message from the German Affairs Management Committee, the German internment camp is scheduled to close next Thursday. German internees who have a guarantor and report to the police station on the designated date to sign a written oath will be released. There are currently 47 German internees in the camp, 14 of whom are on "sick leave". It is reported that the reason for closing the internment camp is due to a lack of food. Another theory is that the Ministry of Education is eager to clear the camp site for the reopening of Tongji University.</p>

<h3 id="e65">Li Hongfei Testifies; Claims to Have Been Forced to Oversee Salt Transport <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Li Hongfei, Chairman of the "Central China Salt Industry Company," was tried in the High Court yesterday afternoon. Li stated that he was 59 years old and from Ningbo. Before the war, he worked in the salt affairs agency. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, he used the Xieji Trading Company to bid for the transportation of 1 million dan of salt from the Salt Affairs Administration. However, due to the fall of Nanjing and Shanghai, the Salt Affairs Administration moved west, so only over 40,000 dan were transported to Hankou. In the winter of the 28th year of the Republic (1939), he planned to use foreign ships to transport a large amount of Huai salt to provide food to the people of Hunan and Hubei. However, because correspondence with the Salt Affairs Administration was seized by the enemy, he was arrested by enemy soldiers on the second day of the first lunar month of the 29th year of the Republic (1940) and released after more than 60 days thanks to Zhou Fohai's intercession. Zhou then appointed him to positions such as Minister of Salt Industry and Director of the Salt Affairs Department, all of which he refused. In the third month of the 32nd year of the Republic (1943), because he was wanted, he took the position of Chairman of the "Central China Salt Transportation Company" and presided over the salt transport business. The company was established during the puppet Provisional Government era. Enemy shares accounted for five-tenths, puppet shares accounted for a little more than four-tenths, and commercial shares accounted for only a little less than one-tenth. The defendant held 100 shares, each worth 50 yuan. Although industrial salt was exported to Japan every month, it was all surplus salt from the domestic salt for the people's consumption, so the monthly export volume was unequal. The enemy's Ministry of Finance also had a price compensation company, which then paid the people. In the eleventh month of the 32nd year of the Republic (1943), the company was reorganized into the China Salt Industry Company, and the supply of industrial salt to the enemy was stopped and the enemy shares were withdrawn. Therefore, the defendant's appointment to the puppet position was actually forced. The court adjourned the case for further investigation.</p>
<h3 id="e66">Massive Dumping of Foreign Cigarettes Endangers Domestic Cigarette Industry; Labor and Management Hold Joint Meeting; Many Expressions of Pain; Everyone Calls for Cooperation and Improvement of Quality and Production <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Considering the impending crisis of the domestic cigarette industry due to the booming sales of foreign cigarettes, labor and management of the local cigarette industry held a joint meeting yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM at the Kangle Restaurant. Participants from the management side included more than 70 representatives from over 50 manufacturers. The labor side was represented by over 300 union representatives from various factories. In addition, over 30 reporters from various newspapers were invited to attend. Mayor Wu Guozhen, Lu Jingshi, Director of the Organization and Training Department of the Ministry of Social Affairs, Wang Xianqing, Xie Dahuang, and Zhou Peicheng, members of the executive committee of the Municipal Party Department, Zhu Xuefan, Chairman of the China Labor Association, and Lu Keming, Chairman of the General Labor Union, also attended the meeting. The atmosphere of the entire meeting was cordial and enthusiastic.</p>
<p>The joint meeting began at about 3:00 PM, with Zhou Xuexiang and Dai Gengxin (Chairman of Huacheng Tobacco Company), and Pan Mingxin (General Manager of Nanyang Tobacco Company) serving as the presidium. Zhou Xuexiang first reported on the significance of the joint meeting, saying: "Its main purpose is to promote labor-management cooperation and save the endangered cigarette industry. To awaken the labor and management sides of the cigarette industry to this crisis. Currently, factories cannot make money and workers' lives cannot be improved. The crux of the problem is not the issue of wages, but the booming sales of foreign cigarettes. Our production cannot compete with them, and our costs are higher than theirs. If this continues, the cigarette industry will be in danger of not being able to survive. Therefore, today, labor and management should stand on the same front and work hard to cooperate in production. At the same time, we hope that the government can restrict the import of foreign cigarettes and improve the quality of domestic cigarettes to fight against them." Zhou finally said: "Guangdong cigarette factories have been closing down one after another due to the booming sales of foreign cigarettes. If Shanghai counterparts cannot cheer up, they may also suffer the same fate." Dai Gengxin and Pan Mingxin also delivered speeches one after another, all hoping that labor and management can take the spirit of harmony of this joint meeting and work hard to cooperate.</p>
<p>Mayor Wu's Speech</p>
<p>The conference then invited Mayor Wu to give instructions. The Mayor said in warm applause: "Today I am speaking to the compatriots present, not just to the labor side or the management side, which shows that my mood is extremely excited and happy." He then gave examples to illustrate the harmonious labor-management relations in foreign industries, saying: "The old Mr. of the Hansay Chocolate Company in the United States has no family and no personal desires. All profits are completely used to improve labor welfare. In Japan, after the defeat, MacArthur allowed Japanese workers to raise wages, but the union representatives replied that it would be enough if they could have the same wages as before the war, and they did not want to increase them any further, because they deeply understood that today the tools and raw materials for production are both difficult to obtain. If wages are raised again, they will not be able to compete with the foreign goods sold at home and abroad. Therefore, the attitude of labor and management in our country today really needs to be improved." The Mayor then went on to elaborate on the points that labor and management should improve. He said: "First of all, management. In the past, management often did not treat labor as compatriots. Today, the cigarette industry can have close contact between labor and management and hold this harmonious joint meeting, breaking down the previous barriers, which is really commendable, this is one point. In the past, management's accounts have always been kept secret, and they have been strictly kept secret from the government and labor. This is an unnecessary ability. Management uses capital to seek considerable profits, what is the need to hide it, this is the second point. Personnel management should also be improved, and the use of people should be scientific, this is the third point. Speaking of labor, I also have a point of view for the labor side. If the factory closes down, the workers will also lose their jobs. Therefore, the workers and the factory's business are closely related. Why is American tobacco cheap? Because its wages are low and its work efficiency is high, while the efficiency of Chinese workers is not as high as that of the United States, and wages are more expensive than those in the United States. Therefore, the efficiency of Chinese workers should be improved. No matter what position they are in, they should first reflect on themselves. In this unprecedented crisis, management should think about how to be scientific, and labor should often think about how to increase the efficiency of their work. If they shirk each other's responsibilities, the factory will inevitably close down immediately and the workers will lose their jobs immediately."</p>
<h3 id="e67">Multiple Proposals Passed <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>Then, Lu Jingshi delivered a speech. Lu proposed the establishment of a factory labor-management conference to seek mutual understanding, so that disputes can be eliminated naturally. Subsequently, Wang Xianqing, Lu Keming, Xie Dahuang, and union representatives gave speeches one after another and immediately passed several proposals: (1) To telegraph the government to reduce the tax rate in order to reduce the cost of domestic cigarettes. (2) To telegraph the government to order tobacco producing areas to improve quality and production. (3) To telegraph all provinces and cities across the country to promote the "Citizens should smoke domestic cigarettes" movement to prevent leaks. (4) To organize the Shanghai Cigarette Industry Labor-Management Cooperation Promotion Committee. (5) To telegraph the government to raise import tariffs on cigarette products in order to maintain the national industry. (6) To plan to hold expanded domestic cigarette promotion in this city. The members of the Shanghai Cigarette Industry Labor-Management Cooperation Promotion Committee were also determined as follows: Management side: Lixing, Zhonghua, Yizhong, Dadong, Huaming, Dadongnan, Huacheng, Nanyang; Labor side: Nanyang Tobacco Workers' Union, Zhonghua Tobacco Workers' Union, Yizhong Tobacco Workers' Union, Huacheng Tobacco Workers' Union, First District Cigarette Workers' Union, Fifth District Tobacco Processing Union, Fourth District Cigarette Workers' Union. After the discussion was completed, the meeting adjourned at about 5:00 PM.</p>

<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Recently, there have been many thefts in the Pujiang area, which were found to be committed by the rogue "Thirty-Six Gang." Mayor Wu received several confidential reports and ordered the Municipal Police Bureau to arrest them. The Police Bureau dispatched detectives from the Criminal Police Detective Division to No. 7 Zengde Lane, Limalu, Nanshi, the day before yesterday, and arrested its leader, Xu Haoliang, and six of his "subordinates": Wei Jün, Le Amao, Lu Aliu, Zhou Tianxiang, and Zhao Heshang. They were taken to the bureau for interrogation. According to their confessions, they organized the "Wangye Company" during the enemy and puppet era, specializing in guarding the wharves and warehouses along the Pu River, and taking the opportunity to steal materials and sell them. Later, they organized the Shengji Transportation Company, and divided the spoils, with the workers getting 60% and the rest 40% for them. There are still many accomplices, and the Municipal Police Bureau is pursuing them.</p>

<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] After the Municipal Police Bureau ordered the ban on employing dance hostess managers in dance halls, the dance hostess managers panicked. They recently sent representatives to the Municipal Government to petition Mayor Wu. They claimed that they had never engaged in any despicable behavior such as exploiting dance hostesses, and therefore hoped that the authorities would take into account their livelihood and withdraw their order. However, the Municipal Government has authorized the Police Bureau with full authority regarding the ban on dance hostess managers, and the Police Bureau has no precedent for going back on its word, so this move by the dance hostess managers may be in vain.</p>

<p>[Our Paper's Report] The interrogation of all suspects in the Rong case was completed yesterday. The judgment is being drafted and will be announced after being reviewed and approved by the commander. Rong Desheng has submitted a written report detailing his kidnapping and escape. The military court will no longer insist on summoning Rong to court. It is understood that during the interrogation, the watch ticket suspect, Luo Weiquan, recanted his confession, denying that he was watching the medicine. He claimed that he was only a cook, so it was necessary to summon Rong Desheng to court to testify. Now that Rong is unable to come to court and the suspect has failed to provide other evidence, the military court will likely base its verdict on his original confession at the investigation office.</p>
<h3 id="e85">Forty Minutes Flying Over Shanghai <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>The C-46 type No. 38 passenger plane, crouching on the runway, was like an arrow fully drawn on a bow, ready to be launched. Its two 1250-horsepower engines roared against the headwind, the deafening noise growing more urgent and tense as the throttle increased. Peering out through the narrow glass window in front of the driver's seat, the 5,000-foot tawny runway looked like a vast springboard, leading to the endless horizon.</p>
<p>The sound of the propellers became so rapid that it seemed about to explode, and my heart felt as if it were tightly squeezed, unable to breathe.</p>
<p>Chief pilot Chen Wenhui and co-pilot Ji Mei re-examined the complex instruments one last time and exchanged a silent "O.K." Chen then gently pushed the control panel forward, and I felt a slight bump. The "tawny springboard" receded rapidly behind us – we were taking off.</p>
<p>I hurriedly looked at my watch; the time was 11:25. Looking back to the left out of the window, there were hangars, planes, more hangars, and more planes... all rushing past like the wind. There was no time for me to think, and the ground was sinking, sinking, sinking below. Trees, houses, temples, rivers, and the boats in the rivers were all shrinking bit by bit.</p>
<p>Each time my heart twinged slightly, I felt the plane rise upward. My eyes were fixed on the altimeter, watching the long needle move from three to four to five hundred feet. We were already over Pudong.</p>
<p>At this point, Chen gently rotated the control panel, and his right foot lightly tapped the right pedal. The horizon below the wing tilted to the right, and I realized that the plane was turning to the left, heading towards downtown Shanghai.</p>
<p>The Huangpu River, running from south to north, reappeared around 11:35. Looking down, this great river looked like a winding mud ditch. The scattered freighters, oil tankers, and sailboats moored on the river looked like models scaled down from their actual size. In just five minutes, I could see the blocks-like high-rise buildings on the Bund: the clock on top of the Jianghai Customs House, and the square, dazzlingly white Central Bank Building, all swept past below the left side of the plane. So small, so small! In the past, when I walked beneath it, it looked down on me with pride. Today, it was just like a child's building block, disappearing beneath my feet.</p>
<p>The tense strings in my heart had long since loosened. In the fifty-odd-foot-long iron belly of the plane, I looked back and forth, as happy as a child. How cool and relaxed the air was! Flying in the sky was truly freedom, so peaceful and stable. I temporarily forgot the suffocation and annoyance of the ground.</p>
<p>The No. 38 plane was fixed at an altitude of 650 feet, smoothly following a grey-tinged road, tilting to the right to make a 180-degree turn, skimming over the Huangpu River, and then flying back towards Pudong. Circling around from Pudong, we flew over the Bund again so that Mr. Gu's camera would have ample time to capture the island scenery of Shanghai.</p>
<p>On the return flight, chief pilot Chen Wenhui continuously pulled the control panel backward, and the plane rose steadily, ascending to 1,000 feet. The speedometer read "160 miles per hour." But I couldn't get any sense of speed. After passing Avenue Joffre, the throttle was turned down, and the altitude quickly decreased. When we descended to two or three hundred feet, the tawny runway reappeared in front of the plane. I immediately regained that sense of speed that caused a slight dizziness. The pointer of the altimeter rapidly retreated to zero, and without realizing it, the landing gear came to rest on the ground.</p>
<p>At 12:05, I returned to the ant-like world of contention. (Shen Shi)</p>

<h3 id="e86">Shanghai-Nantong Route Passenger Ship "Hangli" Robbed at Liuhekou; Passengers Lost Over Ten Million, Cook Shot <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>[Our Paper's Report] The Zhonghang Company's "Hangli" vessel, weighing 200 tons, operates between Shanghai, Nantong, and Renjiagang, making round trips every other day. On the 8th, at 6:20 AM, the ship, loaded with passengers and cargo, weighed anchor from Shanghai. There were approximately 280 passengers on board, along with 50 unarmed soldiers. At 7:30, it exited the Wusong estuary and headed north. The weather was clear, and the sailing was smooth, with Captain Li Yuqing personally in command. At about 9:00, when the ship reached the Jiangmian River north of the South Stone in Liuhekou, a man in a black suit holding a Mauser pistol suddenly broke in. Captain Li told him that this was the ship's bridge and asked him to rest in the passenger cabin. Unexpectedly, two more men came in, each drawing Mauser pistols. They told Li that they were guerrillas, numbering more than 30, and had come to borrow some food and supplies. Li was then put under guard by the bandits. At that time, one of the bandits fired a shot into the river. The engine room was forced to stop, and the other bandits, who had been lying in wait, began to search the passengers. On the upper deck, a female passenger was wearing two gold bracelets and two gold rings. The bandits ordered her to take them off, but she refused. The bandits fired a shot at the deck as a warning, and the gold ornaments were still snatched away. Unexpectedly, when the bullet pierced the deck and shot downwards, it hit the cook, Zhu Amao, in three places: the right shoulder, waist, and leg. While the robbery was taking place, a China Merchants Bureau "Jiangli" vessel was being launched, and the bandits mistook it for a warship and became very flustered. Later, a small boat came to their aid. After one of the bandits sounded the alarm, they all fled the ship and sailed away to the northeast. After the shipowner checked the losses, it was found that 1.2 million yuan in cash from the accounting room, including 280,000 yuan sent by a Renjiagang warehouse, had been stolen. Most of the passengers' losses were gold ornaments, and not much cash, worth about 10 million yuan in total. The biggest loss was a single peddler, who had 24 bolts of silk yarn, all of which were stolen. At that time, because there were injured people on board, the captain planned to turn back to Shanghai for medical treatment. However, because the passengers' cash had been stolen, they had no money for accommodation if they returned to Shanghai, so they all demanded to continue north. The shipowner, unable to refuse the wishes of the majority, continued to Renjiagang. The ship returned to Shanghai on time yesterday afternoon. After arriving in Shanghai, Zhu Amao, who had been injured, was sent to Renji Hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3 id="e87">Letter to the Editor <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>Respected Editor: I have read the article in your newspaper on the 8th entitled "On Roads Zhizhou and Zhengjiang, People are Shot to Death and Injured". After investigation, it appears that the facts are somewhat different. Last night (the 7th), in front of the Zhijiang Theater, military police were abusing and humiliating officers of our headquarters. Our police officers passed by and intervened to protect the abused officers, resulting in a conflict. The military police used their weapons to attack, and one pistol was taken away from our police officers. This was immediately reported to Captain Zhu of that team, who in turn reported it to our battalion. In order to prevent the situation from escalating, I immediately ordered all companies to close their gates and prohibit entry and exit, and led Captain Zhu with the pistol to the military police headquarters to explain the misunderstanding and return the weapon. At the gate of the Second Company, we encountered Military Police Platoon Leader Wu leading over 20 armed military police officers who had already ambushed the front of the Second Company. I personally apologized to the military police, urged them to stop, and asked the platoon leader to come to the battalion headquarters to resolve the misunderstanding and return the pistol. Unexpectedly, the armed military police at the gate illegally arrested the squad leader of our Second Company in front of the Second Company. When the sentry of our Second Company rushed to the military police and demanded his release, the military police opened fire, instantly killing two of our police officers (who died one after another due to serious injuries). Seeing the disaster they had caused, the military police scattered. At that time, the officers and soldiers of our battalion did not retaliate in order to prevent the situation from escalating. Otherwise, with over 600 armed police officers in our battalion, if we had counterattacked, those few military police officers would not have been able to escape so easily, and Platoon Leader Wu would have been killed on the spot. In addition to reporting the matter to higher authorities by telegram, I would like to state that the newspaper's report of both sides opening fire does not reflect the facts. Please make a correction. Sincerely, Li Mingen, Commander of the Independent Police First Battalion of the Northeast Railway Police Headquarters.</p>

<p>Limited to Those Without Nationally Designated Editions</p>
<p>[Zhenjiang News] The selection of textbooks for secondary schools in Jiangsu is causing much confusion. Because the Suzhou Mingbao newspaper on July 21st mistakenly published a news item stating that the Jiangsu Department of Education had designated the use of several reviewed editions, it caused quite a stir. Yesterday, our reporter interviewed a spokesperson from the Department of Education regarding this matter. According to him, the Department of Education has never issued any official documents designating the use of textbooks for secondary schools. He also said that all books compiled in accordance with the new curriculum standards issued by the Ministry of Education can be freely adopted by each school. On August 5th, this newspaper's Education section published a news article entitled "Jiangsu Province Formulates Supply Methods for Primary and Secondary School Textbooks," which explained in detail that each school is temporarily allowed to freely adopt the reviewed editions of various publishing houses for subjects in junior high school and above that do not have nationally designated editions. This proves that the Department has not designated any secondary school textbooks.</p>

<p>Since the administration of customs and practices was transferred to the Social Affairs Bureau, and military service preferences were taken over by the Civil Affairs Department, internal operations have undergone slight changes, and all personnel have also been readjusted. The senior officials announced by the Municipal Government yesterday include Commissioner Jin Liangben, Section Chief of the First Section Li Xue, and Section Chief of the Third Section Chen Wuxing (the Section Chief of the Second Section remains the same), totaling three people. It is also rumored that the position of secretary will be taken by Li Yuan.</p>

<p>Since Mr. Ye Zhenquan was elected chairman of the District People's Representative Assembly of the Fourth District in this city, he has spared no effort in promoting the work of the assembly. It is learned that the assembly has decided to convene its first representative assembly from August 25th to 26th to discuss matters related to reform within the district. It is heard that notices have been issued to each representative and public announcements have been posted to broaden public opinion. It is expected that there will be a heated discussion during the meeting.</p>
<h3 id="e113">Residents of the Eighth Block of the Second District Self-Fund the Repair of Pingwang Street <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>Pingwang Street in the Eighth Block of the Second District has been in disrepair for a long time, and the road surface is uneven. After it rains, there are places where water accumulates. Therefore, the block chief, Hua Wenqing, and others initiated a self-funded repair project. After submitting a request to the District Office and the Bureau of Public Works for contact, the required expenses of over 600,000 were automatically donated by the residents of the block. The project is contracted by the Bureau of Public Works and has started today.</p>
<p>The Second District Office of this city held its third district affairs meeting at 3 PM on the seventh (the day before yesterday), presided over by District Chief Li Ruchun. There was a detailed discussion on simplifying the handling of official documents and the attendance of staff. It is also planned to organize a roving supervisory team to regularly supervise the offices of each block to achieve work results.</p>
<h3 id="e114">Seventeenth District Repairs Bridges <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>The Linping Road Bridge in the Seventeenth District (North Sichuan Road) is an important transportation hub. Affected by years of war, it has suffered great damage and is in danger of collapsing, urgently requiring repair. In addition, the Gujiawan Bridge was demolished by the enemy and puppets and has not yet been rebuilt, causing inconvenience to pedestrians. The District Office, at the request of local residents, sent personnel to investigate and confirmed the facts. It has already submitted a special report to the Bureau of Public Works to separately survey and repair it to facilitate transportation.</p>
<p>Also, the population of the Third Block of the Seventeenth District has increased sharply, reaching 61 jia and 1,677 households, exceeding the original standard of 30 jia per block by too much, making it inconvenient to carry out block affairs. The District Office has already submitted a report to the Municipal Government for approval to divide the Third Block into two blocks and is now preparing an expanded compilation table and a colored map of the divided blocks for review.</p>
<h3 id="e115">Private Real Estate Transactions Require Certification by Autonomous Organizations <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>Suggestion from the District People's Representative Assembly of the Third District</p>
<p>The District People's Representative Assembly of the Third District (Yumiao) believes that private real estate transactions in this city have never been certified by autonomous organizations. Whenever disputes arise and lawsuits are filed in court, when the local autonomous organization is required to provide impartial certification, it is difficult to provide evidence due to a lack of understanding of the situation. It is also impossible to investigate and defend, and there is no basis for a reply. This situation should be remedied and is essential. Therefore, it is proposed that in the future, land and housing transactions must be certified by the district block before they can be transferred. The district block personnel live in the same neighborhood as each household and have a deep understanding of the private secrets of the people. They can clearly understand who owns the property. When it is necessary to provide certification, bias can be avoided. Moreover, abuses such as selling with false identification and reselling the same property multiple times can be reduced. Therefore, the proposal that private real estate transactions should be certified by autonomous organizations was submitted to the first District People's Representative Assembly meeting of the district. The proposal was passed and submitted to the Municipal Government for approval.</p>
<h3 id="e116">Thirty-Second District Distributes Flour Regularly <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>The Thirty-Second District (Zhenru) convened a meeting at the District Office at 9 AM yesterday to distribute relief flour. It was originally planned to distribute it on the same day, but because the district will hold the election of municipal senators on the 11th and is busy with preparations, it cannot be completed in time. Therefore, it was changed to complete the distribution in the district before the 16th.</p>
<p>The Thirty-Second District will elect municipal senators tomorrow and has selected Guanlong Elementary School, Zhenru Elementary School, Yangjiaqiao Pengcheng Branch School, the bridgehead at No. 1 Zhenbei Road, and Huaxia Elementary School as polling places. The Municipal Government's Civil Affairs Department has also sent five election supervisors to supervise the elections at each polling place. All impartial gentry and district people's representatives in the district will be present to assist in order to show solemnity.</p>

<h3 id="e118">Heavy Interest on Loans and Excessive Expenses High-Interest Loans Also Cannot Be Supported Pawnbroking Industry Still Has 760 Businesses <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Pawnbroking was originally one of the financial institutions that regulated the finances of commoners. Therefore, all business facilities are ultimately aimed at meeting the welfare of the people. However, after the war, with the soaring prices of all goods, the business of general pawnbroking also changed rapidly. The pawn period was shortened daily, and the pawn interest increased daily. The situation became even worse during the occupation of the enemy and puppets. Illegal small pawnshops in disguise sprang up everywhere. The pawn period was shortened to one month, and the pawn interest was as high as five cents or more. After the victory, the pawn and pawnshop industries in this city were ordered to establish a reorganization committee. After active preparations, the Pawnbroking Commercial Guild was officially established on March 5th of this year. After the establishment of the guild, the pawn and pawnshop industries have been merged into one.</p>
<p>Two Months for Maturity First Month 4 Cents and 6</p>
<p>Months ago, the industry stipulated that the pawn period should be uniformly two months, with a grace period of five days. The pawn interest was 2.7 cents per yuan per month, the storage fee was 4 cents, and the handling fee was 1.5 cents, for a total of 4.6 cents. However, the handling fee is only charged once in the first month, and not counted thereafter, so the total for the second month is 3.1 cents. On average, the interest and expenses per yuan per month for two months are approximately slightly less than 4 cents.</p>
<p>At this time, when high-interest loans are prevalent, some say that the current standard of interest taken by the pawnbroking industry is also a kind of high-interest loan, and it is necessary to increase crackdown. The reporter specifically asked the competent department of the Social Affairs Bureau about this matter. According to the reply: The Social Affairs Bureau has long paid attention to the current interest-taking method of the pawnbroking industry. As far as the department is concerned, it hopes that the industry will adjust the current interest-taking standard. This matter is also felt to be necessary within the industry itself. And is willing to reduce the monthly interest per yuan to 2.5 cents, the storage fee remains the same at 4 cents, and the handling fee is changed to 7 cents per month. According to the person in charge, the industry regulations originally did not have explicit provisions for the handling fee item, and it should have been cracked down on. However, in order to take care of the livelihood of the pawnbroking staff, who rely on handling fees as an important part of their monthly income, it is still retained.</p>
<p>Retaining Handling Fee Reduced to 3 Cents and 6</p>
<p>After this adjustment, the interest and expenses per yuan per month have been reduced to 3.6 cents. The industry association is currently drafting a report for submission to request adjustment, which is expected to be approved and implemented soon. According to the person in charge's estimation, the interest on general bank loans before the war was only 7 or 8%, while the interest and expenses of pawnbroking at that time totaled 2 cents and some change. It was approximately 130 to 150% higher than the fixed interest of banks. Now, the interest on general loans has reached 1.5 or 1.6 cents. And this time, the pawnbroking industry is willing to reduce the interest and expenses to 3.6 cents. According to the proportion of the increasing interest on bank loans, this reduction in pawn interest is still considered reasonable. In the future, the Social Affairs Bureau will consider the actual situation and gradually reduce the pawn interest to maintain the livelihood of the commoners.</p>
<p>The reporter then visited several people in the pawnbroking industry to inquire about the recent situation of the industry. It is learned that the pawnbroking industry has been repeatedly affected by currency changes, soaring prices, and high dark interest since the outbreak of the war. Every time the currency system changes, the capital of the pawnbroking industry shrinks invisibly. Before the war, a small pawnshop operating with 10,000 yuan could cope with the situation quite comfortably. Now, after eight years of the War of Resistance and two changes of currency system, this capital of 10,000 yuan has almost disappeared. In addition, with prices soaring again and again, taking valuables from borrowers with increasingly shrinking limited capital is no less than being attacked from both sides.</p>
<p>Capital Too Weak All Businesses Changed Careers</p>
<p>During periods of soaring prices, it is often the case that when borrowers pawn items and when they prepare funds to redeem the goods several months later, the items seem to have soared several times in price. Therefore, even with a high interest rate of 5 cents, it is not enough to compensate for the devaluation of the currency. For this reason, in recent years, it has been impossible for general normal pawnbroking businesses to maintain their original capital, let alone make a profit. Furthermore, according to the general situation of the pawnbroking industry, the majority of the "jia ben" (i.e., the total amount of pawned loans) is borrowed from relatives, friends, or various merchants. The interest on these borrowed funds is mostly above 2 cents. Therefore, the interest cost of borrowed funds is already high, and adding the necessary expenses for the business itself, the pawn interest cannot be lowered. Today, of the 760 pawnbroking businesses in the city, 90% are invested and operated by people outside the industry. And the original operators have mostly been eliminated due to the above-mentioned reasons. Of the hundreds of businesses currently operating, the vast majority have capital below one million yuan. However, the "jia ben" varies greatly, ranging from only several hundred thousand to more than 20 million yuan. However, those with extremely high "jia ben" are extremely rare.</p>
<p>Only One or Two Tickets per Day Already Tastes Like Difficulty</p>
<p>According to the current situation of storefronts, pawnbroking businesses with only one or two tickets per day are everywhere. Some even guard all day without a single ticket coming in. On the one hand, the interest on borrowed funds and all operating expenses still have to be paid. Therefore, people in the industry all say that the current stage of the pawnbroking industry is like a chicken rib. The only hope is that the business can improve again, then it can still be maintained. Otherwise, the future of the pawnbroking industry will probably be bleak.</p>
<h3 id="e119">Gold Note Trading Flat <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>The red market was even more mediocre yesterday. It opened flat in the morning. After opening, it once rose from 1.915 million to 1.925 million, but there were not many transactions. The buying momentum stopped there. The Central Bank distributed 4 or 5 bars at a price of 1.9175 million. After 10 o'clock, it fell back to 1.913 million and then stagnated. At noon, it hovered between 1.915 million and 1.92 million. In the afternoon, the asking price still showed weakness. As a result, it closed slightly lower by 4,000 compared to the previous session. Gold ornaments, silver bullion, and silver dollars all lacked movement. The supply and demand of gray market money was balanced, and gray market interest rates ranged from 1 cent to 1.3 cents.</p>
<p>Foreign currency US dollars remained extremely sluggish. At the beginning of the morning, the price was around 2,515 yuan, and it rose slightly to 2,530 yuan midway, which increased the supply. At noon, it struggled around 2,520 yuan. In the afternoon, it weakened slightly, and the demand for supply was still low, to the point of being mediocre. Those who store foreign currency moved to Hong Kong dollar activities, which led to this. As a result, it closed slightly lower by 10 yuan compared to the previous session. The supply of Hong Kong dollar chips was surprisingly scarce, and it alone showed stability. As a result, it closed slightly higher by 2 yuan compared to the previous session. The exchange rate for Hong Kong dollars was 550 yuan to 555 yuan, the exchange rate for Indian rupees was 663 yuan to 68 yuan, and the exchange rate for British pounds was 8,850 yuan to 9,000 yuan. Trading was slightly more active, which made the US dollar market appear cold and inactive.</p>

<p>Yesterday, a total of more than 8,900 dan of rice arrived in the north and south markets. High-quality japonica rice was firm. Medium and low grades continued to rise by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan due to the strong demand from retailers. The supply and demand of indica rice was relatively balanced. High-quality goods were slightly scarce. Medium and secondary station rice was in short supply, and new products were pending. Retail sales were still acceptable, and prices rose by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. New japonica rice arrivals were not many. The weather was hot, and rice porridge sales were brisk, rising by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. Flour retailers were active but not strong. Factory prices stepped down slightly and followed the decline. Prices continued to weaken by 100 to 200 yuan. The situation was still lacking in spirit and it was difficult to prosper. Miscellaneous brands traded sparsely. There was still continued sale of foreign flour, and the quality was very good. Wheat customer cargo was active but not strong. Only Quanzhou in Fujian took a small amount. Qingdao gangs still picked white wheat. The market trend was weak, with price decreasing by 300 to 500 yuan. Factories lacked transactions due to the daily decline in flour prices. Bran also followed the decline by 100 to 200 yuan. Soybean consumption declined and oil factories' purchases were weak. New sources of supply continued. Prices continued to decline by another 500 to 1,000 yuan. Broad beans were being sold off at reduced prices. Sales of raw kernels were sluggish. Although the owners were firm, the rare trading made the market trend obviously weak and secretly declining. The retail sales in the oil market were still active. Arrivals of raw oil were not many. Sales were dry and brisk, and prices rose by 1,000 yuan. Factories continued to supply soybean oil and the trend was standing up. Rapeseed oil rose slightly by 500 to 600 yuan. A small amount of soybean oil came from the northeast and Longhai Line ports. The later situation was not overly inflated. Countryside consumption of soybean cake was increasingly weak. Arrivals came from Hankou and Yingkou. The market was not prosperous and declined by another 200 to 300 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e121">Pig Bristle Exports First Improve Quality Next Reduce Costs <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>Only 200 dan of pig bristles from Hankou and Shanghai were traded this month for export. Sichuan bristles were unmoved. According to industry insiders, the key to pig bristles in the future is not the changes in prices in foreign markets, but improving quality to maintain the market. If foreign prices are better but the quality is poor, it is useless. The second is to reduce costs. If convenient transportation, tax exemptions, and changes to the dock cannot be achieved, reducing costs is impossible. The current quality has been greatly improved. The fullness of Sichuan bristles has exceeded 95%, Hankou bristles have reached 70%, and Shanghai bristles have also reached 40%, all of which meet foreign needs. The US government has a large inventory, estimated at 9.9 million pounds. There are also news of sales, so the sales of Chinese pig bristles in the United States are slightly affected. The UK has never needed a large quantity, and its style is to hold on. People in the industry are not interested in transactions with the UK.</p>
<p>On the 3rd of this month, 200 boxes of Sichuan bristles were transported east from Chongqing by the Minsheng Company's Minxiang Wheel. There were still arrivals one after another. The 2,700 dan of Sichuan bristles stored here were sorted out and shipped out in July, and another 900 dan were being sorted out and could be shipped out in the short term.</p>

<p>The rayon market gradually stabilized yesterday. 120 type Tian opening had a price of 1.55 million yuan, and quickly rose to 600,000 yuan. The closing price was 610,000 yuan, 20,000 yuan higher than the previous afternoon. The market price in the afternoon did not change much. The price of 120 type miscellaneous brand was also 10,000 yuan higher. The prices of other types of goods were called up to the original market price of the previous day. Most of them were never traded. The factory and merchant market was quiet. There were some transactions for users. The price of five dan of ordinary goods ranged from 1.8 million to 1.9 million yuan, and another dan was priced at 1.7 million to 1.75 million yuan. No transactions were heard for dry merchants. The prices of silk goods were mostly stable without any ups and downs. Huajin crepe was in greater demand than supply, and the price rose by another 50 yuan yesterday.</p>

<p>The yarn market was more peaceful than usual yesterday. 20s saw ups and downs in each brand and trading was still extremely light. Only Tianjin gangs bought a small amount of Red Chief Star and other medium-sized yarn. The sales on the Beijing-Shanghai line were sluggish, and the sale of small yarn was particularly blocked. The Textile Construction Company opened yarn as usual at noon, with a total of 30 kinds ranging from 1s to 80s. The listed price was not much different from the previous period.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the New York US cotton telegraph suddenly soared by more than 130 points. The near-term price of US dollars was 35.86, and the new flower far-term price was 32.78. The Middling spot price broke the previous peak price (36.47) and opened at 36.66. Spot cotton trading in this port was still smooth. Shenxin Third Factory and Xinsheng Fu'an Dacheng and other factories purchased it. Stimulated by the soaring price of US cotton, the market price rose by another 2,000 to 3,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Grey cloth continued to increase, V Dragon Head was particularly popular. Civil-run Dapeng, Dangui, and Southern's demand were prosperous. The prices above all rose by more than 1,000 yuan. Shilin cloth gradually improved, but serge remained in a fatigued situation.</p>

<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Zhongnan Youxian Company enjoys a good reputation in this place and has decided to increase its capital and move to Shanghai in order to expand its business.

<p>Recently, since the Swedish ship "Bali" loaded over 7,000 boxes of Chinese tea and sailed from this city overseas, exporters have been busy with all the procedures. As a result, their interest in purchasing has somewhat slackened. In the whole city, only Jardine Matheson and Wu Chang, two Chinese tea companies, have together taken in less than 1,000 boxes of Taiwan black tea, aged medium grades, aged lower grades, small-leaf black tea, and aged needle-leaf tea. However, the process remains very stable. It is reported that there is demand from European and American countries for Fujian small-leaf tea and aged "Chou Zhen" tea, but prices are not generous enough, making it difficult to sell them for the time being. As for domestic sales of black and green tea, they have not shown any signs of decline. "Bao Zhong" flower tea is particularly popular in Yingkou, Shandong, and other places, rising to 72,000-73,000 yuan per dan. Other varieties are consistently firm.</p>
<h3 id="e127">Overbought Positions Released, Major Players Actively Enter, Wing On Shares Trade Most <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese stock market situation is abnormal. A major player has vigorously entered Wing On shares, buying no less than 3 million shares. However, because the bulls in the industry are profiting and taking gains, supply and demand are roughly equal, preventing a dramatic rise. Overbought positions are too crowded, and there was a sudden sell-off at noon, causing a widespread decline. At one point, high-priced Wing On shares were at 723 yuan, Mei Ya at 4150 yuan, Jingfu and Xinguang both at 240 yuan, and Qinxing at 172 yuan. Less popular small and medium-sized stocks had already opened lower and gradually declined. Old shares were also weak and unable to rise, repeatedly seeing lower prices. Judging from the situation, there is still a sense of being top-heavy. All closed at low prices at noon, with Wing On shares down 5 yuan compared to the previous close, Mei Ya down slightly at 180 yuan, Jingfu and Xinguang already at break-even, and Qinxing also down more than half a percent. Less popular small and medium-sized stocks were down about half a percent each. There was no lack of supply for old shares, and many were seen at lower prices. After the close, Wing On shares continued to be bid lower in the over-the-counter market.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks did not trade much. Popular stocks are still struggling. Jardine Matheson initially reached 8200, but quickly faltered and returned to the previous closing price. Small stocks showed a slight recovery due to some short covering and a stable trend. As a result, Jardine Matheson and British American Tobacco closed flat compared to the previous close, and the others showed slight gains.</p>

<p>[Our Report] The Securities Exchange Subcommittee's work of examining broker qualifications has now come to an end. The Securities Exchange Preparatory Committee was originally scheduled to convene a full preparatory committee meeting at 9:00 AM yesterday. However, due to President Song's visit to Shanghai and the Bank Association's meeting, many committee members were unable to attend, so the meeting was rescheduled to 9:00 AM this morning. It is said that the committee will review the subcommittee's audit process and determine the number of qualified brokers, with some suggesting that it may be reduced to 200. Approval from the ministry is expected next week. Also, starting today, the Listed Securities Examination Subcommittee will begin examining the listing securities applications that have already been submitted (reportedly more than 30 types). Meanwhile, it will continue to accept applications from various companies, so that they can be submitted to the ministry for approval and announced together before the securities exchange opens.</p>

<p>Sugar Prices Slightly Firmer</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market trend turned firmer. Shantou's "Ti Qing", high-grade goods were at 94,000 yuan, extra high-grade at 95,000-96,000 yuan, and "Ban Nan Qing" at 91,000-92,000 yuan, with over 200 bags transacted. Cotton red was at 123,000 yuan for 30 bags. Jianbang's "Kai Bai Bao", "Diao Qing" was at 90,000 yuan for 50 bags, and the next grade at 89,000 yuan. Xinghua's "Kai Zhong Zhuang Gong Fen Bai" was at 128,000 yuan, and "Xing Chi" at 115,000-116,000 yuan, with over 60 bags transacted.</p>
<p>Domestic Bonds Slightly Up</p>
<p>A major player on the fifth floor of the public bond market switched from Grade E to Grade C, resulting in a situation where Grades A, B, and C were flat, while Grades D and E were weaker. When the market opened in the morning, Domestic Bond C opened flat. A firm on the seventh floor slightly sold off, dropping to a low of 600 yuan mid-session, before bargain hunters stepped in to stabilize the market at noon. As a result, Grades A and B closed flat compared to the previous close, Domestic Bond C was up 20 yuan, Grade D was up slightly by 20 yuan, and Domestic Bond E was down 50 yuan.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Brussels, 9th] Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg are organizing a joint international trade group. A joint secretariat has been established in Brussels, along with three committees, one of which is the Customs Committee. It is working to draft a customs tariff for the three countries to jointly abide by. After being passed by the parliaments of the three countries, a customs union will be formed on November 1st of next year. There will be no tariff barriers between the three countries, and they will form a single unit for the rest of the world.</p>

<p>Total Amount is 75 Million</p>
<p>Xinhua Department Store held a shareholders' meeting at the YMCA yesterday, presided over by General Manager Li Yan[illegible]. The issue of increasing capital was discussed and it was resolved to increase the original capital of 7.5 million yuan to 75 million yuan (i.e., increasing each share by nine shares). The company operates the Xinhua Underwear Factory, the Xiongdi Chemical Industry Factory, the Hongmian Sock Factory, and the Xinkang Office, and is very developed.</p>
<h3 id="e132">Implied Prohibition Through Taxation: Eating and Playing Are Allowed, As Long As Tax Obligations Are Met <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>When you smoke an American cigarette, do you know its cost? Let me tell you, the cost to a cigarette merchant for ordering a pack of 20 Marlboro cigarettes from the United States is 7 US cents. Assuming an exchange rate of 2,500 yuan, the cost is only 175 yuan, but the import tax paid to customs is 250% of the purchase price.</p>
<p>That is 437 yuan and 50 cents.</p>
<p>Domestic cigarettes have a factory tax, which is 100%. Beer also has a factory tax of 200%, as does local wine. This is of course a restriction on tobacco and alcohol, or perhaps it can be said to be an implied prohibition through taxation. But other industries also often have to pay a large amount of taxes and fees. For example, in Shanghai's restaurant industry, the various tax obligations they bear from the time they open a business are as follows:</p>
<p>Business license tax (taxed by grade)</p>
<p>Business tax (1.5 per thousand)</p>
<p>Income tax (3 per thousand)</p>
<p>Excess profits tax</p>
<p>Banquet tax (20 out of 120)</p>
<p>Among them, the banquet tax is the most substantial. Those with music and dance floors are also calculated as dance halls and cafes, with a tax rate of 30 out of 130. If you drink a bottle of beer or eat a cup of ice cream, there is also a liquor tax or cold drink license fee added. Of the 400 small noodle restaurants in the city, 500 are exempt from the banquet tax. The remaining 500 or so members of the Restaurant Industry Association are all subject to taxation, even those who specialize in set meals and rice dishes. (Because they sometimes serve cold appetizers and stir-fries, which are said to be eaten by rich people and should be taxed.)</p>
<p>Don't underestimate this small banquet tax. The city government's largest source of revenue relies on it. Revenue in July, according to published figures, reached 1.5 billion yuan, ranking first among municipal revenue. The city's entertainment tax is the second largest figure, exceeding 1.3 billion yuan. It is collected on ticket prices for movies, dramas, Peking operas, etc. The tax rate was previously 50% of the ticket price, but was reduced to 40% in August (for August only). So when you buy a 1,500 yuan theater ticket and enter the cinema, you can rest assured, because one-third of it has already fulfilled your responsibility as a small citizen to the city government.</p>

<h3 id="e133">On the Yangzhou-Taizhou Line, Trip to Northern Jiangsu (II) <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>— Our Correspondent, Hangzhou, Yangzhou Dispatch, 4th</p>
<p>The luxurious shadow of ancient Yangzhou has disappeared in the ruthless ages; now, it is a military city.</p>
<p>Fortresses are built high at the city gate, and the guarding soldiers’ machine guns are observing the front, with no [illegible]. Pedestrians must accept strict inspections.</p>
<p>The Communist army is on the offensive in northern Jiangsu, and Yangzhou is under their menacing gaze. The good residents entrust everything to the National Army that defends them. They trust the strength of the National Army and obey military management. This city gains stability in tension.</p>
<p>However, stability cannot hide desolation and misery. The hotel where the reporter stayed has more than 300 rooms, but only three people are staying there now. The doors of the stores are open, and there are quite a few goods on display, but only clerks are seen dozing off behind the counters. The number of people has not decreased, but has increased; what has increased are the refugees in tattered clothes who have been “struggled” out, making Yangzhou even more miserable.</p>
<p>The total data on refugees is 40,000. These people have replaced the noble tourists of the past. The Ministry of Social Affairs has established 22 reception centers here to provide relief, so that they do not starve to death. I visited several reception centers and discovered a previously undiscovered fact: the refugees who were “liberated” by the Communist Party in the so-called “liberated areas” of northern Jiangsu used to be relatively wealthy people, but now they are poor farmers and workers—those “masses” of whom the Communist Party boasts—who are also fleeing together.</p>
<h3 id="e134">Two and a Half Dan of Harvested Rice Seized from Three <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>A 39-year-old poor farmer said angrily:</p>
<p>"They gave me three and a half mu of land, and I thought I could live a good life; who knew that they would seize two and a half dan of the three dan rice harvest, how can I live like this?"</p>
<p>The Communist Party's revolutionary means are violent. It fundamentally denies everything inherent, hoping to change China's color all at once. On this point, it is destined to fail. The people in the so-called "liberated areas" are now like being suspended in mid-air: everything old, even the patriarchal relationships that the Chinese people value most, has been destroyed without a trace; and for the new, they only see a kind of devouring like a flood of wild beasts, to swallow their entire humanity in the Party's endless desires. Ignorant farmers and workers are gradually understanding; so, they are also fleeing.</p>
<p>That middle-aged farmer also told me a fact—</p>
<p>A government official was captured by the Communist army and called a "Nationalist spy" or "stubborn element" and was to be executed. This punishment has a strange name called "firing a cannon." This is a more cruel atrocity than the atrocities committed by the Japanese army during the War of Resistance.</p>
<p>In an open space, the Communist army ordered that person to dig a pit in the mud and jump down. Then, two soldiers came up and piled the soil back into the mud pit. When it was piled to that person's knees, the upper body was already turning purple; when it was piled to the chest, the face was completely black; then it was piled up, and there was a loud bang, and the crown of that person's head rushed straight into the sky, and blood spurted out like a volcanic eruption for more than two zhang high. —— Heaven! This is "firing a cannon!"</p>
<p>The refugees' stimulus to Yangzhou is great. What this reflects is the close cooperation between the Party, government, merchants, people, and the military.</p>
<h3 id="e135">The Situation is Improving; Both Arms Are Extended <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>The other aspect of the expression is depression. Most of the land properties of the wealthy merchants in Yangzhou include "salt." Now that business is not good, they are endlessly sitting in teahouses every day in boredom. "Fuchun" and "Yiyuan" are two famous ones, which are also the gathering places for the upper class. Tea guests carefully taste tea, gently wave their fans, slowly chew food, and utter a wish, "Will the situation be better next month!"</p>
<p>The situation is indeed improving. After the National Army began its counterattack, the Yangzhou-Taizhou and Yangzhou-Tianchang roads were opened one after another. With both arms extended, it can breathe a sigh of relief. Now people are paying attention to the front, especially Shaobo and Gaoyou.</p>
<p>This breath is still far from restoring prosperity. More than one hundred prostitutes decorate this desolate city, with business desolately light. Seductive stories belong to the distant past! Today, the setting sun accompanies the lonely pagoda by the Slender West Lake, and old monks count flying fireflies in Little Jinshan. I stand on the Five Pavilion Bridge and call out to Yangzhou: "Return my youth"!</p>
<h3 id="e136">Taixing and Taixian are a Pair of Difficult Brothers <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>The two Tai are a pair of difficult brothers.</p>
<p>When I went from Yangzhou to Taixing, the Yangzhou-Taizhou road had just been recovered and was not yet open to traffic. I took the road to Kouan. Mr. Wang Gongyu, Director of the Civil Affairs Department of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, accompanied me.</p>
<p>We arrived in Zhenjiang first. The Kouan ferry did not leave until 2:30 PM. The wind and waves in the Yangtze River were very strong that day, but fortunately we had a tailwind and tailwater. We transferred to a car at Kouan and arrived in Taixing before dark.</p>
<p>Taixing had just gone through a major battle. I had already seen and smelled the traces of war, and the smell of war, when I was still some distance away from it. Of the four gates, east, west, north, and south, only the west gate was open, and the guard was stricter than in Yangzhou. The soldiers ordered our car to stop, and a squad leader walked over.</p>
<h3 id="e137">The Disaster Victims After the Robbery Await the Government's Comfort <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>"Where are you from"?</p>
<p>We told him.</p>
<p>"There is an order from above: no one is allowed to enter the city without permission!" he said sternly; then, he mildly expressed that he would ask the regimental commander for instructions.</p>
<p>After a while, the political instructor of the regimental headquarters and the county magistrate, the director of the Party Department, and other people came out of the city in a long line to welcome Director Wang [illegible]. I, the reporter, also enjoyed the benefit. There were only sparse residents in the city. But soon, the national flag was already hung all over the streets, and some people set off firecrackers. This shows how the disaster victims after the robbery expect the government's comfort.</p>
<p>We were received in the county bank that had not yet opened, which was probably the only relatively complete place here, but it was so crude! I say this without any contempt. On the contrary, I am with respect; I know that they—everyone who works in this city—are working hard.</p>
<p>The hero of defending the city, Regimental Commander Liu Guangyu, we were just about to visit him, but he came first. A military uniform wrapped a sturdy body, and laughed excitedly before speaking. Talking about the course of the battle, he was fascinated, eloquent, gesticulating, vaguely like the expression when directing the battle.</p>
<p>I have already reported on the Battle of Taixing. Here I only write about the inspection process.</p>
<p>The next day, I made a pilgrimage throughout the city. This is not like a city. The degree of desolation is just like a village in the mountains. There are not many decent shops, and the food shops only sell fried dough sticks and large cakes.</p>
<p>The destruction outside the city gate is even more severe, and there are broken walls everywhere. You can still smell the bloody smell in a city river.</p>
<p>The relief work is complicated. I am anxious for the Ministry of Social Affairs. A drop in the bucket, what can it do!</p>
<h3 id="e138">Division Commander Li Tianxia has the Style of an American General <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>After that, we went to Taixian.</p>
<p>Division Commander Li Tianxia of the 83rd Division is sitting in Taixian. This is a lively and cheerful soldier, and leading troops has some American style. There are various entertainments in the army, and the soldiers get full spiritual life, showing a piece of vitality. When fighting, it is powerful.</p>
<p>Due to the liveliness of Division Commander Li, Taixian city also became lively. The war news followed the liveliness, and after Qutang was recovered, it joined forces with Hai'an and advanced to Dongtai. Division Commander Li said that he would share the joy with the people. Unfortunately, I had already left Taixian and could not participate in the grand event. The magistrate of Taixian, Ding Zuobin, people call him a "model magistrate." Indeed, of the several magistrates I saw in northern Jiangsu! Zhang Jichuan of Yangzhou, Xue Peiqi of Taixing, and Ding Zuobin of Taixian, all deserve to be called good magistrates. They haven't reached the time to "do bad things." Everything is most important for local stability. The Communist army's militia is constantly destroying and harassing, which makes them most headache. Mr. Wang Gongyu said with emotion: "I must find a way to increase the local military force, at least to the point where we can use our local force to deal with the local force of the Communist army!"</p>
<h3 id="e139">Precious Island Taiwan <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>— Our Newspaper's Taiwan Airmail Report from the 4th, Special Correspondent Jiang Muyun</p>
<p>In a cafeteria next to Taipei Station where I was eating a "set meal," I encountered a visitor from the capital who had flown across the Taiwan Strait. He suddenly asked, "What's really going on in Taiwan? Shanghai newspapers are scolding it harshly!" I calmly replied, "Taiwan has lovable aspects and hateful aspects! You can only understand it after living here for a long time."</p>
<p>Transition Period:</p>
<p>Inevitable Transitional Phenomena</p>
<p>After parting with him, I thought that although Taiwan had been recovered for almost a year, people at home and abroad didn't clearly understand this new land. Even among those working on the ground and most Taiwanese people, probably not many had a clear understanding. This is not regrettable, people say it's a transitional phenomenon of the transition period.</p>
<p>When the Portuguese landed on this island of Taiwan, witnessing the beauty of its mountains, rivers, and natural features, they called it "Formosa." Foreigners continued to refer to it as the "Beautiful Island." Fifty-one years ago, when the Treaty of Shimonoseki was signed, China presented it to Japan. Japan, lacking subtropical land and harboring ambitions for southward expansion, used Taiwan as a base and a supply depot for its rear. It exploited Taiwan to the fullest extent, extracting its industrial and commercial resources under colonial economic policies to supply Japan. Japan took from it inexhaustibly, thus praising it as a "Precious Island," "Warehouse," and "Treasure House." These terms were heavily laden with the implication of exploitation!</p>
<p>Developing to:</p>
<p>The Saturation Point of the Taiwan Island</p>
<p>Taiwan doesn't have anything that can be truly considered a "treasure." If we have to point out "treasures," we can only point to certain special products: rice, sugarcane, tea, bananas, pineapples, forests, and others. Rice production is about eight to nine million "shi" per year, with about four million "shi" exported annually, all supplied to Japan. In the future, this can supplement the food supply of Fujian and Guangdong. But it should be noted that the arable land throughout the province has been developed by the Japanese to 22.2%, similar to the intensive farmland in the Jiangnan area. The farmland surface cannot be expanded further and requires more fertilizer and labor. Sugarcane cultivation has been partially converted to rice fields, so rice production should not decrease. Although sugar production is greatly reduced at present, it is hoped that it will occupy a place in the world market in the future, and China's 450 million people can also avoid relying on foreign countries for sugar. Tea cannot restore its original output, and the overseas market is encountering a high-cost crisis. However, it needs to be planned in conjunction with the national tea industry. Other subtropical crops, such as fruits, share the same characteristics as the subtropical agricultural regions of Fujian and Guangdong in China's vast area and cannot be regarded as Taiwan's "treasure." Because Taiwan is a sedimentary rock formation from the Tertiary period, with volcanic rock distributed only in the northeast, its underground resources are not abundant, especially iron, which is not produced. Although the Japanese began to establish mechanical and chemical industries, either crude products relied on Japan, or the finished products still supplied Japan. The production process of any department is incomplete, and some are completely to meet wartime needs! Therefore, Taiwan doesn't have a "treasure." The aspect in which it is superior to Fujian and Guangdong is the construction foundation of the Japanese. However, it is approaching its saturation point and doesn't have the same promising future as Guangdong's Hainan Island.</p>
<p>Maintaining:</p>
<p>The Hearts of Six Million People</p>
<p>Taiwan currently has a population of 6.3 million. Except for 130,000 indigenous people from Malaya, most are from Quanzhou and Zhangzhou, and a small portion are from Hakka and various parts of Guangdong. The first wave of immigrants in the late Ming Dynasty were pirates. The second wave were remnants opposing the Qing Dynasty, who came with Zheng Chenggong. The majority were merchants, officials, clerks, and other fugitives. Xu Dishan's "Biography of Mr. Kuiyuan" points out that immigrants can be divided into five types: (1) pirates, (2) fishermen, (3) human traffickers, (4) commoners evading heavy taxes, (5) prisoners of Japanese pirates. They are fiercely independent, prone to infighting, and their best qualities are their conservatism, strong resistance, willingness to endure hardship, and adventurous spirit. Historically, they drove out the Dutch, and during the Japanese rule, they were never peaceful, with minor disturbances every three years and major upheavals every ten years. Initially, the Japanese adopted a conquering attitude, but the result strengthened the anti-Japanese movement, such as the Beipu, Linjipu, Miaoli, Liujia, Dongshi movements, etc. The Wushe Incident in 1930, in which 134 of the 227 resident Japanese were killed, was a lesson for Japanese rule over the indigenous people.</p>
<p>We must acknowledge that the Taiwanese people are excellent, but officials from the mainland must not look down on Taiwanese people with an arrogant attitude or treat them with the methods used for colonies. This needs to be corrected because China must not lose these six million people!</p>
<p>Three Types of People:</p>
<p>Expressing Opposition to Reality</p>
<p>But Taiwanese people are not without shortcomings. The parochialism and shortsightedness of island people, impatience and lack of perseverance, and the common sluggishness and laziness of tropical people are often exposed. They attribute the high prices, insecure life, the inability to quickly improve public order, and even germs and corruption to mainlanders. They resent the government's failure to select Taiwanese as first-class cadres. At an important gathering, a person in charge, who occupied an important position, frankly pointed out that there are three types of people who oppose the current situation: (1) The "obedient gentlemen" of the Japanese era, who were deeply afraid of being severely punished by the government in the early days of the recovery, hid themselves. Later, seeing that the government was lenient, they came out again, hoping to regain their previous special status. When the government couldn't satisfy their desires, they became resentful. (2) Those who were pawns of the Japanese in the economy, who were previously allocated many public lands by the Japanese to sublet to tenant farmers and exploit them in between. Now, the land is being cleared, and the government is taking it back, eliminating the exploitation of intermediaries for the farmers. They also complain. (3) Taiwanese compatriots returning from various places, requesting to work in their original agencies. After the recovery, all kinds of "companies" were abolished, and they couldn't find jobs, so they also complained. These three types of people are in the opposition. Some elected senators were even pointed out to be "favorites" of the Japanese government in the past. But objectively speaking, there are really not many Taiwanese with political talent. Recently, the National Government stipulated that eight Taiwanese members of parliament be elected. How to select them? Who to elect? This poses a difficult problem for the Taiwanese people.</p>
<p>There are about 2,000 Japanese people conscripted in Taiwan. Some are indeed working peacefully, while others are "staying behind" here for other purposes. Cargo ships from Japan bring Japanese women, and the military police have arrested Japanese people secretly carrying out activities. Because Taiwanese people have developed feelings for the Japanese over the past 50 years, some secretly marry Japanese women, and some technicians eagerly seek to return to the embrace of Japan. This phenomenon is painful but realistic.</p>
<p>Becoming:</p>
<p>An Economic Group with the Whole Country</p>
<p>Taiwan is a province of China. Like other provinces, it is an administrative unit of China, with no difference or special characteristics. The only thing is that this Chinese land was forcibly occupied by the Japanese for 50 years and is now returned to its original owner. The government doesn't need to focus excessively on Taiwan, and Taiwan doesn't have the idea of being a surviving colony to be exploited to supply the country.</p>
<p>Governor Chen Yi adopted some of the Japanese methods in certain areas. The biggest features are the existence of the Monopoly Bureau and the controlled Trade Bureau. In reality, the monopoly products camphor, tobacco, alcohol, matches, weights, and measures, etc., don't hold much hope. The Japanese used opium, salt, and the above five items to account for more than 38/100 of total fiscal revenue. Currently, they account for more than 32/100 of total revenue, but the future is bleak. Regarding these two bureaus, Governor Chen Yi explained that this is a method of developing national capital according to Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings and will also be a nursery for the implementation of the Three Principles of the People in Taiwan. The province's budget for this year is 2.4 billion, but the main source of income relies on the revenue of public enterprises, accounting for more than 80/100. However, each enterprise unit is currently in a state of great distress, lacking raw materials, lacking markets, and facing high electricity and labor costs. The destroyed infrastructure cannot be restored quickly, and the restored infrastructure cannot maintain a balance of income and expenditure. As a result, they have to find ways to increase taxes on land and real estate and issue banknotes.</p>
<p>This is Not:</p>
<p>A Ball on the East Pacific</p>
<p>Taiwan doesn't have hyperinflation, but rather chronic inflation, which cannot yet be considered malignant. Governor Chen said that the monopoly of goods, the control of sugar, and the maintenance of the Taiwan dollar are all transitional measures taken to preserve the province's vitality. People criticize his decisions without understanding them and deeply hate them. However, he is happy to accept suggestions for correction regarding the skills and integrity of technicians and staff. In reality, Taiwan's politics needs to truly align with the mainland, and economically, it needs to become an economic group with the whole of China in order to find a way out. Specialization is impossible and unworkable. Taiwanese people fear that the island of Taiwan will be a ball on the East Pacific, tossed around. The government has no way to continue to cultivate this new land, restore the people's hearts, but Taiwanese people need to be self-sufficient, need nutrition, need life, and more urgently need to courageously take on the responsibility of construction.</p>
<p>Taiwan is a province of China. It develops by inheriting the overall situation of the country. Building an agricultural and industrialized Taiwan and strengthening the national defense fortress of China's southeast gateway can find its future. In fact, it is not a cancer for China.</p>
<p>Ambassador Stuart Passes Through Hong Kong A Speaking Mouth Has Been Silenced!</p>
<p>Our Newspaper's Hong Kong Airmail Report from the 2nd, Special Correspondent Ling Fang</p>
<p>Sir Stevenson, the new British Ambassador to China, is a diplomat with liberal ideas. When he came to China to take office, passing through Singapore, the "Crossroads of Asia" via the Suez Canal, he made a statement to the press corps regarding the "Future of Hong Kong." When it reached Hong Kong, the Hong Kong government became seven-parts wary of him. Some responsible journalists in Hong Kong counted the days until the new ambassador's arrival and asked the Hong Kong Government Information Services to arrange an interview with the new ambassador. This alarmed the colonial officials who were trying to maintain Hong Kong's pre-war status at all costs. They discussed it again and again and finally decided that the new ambassador could not meet with journalists. The new ambassador's words, "Chairman Chiang Kai-shek has stated that the future of Hong Kong is a matter to be discussed in due course. This is also the attitude of the British government" — see Reuters Singapore dispatch on the 22nd — may be said elsewhere, but not here in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Ambassador Stevenson arrived in Hong Kong on the British aircraft carrier HMS Unicorn at 10:30 AM on the 26th, having traveled from Singapore. Governor of Hong Kong Young Mau-chi sent General Fitzwilliams, Commander of the British Forces in Hong Kong, and T. Megarry, Secretary for Chinese Affairs, to the pier to welcome him. The new ambassador and his wife went ashore, reviewed the honor guard, and drove to Government House. Until they departed Hong Kong for Shanghai on the British warship HMS Constance, not a single journalist was seen. They accompanied the ambassador on tours of the island's scenery and arranged a rich entertainment program, occupying all of the new ambassador's time in Hong Kong. Regardless of whether the new ambassador was happy or not, the Hong Kong government's plan succeeded: the ambassador's speaking mouth was sealed airtight. Governor Young Mau-chi, originally scheduled to visit Guangzhou on the 28th, delayed it by one day because of the new ambassador.</p>
<h3 id="e140">Mrs. Ma and Madam Chiang Stroll on Kuling Street Our Newspaper's Lushan Airmail Report from the 6th <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Xie Baozhu</p>
<p>Mrs. Ma and Madam Chiang strolled on Kuling Street and were very interested to find that the stores on the street had a full range of goods. As a result, they saw a girl's children's clothing item displayed in a store, with a very beautiful style, and bought one to take back, delighted. However, both ladies strolled on the street without bringing any money with them, and temporarily ordered their attendants to return to the residence to get money to pay the bill.</p>
<p>The eldest daughter of President Soong came to the mountain, and Madam Chiang took great care of her. In addition to personally taking her for walks, she also accompanied her to buy a swimsuit and told her to go swimming. On the afternoon of the 5th, Madam and Mrs. Ma accompanied Miss Soong to visit the swimming pool and found that the facilities inside were very good, and checked the temperature gauge at 75 degrees, which they thought was very suitable. So, they went to the street together and spent 85,000 yuan to buy a beige wool swimsuit for Miss Soong, and bought a large straw hat to give her. In addition, Madam also bought three wool vests, each costing 35,000 yuan, two of which were given to Mr. and Mrs. Ma, and one was bought for the Chairman.</p>
<p>Miss Soong did not bring a straw hat when she came to the mountain, but the midday sun was scorching. Miss Soong, unable to refuse the loving kindness of her father and aunt, had to put on President Soong's straw hat. However, walking on the street, she was afraid of being gossiped about by passersby. Therefore, in crowded places, she took off her hat, and in less crowded places, she put it on again. Fortunately, Madam bought one and gave it to her, and Miss Soong was immediately relieved and delighted.</p>
<p>Miss Soong is not as particular about her clothes as her mother. Yesterday, she wore a light blue, large lapel silk shirt, poweris suit pants, with the ends of the pants rolled up above her knees, a leather belt around her waist, and black flat leather shoes, walking with a sway, quite like a "cowherd." Miss Soong especially likes to wear sunglasses, and I heard that she always wears them even inside the house. People thought she had an eye problem, but in fact, Miss Soong has bright eyes and white teeth, without any flaws.</p>
<p>Mr. and Mrs. Ma invited the Chairman and his wife, President Soong and his daughter to a banquet at their private residence last night. Mrs. Ma wore a water-red floral silk Chinese-style long cheongsam given to her by Madam Chiang. Chairman Chiang praised her for looking very beautiful in Chinese clothes as soon as he entered the door, and Mrs. Ma jumped for joy upon hearing this.</p>
<p>After President Soong went up the mountain, he spent most of his time at the Chairman's official residence discussing important matters with the Chairman. When you walk past Hedong Road, you can often see the Chairman and the President sitting and talking on the veranda. Therefore, the President didn't have much time to accompany his daughter on trips, so he left her with Madam and asked her to take care of her. Madam could also get an extra companion, and often took Miss Soong for walks or chats in the garden.</p>
<p>Luo Jialun has composed twelve poems in his week in Kuling. Those who ask Luo for poems are mostly students from summer camps and members of lecture courses. Luo is always responsive, completing them with a flourish, with magnificent spirit and rich scenery.</p>
<p>As soon as Minister Peng Xuepei arrived in Kuling and entered the Xianyan Hotel, he was surrounded by reporters and held an impromptu press conference, answering reporters' questions about the attack on American troops on the Pingjin Railway.</p>
<p>Mr. Peng loves riding horses and swimming. One day after arriving in Kuling, he went to the swimming pool in high spirits, wanting to show off his skills, but when he touched the water with his hand, he repeatedly said, "The water is too cold!" and had to return disappointed.</p>
<p>Mr. and Mrs. Ma are not very satisfied with the large oil painting in front of the residence. Mr. Ma said: "I don't seem that serious!"</p>
<p>There are many antique buyers coming to Kuling these days, all speaking a few sentences of pidgin English, with the Westerners on the mountain as their biggest customers. When Admiral Kirk came to Kuling this time, there were people who came to his door to peddle them. Mr. Kirk bought some of them, but Mrs. Kirk said: "The price is really expensive." An antique dealer wearing a long black gown always explained to new customers: "We are passing by, because we don't have the money for the boat back home, so we have to sell these antiques." But if you buy something from him today, he will come again tomorrow, bringing a large batch of inventory for you to choose from, and I don't know where those things come from.</p>
<p>Madam Chiang's personal secretary, Ms. Chen Chunlian, brought her one-year-old baby to live at No. 15 Zhihong Road this time. Ms. Chen goes to Madam's office for one or two hours around 10:00 every morning and then goes home for lunch. If Madam calls in the afternoon, she goes to the official residence. Otherwise, she always stays at home to take care of her child.</p>
<p>After the Lizi Society came to the mountain to work, they took over the Kuling tennis court, swimming pool, etc. In the past, these places were managed by the Lushan Administration Bureau. Now that their business has been taken away, everyone is very unhappy.</p>
<p>The weather in Lushan has been getting hotter recently, and coffee tea rooms and sports venues are booming, especially the swimming pool, which is frequented by many people. Swimming tickets cost 1,000 yuan each, but in reality, very few people actually buy tickets. Most are members of the Lizi Society or have special relationships.</p>

<p>(1) Wang Cheng asks: I am 48 years old and suddenly developed a frequent hiccuping condition six or seven years ago. At first, I didn't think it was strange, but now the hiccuping sound is getting louder, like a cow's moo. I often feel nauseous, my abdomen is bloated, and I don't feel hungry even when I don't eat. When I wake up in the morning, my abdomen is harder than usual, my stomach lining is abnormally thin, and my lower back hurts severely. Looking at the course of the disease, it seems to be getting worse. I am a salaried worker and cannot afford to see a doctor. I sincerely ask you to give me a simple and effective prescription. I would be extremely grateful.</p>
<p>[Answer from Dr. Yu Xin'en, MD]: Hiccups may be caused by swallowing foods that are too hot or irritating, or by gastritis and stomach distension. They can also be caused by chronic alcohol poisoning. It is necessary to first find the cause of the disease. In addition to the common methods for stopping hiccups, you can also try placing an ice pack on your neck or pressing your eyeballs with your fingers. If all of these are ineffective and the hiccups persist repeatedly, then you can only cut the phrenic nerve to stop them.</p>
<p>(2) Hu Shi asks: On August 9th of last year, after dinner, I visited a friend at his residence. Shortly after sitting down, I felt dizzy and lost consciousness. My mouth and lips were crooked, and I fell to the ground. My friend sent me back home, and I have been receiving medical treatment ever since. However, after ten months, I still cannot return to normal. My right foot has no sensation when it touches the ground, and I cannot lift my right hand. Chinese and Western medicine have both been ineffective. How unfortunate! What is this disease? Are there any doctors who can treat this disease? I respectfully ask for a detailed answer.</p>
<p>[Answer from Dr. Yu Xin'en, MD]: The disease is called stroke and hemiplegia. You should rest more and improvement will be slower. You should not be anxious.</p>
<p>(3) Lu Wenbu asks: I am a worker and am experiencing economic hardship due to rising prices. I cannot afford to see a doctor. I humbly ask that you answer my question in your newspaper. I would be very grateful. My child is only 17 months old and developed symptoms similar to a nerve condition or a fright in mid-September of last year. When frightened, his face loses color (for about two minutes) and then he sleeps less. So far, he has been frightened once every few days. Is this epilepsy or pig epilepsy? Is it dangerous? What are the economical treatments?</p>
<p>[Answer from Dr. Yu Xin'en, MD]: The disease is called epilepsy. You can use a brain sedative, as prescribed by a doctor.</p>

<p>Editor: Before the war, someone used a job title for a piece of land in the Sixteenth District of the Fourth District of the Twenty-first District of Shanghai County, Songjiang Prefecture in the fifth year of Xianfeng to mortgage a loan to my father. During the Anti-Japanese War, my father passed away and it was never known where the land was located. I asked the Shanghai Municipal Land Administration Bureau and the offices on Daxi Road and Shangwen Road, but they didn't know either. Please give me a corner of your newspaper to publicly inquire, so that those who know can provide guidance. I respectfully submit this from Liu Feng, 144 Doushi Street, Annam City.</p>

<p>To Whom It May Concern: Our country's eight years of resistance have caused the people to experience suffering, with some families broken and destroyed and some displaced. Fortunately, the darkness has passed, freeing us from our suffering. But unexpectedly, the conflict between the Communists and Nationalists has reignited, placing our people in dire straits. Alas! Recently, Jiangsu and Hunan have either suffered repeated artillery fire or are filled with the bodies of the starved. People either die from weapons or in ditches, becoming refugees with only a breath of life left! I am unworthy but, relying on the blessings of my ancestors, I can still have enough to eat. Every time I think of my fellow sufferers, I am filled with sorrow! I dare to donate my savings, trying to do my best to help. I am only seeking my heart's peace and doing what I can. Herewith is a bank draft for two million legal tender (see donation report in this column on August 7). I respectfully hope that you will accept it and forward it to the disaster victims in Jiangsu and Hunan, half each. I am extremely grateful. Respectfully submitted to the Social Services Section of the Shen Bao.</p>

<h3 id="e146">Advocating Educational Savings <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Reporter: I remember that before the war, banks had a type of educational savings scheme. Indeed, this was a good method because the majority of families belong to the impoverished class. Therefore, parents could save up a sum of money, deposit it in the bank, and enable their children to cover tuition fees, book expenses, etc., from primary school to middle school, and even university, each semester without having to find additional ways to make ends meet. When the time came, they could simply withdraw the money from the bank and hand it over to the school to enable their children to study. Such an excellent method was not only affected by the war, but was actually discontinued, which is truly regrettable. After the victory, banks in Shanghai are booming in business but show no intention of planning for the welfare of the people. They are focused on high-interest loans and exploiting the common people. To put it bluntly, this type of bank accounts for 100% of them. According to news gleaned from the end-of-June settlement surplus figures, small banks and money shops have surpluses of tens of millions of yuan, and larger banks and money shops undoubtedly have even more. Although there are many reasons for the low level of education in China, I believe that educational savings are a truly good method to help promote education. I urge the national banks and commercial banks to work hard to promote and restore educational savings! (Wang Xueqian)</p>
<h3 id="e147">How to Eradicate the Poisonous Influence in Xintai <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Editor: During the eight years of the War of Resistance, the occupied areas covered almost more than ten provinces and regions. Wherever the Japanese set foot, wherever their cruel flames reached, poisonous influences followed. Xintai, located at the intersection of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, made it easy for criminals to hide. Therefore, criminal cases occurred repeatedly, and the authorities turned a blind eye. Since the Japanese implemented a policy of poisoning the population, those addicted to opium have largely considered smoking white powder more cost-effective. Little did they know that it would become a trend, and the number of drug offenders increased daily. During the War of Resistance, the government's power may not have reached everywhere, leading to the cultivation of a boil, causing endless harm. As a result, people with status indulge in it as a matter of course, without any sense of shame, leading to the spread of this behavior from top to bottom, and the rampant spread of drug abuse. Drug trafficking organizations are located in the Jiangsu and Zhejiang regions, and the scale of sales is shocking. The police stations refuse to deal with it because they cannot profit from it, and the courts release offenders after only one night due to a concern for prison rations. When will the wise government begin to punish these people with the ultimate penalty, so that society can move towards peace and tranquility? (Gao Jie)</p>
<h3 id="e148">Passenger Safety Should Be Sought <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Editor: The French-owned Red Route 22 public buses always start moving with the door unopened once the ticket conductor has rung the bell, so that a couple of passengers must climb onto the moving bus, the danger of which is easy to imagine. The safety of children and women is especially a concern. When questioned, the conductors respond that "there is no time." It may be that they can complete their journeys earlier and finish work and rest, or that the company limits the journey time. The former reason is perhaps more valid, so stopping times at the stations, especially in the evenings are especially short. When boarding and alighting, the ticket conductors rush people, pressing them like wildfire. I seem to have read similar news in a certain newspaper before, but it did not attract the attention of the authorities, so this situation continues to exist. Now, for the sake of public safety, I am using the medium of your newspaper to make this public. Please City Public Utility Bureau pay attention to it. This concerns human life, so do not delay!

<p>— Cang Shi</p>
<p>Suppose you are bumped into on the tram or on the street, and the legal tender and valuables on your person leave your pocket. Perhaps you go to a store to buy something, and before you have paid, the items have already vanished. Sometimes you and your wife or lover are strolling down the street, and someone blocks your path and kneels on the ground asking for money. Do you feel a headache?</p>
<p>You must feel very angry in your mind, suspecting that the public security organs are not working hard enough. But we must know! These thousands upon thousands of vagrants are not born that way! Here are ironclad facts before us, that a month ago, it was these people who caused you headaches and anger! Today, they make you feel like shedding tears of sympathy. They all stand tall, living a very disciplined collective life, and demonstrate very good self-governance. This relief home is divided into three parts: the adult group, the youth camp, and the children's camp. They receive education and work. The members of the adult group are already able to serve society. Before, they were people rejected by society, but now they have become sound members of society.</p>
<p>At this general review, Mayor Wu was very moved when he saw those who were marching in formation, advancing bravely on the road to self-renewal: "This is the happiest day I've had in Shanghai!" In the whole of China, there are countless millions of such unfortunate people. Why can't we let them also step into this paradise and be cultivated into useful people in society?</p>
<p>I want to appeal to society, to petition philanthropists, to hold fewer temple fairs, to perform fewer Taoist rituals for peace, to live a little less luxurious and selfish lives, and to contribute enthusiastically so that this relief home can be strengthened.</p>
<p>Of course, the fundamental plan is to hope that the government authorities and people from all walks of life will pay attention together and reduce the number of people in society who need relief. At the same time, as a temporary measure, we believe that more relief homes with strict management and highly effective operations should be established, because every vagrant wandering on the streets is, in any case, our own brother, our own compatriot!</p>

<p>— You Chizhao</p>
<p>That was sixteen years ago:</p>
<p>"It's time to go home, what will become of me if I stay here!" Old Hu pondered.</p>
<p>Old Hu was sixty years old this year. He had left home twenty years ago and had hardly returned. He started as a clerk in the × Bureau, and worked for nineteen years, still doing that job, but his monthly salary had increased from fifteen yuan to forty yuan. Besides supporting himself and subsidizing his family, he also earned himself hemorrhoids that had plagued him for many years. Last year, the × Bureau transferred the director, and Old Hu's hemorrhoids happened to flare up. He took a leave of absence for more than a week, but as a result, he lost his position with a monthly salary of forty yuan. The reason was that Old Hu was old and had many illnesses, and should retire. Moreover, he had worked in the bureau for so many years, which was enough! Fortunately, out of pity for his age, they gave him a year's severance pay, which was considered a great grace in the bureau. Old Hu stayed in S City for five months with that severance pay, trying to work hard again, but no one wanted his scrap anymore. Although his work was still skilled and quick, even better than the young people. "I'm old!" Old Hu also felt it was true. An old cow! It would be slaughtered even after being pulled to its limit as repayment. So he felt that it was better to be a person than a cow!</p>
<p>"It's time to go home, what will become of me if I stay here?" He thought again.</p>
<p>Speaking of home, Old Hu remembered his old ancestral house in C City and his three sons and two daughters. He also remembered his deceased old partner. His wife had completed the major events of his children's marriage during the twenty years he was away from home. His wife's second half of her life was also spent washing diapers for the children and serving the third generation, until she took her last breath, which was only three years ago.</p>
<p>Hearing from people from C City: he learned how his daughters-in-law treated his wife, and the circumstances before and after his wife's death. Because of this, he had not sent money or letters home. His children also had not sent news. He was estranged from his family. Thinking of home, he had become a stranger. But now that he had been dismissed from the bureau, and no one wanted him even if he tried to work hard again, it had been five months. What would he do if this continued? Even if he died, he had to be buried with his old partner! This was what made him think of home, but thinking of this—the story of three monks having no water to drink—he was worried. After thinking hard for a while, Old Hu suddenly laughed again. In the end, he decided to go home, to return to his old ancestral house in C City. He heard that his old ancestral house was still inhabited by his three daughters-in-law.</p>
<p>He went and bought two brand new leather suitcases, which were heavy with his few old belongings, and set off by boat back to C City.</p>
<p>"Ah, isn't it true! The ancients also said: 'Returning with a full load' 'To strengthen the journey'," Old Hu thought. He smiled on the surface, but was worried subconsciously.</p>
<p>On Sunday morning, the ship docked at C City. Old Hu thought that old people should take sedan chairs to go home. He also hired porters to carry the luggage. Leaving C City after twenty years, he felt that although it was as old as he was, the model was still the same, and the roads were always familiar. The sedan chair was moving, also arousing a lot of Old Hu's nostalgic emotions.</p>
<p>Home! Only the eldest son and the second son clearly recognized him. The third son also called out to him along with his two brothers. They said:</p>
<p>"Father, you're back!" They were watching his whole body, watching his luggage, especially the two brand new leather suitcases. Old Hu's clothes were not bad either, a gray homespun silk robe, tied trouser legs, wearing new thin-soled shoes.</p>
<p>The porters carrying the luggage, although it was autumn, still had sweat on their foreheads, complaining that the luggage was heavy and they wanted more money.</p>
<p>"The luggage is indeed heavy," Old Hu smiled on his face, "This is my blood and sweat of twenty years, that has accumulated into this little bit, two boxes of it, I was afraid that the old ones could not bear the weight and would break, so I bought two new ones—good, right, must give you a few more coins," Old Hu said, lifting up his long gown and taking out his wallet, full of "silver dollars," snow-white, shining in the eyes of his grandchildren.</p>
<p>"Father, let me pay them," the eldest son hurried to send away the sedan chair carriers, porters.</p>
<p>"Father, you must be tired from the journey, you should rest and sit down," the second son hurried to help.</p>
<p>"Why don't you pour tea for Father, pass him a cigarette!" The third son ordered his daughters-in-law.</p>
<p>"Ah!" Old Hu sighed with comfort, sat on the old rosewood chair, asked about the past, talked about family matters, counted his grandsons.</p>
<p>"Grandpa, Grandpa..." The three daughters-in-law led their children to greet Old Hu. He smiled, took out silver coins, and distributed them to his grandchildren to "buy candy to eat," as a greeting gift.</p>
<p>"Why don't you thank Grandpa quickly!" The daughters-in-law taught their children again. The little mouths laughed and made a fuss, not afraid of strangers, surrounding Old Hu's knees, some even tugging at his clothes, wanting to pull on his wallet, only quieting down when their parents scolded them.</p>
<p>"You clean up that room upstairs and let Father live there, and put the luggage in my place." Old Hu began to instruct his sons, "You have to be frugal to accumulate money, I didn't buy anything for you this time, but save as much as you can. It's by my frugality that I accumulated these two boxes, all for you."</p>
<p>In the evening, Old Hu locked himself in his room, counting the silver coins, which rang for so long that the daughters-in-law could hear it clearly. Everyone felt comfortable.</p>
<p>The next day, the two daughters got the news, and also came with their sons-in-law to meet and greet him.</p>
<p>They talked about Old Hu counting "silver dollars" last night, fearing that Old Hu was too tired, but Old Hu said: "Old people are just not at ease in everything, and they have to check everything themselves. You think, the boxes were put on the boat for so many days, I was afraid that someone would steal some, how can I be at ease if I don't count them."</p>
<p>They also said that hiding the silver was not promising, it was better to deposit it in the money shop, lend it to others, do business. Old Hu said: "You young people don't understand things, people's hearts are not as old as they used to be, the money shop will also close down, and doing business will also lose money, it's better for me to keep it safely, after all, when I breathe my last, it will be yours, and then you can do whatever you want."</p>
<p>Old Hu's three sons all had jobs, and lived together but ate separately. They discussed taking turns supporting their father for a month each. Sometimes Old Hu went to his son-in-law's house and stayed for a few days, sometimes he distributed small silver coins to the children, and used them as his own pocket money. Sometimes he counted them repeatedly, always ringing until midnight.</p>
<p>During Qingming Festival, he also went to his wife's grave, and when he came back, he said to his sons:</p>
<p>"You handle things thoughtfully, but I have always advocated saving, your mother's tombstone is too big, it is best to shorten it by five inches, leaving only five inches to save money, and the soil does not need to be piled so high:" As he said this, his eyes turned red, and his sons thought he was missing his mother, and persuaded him.</p>
<p>Old Hu just lived like this, supported by his sons. The neighbors all said that he was more blessed than his old partner.</p>
<p>In the late spring of Old Hu's sixty-fourth year, his hemorrhoids flared up again, more severe than in previous years, prolapsed. He could not sit or lie down in peace. He himself felt that his appetite was getting worse day by day, and he could not swallow much when he looked at things.</p>
<p>"Hmm, it's over, this, there's not much left, I should go!" Old Hu lay in bed, playing with a dozen "silver dollars" with his withered hands, thinking to himself.</p>
<p>In April. On the day he breathed his last, he called his children to his bedside. He was still conscious. He said:</p>
<p>"You have finally raised Dad like a human being for a few years, but, you were also educated by Dad and Mom." Speaking of this, he couldn't help but shed tears, "Let your eldest brother be in charge of distributing what I leave behind..." As if feeling ashamed, or lacking strength, he paused for a while. "But, we are also a big family, your grandfather, your great-grandfather were also officials, but when it came to Dad, the times changed, and I became a useless person, you have forgotten Dad." He began to gasp. "You should also not be like a small family, dividing it up as soon as Dad closes his eyes, at least, do my funeral properly first, and also be buried with your mother." Speaking of this, his eyes moistened again, "Eldest son, give the keys to the boxes to you, you must follow Dad's words, do you understand!" After saying this, he turned his face inside and slept, and the children's eyes also turned red.</p>
<p>Old Hu gradually spoke unclearly, and breathed his last by evening, but his eyes seemed to not be able to close.</p>
<p>The whole family mourned, and the innocent little grandson choked and wanted his grandpa. The children were discussing his funeral. Originally, everyone wanted to take out some money to raise enough to handle things for him. But the eldest brother insisted:</p>
<p>"I'll take care of it first, Dad also entrusted me with it. I propose to divide what he left behind, except for the ancestral house, into five parts, we three brothers each take one part, the two sisters each take half a part, and the remaining half part will be given to my eldest son, because he is the嫡孫, and the remaining half part will be considered Dad and Mom's "sacrificial fees"."</p>
<p>Everyone temporarily felt that there was no objection to this method, but everyone said: "Dad worked hard to save so many things for us, we must also make him glorious after death, and bury him and Mom together, and erect a large stone stele."</p>
<p>Old Hu's funeral: the funeral procession, burial, opening sacrifice, "doing the seventh," "lighting the main candle" and "ascending the platform" were all done. The neighbors and relatives all said that he was more blessed than his old partner.</p>
<p>That day, Old Hu's children came to distribute what he had left behind. When they lifted the two heavy leather suitcases, happiness overflowed their brows, and their hearts were like they were jumping. The siblings blamed the eldest brother for taking too much advantage.</p>
<p>The eldest brother took out the keys and opened the two suitcases first, the faces of everyone changed from bright to fiery, and the wide eyes gradually shrank.</p>
<p>In the two suitcases, what was covered on top were Old Hu's old clothes, and what was underneath, what was underneath were those bricks, tiles, and stones.</p>

<p>— By Thomas Lawrence (1769-1830)</p>
<p>Displayed at the Victoria Museum in London</p>
<p>At the age of ten, Lawrence began his artistic career, painting portraits in chalk. In 1787, he entered the Royal Academy. From then on, he became the center of fashion. He painted portraits of the most beautiful and talented women of the time. His painting fees were extremely high, and he spent money like water.</p>
<p>In 1815, he painted "The Victors of Waterloo" for the Windsor Gallery, and he also painted many portraits while traveling to major European cities. He received great honor in both social and artistic circles, and was hailed as a great English painter.</p>
<p>However, after his death, there was a major reaction, and he fell from overpraise during his lifetime to the sad state of devaluation.</p>
<p>The fact is that Lawrence did paint some immortal works. Some are in private collections, and some are displayed in galleries. These portraits of women have noble and poetic qualities. Although his coloring is sometimes inevitably monotonous, and sometimes lacks nature and simplicity, it is still a masterpiece. —Cheng Lu attached a note</p>

<p>— By Victor Hugo Translated by Li Jianwu</p>
<p>Napoleon's descendants deceived France, overthrew the Second Republic, declared a restoration, and restored the Empire. The great poet Victor Hugo was exiled abroad from 1852 for a full eighteen years, until Prussia marched into Paris, the Empire collapsed, and the Republic was rebuilt, before returning to his motherland. —Translator</p>
<p>Li Jianwu appended a note. August 5. Since justice is in the abyss, since the jade tablet has been given to evil, since all rights have been sold out, since even the proudest have a bitter face, since the corner of the boundary stone is plastered with the shame of my motherland; O Republic created by ancestors, Lingyan Pavilion full of bright light, golden dome in the free firmament, temple of immortal souls, since people have moved a ladder to paste the empire on your wall; Since spirituality has all died out, since crawling, since forgetting truth, purity, greatness, beauty, eyes angry for history, reputation, law, right, glory, and the martyrs in the wall tomb; I love you, exile! Pain! I love you! Sorrow, take it as my crown! I love you, proud poverty! I love my door with the wind hitting it. I love sorrow, serious statues to sit beside me. I love that disaster that tests me, I find the shadows of you, O for you my heart rejoices, dignity, faith, obscured morality, you, freedom, proud exile, and you, loyalty, great fugitive! I love this lonely island! Jersey, free England covers it with old pavilions, ever-rising black water, ships, wandering plows, waves, mysterious field roads. I love your cranes, O deep sea flapping brown wings, shaking the water waves above into pearls, throwing them into the surging 彼刃, and then coming out of the open throat, as if a soul walking out of pain. I love the solemn absoluteness, I hear the groans of eternity, incessant like a guilt, forever reborn in the shadows, waves brushing against the gloomy reefs, mothers embracing their dead children.</p>

<p>— Shao Fu</p>
<p>This day last year was a day of jubilation. In Chongqing, people were like crazy, shouting and screaming, everywhere were firecrackers, wine bottles and extra editions. I remember going to a restaurant for a small drink, because Comrade Zhao Dan had returned from prison in Xinjiang, and we were giving him a welcome dinner. After leaving the restaurant, a surge of anger swept the streets. The US News Agency's mimeographed small extra edition announced that Japan had formally surrendered. People were distributing them everywhere. I hurried back to the newspaper, while Comrade Zhao Dan, on his way home, was said to have been injured on his buttocks by wine bottles thrown randomly on the street. The outburst of emotion, the accumulated pain of eight years, all got a vent. There were tears in the laughter. It was really hard to describe the flavor.</p>
<p>It was not just Chongqing, but people all over China experienced that kind of psychological state—laughing with tears, and a bit of bewildered blankness.</p>
<p>A year ago today, how did we think about the days ahead? I dare not say that it was a beautiful dream. Those who could truly understand reality could not have harbored extravagant hopes. However, we always believed that the days ahead would at least be much looser than the past eight years. We always had this minimum belief, but after these three hundred and sixty-five days, even that was shattered. To be honest, the pain we all feel today is still greater than it was a year ago.</p>
<p>We are not afraid of inflation, we are not afraid of high prices, we are not afraid of stagnant production. What we are afraid of is that the grand plan of national construction cannot be carried out, that there is indefinite procrastination, a state of being neither dead nor alive, that corruption runs rampant, that social customs are deteriorating, and that everyone has reached a stage of losing faith. Such a victory, the victory that brought these things, is not what we could have imagined, and even more so, not what we can accept.</p>
<p>It has been a year since the victory. Reviewing this messy account, today we should still be wiping away tears, and the tears we shed are probably not of joy but of anger.</p>
<h3 id="e169">The Fate of a Badge <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>— Yang Mou</p>
<p>Although I have this round badge with a beautiful flower on it, I am afraid to wear it.</p>
<p>Although when entering or leaving the office, the guards scrutinize you for your badge, I would rather slightly expose my lapel when I am almost in front of them. I don't want to always display it prominently. Although some people proudly stick out their chests and wear their badges high, looking both spirited and proud, I can only secretly admire them. I dare not. Why? Maybe I am not worthy, perhaps I fear I will bring misfortune or shame to the badge; or maybe I fear the badge will bring these things to me.</p>
<p>Wearing a badge on the tram, even though I have bought a ticket, it always seems like I am suspected of freeloading. Sometimes, the ticket seller or inspector is especially polite and simply doesn't ask you for a ticket. Other times, when they do ask for your ticket, it seems like they are more cautious than they are with other passengers. They might be preparing to embarrass you, but you have nothing to say.</p>
<p>Once, I was riding a bicycle when the front wheel of a bicycle next to me got caught in my back wheel while avoiding a car. As a result, several spokes of his front wheel broke. That person was unreasonable. Even though it was his own fault, he insisted that I compensate him. I argued with him, but he stubbornly insisted. As more and more onlookers gathered, he even made a big deal about my badge, as if I was bullying him because of my position. Two people nearby even said, "Now it's a democracy, you can't rely on your official status anymore." It was truly laughable and upsetting. In order to avoid trouble, and because I was wearing that badge, I had to unfairly compensate him.</p>
<p>Luckily, I don't go to dance halls, but for friends who do, the badge is a major obstacle. Aren't civil servants repeatedly prohibited from going to such places? Of course, you can still go if you want, but be sure to hide that badge well. Otherwise, regardless of right or wrong, you might become an unfortunate scapegoat.</p>
<p>Friend gatherings and public places are also best avoided when wearing a badge. Wearing a badge is like representing a sense of poverty. Seeing someone wearing a badge at a social gathering always leads people to associate it with words like "seeking personal gain," "making requests," and "showing favoritism." Aren't there also laws restricting banquets and gatherings for civil servants?</p>
<p>I like my work, and I like my badge. But I keep my affection hidden in my heart, and I keep my badge hidden in my lapel.</p>
<p>I don't want to go to dance halls or attend social gatherings, but I also don't want to be subjected to any more discrimination, even a little bit, against my self-respect and anger.</p>
<p>I don't know if I am letting the badge down, or if the badge is letting me down, but I carefully keep it hidden.</p>

<p>— Jun Yi</p>
<p>"官" (Official): The head wears a gauze hat, full of official airs. But below are two mouths. One is used when taking office to swear, "If I am found to be corrupt, I will accept severe punishment." The other is used for seeking personal gain and negotiating prices when engaging in malfeasance, so it is larger than the upper mouth. The two mouths are connected together to form the character "官."</p>
<p>"中" (Center): A square circle, with one stroke in the middle. If it leans left, the right side looks bad; if it leans right, the left side looks unattractive. It is still the way of the middle, remaining straight down the center. This is what is meant by "impartiality is called the center."</p>
<p>"國" (Nation): Many people, little land. Warfare is rampant in the Northeast. The outer line has a gap in the northwest corner. It must be improved.</p>
<p>"漢" (Han): From above, it looks a bit like a revolutionary. But below it is a "hoary old thief with white hair." Once fallen into the water, he naturally becomes a hero of the Han traitor category.</p>
<p>"奸" (Traitor): All those who do the work of a traitor cannot escape having to do with "dry women". It's a pity that the skirt is not long enough. If it were a little longer, and hooked from below, it would be a good character. A Han traitor becomes a Han good man, then does a somersault, and with a shake of his body, wouldn't he be another "good fellow"?</p>
<p>"接" (Receive): When interacting with a concubine, one always avoids the face of the first wife, secretly and discreetly, not very upright and aboveboard.</p>
<p>"收" (Receive): Receiving "talents of shells," failure is imminent.</p>
<h3 id="e171">Untitled <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>— Shen Zhishan</p>
<p>Recently, the weather has been exceptionally hot, so I thought of the song that Wu Yong, Bai Sheng, and others sang when robbing Liang Zhongshu's birthday gifts in the Water Margin:</p>
<p>"The red heart burns like fire,</p>
<p>The crops in the fields are half-withered,</p>
<p>The farmers' hearts are like boiling water,</p>
<p>The sons of nobles wave their fans."</p>
<p>Reflecting the social situation at that time; and now, the lives of the people of Subei in my hometown can be described as:</p>
<p>"The red sun scorches like fire,</p>
<p>Civil strife and war scorch the home;</p>
<p>The hearts of the people are like boiling water,</p>
<p>Allied nations shake their heads!"</p>
<h3 id="e172">Sick People Cannot Get Medical Treatment, How Can They Afford Taoist Rituals for Ghosts? <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>— Xin Yun</p>
<p>It is almost time for the annual Taoist rituals again. In the alley where I live, fundraising has already begun since yesterday. According to the organizers, this year's rituals are scheduled to begin on the first day of the seventh lunar month. They estimate that the expenses on that day will be over a million yuan, so they hope for generous donations. They also claim that this ritual will surely drive away the epidemic ghosts from the alley.</p>
<p>Hearing these words, I couldn't help but laugh. If Taoist rituals could really drive away epidemic ghosts, what would be the use of epidemic hospitals? Why not simply have a large-scale ritual performed throughout Shanghai, driving all the epidemic ghosts completely out of the country? Wouldn't that save the authorities a sum of epidemic prevention expenses, and also allow the angels who go out every day to administer vaccinations to have some free time, killing two birds with one stone? Why not do it?</p>
<p>But in today's age of scientific advancement, everyone can prove that Taoist rituals are useless. So here, with twelve thousand points of sincerity, I implore all the enlightened people of Shanghai, never to believe in Taoist rituals, and to donate all this money for rituals to epidemic or refugee relief. Think about it: one alley needs to spend millions of yuan on rituals, so how many hundreds or thousands of alleys are there in Shanghai? Isn't this total amount astonishing? Putting it on epidemic or refugee donations, how many people can be saved?</p>
<p>Enlightened people of Shanghai! Think about it, which is right?</p>

<p>— By Zhang Leping</p>
<h3 id="e174">My Observation of Cattle Slaughter at the World's Third Largest Slaughterhouse <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Gange</p>
<p>Herds of cattle from all directions, driven by whips, walked across the bridge and stopped by the riverbank. Someone on the boat casually asked the cattle drivers:</p>
<p>"Do you need fodder?"</p>
<p>But this was obviously redundant, because the cattle had now become mere commodities. Before selling the commodities, the owners would never increase the cost of their commodities.</p>
<p>Beside the river was a deformed building, not very tall, but with a considerable area. Day and night, tidal waves of people, cattle, horses, and pigs squeezed through the narrow door. And people and carts carrying various fresh meats squeezed out. The nearby alleyways thus seemed even more bustling. ...</p>
<p>This is the famous world's third largest slaughterhouse - the Shajing Road Slaughterhouse, the place where the death sentences of cattle, horses, pigs, and sheep are carried out, which is also a major source of fresh meat supply in this city.</p>
<p>Tearful cattle, seemingly sensing their fate, shed tears at the gate. This is the end of their life of hard work: slaughter them! Although they shed tears, begging for their last chance to live, it is useless. Using tears to beg will never get the sympathy of mankind! Under the circumstances of being pulled and dragged, they still present their last gift in the same way – that is, their own bodies!</p>
<p>"This is the cattle detention center," the guide said to me.</p>
<p>I covered my mouth and nose with a large towel and inspected it deeply. Very clean, rows of cattle were quietly waiting here, with a pile of fodder placed beside them.</p>
<p>"Are these calves also going to be slaughtered?" When I discovered a pair of adorable calves, I asked curiously.</p>
<p>"Of course, milk is expensive. People need beef and milk, so they can't worry about them. Fortunately, slaughtering the calves not only provides tender beef to eat, but also leaves behind a portion of delicious fresh milk to squeeze for people to drink every day..." He was about to continue, but I shook my hand, and then stroked the back of the calf, which was so cute.</p>
<p>The calf raised its head, gazing deeply at us, wanting to move, but obviously being a newborn calf, it couldn't move yet.</p>
<p>"They're starting over there, would you like to go?" he urged, so I had to lift my feet and move forward!</p>
<p>Death machine pulled, a cow flipped down, and struggled to get up again below.</p>
<p>"Not dead?" I asked in surprise.</p>
<p>"It's too early yet, there's no electric current, so we can only use a hammer to kill them before slaughtering, look!"</p>
<p>I saw a man raising a large hammer with a handle as long as a cow, hammering down with force. I quickly turned away, unable to bear to watch. When I asked again, several people were already dismembering the cow with the most skillful techniques. I couldn't help but take a deep breath.</p>
<p>I asked to leave. But the guide said:</p>
<p>"You are really timid, the butchers kill more than three hundred heads every day!"</p>
<p>More than three hundred heads! A big number, I paused for a moment.</p>
<p>Because it was morning, many places were empty, and the butchers were idly chatting. I asked them: "What is the biggest cow you have ever killed?"</p>
<p>"The biggest?" they said happily: "One fathom long, more than a thousand pounds, it was a Singaporean breed."</p>
<p>"How are the cattle sourced, can you tell me?"</p>
<p>"Most of them come from the Jiangbei ports, in the Xuzhou and Haizhou area."</p>
<p>"Do you eat beef?"</p>
<p>Laughing, they all laughed and said: "Of course we love to eat it." Then they asked me back: "What? Does sir not like to eat it?"</p>
<p>I frowned and said to them, "I'm afraid I won't be able to eat anything today."</p>
<p>They laughed again.</p>
<p>Walking to the gate, someone was negotiating the price of selling cattle. I went up and asked, "Isn't this a draft animal?"</p>
<p>"It is a draft animal, sir."</p>
<p>"Draft animal? Sold, not plowing anymore?"</p>
<p>"Hey! There's no peace yet, the fields are hard to plow, so I simply sold it to have more food to eat and more money to pay the grain tax; actually, sir, who would be willing to sell it?" Slaughtering cattle, selling cattle," infinite feelings!</p>
