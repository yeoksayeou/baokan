<h3 id="c41">祝聯合國大會成功 <a href="#c41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>聯合國大會今天在紐約開幕了。全世界五十一國的政治外交家聚首於一堂，又將開始討論如何締造世界和平的艱鉅工作了。全世界人類的視綫都集中在紐約，密切注視着這個國際會議的發展。一般觀察家對於聯合國大會的前途，雖仍多抱着悲觀的看法；但在今日各國人民，企求世界和平的願望，實在太迫切了，只要有一綫希望，終覺得會有豁然開朗的可能，決不表示絕望。各國人民對於聯合國大會的成功，仍抱着無限的期望，所以美國國務副卿艾契遜在聯合國大會前夕，致詞歡迎各國代表，也很率直坦白地說：『美國已以擁護聯合國爲其一貫的外交政策；今後且將勇往直前，賡續採取此項政策而不稍餒。美國政府深信聯合國必能在艱難之長途中，充分進步，而完成世界和平。」這雖是美國外交家口頭的應酬詞令，但足以增强各國代表對於聯合國大會必能成功的信心。</p>
<p>今日世界政局的重心，無疑的，完全在美蘇關係上。聯合國大會成敗的關鍵，亦即在此，甫自巴黎返國的美國國務卿貝爾納斯，向國人報吿二十一國和會的經過情形時宣稱：「目下局勢最可憂慮的地方，乃在美蘇兩國的緊張局勢有增無减，美國對蘇讓步，已至山窮水盡的地步。「但是蘇聯外長莫洛托夫行抵紐約後，就向美國報界發表談話稱：「余相信眞誠與好意，必能達到互相諒解；因此亦相信此次聯合國大會所而臨的工作，必能完成，任何困難，均能迎刃而解。蘇聯代表團對於此次聯合國大會及在下月初旬舉行之外長會議，必能有所貢獻，俾使其完成工作，以增進和平利益及全世界大小各國人民的福利。」這雖然是外交家的應酬談吐，但也足以使世人對於美蘇關係行將好轉的希望，益趨濃厚。所以我們在聯合國大會開幕的前夕，看到紐約充滿了一片祥和光明的景象，實在令人快　，但願世界局勢從此開朗，勿使渴望和平的世人再空歡喜一塲。</p>
<p>我們旣處在這種國際氛圍中，自然也應以愉快的心情的來歡迎聯合國大會的開幕，並以至誠祝聯合國大會的成功，但是緬懷過去，瞻望將來，把目前的國際局勢，作一個全面的分析，終覺得聯合國大會的前途，未容過分樂觀，仍有待各國大智大仁的政治家去努力，排解萬難，而爲世界和平開闢一條康莊大道，茲就所見，願向各國政治外交家進一言。</p>
<p>第一，我們回憶一年半來的國際局勢，只見波瀾迭起，而幾個基本問題，兜了一個大圈子，仍回到了原來的出發點，絲亳沒有獲得解決。這實在是戰後最令人氣短的現象。以歐洲言，自納粹德國無條件投降戰事結束以來，已歷一年有半；即以遠東而論，自日本屈膝乞降至今，也已有一年餘。其間雖有許多政治外交家，竭智盡能，在那裏致力和平，但是眞正的和平，至今還沒有光臨人間，在國際上，由五國外長會而三國外長會議，由聯合國大會而四國外長會議，再由四國外長會議而巴黎會議，現今又將由聯合國大會而四國外長會議了。國際會議之多，在人類歷史土創了一個空前的紀錄，但是這些國際會議的結果如何？我們且作一總淸算，唯一的成就，只有巴黎和會所通過的五部和的軍案而已。其他重要問題，由外長會議討論解決不了，乃移交巴黎和會處理，而巴黎和會仍未能獲致解決，而今又退回外長會議討論了。這抓殘酷的事實，給我們一個珍貴的敎訓，就是締造和平，實非易事，而需要各國的通力合作，始有成功希望。</p>
<p>第二，我們研究和平工作進展遲緩的原因，不能不歸咎於列強不能開誠相見，以致互相猜忌，疑竇叢生，乃造成兩個世界對立的局勢，其實在事實上，蘇聯固然需要和平，不願再見戰爭；此在美國亦需要和平，並痛惡戰爭；雙方的目的既然相同，何以在國際會議中不能合作呢？這顯然是由於雙方互相疑忌所致。中國有句俗話。所謂「不誠無物」，美蘇既不能以誠相見，任何問題，自不能解決。反之，雙方如能開誠布公，無事不可商議，則任何困難，均不難迎刃而解；所謂「誠之所至金石爲開」。莫洛托夫外長在紐約發表談話，亦以此爲言，使我們相信，各國代表尤其是美蘇代表，在這次聯合國大會中，必能以誠相見，捐棄一切意見上的紛歧，而獲致完全一致的協議。</p>
<p>第三，因爲我們盼望聯合國大會能够成功，故不能不指出聯合國機構的缺陷，質言之，就是在它的組織上缺少民主精神。戰後世界旣已步入和平民主的新時代，目前當可視爲民主世紀。世界各國人民不僅要求國內政治的民主化，而且也要求國際政治的民主化。强權政治已是歷史上的陳蹟，決不容許其復活，再度出現於民主世紀的國際舞台上。我們把聯合國憲章仔細加以硏究一番，就可以知道，今日開幕的聯合國大會的機構，有着非常不民主主地方。在它的理論上，聯合國各國，不論大小，不分强弱，在法律上一視同仁完全平等的。但是在安全理事會中，一則有常任理事國與非常任理事國之分，再則常任理事國對於安全理事會所通渦之決議案有行使否決權的特權。凡爲各國所贊成的決議，只要有一個强國（常任理事）表示異議，就不能成立，這是何等不民主的制度！所以我們要盼望聯合國大會能夠成功，並要它成爲維持世界和平的唯一有效工具，則非把否決權撤銷不可。美國國內早已有這種運動的發起，並向世界各國倡導，各國也莫不表示贊成，所表示反對的，唯有蘇聯一國而已。在美蘇關係未改善之前，蘇聯獨持異議，站在蘇聯的立場，固然也有其理由；但至各國以誠相見，各國不復有疑懼之後，蘇聯自然更沒有堅持的理由，使聯合國機構依舊保留着它的致命傷。</p>
<p>要之，這次聯合國大會所討論的問題，除了現行國際爭議而外，並將討論有益於人類福利的各項問題。對於整個人類的前途，均有極密切的關係。所以爲各國利益計，同時也爲世界前途計，這次會議是只許成功而不許失敗的。我們且在這裏，遙祝聯合國大會成功。</p>

<p>七路汽車希望延長</p>
<p>七路公共汽車，已於雙十節通車了。我們虹口的住民，確實得到不少的便利。但是起點在吳淞路口百老匯大厦，因爲沒有電車與公共汽車銜接，我們仍然覺得美中不足。我們大多數的虹口住民，均希望七路公共汽車，再由百老匯大厦，沿蘇州河向西延長到四川路橋。如此過了橋就有十七路無軌常車與二路公共汽車可以搭乘到中區，在交通事業當局旣沒有多大的損失，或者因爲有車銜接，乘客必多而增加收入，但我們得到的便利確實不少，希望當局重加考慮，允予所請。（程全祿）</p>
<p>水菒小販也要活命</p>
<p>我是一個公務員，前日從四馬路江西路口經過，見有一蘋菓生梨小販，在那裏叫賣，忽然來了一輛捉小販之車，將水菓拿去了十分之七的光景，小販哭哭啼啼，躺在那人行道上，痛不欲生！那時有許多人替他可憐！我想那做小生意的，亦是將本求利；目下工廠到處停工，失業者衆，即使開工，也要介紹，倘將本求利的小阪也不能做，那叫他們做什麼呢？他們家中也有妻兒老少，難道看他們活活餓死不成嗎？所以望賢明的當局可能讓那些做淸潔小生意的，暫時苦度光陰，免得絕去生計！（陳文良）</p>

<h3 id="c83">聯國機構大會　重要議題槪覽 <a href="#c83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>〔美國新聞處紐約廿一日電〕聯合國大會議程內之五十三項目，多爲爭取和平世界與富有永久性趣味之問題。首决聯合國大會去冬在倫敦舉行，此决五十一國代表將面臨各種重要問題，諸如設立聯合國託管委會，安理會否決權及各會員國之問題等等。聯合國秘書長賴依昨在聯合國特別節目中播講，强調大會行動之重要性，謂大會爲「聯合國組織</p>
<p>決策之一環，」並籲請各方注意，謂大會除安理會已考慮之問題外，實能考席聯合國　章範圍內之一切問題。考慮各項問題之時間表，規定大會將舉行全會四日，其後各委會即應展開工作，旋再舉行全會，討論各委會之工作進展。星期三之開幕式，及其後之全會，均將在紐約近郊麥克多斯公園舉行；委會會議則將在聯合國臨時所在地成功湖舉行，大會可望於六星期半〔或十二月七日〕後閉幕。在此期間，大會將舉行</p>
<p>四五〇次議，其中約有三十至卅五次爲全會，九十次爲主要委會會議，其餘各次則將爲其他各小組委會會議。預料大會工作百分之七十均將在成功湖完成。全會及委會會議均定於週一至週五上下午及週六上午舉行，星期日將無會議。大會計有六主要委會，或稱爲全體委會，蓋每一委會中均</p>
<p>有五十一國之代表在也。全體委會計爲：政治安全·經濟金融·社會人文及文化·託管·行政預算及法律委會。各委會亦設一十四人指導委員，由主席一人，副主席七人及六主要委會主席共同組成。大會當前首要問題之一，爲附屬區之託管問題，預料聯合國託管委員會將吿成立。迄今爲止，法國已提出關於法屬吐谷蘭與非洲法屬喀麥隆之協定二件。英·比·澳與紐西蘭亦己報吿託管栛定之計劃，而南非聯邦則提議請求准許合併西南非洲之代管領土。聯合國憲章並不規定，</p>
<p>託管委員會會員國之數量，但該委員會必須包括管理託管領土之各國，（五大國之任何一國並不包括在該集國內）另加其他必要之臨時會員國，務使管理託管領土之國家與不管理託管領土之國家數量相等。大會並將決定容納聯合國新會員國之問題。如果遵照安理會之建議，則聯合國機構將因阿富汗。冰島與瑞典之加入，而增多至五十四國；但安理會拒絕保舉阿爾巴尼亞·南愛爾蘭·蒙古人民共和國，葡萄牙與外的以等國，此等國家</p>
<p>加入聯合國之問題，可能提交大會討論，例如澳洲所主張：關於新會員國，應由大會採取第一步行動。預料大會早期辯論問題之一，亦將爲安理會之全部報吿，包括伊朗·希臘·印度西尼亞。叙利亞與黎巴嫩，及弗朗哥西班牙等問題之記錄。大會尙須選舉安理會之非永久會員國，其任期爲二年，以替代荷蘭，埃及與墨西哥。退休之會員國不得立即重選。經濟社會理事會由十八國代表組織，此次大會亦應選出代表，任期三年。</p>
<p>退休之代表爲哥倫比亞·希臘·黎巴嫩·烏克蘭·美國及南斯拉夫。惟在安理會中退休之代表得重選連任。若干政治及安全問題亦亟待大會考慮。澳洲及古巴均提出安理會五常任理事國否決權問題。澳洲一向反對否決權，建議硏討憲章中有關安理會票決方法之規定。古巴則提出兩項建議，其一爲召開大會，廢除否決權，一爲召開人會修訂　章。大會亦將討論</p>
<p>印度聲訴案及蘇聯要求各國報吿其非敵國駐軍情形之建議案。按印度曾提出聲訴，謂南非虐待印僑；蘇聯要求報吿駐軍情形之建議案，則經安理會拒絕列入議程。有關世界各地人民日常生活福利之問題，大會亦將加以考慮；其中包括重建歐洲，中東，非洲及遠東被摧毀地區之建議，及遣送或處置流亡人士及難民之問題。新國際難民組織憲章及其首决五年預算草案，亦經提交聯國大會。大會並將接獲若干有關</p>
<p>國際糧食情形之報告書，內包括糧食農業組織最近會議之報吿書。大會並將應請批准建議案，採取步驟，以完成前國聯未了之國際管制麻醉品工作，此項建議案曾拒絕西班牙政府加入聯合國麻醉品管制機構。此外，聯合國與下列各機關之協定亦須待大會核准：國際勞工機構，聯合國敎育科學文化機構，糧食農業機構，及臨時國際民用航空機構。各代表並將考慮步驟，加速世界衛生機構之設立，並設立國際</p>
<p>兒童緊急基金聯總署若干福利活動之開始，亦將提出討論。巴拿馬去冬向大會第一次會議所提有關人權與自由之宣言草案，當時爲時間所限，今後將採取行動。最後大會，各代表將考應聯合國之財政，一九四六年與一九四七年之頸算。本年度頸算將不到二千萬美元；一九四七年之預算將略增。會員國分担聯合國費用之問題亦將付諸討論。</p>

<h3 id="c95">電上海一靈魂！　上海繁榮的基礎是工業工業發展寄託在電力上 <a href="#c95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>上海工業化的程度，在用電的數字上可以明顯的表現出來。全市的發電總量是十三萬瓩，家用的比率僅佔三分之一，工業用電佔三分之二。而在工業用電之中紗廠消耗了四萬二千瓦，佔去了一半的數量。據趙曾釭局長的推算，戰前紗廠的工作效率比較高，生產每包紗所需的電量是二百度至二百五十度；現在紗廠的效率還沒有完全復原，每包紗的生產，需要三百度的電力。除了紗廠之外，其他各種工業，消耗了本市三分之一的電。從公用局的統計數字看，其餘各工業用電量的次序是：（一）織布業，（二）麵粉業，（三）造紙業，（四）冷藏業，（五）橡膠業，（六）機器業，（七）毛織業，（八）烟草業，（九）綢廠，（十）製油業。公用局有一個供電審査的機構，審査各個工業對於民生的需要性，而決定它們供電的優先程序。目前紗布的產的需要最迫切，所以今後紗廠業用電的數量還要提高。</p>
<p>電廠負擔過重</p>
<p>電力是工業之母。目前上海工業的生產力，所以不能發揮到最高度，電力不足是最主要的原因。現在上海的電廠已經負擔過重，這是一個病像。公用局趙局長在後方工廠復員協會的聚餐會上，具體的說明了這個情形。他說：本市電廠的服務時間，是世界第一；以服務係數而諭，在百分之八十以上。這就是說：電力廠的機器，在一百小時之內，有八十小時以上在工作着！另外一件事實是「過份負擔」。因爲全部的發電量是十三萬瓩，而上海市的用電量，每日夜有兩個時候，高到十五萬瓩。所以今後限制用電是必要的。</p>
<p>增加生產四法</p>
<p>至於今後的電力管制政策，公用局提出了兩句口號：「節省浪費，增加生產」。取消霓虹燈，限制廣吿燈，家庭用電打七折的計劃，都是根據節省浪費的原則而訂定的。至於在增加生產方面，公用局亦有幾個努力的方向。第一條路是在善後救濟總署方面。行總有五隻發電二千瓩的發電機，局方希望有三隻用在上海，解決本市電力的饑荒。行總答允留兩隻，局方正在繼續努力。這面的努力，可以每月增加四千至六千瓩的動力。其次，上海電力公司到明年春天，發電量亦可大增。在敵僞時期內，日本人曾作改造的努力，結果是弄壞了機件，發電量反因之減低。接收以後，公司從美國請來工程師，澈底加以修理和改進。原定十月可以完工的，因爲修理澈底之故，到明年一月方可發電。有一隻重要機器送到美國去修，湊巧趕上美國的大罷工，本定年底完工的，須延遲到明年二月方能運回發電。這都是出乎當局意料之外的，不過希望不會落空，因爲明年二月起，本市可多得三萬七千瓩的電力。第三條路在浦東區，那裏有一家英商蠶絲廠，戰前有發電二千瓩的設備，戰時被日人拆至某地，現在已在搬　。這家工廠自身用電僅八百瓩，所以發電機運　以後，尙有餘電供應浦東區的工業。第四，在閘北方面，現在發電量是四千八百瓩，機器修理之後，可以增高到七千瓩。因爲有這四方面的開源，公用局長很有信心的對後方復員廠家說：到明年春天，本市電荒將大有起色。</p>
<p>軍艦幫助發電</p>
<p>有一件事可以說明公用局對電荒問題之煞費苦心。他們作最大的努力，亦準備着最壞的情勢。萬一本市電荒到沒有辦法時，公用局希望借用黃浦江中美國軍艦的電力。他們的一隻旗艦，大概可以發電四千瓩以上，自用之外，尙可多餘二千瓩。當然這個問題是不簡單的，一隻美國軍艦供應中國城市的用電，這件本司令作不得主，決定權是在美國海軍部。以發電量而論，一隻大軍艦是有力負擔一個都市的需要的。一位留美的海軍軍官對我說：羅斯福號航艦和密蘇里號主力艦的發電量，均數倍於上海的用電量。</p>
<p>電費考慮加價</p>
<p>從公用局長的中中，證實了電費行將加價的傳說。他說：過去的電價規定，是小戶用電五十元一度，大戶七十三元一度，工業用電八十四元一度。事實上，這是虧本生意。公用煤的成本原來是三萬元一噸，現在是八萬元一噸。對於紗廠，公用局特定出「以煤易電」的辦法，折合是每度電費二百元；將這裏的贏餘，補貼供給其他工業的虧損。這不是持久的辦法。以電廠的原料而論，煤與柴油是並用的。自從外匯率調整之後，油價大漲，電的成本亦隨之而高。上海電力公司所用的油，直接自美國運來，成本甚高。目前他們之不即漲價，還是公用局洽商的結果。綜言之，電價的提高是必要的；但提高多少，方屬合理，則尙待硏究。客觀的說，自平民福利言，電費愈低廉愈好；但在今日上海的情形言，電力過廉，家庭間的浪費亦多。</p>
<p>有一部份工業家對於煤的成本問題，深切注意。他們認爲今日香港電價之低廉，是當地電廠使用安南鴻基煤之故。他們主張放寬煤斤統制的尺度，允許越煤來華，成本必然減輕。又一種主張是要發掘本市潛在的電力。例如現在的大紗廠和麵粉廠，本身均有發電設備，但是因爲使用公家的電力來得便宜，因之自備的發電機業而不用。從全市的觀點看，這是可觀的損失，特別在今日的上海，多一度電等於多一分生產。</p>
<p>上海前途樂觀</p>
<p>上海是個工商業大都市，而上海繁榮的基礎，是建築在工業上面。趙局長對上海的前途，作了一個樂觀的展望。他說廿五年之後，上海將是一個擁有七百萬人的世界大都市，不止是中國的「窗戶」。在現有工業區之外，應該再有四個新工業區城——閘北·南市·市中心區·浦東區。現代化的港口將建築在日暉港吳淞口一帶。這操一個工業大都市的美麗遠景，是建立在長江三角洲的形勢上；目光看得更遠一點，是寄托在三峽水力發電的大工程上！上海是中國的神經中樞，而「電」是上海的靈魂！</p>

<h3 id="c112">何玉相身殉國難六年前舊事重提　前萬國商團白俄團丁槍殺孤軍案審結　班長陳述目睹開槍情形律師辯稱殺人不能證實 <a href="#c112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕自俄團丁槍殺孤軍案，昨日下午三時，地院再度開庭審訊，並傅到證人依凡諸夫（前萬國商團白俄隊少校團長）及前四行孤軍中士班長石洪謨，推事吳榮林，檢察官方正，及書記官謝寅生升座後，先詢被吿米奇亞可夫，當民國二十九年九十八日時，孤軍營旁，共有多少崗位，米答：平時僅七崗，因當時局勢堅張，故增加爲十三崗。案發那天，第七崗拉希台維夫亦曾開槍一響，何玉相由何人所發槍彈致死，則不得而知。</p>
<p>白俄團長呈紀事簿</p>
<p>審判長繼訊證人依凡諾夫，據其陳述，當時白俄隊擔任守衛孤軍營者共有三百二十人，民國二十九年「九一八」，本人並不在塲，且彼時並不負責白俄隊，案發後僅從報吿上得悉，米奇亞可夫於上午十二時四十五分開一槍，隔三十秒鐘後，第七崗拉希台維夫亦曾開一槍，且方向相同。依凡諾夫並將當時白俄隊「每日紀事簿」，呈庭作證，以供參考。</p>
<p>砰然一響應聲倒地</p>
<p>孤軍方面證人石洪謨班長供述案情甚詳，略謂：案發前四天已發生不幸事件，白俄施用催淚彈及自來水龍頭，向孤軍攻擊，孤軍盡屬徒手，前後死傷第兄五人，各人姓名因年久不能記憶。此案發生之日爲「九一八」，一早即有民衆來孤軍營慰問，因道白俄隊封鎖，不能入內，至十一時許越聚越多，本人（石洪謨自稱）奉謝團長之命，至門口探視，與被害人何玉相並肩立於一長凳上，向牆外窺視，被吿米奇亞可夫値第一崗，舉槍先後瞄準三次，初二次皆未發射，第三次瞄準約有一分鐘，砰然一槍，何玉相竟應聲倒地。此彈貫穿何玉相頭部，後又擎傷另一士兵高廣雲腿部，因高站立於何玉相後之洗臉木架上，地位極高，故何玉相之死，實由米奇亞可夫槍彈所致。第七崗雖亦開槍，然未傷人。吳推事依證人之言，再詢米奇亞可夫；米否認曾　準三次，並稱一槍傷二人亦不可能·證人具結後，審判長宣佈開始辯論，首由檢察官起立稱；米奇亞可夫槍殺何玉相經過事實，業經證人證明，米奇亞可夫亦已自認開槍，故宜處以殺人罪。</p>
<p>律師解釋當時環境</p>
<p>被告辯護律師劉劍剛起立，首先說明當時之環境，略謂當時日軍逞威上海四郊，屢向租界工部局交涉，接管孤軍，工部局派白俄隊戒備孤軍營，雖明爲看守，實暗中保護。本人會詢諸當時租界工部局主持人樊克令，承吿：當年九月十四日因孤軍未得允許，扯昇國旗，經英駐軍限其三小時下旗，孤軍並不實行，白俄隊奉命施放催淚彈，及用自來水噴射，驅散孤軍，將國旗降下，因此曾造成嚴重事件，及緊張空氣。「九一八」那天，又有羣衆塵集孤軍營四週，米奇亞可夫之第一崗尤衆，米於包圍之下，未免驚惶失措。六年前米奇亞可夫尙不到二十歲，實一未成年之孩童，本律師曾詢依凡諾夫，其時形勢既如此緊張，何不多派崗警防護，乃任一未成年之孩童，負此重任？今被吿雖承認開槍，然不能證實其爲殺人。本案有二點値得注意；（一）何玉相之死，當時因孤軍營謝團長不准白俄入營，故未曾祥細調査，同時開槍者非米奇亞可夫一人，六年後之今日，更不能證實何玉相究死於何人之槍彈。犯罪茲礎既未確定，何能定罪？（二）行爲之本身：米奇亞可夫外受民衆包圍，內有孤軍呼應，形勢自極嚴重，根據孤軍營警衛訓令，崗警如遇脅逼，或有被繳械危險時，可開槍射擊，被吿白俄未受良好教育，對法令之解釋當不十分淸楚，而此法令係由英駐軍頒佈，白俄隊之入伍書中，亦說明一切遵守英國軍隊規律，故被吿之開槍，應否負法律責任，請鈞院裁奪，並請求予被吿無罪之判決，或最輕之處罰。至此審判長宣佈辯論終結，定二十八日下午二時宣判，被吿還押。</p>

<p>— 黃嘉謨</p>
<p>帽子到手鴻飛冥冥</p>
<p>「捉烏龜」便是擔帽子，尤其是名貴的西式呢帽。上海人統稱爲「拋頂宮」，幾乎變成盡人皆知的語詞，此中人卻已放棄不用了。凡是有搶帽特拔的「硬扒」弟兄，他們總是二三成羣，徘徊於電車公共汽車站上，預先看準了靠近車窗的乘客所戴帽子，一俟開車，便沿窗搶奪而去。失主勢不能立刻下車，况且車廂中往往擠得像沙丁魚一般，等乘客下得車來，早已鴻飛冥冥了。在人力車三輪車飛馳之時，那車上乘客的呢帽也是很好的目的物。扒竊黨祇要輕舒猿臂，一摘即得·於是急望反對方向狂奔，乘聞交給了帮手，即有警補追捕，也時常失之交臂。在兩路局火車月臺上也往往有此輩「扒竊黨」在「捉烏龜」。年來路警戒備較嚴，此輩的踪跡，方才不大發見在月臺上。</p>
<p>「硬扒黨」的活動小組都是受着「爺叔班子」所支配，時間和地段均係頸先劃定，而且不是帮外的「洋盤」所得侵入「搶生意」的。</p>
<p>他們下手的時間規定在淸晨，晌午，和黃昏。因爲淸晨是市民塵集在車站的時候，午晚又是馬路上行人來往擁擠，都有利於下手後的脫逃。其活動地點都選擇在支路繁多，或是里弄紛歧之處，由小組中的一位能手進行搶奪，立即在奔，這時失主自必追呼尾追，於是同黨乃冒充爲不相干的路人，攔住失主假作問訊，藉以躭誤失主的時間，並可防止路見不平者的追逐。依此戰略隨機應變，讓那個搶物的同夥，得從容由支路里弄逃出險境，此輩同夥名爲「擋風」。</p>
<p>鬼鬼崇崇花樣繁多</p>
<p>「文差事」乃是「吃壞飯」的第二種，他們不像「硬扒」帮的巧取豪奪，而是鬼頭鬼腦的「鼠竊狗偷」因某行爲比較斯文，故稱爲「文差事」，其活動類別及演出方式有如下列：</p>
<p>（一）翻高頭」——此帮行竊時，總是利用粗繩或木梯，通過了人家的墻頭或屋頂，翻入屋內，然後下手。</p>
<p>（二）「揆扇子」—行竊時用鐵梗小刀撬門而入。</p>
<p>（三）「跑早淸」——民家住宅，大都於淸晨開門倒馬桶，或從事打掃，小竊即於此時乘機掩入，順手牽羊。</p>
<p>（四）「跑燈頭」—又名「烏頭」。在旁晚黃昏之際，住戶大都虛掩後門，小竊便乘機掩入活動·</p>
<p>（五）「上天表」——民家每日在晒臺上凉衣，或在天井曝晒，大都無人看管，小竊用長竹竿把衣裳挑下來，其間乾濕，一律席捲而逃。</p>
<p>（六）「切克子」——凡有住宅將門戶鎖住的，足見其內無人。小竊如果事先探知其家股富，便乘人不備毀鎖入內，從容竊取。</p>
<p>（七）「跑窰堂」—此帮偸竊却不規定時間，其活動方式亦極自由，不問何物，竊得即走。不論何時，得隙即進。而且須有鑒別力，不値錢的東西是不會帶走的。例如走入大戶人家，便注意廳堂上的古玩字畫，鐘屛鼎器之類。</p>
<p>（八）「開桃源」—掘壁洞竊物，又名「開窰口」。</p>
<p>（九）「上閂子」—即橇窗賊。</p>
<p>（十）「下閂子」—即撬門賊。</p>
<p>（十一）「闖窰堂」借問訊問路爲由，乘間闖入民家偸竊。</p>

<p>張昨在庭上供稱：公會理事長會辭職二十餘次，皆因同業之「推戴挽留」而未果。此純爲同業謀「福利」，並無危害國家之事。至民國三十年十二月八日太平洋戰爭起，日人有計劃行動，將本市五金，銅條，銅錫、鋼鐵四同業所有倉庫査封，下令須將存貨登記，在當時環境之下，無法抗拒，乃組織聯合辦事處，以謀對付。該處僅一書記，一茶房，並無委員主任之類名義，僅係各同業日常聚會之所，以謀搶救物資保障工商業，爲國家稍稍保存元氣。該五金辦事處成立後，並未以五金資敵，亦未代敵搜括。因同業既己將存貨向敵人登記，彼要多少，即拿多少，結果敵海軍拿去一千二百噸，敵陸軍拿去七百噸，總約二千噸左右。此事並未經過聯合辦事處，面係各同業單獨之事。至任偽保長，則因在上海稍有地位，故被迫指定担任。民國三十三年時敵僞發動全市保甲舉行獻鐵運動，召開保長大會時，本人未出席，結果由聯保長命令若保長轉甲長專轉各戶，由各戶將　直接送往僞警局，並未經保長辦事處之手。此在當時環境之下，市民亦係逼不得已。本入純爲商人，並無　敵之意，抗戰初期，因七十六號之若迫參加僞組織，曾一度逃往香港’後因同業之堅邀乃返滬維持公會。後曾偸運物資赴內地而爲敵所知，乃北捕非刑拷打，當時祗望天日重光，至今却因漢奸罪被扣已一年多，眞是寃枉到極點。如我是甘心附逆，可請重辦，否則請酌量事實而　罪云。言至此，其在座旁聽之家屬已泣不成聲。審畢，被吿仍由法警押回監獄</p>

<p>答復讀者法律質疑</p>
<p>（一）偽造失票</p>
<p>一鳴問鄙人有法律疑問數點，希詳予解答：民國卅二年，某甲以地產二分央乙爲中，押與先父，廿九年家鄉淪陷後，乙藉惡勢力自甲處收買，該地當時亦未通知鄙人，（現甲已去世），勝利後，鄙人託人向乙交涉乙即串通余之庶母，僞造失票，其中書明從前某甲担抑與先父時，借票已經遺失，款已償還，立此失票爲憑，失票上並蓋有先父遺印，茲有問題數則，請賜解答。（一）原中，買主，俱爲乙包辦，並未通知鄙人，能否加以否認？（二）甲已去世，其產業可否作爲鄙人所有，而申請土地登記？（三）僞造先父失票，可否控訴法庭？（四）先父遺印登報作廢，可否與失票同時作爲無效？</p>
<p>〔曹亞俠律師答〕（一）不可。因不動產所有人，設定抵押權後，得將不動產讓與他人，亦並無一爲設定抵押權之中入，即不能爲買主之規定。（二）不可。因抵押物之所有權逕行移屬於抵押權人，爲法所不許。（三）如確屬偽造，可以偽造文書罪控訴。（四）登報作廢，不能使事前已成立之票據作爲無效。</p>
<p>（二）押地回贖</p>
<p>任承甫問先祖父在民國三年以銀元六十元，押進活契基地一方，即建造房屋，因契約上善明期限五年爲滿，洋到回贖，及屆五年又增加銀元卅五元，復書契約一紙，書明　贖時連同前款一倂歸還，不得短少，十三年又以借據借銀元十元，見月三分生息，事變時房屋被敵人焚毀，直至敵人投降時我欲仍在該地建造房屋，押主則擬回贖，目前我雖勉强造屋，亦難免日後糾紛，究竟是項地產在法律上是否憑該任其回贖？請在貴欄答復。</p>
<p>〔曹亞俠律師答〕査司法院解釋第二五五八號第七款，『淸理不動產典當辦法施行前，設定之典權，定有期限者，不問曾否以契約加長期限，均得於出典滿卅年後二年內回贖』。淸理不動產典常辦法施行於民國四年，本件典權設定於民國三年，自可依據上開解釋處理，至回贖典物之法定期間，因戰事不能遵守者，於復員後辦理民事訴訟補充條例施行後二年內，仍得回贖典物，爲同條例第七條明文規定，故在法律上本件典物猶可國贖。</p>

<p>〔本報訊」國楨盃排球聯賽，昨夜有複賽二幕，俱爲勢均力敵之對抗，攸關錦標甚大，爭鬥劇烈，精彩百出，女組友聯以三對一力克務本，獲得決賽權，男子組則粵剛以二比三敗於蘇聯。</p>
<p>友聯力戰得勝</p>
<p>自王務醴由務本改隸友聯後，後者之實力驟增，似有穩得冠軍之勢，但昨友聯表演，顯然生疏，各個地位，缺少契默。據友聯陳梅貞云，該隊隊員各以職務及學業關係，致疏練習，不無原因。務本在頹勢下，努力作戰，故予友聯之威脅力甚大，友聯勝來煞費苦心，現友聯已擊退務本，將遇友隊決冠軍，依昨戰情形，尙須經過一番努力也。</p>
<p>女組友聯對務本，友聯陸兆珊首先發球，李玻失手，友聯獲分，務本衆將，小心翼翼，比數尙見接近，第一局終，友聯以廿一比十九佔先，第二局中，友聯曾以七比一前導，惟務本力追，反以九比八超出，友聯企圖挽回，奈陸翠芳動作遲緩，弱點顯露，遂爲務本所乘，結果廿一比十四，務本扳成平局。第三局雙方競爭更見熱烈，比數此起彼落，備見緊張，屢度平手後，友聯賴陳梅貞扣壓見功，以廿一比十九再勝務本，第四局務本曾以十一比五領前，友聯力追以十四比十一，後來居上，結果友聯以最後之努力，以廿一比十八勝，總結三對一，友聯淘汰務本。</p>
<p>粵剛慘遭淘汰</p>
<p>蘇聯本有獲取盃賽之決心，聯賽既失，對此國楨盃更具雄心，粵剛亦然，惜以健將鄭亦泉因病不克到塲，損失非淺，粵剛昨敗究全吃虧在們人殺球，蘇聯則壓殺並施，且長力又足，既成二對二，最後一局，粵剛便爾不濟矣。</p>
<p>男子複賽，粵剛與蘇聯登塲，粵剛謹愼從事，比數緊凑，易地時粵剛以十一比十佔先，再戰，雙方短兵相接，結果粵剛以廿一比十六，佔勝第一局，第二局蘇聯力圖振作，獲分累累，以廿一比十二扳成平手，第三局競爭益見劇烈，此起彼落，粵剛以十七追成落後，形勢危急，傾力反攻，追成各廿，奈又以廿一比廿三再失一局，第四局粵剛突見順手，以十一此六佔先，結果粵剛以廿一比十六，收復失地，二造平局，末局雙方小心翼翼，戰局更見緊張，造十一比八，蘇聯更見凶猛，粵剛終以十三比廿一遭慘敗，總結蘇聯以三對二力挫粵剛。</p>

<h3 id="c174">雷霆萬鈞壓張垣一個倖免於全燬的葫蘆與其說是參觀·無甯說是憑弔！ <a href="#c174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>— 十八日北平航訊　本報記者宋紹柏</p>
<p>記者在十八日隨「中外記渚張垣參觀團」由北平到張垣，與其說是「參觀」，毋甯說是「憑弔」。傳長官本月初在綏遠紀念週講話，曾鄭重地說：「雖然打了勝仗，但只有沉痛而無快意，」因爲死亡的都是中國人！」張頃經歷了這次的災難，毀滅的完全是由國的人民和其血汗之所經營。</p>
<p>上午八時半，人們乘上飛機，爲了便利攝影記者，飛機在北平上空繞過二週後，向西北飛去，因爲是上坡路，多走了幾分鐘，到張垣上空繞了一小時。在機上　環山的張垣·像個胡蘆，是個不宜守的地方，不論其北的張北，其西的柴溝堡，西東的宣化，只要一旦被進攻部隊控制，這葫蘆裏的守軍，必須考慮及早撤出。張垣這個「葫蘆」之得以倖免於全燬，似乎與它的地勢不無關係。</p>
<p>張垣有二個機塲，楡林堡的一個較大的已經被共軍澈底破壞。在機上看見洋灰跑道，已被炸得遍體鱗侮，我們便降落在較小的姚官屯機塲上。坐上十二戰區預爲準備的卡車入市，沿途看見了刧後的張垣。</p>
<p>市民惡夢方醒</p>
<p>車行街上，看見兩側排列的一眼望不到頭的歡迎民衆。記者們似乎感覺到興奮，但那些坐在地上的人，並沒有站起來，更聽不到歡呼，細看那三角旗上寫的却是「微迎勞苦功高的陳總長」。記者們明白了。那些民衆一個個呆呆地沒有什麼表情，看不出是喜歡是苦惱，好像惡夢方醒，還沒有淸楚過來。大多數商店住戶門上插着國旗，顏色與縐紋都不像才做的。後來問一個商人，他說過去是不常掛的，舖戶門口也立着不少人，大家似乎都在茫無頭緒的看熱鬧，除去淸理斷瓦頹垣的人有工作和成列的小攤等待懷有法幣的軍人照顧外，很少看見人有工作。小商店雖都開市，但呈現着一片冷淸。市民們還沒有法幣買東西，「邊幣」則失去效用了。標話已經煥然）新，佈吿牌上，貼上了「張家口警備司令部佈吿」。每一佈吿前都圍上一堆人。「解放大飯店」，「新華書店」，「晉察冀……」的牌匾，高懸未去，但有的己經被火燒焦。慶豐大戲院門前標出「今日開始演戲，」妓館的「××書院」「××閣」照舊開着。這裏已經看不見「蒙攝」時期的絲毫陳跡，他替的是我們自己的破壞與殺擄。</p>
<p>車站破壞最慘</p>
<p>破壞最慘的是車站，偌大的一長列建築。完全燒了。車皮燒焦，車頭與重頭互撞，未毀的機器凑成了一個車頭，預定今天先用此車頭使穴化張家口間通車。發電廠完全破壞，大街上拖着隧地的電綫，但也收拾好了一個小發電機。傳長官辦公的地方，十七日起恢復了電燈。自動電話機完全燒燬。據說以此項恢復最難。廣播電台重要機件，已被運走，最近可恢復一小型電台。最徼倖的是向來水，這是那廠子的工人救了它，通地雷的火綫被入偷偸卸去了。</p>
<p>隨部隊的進駐，張垣已經成立一個「十二戰區臨時政務委員會」辦理善後政務，主任委員是十二戰區政治部副主任周鈞·這個委員會的常前急務，的有下列幾點。土地產權問題，婚姻問題，共黨工作人員的自白自首，貨幣的整理，緊急救濟等問題。</p>
<p>恢復土地產權</p>
<p>關於土地產權問題，傳長官已經得到中央的指示，原則上只要所有人提出證據，（失去證據者，可由隣人作證。）無論經過如何的「鬥爭」，可恢復其所有權。但爲了顧及耕作人的損失，也承認耕作人的使用權與收穫權，地租不許超過全收穫量的百分之十五。如果經過二次以上的「鬥爭」，則最初耕作者，應得百分之卅五，中間耕作者，應得百分之卅五，收穫者應得百分之廿五，地主仍舊是百分之十五。這一過沒辦法，維持到今年底，以後將根據土地法，實行「限地政策」。預定計劃是每人約合廿畝，五口之家，最多不許過二百畝，地租將較二五减租的辦法更少。根據實際情形，定成與現在的過渡辦法大致相同的標準，亦即地租應不超過百分之十五或十。據臨時政委會主委周鈞說：此種限制地租辦法，在綏柬綏西已見諸實行。綏西是百分之十，綏東是百分之十五，全省實行者約佔三分之一地區，也還沒有多大困難。不過察省將來實行限出辦法，困難的是中央的地方能否籌出如許多的款子收買地主的土地，分給無地者。據他的推斷，地方可籌百分之十或二十。所以明年能否有效的實行此一政策，還不能斷定。但據周氏表示：爲了實踐民生主義，對抗共黨的一套，這是必要而刻不容緩的。</p>
<p>貨幣問題麻煩</p>
<p>貨幣問題也是當前比較麻煩的問題，共黨發行的「邊區券」，己禁止行使。現在所有的是十二戰區隨軍帶去的四千萬法幣，小額幣的缺乏，也需要立刻解決。所以長官部貸給了商會二千萬，並准其發行臨時小額流通券，十八日已開始行使。張垣的物價還米受刺激，麵粉每斤四百元，大米五百元，白布九萬元一匹，但人們恐懼着交通恢復後貨幣不缺時的上漲，會是驚人的，因爲張垣實際上已經沒有多少東西。中央銀行有人與記者等同機到了張垣，籌備設立分行　婚姻問題較易解決，已定出的原則是無問題者聽其自由，有問題者以女方意見爲主。</p>
<p>辦理工人登記</p>
<p>張垣的失業工人，還沒有統計起來。連同宣化龍烟煤礦工人算起當不下萬餘人。其他因戰爭而急需救濟者尙多。對於工人，臨政會決定即日起登記，光使之整理殘破的工廠，日給以千元至一千五百元，等於以工代振。此外，行總亦有五人與記者等同機到張，帶去了四千萬現鈔，辦理急振。</p>
<p>自白白首運動很有效。自白自首者已有二千五百多人。當局宣佈：只要自白自首，並獲得保甲的保證，即予以自新之路，不咎既往，同時禁止報復行爲。收復張垣已一週，尙未見報復行爲發生。一般民衆似乎已經都很開明，這一點當局認爲很好。</p>
<p>教本發生恐慌</p>
<p>張垣原有小學四十餘所，學生的萬人，經此變更，未受太大損失，都己經恢復開課，中共敎科書已廢止，可是新敎科書尙無着落，這是一個急待解決的問題·中等以上的學校，以前有男女市立中學，農科職業學校，商科職業學校，鐵路學院，醫科專門學校，工業專門學校，及回民中學。內蒙軍政學院，學生的二千人。此外，有華北聯合大學，（延大，魯藝，外語，及教育學院合併者）學生數字不詳·這些中等以上學校的學生，共軍撤退時，都已自動或被迫隨軍撤出·據十二戰區長官部的王秘書說，隨共軍撤出的學生約共六千餘人，其中有八百人，在路上以思想不良的名義槍殺了。現在有一部分已陸績回來。共黨晋察冀日報撤退前一日還出版，臨走將日本遺留在華北三部大型滾洞機之一的機器毀成了廢鐵。歸綏的奮鬥日報，前三天出版了張垣版。</p>
<p>將軍態度謙和</p>
<p>在張垣，我們會見了傅作義和董其武將軍，他們都穿了一身和士兵完全相同的草綠色軍服，他們沒有以勝利爲光榮，態度很謙和。傅長官希望記者們隨便和任何一個人接觸，以便知道張垣前後的眞實情形。傅長官的秘書長王明德先生陪記者跑了半天，他說：十二戰區的官兵精神是「待遇儘管不同生活必須一致，」不許有小廚房，衣食住行操作官與兵完全一致。記者也沒有看出二樣來。</p>

<p>— 十一日桂林航訊　本報記者梁小中</p>
<p>最富於神秘性的草如左江一帶女郞「招郞入舍」的情形，爲了生活的需要，許多女人往往看中一些異鄉的孤客，然後把他贅入家中，委身而事，（自然這些女人都已經從自己的勞力里積下了不少的錢），偶然丈夫思鄉心切，要回鄉一行，這便產生了「放罍」的故事，妻子會盡量把丈夫供給得無限的闊綽而「衣錦榮歸」，然而却嚴厲地可囑了地底歸期，假如依期回到妻子家裏，自然沒有甚麽事情，萬一逾期不返，十九都會肚皮腫漲而駕鶴西游·這些香艷而又恐怖的傳說，至今還流行在廣西境裏，成了稗官野史筆底絕好材料。</p>
<p>南國遐荒的傜家女郞，在謌舞和愛情的伊甸園裏生長。歌唱是她們的春天。她們底甜夢，萬壑千山里的幽林溪測，平原上放目千尋的芳草河岸，到處是不同的語言，到處有嘹亮的歌聲，那末柔和，純眞而又可愛。桂東南一片廣大山村的婦女，永遠熱情地崇拜着一個歌唱的女神，　往着她底歌喉的神話，相傳謌仙的名字呌做劉三妹，是鬱江河畔貴縣的龍山鄉人，（她底名字正和昭耀百世的民族英雄翼王石達開一樣深印在貴縣人的心里，引爲無上的光熒），這農家的美麗姑娘，生來便愛唱山歌，不論收牛，插秧，耘田，割茅草……甚麼時候都可以聽見她那嬌迷的聲音，廻蕩在靜寂的天空里。一曲河梁，幾聲嚶啘，沈醉了壯健的少年，撩逗着青春的少年，帶下了大地的微笑……然爾，醜惡的命運却給她帶來了一個嫂嫂的欺凌，磨折和嫉忌，一心要殺害這無邪的小姑，於是，有一天借着砍柴爲名，把三妹帶到一個非常峻峭的山巔，然後把她向前一推，滿以爲結束了三妹的性命和歌聲，那知道正在三妹懸空墜下的時候，却抓到了一根十年古籘，搖曳在萬丈深谷的中間，面對着急湍奔湃的溪水，三妹的歌聲又響了：「嫂嫂要害劉三妹，多謝一根千年籘」，歌聲正完，峭壁上的一扇石門，「呀」地一聲開了，劉三妹便帶着歌聲，走入了洞門，成了歌仙。故事輕鬆而又有趣，劉三妹的靈魂永生在姐兒們底心上，多少人在唱着「不信但看劉三妹，歌唱應過九重山」。歌唱不但應過九重山，歌唱還是多少婚姻自由底山國裏面女郞的撮合山。臘盡春圍，梅冷桃艷底時候，偶然一次山村空前的節目，（譬如農厂的春節，桂西傜區的盤古　，萬岡一帶的擲蛋節……整個鄉村的男女，完全沉浸在瘋狂的歌舞裏，明月照人，流水度曲，平地一陣山風掠過，妙受的愛　嘹繞着幽深的松林，女的唱一個：「天上星星滅又明，一條銀河冷淸淸，誰人數得天星　，我便插翼飛上天。」男的答一個：「天上星星夜夜明，不是阿哥數不淸，最怕數到天星盡，阿味不把銀河行」。一酬一唱，委娜斯和邱必特底情箭便輕輕地插入他們底心房裏，等到月落烏啼，曉烟催人的時候，多少情侶，早已手携着手，踏入女孩子父親的家里，說個明白，跟着便是一番禮聘，（桂西南的傜人要若千頭牛和白米，大籘山傜區則喜歡要數百塊雪白的龍洋，說起大籘山傜區，至今還有一個金綉傜王的「駙馬爺」，是以前省府的紅人，不過這駙馬之所以能够「尙主」，却不是由唱歌而由宣慰得來），於是，多謝歌仙的遺響，又一對有情人成了眷屬，這是傜國的春色，也是山地的一頁詩篇。</p>
<p>然而，悲喜劇的收塲，往往是女人遭受着最可痛的犧牲，兩年來的戰火和災荒摧殘了廣西的軀體，六百多萬的婦女担受了加倍的苦痛，草根和樹皮塞斷了她們天眞的歌聲，飢餓和貧困成脅着她們丈夫和兒女的生存，多少純潔的靈魂出賣了賤價的肉體，多少導上的明珠無可奈何變了別人的婢妾，無限的哀愁敎她們流不盡林黛玉一樣的眼淚，空虛的肚皮，敎地們過着比趙五娘更可悲的生活。蒼天究竟賜了些甚麽幸福給廣西的女人？</p>

<h3 id="c177">訪中·主黨和·席尢永昌 <a href="#c177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>— 十二日廣州航訊　本報特派員梁風</p>
<p>「中國中和黨」這個名字，過去似乎是很少見到的，相信不少人感到這個黨有點陌生，所以當這裏報章披露中和黨領袖抵穗的消息時，市民們街談巷議地惴測着：大槪又是一個什麽新的政黨產生，連記者也有同樣的感覺，於是在一個秋高氣爽的下午，記者懷着好奇的心情，走到新亞酒店七一五號房間裘，訪問該黨主席尢永昌先生·</p>
<p>尢先生，現年已六十一歲，他的面型瘦削，顴高腮陷，眼凹準隆，頭上的白髮，和唇問掛着的銀鬚，顏色配合得很調和；常他接見記者時，總是笑容可掬地、使人的一種感覺，是在和一位慈祥的長者談話。</p>
<p>沈冼尢三姓本是一家人</p>
<p>尢先生的姓氏，本來是尤字沒有頭上那于點的「尢」字，所以許多人的讀法都不同，有人　尤字，也有人讀汪字音；記者遂先以此請教，他就解釋這個姓氏的來源，他說他們的始祖本來是沈的，後來經過一次變亂，旗人柬離西散，便分作沈，洗，尢三姓，其實都是、一家；他們的原籍本是江蘇無鍚，後來尢姓便寄籍在廣東的順德縣了。至於這個尢字，應談讀作與注同音，但大家都叫我做尤先生，那我祗好姓「尤」了。他祗是說明他的姓氏，也不怕麻煩的說了好幾分鐘，從這裏也可以見到，他是一個健談的人物。</p>
<p>中和黨黨史已垂六十年</p>
<p>談話轉到正題，尤氏對記者關於中和黨的黨史和現况的詢問，便作以下的槪述：</p>
<p>「中和黨是先父尢列創於淸光緒年間，成立於丁丑年三月十九日，歷史已垂六十年。當時是繼興中會後與先總理同一主義而分別組織的政黨。孫尢二先生是同年誕生，同時起義，同時逃亡東京及南北美洲，游說革命；當時淸廷號爲革命四大寇的，就是總理，先父，和陳少白，楊鶴齡兩先生等四人。中和黨數十年來，是由先父尢列領導，先父逝世後，海內外諸同志即推本人承繼。現有黨員約三百萬人，以南洋羣島各埠僑工佔多數，然國內亦不少，長江以北各省約佔三十萬，廣州現有黨員雖未作正確調査，但相信總在中萬以上，因爲中和黨的黨員多數是「世襲」的，所以祇會增加不會减少。抗戰開始，本人曾從香港走曲江桂林等地，發動黨員參加抗戰工作。曾一度爲了交通斷絕，和各地黨員失了聯絡，現在正打算重新調査，實行振興黨務；目前中央執行部是設在香港九龍，不久即遷至上海。」</p>
<p>歴史性國璽將獻呈政府</p>
<p>尢先生口若懸河地，一勁兒說了一大遍，似乎越說更越興奮，臉上露着很得意的顏色。接着，他又說：</p>
<p>「本人此行是來視察中和然在廣州的黨務，不日即偕同中和黨籍的國火代表赴京，將『中華民國萬歲』國璽，在國民代表大會時呈獻國民政府。這國　是在光緒廿八年，總理與先父在東京擬定國號曰『中華民國』時所刻用的；璽是象牙質，約有一方寸大小，刻有『中華民國萬歲』六個篆字，頂有兩獅子，非常精緻。西曆一九〇一年元旦日，中和黨在東京舉行第一次大會時，開始啓用；後來在蔣主席五一壽辰時，也曾用過，以外就很少用的·」</p>
<p>遲遲獻國璽係秉承庭訓</p>
<p>他說完了這一段，倒使記者有點疑問。因爲這既然稱做國璽，那何以不早呈獻給國民政府呢？他的解答是這樣：</p>
<p>「先父早擬將此璽呈給總理，德理以此乃國家至寳，囑先父在完成國民革命，國民大會召開時始交出；民廿五年，中央電召先父入京，共商國是，先父即擬在其時呈獻於國民大會，以示隆重；可是後因國難嚴重，國大停開，先父不幸逝世首都。彌留時，囑余必須於國大揭幕時呈獻，所以保留到現在哩！」</p>
<p>最後他又說：「先父爲開國元勳，革命功績彪炳，畢生公爾忘私，淡泊明志，生前與鄒海濱，居覺生，戴季陶諸先生甚友善，自逝世後在京公葬，友好並在港創立尢烈紀念中學，此校是蔣主席題贈校名的。現粵方同志亦有在此設立分校之擬議，而本人亦感覺，在此建國期間，作育英才，實爲當前的急務！」</p>
<p>他似乎感慨地說了這一段時，記者還想發問，而尢氏已有其他的應酬，記者便祗好辭退了。</p>
<p>對時局意見發表十言張</p>
<p>最後，記者在這裏想順便報吿一件事，中和黨會於本年九月九日，十國府蔣主席對時局意見書一通。內容雖未發表，但該黨對目前政見會公開發表，有十大主張，內容爲國家民族至上，復員建設第一，應即停止內戰，相誠協向國她是。</p>

<p>美國最近曾在兩個國際會議中力爭着攸關歐洲和平的一個問題—開放一七五〇哩長的多瑙河以供國際貿易無限制便用的問題。在巴黎和會中，在蘇聯反對之下及美國撤回各項特殊建議以後，通過了一個召集多瑙河國際化特別會議的含糊的提案。同時在成功湖那裏，聯合國經濟社會委員會通過了一個大同小異的美國提案。但是在蘇聯控制下的各國曾經揚言拒絕參加反對他們單獨管理多瑙河的任何國際會議。</p>
<p>因此這一個問題不免再度發生，使聯合國難於應付。以下是美國「新聞週報」的柏林特派員霍華德從維也納發出的一篇通訊，詳述這一個複雜問題背後的種種重因素。</p>
<p>維也納人有一名根據史特勞斯華爾茲舞曲編成的諷刺妙語，叫做「美國佔據維也納森林，蘇聯佔據藍色多瑙河」。理由是：美國官員及其眷屬居住在維也納城美國佔領區中「維也納森林」裏的徽發房屋中，而從上奧地利恩斯到黑海的一段多瑙河及其支流則在蘇聯控制之下。</p>
<h3 id="c179">美國控制五分之一 <a href="#c179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>— 佐溪譯</p>
<p>實際上美國控制着多瑙河全長的五分之一，包括自凡登堡州烏爾穆城至奧國美佔領區內的林茲一段狹隘的多瑙河上游，由此沿南岸至恩斯，在那裏蘇聯人置有水底電綫。在此林茲以上的一段河中，美國人擁有多瑙河船隊的三分之一，該船隊包括奧·捷·南·匈·法·保·羅及養國船舶九百七十一艘，這些船隻曾在大戰最後數月中載運撤退德僑及供應物，或在大戰結束以後向上游逃避以免被蘇軍俘獲。其中三十四艘是載客輪船，一百零五艘拖船，五十五艘摩托駁船和油槽船。其餘是普通駁船·油糟船和起重機船等雜色船隻。</p>
<p>美國工程師已把德國境內從林茲到黎根斯堡的河道淸除，並設有多瑙河輪船公司三家，經理二百九十六哩長美國佔領區內一段河流的航務。那三家公司便是粵國多瑙河輪船公司（DDSG），巴威勞愛德輪船公司及粵國所有而荷蘭特許的科莫斯輪船公司。九七一艘船隻中三百九十艘爲多瑙河輪船公司資產，該公司在蘇聯佔領區內所有的船隻和其他設備在去年冬間被蘇車根據波茨坦協定認爲「德國資產」而予以沒收，該公司乃請求　國人在多瑙河輪船公司的主權問題未獲解決以前，勿將船隻放出行駛。該公司要求蘇方繳還被蘇方沒收的碼頭設備和船隻二百二十艘。奧國議院雖已將該公司收歸國有，而該公司現已變成奧政府的資產，但蘇聯繼續以多瑙河輪船公司名義佔有並運用這些船隻和設備。</p>

<p>維也納人有一句成語，叫做情人眼裏的多瑙河始終是藍色的。但是事實上這條像死蛇般盤繞維也納城的油灰色的河流，瞧不見一些藍色的成份。從天空俯瞰，它像一條蒼蠅紙，上面黏附着破敗不堪的碼頭和堆棧，散佈着坍陷的橋樑，各種下沉船隻的突出水面的船身。維也納人喜歡聚集在河岸一帶，於樹蔭下休息讀書，甚至有赳赳武夫泅泳於此河流中。可是從林茲到維也納以下的一段，完全是發臭的死水，並無船隻行駛其間。維也納港口有着長亙十哩的船塢和碼頭，在戰前每年要呑吐一百七十萬噸的船舶，現在却淤塞而死寂了。</p>
<p>照蘇聯人講，多瑙河的咽喉是在圖倫的那座橋樑，距離維也納約十五哩，曾被希特勒的禁衛軍所破壞，五節橋樑全部折斷而陷落在河中。把岡倫橋從河底起出，須在危險的湍流中進行，必須要有特殊訓練的工程師，工人和水底設備，這一切蘇聯都付諸闕如。據奧國工程師估計，在正常的狀態下，有適當的工具和勞力，這頂橋可在三十天至四十天的時間內完全起出，但是蘇聯入只用一座起重機和少數奧國工人，歴時九個月，只起出了一節橋樑。</p>
<p>停頓狀態</p>
<p>本年七月第二星期，設在匈京布達佩斯的蘇聯多瑙河航運總部通函蘇聯控制下的各輪船公司，宣佈　維也納至黑海的一段多瑙河已經暢通，各公司只須在廿四小時以前預先通知，以確定天氣及河流暢通情形，即可自由運用該段河面。已經接受蘇聯此項建議的只有捷克輪船公司，是爲了從保加利亞載運木漿二千噸至捷克勃拉底斯拉伐。</p>
<p>在勃拉底斯拉伐以下，關於航行的危險程度，關稅章則，邊界檢查，各項捐稅，裝卸費等種種實情，不甚了了，而且有種種限制。甚至連蘇聯控制的範圍如何也在不可知之列。</p>
<p>多瑙河上並沒有經常的商業運輸。在保加利亞，羅馬尼亞和南斯拉夫境內行駛的船隻只有三百艘，在匈牙利境內行駛的約有三十至五十艘。但是因有水雷和障碍物的危險，運輸範圍僅限於單程交易，且冒着大險。英美官方深知蘇聯現正控制着通至黑海的北部河口，可是他們承認到於其他兩個河口及黑海口岸蘇里那的情况全然不知道。</p>
<p>這是一個很顯明的事實二戰前的多瑙河是中歐七個國家的貿易大動脈，往來行駛的全部船隻總計約三千艘，每年裝卸三百五十萬噸至四百萬噸的船貨，可是現在却陷於停頓狀態了。當歐洲正期待着和平解決之際，這七個國家本來可藉多瑙河貿易以重建其崩潰的經濟，現在却靠着聯總的救濟品和少數的貨運以苟延殘喘。</p>

<p>— 儲玉</p>
<p>巴黎和會結束了，各國代表相率返國，熱鬧了二個月又十八天的巴黎，頓時冷落了下去；而世人的視綫也從巴黎移到大西洋的彼岸紐約了。不但有聯合國大會定於本月廿三日在紐約開幕，而且四國外長會議也定於下月四日在紐約舉行。美國現正鬧着肉荒，一般人民「食無肉」，而今又來了大批國際貴賓，美國當局，不得不竭誠款待，　以佳餚，　荒更要嚴重了。</p>
<p>和平不易何日締成</p>
<p>我們暫且閉目遐想，即可知締造世界和平，實在不是一件容易的事情。歐洲戰事結束，迄今已一年有半，太平洋戰事吿終，也已一年有餘，可是眞正的和平，還沒有光臨世間；各國的政治外交家，雖在那裏爲和平奔走，橫一個國際會議，豎一個國際會議，千方百計，務使戰後的世界，早日恢復正常狀態，而使各國均能共享和平，不復遭遇侵略戰爭的威脅；但是一年半來的努力，僅僅完成了對義·羅·匈·保·芬五國的和約草案，而其他重要的問題，因爲四國外長會議未能解決，移交巴黎和會討論，巴黎和會未能解決，現又移交四國外畏會議處理。這等於兜了一個大圈子，回到了原來的出發點。間題的本身，依歸如故，未能解得絲毫解決。世界各國的人民，因爲受了這次大戰的浩刦，痛定思痛，企求和平的願望，實在太迫切，只要有一綫希望，終盼望其能豁然開朗。最初把一切希望，寄托在外長會議，等到幻滅之後，又把希望寄托在巴黎和會；現在巴黎和會又使世人感到幻滅的悲哀；可是世人的希望，又移轉到聯合國大會，甚至未來四國外長會議了。</p>
<p>世人的視綫，隨着希望而移轉，但是和平和平，究竟在那裏？依舊是一個猜不透的啞謎·</p>
<p>和會尾聲一個插曲</p>
<p>巴黎和會的末次會議，由我國代表團代理團長郭泰祺主持，替和會歌頌了一番，並盼望各國消除成見，爲和平而努力。美國國務卿貝爾納斯也說：『各國應互相認識，任何一國固不能在戰爭中單獨獲勝，同時也不能在平時單獨獲致和平。各國必須和衷共濟，爲人類造福。』其後英國外相貝文，蘇聯外長莫洛托夫，亦也相繼發表演說，最後由法國外長比杜爾致閉幕詞。和會就此吿終。在這一天的會議席上，却沒有看見南斯拉夫的代表，據其投函末次大會主席郭泰祺，竟謂南國不贊成和會所通過的對義和約，巳決定退出和會了。巴黎和會的成就，巳够平凡了，最後還要暴露出一大弱點，實在太令人氣短了。</p>
<p>時局重心仍在美蘇</p>
<p>聯合國大會已決定如期開寡，四國外長會議也將在紐約舉行，因此大　都要問：會不會有良好的結果，我們的答覆是：『成敗的關　仍在美蘇關係上』。所以世人對於貝爾納斯於十八日發表的演說，都特別重視。演詞內容，有下列各點：（一）美國人民願向蘇聯伸出友誼之手；（二）外傅美國向蘇聯採取包開政策，此說全出於幻想；（三）促進美蘇諒解，殆爲今日政治外交家最感棘手的工作；（四）美國仍將反對個別同盟政策；（五）目下國際局勢最可憂慮者，乃在美蘇關係，已至山窮水盡。</p>
<p>貝氏的一番話，不但杜魯門總統完全同意，就是他的政敵華萊士也表示滿意，而認爲貝氏已有進步，但仍希望他續有進步。參議員范登堡所發表的演說，也擁護貝氏的政策，他說：『蘇聯既不願戰爭，美國亦不願戰爭，希望大家都不要再談戰爭。美國的外交政策，實爲和平政策，若不遭受國內的破壞，必能成功。』</p>
<p>貿易會議在英舉行</p>
<p>美國發起召開的國際貿易及就業會議，自十五日起，即在倫敦樂行預備會議，討論美國的建議，到了十九國的代表，蘇聯並未參加。美國代表魏爾柯克斯對於復興世界經濟，提出五項基本原則；（一）大量减低關稅壁壘；（二）各國互相交换貨物；（三）對於各國進口貨，不應予以歧視；（四）各國應保持高度的就業率；（五）各國在國際市塲上，一律平等。</p>
<p>我們研究美國發起此項會議的眞正動機，乃在恢復戰後國際貿易的自由，在原則上雖爲各國所同意；但是在事實上，仍有困難，第一是蘇聯的不參加，所謂國際貿易的範圍，不免太狹小了，第二是英法一時不能取消其對於進口貨的限制；第三是經濟落後的國家，欲實行工業化，非採取「適度的保護」不可。第四是美國倡導國際貿易自由運動，似不免帶有經濟的帝國主義的色彩·</p>
<h3 id="c182">比國外長史巴克達小國間的折衝要人 <a href="#c182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>— 家南譯自『世界報告雜誌』</p>
<p>比利時外長史巴克現在是大小國間的一個重要折衝者·聯合國全體大會於十月廿三日在紐約開會時，他將再度出任主席。這位社會主義政治家的工作原則，就是實是求是。年輕的時候，他是一個社會運動的鼓動者，曾經搗毀過保守派報紙的窗戶，但是年齡和責任心逐漸使他變成一個富有理智的人物，並具提倡理智·譬如在巴黎和會中，澳洲外長伊瓦特使用直率的言語來迫使四强讓步，可是史巴克則用和緩的言語和妥協的辦法。</p>
<p>大國對於伊瓦特所提過半數決議對於四强應有約束力量的要求，斷然加以拒絕。但是當規程委員會主席史巴克建議大國對於三分之二多數過通的主張應自動予以採納的時候，他獲得美國務鄉貝爾納斯的支持。</p>
<p>史巴克擔任國際會議主席的時候，鎭靜而準確，眞是代表客觀性和公正態度的典型人物。他在一九二二年曾代表比利時參加國際網球比賽，球　車越，現在他在會議席上說話拔巧之靈活俄美，眞可以和　的　　媲美·</p>
<p>圓通辦法</p>
<p>在史巴克擔任主席的時候，辯論往往不致於弄僵。在四强面臨僵局的情形之下，這位比利時外長時常可以提出圓通的辦法。</p>
<p>在巴黎和會中，史巴克曾經和各國代表講過他們的爭執不休，會使世界上的人們想他們不是在規定對軸心國的條件，而在爭諭他們本身中間的和平問題。</p>
<p>史巴克擔任主席的時候，決不容許任何代表取巧，他在處理會議工作時，對於規則精神比對規則的文字更其重視。會議中如因混亂而發生失訣時，他的態度是寬容的，可是如其有人故意破壞規則來達到有利於自己的目的時，他的態度却極堅決。</p>
<p>史巴克在靑年時代曾經領導過社會主義者招搖過市去搗毀右翼報紙的窗戶。在二十年　　當過出色的律師而第一次引起人家的注意。他爲共產主義者辯護，並且替青年社會主義者著作火氣極重的小册子和演說。但是當他在卅九歲出任比利時首相時，他已是社會黨右翼的領袖和共產黨的對頭了</p>
<p>傑出人材</p>
<p>史巴克是比利時第一個著名社會主義女議員的兒子。他的父親是一個詩人，曾經寫過當時最成功的劇本。一九三八年，他出任比利時首相。</p>
<p>在第二次世界大戰中，史巴克逃到法國而遭維希政府拘禁。其後又逃到西班牙而爲弗朗哥所扣留。他越獄而出，喬裝和尙，經葡萄牙而抵倫敦，重新參加比利時政府。</p>
<p>史巴克於一九三二年第一次被選入議會，一九三五年出任內閣閣員，翌年擔任外交部長。從那時起，他幾乎一直擔任這個職務，現在他是自由，社會，共產三黨聯合內蘭的外長。</p>
<p>一九三七年史巴克曾參加里奧波特國王的談判，結果使比利時擺脫了對法國和英國的軍事聯盟。但是孤立主義並沒有使比利時避免侵略，猶如在第一次世界大戰中中立並沒有使比利時逃過危機一樣。</p>
<p>可是史巴克和里奧波特國王不同，他出亡國外繼續抵抗。今日他已經反對里奧波特的向納粹屈服，不贊成他回國。史巴克現在主張和英法維特密切關係，成立聯防協定，但是他堅決聲明這並不是組織「西方集團」之謂。</p>
<p>這一種政策使蘇聯反對他担任聯合國全體大會主席。可是在看到史巴克的實際行爲之後，蘇聯方面也不得不承認他是一個出色的主席。</p>
<p>在聯合國全體大會於十月廿三日在紐約開會時，他又將以大小國間折衝者的姿態出現各國的代表之前了。</p>
<h3 id="c183">日本戰敗言因　日記者加藤透露投降前三島真相 <a href="#c183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>日本著名新聞記者現任共同通訊社主筆加藤近著一書，名「戰敗記」，已於最近出版，內稱在原子炸彈降臨日本以前，美國的潛水艇早已給予日本以重大的打擊，在原子彈轟炸廣島以前一個月，日皇裕仁便想假手蘇聯覓求和平。在此以前日本更時時向中國試探和平。加藤用尋常新聞報導筆法寫他的文章，開頭便這樣寫着：「日本早已在臨死前的痛苦中掙扎着，第一顆原子炸彈的猝然降臨廣島，不過是促其死命的最後一擊而已。世界最新最猛烈的武器從夏天的空中浮現而出，只一擊就把那城市毀滅了，可是它的出現對於日美戰爭的結果倒並沒有多大的影響。」</p>
<p>加藤向聯合國讀者力言日本極權主義的錯誤，他歷述日本陸軍海軍和民衆的互相猜忌，日本熟練工人的管理不得法，以及戰爭各方面的拙劣的計劃，他又嚴酷地批許，在日本瀕於崩潰之際，日本陸軍猶岡故作鎭靜粉飾太平的那種可笑的姿態。他更叙述日本報紙的奴化情形，當其一旦恢復其自由時，竟至無所措手了。</p>
<p>八月十四日，內閣和其他領袖舉行的歷史性會議，首由首相檢討一般局勢，其後陸軍和海軍總參謀長以及陸相即籲請日皇重申國策繼續戰爭。至此內閣秘書引證日皇之言說。「假如別人並無意見表示，我們將表示我們的意見。我們決心要你們同意這一點……我們認爲詆剩一條路可以使日本得救。」</p>
<p>加藤對於日美雙方的宣傳加以批許稱：「照我私人的見解，日本在菲律濱的宣傳最爲失敗，在緬甸的宣傳最爲成功，成功主要的由於種族的呼籲與諾言。失敗由於不能把英美的潮流取而代之，以及不能或不願履行諾言。尤其在菲律濱那裏，隨着美國汽車，冰箱和摩登設備的來源突吿斷絕，使土人對於日人之侈談共榮很快的失去了信心·」</p>

<p>— 張蔭槐</p>
<p>蕭翁九十歲了。七月廿六日是他的壽晨。蕭伯納不臺歡做生日，廿年前會罰着不再做第二個。那是一九二六年，他寫這：「對於這些讚美我的頌詞，我都能受之無愧。只是這是我的第一次慶祝誔辰，也是準備慶祝的末一次。」因爲這個原因，他的友好們：HG威爾斯，穆雷敎授，曼斯斐爾，潑萊斯里，A赫胥黎與熊式一等，各寫一篇紀念或硏究的文字，合出了一册專集，以示敬愛。</p>
<p>這老兒，其實並不老。雖則他是曾與維多利亞朝文人爲伍，身歴兩次世界大戰的現代文壇上碩果僅村的古董，有幾個人感覺到他的年紀的負擔。人們只覺得他是這一世紀的大文豪，曾經寫了兩部近代的傑作：「聖女貞德」和「人與超人」；却不道他的大部份生命已經化爲歷史了。曾經與他同代的作家羣中，有吉伯林·哈代·王爾德等。而當他第一部劇本（Rhinegold）出版時，坦納生與白朗寗也還在世。</p>
<p>蕭伯納生於愛爾蘭的杜勃林。父親是個頗具幽默感的酒徒；母親是個極有修養的歌唱家。家境淸寒，因此他最初的卅年一直是在窮困中過去的。終其一生，他是個未曾受過多少學校敎育的智者；可是他幾乎讀遍了地球上所有的名著。他愛音榮，因爲他母親是個極有修養的音樂家，使這些孩子們得以從小在貝多芬與享德爾樂曲中長大。</p>
<h3 id="c186">蕭翁（油書） <a href="#c186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>— Clare　Winsten</p>
<p>一八七六，蕭隨着家庭到倫敦。每天試着寫千餘字，苦苦寫了十年，完成了五個小說和幾百篇短文，然而一共只賣得六鎊。那幾年，他一直靠着他母親過活，藉此獲得寫作的餘暇。</p>
<p>從廿六歲起，他成了蔬食主義者——一半爲了人道主義，一半是爲了健康。他鄙視那些肉食者。據說有一次，曾因此而與嗜肉的大雕刻家羅丹互作議嘲。蕭不單是食慾的寡慾主義者，也是性慾的寡慾主義者，他是個淸敎徒。雖然也曾興當時紅女伶愛倫。黛麗鬧過一些書札上的戀愛把戲，她始終是忠誠地熱愛他的那位已於三年前亡故的夫人的。</p>
<p>一八八四，蕭加入了創立才一年的費邊學社，爲社會主義運動奔走街頭熱烈宣傳。三年以後，他又把對象從工人階級轉移到智識份子，他的鋒銳便捷的口才征服了好些人。</p>
<p>蕭翁不單是社會批評家，還是音樂與戲劇批評界的權威。他曾替好友哈立斯編的「週六許論」，寫了三年劇評。這是當時倫敦的一本高級讀物，其時蕭翁在文壇上的地位，也已經因其潑辣機雋的文筆而雄峙確立了。</p>
<p>蕭伯納的幽默詼諧是舉世皆知的，大家把他看作玩仳不恭的丑角。其實，他是個戴着小丑假臉的理想主義者。他自己自視爲時代的先知，是否如此，那就得讓時閒來作最後的判斷了。</p>
<p>但是，他的冷諷熱嘲僅是表面的形式，一時的工具——這却是眞的。他自己也曾說過：「假若不如此說說笑笑，怕沒有一個人會受得住的。」在這一個諷嘲的面具之下，是一顆愛爾蘭人熱血沸騰的赤心，是强烈的人間愛，是廣博的同情。他時時在替那些勞動的貧苦的人們設法改善境遇，也時時自掏腰包救濟他們。正如却斯特登所說：滑稽家往往是世上最嚴肅的人。在大庭廣衆之間，他固然口齒銳利，喜笑嘲屬雜作；私生活中，他却是個沉靜，友善，溫文的謙謙君子。</p>
<p>蕭翁今日已在文學史上奠定了輝皇的地位了，人們常將他與莎士比亞相比擬。（莎翁是他最敬仰的一人呢。）隨着榮譽而來的，當然也財富。劇本替蕭帶來了大宗錢財，若干年來，他是世界上收入長豐的劇作家；最近又成了代價最高的電影劇本寫作家。根據他的劇本編製電影，得從總收入內提出十分之一酬謝他·已攝成的有「賣花女」，「巴白拉上校」等片，最近又攝竣新片「凱撤與埃及女皇」。因此當某次英國方面想以最高褒獎授贈時，他竟乾脆拒絕了；他認爲蕭伯納這名字，再無須加以不必要的點綴。</p>
<p>蕭翁的重要劇本有下述數種：武器與人（初演於一八九四）。Candida（一八九四）。魔鬼的門徒（一八九七）。凱撤與埃及女皇（一八九八）。人與超人（一九〇三）初演於一九〇五年月。巴白拉少校（一九〇五，十一月）。以後他又曾寫了「賣花女」與最後的一個著名戲劇「聖女貞德」（一九二三）。並寫了多種經濟學名著。直到現在據說他還在寫一個劇本。</p>
<h3 id="c187">蕭翁逸事 <a href="#c187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>— 槐</p>
<p>蕭伯納的詼諧是舉世聞名的。有一次一個漂亮的女伶（並不是舞蹈家鄧肯）寫信向他求婚。她說：「你的腦子加上我的身段，我們將產生最完美的孩子。」但是蕭回答：「倘若那孩子承襲了我的身段和你的腦子，怎麽辦呢？」</p>
<p>詼諧是詼諧了，可是大多數學者們，雖則很敬仰蕭的智憲的啓示，却並不怎麼欣賞他的小丑面目。這些人中間也有他自己在內。一晚，「武器與人「演完後，把蕭請出來以作者身份謝幕。在一陳熱烈掌聲的末尾，突然來了一聲冷冷的「噓」·蕭翁伸起雙手讓瘋狂的靈衆靜下來。然後旋轉身來向着倒彩的方向，說：「我很同意你，朋友。但是滿屋子人的意見恰跟我們相反，我和你二人又有什麽辦法呢？」</p>
<p>一九二五年，他曾拒絕諾貝爾文學獎金。他拒絕的理由極有意思：他並不需要這筆錢。這錢大約合美金三萬五千元，他說：「宛如救命圈之於已經安全渡登彼岸的游泳者，毫無用處。」</p>

<p>他的夫人夏綠蒂·唐Charlotte　Paylle　Townshend已於三年前逝世。現在他只是獨個兒住在Ayot，僱有車夫·園丁·管家及女傭各一人。每年七月，他必到倫敦去住些時，讓傭僕們可以有個休息，烟突等等也可掃除一次。</p>

<p>— 英·穆雷教授作　藍甯譯</p>
<p>我病着·可是對我如此敬仰的GBS，我不能給遺漏在一羣紀念者的外面。</p>
<p>讓我重提一句舊時的題辭。在我論亞里士多芬斯一書中，我寫着：「獻給我的老友GBS，一個愛好理想，憎恨殘暴，曾以歡笑充塞世界，而勇氣從不消失的人——」</p>
<p>「愛好理想」，雖然我曾與許多文化工作者相處，我懷疑有幾個像他這樣强烈地度着精神生活，而很少顧到肉體方面的人。他把飲食的享受看得驚人的輕。粗鄙與肉慾是不見於他的洋溢的雋智中的。甚至創痛似乎也不能怎樣騷擾他。有一次，他受傷甚重，遍體包紮，折骨，流了很多血。我去看他，總以爲他是躺在床上，却不道吿訴我正在園裏高岡上。我進去不見一人、只是淸晰地聽得從一叢冬靑樹後傳來陣陣笑聲。循着聲音找到了他。他沒有注意我的到來，沒有注意他自己的創痛，用沒有包紮的手正在書寫，一面快樂地放聲歡笑。</p>
<p>甚至作爲改革者看，使他感到興趣的也是理想。雖則他正視並洞悉世故人事，我想，他的激動，主要的並非是爲了對人類苦難的同情，却更多是爲了造成這些苦難的荒謬，設施。他用嘲笑與冰冷的邏輯改革，勝似訴之於感情。</p>
<p>當然也不能忘了他極端的「憎恨殘暴」，憎恨無論對人的或是對畜牲的殘暴行爲。他似乎是並不屬於我們這嗜一肉種族的。這一種族一生主要樂趣是我們之所謂「運動」，亦即「打獵」，「射獵」和「釣魚」，常以死亡與創痛加之於幾乎每一樣能生活能感覺的生物身」。同樣地，他憎恨人性的壓抑；並非他特別喜歡兎中城狐狸或是窮人。只是他不忍看他們被苛待。</p>
<p>褒到他的「歡笑充塞世界，」這是太易於瞭解了，但有兩點値得注意。第一，我懷疑人類史上是否曾有過像他如此偉大的智者，諷刺家而絕不挾嫌惡意攻　私人的。他會對着他以爲殘忍或不公平的的行爲或設施猛烈抨擊。然而從不涉及私人。像一般次一流的諷刺家，或甚至偉大的前輩伏爾奉與亞里士多芬斯那末地傷害他人，他從來想也沒想到。不過，他與這二人一樣，有着許多諷刺家所缺少的偉大氣資，他對詩，畫，音，樂，的傑作懷着眞正的尊重與欣賞。在同代學者中，若論莎士比亞硏究，很少有幾個比他有更深切的知識的。他總是注意着同代的天才，（不是　羨或嫉妬）；他曾爲托爾斯泰，易卜生，梅特林克，羅丹而欣喜。對於年靑的英國作家，他孜孜不倦地給予帮助。</p>
<p>他的「勇氣從不消失。」我不是單指他無畏地攻擊一切事有特權與權威的固有信念或設施·他抨擊保守主義和過邀言義，迷信和科學，只要他認爲什麼時候那一樣過於擅權攬勢，他便不顧一切地抨擊。他更有一種稀有的氣資：天才的勇氣，或者我竟可名之爲天才的固執。我還記得當他最初的戲劇出版時，每一個人以爲是無法搬上舞臺的。戲院經理們和易地說他很有一點戲劇的天才；只要他能改動他的晦澀的劇本，或是找個才思敏捷然知戲院情形的作家幫他改寫一番，它們也許是頗値得演出的·但是二十年後，他終於堅毅地寫出了一本有人敢於演出的劇本—「武器與人」·立刻得到了成功，以後沒有多久，蕭獲得了現在的地位，成了歐洲最著名讀者最廣戲劇家。</p>
<p>在所有他的驚人才華之外，他是最和藹慷慨的一人·我將不稱他是最聰敏的人·他在實務上的天才不是建設設性的，面是分析的。有次他在「週六評諭」上爲自己的幾個作品辯護，大胆地寫道：「我是什麽人，應該公正不偏？」這是個坦白的辯護。評衡爭執的因素，審愼綜合後指出一條妥善的路，這不是他的職務。官吏和執政者可以幹這些。蕭的職務是指出那些錯誤的然而不被人知的事情；有時甚至不惜出之以誇張或偏激的筆調，這着人們正視那些不能見到或不願見到的事情。</p>

<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>我從來不知道什麽叫作忙，什麼叫作累，可是在我們這通縣臨時行動總部辦公室內，別的不說，只看那人員紛紛退出，報吿，指揮，派遣；又聽那電話的丁伶伶聲，和隔室傳過來，隱隱約約，秘密電機的打打茲打聲，響個不住，那隊長，一手握着耳機，一手接電訊，口發命令，眼睛翻閱報吿；這一切等等，就是坐在那裏不管閒事，僅祗聽聽看看，也要覺得頭暈腦悶，眼花耳鳴了。</p>
<p>那位北平來的頭目，現在已在第十二團中，就任了臨時作戰參謀長，實際就是監視僞自治軍，怕有越軌行動。我一方面在辦公室助理隊畏辦事，一方面還同虎第擔任着發動以後的外勤聯絡工作。這點職責，聽來好像輕鬆平常，可祗要閉目幻想一下，那時城內城外，兵馬奔騰，槍砲震天，子彈亂飛，人聲喧嚷，整個城市，一殺就要變成一鍋翻騰濺瀑的沸水一般，你還得在這個紛亂沸騰之中，往來料理各方進行情形，收發報吿，決斷問題；一個不對，也許還要搯出槍來激鬥一陣。如此想來，我們的職務，並不十分輕鬆哩。</p>
<p>虎弟同我一樣，穿着「保安隊」的制服，所不同一點，他剃的是一個光光的和尙頭，我則仍舊剪的男裝髮。這時候他在辦公室裘閒着無事可做，閉着一隻眼打瞌睡，那睜開的一隻眼睛，大概就爲的要留意瞧着，怕我們出動的時候，把他扔下了。因爲嫁長好幾次逗着他玩，說他年紀太小，幹起工作來，怕鎭壓人不住。背地裏却是誇贊得他無所不能。</p>
<p>事務忙碌的時候，時間過得極快，一晃就到了三點多鐘。隊長看見大家都有些困倦，便喚勤務來，吩咐開了幾瓶酒，拿出些現成的罐頭，和餅乾點心之類，讓大家醒醒困，同時也大家「乾一杯」，來預慶勝利成功。頭一個驚動起來的就是虎弟，那閉着的一隻眼睛，立時睜開了。</p>
<p>還有一件關於虎弟的事，似乎應當插在這裏報吿一下，虎弟自到通縣以來，比以前要沉默得多。從前，大庭廣衆之前，他固然不大多插嘴發言，除非他覺得這句話，非說不可，才肯開口；可是同我單獨在一起的時候，他可也不怎麼緘默，而且很瑣碎，有些像老太婆的勢　叨叨。這兩天却有些變樣，就是同我在一起，也不說話；不問，不答；好像有挺大的心事。</p>
<p>昨天尤其特別，一早起來，就問我要一百塊錢，說是碰見了一個寨子附近裏的人動身回家，他要託那人捐幾個錢給媽。這個數目相當的大，（從前要錢，最多一元爲限，剃頭洗澡，買點零嘴；）這還不去說　，並且當時我就證明他在說假話，因他一說假話，那雙大圓眼睛，至少要連着　閉三四下，這是百試不爽的。我並非不能立時扎穿他這個　泡泡，可是我一時好奇，想看他究竟在搗什麽鬼。</p>
<p>他拿了錢，立刻笑容滿面，東扯西拉，硬　出些話來逗笑；又向我討了兩小時的假，（因爲在公事上，他是我的助手，算我的屬員，出外必得向我請假。）我　索性很爽快答應了他，只囑咐他快去快　，別躭悮了公事。我本來打算暗地吊他的綫，看他究竟上那兒去，無奈磁巧隊畏找我說話，一時不得閒，竟讓虎弟溜了　。他倒是兩小時不到就回來了，我也懶得追問了；因問也無益，知道他早準預備了一套話來對付我；那又何必多此一舉呢？</p>
<p>這兩天這等忙亂，我却無時不留心他的舉動。除了過分沉默之外，他還時時在霎眼睛，好像在思索什麼。就這時候，在辦公室裏，他雖說坐在屋角一隻軟椅上，閉着一隻跟在休息，我想他不一定睡熟，一定是在那裏盤算什麽。</p>

<h3 id="c194">富貴之道 <a href="#c194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>— S·S</p>
<p>人·情·世·故</p>
<p>不知道是否上帝和人類故意開玩笑？抑或是要爲這大千世界平添許多驚險離奇的花樣？所以目有史以來，任何一個地方都是窮人多於富人；單是窮人多倒並不稀奇，妙却妙在也放幾個亦富亦貴的人點綴其問，於是這擾擾　寰，窮人們都有了生活的目標，向上爬的目標；整日爬，年年爬，等到爬不動躺下來爲止。眼見熙來攘往，塵迷中道，爬起跌倒，跌倒再爬，賞心悅目，煞是好看！</p>
<p>窮人們經過幾千年爬下來的意會言傳，漸漸地也有了一點心得和經騐了。他們懂得了事牛功倍的爬法。這樣行之既久，你就可以喘一口氣，伸一伸腰，洗凈泥汚，昻苜做人。你千萬不能在爬的時候想到在人家脚跟前的猥鄙與可憐，你應該記住這樣爬法是祖宗們一代一代辛辛苦苦地遺留下來的敎條，做子孫的必需克紹箕表，發掦光大。</p>
<p>窮人身上都有一股酸氣，這是在爬向富貴人面前去的時候的一個最大障礙；所以你就應該有自知之明，儘管藍袍于裝，要出落得笑靨迎人，談吐要溫存諂媚，而又要不落窠臼；警如你要是知道你所迎拍的主子是個遜淸遺老，地方士紳，那你就應該在捧着水煙袋承同意旨的時候，痛駡科學，惡詆人心，但你却不能過分否定科學和人心，因爲老太爺們是很淸楚這次東洋人確確實實敗在在原子炸彈上面的；假使你的主子是相信祖宗都是從歐羅巴洲或是阿美利加移民過來的人物，那你就應該誇說阿爾卑斯山較之中國西北幾個土堆要如何的壯麗，强調密西瑟比河較之中國東南幾條泥溝要雄偉多多；在你們談話的當兒，倘若主子的令郞令嫒「約翰」「小瑪利亞」拿着配給食盒在吃，這又是一個再妙沒有的機會；你可以從人家外國怎樣對國民營養重視而合理贊嘆不絕起首，再分析這次戰爭中我們所表現出來的無知，貧弱和窮相，而把結論歸根到描繪人家已將剩餘物資投入海裏的豪華塲面上去；你這邊吠影吠聲，聳肩作態，主子們也一定搖頭幌腦，微笑不語，然後當他默思有頃，拍拍你的肩說：「老弟眞是解人！」你要不慌不忙，俯首帖耳，表示得逢伯樂，死而無憾，願常聽驅策，或是結草啣環！</p>
<p>等而下之，你假使碰着一個曾做過漢奸，而現在猶在某處高踞一人之下，數百萬人之上的主子，你切莫吿訴他：某某從前和他同列過廟堂的摯友已被明正典刑的消息：如果你有一個以「國難財」「勝利財」「接收財」暴發起家，因長袖善舞而倖免淸査的主子，你要對他解釋：儻來之財，原是取之無傷廉惠的道理；倘若你再遭逢到一個和你一樣剛爬上來不久的主子，你更應該對他的「爬法」表示心領神悟，五體投地，聲述「我是天生賤相，無法高攀，」恭維他能够扶披後進，實在是長者風度，仁者用心你要不疾不徐地順着他們的脚跟爬，不輕不重地在他們的　處拍，然後：主子們對你會引爲生死之交，同華們把你當做奴胚狗才，下面還有一羣也跟着你屁股後面拍的人節直把你視爲「畢生楷範，」那麽你纔可以算是爬上一級了。</p>
<p>你在既經爬上去以後，雖然距離大富大貴的標準尙遠，但亦不妨稍仆小憩，鬆弛一下你那爬得精疲力盡的神抓；這時候你可以向那些跟在後面循着你的脚跟爬上米的後輩，以及向在「爬的行列」中掙扎川來的朋儕們吹牛一番一；對前者要擺出像煞有介事的尊嚴來向他們講解「爬的哲學」之精與與深微，對後者則應把「胡適之是我的朋友」的邏輯宣掦一頓，尤其要把你的歴任主子介紹出來，說明這都是親戚故舊，鄉椊同年；他們對你的大放厥辭，雖感到氣勢凌人，但亦無可如何，依然要表示我不如也，崇敬備至；這樣你可以一步一步的離開那窮的圈子了。不過你還要留意時機，尋找更富貴的主子一獻往日身手，迎拍如儀，拍好就爬，爬上去再吹，吹得四面八方，翕然景從，結果爬上「名流」寳座，你不妨再忙裏偸閒，喊兩聲「富貴於我如浮雲」的高調，哼幾句「感時惜福」的低調，包管一唱百和，千古留芳！</p>
<p>「爬」的哲學如此，在下不吝公開，大千世界，苦海無邊，窮人太多，回頭是岸，願一起來爬，同登極樂！阿彌陀佛。</p>

<p>上海某敎會大學裏，九百多學生中，十分之九是中國人，十分之一是外籍學生，在十分之九的中國學生裏，却有少數是滿嘴外國話，穿外國衣服，叫外國名字，故等於長得外國人容貌的中國人，這一類學生，他們決不能滿足做中國人的條件，但是他們却自稱是中國人！</p>
<p>中國人雖然不見得都認識中國字，但是無論如何中國人一定要會說中國話，（除非啞吧）尤其是在中國的最高學府裏，竟能發現不認識本國字的學生，眞是够可恥的了，這一羣不能說本國話的中國學生，簡直是不要臉，本來在該學校裏一年級原有「中文」課程，但是他們却和眞外籍學生同樣地免修了，的確，他們和外國人無甚差別；說外國話，長得外國模樣，甚至於有在馬達加斯加，哥多……的出生證，他們生在外國的環境裏，說着外國話，受着外國人的保護，所進的學校也是外國人所管制的，在學校裘受着和中國人不一樣的待遇，若是你偶然地和他談一會，他竟會不帶羞澀地用外國話吿訴你：「我也是中國人』。</p>
<p>他們在學校裏受着優待，因爲學校的主事人是外國人，他們可以不交學費，可以不花錢吃飯。這些不明國籍學生的在校消費完全由中國學生的學費來彌補，這些半洋人興奮時的拳頭，也是由中國學生來接受。他們明明是看不起中國人，但是卻時常用言語表示他是中國人！</p>

<p>職業不論高低大小，祗要經營得法，就會「行行出狀元」。紐約百老滙有兄弟兩人—愛爾·高爾德和司丹東·高爾德—以出售彩繪的烏龜致富，可說是三百六十行之外的「狀元」了。</p>
<p>八年前，高爾德兄弟開始了這個新奇的買賣，經過了幾年的慘澹經營，生意發達，他們己成爲「硬殼產品」的批發商，美國各地的禮物店和一角商店都經營這種新奇的小玩意。除了百老滙的老店，他們又在曼哈丹的市中區增設了好幾家支店。</p>
<p>這種「硬穀產品」是繪着各種彩色的烏龜，有懷錶那樣大小，平均每隻售價美金四毛半。顧客可以選一個名字或幾句話用不能抹掉的墨水刻在龜背上。有的人刻上女朋友的名字有的用做生日或結婚的禮物，有的做廣吿用或陳列用，甚至有人用做求婚。</p>
<p>好萊塢名歌星平克勞斯貝曾替他的四個孩子定了一批「硬殼產品」。秀蘭鄧波兒，迪安娜　萍和其他的好萊塢明星對這種小玩意都很愛好，甚至嚴肅的卓別林也未能「免俗」。英國前首相張伯倫曾郵購過五十隻，分贈給他的孫子。裝烏龜的郵包是一種特製的盒子，開着通氣的洞，裏面墊着潮濕的苔蘚。</p>
<p>買這種爬行緩慢的動物有許多的理由，做父母的常買兩個較大的烏龜帶回家去塗給孩子·一星期後，他們再買一個較小的，當晚上孩子入睡後，便們便把小烏龜的放在它的「雙親」一起。第二天早晨孩子們發現了這個「奇蹟」便高聲歡呼起來，說小烏龜是「仙鶴」帶來的·</p>
<p>有些人相信烏龜能帶來好運道，便爲「好運道」買了一隻，還有一些懶於覆信而覺得過意不去的人，便寄去一隻烏龜，背上題語道：「我覆信和這個傢伙一樣的慢」。</p>
<p>高爾德兄弟的最辛述的顧客，是一個有兩個孩子的父親。他買了三隻烏龜，得了一筆橫財。他將兩個孩子的名字分別刻在兩個烏龜上，另一隻刻上他家的闊朋友娜娜的名字。後來娜娜拜訪他家，看見了她的「同名者」，她被友誼的舉止感動了，就拿出一筆錢來做兩個孩子的敎育基金。</p>
<p>高爾德兄弟在路易西安那州的兩個城鎭設有烏龜養殖塲。每週運抵紐約的烏龜大約有一萬五千隻，都成排的擺在箱子內，裏面塞着苔蘚，其中大部份都是從路易西安那州來的。到達紐約後，烏龜就被放在大桶裏，等候「製造」。第一步，在烏龜的甲彀上塗一層保護的白色。然後這小東西就一打一串的被碼尺挾起來，同時由一個嫺熟的女工用刷子將它們刷擦一番，隨後就把它門放到架于上去晒乾。其次是望上一層厚的琺瑯—紅，黃和藍是三種最流行的顏色。</p>
<p>假如烏龜是大的，它便適於誕辰或婚禮之川。烏龜經選擇後就在它的背上用特種顏料給上適當的圖畫。「完工」了的烏龜就陳列在部份充水的桶水裏—桶裏的水，冬天是喛的，以防冬蟄；夏天是涼的，用以「袪暑」。</p>
<p>高爾德兄弟出售一種特別的烏龜食料，內含乾的螞蟻蛋和乾的蒼蠅，前者來自芬蘭，後者來自墨西哥。</p>
<p>高爾德兄弟還帶賣另外一種新奇的東西，就是：小的美洲短吻　魚。但是，「烏龜大王」抱寃着說：短吻　魚不大容茹馴服，也不易常年獲得，而且又沒有多大吸人的魔力。所以，從生意的立塲面言，高爾德兄弟所喜愛的還是烏龜。</p>

<p>吳氏爲國民黨元老，道德文章，冠冕當代。蔣主席尊之爲「黨國　寶」，馮玉祥會稱他做「白頭少年」，胡適更譽爲」近三百年大思想家之一」。其秉性極孤高，努力克已，生平嘗以不做官，不乘人力車，不用奴僕爲立身的準繩。在重慶時，常常穿着敝舊的布衣服，拿着手杖，在路上若其的來走去。他所住的那座「抗戰房子」，薄薄的瓦片，竹紥的屋架子，將是用竹和砌的，陳設很簡單，屋內僅可容數人。</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Taipei, 22nd] Chairman Chiang, accompanied by his wife and Chief Executive Chen and his wife, proceeded from the headquarters to the Taipei Martyrs' Shrine at 3:15 PM on the 22nd to offer flowers and pay respects to the revolutionary martyrs, the military and civilians who died in the War of Resistance, and the late Prince Yanping Zheng Chenggong of the Ming Dynasty. On the way from Caoshan to Beitou (both in the northern suburbs of the city), the Chairman and his wife stopped their car by the mountainside to view the panorama of Taipei City. After the memorial ceremony at the Martyrs' Shrine, he inspected the area around for five minutes, and then proceeded to Tamsui, arriving at 4:05 PM. After tea and snacks, the Chairman inspected the ruins of the fort and took a photo with Chief Executive Chen. He then ascended the platform and gazed afar towards overseas, lingering for a long time. After the inspection, he and his wife each planted a camphor tree nearby. In the past, Tamsui was an important seaport in northern Formosa. At the end of the Ming Dynasty, the Dutch occupied the island by building Fort Santo Domingo here. In 1661 AD, Zheng Chenggong sent troops to conquer it, landing here. The site of Fort Santo Domingo still exists today and is clearly visible. At 5:05 PM, he inspected Tamsui Middle School, where the students cheered "Long live the Chairman!" The Chairman nodded frequently and said, "Good, good, thank you, thank you." As it was already dusk, he returned to the headquarters to rest. Residents along the way hung flags to celebrate, and men, women, old and young, stood respectfully in front of their homes amidst the myriad lights. Furthermore, very few people knew about Chairman Chiang's arrival in Taiwan beforehand. Yesterday, when the Chairman passed through the city by car, some elderly women were so overjoyed at the sight of him that they shed tears. After learning of this news this morning, citizens and shopkeepers automatically hung flags, and the streets instantly became lively.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Middlemen Mediate for Days, Suggesting a Halt to Propaganda Warfare First <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 22nd] Tonight's tea party at Sun Ke's residence lasted from 8:00 PM until 11:10 PM. All attendees except the CCP representatives were present and seriously studied various issues. After the meeting, Sun met with reporters and said that the Communist Party representatives and third-party figures had been in Nanjing for two days and were still exchanging views. Furthermore, the third party was heard to be negotiating, conveying the opinions of the CCP and the government, and then deciding on a meeting format. Formal negotiations have not yet begun. What can be reported today is that one opinion from the third party has been accepted by the government. This opinion is that the propaganda of both the government and the Communist Party should be taken seriously, and a "propaganda truce" should be implemented immediately. In the future, any documents and statements that must be published must be agreed upon by everyone. This is a new constraint. After the meeting, Liang Shuming and Luo Longji of the China Democratic League, Mo Dehui, a virtuous social figure, and Chen Qitian of the China Youth Party, went to visit Zhou Enlai at Meiyuan New Village, returning to Lanjiazhuang at 12:00 AM and holding a temporary press conference. Liang announced the progress of today's talks, stating that the opinions on the ceasefire discussed by the third party and the representatives of various parties today have also been recorded and transmitted to the government. The gathering at 8:00 PM was initiated by the third party to explain this to the government representatives, which took a long time. Everyone believes that things can still proceed and should not be viewed pessimistically. However, the most important thing at present is that the propaganda of both sides should not be excessive, so as not to affect the progress of negotiations. From the 23rd, the third party will invite both the KMT and CCP to begin negotiating the implementation of a cessation of propaganda offensives. Those who cherish peace must pay attention to this matter. Finally, Liang solemnly stated that the third party declares as follows: "Unofficial negotiations have been actively underway for days, and all reports of disputes and speeches published by each other do not affect the negotiations.

<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 22nd] According to sources: The National Army under Liu Ruming in northern Henan has arrived in the Changtai area of southern Hebei, with a tendency to advance towards Handan. The National Army on the Anyang section of the Pinghan Railway is still stationed on the south bank of the Tanhe River, and Liu Bocheng's base in Handan and Xingtai seems to be empty. Furthermore, the National Army has also arrived in Jiyuan on the border between Henan and Shanxi, and the empty Communist Army base in Taihang is feeling threatened.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Xinxiang, 22nd] The National Army in northern Henan has not shown any signs of crossing the Tanhe River and heading north. Several regiments of the Communist Army concentrated in the southwest of Anyang have launched fierce sabotage offensives along the railway line for days. The National Army launched a large-scale counterattack in separate routes from Anyang and Tangyin on the evening of the 20th. According to the front line, the National Army is pressing towards Liuhegou on one route and Hebi Town on the other, both of which are coal mining areas, and fierce fighting is underway.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 22nd] The National Army advancing south on the northern section of the Pinghan Railway will soon recover the Beihe Store after pressing on. The authorities have ordered that they must join forces with the National Army in Baoding within three days to open the Pingbao section. Currently, only the three stations of Beihe, Gucheng, and Xushui in northern Baoding are in the hands of the Communist Army, while a unit of the National Army that recovered Dingxing has detoured to the vicinity of Xushui. The two routes from the north and south will join forces in Xushui. Xincheng, which has been besieged for a long time, was relieved yesterday after the arrival of reinforcements, who launched a pincer attack with the defenders from inside and outside. The rumor that Laishui has been recovered has not been confirmed. Road repair work has reached Dingxing, and the Communist Army outside Baoding is gradually retreating.

<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 22nd] Baoding's defense force is gradually strengthening, and the dangerous period has passed. According to Fu Juantu, director of the Hebei Telephone Bureau, who flew from Baoding to Beiping yesterday: Although Baoding only has more than 10,000 defending soldiers, public educators and citizens have been organized, and now one-third of the force can defend the city, while two-thirds of the force can launch attacks. In addition to the citizens who have already completed organization and assisted in the city's defense, more than 1,000 provincial government employees and more than 1,000 students have also formed self-defense forces. Due to the joint efforts of the military and civilians, Baoding City has completed three strong defense lines. The first defense line is the moat, which was originally heavily silted. Now, after four days of efforts by civil servants, the moat has been dredged into a ditch two zhang deep. The second defense line in the suburbs is densely covered with bunkers and machine guns. The third defense line is a battlefield zone. It is rumored that even if the Communist Army has 100,000 troops, it would be quite difficult to attack. Since Baoding was besieged, the provincial political center has invisibly shifted to Beiping. All official documents are handled by the Provincial Government's Beiping Office. Currently, the only Hebei provincial leaders in Baoding are Secretary-General Shi Delin and Director Sun Bang.</p>

<h3 id="e22">Suspension of UNRRA Aid to China Partially Lifted; Shipments to Resume After US Labor Dispute Resolved <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 21st] UNRRA Director-General LaGuardia announced today that the suspension of UNRRA relief supplies to China has been partially lifted. LaGuardia stated: "Chinese ports that can handle relief supplies can now request and receive them." LaGuardia's announcement stated: "The speed of distribution of supplies in Chinese ports has greatly improved... The embargo on supplies to China is hereby lifted, and supplies will be shipped out according to the capacity of the various Chinese ports upon request." LaGuardia said that ships would set sail as soon as the current labor dispute is resolved. He also said that the report on the improvement in the speed of supply distribution in Chinese ports was received from Major General Aagerton, Director of UNRRA's China Office. The announcement was only seventy-three words long and did not explain the detailed plan.</p>
<p>[Our City News] A spokesman for CNRRA (Chinese National Relief and Rehabilitation Administration) recently commented on the UNRRA Director-General LaGuardia's announcement of the partial lifting of the suspension of supplies to China, stating that this partial lifting was the result of the CNRRA's continuous efforts to clear supplies over the past few months. Considering the current state of CNRRA's supply distribution, UNRRA must immediately fully resume the transportation of supplies to China; otherwise, it may be difficult to coordinate with the CNRRA's future work. It was also stated that since UNRRA announced the suspension order in July of this year, the amount of supplies distributed by the CNRRA to various regions each month has significantly increased. In July, the CNRRA shipped 45,000 tons of supplies to other ports, which increased to 68,000 tons in August and 96,000 tons in September, with a total of 120,000 tons including supplies distributed in Shanghai. The CNRRA's distribution of supplies has been continuously increasing, while UNRRA's transportation has been slow. Taking the most recent week from October 5th to 11th, the CNRRA distributed and shipped a total of 21,958 tons of supplies in and out of Shanghai, while UNRRA only unloaded 14,683 tons in Shanghai during the same week. Currently, there are 115,000 tons of supplies remaining in Shanghai warehouses, of which 65,000 tons need to be processed and modified in Shanghai, so only 5,000 tons of supplies can be transported to other ports for distribution. Adding the 50,000 tons that UNRRA plans to ship to China in the next two months, the total is only 100,000 tons. During the same period, the CNRRA's transportation volume can reach 240,000 tons. I have consulted experts on UNRRA's resumption of transportation, and they all said that even if UNRRA immediately fully resumed transportation, it would take three months to see the effect.</p>

<h3 id="e23">UK Communist Party MP Raises Questions in the House of Commons Regarding UNRRA's Relief Plan for China <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 21st] Labour MP Williams asked in the House of Commons: "After UNRRA ceases its activities, what will be the plan for relief work in China? Which organization will take over this work? What consideration will be given to UNRRA's experience in China so that past mistakes will not be repeated?" Under-Secretary of State McNeil replied: "UNRRA's plan in China will not be completed on a large scale until the autumn of 1947. In August, the UNRRA conference in Geneva passed a resolution to submit the question of whether various countries still need relief after UNRRA ceases its work to the UN General Assembly for discussion. Therefore, the UN General Assembly should decide how to handle relief work. Before making a decision, it should first examine whether these countries still need external assistance in addition to loans from international banks. This issue is related to the balance of payments of various countries and cannot be accurately estimated in advance, nor is it within the scope of UNRRA's post-war relief. As for UNRRA's experience, it should be provided to any organization undertaking relief work in China. It is said that UNRRA has set up a commissioner to record the activities in China in detail, which will be a very valuable record."</p>
<h3 id="e24">He Fengshan Reports on Overseas Chinese Affairs: Relief Rice Distributed to Compatriots Who Fled the Dutch East Indies; Overseas Chinese Who Illegally Entered the Philippines Properly Sent Back to China <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 22nd] In order to understand the recent situation of our country's protection of overseas Chinese, this reporter specifically visited the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Director He Fengshan of the Information Department of the Ministry received me and answered the questions as follows:</p>
<p>(Question) It was recently reported that more than 2,000 overseas Chinese fled from the war-torn area of the Dutch East Indies near Panibangan to Gedang Island in British Malaya, and Consul Xu Menghong of our consulate in Kuala Lumpur negotiated relief matters. What is the progress of this matter? (Answer) When Consul Xu learned that the aforementioned refugees had arrived at Gedang Island in his jurisdiction, he immediately requested the local government to issue 600 piculs of low-priced rice for relief. Although the supply of rice in Malaya is currently very difficult, with the assistance of the governor of the province, the welfare department has allocated the full amount for emergency relief. Consul Xu is now trying to transport another 50 tons of rice to Bagan Siapiapi in Sumatra to relieve the refugees there, and is contacting overseas Chinese organizations to launch fundraising for disaster relief.</p>
<p>(Question) It is rumored that dozens of overseas Chinese were arrested by the Philippine authorities for illegally entering the country. What are the details and how has our government handled the situation? (Answer) Recently, more than 60 people from southern Fujian took two steamships from Taiwan to northern Luzon Island and illegally entered the country. They were all arrested by the Philippine military police and escorted to Manila. After we received the report, we immediately asked the Philippine authorities to properly send them back to China. After investigation, it was found that these two groups of travelers were deceived. The owners of the two steamships set up offices in Xiamen and Taiwan, advertising for passengers and claiming to guarantee passage to the Philippines, charging 150,000 yuan per person, resulting in the travelers being deceived and suffering spiritual and financial losses, and affecting the long-standing reputation of our overseas Chinese in the Philippines. Our Ministry has now consulted with relevant agencies to severely punish the operators of the steamships.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 21st] Seventeen hundred overseas Chinese repatriated from Java today submitted a petition to Guo Dehua, Special Commissioner of Foreign Affairs for Guangdong and Guangxi, for forwarding to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The content is unknown, but it is believed to be an appeal for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' assistance.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Chengdu, 21st] Women's groups and representatives of women's schools in the provincial capital held a tea party on the 21st to welcome Mrs. Cripps. More than 100 Chinese and foreign women attended, a rare grand gathering in the women's community. Yang Huilan, the chairman, gave a brief opening speech, followed by a welcome speech by Ms. Hu Yiru, who hoped that Mrs. Cripps' visit would further strengthen the connection between women from both countries, promote friendship, and contribute to world peace. Mrs. Cripps introduced Ms. Miller, Secretary of the United Aid to China Fund, who reported on the organization and work of the United Aid to China Fund and hoped to build a China House in London in the future as a center to promote Sino-British friendship and communication between the two cultures.

<h3 id="e27">Academia Sinica Council Meeting Discusses Work Guidelines; Passes "Academician" Title and Stipulates Quotas <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 22nd] The third annual meeting of the second session of the Academia Sinica Council was held in the main hall of the Academia Sinica on the 22nd. Twenty-eight council members including Zhu Jiahua, Wang Shijie, Weng Wenhao, Bing Zhi, Hu Shi, and Fu Sinian attended. Chairman Zhu Jiahua presided over the meeting, discussed general work guidelines and the allocation of funds. Wu Youxun, Hu Shi, and Fu Sinian believed that Academia Sinica had not yet achieved the ideal in terms of concentrating talents. Mao Yisheng said: "Academia Sinica itself is a research institution. On the one hand, it should enrich research work, and on the other hand, it should be responsible for guiding the research work of academic institutions across the country." Hu Shi also suggested merging research institutes with similar natures to reduce units, concentrate manpower, and make it easier to show work performance. After the break, the meeting started, and the work reports of the research institutes were reviewed. In order to save time, Fu Sinian, Wu Youxun, Zhu Jingxi, Hu Xianlin, Mao Yisheng, Li Shuhua, and Zhu Kezhen were elected as members of the committee, with Fu Sinian as the convener. The meeting adjourned at 12:00 noon. The meeting started at 3:00 PM to discuss the "Proposal to stipulate the name, establishment, election, and related matters of Menber acadimia sinica." Regarding the naming of Menber of acadima sinica, the council members expressed various opinions. There were various names such as "Academician", "Yuan Ru", "Yuan Lü", "Yuan Zheng", "Yuan Yuan", and "Member." As a result, the name "Academician" was adopted, because among the twenty-two council members present at the time, thirteen expressed their support for the adoption. Another important proposal was: "Please set up the Academia Sinica Academician and revise the organization and tasks of the Council." It was decided that the quota of academicians should be 80 to 100 in the first phase, and at most 10 people should be elected each year thereafter. In the future, the Council will be formed by electing council members from among the academicians. This resolution has been reviewed by the organizing committee consisting of Hu Shi, Fu Sinian, Li Shuhua, Wu Youxun, Sa Bendong, Bing Zhi, and Chen Heng, and Hu Shi was elected as the convener.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 22nd] The annual meeting of the Academia Sinica Council will hold a group review meeting on the morning of the 23rd. The first group will review the work reports of the various institutes, and the second group will discuss the establishment and election of academicians and related matters. A plenary meeting will be held in the afternoon.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 22nd] After a heated debate this morning, the Guangdong Provincial Assembly passed the provincial government's proposed general budget for provincial revenue and expenditure for the second half of the 35th year of the Republic. The assemblymen attached great importance to the revenue part, which involves collecting old land tax arrears from previous years, believing that this would increase the burden on the people. Therefore, they advocated not collecting it. After Accounting Director Mao explained many times that this was a central government regulation and the local government could not change it, it was passed. However, it was resolved that the Provincial Assembly would still request the central government for exemption in the name of the Provincial Assembly.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 22nd] In order to assist farmers in the recovered areas to quickly resume production, the Four Banks Joint Office formulated the "Implementation Measures for Emergency Relief Agricultural Loans in the Recovered Areas" after the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan and submitted it to the Executive Yuan. The national treasury allocated 4 billion yuan to the Farmers Bank of China for loans, with 1 billion yuan each in the first and second phases and 2 billion yuan in the third phase. Later, due to the particularly serious disaster situation in Hunan Province, a special request was made to the national treasury to allocate another 1 billion yuan to the Farmers Bank of China for loans. As of the end of August of this year, the bank had successively loaned a cumulative amount of more than 1.009 billion yuan in the recovered areas of 13 provinces including Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hunan, and Guangdong. A total of 5,900 social groups borrowed the money, and more than 420,000 farmers borrowed the money, which has been quite effective in providing relief to farmers and restoring agriculture. As for the remaining loan amount, the bank is still continuing to quickly approve and release the loans.</p>
<h3 id="e35">Restoration Work of the Palace Museum Not Yet Completed <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>Ma Heng Speaks in Nanjing</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 22nd] Ma Heng, Director of the National Palace Museum, came to Nanjing to participate in the board meeting of the Palace Museum. The reporter interviewed him and learned that the restoration work of the Palace Museum has not yet been completed. In Beiping, the bronze collection of the German expatriate Yang Ning Shi was received. The oldest items are from the Shang Dynasty, and there are also unearthed items from Anyang, Henan. Before the war, the excavation work in Anyang was the responsibility of the Academia Sinica. When the War of Resistance Against Japan broke out and Anyang fell into enemy hands, the masses excavated themselves. Occasionally, the items they found were brought to Beiping for sale and were all collected by Yang Ning Shi. Therefore, both the quantity and quality are very impressive. Furthermore, Guo Shiwu, a porcelain collector in Beiping, who was also the designer of the Hongxian Kiln during Yuan Shikai's time, left a will when he passed away, wishing to donate his entire collection to the National Government. At that time, the enemy and puppet forces tried every means to seize it, but Guo's descendants preserved it until now, which was not easy. After the restoration, the Palace Museum received it. The museum has opened special rooms to display these bronzes and porcelains, and they will be open to the public on October 10th. When asked about the relics of Luo Zhenyu of the puppet Manchukuo government, Ma said that Luo had sent his entire collection to the puppet Zhang Chun Museum before his death, and the collection of books was stored in Luo's residence in Lushun. When the Soviet army entered the Northeast, they were all lost, which is a great pity.</p>
<h3 id="e36">Military Law Department of the Ministry of National Defense Executes Three Military Criminals; Two are Traitors and One Embezzled Public Property <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 22nd] The Military Law Department of the Ministry of National Defense executed two military traitors, Li Ouyi and Dong Xiutian, and Wang Zhongmin, a military officer who embezzled public property. Li Ouyi was originally the Major General Chief of Staff of the Fifth Guerrilla Area Command in Guangdong. In November of the 28th year of the Republic, he responded to the traitor's call to come to Nanjing and successively served as the Education Director of the Guangzhou Branch of the Puppet Central Military Academy, the Lieutenant General Director of the Office of the Puppet Military Commission, and the Puppet Capital Garrison Commander and Police Chief. Dong Xiutian once served as the company commander of the 735th Regiment of the 45th Brigade of the Army. He was captured by the enemy and puppet forces in Suzhou in October of the 27th year of the Republic and served the enemy, successively serving as the captain, battalion commander, adjutant, and regimental commander of the Engineering Team of the First and Second Pacification Area Command of Puppet Zhejiang. Wang Zhongmin was the Colonel Warehouse Director of the 33rd Warehouse of the former Ministry of Military Administration in Suzhou. Between March and April of this year, he took 109 bags of white sugar (each bag weighing 150 catties) stored in the warehouse and sold them to merchant Wang Mingjie through the introduction of Fu Ziben, a captain adjutant of the Suzhou POW Management Office of the Third War Zone, obtaining more than 6 million yuan, which was divided up and spent. The matter was discovered by the former Ministry of Military Administration, which detained Wang Zhongmin and Fu Ziben for questioning. After interrogation, it was found that the above situation was true. Wang Zhongmin was sentenced to death for embezzling public property, and Fu Ziben was sentenced to seven years of imprisonment and four years of deprivation of political rights for helping others embezzle public property.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 22nd] A group of 39 Japanese war criminals captured in Qingdao, escorted by Wang Mingzhang, Secretary of the Qingdao Garrison Command, and many military police officers of the 11th Regiment, arrived in Nanjing from Qingdao on the Wanhai ship at 3:00 PM on the 22nd. Because the evidence of crimes among this group of war criminals had not yet been fully investigated, the Ministry of National Defense ordered them to be handed over to the Shanghai Military Court for interrogation. Therefore, the group of war criminals was escorted to Shanghai by late train at 11:00 PM on the 22nd. The reporter boarded the ship and saw these 39 demons sharing a cabin, most of them sitting on the floor, dressed in rags. Among them was Lieutenant General Hosokawa Tadayasu, commander of the Shandong Army, who committed many evils in the Qingdao and Jinan areas during our War of Resistance Against Japan. There was also Zhang Zongyuan, a former Lieutenant General of the Puppet Manchukuo Army, who served as the commander of the Japanese "Royal Collaboration Army" and assisted the enemy in abusing people in Shandong. He claimed that he had already become a citizen of our country.

<h3 id="e41">Wishing the United Nations General Assembly a Success <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>The United Nations General Assembly opens in New York today. Political and diplomatic figures from 51 countries around the world are gathering together to begin the arduous task of discussing how to create world peace. The eyes of all mankind are focused on New York, closely watching the development of this international conference. Although most observers still hold pessimistic views about the future of the United Nations General Assembly, the desire of people of all countries for world peace is so urgent today that as long as there is a glimmer of hope, they will feel that there may be a possibility of a sudden breakthrough, and will never express despair. People of all countries still have boundless expectations for the success of the United Nations General Assembly. Therefore, the US Undersecretary of State, Acheson, in his speech welcoming representatives from all countries on the eve of the United Nations General Assembly, said very frankly and bluntly: "The United States has made supporting the United Nations its consistent foreign policy; and will continue to take this policy bravely forward without the slightest discouragement. The United States government firmly believes that the United Nations will be able to make full progress in the long and difficult journey, and achieve world peace." Although this is just diplomatic rhetoric from an American diplomat, it is enough to increase the confidence of representatives from all countries that the United Nations General Assembly will succeed.</p>
<p>Today, the center of gravity of the world's political situation undoubtedly lies entirely in US-Soviet relations. The key to the success or failure of the United Nations General Assembly also lies here. US Secretary of State Byrnes, who had just returned from Paris, declared when reporting to the people of the country on the proceedings of the 21-nation peace conference: "The most worrying aspect of the current situation is that the tense relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union is increasing rather than decreasing, and the United States has reached the end of its concessions to the Soviet Union." However, after Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov arrived in New York, he gave a speech to the American press, saying: "I believe that sincerity and goodwill will surely lead to mutual understanding; therefore, I also believe that the work that the United Nations General Assembly faces will be completed, and any difficulties can be solved easily. The Soviet delegation will be able to contribute to this United Nations General Assembly and the Foreign Ministers' Meeting to be held in early November, so as to complete its work and promote the interests of peace and the welfare of all countries, large and small, in the world." Although this is diplomatic rhetoric, it is enough to make the world's hope for an improvement in US-Soviet relations even stronger. Therefore, on the eve of the opening of the United Nations General Assembly, we saw a peaceful and bright scene in New York, which is really gratifying. We hope that the world situation will be clear from now on, and that the people of the world who yearn for peace will not be disappointed again.</p>
<p>Since we are in this international atmosphere, we should naturally welcome the opening of the United Nations General Assembly with a happy mood, and sincerely wish the United Nations General Assembly a success. However, looking back on the past and looking forward to the future, and making a comprehensive analysis of the current international situation, we still feel that the future of the United Nations General Assembly is not to be overestimated, and it still requires the great wisdom and benevolence of politicians from all countries to work hard to overcome all difficulties and open up a broad road to world peace. Based on what we have seen, we would like to offer a word to politicians and diplomats from all countries.</p>
<p>First, when we recall the international situation of the past year and a half, we only see waves rising one after another, and several basic problems have gone around in a big circle and returned to the original starting point, without any solution being obtained. This is really the most discouraging phenomenon after the war. In Europe, it has been a year and a half since Nazi Germany surrendered unconditionally and the war ended. In the Far East, it has been more than a year since Japan surrendered. During this period, many political and diplomatic figures have devoted their wisdom and ability to working for peace, but true peace has not yet come to the world. In the international arena, there have been meetings of the five foreign ministers, then meetings of the three foreign ministers, then the United Nations General Assembly, then meetings of the four foreign ministers, then meetings of the four foreign ministers, and now there will be meetings of the four foreign ministers after the United Nations General Assembly. The number of international conferences has created an unprecedented record in human history, but what are the results of these international conferences? Let us make a general clearance. The only achievement is the five peace treaties passed by the Paris Peace Conference. Other important issues could not be resolved by the Foreign Ministers' Conference, so they were transferred to the Paris Peace Conference for processing, but the Paris Peace Conference still failed to reach a solution, and now they have been returned to the Foreign Ministers' Conference for discussion. This cruel fact gives us a valuable lesson: that creating peace is not easy, and that it requires the concerted cooperation of all countries to have a hope of success.</p>
<p>Second, when we study the reasons for the slow progress of peace work, we cannot but attribute it to the fact that the great powers cannot meet each other with sincerity, which leads to mutual suspicion and creates a situation of confrontation between two worlds. In fact, the Soviet Union certainly needs peace and does not want to see war again; the United States also needs peace and hates war. Since the goals of both sides are the same, why can't they cooperate in international conferences? This is obviously due to mutual suspicion between the two sides. There is a common saying in China, "Without sincerity, there is nothing." Since the United States and the Soviet Union cannot meet each other with sincerity, no problem can be solved. On the contrary, if both sides can be open and honest, and there is nothing that cannot be discussed, then any difficulty can be easily solved; as the saying goes, "Where sincerity is, even metal and stone can be opened." Foreign Minister Molotov also made this point in his speech in New York, which makes us believe that representatives from all countries, especially the United States and the Soviet Union, will be able to meet each other with sincerity, abandon all differences of opinion, and reach a completely unanimous agreement in this United Nations General Assembly.</p>
<p>Third, because we hope that the United Nations General Assembly can succeed, we cannot but point out the defects of the United Nations organization. In short, it lacks the spirit of democracy in its organization. The post-war world has entered a new era of peace and democracy, and the present can be regarded as a democratic century. The people of all countries in the world not only demand the democratization of domestic politics, but also demand the democratization of international politics. The politics of power has become a historical relic, and it must not be allowed to revive and reappear on the international stage of the democratic century. If we study the United Nations Charter carefully, we can know that the organization of the United Nations General Assembly, which opens today, has very undemocratic aspects. In its theory, all countries in the United Nations, regardless of size or strength, are equal in law. However, in the Security Council, there is a distinction between permanent member states and non-permanent member states. Furthermore, permanent member states have the special privilege of exercising the veto power over resolutions passed by the Security Council. Any resolution that is approved by all countries cannot be established if one powerful country (permanent member) expresses dissent. What an undemocratic system this is! Therefore, if we want to hope that the United Nations General Assembly can succeed and that it can become the only effective tool for maintaining world peace, then the veto power must be abolished. There has long been a movement to this effect in the United States, and it has been advocated to all countries in the world, and all countries have expressed their approval. The only country that has expressed its opposition is the Soviet Union. Before the relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union has improved, the Soviet Union holds a dissenting opinion alone. From the perspective of the Soviet Union, it certainly has its reasons; but when all countries meet each other with sincerity and no longer have any fears, the Soviet Union naturally has no reason to insist on maintaining the fatal wound in the United Nations organization.</p>
<p>In short, the problems discussed at this United Nations General Assembly, in addition to the current international disputes, will also discuss various issues that are beneficial to the welfare of mankind. They have a very close relationship to the future of all mankind. Therefore, for the sake of the interests of all countries and for the sake of the future of the world, this meeting is only allowed to succeed and not allowed to fail. Let us wish the United Nations General Assembly a success here.</p>

<p>[Report from our Hankou Office on the 22nd] A bizarre bleeding incident occurred in the waiting room of the Wuchang Local Court yesterday afternoon. The victim, Yuan Hongsheng, had his throat slit open, and blood gushed out. He immediately fainted. The court has sent someone to send him to the provincial hospital for emergency treatment. He is still in critical condition. According to a post-incident investigation, the victim, Yuan, was being tried in court on suspicion of being a traitor. Later, due to insufficient evidence, he was released on bail. Yesterday afternoon, Yuan invited local Baojia gentry to prove his behavior during the occupation. The court first questioned the Baojia gentry, while Yuan waited alone in the waiting room. There was no one else in the room. When the bailiff returned to summon him, he found Yuan's tragic death. Everyone who heard about it was shocked. A search was conducted in the room, but no murder weapon was left behind, which shows that he was attacked by someone in secret. The court is strictly arresting the murderer.</p>

<p>[Report from our Suzhou Office] The Kunshan County Confucian Temple Restoration Committee believes that the county's Confucian Temple suffered greatly during the Anti-Japanese War and was ravaged by enemy bandits, and the halls and buildings were almost completely destroyed. After the victory, local people proposed reconstruction, but due to the occupation of the area by passing troops, construction could not begin. Recently, the county temporary council sent a letter to the county government, requesting that the competent authorities be ordered to evacuate, and reconstruction should be carried out as soon as possible in order to protect the ancient sites of the saints. Therefore, on the 19th, the first meeting was held in the Minglun Hall of the Fuxue to invite relevant agencies and local elders to discuss the reconstruction plan. The following resolutions were passed: (1) The restoration expenses will be budgeted by the committee, and a letter will be sent to the county government to request that the expenses be drawn from the surplus items in the 35th fiscal year. A letter will also be sent to the Wuxian Post-War Relief Association to request the Jiangsu-Ningbo Branch to provide work relief for the repair, and the construction of the Dacheng Hall and the East Wing will be added to the estimated cost, and the construction department will be requested to re-estimate.

<p>[Report from our Pinghu Office] The merger of townships in this county was previously ordered by the provincial government. The entire county was reorganized into 26 townships based on geography, history, customs, and wealth. After the county government convened a meeting to adjust the matter, the tenth district commissioner's office ordered that it be reduced to 19 townships, resulting in the complete overthrow of the previous resolution. The county government then reconvened a subcommittee meeting to review it. According to the previous administrative divisions, it was divided into urban areas with a total of five townships, Zhapu district with five townships, Xincang district with five townships, and Xindi district with four townships. The principles will soon be submitted to the county council for review, and the entire merger can be completed in mid-November.</p>

<p>[Report from our Suzhou Office on the 22nd] The case of the death sentence for a traitor announced by the High Court on the 22nd involved Shi Guanggen, who served as the pseudo-township head of Bupu Township, Chetai County, during the war. During his tenure, he committed all kinds of crimes such as kidnapping and extortion, and had many blood debts. From April to July of the 32nd year of the Republic, he successively arrested Wang Xiaoqin, the principal of a local elementary school, twice, extorting a total of 53,000 yuan. Fearing retaliation, he killed Wang on the evening of July 3 of the same year. After the victory, Wang's family members and other victims reported the case. The Suzhou High Court concluded that although Shi was only a pseudo-township head, his crime was heinous. In addition to the death sentence to uphold the law, all his property was confiscated.</p>
<p>[Report from our Suzhou Office on the 22nd] Lu Qi, a judge of the First Pacification Zone Military Court, arrived in Suzhou from Yu on the morning of the 22nd and went directly to the Suzhou High Court to meet with President Sun for discussions.

All personnel were avoided during the interrogation, and the case seemed to be quite serious. The interrogation lasted for more than an hour before it was completed. The reporter later learned that Lu's trip was to collect evidence for the massacre case by the enemy military police officer, Haruki Komura.</p>

Later, he was captured by the Japanese invaders and joined the Special Task Force of the Hangzhou Puppet Fourth Provincial Governor's Office, serving as the captain of the first brigade. He was transferred to the Secret Service Team of the Songjiang Military Police Team in the 33rd year of the Republic. After the victory, he hid in Suzhou. Recently, he returned to Guan, hid weapons, and planned to take action again. Someone secretly reported it to the Provincial Security Command, which secretly ordered the county to investigate.

<p>[Report from our Changshu Office] Changyisha originally belonged to the three counties of Yu, Tong, and Cheng. After the provincial government ordered it to be placed under the jurisdiction of Changshu this time, Tongyi has not yet been handed over. It is reported that the suppression work will not be delayed due to this, and will be implemented quickly. Commander Kong of the Jiangyin Fortress and County Chief Pan here concurrently serve as the commander and deputy commander, respectively. All steps have been arranged. Commander Kong arrived in Yu on the 20th, and Chief of Staff Nie Qi and Military Judge Mao Xueqin of the unit came with him.

<p>[Report from our Suzhou Office] At about 4:00 pm on the 20th, the Yangcheng District Suppression Headquarters, according to the subordinate 15th platoon of the 3rd Battalion of the Paratrooper Regiment stationed in Xicang Town, Xiyi County, escorted the bandits Qian Xiaodi and Gao Xiaodi and four seized short guns to Suzhou. The reporter happened to be interviewing at the headquarters at the time, and learned the details, which are recorded as follows: At about 10:00 am on the 14th of this month, a case of bandits holding weapons to rob the Suzhou-Ganlu passenger ship occurred in Dongjingqiao. The 6th platoon of paratroopers stationed in Ganlu learned of the incident and immediately set out to search the next day. They also contacted and coordinated with the 15th platoon stationed in Xicang and surrounded them. As expected, bandit traces were found in Xinnan Township, so they rushed to arrest them. However, the bandit leader Li Zaiyang led his troops Mei Baoquan, Gao Jinbao, Qian Xiaodi, Gao Xiaodi, and others to fire their guns and refuse arrest, and a fierce battle broke out. For a time, bullets flew like beads. After a long contact between the two sides, the bandits ran out of ammunition and fled. They were pursued to Tao Fandian Township. The bandit leader Li Zaiyang was shot several times and fell to the ground. He still struggled to jump into the river to escape, but was drowned. The bandit Mei committed suicide with a gun, while the two bandits Qian and Gao were both captured alive. Four short guns were seized at the same time. It was also found that Yao Guilian, the chief of Xinnan Township, was suspected of harboring bandits, and Bao Yunsheng, a villager, was guilty of providing information to the bandits. They were all arrested and sent to the Suzhou Headquarters for interrogation according to law. The reporter also learned that the bandit leader Li Zaiyang was only in his twenties. During the enemy-puppet era, he once turned against the authorities and worked as a secret agent. After the victory, he hid in Shanghai. It is rumored that the robbery case of the Walter &amp; Morsch Bank on the Bund in Shanghai was related to Li. The Shanghai police department searched for him but failed to find him and issued an arrest warrant.</p>

<p>[Report from our Haining Office] Xieqiao Town in this county is located along the Shanghai-Hangzhou line, and the market is prosperous. On the afternoon of the 19th, Cai, the owner of the Xintong Cloth Shop in the town, hired a boat to go to Haining. Near the Ruyi Bridge, four masked bandits with local accents suddenly ordered the boat to stop. Another person stood on the bridge and illuminated the boat with a flashlight. As the boat approached the shore, they boarded the boat and robbed it. It is estimated that they robbed hundreds of thousands of yuan in cash and several kinds of valuables. After the robbery, they fled west. The police received the report and, because robbery cases often occur in the area, have taken precautions.</p>
<p>The Gambling of Flower Societies is Resurging in the Counties of Taizhou</p>
<p>[Report from our Taizhou Office] The gambling of flower societies has always been prevalent in the counties under the jurisdiction of Taizhou. The Commissioner's Office of the district has previously severely cracked down on it and ordered the county governments and townships to ban it, and the trend has gradually died down. Unexpectedly, recently, gamblers in various counties have resumed setting up flower societies and setting up listening devices everywhere to entice foolish men and women to bet in order to make a profit. They have been found in the villages of Huangyan, Wenling, Linhai, and Xianju. It is hoped that the authorities will strictly prohibit it.</p>
<h3 id="e54">Second Inspection Committee Arrives in Suzhou to Thoroughly Investigate Corruption in the Reception of Automotive Battalion <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>[Our Suzhou Dispatch, 22nd]  Senator and concurrently member of the Beijing-Suzhou Group of the Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Anhui Region Reception and Investigation Team, Wu Cangzhou, recently made a special trip from Beijing to Suzhou and is staying at the Lexiang Hotel.  Our special correspondent in Suzhou visited him on the afternoon of the 22nd to inquire about the mission of this trip.  He said: After returning to Beijing from Suzhou, he received a confidential report alleging that the Second Battalion of the Twenty-fourth Automotive Military Corps stationed in Suzhou had hidden and failed to report enemy and puppet vehicles handed over during the reception process, and instead sold some, loaned out some, and used some for business.  Furthermore, the misappropriation of gasoline by reporting higher quantities than actual was also a blatant and conclusive act of malfeasance.  Therefore, Team Leader Fan Yu dispatched him to Suzhou to thoroughly investigate.  He has already summoned the battalion commander, Jiang Xiaoyi, for questioning, but the latter has avoided meeting him so far. He will conduct the investigation independently, and once the evidence is collected, he will return to Beijing to report and handle the matter according to law.  The reporter inquired about the details and exact amounts involved in this corruption case. Mr. Wu stated that because the investigation is still ongoing, it is difficult to disclose any information at this time.</p>
<p>[Our Xuzhou Dispatch]  Senator Zhao Xuefeng of the Third Group of the Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Anhui Region Reception of Enemy and Puppet Materials Investigation Team stated: The investigation work is now approaching its conclusion, but many cases reported confidentially are being delayed due to excessive involvement. Although the leads in each case are now becoming apparent, they have not yet been thoroughly investigated. In particular, in Bengbu, Anqing, Wuhu, Hefei and other places in Anhui province, there are still several major cases that have not yet come to light. It is necessary to increase work efficiency in order to complete the task as soon as possible. Therefore, it is planned to proceed separately: the central Anhui region will be the responsibility of Ma Jingchang, the southern Anhui region will be the responsibility of Mr. Zhao, and the northern Jiangsu region will be the responsibility of Yang Wenbing. Mr. Ma has already left for central Anhui, and Mr. Zhao will also soon depart for Wuhu.</p>

<p>[Hangzhou Dispatch] The Zhejiang-Fujian Branch of the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA), in cooperation with various charitable organizations, Red Cross societies, and church groups in Hangzhou, has recently established thirteen children's education and nurturing stations, accommodating a total of 1,800 destitute and abandoned children. In addition to providing free meals daily, they are also taught basic knowledge, including hygiene, music, handicrafts, and games. According to Director Xu of the Huilan Education and Nurturing Station, most of these children suffer from ringworm due to poor nutrition, and many also have trachoma. The clinic established by UNRRA within the YMCA is providing free daily treatment. The Huilan Children's Education and Nurturing Station is one of the thirteen stations. The station's premises are borrowed from Huilan Middle School, and UNRRA is responsible for supplying the necessary food, such as rice, vegetables, milk powder, and canned goods. Books, furniture, and fuel are purchased with donations from the China Red Cross Children's Welfare Committee.</p>

<p>Hope for Extension of Route 7 Bus</p>
<p>The Route 7 public bus has already been in operation since Double Ten Day. The residents of Hongkou have indeed gained considerable convenience. However, the starting point is at the Wusong Road intersection of Broadway Mansion, and because there is no connection with trams or public buses, we still feel it is somewhat inadequate. Most of us Hongkou residents hope that the Route 7 public bus can be extended further westward along the Suzhou River from Broadway Mansion to Sichuan Road Bridge. This way, after crossing the bridge, there would be access to Route 17 trolleybuses and Route 2 public buses to reach the central district. The transportation authorities would not suffer much loss, or perhaps passenger numbers would increase due to the bus connection, thereby increasing revenue, but we would certainly gain a lot of convenience. We hope that the authorities will reconsider and grant this request. (Cheng Quanlu)</p>
<p>Fruit Vendors Also Need to Live</p>
<p>I am a civil servant. The other day, while passing through the intersection of Simalu and Jiangxi Road, I saw a fruit vendor selling apples and pears there. Suddenly, a vehicle for catching vendors came and took away about seven-tenths of his fruit. The vendor cried and lay on the sidewalk, wishing he were dead! Many people felt sorry for him at that time! I think that those who do small business also seek profit from their capital. Currently, factories are shutting down everywhere, and there are many unemployed people. Even if they start work, they need an introduction. If even small vendors seeking profit from their capital cannot do business, then what are they supposed to do? They also have wives, children, and elderly at home. Are they supposed to watch them starve to death? Therefore, I hope that the enlightened authorities can allow those who do clean small business to temporarily struggle through these hard times, so that they are not deprived of their livelihood!

<p>Reply to Mr. Fugongping: (1) If a private middle school has been approved and registered by the puppet education administrative authority, the graduates of that school should be regarded as graduates of schools established by the enemy and puppets and should be subject to screening. (2) If the school has not been approved and registered by the puppet education administrative authority, it cannot be regarded as a school established by the enemy and puppets. However, if the school has not been approved and registered by the education administrative authority, its graduates should still be subject to screening. (3) If the school is located in Wuxian County, its graduates should be directly submitted to the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education for screening. (4) Graduates of the school who were admitted to national universities before 1946 should also be subject to screening.</p>
<p>Reply to Mr. Lu Liangcai: Regarding your previous letter appealing for improvements in the electricity supply, we have received a reply from the Pudong Electric Power Co., Ltd., stating: "Since the War of Resistance, our company's power generation equipment has been completely dismantled. Currently, the electricity supply is entirely purchased and transferred from the Shanghai Electric Power Company, which has recently been severely restricting supply due to insufficient capacity. Therefore, the electricity shortage is becoming increasingly serious. Every evening between 5:30 PM and 9:30 PM, the demand for both lighting and power is increasing. Although our company has already announced to all electricity users that they should cease usage during this time to reduce consumption, customers have failed to strictly comply, leading to a sharp increase in load and frequent faults. The brightness of the lights is inconsistent, and our company's preventative measures are insufficient. We sincerely apologize for this. We have now assigned employees to conduct inspections every evening to improve the situation in the future." We hereby reply.</p>

He also said that sufficient preparation beforehand is safer than another Pearl Harbor incident because military weakness is a shortcut to war.</p>

<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 22nd] Mr. May, representative of the United Nations Opium Board, said today that the global anti-drug effort is currently carried out by three bodies: (1) the Advisory Committee on Narcotic Drugs, (2) the Central Opium Board, and (3) the Opium Board's Technical Committee. The latter two organizations will need to be merged in the future. The current work is to determine the amount of opium each country should receive based on statistics and medical needs. If the quantity exceeds the need, the Central Board has the right to request the exporting country to stop transporting to a particular country. Before the war, Japan evaded international control because the Japanese people were encouraged by the government to secretly manufacture heroin and use the drug to traffic into China, undermining the morale of the Chinese people. Germany also had a man-made drug similar to morphine, which was not made from poppy seeds and was difficult to control. The future of international drug control is promising.</p>

<p>[Agence France-Presse, Rome, 21st] On the day of his assumption of office, the new Italian Foreign Minister Nenni telegraphed Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Shijie, emphasizing the friendly relations between the two countries, and believed that the two foreign ministers would work hard for the people of the two countries and world peace and would certainly achieve something.</p>

<p>[United Press, Washington, 21st] The US State Department announced today that the Soviet chief representative of the Allied Control Commission in Bulgaria has refused the US request to convene a special commission meeting to oversee whether the upcoming Bulgarian elections will be conducted fairly. General Biryuzov, acting chairman of the Control Commission, said that the elections to be held on October 27 are a matter for the Bulgarian government, and any action by the Control Commission would be tantamount to interfering in Bulgaria's internal affairs.</p>
<p>Romania Prepares for General Election</p>
<p>[Reuters, Bucharest, 21st] Romanian political parties have begun preparing for the general election scheduled for December 19. This election will be the first since 1937, and women will be given the right to vote for the first time.</p>
<h3 id="e69">British Naval Commander-in-Chief Speech; Attaches Importance to Defending Sea Communications; Innovate Weapons to Adapt to Modern Warfare <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 22nd] British Naval Commander-in-Chief Admiral Cunningham said today at the Trafalgar Day rally that future wars will show that the weapons possessed by warships must have positive reforms. The industrial revolution has made Britain a major manufacturing field for commodities in peacetime and a large arsenal in wartime. However, the continuous production of industry still depends on the constant input of raw materials. If the source of raw materials and food is cut off in a relatively short period, the people of the British Isles will inevitably starve, and industry will inevitably stagnate. Therefore, it is necessary to maintain our sea communication lines. If the communication lines are destroyed, the enemy can defeat Britain without using new weapons such as atomic bombs.</p>

<p>[Our Dispatch] Paris, 22nd Broadcast London News: The British House of Commons began debating foreign policy issues today. Foreign Secretary Bevin is scheduled to attend and deliver a speech, which will include the following four points: (1) relations between Britain and the Soviet Union, (2) the German issue, (3) the Dardanelles Strait issue, and (4) the negotiations on the British-Egyptian treaty. In addition, the Palestine issue will also be involved.</p>
<p>Another dispatch: Foreign Secretary Bevin said in the House of Commons debate on foreign policy that if we want to avoid new disasters, the world should seek new solutions on a broad basis. He said, "If the United States had also participated in leading the handling of European problems after the First World War, the Second World War could have been avoided." Bevin announced that he had notified the French government and agreed to re-link the Saar region to France economically. French francs can be officially circulated in the Saar to replace German marks, and France can establish a customs union with the Saar. The customs agency should be under the management of the Saar, but France believes that it should be managed solely by France and not under the control of the Berlin Control Commission. The exact terms agreed upon by the British side and whether they contain reservations are not yet known.</p>
<p>Bevin concluded: "The work of dismantling Japan's armaments has been completed. We hope to establish a lasting peace with Japan." Furthermore, the British troops stationed in Indonesia will be officially withdrawn by November 30.</p>
<p>Dardanelles Sovereignty Issue</p>
<p>Bevin then mentioned the Soviet Union's request to Turkey to jointly manage the Dardanelles, saying that this request is essentially an infringement on Turkey's territorial sovereignty.</p>

<p>[Reuters, London, 21st] Although Anglo-Egyptian negotiations were held today, neither British Foreign Secretary Bevin nor Egyptian Prime Minister Sidky Pasha attended. The Egyptian attendees were Foreign Minister Hafez Ramadan and Ambassador to Britain Amr Pasha. Sidky Pasha has a cold and has been advised by doctors to stay indoors.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 21st] Egyptian Prime Minister Sidky Pasha came here to revise the Anglo-Egyptian alliance. Today he stated that, so far, his talks with Foreign Secretary Bevin have proceeded smoothly, but government officials say that the negotiations have not come close to resolving the outstanding issues. It is heard that Sidky Pasha reiterated two final positions to Bevin: that British troops must withdraw from Egypt within two years, and that Sudan must be returned to Egyptian rule. Bevin insisted that British troops could not withdraw within three years, and that the future status of Sudan should be decided by the Sudanese people themselves. Therefore, Britain cannot agree to relinquish the current Anglo-Egyptian Condominium. The Sudan issue has always been the biggest obstacle in Anglo-Egyptian negotiations. The Egyptian side anticipates that Sidky Pasha will return to Cairo on the 28th, and his next step may be to submit the Egyptian issue to the United Nations for discussion.</p>
<h3 id="e74">The Situation in Bombay Remains Tense; Gandhi Says the Muslim League Should Have Strong Control Over Bengal; Nehru, Recovered from His Injuries, Returned to New Delhi Yesterday <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>[United Press, New Delhi, 22nd] Nehru, the head of the interim government, was injured by Muslims while inspecting the Northwest Frontier Province. After the riots in Calcutta, the situation in Bombay has become even more tense today, with refugees from East Bengal flocking to Calcutta.</p>
<p>[United Press, New Delhi, 21st] Gandhi said here today that the Muslim League has a large number of members in Bengal Province and should have the power to control the province. I am scheduled to go to Bengal next week to inspect and comfort the victims. Gandhi also said, "If British forces can withdraw, the disturbances will end sooner. If British forces continue to exist for a long time, both India and the Muslim League will hope for British power as assistance. I have to admit this point." Gandhi criticized the statement by the new Muslim League cabinet member, Ali, that the Muslim League's participation in the interim government was only to promote the partition of India, saying that this attitude was strange and contradictory. The establishment of the interim government is to deal with general national problems such as hunger, cold, disease, poor transportation, and illiteracy. These problems do not distinguish between Hindus and Muslims.</p>
<p>[United Press, Peshawar, India, 21st] Nehru and his party of four were inspecting the Northwest Frontier Province by car today when they were surrounded by Muslims near the Malakand Fort. The car windows were smashed by stones, and Nehru was injured on his left ear and left cheek. Jafar, known as the "Frontier Gandhi," was injured in the nose. Two British reporters were also slightly injured. Nehru's minor injuries were quickly treated, and he will return to New Delhi tomorrow to handle cabinet affairs.</p>

At the same time, the new Iranian Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Firouz, also declared that Prime Minister Sultan has prevented any misunderstanding between the Soviet Union and Iran, which is gratifying.

<p>Gandhi Discusses the Secret to Longevity</p>
<p>[United Press, New Delhi, 12th] Mahatma Gandhi, who is already 77 years old, said today that he used to be confident that he could live to 125 years old, but this belief has now been shaken. Recently, friends congratulated him, causing him to eat too much food and lose his previous "tranquility." If one can maintain "tranquility" at all times and be content with oneself, then it is possible to live to 125 years old without illness. Do not be disturbed by anything. Even I myself cannot say that I am completely unaffected by external stimuli.</p>

This large-scale strike is unprecedented in aviation history. According to World Airways, the union is currently demanding that pilots of four-engine aircraft fly 20 hours per week and receive an annual salary of $15,000.</p>

After being interrogated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation for more than a year, it has now been announced that she will not be prosecuted because "Tokyo Rose" is an abstract name, including at least twelve voices, and cannot be held responsible by one person.</p>
<h3 id="e82">Ho Chi Minh Declares That Vietnam Needs Our Assistance; Agreement on Customs and Gold Between Vietnam and France Determined Not to Hinder the Interests of Overseas Chinese <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Haiphong, 21st] A Central News Agency reporter visited Ho Chi Minh, the chairman of the Vietnamese government who had just returned to Vietnam from France, on the morning of the 21st. Amid the cheers of thousands of people outdoors, Ho Chi Minh spoke to the reporter for ten minutes in a calm manner. Ho Chi Minh first said: This trip to France was to establish a temporary agreement with the French government, with the goal of bringing the relationship between the two countries into normality and promoting cooperation. As for the southern issue, it will be resolved separately. The customs union between Vietnam and the French Federation is determined not to limit the economic interests of overseas Chinese. There is a Chinese saying that "everyone eats together." The Vietnamese government views Chinese business in this way. Finally, Ho Chi Minh said: When he was in France, he told a Central News Agency reporter that Vietnam needs China's help. Today, he is willing to repeat his wishes for China to a Central News Agency reporter in his own country, which is that Vietnam needs China's help and will continue to hold this hope in the future because Vietnam has an inseparable relationship with China.</p>
<h3 id="e83">Overview of Important Issues at the United Nations General Assembly <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>[United States Information Service, New York, 21st] The 53 items on the agenda of the United Nations General Assembly are mostly issues of striving for a peaceful world and of lasting interest. First, the United Nations General Assembly decided to hold the meeting in London last winter. This decision means that representatives of 51 countries will face various important issues, such as the establishment of the United Nations Trusteeship Council, the Security Council's veto power, and the issues of various member states, etc. United Nations Secretary-General Lie emphasized the importance of the General Assembly's actions in a special United Nations program yesterday, saying that the General Assembly is "an integral part of the United Nations organization's decision-making," and urged all parties to pay attention, saying that the General Assembly can consider all issues within the scope of the United Nations Charter, in addition to the issues already considered by the Security Council. The timetable for considering various issues stipulates that the General Assembly will hold plenary sessions for four days, after which the committees should begin their work, and then hold plenary sessions again to discuss the progress of the committees' work. The opening ceremony on Wednesday and the subsequent plenary sessions will be held at Meadow Park near New York City; the committee meetings will be held at Lake Success, the temporary location of the United Nations. The General Assembly is expected to close in six and a half weeks (or December 7th). During this period, the General Assembly will hold 450 meetings, of which about 30 to 35 will be plenary sessions, 90 will be meetings of major committees, and the remaining meetings will be meetings of other subcommittees. It is expected that 70 percent of the General Assembly's work will be completed at Lake Success. Plenary sessions and committee meetings are scheduled to be held in the mornings and afternoons from Monday to Friday and on Saturday mornings. There will be no meetings on Sundays. The General Assembly has six major committees, also known as plenary committees, because each committee has representatives from 51 countries. The plenary committees are: Political Security, Economic and Financial, Social and Human and Cultural, Trusteeship, Administrative Budget, and Legal Committee. Each committee also has a 14-member steering committee, composed of the chairman, seven vice-chairmen, and the chairmen of the six major committees. One of the most important issues facing the General Assembly is the trusteeship of dependent territories. It is expected that the United Nations Trusteeship Council will be established. To date, France has submitted two agreements regarding French Togoland and French Cameroon in Africa. Britain, Belgium, Australia, and New Zealand have also reported plans for trusteeship agreements, while the Union of South Africa has proposed a request to merge the mandated territory of Southwest Africa. The United Nations Charter does not stipulate the number of member states on the Trusteeship Council, but the Council must include the countries administering the trust territories (none of the five major powers are included in this group), plus other necessary temporary member states, so that the number of countries administering trust territories is equal to the number of countries not administering trust territories. The General Assembly will also decide on the issue of admitting new member states to the United Nations. If the Security Council's recommendations are followed, the United Nations organization will increase to 54 countries with the addition of Afghanistan, Iceland, and Sweden; but the Security Council has refused to recommend Albania, South Ireland, the Mongolian People's Republic, Portugal, and Austria, etc. The issue of these countries joining the United Nations may be submitted to the General Assembly for discussion. For example, Australia has proposed that the General Assembly should take the first step regarding new member states. One of the early debates at the General Assembly is also expected to be the full report of the Security Council, including the records of the Iran, Greece, Indonesia, Syria and Lebanon, and Franco Spain issues. The General Assembly must also elect non-permanent members of the Security Council for a term of two years to replace the Netherlands, Egypt, and Mexico. Retired member states may not be immediately re-elected. The Economic and Social Council is organized by representatives from 18 countries. This General Assembly should also elect representatives for a term of three years. The retiring representatives are Colombia, Greece, Lebanon, Ukraine, the United States, and Yugoslavia. However, representatives retiring from the Security Council may be re-elected. Several political and security issues also urgently need to be considered by the General Assembly. Australia and Cuba have both raised the issue of the veto power of the five permanent members of the Security Council. Australia has always opposed the veto power and has suggested studying the provisions in the Charter regarding the method of voting in the Security Council. Cuba has proposed two suggestions: one is to convene a General Assembly to abolish the veto power, and the other is to convene a General Assembly to revise the Charter. The General Assembly will also discuss India's appeal and the Soviet Union's proposal that all countries report on the situation of their non-enemy troops stationed abroad. India has filed an appeal, alleging that South Africa is mistreating Indian citizens; the Soviet Union's proposal to report on the situation of stationed troops was rejected by the Security Council. The General Assembly will also consider issues related to the welfare of people's daily lives around the world, including proposals for the reconstruction of destroyed areas in Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and the Far East, and the issue of sending or dealing with displaced persons and refugees. The new International Refugee Organization Charter and its draft budget for the first five years have also been submitted to the United Nations General Assembly. The General Assembly will also receive several reports on the international food situation, including the report of the recent meeting of the Food and Agriculture Organization. The General Assembly will also be invited to approve proposals and take steps to complete the international control of narcotics that was not completed by the former League of Nations. This proposal has rejected the Spanish government's participation in the United Nations narcotics control agency. In addition, the agreements between the United Nations and the following agencies must also be approved by the General Assembly: the International Labor Office, the United Nations Education, Scientific and Cultural Organization, the Food and Agriculture Organization, and the Provisional International Civil Aeronautics Organization. The representatives will also consider steps to accelerate the establishment of the World Health Organization and establish an international children's emergency fund. The start of several welfare activities by the United Nations General Administration will also be discussed. The draft declaration on human rights and freedoms submitted by Panama to the first meeting of the General Assembly last winter was limited by time at that time. Action will be taken on it in the future. Finally, the representatives of the General Assembly will consider the finances of the United Nations, and the budgets for 1946 and 1947. This year's budget will be less than 20 million US dollars; the budget for 1947 will increase slightly. The issue of member states sharing the costs of the United Nations will also be discussed.</p>

The film was produced by the famous American photographer Rayscott during the Anti-Japanese War in our country, showing the battles on the front lines of various war zones, the hard work of the people on the borders of Gansu and Tibet, the arduous project of the Stilwell Road, and the wartime daily life of the President and his wife. It was filmed on location with the latest color cameras, taking more than twenty months, which is by no means comparable to ordinary newsreels.</p>
<h3 id="e94">Goods Tax Bureau Levies New Taxes on Seven Items Including Cement and Flour <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>According to Fang Dongtan, Director of the Shanghai Goods Tax Bureau of the Ministry of Finance: After the bureau was established in Shanghai amidst the destruction caused by the enemy and puppets, a year has passed in the blink of an eye. Although the tax system has been restored to its original state, the preparations and implementation are no different from establishing it from scratch. After repeated reorganizations and improvements, gradual progress has been made, and it is now expected to be brought onto the right track. In total, since the beginning of the year, the amount of tax revenue has been increasing linearly each month. Starting from October, the bureau was ordered to add new taxes on seven items: cement, flour, tea, foil, superstitious paper, beverages, cosmetics, and fur. It should be the bureau's responsibility to increase tax revenue and care for merchants. Although the implementation of various new taxes has not yet reached a full month, the various experiences encountered can be roughly described. For example, tea is currently being promoted for export, so all exported goods are temporarily exempted from taxation to show encouragement. For fur, whether imported from overseas or produced domestically and sold inland, taxes have been paid in accordance with regulations. For goods produced and sold in the city, although merchants have requested a postponement, it has not been approved by the Ministry. The bureau is earnestly urging the Chamber of Commerce to persuade them, and taxes should be levied in accordance with the plan. The other items, such as cement, have also been taxed according to their production and sales situation, either by assigning personnel to be stationed at the factories for collection, or by strictly scrutinizing their transit and circulation to prevent loopholes. The overall goal is to promote the maximum benefit and contribute to the treasury. As for rectifying discipline and encouraging reporting of violations, in addition to publishing public announcements in newspapers, it is hoped that people from all walks of life will supervise it, he said.</p>

<h3 id="e96">Electricity: The Soul of Shanghai! The Foundation of Shanghai's Prosperity Lies in Industry; Industrial Development Depends on Electricity <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>The degree of Shanghai's industrialization can be clearly demonstrated by the figures for electricity consumption. The total power generation of the city is 130,000 kilowatts, of which household use accounts for only one-third, and industrial use accounts for two-thirds. Among the industrial electricity consumption, cotton mills consume 42,000 kilowatts, accounting for half of the total. According to Director Zhao Zenggang's estimate, the work efficiency of cotton mills was higher before the war, and the amount of electricity required to produce each bale of yarn was 200 to 250 kilowatt-hours. Now, the efficiency of cotton mills has not fully recovered, and the production of each bale of yarn requires 300 kilowatt-hours of electricity. In addition to cotton mills, various other industries consume one-third of the city's electricity. According to the statistics of the Public Utilities Bureau, the order of electricity consumption for other industries is: (1) weaving industry, (2) flour industry, (3) paper industry, (4) refrigeration industry, (5) rubber industry, (6) machinery industry, (7) wool industry, (8) tobacco industry, (9) silk mills, (10) oil extraction industry. The Public Utilities Bureau has an electricity supply review mechanism to review the needs of each industry for people's livelihood and determine their priority in electricity supply. At present, the need for cotton cloth production is the most urgent, so the amount of electricity used by the cotton mill industry will have to be increased in the future.</p>
<p>Electricity Plants Are Overburdened</p>
<p>Electricity is the mother of industry. The main reason why Shanghai's industrial productivity cannot be brought to its highest level is the lack of electricity. The current electricity plants in Shanghai are already overburdened, which is a sign of illness. Director Zhao of the Public Utilities Bureau explained this situation concretely at a dinner party of the Factory Rehabilitation Association. He said: The service time of the city's electricity plants is the first in the world; in terms of service coefficient, it is above 80 percent. This means that the machines in the power plants are working for more than 80 hours out of 100 hours! Another fact is "overburden." Because the total power generation is 130,000 kilowatts, and the electricity consumption in Shanghai reaches as high as 150,000 kilowatts at two times of the day and night. Therefore, it is necessary to restrict electricity consumption in the future.</p>
<p>Four Ways to Increase Production</p>
<p>As for the future electricity control policy, the Public Utilities Bureau has put forward two slogans: "Save waste and increase production." The plans to cancel neon lights, restrict advertising lights, and reduce household electricity consumption by 30 percent are all based on the principle of saving waste. As for increasing production, the Public Utilities Bureau also has several directions for efforts. The first way is through the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA). UNRRA has five 2,000-kilowatt generators, and the Bureau hopes that three of them can be used in Shanghai to solve the city's electricity shortage. UNRRA has agreed to leave two, and the Bureau is continuing its efforts. This effort can increase the power by 4,000 to 6,000 kilowatts per month. Secondly, the power generation of the Shanghai Power Company will also increase greatly by next spring. During the enemy and puppet period, the Japanese made efforts to transform it, but the result was damage to the machinery, and the power generation was reduced as a result. After the takeover, the company hired engineers from the United States to thoroughly repair and improve it. It was originally scheduled to be completed in October, but because the repair was thorough, it will not be able to generate electricity until January next year. An important machine was sent to the United States for repair, and it happened to coincide with the major strike in the United States. It was originally scheduled to be completed by the end of the year, but it must be delayed until February next year before it can be shipped back for power generation. These are all unexpected by the authorities, but it is hoped that it will not fail, because from February next year, the city will be able to obtain 37,000 kilowatts of electricity. The third way is in the Pudong District, where there is a British silk factory that had a 2,000-kilowatt power generation facility before the war. During the war, it was dismantled by the Japanese and moved to a certain place, and it is now being moved back. This factory itself only uses 800 kilowatts of electricity, so after the generator is moved back, there will be surplus electricity to supply the industries in the Pudong District. Fourth, in the Zhabei area, the current power generation is 4,800 kilowatts, and after the machine is repaired, it can be increased to 7,000 kilowatts. Because of these four sources of supply, the Director of the Public Utilities Bureau confidently told the factory owners who had returned from the rear that the electricity shortage in the city will improve significantly by next spring.</p>
<p>Warships Help Generate Electricity</p>
<p>One thing can illustrate the Public Utilities Bureau's painstaking efforts on the electricity shortage problem. They are making the greatest efforts and preparing for the worst situation. If the city's electricity shortage reaches a point where there is no solution, the Public Utilities Bureau hopes to borrow electricity from the American warships in the Huangpu River. Their flagship can probably generate more than 4,000 kilowatts, and in addition to its own use, it can have a surplus of 2,000 kilowatts. Of course, this issue is not simple. An American warship supplying electricity to a Chinese city is not something that the commander can decide, and the decision-making power lies with the US Navy Department. In terms of power generation, a large warship is capable of meeting the needs of a city. A naval officer who studied in the United States told me that the power generation of the USS Roosevelt aircraft carrier and the USS Missouri battleship is several times that of Shanghai's electricity consumption.</p>
<p>Electricity Prices Considered for Increase</p>
<p>From the mouth of the Director of the Public Utilities Bureau, it was confirmed the rumors that electricity prices will be increased. He said: The previous electricity price regulations were 50 yuan per degree for small households, 73 yuan per degree for large households, and 84 yuan per degree for industrial use. In fact, this is a losing business. The cost of coal was originally 30,000 yuan per ton, and now it is 80,000 yuan per ton. For cotton mills, the Public Utilities Bureau specifically formulated the "coal-for-electricity" method, which translates to 200 yuan per degree of electricity. The profits from this are used to subsidize the losses of supplying other industries. This is not a sustainable solution. In terms of the raw materials of power plants, coal and diesel are used together. Since the exchange rate adjustment, oil prices have soared, and the cost of electricity has also increased accordingly. The oil used by the Shanghai Power Company is directly shipped from the United States, and the cost is very high. The reason why they have not raised prices immediately is still the result of negotiations by the Public Utilities Bureau. In summary, an increase in electricity prices is necessary; but how much to increase to be reasonable remains to be studied. Objectively speaking, from the perspective of people's welfare, the lower the electricity price, the better; but in today's Shanghai, with electricity prices being too low, there is also a lot of waste among households.</p>
<p>Some industrialists are paying close attention to the coal cost issue. They believe that the reason why Hong Kong's electricity prices are so low today is that local power plants use Annam Hongji coal. They advocate relaxing the standards for coal control and allowing Vietnamese coal to come to China, which will inevitably reduce costs. Another proposal is to explore the potential electricity in the city. For example, the large cotton mills and flour mills now have their own power generation facilities, but because it is cheaper to use public electricity, their own generators are not used. From the perspective of the whole city, this is a considerable loss, especially in today's Shanghai, where one more degree of electricity is equal to one more point of production.</p>
<p>Optimistic About Shanghai's Future</p>
<p>Shanghai is a large industrial and commercial metropolis, and the foundation of Shanghai's prosperity is built on industry. Director Zhao made an optimistic outlook on Shanghai's future. He said that in 25 years, Shanghai will be a world metropolis with 7 million people, not just China's "window." In addition to the existing industrial areas, there should be four new industrial area cities—Zhabei, Nanshi, the city center, and Pudong. A modern port will be built in the Riyuhui Port and Wusongkou area. This beautiful vision of a large industrial metropolis is based on the situation of the Yangtze River Delta; looking even further, it is entrusted to the large-scale Three Gorges hydropower project! Shanghai is the nerve center of China, and "electricity" is the soul of Shanghai!</p>
<h3 id="e97">Women's Circles Hold Tea Party to Welcome Committee Member Fang, Representatives of 21 Groups Participate, Over 100 People Attend <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>The city's women's associations, the women's associations directly under the Education, Vocational, Literary, and Legal departments, women's supplementary schools, women's new life movement promotion associations, and other 21 groups, held a tea party yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM at the Women's Association Grand Auditorium at 580 Nanjing West Road to welcome Director Fang Xiguan of the Municipal Party Headquarters, Secretary Xie Renzhao, Committee Member Lu Yunzhang, and Ms. Fei Xia, a special envoy from the Central Government stationed in Shanghai to supervise the women's movement. On the host side, more than 100 women's representatives attended. At the beginning of the tea party, Chairman Qian Jianqiu delivered a speech, first stating: Today, women from all walks of life in Shanghai are holding a grand welcome for Committee Member Fang and Committee Member Lu in the Women's Association Auditorium. At this very valuable and rare tea party, on behalf of the women of Shanghai, I extend my sincere welcome. Then, she reported on the progress of the Women's Association's work and the various difficulties encountered, hoping to obtain the sympathy and assistance of the gentlemen participating in the tea party. Now that the city's women's movement work is under the leadership of Director Fang of the Municipal Party Headquarters, I believe that any difficulties can be resolved, which is very comforting to the women's compatriots. I am even more fortunate that the Central Government recently sent Supervisor Fei to Shanghai to guide the city's women's movement work. I hope that the city's women will maintain the spirit of past struggles, and under the leadership of these gentlemen, the city's women's movement will definitely achieve great results.</p>
<p>Committee Member Lu's Speech</p>
<p>Hoping for Women's Unity</p>
<p>Then, Committee Member Lu gave a speech, roughly saying: I am very pleased to have the opportunity to meet with Shanghai sisters who have been separated for 18 years. As the national construction work is underway today, I would like to offer four points to all sisters: (1) participate in politics, (2) pay attention to education, (3) increase production, and (4) strive for self-reliance. Finally, I hope that the women of Shanghai will be sincerely united, because only with unity can there be strength, and only with strength can the Shanghai women's movement work be carried out smoothly. Following that, Supervisor Fei gave a speech, roughly outlining the history of the Chinese women's movement over the past 30 years. Upon review, it has achieved great success on the political front, and we should make even greater efforts to strengthen our strength, so that oppressed women can be liberated, and people who are not free can become free. We should strive to engage in production, increase self-education, and improve the education of female workers' children.</p>
<p>Committee Member Fang's Speech</p>
<p>Let the Women's Movement Unleash Its Power</p>
<p>Following that, Committee Member Fang gave a speech, roughly saying: The women's movement is the most important of all social movements. In the future, when the country is successfully built, our women's movement work must unleash its greatest power. I hope that the middle-level female comrades will unite and strive for liberation, and I hope that they will come up with correct ideas to influence their husbands. Only with correct ideas can there be a correct path. Following that, Secretary Xie gave a speech, roughly saying: Respect for women is a characteristic of civilized and progressive countries. China is progressive, and the women's movement should be professionalized and politicized in the future. We must have freedom, democracy, and strive to develop our careers. Finally, Chairman Qian Jianqiu gave a thank-you speech, and the guests and hosts enjoyed themselves until around 5:00 PM before dispersing.</p>

<p>General Tang Enbo, acting Commander-in-Chief of the Army and Garrison Commander of Nanjing and Shanghai, arrived in Shanghai on the 20th, having received instructions from the Chairman to thoroughly investigate the forcible occupation of housing by personnel of the Party, government, and military, and to provide guidance for the city's winter defense conference. It is now learned that Tang's mission has been completed, and he has already left Shanghai by train to return to Nanjing. Tang is reportedly satisfied with the results of this investigation and greatly commends the hard work of the personnel involved. Before his departure, Tang stated that as of now, the Garrison Headquarters has received a total of 1,327 written requests for the eviction of military personnel occupying houses. However, according to the investigation, formal cases of military occupation account for only one-quarter of these, and all have been evicted after execution. The nature and handling methods of these 1,327 cases are as follows: (1) 143 cases belong to enemy property occupied by military and civilians. These houses, because they are enemy property, have been forwarded to the Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau. (2) 145 cases belong to civilian housing occupied by government agencies, Party, and troops, and letters have been sent to the respective agencies and troops to handle them legally, with copies sent to the municipal government and the Ministry of National Defense for record. (3) 205 cases involve occupation by Party and government personnel and civilians. As there is no military status involved, the cases have been referred to the Civil Affairs Bureau of the Municipal Government for handling. (4) 415 cases involve military occupation, and all have been executed with orders to evacuate. (5) 419 cases involve rental disputes, and the parties involved have been instructed to apply directly to the court or the Housing Rental Management Committee for mediation. The above execution work has been ordered to be completed by the 25th of this month. As for the occupation cases still under investigation by the Garrison Headquarters, there are still more than 150 cases, of which more than 130 can be executed immediately, and the entire work is expected to be completed by the end of the month. Furthermore, Tang gave detailed instructions regarding public safety and winter defense in the city, and it is said that he may return to Shanghai again within days after returning to Nanjing this time.</p>

<p>Viktor, a Soviet-籍 Greek Orthodox bishop, was arrested by the Songhu Garrison Headquarters on the 19th on suspicion of espionage. The Soviet Consul in Shanghai, Harin, once went to the Foreign Affairs Office in Shanghai to request bail, but it was not granted because the matter was of great importance.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 21st, he was transferred from the Investigation Department of the Garrison Headquarters to the Military Tribunal of the First Pacification Zone. At 2:00 PM on the 22nd, Prosecutor Lin Wopeng of the High Procuratorate at Tilanqiao opened the court for preliminary hearing. Viktor wore a light blue cloth suit with a black religious robe over it. Ten minutes before the hearing, the Soviet Ambassador to Shanghai, Harin, waited at the High Procuratorate and wanted to talk to Viktor when he walked out of the prison, but he was unsuccessful. The hearing lasted for one and a half hours, and the content was not disclosed. It is reported that the hearing only inquired about Viktor's background and wartime whereabouts, and the hearing will continue today. He is currently detained in Tilanqiao Prison.</p>
<p>It is reported that the reason for Viktor's arrest this time is that he was used by the Japanese invaders during the war to organize a cavalry team to sabotage China's sacred resistance and engage in espionage for the enemy. He once received the Grand Cordon of the Rising Sun from the Japanese Emperor, and there are photos to prove his assumption of a puppet position. These documents were sent to the Military Tribunal by the Garrison Headquarters yesterday morning. If the investigation confirms the evidence, a public prosecution will be filed for war crimes; otherwise, he should be released. As for the rumors that Viktor is being ill-treated in prison, they are absolutely untrue.</p>
<p>The Soviet expatriates in this city are now actively launching a signature rescue campaign. It is reported that hundreds of people have signed up and will launch petitions and marches to our authorities. As for the Soviet Consulate, it is now making representations to our highest authorities, requesting bail.</p>

<h3 id="e113">He Yuxiang Martyred for the Nation; Re-examination of an Old Incident Six Years Ago; Trial of the Case of the White Russian Mercenary of the Former Shanghai Volunteer Corps Shooting and Killing Soldiers of the Isolated Battalion Concluded; Squad Leader Testifies to Witnessing the Shooting; Lawyer Argues that the Killing Cannot be Proven <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>[By Our Correspondent] The court reopened the case of the White Russian mercenary shooting and killing soldiers of the Isolated Battalion at the district court yesterday afternoon at 3 p.m.. Ivanoff (former major and commander of the White Russian unit of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps) and Shi Hongmo, former sergeant squad leader of the Fourth Regiment Isolated Battalion, were brought to testify. After Judge Wu Ronglin, Prosecutor Fang Zheng, and Clerk Xie Yinsheng took their seats, they first asked the defendant, Mitchiakov, how many sentry posts there were next to the Isolated Battalion barracks in September 1940. Mitchiakov answered: There were only seven posts during peacetime, but because the situation was tense at the time, it was increased to thirteen posts. On the day of the incident, Rashidov, from the seventh sentry post, also fired a shot. It is not known who fired the shot that killed He Yuxiang.</p>
<p>White Russian Commander Presents Logbook</p>
<p>The presiding judge then questioned the witness Ivanoff. According to his statement, there were a total of 320 White Russian troops guarding the Isolated Battalion barracks at that time. On September 18, 1940, he was not present at the scene, and he was not in charge of the White Russian unit at that time. After the incident, he only learned from the report that Mitchiakov fired one shot at 12:45 p.m., and 30 seconds later, Rashidov from the seventh sentry post also fired one shot, and the directions were the same. Ivanoff also presented the White Russian unit's "Daily Logbook" to the court as evidence for reference.</p>
<p>A Loud Bang, He Fell to the Ground</p>
<p>Shi Hongmo, the squad leader from the Isolated Battalion, gave a very detailed account of the case, saying: Four days before the incident, an unfortunate event had already occurred. The White Russians used tear gas and water from the water pipes to attack the Isolated Battalion. The Isolated Battalion was unarmed, and five brothers were killed or injured. The names of each person cannot be remembered due to the passage of time. The day of the incident was "September 18th." Early in the morning, people came to the Isolated Battalion barracks to offer condolences, but because the White Russian unit had sealed it off, they could not enter. By 11 o'clock, more and more people had gathered. He (Shi Hongmo referring to himself) was ordered by Regiment Commander Xie to go to the gate to see what was happening, and he stood shoulder to shoulder with the victim He Yuxiang on a long bench, peering out of the wall. The defendant Mitchiakov, who was at the first sentry post, raised his gun and aimed three times. The first two times he did not fire, and the third time he aimed for about a minute. With a loud bang, He Yuxiang fell to the ground. The bullet penetrated He Yuxiang's head and then injured another soldier, Gao Guangyun, in the leg. Because Gao was standing on the wooden washstand behind He Yuxiang, in a very high position, He Yuxiang's death was caused by Mitchiakov's bullet. Although the seventh sentry post also fired a shot, it did not injure anyone. Judge Wu, based on the witness's statement, questioned Mitchiakov again; Mitchiakov denied aiming three times, and said that it was impossible for one shot to injure two people. After the witness made an affirmation, the presiding judge announced the start of the debate. First, the prosecutor stood up and said; The facts of Mitchiakov shooting and killing He Yuxiang have been proven by witnesses, and Mitchiakov has also admitted to firing the shot, so he should be charged with murder.</p>
<p>Lawyer Explains the Circumstances at the Time</p>
<p>Liu Jiangang, the defense lawyer for the defendant, stood up and first explained the circumstances at the time, saying that the Japanese army was showing off its power in the suburbs of Shanghai and repeatedly negotiated with the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Concession to take over the Isolated Battalion. The Municipal Council sent the White Russian unit to guard the Isolated Battalion barracks, which was nominally to guard them, but in reality, it was to protect them secretly. He had asked Frankling, the person in charge of the Shanghai Municipal Council at the time, who told him: On September 14 of that year, because the Isolated Battalion raised the national flag without permission, the British garrison ordered them to lower the flag in three hours. The Isolated Battalion did not comply, and the White Russian unit was ordered to release tear gas and spray water to disperse the Isolated Battalion and lower the national flag, which caused a serious incident and a tense atmosphere. On the day of "September 18th," crowds gathered around the Isolated Battalion barracks, especially around Mitchiakov's first sentry post. Mitchiakov was inevitably panicked under the siege. Six years ago, Mitchiakov was not yet twenty years old, and was in fact an underage child. He had asked Ivanoff why, if the situation was so tense at the time, more sentries were not sent to protect them, but instead an underage child was assigned this important task? Now, although the defendant admits to firing the shot, it cannot be proven that he was the murderer. There are two points to note in this case: (1) The death of He Yuxiang was not thoroughly investigated at the time because Regiment Commander Xie of the Isolated Battalion did not allow the White Russians to enter the barracks. At the same time, Mitchiakov was not the only one who fired the shot. Six years later, it is even more impossible to prove whose bullet killed He Yuxiang. Since the foundation of the crime has not been determined, how can a conviction be made? (2) The act itself: Mitchiakov was surrounded by the crowd on the outside, and the Isolated Battalion responded on the inside, so the situation was very serious. According to the Isolated Battalion barracks guard order, sentries may fire their weapons when threatened or in danger of being disarmed. The defendant, a White Russian, was not well educated and probably did not understand the law very clearly, and this order was issued by the British garrison. The enlistment form of the White Russian unit also stated that they would abide by the rules of the British army, so should the defendant be held legally responsible for firing the shot? He asked the court to decide and requested that the defendant be acquitted or given the lightest possible punishment. At this point, the presiding judge announced the end of the debate and set the sentencing for 2 p.m. on the 28th, and the defendant was remanded in custody.</p>

Yuan expressed dissatisfaction with the verdict and appealed to the Supreme Court, requesting a retrial, and now his wish has been fulfilled.</p>
<h3 id="e117">The Inside Story of Shanghai Pickpocket Gangs (3) <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>— Huang Jiamo</p>
<p>Hats in Hand, Gone Without a Trace</p>
<p>"Catching turtles" means snatching hats, especially expensive Western-style felt hats. The Shanghainese commonly call it "throwing the top palace," which has almost become a well-known term, but those in the profession have given up using it. Brothers who are skilled at snatching hats, especially those who are "hard pickpockets," always work in groups of two or three, lingering at tram and bus stops. They first identify the hats worn by passengers near the windows. As soon as the vehicle starts, they snatch them away along the windows. The owner is unable to get off the vehicle immediately, and the carriages are often packed like sardines. By the time the passenger gets off the vehicle, the pickpocket is already gone without a trace. When rickshaws and pedicabs are speeding along, the felt hats of the passengers on those vehicles are also good targets. The pickpocket only needs to reach out an arm like a monkey and snatch the hat. Then, they run wildly in the opposite direction and hand it over to an accomplice. Even if police officers chase after them, they often lose track of them. This kind of "pickpocket gang" also often "catches turtles" on the railway platforms of the two railway bureaus. In recent years, the railway police have been more vigilant, and these people are rarely seen on the platforms.</p>
<p>The "hard pickpocket gang" groups are all controlled by the "uncle gang." The time and location are all predetermined, and outsiders are not allowed to intrude and "steal their business."</p>
<p>They set the time for action in the early morning, at noon, and at dusk. This is because the early morning is when city residents gather at the stations, and noon and evening are when pedestrians are crowded on the streets, which are all conducive to escaping after the act. The locations they choose are all where there are many side streets or alleys. One of the skilled members of the group carries out the snatching and immediately runs away. At this time, the owner will definitely chase and shout after them. Then, accomplices pretend to be unrelated passersby, stop the owner and pretend to ask questions, in order to delay the owner's time and prevent pursuers who see injustice. With this strategy, they improvise according to the situation, allowing the accomplice who snatched the item to escape from the dangerous situation through the side streets and alleys. These accomplices are called "wind blockers."</p>
<p>Sneaky and Cunning, Many Tricks</p>
<p>"Literary tasks" are the second type of "eating bad rice." Unlike the forceful grabbing of the "hard pickpocket" gangs, they engage in sneaky "petty theft." Because their behavior is more refined, it is called "literary tasks." The categories of their activities and the ways they perform are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) "Flipping over the head" - This gang always uses thick ropes or wooden ladders to climb over other people's walls or roofs, enter the house, and then act.</p>
<p>(2) "Prying open the fan" - They use small iron crowbars to pry open doors and enter to steal.</p>
<p>(3) "Running early cleaning" - Most residential houses open their doors in the early morning to empty chamber pots or sweep. Petty thieves take the opportunity to sneak in and steal whatever they can get their hands on.</p>
<p>(4) "Running to the lamp head" - Also known as "crow head." In the evening dusk, residents often leave their back doors ajar, and petty thieves take the opportunity to sneak in and act.</p>
<p>(5) "Going to the sky table" - Residents often hang clothes to dry on the drying platform every day, or sun them in the courtyard, and they are mostly unattended. Petty thieves use long bamboo poles to take the clothes down. Whether they are wet or dry, they sweep them all away and flee.</p>
<p>(6) "Cutting checks" - If a house has its doors locked, it shows that no one is inside. If petty thieves have previously learned that the family is wealthy, they take advantage of the lack of preparation to break the lock and enter the house and steal at their leisure.</p>
<p>(7) "Running the kiln" - This gang of thieves does not specify a time, and their activities are very free. They steal whatever they can get and leave. No matter when, they take advantage of the opportunity to enter. Moreover, they must have the ability to distinguish. They will not take things that are not valuable. For example, when entering a wealthy family, they pay attention to antiques, paintings, clocks, screens, tripods, and other items in the hall.</p>
<p>(8) "Opening the peach blossom spring" - Digging holes in the wall to steal things, also known as "opening the kiln mouth."</p>
<p>(9) "Going up the bolt" - That is, window-prying thieves.</p>
<p>(10) "Going down the bolt" - That is, door-prying thieves.</p>
<p>(11) "Breaking into the kiln" - Using the excuse of asking for directions, they sneak into people's homes to steal.</p>
<h3 id="e118">"Hardware King" Trial Concluded; Awaiting Sentencing; Zhang Lianfang's Speech of "Grand Principles" Brings Tears to Family Members <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>[By Our Correspondent] Zhang Shufang, known as the "Hardware King" of Shanghai, was arrested after the victory on charges of being a traitor. After the High Procuratorate concluded its investigation, it filed a public prosecution, listing three charges: (1) serving as the chairman of the puppet Shanghai Hardware Industry Association, (2) serving as the director of the joint office of the puppet Hardware, Steel, and Copper Bar Industries, and (3) serving as the chief of the sixth bao of the second lianbao in the puppet Huangpu District, having engaged in activities such as requisitioning iron for the enemy. The High Court held several court sessions to investigate the case, and the debate court concluded yesterday afternoon, with the sentencing scheduled for the 29th of this month.</p>
<p>Zhang testified in court yesterday that he had resigned from the position of chairman of the association more than 20 times, but all were unsuccessful due to the "support and retention" of the industry. This was purely for the "benefit" of the industry and did not harm the country. As for the Pacific War that broke out on December 8, 1941, the Japanese took planned action and sealed up all the warehouses of the four industries of hardware, copper bars, copper-tin, and steel in the city, ordering that the inventory be registered. Under the circumstances at the time, it was impossible to resist, so a joint office was organized to deal with it. The office only had one secretary and one tea boy, and there were no titles such as committee members or directors. It was only a place for daily gatherings of various industries to seek to rescue materials and protect industry and commerce, in order to preserve a little vitality for the country. After the hardware office was established, it did not provide the enemy with hardware, nor did it plunder for the enemy. Because the industries had already registered their inventory with the enemy, they took as much as they wanted. As a result, the enemy navy took 1,200 tons, and the enemy army took 700 tons, totaling about 2,000 tons. This matter did not go through the joint office, but was done individually by each industry. As for serving as the puppet bao chief, he was forced to take on the position because he had a little status in Shanghai. In 1944, the enemy puppets launched a city-wide baojia iron donation campaign. When the bao chief's conference was convened, he did not attend. As a result, the lianbao chief ordered the bao chiefs to forward the order to the jia chiefs, who then forwarded it to each household, and the households sent the iron directly to the puppet police station, without going through the bao chief's office. Under the circumstances at the time, the citizens were also forced to do so. He was purely a businessman and had no intention of being an enemy. At the beginning of the war of resistance, because he was forced to join the puppet organization by No. 76, he once fled to Hong Kong. Later, he returned to Shanghai at the firm invitation of the industry to maintain the association. Later, he secretly transported materials to the mainland and was discovered by the enemy, and he was captured and tortured. At that time, he only hoped for the day when the sun would shine again, but now he has been detained for more than a year on charges of being a traitor. He is truly extremely wronged. If he willingly surrendered to the enemy, he can be severely punished; otherwise, please consider the facts and acquit him. At this point, his family members who were listening in the audience were already weeping. After the trial, the defendant was still escorted back to prison by the bailiffs.</p>

<p>[By Our Correspondent] Li Xibo, the deputy director of the Special High Branch of the puppet Shanghai Taishan Police Sub-bureau, was previously sentenced to three years in prison by the High Court. After appealing to the Supreme Court, it was returned for retrial. Yesterday, the sentence was changed to two years and six months with a concurrent sentence. In addition, Feng Guanfu, who served as a driver and translator at the enemy's Gongda Yarn Factory, was accused of collaborating with the enemy. After the High Court concluded its trial, it was found that he had not committed any crimes, and the defendant was acquitted yesterday.</p>

<p>[By Our Correspondent] Yesterday, newspapers reported that the military authorities' winter defense and security conference resolved that the city's curfew would be reinstated starting on the first of next month. However, according to reporters' interviews with responsible persons at the police station, the news is definitely inaccurate. The Garrison Headquarters has not yet considered this matter.</p>

<h3 id="e126">Forged Lost Receipt <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>Yiming asks if I have a few legal questions and I hope you can give a detailed answer: In the 32nd year of the Republic of China, someone named Jia mortgaged two parts of his land to my late father through Yi as an intermediary. After the fall of my hometown in the 29th year, Yi used his evil influence to buy it from Jia. I was not notified at the time (Jia is now deceased). After the victory, I entrusted someone to negotiate with Yi, and Yi colluded with my stepmother to forge a lost receipt, stating that when Jia previously mortgaged the land to my late father, the loan receipt had been lost and the money had been repaid. This lost receipt is the proof, and the lost receipt is stamped with my late father's seal. Now there are several questions, please provide answers. (1) The original intermediary and the buyer were both arranged by Yi, and I was not notified. Can this be denied? (2) Jia is deceased. Can his property be considered my property and can I apply for land registration? (3) Can I sue in court for forging my late father's lost receipt? (4) Can the public announcement of the invalidity of my late father's seal in the newspaper invalidate the lost receipt at the same time?</p>
<p>[Lawyer Cao Yaxia's Answer] (1) No. Because after the owner of real estate establishes a mortgage right, he can transfer the real estate to others, and there is no provision that the intermediary for establishing the mortgage right cannot be the buyer. (2) No. Because the direct transfer of ownership of the mortgaged property to the mortgagee is not permitted by law. (3) If it is indeed forged, you can sue for the crime of forging documents. (4) Announcing its invalidity in the newspaper cannot invalidate a note that was valid before that announcement.</p>
<p>(2) Returning Mortgaged Land</p>
<p>Ren Chengfu asks if my grandfather mortgaged a piece of land with a living contract in the 3rd year of the Republic of China for 60 silver dollars, and built a house on it. The contract clearly stated that the term was five years, and the land could be redeemed upon the expiry of that term. After five years, he added 35 silver dollars and wrote another contract, stating that the entire amount must be returned at the time of redemption, and nothing should be shortchanged. In the 13th year, he borrowed 10 silver dollars with an interest rate of 3% per month. During the Incident, the house was burned down by the enemy. Until the enemy surrendered, I still wanted to build a house on the land, but the mortgagee intended to redeem it. Although I勉强 build the house now, future disputes are inevitable. In legal terms, can the property be redeemed at his will? Please answer in your column.</p>
<p>[Lawyer Cao Yaxia's Answer] According to Judicial Yuan Interpretation No. 2558, Clause 7, "For pledges established before the implementation of the Regulations for Clearing Real Estate Pledges, if a term has been set, regardless of whether the term has been extended by contract, it may be redeemed within two years after the pledge has been fulfilled for 30 years." The Regulations for Clearing Real Estate Pledges were implemented in the 4th year of the Republic of China, and the pledge in this case was established in the 3rd year of the Republic of China, so it can be handled according to the above interpretation. As for the statutory period for redeeming pledged items, if it cannot be observed due to war, it can still be redeemed within two years after the implementation of the Supplementary Regulations for Handling Civil Litigation after Recovery, as expressly stipulated in Article 7 of the same regulations. Therefore, in legal terms, the pledged item in this case can still be redeemed.</p>

<h3 id="e129">Wool Yarn Evaluation: Cost Standards Investigated by Subcommittee, Divided into Three Grades, Fine Yarn to Be Determined Separately; Future Delivery Limited to Industry Association Members <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Wool Yarn Review Committee established by the Bureau of Social Affairs held its second meeting yesterday afternoon at 10 o'clock. Representatives from the Wool Yarn Industry Association and the Commercial Association, including Chen Qien and Shen Laizhou, as well as representatives from the Bee Factory and Ewo Factory, and others, attended. Representatives from the Municipal Council and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce also attended. Director Gu Bingyuan served as the chairman. First, the Industry Association reported on cost calculations, and the Commercial Association reported on recent market conditions. It was found that the market price of wool yarn has fallen by 20% to 30% in the past ten days. Based on the current market price of raw wool and factory payments, it seems to be falling smoothly, which is cause for celebration. However, since the responsibility lies in reviewing standard prices, continued efforts are still required. It was decided to establish a subcommittee to investigate actual costs, with representatives appointed by the Bureau, the Industry Association, and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, to be used as a basis. The standard market price of wool yarn is proposed to be divided into three grades for evaluation. The first grade is made from 56 counts or higher, such as Bee, 변猫, Hero, Wind, and Earth brands. The second grade is made from counts below 56, such as Golden Dog and Beauty brands. The third grade is made from counts below 48, such as Scholar and Little Girl brands. The cost investigation will target these grades. However, these three grades are all four-ply coarse yarn. The fine yarn will be priced separately, rising and falling accordingly. Regarding the sale of imported raw wool and yarn to the trade, it should be limited to the wool yarn industry. Those engaged in wool yarn in the market should join the Industry Association. The Industry Association representatives strongly advocated these points, and the principles were approved. It was also decided that future deliveries of wool yarn from factories must be limited to members of the Industry Association to avoid disruption by outsiders.</p>
<h3 id="e130">Muslin Transactions Listless; China Merchants Evaluation and Apportionment to Be Replicated; Industry Hopes Joint Allocation Will Continue <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] At 2:30 PM yesterday, Li Shengbo, Deputy Director of the Textile Industry Management Committee, specially convened a discussion meeting at the site of the Sixth District Machinery Textile Industry Association, inviting key directors of the association to discuss reasonable evaluations and the apportionment of national and private yarn mills in the future distribution of cotton yarn. After three hours of discussion, it was said that it was limited to an exchange of views and no concrete decisions were reached.</p>
<p>According to a certain authority in the local dyeing and weaving industry: The current joint allocation of cotton yarn must continue uninterrupted. All factories should seek solutions in a sincere and open manner regarding the joint allocation policy in order to be effective.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market softened slightly, and customer sales remained sluggish. Fabric factories also stopped operations due to the sluggish sales of woven products. At the same time, major yarn mills secretly sold off yarn, which led to price fatigue. However, people's hearts were still stable and would not fall sharply. The market was stable yesterday, and customer groups such as the Hankou and Nanjing groups made some transactions, but the appetite was very small. The opening price of Fangjian was newly adjusted, with Blue Chicken at 77,000 yuan, while Xinyang Crane remained at 77,000 yuan. Very few local firms applied. Dyeing factories purchased some yarn due to active sales, but the amount was not large. If the yarn price can be suppressed, the fabric market still looks soft.</p>
<h3 id="e131">No Regulations on Price or Quantity for Fangjian Buying New Cotton <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>In order to enrich textile raw materials and maintain the increase in national cotton production, the Textile Company has now decided to start buying as much as possible as new cotton enters the market in various places. The company has ordered offices in various places to start buying, but it does not adopt a price limit system, but determines a reasonable price based on the cost in the producing area. The quantity of purchases is also not regulated. The purchasing areas include Shantou, Xi'an, and Nantong. The newly established Zhengzhou office is also a purchasing area. However, in the areas where the company purchases, all private yarn mills can freely purchase and are not restricted.</p>
<h3 id="e132">Cotton Bills of Exchange Can Be Used as Collateral <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 22nd] The method of remitting money for cotton transported from producing areas to cotton-using areas this year was previously approved by the Four Joint Treasury with five-price principles. It is now heard that the Treasury is now formulating three supplementary measures: (1) After September 20, the cotton purchased by various factories from producing areas may be applied for as collateral after arriving at the factory site, in accordance with the original principles, for a maximum period not exceeding 45 days; (2) Cotton originally purchased and stored by various factories may not be applied for as collateral; (3) When applying for collateral, various factories should provide the original bills of exchange or equivalent documents for verification, in order to assist in the production and sales of cotton and prevent the弊病 of promoting hoarding during the transportation and sales of cotton. The above measures have recently been telegraphed by the Four Joint Treasury to various general departments and bureaus for compliance, and telegraphed to various branch offices to notify local departments and bureaus to handle the matter.</p>

<p>[Reuters London, 21st] The demand for diamonds is very strong in some countries, especially in China and India, because of domestic instability. The purchase of diamonds is still the easiest way to maintain value. Although the price of gemstones is cheaper, it does not affect the market price of rough diamonds. The demand from all parties far exceeds the possible supply. For the needs of the United States and the world as a whole, demand exceeds supply by at least three to one.</p>

<p>Government bonds broke the 2,000 yuan mark yesterday, but because foreign firms were willing to hold them, the situation was still hovering. The National C opened at 2,070 yuan yesterday morning, once falling to 1,990 yuan. Before long, foreign firms came in with more than one million yuan, and finally struggled around 2,050 yuan, similar to the previous close. Jia and Yi bonds fell 30 yuan each, and National E bonds rose slightly by 20 yuan. The transaction volume was about 6 million yuan face value.</p>
<h3 id="e135">Amid Controls: Yarn Factories Hope For Flower Allocation, Uninterrupted Electricity, and No Rigid Price Limits <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>Mayor Wu, Chairman of the Textile Control Committee, decided the day before yesterday to temporarily allocate 10,529 bales of yarn. The prices and dates will be determined separately. According to the opinions of the yarn factories, it is difficult to achieve fairness and rationality when materials are scarce. The yarn factories, although seemingly prosperous on the outside, are actually just empty shells. For example, the current price limit is 1.55 million yuan per piece. The cost of three loads of cotton is about 1 million yuan, plus electricity, interest, and various expenses, which exceeds the price limit. There was a period when it was slightly better than other industries, but the current situation is extremely difficult. For example, in terms of electricity, not to mention whether there is enough electricity. In terms of electricity prices, one kilowatt-hour of electricity was originally 84 yuan, but since coal was exchanged for electricity, each ton of coal costs 120,000 yuan. In effect, each kilowatt-hour of electricity has risen to 200 yuan. In terms of productivity, in the past, there were two shifts of 12 hours each day. Now there is one shift of 10 hours, with 20 hours a day. In the past, there were six work days in a week. Now there are seven work days, and sometimes there are rotating power outages. Even if the factories want to increase production, they are limited by various facts. Currently, what the yarn factories hope to solve is: (1) Implement flower allocation, the government should try its best to supply cotton raw materials to reduce costs; (2) Supply electricity, the current methods of rotating power outages and sudden power cuts affect the increase in production; (3) Implement evaluation, not rigid price limits.</p>

<p>[Reuters New York, 21st] The New York cotton market opened actively, with large fluctuations. At one point, sales were heavy and a limit-down was declared. Later, due to purchases by the industry, prices rose again after falling. Fluctuations were seen throughout the afternoon. The total transaction volume for the day exceeded 600,000 bales. According to the New York Cotton Exchange, as of the end of September, the total amount of various types of cotton stored in the United States was 13,667,000 bales, of which one million bales held by the government have been designated for various projects.</p>

<h3 id="e145">Banks Should Pay Even If Draft Stub Is Not Received <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>It is a common practice in Chinese banks that when a remitter remits money from a bank in place A to place B, they hold a demand draft issued by the bank in place A and send it to the payee: when the payee withdraws money from a bank in place B, the bank in place B will usually compare the draft with its stub or counterfoil and only allow payment if they match. If it is a clean draft, the stub will not be compared. However, the Law of Negotiable Instruments does not stipulate that payment should only be made after the stub has been verified, and it stipulates that the holder of the draft should present the draft for payment on or within two days after the due date. If it is more than three days overdue, the payer can legally seek recourse from the bank. The legal provisions are not fully consistent with the customs. The Central Bank recently received an order from the Ministry of Finance via the Four Joint Treasury, instructing that banks should fulfill their payment obligations within the statutory period to maintain credit and facilitate customers. Moreover, the Law of Negotiable Instruments stipulates that payment may be postponed for three days with the consent of the payer, leaving room for maneuver. In addition to verifying the stub, there are other ways to identify the authenticity of the draft. Therefore, it will be much more convenient for payees to withdraw money from banks in the future.</p>

<p>Recently, because the order in the Jiaozuo mining area for white coal has improved, the stored coal blocks have gradually been shipped to Shanghai, so the market price has gradually stabilized and has fallen below the 1 million mark. Foreign coal, Tongdeli, and Xiaozimei coal have also been shipped in small amounts, so the market for white coal blocks has gradually become looser. Because there are no shipments of Yangquan coal blocks, although the asking price has not changed, the transactions are very scarce, only for the use of public office users to purchase winter stove coal. The market for bituminous coal and charcoal is calm, and the trend for firewood remains firm, especially tree firewood is the most popular.</p>

The factory products are gradually being dismissed, and political transactions are exceptionally quiet. Only more than a dozen bales were transacted in the market yesterday. Silk goods are hovering in a tired state. Artificial silk goods, because the cost of raw materials has been reduced, the selling price has gradually decreased. Although genuine silk goods are advertised at the original level, there are very few transactions.</p>

According to the person in charge of the Government Material Property Committee, which is an agent of the Bureau, the committee will start handling the application procedures for the required amount of artificial silk for the silk weaving industry next month, so that it can be allocated from the first week of November.

<p>In addition, the Bureau has issued registration cards to the dyeing and weaving industries that need artificial silk to fill in. As for the ribbon industry, because the three application forms reported do not match, they have been ordered to fill in accurate figures again. Once the procedures are completed, they can be allocated.</p>

<p>[This newspaper's Nanjing, 22nd dispatch] The Ministry of Education invited Professor Ryan from the United States to give a lecture at 3:00 PM yesterday (the 21st) in the auditorium of the Ministry of Education. Approximately 400 people attended, including Ministry of Education personnel, teachers from Nanjing middle schools, and normal school students. The lecture title was "Trends in Modern Education." Professor Ryan's lecture was translated by Ms. Xiong Zhi, and recorded by Mr. Ye, an official of the Ministry of Education. The main points of the lecture are summarized as follows: (1) All aspects of education must be considered. (2) Children should receive a complete education, breaking down the class system. Teaching should be tailored to individual aptitudes, adapting to the development of personality and talent by grouping students accordingly. There should be flexibility in the curriculum, not only in elementary schools but also in middle schools. (3) Teaching should be based on environmental circumstances. If only textbooks are used, talking about flowers and birds in the desert, or rivers and seas in the mountains, it is merely empty talk on paper, difficult to achieve practical results. (4) The true meaning of education emphasizes the entirety of life. In addition to knowledge, attention should be paid to the development of emotions. For example, a nurse should not only rely on medicine for treatment but also provide gentle care to patients, comforting them to speed up their recovery. (5) To achieve the goals of new education, it is not just about teaching materials; teachers must have a new perspective, understanding the various relationships between people and between people and society, as the object of teaching. Otherwise, they can only teach books and not educate people. Professor Ryan also stated that this trend of new education is not only in the United States, but also in all countries around the world. Recently, educational professionals from sixteen countries in the United States participated in the establishment of the Federation for Children's Education, issuing a declaration with key points including opening the doors between schools and society to strengthen communication and connections, changing the system of schools overly trusting in grades and dead textbooks, viewing schools as places for training cooperation and equality, and at the same time seeking to ensure the stability of the lives of those engaged in education and encouraging outstanding young people to serve in education and work hard.</p>

<h3 id="e165">Youlian Women's Volleyball Team Secures Final Spot in Guozhen Cup: Yesterday's Semifinal Sees 3-1 Elimination of Wuben; Men's Match Sees Yuegang Suffer Defeat to Soviet Union <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>[This newspaper's dispatch] The Guozhen Cup volleyball league featured two semifinals last night, both fiercely contested matches with significant implications for the championship, resulting in intense competition and spectacular plays. In the women's division, Youlian defeated Wuben 3-1 to secure a spot in the final, while in the men's division, Yuegang lost to the Soviet Union 2-3.</p>
<p>Youlian Wins After Hard Battle</p>
<p>Since Wang Wuli transferred from Wuben to Youlian, the latter's strength has increased dramatically, seemingly guaranteeing them the championship. However, Youlian's performance yesterday appeared rusty, with a lack of coordination in various positions. According to Chen Meizhen of Youlian, the team members are limited in their practice due to work and academic commitments, which is undoubtedly a factor. Despite being in a weakened state, Wuben fought hard, posing a significant threat to Youlian. Youlian's victory came with great effort. Now that Youlian has defeated Wuben, they will face Youdui in the final for the championship. Based on yesterday's performance, they still need to put in a lot of effort.</p>
<p>In the women's match between Youlian and Wuben, Youlian's Lu Zhaoshan served first, and Li Bo missed, giving Youlian a point. The Wuben players were cautious, and the score remained close. At the end of the first set, Youlian took the lead with a score of 21-19. In the second set, Youlian once led 7-1, but Wuben chased back and surpassed them 9-8. Youlian attempted to recover, but Lu Cuifang's slow movements revealed a weakness that Wuben exploited, resulting in a 21-14 victory for Wuben, tying the score. In the third set, the competition between the two sides became even more heated, with the score fluctuating back and forth, creating a tense atmosphere. After several ties, Youlian relied on Chen Meizhen's successful spikes to win the set 21-19, giving Youlian the lead again. In the fourth set, Wuben led 11-5, but Youlian chased back to 14-11 and eventually took the lead. In the end, Youlian won with their final effort, defeating Wuben 21-18, resulting in a 3-1 victory for Youlian, eliminating Wuben.</p>
<p>Yuegang Suffers Bitter Elimination</p>
<p>The Soviet Union team was determined to win the championship. Having lost the league, they were even more ambitious for this Guozhen Cup. Yuegang was also determined, but unfortunately, their key player Zheng Yiquan was unable to attend due to illness, resulting in a significant loss. Yuegang's defeat yesterday was primarily due to their weak spikes, while the Soviet Union team used both spikes and blocks, and had more stamina. After the score became 2-2, Yuegang was unable to sustain their performance in the final set.</p>
<p>In the men's semifinal, Yuegang and the Soviet Union took the stage. Yuegang approached the match cautiously, and the score remained tight. At the change of sides, Yuegang led 11-10. In the next phase, the two sides engaged in close combat, and Yuegang eventually won the first set 21-16. In the second set, the Soviet Union team worked hard to recover, accumulating points and tying the score with a 21-12 victory. The competition became even more intense in the third set, with the score fluctuating back and forth. Yuegang narrowed the deficit to 17, creating a dangerous situation. They made a desperate counterattack, tying the score at 20, but ultimately lost the set 21-23. In the fourth set, Yuegang suddenly found their rhythm, taking a 11-6 lead. In the end, Yuegang recovered lost ground with a 21-16 victory, tying the score at 2-2. In the final set, both sides were cautious, making the match even more intense. At 11-8, the Soviet Union became even more ferocious, and Yuegang ultimately suffered a crushing defeat 13-21, resulting in a 3-2 victory for the Soviet Union, eliminating Yuegang.</p>

<p>The Zheng Lun basketball team's tour in Shanghai is coming to an end. After playing Huasheng today, they were originally scheduled to tour Beijing and Wuxi.

<p>The Tianjin Huasheng basketball team's third match in Shanghai was originally scheduled to be against the Shantou team today. However, because the Luoyang Zheng Lun basketball team is about to leave Shanghai, the Basketball Committee decided to play against Zheng Lun first. On Huasheng's suggestion, Zheng Lun and the Basketball Committee agreed to change it to a charity match. Tickets are priced at 3,000 yuan for the upper level and 5,000 yuan for the lower level. The ticket revenue will be discussed by the executive directors of the Sports Association to determine the distribution method. Military police are admitted with tickets. During the break, charity balls will be auctioned to increase revenue. The time is 7:00 PM. Huasheng is purely a typical northern school, with a qualified and experienced team. Sha Zhenglong has rushed from Tianjin and is now able to play. Wang Jinliang has also recovered from his illness, which has greatly enhanced the team's strength. A good performance is expected. Zheng Lun has played six matches in Shanghai, with a mixed record of wins and losses. The team's strength is improving, and the entire team has plenty of stamina. Today's match with Huasheng will be a clash of skills, and it is unknown who will emerge victorious. The lineups for both sides are listed below:</p>
<p>(Zheng Lun) Wu Zuoming (Leader), Zhang Yiwen, Luo Houtang (Staff), Wei Lingxiao (Captain), Cai Zhongqiang, Tu Wenlong, Liu Zhengjun, Qian Ruizhang, Zhang Gensheng, Wang Binghuan.</p>

<h3 id="e176">The Thunderous Devastation of Zhangjiakou: A Gourd That Miraculously Escaped Total Destruction—More Like Lamenting Than Visiting! <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>— Eighteenth Dispatch from Beiping  Our Correspondent Song Shaobo</p>
<p>On the eighteenth, I, as a reporter, accompanied the "Chinese and Foreign Correspondents' Zhangjiakou Visiting Group" from Beiping to Zhangjiakou. It felt more like "lamenting" than "visiting." It is said that the chief officer, in his speech during the Suiyuan Commemoration Week earlier this month, solemnly stated, "Although we won the battle, there is only deep sorrow and no joy, because those who died were all Chinese!" Zhangjiakou has experienced this disaster, and the destruction was entirely the work of our own people and their hard-earned property.</p>
<p>At half past eight in the morning, people boarded the plane. For the convenience of the photographers, the plane circled over Beiping twice before flying northwest. Because it was uphill, it took a few more minutes to circle over Zhangjiakou for an hour. From the plane, Zhangjiakou, surrounded by mountains, looked like a gourd, not a place suitable for defense. Regardless of Zhangbei to its north, Chaigoubu to its west, or Xuanhua to the east and west, once the attacking forces controlled these areas, the defending troops in this "gourd" had to consider withdrawing as early as possible. Zhangjiakou's "gourd" seems to have escaped total destruction due to its terrain.</p>
<p>Zhangjiakou has two airfields. The larger one in Yulinbu has been thoroughly destroyed by the communist army. From the plane, we saw that the concrete runway was riddled with bomb craters. We landed at the smaller Yaoguantun Airfield. We boarded trucks prepared in advance by the Twelfth War Zone to enter the city and saw Zhangjiakou after the calamity along the way.</p>
<p>Citizens Awakening from a Nightmare</p>
<p>As the trucks drove through the streets, we saw rows of welcoming crowds that stretched as far as the eye could see on both sides. The reporters seemed excited, but those sitting on the ground did not stand up, and we didn't hear any cheers. Upon closer inspection, the triangular flags read "Welcoming Chief Chen Who Has Contributed Greatly Through Hard Work." The reporters understood. Those people were all listless and expressionless, showing neither joy nor sorrow, as if they were waking up from a nightmare and hadn't fully recovered. Most of the shops and households had national flags hanging on their doors, but the colors and wrinkles didn't look like they were freshly made. Later, when we asked a merchant, he said that they didn't usually hang them in the past. Many people were also standing at the entrances of the shops, seemingly watching the spectacle without any direction. Except for those clearing the broken tiles and dilapidated walls who had work to do and rows of stalls waiting for soldiers with legal tender to patronize, few people were seen working. Although the small shops were open, they presented a desolate scene. The citizens didn't have legal tender to buy things, and the "border currency" had lost its validity. The slogans had been renewed, and the bulletin boards were posted with "Zhangjiakou Garrison Headquarters Announcements." Every announcement was surrounded by a crowd of people. The plaques of "Liberation Grand Hotel," "Xinhua Bookstore," and "Jin-Cha-Ji..." were still hanging, but some had been scorched by fire. In front of the Qingfeng Grand Theater, a sign read "Performing Today," and the brothels "×× Academy" and "×× Pavilion" were still open as usual. Here, one could no longer see any traces of the "Mongolian Occupation" period. Instead, we replaced it with our own destruction and slaughter.</p>
<p>The Station Was the Most Severely Damaged</p>
<p>The most severely damaged was the station. A long row of buildings was completely burned. The carriages were charred, and the train cars collided head-on. The undamaged machines were pieced together to form a locomotive, which was scheduled to be used today to open traffic between Xuanhua and Zhangjiakou. The power plant was completely destroyed. Electric wires were dragged across the streets, but a small generator had been repaired. The chief officer's office has been restored with electricity since the seventeenth. The automatic telephone exchange was completely burned down. It is said that the restoration of this item is the most difficult. The important parts of the radio station have been taken away, and a small radio station can be restored recently. The most fortunate thing is the water supply, which was saved by the workers of the factory. The fuse leading to the landmine was secretly removed.</p>
<p>Following the entry of the troops, a "Provisional Administrative Committee of the Twelfth War Zone" has been established in Zhangjiakou to handle post-disaster administration. The chairman of the committee is Zhou Jun, deputy director of the political department of the Twelfth War Zone. The urgent tasks of this committee include the following: issues of land ownership, marriage issues, confessions of Communist Party workers, currency consolidation, and emergency relief.</p>
<p>Restoring Land Ownership</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of land ownership, the chief officer has received instructions from the central government. In principle, as long as the owner provides evidence (if the evidence is lost, it can be testified by neighbors), their ownership can be restored regardless of the "struggle" they have gone through. However, in order to consider the losses of the cultivators, the right of use and the right of harvest of the cultivators are also recognized, and the land rent is not allowed to exceed 15% of the total harvest. If it has undergone more than two "struggles," the original cultivator should get 35%, the intermediate cultivator should get 35%, the harvester should get 25%, and the landlord should still get 15%. This is a temporary solution, maintained until the end of this year, and then the "land limitation policy" will be implemented according to the land law. The planned project is about 20 mu per person, and the maximum is not allowed to exceed 200 mu for a family of five. The land rent will be less than the 25% rent reduction method. Based on the actual situation, the standard will be roughly the same as the current transitional method, that is, the land rent should not exceed 15% or 10%. According to Zhou Jun, chairman of the Provisional Administrative Committee, this method of limiting land rent has been implemented in Sui East and Sui West. Sui West is 10%, Sui East is 15%, and about one-third of the areas in the province have implemented it, and there is not much difficulty. However, the difficulty in implementing the land limitation method in Chahar Province in the future is whether the central and local governments can raise enough funds to buy the landlords' land and distribute it to the landless. According to his speculation, the local government can raise 10% or 20%. Therefore, it cannot be determined whether this policy can be effectively implemented next year. However, according to Zhou, in order to practice the Principle of People's Livelihood and resist the Communist Party's set of methods, this is necessary and imminent.</p>
<p>Currency Issues Are Troublesome</p>
<p>The currency issue is also a more troublesome issue at the moment. The "Border Region Currency" issued by the Communist Party has been banned from circulation. What is currently available is the 40 million legal tender that the Twelfth War Zone brought with the army. The lack of small denomination currency also needs to be resolved immediately. Therefore, the Chief Officer's Office has lent 20 million to the Chamber of Commerce and allowed it to issue temporary small denomination circulating notes, which began to be used on the eighteenth. Zhangjiakou's prices have not yet been stimulated. Flour is 400 yuan per catty, rice is 500 yuan, and white cloth is 90,000 yuan per bolt. However, people are afraid of the shocking increase in prices when transportation is restored and there is no shortage of currency, because Zhangjiakou actually has very little left. Someone from the Central Bank arrived in Zhangjiakou on the same plane as the reporters to prepare for the establishment of a branch. Marriage issues are easier to resolve. The principle that has been established is that those without problems are free to do as they please, and those with problems are based on the opinions of the women.</p>
<p>Registering Workers</p>
<p>The unemployed workers in Zhangjiakou have not yet been counted. Including the workers of the Longyan Coal Mine in Xuanhua, there are no less than tens of thousands of people. There are many others who urgently need relief due to the war. For the workers, the Provisional Administrative Committee decided to register them starting today, in order to organize them to repair the damaged factories, and give them 1,000 to 1,500 yuan per day, which is equivalent to using work as relief. In addition, the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) also had five people arrive in Zhangjiakou on the same plane as the reporters, bringing 40 million in cash to handle emergency relief.</p>
<p>The Self-Confession Movement is Very Effective. More than 2,500 people have already confessed. The authorities announced that as long as they confess and obtain the guarantee of the Baojia, they will be given a path to self-renewal and will not be held accountable for the past. At the same time, retaliatory actions are prohibited. It has been a week since Zhangjiakou was recovered, and no retaliatory actions have been seen. The general public seems to be very enlightened, which the authorities think is very good.</p>
<p>Panic in Education</p>
<p>Zhangjiakou originally had more than 40 elementary schools with 10,000 students. After this change, they have not suffered too much damage and have all resumed classes. The Chinese Communist Party textbooks have been abolished, but new textbooks have not yet been found, which is a problem that needs to be solved urgently. Secondary schools and above previously included municipal middle schools for boys and girls, agricultural vocational schools, commercial vocational schools, railway colleges, medical colleges, industrial colleges, and Hui Muslim middle schools. The Inner Mongolia Military and Political College had 2,000 students. In addition, there was the North China United University (a merger of Yan'an University, Lu Xun Academy of Arts, Foreign Languages ​​College, and Education College), but the number of students is unknown. When the Communist army withdrew, the students from these secondary schools and above all voluntarily or were forced to withdraw with the army. According to Secretary Wang of the Twelfth War Zone Command, about 6,000 students withdrew with the Communist army, 800 of whom were shot on the road in the name of ideological problems. Some of them have now returned one after another. The Communist Party's Jin-Cha-Ji Daily was published the day before the withdrawal. Before leaving, they destroyed one of the three large rotary printing machines left by the Japanese in North China and turned it into scrap iron. The Struggle Daily in Guihua published the Zhangjiakou version three days ago.</p>
<p>Generals' Humble Attitude</p>
<p>In Zhangjiakou, we met General Fu Zuoyi and General Dong Qiwu, who were both wearing grass-green military uniforms identical to those of the soldiers. They did not take victory as glory and were very humble in their attitude. Chief Officer Fu hoped that the reporters would contact anyone at will in order to know the true situation of Zhangjiakou before and after. Mr. Wang Mingde, the secretary-general of Chief Officer Fu, accompanied the reporters for half a day. He said that the spirit of the officers and soldiers of the Twelfth War Zone is "Although the treatment is different, the life must be the same." Small kitchens are not allowed, and officers and soldiers are completely the same in clothing, food, housing, transportation, and operations. The reporters did not see any difference either.</p>

<h3 id="e178">The Melancholy of Guangxi Women <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>— Guilin Dispatch on the Eleventh  Our Correspondent Liang Xiaozhong</p>
<p>The most mysterious "recruiting son-in-law" situation among the girls in the Zuojiang River area. For the sake of life, many women often fancy some lone guests from other places, and then bring him into their home as a son-in-law, and devote themselves to him (naturally, these women have already accumulated a lot of money from their labor). Occasionally, if the husband misses his hometown very much and wants to return home for a while, this produces the story of "letting the husband go." The wife will try her best to provide the husband with unlimited extravagance and "return in glory," but strictly instruct him on the deadline for his return. If he returns to his wife's home on time, naturally nothing will happen. If he returns past the deadline, nineteen out of ten times, his belly will swell and he will pass away. These fragrant and terrifying legends still circulate in Guangxi today, becoming excellent materials for unofficial history.</p>
<p>The Yao girls in the remote southern country grow up in the Garden of Eden of songs and dances and love. Singing is their spring. Their sweet dreams, the secluded forests and streams in the thousands of valleys and mountains, the fragrant river banks that can be seen for thousands of miles on the plains, are full of different languages and bright songs, which are so gentle, pure, and lovely. Women in the vast mountain villages in southeastern Guangxi always passionately worship a singing goddess, longing for the myth of her singing voice. It is said that the name of the singing immortal is Liu Sanjie, who is from Longshan Township, Guixian County, on the banks of the Yu River (her name is as deeply imprinted in the hearts of the people of Guixian as the eternally shining national hero Prince Yi Shi Dakai, and is regarded as the supreme glory). This beautiful girl from a farming family was born to love singing mountain songs. No matter when she was herding cattle, transplanting rice seedlings, weeding fields, cutting thatch... her charming voice could be heard echoing in the silent sky. A song on the river bridge, a few warbling sounds, intoxicated the strong young men, teased the young men of youth, and brought down the smile of the earth... However, an ugly fate brought her the bullying, torment, and jealousy of a sister-in-law, who was determined to kill this innocent little sister. So, one day, under the pretext of chopping firewood, she took Sanjie to a very steep mountain peak, and then pushed her forward, fully expecting to end Sanjie's life and singing. Who knew that just as Sanjie was falling in the air, she grabbed a ten-year-old vine, swaying in the middle of the deep valley, facing the rushing stream. Sanjie's singing rang out again: "Sister-in-law wants to harm Liu Sanjie, thank you for a thousand-year-old vine." As soon as the song was over, a stone gate on the cliff opened with a "ya" sound. Liu Sanjie took the singing and walked into the cave door, becoming a singing immortal. The story is light and interesting. Liu Sanjie's soul lives forever in the hearts of the sisters. Many people are singing "If you don't believe it, just look at Liu Sanjie, singing should pass nine mountains." Singing not only passes nine mountains, but singing is also the matchmaker for the girls in the mountain countries of free marriage. When the wax is exhausted and the spring surrounds, when the plums are cold and the peaches are beautiful, occasionally a mountain village has an unprecedented program (such as the Spring Festival in the agricultural factory, the Pangu Festival in the Yao area of ​​western Guangxi, the Egg Throwing Festival in the Wanggang area... the men and women of the entire village are completely immersed in crazy songs and dances. The bright moon shines on people, the flowing water plays music, and a gust of mountain wind blows across the plain. The wonderful love reverberates in the deep pine forest. The woman sings: "The stars in the sky disappear and reappear, a Milky Way is desolate and clear. Who can count the stars in the sky, I will spread my wings and fly to the sky." The man answers: "The stars in the sky shine every night, it's not that the brother can't count them clearly, I'm most afraid of counting all the stars in the sky, the sister-in-law won't cross the Milky Way." One song after another, Venus and Cupid's love arrows gently insert into their hearts. When the moon sets, the crows cry, and the dawn urges people, many couples have already walked hand in hand into the girl's father's house, explained it clearly, and then followed a series of betrothal gifts (the Yao people in southwestern Guangxi want a certain number of cattle and white rice, while the Yao area in the Dateng Mountains likes to want hundreds of pieces of snow-white silver dollars. Speaking of the Yao area in the Dateng Mountains, there is still a "prince consort" of the Jinxiu Yao King, who was a popular figure in the former provincial government, but the reason why this prince consort was able to "marry the princess" was not from singing but from appeasement). So, thanks to the legacy of the singing immortal, another pair of lovers became a family. This is the spring of the Yao country, and also a page of poetry in the mountains.</p>
<p>However, the ending of the tragicomedy is often that women suffer the most painful sacrifices. The war and famine of the past two years have devastated the body of Guangxi. More than six million women have endured double the suffering. Grass roots and tree bark have blocked their innocent singing voices. Hunger and poverty are threatening the survival of their husbands and children. Many pure souls have sold their cheap bodies. Many bright pearls on the guide have helplessly become other people's concubines. Infinite sorrow teaches them to shed endless tears like Lin Daiyu, and empty stomachs teach them to live a more tragic life than Zhao Wuniang. What kind of happiness has the sky given to the women of Guangxi?</p>

<h3 id="e179">Visiting Mr. You Yongchang, Chairman of the China Zhonghe Party <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>— Guangzhou Dispatch on the Twelfth Our Special Correspondent Liang Feng</p>
<p>The name "China Zhonghe Party" seems to have been rarely seen in the past. I believe many people feel a little unfamiliar with this party. So, when the news of the arrival of the leader of the Zhonghe Party in Guangzhou was revealed in the newspapers here, the citizens speculated and gossiped in the streets: It's probably another new political party that has been established. Even the reporter had the same feeling. So, on a clear autumn afternoon, the reporter, with a curious mood, went to Room 715 of the New Asia Hotel to visit Mr. You Yongchang, the chairman of the party.</p>
<p>Mr. You is now 61 years old. His face is thin, with high cheekbones and sunken cheeks, and his eyes are sunken and his nose is prominent. The white hair on his head and the silver beard hanging from his lips match very harmoniously. When he receives reporters, he always has a kind smile, giving people a feeling of talking to a kind elder.</p>
<p>The Shen, Xian, and You surnames were originally one family.</p>
<p>Mr. You's surname was originally the "尢" character without the dot on top, so many people read it differently. Some people read it as the You character, and some people read it as the Wang character sound. The reporter first asked about this, and he explained the origin of the surname, saying that their ancestor was originally Shen, and later, after a rebellion, the Manchus were scattered, and they were divided into the Shen, Xian, and You surnames. In fact, they are all one family. Their ancestral home was originally Wuxi, Jiangsu, and later the You surname settled in Shunde County, Guangdong. As for this 尢 character, it should be read with the same sound as 注, but everyone calls me Mr. You, so I have to be surnamed "尤." He only explained his surname, and he spoke for several minutes without fear of trouble. From this, it can also be seen that he is a talkative person.</p>
<p>The Zhonghe Party has a history of 60 years</p>
<p>Turning to the main topic, Mr. You gave the following summary to the reporter's inquiries about the history and current situation of the Zhonghe Party:</p>
<p>"The Zhonghe Party was founded by my father, You Lie, in the Guangxu period of the Qing Dynasty, and was established on March 19th of the Dingchou year, with a history of 60 years. At that time, it was a political party organized separately with the same doctrine as the late Dr. Sun Yat-sen after the Revive China Society. Mr. Sun and Mr. You were born in the same year, launched uprisings at the same time, and fled to Tokyo and North and South America to persuade people to revolt. At that time, the Qing court called the four major bandits of the revolution Dr. Sun Yat-sen, my father, and Mr. Chen Shaobai and Mr. Yang Heling. For decades, the Zhonghe Party was led by my father, You Lie. After my father passed away, comrades at home and abroad elected me to succeed him. There are currently about 3 million party members, most of whom are overseas workers in the Nanyang Islands. However, there are also many in the country. The provinces north of the Yangtze River account for about 300,000. Although the number of party members in Guangzhou has not been accurately investigated, it is believed that it is always more than 10,000, because most of the Zhonghe Party members are "hereditary," so it will only increase and not decrease. At the beginning of the Anti-Japanese War, I traveled from Hong Kong to Qujiang, Guilin, and other places to mobilize party members to participate in the Anti-Japanese War. There was a time when I lost contact with party members in various places due to the interruption of transportation. Now I am planning to reinvestigate and revitalize the party affairs. At present, the Central Executive Department is located in Kowloon, Hong Kong, and will soon be moved to Shanghai."</p>
<p>The Historic National Seal Will Be Presented to the Government</p>
<p>Mr. You spoke eloquently, and the more he spoke, the more excited he seemed to become, with a very proud look on his face. Then, he said:</p>
<p>"My purpose of this trip is to inspect the Zhonghe Party's affairs in Guangzhou. Soon, I will go to Beijing with the National Assembly representatives of the Zhonghe Party to present the 'Long Live the Republic of China' National Seal to the National Government during the National Assembly. This seal was engraved in the 28th year of Guangxu when Dr. Sun Yat-sen and my father decided on the national name 'Republic of China' in Tokyo. The seal is made of ivory, about one square inch in size, engraved with six seal characters 'Long Live the Republic of China,' and has two lions on top, which are very exquisite. On New Year's Day in 1901, the Zhonghe Party began to use it at the first congress held in Tokyo. Later, it was also used at Chairman Chiang's 51st birthday. Other than that, it is rarely used."</p>
<p>The Delay in Presenting the National Seal is in Accordance with Family Instructions</p>
<p>After he finished this paragraph, the reporter had some doubts. Since this is called the National Seal, why didn't it be presented to the National Government earlier? His answer was this:</p>
<p>"My father had long planned to present this seal to Dr. Sun Yat-sen. Dr. Sun Yat-sen said that this is a national treasure and instructed my father to hand it over only when the National Revolution is completed and the National Assembly is convened. In the 25th year of the Republic of China, the Central Government summoned my father to Beijing to discuss national affairs, and my father planned to present it to the National Assembly at that time to show solemnity. However, due to the serious national crisis, the National Assembly was suspended, and my father unfortunately passed away in the capital. While dying, he instructed me to present it when the National Assembly opens, so it has been preserved until now!"</p>
<p>Finally, he said: "My father was a founding father and his revolutionary achievements are outstanding. He was selfless and indifferent to fame and wealth throughout his life. He was very friendly with Mr. Zou Haibin, Mr. Ju Juesheng, and Mr. Dai Jitao during his lifetime. Since his death, he has been buried in Beijing at public expense. Friends also founded the You Lie Memorial Middle School in Hong Kong, and Chairman Chiang inscribed the name of the school. Currently, Guangdong comrades also have plans to establish a branch school here, and I also feel that cultivating talents during the period of national construction is the urgent task at hand!"</p>
<p>When he seemed to say this with emotion, the reporter still wanted to ask questions, but Mr. You already had other social engagements, so the reporter had to leave.</p>
<p>Ten Suggestions on the Current Situation</p>
<p>Finally, the reporter would like to report one thing here. The Zhonghe Party sent a letter of opinion to President Chiang on the current situation on September 9th of this year. Although the content has not been published, the party will publicly announce ten propositions on the current political views, the content of which is that the country and the nation are supreme, reconstruction comes first, internal wars should be stopped immediately, and sincerity and harmony should be directed towards the national cause.</p>

<h3 id="e180">The Danube River Has Many Troubles: The US-Soviet Struggle for Navigation Rights is Related to European Peace <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>The United States has recently been advocating in two international conferences for an issue that is critical to European peace: the unrestricted use of the 1,750-mile-long Danube River for international trade. At the Paris Peace Conference, a vague proposal to convene a special conference on the internationalization of the Danube River was passed over Soviet opposition and the withdrawal of various special proposals by the United States. At the same time, at Lake Success, the United Nations Economic and Social Council passed a similar US proposal. However, countries under Soviet control have threatened to refuse to participate in any international conference that opposes their independent management of the Danube River.</p>
<p>Therefore, this issue inevitably arises again, making it difficult for the United Nations to deal with. The following is a dispatch from Vienna by Howard, the Berlin correspondent of the American "Newsweek," detailing the various important factors behind this complex issue.</p>
<p>Viennese have a satirical remark based on Strauss's waltz, called "The Americans Occupy the Vienna Woods, the Soviets Occupy the Blue Danube." The reason is: American officials and their families live in the luxurious houses in the "Vienna Woods" in the American occupation zone of Vienna, while the section of the Danube River and its tributaries from Enns in Upper Austria to the Black Sea are under Soviet control.</p>
<h3 id="e181">American Control of One-Fifth <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>— Translated by Zuo Xi</p>
<p>In reality, the United States controls one-fifth of the entire length of the Danube River. This includes a narrow stretch of the upper Danube, from Ulm in the state of Württemberg to Linz within the American occupation zone in Austria. From there, it extends along the southern bank to Enns, where the Soviets have placed underwater cables. Within this section of the river above Linz, the Americans possess one-third of the Danube fleet. This fleet comprises 971 vessels from Austria, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, Hungary, France, Bulgaria, Romania, and other nations. These ships had been used to transport retreating German nationals and supplies in the last months of the war, or had fled upstream after the war to avoid capture by Soviet forces. Among them are 34 passenger ships, 105 tugboats, 55 motor barges, and tankers. The remaining are miscellaneous vessels like ordinary barges, oil barges, and crane ships.</p>
<p>American engineers have cleared the river channel from Linz to Regensburg within Germany and have established three Danube shipping companies to manage navigation on a 296-mile stretch of the river within the American occupation zone. These three companies are the Bavarian Danube Shipping Company (DDSG), the Bavarian Lloyd Shipping Company, and the Comos Shipping Company, owned by Bavaria and chartered by the Netherlands. Of the 971 vessels, 390 belong to the Danube Shipping Company. All ships and equipment belonging to this company within the Soviet occupation zone were confiscated last winter by the Soviets as "German assets" according to the Potsdam Agreement. Consequently, the company has requested that the Americans refrain from allowing the ships to sail until the issue of sovereignty over the Danube Shipping Company is resolved. The company demands that the Soviet side return the dock equipment and 220 vessels confiscated by them. Although the Austrian Parliament has nationalized the company, and it has now become an asset of the Austrian government, the Soviets continue to occupy and operate these ships and equipment under the name of the Danube Shipping Company.</p>
<p>Blue Disappears</p>
<p>There is a Viennese saying that the Danube is always blue in the eyes of a lover. But in reality, this putty-colored river, snaking around Vienna like a dead snake, shows no trace of blue. Seen from the sky, it resembles flypaper, covered with dilapidated docks and warehouses, scattered with collapsed bridges, and the protruding hulls of sunken ships. Viennese people like to gather on the riverbanks, resting and reading under the trees, and even hardy men swim in this river. However, the section from Linz to below Vienna is entirely foul-smelling stagnant water, with no ships sailing on it. The port of Vienna, with its ten miles of docks and wharves, used to handle 1.7 million tons of shipping annually before the war, but now it is silted up and dead.</p>
<p>According to the Soviets, the throat of the Danube is the bridge in Tulln, about fifteen miles from Vienna, which was destroyed by Hitler's guards. All five sections of the bridge are broken and sunk in the river. Retrieving the Tulln bridge from the riverbed requires operating in dangerous rapids and requires specially trained engineers, workers, and underwater equipment, all of which the Soviets lack. Austrian engineers estimate that in normal conditions, with the proper tools and labor, the entire bridge could be retrieved in thirty to forty days. However, the Soviets, using only one crane and a small number of Austrian workers, have only retrieved one section of the bridge in nine months.</p>
<p>Stagnant State</p>
<p>In the second week of July this year, the Soviet Danube Shipping Headquarters in Budapest sent a circular to all shipping companies under Soviet control, announcing that the Danube River from Vienna to the Black Sea was now open. Companies only needed to give twenty-four hours' notice to confirm the weather and river conditions to freely utilize that section of the river. The only shipping company that has accepted this Soviet proposal is the Czech Shipping Company, to transport 2,000 tons of wood pulp from Bulgaria to Bratislava in the Czech Republic.</p>
<p>Below Bratislava, the extent of navigation hazards, tariff regulations, border inspections, various levies, loading and unloading fees, and other practicalities are unclear, and there are various restrictions. Even the extent of Soviet control remains unknown.</p>
<p>There is no regular commercial transport on the Danube. Only about 300 ships operate within Bulgaria, Romania, and Yugoslavia, and about 30 to 50 operate within Hungary. However, due to the danger of mines and obstacles, transport is limited to one-way transactions and involves great risks. British and American officials are well aware that the Soviets currently control the northern estuary leading to the Black Sea, but they admit that they know nothing about the situation in the other two estuaries and the Sulina mouth to the Black Sea.</p>
<p>It is a clear fact that before the Second World War, the Danube was the major trading artery for seven countries in Central Europe, with a total of about 3,000 ships sailing back and forth, handling 3.5 million to 4 million tons of cargo annually. But now it is in a state of stagnation. While Europe is looking forward to a peaceful resolution, these seven countries, which could have rebuilt their collapsed economies through Danube trade, are now barely surviving on UN relief goods and a small amount of freight.</p>

<h3 id="e182">Potsdam <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>— Zuo Qi</p>
<p>After Germany's surrender in May 1945, the Big Three powers – Britain (Churchill and Attlee), the United States (Truman), and the Soviet Union (Stalin) – convened in Potsdam in July to lay the groundwork for lasting world peace and jointly plan to intensify the war against Japan. On July 26, with the consent of Chinese President Chiang Kai-shek, Churchill and Truman jointly signed and issued the Potsdam Declaration. Before two weeks had passed, Japan accepted the declaration and surrendered. As a result, the term "Potsdam" resonated throughout the world and became a common news term in newspapers.</p>
<p>Potsdam is located about eighteen miles southwest of Berlin, Germany, on the Havel River. The area is scenic and has historically been a royal residence of German emperors, with magnificent buildings. The Potsdam Conference was held in the old palace.</p>
<p>In the preceding period, there were also rumors that the Big Three would meet again in Potsdam to discuss intractable international disputes, but this did not materialize.</p>
<p>Recently, the American Policy Association on China accused the government of having secret agreements concerning China at the Potsdam Conference and demanded their disclosure. However, the U.S. State Department denied the existence of any such agreements.</p>

<h3 id="e183">From Paris to New York, the Center of Gravity Remains with the US and Soviet Union <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>— Chu Yu</p>
<p>The Paris Peace Conference has ended, and representatives from various countries have returned home. Paris, bustling for two months and eighteen days, has suddenly become quiet. The world's attention has also shifted from Paris to New York, across the Atlantic. Not only is the United Nations General Assembly scheduled to open in New York on the 23rd of this month, but the Four Foreign Ministers Conference is also scheduled to be held in New York on the 4th of next month. The United States is currently experiencing a meat shortage, with the general population "lacking meat." Now, with the arrival of a large number of international dignitaries, the U.S. authorities have to treat them sincerely, providing them with delicacies, which will make the shortage even more severe.</p>
<p>Peace is Not Easy, When Will it Be Achieved?</p>
<p>If we temporarily close our eyes and imagine, we can understand that achieving world peace is not an easy task. The European war ended a year and a half ago, and the Pacific war ended more than a year ago, but true peace has not yet arrived in the world. Political and diplomatic figures from various countries are working hard for peace, holding one international conference after another, trying every possible way to restore the post-war world to a normal state as soon as possible, so that all countries can share peace and no longer face the threat of aggressive wars. However, a year and a half of efforts have only completed draft peace treaties for Italy, Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Finland. Other important issues, because they could not be resolved by the Four Foreign Ministers Conference, were handed over to the Paris Peace Conference for discussion. The Paris Peace Conference failed to resolve them and they are now being handed back to the Four Foreign Ministers Conference for handling. This is equivalent to going in a big circle, returning to the original starting point. The problems themselves remain the same, and no progress has been made in resolving them. The people of the world, having suffered from the great catastrophe of this war, have learned their lessons and their desire for peace is too urgent. As long as there is a glimmer of hope, they hope that it can suddenly become clear. Initially, they placed all their hopes on the Foreign Ministers Conference. After that hope was shattered, they placed their hopes on the Paris Peace Conference. Now the Paris Peace Conference has once again made the world feel the sadness of disillusionment. But the world's hopes have shifted to the United Nations General Assembly, and even the future Four Foreign Ministers Conference.</p>
<p>The world's attention shifts with hope, but where is peace after all? It remains an incomprehensible enigma.</p>
<p>An Interlude at the End of the Peace Conference</p>
<p>The final session of the Paris Peace Conference was presided over by Guo Taiqi, acting head of the Chinese delegation, who sang the praises of the conference and hoped that all countries would eliminate their prejudices and work for peace. U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes also said: "Countries should recognize each other; no one country can win alone in war, and at the same time, no one country can achieve peace alone in peacetime. All countries must work together for the benefit of mankind." Subsequently, British Foreign Secretary Bevin and Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov also delivered speeches one after another, and finally French Foreign Minister Bidault gave the closing speech. The conference ended there. However, the representative of Yugoslavia was not seen at the conference session that day. According to his letter to Guo Taiqi, chairman of the final session, Yugoslavia did not approve of the peace treaty with Italy passed by the conference and had decided to withdraw from the conference. The achievements of the Paris Peace Conference were already mediocre enough, but the fact that it exposed a major weakness at the end was truly disappointing.</p>
<p>The Center of Gravity Remains with the US and Soviet Union</p>
<p>The United Nations General Assembly has been decided to open as scheduled, and the Four Foreign Ministers Conference will also be held in New York. Therefore, everyone wants to ask: Will there be good results? Our answer is: "The key to success or failure still lies in US-Soviet relations." Therefore, the world attaches particular importance to the speech delivered by Byrnes on the 18th. The speech contained the following points: (1) The American people are willing to extend a hand of friendship to the Soviet Union; (2) Rumors that the United States is adopting a policy of containment towards the Soviet Union are entirely based on fantasy; (3) Promoting US-Soviet understanding is perhaps the most difficult task for today's political and diplomatic figures; (4) The United States will continue to oppose individual alliance policies; (5) The most worrying aspect of the current international situation is that US-Soviet relations have reached an impasse.</p>
<p>Byrnes's remarks were not only fully agreed upon by President Truman, but even his political rival Wallace expressed satisfaction, believing that Byrnes had made progress, but still hoping that he would continue to improve. Senator Vandenberg also gave a speech in support of Byrnes's policy, saying: "Since the Soviet Union does not want war, and the United States does not want war, I hope that everyone will stop talking about war. The foreign policy of the United States is a policy of peace, and if it is not undermined domestically, it will certainly succeed."</p>
<p>Trade Conference Held in England</p>
<p>The International Trade and Employment Conference initiated by the United States began its preparatory meeting in London on the 15th, discussing the US proposals. Representatives from nineteen countries attended, but the Soviet Union did not participate. US representative Wilcox put forward five basic principles for reviving the world economy: (1) Substantially reduce tariff barriers; (2) Countries should exchange goods with each other; (3) Imports from various countries should not be discriminated against; (4) Countries should maintain a high level of employment; (5) All countries should be equal in the international market.</p>
<p>Our research into the true motive behind the US initiation of this conference is to restore the freedom of post-war international trade. In principle, this is agreed upon by all countries; but in fact, there are still difficulties. The first is the non-participation of the Soviet Union, which inevitably makes the scope of so-called international trade too narrow. The second is that Britain and France cannot temporarily abolish their restrictions on imported goods. The third is that economically backward countries must adopt "moderate protection" in order to implement industrialization. The fourth is that the US promotion of the international free trade movement inevitably carries the color of economic imperialism.</p>
<h3 id="e184">Belgian Foreign Minister Spaak: A Key Intermediary Among Small Countries <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>— Translated by Jianan from "World Report Magazine"</p>
<p>Belgian Foreign Minister Spaak is now an important intermediary between large and small countries. He will once again serve as chairman when the United Nations General Assembly convenes in New York on October 23. The working principle of this socialist politician is to be pragmatic. In his youth, he was an agitator for social movements, having smashed the windows of conservative newspapers. But age and a sense of responsibility have gradually turned him into a rational figure, advocating reason. For example, at the Paris Peace Conference, Australian Foreign Minister Evatt used straightforward language to force concessions from the Big Four, but Spaak used gentle language and compromise.</p>
<p>The major powers categorically rejected Evatt's demand that a majority vote should be binding on the Big Four. But when Spaak, chairman of the Rules Committee, suggested that the major powers should automatically adopt proposals passed by a two-thirds majority, he received the support of U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes.</p>
<p>When Spaak chairs international conferences, he is calm and accurate, truly representing a typical figure of objectivity and impartiality. He represented Belgium in international tennis competitions in 1922. Now, his agility and cleverness in speaking at conferences can be compared to his skill on the court.</p>
<p>Flexible Approach</p>
<p>With Spaak as chairman, debates often do not become deadlocked. When the Big Four face a stalemate, the Belgian Foreign Minister can often propose a flexible solution.</p>
<p>At the Paris Peace Conference, Spaak once told the representatives of various countries that their incessant disputes would make people around the world think that they were not setting terms for the Axis powers, but arguing about the peace issues among themselves.</p>
<p>When Spaak is chairman, he does not allow any representative to be opportunistic. In handling conference affairs, he attaches more importance to the spirit of the rules than to the letter of the rules. He is tolerant of mistakes caused by confusion in the meeting, but he is extremely firm when someone deliberately violates the rules to achieve their own goals.</p>
<p>In his youth, Spaak led socialists to parade through the streets to smash the windows of right-wing newspapers. In his twenties, he became a successful lawyer and first attracted people's attention. He defended communists and wrote fiery pamphlets and speeches for young socialists. But when he became Prime Minister of Belgium at the age of thirty-nine, he was already the leader of the right wing of the Socialist Party and an opponent of the Communist Party.</p>
<p>Outstanding Talent</p>
<p>Spaak is the son of Belgium's first prominent female socialist member of parliament. His father was a poet who wrote the most successful play of the time. In 1938, he became Prime Minister of Belgium.</p>
<p>During World War II, Spaak fled to France and was detained by the Vichy government. He then fled to Spain and was detained by Franco. He broke out of prison, disguised himself as a monk, and traveled through Portugal to London, where he rejoined the Belgian government.</p>
<p>Spaak was first elected to parliament in 1932 and became a cabinet member in 1935, serving as Minister of Foreign Affairs the following year. Since then, he has held this position almost continuously. He is now the foreign minister of the coalition government of the Liberal, Socialist, and Communist parties.</p>
<p>In 1937, Spaak participated in King Leopold's negotiations, which resulted in Belgium breaking away from its military alliance with France and Britain. But isolationism did not prevent Belgium from being invaded, just as neutrality did not save Belgium from crisis in the First World War.</p>
<p>However, unlike King Leopold, Spaak fled abroad and continued to resist. Today, he opposes Leopold's surrender to the Nazis and disapproves of his return to the country. Spaak now advocates close relations with Britain and France and the establishment of a mutual defense agreement, but he insists that this does not mean organizing a "Western bloc."</p>
<p>This policy has led the Soviet Union to oppose his serving as chairman of the United Nations General Assembly. But after seeing Spaak's actual actions, the Soviet side had to admit that he was an excellent chairman.</p>
<p>When the United Nations General Assembly convenes in New York on October 23, he will once again appear before the representatives of various countries as an intermediary between large and small countries.</p>
<h3 id="e185">Reasons for Japan's Defeat: Japanese Journalist Kato Reveals the Truth about the Three Islands Before Surrender <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>A recent book by Kato, a well-known Japanese journalist and current chief writer for the Kyodo News Agency, entitled "Record of Defeat," has been published. It states that before the atomic bombs fell on Japan, American submarines had already dealt Japan a major blow. A month before the atomic bombing of Hiroshima, Emperor Hirohito wanted to seek peace through the Soviet Union. Prior to this, Japan was constantly exploring peace with China. Kato writes his articles in the style of ordinary news reports, beginning with this: "Japan had long been struggling in the throes of death. The sudden arrival of the first atomic bomb on Hiroshima was merely the final blow that hastened its demise. The world's newest and most powerful weapon emerged from the summer sky, destroying the city with just one blow. However, its appearance did not have much impact on the outcome of the Japanese-American war."</p>
<p>Kato strongly tells UN readers about the errors of Japanese totalitarianism. He recounts the mutual distrust between the Japanese army, navy, and civilians, the mismanagement of Japanese skilled workers, and the poor planning in all aspects of the war. He also harshly criticizes the ridiculous pretense of calm that the Japanese army continued to maintain as Japan was on the verge of collapse. He further narrates the enslavement of Japanese newspapers, which, once they regained their freedom, were at a loss for what to do.</p>
<p>At the historic meeting of the cabinet and other leaders on August 14, the prime minister first reviewed the general situation, after which the chiefs of staff of the army and navy, as well as the minister of the army, urged the emperor to reaffirm the national policy and continue the war. At this point, the cabinet secretary quoted the emperor as saying, "If others have no opinions to express, we will express our opinions. We are determined that you agree to this... We believe that there is only one path left to save Japan."</p>
<p>Kato criticizes the propaganda of both Japan and the United States, saying: "In my personal opinion, Japanese propaganda in the Philippines was the most unsuccessful, while propaganda in Burma was the most successful. Success was mainly due to racial appeals and promises. Failure was due to the inability to replace the British and American trends, and the inability or unwillingness to fulfill promises. Especially in the Philippines, the sudden disruption of the supply of American cars, refrigerators, and modern equipment quickly made the natives lose faith in the Japanese talk of co-prosperity."</p>

<h3 id="e187">Bernard Shaw <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Yinhuai</p>
<p>Shaw is ninety years old. July 26 was his birthday. Shaw does not like to celebrate birthdays. Twenty years ago, he swore that he would not celebrate a second one. That was in 1926, when he wrote this: "I can accept all these words of praise for me without shame. But this is my first birthday celebration, and also the last one I intend to celebrate." For this reason, his friends: HG Wells, Professor Murray, Mansfield, Priestley, A. Huxley, and Xiong Shiyi, among others, each wrote a commemorative or research article, compiled into a special collection, to show their respect and love.</p>
<p>This old man is not really old. Although he is a rare antique in the modern literary world who was once a colleague of Victorian writers and has experienced two world wars, few people feel the burden of his age. People only feel that he is a great writer of this century, who has written two modern masterpieces: "Saint Joan" and "Man and Superman"; but they do not know that most of his life has been turned into history. Among the writers who were his contemporaries were Kipling, Hardy, and Wilde. And when his first play (Rhinegold) was published, Tennyson and Browning were still alive.</p>
<p>Shaw was born in Dublin, Ireland. His father was a humorous drunkard; his mother was a highly cultured singer. The family was poor, so his first thirty years were spent in poverty. Throughout his life, he was an intellectual who had not received much formal education; but he had read almost all the famous books on earth. He loved music because his mother was a highly cultured musician, allowing the children to grow up listening to Beethoven and Handel from an early age.</p>

<p>— Clare Winsten</p>
<p>In 1876, Shaw went to London with his family. He tried to write over a thousand words every day, toiling for ten years, and completed five novels and hundreds of short articles, yet only sold them for a total of six pounds. In those years, he lived off his mother, thereby gaining leisure for writing.</p>
<p>From the age of twenty-six, he became a vegetarian—partly for humanitarian reasons, partly for health. He despised meat-eaters. It is said that once, he and the meat-loving great sculptor Rodin mutually ridiculed each other because of this. Shaw was not only abstemious in his appetite, but also in his sexual desire; he was a Puritan. Although he had some correspondence flirtations with the then-popular actress Ellen Terry, she remained faithfully in love with his wife, who had died three years prior.</p>
<p>In 1884, Shaw joined the Fabian Society, which had only been founded a year earlier, and enthusiastically campaigned in the streets for the socialist movement. Three years later, he shifted his focus from the working class to intellectuals, and his sharp and quick eloquence conquered many.</p>
<p>Shaw was not only a social critic, but also an authority in the fields of music and drama criticism. He wrote drama reviews for three years for "Saturday Review," edited by his friend Harris. This was a high-end publication in London at the time, and Shaw's position in the literary world had already been firmly established due to his sharp and witty writing style.</p>
<p>George Bernard Shaw's humor and wit are known worldwide, and everyone sees him as a playful and irreverent jester. In reality, he is an idealist wearing a clown's mask. He saw himself as a prophet of the times; whether that is the case, only time will tell.</p>
<p>However, his cold satire and passionate mockery are only a superficial form, a temporary tool—this is true. He himself once said, "If I didn't joke and laugh like this, I'm afraid no one would be able to bear it." Beneath this mask of satire lies an Irishman's passionate heart, a strong love for humanity, and broad sympathy. He constantly sought ways to improve the situation of the working-class poor and often used his own money to help them. As Chesterton said: Comedians are often the most serious people in the world. In public, he was sharp-tongued and fond of mixed laughter and ridicule; in private, he was a quiet, friendly, and gentle gentleman.</p>
<p>Shaw has now established a brilliant position in literary history, and people often compare him to Shakespeare. (Shakespeare was the person he admired most.) Along with honor, of course, came wealth. Plays brought Shaw a great deal of money. For several years, he was the highest-paid playwright in the world; recently, he has become the highest-paid screenwriter for movies. Films based on his plays earn him one-tenth of the total income. Some completed films include "Pygmalion" and "Major Barbara," and recently completed is the new film "Caesar and Cleopatra." Therefore, when the British side wanted to award him the highest honor on one occasion, he simply refused; he believed that the name George Bernard Shaw no longer needed unnecessary embellishment.</p>
<p>Shaw's important plays include the following: "Arms and the Man" (first performed in 1894), "Candida" (1894), "The Devil's Disciple" (1897), "Caesar and Cleopatra" (1898), "Man and Superman" (1903), first performed in November 1905, "Major Barbara" (November 1905). Later, he wrote "Pygmalion" and his last famous play, "Saint Joan" (1923), and wrote several famous works on economics. It is said that he is still writing a play to this day.</p>

<p>— Huai</p>
<p>George Bernard Shaw's humor is world-renowned. Once, a beautiful actress (not the dancer Duncan) wrote to him proposing marriage. She said, "Your brains plus my figure, we will produce the most perfect child." But Shaw replied, "What if the child inherits my figure and your brains?"</p>
<p>Humor is humor, but most scholars, while admiring Shaw's intellectual brilliance, don't particularly appreciate his clownish facade. He himself is among these people. One evening, after a performance of "Arms and the Man," Shaw was invited to take a bow as the author. At the end of a round of enthusiastic applause, a cold "Boo" suddenly came. Shaw raised both hands to calm the frenzied crowd. Then he turned to face the direction of the booing and said, "I agree with you, my friend. But the opinion of the whole room is exactly the opposite of ours, so what can you and I do?"</p>
<p>In 1925, he refused the Nobel Prize in Literature. His reason for refusing was very interesting: he didn't need the money. The money was about $35,000 US dollars, and he said, "Like a life preserver to a swimmer who has already safely reached the other shore, it is useless."</p>

<p>George Bernard Shaw has a three-story villa in Ayot St. Lawrence with twelve comfortable rooms. The garden occupies an area of ​​one hundred acres. He lives here peacefully and leisurely, leading his writing life. He doesn't smoke, doesn't eat meat, has breakfast at nine o'clock every morning, and reads newspapers—from the stubborn London Times to the Communist "Daily Worker." Then he hides in his work shed, writing until one o'clock. He takes a nap after lunch, and returns to the shed around four o'clock. Until seven o'clock for dinner. In the evening, he reads and listens to the radio, and goes to sleep at eleven o'clock.</p>
<p>His wife, Charlotte Payne-Townshend, passed away three years ago. Now he lives alone in Ayot, employing a driver, gardener, housekeeper and maid. Every July, he must go to London to live for a while, so that the servants can have a rest, and the chimneys, etc., can be cleaned once.</p>

<p>— Written by Professor Murray, translated by Lan Ning</p>
<p>I am sick, but I cannot be omitted from the group of memorialists for GBS, whom I so admire.</p>
<p>Let me reiterate an old inscription. In my book on Aristophanes, I wrote: "Dedicated to my old friend GBS, a lover of ideals, a hater of cruelty, a man who has filled the world with laughter, and whose courage never disappears—"</p>
<p>"Lover of ideals," although I have been with many cultural workers, I doubt that few have lived a spiritual life as intensely as he does, while rarely caring about the physical aspect. He takes the enjoyment of food surprisingly lightly. Vulgarity and carnality are not found in his overflowing wit. Even trauma doesn't seem to bother him much. Once, he was seriously injured, bandaged all over, fractured bones, and bled a lot. I went to see him, always thinking he was lying in bed, but unexpectedly he told me he was on a high hill in the garden. I went in and didn't see anyone, but I could clearly hear bursts of laughter coming from behind a holly bush. I followed the sound and found him. He didn't notice my arrival, didn't notice his own trauma, and was writing with his unbandaged hand, laughing loudly and happily.</p>
<p>Even as a reformer, what interests him is the ideal. Although he faces and understands worldly affairs, I think his excitement is mainly not out of sympathy for human suffering, but more because of the absurdity of the suffering and the facilities that cause it. He reforms with ridicule and cold logic, more than appealing to emotion.</p>
<p>Of course, one cannot forget his extreme "hatred of cruelty," hatred of cruelty whether to humans or to animals. He seems not to belong to our meat-eating race. This race's main pleasure in life is what we call "sports," that is, "hunting," "shooting," and "fishing," often inflicting death and trauma on almost every living and sentient being. Similarly, he hates the oppression of humanity; it's not that he particularly likes foxes in the city or the poor. It's just that he can't bear to see them mistreated.</p>
<p>Praising him for "filling the world with laughter" is too easy to understand, but two points are worth noting. First, I doubt that there has ever been a great intellectual and satirist in human history like him who never attacked private individuals with malice. He would vehemently attack behaviors or facilities that he considered cruel or unfair. However, he never involved private individuals. Like second-rate satirists, or even great predecessors like Voltaire and Aristophanes, he never thought of hurting others as much as they did. However, like these two, he has a great quality that many satirists lack: he has genuine respect and appreciation for masterpieces of poetry, painting, sound, and music. Among contemporary scholars, few have a deeper knowledge of Shakespeare studies than him. He is always paying attention to the geniuses of his contemporaries (not envy or jealousy); he has rejoiced for Tolstoy, Ibsen, Maeterlinck, and Rodin. He tirelessly gives help to young British writers.</p>
<p>His "courage never disappears." I am not only referring to his fearless attack on all vested beliefs or facilities with privilege and authority. He attacked conservatism and excessive rhetoric, superstition and science, as long as he thought that one of them was too authoritative, he attacked it regardless of everything. He also has a rare quality: the courage of genius, or I might even call it the stubbornness of genius. I still remember when his first play was published, everyone thought it was impossible to put on the stage. Theater managers all said that he had a bit of dramatic talent; as long as he could change his obscure script, or find a writer with quick wit and knowledge of the theater to help him rewrite it, they might be quite worth performing. But twenty years later, he finally persevered and wrote a script that someone dared to perform—"Arms and the Man." It immediately achieved success, and not long after, Shaw gained his current position and became Europe's most famous and widely read playwright.</p>
<p>In addition to all his amazing talents, he is one of the most kind and generous people. I will not call him the smartest person. His practical talent is not constructive, but analytical. Once, he defended several of his works in "Saturday Review," boldly writing, "Who am I, that I should be fair and impartial?" This is an honest defense. It is not his job to weigh the factors of dispute, carefully synthesize them, and point out a proper path. Officials and rulers can do these. Shaw's job is to point out those wrong but unrecognized things; sometimes, he even does so with exaggerated or biased strokes, so that people can face those things that they cannot see or do not want to see.</p>

<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>I never knew what it meant to be busy, what it meant to be tired, but in our Tongxian Provisional Action Headquarters office, apart from other things, just look at the personnel coming and going, reporting, commanding, dispatching; and listen to the ding-a-ling of the telephone, and the faint, secret buzzing of the telegraph machine from the next room, ringing and buzzing non-stop, the captain, holding the earpiece in one hand, receiving telegrams in the other, issuing orders with his mouth, and reading reports with his eyes; all of this and so on, even just sitting there minding your own business, just listening and watching, would make you feel dizzy, headache, and tinnitus.</p>
<p>The head from Peiping is now in the Twelfth Regiment, and has taken office as the provisional chief of staff. In reality, he is monitoring the puppet autonomous army, fearing that it will take overstepping actions. On the one hand, I assist the team leader in handling affairs in the office, and on the other hand, I and Tiger are also responsible for the external liaison work after the launch. This responsibility sounds easy and ordinary, but as long as you close your eyes and imagine it, at that time, inside and outside the city, soldiers and horses galloping, guns and cannons shaking the sky, bullets flying around, people shouting, the whole city will be turned into a pot of boiling water in a killing, and you have to manage the situation in all directions, receive and send reports, and make decisions in this chaotic boiling. One mistake, and you may have to pull out a gun and fight for a while. Thinking about it this way, our job is not very easy.</p>
<p>Like me, Tiger is wearing the uniform of the "Security Team," the only difference is that he has shaved his head into a bald monk, while I still have a boy's haircut. At this time, he was lounging in the office with nothing to do, closing one eye and dozing off, the open eye was probably to pay attention, lest he be left behind when we went out. Because the team leader has teased him several times, saying that he is too young, and afraid that he won't be able to suppress people when he starts working. In private, however, he is praised as being omnipotent.</p>
<p>When things are busy, time passes very quickly, and in a flash it is more than three o'clock. The team leader saw that everyone was a little sleepy, so he called the logistics and ordered them to open a few bottles of wine, and take out some ready-made canned food, biscuits and snacks, etc., to wake everyone up, and at the same time, everyone "Cheers" to pre-celebrate the victory and success. The first person to be alarmed was Tiger, and the one eye that was closed immediately opened.</p>
<p>There is another matter about Tiger that should be reported here. Tiger has been much more silent since he came to Tongxian than before. In the past, in front of a large crowd, he would not often interrupt and speak, unless he felt that this sentence had to be said, then he would open his mouth; but when he was alone with me, he was not very silent, and was very trivial, somewhat like an old woman's nagging. These past two days have been a little different, even when he is with me, he doesn't speak; doesn't ask, doesn't answer; as if he has something big on his mind.</p>
<p>Yesterday was especially special. Early in the morning, he asked me for a hundred dollars, saying that he had met someone from near the village who was going home, and he wanted to ask that person to donate some money to his mother. This amount is quite large (in the past, the most he asked for was one dollar for a haircut, a bath, or to buy some snacks); not to mention that, and at the time I proved that he was lying, because when he lied, his big round eyes would blink at least three or four times in a row, this is always accurate. It wasn't that I couldn't immediately pierce his bubble, but I was curious for a moment, and wanted to see what he was up to.</p>
<p>After he took the money, he immediately smiled, talked about everything, and forced out some words to make me laugh; and asked me for two hours of leave (because in public affairs, he is my assistant, and my subordinate, and he must ask me for leave to go out.) I simply agreed very readily, only telling him to go quickly and come back quickly, and don't delay public affairs. I originally planned to secretly follow him to see where he was going, but unfortunately the team leader asked me to talk, and I didn't have time for a while, and let Tiger slip away. He did come back in less than two hours, and I was too lazy to ask further; because it would be useless to ask, knowing that he had already prepared a set of words to deal with me; so why bother?</p>
<p>These past two days have been so busy, but I have been paying attention to his actions at all times. In addition to being overly silent, he is constantly blinking his eyes, as if he is thinking about something. Even at this time, in the office, although he is sitting in the corner of the room on a soft chair, closing one eye to rest, I don't think he is necessarily sound asleep, he must be planning something there.</p>

<p>Happiness</p>
<p>Two things called "happiness" that are not happy now.</p>
<p>One is the dispute between the comedian broadcaster Xiao Kuaihuo and Senator Lu Keming, which makes everyone unhappy; the other is the lawsuit between the "Kuaihuo Lin" weekly magazine and the two road bureau chiefs Chen Bozhuang, which has not yet been resolved.</p>
<p>Mayor's Wisdom</p>
<p>Mayor Wu's chauffeur ignored a red light, and the police first stopped him and then let him go, but the mayor sent his secretary to the police station to order that he himself be punished for violating traffic rules. The mainland newspaper commented:</p>
<p>"Sometimes, Mayor Wu Guozhen will use extremely subtle methods to express his thoughts..."</p>
<p>I think the mayor didn't do a thorough job. In addition to ordering that he himself be punished for violating traffic rules, he should also punish the biased traffic police officer who first stopped and then let him go.</p>
<p>Injections</p>
<p>Traveling requires injections, otherwise you can't buy a boat ticket. Here is a survey form:</p>
<p>From Shanghai to Fujian: cholera, smallpox, plague;</p>
<p>To Tianjin: cholera, smallpox, typhoid;</p>
<p>To Ningbo and Wuhan: cholera;</p>
<p>To Taiwan: smallpox, plague, typhoid;</p>
<p>To Guangdong: smallpox, plague;</p>
<p>In short, every step you take, you have to get an injection. I'm a layman, are these injections to prevent infectious diseases in the places you are going? Or are you afraid that people will bring infectious diseases from Shanghai to those places?</p>

<p>Human·Relations·World·Affairs</p>
<p>I wonder if God and mankind are deliberately joking? Or are they adding many thrilling and bizarre patterns to this vast world? Therefore, since the beginning of history, there have been more poor people than rich people anywhere; it is not surprising that there are more poor people, but the wonderful thing is that they also put a few rich and noble people in the mix, so in this noisy world, the poor people have goals in life, the goal of climbing up; climbing all day, climbing every year, until they can't climb anymore and lie down. Seeing the bustling crowds, lost in the dust, climbing up and falling down, falling down and climbing up again, it is pleasing to the eye and very beautiful!</p>
<p>After thousands of years of climbing, the poor have gradually gained some experience and insight. They understand the method of climbing that doubles their efforts. After doing this for a long time, you can take a breath, stretch your waist, wash off the mud, and be a human being. You must not think of the inferiority and pity in front of other people's feet when you are climbing. You should remember that this climbing method is a dogma that the ancestors have painstakingly left behind from generation to generation, and the descendants must carry on the teachings of their ancestors and carry them forward.</p>
<p>The poor have a sour smell, which is the biggest obstacle when climbing in front of the rich; so you should have self-knowledge, and despite your shabby clothes, you should look cheerful and welcoming, and your conversation should be gentle and flattering, but not cliché; for example, if you know that the master you are flattering is a descendant of the Qing Dynasty, a local gentry, then when you are holding a water pipe and agreeing with his wishes, you should scold science and hate people, but you cannot overly deny science and people, because the old masters are very clear that this time the Japanese were indeed defeated by the atomic bomb; if your master is a person who believes that their ancestors immigrated from Europe or America, then you should boast about how magnificent the Alps are compared to several earthen mounds in northwest China, and emphasize that the Mississippi River is much more majestic than several muddy ditches in southeastern China; in the midst of your conversation, if the master's children "John" and "Little Mary" are eating with ration food boxes, this is another wonderful opportunity; you can start by constantly praising how foreign countries attach importance to and reasonably distribute national nutrition, and then analyze the ignorance, poverty, and poor appearance we showed in this war, and draw the conclusion by depicting the luxurious scene of people throwing surplus materials into the sea; you are barking like a dog and imitating the sound, shrugging your shoulders and pretending, and the masters will also shake their heads and smile without saying a word, and then when he meditates for a while, he pats you on the shoulder and says: "Old brother is really a discerning person!" You must not panic, bow your head and listen, expressing that you have met a patron, you have no regrets even in death, and you are willing to listen to his orders, or do anything to repay his kindness!</p>
<p>And so on, if you happen to meet a master who used to be a traitor, and is now still sitting high above one person and above millions of people somewhere, you must not tell him: the news that a close friend who used to be in the same temple with him has been executed; if you have a master who became rich by "national disaster wealth," "victory wealth," and "reception wealth," and was spared investigation due to his long sleeves and good dancing, you should explain to him: that the wealth that comes without asking is originally the principle of taking it without harming integrity and being generous; if you happen to encounter a master who has just climbed up like you, you should express your understanding and comprehension of his "climbing method," and prostrate yourself, stating "I am born with a humble appearance and cannot reach high," congratulating him on being able to support later generations, which is really the demeanor of an elder and the intention of a benevolent person. You should climb slowly along their feet, and pat their backs lightly, then: the masters will regard you as a close friend, the compatriots will treat you as a slave and a dog, and the group below who also pat your ass will directly regard you as "a lifelong model," then you can be considered to have climbed up a level.</p>
<p>After you have climbed up, although you are still far from the standard of great wealth and honor, you may as well take a small rest and relax your claws that have been exhausted from climbing; at this time, you can brag to the younger generations who are climbing up following your feet, and to the friends who are struggling in the "climbing ranks"; to the former, you should put on a solemn appearance and explain to them the essence and subtlety of the "philosophy of climbing," and to the latter, you should proclaim the logic of "Hu Shih is my friend," and especially introduce your former masters, explaining that these are all relatives, old friends, and fellow villagers; although they feel that your bombastic remarks are overwhelming, they can do nothing about it, and still have to express that I am not as good as you and respect you very much; in this way, you can leave the circle of the poor step by step. However, you also have to pay attention to the timing, and look for a richer master to offer your past skills, flattering as usual, climbing when you are done flattering, and bragging again when you climb up, bragging in all directions, and everyone follows you, and you end up climbing to the "celebrity" throne, you may as well steal some time from your busy schedule and shout a high-pitched "Wealth is like floating clouds to me," and hum a low-pitched "Be grateful for the times and cherish your blessings," and you are guaranteed to be in harmony with a hundred voices and leave a lasting reputation!</p>
<p>The philosophy of "climbing" is like this, I am willing to make it public, the vast world, the sea of suffering is boundless, there are too many poor people, turning back is the shore, may we climb together and reach the Pure Land together! Amitabha.</p>

<p>There are two kinds of property that must never be wasted arbitrarily; one is the body, and the other is time. The increase of knowledge and the success of career all depend on this!</p>
<p>Cleverness is a thing that often mixes with laziness.</p>
<p>Courtship and lending money are two difficult problems in life, (but as long as they are not abused, then muster up the courage.</p>
<p>To be a strong person, not a weak person; the so-called strong is to be strong in being able to manage oneself, control oneself, and dominate oneself. And know that; practicing one maxim is stronger than saying a hundred maxims.</p>
<h3 id="e198">Quasi-Foreigner <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>— Bi Jun</p>
<p>In a certain church university in Shanghai, nine out of ten of the more than nine hundred students are Chinese, and one out of ten are foreign students. Among the nine-tenths of Chinese students, there are a few who speak foreign languages fluently, wear foreign clothes, and have foreign names. They are practically Chinese people who look like foreigners. These students can never be satisfied with being Chinese, but they claim to be Chinese!</p>
<p>Although not all Chinese people necessarily know Chinese characters, a Chinese person must be able to speak Chinese (unless they are mute). It is truly shameful to discover students who do not know their own national characters, especially in China's highest institutions of learning. This group of Chinese students who cannot speak their own language is simply shameless. Originally, there was a "Chinese" course in the first year of the school, but they were exempted from it, just like the real foreign students. Indeed, they are not much different from foreigners; they speak foreign languages, look like foreigners, and some even have birth certificates from Madagascar, Columbia... They were born in foreign environments, speak foreign languages, are protected by foreigners, and attend schools managed by foreigners. They receive different treatment from Chinese students at school. If you happen to talk to them for a while, they will shamelessly tell you in a foreign language, "I am also Chinese."</p>
<p>They receive preferential treatment at school because the people in charge are foreigners. They can avoid paying tuition and eat without spending money. The expenses of these students with unclear nationalities are entirely made up for by the tuition fees of Chinese students. The fists of these half-foreigners when they are excited are also received by Chinese students. They clearly look down on Chinese people, but they often express in words that they are Chinese!</p>
<p>Seeing that overseas Chinese schools are being banned from teaching Chinese by the authorities, the overseas Chinese are indignantly calling for action. Seeing the slave-like nature of these "quasi-foreigners" makes me want to cry but I can't, and I want to laugh but I can't!</p>

<h3 id="e200">Turtle King <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Qiang</p>
<p>No matter how high or low the occupation, as long as it is managed properly, you can "excel in any profession." Two brothers in New York's Broadway—Al Gould and Stanton Gould—have become rich by selling painted turtles and can be said to be "top students" outside of the 360 professions.</p>
<p>Eight years ago, the Gould brothers started this novel business. After several years of hard work, the business flourished, and they have become wholesalers of "hard-shelled products." Gift shops and dime stores all over the United States carry these novelties. In addition to the old store on Broadway, they have added several branches in downtown Manhattan.</p>
<p>These "hard-shell products" are turtles painted with various colors, about the size of a pocket watch, and sell for an average of forty-five cents each. Customers can choose a name or a few words to be engraved on the turtle's back in indelible ink. Some people engrave their girlfriend's name, some use them as birthday or wedding gifts, some use them for advertising or display, and some even use them for marriage proposals.</p>
<p>Hollywood star Bing Crosby once ordered a batch of "hard-shelled products" for his four children. Shirley Temple, Deanna Durbin, and other Hollywood stars are fond of these novelties. Even the serious Charlie Chaplin could not "avoid vulgarity." Former British Prime Minister Chamberlain once mail-ordered fifty of them to give to his grandchildren. The package for the turtles is a special box with ventilation holes and lined with damp moss.</p>
<p>There are many reasons to buy these slow-moving animals. Parents often buy two larger turtles to take home and paint for their children. A week later, they buy a smaller one, and after the children go to sleep that night, they put the little turtle with its "parents." The next morning, the children discover this "miracle" and shout with joy, saying that the little turtle was brought by "cranes."</p>
<p>Some people believe that turtles bring good luck, so they buy one for "good luck." Others who are too lazy to reply to letters and feel bad about it send a turtle with the inscription: "My reply is as slow as this guy."</p>
<p>The most interesting customer of the Gould brothers is a father of two children. He bought three turtles and made a fortune. He engraved the names of his two children on two turtles, respectively, and the name of his family's wealthy friend Nana on the other. Later, Nana visited his house and saw her "namesake." She was touched by the gesture of friendship and took out a sum of money to establish an educational fund for the two children.</p>
<p>The Gould brothers have turtle farms in two towns in Louisiana. About 15,000 turtles arrive in New York every week, arranged in rows in boxes filled with moss, most of which come from Louisiana. After arriving in New York, the turtles are placed in large buckets to await "manufacturing." The first step is to apply a layer of protective white to the turtle's shell. Then, these little creatures are clamped up in strings of a dozen at a time with a yardstick, while a skilled female worker brushes them. Then they are placed on a rack to dry. The next step is to add a thick layer of enamel—red, yellow, and blue are the three most popular colors.</p>
<p>If the turtle is large, it is suitable for birthdays or weddings. After the turtles are selected, appropriate pictures are painted on their backs with special pigments. The "finished" turtles are displayed in partially filled buckets of water—the water in the buckets is warm in winter to prevent hibernation, and cool in summer to "relieve the heat."</p>
<p>The Gould brothers sell a special turtle feed containing dried ant eggs and dried flies. The former comes from Finland, and the latter comes from Mexico.</p>
<p>The Gould brothers also sell another novelty: small alligators. However, the "Turtle King" complains that alligators are not very tame, are not easy to obtain year-round, and do not have much appeal. Therefore, from a business standpoint, the Gould brothers still prefer turtles.</p>

<h3 id="e201">National Treasure · White-Haired Youth: The Witty Mr. Wu Zhihui (Part 1) <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>— Jifeng</p>
<p>Everyone is familiar with this aloof and witty Mr. Wu Zhihui. When senior officials of the National Government take office, he is the veteran supervisor, and there is always an admonition, with a few witty remarks interspersed in the solemnity. On the 15th of this month, Mr. Fang Zhi, the new chairman of the city party headquarters, was sworn in, and the presiding officer was none other than this 81-year-old Mr. Wu. Recently, Mr. Wu also presided over the National Language Promotion Committee in Shanghai (see this newspaper on the 16th).</p>
<p>Morality and Writing</p>
<p>Mr. Wu is a veteran of the Kuomintang, and his morality and writing are the best of the age. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek respects him as a "national treasure," Feng Yuxiang once called him a "white-haired youth," and Hu Shi praised him as "one of the great thinkers of the last three hundred years." He is extremely aloof, strives to restrain himself, and has always taken not being an official, not riding in rickshaws, and not using servants as his guiding principles in life. In Chongqing, he often wore old cloth clothes, carried a cane, and walked around the streets. The "anti-war house" where he lived had thin tiles and a bamboo-framed roof, and was built of bamboo and mud. The furnishings were very simple, and the room could only accommodate a few people.</p>
<p>Changed His Name to Jingheng</p>
<p>Mr. Wu was originally from Xueyanqiao, Wujin. When he was a boy, he went to Yanghu County (under the jurisdiction of Changzhou Prefecture) to take the children's examination. Because his accent sounded like someone from Wuxi, the other candidates suspected that he was impersonating, and they beat him in a group. Therefore, Mr. Wu Zhihui hated it so much that he considered himself a native of Wuxi for the rest of his life. In the 17th year of Guangxu, he passed the imperial examination. However, he was extremely opposed to feudal ideas. Once, Mr. Wu's clan was compiling the genealogy, and he did not approve of it. He angrily overturned all the character plates, which greatly angered the clan chief and the mediators. He had no choice but to flee his hometown. In the 24th year of Guangxu, he served as the principal of Nanyang Public School in Shanghai, and together with Yuan He Chen Chu-zhi, he agreed not to read thread-bound books again. He also believed that lacking respect and sincerity was not enough to bear the weight of the world," so he changed his name to Jingheng.</p>
<p>In the 10th year of the Republic, he served as the vice-principal of the Sino-French University in Lyon and led a group of students abroad. One day, Mr. Wu picked up a note on the ship, personally washed it clean, and then issued a notice: "A smelly pair of pants was found on the ground and has been washed clean. Whose is it? Please claim it." Sometimes, when students threw melon seeds and nutshells everywhere, Mr. Wu would personally hold a broom and sweep them clean.</p>
<p>Vowed Not to Be an Official</p>
<p>In the 13th year of the Republic, he served as a member of the Central Supervisory Committee and has been re-elected ever since. As a founding elder of the country, he is the elder of the elders. Moreover, because he vowed not to be an official, he does not hold any other positions except as a member of the Supervisory Committee, and he does not easily participate in important meetings. Therefore, he has also won the only title of "a famous recluse in the court." (To be continued)</p>
