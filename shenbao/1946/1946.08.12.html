<h3 id="c1">和平未屆絕望階段　馬帥司徒決續努力　癥結問題迄無解決途徑 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>﹝本報南京十一日電﹞今晚七時，周恩來偕王炳南，應約赴美大使館晚餐後，與司徒大使，傅涇波顧問會談，迄十時以後始辭出美使館，所談內容仍俙舊問題，如整軍方案，蘇北撤軍﹞地方政權等，惟均無結果，僅再將各癥結問題，交換意見而已。聞共產黨方面對讓步一層，早無考慮餘地。司徒大使明日將再訪馬帥，傅達今日周恩來之意見，馬帥之是否去牯，將視商討周氏意見結果如何再作決定，由此可知兩氏並未放棄對和平之最後努力。</p>
<p>﹝本報南京十一日電﹞共產黨代表團今日曾舉行內部會議，對於馬帥曁司徒大使昨日所發表之聲明，作慎重之研討，並待延安方面之指示，再行決定對外聲明。周恩來可能於明日舉行記者招待會。</p>
<p>﹝本報南京十一日電﹞馬歇爾特使於今晨九時赴美大使館訪晤司徒大使，談兩小時，據悉：兩氏對此次斡旋和平所得結果如此，頗感失望，惟兩氏一致認爲和平談判之門並未關閉，如雙方能再就問題癥結，即撤兵後之地方行政種一點，能互作讓步，當仍可繼續其談判，兩氏並靜候國共兩方對彼等昨日發表聲明之反響，以決定其行止。昨晚外界所傳今日馬帥飛潯之說，今是馬帥加以否認。</p>
<p>﹝本報南京十一日電﹞和平商談中之撤兵及地方行政權問題，以共產黨拒絕接受政府意見，致使司徒大使與馬帥對斡旋和平所作之努力頓感失望，遂有此聯合聲明之發表，惟兩氏認爲如雙方能再讓步，談判似仍可繼綫。</p>
<p>﹝中央社牯嶺十一日電﹞此間人士對馬歇爾司徒雷登大之發表聯合聲蝗，並不感覺驚奇，各方對兩氏聯合聲明之反響，一致良好，第一，從聯合聲明中能了然兩氏不辭辛勞，不畏艱阻，以奔走和平之苦心，熱情與勇氣；第二，繼續和平商談之發展程度，可從聯合聲明中增加其眞切認識；第三，目前不能獲致協議之癥結，在因商決駐軍地區而所引起之撤軍地區，地方政府之性質問題，僉認以分裂代替統一，以自治保證割據，爲共產黨一貫作風，然軍令政令必須統一，又爲現代國軍必備之基本條件，如何化矛盾爲統一，兩氏必能謀得合理之解決。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十一日電〕聞馬帥擬於最近期內對安平事件發表一文告，表明態度，並悉該文告現正由馬帥鄭重研究中。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十一日電〕司徒大使已決定星期三離京飛平，處理燕大校務，約一週後返京。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京十一電〕據司徒大使之顧問傳涇波稱：馬帥最近不致返美，四上廬山行亦無所聞。</p>
<h3 id="c2">對馬帥司徒之聲明　各方反應不盡同　多數認可視作最後通牒 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>〔合衆社南京十日電〕據消息靈通之外交人士今晚表示：昨日馬帥與司徒大使聯合發表之聲明，不必認爲斡旋失敗之表示，而可視爲對作戰雙方致送最後通牒，促其退而言和。多數觀察家稱，彼等於披讀文告時，最初均信馬帥與司徒二氏已公開宣佈談判停頓，然將此項文件細加查考後，認爲此係斬釘截鐵之最後通牒，殆無可疑。</p>
<p>〔合衆社南京十日電〕此間政界相信，馬帽與司徒大使於聯合聲明中，宣告談判已臨絕境，此事表示，美國實有重行檢討其對華政策之必要，目前險象環生，橫亙二十載國共二黨間之政爭重見於戰塲，似屬信而有徵之事。若干政治人物則稱，美國有三條路可走，即不干水政策，不進不退（美國現所採取者），及無條件支持國民政府。此輩人士堅持，美國須使對華政策與其世界政策配合步調。晤見中共發言人時，詢以其對聯合聲明之觀感如何，彼等稱；中共尙在研究中。</p>
<p>某要人之談話</p>
<p>〔本報北平十一日電〕馬歇爾，司徒雷登聯合聲明發表後，此間某有關要人對記者稱：「從此談判恐怕要暫時擺一擺了，」發言人暗示記者，若干在談判不能解決之問題，勢將以另種方式解決。發言人復判斷馬帥即將暫時返國，但對司徒雷登之是否繼續留任爲大使，則保留判斷，至在此種情勢下，軍調部是否「關門」問題，發言人稱，勢行部仍將繼續存在。（蔡文治但不宜宣佈其姓名）</p>
<p>葉劍英之意見</p>
<p>〔本報北平十一日電〕記者今日訪葉劍英，詢對馬歇爾，司徒雷登聯合聲明意見，問答如下：（問）你對承合聲明有何感想？（答）今天上午很忙，現在我才剛剛開始研究；（問）這是不是表明談判已無法進行？（答）談判確切未獲結果，但是也沒有顯明表示談判已經破裂。（問）你判斷馬帥是否將回國一行？（答）看不出來。（問）你看司徒雷登是否繼續留任大使？（答）難說。（問）執行部是否將繼續存在？（答）南京三人會談存在一天，執行部也會存在一天。</p>
<p>軍調部將結束</p>
<p>〔合衆社北平十一日電〕自昨日馬歇爾特使與司徒雷登大使發表聯合聲明以後，軍事調處執行總部因不能完成其和平使命而有結束傾向，至今晚愈見其迫於眉睫。</p>
<p>〔聯合社北平十一日電〕軍事調處執行總部美國分部今日正等待南京命令，以使結束。美國人曾經澈底研究馬歇爾與司徒雷登共同宣言者，認爲其中不能覓取中國和平之希望。觀於此項聲明，彼等深信軍調部將取消。</p>

<p>〔本報牯嶺十一日電〕中外人士久已期待蔣主席對當前時局發表聲明，表示政府對各項問題採取之方針。昨日馬歇爾特使，司徒雷登大使在南京發表之聯合聲明全文到在牯嶺後，此間人士更迫切注意國民政府所持之政策。據悉：蔣主席八一四文告，正在定稿中。聞文告將重申政府和平解決之方針。記者相信，此一重要聲明，對於當前之難題及其所引起之揣測及傳聞，必可收澄清之效，而政府對於馬歇爾特使，司徒大使之使命，協助其成功之誠意，亦必有所流露。</p>

<p>〔本報北平十一日電〕安平事件發生迄今，已屆兩週，但奉命調查安平事件之執行部廿五小組，截至今日枝節橫生，不能開始其調查工作。一般判斷，如小組工作再受到阻碍，美方呆能單獨進行調查工作，以便宜迅速完成其報告書，因美官民期待明瞭安平事件眞相，已有不耐之象也。廿五小組十一日晨九時再度開會，歷時四十分，仍無結果而散。據主席戴維斯稱：執行部三委員對本組工作之指示，截至開會時尙未收到，嗣即試探提議聽取海軍陸戰隊報告，共產黨代表黃逸峯仍表反對，戴維斯遂宣布聽候三委員指示，十二日晨再舉行會議。國據葉劍英稱：彼已接周恩來指示，謂馬帥已同意調查安平事件之小組由三方輸流主席，並在調查之前，先討論調查程序，惟截至今日，尙未收到南京三人會議有關此事之正式命令。</p>

<p>〔本報南京十一日電〕對於蘇北共軍決堤一舉，今日共產黨之新華社淮陰十日電曾稱：「一小部份由於天然原因，大部份則爲國民黨內戰政策所造成」，對蘇北水災禍首原因，全部卸責於國民黨，然就水災地區形勢觀之，吾人可獲如下之認識：（一）宿遷城南的泛區，在造成洪澤湖的延長並連結窑灣泛區，如以淮隊爲中心，則此泛區將形成一弧形狀態，進可以堵國軍於弧綫以外，退可以拱衛蘇北共軍心臟之淮隊城。（二）運河車站一帶，在運河以西泛濫區域，其形勢乃爲阻拒國軍自徐州方面之襲擊，現龍池集已入，而宿遷其能幸免者，實因共軍在宿遷有兵力之故。（三）東海泛區距東海城僅數里，然因東海城地勢較高，故未波及。唯其北面已與黃海相接，由西向南連接灌雲泛區，將東海陷於孤立。就全勢觀之，泛區大部份不在共軍區內，顯然爲其有計劃之破壞，藉水勢作壁壘也。而其影響所及，已予吾人極明顯之印象。</p>

<p>〔中央社紐約九日電〕據副國務卿艾克遜稱：美國絕未考慮以美國式之訓練或甚至最小限度之裝備需要以供給共產黨軍隊，除非共產黨軍隊不久即有興國軍統編，而爲一統一國軍之希望。渠之聲明發表於七月卅一日，致新近成立之美國對華政策協會之執委柯爾伯之函中，該函係答覆七月廿四日美國對華政劸會就美國對華政策，尤其就風傳共產黨軍隊在未與國軍合併以前，即以美國訓練之裝備供給共產黨軍隊一說，對國務院所提之質問。該函國引述一九四五年十二月十五日總統之一段聲明，認爲該聲明仍係美國對華政策之基礎，美政府向來反對以武力解決政治問題，而馬歇爾將軍刻又正竭盡全力，使中國之兩大政治集團能和平合作，共組由各黨代表參加之聯合政府，以完成美政府之希望，此固爲人所週知者也。武力方面固應合併，政治方面亦必須合併，一九四六年二月廿五日在重慶簽字之關於軍隊整編統編之協議，實爲國共雙方軍隊實行整編統編之根據，對於裝備訓練之標信互不相同之軍隊，如實行任何之統編，必須假以一個相等時間，俾實行統編時混亂情形可滅至最小限度，但除非共產黨軍隊不久即有與國軍實行統編，而成爲中華民國之統一軍隊之希望之時，美國絕無意以美國式之訓練或甚至最小限度之裝備需要以供給共產軍隊。在國民政府直接統治下之軍隊，根據史迪威將軍所提出之戰時三十九師之計劃，即等於每軍三師之十三個軍，每軍均有美國之軍器裝備，其中並有二十師已完全經過美國之訓練。美國對華政策協會係最近成立，主席爲鮑威爾副主席爲費吳生夫人，發起人尙有美勞工同盟會長葛林達爾特，茅斯大學校長霍普金斯，布魯克學院院長吉定，報紙雜誌發行人柯沃斯等。</p>
<p>〔中央社紐約九日電〕美對華政策協會執行委員會委員會委員哥爾伯，九日已公布渠於七月卅一日致覆代理國務卿艾克遜有關美國對華政策之函件，柯氏在該函中提出八點，要求答覆，以便宜對華政策協會委會「對貴部對華政策之各方面能有更佳之了解」。據柯氏調：下列各問題，乃係該會於七月廿四日第一次致國務院函所提出而未獲覆者：（一）吾人對援助，是否端視中國政府履行共黨之要求，而不論其要求是否合理耶？（二）如中國政府願遵守馬歇爾本年一月卅一日，四月廿五日所斡旋之協定，而共黨仍堅持政府一再讓步，美軍是否因中國缺乏統一而撤退？（三）馬歇爾是否奉令經迫中國政府接受共產黨進一步之要求？（四）一九四五年八月十四日中蘇條約中，蘇聯曾允協助中國國尼政府，並無任何附帶條件，而美國對華援助，何須視中國是否與共產黨獲致協議而定？（五）官方是否曾獲共產黨違反馬歇爾四月十日所斡旋之政治協定條款之消息，果爾則閣下是否準備公佈是項通知或聲明？（六）關於赫爾利一九四四及一九四五年所作之協商，本委員會魯有聲明，該聲明實質上是否正確，公布赫爾利之報告，目前尙非其時耶？（七）强迫中國政府與共黨組織聯合政府，豈不演成中國淪爲蘇聯附庸國之結局，一如波蘭，南斯拉夫乎？（八）門戶開放與中國領土完整，是否仍爲吾人之基本政策？美對政策協會七月二十四日致國務院函中，曾詢美政府是否改變門戶開放政策爲戲幕政策？</p>
<p>美政府所表示之意見，以爲「美在華陸戰隊四人之死，並非主要問題」，而「中國共產黨之抗及美陸戰隊開闢經共黨地區之交通綫頗爲振振有詞」。該函簃：就後點而言，則爲一月十日協定中國共雙方與馬歇爾元帥所同意者。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十日電〕關於馬歇爾物使及司徒雷登大使聯合聲明中承認無法調處中國戰事說，頃據國務院稱，此訊尙未獲得證實。某發言人稱：在國務院未曾獲得此說之證實以前，不致有何官方批評。國會方面對於該項聲膽之反響頗不一致，有謂「美國軍隊自華撤退，愈早愈妙」；有建議美國應「更堅強之行動」，以「澄清中國大局」。</p>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓十日電〕今日下午此間各報突刋出馬歇爾元帥與司徒雷登大使之聯合聲明，內容等於承認其在華和平使命之失敗，便各該報並未立即加以評論。</p>

<h3 id="c27">馬司聯合聲明以後的時局 <a href="#c27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>謹向政府和人民鄭重提供我們的建議</p>
<p>我們萬分感佩兩位友邦調人馬帥和司徒大使，十日下午再首都發表聯合聲明。如昨報所載，這聲明的要點有三：（一）他們始終在研討各種可能方法終止目前的衝突，并着手開始改組政府；（二）和平爲全中國人民一致之願望，要避免經濟崩潰更須立謀政局之解決，且政府與共黨領袖亦均渴望停戰，可是戰爭範圍反日益擴大；（三）必須立待解決而迄難獲致協議的問題中，爲１軍隊之重新部署，與２撤軍地區之地方政府性質問題。</p>
<p>我們前晚讀了這條電訊，震驚之下，千言萬語，無從說起，惟有幾種甜酸苦辣的感覺。（一）馬司兩使，高年盛署，爲中國和平而奔走斡旋，雖還沒有慶幸成功，但剝蘭抽蕉，到今天已祗剩了兩個似乎難獲協議的問題，如能百尺竿頭，更進一步，「誠能格物」，前途仍有光明。這似乎是甜的。（二）勝利一年，黃金時代白白消逝，中國事中國人不能自家了，有勞盟友如此吃力費神，而還不肯忍讓爲國，我們一想到蘇北皖北鄂豫邊境大同城郊水深火熱的同胞，如何能不酸鼻？（三）中國人民够苦了！吃了八年抗戰的苦還不足，更須受內亂蔓延之苦。盟友這樣不忍地來救苦救難，而製造內亂的好戰之徒，爭持一年，偏還要加些苦頭給人民吃，眼看和平一時無望，苦味不知何時可以嚐了！（四）戰時中國原是「四強」之一，到後來變爲「五強」而中國退居五強之末，及莫斯科會議而集中於「三強」了，巴黎外長會議雖又由三強而改爲「四強」，可是中國已不在「四強」之內，由曾經亡過國的法蘭西取而代之了。中國內亂擴大一次，國際地位即降落一次；中國內亂加深一次，國際地位即削弱一次。我們每天讀報，無時不感覺辣得閉不攏口來。馬司兩使得聲明，我們相信一定更增加一般人這些甜酸苦辣的感覺。</p>
<p>但是，甜也罷，酸也罷，苦也罷，辣也罷，生爲今日的中國人，不能不力謀解決今日的中國事。馬司聲明，有人以爲顯示調處努力的失敗，甚至稱它是悲劇；外面還傳說馬帥準備下月回美，似更暗示局勢很難挽回。我們的看法，却不盡然。第一，馬司聲明中並未明白指出他們已經失敗，無意再作調處。</p>
<p>第二，路透社電傳，一般觀察仍認爲馬師未作離華的暗示，京未表示局勢已屬絕望。第三，正如聲明中所指出，政府和中共領袖實際上也都渴望和平。第四，國內經濟瀕於剻潰的趨勢，更逼得大家不能不尋求和平解決之路。第五，周恩來啊稱「局勢之嚴重實較聲明中所言者爲甚」，王炳南雖稱「問題重心在於和或戰」，但中共至今究還沒有敢公然說出以後只有「戰」，同時，蔣主席表示，只須停戰，整軍，恢復交通，共軍駐地四項主題切實解決，其他均可迎刃而解，可見和平之門並未全閉。第六，也是最重要的一點，有切膚之痛的中國人民至今實在還沒有對和平盡最大的努力，如果人民眞正能够提出獲致和平的具體辦法，誰敢一味執拗不從？所以，我們敢說：馬司聯合聲明以後的時局，嚴重則有之，絕望却未必，而極端悲觀則更用不着。此後，全看人民怎樣做法？</p>
<p>今天要打開這僵局，必須對馬司兩使所認爲難題的兩點，尋出一個合理的解決辦法。但在提具體辦法以前，首先須確立三項前提，就是：（甲）政府·中共·和調處者（不論盟友或自稱第三者的中國人）大家只許用理智，不許動感情，大家要爲人民生活着想，不可再爲黨派權利設想。（乙）大家必須互掬誠意，不能存心再拖，但尤其需要極大的忍耐力。孟子說：「有爲者譬如掘井；掘井而不及泉，猶爲棄井也」。今天爲中國謀和平的工作，春艱難已千萬倍於掘井，切望當事的雙方和調處者必須以「棄井」爲戒。我們還需要他們拿出更大的忍耐與毅力，來作切磋琢磨的功夫。（丙）大家必須共同認識，中國是中國人民的中國，不是國共兩黨瓜分或一黨獨佔的中國，故中國時局究當如何解決，最後只有取決於中國人民。政府和中共協商得好，固然好，否則他們各挾成見，相持不下，就得當仁不讓，由人民來下最後的決斷。故馬司調處到了今天的階段，趕快應該由中國人民起來支持他們，和他們合作來公斷這塲是非，誰也不許違背。聽說蔣主席將在本月下旬召集全國大學校長會談，我們以爲不妨擴而大之，怎樣可以讓那差不多可以代表全國人民意見的人物有一次會談，來表示他們對於解決時局的公意。現在，確乎病入膏肓，但眞能對症下藥，未始不能起死回一。</p>
<p>前提旣定，我們謹爲國家民族的生存和光榮設想，提供左列的建議：</p>
<p>（一）政府和中共先在最近幾天內向全國重申諾言：（一）停止一切宣傳戰，（二）絕對還政於民（政治民主化），還軍於國（軍隊國家化），（三）願意遵行軍隊的整編統編方案和切實恢復交通。這是確產此後商談的「誠信」基礎。</p>
<p>（二）政府公佈其軍隊重新部署的辦法，指定共軍移駐的地區範圍，和報告過去業已整編軍隊的實施程度；同時，共黨也可提供其重新部署的辦法，願意移駐的範圍，並報告其過去整編的實施程度。這是供給人民公斷可以依據的資料。</p>
<p>（三）以上兩項辦到後，政府應仿照最近中原地區停戰二十天的辦法成例，即日頒佈全國各地普遍停戰二十天或一個月的命令，同時由軍調部通飭各小組，立刻分赴各衝突地區，監督强制執行此停戰令。</p>
<p>（四）同時，政府即在首都或廬山召集一次比較可以代表全國性的會議或會談，並且邀情馬帥悚懼使原來調處的人和軍調部三位委員作爲觀察者，參加會議或會談的份子，應包括（一）國民黨的中央常務委員，（二）共產黨的中央常務委員，（三）青年黨的中央常務委員，（三）國家社會黨（已改名否，乃另一問題）的中央常務委員，（五）民主同盟的中央常務委員，（六）國民參政會的駇長，（八）各大學校長，（九）全國商會聯合會籌委會常務委員，（十）全國工業協會常務理事，（十一）全國各大報館（包括解放日報及新華日報）及通訊社（包括新華通訊社）的社長或總主筆，（十二）足以代表全國農工團體的常務理事，及其它足以代表宗教及社會團體的領袖，在這個會議裏可以准許新聞記者旁聽，政府和中共各掬誠陳述他們解決時局的具體辦法與理由，可毫隱議及整編統編軍隊方案，所以尙未切實執行的原故說出來，聽候大家平心靜氣的討論，再作公正合理的決定。不但永久停止衝突的辦法，就是如何切實裁編軍隊，如何改組政府擴大其民主基礎，如何依期召集國民大會，如何商定憲法要旨，均可在這個富有全國性意義的會議或會談裏作一決定。這眞是中國人大家相見以誠，一勞永逸的無上法門。</p>
<p>（五）廿六年秋的廬山會議，假使認爲是決定抗戰的會議；則如上所說的廬山會議，可以說是決定建國的會議。它對於中國的前途關係太重大了。共產黨如眞正愛國，當可參加這一會議。只要共黨能誠意參加，政府和中共都願聽取人民的意見，遵從人民的公斷，不但中國和平有絕對的把握，中國向着建國的大道邁進也可以有飛躍的奇蹟。我們至今認爲最大遺憾的，就是一年以來，政府和中典商談過程中，始終中俯得幾個黨派，而忽略了甚至遺忘了廣大的人民！殊不知今天不加入人民的力量，恐終無以解決中國的時局。那一方面如果拒絕參加這個會議或會談，或不遵從這會議或會談的決定，無異自絕於中國人民。人民就得判別是非曲直，來帮助遵從人民決議的一方，獲致中國的民主統一，不容再有任何勢力橫加阻撓與破壞。</p>
<p>讀者不要懷疑我們這個建議的迂緩難行；如果大家誠心實幹，兩個月內就可以解決中國大局，撥雲霧而見青天。我們想，馬司兩使目前也正深以束手無策爲苦，中國人民豈還能袖手旁觀，只管在豆棚瓜架之下嘆氣，或只說些似乎中立的風凉話？老實說吧，一年以來，中國時局所以如此之糟，國共兩方成見太深固爲一因，而若干「郷原」式的自稱「中立者」，也要負一部份責任。這些「中立者」不明「時中」的道理，尤其不知道權衝輕重權衡緩急權衡是厞由直的「權」之妙用，眞下犯了孟子所說，「執中無權，猶執一也；所惡執一者，爲其賊道也」的毛病，於是只曉得「我中立」，「我要不偏不倚」，而是非曲直一槪不聞不問了。他們以爲這樣才不致牽入是非漩渦，這樣才可憑了「中立」二字兩面討好，自己漫無主張，這不是「郷原」是什麼？孔子說過：「過我們而不入我室，我不憾焉者，其惟郷原乎？郷原，德之賊也！」孟子則更從而說明之，以爲他們「厞之，無舉也；刺之，無刺也；同乎流俗，合乎汚世；居之似忠信，行之似廉潔；衆皆悅之，自以爲是，而不可與入堯舜之道」。我們今天做中國人民，要站起來作一個判別是非曲直的國家主人，決不可以做一個兩面討好，「衆皆悅之」，郷原式的中立者。必須中國人民轉變這根本態度，中國時局始會有急轉直下，豁然開朗的一天！</p>

<h3 id="c49">力疾從公出席和會的英國巨人—貝文　是貝爾納斯的極大幫手　是莫洛托夫的冤家對頭 <a href="#c49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>在體格和意志上，貝文都是個巨人。他是不會在任何巨風之前低頭，不會被任何力量所左右的。假使有人以爲。他把蘇聯認爲是個平等的對手而不存任何敬提之心，並爲某些英國的國外政策作辯護，這就表示他已被右派勢力所影響了，這種人可說是完全未明白他的爲人和整個英國政治的背景。固然，在每次的外交會議上，他幾乎總是莫洛托夫的死對頭，因爲這兩個人都是直言無諱，不留情面的，貝文聲若洪鐘，口若懸河，他滔滔的雄辯，常使最會說話的莫洛托夫也束手無策。雖然如此，但這一點不能表示他是個右傾的思想者，英國在大選中，挑選了工黨，在這件事上所表顯的左傾態度，到目前止，可說是絲毫未曾改變。</p>
<p>無疑的，貝文的外交政策是他自己的，而且是從他不變的左翼觀點出發的。這，有些人也許會覺得不懂，不單是外國人，就是英國人也如此。但我們只要一明瞭了英國左翼發展的背景，那就會覺得，這原是很自然的事了。</p>
<p>這個背景可分爲兩部分，一方面是無產階級的工運，源起於各產業工會，其中兩位同樣重要的領袖人物是貝文和摩里遜。這批人信奉法國革命時的口號「自由，平等，博愛，」也就是北美獨立宣言中所謂的「生存，自由，與幸福的追求。」他們希望每個人都能自由說話，其才能優點應受尊重，不論他出身的高低，並且，在他自己勞力所創造的財產中，應該分享其應得的一分。</p>
<p>這批人自上次大戰以來就是和共產黨不對的，這有三種理由：一，共產黨曾一直想在政治和工會方面分裂左翼，以致使他們浪費了不少的時間，精力，和金錢。二，共產主義在理論上和在蘇聯的實踐上，都是反對自由工會主義的，而且他們要把這一派的左翼消滅，比要消滅任何右翼的集團都更積極：第三，也許也是最深刻的一點，就是從貧苦裏長大起來的人們害怕任何樣式的無保障，所以寗願要溫和的改革，而不要共產黨所想望的革命。所以，溢一支的工運一向來都是批評蘇聯的，貝文和維辛斯基的針鋒相對，也就是如此。</p>
<p>另一部分可以說是有產階級的工運，其中最主要的是克里浦斯爵士，一個地主階級的貴族後裔，這個運動是由他的姑母比埃屈麗斯，魏勃（即魏勃爵士夫人）所創立的，魏勃夫婦與幾個朋友組織了一個社會改革協會，會員主要的是中產階級份子。這些人並不要求什麽「生存，自由，與幸福的追求」，因爲這些他們本已有了。他們乃是些秩序思想的人，並有　某種程度的雄心，想一舉而消滅無秩序，並改革英國的社會機構，使它們能與工業革命以來的變遷相和諧，並把它造成一種嚴格的計劃經濟。</p>
<p>這種想想受我們最高的尊祟，因爲遺種和諧運動的確是十分必要的。魏勃大婦和他們的一群也是虔誠而能幹的人，在蘇聯身上，他們看見了自己這種理想的實現，同時他們也很高興，布爾雪維克所做的結果能頗爲滿意，並使政府的執政者得到了改革的　　　　共產黨的活動並未曾　　了他們的工運組織，而且他們自己生活上也從無這種無保障的經騐，會使他們對革命　怕，所以他們對於蘇聯向來是全力支持的。現在如此，將來大概也然。</p>
<p>誰要是以爲，貝文在和莫洛托夫打交道以前，必已放棄了自己早先的思想，這種人，要就是不明白英國左翼這兩種背景的分化，要就是已把貝文　納在另一邊了。</p>
<p>貝文的態度是莊重，嚴肅的，有着一種泱泱的正人風度。他從不尋找藉口，原諒自己，他只直截了當地把問題一一對付。而在聯合國機構中，他也解決了那一切問題之根本的問題。我有一次問一個美國的新聞記者，「你對於聯合國機構的印象如何？」他回答說：「我最深刻的一點印象，就是，一切都是在台上進行，不必去探訪什麽幕後的秘密活動，」靠了貝文在聯合國首次大會中所表顯的那種單刀直入的坦白態度，他已把德黑蘭和雅爾達會議時代卑鄙的秘密外交，一脚踢到了九霄雲外，這就是貝文待人處事的風度。</p>

<p>〔本報辦〕八一四空軍節即將到來，中國航空建設協會，空軍總司令部等機關昨特聯合在虹橋機塲舉行飛機模型比賽。昨晨九時許，荒蕪已久遍地野草之虹橋機塲上，觀衆雲集，約近千人。參加比賽者，多係各大中小學學生，凡二百卅餘人。飛行比賽計分七類：（一）彈射式滑翔模型，參加者九人。（二）手擲式滑翔模型，參加者十三人。（三）桿身牽引滑翔模型，參加者十三人。（四）艙身牽引滑翔模型，參加者廿五人。（五）桿身橡筋動力模型，參加者八十九人。（六）艙身橡筋動力模型，參加者六十九人。（七）汽油動力模型，參加者七人。</p>
<p>每類比賽時分由紅·靑·白·黃四組同時舉行。每組想隔三丈餘，各樹彩旗一面，以爲標幟，有裁判四五人分任計時等工作。比賽以飛行時間爲標準，而定該模型之設計及性能之優劣。賽前對各該模型，並有極嚴格之檢定，由交大航空工業系畢業同學分任檢定員，分別測量，以求合乎國際規定。十時許，此賽開始，參加之靑年俱高舉手製之模型次第起飛一時藍天白雲，紙鳥縱橫，蔚爲奇觀，參加比賽之模型飛機幾完全爲紙質木桿製成，全部木質機身者殊不多覯紙質身輕，且昨日風速約在每小時十二哩左右，故模型機昇空後多飄忽不能目主，其中以桿身牽引式爲最可觀，由一牽引索曳引，逆風上昇達高度五十餘呎後，即放脫牽綫，模型機即隨風盤旋下降，滑翔極遠。聞前在重慶比賽時，滑翔最高紀錄爲四十餘分鐘。據昨會中總裁判長交大航工系敎授楊彭基談稱：由於上海材料較內地優良，設計優秀，上項全國紀錄或可望打破，至詳確紀錄及各類優勝名次與成績，須俟今明計算後方能公布。昨全部競賽至下午五時結束。</p>

<h3 id="c113">目前我國工業衰落之主因 <a href="#c113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>— 章柏菴</p>
<p>在這我國政治·經濟，愈趨繁複的現在，國內工商業普遍的衰落了！國內輿論，曾紛紛提出意見，作緊急之呼籲，但是這衰落的趨向將每況愈下，當在意料中。</p>
<p>工業爲國家之命脈，無工業即無國家，試觀這次世界大戰，與其說是人類的自相殘殺，母寗說是工業的競賽，盟國苟無美國之高度工業做後盾，則戰爭的勝負，誰也不能斷定！軸心國恃其強大之工業，不惜與世界爲敵；但是競賽到了盡頭，不能有一分一毫之差。我國工業，與世界列强一比，真可說是「無工業」的國家，唯其組織脆弱，所以在經濟狂瀾之中，不堪一擊，目前我國工業之苦悶，與夫不能生存之主因，一爲工業資金來源之缺乏，二爲成品之不能與外貨競爭，三爲製造成本之高昂；有此三種原因，造成了工業傾頹的今日。</p>
<p>何以工業資金來源會缺乏呢？在幣値未穩定以前，高利貸不曾歛跡以前，我敢說工業資金來源永不會有，工業是各種事業投資中最滯鈍的一種投資，工業生產，又不似商業運銷之能靈活運用，它的成功，不是一年半載所能看得出成績來，戰前我國有幾家工廠，竟有做了十年，還賺不到一個錢，而且反而折本的也有，可是這種作風，却造成了它强固的基礎，即使受到外來的波動，它始終是屹立未動，所以處於高利貸及暴利主義的現在，你想還有這樣的傻子來投資工業嗎？這是一。</p>
<p>如果你要金融業拿出錢來投資於工廠，這也有點近於單相思，金融業本身究有多少能力，調出這大批流動資金來作呆滯欠款，也是一個大大的疑問；這是二。</p>
<p>工業投資，老實說是依靠民間，現在我國工業條件，誠如劉攻芸所說：是十九世紀的工業，勢必全部淘汰，現在國人個個人都曉得辦工業是緊要，而人人都知道工業前途可決定其失敗？所以民間資本，決不能導入工業投資，這是三。</p>
<p>其次我們要談到國貨不能與外貨競爭問題，每一工業製品，第一，必須要競爭，而且不由你不競爭，競爭的結果，當然是優勝劣敗，此爲必然之理</p>
<p>第二，製品必須要符合「購買力」，同一品質，同一貨品，甲廠賣一萬，乙廠賣二萬，前者就是適合「購買力」；何況當前外貨祇是「推銷」，還不能說「傾銷」的時候，中國工業就大聲疾呼地求救，將來一旦眞個「傾銷」起來，不知用何方法可以抵禦？總之，有了外貨，就不能不競爭，自身若沒有競爭能力，結果唯有沒落。</p>
<p>再次製造成本之高昂，是事實，但這不是一成不變的，世界各國，工業製造成本，只有日見其减，不似我國之日增月盛，其原因由於我國工業「人力」的浪費，「動力」的不利用所致，人家運輸原料，以至於產品之製成，「人力」所佔極微，目前我國一種產品之製成，幾全部皆須「人力」，當此「工資」高漲超過任何物價之時，「人力」與「動力」之運用，其相去不可以道里計，所以欲謀工業之生存，必須儘量　除「人力」，而取「動力」，這是减低生產成本唯一的條件；此外在農業基礎尚未奠定的現在，工業生產是無法减低其成本的，因爲農業生產低落，即是工業生產原料之提高，製成之品，決不能符合當前的「購買力」。</p>
<p>依上所論，我國的工業問題，國家應該有一個統盤的籌劃，沒有計劃性的工業，雖有心人能依其「人爲」的努力，恐怕也是枉然。</p>
<p>去年四月間，美國對外經濟處，曾對我國擬就了計劃工業的方案，內中包括了六〇四種工業，以及全國地區之分佈，完全依照現代工業生產條件來擬定的，但是全案文長二千多頁，我們只看到了一個提要，最好請政府發表其全文，給中國工業家研究研究，免得人家，走頭無路，莫知所從！</p>
<p>最後，我們還得說一句，八年抗戰，人力財力物力都是取給於農村，原氣斷喪，貧血症已經到了極點，購買力已降至零度，所以目前一切工商業的衰落以至於總崩潰，即是證明中國農村已經埀死了，希望談中國工業建設者，多多注意這一點。</p>

<h3 id="c114">新竹：臺灣的健康地帶 <a href="#c114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>— 本報三日臺灣航訊　特派員江暮雲</p>
<p>在台灣，醫學家和衛生家們認爲最標準的稀有的健康地帶，就是新竹，這個健康地帶的蘊蓄是基於合理的地理形勢，東南北三面環山，西面臨海峽，而且是本　的最凸出部份，從市區到海邊，僅有八華里，經常保持着攝氏二十一度四的溫度，最易感受的季節風，在這裏是相當强烈的，所以臺灣「竹風蘭雨」，新竹的風和宜蘭的雨，都是天時給予本省兩個地方的特點，因爲多風，從空氣裏散佈的疫菌，不易在此一地區停留的，而將新竹凈化了。</p>
<p>在台南交通綫上，新竹有如江蘇的蘇州，它是從台北到台南去經過的第一個大站，街通是寛敞的柏油路，整齊的行道樹，店舖，日本人時代就稱之為威容，這現代化的都市的情調以蘇州來比擬，怕有着一個時代的距離罷！生息在這裏的人們，他們清晰地記憶起，只不過二百三十五年前的事，一百多個福建人冒海飄到了竹塹港（現在的舊港），他們以集體的力量，將盤踞着的蕃族驅逐了，這塊荒地，就是現在台灣五大都市之一的原始的新竹市。</p>
<p>這地區應當是健康的，但並不新竹的老百姓受虐病和性病的纏擾，非常厲害，最近因為發現鼠疫，又不得不事先普遍地展開防疫運動。</p>
<h3 id="c115">市府天天鬧窮 <a href="#c115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>新竹和其他都市遭遇着同一的命運，因為有着規模較大的飛機塲，百分之四十以上，被炸毀了，尤其是市區東部，受炸最烈，原有的商業區毀了，被迫着移到西方來，可是因為西門市場容納有限，一種塞滿街頭的擠軋情形，仍留着戰時景色。市府原控制九個區，經重新劃編為東·南·西·北·香山·竹東·寳山等七區，合併以後，原有五萬六千人的人口數增加到超過十一萬七千人。為了竹東是工業區，有生產，有礦產，在重劃界限時，曾惹起了縣和市熱烈的爭執，結果是市府勝利了！</p>
<p>郭紹宗市長，是光復後來台的接收人員，他吿訴記者說：被炸後道路橋樑陰溝渡板的整理，預定本年底完成，水道工程，八月終完成，瓦斯的修補和洩氣處的塡塞工作，也在進行中。</p>
<p>市區內敎育相當發達，有十五所國民學校，二三一級，一萬多就學兒童，一所市立中學，四所省中，包括商業·工業·女中和普通中學。各市立學校普遍的流行病，是欠薪。市長坦誠地說—萬樣計劃，沒有錢要實踐，是不可能的。市府金庫，天天閙窮，卅五年度四千六百萬的預算，到現在還沒批下來，自七月十五日開始征稅，可是要到新穀登場八月以後才有辦法，這個靑黃不　時期，正不僅是新竹市，而是全省風行行的貧血症。</p>
<p>財政政策確定了沒有，人們都在問，但回聲是沒有的。</p>
<h3 id="c116">工業都市計劃 <a href="#c116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>依照市府的計劃，新竹市可能一躍而為現代化的工業都市。它具備的條件是有天然資源，交通便利，多數工廠中在一起，尤其是新竹市的生命綫的竹東，經過寶山礦區，相距十七公里，那裏出和　和美國西部加州Kettleman所產原油品質不相上下的大然瓦斯，（全島可產原油礦井有三十個，年產二萬三千四百桶，全島有一百以上的天然瓦斯井，幾乎全部在本島的西部）。石灰石·硅砂·等，而煤的藏量更豐富，且為全島最優良的焦煤，所以煉鋼鐵。更有年產十萬噸的南方水泥工廠，及山地所產的木材。日本人在三十三年十二月以台幣四百五十五萬元的總工費，開始在這里建築鐵路，預計一年四月完成，於是戰時經濟的萎縮，使他們只完成了百分之四十。去年，市府擬定了完成這條鐵路的計劃，預算需費七百八十九萬元，因為遲遲未批示，到今年物價高漲，不得不增加到二千九百萬元，最近才吿核准。這個無形中增加的損失，應該誰負是明顯的。當局的多慮固是必要，但物價却背棄了政府法律的約束；結果把國家的損失，全部付給了時間。</p>
<h3 id="c117">建築產業鐵路 <a href="#c117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>從新竹到竹東的產業鐵路，現在利用旣存的鐵軌和枕木，即日開工，要是沒有意外的話，半年內可以運用舊機關車裝貨搭客。郭市長說，這條路以竹東為終點，也將成為產業的中心地帶。</p>
<p>照確切的估計，將來可以從產區搬出一萬多噸的木材，五千餘噸（MT）的薪湠，七千噸的米，四十萬噸以上的竹林，五千噸以上的果實，以「加納牌」煤礦為中心地點搬運的煤，年產四十萬噸的石灰石以及硅砂和纖維，這些產品由旣存的帝國汽油公司，加納牌煤礦鹽野化工股份公司，植松製材工場，南方水泥股份公司供給和產掘。</p>
<p>天然瓦斯研究所的六十萬伏特的變壓機被炸毀了，還在停着工；鹽野化工廠是以市內所產的柑橋及其他為原料，製造香油運銷省外的工場。植松目前的製材能力，僅十萬石，將來要是能開發鹿場大山等處，在竹東却需要年產二十石的製材設備。</p>
<h3 id="c118">小規模現代港 <a href="#c118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>新竹工業都市的致命傷，是沒有出口貿易港，市政當局計劃者濱海的南　（舊港）築一個小規模的現代港，本島內陸的頭前溪，風山溪諸水，由這裏流注入海。這裏到福州一百三十餘里，到廈門僅百六十里，較基隆近七十里，台灣沿海岸綫距閩省沿岸，以新竹為最近，日本人在這裏關為商業港，因爲港口淤積，加以海風猛烈，港內又沒有設備，所以目前從福州開來的船隻，每月平均只有二十七八艘，進口貨在十噸左右。要是這條港能復築，船隻進出，不受水淺和風大影響，預計吞吐的噸數，月可增加數十倍到數百倍，同時可以將盛產虱目魚，　的水產業發達起來。</p>
<p>舊港港口預定闊三〇公尺，港內闊一〇〇公尺，全長二五〇公尺，並建築碼頭和護岸。港內最大退潮位二公尺以下，東邊岸壁二五〇公尺，作為漁塲貯存漁類，背面建設有關漁港設備備的陸上建築，西南邊岸壁二五〇公尺作為商港，背面為倉庫及商店。要防止頭前溪洪水及高潮時的衝擊，再築洪水防禦堤，這樣可以收容三〇噸以下機器漁船七〇艘，一〇〇噸級以下的輪船二〇艘，帆船三〇艘，共一二〇艘。、初市長說，工業化現代化的新竹市有可能完成了，現在更需要完成名符其實的健康都市。</p>
<h3 id="c119">徐州之聲 <a href="#c119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>— 四日徐州訊　郭劍農</p>
<p>九年闊別，一旦歸來，筆者眼看到今日的徐州，覺得是一切都已改觀了。當筆者復員歸來踏入徐市的第一步，首先映人眼簾的，便是寛闊的馬路，高大的洋房，縱橫兩條幹綫貫通徐市，比較京市的馬路還要寛三分之一。敵寇踞徐時，　徐州於華北六大都市之列，用偽維新政府的經濟力量來從事建設，後來改為華中特別區，北款不能接濟，更停止了，所以全市建設尚未完成。收復以後，以外圍共軍的滋擾，未脫軍事狀態，自然無暇及此。縣參議會雖有建設委員會的組織，可是方在設計，目前自難實現，而接收時物資的損失，也無形中减少建設的力量，不禁令人惋惜！</p>
<p>新都市新建築難民羣的蓆棚</p>
<p>同時，在社會的一角，所反映的是新都市的新建築：難民的蓆棚·城東津浦沿綫，城南雲龍山東附近一帶，棚戶櫛比，都是用蘆蓆搭蓋，略如行軍的帳篷。孺婦集居，席地打舖，一遇陰雨，上漏下濕，泥水沒踝，雖救濟會及地方人士極力救濟，也感粥少儈多。記得當筆者過鎭時；和民政廳長王公與氏談及徐市建設；王氏喟然的說，橫在目前的一件難事，便是救濟問題。這眞是一個嚴重的問題。就徐市附近的難民計，已不下十餘萬，鄕村更是比戶流離。富戶成了難民，貧家全充了苦力，流氓地痞才是「解放區」的中心幹部。筆者歷經川，湘，鄂，赣，皖，沿途尚未覩此浩刦，「誰實為之，孰令致之」？對於這些造孽的份子，筆者不免疾首。</p>
<p>刧案要犯伏法產權清而未清</p>
<p>徐市社會，目下尚不能稱為安定。數月前晚上街市中，竟有刦案的發生，聽說兇犯是某署的關係人，破案後逃不過事實，已經伏法了。近兩三月來，已沒有這種情形，這可算是好的現象，不過人民最感痛苦的，便是產權的淸理。聽說已經有過五六次的登記和調查，各種手續都做遍了、最近蘇浙皖敵偽財產處理局駐蘇辦事處，徐州分處，又經加封，執行假扣押。最近商農工敎育婦女各會理事長，聯函該處，在徐報公開質問三項：（一）人民私有房產，經敵僞佔用或改建，其私人產權業經市政府或公私產權淸理委員會處理淸結，幷領有管業執照，何以貴處來徐後又予加封？市府及淸理會前此之處理，是否合法？（二）加封後之房屋名為假扣押，乃假扣押之後，何以更有再度加封情事？（三）人民財產旣經依法辦理淸理手續，確定產權，政府即應依法予以保障，長此假扣押或再加封，最後究將如何處理？此一筆流水帳已夠清算，而更有部隊駐紥軍　佔住機關留用者，人民要求復業不得，千頭萬緒，五花八門，不知將如何解決？</p>
<p>組武裝還鄉團　難民隨軍推進</p>
<p>軍事的開展是目前徐州最好的現象，各縣難民組織武裝還鄕團，隨軍事推進。徐西已收復蕭縣城，徐東收復雙溝，四圍均有開展，惟朧海東路被共軍破壞太甚，白塔埠至阿湖東閘口鐵道全毀，運河橋孔端炸壞，砲車趙墩間路基被挖，路局正隨軍搶修。最近據報趙墩以北，共軍集結萬人，西路嚴黃段以南，發現便衣隊，雙溝迤南亦增援萬人據說國軍擬先肅淸隴海將綫南，進掃當在高梁砍伐之後，但水火中的人民都願早日脫離地獄生活，盼望及早的掃蕩肅淸。</p>
<p>徐市的敎育，可說相當的發達，現有國立一校，（國師）省立四校，（江蘇學院，徐中，徐師，徐女師，）市立中學一校，（市中），縣立中學一校，（縣中），私立中學七校，（昕昕，培正，鼎銘，九一八，子揚，大彭，雲龍，）小學方面，各鎭均有中心學校，學生人數各中學多為卞餘班，中心學校有達三十班者。市區擴展，人口增加，學生數額自亦加多。現在各校正在招生，投考的學生確實不少，而對於復員的學生，教廳遠沒有明令安置，這却令人感覺手續緩而未週了。</p>
<p>物質建設有待精神建設加緊</p>
<p>最後，談談徐州的輿論。戰前各報復刊的，祇徐報一家，民報雖亦復刊，以印刷的艱難又停止了，新徐的機器，鉛字，被敵偽掠去，接收時不知移轉何處，以致未能恢復。新添的有正義中報兩家，持論均平妥，但對於地方的批評似還嫌少，或者是時效與環境所使然。記得筆者過鎭時，與地方在省人士談及徐州文化建設，省參議會秘書長劉虛舟氏，曾有樹立地方中心輿論的呼聲。真的新徐州是需要如何的建設，物質的目前或者有待，精神的實在刻不容緩！</p>

<p>— 本報歸綏通訊員　劉映元</p>
<p>各旗情況綜合報道</p>
<p>自從抗日蒙旗慶祝勝利還都晋京代表團離開歸綏以後，緩蒙十八旗近况甚為沉寂。蒙旗人士在歸綏集中之舍利圖召，亦較前冷落許多。最近，烏蘭察布盟，除共軍收編僞蒙軍烏力吉勒部與綏遠保安師鄂友三部在察綏邊境衝突數次外，其它地方尚稱安靜。惟某方便衣武裝人員在百靈廟附近潛伏工作，已使四子王旗扎薩克索那穆綽克珠爾，不敢在王府居住，日前秘密返旗週餘，又匆匆折回歸綏。</p>
<p>烏拉特三旗以西公旗多事，女王倚俊峯近將包頭縣屬數保漢民編入旗府，擅自印行人民符號。中灘一帶地主為謀自衛，積極購置槍校，組織地方保衛團隊。伊克昭盟七旗中郡王旗西協理奇全禧代表圖王在包頭忙於接收僞伊克昭盟公署，達拉特旗西協理汪鵬程，因殺害漢人王三捷案尚未出獄，烏審旗護理扎薩克奇玉山偕領小王奇世英晋謁傳長官後返旗鄂托克旗保安司令奇思誠來綏，月餘仍不見歸去。抗錦旗與扎薩克旗，在阿王及鄂貝子此兩位舊式王公領導下，猶如不起波紋之死水一樣。</p>
<p>準格爾旗政務一斑</p>
<p>準格爾旗自獨裁者奇文英被刺後，因扎薩克奇治國夭亡無後，近成立類似聯合政府之善後整理委員會，主持政務，委員七人中，包括各派份子，並有漢人一人担任委員，頃尚相安無事、將來如何，誰也不敢憚證。土默特旗靑年往集寗尋求新刺激者，已經絕跡，據掃興而返者表示：「解放區」好進難出。東四旗皆在共軍掌握之下，淸算政策將許多人逼來　綏，蒙古難民由省府從優救濟，渠等因懷念農田牧場，亦發出武裝還鄉之呼籲。上月二十日下午八時，傅長官在大雨中召集有關機關首長，舉行臨時蒙務會議，聞討論主題為扶植蒙旗與安定蒙旗，並研究治蒙方案，不久或將對此公佈文吿云。</p>
<p>綏西七縣田禾被淹</p>
<p>近年西北各地人口增多，甘靑寗綏之造林運動普遍展開。故沙漠氣候逐漸好轉，冬季已不若戰前酷寒，夏季雨量亦比住年充沛。頃據綏遠水利局接獲薩拉齊以西各水文站電報，黃河水位在「伏水」期間增高二〇，二公尺，已使河套各渠汎濫，包頭附近磴口黃河出岸，距離鐵路不及四丈。截至目前為止，綏西七縣被流田禾，已達十萬餘畝，聞秋水到來，形勢更將猖獗。三十二年夏末秋初之際，黃河曾在河套出岸，幸駐軍協助人民防堵，未釀巨災。抗戰勝利後，河套七萬軍隊大部東調，壯丁多加入部隊離鄉。</p>
<p>守軍出動與水挑戰</p>
<p>現河套黨政人員，正率領老弱婦孺，日夜防堵。入晚各渠佈滿紅綠燈籠，傳長官已令留駐河套之×師防守部隊，一律出動，與水作戰。最近夏禾已經登塲，如上游水位續漲，秋禾可能有十分之七八，被溢水腐亂。又上月十一日塞北濃雲密佈，一直落雨九天，至二十一日始行放晴，未及登塲之夏禾，多在雨水中發霉，鄕民居住之黃土房屋，十分之二三慘雨水淋倒，並有壓死打傷之被事。平緩路西段橋樑，被山洪冲毀多處，已使行車緩慢。綏蒙各旗之牲畜，因土地潮濕，牛羊患疥瘡者甚多。省府每日收到之災情報告，有如雪片飛來，已呈請中央速撥賑款，以解救痛受天災禍雙重壓迫之邊民。</p>

<p>讓孩子們讀書</p>
<p>編者先生：勝利以後，上海的市政正在力謀改進，但是因為市庫支絀，有許多地方不能符合市民仰望之高，尤其是敎育問題，已經到了非常嚴重的階段，在敵偽時期，市民不願意子弟去受奴化敎育，甚至已經荒費了幾年可貴的求學年齡；有的剛從大後方回來；如今要送子弟去讀書，却沒有地方送了。一般學校，尤其是市立小學，大都不公開招生，送子弟上學，竟然和謀事一樣的困難。</p>
<p>虹口某市立小學，原有十二敎室，此次會舉行一次招考，結果報名的人達一千七百餘人，倘然連原有的舊生統計在內，這些學生要開辦到五十教育，才能容納得下。</p>
<p>按理說，小學是國民敎育，國民有讀完小學敎育的義務，也可以說是納稅市民的一種權利，他們有權要求政府給予他們的子弟有一個受小學敎育的機會；學校當局對於要來學的學生，不論其程度怎樣，不論有多少人，祇能在錄收的年級上分別高低，不能說拒絕不收。</p>
<p>但是，因為教育經費的沒有辦法，所以我們覺得敎育問題已經到了非常　　的階段。</p>
<p>可是，　　　　　　　了嗎？</p>
<p>像上面舉例的幾個小學，當然是有其殊的原因，因為　　　區原來都是住的日僑，目前日僑　　以後，人口正在高速的增加、而且，那一區裏一共只有二個市立小學，尤其是別的湘區小學不招生，也是促成該小學會考人數激增的一種重要原因。這些都是特殊的因素，祇有二種方法可以解決，或是在這區裏另外開辦幾個小學，或是讓這個小學利用其原有的校舍空地儘量供給校具，儘量擴充班次，一面全面的使各校擴充疏散，才可以得到解決，否則將使許多學齡兒童，無處入學。</p>
<p>一般情形，因為市府經費支絀，對於敎育事業，根本沒有辦法供給擴展的費用；又恐怕市民增加負担，不讓學校自行籌募，因此使得各級學校的主管人員，都不敢作擴展的計劃。對於私立學校，又管　得很嚴，　熱心教育的人，也不敢作創業的嘗試。</p>
<p>對於這種現實，要謀問題的解决，我們不敢作太高的論調，譬如說，要熱心教育的人士自動捐學啦，要各校主管人員明白敎育的重要，不要斤斤於經費問題啦，老實說，在這個社會，今日經濟狀况之下，沒有一個切當的辦法，誰也沒有力量來獨自解決這個龐大的問題；而，要教育事業獨自清高，，不從經費問題去謀解決，結果，適足以置教育事業於死地。</p>
<p>我們認為有幾辦法，或許可以解決這個嚴重的問題：</p>
<p>（一）市立學校如果還有擴展的餘地，應該儘量幫助他擴展，倘使設備費用無法供給，可以准許向學生家長徵募，經常費用則仍舊由市府供給，這樣，照目前情形而論，各家長的負担一學期也不過多二三萬元，雖然及不上　　教育，較諸拒之門外，似乎略勝一籌，而目前許多家長，也願意這樣辦，只要子弟有書讀。</p>
<p>（二）由市政府呈請行政院令飭　聯總處低息供給敎育事業貸款，不論市立，私立；不論初創或是蕉有的學校，經敎育局認為確實有擴展的必要，可以有市政府担保，敎育局嚴密管理，向四聯各行借款創設，或是擴展，這貸款在市立學校，俟市府經費轉機時撥還，在私立學校分數學期陸續歸還。</p>
<p>（三）市政府對於各地區敵偽房屋的分配，要多多着重於敎育事業，也不要太着重於大學校舍，尤其是敵僑地區要格外留置中小學的校舍。</p>
<p>（四）與其撥款辦失學的救濟，不如用這筆款子搶救目前正要失去求學年齡的兒童。</p>
<p>總之，不能讓孩子沒有書讀；在沒有辦法當中要想點辦法。　（丁立凡）</p>

<h3 id="c122">麻省春田城舉行美對華政策廣播辯論的一幕 <a href="#c122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>— 七月卅一日航訊　維藩寄自紐約</p>
<p>不論如何，吾人加諸中國中央政府之援助，當非用以引起內戰者。目前以及將來吾人所作之各種努力，乃促成統一之中國。</p>
<p>（美國務院遠東司司長范宣德）</p>
<p>最近安平事件發生後，美國左派衆議員德勒大唱「美軍應即自華撤退，並停止援華」之論調，一般人並不驚奇，因彼久已蓄此意見。茲值值爲國人報告者，即五六月間，猶在東北停戰令未下之前，美國麻省春田城曾舉行一次美國對華政策之廣播辯論。參加者，除德勒塞外，有衆議員楚德及國務院遠東司司長范宣德。從該次辯論中，可窺見美國朝野態度之一斑。范宣德稱：美國致力協助中國和平統一，乃係現實政策。楚德衆議員則謂中國東北情勢現極複雜，可能危及世界和平，如能經各方同意，可由聯合國暫時代管中國東北，直至中國國內眞獲統一時爲止。一次大戰發生於中國東北，該區今又爲危險之火藥庫二德勒塞之發言，反映左翼份子意見，重彈共產黨人慣發之攻擊老調。彼指責中國政府未能遵守成立聯合政府之協定。楚德與德勒塞二人，對中國東北目前危急情勢之導因，各持己見，不肯相下。楚德認爲中國之騷亂，應山共產黨之策劃活動負其主要責任，德勒塞則謂中國中央政府未能遵行規定，然彼等均認自美國安全及世界和平觀點而言，中國統一實屬需要，馬歇爾元帥在此方面之努力，應獲信任與支持。范宣德綜述國務院之意見，以爲美國致力協助中國獲致和平及統一，並非利已行爲，此乃促進國際利益。蓋由於中國之未能團結一致，日本始能於一九三一年發動其侵略，美國於一九四一年參預全面戰爭，亦由此直接促成。楚德衆議員正確指陳：吾人必需支持中國獨立，與領土及主權之完整，然吾人不能再完全寄賴於自我約束之門戶開放及九國公約原則，吾人必需積極努力以促成强大統一中國之出現。今日之問題，並非吾人之努力，是否可於短期間內促成中國完善無缺之統一，乃吾人於面臨明顯困難之際，能否容許放棄此促成中國統一之努力，或改變努力之方向。馬歇爾元帥所提之政策，乃藉和平方法促成中國之統一。逾越此項政策之共他途徑，自余（楚德自稱）觀之乃係全面支持中國政府，冀藉武力達成統一。然此有造成下列令人不悅事實之可能性，即中國將分裂爲兩大敵對陣營，遠東方面任何建設性之政策，因此將遭受嚴重影響。范氏作結論時聲稱：「余深感吾人於避免牽入中國黨派政治之時，應繼續予馬歇爾元帥以信任及支持，助其執行其所肩負關係美國中國及國際和平長久利益之重大任務。」在此次廣播辯論中，最可注意者，爲國務院遠東司司長范宣德之態度。據稱：美國務院蒐集各報意見加以檢討後，深信美國各方而對於杜魯門總統對華政策之聲明，幾全加擁護，對於馬歇爾元帥處理「棘手」之中國問題之方法，亦咸表贊許。有詢以設或蘇聯支持共黨而美國支持中央政府，中國求獲國內統一之機會是否遭遇破壞？范氏答謂：遭遇破壞，猶其小事耳。唯吾人之政策，乃與中國中央政府爲謀，蓋中央政府乃各方共認之中國政府，且不獨吾人僅援助中國中央政府者，蘇聯官方政策亦然。此可自去歲八月中央政府與蘇聯所訂之同盟條約見之。然不論如何，吾人加諸中國中央政府之援助，當非用以引起內戰者。目前以及將來吾人所作之各種努力，乃促成統一之中國。吾人決不希望中國之情勢受兩方面之外在力量所牽　。職是之故，國務卿貝爾納斯於去歲十二月莫斯科外長會議中握住是項概念，乃與蘇外長莫洛托夫及英外長貝文，成立協議，發表宣言，謂「中國必須在國民政府下成爲一統一民主之中國，由各民主份子得廣泛參與國民政府谷部門，並停止國內衝突。」范氏繼謂：「中國國民政府目別急務，乃鰲訂農業改革計劃，以改善人民生活，俾能證明其政府確爲人民而治。」記者認爲范宣德司長之言論，爲我國內朝野人士所應重視。今後美國對華政策如經檢討，究將如何演變，恐仍亦不能此範圍。</p>
<h3 id="c123">長春的熱浪 <a href="#c123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>— 本報二日瀋陽航訊　特派員韓清濤寄</p>
<p>熱流吹到了長春，長春在暑氣蒸人了！　長春中山路（前稱中央通）上，大樹蔭蔽街道，遮住了火箭般的陽光，給行人很大的恩惠，幾個大廣塲，和沒有樹木的幾條街道，閃露着靑天，把人晒得火辣辣的，街道雖然如此，室內則凉風習習，到了晚間更凉爽，有時還感到有些冷意。</p>
<p>一般人的衣着，還多是白藍布，灤色的中山裝和西服，也不覺得怎麽樣的寒酸，因爲陰了天和早晚是很凉的，紅布的短衫褲還受婦女和小姑娘的愛好，靑布也是家常的衣服，尤其是下衣。</p>
<p>除了高樓大厦外，城區的居民還多住着低倭的房子裏，所幸的晚間凉爽，不太悶熱，蚊蟲也不多，睡起來是很舒服的，到了晚間，街上很少行人，早睡早起的習慣，在這裏還保持着。</p>
<p>車馬多生意好</p>
<p>大的建築物，雖然有些破壞了，也有些彈痕累累，瘡疤尚未平復，但一般的說起來，大多數還稱得上完整，這比瀋陽要好得多了。</p>
<p>電車行駛的輛數，還可免强應付市民的需要，到城裏的大馬路上，一片得得的馬蹄聲；在中山大街上，也是一運串的車輪軋地聲，車價五元起碼，電車則一律五元？</p>
<p>城裏火馬路上的幾家大商塲和開店，生意還不惡，一般的日用品，可以說是應有盡有，早晨開門時間多在八九點鐘，午後七點就要關門了。</p>
<p>五馬路上，街道兩旁，儘是小販呌賣日本雜亂的物品，他們以廉價收進來，高價賣出去，轉手間得到了很多好處，所以多在做這樣的生意，有類上海虹口虬江路的情景。</p>
<p>未走的日本人</p>
<p>長春的日僑開始撤退了，南站的十多個鐵棚子裏，都住着準備登車的日本男女僑民，某餘也正在作歸計，據調查長春日僑俘共計二十三萬人，現已撤去五萬餘人。</p>
<p>南起「永樂町」北運「吉野町」的馬路上，十之八九是日本僑民出賣衣物的所在，這和瀋陽的「春日町」和「靑葉町」幾乎是完全一樣的，瀋陽以「春日町」做中心，長春以「吉野町」爲重心，遼長的街道，裏面也參雜着我們的同胞，在裏做買賣。</p>
<p>瀋陽禁舞了，長春舞塲仍舊存在，樂隊的美妙音樂，經廣播器送到了室外，裏面則有好多人和日本舞女跳着「崩喳崩」的步子，舞票流通券五元一張，坐台子半點鐘一百元，「芷江」舞廳就是其中一個，不過軍人不受招待，如果進去了，會有人拍拍肩膀，把他勸出來。</p>
<p>十四和十五日的下午，長春日僑俘集合了他們優秀的歌手和舞家，在中山紀念堂開會慰勞國軍，音業，燈光，舞蹈，歌聲，眞是都很够味，在唱我國流行歌曲中，有「何日君再來」「薔薇處處開」，唱的日本姑娘，着鮮艷適體的旗袍，歌着華語美好的詞句，表情，輕舞，使我們的弟兄，熱情奔放，掌聲連天，這種笑臉和聲響，十個月來曾經捧獻過了不同的人物。</p>
<p>宣傳事業躍進</p>
<p>新聞界在長春以競賽的姿態出了版，到了現在，計有「中央日報」「前進日報」「新生日報」「華聲日報」「吉林日報」「湘潮日報」「建設日報」「東北民報」「民聲晟報」等九家，另有日文版的「東北導報」「國民新報」和「前進日報」日文版，每家差不多都具備着優勝的印刷條件，大家爲了多發揮宣傳效能，多在隨報附送書報。</p>
<p>敵偽的電影院，約計有八家，都由中宣部東北特派員長春辦公處接收過來，所演的片子，有上海出品，但多已陳腐，其中以偽滿「滿映」出品最多，日本片子也不在少數，這是經過了檢查，而後得以允准放映的，據潘特派員公弼先生說：「僞滿和日本所製具有建設性的片子，改換了說明，還可暫時利用，以維持影業現狀，將來中央攝影塲新片到達時，就可以換一下觀衆的口味了。」</p>
<p>所有影院，現均受中宣部東北特派員長春辦公處所控制，影商出租金經營之，長春最大的中山堂劇塲，據云三民主義青年團最近也可把它交出來，由中宣部東北特派員長春辦公處做合理的利用。</p>
<p>文化運動委員會，聽說也在長春展開了工作，當可有所表現，市長趙君邁說：「長春印刷條件，優於東北其他各地，一般文化水準也很高，希望大家能善於發揮這優越的條件。」</p>
<p>冷落了偽宮府</p>
<p>偽皇宮門庭冷落了，不但門前事馬稀，同時正門又上了鎖，記者乘車經過「宮內府」大門時，樓頂屋　黃色的琉璃瓦，反射着暗淡的徵光，荒草萋萋的宮門外，有一隊兵在練操，宮府院內有三兩個士兵走向　邊，此外除了右側春歌槍的衛兵外，那就沒有什麽了。</p>
<p>長春，雖然不能長久是春天，但目前的夏天，總還算優美恬靜，祈禱蕭殺景象不來臨。</p>
<h3 id="c124">陪都的雲翳 <a href="#c124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>— 三日重慶航訊　青石</p>
<p>盛夏期內的重慶，整個社會似已沉淪於無聊的狀態中。現在先說商人吧！這裏的商人智慧並不見得比「腳底下」的商人弱（川人稱江浙人爲脚底下人他們《樣知道弄錢，爭着做投機買賣。</p>
<p>洋貨來了山崩潮湧</p>
<p>玻璃貨充斥市塲，進口洋貨商人的胃口比起海派還要大，「玻璃」「原子」的牌號隨處可聞，幾有缺一無市之感。商人個個聰明，大家敏捷，有時一件時髦貨同時擁到，因出路狹小，反形成滯凝狀態，就拿美國玻璃梳子來說，二月前售三千元一個……並且在華貴的百貨商店裏才有……後來祇售到一千五百元一把，最近又跌到一千元。其他的洋貨亦是如此。這中間最倒霉的是小商人與馬路攤販，他們以高利貸入的資本來作洋貨經營，起初還有一點苗頭，現在凍結起來，無不叫苦連天，巨買賣辦是不會受損的。他們消息靈通，此行不佳又圖別門，反正錢多，週轉靈便，失此取彼，總是贏得幾個，所以這一社會，有錢的更有錢，沒錢的儘管用心還是沒錢，「大錢生小錢」一點也不差。</p>
<p>洋貨來了，正如山崩潮湧，經濟貧乏如我國的中小工廠想堵塞這陷坑泛口是不可能的。工潮正在閙個不休：遣散，停閉，縮小，日有所聞。據統計已有三百六十餘家工廠就在這些科紛中犧牲了。現在剩下來能勉强維持的，不是擁有極大財力，便是有官僚資本參加，或某種特殊勢力予以保障。一個月來這些苟延殘喘的廠商經不起洋貨的侵襲，曾一度呼籲求救……什麼提倡用國貨運動……盡管喊破喉腔，却獲不得一點共嗚的反應，結果，改行，投機。工廠歇閉，另　別業，機器如棺材中的死人，已無人問聞，「生產」二字，亦已逐漸消失於廠商口中，一切都聽天由命，讓風雨任意地侵襲。</p>
<p>建設陪都僅存口號</p>
<p>政府離渝時有個口號「建設陪都」，在這個富有歷史意味的口號之下，卻忙壞了市政府及市參議會的官員們，開會，討論，計劃，件件週全，興築下水道工程嗶，兩江大橋　，新型馬路　，無軌電車　！一個陪都眞同描寫的美畫，市民聽了亦無不悅耳！但是說了幾個月，登了無數次報，到現在經費依然一籌莫展，徒作「紙上談兵」。不但這偉大的計劃毫無實現，連原有的一點文明，也漸漸地退化了！過云電燈是定期分區停電，雖不數區域暫時黑暗，大部份區域是光明的，因為停電有定期，市民已早預備燈燭，故並沒有影響夜間的工作，如今　卻弄得時時停電，處處停電，黑暗無常，叫一般市民哭笑皆非，損失匪淺。自來水亦常常停供，令一般挑水爲業的苦力，幾爲爭水而集衆毆鬥，水價遂爲劇漲。說到公共汽車的故事，眞是脚底下人所未嘗聞見的，汽車是七八年前的愈齡物品，政府未還都時曾允撥百輛新車增換，後來物資被「劫收」一空，加之公文旅行費時，遲遲未能兌現，政府還都後，這點綴而近乎歷史的都市，已漸被人們遺忘了。</p>
<p>垃圾山積穢水洋溢</p>
<p>這裏的公共汽車比上海各地「科學化」它的尾部會散放烟幕，其味惡臭，不堪向邇，每駛入街心，或拖一縷直綫的姻幕，或隨風旋轉似」條灰黑的滾龍。可惜人們見而生畏，無人去欣賞它的姿態。這裏的垃圾是全國有各的，有些地方竟堆積如山，南區支路垃圾坍倒，曾釀成空前慘劇，被壓死居民九人，當時各報揭露其事，警局一度緊張掃除工作，事後傳冷清無人置問了。僻巷冷街，垃圾　尿，遍地可睹，炎陽一出，便臭氣逼人，每臨暴雨，便穢水四溢，令人無法涉足，你走路稍留心朝街道看看，隨處都可尋獲死老鼠，自晨迄晚，亦無人掃除，所以夏天疾病流行，這不能說不是個因素。住在陪都的人，好像看慣了不足爲奇，也無人向衛生局提議，所以這些主持淸潔機關者，似乎亦樂得偸閒不管了</p>
<p>大小舞廳勇往直前</p>
<p>一切都沒有進步，但是我們不能否認跳舞廳確有勇往直前的改進，這裏大小舞廳有七個，中美·夜花園，國際·重慶俱樂部·盟友·揚子江及一個尚未開張的，每個舞廳爲了競爭生意，都在佈置上改良，華麗·舒適·男女迷醉其間，釀出不少社會　色新聞，政府當局幾度欲接受大衆的建議禁舞，但是舍不得這一筆龐大捐稅的收入，「禁舞」二字僅成口號而已，事實上陪都的文明建設，舍舞廳外，別無精華可論，最近一般生意人却注意到旅館餐室，於是相繼建築新型的旅館及餐室，如皇后飯店·大華飯店·會仙大廈·永年春飯店·標準飯店，都是數億元資本的。新建而未完成的尚有數家，尚未列入。目前單房間一萬一千元，在這裏的價格已算驚人，但是「上海客」說這祗有上海三分之一的價錢，還稱便宜，可見這世界已無絕對昂貴，亦無絕對便宜，一切貴康的標準全在於比較與少數人的評值而已。</p>
<p>復員運輸心灰意冷</p>
<p>說到復員運輸，眞叫人人心灰意冷。政府自身亦不改說黨政軍各機關能限期完全復員，老百姓當然更不必談了。第一期的確復員了一批，遠在政府還都以前，第二期爲急濟湘鄂之災，船舶全部調作運糧，第三期軍事形勢吃緊，便將船舶移爲軍運，飛機亦减少了，現在便是第三個時期，這裏等待着復員還鄕的人尚有三十餘萬。上月閱報亦不過此數，可見並無減少。復員船隻少了，黑市買賣便增多了。由渝直達南京黑市總需五十萬元，飛機則視緩急　別價格，有一百五十萬，有一百萬，最低亦需五六十萬元，有錢的人來回不息，無所謂困難，　苦的人無不犬天叫難，在等復員船隻的小公務員及義民，不斷地演着飢餓顚沛的生活，都市的幅面很大，坐在房裏或不曾親自考騐的人，是不會明白亦不會看見它們的呻吟與悲痛。</p>
<p>陰霾籠罩畸形變幻</p>
<p>輿論界難道都不知道嗎？就是知道，你在報上說幾句風涼話，痛不痛癢不癢就有什麽作用呢！何况現在人心乍惡變，個個畏事，說到新聞界不由記者感覺得慚愧無地，因爲自已也是其中之一員，這裏的報紙，眞正能替老百姓說句話的，却極鮮見。</p>
<p>陪都的一切都在畸形中變幻。這一塊聖潔的土地，偉大的司令台，在政府還都之後，一切彷彿籠罩在陰霾裏我希望遼遠的光來照明她，但是「遠水難救近火」，這希望不免就在暗淡中消失！</p>

<p>— 本報五日西安航訊　特約讀者李馳</p>
<p>有一個警政統計，說明了西安一市犯罪的社會相：今年上半年（一月至六月底）內市警局經辦與姻毒有關的案件，合計達二一八案，人犯二二三名。另據陝省保安司令部發表統計，該部在同期內已判決的同類案件，屬市內的有二四五起，判死刑的一八名，有期無期徒刑共一七四名，（該部在同期內判決的毒案，屬外縣區的，共計一五四〇起，判死刑的一六二名）綜觀上述兩治安機關的統計，我仍不能不說，要澈底肅淸此間煙毒，在目前尚是一件嚴重的問題，同時我仍深信負責當局正在決心加緊執行，才有上述的數字，但核算一下，一年內平均每五百個市民中就有一個與毒案有關，這不能不令人咋舌而寒心了！陝省禁姻協會與西安市分會最近相繼成立，下月一日起，該分會開始辦理施戒工作，對於一切決心戒毒者自行申請以後，該會即予種種方便，此外尚可救濟其戒毒期間的家屬生活，供給戒毒者本人之食宿，並保守一切秘密。在施戒時該戒毒者本人如被人吿發，該會亦予以合理保陣。這不能不算是一件德政。據說：陝省辦禁政有環境上特殊困難處，要澈底的解決，其問題或許要牽到比禁政　圍更大的范範以外。</p>
<p>「癮君子」的「黑米」無人不希望澈底禁絕；但一般人的「白米」却希望它貨足價跌，可惜後者事與願違，昨省參議會駐會委員會通過一件臨時動議：「近日糧價穩定，土粉亦未漲價，而各麵粉公司竟將存麵壓不出售，顯係居奇，以致機粉布價突漲，刺激一般物價甚鉅，擬請咨省府迅即查處，以安人心，……」昨天麵價每袋增至一萬三千五百元，幸而大米漲後尚穩。省府最近通電各區專署與市府，切實執行糧食議價辦法，原則是祗許合法糧商營運食糧，禁止非法商人之兼營糧業，或囤積居奇操縱。</p>
<p>「吃飯好不容易啊！」市立敎標準的薪金。這對於他們來說是「杯水車薪」，然而在一個喉頭已乾渴得灼熱的人，再沒有比一杯水更爲寳貴了。——水啊！在西安每車售價最近已由一百九十元增至八百元；而一斤麺粉僅能換到兩斤木炭而已！</p>
<p>視籌備西安市自來水廠，似乎久有此義，過去參議會中亦有人提及此事，不過限於器材的供給，遲遲不能實現。最近籌備的具體化，可見於省府此次通過設立自來水廠籌備處這議案。據悉此項建設計劃之舊事重提，因爲我方在美軍剩餘物資中獲得了十多部自來水廠設備，陝省當局一度晋京已接洽得分讓其中一部，將來運陝安裝在西安。不足够的鉛絲管，另行設法添購，器材已不成問題，資本的籌集亦不成問題了。</p>
<p>這件市政也是「討光」於戰爭：西安城內的馬路，直而長，交通口百分之八九十是垂直的正十字形，這三點已合乎都市道路的標準，惟有路面欠佳，下雨天泥濘陷足，括風天黃族亂飛，當局爲整備市容和改良路政，已決定在接收河南日軍物資中，劃出一大宗柏油，作為修建市內柏油路之用。他日實施完成，恐怕還是在西北諸都市中的創舉。在目前，市府先着手翻修十四條馬路　，短期內即可招商投票。市民們熱望早日完成這幾項計劃。</p>
<p>從昨晚起，警局嚴　執行靜夜措置，馬路上在半夜後，即禁止任何叫賣聲及擾人安寗的噪音，同時禁止沒有身份證的居民於夜半後在市街上來往，以防止不良份子的活動。另據一說：市內近來有好些地小孩子無故失踪，是因為非法者設計拐賣，他們在鐵路沿綫秘密地設有販賣人口的機關，當局已嚴予注意，務求保障市民的安全。</p>

<h3 id="c130">復興廣東蠶絲業 <a href="#c130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>— 何志端</p>
<p>（下）</p>
<p>不幸在西江一度陷敵期中而損失，故本省蠶種塲之籌設，急不容緩，若以冷藏庫不易立即購置，則製種塲之地址，應選擇有風穴或山洞，足以冷藏蠶種之自然環境，以解決目前缺乏冷藏設備之困難，在昔農民對於改良種之推廣，囿於舊習，不易接受，今情形特異種子缺乏，此時從事推廣改良，可收事半功倍之效。</p>
<p>第二期應增設之塲所：（一）蠶業指導所，指導農民栽桑育蠶製絲蠶絲經營及生絲貿易，組織稚蠶共育室，公共烘繭室，製絲合作社，生絲運銷合作社，絲織造合作社；（二）蠶種取締所，杜絕不規則之製種家，濫製蠶種，（三）生絲公倉，此外關於生絲檢騐機構，已有經濟部商品檢騐局負責，無另行增設之必要，第三期須增設之塲所：（一）蠶業職業學校，訓練實科之中下級人才；（二）蠶業子弟學校，訓練蠶業從業者之子弟，以養成蠶業之次代基幹；（三）蠶絲試騐塲，從事於本省蠶絲試騐研究，以謀改進。</p>
<p>四·人才之羅致</p>
<p>本省蠶業人才之來源如次：（一）中山大學農學院蠶桑系畢業生，合計不滿四十人；（二）省立仲凱農業學校，每屆蠶科舉業生最少十人，最多不過廿人，至現在共十六屆，合計不滿二百五十人；（三）順德農業職業學校，現已停辦，該校蠶科畢業生，僅有三屆，共計不滿五十人，此就本省蠶業之中層幹部而言，再次則有中山大學農學院之蠶桑講習班，及嶺南大學農學院之蠶桑訓練班，現均已停辦，所訓練之技術人員，為數不多，至於上級領導之專門人才，僅有中山大學農學院　桑系之各敎授，　　無幾，足見本省蠶業人才之貧乏！反　現狀，此輩專門　術人才</p>
<p>由於戰事本省蠶絲業場所有　　致無用武之餘地，或由於戰時月薪階　待遇清苦，而見異思　，不能緊守本業之工作崗位，乃甚或有失業徬徨，投閒置散者，此種現狀，常然不能任其存續於復員建國之今日。爲亡羊補牢計，一方面須行人才登記，使改業者及失業者，各盡其材於復興本省蠶絲業之工作上，然在工作高度發展之不久將來，此小　人才，實不數川，設即加緊訓練，亦不能一　即就，而難業復興，爲本省經濟建設之急務，萬不能以人才不足，而因咽廢食，關於治標方法有二：</p>
<p>１日本國內蠶絲人才之借用，日本蠶絲業發展成績，頗堪注意，其南部各縣如冲　等地方氣候，與木省略似，我國抗戰期間，本省蠶絲業，備受日敵之掠奪與破壞，用彼國人才，從事於從頭收拾之工作，　　解　，亦至合理。</p>
<p>２由其他專門人才，補充蠶絲人才之不足，蠶絲學與自然科學或應用技術，常有密切關聯，例如習菓樹森林農作物者，可負責栽桑技術，習生物昆虫者，可負責養蠶製種技術，習農業化學工業化學機械工程工廠管理者，可負責製絲或生絲撿騐等技術，習農業經濟工業經濟者，可負責繭絲貿易或蠶業行政工作，故蠶絲業復興之人才，不僅限於大學農科畢業生，而法科工科理科商科之　門人才，亦可羅致任用，基於上述方法，大可不患人才之缺乏、此外治本辦法，當爲中等農業職業學校之增設，大學農科之補助充實，各蠶絲業塲所訓練班之附設等。</p>
<p>五·蠶區擴展</p>
<p>本省原有蠶絲業之分佈地帶，可分數區域言之：</p>
<p>一，中區主要分佈地如次：順德縣之大良，容奇，桂洲，良敎，水藤，勒流，樂從，鶯洲，倫敎，龍江，龍山，南海縣之官山，西樵，九江，洲，石灣，羅村，沙頭，河　，中山縣之第三第八第九區，鶴山縣之坡山，水口，越塘，棋冲，古勞，維敦，十九堡，三水縣之西南市，新會縣之東北部。</p>
<p>二，西區主要之分佈地如次：高要縣之祿步，西屯，八桂，東屯，安懷，筍洞，德應縣之三厢，留村，羅洪，平安，昇平，及縣城，　南縣之建城，白夏，歷源，仙平，西壩，上四，四寗，都城，雲浮縣之五羌，都騎，澤源，粗石，封川縣之附城，下段，忠義，縣城，羅定縣之附城，平西，柑平。</p>
<p>三，北區主要分佈地爲樂昌縣及淸遠縣。</p>
<p>四，東區主要分佈地爲惠陽縣。</p>
<p>五，南區主要分佈地爲茂名縣徐聞縣。</p>
<p>綜觀原有蠶區，以中區爲最盛，西區次之，東南北三區，極不發達，中區爲珠江三角洲，面積約二萬方里，爲河流冲積地，灌　便利，土壤肥美，　被利用以種桑麻稻蔗，爲本省重要之農業地帶，以耐早耐　之桑樹，栽於沃土，在土地利用上，似覺可惜又以地勢卑濕，每値黃梅雨季，桑葉含水量特多，蠶兒虛弱易病，故二三四造，易不作，且絲質較港，難耐久貯，惟此地帶，向爲本省主要蠶區，當地有熟練技術之蠶農、經歷淘汰之經騐農法，原有簡陋之物質基礎，故尚有維持之價値、西區爲西江沿岸各縣，蠶桑分佈，僅限於西江沿岸，土　深厚，頗宜栽桑，獨惜每年六月至九月間沿江兩岸，均有潦患，使桑葉易變泥桑，以作飼料，須多費勞力，且當蠶造正盛，蠶室亦須遷徙，是其缺點，此區蠶業，尚在幼稚時期，尚須下更大努力，以謀發展，所須拓展之蠶桑區域，爲東南北三區，東北兩區，山嶺崇峻，無潦患之處，除斜坡地宜林外，其微斜坡地，旣不宜栽培集約作物，亟宜桑樹栽培。南區爲平坡地，一望無垠，面積約三萬方里，土　深厚，風化透澈，多已荒廢，至宜栽桑，總之維持三角洲蠶區，發展西江蠶區，開拓東江北江及南路蠶區，實爲目前要圖。</p>
<p>六·結論</p>
<p>蠶絲業復興，固有待於精密計劃，完善組織，與充裕財力，然蠶絲業工作者，尤貴有高度之事業心與責任感，重視國家之利益，不惜一己之犧牲！爲求工作效率之提高，不特須抱有奉公守法及破除官僚主義之消極行爲，井須發揮其服務於國家民族之積積性。</p>
<p>勝利後之經濟建設，爲今後建國之主要課題，本省蠶絲業，在暫時所受之創傷至深，今後與經建　係亦至密切，因之無人熱望本省農林當局，對此事業，予以嶄新認識，迅速展開，確實改進，以新速實精神，復興本省蠶絲業。</p>
<p>本月來，有數宗使熱心蠶絲業者滿足興奮之事；（一）農林部顧問張禹九氏及專門委員王龍生氏，由渝飛粵，與省當局洽商復與蠶絲業事宜；（二）羅主席諭示組織廣東建設研究委員會，內分經濟政治文化三糾，吾人預料在經濟組內，對於本省今後之絲業建設研究，必不致被忽略；（三）農林局擴大改爲農林處行政組織旣擴大，則對於蠶絲業建設之作用，亦可增強；（四）廣州商品檢驗局，行將開始輸出生絲之檢騐，對內促進生絲品質改良，對外提高國際貿易信用，五人誠望繼此前奏之後，對於復興本省蠶絲業有更積極之工作開展。</p>

<p>— 徐百益</p>
<p>四·製造</p>
<p>在一個企業組織組織的時候，或者組織完成，那時候，對於預備生產的貨品，當已早有計劃，有許多製造廠，並且還以貨品的名稱作爲廠名的。</p>
<p>所以關於所製造的貨品，對於組掛企業，有很大的關係，因爲由於貨品，就可以決定每年約有多少營業可做（調查市場參考同類貨品的銷路）需要怎樣的廠房和設備，需要多少資本，這些間題，都是擬製一個創業計劃書的重要資料，有許多公司在招股的時候，就附有計劃書，使投資人認爲將來有很大的希望，或者是有利可圖，樂於投資。</p>
<p>我們現在要討論的是在製造工作開始的時侯，所需要考慮的問題，這些問題，很可能在企業組織着手的時候，己經有具體的計劃了，好在事在人為，一切事情都是可以活做得，祗要知道了各種原則；就可以舉一反三地加以運用。</p>
<p>甲·貨品的設計</p>
<p>由誰設計：在製造一件貨品之前，一定要把理想中的貨品，加以設計，這設計的工作，由誰擔任，　着各種企業組織而不同，如果是一個人獨　經營的一家製造廠，那末那主人可以自己設計或請人設計以後，由他自己取決，最爲簡單，如果是合夥組織或無限公司，那末就要由幾個人共同討論，如在一個股份有限公司，經理人有　　處置之　，那末由他決定，若　　會對於這方面非常重視，那末應由　事會共同討論，照例關於貨品的設計，影響貨品的銷路很大，應該由　事會詳加研究討論的，通常一個製造廠、主持生產事務的是一個廠長，他對於製造預備發行的貨品，往往是一個專家，因此他對於貨品的設計，也可以勝任愉快。</p>
<p>憑着他的學識，他可以製造出一種完美的貨品，和市上一般貨品比較起來，一定可以勝過牠們，但同時負責推銷工作的營業部份，也應該參加意見，因爲主持營業的人，對於市塲一般情形和主顧心理，應該是非常熟悉的，他應該盡量貢獻意見，以供製造方面的參考，否則廠長們單憑着學識製造貨品，一且不能銷行，等於是閉門造車了。</p>
<p>商業上的競爭是十分劇烈的，一個企業要存在而獲得利潤，對於貨品，非要認眞製造不可，通常情形，一家製造奶粉的製造廠、在開始製迭之前，一定要把市面上所有的奶粉　都買來做參考，研究牠們的成分，功效、色澤，裝潢，售價，然後自己制定一種製造的標　準，由公司的各部份重要人物，共同討論取決。</p>
<p>在取決貨品的設計的時候，有下列各點，是應該加以考慮的：</p>
<p>A對於製造的關係：每一種貨品，有他的特殊的需要，某種貨品需要很繁複的機器，某種貨品祗須要利用人工，即使是同一的貨品，也可以有幾種不同的做法，而幾種不同的做法的製造成本，都是不同的</p>
<p>一個製造廠，爲求獲得利潤起見，應使製造成本竭力減低，最合於理想的是用最低的製造成本，製成最高標準的貨品，因爲我們要減低製造成本並不要實行偷工減料的政策。</p>

<h3 id="c132">怎樣是藝術 <a href="#c132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>— 鄭午昌</p>
<p>怎樣是藝術？要解釋這個問題，似乎很費辭。現在比如說藝術家是蠶，蠶食桑葉，到相當時候，便能吐絲。藝術家是蜂，蜂采花汁，下相當工作，便能成蜜。絲是絲，蜜是蜜，不能說絲是桑葉變成的，蜜是花汁變成的。但不能不說蠶吐絲是和食桑葉有關係。蜂釀蜜，是采花汁爲原料。蠶吐絲，是蠶的藝術；絲，就是他的藝術品。蜂釀蜜，是蜂的藝術；蜜，就是他的藝術品。我的借蠶桑蜂蜜來解釋藝術，當然是極淺近而粗陋的比喻。人　天賦的聰慧，加以長時間種種的修養，所得到的藝太的食糧，絕不如蠶桑蜂蜜這樣的簡單而有限。所以發現於藝術製作的，自是千變萬化，燦爛繁績，各如藝術家先天的才知後天的休養，而各有美的發現。所以藝術家對於自然的一切，觀察·欣賞·領略·運以匠心，來表現他所獨得的美，要超乎自然，而不失自然的眞情和至理，才算是藝術。就是對於古人的製作，來傳摹移寫，也要食古而化，顯現自我的情感和技巧。如果不是這樣，狀寫自然，但求和自然一樣，傳摹古人，但求和古人一樣，無論自然和古人，決不能依樣狀寫，依樣傳摹的；就是能够；無非是自然，無非是古人，而沒有我。比如蠶食桑葉，仍以桑葉，蜂采花汁，仍爲花汁，何必多此一舉，有什麼意思。攝影是狀寫自然最機械的，但取景·配光·用意……，各因各人的技巧和情感的不同，所作分出美惡。至於戲劇·雕塑書畫·尤其是要超乎象外，得其寰中，而發揚我獨有的生命以爲美。所以範籌拷背印刷而沒有作者生命的製作，不算是藝術品。效顰·學步·傳聲·始終沒有自找出路的動作，不算是藝術。藝術的眞諦，是在新的路上，向美的方面而獨力創造的。藝術家各有各的眞美善的宇宙，莊嚴美麗憑你的知慧，和你的努力，去和那造物者遊。</p>
<h3 id="c133">繪畫與經濟 <a href="#c133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>— 兪劍華</p>
<p>繪畫和經濟的性質，不但絕不相同，而且很相反背，互相排斥；但是繪畫却無論如何不容易和經濟斷絕關係，此中似乎大有相反相成的道理。</p>
<p>普通都以爲繪畫是一種淸高的藝術品，應該十分純潔；畫家是一種淸高的藝術家，應該非常高尚，無論如何總不該錙銖必較，孳孳為利。畫家作畫應該為　而作畫，為發表自已的情感，表現個人的思想而作畫；不應該為生活而繪畫，更不應該為金錢貨幣而努力製作，事實上，千古的無量數畫家中間確乎有幾種人是不為金錢而作畫的，例如：</p>
<p>（一）帝王公侯—萬幾之暇，隨意揮灑，富爲王侯，自不必以晝易錢。</p>
<p>（二）公卿大臣—事務淸閒，生活優裕，以畫爲消遣之具。</p>
<p>（三）富豪鉅紳—阡陌連雲，珠寳充斥，下箸萬錢，揮金如土，以畫爲附庸風雅的手段。</p>
<p>（四）騷客狂士—風流瀟洒，不事生產，孤高絕俗，口不言錢，以畫爲表現情惑的工具。</p>
<p>上列四種人物，前三種是本身有錢實在不需要再藉畫歛錢。第四種是本身沒有錢，而賦性淸狂，不喜歡錢。這種人不但不以畫換錢，甚而至王公貴人念以金錢相求，愈不肯畫，反是知己友好或販夫走卒，隨意索取，他到也樂爲點染。生活上的需要不需要，他根本不放在心上，除了上述四種和四種類似的畫家以外，大多數的畫家都不能不靠　維持生活。靠畫維持生活也可以分兩種，一種是整售的，一種是零售的。例如歷代　院裏的畫家，一生一世都是爲政府作畫，每月　醫院的薪俸生活。可說是終身包工制，至於普通　畫的畫家都是零售的，買一張畫一張，買兩張畫兩張，是以件計酬的，」閒來　　青山　，不使人間　　　」　這是零售畫家的解　語。　篇　不入時人眠，　　　　　牡丹」，這是畫家的生意經，為　　生活，容易　　，不得不將畫品降低·以迎全顧客的心理。現在　　早已取消，政府更沒有餘　來　　畫家，　以　　謀生的　家只有　零　了。零售也可以分類種，一種是　　作品多福，製行展覽會，以便一時　售的；一種是今日一篇。明日一條的登門　　　。這其中自然因爲作品的優劣，名望的大小，價值的多少相去很是懸殊。不過同是以賣畫爲生，也有許多人對於潤筆的多少不大計較的，在維持生活之中，還保存了點風流儒雅的淸高分子。惟有那般錙銖必較，六親不認，唯利是圖，毫無情誼的畫家，那種視財如命，視書如貨品的樣子，實在比市儈還不如。叫人看了眞有「斯文掃地」，「儒雅道絕」的感覺。</p>
<p>畫家因爲離不開經濟，所以一個國家經濟的好壤，對於繪畫盛衰的影響是很大的。西洋如意·法·英·德·瑞·比·荷西諸國對於繪畫都很重視，畫家的生活大都不成問題。一個畫家成了名，他的作品不但社會上有人購買，政府裏以及博物院畫廊裏都爭先購買。</p>
<p>畫家因爲離不開經濟，所以也就離不開經濟中心的城市，例如古代意大義的威尼斯，現代法國的巴黎，英國的倫敦成了西洋畫的集中地。在中國經濟跟着政治跑的時候，歷代的京城都成了繪畫發達，　人聚集的地方，北平到現在還有這種現象。經濟單獨發展的地方繪畫也跟着發展最顯若的是乾嘉時代的揚州，淸末以來的上海。現在上海的畫家爲甚麽多如「過江之鄉」？雖然沒有確實統計，上海的畫家可以占全國畫家的一半，總不能算估計過高吧！這就是因爲上海是中國最大的商埠，唯一的經濟中心，有錢的人多，買畫的人也多，自然畫家也就「如水赴　」都趕到上海來了。</p>
<p>因爲上海是全國最大的經濟中心，又是全國人口最多面積極大的市塲，不但「羣賢畢至」，爲人材薈萃的地方，而且是「萬商雲集」，無論新舊中外甚麼貨物都可以買得到。人材多了，自然有觀摩競爭的機會；貨物多了，自然應有盡有，不　缺乏。例如在內地的小城市，固然人材　落，物資貧乏，就是較大的城市如濟南開封南昌福州西安等省城的地方。　　的人頂多也不過五六位，顏料紙張都時常缺乏，至於西畫用的油色畫布，更難遇到。在上海則畫家至少有幾百人，一切繪畫的用具，以至　畫的　絹都可以說無所不備，這予作畫的人以極大的便利。這種情形長住在上海的人不覺得，要是到內地去走走，就深切感到，我在抗戰期間，在浙贛閩三省走了七年，到處詢問國畫用的花靑，藤黃，緒石就沒買到過一次，其他也就可想而知了。</p>
<p>上海畫家多所以開展覽會的也多，骨董店多，收藏古　的人家也多，所以要想看新畫看舊畫在上海都很便利，其次便是北平。在西洋，法國的巴黎可以說是世界美術的集中地。畫家展覽會比上海還多，尤其公私設立的各種美術院，博物院，畫廊，名畫家的個人陳列室，集千古大作家於一堂，眞是琳瑯滿目，美不勝收。像這種建造　院，購買名畫，也非有巨大的經濟能力不可。中國也只有北平的故宮博物院，在抗戰期間幾千張古畫運來運去，也費了不少的錢，不是私人的力量可以担負的，所以要想繪畫發達，經濟的力量是不可忽視的一個主要條件。</p>
<h3 id="c134">畫中有詩詩中有畫 <a href="#c134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>— 金啓靜</p>
<p>我在若干時期以前，曾跟姜丹書先生去探訪蕭屋泉老先生。他老先生是姜先生的老師，所以我該稱他太老師了。在他簡陋的畫室裏，看到一付很不平凡的聯，便是鄭沅祝蕭老先生的壽聯：「畫中有詩詩中有書；人外無道道外無人」。句子的現成圓渾，眞是天衣無綫，當時給我很深的印象。</p>
<p>蘇東坡曾經批評王維說：摩詰之畫，畫中有詩，摩詰之詩，詩中有畫。其實；詩中有畫，亦不只王維如此，試看唐宋以來的詩家，也有很多的名句可以當此。譬如：綠樹村邊合，靑山郭外斜，靑楓江上秋帆遠，白帝城邊古木疎。山從風氣雲邊出，天向平蕪盡處低，溪迴綠卷平堤水，林缺靑分隔岸山。至如此類的名句，那一句不是畫呢？凡是寫景的詩，非有畫意不可的。</p>
<p>至於畫中有詩，也只要多看些宋元名畫，體會一下，那末，例子甚多，不勝枚舉。譬如：董北苑的龍宿郊民圖，夏玉禹的西湖春曉，李迪的風雨歸收圖，馬欽山的杯酒明月，黃十久的富春山圖，王黃鶴的谷口春耕圖，倪雲林的容膝齊圖，吳仲圭的漁父圖，米南宮的雲山圖，冷蓬頭的高高亭圖，仇十洲的秋江待渡圖，唐子畏的山路松聲等等，許多名作，那一幅沒有詩意？不過元以後的名作，多由作者自己題詠，把畫裏精華詩意，已經率直地發表了，造成詩畫一元化，不然；多耐人尋味的晝中有詩！我們看蕭老先生的畫，大氣磅薄，往往千里江陵，納之於寸楮尺幅間，彷彿韓昌黎的文章，神韵無窮，自然當起道畫中有詩的名句。</p>
<p>蕭老先生今年高齡八十餘，堪稱當代畫壇的祭酒，有正書局淸代畫史論他「　追宋元，以造化爲師。」他的山水，確是蒼勁渾厚，另關蹊徑，門弟子遍南北，屹然爲當代一大宗匠。倪雲林稱譽王叔明云：「筆精墨妙王右丞，澄懷臥遊宗少文，叔明筆力能扛鼎，五百年來無此君。」在王叔明時代的五百年間，正是我們國畫的黃金時期，豈沒有和王叔明抗衡並駕的畫家嗎？可見古人尚友的風氣非常淳厚，同道推崇有如此。所以；鄭沅恭維蕭老先生，未嘗不是這種精神所表現。蕭老先生在十年前，發行第二集畫册，序文裏自己說：「學畫逾五十年，深知此道深未易言」他體會了五十年的畫道，尚且謙懷若谷，正和耕烟老人說的：「五十年始悟靑綠之法」的意思，有所見略同的微妙。諺云：「學然後知不足」，蕭老先生的畫道，確有佛家「如人飲水，冷熱自知」的眞諦。決不是時下一般成學粗習的畫道，所可相提並論的，而「人外無道道外無人」的名句，很久深刻地印在我底腦海裏。</p>

<h3 id="c136">歌劇的初期運動 <a href="#c136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>— 宋壽昌</p>
<p>歌劇於十六世紀末十七世紀的初葉，誕生於義大　北部的佛羅稜斯地方，當時文藝復興的思潮澎湃，一時，音樂方面受着它的鼓盪，便也起而響應，一般　尚希臘藝術的詩人和音樂家，聚集在一位伯爵巴爾　（Grovanni　Bardi）的邸中，從事古代希臘悲劇的復興運動，使中世紀繁複的對位音樂，仍返到純樸方面去，廢對位法而試用和聲，模仿當時俗樂的形式，於單音歌曲的下面，配以和音伴奏。其最初的作品，是彼利（Jacopoperi　1561-1633）利諾契夫（Rinoceini）和卡契尼（Ginlre　Carcini　1550-1618）所作的達夫尼（Dafne）這作品短小而富詩意。題材取給於神怪故事。「達夫尼」在一五九七年上演於　　　斯，得到相當的成功，不過還是嘗試性質而不　公開。等第二個作品爲祝賀敎主亨利第四的婚儀所　　　　優麗狄思（Euricice）於一六〇〇年公開演出，　　起了一般人的注目，這種作品的組織和形式，是　化於盛行十六世紀的牧歌，感覺牧歌不適宜於　中人物對話之用，故在古式的收歌體之外，再加用　　　敍調（Recitatiue）和以幾種樂器的伴奏，自　　　　　，歌者便根據言語自然的音調，而發表感情，絲毫不受音樂的拘束。這種歌調好似說白，可是仍爲旋律的，歌劇的效果因之大著。</p>
<p>從佛羅稜斯產生了歌劇以後，這種新藝術運動影響到威尼斯，意大利的歌劇漸呈發達的狀態，在威尼斯要算蒙特韋爾諦（Claudis　Monteruerdi　1567-1643）對於歌劇的貢獻最偉大，他底作品可說是近代樂曲的始祖，他是一位大天才音樂家，大胆地應用不協和音，擴大歌劇中管弦樂底組織，創用弦樂器的Tremolo以增强戲戲的效果，關於戲劇的表情，尤注意於音樂和戲劇的融和，利用不同樂器的音色和特性。盡量地描寫，他底名作有奧菲渥（Orfeo）亞利昂那（Ariannu）湯克萊諦（Tancredi）等，這些作品比第一個歌劇達夫尼大有進步，用三十九個樂器組成的樂隊作伴奏，其旋律與和聲都非常的優美而有豐富的表情，自歌劇中用弦樂的效果以後，管弦美隨着歌劇底發達而逐漸進步，從此器樂不僅爲伴奏之用常常獨立演奏於歌劇的序曲（Overture）了。</p>
<p>到了十七世紀的後半，義大利歌劇的中心地，由威尼斯移到意大利南部的那坡利（Nople）地方，歌劇起了革新運動，其特徵爲偏重於劇中歌調的旋律美，這一派的首領爲史卡拉諦（Alessandro　Scarlatti1659-1725）他創立一種義大利式的序曲（Overture）加入於歌劇開幕之前，用音樂的演奏，暗示將演出的歌劇底內容，這種序曲是由急速，徐緩，急速的三個音樂章而組成。以形式而論，實在是一種純粹的器樂音樂，後世的交響樂（Symphony）便從這形式演進而成的。對於聲樂方面，更有特殊的貢獻，他以爲佛羅稜斯派的歌劇只注重宣敍調而忽略旋律，於是另創一種咏嘆調（Aria）來補救它的缺點，歌唱的旋律便益發美麗而抒情的了。</p>
<p>後來義大利的歌劇勃興運動，向歐洲大陸其他地方擴展開去，法英德諸國都起而響應，其中以法國路易十四的宮庭樂長魯利（Giouanni　Lalli　1632-1684）所創製的作品較爲特出。他注重應用譚歌（Ballad）幷努力於劇詞和音樂的調和，法國式的序曲也由他所完成。用徐緩樂章，急速的賦格曲（Tngue）和舞曲的終曲而成立一個樂曲。</p>
<p>綜觀上述關於義大利歌劇勃興運動的經過，和主音樂底長音有關係的，聲音方面爲牧歌，　叙調，咏嘆調，和譚歌等形式的演進，使和聲的伴奏以逐漸地發達，器樂方面則爲創用序曲，替管弦樂建立了一個基礎，再由這形式加以擴展而成立純粹的器樂曲，影響以後交響樂的產生，道些和主音樂形式底發展都給予以極大的帮助。</p>

<p>— 少夫</p>
<p>本市有大批敵僞房地產，據說處理局將公開標售了，不過其中有一個但書，就是「除經核定估價讓售及奉令撥用者以外」，這個但書中所包括的文章很多、。日放在一邊，先來談公開標售。</p>
<p>近來報紙上雖不大提到房荒，我們知道本市的房荒依然很嚴重，決未因不提及就解決或减輕了。市政當局甚至有撥專款建築市民住宅，以及限令地主造屋的計劃。從這里可以證明，目前上海還未到「屋多於人」的狀况。</p>
<p>然而，說來也眞奇怪，房屋雖未多於人，事實上卻造成了屋多於人的現狀，這話怎麼說哩，原來眞正需要房屋的人，却無力得到房屋，而少數有錢的人却掌握了極多的房屋在奇貨可居，在講金條美鈔作頂費押租小費等等，一方面出不起金條美鈔，因此也就無處可容身；一方面不易得到金條美鈔，房屋也就空起來了</p>
<p>今日的上海，就存在着這樣的矛盾現象。</p>
<p>大批敵偽房地產公開標售，什麼麼人能標購呢？是你？是我？很顯然的是那極少數的有錢人。這班極少數的有錢人是否眞正標購了去自己居住呢？非也！他們早有很舒服的洋房了。於是我們不難想像得到，所謂公開標售的敵僞房地產袛是在帮助少數人發財，支持上海流行的金條美鈔頂費制度，使大多數人無家可歸而已。</p>
<p>倘使政府的政策是在帮助少數人發財，倘使政府的政策是在支持金條美鈔的頂費制度，我們大多數人祗好無家可歸了。</p>
<h3 id="c138">何處救知　校門外的孩子往那裏走 <a href="#c138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>— 呂恬</p>
<p>爲了子女的求學問題，接迎跑了幾個學校，請朋友寫了許多介紹信，却處處「免戰牌」高掛，「恕無學額，效勞不週」，學校荒的嚴重，給學校富局以艱困的應付，子女們沒有書讀，家長心中更是焦灼萬分。勝利了一年，孩子們連書也讀不到了，這應是如何嚴重的問題！</p>
<p>房荒之患不在寡而在不均，學校荒却實實在在因爲學校太寡，學級不够。上海復員以來，人口在急劇的增加中，礙於經費和其他技術上的問題，學校不能和增加的人口比例的提增，所以處處感到學生太多，學額太少。爲適應目前事實，解除學校荒的嚴重性，應立時普遍採用「半日制」；學生半日在校，半日在家，把課程集中在在校的半日，課後工作和休息移到在家的半日。這樣，一隻敎室可以容納二學級的學生，本來只能收五百個學生的學校，現在可以收一千個。我不能說半日制好到怎樣，至少，目前許多學生——尤其是小學生的求學問題，可以解除了。</p>
<p>關於半日制的實施，還有幾點須得說明：</p>
<p>（一）充分利用空間：學校荒的問題中心在經費，校舍更佔經費的中心。施行半日制以後，同一敎室，甲級在上午上課，乙級在下午上課，人可以輪流休息，空間被充分的利用了。</p>
<p>（二）節省物力：目前敎育當局不能使學校經費和事實開支平衡。施行半日制以後學級增加了，一校的學級經費自須如數發放，但普通的開支如房租水電等的負祖，不會因增加一半學級而增加一半的開支，如此統籌支付，可以减少經費收支不平衡的一部分。</p>
<p>（三）改善敎師待遇：現在小學中平均約由一個半敎員負責一級。施行半日制以後，因爲課務的集中，可以由一個敎晨負責一級，敎師固然辛苦些，但待遇可以提高了。這樣，每級經費的發放在當局仍發例行之常，在敎師却不無小補。在這敎師待遇不能配合社會生活指數的今天，也可以稍使他們鬆一口氣。</p>
<p>施行半日制的主要目的還在消除目前小學學類不够的病態，請　明的敎育行政當局從速擬訂辦法，提付施行，救救那些徘徊在校門口無法進入的孩子吧！</p>

<p>現在世界上的發明已經有些似奮神怪小說（如火燒紅蓮寺，西遊記，封神榜之類）中的種種了。</p>
<p>例如，在這些神怪小說中，最普遍而又人人所知道的，就是那些劍客，神仙，們的能口吐飛劍，萬里之外取人人頭，或者把手一招，一道白光就此出去，可是在此次大戰中，英國倫敦時常遭到德國的V1，V2，流星彈，這些流星彈均自遠地德國飛來，一且尾部又有白光，這不是有些　飛劍麽。</p>
<p>其次，則爲那些神仙劍俠們能停立雲端注視下界，觀看下界之種種，然而今日已有直降飛機之發明，又如同火燒紅紅蓮寺中的人物時常大發掌心雷，則今日有以無綫電操縱之原子炸彈，封神榜中有飛天，　地二人，飛天則爲任何人早已知道，有飛機，　地則可入地道，（此在我國則尚未有，然歐美各國已早有矣）再還有一些甚麽劍俠，神仙，能在水中激戰七晝夜之事，此則早已有軍艦潛水艇代之矣！</p>
<p>又封神榜中有千里眼，順風耳二人，千里眼，前有望遠鏡，今日則更進一步，有無綫電傳眞器之發明，順風耳至今還是以無綫電替之。</p>
<p>不過至今似沒有一樣發明，能抵得上孫悟空的一個跟斗——十萬八千里。</p>
<p>總之，現在的世界是已經像舊神怪小說中的那些劍客，神仙們在鬥寳，要看誰的法寳多，誰的法寳厲害，就誰能稱王。</p>
<h3 id="c140">活不下去了！ <a href="#c140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>— 萍京</p>
<p>敎師，這神聖而又淸高的職業，是國家民族幼嫩苗的園丁，是新生代的保姆。每一個先進國家，對敎師的地位都十二萬分的重視。因爲，國家十年二十年後的命運趨向，正執掌在今日爲園丁爲保姆的敎師手裏。</p>
<p>可是，在咱們中國可有點兒不同，當敎師的連生活都得不到一些安定，整天嚷着活不下啦！哼！聰明人全以爲當敎師是窮途末路了。只有傻子才想去幹哩</p>
<p>幸而在抗戰勝利建國開始的時候，政府當局立刻很正確的提出了「建國時期，敎育第一」的口號，同時，好些地方也紛紛發起尊師運動。但，可憐得很，兩句美妙的動聽的口號濟得了多少事？一次施捨式的「尊師」又把敎師的地位提高了多少？</p>
<p>敎師的待遇，抵不上車夫，抵不上工人，抵不上小販，陶老先生曾深深地嘆惜着說：「同樣爲人帶孩子，生活不如老媽子。」那麼，難道敎師工作的價值還及不上軍夫，工人，小販，老媽子嗎？朋友！請你再算一算吧！建國期，敎賈究竟該挨着第幾呢？</p>
<p>敎師，是人而不是「超人」，一樣有家，一樣要生活，難道眞讓敎師吃一輩子「神聖飯」，穿一輩子「淸高衣」嗎？</p>
<p>敎師　在游離，好些敎師要從敎育的隊伍裏開小差出去，難道眞讓敎育界充滿了渣滓式的敎師嗎？唉！還有多少好敎師尚肖堅守着崗位始終不渝呢？</p>
<p>據一般的估計，從事於小學敎育的敎師中，至少有百分之八十以上是無家庭負擔的年靑的女敎師，當然，我並不是說女敎師不適合於敎育，女敎師中間的確有許多熱心敎育的敎育戰士。但，我們可以很明顯的看出；男敎師已逐漸在退伍，他們的生活負擔使他們再也不能於敎育界存在了，他們有終生獻給敎育事業的志願，可是，生活鞭子把他們不斷的鞭策，這他們痛苦地逐漸脫離敎育界。</p>
<p>雖然，在本市敎育當局，也曾爲改善敎師待遇而頒佈了私校經濟公開組織經費籍核委員會的法令，規定以全部學費收入充作敎員薪金，並平均合理分配，而事實吿訴我們；除了一部份賢明的校長肯自動遵照辦理外，另一部份以學校牟利的學店老闆還是視若無睹·或用種種方法掩飾，如添置掛名職等，倘敎師眞要極力爭取的說話，好，這便理下了學期結束時解職的主因。大部份敎師還是　若寒蟬。</p>
<p>所以，我們希望敎育當局，應提出更有效的辦法，隨時嚴格抽查各私立學校是否遵守法令，因爲在本市而論，私立學校還是佔全市學校的大部份的。對蔑視法令的學校負責人，當從嚴處分。</p>
<p>同時，關於私校敎員薪金學期初一次發給的辦法，願敎育當局亦能在最短期間予以公佈。我們的理由是有下列四點：</p>
<p>（一）學校當局的學費是一次收足的。且在學期初徵收學費時，其標準大致與常時物價比例相差不遠，但至學期結束，時隔半載，物價波動得太厲害，像上學期初薪金五萬（經濟公開的學校大概都在此數左右，但有些學校竟有不供膳宿五千元的。），約可購米四石，到學期結束時則拿來五萬薪金，連一石米也買不到了。</p>
<p>（二）免得再於中途加重家長負担而徵收第二次學費，因爲薪金一次發給，敎師對一學期的　　可以決定，生活略可保障，何必再徵收第二次學費呢？</p>
<p>（三）校長倘認爲担心敎師中途退職，則可採取速環保及舖保，反正所担保的僅是一學期區區之數的薪金，萬一發生中途退職情事，當然由保證人賠償損失。</p>
<p>（四）或以爲其他職業部門及公立學校均無此光例，要知道私校敎師的薪金在一學期中的分配數已有規定，決不會再有調整的可能，或額外的收入，像尊師金及徵收第二次學費等，僅只可以說是敎師生活恐慌後的補救辦法，那麽，對學期初防患於未然的辦法何樂而不爲呢？</p>
<p>以上的建議，希望敎育當局加以考慮，並願敎師，校長，家長，學生，共同討論，予以指正，庶减敎師的悲哀於萬一，敎師幸甚！敎育幸甚！國家幸甚！</p>
<h3 id="c141">牢騷 <a href="#c141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>

<p>— 周尚</p>
<p>「要必使下一代的身體強過我們，智能優過我們，品德超過我們！」</p>
<p>父親即爸爸·爹爹·或爺爺。集韵；「吳人呼父曰爸」。正字通；「夷語稱老者爲八八，或巴巴，後人因加父作爸字」。南史，「爹，父也·」宋史宗澤傳；「俗呼父曰爺爺。」</p>
<p>父親節雖然過去了，我還想向一般做父親的說幾句「父道」。古籍中有母師·母教·母儀·母范一類名詞，獨一時翻不出「父道」一類的話。今日敎育只敎人如何謀生，如何作事。却沒有敎人如何做父親。師範敎育祇教人如何做別人家的兒女的教師，也並不教人如何做己兒女的自老師。上海有些先生們提倡父親節，我想這個節日的意義，應該不是要兒女尊敬父親，反而應該多講些父親的教育，讓那些做了父親還不知道怎麽做的人想想。</p>
<p>父親敎育的主要課題是「父道」。父道的對象是兒女。兒女的敎養是母親的責任，然亦是父效的責任。古時「母氏劬勞」，因爲士之　自養其子，而今女子除做良妻賢母外，復做國人的職業，她們背着兼父作母的雙重負担，尤其是目前，她們正在過那「蠟燭兩頭燒」的摧殘生活。中國婦女傳統的人生觀本是根據在自我犧牲精神之上，不計報酬的做牛做馬，一百個忍耐，直忍耐到死而不作聲。但做父親的也總該體諒，分些責任教養兒女，切莫只銜着雪茄，坐在安樂椅上，眼睛看了鼻子，向妻子打官話，甚至嫖賭吃着，花天酒地，視家庭爲傳舍。</p>
<p>今日的兒女是民族生命的源泉，是建國的後備軍；一個民族將來的盛衰强弱，就看這個民族現在的兒女是否健全。勾踐推行「十年生聚，十年敎訓」的內政，這兩大事多屬於父道。父道的最低要求，要必使下一代的身體强過我們，智能優過我們，品德超過我們，達到下一代强爺勝祖宗，達到下一代盡是未來國家的　英。</p>
<p>欲求實現上述各事，便要在畫父道。畫父道先須注意兒女的下列四事：一日健康保護，二曰品德陶冶，三曰學問培養，四曰婚姻指導。今請學我說：</p>
<p>一，健康保護——有頭等身體的國民，才造得成頭等的國家。一個民族要具有黃金時代的文化，在三十年前，其國民必先有一個黃金時代的身體。希望兒女立大志，做大事，掦名後世，必須先保育他們有一個結實的健康身體。古時練習「射御」，用意甚深，寓衛國於自衛。健康分二方面：一爲心理，一爲生理，而彼此互生影響，從小就要打基礎，從成胎到大學舉業，每個階段都要特別留意。父親要照料母親懷孕時的生活，特別是飲食間題。以前迷信的「胎敎」，實則「胎養」，因爲胎兒神經不與母體發生關係，施敎無由，只有血管與母體相通，俾得吸收食料。兒女的乳齒和永久齒在受胎初期平已生根發育，營養適宜，牙齒便堅强。又如幼時受虐待，長大後易起精神病乃至自殺。這不過舉一二個例子而已。兒女出世到五歲，實在是營養時期；六至十二歲是大肌肉鍛錬時期，十二歲後才步入響識培養階段。爲父者，該澈底明　，而加以愼重的養護。</p>

<h3 id="e1">The Hope for Peace Has Not Yet Reached a Desperate Stage: Marshal and Ambassador Stuart Resolve to Continue Efforts; The Core Issues Remain Unresolved <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 11th] At 7 PM tonight, Zhou Enlai, accompanied by Wang Bingnan, accepted an invitation to dinner at the U.S. Embassy. Following dinner, they held talks with Ambassador Stuart and Advisor Fu Jingbo. They did not leave the embassy until after 10 PM. The discussions reportedly still revolved around old issues, such as the military reorganization plan, the withdrawal of troops from northern Jiangsu, and local government issues. However, no progress was made. They merely exchanged views on the core issues again. It is said that the Communist Party has no room for further concessions. Ambassador Stuart will visit Marshal tomorrow to convey Zhou Enlai's views from today. Whether or not Marshal goes to Guling will depend on the outcome of discussions on Zhou's views. This shows that both men have not given up on the final efforts for peace.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 11th] The Communist Party delegation held an internal meeting today to carefully study the statement issued by Marshal and Ambassador Stuart yesterday. They are awaiting instructions from Yan'an before deciding on a public statement. Zhou Enlai may hold a press conference tomorrow.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 11th] Special Envoy Marshall visited Ambassador Stuart at the U.S. Embassy at 9 AM this morning for two hours. It is understood that both men were quite disappointed with the outcome of their mediation efforts for peace. However, both agreed that the door to peace negotiations has not been closed. If both sides can make further concessions on the core issues, namely the issue of local administration after the troop withdrawal, negotiations can still continue. Both men are awaiting the reactions of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party to their statement issued yesterday to decide on their next course of action. Marshal has denied the rumors circulating last night that he would fly to Xunyang today.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 11th] In the peace talks, the issue of troop withdrawal and local administrative power has led Ambassador Stuart and Marshal to feel disappointed with their efforts to mediate peace because the Communist Party refused to accept the government's views, resulting in the issuance of this joint statement. However, both men believe that if both sides can make further concessions, negotiations may still continue.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guling, 11th] People here are not surprised by the issuance of the joint statement by Marshall and Stuart. The reaction from all parties to the joint statement has been uniformly positive. First, the joint statement clearly demonstrates the hard work, perseverance, and dedicated effort of the two men in pursuing peace with enthusiasm and courage. Second, the extent of progress in continuing peace talks can be better understood from the joint statement. Third, the crux of the current inability to reach an agreement lies in the nature of local governments in the areas from which troops are withdrawn, a problem arising from determining the areas of troop deployment. It is generally believed that replacing unification with division and guaranteeing separatism with autonomy are consistent with the Communist Party's approach. However, unified military and administrative orders are essential basic conditions for a modern national army. The two men will surely find a reasonable solution to transform contradictions into unity.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 11th] It is said that Marshal intends to issue a statement on the Anping Incident in the near future to express his position. It is understood that the statement is currently being carefully studied by Marshal.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 11th] Ambassador Stuart has decided to leave Nanjing for Beiping on Wednesday to handle school affairs at Yenching University. He will return to Nanjing in about a week.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 11th] According to Stuart's advisor, Fu Jingbo, Marshal is unlikely to return to the United States soon, and there has been no news of a fourth trip to Lushan.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Reactions to Marshal and Stuart's Statement Vary; Most Approve and View It as an Ultimatum <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 10th] According to well-informed diplomatic sources tonight, the joint statement issued by Marshal and Ambassador Stuart yesterday should not be seen as a sign of failed mediation, but rather as an ultimatum to both warring parties, urging them to withdraw and seek peace. Most observers said that when they initially read the statement, they all believed that Marshal and Stuart had publicly announced the suspension of negotiations. However, after examining the document more closely, they believe that it is undoubtedly a firm ultimatum.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 10th] Political circles here believe that Marshal and Ambassador Stuart's declaration in their joint statement that negotiations have reached an impasse indicates that the United States must re-examine its China policy. The current dangerous situation, where the political struggle between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, which has spanned two decades, has re-emerged on the battlefield, seems to be a reliable observation. Some political figures say that the United States has three options: a policy of non-intervention, a policy of "neither advancing nor retreating" (which the United States is currently adopting), and unconditional support for the National Government. These people insist that the United States must align its China policy with its global policy. When meeting with spokespersons for the CCP and asking for their views on the joint statement, they replied that the CCP was still studying it.</p>
<p>A Statement from a Certain Important Person</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch on the 11th] After the release of the joint statement by Marshall and Ambassador Stuart, a relevant person here told reporters, "From now on, negotiations will probably be put on hold temporarily." The spokesperson implied to reporters that some issues that cannot be resolved through negotiations will be resolved in another way. The spokesperson also predicted that Marshal would return to the United States temporarily, but reserved judgment on whether Stuart would continue to serve as ambassador. As for the question of whether the Executive Headquarters would "close down" under these circumstances, the spokesperson said that the Executive Headquarters would still continue to exist. (Cai Wenzhi, but should not disclose his name)</p>
<p>Ye Jianying's Opinion</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch on the 11th] Today, reporters visited Ye Jianying and asked for his opinion on the joint statement by Marshall and Stuart. The questions and answers are as follows: (Q) What are your thoughts on the joint statement? (A) I was very busy this morning, and I have only just begun to study it. (Q) Does this indicate that negotiations are impossible to continue? (A) The negotiations certainly did not yield results, but there is no clear indication that negotiations have broken down. (Q) Do you predict that Marshal will return to the United States? (A) I can't tell. (Q) Do you think Stuart will continue to serve as ambassador? (A) It's hard to say. (Q) Will the Executive Headquarters continue to exist? (A) As long as the Nanjing Three-Man Committee exists, the Executive Headquarters will also exist.</p>
<p>The Executive Headquarters Will Close</p>
<p>[United Press, Beiping, 11th] Since the release of the joint statement yesterday by Special Envoy Marshall and Ambassador Stuart, the Executive Headquarters for Military Mediation has been tending towards closing down because it cannot fulfill its mission of peace, and this has become increasingly imminent tonight.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Beiping, 11th] The American branch of the Executive Headquarters for Military Mediation is awaiting orders from Nanjing today to facilitate closure. Americans who have thoroughly studied the joint declaration by Marshall and Stuart believe that it is impossible to find hope for peace in China within it. In view of this statement, they firmly believe that the Executive Headquarters will be abolished.</p>

<p>[Our Guling Dispatch on the 11th] Chinese and foreign individuals have long awaited Chairman Chiang's statement on the current situation, indicating the government's approach to various issues.

It is understood that Chairman Chiang's August 14th statement is being finalized. It is said that the statement will reiterate the government's policy of peaceful resolution.

<p>[Another Dispatch] After Special Envoy Marshall and Ambassador Stuart issued a statement on the 10th regarding the mediation of peace in China, Zeng Qi, the leader of the Youth Party, and Liu Dongyan, a member of the Standing Committee of the party, visited Ambassador Stuart again at his residence at 9:30 AM on the 11th. Zeng said: The problems in China are indeed extremely complex and difficult, but encountering intertwined roots and knots makes the weapon visible. If approached with an indomitable spirit, it will not be difficult to achieve the final goal. However, haste makes waste, and one must not be too impatient and must be patient and resolute. He hopes that Ambassador Stuart will not be discouraged by the difficulties. The ambassador expressed his willingness to work towards China's peaceful unification, democratic strength, and prosperity, and to see it through to the end without giving up halfway. Zeng was very satisfied and stated that the Youth Party is willing to do its utmost to help.</p>
<h3 id="e6">Two Weeks After the Anping Incident, the Investigation Work Is Still Obstructed, and American Officials and Civilians Are Becoming Impatient and May Proceed Independently <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch on the 11th] Two weeks have passed since the Anping Incident, but the Executive Headquarters 25th Group, which was ordered to investigate the Anping Incident, has been beset with obstacles and has been unable to begin its investigation work as of today. It is generally believed that if the work of the group is further hindered, the American side may proceed with the investigation work independently in order to quickly complete its report, because American officials and civilians are becoming impatient to understand the truth of the Anping Incident. The 25th Group held another meeting at 9 AM on the 11th, which lasted 40 minutes, but no results were achieved. According to Chairman Davis, the instructions from the three members of the Executive Headquarters regarding the work of the group had not been received as of the meeting. He then tentatively suggested listening to the Marine Corps report, but Communist Party representative Huang Yifeng still objected. Davis then announced that they would await instructions from the three members and hold another meeting on the morning of the 12th. According to Ye Jianying, he has received instructions from Zhou Enlai stating that Marshal has agreed that the group investigating the Anping Incident will be chaired by the three parties in rotation, and that the investigation procedure will be discussed before the investigation begins. However, as of today, the official order from the Nanjing Three-Man Meeting regarding this matter has not been received.</p>

<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch on the 11th] The situation in Datong eased slightly today. General Ma Zhanshan's office in Beiping did not send any more urgent telegrams. However, the Communist Party representative of the Datong Group of the Executive Headquarters left Datong yesterday and went to the Communist area. Officials suspect that the Communist Party representative's departure was a planned action. The government representative, Lieutenant Colonel Li Xin, and the American representative, Colonel McTeer, are still in Datong, but they cannot work. The Pingfawang Power Plant and the Kouquan Coal Mine, which were occupied by the Communist Party, have not been destroyed, and they are planning to use the power from Pingwang to resume mining operations at the Kouquan Coal Mine.</p>
<p>[Our Tianjin Dispatch on the 11th] The stations on the Zhengtai Railway, which were attacked by the Communist army, have been completely recovered by the National Army. The Communist army has withdrawn from the railway, and the Railway Bureau has sent workers to repair all the damaged areas. If there are no special obstacles, repairs can be completed by the 15th.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch on the 10th] Baoding Telephone: According to military sources, traffic east of Yangquan and west of Zhengshui on the Zhengtai Railway has been completely cut off. On the 8th, the Communist army failed to destroy the Zhengshui Bridge and retreated. Its Jinbei Field Army is concentrated in the Jingxing and Niangziguan areas, and is well-equipped. Fighting continues in the Baiyangbao area. The Communist army along the Zhengtai Railway is advancing towards Taiyuan. The sound of cannons can be heard all day long in the area west of Shijiazhuang. There are no incidents around Baoding, but the city defense authorities have been stepping up precautions in recent days. The construction of city trenches is nearing completion, and bunkers in the suburbs are also being built rapidly.</p>

<p>[Our Tianjin Dispatch on the 11th] The U.S. Marine Corps Headquarters in North China announced the resumption of security exercises, which had been suspended for a year. During the exercises, all officers and soldiers assume that they are under enemy attack and engage in defense in an emergency state. Even giant tanks are mobilized. These exercises will now be held every Saturday. People who are concerned are pondering the implications of this move by the U.S. military.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Qingdao, 11th] Two U.S. transport ships, the USS Alnitah and the USS Rancher, arrived in Qingdao on the 10th, carrying regular troops from the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps.

<h3 id="e11">The Breach of the Dike Is Clearly a Planned Act of Sabotage; The Communist Army Uses Water as a Barrier; Who Are They Deceiving with So-Called Natural Causes? <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 11th] Regarding the Communist army's breach of the dike in northern Jiangsu, the Communist Party's Xinhua News Agency in Huaiyin claimed on the 10th: "A small part is due to natural causes, and the majority is caused by the Kuomintang's policy of civil war," placing all the blame for the disaster in northern Jiangsu on the Kuomintang. However, based on the terrain of the disaster area, we can gain the following understanding: (1) The flooded area south of Suqian City extends the Hongze Lake and connects the Yaowan flooded area. If Huaiyin is the center, this flooded area will form an arc shape, which can prevent the National Army from advancing beyond the arc and can protect the heart of the Communist army in northern Jiangsu, Huaiyin City. (2) The flooded area west of the canal around the Canal Station is designed to block the National Army's attack from Xuzhou. Longchiji has now fallen, and the reason why Suqian has been spared is that the Communist army has troops in Suqian. (3) The Donghai flooded area is only a few miles from Donghai City, but because Donghai City is located at a higher elevation, it has not been affected. However, its northern side is connected to the Yellow Sea, and the western side is connected to the Guanyun flooded area, isolating Donghai. Judging from the overall situation, the majority of the flooded area is not within the Communist army's area, which is clearly a planned act of sabotage, using the water as a barrier. Its impact has already made a very obvious impression on us.</p>
<h3 id="e12">The Situation at Huangkou Station Is Unclear; The Communist Army Fiercely Attacks West of Xuzhou <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 11th] The Communist army, which has been gathering in the border area of Jiangsu, Shandong, and Henan, suddenly attacked Huangkou Station, about 50 kilometers west of Xuzhou on the Longhai Railway, with three to four thousand men on the night of the 10th. A fierce battle broke out with the security forces stationed there. After the telegraph lines between Huangkou and Xuzhou were cut, the situation is unclear.</p>
<h3 id="e13">Unless the CCP Army Implements Unified Organization, the U.S. Will Never Consider Equipping Them - Mr. Acheson's Response to Questions on China Policy <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 9th] According to Under Secretary of State Acheson: the United States has absolutely not considered providing the Communist army with American-style training or even the most minimal equipment needs, unless the Communist army soon shows hope of unifying with the National Army and becoming a unified national army. His statement was made in a letter dated July 31st to Mr. Colber, Executive Committee Member of the newly established American China Policy Association. The letter was in response to the American China Policy Association's questions to the State Department on July 24th regarding U.S. China policy, especially the rumor that the Communist army would be supplied with American-trained equipment even before it merged with the National Army. The letter cited a statement by the President on December 15, 1945, considering that statement as the basis of U.S. China policy. The U.S. government has always opposed resolving political problems by force, and General Marshall is currently doing his utmost to enable the two major political groups in China to cooperate peacefully and form a joint government with representatives from all parties to fulfill the U.S. government's hope. This is well known. Military forces should be merged, and political aspects must also be merged. The agreement on the reorganization and unification of the army, signed in Chongqing on February 25, 1946, is the basis for the reorganization and unification of the armies of both the Nationalists and the Communists. For armies with different standards of equipment and training, any unification must be given an equal amount of time so that the chaos during unification can be minimized. However, unless the Communist army soon shows hope of unifying with the National Army and becoming a unified army of the Republic of China, the United States has no intention of providing the Communist army with American-style training or even the most minimal equipment needs. The armies under the direct rule of the National Government, according to the wartime thirty-nine division plan proposed by General Stilwell, are equivalent to thirteen corps, each with three divisions, each of which has American military equipment, and twenty divisions have been fully trained by the United States. The American China Policy Association was recently established, with Powell as Chairman and Mrs. Fairbank as Vice Chairman. The founders also include Green of the American Federation of Labor, Hopkins, President of Dartmouth College, Gideon, President of the Brookings Institution, and Cowles, publisher of newspapers and magazines.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 9th] Colber, a member of the Executive Committee of the American China Policy Association, announced on the 9th the letter he sent to Acting Secretary of State Acheson on July 31 regarding U.S. China policy. In the letter, Mr. Colber raised eight points, requesting answers to "better understand all aspects of your department's China policy" by the Committee of the China Policy Association. According to Mr. Colber's statement, the following questions were raised in the association's first letter to the State Department on July 24 and were not answered: (1) Does our aid depend solely on the Chinese government fulfilling the demands of the Communist Party, regardless of whether their demands are reasonable? (2) If the Chinese government is willing to abide by the agreements brokered by Marshall on January 31 and April 25 of this year, and the Communist Party still insists that the government make repeated concessions, will the U.S. military withdraw due to China's lack of unity? (3) Is Marshall ordered to force the Chinese government to accept further demands from the Communist Party? (4) In the Sino-Soviet Treaty of August 14, 1945, the Soviet Union promised to assist the Chinese National Government without any conditions, so why should U.S. aid to China depend on whether China reaches an agreement with the Communist Party? (5) Has the official received news that the Communist Party has violated the terms of the political agreement brokered by Marshall on April 10? If so, will you prepare to announce this notice or statement? (6) Regarding the consultations made by Hurley in 1944 and 1945, the committee made a statement. Is the essence of this statement correct? Is it not the time to publish Hurley's report? (7) Would forcing the Chinese government to organize a coalition government with the Communist Party not lead to China becoming a vassal state of the Soviet Union, like Poland and Yugoslavia? (8) Is the Open Door and the territorial integrity of China still our basic policy? In its letter to the State Department on July 24, the American Policy Association asked whether the U.S. government had changed its Open Door policy to a sham policy.</p>
<p>The U.S. government stated that "the deaths of four U.S. Marines in China is not the main issue," and that "the Chinese Communist Party's resistance to opening up transportation lines through Communist areas by U.S. Marines is quite justified." The letter stated: In terms of the latter point, it was agreed to by both the Chinese Communists and Marshal Marshall in the January 10 agreement.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 10th] Regarding the joint statement by Marshall and Ambassador Stuart stating that it was impossible to mediate the Chinese war, the State Department stated that this news has not been confirmed. A spokesman said: No official criticism will be made until the State Department has confirmed this statement. Congressional reactions to the statement were mixed, with some saying "U.S. troops should withdraw from China as soon as possible"; others suggested that the U.S. should take "stronger action" to "clarify the overall situation in China."</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 10th] This afternoon, the local newspapers suddenly published a joint statement by Marshal Marshall and Ambassador Stuart, which was tantamount to admitting the failure of their peace mission in China, but the newspapers did not immediately comment on it.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Yangzhou, 11th] The CCP is attempting to sabotage the Nanjing-Shanghai railway. More than 600 armed sabotage team members have been scattered in Wuxi, Shitangtan, Yixing, and other places, waiting for opportunities to act. Xue Bin, the CCP Sunan Action Army, is currently strengthening sabotage work in the Maoshan area and has also formed assassination squads. These squads are divided into four groups, each with six or seven members, all equipped with short guns, lurking in Danyang, Jin and other places, secretly operating.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Lanzhou, 11th] It is learned here that Mao Zedong recently instructed CCP cadres that the so-called "important tasks at present" include two items: (1) CCP personnel lurking in Nationalist Party areas, if their work has a considerable foundation, should create incidents under absolutely favorable conditions and take the opportunity to riot, but this riot must be covered up to avoid exposure. (2) Actively expand the number of self-defense militia to strive for the goal of reaching four million troops, and strictly strengthen the militia's combat training.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 10th] Communist troops in Dongtai and Xinghua have recently forcibly conscripted 20 able-bodied men, 15 women, and 12 children from each village in various townships, causing public resistance.

<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 11th] The Nanjing Christian Association held a celebration service for the anniversary of the victory of the War of Resistance at Hanzhong Church at 4 p.m. on the 11th. U.S. Ambassador Dr. Stuart delivered a sermon, with more than a thousand people attending. The ambassador wore a simple white summer suit and spoke in fluent Chinese. He first stated that during his three years and eight months of detention by the Japanese in Ping, he deeply felt the preciousness of freedom. To save mankind from suffering, the key is to avoid war and killing, and to gradually form a world state (World State) among all countries in the world. The ambassador believes that the anniversary of the victory has arrived, but the contradictions and conflicts among the Allied countries still inevitably exist. He often thinks that the Allied countries should gradually form a world state. Before this dream is realized, the people of all countries must first have a global perspective. The ambassador said: "The world state cannot be achieved by the rulers and leaders of a few countries alone. Its formation lies in the people of each country automatically developing a global perspective. Furthermore, it is the realization of the Datong ideal, that is, the practice of Confucius's ideal of 'all within the four seas are brothers.'" The ambassador continued: Democracy is the best of the current political systems, but if the people lack a sense of responsibility, it can also evolve into the worst political system. China is moving towards democracy, and all Christians and Chinese youth should work hard for its realization.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Washington, 10th] A State Department spokesman said: The U.S. government has sent a note to the Soviet government, urging them to pay attention to the restrictions imposed on the U.S. Consul in Dalian by the Soviet military authorities there.

<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 11th] The Capital High Court reopened the trial of Wang Yintai, the former chairman of the puppet North China Political Affairs Commission, on the 10th. Judge Ge Zhaotang served as the presiding judge, and the defendant's lawyer, Dai Xiuzan, accompanied Wang to court. He continued to submit three kinds of documents favorable to the traitor. The traitor had submitted a total of 43 rebuttals. The court first inquired about the six incidents of forcibly occupying ancient porcelain. Wang Yintai categorically denied them. The defense attorney requested the court to consider that the traitor defended Tianjin and Beijing until the enemy surrendered, stabilized the overall situation in North China to await the Central Government's takeover, and that he had made contributions to the country. However, after repeated questioning by the court regarding his participation in the puppet organization, the defendant finally admitted his mistake. The court adjourned at 12:30 p.m. The court continued at 2:50 p.m. Wang Yintai continued to submit several documents favorable to the people. The court then read a letter from a reader named Jin Shi in Beiping, which described in detail Wang Yintai's employment of personnel, administration, and private life during his tenure in the enemy puppet regime. Those who attended the hearing laughed at this, but Wang Yintai repeatedly quibbled until 5:45 p.m., when the court ordered him to collect documents and scheduled another trial for September 3.</p>

<p>[This newspaper, Hangzhou, 10th] A Qiantang River Seawall Inspection Team composed of twelve Chinese and foreign water conservancy engineering experts arrived in Hangzhou yesterday. In the afternoon, the newly appointed Director of the Seawall Engineering Bureau, Mao Yisheng, led the inspection of the Qiantang River Railway Bridge. The cement road on the upper level of the bridge had five holes blown up during the War of Resistance. The authorities urgently planned to repair it and stabilize the bridge foundation. This project will take one year and cost 110,000 yuan. It is currently awaiting allocation of funds from the Central Government. Once the funds arrive, the repair work can begin. At 8 a.m. this morning, the team, together with Chairman Shen, Construction Department Chief Pi Zuohuan, and Mao Yisheng, went to Haining Baobao to inspect the seawall repair project. There are a total of seven breaches in the Haining stone seawall, totaling more than 1,740 meters in length. Six breaches have been blocked, leaving only Zhao Wei breach. The method is to build a firewood seawall near the river, build an earthen seawall in the middle, and finally build an earthen storage seawall. The entire project requires 77,000 bundles of firewood, 100,000 workers, and 116,000 cubic meters of earth. The seawall engineering work in Haining accounts for 70% of the total, while that in Haiyan accounts for 30%. The team will go to Haiyan Zhapu tomorrow for inspection and return to Shanghai the day after tomorrow via Jiaxing. The repair project is nearing completion. The Seawall Engineering Bureau was established yesterday. After this inspection, a specific plan for the seawall can be determined. At the same time, the overall development plan for the CVA floodgate in the Qiantang River Basin will also be discussed.</p>

<p>[This newspaper, Shenyang, 11th] Wang Xiaolai told reporters that this was his first time in the Northeast and he felt the momentum was enormous. Yesterday, he visited various factories in the Tiexi District of Shenyang. Although there are only traces of destruction in this area, the outline is already amazing. It is difficult to find a second place with such a magnificent scene in the country. He and others plan to go to Sipingjie, Changchun, and Jilin on the 16th for sightseeing, and then fly back to Shanghai. After returning to Shanghai, he plans to urge the Shanghai industrial and commercial circles to organize an industrial and commercial inspection team to come to the Northeast to facilitate investment in the Northeast by people from the Southeast to restore or expand industry and commerce in the Northeast. Because many people in Shanghai are speculating in U.S. dollar speculation, speculative business is ultimately not as reliable as engaging in meaningful industry. Also, in his opinion, after the capital or manpower from the Southeast comes to the Northeast, it should start with small-scale industry and commerce, so that it can achieve greater results and succeed quickly, and then engage in the construction of large-scale industry and commerce. The future is really bright and great. Finally, talking about the relief problem, Wang said: In addition to general relief, he is also very concerned about the Mongolians and will discuss it with the Northeast Relief Association. The industrial and commercial circles and people in Shanghai will never lag behind in helping those in need.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3 id="e27">The Situation After the Marshall-Stuart Joint Statement <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>Humbly Offering Our Recommendations to the Government and the People</p>
<p>We are deeply grateful to the two friendly mediating envoys, Marshal Marshall and Ambassador Stuart, for issuing a joint statement in the capital on the afternoon of the 10th. As reported in yesterday's newspaper, the main points of this statement are threefold: (1) They have consistently been studying various possible methods to end the current conflict and are starting to reorganize the government; (2) Peace is the unanimous desire of the entire Chinese people. To avoid economic collapse, a solution to the political situation must be devised, and both the government and the Communist leaders also desire a ceasefire, but the scope of the war is expanding daily; (3) Among the issues that must be resolved immediately but have been difficult to reach an agreement on, are 1) the redeployment of troops, and 2) the nature of local governments in the areas from which troops are withdrawn.</p>
<p>When we read this dispatch the night before last, we were shocked and overwhelmed with thoughts, but we could only express a few mixed feelings of sweetness, sourness, bitterness, and spiciness. (1) The two envoys, Marshall and Stuart, are old and carry great responsibility, working tirelessly for peace in China. Although they have not yet been able to celebrate success, after peeling away the layers, only two seemingly difficult-to-agree issues remain. If they can make further progress, "sincerely investigate things," there is still light ahead. This seems sweet. (2) A year of victory, a golden age has been wasted. The Chinese cannot resolve Chinese affairs themselves, troubling allies to such an extent, and they are still unwilling to compromise for the sake of the country. When we think of our compatriots in SuBei, Anhui, and the border areas of Hubei and Henan, in the suburbs of Datong, suffering in deep water and scorching fire, how can we not feel sourness? (3) The Chinese people have suffered enough! Enduring eight years of war was not enough; they must also endure the suffering of internal strife spreading. Allies are so reluctant to come to rescue us from suffering, yet the warmongers who create internal strife, after a year of contention, insist on adding more suffering to the people. Seeing that peace is temporarily hopeless, when will the taste of bitterness end! (4) During the war, China was originally one of the "Four Powers," but later became one of the "Five Powers," with China relegated to the bottom of the Five Powers. The Moscow Conference concentrated power in the "Three Powers," and although the Paris Foreign Ministers' Conference changed the Three Powers to the "Four Powers," China was no longer among the "Four Powers," replaced by France, which had once been occupied. Every time internal strife in China expands, its international status declines; every time internal strife in China deepens, its international status weakens. We read the newspaper every day, always feeling a spiciness that makes us unable to close our mouths. We believe that the statement by Marshall and Stuart will surely increase these mixed feelings of sweetness, sourness, bitterness, and spiciness in general.</p>
<p>However, whether it is sweetness, sourness, bitterness, or spiciness, as Chinese people living in today's China, we must strive to resolve the issues of today's China. Some people believe that the Marshall-Stuart statement shows the failure of mediation efforts, even calling it a tragedy; it is also rumored that Marshal Marshall is preparing to return to the United States next month, seeming to further imply that the situation is difficult to salvage. Our view is not entirely so. First, the Marshall-Stuart statement does not explicitly state that they have failed and have no intention of further mediation.</p>
<p>Second, Reuters reports that general observations still believe that Marshal Marshall has not hinted at leaving China, and Beijing has not indicated that the situation is hopeless. Third, as pointed out in the statement, the government and the Communist leaders actually desire peace. Fourth, the trend of domestic economic collapse is forcing everyone to seek a peaceful solution. Fifth, Zhou Enlai has stated that "the seriousness of the situation is actually greater than what is said in the statement," and Wang Bingnan has stated that "the core of the problem lies in peace or war," but the CCP has not yet dared to publicly say that there will only be "war" in the future. At the same time, Chairman Chiang has stated that as long as the four main issues of ceasefire, troop reorganization, restoration of transportation, and the locations where the Communist troops will be stationed are effectively resolved, other issues can be easily resolved, showing that the door to peace is not completely closed. Sixth, and most importantly, the Chinese people, who have experienced the pain firsthand, have not yet made their greatest efforts for peace. If the people can truly propose concrete methods for achieving peace, who would dare to stubbornly refuse to comply? Therefore, we dare to say: The situation after the Marshall-Stuart joint statement is serious, but not necessarily hopeless, and there is no need to be extremely pessimistic. From now on, everything depends on what the people do.</p>
<p>To break this deadlock today, we must find a reasonable solution to the two points that Marshall and Stuart consider difficult. However, before proposing concrete methods, we must first establish three preconditions: (A) The government, the CCP, and the mediators (whether allies or Chinese people who call themselves third parties) must only use reason and not be emotional. Everyone must think about the people's livelihood and not consider the interests of parties. (B) Everyone must show sincerity and not intend to delay further, but especially needs great patience. Mencius said, "Those who do something are like digging a well; digging a well without reaching the spring is like abandoning the well." Today, the work of seeking peace for China is a thousand times more difficult than digging a well. We earnestly hope that the parties involved and the mediators must take "abandoning the well" as a warning. We still need them to show greater patience and perseverance to do the work of deliberation and refinement. (C) Everyone must jointly recognize that China is the China of the Chinese people, not a China divided by the KMT and the CCP or monopolized by one party. Therefore, how the Chinese situation should be resolved in the end can only be determined by the Chinese people. It would be good if the government and the CCP could negotiate well, but otherwise, if they each hold their own opinions and cannot reach an agreement, then the people must step forward and make the final decision. Therefore, at this stage of the Marshall-Stuart mediation, the Chinese people should quickly stand up to support them and cooperate with them to make a public judgment on this matter, and no one is allowed to violate it. It is said that Chairman Chiang will convene a national university president conference at the end of this month. We believe that it may be expanded, how can we have people represent the national opinion to express their national opinion for solving the national crisis. Now, the disease is indeed in the bone marrow, but if we can truly prescribe the right medicine, we may be able to bring the dead back to life.</p>
<p>With the preconditions established, we humbly propose the following suggestions for the survival and glory of the nation:</p>
<p>(1) The government and the CCP should first reiterate their promises to the whole country in the next few days: (1) Stop all propaganda warfare, (2) Absolutely return the government to the people (political democratization) and return the military to the country (nationalization of the army), (3) Be willing to follow the military reorganization and integration plan and effectively restore transportation. This is to establish a "sincere" foundation for future negotiations.</p>
<p>(2) The government should announce its troop redeployment plan, designate the area where the Communist troops will be relocated, and report the extent of the implementation of the troop reorganization that has been carried out in the past; at the same time, the Communist Party can also provide its redeployment plan, the area it is willing to relocate to, and report the extent of its past reorganization. This is to provide the people with information that can be used for public judgment.</p>
<p>(3) After the above two items are completed, the government should, in accordance with the example of the recent 20-day ceasefire in the Central Plains area, immediately issue an order for a general ceasefire throughout the country for 20 days or one month. At the same time, the Military Mediation Department should instruct all groups to immediately go to the conflict areas to supervise and enforce this ceasefire order.</p>
<p>(4) At the same time, the government should convene a more representative national conference or talks in the capital or Lushan, and invite Marshall Marshall and the original mediators and the three members of the Military Mediation Department to participate in the conference or talks as observers. The participants should include (1) the Standing Committee members of the Kuomintang Central Committee, (2) the Standing Committee members of the Communist Party Central Committee, (3) the Standing Committee members of the Youth Party, (3) the Standing Committee members of the State Socialist Party (whether it has been renamed is another question), (5) the Standing Committee members of the Democratic League, (6) the Speakers of the National Political Council, (8) the presidents of universities, (9) the Standing Committee members of the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce Preparatory Committee, (10) the Standing Directors of the National Industrial Association, (11) the presidents or chief editors of major national newspapers (including Liberation Daily and Xinhua Daily) and news agencies (including Xinhua News Agency), (12) the Standing Directors who can represent national agricultural and industrial groups, and other leaders who can represent religious and social groups. News reporters can be allowed to attend this meeting as observers. The government and the CCP should sincerely state their concrete methods and reasons for resolving the situation, and openly discuss the military reorganization and integration plan, and the reasons why it has not been effectively implemented, and listen to everyone's calm and rational discussion before making a fair and reasonable decision. Not only should the method of permanently stopping the conflict be determined, but also how to effectively reduce the army, how to reorganize the government to expand its democratic foundation, how to convene the National Assembly on schedule, and how to discuss the main points of the constitution can be decided in this conference or talks with national significance. This is truly the supreme method for the Chinese to meet each other with sincerity and for all time.</p>
<p>(5) If the Lushan Conference in the autumn of the 26th year of the Republic of China is considered a conference that decided on the War of Resistance, then the Lushan Conference mentioned above can be said to be a conference that decides on nation-building. Its relationship to China's future is too important. If the Communist Party truly loves the country, it should participate in this conference. As long as the Communist Party can sincerely participate, and the government and the CCP are willing to listen to the opinions of the people and follow the public judgment of the people, not only is there an absolute guarantee of peace in China, but China can also make a leap forward miracle on the road to nation-building. To this day, we believe that the greatest regret is that in the process of negotiations between the government and the CCP over the past year, they have always relied on a few parties and ignored or even forgotten the broad masses of the people! They do not know that today, without the power of the people, it may not be possible to resolve the Chinese situation. If any party refuses to participate in this conference or talks, or does not comply with the decision of this conference or talks, it is tantamount to cutting itself off from the Chinese people. The people must judge right and wrong to help the party that complies with the people's decision to achieve China's democratic unity, and no force should be allowed to obstruct and undermine it.</p>
<p>Readers should not doubt the slow and difficult nature of our proposal; if everyone is sincere and practical, the overall situation in China can be resolved within two months, and the clouds can be cleared to see the blue sky. We think that Marshall and Stuart are currently suffering from being at a loss, so how can the Chinese people still stand by and watch, only sighing under the bean vines and melon racks, or only saying some seemingly neutral cool words? To be honest, the reason why the Chinese situation has been so bad over the past year is that the deep-seated prejudices of the Kuomintang and the CCP are one reason, and some so-called "village good men" who call themselves "neutralists" must also bear part of the responsibility. These "neutralists" do not understand the principle of "being in the middle," and especially do not know the wonderful use of "weighing the pros and cons, weighing the urgency, and weighing the right and wrong," truly committing the fault that Mencius said, "Holding the middle without weighing is like holding one; what is hated about holding one is that it harms the way." Thus, they only know "I am neutral," "I want to be impartial," and they do not ask about right and wrong at all. They think that this way they will not be involved in the whirlpool of right and wrong, and that this way they can please both sides with the word "neutrality." They have no opinions of their own. What is this if not "village good men"? Confucius said, "If someone passes our door without entering our room, I would not regret it, except for the village good men! Village good men are the thieves of virtue!" Mencius further explained that they are "disliked, but there is nothing to criticize; attacked, but there is nothing to attack; they conform to the customs of the world, and they are in harmony with the corrupt world; they live as if they are loyal and trustworthy, and they act as if they are honest and clean; everyone is pleased with them, and they think they are right, but they cannot enter the way of Yao and Shun." Today, we Chinese people must stand up as masters of the country who judge right and wrong, and we must not be village good men-style neutralists who please both sides and are "pleasing to all." Only when the Chinese people change this fundamental attitude will the Chinese situation have a day of rapid and sudden improvement!</p>

<p>Nehru and the Party View the Indonesian War</p>
<p>[Associated Press Dispatch from Warda, India, 11th] The Indian National Congress Executive Committee formally notified the Muslim League today, asking it to reconsider its withdrawal from participating in the British-proposed Indian independence plan. Informed sources believe that this move by the Congress Party is the first step in attempting to form a provisional government. Since the Muslim League expressed its non-cooperation in establishing a provisional government, only the Congress Party supports the British proposal. It is rumored that the British government will request the Congress Party to start organizing a provisional government. The Congress Party Executive Committee also passed a resolution stating that the Congress Party did not accept all the proposals in the British plan, but accepted them in general. Congress Party leader Nehru once declared: We should remember that while we are striving for independence, our brothers and sisters in Indonesia are also fighting to maintain their independence and protect their new republic. Nehru then commented on the air war in Java, because the Netherlands is planning to destroy the Indonesian Republic in Java. It is said that he proposed holding a conference of representatives from Southeast Asian countries in January or February to discuss preserving each other's unity and making relations between countries closer.</p>

<h3 id="e35">The Palestine Question; Britain Plans to Clarify its Policy in a Declaration; The US Proposes a Compromise Plan; Soviet Newspapers Write Articles Criticizing London; Arab Countries Held a Conference in Egypt Yesterday <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters Dispatch from Washington, 10th] Reliable sources say that the State Department has now drafted a compromise plan to resolve the Palestine issue, in order to eliminate the differences between Britain and the United States on the partition plan for Palestine. British Foreign Secretary Bevin and US Secretary of State Bernas, who are now in Paris, will discuss this plan this weekend. It is expected that President Truman and the British government can reach a final agreement on the revised plan. It is reported that this compromise plan has been approved by Acting Secretary of State Acheson and submitted to President Truman for consideration. The content is still based on the principle of the partition plan, but it proposes several important revisions.</p>
<p>[Associated Press Dispatch from London, 10th] Britain is awaiting President Truman's decision on the Palestine federal plan. Today, an informal order was issued to the fleet to prepare to intercept, search, and capture any ships carrying Jewish people illegally to the Holy Land. Downing Street, the Prime Minister's residence, has drafted the main points of Britain's policy on Palestine as follows: (1) Take measures in various parts of Europe to prevent Jewish people from illegally immigrating to Palestine. (2) Block the Mediterranean Sea, intercept, search, and capture illegal immigrant ships. (3) Establish shelters on the British island of Cyprus in the Eastern Mediterranean to temporarily accommodate illegal immigrants. (4) Ask countries with sparse populations in the world to absorb European refugees as much as possible in order to relieve the burden on Palestine. According to the Palestine news, the British army has prepared to enter the third stage of action. The first stage is said to be "preparing the state" to deal with any possible terrorism by the people, and the second stage is only "defensive" in nature to protect lives. The third stage will take "offensive" actions. British government officials said: The British army in Palestine is ready to deal with the "major developments" in the Holy Land.</p>
<p>[Reuters Dispatch from Alexandria, 10th] The foreign ministers of the Arab countries will arrive here on the weekend to hold a meeting to discuss the Palestine issue in order to determine the attitude of the Arab people towards the statements made by Britain and the United States on this issue. This meeting was convened by the Arab League at the request of Egypt.</p>
<p>[Associated Press Dispatch from Paris, 10th] A telegram from Cairo said that the Imam of Jerusalem, Huseini, told Pei Huseini and other Muslim leaders in Palestine that he had been placed under house arrest by Egyptian Prime Minister Sidky, and Sidky had banned him from expressing his opinions. The failure of Sidky and the Imam is due to the differences in their views on the Palestine issue.</p>
<p>[Associated Press Dispatch from Moscow, 10th] Today's "News" newspaper discussed Britain's Palestine policy, saying: The plan to divide Palestine into four districts is Britain's attempt to evade its responsibility for Jewish immigration. This policy is just adding fuel to the fire. According to the plan, the highest power is still in the hands of the British authorities, but only part of the power is transferred to the local authorities. In other words, it still maintains its control over Palestine's political, economic, and military strategy.</p>

<h3 id="e39">France Proposes Counter-Suggestion for Unifying German Occupation Zone Economy; Disagrees with U.S. Partial Merger Method <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 10th] The French government announced today that it cannot agree with the U.S. proposal for a partial merger of the German occupation zone economy. General Pierre Koenig, commander of the French occupation forces, also submitted a compromise plan to the Control Council in Berlin. It proposes that a committee composed of representatives from the relevant countries be organized to coordinate all transportation, communications, banking, industry, agriculture, foreign trade, and pricing matters in the four occupation zones. This committee should operate under the Control Council. Germans may be included in the committee, but their authority should be limited to that of consultants or executors of orders.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 10th] Today, during the Allied Control Council meeting, France responded to the U.S. plan to merge the German occupation zones by proposing several counter-suggestions, one of which advocates that the Allied Central Economic Bureau should not apply to the Saar region. The UK believes that this counter-suggestion contains no new ideas and that the Adjustment Committee had already discussed this issue last autumn. The UK agrees with the U.S. position that employing German personnel to carry out unified economic matters can proceed smoothly. The USSR has not expressed an opinion, and the matter has been submitted to the Adjustment Committee for study.</p>

<p>[United Press, New York, 10th] Mrs. Qin, the sole female representative of China at the United Nations Health Conference and a nutrition expert, stated that China's food problem is complex. Inconvenient transportation and a lack of modern agricultural methods and machinery are all contributing factors. However, another significant factor is that the Chinese public is unaware of which foods are beneficial to health and which are not. Regardless of wealth, the Chinese people generally have the same poor eating habits. The wealthy eat four or five times a day, while the poor eat only once or twice.</p>

Former U.S. Army Air Forces Commander General Henry H. Arnold once stated that all B-29 aircraft dispatched by the U.S. destroyed 68 Japanese industrial centers, and that Superfortresses carrying atomic bombs could accomplish this task in one day, or even exceed its achievements. There are approximately one hundred cities in Japan with a population of over 30,000.</p>

<p>[United Press, Geneva, 10th] The UNRRA Policy Committee discussed the transfer of UNRRA relief operations to United Nations agencies today, but no agreement was reached and the meeting adjourned. Discussions are scheduled to continue on the 12th.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 10th] The U.S. proposal at the UNRRA General Assembly in Geneva to end UNRRA operations has left countries within the Soviet sphere of influence feeling abandoned. Since the end of the war, UNRRA has shipped 2,367,542 tons of food and 208,213 tons of clothing to Albania, Belarus, Ukraine, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland, and Yugoslavia. With the exception of Albania and Hungary, all of these countries participated in the Paris Peace Conference, and all have voted in unison with the Soviet Union to oppose the termination plan of UNRRA's largest donors, the U.S. and the UK. The U.S. contribution of 2.7 billion USD accounts for 70% of UNRRA funding. Half of UNRRA's relief supplies are provided to countries within the Soviet sphere of influence, with only 14 countries receiving UNRRA assistance in total.</p>
<h3 id="e49">Ernest Bevin: The British Giant Attending the Peace Conference, Is Clement Attlee's Great Assistant, And Is Vyacheslav Molotov's Nemesis <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>In physique and will, Bevin is a giant. He will not bow his head before any strong wind, nor will he be swayed by any force. If someone thinks that he regards the Soviet Union as an equal opponent without any respect and defends certain British foreign policies, it indicates that he has been influenced by right-wing forces. Such a person can be said to completely misunderstand his character and the entire background of British politics. Certainly, at every diplomatic conference, he is almost always Molotov's arch-enemy, because both of them are outspoken and uncompromising. Bevin's voice is thunderous, and his eloquence is unrestrained, often leaving even the most articulate Molotov at a loss for words. However, this does not indicate that he is a right-leaning thinker. The fact that the British people chose the Labour Party in the election shows that their left-leaning attitude has not changed in the slightest.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, Bevin's foreign policy is his own, and it stems from his unwavering left-wing perspective. This may be difficult for some to understand, not only foreigners but also British people. But as long as we understand the background of the development of the British left wing, it will seem very natural.</p>
<p>This background can be divided into two parts. On the one hand, there is the working-class labor movement, originating from various industrial unions. Two equally important leading figures in this movement are Bevin and Morrison. This group believes in the slogan of the French Revolution, "Liberty, Equality, Fraternity," which is also known as the "pursuit of life, liberty, and happiness" in the American Declaration of Independence. They hope that everyone can speak freely, that their talents and strengths should be respected regardless of their social background, and that they should share in their due share of the wealth created by their own labor.</p>
<p>Since the last World War, this group has been at odds with the Communist Party for three reasons: First, the Communist Party has always tried to divide the left wing in politics and trade unions, causing them to waste a lot of time, energy, and money. Second, communism, both in theory and in practice in the Soviet Union, is opposed to free trade unionism, and they are more actively trying to eliminate this branch of the left wing than any right-wing group. Third, and perhaps most profound, is that people who grew up in poverty fear any form of insecurity, so they prefer moderate reforms to the revolution desired by the Communist Party. Therefore, the labor movement of this branch has always criticized the Soviet Union, which is why Bevin and Vyshinsky were so often at odds.</p>
<p>The other part can be said to be the labor movement of the propertied class, the most important of which is Sir Stafford Cripps, a descendant of a landed aristocracy. This movement was founded by his aunt, Beatrice Webb (i.e., Lady Webb). Mr. and Mrs. Webb and several friends organized a society for social reform. The members are mainly middle-class people. These people do not demand "the pursuit of life, liberty, and happiness" because they already have these things. They are people of order and have a certain degree of ambition to eliminate disorder in one fell swoop and reform the social institutions of England so that they can harmonize with the changes since the Industrial Revolution and create a strict planned economy.</p>
<p>This thinking deserves our highest respect, because it is indeed essential to harmonize. Mrs. Webb and her group are also devout and capable people. In the Soviet Union, they saw the realization of their ideals. At the same time, they were very pleased that the results of the Bolsheviks were quite satisfactory and enabled government leaders to reform the Communist Party's activities did not interfere with their labor movement organizations, and they themselves had never experienced this kind of insecurity in their lives, which would make them afraid of the revolution. Therefore, they have always given full support to the Soviet Union. This is the case now, and it will probably be the case in the future.</p>
<p>Anyone who thinks that Bevin must have abandoned his earlier ideas before dealing with Molotov either does not understand the division of these two backgrounds of the British left wing or has classified Bevin into another camp.</p>
<p>Bevin's attitude is dignified and serious, with a sense of integrity. He never looks for excuses to forgive himself; he only deals with problems one by one directly. And in the United Nations, he also solved the fundamental problems of all problems. I once asked an American journalist, "What is your impression of the United Nations?" He replied, "My most profound impression is that everything is done on stage, and there is no need to explore any behind-the-scenes secret activities." Because of Bevin's straightforward and frank attitude in the first General Assembly of the United Nations, he has kicked the despicable secret diplomacy of the Tehran and Yalta Conferences to the skies. This is Bevin's style of dealing with people.</p>

<h3 id="e50">Zhao Family Archway in Nanshi; Ming Dynasty Tombs Excavated and Destroyed; Descendants of Yan Song's Adopted Son, Zhao Wenhua, Impoverished and Selling Ancestral Tombs, Calamity Befalls Bones; Grave Robbery of Burial Objects; Lu Ni Also Involved; Eight Men and Women Have Been Arrested for Strict Investigation <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent] The Penglai Road Police Station in Nanshi cracked a major case of illegally excavating ancient tombs and stealing burial antiques the day before yesterday. The tombs are hundreds of years old, belonging to Zhao Wenhua, adopted son of Yan Song in the late Ming Dynasty, who was a right-wing Zheng Tongsui official. The antiques inside were all embezzled by the "Police Chief" Ying and the "Branch Chief" Jiang Ziyun of Zhonghua Road during the enemy-puppet period. Eight main male and female criminals have now been arrested, and old rifles, bullets, steel helmets, Japanese military uniforms, etc., have been seized. The witnesses were transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for trial this morning. It is reported that Shen Hanlin, who committed many evils during the enemy-puppet period and lives at 441 Jiangyin Street, is a shoemaker. Due to the suspicion of privately purchasing military fire, he was arrested by Police Section Staff Sun Hao and Fu Zhaoxu, led by plainclothes police officer Wang Yimin, at midnight on the 7th of this month. A broken rifle, more than 20 bullets, Japanese military uniforms, and a lawyer's announcement sign for the relocation of ancestral tombs were found. After the witnesses were taken to the police station, Branch Chief Yao Qihong ordered Criminal Section Chief Yao Yuanlong to investigate. According to the confession, on July 5th, 1944, Shen Hanlin participated in the illegal excavation of the tomb of Zhao Wenhua, adopted son of Yan Song in the late Ming Dynasty, located at the Zhao Family Archway on Dalin Road inside Xiaoximen (who was beheaded and buried there after serving as a right-wing Zheng Tongsui official), because Zhao Wang, the widow of Zhao Wenhua, and Zhao Xiaomei, a sister-in-law, sold the tomb land to Huang Xiji due to poverty for 140,000 in currency. However, the buyer insisted on relocating the tomb before paying the money. Therefore, Zhao Wang and others entrusted Rong Wanxiang, a gravedigger also known as She Tou, who specialized in flipping dead bodies at the Nanshi Funeral Home, to hire workers to excavate. Two coffins made of Phoebe nanmu wood were found on the spot, one of which was Zhao Wenhua's coffin. A large number of antiques were found in the coffin, such as jade bracelets, jadeite, jade rings, gold fan crowns, gold hairpins, pearls, beaded flowers, earrings, etc. At that time, Jiang Ziyun, the "Deputy Police Chief" of the "Puppet Zhonghua Road Branch", sent "Inspector" Li Jihua, a puppet officer, to supervise the scene. All the antiques that were unearthed were taken away. Except for a gold fan and two dragon and phoenix jade rings, which were offered to "Police Chief" Ying, another gold fan was swallowed by Pang Zilin, a "puppet officer" of the branch, and the rest were taken by Jiang Ziyun. Branch Chief Yao then ordered the original police officers to bring seven people, including Gu Zilin, Zhao Xiaomei, Zhao Wang, Zhang Rongsheng, Li Jihua, Zhao Ahu, and Rong Wanxiang, to the station for investigation separately. According to Zhao Xiaomei's confession, she had an affair with "Inspector" Li Jihua, and Li Jihua handled the matter of bribing Police Chief Ying. Zhang Rongsheng was a rickshaw puller and also participated in the excavation of the tomb at that time. All the antiques and other items were loaded into his cart and transported elsewhere. Other suspects also confessed. Jiang Ziyun, the main criminal who is still at large, is currently being strictly investigated.</p>

<p>On August 11, 1938, the lone army of the 88th Division inside Jiaozhou Park was massacred by White Russian soldiers for requesting to hang a flag in commemoration of the first anniversary of their departure from Wuxi. Yesterday morning at 10:00, led by the widow of former Commander Xie, a memorial ceremony was held in Jin Yuan Park. Many guests, including Chairman Wu Shaoshu, attended, and wreaths from all walks of life were piled up next to the tomb. Recalling the historical traces of the lone army's resistance against Japan, people paid their respects with tears. During the memorial ceremony, the widow of former Commander Xie described in detail the lone army's struggle and stated that on August 11, 1937, nine years ago today, the 88th Division departed from Wuxi to defend Shanghai. Two days later, the "August 13th" battle broke out. After three months of fierce fighting, 800 brave soldiers retreated into Jiaozhou Park under the leadership of former Commander Xie. A year later, to commemorate their departure, they hung a flag and were brutally massacred by the White Russian police officers of the Public Works Department, resulting in the martyrdom of lone army comrades Liu Shangcai, You Changqing, Wu Zude, and Wang Wenyi for the national flag. Chairman Wu then reported on the circumstances in which the underground workers and former Commander Xie fought against the enemy and puppet regime in the same difficult environment at that time. The listeners were all moved to tears. The ceremony ended at around 12:00. (The photo shows Chairman Wu (left) and Mrs. Xie (right) during the memorial ceremony. Photo by China News Agency.)</p>

<p>The Shanghai Municipal Party Department held the inauguration of the first Party Affairs Training Class and the eleventh New Party Member Oath Ceremony at the Municipal Gymnasium at 9:30 am yesterday. More than 1,500 new party members and 180 cadres and students of the training class attended. After leading the ceremony, Chen Baohua, the Secretary-General of the Municipal Party Department, was followed by Mayor Wu giving instructions, stating that the Party must pay attention to two things in the future: First, sincere unity among comrades to maintain the glorious history of the past and carry it forward; second, to strengthen local efforts. It is necessary to make all compatriots in the country believe that only the Kuomintang can clarify politics and create benefits for the people everywhere, so as to complete the great cause of the Party's revolution and nation-building. Subsequently, all the new party members took an oath under the leadership of Lu Entan, the Director of the Organization and Training Department of the Municipal Party Department. Chairman Wu Shaoshu of the Municipal Government acted as the overseer on behalf of the higher-level party department, and delivered a speech to the students and new party members. Mr. Wu read three important points from the Director-General's instructions to party members and members: (1) Every party member should practice what they preach; (2) Pay special attention to unity among comrades; (3) The essence of revolutionary philosophy lies in recognizing that the purpose of life is to improve the well-being of all mankind, and the meaning of life lies in creating the continuation of cosmic life. All our party members must practice living for the revolution, dying for the revolution, and devoting ourselves to the end. At the end, Chairman Wu issued party certificates, and Secretary Chen led the reading of the party member code of conduct. At 11:00, the General Assembly announced the completion of the ceremony.

<h3 id="e55">Paper Birds Soaring in the Wind: Model Airplane Competition Held Enthusiastically Yesterday <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>[Our Own Reporter] With the August 14th Air Force Day approaching, the Chinese Aviation Construction Association, the Air Force Headquarters, and other organizations jointly held a model airplane competition at Hongqiao Airport yesterday. Around 9:00 yesterday morning, the long-desolate, weed-strewn Hongqiao Airport was packed with spectators, numbering nearly a thousand. The participants, mostly students from various large, medium, and small schools, numbered over 230. The flight competition was divided into seven categories: (1) Catapult Gliders, with 9 participants; (2) Hand-Launched Gliders, with 13 participants; (3) Pylon-Towed Gliders, with 13 participants; (4) Fuselage-Towed Gliders, with 25 participants; (5) Pylon-Rubber Band Powered Models, with 89 participants; (6) Fuselage-Rubber Band Powered Models, with 69 participants; (7) Gasoline-Powered Models, with 7 participants.</p>
<p>During each category's competition, the groups were simultaneously divided into four groups: Red, Green, White, and Yellow. Each group was spaced over thirty feet apart, with a colored flag marking their area. Four to five referees were responsible for timing and other duties. The competition was based on flight time to determine the design and performance of the models. Before the competition, each model underwent a rigorous inspection by graduates of the Jiaotong University Aviation Engineering Department, who measured them to ensure they met international standards. The competition began around 10:00 a.m. The participating youth held their handmade models high and took off in turn. For a time, paper birds crisscrossed the blue sky and white clouds, creating a spectacular sight. The model airplanes participating in the competition were almost entirely made of paper and wooden sticks. Very few had entirely wooden fuselages. The light paper and the wind speed of about twelve miles per hour caused many models to flutter uncontrollably after takeoff. The pylon-towed models were the most spectacular, rising against the wind to a height of over fifty feet before releasing the towline, after which the model circled and descended, gliding a great distance. It is said that the highest gliding record in the Chongqing competition was over forty minutes. According to Professor Yang Pengji of the Jiaotong University Aviation Engineering Department, the chief referee at yesterday's event, the materials in Shanghai are superior to those in the interior, and the designs are excellent, so the national record may be broken. However, the exact records and the rankings of the winners in each category will not be announced until the calculations are completed in the next few days. The entire competition ended at 5:00 p.m. yesterday.</p>
<p>[Another Report] At approximately 11:00 a.m. yesterday, U.S. Air Force Second Transport Group Captain Dahl, accompanied by two teammates, brought a self-made fuselage gasoline model to the airport for demonstration. The wingspan of the yellow model was approximately one foot. It was a true-to-life model of a Ryan-style monoplane trainer, equipped with a miniature gasoline engine, reportedly newly shipped from the United States. It was said to be able to fly at a speed of seventy-five miles per hour for fifteen minutes. The plane attempted to take off twice, but failed due to the plywood runway, which was both too short and uneven. The first time, the propeller broke when it collided with the ground just seven meters from the end of the runway. The second time, the newly replaced propeller was too small and lacked sufficient thrust, so it also failed to take off.</p>

<p>[This Newspaper Report] Amidst the flurry of municipal senators reporting for duty, lawyer Duanmu Kai, elected senator for the Dachang District, suddenly announced to reporters yesterday: He had never intended to accept the position, so he would not attend the inaugural meeting on the 13th. He stated: Having been away from Shanghai for nearly a decade, he was inevitably out of touch with the city's situation. He has already been elected as a National Political Council member and cannot attend to both. Therefore, he wrote to the Civil Affairs Bureau on July 26th, stating his position. Answering reporters' inquiries, he said that the reason he was unable to clearly state his position earlier was that the validity of the municipal senator election had not yet been determined. Now that he knows the election is valid, he should declare that he will not accept the position, so that a substitute candidate can be appointed. It is further reported: Duanmu's resignation has been approved, and candidate senator Zhu Wenbin has been selected to substitute according to law.</p>

<p>Housing Management Committee Will Be the Sole Agency, Requesting Courts to Send Personnel to Handle Cases Jointly</p>
<p>Director Wu of the Housing Rental Management Committee informed reporters yesterday that the government has passed amendments to the Housing Dispute Resolution Measures, which will be sent to the Executive Yuan for approval within days. Approval is expected to be problem-free. At that time, the Housing Management Committee will become the sole agency for adjudicating all housing disputes, and the courts will be requested to send personnel to participate and handle cases jointly. Regarding the future new work of the Housing Management Committee, the first step will be to investigate the rental relationships in the city over the years to clarify whether there are any illegal rental relationships (such as using gold bars to secure housing), in order to take steps to ban them. The elimination of second landlords is a consistent goal of the Housing Management Committee, so as to gradually establish a direct relationship between third tenants and the primary landlord, eliminating intermediate exploitation. The next task is to investigate vacant houses in the city. If vacant houses are found, they will be forced to be rented out to alleviate the housing shortage. Regarding the construction of affordable housing, it is said that due to financial difficulties, it has not yet become concrete.</p>

<p>[This Newspaper Report] Zhang Zhiben, the leader of the investigation team for the takeover work, told our reporter yesterday: The reports from the various takeover agencies have all been submitted, and all the committee members have reviewed them. Judging from the reports alone, the takeover work is generally good and without any problems. Therefore, the investigation team is currently collecting materials and evidence from the side to achieve the purpose of the investigation. Team leader Zhang specifically pointed out that our country's long-standing "reimbursement policy" reverses right and wrong and is extremely harmful. The authorities often only consider the rationality of the reimbursement as a test of the work. Therefore, those who are good but not good at reimbursement are wronged, while mediocre and corrupt people use the cleverness of reimbursement to be praised by the authorities. Team leader Zhang gave an example and said: The investigation team's investigation policy focuses on collecting materials from multiple sources and listening to opinions from multiple sources, and will never trust "reimbursement accounts." When asked whether the fifty-day deadline could complete the mission, Team leader Zhang replied: If we step up our work, fifty days is not short. If the work is slack, even a hundred days is not enough, so the team does not plan to extend the deadline for the work.</p>

<p>[This Newspaper Report] Under the leadership of musician Aiyi Galomov, the China Musical Theater is still rushing to rehearse these days despite the recent sweltering heat. The repertoires that have been rehearsed include "Meng Jiangnu," "Five Planets," and "Rippling Heartstrings." It is said that a large part of "Rippling Heartstrings" is adapted from the Beijing opera "Fisherman's Revenge." It is also reported that the troupe is scheduled to go abroad in mid-October, with a total of more than 30 people, including actors and staff. Among them, the famous dancer Wang Yuan has signed a contract with the troupe, with a very low salary. During the rehearsal period, she receives a monthly subsidy of 100 US dollars for transportation and meals. After going to the United States, it will increase to 150 US dollars. Also, because Wang Yuan suffers from heart disease, she can no longer continue with strenuous Western dance. The performances she participates in with the troupe are only gentle Chinese dances. The famous performers Bai Yuwei and Li Shifang have been hired by the troupe and may go to the United States to participate in the performance. They have already participated in rehearsals. Last Monday, they showed off their skills at Yiyuan. Li Shifang performed a section from "Farewell My Concubine," and Bai Yuwei performed with ribbons. It is also said that their remuneration is planned by the troupe to be 800 US dollars, but Bai Yuwei said that she is not satisfied, so whether it will happen is still difficult to decide.</p>

<h3 id="e95">Questions and Answers on Household Registration Laws and Regulations (Second Series) <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>(52) Question: Article 19 of the Household Registration Law stipulates that household registration should be registered in accordance with the number assigned by the autonomous region within the jurisdictional area. Does this autonomous region refer to the Baojia system?</p>
<p>Answer: The Household Registration Law was promulgated in the 20th year of the Republic of China, and Article 3 stipulates that the township area of a county and the fang area of a city are the jurisdictional areas. Therefore, the autonomous regional division within the jurisdictional area stipulated in Article 19 refers to the Lu Lin within the townships and fangs before the implementation of the Household Registration Law. Since the promulgation of the County-Level Organization Outline in Article 28 and the Municipal Organization Law in the 32nd year, the names of Fang, Ban, and Lin no longer exist. In the future, household registration and personnel registration should temporarily use the township of the county and the district of the city as the jurisdictional area.</p>
<p>(53) Question: The Household Registration Law does not provide for receipts for reading fees, copying fees, and fines. Which agency should formulate them, what format should they be, and what should this income be used for?</p>
<p>Answer: The county government can formulate and issue the format itself. Since the amount of this fee is not much, it can be allocated to the township office for household administration expenses, but it must be reported to the county government for approval before it can be used.</p>

<h3 id="e97">The Issue of Factory Closures Is Under Meticulous Study <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Since the industrial and commercial crisis has become increasingly profound, some companies have adopted austerity policies, laying off employees and reducing their scope in an attempt to barely survive. Others have taken decisive measures, such as closing factories or stores, to avoid depleting their expenses. In the past month or so, such events have increased daily, and companies have reported to the authorities for record-keeping or requested instructions on how to deal with the remaining employees after the factory closure. It is heard that the authorities are handling this matter with extreme caution. Currently, the unemployment problem is very serious, and they are trying their best to resettle unemployed workers who have come to Shanghai from this city and the rear. Although the Temporary Relief Committee for Unemployed Workers established after the victory has expired, they will find ways to reorganize it and continue to provide relief. To maintain social stability, employed workers must not be allowed to become unemployed. However, it is also a fact that most of these factories and companies are unable to sustain themselves. Moreover, industries and businesses are free to close voluntarily for certain reasons under the law. According to the new Company Law, if the capital is depleted to one-third and the shareholders' meeting is not convened to discuss whether to continue or stop, the board of directors and staff are responsible. Therefore, whether to approve their opening and closing of factories and stores, and how to dismiss all employees after the factory closure, are currently under meticulous study.</p>
<h3 id="e98">The Ministry of Economic Affairs Stipulates Factory Registration Measures <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>Since the revised factory registration regulations were promulgated on March 25th of the 30th year of the Republic of China, most factories have registered according to law, but there are still many that have not registered. After the victory, there were even more changes in factories in various places, and the Ministry of Economic Affairs urgently needs to understand all the changes. Therefore, it recently instructed the Municipal Government to supervise the Social Affairs Bureau to comply with the following three regulations: (1) Whether newly established or old, all factories that have not received a registration certificate from the Ministry of Economic Affairs should quickly fill out a registration form and submit it to the Ministry of Economic Affairs for verification and issuance of a registration certificate. (2) Regardless of whether registered or unregistered, all factories should report the types and amounts of products from the previous year, as well as the production plans for this year and the next year, truthfully to the Ministry. (3) All factories that have a registration certificate from the Ministry of Economic Affairs and have suspended operations should submit the original certificate to the Ministry for cancellation. Those that have temporarily resumed operations should also state the reasons and report to the Ministry.</p>
<h3 id="e99">Rayon Prices Rise Steadily, but Unable to Surge <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>Rayon had a smooth week last week, rising daily. Bullish companies were buying, and manufacturers had actual sales, so that prices rose by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan per day. On Thursday, 120 Tianqiao rose by as much as 80,000 to 90,000 yuan. At the beginning of the week, it was within the 500,000 yuan range, and by the weekend it was 630,000 yuan, a total increase of 140,000 to 150,000 yuan. Miscellaneous 120 glossy followed Tianqiao. 150 glossy and 120 semi-glossy were less expensive due to sluggish sales, rising by about 30,000 to 40,000 yuan last week. 75 Golden Rooster semi-glossy also rose sharply, starting at 460,000 to 470,000 yuan at the beginning of the week and reaching 1,060,000 yuan on Saturday. Factory warp market conditions were relatively quiet at the beginning of last week, but improved slightly at the weekend. Each warp rose by 50,000 to 100,000 yuan. Silk fabrics lingered in a state of fatigue. Meiya's prices rose sharply by 20,000 to 30,000 yuan, while Dacheng's plaid [fabrics] were no longer in season and could not rise, ending at around 4,600 yuan with extremely rare transactions. Huajin crepe had some inquiries and followed the raw materials to rise, starting within the 2,000 yuan range at the beginning of the week and reaching 2,100 yuan by the weekend. Currently, autumn sales of silk fabrics have not yet moved, and all manufacturers are exhausted under the pressure of high wages and high interest rates. The establishment of a silk industry bank and the provision of small loans to silk merchants will provide some small assistance to silk merchants.</p>
<h3 id="e100">The Bean and Rice Industry Standardizes Bushels Yesterday <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>In order to facilitate the loading and unloading of rice grains for merchants, the bean and rice industry in this city has restored the system of using bushels of rice. It specially requested the approval of the Rice Grain Industry Association and the Changshu Rice Industry Association. Yesterday morning at 10 o'clock, the first standardization of bushels was held at the Xie Youlue Zuxiu Hall. More than 200 rice bushels were sent by the rice shops for standardization. The Bushel Division Union sent many Bushel Masters to inspect each one, and then stamped the characters "Fu" (five he), "Lu" (three he), "Shou" (two he), "Xi" (one he), "Qing" (half he) and other symbols of happiness and longevity, and pasted the autumn standardization vouchers. All the bushels were standardized by 4 PM.</p>
<p>Consolidate New Instruments and Eliminate Old Instruments</p>
<p>The implementation of weights and measures in Shanghai had a rough framework before the war. Unfortunately, it was completely destroyed after the incident. The Social Affairs Bureau restored the Inspection Institute in March of this year. Yesterday, Director Xu of the Institute said that the Institute, based on the actual situation in Shanghai, decided to consolidate new instruments and eliminate old instruments. The implementation steps are to carry out inspection and examination at the same time. The inspection work of small vegetable markets and vendors in each district has been completed. Currently, they are rushing to inspect rice shops throughout the city. If it is discovered that the shops and vegetable vendors that have already been inspected are still using instruments illegally, they hope that all sectors of society will assist in reporting them.</p>

<h3 id="e102">Returning Hong Kong Residents Talk: Hong Kong Gradually Restoring Old Appearance, Government and People Maintaining Each Other, Everything Back on Track <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] Since Hong Kong's restoration, its commercial situation has gradually returned to its former state. Six factors contribute to this: (1) No excessive taxes and levies. The Hong Kong government's tax revenue consists only of port taxes and police levies, without various new categories. (2) Credit currency prevails. Checks can be used to replace cash. Merchants consider dishonoring checks a disgraceful act. The Hong Kong government, to ensure merchants respect credit and trustworthiness, requires that all commercial transactions, such as sales contracts, be certified by lawyers and the authorities with a seal, to have legal effect. Therefore, neither party dares to easily break their word and bring trouble upon themselves. (3) Bank lending rates are extremely low. Banks do not pay interest on demand deposits but offer an annual interest rate of 3% on fixed deposits. Loans only charge a monthly interest rate of 6%. Thus, merchants can overdraw funds from banks to operate industrial and commercial businesses, which is far better than the high interest rates in Shanghai. (4) Buildings in Hong Kong destroyed by artillery fire have now been repaired or new buildings have been added. It is said that many foreign merchant property companies are selling their businesses in Shanghai and investing huge sums in Hong Kong to build large buildings, so the city is densely built and has quickly returned to its former appearance. (5) Although Hong Kong's trade has not yet returned to pre-war standards, the United Kingdom is actively trying to ship goods to Hong Kong in order to restore its Far East market. (6) Life is stable, and labor disputes are much more relaxed, unlike the disturbances here, which make the industrial and commercial circles hesitate. The above points were discussed by returning Hong Kong residents. Recording this for reference.</p>

<h3 id="e104">Summer Sales Have Passed, Autumn Sales Await: Woolen Fabric Industry Looks Forward and Backward, Small Businesses Already in Associations Feel Especially Depressed <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] The summer sales season for woolen fabrics has now passed, and the autumn sales season is approaching. As for the winter sales season, it is impossible to predict due to uncertainty about large-scale imports from abroad, and many fail due to the pressure of high-interest loans. Learning from previous mistakes, everyone is afraid to hoard goods. Buyers are adopting a wait-and-see attitude. Also, seeing that those who rushed to buy Melton early suffered losses, they are even more cautious. Looking at the recent market trends for autumn woolen fabrics, most prices have been driven high by summer goods. In addition, the inventory in Shanghai is lacking, especially for fine wool and glossy goods. Customer demand is gradually increasing. Imports from England are still pending. Although there are transshipments from Hong Kong, they are a drop in the bucket and far from sufficient. Some American goods have arrived, but apart from Melton women's fabrics, the quantity is also small, and the quality is not good, so people are still optimistic.</p>
<p>Looking back at the summer sales season for woolen fabrics around the Dragon Boat Festival, initial prices were generally considered too high, and there was mutual price cutting. Unexpectedly, the sales unexpectedly progressed greatly, and all goods became more in demand than supply. Prices soared. Due to the shortage of circulating goods in the market, those who held goods could ask any price they wanted, with no standard. There was often a difference of three to five thousand yuan per yard between different sellers, which was not surprising. However, transactions were mostly small and fragmented, because users who were not in urgent need were unwilling to stock up. For example, worsted yarn, palicos, and valentino, which sold for around 40,000 yuan in counterfeit currency per yard at this time last year, were priced at 30,000 yuan in legal tender this summer, then rose to over 50,000 yuan, and then to 70,000 yuan. The shortage and soaring prices of woolen fabrics led to the great activity in the sales of waxed thread, adhesive cloth, and various grades of burlap such as 945, 948, and 950. At the same time, the Air Force's popular American-style khaki rainproof cloth was selling widely and unexpectedly, with prices soaring. Manufacturers of rainproof cloth were making three times their profit. A custom-made suit of clothes generally cost 60,000 to 100,000 yuan in legal tender. Two years ago, the price of a custom-made suit of golden woolen fabric was not so high.</p>
<p>Currently, the cost of operations is increasing, and capital is limited. (More than ten people have gone bankrupt due to high-interest loans). English and American woolen fabrics are being ordered in large quantities. In the near future, they will inevitably arrive in a continuous stream. What will be the future of the woolen fabric market and prices? Every practitioner is wondering. The summer sales season is over, and whether autumn sales will be smooth is a cause for anxiety. In particular, small businesses that have recently been established and have joined the association feel especially depressed.</p>

<p>Li Feng Tannery opened yesterday. During the war, the factory moved to Chongqing, producing Bee Ball brand industrial belts and leather goods for the army, navy, and air force. After the victory, it returned to Shanghai to restore its operations. It is reported that the factory base and equipment now in operation are all owned by the former Jingchan China Leather Factory, and are new and complete. It produces 100,000 feet of leather belts per month. In addition, waterproof leather belts are also a new discovery in the domestic goods industry.</p>

<p>The Fuel Management Committee of the Executive Yuan previously approved merchants to order and import foreign coal due to the lack of domestic coal. Some of it came from Pearl Harbor, Canada, and other places. Over 20,000 tons have already arrived, and the rest are en route to China. It is reported that the authorities believe that importing foreign coal incurs a large amount of foreign exchange, and the domestic fuel transportation situation has improved. In fact, there is no need to import foreign coal. Therefore, it has been decided that from yesterday, the measures for encouraging merchants to procure and transport foreign coal, promulgated by the Fuel Management Committee in February of this year, will be abolished. Subsequently, the committee will be responsible for purchasing coal domestically, and will do its best to unblock sources and supply the needs of the entire city.</p>

<h3 id="e113">The Main Reasons for the Current Decline of Industry in Our Country <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Bo'an</p>
<p>In this era when our country's politics and economy are becoming increasingly complex, the domestic industrial and commercial sectors are generally declining! Domestic public opinion has repeatedly raised opinions and made urgent appeals, but this declining trend will only worsen, which is to be expected.</p>
<p>Industry is the lifeblood of a country. Without industry, there is no country. Looking at this World War, rather than being a mutual slaughter of human beings, it is more accurately a competition of industries. If the Allied countries did not have the highly developed industry of the United States as a backing, the outcome of the war could not have been determined! The Axis powers relied on their strong industries and did not hesitate to become enemies of the world; however, when the competition reached its limit, there could not be even the slightest difference. Comparing our country's industry with the world's powers, it can truly be said that we are a country "without industry." Precisely because its organization is weak, it cannot withstand a single blow in the economic turmoil. The current suffering of our country's industry and the main reasons for its inability to survive are: first, the lack of industrial capital; second, the inability of finished products to compete with foreign goods; and third, the high cost of manufacturing. These three reasons have led to the industrial collapse of today.</p>
<p>Why is there a lack of industrial capital? Before currency values are stabilized and before usury disappears, I dare say that there will never be a source of industrial capital. Industry is the slowest type of investment of all investments. Industrial production is not as flexible as commercial distribution. Its success cannot be seen in a year and a half. Before the war, some factories in our country took ten years to make a profit, and some even lost money. However, this approach created a solid foundation for them. Even if they were subjected to external fluctuations, they always stood firm. Therefore, in the current era of usury and profiteering, do you think there are still such fools who will invest in industry? This is one.</p>
<p>If you want the financial industry to invest money in factories, that is also wishful thinking. How much ability does the financial industry itself have to divert this large amount of working capital into non-performing loans is also a big question. This is two.</p>
<p>Industrial investment, to be honest, relies on the private sector. Now, our country's industrial conditions, as Liu Gongyun said, are those of the 19th century, which will inevitably be completely eliminated. Now, everyone in the country knows that running industry is important, but everyone also knows that the future of industry can determine its failure? Therefore, private capital cannot be introduced into industrial investment. This is three.</p>
<p>Next, we must talk about the problem of domestic goods not being able to compete with foreign goods. For every industrial product, first, it must compete, and you have no choice but to compete. The result of competition is, of course, the survival of the fittest. This is an inevitable principle.</p>
<p>Second, products must meet "purchasing power." With the same quality and the same goods, if Factory A sells for 10,000 and Factory B sells for 20,000, the former is suitable for "purchasing power." Moreover, when foreign goods are only "promoting sales" and cannot yet be said to be "dumping," Chinese industry is already loudly calling for help. In the future, once there is a real "dumping," what methods can be used to resist it? In short, with foreign goods, there is no choice but to compete. If you don't have the ability to compete, the only result is decline.</p>
<p>Again, the high cost of manufacturing is a fact, but it is not immutable. In all countries of the world, the manufacturing cost of industry is only decreasing, unlike our country, which is increasing day by day. The reason is due to the waste of "manpower" and the lack of utilization of "power" in our country's industry. In other countries, the "manpower" involved in transporting raw materials to the production of products is minimal. Currently, the production of a product in our country almost entirely requires "manpower." At a time when "wages" are rising higher than any commodity price, the difference between the use of "manpower" and "power" cannot be measured. Therefore, to seek the survival of industry, we must eliminate "manpower" as much as possible and use "power." This is the only condition for reducing production costs. In addition, in the present state where the agricultural foundation has not yet been established, it is impossible to reduce the cost of industrial production, because the decline in agricultural production is the increase in the raw materials for industrial production, and the finished product cannot meet the current "purchasing power."</p>
<p>Based on the above discussion, the country should have an overall plan for our country's industrial problems. Without planned industry, even if people with good intentions can make efforts according to their "artificial" efforts, I am afraid it will be in vain.</p>
<p>In April of last year, the US Foreign Economic Administration drew up a plan for planned industry for our country, which included 604 types of industries and the distribution of national regions, completely in accordance with modern industrial production conditions. However, the entire case is over 2,000 pages long. We only saw an outline. It is best to ask the government to publish the full text for Chinese industrialists to study, so that people will not be at a dead end and not know what to do!</p>
<p>Finally, we must also say that during the eight years of the War of Resistance, manpower, financial resources, and material resources were all taken from the countryside. The vitality is exhausted, and anemia has reached its extreme. Purchasing power has dropped to zero. Therefore, the current decline and even total collapse of all industrial and commercial sectors proves that the Chinese countryside is dying. I hope that those who talk about China's industrial construction will pay more attention to this point.</p>

<h3 id="e114">Hsinchu: Taiwan's Healthy Zone <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Jiang Muyun, Taiwan Airlines Report, Third of this Month</p>
<p>In Taiwan, medical scientists and hygienists consider Hsinchu to be the most standard and rare healthy zone. This healthy zone is based on a reasonable geographical situation. It is surrounded by mountains on the east, north, and south sides, and faces the strait on the west side. It is also the most prominent part of [illegible]. From the urban area to the seaside, it is only eight Chinese miles, and the temperature is constantly maintained at 21.4 degrees Celsius. The most easily felt seasonal winds are quite strong here. Therefore, Taiwan has "Hsinchu winds and Yilan rains." Hsinchu's winds and Yilan's rains are characteristics given to these two places by heaven. Because of the strong winds, germs spread through the air are not easy to stay in this area, which purifies Hsinchu.</p>
<p>On the Tainan transportation line, Hsinchu is like Suzhou in Jiangsu. It is the first large station passed through from Taipei to Tainan. The streets are wide asphalt roads, neat roadside trees, and shops. The Japanese era called it magnificent. Comparing this modern urban sentiment to Suzhou is probably a distance of an era! The people who live here clearly remember things that happened just 235 years ago. More than one hundred Fujianese people braved the sea and floated to Zhqian Port (now the old port). They used collective force to drive out the entrenched aborigines. This barren land is the original Hsinchu City, one of Taiwan's five major cities today.</p>
<p>This area should be healthy, but the people of Hsinchu are very severely plagued by abuse and sexually transmitted diseases. Recently, because of the discovery of plague, it was necessary to launch a widespread pre-emptive epidemic prevention campaign.</p>
<h3 id="e115">The City Government Complains About Poverty Every Day <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>Hsinchu faces the same fate as other cities. Because there is a large-scale airfield, more than 40% of it was destroyed by bombing, especially the eastern part of the city, which was the most severely bombed. The original commercial area was destroyed and forced to move to the west, but because the capacity of the West Gate Market is limited, a congested situation filling the streets remains, leaving a wartime scene. The city government originally controlled nine districts and has been reorganized into seven districts: East, South, West, North, Xiangshan, Zhudong, and Baoshan. After the merger, the original population of 56,000 has increased to over 117,000. Because Zhudong is an industrial area with production and minerals, the redrawing of boundaries caused fierce disputes between the county and the city. In the end, the city government won!</p>
<p>Mayor Guo Shaozong is a receiving staff member who came to Taiwan after the restoration. He told reporters that the repairs of bombed roads, bridges, sewers, and landing panels are scheduled to be completed by the end of this year. The waterworks project will be completed by the end of August. The repair of gas leaks and the plugging of leaks are also in progress.</p>
<p>Education is quite developed in the urban area, with 15 national schools, 231 classes, and over 10,000 enrolled children, one municipal middle school, and four provincial middle schools, including commercial, industrial, women's middle schools, and ordinary middle schools. The prevalent disease in all municipal schools is salary arrears. The mayor frankly said—all kinds of plans are impossible to implement without money. The city government treasury complains about poverty every day. The budget of 46 million for the 35th fiscal year has not yet been approved. Tax collection will start on July 15, but it will not be possible until the new grain is harvested in August. This period of shortage is not just the city of Hsinchu, but anemia is prevalent throughout the province.</p>
<p>Has the financial policy been determined? People are asking, but the echo is no.</p>
<h3 id="e116">Industrial City Plan <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>According to the city government's plan, Hsinchu City may leap to become a modern industrial city. The conditions it possesses are natural resources, convenient transportation, and a concentration of most factories. In particular, Zhudong, the lifeline of Hsinchu City, passes through the Baoshan mining area, which is 17 kilometers away. There, natural gas is produced that is comparable in quality to the crude oil produced in Kettleman, California, in the western United States (the entire island can produce 30 crude oil wells, with an annual output of 23,400 barrels. The entire island has more than one hundred natural gas wells, almost all of which are in the western part of the island). Limestone, silica sand, etc., and coal reserves are even more abundant, and they are the best coking coal on the island, so steel can be smelted. There is also the Southern Cement Factory with an annual output of 100,000 tons, and the wood produced in the mountains. In December of the 33rd year of the Japanese era, the construction of a railway began here with a total cost of 4.55 million Taiwan dollars, which was expected to be completed in one year and four months. As a result, the shrinkage of the wartime economy caused them to complete only 40%. Last year, the city government formulated a plan to complete this railway, with an estimated cost of 7.89 million yuan. Because it was not approved for a long time, the price of goods increased this year, and it had to be increased to 29 million yuan, which was recently approved. It is clear who should bear the responsibility for this invisibly increased loss. The authorities' prudence is certainly necessary, but prices have betrayed the constraints of government laws; as a result, the entire national loss was paid to time.</p>
<h3 id="e117">Building an Industrial Railway <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>The industrial railway from Hsinchu to Zhudong is now using the existing rails and sleepers and will start construction immediately. If there are no accidents, old locomotives can be used to transport goods and passengers within half a year. Mayor Guo said that this road, with Zhudong as its terminus, will also become the industrial center.</p>
<p>According to accurate estimates, more than 10,000 tons of wood, more than 5,000 tons (MT) of fuel, 7,000 tons of rice, more than 400,000 tons of bamboo forests, and more than 5,000 tons of fruit can be transported from the production area in the future. The coal transported from the "Ghana brand" coal mine as the central location, the Southern Cement Company providing and producing 400,000 tons of limestone, as well as silica sand and fiber, are all provided and produced by the existing Imperial Petroleum Company, Ghana Brand Coal Mine, Shiono Chemical Co., Ltd., and Uematsu Lumber Factory.</p>
<p>The 600,000-volt transformer of the Natural Gas Research Institute was destroyed by bombing and is still under construction. The Shiono Chemical Factory is a factory that uses the mandarin oranges and other raw materials produced in the city to manufacture scented oil for sale outside the province. Uematsu's current lumber production capacity is only 100,000 stone. If the Lucheng Mountain area can be developed in the future, Zhudong will need lumber equipment with an annual output of 200,000 stone.</p>
<h3 id="e118">Small-Scale Modern Port <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>The fatal flaw of Hsinchu industrial city is the lack of an export trade port. The municipal authorities are planning to build a small-scale modern port at Nanliao (the old port) on the coast. The Touqian River and Fengshan River, which originate from the inland areas of the island, flow into the sea from here. It is only 130-odd li to Fuzhou and only 160 li to Xiamen, which is about 70 li closer than Keelung. Hsinchu is the closest point on the coastline of Taiwan to the coastline of Fujian Province. The Japanese once considered it a commercial port, but because the port was silted up, the sea breeze was strong, and the port lacked equipment, the current average number of ships coming from Fuzhou is only twenty-seven or eight per month, with imported goods weighing about ten tons. If this port can be rebuilt, so that ships can enter and leave without being affected by shallow water and strong winds, it is estimated that the tonnage of cargo handled can be increased dozens to hundreds of times per month. At the same time, the abundant milkfish production and the aquatic industry can be developed.</p>
<p>The planned width of the old port entrance is 30 meters, the width inside the port is 100 meters, and the total length is 250 meters. Wharves and revetments will also be constructed. The lowest low tide level inside the port is below 2 meters. The eastern bank wall is 250 meters long and will be used as a fishing ground to store fish. Land-based buildings related to fishing port facilities will be built on the back side. The southwestern bank wall is 250 meters long and will be used as a commercial port, with warehouses and shops behind it. To prevent the impact of floods from the Touqian River and high tides, flood defense dikes will be built. This will accommodate 70 machine fishing boats under 30 tons, 20 steamships under 100 tons, and 30 sailboats, for a total of 120 vessels. The first mayor said that the industrialized and modernized city of Hsinchu has the potential to be completed, and now it is even more necessary to complete a truly healthy city.</p>
<h3 id="e119">Voice of Xuzhou <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>— Xuzhou Dispatch, 4th, by Guo Jiannong</p>
<p>After nine years of absence, upon returning, everything in Xuzhou today, in my eyes, seems to have changed. When I, as a veteran, took the first step into Xuzhou, what immediately caught my eye were the wide roads and tall foreign-style buildings. Two main lines, running horizontally and vertically, cut through Xuzhou, even wider than the roads in Nanjing by one-third. When the enemy occupied Xuzhou, they listed Xuzhou as one of the six major cities in North China and used the economic power of the puppet Reformed Government to carry out construction. Later, it was changed to the Central China Special Zone, and the northern funds could not be replenished, so it was stopped. Therefore, the city's construction was not completed. After the recovery, due to the disturbances of the Communist army on the periphery, it was still in a state of military affairs, so naturally there was no time for this. Although the county council had a construction committee, it was only in the design stage, and it was difficult to realize at present. The loss of materials during the takeover also invisibly reduced the power of construction, which is regrettable!</p>
<p>New Urban Buildings and Refugee Tent Shelters</p>
<p>At the same time, in a corner of society, what is reflected is the new buildings of the new city: refugee tent shelters. Along the Jinpu Railway in the east of the city and near the east side of Yunlong Mountain in the south of the city, the shantytowns are closely packed, all built with reed mats, resembling military tents. Widows and children gather, spreading their bedding on the ground. When it rains, the roofs leak, and the ground is wet, with mud and water reaching the ankles. Although relief organizations and local people are doing their best to provide relief, they feel that there is too little porridge for too many monks. I remember when I passed through Zhenjiang, I talked to Wang Gongyu, the director of the Civil Affairs Department, about the construction of Xuzhou. Wang sighed and said that the difficult matter at present is the relief issue. This is indeed a serious problem. According to estimates, there are no less than tens of thousands of refugees near Xuzhou, and even more households are displaced in the countryside. Wealthy households have become refugees, and poor families are all engaged in hard labor. Thugs and ruffians are the central cadres in the "liberated areas." I have traveled through Sichuan, Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, and Anhui, and have not seen such a catastrophe along the way. "Who is responsible for this? Who caused this?" I cannot help but feel resentful towards these perpetrators.</p>
<p>The Main Culprit in Robbery Cases is Executed, Property Rights are Cleared but Not Completely</p>
<p>The society in Xuzhou cannot yet be called stable. A few months ago, robberies occurred in the streets at night. It is said that the perpetrators were related to a certain department. After the case was solved, they could not escape the facts and have been executed. There have been no such incidents in the past two or three months, which can be considered a good phenomenon. However, what the people feel most painful about is the clearing of property rights. It is said that there have been five or six registrations and investigations, and all kinds of procedures have been completed. Recently, the Suzhou office of the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau and the Xuzhou branch have been sealed again, executing provisional attachment. Recently, the chairmen of the Commerce, Agriculture, Industry, Education, and Women's Associations jointly sent a letter to the office, publicly questioning three items in the Xuzhou newspaper: (1) Private real estate that has been occupied or rebuilt by the enemy and puppets, and whose private property rights have been cleared by the municipal government or the Public and Private Property Rights Clearing Committee, and have obtained a management license, why has your office sealed it again after coming to Xuzhou? Is the previous handling by the municipal government and the Clearing Committee legal? (2) The houses sealed after the sealing are nominally provisionally attached, but why are there further sealing incidents after the provisional attachment? (3) After the people's property has been cleared in accordance with the law and the property rights have been determined, the government should protect it in accordance with the law. What will be the final disposition of such provisional attachments or further sealing in the long run? This running account is enough to be settled, and there are also troops stationed in military units occupying official units for retention. The people's requests to resume business are not granted, and there are thousands of problems. How will it be solved?</p>
<p>Organizing Armed Home Returning Corps, Refugees Advance with the Army</p>
<p>The military development is the best phenomenon in Xuzhou at present. Refugees from various counties organize armed home returning corps and advance with the military. Xuzhou West has recovered Xiaoxian County, and Xuzhou East has recovered Shuanggou. There is development in all directions. However, the Longhai East Road has been severely damaged by the Communist army. The railway from Baitabu to A'hu East Sluice Gate has been completely destroyed, the bridge holes of the Grand Canal have been blown up, and the roadbed between the artillery car and Zhaodun has been dug up. The Railway Bureau is rushing to repair it with the army. Recently, it has been reported that 10,000 Communist troops have gathered north of Zhaodun, and disguised teams have been discovered south of the Yanhuang section of the West Road. 10,000 troops have also been added to support Shuanggou. It is said that the National Army plans to first clear the south of the Longhai line and then sweep after the sorghum is harvested. However, the people in the water and fire all want to get rid of their hellish lives as soon as possible and hope for a swift sweep and clearing.</p>
<p>The education in Xuzhou can be said to be quite developed. There is currently one national school (National Normal College), four provincial schools (Jiangsu College, Xuzhou Middle School, Xuzhou Normal School, Xuzhou Women's Normal School), one municipal middle school (Municipal Middle School), one county middle school (County Middle School), and seven private middle schools (Xin Xin, Peizheng, Ding Ming, September 18th, Ziyang, Dapeng, Yunlong). In terms of primary schools, each town has a central school. The number of students in each middle school is mostly over ten classes, and some central schools have as many as thirty classes. With the expansion of the urban area and the increase in population, the number of students has also increased. All schools are currently enrolling students, and there are indeed many applicants. However, the Department of Education has not issued a clear order for the placement of veterans, which is felt to be slow and incomplete.</p>
<p>Material Construction Requires Intensified Spiritual Construction</p>
<p>Finally, let's talk about the public opinion in Xuzhou. Among the newspapers that were re-published before the war, only the Xuzhou Newspaper was re-published. Although the Minbao was also re-published, it was stopped due to the difficulty of printing. The machines and type of the Xin Xuzhou were looted by the enemy and puppets, and it is unknown where they were transferred when they were taken over, so they could not be restored. There are two newly added newspapers, Zhengyi Zhongbao, whose views are fair and appropriate, but their criticism of local issues seems to be still too little, perhaps due to the limitations of timeliness and environment. I remember when I passed through Zhenjiang, I talked to local people in the province about the cultural construction of Xuzhou. Liu Xuzhou, the secretary-general of the Provincial Council, called for the establishment of a central local public opinion. Truly, what kind of construction does the new Xuzhou need? The material may be pending for the moment, but the spiritual is really imminent!</p>

<h3 id="e120">Dynamics in Suiyuan and Mongolia <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>— Correspondent Liu Yingyuan, Guisui</p>
<p>Comprehensive Report on the Situation of Various Banners</p>
<p>Since the delegation of Mongol Banners celebrating victory and returning to the capital to pay respects to Nanjing left Guisui, the recent situation of the Eighteen Mongol Banners in Suiyuan and Mongolia has been very quiet. The Sheritu Zhao, where Mongolians gathered in Guisui, is also much quieter than before. Recently, in the Ulanqab League, except for several conflicts between the Communist army's incorporated puppet Mongolian army of Ulijile's department and the Suiyuan Security Division of E You-san's department on the Chahar-Suiyuan border, other places are still relatively quiet. However, the covert activities of certain plainclothes armed personnel near Bailingmiao have made Sonam Chokjur, the Jasak of the Siziwang Banner, afraid to live in the Wangfu (prince's residence). He secretly returned to the banner for more than a week and then hurriedly returned to Guisui.</p>
<p>Among the three Urad Banners, the West Gong Banner is the most troublesome. Queen Yizhunfeng recently incorporated several Bao (units of 100 households) of Han people from the Baotou County into the Banner government and arbitrarily printed people's symbols. Landlords in the Zhongtan area are actively purchasing guns and establishing local defense teams to protect themselves. Among the seven banners of the Ikjoo League, Qi Quanxi, the Western Assistant of the Junwang Banner, is representing Prince Tu in Baotou, busy taking over the puppet Ikjoo League Office. Wang Pengcheng, the Western Assistant of the Darat Banner, has not been released from prison due to the murder of the Han Chinese Wang Sanjie case. Qi Yushan, the acting Jasak of the Uxin Banner, accompanied the young Prince Qi Shiying to visit Commander Fu before returning to the banner. Qi Sicheng, the security commander of the Otok Banner, came to Suiyuan, but has not returned for more than a month. Under the leadership of the two old-fashioned princes, Prince A and Beizi E, the Anti-Jin Banner and the Jasak Banner are like stagnant water without ripples.</p>
<p>Glimpses of Political Affairs in the Jungar Banner</p>
<p>Since the assassination of the dictator Qi Wenying in the Jungar Banner, and because the Jasak Qi Zhiguo died young without heirs, a post-mortem reorganization committee similar to a joint government has been established to preside over political affairs. The committee consists of seven members, including representatives from various factions, and one Han Chinese member. For the time being, they are getting along peacefully. No one dares to guarantee what will happen in the future. Young people from the Tumet Banner who went to Jining seeking new stimulation have disappeared. According to those who returned disappointed, it is easy to enter the "liberated area" but difficult to leave. The four Eastern Banners are all under the control of the Communist army, and the liquidation policy has driven many people to Suiyuan. The Mongolian refugees are being generously relieved by the provincial government. Because they miss their farmland and pastures, they are also calling for an armed return home. At 8:00 p.m. on the 20th of last month, Commander Fu convened the heads of relevant agencies in the heavy rain to hold a temporary Mongolian affairs meeting. It is heard that the main topics discussed were supporting the Mongolian Banners and stabilizing the Mongolian Banners, as well as studying plans for governing Mongolia. It is said that a public notice will be announced on this matter soon.</p>
<p>Farmland in Seven Counties West of Suiyuan is Flooded</p>
<p>In recent years, the population in various parts of the Northwest has increased, and afforestation movements have been widely launched in Gansu, Qinghai, Ningxia, and Suiyuan. Therefore, the desert climate has gradually improved. Winters are not as harsh as before the war, and summer rainfall is more abundant than in previous years. According to the Suiyuan Water Conservancy Bureau, the water level of the Yellow River has increased by 2.20 meters during the "fu shui" period, causing the canals in the Hetao area to overflow. The Yellow River near Baotou and Dengkou is overflowing its banks, less than four zhang from the railway. As of now, more than 100,000 mu of farmland in the seven counties west of Suiyuan has been flooded. It is heard that when the autumn floods arrive, the situation will be even more rampant. At the end of the summer and beginning of the autumn of the thirty-second year of the Republic, the Yellow River overflowed its banks in the Hetao area. Fortunately, the garrison troops assisted the people in preventing and blocking it, and no major disaster occurred. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, most of the 70,000 troops in the Hetao area were transferred east, and many strong men joined the army and left their hometowns.</p>
<p>Garrison Troops are Deployed to Challenge the Water</p>
<p>Currently, party and government personnel in the Hetao area are leading the elderly, weak, women, and children day and night to prevent and block the floods. At night, the canals are filled with red and green lanterns. Commander Fu has ordered all the defending troops of the × division stationed in the Hetao area to mobilize and fight the water. Recently, the summer crops have been harvested. If the water level in the upper reaches continues to rise, 70% to 80% of the autumn crops may be corrupted by the overflowing water. In addition, on the 11th of last month, thick clouds gathered in the north, and it rained continuously for nine days. It only cleared up on the 21st. Most of the summer crops that had not yet been harvested were moldy in the rain. 20% to 30% of the yellow earth houses where villagers lived were collapsed by the heavy rain, and there were incidents of people being crushed and injured. Many bridges on the west section of the Pingyuan Road were washed away by mountain floods, which has slowed down traffic. Many livestock in the banners of Suiyuan and Mongolia are suffering from scabies due to the wet soil. The provincial government receives disaster reports every day like snowflakes, and has requested the central government to quickly allocate relief funds to alleviate the suffering of the border people who are suffering from both natural disasters and man-made calamities.</p>

<p>Let the Children Read</p>
<p>Editor: Since the victory, the Shanghai municipal government is striving to improve, but because the municipal treasury is strained, many places cannot meet the high expectations of the citizens. Especially the education problem has reached a very serious stage. During the enemy-puppet period, citizens were unwilling to let their children receive enslaved education, and even wasted several years of precious school age. Some have just returned from the Great Rear Area. Now they want to send their children to school, but there is no place to send them. Most schools, especially municipal primary schools, do not openly enroll students. Sending children to school is as difficult as finding a job.</p>
<p>A certain municipal primary school in Hongkou originally had twelve classrooms. This time, it held an entrance examination, and the results showed that more than 1,700 people applied. If the original old students are included in the statistics, these students need to open up to fifty classes to accommodate them.</p>
<p>In theory, primary school is national education. Citizens have the obligation to complete primary school education, and it can also be said to be a right of taxpayers. They have the right to demand that the government provide their children with the opportunity to receive primary school education. School authorities should distinguish between high and low grades in the grades to be enrolled, regardless of the level of the students who want to study, no matter how many people there are, and cannot refuse to accept them.</p>
<p>However, because there is no way to obtain educational funds, we feel that the education problem has reached a very serious stage.</p>
<p>But, has the city government tried its best?</p>
<p>Of course, the few primary schools exemplified above have their special reasons. Because the Hongkou District was originally inhabited by Japanese residents. After the Japanese residents evacuated, the population is increasing rapidly. Moreover, there are only two municipal primary schools in that district. In particular, the fact that other districts' primary schools are not enrolling students is also an important reason for the surge in the number of candidates in that primary school. These are all special factors, and there are only two ways to solve them: either open several other primary schools in this district, or let this primary school use its original school site to provide as much school equipment as possible and expand the number of classes as much as possible. On the one hand, all schools should be expanded and dispersed in an all-round way in order to be solved, otherwise many school-age children will have no place to enroll.</p>
<p>In general, because the city government's finances are strained, there is no way to provide expansion funds for education. Moreover, fearing that citizens will increase their burden, schools are not allowed to raise funds on their own. Therefore, the managers of all levels of schools dare not make expansion plans. Private schools are also strictly managed, and people who are enthusiastic about education dare not try to start a business.</p>
<p>For this kind of reality, if we want to solve the problem, we dare not make too high-sounding arguments, for example, to ask people who are enthusiastic about education to donate money to schools voluntarily, or to ask the managers of various schools to understand the importance of education and not to be too concerned about the issue of funding. To be honest, in this society, under today's economic conditions, without a proper solution, no one has the power to solve this huge problem alone. To allow the education business to remain high-minded, without seeking a solution from the funding issue, will only lead the education business to its death.</p>
<p>We believe that there are several ways that may solve this serious problem:</p>
<p>(1) If municipal schools still have room for expansion, they should be helped to expand as much as possible. If it is impossible to provide equipment costs, parents of students may be allowed to raise funds. The city government will still provide regular expenses. In this way, according to the current situation, the burden on each parent will not be more than 20,000 to 30,000 yuan per semester. Although it is not as good as free education, it seems slightly better than being turned away. Many parents are willing to do this as long as their children have books to read.</p>
<p>(2) The municipal government should submit a petition to the Executive Yuan to order the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration to provide low-interest loans for education, whether it is municipal or private, whether it is a newly established or existing school. If the Education Bureau believes that there is a real need for expansion, it can borrow funds from the four United Banks for establishment or expansion with the guarantee of the municipal government and strict management by the Education Bureau. This loan will be repaid by the municipal schools when the city government's finances improve. In private schools, it will be repaid in installments over several semesters.</p>
<p>(3) When allocating enemy and puppet houses in various regions, the municipal government should pay more attention to education, and should not focus too much on university school buildings. Especially in enemy-occupied areas, school buildings for primary and secondary schools should be reserved.</p>
<p>(4) Instead of allocating funds to provide relief for those who have dropped out of school, it is better to use this money to rescue children who are about to lose their school age.</p>
<p>In short, children cannot be left without books to read; we must think of ways in the absence of ways. (Ding Lifan)</p>

<h3 id="e122">A Scene of Broadcast Debate on U.S. Policy Toward China Held in Springfield, Massachusetts <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>— Airmail dispatch from New York, July 31, by Wei Fan</p>
<p>In any case, the aid we give to the Central Government of China should not be used to incite civil war. All the efforts we make now and in the future are to promote a unified China.</p>
<p>(Walton Butterworth, Director of the Far Eastern Division of the U.S. State Department)</p>
<p>Recently, after the Anping Incident, U.S. Congressman Marcantonio of the left wing loudly advocated "U.S. troops should immediately withdraw from China and stop aiding China." This did not surprise most people, as he had long held this view. What is worth reporting to the countrymen is that in May or June, before the ceasefire order in the Northeast was issued, a broadcast debate on U.S. policy toward China was held in Springfield, Massachusetts, USA. Besides Congressman Marcantonio, those who participated included Congressman Judd and Walton Butterworth, Director of the Far Eastern Division of the State Department. From this debate, one can get a glimpse of the attitude of the U.S. government and the public. Butterworth said: The United States is committed to helping China achieve peaceful unification, which is a realistic policy. Congressman Judd said that the situation in Northeast China is now extremely complicated and may endanger world peace. If agreed by all parties, the United Nations could temporarily take over the administration of Northeast China until China is truly unified domestically. A world war occurred in Northeast China, and the region is now a dangerous powder keg. Marcantonio's speech reflected the opinions of the left wing and repeated the old tune of attacks habitually made by communists. He accused the Chinese government of failing to comply with the agreement to establish a coalition government. Judd and Marcantonio held different opinions on the cause of the current crisis in Northeast China and refused to yield to each other. Judd believed that the turmoil in China should be mainly attributed to the planning activities of the Communist Party, while Marcantonio said that the Central Government of China had failed to comply with the regulations. However, they all agreed that from the perspective of U.S. security and world peace, China's unification is indeed necessary, and Marshal Marshall's efforts in this regard should be trusted and supported. Butterworth summarized the State Department's views, believing that the United States' commitment to helping China achieve peace and unification is not a selfish act, but to promote international interests. Because of China's failure to unite, Japan was able to launch its aggression in 1931, and the United States' participation in the all-out war in 1941 was also directly caused by this. Congressman Judd correctly pointed out: We must support China's independence and the integrity of its territory and sovereignty, but we can no longer completely rely on the principles of the self-restrained Open Door and the Nine-Power Treaty. We must actively strive to bring about the emergence of a strong and unified China. The question today is not whether our efforts can achieve a perfect unification of China in the short term, but whether we can allow ourselves to abandon or change the direction of this effort to promote China's unification in the face of obvious difficulties. The policy proposed by Marshal Marshall is to achieve China's unification by peaceful means. Any other way beyond this policy, in my (Judd speaking) view, is to fully support the Chinese government, hoping to achieve unification by force. However, this has the possibility of creating the following unpleasant fact: China will be divided into two hostile camps, and any constructive policy in the Far East will therefore be seriously affected. In conclusion, Butterworth stated: "I deeply feel that while avoiding being drawn into Chinese partisan politics, we should continue to give Marshal Marshall trust and support to help him carry out the important task he is shouldering concerning the long-term interests of the United States, China, and international peace." In this broadcast debate, the most noteworthy thing was the attitude of Walton Butterworth, Director of the Far Eastern Division of the State Department. It is said that after collecting and reviewing the opinions of various newspapers, the U.S. State Department firmly believes that almost all parties in the United States support President Truman's statement on China policy and also admire Marshal Marshall's approach to handling the "tricky" China issue. When asked if the opportunity for China to achieve domestic unification would be undermined if the Soviet Union supported the Communist Party while the United States supported the Central Government, Butterworth replied: Being undermined would be a minor matter. However, our policy is to consult with the Central Government of China, because the Central Government is the Chinese government recognized by all parties, and it is not only we who are only assisting the Central Government of China, but the Soviet Union's official policy is also the same. This can be seen from the alliance treaty signed between the Central Government and the Soviet Union last August. However, in any case, the aid we give to the Central Government of China should not be used to incite civil war. All the efforts we make now and in the future are to promote a unified China. We definitely do not want China's situation to be affected by external forces from both sides. For this reason, Secretary of State Byrnes held on to this concept at the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference last December and reached an agreement with Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov and British Foreign Minister Bevin to issue a declaration stating that "China must become a unified and democratic China under the National Government, with broad participation of all democratic elements in all departments of the National Government, and stop domestic conflicts." Butterworth continued: "The most urgent task for the Chinese National Government is to formulate an agricultural reform plan to improve the people's livelihood, so as to prove that its government is indeed governed for the people." The reporter believes that Director Butterworth's remarks should be valued by all parties in our country. If the U.S. policy toward China is reviewed in the future, how will it evolve? I am afraid it still cannot go beyond this scope.</p>
<h3 id="e123">The Heat Wave in Changchun <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Han Qingtao from Shenyang Airmail Dispatch, this newspaper, 2nd</p>
<p>The heat wave has blown into Changchun, and Changchun is sweltering in the summer heat! On Zhongshan Road (formerly known as Central Avenue) in Changchun, the big trees shade the street, blocking the rocket-like sunlight and giving pedestrians great kindness. Several large squares and a few streets without trees flash with blue sky, scorching people. Although the streets are like this, the rooms are breezy, and it is even cooler in the evening, sometimes even feeling a little cold.</p>
<p>Most people's clothing is still white and blue cloth. Luan-colored Zhongshan suits and Western suits do not feel very shabby, because the weather is cool when it is cloudy and in the morning and evening. Red cloth short shirts and pants are still favored by women and young girls, and blue cloth is also common clothing, especially for the lower body.</p>
<p>Except for tall buildings, most of the residents in the urban area still live in low Japanese-style houses. Fortunately, the evenings are cool and not too sultry, and there are not many mosquitoes, so it is very comfortable to sleep. In the evening, there are few pedestrians on the street, and the habit of going to bed early and getting up early is still maintained here.</p>
<p>Good Business for Vehicles and Horses</p>
<p>Although some of the large buildings have been damaged, and there are also some bullet marks, the scars have not yet healed, but generally speaking, most of them can still be considered complete, which is much better than Shenyang.</p>
<p>The number of trams running can still barely meet the needs of citizens. On the main roads in the city, there is a burst of clattering hoofbeats; on Zhongshan Avenue, there is also a string of wheels rolling on the ground. The fare for horse carts starts at five yuan, and the tram is five yuan across the board?</p>
<p>The business of several large shopping malls and stores on Huoma Road in the city is still good. General daily necessities can be said to be readily available. Opening hours in the morning are mostly at eight or nine o'clock, and they close at seven o'clock in the afternoon.</p>
<p>On Wuma Road, the streets are lined with vendors hawking miscellaneous Japanese goods. They buy them cheaply and sell them at high prices, making a lot of profit in an instant, so many are doing this kind of business, similar to the scene on Hongkou Qujiang Road in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Japanese Who Have Not Left</p>
<p>The Japanese expatriates in Changchun have begun to evacuate. More than a dozen iron sheds at the South Station are filled with Japanese men and women expatriates preparing to board the train. Mouyu is also making plans to return home. According to a survey, the total number of Japanese expatriate prisoners in Changchun is 230,000, and more than 50,000 have already been evacuated.</p>
<p>On the road from "Eirakucho" in the south to "Yoshinocho" in the north, eight or nine out of ten are places where Japanese expatriates sell clothing. This is almost exactly the same as "Kasugacho" and "Aobacho" in Shenyang. Shenyang takes "Kasugacho" as the center, and Changchun takes "Yoshinocho" as the focus. Our compatriots are also mixed in the long streets, doing business inside.</p>
<p>Dancing is banned in Shenyang, but dance halls in Changchun still exist. The beautiful music of the band is sent outdoors through loudspeakers, and inside there are many people and Japanese dancing girls dancing the "Beng Cha Beng" steps. A dance ticket circulation coupon is five yuan, and sitting at a table for half an hour is one hundred yuan. The "Zhijiang" Dance Hall is one of them, but soldiers are not welcome. If they enter, someone will pat them on the shoulder and persuade them to leave.</p>
<p>On the afternoons of the 14th and 15th, the Japanese expatriate prisoners in Changchun gathered their excellent singers and dancers and held a meeting at the Zhongshan Memorial Hall to慰劳 the National Army. The music, lights, dance, and singing were all very good. Among the Chinese pop songs sung, there were "When Will You Come Again" and "Roses Bloom Everywhere." The Japanese girls who sang wore brightly colored and well-fitting cheongsams, singing beautiful Chinese lyrics with expressions and light dances, making our brothers enthusiastic, and applause filled the sky. These smiles and sounds had been presented to different people over the past ten months.</p>
<p>Leap Forward in Propaganda</p>
<p>The press in Changchun has published in a competitive manner. As of now, there are nine newspapers: "Central Daily News," "Forward Daily News," "New Life Daily News," "Huasheng Daily News," "Jilin Daily News," "Xiangchao Daily News," "Construction Daily News," "Northeast People's News," and "Minsheng Morning News." In addition, there are Japanese versions of "Northeast Guide," "National New Newspaper," and the Japanese version of "Forward Daily News." Each newspaper is almost equipped with excellent printing conditions. In order to maximize the effectiveness of propaganda, many newspapers include books and newspapers as supplements.</p>
<p>There are approximately eight enemy-puppet cinemas, all of which were taken over by the Changchun Office of the Northeast Special Commissioner of the Central Propaganda Department. The films being shown are produced in Shanghai, but most of them are outdated. Among them, the most produced by the puppet Manchukuo "Man'ei." There are also quite a few Japanese films. These are allowed to be screened after inspection. According to Mr. Pan Gongbi, the special commissioner: "The constructive films made by puppet Manchukuo and Japan can be temporarily used by changing the explanations to maintain the current situation of the film industry. When new films from the Central Film Studio arrive in the future, the audience's tastes can be changed."</p>
<p>All cinemas are now controlled by the Changchun Office of the Northeast Special Commissioner of the Central Propaganda Department. Film merchants operate on a lease-for-rent basis. It is said that the Changchun's largest Zhongshan Hall Theater will also be handed over by the Three People's Principles Youth League soon to the Changchun Office of the Northeast Special Commissioner of the Central Propaganda Department for reasonable use.</p>
<p>It is said that the Cultural Movement Committee has also started working in Changchun and should have some performance. Mayor Zhao Junmai said: "Changchun's printing conditions are superior to other parts of the Northeast, and the general cultural level is also very high. I hope everyone can make good use of these superior conditions."</p>
<p>The Deserted Puppet Palace</p>
<p>The puppet palace is deserted. Not only are there few horses in front of the gate, but the main gate is also locked. When the reporter passed by the gate of the "Palace Affairs Department" by car, the yellow glazed tiles on the roof of the building reflected a dim light. Outside the palace gate, overgrown with weeds, a team of soldiers was drilling. Inside the palace courtyard, two or three soldiers walked to the side. Besides the guards with guns on the right side, there was nothing else.</p>
<p>Although Changchun cannot be spring forever, the current summer is still beautiful and tranquil. I pray that the bleak scene will not come.</p>
<h3 id="e124">The Clouds Over the Provisional Capital <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>— Qing Shi, airmail dispatch from Chongqing, 3rd</p>
<p>During the peak of summer in Chongqing, the entire society seems to have fallen into a state of boredom. Let's talk about the merchants first! The wisdom of the merchants here is not necessarily weaker than that of the merchants "under the feet" (Chongqing people call people from Jiangsu and Zhejiang "under the feet," they also know how to make money, and compete to do speculative business.</p>
<p>A Landslide of Foreign Goods</p>
<p>Glassware floods the market. The appetite of imported foreign goods merchants is bigger than that of the Shanghai merchants. The brands of "glass" and "atomic" can be heard everywhere, and there is almost a feeling that there is no market if one is missing. Merchants are all smart and quick-witted. Sometimes, a fashionable item arrives at the same time. Because the outlet is narrow, it forms a stagnant state. Take the American glass comb as an example. It was sold for three thousand yuan each two months ago… and it was only available in luxurious department stores… Later, it was only sold for one thousand five hundred yuan each, and recently it has fallen to one thousand yuan. Other foreign goods are also the same. The most unlucky ones are the small merchants and street vendors. They use capital borrowed at high interest rates to operate foreign goods. At first, there was a little hope, but now it is frozen, and everyone is complaining. Big businesses will not be damaged. They are well-informed. If this business is not good, they will try another one. Anyway, they have a lot of money and can turn around easily. They always win a few. So in this society, the rich get richer, and the poor, no matter how hard they work, are still poor. "Big money makes small money" is absolutely correct.</p>
<p>The arrival of foreign goods is like a landslide. It is impossible for the small and medium-sized factories in our country, which are economically poor, to block this pit. Labor strikes are raging: layoffs, closures, and downsizing are heard every day. According to statistics, more than 360 factories have been sacrificed in these disputes. Now, those who can barely maintain are either those with extremely large financial resources, those with official capital participating, or those with some special forces to protect them. These struggling manufacturers could not withstand the invasion of foreign goods a month ago and once called for help… what about advocating the use of domestic goods… Despite shouting their throats out, they did not get a single sympathetic response. As a result, they changed their careers and speculated. Factories were closed and another business was started. The machines were like dead people in coffins, and no one asked about them. The word "production" has gradually disappeared from the mouths of manufacturers. Everything is left to fate, allowing the wind and rain to invade at will.</p>
<p>Construction of the Provisional Capital Remains a Slogan</p>
<p>When the government left Chongqing, there was a slogan "Build the Provisional Capital." Under this slogan with historical significance, the officials of the municipal government and the municipal council were busy, holding meetings, discussing, planning, and everything was perfect, building sewer projects, the two-river bridge, new-style roads, and trolleybuses! A provisional capital is really like a beautifully painted picture, and the citizens are happy to hear it! But after saying it for a few months and publishing it in the newspaper countless times, the funding is still at a loss, and it is only "talking on paper." Not only has this great plan not been realized, but even the original civilization has gradually degenerated! In the past, electricity was cut off regularly in different areas. Although some areas were temporarily dark, most areas were bright. Because the power outage was scheduled, the citizens had already prepared candles, so it did not affect nighttime work. Now, however, the power is cut off at any time, everywhere, and the darkness is unpredictable, making the general public laugh and cry, and causing considerable losses. Tap water is also often cut off, causing the coolies who make a living by carrying water to gather and fight for water, and the price of water has skyrocketed. Speaking of the story of public buses, it is really something that people "under the feet" have never heard of. The buses are aging items from seven or eight years ago. When the government had not yet returned to the capital, it promised to allocate one hundred new buses to replace them. Later, the supplies were "requisitioned" and emptied, and the official paperwork took time, so it has not been cashed in. After the government returned to the capital, this city, which is ornamental and almost historical, has gradually been forgotten by people.</p>
<p>Mountains of Garbage and Overflowing Sewage</p>
<p>The public buses here are more "scientific" than those in Shanghai. Its tail will emit smoke, which smells bad and is unbearable. Every time it drives into the street, it either drags a straight line of smoke or rotates like a gray-black rolling dragon with the wind. Unfortunately, people are afraid to see it, and no one goes to appreciate its posture. The garbage here is famous throughout the country. In some places, it is piled up like mountains. The collapse of garbage on a branch road in the southern district caused an unprecedented tragedy, killing nine residents. At that time, the newspapers exposed the incident, and the police局 was once tense and carried out cleaning work, but afterwards, it became deserted and no one cared about it. In secluded alleys and cold streets, garbage and urine can be seen everywhere. When the sun comes out, it smells pungent. Every time there is a heavy rain, the sewage overflows, making it impossible for people to set foot. If you pay a little attention to the streets when you walk, you can find dead rats everywhere. From morning to night, no one cleans them, so the prevalence of diseases in summer cannot be said to be a factor. People living in the provisional capital seem to be used to it and don't think it's strange, and no one suggests it to the health bureau, so those in charge of cleaning agencies seem to be happy to take it easy and not care.</p>
<p>Dance Halls Forge Ahead</p>
<p>Everything has not progressed, but we cannot deny that dance halls have made progress in forging ahead. There are seven large and small dance halls here: Sino-American Night Garden, International Chongqing Club, Allies, Yangtze River, and one that has not yet opened. Each dance hall is improving its decoration in order to compete for business. It is luxurious, comfortable, and men and women are fascinated by it, creating a lot of social scandals. The government authorities have wanted to accept the public's suggestion to ban dancing several times, but they are reluctant to give up the huge tax revenue, so the word "ban dancing" is only a slogan. In fact, apart from dance halls, there is no essence to discuss in the civilization construction of the provisional capital. Recently, general business people have paid attention to hotels and restaurants, so they have successively built new-style hotels and restaurants, such as the Queen Hotel, Dahua Hotel, Huixian Building, Yongnianchun Hotel, and Standard Hotel, all of which have hundreds of millions of yuan of capital. There are still several under construction that have not been included. Currently, a single room costs 11,000 yuan, which is already a surprising price here, but "Shanghai customers" say that it is only one-third of the price in Shanghai, and they still call it cheap. It can be seen that there is no absolute expensiveness or absolute cheapness in this world. All the standards of expensive comfort depend on comparison and the evaluation of a few people.</p>
<p>Disappointment with Repatriation Transport</p>
<p>Speaking of repatriation transport, it is really disappointing. The government itself has not changed, saying that party, government, and military agencies can complete their repatriation within a limited time, and ordinary people certainly do not need to talk about it. A batch was indeed repatriated in the first phase, far before the government returned to the capital. In the second phase, in order to urgently relieve the disaster in Hunan and Hubei, all ships were transferred to transport grain. In the third phase, the military situation was tight, so the ships were transferred to military transport, and the number of planes was also reduced. Now it is the third phase, and there are still more than 300,000 people waiting for repatriation here. Reading the newspaper last month was also just this number, which shows that it has not decreased. With fewer repatriation ships, black market transactions have increased. The black market price for direct transport from Chongqing to Nanjing is 500,000 yuan. The price for planes varies depending on the urgency, with some at 1.5 million, some at 1 million, and the lowest at 560,000 yuan. Rich people come and go without stopping, so there is no difficulty. Those who are suffering cannot help but shout difficulties to the sky. The small civil servants and righteous people waiting for repatriation ships are constantly living a life of hunger and destitution. The urban area is very large, and people sitting in the room or those who have not personally experienced it will not understand or see their groans and sorrows.</p>
<p>Gloom Envelops Deformed Changes</p>
<p>Doesn't the public opinion know this? Even if you know, what is the use of saying a few cool words in the newspaper? What's more, people's hearts are now suddenly evil and everyone is afraid of things. Speaking of the press, the reporter can't help but feel ashamed because he is also one of them. The newspapers here rarely say a word for the people.</p>
<p>Everything in the provisional capital is changing in a deformed way. After the government returned to the capital, this sacred land, this great command platform, seemed to be shrouded in gloom. I hope that distant light will come to illuminate her, but "distant water cannot quench a nearby fire," and this hope will inevitably disappear in the dimness!</p>

<h3 id="e125">Black Rice and White Rice in Xi'an <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Li Chi, Xi'an Dispatch from Our Newspaper on the 5th</p>
<p>A police statistical report illustrates the social aspect of crime in Xi'an: In the first half of this year (January to the end of June), the city police bureau handled a total of 218 cases related to opium and drugs, involving 223 offenders. According to statistics released by the Shaanxi Provincial Security Command, during the same period, the department had adjudicated 245 similar cases within the city, sentencing 18 to death and a total of 174 to fixed-term or life imprisonment (the department adjudicated a total of 1,540 drug cases in outlying counties during the same period, sentencing 162 to death). Considering the statistics from the above two public security agencies, I cannot help but say that the thorough eradication of opium and drugs here is still a serious issue at present. At the same time, I firmly believe that the responsible authorities are determined to intensify enforcement, which explains the above figures. However, calculating the numbers, on average, one in every five hundred citizens is involved in drug cases within a year, which cannot help but be shocking and disheartening! The Shaanxi Provincial Anti-Opium Association and the Xi'an Municipal Branch have been established successively recently. Starting from the first day of next month, the branch will begin to implement rehabilitation work. For all those who are determined to quit drugs and apply on their own, the association will provide various conveniences. In addition, it can also provide relief to the families of those undergoing detoxification during the detoxification period, provide food and accommodation for the detoxifying persons themselves, and keep all secrets confidential. During the rehabilitation, if the person undergoing detoxification is reported by others, the association will also provide reasonable protection. This cannot be considered anything but a meritorious policy. It is said that Shaanxi Province has special difficulties in terms of the environment in implementing anti-opium policies, and the thorough solution to the problem may involve a scope beyond the sphere of anti-opium policy itself.</p>
<p>Everyone hopes to thoroughly eradicate the "black rice" of "opium addicts"; however, ordinary people hope that their "white rice" will be sufficient in quantity and lower in price. Unfortunately, the latter is contrary to expectations. Yesterday, the resident committee of the Provincial Assembly passed a temporary motion: "Recently, grain prices have been stable, and local flour prices have not increased, but various flour companies are suppressing the sale of their stockpiled flour, which is obviously hoarding, resulting in a sudden increase in the price of machine-milled flour, which has greatly stimulated general prices. It is proposed that the Provincial Government be consulted to investigate and deal with it quickly in order to calm the people..." Yesterday, the price of flour increased to 13,500 yuan per bag. Fortunately, the price of rice has remained stable after the increase. The Provincial Government recently sent a telegram to the special commissioner's offices and municipal governments of various districts, urging them to earnestly implement the grain price negotiation measures. The principle is to only allow legal grain merchants to operate grain and prohibit illegal merchants from concurrently engaging in the grain industry or hoarding for speculation.</p>
<p>"It is not easy to eat!" Standard salary for municipal teachers. This is "a drop in the bucket" for them, but for a person whose throat is parched and burning, there is nothing more precious than a cup of water. -- Water! The price per cart in Xi'an has recently increased from 190 yuan to 800 yuan; and one catty of flour can only be exchanged for two catties of charcoal!</p>
<p>The preparation for the Xi'an Municipal Waterworks seems to have been under consideration for a long time. Some people in the past assembly have also mentioned this matter, but due to the limited supply of equipment, it has been delayed. The recent concretization of preparations can be seen in the Provincial Government's passage of the proposal to establish a preparatory office for the waterworks. It is reported that the reason for revisiting this construction plan is that we have obtained more than a dozen sets of waterworks equipment from the U.S. military surplus materials. The Shaanxi Provincial authorities once went to Beijing to negotiate and were allocated one of them, which will be transported to Shaanxi and installed in Xi'an in the future. Insufficient lead wire pipes will be purchased separately. Equipment is no longer a problem, and the fundraising for capital is also not a problem.</p>
<p>This municipal project is also a "contribution" of the war: the roads in Xi'an are straight and long, and 80-90% of the intersections are perpendicular right-angled crosses. These three points already meet the standards of urban roads, but the road surface is poor, muddy and foot-sinking on rainy days, and yellow dust flies around on windy days. In order to improve the city's appearance and improve the road administration, the authorities have decided to allocate a large amount of asphalt from the Japanese military supplies received in Henan for the construction of asphalt roads in the city. When it is completed in the future, it may still be a pioneering undertaking in the northwestern cities. At present, the municipal government is starting to renovate fourteen roads, and tenders will be invited from merchants in the short term. Citizens are eager for these projects to be completed as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Starting from last night, the police strictly enforced nighttime measures. After midnight, any hawking or disturbing noises are prohibited on the streets, and residents without ID cards are prohibited from traveling on the streets after midnight to prevent the activities of unscrupulous elements. According to another report, some young children in the city have recently disappeared for no reason because illegal persons are designing to abduct and sell them. They have secretly set up institutions for trafficking in persons along the railway line. The authorities have paid close attention to this and will strive to protect the safety of citizens.</p>

<p>(1) Fei Wuji asks: Dear Editor, when I was studying in junior high school in my early years, I met female classmate B. The two were deeply in love, so they made an oral agreement to marry each other. Unexpectedly, the enemy invaded our hometown. Out of a strong sense of patriotism, I engaged in the war of resistance underground. When victory came, my mother betrothed Miss C to me without my consent since I was over twenty years old. Unexpectedly, two weeks later, female classmate B, who had been separated for four years, returned from the interior. After meeting, they both remembered the past and wanted to renew their marriage vows, but they were both already engaged at this time, and they were both adults, so they felt unresolved resentment. (2) If both parties request each other to terminate the engagement, if the other party does not agree to terminate it, can they automatically publish a notice in the newspaper to terminate it? (3) Is there any violation of the law? (4) If we get married with the consent of our parents, is there any violation of the law? (5) Do the other parties have the right to interfere and prosecute our engagement and marriage? (6) What other legal methods can be used to terminate it?</p>
<p>[Lawyer Fu Kuanglin replies] The six points mentioned in the letter are not clear and concise, so it is difficult to answer them separately in order. The following is a general answer: Marriage is the most important event in life and cannot be regarded as child's play. Although Article 972 of the Civil Code stipulates that it should be decided by the male and female parties themselves, it should not be like changing one's mind in the morning and evening, going back on one's words, arbitrarily engaging, and arbitrarily breaking off the engagement. This is not only contrary to ethics but also harmful to customs. Now that both parties (referring to Fei Jun and Miss B) are engaged to another person, they must first negotiate with the other party who has engaged to them and agree to terminate the engagement before both parties can re-engage. And they must pay considerable compensation to the non-negligent party. This damage is not limited to property damage. If the other party does not agree, (2) A loyal reader of this newspaper asks: A had a family. At the end of 1943, he met B (a prostitute), had a relationship with her, and then cohabited. A issued a letter of guarantee (without witnesses), stating that he would bear B's living expenses in exchange for B not returning to prostitution; otherwise, A could unconditionally break off the relationship with her, etc. In the spring of 1945, A saw B walking with another man, C, and learned that B was indeed having an affair, so he orally declared the termination of the cohabitation relationship to B's mother and B. B is still secretly engaged in prostitution. The other day, she suddenly asked someone to go to A's place to negotiate and demand compensation for losses. Now there are four questions. Please ask your lawyer to answer them: (1) If B sues in court, is this letter of guarantee valid? (2) If B sues A for abandonment in court and asks A for living expenses, is this crime established? Does A still have the obligation to pay living expenses? (If) If B makes a scene at A's place of service, what methods can be used to sanction her? (4) Can A's wife sue B in court for the crime of interfering with the family?</p>
<p>[Lawyer Fu Kuanglin replies] (1) If conclusive evidence can be obtained to prove that B is still secretly working as a prostitute, it is B who has destroyed the letter of guarantee herself, and A can no longer be bound by the letter of guarantee. (2) The crime of abandonment is not established. If B's behavior is as described in the previous paragraph, then A has no obligation to pay living expenses. (3) The method of sanctioning depends on the consequences of B's making a scene. (4) If A's wife did not know the truth beforehand and only now knows that B is having an affair with A and has obtained evidence of the adultery, she can sue B in court for the crime of interfering with the family.</p>

<h3 id="e130">Rejuvenating the Sericulture Industry in Guangdong <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>— He Zhiduan</p>
<p>(Continued)</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it was lost in the period when the West River was once occupied by the enemy. Therefore, the establishment of silkworm seed farms in our province is urgently needed. If cold storage is not easy to purchase immediately, the address of the seed production farm should be selected in a place with wind tunnels or caves, which are sufficient to naturally refrigerate the silkworm seeds to solve the current difficulty of lacking refrigeration equipment. In the past, farmers were limited by old habits and were not easy to accept the promotion of improved seeds. Now the situation is particularly special and seeds are scarce. Promoting improvements at this time can achieve twice the result with half the effort.</p>
<p>The places that should be added in the second phase: (1) Sericulture Guidance Office, to guide farmers in mulberry cultivation, silkworm rearing, silk reeling, silk business and raw silk trade, to organize young silkworm rearing rooms, public cocoon drying rooms, silk reeling cooperatives, raw silk transportation and sales cooperatives, and silk weaving cooperatives; (2) Silkworm Seed Elimination Office, to eliminate irregular seed producers and indiscriminately produce silkworm seeds, (3) Raw Silk Public Warehouse. In addition, regarding raw silk inspection institutions, the Commodity Inspection Bureau of the Ministry of Economic Affairs is responsible for this, so there is no need to add another one. The places that must be added in the third phase: (1) Sericulture Vocational School, to train practical middle and lower-level talents; (2) Sericulture Children's School, to train the children of sericulture practitioners to develop the next generation of sericulture backbone; (3) Silk Testing Farm, to engage in sericulture testing and research in the province to seek improvement.</p>
<p>4. Recruitment of Talents</p>
<p>The sources of sericulture talents in this province are as follows: (1) Graduates of the Sericulture Department of the Agricultural College of Sun Yat-sen University, totaling less than 40 people; (2) Provincial Zhongkai Agricultural School, each session of the Sericulture Department has a minimum of 10 graduates and a maximum of no more than 20 graduates. Up to now, there have been a total of 16 sessions, totaling less than 250 people; (3) Shunde Agricultural Vocational School, which has now been discontinued. The Sericulture Department of that school had only three sessions of graduates, totaling less than 50 people. This refers to the middle-level cadres of sericulture in this province. Secondly, there are sericulture training classes at the Agricultural College of Sun Yat-sen University and sericulture training classes at the Agricultural College of Lingnan University, which have now been discontinued. The number of technicians trained is not large. As for the specialized talents for upper-level leadership, there are only a few professors in the Sericulture Department of the Agricultural College of Sun Yat-sen University. It can be seen that the sericulture talents in this province are poor! Reflecting on the current situation, these specialized and technical talents</p>
<p>Due to the war, the sericulture industry in this province has been left without a place to use their talents, or due to the low salaries during the war, they have changed their minds and cannot stick to their jobs. There are even those who are unemployed and wandering around. This situation should not be allowed to continue in today's restoration and construction of the country. To fix the fold after the sheep is lost, on the one hand, talent registration must be carried out so that those who have changed careers and those who are unemployed can make the best use of their talents in the work of revitalizing the sericulture industry in this province. However, in the near future of high-speed development, this small number of talents is not enough. Even if training is intensified, it cannot be achieved immediately, but the revival of the industry is an urgent task for the economic construction of this province. It cannot be abandoned due to insufficient talents. There are two methods for short-term solutions:</p>
<p>1. Borrowing sericulture talents from Japan. The development of sericulture in Japan is noteworthy. The climate in the southern counties, such as Okinawa, is similar to that of Guangdong Province. During our country's war of resistance, the sericulture industry in this province was plundered and destroyed by the Japanese enemy. It is reasonable to use their talents to start from scratch.</p>
<p>2. Supplementing the lack of sericulture talents with other specialized talents. Sericulture often has close connections with natural sciences or applied technologies. For example, those who study fruit trees, forests, and crops can be responsible for mulberry cultivation technology; those who study biology and insects can be responsible for silkworm rearing and seed production technology; those who study agricultural chemistry, industrial chemistry, mechanical engineering, and factory management can be responsible for silk reeling or raw silk inspection technology; those who study agricultural economics and industrial economics can be responsible for cocoon and silk trade or sericulture administration. Therefore, the talents for the revival of sericulture are not limited to graduates of agricultural colleges, and talents in law, engineering, science, and business can also be recruited and employed. Based on the above methods, there is no need to worry about the lack of talents. In addition, the fundamental solution should be the establishment of secondary agricultural vocational schools, the supplementation and enrichment of agricultural colleges, and the establishment of training classes attached to various sericulture farms.</p>
<p>5. Expansion of Sericulture Areas</p>
<p>The distribution areas of the sericulture industry in this province can be divided into several regions:</p>
<p>1. The main distribution areas in the central region are as follows: Daliang, Rongqi, Guizhou, Liangjiao, Shuiteng, Leliu, Lecong, Yingzhou, Lunjiao, Longjiang, Longshan in Shunde County, Guanshan, Xiqiao, Jiujiang, Zhou, Shiwan, Luocun, Shatou, He in Nanhai County, the third, eighth, and ninth districts of Zhongshan County, Poshan, Shuikou, Yuetang, Qichong, Gulao, Weidun, and Nineteen Forts in Heshan County, the southwest city of Sanshui County, and the northeast of Xinhui County.</p>
<p>2. The main distribution areas in the western region are as follows: Lubu, Xitun, Bagui, Dongtun, Anhuai, and Sundong in Gaoyao County, Sanxiang, Liucun, Luohong, Ping'an, Shengping, and the county seat in Deying County, Jiancheng, Baixia, Liyuan, Xianping, Xiba, Shangsi, Sining, and Ducheng in Yunnan County, Wuqiang, Duqi, Zeyuan, Cushi in Yunfu County, Fucheng, Xiaduan, Zhongyi, and the county seat in Fengchuan County, and Fucheng, Pingxi, and Ganping in Luoding County.</p>
<p>3. The main distribution areas in the northern region are Lechang County and Qingyuan County.</p>
<p>4. The main distribution area in the eastern region is Huiyang County.</p>
<p>5. The main distribution areas in the southern region are Maoming County and Xuwen County.</p>
<p>Looking at the original sericulture areas, the central region is the most prosperous, followed by the western region, and the eastern, northern, and southern regions are extremely undeveloped. The central region is the Pearl River Delta, with an area of approximately 20,000 square li. It is a river alluvial plain with convenient irrigation and fertile soil. It is used to plant mulberry, hemp, rice, and sugarcane. It is an important agricultural area in this province. Planting drought-resistant and flood-resistant mulberry trees in fertile soil seems a pity in terms of land use. Also, due to the low and humid terrain, the mulberry leaves contain a lot of water during the plum rain season, and the silkworms are weak and prone to disease. Therefore, the second, third, and fourth crops are not easy to make, and the silk quality is also poor and difficult to store for a long time. However, this area has always been the main sericulture area in this province. Local silkworm farmers have skilled technology, experience in farming that has been eliminated, and a simple material foundation. Therefore, it still has value for maintenance. The western region is the counties along the West River. The distribution of sericulture is limited to the banks of the West River. The soil is deep and suitable for mulberry cultivation. However, unfortunately, there are floods along the river every year from June to September, which makes the mulberry leaves easy to turn into mud, which requires more labor to use as feed. Also, when the silkworm season is in full swing, the silkworm rearing room must also be moved. This is its disadvantage. Sericulture in this area is still in its infancy and requires greater efforts to develop it. The sericulture areas that need to be expanded are the eastern, northern, and southern regions. The northeastern regions are mountainous and have no floods. In addition to the sloping land that is suitable for forests, the slightly sloping land is not suitable for cultivating intensive crops and is extremely suitable for mulberry cultivation. The southern region is a flat slope with no end in sight, covering an area of approximately 30,000 square li. The soil is deep, weathered, and transparent, and most of it has been abandoned. It is very suitable for mulberry cultivation. In summary, maintaining the Pearl River Delta sericulture area, developing the West River sericulture area, and opening up the East River, North River, and South Road sericulture areas are the current key tasks.</p>
<p>6. Conclusion</p>
<p>The revival of the sericulture industry depends on precise planning, perfect organization, and sufficient financial resources. However, sericulture workers must have a high degree of professionalism and a sense of responsibility, value the interests of the country, and not hesitate to sacrifice themselves! In order to improve work efficiency, they must not only have passive behaviors such as public service, law-abiding, and breaking away from bureaucracy, but also give full play to their active service to the country and the nation.</p>
<p>Economic construction after victory is the main task of nation-building in the future. The sericulture industry in this province has suffered deep wounds in the short term, and its relationship with economic construction in the future is also very close. Therefore, no one warmly hopes that the agricultural and forestry authorities of this province will have a new understanding of this cause, quickly launch it, and truly improve it to revive the sericulture industry in this province with a new, fast, and practical spirit.</p>
<p>In the past month, there have been several things that have satisfied and excited enthusiastic sericulture practitioners: (1) Mr. Zhang Yujiu, advisor of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, and Mr. Wang Longsheng, a specialist member, flew from Chongqing to Guangdong to discuss the revival of sericulture with the provincial authorities; (2) Chairman Luo instructed the organization of the Guangdong Construction Research Committee, which is divided into three groups: economic, political, and cultural. We expect that the study of silk industry construction in this province in the future will not be ignored in the economic group; (3) The Agricultural and Forestry Bureau has been expanded and reorganized into the Agricultural and Forestry Office. The administrative organization has been expanded, so the effect of sericulture construction can also be enhanced; (4) The Guangzhou Commodity Inspection Bureau is about to start the inspection of exported raw silk, which will promote the improvement of raw silk quality internally and enhance international trade credit externally. We sincerely hope that after this prelude, there will be more active work to revive the sericulture industry in this province.</p>

<h3 id="e131">An Outline of Industrial and Business Management <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Baiyi</p>
<p>4.  Manufacturing</p>
<p>When a business organization is being organized, or after it is established, there should already be a plan for the goods to be produced. Many factories exist, some even using the name of the product as the factory name.</p>
<p>Therefore, the manufactured goods have a significant relationship with the organized business, because the goods determine the estimated annual turnover (market research referencing the sales of similar products), the type of factory and equipment needed, and the amount of capital required. These issues are important data for preparing a business plan. Many companies include a business plan when raising capital, so that investors believe there is great hope or potential profit in the future, and are happy to invest.</p>
<p>We are now going to discuss the issues that need to be considered at the beginning of the manufacturing process. These issues may already have been concretely planned when the business organization was started. Fortunately, everything is possible through human effort. As long as the various principles are known, they can be applied flexibly.</p>
<p>A. Product Design</p>
<p>Who is responsible for the design: Before manufacturing a product, the ideal product must be designed. Who is responsible for this design work varies depending on the business organization. If it is a manufacturing plant solely owned and operated by one person, then the owner can design it himself, or ask someone to design it, and then decide on it himself, which is the simplest. If it is a partnership or unlimited company, then it needs to be discussed by several people. If it is a limited company, and the manager has the power to handle it, then he will decide. If the board of directors attaches great importance to this aspect, then it should be discussed jointly by the board of directors. As a rule, the design of the goods greatly affects the sales of the goods, so the board of directors should carefully study and discuss it. Usually, the person in charge of production in a manufacturing plant is a factory manager, who is often an expert in the goods to be produced and released. Therefore, he can also competently design the goods.</p>
<p>Based on his knowledge, he can manufacture a perfect product, which will certainly be superior to the general products on the market. At the same time, the sales department responsible for promotion should also participate and provide opinions, because the person in charge of sales should be very familiar with the general situation of the market and the psychology of customers. He should contribute as much as possible for reference in the manufacturing aspect. Otherwise, if the factory managers only manufacture goods based on their knowledge, and they cannot be sold, it is equivalent to building a car behind closed doors.</p>
<p>Commercial competition is very fierce. For a business to exist and make a profit, it is necessary to manufacture goods seriously. Usually, before starting to manufacture milk powder, a milk powder manufacturer must buy all the milk powders on the market for reference, study their ingredients, effects, color, decoration, and price, and then formulate their own manufacturing standards, which will be jointly discussed and decided by the important figures in the company.</p>
<p>When deciding on the design of the goods, the following points should be considered:</p>
<p>A. Relationship to manufacturing: Each product has its own special needs. Some products require very complex machines, while others only require the use of labor. Even the same product can be made in several different ways, and the manufacturing costs of the different ways are different.</p>
<p>In order to obtain profits, a manufacturing plant should strive to reduce manufacturing costs. The most ideal thing is to use the lowest manufacturing cost to produce the highest standard of goods, because we want to reduce manufacturing costs without implementing a policy of cutting corners.</p>

<h3 id="e132">What is Art <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>— Zheng Wuchang</p>
<p>What is art? It seems difficult to explain this question. Let's say an artist is like a silkworm. The silkworm eats mulberry leaves and, when the time is right, it can spin silk. An artist is like a bee. The bee collects flower nectar, and after considerable work, it can make honey. Silk is silk, honey is honey. You can't say that silk is made from mulberry leaves, or that honey is made from flower nectar. But you can't deny that the silkworm's spinning of silk is related to eating mulberry leaves. The bee's honey-making uses flower nectar as a raw material. The silkworm's spinning silk is the silkworm's art; silk is its work of art. The bee's honey-making is the bee's art; honey is its work of art. My use of silkworms, mulberry, honey to explain art is of course a very superficial and crude analogy. Human talent, coupled with long-term cultivation, results in artistic food that is by no means as simple and limited as silkworms, mulberry, and honey. Therefore, what is discovered in artistic creation is naturally ever-changing, brilliant, and complex, each according to the artist's innate talent and acquired cultivation, and each has its own discovery of beauty. Therefore, an artist observes, appreciates, comprehends, and uses ingenuity on everything in nature to express his own unique beauty, to transcend nature without losing the truth and ultimate principles of nature, is what counts as art. Even in copying and transcribing the works of the ancients, one must digest the old and transform it, showing one's own emotions and skills. If it is not like this, if one writes about nature but only seeks to be the same as nature, if one copies the ancients but only seeks to be the same as the ancients, whether it is nature or the ancients, one can never copy or transcribe it in the same way; even if one can, it is nothing but nature, nothing but the ancients, and there is no me. For example, if the silkworm eats mulberry leaves, it is still mulberry leaves; if the bee collects flower nectar, it is still flower nectar. Why bother with this extra effort? What's the point? Photography is the most mechanical way to write about nature, but the framing, lighting, intention... all differ according to each person's skills and emotions, and the resulting works are distinguished by beauty and ugliness. As for drama, sculpture, calligraphy, and painting, in particular, one must go beyond the image to grasp the essence, and promote one's own unique life as beauty. Therefore, works that are mechanically copied or printed without the author's life are not considered works of art. Imitating, following in the footsteps, repeating sounds, and never finding one's own way out are not considered art. The true meaning of art lies in independently creating in a new direction towards beauty. Artists each have their own universe of truth, beauty, and goodness, solemn and beautiful, relying on your wisdom and your efforts to travel with the Creator.</p>

<p>The nature of painting and economics is not only completely different, but also very contradictory and mutually exclusive; but painting is not easy to sever ties with economics in any way, which seems to have a principle of mutual opposition and complementation.</p>
<p>It is commonly believed that painting is a noble art form, which should be very pure; painters are noble artists, who should be very noble, and should not haggle over every penny or be diligent for profit. Painters should paint for art, to express their own emotions and personal thoughts; they should not paint for a living, let alone work hard for money. In fact, among the countless painters throughout the ages, there are indeed a few who do not paint for money, for example:</p>
<p>(1) Emperors and nobles—at their leisure, they paint as they please. As rich emperors and nobles, they naturally do not need to exchange paintings for money.</p>
<p>(2) High officials and ministers—with light duties and a comfortable life, they use painting as a means of recreation.</p>
<p>(3) Wealthy merchants and gentry—owning vast lands and abundant jewels, they spend money lavishly and use painting as a means of attaching themselves to elegance.</p>
<p>(4) Poets and recluses—romantic and unrestrained, not engaged in production, aloof from the world, and never mentioning money, they use painting as a tool to express their feelings.</p>
<p>Of the above four types of people, the first three have money themselves and do not need to earn money by painting. The fourth type does not have money, but is naturally eccentric and does not like money. These people not only do not exchange paintings for money, but even if princes and nobles ask for them with money, they are even less willing to paint. On the contrary, if intimate friends or ordinary people ask for them casually, they are happy to paint. They do not care at all about their living needs. Apart from the above four types of painters and similar types, most painters cannot but rely on painting to maintain their livelihood. Relying on painting to maintain one's livelihood can also be divided into two types: wholesale and retail. For example, painters in the imperial court in past dynasties painted for the government for their whole lives, and received a monthly salary from the imperial court to make a living. It can be said to be a lifetime contract system. As for ordinary painters who sell paintings, they are all retail. They paint one painting for one purchase, and two paintings for two purchases. They are paid by the piece. "In leisure, I paint green hills, and do not let the world tarnish my heart." This is the self-expression of retail painters. "If you can't write a popular poem, then paint peonies." This is the painter's business strategy. In order to make a living, it is easy to lower the quality of one's paintings in order to cater to the customer's psychology. Now the imperial court has long been abolished, and the government has no spare money to support painters. Painters who make a living by painting only do retail. Retail can also be classified into types: one type is to create many works and hold exhibitions in order to sell them temporarily; the other type is to visit door to door selling one painting today and one painting tomorrow. Among these, the value of the works naturally varies greatly due to the quality of the works, the size of the reputation, and the amount of the price. However, they all make a living by selling paintings, and there are also many people who do not care much about the amount of remuneration, and still preserve a little romantic and refined nobility in maintaining their livelihood. Only those painters who haggle over every penny, are indifferent to their relatives, seek only profit, and have no feelings, who regard money as their life and books as goods, are really worse than merchants. It really makes people feel that "civilization has been swept away" and "elegance has been cut off."</p>
<p>Because painters cannot be separated from economics, the prosperity or decline of a country's economy has a great influence on the rise and fall of painting. Western countries such as Italy, France, England, Germany, Switzerland, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Spain all attach great importance to painting, and the lives of painters are generally not a problem. Once a painter becomes famous, not only do people in society buy his works, but also the government and museums compete to buy them.</p>
<p>Because painters cannot be separated from economics, they cannot be separated from the economic centers of cities. For example, Venice in ancient Italy, Paris in modern France, and London in England have become centers of Western painting. In China, when the economy follows politics, the capitals of past dynasties have become places where painting flourished and painters gathered. Beijing still has this phenomenon now. The most obvious place where the economy has developed independently and painting has followed is Yangzhou during the Qianlong and Jiaqing periods, and Shanghai since the late Qing Dynasty. Why are there so many painters in Shanghai now, like "crossing the river"? Although there are no accurate statistics, it is no exaggeration to estimate that painters in Shanghai account for half of the painters in the country! This is because Shanghai is the largest commercial port and the only economic center in China. There are many rich people, and there are many people who buy paintings. Naturally, painters "flock like water to a drain" to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Because Shanghai is the largest economic center in the country and the city with the largest population and area in the country, it is not only a place where "all talents gather," but also a place where "all merchants gather." All kinds of goods, whether new or old, Chinese or foreign, can be bought. When there are more talents, there are naturally opportunities for observation and competition; when there are more goods, there is naturally everything one needs. For example, in small cities in the interior, talents are naturally scarce and materials are scarce. Even in larger cities such as Jinan, Kaifeng, Nanchang, Fuzhou, and Xi'an, there are no more than five or six people who can paint well. There is often a shortage of paints and paper, and it is even more difficult to find oil paints and canvas for Western painting. In Shanghai, there are at least several hundred painters, and all the tools for painting, even silk for painting, can be said to be readily available, which provides great convenience for painters. People who live in Shanghai for a long time do not feel this way, but if you go to the interior, you will deeply feel it. During the Anti-Japanese War, I traveled in Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and Fujian for seven years, and I asked everywhere for Chinese painting materials but never bought any.</p>
<p>Because there are many painters in Shanghai, there are also many exhibitions. There are many antique shops and many families who collect ancient paintings. Therefore, it is very convenient to see new paintings and old paintings in Shanghai, followed by Beijing. In the West, Paris in France can be said to be the center of world art. There are more painter exhibitions than in Shanghai, especially the various art academies, museums, galleries, and individual exhibition rooms of famous painters established by the public and private sectors, which bring together great writers of all ages. It is really dazzling and beautiful. The construction of such art academies and the purchase of famous paintings require huge economic capabilities. In China, only the Palace Museum in Beijing spent a lot of money transporting thousands of ancient paintings back and forth during the Anti-Japanese War, which cannot be borne by private individuals. Therefore, if you want painting to develop, economic strength is a major condition that cannot be ignored.</p>
<h3 id="e134">Poetry in Painting, Painting in Poetry <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>— Jin Qijing</p>
<p>Some time ago, I went with Mr. Jiang Danshu to visit Mr. Xiao Wuquan. Mr. Xiao was Mr. Jiang's teacher, so I should call him Great Teacher. In his simple studio, I saw a very extraordinary couplet, which was Zheng Yuan's birthday couplet for Mr. Xiao: "There is poetry in painting, and there is calligraphy in poetry; there is no Dao outside of man, and there is no man outside of Dao." The sentences were natural and perfect, truly seamless, and gave me a deep impression at the time.</p>
<p>Su Dongpo once commented on Wang Wei, saying: "Mo Jie's paintings have poetry in them, and Mo Jie's poems have paintings in them." In fact, poetry in painting is not only true of Wang Wei, but also of many poets since the Tang and Song dynasties, who also have many famous lines that can be used for this. For example: "Green trees surround the village, and green mountains lean outside the city; A distant autumn sail on the Green Maple River, ancient trees sparse on the edge of White Emperor City; The mountain emerges from the wind and clouds, the sky slopes low at the end of the plains; The stream turns green, rolling the water on the flat dyke, the forest is missing, and green separates the mountains on the other shore." Which of these famous lines is not a painting? All poems that describe scenery must have a sense of painting.</p>
<p>As for painting in poetry, just look at more famous paintings from the Song and Yuan dynasties and experience them, and there are many examples that cannot be enumerated. For example: Dong Beiyuan's "Dragon Lodging in the Countryside", Xia Yuyu's "West Lake in Spring Dawn", Li Di's "Returning Home in Wind and Rain", Ma Qinshan's "Wine Cup and Bright Moon", Huang Shijiu's "Dwelling in the Fuchun Mountains", Wang Huanghe's "Spring Farming in the Valley", Ni Yunlin's "Rongxi Zhai Tu", Wu Zhonggui's "Fisherman", Mi Nangong's "Cloud Mountain", Leng Pengtou's "High Pavilion", Qiu Shizhou's "Waiting for Crossing in Autumn River", Tang Ziwei's "Pine Sounds on the Mountain Road", and many other famous works, which one does not have poetic meaning? However, most of the famous works after the Yuan Dynasty were inscribed by the authors themselves, who directly expressed the essence and poetic meaning of the paintings, creating a unity of poetry and painting. Otherwise, the paintings with poetry are more thought-provoking! When we look at Mr. Xiao's paintings, they are grand and magnificent, often capturing thousands of miles of the Yangtze River in a small space, as if they were Han Changli's articles, with endless charm, naturally worthy of the famous line "poetry in painting".</p>
<p>Mr. Xiao is over eighty years old this year and can be called the head of the contemporary painting world. The Qing Dynasty painting history of Youzheng Bookstore says of him: "He traces the Song and Yuan dynasties, and takes nature as his teacher." His landscapes are indeed vigorous and profound, opening up new paths. His disciples are all over the north and south, standing tall as a great master of the contemporary era. Ni Yunlin praised Wang Shuming, saying: "Wang Youcheng's brush is exquisite and his ink is wonderful, he calms his mind and lies down to tour the landscape, following Zong Shaowen. Shuming's brushstrokes can lift a tripod, and there has been no such person in five hundred years." In the five hundred years of Wang Shuming's era, which was the golden age of our country's painting, were there no painters who could compete with Wang Shuming? It can be seen that the ancient custom of friendship was very simple and sincere, and the praise of peers was like this. Therefore, Zheng Yuan's praise of Mr. Xiao was also an expression of this spirit. Mr. Xiao himself said in the preface to the second collection of his paintings, which was published ten years ago: "I have been learning to paint for more than fifty years, and I deeply know that this way is difficult to speak of." He has experienced fifty years of painting, and is still as humble as a valley, which is in line with the meaning of the old man Gengyan's saying: "I only understood the method of green and blue after fifty years," and there is a subtle similarity in their views. As the saying goes: "After learning, you know your inadequacy." Mr. Xiao's painting way does have the true meaning of the Buddhist saying "As a person drinks water, he knows whether it is cold or hot." It is definitely not comparable to the general academic paintings that are common nowadays. The famous line "There is no Dao outside of man, and there is no man outside of Dao" has long been deeply imprinted in my mind.</p>
<p>Hua Xinluo, a native of Fujian, is good at flowers and plants, and his landscapes are especially beautiful and vigorous. He lived in Hang County and died at home at the age of eighty. Xinluo's flowers and plants occupy an important position in the art world of the late Qing Dynasty, and are equal to Futang, Nantian, and Qingxiang. The right picture and the previous ones are all his masterpieces. Xu Bangda recognizes.</p>
<h3 id="e135">Zheng Manqing in the Last Thirty Years <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>— Lou Xinkun</p>
<p>Manqing is a native of Yongjia. He was clever as a child, and the villagers regarded him as a child prodigy. He was known for his poetry, calligraphy, and painting at an early age, and it is appropriate that he was valued by the art world. It was the fifth year of the Republic of China when Manqing traveled to Hangzhou. I lived on the lake and had a previous connection with him. Living together day and night, I saw his paintings, which were interesting and profound. I admired his extraordinary talent and respected him as a close friend. I wanted to seek a long-term friendship, but Manqing returned east after living there for more than a year. In the autumn of the tenth year, he was re-hired by the Beijing Academy of Fine Arts and Yuwen University to teach poetry and painting. After several years, he returned to Shanghai and became the head of the Chinese painting department of the Shanghai Academy of Fine Arts. From then on, his art became more refined, and he created naturally, and he was regarded as the leader of the Yongjia school. Wu Changshuo sighed that it was an absolute art, similar to Tianchi Xuege, and able to absorb its essence and remove its dross, which is truly no exaggeration. In the eighteenth year, the elders in Shanghai thought that the quintessence of the country was declining day by day, and that it would be useless if there were no talents as capable and experienced as Manqing to come forward to advocate for it. Therefore, they invited him to gather like-minded people and establish the Chinese Academy of Literature and Art. For a time, the rising stars all came from his school. Who knew that Manqing, in addition to the three perfections, devoted himself to studying the classics, and had been in the hall of Mr. Qian on famous mountains for many years. He also had a wide understanding of medicine and Tai Chi, and had a deep understanding of the profound principles, expressing what previous people had not said. In the twenty-sixth year, when the Sino-Japanese War broke out, Manqing moved west with the national army. After ten years of being praised, he suddenly returned, and he has never slackened in his work. The poet's inspiration is simple and unrestrained, making people look up to him. Why wait for tedious words? After the disaster, we meet again, and he presents dozens of fine works for the people of Shanghai to appreciate. What is his impact on the revival of art? I have described Manqing's simple history of the last thirty years in this way, which I hope will be pleasing to those who admire Manqing.</p>
<h3 id="e136">The Early Movement of Opera <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>— Song Shouchang</p>
<p>Opera was born in Florence, northern Italy, at the end of the 16th and the beginning of the 17th centuries. At that time, the Renaissance was in full swing. Music was also inspired, and a group of poets and musicians who admired Greek art gathered at the mansion of Count Giovanni Bardi to engage in the revival movement of ancient Greek tragedies. They returned the complex counterpoint music of the Middle Ages to simplicity, abandoning counterpoint and trying harmony, imitating the form of popular music at the time, and adding harmonic accompaniment to the monophonic songs. Their earliest works were Dafne, created by Jacopo Peri (1561-1633), Rinoceini, and Ginlre Carcini (1550-1618), a short and poetic work. The subject matter was taken from mythical stories. "Dafne" was staged in Florence in 1597 and achieved considerable success, but it was still experimental and not performed publicly. The second work, Euricice, was performed publicly in 1600 to celebrate the wedding of Duke Henry IV, attracting general attention. The organization and form of this work were derived from the madrigals popular in the 16th century. Because madrigals were considered unsuitable for dialogues between characters in dramas, in addition to the old-style chorus, recitative and accompaniment of several instruments were added. From then on, the singer expressed emotions based on the natural tone of the language, without being restricted by music. This kind of song tune sounds like spoken language, but it is still melodic, and the effect of the opera is greatly enhanced.</p>
<p>After opera was produced in Florence, this new art movement influenced Venice, and Italian opera gradually developed. In Venice, Claudis Monterverdi (1567-1643) made the greatest contribution to opera. His works can be said to be the ancestor of modern music. He was a great genius musician who boldly applied dissonant sounds, expanded the orchestral structure in opera, and created the Tremolo of stringed instruments to enhance the effect of the drama. Regarding the expression of drama, he paid special attention to the fusion of music and drama, and used the timbre and characteristics of different instruments to describe as much as possible. His famous works include Orfeo, Ariannu, and Tancredi. These works are much more advanced than the first opera Dafne, using an orchestra of thirty-nine instruments for accompaniment, and its melody and harmony are very beautiful and expressive. Since the effect of stringed instruments was used in opera, orchestral beauty gradually progressed with the development of opera. From then on, instrumental music was not only used for accompaniment but also often played independently in the overture of the opera.</p>
<p>By the second half of the 17th century, the center of Italian opera moved from Venice to Naples in southern Italy. Opera underwent a reform movement, which was characterized by emphasizing the melodic beauty of the songs in the play. The leader of this school was Alessandro Scarlatti (1659-1725). He created an Italian-style overture and added it before the opening of the opera, using musical performances to hint at the content of the opera to be performed. This overture was composed of three musical movements: fast, slow, and fast. In terms of form, it is actually a pure instrumental music, and the symphony of later generations evolved from this form. He made special contributions to vocal music. He believed that the Florentine school of opera only focused on recitative and ignored melody, so he created an aria to remedy its shortcomings, and the melody of singing became more and more beautiful and lyrical.</p>
<p>Later, the Italian opera revival movement spread to other parts of the European continent, and France, England, Germany and other countries responded. Among them, the works created by Giouanni Lalli (1632-1684), the music director of the court of Louis XIV of France, were more prominent. He focused on the application of ballads and worked hard to harmonize the lyrics and music, and the French-style overture was also completed by him. A musical work was established using a slow movement, a fast fugue, and a dance finale.</p>
<p>In summary, the above is about the development of the Italian opera revival movement. The evolution of the forms of madrigals, recitatives, arias, and ballads, which are related to the long tones of the main music, has gradually developed the accompaniment of harmony. In terms of instrumental music, the creation of overtures has laid a foundation for the orchestra, and then the form has been expanded to establish pure instrumental music, which has influenced the generation of symphonies in the future. These developments in the form of the main music have given great help.</p>

<h3 id="e137">Public Bidding <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>— Shaofu</p>
<p>Our city has a large number of enemy and puppet properties. It is said that the disposal bureau will publicly bid for them. However, there is a caveat, which is "except for those approved for valuation and transfer and those allocated by order." This caveat includes a lot of content. Let’s put it aside for now and talk about public bidding first.</p>
<p>Although the newspapers have not mentioned the housing shortage much recently, we know that the housing shortage in our city is still very serious, and it has not been resolved or alleviated just because it is not mentioned. The municipal authorities even have plans to allocate special funds to build citizen housing and to order landowners to build houses. This proves that Shanghai has not yet reached the state of "more houses than people."</p>
<p>However, it is really strange to say that although there are not more houses than people, in fact, the current situation of more houses than people has been created. How can this be said? It turns out that those who really need houses are unable to get houses, while a small number of wealthy people control a large number of houses and hoard them for speculation, talking about gold bars, US dollars, key money, deposit refunds, etc. On the one hand, they cannot afford gold bars and US dollars, so they have nowhere to live; on the other hand, it is not easy to get gold bars and US dollars, so the houses are left empty.</p>
<p>Today's Shanghai has such a contradictory phenomenon.</p>
<p>A large number of enemy and puppet properties are publicly bid for. Who can bid for them? Is it you? Is it me? It is very obvious that it is the very few wealthy people. Do these very few wealthy people really bid for them to live in themselves? No! They already have very comfortable foreign houses. Therefore, it is not difficult for us to imagine that the so-called public bidding for enemy and puppet properties is just helping a few people get rich, supporting the prevailing gold bar and US dollar key money system in Shanghai, and making most people homeless.</p>
<p>If the government's policy is to help a few people get rich, if the government's policy is to support the gold bar and US dollar key money system, most of us will have to be homeless.</p>
<h3 id="e138">Where to Save Knowledge: Where are the Children Outside the School Gate Going? <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>— Lü Tian</p>
<p>For the sake of their children's schooling problems, I have visited several schools and asked friends to write many letters of introduction, but everywhere I went, the "no admittance" sign was hung high, "Sorry, there are no places available, we cannot serve you properly." The seriousness of the school shortage has put the education bureau in a difficult situation to deal with. Children cannot study, and parents are even more anxious. It has been a year since the victory, and children cannot even study. How serious is this problem!</p>
<p>The problem of the housing shortage lies not in the scarcity but in the inequality, but the school shortage is really because there are too few schools and not enough classes. Since the recovery of Shanghai, the population has been increasing rapidly. Due to financial and other technical problems, the number of schools cannot be increased in proportion to the increasing population, so everywhere there are too many students and too few places available. In order to adapt to the current situation and alleviate the severity of the school shortage, the "half-day system" should be universally adopted immediately; students spend half a day at school and half a day at home, concentrating the courses in the half-day at school, and moving after-school work and rest to the half-day at home. In this way, one classroom can accommodate two classes of students, and a school that could only enroll 500 students can now enroll 1,000. I cannot say how good the half-day system is, but at least, the schooling problems of many students - especially primary school students - can be solved.</p>
<p>Regarding the implementation of the half-day system, there are a few more points that need to be explained:</p>
<p>(1) Fully utilize space: The central problem of the school shortage is finance, and school buildings account for the center of finance. After the implementation of the half-day system, in the same classroom, Class A attends class in the morning and Class B attends class in the afternoon. People can take turns to rest, and space is fully utilized.</p>
<p>(2) Save material resources: Currently, the education authorities cannot balance school funding and actual expenses. After the implementation of the half-day system, the number of classes will increase, and the class funding of a school must be allocated in full, but the ordinary expenses such as rent, water, and electricity will not increase by half due to the increase of half the classes. In this way, overall payment can reduce part of the imbalance between income and expenditure.</p>
<p>(3) Improve teachers' treatment: Currently, an average of about one and a half teachers are responsible for one grade in primary schools. After the implementation of the half-day system, because of the concentration of class affairs, one teacher can be responsible for one grade. Teachers are certainly more hard-working, but their treatment can be improved. In this way, the allocation of funding for each grade is still the usual practice for the authorities, but it is a small compensation for teachers. In today's situation where teachers' treatment cannot match the social cost of living index, it can also give them a little relief.</p>
<p>The main purpose of implementing the half-day system is to eliminate the current pathological state of insufficient primary school classes. Please, enlightened education administrative authorities, formulate methods as soon as possible and submit them for implementation to save the children who are wandering outside the school gate and cannot enter!</p>
<h3 id="e139">The World of Gods and Monsters <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>— Tianyi</p>
<p>The inventions in the world now are somewhat similar to the various things in gods and monsters novels (such as The Burning of the Red Lotus Temple, Journey to the West, and Investiture of the Gods).</p>
<p>For example, in these gods and monsters novels, the most common and well-known thing is that those swordsmen and immortals can spit out flying swords and take people's heads from thousands of miles away, or with a wave of their hands, a white light will go out. However, during this war, London, England, was often attacked by Germany's V1 and V2, and Meteor missiles. These Meteor missiles all flew from distant Germany, and their tails also had white light. Isn't this somewhat like flying swords?</p>
<p>Secondly, there are those immortals and swordsmen who can stand in the clouds and watch the lower world, watching everything in the lower world. However, today there is the invention of direct-landing airplanes, and it is also like the characters in The Burning of the Red Lotus Temple who often unleash palm thunder. Today, there are atomic bombs controlled by wireless radio. In Investiture of the Gods, there are two people, Flying Sky and Drilling Earth. Flying Sky is already known to everyone, there are airplanes, and Drilling Earth can enter tunnels (this is not yet available in our country, but it has long been available in European and American countries). Furthermore, there are some swordsmen and immortals who can fight fiercely in the water for seven days and seven nights. This has long been replaced by warships and submarines!</p>
<p>Also, in Investiture of the Gods, there are two people, Thousand-Mile Eyes and Wind-Following Ears. Thousand-Mile Eyes has a telescope, and today it is further advanced with the invention of wireless radio facsimile machines. Wind-Following Ears is still replaced by wireless radio.</p>
<p>However, so far there does not seem to be an invention that can match Sun Wukong's somersault - 108,000 miles.</p>
<p>In short, the world now is already like those swordsmen and immortals in old gods and monsters novels who are fighting treasures. It depends on who has more magic weapons and whose magic weapons are more powerful, and whoever can be king.</p>
<h3 id="e140">Can't Live Anymore! <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>— Pingjing</p>
<p>Teachers, this sacred and noble profession, are the gardeners of the nation's tender seedlings, the nannies of the new generation. Every advanced country attaches great importance to the status of teachers. Because the fate of the country in ten or twenty years lies in the hands of the teachers who are gardeners and nannies today.</p>
<p>However, in our China, it is a bit different. Teachers cannot even get some stability in their lives, and they are always shouting that they cannot live anymore! Humph! Smart people all think that being a teacher is a dead end. Only fools want to do it.</p>
<p>Fortunately, at the beginning of the War of Resistance against Japan and the founding of the country, the government authorities immediately and correctly put forward the slogan "Education First in the Founding Period." At the same time, many places also launched movements to respect teachers. But, sadly, how much can two beautiful and pleasant slogans help? How much has a one-time charitable "respect for teachers" improved the status of teachers?</p>
<p>Teachers' treatment is not as good as that of rickshaw pullers, workers, or vendors. Mr. Tao deeply lamented and said: "Also taking care of children for people, life is not as good as a nanny." Then, is the value of teachers' work not even as good as that of soldiers, workers, vendors, and nannies? Friends! Please calculate it again! In the founding period, in what place should teachers rank?</p>
<p>Teachers are people, not "supermen." They also have families and they also have to live. Are we really going to let teachers eat "sacred food" and wear "noble clothes" for a lifetime?</p>
<p>Teachers are leaving. Many teachers want to desert from the education ranks. Are we really going to let the education world be filled with scummy teachers? Alas! How many good teachers are still sticking to their posts and remaining unswerving?</p>
<p>According to general estimates, at least 80% of the teachers engaged in primary school education are young female teachers without family burdens. Of course, I am not saying that female teachers are not suitable for education. There are indeed many education warriors among female teachers who are enthusiastic about education. However, we can clearly see that male teachers are gradually retiring. Their living burdens make it impossible for them to exist in the education world. They have the ambition to dedicate their lives to education, but the whip of life constantly urges them, causing them to painfully gradually withdraw from the education world.</p>
<p>Although the local education authorities have also promulgated the laws and regulations of the Private School Economic Open Organization Funding Review Committee in order to improve teachers' treatment, stipulating that all tuition income should be used as teachers' salaries and distributed equally and reasonably, the facts tell us that in addition to a few enlightened principals who are willing to follow the regulations automatically, another part of the school owners who profit from the school still turn a blind eye or use various methods to cover up, such as adding nominal positions, etc. If teachers really want to strive for it, well, this will lay the main cause for dismissal at the end of the semester. Most teachers are still silent.</p>
<p>Therefore, we hope that the education authorities should put forward more effective methods to strictly check at any time whether private schools are complying with the laws, because in this city, private schools still account for the majority of schools in the city. Those responsible for schools who disregard the laws should be severely punished.</p>
<p>At the same time, regarding the method of paying private school teachers' salaries in one lump sum at the beginning of the semester, we hope that the education authorities can also announce it in the shortest possible time. Our reasons are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The school authorities collect the tuition fees in one lump sum. And when collecting tuition fees at the beginning of the semester, the standard is roughly not far from the ratio of usual prices. However, by the end of the semester, half a year has passed, and price fluctuations are too severe. For example, a salary of 50,000 at the beginning of the last semester (economically open schools are probably around this number, but some schools actually have 5,000 without food and accommodation) can buy about four piculs of rice, but by the end of the semester, 50,000 salary cannot even buy one picul of rice.</p>
<p>(2) Avoid increasing the burden on parents and collecting tuition fees a second time in the middle of the semester, because the salary is paid in one lump sum, the teachers can decide on a semester's plan, and their lives can be slightly guaranteed. Why collect tuition fees a second time?</p>
<p>(3) If the principal is worried about teachers resigning in the middle of the semester, they can take security money and guarantee. Anyway, the amount guaranteed is only the small amount of salary for one semester. In case of resignation in the middle of the semester, the guarantor will of course compensate for the loss.</p>
<p>(4) Or if it is thought that there is no precedent for this in other occupational sectors and public schools, it should be known that the allocated number of private school teachers' salaries in a semester has been stipulated, and there will never be the possibility of adjustment or extra income, such as teacher respect money and collecting tuition fees a second time. These can only be said to be remedial measures after the panic of teachers' lives, so why not prevent it before the start of the semester?</p>
<p>We hope that the above suggestions will be considered by the education authorities, and we hope that teachers, principals, parents, and students will discuss them together and make corrections, so as to reduce the sadness of teachers even by a little bit. Teachers will be fortunate! Education will be fortunate! The country will be fortunate!</p>

<p>Middle school tuition is 200,000, university is 300,000, public funding for national universities is reduced to 30%, and the entrance examination is more difficult than ascending to heaven. The country has not arranged a path for young people to take. Where should young people go?</p>
<p>The treatment of female workers in yarn factories is more than 200,000 per month. A female English professor at a famous national university is also only 200,000 per month. If it is solely for living, all the professors will change their careers.</p>
<p>Last year, overseas Chinese were massacred. If we had moved troops westward and given a slight punishment at that time, the tragedy of massacring overseas Chinese would definitely not have happened again in various parts of the world.</p>

<p>In the morning, in a very crowded tram, a man "sitting" by the window suddenly put his head in his hands and covered his eyes with his hands. The people next to him asked, "Are you sick? I have ready-made medicine, do you want to take it?"</p>
<p>"No, no," the man replied, "It's really because I saw those old ladies standing there, being crowded by people, and I feel very sad in my heart!"</p>
<p>After Lai's husband died, Lai was very sad. In the cemetery, she almost fainted from grief. In the car on the way back, she was still crying loudly. Her friend couldn't help but persuade her: "Hey! Don't be too sad. Actually, it doesn't matter much. Although it is indeed making you very sad now, after six months, when you meet a middle-aged wealthy businessman, in the blink of an eye, you will get married again!"</p>
<p>Lai said angrily: "Six months! You bastard, what am I going to do tonight?"</p>
<h3 id="e144">A Few Words to Fathers (Part 1) <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>— Zhou Shang</p>
<p>"We must ensure that the next generation is stronger in body than us, superior in intelligence than us, and surpasses us in moral character!"</p>
<p>Father means baba, dieye, or yeye. Ji Yun: "The Wu people call father ba." Zheng Zi Tong: "Barbarians call elders baba or baba, later people added the radical for 'father' to create the character ba." Nan Shi: "Die, means father." Song Shi, Biography of Zong Ze: "Common people call father yeye."</p>
<p>Although Father's Day has passed, I still want to say a few words to fathers about the "Way of the Father." In ancient books, there are terms like mother as teacher, maternal education, maternal model, and maternal example, but for a time, no equivalent for "the Way of the Father" could be found. Today's education only teaches people how to make a living and how to do things, but it doesn't teach people how to be a father. Normal school education only teaches people how to be teachers of other people's children, and it doesn't teach them how to be their own children's teachers. Some gentlemen in Shanghai are promoting Father's Day. I think the meaning of this holiday should not be for children to respect their fathers, but rather to talk more about fatherly education, so that those who have become fathers but still don't know how to be one can think about it.</p>
<p>The main topic of fatherly education is "the Way of the Father." The object of the Way of the Father is children. The upbringing of children is the mother's responsibility, but it is also the father's responsibility. In ancient times, it was said that "the mother toiled," because the scholars themselves raised their sons. But nowadays, in addition to being good wives and mothers, women also work in national professions. They carry the double burden of being both father and mother, especially at present, they are living a destructive life of "burning the candle at both ends." The traditional Chinese women's outlook on life is based on the spirit of self-sacrifice, working like oxen and horses without expecting rewards, enduring a hundred times, enduring silently until death. But fathers should also understand this and share the responsibility of raising children. Do not just hold a cigar, sit in an easy chair, look at your nose, speak official jargon to your wife, or even frequent prostitutes, gamble, eat extravagantly, and live a life of dissipation, treating the family as a temporary residence.</p>
<p>Today's children are the source of the nation's life and the reserve force for national construction. The future prosperity and strength of a nation depends on whether the children of that nation are healthy now. Goujian implemented the internal policy of "ten years of reproduction, ten years of training." These two major tasks mostly belong to the Way of the Father. The minimum requirement of the Way of the Father is to ensure that the next generation is stronger in body than us, superior in intelligence than us, and surpasses us in moral character, so that the next generation is stronger than their grandfathers and ancestors, and that the next generation is full of outstanding talents for the future nation.</p>
<p>To realize the above, we must focus on the Way of the Father. To focus on the Way of the Father, we must first pay attention to the following four things concerning children: first, health protection; second, moral cultivation; third, knowledge development; and fourth, marriage guidance. Now, please learn from me:</p>
<p>1.  Health Protection—Only a nation with first-class physical health can build a first-class country. If a nation is to have a golden age of culture, its people must first have a golden age of physical health thirty years earlier. If you want your children to have great ambitions, do great things, and become famous in later generations, you must first nurture them to have a strong and healthy body. In ancient times, the practice of "archery and chariot driving" had a profound meaning, embodying national defense in self-defense. Health is divided into two aspects: mental and physical, and they influence each other. A foundation must be laid from an early age, and special attention must be paid to every stage from conception to university studies. Fathers should take care of their mothers' lives during pregnancy, especially their diets. The superstitious "prenatal education" of the past is actually "prenatal nourishment," because the fetus's nerves are not related to the mother's body, so there is no way to teach it. Only blood vessels are connected to the mother's body, allowing it to absorb food. Children's baby teeth and permanent teeth are rooted and developed in the early stages of conception. With appropriate nutrition, their teeth will be strong. Also, if children are abused when they are young, they are more likely to develop mental illness or even commit suicide when they grow up. These are just a few examples. The period from a child's birth to five years old is really the nutrition period; six to twelve years old is the period of large muscle exercise; and only after twelve years old do they enter the stage of knowledge cultivation. As a father, one should thoroughly understand this and nurture and protect them with caution.</p>
