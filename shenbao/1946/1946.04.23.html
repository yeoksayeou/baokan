<h3>馬歇爾周恩來晤談　對東北休戰曾提討論</h3>
<p>〔本報重慶廿二日電〕馬歇爾元帥返渝已五日，在此五日中，引起各方人士之普遍焦慮，據聞，廿二日上午馬氏與周恩來氏約晤，下午五時半美大使館代辦蘇斯邁邀約各黨派負責人在美大使館晚餐，介紹渠等與馬帥夫人相識，三人軍事小組何時可開尙難預測，惟此次馬帥能與周恩來約晤，一般僉信對東北問題可露一綫曙光。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山廣播：共黨代表周恩來今與馬歇爾會晤，聞已提出東北無條件休戰要求。</p>
<p>〔聯合社重慶廿二日電〕馬歇爾特使本日下午曾與蔣主席會談，內容不詳。</p>
<p>〔合衆社重慶廿二日電〕軍事三人小組共產黨代表周恩來，今日與馬歇爾特使會商二小時半，說明共產黨之立塲，聞馬氏聆聽後並米置評。周恩來與馬歇爾談話內容雖未予以披露，但共產黨方面顯示，此次討論與共產黨最近主張政府必須無條件停止東北衝突一點，有密切關係。因目下共產黨已佔有優越軍略地位，設國軍欲以武力奪取其土地，勢必演成血戰。馬氏本日下午並曾與軍政部次長兪大維會商，兪氏允許通力合作。</p>
<p>〔又電〕報載：由於長春之被佔，局勢愈總複雜嚴重，但相信政府與馬歇爾間之會談，將導入和平解決途徑。一般以爲，共軍將力圖防守長春，並在其統洽區內，開發天然資源，備作日後之用，是以通常之調解努力能吾成功，極可懷疑。畏春被佔後，馬歇爾及吉倫將軍對共黨之政軍謀略，已獲一深刻之新見解，故預料此次馬氏所提停止衝突方式，將與以前之協議逈不相同。並聞馬歇爾已疑就一解決東北事件之計劃，更料雙方均將在停止衝突令頒布前，全力爭取土地之控制。</p>
<h3>蔣主席在紀念週致訓　指示還都各事宜　首批外交團人員由渝抵京</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿二日電〕還都及國民大會之是否如期實現，爲當前舉國矚目之兩大事件，截至今日，由此問種種跡象以觀，充分證明日來外間所傳行將延緩之說，絕無根據。國大籌委員負責人洪闌友今日公開表示，該處並未作可以稍緩籌備工作之任何指示，反之，該處同人，日內將加開夜班，冀使即將開幕之盛會，於事務方面，力臻盡善盡美。今日已有遠自豫陝之代表廿餘人專機到達，其他各地代表均預吿行程，日內亦陸續來京。國府路國民大會堂左右及對面，數十工人正在趕搭木質彩牌樓，氣象宏偉。至還都日程，雖因東北戰事。而將空運計劃稍有更動，但預料本月廿五日至月杪前之五天中，將達最高潮，蓋蔣主席於廿四日接受陪都各界之盛大歡送，並飛蓉一二天之後，可能於月杪返京。</p>
<p>〔中央社重慶廿二日電〕中樞廿二日上午九時紀念週，蔣主席領導行禮後，行總副署長浦薛鳳，報吿該署最近工作情形畢，蔣主席對還都事宜，有所指示：（一）各院部會公務人員及其眷屬，於還都時有特殊困難者，各主管應斟酌情形，代爲解決之，幷予救濟。（二）目前交通工具缺乏，各主管對於人員檔案之運送，應分別先後緩急，其與業務無重要關係之人員與檔案，可新留重慶，俟水運暢通時，再行運赴京。最後勉各公務人員以八年前遷都重慶之精神，還都南京，憂勤惕勵，奮勉努力。</p>
<p>〔又電〕中央常委段錫朋今晨自渝飛京，主持中央訓練委員會工作，同時飛京者，尙有政院水利委會主委薛篤弼，該會重要人員，多已先行赴京，其餘人員、月底亦可還都。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京廿廿二日電〕首批還都外交使團人員，廿二日下午二時半自渝飛抵首都，到美使館文化專員費慰梅女士，二等秘書梅爾　及隨員等五人，英使館一等秘書郭德思，二等秘霄麥耿思等五人。</p>
<h3>府委與國大代表名單　共黨仍拒絕提出　張羣等函復周恩來請注意責任</h3>
<p>〔合衆社重慶廿二日電〕共產黨本日正式宣稱：彼等曾要求在改組之行政院中獲部長四席，國府委員會中十席，俾連同民主同盟之票數，獲一否決權。該公告指陳：在各種問題如柬北停止衝突及政府對上述席數是否接受等問題未獲解決前，共產黨不能發表其政府與國大代表之名單。據共黨方面透露：參加政府之代表業經選定，但例如政治自由，協商會議決議之實行等問題不穫解決，則延安不擬將代表名單提出，某發言人謂：如問題解決，共黨所派國大代表，仍可於五月五日前到達南京，共黨人員移京之期未定，但「若蔣主席與馬歇爾將軍移往南京，則爲工作計，周恩來亦必須赴京也」。</p>
<p>〔中央社重慶廿二日電〕周恩來廿一日函政府代表張羣·邵力子·張厲生三氏，並附中國共產黨代表聲明，說明目前不能考慮參加國民政府之人選及提交國民大會之名單，張羣·邵力子·張厲生三氏當即函復，茲錄原函如下：恩來先生惠鑒，昨接四月廿一日大函及所附貴黨代表團聲明，當已轉達哲生（孫科）鐵城（吳鐵城），亮嚎（王寵惠），雪艇（王世杰），立夫（陳立夫）諸先生，弟等一致之意見，認爲在此時期，吾人仍應盡最大之努力，使政治協商會議之協議獲得成功，對於貴黨代表團聲明內容與事實不符之點，不願聲辯，現距政治協商會議所商定國民大會集會之期極爲迫近，弟等願盡最後之努力，切望先生等一本最大之責任心，將代表名單即日開示，俾國民大會得以如期開成，吾則會期因而延誤，責任將有所歸也，專此布復，即頌大安。</p>

<h3>陳逆璧君終身監禁　褚逆民誼處死刑　蘇州高等法院昨下午宣判</h3>
<p>〔本報特派記者蘇州廿二日電〕廿二日下午三時，蘇高院宣判褚逆民誼漢奸一案，審判長孫鴻霖，首席推事石美瑜，推事陸家瑞，檢察官韋維淸，署記官朱嗚球升座後，即提褚逆到庭，由審判長訊問姓名後，即起立以極嚴肅之聲調，宣讀判決主文曰：一褚民誼通謀敵國，圖謀反抗本國，處死刑，，褫奪公權終身，其所有財產，除酌留家屬必需生活費外，沒收」。審判長旋將判決理由朗誦一過，褚逆聞判，面無人色，雙唇顫慄，略有痙孿情狀。彼並一再欲宣布其被判決死刑之感想。爲庭上制止。三時零四分，褚逆退下，庭上再傳陳逆璧君到庭，仍由孫審判長宣讀主文，除陳逆處無期徒刑外，主文文字與褚案全同。陳逆雖於受審時極見强項，至此時乃不禁淚承於睫，頻頻以手巾擦拭。庭上曾吿二犯，如不服判決，可於十日內聲請覆判，但即使被吿不欲要求覆判，高院依法亦應向最高法院聲請覆判也。褚逆聞判時，强作　定日：「我很滿意，我上次審判時即自謂就死，至今已符本志，而外而人希望嚴辦漢奸的，如今也可以滿意了。撿察官已達到他的目的，大概也滿意了」。庭上即巖予斥責，告以「本院判你死刑，並非依從你本人的要求，亦不根據興論，而是依據你的行爲」。褚逆猶曉曉不已，審判長遂怫然吿曰：「法院的時問，非被告所得隨便利用，有什麼不服的理由，可以用畫面提出」，褚逆始無語而退。陳述聞判後，密判長訊其「服不服」時，含淚答曰：「當然不服，不過上訴是不要上訴的」。審判長乃吿曰：「不是上訴，是聲請覆判，你旣表示不服就好孑，可以把理由寫來」。陳逆至是乃又漸復其强項舊態，答曰：「不必寫了，反正寫了也一樣，一個革命黨人死的機會本來就太多了」。語畢而退，時爲三時二十五分。（兩道判決書原文刋第二版）</p>
<p>下午一時起，蘇高法院內外均已擠滿旁聽者，而女子遠較男子爲多，頗出記者意外。二時三刻，高院發出提票，由蘇警長率法警三名，帶馬車一輛前往看守所，途旁觀者如堵，陳逆穿藍布旗袍，御茶晶眼鏡，黑鞋灰襪。褚逆穿栗殼色綢夾袍，熨燙極挺，黑色皮鞋，手持卷宗夾。二犯並肩步出看守所，至馬車旁時互相謙遜，結果由陳先登車，抵高院後，法警命褚入刑事第四候審室，陳入第五候審室稍息，各予白開水一杯，褚逆徵見踧踖不安，陳逆則面有悻色。昨法院秩序因楊書記長官指揮有方，較前進步不少，惟中央攝影塲則未來攝製電影。</p>
<p>褚逆予出院時，曾將其光用複寫紙繕就之「宣判後的感想」數份分送各記者，文末並親自用墨筆簽名，然文詞荒謬鄙陋，各記者多契然置之。</p>
<p>退庭後，記者因陳逆（公博之妻李　莊代陳撰寫之「聲請覆判書」中，曾提出新的事實，特謁高院孫院長（鴻霖），詢其是否需要再行傳證，孫院長答稱：依法在第三審時，不得再提出新的證據。又謂，聲請覆判之後，最高法院之可能的處置如次：（一）核准原判，並將本案呈司法行政部再核，經確定後，即定期執行。（二）發還原法院更審，（三）提至南京重審，記者因孫院長爲富年承辦沈鈞儒等「七君子」案之蘇高院首席檢察官，因語及舊事，孫院長不禁　顏曰：「當年他們不高興我，現在再看者，常時我能不能放他們呢」？</p>
<p>石美瑜庭長親自監督印刷褚，陳二逆之判決書，悉心校對，極爲審愼，並吿記者：彼於二三日內即將赴京，因彼兼任京軍事法庭庭長，南京有日戰犯二十五人，將待彼前往主持審判也。此次蘇高院審判三巨奸之判決書，均由石氏起草，夙夜辛勤，略見淸癯，然仍精神奕奕，談笑風生。彼謂：軍事法庭法官之制服，將爲戎服佩劍，與普通法官不同，彼於事變前本在上海，戰後乃至屯溪，故至今猶不能忘情於屯溪之佳釀也。</p>

<h3>褚逆民誼判決書</h3>
<p>江蘇高等法院刑事判決三十五年度特字第四〇八號</p>
<p>公訴人本院檢察官。</p>
<p>被吿褚民誼，男，年六十四歲，浙江吳興人，佳南濤鎭。</p>
<p>指定辯護人高溶，吳縣公設辯護人。</p>
<p>右被吿因漢奸案件，經本院檢查官起訴，本院判決如左：</p>
<p>主文　褚民誼通謀敵國，圖謀反抗本國，處死刑，褫奪公權終身。全部財產，除酌留家屬必須生活費外，沒收。</p>
<p>事實　褚民誼係汪逆兆銘至戚，原任中國國民黨中央執行委員及行政院秘書長，中日戰事發生後，避居上海。嗣於民國二十八年夏，在逆抵滬，與日宼秘密媾和，並召開僞國民黨六全大會，褚民誼即行參加，擔任僞中央黨部秘書長中央執行委員監察委員等職，隨同汪逆奔走於南京靑島之問，與偽「縱新」「臨時」兩政府曾商改組問題。迨獲協議，即於二十九年三月十日，成立偽國民政府於南京。汪逆任偽主席兼偽行政院院長，褚民誼則任僞行政院副院長兼僞外交部部長，並主持僞府還都事宜。又於同年五月間，以偽副使名義，偕同陳逆公博赴日答禮，旋與日宼締結中日基本關係條約，允許日宼在蒙疆華北駐兵，並在我國領海內屯駐艦隊，及實行經濟提携，同時發表中日滿共同宣言，承認滿洲國，以破壞我國領土之完整。翌年二月，調任僞駐日大使，聯絡軸心各國，承認僞政府。九月返國，仍任偽外交部部長。至三十二年僞政府對英美宣戰後，又與日宼締結中日同盟條約，並隨汪逆前往東京參加大東亞會議。迭以謬論爲摧毀英美及消滅中央政府之宣傳。三千四年七月，出任偽廣東省長，兼僞廣東省保安司令及僞廣州綏靖主任等職。未幾，日宼投降，即經軍事委員會調査統計局拘獲，解由中國陸軍總司令部轉送本院檢察官偵査起訴。</p>
<p>理由　本案被吿與汪逆兆銘共同組織僞國民政府，担任黨政各要職，並偕陳逆公博赴日答禮，在僞駐日大使任內，聯絡軸心各國承認偽政府，嗣又與汪逆東渡，參加大東亞會議，且在僞外交部長任內，與日宼締結中日基本關係條約，中日同盟條約，發表中日滿共同宣言，及對我英美盟邦宣戰，表示與日宼同生共死，最後復任僞廣東省長等職，已據自白不諱。核與其所撰「參加和運自述」，及共犯陳公博陳豐君在另案之供詞，悉相符合，並有査獲之偽國民政府任命狀，「大東亞會議共同聲明」，及在陳逆公博案內調取之「僞國民政府使節團赴日答禮記」「僞國民政府政綱之理論與實施」「中日締約與大東亞戰爭」「國內新聞貼報簿」等件，可資印證。其通敵謀叛之逆跡，極爲彰明，自應構成懲治漢奸條例第二條第一項第一款之罪。雖據辯稱：「偽政府和平抗日，與重慶武裝抗日，係分工合作，殊途同歸，其行使偽政權之地域，乃係取之於日寇之手，原冀搶救人民，保存元氣，且準備伺機反攻，以期策應，何能謂為叛國。至於日寇締結條約，發表宣言，及對英美宣　，均係由汪逆簽字，被吿未曾附署，目亦不負責任，且又在僞府還都時，努力與建工作，恢復繁榮，並經交涉收回英美各國租界，不爲無功。」等語，然査（一）被吿始終主張聯合日寇，摧毀中央政權，此觀於敵國電機唱片收錄被告「僞府還都二週年紀念」「九一八的回顧與新認識」之廣播，及僞宣傳部編印之「中日締約與大東亞戰爭」第二十一頁所載被吿濱詞，已極明顯。且被吿參與之偽中央政治會議決議案內，並有「重慶方面對內對外各種政令及條約協定契約等一概無效」之記載。嗣任僞駐日大使，又復勾結軸心，承認偽府，冀使我國民政府失其國際地位。更足見其處心積慮，與中央勢不兩立。茲猶謂爲分工合作，顯屬矛盾。至謂伺機與國軍策應一節，旣係徒託空言，已難置信。且縱使日寇在崩潰前而仍作最後掙扎之時，被吿及僞府人員果曾準備離脫覊絆，以示傾向中央，亦顯係見大勢已去，希冀苟全，何能爲其有利之證明。（二）當戰事初期，敵勢兇猛，我軍爲戰略關係，移轉陣地，並採取消耗戰術，藉以抵制日寇速戰速決之企圖。故在淪陷區，則仍分布隊伍，待機反攻，各級地方政府，亦皆留駐邊境，執行政令，原期收復失地，撫慰人民，絕無委棄不顧之意。乃日寇以陷區過廣，力難控制，遂利用被吿與在逆等組織僞府，供其驅策，致使國軍不能活動，中央政令不能推行，而日寇勢力得以日臻穩固，肆行搜括宰割，陷人民於水深火熟之中。推原禍始，僞府實尸其咎。所謂搶救人民，保存元氣，自屬欺人之談。（三）中日基本關係條約與中日同盟條約之訂立，中日滿共同宣言之發表，以及對英美宣戰，均係在被吿僞外交部長任內之事。即被吿亦目　事前參與謀議，所有條約宣言，係由汪逆交僞外交部辦理無異。則此項外交重要事件，被吿旣居於主管地位，自應負共同責任，奚得僅以汪逆一人簽字發表，遽執爲免責之理由，至其完成僞府還都任務，及交涉收回各國租界，均係憑藉日寇勢力，僭行中央職權。此種行爲，旣已構成犯罪，更何能藉以居功。綜上各種抗辯，無非飾詞避就，均不足採。按被吿本係國民黨黨員，且任中央要職，乃於敵軍深入，戰事緊急之時，竟不知協力同心，共挽危局，反而附和汪逆，背叛中央，破壞抗戰大計，幾致國本爲之動搖，實屬甘冒不韙，罪無可逭。爰處極刑以肅紀綱。全部財產，除酌留家屬必須生活費外，併予沒收。據上論結，應依特種刑事案件訴訟條例第一條，刑事訴訟法第二百九十一條前段，懲治漢奸條例第一條，第二條第一項第一款，第八條第一項，第九條，黨員犯罪加重處刑暫行法第一條，刑法第二條第一項前段，第二十八條，第六十四第一項，第六十五條第一項，第五十七條，第三十七條第一項，判決如主文。本案經本院檢察官韓燾蒞庭執行職務。中華民國三十五年四月二十二日江蘇高等法院刑事第一庭，審判長推事孫鴻霖。推事石美瑜。陸家瑞。</p>
<h3>陳逆璧君判決書</h3>
<p>江蘇高等法院刑事判決，三十五年度特字第四一〇號，公訴人本院檢察官。被吿陳璧君，女，年五十六歲，廣東新會縣人，住廣州法政路三十號。公設辯護人高溶，吳縣公設辯護人。右被告因漢奸案件，經本院檢察官起訴，本院判決如左：</p>
<p>主文　陳璧君通謀敵國，圖謀反抗本國，處無期徒刑，褫奪公權終身。全部財產，除酌留家屬必須生活費外，沒收。</p>
<p>事實　陳璧君係汪逆兆銘之妻，原任中國國民黨中央監察委員。中日戰事發生後，汪逆受敵酋近衛文磨之利用，密與媾和，陳壁君參與謀議，旋即隨同任逆，自重慶潛往越南河內，由在逆發表主和艷電，嗣又轉赴上海，與日寇商訂和平基礎方案，於二十九年三月三十日，組織僞國民政府於南京，汪逆自任偽主席，陳璧君則任偽中央黨部監察委員，及偽中央政治委員會委員，並指導西南各省僞黨政軍事宜，同時與其胞弟偽廣東省長陳耀祖，在日寇矢崎酒井等指揮之下，處理粵政。直至日本投降，始行卸職。經軍事委員會調査統計局拘獲，轉解本院檢察官偵査起訴</p>
<p>理由　本案被吿對於其夫汪逆兆銘與日寇秘密媾和，曾經參與謀議，迨為國民政府成立後，並担任黨政要職，兼指導西南各省僞黨政軍事宜等情，已在本院及偵査中，供認不諱。核與陳公博褚民誼諸逆在另案之陳述均相符合。並有獲案汪逆簽發之特派狀，及敵軍特務機關與僞廣東省政府發給之身分證爲憑。而其在粵，仰承日寇矢崎酒井等意旨，與陳逆耀祖處理省政之事實，亦有陳逆耀祖以「崖」「華」暗號向被吿報吿及請示之電報，可資證明。是其通謀敵國，圖謀反抗本國，已屬衆證確鑿，毫無疑義。雖據辯稱：汪逆初本贊同抗戰，嗣以認爲和平時機已至，仍本救國救民之素志，而毅然主和，迨經建議中央無效，始行離渝，與日寇節次商討，方得另立政權，策動全面和平，其任務較之抗戰，尤爲複雜艱鉅，實與中央策略，並行而不悖。且當時陷區人民，痛苦至深，中央已無力維護，被告與汪逆不忍坐視，出而組織僞府，予以拯救，何能謂爲通敵叛國，等語。然査在逆於抗戰初期，因見國軍受挫，意志遽爲動搖，竟不得中央同意，擅與日酋言和。更不惜低首虜廷，接受辱國喪權之條件，而又甘受日寇支持，組織僞府，形成與中央對峙之局。其影響於人民心理國際觀聽者，至深且鉅。而其偽中央政治會議二十九年三月二十二日之決議案，除宣吿重慶方面，對內對外之政令條約等，一槪無效外，並號召所有軍隊，停戰待命，公務員來京報到。此有陳公博案內「國民政府政綱之理論與實施」一書之記載可稽。其目的在阻授抗戰，顚覆政府，更屬灼然可見。被吿對在逆此種悖謬舉動，匪特不加勸阻，反而從中贊助，使其執迷不悟，一意孤行，寗忍犧牲大節，斷送國權，以壓其領袖之慾。今猶謂汪逆主和，目的亦在救國，與中央抗戰國策無礙，顯係自欺欺人。復査中央關懷陷區人民，本有留駐之各級地方政府，於軍隊策應之下，相機推行政令，從事救護工作，以紓困厄。倘汪逆等不受日寇利用，實施淸鄕封鎖，多方阻撓，則民困庶可賴以稍蘇。不圖僞政府爲虎作倀，於日寇統制資源，搜括財物，無不予以便利，馴至民生凋敝，甚於倒懸。所稱組織僞府之目的，係在援救陷區人民，殊難自圓其說。核其所爲，應構成懲治漢奸條例第二條第一項第一款之罪。但按被吿與汪逆爲夫妻關係，因附和其主張，致罹法網，與普通情形，究有不同。而起訴香所載，被吿主持西南僞特工一節，質之被吿，復矢口否認，獲案僞特工廖公劭等之報吿，又係註明呈遞偽中央執行委員，與被吿所任偽監察委員之職銜不符，尙不能證明被吿有參與西南僞特工之事。爰於法定刑範國內，量爲科處。全部財產，除酌留家屬必須生活費外，應予沒收。</p>
<p>據上論結，應依特種刑事案件訴訟條例第一條，刑事訴訟法第二百九十一條前段，懲治漢奸條例第一條第二條第一項第一款第八條第一項第九條，黨員犯罪加重處刑暫行法第一條，刑法第二條第一項前段第廿八條第六十四條第一項第六十五條第一項第五十七條，第卅七條第一項，判決如主文。</p>

<p>社論</p>
<h3>中法關係的新展望</h3>
<p>這幾天來，法參謀總長余安將軍率領法國訪華團，及法大使梅里靄夫婦等，正自陪都飛抵北平，小作勾留，即將南來京滬。在重慶的時候，余安將軍還以訪華特使名義，代表法總統顧盎以法國橡葉戰功勳章，贈與蔣主席。在國內外的情勢日趨嚴重的今日，我們不可忽略了這種種企圖加强中法關係的活動。本來，自梅里靄大使到任，中法新的簽訂以來，中法兩國的關係即建築在一個新的基石，而這個基石就是以平等信愛爲特微。所有過去不快的陰影，均隨新的的簽訂而俱逝；而就在這個時候，在中法新的簽訂了以後，法國政府還特派像余安將軍這一種人物來華訪問，我們對於法國政府企圖增進中法關係的努力，實有充分的了解。</p>
<p>中法兩國在這次反軸心反侵略的戰事中所受的創傷，同樣重大，也同樣深痛。中國抗拒暴日歷時最久，其問廣大區械曾爲敵人所佔領，賴我蔣主席的英明領導，終見敵寇屈膝投降。此與法國一班志士，不甘敵偽統治，或在戴高樂將軍的旗下，在海外積極參加反軸心的戰事，或在國內，爲維護並宣揚法國的民族正氣，大舉展開反納粹的工作。在第二次世界大戰中，中法兩國實已各盡其最大的努力，博得光榮的地位。中法兩國過去的友誼，向稱親密，其問雖不無不甚愉快的事件，如不久的白爾丁號事件那樣，但由於法方對於事件的解決具有誠意，以及我國政府及人民一本忠恕的傳統精神，下欲事態擴大，卒能迅速和好解決。中國對東南亞無領土的野心，此早經我蔣主席宣吿中外。過去因爲盟軍作戰的關係，日敵投降，越南北部一帶由我國派軍前往，辦理日敵繳械接管等事，此番中法新的的簽訂，我方即以越北移交法軍接防，足見我國對越南絕無政治野心。凡此種種，俱足爲中法傳統友誼的表現。</p>
<p>今日世界第二次大戰雖已終了，然而老實說，國際形勢似乎仍須我們共同努力，方可保持世界和平。人類還不曾從戰爭的苦難中覺悟解脫出來，仍舊有人妄想以覇術統治天下。在這戰後的世界中，中法兩國所處的地位是相同的。試看從芬蘭，波蘭，羅馬尼亞一直到地中海，這昔日爲納粹附庸的東歐，如今不也自成爲一個壁壘麼？德意是戰敗了，整個歐洲大陸除了蘇聯泱泱大國而外，不是只剩下法蘭西還做着西方文明及民主的堅强堡壘麼？法蘭西在今日的歐陸，因此負有一種更重要的使命。如何不使整個歐洲仍爲一種權力政治所摧毀，這責任落在每個第四共和國人民的身上。任何法蘭西人都有繼續發揚光大法蘭西革命光榮傳統的義務。當集體主義橫流的今日，特別是法蘭西人，都有起而防衛「自由」「平等」「友愛」的使命。此在中國，其情形亦復相同。革命的三民主義有不少是受了法蘭西革命的影響。中法兩國立國的理想多少相同，在這戰後的世界更負有保衛「自由」，「平等」，「博愛」的同樣使命。在這種情形之下，中法兩國更需要密切携手，以維　世界的持久和平。</p>
<p>中法兩國的利益是相同的，在現在的動盪國際局勢中，中法兩國處於同樣的地位。創鉅痛深，所以也惟有中法兩國最需要安定的國際秩序以從事戰後的復興。我們之沒有領土野心，旣如上述，但是對於我們是兄弟之邦的越南，我們誼切手足，對於他們的福利自極關心。我們在此母庸指出中國與越南間過去的關係我們爲越南人民的將來，郤不得不有所呼籲。法國過去在越南所取的殖民政策，這實在爲法國的光榮，留下了極可遣憾的痕跡。我們祗要看一看東南亞共它殖民地的情况，便知法國在越南的統治如何不合理想。這次戰爭不是爲了維繫殖民帝國而起的，戰後的世界也並不是事事回復舊觀。越南人民的民族願望，法國應儘量使其實現。現在而談獨立，或爲情勢所不許；但無論如何，越南人民的自主願望，應儘可能予以滿足。此在法國本身亦是應該做的事。英國對印度尙且知道改變政策，何况愛好「自由」「平等」「博愛」的法蘭西人，當無對越南人民有所歧視之理。茲因余安將軍於訪華以後將訪越南，故對於越南的局勢，略述吾人之所感。</p>
<p>中國的立國最注重仁愛信義和平，對於余安將軍的來華訪問，我們謹表歡迎之忱。願余安將軍旅居平安，中法關係日趨親密！</p>

<h3>半載以來迄無建樹　日幣原內閣辭職　三黨協會組織聯合政府　日皇定今晨二次謁麥帥</h3>
<p>〔本報東京特派員廿二日專電〕據日皇室傳出可靠消息：日皇裕仁將於明晨十一時赴美大使館訪麥帥，此爲日皇第二次訪麥帥，第一次係在去年九月廿四日。聞日皇將與麥帥商討幣原內閣辭職後之局勢。按此次大選後，日報紙及政黨（進步黨除外）一致抨擊幣原，原因，幣原內閣之倒台，已屬必然之事。</p>
<p>〔聯合社東京廿二日電〕日幣原首相於今日下午五時三十分（東京時間）進宮，向日皇提出內閣總辭職。日皇裕仁已接受幣原內閣辭呈，惟依照慣例，在新閣未組成前，仍命幣原暫時留任。綜計幣原內閣成立六個月以來，以其未能解決糧食及其他各項民生問題，不斷施攻擊。此外對幣原同閣「一無建樹，」亦日漸表示不滿，此殆爲促成總辭職之主要原因。據消息靈通方面稱，日皇對新首相人選，將不過問，預料將由幣原以進步黨總裁之資格與自由黨領袖鳩山及社會黨領袖片山會同商定，惟須先經鳩山及片山之同意，多數人相信幣原或允出組聯合內閣，一般揣測自由黨將在新閣中佔四席進步黨及社會黨各佔三席，惟鳩山以有極端國家主義色彩嫌疑，仍在麥帥總部及日本政府偵察中，故衆信佔領軍當局不致許其出任日本領袖。</p>
<p>〔合衆社東京廿二日電」日本普選後未及兩週，幣原內閣已於今晚六時三十分正式宣佈辭職。內閣書記官長奈良橋亘向報界宣讀一聲明，內稱：內閣爲協助穩定政局，以謀解決國家當前之重要問題起見，業已辭職。該聲明中指出內閣在進行公正不倚之選舉方面，已完成其任務，內閣根據民意，尊重建立民主政府。至於未來在選舉後立即辭職之原因，乃由於當時局勢複雜，且並無一政黨在議會中獲得三分之一以上席次之故。</p>
<p>〔中央社東京廿二日專電〕一般推測幣原或將提名尾崎行雄為繼承人，但相信此八十八歲高齡之老政治家，在體力上恐不能勝任。在目前環境之下，任首相究竟爲誰，尙不重要，所重視者，必須實行某項措施，以保證最近選出之各政黨問能巡得穩定之合作行動。</p>

<h3>侵略戰中所奪財產　麥帥限令日具報　並不得有移動或轉讓情事　肅淸程序美人民表示擁護</h3>

<p>〔聯合社舊金山廿一日電〕舊金山紀事報今日社論稱，麥帥決定在日本自動進行其肅淸政治程序，對日管制委會蘇代表雖予反對，美國人民則將加以擁護。對日管制委會與麥帥之關係，有如內閣之與美國總統，麥帥所受爵位係聯合國最高統帥，以軍人而接受此責任及其所賦特種，係屬創舉。聯合國委員會乃一顧問團體，對於進行程序可向麥帥有所建議，自具價値，惟委員會或其任何代表，實無權可吿麥帥何者應做，何者不應做。麥帥能尊重此項關係，顯極公允，當可在日本繼續進行其健全堅定之政策云</p>

<h3>英工黨主席拉斯基談話　美新造原子彈　威力駭人聽聞　一枚即可毀滅美兩大州　美方認為無稽之談</h3>
<p>〔聯合社英國勃萊頓廿一日電〕英國工黨主席拉斯基敎授今日在會議席上談稱：美國新造之原十炸彈較之在日本所投者威力更大，一枚炸彈可毀滅美國印地安那及伊利諾斯兩大州，五枚炸彈可摧毀馬遜狄克松綫以南美國全部。拉斯基教授對於原十能之發展保守秘密政策，則加抨擊，稱爲「對於人類安寗之攻擊」。據稱：「余望吾人動員全部力量，以結束此項秘密政策之非法應用，此項政策，以毒害吾人每一國際關係之通路爲威脅。」又拉斯基今晚在家時，有人詢以關於原子彈智識之來源，渠拒絕作答，僅稱來自「美國人」，在最近一次訪美之時，得聞此項新炸彈。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿一日電〕此間原子彈專家對拉斯基敎授所發表之談話，咸表不悅。拉斯基敎授反對原子能發展保守秘密一層，雖與美國一部份科學家所主張者約略相似，但不能獲得官方多大同情。熟悉原子彈之人士對於拉斯基所述之原子彈破壞能力，均表訝異。就目下所知，依照一馬哈丹圖樣」造出之原子彈，與轟炸長崎所用者，式樣並無多大變動。一部份科學家估計，此項炸彈之效力，較之轟炸廣島者，增加效力約百分之二十五，官方已宣布此項炸彈成力與二萬噸炸藥相等。惟效能到達二萬倍之際，其實際破壞總效龍遠爲低落，或者與一百倍至三百倍者相等。依此推測，目前之實騐工作，與其製造轟炸距離廣大之巨彈，不如改進現有炸彈之效能爲愈。同時參議院原子能特別委員會委員哈特亦加批評稱：余深感拉斯基君對其所述之事，實際一無所知，即有所知，則余亦不能同意將此公開云。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦二十二日電〕美機以原子彈轟炸長崎時，在塲任官方觀察員之齊夏爾上尉今日發表談話，指拉斯基氏所發表關於原子彈之談話完全不確。賴氏曾謂美國現有成力極大之原子彈，每一枚爆炸後可破壞印第安那及伊列諾埃兩州之全部，或大於英格蘭。蘇格蘭。威爾斯全部面積之地區，齊上尉謂：在數年以內若無繼續之發明，則原子彈之破壞圈之半理，不過數哩而已。</p>

<h3>婦女界參加競選　眞是享權利盡義務的機會　朱素蕚說不是和男子們爭面子··希望多幾位代表替女子們說話</h3>
<p>— ·本報記者　邁天·</p>
<p>二十八日市參議員選舉，轉瞬就到？這幾天來，至少有幾百個候選人，把他們的公務，先躭擱一下。</p>
<p>忙着各方面的活動，在念於要踏上民主政治道上的中國，有這種現象，該是値得高興的。尤其是婦女參加競選，不但是婦女界要一致擁護，就是全國人民，如果記得國父遺敎中有「男女平權」的話，要眞正實現民主國家，都應該鼓勵女同胞們，開闢一條大道。</p>
<p>本市候選婦女，計有第五區上海市臨參會駐會委員朱素蕚，黃浦區市黨部婦運會幹事方英達，常熟區市黨部婦運會幹事凌其愼，田淑君，江寗區臨參會參議員陸惠民，向由職業代表謝能，張英榖，敎育界楊明暉等十餘人。</p>
<p>昨日下午記者特走訪婦運會最熱心份子之一的朱素蕚律師，朱女士前担任過第一次全國婦女代表大會上海代表，抗戰八年担任地下工作，現任婦運會委員，上海市婦女會常務理事，律師工會執行委員。她說：「女子要眞正達到男女平等地位，必須要經濟獨立，要打開眞正的職業門戶，否則高唱權利，禁止這樣，廢除那樣，都是徒然的。女子並不是情願墮落的，她們也是爲了生活呀！」「婦女要當參議員，」她繼續說：「不應當以私人立塲出發點，必須要做到爲大衆謀福利，眞能替全體女同胞服務。」她覺得目前的中國，不但是男子，即女子本身也很少能瞭解婦女地位的重要。所以她很希望這次參議會中能多產生幾位女參議員，目的不是在和男子們爭面子，而是希望以後多有機位代表來替女子們說話。</p>
<p>上海的參議員將有一百八十一位產生，按照全市三百三十餘萬人口計，女子佔一百五十餘萬，男子佔一百八十餘萬，差不多是二分之一的數目，如果一百八十一個人中有十分之一的女參議員，那也不算太多吧！女同胞們如果不願意再屈服於男子們掌下的話，這眞是一個享權利盡義務機會的大門，不衝是不能進去的啊！</p>

<h3>按照各地需要··台省施行糧政　運台商貸並不留難</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕頃據台灣省行政長官公署專門委員包可閎氏吿記者稱：最近各界對該署處理台省糧食工礦及貿易各方面行政，常多不明事實眞相之處，特爲分別解釋如次：台省糧食因農田已三年未下肥料，故產量銳减，糧食向吿缺乏。長官公署雖曾一度試辦糧食配給，終因各界反對而吿中　。目前情形，台南一帶要求配給，而台北則反對配給；故長官公署暫時即按照各地之需要，而施行糧政。未施行所謂</p>
<p>强迫配給制度。對台省工礦事業，長官公署接收時捨封條政策，而採監理辦法。故各重要工礦事業，仍能開工不懈，現已步入接管階段。原有日本技術人員，除麥帥特准遺留者外，大部份均將於四月底前遣送返國。現畏官公署駐滬通訊處，正趕派大批接管人員分批赴台，完成接管工作。貿易方面，各界常有統制之非議。據稱事實上任何商人，裝運任何貨物至台省，除海關所　禁者外，長官公署</p>
<p>決無留難之處。現所感到之唯一阻礙，厥爲船運噸位之限制。至台省唯一限制出口者，亦唯糧食一項，此所以防台省糧食愈趨嚴重化也。台糖之出口，則以交換肥料爲原則。蓋非如此則下兩年中生產台糖之肥料，即無法解決。至基隆之煤，則源源供政院燃料管理委員會統籌分配。其他如樟腦煙酒等物品，在台省向係專賣，所以涵保護貿易之意，別無所謂統制。又據告長官公署滬通訊處，自去年十一月以來，分批遣送赴台公務人員，已近三千人，現仍繼續遣送中。</p>

<h3>新姿初現的世界大城！　紐約初春漫步</h3>
<p>— 本報航訊　紐約特約記者朱家讓寄</p>
<p>這裏到三月廿一日，才算開始進入春季。儘管河邊的寒風，有時還來作祟，可是時候到底不同了，春天畢竟來了！太陽連日高照，把大地照耀得自光閃閃，中央公園的校頭綠　，也已生機　　，人們逐漸從　　熱的氛圍中投向大自然的懷抱。這座世界大城又是一番裝束了。</p>
<p>好像一闋迎春曲，紐約的萬國時花展在中央大厦開了幕，象徵春天果已到臨。據報紙記載，這個花展因戰事曾停開四年，今年捲土重來，再張旗鼓，故一般園藝人物，無不爭奇鬥姸。競以所栽精品出供衆玩。</p>
<p>要說這個洋洋大觀的展覧會是難以描述的，有一點却可提出：即他們此舉，不特搜羅宏富，五光十色，含有博覧意味，似猶着重園藝與實用途徑。展覽佔大樓三層，有的以庭園為背景，有的以居室傢具相裝點；有的大塲面，有的小擺飾，各安其所，各得其妙。這裏並吿訴你怎樣栽花，怎樣養花，一束紅玫瑰，從人家裝在紙匣內送上門來，你得怎樣處置，才能把它維持住一禮拜打十天美麗的生命，各種各色的鮮花，怎樣揷進不同口徑不同姿態的花瓶，弄得風儀綽約，笑語　人，都有人老究得頭頭有道。以我們這些衣食尙且不周的人看來，他們眞在幹着「錦上添花」的玩意了。</p>
<p>假如紐約是可代表美國的話，看紐約不啻看到了全美；事實上，他們的生活社會確有和我們不少異同的地方。他們固然藉着工業化，使一般生活水準高過人家若干倍，而他們的活力以及社會風尙，也實有其獨到之處。閒來偶步街頭，看看聽聽，再闔上眼去想想，縱不有「百感交集」之一套，却亦可一吐為快。</p>
<p>首先，我們不能否認美國是個資本主義的國家，到處顯見錢的權威，自不免資本主義的罪惡。可是有時想想，他們之有今日，她們也目有其社會的道理。所謂資本主義，原乃生根於自由競爭與私有制度之上。旣可私有，便要自由競爭，不競爭何以私有？而同時亦因大家可來競爭，故人人可得私有，這種憑恃己力公平取勝的原則，推進了西洋文明，打穩了富强基礎。這是好的一面。流弊方面照有些說法，勢致覇權出現，大多數人要沒有飯吃，可是在這裏幷不見這種現象。他們認爲這種幹法的弊害不致像某些宣傳家所說的糟。資本家固然財富要集中，但政府執行重稅政策可加節制，宗敎家敎育家紅十字會以及羣情輿論……常使有錢人慷解荷包，大批吐出來，興辦社會事業，甚至輸送海外去。再說大衆平民生活，雖有一大部分靠薪工，但一般收入比較豐厚，物價可以穩定得住。特別他們是以生產爲最高哲學的，只要生得多，產得快，物價會得降平，工資會得增高，目然生活會得更好的。美國社會的安定和繁榮，可說就在這種邏輯下發展着。</p>
<p>我們當不必就這種社會意議在此有所褒貶，僅從實際上看一件事可以注意的，即「物盡其用，人盡其才」八個大字，不想倒在這裏先兌現了。他們眞做到了「利用厚生」的理想，凡物無不盡其用，不但不使絲毫「貨棄於地」，且必竭其性能，高度利用，使宇宙萬物皆爲人用，一木一石俱不辜負其存在。另一方面，做一個人，就要確確實實的做個人，不可像物不像人。人生在世是用物的，不是使人的，人皆是人，也該各有人的尊嚴而不爲人用。據此推論，我們便可看到三個社會現象：第一，物資因此特別豐富，到處充斥，並且光怪陸離，日新月異，人類的享受急趨最高峯。第二，社會制度鼓勵鑽硏，獎進成功，人們競爭對象傾向寬大的自然，出頭機會較多，人人可以爲「才」。第三，由於生產力强，大家穿暖吃飽，最低生活皆有保障，背脊挺得起，向人低頭的機會减少，平等觀念加增，人格普遍提高，人人可做「人」的「才」。末了，因爲物盡其用，人人有物可用，無庸人用人，於是除了理髮匠，擦鞋匠一類工人比較尙不可省之外，其餘顯然在縮减。住家傭人不要說了，即市上餐樓酒館茶房侍役，也有時發生「人荒」，不少店舖的樹窗上，經常貼着招雇的字招。工業化社會的職業變遷，母寗是個正常現象，從直接役於人的方面，轉向到社會的平頭主義，豈不是提高人的品格的另一說明？</p>
<p>但重要關鍵，仍是一個。大家先把國家弄富了，人人都有飯吃，人人抬得起頭，人人才算得人。這裏要聲明，像他們這樣幹法，是否能做到理想的澈底的平等，一如社會主義所說，固猶不知；但顯然生產進一步令人類社會地位跨一大步，這個原則是共通的，也是無可懷疑的了。</p>
<p>賺錢第一　快活至上</p>
<p>依據上述社會結構，推演另一幅畫面，我想他們硬是「賺錢第一，快活至上」的。賺錢是安身立命之木，是獲取麵包之道。他們這資本主義的社會，一切索性都以錢來計算，所以錢是可以全權代表人間的幸福的。人要生活，人要奢侈，惟一要着只是錢，因此大家想賺錢，大家用盡方法想錢。而且工人的最低工資有規定，最高報酬無深淺，所以只要願意，几確具能耐，儘可盡你可能盡量賺錢。同時還有一點，物質享受在提高，也非得賺錢積極，才足與人類慾望時代潮流並駕齊驅。因此賺錢熱中，這氣息確勝一等。</p>
<p>打開報紙看，或坐在地下車內，到處是觸目的廣吿。廣吿的設計盡了廣吿學的能事，自不必說，主要原因不外想多做生意，多賺錢。幾家大公司雖然禮拜天依例休業，但禮拜六下午照常開門，而且每星期中必有二一天營業時間延長到夜晚九點鐘。其他普通商店，更漫無限制，尤其名爲藥房實即雜貨商店的Drugs，簡直要每天開到午夜，（飲食娛樂塲當不例外）沒有星期例假，跟我們普通商店一樣。這較之英國限制嚴格，每天非五點半打烊，星期六下午及星期天停業相去太遠。再說吧，美國人的生意經也眞會得做，走進隨便那家舖子，店員們一似都是熟讀售貨學，要你空手進去，買了出來，你原想買一件，結果非使你「心悅誠服」地買了二件三件不可。這固然是商意經的普遍現象，然他們賺錢的興趣，自較濃厚。</p>
<p>賺錢之後的問題，是用錢，這纔是所以賺錢的目的，而在美國人似很懂得的。所以一般而論，都是除了必要的節儲以外，盡量用錢，盡量求取生活滿足，再盡量講究享受尋樂，以調劑工作不虛一世。他們認爲這樣也可使錢的流通加快，社會繁榮增進，於是消費奢侈，和一般性的享樂便隨而發達了。尤其這座紐的城花花世界，無非消費塲所，任你怎樣有錢講吃講用，也塡不滿人的慾　。雪亮光潔的飲食店，到處人山人海，橘子水牛奶湧如泉水，魚肉米麵予取予求。一天從早到夜始終有人吃喝其間，沒有什麼「上市」「下市」。這裏的消費享受，就廣義講，除吃喝（最近因物價統制有些物品如牛油等生產短絀，不久爲救濟歐亞或將節减糧食）外，衣服因物價統制略感缺乏，一般工業生產日常用品以工潮更現不足，（如汽車無綫電電氣冰箱等）目下稍受抑制，但實際他們的尋樂領域，幷無减色。百老匯路的娛樂塲所每天座無隙地，買戲票排隊列雙行。洛克麥勒中心（Rockefeller　Center)座極大的戲院，叫做無綫電城音樂院（Radio　City　Muisc　Hall）除了電影還有歌舞，其建築偉大佈置富麗，殆可首屈一指，每天一早起，便有大隊男女恭候買票，全院座位約二萬，還要人家動輙一等半小時，才得進去。至於夜總會酒排舞榭，城開不夜，常更在意想之中了。</p>
<p>這裏還可一述的，他們以尋樂與工作相輔而行，藉尋樂以增進工作效率。所以一有餘閒，無不找些消遣，活動精神。美國人平日一切談吐競尙輕鬆幽默，以引人歡笑，說話要惹動人高興爲原則。我們中國習俗喜川客套，不免抑减情緒，反不凑趣，這也許亦是東西文化不同之點。然西洋人習尙奔放，處處要往快活高興的趨向走，而不顧小節，實在表現的很盡　。再舉個例：大學在我國觀念該是講學之所，所謂「巍巍學府」，那曉得這裏的除了上課之外，亦竟與大旅館一模一樣。飯廳·酒排·彈子房·應有盡有。哥倫比亞的男生宿舍樓下，夜夜樂聲悠揚，深宵跳舞，實使老學究聞而拍案；但哥倫比亞之爲哥倫比亞，並未損傷其絲毫令譽。</p>
<h3>生活覓取進步　浪費要求合理</h3>
<p>美國物炎多消耗大，在經濟家眼光看來，自然是十分浪費的。舉幾個例：紐約的自來水，自百里外山上接來得之該是不易，但供應無限制，一般用戶誰去節約。據他們自己統計，無人每日用水不啻一百餘介侖，全城日耗數字驚人。電力，同樣不値錢，到處光炬輝煌，爐火熊熊，普通人家誰沒有好幾件電氣用具，房東太太決不致跟你吵電費。又說這裏的用紙也够兇，紙杯紙巾到處撒滿，究整紙器一過手即成敝屣。像報紙主要者凡十家左右，發行量都很可觀。以紐約時報爲例，星期日銷數最近已經超出一百萬份，篇幅多至八十至一百頁，外加星期特刋書報週刋，你大略翻一翻，都得化上一小時，紙張消耗驚人可想知，其他不勝列舉。不要說以我們久侶節約運動的眼光看，他們太浪費，就是美國人白己也不免覺得有時太「暴殄天物」。特別在茲世界飢荒聲中，美國要本已飢已溺之懷節减消費，救濟人家，華盛頓多少政要以及社會名流自杜魯門總統以次，都已先後呼籲人民節减消費，接濟歐亞，善後救濟會議此項在大西洋城開會，前署長李門幷主美國恢復定量分配。美國人藉其得天獨厚享用，未免過量，自亦是事實。</p>
<p>不過，筆者在此，並不爲之辯護，我覺得他們雖然浪費，但也有其合理的原則。換句話說，他們在這一端浪費了，可在另一端節省了巨大無形的消耗。我有時仍想他們能善用物質，以所有物資爲我人用，那末旣經是個富人，何必還要吝嗇？有物不用，豈非傻子？所以亨用自然，母寗是合理的。無况消耗乃以增進人類生活健康文化爲目的，一個生產已經發達的國家，原不能再講節的以阻塞生產，反之正大可鼓勵消費，以共饗生產之果，提高生活水準。可是究其實際，他們又何嘗不講合理化呢？你看看大建築裏電梯如穿梭，男女司機不下百數，這可說人力的浪費，可是爲萬千人乘電梯的設想，這些司機正替他們節省了無數時間與精力。公共塲所洗盥不用可以經洗的毛巾，而把紙帕大量消耗，豈不有些無謂；然正爲此而防杜了傳染疾病，節約了難以計數的大衆體力和金錢的消耗。再講喝水吧，說句笑話，這口洋水倒眞好喝。自來水便是十足安全的飲料反正洗臉水飲料水一樣東西。這裏各大公司都裝有飲冰器，你想嘗試只把小鍵一扭，噴泉便潺潺而出，淸凉可口，並不要你分文。自然這種給水工程。是艱鉅的，但從此開水決不必燒了，而衛生則有保障，節省煤薪金錢，又不知凡幾？此外再舉一例：這裏的交通工具，除了尙有少數公共汽車，雇有售票員外，（實際僅收錢無粟掣）其餘都已廢除。乘客上車自動投錢，投了錢並無票給，不投也惟有亦自己知道。可是也許他們的程度到步，這樣省人省紙，效果倒仍蠻好。紐的的地下車亦向不賣票，乘客只是把五分鎳幣丟進栅門，轉身入站，以故賣票售票都不設置，每天省下的車票用紙，更是何等驚人。這樣一看，他們表面在浪費實在還處處講究節省。浪費之中仍要合理化，不必要與不合理的浪費，他們還是不幹的。</p>

<h3>謝謝你原諒我　諧和人問關係</h3>
<p>在態度舉止上，有人露爲美國人比較活潑，而莊重略嫌不足。聳肩架，舞手勢，一邊說話，一邊表情，眉眼面部往往一齊動作，多數人殆由習慣成了自然。可是大體上說，他們還是十分注重禮貌和秩序的，一天二十四小時，除非你獨個子關在房裏不跟人家接觸，吾則總得接收或發送不知其數的「謝謝你」「原諒我」「對不起」……走在路上輕輕碰到人家，必然來個「對不起」，讓你先走了說聲「謝謝你」。上餐館茶房端菜給你，原是他的義務，可是吃客還得道句「謝謝你」。買東西店夥收錢，照例致謝，甚至敎室中先生問詢學生之後，也來「謝謝你」。此外，應謝之多，遂可想知。說「原諒我」的塲塲會同樣多：向人問路不可無「請原諒我」以開端，否則多少有些魯莽。聽不淸人家的話而請再說一遍，並不報之以What?或由喉嚨裏冒出個重濁的「哼？」音，却必又是道地的Pardan。總之有請於人，例先致歉，人家對你有了便利，不管是否實惠或數量多少，也不問他對我服務出於熱誠或本其責任，一槪表示謝忱。於是「謝謝你」和「原諒我」……成了每一個人的口頭禪，是每一節談吐的「開塲白」和「壓軸戲」。自然這些口語以我們中國人看來，有時實嫌多餘而過分，而且一般人口中鬧忙，是否言出由衷，究竟有多少價値，亦是疑問；不過平心說，我們也似乎不庸太抽絲剝繭，這些習慣足以融和應對，潤澤人類接觸，確不止「說話的藝術」而已。</p>
<p>而况這幾句口頭禪，如加思索也是很有道理的。一個人常存感謝人之心，知道人家惠我實多，益念我自己負人之鉅，而作「克已」表現，社會上人與人關係會由此種觀念造成諧和的。說到此地，不由聯想起我們的孔老夫子也早有他的「忠恕之道」。忠者「盡己」，恕者「推己」，似乎與「謝謝你」和「原諒我」有些出入，其實是很符合。惟其恐未「盡已」，處處誠惶誠恐的要人原諒，「推己」不足，予以狂熱的謝意。足見東西文化道理僅有一個，縱有小異，還是大同。不過這裏有一點風尙也許亦關民族性，中外習性究不一致。東方人，尤其我們中國人的性格興趣，傾向潛在，凡事總喜先抑後揚，藏躱三分，不善表現，而西洋人則逈異。他們有七分能力總得表現十分，待人接物，雖然亦講詞藻婉轉，但不用過分客氣，以免抑煞風景，不易親密。以此初履異土的國人，與外人交際，往往不能盡得其當。舉幾個小例：有人當面稱贊你英語說得不差，我們通常會脫口否認「啊不，我的英語太壞」。有時你在社交場中，跟美國人初次跳舞，照多數習例，開首每先聲明「對不起我是跳不來的」。那知這些話，我們視爲很應當很禮貌，而他們却每認爲奇特。再如他們以爲悅耳賞心，却因我們認爲不自然，以致躊躇不言不作的，例如請人吃飯，不表揚自己飯菜講究；受人餽贈，不當塲打開以表示你的欣賞和滿意。再有如在適當塲合，不適時而公開的贊頌女客美麗，這些往往會使人家失望。可是這些我們中國人絕不習慣，因爲成見已深，照一般解釋，這些話豈不有意尋人開心嗎？</p>
<p>精神生活　仍不偏廢</p>
<p>美國的物質生活總算登峯造極了，尤其這座世界第一大城，紙醉金迷，全球獨步，七百多萬居民耳濡目染，聲色的誘惑，物質的追求，其狂烈程度自不消說。可是在這種金錢萬能物質昌盛的環境下，奇怪，他們仍然注重精神生活，他們仍然追求宗敎安慰、。物質滿足了，並不忘記精神，雖有物質生活，還不輕視精神生活，而這點對於他們國家和社會的維　發展，殊有密切關係。</p>
<p>這個國家的宗敎除了天主敎，就是基督敎。雖然兩者有些不同，而新舊約聖經都這一本。所以大致說，他們的信仰還是一樣的。我說這裏的宗敎空氣濃厚，第一，你可看到敎堂之多，恐除羅馬以外就沒有比得上它，其建築宏偉也是不易多觀。敎堂分佈的非常普遍，無論喧鬧到華爾街或第五大馬路，到處巍然卓立，有的建築色澤尙新，有的則已全部焦黑。第二，敎友人數衆多，禮拜天到處客滿。不少禮拜堂舉行早晚禮拜二次，像聖彼得大敎堂往往分班禮拜，一批進去，一批出來，忙得不了。所有禮拜堂平日全日開門，以便行人入內祈禱，有幾處則每天舉行晨晚禮拜，不講道，只是唱詩祈禱，男女敎友亦是擁擠不堪。還有，社會的宗敎空氣，如電台廣播，報刋紀載，以及名流政要演詞文吿，總得多多少少帶些宗敎意味，種種色色，表徵美國人是有宗敎信仰的，是敬畏上帝的。</p>
<p>但是要間這些敎宗，究竟有什麽强固的組織嗎？問了多少人，都說很自由很散漫。除了天主敎以外，基督敎不隸屬羅馬敎皇，更根本不與聯邦政府有什麽關係。據敎會年鑑一九四五年統計基督敎堂金國共有二五三，七六二座，敎友七二，四九二，六六九人。（一九三六年僅十九萬座敎堂，五千萬敎友）。但天主敎徒恐猶不止此數。這些人固然平時未必人人虔誠，但多半納捐奉獻，照盡義務。這裏敎堂經費分經常費及海外差會經費，每年數字不小，俱由敎友分別簽認負擔。故有些大敎堂財政儘管充足收師年領巨薪。多數敎堂組有中國傳道機構，經常派人在華傳道，他們工作的地區以及經費分配，在中國另作規劃。</p>
<p>現在我們再要問，他們這樣的宗敎信仰，到底對於他們的世道人心起了什麼作用呢？這問題當然不易答復，因爲這究竟是抽象的。尤其像紐的這種大都市，社會罪惡多。實未易看出顯著的消極作用；但是據多數敎會中人以及公正人士論評，這個國家如果沒有宗敎信仰，那更要人慾橫流，現在就本有這此惟一的社會敎育與訓練機關，每禮拜給人打氣，給人磨光刮垢，高舉道德火炬，作中流砥柱，這個國家的道德水準，就是　樣在積極的維繫着。譬如以社會風氣說，儘管男女關係隨使，却還有敎會掌握的輿論監督，一個人如想做些事業，而有道德缺憾，這是非常棘手的。美國有個全國性的敎會團體，常常發表言論，批評政治社會。不久以前開過大會，連原子彈轟炸廣島也加批評。事實上這枝宗敎力量確還是這個國家這德力的中堅。他們平日本其宗敎信仰，以完全民主與自由的方式發言，領導羣倫，影饗人心，直接左右國家的政策，因亦重大。當此世亂紛紛，美國旣以其精壯物力戰勝了敵人，茲猶欲悲天憫人挽救饑饉，力樹正義，這種偉大的道德力，我們不能否認他們是主要得力於宗敎。</p>
<h3>低頭遙想祖國　依然救死不遑</h3>
<p>現在，看看人家，便不由得想想自己了。這個國家建立不過一百七十年，己進步得這般田地，人民豐衣足食，眞所謂民生樂利；而回首祖國，多數同胞竟還在嚼草根度日，這個對照怎敢叫人正視？我們有久遠的歷史文化人家是欽佩我們的，這回長期抗戰獲得勝利，國家地位躍登五強，面子當然很有；然而我們如果不是盲目自傲！而有些良知良感的話，身處國外，實在有時令人侷促不安，甚至抬不起頭來。</p>
<p>這裏報紙對於我國的消息是紀載十分詳盡的。尤其煎慶上海長春等地電訊，莫不長篇累牘。但說來說去，印象只有一個，即是統一尙有障碍，國運猶待穩定。蘇聯盟邦在東北不肯撒兵，這裏的與論都抱不平，可是自己國家還不强盛內部還有問題，這是最無可掩飾的事實。特別像若干時以前，華盛頓以及一部輿論，都說過，中國若不統一將無以分担世界和平的責任，若五强的頭銜亦有影響所的。顯然國家尙未脫離困難，使每一個國民減少光彩，尤其旅居外國，一般反射的光度特別强，想想自已的政府還在艱難的環境中，艱苦應付，戰後大局，尙沒有踏上康莊的大道。經濟恐慌絲毫不比戰時輕鬆，且因物價繼續在躣漲，人民絕沒受到勝利的實惠。平民生活苦了又苦，中原糧荒尤其慘烈，這個老鄉如何不想？却又怎忍想得？</p>
<p>事實很顯明，我們本身的進步，還遠跟不上這幾年來在國際上的成就，名雖歸而實朱至，內容與聲譽猶不配合。到外邊來看看，國家比我們小的太多，可是講建設，講人民生活，我們徒掛虛名，實在及不到人家。別人都有工業品，我們僅是農產品，像瑞士這種蕞爾小邦，小國人民鑽在小圈子裏硏造小機器，如今鐘錶樂器打字機馳名寰宇。北歐斯坎地那維三國，論國際地位那趕得上我國，但是丹麥瑞典人今日吃用不少，歌聲滿街。我們呢？雖然廣衆土民，新膺五强榮銜，不是減自己威風的話，可眞不免洩氣、外國人心目中誰不把大多數中國人當作窮小子，可憐的人類？你如走進藥房，店夥們會很靈敏的招徠你買維他命，有一次筆者給他惹得有些惱，問他原因，他倒是一副同情的面孔說，中國很多人現在沒飯吃，所以這東西他們需要，我當時想爭爭面子立刻回答他中國出米出麥，飯多得很，可是一思這種打腫臉充胖子有甚意思，中國的窮有目共見，靠這樣掩飾是太蠢的。何况，電影上的畫面，書刋中的圖片，從印度看到這裏儿有關中國題村，能有幾起是悅目可觀的。沿路旅行每有點綴各地特徵的照片展覽，代表中國的不是「文王神課」，便是衣衫襤褸的窮苦老太婆或小脚女人。美國現在一面解役，一面仍在募兵，要募兵得用種種廣吿方法以吸引壯丁，前天在報紙上登出一幅廣吿，居然亦承蒙不棄，以四川的滑桿作了題材，幾個盟軍各坐滑桿，由中國滑桿夫氣喘汗流的連貫前進，說是亨受世界旅行。同時即在這裏自己出版的有些書刋，也有這種情形，最近看到有一期雜誌，以水牛耕田來象徵中國。這種落後的事實，儘管不假，却不懂何必還加强調，國家的美麗的鏡頭究還不少，自己的弱點少暴露些，豈不更好？</p>
<p>最後一點：我們現在旅居此地的人數不算少，人人頂着人家的天，踏着人家的地，穿着人家的衣，吃着八家的飯，但是一想自已終是中國人全部靠了人家的文明，略偷得一日之安。再看自己的身上，那樣是由祖國帶得來，眞不由你不慚愧萬分。當然，我們雖然沒有工業品，不是沒有好東西，可是河山依舊「破碎」，人民尙在水深火熱中。在善後救濟的大門，我們還正是一羣可憐的嗷嗷待哺之一部分。人家在「錦上添花」，我們依然「救死不遑」，我們在人家面前有什麼拿得出表現？甚至講一件小事，有些喜歡集郵的人，往往跟中國人討郵票，當很平常的，殊不知我們的郵票數字太驚人，爲免是非，有人竟縮回了手。舉此一例，可槪其餘。總而言之，我們是差，差，差，太差。我們無論如何得俯首承認，痛自檢討。外國的月亮與中國的月亮當然是同樣的；但若一邊是庭臺樓閣，而另一邊老是斷垣殘壁，反映月色自有不同。我們現有難關不打緊，問題祗在全國上下，在此千載一時，能否不失機會，把乾坤旋轉過來？這擔子是每一個人有份的。發牢騷不是辦法，而要大家拿出良心，切切實實地負起責任來。（黃花崗烈士紀念日於紐約）</p>

<p>〔本市訊〕敎育部國民敎育司司長顧樹森氏，爲各地書荒問題，近曾數度來滬，尋取解決辦法，緣收復區因紙荒及交通困難，與僞課本充斥等原因，醞釀而成之敎科書荒問題，迭經各方呼籲，已引起敎育部之嚴切注意，除迭令各地敎育行政機關嚴厲禁燬僞課本，並予販賣採用者以相當處分外，日前顧司長特再度來滬，調査國定本印製及供應情形，並會同各書商轉向敵僞產業處理局商洽，決定將各倉庫中封存之敵僞報紙，悉數由國定本供應處價購，作為敎科書印製之用。近日各家已在籌款購領，以便趕印，惟封存敵紙數量，所餘己甚微少，其中可供印製書籍之用者，總數尙不及四萬令。顧氏返京後，仍定日內再行來滬，指導各家另再設法增購，並帮助解決各項技術上困難問題，如調査各省市學生人數，及需書數量，酌量採用合作社辦法，及陸運水運噸位時間等問題，預計今年秋季各地學校用書，情形必能改善云。</p>
<h3>尊師運動</h3>
<p>全面展開差著成績</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市各界在市敎育局領導之下，全面展開尊師運動，差普成績，茲向各方探誌於下</p>
<p>學校方面</p>
<p>本市學校當局，多責成學生向家長勸募尊師獻金。家長方面，藉口繳納二次學費，已不勝再行負担者，固不乏人，惟覺尊師第一，踴躍獻金，義不容辭者，則居十之七八。以故學校籌募尊師獻金，成績尙稱不惡。</p>
<p>委員方面</p>
<p>尊師運動，委員會加聘幹事，連日張貼標語，推進尊師運動，不還餘力。惟委員方面，對於如何獻金，手續多朱明瞭，通常募捐有捐册，此次以無捐册，尙多觀望。惟有一部分委員已自動捐助，將捐款逕交指定銀行核收。又委員殷獨鶴於日前假上海電台，廣播「尊師的意義」，略謂：尊師運動，是大家的責任，爲我們第二代着想，應富義不容辭，踴躍捐輸，有錢出錢，作物質上的幫助。各位可少看一塲戲，少吸幾包烟，少喝幾杯酒，節省無謂糜費，而作有益之義舉，又何樂不爲云云，聽者頗爲感動。該會總幹事李熙謀氏，亦假上海電台，定今日下午八時，播講，題爲「上海敎育之展望」。</p>
<p>社會方面</p>
<p>名平劇家梅蘭芳周信芳等曾爲尊師運動，籌演義劇。並聞梅蘭芳，周信芳等之平劇，及管夫人，郞毓秀等之歌唱，先在上海均將電台播送。名書畫家馬公愚，鄭午昌等，亦邀集海上書畫名家，籌備尊師書畫義展。又書家譚雲珊，爲響應尊師運動，即日起，託王星記箋扇莊，提潤資五成，充作尊師獻金。至於商界方面，兒童書局自動舉行「尊師運動週」，以營業收入提成獻金。王開照相館，亦自動捐款三十萬元，爲各界倡。</p>
<h3>糾正過往學風</h3>
<p>復且章校長昨對學生訓話</p>
<p>〔大公社訊〕國立復旦大學，校長章益，因敎授停敎，昨日上午，召集全校學生訓話，糾正過往學風，幷勉勵全體同學，切實爭取學識，並謂該校校舍，尙嫌缺少，課室不多，將來由重慶來歸之同學，必發生上課之困難，故目前正向有關當局，請求撥給敵日留下之房屋，以資解決未來困難云。美國學童的保健衛生</p>
<p>圖示一看護在一所美國義務公學內測驗三個女生的目力，以便決定配用眼鏡與否。這不過是許多保健法中的一種。校方的醫師看護，在每一幼稚生學齡開始初期，便試行檢査。每年若干次，還有牙醫替他或她們檢査牙齒。一個孩子一有疾病，校方馬上會召請父母來討論診治辦法。學校裏並無診治牙病的地方，但孩子們可以免費向牙醫院就診。一般疾病的及早診治，可以阻止年長時的嚴重病况。低級學級中，便開始有規則的體操和競賽。從十二歲到十八歲的學生，便從事較劇烈的練習，同時還授以個人的保健衛生</p>
<h3>出路解決</h3>
<p>平臨大補習生　分發國立大學</p>

<h3>美國敎育之十大動態</h3>
<p>— 蔣建白</p>
<p>最近十餘年來，美國的敎育行政與學校本身，都起了不少新的轉變與新的適應。在敎育的理論上，以實騐主義的發展，對學校的內容，加上了很多的修正。民主主義爲敎育的基本目標，近十年來，各種學說，使此民主主義感受到很大的威脅，經過了很多的磨鍊，一方加强了他的責任，一方也說明了他應有的重點。美國人士認爲民主主義是自由平等之民體的基石，民生的方式，政府的形態，他有適應性，在動態的和進步的過程中發展着。因此敎育是動態的適應，與民主主義，相助相成。</p>
<p>由於環境的需要而起的適應，由於敎育界領袖的硏究探討，意見的交換，由於敎員之流動性，散佈實施，由於新交通工具—報章，電影，無綫電—的傳播民間，故若干意見主張，能够調和折中，漸趨一致。作者就十餘年來美國敎育上的進展，在今後十年二十年將爲發展之中心問題，歸爲十大動態，述其槪略：</p>
<p>（一）地方行政之缺陷，與中央權責之發展：美國敎育向重地方自由發展，全美十一萬一千五百個敎育行政單位，雖各有其共同之點，然亦有顯著之差異。各州多僅爲法律上之主管，而聯邦政府在憲法上則無敎育事項之規定。是以地方單位發展之結果，若干地方不免發生許多流弊。（一）黨派勢力之操縱，（二）土劣之干涉，（三）單位過小不能單獨發展，（四）地方領袖人之之不足（五）經濟力量之簿弱，（六）靑年訓練與救濟之困難，（七）義務敎育之不能均衡普及，（八）敎育水準低减，缺乏全國適應性，都是其顯著之處。是以在羅斯福總統時代乃有靑年訓練救濟的組織，民衆濟助營，敎師工作行政等，均爲聯邦政府所主持。在戰時更有若干敎育行政，直接由聯邦辦理，聯邦政府之參加主持敎育事項，原爲救濟需要及地方之未能辦理者，但久之逐漸成爲事例。此種事實，引起全國敎育界之嚴重爭奪，一方而承認地方單位有若干事實上的缺點，而應有統籌救助之必要，一方面要保存地方之自由發展，面不願聯邦之統制敎育。若干教育學者，有一種折中的主張，認爲聯邦應居鼓勵領導地位，並盡量予以經費補助，所有應辦事業，應通過行政由地方主持之，換言之，即聯邦補助經費而不加統制，但某種特殊事項，亦可由中央酌辦，將來並可成立一聯邦敎育署，由國會通過此案，直隸國會，爲一領導硏究，調整聯繫之機構。由於上列的事實與意見，將來的敎育行政，一面仍保持地方的相當自由，一面中央權責亦將有更進一步的發展。一面不能爲中央集權，一面亦將不能全爲地方分權，此爲今後之趨勢。</p>
<p>（二）敎育的社會政策與民權的發動：敎育學者認定敎育是一個社會政策，不是一個超然獨立的東西。社會政策所抱定的目的與其所運用的方法，應該是一致的，相助相成的。什麼目的必須用什麽方法，而什麽方法，方可達到眞正的目的。美國的社會政策，是民主主義的社會主義，所以教育的社會政策，便是發展民主主義—自由平等的生活之道。目的旣在達成民主主義，方法亦必須民主，亦即唯有民主主義的方法，才可達到民主主義的目標。敎育行政的主旨，要提倡發展這種社會政策的目標和方法，因此必須要敎育靑年，訓練民衆，發揮民主的民權，使成為權力之泉源與權力之基層。此項基層的發動，在敎育的力量，而敎育的功能擴大，又要靠此民衆的基層。美國敎育界深深的感覺到各地方功利團體和個人，壓力重重，使敎育的進展和受敎者的福利，發生許冬的障礙。唯一解除的方法，便是訴諸人民，運用民權，發揮民力，因爲敎育是人民的，受人民的委託而辦理的敎育行政，在敎育人民輔助敎育的設施，才是民主的精神，此已成爲敎育界有知之士大聲急呼的共同趨向。</p>
<p>（三）實施均衡計劃加速機會均等：美國推行義務敎育若干年，在量與質的兩方面，當然有顯著的進步，但就調査統計所得，依照美國的文盲標準，能讀不能寫，及不能讀不能寫的人數，仍佔百分之七八，程度方面，高低的差異甚大，其基本原因，則由於經濟能力的差異所致。以一班級單位而論，最高者年達六千元，而最低者年僅百元，相差六十倍，此種差異，州與州不同，同一州內之縣與縣不同，鄕與鄕不同，而家庭貧富懸殊亦足驚人。兒童同爲國家寳庫，有事　機會均等敎育的權利，不能因地方與家庭經濟力之不同而削奪敎育上應有之權利。美國近年來對於敎育經濟學敎育財政學之研究，有極大之進步與眞獻，敎育學者甚能注意到國民經濟的發展，與敎育經濟的相互關係，把敎育經濟納入敎育應有之領域以內，圖謀打破經濟上敎育機會之不均等，實施敎育財政上的均衡計劃。此一計劃的內容，係根據各州現有各校級的經費，求得各州的平均數，再將各州的平均數列成一表，取其中數目定爲全國最低限度的標準。各州以內各地方之差異，亦照此辦法，定一某州之最低限度的標準，各地方要依其財富情形，及籌集經費的努力程度，完成該地方之最低標準，不足之數應由州統籌補足之。各州要依其財富情形及努力程度，完成全國最低限度的標準，不足之數由聯邦撥款補足之。換言之，聯邦撥款標準，依照各州完成全國最低限度標準所需要的數目而定，距離全國最低限度標準愈低者，撥款愈多，愈高者愈少，或不予撥助。各州對其地方之辦法，亦復如此。此一均衡計劃，目的在救濟經濟上的障礙，加連機會均等。聯邦方面，已由國會一再通過撥款法案，各州已在分別實施，此一計劃將繼續推進，繼續提高標準，為今後敎育行政上之一大要政。</p>
<p>（四）幼嬰敎育之重視與小學個差之適應：各大學多設有幼嬰敎育系，硏究幼嬰敎育的人數，比例上逐年增加，各地設立幼嬰敎育班者亦均與年俱進，良以幼嬰時代的個差，及興趣之發展與培育，實佔重要地位，而父母因工作關係，未能照顧幼嬰，致影響其將來，此乃社會上的責任，敎育者的工作，今後對幼嬰敎育的發展當無止境。至在各小學階段。近來最顯著之進步，爲對於個性差異的普遍的重視與適應、同一年級之分組有多至四五組之多，每組三五七人不等，按其智育與興趣區分其進程、以組爲單位，有年升三四次者，其學習經騐，亦按照其興趣需要，提示引導之。此項智育與興趣之發現，除班任敎師外，有專家之顧問敎師，有專家之心理學敎師，又有專科醫師及精神病學家，均由敎育行政機關派任，大規模之學校各人齊全，分散之小規模學校，則劃區派任之，而顧問敎師與心理學專家敎師，尤爲普遍。近若干年來，小學敎育方面，對於敎學的實際化，實有一大進步。（未完）</p>

<h3>四聯總處修正　投資貼放辦法　國營民營同樣看待</h3>
<p>中中交農四行聯合辦事總處，爲配合政府經濟復員政策，及平衡物價，促進生產起見，特修正核辦投資貼放方針，對於國營及民營事業之投資放款，貸款者應採之方式，以及應遵守各點等，亦經同時修正，茲特探誌如下：</p>
<p>凡公私工礦及農林事業，投資申請債款案件，一律先由四聯總分支處指派專門人員，或委託有關主管機關切實調査各該業之人事組織，業務，廠產，設備及經營成績，凡適合下列條件者，方可投放。</p>
<p>（一）業務適合經濟復員政策，平衡物價，促進生產，暢通貿易，而經營具有成績者。</p>
<p>（二）組織健全，技術優良及出品暢銷者。</p>
<p>（三）機器設備原料能繼續補給，並已正式開工，或最短期內開工者。</p>
<p>（四）借款用途正當者。</p>
<p>至於國營事業機關，如需以預算核定款項，先行抵借備用時，應由主管機關保證財政部備案後再向四行兩局治辦。</p>
<p>凡在政府預算以外，而爲推行國策，應辦之緊急事業需要款項時，應由中央最高主管機關，商得財政部同意，並保證後再行洽辦。</p>
<p>如在政府預算以外，商借流動資金，而以本身能力償還者，應照審核民營事業借款辦法辦理，並由主管機關負責保證。</p>
<p>四聯對於投資放款協助之民營事業各單位之財務會計，應詳加稽核，如認為必要，得派員駐在各單位辦理之，四聯如認為各該單位之財務會計有須改善之處，各該單位應儘量接受。</p>
<p>承受投放事業單位之生產物品，應達一定限度，其每月產銷數量與價値應按期表報四聯查核。</p>
<p>各貨借單位所製產品，如查有囤積居奇情事，所有放款本息，無論到期與否，該處當即收回。</p>
<p>關於出口貿易產品，凡已到達出口商埠之貨物，應由出口商向銀行辦理結匯，及申請打包放款或承兌匯票。</p>
<p>至於在產地收購貨物之商人，於產地採辦原料及製造包裝轉運時，可向四行兩局商做押款及押匯，此項押款期限，最長不得逾三個月。</p>
<p>凡商家以民生必需品押借者，應以經營本業之商人，並加人各該業同業公會者爲限，在復員期問，各業因流動資金不敷週轉，得以所存原料或成品爲質押品，在不助長囤積居奇之原則下，通融申請借款，又今後交通運輸當較便利，各生產事業，由外埠購買原料物料或將成品運銷外埠時，亦可向四聯申請辦理押匯，惟押款期限最長不得超過三個月，並不得展期。</p>
<p>又該處幷規定凡中央政府機關，以前以應領經費抵借各款，期滿應即淸結，不得展期。</p>
<p>凡地方政府機關，以前向四行所借各款，應按照財政部規定統一國庫收支辦法限期淸結。</p>
<p>凡中央及地方政府機關，所屬之工礦交通農林水利貿易等事業，對於四行已有負債關係者，應由四聯調査其業務，必要時得於未到期前收回放款之一部份或全部。</p>
<p>上述所指之各種放款外，其餘聯合貼放各款，並應一律加緊督促借款人依約履行還本付息。</p>
<p>又據四聯總處權威方面稱，今後凡屬工礦廠商行號，有須貸借款項者，須手續完備後，方能申請，政府當局爲求國營與民營事業相輔配合發展，故對國營及民營事業之營運資金借款，決同樣看待，以免除重此輕彼云。</p>
<h3>警局不斷巡視　公債依然活躍</h3>
<p>公債昨以大戶假滿　來，稍有活動，集合地點化整爲零，東西凑集，尙被警局不時驅散，統丙晨開即躍升爲五七〇〇元以上，買戶繼續爭吸，中途創五九八〇元新高價，惟大千元光景之價，不久即因賣買不能十分順利進行遭受阻折，多頭獲利落袋，逐漸回落，低價步降至五六〇〇元，最後仍站住五七〇〇元以上，結果較週六甲乙漲四七〇元，丙升二五〇元，丁四〇〇元，戊漲三〇〇元。</p>
<h3>墨國汽油　分裝來華</h3>
<p>〔路透社墨西哥城廿二日電〕商務日報載稱：中國油糟船「Hung　Cho」號，現正在坦比哥城裝載大量汽油備運上海交貨。Hung　Cho號爲首次椗泊坦比哥之中國商船。據悉：另有大批汽油定貨，均將由中國油糟船運交中國。中國已成爲墨西哥汽油之新市塲矣。</p>
<h3>米貸的結果　市價穩站高峯　傳有一萬包將到滬　糧政處商抑平辦法</h3>
<p>第一期米業貸款十萬萬元，開始發放之初期，竟引起米價高漲，各界俱表不滿，認爲措置失富，市政府及糧政當局殊為重視，除勸吿獲有米貸者立即赴產區採購，一面派員在市塲密査，有無利用貸款在市上收囤食米情事，茲悉獲得借款之米商，在當局嚴密監視及輿論督促之下，確已大部份派員前往蘇州·無錫·松江·崑山·靑浦·嘉善等產區實行採辦，其中已有一萬石由陸路運滬，此後陸續運到，隨時在市拋售，供應需要，據糧政當局宣稱：今後米價，在存到俱充之情形下，當可逐漸回低，嗣後盼望各大工廠或行號，需要食米，切勿在市上大量購進，而引起米價之上漲，倘需大量購買，以直接前往產地採辦爲最宜，糧政當局極願從旁協助，予以便利，並悉糧政特派員辦公處昨日上午曾召集該處所屬各粉廠碾米廠及糧商負責人，舉行會議，由代理特派員汪達人主持，據聞除檢討過去工作外，並對今後抑平米價，安定市面等問題，加以討論云。</p>
<p>昨日米似早堅午懈，無甚呼吸，麵粉另消甚暢，供不應求，依然步砌，再漲三四百元，雜牌粉加七八百元，麩皮內地消化亦仍蟬聯，價格再漲五百元，黃豆浙方略取，本街另星動辦價升千餘元，豆餅早緊午　，價加百元，生仁仍居站平之狀，赤豆香港呂宋納胃甚股，售主益堅，形趨求過於供，擯而不開，油市以來貨尙湧，銷路尙可，勢則到銷兩敵，菜油靑油豆油均加五六百至千元左右。據米市塲息：昨日本市計到白粳等八種，共八千八百餘石，其種類及石數如下：白粳三·九六四石，薄稻二·〇二四石，早稻一·六四三石，羊秈一二八石，杜秈六〇二石，蕪秈一二〇石，白元二〇〇石，陰元一八〇石。</p>
<h3>紗市平庸　小型紗去路尙旺</h3>
<p>昨日紗市平庸之至，二十支雙馬約小一萬，因粤帮暫無進意，致大型廠紗毫無生色，反之小型紗欣欣向榮，續升一萬餘元，京滬沿綫各埠來客，對中小型二十支紗需求頗殷，現貨仍感供不敷求，昨又屈紡建開紗之期，照例掛牌供售二十九稱紗綫，自一支至一百支，各色俱備，四中二支價標低四五萬，餘均平平。</p>
<h3>現棉交易頗盛</h3>
<p>昨日紐約美棉繼續停市，仍無電訊，本埠現棉交易益見起色，廠家買花紡紗，獲利甚厚，是以民營紗廠需要孔亟，同業吸意仍健，統計成交一千三五百包，市價緊俏，續升一二千元。</p>
<h3>呢羢續有定到</h3>
<p>呢絨市面，昨仍少有起色，零銷尙佳，躉交有限，英美定貸續有運到，如萬力頂女色呢花呢等，此外做西裝爲標本之畢跡圖樣，亦有到埠，聞每本成本價格係八角半美金，市售價格則爲二萬元，同業鑒於到貨獲利豐厚，俱欲捷足先得，爭先訂定，昨如怡和，羅福，昌明等洋行，咸有成交云。</p>
<h3>金鈔均疲</h3>
<p>烚赤昨形平和，時局關係，人心尙穩，最開稍高，證券帮逢高了結，中行配售價雖未更動，無人發記，惟供方見金市轉入盤局，紛紛供給，中途曾步降至一五五萬，而後始漸平定，但回漲之勢亦屬有限，午刻在一五六萬左右，午後亦呈平庸，結果較上週六續跌一萬五，銀樓飾金十六萬八，紋銀一千六，銀元仍吿平定，暗拆平平，息價自一角二至一角半。</p>
<p>外幣美鈔結款轉少，買氣遂寂，持有者紛起脫手，美商行續有供給，籌碼漸形鬆動，自晨初二二二〇元盤旋而下，午前曾退至二一五〇元，午刻在二一七〇元右徘徊，午後勢可稍疲，退落十元，結果較前收續跌五十五元，港票以大勢不利，亦被帶小五元，港電四一五元，羅比五一五元，美匯掛牌仍平，指定銀行二〇五〇元稍有供給。</p>
<h3>華股實行隔日交割　市塲買氣頓盛　外股怡紗英聯最熱</h3>
<p>華股昨　中實行隔日交割，人心稍受刺激。晟開即見徽挺，開後買風一度趨盛，永紗漲至五二五〇元，美亞四四五〇元，景福四五〇元，獲利者紛紛撈進，　後轉艦，此後交易遂步閑散，市况亦由絢爛轉人平淡，市價不進則退，午刻都呈低價，永紗美亞後者買戶觀望，美亞稍稍遜色，勤典套買轉股，價較新光爲挺，午收較上週六計永紗漲二八〇元，美亞僅升五十元，景福漲十元，新光十八元，勤興獨昂三十三元，其他各股升沈均微。元老股亦然，外股投機力量集中怡紗英聯，兩熱門上塲均已升至一四〇〇〇元大關外，證券帮見勢又熱，紛來追補，兩大熱門扶搖直上，近午迫近一五大關，午收終吿穿出，結果較上週六怡紗英聯各漲一成弱，餘則跟漲半成左右。</p>
<h3>第三期配給　人造絲五百箱</h3>
<p>本報訊，第三期人造絲配給五百箱，即日起已由電機同業公會辦理申請手續，其定價探錄如下，一二〇號有光一百三十六萬元，一二〇號半光一百三十八萬元，七五號半光一百四十一萬元。</p>
<h3>中國蠶絲　美絲業極歡迎　但須價廉而穩定</h3>
<p>〔路透社紐約廿二日電〕據商務日報稱：此間絲業界認爲中國貨幣上種種困難問題，業經充分澄淸，足以恢復華絲之進口貿易，並宣稱，頗願接受中國爲絲之永久供應來源。彼等以爲雖有混合織維織物之競爭，天然絲之市塲，在美國仍佔有其確實之地仁，貿易商人均願進行廣大計劃，以發展天然絲之新用途，並改進天然絲之質地云。</p>
<p>〔路透社紐約二十二日電〕美國試騐公司經理杜丹最近會代表美國政府巡視日本，頃已歸國。渠稱：如絲綢欲與人造絲織品競爭，則須注重品質而非價格。爲使紡織廠再行採用蠶絲起見，則必先使其以絲爲原料較以人造絲爲原料更能獲利。絲價必須予以穩定，對於品質尤須注意。</p>
<h3>食糖標價又升</h3>

<h3>YVA電力圈巡禮</h3>
<p>— 林漢</p>
<p>依照薩凡奇的揚子江水電工程計劃，在宜昌峽口建一水電工程，電廠設於山洞內（爲了防止空襲計），裝發電機九十部，每部約十五萬匹馬力，共約一千五百萬匹馬力，計發電一千萬零五十六萬瓩，其供應河達南京·宜賓·成都·桂林·貴陽·天水等地，且此工程可以吸收揚子江的大洪水，灌溉農田約六千萬英畝，排水量一萬噸的巨輪可直達重慶……。</p>
<p>這，的確是一個堂皇而很不平凡的計劃，自從薩儿奇向蔣主席及美政府提出以後，中美兩國的政府，工業家，工程家，平民沒有不念念不忘，朝夕憧憬着它的！因此，我想發展YVA的計劃的腹稿，早已在各人的心目中草成了，所謂「萬事俱備，只等東風。」只要工程弄好了，什麼計劃都會隨着成爲事實的。我們不妨先到這YVA電力圈裏神遊一次，以觀其梗槪。</p>
<p>爲方便計，我們就拿宜昌做中心，以宜昌到南京或桂林的直綫距離做半徑畫一個圓周，這個圓周便可稱爲YVA電力圈。假如說，從上海出發，乘萬噸的大洋船，浩浩蕩蕩的直放重慶，到了南京，便可以看到電的世界，電車，不必說，要比上海的外商電車來得快，來得多，車水馬龍，大可以不必排長蛇陣候車，或排山倒海的擠車；政治都市的南京，在那時準會長出一些無聲無息的，沒有烟囪的大工廠來！晚上，它仍會是白晝裏的南京。從南京溯江而上，要是夜航的話，你儘可看到岸上一座座的，光芒四射的城市，無綫電的廣播儘會給困處征航上的你以安慰，替你驅逐單調，寂寞到了武漢，你也許奇怪，全國重工業中心的武漢，林立的烟突，也許减少了，也許有一部分不吐黑烟了，但是當你入去廠房參觀的時候，你可以看到它的機器還在天翻地覆的動着呢！此外，你可以發現許多掛着上海或　　的老牌子廠家，或新興的什麼電化廠，電冶廠，電工廠。……等點綴着偉大的武漢。而且，在這裏，你不必照從前的習慣，叫一輛人力車把你拖到中山公園或落伽山去玩一次，你祗要花一根香烟的代價登上電車，便可舒舒服服的到達目的地。還有，在這裏，你可以在應有盡有的工業品裏選購一些價廉物美的，勝過舶來品的東西，包你十足滿意。船抵宜昌—這是一個聞名中外的地方，工廠林立，不愧爲VYA工業中心！宜昌上行，過工程偉大的水閘，那裏將用巨型起重機或絞車將這萬噸的大船吊上去，或大開水閘讓巨輪衝上去！入三峽後，你免不了要站在甲板上，瀏覽巍峨峻峭的垂崖絕壁，但是你會聽到機器聲振耳欲聾，你可以看到一個個的石洞面前掛着「謝絕參觀」的木牌子，你可以想到裏面除了深藏着發電廠外，還隱蔽着許多國防性的重工業呢！到了重慶，那裏的市民一定會帶着驚喜的心情來歡迎你這萬噸大船，那時，你看到戰後衰退而又重現活躍的重慶，光明的陪都再不致分區停電了，工廠再不會因爲缺煤停工了！到此你須得其與你所乘的大洋船分手了，你可以在成渝街上嚐嚐電化火車的味道，在半路上，你可到着流井去看一看那裏的電解食鹽工業。成都，有名的古色古香的城市，穿上了薄薄的現時代的衣裳，綴着輕工業或電化工業；從此北出天水，由寳天，隴海，津浦三鐵路再回到南京，沿途你盡可看到蠭起的民族工業，以前純粹的農村生活起了革命，人民的生活永準提高了，生活不再沾上外國貨了！他們已到了自給自足的境地！或者從重慶南行到貴陽，你可以看到以貧瘠稱著的貴州改了面目，「人無三分銀」的諺語不再適用了。此外，貴州蘊藏着的鋁礦將被大量的製鍊出來。再從貴陽乘黔桂鐵路火車到桂林，這次担保不會因煤質劣或缺煤而拋錨於荒山野嶺裏；到了桂林，那裏的蓬勃的輕工業，淸澈的市容，熙來攘往的遊客，曾給予你很好的印象！由此你便又可沿湘桂路，粵漢路看看中國的穀倉—湖南，電氣化的農業，將引起你極大的興趣！</p>
<p>如此大略的走了一趟，你總會覺得在這個大圈子裏，的確是改了面目，眞有五花八門，什麼都是電，看不盡，說不盡，有喜不勝之感呢！</p>

        <h1>1946.04.23</h1>
<h3>Marshall and Zhou Enlai Meet, Discussing a Truce in the Northeast</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 22nd] Marshal Marshall's return to Chongqing five days ago has caused widespread anxiety among various parties. It is reported that Marshal Marshall and Mr. Zhou Enlai met on the morning of the 22nd. At 5:30 PM, Mr. Suthard, the chargé d'affaires of the American Embassy, ​​invited leaders of various parties to dinner at the American Embassy to introduce them to Marshal Marshall's wife. It is still difficult to predict when the three-person military team can start. However, the general belief is that Marshal Marshall's meeting with Zhou Enlai this time may reveal a glimmer of hope for the Northeast issue.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] San Francisco Broadcast: Communist representative Zhou Enlai met with Marshall today and reportedly made an unconditional ceasefire demand in the Northeast.</p>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 22nd] Special Envoy Marshall met with Chairman Chiang this afternoon. The content is unknown.</p>
<p>[United Press International, Chongqing, 22nd] Zhou Enlai, the Communist representative of the Military Three-Person Team, consulted with Special Envoy Marshall for two and a half hours today, explaining the Communist Party's position. It is reported that Marshall listened but did not comment. Although the content of Zhou Enlai's conversation with Marshall has not been disclosed, the Communist Party side indicates that this discussion is closely related to the Communist Party's recent assertion that the government must unconditionally cease conflict in the Northeast. Because the Communist Party now occupies a superior military strategic position, if the National Army attempts to seize its land by force, a bloody battle will inevitably ensue. Marshall also consulted with Vice Minister of Military and Political Affairs Yu Dawei this afternoon, and Yu agreed to cooperate fully.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] News reports: The situation is becoming more complex and serious due to the occupation of Changchun. However, it is believed that the talks between the government and Marshall will lead to a peaceful resolution. It is generally believed that the Communist Army will try to defend Changchun and develop natural resources within its ruling area for future use. Therefore, it is highly doubtful that the usual mediation efforts will succeed. After the occupation of Changchun, Marshall and General Gillon have gained a deep and new understanding of the Communist Party's political and military strategies. Therefore, it is expected that the conflict cessation method proposed by Marshall this time will be very different from previous agreements. It is also reported that Marshall already suspects a plan to resolve the Northeast incident, and it is expected that both sides will do their best to seize control of land before the ceasefire order is issued.</p>
<h3>Chairman Chiang's Address During Commemoration Week, Instructing on Matters Related to the Return to the Capital; First Batch of Diplomatic Corps Personnel Arrives in Nanjing from Chongqing</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 22nd] Whether the return to the capital and the convocation of the National Assembly can be realized as scheduled are the two major events currently attracting national attention. As of today, judging from various indications, it fully proves that the rumors circulating outside that the events will be delayed are unfounded. Hong Lanyou, the person in charge of the National Assembly Preparatory Committee, stated publicly today that the committee has not made any instructions to slightly delay the preparatory work. On the contrary, his colleagues will add night shifts in the coming days, hoping to make the upcoming grand event as perfect as possible in terms of administrative affairs. Today, more than 20 representatives from as far away as Henan and Shaanxi arrived by special plane. Other representatives from various places have pre-announced their itineraries and will arrive in Nanjing one after another in the coming days. Dozens of workers are rushing to build wooden colored archways to the left and right of the National Assembly Hall of the National Government and opposite it, creating a magnificent scene. As for the schedule for the return to the capital, although the air transport plan has been slightly changed due to the Northeast war, it is expected that the five days from the 25th of this month to the end of the month will reach a climax. Chairman Chiang will receive a grand farewell from all sectors of the accompanying capital on the 24th and fly to Chengdu for one or two days, possibly returning to Nanjing at the end of the month.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 22nd] At the 9:00 AM Commemoration Week on the 22nd, after Chairman Chiang led the ceremony, Pu Xuefeng, the Deputy Director-General of the Executive Headquarters, reported on the recent work of the headquarters. Chairman Chiang gave instructions on matters related to the return to the capital: (1) For civil servants of various departments and commissions and their families who have special difficulties during the return to the capital, the supervisors should consider the situation and help them solve them and provide relief. (2) Currently, there is a lack of transportation. Supervisors should distinguish the priority of personnel and file transportation. Personnel and files that are not important to business can be left in Chongqing and transported to Beijing after water transportation is smooth. Finally, encourage all civil servants to return to Nanjing with the spirit of moving the capital to Chongqing eight years ago, to be worried and vigilant, and to work hard.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] Duan Xipeng, a member of the Central Standing Committee, flew from Chongqing to Beijing this morning to preside over the work of the Central Training Committee. Xue Dubi, chairman of the Water Conservancy Commission of the Executive Yuan, also flew to Beijing at the same time. Most of the important personnel of the commission have already gone to Beijing, and the rest of the personnel can also return to the capital at the end of the month.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 22nd] The first batch of diplomatic mission personnel returning to the capital arrived in the capital by plane from Chongqing at 2:30 PM on the 22nd. Among them were Ms. Fairbank, cultural specialist of the US Embassy, ​​Mr. Mel, second secretary, and five attendants. Mr. Codus, first secretary of the British Embassy, ​​and Mr. McKings, second secretary, and five others.</p>
<h3>Government Committee and National Assembly Representative Lists; Communist Party Still Refuses to Submit; Zhang Qun and Others Reply to Zhou Enlai Asking to Pay Attention to Responsibility</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Chongqing, 22nd] The Communist Party officially announced today that they had requested four ministerial positions in the reorganized Executive Yuan and ten seats on the National Government Committee, so that together with the votes of the Democratic League, they would obtain a veto. The announcement pointed out that the Communist Party cannot publish the list of government and National Assembly representatives until various issues such as the cessation of conflict in the Northeast and whether the government accepts the above-mentioned number of seats are resolved. According to the Communist Party, the representatives participating in the government have been selected, but if issues such as political freedom and the implementation of the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference are not resolved, Yan'an does not intend to submit the list of representatives. A spokesperson said: If the issues are resolved, the National Assembly representatives sent by the Communist Party can still arrive in Nanjing before May 5th. The date of the Communist personnel's move to Beijing is uncertain, but "if Chairman Chiang and General Marshall move to Nanjing, Zhou Enlai must also go to Beijing for work."</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 22nd] Zhou Enlai wrote to government representatives Zhang Qun, Shao Lizi, and Zhang Lisheng on the 21st, and attached a statement from the Chinese Communist Party representative, stating that they cannot consider candidates to participate in the National Government and submit a list of National Assembly representatives at this time. Zhang Qun, Shao Lizi, and Zhang Lisheng immediately replied in a letter. The original letter is recorded as follows: "Mr. Enlai, greetings. Yesterday, we received your letter of April 21 and the attached statement from your party delegation. We have already forwarded it to Mr. Zhe Sheng (Sun Ke), Tie Cheng (Wu Tiecheng), Liang Hao (Wang Chonghui), Xue Ting (Wang Shijie), and Li Fu (Chen Lifu). Our unanimous opinion is that at this time, we should still make our best efforts to ensure the success of the Political Consultative Conference agreement. We do not want to argue about the points in the statement of your party delegation that do not match the facts. The date for the convocation of the National Assembly agreed upon by the Political Consultative Conference is extremely imminent. We are willing to make our final efforts, and we sincerely hope that you will act with the greatest sense of responsibility and immediately disclose the list of representatives so that the National Assembly can be convened as scheduled. If the meeting is delayed as a result, the responsibility will be assigned. Sincerely, may you be well."</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 22nd] The construction of the Jiangnan Seawall has entered the implementation stage.

The Executive Headquarters can allocate 50 million to 100 million yuan. The Director of the Department will go to Shanghai later to convene a meeting of the county chiefs of the four counties and the directors of the Relief Association to discuss the direction of implementation.

<h3>Chen Bi-jun Sentenced to Life Imprisonment, Chu Min-yi Sentenced to Death: Suzhou High Court Announced Verdict Yesterday Afternoon</h3>
<p>[Special Correspondent of This Newspaper in Suzhou, 22nd] At 3 PM on the 22nd, the Suzhou High Court announced the verdict in the treason case of Chu Min-yi. Presiding Judge Sun Honglin, Chief Justice Shi Meiyu, Justice Lu Jiarui, Prosecutor Wei Weiqing, and Clerk Zhu Wuqiu ascended the bench. Chu Min-yi was brought to the court. After the presiding judge inquired about his name, he stood up and, in a very solemn tone, read the main text of the judgment: "1. Chu Min-yi, in collusion with an enemy country, plotted to resist this country, and is sentenced to death, with perpetual deprivation of civil rights, and all his property, except for the necessary living expenses for his family, shall be confiscated." The presiding judge then read the reasons for the judgment aloud. Upon hearing the verdict, Chu Min-yi's face turned pale, his lips trembled, and he appeared to be痉挛 (spasmodic). He repeatedly attempted to express his feelings about being sentenced to death, but was prevented by the court. At 3:04 PM, Chu Min-yi was led away. The court then summoned Chen Bi-jun to the court. Presiding Judge Sun Honglin again read the main text of the judgment, which was identical to Chu's case except that Chen was sentenced to life imprisonment. Although Chen had appeared very assertive during the trial, at this moment, tears welled up in her eyes, and she frequently wiped them with a handkerchief. The court informed both convicts that if they were not satisfied with the judgment, they could apply for a retrial within ten days. However, even if the defendants did not wish to request a retrial, the High Court was legally obligated to apply to the Supreme Court for a retrial. When Chu heard the verdict, he forcibly composed himself and said, "I am very satisfied. I said during the last trial that I was ready to die, and now my wish has been fulfilled. Those outside who hoped for strict punishment of traitors can now also be satisfied. The prosecutor has achieved his goal and is probably also satisfied." The court sternly rebuked him, stating, "This court sentenced you to death not because of your own request, nor based on public opinion, but based on your actions." Chu Min-yi continued to chatter on, so the presiding judge angrily said, "The court's time is not for the defendant to use arbitrarily. If you have any reasons for dissatisfaction, you can submit them in writing." Chu Min-yi then remained silent and was led away. After Chen stated that she was not satisfied when asked by the presiding judge "Are you satisfied," she replied with tears in her eyes: "Of course I am not satisfied, but I will not appeal." The presiding judge then said, "It's not an appeal, it's an application for a retrial. It's good that you expressed disagreement, and you can write down the reasons." At this point, Chen gradually regained her old assertive demeanor and replied, "There's no need to write it down. It's the same anyway. A revolutionary naturally has too many opportunities to die." She finished speaking and was led away. The time was 3:25 PM. (The original text of both judgments is published on page 2.)</p>
<p>From 1 PM, the Suzhou High Court inside and outside was already crowded with spectators, with far more women than men, which surprised reporters. At 2:45 PM, the High Court issued an order, and the Suzhou Police Chief led three bailiffs, with a carriage, to the detention center. On the way, the crowd was as thick as a wall. Chen was wearing a blue cloth qipao, tea-colored crystal glasses, black shoes, and gray socks. Chu was wearing a chestnut-colored silk jacket, meticulously ironed, black leather shoes, and was carrying a file folder. The two convicts walked out of the detention center shoulder to shoulder. When they reached the carriage, they were mutually modest, and as a result, Chen boarded the car first. After arriving at the High Court, the bailiffs ordered Chu into the No. 4 Criminal Waiting Room and Chen into the No. 5 Waiting Room to rest for a while. Each was given a cup of plain water. Chu appeared timid and uneasy, while Chen had a resentful expression. Yesterday, the order of the court was much improved due to the effective command of Secretary-General Yang, but the Central Film Studio did not come to film.</p>
<p>When Chu was taken out of the court, he distributed several copies of his "Thoughts After the Verdict," which were written on carbon copy paper, to the reporters. He personally signed his name in ink at the end of the document, but the wording was absurd and vulgar, and most reporters discarded them.</p>
<p>After the court session, the reporter visited High Court President Sun Honglin regarding Chen Bi-jun's (Li Jianzhuang, wife of Gong Bo, wrote Chen's "Request for Retrial," in which she raised new facts) and inquired whether it was necessary to summon witnesses again. President Sun replied, "According to the law, new evidence cannot be presented during the third trial." He also said that the possible actions of the Supreme Court after the request for retrial are as follows: (1) Approve the original judgment and submit the case to the Judicial Administration Department for further review, and after confirmation, the execution will be scheduled. (2) Return the case to the original court for a retrial. (3) Transfer the case to Nanjing for a retrial. Because President Sun was the Chief Prosecutor of the Suzhou High Court who handled the "Seven Gentlemen" case of Shen Junru and others in his younger years, the reporter mentioned the old events, President Sun could not help but become colored and said: "They weren't happy with me back then, and now when I look at it, how could I have let them go back then?"</p>
<p>Chief Justice Shi Meiyu personally supervised the printing of the judgments of Chu and Chen, carefully proofreading and being extremely cautious. He told reporters that he would be going to Beijing in two or three days because he also serves as the Chief Justice of the Beijing Military Tribunal. There are twenty-five Japanese war criminals in Nanjing who will be awaiting him to preside over the trial. The judgments of the three major traitors in this trial of the Suzhou High Court were all drafted by Shi, who worked diligently day and night and appeared slightly thin, but remained energetic, talking and laughing happily. He said: The uniforms of the judges of the Military Tribunal will be military uniforms with swords, which are different from ordinary judges. He was originally in Shanghai before the incident, and then went to Tunxi after the war, so he still cannot forget the fine wine of Tunxi.</p>

<h3>Obstacles to the Restoration of Traffic in Shandong Province: Repair Work Stalled Again; An Ding Attacked, Tianjin-Pukou Train Service Interrupted</h3>
<p>[Special Correspondent of This Newspaper in Jinan, 22nd] Since the 20th, the repair work on all railway lines in Shandong Province has been completely halted again. The Communist army stated that it had received orders from above not to continue repairing forward.</p>
<p>[Special Correspondent of This Newspaper in Nanjing, 22nd] It is reported that the Military Three-Person Committee meeting will be reopened soon, and the restoration of traffic will be listed as the main topic. Recently, the restoration of traffic on the Jinpu, Jiaoji, and Longhai trunk lines has been very slow, because while they are being repaired, they are also being destroyed by the Communist army. Currently, the total length of restored sections on these three trunk lines is less than 100 kilometers. According to people from Shanxi, the mediation work in Shanxi is doubtful due to the lack of sincerity of the Communist Party, and the restoration of traffic is nowhere in sight.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 21st] The Military Mediation Executive Department Qinxian Team arrived in Qin from Bing on the evening of the 19th, and agreed to restore the Qin (County) Jin (City) light railway on the 20th.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 22nd] Several hundred Communist soldiers suddenly attacked the area of Sanhuali near Anding Station on the Tianjin-Pukou Railway line at 11:15 AM today. The gunfire was dense for a time. One artillery shell landed inside Anding Station. All Tianjin-Pukou trains were suspended. The Communist soldiers retreated by 1 PM, and traffic resumed.</p>
<h3>Judgment of Chu Min-yi</h3>
<p>Criminal Judgment No. 408 of the Jiangsu High Court, Special Character of the 35th Year</p>
<p>Prosecutor: This Court's Prosecutor.</p>
<p>Defendant: Chu Min-yi, male, 64 years old, from Wuxing, Zhejiang Province, Ji'nantao Town.</p>
<p>Designated Defender: Gao Rong, Public Defender of Wu County.</p>
<p>Regarding the defendant's case of treason, the prosecutor of this court filed a lawsuit, and this court ruled as follows:</p>
<p>Main Text: Chu Min-yi, in collusion with an enemy country, plotted to resist this country, and is sentenced to death, with perpetual deprivation of civil rights. All property is confiscated, except for the necessary living expenses for his family.</p>
<p>Facts: Chu Min-yi was a close relative of Wang Jingwei, and originally served as a member of the Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang and Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan. After the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, he took refuge in Shanghai. Later, in the summer of the 28th year of the Republic [1939], Wang arrived in Shanghai and secretly conspired with the Japanese to negotiate peace, and convened the Sixth National Congress of the puppet Kuomintang. Chu Min-yi immediately participated, serving as the Secretary-General of the puppet Central Party Headquarters, a member of the Central Executive Committee, and a member of the Supervisory Committee. He followed Wang in running between Nanjing and Qingdao, discussing the reorganization of the puppet "United Reform" and "Provisional" governments. After an agreement was reached, the puppet National Government was established in Nanjing on March 10, 29th year of the Republic [1940]. Wang served as the puppet chairman and puppet premier, and Chu Min-yi served as the puppet deputy premier and puppet foreign minister, and presided over the relocation of the puppet government. Also, in May of the same year, as the puppet deputy envoy, he accompanied Chen Gongbo to Japan to return the courtesy, and then concluded the Sino-Japanese Basic Relations Treaty with the Japanese, allowing the Japanese to station troops in Mengjiang and North China, and station a fleet in China's territorial waters, and implement economic cooperation. At the same time, he issued a joint Sino-Japanese-Manchukuo declaration, recognizing Manchukuo, in order to destroy China's territorial integrity. In February of the following year, he was transferred to serve as the puppet ambassador to Japan, liaising with the Axis countries to recognize the puppet government. In September, he returned to China and continued to serve as the puppet foreign minister. After the puppet government declared war on Britain and the United States in the 32nd year of the Republic [1943], he again concluded the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty with the Japanese, and accompanied Wang to Tokyo to participate in the Greater East Asia Conference. He repeatedly used fallacies to promote the destruction of Britain and the United States and the elimination of the Central Government. In July of the 34th year of the Republic [1945], he served as the puppet governor of Guangdong Province, the puppet commander of the Guangdong Provincial Security Forces, and the puppet pacification director of Guangzhou. Shortly after, the Japanese surrendered. Then he was detained by the Military Affairs Commission's Investigation and Statistics Bureau, and transferred by the General Headquarters of the Chinese Army to the prosecutor of this court for investigation and prosecution.</p>
<p>Reasons: The defendant in this case, Chu Min-yi, jointly organized the puppet National Government with Wang Jingwei, serving in various important party and government positions, and accompanied Chen Gongbo to Japan to return the courtesy. During his tenure as the puppet ambassador to Japan, he liaised with the Axis to recognize the puppet government, and later accompanied Wang to the east to participate in the Greater East Asia Conference. Also, during his tenure as the puppet foreign minister, he concluded the Sino-Japanese Basic Relations Treaty and the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty with the Japanese, issued the joint Sino-Japanese-Manchukuo declaration, and declared war on our Allied countries of Britain and the United States, expressing his intention to live and die with the Japanese. Finally, he served as the puppet governor of Guangdong Province and other positions, which he himself has admitted without denying. This is consistent with his "Self-Description of Participating in the Peace Movement" and the confessions of accomplices Chen Gongbo and Chen Fengjun in another case. There are also the seized appointment certificates of the puppet National Government, the "Joint Declaration of the Greater East Asia Conference," and the "Record of the Puppet National Government's Delegation to Japan to Return Courtesy," "The Theory and Implementation of the Political Program of the Puppet National Government," "The Conclusion of the Sino-Japanese Treaty and the Greater East Asia War," and "Domestic News Clipping Books," which can be used as evidence. His traitorous acts of colluding with the enemy are extremely clear. He should be charged with the crime under Article 2, Paragraph 1, Item 1 of the Regulations on the Punishment of Traitors. Although he argued: "The puppet government resisted Japan peacefully, and the armed resistance of Chongqing was a division of labor, with different routes but the same destination. The territory in which it exercised puppet power was taken from the hands of the Japanese, originally hoping to rescue the people and preserve vitality, and prepare to seize the opportunity to counterattack, in order to coordinate. How can it be said to be treason? As for the Japanese concluding treaties, issuing declarations, and declaring war on Britain and the United States, they were all signed by Wang, and the defendant did not co-sign them, nor is he responsible. Moreover, during the relocation of the puppet government, he worked hard to build and restore prosperity, and also negotiated the recovery of the British and American concessions, which was not without merit." However, after investigation, (1) the defendant consistently advocated uniting with the Japanese to destroy the Central Government. This is evident from the defendant's broadcasts "Commemorating the Second Anniversary of the Relocation of the Puppet Government" and "Reviewing and Understanding 918," recorded on enemy records, and the defendant's words recorded on page 21 of "The Conclusion of the Sino-Japanese Treaty and the Greater East Asia War" compiled and printed by the puppet Propaganda Department. Moreover, the resolution of the puppet Central Political Conference in which the defendant participated also contained the record that "All internal and external government orders, treaties, agreements, and contracts of Chongqing are invalid." Later, as the puppet ambassador to Japan, he colluded with the Axis, recognizing the puppet government, hoping to deprive the National Government of its international status. This is enough to show his deliberate efforts to stand against the Central Government. Now, to say that it is a division of labor is obviously contradictory. As for the suggestion of coordinating with the National Army at the opportune moment, it is a mere empty promise, and it is difficult to believe. Moreover, even if the Japanese were making a final struggle before their collapse, if the defendant and the puppet government personnel had indeed prepared to break away from their bonds to show their inclination towards the Central Government, it would be a clear sign that they saw the general trend was gone, hoping to preserve themselves, and it cannot be used as favorable proof for them. (2) At the beginning of the war, the enemy's forces were fierce, and our army shifted its position for strategic reasons, and adopted a war of attrition to resist the Japanese attempt to fight a quick battle and win a quick victory. Therefore, in the occupied areas, troops were still deployed, waiting for an opportunity to counterattack, and local governments at all levels also remained on the border, enforcing government orders, originally hoping to recover lost territory and appease the people, with absolutely no intention of abandoning them. However, the Japanese, because the occupied area was too large and difficult to control, used the defendant and Wang to organize the puppet government for their own purposes, causing the National Army to be unable to operate, the Central Government's orders to be unable to be implemented, and the Japanese forces to become increasingly stable, carrying out searches and looting, plunging the people into misery. Tracing the origin of the disaster, the puppet government is responsible. The so-called rescuing the people and preserving vitality is a deceitful talk. (3) The conclusion of the Sino-Japanese Basic Relations Treaty and the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty, the issuance of the joint Sino-Japanese-Manchukuo declaration, and the declaration of war on Britain and the United States, were all done during the defendant's tenure as the puppet foreign minister. That is, the defendant also participated in the pre-event deliberations, and Wang handed all the treaty declarations to the puppet Ministry of Foreign Affairs for processing. Therefore, the defendant, occupying a leading position in this important diplomatic event, should bear joint responsibility. How can he only use Wang's signature and publication as a reason for exemption from responsibility? As for completing the task of relocating the puppet government and negotiating the recovery of the concessions of various countries, they all relied on the power of the Japanese and usurped the authority of the Central Government. This kind of behavior has already constituted a crime, so how can it be used to claim credit? In summary, all kinds of defenses are nothing more than attempts to avoid the issue, and are not sufficient to be adopted. According to the defendant, he was originally a member of the Kuomintang and held an important position in the Central Government, but at a time when the enemy army penetrated deeply and the war was urgent, he did not know how to work together to save the situation, but instead echoed Wang, betrayed the Central Government, and destroyed the anti-Japanese grand plan, which almost shook the foundation of the country. He was indeed willing to take risks, and his crime was unforgivable. Therefore, the extreme penalty is imposed to maintain discipline. All property, except for the necessary living expenses for his family, is confiscated. Based on the above conclusions, in accordance with Article 1 of the Special Regulations on Criminal Cases, the preceding paragraph of Article 291 of the Criminal Procedure Law, Article 1, Article 2, Paragraph 1, Item 1, Article 8, Paragraph 1, Article 9 of the Regulations on the Punishment of Traitors, Article 1 of the Temporary Law on Increased Punishment for Criminal Party Members, the preceding paragraph of Article 2, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law, Article 28, Article 64, Paragraph 1, Article 65, Paragraph 1, Article 57, and Article 37, Paragraph 1, judgment is made as in the main text. This case was executed by Prosecutor Han Tao of this court. April 22, 35th year of the Republic of China [1946], Criminal First Division of the Jiangsu High Court, Presiding Judge Sun Honglin. Judge Shi Meiyu. Lu Jiarui.</p>
<h3>Judgment of Chen Bi-jun</h3>
<p>Criminal Judgment No. 410 of the Jiangsu High Court, Special Character of the 35th Year</p>
<p>Prosecutor: This Court's Prosecutor. Defendant: Chen Bi-jun, female, 56 years old, from Xinhui County, Guangdong Province, residing at No. 30 Fazheng Road, Guangzhou. Public Defender Gao Rong, Public Defender of Wu County. Regarding the defendant's case of treason, the prosecutor of this court filed a lawsuit, and this court ruled as follows:</p>
<p>Main Text: Chen Bi-jun, in collusion with an enemy country, plotted to resist this country, and is sentenced to life imprisonment, with perpetual deprivation of civil rights. All property is confiscated, except for the necessary living expenses for his family.</p>
<p>Facts: Chen Bi-jun is the wife of Wang Jingwei, and originally served as a member of the Central Supervisory Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang. After the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, Wang was used by the enemy chieftain Konoe Fumimaro to secretly negotiate peace, and Chen Bi-jun participated in the deliberations. Then she followed Wang from Chongqing to Hanoi, Vietnam, where Wang issued a pro-peace telegram. Then she went to Shanghai to negotiate a basic plan for peace with the Japanese. On March 30 of the 29th year of the Republic [1940], she organized the puppet National Government in Nanjing. Wang served as the puppet chairman, and Chen Bi-jun served as a member of the puppet Central Party Headquarters Supervisory Committee and a member of the puppet Central Political Committee, and guided the affairs of the puppet party, government, and military in the southwest provinces. At the same time, under the command of Japanese Yasaki Sakai and others, she and her brother, Chen Yaozu, the puppet governor of Guangdong Province, handled Guangdong's affairs. Until Japan surrendered, she began to resign from her position. Detained by the Military Affairs Commission's Investigation and Statistics Bureau, she was transferred to the prosecutor of this court for investigation and prosecution.</p>
<p>Reasons: Regarding the defendant in this case, Chen Bi-jun, having participated in the secret peace negotiations of her husband Wang Jingwei with the Japanese, and after the establishment of the National Government, having held important positions in the party and government and guided the affairs of the puppet party, government, and military in the southwest provinces, she has admitted without denying this in this court and during the investigation. This is consistent with the statements of Chen Gongbo, Chu Min-yi, and other traitors in another case. There is also the special dispatch issued by Wang, which was seized, and the identity card issued by the enemy's special service agency and the puppet Guangdong Provincial Government as evidence. The fact that she handled provincial affairs in Guangdong under the will of Japanese Yasaki Sakai and others, together with Chen Yaozu, is also proven by the telegrams in which Chen Yaozu used the code names "Cliff" and "Hua" to report and request instructions from the defendant. It is certain that her collusion with an enemy country and plotting to resist this country is well-documented and beyond doubt. Although it was argued that Wang initially supported the war of resistance, he later believed that the time for peace had arrived, and he still had the original aspirations of saving the country and the people, and resolutely advocated peace. After the suggestion to the Central Government was ineffective, he left Chongqing and repeatedly discussed with the Japanese to establish another regime to promote comprehensive peace. His mission was more complex and arduous than the war of resistance, and it was parallel to the Central Government's strategy and did not contradict it. At that time, the people in the occupied areas were suffering deeply, and the Central Government was unable to maintain them. The defendant and Wang could not bear to sit idly by and organized the puppet government to rescue them. How can it be said to be colluding with the enemy and betraying the country?" However, after investigating, Wang, at the beginning of the war of resistance, saw that the National Army had suffered setbacks, and his will was suddenly shaken. He did not obtain the consent of the Central Government and agreed to negotiate peace with the Japanese chieftain. He did not hesitate to bow his head to the captives and accept conditions that humiliated the country and deprived it of its power. He also willingly accepted the support of the Japanese to organize the puppet government, forming a situation of confrontation with the Central Government. Its impact on the people's psychology and international observers was profound and great. The resolution of the puppet Central Political Conference on March 22 of the 29th year of the Republic [1940], in addition to declaring that the internal and external government orders and treaties of Chongqing were invalid, also called on all troops to cease fire and await orders, and civil servants to report to Beijing. This is recorded in the book "The Theory and Implementation of the Political Program of the National Government" in the Chen Gongbo case. Its purpose was to obstruct the war of resistance and subvert the government, which is even more obvious. The defendant did not dissuade Wang from his absurd actions, but instead supported him, causing him to be deluded and act arbitrarily, willing to sacrifice great principles and lose national rights to suppress his desire for leadership. Now, to say that Wang's advocacy of peace was also aimed at saving the country and did not hinder the Central Government's policy of resisting Japan is clearly self-deception. Moreover, the Central Government cared for the people in the occupied areas and had local governments at all levels stationed there, implementing government orders under the coordination of the army to carry out rescue work to alleviate the suffering. If Wang and others were not used by the Japanese to implement Qingxiang blockades and obstruct them in various ways, the people's difficulties could have been slightly alleviated. Without planning, the puppet government acted as a tool for the Japanese, facilitating the Japanese control of resources and the looting of wealth, leading to the decline of the people's livelihood, which was even worse than hanging upside down. The so-called purpose of organizing the puppet government was to rescue the people in the occupied areas, which is difficult to justify. Based on what she did, she should be charged with the crime under Article 2, Paragraph 1, Item 1 of the Regulations on the Punishment of Traitors. However, according to the defendant, she and Wang are husband and wife, and she was caught in the web because she echoed his advocacy, which is different from ordinary situations. As for the fact that the defendant presided over the southwest puppet special agents as stated in the indictment, she repeatedly denied it when questioned by the defendant, and the reports of the puppet special agents Liao Gongshao and others that were seized were marked as being submitted to the puppet Central Executive Committee, which is inconsistent with the defendant's title of puppet Supervisory Committee, so it cannot be proven that the defendant participated in the southwest puppet special agents. Therefore, within the scope of the statutory penalty, it is measured as a sentence. All property, except for the necessary living expenses for his family, should be confiscated.</p>
<p>Based on the above conclusions, in accordance with Article 1 of the Special Regulations on Criminal Cases, the preceding paragraph of Article 291 of the Criminal Procedure Law, Article 1, Article 2, Paragraph 1, Item 1, Article 8, Paragraph 1, Article 9 of the Regulations on the Punishment of Traitors, Article 1 of the Temporary Law on Increased Punishment for Criminal Party Members, the preceding paragraph of Article 2, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law, Article 28, Article 64, Paragraph 1, Article 65, Paragraph 1, Article 57, and Article 37, Paragraph 1, judgment is made as in the main text.</p>
<p>This case was executed by Prosecutor Wei Weiqing of this court.</p>

The Hubei Provisional Consultative Council has concluded. The formal Consultative Council will be established after Chairman Wan takes office.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>New Prospects for Sino-French Relations</h3>
<p>In recent days, General Yu An, Chief of the French General Staff, leading the French delegation to China, and Ambassador Merillon and his wife, have flown from the wartime capital to Beiping. After a short stay, they will come south to Nanjing and Shanghai. In Chongqing, General Yu An, in his capacity as a special envoy to China, also presented President Chiang with the French Oak Leaf War Cross on behalf of French President Gouin. As the domestic and international situations become increasingly serious, we must not ignore these activities aimed at strengthening Sino-French relations. Originally, since Ambassador Merillon took office and the new Sino-French agreements were signed, relations between China and France have been built on a new cornerstone, characterized by equality, trust, and love. All past unpleasant shadows have vanished with the new agreements; and at this time, after the new Sino-French agreements, the French government has specially sent a figure like General Yu An to visit China. We fully understand the efforts of the French government to enhance Sino-French relations.</p>
<p>Both China and France have suffered equally significant and profound wounds in this war against the Axis powers and against aggression. China resisted the violent Japanese for the longest time, and vast areas were once occupied by the enemy. Thanks to the wise leadership of our Chairman Chiang, the enemy finally knelt and surrendered. Similarly, a group of French patriots, unwilling to accept enemy puppet rule, either actively participated in the anti-Axis war overseas under General de Gaulle's banner, or launched a large-scale anti-Nazi campaign in the country to uphold and promote the national integrity of France. In World War II, China and France had each made their best efforts and earned a glorious position. The past friendship between China and France has always been close, although there have been some unpleasant events, such as the recent "Pei Er Ding" (Paulding) incident. However, due to the French side's sincerity in resolving the incident, and the traditional spirit of loyalty and forbearance of the Chinese government and people, not wanting to escalate the situation, a peaceful resolution was quickly reached. China has no territorial ambitions in Southeast Asia, as our Chairman Chiang has long declared to the world. In the past, due to the Allied war effort, the Japanese surrendered, and we sent troops to northern Vietnam to handle the surrender and takeover of Japanese troops. This time, with the new Sino-French agreements, we will transfer northern Vietnam to the French military for defense, which shows that China has absolutely no political ambitions in Vietnam. All of this is sufficient to demonstrate the traditional friendship between China and France.</p>
<p>Today, although World War II has ended, to be honest, the international situation still seems to require our joint efforts to maintain world peace. Mankind has not yet awakened and freed itself from the suffering of war, and some people still vainly hope to dominate the world with hegemonic tactics. In this post-war world, China and France are in the same position. Just look at Eastern Europe, from Finland, Poland, Romania all the way to the Mediterranean, which was once an appendage of the Nazis. Is it not now becoming a new bulwark? Germany and Italy have been defeated. Is not France the only strong fortress of Western civilization and democracy left on the entire European continent, apart from the vast country of the Soviet Union? France, therefore, bears a more important mission in today's Europe. How to prevent the entire Europe from being destroyed by power politics is the responsibility of every citizen of the Fourth Republic. Every Frenchman has a duty to continue to promote the glorious tradition of the French Revolution. In today's rampant collectivism, Frenchmen, in particular, have the mission to rise up and defend "Liberty," "Equality," and "Fraternity." The situation is similar in China. Many of the Three Principles of the People of the revolution were influenced by the French Revolution. China and France have somewhat similar national ideals and share the same mission of defending "Liberty," "Equality," and "Fraternity" in this post-war world. In this situation, China and France need to join hands more closely to maintain lasting world peace.</p>
<p>The interests of China and France are the same. In the current turbulent international situation, China and France are in the same position. Having suffered great pain and deep wounds, only China and France need a stable international order to engage in post-war reconstruction. As mentioned above, we have no territorial ambitions, but we are closely concerned about the welfare of Vietnam, which is a brotherly nation to us, and we are deeply attached to them like siblings. We do not need to point out the past relationship between China and Vietnam. However, we must appeal for the future of the Vietnamese people. The colonial policies that France pursued in Vietnam in the past have indeed left regrettable marks on France's glory. We only need to look at the situation in other colonies in Southeast Asia to know how undesirable France's rule in Vietnam was. This war was not fought to maintain colonial empires, and the post-war world is not simply a return to the old ways. France should do its best to realize the national aspirations of the Vietnamese people. It may not be permissible to talk about independence now because of the circumstances, but in any case, the Vietnamese people's desire for autonomy should be satisfied as much as possible. This is also something that France itself should do. Even Britain knows to change its policy towards India, let alone the French who love "Liberty," "Equality," and "Fraternity," who should have no reason to discriminate against the Vietnamese people. Because General Yu An will visit Vietnam after his visit to China, we will briefly state our feelings about the situation in Vietnam.</p>
<p>China's nation-building emphasizes benevolence, righteousness, trustworthiness, and peace. We express our sincere welcome to General Yu An's visit to China. We wish General Yu An a safe journey and that Sino-French relations will become increasingly close!</p>

Xingang was then lost. In this battle, the Communist troops suffered 2,000 casualties. Including the National Army and local people, the total casualties were over 6,000. Houses were destroyed by gunfire and arson by the Communist troops. Only a few broken tiles and remnants remain. The Communist troops, resenting the people's welcome of the National Army, looted everywhere after the National Army withdrew.

<h3>The Hitherto Cabinet Resigns after Half a Year of No Achievements. The Three-Party Association Forms a Coalition Government. The Japanese Emperor Scheduled to Greet MacArthur for the Second Time This Morning</h3>
<p>[Our Tokyo Correspondent, 22nd Dispatch] According to reliable news from the Japanese Imperial Household: Emperor Hirohito of Japan will visit MacArthur at the US Embassy at 11 o'clock tomorrow morning. This will be the Emperor's second visit to MacArthur, the first being on September 24th of last year. It is heard that the Emperor will discuss the situation after the resignation of the Shidehara Cabinet with MacArthur. Following the recent election, Japanese newspapers and political parties (except the Progressive Party) have unanimously attacked Shidehara, which has made the fall of the Shidehara Cabinet inevitable.</p>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 22nd] Japanese Prime Minister Shidehara presented his cabinet's resignation to the Emperor at 5:30 PM (Tokyo time) today. Emperor Hirohito has accepted the resignation of the Shidehara Cabinet, but according to convention, he has ordered Shidehara to remain temporarily in office until a new cabinet is formed. In the six months since the establishment of the Shidehara Cabinet, it has been under constant attack for failing to solve the food and other livelihood issues of the people. In addition, there has been growing dissatisfaction with the Shidehara Cabinet's "lack of achievements," which is likely the main reason for the resignation. According to well-informed sources, the Emperor will not interfere in the selection of the new Prime Minister. It is expected that Shidehara will consult with Jiyuto party (Liberal) leader Hatoyama and Socialist Party leader Katayama, in his capacity as leader of the Progressive Party, but only after obtaining the consent of Hatoyama and Katayama. Most people believe that Shidehara may agree to form a coalition cabinet. It is generally speculated that the Jiyuto party will occupy four seats in the new cabinet, and the Progressive Party and the Socialist Party will each occupy three seats. However, Hatoyama is still under investigation by MacArthur's headquarters and the Japanese government due to suspicions of extreme nationalism. Therefore, many believe that the occupying authorities will not allow him to serve as the leader of Japan.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Tokyo, 22nd] Less than two weeks after the Japanese general election, the Shidehara Cabinet formally announced its resignation at 6:30 PM tonight. Chief Cabinet Secretary Kōtarō Narakashi read a statement to the press, stating: The Cabinet has resigned to help stabilize the political situation and to solve the important problems facing the country. The statement pointed out that the Cabinet has completed its task in conducting fair and impartial elections. The Cabinet respects the establishment of a democratic government based on public opinion. As for the reason for resigning immediately after the election, it is because the situation at the time was complex, and no political party had obtained more than one-third of the seats in the parliament.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 22nd Dispatch] It is generally speculated that Shidehara may nominate Yukio Ozaki as his successor, but it is believed that this 88-year-old politician may not be able to handle the job due to his physical strength. Under the current circumstances, who serves as Prime Minister is not important. What is important is that certain measures must be implemented to ensure stable cooperation among the recently elected political parties.</p>

<h3>MacArthur Orders Japan to Report on Property Seized in Wars of Aggression and Forbids Movement or Transfer. The American People Support the Purge Program</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 21st] The Civilian Property Custody Committee today ordered the Japanese government to notify the entire country to list all the property looted in the occupied areas in the past nine years and submit it to the United Nations Command before June 1st. All property must be properly kept and not transferred or moved in any way, or else punishment will be imposed. The report must list the property items, the names of the owners, the circumstances of the disposition after reaching Japan, and the current nominal holders and locations.</p>
<p>[United Press, San Francisco, 21st] The San Francisco Chronicle editorialized today that the American people will support MacArthur's decision to automatically carry out his political purge program in Japan, even though the Soviet representative on the Allied Council for Japan opposes it. The relationship between the Allied Council for Japan and MacArthur is like that of a cabinet to the US President. MacArthur's rank as Supreme Commander of the United Nations and the special powers granted to him as a soldier are unprecedented. The United Nations Committee is an advisory body and can make suggestions to MacArthur regarding the conduct of the program, which is valuable. However, neither the committee nor any of its representatives has the right to tell MacArthur what to do or what not to do. MacArthur's ability to respect this relationship is extremely fair, and he can continue to implement his sound and firm policies in Japan.</p>
<h3>The Japanese Use Soybeans to Propel Warships and Aircraft</h3>

The teacher told his students, "I would rather be hanged than give up my imperialist and militarist ideas. So-called democracy is just to destroy Japan by surrender or starvation."</p>
<h3>A New Shangri-La Discovered on Sakhalin Island, south of Nanjing. The "Lost Island" Russians Know Nothing of the Last Half-Century.</h3>

The success or failure of the Paris Foreign Ministers' meeting will depend on whether Molotov brings new proposals and whether he has a flexible deadline.</p>

<h3>Eastern Mausoleums Excavation and Robbery Case; More Than Sixty Suspects Arrested</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Peiping, 21st] The Qing Dynasty Eastern Mausoleums suffered large-scale, planned tomb robberies in early December of last year. The mausoleums of Tongzhi, Kangxi, and Xianfeng were robbed of more than one hundred catties of gold, and more than fifty censers of precious jewels (measured by weighing the censers). Notable items stolen include a jade seal of Tongzhi, a gold watch, a nine-dragon jade cup, a white jade horse, a jade seal of Kangxi, a pair of jade lions, a jewel-encrusted gold pagoda, a jade seal of Xianfeng, dragon robes, jade belts, bedding, pillows, and soft films [paintings/calligraphy] loaded onto several large carts.

<h3>British Labour Party Chairman Laski's Talk; New American-Made Atomic Bomb; Terrifying Power; One Can Destroy Two Major American States; The American Side Believes This is Absurd</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Brighton, England, 21st] British Labour Party Chairman Professor Laski said at a meeting today that the new American-made atomic bomb is more powerful than the one dropped in Japan. One bomb can destroy the two major states of Indiana and Illinois, and five bombs can destroy all of America south of the Mason-Dixon Line. Professor Laski criticized the policy of keeping the development of atomic energy secret, calling it an "attack on human security." It is said: "I hope that we will mobilize all our forces to end the illegal application of this secret policy. This policy threatens to poison every channel of our international relations." When Laski was at home tonight, someone asked about the source of his knowledge of the atomic bomb. He refused to answer and only said that it came from "Americans." He learned of this new bomb during a recent visit to the United States.</p>
<p>[United Press International, Washington, 21st] Atomic bomb experts here expressed dissatisfaction with Professor Laski's remarks. Although Professor Laski's opposition to keeping the development of atomic energy secret is roughly similar to what some American scientists advocate, it cannot gain much official sympathy. People familiar with atomic bombs were surprised by the destructive power of the atomic bomb as described by Laski. As far as is known, the atomic bomb made according to the Manhattan Diagram has not changed much in style compared to the one used to bomb Nagasaki. Some scientists estimate that the effectiveness of this bomb is about 25% more effective than the one that bombed Hiroshima. The official announcement is that the strength of this bomb is equivalent to 20,000 tons of explosives. However, when the efficiency reaches 20,000 times, the actual destructive effect is much lower, or equivalent to 100 to 300 times. Based on this deduction, the current experimental work is more focused on improving the performance of existing bombs than on manufacturing giant bombs with a large bombing range. At the same time, Senator Hart, a member of the Senate's Special Committee on Atomic Energy, also criticized: I deeply feel that Mr. Laski actually knows nothing about what he said. Even if he knows something, I cannot agree to disclose it.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 22nd] Captain Qi Xiaer, the official observer at the scene when American planes bombed Nagasaki with atomic bombs, issued a statement today, pointing out that Laski's remarks about atomic bombs were completely inaccurate. Lai (Laski) said that the United States now has atomic bombs with extremely high strength, each of which can destroy all of Indiana and Illinois after it explodes, or an area larger than the total area of ​​England, Scotland, and Wales. Captain Qi said: Without continued inventions in the next few years, the radius of the destruction circle of the atomic bomb is only a few miles.</p>

<h3>Five Japanese War Criminals Hanged; Cried Out Loudly Before Execution; Feet Tied, Eyes Blindfolded; Dead Instantly Upon Hanging; Bodies Cremated and Ashes Delivered to War Criminal Liaison Officer</h3>
<p>[Our Own Dispatch] Former Chief of Staff of the 34th Army of the Japanese War Criminals, Major General Kaburaki Masao, Warrant Officer Fujii Tsutomu, Chief of the General Affairs Section of the Military Police Branch, Sergeant Major Masui Sozo, Private First Class Shirakawa Yosaburo, and Sergeant Major Matsui Koichi, an official of the Military Police Headquarters, were hanged by the American authorities yesterday morning in Wald Road Prison.</p>
<p>They were the masterminds behind the killing of an American pilot. After the pilot was captured by the Japanese army in a bombing raid over Hankow, the Japanese army subjected him to severe torture, forced him to parade through the streets, and then strangled him with ropes that night at the crematorium. One of them was not completely dead after being strangled. The Japanese army tightened the rope to kill him. Its methods were extremely vicious and inhumane. Therefore, when the American military court finalized the case in March, it sentenced the five principals to hanging.</p>
<p>The small room where the execution was carried out was heavily guarded. Except for the executors and witnesses, outside participation was strictly prohibited. The five war criminals were led out of the prison by American military police in order of military rank. Kaburaki Masao was the first to be hanged at 8:17. The other four were executed in the same way one by one. After each hanging, there was a short pause of several minutes. Masui, who had studied at a church school, was baptized by Spanish priest Jiang Chaila before entering the execution chamber.</p>
<p>After each war criminal left the prison, they were first taken to a nearby room where military police tied their hands behind their backs, and then walked into the execution chamber. Then, Captain Ham, the translator of the interrogation committee, read out the charges and judgments to each person. Captain Ham asked the prisoners if they had any last words, and all four shook their heads in silence. But Masui asked that his will be changed from April 20th to April 22nd. Then the four criminals successively had brief conversations with the local monk Kamba. Masui had one with Father Jiang. Then they stepped onto the gallows, and Lieutenant Basak, the former personal guard of General Eisenhower and the current warden of the 701st Military Police Prison of the United States, presided over the execution. The feet of each criminal were tightly tied, their eyes were blindfolded, and the neckbands were adjusted. Then the mechanism was activated, and each criminal died instantly. After the execution, Captain Li Queci, a medical officer, checked to make sure they were dead, and then wrapped the bodies in sheets and placed them in wooden coffins. Before the execution, each criminal requested cremation after death. The ashes and personal belongings of each were handed over to Colonel Matsushita, the current liaison officer of the 6th Japanese Army in Shanghai.</p>
<p>In addition to Lieutenant Ba, there were four others from the American military authorities who performed the execution, including Sergeant Major Ben. Those who testified on the scene included Lieutenant Colonel Weisman, Lieutenant Gira, and Lieutenant Colonel Cade, the head of the US military news liaison team. It is said that the five war criminals did not have deep expressions when they were sentenced, but according to the guards and military police, the prisoners had been crying out loudly in the prison.</p>
<h3>Civilian Indoor DDT; Mosquitoes and Flies Eliminated in Eight Seconds</h3>

<h3>Robbery Followed by Fire: Significant Losses at Shanghai High School. Silver Chests Opened and Cash Stolen, Students' and Teachers' Property Lost. More Than Ten School Buildings Destroyed by Fire, Estimated Value of 40 Million Yuan.</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] The Provincial Shanghai High School in Wujiagang, South Shanghai, is vast. Around 12:00 AM on the 18th, more than ten bandits, including two armed with guns, broke into the administration office downstairs from the north side, near the lead wire silk shop. Inside were three silver chests. The bandits forced the tea boy to hand over the keys to the silver chests, but he refused. They tied him to a tree and stuffed his mouth with cotton wool. Then, they managed to open a safe on the west side, stealing 385,000 yuan in legal tender. The middle chest remained untouched (containing no valuables), while the one on the east side was eventually carried away by the bandits. The losses are said to be heavy.</p>
<p>Teachers Injured in Attacks</p>
<p>At the same time, several teachers who refused to hand over the keys were beaten and injured. As a result, all students' suitcases, clothing, private gold rings, and other valuables were stolen without exception, totaling over 7 million yuan. The robbery lasted for two hours before the bandits left through the front gate. It is reported that heavy foreign chests and other items were loaded onto a truck. Before leaving, they fired three shots into the air as a show of force. It was not until 6:00 AM that the Changqiao police station was notified, which then reported to the Longhua Branch Bureau. He Quan, the director of the branch bureau, along with Wang, the chief of the criminal investigation section, went to the countryside to investigate and reported the robbery to the Municipal Police Bureau for record. They also ordered the detectives to investigate and arrest the perpetrators.</p>
<p>Fire at Midnight: Beyond Control</p>
<p>Unfortunately, misfortune never comes singly. In addition to the Longmen dormitory, the school also had the Zhi, Ren, and Yong dormitories. The Yong dormitory was divided into east and west rooms. Unexpectedly, around 11:30 PM on the night before last (the 21st), a fire suddenly broke out in the toilet on the right side due to an electrical fault. It was late at night, and there were no fire-fighting facilities. All the buildings in that area were bungalows built by the Japanese during the enemy-puppet period (where Japanese troops had been stationed for a long time). Because they were all wooden structures with lead sheet roofs, the fire spread quickly. In an instant, more than ten bungalows in the east and west rooms of the Yong dormitory were completely destroyed. It was not until after 3:00 AM the next morning that the fire extinguished itself. The estimated loss is over 40 million yuan. Fortunately, there were no casualties.</p>

<h3>Women Participate in the Election: Truly an Opportunity to Enjoy Rights and Fulfill Obligations. Zhu Su'e Says It's Not About Competing with Men... Hopes for More Representatives to Speak for Women.</h3>
<p>— ·Our Newspaper Reporter Mai Tian·</p>
<p>The election of city councilors on the 28th is fast approaching? In the past few days, at least several hundred candidates have temporarily set aside their official duties.</p>
<p>Being busy with activities on all fronts, in China, which is striving to embark on the path of democratic politics, this phenomenon should be worthy of joy. In particular, women's participation in the election should not only be supported by the women's community but also by the people of the whole country. If they remember Sun Yat-sen's teachings of "equal rights for men and women," they should truly realize a democratic country and encourage their female compatriots to open up a broad avenue.</p>
<p>The female candidates in this city include Zhu Su'e, a resident member of the Shanghai Provisional Assembly in the Fifth District, Fang Yingda, an officer of the Women's Movement Committee of the Kuomintang Party Headquarters in Huangpu District, Ling Qishen, an officer of the Women's Movement Committee of the Kuomintang Party Headquarters in Changshu District, Tian Shujun, Lu Huimin, a senator of the Provisional Assembly in the Jiangning District, Xie Neng, Zhang Yinggu, Yang Minghui from the education sector, and more than ten others who are representatives of their professions.</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, a reporter visited Zhu Su'e, a lawyer and one of the most enthusiastic members of the women's movement. Ms. Zhu previously served as a Shanghai representative to the First National Women's Congress, worked underground during the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, and currently serves as a member of the Women's Movement Committee, a standing director of the Shanghai Women's Association, and an executive member of the Lawyers' Union. She said: "Women must achieve economic independence and open up real professional doors to truly achieve equal status between men and women. Otherwise, chanting rights, prohibiting this, and abolishing that are all in vain. Women are not willing to degenerate, they are also doing it for a living!" "Women should serve as senators," she continued, "not based on personal viewpoints, but must strive to seek welfare for the public and truly serve all female compatriots." She feels that in China today, not only men but also women themselves understand the importance of women's status. Therefore, she hopes that more female senators will be elected this time, not to compete with men, but to have more representatives to speak for women in the future.</p>
<p>There will be 181 senators elected in Shanghai. According to the city's population of over 3.3 million, women account for over 1.5 million, and men account for over 1.8 million, which is almost half. If one-tenth of the 181 senators are women, that is not too much! If female compatriots are unwilling to succumb to the power of men again, this is truly a great opportunity to enjoy rights and fulfill obligations. You cannot enter without rushing in!</p>
<p>Senate Candidates Deliver Campaign Speeches</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] Chen Gongda, secretary of the Municipal Bureau of Public Works, is enthusiastic about social welfare and has now resigned from his position in the municipal government to participate in the public office election in the Xincheng District. Mr. Chen has served as an engineer in the Shanghai Municipal Council, a section chief and secretary of the Municipal Kuomintang Party Headquarters, and is currently the general manager of the Huada Engineering Firm. Mr. Chen hosted reporters from various newspapers at the municipal government cafeteria yesterday afternoon and expressed his views on municipal affairs. He said that the price of goods in the city is rising endlessly, and people's livelihoods are difficult. In the future, materials should be distributed to households according to the number of people, and food should be rationed accordingly. Rent increases are also unreasonable, and residents are actually producing a part for the landlords. Labor-capital disputes must be regulated in a certain way. If this continues, society will never be stable. In terms of education, funding should be increased, and private schools should also be equally subsidized. Enemy-puppet transportation vehicles, milk sheds, etc., should be organized immediately, otherwise the losses will be huge, which is a pity.</p>
<p>Ying Shiwen, a candidate for senator in the Eighth District (Xujiahui District), is a director of the Youth League Supervision and the Scout Council. Yesterday, he gave a campaign speech on the National Radio Station.</p>

Gu Yousheng was accused of serving as a secret agent for the enemy's New World Gendarmerie, framing underground workers. The accusers Lu Jinyuan and Sun Dianliang came to court to present the details. The defendant denied the charges. The case was postponed for further questioning.</p>
<p>In addition, two cases were opened for trial and the debate was concluded by the collegiate panel: (1) Dong Zhongming, the puppet township head of Zifentownship, First District, Shanghai County, was accused of collecting and procuring food rice for the enemy, and assigning civilian labor.

<p>[Our Newspaper Report] According to Mr. Bao Kehong, a specialist committee member of the Taiwan Provincial Administrative Office, he told reporters: Recently, various sectors often do not understand the facts regarding the administration of grain, industry, mining, and trade in Taiwan Province. A separate explanation is provided below: The grain production in Taiwan Province has decreased sharply because the farmland has not been fertilized for three years, so there is a shortage of grain. The Administrative Office once tried to implement grain rationing, but it ended in failure due to opposition from various sectors. Currently, the Tainan area is demanding rationing, while Taipei is opposing it. Therefore, the Administrative Office will temporarily implement the grain administration according to the needs of various regions. There is no so-called forced rationing system implemented. Regarding the industrial and mining enterprises in Taiwan Province, the Administrative Office abandoned the sealing policy and adopted the supervision method. Therefore, the various important industrial and mining enterprises can still continue to operate without interruption, and they have now entered the takeover stage. Most of the original Japanese technicians will be sent back to their country before the end of April, except for those who have been specially approved by MacArthur to remain. Currently, the Administrative Office's Shanghai Liaison Office is rushing to send a large number of takeover personnel to Taiwan in batches to complete the takeover work. In terms of trade, various sectors often criticize the control. It is said that in fact, any merchant who ships any goods to Taiwan Province will not be obstructed by the Administrative Office except for those prohibited by customs. The only obstacle currently felt is the restriction of shipping tonnage. The only item restricted for export from Taiwan Province is grain, which is to prevent the grain situation in Taiwan Province from becoming increasingly serious. The export of Taiwan sugar is based on the principle of exchanging for fertilizer, otherwise, the fertilizer for producing Taiwan sugar in the next two years will be impossible to solve. As for the coal in Keelung, it is supplied to the Fuel Management Committee of the Executive Yuan for unified allocation. Other items such as camphor, tobacco, and alcohol have always been monopolies in Taiwan Province, so it is intended to protect trade, and there is no so-called control. It is also reported that since November last year, the Administrative Office's Shanghai Liaison Office has sent nearly 3,000 public officials to Taiwan in batches, and is still continuing to send them.</p>

<h3>The World's Metropolis Reveals a New Look! A Stroll Through New York in Early Spring</h3>
<p>— A Dispatch from Our Correspondent in New York, Zhu Jiarang</p>
<p>Here, spring doesn't officially begin until March 21st. Although the cold wind from the river sometimes still bothers us, the time is different after all, and spring has finally arrived! The sun shines high for days, illuminating the earth, and the shoots of green in Central Park are also full of life. People are gradually emerging from the stifling atmosphere and embracing nature. This world-class metropolis is once again dressed up.</p>
<p>Like an overture to spring, the New York International Flower Show opened in the Central Building, symbolizing the arrival of spring. According to the newspapers, this flower show had been suspended for four years due to the war. This year, it is making a comeback and raising its banner again, so all those involved in horticulture are competing to show off their skills, exhibiting their best plants for public viewing.</p>
<p>It is difficult to describe this grand and impressive exhibition. One point, however, can be made: their efforts are not only comprehensive and colorful, containing the meaning of a comprehensive exposition, but also seem to emphasize horticulture and practical applications. The exhibition occupies three floors of the building. Some displays use gardens as backdrops, others are decorated with home furnishings; some are large-scale, others are small displays, each in its place, each with its own charm. Here, they also tell you how to plant flowers, how to care for flowers. When a bunch of red roses is delivered to your door in a cardboard box, how should you handle it to maintain its beautiful life for a week or ten days? How can you insert various kinds and colors of fresh flowers into vases of different diameters and shapes to make them graceful, charming, and full of laughter? There are experts who have studied every aspect in detail. From the perspective of those of us who still struggle to make ends meet, they are truly engaging in "gilding the lily."</p>
<p>If New York can represent the United States, seeing New York is equivalent to seeing the entire United States. In fact, their life and society do have many similarities and differences with ours. They certainly owe their current status to industrialization, which has raised the general standard of living many times higher than that of other countries, and their vitality and social customs also have their unique aspects. Occasionally strolling through the streets, looking and listening, and then closing your eyes to think, even if you don't have a set of "mixed feelings," you can still express yourself freely.</p>
<p>First of all, we cannot deny that the United States is a capitalist country, where the authority of money is everywhere apparent, and the evils of capitalism are inevitable. But sometimes, when you think about it, their current situation also has its social logic. The so-called capitalism is originally rooted in free competition and the private ownership system. If private ownership is allowed, then there must be free competition. Without competition, how can there be private ownership? At the same time, because everyone can compete, everyone can obtain private ownership. This principle of relying on one's own strength to win fairly has promoted Western civilization and laid a solid foundation for wealth and strength. This is the good side. On the side of abuses, according to some, it inevitably leads to the emergence of hegemony, and most people will have no food to eat, but this phenomenon is not seen here. They believe that the harm of this kind of practice is not as bad as some propagandists say. While capitalists certainly concentrate wealth, the government's implementation of heavy tax policies can restrain them, and religious leaders, educators, the Red Cross, and public opinion often cause wealthy people to generously open their wallets, disgorging large sums of money to establish social undertakings and even send them overseas. Furthermore, the lives of the general public, although a large portion rely on wages, generally have relatively high incomes, and prices can be stabilized. In particular, their highest philosophy is production. As long as they produce more and produce quickly, prices will fall, wages will increase, and of course, life will be better. The stability and prosperity of American society can be said to be developing under this logic.</p>
<p>We don't need to make any praise or criticism of this kind of social ideology here, only look at one thing in practice that is noteworthy, that is, the eight characters "Make the best use of everything, make the best use of everyone" (物盡其用，人盡其才) have unexpectedly been realized here first. They have truly achieved the ideal of "benefiting the people by utilizing resources" (利用厚生). Everything is used to its fullest extent, not only to avoid the slightest "waste of goods on the ground," but also to exhaust its performance, making full use of it, so that everything in the universe is used by people, and not a single piece of wood or stone is wasted. On the other hand, to be a person, one must truly be a person, not something that resembles a person but isn't. Life in this world is about using things, not about being used by others. Everyone is a person, and should have human dignity and not be used by others. Based on this reasoning, we can see three social phenomena: First, material resources are therefore particularly abundant, ubiquitous, and dazzling, changing with each passing day, and human enjoyment is rapidly reaching its peak. Second, the social system encourages research and rewards success. People's competition is directed toward a broad and generous nature, there are more opportunities to stand out, and everyone can become "talented." Third, because of strong productivity, everyone is well-fed and clothed, the minimum standard of living is guaranteed, they can stand up straight, the opportunity to bow to others is reduced, the concept of equality is increased, and personality is universally improved, so everyone can become a "talented" "person." Finally, because everything is used to its fullest extent, and everyone has something to use, there is no need to use people. Therefore, apart from barbers and shoeshiners, whose services are relatively indispensable, the rest are obviously being reduced. Not to mention household servants, even waiters in restaurants, bars, and teahouses sometimes face a "manpower shortage." Many shops often have "help wanted" signs posted in their windows. Occupational changes in an industrialized society are of course a normal phenomenon, shifting from directly serving people to social egalitarianism. Isn't this another explanation of raising people's character?</p>
<p>But the key point remains one. Everyone must first make the country rich, everyone must have food to eat, everyone can hold their heads high, and only then can everyone be considered a person. It must be stated here that whether this kind of practice can achieve thorough equality, as socialism says, is still unknown; but it is clear that further production makes human society take a big step, this principle is common, and it is also beyond doubt.</p>
<p>Earning Money First, Enjoying Life Above All Else</p>
<p>Based on the above social structure, extrapolating another picture, I think they are really about "earning money first, enjoying life above all else." Earning money is the foundation of life, the way to obtain bread. In their capitalist society, everything is calculated in terms of money, so money can fully represent human happiness. People want to live, people want to be extravagant, the only thing they need is money, so everyone wants to earn money, everyone uses all means to get money. Moreover, the minimum wage for workers is regulated, and there is no limit to the maximum compensation, so as long as you are willing, as long as you have the ability, you can earn as much money as possible. At the same time, material enjoyment is increasing, and you have to earn money actively enough to keep pace with the times and the desires of mankind. Therefore, the enthusiasm for earning money is indeed a cut above the rest.</p>
<p>Open the newspaper or sit on the subway, and everywhere you look, there are eye-catching advertisements. The design of the advertisements exhausts the abilities of advertising, needless to say, the main reason is nothing more than wanting to do more business and earn more money. Although several large companies are closed on Sundays as usual, they are still open on Saturday afternoons, and every week there are two or one days when business hours are extended to 9:00 PM. Other ordinary stores are even more unrestricted, especially those called drug stores (Drugs), which are actually general stores, they simply have to be open until midnight every day (restaurants and entertainment venues are no exception), with no weekly holidays, just like our ordinary stores. This is very different from the strict restrictions in England, where stores close at 5:30 PM every day, and are closed on Saturday afternoons and Sundays. Furthermore, Americans really know how to do business. When you walk into any store, the clerks all seem to have read salesmanship books. They want you to go in empty-handed and come out with a purchase. You originally wanted to buy one item, but in the end, they "convince" you to buy two or three. This is certainly a universal phenomenon of business acumen, but their interest in making money is naturally more intense.</p>
<p>The question after earning money is how to use it, which is the purpose of earning money, and Americans seem to understand this very well. Therefore, generally speaking, in addition to necessary savings, they try to use money as much as possible, to seek as much satisfaction in life as possible, and to strive for enjoyment and fun as much as possible, to make up for work and not waste a lifetime. They believe that this can also accelerate the circulation of money and promote social prosperity, so consumption, extravagance, and general enjoyment have developed accordingly. In particular, this city of New York is a dazzling world, nothing more than a place of consumption, and no matter how much money you have to eat and use, you cannot fill the desires of people. The brightly lit and clean restaurants are crowded everywhere, orange juice and milk gushing like springs, fish, meat, rice, and noodles are available on demand. People are constantly eating and drinking there from morning to night, without any "market open" or "market close" times. Here, in a broad sense, in addition to eating and drinking (recently, due to price controls, some items such as butter are in short supply, and food may be reduced soon to relieve Europe and Asia), clothing is slightly lacking due to price controls, and general industrial production of daily necessities is even more insufficient due to labor strikes (such as automobiles, radios, electric refrigerators, etc.). It is currently slightly suppressed, but in reality, their areas of seeking pleasure have not diminished. The entertainment venues on Broadway are packed every day, and people line up in double rows to buy tickets. Rockefeller Center has a huge theater called Radio City Music Hall. In addition to movies, there are also songs and dances. Its magnificent architecture and luxurious decoration are probably second to none. Every morning, a large group of men and women wait in line to buy tickets. The entire theater has about 20,000 seats, and people still have to wait for half an hour at a time to get in. As for nightclubs, bars, and dance halls, the city is open all night, which is even more imaginable.</p>
<p>Another thing that can be mentioned here is that they seek pleasure and work together, using pleasure to increase work efficiency. Therefore, whenever they have free time, they all look for some entertainment to activate their spirits. Americans usually compete in everything they say and do for lightness and humor, to make people laugh, and their principle is to say things that make people happy. Chinese customs like to be polite and formal, which inevitably suppresses emotions and is not amusing, which may also be a difference between Eastern and Western cultures. However, Westerners are accustomed to being unrestrained, always wanting to move towards pleasure and joy, and not caring about small details, which is really expressed very fully. To give another example: In our country's concept, universities should be places for learning, so-called "lofty institutions of learning," but who knows that here, in addition to attending classes, they are also exactly like large hotels. Dining halls, bars, billiard rooms, everything is available. Downstairs in the men's dormitory at Columbia, music echoes every night, dancing late into the night, which really makes old scholars clap their tables in anger; but Columbia's being Columbia has not damaged its reputation in the slightest.</p>
<h3>Seeking Progress in Life, Demanding Reasonableness in Waste</h3>
<p>The United States consumes a lot of materials, and from the perspective of economists, this is naturally very wasteful. To give a few examples: New York's tap water is piped in from mountains hundreds of miles away, which must not be easy to obtain, but the supply is unlimited, and no ordinary user goes to conserve it. According to their own statistics, no one uses less than one hundred gallons of water every day, and the total daily consumption of the entire city is staggering. Electricity is also worthless, with brilliant lights and roaring furnaces everywhere. No ordinary household does not have several electrical appliances, and the landlady will never argue with you about the electricity bill. Also, the use of paper here is quite extravagant. Paper cups and paper towels are scattered everywhere, and any paper utensil becomes a discarded item once it has been used. Like newspapers, there are about ten major ones, and their circulation is very considerable. Taking the New York Times as an example, its Sunday sales recently exceeded one million copies, with as many as eighty to one hundred pages, plus special Sunday supplements, book reviews, and weekly magazines. If you flip through it roughly, it will take you an hour, and the consumption of paper is staggering, which is conceivable. There are countless other examples. Not to mention that from the perspective of those of us who have long been involved in the conservation movement, they are too wasteful, even Americans themselves cannot help but feel that they are sometimes too "squandering the gifts of nature." Especially in the midst of the current world famine, the United States, with its already hungry and drowning heart, must reduce consumption to relieve others. Many political figures and social celebrities in Washington, starting with President Truman, have successively called on the people to reduce consumption and help Europe and Asia. The Post-War Relief Conference held in Atlantic City, and former Director-General Lehman even advocated that the United States resume rationing. Americans enjoy their uniquely blessed resources and inevitably consume too much, which is also a fact.</p>
<p>However, the author is not defending them here. I feel that although they are wasteful, they also have their reasonable principles. In other words, while they waste on one end, they save huge, intangible consumption on the other end. I still sometimes think that they can make good use of materials, using all resources for our use, so since they are already rich, why be stingy? Isn't it foolish to have things and not use them? Therefore, enjoying nature is of course reasonable. Moreover, consumption is aimed at improving human life, health, and culture. A country that has already developed production cannot talk about conservation to block production. On the contrary, it should encourage consumption to share the fruits of production and raise the standard of living. But in reality, aren't they still pursuing rationalization everywhere? Look at the elevators in large buildings, moving like shuttles, with hundreds of male and female drivers. This can be said to be a waste of manpower, but for the sake of the thousands of people who ride the elevators, these drivers are saving them countless time and energy. It is not necessary to use washable towels in public places, but to consume large amounts of paper towels. Isn't this somewhat pointless? However, it is precisely for this reason that infectious diseases are prevented and the consumption of countless public energy and money is saved. Let's talk about drinking water. As a joke, this foreign water is really good to drink. Tap water is a completely safe beverage anyway, wash water for washing your face and drinking water are the same thing. The major companies here are equipped with drinking fountains. If you want to try it, just turn a small key, and a fountain will gush out, cool and delicious, and it won't cost you a penny. Naturally, this kind of water supply project is arduous, but from now on, you will never have to boil water, and hygiene is guaranteed, saving coal, salary, and money, and no one knows how many? Here is another example: In addition to a few public buses that still hire conductors (actually, they only collect money and do not check tickets), all other means of transportation have been abolished. Passengers automatically insert money when they get on the bus. If they insert money, no ticket is given, and only the passenger knows if they don't insert. But maybe their level has reached this point. This saves people and saves paper, and the effect is still quite good. The New York subway also never sells tickets. Passengers simply drop a nickel into the gate and turn around to enter the station. Therefore, there are no ticket sellers, and the paper saved from bus tickets every day is even more staggering. Looking at it this way, they are superficially wasting, but in reality, they are still striving for conservation everywhere. They still don't do unnecessary and unreasonable waste.</p>

<h3>Thank You, Forgive Me: Harmonious Interpersonal Relationships</h3>
<p>In terms of attitude and demeanor, some reveal that Americans are more lively, but lack a bit of solemnity. They shrug their shoulders, wave their hands, and while speaking, their expressions, eyebrows, eyes, and face often move together; most people seem to have naturally become accustomed to it. However, generally speaking, they still pay great attention to politeness and order. Twenty-four hours a day, unless you are alone in your room and not in contact with anyone, you will always receive or send countless "thank yous," "forgive mes," and "I'm sorrys"... If you lightly bump into someone on the road, you're sure to get an "I'm sorry," and they'll say "thank you" for letting them go first. When a waiter brings food to you in a restaurant or teahouse, it is originally his duty, but the diner still has to say "thank you." When a shop assistant takes money after a purchase, they routinely express thanks. Even in the classroom, after a teacher asks a student a question, they say "thank you." Moreover, the number of times thanks are offered is imaginable. The number of times "forgive me" is said is equally numerous: When asking someone for directions, it's essential to start with "please forgive me," otherwise, it's somewhat rude. If you don't hear what someone says clearly and ask them to repeat it, you don't reply with "What?" or emit a heavy "Huh?" from your throat, but rather a genuine "Pardon." In short, when asking a favor of someone, an apology is offered first. When someone provides you with a convenience, regardless of whether it's substantial or minimal, or whether their service stems from enthusiasm or is simply their responsibility, gratitude is expressed without exception. Thus, "thank you" and "forgive me"... have become everyone's catchphrases, the "opening remarks" and "grand finale" of every conversation. Naturally, these phrases, from our Chinese perspective, sometimes seem redundant and excessive, and whether they are spoken sincerely by the general population, and what value they actually have, is also a question; however, in all fairness, we shouldn't be too critical. These habits are sufficient to harmonize interactions and lubricate human contact, and are certainly more than just "the art of speaking."</p>
<p>Moreover, these catchphrases, if considered thoughtfully, are also very reasonable. When a person always holds a grateful heart, knows that others bestow much upon them, and increasingly remembers their own debts to others, and acts in a way that demonstrates "self-restraint," harmonious relationships will be created in society between people as a result of this concept. Speaking of this, I can't help but think of our Confucius, who also had his "Way of Loyalty and Forgiveness." Loyalty means "exhausting oneself," and forgiveness means "extending oneself." It seems that this is slightly different than "thank you" and "forgive me," but in fact, it is very consistent. Only by fearing that one has not "exhausted oneself" are they constantly and sincerely fearful and apologetic, asking for forgiveness. Not having enough "extending oneself," they offer fervent thanks. It shows that the principles of Eastern and Western cultures are only one; even if there are small differences, they are still largely the same. However, there is one point of custom that may also be related to national character, and the habits of Chinese and foreigners are ultimately inconsistent. Easterners, especially the character and interests of us Chinese, tend towards the latent. They always like to suppress and then promote, hide a bit, and are not good at expressing themselves, while Westerners are very different. They have seven points of ability and must express ten. When dealing with people, although they also speak with elegant phrasing, they do not use excessive politeness, so as not to dampen the atmosphere and make it difficult to become close. Therefore, Chinese people who initially set foot in foreign lands often cannot fully adapt when interacting with foreigners. Here are a few small examples: If someone praises you for speaking English well, we usually deny it outright, saying, "Ah no, my English is too bad." Sometimes, when you dance with an American for the first time at a social gathering, according to the majority of customs, you should first declare, "I'm sorry, I can't dance." Little do they know, we consider these words very appropriate and polite, but they often consider them strange. Furthermore, there are things that they find pleasing and delightful, but because we consider them unnatural, we hesitate to say or do them. For example, when inviting someone to dinner, we don't praise our own elaborate dishes; when receiving a gift, we don't open it immediately to show our appreciation and satisfaction. Also, in appropriate situations, we don't publicly praise a female guest's beauty in a timely manner; these things often disappoint people. However, these things are absolutely not customary for us Chinese, because the preconceptions are deeply ingrained. According to the general explanation, wouldn't these words intentionally be trying to make people happy?</p>
<p>Spiritual Life Is Still Not Neglected</p>
<p>America's material life can be considered to have reached its peak. Especially in this world's number one city, paper drunk and gold obsessed, globally unmatched, its more than seven million residents are constantly exposed to the temptations of sights, sounds, and colors, and the pursuit of material things, the degree of its frenzy need not be said. But in this environment where money is omnipotent and material things are prosperous, strangely, they still pay attention to spiritual life, they still pursue religious comfort. After material satisfaction is achieved, they do not forget the spirit. Even with material life, they do not look down on spiritual life, and this point is closely related to the maintenance and development of their country and society.</p>
<p>In this country, the religions are Catholicism and Christianity. Although the two have some differences, they both have the same Old and New Testaments. So generally speaking, their beliefs are still the same. I say that the religious atmosphere here is strong. First, you can see the number of churches. I am afraid that there is no place other than Rome that can compare to it, and its magnificent architecture is also not easy to see in many places. The distribution of churches is very common. Whether you are in the bustling Wall Street or Fifth Avenue, they stand tall everywhere. Some of the buildings have new colors, while others are completely charred black. Second, the number of churchgoers is large, and they are full everywhere on Sundays. Many churches hold two services, morning and evening, and St. Peter's Cathedral often divides into groups, with one group going in and one group coming out, which is very busy. All the churches are open all day on weekdays so that pedestrians can enter and pray, and in some places, there are morning and evening services every day, without sermons, only singing hymns and prayers, and male and female church members are also very crowded. In addition, in the religious atmosphere of society, such as radio broadcasts, newspaper reports, and speeches and announcements by celebrities and politicians, there is always some religious meaning, in various forms, indicating that Americans have religious beliefs and are in awe of God.</p>
<p>But if you ask these religions, what strong organization do they actually have? After asking many people, they all say they are very free and scattered. Except for Catholicism, Christianity is not subordinate to the Pope of Rome, and it is not fundamentally related to the federal government in any way. According to the Church Yearbook of 1945, there are a total of 253,762 Christian churches in the golden country, with 72,492,669 church members. (In 1936, there were only 190,000 churches and 50 million church members). But the number of Catholics is probably even greater. Of course, these people may not all be devout at ordinary times, but most of them pay donations and fulfill their obligations. The church expenses here are divided into recurring expenses and overseas mission expenses, and the annual figures are not small, all borne by church members separately. Therefore, some large churches have sufficient finances and pastors receive huge salaries. Most churches have Chinese missionary organizations, and regularly send people to preach in China. Their work areas and the allocation of funds are planned separately in China.</p>
<p>Now let us ask again, what role does their religious belief play in their social customs and people's hearts? This question is certainly not easy to answer, because it is ultimately abstract. Especially in large cities like New York, there is a lot of social crime. It is difficult to see a significant negative effect; but according to the comments of most church people and impartial people, if this country had no religious beliefs, then human desires would be even more rampant. Now there is only this social education and training institution, which energizes people every week, polishes them up, raises the torch of morality, and acts as a mainstay. The moral standards of this country are being actively maintained in this way. For example, in terms of social atmosphere, despite the casual relations between men and women, there is still the public opinion supervision of the church. If a person wants to do some business and has moral flaws, this is very tricky. The United States has a national church organization that often publishes opinions and criticizes politics and society. Not long ago, a conference was held, and even the atomic bombing of Hiroshima was criticized. In fact, this religious force is indeed the mainstay of this country's morality. They usually speak out in a completely democratic and free way based on their religious beliefs, leading the masses and influencing people's hearts, and directly influencing the country's policies, which is also of great importance. At this time of worldwide chaos, the United States has not only used its strong material resources to defeat the enemy, but now also wants to have compassion for others, save the famine, and vigorously establish justice. We cannot deny that they mainly benefit from religion for this great moral force.</p>
<h3>Looking Down and Remotely Thinking of the Motherland: Still Too Busy Saving the Dying</h3>
<p>Now, looking at others, I can't help but think of myself. This country has only been established for 170 years, and it has progressed to such an extent that the people are well-fed and well-clothed, which is truly called people's livelihood and happiness; but looking back at the motherland, most of my compatriots are still chewing on grass roots to make a living. How dare this contrast make people look at it squarely? We have a long history and culture that people admire us for. This time, the long-term war of resistance won victory, and the country's status rose to the top five powers, so we certainly have a lot of face; however, if we are not blindly arrogant! But if there is some conscience and feeling, being abroad is really sometimes embarrassing and even unable to hold our heads up.</p>
<p>The news about our country is recorded in great detail in the newspapers here. Especially the telegrams from Chongqing, Shanghai, Changchun and other places are all lengthy. But after saying this and that, there is only one impression, that is, reunification still has obstacles, and the country's fortunes still need to be stabilized. The Soviet Union does not want to withdraw its troops in the Northeast, and the criticism here is unfair, but it is the most undeniable fact that our own country is not strong and there are still problems internally. Especially like some time ago, Washington and some public opinion said that if China is not unified, it will not be able to share the responsibility of world peace, and the title of the top five powers will also have an impact. Obviously, the country has not yet escaped from difficulties, making every citizen less glorious, especially those living abroad, the degree of reflected light is particularly strong. Thinking that their own government is still in a difficult environment and coping hard, the overall situation after the war has not yet embarked on a broad road. The economic panic is no less easy than during the war, and because prices continue to soar, the people have not received the benefits of victory at all. The lives of ordinary people are getting harder and harder, and the famine in the Central Plains is especially tragic. How can this fellow countryman not want to think about it? But how can I bear to think about it?</p>
<p>The fact is very clear, our own progress is still far behind the international achievements in recent years. Although the name belongs to us, the essence has not yet arrived. The content and reputation do not match. Come out and take a look. There are too many countries that are smaller than us, but when it comes to construction and people's lives, we only have a false name and we really can't compare to others. Others have industrial products, but we only have agricultural products. Like Switzerland, a small country, the people of a small country are drilling in a small circle to study and manufacture small machines. Today, watches, musical instruments, and typewriters are famous all over the world. The three countries of Scandinavia in Northern Europe, in terms of international status, can't catch up with our country, but Danes and Swedes eat and use a lot today, and songs are all over the streets. What about us? Although the vast majority of the people have newly won the title of the top five powers, if it is not to reduce our own prestige, we can't help but feel discouraged. Who doesn't regard most Chinese people as poor boys, pitiful human beings in the eyes of foreigners? If you walk into a pharmacy, the shop assistants will very sensitively solicit you to buy vitamins. Once, the author was a little annoyed by him and asked him the reason. He had a sympathetic face and said that many people in China don't have food to eat now, so they need this thing. At that time, I wanted to save face and immediately replied that China produces rice and wheat, and there is a lot of food, but I thought that this kind of pretending to be fat to fill your face is very meaningless. China's poverty is obvious to all, and it is too stupid to hide it like this. What's more, in the pictures on the movies and books, from India to here, how many of the topics related to China are pleasing to the eye? Along the way, there are photo exhibitions that are dotted with the characteristics of various places, and the representatives of China are either "King Wen's divine class" or poor old women or women with bound feet in ragged clothes. The United States is now demobilizing on the one hand, and still recruiting soldiers on the other hand. To recruit soldiers, they have to use various advertising methods to attract strong men. The day before yesterday, an advertisement was published in the newspaper. They actually took the sedan chair in Sichuan as the subject. Several allied soldiers sat on the sedan chair, and the Chinese sedan chair bearers moved forward in a panting sweat, saying that they were enjoying world travel. At the same time, there are some books and periodicals published here that have this situation. Recently, I saw an issue of the magazine that used water buffalo plowing the fields to symbolize China. Although this backward fact is true, I don't understand why it is still emphasized. There are still many beautiful shots of the country. Wouldn't it be better to expose your own weaknesses less?</p>
<p>Finally, a little point: There are not a few of us who live here now. Everyone is on other people's land, wearing other people's clothes, and eating other people's food, but when I think that I am Chinese after all, and I rely entirely on other people's civilization, I only steal a day of peace. When I look at myself again, what I brought from the motherland, I can't help but be ashamed. Of course, although we don't have industrial products, it's not that we don't have good things, but the rivers and mountains are still "broken" and the people are still in dire straits. At the door of post-disaster relief, we are still a group of pitiful people waiting to be fed. Others are "adding flowers to the brocade", and we are still "too busy saving the dying". What can we show in front of others? Even to talk about a small matter, some people who like to collect stamps often ask the Chinese for stamps. It is very common, but they do not know that our stamp numbers are too alarming. In order to avoid disputes, some people have withdrawn their hands. Take this as an example, and the rest can be summarized. In short, we are bad, bad, bad, too bad. We must bow our heads to admit it and reflect deeply. The moon in a foreign country and the moon in China are of course the same; but if one side is a garden pavilion and the other side is always broken walls, the reflected moonlight will be different. It doesn't matter that we have difficulties now. The problem is only whether the whole country, at this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, can not miss the opportunity to turn the world around? Everyone has a share in this responsibility. Complaining is not the solution, but we must all take out our conscience and truly take responsibility.

<h3>The United States and Britain Praise China: Wartime Education Is Flourishing and Developing: Higher Education Has Made Great Progress During Wartime: The Foundation of Education Has Not Been Shaken by the War</h3>
<p>[Atlantic City, American News Service, 21st] Dr. Egloff, Dean of the American Institute of Chemistry, was invited by the Chinese government to China to investigate oil sources for eight days. He recently returned. He praised China's higher education for making great progress despite being devastated by the war.</p>
<p>American Doctor Examines Statistics, April 15th, The Christian Science Monitor published an article mentioning that Egloff had conducted an on-the-spot investigation of China's education situation and obtained statistical data from reliable education circles. The article stated: Dr. Egloff said that since the Japanese army occupied Manchuria in 1931 and launched military operations more than ten times, the number of higher education institutions in China has increased from 108 to 133 by 1940. As far as he knew, there were 33,000 graduates of liberal arts and other subjects in 1931 alone. Although there were only 25,000 graduates in the above-mentioned subjects in 1940, there were also 25,000 graduates in agricultural sciences, which shows that many students have shifted their research objects and diligently studied animal husbandry, keeping "soil" and "fertilizer" and other courses. According to Egloff's observation, the vigorous phenomenon of wartime education is not only limited to universities, but also to lower-level schools.</p>
<p>Britain Attributes It to the Aid to China Fund</p>
<p>[British News Service, London, 22nd] China's most difficult task in peacetime is to build educational institutions, rebuild schools, train teachers, revise textbooks, and educational equipment. Although China has suffered incomparable difficulties in the long war, the foundation of education has not been shaken, and educational institutions have also been retained. This is all thanks to the assistance of the British Aid to China Fund, which is supplemented by education as one of the main purposes of the association's activities. The importance of this assistance can be proved by the letter received by the association from the director of the Chinese Christian Education Association, which said: "The relief of secondary schools is very important, because they will soon enter universities and various specialized schools. We have received many letters of thanks from schools. Without the help of the British Aid to China Fund, some students will not be able to continue their studies." The total amount of the British Aid to China Fund is 1,704,706 pounds.</p>

<h3>Jiangsu Province's Post-War Education: Schools in Jiangnan Have Resumed and Increased: Schools in Jiangbei Are Gradually Recovering</h3>
<p>[Special report from Zhenjiang by this newspaper] Jiangsu Province's educational institutions and schools had 79 units before the war. Since Chen Shi-zhen took over as the Director of the Education Department after the Anti-Japanese War, he has worked hard to restore education. Although a part of the counties in Jiangbei are restricted by the environment, education has not yet restored its old appearance, and considerable progress has been made in possible advancement. At present, there are five units of provincial educational institutions and schools that have been restored and newly established in the province, and the number of schools has increased at the local level. Some secondary schools have more than 2,000 students, so although the number of schools is smaller, the number of students is more than before the war. However, the most difficult problem at present is school buildings. For example, the school buildings of Nanjing Provincial Nanzhong, Provincial Girls' High School, Louxia Township Normal School, Zhenjiang Middle School, and Normal School were quite large in scale before the war, and the vocational school in Hushu Pass and other middle school buildings were mostly razed to the ground, which has a great impact on the current restoration of schools. The situation of all provincial schools and educational institutions that have been restored and newly established in the province, and the situation of schools that will be relocated from the interior, are recorded below.</p>
<p>Higher Education</p>
<p>Jiangsu currently has four provincial colleges and universities: (1) Jiangsu College, which was relocated from Fujian and restored, moved to Xuzhou, (2) Jiangsu Education College, which remained in Wuxi after restoration, (3) Provincial Sericulture College, (4) Provincial Industrial College. The above two colleges were established during the Anti-Japanese War and have now been restored.</p>
<p>Secondary Education</p>
<p>The established "Provincial Middle Schools" include Zhenjiang, Suzhou, Shanghai, Changzhou, Yangzhou, Nantong, Xuzhou, Yancheng, and Huai'an. Yancheng Middle School is temporarily located in Taixian County. Huai'an Middle School is temporarily located in Yangzhou. In addition, Songjiang Girls' Middle School is being planned by Principal Jiang Xue-zhu to repair the school building. After the repair is completed, it will be restored. In addition, the Second Temporary Middle School has not yet moved back in Tunxi. Public Nan Jing Middle School has been restored in Jiangyin. "Normal Schools" include Taihui, Zhenjiang, Wuxi, Ru _, (Rugao Normal School is temporarily located in Taixian County), Xuzhou, (Xuzhou Normal School is newly established), Donghai, Xuzhou Women's Normal School, Suzhou Women's Normal School and other normal schools, and Wujiang Township Normal School, Huangdu Township Normal School, (Huangdu Township Normal School building has been destroyed and classes are now held in Anting) and other ten schools. In addition, the newly established Jiangning Normal School has been temporarily received by Principal Ma Ke-tan to use the former Nanjing Provincial Experimental Primary School building to prepare for the establishment of the school. In addition, a temporary normal school is located in northern Anhui, and will be merged into a provincial normal school within the province after the summer. "Vocational Schools" include Suzhou Industrial, Hushu Pass Sericulture, Yixing Senior Agricultural and Forestry, Songjiang Vocational Middle School, Suzhou Agriculture, Yixing Ceramics, and other six schools. Among them, Songjiang Vocational School is being prepared by Principal Xue Tian-you, and will be fully restored after the summer.</p>
<p>Elementary Education</p>
<p>Provincial Primary Schools include four provincial experimental primary schools in Suzhou, Zhenjiang, Shanghai, and Yangzhou. There are six affiliated primary schools in Wuxi, Taicang, Xuzhou, Donghai, and Xuzhou Women's Normal School, and Wujiang Township Normal School. The remaining experimental primary schools and affiliated primary schools will be restored again after the summer. As of now, according to the statistics of more than 20 counties that have reported their restoration to the Education Department, there are more than 10,000 national schools with more than 300,000 students.</p>
<p>Social Education</p>
<p>There are currently three provincial people's education centers in Zhenjiang, Xuzhou, and Nantong. Zhenjiang and Suzhou libraries, and Nanjing Provincial Guoxue Library. The Provincial Zhenjiang Sports Ground and Jiangsu Education Forest Farm have offices in Jiangpu and Tangshan.</p>
<p>Relocation of National Middle Schools</p>
<p>The province arranged for the relocation of national middle schools in the interior. The National Aquatic School is looking for land along the Yangtze River and the sea, and plans to set it up in Chongming. The National Senior Agricultural School is planned to be located between Jiangyin and Wujin. National Second Middle School. There are more than 300 students from Suzhou and Xinyang who are looking for a school building. If they can find a school building, it would be best. Otherwise, they will be assigned to corresponding provincial schools to continue their studies. National 21st Middle School is looking for a school building in northern Jiangsu. (An)</p>

<h3>Scientific Conferences to Be Held Grandly in London</h3>
<p>[British Embassy, London, 22nd] Two important scientific conferences will be held grandly in London during June and July. One is convened by the Royal Society, and the other includes scientific representatives from various governments of the British Empire. The purpose of the conferences is to strengthen scientific cooperation, reduce duplication of research work, and increase work efficiency. Significant progress has already been made in this cooperation, especially in colonial regions. For example, research on the East African tsetse fly is undertaken by a special committee of the Economic Advisory Committee. The 1939 campaign to prevent rinderpest in Africa was a joint effort. Academic institutions in British colonies enable students scattered in various locations to gather and conduct joint research. The Colonial Development and Welfare Act facilitates closer cooperation in research within the colonial empire. The Colonial Research Committee was established in 1940, with annual research funding reaching 500,000 pounds. The research work of British scientists is mostly directed by British research institutions, but the research institutions of various self-governing dominions have been well organized, and the research groups of various self-governing dominions are extremely supportive of the summer's London scientific conferences.</p>
<h3>Guilin Normal School Petitions: Student Meal Expenses Deficient by More Than Two Million Monthly; Requests Provincial Government to Issue Rice Substitute Funds</h3>
<p>[Dazhong News Agency, Guilin] Due to dietary problems, all students of the Provincial Guilin Normal School sent representatives to Guilin to petition the Standing Committee. According to them, in the past, each student could receive 41.4 catties of unpolished rice in public grain and over one hundred yuan in supplementary food expenses per month, which was enough to maintain life. Starting this year, the government stopped issuing public grain and instead provided a meal allowance of 4,000 yuan per student per month, including supplementary food expenses. At the current grain price, this is only enough to last for ten days. The total meal expenses for the 316 students in the school are short by more than 2.8 million yuan per month. The school cannot subsidize the shortfall, and the students are threatened with starvation. If the provincial government does not change its methods, the students will have no choice but to drop out of school or continue to go hungry. The following requests have been submitted to the provincial government: (1) Request the provincial government to change the 4,000 yuan meal allowance to a rice substitute fund equivalent to 41.4 catties of rice at the market price, plus 3,000 yuan for supplementary food expenses. (2) Request the provincial government to allocate and lend current funds to purchase grain in order to alleviate the current food shortage.</p>
<h3>National Northeastern University Prepares to Move Back to Shenyang</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 22nd] National Northeastern University, originally located in Shenyang, moved to Santai, Sichuan, after the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War. It is reported that the university plans to move back to its original site within the year and is actively preparing for it.</p>
<h3>Book Shortage Problem: Mr. Gu Shusen Visits Shanghai Several Times to Discuss Future Solutions</h3>
<p>[Our City News] Mr. Gu Shusen, Director of the National Education Department of the Ministry of Education, has recently visited Shanghai several times to seek solutions to the book shortage problem in various regions. Due to paper shortages, transportation difficulties, and the prevalence of puppet textbooks in the recovered areas, the resulting textbook shortage problem has been repeatedly appealed by various parties and has aroused the serious attention of the Ministry of Education. In addition to repeatedly ordering local educational administrative agencies to strictly prohibit and destroy puppet textbooks, and imposing appropriate punishments on those who sell and use them, Director Gu recently came to Shanghai again to investigate the printing and supply of national textbooks. He also consulted with various bookstores to negotiate with the Enemy and Puppet Property Management Bureau and decided that all enemy and puppet newspapers sealed in warehouses would be purchased at cost by the National Textbook Supply Office for use in printing textbooks. Various companies have recently been raising funds to purchase and collect them in order to rush the printing. However, the quantity of sealed enemy paper is very small, and the total number that can be used for printing books is less than 40,000 reams. After returning to Nanjing, Mr. Gu plans to come to Shanghai again within days to guide various companies in finding additional ways to increase purchases and to help solve various technical difficulties, such as investigating the number of students in each province and city and the quantity of books needed, considering the adoption of cooperative methods, and resolving issues such as land and water transport tonnage and time. It is expected that the situation of books for schools in various regions will definitely improve this autumn.</p>
<h3>Respect Teachers Movement</h3>
<p>Fully Launched with Notable Achievements</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] Under the leadership of the Municipal Education Bureau, all sectors of this city have fully launched the Respect Teachers Movement, achieving notable results. We report to all parties as follows:</p>
<p>School Side</p>
<p>Most school authorities in this city have instructed students to solicit Respect Teachers Donations from their parents. On the parents' side, there are not a few who excuse themselves by claiming that paying the second round of tuition fees is already too much of a burden. However, those who feel that respecting teachers comes first and are eager to donate, believing it is their inescapable duty, account for seven or eight out of ten. Therefore, schools have been fairly successful in raising Respect Teachers Donations.</p>
<p>Committee Members Side</p>
<p>The Respect Teachers Movement Committee has appointed additional staff to post slogans and promote the Respect Teachers Movement with unreserved effort. However, regarding how to donate, the procedures are not yet clear to many committee members. Usually, donations have a register, but this time, because there is no register, many are still waiting and watching. However, some committee members have already donated spontaneously, submitting their donations directly to the designated bank for collection. In addition, committee member Yin Duhe recently broadcasted "The Meaning of Respecting Teachers" on Shanghai Radio, stating briefly: The Respect Teachers Movement is everyone's responsibility. For the sake of our second generation, we should be righteous and willing to contribute enthusiastically. Those with money should contribute money, providing material assistance. Everyone can watch one less play, smoke a few less packs of cigarettes, drink a few less glasses of wine, save on unnecessary expenses, and do a beneficial and righteous deed. Why not do it? Listeners were quite moved. The general director of the association, Mr. Li Ximou, will also broadcast on Shanghai Radio at 8 p.m. today, with the topic "Prospects for Shanghai Education."</p>
<p>Social Side</p>
<p>Famous Peking opera artists Mei Lanfang and Zhou Xinfang have performed charity shows to raise funds for the Respect Teachers Movement. It is also heard that the Peking opera performances of Mei Lanfang and Zhou Xinfang, as well as the singing of Guan Furen and Lang Yuxiu, will first be broadcast on Shanghai Radio. Famous calligraphers and painters Ma Gongyu and Zheng Wuchang have also invited famous calligraphers and painters in Shanghai to prepare for a charity exhibition of calligraphy and painting in support of respecting teachers. In addition, calligrapher Tan Yunshan, in response to the Respect Teachers Movement, has instructed the Wang Xingji Fan Shop to contribute 50% of his commission as Respect Teachers Donations, starting today. As for the business community, the Children's Bookstore has automatically held a "Respect Teachers Movement Week" and donated a percentage of its business revenue. The Wang Kai Photo Studio also automatically donated 300,000 yuan, setting an example for all sectors.</p>
<h3>Rectifying Past Academic Styles</h3>
<p>President Zhang Also Addresses Students Yesterday</p>
<p>[Dazhong News Agency] Zhang Yi, President of National Fudan University, due to the professors' suspension of teaching, convened a meeting of all students yesterday morning to address them, rectifying past academic styles, and encouraging all students to earnestly acquire knowledge. He also stated that the school's buildings are still lacking and classrooms are few. In the future, students returning from Chongqing will inevitably face difficulties in attending classes. Therefore, he is currently requesting the relevant authorities to allocate buildings left by the enemy Japanese to solve future difficulties.</p>
<h3>The Health and Hygiene of American Schoolchildren</h3>
<p>The illustration shows a nurse testing the eyesight of three girls in an American public school to determine whether or not they need glasses. This is but one of the many health measures. School doctors and nurses begin testing each kindergartener at the beginning of their school years. Several times a year, dentists also check their teeth. If a child has a disease, the school will immediately call the parents to discuss treatment. There is no place to treat dental diseases in the school, but children can visit dental hospitals for free treatment. Early treatment of common diseases can prevent serious conditions later in life. Regular exercises and competitions begin in the lower grades. Students from twelve to eighteen years old engage in more strenuous exercises and are also taught personal health and hygiene.</p>
<h3>Solving Pathways</h3>
<p>Pinglin University Preparatory Students Assigned to National Universities</p>
<p>[Dahua News Agency, Beiping] The pathways for the students of the Pinglin Provisional University Preparatory Class have been resolved. It is planned to assign them to national universities, divided into eight branches. The seventh branch will be taken over by the National Beiping Normal College. The eighth branch will either be established as an art specialty school or be converted into a Beiping branch of the National Hangzhou Art College. The first, second, and third branches will be accommodated by Mr. Fu Sinian, the acting president of Beiping University, as much as possible. The remaining will be assigned to Nankai or Tsinghua. The fourth branch will be taken over by Peking University and established as a School of Agriculture. The fifth branch will be jointly operated by Tsinghua and Peking University, with Tsinghua as the main body and Peking University providing teachers. The sixth branch has been decided to be taken over by Peking University and established as a School of Medicine, but it will temporarily maintain its independent nature, while the preparatory courses will be taken over by the School of Science.</p>

<h3>Ten Trends in American Education</h3>
<p>— Jiang Jianbai</p>
<p>In the last ten years or so, the educational administration and the schools themselves in the United States have undergone many new changes and adaptations. In terms of educational theory, the development of pragmatism has led to many revisions to the content of schools. Democracy, as the fundamental goal of education, has faced great threats from various theories in the last decade, and after much refinement, it has both strengthened its responsibilities and clarified its proper focus. Americans believe that democracy is the cornerstone of a free and equal society, with adaptability in people's livelihoods and government forms, developing in a dynamic and progressive process. Therefore, education is a dynamic adaptation that complements and reinforces democracy.</p>
<p>Due to the adaptations arising from environmental needs, the research and exploration of educational leaders, the exchange of ideas, the mobility and implementation of teachers, and the dissemination of new means of communication—newspapers, movies, and radio—among the people, certain opinions and proposals can be harmonized and compromised, gradually converging. The author has summarized the progress in American education over the past decade or so, and the central issues for development in the next ten or twenty years, into ten major trends, and will outline them below:</p>
<p>(1) The Defects of Local Administration and the Development of Central Authority and Responsibility: American education has always emphasized local freedom and development. Although the 111,500 educational administrative units across the United States have common points, they also have significant differences. Most states are only legally in charge, while the federal government has no regulations on educational matters in the constitution. As a result of the development of local units, many malpractices have inevitably occurred in some areas: (1) Manipulation by party factions, (2) Interference by local bullies, (3) Units that are too small to develop independently, (4) Lack of local leaders, (5) Weak economic strength, (6) Difficulties in youth training and relief, (7) Inability to balance and universalize compulsory education, and (8) Reduced educational standards and lack of national adaptability are all significant issues. Therefore, during the Roosevelt administration, there were organizations for youth training and relief, civilian assistance camps, and teacher work administration, all of which were managed by the federal government. During the war, some educational administration was directly handled by the federal government. The federal government's participation in and management of educational matters was originally for relief needs and for areas that could not be managed locally, but over time, it gradually became a precedent. This fact has caused serious disputes in the national education community. On the one hand, it is recognized that local units have certain factual shortcomings and that there should be a need for overall assistance, while on the other hand, it is desired to preserve the free development of localities and to avoid federal control of education. Some educational scholars have a compromise proposal, believing that the federal government should play an encouraging and leading role, and provide as much financial assistance as possible. All matters to be handled should be managed by local governments through administration. In other words, the federal government should subsidize funding without adding control, but certain special matters can also be handled by the central government. In the future, a Federal Education Agency can be established, with the case passed by Congress and directly under Congress, as a leadership research, coordination, and liaison agency. Due to the above-mentioned facts and opinions, future educational administration will, on the one hand, maintain a considerable degree of local freedom, and on the other hand, the central authority and responsibility will also have further development. On the one hand, it cannot be centralism, and on the other hand, it will not be entirely local decentralization. This is the trend for the future.</p>
<p>(2) Education's Social Policy and the Launching of Civil Rights: Educational scholars recognize that education is a social policy, not something transcendent and independent. The objectives set by social policy and the methods it uses should be consistent and mutually reinforcing. Certain objectives must be achieved by certain methods, and only certain methods can achieve the true objectives. The social policy of the United States is democratic socialism, so the social policy of education is to develop democracy—a way of life that is free and equal. Since the goal is to achieve democracy, the method must also be democratic, that is, only democratic methods can achieve democratic goals. The main purpose of educational administration is to promote and develop the goals and methods of this social policy. Therefore, it is necessary to educate young people, train the public, and exert democratic civil rights to make them a source and base of power. The launching of this base relies on the power of education, and the expansion of education's function depends on this base of the public. The American education community deeply feels that local utilitarian groups and individuals exert heavy pressure, causing many obstacles to the progress of education and the welfare of the educated. The only way to resolve this is to appeal to the people, use civil rights, and exert public power, because education belongs to the people and is managed under the trust of the people. Educational administration that educates the people and assists in educational facilities is the spirit of democracy. This has become a common trend loudly and urgently called for by knowledgeable people in the education community.</p>
<p>(3) Implementing Balanced Planning to Accelerate Equal Opportunities: The United States has been implementing compulsory education for several years, and there has certainly been significant progress in both quantity and quality. However, according to surveys and statistics, the number of people who can read but not write and those who cannot read or write still account for 7% to 8% according to American illiteracy standards, and the level of education varies greatly. The basic reason is the difference in economic ability. Taking a class unit as an example, the highest annual expenditure reaches $6,000, while the lowest is only $100, a difference of sixty times. This difference varies from state to state, from county to county within the same state, and from village to village. The disparity between rich and poor families is also shocking. Children are all national treasures and have the right to equal educational opportunities. They cannot be deprived of their due rights in education due to differences in local and family economic strength. In recent years, the United States has made great progress and contributions to the study of educational economics and educational finance. Educational scholars are very aware of the interrelationship between national economic development and educational economics, and have incorporated educational economics into the proper domain of education to break the economic inequality of educational opportunities and implement a balanced plan in educational finance. The content of this plan is based on the existing funding of each school level in each state, to find the average of each state, and then list the average of each state in a table, taking the median number as the national minimum standard. The differences within each state are also handled in this way, setting a minimum standard for a certain state. Each locality should complete the minimum standard of that locality according to its wealth and the degree of effort in raising funds, and the shortfall should be made up by the state's overall planning. Each state should complete the national minimum standard according to its wealth and the degree of effort, and the shortfall should be made up by federal appropriations. In other words, the federal appropriation standard is determined according to the amount needed by each state to complete the national minimum standard. The lower the distance from the national minimum standard, the more appropriations, and the higher the distance, the less appropriations or no appropriations. The method of each state for its localities is also the same. The purpose of this balanced plan is to alleviate economic barriers and increase equal opportunities. The federal government has repeatedly passed appropriation bills in Congress, and the states are implementing them separately. This plan will continue to be promoted and continue to raise standards, and will be a major policy in future educational administration.</p>
<p>(4) Emphasis on Infant Education and Adaptation to Individual Differences in Elementary Schools: Most universities have departments of infant education, and the number of people studying infant education is increasing year by year in proportion. The number of infant education classes established in various places is also increasing year by year. This is because the individual differences and the development and cultivation of interests in infancy occupy an important position, and parents are unable to take care of infants due to work, which affects their future. This is a social responsibility and the work of educators. There will be no end to the development of infant education in the future. As for the elementary school stage, the most significant progress in recent years has been the widespread emphasis on and adaptation to individual differences. There are as many as four or five groups in the same grade, with each group having three, five, or seven students. Their progress is divided according to their intellectual development and interests. The learning experience is presented and guided according to their interests and needs. In addition to the class teachers, there are expert consultant teachers, expert psychology teachers, and specialist doctors and psychiatrists, all of whom are assigned by the educational administrative organs. Large-scale schools have all the personnel, and decentralized small-scale schools are assigned by region. Consultant teachers and psychology expert teachers are particularly common. In the past few years, there has been great progress in the actualization of teaching in elementary education. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Four Banks Joint Office Revises Investment and Discount Methods, Treating State-Owned and Private Enterprises Equally</h3>
<p>The Joint Office of the Bank of China, Central Bank, Bank of Communications, and Agricultural Bank of China has revised its investment and discount policy in order to cooperate with the government's economic recovery policy, balance prices, and promote production. The methods that loan applicants should adopt for investment and loans to state-owned and private enterprises, as well as the points they should comply with, have also been revised at the same time. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>For all investment and loan applications for public and private industrial, mining, agricultural, and forestry enterprises, the branches of the Four Banks Joint Office shall first designate professional personnel, or entrust relevant competent authorities, to conduct a thorough investigation of the personnel organization, business, plant assets, equipment, and operating results of each enterprise. Only those that meet the following conditions may be invested and loaned:</p>
<p>(1) The business is suitable for the economic recovery policy, balancing prices, promoting production, and facilitating trade, and the operation has achieved results.</p>
<p>(2) The organization is sound, the technology is excellent, and the products are selling well.</p>
<p>(3) The machinery, equipment, and raw materials can be continuously supplied, and the work has officially started, or will start in the shortest possible time.</p>
<p>(4) The purpose of the loan is legitimate.</p>
<p>As for state-owned business institutions, if it is necessary to borrow funds in advance for budgetary approvals, they should first obtain a guarantee from the competent authority and file it with the Ministry of Finance before proceeding with the Four Banks and Two Bureaus.</p>
<p>For emergency projects that need funds outside the government budget to promote national policies, they should consult with the highest competent authority of the central government, obtain the consent of the Ministry of Finance, and then proceed with the application after guaranteeing it.</p>
<p>If borrowing working capital outside the government budget and repaying it with its own ability, it should be handled in accordance with the loan methods for private enterprises, and the competent authority shall be responsible for guaranteeing it.</p>
<p>The Four Banks shall carefully audit the financial accounting of the private enterprise units assisted by investment and loans. If deemed necessary, they may send personnel to be stationed in each unit. If the Four Banks believe that the financial accounting of each unit needs to be improved, each unit should accept it as much as possible.</p>
<p>The production items of the invested business units should reach a certain limit, and the monthly production and sales volume and value should be reported to the Four Banks for verification on a regular basis.</p>
<p>If any hoarding and speculation are found in the products manufactured by each borrowing unit, all loan principal and interest, whether due or not, shall be recovered immediately by the office.</p>
<p>Regarding export trade products, for goods that have arrived at the exporting port, the exporter should handle foreign exchange settlement with the bank and apply for packing loans or acceptance drafts.</p>
<p>As for merchants who purchase goods at the place of production, they may negotiate with the Four Banks and Two Bureaus for collateral loans and collateral drafts when purchasing raw materials and manufacturing packaging and transportation at the place of production. The term of this collateral loan shall not exceed three months.</p>
<p>For merchants who pledge daily necessities, they should be limited to merchants who operate in the industry and join the industry association. During the recovery period, each industry may apply for loans by pledging existing raw materials or finished products on the principle of not promoting hoarding and speculation due to insufficient working capital. In addition, transportation will be more convenient in the future, and production enterprises can also apply to the Four Banks for collateral drafts when purchasing raw materials and materials from other ports or transporting finished products to other ports. However, the term of the collateral loan shall not exceed three months and shall not be extended.</p>
<p>The office also stipulates that all central government agencies should clear all loans borrowed with expenses to be received in the past when they expire and should not be extended.</p>
<p>All local government agencies should clear all loans borrowed from the Four Banks in the past within the time limit in accordance with the unified national treasury revenue and expenditure methods stipulated by the Ministry of Finance.</p>
<p>For all industrial, mining, transportation, agricultural, forestry, water conservancy, and trade enterprises belonging to central and local government agencies that have debt relations with the Four Banks, the Four Banks shall investigate their business and, if necessary, recover part or all of the loans before they are due.</p>
<p>In addition to the various loans mentioned above, the Joint Office shall also step up the supervision of borrowers to fulfill their obligations to repay principal and interest in accordance with the agreement for all other joint discount loans.</p>
<p>According to authoritative sources in the Four Banks Joint Office, any industrial, mining, manufacturing, or trading companies that need to borrow funds in the future must complete the procedures before applying. The government authorities, in order to develop state-owned and private enterprises in a mutually complementary manner, have decided to treat state-owned and private enterprises equally for operating capital loans, so as to avoid emphasizing one over the other.</p>
<h3>Police Constantly Patrol, Government Bonds Still Active</h3>
<p>Government bonds were slightly active yesterday because the accounts of large investors were full. The meeting places were broken up into smaller units and gathered together in the east and west. However, they were often dispersed by the police. Tongbing opened in the morning and jumped to over 5,700 yuan. Buyers continued to scramble to absorb them, creating a new high price of 5,980 yuan in the middle. However, the price of a thousand yuan was soon frustrated because the buying and selling could not proceed smoothly. The bulls took profits and gradually fell back, with the low price falling to 5,600 yuan. Finally, they still stood above 5,700 yuan. As a result, the price of Jia and Yi rose 470 yuan compared with Saturday, Bing rose 250 yuan, Ding rose 400 yuan, and Wu rose 300 yuan.</p>
<h3>Mexican Gasoline Shipped to China in Separate Packages</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Mexico City, 22nd] The Commercial Daily reported that the Chinese oil tanker "Hung Cho" is currently loading a large amount of gasoline in Tampico to be shipped to Shanghai for delivery. The "Hung Cho" is the first Chinese merchant ship to dock in Tampico. It is reported that another large batch of gasoline orders will be shipped to China by Chinese oil tankers. China has become a new market for Mexican gasoline.</p>
<h3>The Result of Rice Loans: Market Prices Steadily Stand at High Peaks, Rumor Has It That 10,000 Bags Will Arrive in Shanghai, Food Administration Office Discusses Suppression and Stabilization Measures</h3>
<p>The first phase of the rice industry loan of 100 billion yuan caused rice prices to soar at the beginning of its disbursement, and all sectors expressed dissatisfaction, believing that the measures were a failure. The municipal government and food administration authorities attached great importance to this and, in addition to advising those who received rice loans to immediately go to the producing areas to purchase rice, also sent personnel to secretly investigate the market for any instances of using loans to hoard rice. It is now known that, under the strict supervision of the authorities and the urging of public opinion, most of the rice merchants who obtained loans have indeed sent personnel to Suzhou, Wuxi, Songjiang, Kunshan, Qingpu, Jiashan, and other producing areas to carry out purchases. Among them, 10,000 piculs have been transported to Shanghai by land. They will continue to arrive one after another and will be sold on the market at any time to meet the needs. The food administration authorities declared that rice prices should gradually return to lower levels in the future, with sufficient supply. They hope that major factories or companies that need rice will not purchase it in large quantities on the market, which will cause rice prices to rise. If a large purchase is needed, it is best to go directly to the producing area to purchase it, and the food administration authorities are very willing to assist and facilitate it. It is also known that the Office of the Food Administration Commissioner held a meeting yesterday morning, gathering the persons in charge of the flour mills, rice mills, and grain merchants under its jurisdiction. It was presided over by Acting Commissioner Wang Daren. It is reported that in addition to reviewing past work, the issue of suppressing and stabilizing rice prices and stabilizing the market in the future was discussed.</p>
<p>Yesterday, rice seemed firm in the morning and slack in the afternoon, with little activity. Flour was selling very well and the supply could not meet the demand. It continued to rise again by 300 to 400 yuan, and miscellaneous brands of flour rose by 700 to 800 yuan. Bran was still being digested in the interior and continued to rise again by 500 yuan. Soybeans from Zhejiang were slightly taken and the local street price rose by more than 1,000 yuan. Bean cake was tight in the morning and slack in the afternoon, with the price increasing by 100 yuan. Raw kernels remained stable. Red beans from Hong Kong and Luzon were very popular, and sellers became more firm, with demand exceeding supply, and prices not being offered. The oil market still had a lot of goods arriving and sales were still acceptable. Vegetable oil, green oil, and soybean oil all increased by about 500 to 1,000 yuan. According to rice market news, yesterday, a total of eight types of white japonica rice, totaling more than 8,800 piculs, arrived in the city. The types and piculs are as follows: White japonica 3,964 piculs, thin rice 2,024 piculs, early rice 1,643 piculs, yangxian 128 piculs, duxian 602 piculs, wuxian 120 piculs, baiyuan 200 piculs, yinyuan 180 piculs.</p>
<h3>The Yarn Market Is Mediocre, Small-Scale Yarn Still Has Strong Demand</h3>
<p>The yarn market was extremely mediocre yesterday. About 10,000 bales of 20-count Shuangma yarn were not traded because the Cantonese brokers had no intention of buying, so the large-scale factory yarn was lackluster. On the contrary, small-scale yarn was thriving and continued to rise by more than 10,000 yuan. Customers from various ports along the Beijing-Shanghai railway had strong demand for small and medium-sized 20-count yarn. The existing stock still could not meet the demand. Yesterday was also the time for Qufang Jiankai Yarn to offer 29 counts of yarn and thread as usual, with each color from 1 count to 100 counts available. The price of 420-count yarn was marked down by 45,000 yuan, and the rest was average.</p>
<h3>Spot Cotton Trading Is Quite Active</h3>
<p>Yesterday, New York American cotton continued to be closed, and there were still no telegrams. Spot cotton trading in this port has become more active. Factories are making a good profit by buying cotton and spinning yarn, so private yarn factories have a strong need for cotton. The intention of industry players to absorb cotton is still strong. Statistics show that 1,350 bales were traded, and the market price was tight, continuing to rise by 1,200 yuan.</p>
<h3>Wool Continues to Arrive with Orders</h3>
<p>The wool market was still sluggish yesterday. Retail sales were good, but wholesale sales were limited. British and American orders continued to arrive, such as Wanliding women's colored wool fabrics. In addition, Bi Ji Tu samples used for making suits also arrived in port. It is said that the cost price of each book is 8.5 US dollars, and the market price is 20,000 yuan. Industry players, seeing the high profits from the arrival of goods, all want to be the first to order them. Yesterday, foreign firms such as Jardine Matheson, Lawford, and Changming had transactions.</p>
<h3>Gold and Banknotes Are Both Weak</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the spot market was peaceful. Due to the situation, people's minds were still stable. The opening was slightly higher. Securities firms took profits at high prices. Although the allocation price of the Bank of China has not changed, no one remembered it. However, suppliers saw that the gold market had entered a consolidation phase and supplied the market one after another. The price once fell to 1.55 million yuan in the middle of the day, and then gradually stabilized, but the momentum of the rebound was limited. At noon, it was around 1.56 million yuan. The afternoon was also mediocre. As a result, it continued to fall by 15,000 compared with last Saturday. Jewelry gold was 168,000, pure silver was 1,600, and silver dollars were still stable. The hidden discount was average, and the interest rate was from 12% to 15%.</p>
<p>Foreign currency US dollars were settled less frequently, and the buying interest was weak. Holders began to sell off one after another. American firms continued to supply, and the chips gradually became loose. It hovered down from 2,220 yuan in the early morning. It once fell to 2,150 yuan before noon. At noon, it was hovering around 2,170 yuan. The afternoon may be slightly weaker, falling by 10 yuan. As a result, it continued to fall by 55 yuan compared with the previous close. Hong Kong notes were also dragged down by 5 yuan due to the unfavorable overall situation. Hong Kong telegram was 415 yuan, Robi was 515 yuan, and the US exchange rate was still flat, with designated banks supplying 2,050 yuan slightly.</p>
<h3>Chinese Stocks Implement Next-Day Settlement, Market Buying Interest Suddenly Strong, Foreign Stocks Jardine Matheson and British-American Tobacco Are the Hottest</h3>
<p>Chinese stocks implemented next-day settlement yesterday, which slightly stimulated people's hearts. The opening immediately saw a slight increase. After the opening, the buying momentum once became strong. Yongsheng Yarn rose to 5,250 yuan, Meiya 4,450 yuan, and Jingfu 450 yuan. Those who took profits rushed in. After that, the situation turned and trading gradually became leisurely. The market situation also changed from splendid to bland. Market prices did not advance but retreated. At noon, all prices were low. Buyers of Yongsheng Yarn and Meiya waited and watched. Meiya was slightly inferior. Qindian sold stocks short, and the price was stronger than Xinguang. The noon close was up 280 yuan for Yongsheng Yarn, only 50 yuan for Meiya, 10 yuan for Jingfu, 18 yuan for Xinguang, and 33 yuan for Qinxing, while the rise and fall of other stocks were slight. The same was true for veteran stocks. Speculative forces in foreign stocks focused on Jardine Matheson and British-American Tobacco. The two hot stocks have both risen to outside the 14,000 yuan mark. Seeing that the situation was hot again, securities firms rushed to make up for it. The two major hot stocks rose straight up, approaching the 15,000 mark near noon. The noon close finally broke through. As a result, Jardine Matheson and British-American Tobacco each rose by less than 10% compared with last Saturday, and the rest followed up by about 5%.</p>
<h3>The Third Allocation of 500 Boxes of Rayon</h3>
<p>According to this newspaper, the application procedures for the third allocation of 500 boxes of rayon have been handled by the Electrical Industry Association starting today. The prices are recorded as follows: 1.36 million yuan for 120 count bright, 1.38 million yuan for 120 count semi-dull, and 1.41 million yuan for 75 count semi-dull.</p>
<h3>Chinese Silk: Highly Welcomed by American Silk Industry, But Must Be Inexpensive and Stable</h3>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 22nd] According to the Commercial Daily, silk industry circles here believe that the various difficult issues concerning Chinese currency have been sufficiently clarified to resume the import trade of Chinese silk, and declare that they are quite willing to accept China as a permanent source of silk supply. They believe that although there is competition from mixed fiber fabrics, natural silk still occupies a firm place in the American market. Traders are willing to carry out large-scale plans to develop new uses for natural silk and improve its quality.</p>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 22nd] Mr. Doudan, manager of the American Testing Company, recently returned to the country after representing the American government on a tour of Japan. He said: If silk is to compete with rayon fabrics, it must focus on quality rather than price. In order for textile factories to re-adopt silk, it must first be more profitable to use silk as a raw material than rayon. Silk prices must be stabilized, and special attention must be paid to quality.</p>
<h3>Sugar Prices Rise Again</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market was initially soft in the morning because it was the period for another tender. The Central Sand and White Association set a price of 51,500 yuan per thousand, but in the afternoon, because actual sales were still active, prices rose again, reaching 52,500 yuan to 53,000 yuan. Another 3,000 bags of Central Sand and White sugar were tendered at 51,000 yuan, an increase of 7,000 yuan. 2,200 bags of three-and-a-half white sugar were tendered at 61,000 yuan, an increase of 3,000 yuan. All were sold. 1,000 bags of raw sugar were tendered at 48,000 yuan, an increase of 6,000 yuan, but were not all sold. The market is selling 54,500 bags of Central Sand and White sugar.</p>
<h3>Chinese Embroidery Goods</h3>
<p>The First Batch in Five Years Has Arrived in Sydney</p>
<p>[Reuters, Sydney, 22nd] The first batch of Chinese embroidery goods in five years has arrived in Sydney, transported by the newly established Sino-Australian Air Transport Company.</p>
<h3>Goods Transportation Not Smooth: Uneven Slackness in Medicinal Materials</h3>
<p>Domestic medicinal materials have been sluggish for many months, due to transportation obstructions and frequent interruptions of freight transport. In the Tianjin market, goods from Guangdong can earn double the profit. Merchants from the Guizhou and Xi'an regions often come to purchase goods in person, mostly Guangdong goods. Therefore, although Guangdong goods dealers have received a large batch of Mu Xiang, which has not been seen for several years, namely Yin Yuan Xiang, opening price is 1,650 yuan, old Yuan Xiang opening price is 3,400 yuan, Gong Liao Xiang opening price is 1,000 yuan, Yuan Mo Yao opening price is 700 yuan, etc., the market price is still considered profitable, and Guangdong dealers can also make a profit. Shipping from Shantou has been obstructed for four or five years, but it has now resumed, although only for sporadic mountain goods. There is business from Taiwan, and the quantity is also strong, mostly Sichuan-Han mountain goods. Labor for various dealers in the Shanghai market can therefore remain stable, but Guangdong dealers find it difficult to profit from goods prices due to the lack of smooth shipping, and mostly take a wait-and-see attitude. However, Ming Dang Jie Geng and other mountain goods are urgently needed in Guangdong because they have not been shipped for several years. Sichuan-Han dealers find it difficult to calculate prices for incoming goods, and it is difficult to make a profit on outgoing goods due to the high cost of transportation from Sichuan.</p>
<h3>White Coal Prices Turn Stable, Bituminous Coal Trends Downward Again</h3>
<p>The coal market sees sporadic transactions of white coal, and sales are still not smooth. However, it is rumored that the price has stopped falling and turned stable, because a small-scale group organization has recently been formed by Shanghai distributors, setting uniform prices, unlike the previous chaos of selling off at falling prices. The price distributed to dealers is 320,000 yuan per ton for Yangquan Tongkuai (80-90% screened lump) and 220,000 yuan per ton for Sino-British Tongkuai. The price at which dealers resell on the market is 350,000-360,000 yuan for Yangquan screened lump and 220,000-230,000 yuan for Sino-British screened lump. After screening out coal dust and adding handling fees, the profit is extremely small. After bituminous coal was allocated at a flat price from dealers, a small number of factories that have not resumed work are reselling the allocated coal on the market. The market is flooded with goods, market sentiment is weak, and prices continue to trend downward.</p>
<h3>Bank of China Stipulates Principles for Loans to Exporters</h3>
<p>According to financial sources, in order to cooperate with the government's economic policies and encourage exports, the Bank of China has recently decided to approve mortgage loans based on the consignment of goods for collection by exporters, and stipulates the following three principles for packing loans:</p>
<p>(1) Exporters must provide a letter of credit opened abroad when using funds.</p>
<p>(2) Exporters provide export goods, and the price is discounted by 50% to 80% based on the conditions specified in the letter of credit as collateral, stored in the bank's warehouse or a designated warehouse, and the packing is managed by personnel dispatched by the lending bank.</p>
<p>(3) The term of the packing loan shall not exceed three months at most.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea Remain Unremarkable</h3>
<p>Yesterday's silk market conditions were not much different from the previous weekend, but the price of ordinary silk goods was slightly higher. Rayon No. 120 Tianqiao opened at 1.4 million yuan and closed at 1.41 million yuan, still at the original price of the previous weekend. The price of miscellaneous brands with light suddenly shortened by 40,000 yuan. Jiuxing Silk Shop sold Golden Ring Star for 1.32 million yuan. The market price of silk goods did not fluctuate much. The price of Meiya material remained at the original price of the previous weekend. Dachen checkered material was slightly higher by 20-30 yuan. Minsheng autumn continued to trade at a price of 4,900 yuan per yard.</p>
<p>In addition to Hangzhou and Wenzhou, where Qiqiang green tea has been on the market for a long time, Shaoxing Pingshui's output is also not bad. It is reported that it is approaching harvest time and will be shipped to Shanghai soon. In the local tea market, old goods are being sold more than new goods, and the situation is extremely weak. The new Longjing item from Wenzhou and Hangzhou has seen holders crowding and rushing to sell, but because the quality is gradually deteriorating, the price is also trending downward.</p>
<h3>Fertilizer Price Almost Doubles</h3>
<p>Industrial raw materials have arrived, and market prices have not changed significantly. Yuepai burnt alkali is 33,000 yuan, American goods are 28,000 yuan, Vaseline is 700 yuan, white oil is 400 yuan, pure alkali is 55,000 yuan, bleaching powder is 550 yuan, insurance powder is 225,000 yuan, and white wax has arrived, falling to 155,000 yuan per dan. However, the price of fertilizer has risen due to purchases by Shantou dealers, from 700,000 per ton to 1.35 million. The current stock is very scarce.</p>
<h3>American New Invention: Durable Laundry Starch</h3>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 22nd] The American Rubber Company recently announced that it has developed a durable laundry starch. The effectiveness of this laundry starch remains even after washing clothes. It has a wide range of applications and is suitable for cotton and rayon products. The ingredients are extremely fine and cannot be seen with an ordinary microscope. It does not yellow over time and has no effect on the skin.</p>
<h3>Anglo-American Tea Agreement Expires: Resumption of Private Trade</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 22nd] The agreement between the American government and Britain regarding tea has expired, and the purchase and import of tea has now resumed its private commercial nature. In order to regulate the tea trade, the United States has established an import licensing system, stipulating that the maximum price must be maintained.</p>
<h3>Simplification of Income Tax Collection: Ministry of Finance Denies Chamber of Commerce's Request</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The Municipal Chamber of Commerce previously submitted a telegram to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance on January 17, requesting that a simplified method for collecting income tax in the recovered areas be separately formulated, so that municipal businesses could overcome difficulties, consider all aspects, and fulfill the request for handling. Yesterday, a telegram was received from the Ministry of Finance stating that the assessment of income tax is based on the operating income of each business, which is different from the nature of land tax, and therefore cannot be exempted by analogy.</p>
<h3>Hubei Tung Oil and Shandong Salt Arrive in Shanghai One After Another</h3>

<p>Elements 95 and 96 Discovered</p>
<p>Professor G.T. Seaborg, chemistry professor at the University of Chicago and discoverer of element 93, Plutonium, announced the new discovery of elements 95 and 96 in a speech at the American Chemical Society. Seaborg, who studied atomic bombs with other prominent scientists at the University of Chicago, said that these new elements can be produced by bombarding uranium U238 and plutonium PU239 with high-energy helium ions in a cyclotron. In another speech on December 13 of last year, Seaborg explicitly stated that Plutonium is the basic raw material for making atomic bombs.</p>
<p>British Atomic Scientists Association Established</p>
<p>The British Atomic Scientists Association, representing all scientists in the UK who study atomic science, has been established. The main tasks of the association are:</p>
<p>(1) To disseminate and explain the latest developments in atomic energy to scientists and the public everywhere. (2) To review British and international policies regarding the development and management of atomic energy. (3) To maintain contact with overseas atomic scientists groups at any time.</p>
<p>Another Contribution to Penicillin</p>
<p>Patients with scarlet fever now have to be isolated from the outside world for at least three or four weeks. However, with Penicillin treatment, the isolation period can be shortened to ten days. This is the conclusion reached by four medical doctors from Harvard Medical School and Boston Hospital after clinical trials. Penicillin has no side effects on rashes or poisoning-related diseases.</p>

<h3>A Tour of the YVA Power Circle</h3>
<p>— Lin Han</p>
<p>According to Savage's Yangtze River Hydropower Project plan, a hydropower project will be built in Yichang Gorge, with the power plant located inside a mountain cave (to prevent air raids). It will be equipped with 90 generators, each with approximately 150,000 horsepower, totaling approximately 15 million horsepower, generating 10,056,000 kilowatts. Its supply river reaches Nanjing, Yibin, Chengdu, Guilin, Guiyang, Tianshui and other places. Moreover, this project can absorb the Yangtze River's major floods, irrigate approximately 60 million acres of farmland, and allow giant ships with a displacement of 10,000 tons to reach Chongqing directly.</p>
<p>This is indeed a magnificent and extraordinary plan. Since Savage proposed it to President Chiang and the US government, the governments, industrialists, engineers, and civilians of China and the United States have been constantly thinking about it, dreaming about it day and night! Therefore, I think the draft of the YVA plan has already been drafted in everyone's mind, so-called "Everything is ready, only waiting for the east wind." As long as the project is done well, any plan will become a reality. We might as well take a spiritual tour of this YVA power circle first to get a general idea.</p>
<p>For convenience, let's take Yichang as the center, and draw a circle with the straight-line distance from Yichang to Nanjing or Guilin as the radius. This circle can be called the YVA power circle. Suppose we depart from Shanghai and take a 10,000-ton ocean-going ship straight to Chongqing. When we arrive in Nanjing, we will be able to see the world of electricity. The trams, needless to say, will be faster and more numerous than the foreign-owned trams in Shanghai. The traffic will be so busy that we will not have to wait in long lines or squeeze onto the cars. The political city of Nanjing will surely grow some silent, smokeless factories! At night, it will still be the Nanjing of the daytime. Sailing upstream from Nanjing, if it is a night voyage, you can see cities shining brightly on the shore. The broadcasts of radio will give you comfort and drive away monotony and loneliness. When you get to Wuhan, you may be surprised that the number of smokestacks in Wuhan, the national center of heavy industry, has decreased, or that some of them no longer emit black smoke. But when you go into the factory to visit, you can see that its machines are still moving up and down! In addition, you can find many manufacturers with old brands from Shanghai or ...., or emerging chemical plants, smelting plants, electrical plants, etc., decorating the great Wuhan. Moreover, here, you don't have to call a rickshaw to drag you to Zhongshan Park or Luojia Mountain for a visit as you used to. You can just spend the price of a cigarette to get on the tram and reach your destination comfortably. Also, here, you can choose some inexpensive and high-quality industrial products from the available ones, which are better than imported goods, and you will be completely satisfied. The ship arrives in Yichang—this is a place famous at home and abroad, with factories standing in great numbers, worthy of being the industrial center of VYA! Yichang upstream, past the magnificent water gate, where giant cranes or winches will be used to lift this 10,000-ton ship up, or open the water gate wide to let the giant ship rush up! After entering the Three Gorges, you can't help but stand on the deck and browse the towering cliffs, but you will hear deafening machine noises, and you can see wooden signs hanging in front of each stone cave that say "No Visitors Allowed." You can imagine that in addition to the power plants hidden inside, there are also many national defense-related heavy industries hidden there! When you arrive in Chongqing, the citizens there will surely welcome you, this 10,000-ton ship, with surprise. At that time, you will see Chongqing, which has declined after the war and is now re-energized. The bright capital will no longer have power outages in different districts, and the factories will no longer have to stop work due to a shortage of coal! Here, you have to part ways with the ocean-going ship you took. You can taste the electric train on Chengyu Street. On the way, you can go to Ziliujing to see the electrolytic salt industry there. Chengdu, a famous ancient city, is wearing a thin modern dress, decorated with light industry or chemical industry; from here north to Tianshui, from Baotian, Longhai, Jinpu three railways back to Nanjing, along the way you can see the rising national industry, the previous purely rural life has undergone a revolution, people's lives will always be improved, life will no longer be stained with foreign goods! They have reached the point of self-sufficiency! Or going south from Chongqing to Guiyang, you can see that Guizhou, which is known for its poverty, has changed its appearance, and the saying that "people have no three cents of silver" is no longer applicable. In addition, the aluminum mines stored in Guizhou will be refined in large quantities. Then take the Guizhou-Guangxi railway train from Guiyang to Guilin. This time, it is guaranteed that you will not be stranded in the remote mountains and wilderness due to poor coal quality or lack of coal; when you arrive in Guilin, the booming light industry there, the clear city appearance, and the bustling tourists have given you a very good impression! From here, you can take the Xiang-Gui Road and the Yue-Han Road to see Hunan, the granary of China. The electrified agriculture will arouse your great interest!</p>
<p>After such a rough walk, you will always feel that in this big circle, the face has indeed changed, there are really all kinds of things, everything is electric, you can't see it all, you can't say it all, and there is a feeling of joy.</p>
<h3>Collection of Feelings</h3>
<p>— Wang Xingzhuang</p>
<p>Judging from the current situation, the blood of soldiers is cheap, the mouths of public officials are cheap, and the pens of journalists are cheap.</p>
<p>The most profound irony in the world is not produced by writers, but widely exists in every corner of society.</p>
<p>A senator from County submitted a proposal to the Senate, asking the Senate to ask the County government to buy a few atomic cars. People have not used them yet, but some of us advocate buying them. Who says that everything in China is backward? Isn't our enjoyment hundreds of years ahead of others?</p>
<p>Opium, bound feet, braids... are our forgotten national treasures. And the current national treasure is the very simple word "nobility". When a part of the people are overwhelmed by life, the average outsider can easily use "nobility" to shut their mouths. As a result, society is peaceful and tranquil.</p>
<h3>New Words</h3>
<p>— Yang Huai</p>
<p>"Spring cold" is not to be feared, it only freezes your hands and feet; be careful! "The coldness of human feelings" will freeze your heart.</p>
<p>A hero is one who can withstand the whip in the open but cannot withstand the tricks in the dark. A great power should also be like this.</p>
<p>The beginning of all "clumsy" things in the world is often the desire to "be clever", and the result is futile.</p>
<p>On the "March 8th" Women's Day, a modern woman took the stage to give a speech:</p>
<p>"...Now prices are soaring, and everything is expensive. However, there is one thing that is the least valuable, and that is the warmth and tenderness of men..."</p>
<p>The women in the audience applauded thunderously.</p>
<p>Deception is the greatest enemy of love, but many people in love like to cultivate this enemy.</p>
<p>Balzac said: "Love is a lovely flower, but you must have the courage to pick it on the edge of a terrible cliff." Therefore, how many careless or clumsy people in ancient and modern times have been buried in the deep valley for that "lovely flower".</p>
<p>A person only feels the joy of deceiving others and forgets the sadness of deceiving himself. - So-called "deceiving others is deceiving oneself."</p>
<p>Humans are the most intelligent of all things, but understanding "between people" is more difficult than mutual understanding between any animals; a country is composed of people, so understanding "between countries" is even more difficult.</p>
<h3>Words of Experience</h3>
<p>— Analyzer</p>
<p>(1) Men and women with brilliant personalities possess two talents: the art of dealing with the world and the art of dealing with oneself.</p>
<p>(2) Learn to cope with difficulties and learn to prepare for failure.</p>
<p>(3) You should be temperate, you should be cooperative, and you should be moderate in your ambitions.</p>
<p>(4) Loneliness is not a disaster, but a blessing. It gives us the opportunity to settle our own affairs and the opportunity to formulate our life strategies.</p>
<p>(5) We need lonely thinking and smart introspection.</p>
<p>Social Services</p>
<h3>Replies to Readers - Medical and Health</h3>
<p>Chen Xuelu asks: I was framed by a friend last April, who designed to defraud and embezzle important seals, causing severe mental stimulation. At that time, I only knew that those people had created evidence and the organization was complete, and I could not resist. I was panic-stricken, worried, angry, and suspicious, and finally went to the neurology department of the Red Cross Hospital for treatment. I was hospitalized for 50 days and injected with 25 doses of Yishi Meng factor Lin produced by Yang's Pharmaceutical Factory, thinking that I was cured and discharged. Now, a year later, I feel weak, and many diseases are born, such as dizziness, deafness, blurred vision, especially the mind is like a monkey, thinking is degraded, like the mind and brain are gone, but timid as a mouse, liver fire is strong. I am suffering from such a serious disease in my later years, and a family of six is ​​likely to become hungry corpses. I would like to ask: (1) Is this disease affected by injections? (2) Is there a most effective treatment method, and how long will it take to heal at least? (3) Can traditional Chinese medicines such as Ma Bao be used, and are there any other miraculous pills?</p>
<p>Dr. Tang Renjin answers: (1) Injections will definitely have no effect. (2) Focus on psychotherapy, followed by drugs. You can use brain-boosting and strengthening agents, such as drugs containing arsenic and phosphorus. A good environment of at least one year is required. (3) The drug has no clinical and theoretical basis, and I dare not assert.</p>
<p>Ding Yuanji asks: My father developed herpes zoster on his left arm in July last autumn, and had a small hole on his ankle. Both feet were swollen, and the wetness went down. I asked someone to repair the fire and treat it with vegetarian medicine. The small hole was healed immediately. Unexpectedly, in mid-winter, the same disease occurred on the yin side of his right arm. At the same time, it was also on the ankle. I ignored it, and ate meat as usual, and did not repair the fire. After delaying for half a month, the small hole suddenly healed, and the damp poison went up, and it started to fester, making it difficult to move an inch. For four months, the pain has been unbearable. I would like to ask what medicine is most suitable for treatment?</p>
<p>Dr. Tang Renjin answers: It is best to test the blood once to prove whether there is syphilis, and it is necessary to check whether there is a cause of tuberculosis before determining the treatment plan.</p>
<p>Chen Jianchang asks: I have been suffering from erysipelas for four years. In the beginning, it occurred once a year. In the first half of last year, it recurred once a month. Recently, it has not recurred for more than half a year. I don't know what will happen in the future? My feet are currently swollen. I would like to ask what medicine can be used to reduce the swelling?</p>
<p>Dr. Tang Renjin answers: The medical name for erysipelas is erysipelas. Sulfa preparations can be taken or injected during recurrence. Locally, Iktol ointment can be applied, or magnesium sulfate wet compress can be used. Such treatment can reduce recurrence, but the swelling caused by repeated attacks subsides very slowly.</p>
<h3>Seeking Traces</h3>
<p>Seeking my cousin, Ma Zhaoxiang, from Jiangying Town, Yancheng. He graduated from Nanjing Army University in June of the 26th year (of the Republic, likely 1937) and returned home to get married. Coinciding with the July 7th Anti-Japanese War, he received a telegram from the university instructing him to go to Nanjing. Since leaving home, there has been no news. It is said that when the capital fell, the Japanese invaders searched the city, and Ma jumped from the city wall, was injured, and died. It is also said that he moved west with the capital; his life or death is unknown. I pray that Ma's classmates or my senior generals, if they know his whereabouts, will kindly inform Mr. Zhao Haoran of the Wuxian Police Station for transmission to Zhao Yusan; I would be grateful.</p>
<p>Seeking Shi Wenguang, styled Cangzhou, from Wuxian. In the 26th year (likely 1937), he was ordered to retreat west.

It was not until the year before last that he sent a letter home, saying that he lived at Xu Xietai Store, Yin Jiahe, Huang'an County, Hubei, forwarding through Ye Qikai, Lu Fan, Bajiaomiao. Several letters were exchanged. After the victory, news has been scarce for a long time. I do not know where he resides, or which unit he serves in. If relatives or friends know his whereabouts, please send a letter to Teng Kuilin, Yuan Taichang Southern Goods Store, No. 2057 Yangshupu Road, Shanghai.</p>
<p>Seeking my brother, Zhao Xiangchang, from Zhenjiang. Formerly studied at Nanjing Qixia Rural Normal School. After the war, he followed the army to Hengyang and other places. In the 32nd year (likely 1943), it was known that he worked in the Political Training Class of the 3rd Battalion, 30th Regiment, 10th Reserve Division of the 10th Army (Division Commander Fang Xianjue). Later he transferred to flight school in India for training. Since the victory, there has been no news. If benevolent people can provide information, I would be grateful beyond measure.
