<p>〔本報北平十七日電〕東北問題正以超速度演進中，華北人民對於頻發之衝突，大多預感其不祥之發展，共方則以東北衝突日漸惡化，作為積極破壞交通之理由，人民正以待救之心情，注意馬歇爾元帥之動向。白崇禧氏與其將長國防部消息，同時到平，今日轉往東北，一般推測，白氏此行將使今後數週之東北軍事及整個局勢皆可有相當影響。四平街困戰四週，公主　之共軍傅達十萬，表面形成和戰關鏞之長春，在「民主聯軍」策動下，正加速其對解決東北問題之影響。平中共人士以我們不說大話的傲然態度，表示其阻止國軍確有信心。根據甫抵北平之某「中間人士」看法，共軍攻佔長春，似屬不暢，蓋此舉頗影響美國保守派對中共這音法，甚至使馬歇爾同情政府必須收復長春。該氏並稱：「民主聯軍」一環之周保中等，是否完全接受中共中央指導，周恩來亦無自信，蓋周保中等認為中共所討之價錢尚低也。而周恩來亦曾親向其此中間人士表示，解決問題，應以解決當前問題之客觀務任為轉移，最近中央復提出整軍之五比一方案，即一證明。最後該氏根據一般觀察之看法，謂東北停戰仍將在最近或月內獲得協議。</p>
<p>〔中央社藩陽十七日電〕白副總長崇禧，偕政治部李　長後龍等，十七日下午四時半由平飛抵瀋，熊主任，杜長官等百餘人往迎。白氏在招待所與熊主任晤談，並接見杜長官，徐主席，董巿長等，詢問各情。記者往訪，詢蒞瀋任務，承告謂：數月來在津浦·平漢·隴海各綫及青·濟等處視察部隊整訓情形，大致竣事，今特來東北視察，凡國軍所在地，均擬前往巡視。記者詢以東北接防問題，承答稱：共軍不遵守停戰協定，攻擊國軍，阻止接防，實為最大憾事，尤其共軍整編情形，從未呈報，至望中共早日覺悟，尤其東北共軍，藉民主聯盟軍等名義，阻撓國軍接收主權。記者復詢馬帥提議共軍應退出長春問題，白氏稱：中共迄無答覆。白氏嗣謂：關內各地國軍，均遵照命令整編，第一期計劃竣事，訓練工作亦極有進步。</p>
<p>〔合眾社南京十七日〕接近政府方面人士今晚宣布：國軍精銳部隊已抵四平街北方，現在完全將該城包圍。目下種種徵象，顯示國軍將在下星期中向四平街及長春發動總攻擊。</p>
<p>〔合眾社北平十七日電〕政府方面人士今日引「可靠方面」消息稱：被蘇軍俘獲後，自長春運走之日軍十三萬人，現已返抵哈爾濱，並逐漸被送往南方協助共衛軍作戰。此等人士並謂：在四平街東南之共產軍第一及第二師中，有日本鐵路工人八十人及日本官兵約一百八十人，當共產軍於上月間佔領長春時，曾有日本人與朝鮮人一千名以上，參與作戰。</p>

<p>〔本報南京十七日電〕中共代表董必武抵京後，昨晚及今晨曾與邵力子兩度晤談，今日下午董氏曾偕中共宣傅負責人陸定一趨訪內政部長張厲生，談一時許。周恩來於上午十時往訪馬歇爾特使，會談二小時半，至十二時三十分始辭出。聞今日中共代表周恩來，董必武分別與邵力子，張厲生及馬歇爾特使談話之結果，相當圓滿。據接近政府與中共代表者談，如在綜合小組會議舉行之前不再發生枝節問題，使綜合小組會議得於寗靜和諧之氣氛中順利進行，使解決爭端之方式，先以政治商談，俟當事人對當前局勢有充分明瞭與研究之機會，此於未來之軍事調處，至為有利。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京十七日電〕川省府主席兼代重慶行營主任張羣，昨深夜由渝飛抵京，張氏十七日上午晉謁蔣主席。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十七日電〕杜　門總統對記者稱：馬歇爾特使在華使命並未失敗，外傅馬氏斡旋國共合作未成，總統對此不願表示意見，僅謂：馬氏在華如有進行其任務之可能，自常留駐任所。</p>

<p>〔本報南京十七日電〕今日下午五時，京各報記者及上海各大報駐京記者十六人，於歡迎于院長後，相偕至梅園新村十七號中共辦事處，訪問周恩來，時周因要公待理未見，由中共代表團秘書長齊燮銘代見，各記者曾提出下列二問題，請齊轉達，（一）周恩來先生與政府代表及柯義上校蘇北之行，何日啓程，能否給京滬記者以隨同至蘇北觀光之便利？（二）周恩來先生連日與政府代表曁馬使會談之結果，可否見告，當荷齊氏上樓轉達，約二分鐘後，齊復下樓代答，（一）蘇北淮陰之行仍未定，一旦實行，當歡迎記者前往參觀。（二）周先生確已與各方進行商談，但現尚無以為告，容改日答復，各記者乃悵然辭出。適董必武，陸定一驅　返，諸記者遂趨與寒暄，並分回董·陸二人探詢消息，董答：渠甫由渝來，諸事茫然，所可奉告者，（一）軍事，東北須無條件停戰，（二）政治，由政協小組會議解決。嗣董·陸復應諸記者之請，相偕重入室內，答復諸記者之詢問，大意為（一）綜合小組會議，確擬俟民盟及青年黨代表來京後即舉行，（二）民盟四代表十八日來京，（三）周恩來先生蘇北之行，因政府認目前無此需要，已作罷。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十七日電〕董必武，陸　一於答覆記者詢問中之「對報載長春共軍與偽滿傀儡軍官及匪首合流，組織所謂自治政府是否滿意」一點，謂渠等尚無所知，並謂，中共辦事處亦不甚明瞭此事，延安比較清楚，現長春局面之極度混亂，可以想見。</p>

<p>— 本報特約記者　邵愼之</p>
<p>這是本報特約記者邵愼之親身經歷了長春變亂，而被拘留在長春廿九天所見所聞的一篇忠實報道。全文共五萬字，將陸續由瀋陽寄來發表。</p>
<p>長春之變是一塲激烈的戰爭。</p>
<p>我們在四月九日自瀋陽飛到長春，十三日復有美記者五人飛來，一同身受目擊中國內戰的慘景。我們每個人都隨時有被砲火呑食的危險，但我們看到砲火激烈之中房屋被焚，民眾死亡，而民眾代表們奔走呼籲停戰，痛哭流涕的情形，心衷難過極了：我們忘却所處的長春是一個危險的地帶，而深切感到這是一個人性迸發的地帶。</p>
<p>我們在長春廿九天，這一時期的工作，現在領直不敢回想。但我們必須把我們的經騐發表，使中國以及世界對東北問題增加一點參考資料。我們雖曾失去自由，但因為我們是中國人，不願意以這樣的遭遇，來挑起各種不利和平的反響，也並不想指摘任何一方面，或者任何一個人的過失。只預備把經歷記載不來，供獻給關心中　和平的朋友，以及遭受着苦難的中國人民，讓他們共同來批評。我們是職業記者，我們愛護，我們的獨立性，同時也希望讀者們能够尊重我們的立塲。</p>
<p>一塲大戰　送別卡爾洛夫</p>
<p>蘇軍在十四日完全撤出長春的消息，董彥平在六日從長春飛瀋陽時就帶給了我們，七日蘇軍開始撤退，十三日只剩二百來人，十四日晨卡爾諾夫最後離開，長春的形勢，遂急轉直下。</p>
<p>董彥平和馬林諾夫斯基曾經相互通知，當他們離開長春之後，長春軍事方面責任，董指定出行營高參陳家珍小負責，他是軍事代表團團員之一，馬則指定由卡爾諾夫負責。他們連日接觸，都是普通的晤面，陳原定在十四日給卡餞行，但卡決定在十時（蘇聯時間十二時）乘火車離開長春，於是作戰。</p>
<p>十四日上午九時，陳家珍，張大同，孔秘書都到車站去送行，這是一個外交塲面我們當然不能放棄，也一同坐車到車站。我們從滿炭大樓出來，驅車轉到外交特派員公署，約五位美國同業一起去，中央社劉竹舟有一輛汽車，行營給我們一輛吉普，十一個人分開乘坐，趕到車站，經過舊協和會館蘇軍司令部門口，這才看到崗位撤去，消無聲息，但是我們心頭鄭重，因西飛機塲那邊，已經有共軍進攻，上午三時就開始接觸。一方面送別卡爾諾夫，一方面擔心着未來的局面，因為蘇軍一撤，長春立刻開始陷在戰爭中，這是已經預料所及的，所以送別卡爾諾夫，覺得有說不出的滋味。</p>
<p>我們走進車站，專車還沒有掛到，陳卡正在月台晤談，孔擔任翻譯，並且介紹我們和卡見面。孔說還有幾位美國記者，是不是願意和他們談談，卡爾諾夫面向月台外面，連正眼也不瞧一下，忙搖頭說：不。於是他們便被撇在一這旁，只好冷清清的在月台上踱步，好像都是待車的旅客，互相不打招呼，各人只和自己的旅伴談天，雖然卡是和他們中幾位是曾經認識的。卡爾諾夫站得無聊，也提議踱步，邊走邊談。東問道：·「長春蘇軍現在已散完了嗎？」</p>
<p>「不，還有兩三個人，因為趕不及車，恐怕今天還留在長春」。卡答。</p>
<p>等到車子二開進站，卡和他的隨從人員，立刻跳上去，並日讓送行的客人走進去。</p>
<p>在公事車裏的潔白桌布上，已經準備好了伏特加和啤酒，俄國冷凍，醃肉，甜菜。太家一齊舉杯，表示惜別，互祝健康，並為中蘇永久堅固的友誼乾杯。</p>
<p>卡爾諾夫向記者們舉杯說：「我希望中蘇人民的友誼，能够永遠堅固，希望你們把這個意思轉達給讀者」。</p>
<p>車廂地位狹小，　送別者和被送別的人，都站在那裏，擠在一起，左手持　，右手舉杯，如是者約十分鐘，這才一一和卡握手告別。</p>
<p>車子向東開，送行者，包括十來個蘇僑在內，也悄然離開車站。車站空虛極了，沒有旅客，沒有站夫。陳家珍跳上車子就趕回中央銀行防守司令部，竹舟也趕回社內佈置戰時準備。</p>
<p>就在這個時候，長春的正副防守司令東家珍和劉德　正式發表：所有汽車都貼上寫着「長春防守」四字的紙條，加蓋司令部的印，我們都領到了特別進行　。</p>
<p>就在這個時候，長春的戰事，就激烈展開，我們開始在砲火下過生活。（未完）</p>

<p>「中國饑餓上海跳舞」！這句話出於外國新聞記者之口，是我們中國人，特別是上海人的恥辱！成千百萬人在中國的任何角落，自西北，華北，華中以至華南，天天在死亡綫上掙扎，而在上海却紙醉金迷，奢侈豪華，漫無止境。這是個極慚愧的對照！我們呼籲「聯總」要求救濟，我們呼籲國外要求協助，而我們自己竟有一部分人在上海的生活却如此浪費，反躬目問，那個不應該愧死？美國是生產最發達富力最雄厚的國家，人民崇尚自由，現在對日作戰勝利給束，世界大戰亦已終了，照理應該可以恢復到戰前生活的享受，然而他們却依舊未能得到生活享受上的滿足，戰時的物資配給和物價統制的辦法到如今大都依舊在施行。英國亦是個生產發達的國家，然而英國人民依舊過着與戰時相同的生活，一切物資厲行統制配給；打了五年多的仗，將希特勒日本軍閥打倒了，英國人依舊過着戰時的生活，講不到喘息的機會和生活的享受。獨有我們這個生產落後的國家，却要講生活上的享受而不知刻苦厲行節約，這是我們民族的恥辱！蔣主席看到這一點，對於生活上的應該厲行節約，曾經三令五申，即行政院最近亦有公務員厲行節約的決議。可是政府儘管三令五申，而寶際收效往往不能如預期的理想，風氣所播，以致國民生活的奢侈糜爛，近月變本加厲。面對着當前的頹風，我們要喚起國人的正義感和責任感，趕快脚踏實地厲行節約，為國家民族保留一些元氣。</p>
<p>節約運動的提倡，不自今日始，為了要脚踏實地厲行節約，使節約能生宏效，我們不得不坦白地指陳：這運動如欲期其成功，不在政府管制的嚴厲，而在人民自動的遵行。政府雖然可以一紙命令，限制食品的消費，或規定若干行為的禁止，如飲酒跳舞等事，但這些命令的發布，未必能收節約的實效，相反地或使生活更趨奢侈。過去節約運動的收效不宏，主要由於若干人士以為政府可以憑一紙命令來限制人民的行為，殊不知人民倘使沒有自覺，政府的命令儘管嚴厲，反而招致弊端百出，養成普徧作偽的陋習。公開跳舞縱可禁止，變相的營業跳舞却未能禁絕，餐館縱有不能聚飲的明令，而家庭酬酢之風仍必無法遏止。儿此所為，從使人趨向作偽欺騙，與主席所提倡的新生活運動背道而馳。我們今天提出厲行節約此應其時的呼號，固有望於政府能够將此項運動推進起來，但更希望政府當局對於命令的頒布要適如其分。與其立法從嚴，執行從寬，自不如立法從寬，執行惟嚴。明知其不方為而為之，必將招致不良結果。凡有禁令，務必入情入理，方能期其收效。舉個例來說，上海是國際都市，我們如果為了節約而絕對禁舞禁酒，不特　笑友邦，從將增加作偽犯法的機會。今日一切應作應為的事，我們要喚醒人民，本着良知良能，自動奮發起來實行，一傳十，十傳百，不愁不能改造社會的風氣。</p>
<p>不合理的消費，應該在別方面尋求制止之方。我們不明白在政府厲行節約的今日，為什麼市面上充斥了國外輸入的不必要的商品如紙烟洋酒水果之類。我們不也有自製的烟酒和自產的水果，這些不必要的商品何以在自今這種時候却有大量的輸入？政府如果有厲行節約的決心，應該運用關稅政策，對於不必要商品的進口嚴加取締。此項不必要商品的輪入，一方面斵傷了我們自己落後了的生產界，一方面却促使一般人民奢侈習慣的養成。厲行節約，在消極方面，莫要於關稅政策的運用，使不必要的洋貨無法輸入，或輸入了而價格奇昂，使人無法問津，以遏止奢侈的頹風。</p>
<p>可是厲行節約，積極方面的舉措，究較消極方面的舉措更為重要。積極方面的舉措，全在人民能够自覺自動起而節約。飯廳舞場，茶樓酒肆，與其由政府來規定禁約，不如由社會各界，自動起米約法三章，相互遵守。上海的行會組織較為完善，當此厲行節約之際，尤應率先倡導，議定厲行節約辦法，各自恪遵奉行。我們要鼓勵大家比賽節約，糾正競賽奢華的虛榮觀念。我們要養成誰節約誰就光榮的風氣。這樣，政府可以少發一些禁令，而人民在遵守奉行上，或較政府的禁令更為有效。我們希望上海的各行會組織，各社會團體，能够不待政府的命令，自動地起來推行節約運動。一般市民，尤應仰體國步艱難，對於種種節約決定，各本至誠，切實遵守。大家同心同德，然後　運動機能達到目的。我們於此，要喚起每個市民對於厲行節約的責任感，正是大家分內所應為的事。</p>
<p>且今全國正在積極展開節約運動，上海為中國第一都市，又當新市長即將蒞任之初，我們要積極展開節約運動，為上海的新市政作先鋒，為全國的節約運動樹模楷，以雪百年以來十里洋場被稱為「罪惡淵藪〕的恥辱。願上海市民大家起米厲行節約！</p>

<p>〔路透社倫敦十七日電〕此間權威方面息：英政府發表之印度自治方案，並不限定期限，令印度接受。據悉，印度總督魏菲爾業已與印度領袖開始會商，謀設立全由印人組織之政府。又據新德里消息，甘地昨曾在祈禱會中表示，英政府宣布之方案，為印度史上重大之舉，值得仔細之研究。故希舉羣眾保持鎮靜，勿受極端份子之誘惑。回教同盟會長真納現在新德里，大概今日亦可發表申明。英政府宣布之方案，支持印度之統一，反對真納所提回印分治，建立回教獨立國之要求。因此種要求不足以解決少數民族問題，更因其地位處於東北及西北邊防要害，故已由英閣代表團予以拒絕。回教同盟倫敦支會長阿里已表示此項方案，不啻出賣印度之回教徒，渠擬於六月二日在倫敦召開民眾大會，表示抗議。</p>

<p>〔路透社倫敦十七日電〕英政府之白皮書，昨同時在倫敦及新德里發表，此乃英政府使印度完成獨立之最大努力，為任何帝國史上空前之舉。艾德禮首相昨在下院宣讀白皮書時，邱吉爾稱之為「新局勢」，足以代表工黨之「新帝國政策」。然不論各方面之指摘如何，英國之立場，仍為「印度人應</p>
<p>自行團結　自設制憲機構，制定憲法」，目前之問題乃回教徒或印度教徒是否願意接受。此次宣布之綱領，建議設立印度聯邦政府，處理外交國防交通事務，而各省得劃為回印兩區，此項計劃與真納之要求相去猶遠，自不能使其滿意。真納今有兩途可循，非為按受英方建議或類似該建議之辦法，即為內戰。就印度教徒方面言，英國之建議雖近似國大黨之要求，然亦有為彼等所反對者，例如回教省之自治，依民族劃分省區，使居民有選擇之權，在全印制憲議會成立以前，設立分離之制憲會等。英國之建議，在無從妥協之書面下，已</p>
<p>盡其所能　使雙力之得失相等，至於贊成印度之統一，此乃自然之結果。白皮書開端即謂僅回教徒反對統一，然贊成統一，即不免推　四印分治之原則，故結果仍不能解決印度之民族問題。白皮書中所建議者為成立印度聯邦，具有行政與立法兩機構，前者處理印度全境包括各王公統治之邦之外交，國防交通事宜，其餘各項權力則歸各省汝各邦自理，各省得依其居民之種族信仰，而組織行政及立法機構，每分區得決定該省共同之施政。關於</p>
<p>制憲問題　每居民一百萬人得推選代表一名，選出之後再分成回教·西卡族·及一般等三派，全部省區亦分為三組，第一組為各印度教徒省區，其餘二組為西北及東部之回教徒區。惟全印制憲議會二九二席中，二一〇席應屬諸一般代表，七八席屬諸回教代表，四席屬諸西卡族代表，此外各部至多可選出九十三席。該三組先行分別開會，然後再以聯邦制憲議會之立場，制立自由印度之最後憲法。白皮書最後復提出警告，申言若不接受此項辦法，即將發生動亂，甚至內戰，故乙求印人接受獨立。據悉，白皮書在數星期內不致提付辯論，惟各黨領袖將於今日發言。</p>

<p>英美法蘇四國外長，自上月廿五日在巴黎開會以來，到昨天休會為止，實實足足開了三個星期的會。在這廿一天之內，四國外長討論戰後歐洲的幾個重要問題，不知化了多少唇舌和心血；但是因為各國利害不同，意見各異，竟討論不出一點結果。不僅是四國外長唇焦舌敝，徒勞無功，而且使全世界熱望戰後各國合作共維和平的人們大失所望。</p>
<p>在這次國國外長會議中，最值得我們注意的是美國國務卿貝爾　斯的努力。他抱了「不許失敗祇許成功」的態度，到巴黎去開會，不惜委曲求全，對於任何重要問題，無不一再提出妥協方案，但依舊挽回不轉外長會議的厄運。從這裏，也可以看出國際間的矛盾，根深蒂固，恐怕不是輕易可以消除的了。</p>
<p>平心而論，這次外長會議的失敗，也早在意料之中。在它開幕的一天起，我們根本就沒有什麼奢望。因為自從大戰結束之後，國際上橫一個會議，豎一個會議，有的讓而不決，有的決而不行，把我們對於國際會議的興趣，早已冲淡。不過看到這次四國外長會議閉幕的匆忙，及其草草了事的情形，究不能不表示詫異。</p>
<p>當四國外長會議通過美國提出休會一月的建議之後，連外次會議的日期也沒有定，連德國問題特別委員會的委員也沒有派定，四國外長便一同到盧森堡宮富麗堂皇的酒排間去痛飲一杯，借酒澆愁，聊以减輕他們心頭的苦悶。這是外交史上所罕見的怪現象！所以這次外長會議的失敗，以視去年九月間在倫敦舉行五國外長會議的不歡而散，有過之而無不及。</p>
<p>外長會議休會一月後，到下月十五日，還要再開。前途如何，誰也不能逆料。不過歐洲政治陷於僵局，長此拖延下去，終非世界人類之福，殆可斷言。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕在全國佈滿了陰霾的時候，郵政也遭遇到分割的命運。不過，經當局的努力和委曲求全，總算局部已開始「交換性」的通郵。但得鄭重聲明的，這並不是說就是承認了印有毛澤東像的郵票，而是顧慮到人民負担，使他們免去一筆欠資和罰款罷了。</p>
<p>停戰協定並不能停止共軍的前進，所以最近上海郵政總局管轄區內的啓東，東安鎭，久隆鎭，北新鎭，三陽鎭，麒麟鎭六個局，又相繼被佔領去了。同時「蘇院邊區政府交通局」印製的毛澤東像的郵票，也迅速地從那裏傅遞到上海來。</p>
<p>此項郵票分（便）（機）（印）三種，印在上邊綫的中央，這三個字就是代表普通信，航空信，和印刷品，此外還有牽牛郵票，下面印着英文譯出來恐怕就是「蘇中」兩字，通用票面為五分一角，（係共黨所發之抗幣，非普通國幣）普通一封信，僅需郵資兩欠，但不要小看這區兩角之數，有時他的彈性會超過你現在一封快信應付的代價呢！</p>
<p>據悉：華北若干區域也同樣已實行通郵，在河北省中部並准許我們的綠衣使者自由通過共軍封鎖綫投遞信件，惟須經過一次「檢查」手續，因此郵局方面，凡接受寄往共軍區域的郵件，僅限於平信一種。（圖示黨所發之郵票）</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕轟動一時之電影明星袁美雲吸毒案，已於昨日審理終結，由連震邦推事當庭宣判，處有期徒刑六月，褫奪公權一年。袁聞判後，以手帕掩面，輕聲哭泣，狀至凄慘，旁聽席中，亦時間同情者之喟嘆，其母更哀哭不已。</p>
<p>昨日下午二時半，法庭已被旁聽者塞滿，窗口亦擠浦男女，袁即在眾目睽睽中，由張驥，潘祝鵬二司法警官帶入被告席內。袁穿玄色旗袍，著黃色絲襪，足登半高跟黃白色皮鞋，髪甚蓬亂，右角插白花別針，而臉色蒼白，面容消廋，鼻上所架白邊太陽眼常低首而泣，並竭力避免攝影記者拍照。經連推事訊問一過，乃傅訊證人曹之綬醫師，曹為袁父之學生，素與袁相熟。據稱：袁於去年十二月廿四日起戒烟，於今年二月十四日已式絕。嗣即開始辯論，樂後偉律師稱：被告烟已戒絕，警局以被告所食胃病藥水，强認為戒烟華水，拘捕法辦，顯欲以被告之電影明星頭銜，作為禁烟運動之宣傅，於理於情，殊不相宜。黃孟剛律師稱：被告旣無犯罪之行為，又無吸食之行為，法醫以臉色斷定吸烟，而不以正當之方法，根據小便，頭部，手指，及生理變態檢騐烟癮，殊不得當，應請複騐，卒為庭上拒絕。最後，被告聲稱：家有老母幼弟，賴姬為生，此次　　，已喪失其名譽與前途，故請判無罪，並先交保，遼陽身體。連推事不准其請，即行宣判，並解釋稱：「只要你有決心戒絕，當可不所處之刑。」一代影星，乃於熱淚盈眶，泣不成聲中，被押人地院封設之女子監獄內。</p>

<p>商業新聞米價愈抬愈高　白粳迫近六萬　　米市塲交易越軌　棧單竟當皮球踢　　昨日米市銷化甚活，店方紛紛購納，粳米迫近六萬大關，較前日猛漲三千餘元，秈元飛升四千有奇，當此洋米絡續成定之中，而米價反連漲不已，漲勢之銳，高入雲際，殊屬出人意料。　　昨日米市塲中，並且發現非法交易，除現貨交易外，頗多以棧單當皮球踢者，因此米糧市價愈抬愈高，按米市塲管理委員會原規定同業交易，一律限於現貨，今竟有棧單交易，米市投機之風，槪可想見，鬦主管當局將採取相當措置以期制止。　　麵粉亦隨米價上漲五六百元，油市因各物上勝，亦漲二千餘元，豆餅帶挺二三百元，　皮仍然平正，生仁彷彿，芝蔴定局，紅糧依然平庸，苞米靑島略進，人心甚堅，回升千元，昨日本市到米，據米市塲息，共四千餘石，其種類及石數如下：白粳一〇七五石，羊秈六五石，薄稻四五三石，杜秈三三三石，早稻一一九〇石，蕪秈一五〇石，皖秈五五石。川米運輸　積極進行　　〔本報訊〕際茲一般物價平穩聲中，而米價克愈演愈劣，日陞三四千。昨日米市塲常錫白粳，已飛升至五萬八千元之新高價。米店門市供售者，有高達六萬二千元者。記者曾連訪糧政當局，各米商，及輪運常局。各該方面對日來米價之一再騰漲，均感費解。旋又趨訪承運川米之民生及招商兩輪船當局，叩詢運輸川米二百萬担之情况。據悉：民生公司爲運輸川米，已出動全部川江船二十艘左右，此外尙擬設法利用新購之登陸艇廿艘。蓋最近該項登陸艇，己由漢尼許船主自宜昌至重慶，再自重慶至漢口一帶航行成功。現正訓練大批船員，以便駕駛，招商局方面，則將撥、江慶（一百六十噸）及江和（四百五十噸）兩艘，協助運米。江慶現在重慶，江和則將於十八日自滬駛渝，大致月底可到。據聞糧部託運之川米二百萬担，的合十五萬噸，擬先分運漢口南京各半，再在該兩地統籌分配其他各地。預計該批船隻，月能運米一萬噸。運費照原定價打七折，大致到漢口每噸取費十萬零九千元，到上海則需十四萬七千元云　　又據招商局訊：九江安慶湖口三區，最近將有食米五千噸，由該局派輪分運京滬兩地。該局江黔號，已于日前運米二千八百噸至南京。茶市轉入盤檔　芽茶銷路尚活　　脫手久鮮順利之芽茶，邇來本街店莊及蘇州無錫等地，覽於價格尙能合胃，紛起採辦，尤以台灣芽茶扒吸更多，而寗州貨成交亦不少，至於溫州新旗槍，在述日傾向下趨以來，持者已不忍再度貶售，市氣止疲轉平，其他花色，過程大致與上日相仿。川南喜雨　米價下落　　〔中央社重慶十七日電〕川南各地，自十三日夜起大雨，至十四日夜始霽。春耕雨水已足，糧價頓挫。內江安等地，十三日前，白米每石一萬六千餘元，現已跌至一萬二千五左右。濾縣自流井兩地雨後，中熟米亦自一萬七千餘跌至一萬六千以下，一般焦慮之川南旱荒，將不至成爲事實。公債續跌　　公債業中人不加支持，市氣較爲散漫，統丙自七一五〇元，開後陸續盤跌至六六〇〇元，而後略定，午刻在六六五〇元左右掙扎，結果較前收續跌四五〇元，甲乙亦跌二五〇元，丁種降三百元，戊種跌四百元。食無魚　三輪車爭運　魚市塲停頓　　本市楊樹浦魚市塲之魚鮮海味，已往係由行販僱三輪車，於每日淸晨裝運至市區各菜市出售，近以汽油進口，行販多改用卡車裝運，由楊樹浦魚市塲裝運魚鮮至市區菜塲，三輪車裝運費每件爲二千元，卡車裝運每件僅需一千元，且遝輸時間較速，因之三輪車夫無法與卡車競爭營業，常發生爭吵，日前雙方發生毆鬥，至今尙未解決，據悉是項裝運魚鮮之三輪車夫的有五百餘人，昨晨三時許，結集於魚市塲左近各馬路，臥地不起，以阻攔各車通過，故今日魚市塲之魚鮮，均無法運出，而各菜塲亦無魚應市，因之鮮肉及蔬菜商乘機抬價，鮮肉每市斤開價有二千元一斤者，其他蔬菜市價，亦均任意抬高，一般食戶無不叫苦。證券帮游資回籠　金價趨勢堅穩　美鈔較前挫十元　　烚赤昨人心頑抗不已，趨勢繼　向榮，晨開微挫，浮多見勢不　，一度了結，開後自一八〇萬小挫至一七六萬，證券帮游資重返懷抱，得以支持，十時左右在一七九萬內外徘徊，中行配給同業一二五條，價升爲一七九萬，以致配售竣事後，買意復濃，銀錢業亦有搜購，遂穿出一八〇萬外，惟雖漲而多盤，午刻漲到一八三萬而後稍平，午後形勢平穩，盤旋之餘，結果較前收無甚出入，飾金掛升少許爲十九萬四，紋銀一千七，銀元仍穩，暗拆銀根仍鬆，喑拆初緊後鬆，息價白一角八退至一角半，業外尙多需用，息價仍站二角左右。　　外幣美鈔悄况漸緊，晨開二三四〇元有賣，曾退至二二九〇元，金市重俏，午刻復盤升至二三三〇元左右徘徊，午後穩後稍回，結果較前收微挫十元，港票中途見秀，結果尙平，港匯自四二〇元升至四五元，羅比五二五元，均有供給，美匯仍平，銀行對做仍高於掛牌少許。細紗貨缺價俏　現棉市況平庸　　昨日紗市粗平細俏，廿支及十六支紗雖稍喊高，然買戶缺少，成交不多，四十二支雙股及卅二支細紗，因貨根不多，織廠不斷叩求，同行扳俏，續升十萬之譜，津帮對廿支日光等略有選辦，粵漢兩帮仍取觀望態度，因各該地紗價均極不振也，午時紡建公司照例開紗，六支無牌紗，廿支雲鵬及卅二支藍鳳副牌，均較上期貶低四萬，四十二支立馬筒綫一反比上期之同支寳光高五萬，共　　布市受外貨充斥，客商需要平一常，市勢無大變動。　　花市紐約美棉報漲十一至卅二磅音，計近期美金二七·三〇，遠期二七六·九，米特林現貨二七·九一，本埠現棉市况平庸，常州民豐紗廠略有採辦，此外各廠全無談判云。煤柴炭源源運滬　燃料供應激增　　本市燃料問題自經關係當局積極整飭後，一般趨勢已大見改觀，（一）烟白煤斤運滬絡繹於途，並各產煤區亦經次第增加生產，本市煤業商人均次第恢復採辦工作，嗣後來源將益見增加，（二）機製煤球頃已完全恢復生產，總達六十餘家之多，（三）柴斤遝滬雖多，但去化狹隘，一般用戶多嫌價高，吸胃銳減，市價則原盤未更，　栗担四千八百元。難柴三千八百元，松段三千二百元，（四）木炭存底日增，大部來自海門溫州黃　浙東各地，來源蟬聯，市勢在疲途中徘徊。糖價在步漲中　　昨糖市趨勢依然堅緊，公會劃盤中砂白仍逐步上展，初爲六萬六千元，旋至六萬八千元而八千五百元，午收爲六萬九千元，下午六萬八千元至六萬八千五百元。比前日升千元，生砂五萬七千元，次色三半白六萬五千五百元，興化白開六萬四千元，次五萬八千五百元，刁靑高五萬元，次之四萬七八千元。下擋未成交。柏油銷塲清淡　　柏油近日因淘銷已將落令，致銷塲僅靠皂廠去路，然天時陰晴不常，製皂工作每多遲滯，且牛油椰子油存底單薄，不能專用柏油，所以各皂廠未能如往昔之儘量發展，柏油用塲亦爲之無形減少，市上雖有少數交易，不能引起興趣，致最近一月來市情幾無上落，各行售盤本車油五萬七八千元，內坪油四萬八千元，的十油四萬四千元，獨　四萬二千元，蘭油四萬元，麻城　三萬八千元。五金實銷甚少　　近日五金市情，定貨雖多而到貨甚少，且乏實銷，致無甚變動，建築品以房屋構造成本昻貴，房租收入不敷利息，興工者稀，市價亦也能見好，門鎖南洋幫有大批採辦往港轉運，一時市面稍秀，因存貨亦稀也。春繭貸款二百億元　用貼現方式由中蠶保證　五行局先墊放二十億元應急　　本年度蘇浙皖三省春繭貸款核定總額二百億元，組織銀團及貸款委員會，簽訂協議書，並爲應急起見，先由國行局墊放，其數爲總額十分之一，計二十億元，除由廠商籌繳三成「墊頭」，實放十四億元。由廠商開具本票，經中蠶公司背書擔保後，貼現十天，貼息四分五厘預扣，一俟銀團貸款放出，即行扣回。銀團放款，亦爲貼現方式，期限四個半月，利率四分五厘，（另加聯合管理處開支五厘（中蠶公司四厘，銀團一厘）實際上爲五分）先扣一個月，其餘三個半月之利息，分四期預付，即侮次預付一個月利息，末次預付半個月。由廠商分開遠期支票，一次繳存銀團，並由中蠶公司具函負責保證。　　浙江地方省銀行爲提倡生產，幷爲促進本省蠶絲業起見，援滬上商業行莊例，特撥十億元投資春繭貸款銀團，聞銀團方面已經議決接受云。拷膠，紋皮　美貨七月可到　　拷膠，紋皮，紐的方面，準於六月底裝船，七月底可到埠，紋皮滬地存底頗豐，兼之近來外帮久未來滬採購，故期貨定者寥寥。聞拷膠紐約定價爲每百磅美金十六元，（水脚關稅在外）紋皮價每張美金自五十至七十元不等工貸一覽　　總數達七十億元　　四行兩局所舉辦之復工貸款，截至本月十五日止，業經核定之數額爲六九九，五〇〇萬元，計一〇九戶，就中仍以紡織化工爲最多，茲訪錄其統計如次：　　業別　數（金額單位萬元）股市籌碼漸鬆　空頭聲勢較盛　　華股經大戶三開迎日猛力脫售後，籌碼復鬆，業中人頗多放空之流，過程遂少支持，開後雖見秀色，爲時至暫，永紗最高五三五〇元，美亞四四五〇元，景福三四五元，新光二九〇元，勤興二五五元後，逐漸下落，近午都見低價，冷門各股雖有帶小，爲數尙微，不若熱門之有空方加入也，結果較前收計永紗美亞景福各跌半成左右，新光勤興則跌一成弱，中型股亦續小挫，小型股則所小更微，元老股仍無生氣，空方聲勢漸盛，散戶目光轉移，趨勢恍惚，外股初平繼疲，買戶進後而復出，怡紗自一三四〇〇元跌至一二四〇〇元，英聯自一二二〇〇元跌至一一五〇〇元，而後稍定，結果各股除鋼業所跌尙微外，餘均下落半成至一成不等。美國取消絲綢管制　生絲八千包到美　　〔美國新聞處華盛頓十六日電〕美物價管理局五月十四日宣佈，繼生絲價格管制取消之後，舉凡絲綢織品，及純絲製之非衣服成品價格管制亦予取消。　　又電本週將有生絲約八千包，分裝三船運抵此間，據海港負責人稱，此批貨品爲遠東和平時期航運恢復以來，一日內貨品抵埠之最大批者，該批貨品將出一特別快車趕運至美國東部。經濟簡報　　成都路一一六弄元華烟廠，創辦於民國三十四年，總經理爲王章甫，現有出品計爲三貓脾，象牌，雙美牌等三種，資本一萬萬元現擬擴充，改組爲股份有限　　台灣肥料，極度缺乏，故台帮在滬大量搜購肥田粉。現滬市肥田粉，僅日貨雙喜牌一種，其他頗缺，江浙方面，現距施肥季節尙早，且躉戶競先出籠，故肥田粉雖在台帮搜購之下，價尚平穩。　　此間工業原料，各項熱門貨近日價格，多趨堅挺，原因爲金價之波動，加以外貨進口，遙遙無期，執貨者多不願出籠，蓋目前渝滬間船隻，尙在裝運還都人員及公物，據業中人云，一俟船隻暢通，外帮動銷，則各項原料，勢必飛揚。　　〔路透社瑪德里十七日電〕據美國商務部接獲報吿稱：西班牙燒碱（苛性鉀）生產前途，頗爲樂觀，一九四六年上半年該項燒碱之產量，倘能達於五五，〇〇〇噸時，即可超過去年同期產額之百分之十至三十。　　〔漢口十六日電〕武昌第一紗廠巳於今日正式復工，原有紗錠八八，〇〇〇錠中，先開工一萬錠，共用女工六〇〇人，其餘紗錠，不日即可續開云。</p>

<p>蘇北蘇南跳板：揚州風雲  十三日揚州通訊　王演　　如果記者的想像沒有錯，揚州在最近，人們對它相當關心。那是因為記者估計着了人們本身可能有這樣的想像：「楊州果再為共軍攻佔，蘇南蘇北勢將成立河山兩半壁了。」　　「五州主義」人心惶惶　這裏，記者首先要寄語竊心的人們：揚州無恙，而且看氣象，明天的明天也可保無恙。此間的人心一度曾惶惶不安是事實，推原其故，無非是受裏下河一帶流亡人們的影響，蓋流亡人們儘多驚弓之鳥，談起「解放區」來，就有把人聽得目臉口呆。　　當共軍揚言「五州主義」揚州。費州·通州·海州·徐州·志在必得，同時舉六　兵力，準備實行圍攻揚泰的那幾天，記者曾和國軍駐防揚城之第廿五軍一位曾經參加過長沙第三次會戰等大戰役的中級「兵官」談過。記者問：「楊州究竟有沒有問題？老百姓都很怕哩：」他道：「揚州決不會失給他的，你應該相信，高郵·賓應·興化等縣的失守，是因為我們沒有來得及按收。」轟轟烈烈地來，無甚聲息地去的「三人小組」，在揚州的那幾人，記者曾和忙於接待的此間地方協會的主持人，戴天球先生晤談，問：「這麼樣？三人小組有沒有制止共軍企圖的能力？」戴先生這樣答覆記者道：「就是沒甚結果，我想，楊州是蘇北蘇南的跳板，政府無論如何不會把揚州讓給他吧？」　　隨身帶錢以防萬一　舊貨寄售商店是揚州一種新興事業家數雖不多，大小也有十來家，今年新春前後，曾做了一批好生意。最近則不同了，寄售的東西日見其多，出錢來買東西的殊為稀少，這現象，說明了一個事實：人人都需要安排幾個錢在身上，以防萬一！　　「揚州浴室」是一個相當考究的浴室，上海先施公司後面的「浴德池，」座位雖算考究，但就整個構造而看却似乎沒有這裹的整齊。房間計分「洋盆，」「官盆，」「客盆」，普通座位計有「東特別間」，「西特別間」等。邇近，「客盆間」固常常缺少「盆客」，「特別間」也缺少「特別客」。　　三條中心市街上，（多子·左衛·轅門橋，）廣貨店「大減價」的做法一唱百和。擴音器幾乎是掛到街心來了，然而，生意依然清淡。　　錢業放拆高利盤剝　「放拆」是揚州「錢業」停頓以來的一種畸形產物。普通一元的拆息為一角，十天一計算，一月就是三角。以一百萬元做拆放交易，本利滾盤到第三個月就多出了一百萬元。最近物價未嘗大跳，且有下降者，做道種交易的人大為上算，相反的也就坑壞了「揹拆」的人。據談最近有些商店之亟謀「脫貨求財」，受時局威脅是原因之一。再一個原因就是「拆」太　不起了。　　揚州共有十三個城門。現在開放的，祗東關，西門，新北門，新南門，天寗門，福運門等。東門外這幾天最熱鬧，許多新近從「解放區」被解放出來的流民，因為無此間的「房住證，」便不獲入城。有再去住江南的，有的逗留在城外，設法進城，於是東門外變成了流民世界。　　戶口檢查不遺餘力　關於『居住證』，省方一度曾令此間縣府予以廢除的，事實却很困難，在防衛上，確保揚城的治安上，以及防止共軍混入城內潛居或蠢動，『居住證』的制度勢須有存在的必要。故駐軍第廿五軍方面為了這一層，堅持主張人民進出城，暫時仍須擁有『居住證。』　　同時，為防止奸人混入城，軍政當局對戶口查得很嚴。檢查時熊度，給民間的反應很好。　　提起揚州警察待遇，實在太苦了，每人每日祗有伙食費三百元，幾個月來，一直是如此。外表上，警士們總算還肯負責任，但不時聽到街頭常有「小拈拈」的不正當行為。希望揚州軍當局對於此一問題能予注意，幷亟謀有效的處置。　　瘦西湖畔游人不稀　最後，說到這兒的風景區——瘦西湖，每天，游人總還不算少，由天寗門起程至五亭橋來回，「大洋划」價二千元，「小洋劃」價一千元，「治春」「慶昇」茶社已開市。「香影廊」在粉飾中。「小金山」也有茶賣，蓮心寺裏的白塔已修葺過了。瘦西湖名勝之一：白塔蠶汎凄涼  湖州八日通訊　丁東　　立夏已過，不久春兩即將上市。今年蠶汛，即將成為尾聲，較早的蠶都已「大眠」，一星期以後，都要上簇作繭。浙江農民似乎可以稍稍喘氣，在這勝利後的第一個蠶汛，瘦得撈回成本的希望了。但據記者調查：今年「浙江蠶汛」實在凄慘。蠶種配售蠶戶未沾實惠　　一月前，桑葉已很肥大，而蠶種尚在渺茫中，不少農民急不暇擇，祇有飼養土蠶種。因為那時改良蠶種黑市價格是一萬兩千元，後來中蠶公司配售改良種二十萬張，但是發到鄉鎮公所，經過輾轉剝削，仍舊買到五六千元一張。配害蠶種，蠶戶並未獲得實惠，倒是養肥了鄉縝長。輯里湖絲迄今徒有其名　　蠶絲黃金時代，至少要上溯二三十年。遠自民國十年後，蠶絲外銷為日本絲所侵奪。八年抗戰，江浙兩省損失桑樹共計十萬萬株，欲圖恢復，祇少需要十年。湖州輯里從前以產絲聞名，現在絲廠雖有，但大半凋零，開工者寥寥。目前湖州掙扎中的蠶農，不過戰前的十分之一。杭·嘉·湖·三區人民，戰前有蠶戶八十萬戶，可以產一百萬担鮮繭，可以出三十萬疋綢，這數目雖然可觀，但比起全世界產絲量，却祇佔到三十分之一，而且前下落的程度，又是出人意料之外。可憐輯里湖絲，實已「徒有其名」而已。實施緊縮蠶戶不敢多養　　蠶農掙扎在生命的邊際。今年蠶戶都實施緊縮，養蠶都是省着桑葉做事，不敢多養一張半張。但蠶農因付出必要勞力所付的代價，在蠶兒未上簇前，已負債累累。農民銀行曾舉放小型貸款，但是手續麻煩，實非鄉農所能負擔。每戶貸款二萬元，還呈粥少僧多局面。而且暗中偷天換日，覺得放給農民，并無十分把握，利之所在，誰能擔保，他們不把鉅額資金偷偷地去做投機生意？行算有幸，若十蠶農貸到農民銀總的二萬元，但隨着重要簽一張賣身契，不准將鮮繭買給別人。含淚摘繭絲價不如紗布　　桑椹已呈紫黑，吃起來甜津津的。往年蠶花一起，總够鄕下姑娘添製新衣數襲，富裕的尚可買些脂粉，裝飾她們自己。今年蠶汛，一片凄涼，眼看繭價絲價，還不如紗布行情俏，蠶娘祇能含淚摘繭。鮮繭不能多放時間，烘灶不多，繭廠又少，幾個商人操縱了絲繭市場，鄉農的血汗怎能逃過這一番的壓榨？　　據說今年英美市場生絲價格較戰前增加五倍，上海價格較戰前還不到四千倍，如此說來絲廠可以賺錢，蠶農的命運却很可慮。但看外匯能否予以挽救而已。　　浙江農村危機如此嚴重，替「蠶汛」收場的湖絲阿姐也已到最後關頭。現在湖州做工的「湖絲阿姐」，每天自己帶飯上廠做工得工資七百元，這個數字還不够買二斤米。「湖絲阿姐」為生活所逼，現在再無風情可言。絲廠領工現在也愁眉苦臉，絲廠汽管也不饗亮，車台上積着灰塵了。讀者意見　規約　　（一）本訓絕對公開，文責自負，但切忌冗長，（二）切勿攻訐私人，切勿一稿爾投。（三）投稿人須寫明真實意見稿件，並須舉示真實姓名及住址，但發表時得用筆名。（四）本欄稿件概不致酬。（五）對來稿本報有刪節之權。（六）來稿披露與否，概不函復。（七）本報於必要時，得將來稿轉致有關機關參考。漢奸竟還有「威風」！　　編輯先生：請你把下面的一段事實，賜以登載，實為萬幸。抗戰是勝利了，一直到現在，收復的各省縣市，正在飄起　湧努力肅奸工作，給于一般昧心漢奸萬惡强盜國法的制裁。而我們浦東川沙却是例外，强盜漢奸還是穿着軍裝拿着武器威風凜凜正在大出風頭哩。川沙本來是魚米之鄉，富庶之區，在抗戰八年中遭受敵偽土匪的燒殺淫掠，真可說是空前絕後的浩刧。光是一縣裏，有偽興亞建國軍，偽保安隊，偽武裝警防團等組織，地方上束身自好的，都早已遠走高飛，純粹為國家打濟南愛護老百姓的可說半個也沒有。勝利以後，縣府裏的科長局長區長都是興亞軍的漢奸，仙們的法律只有二條：一條是吊起來灌冷水坐老虎凳，一條是拉出去活埋或槍斃。政府鞭長莫及，大員們多注視京滬綫各縣，消東好像是不層問聞的。直到本年一月，省方纔委了一位新縣長單　到任，被他探聽得明明白白，另一方面，奸匪們也打聽到新縣長來上任，早己籌備妥當，趁着新舊交替，官官相護，大家識相，皆大歡喜，還　了個兒女親家。不識相的民眾，祗曉得哭哭啼啼，拼命控告，當然得不到半點影響，還要聽憑漢奸大盜，誣陷良善，顛倒黑白。民眾沒有辦法，就向綏靖督導團聯名控訴，奉批川沙縣司法處直接審理。縣府票傳於四月十日開庭集訊，原告多遵傳到庭，被告一個沒有到，審訊正在進行，縣長竟親率衛隊前來勒令停止，結果無法進行，取消紀錄。照這樣下去，漢奸大盜當然感激得結草啣環，而打在十八層地獄底下的老百姓將是怎麼樣呢？司法獨立，法治國家，究竟是怎樣解釋呢？漢奸們究竟要辦不要辦呢？守康上。五，八。連環漫畫　　三毛從軍記（七）　張樂平作</p>

<p>出版界介紹幾本學習英語的刋物  安佩　　勝利以後，曾一度中斷的英語的學習，重又恢復了它過去的地位。英語的刊物又開始相繼在上海出現。現在把其中主要的幾種介紹如下，以便讀者的抉擇。　　（一）中華英文半月刋——這是戰前「中華英文週報」的後身，和週報一樣也分作初級和高級兩種。內容方面，初級的程度似乎太深，恐怕只有高中的學生才看得懂。至於在高級中，連　的長篇又太多，因此使難得買到一本的讀者莫明其妙。不過其中關於新語的介紹，頗値得參考。該刋並不在報攤零售，所以必須到中華書局才能買到。　　（二）。現代英語週刋——這是本　　年初從內地移上海出版的英語刋物，內容相當充實，并且幾篇關于翻譯及造名的文章，頗切實用。不過上一期登原文，下一期登譯文的辦法，因為隔時過久，恐怕不大為讀者所歡迎。況且，該刋雖名稱周刋，實際上要一個多月才出版一次。然而在學習英語的刋物中，還不失為比較嚴肅的一種。　　（三）實用英文——分中級和高級二種。中級是半月刋，高級是月刋，不過這也徒有其名，脫期已成為經常的現象。材料大部取自時事，所以該刋對於讀報頗有幫助。但因為泰半取材於上海的事件，所以對於內地讀者難免有隔膜之處。該刋所設的實習欄，對於練習寫作頗有益處。　　（四）現代英文——這本刋物往在容易和『現代英語週刋』纏錯。除了每期有一篇漢英對照的文字以外，差不多是全部英漢對照。英文大都是有趣的短文，通常每篇佔據一頁至二頁。每期連載的翻譯指南和會話英語，對於初學者頗有幫助。可惜該刋自去年十二月創刊以來，到現在只出到四期，脫期未免脫得太厲害了。　　（五）英華文摘——是戰前該刋的復刋，全部是英漢對照的雜誌文，適於高中以上的學生閱讀。不過譯文並不盡可靠，這大槪是由於美國雜誌文中俚語太多的緣故吧。　　（六）名著選譯月刋——藝文印書局出版，所以印刷够稱漂亮。這和「英華文摘」的性質相同，可是所選的原文較長，是很大的缺點。在他方面，原文的來源較文摘的方面爲多，是它的畏處。「人事問題」  聰雋　　著者：徐望之　　出版處：科學與文學社　　出版期：三十五年一月　　歐美各國，關於人事管理在社會上的應用，和職業指導已經處於同等重要的。地位隨着社會環境的日趨複雜，各種職業部門的人事問題，早引起很多人的注意。現在我國政府機關，和規模較大的實業機關，差不多都設有人事科，專門魚責管理人事上的各種問題。　　人事看起來好像很簡單，實際上到是極複雜的。眞正的人事管理，不僅是消極的管理便算盡其能事，主要的含有指導與改進人事活動的意義，牠和職業指導，有時也是聯貫的。如何能盡量發揮出人們的工作效率，如何能改善人們工作的方法，使人各盡其才，盡其用，都屬於人事的處理的範圍。關於專門研究人事問題的得，過去雖出版過不少，但好的却小多。最近讀到徐望之先生的「人事問題」，覺得頗有介紹給讀者諸君的必要。著者曾任中國銀行經理，他的書襲用他書的材料很少，大都是根據他服務經騐寫成。他所指示給我們的不是怎樣使自己獲得個人的滿足，而是從新建立起做人的基本要點。他認爲做人應該是直綫的，不是圓周的，做人應亟力避免時間精力及物力的浪費。書中提出許多人事上的重要問題來討論，從心理學的立塲與觀點，說明人與人之間應如何建立一個和諧的關係，特別强調一個人對於他的工作應如何貢獻出他最大的熱忱，如何負起他對事業的責任，如何適應繁複的工作環境。著者認爲中國的社會是情的社會，不是理的社會。理想的社會應該基於人類最健全的理智而發展，達到人事合理化的目標。本書雖僅薄薄百餘頁，但因行文的流暢，叙說的清晰，令人讀了，無板滯枯澀之弊。所討論的問題，都是以實際的經騐做出發點，很合于人事處理的實地應用。我覺得其中尤以「流的生命」「據點和影響圈」「人事聯繫的四因素」「浪費的人生」「領袖和領袖慾」「人事烟幕」和「女性對于人事的影響」幾個題目寫得最精采，例證是現實的，見解是新頴的。如果把這些問題當作人生修養問題來看，更有很大的價値。　　在各種常見的人事問題中，人事組織要算是最重要的了。著者本其工作經騐，提出人事組織應特別注意的幾點，更有獨到的見解，對於事務類別和程序活用所提供的意見很足爲工商機關採擇。教希望由這小書的啓示，引導人們去作進一步的人事問題的硏究。評民族女  黎光　沈蔚德著　正中書出版　　以抗戰故事作爲題材的文藝作品，不外乎兩種寫述的方法；一是以側面的方法米暴露陷區的黑暗，或者描畫後方的一種文化政治的鬥爭。一是直接寫述戰爭的情形或是游擊的結果。戰事發生以後，後方正面寫述抗戰故事的文藝作品很多，各地方劇塲所演出的也大都是這一類。但是正面寫述的作品太多，容易爲讀者所厭倦。所以也頗有用巧妙的方法以側面的方法來寫述的，其動人的效果，反而在前者以上。　　用正面方法來寫述抗戰的袖事，往往又都以男性爲中心。而女角常被當作愛情穿挿上的一個塲面。因爲幾千年來的積習，常將女子當作一種怯懦，退嬰的標記。以女性作爲主角而能賦予她以堅强的性格的，有『庵窟』中的孫大娘，和「民族女傑」中的孫四姑娘。　　「民族女傑」是一本長約六萬字的四幕劇，故事中叙述北方的某鎭上，孫四姑與她的丈夫史長興開設了一家酒店。夫妻的感情非常融洽，有一大，孫四姑回家去，半路上遇見了鬍子，想把她擄去，史長興沒法抵禦，這時恰巧金營長走過，將她搭救了。從此她瞧不起怯懦的丈夫，整天在外跟營長騎馬打槍。史長興失了幾年來心愛的妻子，心裏非常難過，曾幾次委曲求全地要求孫四姑再眷戀於他。幾次失望以後，他毅然離開了家，參加了軍隊。孫四姑在他丈夫走了以後，心裏很澳悔，於是一變以往的態度，閉門家居‘金營長幾次要求利他見面，都被拒絕了。這時中日戰事發生了，敵兵進佔這城鎭的時候，她爲了照顧病孩，沒有走脫，結果孩子被敵人拌死，而她也做了敵人的慰勞隊員。一年後，金營長又帶兵駐紥在附近的山鄉裏，她的了敵人的軍官來宴會，用藥酒將他們弄醉了。再通知金營長，於是我軍的飛機，和炸彈毀滅了他們的全部，也毀滅了孫四姑。　　在作者的叙言中，她寫述這故事的目的，是在刻　一個剛强的女性的面影的，全劇中孫四姑的率直與恣肆的口吻，一直保持到最後，即使有時被濃度的感情所重壓的時候，也沒有像一般女人樣流淚和消極的話。這一點，似乎已經達到了所者作要求的目的。但是在全劇的許多角色之中，竟沒有一個和他同樣堅强的人物，這使孫四姑變成了一個特出的性格，覺得有些不大妥當。金營長的性格的寫述，似乎不大够詳細。史長興在出走以後，已是變成一個台後的人物，他是否因爲參加了部隊而使他以往怯弱的性情有所轉變，作者也沒有提起。中國地理新講  顧晉琦　　賀湄著　實學書局出版　　地理書多半是枯燥的，裏面總是一連串的地名，山名，幾根交通綫，多少河流，還有某地某處出產些什麽，使人看了確實有些討厭。　　但是本書却沒有這樣的通病，它以最淺顯流暢的文字寫述着本國地理學上最基本的知識，所以祇要你稍有國文程度的話，準可以毫無困難的閱讀本書，這裏可以吿訴你，我國各地人口分佈的情形，重要的山脈和水系，地下的寳藏，工農業的概况等等。全書以講故事的方式，處處顧全讀者的興味，引人入勝，例如在人和水的一章中說：　　「長江不常泛濫，爲什麽呢？主要的是長江生了許多的瘤。　　「長江怎麼會生瘤的呢？當你把地圖翻開來一看，你就會明白，通到長江去的大大小小的湖沼，確實像個人的肢體上面所生的肉瘤呢。　　「這些湖是長江水量的天然調節器，岌天的時候，江水漲了，這些湖就容納了長江中過剩的水，把它送到附近低窪的地方去，到了冬天，江水淺了，這些湖便把它自己的水注到長江來。　　「這一類的湖，最大的有兩個，就是洞庭湖和鄱陽湖。」　　書中更介紹了在桂林附近發現的橡膠樹——呌做「大葉鹿角果」，這是一種三四丈長的多年生藤本植物。牠的幹。校。葉。果。都有乳漿，乳漿裏所含的樹膠成份達百分之四十至五十。　　鹿角果的乳漿，只要加水，就可以把橡膠的成份凝同起來，只要經過了短短的幾分鐘，並且只要在日光裏晒一下子，就可以製成生膠片。　　一棵大的鹿角果樹，可以製成二三斤的橡膠。　　鹿角果長得很快，牠分佈在廣西，雲南，廣東的南部和瓊州島，但是我們還不能知道那裏出產得最多。　　不過全書的缺點也很多，也許是限於篇幅的關係吧，新的材料可以說是沒有，并且有好多地方，自從抗戰勝利之後，已不再適用，同時全書因爲過於迎合通俗化的緣故，便寫得很散漫。這些都希望在再版時能予以適當的修正和補充。　　總之著者用了最平素簡易的文字，寫出一本絕不苦燥，使人容易記憶的地理書，這不能不說是一種新穎勇敢的嘗試，雖然書中不免有瑕疵互見的地方，但是作爲中小學生地理課本的參攷讀物，還是很相宜的。「清明前後」　讀後  哈榮瑞　　一個浙瀝的雨夜，我激動地讀完了茅盾先生的「前淸明前後」。　　年青人天賦地有着千萬重美麗的期望，但作者吿訴我們，到處仍充滿了「人事關係」；金淡庵，嚴幹臣……等人物，在我們這一個社會中，仍有着他們的影子，他們還很健朗地活着，他們可能還在送第二個「李維勤」走上末路，而自己却坐享其成，可能還在看着唐文君的瘋癩而無感於中。　　作者赤裸裸地揭示着黃金終究戰勝了人格，更强調地，使兩個最純潔的生命做了黃金的俘虜，但是他並不曾輕饒了資本家，他讓唐文君瘋了而說出人間的眞話。「維勤做了什麽了了？他做的還不是大家天天都在做麼？幹嗎他做了一次就算是犯了罪啊！」「這是血，維勤的血，我的血，千萬人的血，哦！這是黃金嗎？磨片火的黃金，壓得死千千萬萬人的黃金！哦！千千萬萬人的血，變成了你們的黃金了了！　　千千萬萬人的血，變成了資本家的黃金了！上海如此，重慶如此，全中國如此，怎不呌人心寒？怎不呌人慟哭流涕！　　林永淸代表了整個中國工業界的式微，任憑你有天大的願望，但是錢！祇有它才是一切機器的原動力，「更新廠」當然不能例外；嚴酷的現實怎不呌人「另竄他路」？又豈獨林永淸呢？　　他要向社會控訴，要代表工業界向千千萬萬有良心的人民控訴！對於國家抗戰，他是問心無愧的，但結果落得焦頭爛額，走頭無路！　　「淸明前後」爲一羣「有良心」的人呼出活命的吶喊！它啓示着：「世界已經變了，中國再不變可就完了！」　　渾噩的夢該醒了吧！同胞們！出版消息　　林庚白生前編集「今詩選」，略仿芮挺章之「國秀集」，李康成之「玉台後集」例，而以已作列於諸家中，現由其夫人林北麗將「今詩選」殘稿輯成一部「麗白樓自選詩」，由開明書店發行，已於最近出版。　　開明書店最近出版之「中國疆域沿革略」，係童書業先生在上海光華大學敎授所用之講義。足供成學治國聞者之參證。　　國文月刋原係西南聯合大學師範學院國文系同人所主編，改由開明書店接辦，編輯人爲郭紹虞，葉聖陶，朱自淸等，宗旨仍爲討論國文敎學的理論跟方法。第四十一期業已在滬出版。　　最新紡紗計算學（下卷）係中國纖維工業研究所最近出版新書，由作者書社經售。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Bai Chongxi Arrives in Shenyang by Plane to Inspect Northeast National Army Defenses <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Beiping Seventeenth Dispatch] The Northeast problem is evolving at an accelerated pace. The people of North China largely foresee ominous developments due to frequent conflicts. The Communist side, citing the worsening Northeast conflicts, is actively sabotaging transportation. The people are watching Marshal Marshall's movements with hope for rescue. Mr. Bai Chongxi and his generals from the Ministry of National Defense arrived in Beiping simultaneously and transferred to the Northeast today. It is generally speculated that Mr. Bai's trip will significantly influence the Northeast military situation and the overall situation in the coming weeks. The siege of Siping has lasted for four weeks, and the Communist forces in Gongzhuling have reached 100,000. On the surface, a stalemate is forming regarding the war in Changchun. Under the instigation of the "Democratic Allied Army," the influence on resolving the Northeast issue is accelerating. Communist figures in Beiping, with an air of confident humility, express their confidence in stopping the National Army. According to a certain "middleman" who recently arrived in Beiping, the Communist army's capture of Changchun seems unlikely, as this move would significantly affect the perception of the Chinese Communist Party by American conservatives, and even force Marshall, who sympathizes with the government, to recover Changchun. This person also stated: "Zhou Baozhong and others, a part of the 'Democratic Allied Army,' may not fully accept the guidance of the CCP Central Committee, and Zhou Enlai himself is not confident in this, as Zhou Baozhong and others believe that the price demanded by the CCP is still too low." Zhou Enlai also personally indicated to this middleman that resolving the problem should shift to addressing the objective and practical responsibilities of the current issue. The recent five-to-one troop reduction plan proposed by the Central Committee further proves this. Finally, this person, based on general observations, stated that a ceasefire in the Northeast will still be agreed upon soon, perhaps within a month.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Shenyang Seventeenth Dispatch] Vice Chief of Staff Bai Chongxi, accompanied by Chief Li Houlong of the Political Department, arrived in Shenyang by plane from Beiping at 4:30 PM on the 17th. Director Xiong, Commander Du, and over a hundred others welcomed him. Mr. Bai met with Director Xiong at the guesthouse, received Commander Du, Chairman Xu, Mayor Dong, and others, and inquired about the situation. When reporters asked about his mission in Shenyang, he said: He had spent several months inspecting the troop training situation along the Tianjin-Pukou, Beiping-Hankou, and Longhai lines, as well as Qingdao and Jinan, and had largely completed his task. He had come to the Northeast specifically for inspection and planned to visit all locations where National Army troops were stationed. When reporters asked about the Northeast takeover issue, he replied: The Communist army's failure to comply with the ceasefire agreement, attacking the National Army, and preventing the takeover is a great regret. In particular, the Communist army's reorganization situation has never been reported. He hoped that the CCP would realize this soon, especially the Northeast Communist army, using the name of the Democratic Allied Army, etc., to obstruct the National Army from taking over sovereignty. When reporters further asked about Marshal Marshall's proposal that the Communist army should withdraw from Changchun, Mr. Bai said: The CCP has not yet responded. Mr. Bai later said: The National Army in various parts of the country has complied with the order to reorganize, the first phase of the plan has been completed, and the training work has also made great progress.</p>
<p>[United Press Nanjing Seventeenth] Sources close to the government announced tonight: Elite National Army troops have reached the north of Sipingjie and have now completely surrounded the city. All signs indicate that the National Army will launch a general offensive against Sipingjie and Changchun in the middle of next week.</p>
<p>[United Press Beiping Seventeenth Dispatch] Government sources today quoted "reliable sources" as saying: The 130,000 Japanese soldiers who were captured by the Soviet army and transported from Changchun have now returned to Harbin and are gradually being sent south to assist the Communist Wehrmacht in combat. These sources also said: In the First and Second Divisions of the Communist army southeast of Sipingjie, there are eighty Japanese railway workers and approximately 180 Japanese officers and soldiers. When the Communist army occupied Changchun last month, more than 1,000 Japanese and Koreans participated in the fighting.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing Seventeenth Dispatch] After arriving in Nanjing, CCP representative Dong Biwu met with Shao Lizi twice last night and this morning. This afternoon, Mr. Dong, accompanied by Lu Dingyi, the person in charge of CCP propaganda, visited Minister of the Interior Zhang Lisheng for over an hour. Zhou Enlai visited Special Envoy Marshall at 10:00 AM and talked for two and a half hours, leaving at 12:30 PM. It is reported that the results of today's talks between CCP representatives Zhou Enlai and Dong Biwu and Shao Lizi, Zhang Lisheng, and Special Envoy Marshall were quite satisfactory. According to sources close to both the government and the CCP representatives, if no further issues arise before the Comprehensive Group meeting, allowing the Comprehensive Group meeting to proceed smoothly in a calm and harmonious atmosphere, resolving disputes through political negotiations first, after the parties concerned have the opportunity to fully understand and study the current situation, this will be extremely beneficial to future military mediation.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Nanjing Seventeenth Dispatch] Chairman of the Sichuan Provincial Government and Acting Director of the Chongqing Military Headquarters Zhang Qun flew to Nanjing from Chongqing late last night. Mr. Zhang paid a visit to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek on the morning of the 17th.</p>
<p>[United Press Washington Seventeenth Dispatch] President Truman told reporters: Special Envoy Marshall's mission in China has not failed. Regarding external reports that Marshall's mediation of cooperation between the Nationalists and Communists has not been successful, the President declined to comment, only saying: If Marshall has the possibility of carrying out his mission in China, he will naturally remain in his post.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Washington Sixteenth United Press] President Truman said: He is not currently considering appointing Pauley as the US Ambassador to China.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing Seventeenth Dispatch] Reliable information: An agreement has been reached among the government representatives, the CCP representatives, and Special Envoy Marshall regarding convening a Comprehensive Group meeting of the Political Consultative Conference. Government and CCP representatives have now gathered in Nanjing. According to CCP representative Dong Biwu, representatives Fei Yanpei, Zhang Junmai, Liang Shuming, and Zhang Bojun of the Democratic League, currently in Shanghai, are scheduled to arrive in Nanjing on the 18th. Zeng Qi, a representative of the Youth Party, is currently traveling between Chengdu and Chongqing and will arrive in Nanjing soon. Chen Qitian, another representative of the Youth Party, will arrive in Nanjing in the next day or two. However, the social figures attending the Comprehensive Group meeting this time need to be separately nominated and will arrive in Nanjing around the 20th. The date of the meeting will be decided after all parties have arrived and submitted their opinions. It is rumored that it may be held on the 22nd.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing Seventeenth Dispatch] At 5:00 PM today, sixteen reporters from various newspapers in Nanjing and Shanghai visited the CCP office at No. 17 Meiyuan New Village after welcoming Director Yu, to interview Zhou Enlai. Zhou was unavailable due to pressing matters. Qi Xieming, Secretary-General of the CCP delegation, met with them instead. The reporters raised the following two questions, asking Qi to convey them: (1) When will Mr. Zhou Enlai depart for Northern Jiangsu with the government representatives and Colonel Koye? Can the reporters from Nanjing and Shanghai be given the convenience of accompanying them to Northern Jiangsu for a visit? (2) Can you tell us the results of Mr. Zhou Enlai's meetings with government representatives and Special Envoy Marshall in recent days? Qi went upstairs to convey the questions, and returned downstairs after about two minutes, answering: (1) The trip to Huaiyin, Northern Jiangsu, is still undecided. Once it is implemented, we will welcome reporters to visit. (2) Mr. Zhou has indeed been negotiating with various parties, but there is nothing to report at present. We will answer later. The reporters left disappointed. Dong Biwu and Lu Dingyi then arrived. The reporters went up to greet them and asked them for information. Dong replied: He had just arrived from Chongqing and was unaware of the situation. All he could say was: (1) Militarily, there must be an unconditional ceasefire in the Northeast. (2) Politically, the issue will be resolved by the Political Consultative Conference group meeting. Subsequently, at the request of the reporters, Dong and Lu re-entered the room together and answered the reporters' inquiries, mainly stating: (1) The Comprehensive Group meeting is indeed planned to be held after the representatives of the Democratic League and the Youth Party arrive in Nanjing. (2) The four representatives of the Democratic League will arrive in Nanjing on the 18th. (3) Mr. Zhou Enlai's trip to Northern Jiangsu has been canceled because the government believes there is no need for it at present.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing Seventeenth Dispatch] Regarding the point in the reporters' inquiries about "whether they are satisfied with the reported merger of the Changchun Communist army with puppet Manchukuo officers and bandit leaders to form the so-called autonomous government," Dong Biwu and Lu Dingyi said that they were still unaware of it. They also said that the CCP office was not very clear about this matter. Yan'an was clearer. The extreme chaos of the current situation in Changchun can be imagined.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper Chongqing Seventeenth Dispatch] The Chongqing Municipal Government held a municipal council meeting on the 15th, discussing in detail the reorganization and planning of Chongqing's finances after the National Government's return to the capital. According to Mr. Zhang Dulun's report, after the return to the capital, Chongqing's consumption has gradually decreased, and production has not increased. The sources of various tax losses will inevitably decline daily. This crisis is related to Chongqing's overall construction and development, which is of great importance. Therefore, the reorganization of municipal finances can no longer be delayed. In the past, municipal treasury advances for various expenses have reached 500 million yuan. In the future, except for emergency needs, advances should no longer be requested at every turn. As for collection operations, relevant units must strictly audit to prevent malfeasance. Furthermore, in order to construct the Two Rivers Bridge in Chongqing, the municipal government submitted a request to the central government for a subsidy of half of the funds. It has now been approved for a subsidy of one-third. The municipal government is actively raising the remaining two-thirds of the funds so that construction can begin as soon as possible.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing Seventeenth Dispatch] Chairman Chiang Kai-shek received dozens of National Assembly representatives from Jiangsu and Shandong provinces in Nanjing on the afternoon of the 17th, including Lu Xiaobo and He Bingru. When the Chairman listened to the representatives' painful account of the unprecedented conditions in the Communist-occupied areas of Jiangsu and Shandong provinces, he sighed for a long time, and a moving look of sorrow appeared on his face. However, he still comforted the representatives with a peaceful and loving attitude, promising to find ways to relieve the innocent refugees fleeing from the two provinces to various places. It is reported that the number of refugees fleeing from northern Jiangsu alone has reached three million. If each refugee is given 10,000 yuan for emergency food relief, it will require 30 billion yuan. If peace is difficult to achieve for a while, what will happen?</p>
<h3 id="e14">Twenty-Nine Days in Changchun <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Shao Shenzhi of this Newspaper</p>
<p>This is a faithful report by Shao Shenzhi, a special correspondent for this newspaper, who personally experienced the Changchun upheaval and was detained in Changchun for twenty-nine days. The full text is 50,000 words and will be sent from Shenyang and published successively.</p>
<p>The Changchun upheaval was a fierce war.</p>
<p>We flew from Shenyang to Changchun on April 9. On the 13th, five American reporters flew in and together we witnessed the tragic scene of the Chinese civil war. Each of us was in constant danger of being swallowed by artillery fire, but we saw houses being burned, people dying in the fierce artillery fire, and people's representatives running around calling for a ceasefire, crying and wailing. We were extremely saddened. We forgot that Changchun was a dangerous place and deeply felt that it was a place where human nature erupted.</p>
<p>We were in Changchun for twenty-nine days. I dare not recall the work during this period. But we must publish our experience so that China and the world can increase a little reference information on the Northeast issue. Although we have lost our freedom, because we are Chinese, we are unwilling to use such encounters to provoke various reactions that are detrimental to peace, nor do we want to point out the faults of any party or any individual. We only prepare to record our experiences and contribute them to friends who care about Chinese peace and to the Chinese people who are suffering, so that they can jointly criticize. We are professional reporters, we cherish our independence, and we also hope that readers can respect our position.</p>
<p>A Major Battle: Seeing Off Karlov</p>
<p>The news that the Soviet army had completely withdrawn from Changchun on the 14th was brought to us by Dong Yanping on the 6th when he flew from Changchun to Shenyang. The Soviet army began to withdraw on the 7th, leaving only two or three hundred people on the 13th. On the morning of the 14th, Karlov left for the last time, and the situation in Changchun took a sharp turn.</p>
<p>Dong Yanping and Malinowski had notified each other that after they left Changchun, Dong appointed Chen Jiazhen, a senior advisor to the Military Affairs Commission, to be responsible for military affairs in Changchun. He was one of the members of the military delegation. Malinowski appointed Karlov to be responsible. Their daily contact was just a casual meeting. Chen originally scheduled a farewell to Karlov on the 14th, but Karlov decided to leave Changchun by train at 10:00 AM (12:00 PM Soviet time), so it was canceled.</p>
<p>At 9:00 AM on the 14th, Chen Jiazhen, Zhang Datong, and Secretary Kong went to the train station to see him off. This was a diplomatic occasion that we could not give up, so we took the car to the train station together. We came out of the Mantan Building and drove to the Foreign Affairs Commissioner's Office, where about five American colleagues went together. Liu Zhuzhou of the Central News Agency had a car, and the Military Affairs Commission gave us a jeep. Eleven people took separate rides and rushed to the train station. After passing the Soviet Army Headquarters at the old YMCA, we saw that the posts had been removed and there was no sound. However, we were solemn because the Communist army had already attacked the Xifei Airport, and contact had begun at 3:00 AM. On the one hand, we were seeing off Karlov, and on the other hand, we were worried about the future situation. Because as soon as the Soviet army withdrew, Changchun immediately fell into war. This was already foreseeable. Therefore, seeing off Karlov made us feel indescribable.</p>
<p>We walked into the station, but the special train had not yet arrived. Chen and Karlov were talking on the platform, with Kong acting as the translator, and introduced us to Karlov. Kong said that there were several American reporters and asked if he would like to talk to them. Karlov faced away from the platform and shook his head quickly without even looking at them. So they were left aside, pacing coldly on the platform, as if they were all passengers waiting for the train, not greeting each other, and each talking to their traveling companions. Although Karlov knew some of them. Karlov was bored standing there, so he suggested pacing and talking. Dong asked: "Has the Soviet army in Changchun all dispersed now?"</p>
<p>"No, there are still two or three people, because they couldn't catch the train, I'm afraid they will stay in Changchun today," Karlov replied.</p>
<p>When the car drove into the station, Karlov and his entourage immediately jumped on it and let the guests who were seeing him off walk in.</p>
<p>On the clean white tablecloth in the official car, vodka and beer, Russian frozen, pickled meat, and beets had been prepared. Everyone raised their glasses together to express their farewell, wish each other good health, and toast to the eternal and solid friendship between China and the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Karlov raised his glass to the reporters and said: "I hope that the friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people can be forever solid, and I hope you will convey this meaning to the readers."</p>
<p>The carriage was small, and the senders and the sent were standing there, squeezed together, holding a glass in their left hand and raising their glasses in their right hand. After about ten minutes, they shook hands with Karlov one by one and said goodbye.</p>
<p>The car drove eastward, and the senders, including a dozen Soviet expatriates, also quietly left the station. The station was extremely empty, with no passengers and no station staff. Chen Jiazhen jumped into the car and rushed back to the Central Bank Defense Headquarters. Zhuzhou also rushed back to the office to make wartime preparations.</p>
<p>At this time, the defense commanders of Changchun, Chen Jiazhen and Liu Dequan, officially announced: all cars should affix a piece of paper with the words "Changchun Defense" written on it, stamped with the seal of the headquarters, and we all received special passes.</p>
<p>At this time, the war in Changchun began to intensify, and we began to live under artillery fire. (To be continued)</p>

<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 17th] Transportation circles report: (1) At Yeqiao Village and Yeqiaoying, eighteen kilometers northeast of Gucheng on the Pinghan Line, there are over two thousand Communist troops from the Tenth Military Sub-district who came from Gaoyang, belonging to the Ying Tang unit. Besides carrying heavy weaponry, they also have over seven thousand rifles, their intentions unclear.

(4) The Qian Suo and Gaoling areas along the North Ning Railway have successively been captured by Communist troops. The defending troops at Wanjia Village sent a desperate telegram at 4 PM today, stating the situation was extremely critical. However, due to the emergence of Communist troops north of Yuguan, reinforcements could not be sent. Currently, trains on the North Ning Railway are running to Yuguan. Last night, a Communist troop squad disguised in beggar's clothing was discovered near Changli, attempting to sabotage the railway, but they were captured by the garrisoned troops. (5) Communist troops have built three artillery emplacements near Yu Jiazhuang, 162 kilometers south on the Pinghan Line.</p>
<p>[United Press, Beiping, 17th] According to authoritative sources here: Fierce battles have erupted around Qian Suo, the first train station outside Shanhaiguan on the North Ning Railway. Communist troops have been continuously attacking for four days, attempting to prevent National Army trains from entering Northeast China. As this lifeline for the National Army's entry into Northeast China is being cut off by Communist troops, the National Army is rapidly sending reinforcements from both the north and south. Reinforcements have been dispatched from Tianjin, Tangshan, and Jinzhou. Currently, the fighting is taking place along a fifty-mile stretch of the North Ning Railway near Shanhaiguan. Furthermore, it is reported that Communist troops are strengthening their positions between the Great Wall and Jinzhou.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 17th] A Communist Party spokesperson stated: Communist troops have completely encircled Beiping and Tianjin, making them the primary targets for coordinated attacks from Zhangjiakou and Rehe into Hebei.

As of now, the situation around the station is extremely chaotic.</p>
<p>Without Results in Improving Treatment, Judges of the Jiangsu High Court Strike; Promise of Two Months' Pay Temporarily Alleviates the Situation</p>
<p>[Our Suzhou Dispatch, 17th] Colleagues in the Jiangsu Higher Court's prosecutorial and judicial review positions have jointly submitted a petition to the Ministry of Judicial Administration requesting increased pay due to the high cost of living. They claim their income is insufficient to support their families and daily sustenance. To date, no response has been received. The concern has been growing since President Sun and Chief Justice Han went to Nanjing without achieving concrete results. Today, all prosecutorial and judicial review staff of the court suddenly and spontaneously went on strike, resulting in an extremely serious situation. After President Sun and Chief Justice Han issued separate directives for persuasion, the prosecutorial and judicial review staff reported to work in the afternoon, but none of the clerks or court staff returned to their positions. The heads of the court are deeply concerned about this issue. Without urgently seeking relief, the situation cannot be remedied. They have specially decided to allow each staff member to receive two months' pay without deductions, which temporarily alleviated the situation. All scheduled court hearings for today have been suspended.</p>
<h3 id="e17">Too Few Lawyers in Beiping-Hebei Affects Trial of Traitors <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 17th] Yu Fengpo, presiding judge of the Second Division of the Hebei High Court, stated that there are no fewer than tens of thousands of traitors in Hebei Province, but only 1,500 have been arrested so far. Of these, approximately 400 have been sent to the Hebei High Court Prosecutor's Office. About 20 have been punished, about 80 have been indicted and sent to the criminal court, and about 30 have been sentenced. However, according to legal regulations, cases involving sentences of five years or more require a lawyer for defense, and there are only fifteen qualified lawyers in Beiping. Therefore, the trial of traitors is significantly affected. It is also learned that major traitors Wang Yintai, Wang Shijing, Yu Xijie, Zou Quansun, Yu Jinhe, Liu Yushu, and Tang Yangdu are still detained in the Army Prison, awaiting instructions from the authorities. Wang is relatively fat in prison and is very respectful to people, lacking the good fortune of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek in his earlier years. Traitor Zhou has a very arrogant attitude and answers that he needs nothing when asked if he requires any items. Female spy Kawashima Yoshiko is ordered to write a diary every day, but it is full of cunning lies.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 17th] Zhang Yongfu, a former committee member of the puppet National Government, was once a close friend of Sun Yat-sen, but shamelessly sided with the traitor Wang Jingwei after the establishment of the puppet government in Nanjing, serving as a puppet committee member.

<h3 id="e20">Capital Reporters Hold Tea Party; Warmly Welcome Yu Youren; Yu Discusses His Thoughts on Returning to the Capital and Encourages Reporters; Lively Discussion on Cursive Script Aims at Calligraphic Revolution <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 17th] The Capital News Reporters Association held a tea party on the 17th to welcome President Yu Youren. Over seventy people attended. No reporters' reception in Nanjing recently has seen such a large number of reporters in attendance at the same time, as in their minds, the Yu being welcomed today is not the President of the Control Yuan but an elder predecessor in the news industry. The tea party began with Ma Xingye as chairman. Lu Qian delivered a welcome speech. Yu then rose amidst warm applause to deliver a speech. First, he discussed his thoughts on returning to the capital, saying that he was filled with emotion because when he thought of the millions of compatriots who were slaughtered when Nanjing fell, and the millions of compatriots who were still in dire straits today upon the return to the capital, he deeply felt the heavy responsibility of those who survived. Yu admitted that the reporters' description of him being "tearful" when he got off the plane the other day was indeed a fact, proving that this old man's emotions were passionate and undiminished with age. Afterwards, in an optimistic tone, he encouraged reporters to consider themselves as builders of a new era and a new China. There is nothing difficult in the world; since the War of Resistance has been won, nation-building will surely succeed. The current diverse and complex phenomena in politics and ideology should be integrated and transformed with the Prime Minister's great spirit of universal love. Finally, Yu sternly criticized the advocates of relocating the capital, saying that we should know that Zhang Zhidong's poem "How can it not ruin a hundred years, this poisonous mountain and river is Jiankang" is a frivolous and absurd act of literary men insulting Nanjing and is not worthy of emulation. We should know that things depend on human effort and should create a "spirit of the place" with "outstanding people." Also, representatives from the student associations of Shangda, Fudan, Zhonggong, and Sanxiao attended today's welcoming meeting and paid their respects to their presidents, deans, and teachers.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 17th] President Yu Youren "promoted" his habitual cursive script in today's welcoming meeting of capital reporters. Amidst a chorus of requests for calligraphy from reporters across the hall, Yu rose and solemnly declared, "If you think that obtaining my calligraphy is something to be cherished, then I will greatly disagree. The reason why I do not like to study oracle bone script and seal script, but only create cursive script, is that there is a profound intention of calligraphic revolution within it. You should know that without riding an airplane, you do not know the value of time. In this new era of seizing time, the cursive script I advocate is characterized by simplicity and rapid strokes, intending to provide a time-saving and effective revolutionary tool for the people. If you value my calligraphy as treasures but do not make this cursive script movement universal, then it is truly contrary to my personal wishes." After finishing his speech, he excused himself amidst enthusiastic applause, and posed for a photo with the welcoming people before departing.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 17th] Qian Changzhao, Chairman of the National Resources Commission, stated: "Although the Commission has been reorganized under the Executive Yuan, there is no substantial change in practice. Currently, the Commission's main tasks, in addition to maintaining important industries and mines in the Northwest and Southwest, are to actively reorganize and restore industries and mines in the recovered areas. At the same time, new constructions are also being planned. As for the future business operations, we will strive for enterprise-oriented management as much as possible. Most businesses will adopt a company structure in accordance with the new Company Law. The businesses recently set up in North China and Taiwan have already been organized into companies, and China Petroleum Limited and other companies will soon be established one after another."</p>

<p>County Government Investigates Enemy Crimes: The county government has decided to complete the investigation of enemy crimes by the 20th of this month and submit it to higher authorities for review. Accurate statistics are currently unavailable. The investigation of these enemy crimes, since the announcement accepting reports from the people, has been met with widespread concern due to its relation to personal interests. Reports are currently being sorted.</p>

<p>Silk Cocoon Loans Approved: This year's spring cocoons are about to appear, and large and small silk factories are resuming work one after another. Mr. An, a representative of the silk merchants of this county, and others went to Shanghai to contact the China Silk Cocoon Company regarding the issue of silk cocoon loans. The company has approved the loan application amount. In the future, each factory can directly apply to the banking syndicate for loan procedures. Also, the registration of cocoon businesses in Wuxi and Cheng counties closed on the 15th, with a total of 309 businesses. The Sericulture Improvement District will send the registration booklets to the Provincial Sericulture Improvement Association for review.</p>

<p>Seawall Collapse; Labor Conscripted for Emergency Repairs: The collapse of the Jinshanwei seawall has led the Soochow-Ningpo Relief Sub-Administration to decide on an emergency repair plan and establish public works offices in Songjiang and other counties to oversee the work. Workers for the emergency repair of the seawall have been conscripted locally, totaling over 500 people, and started repairs on the 15th. The county relief association has allocated 1,380 bags of flour as labor relief. To ensure smooth repairs, County Magistrate Huang has specially dispatched the county security team to fill the defenses to maintain order.</p>
<p>Jiaxing</p>
<p>Township Heads of the Entire County Resign En Masse: Jiaxing's rural areas only produce enough rice to feed themselves each year. This time, the supply of conscripted military grain and the purchase of a large amount of civilian grain for Hangzhou has depleted local reserves. At this time of year when the harvest is scarce, there is a sense of crisis. Recently, the county government was ordered to requisition 18,000 *shi* of military grain, with the price set at 24,000 yuan per *shi* (the current market price of rice is 50,000 yuan), a difference of more than half. Requisition is difficult. County Magistrate Hu specially convened a meeting of all township heads in the county on the 14th. After several discussions, there was no perfect solution. On the 15th, at the meeting, the county government forcibly allocated the quota: 450 *shi* for Category A townships (14 townships in total), 300 *shi* for Category B townships (22 townships in total), 200 *shi* for Category C townships (19 townships in total), and 150 *shi* for Category D townships (10 townships in total). The township heads believed that the people were already on the brink of starvation and it was difficult to bear this amount. Moreover, some villagers had already consumed their rations in advance and had no way to borrow. If requisitioning were to continue, it would be unacceptable. Making up the price difference by allocating it to each household would also violate provincial orders. Therefore, on the afternoon of the 15th, nineteen townships, including Beiping, Huguang, and Anwu, jointly submitted their resignations to the county, requesting to be replaced to avoid delaying official business.</p>
<p>Wujiang</p>
<p>Suzhou-Jiaxing Highway Restores Traffic: The Suzhou-Jiaxing Highway Long Bus Company has completed preparations for resuming operations. It is scheduled to officially resume traffic on May 16. The company has now transported ten new-style buses, temporarily using the Dongwu Hotel outside the station gate as the general station, and has appointed Zhou Zhenxiao as the Suzhou station manager, Zhou Chengfeng as the Wujiang station manager, Gu Minzhi as the Buwang station manager, and Shen Baoru as the Nanxun station manager. It is reported that because the vehicles have not all been transported, the company, in order to consider passenger convenience, will temporarily not crack down on commercial vehicles currently running, except for collecting road maintenance fees. The scheduled departure times are Suzhou at 6 AM, 8 AM, and 1 PM, and Nanxun at 6 AM, 10 AM, and 1 PM. The fare is 1,100 yuan from Suzhou to Wujiang, 1,600 yuan to Bachai, 2,200 yuan to Pingwang, 2,800 yuan to Zhenze, and 3,400 yuan to Nanxun. The Shengze-Jiaxing section is currently rushing to repair bridges and road surfaces and will also restore traffic soon.</p>

<p>Enemy and Puppet Factories Sold at Reduced Prices to Provincial Operation: According to recent statistics, the enemy and puppet properties in Wuhu received and handled by the Anhui Office of the Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Anhui District Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau include warehouses of Wang Zidong Liji Warehouse and Warehouses No. 1, 5, and 6, received by the Central Trust Bureau's Wuhu Office, and the Japanese Soy Sauce Factory received by the Ministry of Economic Affairs' Wuhu Office. The Feian steamer of the British firm Jardine Matheson, received by the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, has been returned. It has been decided that factories such as the Dexin Iron Works, also received, will be sold at reduced prices to the Anhui Provincial Government for operation at the latter's request.</p>

<p>Provincial Temporary Consultative Assembly Appeals for Disaster Relief: Rice and flour prices in Lingbi, Sixian, Fengyang, Huaiyuan, Xuyi, Wuhe, Suxian, Dingyuan in northeastern Anhui and Huoqiu, Shouxian, and Yingshang in northern Anhui are simultaneously rising sharply, causing widespread suffering. The disaster situation is extremely serious. The provincial relief sub-administration has decided to allocate the majority of the 900 tons of flour shipped to Anhui by the Executive Headquarters to the above counties, giving 2,500 bags of flour to each county for emergency relief. However, due to the vast area and large population, it is still difficult to provide universal assistance. The Anhui Provincial Temporary Consultative Assembly has received reports from various counties requesting relief and specially convened a meeting yesterday, deciding to send resident assemblyman Shen Yanjing and others to appeal to the Executive Headquarters for more materials to benefit the disaster victims.</p>

<p>[Our Hangzhou Dispatch, 17th] Over forty dancers in Hangzhou petitioned the Municipal Government on the morning of the 17th, requesting a postponement of the complete ban on dancing scheduled for the end of the month.

<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 17th] National Assembly representatives from Hunan Province hosted the press corps in Nanjing on the afternoon of the 17th to appeal for disaster relief in Hunan and report on the disaster situation. Ma Xuchang, Zhong Boyi, Liu Cicheng, Xiang Naiqi, Xie Jixia, Jiang Chuou, and others reported separately. A summary is given below: Hunan Province has jurisdiction over 78 counties and cities with a population of over 30 million. 54 counties and cities have been occupied. Over 200,000 people have been affected by the disaster, with the most severely affected reaching 4.2 million. The causes of the disaster were the Changsha fire and the three major battles of Changsha, as well as the Hengyang, Changde, and Xiangxi Xuefeng Mountain battles. The province has been affected by war seven times. Subsequently, droughts, windstorms, and locust plagues have had interrelated causes, and disasters have spread throughout the province. This spring, Hunan Province will lack 230,000 tons of grain due to the impact of last year's autumn harvest. Of the 40,000 tons of flour allocated by the Relief Administration, less than 10,000 tons have been shipped out, and only 40 tons have arrived. Various parties are trying to transport it, and 2,000 to 3,000 tons may be shipped out within days, but the amount is still very small. The difficulty of obtaining clothing is due to the relocation and damage of existing yarn factories, making it difficult to produce. Therefore, yarn workers are scarce, and people find it difficult to get clothes. Education has also been largely destroyed. Today's Hunan lacks plowing cattle, seeds, and agricultural tools, creating scorched earth for thousands of miles. In addition, the frequency of bandits has increased due to famine, and people's lives are in deep water. Therefore, we appeal to the people of the country to provide sympathetic assistance and to restore education and commerce as soon as possible.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, United Press, 17th] It is reported that the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) is now planning to do its utmost to eliminate the famine in inland China and hopes to use airplanes, trucks, trains, and ships to transport large quantities of supplies to relieve the disaster areas.</p>
<p>[US Information Service, Washington, 16th] UNRRA Director LaGuardia announced that the first batch of UNRRA supplies for relief in Northeast China has arrived in Shenyang, including 26,400 bags of flour and 2,000 bags of used clothing, which will soon begin to be distributed.</p>

<h3 id="e27">Let Everyone Vigorously Practice Thrift <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>"China is starving, but Shanghai is dancing!" This statement, uttered by a foreign journalist, is a disgrace to us Chinese, especially to the people of Shanghai! Millions upon millions in every corner of China, from the Northwest, North China, and Central China to South China, are struggling daily on the verge of death, while in Shanghai, people indulge in extravagant and luxurious lifestyles without limit. This is a deeply shameful contrast! We appeal to the "United Relief Organization" for aid, and we appeal to foreign countries for assistance, yet some of us in Shanghai live so wastefully. Looking inward and asking ourselves, who should not feel ashamed to death? The United States is the most developed and wealthiest country in terms of production, and its people admire freedom. Now that the war against Japan has ended in victory and World War II has concluded, it should, in principle, be able to return to pre-war living standards. However, they still have not achieved satisfaction in their standard of living; wartime rationing of goods and price controls are still largely in effect. Britain is also a developed country in terms of production. However, the British people still live the same way as during the war, with strict control and rationing of all goods. After fighting for more than five years and defeating Hitler's Japanese warlords, the British people are still living in wartime conditions, with no opportunity to breathe or enjoy life. Only we, a country with backward production, insist on enjoying life without striving for frugality and thrift. This is a disgrace to our nation! Chairman Chiang, seeing this point, has repeatedly emphasized the need for thrift in life. Even the Executive Yuan recently passed a resolution on thrift for civil servants. However, despite the government's repeated orders, the actual results often fall short of expectations. The prevailing atmosphere has led to increasingly extravagant and decadent lifestyles among the people in recent months. Facing the current decline, we must awaken the sense of justice and responsibility of our countrymen and quickly take practical steps to practice thrift, saving some vitality for the country and the nation.</p>
<p>The advocacy of the thrift movement did not begin today. In order to take practical steps to practice thrift and ensure that thrift produces significant results, we must frankly point out that the success of this movement lies not in strict government control but in the people's voluntary compliance. Although the government can issue orders to restrict food consumption or prohibit certain behaviors, such as drinking and dancing, the issuance of these orders may not achieve practical results in thrift; on the contrary, it may make life even more extravagant. The main reason why the thrift movement has not been very effective in the past is that some people believe that the government can restrict people's behavior with a piece of paper. However, if people are not self-aware, the government's orders, no matter how strict, will only lead to numerous malpractices and foster a widespread habit of hypocrisy. Open dancing may be prohibited, but disguised commercial dancing cannot be eliminated. Even if there is a clear order prohibiting gatherings for drinking in restaurants, the practice of entertaining guests at home will still be impossible to stop. All this will lead people to hypocrisy and deception, which is contrary to the New Life Movement advocated by the Chairman. Today, we are raising the timely call for vigorously practicing thrift. We hope that the government can promote this movement, but we also hope that the government authorities will issue orders appropriately. Rather than enacting strict laws and enforcing them leniently, it is better to enact lenient laws and enforce them strictly. To knowingly do what is not feasible will inevitably lead to adverse consequences. Any prohibition must be reasonable and rational in order to be effective. For example, Shanghai is an international city. If we were to absolutely ban dancing and drinking for the sake of thrift, we would not only be ridiculed by friendly nations but also increase the opportunities for hypocrisy and law-breaking. Today, for everything that should be done and must be done, we must awaken the people to act automatically and energetically, based on their conscience and inherent abilities. One person tells ten, ten tell a hundred, and we will not worry about not being able to transform the social atmosphere.</p>
<p>Unreasonable consumption should be curbed in other ways. We do not understand why the market is flooded with unnecessary imported goods such as cigarettes, foreign wines, and fruits, at a time when the government is vigorously practicing thrift. Do we not have domestically produced tobacco and alcohol and locally grown fruits? Why are these unnecessary goods being imported in large quantities at this time? If the government is determined to practice thrift, it should use tariff policies to strictly crack down on the import of unnecessary goods. The import of these unnecessary goods, on the one hand, damages our own backward production sector, and on the other hand, promotes the formation of extravagant habits among the general public. In terms of practicing thrift, the most important aspect is the use of tariff policies to prevent unnecessary foreign goods from being imported, or to make them so expensive that people cannot afford them, thereby curbing the trend of extravagance.</p>
<p>However, in terms of practicing thrift, positive measures are more important than negative measures. The positive measures depend entirely on the people's ability to consciously and automatically take the initiative to practice thrift. Rather than having the government stipulate prohibitions in restaurants, dance halls, tea houses, and wine shops, it is better for all sectors of society to voluntarily formulate three rules and mutually abide by them. Shanghai's trade associations are relatively well-organized. At this time of vigorously practicing thrift, they should take the lead in advocating and discussing ways to practice thrift, and each should conscientiously abide by and implement them. We must encourage everyone to compete in thrift and correct the vain concept of competing in extravagance. We must foster an atmosphere where whoever practices thrift is honorable. In this way, the government can issue fewer prohibitions, and the people's compliance with them may be more effective than the government's prohibitions. We hope that Shanghai's trade associations and social organizations will spontaneously initiate thrift movements without waiting for government orders. The general public should especially understand the difficulties facing the country and sincerely and earnestly abide by all thrift decisions. Only when everyone is of one heart and one mind can the movement function and achieve its goals. Here, we want to awaken every citizen's sense of responsibility for vigorously practicing thrift, which is something everyone should do.</p>
<p>Moreover, the entire country is now actively launching a thrift movement. Shanghai is China's premier city, and it is also the beginning of a new mayor's term. We must actively launch a thrift movement, be pioneers for Shanghai's new municipal administration, set an example for the national thrift movement, and wash away the shame of being called a "den of iniquity" for a century. May the citizens of Shanghai rise up together and vigorously practice thrift!</p>

Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov only accepted the US suggestion to send a four-nation investigation team to Germany to investigate the progress of disarmament. As for the revised terms of the Italian armistice treaty, they must first be submitted to the Italian government before being announced. It is expected that this includes a provision to abolish the United Nations Control Commission for Italy.</p>

<p>[Our newspaper's news] London, 17th broadcast: The British Cabinet delegation to India announced to reporters today that Britain is indeed determined to withdraw from India. Indian Affairs Minister Lawrence said that the work of ending the British institutions in India has already begun, but the delegation will remain in India to urge the two major Indian parties to accept our plan.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 17th] Authoritative sources here say that the British government's autonomy plan for India does not set a deadline for India to accept it. It is reported that Indian Governor-General Wavell has already begun consultations with Indian leaders to establish a government composed entirely of Indians. According to New Delhi news, Gandhi said at a prayer meeting yesterday that the plan announced by the British government is a major event in Indian history and deserves careful study. Therefore, he hopes that the masses will remain calm and not be tempted by extremists. Jinnah, the leader of the Muslim League, is now in New Delhi and will probably issue a statement today. The plan announced by the British government supports the unification of India and opposes Jinnah's proposal to divide India and establish an independent Muslim state. Because this requirement is not sufficient to solve the problem of ethnic minorities and because its position is in the strategically important northeast and northwest borders, it has been rejected by the British cabinet delegation. Ali, the leader of the London branch of the Muslim League, has stated that this plan is tantamount to selling out the Muslims of India. He plans to convene a mass rally in London on June 2 to protest.</p>
<p>[Reuters, New Delhi, 17th] Governor-General Wavell gave a broadcast to the Indian people this afternoon, elucidating the outline of the British Cabinet delegation's proposal for an Indian interim government.

<p>[Reuters, London, 17th] The British government's White Paper was issued simultaneously in London and New Delhi yesterday. This is the British government's greatest effort to bring India to complete independence, an unprecedented move in the history of any empire. When Prime Minister Attlee read the White Paper in the Lower House yesterday, Churchill called it a "new situation" sufficient to represent the Labour Party's "new imperial policy." However, regardless of the criticisms from all sides, the British position remains that "the Indians should unite themselves and establish a constitutional body to formulate a constitution." The current question is whether Muslims or Hindus are willing to accept it. There are now two paths for Jinnah to follow: either to accept the British proposal or a similar solution, or to engage in civil war. As for the Hindus, although the British proposal is similar to the demands of the Congress Party, there are also those that they oppose, such as the autonomy of the Muslim provinces, the division of provinces according to ethnicity, and the right of residents to choose. Before the establishment of the All-India Constituent Assembly, separate constitutional conferences will be established. The British proposal has done its best in a written document that cannot be compromised to equate the gains and losses of the two forces. As for supporting the unification of India, this is a natural result. The White Paper begins by stating that only Muslims oppose unification, but supporting unification inevitably promotes the principle of dividing India into four, so the result still cannot solve the ethnic problem in India. The White Paper proposes the establishment of an Indian Federation with both executive and legislative bodies. The former handles foreign affairs, national defense, and transportation matters for the entire territory of India, including the princely states, while the remaining powers are delegated to the provinces and states themselves. Each province can organize its administrative and legislative bodies according to the ethnicity and beliefs of its residents. Each division can decide on the common governance of the province. Regarding the constitutional issue, one representative can be elected for every million residents. After the election, they will be divided into three factions: Muslim, Sikh, and general. All provinces are also divided into three groups. The first group is the Hindu provinces, and the other two groups are the Muslim regions of the Northwest and East. Among the 292 seats in the All-India Constituent Assembly, 210 seats should belong to the general representatives, 78 seats belong to the Muslim representatives, and 4 seats belong to the Sikh representatives. In addition, each department can elect up to 93 seats. The three groups will first hold separate meetings, and then, in the position of the Federal Constituent Assembly, formulate the final constitution of a free India. The White Paper concludes with a warning, stating that if this method is not accepted, there will be unrest and even civil war, so it calls on the Indian people to accept independence. It is reported that the White Paper will not be submitted for debate within a few weeks, but the leaders of all parties will speak today.</p>

As a result, rice prices continued to rise. According to the original regulations of the Rice Market Management Committee, all transactions between businesses were limited to spot transactions.

<p>[This Newspaper's Report] As general commodity prices stabilize, rice prices are getting worse and worse, rising by 3,000-4,000 yuan per day. Yesterday,粳rice from Changshu and Wuxi in the rice market soared to a new high of 58,000 yuan. Retail prices in rice shops reached as high as 62,000 yuan. Reporters repeatedly visited grain administration officials, rice merchants, and transportation officials. All parties expressed incomprehension about the repeated increases in rice prices in recent days. We then visited the Minsheng and China Merchants Steam Navigation Companies, which are responsible for transporting Sichuan rice, to inquire about the transportation of 2 million dan of Sichuan rice. It is learned that Minsheng Company has deployed all 20 or so of its Sichuan River ships to transport Sichuan rice. In addition, it plans to find a way to use 20 newly purchased landing craft. Recently, these landing craft have successfully navigated from Yichang to Chongqing and from Chongqing to Hankou by boat owner Han Nish. A large number of sailors are currently being trained to operate them. China Merchants Steam Navigation Company will allocate the Jiangqing (160 tons) and Jianghe (450 tons) to assist in the transportation of rice. Jiangqing is currently in Chongqing, and Jianghe will sail from Shanghai to Chongqing on the 18th, arriving around the end of the month. It is heard that the 2 million dan of Sichuan rice entrusted to be transported by the Ministry of Food is equivalent to 150,000 tons. It is planned to transport half to Hankou and Nanjing first, and then distribute it to other places from these two locations. It is estimated that these ships can transport 10,000 tons of rice per month. The freight rate is 70% of the</p>

<h3 id="e95">The Foreign Ministers' Conference Ends Hastily <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>The foreign ministers of the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union held meetings in Paris from the 25th of last month until the adjournment yesterday, a full three weeks. During these twenty-one days, the four foreign ministers discussed several important issues regarding post-war Europe, expending much effort and energy. However, due to differing national interests and opinions, they failed to reach any agreement. Not only did the four foreign ministers exert themselves in vain, but they also greatly disappointed people around the world who hoped that nations would cooperate after the war to maintain peace.</p>
<p>In this conference of foreign ministers, the efforts of U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes are most noteworthy. He went to Paris with the attitude of "no failure allowed, only success," willing to compromise on every important issue and repeatedly proposing compromise solutions, but still unable to avert the misfortune of the foreign ministers' conference. From this, it can be seen that international contradictions are deeply rooted and cannot be easily eliminated.</p>
<p>In all fairness, the failure of this foreign ministers' conference was expected. From the day it opened, we had no extravagant hopes. Since the end of the war, there have been countless international conferences, some unresolved and others unimplemented, which have long diluted our interest in international meetings. However, seeing the hasty closure of this four-nation foreign ministers' conference and its perfunctory nature, one cannot help but express surprise.</p>
<p>After the four foreign ministers passed the US proposal for a one-month recess, they didn't even set the date for the next meeting, nor did they appoint members of the special committee on German issues. The four foreign ministers then went together to the magnificent wine room of the Luxembourg Palace to drink heavily, using alcohol to relieve their sorrows and lighten the bitterness in their hearts. This is a strange phenomenon rarely seen in diplomatic history! Therefore, the failure of this foreign ministers' conference is worse than the unhappy ending of the five-nation foreign ministers' conference held in London last September.</p>
<p>The foreign ministers' conference will reconvene in a month, on the 15th of next month. What the future holds, no one can predict. However, it can be asserted that Europe's political stalemate, if prolonged, will not be a blessing for the world's people.</p>

<p>Vietnamese overseas Chinese in this city, who previously refused to board a French ship to return home, once clashed with the French side. Yesterday, Nguyen Huu Can and other representatives of the Vietnamese Overseas Chinese in North Vietnam jointly submitted a request to our military and political authorities, requesting our assistance in their voluntary return to their hometowns, or requesting that our side and the French side arrange that if they return home on French ships, they must not be drafted again, and must also request the British and American sides to provide the same guarantee.</p>
<h3 id="e105">The Whole Country is Covered in Gloom; The Postal Service Also Encounters the Fate of Division <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] In times when the whole country is covered in gloom, the postal service has also encountered the fate of division. However, through the efforts of the authorities and compromising, local "exchange" of postal services has finally begun. However, it must be solemnly declared that this does not mean that the stamps with Mao Zedong's portrait are recognized, but rather out of consideration for the people's burden, to save them from a late fee and a fine.</p>
<p>The ceasefire agreement cannot stop the advance of the Communist army, so recently the six bureaus of Qidong, Dong'an Town, Jiulong Town, Beixin Town, Sanyang Town, and Qilin Town, which are under the jurisdiction of the Shanghai Postal General Bureau, have been successively occupied. At the same time, the stamps with Mao Zedong's portrait printed by the "Traffic Bureau of the Soviet Border Region Government" were also quickly delivered to Shanghai from there.</p>
<p>These stamps are divided into three types: (Convenience) (Air) (Print), and these three characters are printed in the center of the upper line, which represents ordinary letters, airmail, and printed matter. In addition, there are morning glory stamps with English translations below, which are probably the words "Soviet China." The general face value is five cents and one dime (which is the anti-Japanese currency issued by the Communist Party, not the ordinary national currency). An ordinary letter only requires a postage of two dimes, but don't underestimate this area of two dimes. Sometimes its elasticity will exceed the price you pay for a fast letter now!</p>
<p>It is reported that several regions in North China have also implemented postal services. In central Hebei Province, our green-clothed messengers are allowed to freely pass through the Communist army blockade line to deliver letters, but must go through a "check" procedure. Therefore, the post office only accepts ordinary letters for mailing to the Communist army area. (The illustration shows the stamps issued by the Communist Party)</p>
<h3 id="e106">Yuan Meiyun's Drug Use Case; Sentenced to Six Months; The Little Woman Weeps Silently; Washing Her Face with Tears; Request for Re-examination and Bail Denied; Sighs from the Audience <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The sensational case of film star Yuan Meiyun's drug use has been concluded yesterday. Judge Lian Zhenbang pronounced the sentence in court, sentencing her to six months in prison and depriving her of her civil rights for one year. After hearing the sentence, Yuan covered her face with a handkerchief and wept softly. Her condition was extremely miserable. Sighs of sympathy were heard in the audience, and her mother cried even more.</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 2:30, the courtroom was packed with spectators, and the windows were also crowded with men and women. Yuan was brought into the dock by two judicial police officers, Zhang Ji and Pan Zhupeng, in front of the crowd. Yuan was wearing a black cheongsam, yellow stockings, and half-high-heeled yellow and white leather shoes. Her hair was very messy, and a white flower hairpin was inserted in her right corner. Her face was pale and thin. She often lowered her head and wept behind the white-rimmed sunglasses on her nose, and tried her best to avoid being photographed by photographers. After Judge Lian questioned her, Dr. Cao Zhishou, a witness, was summoned. Cao was a student of Yuan's father and was familiar with Yuan. According to reports, Yuan quit smoking on December 24 last year and has been abstinent since February 14 this year. Subsequently, the debate began. Lawyer Le Houwei said: "The defendant has quit smoking. The police station forcibly recognized the stomach medicine that the defendant ate as a quit-smoking drug and arrested and handled the case. It is obviously intended to use the defendant's film star status as a propaganda for the anti-smoking movement, which is not appropriate in terms of reason and emotion." Lawyer Huang Menggang said: "Since the defendant has no criminal behavior and no smoking behavior, the forensic doctor determined that he was smoking based on his complexion, but did not use proper methods, such as urine, head, fingers, and physiological metamorphosis to examine his smoking habits. It is inappropriate and a re-examination should be requested." The court refused. Finally, the defendant stated: "There is an elderly mother and young brother at home who rely on Ji for a living. This time , he has lost his reputation and future, so please acquit him and first post bail and stay healthy.” Judge Lian did not allow his request and immediately pronounced the sentence, and explained: "As long as you are determined to quit, you can avoid the punishment." The film star was taken to the women's prison in the District Court with tears in her eyes and weeping silently.</p>
<p>Yuan Meiyun Wipes Tears After Hearing the Verdict</p>
<h3 id="e107">High Court Hears the Case of Traitors; Gambling Table Owner Speaks Vulgarly; Pseudo-Judge Avoids the Important and Takes the Light; Zhu Shunlin's Case is Concluded in One Trial and the Sentence is Scheduled <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Yesterday, the Special Criminal Court of the High Court tried several cases of traitors. The first case was Zhu Shunlin. Zhu was from Baoshan, 51 years old. Before the war, he opened the Shunyuan Teahouse in Shanghai West, gathering gamblers and making profits. After Shanghai fell, he opened a gambling den. He then served as the chief inspector of large gambling dens such as Hollywood, Huilege Palace, and the Six Nations Hotel, and colluded with Lu Ying, the pseudo-Shanghai Police Chief, to obtain licenses by force. In 1931, he set up a Dasheng gambling den in Nanyang Bridge, using "Ruele" donations to fund the pseudo-police bureau. He also sent the pseudo-Special Agents Headquarters a reward of 100,000 yuan. His bad deeds were obvious and his harm to the people was not small. During the trial, Zhu was wearing a blue shirt, black shoes, had a shaved head, thick eyebrows, big eyes, and a red face. He spoke vulgarly. According to his confession: In "Hollywood," the defendant was an employee, only "Dasheng" had a small share, and other gambling dens were used by others under his name, and he flatly denied his collusion with Lu Da. He claimed that he was definitely not a traitor. Later, lawyers Zhang Shizhao, Ma Zhenzong, and Luo Jiaheng defended him, saying that in 1929, the defendant had rescued Zhao Guoliang, a member of the San Min Zhuyi Youth League, and in 1932, he had rescued American soldier Wake and Peng Xiaolin, and had also funded the construction of houses to help refugees. The court ordered the debate to end and scheduled the sentence to be pronounced on the 21st in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Yang Hui, a native of Wuxi, 30 years old, joined the Wuxi Anti-Enemy Support Association and the Youth Salvation Corps cadres' propaganda work after the outbreak of the War of Resistance Against Japan. He also served as the secretary and judicial section chief of the Wuxi People's Self-Defense Regiment of the Jiangnan Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army. In February 1931, he surrendered to the enemy and served as the deputy director of the intelligence section of the Wuxi Station of the Pseudo-Special Agents Headquarters, and later served as the director of the Changzhou Branch of the Pseudo-Political Security Bureau and the deputy director of the Pseudo-Suzhou Branch. During the trial, Yang tried to quibble, and Court President Xiao ordered another hearing.</p>
<p>Huang Fusen, a native of Suzhou, 39 years old, was originally the deputy Chinese detective of the pseudo-Public Concession Central Police Station and the Chinese detective of the Shanghai Police General Bureau. After the outbreak of the Pacific War, he served as the deputy detective of the special high section of the Second Section of the pseudo-Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau and the deputy detective of the criminal section. The defendant admitted to the pseudo-positions he held. He only said that he only managed theft cases and had rescued judicial personnel such as Dai Rongduo. He was shot several times in the case of capturing the Huangdao Society, so he never harmed the country or harmed the people. The defendant hired lawyers Chen Tingrui and Xu Yin to defend him. The court ordered a later hearing.</p>
<p>Jiang Liquan, a native of Jiangyin, 35 years old, was originally a judge of the Shanghai District Court. After the outbreak of the Pacific War, he joined the pseudo-court and served as a pseudo-judge. According to his confession, he only handled ordinary cases during his tenure, did not try political cases, and had protected underground workers and Zhang Baosheng, the liaison officer of the Loyal and Patriotic Salvation Army, and never harmed the country. The defendant did not hire a lawyer at the trial, and no family members came to the court to observe.</p>
<p>In addition, Yang Yongrui, the pseudo-Jiangyin detective patrolman, and Chen Yufu, Cheng Weisheng and other three traitors were also tried, and all were ordered to be heard again at a later date.</p>

<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] At 3 p.m. yesterday, the High Court pronounced sentences in two cases of traitors: (1) Chang Dongming, the pseudo-district chief, colluded with the enemy country and plotted to resist this country, sentenced to four years in prison and deprived of his civil rights for three years. The charges are the same as above. The verdict on the two traitors Fang Xiang and Ye Zhihua will be announced tomorrow.</p>
<p>In addition, the High Prosecutor's Office recently filed a public prosecution of suspected traitors, including Wang Lubin, Yang Shouzhang, Chang Yuqing, Ha Junqiu, and Ruan Xingzhou, a total of five cases.</p>
