<p>〔中央社南京二日電〕中樞紀念週二日上午九時舉行，蔣主席親臨領導行禮，並致訓，主席勗勉參加紀念週之國民黨員國大代表要主意會塲秩序，並遵守義事規則，依次序發言，發言時布省時間，最爲重要，要簡單明瞭，並養成民主習慣。國父之民權初步須平心靜氣，熟習造成一切會場之好風氣。主席並稱：國大今已進入制憲階段，繼勉各代表認眞討論，以國家民族爲前提，一心一意實行三民主義，達成革命目的，訓詞歷半小時，旋即禮成。</p>
<p>〔又電〕國民大會代表報到，自十一月二日開始，至今日止已滿一月，今續有民社黨代表鄭天拭，伍藻池，社會緊達代表喜　嘉錯，但懋辛，蒙古代表奇全禧，區域代表胡鐵華六人報到，連前已報到代表總計一六五二人。</p>
<p>〔本報南京二日電〕國大主席團二日下午六時舉行第九次會議，決議如下：（一）關於各代表產生單位，推選參加憲草綜合審查委員會委員人選案，決議，由各單位推選主席團候選人，召集各單位代表自行推定，並限於十二月三日上午十二時前，將名單送交主席團。（二）憲草審查會記者可否旁聽案，決議，可予旁聽。（三）決定第七次大會日期，並推定主席案，第七次大會定十二月三日上午九時至十二時，下午三時至六時舉行，並推孔表庚，劉代表靜蘅分任上下午主席？</p>
<p>〔本報南京二日電〕速日國大開會，由各代表陸續對憲草廣泛提出意見。據聞：主席團方面已決定三日仍全日開大會，續由各代表發表意見，所有提案擬以三日下午六時爲截止時間，自四日起上午舉行大會，下午則舉行審査會，將原提案提付討論。聞此項決議，將俟提出大會討論後，始可決定。</p>
<h3 id="c2">國大第六次會議　潘公展張知本等熱烈批評憲草 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>〔本報南京二日電〕國民大會於十二月二日舉行第六次會議，繼續對憲草作廣泛之交換意見。上午十時二十五分鳴鈴開會，雷副秘書長報吿代表報到一六一五人，出席一一七九人，已足法定人數。旋由白崇禧主席領導行禮如儀，報吿員宣讚上次會議紀錄後白主席宣稱，開始討論憲草，請各代表遵守會塲秩序依次發言。當有楊幼烱等十四代表分別發表意見，茲各誌如决：</p>
<p>湘區代表楊幼烱主張對直接民權應四權同有規定，憲草中第十二章「選舉」應擴大爲「直接民權一，加列罷免，創制，複決三權。</p>
<p>湘區代表賀醒漢，主張删除第二十六條第一，二兩項，關於立監委爲國大代表之規定，而於區域選舉外加列職業選舉，以便將政權治權劃分明白。</p>
<p>豫職代表楊一峯主張建都北平，列舉四點理由：「（一）就國防言，數十年內我們之國防必在北方，遠攻不如近防，距邊疆近，心埋上可時時警戒。（二）國父遺敎中並未說明要建都南京，常初要袁世凱到南京乃係策略作用。（三）北方氣候分明，有益於國民體格及精神之鍜錬。（四）遷都與否不應打算盤，　打，亦不應只算遷移費，必須將南京之建設與北平之荒廢計算在內。」</p>
<p>遴選代表潘公展就憲草修正案質疑五事：「（一）關於國家的領土，只須幾個立法委員舉舉手就能加以變更，是否可以？（二）人民之政權需要保護，需要有力量，才可以衛民權，控政府，如就此憲草決定，我們一生是否還有政權可行？（三）直轄市出不出國大代表？爲何不在憲法中規定？（四）中央地方之權限均爲列舉，有爭執時依第一一三條由立法院解決，立院究是中央機關抑地方機關？是吾一方列舉一方槪括較爲合理？（五）直轄市之地位竟由立法院決定，是否要直轄市，抑係有意抹殺？</p>
<p>察區代表王寅主張應將政權治權劃分明白，以免治權機關彼此磨擦，减損行政效能。</p>
<p>遴選代表陳顧遠，就憲草修正案技術上之矛盾不通處提出五項意見：（一）行憲日期旣規定由法律定之，但依第一四六條法律須由立法院通過，經總統頒布始能成立，無總統何人公佈行憲日期？（二）第八十五條與第一〇三條關於公務員懲戒權究屬司法或監察，應由憲法明確釐定。（三）第一條文字累贅不通，「民有民治民享」就是民主，重複太多，何不簡稱爲「三民主義之民主共和國」。（四）關於立法院之職權，政協決議僅謂「相當」於一般民主國家之「議會」，並未云「是」，今憲草修正案且超出之，將五權憲法及權能劃分一筆抹殺，殊屬不當。</p>
<p>婦女代表健伯羣稱：（一）國大應有協助總統之機會，（二）立法院權太大，（三）基太國策章所規定者過於籠統，草率糢糊，應分章明列。渠主張憲法應爲硬性，應無所不包。</p>
<p>遴選代表蕭錚謂，十八九世紀各國憲法，注重政治方面，本世紀開始注重經濟方面。憲草修正案不足以保障人民生活，國民經濟制度應提出補充，列爲專章，土地制度允應參考五五憲草，詳加規定。</p>
<p>自由職業代表馬續常，主張對提審制再作積極規定。康區代表周馥昌稱，中央政權機關稱「國民大會」，各省政權機關應改「省民代表大會」爲「省民大會」以求一致。</p>
<p>遴選代表張知本，發表意見：（一）「民有。民治。民享。」在技術上欠佳，在心理上更壞，國父可借林肯總統之言解釋三民主義，吾人不能以之强加諸中國憲法。（二）立法院侵奪國大權限與事理不合。</p>
<p>藉口人民程度不够，允屬不當。（三）國父遺敎對縣之地位極重視，今憲草修正案全予忽略。渠稱：「除非認「五五」憲草可以修正，五權憲法不能變更」之意見爲成見，予決無成見，亦決不固執我見」。</p>
<p>綏區代表祁志厚，指出僅用五權名義實際上旣非五福，也非三權，政治必流於無能，乃極端危險之事。</p>
<p>綏區代表李正樂講述綏省蒙漢同胞相處情形後，主張在行政方而應行單一制度。</p>
<p>遴選代表于望德稱，行政院院長行使職權時，隨處受立法院之牽扯，遠反「政府有能」之原則。</p>
<p>至此已屆十二時正，白主席應會衆之請報吿，下午三時繼續開會後宣布散會。</p>
<h3 id="c3">下午繼續會議　代表發言踴躍 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>〔本報南京二日電〕二日下午三時半國大第六次大會繼續舉行，出席代表一一〇七人，仍　續自由發表意見，有延國符，孫義昌，劉蘅靜，鄒秉文，樓桐孫，何適，陳長蘅，陳紫楓，謝澄平，溫士源等相繼發表談話，四時五十五分至五時十分休息一刻鐘，大會至六時宣佈散會。茲誌各代表重要意見如次：</p>
<p>延國符：（一）吾人應對國府提出之憲草加以硏究，使其更臻進步，（二）中央自治地方自治一點，中央包括五院，地方自治包括省縣與蒙藏地方，（三）人民有四權，國大代表無四權，國大應有行使四權之規定，（四）總統任期應改爲四年，連選得連任。</p>
<p>孫義昌：憲草第三章國大代表應增加職業團體及婦女團體參加選舉。</p>
<p>劉蘅靜：一部良好憲法，應注意其一面可以實現良好的理想，一面可以適合現實。本人認爲政權要能控制治權，憲政要爲全民政治，憲草應修改者約爲下列二點：（一）國大應有權選舉立委監委，（二）農工權利婦女權利要特別保障。</p>
<p>鄒秉文：（一）對一般的農民，要探均衡原則，（二）行憲非吾等主張，但開完會後仍應採一過渡辦法</p>
<p>何適：基本精神民主，成份應該加强，治權與政權之間使發生制衡作用。第三章國大除選舉總統已無政權，故人民即不能控制政府。</p>
<p>樓桐蓀：（一）國民政府領導北伐，堅持抗戰有功甚大，故憲法內應增國民政府之地位。世界大同的理想，最基本者，在於經濟之安定，然後才有力量，才能實現萬能政府的理想，（二）行政院對立法院負責一點，隨時可使行政院發生危機，將使政有隨時動搖之危機。</p>
<p>陳長蘅：制憲應本「公」「正」「誠」「明」四宇，始能成一部好憲法，本人意見如次：第一條，應改爲「中華民國爲三民主義共和國」，第二條中華民國之主權屬於人民全體，應改爲國民全體。第三章，國大代表應增加職業代表，婦女代表。第四章，國大職權應加罷免立法委員監察委員之權。第八九兩章，應加中央政府一章。第七章司法院，應增副院長。第九章監察委員人數太多。第十一章省縣制度應增蒙藏制度。第十四章基本國策應分章。</p>
<p>方青儒：選舉章對選舉人及被選舉人之年齡，有所限制，不知省長市長是否亦受此規定。</p>
<p>錢昌祚：基本國策章，經濟·教育·外交應分開。</p>
<p>郭衡：國民政府完成北伐與抗戰乃一有能的政府，應於憲法內規定。</p>
<p>李江秋：建都應在北平。</p>
<p>謝澄平：確立職業代表選舉制度，此即在保守之英國及日本均有職業代表。立委與社會各方面，均有關聯，如若選舉，以一省爲單位，最低應有一人，惟有如此始能解決人民生活的要求，以奠定强化經濟的民主。其次基本國策一章，應有强國民敎育，方能實現民有。民治。民享的理想，才能達到總理的理想。</p>
<p>溢土源：第一條民治·民有·民享應取消，改爲「中華民國爲三民主義民主共和國」。第七條應確定建都北平。第十一條至十五條，對自治之規定，「不得以法律限制之」。第廿四條則確定在若干情形下，可以「受憲法之保障」有所抵觸。吾人認爲應採取相對自由。第十一條至十五條，仍照舊。第廿四條，則增加「危害國家安全之情形下」句以爲限制。第一四九條「憲法之解釋，由司法院爲之」，應由特種機構解釋，吾人主張在國大內成立若干人，並加立委一人或三人組成之，專司解釋憲法之事。第一四七條，所列附項取消。</p>

<p>〔中央社華盛頓一日電〕華盛頓郵報本日論稱：蔣主席實爲現時代最傑出之中國政治領袖，且能使國民大會成爲中國眞正民主發展之開端，惟有建立眞正之民主，使中國人民巨大之潛在力得以充分發揮，然後中國始能邁步於民主之途。該報希望國民大會能詳細審査憲法草案，使其在條件許可下，盡量成爲民主化眞正可行之憲法，並認目前國大之進展意義重大，而令人快慰。</p>

<p>〔本報南京二日電〕孫院長二日午後於中宣部中外記者招待膚上答覆問題時稱：和平商談隨時可恢復，就政府方面而論，談判之門並未關閉。關於外傳政府將於國大開會期間改組說，渠太人並無所聞，至共黨是否將參加改組後之政府，渠之看法爲共然如願參加，自無問題。某記者詢渠對建都南京抑北平之看法，孫氏認首都旣已設於南京，若無特別嚴重理由，自以不遷都爲宜，蓋國都之遷移並非易事。抗戰時期我人選都重慶，係萬不得已之事，現旣還都南京，若無非不得已之事故，余以爲不應隨便變動。至國都設於何處應吾由憲法明文規定一點，孫氏之看法爲假使定都問題並未發生爭議，則憲法不予明文規定，自無不可，現旣已發生問題，若憲法中不予明確規定，則人心易發生動搖，且足以影響工作，因之，渠主張憲法對國都一點應有規定。</p>
<h3 id="c6">國大代表並無任期 <a href="#c6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>孫院長除答覆上述間題外，並曾答覆國大與憲草等間題，茲誌其重要者如下：</p>
<p>問：國大中有一小部份代表正醞釀行憲問題，盼院長對此運動能予解釋。</p>
<p>答：此問題應向醞釀此種運動者提出，蓋余並未參加此一問題也</p>
<h3 id="c7">青年黨成立紀念　特舉行中外記者招待會　說明該黨之歷史及政見 <a href="#c7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>〔本報南京二日電〕二日爲中國靑年黨成立二十三週年紀念，該黨特於下午一時半假國大會堂休息室舉行記者招待會，報吿該黨歷史及政見，到中外記者二百餘人，由該黨秘書長陳啓天主持，除報吿外，並答記者問，至二時許散。晚六時靑年黨在康樂園舉行聚餐，到百餘人，極一時之盛。陳啓天談話要點如次：今日爲本黨廿三周年耙念日，本黨出席國大代表，乘此機會歡迎諸位，並略將太黨主張奉吿：甲，靑年黨成立於民十二年十二月二日，爲民主政治舊鬥至今已有廿三年。乙，靑年黨的根本有三：（一）國家主義（二）民主政治（三）社會立法。丙，目的：對內造成全民福利的現代國家，對外促進平等合作的和平世界。丁，特性：（一）中和性（二）建設性。</p>
<p>問：國大代表任期是否將延長至行憲日期開始時止？</p>
<p>答：依國大組織法親定，此次國大之任務僅爲制定憲法，並決定行憲日期，任務終了即終結，代表並無任期。</p>
<h3 id="c8">解釋國大兩種職權 <a href="#c8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>問，今日大會中有人認爲憲草中之國大權限太小，而立法院權限太大，院長爲此問題之權威，盼能作一解釋。</p>
<p>答，此爲解釋問題，非三言兩語所能說明，根據憲法草案，國大有兩種職權，即選舉與罷免總統。副總統創議憲法修改及複決立法院所提憲法之修正案，一般人認爲國民大會權限過小者，或由於五五憲草中規定國大除選舉。罷免總統。副總統外，尙得任免立法院。監察院正副院長及立委·監委·此一規定，當時政協開會時，其他黨派會予反對，依余之看法，人民行使之四權始爲直接民權，國大爲人民所選出之代表所組成，因之，其所行使者，僅爲間接民權。按照進步理論，總統，立法院長及監察院長等由人民直接選舉，始可謂直接民權，中國情形複雜，立法院，監察院長等之選舉。罷免，如皆由三四千人所組成之國大選舉，恐行不通，因之，有此種變通辦法，由人民選舉國大代表區，中國大代表替代人民選舉或罷免總統。副總統，而其他公務員，則用其他方法選舉之，蓋一切重要官吏，若皆由國大選舉，姑不論時間有間題，且將造成國大包辦全國民權之現象，實與現代最進步之制度不合。</p>
<p>問，有謂此次於國大所提出之無草修正案違背五權精神，此說確否？</p>
<p>答，此說並不完全準確，外間所以發生此種誤解，係由於彼等對憲草未加澈底硏究，對政權與治權之意義朱能分淸所致，所謂治權者，即人民所委託辦理之權，五院受人民委託辦事，當爲治權，然行使治權者，亦可能行駛政權，如身爲公務員者，並非僅能行使治權，選舉時，公務員亦可以國民之身份投票，其選舉種並未因爲公務員即遭剝奪。又如國大代表同時又爲公務員者，爲數頗多，當可同時行使政權與治權，若謂行使治權後，即不能行使政權，實完全不通，一般人因觀念不淸，乃發生錯誤見解。</p>

<p>問，根據憲草第四條規定，中華民國之領土，非依法律不得變更之，一般人對根據法律即得變　領土表示不滿，院長對此有何解釋？</p>
<p>答，領土之變更，例由條約規定之，例如台灣本爲日本所佔，抗戰勝利，國土重光，台灣重入我版圖，然此事之一合法化」尙須俟和的之正式簽訂，而和約又須經立法院批准，完成立法程序，始能成立，故憲草有「非依法不得變更之」之規定。</p>
<p>問，憲草在國大審查時，是否將大加修改。</p>
<p>答，此點現尚不知道，須俟審査後始能知悉。</p>
<p>問，根據國大組織法，國大會期定爲十日至廿日，必要時得延長之，會期之延長，究應由國民政府公布，抑國大本身可宣布延長，是否可無限制延長？</p>
<p>答，國大延長會期之飛，屬於國大本身，無限制處長之事，似產致發生。</p>
<p>問，國大將休會幾日？</p>
<p>答，憲草審議會已分組成立，即可進行審查工作，在審査過程中，大會將停開若十日，至休會之期聞則未決定。</p>
<p>問，院長對靑年黨日前未出席國大補行宣誓事，作何看法？</p>
<p>答，余不聽到靑年黨對此所作說明（記者按，中宣部招待會前，靑年黨曾於原地舉行記者招待會）。</p>

<p>— 本報記者　濮德玠　張明</p>
<p>國大第六次會議，是開會以來最平穩的會，午前由白崇禧主席，他三番兩次地提醒代表們，發言要走到合前，要遵守秩序，雷震在他底左邊，排列發言次序，洪蘭友在他底右邊，靜坐休息。第一組主席團被請了兩次，始終無人上去。</p>
<p>平靜的會中並不乏精采的言論，楊一峯，潘公展，陳顧遠，張知本的發言，都獲得會衆的傾聽，都博得不少掌聲。此外，發言者儘管聽，大都代表們都不聽，或在談天或在看報。狄膺和張默君在論時，張拿出了近作，狄大加稱讚。馬星野在校對他底中央日報把「山海」版徐兆產的一篇「明代的南京」一字一字的從頭看到尾。胡適一度邁着方步慢慢踱出去，慢慢踱回來。大家爲寫意憲。</p>
<p>豫職代表楊一峯發言，開口就說「關於國都的主張共有兩個，一個是南京，一個是北平，我是主張建都北平的！」簡潔爽朗，立即博得大鼓掌。其後列舉理由四點，每說一點即得一陣當聲。記者席上也紛紛鼓舞「到北平去」！建都北平的浪潮川流在每個人的心裏。</p>
<p>遴選代表潘公展首决發言，對憲草修正案提出五點質疑，其中兩點都是關於特別市的。他說：「我是從上海來的，我要替上海市民問問，是不是行政制度裏還要特別市？如果要，那麼特別市選不遷國火代表？特別市的地位又豈能由立法院規定？都應該在憲法中訂個明白。」立即引起熱烈鼓掌，上海各報的攝影記者也都一齊擁上去。</p>
<p>遴選代表陳顧遠開口便說：「我不敢說「行憲」兩字，怕引起「分裂」，不過憲草修正案裏對這點有矛盾的地方，此外其他技術問題很多，條文規定，字句安排，處處欠通。」隨即分條舉例說明。一個例子接受一陣鼓掌，與楊一峯先後輝映，不愧爲立法委員。</p>
<p>遴選代表張知本，是老法學家，一登發言台就得一塲迎頭采。他說：「我們所要制定的憲法，一定要具備進步，完美，合理三個條件，目前的憲草修正案，根本一句話，是應付的，可是這是百年大計的事情，決不能應付……」（大鼓掌）又說：「決不能以「人民程度不够」作藉口，來剝奪人民的政權。世界上只有政府程度不夠，沒有人民程度不夠的。大事業都是靠着人民的力量作成的。舉個例說：政府是開汽車的，人民是坐汽車的。只有開汽車的才有程度問題，會開不會開，沒有說坐汽車的發生程度問題，說那裏會坐不會坐。」掌聲如雷。時開到了，老頭子的話還沒完，照規矩道歉了要想走下來，合下說，「講下去，講下去！」狄膺拿了本議事日程站起來揮着，「請繼續說完！」白主席立即答應延長，老頭子講完了才在掌擊裏走下來。</p>
<p>綏區代表李正樂鬢髮花白，說話慷慨激昂，搖頭擺腦，對蒙旂制度發表意見說：「就綏達一省講，我們對蒙古同胞不但沒有歧視，且已極力優待，省參議員的名額照比例算蒙胞實比漢胞多，納稅出糧的負担，蒙胞則比漢胞少。我主張在行政制度上不應行雙軌。」蒙古代表沒有反響，專門審查蒙藏地方制度的憲草第八審委會已決定成立，他們已得到了勝利。</p>
<p>午前開愈不曾休息，到了十二點正，代表們說：「時間到了」。白主席就宣佈討論暫停，午後續會。雷副秘書長宣佈了靑年黨爲成立紀念而舉行的記者招待茶會，下午一時半從華僑招待所移到國大會堂代表休息室舉行。中宜部的記者招待會兩點鐘在大會堂二樓休息室舉行。正愁着分身乏術的記者們，大家喘了一口氣，笑逐顏開。</p>
<p>工會代表在要求國民大會增加職業團體一款時，同時替婦女團體也提出了這個要求，於是婦女代表席上掌聲如雷。同時更延及全塲，這是今天下午會上最精彩的演說。</p>
<p>主席團女主席劉蘅靜，今天以極穩重的姿態登合發言，給予全塲代表相當尊重的感覺。她發言在孫代表之後，於是在爭取權利時，也爲農工權利特別提了一下，這個呼應來得最好。（十二月二日）</p>

<h3 id="c26">論憲草中之政制 <a href="#c26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>— 陳茹玄</p>
<p>憲草中之國民大會，余旣爲文，有所論列。茲更就憲草中所規定之中央政制及地方政制，略抒所見：</p>
<p>（一）行政院對立法院負責：五五憲草規定行政院院長及各部長均由總統任免。各對總統負責；而總統則由國民大會選舉罷免，對國民大會負責。然國大三年，始集會一次；爲時過久，對於行政之監督。未免鬆懈。總統總攬用人行政之大權，誠恐變爲專制。故修正案乃將行政責任，歸諸行政院長自負。而行政院長之任命，則由總統提名；經立法院之同意行之。行政院應對立法院負責，而其負責方式，則有下列之規定：一·行政院有向立法院提出施政報吿之責，立法委員有向行政院及其各部會質詢之權。二·立法院對行政院重要政策不贊同時，得以決議移請行政院變更之。行政院對立法院之決議，得經總統之核可，移請立法院覆議。覆議時如經出席立法委員三分二維持原決議，行政院院長，應予接受或辭職。三·行政院對於立法院通過之法律案等如認爲窒碍難行時，得經總統之核可，移請立法院覆　。覆議時如經出席立法委員三分二維持原案，行政院院長應予執行，或辭職。此種規定，與五五憲草第七十條「總統對立法院議決案，得於公布前提交立法院覆議？如立法院經出席委員三分二維持原案，總統即應公布執行」之規定，作用大致相同，惟修正案不曰「總統即應執行，」而曰「行政院長應予執行（或接受）或辭職，」蓋意在一方面免除總統與立法院之止面衝突，一方面保證立法院決議案之必予執行，其辦法自亦妥善。惟査五五憲草中有「立法院送請公布之議決案，總統應於三十日內公布」之一條，（第七十條）蓋防有如美國總統，用不公布之方法（即稱爲Pocketveto者是）以抵制國會之流弊；故對公布決議案之時期，特別加以限制。倘逾期不公布，即爲違憲，而違憲行爲，可受彈劾。是立院決議案之執行或接受業有充分保證，行政方面之願意與吾，或辭職與否，均成無足重輕之間題矣。此種安排，亦似未可厚非。至於條正案所規定立法院對行政院之「質詢權」，則因立法院已無信任投票權以倒閣；則所謂「質詢」，自僅係要求行政院解釋申述之意；非可與內閣制國會所有之「質問權」Intepellation相比。蓋「質問權」可以倒閣，面「質詢」之效力，至多等於Questioning已。故修正案中所列舉之總統提交覆議權，立法院對總統任命行政院長之同意權，及行政院對立法院之報吿，與立法院對行政院之質詢大都爲總統制國家之慣例，充其效能，亦只可增進立法行政兩院之關係，決不能造成內閣制之責任政府。故愚意修正案第五十八條「行政院依左列規定對立法院負責」一項，事實上可以删去；而將該條下列三項，併爲一條，似更順理成章也。</p>
<p>（二）中央與地方之分權：五五憲草以縣爲地方自治單位。縣長民選，人民直接行使四權，（即選舉，罷免，創制，複決）而省則不啻爲中央之行政區域。省政府爲執行中央法令，監督地方自治之機關，省長由中央任免。省府及省參議會之組織與職權，以法律定之。至於中央及地方權界之分，則不採用逐項列舉式，僅作原則上片面之規定曰：「凡事務有因地制宜之性質者，劃爲地方自治事項」；而「地方自治事項，則以法律定之」。換言之，即地方自治之權，不列舉於憲法；而受自中央之法令，此純粹之單一制度也。英法諸國大都如此。修正草案則盡反是；將地方自治分爲省，縣二級。省長縣長均由民選；均有民均有民選之議會。最足注意者，則爲中央與省權嚴格之劃分，有由中央立法，中央執行者：如外交，國防，幣制等凡十三款；有由中央立法，可交省執行者：如農林，工鑛，商業，敎育制度等凡十七項；有由省立法並執行或交縣執行者，如省市財政，警察，交通等凡十項，均作詳細之列舉。至於各省之自治法，則不由中央頒布；而由各省召集省民大會自行制定，在不抵觸國憲範圍之內，中央不得干涉。且因其省與中央之權限同列於國家憲法，故省權與中央權爲平行的；在其劃定權限之內，中央與省均不能互相侵犯，倘遇省權有調整必要時，除將國家憲法修改外，別無辦法，非立法院之法律所能處理或變更也。此種分權方法，唯聯邦國家有之。蓋邦權與中央權，同列於國憲；爲聯治制度分權之鐵則。聯邦與單一之分，不在於　　自治權之大小，而在於自治權之來源。單一國家地方之權受　中央；中央之權受自憲法。聯邦國家則中央之權受自憲法，地方之權亦受自憲法。受自中央之自治權，中央得以法律變更之；受自憲法之自治權，其地位與中央權同等，非中央所得而變更也。例如美國聯邦憲法，將中央之權列舉，凡未列舉之權，一槪歸諸各邦States；範圍較廣。又如加拿大聯省憲法，將各省之權列舉，凡未列舉之權一概歸諸中央，故其省自治權之範圍較狹。此兩種分權方法，雖各不同；然因共邦省之自治權均受自憲法，故皆爲標準式的聯治制度。瑞土，德意志，奧大利諸聯邦國大都類此。故修正案之「中央與地方之權限」一章，採用聯邦分權制度者也。（又該章列舉中央與地方權限之方法，完全與民國十二年曹錕時代公布之憲法第五章相同，該憲亦採用聯治主義者也）。又修正案「省縣制度」一章，規定省自治法由各省召集省民代表大會自行制定，除應有民選省長及議會外，一切組織均可自由創制，只須「不得與憲法抵觸」而已。故止要不抵觸憲法，各省之「自治法」，及省政府之組織法，非中央所得過問。此亦唯聯邦國家之邦憲或省憲（如美國各邦之邦憲加拿大各省之省憲均非國會所得修改）始有此特殊地位；至於單一國家，地方自治法規，莫不由國會通過頒布。自治之範團，儘可擴大，權力之來源，則自中央，中央對於地方，永遠保持其監督之地位；此省自治法與省憲法之大別也。今修正案之所謂「省自治法」者，完全由地方創制；中央不能過問。其獨立不　之性質，與聯邦國家之邦憲相同；謂爲「省自治法」，母寧逕稱之爲「省憲法」之名符其實</p>
<p>要之修正案所規定之省制與省權，（即第十及十一兩章）俱充分表現聯邦主義。照此實行，中國當成一聯省國家；故原案第一條應改爲「中華民國爲聯省共和國」；而第十章之「省自治法」，亦應改爲省憲法，則更眉目淸朗，不致有糢糊含混之弊。抑愚於此有不能不鄭重申述者：聯邦主義絕非割據主義，世界任何聯邦國家，莫不有强有力之中央政府，總攬全國外交·軍政·國防·幣制·關稅諸大權。此種關係全國之大權；絕不許地方之干預。就此一點而論，謂聯邦爲統一集權制亦未嘗不可。吾國昔年有主張「聯省自治」之說者，提倡各省獨立，以多元主權，省國平等之理論爲護符，假聯省自治之名，行封建割據之實；是皆聯邦主義之罪人。幸讀者加以分析，切勿張冠李戴。上文所論，藍因見修正案中第十及十一兩章，顯係未明言之聯省制，故不辭反覆爲之指出，以示其與五五憲草不同之點。至於聯省制與單一制，何者爲優，何者較適於我國，淺陋如愚；誠不敢遽下斷語，願識者深思而愼擇焉可耳。</p>
<p>其他比較次要之批評及關於條文上之技術問題者，則以篇幅過長，一時未　盡及。要之憲法爲全國遵守之百年大法，字句務求簡明，條理允應淸楚，絕不容有　混合糊之處，令人難辦雌雄，井然如棋局，昭然如皎日，使行法者如循大道，其平若砥，其直若矢，斯大法之精神得以永久不替耳雖多，而其　　不淸負責懸疣之處，亦復不少。特爲　陳一二，提供高明之參考，並以就正焉。</p>

<p>— 本報通訊員李尙農</p>
<p>自國軍收復宿遷，泗陽，淮陰等蘇北諸重要據點後，盤踞東海縣屬西南鄕的共軍，即吿動搖恐慌，大有崩潰之勢。於是東海縣還鄕　，在倪團長愛棠率領之下，開始向縣境共軍作還鄕性之反擊，計先後收復平明，陳墩，卓王，潑南，上坊，紀蕩，興溝，白沙，下坊，南榴等鄉。</p>
<p>東海縣長周天，縣黨部書記長，靑年團東海分團部書記董立夫，前還鄕團團長倪愛棠等，爲宣慰收復區民衆及明瞭一般情形，以便推行黨政工作，實行救濟起見，爰於十一月二十一日上午九時，在東海縣政府集合，出發收復區，記者亦參與其行。</p>
<p>出城坐黄包車行了二十餘里的旱路，至薔薇河岸，事先準備收了帆船，比時適値風順溜遂，船行似馬。在船面用板上，舉目四矚，遍野已死的秋禾，因被共軍決運河水淹沒，使剩了上梢枯黄枝葉，被風吹搖點頭，田中的永，仍朱完全退落。有幾處田野中的水與河水相連不分，遙望遠處稀疏的農村，點綴在水的中間。</p>
<p>船行蘆葦旁邊，無數的水鳥，被櫓聲警起，冲天而飛，沿河兩岸，漁人設了不少魚罾蟹　，草叢中尙有臘續的秋蟲哀鳴，好似垂死的難民最後呷吟！</p>
<p>至下午三時，抵達新壩，黨政各首長，即召集區長，曁全體民衆訓話，宣達政府對收復區同胞關懷之至意。翌晨復由新壩乘船出發，天氣睛朗，秋色宜人，途經卓王湖，因民衆預先得知，扶老携幼，齊集河岸歡迎，巡慰人員常即令船停靠，魚貫登岸，與地方民衆寒暄，周縣長並致慰問詞。</p>
<p>歡迎的民衆，紛紛自動以筐籃盛鷄蛋，以瓦壺提茶水，向宣慰人員奉獻，各首長以婉詞謝絕後，發船前行。於下午四時，到達上坊，該莊曾四度爲共軍攻佔，皆經我方部隊驅逐，莊內房屋碉堡，均被砲火摧殘，及共軍拆毁，瓦礫遍地，滿目荒涼。</p>
<p>宣慰員，當晚轉道渏水汪莊住宿，第三日拂曉，仍乘船抵平明鄕，登岸召集民衆宣慰後，乃巡視附近各村莊，地方民衆，因遭共軍蹂躪，已成十室九空，衣不蔽體，食不果腹，人民的面上，呈現着采色，見我政府官員到達慰問，牽衣流淚，陳述共軍暴行種種，無不切齒痛恨，聲淚俱下，未能還鄕尙在外流亡的人民，一致環求縣長，發給槍枝，願與共軍一拚死活，打回老家去，好重整他們的田園。</p>
<p>下午本擬向車王等鄕續行，奈逼地皆水，行動頗感困難，故即掉轉船頭返回。</p>

<p>〔中央社新德里一日專電〕印警曁尼赫魯眞納可里漢及辛格一行，已於今晨飛往倫敦。渠等離印後，印度之政治重心隨之暫移英京。印度領袖與英國諸部長間之主要會談，將於三日開始。據倫敦訊：印度諸領袖將被視作全權代表，會議地點將在唐寧街十號。英相艾德禮終以毅力勸得印度黨領袖訪問倫敦，國大黨領袖拒絕邀請，後接受之，回盟主席眞納初接受，繼而躊躇，終同意參加英京會談。眞納接受邀請後，聞艾德禮已予尼赫魯若干保障，乃提出渠訪問倫敦之一項條件。眞納致電艾相謂，除非吾人得討論全部局勢，否則余往倫敦，實無用處。艾相復電曰，閣下之拒絕此行，必由於誤解余致尼赫魯之電文。該電文中並不損礙全部意見之充分老慮。國防部長錫克族代表辛格於離印前談稱：錫克族將抗拒分割印度之任何企岡，內長巴特爾拒絕英國之邀請，昨發表演說謂，印度所遭遇之最大問題，爲如何拒絕社會問題，回盟傾向於一分裂之印度，甚至不惜付流血之代價，其他黨團在任何環境下，均反對分裂，且將不與回盟之策略有染。巴特爾之拒絕邀請，反映國大黨不贊成倫敦會議之態度。消息靈通人士懷疑尼赫魯是否將在未諮商巴特爾及國大黨主席克利巴拉尼之前，即代表國大黨有何作爲，惟若英印領袖能聯合促成議會召開前之制憲會議之協議程序，而使回盟亦能參加會議，則對印度制憲有極大之貢獻。</p>

<p>英國提案內容規定七項建議如下：（一）享有否決權之五常任理事國可於表決前，自行磋商以便取得一致。（二）五常任理事國間如不能取得一致，則其中少數應顧及其自身係與聯合國全體利益行事，故必須於聯合國全體利益有重大影響時，始得行使否決權。（三）五常任理事國應相的不以某稱提案未能盡如我意，而行使否決權。（四）五常任理事國可在安理會提出表決規則，惟此事須於各種辦法均己試行無效後始可提出，提出時亦須採用正當方法。（五）五常任理事國可提議增加安理會議事規則，如在最後討論及表決之前，先組調解委員會之類。（六）爲規定「爭端」之界說，先行商定若干方式以利進行。（七）一常任理事國於表決時棄權，不作行使否決權論，一常任理事國未出席會議因而未參加表決，亦不作行使吾決權論。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕本市因攤販問題引起之騷動事件，經吳市長前晚廣播，剴切曉諭後，昨日情勢已恢復正常，淸晨起，各商店即相繼開市，祗臨近黄浦老閘兩警局之商店則深恐發生意外，開市較遲。淞滬警備司令部實施緊急措置之佈吿於八時後已滿街張點，因之人心益見安定。惟南市十六舖及福佑路菜市，一度爲不良份子企岡搗亂，然卒爲警員及時趕到驅散。</p>
<p>市黨部方主委昨特邀集本市各民衆團體代表，於下午二時在黨部會議室舉行會議，商討此次因攤販問題，而引起騷動事件之善後處置辦法，到市參議會項昌權·記者公會馮有眞·商會江兆武·工會水祥雲·敎育會周斐成·及靑年團支團部·地方協會·婦女協會·學生總會等團體代表曁新聞記者等三十餘人。首由方主委報吿，略謂此次因攤販問題而引起之騷動事件，已由軍警當局全力鎭壓，而告敉平，全市社會秩序今已恢復常態，惟上海爲國內最重要之大都市，治安必須確切保陣，値茲國民大會在京開會期間，竟發生此一不幸事件，殊屬遺憾，今事態已吿平定，亟須商討適當辦法，以謀善後，希望各團體代表盡量發表意見，共同商討。詞畢，由市參議會秘書長項昌權報吿參議會對攤販請願及處理經過，市黨部書記長謝仁釗報吿市黨部臨時執委會議關於處理此次事件之決議案，報吿畢，由各團體代表相繼發表意見，略誌如决：</p>
<h3 id="c77">記者公會提出抗議 <a href="#c77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>記者公會代表馮有眞發言，略謂，此决不幸事件發生後，若干報社記者，竟因執行職務而遭警士毆辱，本人代表新聞記者公會立塲，特向警局提出抗議，此次事件經市府及軍警當局，迅速敉平，殊可嘉慰，惟因此而發生之若干未了問題，必須亟謀解決，例如：（一）攤販問題，希望市府速謀合理解決；（二）希望軍警當局採取有效措置，維護治安秩序，對於此次利用攤販請願機會，擾亂治安，而被警局捕獲之暴徒，希望政府公開審訊；（三）對於若干無辜受暴徒搗毁之商店，尤其是受損最鉅之高生大紙號，谷界人士應發揮人類同情心，贈送慰問金，略資濟助。</p>
<h3 id="c78">責任問題　必須究明 <a href="#c78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>市商會代表汪兆虎發言，謂因此次暴徒搗亂而受損之商店，多爲商會會員，今日已有一二商店向商會呼籲損失賠償，政府似應撥發救濟金，略償彼等所遭損失，至於社會各界贈金慰問，各商店是否接受，固未可知，但係出於人類同情心之發揚，谷受損商店亦可因而獲得精神上之女慰。惟此次事件之善後處理，必須標本兼顧，賠償濟助，僅爲治標，造成此一不幸事件之責任問題，亦必須究明。黄浦分局對於事情發生之初，處理失當，實不能完全辭其咎。商界方面，今日已照常營業，顯示以行動擁護政府維護社會秩序，然亦股切希望，今後不再有類似事件發生</p>

<p>前綫日報王浩提出二點意見：（一）負責執法之軍警，應絕對守法，（二）要求政府對記者採訪新聞，發表新聞，予以有效之保障。主君發言畢，適參議員王先靑氏到會。方主委即請王氏報吿上月三十日代表市參議會前往黄浦分局調査事態眞相而致被毆之經過。王氏當作詳盡報吿，證明當時警士行動確有失當之處，認事態之所以擴大，該分局應負相當責任。嗣由謝書記長報吿事態擴大，確係有人乘機煽動羣衆，擾亂治安，企圖造成慘案及恐怖局面。例如當時羣衆所喊口號中竟有「國民黨製造第二次五卅慘案」之詞句，即足充分證明絕非攤販或其家屬所爲而係具有政治作用，有組織有計劃的非法暴行。謝氏報吿畢，由新夜報孫東城，總工會水祥雲，市黨部周濂澤，敎育會周斐成等相繼發表意見，僉認警察紀律，必須力謀改善，不容任意毆打人民，同時政府各項施政，應在事前周密考慮其所可引起之影饗，鄭重執行，以免發生問題。</p>

<p>方主委於各代表發言畢，發表意見，要點爲：（一）取締攤販，政府事前對宣傳工作，未盡力做到，黨部及黨員力面，亦未克盡協助宣導之責，（二）拘捕攤販覇押多日，其家　請願釋放，原屬必然後果，當局事前應預爲計慮，而謀適當處理辦法，以免爲人造謠煽動，（三）黄浦分局釋放攤販時，應在羣衆包園時，當衆釋出，並向羣衆公開宣布，則攤販家屬必相率散出，野心暴徒即無機可乘，（四）當羣衆包圍譁擾時，警察僅開空槍鎭壓，確已盡最大之忍耐，殊可嘉許，至於事態擴大，顯係暴徒利用機會，企圖造成流血慘案及恐怖局面，以遂其破壞治安，擾亂社會秩序之陰謀，今事件得以迅速解決，並未釀成流血慘劇，足證政府及軍警當局力足維護治安，暴徒計劃實已完全失敗，惟今後本市治安問題，仍値得全市市民及市府軍警機關密切注意，警覺戒備。</p>
<h3 id="c81">擬成議案 <a href="#c81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>方主委繼歸納各代表意見，擬成決議案六項：（一）政府應即日選擇適當空闊而不妨碍交通之塲所，暫准攤販營業，以維生計，而攤販在營業時，亦應注意整飭，以維市容。（二）此次拘押人員中之無辜受累者，應從速査明釋放，其假借攤販名義，而乘機擾亂治安之暴徒，應從速公開分別審訊，凡證據確實者，應依法嚴辦，以示政府除暴安良之決心。（三）警察局對收存攤販之什物，應即日分別淸還。（四）被暴徒搗毀之各商店尤其資本微薄之高生大紙號，黨部政府以及本市各團體，應寄以最大之同情，贈送慰問金，其被暴徒毆傷之無辜市民，亦應分別慰問賑恤。（慰問金由上海中央日報代收）（五）黄浦分局發生事件，應請政府澈底査究。（六）時値冬令，請政府軍警機關切實注意冬防，以維治安。當經全塲一致通過。該項決議案，市黨部已於昨晚函送市政府査照辦理。</p>

<p>上海市黨部主任委員方　，昨晨赴黄浦分局訪語杜分局長，　詢此次不幸事件之經過，時該局正將攤販之各種貨物加以淸理，準備發還。方氏復於上午十時卅分，偕謝書記長陳處長前赴各受書商家　問，首至金陵東路高生大紙號，時適店主高成錫不在，由經理呂學成接待。方氏等繼又至大新公司慰問。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕對於此次騷動事件，吳市長特於昨日發表感想，認爲警察對於市民之態度必需改善，軍警對此事件之忍耐精神則表示嘉慰。略謂：（一）關於取締攤販問題，當局極爲愼重，對於此次因而引起之騷動事件，純爲陰謀暴動者，企圖造成慘案，負責治安者，處理煞費苦心。陰謀者於上星期六晚在中區鬧市搗毁商店，破壞交通等行動，完全企圖擴大事態，逼成罷市罷工，以遂其煽惑及造成恐怖政策之目的。本人當時發令軍警，絕對不許開槍，故在無可如何中，僅開放木壳空槍，對於軍警之忍耐精神，表示嘉慰。（二）市府取締黄浦老閘二區攤販目的，爲維持鬧市交通。此項措施，並無錯誤可言，且曾以五個月之期限，令各攤販遷地營業，另謀生計，充分表示示政府曾顧到攤販之生計。謠傳所稱：被拘押之攤販有餓斃及凍死情事，絕非事實。但警察局中一部份下級職員，曾在租界時期服務，經甄別留用者，或不免渲染習氣，今後對於市民之態度，當予改善。本人將在市政會議中提出訓誡市府及各局所有執行公務人員，應保持公務員爲市民公僕及當爲市民服務之精神。末謂此次騷動事體，至前日下午止，已吿一段落，昨晨各警察分局派警分別勸導各商店照常營業，於九時許，市面秩序完全恢復常態。但滋事之陰謀者，現仍存在，無論工商學各界，均廳確實認識，共同協助政府，防制騷動，俾達到安定社會秩序之目的。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕日前暴徒利用攤販事件，乘機滋事，搗毁店家。記者昨日往訪二十七家遭殃的店舖，（包括百貨公司，戲院，酒店，旅館，舞廳，藥房，水菓店，印刷所）調査損失情况。總共被毁各種大小玻璃一百九十七塊，總　二億三千餘萬元，外加零星貨物損失，高生大號被燒毁之生財貨物二億元，和未及調査的遭殃店舖，此次不幸事件，直接造成的損失，在法幣五億元以上。至於各種間接的損失，包括全市店家所遭受的營業損失，那數目就大得難以估計了。</p>
<p>河南南路有一家大新鮮果行，十二月一日新開張，剛剛做了幾筆安易，忽然擁來大批不出錢的顧客，把橘子，蘋果，梨啊，拿了就朝袋要送。突然一聲喊打，裝糖炒栗子的釭給砸碎了，磅秤給敲扁了，霓虹燈，鏡框，和八塊玻璃窗都打毀了。夥計們忙着上脾門，儘管手忙脚快，結果還有一塊牌門失蹤，這時斜對門還有一家沒打烊的老萬鑫菜館，又成了暴徒的標的，煎鍋貼的鑊子給扔在馬路中央，白鷄，燒鴨，鹵味等，都給拋掉。兩家的損失，約達二百萬元。</p>
<p>黃河路有家博愛藥房，也是一日新開市，到了下午三點多鐘，正有不少太太小姐們在採購化裝品和補藥，突然擁來數百暴徒，敲碎玻璃窗四塊，霓虹燈八隻，和櫥窗中許多液體藥品，門口陳列的許多花籃，都成了暴徒的武器，全部損失達二千萬元。</p>
<p>其他店家被搗毁的，多爲各種玻璃：有橱窗玻璃，大門玻璃，招牌玻璃，小窗玻璃。這些玻璃有英國貨，有德國貨，有美國貨。最大的玻璃，要八百多萬元一塊，最小的也在一萬元以上。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕昨晨九時許，警察局長宣鐵吾微服出巡，視察全市治安情形，並至各警察分局聽取報吿。宣氏首赴出事地點之黄浦分局，繼又分赴泰山，新成，老閘等局，對各區戒備措置，頗爲滿意。十時許，記者遇官局長於老閘分局，承答覆詢問稱：「此次動亂中，所獲嫌疑人犯，現正嚴予偵査中。凡煽動風潮及縱火搞亂之不良份子，一經査實，決依照戒嚴法辦理。若經查明確係無辜被累者，當將其具保釋放。至於事件中遭受槍傷者，確係貧困無吿之人，業送公家醫院療治，其醫藥費用，將由市府負担，至治愈爲止。惟趁機肇事搗亂之不良份子，雖死不足惜」。宣局長末對本市治安，表示軍警力量雄厚，絕對可以無慮。深望市民安居樂業，毋相驚擾。</p>

<p>各店家多數已呈報警局，聽候當局處置。不過，新新公司的玻璃窗是保過險的，但保險公司說：暴徒揭毁的，不負賠價責任。雙方尙在交涉中。</p>

<p>（一）中華烟廠：先由工人提出年賞二百萬元之要求，經資方拒絕後，曾一度罷工。後社會局限工人於廿四小時內復工，然後再談年賞之事。現工人已遵令復工，但工作情緒不佳，此事定明日在社會局調處，廠方態度甚爲堅抉，不願接受要求，但盼在社局主持下，尋求合理之解決途徑。</p>
<p>（二）沙利文糖果餅乾製造廠：工人亦要求改善待遇，具體要求如下：（一）每人每月加發生活補助費十五萬元。（二）本月份加發年賞三月。（三）每月不停工者賞四工。（四）補發戰前存工五天。（五）例假日工作須發給雙薪。（六）廠方每日供給一餐。此事於上月二十九日提請社會局調處，目前尙未解決。</p>
<p>（三）華一毛紡染織廠。工人要求提高工資及改善福利，其具體條件爲：（一）工資。目前最高工資爲每月十萬元，普通者不過五萬元左右；現要求提至最高二十萬元，普通者十五萬元左右。（二）星期例假及國定紀念日，放假應照給工資。（三）如遇斷電時，工資之支付應按照勞資評斷會公佈之辦法實施。（四）女工分娩期內之待遇，應依照工廠法辦理。（五）工人如因公受傷時，藥醫費應由廠方負責，工資亦應照給。（六）不得無故開除工人及工人代表。（七）每日工作時閒規定爲十小時，超過時須按比例另給報酬。此項糾紛於十月十八日發生，昨日勞資雙方代表在社會局談判，雙方對提高工資一點，迄未獲致協議。</p>
<p>（四）美商德士古石油公司：職工聯合向廠方要求改善待遇，條件內容頗爲廣泛，其要點如下：（一）職工之底薪，因生活費用日漲，要求一律提高百分之五十。（二）職工底薪在一百元以下者，應按工人生活指數計數；在一百元以上者，應按職員生活指數支。（三）本年舊曆年發給雙薪一月。（四）每日工作時間以八小時爲限，超過者應加倍支薪。（五）職工無分中外，一律按級待遇，以昭大公。（六）職工如有病痛，公司應負担醫藥費用。（七）職工年老或疾病退休時，公司應一次發給退職金及養老金。（八）公司不能無故開除職工。（九）公司應添造職工宿舍。（十）每月配售火油一次，應一律辦理。（十）（一）凡工人服務滿三個月者，應作爲長工論。此事於十月二十三日提請社會局調處，德士古公司對於勞方各項條件，已有書面答覆送局；對於改善薪給要求，允於調查生活費用後辦理；對於改善員工福利事允酌辦；至於發給退職金養老金之要求，謂須商之公司各董事，始能答覆。有若干點則措辭籠統而不肯定，解決尙有待。</p>
<p>（五）跑馬總會：工人昨日在社會局痛陳西人態度之横暴惡劣，其具體要求爲：（一）工資按生活指數計算，分三級支付：甲級爲五十五元，乙級爲五一‘元，丙級爲四十五元。（二）新待遇標準自十月份起實行。（三）不得藉故開除工人及工人代表。（三）工人應有退職金。服務滿三年者應得六個月之退職金；滿五年者十個月；滿十年者一年；其由資方提議解　者，退職金應加倍發給。（五）工人生病，其醫藥費由資方負担，病假時期工資不扣。工人有病時得向資方借支三月。（六）工人之福利設施，費用由勞資兩方平均負担。（七）資方僱用新人時，應先向工會僱用失業工人。（八）職工於年底發給雙薪。此事尙在社局調處中，解決有待。</p>
<p>（六）大公染織廠前取消修造部，解僱工人三十一名，勞資發生衝突。經社局調處後，解僱工人每人發給解僱費一月，還鄕費一個半月，已吿解決。</p>
<p>（七）聞中央印鑄廠工人要求發給年賞，但尙未提請社會局調處。</p>
<p>社會局趙班斧處長對於工人要求年賞事，强調社局正使工人澈底明瞭年賞於法無據，完全爲情商問題。工廠有　有盈，豈能強其一律出豆額年賞？至於干涉工廠之用人權，更爲不當。社會局處理此事，當根據「勞資並存」之原則，不壓迫勞方，但亦不能聰工廠關門。社局一年來調處勞資糾紛之政策，爲提倡勞資合作，此實爲我國工業唯一之出路。</p>
<p>又記者昨晤工會職員某君，據稱：本市機器業技工所組織之「機匠研究社」，已決定要求發給年賞六個月。工人對於年賞之態度，爲資方多賺多要，少賺少要，並無逼倒工廠之意。</p>

<p>〔本報特寫〕四代祖傳，創辦了九十九年的高生大箋紙印刷號。這次不幸的而且無辜的慘遭暴徒一再尋　，全部生財機器焚燒的焚燒，搗毁的搗毁，而且連衣服被褥都被搶走一空，損失總數在二萬萬以上。前日第二次在暴徒横行時，雖經小店主跪地磕頭數百下之多，苦苦衰求，非但得不到暴徒一絲同情，反要把他鄉入火中去燒，幸而經夥計們硬把他拉住躱避，始免於難。</p>
<p>滿地都是玻璃紙屑　昨日下午，記者從滿地紙屑，踏上高生大的二樓，在一間小房間內，所有玻璃窗都被打成一個個洞。在那邊見到了他們的營業主任呂學誠，老闔高成錫因事外出，老闆娘哭紅了雙眼，蓬着頭，坐在床沿上頻頻擦眼淚。這時小店主高鵬雲（見圖）也來把詳細經過情形吿訴記者。高鵬雲是同德醫學院五年級學生，同時在仁濟醫院實習，是高生大的第四代店主，也就是向暴徒磕頭衰求的一位。</p>
<p>根據被害人的報吿，詳情如下：上月三十日上午十一時，呂學誠等在店內就看見一羣年的二十多歲的流氓樣的男子在門口嚷着：「要擴大事情，一定先要斷絕交通」，於是這一羣人就到近旁中華里搬了幾塊大石頭放在電車軌道上，後經一輛電車司機和他們交涉半天才放他過去，可是接着的電車都不准通行，於是秩序越來越亂，警察開了一輛吉普車來干涉，被石子亂擲，頓時事態擴大。高生大見到情勢緊張，在下午三點多就把牌門全部上起。到六時許，正預備吃晚飯時，祗聽下面有人大駡：「把開水澆在我頭上，豈有此理，打，打，打！」接着跟着許多人都鬧着「打，打，打」，就這樣肇起滔天大禍。記者曾追問「究竟有否倒水」。但店主店夥都堅決否認，說祗有屋簷上水管損壞，積着的雨水不斷滴下，又自玻璃窗被石子擲破後，碎玻璃片落下來傷了人的頭。</p>
<p>趕快出去馬上放火　高大生的排門被闖破後，呂學誠見一位穿制服的人領頭進來，起初以爲是當局派人來彈壓，可是一聽他形勢汹汹問他是什麽人，經吿訴他是店中工人，這個冒充軍人就說：「趕快出去，馬上放火燒」。同來的人竟說要把「長脚」（即呂學誠）從窗外擲出去，幸旁邊一人開玩笑把他放過。老闆娘堅不肯走，最後始行退出，這時老闆正在人家吃酒。</p>
<p>暴徒們一批批的把店內帳簿，文具，鉛字，都搠出去一堆堆放在馬路上燒，機器，印刷房都被搗毀，連工人的被頭舖蓋都被搶去，到晚上十一時始吿停歇。當晚由工人守夜，警局派四名警士巡夜，最後剩一人防守，搗剩的排門仍將就地掩拼起來。</p>
<p>前日上午，高生大化了十一萬元的工費（竹籬笆不計在內還　賠償）把籬笆築起，不幸到了下午三時半，一窩風的暴徒竟開了一輛卡車光臨，車上都是靑年人，領班的穿了件皮領短外衣，一停車就指揮他們拆籬笆，嘴裏還嚷着：「居然搭起籬笆來，拆掉它，再燒，燒，燒，燒！」</p>
<p>小主跪求險遭活燒　這時店內上下人都躱在二樓擱樓內，大批暴徒直衝而上，就此把全部紙册，帳簿付之一炬。小店主見他們衝上二樓，爲了要保全二樓財產，連連向他們確頭設請他們千萬勿再搗毀二樓，店面則由他們破壞可也。起初還有人饒了他，暫時歇手，到了傍晚，人愈來愈多，小店主再跪在門外磕頭跪拜，無論怎樣，也不能打動暴徒們的心腸，反說他是當過軍官的，要把他拋在火中燒，夥計們急了，忙把他拉開，呌他不要再求，始免於難。結果，把八架印刷　器全部搗毁，切紙刀架搬在路上切鐵條，四千磅的鉛字滿街亂飛，趁火打劫的人們把喜歡的東西裝滿了袋口塲長而去，笨重的就打爛了四面擲，包車和自行車各一輛，也成了火中的餘儘，舖蓋捲則被裝了三輛三輪車而去，等到警察來干涉，救火員數次來救火，都被阻止，無法進行。</p>
<p>關於善後問題，老闆急得走頭無路，祇能打掃整理，預備把大門木板釘起，暫吿停業，一面則呈請紙業公會轉市商會呼籲。吳市長曾於昨日上午十時召見高成錫，表示市政當局未能堡護週到，深感抱歉，因當時秩序紊亂，警士不能任意彈壓，希望明瞭情形，所受損失，將來決設法補償，並特以私人名義捐助一百萬元，備加安慰。方主任委員亦前往　問稱：奉主席命趕返向各界慰問，將舉行募捐辦法，以賠償該號損失。</p>
<p>記者在臨走時候，聽聽小店主最後的幾句衷心話，「我們開紙頭店的，全靠年底帳簿出售，我們冬天的帳簿都在夏天做好的，現在製成品全部焚毁，即要做起來也來不及了！」</p>

<h3 id="c99">靜安寺和尚爭來法院旁聽　德悟密迦漢奸嫌疑案昨午再審一堂　五教員證言分兩派 <a href="#c99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕靜安寺住持僧德悟，監院密迦，漢奸嫌疑案，昨日下午再度由高院開庭調査，傳詢前靜安小學敎員李浩然，顧龍車，徐宏翰，姚紹秀，陳志新五證人。並提訊兩被吿。靜安寺僧到庭旁聽者甚衆，五證人之供詞前二人有利被吿，後三人則不利被吿。完全相背，庭訊自三時起至五時半始畢，主審推事楊鼎諭吿改期再訊，被吿還押。</p>
<p>李浩然稱卅二年八月進靜安寺小學担任敎職，直至卅四年五月辭退，該校並非靜安寺所辦，另由校董會負責，學校地基則係靜安寺所捐，密迦祖任常務校董，德悟爲校董，同朋日語學校創立於卅一年，直至卅四年四五月關門。當時因“人勢力甚大，欲接收靜安小學，幾經交涉，結果始商定借用敎室開辦日語夜校，該校是否係敵興亞院所辦，本人不詳。但木牌所寫係日本東本願寺主辦。德悟密迦並不担任敎課，校長爲日人木下萬淺，但不常來。學校與靜安寺有牆隔開，有一小門可通，但不常開。其他靜安寺舉辦慰靈法會等事，因我信天主敎，平時不顧問，故不詳。</p>
<p>顧龍章稱卅二年八月至卅四年八月向在靜安小學担任敎員，該校本附設寺內，後由寺方捐地自建校舍，德悟密迦皆爲校董，同朋日語學校之招生廣告，畢業文憑及木牌上營稱是東木願寺所辦，密迦德悟並非日語學校校董，庭上詢以兩被告與日人來往及靜安寺舉辦法會之事，顧皆答稱不知。</p>
<p>徐宏翰稱在靜安小學担任事務主任及敎職共十七年，至去年七月底辭職，密迦德悟兩人在太平洋戰後，卅二年十一月始利用日人勢力出任靜安小學校董，同朋日語學校由東本願寺與靜安寺合辦，在卅一年四月强借小學敎室，由日僧担任校長。水電用靜安小學，但費用則由靜安寺撥付，平時密迦德悟常去視察，開學放學時亦去演講，敎員皆爲日人，招生廣吿上寫明在日本大使館備案云云。言畢即將檢舉人謝錫卿帶來之日語夜校第八屆招生廣吿出示庭上，該廣吿牌高五尺左右共兩塊，其一之背面，且貼有「日本明治節休假一天」之佈吿。</p>
<p>姚紹秀稱廿二年二月至卅四年七月底，在靜安小學担任總務主任兼敎員，該校在抗戰前並無校董，至太平洋戰後，密迦德悟兩人憑藉敵僞勢力一定要加入校董會，至卅二年十一月出任校董，密迦在進靜安寺前，在虹口主持西竺寺，與東本願寺往來素密，遂借勢進靜安寺，並創辦日語學校。卅一年四月德悟密迦會同東本願寺日僧，興亞院憲兵隊人員，及僞靜安寺警察分局日警長杉崎，保甲部主任崎谷等，至靜安小學强佔，此後名義上雖稱西寺合辦，但實際皆由德悟密迦負責，校長志峯祇是傀儡，祇在卅一年六月創辦時來過一次，開學典禮時志峯先演講，繼之爲密迦德悟，密迦蘭述創辦意義爲欲將中日滿思想打成一片，文化溝通。德悟則稱：上海今日能如此安定全賴日人維持，你們學好日語可介紹進日本機關做事。此外靜安寺舉辦佛敎講座，曾請陳彬龢講過，本人講話可具結，如有誣證，可請辦罪云。並呈上證件兩件。</p>
<p>陳志新稱廿六年戰起直至卅二年二月一段時間內，在靜安小學任敎員兼訓育主任，卅一年四日密迦曾同日人來強佔，日語夜校畢業文憑上之校長雖爲志峯，但上有天下有地，中有良心，實際係由密迦負責，德悟僅是傀儡。靜安寺與靜安小學間之小門，在同朋口語學校成立後方開，密迦不但在同朋演講，亦來靜安小學演講，都說「大東亞戰爭」怎樣怎樣，本人實在氣不過云。言時甚爲激憤。</p>
<p>被告供詞</p>
<p>五證人詢問畢，楊推事乃命帶上德悟，密迦，德悟衣灰布玄裝，面色淸瘦，對檢舉人出示之兩日語學校招生木牌答稱：假使要吿我，他們可自己寫，所稱供給同朋一切經費，絕對無此事，靜安寺與靜安小學之間小門，亦早在同朋日語學校未辦前已開云。密迦則衣黑色僧衣辯稱：根本未參加同朋担任任何職務，檢舉人所提招生廣吿可用紙寫，不足憑證。靜安寺亦祇有補助小學經費，並未補助日語學校經費，所謂欲加之罪，無患無詞，法令須重事實，徐姚陳三證人挾嫌誣證，亦請庭上參酌前兩證人之意見。檢舉人之一仰西和尙在敵僞時期曾說我們是重慶份子，因而皆被敵憲兵隊拘押過。勝利後又說我們是漢奸，最近又聽說六根等要强進靜安寺，故檢舉是假，爭財產才　　云。</p>
<p>請求交保</p>
<p>被吿之辯護律師對不利被吿三證人所提出之證據加以駁斥，稱顯係僞證，又因今日靜安寺寺　料紛正起，乏人主持，故請求庭上仍准予交保。密迦亦稱：決無逃亡之愛，庭諭書面其狀聲請，待本院合議庭裁定。被吿仍還押，退庭時已萬家燈火。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕地院昨審理一勝利前偽特工搶奪美金及恐赫案。緣於民國三十四年秋間，有猶太人哈德門，斯比羅兩人，暗中賣買美金。其時日軍對美金及法幣取締甚嚴，於是有僞特工姓陳，姓范二人，託一煤球店老闆吳其賢者，向猶太人僞稱擬購美金二百元，並稱領往取款，誘至霍山路大速灣路口，由陳范二人上前將美金抄出劫去，並至斯比羅之家抄査，又搜去美金二百八十餘元，及僞中儲券八十餘萬元。事後經哈，斯二人報吿僞法院。然僞法院延不審理。至昨日，始由地院初次開庭。以事隔多時，需再收集證據，庭諭改期十二月十一日再審。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕新新公司總經理李澤，勝利後被該公司職工舒月橋等檢舉，指有漢奸嫌疑，經本市高院審結，判處有期徒刑三年。被吿奉判不服，由其妻李劉兆興具狀南京最高法院，聲請覆判，經該院裁定，認爲原判不當，乃將該案發還更審，現本市高院已定於明日下午開庭更審。</p>
<p>最高法院判決發還更審之理由爲：（一）關於聘任日人伊籐益三及木下豐爲顧問，被吿有無與敵軍接洽事宜，是否委託顧問辦理之事實及如何內容，是否承認爲通謀敵風有不利於本國之企圖，原判均未加以說明，是爲疏漏之處。（二）原判未依法實施調査程序，向被吿宣讀，或吿以要旨，詢其有無意見，予被吿以辦解之機會。（三）原判所引用僞南京政府頒佈戰時經濟法令，及偽商統會暫行條例與中日共同宣言，未說明其根據。被吿事前旣無所知，無從以之爲對象而加以辯解。</p>
<p>又李澤案檢舉人舒月橋，韓武成，葉秋彬，徐可康等，以李澤將於明日由高院刑二庭更審，特於昨日下午二時在逢吉里十六號新新公司同人聯誼會招待新聞界，並發表致國大代表及市參議會公開信，其中列舉李澤之罪行，並強調其曾獻鐵資敵二萬多斤，請求發揚正氣而主持公道，該信已於昨晚發出。又悉舒月橋，韓武成等已請辯護律師沙千里擬就訴呈，當於開庭時，親呈楊鼎推事，以作確證云。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕第四期第一次國民營各紗廠聯合配銷復製黨之棉紗，昨日開始發配。惟配紗各情，視前稍有變更。（一）各支紗折合廿支紗之比例推算，因以前所定推算表，不甚準確，經再番精密統計，另定新比例推算表。（二）國民營各廠攤派配紗額，改以各廠實開紗錠數爲標準。依紡建開工紗錠七〇九·三一六枚，民營各廠開工紗綻一·〇一一·八〇九枚計算，紡建應攤配紗總額爲五分之二强，民營各廠應攤五分之一弱。（三）按原定議價，四十二支單股報件爲二百七十七萬元，四十二支雙股每件爲二百七十九萬元，相差二萬元，顯有未合，常按生產成本，另訂四十二支雙股新價爲每件三百四十六萬元，呈由紡管會核准後施行。</p>
<p>昨日國民營各紗廠聯合配銷棉紗總額爲五一八一件，合廿支紗六一六〇·二六件。此中六支紗卅件，十支六八四件，十六支四一五件，廿支二九四〇件，卅二支二七〇件，卅二支雙股一五〇件，四十支TK一三〇件，四十支一一九件，四十二支雙股四三六件，六十支七件。</p>

<p>外幣由堅回疲，晨初美鈔四九二〇元至四九七〇元，中途復迫近五〇〇〇元光景，後以金市回落，亦受影響，午刻降低至四九〇〇元以下，午後雖升而不多，在四九〇〇元左右盤旋，結果較上週六微挫，港匯因申電下落及西商扒結炎故，昨升高至九七〇元以上，印匯一一八〇兀，英匯一五八〇〇元有售，美匯牌價未更，對做仍無。</p>

<h3 id="c169">建設南昌示範市 <a href="#c169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>— 四日訊　本報南昌記者劉藻</p>
<p>戰爭燬壞了南昌，但是新的南昌，又在戰後復典，中央爲重建南昌，特劃爲示範市，行總城市專家斐特，內政部科長沈爾明，內政部營建司司長哈雄文，先後來到南昌實地勘察，並由應新市長於哈司長等在省勘察時，召集各界有長舉行座談會，對於怎樣建設南昌元範市的建設方案，曾有詳盡的商討，斐特對於整個的建設方案，主張在原計劃的第一，第二工業區，酌增住宅區，又在城南住宅區，另增工業區，俾資折衷。下水道的原計劃，係由東西二湖，流入靑嵐湖，再納入贛江，斐特却主張由城北納人贛江，並將靑嵐湖四週劃爲風景區，老飛機塲劃爲行政區，將現有的介石公園擴大爲中央公園，東西兩湖的四週，都劃爲公園。</p>
<p>怎樣建設新的南禺呢？這裏願就建設草案述述要介紹，以供關心市政建設者作個參考。</p>
<p>市區現况　原有建設計劃</p>
<p>戰後的南昌，是一具殘廢肢號，原有的四五二一四棟高大的店房與住宅，被戰爭的砲火摧燬了三五二〇五棟，損失的總和，是佔原有房屋的百分之七十五，戰爭燬壞了南昌，戰後更應該建設新的南昌。</p>
<p>南昌現有的市區在贛江東岸，街道的改建，已經具備了優良新市政的模型，市區中央，有四個湖，市的中心，是在湖岸的四週與贛江之濱，所以南昌市區是盆地。</p>
<p>市區與外界交通，水路有贛江的無數帆船與火輪，陸路有南潯，浙贛與贛湘鐵路和幾條公路，向北延伸的南潯鐵路公路，是以贛江西岸的牛行爲起點，向南分行東西的浙贛與湘贛路，則以贛江東岸爲起點，東西兩岸的交通，經中正橋互相啣接，使整個江西的交通動脈貫通，完成了靈活的交通網。</p>
<p>南昌的市政建設方案，早就有了詳盡的計劃，此一方案的擬就，是以南昌市的人口，未來必然的增加，與工業亦必自然日趨發展爲出發點，但是根據斐特的勘察，他却認爲南昌人口的大量增加問題，如工業不能作合理的發展，那末，人口亦就朱有迅速顯著的增加，南昌雖爲行政中心，省會所在地，但是，這不能成爲使人口有長足增加的理由，對於事業的分區，斐特主張照原計劃稍有改正，依照現有的劃分方案，有三個工業區，第一區在贛江西岸，第二區在城北贛江中半島之上，第三區在贛江東岸，城北區之一部，住宅區亦有三區，商業區一區，行政區一區，文化區一區，至水上公路，鐵道，空中交通糸統的改進，在這個原計劃裏，尙未計及。</p>
<p>設計原則　重建市區問題</p>
<p>新市區的建設方案，是依照兩個原則：（一）被燬市區的重建，（二）南昌集團市區的未來發展。這兩個階段。必須相互配合，蓋設計重要集團的中心，而對各附　區域的組織無確切的認識，自不可能，各該區域的分佈位置多寡等等，則又以其商業中心的狀况爲轉移。</p>
<p>再以南昌狀况而言，對於未來人口，不能有確切的佔計，其設計則以依照分佈原則爲宜，是即將整個集團市區劃分爲若干相互爲用的分區，而以現有的市區爲自治中心，其决每分區須建築區分所，郵政分局，警察分局，小學，如屬可能，亦應設立中學，在現有市區中心，應儲備與築市立大學的地基，蓋是項機構，不應設於任何分區之內運用此種分佈原則，即可着手建設現有南昌市區中心，而不須預留較大空曠地基，作爲建築區署與學校等等的必要，如依照同心原則發展，則此爲不可避免的事實，是不特遭受地價的不經費，且有碍觀瞻。市區重建計劃，自當由市區內的四湖着手，並將湖區併入公園，將現有的介石公園，擴充爲中央公園，但其先決條件，則爲覓得適當地皮，交換被公園佔用的私有地產。城東的老飛機塲，已是失去效用，有的人主張以此基地，作爲交換之用。</p>
<p>中央公園的四週，須興修寬廣馬路，環繞公園，並須與其他交通綫作適宜的連絡，其首要者，則爲沿園馬路路而北角，與横跨贛江中正橋的連絡綫。</p>
<p>在沿園馬路與中央公園之糊，可建造房屋兩排，是項房屋，能窺見公園中的一切景物，其環境的豳美雄偉，自不難想見。　原有的環城路，是將來的商業區，該區的中央，有寬廣的商場，環城路沿贛江之一段，已向南北延長，預計將來可成爲沿江大道。</p>
<p>因係採用分佈原則設計，故將設置文化區的意旨打銷，但在老飛機塲範圍內，則應保留修建市立大學的地基，機塲範圍內大學地基之南，即爲擬設的行政區，以中國官舍慣習，類皆南向，故行政區幹路，則擬順機塲的南界修建一部官舍，可由此幹路逕達，其他可經由平行的小道。及庭院。</p>
<p>在行政區之南，擬設一城區火車總站，並在其附近設汽車總站，火車總站與汽車總站前的廣塲，由市區的交通幹路銜接，爲求火車站有適當的車塲，向南開川的軌道，應向東移，且軌道遷移後，將有下列的兩項便利將來市區集團的擴充，不致受軌道的限制或横黃，如此，則勘覓未來聯絡南北兩條鐵路的大橋地基，更爲便利。</p>
<p>市區下水道的設法改建尤須特別注意。市區的最低地段爲市中央，全市大部溝水，必須流至市中心區，然後用抽水機排人江中，其出口處，以在市區的最下游爲妙，其詳細設計，應由衛生工程專家詳細硏究後，實施較爲妥　。斐特建議築一地下儲水池，在尋常狀况下能有緩衝容量，池設溢口，在大雨的時激增水量，得以由溢出洩人湖中，此冲淡至相當程度的溝水，不致再有使湖水污穢之虞。</p>
<p>現在水電廠的位置，不能與將來人口增加面應付人民的所需，因爲該廠附近並無空擴地皮作爲未來擴充之用，應該在計劃的工業區內，任擇一地重建大模範的水電廠，並且須所意電廠的取水與供應。</p>
<p>南昌市米來發展的重點，是工業區與住宅區的劃定與籌建，現在擇定的工業區，擬設於市區北部，此外沿向南行公路的附近另設一次要的工業區，從事輕工業的建設，第一，二，工業區分別位於贛江之東西岸，水上交通，極其便利。</p>
<p>第一工業區，位於贛江西岸，地勢甚高，岸邊且有淺灘，在水位低下時，完全露出水面，惟該區距幹流有相當距離，補救的方法，乃建疏濬淺河，修建運河港口伸入區內。以利水上交通，是項運河的保養，須要經常疏濬如設計優良，所費不致龐大。</p>
<p>在第一工業區之西，擬設火車綫，站，庫，由此得與各種工業取得聯絡。</p>
<p>第二工業區，位於贛江東岸，與第一區相反，該區地勢極低，水位高時，落於水平綫下，應有堤防護，是以本區亦有修建伸入河道穿過堤岸的必要，又以地勢太低，是項河道，必須備具水閘，調節水位，藉防水位高時，遭受湮沒之廬。</p>
<p>河港及工廠的大小，與第一區相同，一切以中等規模爲對象，並應參酌實際情形，作適宜的發展，伸人河這的大小地點，亦須經水利實　後，確定在此區內，並須在最上游準備修建，將來較大規模水電廠的地基，方可免及水電之水，被工廠排洩的穢水所汚。</p>
<p>住宅區將來就附設在工業區附近，得以縮短工廠與員工住宅的距離，原有分區計劃的缺點，就是因爲距離太遠，依照斐特的新方案，第一住宅區應在贛江西岸，設一個區，作爲西岸工業區員工之用。該區與工業區及南九，南萬公路田前述的草坪，劃分隔離，據斐特的意見，這塊草坪並非用作公園，故不致鑄成任何損失，土地的原有價値，亦能保持</p>
<p>第二住宅區，擬設於第二工業區之南，供該區員工之居住。</p>
<p>第三住宅區，擬設於城之正北，並不與任何工業區接連，僅就原有的城北住宅區，加以擴充，該區適宜於收入較豐的居民。</p>
<p>第四住宅區，擬設於行政區與市立大學之東北東兩面，以改建向南通行鐵道棧爲界，南面則以新建的火車總站倉庫，此區擬供原居在新中央公園範圍內住宅之居民居用。</p>
<p>在市中心區與第四住宅區之南，擬另設居處兩所，一處可作在鐵道綫以東之第三工業區，次工之居住。</p>
<p>最後南昌市區東南地區，爲新機塲所據，依照一九四六年蒙垂沃會議的決定，在機塲四週應有相當空隙地帶，不得建築房屋，及架設電綫等障碍，故該地皮之用途，應以農田爲宜。</p>
<p>建設方案　今後怎樣實施</p>
<p>這個新建設方案的實施，亦須分成兩部，一爲被毁區域的重建，一爲集體市區的擴展，第二方案——體市區的擴展的實施，並無任何困難，在擬擴充的範圍內，除與農業有關的建築外，其他一槪不予修建。</p>
<p>三個工業區的建設，斐特主張先建第二區，——贛江東岸——建築伸入堤內的河道水閘，以及南部的側港，他的建議的理由，是認爲工廠的建立，皆以適宜的地基而定，假若任它自行發展，工廠方面所選擇的廠基，或不致在該區之內，如擬建工業區，能供給較多的便利，於相當時期後，定能成爲工業中心，再工業與工業之間，於相互招徠的關聯性，當爲人所共知。</p>
<p>被毁區域重建方案的實施，困難自多，非採取斷然手段不爲功，斐特認爲土地的重劃，乃係照方案重建，即被毁區域土地的發展之唯一有效方法，設土地不能重劃，則各業的合作勢屬必要，否則，不但引起不能終止的談判，結果使方案十分之九因而不能施行，充其量僅能獲得一折中辦法而已，這個方案的實施，並不須市府另撥新地，充作補償，設舊有機塲爲公有補償，設舊有機塲爲公有地產，將其分成適宜小塊，用以可補償被中央公園征用土地的業主，公園的土地，亦可劃爲小塊，充作同樣用途。</p>
<p>新建設的第二個問題，爲房屋的建造，應該處區別永久與臨時房屋，臨時房屋的壽命，遠較佔計的保衛年限爲長，此乃公認的事實，是項建築物的拆除，備極困難，在嚴重房荒的今朝，更不待言，斐特建議臨時房屋絕對禁建，在擬建永久房屋的地基上以及劃人中央公園範圍內的地基上，蓋公園方案的＼實施，決不能拆除逾　而仍可使用的房屋。他認爲臨時房屋，僅許建在預計爲火車站塲以及行政區的地基上，在決定實施是項計劃任何條件時，業主或住客將無充分理由反對拆除較緩計劃的實現。永久房屋的建設，當然以不違背新市區建設方案爲原則且建築設計等，必須經市府當局核准。</p>
<p>建設南昌示範市的方案，斐特依據工程推算，須廿年後始可全部完成，但是，以目前南昌地方的經費與人力，實不足負荷此一偉大工程的實施，市政當局現在決以最大的努力，從近處，細處着手，唐新市長，希望用自己的汗血，以促其成功。我們更盼望中央與社會人士，予以協助，針對着預期的目標邁進。</p>
<h3 id="c170">海安行 <a href="#c170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>— 十一月十五日海安訊　本報泰縣記者凌松籌</p>
<p>在東台沒有收復前，記者偷空到海安去了一趟。本來此次東行原定的目的地，便是海安；嗣因前方戰事進展迅速，記者乃一脚直到安豐，沒有在海安停下來。</p>
<p>到了海安鎭，最使你注意的，便是外圍那座土城。牠依着地勢的起伏，繞着整個海安。城的脚下，挖着戰壕，戰壕之外，蒺藜四布，情調是相當嚴肅的，上城東的大王廟，據說是蘇北有數的叢林，然而，佛力終擋不住火力，在這一次共軍圍攻中，全寺的房屋，都被摧毀了。山門外的兩隻石獅子，對立斜陽，使人平添無限感慨。照佛經上說：「一切有爲法，如夢幻泡影。」這也該是「解脫」了吧？</p>
<p>十九天的共軍圍攻，在物質上，海安受了難以統計的損失；而在精神方面，海安人，凡是經過這一次風波的，我想他畢生總該不會忘記。槍林彈雨，延長十九天之久，戰爭的恐怖，給予海安人的太深了！記者在海安三日內，差不多隨時隨地可以感觸得到</p>
<p>有人對我說：</p>
<p>「我親眼看到一個砲彈飛過來，嘩喇一聲，一所屋頂，便揭去了一半！」</p>
<p>有人對我說：</p>
<p>「一天傍晚，我到街上有事，忽然砰的一聲，一個砲彈落在我的右前方不到二十步遠。天哪，眞危險！假如那天我早一點出來，或是跑得快一些的話，我也許早就　進泥土中去了！」</p>
<p>還有人對我說：</p>
<p>「咳！那時候，我們也就昏昏地過去了。其實，那時誰是人誰是鬼，眞難說。因爲死的機會太多了！到了今天，我們才眞算是一個「人」！」</p>
<p>恐怖是恐怖，但那僅是一種回憶罷了。擺在面前的現實是——在國軍的保護下，火綫一天一天地越打越遠；而海安的市面也一天一天地繁榮起來。</p>
<p>街頭上攤販很多，有賣花旗橘子的，有賣玻璃皮帶的，差不多都是美國貨。生意挺好，比較普通店舖中的生意，反覺得活躍得多！一般收復區的市塲中，很多是這樣畸形地發展下去！</p>
<p>街道兩旁，零零碎碎地貼着許多紅紅綠綠的戰報，例如「國軍今晨×時收復富安」或是「我軍今晨×時進駐妥豐」之類。從道一件事上，反映出人民對國軍的推進是如何地興　和關切！</p>
<p>和這些戰報同造成一種戰時風味的，就是街上的碉堡，在一條熱鬧的街道中心，橫起一座碉堡，一眼望去好像路已斷絕了似的。可是在蘇北跑慣了的人們，便知道其中的底蘊。走到牠的面前，轉一個灣子，便「柳暗花明又一村」了。海安另外還有些碉堡，是兩面連着民房，中間丢一個門，給行人出入，外表和內部構造，簡直就是一座城門。想不到十六世紀的戰爭屛障物，到今天還會有用。</p>
<p>海安近數十年間，出了兩位書家。其一是韓國鈞，另一位就是譚組雲。韓國鈞字紫石，曾一度做過江蘇省長，對蘇北永利頗多貢獻。字宗平原參以北魏碑法，蒼渾可觀。聽說在敵僞盤踞時期，抑鬱以歿。今年春天，報載國府明令褒揚，舉行公祭，以張忠烈。譚組雲字德鍾。別署海陵老人。與韓爲兒女親家，字宗北魏，書譜寫得極熟，和譚故院長延　齊名，一時有南北二譚之號。現聞尙健在，海安就因爲有這兩位書家，所以字風特盛。一般商店的春聯，都摹倣他們兩位的體格，非韓之蒼渾，即譚之秀逸。當然，像不像是另一個問題，然而具體而微，亦足見文風所播，雖一二人亦足以轉移風氣，初不待宣傳提倡而始能收效也。</p>
<p>韓氏在海安，是很受人崇拜的，人們都稱他爲韓二太爺。現在他女公子柳嫻女士，就是鎭商會會長，以韓之文采流風，自足以蔭被百世。韓氏的寓邸在東門，相當典雅。駐防該鎭之六十五師師部就設在裏面。記者曾進去一下訪問該師師長李振將軍。</p>
<p>李師長住的房間，我疑惑就是韓氏的臥室，因爲壁上掛蕭一張韓氏的遺像。</p>
<p>屋子是中式的，滿屋陳設着各機關國體獻給師長的錦旗。上面題着：「東南屛障」，「爲國干城」等。屋旁有一座小花園，園內還有些亭榭之類。</p>
<p>記者去時，師長正批閱着文件。過了一會兒，起身招呼。我們便開始了一個五分鐘的談話。</p>
<p>師長是粤東人，年紀有五十歲的樣子。說話不全是廣東話，所以還可以聽得懂。</p>
<p>記者有先問師長，被共軍重圍十九天的經過。</p>
<p>師長說：</p>
<p>「詳細情形，一時也說不淸楚。總之共軍使用兵力達二十餘團，而我們僅有一個旅，外援盡絕；所好老百姓齊心協力，給予我們不少的帮助。」</p>
<p>繼着師長又吿訴記者一點六十五師的簡史：</p>
<p>「本師在廣東成立，士兵以兩廣藉爲最多，北方人很少。起先在沿海担任防務，其後轉戰於湖南江西一帶。今年春夏間由浙江轉調蘇州，而後由靖江來到蘇北。」</p>
<p>記者又以蘇北局勢相詢，請他發表一點意見。他很客氣地說：</p>

<h3 id="c171">閒話桂林市塲 <a href="#c171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>— 十一月十八日航訊　本報桂林記者梁小中</p>
<p>從大門外看一個紛擾不可終日的人家，多少總覺得有點神秘和興趣，同樣站在一個陌生的角度裏，替桂林的「算盤世家」描畫一個輪廓，也會莫測高深。</p>
<p>桂林自有秦開郡，中歷滄桑，凡數千年，始終都是一個政治氣味濃厚的都城商人的起家，最多也不過是一個小圈子的事情，起不了甚麽大作用。然而生意總是生意，到今天老百姓會賺錢，做官的也仰慕陶朱高風，大出做手，於長乎不覺使人有點「上下交征」的感慨。</p>
<p>四大城市之一　另有乾坤</p>
<p>爭利者於市，爭名者亦臨於市。由孳孳爲利想到岳武穆說的「文官不愛錢」，再想到廣西今日規模宏大的官僚資本集團的某貿易公司以至於運輸行，洋貨店，酒店，眞不禁對商人起敬。話是那麼說，然而以「商塲繁榮市面，」總離不了這一個都市的原則。今日桂林逐漸走回一層表面的繁榮，誰能够不感謝商人以及亦官亦商者的功勞！</p>
<p>桂林是廣西四大城市之一，交易貿遷遠比不上梧州柳州南寗的繁盛，甚至比不上貴縣（一個藉交通要津面暴發的小城，）然而北接三湘，倚帶　水南北有公路之便，湘桂黔動脈通放可待，京滬空運旦發夕至，因此也未始不有另一乾坤。雖然塲面冷落回首兩年前的商費如雲之盛，不足比擬但生氣仍如火後春草，一有機曾，總是老闆的世界。桂林本身並無特產，只是一個轉運過手的樞紐，就中活躍於市中的貨物，並不多見，有者當推百貨店中的「美國裝備」以及來去匆匆的桐油和糖而已。</p>
<p>幫客兩大活路　桐油與糖</p>
<p>帮各的兩大活路：一個是桐油，一個是糖，前者的做家眼睛望落廣州香港，後者的客人，耳朶聽到湖南漢口。從桂林分道揚鑣出貨，然後鈔票又從兩路歸合，多少人就這樣發了大財。桐油的出處，多半來自湖南（廣西十多年前，就連天　着植桐植到今天，還是年年喊種樹，年年不見樹，）碰好運氣一轉手總有兩三點苗顯，連日去勢看好，聲價十倍，一週間上揚二萬元（九萬漲到十一萬）仍見堅挺，油客嘴巴笑到合不攏來。糖爲大河一帶盛產，經汽車或　江溯運桂林轉道衡陽出沒粵漢北段一帶，市道有進無退，湘客納胃極強，來一擔收一擔，上好貢尖打到十七萬大關。片糖亦過八萬，整個市塲惟此二物最爲嬌貴，此外湘紙南運，亦見利路，惟以下江紙帮冲塲銷道不佳。汽油火油做家亦多，可惜好景不常，起跌過急，白汽油一瀉兩萬，目今尙徘徊十六萬左右，至於其他雜貨交易，規模微末，又不足以道了。</p>
<p>柴米油鹽等物　風波迭起</p>
<p>說到開門七事中的柴米油鹽半年來眞是風波洶湧蕩人心魄，就中又以米市嚇太最甚·桂林除了以辣椒著稱以外可謂一無所有。米源大抵仰給於桂北各縣以及湘米南來，去年災害空前，湘省至桂北顆粒無收，逢引起桂林無比的恐慌，米珠商喊入萬一擔，直到今造收成然後步步下趨，跌過二萬，只要來源偶疏即報價俏，操縱囤積者，有商有官，說來又堪一嘆，目前以五月無雨，下造早虫交迫，荒象又成，價錢已回迫三萬左右，且有看起之勢，人心惶恐，不可終日。至於木柴生油，亦有如桂枝玉液，生油每擔十一萬五，柴都要四千塊錢兩把，鹽市冷落，問津者少，雪生鹽三萬即可過手。</p>
<p>仰承上海鼻息　洋貨吃香</p>
<p>帮貨如此，市面如何？桂林的商店仰承海風到今天已是無「美」不備，有「美」皆臻，舉凡畫有「USA」的標　，就是番薯或蘿蔔，恐怕也不愁滯銷。一件玻璃雨衣七萬元，搶着要；一隻玻璃手提袋四萬五，搶着要；下至美國的The　Women's　friend（月經帶）都莫不利市百倍。洋貨吃香，布紗亦見神氣，美國的絲光卡機七千元一尺不說，湖南白土布也賣得挺硬，湘紗喊價三萬五，紗布大批從上海廣州冲入，依舊求過於供，廿枝難馬紗近三百萬高峯，最行時的士林布十六萬成交，紗布塲熱烘烘，表面看去，彷彿人們的購買力極强，其實歸根結底還不是三四年的破衣裳要換一換，旺月一過，恐怕也就落索凄凉了。</p>
<p>興波作浪搗蛋光鋒的金市，自外匯調整一漲八萬，躋到廿七萬後，以迄於今，依舊是　伏未動，使不得勁，桂林的金店近卅家，大部勢力握在「江西老表」的手裏，做好做歹，都是他們，面今門庭冷落，每日成交合起不過十兩八兩，老板躺在　面瞌睡過日。然而一錢飾金便有三千元撈頭。</p>
<p>三五千萬貨物　患積滯病</p>
<p>綜觀桂林的市塲，是蕭條裏的熱鬧，熱鬧裏的蕭條。除了官家世界外，也不見誰摸着了甚麼好走的大路。三五千萬的貨物，便要患上消化不良的積滯病，偶然　彩脫手，利頭削去稅項和關節，倒也有點濕潤，碰着霉月，便要立刻關門。這裏很少有商人得到銀行的好處，除非人事足，底子厚的，又當別論，月來正是旺市時候，商人們匆匆地來，匆匆地去，買進賣出，商店優待顧客，大吹大擂，倒也平添幾分熱鬧，只是二更過後，都又早已家家掩門，處處閉戶，獨餘青燈，靜靜的照着荒凉的馬路，靜靜的照着路上躑躅的災民，誰說商人眞能够把桂林帶出嚴冬的哀愁？</p>
<h3 id="c172">寗茶的厄運 <a href="#c172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>— 十九日寗訊　本報南昌記者劉藻</p>
<p>贛西北角的武寗，地勢多山，稻田缺少，是江西的一塊大茶園，山地裏人民生活的主要經濟源泉，戰前每年紅茶產量的最高量，有一萬箱，運到上海轉售英美德蘇的茶行。</p>
<p>武寗茶區的產品，上海統稱之爲「寗茶」，過去八年來的慘遭敵人的蹂躪，茶樹被破伐充作柴料，一片荒凉，茶農亦爲了生活　茶銷被阻，祇好使得大塊園地荒蕪，改業，今年的產量　降，不及戰前的十分之一，現有八百五十箱新茶，運到上海，一直到今日，仍然存放在貨棧裏，無人問津，假若今年的茶銷，再受打擊，則寗茶的前途，定會走上崩潰的厄運。</p>
<p>一般熟悉茶業內情者談，茶農的生活，是更苦於平地的田農，他們受着經濟的壓力與茶商的剝削，終年的辛勞，難謀一飽，現在武寗茶聯社的收價，大的是紅茶每斤三百元，綠茶四百元。茶聯社收買之後，加工製造，每斤的成本，化上將近二千元，假若以目前上海的茶市行情，一担紅茶的成本，要廿萬元，售出的最高價，祇能爬上廿五萬的大關，存放在上海的八百五十萬箱寗茶：由於成本的過鉅，與市價低落，迄今無人問津，但是，寗茶遭遇這種厄運，一方面是由於成本過高，另一方面是由於溫州茶的拋出與台灣茶的傾銷。</p>

<h3 id="c173">夫婦間 <a href="#c173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>— 渡雲</p>
<p>我國舊禮敎，夫婦之結合，往往由於父母之命，媒妁之言，雖不免有所謂怨耦，但能和衷共濟，白首到老的也很不少。現在夫婦之結合，往往由於自由戀愛方式，其間能保持美滿的固多，而易於反目，相互仳離的，似乎成了家常便飯。這般看來，夫婦相處之道，眞不容易。前者之能長保，多少有些道德觀念；後者之乍離乍合，實在是自私性作祟。夫婦居人倫之百，理應鄭重，但求長保夫婦間之情感，應注意幾點：</p>
<p>一、　　　體就是互相體貼，妻子要體貼丈夫；知道丈夫在外工作，不論勞心或勞力，一樣是勞動，公畢回家，自然疲乏不堪，妻子應使他得有休息機會，使恢復他疲乏的精神，這樣使家庭成爲丈夫的樂園。切不可一見丈夫進門，似乎就加增了她的煩勞，不耐煩服侍，或絮絮叨叨，訴說雜務，這樣丈夫看家庭如地獄，對妻子愛情漸趨冷淡了。丈夫也要體貼妻子；應知道女人比男子軟弱，有可减輕要子對家務上的煩瑣，應盡力促其實現，所謂體貼入微，自能長保愉快。再說　就是諒解。夫婦之間，無所謂爭面子，應該互相諒解，丈夫對於妻子：或因其智識有所不足，或因其體力有所不及，往往發生見解之不同，應予解釋，使她了解；應以力之所及，帮助操作，使她得到休息，這樣在妻子心目中，自然是個好丈夫。而妻子對丈夫外面交際，朋友往來，能知道顧到丈夫的地位，尤其對家用之開支，量入爲出，不能對丈夫百般苛求，要道樣，要那樣，這般便能相處以久了</p>
<p>二，忠實　有些丈夫，以爲妻子無知女流，在外一切，都不使妻子知道；甚至連薪金收入多少，也保守秘密，這便是對妻子的不忠實。其結果妻子不知丈夫收入多少，不能預計開支，即此一端，猜疑其他方面，妻子與丈夫，中間起了隔膜，隔膜愈久，愛情冷淡，結果自然痛苦。妻子對於丈夫，不說眞實話，行動鬼祟，也自然引起丈夫的不愉快。總之，一個人行事要光明磊落，尤其夫婦間，如是相處日久，互見性情，愈久而恩愛彌篤，偕老白頭，自可預祝也。</p>

<p>婚姻不是一件局定的事，而是待你去做的事。——莫羅阿</p>
<p>在幸福的婚姻中，每個人應尊重對方的趣味與愛好。以爲兩個人可有同樣的思想，同樣的判斷，同樣的欲願，是最荒唐的念頭。——莫羅阿</p>
<p>婚姻是建築於一種本能之上的制度，且其成功的條件不獨要有肉體的吸引力，且也得要有意志，耐心，相互的接受及容忍。由此纔能形成美妙的堅固的情感，愛情，友誼，性感，尊敬等等的融和，唯有這方爲眞正的婚姻。——莫羅阿</p>

<p>朔風又起，氣候漸漸地寒冷起來，這時進補最爲相宜，所以一切補品，隨風而起，尤其在現在市上充滿着美國貨，維他命丸，肝精，拍勒托，以及各種補針等等，五花八門，雖然爲具有相當功效者，可是也有不少過乎宣傳的。</p>
<p>我國有一句俗語：「藥補不如食補」，實在相當有理，西洋也有「買補藥可向小菜塲去找」諺語，以前惡性貧血一症，並無特效藥，後經一個醫生偶然發見用鮮肝治愈患此病者，經過了多少的硏究把肝裏主要成份提出來製成肝精，以便服用或注射，現在一般藥廠都往小菜塲裏收購牛猪肝，因此本來爲平民食品的肝臟，馬上成爲貴族化的補品。</p>
<p>由此可知凡是有關營養的病症，都可以自某種食物中取得所需養料，來滋補身體，藥品不過站在輔助的地位而已。所以我們要進補，應該每餐多吃些滋養豐富的食品。</p>

<h3 id="c177">肥皂的優劣 <a href="#c177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>— 內金</p>
<p>肥皂可以說是家庭日常用品中最不可缺乏的一種；但一般家庭因肥皂之惡劣，往往無形中受了極大的損失，旣化高價，又無良果，所以這是很値得注意的。現在且把最簡便的而又最有效的肥皂優劣鑑別法寫下來，以供大家的試騐。</p>
<p>第一，把一小塊肥皂，溶於純粹酒精中，或加熱使其溶解，這樣，肥皂中所含的沙粒，澱粉，小石子等雜質，必不溶解而完全沉降於底部；如係優純的肥皂，則必能全部溶解，而無絲毫沉澱可言。</p>
<p>第二，普通的肥皂中，都含有未鹼化之脂肪，這是很不適用的，因其不易使洗滌品淸潔；可以肥皂之新切面塗於一張透明的玻璃紙上，微加　，於陽光下如見有透明的小點者，即未鹼化之脂肪也。</p>
<p>第三，較劣的肥皂中，均含有成游離狀之鹼質，這非但不　使洗滌品淸潔並且很易使洗滌者的手部皮膚感覺燥痛。可取肥皂少許，使溶解，（加入酒精或加熱。）然後滴入液狀昇汞（即HgC12）數滴，如有黄褐色之沉澱發生，即證明內中含有鹼質。亦可置於乾燥（或通風）的空氣中，如有白色針狀結晶發生者，即爲游離狀的鹼質太多之故。</p>
<p>第四，肥皂巾含脂肪過多，亦不佳；可置小片肥皂於稀硫酸（的3c.c）中，加熱後，靜待冷却，如見上部凝結之脂肪過多，亦不宜採用蓋洗滌時太浪費也。</p>

<p>— 含英</p>
<p>讀十一月十九日本欄鳳女士寫的一篇「後母心」之後，不禁觸動我身世之感。</p>
<p>我的母親，在我剛四歲的時候，就畏逝了。過了一年多的光景，我又有了「新媽媽」。因爲聽人說「新媽媽」要打人，所以不敢去親近她，但爲　好奇，又悄悄地倚在牀頭，遠遠瞧她梳頭。新媽媽沒理會，統好頭，就出房去了，這是後母進門第二天的情景。那時對這「新媽媽」的印象是：也許她不會打我，但也不覺得她愛我，以後常聽到她和父親爭吵的聲音，於是就覺得新媽媽可怕。</p>
<p>記得是過年的時候，我們姊弟四人到舅家去，因爲有表姐表哥作伴，舅舅喜歡逗我們玩，舅母又時刻關照我們的衣食，眞覺快活。玩了幾天，家裏來人接我們回去，小孩子知道什麼呢，那裏好玩就想在那裏玩個痛快，於是趕忙藏起來，慫恿舅母把來接的人退回去，以後又接了兩三一，才傷心地回家。奇怪的是：回去了，媽不但不問我們在舅舅家裏如何玩，好不好玩之類，待我們去招呼她，她立刻把臉一沉，背轉身走開了，一連幾天都如此，我們也莫明其妙，經家裏的人提醒：媽媽在生氣了。怎機才使得媽媽歡喜呢？據說要向她賠禮，（就是道歉，她示意照護我的老女傭，要我們這樣做）。結果把我們帶到她面前去磕頭，她才復了原。自此以後，凡是禮貌不週，她就來這麼一套無言之敎，直到磕頭認錯爲止。以後我們更喜歡到舅母家去，一去總不想回來，每决回家，都是舅母連哄帶勸才成，我還怪舅母我們玩得正快樂爲什麼要我們回去。那時看見表哥在舅母面前撒嬌撒痴，一面驚佩他的大膽，一面就希望自己也有這樣一個容許我撒嬌的媽媽，可是一到家裏，就一切膽量都沒有了。父親呢，覺得他是愛我們的，但他對我，除了爲我買書籍玩具而外，總是本少言寡笑，一派莊嚴，縱有什麽意見，也不敢對他發表，更兼他三年之中，總有兩年不在家，我除了看後母的臉色而外，一切活動都是和老僕人一起。我的後母有時也有好顏色，那就是有客人來的時候，尤其是當着我們舅父舅母面前：「×舅母，我自來就怕人說待不得前房兒女，這幾個娃娃，我從來沒有打過他們一下，你問間他們，看我究竟打過他們沒有？」的確，她沒有打過我們，可是我們覺得比打還可怕。我們就在這種敎育之下，兢兢業業地長大起來。自然我們和她生的小弟弟的待遇，是逈然不同的，我也不必再說了。</p>
<p>我一向以爲：「後母心，三寸釘，有多長，釘多深。」一聽到有人續弦，我德暗暗替他的前妻子女担心，讀到這篇文章，我纔覺得自己過慮了，我想這該是敎育問題，我們上一代的婦女，受過敎育的很少，因爲傳統上有後母虐待前妻子女的老例，孩子們，對於後母不免有點怕，但他仍十相和「母親」親近的，只是不敢而已，在這樣狀態之下，不明理的後母，就認爲孩子們不親近她，就如到舅家去玩，不想回家，那也是出於自然的事，在後母心中，便疑心是舅母在敎唆，在離間。加以自己有了孩子，更因爲骨肉的關係，不免厚此薄彼，於是和前妻的子女，愈來愈隔膜，甚至眞正對立起來，造成若千的不幸事件。　我以我記憶所及，幼年時代對後母確是毫無反感，而且把後母眞當自己母親看待，只要討得母親歡喜，磕頭賠禮都肯，在我後母心裏快活，閑來無事時，常以愛不愛來逗我，她說「我不愛你」，我立刻就哭起來，她再說一句「我愛你」，我會立刻破涕爲笑，在她也許以騙這傻孩子開心，可是在我小心眼中，却以爲眞是這麽一回事的。</p>
<p>看到鳳女士寫她的孩子——明，那種趦趄不前的情形，聯想到我見後母時的情景，完全一樣，那是是想和新媽媽親近，但是又怕，如果做後母的了解孩子這一點心理，立刻就把握住他，我相信你會覺得他會比自己親生孩子更可愛。因爲他有一點自卑心，惟恐你不愛他，所以最肯接受你的敎訓。</p>
<p>我已是三十左右的人了，現在婦女受過敎育的漸多，下一代的孩子，有後母的，也許都能像鳳女士的「明」，那眞値得慶幸的事了。</p>

<h3 id="c179">藝術品的複製問題 <a href="#c179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>— 施翀鵬</p>
<p>中國藝術品的成就，較世界任何國家爲早，武梁祠石刻，雲岡石窟，燉煌壁畫，以及隋唐塑像，宋元繪畫等名蹟，偉大精微，世無其匹。惟千餘年來，中國藝術在技術上毫無進步，不但毫無進步，甚至古法蕩然，有滅絕失傳的危機。因此，過去的藝術名蹟，無法保存，未來的藝術作品，無法產生，向以藝術見長的中國民族，不斷地倒退，將成爲一無所長的低能民族的國家。</p>
<p>藝術文化如此倒退，原因當然不止一端，而政府不能提倡，人民缺乏研究藝術的工具，實爲最大的癥結。任何藝術品，欲求其進步，必先把已成的藝術品，加以研究揣摩，然後，別出心裁，精益求精。譬如繪畫，除了兒童時代，應該順應他美的創造本能，讓他自由發表以外，其他專門研究藝術的，必從著名的繪畫眞蹟，加以臨摹和參攷。（中國繪畫和西洋繪畫學習技法根本不同，）硏究牠筆法墨法，以及章法結構，然後才可變化創造；又如學習彫塑，必先參攷著名的彫塑品，硏究牠刀法彫法，以及姿態神情，然後學習，不難着手。所以已成的著名藝術品、實爲學習藝術的良好工具，在我們貧乏的國家，幅員如此廣大，交通如此不便，縱有絕頂天才的藝術家，也沒有客觀的條件，可以養成他，造就他，除非他生長在貴族家庭，（中國有「堂上無古畫，不是舊人家」的成語。）書畫古董，庋藏豐富，可以隨時研究，否則，一般寒酸的子弟，攻讀之餘，要學習一藝的，只好利用些木刻的芥子園畫譜之類的東西，來臨摹參攷。此外，便無從得見歷代古績？連四王吳惲的作品，也不容易看到。</p>
<p>在歐美各國的大都市，都有藝術館，博物館的設置，藝術敎育機構，亦非常之多，愛好藝術者，可以任意去參觀臨摹，獎勵任何人把藝術品去複製，更因印刷術的精良，把一切藝術品攝影製版，普遍發行，任何窮鄕僻壞，都可以傳播推廣。於是所有的藝術工作者，對於藝術參放品，俯拾皆是。四顧我國，過去專制時代深藏固閉，民國以還，雖然成立了故宮博物院之類機構，最近數十年，雖然也有銅版玻璃版的藝術印本，可是成效極爲微小，而且拘束甚多，對於藝術品的複製，視爲專利品。私人收藏的藝術品勿必說，便是政府的故宮博物院，對於院內的藝術品，也是禁例森嚴，作者在十年前，參加倫敦中國藝展上海預展之後，把繪畫部份的觀摩筆記，整理成爲「中國名畫觀摩記」一書，交商務出版，採用了幾張繪畫插圖，於是引起故宮博物院嚴重的注意，大有翻印了他們秘笈的嫌疑，後來，經過行政院參事滕若渠說明之後，方告了事。故宮博物院對於藝術品的流傳，竟抱如此的見解。</p>
<p>最近大公報載，北平故宮博物院古畫一百幅，在成都舉行展覽，特別鄭重地宣吿：「展覽期中禁止拍照與臨摹」。這是什麼理由？國家收藏的古畫，爲什麽不准國人的「拍照與臨摹」？拍照與臨摹，無非是闡揚國粹與研究藝術；歐美的美術館，都是公開展覽任人臨摹的，爲什麽我們故宮博物院對此攝影和臨摹，懸爲禁例？試問這數百年以至千餘年的古畫，倘不公開任人臨摹，從事複製，那末，再數百年以至千餘年以後，故宮博物院用什麽科學方法永久保藏下去？担保牠不致自然毁滅？目前，中國藝術已經在不進則退的危急狀態之下，非由政府提倡獎勵，實在無法復興，無法保存過去的藝術水準。應該把歷史上有價値的藝術品，儘量加以複製，鼓勵藝術工作者儘量臨摹，然後，這些有價値的藝術品可以傳播久遠，傳播到全國，全世界，中國藝術才不致滅絕，不致失傳！我想從事藝術文化的同人，對此藝術品的複製問題，該有同樣的希望吧！</p>

<p>— 王醒吾</p>
<p>讀「抗戰八年木刻選集」後</p>
<p>藝術雖是人類創造出來的，可是不能離開現實，超過歷史。藝術是由歷史累積而成的，是由現實演化出來的。</p>
<p>如果藝術是超脫現實的東西，那末藝術之對人生，太玄虛，太無意義了。烏英克爾夢說：「——術和自然是混在一起的，他是一種純粹客觀的事實。」赫格爾也說：「藝術是事物所現出的永恒的理性，它的特質是『無限』和「自由」。」可見「眞善美」的藝術，是普遍於人間，瀰漫於六合的。</p>
<p>藝術是無法離開自然，脫離人生的。這已成爲千載不易的定理。但是自然和人生，如果不經過藝術的攝取，綜合與發揚，把他歸納到有系統的文獻上來，那麼社會的諸形相與自然美的諸要素，永遠不能佔有空間而作時間的流傳，而對人類有所影響了。</p>
<p>我國版畫藝術，是有着相當的歷史，可以說在石器時代已經發軔了。那時候所留下來的遺物巾，有好多都是用刀刻成的，工具和製作方法都和現在的木刻相仿。河北周口店，發掘出來的很多石片，雕刻非常精緻，內容都係原始生活的紀事。自從印刷術發明之後，中國的版畫，成績更是輝煌了。例如：古籍，裨史，佛經，道藏，小說，種種的刊本，都有着插畫。民間也有着各色各樣的風俗刻畫。這些有歷史童義的藝術成績，中間雖然有起落與盛囊的演變，可是我們始終未曾把這種寳貴的事業，擱滯於一個停止的階段。目前版畫藝術的興起，固然是受國外作品的影響，可是我們民族的藝術文獻，自有他優厚的根基。</p>
<p>人類社會不能沒有藝術，好像魚不能沒有水藻一樣。藝術愈進步，人類的生活愈文明，進步也愈快速。所以近十幾年來木刻事業應運而生。</p>
<p>十五年前我國的木刻，還落在「技匠」的手裏他們爲嫁粧刻裝飾品，爲門牆屋宇刻點級品。因而不能登入大雅之堂。魯迅先生看到這一點竟爲木刻界開闢了一條新的路，樹起了新興木刻運動的旗幟，充實了木刻出版界，擴大了木刻事業，使木刻事業發生了藝術的作用，因而改造了社會上對於木刻藝術的觀點。「抗戰八年木刻選集」，是由抗戰八年木刻展覽會內，所陳列的數千種作品中，精選出來的。全集共百幅，是七十五位作家的作品。是他們以多年的經騐與修養，用各種各樣的刀法與線條刻成功的。這些作家們曾在全國各地組織藝術團體，推進木刻運動，如木鈴社，一八藝社，春地畫社，野風畫社，上海繪畫硏究社，中國版畫研究社，平津木刻會，太原木刻硏究社，現代版畫會，開封木刻硏究會，南京木刻會，濤空畫會，鐵馬版畫會，野穗社，深刻木刻研究會，中華全國不刻協會等。不僅如此，他們並且像老農一樣，不斷地耕耘，不斷的努力積累起無數的作品傳流於各處，不論都市和鄕村。抗戰期間，他們的作品曾在北平，天津，太原，濟南，上海，漢口，重慶，桂林，杭州，南京，潮州，廣州等處，舉行過展覽，都有着他們優良的成續。便是國外，也有他們的傑作流傳。例如：一九三六年匈牙利世界木刻展覽會，一九三七年美國芝加哥藝術學院舉辦之世界木刻展覽會，他們均有作品寄去參加。一九三九年之後，他們迭將不刻選送英，美。蘇及印度等國去展覽。使新興的中國木刻藝術在莫斯科，列寗格勒，倫敦，紐約和加爾各答等處出現。博得世界各國的好評。至於他們十幾年來的書刊，比較具有歷史價値的，有現代版畫，木刻界，木刻紀程，木藝，木刻，藝術等數十種。</p>
<p>藝術可以使人的心理機能充躍着和諧的活動，雖不實用，却會啓蒙人類向上和進取。新興的木刻運動　它就具有這種使命。</p>
<p>由於先進的啓導，再經過十幾年來無數的木刻家的不斷努力，我國的木刻事業，繼往開來，已經步上復興的大道。「抗戰八年木刻選集」正是他們多年苦鬥的結晶，他們像戰士一樣，帶着一副木刻武器，由農村到城市，由戰區到後方，由國內到海外，肩負着木刻復興的使命。由於他們的努力，使祖國在藝術上有更大的光榮。</p>

<p>— 楊謀</p>
<p>把舵者</p>
<p>你別太重視了那些巨大的艨艟，它們的主宰却只是把舵者的全副精神；你也是渺視了那些靜靜的河流中的小艇，它們也正有着一個把舵者在孜孜的工作。</p>
<p>狂風，巨浪，黑暗，孤寂，衝破它，擊破它，……</p>
<p>偉大的把舵者。——他的生命被寄託着千萬人的生命，他的精神也正爲着千萬人熬煎。他終極的目標是正直的，但是他要在那些海礁阻障中去開闢一條迂迴曲折的路。面部的表情也許是嚴肅的，許是雋逸輕鬆的，但是他的心却正在尋覓一條沒有路標的道路。</p>
<p>這是一件平凡的工作麽？是呀，當那船舶劃破那一平如鏡的水波，悠然前進的時候，又有誰能體味這隱在的水力和礁島。風奔，浪騰，船顚簸了，換來了咒駡和譏諷，更有誰想到那把舵者正拚着性命在搏鬥。</p>
<p>人們都只想着一個「自己」，除了「自己」以外，又有誰肯多想一想呢？</p>
<p>於是，把舵者的苦心，永遠只是孤寂的了。</p>
<p>孤寂</p>
<p>有時，我常會戞然的感到孤寂。</p>
<p>整個世界和歡笑都好像離我而去，只有我自己的心房在撞擊着回憶的門。</p>
<p>傾瀉而出的，是酸，是甜，是辣，……</p>
<p>我怕孤寂，我也怕回憶。</p>
<p>在人羣中，我不曾自餒，我不曾示弱，我也不曾怕過。我會把牙關咬緊，我會從磨難中學習。但是，常空閑進逼我的時候，我想起了，一切的勞碌都是徒然，世界只是少數人的庭園，有又誰能無動於衷呢？</p>
<p>生命還只是這麼的年靑，誰願意受孤寂的熬鋉？我喜歡和諧，我想縱聲的歡樂，環境如斯，卻終不免讓孤寂溜進了生活的一角。</p>
<p>如何去驅逐呢？却終又不免使我彷徨了。</p>

<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>一那麼，剛才這獨眼龍先生，强迫我們上車時，你爲什麼不指他一指？」鶴見跟萍子開玩笑了。</p>
<p>萍子收到這個電訊，忙把玉手一縮，飄了鶴見一眼，把一張標準型的小嘴，又撅了起來。鶴見微微一笑，把她縮回去的那隻素手，又扯了過來放在自己手掌上。</p>
<p>「不許再開玩笑了」，萍子的手指，重新敲着發電秘碼，「我剛人門不久，哪裏有這本領？」</p>
<p>「老人作什麽來？」鶴見發出問電。</p>
<p>「來救我們的。」萍子現出得意的笑容；「我很耽心你的健康，替你算算，共有五十多小時，沒有正式休息了！精神固然仍舊壯旺，但也不能這樣消耗……！」</p>
<p>「謝謝你關念……我也學過「玄術」，可以永遠不睡眠，只需每一，二小時，靜養十分鐘。」</p>
<p>「眞的嗎？……從誰學的？」</p>
<p>一千眞萬確，你瞧我現在不是仍舊很新鮮嗎？……這是我的支那密友岳君傳授的，他是支那文學家，同時他也是密宗，　以　　　劍氣擊人。空手虛虛一推。可把百米以外的人擊倒，甚至擊死。他的師父還要厲害，可以百里以內，憑空取人首級，他的師祖更要厲害，……」電訊斷了；因老人和那獨眼先生，已經談完了話，從對街踱了過來。</p>
<p>「萍兒，下車來罷」，老人開了車門，對萍子點着頭，「鶴見君還得去去！」</p>
<p>萍子本來緊緊握住鶴見的手，不肯放下，但見老人，抬手一招，那萍子好像受了很大的一股力量，一拖似的，不由得身體一震，立刻放鬆了手，僂身下了車。老人這時，仍舊把住車門，讓開萍子，又抬起一隻手來，好像遙遙撫着鶴見的前額似的，輕輕按了一按：</p>
<p>「哈哈，拿摩波羅唵迷吽……！」老人放開蒼老的聲音，這們唸着。</p>
<p>鶴見坐在車角，經這一按一唸，神志忽地一迷，像要暈去一樣，但一霎眼之間，覺得丹田陡然充滿了一股熱氣，這熱氣，由下面上，由裘而外，一剎散佈全身，眞像完全休息了一夜那樣，精神體力，陡然健旺起來；並且好像憑空添注了一種潛力，把這兩天經過的勞碌，忍受的痛苦，　　　　上的一切煩惱，恐懼·焦慮·都化爲烏有，頓覺前途都是光明。</p>
<p>（科學到了這二十世紀末，總算進了昌明的初步，這裏還有這些迷信的怪離亂神，鬼話連天，恐怕大衆見了，要說這段記載，成了封神榜，西游記類的神話了。殊不知這點手法，正是科學巾的「應用心理」一門，一種小小作用；那種做作唸師，不過一種傳達精神的手段；用自己修養過的精神，傳遞過去，把對方猛然喝醒，發動對方的潛在精神；好像那川竭了的電池，重又過上新電似的。這也好比困頓疲敝的軍隊，一旦聽得長官報吿，生力援軍已到，有了接濟，一般也能精神陡長，奮力衝鋒陷陣起來。又好比近代醫生，有的施行手術，竟能不用全部或局部麻醉，只須一度催眠，病人即可不覺痛苦，這催眠術就是「應川心理」中的一個方式。其他如印人及黄敎的吞刀，履火，等等，看去好像魔術，其實也是一種自己催眠方法，發動本身的潛在精神和能力，並不希奇。）</p>
<p>鶴見精神振作，心下十分安定，瞧着老人把萍子帶走之後，在車中也不同那位獨眼紳士談話，也不問他到什麼地方去；只知道車子行了的莫二十九分鐘，轉過好幾條街道，便曳然停止。這時鶴見心下，只想着萍子可囑的話—「小心烟匣」—只願有個機會，看看烟匣裏，萍子究竟放下了什麽東西。</p>

<p>據同仁輔元堂統計，從上月二十七日至二十九日，三天內收殮路屍的數字共爲三百十六具，其中成人路屍四十六具，未成年的孩屍二百七十具，在大上海四百五十萬人口中，五萬人中幾達三人，這個比例不能說不够使人驚駭的了。</p>
<p>而氣象局的預測，今年冬季溫度可能降至攝氏冰點下十度，將達過去本埠最寒冷的紀錄（民國十六年十二月），這是一個可怖的報吿。</p>

<p>關於聯合國的常識　譯自英文字林西報</p>
<p>問：如果有一個國家拒絕接受理事會的決議，或拒絕由和平途徑解決糾爭則又如何？假定和平受到威脅，有一個國家發動侵略則又如何？</p>
<p>答：這時安全理事會可以令各會員國對侵略國斷絕全部或一部經濟關係，並斷絕交通及外交問：各會員國一定要遵從嗎　答：是的。因爲牠們都曾同意履行安全理事會的決議。</p>
<p>問：理事會的權力就盡於此嗎？</p>
<p>答：不。如果理事會認爲上述方法仍然不够，牠可以「捉用陸海空武力以維持和平」。</p>
<p>問：有立刻可以使甩的武力嗎？</p>
<p>答：有的。訂有這種義務的國家應該準備好隨時給理事會使用的空軍。牠們同時還要通知理事會，牠們預備供給的其他海陸空軍力。</p>
<p>問：這些武力是否成爲國際的武力？</p>
<p>答：不。作戰計劃由理事會及其軍事參謀團所議定。除非有特約，這些一計劃之實行，是由各該國軍力在該國將領指揮之下完成的。</p>
<p>問：安全理事會包括那些國家？　答：包括中·美·英·法·蘇五强和六個由大會選出而任期兩年的國家。</p>
<p>問：是不是五强之中任何一個强國，都可以阻止安全理事會討論任何小國提出來的問題？</p>
<p>答：不。安全理事會要採取任何決議，必須五強的意見完全一致。這是因爲在必要時，是由五強負責推行理事會的決議。英國堅決主張五強的否決權不應防止理事會討論提出的問題。</p>
<p>問：如果在討論一問題中，五强中任何一個强國也被牽連在內，是否這强國在理事會中仍有表決權？</p>
<p>答：是的。理事會的會員對任何問題都有表決權——即使這是牽涉種們自己的問題。</p>
<p>問：託管制度是否使被管的國家永不獨立？</p>
<p>答：恰恰相反，憲章上寫明託管制度的主要目的之一就是協助受管國家成立自治政府或完全獨立。</p>
<p>問：憲章上說：各會員國應允合作解決國際經濟，社會，和文化問題，到底如何？</p>
<p>答：聯合國大會要選出十八個會員國以組織經濟及社會理事會，理事任期三年。</p>
<p>問：這理事會的任務如何？</p>
<p>答：牠的權力和義務是很有伸縮性的，因爲這是一個重大的試騐，歷史上從來未有過這樣的一個國際性的經濟委員會，因此牠的進展只能以經騐爲準。</p>
<p>問：牠到底幹的是什麽呢？</p>
<p>答：牠要調査所有的社會和經濟現象，並提出建議——例如敎育，勞工，衛生等項都在牠的任務範圍之內。</p>
<p>問：會員國有接受牠的建議的義務嗎？</p>
<p>答：不。這樣一來，變成了干涉他國的內政了。不過如果他建議而會員國不肯接受，則各處的與論都會知道的。（完）</p>

<p>關於配售羊毛毯的事，最近本埠各報都有言論發表。日昨本刊亦有文章提及，但該文說：「我們不願追究到底有無其事，其中經過如何……」我覺得我們要追究這件事，而且要立刻追究。因爲過去有許多的事都是由傳說成爲事實的，這使我們不能「不啓疑置」。如果最初沒有準備配售倒也罷了，旣然說要配售爲什麽忽又不配售了呢？先說祇有一萬條了，後說祇有二千條了，最後竟說不配了。到底羊毛毯子到那裏去了？他們變的什麽花樣？我們要追究，我們要澈底的追究！我們要通緝羊毛毯到案法辦！這幾天風那末大，天那末冷，窮苦的公敎人員，都伸長了頭頸盼望着這些毯子來禦寒呢！</p>

<p>停配羊毛毯的消息傳出後，公敎人員　深憤激，但物資供應局却毫不說明理由，竟然厚着臉皮地默認「中途變卦，高價出售。」這種坦白，固然少有，但總使人覺得：「面皮未免太厚」，眞如某商店廣吿所云：「現在世界大不同，第一讓證老面皮」。</p>
<p>更令人佩服的是：主管當局也同樣不聲不響，「當伊嘸介事」；說得俗氣些，對於這種「面孔不要」之流，夫復何言？</p>

<p>— 任凡</p>
<p>也許，你會奇怪，自從國民革命統一全國　定都南京後，似乎不大聽到張繼光生的消息吧！是的，他二十年米沒有做行政官，然面如果你覆按中華民國革命史乘，張先生在　國的歷史與功績，就願得不凡了。他常自稱：「我是十足的一個「暴徒」，」光緒三十年，這位「暴徒」就爲了萬福華刺王之春案，捉住在上海。二次革命，又被袁世凱指爲「附亂份子」下令通緝，亡命到日本去。其後民國分裂局面中，張先生又忙着爲國事奔走，穿了件褪舊的袍子，靑馬褂，戴帽頭，東去接洽，西去調停。誰都知道張溥老（張字溥泉）是個最　負責任的人</p>
<p>張薄老爲河北滄縣人，粗胖的身軀，孔武有力，脾氣異常直爽，政局方面有問題時，新聞記者只要能够找到他，他就無話不談，語必痛快淋漓。寇覬覦我國時，溥老是主張抗戰最激烈的一位。還記得民國廿五年在京召開的四中全會中，張先生當塲痛駁當時外交部的妥協外交政策，聲色俱厲，害得張部長面紅耳赤，大會結束，張群因此去職，面「暴徒」敢言之名，也就就盛傳了全國。</p>
<p>張先生是國文生平圾信任的同忐，他與林故主席，吳椎暉，張靜江共被稱爲「黨國四元老。「自奉儉約，守身如玉，所以雖然是黨國元老，還是一介書生兩袖淸風，不久前不是在報上看到「張繼　書」的廣吿嗎？——張先生的草書寫得挻秀勁</p>
<p>幹政治的人似乎免不了先跨入報界，張先生在光緒二十九年，就做過　報的參議，後來好像也辦過報，現在還担任着中國新聞專科學校的董事長哩！</p>

<p>殘飯得之非易</p>
<p>但包飯作爲求維持血本計，其供給的飯量幾乎不多不少，甚至使吃後全無餘剩。這使攔路的丐流，目送空桶過關，祗好枵腹呑淚。丐帮受此一番敎訓，知道不能專靠　力截留，於是便忍痛出錢，向飯司夥計送運動費。務使每餐放手多添些飯，使剩飯數額可觀，足供一飽。這筆孝敬費每月或每季給付，由該帮爺叔支給。店夥受賄之後，丐流方免挨餓之苦。至於搶飯的地段都有規定，不可隨便侵界而引起爭執。而且搶飯都由小鬼下手，外界丐流決無染指的餘地</p>
<p>釘路扒與趕猪</p>
<p>「釘路扒」是老弟兄丐帮所發明的乞討新法。眞是「祇此一家，並無分出。」此輩　躅街頭，發見一個又肥又白的體面人走過，便立意跟隨乞討。路人際此不免愷急起來，於是放開大步向前直走希圖走出丐流的追襲。但丐流却「釘」住不捨。個中人名爲「趕猪」。肥人爲「猪」，「猪」自動伙步走，而丐流追之，厥狀確有些兒像趕。其造句之惡　，確屬可惡至極！</p>
<p>在過去，那些號稱正派的丐帮，向來沒有追隨路人乞錢規矩。任何老牌丐帮都不屑爲此。但老弟兄素以維新派自居，不惜在上海開此惡例。使路人出行，隨時有被面目可憎的丐流襲來的麻煩，不給資又無法遣散。如果靑年男女交臂同行，尤爲丐流所認爲最理想的對象。因爲此來足以打擾喁喁的情話，如果因此而大開快步，又未免太覺狼狽。最聰明的辦法還是勉爲其難地給資遣散。可是如果給其他的流丐瞥見，仍舊將因「有例可援」而跟來，又非再度破鈔，不可了。</p>
<p>從事「釘路扒」的丐流，多屬年靑而沾染烟癖的。故雖入項可觀，但永遠是衣不蔽體，令人作嘔。對付此輩的唯一辦法，便是穿越街心或是快快轉灣走入另一條横路。他們也祗好自認晦氣了。因爲「釘路扒」原有固定的地段。又因弟兄衆多，不得不互相劃定路關。每人祗能在路之一旁乞討。例如甲在街南，乙在街北，丙在上午横路，丁在下午横路而戊己則在縱路。日夜班互相接替，各不相犯。此項點兵換將的工作，由各地段的爺叔劃定。每條馬路的肥瘦榮枯都各有不同，而扒得的錢，例須劃出一份孝敬那「坐領俸祿」的爺叔呢。</p>

<p>且話生男育女</p>
<p>據路透社廿八日電巴黎官方曾舉行民意測驗，其結果認爲每一家庭中能有三個小孩爲最理想。其他雖也有願有小孩六個以上或者根本不願有家庭者，但總是很少的。</p>
<p>法國婦女，尤其是巴黎婦女是向來不喜生孩子的，這次戰後，大概是因爲感到了「人荒」，所以極力在設法獎勵生育了。</p>
<p>但中國人是素來喜歡生育的，也是最善於生育的。一般的所謂娶妻或嫁人老實地說其目的便是爲了生育孩子。中國人所謂：「不孝有三，無後爲大，」便足以證明了他的目的。至於「養子防老」的話，也更足以證明中國人是把孩子當作財產的。</p>
<p>於是，孩子便越多越好。越多，便越足以表示自己的已經盡「孝」並且有財產。倘使自己的妻子連一個兒女也不生，做丈夫的那就可以堂而皇之的再娶小星。至於女人，那就祗好暗自怪自己不爭氣，或者便去打聽秘方或買現成的「婦科靈藥」吃，務使自己有孩子爲止。　這樣，中國的孩子是終於有了，而且很多。但他們是只知「生」的，生了以後究竟應當怎樣「養」，那他們就壓根兒也沒有研究過。至多，能讓他們在所謂「學校」裏識上幾個英文字母或者能寫一封家信，就够了。至於如何使孩子趨於完全的「人」化，他們是不管的。</p>
<p>中國的將來在這批孩子手裏於是危險了。所以我認爲，與其養這許多只讓他們生而吃而死的孩子，還不如現在姑且不要生。要生也用不著這許多。如果將來萬一感到「入荒」時，再像法國一樣由政府訂立獎勵生育法，也還不晚；那時，所養出來的孩子我想是可以「有所用」了。</p>
<p>孩子，不患少而患濫芋充數。</p>

<h3 id="e1">National Assembly Enters Constitutional Drafting Stage: Chairman Urges Delegates to Discuss Earnestly; Constitution Draft Review Committee to Convene Tomorrow <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 2nd] The Central Commemoration Week was held at 9:00 AM on Tuesday. Chairman Chiang personally attended and led the ceremony, delivering an address. The Chairman urged Kuomintang National Assembly delegates attending the Commemoration Week to maintain order in the meeting venue, abide by the rules of procedure, speak in order, and be mindful of the time allotted for speeches. Brevity and clarity are paramount, and democratic habits must be cultivated. The Father of the Nation's "Fundamentals of Democracy" must be studied with a calm mind, fostering a positive atmosphere in all meeting venues. The Chairman also stated that the National Assembly has now entered the constitutional drafting stage, and he encouraged all delegates to discuss matters earnestly, prioritizing the nation and the people, wholeheartedly implementing the Three Principles of the People, and achieving the goals of the revolution. The address lasted half an hour, after which the ceremony concluded.</p>
<p>[Further Telegram] National Assembly delegates have been registering since November 2nd. Today marks the completion of one month. Today, additional delegates registered: Zheng Tianshi and Wu Zaochi from the Democratic Socialist Party, Xi Jia Cuo and Dan Maoxin from the Social Democratic Party, Qi Quanxi from the Mongolian representatives, and Hu Tiehua, a regional representative. This brings the total number of registered delegates to 1,652.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 2nd] The National Assembly Presidium held its ninth meeting at 6:00 PM on the 2nd, resolving the following: (1) Regarding the case of various delegate-producing units recommending candidates to participate in the Constitution Draft Comprehensive Review Committee, it was resolved that each unit should elect candidates for the Presidium, convene representatives from each unit to determine their selection, and submit the list to the Presidium by 12:00 PM on December 3rd. (2) Regarding whether reporters can attend the Constitution Draft Review Committee meetings, it was resolved that they may attend. (3) The dates for the seventh general assembly were determined, and the chairpersons were nominated.

<h3 id="e2">National Assembly's Sixth Meeting: Pan Gongzhan, Zhang Zhiben, and Others Vigorously Criticize the Constitution Draft <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 2nd] The National Assembly held its sixth meeting on December 2nd, continuing the broad exchange of views on the constitution draft. The meeting commenced at 10:25 AM with the ringing of a bell. Deputy Secretary-General Lei reported that 1,615 delegates had registered, with 1,179 in attendance, meeting the legal quorum. Chairman Bai Chongxi then led the customary ceremony. After the reporting officer praised the minutes of the previous meeting, Chairman Bai announced the start of the constitution draft discussion, requesting delegates to maintain order in the meeting venue and speak in turn. Yang Youjiong and 13 other delegates then expressed their opinions, which are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Yang Youjiong, a delegate from Hunan, argued that direct democracy should include provisions for all four powers. Chapter Twelve, "Elections," in the constitution draft should be expanded to "Direct Democracy I," adding the three powers of recall, initiative, and referendum.</p>
<p>He Xinghan, a delegate from Hunan, advocated for the deletion of the first and second clauses of Article 26 regarding the Legislative and Supervisory Committee members being National Assembly delegates. Instead, he proposed adding vocational elections in addition to regional elections to clearly delineate the division of political and governing powers.</p>
<p>Yang Yifeng, a vocational representative from Henan, argued for establishing the capital in Beijing, citing four reasons: "(1) From a national defense perspective, our national defense will inevitably be in the north for decades to come. Distant attacks are less effective than close defense, and being close to the border allows for constant vigilance. (2) The Father of the Nation's teachings do not explicitly state that the capital should be in Nanjing. The initial desire for Yuan Shikai to go to Nanjing was a strategic move. (3) The distinct northern climate is beneficial to the physical and mental development of the people. (4) Whether to move the capital or not should not be a calculation of mere relocation costs. The construction of Nanjing and the desolation of Beijing must be taken into account."</p>
<p>Pan Gongzhan, a specially selected delegate, questioned five aspects of the constitution draft amendment: "(1) Regarding the nation's territory, can it be altered with just a few legislators raising their hands? (2) The people's political power needs protection and strength to safeguard civil rights and control the government. If this constitution draft is adopted, will we have any political power to exercise in our lifetimes? (3) Will directly administered municipalities have National Assembly delegates? Why isn't this stipulated in the constitution? (4) The powers of the central and local governments are enumerated. In case of disputes, Article 113 states that the Legislative Yuan will resolve them. Is the Legislative Yuan a central or local organ? Is it more reasonable to have one side enumerate and the other summarize? (5) The status of directly administered municipalities is decided by the Legislative Yuan. Is there a desire to establish directly administered municipalities, or is there an intention to obliterate them?"</p>
<p>Wang Yin, a delegate from Chahar, argued that political and governing powers should be clearly delineated to avoid friction between governing organs and reduce administrative effectiveness.</p>
<p>Chen Guyuan, a specially selected delegate, raised five technical contradictions in the constitution draft amendment: "(1) The date for constitutional implementation is stipulated to be determined by law, but according to Article 146, laws must be passed by the Legislative Yuan and promulgated by the President to be established. Without a President, who will announce the date for constitutional implementation? (2) Should the power to discipline civil servants under Article 85 and Article 103 belong to the judiciary or the Supervisory Yuan? The constitution should clearly define this. (3) The wording of Article 1 is cumbersome and unintelligible. 'Government of the people, by the people, for the people' is democracy. It is too repetitive. Why not simply state 'A democratic republic based on the Three Principles of the People'? (4) Regarding the powers of the Legislative Yuan, the Political Consultative Conference resolution only stated that it is 'equivalent' to the 'parliament' of general democratic countries, not that it 'is.' The constitution draft amendment exceeds this, obliterating the Five-Power Constitution and the division of powers. This is inappropriate."</p>
<p>Jian Boqun, a women's representative, stated: "(1) The National Assembly should have the opportunity to assist the President. (2) The Legislative Yuan has too much power. (3) The provisions in the Chapter on Basic National Policies are too general, hasty, and vague and should be clearly listed in separate chapters." She argued that the constitution should be rigid and all-encompassing.</p>
<p>Xiao Zheng, a specially selected delegate, stated that the constitutions of various countries in the 18th and 19th centuries focused on political aspects, while this century has begun to focus on economic aspects. The constitution draft amendment is insufficient to protect the people's livelihood. The national economic system should be supplemented and listed as a separate chapter. The land system should refer to the "May 5th" constitution draft and be stipulated in detail.</p>
<p>Ma Xuchang, a representative of the liberal professions, argued for more proactive provisions on the writ of habeas corpus. Zhou Fuchang, a representative from Kang District, stated that the central government organ is called the "National Assembly," and the provincial government organs should change "Provincial People's Representative Assembly" to "Provincial People's Assembly" to maintain consistency.</p>
<p>Yu Wangde, a specially selected delegate, stated that when the President of the Executive Yuan exercises his powers, he is constantly hampered by the Legislative Yuan, which runs contrary to the principle of "capable government."</p>
<p>By this point, it was 12:00 noon. Chairman Bai, responding to the request of the assembly, reported that the meeting would continue at 3:00 PM in the afternoon and then adjourned the meeting.</p>
<h3 id="e3">Afternoon Session Continues: Delegates Speak Enthusiastically <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 2nd] The National Assembly's sixth general assembly continued at 3:30 PM on the 2nd, with 1,107 delegates in attendance. Delegates continued to freely express their opinions. Yan Guofu, Sun Yichang, Liu Hengjing, Zou Bingwen, Lou Tongseng, He Shi, Chen Changheng, Chen Zifeng, Xie Chengping, Wen Shiyuan, and others successively delivered speeches. A 15-minute break was taken from 4:55 PM to 5:10 PM. The general assembly adjourned at 6:00 PM. The important opinions of the delegates are recorded below:</p>
<p>Yan Guofu: "(1) We should study the constitution draft submitted by the National Government to make it more progressive. (2) Regarding central and local autonomy, the central government includes the five Yuans, and local autonomy includes provinces, counties, and Mongolian-Tibetan areas. (3) The people have four powers, but the National Assembly delegates do not. The National Assembly should have provisions for exercising the four powers. (4) The President's term of office should be changed to four years, with the possibility of reelection."</p>
<p>Sun Yichang: Chapter Three of the constitution draft, "National Assembly Delegates," should add vocational groups and women's groups to participate in the election.</p>
<p>Liu Hengjing: A good constitution should ensure that it can realize good ideals on the one hand and adapt to reality on the other. I believe that political power should be able to control governing power, and constitutional government should be politics for all the people. The constitution draft should be amended in the following two aspects: "(1) The National Assembly should have the power to elect legislators and supervisors. (2) The rights of farmers, workers, and women should be specially protected."</p>
<p>Zou Bingwen: "(1) We should explore the principle of balance for ordinary farmers. (2) Constitutional implementation is not what we advocate, but after the meeting, a transitional measure should still be adopted."</p>
<p>He Shi: The basic spirit is democracy, and the composition should be strengthened. A system of checks and balances should be established between governing power and political power. In Chapter Three, the National Assembly has no political power other than electing the President, so the people cannot control the government.</p>
<p>Lou Tongseng: "(1) The National Government has made great contributions to leading the Northern Expedition and persevering in the War of Resistance, so the status of the National Government should be added to the constitution. The most fundamental aspect of the ideal of a world commonwealth lies in economic stability, which then provides the strength to realize the ideal of an omnipotent government. (2) The Executive Yuan being responsible to the Legislative Yuan can cause a crisis for the Executive Yuan at any time, leading to a crisis of political instability."</p>
<p>Chen Changheng: Constitutional drafting should be based on the four virtues of "impartiality," "righteousness," "sincerity," and "clarity" to create a good constitution. My opinions are as follows: Article One should be changed to "The Republic of China is a republic based on the Three Principles of the People." Article Two, "The sovereignty of the Republic of China belongs to the entire people," should be changed to "The entire nation." Chapter Three, "National Assembly Delegates," should add vocational representatives and women's representatives. Chapter Four, "Functions and Powers of the National Assembly," should add the power to recall legislators and supervisors. Chapters Eight and Nine should add a chapter on the central government. Chapter Seven, "Judicial Yuan," should add a vice president. Chapter Nine, "Supervisory Committee," has too many members. Chapter Eleven, "Provincial and County Systems," should add a Mongolian-Tibetan system. Chapter Fourteen, "Basic National Policies," should be divided into chapters.</p>
<p>Fang Qingru: The Chapter on Elections places restrictions on the age of electors and those being elected. I wonder if the provincial governor and mayor are also subject to these provisions.</p>
<p>Qian Changzuo: The Chapter on Basic National Policies, Economics, Education, and Diplomacy should be separated.</p>
<p>Guo Heng: The National Government completed the Northern Expedition and the War of Resistance and is a capable government, which should be stipulated in the constitution.</p>
<p>Li Jiangqiu: The capital should be established in Beijing.</p>
<p>Xie Chengping: Establish a vocational representative election system. Even conservative Britain and Japan have vocational representatives. Legislators are connected to all aspects of society. If elections are held by province, there should be at least one person, which can solve the people's livelihood needs and lay the foundation for strengthening economic democracy. Secondly, the Chapter on Basic National Policies should strengthen national education to realize the ideals of government of the people, by the people, for the people and achieve the ideals of the Premier.</p>
<p>Yi Tuyuan: Article One, "Government of the people, by the people, for the people," should be abolished and changed to "The Republic of China is a democratic republic based on the Three Principles of the People." Article Seven should confirm the establishment of the capital in Beijing. Articles Eleven to Fifteen, regarding provisions for autonomy, should state that "it shall not be restricted by law." Article 24, which confirms that in certain circumstances, it can "be protected by the constitution," is contradictory. We believe that relative freedom should be adopted. Articles Eleven to Fifteen should remain the same. Article 24 should add the phrase "in situations that endanger national security" as a restriction. Article 149, "The interpretation of the constitution shall be made by the Judicial Yuan," should be interpreted by a special agency. We advocate that a certain number of people be established within the National Assembly, with the addition of one or three legislators, to specialize in interpreting the constitution. Article 147, the listed attached items should be cancelled.</p>
<h3 id="e4">Chiang Kai-shek: Outstanding Leader Guiding China Towards Democracy, Washington Post Comments on Our National Assembly <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 1st] The Washington Post commented today that Chairman Chiang Kai-shek is truly the most outstanding Chinese political leader of the present era and can make the National Assembly the beginning of China's genuine democratic development. Only by establishing genuine democracy can the immense potential of the Chinese people be fully realized, and then China can step onto the path of democracy. The newspaper hopes that the National Assembly can carefully examine the constitution draft so that it can become a genuine and feasible democratic constitution to the extent that conditions permit. It believes that the current progress of the National Assembly is of great significance and gratifying.</p>
<h3 id="e5">President Sun Fo Talks to Reporters: Peace Talks Can Resume at Any Time; Argues That It Is Advisable Not to Move the Capital <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 2nd] When President Sun Fo answered questions at a reception for Chinese and foreign journalists at the Central Propaganda Department on the 2nd, he said that peace talks can resume at any time. From the government's perspective, the door to negotiations has not been closed. Regarding rumors that the government will be reorganized during the National Assembly meeting, he had not heard of them. As for whether the Communists will participate in the reorganized government, his view is that if they are willing to participate, there is no problem. A reporter asked his opinion on whether the capital should be in Nanjing or Beijing. Sun Fo believes that since the capital has already been established in Nanjing, it would be advisable not to move the capital unless there is a particularly serious reason, as the relocation of the capital is not an easy matter. During the War of Resistance, we chose Chongqing as the capital out of necessity. Now that we have returned to Nanjing, unless there is an unavoidable accident, I believe that it should not be changed casually. As for whether the location of the capital should be explicitly stipulated in the constitution, Sun Fo's view is that if the issue of establishing the capital has not been disputed, it is acceptable for the constitution not to explicitly stipulate it. Now that a problem has occurred, if it is not explicitly stipulated in the constitution, people's hearts will easily be shaken, and it will be enough to affect work. Therefore, he advocates that the constitution should have provisions for the capital.</p>
<h3 id="e6">National Assembly Delegates Have No Term of Office <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>In addition to answering the above questions, President Sun Fo also answered questions about the National Assembly and the constitution draft. The important points are as follows:</p>
<p>Question: A small number of delegates in the National Assembly are brewing the issue of constitutional implementation. I hope the President can explain this movement.</p>
<p>Answer: This question should be raised to those who are brewing this movement, as I have not participated in this issue.</p>
<h3 id="e7">Youth Party Establishment Anniversary: Special Reception for Chinese and Foreign Journalists to Explain the Party's History and Political Views <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 2nd] The 2nd was the 23rd anniversary of the establishment of the Chinese Youth Party. The party held a press conference at the lounge of the National Assembly Hall at 1:30 PM in the afternoon to report on the party's history and political views. More than 200 Chinese and foreign journalists attended. The party's Secretary-General Chen Qitian presided over the meeting. In addition to the report, he also answered questions from reporters. The meeting ended at about 2:00 PM. In the evening, the Youth Party held a dinner party at Kangle Garden, which was attended by more than 100 people, which was a grand event. The main points of Chen Qitian's speech are as follows: Today is the 23rd anniversary of the establishment of our party. The National Assembly delegates of our party take this opportunity to welcome you and briefly report our party's propositions: A. The Youth Party was established on December 2, 1923, and has been fighting for democratic politics for 23 years. B. The Youth Party has three fundamentals: (1) Nationalism, (2) Democratic Politics, (3) Social Legislation. C. Objectives: To create a modern national state with full welfare for all the people internally and to promote a peaceful world of equality and cooperation externally. D. Characteristics: (1) Neutrality, (2) Constructiveness.</p>
<p>Question: Will the term of office of National Assembly delegates be extended until the date of constitutional implementation begins?</p>
<p>Answer: According to the National Assembly Organizational Law, the task of this National Assembly is only to formulate a constitution and determine the date of constitutional implementation. The term of office of the delegates will end when the task is completed, and the delegates have no term of office.</p>
<h3 id="e8">Explanation of the Two Powers of the National Assembly <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>Question: Today, some people in the general assembly believe that the powers of the National Assembly in the constitution draft are too small, while the powers of the Legislative Yuan are too large. The President is an authority on this issue and is expected to provide an explanation.</p>
<p>Answer: This is a question of interpretation, which cannot be explained in a few words. According to the constitution draft, the National Assembly has two powers, namely, to elect and recall the President and Vice President, to initiate constitutional amendments, and to re-decide on amendments to the constitution proposed by the Legislative Yuan. Generally, people believe that the powers of the National Assembly are too small, or because the "May 5th" constitution draft stipulates that in addition to electing and recalling the President and Vice President, the National Assembly may also appoint and dismiss the presidents and vice presidents of the Legislative Yuan and Supervisory Yuan, as well as legislators and supervisors. At that time, other parties opposed this provision at the Political Consultative Conference. In my view, the four powers exercised by the people are direct civil rights, and the National Assembly is composed of representatives elected by the people. Therefore, what it exercises is only indirect civil rights. According to progressive theory, the President, President of the Legislative Yuan, and President of the Supervisory Yuan should be directly elected by the people, which can be called direct civil rights. China's situation is complex. The election and recall of the President of the Legislative Yuan and the President of the Supervisory Yuan, if all elected by the National Assembly composed of three or four thousand people, may not work. Therefore, there are such alternative methods: the people elect National Assembly delegates, and the National Assembly delegates replace the people in electing or recalling the President and Vice President, while other civil servants are elected by other methods. If all important officials are elected by the National Assembly, not to mention the time involved, it will create a phenomenon of the National Assembly monopolizing national civil rights, which is not in line with the most progressive system of modern times.</p>
<p>Question: Is it true that the proposed amendment to the constitution draft at this National Assembly violates the spirit of the Five-Power Constitution?</p>
<p>Answer: This statement is not entirely accurate. The reason why such a misunderstanding has occurred is because they have not thoroughly studied the constitution draft and have not been able to distinguish the meaning of political power and governing power. Governing power is the power entrusted by the people to handle matters. The Five Yuans are entrusted by the people to handle affairs and should be governing power. However, those who exercise governing power may also exercise political power. For example, civil servants can not only exercise governing power. During elections, civil servants can also vote as citizens, and their right to vote is not deprived because they are civil servants. For example, there are many National Assembly delegates who are also civil servants and can exercise both political power and governing power at the same time. It is completely incomprehensible to say that after exercising governing power, one cannot exercise political power. The general public has a wrong understanding because of unclear concepts.</p>
<h3 id="e9">Provisions on Treaties for Territorial Changes <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>Question: According to Article Four of the constitution draft, the territory of the Republic of China shall not be changed without law. The general public has expressed dissatisfaction with the fact that territory can be changed according to law. What explanation does the President have for this?</p>
<p>Answer: Changes in territory are usually stipulated by treaties. For example, Taiwan was originally occupied by Japan. After the victory of the War of Resistance, the country was restored, and Taiwan rejoined our territory. However, the "legalization" of this matter still requires the formal signing of a peace treaty, and the peace treaty must be approved by the Legislative Yuan to complete the legislative process before it can be established. Therefore, the constitution draft has the provision that "it shall not be changed without law."</p>
<p>Question: Will the constitution draft be greatly modified when it is reviewed by the National Assembly?</p>
<p>Answer: This is not yet known and will be known after the review.</p>
<p>Question: According to the National Assembly Organizational Law, the session of the National Assembly is set for ten to twenty days, which may be extended if necessary. Should the extension of the session be announced by the National Government, or can the National Assembly itself announce the extension, and can it be extended indefinitely?</p>
<p>Answer: The extension of the National Assembly session belongs to the National Assembly itself. It seems unlikely that it will be extended indefinitely.</p>
<p>Question: How many days will the National Assembly be in recess?</p>
<p>Answer: The constitution draft review committee has been established in groups and can start the review work. During the review process, the general assembly will be suspended for about ten days. The date of the recess has not been decided.</p>
<p>Question: What is the President's view on the fact that the Youth Party did not attend the supplementary swearing-in ceremony at the National Assembly the other day?</p>
<p>Answer: I did not hear the explanation made by the Youth Party on this (reporter's note: the Youth Party held a press conference at the same place before the press conference of the Central Propaganda Department).</p>
<h3 id="e10">A Sketch of the Sixth National Assembly <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>— Our Reporters: Pu Dejie, Zhang Ming</p>
<p>The sixth session of the National Assembly was the most peaceful session since it began. Before noon, Chairman Bai Chongxi repeatedly reminded the representatives to speak at the podium and to maintain order. Lei Zhen arranged the order of speakers to his left, while Hong Lanyou sat quietly to his right, resting. The first presidium was invited twice, but no one went up.</p>
<p>Despite the peaceful atmosphere, there was no shortage of brilliant speeches. The speeches of Yang Yifeng, Pan Gongzhan, Chen Guyuan, and Zhang Zhiben were all listened to attentively by the audience and received much applause. Besides those speakers, most of the representatives did not listen, but were either chatting or reading newspapers. When Di Ying and Zhang Mojun were discussing matters, Zhang took out his recent work, which Di praised greatly. Ma Xingye proofread his Central Daily News, reading Xu Zhaochang's article "Nanjing in the Ming Dynasty" from the "Mountain and Sea" section, word by word, from beginning to end. Hu Shi once strode out slowly and then slowly strode back. Everyone was writing freely.</p>
<p>Yang Yifeng, a representative from Henan, began his speech by saying, "There are two proposals regarding the location of the capital: one is Nanjing, and the other is Beiping. I advocate for Beiping to be the capital!" His concise and straightforward statement immediately earned him thunderous applause. He then listed four reasons, each of which was met with a round of applause. The reporters in the press area also cheered, "Go to Beiping!" The wave of support for making Beiping the capital flowed through everyone's heart.</p>
<p>Pan Gongzhan, a specially-invited representative, spoke first, raising five questions about the draft constitution amendment, two of which concerned special municipalities. He said, "I come from Shanghai, and I want to ask on behalf of the citizens of Shanghai, is there still a need for special municipalities in the administrative system? If so, will special municipalities elect representatives to the National Assembly? And how can the status of special municipalities be determined by the Legislative Yuan? These should all be clearly stipulated in the constitution." This immediately sparked enthusiastic applause, and the photographers from various Shanghai newspapers all rushed forward.</p>
<p>Chen Guyuan, a specially-invited representative, began by saying, "I dare not say the word 'constitutional rule' because I am afraid it will cause 'division'. However, there are contradictory points in the draft constitutional amendment, and there are many other technical problems. The wording, sentence arrangement, and all aspects are lacking." He then gave examples, one by one. Each example received a round of applause, echoing Yang Yifeng's earlier speech, proving his worth as a legislator.</p>
<p>Zhang Zhiben, a specially-invited representative, is an old legal scholar. As soon as he stepped onto the podium, he received a warm welcome. He said, "The constitution we are about to create must have three conditions: progress, perfection, and rationality. The current draft constitutional amendment, in a nutshell, is a makeshift. But this is a matter of a hundred years, and it must not be treated as a makeshift..." (thunderous applause). He also said, "We must not use 'the people's level is not high enough' as an excuse to deprive the people of their political power. In the world, only the government's level is not high enough, not the people's. Great undertakings are all accomplished by the power of the people. For example, the government is the driver of a car, and the people are the passengers. Only the driver has the issue of level—whether they can drive or not. There is no issue of level for the passengers, saying whether they know how to sit or not." The applause was thunderous. Time was up, but the old man's words were not finished. According to the rules, he apologized and wanted to step down, but the audience said, "Keep talking, keep talking!" Di Ying took the agenda and stood up, waving it, "Please continue to finish!" Chairman Bai immediately agreed to extend the time. Only after the old man finished speaking did he step down amidst applause.</p>
<p>Li Zhengle, a representative from the Sui District, with graying temples, spoke with passion, shaking his head and gesticulating. Expressing his views on the Mongolian banner system, he said, "Speaking of the Sui District alone, we not only do not discriminate against our Mongolian compatriots, but we have also tried our best to treat them favorably. The number of provincial councilors is proportionally higher for Mongolians than for Han Chinese, and the burden of paying taxes and grain is less for Mongolians than for Han Chinese. I advocate that the administrative system should not have a dual track." The Mongolian representatives did not react. The Eighth Review Committee of the Constitutional Draft, which specializes in reviewing the Mongolian and Tibetan local systems, has already been established, and they have already achieved victory.</p>
<p>The morning session continued without a break. At exactly twelve o'clock, the representatives said, "Time is up." Chairman Bai then announced that the discussion would be suspended and the session would continue in the afternoon. Deputy Secretary-General Lei announced that the Youth Party would hold a press reception tea party in celebration of its founding anniversary, moving from the Overseas Chinese Reception Center to the representatives' lounge of the National Assembly Hall at 1:30 PM. The press reception of the Central Propaganda Department will be held at 2:00 PM in the lounge on the second floor of the Assembly Hall. The reporters, who were worried about being in two places at once, breathed a sigh of relief and smiled.</p>
<p>When the labor union representatives requested that the National Assembly add a clause for professional groups, they also made this request for women's groups, and thunderous applause erupted from the women's representatives' seats. At the same time, it spread to the entire venue. This was the most brilliant speech of the afternoon session.</p>
<p>Liu Hengjing, the female chairperson of the presidium, stepped up to speak today with an extremely composed demeanor, giving all the representatives a considerable sense of respect. She spoke after Representative Sun, and so, while fighting for rights, she also made a special mention of the rights of farmers and workers. This response was the best. (December 2nd)</p>

<p>[United Press, Beiping, 2nd] Northeast Communist Army Commander Lin Biao today accepted the US proposal to establish a US inspection team at his headquarters in Harbin. However, due to too many attached conditions, sources close to certain knowledgeable quarters claim that the Executive Headquarters has expressed dissatisfaction. One of the most stringent conditions is that US personnel are not allowed to use their own wireless equipment. The US representatives to the Executive Headquarters suggested establishing an inspection team in Harbin after the executive groups of the Headquarters withdrew from the Communist-controlled areas of Qiqihar, Lafa, and Shuangcheng in the Northeast. The withdrawal of the groups was due to Lin Biao's claim that he could not guarantee their safety.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 2nd] According to unconfirmed reports from the government today, Communist Army Commander-in-Chief Zhu De went to Moscow on November 20 on an important military mission. It is unknown when he will return. The Chinese Communists are purchasing large quantities of goods in the "Liberated Areas" in preparation for exchanging them for Soviet military equipment.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 2nd] It is said that Ye Jianying flew to Harbin to discuss the establishment of liaison personnel in Harbin, according to people from the Communist Party in the Executive Headquarters. Local people believe that this is a false statement, and that Ye's departure must have been entrusted with an important mission. It is rumored here that Mao Zedong is in Harbin, and it is speculated that Ye's trip is related to Marshal Ma's arrival in Beiping. In addition, his assistant Huang Hua secretly returned to Yan'an on the 27th, and returned on the same day. He publicly declared to reporters in Beiping that women and children had been evacuated from Yan'an and that they were actively preparing for war.</p>

<p>[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch, 2nd] According to reliable sources: Jin Zhanen, the Communist political commissar of northern Jiangsu, recently returned from the Northeast and immediately ordered his troops to adopt guerrilla and flanking tactics to avoid frontal battles with the National Army. If the National Army launches a full-scale counterattack in northern Jiangsu, they plan to abandon northern Jiangsu as much as possible and flee to southern Jiangsu in order to seize opportunities and threaten the capital.</p>
<p>[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch, 2nd] The highway from Huaiyin to Siyang was destroyed by the Communist army in late November, making it impassable. It is now being actively repaired by the National Army and civilians, and traffic has resumed as normal.</p>
<p>[Our Taixian Dispatch, 1st] This reporter followed Commander Li into Caoyan early this morning. All the highway bridges north of Dingxi were destroyed by the Communist army. This reporter walked with the commander to the area. Along the way, people returning to their hometowns were coming and going in an endless stream. The residents did their best to assist in transportation when the National Army entered, and welcomed the arrival of the National Army with extremely excited expressions.</p>
<p>[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch, 2nd] Military news: As of the 30th of last month, the Communist army on the outskirts of Lianghuai and within the borders of Suxuisi has switched to a defensive posture due to repeated setbacks in their offensives. After the National Army reopened the Xuhuai Highway, the situation completely changed. It is reported that the Communist army in northern Jiangsu, Zhang Aiping's unit and Li Yu's unit, suffered losses of more than five divisions and more than two thousand officers and soldiers were captured. It is impossible to replenish them in a short time. It is expected that the war situation in northern Jiangsu will have a decisive development within the next week. The recovered areas of northern Jiangsu are exempt from corvée, military service, and taxes, which has become a reality. The field grain divisions and field grain sections of Lianghuai, Su, Si, Xu, Gao, Bao, Xing, and Dong counties have not yet been established. It is also reported that during this transition period, the county governments are able to respect the central government's intentions and have not arbitrarily levied grain taxes or apportioned tasks. However, the general public hopes that the central government will issue an early decree exempting taxes and postponing the conscription of strongmen, so that they can return to their hometowns with peace of mind to make a living.</p>

<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 2nd] Sun Yueqi, Deputy Chairman of the Resources Committee, attended a press conference of the Central Propaganda Department at about 2:00 PM on the afternoon of the 2nd, reporting on the transportation and mineral resources in the Northeast. Minister Peng first gave a brief introduction, saying that Sun was the "Coal King" of China and had traveled all over the Northeast in recent years, and was extremely familiar with the transportation and mineral resources of the area. Then, Sun pointed to the large map and gave a general introduction to the Northeast, saying that the Northeast is the most prosperous area in China, and its prosperity is unparalleled anywhere in the world. The Northeast is not only rich in agricultural products on the ground, but also has many mineral deposits underground, and what is even more rare is that there are many good harbors, which are extremely convenient for import and export. Sun then described the territory and river transportation of the Northeast. When talking about the construction of railways, he solemnly pointed out that the occurrence of the September 18 Incident was mainly due to the success of our railway policy in the Northeast. On the eve of the Northeast Incident, the railways we built not only connected the three northeastern provinces, but also surrounded the Chinese Eastern and South Manchurian Railways. Moreover, our Huludao Port was more convenient than the Russian and Japanese ports of Vladivostok, which led to the Japanese invasion. At present, there are six major railway hubs in the Northeast, namely Jinzhou, Shenyang, Sipingjie, Changchun, Harbin, and Jiamusi. In terms of industry, before September 18, our country used three agricultural products to establish three industries, namely oil mills for squeezing soybeans, flour mills for grinding wheat, and distilleries for refining sorghum. There are two main minerals in the Northeast, namely coal and iron. The former had an annual output of 25.5 million tons before the victory. There are eight major mining areas, including Beipiao, Fuxin, Fushun, and Benxihu. The main iron mines are Anshan, Muxi Lake, and Tonghua, all located in the south. In terms of electricity, there are four major power plants in total. One plant is hydroelectric, and the other two are thermal power. The total power generation capacity is 2 million kilowatts, and the total length of power lines reaches 12,000 kilometers.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 2nd] In order to launch a full-scale treason, partition the border areas, and covet the Great Northwest, the Northwest Bureau of the Communist Party recently published an article addressed to all members of the Communist Party. A summary of its contents is as follows: (1) In order to defeat the government army and establish a communist New China, we must defend the border areas and liberate the Great Northwest. (2) The Northwest occupies one-third of the country's area and is an area of mutual assistance between the three democratic countries of China, [missing characters]. Therefore, our army must first depart from the northern Qian, control Jianlin, and another unit must advance towards Yimeng to echo each other; (3) The northern line has already conquered important strongholds on the periphery in the first phase, and is currently carrying out the second phase, eliminating Fu Zuoyi's troops, eliminating obstacles in the northwest, and preparing to launch the third phase; (4) In order to develop the Great Northwest plan and control the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia and Jin-Sui border areas, we must quickly change the overall strategy and resolutely take the initiative to attack. The consolidation and expansion of the two border areas include Inner Mongolia, Suiyuan, Baotou, Ningxia, Lanzhou, so as to develop into a central base for the two liberated area regimes; (5) To accomplish the above tasks, we can only cooperate with the main force to launch large-scale wars, harass everywhere, destroy all transportation lines and transportation, and destroy the entire social and economic organization. First, we must create poverty for all the people, and then use their dissatisfaction with the status quo to instigate them, lure them, and make them use us. Only in this way can we develop, survive, and be happy.</p>

<h3 id="e26">On the Political System in the Constitutional Draft <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Ruxuan</p>
<p>Regarding the National Assembly in the Constitutional Draft, I have already written an article with my opinions. Now, I will further express my views on the central and local political systems stipulated in the Constitutional Draft:</p>
<p>(1) The Executive Yuan is responsible to the Legislative Yuan: The Constitutional Draft of May 5th stipulates that the President appoints and dismisses the President and Ministers of the Executive Yuan. Each is responsible to the President; and the President is elected and dismissed by the National Assembly, and is responsible to the National Assembly. However, the National Assembly only meets once every three years; the time is too long, and the supervision of the administration is inevitably lax. It is feared that the President's control over personnel and administrative power will turn into autocracy. Therefore, the amendment places administrative responsibility on the President of the Executive Yuan. The appointment of the President of the Executive Yuan is nominated by the President and approved by the Legislative Yuan. The Executive Yuan shall be responsible to the Legislative Yuan, and the following provisions shall be made for the manner of its responsibility: 1. The Executive Yuan is responsible for submitting policy reports to the Legislative Yuan, and the Legislative Yuan members have the right to question the Executive Yuan and its ministries and committees. 2. If the Legislative Yuan does not agree with the important policies of the Executive Yuan, it may resolve to request the Executive Yuan to change them. The Executive Yuan may, with the approval of the President, request the Legislative Yuan to reconsider the resolution of the Legislative Yuan. If two-thirds of the Legislative Yuan members present maintain the original resolution during the reconsideration, the President of the Executive Yuan shall accept or resign. 3. If the Executive Yuan considers the laws passed by the Legislative Yuan to be difficult to implement, it may, with the approval of the President, request the Legislative Yuan to reconsider. If two-thirds of the Legislative Yuan members present maintain the original plan during the reconsideration, the President of the Executive Yuan shall execute it or resign. This provision is roughly the same in effect as Article 70 of the May 5th Constitutional Draft, which states that "the President may submit the resolutions passed by the Legislative Yuan to the Legislative Yuan for reconsideration before promulgation? If the Legislative Yuan maintains the original plan by two-thirds of the members present, the President shall promulgate and implement it." However, the amendment does not say "the President shall implement it immediately," but says "the President of the Executive Yuan shall implement it (or accept it) or resign." The intention is to avoid a head-on conflict between the President and the Legislative Yuan on the one hand, and to ensure the implementation of the resolutions of the Legislative Yuan on the other. The method is also appropriate. However, Article 70 of the May 5th Constitutional Draft states that "the President shall promulgate the resolutions passed by the Legislative Yuan within thirty days." This is to prevent the abuses of the US President, who uses the method of non-promulgation (that is, what is called Pocketveto) to resist the Congress; therefore, the time for promulgating the resolutions is specially restricted. If it is not promulgated after the deadline, it is a violation of the Constitution, and the act of violating the Constitution can be impeached. The execution or acceptance of the resolutions of the Legislative Yuan has been fully guaranteed, and whether the administrative side is willing or not, or whether to resign or not, is no longer a matter of importance. This arrangement also seems to be acceptable. As for the "right of inquiry" of the Legislative Yuan to the Executive Yuan stipulated in the amendment, since the Legislative Yuan no longer has the right to vote on confidence to overthrow the cabinet; the so-called "inquiry" is only to ask the Executive Yuan to explain and state its meaning; it is not comparable to the "right of questioning" (Interpellation) possessed by the parliamentary system congress. The "right of questioning" can overthrow the cabinet, and the effect of "inquiry" is at most equal to Questioning. Therefore, the powers of the President to submit reconsideration, the Legislative Yuan's right to approve the President's appointment of the President of the Executive Yuan, the Executive Yuan's report to the Legislative Yuan, and the Legislative Yuan's inquiry to the Executive Yuan, which are listed in the amendment, are mostly the practices of presidential countries. To fulfill their functions, they can only improve the relationship between the legislative and executive branches. It is impossible to create a responsible government in the cabinet system. Therefore, it is my opinion that Article 58 of the amendment, "The Executive Yuan shall be responsible to the Legislative Yuan in accordance with the following provisions," can in fact be deleted; and the following three items of that article can be combined into one item, which seems more logical.</p>
<p>(2) The division of power between the central and local governments: The Constitutional Draft of May 5th takes the county as the unit of local self-government. The county magistrate is elected by the people, and the people directly exercise the four powers (namely, election, recall, initiative, and referendum), while the province is nothing more than an administrative region of the central government. The provincial government is an agency for implementing central government laws and supervising local self-government. The governor is appointed and dismissed by the central government. The organization and powers of the provincial government and the provincial council shall be determined by law. As for the division of power between the central and local governments, it does not adopt the item-by-item enumeration method, but only makes a unilateral regulation in principle: "All matters that are suitable for local conditions shall be classified as local self-government matters"; and "local self-government matters shall be determined by law." In other words, the power of local self-government is not listed in the Constitution; but is received from the laws and regulations of the central government, which is a purely unitary system. Most countries in England and France are like this. The draft amendment is completely the opposite; it divides local self-government into two levels: province and county. The governor and county magistrate are elected by the people; both have elected councils. The most noteworthy point is the strict division of power between the central and provincial governments. Some are legislated by the central government and executed by the central government: such as foreign affairs, national defense, monetary system, etc., a total of thirteen items; some are legislated by the central government and can be executed by the provinces: such as agriculture, forestry, industry, mining, commerce, education system, etc., a total of seventeen items; some are legislated and executed by the provinces or executed by the counties, such as provincial and municipal finance, police, transportation, etc., a total of ten items, all listed in detail. As for the self-government laws of each province, they are not promulgated by the central government; but are formulated by the provincial people's congresses convened by each province. Within the scope of not conflicting with the national constitution, the central government shall not interfere. Moreover, because the powers of the province and the central government are listed in the national constitution, the provincial power and the central power are parallel; within the scope of their delineated powers, the central government and the province cannot infringe upon each other. If the provincial power needs to be adjusted, there is no other way except to amend the national constitution. It cannot be handled or changed by the laws of the Legislative Yuan. This method of decentralization is only found in federal countries. The power of the state and the power of the central government are listed in the national constitution; it is the iron rule of decentralization in the federal system. The difference between the federal and unitary systems lies not in the size of the self-government power, but in the source of the self-government power. In a unitary country, the power of the locality is received from the central government; and the power of the central government is received from the constitution. In a federal country, the power of the central government is received from the constitution, and the power of the locality is also received from the constitution. The self-government power received from the central government can be changed by the central government by law; the self-government power received from the constitution has the same status as the central power, and cannot be changed by the central government. For example, the US Federal Constitution lists the powers of the central government, and all powers not listed are attributed to the states; the scope is wider. Another example is the Canadian Provincial Constitution, which lists the powers of each province, and all powers not listed are attributed to the central government, so the scope of provincial self-government is narrower. Although these two methods of decentralization are different; because the self-government powers of the federal states are received from the constitution, they are all standard federal systems. Most federal countries such as Switzerland, Germany, and Austria are similar. Therefore, the chapter on "The Powers of the Central and Local Governments" in the amendment adopts the federal decentralization system. (Moreover, the method of listing the powers of the central and local governments in that chapter is exactly the same as Chapter 5 of the Constitution promulgated during the Cao Kun era in 1923, and that constitution also adopted federalism). Moreover, the chapter on "Provincial and County System" in the amendment stipulates that the provincial self-government law shall be formulated by the provincial people's congresses convened by each province. In addition to having an elected governor and council, all organizations can be freely created, as long as they "do not conflict with the Constitution." Therefore, as long as it does not conflict with the Constitution, the "self-government law" and the organizational law of the provincial government of each province are not subject to interference by the central government. This special status is only available to the state constitution or provincial constitution of a federal country (such as the state constitution of each state in the United States and the provincial constitution of each province in Canada, which cannot be amended by the Congress); as for a unitary country, the local self-government laws and regulations are all passed and promulgated by the Congress. The scope of self-government can be expanded as much as possible, but the source of power is from the central government, and the central government always maintains its supervisory position over the locality; this is the major difference between the provincial self-government law and the provincial constitution. The so-called "provincial self-government law" in the amendment is completely created by the locality; the central government cannot interfere. Its independent nature is the same as the state constitution of a federal country; it is better to call it "provincial constitution" instead of "provincial self-government law" to be more accurate.</p>
<p>In short, the provincial system and provincial power stipulated in the amendment (that is, Chapters 10 and 11) fully express federalism. If this is implemented, China should become a federal state; therefore, Article 1 of the original plan should be changed to "The Republic of China is a Federal Republic"; and the "Provincial Self-Government Law" in Chapter 10 should also be changed to Provincial Constitution to be more clear and avoid ambiguity. I must solemnly state here that federalism is by no means separatism. Every federal country in the world has a strong central government that controls the major powers of the country's diplomacy, military administration, national defense, monetary system, and tariffs. These major powers, which are related to the whole country, are never allowed to be interfered with by the locality. From this point of view, it is not impossible to say that the federation is a unified and centralized system. In the past, some people in our country advocated "provincial self-government," advocating the independence of each province, using the theory of plural sovereignty and the equality of provinces and countries as a shield, and using the name of provincial self-government to carry out the reality of feudal separatism; these are all sinners of federalism. I hope readers will analyze them and do not mislabel them. The above discussion is because Lan Yin sees that Chapters 10 and 11 in the amendment are obviously an unstated federal system, so he does not hesitate to point it out repeatedly to show its difference from the Constitutional Draft of May 5th. As for which is better, the federal system or the unitary system, and which is more suitable for our country, I am too shallow and dare not make a judgment rashly. I hope those who know will think deeply and choose carefully.</p>
<p>Other less important criticisms and technical issues regarding the provisions are not yet fully covered due to the length of the article. In short, the constitution is a great law for the whole country to abide by for a hundred years. The wording should be concise, and the reasoning should be clear. There should be no ambiguity, so that people can hardly tell the difference. It should be as orderly as a chessboard and as bright as the sun, so that those who enforce the law can follow the main road, which is as flat as a whetstone and as straight as an arrow, so that the spirit of the great law can be permanently maintained. Although there are many advantages, there are still many shortcomings that are not clear. I would like to present one or two of them for the reference of the wise and to correct them.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper Suzhou, 2nd] Zhang Fengsheng, a native of Zhejiang, who once served as a counselor in the puppet army Li Changjiang's department, chairman of the puppet Taidian County Cooperative, and chairman of the puppet flour and wheat control committee, etc., was sentenced to two years of imprisonment by the criminal court of the Suzhou High Court. The prosecutor in charge of the case, Jiang Yaozu, believes that the traitor relied on the enemy's power to oppress workers, control materials, and manipulate flour and wheat during his tenure in various puppet positions, and even donated copper coins stored in the factory to the enemy. The traces of treason are very obvious. Not only is the investigation clear, but also the witnesses Jia Ayin and Wang Genbao have testified repeatedly. The crimes of affecting the Anti-Japanese War are very serious. The original sentence of the lowest punishment is inappropriate. Moreover, the fact that he served as a puppet counselor and donated copper coins were not discussed, which is even more inappropriate. Therefore, he filed an appeal in accordance with the law on the 2nd, requesting the Supreme Court to review the sentence.</p>

After arriving in the town, Lu Qiying was arrested by Wang and handcuffed. Unexpectedly, Qian Guonian, the current town chief of the town, ignored the law and falsely reported to the local police station that he was capturing bandits. For a time, the police station believed it to be true and fired warning shots, causing great chaos. Deputy Captain Yu opened the door to investigate and was searched all over. A copy of the wanted order for Lu Qiying issued by the Third District Commissioner's Office of Jiangsu was found on the spot and torn up by the town chief.

<p>[Our Newspaper Suzhou, 2nd] The Raw Material Cotton Yarn of the Cloth Industry Association in this county is purchased on the black market, which is 40% more expensive than the allocation price in Shanghai. The production cost is too high, and it cannot be sold like Shanghai goods. Therefore, in the past two months, 10 factories have closed down. The existing 42 factories are also in danger. The public is anxious and cannot live a day. Representatives were sent to Shanghai to contact the textile company to seek treatment and request yarn allocation according to the precedent, but they returned without success. On the 2nd, an emergency meeting of all members was convened, and it was generally believed that if this continues, the cloth industry has no other way to go except for collective bankruptcy. The way to save it is to quickly obtain the right to allocate raw materials. After the decision, on the one hand, a petition was submitted to the relevant agencies such as the Suzhou Provisional Council, and on the other hand, the cloth industries in the four counties of Yu, Xi, Wu, and Cheng jointly submitted a petition to the ministries and institutes of the National Government, pouring out the current crisis and requesting approval to allocate cotton yarn equally in accordance with the Shanghai precedent.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper Chongming] Before the war, this county was under the jurisdiction of the Fourth District Commissioner's Office, but there is no direct ferry between Chongming and Nantong, and all traffic must pass through Shanghai, which is very inconvenient. Not only is it time-consuming and costly, but also the implementation of government orders is often separated. Moreover, the customs, customs, language, and habits of Chongming are very similar to those of Jiangnan, which is very different from Nantong. Economically, it can be regarded as a link in Shanghai, and has nothing to do with Nantong. The gentry Lu Jiajun and others made a special trip to the province to request that Chongming be re-affiliated to the Third District Commissioner's Office. The people of the county also submitted petitions, asking to accept public opinion and quickly re-affiliate to facilitate rehabilitation and construction. The provincial government is now considering this issue.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper Suxian] The Suxian Tax Collection Office recently sent an investigator Hu to Suixi Town to investigate the capital of various businesses as a tax standard. Because it did not contact the Chamber of Commerce, and the standard for measuring capital was too high, some merchants used goods stored for customers as capital, and some used furniture and odds and ends, even a pot and a bowl, as capital. Even renting a house or borrowing a house was included in the capital, and the estimated value was increased by hundreds or thousands of times. Without any accommodation, it caused dissatisfaction among the merchants and all the merchants went on strike and appealed to all sectors.</p>

<h3 id="e43">In the Rural Areas of Eastern Sea – Observations from the Comforting and Recovering Areas <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>— By Our Correspondent, Li Shangnong</p>
<p>Since the National Army recovered several important strongholds in Northern Jiangsu, such as Suqian, Siyang, and Huaiyin, the Communist troops entrenched in the southwestern rural areas of the East China Sea county were shaken and panicked, showing signs of collapse. Consequently, the returning home defense corps of the East China Sea County, led by Regiment Commander Ni Aitang, began a homecoming counterattack against the Communist troops within the county. They successively recovered Pingming, Chendun, Zhuowang, Ponan, Shangfang, Jidang, Xinggou, Baisha, Xiafang, Nanliu, and other villages.</p>
<p>To comfort the recovered area residents, understand the general situation, promote party and government work, and implement relief efforts, the East China Sea County Magistrate Zhou Tian, the County Party Secretary, the Chief Secretary of the Youth League East China Sea Branch Dong Lifu, and the former head of the homecoming defense corps, Ni Aitang, gathered at the East China Sea County Government at 9:00 AM on November 21st and departed for the recovered area. This reporter also participated in the trip.</p>
<p>We traveled over twenty li of dry land by rickshaw out of the city to the bank of the Qiangwei River. A sailboat was prepared in advance, and the wind was favorable, allowing the boat to move like a horse. Boards were laid on the deck, and as we looked around, the harvested autumn crops had already died due to the Communist troops diverting the canal water, leaving only the dry yellow branches on the top swaying in the wind. The water in the fields had not completely receded. In some places, the water in the fields was connected to the river, making them indistinguishable. In the distance, sparse villages were scattered amidst the water.</p>
<p>As the boat moved alongside the reeds, countless water birds were startled by the sound of the oars and flew into the sky. Along the riverbanks, fishermen had set up many fish traps and crab weirs. In the grass, there were still lingering autumn insects chirping, like the final gasps of dying refugees!</p>
<p>At 3:00 PM, we arrived at Xinba. The party and government leaders immediately summoned the district chiefs and all the residents to give speeches, conveying the government's utmost concern for the compatriots in the recovered area. The next morning, we set off again by boat from Xinba. The weather was clear, and the autumn scenery was pleasant. We passed through Zhuowang Lake, where the residents, having been informed in advance, gathered on the riverbank to welcome us, supporting the old and leading the young. The inspection team immediately ordered the boat to dock and disembarked one by one to exchange greetings with the local residents. County Magistrate Zhou also delivered a message of comfort.</p>
<p>The welcoming residents spontaneously offered baskets of eggs and teapots of tea to the comforting team. The leaders politely declined and set off again. At 4:00 PM, we arrived at Shangfang. The village had been occupied by the Communist troops four times, each time driven out by our forces. The houses and bunkers in the village were destroyed by artillery fire and demolished by the Communist troops, leaving rubble everywhere and a desolate scene.</p>
<p>That evening, the comforting team traveled to the Yishui Wang Village for the night. At dawn on the third day, we again boarded the boat and arrived at Pingming Township. After disembarking and gathering the residents to comfort them, we inspected the nearby villages. The local residents, having been ravaged by the Communist troops, were in dire straits, with most homes empty, barely clothed, and underfed. The people's faces showed signs of suffering. Seeing the government officials arrive to offer comfort, they tearfully grabbed their clothes and recounted the various atrocities of the Communist troops, expressing their hatred and resentment with tears in their eyes. The people who had not yet returned home and were still wandering outside unanimously begged the county magistrate to issue them firearms, vowing to fight the Communist troops to the death, return to their hometowns, and rebuild their fields.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, we planned to continue to Chewang and other villages, but the land was flooded, making it difficult to move around. Therefore, we turned the boat around and returned.</p>

<p>[Our Dispatch] Paris, 2nd (Radio from London): Governor-General Wavell of India and leaders of various Indian political parties, having taken a special plane from India via Basra, Cairo, and Malta to England, are expected to arrive here today.</p>
<p>Another dispatch states that the plane carrying the Governor-General and others was forced to land in Malta due to minor mechanical issues.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] London, 2nd (Radio): The British Cabinet convened this morning to discuss the detailed agenda for the Anglo-Indian talks. The Anglo-Indian talks will begin here tomorrow, with both sides exchanging views.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Cairo, 1st] Governor-General Wavell of India, along with Indian leaders, arrived here today by special plane and stayed overnight before continuing to London tomorrow. Nehru said upon disembarking that there were no disputes between Hindus and Muslims in India, and that the problems were mostly related to political views. When asked whether the London conference could eliminate the friction between the Congress Party and the Muslim League, Nehru replied that one could not be pessimistic or optimistic in politics, but could only do one's best. Jinnah, the leader of the Muslim League, said that before going to London, Prime Minister Attlee had assured him that he would re-examine the entire Indian situation, and that he would continue to fight for the ninety million Muslims in India and would never accept a constitution that would subjugate Muslims.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, New Delhi, 1st Dispatch] The Indian police and the group of Nehru, Jinnah, Qari Khan, and Singh flew to London this morning. After their departure, India's political center temporarily shifted to the British capital. The main talks between Indian leaders and British ministers will begin on the 3rd. According to dispatches from London, Indian leaders will be treated as plenipotentiaries, and the meeting will be held at 10 Downing Street. British Prime Minister Attlee finally persuaded the Indian party leaders to visit London with perseverance. The Congress Party leaders initially rejected the invitation but later accepted it. Jinnah, the chairman of the Muslim League, initially accepted but then hesitated before finally agreeing to participate in the London talks. After Jinnah accepted the invitation, he heard that Attlee had given Nehru certain guarantees and therefore put forward a condition for his visit to London. Jinnah telegraphed Attlee, saying that unless they could discuss the entire situation, there would be no point in him going to London. Attlee replied that Jinnah's refusal to travel was due to a misunderstanding of his telegram to Nehru, which did not detract from the full consideration of all views. Defense Minister Singh, the representative of the Sikh community, said before leaving India that the Sikh community would resist any attempt to partition India. Home Minister Patel, who rejected the British invitation, gave a speech yesterday, saying that the biggest problem facing India was how to reject social problems. The Muslim League was inclined towards a divided India, even at the cost of bloodshed, while other parties opposed partition under any circumstances and would not be contaminated by the Muslim League's strategy. Patel's rejection of the invitation reflected the Congress Party's disapproval of the London conference. Informed sources doubt whether Nehru will act on behalf of the Congress Party without consulting Patel and Congress Party Chairman Kriplani, but if the British and Indian leaders can jointly promote an agreement on the procedures for convening a constitutional conference before the parliamentary session, and enable the Muslim League to participate in the conference, it will make a great contribution to India's constitutional drafting.</p>

<p>[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 1st] Regarding the visit of former British Minister to Syria and Lebanon Spears to the Near East, the Soviet journal "New Times" commented with an article titled "General Spears' Visit is Bound to Fail," stating that Spears' visit to the Near East aimed to organize a military alliance with Arab countries to ensure British dominance in the Near East. Spears has a considerable reputation in the Near East, and everyone knows that he is a British imperialist agent in Arab countries. He has repeatedly given speeches, always emphasizing the friendship between Britain and Arab countries and their common interests, but the Arab people and newspapers have unanimously opposed his proposed plan. The article stated that Spears' plan attempted to gain the cooperation of Arab countries, but the presence of British troops in Arab countries was the real danger, so Arab countries should make British troops withdraw as soon as possible. This shows that the British government's situation is very difficult. The British Foreign Office representative declared on the 15th of last month that General Spears' trip to the Near East was purely a private trip and that he had not been given any official mission. In short, Spears' trip is bound to fail, but we must note that this is not the first, nor the last, attempt.</p>

<h3 id="e52">Universal Disarmament Proposal Temporarily Shelved; Veto Power Re-Discussed; United Nations General Assembly Political Committee Meets for Three Hours; Countries Still Fail to Reach Agreement <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 1st] At today's meeting of the Political and Security Committee of the United Nations General Assembly, US Representative Connally called on the five permanent members of the United Nations to limit the use of the veto power, stating, "No" country can independently embark on the path to peace, but must move forward together. No country can independently dominate the world, history has shattered this dream. " The committee discussed the issue of limiting the use of the veto power for three hours, but no agreement was reached. Finally, a vote of thirty-three to eight passed to transfer the case to a small committee to try to draft a resolution.

<h3 id="e53">British Restriction Plan Contains Seven Key Points <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 1st] Britain today proposed a plan in the Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly to restrict the exercise of the veto power, but advocated that the five permanent members of the Security Council should still retain this privilege to prevent future problems related to the safety of each country from being overwhelmed by the majority vote of other countries, resulting in an irreparable situation. The Soviet Union immediately put forward a counter-proposal, opposing changing the veto power in any way. The committee was so busy discussing this issue that it had to temporarily shelve the issue of universal disarmament in the world.</p>
<p>The British proposal includes the following seven recommendations: (1) The five permanent members with veto power may consult with each other before voting in order to reach consensus. (2) If the five permanent members cannot reach consensus, the minority of them should consider that they are acting in the interests of the entire United Nations, so they must exercise the veto power only when it has a significant impact on the overall interests of the United Nations. (3) The five permanent members should not exercise the veto power simply because a certain proposal does not fully meet their wishes. (4) The five permanent members may propose rules of procedure in the Security Council, but this must be proposed only after all methods have been tried and failed, and must be proposed using proper methods. (5) The five permanent members may propose to add rules of procedure to the Security Council, such as forming a conciliation committee before the final discussion and vote. (6) In order to define the definition of "dispute," first agree on several methods to facilitate the proceedings. (7) Abstaining from voting by a permanent member shall not be considered an exercise of the veto power. Not attending the meeting and therefore not participating in the vote by a permanent member shall also not be considered an exercise of the veto power.</p>
<p>After British representative Shawcross made the above suggestions, he also asked the Soviet Union to make some concessions and jointly agree on a practical solution for the public interest. Shawcross also said, "We must have a new concept and a new solution for major interests. The abuse of the veto power is not the disease itself, but only a symptom. The disease is the lack of trust, suspicion, and hostility, which casts a dark shadow on the relationship between great powers." Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky then proposed that the General Assembly pass a resolution stating, "This meeting now trusts that the Security Council will be able to fully consider its past experience in the future and achieve a situation where various resolutions can be agreed upon."</p>

<p>[Reuters, Athens, 2nd] British Imperial Chief of Staff Marshal Montgomery, after arriving here yesterday on a tour of Palestine, had dinner with Greek King George. Athens police have taken special security measures to protect Montgomery and prevent activities by Jewish terrorist groups. Montgomery is expected to stay here for three days and will convene a meeting of British generals.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Athens, 1st] Greek Prime Minister Tsaldaris said before leaving for New York today that Greece had no intention of complaining, but only to state Greece's future borders to the Security Council. It is said that Tsaldaris will go to New York to talk to the foreign ministers of the four great powers about the current situation in Greece, as well as Greece's demands for North Epirus Province and the adjustment of the Greek-Albanian border for strategic reasons. He will also discuss the issue of financial assistance to Greece with British and American officials. Tsaldaris is scheduled to return home on December 15th. According to authoritative sources, the Greek delegation will submit the Greek case to the Security Council on Tuesday. The Greek Prime Minister met with the Soviet Charge d'Affaires last night to explain that Greece hoped to resolve all issues with its northern neighbors in a friendly manner based on the Charter of the United Nations. The Greek Prime Minister's visit to the United States will temporarily shelve the Greek political turmoil. Although the "rebel" attempt to appoint deputies to replace the majority seats in Parliament has been temporarily postponed, observers believe that their attempt to organize a coalition government is now focused on engaging in indirect negotiations with various parties. Observers believe that after Tsaldaris returns from the United States, he can carry out the reorganization of the government without causing a real crisis.</p>

A riot broke out in Clarksburg, West Virginia. According to police reports, someone attempted to burn down a non-union coal mine that continued to operate, leading to a conflict.

<p>British Channel in Full View</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Liverpool, 1st] The Port of Liverpool will install the world's largest radar equipment, with a screen larger than ten feet square, making it the most modern radar equipment area in the British Isles. The Mersey Docks and Harbour Board plans to use radar to observe the movements of various ships in the English Channel. This radar installation will cost 30,000 pounds, approximately US$120,000, and will be installed on a tower on Gladstone Dock. According to Hurd, the marine surveyor of the Mersey Docks and Harbour Board, the Port Authority hopes to speed up the handling of various ships and save time and money for shipping companies. In case of fog, the position of each ship and its nearby obstacles can be accurately reported to the pilots. By using radar equipment on the shore, we can instruct the pilots the ship's location and its relationship to other ships, and use the reflector to find buoys blown away by the wind. In addition, radar can be used to enable salvage ships to rescue ships in distress in any weather. Recently, a salvage ship used radar to discover a floating mine in a thick fog where objects could not be seen beyond 100 yards and destroyed it. This mine had drifted 14 miles out of the harbor channel.</p>

<p>[Agence France-Presse, Berlin, 1st] Allied police authorities have recently discovered an unprecedentedly sadistic demon in German criminal files. This demon, named Rock, murdered 45 women and four married couples in Berlin between February 1914 and March 1943. Rock started killing as early as the age of sixteen. His mother was a laundry woman in a hospital who lived in the town of Köpenick on the outskirts of Berlin. Every day, she sent her son to return the cleaned clothes to customers. Whenever Rock encountered single women, he attacked them with any weapon at hand, including axes, knives, hammers, sticks, and ropes. When encountering the person who was about to suffer, this monster raped them completely, sometimes dismembering the corpse and leaving it in a pool of blood. Rock also attacked single women he met in parks or forests, killing them and burying their bodies. On one occasion, a woman was walking in a park with her young child when she met this sex fiend. The mother was killed and the child was abandoned. Rock was arrested on March 10, 1943, and secretly taken to Vienna, because Berlin was then being bombed by Allied aircraft. German doctors performed various experiments on the prisoner, such as castration. From the photos, the prisoner had an ape-like face, hideous and terrifying, which could indeed frighten women. The human demon died in Vienna on April 8, 1944.</p>

<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] The disturbance in this city caused by the vendor problem has returned to normal yesterday after Mayor Wu's broadcast the night before, sincerely explaining the situation. Starting in the morning, the shops reopened one after another, only the shops near the Huangpu and Laozha police stations, fearing accidents, opened later. The notice of emergency measures implemented by the Songhu Garrison Command was posted all over the streets after 8:00, which made people feel more at ease. However, the Nanshi Shiliupu and Fuyou Road vegetable markets were once attempted to be disrupted by unscrupulous elements, but were eventually dispersed by the police in time.</p>
<p>Director Fang of the Municipal Party Headquarters specially invited representatives of various people's organizations in the city to hold a meeting at 2:00 p.m. yesterday in the conference room of the Party Headquarters to discuss the aftermath measures for the disturbance caused by the vendor problem. Xiang Changquan of the Municipal Council, Feng Youzhen of the Journalists Association, Jiang Zhaowu of the Chamber of Commerce, Shui Xiangyun of the Trade Union, Zhou Feicheng of the Education Association, and representatives of the Youth League Branch, Local Association, Women's Association, Student Federation and other groups, as well as more than 30 news reporters attended. Director Fang first reported that the disturbance caused by the vendor problem has been suppressed by the military and police authorities with all their strength, and social order in the city has now returned to normal. However, Shanghai is the most important metropolis in the country, and public security must be reliably guaranteed. It is regrettable that this unfortunate incident occurred during the National Assembly in Beijing. Now that the situation has subsided, it is urgent to discuss appropriate measures for the aftermath. It is hoped that representatives of various groups will express their opinions as much as possible and discuss together. After the speech, Xiang Changquan, Secretary-General of the Municipal Council, reported on the Council's handling of the vendors' petition, and Xie Renzhao, Secretary-General of the Municipal Party Headquarters, reported on the resolutions of the Municipal Party Headquarters' temporary executive meeting on handling the incident. After the report, representatives of various groups expressed their opinions one after another, as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e77">Journalists Association Protests <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>Feng Youzhen, the representative of the Journalists Association, said that after this unfortunate incident occurred, several newspaper reporters were beaten by police officers while performing their duties. On behalf of the Journalists Association, I hereby protest to the police station. This incident was quickly suppressed by the Municipal Government and the military and police authorities, which is commendable. However, some unresolved issues that have arisen as a result must be resolved urgently. For example: (1) The vendor problem, it is hoped that the Municipal Government will find a reasonable solution as soon as possible; (2) It is hoped that the military and police authorities will take effective measures to maintain public security. For the rioters who took advantage of the vendor petition opportunity to disrupt public security and were arrested by the police station, it is hoped that the government will conduct a public trial; (3) For some innocent shops that were destroyed by the rioters, especially the Gaoshengda Paper Store, which suffered the most damage, people from all walks of life should show human sympathy and donate condolence money to help them.</p>
<h3 id="e78">Responsibility Must Be Investigated <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>Wang Zhaohu, the representative of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, said that many of the shops damaged by the rioters were members of the Chamber of Commerce. Today, one or two shops have appealed to the Chamber of Commerce for compensation for losses. The government should allocate relief funds to compensate them for their losses. As for whether the shops will accept the donations from all walks of life, it is not known, but it is out of the development of human sympathy, and the damaged shops can also obtain spiritual comfort. However, the aftermath of this incident must be dealt with in both the root and the branch. Compensation and assistance are only temporary solutions. The responsibility for causing this unfortunate incident must also be investigated. The Huangpu Branch Bureau's improper handling of the matter at the beginning cannot be completely excused. The business community is operating as usual today, showing its support for the government's maintenance of social order with its actions. However, it is also sincerely hoped that similar incidents will not happen again in the future.</p>

<p>Wang Hao of the Frontline Daily News put forward two points: (1) The military and police responsible for law enforcement should strictly abide by the law; (2) Request the government to provide effective protection for journalists to interview and publish news. After Wang's speech, Councilor Wang Xianqing arrived at the meeting. Director Fang immediately asked Wang to report on the process of being beaten after going to the Huangpu Branch Bureau on the 30th of last month on behalf of the Municipal Council to investigate the truth of the matter. Wang made a detailed report, proving that the police officers' actions at the time were indeed improper, and believed that the branch bureau should be responsible for the expansion of the situation. Later, Secretary Xie reported that the expansion of the situation was indeed due to someone taking the opportunity to incite the masses and disrupt public security, attempting to create a tragedy and a situation of terror. For example, the slogans shouted by the masses at the time included "The Kuomintang is creating the second May Thirtieth Massacre," which fully proves that it was not done by vendors or their families, but an organized and planned illegal act of violence with political motives. After Xie's report, Sun Dongcheng of Xinye Daily, Shui Xiangyun of the General Trade Union, Zhou Lianze of the Municipal Party Headquarters, and Zhou Feicheng of the Education Association expressed their opinions one after another. They all agreed that police discipline must be improved to prevent arbitrary beatings of the people. At the same time, the government's various policies should be carefully considered in advance for the impact they may cause, and implemented solemnly to avoid problems.</p>
<h3 id="e80">Director Fang Speaks His Views <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>After the representatives finished their speeches, Director Fang expressed his views, the main points being: (1) In banning vendors, the government did not do its best in publicity work in advance, and the Party Headquarters and party members did not do their best to assist in the publicity; (2) Arresting vendors and detaining them for many days, their families petitioning for their release was an inevitable result. The authorities should have planned in advance and sought appropriate solutions to avoid being used for rumors and incitement; (3) When the Huangpu Branch Bureau released the vendors, it should have released them in public when the masses were surrounding them, and announced it publicly to the masses. Then the vendors' families would have dispersed, and the ambitious rioters would have had no opportunity to take advantage of it; (4) When the masses surrounded and clamored, the police only fired blank shots to suppress them, which was indeed the greatest patience and is commendable. As for the expansion of the situation, it is obvious that the rioters took the opportunity to create a bloody tragedy and a situation of terror, in order to achieve their conspiracy to undermine public security and disrupt social order. Now that the incident has been resolved quickly and no bloody tragedy has occurred, it proves that the government and the military and police authorities are capable of maintaining public security, and the rioters' plan has completely failed. However, the public security problem in this city in the future still deserves the close attention, vigilance, and preparedness of all citizens and the municipal government and military and police agencies.</p>
<h3 id="e81">Drafted into Motions <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>Director Fang then summarized the opinions of the representatives and drafted six resolutions: (1) The government should immediately select appropriate, open places that do not hinder traffic and temporarily allow vendors to operate to maintain their livelihoods. Vendors should also pay attention to tidiness during business hours to maintain the appearance of the city. (2) The innocent victims among those detained this time should be released after investigation as soon as possible. The rioters who used the name of vendors to disrupt public security should be publicly tried separately as soon as possible. Those with solid evidence should be severely punished according to law to show the government's determination to eliminate violence and maintain public order. (3) The police station should return the vendors' belongings that it has collected as soon as possible. (4) The Party Headquarters, the government, and various groups in the city should extend the greatest sympathy to the shops destroyed by the rioters, especially the Gaoshengda Paper Store, which has meager capital, and donate condolence money. Innocent citizens who were injured by the rioters should also be comforted and relieved separately. (The condolence money will be collected by the Shanghai Central Daily.) (5) The Huangpu Branch Bureau should thoroughly investigate the incident. (6) As it is winter, the government and military and police agencies should pay close attention to winter defense to maintain public security. All were unanimously passed. The resolutions were sent to the Municipal Government for reference last night by the Municipal Party Headquarters.</p>
<h3 id="e82">More Than 30 Suspects Arrested <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>

<h3 id="e83">Small Disturbances in Nanshi <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] After the police station's notice yesterday morning, the shops in Shanghai resumed business as usual. However, there were still some unscrupulous people who gathered at Jiucang Street and Dajing Road in the city at about 10:00 yesterday morning, attempting to cause trouble again. They shouted along the way, ordering the shops to close. They then went to the Jiumudi vegetable market to intimidate the vegetable vendors to stop selling vegetables. The situation was quite chaotic at the time. The vegetable vendors fled, and many shops closed automatically, resulting in some broken glass windows. After receiving the report, the local Yiyi Branch Bureau Xiangxue Road Police Station sent police to suppress them and arrested suspects Jia Songlin, Han Changlin, Zhang Gouzi, Chen Benshan and others. One of them was holding a wooden stick. At the same time, six food stalls were overturned by a small group of people near Shiliupu Dama Road, and Zhang Zigen, Chen Konglang, Shan Jinmao, and Zhou Xianju were arrested on the spot. It was also learned that the Tangjiawan vegetable market was once disturbed at 10:00 yesterday morning. After the police rushed to the scene, the rioters dispersed and fled. Also, a congee stall in front of the Brothers Store in Laoximen was destroyed.</p>
<h3 id="e84">Director Fang of the Municipal Party Headquarters Visits Two Places Yesterday to Express Condolences <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>Fang, the director of the Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters, visited Director Du of the Huangpu Branch Bureau yesterday morning to inquire about the incident. At that time, the bureau was sorting out the vendors' goods and preparing to return them. Fang and Secretary Xie and Director Chen went to the affected businesses at 10:30 a.m. and first went to Gaoshengda Paper Store on Jinling East Road. The owner, Gao Chengxi, was not there at the time, and the manager, Lu Xuecheng, received them. Fang and others then went to the Daxin Company to express their condolences.</p>
<h3 id="e85">Police Attitude Should Be Improved; Spirit of Patience is Commendable; Mayor Wu Expresses His Thoughts Yesterday; Hopes that Industry and Commerce Circles Will Work Together to Prevent Disturbances <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] Regarding the disturbance, Mayor Wu expressed his thoughts yesterday, believing that the police's attitude towards citizens must be improved, and expressed his commendation for the military and police's spirit of patience in this incident. The main points are: (1) Regarding the problem of banning vendors, the authorities are extremely cautious. The disturbance caused by this incident was purely an attempt by conspiratorial rioters to create a tragedy. Those responsible for public security have put in painstaking efforts to handle it. The conspirators' actions on Saturday night in the downtown area of ​​the central district, such as destroying shops and disrupting traffic, were completely aimed at expanding the situation, forcing strikes and market closures, in order to achieve their goal of inciting and creating a policy of terror. I ordered the military and police at the time to absolutely not allow them to open fire, so in the absence of any other options, only blank wooden shells were fired. I express my commendation for the military and police's spirit of patience. (2) The purpose of the Municipal Government's banning of vendors in the Huangpu and Laozha districts is to maintain traffic in the downtown area. This measure is not wrong, and the vendors were given a period of five months to relocate their businesses and find other livelihoods, fully demonstrating that the government has taken into account the vendors' livelihoods. The rumors that the detained vendors died of starvation and freezing are not true. However, some junior staff members in the police station who served during the Concession period and were retained after screening may inevitably spread old habits. The attitude towards citizens will be improved in the future. I will put forward a warning at the municipal meeting that all government officials and staff in all bureaus should maintain the spirit that civil servants are public servants of the citizens and should serve the citizens. Finally, it was said that the disturbance had come to an end by the afternoon before yesterday. Yesterday morning, the police stations sent police to persuade the shops to resume business as usual. At around 9:00, the city's order was completely restored to normal. However, the conspirators who caused the trouble still exist. Whether in the industrial, commercial, or academic circles, they all need to have a clear understanding and work together with the government to prevent disturbances in order to achieve the goal of stabilizing social order.</p>

<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] Among those injured by stray bullets in the vendor incident in the previous days, there are three more: (1) Jia Shoukai, 24 years old, a leatherworker, living at 28 Dangchun Lane, Jiumudi.

<p>[Our Dispatch] The other day, rioters took advantage of the vendor incident to create disturbances and destroy shops. Yesterday, our reporter visited 27 affected shops (including department stores, theaters, hotels, inns, dance halls, pharmacies, and fruit stores) to investigate the extent of the damage. A total of 197 pieces of glass of various sizes were destroyed, totaling 230 million yuan. Adding in the scattered losses of goods, the 200 million yuan worth of inventory burned at Gao Sheng, and the uninvestigated damaged shops, the direct losses caused by this unfortunate incident are over 500 million legal tender. As for various indirect losses, including the business losses suffered by shops throughout the city, that number is too large to estimate.</p>
<p>A large fresh fruit store on Henan South Road, which had just opened on December 1st and had barely made a few easy sales, was suddenly flooded with customers who didn't pay, grabbing oranges, apples, and pears and stuffing them into bags. Suddenly, a shout of "Fight!" erupted, the pot for roasting chestnuts was smashed, the scale was flattened, and the neon lights, mirror frames, and eight glass windows were all broken. The shop assistants rushed to put up the wooden door panels, but despite their quick efforts, one of the panels went missing. At this time, the Lao Wanxin restaurant, which hadn't closed yet diagonally across the street, also became a target of the rioters. The pot for frying dumplings was thrown into the middle of the road, and white chicken, roast duck, and marinated goods were all discarded. The losses for both businesses are estimated to be around 2 million yuan.</p>
<p>The Bo'ai Pharmacy on Huanghe Road also had its grand opening on the first. Around 3 PM, while many ladies were purchasing cosmetics and tonics, hundreds of rioters suddenly swarmed in, smashing four glass windows, eight neon lights, and many liquid medicines in the display cases. Many of the flower baskets displayed at the entrance became weapons for the rioters, and the total loss amounted to 20 million yuan.</p>
<p>Other shops were mostly destroyed by various types of glass: showcase glass, door glass, signboard glass, and small window glass. These glasses included British, German, and American products. The largest glass cost more than 8 million yuan per piece, and the smallest cost more than 10,000 yuan.</p>

<h3 id="e89">Inciters of the Disturbance: Bad Elements to be Dealt with According to Martial Law; Director Xuan Talks About Aftermath Issues <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Yesterday morning around 9 AM, Police Chief Xuan Tiewu patrolled in plain clothes to inspect the city's security situation and listened to reports from various police stations. Xuan first went to the Huangpu Precinct, the location of the incident, and then went to the Taishan, Xincheng, and Lao Zha Precincts, expressing satisfaction with the security measures in each district. Around 10 AM, our reporter met Director Guan at the Lao Zha Precinct, who replied to inquiries, saying: "The suspected criminals arrested during this disturbance are currently under strict investigation. All bad elements who incite the disturbance and engage in arson and chaos, once verified, will be dealt with according to martial law. If it is clearly verified that they were innocently implicated, they will be released on bail. As for those injured by gunfire in the incident who are indeed poor and helpless, they have been sent to public hospitals for treatment, and their medical expenses will be borne by the municipal government until they recover. However, those bad elements who took the opportunity to cause trouble and create chaos, even their deaths would not be regrettable." Director Xuan ended by stating that the city's security, with its strong military and police forces, can be absolutely relied upon. He sincerely hopes that citizens will live and work in peace, and not disturb each other.</p>
<h3 id="e90">Three Points of View from Vendors; More Than Ten Representatives Go to the City Council to Present Their Case <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] More than ten vendor representatives, including Bao Guizhi and Liu Huashan, went to the City Council yesterday morning and afternoon in separate groups to verbally present their opinions on the aftermath. Summarized below: (1) They will abide by the city government's regulations and find public or private open spaces in the Huangpu and Lao Zha districts to conduct business in a centralized manner. (2) Before suitable locations are found, they request the city government to consider the vendors' livelihoods and inform the police department to temporarily suspend enforcement. (3) They request the police department to return the confiscated stalls and goods. Secretary-General Xiang replied that the first and third points were considered reasonable and would be forwarded to the city government and police department for adoption. However, the point about postponing enforcement would need to be discussed with the city government before a response could be given. Furthermore, because the representatives only made verbal presentations temporarily, fearing that they might not represent the opinions of all vendors, they were instructed to consult with the vendors and then submit a written statement to the council for referral to the city government for handling.</p>
<h3 id="e91">Glass Prices Soar <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>Most of the broken glass has not yet been replaced. Because glass prices are extremely high, they have been soaring in the past couple of days. Glass that cost more than 1 million yuan a piece before has risen to more than 4 million yuan yesterday. It is said that prices will rise further tomorrow, and even more the day after.</p>
<p>Most shop owners have reported to the police station, awaiting the authorities' disposition. However, the glass windows of Xinxin Company were insured, but the insurance company said that they are not responsible for compensating for damage caused by rioters. The two sides are still in negotiations.</p>
<p>This storm has passed, but how much more vigilant should we be in preventing it in the future!</p>
<h3 id="e92">Foreigners Incur Few Losses <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] In the major disturbances caused by the detention of street vendors the other day, except for a few foreign-owned cars having their windows smashed by stones and a US Information Service jeep being destroyed, there have been no serious losses for foreigners. Our reporter visited the consulates of the United Kingdom and the United States in Shanghai and was told by their spokesmen that no expatriates had come to complain of losses. As for the American military, they ordered soldiers not to leave their barracks on the day of the incident, so they were also safe.</p>
<h3 id="e93">City Government and Police Department Send Representatives to Console Injured Reporters; Errant Police Officers to be Severely Punished <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Since this disturbance occurred, Mayor Wu and Director Xuan have deeply apologized and expressed regret for the shock and unease suffered by citizens and the disturbance to the local area. In addition to Mayor Wu summoning Gao Chengxi, the owner of Gao Sheng Jianzhi Stationery Store, for condolences yesterday morning, he also sent Ouyang Zunquan, the Chief of General Affairs of the City Government, as his representative at 6 PM, and Director Xuan sent Fang Zhichao, the Chief of Administrative Affairs of the Police Department, as his representative to various newspaper offices to express condolences to the beaten reporters. Today, they will continue to express condolences to the city councilors who were beaten and insulted during the mediation, and then express condolences to the stores of the various affected companies.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the two representatives from the City Government and Police Department first went to the Wenhui News to express condolences to reporter Li Houcheng, who was injured in the face by a police officer that day. Li happened to be out, so Director Fang and others left their cards and passed on their words. They then went to the Lao Zha Precinct to investigate the damaged stores for reference. Afterwards, they went to the Ta Kung Pao to express condolences to reporter Chen Tianci, and then to the Zhengyan News to express condolences to the newspaper's photographers Zhang Huchen and reporters Wang Yanlang and Yang Shiji. Because this newspaper's reporters suffered the most beatings, Fang and others specially asked Wang and Zhang to describe the situation in detail, which Director Fang personally recorded. Fang also said that Mayor Wu and Director Xuan were very angry when they heard that the reporters had been beaten, believing that newspaper reporters uphold justice for the people, and their duties are noble, but the police officers dared to despise them, which was absurd. The two police officers who beat the reporters at the time, numbers 4726 and 4144, will be severely punished. As for the duty officer who participated in the insult, their name will also be investigated, and Li, the section chief of the Huangpu Precinct, who was present and turned a blind eye, will be thoroughly investigated and dealt with one by one.</p>
<p>Director Ouyang and others then went to the United Evening News to express condolences to reporter Yao Fangzao, and finally to the Freedom Forum News to express condolences to reporter Wu Dong, all expressing apologies on behalf of Mayor Wu and Director Xuan.</p>

<p>The 12th National Representative Conference convened by the National Christian Council of China, after more than a year of active preparation, is scheduled to hold a grand opening ceremony at the International Social Hall on Hengshan Road in Shanghai at 2 PM this afternoon.

<h3 id="e95">Year-End Approaching, Labor Disputes Increase; Workers Demand Year-End Bonuses; Disputes Awaiting Resolution; Zhao Banfu Says No Legal Basis <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] As the year-end approaches, labor disputes in the city's industrial sector are increasing daily. As far as the reporter knows, the following cases have been submitted to the Social Affairs Bureau for mediation:</p>
<p>(1) China Tobacco Factory: The workers initially demanded a year-end bonus of 2 million yuan, which was rejected by the management, leading to a strike. Later, the Social Affairs Bureau gave the workers 24 hours to resume work before discussing the year-end bonus. The workers have now resumed work in compliance with the order, but their morale is low. The matter is scheduled for mediation at the Social Affairs Bureau tomorrow. The factory is adamant about not accepting the demand, but hopes to find a reasonable solution under the auspices of the bureau.</p>
<p>(2) Sullivan Confectionery and Biscuit Factory: Workers also demanded improved treatment, with the following specific requests: (1) An additional 150,000 yuan per person per month for living expenses. (2) An additional three months' year-end bonus for this month. (3) A reward of four working days for those who do not stop work each month. (4) Payment of five days of pre-war accumulated working days. (5) Double pay for work on public holidays. (6) The factory should provide one meal per day. This matter was submitted to the Social Affairs Bureau for mediation on the 29th of last month, and has not yet been resolved.</p>
<p>(3) Huayi Wool Textile and Dyeing Factory: Workers demanded higher wages and improved welfare, with the following specific conditions: (1) Wages: The current highest wage is 100,000 yuan per month, with the average being around 50,000 yuan; they now demand that it be raised to a maximum of 200,000 yuan, with the average being around 150,000 yuan. (2) Wages should be paid for weekly holidays and national commemorative days. (3) In the event of a power outage, wage payments should be implemented in accordance with the methods promulgated by the Labor-Management Assessment Committee. (4) The treatment of female workers during maternity leave should be handled in accordance with the Factory Law. (5) If a worker is injured on the job, the factory should be responsible for medical expenses, and wages should also be paid. (6) Workers and workers' representatives should not be dismissed without cause. (7) The daily working hours are stipulated to be ten hours, and overtime should be compensated proportionally. This dispute occurred on October 18th. Yesterday, representatives from both labor and management negotiated at the Social Affairs Bureau, but no agreement was reached on the issue of raising wages.</p>
<p>(4) American Texaco Petroleum Company: Employees jointly requested the factory to improve treatment, and the content of the conditions was quite broad. The main points are as follows: (1) Due to the rising cost of living, it is requested that the base salary of employees be increased by 50% uniformly. (2) The base salary of employees below 100 yuan should be calculated according to the workers' cost of living index; those above 100 yuan should be paid according to the staff's cost of living index. (3) Double salary will be paid for one month during the Lunar New Year this year. (4) Daily working hours are limited to eight hours, and overtime should be paid double. (5) Employees, regardless of Chinese or foreign nationality, should be treated equally according to their grade in order to demonstrate impartiality. (6) If an employee is sick, the company should bear the medical expenses. (7) When an employee retires due to old age or illness, the company should pay a lump-sum retirement pension and old-age pension. (8) The company cannot dismiss employees without cause. (9) The company should build employee dormitories. (10) Kerosene should be distributed once a month uniformly. (11) Any worker who has served for three months should be considered a permanent employee. This matter was submitted to the Social Affairs Bureau for mediation on October 23rd. Texaco Company has sent a written reply to the bureau regarding the various conditions of the labor side; it agreed to handle the salary improvement request after investigating the cost of living; it agreed to handle the improvement of employee welfare as appropriate; as for the request to pay retirement pension and old-age pension, it said that it needed to discuss it with the company's directors before it could reply. Some points are vaguely worded and not affirmative, and the resolution is still pending.</p>
<p>(5) Racecourse: The workers yesterday bitterly complained to the Social Affairs Bureau about the Westerners' arrogant and bad attitude. Their specific demands are as follows: (1) Wages should be calculated according to the cost of living index and paid in three grades: Grade A is 55 yuan, Grade B is 51 yuan, and Grade C is 45 yuan. (2) The new treatment standard should be implemented from October. (3) Workers and workers' representatives shall not be dismissed on false pretenses. (4) Workers should have retirement pay. Those who have served for three years should receive six months' retirement pay; those who have served for five years, ten months; those who have served for ten years, one year; if the dismissal is proposed by the management, the retirement pay should be doubled. (5) If a worker is sick, the medical expenses should be borne by the management, and wages should not be deducted during the sick leave period. When a worker is sick, he/she may borrow three months' salary from the management. (6) The cost of workers' welfare facilities should be borne equally by both labor and management. (7) When the management hires new people, they should first hire unemployed workers from the labor union. (8) Employees should be paid double salary at the end of the year. This matter is still under the mediation of the Social Affairs Bureau, and the resolution is pending.</p>
<p>(6) Dagong Dyeing and Weaving Factory previously cancelled the repair department and laid off 31 workers, causing a labor-management conflict. After mediation by the Social Affairs Bureau, each laid-off worker was paid one month's severance pay and one and a half months' travel expenses, which was resolved.</p>
<p>(7) It is heard that the workers of the Central Printing Factory demanded the payment of year-end bonuses, but they have not yet submitted a request to the Social Affairs Bureau for mediation.</p>
<p>Director Zhao Banfu of the Social Affairs Bureau emphasized that the bureau is making the workers thoroughly understand that there is no legal basis for year-end bonuses, and that it is entirely a matter of pleading. If the factory has profits, can it be forced to uniformly issue a fixed amount of year-end bonuses? Furthermore, interfering with the factory's right to employ people is even more inappropriate. The Social Affairs Bureau's handling of this matter will be based on the principle of "labor and management co-existence," without oppressing the labor side, but also without forcing the factory to close down. The Social Affairs Bureau's policy for mediating labor disputes over the past year has been to promote labor-management cooperation, which is the only way out for China's industry.</p>
<p>Also, a reporter met a union official yesterday, who said: The "Machinist Research Society" organized by machinists in the city's machinery industry has decided to demand the payment of six months' year-end bonuses. The workers' attitude towards year-end bonuses is that they want more if the management earns more, and less if the management earns less, and they have no intention of forcing the factory to collapse.</p>

<h3 id="e98">A Hundred-Year-Old Store Passed Down Through Four Generations: Gao Sheng's Paper Shop Presents a Grim Sight; Doors Nailed Shut with Wooden Boards: Temporarily Closed; Mayor Visits the Owner and Donates One Million <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>[Our Special Report] Gao Sheng Jianzhi Printing Shop, passed down through four generations and founded ninety-nine years ago, has unfortunately and innocently suffered repeated looting by rioters. All the equipment for making money was burned or destroyed, and even the clothes and bedding were looted. The total loss is more than 200 million. The second time rioters ran rampant the other day, even though the small shop owner kowtowed hundreds of times and pleaded bitterly, he not only failed to receive any sympathy from the rioters, but they even wanted to throw him into the fire to burn him. Fortunately, the shop assistants managed to pull him away and hide him, thus avoiding disaster.</p>
<p>Everywhere are Glass Shards. Yesterday afternoon, our reporter stepped on the paper scraps and went to the second floor of Gao Sheng's shop. In a small room, all the glass windows were riddled with holes. There, we met their business director, Lv Xuecheng. The old owner, Gao Chengxi, was out on business. The landlady, with red eyes and disheveled hair, sat on the edge of the bed, wiping away tears. At this time, the small shop owner Gao Pengyun (see picture) also came to tell the reporter the detailed story. Gao Pengyun is a fifth-year student at Tongde Medical College and is also an intern at Renji Hospital. He is the fourth-generation owner of Gao Sheng's shop and the one who kowtowed and pleaded with the rioters.</p>
<p>According to the victim's report, the details are as follows: At 11 AM on the 30th of last month, Lv Xuecheng and others saw a group of hooligan-like men in their twenties shouting at the entrance of the store: "To expand the matter, we must first cut off traffic." So, this group of people went to the nearby Zhonghua Alley and moved a few large stones onto the tram tracks. After a tram driver negotiated with them for a long time, they let him pass, but the following trams were not allowed to pass, and the order became more and more chaotic. The police drove a jeep to interfere, but were pelted with stones, and the situation escalated immediately. Gao Sheng, seeing the tense situation, put up all the door panels after 3 PM. Around 6 PM, just as they were preparing to eat dinner, they heard someone shouting below: "You poured boiling water on my head, that's outrageous! Hit, hit, hit!" Then, many people followed suit and shouted "Hit, hit, hit," thus causing a catastrophe. The reporter asked, "Did you actually pour water?" But the shop owner and shop assistants firmly denied it, saying that only the water pipe on the eaves was damaged, and the accumulated rainwater kept dripping down, and after the glass windows were broken by stones, the broken glass shards fell down and injured people's heads.</p>
<p>Get Out Quickly and Set Fire Immediately. After Gao Dasheng's door panel was broken through, Lv Xuecheng saw a person in uniform leading the way in. At first, he thought it was someone sent by the authorities to suppress the situation, but when he heard him ask aggressively what kind of person he was, and after being told that he was a worker in the shop, this person posing as a soldier said: "Get out quickly, and set fire immediately." The people who came with him even said they wanted to throw "Longjiao" (i.e., Lv Xuecheng) out of the window. Fortunately, someone nearby jokingly let him go. The landlady firmly refused to leave, and finally retreated. At this time, the boss was drinking at someone's house.</p>
<p>Groups of rioters threw the shop's account books, stationery, and lead type out into the street and burned them in piles. The machines and printing rooms were destroyed, and even the workers' quilts were looted. It stopped at 11 PM that night. Workers guarded the shop that night, and the police station sent four police officers to patrol at night, and finally only one person was left to guard. The remaining door panels were still propped up haphazardly.</p>
<p>The day before yesterday morning, Gao Sheng spent 110,000 yuan on labor costs (excluding bamboo fences and no compensation) to build the fence. Unfortunately, at 3:30 PM, a gust of wind brought rioters driving a truck to the scene. The truck was full of young people, and the leader wore a leather-collared short coat. As soon as the truck stopped, he directed them to dismantle the fence, shouting: "They actually built a fence, tear it down, burn, burn, burn!"</p>
<p>Small Boss Kneels and Almost Gets Burned Alive. At this time, all the people in the shop were hiding in the attic on the second floor. A large group of rioters rushed straight up and set all the books and account books on fire. The small shop owner, seeing them rush to the second floor, in order to protect the property on the second floor, repeatedly kowtowed to them, begging them not to destroy the second floor, and that they could destroy the storefront. At first, some people spared him and temporarily stopped. By the evening, there were more and more people, and the small shop owner kowtowed outside the door again, but no matter what, he could not move the hearts of the rioters. Instead, they said that he had been a military officer and wanted to throw him into the fire to burn him. The shop assistants became anxious and hurriedly pulled him away, telling him not to beg anymore, thus avoiding disaster. As a result, all eight printing presses were destroyed, the paper cutter was moved to the road to cut iron bars, and 4,000 pounds of lead type flew all over the street. People who took advantage of the fire to loot filled their bags with things they liked and left the scene. The heavy things were smashed and thrown around. One chartered car and one bicycle also became remnants of the fire. The bedding rolls were loaded into three tricycles and taken away. When the police came to interfere, the firefighters came to put out the fire several times, but were prevented from doing so.</p>
<p>Regarding the aftermath, the boss was so anxious that he had no way out. He could only clean up and prepare to nail up the wooden boards on the door and temporarily close the business. On one hand, he asked the Paper Industry Association to appeal to the City Chamber of Commerce. Mayor Wu summoned Gao Chengxi at 10 AM yesterday, expressing his deep apologies that the municipal authorities had failed to provide adequate protection, because the order was chaotic at the time and the police officers could not arbitrarily suppress it. He hoped that he would understand the situation, and the losses suffered would definitely be compensated in the future. He also donated 1 million in his personal name to provide comfort. Director Fang also went to express his condolences, saying: He was ordered by the Chairman to return and express condolences to all sectors of society, and will hold a fundraising event to compensate the shop for its losses.</p>
<p>As the reporter was about to leave, he heard the last few heartfelt words of the small shop owner, "We who run paper shops rely entirely on the sale of year-end account books. Our winter account books are all made in the summer. Now all the finished products have been burned, and even if we want to make them, it's too late!"</p>

<h3 id="e99">The Abbot of Jing'an Temple Fights to Attend Court Hearings: De Wu and Mi Jia's Suspected Treason Case Heard Again Yesterday Afternoon; Five Teachers' Testimonies Divided into Two Factions <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The case of Jing'an Temple Abbot De Wu and Supervising Monk Mi Jia, suspected of being traitors, was heard again yesterday afternoon in the High Court.  Five witnesses were summoned: Li Haoran, Gu Longche, Xu Honghan, Yao Shaoxiu, and Chen Zhixin, all former teachers at Jing'an Elementary School.  The two defendants were also brought in for questioning.  Many monks from Jing'an Temple attended the hearing. The first two witnesses' testimonies were favorable to the defendants, while the latter three were unfavorable. The testimonies were completely contradictory. The hearing lasted from 3:00 PM to 5:30 PM, after which presiding judge Yang Dingyu announced a postponement for further questioning. The defendants were returned to custody.</p>
<p>Li Haoran stated that he began teaching at Jing'an Elementary School in August of the 32nd year of the Republic [1943] and resigned in May of the 34th year of the Republic [1945]. The school was not run by Jing'an Temple but by a board of directors. The land for the school was donated by Jing'an Temple. Mi Jia served as a standing director, and De Wu was a director. Tong Peng Japanese Language School was founded in the 31st year of the Republic [1942] and closed in April or May of the 34th year of the Republic [1945]. At the time, someone "with great power" wanted to take over Jing'an Elementary School. After much negotiation, it was agreed to lend classrooms to open a Japanese language night school. He did not know if the school was run by the enemy's Asia Development Board (興亞院). However, the wooden sign indicated that it was sponsored by the Japanese Higashi Honganji Temple (東本願寺). De Wu and Mi Jia did not teach classes. The principal was a Japanese man named Kinoshita Man'asen, but he did not come often. The school was separated from Jing'an Temple by a wall, with a small door that could be used for passage, but it was not often open. As for other matters, such as memorial services held by Jing'an Temple, because he was a Catholic, he did not usually concern himself with them, so he did not know the details.</p>
<p>Gu Longzhang stated that he taught at Jing'an Elementary School from August of the 32nd year of the Republic [1943] to August of the 34th year of the Republic [1945]. The school was originally attached to the temple, but later the temple donated land to build its own school building. Both De Wu and Mi Jia were directors. The recruitment advertisements, diplomas, and wooden signs for Tong Peng Japanese Language School claimed that it was run by Higashi Honganji Temple. Mi Jia and De Wu were not directors of the Japanese language school. When asked about the two defendants' interactions with Japanese people and the Jing'an Temple's hosting of ceremonies, Gu replied that he did not know.</p>
<p>Xu Honghan stated that he served as the director of administrative affairs and a teacher at Jing'an Elementary School for a total of seventeen years, resigning at the end of July last year. Mi Jia and De Wu only used Japanese influence to become directors of Jing'an Elementary School after the Pacific War, in November of the 32nd year of the Republic [1943]. Tong Peng Japanese Language School was jointly run by Higashi Honganji Temple and Jing'an Temple. In April of the 31st year of the Republic [1942], they forcibly borrowed elementary school classrooms, with a Japanese monk serving as principal. Water and electricity were used from Jing'an Elementary School, but the expenses were paid by Jing'an Temple. Mi Jia and De Wu often inspected the school and gave speeches at the beginning and end of the school year. The teachers were all Japanese. The recruitment advertisements stated that the school was registered with the Japanese Embassy, and so on. After speaking, he presented to the court the 8th session recruitment advertisement for the Japanese language night school brought by the accuser, Xie Xiqing. The advertisement was about five feet tall and consisted of two boards. On the back of one of them was a notice stating "Japanese Meiji Day - Holiday for One Day."</p>
<p>Yao Shaoxiu stated that from February of the 22nd year of the Republic [1933] to the end of July of the 34th year of the Republic [1945], he served as the head of general affairs and a teacher at Jing'an Elementary School. Before the War of Resistance, there was no board of directors. After the Pacific War, Mi Jia and De Wu relied on enemy puppet forces and insisted on joining the board of directors, becoming directors in November of the 32nd year of the Republic [1943]. Before entering Jing'an Temple, Mi Jia presided over Xizhu Temple (西竺寺) in Hongkou and had close ties with Higashi Honganji Temple, using this influence to enter Jing'an Temple and establish the Japanese language school. In April of the 31st year of the Republic [1942], De Wu and Mi Jia, along with Japanese monks from Higashi Honganji Temple, personnel from the Asia Development Board's military police unit, and Japanese police chief Sugisaki from the puppet Jing'an Temple police station, as well as chief of the Baojia (保甲) system Sakiya, forcibly occupied Jing'an Elementary School. After this, although nominally it was called a joint operation between the temples, it was actually managed by De Wu and Mi Jia. Principal Zhifeng was just a puppet, only coming once at the time of the founding in June of the 31st year of the Republic [1942]. At the opening ceremony, Zhifeng spoke first, followed by Mi Jia and De Wu. Mi Jia gave a detailed account of the meaning of the founding, saying that he wanted to integrate the ideas of China, Japan, and Manchuria and promote cultural exchange. De Wu said: Shanghai can be so stable today entirely thanks to the Japanese. If you learn Japanese well, you can be introduced to work in Japanese agencies. In addition, Jing'an Temple held Buddhist lectures, and Chen Binhe was invited to speak. I can vouch for my words, and if I am falsely accusing them, I can be prosecuted. He also presented two pieces of evidence.</p>
<p>Chen Zhixin stated that he taught at Jing'an Elementary School and served as the director of student affairs for a period of time from the start of the war in the 26th year of the Republic [1937] until February of the 32nd year of the Republic [1943]. On a certain day in April of the 31st year of the Republic [1942], Mi Jia came with Japanese people to forcibly occupy the school. Although the principal on the graduation diplomas of the Japanese language night school was Zhifeng, Mi Jia was actually in charge, and De Wu was just a puppet. The small door between Jing'an Temple and Jing'an Elementary School was only opened after the establishment of the Tong Peng Japanese Language School. Mi Jia not only lectured at Tong Peng, but also came to Jing'an Elementary School to lecture, talking about how "the Greater East Asia War" was something or other. He was really angry and couldn't take it anymore. He spoke with great agitation.</p>
<p>Defendants' Statements</p>
<p>After the five witnesses were questioned, Judge Yang ordered De Wu and Mi Jia to be brought in. De Wu, dressed in a gray cloth monk's robe and looking thin, responded to the two Japanese language school recruitment signs presented by the accuser, saying: If they want to sue me, they can write it themselves. There is absolutely no such thing as providing all the funds for Tong Peng. The small door between Jing'an Temple and Jing'an Elementary School was already open before the Tong Peng Japanese Language School was established. Mi Jia, dressed in a black monk's robe, argued: I never participated in Tong Peng in any capacity. The recruitment advertisements mentioned by the accuser could be written on paper and are not sufficient evidence. Jing'an Temple only subsidized the elementary school's expenses and did not subsidize the Japanese language school's expenses. "If you want to condemn someone, you can always find a charge." The law must focus on facts. Xu, Yao, and Chen are giving false testimonies because of a grudge. Please also consider the opinions of the first two witnesses. One of the accusers, Buddhist monk Yang Xi, said during the enemy puppet period that we were Chongqing elements, and as a result, we were all detained by the enemy military police. After the victory, they said we were traitors. Recently, I heard that Liu Gen and others wanted to forcibly enter Jing'an Temple, so the accusation is false, and it's just a fight over property.</p>
<p>Request for Bail</p>
<p>The defendants' defense lawyer refuted the evidence presented by the three witnesses who were unfavorable to the defendants, saying that it was clearly false testimony. Furthermore, because the management of Jing'an Temple is currently in disarray and there is no one to preside over it, he requested that the court still grant bail. Mi Jia also said: I have absolutely no intention of escaping. The court ordered a written application to be submitted and stated that it would be decided by the collegial panel of the court. The defendants were still remanded in custody. By the time the court adjourned, all the lights were on in the city.</p>

<h3 id="e100">Puppet Secret Agent Robs U.S. Dollars: District Court Tries Enemy Puppet Unresolved Case <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The District Court yesterday tried a case of a puppet secret agent robbing U.S. dollars and making threats before the victory. In the autumn of the 34th year of the Republic [1945], two Jewish men, Hadmon and Spiro, secretly bought and sold U.S. dollars. At that time, the Japanese army strictly controlled U.S. dollars and legal tender. Therefore, two puppet secret agents surnamed Chen and Fan entrusted a coal briquette shop owner named Wu Qixian to falsely tell the Jewish men that they wanted to buy 200 U.S. dollars, and said that they would lead them to get the money. They lured them to the intersection of Huoshan Road and Dasuwan Road, where Chen and Fan stepped forward and confiscated the U.S. dollars. They then went to Spiro's house to search and seized more than 280 U.S. dollars and more than 800,000 puppet Central Reserve Bank notes (偽中儲券). Afterwards, Ha and Si reported the matter to the puppet court. However, the puppet court delayed the trial. It was not until yesterday that the District Court held its first hearing. Because so much time had passed, it was necessary to collect more evidence, and the court ordered a postponement for further trial on December 11.</p>
<h3 id="e101">Li Ze Case to be Retried Tomorrow: Accusers Publish Open Letter and Submit Another Complaint <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Li Ze, the general manager of Xinxin Company (新新公司), was accused of treason by employees of the company, including Shu Yueqiao, after the victory. The High Court of this city concluded the trial and sentenced him to three years of imprisonment. The defendant disagreed with the verdict and his wife, Li Liu Zhaoxing, filed a petition with the Supreme Court in Nanjing, requesting a retrial. The court ruled that the original verdict was inappropriate and remanded the case for a new trial. The High Court of this city has now scheduled a retrial for tomorrow afternoon.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court's reasons for remanding the case for a new trial were: (1) Regarding the hiring of Japanese nationals Ito Masamitsu and Kinoshita Yutaka as consultants, the original verdict did not explain whether the defendant had contacted the enemy army, whether the consultants were entrusted to handle matters, what the facts and content were, and whether he admitted to colluding with the enemy with intentions detrimental to the country, which was an oversight. (2) The original verdict did not implement the investigation procedures in accordance with the law, did not read the verdict to the defendant, did not inform him of the main points, and did not ask him for his opinions, thus depriving the defendant of the opportunity to defend himself. (3) The original verdict did not explain the basis for citing the wartime economic regulations promulgated by the puppet Nanjing government, the provisional regulations of the puppet General Chamber of Commerce, and the China-Japan Joint Declaration. The defendant was unaware of these matters beforehand and could not use them as a basis for defense.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the accusers in the Li Ze case, Shu Yueqiao, Han Wucheng, Ye Qiubin, Xu Kekang, and others, considering that Li Ze would be retried by the Second Criminal Division of the High Court tomorrow, specifically invited the press to the Xinxin Company Colleagues' Association at 16 Fengji Lane at 2:00 PM yesterday afternoon, and published an open letter to the National Assembly representatives and the Municipal Council, listing Li Ze's crimes and emphasizing that he had contributed more than 20,000 catties of iron to support the enemy, requesting that they uphold justice. The letter was sent out last night. It is also understood that Shu Yueqiao, Han Wucheng, and others have asked lawyer Sha Qianli to draft a complaint, which will be personally presented to Judge Yang Ding at the opening of the trial as evidence.</p>

<p>The second general meeting of members of the Association of Comrades Who Suffered in the War in this city was held at the Jindu Grand Theater the day before yesterday. The situation was enthusiastic. It was originally planned to elect directors and supervisors on the spot, but due to time constraints, the ballots could not be counted. It is now scheduled to count the ballots at 11:00 AM today at the association's headquarters at 557 Hedde Road. In addition to appointing member representatives to supervise the ballots, count the ballots, and write the ballots, all members are free to participate. Furthermore, the association's presentation of commemorative medals for martyrs who died for their country, on behalf of all sectors of Shanghai to commemorate the July 7th Incident, has also begun.

<p>The Municipal Council's second joint meeting made several resolutions to improve the operations of the distribution office. This reporter specifically visited the person in charge of the office. According to him: He is very grateful for the instructions from the Municipal Council and stated: (1) 1,500 sets of uniforms have already been made and distributed. The remaining 300 or so sets can be completed and distributed this week. There is no such thing as not making them. Regarding the Municipal Government's General Affairs Department entrusting a business to produce 3,000 sets of Melton wool uniforms from the U.S., the goods have not arrived due to a strike by dockworkers in the U.S., or this is a misunderstanding. (2) Military blankets will be allocated by the office for distribution as soon as the Supply Bureau decides on the method. (3) It is hoped that domestic goods manufacturers will supply as many affordable daily necessities as possible for distribution. (4) Procedures will be simplified, and it will be possible to pay for goods and receive them immediately. Also, the next items to be distributed may be military blankets.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper] The O'Hara Bureau spy case has now reached the stage of investigating activities in Guangzhou. Yesterday, the witness who testified was Brillisson, the former secretary of the German Consulate in Guangzhou. This person's words were evasive, and he repeatedly avoided answering questions directly, causing prosecutor Major Duval to become agitated and repeatedly question him sternly. Later, the court warned Brillisson that he must be responsible for his testimony, and the atmosphere in the courtroom eased. Lawyer Yang Linzhi was still not in court yesterday. According to French lawyer Prime, the Japanese witness Nakagawa, who was detained a few days ago, was released that afternoon, so he continued to serve as defense counsel the next day. As for lawyer Yang, he may not appear in court again for other reasons.</p>
<p>Furthermore, after the Guangzhou witnesses in this case have been questioned, there are still more than a dozen witnesses from Beijing to testify, so the entire case will take at least three more weeks to conclude.</p>

<p>The China Merchants Electric Company's generators were completely dismantled and destroyed by the enemy during the war. Since the victory, the company's power supply has been entirely dependent on the Shanghai Electric Power Company, which has resulted in a heavy burden on the power company. The Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities has repeatedly urged the China Merchants Company to generate its own electricity to alleviate the power shortage. It is now learned that the company has leased a 1,440-kilowatt power generation equipment from the Shanghai Cement Company and signed a lease agreement on November 9th. It is understood that the Bureau of Public Utilities has ordered the China Merchants Company to complete the installation by mid-December and restore its own power generation.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper] On November 29th, the Changning District Police Station of this city accepted a complaint from citizen Chen Ziju. According to his report, his friend Sun Pingjiang borrowed 10 million Legal Tender (法幣) from him on September 2nd, with a term of half a month, and issued a check from the Central Trust of China Bank (中匯銀行) dated September 17th. Shortly after, he borrowed another 10 million Legal Tender with a check from Juxingcheng Bank (聚興誠銀行) under the name of a Mr. Liu. On September 3rd, he borrowed another 40 million Legal Tender, and pledged 146 taels of gold and a factory at 1107 Kangding Road as collateral, with a written mortgage agreement. On September 16th, Sun went to Chen's father's place with a 10 million Central Trust of China Bank check under his own name and exchanged it for the Juxingcheng Bank check. However, all the checks were returned when due, and after several unsuccessful negotiations with Sun, he refused to settle the matter for a month. On the 29th of last month, Sun even denied that he had issued a mortgage agreement or borrowed money. The police station, considering that Sun Pingjiang had paid Chen Ziju 6 million Legal Tender in interest, indicating that a debt relationship did exist between Chen and Sun, transferred the entire case to the District Prosecutor's Office yesterday for investigation according to law.</p>

<p>China Merchants Steam Navigation Company (招商局) Files Serious Protest</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company ship "Hai Xiang" was previously leased by the Material Supply Bureau. It sailed from Shanghai to Okinawa on the 8th of last month. After arriving on the island on the 10th at noon, it sailed to Okishiro Bay and other places, and returned to Shanghai on the morning of the 30th of last month. It transported vehicles and machinery from Okinawa and docked at the Qiujiang Wharf for unloading. Unexpectedly, on the 1st of this month, a number of guards from the Material Supply Bureau's guard group boarded the ship and declared a search. They searched each crew member's cabin, regardless of rank, and took away the crew members' belongings and the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's public property on board. They also sealed the cabins of crew members who were not on the ship. The captain reported the situation to the head office. It is understood that the company has filed a serious protest against the actions of the Material Supply Bureau's guard group, claiming that the matter was not agreed upon in advance, and demanded an apology and the return of public and private property. As of last night, the negotiations had not yet yielded any results.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper] The Zhenru Machinery Factory of UNRRA (United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration) recently had an embezzlement case where UNRRA housing materials worth 20 million Legal Tender were stolen and sold. Five Chinese employees of the factory have been arrested. Later, it was discovered that the factory's deputy director, Hubert R. Heath, an American, was also a suspect. The police station arrested him last Saturday and transferred him to the District Court for interrogation. According to Article 32, Section 3 of the UNRRA document, "The participating governments agree to exempt UNRRA staff from judicial proceedings in their territories for negligence occurring in the exercise of their official duties. However, for acts outside the scope of their official duties, and when not exercising their official duties, they shall not be exempt from their individual legal responsibilities." Since Heath, as a UNRRA employee in China, has violated the law, our courts naturally have the right to try him.</p>
<p>UNRRA authorities here have interrogated Heath and found his statements unsatisfactory. They have expressed their willingness to cooperate with the Chinese authorities to investigate this embezzlement case.</p>

<p>Medical and Health</p>
<p>(1) Hearing Loss in Both Ears</p>
<p>Hang Fangyu first asked whether I was generally healthy, but after suffering from malignant malaria in April of this year, I have suffered from anemia, neurasthenia, and other symptoms. In July, I came to Hangzhou from my hometown. The journey was arduous, and I was extremely exhausted. I had blood in my stool, and my urination was painful. I discovered that I had leucorrhea (I have never been involved with prostitutes). I took two bottles of "Uleron" pills and was cured. However, in the past week, I have had difficulty hearing, and I seem to have hearing loss. I ask (1) Is it possible that my wife's leucorrhea could have been transmitted to her husband and turned into leucorrhea? What medicine should I take to eradicate it? (2) What is the cause of the hearing difficulty?</p>
<p>(Answer from Dr. Zhang Zhongming) (1) Leucorrhea is caused by physical weakness or local inflammation. It may be infected with gonorrhea diplococcus. You should take Sulfadizine pills or inject Penicillin. (2) The hearing difficulty may be caused by taking an excessive amount of Uleron pills.</p>
<p>(2) Spinal Tuberculosis</p>
<p>Xi Yimin asked: My younger brother is 12 years old this year and is physically weak. Between spring and summer of last year, three sections of his spine suddenly protruded, forming a semicircle, slightly swollen but not painful, and walking is difficult. Treatment by Chinese medicine was ineffective. He is now recuperating at home. I would like to ask the following three questions: (1) Is this condition dangerous? What is the name of the disease? (2) How should this condition be treated to be effective? (3) If left untreated, will it cause adverse consequences? Is it necessary to take supplements?</p>
<p>(Answer from Dr. Zhang Zhongming) (1) The disease is called spinal tuberculosis. If it is not cured early, there is a risk of becoming disabled or developing tuberculous meningitis. (2) A plaster cast should be applied or he should lie on a hard bed. (3) At the same time, attention should be paid to nutrition and more supplements should be taken.</p>

<h3 id="e118">Fourth Period Yarn Allocation: First Phase Started Yesterday; Standards Revised for Allocation to National and Private Factories; Adjusted Conversion Ratios and Negotiated Prices <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>[Our report] The joint distribution of cotton yarn to the Restoring Party by national and private yarn factories for the first phase of the fourth period began yesterday. However, there have been slight changes in the details of yarn allocation compared to the past: (1) The calculation of the conversion ratio of each count of yarn to 20-count yarn. Because the previously set calculation table was not very accurate, a new, more precise statistical table has been formulated. (2) The allocation of yarn to national and private factories is now based on the actual number of spindles opened by each factory. Based on the 709,316 spindles opened by the China Textile Construction Corporation and the 1,011,809 spindles opened by private factories, the China Textile Construction Corporation should be allocated slightly more than two-fifths of the total yarn, and private factories should be allocated slightly less than one-fifth. (3) According to the original negotiated price, 42-count single-strand yarn was quoted at 2.77 million yuan per piece, and 42-count double-strand yarn was quoted at 2.79 million yuan per piece, a difference of 20,000 yuan, which was obviously inappropriate. The new price for 42-count double-strand yarn has been set at 3.46 million yuan per piece based on production costs and submitted to the Textile Control Commission for approval before implementation.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the total amount of cotton yarn jointly distributed by national and private yarn factories was 5,181 pieces, equivalent to 6,160.26 pieces of 20-count yarn. This included 30 pieces of 6-count yarn, 684 pieces of 10-count yarn, 415 pieces of 16-count yarn, 2,940 pieces of 20-count yarn, 270 pieces of 32-count yarn, 150 pieces of 32-count double-strand yarn, 130 pieces of 40-count TK yarn, 119 pieces of 40-count yarn, 436 pieces of 42-count double-strand yarn, and 7 pieces of 60-count yarn.</p>
<p>The China Textile Construction Corporation was allocated an estimated 1,507 pieces of the above total amount of cotton yarn. The counts and prices of cotton yarn are as follows: 20-count Caiqiu, Shuiyue, and Riguang tube yarn, 200 pieces of each, totaling 600 pieces, at 1.75 million yuan per piece. 32-count Longmen Dabao, 200 pieces, at 2.32 million yuan per piece. 32-count double-strand Xiantao tube yarn, 150 pieces, at 2.61 million yuan per piece. 40-count Baoguang Caobao, 100 pieces, at 2.77 million yuan per piece. 40-count TK Caiqiu tube yarn, 50 pieces, at 4.12 million yuan per piece. 42-count double-strand Lima tube thread, 170 pieces, at 2.79 million yuan per piece. 42-count double-strand Baoguang Caobao, 130 pieces, at 2.79 million yuan per piece. 42-count double-strand Lanfeng Dabao, 100 pieces, at 2.79 million yuan per piece. 60-count Riguang tube yarn, 7 pieces, at 5.15 million yuan per piece. The prices of the above 42-count double-strand yarn are yet to be adjusted.</p>
<p>As for the 1,500 pieces of cotton yarn sold to yarn retailers, the China Textile Construction Corporation was allocated 618 pieces, and private factories were allocated 882 pieces.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the Central Bank continued to tighten controls. After a high opening, trading turned volatile. Opening at 2.733 million, there was a rush to buy, and the price gradually rose, soon reaching over 2.76 million. After a period of hovering, buyers gained the upper hand, and the price rose again to over 2.77 million before pressure pushed it down slightly. After 10:00 am, the Central Bank allocated 40 bars at a price of 2.75 million, and the pressure continued, with repeated sales, leading to a change in the situation. At noon, the price fell back to 2.715 million. In the afternoon, the supply of sources became sluggish again, and sentiment reversed. Next-day delivery rose again to around 2.755 million, an increase of 31,000 compared to last Saturday. Gold ornaments were listed at 990,000. Silver bullion and silver dollars remained flat. Shadow interest rates remained flat. Interest rates ranged from 1.2 to 1.5 jiao.</p>
<p>Foreign currencies weakened after initial strength. The US dollar opened at 4,920 yuan to 4,970 yuan, and at one point approached 5,000 yuan. Later, due to the decline in the gold market, it was also affected, and at noon it fell to below 4,900 yuan. Although it rose in the afternoon, the increase was not significant, hovering around 4,900 yuan. As a result, it fell slightly compared to last Saturday. The Hong Kong exchange rate rose to over 970 yuan due to the drop in Shen Dian and the tying up of Western merchants. The Indian exchange rate was 1,180 yuan, and the British exchange rate was 15,800 yuan. The official exchange rate for the US dollar remained unchanged, and there was still no counterpart trading.</p>

<p>The bond market was even more stagnant yesterday. Only a few hundred thousand of the popular Unified Bing bonds were traded. There were no transactions in miscellaneous bonds. Therefore, the asking price was only slightly different from last Saturday. The Unified Bing bonds opened at 1,360 yuan, with the lowest price at 1,350 yuan, and then rose back to 1,390 yuan. Finally, it struggled between 1,380 yuan and 1,290 yuan, resulting in a decrease of 30 yuan compared to last Saturday.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the yarn market was initially depressed but then rebounded. There was strong demand for 20-count yarn from buyers, and there was also a large supply for sale. However, due to the high prices of fine yarn and double-strand thread, buyers were reluctant to purchase. Over-the-counter prices were quoted at 5.25 million for 42-count Lanfeng, 3.25 million for 32-count Lanfeng, 3.15 million for Yinyue, 2.65 million for 20-count Te Shuangma, and 2.4 million for Da Feiting, which is 20,000 to 30,000 higher than last week.</p>
<p>The offloading of cotton cloth to various areas along the Yangtze River continued to be active. Merchants from Tianjin and Hankou also absorbed some supply. The market was slightly bullish due to the Lunar New Year season. High-end shirting was quoted at 162,000 yuan, and Longtou fine cloth was quoted at 99,000 yuan. Biji and Zhigong were slightly higher.</p>

<p>Although the woolen fabric market showed a slight improvement compared to the previous day, with increased transactions in the early morning, it was difficult for standard prices to improve. This was because of the abundant supply of goods and the influence of interest rates on seized goods. Both buyers and sellers adopted a cautious approach. High-quality all-wool woolen fabrics, overcoat wool, suit wool, Harris Tweed, and Homburg were generally released by those who deal in seized goods, due to seasonal factors, interest rates, and fixed delivery dates.</p>

<p>The coal market saw sustained sales of white coal lump, and prices continued to rise. Due to the depletion of inventory of white coal dust, Hongji dust has risen to 320,000 yuan per ton, and there are still few sellers. The market for bituminous coal was relatively weak because industry players heard that the Fuel Control Commission had sent a letter to the association to investigate the coal stocks of various industry players, but the market price remained flat.</p>

<p>The rice market saw a total of over 9,000 shi of rice arriving from the north and south. Early rice and Bo rice were relatively scarce, while Su Tong粳 and Bei粳 were more abundant. Xian rice was still scarce, and the market was relatively stable. High-quality Bei粳 rose slightly by 300 to 500 yuan, Nan粳 rose by 1,000 yuan, Su Tong粳 was similar, and Xian rice remained firm due to scarcity. Bai阴元 remained flat and fair, with little price fluctuation.

There was a strong selling sentiment as supply exceeded demand. Yellow beans remained flat, broad beans hovered in a state of weakness, green beans remained stable, red beans were similar, red sorghum was in demand from distilleries and showed a bullish trend, string beans were being purchased in Shantou, and prices rose by over 2,000 yuan. Sesame from Guangzhou continued to be transacted, and prices remained firm. Raw peanuts from Southeast Asia remained unchanged, corn was similar, soybean cake was quiet in Minhua, and Shantou and Xiamen were active but not strong, with fluctuating prices, but the changes were minimal.

<p>Chinese stocks initially declined yesterday due to the unsettling impact of the city's disorder on public sentiment, but many parties seized the opportunity to rise and continuously increase their positions, leading to a rebound. Short sellers faced resistance at higher levels, and ultimately the market became uncertain. Chang Kai stocks initially declined, but there was buying interest in stock No. 232 after the opening, leading to a sudden improvement in sentiment. Stocks No. 67, 36, 177, and 30 were also bought, triggering an upward trend. The supply of shares dried up, and buying sentiment became increasingly enthusiastic, leading to higher prices. At high prices, stocks No. 176 and 199 were sold at higher levels, and merchants from Guangzhou also supplied shares. As a result, the 500 yuan barrier for Yong yarn was initially met with some resistance, but ultimately stock Nos. 8 and 9 advanced, and after stock No. 199 was sold and then repurchased, the 500 yuan barrier was finally broken, and high prices appeared. Subsequently, stock No. 151 frequently exerted pressure, but struggled repeatedly at the 500 yuan level. There was active over-the-counter supply, and stock No. 151 continued to sell, while stock No. 92 of Yong yarn also sold, and stocks No. 38 and 82 sold to Xinnuo. Near noon, there were some profit-taking and a slight decline in sentiment. As a result, compared to the previous close, Yong yarn, Meiya, and Huafeng rose slightly, while Xinnuo, Jingfu, and Qinxing declined slightly, Xinguang remained flat, and Rongfeng, a less popular stock, rose slightly, Datong Match remained flat, and the rest declined slightly. For the next-day delivery, Yong yarn and Huafeng rose slightly, and the rest declined slightly. In the afternoon, the market turned bearish, and there was a constant stream of over-the-counter supply. Stocks No. 2, 8, 9, 176, and 157 were sold. At lower prices, merchants from Guangzhou and others supported and rebounded. After the close, asking prices stabilized slightly. As a result, compared to last Saturday, Yong yarn, Xinguang, Qinxing, and Huafeng declined slightly, Meiya, Xinnuo, and Jingfu each fell by about half a percent, Datong Match, a less popular stock, remained flat, China Silk declined significantly by slightly less than ten percent, and the rest declined slightly. For the next-day delivery, Yong yarn, Qinxing, and Huafeng declined slightly, and Meiya, Xinnuo, and Xinguang each fell by about half a percent. Over-the-counter stocks remained relatively stable.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks retreated slightly yesterday, and trading was sluggish. As a result, compared to last Saturday, Yisha, British United Airways, and Paper fell slightly, Jardine Matheson fell slightly less than half a percent, and Yee Guang, Yibei, and Steel each fell slightly more than half a percent.</p>
<h3 id="e132">China Farmers Bank Convenes Meeting for 1947 Tea Loans; Formulating National Tea Loan Plan for Next Year <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>In order to support the export industry and balance international receipts and payments, the China Farmers Bank has organized various tea loans this year, but only in three regions: Tunxi, Pinglu, and Wenzhou. Fujian, Yunnan, Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, and Sichuan provinces are also tea-producing regions. In order to encourage exports, the bank has decided to expand tea loans next year and implement them nationwide. A meeting for 1947 tea loans was convened in Shanghai yesterday (the 1st). In addition to reviewing this year's tea loan business, the meeting also discussed the plan for universally implementing tea loans next year. The important topics of discussion included: (1) Estimating the production volume in each region for 1947; (2) Coordinating the loan amounts for purchasing raw tea in each region for 1947; (3) Coordinating agricultural production loans for 1947; (4) Export issues. Other proposals included purchasing procedures, warehousing, transportation, and other matters. After this meeting, a concrete plan for tea loans for next year will be formulated based on each topic and submitted for approval before implementation. The plan for next year will provide loans for all aspects of the tea industry, including production, purchasing, transportation, and export. The loans will be divided into: (1) Production loans, which will be lent to tea farmers for production; (2) Purchasing and tea-making loans, which will be lent to tea manufacturers for purchasing and making refined finished products; (3) Transportation and sales loans, which will be lent to tea merchants for transportation and sales, divided into export documentary bills and loan collateral; (4) Export documentary bills, which will be lent to tea merchants for transporting tea from export ports to foreign countries. These loans will be used for rapid circulation. The biggest difficulty in tea exports is the high cost, and high-interest loans are a major reason. The current cost of Qimen black tea is about 500,000 yuan per dan, and the burden of black market interest accounts for almost a quarter of the cost. The same is true in Pinglu and Tunxi. In order to open up foreign markets, reducing costs is the biggest key. According to an authority in the tea industry, reducing costs is only one aspect. Other factors, such as personnel management and unnecessary waste, are also factors that increase costs. It is hoped that industry players will conduct a thorough review themselves and work together to survive and save the crisis under the painstaking assistance of the government and the Farmers Bank.</p>
<h3 id="e133">Start of Mortgage for Stored Tea <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>In order to promote national policy and alleviate the difficulties of tea merchants, the China Farmers Bank began to mortgage over 20,000 boxes of Shanghai tea in its tea loan portfolio yesterday, stipulating a uniform 30% discount on cost and 3% interest. The prices are: (1) Ping Shui 200,000 yuan per dan (actual mortgage amount); (2) Green tea 280,000 yuan, Qimen 350,000 yuan. The China Farmers Bank's mortgage to the Central Bank is at 90%, with 1.8% interest. As for the large number of tea leaves in various places that are not loans, the tea merchant leaders once asked the Central Bank to mortgage them. The issue will be decided at the board meeting of the Four Banks Joint Treasury this Thursday. In addition, the issue of purchasing has already been submitted to the Ministry of Finance and Economics for review by the tea merchants in a joint name.</p>

<p>[United Press International, Washington, 1st] International Bank for Reconstruction and Development President McCloy, in response to a question at a press conference about the US halting a $90 million line of credit to Czechoslovakia, said that the bank would strive to avoid allowing any one country to determine its policies, and at the same time must avoid conflicting with the policies of any one country. This move by the United States was due to the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia's demand that US lending policies not restrict borrowing countries. According to the Bank President, the Bank may issue at least two types of securities to fund proposed loans. Seven countries have already notified the Bank of their intention to apply for credit. One type of security will be short-term, low-interest bonds, and the other will be long-term, high-interest bonds. McCloy said that most of the bonds would be sold in the United States, but if investors in other countries obtain permission from their governments, they may also subscribe to the International Bank's public bonds. The American business newspaper "The Wall Street Journal" said that investors will receive the International Bank's first notice of bond issuance at the end of November.</p>
<h3 id="e135">Increased Exchange Rates in South China to Prevent Capital Flight <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>The internal exchange rates of national banks were revised by the small group of the Four Banks Joint Treasury on the 30th. There have been increases and decreases in North and South China. The exchange rate for Guangzhou in South China has increased from 15 yuan to 28 yuan. Shantou and Shaozhou have increased from 25 yuan to 45 yuan. The rest of South China has increased from 30 yuan to 50 yuan, an increase of more than 90%. North China, on the other hand, has been reduced. Lianyungang has been reduced from 25 yuan to 20 yuan, and Qingdao has been reduced from 12 yuan to 10 yuan. The provinces and cities of Sichuan, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Hebei remain the same. It is reported that the increase in exchange rates in South China is due to the large amount of capital fleeing from Guangzhou and other places. This measure is a means of preventing capital flight.</p>
<h3 id="e136">Government to Establish Regulatory Commission to Develop National Silk Industry; Representatives of Silk Reeling Industry Petition in Nanjing <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>Faced with difficulties in both export sales and raw materials, China's silk industry is facing a complete shutdown. The current solution is to obtain 10 million pounds of Japanese dried cocoons through barter, which will last until the spring cocoon market next year. If raw materials cannot be obtained, silk reeling factories in various places will inevitably close, which will affect the silk weaving factories, the rural economy, the lives of workers, and even part of the financial industry. Therefore, the Silk Reeling Industry Association decided at the board of directors meeting on the 28th to send Chu Fucheng, Leng [blank], Shen Juru, Wang Huanan, Zhou Yuanxun, and others to Nanjing to petition the President of the Executive Yuan and the heads of various ministries, requesting two points: (1) The cost of autumn cocoons (including a profit of 500,000 yuan) is 6.4 million yuan per dan, while the market price of raw silk is only 60% of the cost. Although the China Trust Bureau has raised the purchase price of each grade by 400,000 yuan per dan, it is still far from enough. Therefore, it is hoped that the government will determine the purchase price based on the production cost of raw silk and that the China Trust Bureau will be responsible for continuing to purchase; (2) The industry has contacted our Ambassador to the United States, Gu Weijun, regarding the shipment of Japanese cocoons to China, asking him to directly negotiate with the authorities in Washington, but there has been no response. It is hoped that the government will actively negotiate with MacArthur to prevent the silk industry from falling into a desperate situation.</p>
<p>According to the China Silk Corporation, its General Manager Ge Jingzhong has just come to Shanghai from Nanjing and said that the government will establish a National Silk Industry Regulatory Commission in 1947 to supervise the improvement and management of the entire silk industry nationwide, so as to plan development under unified control.</p>

A total of several hundred lots were traded.</p>

<p>The stock of high-end Qimen tea, in the foreign tea market, has long been scarce. Furthermore, since the British merchant's foreign action last week, the stock has almost been exhausted. Still, yesterday the market saw many buyer accounts, but few transactions were made. The price trend is feared to be the highest. The export capacity of other teas is narrow, and the prices are suppressed severely, while there are still those who want to sell them, so the process remains depressed. The market for the colorless new large grade tea desired by the Americas is still calm, due to low prices offered. Tea merchants are in constant contact via telephone to request price increases, the result of which should come in a few days.</p>
<h3 id="e139">Four Banks Joint Treasury Approves Provincial Banks to Handle Production Loans; Can Apply for Re-mortgage; But Surplus Funds Should Also Be Deposited in National Banks <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>[Our report from Nanjing, 2nd] Provincial banks have recently complained that they do not have sufficient capital to handle loans for local production enterprises, so they asked national banks to provide interbank lending. It is now known that this proposal has been approved by the Four Banks Joint Treasury. Provincial banks, when handling loans for agricultural, forestry, industrial, mining, water conservancy, and other production enterprises related to local economic construction, may apply to national banks for re-mortgages and discounts if their own capital is insufficient. When necessary, the cases for which the provincial banks intend to apply to the national banks for re-mortgages and re-discounts should be submitted to the Four Banks Joint Treasury for approval before handling. However, provincial banks should deposit their surplus funds in local national banks. In places where there are no national banks, they should deposit them in other national banks and not in commercial banks.</p>

<p>[Our report from Beiping, 2nd] The Ministry of Education recently ordered all specialized schools and above across the country not to establish multiple campuses and to manage education in separate locations. Schools that have already established branch campuses and managed education in separate locations due to the impact of the war should merge immediately. It is reported that the Ministry of Education believes that various public and private specialized schools were affected by the war, transportation restrictions, or moved with the government to different locations, or moved to safe areas, or remained in occupied areas, resulting in the establishment of branch campuses or separate locations for teaching, which was originally a measure to protect teaching rights and interests. Now that victory has been achieved for over a year, they should return to their original form to facilitate management and education. In addition, the Ministry of Education further ordered all schools to obtain approval before expanding their departments and not to enroll students first.</p>

<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 2nd] The Ministry of Education considers national education to be the foundation of nation-building. However, in recent years, the funding for primary schools in various regions has been stretched. Especially after the changes in the fiscal revenue and expenditure system, many provinces have reduced their national education funding due to various difficulties. Therefore, the Ministry of Education has issued a general order to the education departments of various provinces, providing two key points that should be noted when compiling national education funding: (1) The national education funding should be included in the provincial education budget. In addition to subsidizing national schools in various counties (cities) to improve their facilities, special subsidies should be provided to primary schools with funding shortages and excellent performance. (2) The budget for education funding in each county (city) should not be lower than the percentage of the budget in the 26th year of the Republic. In addition, if possible, efforts should be made to raise sufficient funds to implement the universal education plan in stages.</p>

<p>Wang Ruchang Reports at Memorial Week</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Wang Ruchang, Director of the Social Education Department of the Municipal Education Bureau, reported on the social education work in Shanghai in the past year at the Municipal Government Memorial Week at 9:00 a.m. yesterday (2nd), stating that 170,000 illiterate people can be eliminated this year, and more than ten vocational supplementary schools will be added. He reported separately on the bureau's acceptance and reorganization work, mass school education, various social education facilities, and future development plans as follows:</p>
<p>Acceptance and Reorganization Work</p>
<p>After the restoration of Shanghai, the Wenlang Mass Education Center was slightly repaired and could be used. The museum, library, stadium, and botanical garden in the city center district were difficult to restore, either because the troops had not been withdrawn or because the cultural relics had been lost. In January of this year, two exhibition rooms were opened on North Sichuan Road to establish a museum. The swimming pool was opened during the summer vacation of this year. The stadium has also been restored.</p>
<p>Mass School Education</p>
<p>The Municipal Education Bureau regards eliminating illiteracy as the central work of social education. The population of Shanghai is 3.5 million, and there are at least more than one million illiterate people. A plan for universally promoting mass education was formulated, aiming to eliminate it within five years. The methods adopted are as follows: 108 mass schools were established, graduating once every four months, urging municipal private primary and secondary schools and social education institutions to concurrently run mass schools. A total of 1,000 classes have been opened, with 50,000 students, and 650 classes have graduated, with 30,000 students. In August, 800 mass education literacy classes were established, with 40,000 students. About 30,000 people are expected to graduate by the end of the term. In this year, 170,000 illiterate people can be eliminated. In addition, six municipal vocational supplementary schools and three general supplementary schools have been established. Recently, one school has been added to Yimiao, which has already enrolled students and started classes. One school in Hongkou is still in preparation. As for private supplementary schools, factories and companies are encouraged to establish them on their own. Twenty-three have been established. However, the general private supplementary schools in this city often enroll students without going through the filing procedures, and should be banned. As of the end of November, 44 schools have applied to the bureau for filing, 4 correspondence schools, 5 schools for the deaf and blind, and 3 mass schools. Staff are still being sent to investigate. Those with good results will be subsidized, and those that do not meet the requirements will be ordered to close.</p>
<p>Various Social Education Facilities</p>
<p>In addition to restoring the Wenlang Mass Education Center, two branch libraries have been established in Gaoqiao and Dachang, and the Yangjing branch library is being prepared for establishment. The regular work of each library includes reading newspapers and magazines, health activities, household affairs guidance, and popular lectures. In rural areas, agricultural demonstration and handicraft improvement are held. In addition to the main library on Fuzhou Road, the library has one branch library and twelve circulation stations. The museum is on North Sichuan Road. The science museum is located at 601 Jiaozhou Road, with physics and chemistry departments for the use of public and private middle school students. The gymnasium is on Shaanxi Road, with a fitness room for free activities for the public. The stadium has also been renovated recently. The educational experimental areas are one in Tangqiao, Pudong, and one in Zhenru, West Shanghai. The experimental mass schools have children's, women's, adult, and supplementary classes, with attached nurseries, clinics, and household affairs rooms. The electrified education team has two 16mm projectors, and regularly travels to various schools in rural areas to screen educational films.</p>

<p>The second round of the Football A League will begin this week. The Football Committee issued Notice No. 7 yesterday. The schedule for this week has been arranged.

<p>In the first round of the A League, the Jewish team easily defeated the Soviet Union, and Hequn narrowly defeated Youyou 2-1. In this second round, the two sides will meet again. Youyou is now a different team and is in very good condition. It tied Qingbai 1-1. After narrowly winning Youyou in the first game, Hequn has been defeated in every game since then. Youyou should be able to take revenge this week.</p>
<p>In the first round between Donghua and Longjie, the former defeated the latter 2-1. Donghua was invincible in the first week, with outstanding performance and great momentum, and had the ambition to win the A League championship. However, Longjie is not weak. Although it lost to Donghua in the first week, it has won every game since then. Its generals are young, strong, and full of morale.

<p>The Philippine overseas Chinese Black and White Men's and Women's Basketball Team came to Shanghai last month to learn from various strong teams. However, due to the cold weather, many players were not used to it, resulting in injuries. Therefore, the team's performance in Shanghai was affected and did not reach its full potential. Now that the schedule has been completed, they are returning south in batches. Yesterday (2nd), due to ticket reasons, the first batch of 20 people, led by Secretary Huang Rongjie, took a China Airlines flight to Xiamen. According to a telegram from the local area, they have arrived safely at their destination and have begun to contact the opposing team and will hold charity games to raise funds to benefit the disaster victims. However, Xiao Huatuo, a member of the team staying in Shanghai, has not yet recovered from his arm injury and urgently needs to rest. Cai Jindian and Wu Yuwu of the women's team both need to take a boat from Shanghai to the Philippines early due to holiday reasons. Therefore, the rumor that Xiao and Cai are "joining Qingbai to play in Hong Kong" is not true. The remaining team members in Shanghai are also scheduled to take a flight to Xiamen on Friday (6th) this week, accompanied by team leader Cai Lianfa, to join forces. After the competition, they will return to the Philippines.</p>

<p>The municipal government, regarding the "Regulations for Increasing the Standards of Fines," has already been promulgated and implemented by the National Government. According to Article 3 of these regulations: "Fines to be imposed according to law shall be increased up to three hundred times the original amount." Whether household registration fines can be imposed by analogy to these regulations, or whether they still need to be handled in accordance with the "Wartime Regulations for Increasing the Standards of Fines," was clarified by telegram from the Ministry of Interior, which stated: "The 'Regulations for Increasing the Standards of Fines' were promulgated and implemented by the National Government on October 14, 1946. According to the principle that later laws take precedence over earlier laws, the 'Wartime Regulations for Increasing the Standards of Fines' are no longer applicable after the promulgation of these regulations. Chapter 7 of the current Household Registration Law, concerning penalties, does not contain the provisions referred to in the provisos of Articles 1 and 3 of the former regulations. Therefore, household registration fines can each be increased up to one hundred times according to the provisions of the first sections of Articles 1, 3, and 2 of the same regulations. This is in addition to notifying various provincial and municipal governments to comply and instructing subordinates to take note."</p>

Furthermore, Cai Guoliang was selected as bao head and Zhang Yuankun as deputy bao head by the jia heads of the twentieth bao of the twelfth district (Jiangning), and they have been respectively appointed by the municipal government.</p>
<p>The thirteenth bao of the fourth district (Penglai), due to the addition of straw huts in the twenty-sixth jia, plans to add a jia and has selected Xu Juru as jia head. The ninth bao of the twenty-third district (Wusong), due to the increase in boat households, has added a jia and appointed Bai Rufu as jia head.

<h3 id="e169">Building Nanchang as a Model City <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>— Fourth Dispatch from Liu Zao, our Nanchang Reporter</p>
<p>The war destroyed Nanchang, but a new Nanchang is being rebuilt after the war. To rebuild Nanchang, the central government has designated it as a model city. Urban planning expert Mr. Fitch from the Executive Yuan, Section Chief Shen Erming from the Ministry of Interior, and Director Ha Xiongwen from the Construction Department of the Ministry of Interior have successively come to Nanchang to conduct on-site inspections. Mayor Ying Xin convened a forum with people from all walks of life while Director Ha and others were surveying the province. There was a detailed discussion on how to construct Nanchang as a model city. Regarding the overall construction plan, Mr. Fitch advocated adding a residential area to the original first and second industrial zones, and also adding an industrial zone to the residential area south of the city to reach a compromise. The original plan for the sewer system was for it to flow from the East and West Lakes into Qinglan Lake, and then into the Gan River. However, Mr. Fitch suggested that it flow from the north of the city into the Gan River, and that the area around Qinglan Lake be designated as a scenic area. The old airfield would be designated as an administrative area, and the existing Jieshi Park would be expanded into a Central Park. The areas around the East and West Lakes would all be designated as parks.</p>
<p>How to build a new Nanchang? This article will introduce the construction plan as a reference for those concerned about municipal construction.</p>
<p>Current Status of the City; Original Construction Plan</p>
<p>Post-war Nanchang is a crippled city. Of the original 45,214 tall shops and residences, 35,205 were destroyed by the fires of war. The total loss accounts for 75% of the original buildings. The war destroyed Nanchang, so a new Nanchang should be built after the war.</p>
<p>Nanchang's existing urban area is on the east bank of the Gan River. The reconstruction of the streets has already formed a model of excellent new urban construction. There are four lakes in the center of the urban area. The city center is around the shores of the lakes and the banks of the Gan River, so Nanchang's urban area is a basin.</p>
<p>The city's external transportation includes countless sailboats and steamers on the Gan River by waterway, and the Nanxun, Zhegan, and Ganxiang railways and several highways by land. The Nanxun railway and highway extending northward start from Niuhang on the west bank of the Gan River. The Zhegan and Xianggan roads extending eastward and westward start from the east bank of the Gan River. The traffic on the east and west banks is connected by the Zhongzheng Bridge, which connects the entire traffic artery of Jiangxi and completes a flexible transportation network.</p>
<p>Nanchang's municipal construction plan has long had a detailed plan. The formulation of this plan is based on the inevitable increase in Nanchang's population in the future, and the inevitable trend of industrial development. However, according to Mr. Fitch's survey, he believes that if the industry cannot be developed reasonably, the population will not increase rapidly and significantly. Although Nanchang is the administrative center and the location of the provincial capital, this cannot be a reason for a substantial increase in population. Regarding the zoning of businesses, Mr. Fitch advocated a slight correction to the original plan. According to the existing zoning plan, there are three industrial zones: the first zone is on the west bank of the Gan River, the second zone is on the peninsula in the Gan River north of the city, and the third zone is on the east bank of the Gan River, part of the urban area north of the city. There are also three residential zones, one commercial zone, one administrative zone, and one cultural zone. The improvement of water, highway, railway, and air transportation systems has not been taken into account in this original plan.</p>
<p>Design Principles; Reconstruction of the Urban Area</p>
<p>The construction plan for the new urban area is based on two principles: (1) the reconstruction of the destroyed urban area, and (2) the future development of the Nanchang metropolitan area. These two stages must be coordinated with each other. The design of an important group center without a clear understanding of the organization of the attached areas is impossible. The distribution, location, quantity, etc. of each area depend on the conditions of its commercial center.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in the case of Nanchang, it is impossible to have an accurate estimate of the future population. The design should be based on the principle of distribution, that is, dividing the entire metropolitan area into several mutually useful zones, with the existing urban area as the autonomous center. Each zone must have a branch office, a branch post office, a branch police station, and an elementary school. If possible, a middle school should also be established. In the center of the existing urban area, land should be reserved for the construction of a municipal university. This institution should not be located within any zone. Applying this distribution principle can start the construction of the existing Nanchang urban area center without the need to reserve a large open area as necessary for the construction of district offices and schools. If developed according to the concentric principle, this is an unavoidable fact, which not only incurs unnecessary land costs but also impairs the scenery. The urban area reconstruction plan should naturally start with the four lakes in the urban area, and incorporate the lake area into a park. The existing Jieshi Park should be expanded into a Central Park. However, the prerequisite is to find suitable land to exchange for the private property occupied by the park. The old airfield in the east of the city is no longer in use, and some people advocate using this site for exchange.</p>
<p>Wide roads should be built around the Central Park, surrounding the park, and suitable connections should be made with other traffic lines. The most important of these is the connection line along the road around the park to the north corner and the Zhongzheng Bridge across the Gan River.</p>
<p>Two rows of houses can be built along the road around the park and the Central Park. The beautiful and magnificent environment of these houses, which can overlook all the scenery in the park, can be imagined. The original ring road will be the future commercial area. There is a wide market in the center of the area. The section of the ring road along the Gan River has been extended to the north and south, and it is expected to become a riverside avenue in the future.</p>
<p>Because the distribution principle is adopted for the design, the intention to set up a cultural zone has been abandoned. However, within the scope of the old airfield, land should be reserved for the construction of a municipal university. The south of the university site within the airfield is the planned administrative area. According to the Chinese customs of official residences, which are usually facing south, the main road of the administrative area is planned to be built along the southern boundary of the airfield. A part of the official residences can be directly reached from this main road, and others can be reached through parallel paths and courtyards.</p>
<p>South of the administrative area, a central railway station is planned to be set up, and a bus station is set up nearby. The square in front of the railway station and bus station is connected by the main traffic road in the urban area. In order for the railway station to have a suitable marshalling yard, the track opening south should be moved eastward. After the track is moved, there will be the following two advantages: the future expansion of the urban area group will not be restricted or obstructed by the track. In this way, it will be more convenient to find a site for the bridge connecting the north and south railways in the future.</p>
<p>Special attention should be paid to the method of reconstruction of the urban area's sewer system. The lowest section of the urban area is the center of the city. Most of the city's drainage water must flow to the central urban area, and then be discharged into the river by a pumping station. The outlet should preferably be at the downstream end of the urban area. The detailed design should be carefully studied by sanitation engineering experts before implementation. Mr. Fitch suggested building an underground reservoir that can have a buffer capacity under normal conditions. The reservoir has an overflow outlet. In the event of heavy rain, the increased volume of water can be discharged into the lake through the overflow, so that the drainage water, which is diluted to a considerable extent, will not pollute the lake water.</p>
<p>The current location of the water and electricity plant cannot meet the needs of the people with the future increase in population. Because there is no open land near the plant for future expansion, a large-scale model water and electricity plant should be rebuilt in a selected location in the planned industrial zone, and attention should be paid to the water intake and supply of the power plant.</p>
<p>The focus of Nanchang's future development is the designation and construction of industrial and residential zones. The currently selected industrial zone is planned to be located in the north of the urban area. In addition, a secondary industrial zone will be set up near the road to the south to engage in the construction of light industry. The first and second industrial zones are located on the east and west banks of the Gan River, respectively, which is extremely convenient for water transportation.</p>
<p>The first industrial zone is located on the west bank of the Gan River. The terrain is very high, and there are shallows on the bank that are completely exposed when the water level is low. However, the area is quite far from the main stream. The remedy is to build a dredged shallow river and build a canal port extending into the area to facilitate water transportation. The maintenance of this canal requires frequent dredging. If the design is excellent, the cost will not be huge.</p>
<p>To the west of the first industrial zone, it is planned to set up a railway line, station, and depot, so as to obtain contact with various industries.</p>
<p>The second industrial zone is located on the east bank of the Gan River. In contrast to the first zone, the terrain of the area is extremely low. When the water level is high, it falls below the horizontal line, and a levee should be used for protection. Therefore, the area also needs to build a river channel extending into the river channel through the embankment. Because the terrain is too low, the river channel must have a sluice to adjust the water level, so as to prevent the water level from being submerged when the water level is high.</p>
<p>The size of the river port and factory is the same as that of the first zone, and everything is aimed at a medium scale, and appropriate development should be made in light of the actual situation. The location of the size of the river entering the river must also be determined after water conservancy experiments. In this area, preparations must be made to build the foundation of a larger-scale water and electricity plant in the future, so as to avoid the water and electricity being polluted by the waste water discharged by the factory.</p>
<p>The residential area will be attached to the industrial area in the future, so as to shorten the distance between the factory and the employees' residence. The disadvantage of the original zoning plan is that the distance is too far. According to Mr. Fitch's new plan, the first residential area should be in the west bank of the Gan River. Set up a zone for the employees of the West Bank Industrial Zone. The area is separated from the industrial zone and the Nanjiu and Nanwan highways by the aforementioned lawn. According to Mr. Fitch's opinion, this lawn is not used as a park, so it will not cause any loss, and the original value of the land can be maintained.</p>
<p>The second residential area is planned to be set up in the south of the second industrial zone for the residence of employees in the area.</p>
<p>The third residential area is planned to be set up in the north of the city, and is not connected to any industrial area. The original residential area in the north of the city will only be expanded. The area is suitable for residents with higher incomes.</p>
<p>The fourth residential area is planned to be set up on the northeast and east sides of the administrative area and the municipal university, and is bounded by the railway station to the south. The south side is the newly built railway station warehouse. This area is planned to be used by residents who originally lived in the new central park.</p>
<p>In the south of the city center and the fourth residential area, it is planned to set up two more residences, one of which can be used as the residence of the third industry in the east of the railway line.</p>
<p>Finally, the southeastern area of Nanchang is occupied by the new airfield. According to the decision of the Montreux Conference in 1946, there should be a considerable open space around the airfield, and no houses should be built, and no obstacles such as power lines should be erected. Therefore, the use of the land should be farmland.</p>
<p>Construction Plan; How to Implement in the Future</p>
<p>The implementation of this new construction plan must also be divided into two parts, one is the reconstruction of the destroyed area, and the other is the expansion of the collective urban area. The implementation of the second plan—the expansion of the urban area—is not difficult. Within the scope to be expanded, except for buildings related to agriculture, all others will not be built.</p>
<p>Regarding the construction of the three industrial zones, Mr. Fitch advocated building the second zone first—the east bank of the Gan River—building the river channel sluice extending into the embankment, as well as the southern side port. The reason for his suggestion is that the establishment of factories is determined by a suitable foundation. If it is allowed to develop on its own, the factory foundation selected by the factory may not be within the area. If it is planned to build an industrial zone, it can provide more convenience, and it will definitely become an industrial center after a considerable period of time. The correlation between industries and mutual solicitation is well known.</p>
<p>There are many difficulties in the implementation of the reconstruction plan in the destroyed area. It will not be successful unless decisive measures are taken. Mr. Fitch believes that the redistribution of land is the only effective method for reconstruction according to the plan, that is, the development of the land in the destroyed area. If the land cannot be redistributed, cooperation among all industries is necessary. Otherwise, it will not only cause endless negotiations, but as a result, nine-tenths of the plan will not be implemented. At most, only a compromise solution can be obtained. The implementation of this plan does not require the municipal government to allocate new land for compensation. If the old airfield is public, the compensation can be used. The old airfield is public property, and it is divided into suitable small pieces to compensate the owners of the land requisitioned by the Central Park, and the land in the park can also be divided into small pieces for the same purpose.</p>
<p>The second problem in the new construction is the construction of houses. A distinction should be made between permanent and temporary houses. The lifespan of temporary houses is far longer than the estimated warranty period. This is a recognized fact. The demolition of this building is extremely difficult, let alone in today's severe housing shortage. Mr. Fitch suggested that the construction of temporary houses be absolutely prohibited, on the foundation of the proposed permanent houses and on the foundation within the scope of the Central Park. The implementation of the park plan must not demolish houses that can still be used after the deadline. He believes that temporary houses are only allowed to be built on the foundation of the planned railway station field and the administrative area. When deciding to implement any conditions of this plan, the owners or residents will have no sufficient reason to oppose the demolition of the slower plan. The construction of permanent houses is of course based on the principle of not violating the new urban area construction plan, and the architectural design must be approved by the municipal authorities.</p>
<p>According to engineering calculations, Mr. Fitch estimated that the plan to build Nanchang as a model city will take 20 years to complete. However, with the current financial resources and manpower in Nanchang, it is not enough to bear the implementation of this great project. The municipal authorities are now determined to start with the greatest efforts from the near and small. Mayor Tang Xin hopes to use his own sweat and blood to promote its success. We also hope that the central government and people from all walks of life will assist and move towards the expected goal.</p>
<h3 id="e170">A Trip to Hai'an <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>— Dispatch from Ling Songchou, our Taixian Reporter, Hai'an, November 15</p>
<p>Before Dongtai was recovered, the reporter took some time to visit Hai'an. Originally, the original destination of this trip to the east was Hai'an; later, because the war on the front line progressed rapidly, the reporter went straight to Anfeng without stopping in Hai'an.</p>
<p>When you arrive in Hai'an Town, the most noticeable thing is the earthen city wall on the periphery. It follows the undulations of the terrain and surrounds the entire Hai'an. At the foot of the city, trenches are dug, and outside the trenches, caltrops are spread all over the place. The atmosphere is quite solemn. The Great King Temple east of the city is said to be one of the best monasteries in northern Jiangsu. However, the power of the Buddha could not stop the power of the fire. During this siege by the Communist army, all the buildings in the temple were destroyed. The two stone lions outside the mountain gate stood opposite the setting sun, adding infinite emotion to people. According to the Buddhist scriptures: "All conditioned phenomena are like dreams, illusions, bubbles, and shadows." This should also be "liberation", right?</p>
<p>During the nineteen-day siege by the Communist army, Hai'an suffered immeasurable losses in terms of materials; and in terms of spirit, the people of Hai'an, all those who have experienced this storm, I think they should never forget it in their lives. The gun smoke and bullets lasted for nineteen days. The terror of the war gave the people of Hai'an too much! During the three days the reporter was in Hai'an, he could feel it almost anytime, anywhere.</p>
<p>Someone said to me:</p>
<p>"I saw with my own eyes a shell flying over, and with a crash, half of a roof was lifted off!"</p>
<p>Someone said to me:</p>
<p>"One evening, I went to the street for something, and suddenly, with a bang, a shell landed less than twenty steps in front of my right. Oh my God, it was really dangerous! If I had come out earlier that day, or ran faster, I might have been buried in the dirt long ago!"</p>
<p>Someone else said to me:</p>
<p>"Hey! At that time, we just passed out in a daze. In fact, it's hard to say who was a human and who was a ghost at that time. Because there were too many opportunities to die! Today, we are really 'people'!"</p>
<p>Terror is terror, but it's just a memory. The reality in front of us is that under the protection of the National Army, the front line is getting farther and farther away every day; and the market in Hai'an is becoming more and more prosperous every day.</p>
<p>There are many vendors on the street, selling Flag oranges and glass belts, almost all American goods. The business is very good, and it feels much more active than the business in ordinary shops! In the markets of general recovered areas, many develop in such a distorted way!</p>
<p>Many red and green war reports are scattered on both sides of the street, such as "The National Army recovered Fuan at × o'clock this morning" or "Our army entered Tuofeng at × o'clock this morning" and so on. From this one thing, it reflects how excited and concerned the people are about the National Army's advance!</p>
<p>What creates a wartime flavor together with these war reports is the pillbox on the street. A pillbox is placed in the center of a bustling street, and at first glance, it seems that the road has been cut off. However, people who are used to running in northern Jiangsu know the inside story. Walk up to it, turn a corner, and you'll find "the willow trees are dark, the flowers are bright, and there is another village." There are also some pillboxes in Hai'an that are connected to the houses on both sides, with a door in the middle for pedestrians to enter and exit. The appearance and internal structure are simply a city gate. I never expected that the war barrier of the 16th century would still be useful today.</p>
<p>In recent decades, Hai'an has produced two calligraphers. One is Han Guojun, and the other is Tan Zuyun. Han Guojun's style name was Zishi. He once served as the governor of Jiangsu Province and made many contributions to the Yongli in northern Jiangsu. His calligraphy followed the style of the Northern Wei stele, which was vigorous and spectacular. It is said that he died in depression during the enemy puppet occupation. This spring, the newspaper reported that the National Government issued an order to commend him and held a public memorial service to honor his loyalty. Tan Zuyun's style name was Dezhong. He was also known as the Old Man of Hailing. He was the father-in-law of Han, and his calligraphy followed the Northern Wei style. He wrote the Book of Calligraphy very skillfully, and was as famous as President Tan Yanxi in Changsha. For a time, he was known as the Two Tans of the North and South. It is now heard that he is still alive and well. Because of these two calligraphers, the style of calligraphy is particularly strong in Hai'an. The Spring Festival couplets in general stores imitate the styles of the two of them, either Han's vigorousness or Tan's elegance. Of course, whether they look alike or not is another question. However, in a small way, it is enough to see that the spread of literary style, even if it is one or two people, is enough to change the atmosphere, without waiting for publicity and promotion to take effect.</p>
<p>Han is very admired in Hai'an. People call him Han Er Taiye (Second Master Han). Now his daughter, Ms. Liu Xian, is the chairman of the town chamber of commerce. With Han's literary talent, he can naturally benefit future generations. Han's residence is in Dongmen, which is quite elegant. The headquarters of the 65th Division stationed in the town is located inside. The reporter went in for a while to visit the commander of the division, General Li Zhen.</p>
<p>The reporter suspected that the room General Li was living in was Han's bedroom, because there was a portrait of Han on the wall.</p>
<p>The house is Chinese-style, and the room is full of banners presented to the division commander by various organizations and the national body. They are inscribed with "Southeast Barrier" and "Shield of the Nation." There is a small garden next to the house, with some pavilions and the like in the garden.</p>
<p>When the reporter went, the commander was reviewing documents. After a while, he got up to greet him. We then began a five-minute conversation.</p>
<p>The commander is from eastern Guangdong and is about 50 years old. He doesn't speak all Cantonese, so it's still understandable.</p>
<p>The reporter first asked the commander about the experience of being heavily besieged by the Communist army for nineteen days.</p>
<p>The commander said:</p>
<p>"The details are not clear for the time being. In short, the Communist army used more than 20 regiments of troops, while we only had one brigade, and external aid was completely cut off; fortunately, the people worked together to give us a lot of help."</p>
<p>Then the commander told the reporter a little about the brief history of the 65th Division:</p>
<p>"This division was established in Guangdong. Most of the soldiers are from Guangdong and Guangxi, and there are very few northerners. At first, they were responsible for defense along the coast, and then they fought in the Hunan and Jiangxi areas. This spring and summer, they were transferred from Zhejiang to Suzhou, and then from Jingjiang to northern Jiangsu."</p>
<p>The reporter also asked about the situation in northern Jiangsu, and asked him to express some opinions. He said very politely:</p>
<p>"We are purely an executive unit. Everything depends on the instructions of our superiors. There is no way to talk about opinions."</p>
<p>At this time, the reporter asked the commander to allow him to take a photo, and he agreed, but he said with a smile:</p>
<p>"It's best not to publish it in the newspaper, because the task of soldiers is to work! We don't pay attention to appearances." The commander is a typical Chinese soldier, speaking so calmly, and smiling so calmly!</p>
<p>The portrait of Han Guojun on the wall was smiling, as if congratulating his hometown for having such a general sitting here.</p>
<h3 id="e171">Idle Talk About the Guilin Market <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>— Airmail Report from November 18th, Our Guilin Correspondent Liang Xiaozhong</p>
<p>From outside the gate, looking at a household in constant turmoil, one always feels a bit of mystery and interest. Similarly, standing at an unfamiliar angle, sketching an outline of Guilin's "abacus family" also feels unfathomable.</p>
<p>Guilin has been a county since the Qin Dynasty. Throughout the vicissitudes of thousands of years, it has always been a capital city with a strong political atmosphere. The rise of merchants was, at most, a matter within a small circle, unable to have much impact. However, business is always business. Today, the common people know how to make money, and officials also admire the lofty spirit of Tao Zhu, making grand gestures. Before long, one can't help but feel a sense of "exactions from both above and below."</p>
<p>One of the Four Major Cities - A Different World Within</p>
<p>Those who compete for profit are in the market, and those who compete for fame also come to the market. Thinking of Yue Wu Mu's saying, "Civil officials do not love money," from the pursuit of profit, and then thinking of the massive bureaucratic capital groups in Guangxi today, such as certain trading companies, transportation firms, foreign goods stores, and hotels, one can't help but respect merchants. That being said, the principle of "market prosperity and commerce" is inseparable from this city. Today, Guilin is gradually returning to a superficial prosperity. Who can fail to appreciate the contributions of merchants and those who are both officials and merchants!</p>
<p>Guilin is one of the four major cities in Guangxi. Its trade and commerce are far less prosperous than Wuzhou, Liuzhou, and Nanning, and even less so than Guixian (a small city that suddenly rose to prominence due to its strategic transportation location). However, it borders Hunan to the north and relies on the Li River, with convenient highways to the north and south. The arteries connecting Hunan, Guangxi, and Guizhou are expected to open up, and air transport to Beijing and Shanghai provides same-day delivery. Therefore, it may not be without a different world within. Although the market is bleak compared to the bustling commerce of two years ago, it is still not comparable. However, its vitality is like spring grass after a fire. Given an opportunity, it is always the world of the bosses. Guilin itself has no special products; it is merely a hub for transshipment. Among the goods active in the market, there are not many visible ones. What there are should include "American equipment" in department stores and tung oil and sugar that come and go in a hurry.</p>
<p>Two Major Livelihoods for Brokers - Tung Oil and Sugar</p>
<p>The two major livelihoods for brokers are tung oil and sugar. The former's players keep their eyes on Guangzhou and Hong Kong, while the latter's customers listen to Hunan and Hankou. Goods are shipped out from Guilin in different directions, and then money flows back from both routes. Many people have made a fortune this way. The source of tung oil mostly comes from Hunan (even though Guangxi has been advocating planting tung trees for more than ten years, it still shouts for planting trees every year, but no trees are seen). With good luck, a single transaction can yield a profit of two or three percent. The trend has been good lately, with prices increasing tenfold. In one week, the price rose by 20,000 yuan (from 90,000 to 110,000), and it still looks strong. Oil brokers are smiling from ear to ear. Sugar is mainly produced in the Dahe area and is transported via automobile or up the Li River to Guilin, where it is transshipped to Hengyang and distributed to the Yuehan northern section area. The market is constantly advancing. Hunan customers have a strong appetite, taking in every batch. Top-quality refined sugar has hit the 170,000 mark. Slab sugar has also exceeded 80,000. These two items are the most precious in the entire market. In addition, Hunan paper is transported south, also seeing profitable routes. However, Jiangxi paper floods the market, resulting in poor sales. Many players are also involved in gasoline and kerosene, but unfortunately, the good times do not last long. Prices rise and fall too quickly. White gasoline plunged 20,000 yuan and is currently hovering around 160,000. As for other miscellaneous goods transactions, the scale is small and not worth mentioning.</p>
<p>Firewood, Rice, Oil, Salt, and Other Items - Constant Ups and Downs</p>
<p>Speaking of the seven necessities of life, firewood, rice, oil, and salt, the past six months have been a turbulent period that has shaken people's hearts. Among them, the rice market has been the most frightening. Guilin is only known for its chili peppers and is otherwise devoid of resources. Its rice supply mostly relies on counties in northern Guilin and Hunan rice coming south. Last year's unprecedented disasters led to no harvest in Hunan and northern Guilin, causing immense panic in Guilin. Rice merchants shouted for prices of 10,000 yuan per dan. It was not until this harvest that prices gradually declined, falling below 20,000. As long as the supply is even slightly disrupted, prices are immediately bid up. Those who manipulate and hoard include both merchants and officials, which is another lamentable situation. Currently, due to the lack of rain in May and the threat of early pests in the next crop, a famine-like situation is developing again, and prices have already returned to around 30,000, with a tendency to rise further. People are fearful and live in constant anxiety. As for firewood and cooking oil, they are also as precious as Guilin jade liquor. Cooking oil costs 115,000 per dan, and firewood costs 4,000 yuan for two bundles. The salt market is sluggish, with few people inquiring. Snow salt can be traded for 30,000.</p>
<p>Relying on Shanghai's Guidance - Foreign Goods are Popular</p>
<p>With goods in this state, what is the market like? Guilin's stores, relying on the Shanghai breeze, are now without "America" nothing is complete, with "America" everything is perfect. Anything labeled "USA," even if it's sweet potatoes or turnips, is probably not worried about being unsold. A glass raincoat costs 70,000 yuan, and people scramble for it. A glass handbag costs 45,000, and people scramble for it. Even the Women's friend (menstrual belt) from America is extremely profitable. Foreign goods are popular, and cloth and yarn are also spirited. American mercerized cotton yarn costs 7,000 yuan per foot, not to mention that Hunan white homespun is also selling firmly. Hunan yarn is priced at 35,000. Large quantities of cloth and yarn flood in from Shanghai and Guangzhou, yet demand still exceeds supply. 20-count Nanma yarn is near a peak of 3 million. At its most popular, indigo cloth was traded for 160,000. The cloth and yarn market is bustling. On the surface, it seems that people's purchasing power is extremely strong, but in the end, it's just that people are replacing their worn-out clothes from the past three or four years. Once the peak season passes, it will probably be desolate and bleak.</p>
<p>The gold market, which causes waves and mischief, rose from 80,000 to 270,000 after the foreign exchange adjustment. Since then, it has remained dormant and sluggish. Guilin has nearly 30 gold shops, and most of the power is in the hands of "Jiangxi old timers." Whether things go well or poorly, it's all up to them. Currently, the shops are deserted. Daily transactions total only ten or eight taels. Bosses lie on the counter, napping the days away. However, one qian of ornamental gold can still earn 3,000 yuan.</p>
<p>30 to 50 Million Yuan Worth of Goods - Suffering from Indigestion</p>
<p>Overall, Guilin's market is lively in its desolation, and desolate in its liveliness. Apart from the official world, no one seems to have found a good way to make a fortune. 30 to 50 million yuan worth of goods are suffering from indigestion. Occasionally, when goods are sold off at a discount, the profit, after deducting taxes and commissions, is somewhat moist. When encountering a bad month, shops have to close immediately. Few merchants here receive benefits from banks, unless they have sufficient connections and a solid foundation, which is another matter. The past month has been the peak season. Merchants come and go in a hurry, buying and selling. Stores offer preferential treatment to customers, drumming up business, which does add some liveliness. However, after 10 PM, all the houses are already closed, and the streets are deserted, leaving only dim lamps, quietly illuminating the desolate roads and the disaster victims wandering the streets. Who says merchants can truly lead Guilin out of the sorrow of severe winter?</p>
<h3 id="e172">The Misfortune of Ning Tea <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>— Nanchang Report on the 19th, Our Correspondent Liu Zao</p>
<p>Wu Ning, located in the northwestern corner of Jiangxi, has a mountainous terrain and lacks rice paddies. It is a large tea garden in Jiangxi, and the primary economic source for the people in the mountainous area. Before the war, the highest annual production of black tea was 10,000 chests, which were transported to Shanghai and resold to tea firms in England, America, Germany, and the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>The products of the Wu Ning tea area are collectively known as "Ning Tea" in Shanghai. Over the past eight years, it has suffered miserably from enemy devastation. Tea trees were cut down and used as firewood, leaving behind a desolate scene. Tea farmers were also hampered by obstructed tea sales due to difficulties of living. They had no choice but to leave large plots of land barren and change occupations. This year's output has plummeted, less than one-tenth of pre-war levels. There are currently 850 chests of new tea being transported to Shanghai. Until today, they are still stored in warehouses, and no one is interested. If this year's tea sales suffer another blow, the future of Ning Tea will inevitably collapse.</p>
<p>Those familiar with the tea industry generally say that the lives of tea farmers are even more difficult than those of rice farmers in the plains. They suffer from economic pressure and exploitation by tea merchants. Their year-round hard work barely provides enough to eat. Currently, the purchase price of the Wu Ning Tea Cooperative is 300 yuan per catty for black tea and 400 yuan per catty for green tea. After the Tea Cooperative purchases the tea, processing and manufacturing costs add up to nearly 2,000 yuan per catty. Based on the current tea market situation in Shanghai, the cost of one dan of black tea is 200,000 yuan, and the highest selling price can only reach 250,000 yuan. The 850,000 chests of Ning Tea stored in Shanghai have not attracted any interest so far due to excessive costs and low market prices. However, Ning Tea's misfortune is due to high costs on one hand and the dumping of Wenzhou tea and Taiwan tea on the other.</p>

<h3 id="e173">Between Husband and Wife <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>— Du Yun</p>
<p>In our country's old etiquette, the union of husband and wife was often due to the orders of parents and the words of matchmakers. Although there were inevitably so-called mismatched couples, there were also many who could work together harmoniously and grow old together. Nowadays, the union of husband and wife is often due to free love. Among them, many can maintain happiness, but it seems to have become commonplace for them to easily turn against each other and separate. From this perspective, the way husband and wife get along is truly not easy. The former can maintain their relationship for a long time, to some extent, due to moral concepts; the latter's quick separation and reunion is really due to selfishness. The relationship between husband and wife is the foundation of human relations and should be treated with respect. To maintain the affection between husband and wife, the following points should be noted:</p>
<p>1.  Consideration means mutual consideration. The wife should be considerate of the husband, knowing that the husband works outside, whether mentally or physically, it is still labor. After finishing work and returning home, he is naturally exhausted. The wife should give him a chance to rest and restore his tired spirit, so that the family becomes the husband's paradise. It is absolutely unacceptable for the wife to seem to increase her burden as soon as the husband enters the door, being impatient to serve him, or nagging and complaining about trivial matters. This makes the husband see the family as hell, and his love for his wife gradually cools down. The husband should also be considerate of the wife, knowing that women are weaker than men. If there are things that can reduce the wife's burden in housework, he should try his best to make them happen. So-called meticulous consideration can naturally maintain happiness. Furthermore, understanding means mutual understanding. There is no such thing as arguing over face between husband and wife. They should understand each other. The husband should explain to the wife when disagreements arise due to her lack of knowledge or physical strength. He should help her operate within his ability to give her a rest. This makes him a good husband in the wife's mind. The wife should be considerate of the husband's external social life and interactions with friends, knowing how to consider the husband's position, especially regarding household expenses, spending according to income, and not making all sorts of unreasonable demands on the husband. In this way, they can get along for a long time.</p>
<p>2.  Loyalty - Some husbands think that their wives are ignorant women and do not let their wives know anything about what is happening outside. They even keep the amount of their salary secret, which is disloyal to their wives. As a result, the wife does not know how much the husband earns and cannot estimate expenses. This alone leads to suspicion in other areas. A gap forms between the wife and the husband. The longer the gap lasts, the colder the love becomes, and the result is naturally painful. If the wife does not tell the husband the truth and acts suspiciously, it will naturally cause the husband to be unhappy. In short, a person should act with integrity, especially between husband and wife. If they get along in this way for a long time, seeing each other's character, their love will become deeper and more affectionate, and they can look forward to growing old together.</p>

<p>What is terrible is: neither being able to live with a woman, nor being able to live without a woman. - Byron</p>
<p>I have made a lifelong bond with her (or him); I have chosen. From now on, my goal is no longer to seek someone who makes me happy, but to make the person I have chosen happy. - Maurois</p>
<p>The problem of mankind lies in reconciling mystery and science, and marriage is the same. - Alain</p>
<p>Without the cooperation of the two sexes, there will be no true civilization. But without mutual acceptance of differences and mutual respect for different natures between the two sexes, there will be no true cooperation between the two sexes. - Maurois</p>
<p>A woman's nature tends toward sexual love and maternal love; a man's nature focuses on the outside world. - Maurois</p>
<p>Marriage is not a fixed thing, but something you have to do. - Maurois</p>
<p>In a happy marriage, each person should respect the other's interests and hobbies. The idea that two people can have the same thoughts, the same judgments, and the same desires is the most absurd. - Maurois</p>
<p>Marriage is an institution built on instinct, and its success requires not only physical attraction but also willpower, patience, mutual acceptance, and tolerance. Only then can a wonderful and solid emotion, love, friendship, sensuality, respect, etc., be formed, and only this is true marriage. - Maurois</p>

<p>The north wind rises again, and the climate gradually turns cold. This is the most suitable time for tonics. Therefore, all kinds of tonics rise with the wind, especially in the current market full of American goods, vitamin pills, liver extract, Paleto, and various tonic injections, etc., in various ways. Although some of them have considerable effects, there are also many that are over-hyped.</p>
<p>There is a saying in our country: "Medicinal tonics are not as good as food tonics," which is very reasonable. The West also has the saying "Buy tonics, you can go to the vegetable market to find them." In the past, there was no specific medicine for pernicious anemia. Later, a doctor accidentally discovered that fresh liver could cure patients with this disease. After much research, the main components of the liver were extracted and made into liver extract for oral administration or injection. Nowadays, general pharmaceutical factories purchase beef and pork livers from vegetable markets. Therefore, the liver, which was originally a food for the common people, immediately became an aristocratic tonic.</p>
<p>From this, it can be seen that for all nutritional diseases, the required nutrients can be obtained from certain foods to nourish the body. Medicines are only in an auxiliary position. Therefore, if we want to take tonics, we should eat more nutritious foods at every meal.</p>
<p>The following table lists several nutritious foods for housewives' reference.</p>

<h3 id="e177">The Quality of Soap <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>— Nei Jin</p>
<p>Soap can be said to be one of the most indispensable household daily necessities; however, due to the poor quality of soap, general households often suffer great losses invisibly, paying high prices but getting no good results, so this is worth paying attention to. Now, I will write down the simplest and most effective method of identifying the quality of soap for everyone to test.</p>
<p>First, dissolve a small piece of soap in pure alcohol, or heat it to dissolve it. In this way, impurities such as sand, starch, and small stones contained in the soap will not dissolve and will completely settle at the bottom; if it is a good pure soap, it must be able to dissolve completely without any precipitation.</p>
<p>Second, ordinary soaps all contain unsaponified fat, which is not very suitable, because it is not easy to make the washed items clean. The freshly cut surface of the soap can be applied to a sheet of transparent cellophane, slightly heated, and if transparent small spots are seen under sunlight, it is unsaponified fat.</p>
<p>Third, inferior soaps all contain free alkali, which not only does not make the washed items clean, but also easily makes the skin of the washer's hands feel dry and painful. Take a small amount of soap, dissolve it (add alcohol or heat), and then drip a few drops of liquid mercuric chloride (i.e., HgC12). If a yellowish-brown precipitate occurs, it proves that it contains alkali. It can also be placed in dry (or ventilated) air, and if white needle-like crystals occur, it is because there is too much free alkali.</p>
<p>Fourth, soap containing too much fat is also not good. Place a small piece of soap in dilute sulfuric acid (3 c.c.), heat it, and wait for it to cool. If too much fat is seen to condense on the top, it is also not suitable to use as it is too wasteful when washing.</p>
<h3 id="e178">A Child's Heart <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>— Han Ying</p>
<p>After reading Miss Feng's "Stepmother's Heart" in this column on November 19, I couldn't help but be touched by my own life experience.</p>
<p>My mother passed away when I was just four years old. After more than a year, I had a "new mom." Because I heard people say that "new moms" hit people, I didn't dare to approach her, but out of curiosity, I quietly leaned against the head of the bed and watched her comb her hair from afar. The new mom ignored me. After tidying up her hair, she went out of the room. This was the scene on the second day after the stepmother entered the house. At that time, the impression of this "new mom" was: maybe she won't hit me, but I also don't feel that she loves me. Later, I often heard her arguing with my father, so I felt that the new mom was scary.</p>
<p>I remember it was during the New Year when my four siblings and I went to my uncle's house. Because I had my cousins as companions, my uncle liked to tease us, and my aunt took care of our food and clothing at all times. We really felt happy. After playing for a few days, someone from home came to pick us up. What did the children know? We wanted to play happily wherever it was fun, so we hurriedly hid and encouraged my aunt to send the person back. After picking us up two or three times, we sadly went home. The strange thing was: after going back, Mom not only didn't ask us how we played at my uncle's house, whether it was fun or not, etc. When we went to greet her, she immediately darkened her face and turned away. It was like this for several days in a row, and we were also baffled. After being reminded by people at home: Mom is angry. What can we do to make Mom happy? It is said that we have to apologize to her (that is, apologize, she instructed the old maid who took care of me, telling us to do this). As a result, we were taken to her and kowtowed to her before she recovered. Since then, whenever the etiquette was not perfect, she would use this set of silent education, until we kowtowed and admitted our mistakes. Later, we liked to go to my aunt's house even more. Once we went, we never wanted to come back. Every time we had to go home, my aunt would coax and persuade us. I even blamed my aunt for asking us to go back when we were having fun. At that time, seeing my cousin acting spoiled in front of my aunt, I was amazed at his boldness and hoped that I also had a mom who would allow me to act spoiled, but once I got home, I had no courage at all. As for my father, I felt that he loved us, but apart from buying books and toys for me, he was always taciturn and solemn. Even if I had any opinions, I didn't dare to express them to him. Moreover, he was away from home for two years out of every three years. Apart from looking at my stepmother's face, all my activities were with the old servant. My stepmother sometimes also had a good face, that is, when guests came, especially in front of our uncle and aunt: "Uncle and Aunt, I have always been afraid of people saying that I can't treat the children of the former wife well. I have never hit these children, not even once. You ask them, see if I have ever hit them?" Indeed, she had never hit us, but we felt it was even more terrible than being hit. We grew up conscientiously under this kind of education. Naturally, the treatment of us and her young younger brother was completely different, and I don't need to say more.</p>
<p>I have always thought: "A stepmother's heart is like a three-inch nail, how long it is, how deep it is hammered." Whenever I heard that someone remarried, I secretly worried about his former wife and children. After reading this article, I felt that I was overthinking. I think this should be an educational problem. Women of our previous generation received very little education. Because there was a traditional old practice of stepmothers abusing the children of former wives, children inevitably feared stepmothers a little, but they still wanted to be close to "mother," just not daring to. In this state, an unreasonable stepmother would think that the children were not close to her. Just like going to uncle's house to play and not wanting to go home, that was also a natural thing. In the stepmother's heart, she would suspect that her aunt was instigating and alienating. In addition, because she had her own children, she couldn't help but favor her own flesh and blood, so she became more and more estranged from the children of the former wife, even truly opposed, creating several unfortunate events. As far as I can remember, I had no negative feelings about my stepmother in my childhood, and I really treated my stepmother as my own mother. As long as I pleased my mother, I would be willing to kowtow and apologize. My stepmother would be happy in her heart. When she was idle, she often teased me about whether she loved me or not. She said "I don't love you," and I would immediately cry. She said again "I love you," and I would immediately laugh through my tears. To her, she might be tricking this silly child to make her happy, but in my careful eyes, I thought it was really the case.</p>
<p>Seeing the child, Ming, written by Miss Feng, in that hesitant situation, reminded me of the scene when I saw my stepmother, exactly the same. It was that I wanted to be close to my new mom, but I was also afraid. If the stepmother understood this psychology of the child, she would immediately seize it, and I believe you would find him more lovely than your own biological child. Because he has a bit of inferiority complex, fearing that you won't love him, so he is most willing to accept your lessons.</p>
<p>I am already around thirty years old. Nowadays, more and more women are educated. Children of the next generation who have stepmothers may all be like Miss Feng's "Ming," which is truly a fortunate thing.</p>

<h3 id="e179">The Problem of Reproducing Works of Art <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>— Shi Chongpeng</p>
<p>The achievements of Chinese art predate those of any other country in the world. The stone carvings of the Wu Liang Shrine, the Yungang Grottoes, the Dunhuang murals, and the sculptures of the Sui and Tang dynasties, as well as the paintings of the Song and Yuan dynasties, are magnificent and exquisite, unparalleled in the world. However, for more than a thousand years, Chinese art has made no progress in technique. Not only has there been no progress, but even the ancient methods have disappeared, posing a danger of extinction and loss. As a result, the masterpieces of the past cannot be preserved, and the artistic works of the future cannot be produced. The Chinese nation, which has always been known for its art, is constantly regressing and will become a nation of low-ability people with no strengths.</p>
<p>There are, of course, many reasons for the decline of art and culture, but the government's failure to promote it and the people's lack of tools for studying art are the biggest problems. If any work of art is to progress, it must first study and understand the existing works of art, and then come up with new ideas and strive for excellence. For example, in painting, apart from the childhood years, when children should be allowed to freely express their innate creative ability, those who specialize in the study of art must imitate and refer to genuine works of famous paintings. (The techniques of learning Chinese painting and Western painting are fundamentally different.) They must study their brushwork and ink techniques, as well as their composition and structure, before they can change and create. Similarly, when learning sculpture, one must first refer to famous sculptures, study their carving techniques, and their postures and expressions, and then learn. It is not difficult to get started. Therefore, the existing famous works of art are good tools for learning art. In our poor country, with such a vast territory and such inconvenient transportation, even the most talented artists do not have the objective conditions to nurture and develop them, unless they grow up in aristocratic families (there is a Chinese saying, "If there are no ancient paintings in the hall, it is not an old family"). With a rich collection of calligraphy, paintings, and antiques, they can study them at any time. Otherwise, ordinary poor children who want to learn an art after their studies can only use woodcut mustard seed garden painting manuals and the like for imitation and reference. Beyond that, where can they see the achievements of past dynasties? Even the works of the Four Wangs and Wu Yun are not easy to see.</p>
<p>In the major cities of Europe and America, there are art galleries and museums, and there are also many art education institutions. Art lovers can freely visit and copy them. Anyone is encouraged to reproduce works of art. Moreover, thanks to the excellence of printing technology, all works of art are photographed, printed, and widely distributed, so that they can be disseminated and promoted even in remote rural areas. As a result, all art workers have access to a wealth of art reference materials. Looking around our country, in the past, the autocratic era was deeply hidden and closed. Since the Republic of China, although institutions such as the Palace Museum have been established, and in recent decades, there have also been copperplate and glass plate art prints, the results have been minimal, and there have been many restrictions. The reproduction of works of art is regarded as a patent. Not to mention the works of art in private collections, even the Palace Museum of the government has strict regulations regarding the works of art in the museum. Ten years ago, after participating in the Shanghai pre-exhibition of the London Chinese Art Exhibition, the author organized the observation notes of the painting section into a book, "Observation Notes on Famous Chinese Paintings," and submitted it to the Commercial Press for publication. A few painting illustrations were used, which aroused serious attention from the Palace Museum, with the suspicion of reprinting their secret book. Later, after the explanation by Teng Ruoqu, a counselor of the Executive Yuan, the matter was resolved. The Palace Museum holds such a view on the dissemination of works of art.</p>
<p>Recently, the Ta Kung Pao reported that 100 ancient paintings from the Palace Museum in Peiping were exhibited in Chengdu, and it was solemnly announced: "Photography and copying are prohibited during the exhibition." What is the reason for this? Why are the "photographing and copying" of ancient paintings collected by the state not allowed for the people of the country? Photography and copying are nothing more than promoting national treasures and studying art. Art museums in Europe and the United States are open to the public for copying. Why does our Palace Museum prohibit photography and copying? May I ask, if these ancient paintings from hundreds or even thousands of years ago are not openly copied and reproduced, then what scientific methods will the Palace Museum use to permanently preserve them hundreds or even thousands of years from now? How can it guarantee that they will not be naturally destroyed? At present, Chinese art is in a critical state of not advancing and retreating. It cannot be revived without the government's promotion and encouragement. Historically valuable works of art should be reproduced as much as possible, and art workers should be encouraged to copy them as much as possible. Then, these valuable works of art can be disseminated far and wide, throughout the country and the world, so that Chinese art will not be extinct or lost! I think those who are engaged in art and culture should have the same hope for the problem of reproducing works of art!</p>

<p>— Michelangelo</p>
<p>Michelangelo (B. Michelangelo-1548), along with Leonardo da Vinci and Raphael, is known as one of the three giants of the Italian Renaissance. His resolute style can be contrasted with Raphael's elegant brushstrokes. His life's work is most famous for murals and sculptures. His anatomy is accurate, and his skills are skilled. This work is a good example. (Lion)</p>
<h3 id="e181">Our Country's Art of Printmaking <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Xingwu</p>
<p>After reading "Selected Woodcuts from Eight Years of Resistance Against Japan"</p>
<p>Although art is created by human beings, it cannot be separated from reality or transcend history. Art is accumulated from history and evolved from reality.</p>
<p>If art is something that transcends reality, then art is too mysterious and meaningless to life. Winkelmann said in a dream: "Art and nature are mixed together, and it is a purely objective fact." Hegel also said: "Art is the eternal rationality manifested in things, and its characteristics are 'infinity' and 'freedom'." It can be seen that the art of "truth, goodness, and beauty" is universal in the world and permeates the universe.</p>
<p>Art cannot be separated from nature or life. This has become an eternal theorem. However, if nature and life are not captured, synthesized, and developed through art, and summarized into a systematic literature, then the various forms of society and the various elements of natural beauty can never occupy space and be passed on in time, and have an impact on human beings.</p>
<p>Our country's art of printmaking has a considerable history. It can be said that it began in the Stone Age. Many of the relics left over from that time were carved with knives, and the tools and production methods were similar to those of modern woodcuts. Many stone fragments excavated from Zhoukoudian, Hebei, are very exquisitely carved, and the contents are all records of primitive life. Since the invention of printing, Chinese printmaking has achieved even more brilliant results. For example, ancient books, unofficial histories, Buddhist scriptures, Taoist canons, novels, and various kinds of publications all have illustrations. Folk customs are also depicted in various ways. Although there have been ups and downs and evolutions of prosperity and decline in these historical artistic achievements, we have never stagnated this precious undertaking at a standstill. The current rise of printmaking art is indeed influenced by foreign works, but our nation's artistic literature has its own excellent foundation.</p>
<p>Human society cannot exist without art, just as fish cannot exist without algae. The more advanced the art, the more civilized and progressive human life becomes. Therefore, the woodcut industry has emerged in the last few decades.</p>
<p>Fifteen years ago, the woodcuts in our country were still in the hands of "artisans." They carved decorations for dowries and carved points for doors, walls, and houses. Therefore, they could not enter the halls of elegance. Mr. Lu Xun saw this and opened up a new road for the woodcut world, erected the banner of the emerging woodcut movement, enriched the woodcut publishing industry, and expanded the woodcut business, so that the woodcut business produced an artistic effect, thus transforming the social view of woodcut art. "Selected Woodcuts from Eight Years of Resistance Against Japan" is selected from the thousands of works displayed in the exhibition of woodcuts from eight years of resistance against Japan. The complete collection contains 100 works, by 75 artists. They were carved with various knives and lines, with years of experience and cultivation. These artists have organized art groups all over the country to promote the woodcut movement, such as the Wood Bell Society, the 18 Art Society, the Chun Di Painting Society, the Yefeng Painting Society, the Shanghai Painting Research Society, the Chinese Printmaking Research Society, the Tianjin Woodcut Society, the Taiyuan Woodcut Research Society, the Modern Printmaking Society, the Kaifeng Woodcut Research Society, the Nanjing Woodcut Society, the Tao Kong Painting Society, the Iron Horse Printmaking Society, the Yewei Society, the Profound Woodcut Research Society, and the All-China Woodcut Association, etc. Not only that, they also continuously cultivate like old farmers, and constantly work hard to accumulate countless works that are passed down everywhere, whether in cities or villages. During the Anti-Japanese War, their works have been exhibited in Peiping, Tianjin, Taiyuan, Jinan, Shanghai, Hankou, Chongqing, Guilin, Hangzhou, Nanjing, Chaozhou, Guangzhou and other places, and they have all achieved excellent results. Even abroad, there are their masterpieces circulating. For example, the 1936 Hungarian World Woodcut Exhibition and the 1937 World Woodcut Exhibition held by the Art Institute of Chicago in the United States, they all sent works to participate. After 1939, they sent woodcuts to England, the United States, the Soviet Union, and India for exhibitions. The emerging Chinese woodcut art appeared in Moscow, Leningrad, London, New York, and Calcutta, and won praise from all over the world. As for their publications in the past ten years, the more historically valuable ones include dozens of types such as Modern Printmaking, Woodcut World, Woodcut Journey, Wood Art, Woodcut, and Art.</p>
<p>Art can make people's psychological functions full of harmonious activities. Although it is not practical, it can enlighten mankind to move upwards and progress. The emerging woodcut movement has this mission.</p>
<p>Thanks to the guidance of the pioneers, and the continuous efforts of countless woodcut artists in the past ten years, our country's woodcut business has inherited the past and opened up the future, and has embarked on the road of revival. "Selected Woodcuts from Eight Years of Resistance Against Japan" is the crystallization of their years of hard struggle. Like warriors, they carry a woodcut weapon, from rural areas to cities, from war zones to rear areas, from home to abroad, shouldering the mission of woodcut revival. Thanks to their efforts, the motherland has greater glory in art.</p>

<p>— Tian Su</p>
<p>Poetry is the most concise language in the world, using only a few words to express meanings that are ten or a hundred times more complex than the words themselves, and it must be expressed clearly, which is by no means an easy task. Therefore, the creation of poetry is by no means accidental, but it is transmitted to the poet's pen by accidental inspiration.</p>
<h3 id="e183">The Helmsman Plus One Chapter <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>— Yang Mou</p>
<p>The Helmsman</p>
<p>Don't overestimate those huge battleships, whose master is only the full spirit of the helmsman; you also despise those small boats in the quiet rivers, they also have a helmsman working diligently.</p>
<p>Storms, huge waves, darkness, loneliness, break through it, smash it, …</p>
<p>Great helmsman. -- His life is entrusted with the lives of thousands of people, and his spirit is being tormented for thousands of people. His ultimate goal is upright, but he has to open up a winding road in those sea reef obstacles. The expression on his face may be serious, or it may be subtle and relaxed, but his heart is searching for a road without road signs.</p>
<p>Is this an ordinary job? Yes, when the ship cuts through the smooth water waves and moves forward leisurely, who can appreciate the hidden water power and reefs? The wind is blowing, the waves are rising, and the ship is tossing, which brings curses and ridicule. Who thinks that the helmsman is fighting for his life?</p>
<p>People only think about "themselves." Apart from "themselves," who is willing to think more?</p>
<p>Therefore, the helmsman's good intentions are always lonely.</p>
<p>Loneliness</p>
<p>Sometimes, I often feel lonely.</p>
<p>The whole world and laughter seem to have left me, only my own heart is beating the door of memory.</p>
<p>What pours out is sour, sweet, spicy, …</p>
<p>I am afraid of loneliness, and I am afraid of memories.</p>
<p>In the crowd, I have never discouraged myself, I have never shown weakness, and I have never been afraid. I will clench my teeth and learn from suffering. But, when emptiness often presses on me, I think, all the hard work is in vain, the world is only a garden for a few people, who can be indifferent?</p>
<p>Life is still so young, who wants to endure the suffering of loneliness? I like harmony, and I want to sing loudly with joy. The environment is like this, but I can't help but let loneliness slip into a corner of my life.</p>
<p>How to drive it away? But it always makes me wander.</p>
<h3 id="e184">Anecdotes from the Literary World <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>— Zhan Weng</p>
<p>Zhang Taiyan</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang Taiyan once chanted red beans: "The south wind is difficult to compete with the north wind, and I look forward to Wuyang every day; I always miss each other across the fields, and send you a purple sachet from afar." Those who saw it did not know its intention. Taiyan said to others, "Why are red beans a symbol of love? I don't know where it comes from. Wang Wei only said that this thing is the most missed thing, so he must explain the reason for the love. My (Taiyan refers to himself) poem uses current affairs, not classical at all." At that time, Mr. Hu Zhentang was in Guangdong, and today's Chairman Chiang Kai-shek was in the capital, and sent someone to welcome him. There were many twists and turns in the exchange of letters. Taiyan specially borrowed red beans to compare the love between the two men.</p>
<p>In his later years, Taiyan lived in Wuzhong, and his seat was often full. Taiyan was talkative and willing to discuss politics with people, but in fact, he did not know much about human affairs. Politics was not his specialty. When Taiyan ate, he did not look around, and only used chopsticks on the nearest food in front of him. Once, he had dinner at a friend's house, and the dish in front of him was very spicy. Taiyan ate it endlessly, and his forehead was sweating. The servant saw this and quickly moved the dish away, and he was relieved. The host initially suspected that Taiyan was very fond of spicy food, but then he realized the reason. He retreated and told others, and it was passed on as a joke.</p>

<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>"Well, why didn't you point at this one-eyed dragon when he forced us into the car just now?" He Jian joked with Pingzi.</p>
<p>Pingzi received this telegram and quickly retracted her jade hand, glanced at He Jian, and pursed her standard small mouth again. He Jian smiled slightly and pulled back her plain hand and placed it in his palm.</p>
<p>"Don't joke anymore," Pingzi's fingers tapped the telegraph code again. "I haven't been here long, where did I get this skill?"</p>
<p>"What is the old man doing?" He Jian sent a telegram asking.</p>
<p>"Come to save us." Pingzi showed a smug smile; "I am very worried about your health, I calculated for you, there are more than fifty hours, without formal rest! Your spirit is still strong, but you can't consume it like this……!"</p>
<p>"Thank you for your concern……I also learned 'Xuan Arts', you can never sleep, just meditate for ten minutes every one or two hours."</p>
<p>"Really? ……Who did you learn it from?"</p>
<p>"It's absolutely true, don't you see I'm still very fresh now?……This was taught by my Chinese friend Yue Jun, he is a Chinese writer, and he is also a esoteric sect, attacking people with sword energy. A hollow push with his bare hands can knock down or even kill people a hundred meters away. His master is even more powerful, he can take people's heads from the air within a hundred miles, his grand master is even more powerful……" The telegram was interrupted; because the old man and the one-eyed gentleman had finished talking and walked over from across the street.</p>
<p>"Ping'er, get out of the car," the old man opened the car door and nodded to Pingzi, "Mr. He Jian has to go!"</p>
<p>Pingzi originally held He Jian's hand tightly and refused to let go, but seeing the old man, raised his hand in a wave, Pingzi seemed to have suffered a lot of strength, as if dragged, could not help but shudder, immediately let go of his hand, and got out of the car. At this time, the old man still held the car door, let Pingzi open, and raised a hand again, as if remotely stroking He Jian's forehead, gently pressed it:</p>
<p>"Haha, Namo Bolo Om Mi Hong……!" The old man released his old voice, chanting this.</p>
<p>He Jian sat in the corner of the car, after this press and chanting, his mind suddenly became confused, as if he was about to faint, but in the blink of an eye, he felt a heat suddenly filled his dantian. This heat, from below to above, from the fur to the outside, instantly spread throughout his body, it was as if he had completely rested all night, his spirit and physical strength suddenly became strong; and it seemed as if a potential was added out of thin air, and all the troubles, fears, anxieties of the past two days, turned into nothing, and suddenly felt that the future was bright.</p>
<p>(Science has finally entered the preliminary stage of enlightenment at the end of this twentieth century. There are still these superstitious, strange and chaotic gods and ghosts talking nonsense. I am afraid that the public will see this passage and say that this record has become a myth like the "Investiture of the Gods" and "Journey to the West". However, this technique is precisely a small function of the "applied psychology" in science; that kind of acting and chanting is just a means of transmitting the spirit; using one's own cultivated spirit to transmit it to the other party, and suddenly awaken the other party, and activate the other party's potential spirit; it is as if the exhausted battery has been recharged with new electricity. This is also like a tired and exhausted army, once it hears the report of the officers that the main force of reinforcements has arrived, and with relief supplies, it can generally increase its spirit and bravely charge into the battle. It is also like modern doctors, who can perform surgery without full or partial anesthesia, just need to hypnotize once, the patient will not feel pain, this hypnosis is a way of "applied psychology". Others, such as the knife swallowing and fire walking of the Indians and Yellow Religion, etc., look like magic, but they are actually a kind of self-hypnosis method, activating their own potential spirit and ability, which is not surprising.)</p>
<p>He Jian's spirits were lifted and his heart was very stable. Watching the old man take Pingzi away, he did not talk to the one-eyed gentleman in the car, nor did he ask him where he was going; he only knew that the car traveled for more than twenty-nine minutes, turned several streets, and then stopped abruptly. At this time, He Jian was only thinking about Pingzi's trustworthy words—"Be careful of the cigarette case"—he only hoped that he would have a chance to see what Pingzi had put in the cigarette case.</p>

<p>— Shao Fu</p>
<p>According to the statistics of Tongren Fuyuantang, the number of road corpses collected in the three days from the 27th to the 29th of last month was 316, including 46 adult road corpses and 270 underage child corpses. In the 4.5 million population of Shanghai, the number of road corpses reached almost 3 per 50,000 people. This proportion cannot be said to be not shocking enough.</p>
<p>And the meteorological bureau predicts that the temperature this winter may drop to ten degrees below zero Celsius, reaching the coldest record in the history of this port (December 1927). This is a terrible report.</p>
<p>Human vitality can be called the strongest among animals. It can resist all diseases and disasters. A doctor friend told me that it is not easy to kill a person. Patients with stage III lung disease, with half of their lungs rotten, can still struggle for several years. It can be seen that unless all vitality is truly destroyed, that breath will not be interrupted.</p>
<p>Now, one hundred and five people (average calculation) are frozen to death alive in a single day. Ants still greed for life, is there any human tragedy that can surpass this?</p>
<p>Behind the red doors, wine and meat rot, and on the road, there are frozen corpses. Benevolent people, please save the vagrants on the streets of this city! Isn't it? Letting them die on the roadside, and you appreciate the street scenery in the car, isn't it too unsightly?</p>
<p>To be honest, the existence of this scene for a day only proves our barbarity and shows our shame!</p>

<p>Q: Do all member states have to comply?</p>
<p>A: Yes. Because they have all agreed to implement the decisions of the Security Council.</p>
<p>Q: Is the power of the council limited to this?</p>
<p>A: No. If the Council considers the above methods still insufficient, it may "employ land, sea and air forces to maintain peace."</p>
<p>Q: Is there any force that can be used immediately?</p>
<p>A: Yes. Countries with this obligation should be prepared to provide the Air Force for the Council's use at any time. They must also notify the Council of other sea, land and air forces they are prepared to supply.</p>
<p>Q: Will these forces become international forces?</p>
<p>A: No. The combat plan is decided by the Council and its Military Staff Committee. Unless there is a special agreement, the implementation of this plan is completed by the military forces of each country under the command of the generals of that country.</p>
<p>Q: Which countries are included in the Security Council?</p>
<p>A: Includes the five powers of China, the United States, the United Kingdom, France, and the Soviet Union, and six countries elected by the General Assembly for a term of two years.</p>
<p>Q: Can any of the five powers prevent the Security Council from discussing any issues raised by small countries?</p>
<p>A: No. The Security Council must take any decision with the full consensus of the five powers. This is because in necessary times, the five powers are responsible for implementing the decisions of the Council. The United Kingdom firmly maintains that the veto power of the five powers should not prevent the Council from discussing the issues raised.</p>
<p>Q: If any of the five powers is also involved in the discussion of a problem, does this power still have the right to vote in the Council?</p>
<p>A: Yes. Members of the Council have the right to vote on any issue - even if it involves their own issues.</p>
<p>Q: Does the trusteeship system make the trust territories never independent?</p>
<p>A: On the contrary, the Charter states that one of the main objectives of the trusteeship system is to assist the trust territories in establishing autonomous governments or complete independence.</p>
<p>Q: The Charter states: All member states undertake to cooperate in resolving international economic, social, and cultural issues. How?</p>
<p>A: The United Nations General Assembly will elect eighteen member states to form the Economic and Social Council, with members serving a three-year term.</p>
<p>Q: What is the mission of this council?</p>
<p>A: Its powers and obligations are very flexible, because this is a major experiment. There has never been such an international economic committee in history, so its progress can only be based on experience.</p>
<p>Q: What exactly does it do?</p>
<p>A: It will investigate all social and economic phenomena and make recommendations—for example, education, labor, and health are all within its scope of tasks.</p>
<p>Q: Are member states obliged to accept its recommendations?</p>
<p>A: No. This would become interference in other countries' internal affairs. However, if it makes a suggestion and a member state refuses to accept it, then the opinions everywhere will know. (End)</p>
<p>Wanted: Fleeing Wool Blanket</p>
<h3 id="e188">We Want to Investigate <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>— Ru Yan</p>
<p>Regarding the allocation of woolen blankets, various newspapers in this city have recently published opinions. Yesterday, this publication also mentioned it, but that article said: "We do not wish to investigate whether such a thing actually happened, nor how it came about..." I feel that we should investigate this matter, and immediately. Because many things in the past have become facts through rumors, which makes us unable to "dismiss our suspicions." If there were no plans to allocate them in the first place, that would be fine, but since it was said that they would be allocated, why was the allocation suddenly canceled? First, it was said that there were only ten thousand blankets, then two thousand, and finally it was said that there would be no allocation at all. Where did the woolen blankets go? What trick are they playing? We want to investigate, we want to investigate thoroughly! We want to bring the woolen blankets to justice! These past few days the wind has been so strong, the weather so cold, and the poor public employees are craning their necks, hoping for these blankets to keep warm!</p>

<p>Public employees are outraged by the news that military blankets have been discontinued. The writer would like to defend the responsible authorities: You have often expressed dissatisfaction in the newspapers about the distribution of American goods hindering the production and sales of domestic goods. Now, as you wished, the items bought from foreigners will be resold to foreigners (Jews).</p>

<p>— Suo Bei</p>
<p>After the news of the discontinuation of woolen blankets was released, public employees were deeply indignant, but the Materials Supply Bureau did not explain the reasons, and even brazenly acknowledged "changing the decision midway and selling them at high prices." This kind of frankness is rare, but it still makes people feel: "The skin is too thick," just like what a certain store's advertisement says: "The world is very different now, first let the old face prove it."</p>
<p>What is even more admirable is that the responsible authorities are also silent, "acting as if nothing happened"; to put it bluntly, what more can be said about this kind of "not needing face"?</p>

<p>People: Hateful!</p>
<p>Chairman: Should we fight them or not?</p>
<p>People: We should fight!</p>
<p>Chairman: Since everyone says we should fight, then let us organize a militia and give those warmongering stubborn elements a righteous blow before they come. Let us organize!</p>
<p>People: ...</p>
<p>Chairman: Remember: Not participating in the militia means not loving peace, and not loving peace means wanting civil war. So not participating in the militia is the initiator of civil war, and we cannot let him exist in our peace-loving society...</p>

<h3 id="e192">Zhang Ji, Who Dares to Be Angry and Speak Out <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>— Ren Fan</p>
<p>Perhaps, you may be surprised that since the National Revolution unified the country and established its capital in Nanjing, we don't seem to hear much news about Zhang Ji Guang-sheng! Yes, he hasn't held an administrative office for twenty years, but if you review the historical records of the Republic of China's revolution, Mr. Zhang's history and achievements in the country are extraordinary. He often calls himself: "I am a complete 'thug'." In the thirtieth year of Guangxu, this "thug" was arrested in Shanghai for the Wan Fuhua assassination of Wang Zhi-chun case. During the Second Revolution, he was again labeled by Yuan Shikai as a "rebellious element" and ordered to be wanted, fleeing to Japan. Later, during the divided situation of the Republic of China, Mr. Zhang was busy running around for national affairs, wearing a faded robe, a blue mandarin jacket, and a hat, going east to make contact and west to mediate. Everyone knows that Zhang Pu-lao (Zhang's style name is Puquan) is a very responsible person.</p>
<p>Zhang Pu-lao is from Cangxian, Hebei. He has a stout body, is strong, and has an extraordinarily straightforward temper. When there are problems in politics, as long as reporters can find him, he will talk about everything, and his words will be frank and vivid. When foreign countries coveted our country, Pu-lao was one of the most vehement advocates of resistance. I still remember that during the Fourth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang held in Beijing in the 25th year of the Republic of China, Mr. Zhang publicly rebuked the then Ministry of Foreign Affairs' policy of appeasement, his tone and expression were stern, making Minister Zhang blush. After the meeting, Zhang Qun resigned because of this, and the name of the "thug" who dared to speak out became well-known throughout the country.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang is the most trusted comrade of Mr. Sun Yat-sen. He, along with the late Chairman Lin Sen, Wu Zhihui, and Zhang Jingjiang, were known as the "Four Elders of the Party and State." He is frugal and upright, so although he is an elder of the party and state, he is still a scholar with empty sleeves. Didn't you see the advertisement for "Zhang Ji's Calligraphy" in the newspaper not long ago? - Mr. Zhang's cursive script is quite elegant and forceful.</p>
<p>People engaged in politics seem to inevitably enter the newspaper industry first. Mr. Zhang was an advisor to the Shibao newspaper in the twenty-ninth year of Guangxu. Later, it seems that he also ran a newspaper. Now he is still the chairman of the board of the China Journalism College!</p>

<h3 id="e193">Beggars' Organization 5 <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>— Huang Jiamo</p>
<p>Getting Leftovers Is Not Easy</p>
<p>However, boxed meals, as a means of maintaining cost, their supply of rice is almost just enough, even leaving nothing left after eating. This makes the beggars on the road watch the empty buckets pass by, and they can only swallow their tears of hunger. After learning this lesson, the beggar gangs know that they cannot rely solely on brute force to intercept them, so they painfully pay the cooks of the rice shops as a movement fee. They must ensure that each meal adds more rice, so that the amount of leftovers is considerable and enough to satisfy their hunger. This tribute fee is paid monthly or quarterly, and is paid by the gang's "grand uncles". After the shopkeepers are bribed, the beggars are spared the suffering of hunger. As for the areas where they抢飯（the process of getting leftovers from restaurants), there are regulations, and they cannot invade other territories casually and cause disputes. Moreover, stealing food is done by the younger members, and beggars from outside have no chance to interfere.</p>
<p>"Nailing the Road" and Herding Pigs</p>
<p>"Nailing the Road" is a new begging method invented by the "Old Brothers" beggar gang. It is truly "only one of its kind, with no branches." These people roam the streets, and when they see a fat and fair-skinned respectable person walking by, they immediately intend to follow and beg. People on the road cannot help but become anxious, so they take big steps and walk straight ahead, hoping to escape the pursuit of the beggars. But the beggars "nail" them and refuse to let go. Insiders call this "herding pigs." The fat person is the "pig," and the "pig" automatically walks faster, while the beggars chase after them, and the situation is indeed somewhat like herding. Their use of words is so evil, it is truly extremely hateful!</p>
<p>In the past, those so-called upright beggar gangs never had the rule of following passersby to beg for money. No old brand beggar gang would condescend to do this. But the "Old Brothers" have always considered themselves reformers and did not hesitate to set this bad precedent in Shanghai. This makes it troublesome for people on the road to be attacked by hateful beggars at any time, and it is impossible to send them away without giving them money. If young men and women are walking arm in arm, they are especially considered the most ideal targets by the beggars. Because this is enough to disturb their loving conversation, and if they open up a quick pace because of this, it would be too embarrassing. The smartest way is to reluctantly give them money to send them away. But if other wandering beggars catch a glimpse of this, they will still follow because "there is an example to follow," and you have to spend money again.</p>
<p>The beggars engaged in "nailing the road" are mostly young and addicted to opium. Therefore, although their income is considerable, they are always scantily clad and disgusting. The only way to deal with these people is to cross the street or quickly turn and walk into another cross street. They have no choice but to admit their bad luck. Because "nailing the road" has fixed areas. And because there are many brothers, they have to divide the roads with each other. Each person can only beg on one side of the road. For example, A is on the south side of the street, B is on the north side of the street, C is on the horizontal road in the morning, D is on the horizontal road in the afternoon, and E and F are on the vertical road. Day and night shifts take turns, and they do not interfere with each other. This work of calling the roll is determined by the "grand uncles" of each area. The richness and poverty of each road are different, and a portion of the money earned must be paid to those "grand uncles" who "receive salaries".</p>

<h3 id="e194">Better to Have None Than Bad <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>— Lan Ge</p>
<p>Let's Talk About Giving Birth to Sons and Daughters</p>
<p>According to a Reuters report on the 28th, an opinion poll was conducted by officials in Paris, and the result was that three children in each family was considered the most ideal. Although there are also those who want to have six or more children or those who do not want to have a family at all, they are always very few.</p>
<p>French women, especially Parisian women, have never liked having children. After this war, it is probably because they felt the "shortage of people," so they are trying their best to encourage fertility.</p>
<p>But Chinese people have always liked to have children and are the best at having children. Generally speaking, the so-called marrying a wife or marrying a husband is, to be honest, for the purpose of having children. The Chinese saying: "There are three unfilial acts, and having no offspring is the greatest," is enough to prove his purpose. As for the saying "raising children to guard against old age," it is even more enough to prove that the Chinese regard children as property.</p>
<p>Therefore, the more children, the better. The more there are, the more it can show that they have fulfilled their "filial piety" and have property. If their wife does not give birth to a single child, the husband can grandly remarry a concubine. As for women, they can only secretly blame themselves for not being up to par, or they will inquire about secret recipes or buy ready-made "gynecological remedies" to eat, so that they can have children.</p>
<p>In this way, Chinese children are finally born, and there are many of them. But they only know how to "give birth," and they have never studied how to "raise" them after they are born. At most, they can let them learn a few English letters or write a family letter in the so-called "school," which is enough. As for how to make children tend towards becoming complete "humans," they don't care.</p>
<p>The future of China is in the hands of these children, so it is dangerous. Therefore, I believe that rather than raising so many children who are only allowed to be born and eat and die, it is better not to give birth for the time being. There is no need to have so many even if we do give birth. If we feel a "shortage of people" in the future, it will not be too late for the government to enact laws to encourage fertility, just like France. At that time, I think the children raised can be "of use".</p>
<p>Children, we should not worry about having too few, but about having too many useless ones.</p>
