<h3 id="c1">白魯德由京飛抵平　商洽增派東北小組　即付長春展開調處大會 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>〔本報北平十六日電〕軍調部政府委員鄭介民與白魯德德將軍，十六日下午六時由京返抵北平，白魯德在平稍事停留，與執行部商恰增派東北小組事畢，即飛瀋轉往長春。政府委員鄭介民之返平，顯示執行部之工作駁近可再趨積極。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十六日電〕北平軍事調處執行部長春前進分部美代表白魯德將軍，十六日下午偕中共小組代表李敏然。王首道飛平，聞李敏然即赴瀋陽，與前進分部中共代表饒漱石晤面從，再與饒同往長春工作，李係於本月九日由延安隨周恩來同機來京、爲中共小組代表中之有力份子、此次山延來京轉長，其使命至爲重要。又據白魯德將軍行前語記者，昨日簽定之東北停戰調處協定，其附件確已載明，停戰協定之有效期間，至本月廿二日中午十二時終止，限期已近，故渠至長春後，將立刻召集雙方代表會議，按照旣定方針，分組（八祖）出發，展開調處工作，希望由此短期停戰，成工永久休戰。</p>
<p>〔聯合社南京十六日電〕今日雖係星期假日，馬歇爾特使夜間仍與周恩來晤談。</p>
<h3 id="c2">恢複交通問題　雙方意見已漸接近 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>〔本報南京十六日電〕東北停戰辦法簽定後，恢復交通問題，已爲今日商談中心。據悉：雙方意見已漸見接近，對拆除碉堡一點，政府雖已作極大讓步，惟對保護橋樑，水塔等交通性之碉堡，乃屬護路應有之警衛必須設施，應不在拆除之列。至於鐵道管理，乃爲專門技術問題·此間一般有識人士咸認。將來修復各段，爲行效率計，仍由各鐵路售時員工接管最爲合宜，因事實上中共亦缺乏甚多技術人材參加管理工作。至現在共軍佔領區內，已經中共雇用之鐵道交通管理人員，其學識足以勝任者，不妨由中共推薦交通當局繼續錄用。據今晚消息，有關恢復交通一事，如行政之必須完整，用人之必須適宜，馬使與我政府之意見均不謀而合，蓋爲交通完全計，鐵路不可割據，用人不能兒戲。如隴　海東段火廟以東共軍所派之鐵路管理局長爲一搬運夫，此種用人方針，自非所宜也。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十六日電〕平軍調部交通管理科長，今午聞曾邀宴政府及中共雙方商談恢復交通之負責人，下午並續作商談。據接近馬使者談，雙方對拆除碉堡，統一管理兩問題，政府已作最大讓步，如中共對參加管理不作政治性要求，可望迅獲協議，開始修復工程，以拯救黃河南北千萬以上之難民。</p>

<p>中宣部發言人談話</p>
<p>〔中央社南京十一六日電）中宣部發發言人答記者』詢問，和平談判情形，稱：政府竭力謀求和平，近日提出各種方案，均十分具體，甚至涉及細節，而共方每多龍統模稜，由於馬帥及其幹部辛勤之努力，許多方案均已超過再稿之階段，政府退讓坦白，已有事實表現，深望共方亦出以　一之精神。關於軍事情形，共方近日宣傳，殊令人痛心憤慨，共軍在山東津浦，膠濟兩鐵路沿綫全面進攻，佔據各重要城市，而共方宣傳則今日曰係出於自衛，明日曰係出於報復，詢問自衛，報復　何至佔領兩路沿綫一切重要城鎭，更何至共　侵人濟南·靑島市郊。爾路沿綫重要城市，中外皆知其被共軍於六月七日以後攻佔，亦衆目所睹，何得明目張　，顚倒是非，一至於此，詳細情形，已由國防部發表，茲不贅述。蔣主席對和平談判，可謂不吝一切努力，每日均召集高級幕僚，詳硏具體方案，務使其入情人理，切實有效。對於共方之延宕空洞工甚至其破壞協定之軍事攻擊，已迷容忍之極端，求有益大同，有裨和平，無不堅定一忍耐，惟共方到處攻城略地，擾亂治安，國軍則不能不出於正當防衛，以保土　民，此則政府職責所在，不容疏忽，深盼共方切實反省，勿視破壞和平之責任。</p>

<p>上次外長會議不歡而散，到此次重開，相隔雖只有一個月，但英美與蘇聯之間的關係，在前幾天似乎不但沒有好轉，釋嫌言歡，而且每况愈下，雙方芥蒂愈結愈深。例如在美國方面：（一）似不願貸款輿波蘭；（二）對於羅馬尼亞局勢，提出抗議；（三）對於南斯拉夫前陸軍長米哈洛維區將軍被控一案，出面干涉；（四）德國往來於多瑙河上的商船隊，被美軍扣留；（五）依照波茨坦協定，規定德國應以某種工業設備作爲賠償之用，美軍當局下令停止搬運。凡此，在蘇聯看來，不啻芒刺在背，而蘇聯本身也有許多不友好行動！（一）與其勢力範圍以內所有各國，增强其密切關係，蘇波條約的簽字，即可證明；（一一）南斯拉夫元首狄托將軍，最近又訪問莫斯科；（三）丹麥亦有向東發展對外貿易之趨勢；（四）最近又有蘇聯軍隊自奧地利開往德國；（五）英國舉行勝利閱兵典禮，蘇聯波蘭及南斯拉夫三國軍隊均未參加。這些事在英美看來，也覺得蘇聯向外擴張的政策，漫無止境。在這一個月內，雙方譴責，愈演愈烈，雖其發言人都是懂得國際禮貌的外交家，但在對駡的時候，也竟會坦白直爽，把外交詞令一齊拋到九霄雲外。此外，再加以法義兩國普選的結果，天主敎黨在西歐各國的勢力，益見膨脹，舉世矚目的「西歐集團」，似將由醞釀而至成熟的階段，這都是「分」的趨勢，對於企求「合」的外長會議自有若干不良的影響。</p>
<p>在外長會議重開的一天，便討論到整個議事日程，當經決定，將對義大利，芬蘭，羅馬尼亞，保加利亞，匈牙利五國媾和條約曁德國問題，均列入議程內，但對於奧地利問題及義大利國內局勢，英美與蘇聯意見，各不相同，幸得法國外長比杜爾的調處，始能成立妥協辦法，就是至外長會議結束時，將奧國問題作一概括之討論，然後再討論義大利國內政局問題，但義大利局勢如若發生重大變化，亦得提前討論。雙方成見之深，態度之堅，亦可見一斑。從這一個角度看去，四國外長會議的前途，似仍不容過分樂觀。但以今日的國際形勢而論，不論從那一方面去觀察，人們都盼望「合」而不願見「分」的。世界之「分」「合」，固繫於此會，但如果眞正演變到「分」，人類將無異自求毁滅！然而，究竟怎樣才能使英美與蘇聯通力合作呢？又這樣始能使歐洲不分裂爲束西兩集團呢？怎樣使世界不分裂爲二而使人類用原子彈等等武器互相火迸呢？</p>
<p>莫洛托夫向眞理報記者宣佈蘇聯外交政策並答覆貝爾納斯的譴責時，曾指摘美國採取强權政策·謂其大施其「原子外交」的手段威脅蘇聯。由此可知美蘇不能合作的癥結，還在美國不肯將原子能的秘密公開出來，使蘇聯感到「惴惴不安」。不得不向外擴張其「友好圈」，以謀得其所覺爲可靠的安全保障。然則原子能的問題不解決，蘇聯對美的猜忌似無法消除。</p>
<p>昨據紐約電，聯合國原子能委員會開會，美國代表巴魯樞提出非常重要的建議，主張將原子能交國際機構管制，並代表美國聲明，國際原子能機構如能成立，願將所有原子炸彈交出銷毁並不再製造。又英國原子能專家在北明翰開會，也表示贊成美國建議，並盼望國際管制原子能之議，早日見諸事實。這一陣春風吹到巴黎之後，當能使懷疑猜忌的外長會議，頓時顯出一片祥和光明。「山窮水盡疑無路，柳暗花明又一村！」我們希望四强即能抓住時機，彼此掬誠商討，則戾氣全消，和平必有把握。我們特別提出一個願望，就是：美國旣願將原子能交國際機構愼重管制，消弭彼此間的疑懼，蘇聯也可不必再斤斤打算小範圍內「安全地帶」的擴充，而加入共同防止德日再起的二十五年同盟。大家都應該知道，和平爲不可分割，惟有聯合國的集體安全，亦惟有全世界的整個安全，才是大家眞正的安全。苟能如是，則四國外長會議縱有爭論，也都可迎刃而解。所以美國公開原子能的秘密與蘇聯放棄其「安全地帶」的狹隘觀念，實爲四國外長會議成功的先决條件，而對敵擬訂和約草案等等，尙爲較小的枝節問題了。</p>

<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦十五日電〕四國外長於本日午後三時（格林威治標準時間）舉行會議，首由法外長皮杜爾致歡迎詞，希望此種有益之工作，能完成合作精神充沛之會議。旋向英美蘇三國外長致謝，各該國外長亦向之答謝。</p>

<p>關於議事日程，四國外長決定上次會議議程所列各項間題，均皆列入此次會議議程，即對義大利·芬蘭·羅馬尼亞·保加利亞·匈牙利五國媾和條約，及德國問題　。至　國問題及義大利內國局勢，擬留待會議末期始行討論。美國務卿貝爾納斯提議，對奧地利媾和問題亦應列入，蘇外長莫洛托夫提出異議多項，略謂議程所包括之事項爲數已多，不必加人此項問題。法外長皮杜爾出面調處，建議折衷辦法，即對奧媾和問題不必列入議程，但會議結束時，應就此一問題作概括之討論。至是莫洛托夫提出主張義大利內國局勢亦須提須討論，緣依照一九四三年之停戰協定，盟國曾經保證所有法西斯主義餘孽必須予以根除，依照一九四六年五月十六日之議定書，盟國亦有監視義大利內政發展之權利，最近該國發生紛擾，法西斯餘孽與新法西斯份子四出活動，其後患甚爲可意云。此項主張經討論甚久，始商獲同意，決定在奧　　問題提付討論之後。此次曾　宣吿結束之際，再行對論一義國內政問題，但義大利政局如果發生重大變化，四國外長亦得提前予以討論。關於義大利經濟問題，莫洛托夫亦主提付討論，幷要求義大利政府就未來和約之經濟條款陳述意見。英外相貝文當即提出異議，略謂：二十一國和平會議尚未召集，未能向之微取意屬不合邏輯。莫洛托夫亦即答稱：上次外長會議討論邊界問題時，業已徵取義國政府意見，已有先例云。但莫洛托夫卒亦撤消上項提議，四國外長會議乃於五時四十分休會，延至本月十七日午後三時繼續開會。</p>

<p>僑胞匯款緩不濟急</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕記者昨訪留美六十年，最近來滬之華僑領袖參政員司徒美堂，此公年已八十，而精神瞿鑠，身體極健，承吿：回國最深印象，即爲上海之生活程度太高，平民不易維持生活。以前租界時代，頗注意公共衛生，以後深望本市工務局衛生局方面，仍加努力。美國目前生活費用，平均較上海低五六倍，而美國工人所獲工資，實尙較尚前中國工人所得爲高。若以交通費用而論，則在中國更遠較美國爲昻，民生困苦，自所必然。方今最要之圖，即爲各黨各派，眞誠合作，務須停止內戰，早求和平實現，爲民族福利，俾新中國得早建設。中國於八年苦鬥之後，固己不畏列强瓜分我國，而最可怕者，乃中國人竟自欲瓜分中國也！實令海外華僑，不勝憂慮。現美國商界與若干華僑，鑒於當前中國內戰情形，雖有投資之心，輒復裏足不前，即因處此局面，實無充份保陣之故。</p>
<p>不堪回首話當年</p>
<p>本人於六十餘年前至美，尚蓄髮辮，飽受侮弄，民國成立之後，對華僑待遇已稍改善，而此次抗戰八年，美人對我國之不畏艱危，堅忍抗戰，極爲敬佩，對僑胞益增景慕之心，本人爲協助抗戰，在美主持「籌餉會」，美人之捐款者亦頗踴躍。抗戰期內，最痛心者，即爲僑滙一事。僑胞自美滙款歸國，美金五元，祇値法幣百元，其後雖增至美金一元易法幣五百，而實際上若在外國銀行滙兌，價格則可以美金一元易國幣工餘元，僑胞吃虧極大，而交款於五國銀行後，不意滙至台山新會開平等處之款，竟有事隔數年，迄未匯到者，僑胞家屬，因接濟斷絕，餓死者比比皆是，實令海外　人，欲哭無淚！</p>
<p>復興洪門·共謀發展</p>
<p>此次回國，不特欲一瞻勝利風光，亦欲謀洪門之加强。本人爲洪門致公黨總部主席，美國華僑之中，大半皆爲洪門弟兄，洪門過去，爲民族為國家，皆有極大貢獻，犧牲無數頭顱，耗費無數金錢，助成辛亥奇功，而民國建立之後，功成身退不再與聞國事。不意今日國家乃至如此民不聊生之地步！此次復興洪門，即欲團結弟兄，共負建設重任，增加生產力量，使人民均得安居樂業。然安居樂業之前提，即爲人人均能於衣食住皆有保陣。生活問題若能解決，即易納入正軌也。按司徒先生名羨，字美堂，廣東開平人，十四歲時即往舊金山，十七歲即加入洪鬥致公堂，急公好義，極爲全美華僑所推祟。早年資助總理，反對陳烱明，建功極偉，抗戰後主持籌餉會，源源接濟祖國，成績爲華僑中最優者。三十一年，曾奉政府之命，宣慰全美華僑，備受歡迎，最近為籌備致公黨大會回國，目前會晋京謁見主席，主席親予接見，極加慰勉。</p>

<p>也許你不需要每天晚上十二點以後在街上走，可是有許許多多的上海人，在這八九年來並沒習慣了早睡早起，况且，偶而逢到什麽應酬宴會，緊急事情，想在馬路上行而不得，總覺得有些不方便。</p>
<p>前三四天正在報上看到「宵禁暫不予撤消」，那知隔了二天，一聲「令」下，這「夜」了多年的「不夜城」，又開始復活了。我不敢說這是「喜訊」或是「福音」，但至少是一件便利市民的事，尤其使吃報館飯的人，可以少擔不少心事。</p>
<p>一半爲了好奇心，一半也是爲了車子一路送人乘便的關係，特地在宵禁取消後第一夜的馬路上，巡視一週。東到提籃僑，南到小西門，再繞南京路到海格路，又經霞飛路觀光一番，結果證明了這「不夜城」確是在復活了，雖然還是在開始時期。</p>
<p>大槪是因爲星期六的緣故，外灘特別熱閙，美國水兵們三三兩兩滿「醉」而歸，三輪車雖然空了，依舊可以找到主顧踏到西面去，外灘碼頭旁擴吾機中的報告聲音和四週的燈光顯得格外地「響」和「亮」，這一路熱鬧場面，因此一直影響到提籃橋；以前這時，虹口一帶早已靜若深谷，現在也居然人聲喧鬧，不斷聽到「三輪車要吧？」「黃包車要吧？」</p>
<p>走進南市，也利前一晚大不相同了，除了原來每戶門口一盞燈外，許多吃食舖子還敞開大門，無綫電裏「慈母心」的歌聲，在一百五十米外都可以聽到。</p>
<p>再跑到市區裏，馬路上的撤攤比白天還要多，尤其在橫馬路上或轉角處，燈光四射，簡直叫人睜不開眼睛，水菓攤上一只花旗桔子，遠遠地看去，顏色分外鮮艷、餛飩擔的老闆不必再敲起凄凉的竹棒找尋主顧了；冷麺攤前坐滿了主客，大有應接不暇之勢，冷飲攤老闆娘，白天忙了一天，晚上還要大量推銷桔子水。不過那些舖十裏的夥計們，這時可得淸閒一下了，找了隔壁鄰舍，搬幾只板櫈蹺起了腿，談談山海經，乘乘風凉，大有逍遙自得之意。</p>
<p>南京路上當然不必說了，平時可以開足了馬達，疾馳而過的西藏路南京路，解禁後，立刻與旺起來，車子開到十字路口，還得停上一二分鐘，才得過去。仙樂舞廳門前車夫們爲了搶生意，還可以打打架，各人們跚跚步出，似乎嫌它不該太早打烊的樣子。</p>
<p>比較起來，那詩意的霞飛路，究竟不失其本來面目，車輛少得多，餛純麵主人無從表演拿手傑作，行人們也寥寥，但偶而也可以發現幾對愛好月下踏蟻的靑年們，不知是歸家，還是剛出門！</p>
<p>解禁後，最倒霉的，還是警察，槍桿子掮得高高地，還得踱來踱表。除了他們之外，美國海陸軍憲兵們，比以前更加賣力，東也一輛吉普車，西也一輛吉普軍，而且不停則已，一停必在路中心，拿起了電筒檢査每一輛走過的吉普，緊張非凡。</p>
<p>沒有疑問的，過幾天，在夜半人靜的時候，你不妨到馬路上蹓躂一番，一定可以聽到雀戰聲四起，還能欣賞欣賞美妙音樂。誰說上海不景氣，上海人的新花樣早已準備就緒，不久的將來，你可以看到上海的深夜，比八年前格外地繁榮（邁天）</p>

<p>— 羅洪</p>
<p>當你還穿　柔軟的睡衣，帶了一副睡態站到窗子面前，對着淸晨明朗的天空，吸着新鮮的空氣，看一片兩片薄雲懶散地飄浮過去，或者　着三五成羣的小鳥翩翩地在晨風裏飛過，那眞是再安閒不過的事了。如果從睡夢中醒來，在窗帘的隙縫裏望到一塊槐蔚藍的大，聽着遠處送來隱的可聞的市聲，便伸手到枕邊拿起一本愛好的書看，或是無賴地哼起一個愛好的歌曲，那又是多麼撩人情趣的光景！</p>
<p>然而像我們那麽載着生活的重負的，那裏會有這樣悠閒的日子？給生活擠着，往往壓得人喘不過氣來。抗戰期間，在内地許多小城市裏，看見那些贏瘦的馬。馱着過重的物件，走着漫長的路程，它們低垂着頭，默默地忍受着重負。據說這種贏馬是專運貨物的。假如比擬起來，人又何嘗跟這些可憐的瘦馬不同呢？爲生活，我們載的重負實在也不算輕便的了。每天，祇是安排着把日子快快打發過去，讓生活的重担負載，把自己在生的巨輪之下搾壓着。到傍晚時候，才給自己鬆一口氣，懶散地坐到我的椅子裏，看着遠遠的拾晚風吹拂的樹枝，看看掛在牆角上的夕陽，任性地吸幾口安適的空氣，一切希望的夢，也在這時候飄浮起來，對於生活的重負，得到一點聊以自嘲的慰藉。</p>
<p>所以在任何季節裏，我常常最愛傍晚的，而且我更愛夏天和秋天的傍晚。夏犬的傍晚，眞是特別的美麗，牠是那麽地使人覺得凉爽和絢麗。你如果穿一件輕便的薄衣，站在樹蔭下面，或是短籬傍邊，給一陣陣晚風玩弄着短髮和衣角，那是比較坐到咖啡館裏吃刨冰要凉快多了。而且碧藍的天空，給夕陽渲染得頗爲塊麗的雲霞，呌人看着更有一種輕柔的快感。</p>
<p>過去幾年流亡的生活，難得有一個地方能住上一年半年，往往是白天趕路，給顚簸的公路汽車震得頭腦發昏，或者帆船一艘，悶得一整天祇想瞌睡，於是傍晚歇在一個地方，我們洗去了塵土，讓倦怠的身子浴在夕陽裏散步，　堅新各地不同的暮色，，就算是生活上唯一的享受了。也許因爲這個緣故，使我對於傍晚格外感覺到親切。</p>
<p>我也愛秋天的傍晚，牠那種恬靜的風姿，以及略有悲凉的氣氛，那麼地使人容勿想到過去，悠然地浮起許多憧憬來。人生是多麽飄渺不可思議啊，一個執着於生活，不願意輕易向生活低頭的人，也往往容易對什麽都感到失望。這種失望不一定使人消極，使人負氣憎恨，却很可能地會使一個人沉默下來，而在心上浮起許多憧憬的。像我這樣在生活上到處不自在的人，當然衹有對着恬靜的暮色，低訴衷曲的份兒。所以往往在一天的疲累之後，我坐在我★的椅子裏，噓了一口氣，彷彿把一天的煩惱都吹去了似的，默默地望着傍晚的天空，　飛烏成羣地在我窗前斜掠過去。</p>

<p>— 趙清閣</p>
<p>新年　限過去了，小紅的新生活也跟　開始了，如今她操作一切，燒飯，洗衣服，做針綫，帶孩子——哄老闆娘的寳貝兒子玩兒。但她毫無怨言，她把這一切，視爲自已分内的事，她應該勞動。在這個家裏她已經和所有的人混熟了，只有一個廖棟——她的未來的丈夫，還不熟；而且陌生得利害，每天幾乎看不見他。偶然碰到，廖棟像沒有她這個人一樣，毫無半點表示！就別再想搭上腔說句話了。因此小紅想着：「爲什麼他不理我呢？」怪納悶！可也不便去問廖楝。有幾次她看見廖棟的衣服　了，她預備呌他脫下來好替他洗洗，但她張不開口！一則怕難爲情，二則怕廖棟怪她實昧。小小的心裏，時刻都在　着這位陌路人似的未嬌夫。</p>
<p>現在園春堂已經履仃緊縮了，舖子裏只剩下實鈴和一位創製藥劑的李師父。因此他們一個人要做幾個人的活兒，雖然生意依然蕭條，而事體並不太少。賓鈴甚而變成了打雜的，除了記賬以外，有顧客買藥時，由李師父秤好分量後，他担任包的工作。每天還要擦桌子，掃地。甚而老闆娘不斷支使他去跑跑腿，當當「聽用」，（麻將牌名）從早到晚一點空沒有，這些寳鈴都忍了！因爲他的目的是要「自立耕生」，靠自己的勞力混飯吃，這不是什麼恥辱，他甘願受苦，這是鍛鍊！他這樣想。做小紅一樣，毫無怨尤。有時　棟看不過了，便帮他作點什慶，但是寳鈴常常拒絕。他吿訴廖棟：「吃得了苦的人，才能够獨立，才能够走路不怕摔筋斗。」話是這慶講，心裏却很難過！他難過的是：如果　老爺多活幾年，他可以多念幾年實，那麽他的出路也就比較寬了，他不致於非幹這種苦差事不可。而如今，他只能替人家作苦工，也可以說是替人家當奴隸！牛馬！</p>
<p>老天「助舛爲虐」，跟窮苦人作對，一個冬天都不太冷，突然春寒像猛虎一樣聲色俱厲地扑到了荆州！一塲大雪之後，屋裏就會結冰。西北風刮到臉上，似小刀子般划得你痛不可支。人的耳朶凍成了紅腫的爛橘子，人的手脚凍成了木頭；鼻涕流下來，過一會不揩乾牠便會凍成了兩條琉璃棍兒；搭拉在上唇。但這只是對於有些人是如此的嚴　，有些人却滿不在乎。因爲他們可以出門穿上皮襖，在家烘着火盆，寒冷旣侵不進他們的身體，於是他們也就不會想到那些冰天雪地受　人，是如何在受着威脅！譬如老闆娘，她穿着羊皮襖，屋裏烘着火盆。她自己便像一股熱流，她走到你的身邊時，你會感到溫暖。儘管她的心，冷酷得使你顫慄！</p>
<p>老闆娘近來又恢復了她的常態，（不高典，發怒是她的常態；快活，和平，是她的變態。）除了廖老闆與廖棟以外，這個家的大大小小，又都在她的眼裏，變成了非人的動物。尤其是對小紅，她不但已忘記了　將是這倘家的未來的長子媳婦；而且忘記了她是一個有血有肉的人！客氣優待的短暫階段已經過去了，如今從早到晚，老　娘都不能讓小紅手脚停閒一會兒。</p>

<p>小學生衛生訓練問題</p>
<p>小學課程裏面，應增設衛生一科，我們不要存有什麼奢望，祇一要兒童能懂得一點衛生上最低的基本知識，而保持個人身體上的健康就够了，這種科學教材的配置，可依照教材編制的循環法（圓周法）而分初·中·高三　爲初·中·高三個階段。每一階段仍照教科書的分配，爲一·二·三·四冊，由易人難使兒童的　生知　由淺而入深，而再入更深，毫無心理上的困難，面取得他們能保持自身健康的最後目的，最後終點，這樣才不失教育的意一義。（樊家桂·卅五·六·十三〇）</p>
<p>衛生這一類敎訓色彩濃厚的科目，兒童根本感不到興趣，如果實施訓練，反而養成兒童「　惡的心理。本人主張國語科的故事方面，影樂科的歌詞方面，以及美爾科的　賞書方面，儘量穿　關於衛生這一類敎村，在無形中灌輸給兒童，比較容易增加敎學效率。（施德邦·卅五·六·十三。於安慶。）</p>
<p>衛生訓練　目，多至一百三十五條，確嫌煩瑣。實在的，一個小學校的全體學生，能够個個做到「整齊」「淸潔」兩項基本衛生就得了。簡而易舉，事半功倍，請敎育當局從這簡易一方面着手。（楊留靑。卅五·六·十四·於杭州。）</p>

<h3 id="c111">老太爺的悲劇　（小說）　（上） <a href="#c111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>— 田禽</p>
<p>老太爺在沒有當老太爺以前，他有一個很體面的兒子，雖然一沒有讀過多少書，但記賬，或代寫些賣契，當契，以及借帖，…這些與農民們發生着密切關係的　身契似的玩意兒，他都寫得來。所以，不但他的父親，不，我們還是呌他老太爺吧。說他兒子有出息，就連全村的叔父火爺們也都這樣　讀着。老太爺有了這樣一個兒子當然是喜不自盡了。</p>
<p>可是，老太爺並沒有什麽「家當」，甚至老伴去世以後，他連個「後婚」他沒有能力續上。他的家當就是他那唯一的兒子—四代。</p>
<p>老太爺整天帶着兒子下地，一終年在土裏爬（袍）食兒吃。可是，一個窮無立錐之地的人戶，任憑你怎樣吃苦耐勞，却經不起　潦不收。還有照例到時必交的一地租……這些重担，使他無法透一過氣來。</p>
<p>別看老太爺過的是苦日子，可是，他接三差五的還要享受一番，自然，鄕村裏沒有什麽可吃的東西，其實，他的慾望並不高，也根本不想吃什麽好吃的東西，充其量也不過是喝二兩老白干他有點兒口訥，但，這並沒有什麽關係，酒後雖然口訥的更凶，然而他的「話匣子」一打開，簡直是關不住的。</p>
<p>酒後，他只有話多的毛病，但，他的頭腦還說得上淸醒。所以，他的訓子課常是在酒後才上</p>
<p>記不淸是那天了，父兒倆把出裏的活兒幹完以後，太陽才剛偏西，老太爺發現壕溝裏有不少的魚在跳躍，於是，他悄悄地吿訴四代把放在船上的五股鐵叉趕快拿來，四代明白父親的意思，一言不回的便逕往船上取叉去了</p>
<p>老太爺拿到鐵叉以後，站在一臨近河邊的田坎上，兩支眼睛瞪得一樣圓，不錯眼珠的注視着碧絲的水面，當水面上起伏着水沫時，澎的一聲，鐵叉刺入水底，震時便提上一條兩三斤重的鯉魚來，老太爺笑嘻嘻地用一支靑藏葦當做繩索，穿透魚鰓，打個結兒，一手提着魚，一手拿着久，額頭上冒着不大多的汗水向着自已的小船走來。</p>
<p>四代在父親叉魚的時候，獨個兒躱在船上讀他借來的七俠五義去了。他着得正在發迷，所以，在老太爺要登船的時候，他居然沒有看到他，四代的迷勁兒就這末大。等到老太爺脚步踏上了船頭，自然的蕩漾了兩三下，這時，他把兒子的迷給驚動了。</p>
<p>他在船尾的一個角洛上，抬起頭來看了看父親的姿勞，不由得撲嗤一聲笑了。</p>
<p>「爹！你眞把它　着了。……」</p>
<p>「四代，今天你爹可有了酒喝了，」</p>
<p>「怎麽？爹咱們不自個兒熬熬吃？你要把它賣了。」</p>
<p>『哼！自己吃？傻小子，好幾斤重哪，爹真眞捨不得賣了它，咱們幾犬的「交過」</p>
<p>（即生活費）都够了。還不要說，爹還可以喝二兩，我…我爲什麽不…不賣了它呢！」</p>
<p>四代當然不好反抗，第一他是他的爹，第二爹說話也頗有道理，雖然自己有點兒　，想熬熬魚吃，可是，爹有爹的主意。不說這些吧，魚是爹叉上來的，當然爹有支配它的權利。何況，爹叉魚的時候自己幷沒有帮忙，偸偸的躱在船上看小說，爹沒有發脾氣，這面子已經够足了，硬要爹不賣魚自己吃，那簡直是過分的要求。何况老太爺有酒癮，不賣魚，那來得錢打酒呢？</p>
<p>四代想到這裏他忽然想起前火給爹在小鋪裏賒酒的時候，女老　那付臉子可眞够十五個人　半月的，想米想去，認爲爹的主意是對的。所以，後來他什麽話都沒有說，不等爹說話，自個兒就划起船來，向着自己的村落前進！</p>
<p>那正是暮春時節，蔚藍的天空　罩着一片綠油油的景色，整個的農村像是遮起一條絲絨毡，兩河沿岸的蘆葦，像絲竹般的直立着，偶爾來了　陣小風，便毫無自主的隨着風向飄擺着。幷做着沙沙的聲響。</p>
<p>河的低處，靠着邊緣的地帶，漂浮着翠綠的荷藥，水面上成案的鴨子也攸閒　遊來遊去，高興時，它們也喳喳地歌唱起來，天空中不時的飛翔着鴉及其他各抓的小烏兒，兩岸上的垂柳迎着晚風飄蕩，像是對着駕着不舟的父子列起了歡迎隊。</p>
<p>週圍的景物，雖說這樣美麗可愛，但是，在他們的眼光中並不感覺怎麽樣，因爲他們是司空見慣的了。</p>
<p>四代一面划船，一面引吭高歌，他所唱的一不是洋歌，二不是皮　，乃是地地道道的梆子腔秦腔。這是他在村裏的戲，會裏學來的本領，而且他已經登台表演過幾次了。他是一個很有名的農村小票友，他不但唱得不錯，武工還相當可觀，因爲人家是唱武生的呢。他，今年已活滿了十六歲，可是，還沒有娶親，其實，老太爺並不是沒有早早抱孩的念頭，只是因爲窮，一切都無從談起，說眞的，那時，老太爺才剛滿四十歲，論理，還可以接個老伴，其實，老太爺　嘗沒有這個意思呢？可是，一想到小的問題，兒子結親也罷，自已接老伴也好，便都無從談起了。錢這個東西就這樣「拿攝」人！</p>
<p>老太爺平時雖然常跟別人誇耀說，自己的兒子長得好，眞是天庭飽滿，地闊方圓，將來必有火富火貴。眞有那天到來的時侯，自已豈不眞就成了老太爺了嗎？然而，對於兒子學戲也並不反對，當然，他們學戲都在晚間，一點都妨書不了日間的工作也是主要的原因。</p>
<p>所以，四代在划船的時候唱戲消遣，他並不說什麼，而且他還　着　煙管在笑迷的傾聽着一呢。</p>
<p>船　岸的時候，太陽還沒有黏山呢，老太爺左手提魚，右手拿着一條綫索上了岸，把繩索在一棵小樹上轉了幾轉，然後打了個結兒，船便停在那裏，老太爺透自回到自已那間唯一的祖上的遺產—小破房裏去，四代取掉划漿，抗在肩膀上也緊跟着下了船。把漿放在屋裏，然後向老太爺說說「爹，咱們揍揍（即做的意思）什麽吃呀？」</p>
<p>老太爺看了看兒子，把魚提到他的面前，「四代，你先本到街上把他賣了，回頭再揍飯吧。我還不大餓……」</p>
<p>四代沒有說什麽，接過魚來就向外走，剛一跟出門檻，老太爺又說話了。</p>
<p>「四代，你把我這個酒瓶子帶去，賣了魚，記着光給我打四兩酒回來，另外再包二兩藍花荳下酒。……呃，若是有賣燒餅，果子（汕條）的，你自己要吃幾套就買幾套，反正，我喝了酒也就不想吃晚飯了，你弄幾套燒餅果子吃就算了，免得再　飯，這些個日子子以來，你也太苦了。爹多也應該買點吃食犒勞你一下了。……好，去吧。」</p>
<p>四代反轉身來接過了老太爺的酒壺，點了點頭，便到街上去了。</p>
<p>兒子走了以後，老太爺也感覺着有點兒疲倦了，坐在坑上，後背靠着土牆，獨自一袋接一袋吸着老關東　的葉子烟。四代出門以後，也頗爲順利，沒有等到吆喚，便被大地主的小兒子出了一塊錢的代價買了去。（未完）</p>

<p>上週金鈔欣欣向榮，進口商收吸美鈔甚勁，行情冉冉向上，至週末始下挫，終較前週軋升二百元，黃金亦因美鈔上升而激昂，比前週末軋升六七萬元，羣股兩大熱門較穩，其餘平疲不一，洋股交易微細，脚地虛軟，統價在還本不利情勢中，市勢下降，米市鮮有振作，惟米蠹仍暗中活躍未已，茲將一週市况探誌於次：</p>
<p>烚赤　週初步步向榮，緣因局勢不穩，美鈔盤挺，吸收者頻有，行情由一八六萬步升至一八九萬五，週二更俏至一九六萬，後因多頭吐售，週四已低至一八六萬五，週五美鈔復告上升，行情跟踵上展，收價在一九一萬，週六起伏狹隘，最後價一九〇萬，全週中行配售一四五一條，以週四配售價爲最低，週三一九六萬爲最高。</p>
<p>外幣　美鈔以國外奢侈一品抵滬頗多，結款紛紛扒吸，執貨者見機抬高，週初二五一〇元，至週三己高至二千八百元，後因中行將對美鈔買賣嚴格管制，人心盧軟，終退至二六七〇元，週四續吿下游，其後進口商雖有需要，市勢轉挺，但週末午後已直綫下瀉。</p>
<p>公債　週一堅定，週二因抽　還本，散戶心虛，斬了甚多，加以空方乘機活動，市勢下挫，丙種隔日收價五千元，是日開盤即低至五千五，最後軋小至五千二百五，甲乙戊種一度至三千二百五，丁種三千〇三十，週一三謠傳關金還本，空方活動，行一情繼續劇降，丙種由五千二退至一四千三百五，甲乙戊二千七百，丁種六千二百五，週四北幫逢低一收吸，補空甚多，價見回上，週六證券幫拋空，在賣勢中趨勢不一振，丙種退至四千六，甲乙二千一七百五，丁種二千五百五，戊種一二千九百五。一</p>
<p>華股　週一獲利吐售，市勢堅後轉疲·週二在補空中回升，永紗挺至六千〇五，美亞四千六，景福三一五，新光三一〇，勤興二四〇，餘亦均升，週三出籠頻有，市勢稍回，週四吐售仍多，價續步小，惟永紗在掉換新股聲中，獨呈俏俐，由六千元升至六千四百五，其餘稍有榮辱，週五冷門股多頭有吐，價多虛軟，熱門股永紗平，美亞反挺，景福等俱略小，週六永紗獨占鰲頭，因新股將上市，人心振奮，買意濃厚，價趨上挺，一度見六千七百元外，終在六千六百五，餘均平疲。</p>
<p>外股　週初尙呈堅穩，一多頭頻吸，惟脚地軟弱，交易不旺，會德豐週一一萬六，週二升至一萬七千五，週三以後即露疲態，週六續降至一萬五，怡紗週二由一萬一千三升至一萬二千五，後即步步回小，至週六收價一萬一千三，與週一收市價同，英聯週二由一萬元升至一萬一千，週三四退至一萬〇三，週五回升至升一萬〇一，週六退入萬元內，九千八有交易，其餘則榮　亙見。</p>
<p>食糧　在當局　格監視下，投機米囊活　爲難，但竟發生塲外黑市交易，殊引人注意，　市塲買賣，全週鮮有變化，各檔貨軒輊難分，週三曾一度稍生波動，執貨者無意照市吐脫，以致全部次貨朱有做開，但高貨尙能應市，是日社會　曾在市場揭貼布吿，剴勸正當米商照章交易，週四市長親臨米市場，敦促遵章買賣，週五卅三家米號門市所需米糧由指定各米行照市撥配每戶十石，週六趨勢稍見轉機，人心仍忐忑不安。</p>
<p>現鈔　在上週間，客帮一實際銷路時斷時續，缺乏大批交易，市價在五萬至十萬元之間徘徊，緣紡建公司鑒於時令關係，現下出數遞增，至於熱門貨之四十二支及卅二支等雙股細　，亦時有應市，兼之其他民營紗廠出數亦不少，是以市上供給籌碼似較充裕，以前之四十二支藍鳳等紗太高，廿支及十六支紗太低，今已逐漸軋籠，前途有愈形軋籠之可能，紡建公司星一開紗廿八種，星三開卅抓，星五開廿八種，共開八十六種之多云。</p>
<p>布市　因紡建公司開售布疋多，兼以外貨充斥，週内客帮曁門莊需要平凡，市努絕鮮變幻，全呈平定局面，各種布疋均興前週無甚變動，紡建公司星二開布疋卅種，美　布廿四抓，星四開布疋卅種，美墨布十一種，星六開布疋卅種，美墨布十九種。</p>
<p>花布　週內紡建公司仍存觀望，未有採辦，此外民營紗廠如大成。民豐。安達。大生。申新二廠。蘇綸。嘉豐。慶豐。寳豐。新裕等廠均有相當之採辦，市勢比紗布兩項脚地爲俏，米特林高級貨送廠價曾高至十萬九千元，結果各花較前週末約漲三四千元，海外紐约美棉期現貨均漲卅餘磅音云。</p>
<p>人造絲　一二〇號天橋週一一百四十二萬元，週二漲六萬元，週三回小四萬元，週四起漲風又盛，良以中紡公司開貨價足以左右市價，以致週五大七萬元，週六大四萬元，結果週六比週一大十四萬元，雜牌一二號有光均漲起十六七萬元，七五號金鶏半光亦高十六萬元。</p>
<p>廠絲　高勻度洋行毫無納胃，中級七十五分及七十七分有檢騐單貨，做開二百廿萬元至廿七萬五千元之間，用戶絲交易比較熱鬧，各檔在一週內俱大五萬至十萬元之譜，干經洋行貨週六做一百八十萬元，用戶干經，一週內價總在一百五十五萬至六十萬元左右。</p>
<p>綢貨　上週頗多變化，不乏投機者涉足所致，美亞被面週一一百四十七萬元，至過三即做六十萬元，週四小五萬元，週五續疲，做開甚少，週六又復高做六十萬元左右，總計大十二三萬元，大誠格子壁縐週初價五千一二百元，週二經某大戶搜購，遂一扶搖直上，迄週三比週一漲起百分之十強，週四因不乏乘高拋售，乃不支下挫，週五仍軟，週六故態復萌，仍做到週三最高價，一週内總計漲起五百元之譜。</p>
<p>五金　本週以廠　提高，美國定貨不接，故較上週更爲堅挺，興華狗牌V門鎖以出品不多，尙未問世，門鎖及抽屜鎖因客幫採辦，更兼工資提高，頗呈蓬勃狀態，白鐵管一寸以上有到貨，四分六分以存貨不多頗見俏利，餘貨皆屬平平，無甚高下。</p>

<p>（聯合社華盛頓十五日電）中美農業專家將在今後六個月內，爲中國農業確立一永久計劃，使中國農民可得更大之收獲。此事係由國民政府提議，美方代表由加州大學副校長兼農學院院長胡吉博士領導，定於七月一日抵滬。另一代表爲美國農業部部員布克，曾在金陵大學任敎多年，據布氏談稱，此項計劃，對於中美兩國均有價値，均有利益。我人將援助中國更善利用其天然資源，且使其所用人員與資金，能獲得更大之報償。美代表團計共九人，對於農業各部門均有專長，中國方而亦將指派委負團，與美代表團合作。凡興農業有關各物，自蠶絲以至桐油，及製造地氈之羊毛，均將受中美專家注意研究，此項計劃之一大目的爲增加收獲，穩定生產。試舉桐油爲例，美國需要更多品質優良之桐汕，以穩定之價格，供給一定之數量，比與美國桐油生產並不衝突。美代表團抵華後，將在京滬兩地勾留數星期，俾於各項問題，更形熟悉，然後旅行全國，以兩個月之時間，詳細考察農村情形。代表團中除胡吉生與布克外，尙有七人爲伊利諾大學校長凱斯，懷華明大學斐恩斯工程顧問赫伯，阜及尼亞理工學院薛茲，農業部員克萊，聯合國善後救濟總署中國分署漁業顧問南斯倍德，及善救分署農業敎育家赫莫爾</p>

<p>從現階段民族工業的危機　說到未來中國工業發展的必然性　章柏菴</p>
<p>一個民族工業之有高度的發展，其條件並不是單純的，牠要許許多多條件的配合，但其中最要的自然是「人事」，什麼事都要人去做，人事沒有辦法，一切便都沒有辦法。</p>
<p>我國工業危機，不自今日始，七七以後，中國一般工業，都得到戰時繁榮，牠的發展，可以說很迅速，亦可以說唯其因爲是戰時的「繁榮」，所以很迅速的發達，也很迅速的崩頹。</p>
<p>達在卅三年的春季，重慶遷川工廠聯合會，已指出了中國工業的危機，同時翁部長亦想出種種方法來補救，但是工業的發展，是按步就班的，在發展的時候，就不能用任何壓力來阻遏牠；反之及其崩潰，也自然而然每况愈下，不是用補救方法所能濟事。</p>
<p>我國民族工業，戰前尙不能說是「已具雛形」；戰時在窮山惡水裏面，根本無工業條件的配合，工業的建立，從何說起，戰後沿海工業地區，原有工業財產，如數收回了，但是由於「人事」沒有辦法，不但沒有好好地接管這份從血泊中奪回來的財產，反而將這些生產網解了體！這也難怪，因爲驟然勝利後，一切的步驟却紊亂，工業生產，當然亦在「亂」的氛圍裏面。</p>
<p>及至最近，民族工業，由危機四伏而進人了崩潰形態了，誰爲爲之，孰令致之？這問題就値得硏究了。</p>
<p>最近滬地有二十餘家工廠關了門，其餘有許多工廠正在向裁員减薪的路上走去，原因是工資原料成本高，而成品價値低，工廠不能維持，只有向死路上走，可是這還不是驚人，因爲現在的民族工業，好像是染了時疫病一樣，年紀小的以及身體壞的，當然先死，年紀大的以及身體好的。也是不免於一死。事實上現在的民族工業，誰都貼上了催命符，規模小的，固然因不能競爭而中斷，規模大的，不是荀延殘喘，定是直截了當做投機，生產不如投機，非投機就無以生存。這是在工業經營上的一種反常現象，其次呢，有許多工業，實際上是能够與外貨競爭，利潤厚的，也未嘗沒有，但是現在也覺得染了時疫而頭痛了，原因也不出於工資原料成本，日見其干　直上。工業家，只知接續戰時暴利主義一件成品的造成，「工資」增加了，反而有詞可藉，也就來一次照加，一次二次的加上去，工業家的成本計算書上怎樣呢？譬如某種製成品，依照戰時暴利計算，是一萬元的製成成本，加一萬元的利潤，也並不是「黑心」，假定這一萬元裏的工資成本爲二千，如果要增到三千時，工業本一家反正照樣算盤子上變成了六，一這是戰時暴利主義，禍延了工業一家，同時更毒死了「工人」！工業家好像是打賭，不是幹工業，今日有錢今日　，明日關門且再說。</p>
<p>還有許多工廠，也情隨時遷，什麽都官僚化，從經理以至於小職員，個個爲私囊着想。幹工業等於做了官，旣當官做，一切投機營利，是不可避免的！</p>
<p>依此而論，中國工業，能够「生存」，能够競爭的簡直是少數中的少數。然而目前這種工業危機，也以是暫時的，不能成爲中國工業一世不能出頭的論證，不過照目前中國民族工業的所作所爲，却可以說，大部要關了門，爭氣的還是能够「生存」，能够「競爭」，『物必先腐也，而後蟲生了」，優勝劣敗，幹工業的又何嘗能够逃出天演公理呢？現在工業的崩潰，即是未來復與的象徵！</p>
<p>那末，我們民族工業，會不會發展了呢？要回答這個問題，我可以說「中國爲什麽要和日本抗戰到底？」抗戰到底是全民要求生存的根本願望，「中國工業化」又何嘗不是全民求生存的根本願望呢？現在民族工業之圯頽，一言以蔽之「人的問題」了。</p>
<p>本來，從我國的工業條件來說，可說是處處勝過人？中國人的聰明睿智，又何嘗後於他人？試看戰時許多工業，都表現得非常精采，沒有的東西，也樣樣想出法子來代替，那時候的工業條件，遠不及現在，我們常然要奮鬥一下，現在一切條件，比前勝過多多，又何嘗不可以奮鬥一下呢？至於說是有外貨的勁敵，以及工業資本的缺乏，這是根本不成問題的，外國人從遙遠的地方製造出來的東西，傾銷於我國，我國難逍眞的不能「以逸待勞」嗎？而工業資本的缺乏，市場游炎怎麽會有如此之多呢？這都是够我們深思反省的—六，十六，料醫療器械理化用具等，地點在貴州路八號。</p>

<p>— 丁澤譯</p>
<p>從來美國汽車製造業中，以福特，通用，及克來斯勒著稱為三大巨頭。本年二月起，有新興之凱塞福來着（Ｋaiser　Frazer）汽車工廠（以下簡稱凱福汽車廠）加入競爭。因之美國汽車製造中以地之地德羅地方人士，正以一九二四年觀察克來斯勒崛起奮鬥之同眼光，注視此新工廠。</p>
<p>凱福汽車廠之二位主人翁在美國皆已享有盛名。亨利凱塞（Henry`J.Kaiser）為著名鋼鐵重工業製造巨擊，在大戰期內，除汽車以外，幾乎包辦一切鋼鐵金屬機器。福來善（Joseph　W.Frazer）向来斐聲於汽車界。</p>
<p>凱福汽車廠之新汽車，計有二種，各以主人翁福來善與凱塞名之。前者售價一千二百美元至一千五百美元，其特點一·新樣車身，二·闊大前窗，三·寬敞之車身與坐位，四·具有一百匹馬力之普通引擎。後者價格約一千美元，其車身與前者相仿，用前輪主動。車重則較福來善輕五百磅，馬力亦略小。福來善汽車準備與奧斯摩別爾，別克，道奇，摩克利，等中價汽車競爭。凱塞汽車準備與福特，雪佛蘭，克來斯勒，順風牌等低價汽車相競爭。</p>
<p>凱福汽車廠準備大量制造，預計在本年夏季，每種汽車每天可出七百五十輛，十二個月產量約三十萬輛。</p>
<p>凱福汽車公司現有資本二千餘萬美元，及與合併之格勒亨柏（Graham-Paige）汽車廠之機械，與制造新機器之能力。若與現存三巨頭福特，通用，克來斯勒合併之資本三十五萬萬美元之相比，則相差遠矣。</p>
<p>制造汽車所用主要工具，價值甚鉅。以壓制車身鋼殼之全副模型而論，即需費三百萬美元。壓制車身車門車頂之整套機器，需費美金六十一萬五千遠。故以凱福汽車廠現有之資金，紐約與地德羅兩地人士，並不寄以成功之希望。各方面投來之批評，大多不利。有云福來善從來未曾制造汽車，彼所擅長者僅能推銷汽車耳。有云凱塞只知如何造船，對汽車乃外行也。有云福來善或可雇傭一批工程師，為之制造汽車，但不知誰願為其售賣。亦有人云此汽車廠或僅為投機股票之事業，不免危及凱塞之令譽等等。此類批評難免不含有嫉姤之意，然此新汽車廠之成立，無疑可其從保守性急速趨向採用近代新發明。</p>
<p>凱福汽車廠已在柳溪（Wilow　Run）地方租得一大飛機廠廠屋，租期五年。該廠將自造車身，自造引擎，自造前輪主動機件，其他機件則將向市上憂購現成標準零件。</p>
<p>在草此文時，柳溪廠屋內正在重新改裝汽車機器中。福特汽車廠已將所有盡數遷出。政府所有制造飛機之設備，亦已搬往戰爭剩餘財產之堆棧中。凱福汽車廠早已定制汽車工具，正在裝設中。大量鋼鐵材料，亦在源源而來，廣告亦已編繪就緒，而待發表。鋼鐵巨頭凱塞氏正自西海岸起程東來視察。各地經銷處正籌備新汽車揭幕典禮。而實際推動此新組織之福來善，則正在巨大之辦公室中，忙於接見來賓。</p>
<p>大與凱福二氏接近之人士，則皆不否認二氏將遇一場汽車競爭惡戰。然而一致認為有四大利點：即1.新車具有之優點，2.戰后渴待購買汽車者之眾多，3.國內大眾在戰時對凱塞功績之崇仰，4.福來善過去事業之成功。</p>
<p>福來善在汽車界之奮鬥，原已為時甚久，此次已為其傾資從事之第三次。當一九二四年克來斯勒以資本四百萬美元盤盡馬克思威爾（Maxwell）汽車廠時，福來善被推為克來斯勒汽車廠之推銷部經理，後復升為總廠，副經理。一九三九年福氏脫離克來斯勒廠時，該廠已發達至美國三大汽車巨　之一，其每年營業額達五萬五千萬美元。福氏繼入惠立司奧佛蘭（Willys-Overland）汽車廠為總經理時，適為總廠最不景氣之際，每年營業額僅九百萬美元，職工總數一千一百人。迨一九四三年福氏　去惠廠時，職工總數已增至一萬四千人，營業額每年一萬七千萬美元（在一九四四年此數又增至二萬一千二百萬美元）。惠廠之發達一方固賴福氏才幹，一方亦受戰爭之賜。惠廠在戰時大造吉普車而聞名，雖吉普車並非福氏所首創，然其為吉普車擴大宣傳，風靡全國則壓功非小也。</p>
<p>福氏境況素佳，自入克來斯勒廠後，更一直享受鉅額薪金。今新廠所定年薪為八萬二千五百美元。其住宅比美於其他富翁。其嗜好亦與美國富商巨賈相同，在亞利松那省置有大牧場，奧海啞省置有大農場。此外除擔任紐約派拉若大旅館之董事，對汽車以外之事業，不發生興趣。</p>
<p>福氏之母系出於華盛頓大總統之叔。福氏受耶魯大學敎育不久，即就業為機械師副手，每小時工資僅一角六分。後入派卡汽車廠學校為敎師，不久派卡廠紐約經售處成立，福氏乃開始其銷售汽車之途程。自一九一四年起福氏即從事於投資汽車，推銷汽車，及促進汽車事業等方面。繼由派卡廠轉入通用汽車廠出口部，又入利　（Pierce　Arrow）汽車廠，然後入克來斯勒廠，遂大露頭角。經十五年工夫發展該廠後，攜同一部份幹練工程人才，入惠立司奧佛蘭廠。平時福氏所服應之警句為『保守為錯覺，休息非人生之目的。』此二句可以釋明福氏因何在克來斯勒廠全盛時脫離之，反投入萎敗之惠立司奧佛蘭廠之目的矣。福氏在惠廠時，有許多棘手問題，須待懈決，某一星期甚至無錢發給工資，不得不親自出馬，賣卻八十五輛以資應付云。</p>
<p>福氏在惠廠時已擬自造汽車，其建議未為惠廠董事長所接受，故於一九四三年辭職。福氏從事於汽車界　　卅年中，此尚為第一次脫離。然在前途，卻有二大好機會，一為戰爭可以結束，其一為戰時數年中停造民用汽車可以復業。當此機會到臨時，汽車制造業不論新廠舊廠，可以不必宣傳而得暢銷。凡能制造良好汽車者，更易出售。決無昔日市塲狹小，須奮力競爭及傾巨資於宣傳廣告之需要。凡此種處有利觀點，福氏知之甚稔，然福氏已離汽車界後，必須集合一大資金，覔取一大廠基，設計一種汽車，從事組織之。</p>
<p>一九四四年福氏為華倫重機器廠所敦請，為之解決其所遇之難關。當時華倫廠接受海軍定造登錄艇定單後，發見制造方面有困難。是時福毅然應聘，蓋福氏已胸有成竹，將藉此為制造汽車盡身之階。其後。果得實現其計劃。</p>
<p>福氏根據奧海啞省法定以最小資本額五百遠，組織華倫鍋爐廠。另向政府貸入巨資，以之置備機器。經福氏手下傑出工程師之策劃，制造方面之困難不久解決。政府借款逐漸償清。如是六閱月後，有格勒亨柏汽車廠者，因制造汽車大獲厚利，該廠大股東葛勒亨監於該廠前途並不樂觀，因戰前旣無顯著聲譽，戰後又無新鮮計劃，故思乘此良機，脫售其所握股權。福氏立即與其同志購入五十三萬股，冊時葛勒亨柏廠以十五萬股易華倫廠五百股。斯時也，福氏一躍而為葛勒亨柏汽車廠之董事長。最初以五百元組成之華倫廠資本。驟變為票面卅萬元價值矣。後以福氏戰後汽車之新計劃，轟動股票市塲，其股票價值增高六倍，故其資產自卅萬元又增至一百八十萬元。此時福氏一帆風順，穩操制造汽車之　，而成垣街所艷羨之對象矣。</p>
<p>福氏自任葛廠董事長後，立即車整旗鼓，委派大批工程師，改良普通汽汕引擎。又任用車身設計名家霍華達林氏，專門設計時式車身。達林氏棄來為好萊塢女明星及歐洲各界所稱遭。</p>
<p>一九四五年春，德國投降，籍氏為擴展其已有之廠務計，不斷努力尋求大資本家之合作，其努力之程度，可與其一九一三年福氏推銷派卡汽車與俄國皇子之情況相等。福氏足跡　華府，紐約，等地，僅得勸告，無一投資者。繼之訪問加省各大飛機廠，勸其戰後改造汽車，亦無應者。最后晤見美洲銀行之奇阿尼尼氏，方獲奇遇。經奇氏之拉攏，次日即得與鋼鐵巨子凱塞氏敍首。</p>
<p>二氏初見即極投機，在短短二日中，凱福汽車廠之計劃，即予奠定。兩氏前此從未謀面，凱氏去春至東部美國時，亦未相遇。凱氏素有志於制造汽車，其動機有三，一因汽車工業為一大事業。二為吸引汽車工業至美西海岸（因氏之鋼鐵事業全在該處）。三為戰後有利推銷其戰爭中膨脹之鋼錳產物。凱氏於一九四二年曾於報端與福氏作筆戰，對於汽車事業有所爭論，福氏曾誚其以造船家而談論汽車，不免遺笑內行。</p>
<p>凱氏在近四年中，實際制造汽車，曾造過十一種。彼現在使用一輛石膏汽車。此獨特汽車，即為上述十一種之一。凱氏自信在美國西部可制造一切機件，惟車身頗成問題，乃親往地德羅游說，各車身廠對之非常冷淡，凱氏氣沮，鍛羽而返。原擬改變計劃，制造小汽車，不久乃與福氏相遇。</p>
<p>今日凱塞與福來善合夥後，相得益彰。因凱氏之姻緣得租用柳溪之廠房。新公司登記手續，原須十天，經凱氏親與政府當局折衝，彼稱彼曾以五日之短促時間，可為政府造一艦船，故政府亦應加速為彼登記。五日之後，登記完成。故集股之時投資者擁躍而來，不久認股數超過規定六倍半。今者美國各地郵件雪片飛至柳溪，接洽分銷汽車者，不下九千人，其中有寗願放棄舊有合同專銷新牌汽車者。其熱中於凱氏一函中，有云，凱氏所造運輸艦，曾載歸其遠征之愛子，故決稍待以購凱氏所造汽車。又有人稱譽凱氏之造船旣大成功，造汽車亦必成功云。</p>
<h3 id="c124">工商管理概論 <a href="#c124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>— 徐百益</p>
<p>譬如我們的制造裏，需要相當多的勞工，而把我們的廠設在住宅區的鄰近，那末將來勞工都要遠道而來，發生許多不便。在上海楊樹浦一帶，是向來稱為工廠區的，許多勞工都住在那裏，一個制造廠而開設在工廠區，對於勞工的招致，就不會發生什麼困難。</p>
<p>但一方面當然還要看制造廠的性質如何，如果是一個藥廠，那末儘不妨選擇一個清幽的地方，有良好的空氣與環境，對於制造廠反面比較合宜。</p>
<p>當一個制造廠成立以後，勞工們有了長期的工作，他們也會在廠的鄰近去找屋子住下，使每天往返較為便利，但無論如何，這是一個值得考慮的問題，而可以成為決定制造廠地點的一種相當重要的成分。</p>
<p>（三）各種物件的裝配：有幾種制造廠，是需要把各種物件裝配起來的，汽車的制造廠就是一例，一家汽車制造廠，並不是自已制造車胎的，即使是車身，有時也不是自已造的，在這種情形之下，那末在選擇廠房的地點的時候，衹能求廠房的偉大，可以使工作順利進行，如果能夠處於適當中心地點，和各種必需要的物件的來源都很相近，那是最合乎理想了。</p>
<p>（四）運輸問題：一個制造廠的運輸問題。是很重要的，尤其在一個制造廠的出品暢銷全國的時候。一定要靠着便利的運輸，使貨品能夠迅速地達到各省各市，那末能夠臨近運輸的機構如火車站，碼頭之類，一則可以節省運輸的費用，二則可以節省運輸所需的時間。</p>
<p>所以當我們要建立一個新的制造廠的時候，上列幾點，是應該加以考慮的，不過事實上，有時候未必能夠把各方面的問題都圓滿地解決，那末衹有權其輕重，而加以處置了。</p>

<p>請出「國丈」示以報章</p>
<p>坐定之後，駐守員　陳科長報告，在逃副會長陶　祥，已於七日晨四時許投案，現在內室休息。經我們派人三請之後，這位　稱「國丈」的副首領，才姍姍走出。陳科長首先在口袋裏掏出益世報一份，讓這位副會長坐定細讀，意思是叫這位與世隔絕的怪人，明瞭社會部與津市當局查封該會的原因，以及主管當局今後寬大的處理方針。</p>
<p>這位副會長免強鎮靜讀畢，兩手抱頭，顯出一副苦臉，促眉閉眼，打算強擠出幾滴博人同情的眼淚，情感自然流露的眼淚不受造作的指揮，竟沒流出來。</p>
<p>出語頹喪電話離奇</p>
<p>他頽然的說：「我已是六十二歲的人，去年在哈爾濱被日本憲兵隊捕去，把牙也打掉了，耳朶也打　了，不想現在又……」據他說：六日早晨到北平等飛機，預備去上海，正在北平前外糧食店與盛館休息，接到天津電話，說大津會裏出了事，所以當晚趕回來。至於電話是誰打的，他說不是會裏人，大概是附近的朋友。這位朋友是誰，他又不肯吐實。究竟他會否去平或在津躲避，只有他自己明白。</p>
<p>「皇帝」遠走死生未卜</p>
<p>記者問「馬迎師」（即「馬皇帝」）在那裏？他說：「他老人家在二十四年就走了，跟隨他同去的兩位弟兄回來說，他老人家到南海羅奇山遊歷去了」。「以後沒有消息嗎？」記者問。他接着說：「沒有，是否尙在人間或已昇火很難說了」。記者問：「回來的兩位弟兄呢？」他說「兩位弟兄回來不久，也都死去」。</p>
<p>八大「朝臣」縱聲一哭</p>
<p>如果想在他們口裏問出「馬皇帝」的蹤跡却不是訪問所能得到的。這時聚集在大廳上的八位負責人（所謂八大朝臣）聽到「他老人家已經昇天了」的時候，竟如喪考妣似的放聲哭鬧起來，防守員警再三制止，他們以爲「一哭」而博得了大家同情，乘機誇耀他們興辦慈善事業，掩護地下工作人員的功績。</p>
<p>答記者問衆口紛紜</p>
<p>當記者問他們「在敵偽時代曾作過什麼工作，賬本怎麼也沒有呢？」他們支吾着說「過去的事了，記不淸了。」「賬本原是有的，不過因爲早聞當局就要查禁，違禁與不違禁的東西也都藏起來」一外邊人都說馬聖師是馬皇帝，有軍隊，封朝臣，納嬪妃，改曆書……」「那有這回事，不知得罪了什麽人，硬給造謠，所謂改曆書，一年改爲十八個月，每月四十八天這也不是我們自己造的，有的書是這麽說，如果行那種曆法時天下就可太平了，所以我們很信仰，也不是我們自造的呀？」</p>
<p>創會悠久歷卅五年</p>
<p>記者問他們爲什麽蓄有長　，他們說：一有髮即有法。」記者不明白他們所謂的「法」是什麽、是法術？法規？他們也不肯說淸楚。</p>
<p>他們接着說：「本會創始於辛亥年到現在整三十五年了，和中東時被人查封過後來搬到北京法在濟南被人刺死，馬聖師悲憤之餘，就不知去向了。他們口口　聲表明他們純粹慈善的立塲，在不留心時會不自覺的會流露出一些與野心軍閥勾結倡亂的馬脚。</p>
<p>兩們「公主」內室潛修</p>
<p>他們爲了表白他們的內院並沒有什麽秘密，希望引導記者到各部看看，記者跟隨他們樓上樓下走馬看花的看看，當然不會經易發現什麽秘密。百六十二名男會員設佈在各室，很安閑的坐待命運安排。百四十五名女會員，已有四十五名於）日前報鎖戶口返籍，剩下的只有老弱鄉婦鄉女，或有幾位三十上下的婦女，也不似外間所傳美若天仙。不過在戶口册上看來，除了十分之一是老太婆與小丫頭以外，多是二，三十歲的妙齡少婦，這是竟沒有見到。不過外間尊稱的兩位馬公主却未離去。一位名叫馬好成，年二十九歲，一位名叫馬善星，年三十歲，據說都是道衣道帽，因爲感到不舒服，在内室臥息，記者沒肯打攪，未能瞻仰公主的風采。女會員室内的器具陳設，坐臥傢具都是古色古香，華麗奪日置身其內，很難感到是靜修的所在。雖富賈闊老的宅第不及也。</p>
<p>園多異卉佛堂深閉</p>
<p>出了內院，進入花園亭臺樓閣，奇花珍木，幽閒僻靜，雖然年久失修，也不能掩閉其豪華本色。客應與内宅的中間是佛堂，因爲已被津警局查封，不能窺其全豹，隔從窗戶玻璃内看，只見香案羅陳供品，當中供着一個硃砂佛字，據說該會並不崇拜偶像。只以無極老母爲無形的主宰而已</p>
<p>在總會參觀完畢之後，又到該會附設「救濟貧民診療所」，該所是三進的四合院，前院是醫院，有位西醫已返大同原籍。中醫王某也以同樣裝束出現在我們的面前。中院是女會員宿舍，大部集中總會，只剩下一瞽一聲的老婦留守。</p>
<p>後院是廚房，廚房底下有間地窖，已塞滿了爐灰，下面有沒有秘密，現在尙未發現。仍有一處是學校業已停頓。一處是女會員宿舍，不過都已集中總會，沒有再去參觀的必要，也就作罷了。</p>
<p>拉雜寫來，都是記者的一幣所得印象，因爲該會各處事先都加掩飾，很難得到外間所傳的對證。當事人的書語支離，更不容易從談話間有所發現，事情的本身是個謎，謎的揭穿不是短時間所能辦到，眞像如何，有待當局的多方搜索與當事人的坦白吐實。</p>

<p>自從甲午以來，作着侵華迷夢的日本軍國主義者，爲了達到它那大陸政策的幻想，除了在正面實施各種侵略攻勢以外，並在暗地裏扶植那些毫無國家觀念的軍閥土棍們，製造許多足以促成我國内亂的根苗。七七事變後，它們更變本加厲的在佔領區域内，製造各種傀儡組織，利用各種秘密結社，煽動邪說，以消滅我們同胞的愛國心情，腐化我國的社會秩序。</p>
<p>惴惴不安登報闢謠</p>
<p>在六日以前，一心天道龍華聖敎總會曾在各報上遍登廣吿闢謠，並表明該會立塲的正大，我們就覺得有些可疑，爲什麼大家對一個宗狄團體，要造出那些謠言呢？結果，事實揭穿了，所謂一心天道龍華聖敎總會，原來就是前面所說的敵人一手製成的一個邪說鬼道的秘密組織。</p>
<p>手眼通天要犯漏綱</p>
<p>六日十時許，警察局奉了市政府的命令，特派刑事大隊隊長，行政科長和該管第七分局長賈翰臣等率領着武裝警察三十餘人，前往楊家花園四十七號一心天道龍華聖敎總會，執行查禁工作，於十一時到達該會，當即展開搜查。會首馬冠英和副會首陶雲翔，並四十五名年輕貌美的女會員，早已聞風先逃。其餘一百三十名男會員正在那裏作着它們每日例行的修練工作。經過辦案人員的說明來意以後，這些甘被愚弄的鄕民們，便立時失掉了知覺似的被龍華聖母給斷送在法網裏。</p>
<p>查抄結果正清理中</p>
<p>社會局聞訊也派員趕到，並協助警察局的查禁人員檢查護會内部的一切，於是該會勾結日敵成立「大東亞佛敎總會」和縣掛日旗，改訂曆書的種種證據，都被檢査人員發覺了。當時，社會局的人員便表示，這些會員都是安善的良民，因爲受了邪說鬼道的煽惑，以致傾家蕩產的來投身該會。這在人情上講，是非常可憐的。關於該會違法的部分，除由警察局方面繼續根究會首馬冠英的下落外，社會局方面決定對於該會的一百三十名會員，予以適當的處理，以免除他們未來的痛苦。</p>
<p>關於當局這次查禁一心天道龍華聖敎總會的動機，據說遠在六個月以前張市長甫行蒞任的時候，那時便有許多人向市府吿密舉發，並揭穿了該會抓種的罪狀。當時張市長以該會旣是宗敎團體，又擁有十來萬的會員，不便率然用事，除了一面派員調查該會的眞相，一面更分函各省市函詢該會在當地的活動狀况，同時更親身和杜副市長，胡社會局長，李警察局長等先後跑到該會去査看。結果，發現了很多可疑的地方。日前，山西山東等省市黨政機關又分別函復天津市政府，證明該會純係邪敎。社會部也在日前　函津市，說明該會行蹤詭密，頗多可疑，希望津市府就近查禁。因此，市政府　在昨天清晨頒下了查禁命令，派警察局即刻停止該會的活動。</p>
<p>自稱皇帝封臣納妃</p>
<p>按一心天道龍華聖敎會起源於山東長山丁王莊，創始人馬士偉，字冠英，乃一土棍、向不安分，後竟異想天開，妄思稱帝，創設一心堂，以旁門左道誘惑鄉民，致墮其衛者極夥。入會時須先將全部家私捐獻會中，故又名傾家會或凈地會，一如白蓮敎之作風。山東省政府曾下令取締，該馬某遂避走大連，勾結日敵重興奮業。並於民國廿三年憑藉日人之掩護，潛來天津，在　日租界桃山街覓址設會，至此始正式定名爲一心天道龍華聖敎會，取得日本總領事館之許可證，在日租界内公開活動，散佈邪說，廣收生徒，自稱馬皇帝，封大臣，納嬪妃，並擅改曆書，訂一月四十八天</p>
<p>一年十八個月。會員咸留髮　鬚，高帽左衽，彼時該會會徒　時常結隊，招搖過市，極盡妖異之能事。七七事變後，天津淪陷，該會遂乘勢遷移楊家花園四十七號，大肆活躍。為報答日人支援盛情，特成立「大東亞佛敎聯合總會」，爲日寇軍國主義說法，在我國宗敎史上，塗上了一塊腥穢。</p>
<p>廣收會徒組織嚴密</p>
<p>該會會址面積寬闊，佈置華美，其富麗堂皇之情形，一若宮室，會中人員，全係會徒，外人概不得混入其內，即差役·車夫·瓦匠·木匠·成衣·廚夫，皆由會中人自辦，儼然一小王國。</p>
<h3 id="c127">漢城談判問題 <a href="#c127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>若干外交方面人士最近指責莫斯科外長會議後國務卿貝爾納斯解釋的錯誤，以致發生了一連串事件，終使美蘇對韓問題的談判趨於破裂。使會議破裂的因素，還有許多，蘇聯堅持某某韓人黨派不准加入韓臨時政府，便是其中一端。</p>
<p>觀察家們强調說：我人不能將全部譴責，諉諸美國或蘇聯。在美國表示意見的自由原則和蘇聯政治的現實主義之間，存在着許多誤會的主要因素，同樣地也有不少衝突的地方。許多誤會還是由貝爾納斯的聲明而起，貝氏的聲明首先暗示說韓國的託管制可能予以避免。駐韓美軍司令霍奇中將那時就用這篇聲明去對付韓人反對三强託管決議的表示。此舉的結果，促成了蘇聯的懷疑，蘇聯疑心美國有修改莫斯科會議決議案的企圖。最近，蘇聯宣稱韓國問題談判已吿失敗，顯示此一事件是蘇方的主要憂慮，但是事後發生的種種事件，正可解釋目前的困難所在。一九四三年十二月，故羅斯福總統，英前首相邱吉爾和　蔣主席在開羅會談時，曾經答應在　機到來時，恢復韓國的獨立。　在美國那時正考慮着託管的期限，原來的一連串錯誤，就從「時機到來時」這一句的誤解上開始，所謂「時機到來時」，韓人却把它譯成「立即」。在一九四五年二月的雅爾達會談内，羅斯福總統首先把韓國問題公開向史達林元帥宣佈，史達林同意美國所擬的託管制計劃。第三個事件，發生在一九四五年七月彼茨坦會議的時候，當時杜魯門總統得到了史達林方面同意美國所提託管計劃的第二項表示。在那時整個期間中，蘇聯對於此一問題，竟表示極少興趣，使美方獲有蘇聯實在不要韓國託管制的種種印象。當貝爾納斯到莫斯科去的時候，他和他的專家們預料：如果要使蘇聯同意簽字在這個計劃書上，必將發生苦爭，可是蘇聯卻立即對此表示同意，不過主張將託管期改爲「五年期」，以代美國計劃内的十年期。</p>
<p>莫斯科會識後三天，貝爾納斯廣播演講，暗示託管制有避免的可能。蘇聯認爲貝氏的聲明和霍奇將軍的援用這篇聲明，是美國企圖毀棄莫斯科會議内託管決議案的表示。美國想使蘇聯同意於託管計劃，曾經化費了兩年功夫，美國這種態度，蘇聯是不易諒解的。現在，這計劃已經雙方簽字，可是美國却好像在談論着不付實行的可能性。另一方面，蘇聯立即針對着反託管運動，提出要求，主張韓國國内反對莫斯科會議決議案的黨派不應加入韓國臨時政府。美國反對蘇聯這種要求，說這種要求破壞表示意見和「肅淸官紀」的自由。美蘇委員會在漢城會談了好幾個星期毫無結果，而破裂的　結，就在道一點上。美國務副卿艾克遜强調說：美國深願重開談判並履行莫斯科會議決案議，但須蘇聯承認全韓人民表示意見的自由以後始可。（本報編譯室譯）</p>

<p>編輯先生：我是貴報的一個讀者，僅僅幾天。在敝鄉當然很少看報的機會，我現在看到貴報，眞是幸甚。貴報言論公正，很能替人民說話，我才提筆將敝鄕几年來所處的地獄寃海一樣的事實寫出，替寃死的老百姓呌屈，而向那班慢殺青年男女的日人和拿着手槍勒逼良民的匪徒們控訴。敝鄕位居於揚州北鄕三十里的地方，一個小小的黃珏橋鎭。因爲人口密，村落多，他鄉無可比擬。地土雖然肥沃，而陳不接新，是每年發生的現象。軍興以來，　鄉爲了自衛起見，組織了稍近迷信的大刀會，然而却受日人妒忌了，以爲是有計劃的組織。在一個天剛亮的早晨，敝鎭光降了百十個殘暴的日人，他搶去了我們大刀會所有的大刀，一里方圓的地方，殺死竟超過二百之多，單趙家林一村，被慘殺四十多靑年男女。當時吾鄕慘景，東屍一堆，西屍一堆，一到晚那哭乘乖兒子的聲音響遍村野。寫至此，我眞心酸欲泣。從此大刀會就無聲無息的了。接着敝鎭又光降了王長基，趙斜頭郭水泉老苗等領導的三四十便衣隊，名爲維護本鎭，實在是土匪行爲，剝削備至，三天一次軍糧，五天一次軍衣費，窮苦的敝鄕怎能担當得起？他們到吾鄉未及一月，竟公然慘殺人民達六七起之多，被害者，都是二三十畝田較多的種戶。究其原因，不外抗繳軍糧，就加上一個漢奸的罪名。可憐無知的鄉民，不知漢奸罪名何處來，不明不白的　槍斃！某村一農有一漂亮的老婆，給老苗隊長看中這農人也就是漢奸罪名遭槍斃了。那郭永泉在便衣隊中，是　長的資格，他想在敝鄕立不朽之業，常拿手槍勒逼農民寫杜絕田契。一個姓陳的農戶，爲了欠几塊大洋的債，在一個冬天裏硬逼着搬出自己的住基。諸如此類的事，不勝枚舉。他們住我鄕一年不到，郭匪已積良（？…）田三四十畝之多，其餘如趙斜頭王長基等的作惡，可想而知。而可憐無吿的我等農民，先有日人的殘殺，後有匪等的橫行，只好祈求着冥冥的蒼天，早望日人屈膝，雪恥鋤奸。勝利的消息，終於傳到我們的耳裏，那時的歡欣，眞是無可形容，滿以爲日人屈膝，老中央即可到臨。然而失望得很，勝利後几天的來者却是共軍！而狡滑的郭永泉等，還光着地下工作的英雄！我氣我恨，我氣我們農民爲什麼不大喊，我恨我們農民爲什麽不大呼，而讓殘殺我們的日人還安然的住着集中營，橫行覇道的匪徒匪首，逍遙法外，還做着不知怎樣得來的官兒哩！一個道地的鄉下佬上。六·八。</p>

<p>像往日一般的死寂、南京路，放在鬼域裏的一條古追。藍的Neon　Light，螢火似的；紅的Neon　Linht，恐怖的顏色。歡笑呀、雜沓咧、那些白晝的煩囂，輕烟般裊裊到遠遠的天邊去了。空虛的氛圍，詩人會給它一個輕微的嘆息，一個沉默的低迴。</p>
<p>出現有一輛三輪車，一輛人力車，在江西路河南路轉角處、他們都用着烱烱有光的眼在搜索夜行人，從舞女家裏出來的，從沙蟹朋友公館裏出來的，從許多不知名不必知名的場所出來的……那些疲乏的歸客。他們並未利市，失望地逡巡着，夜遊者還未普遍。</p>
<p>老邁的印度看門人，如往例斜倚着四川路愚羅公司門前水泥牆。我想，他胸中有本賬，一筆一筆業已統計了某晚某晚經過若干車輛和若干行人，今夜，市街上有點異狀了。他不再記憶那恒河畔的沙粒和希馬拉耶山巓的積雪了罷？</p>

<p>— 楊謀</p>
<p>儘管社會上的秩序還要紊亂，儘　人類的道德還要淪亡，但是每個人總願多少爲自己保存些尊嚴和顏面，誰也不肯承認自己做了卑鄙的事情。</p>
<p>譬如說，儘是現在大家說吏治失修，很多貪汚凟職受賄的事發生。但是又有那個公務員，肯自承受賄？你不能說現在政界中沒有賄賂的現象，但是你又怎能說現在政界中一定有這種現象？大家的自我宣傳，誰都是一片坦白光明和偉大啊！</p>
<p>不過，最近，某機關的門口，却貼着「受賄行賄，一律嚴懲」八個大字，令人觸目驚心。論其本意，當然是警戒來者，兼示公正坦白的意思，但事實上，這也眞是畫蛇添足罷了。</p>
<p>一個盛大的結婚典禮上，一切恭維的話都可以說，但是決不會有來賓恭維新夫婦要「貞潔」。假使有人眞的這樣做，那也許會給新夫婦一個很大的難堪。而事實上，夫婦之應該貞潔，當然是天經地義。</p>
<p>塗寫滿不准小便或是畫滿花紋墻壁的地方，往往是公開的小便處。因為中國人大都是最聰明的，他們會讀反面文章，他們以爲旣然有人在寫「不准小便」，當然是有人曾在這裏小便的緣故，旣然有人曾在這裏小便，那我又爲什麼不可以呢？於是乎，洋洋乎大觀，不准小便的字樣變做公共厠所的註册商標了。</p>
<p>我們當然不愿意以「小人之心，度君子之腹」，不過，以一個堂堂市政機關，貼上這樣一個字條，未免有點悲慘！「此地無銀三百兩，對門張三不曾偸」的故事大家都滾瓜　熱的了，我們當然不希望某機關的佈吿也變成這一流的反面文章。</p>
<p>其實，要取締受賄行賄，原也很方便，用不到這樣的苦心孤詣。只要每一個職員不受賄，那就行賄的人無所施其技，只好絕跡。至於要職員不受賄，那只要憑主管的　　和整飭，要這樣的「家醜外揚」，事實上，也很少用處吧！</p>
<h3 id="c132">連環漫畫　三毛從軍記（三十六） <a href="#c132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>

<h3 id="c133">不是神話　魚介開口　海底的怪聲 <a href="#c133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>我們對於海的傳統觀念之一是：靜寂如墳墓。但是海並不是靜寂的。在許多地方的海洋裏面—像契撒比克灣（在美國佛及尼亞洲附近），墨西哥灣，舊金山洋面，及南太平洋等處—住着的魚類經常發出各種聲音，像豬，牛，貓，鼠，鴉，蛙的叫聲，有的像呻吟聲，有的像大笑聲；此外各種蝦類和甲殼類發出爆烈和唧唧啾啾的聲音。</p>
<p>而且這些聲音非常嘈雜，足以妨碍潛艇水雷等的偵察工作。在戰事初期，美國的太平洋艦隊和大西洋艦隊的司令部裏同時流傳着海底怪聲的謠言。從太平洋巡邏回來的潛水艇駕駛員報吿說：在菲律濱附近的海洋裏聽到像貓頭鷹叫，豬叫，和吱吱喳喳的聲音。從婆羅洲海岸回來的潛水艇員報吿說：聽到陰悽的呻吟聲和鐵鏈鋃鐺之聲。水底偵察器的管理員整天屛息地坐着，等候敵艇推進器的微弱的聲音，突然他的聽筒裏會發出組厲可怕的「咕嚕咕嚕」的聲音，和像爆裂般的聲音。管理員把聲音偵察器檢査之下，並不發見什麽毛病，對於怪聲的來源無法解釋。</p>
<p>美國海陸軍人員和科學家曾經在大西洋沿岸的契撒此克　裝置一種複雜的海港防禦設備，用電綫將海底顯微音器利電警器接連至海岸聽偵站，利用聲音使警燈發光。如遇德國潛水艇侵人海灣，便有一盞燈發光，如果該潛艇繼續向灣内進發，那麼其他的燈都先後發光，由此可以知道來襲敵艇的所在，於是觸發水雷把敵人轟燬。但是這個計劃未能如預期一樣奏效。當初次試用時，管理員突然喘息地呌了起來：「德國的海軍已經全部侵入海灣了！」每一隻　燈全都發亮着。</p>
<p>主管海港防禦設備的科學家們忙向洋面張望，並沒有艦隊駛入；再把機件拆開騐看，又重新裝合再試；全部警燈照舊發光。於是他們把燈熄了，用聽筒靜聽，只聽到一種粗厲的呻吟聲和哇哇聲，好像從海灣的各處發出似的。他們無法解決這個啞謎兒，只好打電話到哥倫比亞大學的戰時硏究實騐所去。該所特派音響學專家普羅福特負責研究這件事情。普氏化了許多功夫，從各方面推考硏究，最後纔從漁夫們的口中斷定那聲音是從一種叫做Croaker的銀色魚發出的，那魚長十英寸，外觀和普通的魚差不多</p>
<p>後來普羅福特弄到一對活的Croaker魚，養在一大桶的海水裏，同時把一隻水底顯微音器投入水中，然後退到相當的距離以外，和其他許多科學家靜靜地傾聽着。等到那兩條魚驚魂甫定，發覺自己還活着時，於是談話便開始了，這「閣閣」之聲由顯微音器傳到了科學家們的耳朶裏，他們一致點頭稱是。所謂「整隊的德國海軍」原來是成千　萬的Croaker魚！</p>
<p>這種魚盛產於契撒比克灣，每年平均捕獲四千萬磅，是一種重要的食用魚，另外一種叫做「鼓魚」的，也屬於此類。據說這種魚無論雌雄，體内都生有一只氣泡，形容像普通的低音鼓，由於腹内某種肌肉的抽動，便發出像擊鼓那樣的「閣閣」之聲。大隊的這種魚集合在一起時，這聲音就變成了宏大的喧　聲。</p>
<p>普羅福特和其他科學家受美國海軍的委託，繼續硏究海洋中發聲的魚類，測量它們的音量，並決定使這些聲音不致妨礙潛水艇偵察工作的方法。他們曾在某處洋海中聽到像牛叫·豬叫，雞啼·蛙鳴的各種聲音，簡直比農塲還要嘈雜！</p>
<p>據硏究的結果，發聲的魚類除上遠的　Croaker　一種外，主要的有下面幾種：海鯰·　魚·豕魚·沙　·各種鼓魚·王魚·鐵嘴魚·海　·藍翅魚·蟾蜍魚等等。這最後一種魚連續不斷地發出像小輪船汽笛的低音的鳴鳴聲，據說是海洋中聲音最鬧的一種魚。</p>
<p>這些魚有的由磨擦牙齒而發聲，有的由氣道壓氣成聲，有的由腹部肌肉打擊氣泡而發聲。</p>
<p>此外，科學家曾在太平洋中聽到幾種占怪的聲昔，至今還沒有知道是那種魚發出的：一種是咪咪的貓叫聲；一抓是令人聽了毛骨悚然的鐵鏈的琅璫之聲，竟有一位潛水艇艇長疑心它是日本的一種新式秘密武器；一種是像鐵銹鉸鏈的尖說的磨擦聲；一種是像囚犯受刑時發出的慘痛的呻吟聲，使人會疑心到有水手因犯罪而被判在海底受刑。另外有人聽到一種連續爆烈的聲音，像燃燒乾燥的樹枝和熱鍋中熬豬油的聲音。</p>
<p>在五年以前，美國海岸地質測量所所長史璜生在海洋中聽到一種神秘的「的嗒」聲，從每晨十一時起連績不斷地響着，一年到頭從來沒有間斷過。經報紙宣佈以後，一時傳說紛紜，有的說是海岸附近油井抽油的聲音，有的說是海岸道路上汽車往來的聲音，有的說是輪船的引擎聲，海沙移動而發生的電流聲，挖泥機聲，潛伏的火山的激動聲……最有趣的是有一女子寫信到報館去，說明那聲音是由於一隊中國人正在太平洋底開掘從中國通到洛杉磯的隧道。這綫索據她說是從她的丈夫那裏得來的，他曾經周遊世界各國，在夢囈中吐露了這一個秘密！</p>
<p>最後還是海岸地質測量所裏的三位科學家發見了那怪聲的來源，是兩種小蝦。這小動物約一吋半長，非常活發好鬥，極難捕捉，有大　一隻，上生一對短而有力的鉗齒，當鉗齒拍合時卽發出微弱而淸脆的的嗒聲。它們羣居在珊瑚礁附近，數以幾百萬計，它們爭取食物，拍動它們的鉗，於是發出極大的嘈聲，在一英里以外的海底也可以聽到。</p>
<p>此外，某種　在受驚時會發出像蟋蟀的叫聲，又有一種生長在深海的蟹發出像鉛筆在石板上劃寫的尖銳聲音。</p>
<p>這些海洋裏的魚介爲什麼發出這種種聲音來？科學家還沒有得到明確的證明。大槪說起來，百分之五的原因是爲了傳達意思，百分之九十五是僅僅爲了發出聲音，跟我們人類沒有兩樣。</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 16th Dispatch] Military Mediation Department Government Committee Member Zheng Jiemin and General Bai Rude arrived in Beiping at 6:00 PM on the 16th after returning from Nanjing. After a brief stay in Beiping and discussions with the Executive Headquarters regarding increasing the Northeast Group, Bai Rude will fly to Shenyang and then to Changchun. The return of Government Committee Member Zheng Jiemin to Beiping indicates that the work of the Executive Headquarters is likely to become more active again.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 16th Dispatch] General Bai Rude, the American representative of the Changchun Forward Branch of the Beiping Military Mediation Executive Headquarters, flew to Beiping on the afternoon of the 16th, accompanied by Li Minran and Wang Shoudao, representatives of the CCP group. It is reported that Li Minran will immediately proceed to Shenyang to meet with Rao Shushi, the CCP representative of the Forward Branch, and then travel with Rao to Changchun to work. Li arrived in Nanjing on the 9th of this month from Yan'an on the same plane as Zhou Enlai and is a powerful figure among the CCP group representatives. His trip from Yan'an to Nanjing and then to Changchun is of utmost importance. Furthermore, according to General Bai Rude speaking to reporters before his departure, the appendix to the Northeast Armistice Mediation Agreement signed yesterday clearly states that the effective period of the armistice agreement will end at 12:00 noon on the 22nd of this month. With the deadline approaching, he will immediately convene a meeting of representatives from both sides after arriving in Changchun, and, following the established guidelines, groups (eight groups) will set out to begin mediation work, hoping that this short-term truce will successfully lead to a permanent cessation of hostilities.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 16th Dispatch] Although today is a Sunday holiday, Special Envoy Marshall still met and talked with Zhou Enlai in the evening.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Restoration of Transportation Issue, Opinions of Both Sides Gradually Converging <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 16th Dispatch] After the signing of the Northeast Armistice Agreement, the restoration of transportation has become the focus of discussions today. It is understood that the opinions of both sides are gradually converging. Although the government has made significant concessions on the issue of demolishing blockhouses, the blockhouses that protect bridges and water towers, which are essential security facilities for road protection, should not be included in the demolition. As for railway management, this is a specialized technical issue, which is generally recognized by informed people here. In the future, for the sake of efficiency when repairing various sections, it would be most appropriate for the original railway employees to take over the management. In fact, the CCP also lacks many technical personnel to participate in management work. As for the railway transportation management personnel currently employed by the CCP in the communist-occupied areas, those whose knowledge is sufficient to perform their duties may be recommended by the CCP for continued employment by the transportation authorities. According to tonight's news, on the issue of restoring transportation, Marshall and our government share the same view that administrative integrity is essential and that personnel must be appropriately chosen. For the sake of complete transportation, the railway cannot be divided, and the appointment of personnel cannot be taken lightly. For example, the director of the railway administration appointed by the communist army east of Huomiao in the eastern section of the Longhai Railway was a porter, and this kind of personnel policy is not appropriate.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 16th Dispatch] The head of the Transportation Management Section of the Beiping Military Mediation Department was said to have invited the responsible persons from both the government and the CCP to a banquet this noon to discuss the restoration of transportation, and continued discussions in the afternoon. According to those close to Marshall, the government has made the greatest concessions on the two issues of demolishing blockhouses and unified management. If the CCP does not make political demands regarding participation in management, an agreement is expected to be reached soon, and the repair work can begin to save the tens of millions of refugees north and south of the Yellow River.</p>

<p>Spokesperson's Remarks from the Central Propaganda Department</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 16th Dispatch] The spokesperson for the Central Propaganda Department, in response to reporters' inquiries about the peace talks, stated: "The government is making every effort to seek peace and has recently proposed various concrete plans, even down to the details. The CCP, however, often makes vague and ambiguous statements. Thanks to the hard work of Marshal Marshall and his staff, many plans have already gone beyond the drafting stage. The government's concessions and frankness have been demonstrated by facts, and we sincerely hope that the CCP will also show the same sincerity. Regarding the military situation, the CCP's recent propaganda is deeply saddening and infuriating. The communist army is launching a full-scale offensive along the Jinpu and Jiaoji railways in Shandong, occupying important cities, while the CCP's propaganda claims that it is acting in self-defense or retaliation. Asking why self-defense or retaliation necessitates occupying all the important towns along the two railways, or even invading the suburbs of Jinan and Qingdao. The important cities along these railways are known to all, both Chinese and foreign, to have been captured by the communist army after June 7th, and this has been witnessed by all. How can they brazenly distort the truth to this extent? Detailed information has been released by the Ministry of National Defense and will not be repeated here. Chairman Chiang has spared no effort in the peace talks, convening senior staff members daily to study concrete plans in detail, striving to make them humane, reasonable, practical, and effective. He has reached the extreme of tolerance regarding the CCP's delays, empty rhetoric, and even its military attacks that violate agreements, and he remains firm in his perseverance for the sake of the common good and the benefit of peace. However, the communist army is attacking and occupying cities and disturbing the peace everywhere, and the National Army cannot but engage in legitimate defense to protect the land and the people. This is the duty of the government and cannot be neglected. We sincerely hope that the CCP will earnestly reflect and not shirk the responsibility for undermining peace."</p>

<p>It is reported that the issue of military reorganization and Marshall's final arbitration rights will enter the discussion phase on the 17th and 18th.

<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 16th Dispatch] This reporter recently learned from transportation circles that for the railway, highway, and waterway transportation institutions of the nine northeastern provinces, the Ministry of Communications has decided to establish a Northeast Transportation Bureau in Changchun to manage all transportation affairs. The position of director of the bureau will be concurrently held by Chen Yanjiong, the special commissioner of the Ministry of Communications in the Northeast. Mr. Chen previously served as the director of the Southwest Highway Bureau and achieved considerable success during the war. He is currently arriving in Changchun from Jinan to prepare everything. It is also learned that the entire line of the Beining Railway in the Northeast has been opened, and the railway from Jinzhou to Gubeikou only extends to Gongyingzi.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 16th Dispatch] The train between Changchun and Shenyang officially resumed today. The Dongliao River Railway Bridge north of Sipingjie, which was most severely damaged, has been repaired and completed. Test runs have been conducted for several days, and the results are good. Passenger tickets began to be sold today.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 16th Dispatch] The traffic situation between Shenyang and Changchun is good. A direct train from Shenyang to Changchun departed from Shenyang at 6:30 this morning. Furthermore, the lines from Siping to Sihekou, from Sihekou to Yonghe, from Yonghe to Changchun, and from Changchun to Siping are all clear and unobstructed.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 16th Dispatch] The Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway suffered heavy losses during the war. Currently, only the Hangzhou-Zhuji section and the Jiangshan-Shangrao section are passable. It is reported that the Ministry of Communications plans to first repair the Zhuji-Jinhua and Zhuzhou-Pingxiang sections to facilitate transportation between the three provinces of Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and Hunan. The Guangdong-Hankou Railway is currently being rushed to repair, and it is scheduled to be fully opened to traffic on July 1st. The Guangzhou-Kowloon line has been extended from Guangzhou to Foshan. Due to the extreme shortage of railway materials, the steel rails and sleepers of the Hangzhou-Ningbo and Nanjing-Wuhu railways are temporarily being dismantled and repaired. For other important railways, UNRRA will first supply railway equipment to meet our needs for restoring transportation.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City Dispatch] It is reported that the government is stepping up efforts to fully restore transportation. Hou Jiayuan, the head of the Engineering Planning Group of the Executive Yuan, flew to Nanjing with Chief Engineer Du Degao on the 12th to discuss the railway and port engineering projects in detail with Minister of Communications Yu Dawei. On the railway side, plans will be made to strengthen the transportation of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines and to repair the Guangdong-Hankou Railway so that trains can travel directly from Wuchang to Kowloon (the Guangzhou-Kowloon section has now been incorporated into the Guangdong-Hankou Railway). In addition, the Yellow River Railway Bridge on the Beijing-Hankou Railway will be rebuilt to facilitate traffic. On the port side, all ports in Huludao, Tanggu, Qingdao, and Lianyungang will be actively constructed. It is reported that after Hou returns to Shanghai, he will formulate implementation plans for the above projects.</p>

Soldiers of the regiment also expressed their regret at not being able to personally kill the enemy. They will stay in Nanjing for a few days and then go their separate ways, returning to school or finding employment.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 16th Dispatch] Shanxi Province is currently facing a widespread threat of famine. In more than ten cities and counties in Yanbei, there was no snow last winter and no rain in the spring. The land is barren for thousands of miles, and a drought has formed. Wheat in the central Shanxi area is all yellowed, and there will be little harvest. Southern Shanxi is known for its cotton production, but aphids have recently been discovered. In cities such as Datong, Taiyuan, Linfen, and Yuncheng, there are many refugees gathered to eat due to disturbances by the Communist Party in various places, causing food prices to soar.</p>

<h3 id="e14">Pauley Inspects Northeast, Says China Should Receive More Compensation <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 16th Dispatch] U.S. Reparations Commissioner Pauley hosted Chinese and foreign reporters at noon on the 16th. After Chairman Zhang Jia'ao gave an introduction, Pauley stood up and spoke. Pauley said: "Among all the Allied countries, China should receive more compensation, because China has the most right to demand compensation. Today, the whole world needs food, clothing, and various technologies to restore a stable life, but only a few places can produce more materials and transport them to other places. One is the United States, and the other is the Northeast. The purpose of our visit to the Northeast is for this purpose. We are all concerned about the issue of compensation and also concerned about Japan's overseas assets. The assets left by Japan should be used as Japan's compensation for war losses to the Allied countries. China has the right to accept the main assets of the enemy countries within its borders. The United States has announced that Japanese assets in China and the Northeast should be left in their original locations, because the United States has a major responsibility in terms of compensation. The distribution plan for Japanese overseas assets should be determined based on the economic conditions of the countries entitled to demand compensation. Today's Northeast has an important position in the world, which is the main reason for our visit to the Northeast to investigate." Pauley continued: "Marshal Marshall is currently engaged in the difficult work of striving for peace in China, and we wish him a successful completion of his mission." A reporter asked Pauley about his impressions of the inspection of various factories in Shenyang. Pauley said: "We are only here to find the facts and do not want to make any conclusions." A reporter asked Pauley whether he would visit Changchun, Harbin, and other places for inspection. He said: He had requested to go to Harbin, Anshan, and Dalian. He also said that he had requested Marshal Marshall to assist him and to negotiate with the Communist Party to allow him to inspect the areas controlled by the Communist Party. Pauley said: "If we do not go to that area, our investigation cannot be considered complete."</p>
<p>[Further Dispatch] Pauley announced to reporters the inspection schedule as follows: In the afternoon of the 16th, he will continue to inspect the Shenyang Arsenal. At 5:30, he will leave Shenyang for Fushun. On the morning of the 17th, he will visit the Fushun Coal Mine, Power Plant, and Coking Plant. At noon, he will leave Fushun for Liaoyang to inspect the Rubber Factory. On the same day, he will leave Liaoyang and go to Shenyang to Anshan. On the morning of the 18th, he will inspect the Anshan Iron and Steel Factory and return to Shenyang in the afternoon. On the morning of the 19th, he will fly to Jinzhou to inspect the factory, and in the afternoon, he will go to Huludao for inspection and return to Shenyang on the same day.</p>

<h3 id="e16">Spokesperson of the Ministry of National Defense Announces Facts of Communist China Violating the Agreement <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 16th] A spokesperson for the Ministry of National Defense, on the 15th, issued a statement saying: This Ministry issued a statement on the 11th of this month, revealing the situation of the Communist army violating orders after 12:00 noon on the 7th of this month by attacking the National Army. The purpose was to urge the Communist army to resolutely awaken, resolutely show sincerity, abide by the agreement, and quickly resolve pressing issues such as stopping the conflict, restoring transportation, and reorganization and unified compilation. However, judging from the widespread offensives launched by the Communist army in recent days, it is clear that they were pre-planned. They are no different from the Communist army's actions in violation of the agreement after the first ceasefire order was issued on January 10th of this year. Now, I will supplement the various situations from January 10th to June 7th of this year, in which the Communist army failed to comply with the agreement, violated the ceasefire order, expanded its army, moved troops without authorization, attacked and besieged cities and towns, attacked the National Army, destroyed transportation, detained and shot government and American representatives of the mediation and execution teams, so that the military and civilians of the country can jointly learn from them.</p>
<p>(1) Expanding the Army: Before the agreement on the reorganization plan, the Communist army had one general headquarters, one army headquarters, twelve division headquarters, and ten military regions. Until recently, the Communist army has expanded to two general headquarters (Northeast), fourteen army headquarters (five in the Northeast), forty-three division headquarters (nine in the Northeast), fifty-five military regions, eighty-one independent brigades (thirteen in the Northeast), and sixty-two independent regiments (excluding local teams in the Northeast and other places). Currently, the Communist army has formed the "Democratic Allied Army" in the Northeast, and in North China, it has formed eight field military regions such as "Ji-Re-Liao," "Jin-Sui," "Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu," "Jin-Ji-Cha," "Shandong," "Shaan-Gan-Ning," "Central China," and "Zhong-Zhu," as well as the "Democratic National Construction Army" and the "Democratic Second Allied Army." There are many names, and the total number of local teams and militias of the Communist army is now nearly 800,000.</p>
<p>(2) Moving Troops Without Authorization: Since the surrender of Japan until now, the Communist army has successively entered the Northeast from the provinces of Cha, Sui, Jin, and Ji via Rehe, totaling about 200,000 people. More than 80,000 people have entered the Northeast from Yantai, Longkou, and Weihaiwei in Shandong through various land and water routes. After the Northeast Execution Team arrived in Shenyang, the Communist army transferred more than 30,000 people from the border between Rehe and Ji, entering Liaoning and Chahar in the Northeast via the Qinglong River. The Communist army has repeatedly mobilized troops without authorization, attacking the National Army and attacking and besieging cities and towns, as can be seen from items (3) and (4) below.</p>
<p>(3) Attacking and Besieging Cities and Towns: The Communist army launched a full-scale offensive against the railway lines in North China, attempting to control the railways and cut off and surround the cities along the railways.

<p>[U.S. News Agency, Washington, 14th] President Truman submitted a report to Congress on the implementation of the Lend-Lease Act on the 14th. According to the report, as of the end of 1945, the total amount of assistance provided by the United States to the Allied countries reached $50 billion. The total value of reverse lend-lease materials obtained by the United States from other countries was $7.346 billion. The report revealed that since the end of the war, the United States has continued to provide lend-lease assistance to China, which aims to help the Chinese drive out the remaining Japanese troops in China. The report stated that the United States transported four Chinese armies to the eastern provinces by plane, spending approximately $300 million. The United States also lent vehicles and munitions from the supplies of the U.S. Army in the Far East to China, so that China could recover the areas occupied by more than one million remaining Japanese troops after the war. The report pointed out that the post-war lend-lease assistance to China in support of General Marshall's mission to China is consistent with President Truman's announcement on December 15, 1945, of the U.S. policy. This policy is: "Continue to maintain regular and close cooperation with the National Government of the Republic of China to complete combat missions. In order to comply with the Potsdam Declaration and eliminate Japanese influence in China, the United States has assumed definite responsibility for disarming the Japanese army and sending them back to their country.</p>
<p>President Truman also guaranteed in the message that "the United States will not militarily interfere in China's internal affairs." The report pointed out that the lend-lease work remains to be completed, and some lend-lease materials have not yet been distributed. According to the report, the value of lend-lease materials since March 11, 1941, has reached $49 billion, of which $13 billion has been lent to China.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 15th] Truman recently told Congress that since the surrender of Japan, China has received assistance worth more than $602.45 million under the U.S. Lend-Lease Act.

In the report, President Truman reiterated that the United States is unwilling to interfere in China's internal affairs with military force.</p>

The students of our military academy have served on the frontiers, never knowing rest. This time, the eight-year war of resistance relied on the arduous struggle of all our comrades and the teachers and students of this school to achieve the final victory. However, the country is still unstable, and the people's suffering still needs to be relieved. Recalling the responsibility given to us by the founding father when he founded this school, I feel deeply moved. However, with the long history of this school, the large number of teachers and students, and their sincere belief in the ideology, I believe that we will be able to overcome all difficulties and complete our mission of revolutionary nation-building. I hope everyone will remember the school motto given by the founding father when he founded the school: "Believe in the ideology and be the vanguard of the people," "One heart and one mind, from beginning to end." This principal takes this as a self-encouragement and also encourages all the teachers and students of our school. Then General Li Jishen gave a speech, stating that the work of nation-building is still arduous after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War.

Tianjin stocks continued to weaken, with Qixin at 25,60 yuan. On Friday, gold and the US dollar were weak, mainly due to tight money and the influence of Shanghai's refusal to accept speculation.

<p>[Our Anqing Dispatch] The Guangji and Guangcheng dikes in this city are vital to the lives of millions of people in Anqing and the autumn harvest of crops is deeply tied to it. As the summer flood season approaches, the Construction Department, in order to prevent problems, specially sent Director Li and Technician Sheng to Anqing together with Magistrate Ma to personally inspect the river dike and inquire about the hardships of the people.

<h3 id="e29">Passengers Inspected at Suzhou Station, Bandits Fired in Desperation <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>Deaf-Mute Man Dies from Four Gunshot Wounds</p>
<p>[Our Suzhou Dispatch] The Shanghai-Nanjing express train, delayed, arrived in Suzhou at 10:15 PM on the 13th of this month. As passengers entered Pingmen Gate, the garrison implemented an inspection. Unexpectedly, about five bandits, each in a rickshaw, entered the city. As the first rickshaw was about to be inspected, the bandit jumped out of the rickshaw, drew a pistol, and fired two shots. The other four bandits outside the city dismounted, turned around, and fled towards the Suzhou-Changzhou highway, also firing their guns. The Pingmen Road warehouse garrison troops immediately formed an encirclement. The situation was very tense at the time, with dozens of shots fired in rapid succession. At that time, Li Hongyun (28 years old), the deaf-mute son of former police bureau section chief Li Chushi, lived at No. 20 Shipin Lane. He was of a simple nature and hard of hearing. He happened to be passing the intersection of Pingmen Road and Baoyu Road. Seeing the situation, he ran forward to escape. The pursuing soldiers shouted for him to stop, but Li did not hear them, causing the soldiers to open fire. He was shot four times. One bullet hit the tiger's mouth of his right hand, shattering it, one bullet each struck his left and right waist and abdomen, and one bullet hit the upper part of his right thigh. On the morning of the 14th, his wife, Ms. Wang, identified the body and requested the district procurator's office to waive autopsy. Li Hongyun's corpse was wearing a faded white homespun short shirt and trousers, with a sweat undershirt and short trousers underneath, barefoot with cloth shoes on. Blood covered the ground. After a night of heavy rain, it was almost completely washed away. His hands and feet were swollen, his mouth and eyes were open, and his appearance was terrifying. His wife has moved the body to the funeral home outside Qimen Gate and plans to prepare a coffin for burial on the 15th.</p>
<p>Wuxi Preparing to Establish a Isolation Hospital for Epidemics</p>
<p>Since the beginning of summer, cholera has been rampant in both urban and rural areas. Based on what is known in the vicinity of the city alone, dozens of people are being infected every day and seeking treatment at various hospitals. Suddenly, saline water is in short supply, and prices have skyrocketed. Doctors are searching everywhere to procure it for use. The lives of millions of people are under serious threat. Local wealthy leaders have already implemented various epidemic prevention measures, establishing preventive vaccination stations at the station and at various gates to implement mandatory vaccinations. At the Party, Government, Military, and Civic Groups conference on the 14th, it was resolved to establish an isolation hospital to accommodate epidemic patients. However, due to the vast expense involved and the difficulty of raising funds, it was decided to send a letter to the Victory Grand Theater to add a two-hundred yuan epidemic prevention fee to each ticket.</p>
<h3 id="e30">Editorial: The Prospects for the Reopening of the Foreign Ministers' Conference <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>The foreign ministers of the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, and France reopened their conference in Paris the day before yesterday with a pleasant mood, which relieved the people around the world who hope for peace. All parties attach great importance to this conference, believing it to be a major key to whether Britain and the United States can cooperate with the Soviet Union. In particular, when US Secretary of State Byrnes flew to Paris, President Truman sent him to the airfield, which was unprecedented in American political history, showing the importance that the US government attaches to Byrnes' trip. Looking at the surrounding international environment, it is even more felt that this foreign ministers' conference is one that "can only succeed and cannot fail." If this foreign ministers' conference fails again, the future of the international political situation will be unimaginable! We were very excited to hear the news the day before yesterday that the representatives shook hands warmly with each other, and we deeply hope that there will be no more long nights and many dreams, and that happiness will not turn into disappointment again.</p>
<p>The last foreign ministers' conference ended unhappily. Although only a month has passed since its reopening, the relationship between Britain and the United States and the Soviet Union seemed to have not only not improved in the past few days, with no words of reconciliation, but had deteriorated further, with the two sides becoming increasingly estranged. For example, on the American side: (1) it seems unwilling to lend money to Poland; (2) it protested the situation in Romania; (3) it intervened in the case of former Yugoslav Army General Mihailović being accused; (4) German merchant ship fleets traveling on the Danube were detained by the US military; (5) according to the Potsdam Agreement, which stipulates that Germany should use certain industrial equipment as compensation, the US military authorities ordered the cessation of transportation. All of this, in the eyes of the Soviet Union, is nothing short of a thorn in its side, and the Soviet Union itself has also taken many unfriendly actions! (1) It has strengthened its close relationship with all countries within its sphere of influence, as evidenced by the signing of the Soviet-Polish treaty; (2) Yugoslav leader General Tito recently visited Moscow again; (3) Denmark also has a tendency to develop foreign trade to the east; (4) Recently, Soviet troops have moved from Austria to Germany; (5) The Soviet Union, Poland, and Yugoslavia did not participate in the victory parade held in Britain. In the eyes of Britain and the United States, these events also made them feel that the Soviet Union's policy of outward expansion is endless. In this month, mutual accusations between the two sides have intensified. Although their spokespersons are diplomats who understand international etiquette, they have also been very frank and straightforward in their mutual recriminations, throwing all diplomatic rhetoric to the winds. In addition, the results of the general elections in France and Italy have shown that the power of the Catholic Party is expanding in Western European countries. The "Western European Group," which has attracted worldwide attention, seems to be moving from the stage of brewing to the stage of maturity. These are all trends of "division," which will inevitably have some adverse effects on the foreign ministers' conference that seeks "unity."</p>
<p>On the day the foreign ministers' conference reopened, the entire agenda was discussed. It was decided that the peace treaties with Italy, Finland, Romania, Bulgaria, and Hungary, as well as the German question, would all be included in the agenda. However, on the Austrian question and the internal situation in Italy, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union had different opinions. Fortunately, French Foreign Minister Bidault's mediation led to a compromise, which was that the Austrian question would be discussed in general at the end of the foreign ministers' conference, and then the internal political situation in Italy would be discussed. However, if major changes occur in the Italian situation, they can also be discussed in advance. The depth of the mutual prejudices and the firmness of the attitudes of both sides can also be seen. From this perspective, the future of the four-power foreign ministers' conference still does not allow for excessive optimism. However, in terms of the current international situation, no matter from which aspect, people hope for "unity" and do not want to see "division." The "division" and "unity" of the world are tied to this meeting, but if it really evolves into "division," humanity will be no different from seeking its own destruction! However, how can Britain and the United States be made to cooperate fully with the Soviet Union? And how can Europe be prevented from splitting into two blocs, East and West? How can the world be prevented from splitting into two and allowing humanity to clash with each other using atomic bombs and other weapons?</p>
<p>When Molotov announced the Soviet Union's foreign policy to a Pravda reporter and responded to Byrnes's condemnation, he accused the United States of adopting a policy of power politics and threatening the Soviet Union with its "atomic diplomacy." From this, it can be seen that the crux of the inability of the United States and the Soviet Union to cooperate still lies in the fact that the United States is unwilling to disclose the secrets of atomic energy, which makes the Soviet Union feel "uneasy." It has no choice but to expand its "circle of friends" to seek what it considers to be reliable security. However, if the atomic energy issue is not resolved, the Soviet Union's suspicion of the United States seems impossible to eliminate.</p>
<p>According to a New York dispatch yesterday, the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission held a meeting, and US representative Baruch put forward a very important proposal, advocating that atomic energy be handed over to international institutions for control, and declaring on behalf of the United States that if an international atomic energy agency can be established, it is willing to hand over all atomic bombs for destruction and no longer manufacture them. British atomic energy experts also held a meeting in Birmingham and expressed their support for the US proposal, hoping that the international control of atomic energy will be realized as soon as possible. After this spring breeze blows to Paris, it should be able to make the foreign ministers' conference, which is full of suspicion and doubt, suddenly show a scene of peace and light. "When the mountains and rivers are exhausted, one doubts that there is no road, but the willows are dark and the flowers are bright, and another village appears!" We hope that the four powers can seize the opportunity and discuss with sincerity, so that the hostility will disappear completely and peace will be assured. We especially put forward a wish, which is: since the United States is willing to hand over atomic energy to international institutions for careful control, to eliminate mutual suspicions and fears, the Soviet Union can also stop haggling over the expansion of "safe zones" in a small area, and join the twenty-five-year alliance to jointly prevent the resurgence of Germany and Japan. Everyone should know that peace is indivisible, and only the collective security of the United Nations, and only the overall security of the world, is everyone's true security. If this can be the case, then even if there are disputes in the four-power foreign ministers' conference, they can all be easily resolved. Therefore, the United States' disclosure of the secrets of atomic energy and the Soviet Union's abandonment of its narrow concept of "safe zones" are the preconditions for the success of the four-power foreign ministers' conference, while drafting peace treaties with the enemy and so on are smaller, secondary issues.</p>

<h3 id="e32">Foreign Ministers' Conference Adjourned Yesterday; Atmosphere of First Meeting Harmonious; Austrian Question Included in Agenda <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] London, 16th Broadcasting: The four-power foreign ministers did not hold a meeting in Paris today, but were busy preparing to participate in tomorrow's meeting. The foreign ministers held informal talks on the issues of Italy and Austria.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] San Francisco, 16th Broadcasting: Moscow reports that the Danube issue was discussed at yesterday's foreign ministers' conference. The Soviet representative believed that Britain's interests in the Danube were no greater than those of other Danube countries, and that this issue should be handled by the Danube countries without external interference.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 15th] At this meeting, Byrnes, Bevin, Bidault, and Molotov all attended today's foreign ministers' conference with a friendly and optimistic attitude. When the representatives entered the venue, they were flanked by attendants and advisors, and shook hands warmly with each other. Electrical lights flashed around them, and photographers took various photos in a short period of time. (According to news from the French Embassy in Washington, French Ambassador Bonnet has been ordered to return home to participate in the meeting and assist the French delegation.)</p>
<h3 id="e33">Course of First Meeting <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 15th] The four foreign ministers held a meeting at 3:00 PM today (Greenwich Mean Time). First, French Foreign Minister Bidault delivered a welcoming speech, hoping that this beneficial work could be completed with a meeting full of cooperative spirit. He then thanked the foreign ministers of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, and the foreign ministers of each country also thanked him.</p>
<p>US Assistant Secretary of State Dunn presented a report drafted by the four foreign deputy ministers in Paris for discussion.</p>
<p>Regarding the agenda, the four foreign ministers decided to include all the issues listed on the agenda of the previous meeting in the agenda of this meeting, namely, the peace treaties with Italy, Finland, Romania, Bulgaria, and Hungary, and the German question. As for the Austrian question and the internal situation in Italy, it is planned to leave them for discussion at the end of the meeting. US Secretary of State Byrnes proposed that the Austrian peace treaty issue should also be included, but Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov raised several objections, stating that the agenda already included a large number of items and that it was not necessary to add this issue. French Foreign Minister Bidault came forward to mediate and suggested a compromise, which was that the Austrian peace treaty issue did not need to be included in the agenda, but that a general discussion on this issue should be held at the end of the meeting. At this point, Molotov proposed that the internal situation in Italy should also be discussed, on the grounds that according to the armistice agreement of 1943, the Allied countries had guaranteed that all remnants of fascism must be eradicated, and that according to the protocol of May 16, 1946, the Allied countries also had the right to monitor the development of Italian internal affairs. Recently, disturbances have occurred in that country, and the remnants of fascism and neo-fascists have been active everywhere, and their future consequences are very concerning. After a long discussion, agreement was reached, deciding that the Austrian problem would be put forward for discussion first. After the meeting was declared to be over, the problem of Italian domestic politics will be discussed again, but if major changes occur in the Italian political situation, the four foreign ministers may also discuss them in advance. Regarding the Italian economic issue, Molotov also proposed that it be submitted for discussion, and requested the Italian government to submit its views on the economic terms of the future treaty. British Foreign Minister Bevin immediately raised an objection, stating that it would not be logical to solicit intentions before the twenty-one-nation peace conference had been convened. Molotov replied that the opinions of the Italian government had already been solicited when the boundary issue was discussed at the last foreign ministers' conference, and that there was already a precedent for this. But Molotov also withdrew the above proposal, and the four-power foreign ministers' conference adjourned at 5:40 PM and continued at 3:00 PM on the 17th of this month.</p>

<p>Plan to Prevent Nazis from Revival Submitted to Foreign Ministers' Conference; Suggests that the Ruhr Area be Entrusted to the UN Security Council for 30 Years</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 13th] The International Committee for the Study of European Problems issued a report today stating that Germany's ability to wage war is still higher than that of its neighbors in 1938. Under the current Allied control system, it is feared that there is no possibility of weakening it. It is reported that its conclusions are based on all Allied official documents and documents discovered after the German surrender. The report said that since March 28, 1945, Hitler, upon the advice of his Minister of Armaments, Speer, changed his original intention to completely destroy Germany after the defeat. Speer believed that Germany would eventually have fully equipped industry and manpower even under Allied occupation in order to fight again. We now examine the population and industrial figures of Germany, as well as the power of Nazi ideas, and deeply believe that Speer's words are indeed reasonable. In its current state, there is still no sign of ending for a while. The committee has drafted a plan to prevent the revival of the Nazis and submitted it to the Paris Foreign Ministers' Conference. Among those who may draw the attention of the Foreign Ministers' Conference starting tomorrow is the suggestion that the Ruhr area be entrusted to the United Nations Security Council for twenty years and that the Ruhr area be governed and controlled by a trustee committee composed of France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Britain, the United States, and other countries. As for the four governments, the Allied Control Committee in Berlin and the Security Council are actually ultimately responsible for the Ruhr. The plan supports the British proposal to establish a German federation. After thirty years, if the United Nations agency believes that Germany has reached a level where it can be re-educated, then the Ruhr can be gradually returned to Germany. The suggestion pointed out that the Nazis killed 15 million people from other countries, while the population of their country increased by 7.5 percent after World War I, which is also a dangerous situation. Therefore, it is hoped that United Nations agencies can supervise the population policies of various countries in the world. For example, in countries with sparse populations such as France and Australia, they should be encouraged to reproduce, while countries with dense populations such as Germany and Japan should be restricted.</p>

<h3 id="e40">Truman Submits to Congress the Army-Navy Merger Act - The Entire Plan Consists of Twelve Points <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>[United Press International, Washington, 15th] The State Department announced that President Truman today submitted a bill to Congress advocating the unification of the U.S. Army, Navy, and Air Force under a Department of Defense. The entire plan consists of twelve points, incorporating the opinions of the Army and Navy departments, as well as the President's arbitration methods for key points on which agreement could not be reached. Secretary of the Army Patterson and Secretary of the Navy Forrestal have agreed to accept the President's decision on disputed points. In a letter to key members of the Army and Navy committees of both houses of Congress, the President released his proposed recommendations, stating that this plan has been unconditionally endorsed by both the Army and Navy departments and guaranteed their support. According to the proposed plan, the Army, Navy, and Air Force would be unified under a single Department of Defense, each headed by a civilian Secretary, each retaining internal administrative autonomy, and a National Defense Council would be established to unify U.S. military and foreign policy. In addition, a National Security Resources Board, central intelligence agency, and supply agencies would be established. The key points of the President's plan are listed below: (The first four points are those on which the Army and Navy departments could not reach agreement).</p>
<p>(1) Establish a single military department headed by a non-military person as the leader, and a member of the Cabinet as the Secretary of Defense.</p>
<p>(2) The Army, Navy, and Air Force shall be parallel and civil, each with a Secretary, all subject to the control and supervision of the Secretary of Defense. These three Secretaries will not be in the Cabinet, and the Army, Navy, and Air Force will be equal as two-in-one entities, each managing its internal administration. (The Army Department has also endorsed this agreement, but the Navy Department has requested preservation of its autonomy and Cabinet status).</p>
<p>(3) The Air Force shall be responsible for developing, acquiring, maintaining, and using U.S. military aviation resources, but naval aircraft and seaplanes shall remain under naval control.</p>
<p>(4) Preserve the Marine Corps as part of the Navy.</p>
<p>(5) Establish a National Defense Council, with the Secretary of State, the non-military head of the military agencies, the heads of the military departments, and the Chairman of the National Security Resources Board as members.</p>
<p>(6) The National Security Resources Board shall formulate and support policies and plans for maximizing the utilization of U.S. resources to uphold national security.</p>
<p>(7) The Joint Chiefs of Staff shall assume responsibility for strategy and calculations, similar to the current staff agencies.</p>
<p>(8) Do not appoint a single Chief of Staff.</p>
<p>(9) An intelligence agency, under the National Defense Council, shall analyze and estimate intelligence collected by various government agencies (including military).</p>
<p>(10) Joint planning and coordination, disposition, production, and distribution, in order to avoid "wasteful competition."</p>
<p>(11) Research agencies shall coordinate scientific research and military development.</p>
<p>(12) Military education and training shall periodically review and adjust the system for educating and training military personnel to form a unified plan.</p>

<p>Accepting Government Mediation, Labor and Management Reach a Compromise</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 15th, United Press] Leaders of the U.S. Marine and Dockworkers Union accepted the government's wage and working hour settlement plan this morning. This resolution came just minutes after 200,000 union workers in major ports along the East Coast launched a full-scale strike. The union's agreement statement arrived too late, so local unions in New York, Boston, Philadelphia, Jacksonville, Florida, and other locations failed to stop their work stoppages at midnight.

<p>Soviet Union Claims Refugee Issue Has Political Significance</p>
<p>[United Press International, New York, 15th] At today's meeting of the United Nations Economic and Social Council, British, American, and Soviet representatives engaged in a heated debate. Soviet Representative Fyodorov argued that the issue of displaced persons and refugees now has political significance, and that the United Kingdom and the United States do not wish to make certain facts public. Fyodorov resolutely opposed Yugoslavia's request to investigate European refugee camps. British Representative McNeil directly addressed the Soviet Representative, stating: "Mr. Fyodorov, you know that there is an existing arrangement to investigate refugee camps. The suffering and poverty of refugees must be subject to police investigation." U.S. Representative Winant also replied to Fyodorov, stating that the United States has never used the plight of refugees for political motives, and that various concentration camps in the U.S. occupation zone have been the target of investigations by other countries. Previously, the Yugoslav representative requested the dispatch of a United Nations commission to conduct on-site investigations of various refugee camps, claiming that the camps harbor rebels and train deserters from the Yugoslav army. After the Belgian representative spoke, Fyodorov stated: "I do not know why investigating these camps would be dangerous. Certain parties are concealing certain facts and do not want the truth to come out."</p>

<p>Communist Party Opposes Bidault Forming a Cabinet</p>
<p>[United Press International, Paris, 15th] A serious political crisis has occurred again in France. The Communist Party intends to obstruct the formation of a government led by Georges Bidault, the leader of the Popular Republican Movement and Minister of Foreign Affairs. During a meeting of the Party's Central Executive Committee today, speakers advocated a return to the previous three-party coalition cabinet, led by a member of the Socialist Party, and demanded seats in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Interior, and the Ministry of State. When de Gaulle attempted to form a cabinet last year, he encountered this crisis.</p>

<p>Orr believes that international cooperation to relieve famine is as important as controlling atomic energy</p>
<p>[United Press International, Washington, 15th] Secretary of Agriculture Anderson stated in a broadcast tonight that the United States does not need to restore rationing in order to rescue starving people worldwide. The Director of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, Orr, said that if major producing countries can continue to implement wartime controls, famine can be avoided. Anderson also agreed with him. The world food situation will remain precarious until at least the autumn harvest of 1947. If they want to restore normal production, they must look forward to a few years. Orr proposed establishing an International Food Planning Bureau to allow countries with surpluses or deficiencies to be regulated. The solution to the food problem is almost as important to world peace as managing atomic energy. Therefore, a far-sighted International Food Planning Bureau should be established to eliminate famine around the world.</p>

<p>[Reuters, London, 15th] Since the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, Husseini, left Paris, the authorities have ordered all regions to prevent him from sneaking into the Middle East. A cable from Cairo today stated that the British transport ship "Teviotbank" was searched by a British destroyer outside Port Said. The British Navy Department announced that the British government has taken all possible measures to prevent Husseini from reaching the Middle East. [Reuters, Port Said, 15th] The British Navy Department announced that after inspecting the transport ship "Teviotbank" outside Port Said yesterday, it has not dispelled the belief among people here that the Grand Mufti is in the hands of the British authorities. Everyone believes that after the destroyer "Virago" inspected "Teviotbank," it sailed to the Suez Canal and has taken the Grand Mufti to the world-famous exile site, the Seychelles Islands. The mystery of how the Grand Mufti boarded the transport ship "Teviotbank" (if this is indeed the case) has not yet been resolved.

<p>Concurrently Commander Xuan Tiewu Solemnly States "Will Never Show Favoritism with the Law"</p>
<p>[This Newspaper Report] Wang Daren, a specialist commissioner of the Grain Administration Special Commissioner's Office of the Ministry of Food in Shanghai, and concurrently acting director, was transferred to the Songhu Garrison Command Military Law Office for temporary detention at approximately 2:00 PM on the 15th, after being summoned for questioning on the afternoon of the 14th. It is reported that Wang was summoned at his private residence at approximately 7:00 PM on the afternoon of the 14th. Immediately afterwards, the interrogation personnel went to the Grain Administration Office to retrieve the relevant grain loan case files. The Shanghai District Court Inspection has scheduled a preliminary hearing for 10:00 AM today, summoning Yang Xizhi, Wang Daren, Ren Xingya, and Li Chongnian, four grain officials, as well as the persons in charge of the rice merchants involved in the grain loans. However, Yang Xizhi is currently still in the United States and has not returned, and there have been no reports of Ren and Li coming to Shanghai for questioning. It is still unknown whether they will be able to appear in court as summoned at that time. The Garrison Command Military Law Office has also decided to summon the persons in charge of the fourteen grain loan rice merchants separately starting today.</p>
<p>It is also reported that concurrently Commander Xuan declared yesterday that some of the main perpetrators in the grain loan embezzlement case will be subject to severe military law sanctions. Xuan explained that non-military criminals should originally be tried by ordinary judicial organs, but the circumstances of this case are serious and cannot be constrained by ordinary law, so he has been ordered to implement military law trials for a portion of the perpetrators in this case. Xuan refused to announce the names of those who should be subject to military law trials in this case, but he solemnly stated that all those with serious criminal suspicions will be strictly investigated and dealt with, and will not show favoritism due to their "special" backgrounds or identities. He repeatedly stated, "Will never show favoritism with the law."</p>

<p>Discussing Plans to Resume Work in Enemy and Puppet Factories</p>
<p>Representatives of rear area factories Xie Dasha, Ye Zhu, Hu Yunfu, Wo Shuyan, Chen Baiquan, etc., noting the increasing number of workers arriving in Shanghai, the lack of work, and the failure to resume factory operations, prepared two plans for the resumption of work in the hundred or so enemy and puppet factories that are still closed down, and sent them to Minister of Economic Affairs Wang Yunwu. Yesterday, after Minister Wang arrived in Shanghai from Beijing, he immediately summoned representatives Xie Dasha and others to his private residence. In addition to expressing his condolences and encouragement for the contributions of the various factories during the War of Resistance, and urging them to continue to work hard to build the national industry in the future, he also discussed the plans in detail. According to the plans, there are two categories: joint operation and agency operation. The joint operation method has been widely implemented in enemy and puppet factories in the Guangzhou area. It uses the original factory buildings, machinery, etc., with public shares. The people raise raw materials, workers, and working capital to become a special joint-stock company. The agency operation also adopts the company method, but the share capital is temporarily wholly owned by the government, and gradually sold to private factories to avoid reducing efficiency due to institutionalization and enable rapid commencement of work. If either of the above methods is adopted by the authorities, the hundred or so enemy and puppet factories that have been closed for nine months can gradually resume work, accommodating more than ten thousand workers. In a negative sense, it can also reduce the monthly unemployment worker relief fund of tens of millions of yuan.</p>

Yesterday, according to the Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, Mr. Wu Kaixian, told reporters: Earlier reports stated that Minister of Economic Affairs Wang will convene a National Economic Conference in Beijing. The content of the discussions at these two conferences is roughly similar, and the people invited to participate from various circles are also roughly similar. Therefore, if the Economic Conference can be convened in the near future, it would be uneconomical to convene two conferences with similar natures within a month. Therefore, Mr. Wu telegraphed Minister Wang yesterday to inquire about his opinion. If the National Economic Conference can be convened, then the Production Conference will not be held, and the collected reference materials will be forwarded to the National Economic Conference for reference. If the Economic Conference is not convened immediately, then the Production Conference will still be held at the end of this month. The people invited to participate include 200 to 300 people from the economic, industrial, commercial, and banking sectors.</p>

<h3 id="e65">Situ Meitang Talks About His Impressions of Returning to China, Living in America is Five to Six Times Cheaper Than Shanghai, Remittances from Overseas Chinese are Not Enough to Solve the Problem <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Yesterday, this reporter visited Situ Meitang, an 80-year-old leader of overseas Chinese and a senator who lived in the United States for sixty years and recently came to Shanghai. He is very energetic and healthy. He told us that his deepest impression of returning to China is that the cost of living in Shanghai is too high, making it difficult for ordinary people to maintain their livelihoods. In the past, during the concession era, attention was paid to public health. He hopes that the Municipal Bureau of Public Works and the Health Bureau will continue their efforts. The current cost of living in the United States is on average five to six times lower than in Shanghai, while the wages earned by American workers are actually higher than those earned by Chinese workers in the past. In terms of transportation costs, it is even more expensive in China than in the United States, making people's lives inevitably difficult. The most important thing now is for all parties and factions to cooperate sincerely, stop the civil war, and seek peace as soon as possible, for the welfare of the nation, so that a new China can be built soon. After eight years of hard fighting, China is no longer afraid of being divided by the great powers, but what is most terrifying is that the Chinese themselves want to divide China! This makes overseas Chinese extremely worried. Currently, the American business community and some overseas Chinese, in view of the current civil war situation in China, although they have the intention to invest, they hesitate to move forward, because there is no sufficient guarantee in this situation.</p>
<p>Unbearable Memories of the Past</p>
<p>I went to the United States more than sixty years ago, still wearing a queue (braid), and suffered much humiliation. After the establishment of the Republic of China, the treatment of overseas Chinese improved slightly. During the eight years of the War of Resistance against Japan, Americans greatly admired China's perseverance and unwavering resistance, and their respect for overseas Chinese increased. In order to assist the war, I presided over the "Fundraising Association" in the United States, and Americans also donated enthusiastically. What was most heartbreaking during the war was the matter of remittances from overseas Chinese. When overseas Chinese remitted money from the United States back to China, five US dollars were only worth 100 legal tender yuan. Later, although it increased to one US dollar for 500 legal tender yuan, in reality, if exchanged at foreign banks, the price could be one US dollar for more than six yuan in national currency. Overseas Chinese suffered a great loss. After the money was handed over to the five-nation banks, the remittances to Taishan, Xinhui, Kaiping, and other places took several years to arrive. Relatives of overseas Chinese starved to death due to the interruption of aid, which made overseas Chinese want to cry but have no tears!</p>
<p>Reviving the Hongmen, Seeking Joint Development</p>
<p>This time, I returned to China not only to see the victory but also to strengthen the Hongmen. I am the chairman of the Hongmen Zhi Gong Party headquarters. Most of the overseas Chinese in the United States are Hongmen brothers. In the past, the Hongmen made great contributions to the nation and the country, sacrificing countless lives and spending countless money to help achieve the miraculous success of the Xinhai Revolution. After the establishment of the Republic of China, they retired after their success and no longer participated in national affairs. Unexpectedly, the country has reached such a state of hardship for the people! This time, reviving the Hongmen is to unite the brothers and jointly shoulder the heavy responsibility of construction, increase production capacity, and enable people to live and work in peace. However, the prerequisite for living and working in peace is to ensure that everyone has adequate clothing, food, and housing. If the problem of livelihood can be solved, it will be easier to get on the right track. Mr. Situ's name is Xian, and his courtesy name is Meitang. He is from Kaiping, Guangdong. He went to San Francisco at the age of fourteen and joined the Hongmen Zhi Gong Tang at the age of seventeen. He is selfless and righteous and highly respected by overseas Chinese in the United States. In his early years, he supported Sun Yat-sen and opposed Chen Jiongming, making great contributions. After the War of Resistance against Japan, he presided over the Fundraising Association, continuously supplying the motherland, achieving the best results among overseas Chinese. In the 31st year of the Republic of China (1942), he was commissioned by the government to comfort overseas Chinese in the United States, and was warmly welcomed. Recently, he returned to China to prepare for the Zhi Gong Party Congress. He has met with the Chairman in Nanjing, who gave him a personal audience and greatly encouraged him.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper] The Shanghai Drama and Film Association's Committee for Reporting Film and Theater Personnel Who Collaborated With the Enemy drafted principles for reporting some time ago, printed reporting forms and lists, and distributed them widely to film and theater personnel throughout the city, in order to collect ideas and gather opinions. Yesterday at 2:00 PM, representatives of the association went to the Zheng Bureau to open mailbox No. 1396, seal the letters, and schedule a date to open the ballots, count them, and study them. For the sake of caution, the association will continue to receive letters and evidence of reports, and clarified three points: (1) The testing and investigation of this reporting form is only a preliminary work, and the statistical results are not an official list of those who collaborated with the enemy. (2) The list of those who collaborated with the enemy that will be published in the future will only be provided to the authorities for reference, with no extreme punishment. (3) The association expressed regret that the government failed to provide assistance to the association, and that collaborators with unclear identities, such as Han Langan, participated in filming.</p>
<h3 id="e69">A Gathering of Great Historical Significance: Public Memorial to Martyrs at Cuixiu Hall, Comrades of the Merchant Corps Relive Old Times <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Merchant Corps Comrades Association of the Xinhai Revolution held a gathering yesterday at the Cuixiu Hall of the Yimiao Temple to commemorate the revolutionary martyrs of the Merchant Corps who died in the line of duty, take a group photo, and dine together, in order to relive old times and to build a memorial hall and compile a historical record. More than 200 people attended, including Zhu Shaoyi, the former commander of the Shanghai Merchant Corps, members of the Shangyu Society, the Qingzhen Merchant Corps, and members of various trade associations. Guests invited to participate included Dean Yu Youren, Chen Qicai, Hu Puan, Pan Gongzhan, Wu Shaoshu, Zhang Cheng, and others. After a group photo, a dinner was held. During the dinner, Dean Yu, Hu Puan, Wu Shaoshu, and Zhang Chenghun delivered speeches one after another. Dean Yu, in a passionate and stirring tone, encouraged the comrades to continue their efforts with the spirit of being old but strong, and to remain loyal to the Three Principles of the People and carry out the revolutionary mission. Hu Puan said that the youth of the past are now old, and the youth of today will also become old in the future, so the youth of today should seize the present, strive hard, and work diligently. Wu Shaoshu expressed his admiration for the revolutionary predecessors present, saying that although they are old, their revolutionary spirit is no less than in those years, and the young comrades should follow in the footsteps of their predecessors and continue to shoulder the arduous task of revolutionary nation-building. Zhu Shaoyi gave a reply, detailing the Shanghai Merchant Corps' assistance to General Chen Yingshi in attacking the Manufacturing Bureau and liberating Shanghai 35 years ago, which are all invaluable historical materials of heroism. The audience was extremely excited and responded with warm applause. There was also entertainment after the meal, and the gathering dispersed around 3:00 PM. At that time, the Shanghai Merchant Corps was organized automatically by citizens. Their participation in the revolution was purely out of patriotic enthusiasm, sacrificing themselves without seeking fame or gain. Their spirit of loyalty and integrity is worthy of admiration. The revolutionary history of the Merchant Corps is now 35 years in the past. Therefore, most of the members who attended the meeting yesterday were elderly people with gray hair. The youngest among them was also past the age of fifty. They looked back on the past and could not help but be filled with emotion. At a time when the country is in turmoil and the people are demoralized, this gathering with great revolutionary and historical significance makes one feel a sense of "darkness before dawn."</p>

<p>The curfew in the city was officially lifted at midnight on the 15th. Yesterday, this reporter met with the person in charge of the police bureau and asked about the state of public security after the curfew was lifted. He said that the situation was not satisfactory, as there were seven or eight robbery cases the night before last. The responsible parties have decided to increase the police force to ensure public security. In addition to the original 2,000 police officers in the urban area, 1,800 members of the Security Corps will be reorganized into a Security Police Brigade, specializing in maintaining public security at night. It was also learned that the director of the Police Training School was originally held concurrently by Director Xuan, but Director Xuan is now too busy with political affairs to handle both duties. He has submitted a request to resign from the post, which has been approved, and Deputy Director Yu Shuping has been appointed to concurrently hold the position. The handover procedures were completed at the Yulin Road Police Training School at 9:00 AM yesterday.</p>
<h3 id="e73">"Shanghai Nights" After the Curfew is Lifted, Scrambling for Business Outside Dance Halls, Stepping on Ants on Avenue Joffre <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>Maybe you don't need to walk on the streets after 12 o'clock every night, but for many Shanghai people, they haven't gotten used to going to bed early and getting up early in the past eight or nine years. Moreover, occasionally encountering some social events or urgent matters, wanting to walk on the road but not being able to, always feels inconvenient.</p>
<p>Three or four days ago, I saw in the newspaper that "the curfew will not be lifted for the time being." Who knew that two days later, with a "decree," this "sleepless city" that had been in "night" for many years began to revive. I wouldn't dare say that this is "good news" or "good fortune," but at least it is a matter of convenience for the citizens, especially allowing those who make a living from newspapers to worry less.</p>
<p>Half out of curiosity, and half because I was conveniently dropping people off in my car, I made a round of the streets on the first night after the curfew was lifted. East to Tilanqiao, south to Xiaoximen, then around Nanjing Road to Haig Road, and then a sightseeing tour of Avenue Joffre. The result proved that this "sleepless city" was indeed reviving, although it was still in its early stages.</p>
<p>Probably because it was Saturday, the Bund was especially lively. American sailors were returning "drunk" in groups of twos and threes. Although the rickshaws were empty, they could still find customers to ride to the west. The reporting sound from the loudspeakers on the Bund pier and the surrounding lights seemed especially "loud" and "bright." This lively scene therefore affected all the way to Tilanqiao. In the past, Hongkou and other areas would have been as quiet as a deep valley at this time, but now it was surprisingly noisy, and I kept hearing "Rickshaw? Rickshaw?" "Pedicab? Pedicab?"</p>
<p>Walking into Nanshi, it was also very different from the night before. In addition to the lights in front of each household, many food shops were still open, and the song "A Mother's Heart" from the radio could be heard from 150 meters away.</p>
<p>Running to the urban area again, there were more stalls on the road than during the day, especially on the cross streets or at corners, where the lights shone, simply blinding people. On the fruit stall, a Florida tangerine looked extraordinarily bright from afar. The wonton stall owner no longer needed to tap his melancholic bamboo clapper to find customers. The cold noodle stall was full of customers, with the owners barely keeping up with the demand. The cold drink stall owner, busy all day, still had to sell large quantities of orange juice at night. However, the apprentices in those shop alleys could take a break at this time, finding a neighbor, moving a few stools, crossing their legs, talking about legends and stories, and enjoying the cool breeze, with a sense of leisure and contentment.</p>
<p>Needless to say, Nanjing Road was busy, where one could normally drive full throttle, and the intersection of Xizang Road and Nanjing Road, after the curfew was lifted, immediately became prosperous. Cars had to stop for one or two minutes at the intersection to get through. The rickshaw pullers in front of the Xianle Dance Hall could even fight to snatch customers. The guests staggered out, seeming to resent that it had closed too early.</p>
<p>In comparison, the poetic Avenue Joffre did not lose its original character. There were far fewer vehicles, the wonton and noodle vendors had no way to perform their signature stunts, and there were few pedestrians. But occasionally, you could find a few couples of young people who liked to step on ants under the moonlight, not knowing whether they were going home or just going out!</p>
<p>After the curfew was lifted, the most unlucky people were the police, who had to carry their guns high and pace back and forth. In addition to them, the American military police were working even harder than before, with a jeep in the east and a jeep in the west. Moreover, they would only stop in the center of the road, using flashlights to inspect every jeep that passed, in an extraordinarily tense manner.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that in a few days, in the stillness of midnight, you might as well take a stroll on the road, and you will definitely hear the sound of mahjong games and be able to appreciate beautiful music. Who says Shanghai is in a slump? Shanghai people's new tricks are already ready, and in the near future, you will see that Shanghai's late night is even more prosperous than it was eight years ago (Mai Tian).</p>

Guo Moruo briefly stated: "For education to be good, the country must first have peace. Currently, in our country's budget, only 4.7% is spent on education, while 46% is spent on military affairs. In comparison, it's like a drop in the bucket. Under such circumstances, how can teachers' lives be guaranteed? We want to increase education funding to more than 30% and demand a rapid reduction in military spending. We oppose the use of political ideology to interfere in educational administration. If we truly respect teachers, then teachers should have all true freedom, and only in an atmosphere of freedom can we create broad-minded talents."

<p>[Our Newspaper, Kunming, 10th] According to Professor John Ma, a veteran of the sports world: Sports people across the country are now planning to restore the Far Eastern Athletic Association and will invite various countries in the Far East to participate.</p>
<h3 id="e106">Evening <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>— Luo Hong</p>
<p>When you are still wearing soft pajamas, standing at the window with a sleepy look, facing the bright morning sky, inhaling fresh air, watching one or two wisps of thin clouds drifting lazily by, or watching small flocks of birds flying gracefully in the morning breeze, that is truly the most leisurely thing. If you wake up from a dream, peeking through the gap in the curtains at a large patch of azure, listening to the faint sound of the city coming from afar, you can reach for a favorite book on the pillow and read, or hum a favorite song idly, what a charming scene that is!</p>
<p>However, for those of us who bear the heavy burden of life, where can we find such leisurely days? Squeezed by life, we are often so burdened that we can hardly breathe. During the Anti-Japanese War, in many small cities in the interior, I saw those thin horses carrying overly heavy objects, walking long distances, their heads drooping, silently enduring the burden. It is said that these skinny horses are used exclusively for transporting goods. By analogy, how are people different from these poor skinny horses? For the sake of life, the burden we carry is really not light. Every day, we are just arranging to pass the days quickly, letting the burden of life weigh us down, squeezing ourselves under the giant wheel of existence. Only in the evening can we give ourselves a breather, sit lazily in my chair, watching the branches blown by the evening breeze in the distance, looking at the setting sun hanging on the corner of the wall, indulging in a few comfortable breaths of air. All the dreams of hope also float up at this time, finding a little self-deprecating comfort in the burden of life.</p>
<p>Therefore, in any season, I often love the evening the most, and I love the evenings of summer and autumn even more. The summer evenings are especially beautiful, making people feel so cool and gorgeous. If you wear a light, thin garment, standing under the shade of a tree or next to a low fence, letting the evening breeze play with your short hair and the corners of your clothes, that is much cooler than sitting in a coffee shop eating shaved ice. Moreover, the azure sky, rendered by the setting sun into quite beautiful clouds, makes people feel a gentle pleasure when looking at it.</p>
<p>In the past few years of refugee life, it was rare to stay in one place for half a year or a year. Often, we would travel during the day, our minds reeling from the jolting of the highway buses, or in a sailboat, feeling so bored that we just wanted to doze all day. So, when we rested in a place in the evening, we washed away the dust, let our tired bodies bathe in the sunset, and appreciated the different twilight scenes of various places, which was considered the only enjoyment in life. Perhaps it is because of this that I feel especially close to the evening.</p>
<p>I also love the autumn evenings, their quiet demeanor and slightly melancholic atmosphere, so easily reminding people of the past, and gently evoking many aspirations. Life is so fleeting and mysterious. A person who is committed to life and unwilling to easily bow to it is also prone to feeling disappointed in everything. This disappointment does not necessarily make a person negative, make them resentful, but it is very likely to make a person silent, and many aspirations float in their heart. Like me, a person who feels uncomfortable everywhere in life, of course, can only confide my innermost thoughts to the quiet twilight. So, often after a day of fatigue, I sit in my *** chair, take a deep breath, as if blowing away all the troubles of the day, silently watching the evening sky, watching flocks of flying birds skimming past my window.</p>

<p>— Zhao Qingge</p>
<p>The New Year holidays are over, and Xiao Hong's new life has also begun. Now she handles everything: cooking, washing clothes, sewing, and taking care of the boss's beloved son. But she has no complaints; she regards all of this as her duty; she should work. In this family, she has become familiar with everyone, except for Liao Dong—her future husband—who is still unfamiliar; and so unfamiliar that she hardly sees him every day. If she happens to encounter him, Liao Dong acts as if she doesn't exist, without any sign of recognition! Let alone trying to strike up a conversation. Therefore, Xiao Hong thinks: "Why does he ignore me?" She is quite puzzled! But she cannot ask Liao Dong. Several times she saw Liao Dong's clothes were dirty, and she prepared to ask him to take them off so she could wash them for him, but she couldn't bring herself to say it! Firstly, she was afraid of being embarrassed, and secondly, she was afraid Liao Dong would blame her for being presumptuous. In her little heart, she is constantly worrying about this stranger-like future husband.</p>
<p>Now, Yuan Chun Tang has already tightened its belt. Only Bao Ling and a Master Li, who creates medicines, are left in the shop. Therefore, they have to do the work of several people. Although business is still sluggish, there are still quite a few things to do. Bao Ling has even become a general helper. Besides keeping accounts, he is responsible for wrapping the medicine when customers buy it, after Master Li has weighed the portions. Every day, he also has to wipe the tables and sweep the floor. Moreover, the boss's wife constantly orders him to run errands, acting as a "general assistant," (a mahjong term) with no free time from morning to night. Bao Ling endures all of this! Because his goal is to "support himself," to earn a living by his own labor. This is not a disgrace; he is willing to suffer; this is training! That's what he thinks. Like Xiao Hong, he has no complaints. Sometimes Liao Dong can't bear to watch and helps him with something, but Bao Ling often refuses. He tells Liao Dong: "Only those who can endure hardship can be independent and can walk without fear of falling." Although he says this, he feels very sad in his heart! What makes him sad is: If the old master had lived a few more years, he could have studied for a few more years, then his prospects would have been broader, and he wouldn't have had to do this kind of hard labor. But now, he can only work hard for others, one could even say he is a slave! A beast of burden!</p>
<p>Heaven "helps the wicked and mistreats," working against the poor. The winter wasn't very cold, then suddenly a spring cold like a fierce tiger pounced on Jingzhou with great ferocity! After a heavy snow, the house would freeze. The northwest wind, blowing on the face, felt like small knives cutting you painfully. People's ears were frozen into red, swollen rotten oranges, people's hands and feet were frozen into wood; the snot flowed down, and if you didn't wipe it away after a while, it would freeze into two glass rods; dangling on the upper lip. But this was only so severe for some people; some people didn't care at all. Because they could go out wearing fur coats and warm themselves by the brazier at home, the cold could not invade their bodies, so they would not think about how those suffering in the icy and snowy weather were being threatened! For example, the boss's wife, she wears a sheepskin coat and keeps a brazier burning in the house. She herself is like a warm current, and when she walks beside you, you feel warm. Even though her heart is so cold that it makes you shiver!</p>
<p>Recently, the boss's wife has returned to her normal state (not very elegant, anger is her normal state; happiness and peace are her abnormality). Except for Boss Liao and Liao Dong, everyone else in the family, big and small, has become a non-human animal in her eyes. Especially towards Xiao Hong, she has not only forgotten that she will be the future eldest daughter-in-law of this family, but also forgotten that she is a human being with flesh and blood! The short period of polite and preferential treatment has passed. Now, from morning to night, the boss's wife cannot let Xiao Hong's hands and feet rest for a moment.</p>

<p>Problems in Hygiene Training for Primary School Students</p>
<p>A hygiene subject should be added to the primary school curriculum. We should not have any extravagant hopes; it is enough for children to understand some of the most basic hygiene knowledge and maintain their personal health. The arrangement of this scientific teaching material can be divided into three stages: elementary, intermediate, and advanced, according to the cyclical method (circular method) of textbook compilation. Each stage should still be divided into volumes one, two, three, and four, according to the distribution of textbooks, making it easy to difficult, so that children's life knowledge can progress from shallow to deep, and then to even deeper, without any psychological difficulty, and achieve their final goal of maintaining their own health. Only in this way can the meaning of education not be lost. (Fan Jiagui, 35.6.130)</p>
<p>Children fundamentally have no interest in subjects with such a strong educational color as hygiene. If training is implemented, it will instead foster a sense of disgust in children. I propose that the stories in the language arts subject, the lyrics in the music subject, and the appreciation books in the art subject should try to incorporate teaching material on hygiene, which is easier to increase teaching efficiency by instilling it to children invisibly (Shi Debang 35.6.13, Anqing)</p>
<p>The list of hygiene training items is up to one hundred and thirty-five items, which is indeed too tedious. In reality, it would be enough if all the students of a primary school could achieve the two basic hygiene items of "neatness" and "cleanliness." Being simple and easy, achieving twice the result with half the effort, I ask the education authorities to start from this simple aspect. (Yang Liuqing, 35.6.14, Hangzhou)</p>

<h3 id="e111">The Tragedy of the Old Man (Fiction) (Part 1) <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>— Tian Qin</p>
<p>Before the old man became an old man, he had a very decent son. Although he had not read much, he could write accounts or write sale contracts, pawn contracts, and loan notes—those property-related things that were closely related to the farmers. Therefore, not only his father—no, let's just call him the old man. Even all the uncles and elders in the village thought his son was promising. The old man was of course overjoyed to have such a son.</p>
<p>However, the old man did not have any "property." Even after his wife passed away, he was unable to remarry. His property was his only son—Si Dai.</p>
<p>The old man took his son to the fields all day long, crawling (robe) in the soil for food all year round. However, a poor household with no land to stand on cannot withstand drought or floods, no matter how hard they work. And there was the land rent that had to be paid on time as usual... These heavy burdens made it impossible for him to breathe.</p>
<p>Don't think that the old man lived a hard life, but he had to enjoy himself every now and then. Of course, there was nothing to eat in the countryside. In fact, his desires were not high, and he didn't want to eat anything delicious at all. At most, he would drink two ounces of Laobaigan. He had a bit of a stutter, but that didn't matter. Although his stutter was worse after drinking, once his "talk box" was opened, it simply couldn't be closed.</p>
<p>After drinking, he only had the problem of talking too much, but his mind was still relatively clear. So, his son-teaching lesson was often taught after drinking.</p>
<p>I don't remember what day it was, but after the father and son finished their work in the fields, the sun had just begun to set. The old man discovered that there were many fish jumping in the trench, so he quietly told Si Dai to quickly bring the five-pronged iron fork that was placed on the boat. Si Dai understood his father's meaning and went straight to the boat to get the fork without saying a word.</p>
<p>After the old man got the iron fork, he stood on a ridge near the river, his eyes as round as saucers, staring intently at the emerald green water surface. When ripples appeared on the water surface, with a "peng" sound, the iron fork pierced into the bottom of the water, and immediately a carp weighing two or three pounds was lifted up. The old man smiled, using a green Tibetan reed as a rope, piercing through the fish gills, tying a knot, carrying the fish in one hand and the fork in the other, and walked towards his small boat with a small amount of sweat on his forehead.</p>
<p>When his father was spearing fish, Si Dai hid alone in the boat reading the borrowed "Seven Heroes and Five Gallants." He was so engrossed in reading that he didn't even see his father when the old man was about to board the boat. Si Dai's fascination was that great. When the old man's foot stepped on the bow of the boat, it naturally swayed two or three times, and this startled the son out of his daze.</p>
<p>He raised his head in a corner of the stern and looked at his father's posture and couldn't help but laugh out loud.</p>
<p>"Dad! You really got it."</p>
<p>"Si Dai, today your dad will have wine to drink,"</p>
<p>"What? Dad, aren't we going to cook it ourselves? You're going to sell it."</p>
<p>"Hmph! Cook it ourselves? Silly boy, it weighs several pounds, your dad really can't bear to sell it. Our "jiaoguo" of several days (i.e., living expenses) will be enough. Not to mention, Dad can still drink two ounces. Why… why shouldn’t I… shouldn’t I sell it!"</p>
<p>Si Dai of course didn't dare to rebel. Firstly, he was his dad, and secondly, what Dad said also made sense. Although he was a little greedy and wanted to boil the fish to eat, Dad had his own ideas. Not to mention, the fish was speared by Dad, so of course Dad had the right to dispose of it. Besides, he didn't help when Dad was spearing the fish, and secretly hid in the boat to read novels. Dad didn't get angry, and that was already enough face. It would be an excessive request to insist that Dad not sell the fish and eat it himself. What's more, the old man had a wine addiction, and if he didn't sell the fish, where would the money come from to buy wine?</p>
<p>Thinking of this, Si Dai suddenly remembered the face of the female shopkeeper when Dad bought wine on credit at the small shop, which was enough to feed fifteen people for half a month. Thinking it over, he thought that Dad's idea was right. So, later, he didn't say anything, and without waiting for Dad to speak, he started rowing the boat towards his own village!</p>
<p>That was exactly the late spring season, with a dark blue sky covering a green scene. The entire countryside was like being covered with a velvet felt. The reeds along the banks of the two rivers stood upright like silk bamboo. Occasionally, a small gust of wind came, and they swayed aimlessly with the wind, making a rustling sound.</p>
<p>In the lower reaches of the river, near the edges of the banks, emerald green lotus plants floated on the surface. Ducks swam leisurely back and forth in groups on the water, and when they were happy, they also sang "quack, quack." Crows and other small birds flew in the sky from time to time. The willows on both banks swayed in the evening wind, as if forming a welcoming team for the father and son who were driving the boat.</p>
<p>Although the surrounding scenery was so beautiful and lovely, they didn't feel much about it in their eyes, because they were already used to it.</p>
<p>While rowing the boat, Si Dai sang loudly. What he sang was neither Western songs nor skin **, but authentic Bangzi opera Qinqiang. This was the skill he learned in the village opera club, and he had already performed on stage several times. He was a very famous rural amateur actor. Not only could he sing well, but his martial arts skills were also quite impressive, because he played martial arts roles. He had just turned sixteen this year, but he had not yet married. In fact, the old man did not have the idea of having grandchildren early on, but because of poverty, everything was out of the question. To be honest, at that time, the old man was only forty years old, and theoretically, he could remarry. In fact, didn't the old man also have this idea? But once he thought about the problems of the young, whether it was his son getting married or himself remarrying, both were out of the question. Money "held" people like this!</p>
<p>Although the old man often boasted to others that his son was good-looking, with a full forehead and a wide, square face, and that he would definitely be rich and noble in the future, and that when that day came, he would become an old man, he did not object to his son learning opera. Of course, they learned opera in the evenings, which did not hinder the daytime work, which was also the main reason.</p>
<p>Therefore, he didn't say anything when Si Dai sang opera to amuse himself while rowing the boat. Moreover, he was smiling and listening intently, smoking his ** tobacco pipe.</p>
<p>When the boat reached the shore, the sun had not yet touched the mountains. The old man carried the fish in his left hand and took a thread in his right hand and went ashore. After turning the rope around a small tree several times, he tied a knot, and the boat stopped there. The old man went back to his only ancestral property—the small, dilapidated house—and Si Dai took off the paddle, carried it on his shoulder, and followed him off the boat. After putting the paddle in the house, he said to the old man, "Dad, what shall we cook?"</p>
<p>The old man looked at his son, put the fish in front of him, "Si Dai, first sell it in the street, and then cook when you return. I'm not very hungry yet..."</p>
<p>Si Dai didn't say anything, took the fish and went out, but as soon as he got to the threshold, the old man spoke again.</p>
<p>"Si Dai, take my wine bottle with you. After selling the fish, remember to buy four ounces of wine for me. Also, wrap two ounces of broad beans to eat with the wine... Oh, if there are sesame cakes or fried dough sticks for sale, you can buy a few sets to eat yourself. Anyway, I don't want to eat dinner after drinking wine. You can just eat a few sets of sesame cakes and fried dough sticks, so you don't have to cook. You have been working hard these days. Dad should also buy something to reward you... Okay, go."</p>
<p>Si Dai turned around, took the old man's wine pot, nodded, and went to the street.</p>
<p>After his son left, the old man also felt a little tired. He sat on the kang, leaning his back against the mud wall, and smoked his old Guandong leaf tobacco one bag after another. After Si Dai left, things went quite smoothly. Without waiting to shout, the small son of the big landlord bought it for the price of one dollar. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e114">Last Week's Gold Notes Initially Thriving Then Weak, Rice Prices Stagnant, Government Bonds Plunging, Yarn and Cloth Weak <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>Last week, gold notes flourished. Importers eagerly absorbed US dollars, pushing prices steadily upward. However, a decline began toward the weekend, ultimately closing two hundred yuan higher than the previous week. Gold also surged due to the rise in US dollars, climbing sixty to seventy thousand yuan compared to the previous weekend. The two most popular stocks were relatively stable, while the rest varied between flat and weak. Trading in foreign stocks was minimal, with a weak foundation. Given unfavorable redemption circumstances, the overall market trend declined. The rice market showed little improvement, but rice weevils remained secretly active. The following is a report on the market conditions for the week:</p>
<p>Hwa Chi: The week started with gradual improvement, driven by unstable conditions and a strong US dollar. Frequent absorption led the price to rise from 1,860,000 to 1,895,000. On Tuesday, it further soared to 1,960,000. However, due to profit-taking, it fell as low as 1,865,000 by Thursday. On Friday, the US dollar rose again, and prices followed suit, closing at 1,910,000. Saturday saw limited fluctuations, with the final price at 1,900,000. Throughout the week, the Central Bank allocated 1,451 bars, with Thursday's allocation price being the lowest and Wednesday's 1,960,000 being the highest.</p>
<p>Foreign Currency: A large quantity of luxury goods from abroad arrived in Shanghai using US dollars. Settlement led to eager absorption, and holders seized the opportunity to raise prices. The week began at 2,510 yuan, rising to 2,800 yuan by Wednesday. Subsequently, due to strict Central Bank controls on US dollar trading, confidence weakened, and the price retreated to 2,670 yuan. On Thursday, it continued to decline. Although importers later had needs, the market turned stronger. However, by Saturday afternoon, a straight-line decline had commenced.</p>
<p>Government Bonds: Monday was firm. On Tuesday, due to redemption, individual investors became nervous and cut their losses significantly. Additionally, short sellers took the opportunity to act, causing the market to decline. Type C bonds closed at 5,000 yuan the previous day, but opened as low as 5,005 on this day. The final price edged up slightly to 5,250. Types A, B, and E once reached 3,250, and Type D reached 3,030. Monday saw rumors of customs gold redemption, triggering short selling activity, and the market continued to decline sharply. Type C bonds retreated from 5,200 to 4,350, Types A, B, and E to 2,700, and Type D to 2,250. On Thursday, northern merchants took advantage of low prices to absorb and cover their short positions significantly, causing prices to rebound. On Saturday, securities firms sold short, and amidst the selling pressure, trends were mixed. Type C bonds retreated to 4,600, Types A and B to 2,750, Type D to 2,550, and Type E to 2,950.</p>
<p>Chinese Stocks: Monday saw profit-taking, and the market turned weak after being firm. Tuesday saw a rebound due to short covering. Wing On Textile rose to 6,005, Maya to 4,600, Jingfu to 315, Xinguang to 310, Qinxing to 240, and the rest also rose. Wednesday saw frequent profit-taking, and the market slightly retreated. Thursday saw continued profit-taking, and prices gradually declined. However, Wing On Textile uniquely showed strength amidst rumors of new stock issuance, rising from 6,000 yuan to 6,450. The rest saw mixed fortunes. Friday saw long positions in unpopular stocks taking profits, and prices were mostly weak. Popular stocks were flat for Wing On Textile, rebounded for Maya, and slightly declined for Jingfu, etc. Saturday saw Wing On Textile taking the lead, as the imminent listing of new shares invigorated confidence and boosted buying interest. Prices trended upward, once reaching beyond 6,700 yuan, and closing at 6,650. The rest were flat or weak.</p>
<p>Foreign Stocks: The week began with firmness and stability. Long positions frequently absorbed, but the foundation was weak, and trading was lackluster. Wheelock rose to 16,000 on Monday and to 17,500 on Tuesday. From Wednesday onward, it showed weakness, and continued to decline to 15,000 on Saturday. Ewo Silk rose from 11,300 on Tuesday to 12,500. However, it gradually declined and closed at 11,300 on Saturday, the same as Monday's closing price. Union Insurance rose from 10,000 yuan on Tuesday to 11,000. It retreated to 10,300 on Wednesday and Thursday, rebounded to 10,100 on Friday, and retreated to within 10,000 yuan on Saturday, with trading at 9,800. The rest saw mixed fortunes.</p>
<p>Food: Under strict supervision by the authorities, speculative rice dealers found it difficult to operate. However, off-market black market trading occurred, drawing significant attention. Buying and selling in the market saw little change throughout the week. It was difficult to differentiate between different grades. There was a slight fluctuation once on Wednesday. Holders were unwilling to sell at market prices, leading to the disposal of all secondary goods. However, high-quality goods were still available. On the same day, the social bureau posted a notice in the market, earnestly advising legitimate rice merchants to trade according to regulations. On Thursday, the mayor personally visited the rice market, urging compliance with regulations. On Friday, thirty-three rice shops were allocated ten shih of rice each from designated rice merchants at market prices to meet the needs of their retail customers. On Saturday, the trend showed a slight turnaround, but people remained uneasy.</p>
<p>Raw Cotton: In the past week, sales to merchant groups were intermittent, lacking large-scale transactions. Prices hovered between 50,000 and 100,000 yuan. This was because the Shanghai Textile Construction Company increased its output due to seasonal factors. As for popular goods such as 42-count and 32-count double-strand fine yarn, supply was also available at times, and in addition, there was also a significant amount of output from other privately operated yarn factories, so it seemed that there were more chips available on the market. 42-count Blue Phoenix yarn and other similar yarns were previously too high, and 20-count and 16-count yarn were too low, but they are now gradually approaching equilibrium, and there is a possibility that they will become increasingly balanced in the future. The Shanghai Textile Construction Company opened 28 varieties of yarn on Monday, 30 varieties on Wednesday, and 28 varieties on Friday, for a total of 86 varieties.</p>
<p>Cloth Market: Because the Shanghai Textile Construction Company opened up more cloth sales, and in addition, there was a flood of foreign goods, merchant groups and door-to-door vendors had ordinary needs during the week, and there was absolutely no change in the market. The whole scene was calm and stable. There was not much change in various cloths from the previous week. The Shanghai Textile Construction Company opened 30 varieties of cloth on Tuesday and 24 varieties of American-made cloth. On Thursday, they opened 30 varieties of cloth and 11 varieties of Mexican-made cloth. On Saturday, they opened 30 varieties of cloth and 19 varieties of American-Mexican cloth.</p>
<p>Dyed Cloth: During the week, the Shanghai Textile Construction Company remained in a wait-and-see state and did not purchase any dyed cloth. In addition, private yarn factories such as Dachen, Minfeng, Anda, Dasheng, Shenxin No. 2 Factory, Sulun, Jiafeng, Qingfeng, Baofeng, and Xinyu factories made considerable purchases. The market situation was more active than the yarn and cloth sectors. The price of high-grade Metteline cloth delivered to the factories reached 109,000 yuan. As a result, the prices of various dyed cloths rose by about three to four thousand yuan compared to the previous weekend. The prices of American cotton futures and spot goods in overseas New York both rose by more than 30 pounds each, it is said.</p>
<p>Rayon: 120-count Tianqiao rayon was 1,420,000 yuan on Monday, rose 60,000 yuan on Tuesday, and retraced 40,000 yuan on Wednesday. On Thursday, the upward trend was strong again, because the price of goods opened by the China Textile Company was enough to sway the market price, so it rose by 70,000 yuan on Friday and by 40,000 yuan on Saturday. As a result, Saturday's price was 140,000 yuan higher than Monday's. The price of miscellaneous brand 120-count bright rayon also rose by 160,000 to 170,000 yuan, and the price of 75-count Golden Rooster semi-bright rayon also rose by 160,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Filature Silk: The Gaoyun Duyo Trading Company had no appetite for silk at all. The intermediate grades of 75-point and 77-point silk with inspection reports were sold between 2,200,000 yuan and 275,000 yuan. Transactions in silk for end-users were relatively lively. The prices of various grades all increased by 50,000 to 100,000 yuan during the week. The Gaoyun Duyo Trading Company goods were sold for 1,800,000 yuan on Saturday by end-users. The price of the Gaoyun Duyo Trading Company silk was generally around 1,550,000 to 600,000 yuan during the week.</p>
<p>Silk Fabrics: There were quite a few changes last week, not lacking speculator involvement. Maya bed covers were 1,470,000 yuan on Monday, and immediately sold for 600,000 yuan after three days. Prices were down 50,000 yuan on Thursday and continued to be weak with very little sales on Friday. On Saturday, they were again sold for around 600,000 yuan, an overall increase of 120,000 to 30,000 yuan. The early week price of Dachen checkered crepe de Chine was 5,100 to 5,200 yuan. It was purchased by a major buyer on Tuesday and soared upwards. By Wednesday, it had risen more than 10% compared to Monday. Because there was no shortage of high-level selling on Thursday, it collapsed. It was still weak on Friday. On Saturday, the old habits relapsed, and it was still sold at the highest price on Wednesday. The overall increase during the week was around 500 yuan.</p>
<p>Metals: This week, due to the increase in factory prices and the lack of orders from the United States, the market was firmer than last week. Because the Xinghua Dog Brand V door locks did not have a large output, they were not yet on the market. Door locks and drawer locks were quite prosperous because of purchases from merchant groups and because wages were increasing. Galvanized iron pipes with a diameter of one inch or more arrived. Four- and six-point pipes were quite profitable because they were in short supply. The rest of the goods were average and did not have much price movement.</p>

<p>(Hong Kong Dispatch) The matter of prohibiting the export of foreign paper from this city was repeatedly requested by the Foreign Paper Merchants Association to be relaxed based on reasoned arguments. Recently, the authorities have repeatedly convened relevant merchants for discussions and made the following decisions. For printing paper and miscellaneous paper that obtained a transshipment certificate upon import, a limited quantity will be permitted for export. The limit for newsprint is 75%, and the limit for miscellaneous paper is 90%. The Customs will be authorized to handle the matter, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e116">American Agricultural Experts to Arrive in China on a Regular Basis to Assist in Developing Agricultural Products; Silk, Wool, and Tung Oil Will All Be Studied <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>(United Press Washington, 15th) American and Chinese agricultural experts will establish a permanent plan for Chinese agriculture within the next six months, enabling Chinese farmers to obtain greater harvests. This matter was proposed by the National Government, and the American representative, led by Dr. Hugh, Vice-President and Dean of the College of Agriculture at the University of California, is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on July 1st. Another representative is Mr. Booker, a member of the United States Department of Agriculture, who taught at Jinling University for many years. According to Mr. Booker, this plan is valuable and beneficial to both China and the United States. We will assist China in making better use of its natural resources and enable the personnel and funds used to obtain greater returns. The American delegation consists of a total of nine people, with expertise in various agricultural sectors. China will also appoint a delegation to cooperate with the American delegation. All items related to agriculture, from silk to tung oil and the wool used to manufacture carpets, will be studied by Chinese and American experts. A major objective of this plan is to increase harvests and stabilize production. Taking tung oil as an example, the United States needs more high-quality tung oil, supplied in a stable quantity at a stable price, which does not conflict with tung oil production in the United States. After arriving in China, the American delegation will stay in Nanjing and Shanghai for several weeks to become more familiar with the various issues, and then travel across the country, spending two months examining the rural situation in detail. In addition to Hugh and Booker, the delegation includes seven other members: Case, President of the University of Illinois; Feines, engineering consultant at the Huaihua Mining University; Scheutz of the Virginia Polytechnic Institute; Clay, a member of the Department of Agriculture; Nanspeeder, fisheries consultant to the China Branch of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration; and Hermore, an agricultural educator for the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration.</p>

<p>(Reuters Washington, 15th) US Secretary of Agriculture Anderson recently gave a broadcast stating that the US government currently has enough wheat stored to fulfill its aid obligations through the end of June. The problem lies entirely in how to accelerate shipments to various locations. Anderson acknowledged that the obligations have not yet been met, but the grains moved have exceeded any other country. Over the past twelve months, the grains exported accounted for 40% of the world's total, including 9 million tons of wheat. Exports from the 1945 harvest are expected to reach 10 million tons.</p>
<h3 id="e120">US Gasoline Controls to be Lifted; Inventories Hoarded <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters New Haven 15th] Inquiries regarding gasoline are pouring in from domestic and foreign sources, causing the price of gasoline to be firm and profitable. In addition, no one is selling off inventories, effectively bringing trade to a standstill. A few sales at high prices are the exception. The reasons for this eager demand are: (1) Oil transportation personnel may strike, and (2) Oil sources already show signs of contraction, leading to this situation. Refiners also see that the controls on petroleum products will be lifted at the end of June, so they are extremely unwilling to release large amounts of stored oil. Currently, the domestic and foreign demand for kerosene and light fuel is still quite urgent, and the demand in the winter of this year is expected to be enormous, so everyone hopes that the depleted inventories can be replenished in advance. In addition, because holders are firmly unwilling to sell, even if a few heavy fuels can be obtained, they are extremely small.</p>
<h3 id="e121">Speaking from the Crisis of National Industry at the Current Stage to the Inevitability of China's Industrial Development in the Future by Zhang Boan <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>A highly developed national industry does not depend on simple conditions, but on the cooperation of many conditions. The most important of these is "personnel." Everything has to be done by people. If personnel are not in place, everything is hopeless.</p>
<p>The crisis of China's industry did not begin today. After July 7th, Chinese industry in general enjoyed wartime prosperity. Its development can be said to be very rapid, but it can also be said that because it was a "wartime" prosperity, it developed very quickly and collapsed very quickly.</p>
<p>As early as the spring of the 33rd year of the Republic [1944], the Chongqing Relocated Factories Federation pointed out the crisis of Chinese industry. At the same time, Minister Weng also devised various methods to remedy it. However, the development of industry is gradual. During development, no pressure can be used to impede it. Conversely, when it collapses, it naturally deteriorates, and no remedial methods can help.</p>
<p>Before the war, it could not be said that China's national industry was "in embryonic form." During the war, there were no industrial conditions to support it in the remote mountains. How could industry be established? After the war, the original industrial property in the coastal industrial areas was recovered as a whole. However, because "personnel" were not in place, not only was this property snatched back from the bloodbath not properly taken over, but also the production network was dismantled! This is not surprising, because after the sudden victory, all the steps were chaotic, and industrial production was also in an atmosphere of "chaos."</p>
<p>As for recently, national industry has entered a state of collapse from a crisis-ridden situation. Who caused this, and what led to it? This question is worth studying.</p>
<p>Recently, more than 20 factories in Shanghai have closed their doors, and many other factories are on the road to layoffs and salary reductions. The reason is that wages and raw material costs are high, while the value of finished products is low. Factories cannot survive and can only go to their deaths. But this is not alarming, because the current national industry seems to be infected with an epidemic disease. The young and the unhealthy will naturally die first, but the old and the healthy will also inevitably die. In fact, the current national industry is branded with a death warrant. Small-scale industries are interrupted because they cannot compete, while large-scale industries either eke out a living or directly engage in speculation. Production is not as good as speculation, and without speculation, they cannot survive. This is an abnormal phenomenon in industrial management. Secondly, many industries can actually compete with foreign goods and make high profits, but they also feel headache due to the epidemic disease. The reason is still wages and raw material costs, which are increasing daily. Industrialists only know how to continue the wartime profiteering mentality. When "wages" increase, they have an excuse to add on the prices, once, twice, repeatedly. What about the cost calculation book of the industrialists? For example, if the manufacturing cost of a certain product, according to the wartime profiteering calculation, is 10,000 yuan, plus a profit of 10,000 yuan, it is not "black-hearted." Assuming that the wage cost in this 10,000 yuan is 2,000, if it is to be increased to 3,000, the industrialist will turn it into 6,000, this is the wartime profiteering, which has afflicted the industry and poisoned the "workers"! Industrialists seem to be gambling, not engaging in industry. Make money today and squander it today, and then close the door tomorrow.</p>
<p>There are also many factories that are affected by the times, and everything is bureaucratized. From the manager to the small employees, everyone is thinking about their own pockets. Engaging in industry is like becoming an official. Since they are officials, all speculation and profiteering are unavoidable!</p>
<p>Based on this, the Chinese industries that can "survive" and can compete are simply the minority of the minority. However, the current industrial crisis is only temporary and cannot become the argument that Chinese industry will never succeed. However, based on the current actions of China's national industry, it can be said that most of them will close their doors. The more ambitious will still be able to "survive" and be able to "compete." "Things must rot first, and then insects will grow." Survival of the fittest. How can those who engage in industry escape the laws of nature? The current collapse of industry is a symbol of future recovery!</p>
<p>Then, will our national industry develop? To answer this question, I can say, "Why did China fight Japan to the end?" Fighting to the end is the fundamental desire of the entire people to survive. Is "China's industrialization" not also the fundamental desire of the entire people to survive? The current collapse of national industry can be summed up in one sentence: "the problem of people."</p>
<p>Originally, in terms of China's industrial conditions, it can be said that it is superior to others in every aspect. Is the intelligence of the Chinese people inferior to others? Just look at the wartime industries, all of which performed very brilliantly. Everything that was missing was found a way to replace it. At that time, the industrial conditions were far inferior to the present. We often have to strive. Now that all conditions are much better than before, how can we not strive? As for the strong enemies of foreign goods and the lack of industrial capital, these are not fundamental problems. The things manufactured by foreigners from far away are dumped in China. Can't we really "wait for work to be done"? And how can there be so much market wandering capital when there is a lack of industrial capital? These are all enough for us to think deeply and reflect—</p>

<p>[Reuters, New Arlen, 15th] Inquiries about gasoline from home and abroad have been pouring in, and gasoline prices have rebounded firmly. Moreover, no one is selling their inventories, and transactions have virtually come to a standstill. Only a few transactions have been completed at high prices, which are exceptional cases. The reasons for this urgent demand are: (1) Transportation workers may go on strike. (2) There are signs that oil sources are tightening. Furthermore, oil refiners, anticipating the lifting of controls on petroleum products at the end of June, are extremely reluctant to release large quantities of oil in storage. Currently, the demand for kerosene and light fuel oil both at home and abroad remains quite pressing, and it is anticipated that demand will be enormous this winter. Everyone hopes that depleted inventories can be replenished beforehand. Moreover, due to holders' unwillingness to sell heavy fuel oil, even if one or two transactions can be secured, the quantities are extremely small.</p>

<h3 id="e123">The New American Auto King After the War <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>— Translated by Ding Ze</p>
<p>In the American automobile manufacturing industry, Ford, General Motors, and Chrysler have always been known as the Big Three. Starting this February, the emerging Kaiser-Frazer (Kaiser Frazer) automobile factory (hereinafter referred to as Kaiser-Frazer) joined the competition. Therefore, people in Detroit, the heart of American auto manufacturing, are watching this new factory with the same eyes as they observed Chrysler's rise and struggle in 1924.</p>
<p>The two owners of Kaiser-Frazer are already famous in the United States. Henry J. Kaiser is a well-known steel and heavy industry manufacturing giant. During the war, he handled almost all steel, metal, and machinery except for automobiles. Joseph W. Frazer has always been renowned in the automotive industry.</p>
<p>Kaiser-Frazer's new cars come in two models, each named after its owner, Frazer and Kaiser. The former is priced between $1,200 and $1,500, and its features include: 1. A new style body, 2. A wide front window, 3. A spacious body and seats, 4. A regular engine with 100 horsepower. The latter is priced at approximately $1,000, with a body similar to the former but using front-wheel drive. It weighs 500 pounds less than the Frazer and has slightly less horsepower. The Frazer car is intended to compete with mid-priced cars like Oldsmobile, Buick, Dodge, and Mercury. The Kaiser car is intended to compete with low-priced cars like Ford, Chevrolet, Chrysler, and Studebaker.</p>
<p>Kaiser-Frazer plans to manufacture in large quantities, projecting that each model will produce 750 cars per day this summer, with an annual output of approximately 300,000 cars.</p>
<p>Kaiser-Frazer currently has capital of over $20 million, as well as the machinery from the merged Graham-Paige automobile factory and the ability to manufacture new machines. Compared to the existing Big Three, Ford, General Motors, and Chrysler, which have a combined capital of $3.5 billion, the difference is vast.</p>
<p>The main tools used in automobile manufacturing are very valuable. For example, the full set of molds for pressing the steel shell of the car body costs $3 million. A complete set of machines for pressing car body doors and roofs costs $615,000. Therefore, given Kaiser-Frazer's current capital, people in New York and Detroit do not hold much hope for its success. Most of the criticisms are unfavorable. Some say that Frazer has never manufactured cars, and he is only good at selling them. Others say that Kaiser only knows how to build ships and is a layman when it comes to automobiles. Some say that Frazer might hire a group of engineers to manufacture cars for him, but it is unknown who would be willing to sell them. Still others say that this car factory may only be a speculative stock venture, which may endanger Kaiser's reputation, and so on. These types of criticisms inevitably contain some jealousy, but the establishment of this new car factory will undoubtedly accelerate the trend from conservatism to the adoption of modern new inventions.</p>
<p>Kaiser-Frazer has leased a large aircraft factory building in Willow Run for a term of five years. The factory will manufacture its own bodies, engines, and front-wheel drive components, while other components will be purchased as ready-made standard parts from the market.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, the factory building in Willow Run is being refitted with automobile machinery. Ford has moved everything out. The government's aircraft manufacturing equipment has also been moved to war surplus storage. Kaiser-Frazer has already ordered automobile tools and is in the process of installing them. Large quantities of steel materials are also arriving continuously, and advertisements have been drafted and are awaiting publication. Steel tycoon Kaiser is traveling east from the West Coast to inspect the factory. Dealerships across the country are preparing for the unveiling ceremony of the new cars. And Frazer, who is actually driving this new organization, is busy receiving guests in his huge office.</p>
<p>People close to Kaiser and Frazer do not deny that they will encounter a fierce automobile competition. However, they unanimously believe that there are four major advantages: 1. The advantages of the new car, 2. The large number of people eager to buy cars after the war, 3. The public's admiration for Kaiser's contributions during the war, 4. Frazer's past business successes.</p>
<p>Frazer's struggle in the automobile industry has been going on for a long time, and this is his third time investing in it. When Chrysler acquired the Maxwell automobile factory in 1924 with a capital of $4 million, Frazer was appointed as the sales manager of Chrysler, and later promoted to general manager and vice president. When Frazer left Chrysler in 1939, the factory had grown into one of the Big Three American automakers, with an annual turnover of $55 million. When Frazer joined Willys-Overland as general manager, it was at the company's lowest point, with an annual turnover of only $9 million and a total of 1,100 employees. By the time Frazer left Willys in 1943, the total number of employees had increased to 14,000, and the annual turnover had reached $170 million (this number increased to $212 million in 1944). Willys's development was partly due to Frazer's talent and partly due to the war. Willys became famous for building jeeps during the war, and although Frazer did not invent the jeep, his efforts to promote it nationwide were not insignificant.</p>
<p>Frazer's situation has always been good. Since joining Chrysler, he has consistently enjoyed a large salary. The new factory has set his annual salary at $82,500. His residence is comparable to that of other wealthy people. His hobbies are also the same as those of wealthy American businessmen. He has a large ranch in Arizona and a large farm in Olympia. In addition, he serves as a director of the Paramount Hotel in New York and is not interested in businesses other than automobiles.</p>
<p>Frazer's maternal lineage comes from the uncle of President Washington. Frazer received education from Yale University, and soon found work as a machinist's assistant with wages of only sixteen cents per hour. He then entered the Packard automobile factory school as a teacher, and soon after the Packard factory's New York dealership was established, Frazer began his career in automobile sales. Since 1914, Frazer has been involved in investing in automobiles, promoting automobiles, and promoting the automobile industry. He then transferred from the Packard factory to the export department of General Motors, then to the Pierce Arrow factory, and then to the Chrysler factory, where he made a big splash. After developing the factory for fifteen years, he took a group of capable engineers to the Willys-Overland factory. Frazer's usual motto is 'Conservatism is an illusion, and rest is not the purpose of life.' These two sentences can explain why Frazer left Chrysler at its peak and instead invested in the declining Willys-Overland factory. When Frazer was at Willys, there were many thorny problems to be solved. One week, there was even no money to pay wages, and he had to personally sell eighty-five cars to cope.</p>
<p>Frazer had already planned to manufacture his own cars when he was at Willys, but his proposal was not accepted by the chairman of Willys, so he resigned in 1943. This was the first time Frazer had left the automobile industry in thirty years. But ahead, there were two great opportunities: one was that the war could end, and the other was that the suspension of civilian car production during the war could resume. When these opportunities arrived, automobile manufacturers, whether new or old, could sell without advertising. Those who can manufacture good cars will find it easier to sell them. There is no need for the small market of the past, where they had to compete fiercely and spend huge sums on advertising. Frazer knew all these favorable points very well. However, after leaving the automobile industry, he had to raise a large amount of capital, find a large factory base, and design a car to organize.</p>
<p>In 1944, Frazer was invited by Warren Heavy Machinery to solve the difficulties it encountered. At that time, Warren Factory accepted a naval order for landing craft, but found difficulties in manufacturing. At this time, Frazer readily accepted the invitation, as he had a plan in mind to use this as an opportunity to devote himself to manufacturing cars. Later, he was able to realize his plan.</p>
<p>Frazer, based on the statutory minimum capital of $500 in Olympia, organized Warren Boiler Factory. He also borrowed a huge amount of money from the government to purchase machinery. With the planning of Frazer's outstanding engineers, the manufacturing difficulties were soon resolved. The government loan was gradually repaid. After six months, Graham-Paige automobile factory, because of the huge profits made from manufacturing automobiles, Graham, the major shareholder of the factory, seeing that the factory's future was not optimistic, because it had no significant reputation before the war and no fresh plans after the war, wanted to take this opportunity to sell his shares. Frazer immediately bought 530,000 shares with his comrades. At that time, Graham-Paige factory exchanged 150,000 shares for 500 shares of Warren factory. At this time, Frazer jumped to become the chairman of Graham-Paige automobile factory. The capital of Warren factory, which was initially formed with $500, suddenly became worth $300,000. Later, Frazer's new plan for automobiles after the war caused a sensation in the stock market, and the value of its shares increased sixfold, so its assets increased from $300,000 to $1.8 million. At this time, Frazer was smooth sailing, firmly in control of automobile manufacturing, and became the envy of Wall Street.</p>
<p>After Frazer became the chairman of Graham-Paige, he immediately reorganized and appointed a large number of engineers to improve ordinary gasoline engines. He also hired Howard Darrin, a famous car body designer, to specialize in designing fashionable car bodies. Darrin was known for his favor among Hollywood actresses and European elites.</p>
<p>In the spring of 1945, Germany surrendered. Kaiser, in order to expand his existing factory operations, constantly worked to seek cooperation with large capitalists. His efforts were comparable to Frazer's efforts to promote Packard cars to the Russian prince in 1913. Frazer traveled to Washington, D.C., New York, and other places, but only received advice and no investors. He then visited major aircraft factories in California, persuading them to transform into automobiles after the war, but no one responded. Finally, he met Giannini of the Bank of America, and encountered a stroke of luck. With Giannini's help, he met steel tycoon Kaiser the next day.</p>
<p>The two hit it off at first sight. In just two days, the plan for Kaiser-Frazer was laid down. The two had never met before, and Kaiser did not meet him when he was in the eastern United States last spring. Kaiser had always been interested in manufacturing automobiles. His motives were threefold: one was that the automobile industry was a big business. The second was to attract the automobile industry to the West Coast of the United States (because his steel business was all there). The third was to promote the sale of his steel and manganese products that had expanded during the war after the war. In 1942, Kaiser had a written argument with Frazer in the newspapers, disputing the automobile business. Frazer mocked him for talking about automobiles as a shipbuilder, which would inevitably make him a laughing stock in the industry.</p>
<p>Kaiser has actually manufactured cars in the past four years, having built eleven types. He is currently using a plaster car. This unique car is one of the eleven types mentioned above. Kaiser is confident that he can manufacture all parts in the western United States, but the car body is quite a problem. He went to Detroit to lobby, but the car body factories were very cold to him. Kaiser was frustrated and returned defeated. He originally planned to change his plan and manufacture small cars, but he soon met Frazer.</p>
<p>Today, Kaiser and Frazer are a perfect match after joining forces. Because of Kaiser's connections, he was able to lease the factory in Willow Run. The registration procedures for the new company originally required ten days, but after Kaiser personally negotiated with the government authorities, he said that he could build a ship for the government in as short as five days, so the government should also speed up the registration for him. Five days later, the registration was completed. Therefore, investors flocked to invest during the fundraising, and soon the number of shares subscribed exceeded the regulations by six and a half times. Today, letters from all over the United States are flying to Willow Run, with no less than 9,000 people contacting to distribute the cars, among which some are willing to abandon their old contracts to exclusively sell the new brand of cars. In their enthusiasm, one letter to Kaiser said that Kaiser's transport ship had carried home his son who was on an expedition, so he was determined to wait to buy a car made by Kaiser. Others praised Kaiser for his great success in shipbuilding and said that he would also succeed in building automobiles.</p>
<h3 id="e124">Introduction to Business Administration <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Baiyi</p>
<p>For example, if our manufacturing requires a considerable amount of labor, and we set up our factory near residential areas, then in the future, workers will have to come from afar, causing many inconveniences. The Yangshupu area in Shanghai has always been known as the factory area, and many workers live there. A manufacturing factory opened in the factory area will not have any difficulties in recruiting labor.</p>
<p>But on the one hand, of course, it also depends on the nature of the manufacturing factory. If it is a pharmaceutical factory, then it may as well choose a quiet place with good air and environment, which is more suitable for the manufacturing factory.</p>
<p>After a manufacturing factory is established, the workers will have long-term work, and they will also find houses near the factory to live in, making it more convenient to travel back and forth every day, but in any case, this is a problem worth considering, and it can become a rather important component in determining the location of the manufacturing factory.</p>
<p>(3) Assembly of various objects: There are several types of manufacturing factories that need to assemble various objects. The automobile manufacturing factory is one example. An automobile manufacturing factory does not manufacture its own tires. Even the car body is sometimes not made by itself. In this case, then when choosing the location of the factory, it can only seek the greatness of the factory building, so that the work can proceed smoothly. If it can be located in a suitable central location, and is very close to the sources of various necessary objects, that is the most ideal.</p>
<p>(4) Transportation issues: The transportation issue of a manufacturing factory is very important, especially when the products of a manufacturing factory sell well throughout the country. It must rely on convenient transportation to enable the goods to reach various provinces and cities quickly. Then, being close to transportation institutions such as railway stations and docks can save transportation costs on the one hand, and save transportation time on the other hand.</p>
<p>Therefore, when we want to establish a new manufacturing factory, the above points should be considered, but in fact, sometimes it may not be possible to solve the problems in all aspects perfectly. Then, we can only weigh the pros and cons and deal with them accordingly.</p>

<p>— Sent by Mei Jian</p>
<p>Tianjin, 8th (Air Mail Report)</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, the reporter, along with Section Chief Chen of the Social Affairs Bureau, made a special trip to No. 47 Yangjia Garden to investigate the details of the sealing of the Neng Hua Society. Not far from the main street in front of the Sino-Western Women's School, a majestic mansion can be seen from afar. Entering the gate, which is like that of a prince's residence, is an outer courtyard lined with flowers and trees. Led by the guarding police, we entered a row of five large halls facing south, where many people with long hair and left-fastened robes were sitting and lying uneasily, their brows furrowed, reminiscing about their dreams of being emperors.</p>
<p>Asking the "Father-in-Law" to Show the Newspaper</p>
<p>After settling down, the guard, Section Chief Chen, reported that the escaped Vice President Tao Xiang had surrendered himself at around 4:00 AM on the 7th and was now resting in the inner room. After we sent people to invite him three times, this self-proclaimed "Father-in-Law," the deputy leader, finally emerged slowly. Section Chief Chen first took out a copy of the Yishi Daily from his pocket and had the vice president sit down and read it carefully, intending to make this strange man, who was isolated from the world, understand the reasons for the Social Affairs Department and the Tianjin Municipal Authorities' sealing of the society, as well as the lenient handling policies of the responsible authorities in the future.</p>
<p>This vice president reluctantly calmed himself and finished reading, then held his head in his hands, showing a distressed face, furrowing his brows and closing his eyes, trying to squeeze out a few tears to win sympathy. However, his emotions and tears were not under artificial control, so he couldn't shed any.</p>
<p>Speaking Despondently, the Phone Call is Bizarre</p>
<p>He said dejectedly: "I am already 62 years old. Last year, I was arrested by the Japanese Kempeitai in Harbin, who knocked out my teeth and beat my ears. I never thought that now..." According to him: On the morning of the 6th, he took a plane to Beiping, preparing to go to Shanghai. He was resting at the Liangshi Store and Shengguan Restaurant outside Qianmen in Beiping when he received a call from Tianjin saying that something had happened at the Dajin Society, so he rushed back that night. As for who made the call, he said it wasn't someone from the society, but probably a friend nearby. He refused to reveal who this friend was. Only he himself knows whether he went to Beiping or was hiding in Tianjin.</p>
<p>The "Emperor" Has Gone Far Away, His Fate Unknown</p>
<p>The reporter asked, "Where is Ma Yingshi (i.e., 'Emperor Ma')?" He said, "The old man left in the 24th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1935]. The two brothers who went with him returned and said that the old man went to Mount Luoqi in the South Sea." "Have there been any messages since then?" the reporter asked. He continued, "No, it's hard to say whether he is still alive or has ascended to heaven." The reporter asked, "What about the two brothers who came back?" He said, "The two brothers both died not long after returning."</p>
<p>The Eight Great "Courtiers" Wailed Loudly</p>
<p>If you want to find out the whereabouts of "Emperor Ma" from their mouths, it cannot be obtained by interviewing. At this time, the eight responsible persons (the so-called Eight Great Courtiers) gathered in the hall, when they heard that "the old man had already ascended to heaven," began to wail and cry as if they had lost their parents. The guards repeatedly stopped them. They thought that "crying" would win everyone's sympathy, and they took the opportunity to boast about their achievements in running charitable causes and protecting underground workers.</p>
<p>Answering Reporters' Questions, Many Different Opinions</p>
<p>When the reporter asked them, "What work did you do during the period of the enemy puppet regime? Why are there no account books?" They stammered and said, "The past is in the past, and we don't remember clearly." "There were account books originally, but because we heard that the authorities were going to ban us, we hid both prohibited and non-prohibited items." "Outsiders all say that Master Ma is Emperor Ma, with an army, feudal courtiers, concubines, and revised calendar..." "That's not true. I don't know who we offended. They are just spreading rumors. The so-called revision of the calendar, changing one year to eighteen months and each month to forty-eight days, this was not created by us. Some books say so. If that kind of calendar is used, the world will be at peace, so we believe in it. We didn't create it ourselves, you know?"</p>
<p>Founded for a Long Time, 35 Years</p>
<p>The reporter asked them why they keep long queues, they said: "Having hair is having the law." The reporter did not understand what they meant by "law." Was it magic? Regulations? They refused to explain it clearly.</p>
<p>They continued: "This society was founded in the year of Xinhai [1911] and has been around for thirty-five years. We were investigated and sealed in Shandong. Later, we moved to Beijing. The Master was assassinated in Jinan. The Master Ma was saddened and angered, so he disappeared." They stated repeatedly that their position was purely charitable. When they weren't careful, they would unconsciously reveal some clues that they were colluding with ambitious warlords and instigating chaos.</p>
<p>Two "Princesses" Cultivating in the Inner Room</p>
<p>In order to express that there were no secrets in their inner courtyard, they hoped to guide the reporter to see each department. The reporter followed them up and down the building for a quick look. Of course, it would not be easy to discover any secrets. One hundred and sixty-two male members were arranged in each room, sitting leisurely, waiting for fate to arrange their destiny. Forty-five of the one hundred and forty-five female members had already reported the locking of their household registrations and returned to their hometowns. The remaining ones were only elderly and weak rural women and girls. There were a few women in their thirties, but they didn't look as beautiful as the rumors said. However, looking at the household registration records, except for one-tenth being old women and young girls, most were young women in their twenties and thirties, but they were not seen. However, the two princesses, who were respected outside, had not left. One was named Ma Haocheng, 29 years old, and the other was named Ma Shanxing, 30 years old. It is said that they were dressed in Taoist robes and hats, and because they felt uncomfortable, they were resting in the inner room. The reporter did not dare to disturb them and failed to see the style of the princesses. The furnishings of the female members' room, the furniture for sitting and sleeping, were all antique and gorgeous. Being in it, it was difficult to feel that it was a place for quiet cultivation. Even the mansions of wealthy merchants and old men were not as good.</p>
<p>The Garden Has Many Exotic Flowers and the Buddha Hall is Deeply Closed</p>
<p>Leaving the inner courtyard, entering the garden pavilion, strange flowers and precious trees, quiet and secluded, although it has been in disrepair for many years, it cannot conceal its luxurious nature. The space between the guest hall and the inner house is the Buddha hall. Because it has been sealed by the Tianjin Police Bureau, it is impossible to see the whole picture. Looking through the glass windows, only incense tables and offerings can be seen. In the middle is a cinnabar Buddha character. It is said that the society does not worship idols, but only regards the Wuji Old Mother as the invisible master.</p>
<p>After visiting the headquarters, we went to the "Poor People's Clinic" attached to the society. The clinic is a three-entrance courtyard. The front yard is the hospital. A Western doctor has returned to his original residence in Datong. A Chinese medicine doctor, Mr. Wang, also appeared in front of us in the same attire. The middle courtyard is the dormitory for female members. Most of them are concentrated in the headquarters, leaving only a blind and deaf old woman to guard it.</p>
<p>The backyard is the kitchen. Underneath the kitchen, there is a cellar, which is already filled with furnace ash. It is not yet known whether there are any secrets underneath. One place is a school that has been suspended. One place is a dormitory for female members, but they have all been concentrated at the headquarters, so there is no need to visit it, so we gave up.</p>
<p>Writing about all these details are all impressions gained by the reporter. Because the society had concealed everything in advance, it was difficult to obtain the confirmation of what was rumored outside. The words of the parties involved were incoherent, making it even more difficult to discover anything from the conversation. The matter itself is a mystery, and the unveiling of the mystery cannot be done in a short time. What the truth is remains to be seen through the authorities' multi-faceted searches and the parties' frank confessions.</p>
<h3 id="e126">The Two Main Culprits of the Dragon Flower Society: "Emperor" Ma and "Father-in-Law" Tao <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>Since the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-95, the Japanese militarists, who were dreaming of invading China, in order to achieve their illusion of a continental policy, in addition to carrying out various aggressive offensives on the front, also secretly supported those warlords and bandits who had no national concept, creating many seeds that could promote internal strife in our country. After the July 7th Incident, they intensified their efforts to create various puppet organizations in the occupied areas, using various secret societies, spreading heresies, in order to eliminate the patriotic feelings of our compatriots and corrupt the social order of our country.</p>
<p>Uneasily Publishing Announcements to Refute Rumors</p>
<p>Before the 6th, the One Heart Heavenly Way Dragon Flower Holy Church had repeatedly published announcements in various newspapers to refute rumors, and stated that the society's position was upright and fair. We felt that something was suspicious. Why would everyone spread rumors about a religious group? As a result, the truth was revealed. The so-called One Heart Heavenly Way Dragon Flower Holy Church was originally a secret organization of heresy and ghost ways manufactured by the enemy, as mentioned earlier.</p>
<p>Far-Reaching and Powerful Criminals Slipping Through the Net</p>
<p>At about 10:00 AM on the 6th, the Police Bureau, upon the order of the Municipal Government, specially dispatched the captain of the Criminal Brigade, the chief of the Administrative Section, and the chief of the 7th Branch Bureau, Jia Hanshen, and others, leading more than 30 armed police officers, to the One Heart Heavenly Way Dragon Flower Holy Church at No. 47 Yangjia Garden to carry out the ban. They arrived at the society at 11:00 AM and immediately launched a search. The head of the society, Ma Guanying, and the deputy head, Tao Yunxiang, as well as 45 young and beautiful female members, had already fled after hearing the news. The remaining 130 male members were there doing their daily routine of cultivation. After the case officers explained their intentions, these villagers, who were being deceived, immediately lost their senses and were sent into the legal net by the Dragon Flower Holy Mother.</p>
<p>The Results of the Search are Being Sorted Out</p>
<p>The Social Affairs Bureau also sent personnel to the scene upon hearing the news and assisted the police bureau's investigation personnel in inspecting everything inside the society. As a result, the evidence that the society colluded with the Japanese enemy to establish the "Greater East Asia Buddhist Federation," hung Japanese flags, and revised the calendar was discovered by the inspection personnel. At that time, the personnel of the Social Affairs Bureau stated that these members were all kind and good people, who had been incited by heresy and ghost ways, resulting in the loss of their family fortunes to join the society. From a human perspective, this is very pitiful. Regarding the illegal parts of the society, in addition to the police bureau continuing to investigate the whereabouts of the head of the society, Ma Guanying, the Social Affairs Bureau decided to give appropriate treatment to the 130 members of the society, in order to eliminate their future pain.</p>
<p>Regarding the motive of the authorities' ban on the One Heart Heavenly Way Dragon Flower Holy Church this time, it is said that as early as six months ago, when Mayor Zhang first took office, many people reported to the Municipal Government, exposing the crimes of the society. At that time, Mayor Zhang believed that since the society was a religious group and had more than 100,000 members, it was not appropriate to act rashly. In addition to sending personnel to investigate the truth of the society, he also sent letters to various provinces and cities to inquire about the society's activities there. At the same time, he personally went to the society to investigate with Deputy Mayor Du, Director Hu of the Social Affairs Bureau, Director Li of the Police Bureau, and others. As a result, many suspicious places were discovered. A few days ago, the Party and government organs of Shanxi, Shandong, and other provinces and cities also separately replied to the Tianjin Municipal Government, proving that the society was purely a heresy. The Ministry of Social Affairs also sent a letter to Tianjin a few days ago, stating that the society's movements were secretive and suspicious, and hoped that the Tianjin Municipal Government would ban it nearby. Therefore, the Municipal Government issued a ban order yesterday morning, ordering the Police Bureau to immediately stop the society's activities.</p>
<p>Self-Proclaimed Emperor, Enfeoffing Ministers, and Accepting Concubines</p>
<p>According to reports, the One Heart Heavenly Way Dragon Flower Holy Church originated in Dingwang Village, Changshan, Shandong. The founder, Ma Shiwei, whose courtesy name was Guanying, was a local ruffian who was restless. Later, he fantasized about becoming an emperor and established the One Heart Hall, using unorthodox methods to lure the villagers, resulting in many who were bewitched by him. When joining the society, one must first donate all their family property to the society, so it is also known as the Qinjia Society (Bankrupt Family Society) or Jingdi Society (Clean Land Society), just like the style of the White Lotus Sect. The Shandong Provincial Government once ordered it to be banned. Ma fled to Dalian, colluding with the Japanese enemy to revive his career. In the 23rd year of the Republic [1934], relying on the cover of the Japanese, he secretly came to Tianjin and found a place in Taoshan Street in the Japanese Concession to set up a society. From then on, it was officially named the One Heart Heavenly Way Dragon Flower Holy Church, obtained a permit from the Japanese Consulate General, and openly carried out activities in the Japanese Concession, spreading heresies, widely recruiting students, calling himself Emperor Ma, enfeoffing ministers, accepting concubines, and arbitrarily revising the calendar, stipulating that one month should have 48 days and one year should have 18 months. The members all kept long hair and beards, wore tall hats and left-fastened robes. At that time, the members of the society often marched in teams, flaunting themselves through the streets, doing everything possible to be strange and unusual. After the July 7th Incident, Tianjin fell, and the society took advantage of the situation to move to No. 47 Yangjia Garden and became very active. In order to repay the Japanese for their support and kindness, the "Greater East Asia Buddhist Federation" was specially established to advocate for the Japanese militarism, painting a bloody and dirty stain on the religious history of our country.</p>
<p>Widely Recruiting Members and Organizing Tightly</p>
<p>The society's address is wide and beautifully decorated. The magnificent situation is like a palace. All the people in the society are members, and outsiders are generally not allowed to mix in.

<p>Some diplomatic figures have recently criticized Secretary of State Byrnes's misinterpretation after the Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference, which led to a series of events that eventually caused the US-Soviet negotiations on the Korean issue to break down. There were many factors that caused the breakdown of the meeting, and the Soviet Union's insistence that certain Korean political parties should not be allowed to join the Korean interim government was one of them.</p>
<p>Observers emphasize that we cannot attribute all the blame to the United States or the Soviet Union. There are many major factors of misunderstanding and many conflicts between the United States' principle of freedom of expression and the Soviet Union's political realism. Many misunderstandings still stem from Byrnes's statement, which first hinted that Korean trusteeship might be avoided. At that time, Lieutenant General Hodge, commander of the US military in Korea, used this statement to deal with the Korean people's opposition to the three-power trusteeship resolution. The result of this move fueled Soviet suspicion that the United States intended to revise the Moscow Conference resolution. Recently, the Soviet Union declared that the negotiations on the Korean issue had failed, indicating that this incident was the main concern of the Soviet side, but the various events that occurred afterwards can explain the current difficulties. In December 1943, the late President Roosevelt, former British Prime Minister Churchill, and Chairman Chiang Kai-shek promised at the Cairo Conference to restore Korea's independence when the time was ripe. The United States was then considering the duration of the trusteeship. The original series of errors started from the misunderstanding of the phrase "when the time is ripe." Koreans translated "when the time is ripe" as "immediately." At the Yalta Conference in February 1945, President Roosevelt first publicly announced the Korean issue to Marshal Stalin, who agreed to the trusteeship plan proposed by the United States. The third event occurred at the Potsdam Conference in July 1945, when President Truman obtained Marshal Stalin's second expression of agreement to the trusteeship plan proposed by the United States. Throughout that period, the Soviet Union showed very little interest in this issue, giving the United States the impression that the Soviet Union really did not want the Korean trusteeship system. When Byrnes went to Moscow, he and his experts expected that a bitter struggle would occur if they wanted to get the Soviet Union to agree to sign this plan, but the Soviet Union immediately agreed, but insisted on changing the trusteeship period to "five years" instead of the ten years in the American plan.</p>
<p>Three days after the Moscow Conference, Byrnes gave a broadcast speech, hinting that trusteeship might be avoided. The Soviet Union believes that Byrnes's statement and General Hodge's use of this statement were an expression of the United States' attempt to abandon the trusteeship resolution at the Moscow Conference. The United States spent two years trying to get the Soviet Union to agree to the trusteeship plan. This attitude of the United States is not easy for the Soviet Union to understand. Now that this plan has been signed by both parties, the United States seems to be talking about the possibility of not implementing it. On the other hand, the Soviet Union immediately targeted the anti-trusteeship movement and demanded that parties in Korea that opposed the Moscow Conference resolution should not join the Korean interim government. The United States opposed this demand from the Soviet Union, saying that this demand violated the freedom of expression and "clearing official discipline." The US-Soviet Commission held talks in Seoul for several weeks without any results, and the conclusion of the breakdown lies in this point. US Deputy Secretary of State Acheson emphasized that the United States is deeply willing to reopen negotiations and implement the Moscow Conference resolution, but only after the Soviet Union recognizes the freedom of all Korean people to express their opinions.

<h3 id="e129">A Country Bumpkin Cries Injustice <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>Editor: I am a reader of your newspaper, only for a few days. Of course, there are very few opportunities to read newspapers in my hometown. I am very fortunate to see your newspaper now. Your newspaper's comments are fair and can speak for the people very well. That's why I picked up my pen to write out the facts of what has been like hell for my hometown in the past few years, to cry out for the wronged dead and to accuse the Japanese who slowly killed young men and women and the bandits who held guns and coerced good people. My hometown is located in Huangjueqiao Town, a small town thirty miles north of Yangzhou. Because of the dense population and many villages, it is incomparable to other towns. Although the land is fertile, the old crops are not connected to the new, which is a phenomenon that occurs every year. Since the rise of the military, my hometown, for the sake of self-defense, organized the Big Knife Society, which was somewhat superstitious, but it was envied by the Japanese, who thought it was a planned organization. One morning, just as it was getting light, hundreds of brutal Japanese descended on my town. They robbed all the big knives from our Big Knife Society, and killed more than 200 people in a one-mile radius. In Zhao Jialin Village alone, more than 40 young men and women were brutally killed. At that time, the scene in my hometown was tragic. There was a pile of corpses in the east and a pile of corpses in the west. Every night, the sound of crying for one's children echoed throughout the countryside. Writing this, my heart is truly sore and I want to cry. From then on, the Big Knife Society was silent. Then, Wang Changji, Zhao Xietou, Guo Shuiquan, Lao Miao, and other leaders led 30 to 40 plainclothes teams to my town, claiming to maintain the town, but in reality they were bandits, exploiting us to the extreme. We had to provide military rations every three days and military clothing expenses every five days. How could my poor hometown bear it? In less than a month since they came to my hometown, they openly and brutally killed the people in as many as six or seven incidents. The victims were all farmers with more than 20 or 30 mu of land. The reason was nothing more than resisting the payment of military rations, and then they would add the charge of being a traitor. The poor, ignorant villagers did not know where the charge of traitor came from and were shot dead for no reason! A farmer in a certain village had a beautiful wife. When the leader of the Lao Miao team took a fancy to her, the farmer was also charged with being a traitor and was shot dead. Guo Yongquan, who had the qualifications of being a team leader in the plainclothes team, wanted to establish an immortal career in my hometown. He often held a gun and forced farmers to write deeds of alienation. A farmer named Chen was forced to move out of his residence in winter because he owed a few yuan. There are too many similar things to mention. In less than a year since they lived in my hometown, the bandit Guo had accumulated more than 30 or 40 mu of good (?) land. The evil deeds of the others, such as Zhao Xietou and Wang Changji, can be imagined. We poor farmers, who had no one to complain to, were first brutally killed by the Japanese and then bullied by the bandits. We had to pray to the dark heavens, hoping that the Japanese would surrender and that we could avenge ourselves and eliminate the traitors. The news of victory finally reached our ears. The joy at that time was truly indescribable. We fully thought that after the Japanese surrendered, the old central government would arrive. But we were very disappointed. The ones who came a few days after the victory were the Communist army! And the cunning Guo Yongquan and others were still flaunting themselves as underground heroes! I am angry and I hate it. I am angry that we farmers didn't shout louder and I hate that we farmers didn't call out louder, and let the Japanese who brutally killed us still live safely in the concentration camps, and the domineering bandits and gang leaders are still at large, and are still doing who knows what kind of officials! A genuine country bumpkin. 6.8.</p>

<p>— Shao Fu</p>
<p>The usual deathly silence of Nanking Road, like an ancient path placed in the realm of ghosts. Blue Neon Lights, like fireflies; Red Neon Lights, colors of terror. Laughter, commotion, all the daytime clamor, drifted like wisps of smoke to the distant horizon. A void atmosphere, a poet would give it a slight sigh, a silent lament.</p>
<p>A rickshaw appeared, a pedicab, at the corner of Jiangxi Road and Henan Road, their eyes shining as they searched for night walkers, those emerging from the homes of dancing girls, from the mansions of "crab" friends, from many unknown and unnecessary-to-know places... those weary returning guests. They were not making much money, circling in disappointment, night revelers were not yet widespread.</p>
<p>An old Indian doorman, as usual, leaned against the cement wall in front of the Ulo Company on Sichuan Road. I thought, he has a ledger in his mind, meticulously recording the number of vehicles and pedestrians that passed on a certain night, and tonight, the street is a bit different. He no longer remembers the sands of the Ganges and the accumulated snow on the peaks of the Himalayas, does he?</p>
<p>Sichuan Road Bridge, a white maggot crawling on the Suzhou Creek, it tells people that the south is the city, and the north is the countryside. The Hongkou district is even more dilapidated now. If you practice a one-mile marathon, this straight and long Sichuan Road is a good place.</p>
<p>The Shanghai-Woosung Garrison Headquarters, the First Pacification Zone Headquarters, brightly lit, still had three sentries in front of each.</p>
<p>On Jiangwan Road, a continuous line of hawkers carrying vegetables, the curfew has always been an exception for them.</p>
<p>The bright moonlight pours down, tonight, Shanghai is still quiet.</p>
<h3 id="e131">At a Wedding Ceremony, Who Praises the Bride and Groom's Chastity? <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>— Yang Mou</p>
<p>Even though social order is still chaotic, even though human morality is still declining, everyone still wants to preserve some dignity and face for themselves, and no one is willing to admit that they have done something despicable.</p>
<p>For example, even though everyone says that officialdom is corrupt and many cases of embezzlement, dereliction of duty, and bribery occur. But which civil servant is willing to admit to taking bribes? You can't say that there is no bribery in the political world now, but how can you say that there is definitely such a phenomenon in the political world now? Everyone's self-promotion is all about being honest, bright, and great!</p>
<p>However, recently, at the entrance of a certain government office, there were eight large characters pasted: "Taking Bribes and Giving Bribes, Both Will Be Severely Punished," which was startling. The original intention, of course, was to warn those who come and to show justice and honesty, but in fact, this is really superfluous.</p>
<p>At a grand wedding ceremony, all kinds of compliments can be said, but no guest would ever compliment the new couple on their "chastity." If someone really did that, it might cause the new couple great embarrassment. In fact, it is, of course, a matter of course that husband and wife should be chaste.</p>
<p>Places smeared with "No Urinating" or covered with graffiti are often public urinals. Because most Chinese people are the smartest, they can read between the lines, they think that since someone wrote "No Urinating," of course someone has urinated here, and since someone has urinated here, why can't I? Thus, in a grand spectacle, the words "No Urinating" have become the registered trademark of public toilets.</p>
<p>Of course, we don't want to "judge the gentleman's heart with the villain's belly," but for a dignified municipal government agency to post such a notice is a bit tragic! Everyone knows the story of "Hiding Three Hundred Taels of Silver Here, Zhang San Next Door Didn't Steal," and of course we don't want a certain agency's notice to become this kind of reverse writing.</p>
<p>In fact, to ban bribery, it is also very convenient, there is no need for such painstaking effort. As long as every official does not take bribes, then those who offer bribes will have no way to use their skills and will have to disappear. As for officials not taking bribes, that only depends on the supervisor's virtue and rectification, and such "airing dirty linen in public" is, in fact, of little use!</p>

<h3 id="e133">Not a Myth: Fish and Shellfish Speak, Strange Sounds from the Seabed <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>One of our traditional concepts of the sea is: as silent as a tomb. But the sea is not silent. In many parts of the ocean—like Chesapeake Bay (near Virginia in the United States), the Gulf of Mexico, the waters off San Francisco, and the South Pacific—the fish that live there often make various sounds, like the calls of pigs, cows, cats, mice, crows, and frogs, some like groans, and some like loud laughter; in addition, various shrimps and crustaceans make explosive and chirping sounds.</p>
<p>Moreover, these sounds are very noisy, enough to hinder the reconnaissance work of submarines, mines, etc. In the early days of the war, rumors of strange sounds from the seabed spread simultaneously in the headquarters of the U.S. Pacific Fleet and the Atlantic Fleet. Submarine drivers returning from patrols in the Pacific reported that they heard owl calls, pig grunts, and chirping sounds in the ocean near the Philippines. Submariners returning from the coast of Borneo reported hearing mournful groans and the clanging of chains. The operators of underwater detectors sat breathlessly all day, waiting for the faint sound of enemy艇 propellers, when suddenly a fierce and terrifying "glug glug" sound and an explosion-like sound would come from their headphones. The operators inspected the sound detectors and found nothing wrong, and the source of the strange sounds could not be explained.</p>
<p>U.S. Army and Navy personnel and scientists once installed a complex harbor defense system along the Atlantic coast of Chesapeake, using electric wires to connect underwater hydrophones and electric alarms to coastal listening stations, using sound to make warning lights light up. If a German submarine invaded the bay, a light would light up, and if the submarine continued to advance into the bay, then other lights would light up one after another, so that the location of the invading enemy艇 could be known, and then mines could be triggered to blow up the enemy. But this plan did not work as expected. When it was first used, the operator suddenly gasped and shouted, "The entire German Navy has invaded the bay!" Every light was on.</p>
<p>The scientists in charge of the harbor defense equipment hurriedly looked out at the ocean surface, but no fleet was approaching; they took the machine apart to inspect it, and then reassembled it and tried again; all the warning lights still lit up. So they turned off the lights and listened quietly with headphones, and only heard a rough groan and a croaking sound, as if it were coming from all parts of the bay. They could not solve this mystery, so they had to call the wartime research laboratory at Columbia University. The institute specially sent acoustics expert Profut to be responsible for studying this matter. Profut spent a lot of effort, speculating and researching from all aspects, and finally determined from the mouths of fishermen that the sound was emitted from a silver fish called Croaker, which was ten inches long and looked almost like ordinary fish.</p>
<p>Later, Profut got a pair of live Croaker fish, kept them in a large bucket of seawater, and at the same time put a hydrophone into the water, and then retreated to a considerable distance away, and listened quietly with many other scientists. When the two fish had calmed down and realized that they were still alive, the conversation began, and the "gak gak" sound was transmitted from the hydrophone to the ears of the scientists, who all nodded in agreement. The so-called "German navy in full force" turned out to be tens of millions of Croaker fish!</p>
<p>This kind of fish is abundant in Chesapeake Bay, and an average of 40 million pounds are caught every year, which is an important food fish. Another kind called "drum fish" also belongs to this category. It is said that both male and female fish have a gas bubble in their body, shaped like an ordinary bass drum, and due to the twitching of a certain muscle in the abdomen, it makes a "gak gak" sound like drumming. When a large group of these fish gather together, the sound becomes a grand noise.</p>
<p>Profut and other scientists were commissioned by the U.S. Navy to continue to study the sound-emitting fish in the ocean, measure their volume, and determine methods to prevent these sounds from interfering with submarine reconnaissance work. They once heard various sounds like cows mooing, pigs grunting, chickens crowing, and frogs croaking in a certain ocean, which was simply noisier than a farm!</p>
<p>According to research, in addition to the Croaker, the main sound-emitting fish are: sea catfish, pufferfish, hogfish, sandfish, various drumfish, kingfish, iron-mouthed fish, sea eel, blue-winged fish, toadfish, etc. This last kind of fish continuously emits a low-pitched humming sound like a small steamboat whistle, and is said to be the noisiest fish in the ocean.</p>
<p>Some of these fish make sounds by grinding their teeth, some make sounds by compressing air through the trachea, and some make sounds by striking the gas bubble with abdominal muscles.</p>
<p>In addition, scientists have heard several strange sounds in the Pacific Ocean that have not yet been identified as being made by fish: one is the meowing sound of a cat; one is the frightening clanging sound of iron chains, which one submarine captain suspected was a new type of secret weapon of the Japanese; one is the sharp rubbing sound of rusty hinges; one is a miserable groan like a prisoner being tortured, making people suspect that sailors were being sentenced to be tortured at the bottom of the sea for crimes. Others have heard a continuous explosive sound, like burning dry branches and cooking lard in a hot pot.</p>
<p>Five years ago, Howard Smith, director of the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey, heard a mysterious "tick tock" sound in the ocean, which rang continuously from 11:00 every morning, never stopping all year round. After the newspaper announced it, various rumors spread for a while. Some said it was the sound of oil wells pumping oil near the coast, some said it was the sound of cars coming and going on the coastal road, some said it was the sound of ship engines, the sound of electric current generated by the movement of sea sand, the sound of dredging machines, the agitation of dormant volcanoes... The most interesting thing was that a woman wrote to the newspaper, explaining that the sound was due to a team of Chinese people digging a tunnel from China to Los Angeles at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean. She said that she got this clue from her husband, who had traveled around the world and revealed this secret in his sleep!</p>
<p>Finally, three scientists at the Coast and Geodetic Survey discovered the source of the strange sound, which was two kinds of small shrimps. This small animal is about one and a half inches long, very active and combative, and extremely difficult to catch. It has a large carapace and a pair of short and powerful pincers. When the pincers snap together, it makes a faint and crisp ticking sound. They live in groups near coral reefs, numbering in the millions. They compete for food and flap their pincers, and thus make a huge noise, which can be heard at the bottom of the sea a mile away.</p>
<p>In addition, a certain type of shrimp will make a sound like a cricket when frightened, and there is also a kind of crab that lives in the deep sea and makes a sharp sound like a pencil writing on a slate.</p>
<p>Why do these fish and shellfish in the ocean make these kinds of sounds? Scientists have not yet obtained a clear proof. Generally speaking, 5% of the reason is to convey meaning, and 95% is just to make sounds, which is no different from us humans.</p>

<p>In the Singaporean dance scene, Shanghai dancers used to occupy a prominent position. The Liang sisters once held court in Singapore, enjoying the fame of queens and remaining popular for a long time. According to letters from Singapore, there are currently 907 dancers in Singapore, with eight dance halls. The price of a dance ticket varies from one yuan for three dances to one yuan for four dances. The average monthly income of a dancer is about 200 yuan, while those who are more successful can earn 300 to 400 yuan. The "dance queens" can earn up to 800 yuan per month.</p>
<p>Recently, a "child kidnapping case" occurred in Tianjin, causing a great stir. Because children were frequently missing, it plunged housewives, children, and students into a state of terror. Although the police, after investigation, considered it unreliable, rumors continued to circulate in society. Some said that child kidnappers had indeed been arrested recently. Some said that hypnotics were found on them. Still others said that one kidnapper, after being arrested, was tied up by citizens in the square, where he was beaten and scolded, but the kidnapper showed no signs of pain. Later, someone found a plaster on his back, and after removing it, he started to cry out in pain.</p>
<p>At the same time, in the ancient capital not far from Tianjin, a bizarre strange case also occurred. Ye Qiming, a tea server at the New New Cinema, used anesthetics to bewilder women in the cinema and public places, and then sold them. According to the police investigation, within two weeks in May, he had sold as many as 14 beautiful girls under the age of sixteen. According to reports, the anesthetic was prepared by a certain pharmacy in Dong'an Market. After slapping this thing on a woman's head, she would become unconscious and follow his every move, allowing him to do as he pleased. She could only be awakened by spraying her with cold water.</p>
<p>The stalls in Chongqing's Fuzi Pond are becoming increasingly innovative. In the beginning, they were indeed stalls for used goods, but soon they became places for selling new goods and odds and ends, and now they are about to become outlets for foreign goods.</p>

The original text of the notification was as follows: "It is hereby notified that local self-government is the people of this locality using the funds of this locality to handle the affairs of this locality and various administrative undertakings related to it, which is self-government. Now that constitutional government is being implemented and power is being returned to the people, all local affairs should be discussed by convening the masses in accordance with the law. This office plans to submit various issues related to local self-government to public opinion for discussion, and has specially scheduled the meeting to be held at × o'clock on × day of × month at ××× to convene neighborhood chiefs of this office to hold an emergency meeting to discuss all urgent local matters.

<p>— Wuling Ren</p>
<p>The power outage in Nanshi for two nights caused great suffering to the residents. Power outages are common and unremarkable in Chongqing. Perhaps the authorities are afraid that the people who return after the victory will forget the difficult and hard life of the past, and the power outage is also a way to wake people up. Indeed, the present is still a very difficult time!</p>
<p>On the sixth of this month, another female panda was captured in Wenchuan, Sichuan, smaller than the one previously given to England. Where it will be sent is being requested from the provincial government. At the same time, according to a Nanjing telegram, there are a large number of stray dogs in Nanjing, and the cleaning team of the health bureau has been killing more than a thousand of them in recent days. Rarity is valuable, which is not surprising. When all the dogs in the world are killed one day, those that survive will inevitably be valued by people. They will be called "Miss," airlifted to foreign countries, and the dogs will "take off," which is also expected.</p>
<p>Amidst the uproar over the grain loan scandal, it was suddenly reported that Yang Xizhi would return from the United States to take up a new position in the Storage and Transportation Bureau, which can also be considered a kind of satire.</p>
<p>Wuxi held a ball game for the Respect Teachers Movement, and the mermaid Yang Xiuqiong was invited to the venue to kick off the game. The county magistrate held a lavish banquet, which cost more than 300,000 yuan, which caused criticism. Japanese Prime Minister Yoshida invited political leaders to a dinner to discuss the grain shortage crisis, but he used delicacies and fine wines to treat the guests. One of the guests, upon seeing the table full of delicacies, immediately shouted about rice, saying that the Prime Minister should not be so extravagant, and resolutely refused to eat, and left in anger.</p>
<p>I hold the "eat-as-much-as-you-can" principle, so if I were a guest, I would definitely just eat without worrying about the bill, why bother to think so much? I would never be as angry as the guests invited by the Japanese Prime Minister. If the Japanese were really all sensible, they would not have been so miserably defeated today.</p>

<p>Medical and Health</p>
<p>(1) Jinshan's Renfu asks: My feet have been swollen since last winter until now, day and night, very severely, never ceasing. At first, I suspected that it was caused by the cold, so I used medicinal wine to rub them, but it didn't work. Then I was afraid that the blood was not flowing properly, so I drank medicinal wine to promote blood circulation, but it didn't work either. I think my feet are moving appropriately, I have never had excessive activity or inactivity, and my body is also healthy. I don't know what the disease is? What treatment is available? Please ask Dr. Zhang to answer.</p>
<p>(Answer from Dr. Zhang Zhongming) Your illness is probably rheumatic arthritis. You should take Atophau tablets or inject Nonalgin injections, which can be effective.</p>
<p>(2) Shi Mingfu asks: My father is a senile old man in his seventies, and he contracted tertian malaria two years ago. He was already a candle in the wind, how could he withstand the ravages of the disease? So every time the disease occurs, he always vomits, and sometimes even vomits a little blood. He is naturally unable to bear the pain, so he cannot help but groan and shout. Sir: How can a son bear it? Therefore, doctors were consulted from all sides, and medicines were tried, but none were effective. It recurred and relapsed for nearly three years. I am heartbroken and really have no way to deal with it. Knowing that your newspaper helps people solve problems without reservation, I take the liberty of asking if there is any special medicine? Please tell me the name of the medicine in detail. I will be very grateful.</p>
<p>(Answer from Dr. Zhang Zhongming) Elderly people suffering from malaria can use Atebrine tablets, which are very effective and have few side effects.</p>
<p>(3) Xu Rong asks: Fifteen years ago, I injured my left ribs due to carrying a heavy load and falling. At that time, I felt shortness of breath. Before a month had passed, I started coughing violently. Although I coughed and stopped from time to time since then, my body became thinner day by day. After half a year, my waist became sore and I couldn't sit for long. X-ray fluoroscopy showed that my right lung had pleurisy, which has now healed, and my left lung and heart are normal. Now I cough and wheeze as before, especially at night. Please enlighten me as to what disease it is and to what extent it has progressed.</p>
<p>(Answer from Dr. Zhang Zhongming) The symptoms you describe are probably caused by the spread of tuberculosis bacteria and physical weakness. You should rest more, pay attention to nutrition, and eat more various vitamins and cod liver oil and other supplements.</p>

Those in need can go to the Social Services column of this newspaper or directly to the pharmacy at Xinza Road, Methes Road (i.e., east of Xinjiayuan) to obtain it.</p>
<p>Free Distribution of Seaweed: In the third item of the reply to the reader on June 12 in your column, Zhang Ziju asked about drugs for thyroid swelling. I have a kind of edible seaweed, which has been tested by the laboratory and found to contain 1% iodine. I would like to donate it to Mr. Zhang for a trial. Please introduce me. (Qiu Tang: Residing at No. 3, Lane 150, Shaoxing Road, Shanghai)</p>

<p>Dear Editor: Every morning when I go to school, there are small cloth packages about two feet long on the sidewalk, tightly bound with straw ropes. After a few turns, one is discovered. I was completely confused, what are these things? After a few days, I went to see them again, and they were still there, and the positions had not moved. However, after being exposed to rain and sun, the color of the cloth seemed a little old, and the ropes had also been broken. My curiosity made me unable to restrain myself, and I told my classmates about this. A fat classmate was very brave and untied one of the small packages to observe. What is this? Ah! I can't believe it, a child, probably a few months old, lying stiffly and sleeping forever in the package! Dear Editor, I really can't believe it. Have those police officers and cleaning officers seen it usually? If no measures are taken to eliminate these small packages, then all the diseases in Shanghai will become even more rampant. Sir, what is your opinion? Wan Jiushui, No. 42, Jishifei Road, Shanghai. 6.12.</p>
