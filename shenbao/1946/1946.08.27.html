<h3>中共對時局聲明　周恩來昨在京正式發表</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京廿六日電〕中共代表團，廿六日下午三時半招待新開界，由周恩來主持，招待會中散發新華社所印羣衆週刋社論「立即無條件停戰，實行政協決議」一文之提要，以作爲中共對於時局之正式聲明。該聲明略稱：八月廿五日上海出版之「羣衆」上發表一篇針對蔣主席八月十四日文吿的長篇社論，題爲「立即無條件停戰，實行政協決議」，我認爲蔣主席的這一文吿「不僅未能改變這種局勢，而且　惡化這一局勢」，「因爲他所提出的停戰條件，是要中共部隊撤出許多地區，並將當地民選政府取消，由國民黨一黨政府來接收」。社論指出政府當局如何推翻停戰政協整軍等等協定，例如「在一月停戰協定宣布後，政府方面始終不實行東北停戰，不接受馬歇爾將軍提議並爲中共所立即贊同的派遣執行小組到果北，後來雖有三月廿七日協議，得以派遣小組到東北，但政府方面却又遠約，拒絕停戰，且在東北大打，直至六月休戰，東北進攻始稍和緩，而關內進攻又遍於大河南北。國民黨政府至今獨佔據我解放區的縣城五十九座，村莊三千多處一。</p>
<p>在六月休戰協商中，中共爲力一求達到和平願望，在東北停戰，恢復交通與整軍問題等補充協議中，均已不惜作重大讓步，「可是在商談中，政府當局曾無理的提出美方最後决定厭問……，協議將成，政府忽又要求中共部隊及地方民選政府須撤出蘇北，膠濟路沿錢，熱河承德以南及安東四處，吾則四項協議不能簽字，停戰即難實現」。中共「認爲實施整軍方案的軍隊駐地，決不能與地方行政混爲一談，而地方政權問題，在政協綱領附記中，已有明文規定，乃堅決拒絕這種超出休戰協商項目的要求」。八月一初，政府當局經由司徒大使提出的五項要求，竟愈提愈多，當局並以目前「要求作爲全面停戰與商談政府改組的先決條件」。　「政府不僅破　停戰整軍及恢復交通等協議，　且早已推　政協五項決議與蔣　席的四項諾言」。例如，關於改組政府，「政府對委員名額與三分之一的否決權，始終不依決義商定，而且違反決議，要在國民黨中央常委會上，遴選道些其他黨派與無黨派的委員」。又如「關於國民大會決議，先因政府未曾改組，憲草審議米定，各方面未便提交代表名單，後因政府方面提議增加名額，致代表比例又未商妥，及至五五期近，政協綜合小組在蔣主席召集下，乃決定國大延期，並說明待各事商妥後，再定召開日期，不意七月三號政府沁局竟不經政協協商，逕自宣布本年十一月十二日召開國大　於是政協決議就掃地無餘」。</p>
<p>社論指出「國民黨之所以敢於推翻政協，主要原因之一是由於美國政府不論在任何情況下，都給他們以幫助，　論接着又指出，以這個問題上，馬歇爾將軍不能不負相當責任，然而馬歇爾將軍與司徒大使的處處，不是不可能成功的」。</p>
<p>社論最後分析蔣主席文吿中所提出第六項方針，指出前述的五項要求是他的中心所在，「中心就是中共不撤出若干地區，戰爭就不能停止，社論鮮明地說明了案，商定國大代表，推定由各方人士參加的各種委員會等事，更非政協莫辦」。</p>

<h3>殺害張莘夫之凶犯　莫廣成供述經過　全係共軍預謀真相大白</h3>
<p>〔本報瀋陽廿五日電〕震驚關內外之張莘夫被殺案，主要凶手莫廣成，於七月上旬在葫蘆島被捕，經九十三軍解錦第一集團軍總司令部，復於本月十九日轉解來瀋，經長官部軍法處審訊，莫犯供認刺殺張莘夫係共有計劃之預謀，當時彼係奉遼東軍區第八旅旅部命令，當殺張之日，共軍保安旅副司令劉子義亦在李石寨車站．莫犯係遵化縣鐵厰鎮下格莊人，據供稱：弟兄五人，均參加八路軍，彼最小，四個兄長均於抗日戰中陣亡，共軍齣關時，彼在十二團一營二連充排長，在錦迤時改編為廿三團三營七連，充副連長，并代理連長。</p>
<h3>全部供詞</h3>
<p>莫犯繼供稱殺張時，我駐防李石寨，奉到第八旅旅部令，說接收人員之火車已經通過，若曏瀋陽開回時，一定要把該車拘押，并將車中各人加以逮逋，否則軍法從事。當時務團長為了此事，整日奔走各車站，我也几沒睡覺，有一天（日期忘了）突接電話說，該車將開回瀋陽，命我暫勿逮逋張莘夫等，讓其至深井子再動手。是日午後九時左右，保安旅副司令劉子義到李石寨車站，我因有事去營部，劉副司令對駐站之排長陳貴東說，接收撫順煤礦的火車即將開回，國中交有八路軍的郭政委與蘇軍的少校（名字不曉得），與蘇軍士兵若干名同行，命陳排長把車中所有人員加以逮捕，我從營部回來時候，張莘夫及其隨員八名，已被綁在車站，大衣已被脫去，只穿着便衣，當時蘇軍已乘火車溜了，把保護張莘夫之責任完全推卸不理，後來劉副司令就命令我把張莘夫等傳到野外去，郭政委同樣的命令着我，同時還說張莘夫是大漢奸，我為了他們不是我直屬的長官，同時這命令又不知確實否，以後若根究起來，我可負責不了，故我不肯執行，劉副司令就派二名警衛兵，強迫我把張莘夫殺死，我在威迫之下，只得將張莘夫等帶至南山坡，命令我的士兵用刺刀殺死，張莘夫臨死前默無一語，若無其事，然態度強硬，其隨員卻像一條可憐虫，在哀求不要殺死他們，可是都殺死了，那時約在晚上十點左右，次日，劉副司令將我叫到撫順司令部，問我有何感想，我說沒有，直接長官命令，恐怕將來發生意外；他說絕對與我沒關係，他可完全負責。約十餘天後，蘇軍司令又將我傳到他們司令部，問我執行張等時是否有蘇軍參加及同情否，我說車上有蘇軍，執行時沒參加，大概他們也同情。我并說此事完全是保安司令劉子義和郭政委的主意。後來部隊出發了，我被蘇軍扣了四十多天，蘇軍司令由長春返瀋後，才將我放回，那時隊伍已往遼陽了，在遼陽就和中央軍作起戰來，我們奉命退長春，再由長春開大虎山休息，那時我就帶了十個人開小差，想向國軍投誠，在半路與八路衝突，被衝散了，打算回家，知家鄉還有八路軍，所以改在葫蘆島經營小生意本錢是手錶賣得五萬國幣，買賣煙捲，放在島池趙培雲家，我也住在他家裏，住了十餘天被捕，有個官長時常着便衣，向我買煙，事後才知道他是駐軍團部官長等語。綜觀莫犯供述，足資證明共軍陰謀及該案關係國際上之重大，張莘夫被害案真相於茲大白。</p>

<h3>美大滬剩餘物資　證實被非法出賣　麥克布宣稱已在偵查中</h3>
<p>〔合眾社本市訊〕據權威方面消息：美國國外剩餘物資清理處上海辦事處有違法處置物資，致美國納稅人損失幾近數百萬美金情事，頃已被下令澈查。據稱，偵查範圍有下述數項：（一）將價值數百萬美元完好可用之飛機，以五十十萬美元之價格售予中央航空公司；（二）將美國空軍移交時標明「新」，「完好」，「大致完好」等狀態之剩餘飛機另件及配備，重行歸類，標為「清貨」出售，原值數十萬美元者，僅售得數千美元；（三）將原與一美國商行訂定之合同取消，嗣後轉售與中國方面，所獲售價及美商出價之一部分，此項同一物資其后復由承購人以高價賣與該美商；（四）上海辦事處漠視售賣剩餘物資時關於優先承購權之規定；（五）在未訂定合同，未議妥價格之前，擅將數百萬美元之船隻及其他設備交與中國方面（其中若干船隻，現悉已遭中國方面所拒絕，蓋中國曾耗巨資修理，要求美國償還）。據稱，調查人員對若干清理處官員之生活方式亦感興趣，某數人有極奢侈之私宅，至少其中有一人現確實住居於上海最華貴之一住宅中，該項房屋即為購買國外清理處物資一大主顧所有之產業。</p>
<p>同時，若干清理處官員被控違反規章，擅自與中國官方或商業機關商洽兼職，現此事亦已在調查中。又據獲悉，美國外清理處上海辦事處內部，曾因督察麥開那對若干合同認有疑義而致迭起紛爭。麥氏且曾因此憤而辭職，以示對清理處在華工作之抗議。對上海辦事處現局之正式偵查，一俟督察馬迪自華盛頓抵達此間後即可開始。馬氏係在違法貪污案之報告抵達華府後，特由總處派來澈查之人。</p>
<p>該權威方面又稱：迄今為止，調查殆猶未正式開始。現已有人建議，若此項調查在當地不能迅速獲得一滿意之結果，參院梅特委員會或美國司法部或將干預，因該案內幕複雜，且實際上有陸海軍及文職人員牽連在內也。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕目前正在滬進行調查工作之美國國外物資清理處處長麥克佈氏，當獲睹合眾社消息以後，已對該案加以證實。渠於昨日發表文告宣稱：「關於美在滬剩餘物資被控非法出賣一案，確已在偵查中」。該項控訴，據麥稱，係於七月廿四日傳抵其華盛頓辦事處，彼立即派督察來滬詳細偵查，麥氏本人來滬後，上海辦事處處長瓊遜曾　求由美軍總部同時偵查，刻亦已在進行中。麥克佈稱：「調查結束後，將發佈適當之文告」。并謂：對任何違法案件迅速偵查，乃清理處之一貫政策云云。</p>

<h3>價值四十億物資　第六戰區兵站總監擅自處分　武漢清查團已提出質詢</h3>
<p>〔本報漢口廿五日電〕關於前第六戰區兵站總監部留用接收物資，經清查團向該部提出質詢，并調閱有關文卷後，認為此價值四十萬以上之物資，竟被該部擅自處分，實為絕大遺憾，爰於今晚發表清查經過，公開予以指責，措詞頗為嚴峻，茲摘要點如下：甲，此項物資之留用分配，事先未曾呈請中央核示，僅於事後報請軍政部備核。乙，所配發之百四十餘種物資，不惟數量鉅大，且大部分為非軍用物品。丙，軍政部據報後，不僅未予核準，且曾以超越接收範圍，婉詞予以譴責，并指示該項物資應由經濟部標賣。丁，長官部於軍政部未准所請後，仍陸續留用配發。戊，本案情節重大，決即呈請中央指示處理辦法，且配發婁字與受領人數不符。</p>

<p>社論</p>
<h3>中共發表聲明以後</h3>
<p>國共的爭端，到昨天，因中共聲明的發表而更令人迷惘了！</p>
<p>自馬帥與司徒大使於本月十日性發表聯合聲明，發出嚴重警告之後，談判固到了最後關頭，各地的衝突也愈演愈烈。幸　蔣主席一秉和平的初衷，於十四日發表告全國國民書，昭示六項政治解決的方針，不特為全國人民所擁護，抑且獲得友邦的好評。詎意中共反認　蔣主席的文告是政府「準備軍事攻勢」的表示，因此延安頒發動員令，并公然宣佈戰爭狀態的存在，同時在軍事上加緊圍攻大同，而隴海路東段的大戰亦由此爆發。</p>
<p>但中共也知道人民不盡可欺，故在口頭上又改變論調，說頒發動員令并非宣戰之謂，同時又宣佈中央亦將發表聲明，用以答覆　蔣主席的主告。可是它的聲明，一再修正內容，直到昨天下午三時，始在南京發表。這一個聲明，我們雖期待已久，也以為對於今後時局的發展，或可增添一二決定的因素，但是我們披閱一遍，還是覺得中共徒有高明的手法，而無真正企求和平的誠意，更弄得我們如墮五里霧中了。</p>
<p>中共聲明中依然唱其「立即無條件停戰」的濫調，但試問動員令是誰頒發的？再看圍攻大同是誰的部隊？鐵一般的事實是不能否認的。一年以來，中國大局，究竟誰在進攻？誰係被迫？誰欲戰爭？誰願和平？中國人民看得很明白，用不着再作宣傳戰，再作神經戰。記得中共在東北攻佔長春進窺哈爾濱的時候，他們在口頭上也喊着無條件停戰的口號。這樣的言行不符，早已不止一次！</p>
<p>至於「實行政協決議」，說來更好笑了。政府對於政協決議，原有實行的決心。假如沒有中共的背約失信，這些協議早已實行了。而且在事實上，政府於國軍的整編·復員·以及退役等事項，均已第次實行，善於這一層，友邦調人馬歇爾特使也是承認的。但在中共方面，不但不履行統編的基本方案，而且在各地招兵買馬，拼命擴充軍隊，這又何統？又如改組政府，政府在三四月間，再三邀請中共開出名單，而中共故意拖宕。召開國大，中共也不如約推出代表人選，反在東北大動干戈，甚至馬歇爾特使幾次三番要求「中共退出長春以後，再談其他問題」，中共也始終置若罔聞，拒不接受，中央遂不得不用兵收復長春。然中央在六月間仍下令停戰，以待磋商，可是至今沒有結果。</p>
<p>我們站在人民的立場，今再向國共雙方呼籲：民生憔悴，於今為甚。目下所需要的，是安居，是樂業。中共為珍惜自己的前途計，應接受人民的公意，懸崖勒馬，勿為內亂的戎首。···</p>
<p>中共既曰立即無條件停戰，實行政協決議，就該言行一致，立即放下武器，與政府斷續進行和平談判，對於同時實行「政治民主化」與「軍隊國家化」兩項原則，商得一個切實而有效的辦法。政府在此期間，為表示大公無私以及盡其在我的精神起見，亦應自動擴大政府的基礎，力求效率及廉潔，并肅清一切官僚腐敗的積習，從而造成優良的政風，然後再進一步，修正憲法草案，如期召開國民大會，以走上憲政的正軌。</p>
<h3>聞案的宣判</h3>
<p>聞案判決，業經發表，主犯湯時亮李文山兩名，判處死刑，案經陸軍總司令顧祝同呈報　主席，一俟奉準，既當執行，同時昆明警備總司令霍揆章，統率無方，有失職守，亦經革職看管，聽候法辦。至此，轟動一時的聞案，告一結束。我們對於本案，在真相未明以前，不便有所論列，茲當案已結束，顧一述及我們的觀感：</p>
<p>暗殺案件動機雖不一，但國家有法典，凶犯斷難倖逃國法的制裁。當我們聽到聯大教授聞一多被暗殺的消息以後，我們痛惜這位學人的被狙擊以死，致國家失了對本國使國家法紀，社會秩序，都蒙受了不良的影響。至於緝兇徵辦，那自有國家的機構主持其事，在凶犯未獲真相未白之際，正不必多所猜測附會。現在的聞案判決，暗殺動機，實至單純，既沒有什麼指使，更無所謂的政治作用，實係凶犯一時血氣衝動的仇殺行為，可見并不能讓政客們作為一種政治資本來擴大宣傳的。</p>
<p>第二，對於處理暗殺案件，國家原有機構，專司其事，聞教授的被暗殺，與任何人的被暗殺，事同一例。在任何國家，暗殺案件几不能免，故各國法典，對於暗殺事件的審判，都有明文規定。今聞教授之死，國家特派陸軍總司令主持調查審判，此固足以表示我政府當局對本案之重視，實亦非國家應有之當經。試問在英美乃至蘇聯，是否有因一位大學教授被殺，而由其陸軍總司令主持調查審判其事者？今國家當多事之會，政府為澈查案情，秉公處理，乃不得不派大員主持，而審判結果，亦復公正無私，凡此種種，應為國人所共諒了。</p>
<p>現在聞案既經判決，一俟主犯處死，此案即可結束。關於李公樸一案，凶犯迄聞緝獲，以是案情乞未大白。我們只有切望政府加緊緝凶，敢信破案有日，全案真相亦終有水落石出的一天，好事之徒正不必多所揣測。惟據聞案判決書內所發表之犯罪事實，此案起因，由於聞教授在李公樸追悼大會中所發演說，詆毀政府，對於軍人更多侮辱，凶犯激於義憤，乃動殺機。我們對於凶犯的觸犯刑章，固認為絕無可恕，而所感到扼腕的，以聞教授這樣多才多藝的人物，身為國立大學的教授，而乃公然詆毀政府，甚至侮辱軍人，以致身為下級軍官者，智識不及聞氏，又當血氣方剛之年，乃有越出常軌之慘案。軍人，原如任何職業界的人一樣，雖不免良莠不齊，但執干戈以衛社稷的到底還是軍人，他們身經百戰，備嘗艱苦，應該值得我們的敬愛。聞教授生在一個動盪的時代，他的死，值得我們的痛惜，但是也值得我們深思。中國缺少人才，我們要十分珍惜這少數的人才；而為了民族，我們尤其希望這少數人才更應珍惜他們自己。</p>
<h3>政府能否抑平紗價？</h3>
<p>上星期一調整外匯後，一週來物價大致平穩，尤以米和麵粉為最少上落；黃金雖一度竄高，但旋即回降，與未調整前的市價也相差不多。惟有棉紗卻不然！</p>
<p>昨日黑市，廿支雙馬成交為一八二萬，收市稍回也要一七八萬元，與前週六的一三六萬元較，竟漲起四二萬元，達百分之三三。四十二支藍鳳收市到二四六萬元，與前週六的一九〇萬相比，高起五五萬元，也漲了三成。如政府還袖手旁觀。可能續漲。</p>
<p>我們早已指出，外匯調整而後，果真要控制物價，不使騰漲，政府必須用全力制於機先。中央常會討論時所主張必須控制三類物價，即（一）民生日用必需品如米煤油鹽花紗布等，（二）交通運輸及公用事業，（三）換算標準的黃金，務使勿漲，我們深具同感。而今，政府自稱控制大量生產的棉紗，竟有連日暴漲的惡影響，這責任應該誰負的？</p>
<p>據報，中紡公司因為董事會的決議，遵從政府不許漲價的指示，昨天拋售紗價，廿支藍鳳為一一六萬元，四十二支藍鳳為一九〇萬元，仍和前週六外匯米調整前相同，而外間黑市，前者已到一五〇萬，後者竟到二四六萬。我們第一要問：政府究竟管不管？對做漲價的黑市者究竟罰不罰？第二要問：中紡照常配送的紗，是否聽令領賣的紗布商一轉手之間穩賺四王十萬元一包，而熟視無覩？第三要問：在外匯調整的那一天，市府似乎曾雷厲風行的要穩定物價，同業公會也似乎願同心協力來維持原價，現在市政府怎樣辦？同業公會這樣說？</p>
<p>我們以為物價是一個大環，決非不能讓人沖破一節的，否則牽一發動全身，紗價的漲可能引起他種物價的漲，今天政府能否抑平紗價，就是他日能否穩定一般物價的試金石。</p>

<h3>澳代表提議設置委會　處理賠償招待事項　以不威脅敗國政治獨立為原則　南國要求義鉅額賠款</h3>
<p>〔本報綜合消息〕據倫敦廿六日廣播：南斯拉夫代表團今日於和會中正式提出，要求義大利賠款十三萬萬元，按此數較四强前決定義大利應償蘇聯之賠款尙多十四倍。南斯拉夫之要求中，主張將義大利之工廠及機器牛教曁剩餘商船一部撥給南斯拉夫，作爲賠款之一部分。　同時，今日和會中巴爾幹經濟委員會開會討論對羅馬尼亞和約中之經濟條款時，澳洲代表提議，由四强及其他選出之任何三國，組織盟國賠款委員會，以處理和約中關於賠償條款之執行，同時特別注意該戰敗國是否有無能力繼續償付賠款。按今日討論對羅和約時，規定羅馬尼亞應價付蘇聯價値三億元之貨物作爲賠款，分八年付淸。澳代表稱，澳洲不欲向任何巴爾幹國家要求賠款，但恐數目過鉅之賠款，勢必將威脅此等國家之政治獨立地位。吾人應帮助戰敗國於國際間站定脚跟，將來成爲一獨立之國家。澳代表主張，任何前敵國不應直接將賠償之貨物交付勝利國，而應交由賠款委會轉收，折算賠款，如此可使戰敗國祇與聯合國發生關係，而不與戰勝國直接接觸，如此則較可保持其國家之完全主權。</p>
<h3>巴爾幹委會席上　蘇澳代表激辯　蘇擬減少對匈賠款要求</h3>
<p>據法國新聞社訊：巴黎和會廿六日繼續開會，議程如次：（一）對義政治及領土委會定於午前十時開會，（二）巴爾幹委會開會，（三）軍事委員會開會，（四）對義經濟委曾於午後四時開會，（五）對保加利亞政治及領土委會亦定於午後四時開會。</p>
<p>據巴黎廿六日廣播：巴爾幹委員會開會時，莫洛托夫起立發表極冗長之演說，駁斥澳洲代表之辯論。略謂德軍之侵攻蘇聯，由於安托納斯古法西斯軍之協助，渠又追述一九四一年間羅馬尼亞軍隊侵入烏克蘭，並加以佔據之事實，謂蘇聯在任何情形下，決不忘却此等事實。莫氏繼稱，羅國休戰協定條款之簽訂，不僅由蘇聯參加，美國亦在其內，此間發生問題之對羅和約條文，係公正而具有良好之根據者。對羅馬尼亞戰後所處經濟狀况，蘇聯認爲業已相當困難，出席和會之羅國代表團，並未反對條約內有關賠償之條款，而澳代表對此問題所表示之關切興趣，似更有甚於羅人自己者，然澳洲却遠在千萬哩之外，澳洲代表提議用英鎊或美元現款賠償，此即暗示羅國將倚賴英美幣制之意耳。但此法並不眞正有利於羅國，反足加重其處境之嚴重。莫氏指稱，蘇羅兩國間所訂賠償問題之協定，比較合理，澳洲所提建議，其性質不足以穩定歐洲之和平，且對澳洲自身毫無利益，故盼澳代表團撤回其修正建議，因四强外長會議所擬草案內之第廿二條，供給一切利點與保證。法文譯本明晨可提交，至此會議乃吿閉幕。此後會議將繼續審查並討論第廿二條。</p>
<p>據聯合社巴黎廿六日電：蘇聯即將宣佈减少其對匈牙利之賠款要求，减少數目尙未宣佈，但聞相當可觀，足以保證匈牙利無需在痛苦的平衡基礎上，恢復其經濟。蘇聯並允許以更多原料分配匈牙利各工廠，實行匈蘇互惠。</p>
<h3>五國和約草案　五萬字待斟酌</h3>
<p>〔聯合社巴黎電〕義大利政治領土委會廿六日又採納對義和約序文十八字，和會開會四星期以來，共採納一百五十三字。五戰敗國和約尙有五萬五千字須待斟酌，其他四草約迄無任何進展。通過之十八字，包括在序文第四節中，經一小時辯論後，一致通過，使南斯拉夫棄權，修正案係荷蘭代表提出，目的在擴大承認墨索里尼政權推翻後，義大利對盟國之援助。經略加修正後終於通過。</p>
<h3>加速和會工作　籌備四強會議</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社電〕倫敦外交界人士頃談稱：一俟英外相貝文返抵巴黎之後，即將採取步驟，籌備舉行四强會議，俾能加速和會工作，如四强會議不克舉行，則和會將延至本年年底，而重要問題例如對德對日問題等均不能解決。和會若干國代表團團長已離巴黎，澳外長伊伐特廿四晚已啓程返國，加拿大總理麥根西金廿五晨出發取道倫敦返國。美出席和會代表范登堡，乘坐杜魯門總統之專機「聖牛」號，廿五日飛抵巴黎。</p>

<h3>義大利總理　獲內閣信任</h3>
<p>〔合衆社羅馬廿六日電〕義首相加斯貝利在巴黎和會中提出報告，希望緩和對義條件後三小時，義內閣一致通過對彼之信任案。加氏對全體閣員解釋稱：渠曾要求各國展期討論特港問題，因四强不能覓求適當之妥協，同時渠準備興南斯拉夫直接談判此問題。</p>
<h3>鳥克蘭控訴希臘　安理會列入議程　英認此舉為蘇聯前奏砲聲　欲迫使英美退出多瑙河區</h3>

<h3>蘇聯發出驚人消息　英國在韃靼尼爾　設軍事供應基地　普建雷達站偵察潛艇</h3>
<p>〔路透社莫斯科廿五日電〕蘇聯通訊社貝魯特電述「當地人士」之報吿稱，英國已在韃靼尼爾設立軍事供應基地，伊斯坦埠附近之一土耳其飛機塲，亦已附屬於英人。該一軍事基地，據云與伊拉克巴斯拉之基地形式相仿，飛機塲則位於埃斯吉爾尼。蘇通訊社謂當地人士曾謂在希臘之色雷斯及土耳其之黑海沿岸，英軍事專家設有一雷達站，以偵察潛水艇，貝魯特之報吿復謂，伊斯坦埠與波育克台爾間一雷達站之英籍軍事顧問及敎，官以辭職爲要挾，要求直接担任該一雷達站之指揮，土當局旋即接受其要求，委其任站長，另派土軍官一人爲助手。土耳其通訊社昨　聲明謂：蘇通訊社由英人監督在土境築飛機塲之說爲無稽之談。</p>

<p>又路透社倫敦電，英外交部發言人今夜指稱，鳥克蘭所稱希臘境內駐有英軍，將稱成對和平之威脅一節，僅係蘇聯在歐集團之「外交反攻」而已。今烏克蘭代表之行動，實爲對西方國家允其是英國最近之聯合能度，企圖予以報復。此間人士之觀感則謂，蘇聯衛星國之此項行動，並非一種單獨事件，亦爲蘇聯政府將有所活動之前奏砲聲。其內在目的乃欲建立其進佔地位，以迫使西方國家完全退出多瑙河區。</p>

<h3>柏特森報告送達華府　美南事件告一段落　南允為被難人員舉行盛大殯儀</h3>
<p>〔本報綜合消息〕南斯拉夫對於美國最後通牒之態度，國務　已接獲美駐　大使柏特森自貝爾格勒發來之報吿。據美新聞處華盛頓廿五日電，該報吿中曾詳細叙述其與蒂托元帥歷次交涉之經過。其一切情形，木報數日來已皆先後報導，茲不贅述。約路言之，南斯拉夫雖未於文字上表示屈服，但實際上已全部實行美國最後通牒中之要求。在此種情形下，美國政府將視南國政府「糾正其錯過之工作如何及今後之事實發展情形決定對策」。關於十九日被擊落之第二架美機，茲證明其中飛行負五人均已罹難，遺體定廿七日運往貝爾格勒。據聯合社貝爾格勒廿五日電，南斯拉夫當局已允爲被難之美國航空員舉行盛大殯儀。據美國大使館宣布，南第四軍軍官數人將會同喪儀隊前往死難美機員安葬之公墓運出造骸，然後由國旗裏掩之殯車駛過　扦總統之避暑別墅，而回到吉布拉那。遺骸運往貝爾格勒時，南斯拉夫戰鬥機一隊將護衛美大使柏特森之專機同往京城</p>
<p>雖然此事可謂暫吿一段落，但並不即能解釋爲美南間之惡化關係已吿休止。據巴黎方面消息，蒂托元帥可能向聯合國提出控訴，指責英美飛機「已千百次」飛越南國領土，彼認爲此舉係侵犯南國主權，並意圖威脅南國，同時，據合衆社訊，華盛頓方面美外交界相信，美南與美蘇之間實尙有種種基本問題阻梗其間，隨時可能爆發，舉例言之，如特里埃斯特及韃靼尼爾海峽等是。</p>

<h3>國際法庭審判長斷定　溥儀員係一傀儡　所訂賣國條約包括要點四項　辯護人方面仍繼續加緊反質</h3>
<p>〔改造社東京廿六日電〕僞滿皇帝溥儀在國際法庭作證，已歷一週，今日卒被審判長判定爲傀儡。辯護人方面仍繼續盤問，淸瀨首先訊問溥儀就任「元首」時，是否提出兩項條件？即（一）試行政治兩年，（二）試行結果，如有違三千萬民衆之期望，即行辭職。溥儀答謂有此事。又問就任「執政」前，有無將「契約書」手交本莊司令官？淸瀨旋即提出證據文件</p>
<p>溥儀答稱：上週頭腦混亂，不知是此物，此物全係關東軍一方面之文件，當時係在</p>
<p>關東軍壓迫下，無條件承認者。淸瀨又問溥儀第一次訪日後所頒「詔書」，是否出自本意？溥儀答：未嘗指示頒布此種詔書，當時自己一切爲吉岡中將所操縱。淸瀨又提出林出所著：「扈從訪日記」一書，朗誦其中所載溥儀所作詩。溥儀答稱：此種詩不過是外交辭令。又稱當時吉罔作爲關東軍司令部之一員，隨同來日。淸瀨復問</p>
<p>偽滿宗教情形</p>
<p>，溥儀答稱：吉岡曾謂：神廟以外之宗敎，均將廢止，並强迫軍歐及學校設祭神廟。淸瀨　問溥儀之妻是被毒斃？抑係因葡萄糖不足而被殺害。　儀復陳上次所述，並稱根據周圍情形，判斷其妻係被毒斃。經過以上問答後，審判長終宣稱：「我等決定本證人係傀儡。繼續進行反對訊問，空費時間。」然淸瀨繼續訊問：「一九四一年十二月八日，非曾頒詔謂舉全力援助日本乎？」答：「此事亦係日方所謂。」問：「一九四五年八月二十日，證人飛抵瀋陽機塲時，曾否對「保安總司令官」稻葉虎雄謂：余感謝日本「天皇」及國民，然</p>
<p>萬事不能如意</p>
<p>？」答：「余不知此人。」其次由辯護人岡本提出　儀先生瓊斯頓所著：「紫禁城之黃昏」一書，問溥儀該書序文上所蓋「宣統御鹽」，是否屬溥儀之物？溥儀支吾其辭，經審判長斥責，乃稱「名係鄭孝胥所署，御聽則因鄭孝胥擅自據有，故不知其詳。」岡本欲斷定其係溥儀之物，言語裁定官穆阿少校稱：「證人係謂：筆續並非余之筆　，印雖係余之各，但不知是否係余之物。」檢察官季楠對此表示不滿，謂：穆阿上校不解　國語。」穆阿上校乃謂：「東方人一旦被責其失言，即欲避免回答。」我國檢察官憤然表示此語侮辱東方人，結果由</p>
<p>穆阿上校道歉</p>
<p>了事。岡本乃又繼續訊問，溥儀供稱：「印章約有二百方，然似爲鄭孝胥，羅振玉所用，但未界與彼等以使用之權，瓊斯登所著書序文上之印，雖係余之物，然不知係何時所用。又該書所述北平事，雖無錯誤，然余未嘗與著者在天津同居，其所述余不負責任。」問：「誰任命鄭孝胥爲「滿洲國」總理？」答：「係由本莊司令官先行決定，而後示余者。」問：「證人屢謂收復失地，究竟爲誰收復？」答：「中國。」問：「一九三一年時，曾希望中日協力吾？」答：「無此事。」問：「知日本政府對東北事變本係消極否？」答：「日本政府之所行與所言，恒不一致。」</p>
<p>賣國條約內容</p>
<p>〔聯合社東京廿六日電〕傀儡皇帝溥儀今日續在國際法庭作證，承認曾與關東軍簽訂賣國條約。條約原文係東條之辯護人淸瀨所提出，乃溥儀出任僞帝前簽訂，其要點如下：（一）僞滿國防及法令之行施權，移讓日本；（二）現有港中·水道。鐵路及公路，歸日本管理，日本爲國防需要起見，得開關新港；（三）僞滿對於日軍認爲必要之設備，必須給予一切援助；（四）有遠見卓識之日人，應任爲國務顧問；（五）以上四條爲日滿未來條約之基礎。淸瀨復費許多時間，使　儀承認渠訪問東京時，曾發表日滿親善聲明。溥儀辯稱：此種聲明係滿洲總務局）長所授意，非出本意。</p>

<h3>路局舞弊案　將有新開展　郁香嚴突然投案　昨解送地檢處連夜開庭偵訊　驚人之談　「陳局長曾索詐五百萬元警務處侵吞贓款七百萬」</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕兩月前，京滬區鐵路管理局材料處發生之一億二千萬元舞弊案，主犯材料處長張鴻圖及所屬職員十七人，即於六月廿五日下午被路局警務處逮捕，經偵訊之下，發覺張妻郁香嚴亦有重大嫌疑，但已潛匿無踪。乃由警務處通令所屬並分函本市各軍警機關會同緝拿，然迄今兩月，尙無影踪，一面由路局警務處即將所獲之一千人犯，移解地檢處偵査，但因該案牽涉商號甚多，偵訊麻煩，又因郁香嚴延遲尙未歸案，故偵査至今，尙未了結。</p>
<p>該案發生後，本報曾先後接獲郁香嚴之來函兩封，竭力為其夫辯護，口口聲聲指稱局長陳伯莊事先皆預聞其事，語氣之間，竟似指陳有通同舞弊之意，並稱彼本人正患病，候病稍愈，立即投案，請求依法查明眞相，免被誣吿云云，但該案發生至今，已有兩月餘，尙未見郁投案。而據本市偉光醫院院長李偉光吿本報記者稱：該都香嚴患毒癮甚深，每日需吸嗎啡五分，曾往該院戒毒，但案發後，即吿失踪云。</p>
<p>詎前晚十時，該失踪兩月之郁香嚴突吿出現，親自前往白利南路陳伯莊局長寓所，時陳局長尙在路局辦公未歸，當由其家屬電吿陳氏，陳聞訊即飭警務處派警前往將郁帶回路局，詳加問訊後，交警務處看守所扣押，至昨晚七時半，由警務處司法課長蔡振邦派員警四名將郁連同案卷移解地檢處，承辦該案之地檢處檢察官全匋，即於當晚九時開庭提訊，徑偵査一過，論令收押。</p>
<p>郁昨衣黑香雲紗旗袍，白襪黑緞　花鞋，精神尙佳，對記者稱：案發後即回松江養病，此次返滬已有二十多日，其問且曾與陳局長會談三次，至第三次廿五日晚，始被扣押。陳局長曾向張鴻圖索詐五百萬元，此事我有確實證據，將依法向法院提起控吿。而案發後，採購課長張伯康呈繳歸案之贓款法幣一千餘萬元，警務處僅解交法院三百萬元，其餘七百餘萬元皆已爲該處職員分用良吞云，該案日內地檢處將詳加偵訊，水落石出之日當在不遠。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕昨據怡和洋行負責人吿記者，貴生輪此次由港載救濟物品運往靑島·天津·灣滬兼裝客貨，到滬後即被中國航業界反對，曾代電海關禁止結關，當由該行於上星期六派員晋京，請求有關當局諒解，已得許可，惟祗准一次，下不爲例云。該輪聞定明午離滬北駛，嗣後外輪在滬裝運貨客，至南北洋口岸，恐已不可能。</p>

<h3>林康侯昨審結　定本月卅一日上午宣判</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕林康侯漢奸嫌疑案，昨日上午十一時半由高院開合議庭繼續審理，共歷一小時餘，已辯論終結，定本月卅一日上午宣判。按林當卅年太平洋戰起，香港淪陷後，在港爲敵俘虜，與李思浩等同被押解來滬，於卅二年出任僞全國商業統制會理事。卅三年聞蘭亭任僞商統會理事長，林兼任該會秘書長，同時出任僞上海市諮詢委員會委員，銀行業公會秘書長，僞市商會監事及美利化學廠董事長等職，據高檢處之起訴書稱，該廠以酒精資敵，日達一千加侖之鉅。</p>
<p>林昨衣　青　嘰上裝，灰色西褲，鼻架眼鏡，精神頗佳。供稱：服務社會已數十年，自問忠貞為國，米敢　節，香港淪陷後，出敵强迫押回上海，所任僞職中，僞商統會理事兼秘書長係以老友責格　助聞蘭亭處理事務，銀行公會秘書長職於戰前即已擔任，僞市政諮詢委員則由當時僞市長陳公　所指定，强迫擔任。至言美利化學廠資敵事，本人未詳，亦不能負責，因該廠之前身爲合羣酒精廠，廿八年改組成立爲美利，彼時本人在港，一切業務未詳，迨卅年押解來滬，始出任董事長，且亦非出於自願，於僞商統會任職期內，從未爲敵微集任何物資，反利用職權，搜集十萬餘件棉紗，於勝利後出呈政府。本人如欲做漢奸，當年不去香港，在僞府做個把市長還不容易？而廿九年被偽府之通緝，即可表明本人心跡云云。昨日之辯護律師爲江一平與傅况麟二人。</p>
<p>余華龍</p>
<p>僞上海市保甲自治籌備委員會副主任委員，現年五十三歲，奉化人，昨亦由合議庭審理。余供：當年因公共租界各處常發生炸彈案，敵偽時將出事地區封鎖，乃有保甲機構之設立，對就任事亦謂出於被迫，並謂此對市民亦殊稱便云。余華龍本爲律師，故昨在庭上，引用法律條文，竭力爲已辯護，請判無罪，該案亦定卅一日宣判。</p>

<h3>還是趁早改業罷「大班」請願失望</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市四十八舞廳奉令解雇之舞女「大班」二百餘人，昨晨十時分乘卡車四輛赴社會局勞工處謂願，趙處長以若輩旣非資方，又非勞方，寄生社會，對勞工處毫無關係，故拒絕接見。於是各「大班」推出代表八人，請見吳局長，因吳局長公出，由李副局長接見。代表所持理由，竟謂：「舞女大班之存在實對國家有益，蓋能推廣舞業，增加國家稅收。」又稱「制度不善儘可改良，根本取締，則絕人生計，故請社局轉請警局收回成命。」李副局長以其言不成理，而社局亦絕對贊同警局此項措施，故勸各「大班」從速改行轉業，如仍願服務舞塲，則須改換職務，此點社局當可召集舞廳當局勸予優先錄用，八代表見勢難挽回，乃快快辭出。</p>
<h3>軍事法庭庭長今日接篆視事　人事方面有調整　人事方面略有調整</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕劉世芳辭職出國以後，第一綏靖區軍事法庭長一職虛懸了將近兩月，雖然由陸起法官暫行代理，但是由於困難很多，軍事法庭的工作也差不多停頓了兩月。新任的庭長早已內定。由高等法院民庭庭長李良兼任，但是李庭長因爲民庭的事已經忙不過來，他又祖任着幾個大學的敎課，所以一直在懇辭中。最近終於因爲為李司令官的一再催請，他已決定勉爲其難的担任這個兼差，將於今日起正式接篆視事了。</p>
<p>他向記者一再的說，能力很薄弱，而且高院民庭的審案工作又差不多集中在他一人身上，現在分身出來兼任軍事法庭庭長，恐怕不容易辦得好，不過他說決定盡力做去。從九月一日起法庭將恢復全日辦公，那時候他預備上午在高院開庭，下午則臨軍事法庭。</p>
<p>關於人事調整方面，李庭長說原有的法官除了陸起留任外，瞿澤曾蔣保釐蔣保廉都已自請辭職。兩位檢察官中，林我鵬繼續工作，顧永泉亦已請辭，至於書記官差不多大部都已自行脫離更換了。現在除了派高院的推事張世傑兼任法官和他的得力部下李業初調任主任書記官外，其餘缺額的職位，要等綏靖區軍法處劉處長來滬商議後，才可以決定。</p>
<h3>黃香谷孫曜東各判徒刑七年</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕高院昨宣判漢奸嫌疑案五起：計僞社會簡易保險局局長黃香谷，與偽復興銀行總經理孫曜東，各處有期徒刑七年，褫　公權七年。密探黃截亭與鄭誠學，各處有期徒刑二年六月，褫奪公權三年。另郵差范日新，前被控代僞特工總部白俄籍密探道氏陶次兄弟傳遞消息，殺害我地下工作人員陳三才，經査無確實證據，故宣吿無罪。</p>
<h3>死無對證　哈同老工役　要求退職金</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕哈同洋行於民國三十三年四月起分批解雇之老工役五十九人，近向社會局勞工處申請調解，謂哈同及羅迦陵夫人逝世時，曾口頭遺囑，凡服務年久之老職工，退職時可照「慣例」分得五十萬元，照當時退職時之五十萬元，核計今日法幣應値七百四十四萬元，惟洋行當局僅允給退職金三月，合計不到念萬元。現社會局方面對口頭遺囑一點，以毫無根據，不能成立，唯各工役皆曾服務十年以上，一旦退職，似宜酌量給予退職金，退職金之數目正由社會局居間調解中。若雙方堅持，則社會回將予批駁，移交法院辦理。</p>
<h3>納粹間諜二十三名　歐哈德等昨日初審</h3>

<p>辯護席上除指定之　佑中校，及鮑定中校外，各被告自行聘請之律師有楊凜知，江一平，錢乃文，姚肇第，普萊母等五人。　首席檢察官奧康納中校宣讀起訴書後，庭上逐一詢問各犯是否自認有罪，自歐哈德起二十三名納粹戰犯均起立高聲答稱「無罪」。</p>
<p>庭上繼詢辯護人方面對於本案開審有無異議，首席辯護士勞佑中校起立稱：本案自提起公訴迄今日開庭，其間僅三星期之時間，被吿方面之準備工作實不够充份，故要求延期正式開庭。楊凜知律師則代表其當事人歐哈德，倫杜，海勃尼區等三人遞旱反對美軍法庭有權審判在華德人之抗議書，其中列舉理由十三點。經審判團退庭商議五分鐘後，主審官麥倫上校宣稱：關於抗議太庭審判櫃一節駁回，本案延期三星期，定於九月十六日再行開審。（左圖即受審之各犯）</p>
<h3>處分漢奸財產　包括原有在內</h3>
<p>關於徵治漢奸條例內沒收漢奸之財產一項，究竟沒收之範圍如何，敵產處理局因未得詳細規定。殊難辦理。該局頃接行政院轉咨司法院統一解釋法令會議決文稱：前所定沒收之財產，凡因犯漢奸罪所得之財物，及其他原有之財產均包括在內，不以因漢奸行爲所得者爲限。除其財物屬於公有者，應予追繳或應發還與被害人者外，均應予以沒收云。</p>

<p>「嘉我酒會」（本報攝）</p>
<h3>戴愛蓮表情深刻邊疆舞笑口常開</h3>
<p>〔本報特寫〕戴愛蓮舞蹈會，昨晚在逸園舉行。表演的節目，有「森林女鉀」，「拾穗女」，「思鄕曲」，「巴安孩子」，「春遊」，「傜人之鼓」，「嘉戎酒會」，「啞子背瘋」，「坎色爾韓」及「靑春舞曲」等，包括新疆·西康·西藏·四川等地邊疆最流行的士風舞。其中以「坎色爾韓」和「啞子背瘋」最爲精彩，也博得最多的掌聲。「坎色爾韓」是新疆大板城的一個姑娘和馬車夫的戀曲，舞式幽靜，表情深刻。「啞子背瘋」中所表演的，是一個鬍鬚長長的啞老頭子，背着一個瘋癱女（歡愛蓮飾），作種種動作表演。戴愛蓮在舞藝上的成就是不平凡的，一舞扇，一擊鼓，都是圓熟而美麗的，喜悅·恐懼。害羞。遙望。臨鏡·採花·擦汗·等等表情和動作，都叫人有親切的感覺。上海交響樂隊裏的音榮家個個笑口常開，坐在記者後排的工務局長趙祖康和他太太，不時連聲叫好。戴愛蓮的舞蹈會，沒有一巴蕾」（Ballet）的熱鬧，但是它比「巴蕾」更親切，沒有歌劇的悅耳，然而它比歌劇更有味。因爲它純粹是「我們自已的東西」。</p>
<p>會後，記者向戴女士作了一次比較詳細的訪問，據戴女士談；「我從小喜歡活動，五歲的時候就對舞蹈發生興趣，十二歲正式從師學習。這幾年在後方接觸到西南西北的邊疆民族，發現了極爲響富的土風舞材料，這些，土風舞多數是受過古代漢人的影響的，例如西藏的「跳鍋莊」和「跳茲子』，充分保持着唐代的遺風。從這些材料學習，希望在劇舞以外，創造一條中國民族形式舞蹈的逼　。</p>
<p>我離開英國快六年了，這六年中問，世界的舞蹈藝術天天在進步，自己關在後方這麽久，幾乎和整個舞蹈的世界脫節了。這次出國，第一當然要重新和這個圈子保持接觸，第二想把中國的民間舞蹈介紹到美國舞台上去。第三，英國時候的同學，有許多到了美國，而且已有極大的成就，急於要和他們見見。第四，十五年沒有回家，這次順便可以看看西印度的老父親。大槪一年以後回國，繼續硏究民間舞蹈。</p>

<h3>紡建未漲價　黑市昨復大跳　轉手獲鉅利申請如潮湧　望民營各廠採同一步驟</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日紗市，以各大紗廠缺少供售，益以上週日，中國紡　公司某負責人表示，將不顧社會抨擊，實行漲價，是以市場人心刺激，開　後，各檔棉紗，在一片買氣之　　下，直綫上翔，繼罘廿支紗，均軋漲十萬。卅二及四十二支，均軋漲廿萬。創匯率調整後之新紀錄。然午時紡建公司掛牌，照常配售，價亦罘懷，又聞申新紗廠，昨有雙馬，天女，紅人　，配售同行。雖照黑市略低，然與外　罘調整前之售價，已漲二成以上矣。</p>
<p>記者旋　訪紡建公司當局，査詢該公司配售情形，及對取締棉紗黑市猖獗之意見。據吿：　匯　調整後，各紗廠以所用原棉，大多取給外洋，成本不無提高。惟紡　當局，始終維持匯華調整前之原價配售，亦未變更配售量。惟上週　　率調整後，棉紗市價步漲，申請　購者，紛至沓來。申請數量，又異當龐大。紡建則仍照常的量配售。計上週一，三，五各日，每日配出各支棉紗，達二千件至三千件之間。以昨日情形言，申請　售者之單子，多至四千餘張。如以每張申請二十包計，即達八萬餘包之鉅。此項鉅額需要，顯屬不合　，以紡建配價言，現仍維持不變。如廿支藍鳳，每件配價為一百十六萬元。而昨日黑市價，爲一百五十萬元。四十二支藍鳳，每件配價爲一百九十萬元。而昨日黑市價，爲二百四十六萬元。領得配貨者，一轉手之間，即坐獲鉅利。故由請者接踵而來，紡建當局，以　國營事業，故仍苦心維持原價。甚望各民營紗廠，勿抱　望態度，努力與紡建合作，平抑鈔價。據估計：現本市紡建所屬之各廠，每日約可產紗六百餘件。而各民營紗廠之總產量，亦復相仿。故如能聯合一致，共同維持紗市，則黑市決不致猖獗至此。否則，單恃紡建獨力以低價維持，結果徒造成少數紗號獲利，而於於一般消費者，仍無實際補益云。</p>
<h3>王部長召紗廠代表　商計棉紗供應問題</h3>
<p>連日來紗布價格直綫上漲，中紡公司於前日舉行第八届董事會議時，對於中紡配售價格，是否加以調整而减低配價與黑市間之差額一事，各董事曾作極長時間之辯論，結果對於配價原則上不予變更，至　體辦法，則交田經濟部紡織事業管理委員會硏究決定，茲悉經濟部長王雲五除主持中紡董事曾外，昨日上午十時復花經濟部特派員辦公處舉行供應棉紗問題談話會，常時應召出席參加者，計有經濟部特派員張茲　，中紡公司副總經理吳味經，永安紗廠郭棣華。曲新紗廠榮鴻元，申九吳昆生，新裕童闊夫，曁王啓字等，由王部長主持，對於各紗廠供應棉紗數量及價格等，均有詳細之討論，希望各民營紗廠協助政府抑平棉紗價格。</p>

<p>布市續挺，且漲風愈熾，此因外埠實銷　展，而一半以現貨抽緊，市盤乃繼長增高，坯布·嗶賤·漲力頗盛，但紡建公司照例配售，然人心仍然熱烈，結果各檔布疋一致升二三千元，明日爲孔　，市塲停止　　云。</p>
<h3>浮多出籠　統債步降</h3>
<p>公價經各界對戰前債務發表意見後，種種奢望，復被冲淡，浮多　紛紛說手，統丙晨開承上週六餘風，哄高至二一〇〇元左右，不久即被出籌所壓迫，逐漸下降，中途低價邊至一六〇〇元，始　穩定，午刻在一六五〇元以上掙扎，結果較前收計甲乙丙各跌二　餘元，丁戊則降一八〇元</p>
<h3>金鈔升</h3>
<p>烚赤昨初學繼疲，逢高仍有壓力，不脫盤局，晨　因小銀樓抵補，扳高至二一七萬，開後即升至二一八萬　，始獲供源，而被迫下游，十時後偶至二一六萬，央行即以是價配給一五〇條，此後即吿呆霈，迄午刻仍在二一六萬五左右徘徊，午後廣帮稍納　略有　高，結果較上週六好起一萬，飾金紋銀俱平，銀元見秀，暗拆因月終將届，息價見昂，自一角二至一角半左右，業外更至一角八以上。</p>
<p>外幣平穩無變動，美鈔晨開時三四〇〇元至三四二〇元，開後微挫至三四〇〇元內，遂　平庸，迄午刻仍在三三九〇元左右掙扎，午後稍見起色，結果較上週六微升十元、港票平穩，終在七五〇元左右徘徊，結果較上週六秀起十元，港匯七五〇元有賣，美匯仍站牌價，英匯一二〇〇〇元，印匯九一〇元，亦均有　，惟買戶不感興奮，成交有限。</p>
<h3>茶市俏利　執貨者不肯脫手</h3>
<p>査紅綠茶內銷，除天津帮較形滯化外，其他各地依然　攘不絕，過程屹立殊堅，至於洋莊茶市，印莊注視趨緊之台　細紅茶，邇以到存兩涸，交易卒乏，惟目前同業問爲應急起見，特將郝門花香及粗紅茶暫代缺額，因故以上兩檔花色，連日交易頗旺，售價方面，亦若脫　之駒，他若福建紅茶，祁門紅茶，陳抽珍，陳針眉等，出　行家俱頻吸不懈，市氣火都跟踪飛颶，茲聞怡和協和兩洋行對於陳中祁門，頗有納胃，而每担如在十萬至十二萬元間，允爲歡迎，但近來執貨人心異常俏俐，不忍輕脫，咸懷觀望之態度。</p>

<h3>今日孔誕市場休業</h3>
<p>今日（廿七）爲孔子誕辰，本市工商業，自金融界起，各大市塲商店工廠，均照例休業一天，各機關亦均放假，惟郵局辦公鐘點，照星期日辦理云。</p>
<h3>新米來源漸旺　粳秈趨勢平和</h3>
<p>昨南北市到米登記約共四千餘石，均以新貨爲主，南京溧陽嘉興均有，浦東新粳，來源亦多，惟陳陳粳則寥寥無幾，白元亦少，故陳粳挺秀，新粳高俏次呆，白元奇貨可居，猛漲五六千元，秈米新陳均呈平和之勢，洋米配出，南北市計一萬七千餘包，麵粉廠方開出不多，零化甚股，供不數求，塲外價格見升一二百元，洋麵亦帶挺秀，麩皮鄉消蟬聯，小麥北方去化轉活，內地各路來貨見稀，閩甬亦有納胃，高貨上升五六百元，中下平正，黃豆來貨依然淡泊，去化亦懈，續跌二三千元，蠶豆高貨挺五六百元，生仁廣帮納胃尙可，步砌一二千元，油市來貨略稀，消胃活潑，形勢又趨供不應求之狀，價格上升一二千元，豆餅續小一二百元，天津餅小四五百元。</p>

<p>先後交貨計逾十三億元</p>
<p>前經政府當局訓令紡建公司撥付處理局接收之敵僞布匹，交由台灣貿易局轉換台省　煤，運交處理局，作易貨之舉，紡建公司自承辦以來，已交出布匹價値一〇億八二三二萬元，茲悉最近又交出布匹一三六件，計四五〇九九疋，包括漂府綢，斜紋，粗斜紋，玄色布及黃卡其等，共値二億四〇四六萬九千三百元，兩共計一三億二二七八萬九千三百元以上，末一批已由台灣貿易局駐滬辦事處陸續接收云。</p>

<h3>柏油漲風不衰</h3>
<p>柏袖各處存底均單薄，　之炎　未退，　　欠便，致來源日見减少　但製燭均將開洶。　用正繁，供求相差遠甚，浙油迭電報漲，昨據統兩，內坪油須十萬〇二三千元，變運　油九萬八千元，漢口報吿　城油有水氣之賓，須七萬四五千元，隨到　銷，毫無荐積，申市全靠兩處來源，旣如此缺貨，影響非輕，乃嘉興本車油　屬奇貨可居，聞產地已售至十一二萬元之外，本市各家批售禾本油十二萬八千元，內　油十一萬五千元，尖　　十一萬二元，的千油十一萬元，雙連蘭油十萬〇七八千元，麻城油十萬元，</p>
<h3>食糖軋缺續緊</h3>
<p>公會至今未開市</p>
<p>近日糠市以汕頭帮雖有續到，但貨未上棧，以致現貨依然軋缺，開價有緊無鬆，連日貢粉白開十六萬四千元至十五萬元？興赤寸四萬元，油赤十四萬五千元，　糖上週六爲十一萬五六千元，昨市復升五六千元，三二日內共成交六七百件，完全係行號聞直接交易，公會仍未開市。</p>
<h3>外匯調整以後　白桐油外銷漸通　惟來源稀少難於供應</h3>
<p>白桐油自外匯變更後，對外貿易確已可通，前日少數已有交易，計每磅美元三角三分，速桶送碼頭交貨，合市担在凈盤十一萬五千元之間，經此調整，此後或可源源出口，淮査各產地經過七八年兵燹，桐樹之損失，數實不少，產量已非戰前可比，且窮鄕僻壤，火油尙未達到之前，用以爲點燈之油者，數亦可觀，雖出口數量旣減而又滅，但產地亦無大量存積，菸價縱提高，而來源仍是稀　，出口雖通，供應上恐難暢達，亂後物產之凋弊，豈止桐油一物已也，申市各家批售內銷一例，足度每市担十一萬五千元，夏銷將次落令、祇零星點綴而已。</p>
<p>洪江桐油自白桐油漲後，將來成本當然增加，憔現値銷塲落令之時，不能據此類推，且存積頗厚，僅約略稍加，聊資附和，茲售各牌西副八萬五千元，</p>
<p>（又訊）倫敦桐油售價，用戶每噸出棧價格爲二百七十五英磅（佣金在內），較之以前二百三十餘磅，似已有提高，上述英磅價格，折合國幣每担爲十五萬五千三百七十五元，本市今日足度桐汕，仍少做開，買賣雙方，似仍存觀望心理，價格與上週六無變動。</p>
<h3>火油確已漲價了　汽油亦將隨漲油站諉稱售罄</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕匯率調整後，外來之火油汽油等液體燃料，成本亦吿提高。日來各加油站之汽油，雖仍維原價，即每加侖七五〇元。惟供售量，稍有限制，昨日有一部份油站，竟矮稱售完，不肯加油。至火油一項，各店門售每斤多自二百元漲至三百元。記者昨以此事詢　美孚洋行，據悉：該行出品廳牌新聽及散裝火油價格，自匯率謂　後，價格確略有更動。　牌新　每對（計兩聽共爲十加侖）之上海交貨價，原爲一三二五〇元，現爲二二一〇〇元，每加侖二二一〇元。又散裝火油每十加侖之浦東倉庫交貨價，原爲入八五〇元，現爲一四〇〇〇元，每加侖合一四〇〇元。汽油價格之調整，現正考慮中。據稱　各美商汽油公司，對火油汽油價格之調整，大致情形相仿云。</p>
<h3>出口稅豁免　天津豬鬃上漲</h3>
<p>〔天津廿五日電〕津市猪鬃輸出，前以品質過劣，致有一度停頓，後以紐約市塲，對我猪鬃需求尙殷，行情乃見活動，出口亦日見增多，自十九日政府發表豁免出口稅，並變更美匯比率後，猪鬃已吿上漲，且其成交甚盛，本月市價，改良五十五箱套貨，每斤一萬五千八百元，大五十箱套貨，每斤三萬五千二百元，四十三箱套貨，每斤一萬八千五百元，較五月前約漲百分之五十，今後仍有續升可能。</p>
<h3>證交開業期漸近　冷門股買氣大盛　對敲做至二十八日止</h3>
<p>華股因業中對敲號家，對便交實行做至二十八日止，多空籌碼勢必軋直，而帶恍惚，惟因證交不久復拍，來自冷股方面之重大助買力，不一而足，美亞爲狀依然堅挺，永紗有被動軋空之勢，是以初開時尙形平定，低價雖報低一二檔，但不易獲得，迄冷門開出即昂，人心被激重振，各股逐漸向榮，中途均現高價，而後轉盤，惟臨收低而復高，結果較前收計永紗美亞各升半成弱，景福平平，新光勤興微升，較冷各中型股升起一成弱，小型股則漲起一成至一成半不等，元老股亦好一成至二成不等，午收後，塲外水紗突起軋空，買一氣甚熾，喊價拔高至七三〇元。</p>
<p>外股仍由擇賤進取之西商投資，領導漲風，熱股相形失色，怡紗自八七〇〇元喊高至九三〇〇元，英聯九七〇〇元升至一〇四〇〇元，怡啤自二〇五〇元盤好至二二二五〇元，亞洲自一八〇〇元升至一九五〇元形勢堅俏異常，結果較上週六，計怡紗英聯業廣各升半成光景，會德　鋼業亞洲怡啤紙業各漲一成左右。</p>

<h3>鑽石旺銷　乃通貨膨脹之果</h3>
<p>〔聯合社凱普城廿五日電〕由於通貨膨脹之恐懼，以及美國傳來改變物價管制辦法之消息，南非之鑽石貿易，現又已大見興旺。鐵石出口者爲數甚多，因歐洲及美國人民恐通貨膨脹，幣値跌落，故多購買鑽石，作爲儲蓄，同時默洲及遠東之這難者，於返歸故鄕前，亦因未能換取大量外匯，多買鑽石携帶。</p>
<h3>鮮豬腸漲一倍　同業擬綂一收買</h3>

<h3>西安的八月</h3>
<p>— 廿二日西安航訊　特約記者李馳</p>
<p>當京滬要人穿梭於潯牯避暑地帶時，比問　已越過酷暑的最高頂點。今夏果然不出氣象專家所預料，因太陽黑子活躍，氣溫一般的較平年爲低。而牯嶺與京滬夏季氣溫差額，平均亦不過十度而已。</p>
<p>各大學投考者　總額將超出六千名</p>
<p>秋高氣爽，快到讀書的季節了。今年國立西北火學遷回西安，國立西北工學院亦有一部份分設市內（另一部份在成陽）故市內近來平添了許多應考者。此外中央大學，北洋大學，輔仁大學，蘭州大學等亦紛紛在陜招考新生。投考的機會儘管多，但依然容不下大羣大羣的投考者。早在去年此時，有些因戰時輟學的學生，就預料今年度的投考，必因人多額少，取錄機會困難。加以目下交通仍不暢通，許多本來想去平津京滬一帶就學的學生，也不能不變更計劃，暫時在此投考入學了。</p>
<p>照各校當局所發表的數字，投考者與取錄名額的比例，有些學院已達到一百比一以上，其困難情形可想而知。投考各火學的高中畢業生人數，佔計今秋超過六千人以上，而錄取名額總計不及一千人，其中還要留空幾及半額給復員的靑年軍。以西北晨學院爲例：投考生達二千多名，而名額不過二百六十名，其中尙需留給靑年軍的七十名，國立邊疆學院保送的二十各。</p>
<p>學生彷徨無路　教界籌設「夜大學」</p>
<p>毫無疑義，今秋將有數千名高中畢業生對各大學「望門興歎」。他們輟學的責任。應該完全由這羣不幸的靑年來負担嗎？不，當然不是，陝省支　部已去電中央及敎育部，請轉令西北各大學各學院，設法添設雙班，加倍錄取名額，謀取局部的補救。實際上，即使增加三倍名額，仍有「向隅」者。</p>
<p>另外一個有意義的提案，是計劃自陜敎廳長王友直和西大校長劉季洪兩氏。他們認爲許多靑年要兼顧到求學與就業，而「夜大學」的創設，必可爲無數苦學者解決難題。這所「夜大學」，將在西安設立，夜間授課，但學籍必須設法使各方承認，與一般白天上課的學校無異。</p>
<p>「西大」由城固遷回西安後，將使這古城的學術空氣增濃起來。在廣西，「西大」是廣西大學的簡稱，而在雲南，也有些人稱「西南聯大」爲「西火」，後者與這國立西北大學的前身「西北聯合大學」，正是戰時一對「姊妹大學」。西北大學時代只有文，理，法，商，三個學院，後來西北醫學院合併進來，從此有了四個學院。（過去一度還有過農學院和敎育學院，合共六個學院）。再査一査我國大學敎育史，二十年以前也有過一間「西北大學」，不過兩者之間，並無「血緣「上的關係。</p>
<p>「西大」的校址，在城南外不遠，大大小小一共有八百多幢建築物。過去是「戰幹團」借用了這墻址，在載時訓練出許多効會戰塲的靑年，　下該址還有少數　　駐都，資主之間，「相敬如賓」，部　在晚上有時演舊劇，放電影，學生們也跑過去「賞光」，「丘入」與「丘九」，簡直做兄弟一樣。</p>
<p>從小現門到校門一段路正設法翻修，將來並且預備行駛進城校車。入口處擬從新興建一座堂皇當應古色古香的校門，金色的字，浮　出校名，題發者爲于右任老先生。有人說，「西大」校門若然求不到于公的墨寳，担保再沒有別人敢動筆。</p>
<p>三三五新匯率　造成竌的悲喜劇</p>
<p>就算是一個完全與商業買賣無關的人也吧，不撥算盤珠而從另一個角度來看每天專給商人看的行情表，常常可以發現了最敏感的「新聞鼻」。</p>
<p>這幾天來，西安的市况顯然有些動盪了。原因大概有這幾個：</p>
<p>第一個，而且是最新鮮最刺激的一個，是政府宣佈了「三三五」新匯率。西安一般人是看到十九日早報才曉得有此新措施，但當天的報紙並沒有登載新匯率是多少，直到隔天（二十日）才見報。據說上海是當日上午十時發表，而此間有些「消息靈通人士」在十一時以前已從電波中獲悉。買賣如作戰，時間，時間，勝利屬於時間把握者。就在這先知與後知，後知與不知之間，我們看到了許多悲喜劇。據傳說，有些人在那一天內扒進了一個龐大數字，尾巴上帶了八九個「零」有得有失，不在話下。</p>
<p>這邊橋樑修好　那邊鐵軌却被拆除</p>
<p>第二個動盟了西安市塲的原因，是隴海鐵路除汴段之被共軍隔斷。共軍這方面的行動，其影響比諸侵人陝南那一路的來得大了。這月初因爲陜洛間的。第八號大橋已經修復，路局正準備月底先行實施陜洛直通車，其時經營運輸業的和一般商人，都予以莫大的期待。因爲這一條橋通車，西安與上海之間的鐵路遝輸，至此才算通達，對於運費當然可以較前大爲减省。數日前（隴海綫未漲票價前）按運輸行的訂價，由上海遝貨到鄭州，每公斤不過二百八十元，到洛陽，也不過三百五十元左右。以此推算，鐵路全綫，由滬直達西安以後，運費每公斤也不會超過五百元。這對於一般物價當然有好處。可惜，這邊橋修好了，而那邊的鐵軌却翻起，許多美麗的幻想破滅了。</p>
<p>年來此間由上海輸進來的百貨，愈來愈多，而今交通一斷，雖說存貨厚，但貨價目然隨漲了。受這方面影響的，有由上海來的布，棉織品，雜貨，化裝品，食料，紙烟，和經由上海轉口進來的一切洋貨。</p>
<p>第三個原因是隴海鐵路於十六日起調整票價，客票增加百分之七十，（較戰前已達一千三百多倍了！）貨票增加百分之三十。『羊毛出在羊身上」，運費加了，售價自然加。</p>
<p>努力調處成績　僅在泥濘中推汽車</p>
<p>第三十二執行小組，已於廿五日下午三時到達西安，他們一行六人是當天上午六時由龍駒寨乘坐汽車出發的。據他們說，自十六日到達了老河口以後，就曾極力設法想與李先念取得聯絡，駐在老河口的第九執行小組也同樣的努力設法過，包括用飛機投擲傳單和信件，都但至現在爲止，仍未有結果。第九小組定今天飛來西安。第三十二小組則等待第九小組到達後，合同集會，繼續調處，看情形如何，再定行止。</p>
<p>昨天下午第三十二小組，曾招待本市記者，發表談話，說明他們此行來陝，係由南京三人小祖授命，來調處豫鄂陝邊境的軍事衝突。並調處經過，歸向南京方面報吿覆命，美方代表白羅素上校用很幽默的口吻又說：『我們所努力的成績，不過曾獲到在泥濘中推之汽車吧了。』據說，他們在路中曾遇雨天路壞，汽車深陷泥沼，不能前進，他們祗好下車加油推動。白上校這句話，也許自有其言外之昔。</p>

<h3>寗波與慈谿的淡描</h3>
<p>— 廿二日寗波訊　特派員儲裕生</p>
<p>在餘姚，聽說四明山是盜匪的淵藪，我們就決定有四明山麓之行，早上七點鐘，乘大卡車出發到蜀山渡口的公路上，步行數十步，即至蜀山渡，那裏敵偽時期曾建有裘堡多個，這小小的渡口，戰時爲敵偽游擊隊新四軍進出的要道，眼見面前橫有一條大江，就是姚江，直通寗波，縱的也有一水名陸埠江，我們渡江至對岸，即為餘姚陸吞鄉地界，沿途阡陌連互，稻禾繁茂，樹木甚盛，農夫們趕着頭頭耕牛往田間工作，戽水的器具，在江岸邊鱗次櫛比，那耕牛都　是壯健而清潔，使人感着異常興奮。</p>
<p>我們循陸埠江前行，隔岸林木屏立，野花在江畔賣弄風姿，確是田間最幽美的風景。有幾頂轎子抬着人過去，這轎子異常完好，玻璃作窗，細籘作椅，我問轎夫因何有如此好的轎子？他說：「這是準備人家結婚用的。」足見當地人民的安適。我眞有些不信這裏爲盜匪出沒之區。</p>
<p>行十里而至陸埠鄕，這裘是四明山的門戶，就是四明山麓，四明山介於七縣，面積廣大，形勢雄偉，匪徒在山內爲非作歹，而且抱着「兎子不吃家邊草」的意旨，往往越蜀山渡而行却，所以陸埠與陸岙兩鄉，尙能平安無事聽說這些匪徒，在不行却時形同人民，故無法辨別，我們總以爲只有七分政治，三分軍事始能順利解決。只有使四明山的老百姓，感着我們的官兵可親可敬，始有淸鄕成功的一天。</p>
<p>復行十里，返至蜀山渡，再由蜀山渡至公路，驅車去慈谿，將抵慈谿城，便見一座塔，塔形甚似　峯塔，至縣城，城內有小馬路，俱以水門汀舖成，城廂遭敵破壞的程度較臨安武康等縣當爲輕微，惟市面冷淡，令人感覺戰後的元氣不易恢復全縣可耕種面積爲五土萬畝，人民戰前三十萬，戰後僅二十六萬人了。北部產棉較多，其餘多產稻榖。才華著名國內的陳布雷先生，歷史名家陳訓慈先生以及本報總編輯陳訓悆先生都是慈谿西鄉人。所以慈谿也可以說是人文薈萃。</p>
<p>在上海一帶走過的人，都知道航行的輪船公司有三北公司，所謂三北同，即慈谿之北，餘姚之北，鎮海之北之謂，已故之商業巨子虞洽卿先生即是「三北」人，這三縣的北端，却連接在一起，都近海洋，所以有單獨稱「三北」為地名的。</p>
<p>目前慈谿最嚴重的威脅，就是四明山的匪患，我聽很多當地父老說，如果四明山的匪不能澈底肅清，　谿總不想安寗了。</p>

<p>由慈谿出來，再驅車至寗波，一路平坦，車疾馳而到達目的也，這裏是遜淸道光年間被迫五口通商之地，城郊江北即是昔日的租界，爲英人所管，市內房屋，多爲現代化建築，馬路寬闊，而且有外難大馬路，中馬路，中山東路，東渡路等都以柏油作路面，着實有都會的形式。有人強調寗波爲現代都會，因其鄰接東海，至上海僅須十小時，有和豐紗廠，泰豐麵粉廠等七家大規模的工廠，小工廠紗廠等有三十餘家，行銷全國各地的油燜笋，即爲此處的如生廠出品，就是否國唯一大都會的上海與英美各國，喜愛吃油燜笋的亦復不少。論商業，有江厦街一帶的錢莊林立，銀樓衆多，北貨行亦復不少。寗式的木器亦極有名。寗漆尤爲中外所馳譽。</p>
<p>魚市一瞥</p>
<p>論漁業，這裏漁行有五十多家，現在改組爲魚市塲，並經中央規定上海爲第一魚市塲，寗波爲第二魚市塲，已把魚行改爲經紀人。維持貸款與卸買的關係，現在魚市塲辦理海產部與報關部，代理魚民報關等手續。不過漁民並不逕來求售，而是經過冰鮮船的收購，再求售於市塲，這裏不免有剝削的成份在內。况且魚市塲沒有冷藏間，全仗商辦的冷藏公司作冷藏，魚市塲不敢多收魚，漁船就送往冷藏公司，其間又有一層阻隔。至魚市塲的主辦者，爲官商各半，經費全靠漁行劃一部分爲塲用，鹹爲一分半，鮮爲二分，大致可以雜持而還有盈餘了。</p>
<p>教育實況</p>
<p>全縣戰前人口有七十多萬，現在僅五十萬，全縣面積爲五十五萬一千一百四十七方里，可拱面積爲二百〇六萬六千七百九十九畝。境內有效實中學一所，分高初中部，爲陳布雷先生所創辦，學生七百餘人，投考大學無有不取，故著名於寗屬一帶，另有縣立鄞縣中學，省立寗波中學，浙東中學，甬江女中等均爲完全中學，每校都有五百人以上的學生，又有　南初中，正始初中，縣左右的學生。校舍很好，設備亦全，以上？都可以說明是够條件，充實健全的一個縣份。所以在民十五十六兩年，曾設立爲市，後因省政經費困難，改市爲縣，惟警察局尙直隸省府。</p>
<p>境內東區有東錢湖，廣三萬八千三百二十畝，爲鄞縣，奉化，鎭海三縣農田水利主要的源流，受益田畝五十二萬七千餘畝。環湖皆山，風景綺麗，湖水澄淸，村落處處，不過近年多已汙塞，蘆草叢生，呈荒蕪之象。</p>
<p>復興寧波</p>
<p>實在講，近年來的寗波確遠不如前了。工業因爲成本過高，不是關閉的也改小了規模，商業因爲外貨的傾銷，購買力的减低，也現着極度的不景氣，寗波後市的公娼。原有頭二三等之分，頭等有三十二家，二等十八家，三等十七家，頭等的有九十四人，二等的有三十五人，三等的有二十三人，現在亦比例的增加了。</p>
<p>博物館與圖書館也已毁壞無存，公私學校的校舍毁損的也很多很多，乞丐與游民充斥市上。</p>
<p>復興寗波，自在省政當局與縣府地方人士籌劃企求之中，當前最重要的課題，在經濟方面，應該發展魚市塲，再改良加工製造油燜笋和漆，興修東錢湖的水利也是當務之急。在精神方面，應該多多提倡學術性的文化運動，改良社會的風氣。八。二十二日於寗波</p>

<h3>怎樣選擇一個　好丈夫</h3>
<p>— 鄒當昌</p>
<p>是個青年，她〔或他〕總有一個理想，一個甜蜜的理想。理想她戀愛的甜蜜，理想她婚後生活的適宜，和諧。但是當她一且身歷其境的時候，擺在面前的總是事實。事實並不像理想的那樣好，於是自殺，憂鬱成疾，種種的弊病來了。其實這是最愚笨的，你因爲有太好的理想就經不起意外的打擊了，其實你何必如此！你只要認定了目標，不爲環境所化，不爲阻礙所屈，那麼你認定你心中的配偶的條件，你決不會失敗的。下面有幾個條件，希望你能確實的去想想：</p>
<p>一·認淸結婚的目的。我們第一要知道的結婚並非爲性慾的滿足，但許多人却犯這毛病·他們多半以爲一個女子結了婚，就好像一件事已經做成功，以後只要放在那裏，當着一件看的或玩的東西·這是要不得的一種思想。</p>
<p>二·對方與你的興趣同吾？我們能見到一位非常活動的男子却和一位沉默的女子結了婚，男子喜動，口若懸河，一開口就住不了，他的興趣是多方面的；但是那位小姐往往一二小時會悶坐那裏而不說一句話，於是他倆的後果可想而知·在戀愛的時期，一方面或許會屈就的，但是一且結婚之後，你要向東，我却要向西，於是裂痕日深，惑情日壞，後果眞不堪言。例外是極少數的</p>
<p>三·你在男朋友當中選據你永久的伴侶，你要注意對方的年紀，他的年紀最好能大於你四五歲，因爲女子是非常容易見老的·當一個女子生下了第一個孩子時，你能發現她無形之中老了許多，同時我們也能見到男女二人同是四十歲，他倆站在一起，一定是女的老。於是他們一同出去的時候，他往往覺得有點不相稱了，所以當你擇友的時候切需注意到此點。</p>
<p>四·在男女交友的時期，大冢決不肯拿出本來面目的，脾氣好的男子當然不必說，就是脾氣極壞及反臉不認人的男子，那時他也決不會有如何粗魯的表現，他會裝作和顏悅色，無微不至的奉承你，你要是一不當心，便墮入他的圈套，你將後悔也來不及了。所以，你和他交朋友的時間越長越好，因爲時間一長，兩人一熱，那麽各人易於現出原形來，於是你能確定他的脾氣如何。我們時常見到一對男女，在戀愛時期，他是百般的溫存，但是一到婚後，對妻子可能拳足交加，百般辱駡了。</p>
<p>五。訂婚與結婚間的時期，是比較甜蜜的時期，但是最好你能在一年半載就行結婚，當你訂婚之後，切不可遷延歲月，虛耗你的靑春時期。因爲女子靑春一過，就不易吸引男子了。同時我也看到許多訂婚的情人，在訂婚之後，兩人分離，於是男子另有所戀，美滿的因緣爲第三者所破壞了，因爲男子是比較容易變心的。當然結婚之後男子變心也極普通，但是你要知道，婚後你們總不願久別，而且他到底多了一種障礙，在法律上離婚是比解約更煩難的。</p>

<h3>檸檬蛋糕</h3>
<p>— 墨萍</p>
<p>讓我來介紹一種精美的點心，檸檬蛋糕。現在我把它的製法，寫在下面。</p>
<p>原料：麵粉四兩，芹菜粉一兩半，糖四兩，雞蛋二枚，削皮檸檬果半枚。</p>
<p>製法：先將蛋敲破入碗中，用筷調勻。另以大磁盆盛麵粉，將蛋倒入磁盆，加芹菜粉，糖，及剝皮檸檬菓半個（菓須搗成粉狀），以手用力拌勻，拌畢取起，仍置於平板上或桌面上，捺成大餅形。再放於鍋中蒸之，約一點之久，可起鍋。另將烘樣器厚抹牛乳油，架於火爐上，候鐵板稍熱，即將蒸熟之糕，置之烘糕器上，覆一洋鐵薄蓋，約烘至三十分鐘，糕中所含之蒸氣，可乾一半。啓蓋視之，其在底半段，麵粉已乾鬆；近蓋處半段，必濕而黏手。另取烘糕鐵板一塊，塗牛油一過，作蓋覆糕上。（不用洋鐵薄蓋）二手持上下二鐵板，將糕翻　再烘，至半點點鐘久，糕中濕蒸氣全滅，則糕乾鬆發香，可將糕連鐵板取起安放。待其冷透，用刀切成方塊，其味甜美可口，旣鬆又香，最宜饋禮。</p>
<h3>少女交友須知</h3>
<p>— 愛娟</p>
<p>（一）保持自己的尊嚴，不可有輕佻的態度，尤其是對於初交不熟的異性。</p>
<p>（二）初交的異性竟然寫來肉麻的情書，的妳看電影，逛舞塲，這種人必是存心不良，應特別加以留心，必要時毅然對其絕交。</p>
<p>（三）應有反臉不認人的勇氣，以對付心懷惡意，行爲不檢的追逐者。對於男友的要求應詳加考慮，也要有拒絕他，不怕得罪他勇氣，吾則，一味應許，結果他曾一步進一步的使你落入他的圈套。</p>
<p>（四）切莫和生活浪漫，行爲放蕩的同性及異性朋友結交。近朱者赤，近墨者黑，如果自己墮落失足，身敗名裂，那時就後悔不及了。</p>
<p>（五）路上及娛樂塲中，像瘋狗一般追逐的頭光鞋亮者，大半是「抖亂」「拆白」之流，切不可以加以理睬。他們的目的，很顯明的是在欺弄女性。若是比較文雅地上前請敎姓名，以便開始接談的人，也不一定是君子。總之，陌不相識者切勿加以理睬。</p>
<p>（六）男性求交少女的心理，都是借交友之名，行談愛之賣，沒有一個是僅想得友誼而已。因此，在交友之初，就應當開始考察對方的性情，品行，學識，假使覺得對方不合標準，而對方却熱烈的向自己表示着愛。那，你該表明自已的眞意，使他斷絕此念。而僅與自已保持着友誼。</p>
<p>（七）已經熱戀着或是訂過婚的少女，若與別的異性朋友出遊，當在三人以上，同時最好內中一人是同性，這樣旣可避去有關係人們的物議，也免得引起愛人的猜疑所發生的悲劇。</p>
<p>（八）不要完全拋開父母，秘密地交友。更其是戀愛的對方，至少該讓父母認識，同時就當聽取父母對他的批評，以作自己的參考。</p>

<h3>「一！二！三！」的妙用</h3>
<p>— 淸</p>
<p>前兩天，我在姨父家裏，看到了一摏布奇的事情，就是在五表弟和六表弟兩個吵得很厲害的時候，突然他們二哥跑了來，嘴裏彷彿念咒似的，喊了兩聲「一…二…」，馬上兩個小孩就住了嘴，一聲不響地—雖然還努着嘴—走開去。後來我爲了要明瞭這件事，特爲去問姨父是什麼道理？承蒙他不嫌麻煩，源源本木的吿訴了我，我聽了後，覺得姨父的這個辦法，直是一個美妙的兒童敎育方法，因而不敢自私，寫出來獻給本欄的讀者，以作參考。這下面便是姨父的談話。</p>
<p>在一羣小孩子—尤其是十歲以內的—正在嬉戲得興高采烈的時候，假如你要忽然停止他們的活動，眞不是一件容易的事，除非用惡聲或怒駡，甚而用責打方能生效，但是惡聲，怒駡和責打，都是兒童敎育家所不許，而且又確長有碍小孩子身心的發展的。</p>
<p>我記得在十四五年前吧，那時我的大女兒不過十一二歲，有一天，四個孩子在玩着一稱捉人的遊戲，從樓上奔到樓下，由院子跑到室裏，正好那時我也在做文章，不能不停止他們的遊戲；於是我便和顏悅色的叫他們停止，可是他們給我一個不理不睬，當時我原想用恐嚇手段或是駡他們一塲，但是，見了那些天眞爛漫的小面孔和快活的小眼睛，我又不忍過於嚴厲，結果我還是低聲下氣的，叫他們過來聽我講話。</p>
<p>就在他們走過來的一霎那，我發明了我的兒童敎育方法，我對他們的法三章，並且和靄的說道；「現在我要寫文章，可是你們又吵得太厲害，所以我惟有這個辦法，先讓你們再盡心的玩一下，等到玩到差不多，我再高喊『一』，這時候你們還可以不睬我，不過等到我喊出『二』，你們可是一定要準備停止，若是喊了『三』，你們不停止，那末我就要怪你們而責罰你們了。知道嗎？」大概是爲了新奇的緣故，他們不的而同舉起小手表示贊成，於是我照辦法實行了，大的過了十幾分鐘，我說聲「一」，他們果然眞個不睬，我有點懷疑了。幸而過了七八分鐘，我再喊「二」，他們都眞的不動了，一律停止遊戲了。</p>
<p>從此以後，這個「一！二！三！」就成功了我的家法，後來我有了六個孩子，我便把這個滑稽的家法，當着六個孩子的面，予以這種權力與我的大女兒和次兒子，要他們四個弟妹都尊重這種號令。</p>
<p>對於這件事，我覺得很足以自傲，因爲我的道個方法，從來沒有不靈騐過一决，每次他們都在我未喊「三！」之前，就一律停止了運動—所謂運動包括了打架，吵駡，胡鬧……種種情形。而且，這種號令祗有由我指給任何一人，才會發生效力。記得有一次，一個朋友要試騐我的說話，他也來一個「一！二！三！」的號令，結果他們非但不睬他，反而嘩笑他；可是等我正式宣布道位朋友也其有同樣的權力，他們纔服服貼貼的邀守，這也是我的法時所顧慮到的，恐怕別人濫用來遏止了小孩子的天眞呢。</p>

<h3>崩潰（小說）</h3>
<p>— 楊謀</p>
<p>亭子間裏顯得非常的沉默和靜寂。</p>
<p>後弄裹響着鄰居們的高談闊論，男女間的調侃，孩子的笑鬧，也有人在哼着流行歌曲，………，顯着與房間裏的空氣非常不調和。</p>
<p>這是一間三層樓的亭子間，陳奮和狹窄，滿屋裏大半堆滿着塵埃的陳讓的傢具。伴着一盞十五支光黯慘的燈光，主人，三十歲模樣，架着玳　的眼鏡，平頂頭，圓蛋臉，滿臉好像罩滿了生活的奔波的申生赤着膊正在批改着文卷。</p>
<p>儘是一隻手不停的揮着芭蕉扇，但是再也遏不住不斷滲出的汗珠。</p>
<p>望着桌上一大堆的大考卷，申生不禁微微的噓了一口氣：</p>
<p>「這生活」，有一點怨懣。</p>
<p>腦海中憧憬起一個個坐汽車，住洋房了的發了財的朋友同學們來。</p>
<p>無意識地，他放下了筆。仰起了頭，望着印滿了黃色的水漬的天花板，羨慕，妬意，一齊涌了上來。</p>
<p>用牙齒哎緊着唇皮，他努力克制着自己。年輕的，活潑的，一個個學生的臉，他想了起來，他忙又拾起了他的筆。</p>
<p>「申生，申生。』</p>
<p>後門上一陣急促的擂打，高聲的呼喊。</p>
<p>聲音好像有點顫抖，使申生非常陌生，再也辨不出是誰在這樣的匆忙。</p>
<p>剛站起了身，可巧後門呀的開了，大概是底層的房東太太吧，接着是一陣急促的樓梯聲。</p>
<p>「咦，是你」。</p>
<p>申生再也料不到站在面前的，這樣慌亂的人物，便是蘭鈞。</p>
<p>道是上海市塲中一個相當活絡的人物，年輕，手面闊，雪亮的頭髮，筆挺的白西裝，但是，今晚上却失態的踧踖不安。</p>
<p>二隻手向外一攤，聳了一下肩，蘭鈞苦笑地坐在床沿上。</p>
<p>「申生，我是來向你吿別的。」</p>
<p>申生再也想不出這究竟是一件什麽事情。他呆楞地望着蘭鈞，也回不出一句話來。</p>
<p>「也吧，我也沒有什麽事情了，我可以慢慢地談一會。這一次，公債上面，連家庭，名譽，一起都捲去了，現在，喏，就只剩我一個人，外面計不淸的債務一。</p>
<p>申生開始瞭然起來。</p>
<p>申生和蘭鈞，是同鄉，從小就極要好的朋友。他們二人剛從鄕間的初中畢了業，烽火就把他們拖進了時代的漩渦。</p>
<p>從故鄕輾轉逃難到上海，他們倆仍舊是志同道合的朋友。不過，在事業的起點上，爲了環境，興趣的差異，他們慢慢地分了手。</p>
<p>申生苦撑起進了中學，進了大學，蘭鈞却進了火車站在敵人的卵翼下做着黑帽子。</p>
<p>申生勸吿過蘭鈞，但是，這不是說的問題，這是眞實的力量的考騐。除了這樣的一途，蘭鈞自己，蘭鈞的家庭，都沒有生存的餘地，在脆弱的意志下，蘭鈞默默地進去了。</p>
<p>當申生讀完了大學，苦歏着沒有出路，充着一所私立中學裏的敎師的時候，蘭鈞已經脫離了黑帽子的生涯，專門做着囤貨的生涯，積資已經相當地可觀了。</p>
<p>「關鈞，這總不是辦法，你得爲你前途打算呢！」</p>
<p>曾經幾决三番，由生向蘭鈞這樣地勸吿。</p>
<p>「我也這麽想，但是，天亮了再講吧，現在，除了這樣，有什麽辦法呢！」</p>
<p>蘭鈞總　樣回答。</p>
<p>不過，蘭鈞奢侈的生活，曾經也引起過申生暗暗的羨慕，雖然蘭鈞要帮助他的時候，他總是拒絕。</p>
<p>「申生，你放心吧，我也受過敎育，對於太非分的事情，我也不會做的。</p>
<p>這是蘭鈞常安慰申生的一句話。是的，他，一個年輕的孩子，剛只受初中的敎育，要肩起了家庭的重担，又怎能去苛求呢？</p>
<p>勝利了，申生熱烈地和蘭鈞握手，他們依然可以向一條路綫進行了。</p>
<p>蘭鈞也很興奮，他找到了一所技術的事科學校，他安整好了家庭，他虔誠也想讀幾年書，來補償他生命上不可磨滅的缺陷。</p>
<p>後來，蘭鈞却退學了，好像只進去了一個月吧。他依然去做他的生意去了。</p>
<p>申生問過蘭鈞，可牛　沒有回答。</p>
<p>最後迸出了一句：</p>
<p>「像你這樣用功，又怎樣呢！」</p>
<p>這話裏當然含有他多少的失望的，由生一句話也回答不出來</p>
<p>以後，聽說蘭鈞更活躍闊綽起來，汽車，洋房，等等。</p>
<p>不過，蘭鈞甲生，比較生疏起來。</p>
<p>一個生活在富裕中，一個生活在貧窮中。</p>
<p>他們還是朋友，他們相互地同情，他們相互地羨慕，他們相互地關切。</p>
<p>申生明白蘭鈞已經從天堂一直往下跌倒地獄去了。他同情他的遭遇，但是可也想不出辦法。</p>
<p>「你自已還不歇……」</p>
<p>申生想責備，但是看到他失神的神態，不覺浮起一陣憐憫。</p>
<p>「我知道，我知道，但是，戰爭期中社會上混了這麽多的時候，又怎樣能再去跟年輕的學生們一起唸書？只一個月，我太受不了，我走了出來。我想找事做，找一個好好的，但是，結果還只是這個。唉，我自己……」</p>
<p>一片陳訴，是的，一片陳訴</p>
<p>「現在怎麽辦呢」？</p>
<p>「什麽都沒有了。家裏的人都送回了鄕，房子傢具都賣了，就只剩我自己。以後，上海也住不下了，不知道再闖到什麼地方去」。</p>
<p>「太快了」。申生不自覺地嘆着。</p>
<p>「是的，太快了，自已種的果子總是有收穫的。幾年來，我常痴笑你，現在我才曉得你的生命，你的工作，是長久和永恒。</p>
<p>「不，不，不，……」</p>
<p>申生很窘，情感很亂。</p>
<p>蘭鈞已經站了起來，緊握着申生的手。</p>
<p>「申生，我們也許會再見，也許永遠不會再見，我永遠感謝你過去給我的關心，我也永遠羨慕你的生活！我走了，走了」。</p>
<p>手一鬆，他走了，順手將亭子間門一拉，一陣急促的樓梯聲，申生也忘記了相送。</p>
<p>他看見一個人影，好像漸漸地淡淡和遠去。</p>
<p>他頽然地倒在牀上，一個朋友，他不禁爲他祝福。</p>
<h3>麗園之遊</h3>
<p>— 中原</p>
<p>大家都說　　的玫瑰好　，可是秀明約着我一同到那裏去玩的一天，沒想到正値暴雨颶風之後，攻　已經統統凋謝了。</p>
<p>在一座荒涼的小茅亭旁邊，　明找到了一條比較光滑乾浮的石凳，把我輕輕往上回一推，自己挨着我身邊坐下，說道：「我本來不是想約你來看什麽玫瑰，不過是想找個機會和你談談。」</p>
<p>秀明說得很輕，那溫柔巾略帶剛毅的聲音，還是像九年前一樣的淸脆悅耳。她的一條長長的手臂搭在我的肩胛上，幾根纖綫的手指，在玩弄我頸邊的頭髮。她又繼續低低的說下去：「我要吿訴你一些我的痛苦，這半年來蘊伏在我心中的痛苦。……』</p>
<p>「你痛古？」我問</p>
<p>「是的，我痛苦。……她答。</p>
<p>我希奇地旋轉頭去看看秀明的臉孔，那張尖尖的臉孔，還是像當年一樣的淸秀美麗。我又看了看她的一隻垂在我肩頭的左手，那隻可愛的小手，也和當年沒有什麽兩樣。不過現在，在那第四個指頭上，多了一個小小的白金鑽戒，這是九年以前所沒有的。</p>
<p>難道她的婚姻有什麽不滿意？</p>
<p>我實在想不出什麽理由敢這樣懷疑。這麽一位才貌雙全的小姐，大學畢業，經歷過千山萬水，遊偏了半個中國。又曾在槍林彈雨之中，烈火濃烟之下，爲祖國出過力，効過勞。最後，憑着她銳厲無比的眼光，在一本厚厚的追求者的名册中，選中了一位多才多情多錢，而又極有地位的佳婿，難這會有什麽不滿意？</p>
<p>不會的！我心裏這樣想，嘴裘就這樣向她說：</p>
<p>「聽說你的生活極幸福！」</p>
<p>「幸福確是幸福，但是！」</p>
<p>說到這裏，秀明的眼睛忽然奇怪地一轉，轉出二這可怕的亮光，這亮光裏，含有悲哀，怨恨，憤怒，咒詛，……</p>
<p>「不瞞你說吧，我是上了一個大當，原來他在淪陷區早有了……」她忽然又轉變了話鋒，對我古怪地一笑：「不過現在，他已和那女人離了婚！」</p>
<p>「離了婚不是很好嗎？你還有什麽痛苦？」我說。</p>
<p>「但是雖離了媚，那個可惡的女子，却陰魂不散呢！」</p>
<p>「怎麽陰魂不散？」</p>
<p>「她到東到西跟住我們，我們到上海，她也到上海，我們到南京，她也到南京，現在我們回鄕來過夏，她又來了。而且那女人，年紀雖也很輕，却像瘋婆子一樣，每次碰到我們，總是痴痴地看着，不理她也是看，對她白眼也是看，駡她也是看，簡直看得人毫無辦法，……』</p>
<p>秀明滔滔地說下去，我靜靜地聽下去，天色晚下來了，我有些咳，秀明才停住了話，說：「你吃力了，回去吧。」</p>
<p>我確乎有些吃力，不過怕冷淡了久別重逢的老友，離開麗園之前，我陪着她在裏面盪了一個圈子。她又說了許多那女人的話，但是我沒有聽進去，我只默默地注視着一朶朶被颶風暴雨摧殘的玫瑰，心中感到難過。</p>
<p>走出麗國，秀明的我過一天再來談談，我沒有答應。她問我爲什麽，我說：「我怕看見那些可憐的玫瑰！」</p>
<p>我的確不想再遊麗園了，甚至我也不想再看見那個美麗可愛的朋友。</p>
<h3>高原女神（世界名畫選載）</h3>
<p>— 福斯作（一八六八—一九〇四）</p>
<p>藏倫敦泰德美術館</p>
<p>福斯（C.W.　Furse）生於史丹尼城，早年即習畫，惟體質甚弱，求學時即已多病，後終於三十六歲時即吿逝世。「高原女神」一畫，係繪其妻玉立風中，畫面充滿一種空曠的安寗氣氛。</p>
<h3>離不開上海</h3>
<p>— 謝紫</p>
<p>最近碰到一個朋友，他說他心境非常不好，自從父喪以來，因爲有些家務事要料理，一個多月沒有出門，一不出門，人就彷彿待定了，他本來難得在家的，這次却一直在家裏待了兩個多月，足不逾戶，家務的繁瑣使他難堪，母親無論什麼事都找着和他商量，一家人的目光都集中在他身上，希望他有個辦法，而他却毫無辦法，對於任何事都提不起興緻來，就是女朋友來看他，他也漢然無所感覺，彷彿是忘了愛，不曾愛了，他的苦悶是多方面的，而那一方面都得不到解決，他吿訴我他最近的起居情况：早晨十一點多鐘才起來，梳洗一審，已經是吃中飯的時候了，有時候起得更晚，人家叫他吃飯，他說你們先吃吧，等他弄好之後，再把小菜搬到屋裏來，自斟自酌，吃完飯以後，隨便看看報，却從不看書，有時候朋友來看他——不是旁的朋友，而是住在隣近無事可做的朋友，就天南地北的聊夭到四五點鐘的時候，也許去買點酒來，弄幾樣小菜，一吃就可以吃上三四個鐘頭，朋友走了以後就撥開無綫電來聽播音，從流行歌曲到新聞報吿，京戲，越劇，以至大鼓灘簧，無所不聽，只要是連續的聲音，只要要是使他忘掉自己的一切聲音，一直聽下去，聽到晚上兩點多鐘，一天就算是打發了，這樣日復一日，他感到萬分苦悶，却又無可奈何，家庭對於他，就好像是一個悶的魔窟。</p>
<p>我說：「假如你到遠處去旅行一次，也許對於身心都有很好的影響」。</p>
<p>他說：「我正是這樣想，假如帶一個親密點的女友，到靑島去渡過這個夏天，該是多幸福的事，早晨一早起來到海濱去呼吸新鮮空氣，或者說去呼吸點黎明世界的朝氣，我始終以爲靑島有一種詩的情調，游泳我也喜歡，我可以在清涼的海水中一洗塵濁，晚上到舞塲裏去聽音樂，那輕柔的樂曲和着海濱的潮　。一定是格外可愛的……樣我身體可以慢慢的好起來，心情也就慢慢的規律了，可是我沒有充分的錢，也沒有這樣身份，這只是一種癡想」。</p>
<p>「那麽到你的老家蘇州去也好，總比待在這兒强點」。</p>
<p>「蘇州嗎」？他苦笑着看說，「想起蘇州來我就頭痛，看來看去，永遠是那麼個小圈子，要玩也沒有地方去玩，要談話也沒有談話的對手，晚上一到八點鐘，整個蘇州就闃然無聲了，我還是比較喜歡夜晚，可是大家都睡了，你一個人不睡，就是發出點聲音來，也使人驚訝。總之，在蘇州，就是找尋麻醉，都沒有地方去找」。</p>
<p>從他的話裏可以看出來，他一面憧憬着一個遼遠空闊的世界一而還不免眷戀着上海，眷戀着這兒的繁華，眷戀着這兒聲色味的享受，他雖然咀咒上海，說是在這兒待得不舒服，而實際上，他的咀咒，就像一個母親斥責她的孩子一樣，心裏還是愛他的，他對於靑島的憧憬，，也只是一種遼遠空闊的憧憬，他沒有想到那是多麽的渺渺茫茫。</p>
<p>除了道地的市儈以外，沒有人能完全滿足於都市，除了道地的鄉下人以外，也沒有人能够毫無眷戀，離開它的我們生活於都市中，浸染於都市中，往往只看到它煩惱的一面，而忘記了它的可愛處，一旦想着要離開它，它的可愛之點就全部暴露了，假如我們到鄉下去，第一感到不便的，電燈和自來水都沒有，走出門去一看，道路崎嶇，滿目荒凉，更覺得不舒服，這還是最簡單的，我們在日常生活上不免處處感到逼仄，因爲凡是人類都有着好羣的傾向，對於塵整　華的愛戀，對於眩耀的人類文明的趨附，也是我們的本性之一，離開了都市，就彷彿離開了人類，那種寂寞荒凉的感覺，在我們心裏造成了委曲，我記得有一個日本人說過，「我捨不得離開上海，我捨不得上海的女人，」這不是一句單純的俏皮話，而實是出自眞心的，然而我們還是憧憬着一切遠的地方，因爲遠，所以模糊，所以完美，彷彿只要走到遠的地方，一切事都可以解決，一切事都可以撇開似的。而實際呢，靑島不見得比蘇州好，蘇州也是有名的天堂，然而他體騐了蘇州的生活，因而失掉了憧憬，失掉了憧憬，蘇州的神秘也就失掉了，假如他一向生長在北方，他也許正會撞憬着這江南柔媚的水鄉，有如他現在憧憬青島那樣，可是一旦達到了目的，一切又全不是那回事了。</p>
<p>這種對於遼遠空闊的憧憬，可以說是一種詩的素質，對於現實的不滿，它是動盪血不安定的，彷彿是翱翔空由的巨鷹，假如一個人作一次週遊世界的旅行，也許每一個地方都很可愛，要叫他一直待下去，則任何地方都不會完美，他不願爲物質的洪流所掩沒，因爲他有一個翱翔的靈魂，然而他也不能捨棄都市的繁華，因爲他是熱情的</p>
<p>「我想你還是在這兒待下去吧。」我說，「有機會作一决旅行，像你這樣的人，我也是一樣，我們是離不開上海的。」</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風　15</p>
<p>「啊—呃！」一種奇醜可厭的傳呼聲，叫人聽了，感覺到到神經麻震。站在我身邊這個財迷傢伙，向北邊山坡下的另一哨位，高聲傳呼，打着手勢，想是知道他的身份解決不了我們的問題，所以找人來，伴送我們去見長官。</p>
<p>「一〇六師團，平坂部隊，一三一聯隊，第三小隊，一等兵××」我早把他們的番號看明了。我記得早幾天，這個部隊還在國內集合之中哩。可是現在已經到了這裏行動了。</p>
<p>所謂長官，是個小隊副隊長。上海人開口駡人是「猪玀」，在我的想像之中，這個猪玀應該是額角低陷，鼻孔揪天，下顎突出，以致嘴唇包不住大粒的門牙，一見就可以想到「張牙舞爪」的姿態。如其猪獨是這副生像，這位副隊長，恰巧合着這個標準猪獨的模子，祇多了兩粒大金牙，發出刺目的黃光來。</p>
<p>「閣下服務的機關，是應當首先請敎一番的，很對不起的失禮了。」</p>
<p>也不知爲了什麽因由，我忽然想到在上海大舞台　過「猪八戒招親」，那個新郞；不也是扭扭揑揑地學着人樣，弄兩句三不像的修辭談吐？</p>
<p>我們計劃着不肯利用小鐵路，或軍用汽車直上北平，就是要維持不給任何方面知道我們的來踪去跡。吾則我們早已抵達北平了；因爲大陸參謀總部的牌子，很可以向任何方面請求便利的交通。</p>
<p>「應用第十五號方式罷！」我心下早打定了主意：</p>
<p>「機關是大日本帝國陸軍省參謀本部皇軍大陸作戰部參謀總部；職位是參謀總部特務工作少校級特務專員××××；此行是軍事秘密，不可能奉吿，失禮了。」</p>
<p>對一個起碼軍官說話，眼睛應該望着天空，或是天花板。這是「翻眼不認人」的作風，這時候我始終維持着這個作風—虛僞，傲慢，狡詐，詭譎，桀驚，以及誇大的瘋狂作風。</p>
<p>酒，有長辛店白乾，日本正宗，上海「必魯」；餚；鷄，鴨，聽子沙丁；以及北平香瓜，山楂糖等。誰也不知道這種李受，是打那裏來，如何方式弄來，雖然僅僅一個小聯隊。</p>
<p>這時我惟有耐着性子，消受他的供奉。小老虎是以「滿洲國」　陽特工名義的掩護，很痛快而同時又很機警的狼吞虎嚥着。從這孩子的眼風上，可以看得出兩點；他並不是沒看出倭鬼對於他如此饕餮，恨得牙癢癢地，祇是無法攔阻；所以樂得吃個痛快，同時也表示「吃這王八蛋的，活該你肉痛，誰叫你招惹老子？」</p>
<p>幾番吿訴這位猪玀，有要緊公事，必須趕到城裏；而他的理由，却碍難　倒；</p>
<p>「回專員的話，假使您沒有駕臨到小人棚帳裹來，步行走去，也得深夜才能進到城裏。這裏照公路走，先得到大灰塲，五六公里，大灰廠跨永定河到田村約十一二公里，再到西直門，又有近十公里。小路更是難走。不如一到天黑，—行動更自由—由部下用自働車，沿我軍防線內走到離城最近據點，一共祇要一二小時，就可到達城廂了」。又把地圖展開，證明他的打算高明，雖然已經醉到九成九了。</p>
<p>上車的時候，我背着兩個駕車的日本勤務和那猪獨副隊長，對小老虎打了一個緊急警吿暗號，是聰明的孩子看得懂的手勢。開，我和小老虎坐在車廂內；那個醉猪獨坐在前面，和駕車的在一起。走了不到一里路，那傢伙忽然吩咐停車，下車向我吿罪，要求坐到後廂裏來，說是可以保護得更周密。</p>

<h3>畢勛路慘案</h3>
<p>— 少夫</p>
<p>請市政府答復</p>
<p>上海人有一句流行的駡人語，叫「屈死」，其意與「瘟生」相彷彿，照字面上解釋，寃屈而死，或委屈而死，自然都有「不値得」「無妄」的酒義，有點惋惜和同情；不過在通常使用這一句駡人語時，往往却具有責備對方死有餘　或活該你倒霉的憤激之情。</p>
<p>「屈死」一的最初來源，由於機動車輛的肇禍事件，其後乃　假而成爲車輪下寃魂的專有名詞矣。當時租界中的會審公　，對於違反交通規章以致罹難的行八，毫無哀矜之意，處分原則，僅僅司機罰鍰數十元而已。這一辦法是對的，可以令行人警惕於都市交通的規章，別在馬路上任意所之，而不守公衆秩序；但也有流弊，容易養成司機的驕縱，草菅人命，不過花幾個錢。所以後來就有馬路如虎口的傳說。</p>
<p>可是在今日，在上海的市街上，不僅不諳交通規章的外鄉人，舉步維艱，即連我們恪遵市政府行路須知的市民，一樣有隨時化爲屈死的機會，人人談虎色變，視外出爲長途，這一嚴重現象，市政府如果不念謀解救之道，爲了生命安全，四百七十萬人無法諒解市政府的。</p>
<p>遠的不去說，昨天，就發生荒謬絕倫最慘痛的一幕——前上海市黨部委員張詠春烈士的妻兒，在畢勛路人行道上，被美軍醫院的軍醫車輾斃，並不是因爲死者是市立小學的校長，是前上海市黨部委員張詠春烈士的家屬，我們才特別重視此事，而是因爲死者在人行道上遇難，而是因爲最近層出不窮的發生這一類汽車肇禍案，我們沒有汽車的小市民沒有辦法不，每天出外作升斗之謀、我們的生命安全太沒有保障了，我們隨時有被殺的可能，我們不甘願這樣糊里糊塗的屈死，我們請求市玫府給我們保障！</p>
<p>畢勛路慘案要給我們一個交代！</p>
<p>除此之外，我們要問</p>
<p>一，駕駛執照如何發給的，駕駛人管理規則如何，軍卓有沒有駕駛執照，駕駛人受不受管理？</p>
<p>二，行駛的汽車數量，有沒有一個限制的標準，是不是可以無限制的增加，有無顧及道路面積？</p>
<p>三，有沒有研究軍車行駛市區辦法？</p>
<p>四，市政府府對於目前交通情况滿意嗎？（汽車隨便停放，紅綠燈關啓之沒有標準，……）</p>
<p>關於交通問題，我們一再曉舌，實情非得已；我們也深知市政府的努力和困難，但在不能達到安全與便利的程度前，請原諒我們決不放棄對於這個問題　哆：</p>
<h3>創立教師節的目標：（一）改善待遇，（二）保障地位，（三）增進修養。</h3>
<p>— 征凡</p>
<p>我先吿訴你「敎師節」的產生，那是在民國二十年，是年六月六日，京滬三百餘敎師，爲謀鞏固地位，改進待遇，暨努力修養起見，相約而萃於中央大學，舉行會議，經一致同意，決定每年的是日爲「敎師節」。直到民國廿八年八月十五日，行政院四二七决會議始決定改每年八月二十七日孔子誕辰爲敎師節，理由是「冀於兆民康樂之中，深寓景仰至聖之意。」</p>
<p>由此可見創立敎師節的目標；一是改善敎師待遇，一一是保障敎師地位；三是增進敎師修養。</p>
<p>敎師節到今日已是十六屆了，這三個目標究竟達到了沒有？</p>
<p>先說敎師的待遇。敎師待遇的菲薄，原是「自古已然，」而於今允甚。「改善待過」的呼聲　了十六年，而敎師所得的薪水一年一年的減少下去。你是知道今日上海一般小學敎師的待遇的，但你還有知道內地的鄕村敎師任過着怎樣的生活。鄉村的小學敎師，目下拿二萬元一月的薪水，還得要拖延上三個月。戰前敎育經費佔預算的百分之二十，而喊了無數　「敎育第一」的今天，敎育經費却跌到了僅佔預算的百分之四·七，敎師生活不安定，什麽「建國以敎育爲先」的話，都是「徒託空言！」</p>
<p>南京有位敎員，窮得連衣服都沒有穿，穿了太太的旗袍上課，晚上當苦力，來補助家庭開支。各地傳聞着敎員爲生活壓迫而全家自縊的新聞。上海曾有某校教師，偷了同事一筆錢，逃到杭州西湖邊花天酒地的玩了一陣。然後自殺。今日報章上觸目都是敎師們的呼　，每個角落裏都有着教師們的嘆息，呻吟！，這是不是算得國家的恥辱？</p>
<p>再說保障敎師地位，更是令人感慨系之！今日敎師的地位，全不關學識的淵博，經驗的　富，完全視學生的好惡，校長的黜涉，與同事們黨同伐異爲進退。甚至於今日堂堂國立×大，校長亦任意解聘敎可職員，我們尚有何話可說？而社會上對一般「任重道遠」的敎師們，旣不「尊師」，又不「重道」，過去像「蘇益之事件」等已够說明了。敎師們受着雙重的輕視，還說什麽「保障地位」呢？</p>
<p>敎師的修養，可不用提。今日敎師待遇，上不足以仰父母，下不足以俯　　　　「　　齒豁，竟死何裨」？有　路的，都不甘「老死　下」，紛紛改行，剩下了一批無路可走的敎匠還在迫不得已的貓跳狗叫，添了一批資歷淺薄的新敎師在那裏濫竽充數。鄉村小學中，高小畢業的亦當小學敎師，初中肄業的在當中學敎師，成績如何，可想而知。荘子說：「用志不紛，乃凝　神」，一般敎師，柴米油　等逼得你頭昏腦漲，還要你什麽「磨厲淬　」呀，「努力進修」呀，「什麼什慶」呀，也　是「憂憂乎其難矣哉」了。</p>
<p>不久前，報上戲某校校長强姦女學生的新聞，實在使我們無話可說，中國師資水準的普遍低洛，果不待言；但假使通敎師本身的品行人格也崩潰了時，其後果豈忍設想？</p>
<p>好了，牢騷似乎已經發完，我最後仍得讚據敎師畢竟是偉大。英國H.G.Wells說：「敎師是歷更眞實的創造者，統治者。政客與我們時代的民衆不過是他們幼年教育的傀儡。」教師們，萬歲！萬歲！</p>
<p>我　兩句教師歌：「教師　我、立　處世；敎師待　，如子如女。」</p>
<h3>上海教師待遇</h3>
<p>— 保羅</p>
<p>本市敎職員的待遇，可以分爲市立，私立兩種。</p>
<p>市立學校的敎戰員，待遇和公務員相同：底薪照加三百八十倍之外，另有生活津貼一律八萬元，如果以平均底薪百元計算，每名市校敎師，一月所得爲法幣十一萬八千。</p>
<p>私立學校教職員，按照敎育局的法令、把所收的學雜費，以百分之三十作學校開支，百分之七十作教員薪俸。所以私校敎職員的待過參差不一，須視所收壓費的高低，學生人數多寡而定。他們的薪俸也有超過市校敎師的，但是大冬數還是比不上市校敎員的待遇。</p>
<p>市立學校的經費，由敎育局核發，而私立學校一向是財政獨立的，所以他們爲了提高敎師待遇，應付艱難的生活，祗有增加學費一個辦法。</p>
<h3>也談溥儀</h3>
<p>— 其鹿</p>
<p>皇帝運　傀儡命</p>
<p>溥儀在東京國際法庭上作證，被被吿的辯護律師反詰的時候，所回答的是左一個不知，右一個不曉。的確像　儀這樣的身不由己的傀儡皇帝，能知什麼，能曉什麽？</p>
<p>溥儀沒有做過皇太子，他的父親載　不是皇帝。因爲載湉（光緒皇帝）死了，沒有兒子，皇族中才把他的姪子溥儀繼承了皇帝的寳座。其時溥儀還祗二歲、便被稱爲宣統皇帝了。三歲做皇帝，不是傀儡是什麼呢？</p>
<p>溥儀三歲交進了皇帝運之後，到了第三年上便逢着辛亥革命。那時候的傀儡牽綫人總算乘巧，和革命軍開了和議，得以享受民國的優待，在皇宮裏溥儀還算是個皇帝，不過星宮也受了限制，小朝廷裹的大臣不能再從南向的天安門進出，只能從北向的地安門出入了。這好比上海的小人家—後門出入—了。</p>
<p>民國六年辮子大師張勳鬧復辟，要把溥儀抬出來，沒有成事。張勳逃進了荷蘭使館，溥儀還是安坐在後門進出的皇宮裏。直到民國卞三年馮玉祥回師北京對溥儀下了遂客令，逼他出了宮，同時廢止了淸室優待條例。從此大家想，溥儀的皇帝運該是走盡了。那知道到了民國二十年九一八之後，溥儀在天津被日本人土肥原弄到了大連，下一年往長春做了「滿洲國」的執政，後來改爲「皇帝」。宣統皇帝變做「康　皇帝」，溥儀又交進了十三年的皇帝運，直到民國卅四年八月裏被蘇聯空軍在瀋陽飛機塲捉着，做了俘虜。大概這一回他的皇帝運一定盡了。再不然，這世界的歷史是倒轉而不是前進了。</p>
<p>溥儀在吃奶時候做淸朝的皇帝固然是名符其實的傀儡，到了成年之後做「滿洲國」的皇帝，也還是個傀儡。在民國十年前後正當溥儀進入一生的靑年時期，他受了五四運動後的新文化的影響，曾經請胡適進宮去討敎，曾經鬧過要婚姻自主。他的婚姻結果還是不能自主，他能自主的是在那時候剪掉了自己的一根髮辮。這是他任人擺佈的一世傀儡生活中唯一的自覺行動了。</p>
<p>溥儀木來是清朝的末一個皇帝。淸朝的皇宮就是明朝的皇宮，後門正對着明朝末一個皇帝崇禎自殺地點的煤山（亦稱景山）。不知道溥儀對於崇禎帝殺了兒女又自己上吊的時候說的，「願生生世世勿生帝皇家」的憤慨話作何感想？</p>
<h3>呌化子要錢</h3>
<p>— 楊慰</p>
<p>上海馬路上叫化子很多，有些年紀很輕，照樣拿了洋鐵罐頭「釘鈀」；如果不給他們錢的話，就會牢釘不走，而且出言不遜，他們的伶俐的口齒和高度的忍耐力·實在令人佩服！讀者中有遇對類似下列的情形嗎？</p>
<p>「老　，開開金龍手，年紀活到九十九。」</p>
<p>「　沒，　沒。」</p>
<p>「老閣，明　去，暗中來，一鈿勿洛　空地。」</p>
<p>「掉頭，掉頭。」</p>
<p>「老閣，惻隱之心，人皆有之，　救　　三。」</p>
<p>「去，去，去！」</p>
<p>「老闆，窮　富，富　天·今天　我大餅鈿，明年保險開大店。」</p>
<p>「跑，跑，跑！」</p>
<p>「兒孫自有兒孫福，莫為兒孫作牛馬，老　請　隨使施捨點。」</p>
<p>「滾蛋，滾蛋！」</p>
<p>「赤老，儂倒底撥哦？」</p>
<p>「駡人，定規勿撥。」</p>
<p>「猪　，狗皮倒灶，勒煞吊死，限睛一閉，一點　　，　絡　　買棺材　罷。」</p>
<h3>教育界憾事</h3>
<p>— 征凡</p>
<p>時事雜感</p>
<p>還是一貫的中國官塲習氣：</p>
<p>前幾日報載：×立××大學新任校長×××氏——按：該×××者，即開汽車闖禍逃走而被警副局長追　之敎育家也。——接任以後，對原有教職員一百六十餘人中·使續聘三十八人。敎授等以×氏無故解聘，咸表憤慨，正在交涉中云。</p>
<p>解聘教員的事，在上海各衖堂學店中，原是數見不鮮，無足爲奇；但竟發生在被譽爲「××最高學府」的堂堂×立大學中，就不得不使我們覺到奇怪。×大敎授的資歷　　，早爲海內听稱道。抗戰期間，校遷閩北建陽，敎職員們拋家離親，努力本位，也因爲他們苦幹的精神，才造成×大一部光榮的歷史！而今日這羣「勞苦功高」的敎職員們，却因爲調了校長而被摒於校門之外！</p>
<p>據說，×氏也有他的「理由」的。他的理由是：他曾經和×前校長在一次不公開的談話中，×氏曾說：「一部分同人預備聘到英大去帮忙，一部分同人已經另有高就，一部分同人服務不力，一部分同人無法安插，……理由甚多，不及細載。所以×氏爲尊重前校長×氏意見，便對道些人不擬予續聘。</p>
<p>總之一句話，一百多位敎員的解聘，完全由於前任校長×××的授意。好在×氏已死，樂得推在死人身上，表示與自家毫沒干係。</p>
<p>但是，敎職員們旣非奴隸，又非商品，爲什麽在一次「不公開的談話」中，（假定×氏說的是實話。）任意可以擺佈支配呢？所提各點，是否有充裕的證據和理由？</p>
<p>×大的敎職員們在呼　着：</p>
<p>「天知道，復員以後，繼以裁員；樂業的美夢未成，失業的威脅踵至、國家民族方呼吸着自由的空氣，我們却被人當作奴隸貨物似的，任意支配，任意擺佈；我們不知×氏具何心眼，竟使出這在學校聘任史上空前也許絕後的摧殘手段！」</p>
<p>今日適逢「教師節，」×大的教師們，却正在黑暗中掙扎。</p>
<p>這委實是敎育界的一大憾事！</p>
<h3>小菜場上</h3>
<p>— 金經</p>
<p>我是八口之家的一個主婦，當然要天天上菜場買菜，舟山路的方型二層樓的菜塲，規模的確相當不錯，魚肉蝦蟹，大牢少牢，山珍海味，應有盡有。</p>
<p>因爲購買力差，每天提着籃子，總是巡廻在蔬菜集中的一隅，無非買些富於營養而價格較　的菜蔬，以適合「蔬糲亦足飽我飢」的物質條件。</p>
<p>世風日下，人心不古，竟影　到菜塲中的買賣，拈斤駁兩，論多計少的應有爭執之外，還增加了搶一把，撈一把的陋規，有時竟會有買得少撈得多的事實。</p>
<p>我絕對不願意公然盜賊地搶些撈些，以增加我所應得的量質，可是無論靑菜，豆牙，總比隔壁娘姨大姐所買的同樣物品，同樣價格，要少得多。</p>
<p>這個疑問，承一個熟悉菜塲情形者解釋，才知道菜販因爲抵抗買主的搶撈陋習，所以把買主的額外需索，早早預算在成本上內，不向他搶撈的主顧，反而是優瓜·這個陋習，已成了公開的秘密，不明瞭的，恐怕是絕無僅有。</p>
<p>我不忍公然盜　，我亦不能不上菜場　，但永遠以過多數代價買過少蔬菜，似乎也是受累無窮，我希望毀滅陋習！</p>

<h3>風雲人物：狄托元帥</h3>
<p>— 桂庭</p>
<p>南斯拉夫的獨裁者（下）</p>
<p>南斯拉失國裏的政治團體除了狄托的共產黨外還有三個：密克海洛雜基的赤尼克黨，墨索里尼支持的恐怖團體，烏斯泰奇，和尼的基將軍所組織的傀儡政府。狄托的共產黨游擊　是拼足性命和它們競爭奪取政權的。不久，密克海洛維基和狄托互相交　起來。狄托詆毀他的政敵是和納粹合作的。直至最近，居然以通敵叛國的罪名把密克海洛維基槍決了。</p>
<p>一切仿效蘇聯</p>
<p>狄托獲得了蘇聯的支特之後，他的勢力即蒸蒸日上。所有部馬一舉一動完全模倣蘇聯。軍隊以緊握拳頭爲禮，後來英國使節團到達後，便於一九四三年十二月裏被廢止了。人民代表到處皆是，據說是執行着傳播政治敎育的使命。所用的國旗是紅星旗。大家互稱爲同志。傳單上總是印着狄托和斯達林擺在一起的照片·他們也有秘密密察組織，名叫做OZNA，是模倣着蘇聯的NKVD和OGPU而　立的。</p>
<p>一九四三年間英美爲了避免與盟邦蘇聯衝突的　故，於是放棄了密克海洛維基而開始擁　狄托·英美的供贗品也源源接濟到狄托的游擊隊去，因此他們也英獎式配備起來·靑年男女一個個都參加狄托所領導的游擊隊·他的軍裏大約百分之廿五是女人·體格魁梧的村女和男人一起戰·共膳共　·但並無性的泯　現象發生，因為狄托是鼓勵着犯姦者槍斃的信條的。</p>
<p>狄托的手下大的百分之七十是廿五歲以下的小夥子。多數中將階級的軍官是的模三十歲左右的。狄托也組　了靑年團。參加的團員是歇私的里亞地發動擁護狄托的運動·他們的頭腦裏日以繼夜地被灌輸以刺激的口號如：「自由！」「從法西斯的壓迫下解放出來！」等。他們就喃喃有詞地回答：「狄—托—狄—托—狄—托！」簡直像鐘擺一樣。他們不大用頭腦來分析事物，他們都相信他們是爲「民主」而奮鬥，因爲他們的元帥吿訴他們這樣做的。</p>
<p>狄托所倡黨綱</p>
<p>狄托所領導的民族解放前綫是號召着下面的黨綱：（一）建立民族平等的南斯拉夫聯邦，（二）維護民主權利自由，（三）觀私人財產的不可侵犯性。（四）決不發動革命的經濟的或社會的改革。表面上講起來是相當漂亮的，但南斯拉夫在狄托的治理下，整個經濟社會組織却逐漸地蘇維埃化起來·在狄托的手令下，南國人民日夜都　　着「蘇聯偉大」「蘇聯光榮」的思想·他們有一次竟然指着在天空翱翔的三百架B十七型的飛機，大聲嚷道二「這是偉大的蘇聯空軍啊！」</p>
<p>最近南美交惡的局面正顯示着：南斯拉夫或者會成爲將來世界動亂的根源地。看吧！南國的西面是一條綿長的海岸錢，滿佈着港口，足以收容全世界的海軍，而它的東面是虎視眈　地雄踞着的蘇聯，那個缺乏出口的大陸國家·在當中呢，却坐着一個活力滿身的曾任蘇聯共產黨專員，狄托。</p>
<p>世界似乎還是站在火山爆發的邊　，狄托會首先　天下之不題來放一把野火嗎？</p>

<h3>Communist Forces in Northern Jiangsu Suddenly Attack Taixing; National Army Rushes to Reinforce and Contain Them; Communist Side Continues to Breach Dikes to Salvage a Desperate Situation</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Zhenjiang, 26th] According to an urgent report from Yangzhou at 9:30 PM tonight: There has been a significant change in the Northern Jiangsu war situation today. To salvage the deteriorating situation in Shaobo, the Communist forces suddenly launched a fierce offensive north of Taixing. The focus of the war has shifted from left to right. Three regiments of Communist troops launched a surprise attack on Huangqiao and Danjingzhen yesterday. The National Army's forces in the area were weak, and the situation in the two Taixing areas was extremely tense for a time. After fierce fighting until noon today, the National Army reinforcements arrived and contained the Communist offensive. However, the Communist forces have a large number of follow-up troops and plan to continue to attack the two Taixing areas, further threatening Yangtze River traffic.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Zhenjiang, 26th] According to a phone call from the Xiannvmiao front line at 8:00 PM tonight, since the National Army entered Dawangmiao along the Grand Canal line, the morale of the Communist forces has greatly declined. They even breached the Grand Canal dike at the Liuwufang Hotel south of Shaobo. The Chaiba area has been flooded, and the breach is more than two feet wide. Fortunately, the Grand Canal water level has been low recently, otherwise a major flood would have occurred. Furthermore, the National Army braved a hail of bullets this morning to forcibly cross the Shajiangba pontoon bridge on the Xianshao Highway. The first and second lines of Communist defenses in Shaobo are extremely strong. In addition, the area is surrounded by water on three sides, forming a natural defensive position for us. As of the time of this dispatch, both sides are engaged in heavy shelling in Shaobo Town.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Taixian, 26th] Since the recapture of Qiaoshu on the western front, the Communist forces entrenched in Dinggou, Shaobo, have shown signs of wavering. The National Army is now approaching the outskirts of Shaobo, engaging in fierce fighting with the Communist forces. The 12th Regiment of the Communist forces near Rugao to the west has been suppressed by our troops moving north from Nantong in continuous suppression operations. Seven regiments have been routed, two regiments have surrendered, and the remaining three regiments have retreated north. The 24th Regiment of Communist forces in the Jialifenjie area southwest of Rugao has also been routed. In addition, more than 20,000 Communist troops with Japanese-style equipment have been transferred from Yancheng to Dongtai, but their intentions are unclear.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Zhenjiang, 26th] According to official sources, the Communist forces in northern Jiangsu have been silent for a long time after their defeat in Rugao. Recently, on the 24th of this month, they suddenly gathered a mob of about seven regiments and attempted a pincer movement on Baipu. Commander Liu, the garrison commander in the area, keenly learned of the situation and immediately led part of his troops in a counterattack. The two sides engaged in fierce fighting under heavy artillery fire for two days and nights. Until 4:00 PM on the 25th, the Communist forces were unable to hold out and fled in disarray. We captured a large number of prisoners.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Jiangdu, 26th] Military news indicates that the Communist forces in Northern Jiangsu are continuing to dig dikes to offset their military setbacks. According to a recent survey, the situation in the flooded areas is as follows: (1) Eight breaches have been dug in the dikes of the branch rivers of the Wanbei Canal, flooding the northeast area. (2) The road southeast of Zhaodun has been destroyed by the Communist forces, and fortifications have been built on the dikes of the small rivers. A large breach, 1,400 meters long, has been dug in the river dike southeast of Zhaodun, flooding many villages. Further south, five breaches have been dug in the small river dikes, and a large breach has been dug in the small dike at the Sancha River estuary. (3) The flooding is severe along the city river south of Pixian to the Liujiadu crossing. (4) Six breaches have been dug in the dikes along the river north of Donghai City, and the floodwaters are rushing from east to south, turning the fields into a vast expanse of water, causing severe flooding. (5) In the Yinfanghang Shayuba area in the western Yanhai River area of Guanyun, the Communist forces have dug 22 breaches. The water is rushing, deep, and voluminous, submerging trees and houses.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 26th] The military recently seized Communist documents, including a diary of a Communist cadre, stating that they were ordered to concentrate in Southern Shandong to support the Communist forces in Northern Jiangsu to carry out a protracted war, and were prepared to break into small groups to carry out a comprehensive destruction of transportation if necessary.</p>
<h3>Comforting the Soldiers in Northern Jiangsu; Eagerly Distributing This Newspaper for Reading</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Zhenjiang, 26th] People from all walks of life in Jiangdu today brought a large number of comfort items, including 10,000 packs of cigarettes, towels, and canned food, to the front lines to comfort the National Army. This newspaper's reporter felt that the soldiers on the front lines lacked spiritual sustenance, so he brought 200 copies of this newspaper to the front lines to distribute to the soldiers, which greatly boosted their morale.</p>
<h3>Communist Forces in Southern Shandong Defeated</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 26th] Military news: (1) In order to coordinate with their new offensive in Northern Jiangsu, the Communist forces continued to attack the National Army outside Xuzhou from the areas of Taierzhuang, Fengxian, and Zaozhuang in Southern Shandong, and gathered a large force on the north bank of the Grand Canal to build a pontoon bridge. Part of their forces that crossed the river has been annihilated by the National Army. Currently, the National Army is confronting the Communist forces across the river along the Chenzhuang and Dawangmiao line on the south bank of the Grand Canal. (2) The Communist forces invading Hanzhuang have been routed by the National Army's counterattack and have been fleeing towards Fengxian since yesterday.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 26th] Military news indicates that the Communist forces in Suining attempted to attack west again. On the 25th, they launched a full-scale attack on the National Army along the Xiajiamiao, Tudangzi, and Daliiji line. After the National Army launched a counterattack in multiple directions, the Communist forces were routed by the morning of the 26th and seized the opportunity to advance and occupy Guanshanji (12 kilometers southwest of Qiaoning), Taoyuan (14 kilometers southwest of Suining), and Longji (12 kilometers north of Suining).</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Kaifeng, 26th] The Longhai Railway is actively repairing materials east of the Tianxinglong Station and can now reach Luowang. The section from Luowang to Lanfeng can also be repaired within a few days.</p>

<p>[Special Dispatch from Tianjin, 25th] Huo County in the southern section of the Tongpu Railway has also been captured by the Communist forces after the fall of Hongdong and Zhaocheng. The fighting near Ceshi on the Zhengtai Railway is also fierce. On the 23rd, four regiments of Communist forces launched a major attack on the North and South Hill positions. The South Hill position was lost and recaptured nearly ten times, but the Communist forces ultimately failed to capture it.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Datong, 26th] Military news indicates that the battle for control of the outskirts of Datong is still raging. 7,000 Communist troops north of the city concentrated their firepower to attack the National Army defending the railway station. The National Army firmly defended the bunkers, while the Communist forces surrounded them. They even broke in at one point, making the situation extremely serious. After the National Army reinforcements counterattacked, fierce fighting lasted all day, and the Communist forces suffered heavy casualties and fled in disarray. In addition, the Communist forces attacking the military repair factory, alcohol company, flour company, and other strongholds have lost their edge due to continuous unsuccessful attacks, and their offensive has been thwarted. They are now holding their positions and waiting for reinforcements to prepare for another attack.</p>
<h3>Laohekou Agreement Expires; Communist Side Expresses Disagreement</h3>

<h3>Communist Party's Statement on the Current Situation; Zhou Enlai Formally Issues It in Nanjing Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 26th] The Communist Party delegation hosted a reception for the press community at 3:30 PM on the 26th, presided over by Zhou Enlai. At the reception, they distributed a summary of the Xinhua News Agency's "Masses" Weekly editorial "Immediately and Unconditionally Ceasefire and Implement the Resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference" as the Communist Party's formal statement on the current situation. The statement stated: An article was published in the "Masses" published in Shanghai on August 25, targeting Chairman Chiang's August 14 message, entitled "Immediately and Unconditionally Ceasefire and Implement the Resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference." We believe that Chairman Chiang's message "not only failed to change this situation, but also worsened it," "because the ceasefire conditions he proposed were that the Communist troops withdraw from many areas and the local elected governments be abolished, and that the one-party government of the Kuomintang take over." The editorial pointed out how the government authorities overturned the ceasefire, the PCC's military reorganization and other agreements, such as "after the announcement of the January ceasefire agreement, the government side never implemented the ceasefire in the Northeast, did not accept General Marshall's proposal and the Communist Party's immediate endorsement of sending an Executive Headquarters group to the Northeast. Later, although there was an agreement on March 27 to allow the dispatch of a group to the Northeast, the government side then violated the agreement, refused to cease fire, and fought fiercely in the Northeast. Until the June truce, the offensive in the Northeast slightly eased, but the offensive within Shanhaiguan spread throughout the north and south of the Yellow River. The Kuomintang government has so far occupied 59 county towns and more than 3,000 villages in our liberated areas."</p>
<p>In the June ceasefire negotiations, in order to strive to achieve the desire for peace, the Communist Party has not hesitated to make major concessions in the supplementary agreements on the ceasefire in the Northeast, the restoration of transportation, and military reorganization. "However, during the negotiations, the government authorities unreasonably raised the issue of the final decision by the American side... when the agreement was about to be reached, the government suddenly demanded that the Communist troops and local elected governments must withdraw from Northern Jiangsu, the Jiaoji Railway line, the area south of Chengde in Rehe, and Andong. Otherwise, the four agreements cannot be signed, and a ceasefire will be difficult to achieve." The Communist Party "believes that the troop stations for the implementation of the military reorganization plan must not be confused with local administration, and the issue of local power has been clearly stipulated in the appendix to the PCC program, so it firmly rejects this demand that exceeds the items of the ceasefire negotiations." At the beginning of August, the five demands raised by the government authorities through Ambassador Stuart became more and more numerous, and the authorities regarded the current "demands as a prerequisite for a comprehensive ceasefire and negotiations on government reorganization." "The government not only broke the agreements on the ceasefire, military reorganization, and restoration of transportation, but also overturned the five resolutions of the PCC and Chairman Chiang's four promises." For example, regarding the reorganization of the government, "the government has always failed to agree on the number of committee members and the one-third veto power according to the resolution, and violated the resolution to select these committee members from other parties and non-party members on the Kuomintang Central Standing Committee." Also, "regarding the resolutions of the National Assembly, first, because the government had not been reorganized and the draft constitution had not been deliberated, all parties were inconvenient to submit a list of representatives. Later, because the government side proposed to increase the number of representatives, the proportion of representatives was not agreed upon. As the fifth and fifth terms approached, the PCC Synthesis Group, under the convening of Chairman Chiang, decided to postpone the National Assembly and explained that the date of the meeting would be determined after all matters had been agreed upon. Unexpectedly, on July 3, the government unilaterally announced that the National Assembly would be convened on November 12 of this year, without consultation with the PCC, and the resolutions of the PCC were swept away."</p>
<p>The editorial pointed out that "one of the main reasons why the Kuomintang dared to overturn the PCC is because the United States government gives them help in any situation." The editorial then pointed out that General Marshall cannot but bear considerable responsibility on this issue. However, General Marshall and Ambassador Stuart's efforts are not impossible to succeed."</p>
<p>The editorial finally analyzed the sixth guideline proposed in Chairman Chiang's message, pointing out that the aforementioned five demands were the center of it. "The center is that the war cannot be stopped unless the Communist Party withdraws from certain areas." The editorial clearly stated that "it is even more impossible for the PCC to handle matters such as agreeing on the representatives of the National Assembly and appointing various committees with the participation of people from all parties."</p>
<h3>Special Envoy Marshall Returns to Nanjing Today; Remains Optimistic about the Prospects for Peace Talks; Ministry of Civil Affairs Has Not Received Recommendations on Reconvening the PCC</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Guling, 26th] Special Envoy Marshall is scheduled to leave Guling and return to Nanjing on the 27th. In the past two days, Marshall has maintained frequent contact with Ambassador Stuart in Nanjing. Marshall is able to spend his time leisurely and remains very optimistic about the prospects for talks.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 26th] News from Guling today stated that Special Envoy Marshall is currently drafting a new plan to form a five-member committee composed of two representatives from the National and Communist sides and one representative from the American side to resume peace talks on the basis of government reorganization. Reports here that the American representative of the committee will be Ambassador Stuart have not been confirmed by official sources.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, 26th] There was no contact in the capital's political negotiations on the 26th, and Ambassador Stuart had no activities. In the evening, he was invited by Kong Xiangxi, a trustee of Yenching University, to Kong's residence for dinner and continued to discuss Yenching University affairs.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guling, 26th] After the news that a talk was held in Guling was proven to be untrue, Zeng Qi, Chu Fucheng, and others first requested that the Political Participation Conference be convened ahead of schedule, and then the Democratic League requested that the PCC or the PCC Synthesis Group meeting be reconvened. The reporter recently asked Wu, the Chief of Civil Affairs of the National Government, about his opinion on this matter. He stated that, according to common sense, since the term of the current Political Participation Conference has been extended for half a year, a general meeting should be convened once before the National Assembly is convened. The time of the meeting will be determined by the Chairman. As for the PCC and its Synthesis Group meetings, they are not statutory permanent deliberative bodies, and the Ministry of Civil Affairs has not received any recommendations for the Democratic League's proposal to reconvene them.</p>
<h3>Electrification of National Defense Education Movement; Chairman Orders Efforts to Promote It; China Film Studio Reorganized into Military Education Film Studio</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Guling, 26th] It is reported that Chairman Chiang attaches great importance to strengthening military and political education through film propaganda and has personally instructed the relevant authorities to make efforts to promote it. It is expected that one year after the restoration of transportation nationwide, the aforementioned new types of educational films can be widely disseminated to rural areas nationwide.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guling, 26th] The national defense education movement for the popularization of electrification, which Minister Bai suggested to reporters in Guling, is now known to have been recommended by Marshal Marshall. Recently, when Marshal Marshall met with Minister Bai and Chief of Staff Chen in Nanjing and Guling, he introduced the achievements of the United States in using electrified education to mobilize 12 million civilians with no military knowledge to train them into brave and skilled troops in the shortest possible time during the World War II to Bai and Chen. It is reported that after the China Film Studio is reorganized into a military education film studio, Luo Jingyu, who has just returned from the United States to study film, will be the director, and a large number of military education films will be produced as teaching materials to promote the popularization and universalization of national defense education.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Suzhou, 26th] Xu Gui, the former Chief of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, was sentenced by the First Criminal Division of the Jiangsu High Court on the morning of the 16th. The main text: Xu Gui colluded with enemy countries and conspired to resist this country, sentenced to 15 years of imprisonment, deprived of public rights for ten years, and all property confiscated except for the necessary living expenses reserved for family members.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Kunming, 26th] The perpetrators of the Wen Yiduo case, Tang Shiliang and Li Wenshan, were executed by firing squad today. The public notice issued by the Army Headquarters stated: According to the report submitted by the Yunnan Garrison Headquarters on the case of Tang Shiliang and Li Wenshan shooting and killing Wen Yiduo and his son Lihe, after the Army Headquarters organized a military collegial court to interrogate them, they both confessed to shooting and killing Wen Yiduo and his son Lihe. It was found that Tang Shiliang and Li Wenshan were both active-duty soldiers who dared to kill people with guns in this city while performing their duties, which was a complete disregard for the law. According to Article 271, Paragraph 1 and Article 37, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law, they were sentenced to death and deprived of public rights for life. It has been approved by the court.

<h3>The Murderer of Zhang Xinfu, Mo Guangcheng, Confesses the Process; The Whole Incident Was a Premeditated Conspiracy by the Communist Army; The Truth is Revealed</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Shenyang, 25th] Mo Guangcheng, the main culprit in the murder of Zhang Xinfu, which shocked both inside and outside Shanhaiguan, was arrested in Huludao in early July. After being transferred through the 93rd Army, the First Army Group Headquarters of Jie Jin, he was transferred to Shenyang on the 19th of this month. After interrogation by the military law office of the Commander-in-Chief's Headquarters, Mo confessed that the assassination of Zhang Xinfu was a premeditated conspiracy by the Communist Party. At that time, he was under the command of the 8th Brigade Headquarters of the Liaodong Military Region. On the day Zhang was killed, Liu Ziyi, the deputy commander of the Communist Security Brigade, was also at the Lishizhai Railway Station. Mo is from Xiagezhuang, Tiezhen Town, Zunhua County. According to his confession, he has five brothers, all of whom joined the Eighth Route Army. He is the youngest, and his four older brothers all died in the anti-Japanese war. When the Communist Army entered Shanhaiguan, he was a platoon leader in the Second Company of the First Battalion of the 12th Regiment. During the reorganization in Jinzhou, he was reorganized into the Seventh Company of the Third Battalion of the 23rd Regiment, serving as the deputy company commander and acting company commander.</p>
<h3>Entire Confession</h3>
<p>The criminal Mo continued to confess that when Zhang was killed, I was stationed at Li Shizhai, and I received an order from the 8th Brigade Headquarters stating that the train carrying the takeover personnel had already passed. If it returned towards Shenyang, it must be detained, and everyone on board must be arrested; otherwise, military law would be applied. At that time, the head of the security group was running around to various stations all day for this matter, and I barely slept. One day (I forgot the date), I suddenly received a phone call saying that the train would be returning to Shenyang, ordering me not to arrest Zhang Xinfu and others for the time being, and to wait until Shenjingzi before taking action. At about 9 PM that day, the deputy commander of the Security Brigade, Liu Ziyi, arrived at Li Shizhai Station. I had gone to the battalion headquarters on business. Deputy Commander Liu said to Chen Guidong, the platoon leader stationed at the station, that the train taking over the Fushun coal mine was about to return, with a certain Guo political commissar who had connections with the Eighth Route Army and a Soviet major (whose name I didn't know), along with several Soviet soldiers. He ordered Platoon Leader Chen to arrest all the people on the train. When I returned from the battalion headquarters, Zhang Xinfu and his eight attendants had already been tied up at the station, their overcoats had been taken off, and they were only wearing plain clothes. At that time, the Soviet soldiers had already slipped away on the train, completely shirking their responsibility to protect Zhang Xinfu. Later, Deputy Commander Liu ordered me to take Zhang Xinfu and the others to the wilderness. The political commissar Guo gave me the same order, also saying that Zhang Xinfu was a major traitor. Because they were not my direct superiors, and I wasn't sure if the order was authentic, I couldn't be responsible if I was investigated later, so I refused to carry it out. Deputy Commander Liu then sent two guards to force me to kill Zhang Xinfu. Under duress, I had to take Zhang Xinfu and the others to the south hillside and order my soldiers to kill them with bayonets. Zhang Xinfu didn't say a word before his death, acting as if nothing was happening, but his attitude was tough. His attendants, however, were like pathetic worms, begging not to be killed, but they were all killed. That was around 10 PM that night. The next day, Deputy Commander Liu called me to the Fushun Command Headquarters, asking what I thought. I said nothing, because I was ordered by my direct superior, I was afraid of unexpected consequences. He said that it was absolutely nothing to do with me, and that he would take full responsibility. About ten days later, the Soviet commander also summoned me to their headquarters, asking if any Soviet soldiers had participated in or sympathized with the execution of Zhang and the others. I said that there were Soviet soldiers on the train, but they did not participate in the execution, but they probably sympathized. I also said that this matter was entirely the idea of the Security Commander Liu Ziyi and the Political Commissar Guo. Later, the troops set off, and I was detained by the Soviet army for more than forty days. The Soviet commander returned to Shenyang from Changchun and then released me. By that time, the troops had already gone to Liaoyang, where we started fighting the Central Army. We were ordered to retreat to Changchun, and then to Dahushan for rest. At that time, I took ten men and deserted, intending to surrender to the National Army. We clashed with the Eighth Route Army on the way and were scattered. I planned to go home, but I knew there were still Eighth Route Army soldiers in my hometown, so I changed my plans and engaged in small business in Huludao. The capital was 50,000 national currency from selling a watch. I bought and sold cigarettes and stored them at Zhao Peiyun's house in Daochi, where I also lived. I was arrested after living there for more than ten days. An officer often bought cigarettes from me in plain clothes, and I later learned that he was an officer from the regimental headquarters of the garrison troops, and so on. In summary, Mo's confession is sufficient to prove the Communist army's conspiracy and the international significance of the case. The truth of the Zhang Xinfu murder case is now clear.</p>
<h3>The Great Thief Lu Tieshan of Yin Was Captured in Yuhang Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Hangzhou Dispatch on the 26th] The great thief Lu Tieshan, who had conspired with gangsters such as Xu Genfa to rob exclusively in the Ningbo city area for more than three years, committing murder and robbery with countless crimes, was once arrested in February of this year but escaped by breaking out of prison with a hacksaw. Afterwards, he rampaged again in the city area, committing as many as forty or fifty crimes in three months. Because the police station had set a deadline for solving the case, he hid in Menlinbu, Yuhang. The Yin police tracked him down and captured him yesterday, and he was escorted back to Ningbo today.</p>
<h3>U.S. Surplus Materials in Shanghai Confirmed to Be Illegally Sold; McB Claims to Be Investigating</h3>
<p>[United Press Dispatch from this city] According to authoritative sources: the Shanghai office of the U.S. Foreign Surplus Property Disposal Administration illegally disposed of materials, causing U.S. taxpayers to lose nearly millions of dollars. An order has been issued to investigate thoroughly. The scope of the investigation is said to include the following: (1) Selling perfectly usable airplanes worth millions of dollars to the Central Airlines for 50,000 dollars; (2) Reclassifying surplus aircraft parts and equipment transferred by the U.S. Air Force, marked as "new," "intact," and "largely intact," and marking them as "clearance sale," selling items originally worth hundreds of thousands of dollars for only a few thousand dollars; (3) Canceling a contract originally signed with an American trading company, and then reselling it to the Chinese side, the sales price and part of the American firm's price. This same material was then resold by the purchaser to the American company at a high price; (4) The Shanghai office disregarded the regulations on priority purchase rights when selling surplus materials; (5) Handing over ships and other equipment worth millions of dollars to the Chinese side without signing a contract or agreeing on a price (some of these ships are now said to have been rejected by the Chinese side, who spent huge sums on repairs and demanded compensation from the United States). It is said that investigators are also interested in the lifestyles of some Disposal Administration officials, some of whom have extremely luxurious private residences, and at least one of whom currently lives in one of Shanghai's most luxurious residences, which is owned by a major customer who purchases foreign Disposal Administration materials.</p>
<p>At the same time, some Disposal Administration officials are accused of violating regulations by engaging in concurrent jobs with Chinese official or commercial organizations, and this matter is also under investigation. It is also learned that internal disputes have repeatedly arisen within the Shanghai office of the U.S. Foreign Disposal Administration because Inspector McKenna believed that some contracts were questionable. Mr. McKenna even resigned in anger to protest the Disposal Administration's work in China. A formal investigation into the current situation of the Shanghai office will begin as soon as Inspector Maddy arrives here from Washington. Mr. Maddy was specially dispatched by the headquarters after reports of illegal corruption reached Washington.</p>
<p>The authoritative source also said: So far, the investigation has hardly officially begun. It has now been suggested that if this investigation cannot quickly achieve a satisfactory result locally, the Senate Maytag Committee or the U.S. Department of Justice may intervene, as the inside story of the case is complicated and involves army, navy, and civilian personnel.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] Mr. McB, head of the U.S. Foreign Materials Disposal Administration, who is currently conducting an investigation in Shanghai, has confirmed the United Press report after seeing it. He issued a statement yesterday, stating: "The case of the alleged illegal sale of U.S. surplus materials in Shanghai is indeed under investigation." According to McB, the complaint reached his Washington office on July 24, and he immediately sent an inspector to Shanghai for a detailed investigation. After McB arrived in Shanghai, the director of the Shanghai office, Johnson, requested that the U.S. military headquarters investigate at the same time, which is also underway. McB stated: "An appropriate statement will be issued after the investigation is completed." He also said that it is the Disposal Administration's consistent policy to quickly investigate any illegal cases.</p>
<h3>Relief Work Unfolds in Recovered Areas of Anhui Province</h3>

<h3>Security Conference of the First Pacification Zone Postponed</h3>
<p>[Our Suzhou Dispatch on the 26th] The Security Conference of the First Pacification Zone, which was originally scheduled to be held in Changshu on the 27th of this month, has been postponed.

<h3>Materials Worth 4 Billion; The Quartermaster General of the Sixth War Area Disposed of Them Without Authorization; The Wuhan Investigation Team Has Raised Questions</h3>
<p>[Our Hankou Dispatch on the 25th] Regarding the received materials retained by the former Quartermaster General Headquarters of the Sixth War Area, after the investigation team raised questions with the headquarters and reviewed relevant documents, it was deemed a great regret that materials worth more than 400,000 were disposed of by the headquarters without authorization. The investigation process was released tonight, publicly condemning it, with rather stern wording. Here are the main points in summary: A. The retention and distribution of these materials were not submitted to the central government for approval in advance, but only reported to the Ministry of Military Administration for record after the fact. B. The more than 140 types of materials distributed were not only large in quantity but also mostly non-military items. C. After receiving the report, the Ministry of Military Administration not only did not approve it but also gently condemned it as exceeding the scope of reception and instructed that the materials should be sold by the Ministry of Economic Affairs through public auction. D. After the Chief Executive Headquarters was denied the request by the Ministry of Military Administration, it continued to retain and distribute the materials. E. The circumstances of this case are serious, and it has been decided to immediately submit it to the central government for instructions on how to handle it. Furthermore, the number of distributed items and the number of recipients do not match.</p>
<p>[Our Hankou Dispatch on the 26th] The investigation team announced that the largest quantity of retained materials in the Sixth War Area were silk and wool fabrics, etc., totaling more than 140 types. More than half of them were received by the former Chief Executive Headquarters of the Sixth War Area, the Wuhan Garrison Headquarters, and the Quartermaster General Headquarters of the Sixth War Area, etc. The total number of people was only over 2,600, with each person receiving an average of over one million yuan in value. The investigation team's final conclusion stated: With such illegal procedures, mobilizing so many materials, those responsible for reviewing and distributing them cannot shirk their major responsibility. If it is said that it was to avoid material spoilage, then it is found that most of the types are non-perishable. If it is said that it was due to urgent needs, then each agency and troop already had formal budgets and supplies. If it is said that the recipient units have contributed to the country and should be rewarded, it must also be planned by the government as a whole, and rewards cannot be given from below, allowing a few people to obtain such a large amount of illegal income. Furthermore, as the enemy has devoured our flesh and blood, how can we learn from the pain and strive to return every bit to the public to increase national strength and relieve the suffering of the people?</p>
<h3>Tianjin Investigation Team Uncovers Three Major Corruption Cases</h3>

<h3>Director Arrested for Reception Fraud; Zhang Xiaochun Detained</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Dispatch on the 26th] The reception investigation team announced a confirmed reception fraud case on the 26th. One of the corrupt officials is Zhang Xiaochun, acting director of the Transportation Office of the Tianjin Public Utilities Bureau.

The investigation team received a tip that Zhang and others had committed fraud amounting to 200 million yuan. On the 26th, they went to Zhang's office to investigate and requested to see the original register from the time of reception. Zhang then submitted a register filled with alterations, with items listed as having been reduced in quantity. The alterations were stamped with the seal of the Japanese Miyamoto. Huang Yuren, a member of the investigation team, then discovered a copy of the register in his drawer that had no alterations. He then discovered a wooden Miyamoto seal, which confirmed that Zhang had submitted a falsified register. The Tianjin District Prosecutor of the Court then arrested Zhang and escorted him to the court, where he was immediately prosecuted.</p>
<h3>Local Communications; Provincial Chairman of Jiangsu Issues Order to Do Everything Possible to Stabilize Prices</h3>
<p>[Our Zhenjiang Communication] Following the government's adjustment of the foreign exchange rate, Chairman Wang of Jiangsu Province, fearing that people in society would misunderstand the reasons and cause price fluctuations, summoned representatives from the industrial and commercial sectors of the province on the 20th of this month to explain the government's intentions. On the 24th, he also issued an order to the county magistrates of each county, instructing them to quickly convene the chambers of commerce and trade associations of their respective counties to give earnest guidance, and to work with party and group organizations to do everything possible to stabilize prices. The telegram stated briefly: "The government's adjustment of the foreign exchange rate is an appropriate measure to balance exports and imports, support production, stabilize prices, and promote the national economy, and is not related to domestic prices. This year, there has been a bumper harvest in various places, unprecedented in decades. Grain prices have already shown a downward trend, and other prices should not take the opportunity to rise. Industrial and commercial figures in various counties, either due to lack of information or insufficient understanding, may not fully understand this exchange rate adjustment, resulting in doubts, hesitations, and price increases. County magistrates should be responsible for explaining and guiding them, quickly convening the chambers of commerce and trade associations of their respective counties to provide earnest guidance, and working with party, group, and public opinion institutions to stabilize prices."</p>

He voluntarily led ten of his subordinates, carrying weapons, to surrender. In order to express his sincerity, he had his family members come to live in the city with him. The Zokai unit does not hold the past against the surrendered Communist bandits, and has given them preferential treatment and provided them with proper accommodation.</p>

<h3>Hangzhou City Council; Second Congress Opens</h3>
<p>[Our Hangzhou Dispatch on the 26th] The Second Congress of the Hangzhou City Council opened yesterday morning. Speaker Luo Yun requested leave due to illness, and Deputy Speaker Xu Di presided over the meeting and delivered a speech, stating: Today, Hangzhou has presented a tragic scene of external weakness and internal exhaustion. Factories and shops have closed down, schools cannot be restored, the sick have no way to receive medical treatment, and the poor have nothing to eat. Only West Lake and a few roads are not worth mentioning, so it is not appropriate to regard the increase in financial revenue as a political achievement. We should have the spirit of helping those who are drowning and feeding those who are hungry, earnestly relieve the poor and sick, develop agricultural and industrial production, maintain legitimate commerce, improve education, and strengthen the Baojia system. I hope that the municipal government will display a spirit of revolutionary sacrifice and unleash administrative efficiency. Following this, Zhang Qiang, chairman of the Provincial Party Department, spoke about local autonomy. Ruan Yicheng, Director of the Department of Civil Affairs, reported on the work guidelines of the various departments on behalf of the provincial government and expressed three hopes: (1) Government organizations are complex, but all citizens, whether central or local, can review and make suggestions. (2) Municipal administration should focus on construction. (3) The government and the City Council are both established for the people, and the two are one, so I hope that there will be more speeches. Mayor Zhou Xiangxian then stated: "Responsible, open cooperation" will be the administrative attitude for the future. In the afternoon, Secretary-General Xu Fusan reported on council affairs, passed the rules for citizen attendance, and delivered a declaration, elaborating on five key points: (1) Revitalizing the atmosphere, (2) Practicing the rule of law, (3) Venerating science, (4) Improving people's livelihoods, (5) Promoting construction. Mayor Zhou then reported on municipal administration.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>After the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) Issued a Statement</h3>
<p>The conflict between the Kuomintang (KMT) and the CCP, as of yesterday, has become even more confusing due to the CCP's statement!</p>
<p>Since Marshal Ma [Marshall] and Ambassador Stuart jointly issued a statement on the 10th of this month, issuing a serious warning, the negotiations have reached a final stage, and conflicts in various regions have intensified. Fortunately, Chairman Chiang, adhering to his original intention of peace, issued a letter to the people of the whole country on the 14th, outlining six political solutions, which were not only supported by the people of the whole country but also received good comments from friendly nations. Unexpectedly, the CCP considered Chairman Chiang's message as a sign that the government was "preparing for a military offensive," so Yan'an issued a mobilization order and publicly declared the existence of a state of war. At the same time, it intensified its siege of Datong militarily, and the great battle in the eastern section of the Longhai Railway broke out as a result.</p>
<p>However, the CCP also knows that the people cannot be completely deceived, so it changed its tune orally, saying that the issuance of the mobilization order was not a declaration of war. At the same time, it announced that the Central Government would also issue a statement to respond to Chairman Chiang's proclamation. However, its statement was repeatedly revised, and it was not issued in Nanjing until 3:00 PM yesterday. Although we have been waiting for this statement for a long time, and we thought it might add some decisive factors to the future development of the situation, after reading it, we still feel that the CCP only has clever tactics but no real sincerity in seeking peace, which makes us even more lost.</p>
<p>The CCP's statement still sings its old tune of "immediate and unconditional ceasefire," but let us ask, who issued the mobilization order? And look at whose troops are besieging Datong? The ironclad facts cannot be denied. In the past year, who has been attacking in the overall situation of China? Who was forced to defend? Who wants war? Who desires peace? The Chinese people see it very clearly, and there is no need to engage in more propaganda warfare or nerve warfare. I remember when the CCP occupied Changchun and advanced into Harbin in the Northeast, they were also shouting the slogan of unconditional ceasefire. Such inconsistent words and deeds have happened more than once!</p>
<p>As for "implementing the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference (PCC)," it is even more ridiculous. The government originally had the determination to implement the PCC resolutions. If it were not for the CCP's breach of faith, these agreements would have been implemented long ago. Moreover, in fact, the government has been implementing the reorganization, demobilization, and retirement of the national army step by step, which was also acknowledged by the U.S. mediator, Special Envoy Marshall. However, on the CCP's side, not only did it not fulfill the basic plan of unified reorganization, but it also recruited troops and horses everywhere and desperately expanded its army. What kind of unification is this? As for the reorganization of the government, the government repeatedly invited the CCP to submit a list of names in March and April, but the CCP deliberately procrastinated. The CCP also failed to nominate representatives as agreed for the convening of the National Assembly, and instead launched a major war in the Northeast. Even Special Envoy Marshall repeatedly requested that "the CCP withdraw from Changchun before discussing other issues," but the CCP consistently turned a deaf ear and refused to accept it, so the Central Government had no choice but to use force to recover Changchun. However, the Central Government still ordered a ceasefire in June to await consultations, but so far there have been no results.</p>
<p>Standing from the people's perspective, we once again call on both the KMT and the CCP: the people's livelihood is exhausted, and it is now worse than ever. What is needed now is to live in peace and work happily. The CCP, for the sake of cherishing its own future, should accept the public will of the people, pull back from the precipice, and not be the leader of internal chaos. ...</p>
<p>Since the CCP says it wants an immediate and unconditional ceasefire and the implementation of the PCC resolutions, it should be consistent in word and deed, immediately lay down its weapons, and resume peace talks with the government to discuss a practical and effective method for implementing the two principles of "political democratization" and "nationalization of the army" simultaneously. During this period, in order to show its impartiality and do its best, the government should also automatically expand the foundation of the government, strive for efficiency and integrity, and eliminate all the accumulated bad habits of bureaucratic corruption, thereby creating an excellent political atmosphere, and then take a further step to amend the draft constitution and convene the National Assembly as scheduled to embark on the right track of constitutional governance.</p>
<h3>Announcement of the Verdict in the Wen Case</h3>
<p>The verdict in the Wen case has been announced. The main offenders, Tang Shiliang and Li Wenshan, were sentenced to death. The case has been reported to Chairman Chiang by Commander-in-Chief of the Army Gu Zhutong. Once approved, the execution will be carried out. At the same time, Huo Kuizhang, Commander-in-Chief of the Kunming Garrison, was dismissed from his post for dereliction of duty and placed under surveillance pending legal action. Thus, the Wen case, which caused a sensation for a time, has come to an end. Before the truth of this case was clear, we were not in a position to comment on it. Now that the case has ended, let us state our views:</p>
<p>Although the motives for assassination cases vary, the country has a legal code, and criminals can hardly escape the sanctions of the national law. When we heard the news of the assassination of Professor Wen Yiduo of the United Nations University, we mourned the shooting death of this scholar, which caused the country to lose a national talent and negatively affected the country's laws, social order, and international standing. As for the pursuit and prosecution of the murderers, that is naturally the responsibility of the national institutions. Before the murderers are caught and the truth is revealed, there is no need to make too many guesses or speculations. The current verdict in the Wen case shows that the motive for the assassination was purely simple, with no instigation or so-called political effect. It was purely a vengeful act committed by the murderer due to a momentary impulse. Obviously, it cannot be used by politicians as a kind of political capital to expand propaganda.</p>
<p>Second, for handling assassination cases, the country has existing institutions dedicated to the matter. The assassination of Professor Wen Yiduo is the same as the assassination of anyone else. In any country, assassination cases are almost inevitable. Therefore, the legal codes of various countries have clear provisions for the trial of assassination incidents. Now that the state has specially dispatched the Commander-in-Chief of the Army to preside over the investigation and trial of Professor Wen's death, this is certainly sufficient to show the importance that our government attaches to this case. It is in fact what the state should do. May I ask whether in the United Kingdom, the United States, or even the Soviet Union, would the Commander-in-Chief of the Army preside over the investigation and trial of the murder of a university professor? Now that the country is facing many difficulties, the government, in order to thoroughly investigate the case and handle it impartially, had no choice but to send a senior official to preside over it, and the outcome of the trial was also fair and impartial. All these things should be understood by the people of the country.</p>
<p>Now that the Wen case has been judged, the case can be closed once the main culprits are executed. As for the case of Li Gongpu, the murderer has not yet been arrested, so the details of the case have not yet been fully clarified. We can only earnestly hope that the government will step up the arrest of the murderer, and we dare to believe that the case will be solved one day, and the truth of the whole case will eventually come to light. Those who like to make trouble need not speculate too much. However, according to the facts of the crime published in the verdict of the Wen case, the cause of this case was that Professor Wen's speech at Li Gongpu's memorial service slandered the government and insulted the military even more, and the murderer was provoked by righteous indignation and developed the intention to kill. We believe that the murderer's violation of the criminal law is absolutely unforgivable, and what we feel regrettable about is that Professor Wen, such a talented person, as a professor at a national university, publicly slandered the government and even insulted the military, so that a lower-ranking military officer, whose knowledge was not as good as Wen's, and who was at the prime of his youth, had a tragic incident that went beyond the norm. Soldiers, like people in any other profession, inevitably have both good and bad people, but those who hold weapons to defend the country are still soldiers. They have experienced hundreds of battles and tasted all kinds of hardships, and they should be worthy of our love and respect. Professor Wen lived in a turbulent era, and his death is worthy of our regret, but it is also worthy of our deep consideration. China lacks talent, and we must cherish these few talents; and for the sake of the nation, we especially hope that these few talents should cherish themselves even more.</p>
<h3>Can the Government Suppress the Price of Yarn?</h3>
<p>After the adjustment of foreign exchange last Monday, prices have been generally stable for the past week, especially for rice and flour, which have had the least fluctuations. Although gold once soared, it soon fell back and was not much different from the market price before the adjustment. Only cotton yarn is different!</p>
<p>Yesterday, the black market price for 20-count Shuangma yarn was 1.82 million, and it closed slightly lower at 1.78 million, an increase of 420,000 from 1.36 million the previous Saturday, a rise of 33 percent. 42-count Lanfeng yarn closed at 2.46 million, an increase of 550,000 from 1.9 million the previous Saturday, also a rise of 30 percent. If the government continues to stand by, it may continue to rise.</p>
<p>We have long pointed out that after the foreign exchange adjustment, if we really want to control prices and prevent them from rising, the government must use all its power to control them in advance. The Central Standing Committee discussed that it is necessary to control three categories of prices, namely (1) daily necessities for people's livelihood, such as rice, coal, oil, salt, cotton yarn, and cloth, etc., (2) transportation and public utilities, and (3) gold, the standard for exchange, so that they do not rise. We deeply agree with this. Now, the government claims to control the cotton yarn produced in large quantities, but it has had the bad effect of soaring prices for days. Who should be responsible for this?</p>
<p>According to reports, the China Textile Corporation, due to the decision of the board of directors, followed the government's instructions not to raise prices and sold yarn at yesterday's prices, with 20-count Lanfeng yarn at 1.16 million and 42-count Lanfeng yarn at 1.9 million, which were the same as before the foreign exchange adjustment on the previous Saturday. However, the black market price outside was 1.5 million for the former and as high as 2.46 million for the latter. First of all, we want to ask: Is the government going to do anything about it? Will it punish those who are raising prices on the black market? Second, we want to ask: Is the China Textile Corporation turning a blind eye to the fact that yarn distributed as usual can earn 4-500,000 yuan per package in the hands of yarn and cloth merchants who resell it? Third, we want to ask: On the day of the foreign exchange adjustment, the municipal government seemed to be vigorously stabilizing prices, and the trade association also seemed willing to work together to maintain the original price. How is the municipal government doing now? What is the trade association saying?</p>
<p>We believe that prices are a big cycle, and it is definitely not possible to allow one section to be broken through; otherwise, a single strand will affect the whole body. The rise in yarn prices may cause the rise in other prices. Today, whether the government can suppress the price of yarn is a touchstone for whether it can stabilize general prices in the future.</p>

<h3>Australian Representative Proposes Setting Up a Committee to Handle Compensation and Hospitality Matters, Based on the Principle of Not Threatening the Political Independence of Defeated Countries; Yugoslavia Demands Huge Reparations from Italy</h3>
<p>[Reported by Our Newspaper from Multiple Sources] According to a broadcast from London on the 26th: The Yugoslav delegation formally proposed at the peace conference today that Italy pay 130 billion yuan in reparations, which is 14 times more than the amount that the four powers previously decided Italy should pay to the Soviet Union. Yugoslavia's demands include transferring some of Italy's factories, machinery, livestock, and remaining merchant ships to Yugoslavia as part of the reparations. At the same time, the Balkan Economic Committee met at the peace conference today to discuss the economic clauses in the treaty with Romania. The Australian representative proposed that the four powers and any three other countries selected should form an Allied Reparations Committee to handle the implementation of the reparations clauses in the treaty, while paying special attention to whether the defeated country has the ability to continue to pay reparations. It is stipulated that Romania should pay the Soviet Union goods worth 300 million yuan as reparations, to be paid in full in eight years. The Australian representative said that Australia did not want to demand reparations from any Balkan country, but was afraid that the excessive amount of reparations would inevitably threaten the political independence of these countries. We should help the defeated countries to stand on their feet in the international community and become independent countries in the future. The Australian representative advocated that any former enemy country should not directly hand over the reparations goods to the victorious country, but should hand them over to the Reparations Committee for transfer and conversion into reparations. In this way, the defeated country would only have relations with the United Nations and not have direct contact with the victorious country, which would better maintain its national sovereignty.</p>
<h3>Heated Debate Between Soviet and Australian Representatives at the Balkan Committee; Soviet Union Plans to Reduce its Reparations Demands from Hungary</h3>
<p>According to Agence France-Presse: The Paris Peace Conference continued on the 26th, with the following agenda: (1) The Committee on Political and Territorial Questions Relating to Italy was scheduled to meet at 10:00 AM; (2) The Balkan Committee met; (3) The Military Committee met; (4) The Committee on Economic Questions Relating to Italy met at 4:00 PM; (5) The Committee on Political and Territorial Questions Relating to Bulgaria was also scheduled to meet at 4:00 PM.</p>
<p>According to a broadcast from Paris on the 26th: At the meeting of the Balkan Committee, Molotov stood up and made a lengthy speech refuting the Australian representative's arguments. He stated that the German army's invasion of the Soviet Union was due to the assistance of Antonescu's fascist army. He also recounted the fact that Romanian troops invaded and occupied Ukraine in 1941, saying that the Soviet Union would never forget these facts under any circumstances. Molotov continued that the terms of the armistice agreement with Romania were signed not only by the Soviet Union but also by the United States. The provisions of the treaty with Romania, which are in question here, are fair and well-founded. The Soviet Union believes that the economic situation in Romania after the war is already quite difficult. The Romanian delegation attending the peace conference did not object to the reparations clauses in the treaty, and the Australian representative's concern for this issue seems to be even greater than that of the Romanians themselves. However, Australia is thousands of miles away, and the Australian representative's proposal to pay reparations in British pounds or US dollars implies that Romania will rely on the British and American monetary systems. However, this method is not really beneficial to Romania and will only aggravate its plight. Molotov pointed out that the agreement on reparations between the Soviet Union and Romania is more reasonable. The Australian proposal is not of a nature to stabilize peace in Europe and is of no benefit to Australia itself. Therefore, he hoped that the Australian delegation would withdraw its amendment proposal, because Article 22 of the draft prepared by the Council of Foreign Ministers of the Four Powers provides all the advantages and guarantees. The French translation will be submitted tomorrow morning, at which point the meeting was adjourned. The meeting will then continue to review and discuss Article 22.</p>
<p>According to a United Press dispatch from Paris on the 26th: The Soviet Union is about to announce a reduction in its reparations demands from Hungary. The amount of the reduction has not yet been announced, but it is said to be considerable enough to ensure that Hungary does not need to restore its economy on a painful balancing basis. The Soviet Union also allowed more raw materials to be allocated to Hungarian factories, implementing Hungarian-Soviet reciprocity.</p>
<h3>Five-Nation Treaty Draft: 50,000 Words Awaiting Deliberation</h3>
<p>[United Press, Paris] The Committee on Political and Territorial Questions Relating to Italy adopted 18 more words of the preamble to the Treaty with Italy on the 26th. In the four weeks since the peace conference began, a total of 153 words have been adopted. The draft treaty with the five defeated countries still has 55,000 words to be deliberated, and there has been no progress on the other four draft treaties. The 18 words passed are included in the fourth section of the preamble. After an hour of debate, they were unanimously approved, with Yugoslavia abstaining. The amendment was proposed by the Dutch representative to expand the recognition of Italy's assistance to the Allies after the overthrow of the Mussolini regime. After slight modifications, it was finally passed.</p>
<h3>Preparations for the Four-Power Conference to Expedite the Work of the Peace Conference</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse] London diplomatic sources recently stated that as soon as British Foreign Secretary Bevin returns to Paris, steps will be taken to prepare for a Four-Power Conference to expedite the work of the peace conference. If the Four-Power Conference cannot be held, the peace conference will be delayed until the end of this year, and important issues such as the issues of Germany and Japan will not be resolved. Heads of delegations from several countries at the peace conference have left Paris. Australian Foreign Minister Evatt departed on the evening of the 24th to return to his country. Canadian Prime Minister Mackenzie King departed on the morning of the 25th to return to his country via London. U.S. Representative to the Peace Conference Vandenberg arrived in Paris on the 25th aboard President Truman's special plane, the "Sacred Cow."</p>
<h3>Curfew in Tehran</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Tehran, 25th] It is announced here: The new curfew measures announced by the military commander last week are routine measures to begin winter prevention, advancing the curfew by one hour. Tehran has been under curfew since 1942.</p>
<h3>Italian Prime Minister Wins Cabinet Confidence</h3>
<p>[United Press, Rome, 26th] Three hours after Italian Prime Minister Gasperi presented a report at the Paris Peace Conference hoping to ease the conditions on Italy, the Italian cabinet unanimously passed a vote of confidence in him. Gasperi explained to all cabinet members that he had asked various countries to extend the discussion of the issue of Trieste because the Four Powers could not find a suitable compromise, and at the same time he was prepared to negotiate this issue directly with Yugoslavia.</p>
<h3>Ukraine Accuses Greece, Security Council Adds to Agenda; Britain Believes This is the Prelude to Soviet Action, Wanting to Force Britain and the United States to Withdraw from the Danube Region</h3>
<p>[Reported by Our Newspaper from Multiple Sources] According to Agence France-Presse, New York, the United Nations Secretariat announced on the 25th that the Security Council will meet on the 28th of this month and has added the complaint filed by the Ukrainian representative to the agenda. At that time, the Council will first discuss the requests of several non-member states to join the United Nations organization, and then discuss this issue. According to Reuters, New York, observers at the United Nations Headquarters believe that the Ukrainian accusation against Greece's actions against Albania was filed at this time, not only because the issue of new member states will be discussed. However, the Ukrainian complaint is sufficient to strengthen Albania's demand to join the United Nations, which has been raised by the governments of Britain and the United States and is now being discussed. As to whether the British Permanent Representative Jebb will refer to the fact that there are British troops stationed in Greece as mentioned by Ukraine, the British delegation has not yet expressed its views.</p>
<h3>Astonishing News from the Soviet Union: Britain Establishes Military Supply Base in Tatar, Building Radar Stations to Detect Submarines</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Moscow, 25th] The Soviet News Agency Beirut reported a report from "local people" that Britain has established a military supply base in Tatar, and a Turkish airfield near Istanbul has also been attached to the British. The military base is said to be similar in form to the base in Basra, Iraq, while the airfield is located in Eskishehir. The Soviet News Agency said that local people said that on the coast of Thrace in Greece and the Black Sea coast of Turkey, British military experts have set up a radar station to detect submarines. The Beirut report also said that a British military advisor and instructor at a radar station between Istanbul and Buyukdere threatened to resign unless he was directly responsible for the command of the radar station. The Turkish authorities immediately accepted his request, appointed him as the station chief, and assigned a Turkish military officer as his assistant. The Turkish News Agency stated yesterday that the Soviet News Agency's claim that the British were supervising the construction of airfields in Turkey was groundless.</p>

<h3>The Soviet Union Actively Develops Industry in the Far East</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 26th] The Soviet Cabinet held a meeting today and passed several decrees aimed at promoting and developing light and heavy industry in the Ural region, Siberia, and the Soviet Far East, as well as coal, oil, building materials, and other industrial production. According to this decree, the wages of 824,000 workers employed in the various industries in these regions will be increased by 20%. The authorities also have housing for workers to live in, with each house priced at 8,000 to 13,000 rubles, to be paid in installments over ten years.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, the spokesperson of the British Foreign Office indicated this evening, that the Ukrainian accusation that the presence of British troops within the borders of Greece constitutes a threat to peace is simply an act of "diplomatic counteroffensive" on the part of the Soviet Union and its surrounding European bloc. The Ukrainian delegate's actions today are meant as an act of revenge against the Western powers for their recent joint expression of unity with Great Britain. Observers here also hold the view that these actions by the Soviet satellite states are not isolated incidents, but rather serve as the prelude to greater actions on the part of the Soviet government. The underlying goal is to strengthen their positions and force the Western powers to withdraw entirely from the Danube region.</p>
<h3>Tchaikovsky to be Appointed Soviet Ambassador to England</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 26th] Sources close to the Paris Peace Conference say that the Soviet government has proposed that former Minister to Canada Tchaikovsky be appointed as the next Ambassador to England, filling the vacancy left by Gusev, who has taken over for Litvinov as Deputy Foreign Minister.</p>

<h3>Hundred Nurses from Different Countries, Called to America for Training</h3>
<p>Expenses Borne by UNRRA</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 25th] In order to improve the nursing profession in China and six European countries, UNRRA plans to call 100 nurses from these countries to the United States for advanced training, and then return to their countries to serve.

<h3>Paterson's Report Delivered to Washington; American Southern Incident Comes to a Close; South to Hold Grand Funeral for the Victims</h3>
<p>[Comprehensive Report from Our Newspaper] Regarding Yugoslavia's attitude towards the American ultimatum, the State Department has received a report from the American Ambassador to Yugoslavia, Paterson, dispatched from Belgrade. According to a Washington dispatch from the U.S. Information Service on the 25th, the report details his negotiations with Marshal Tito. All the circumstances have already been reported in this newspaper in recent days, so I will not repeat them. In summary, although Yugoslavia has not expressed submission in writing, it has actually implemented all the demands in the American ultimatum. Under these circumstances, the U.S. government will decide on its countermeasures based on how the Yugoslav government "corrects its past mistakes and the future developments." Regarding the second American aircraft shot down on the 19th, it is now confirmed that all five people on board perished, and the remains are scheduled to be transported to Belgrade on the 27th. According to a United Press report from Belgrade on the 25th, the Yugoslav authorities have agreed to hold a grand funeral for the deceased American airmen. According to an announcement by the American Embassy, several officers from the Yugoslav Fourth Army will accompany the funeral procession to the cemetery where the remains of the deceased American airmen are buried, exhume the remains, and then have the hearse draped with the national flag drive past President Tito's summer villa and return to Ljubljana. When the remains are transported to Belgrade, a squadron of Yugoslav fighter planes will escort Ambassador Paterson's special plane to the capital.</p>
<p>Although this matter can be said to have temporarily come to an end, it cannot be interpreted as the end of the deteriorating relationship between the United States and Yugoslavia. According to news from Paris, Marshal Tito may file a complaint with the United Nations, accusing British and American planes of flying over Yugoslav territory "hundreds of times." He believes this is a violation of Yugoslav sovereignty and an attempt to threaten Yugoslavia. At the same time, according to a United Press report, American diplomatic circles in Washington believe that there are still various fundamental issues hindering relations between the U.S. and Yugoslavia, as well as between the U.S. and the Soviet Union, which could erupt at any time, such as Trieste and the Dardanelles Strait.</p>
<h3>Dutch East Indies Requests MacArthur to Return Huge Amount of Diamonds Looted by Japan</h3>
<p>[United Press Tokyo, 26th] The Dutch East Indies today requested General MacArthur's headquarters to recover diamonds worth US$100 million looted by the Japanese army during the occupation.

<h3>Paris Liberation Anniversary</h3>
<p>Soviet Foreign Minister Participates in Celebration</p>
<p>[Reuters Paris, 25th] The Hotel de Ville today celebrated the second anniversary of the liberation of Paris. U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes and Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov also attended. However, after Molotov warmly shook hands with French Foreign Minister Bidault, he left before Bidault gave his speech. According to a United Press report, the reason may have been seating arrangements, as the delegations of the United States, Britain, China, and France were seated in the front row, while the Soviet Union and Ukraine were seated in the second row.</p>
<h3>Nile River Flood</h3>
<p>[Reuters Cairo, 25th] In the village of Karlbi, upstream on the Nile, one thousand five hundred houses were destroyed overnight due to a sudden rise in the river.

<h3>Indian Viceroy Arrives in Calcutta for Inspection; Riots Break Out Again in New Delhi; Several Suspects in the Attack on Arman Khan Arrested</h3>
<p>[Comprehensive Report from Our Newspaper] According to a United Press report, Indian Viceroy Wavell arrived in Calcutta by plane on the 26th and immediately began inspecting the areas affected by the Hindu-Muslim clashes last week. According to an Agence France-Presse dispatch from London, riots broke out again in New Delhi on the 25th, resulting in two deaths and seventy-one injuries. At the same time, after Arman Khan, a member of the Indian Interim Government, was shot and injured by rioters yesterday, the police have arrested several suspects. Arman Khan is of the same religion as Muslims but is not a member of the Muslim League. The Muslim League has refused to participate in the government, and it is possible that Arman Khan was targeted for this reason.</p>
<p>Allocation of Positions in the New Indian Cabinet</p>
<p>Reuters New Delhi: The Indian Interim Government will take office on September 2nd. New cabinet members are expected to arrive here in succession within days, at which time the allocation of positions can be decided.

Of the twelve announced, seven were previously listed in the list announced by the Viceroy on June 16th.</p>
<p>Muslim League Firmly Refuses to Cooperate</p>
<p>After Viceroy Wavell delivered a radio address on the 24th, calling on the Muslim League to join the Interim Government and cooperate, Muslim League President Jinnah issued a statement of two thousand words on the 25th, calling Wavell's speech "inaccurate." There is no sign of improvement in Hindu-Muslim cooperation.</p>
<h3>U.S. Pacific Coast Seamen Brewing Strike Wave</h3>
<p>[United Press San Francisco, 25th] The U.S. Labor Federation of Seamen, because the Wage Stabilization Board refused to increase wages, is scheduled to convene a meeting of seamen from various ports on the Pacific coast tomorrow night, which may decide to strike to protest. According to Pacific Coast Seamen's Union Secretary Lundeberg, this strike will affect both the east and west coasts. The union had negotiated with employers for a monthly wage increase of $27.50. Since the board has rejected this, we are no longer obligated, and anything can happen after this.</p>

<h3>Paradise in Antarctica; Scientists to Explore</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse London, 26th] The first Antarctic scientific expedition after the war is about to depart. Its purpose is to explore the "Queen Maud Land" mountain range, located 350 miles from the South Pole. This area is a paradise, without ice and snow, and green year-round, buried in the Antarctic continent. This territory belongs to Norway, but so far, only a German expedition once surveyed it from the air in 1939 without landing. Since then, no one has paid attention to it. The expedition includes several British and Norwegian scientists, and Swedish scientist Ahlmann is also among them. The group will travel by the latest aircraft, equipped with radar equipment.</p>
<h3>China and India Join Hands; Element of Far Eastern Peace; New York University Professor Publishes Paper</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper New York, 25th] New York University Professor of International Affairs and Indian scholar Taraknath Das published a paper in the New York Times today entitled "Cooperation between Britain, America, China, and India is a Necessary Condition for World Peace and Progress." In the article, Das strongly argued for the significant influence of Chinese culture and politics on India, saying, "The division of China under the pretext of promoting peace may be cited as a precedent for the division of India and Pakistan." The article also pointed out, "The Soviet Union is currently adopting a policy of gradually splitting China and establishing puppet governments in various places." He said, "Indian leaders such as Nehru support the Chinese National Government. Indian leaders do not support the division of China into two regions, one communist and one national government. They believe that China should only have a national government free from external influence." Therefore, the author urged the U.S. authorities to explain their China policy to the Indian people through Chinese and American spokespersons. He said, "Friends of the Soviet Union in the United States have already used Indian newspapers to spread anti-American sentiment about China in India."</p>
<h3>International Court Judge Determines Puyi Was a Puppet; Treasonous Treaty Contained Four Key Points; Defense Continues to Intensify Cross-Examination</h3>
<p>[Remodelling Society Tokyo, 26th] Puyi, the puppet emperor of Manchukuo, has testified in the International Court for a week and was finally determined to be a puppet by the presiding judge today. The defense continued to question. Kiyose first asked Puyi whether he had proposed two conditions when he took office as "Head of State": (1) to implement politics on a trial basis for two years, and (2) if the trial results violated the expectations of 30 million people, he would resign. Puyi replied that this was the case. He was also asked whether he had handed the "contract" to Commander Honjo before taking office as "Chief Executive." Kiyose immediately presented documentary evidence.</p>
<p>Puyi replied that he was confused last week and did not know it was this document. He said that this document was entirely from the Kwantung Army and was unconditionally accepted under the pressure of the Kwantung Army at the time. Kiyose then asked whether the "edict" issued after Puyi's first visit to Japan was of his own volition. Puyi replied that he had never instructed the issuance of such an edict, and that everything was controlled by Lieutenant General Yoshioka at the time. Kiyose also presented the book "Record of Accompanying the Visit" by Hayashi, reciting the poems made by Puyi in it. Puyi replied that these poems were just diplomatic language. He also said that Yoshioka came to Japan as a member of the Kwantung Army headquarters. Kiyose then asked about</p>
<p>the religious situation in Manchukuo.</p>
<p>Puyi replied that Yoshioka had said that religions other than shrines would be abolished and forced the military and schools to set up shrines. Kiyose then asked whether Puyi's wife was poisoned to death or killed due to insufficient glucose. Puyi repeated what he had said last time and said that based on the surrounding circumstances, he judged that his wife was poisoned. After the above questions and answers, the presiding judge finally declared: "We have decided that this witness is a puppet. Continuing the cross-examination is a waste of time." However, Kiyose continued to question: "Did you not issue an edict on December 8, 1941, saying that you would give full support to Japan?" He replied, "This matter was also said by the Japanese side." He asked, "On August 20, 1945, when the witness flew to Shenyang Airport, did you say to the 'Commander-in-Chief of Security' Inaba Torao: I am grateful to the Japanese 'Emperor' and people, but</p>
<p>nothing can be as you wish</p>
<p>?" He replied, "I don't know this person." Next, the defense attorney Okamoto presented the book "Twilight in the Forbidden City" by Puyi's teacher Johnston, asking Puyi whether the "Xuantong Imperial Salt" stamp on the preface of the book was Puyi's. Puyi was evasive, and after being reprimanded by the presiding judge, he said, "The name was signed by Zheng Xiaoxu, and the imperial listen was because Zheng Xiaoxu possessed it without authorization, so I don't know the details." Okamoto wanted to determine that it was Puyi's, and language adjudicator Major Muar said, "The witness is saying: The writing is not my writing, and although the seal is mine, I don't know if it's mine." Prosecutor Keenan expressed dissatisfaction with this, saying, "Colonel Muar does not understand Chinese." Colonel Muar then said, "Once Orientals are accused of saying something wrong, they want to avoid answering." Our prosecutor angrily stated that this sentence insulted Orientals, and as a result,</p>
<p>Colonel Muar apologized</p>
<p>to settle the matter. Okamoto then continued to question, and Puyi confessed: "There are about two hundred seals, but it seems to be used by Zheng Xiaoxu and Luo Zhenyu, but I have not given them the right to use them. Although the seal on the preface of the book written by Johnston is mine, I don't know when it was used. Also, although there is no error in the affairs of Peiping mentioned in the book, I have never lived with the author in Tianjin, and I am not responsible for what he said." He asked, "Who appointed Zheng Xiaoxu as the Prime Minister of 'Manchukuo'?" He replied, "It was decided by Commander Honjo first and then shown to me." He asked, "The witness repeatedly said to recover the lost land, who recovered it after all?" He replied, "China." He asked, "In 1931, did you hope for Sino-Japanese cooperation?" He replied, "There is no such thing." He asked, "Do you know that the Japanese government was originally passive about the Northeast Incident?" He replied, "The Japanese government's actions and words are always inconsistent."</p>
<p>Contents of the Treasonous Treaty</p>
<p>[United Press Tokyo, 26th] Puppet Emperor Puyi continued to testify in the International Court today, admitting that he had signed a treasonous treaty with the Kwantung Army. The original text of the treaty was presented by Kiyose, the defender of Tojo, and was signed before Puyi took office as puppet emperor. The main points are as follows: (1) The authority to defend and enforce laws in Manchukuo is transferred to Japan; (2) Existing ports, waterways, railways, and highways are managed by Japan, and Japan can open new ports for national defense purposes; (3) Manchukuo must provide all assistance to equipment deemed necessary by the Japanese army; (4) Japanese people with vision and insight should be appointed as state advisors; (5) The above four articles are the basis for future treaties between Japan and Manchukuo. Kiyose spent a lot of time making Puyi admit that he had issued a statement of Sino-Japanese friendship when he visited Tokyo. Puyi argued that this statement was suggested by the Director-General of the General Affairs Bureau of Manchukuo and was not of his own volition.</p>

<h3>New Developments in the Bureau of Railways Embezzlement Case; Yu Xiangyan Suddenly Turns Herself In; Escorted to the District Prosecutor's Office for Overnight Interrogation; Startling Revelations: "Director Chen Extorted Five Million Yuan; Police Department Embezzled Seven Million Yuan in Stolen Money"</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Two months ago, a 120 million yuan embezzlement case occurred in the Materials Department of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway Administration. The main culprit, Zhang Hongtu, the Director of the Materials Department, and 17 of his staff were arrested by the Police Department of the Bureau of Railways on the afternoon of June 25th. After interrogation, it was discovered that Zhang's wife, Yu Xiangyan, was also a major suspect, but she had already disappeared. The Police Department ordered its subordinates and sent letters to various military and police agencies in the city to jointly arrest her, but after two months, there was still no trace of her. On one hand, the Police Department of the Bureau of Railways transferred the captured one thousand suspects to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation, but because the case involved many businesses, the interrogation was troublesome, and because Yu Xiangyan was still delayed in turning herself in, the investigation has not yet been completed.</p>
<p>After the case occurred, our newspaper received two letters from Yu Xiangyan, defending her husband as much as possible, claiming that Director Chen Bozhuang knew about the matter in advance, and even seemed to imply that Chen was complicit in the embezzlement. She also claimed that she was suffering from illness and would turn herself in immediately after she recovered slightly, requesting that the truth be investigated according to law to avoid being falsely accused, etc. However, more than two months have passed since the case occurred, and Yu has not been seen turning herself in. According to Li Weiguang, the director of the Weiguang Hospital in the city, Yu Xiangyan is deeply addicted to drugs and needs to smoke five points of morphine every day. She went to the hospital to quit drugs, but disappeared after the case occurred.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, at 10 p.m. the night before last, Yu Xiangyan, who had been missing for two months, suddenly appeared and went to Director Chen Bozhuang's residence on Bailinan Road. At that time, Director Chen was still working at the Bureau of Railways and had not returned home. His family telegraphed Chen, who ordered the Police Department to send police to bring Yu back to the Bureau of Railways. After detailed interrogation, she was handed over to the Police Department Detention Center for detention. At 7:30 p.m. last night, Cai Zhenbang, the chief of the Judicial Section of the Police Department, sent four police officers to transfer Yu to the District Prosecutor's Office along with the case file. Quan Tao, the prosecutor of the District Prosecutor's Office in charge of the case, opened the court for interrogation at 9 p.m. that night and ordered her detention after the investigation.</p>
<p>Yu wore a black Xiangyun yarn cheongsam, white socks, and black satin embroidered shoes. She was in good spirits and told reporters that she had returned to Songjiang to recuperate after the case occurred. She had returned to Shanghai for more than 20 days and had met with Director Chen three times. She was detained on the evening of the 25th for the third time. She said that Director Chen had extorted 5 million yuan from Zhang Hongtu, and she had solid evidence of this and would file a lawsuit with the court according to law. After the case occurred, Zhang Bokang, the chief of the procurement section, turned over more than 10 million yuan in stolen money, but the Police Department only handed over 3 million yuan to the court, and the remaining 7 million yuan was used and embezzled by the staff of the department. The District Prosecutor's Office will investigate the case in detail in the coming days, and the truth will be revealed soon.</p>

<h3>The Mystery of the Guisheng Steamer's Voyage</h3>
<p>IWO officials say they have been approved to sail once more; Customs Administration replies to the Steamer Industry Association that clearance is not allowed.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] According to IWO officials who informed reporters yesterday, the Guisheng Steamer was carrying relief supplies from Hong Kong to Qingdao, Tianjin, and Shanghai, along with passengers and cargo. After arriving in Shanghai, it was opposed by the Chinese shipping industry, which sent a telegram to the customs to prohibit customs clearance. The company sent personnel to Beijing last Saturday to request understanding from the relevant authorities, which has been granted. However, it is only allowed once, and will not be repeated. It is said that the steamer is scheduled to leave Shanghai tomorrow afternoon and head north. It is feared that foreign ships will no longer be able to load cargo and passengers in Shanghai for northern ports.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] The Shanghai Steamer Industry Association, having learned that the British-owned IWO's Guisheng Steamer was loading cargo and scheduled to sail to Tianjin on the 27th, telegraphed the Chief of the Executive Yuan's Shanghai Office and the Customs Administration of the Ministry of Finance yesterday afternoon, ordering them to stop it and not allow customs clearance. They received the following reply from the Customs Administration last night: "To Director Du of the Shanghai Steamer Industry Commercial Guild, your telegram has been received. Regarding the IWO's Guisheng Steamer loading cargo and preparing for customs clearance today, it has been investigated and confirmed. The Jianghai Customs requested approval for the transportation due to the UNRRA's shipped materials. The Customs officials misunderstood the new regulations stipulated by the Yuan's order, thinking it was still within the scope of approval. We have ordered the customs to correct this and not allow the steamer to clear customs. This is a reply for your information, Customs Administration of the Ministry of Finance, Wei Qin."</p>

<h3>Lin Kanghou's Trial Concluded Yesterday; Sentencing Scheduled for the Morning of the 31st of This Month</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The case of Lin Kanghou's suspected treason was continued to be heard by the High Court's collegial panel yesterday morning at 11:30 am. It lasted for over an hour and has been concluded after arguments. Sentencing is scheduled for the morning of the 31st of this month. According to the indictment of the High Procuratorate, Lin was captured by the enemy in Hong Kong after the Pacific War broke out in the 30th year. He was escorted to Shanghai along with Li Sihao and others. In the 32nd year, he became a director of the puppet National Commercial Control Association. In the 33rd year, when Wen Lan-ting served as the chairman of the puppet Commercial Control Association, Lin also served as the secretary-general of the association. At the same time, he served as a member of the puppet Shanghai Municipal Advisory Committee, secretary-general of the Banking Industry Association, supervisor of the puppet Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and chairman of the American Chemical Factory. The indictment of the High Procuratorate stated that the factory supplied alcohol to the enemy, amounting to as much as 1,000 gallons per day.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Lin wore a dark blue, fine wool upper garment and gray western pants, with glasses on his nose, and was in good spirits. He stated: "I have served society for decades. I have always been loyal to the country and have not dared to falter. After Hong Kong fell, I was forced by the enemy to return to Shanghai. Among the puppet positions I held, my position as director and secretary-general of the puppet Commercial Control Association was to help my old friend Wen Lan-ting handle affairs. I had been serving as the secretary-general of the Banking Association before the war. The position as a member of the puppet Municipal Advisory Committee was designated and forced upon me by the then puppet mayor Chen Gongbo. As for the matter of the American Chemical Factory supplying alcohol to the enemy, I was not aware of it and cannot be held responsible. The predecessor of the factory was the Hequn Alcohol Factory, which was reorganized in the 28th year to establish the American Chemical Factory. At that time, I was in Hong Kong and was not familiar with its business. It was not until I was escorted to Shanghai in the 30th year that I became the chairman, and even that was not voluntary. During my tenure in the puppet Commercial Control Association, I never collected any materials for the enemy. Instead, I used my authority to collect over 100,000 pieces of cotton yarn, which I presented to the government after the victory. If I wanted to be a traitor, I would not have gone to Hong Kong that year, and it would not have been difficult to become a mayor in the puppet government. The fact that I was wanted by the puppet government in the 29th year shows my true intentions." The defense lawyers yesterday were Jiang Yiping and Fu Kuanglin.</p>
<p>Yu Hualong</p>
<p>The deputy director of the puppet Shanghai Municipal Baojia Autonomy Preparatory Committee, currently 53 years old and from Fenghua, was also tried by the collegial panel yesterday. Yu stated: "Due to the frequent bomb attacks in various parts of the Public Concession at that time, the enemy puppets sealed off the areas where incidents occurred, which led to the establishment of the Baojia organization. My appointment was also out of compulsion, and it was also very convenient for the citizens." Yu Hualong was originally a lawyer, so yesterday in court, he cited legal provisions and did his best to defend himself, asking for a verdict of not guilty. The case is also scheduled to be sentenced on the 31st.</p>

<h3>Huang Zhuan and Others Interrogated Yesterday</h3>
<p>On the same day, the cases of Huang Zhuan, chairman of the puppet Bamboo Industry Association; Feng Guanfu, translator of the enemy Dagong Textile Mill; Liu Bin, translator of the Ningbo puppet Township Police Joint Association; Huang Zhifang, acting director of the Zhennan Security Brigade's Resident Ningbo Office and adjutant of the Zhenbei Defense Regiment; Sun Liangui, staff member of the Zhennan Security Brigade; and Cai Tingbang, Taiwanese translator of the enemy Ningbo Gendarmerie, were examined. Witnesses were summoned to court for detailed inquiries, and all were postponed for further interrogation.</p>
<h3>Retrial of Yuan Shixiang and Chen Huichang</h3>
<p>Furthermore, the case of Yuan Shixiang, manager of the former Laodahua Ballroom, and Chen Huichang, manager of the Venus Cafe, who were accused of treason by the Jew, Li Wei, was previously concluded by the High Court, which deemed that it lacked jurisdiction and transferred it to the Shanghai District Court for trial. The prosecutor refused to accept the verdict and appealed to the Supreme Court, which ordered a retrial. Yesterday afternoon, the court reopened and summoned witnesses such as Zhou A Liang, a tea server at the Laodahua Ballroom, for questioning. The case was adjourned for further interrogation.</p>
<h3>Better Change Careers Early; "Daban's" Petition Disappoints</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] More than 200 "Daban" dance hostesses from the 48 dance halls in the city that were ordered to be dismissed went to the Labor Department of the Social Affairs Bureau at 10:00 a.m. yesterday in four trucks to petition. Director Zhao refused to meet them, saying that these people were neither employers nor employees, but parasites on society, and had nothing to do with the Labor Department. Thereupon, the "Daban" sent eight representatives to see Director Wu. Because Director Wu was away on official business, Deputy Director Li received them. The reason given by the representatives was: "The existence of dance hostess Daban is actually beneficial to the country, because it can promote the dance industry and increase national tax revenue." They also said, "If the system is not good, it can be improved. A complete ban will cut off people's livelihoods, so please ask the Social Affairs Bureau to ask the Police Department to withdraw its order." Deputy Director Li said that their words were unreasonable, and the Social Affairs Bureau absolutely agreed with the Police Department's measures, so he advised the "Daban" to quickly change careers. If they still wanted to work in dance halls, they would have to change their positions. The Social Affairs Bureau could convene the dance hall authorities to persuade them to give them priority in employment. The eight representatives, seeing that it was difficult to reverse the situation, quickly left.</p>
<h3>Military Court President Takes Office Today; Personnel Changes; Slight Personnel Adjustments</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] After Liu Shifang resigned and went abroad, the position of President of the Military Court of the First Pacification Zone has been vacant for nearly two months. Although Judge Lu Qi has been acting as president, due to many difficulties, the work of the Military Court has almost been suspended for two months. The new president was already internally appointed. It is concurrently held by Li Liang, President of the Civil Division of the High Court. However, President Li has been too busy with the affairs of the Civil Division, and he also teaches at several universities, so he has been resigning. Recently, due to Commander Li's repeated urging, he has finally decided to reluctantly take on this part-time job and will officially take office today.</p>
<p>He repeatedly told reporters that his abilities are weak, and the trial work of the Civil Division of the High Court is almost concentrated on him alone. Now that he is splitting his time to concurrently serve as President of the Military Court, he is afraid that it will not be easy to do well, but he said that he will try his best. From September 1st, the court will resume full-day office hours, at which time he plans to hold court at the High Court in the morning and then go to the Military Court in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Regarding personnel adjustments, President Li said that, in addition to Lu Qi remaining in office, Qu Ze Zeng, Jiang Baoli, and Jiang Baolian have all resigned. Among the two prosecutors, Lin Wopeng will continue to work, and Gu Yongquan has also resigned. As for the clerks, almost all have left and been replaced. In addition to sending Zhang Shijie, a judge from the High Court, to concurrently serve as a judge, and transferring his capable subordinate Li Yechu to serve as Chief Clerk, the remaining vacant positions will have to wait for Director Liu of the Military Law Department of the Pacification Zone to come to Shanghai for consultation before a decision can be made.</p>
<h3>Huang Xianggu and Sun Yaodong Each Sentenced to Seven Years' Imprisonment</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The High Court yesterday announced verdicts in five cases of suspected treason: Huang Xianggu, director of the puppet Social Simple Insurance Bureau, and Sun Yaodong, general manager of the puppet Fuxing Bank, were each sentenced to seven years' imprisonment and deprived of civil rights for seven years. Secret agents Huang Jieting and Zheng Chengxue were each sentenced to two years and six months' imprisonment and deprived of civil rights for three years. In addition, the postman Fan Rixin, who was previously accused of passing messages on behalf of the White Russian secret agents Dao Shi and Tao Ci brothers of the puppet Secret Service Headquarters, killing our underground worker Chen Sancai, was declared innocent due to lack of conclusive evidence.</p>
<h3>The Deceased Cannot Testify; Former Hardoon Employee Requests Retirement Pay</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Fifty-nine old employees of the Hardoon Foreign Firm who were dismissed in batches starting in April of the 33rd year of the Republic recently applied for mediation to the Labor Department of the Social Affairs Bureau, stating that Hardoon and Madame Luo Jialing had verbally bequeathed that all old employees who had served for a long time could receive 500,000 yuan in retirement pay according to "custom". According to the 500,000 yuan at the time of retirement, the current legal currency should be worth 7.44 million yuan. However, the foreign firm only agreed to give three months' retirement pay, totaling less than 1 million yuan. The Social Affairs Bureau believes that the verbal will is unfounded and cannot be established. However, since each employee has served for more than ten years, it seems appropriate to give them retirement pay after retirement. The amount of retirement pay is currently being mediated by the Social Affairs Bureau. If both parties insist, the Social Affairs Bureau will reject it and transfer it to the court for handling.</p>
<h3>Twenty-Three Nazi Spies; Ohlhaver and Others Initially Tried Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Twenty-three German war criminals, including Ohlhaver, were given an initial investigation by the U.S. Military Tribunal yesterday. At 9:00 a.m., the seats in the gallery were already full. The twenty-three defendants sat in three rows. The leader, Ohlhaver, was the first person on the left in the first row. His head was already half bald, with a slight frown. He wore glasses, and his tall stature was a clear comparison to the short stature of his subordinate Skanski, who was sitting next to him. The puppet ambassador, Warmann, sat in the eighth position in the first row, his expression still trying to maintain his ambassadorial demeanor. The first person in the second row was Hess, who had lobbied our Guangxi generals. He had a shaved head and thick eyebrows, and his eye sockets were deep-set. The Consul of Guangzhou, Siebert, had white hair all over his head, and the Consul of Shanghai, Renthe, sat in the first and eighth positions in the back row, respectively. All the prisoners wore U.S. military khaki uniforms and looked natural.</p>
<p>In addition to the appointed Lieutenant Colonel Lau Yau-chung and Lieutenant Colonel Paul Ding, the defense bench included five lawyers hired by the defendants themselves: Yang Linzhi, Jiang Yiping, Qian Naiwen, Yao Zhaodi, and Plaime. After the chief prosecutor, Lieutenant Colonel O'Connor, read the indictment, the court asked each prisoner whether he pleaded guilty. Starting with Ohlhaver, all twenty-three Nazi war criminals stood up and loudly replied "Not guilty".</p>
<p>The court then asked the defense whether they had any objections to the opening of the case. The chief defense counsel, Lieutenant Colonel Lao Youzhong, stood up and said: "Only three weeks have passed between the filing of the public prosecution and the opening of the court today. The defendants' preparation work is not sufficient, so we request a postponement of the formal trial." Lawyer Yang Linzhi, on behalf of his clients Ohlhaver, Renthe, Haiboni, and others, submitted a protest against the U.S. Military Tribunal's jurisdiction to try the Germans in China, listing thirteen reasons. After the panel deliberated for five minutes, the presiding officer, Colonel Mellon, declared: "The protest against the court's trial of the case is rejected. The case is adjourned for three weeks and is scheduled to reopen on September 16." (The left picture shows the prisoners on trial.)</p>
<h3>Disposition of Traitor Property; Includes Original Property</h3>
<p>Regarding the provision in the Regulations on the Suppression of Traitors concerning the confiscation of traitors' property, the scope of the confiscation has not been specified in detail, making it difficult for the Enemy Property Management Bureau to handle. The bureau recently received a resolution from the Executive Yuan transferred by the Judicial Yuan for a unified interpretation of laws and regulations, stating that the property to be confiscated includes all property obtained from the crime of treason, as well as other original property, and is not limited to property obtained from traitorous acts. Except for property that belongs to the public, should be recovered, or should be returned to the victims, all should be confiscated.</p>

<h3>Tampering with Milk Powder Trademarks; Criminal Prosecution</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Lin Songnian, a 40-year-old Ningbo native, works at the Scientific Instrument Hall at No. 406 Fuzhou Road. On the 20th, he purchased eighty cases of "Cow Butter Cup" milk powder (24 cans per case, 1 pound each) newly shipped from the American "Ronnie" factory to Shanghai from Chen Munian (who is engaged in import and export business and lives at No. 103 Chongqing Road). Because the packaging of the milk powder was not good, sales were not high, so Lin entrusted his friend Wang Zongkang (43-year-old Suzhou native, living at No. 154, Baoyuan Lane, No. 400 Jiangning Road) to completely remove the trademarks and text from the outside of the cans, intending to print the Scientific Instrument Hall's own brand. Wang first removed the trademarks from more than 20 cases of milk powder, but had not yet printed the new brand. The day before yesterday (the 24th), Wang's housemate, Zhou Yiliang, reported him to the Jiangning Sub-bureau in charge. Chen Kaizhou, the chief of the Criminal Division, ordered the police to investigate and found that it was true. He arrested Lin Songnian and Wang Zongkang and interrogated them on charges of obstructing agriculture, industry, and commerce, violating criminal law, and planned to submit them to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation within a few days.</p>
<h3>Young Woman Hides Firearms</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Penglai sub-bureau of the Nanshi Police Department received a tip-off last night that Gong Lanhua, a young woman living at No. 14 Changming Lane, Wanyu Wharf, Dongjiadu, was hiding a large number of firearms at home. They ordered Han Jian, the patrolling officer of the Dongjiadu Police Station in charge, to lead a large number of police officers to surround the area. As a result, two shell guns, one revolver, and 160 rounds of ammunition were found. Wang Lanhua and apprentices Wan Zhenyuan and Li Hongnian were taken to the bureau for interrogation along with the guns and ammunition.</p>
<h3>Tax Officials Solicit Bribes; Investigated</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Direct Tax Bureau recently reported that Zeng Keguang and Lin Fu'an, tax officials of the bureau's Hunan Office, were using their positions to solicit bribes from shops in the Yangshuo Street and Nanqiao Street areas.

The officials have been escorted to the Hunan Inspection Office of the Garrison Headquarters and transferred to the court for investigation.</p>
<h3>Inside Story of the Woolen Felt Order Dispute</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Chiang Lu-tang, General Manager of the Huaying Enterprise Company at No. 40 Hong Kong Road, accused Kinzburg, a Jewish manager of the Lianying Company, of issuing bad checks in return for refunds. Details were reported in yesterday's newspaper. According to Kinzburg, he told reporters that in February of this year, Huaying Enterprise Company and his company signed a contract for him to order 1,000 rolls of oil felt from the United States. After the two parties signed the contract, the plaintiff delayed payment for as long as five weeks. At that time, there was a labor strike in the American woolen mill, and soon the American government banned the export of the goods, which delayed delivery. However, when the two parties signed the contract, it was stated that "This company is not responsible for any labor strikes or export bans in the United States." However, in order to settle the matter, he repeatedly negotiated with the plaintiff, voluntarily agreeing to return the payment and provide reasonable compensation. Unexpectedly, Chiang unreasonably threatened him, so he had to stop payment. It is now heard that since the plaintiff has filed a lawsuit, the defendant is also preparing to file a counterclaim.</p>

<h3>Zhai Xu, a Student of Zhongzheng Middle School, Wins the First Prize of This Newspaper; Returns Full of Prizes</h3>
<p>This newspaper's joint gift-giving event for major factories, shops, and companies has the special gifts for July and the winning numbers were published in yesterday's newspaper. The first prize number is 105040, and the winner is Zhai Xu (see picture), who lives at No. 35, Yuguo New Village, Yuyuan Road. At 9:00 a.m. yesterday, he took a pedicab to the museum to collect his prize. He won more than 20 famous clothes, including glass shoes, a children's raincoat, a jeep suit, and a youth suit, worth more than 1 million yuan. Mr. Huo is 17 years old and a junior in Zhongzheng Middle School. He felt very happy to receive this unexpected harvest and returned full of prizes. Before leaving, he told reporters: "My family, young and old, are old readers of Shen Bao. Although I am young, I have five years of newspaper reading experience. At first, I only looked at pictures and photos, and gradually paid attention to the content. I read it roughly and understood some current affairs. After Shen Bao gloriously resumed publication last year, it has been wonderful. From the first page to the twelfth page, each has its own advantages. I always read the paper before getting up every morning, and then get dressed and go to school. It has become a habit. If I don't read it for a day, I feel like I have lost something. Today, I am very grateful to Shen Bao and the major manufacturers for giving me many valuable gifts. My parents looked at the newspaper early this morning and compared the numbers. They were very happy to win the first prize. I am from Qufu, Shandong, the hometown of the Supreme Sage Confucius. Tomorrow is the birthday of the Holy Saint and Teacher's Day. I think the only way to respect Confucius is to read more books by sages and worthies to cultivate my personality and faithfully serve society and the country."</p>
<h3>Cruel and Stupid Act: Throwing a Sick Baby to Death</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Tan Guangchang, a 32-year-old man from Suqian who lives at No. 9 Fu'an Lane, Zhangjiabang, Nanshi, married Lu Min ten years ago. They had a son after more than two years, who died at the age of two or three. They continued to have children, but they also died of illness. On the 24th of this month, they had another baby boy, who was white and lovely. The child began to have chills and fever yesterday afternoon. By dusk, the symptoms became severe and he was dying. Knowing that he could not be saved, Lu scolded the debt collector non-stop. Tan then threw the child out of the window and into the street. He then went outside and slapped the child's cheeks twice, and the child died. Neighbors watched and were outraged, so they reported it to the Taishan Police Department, which ordered the police to rush to the scene and arrest Tan. According to current law, it is a crime to abandon a person who is unable to save themselves or to kill one's own children.</p>

<h3>Dai Ailian's Profound Expressions and Smiling Frontier Dances</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper] Dai Ailian's dance performance was held last night at the Yi Yuan Theatre. The program included "Forest Maiden Kacha," "Gleaner Girl," "Homesick Tune," "Baan's Children," "Spring Outing," "Yao People's Drum," "Jiarong Wine Party," "The Mute Carrying the Madwoman," "Kanseer Khan," and "Youth Dance," encompassing the most popular local folk dances from Xinjiang, Xikang, Tibet, Sichuan, and other frontier regions. Among them, "Kanseer Khan" and "The Mute Carrying the Madwoman" were the most outstanding, earning the most applause. "Kanseer Khan" is a love song about a girl and a coachman from Dabancheng in Xinjiang, with a quiet dance style and profound expressions. "The Mute Carrying the Madwoman" depicts a mute old man with a long beard carrying a crazy and paralyzed woman (played by Huan Ailian), performing various actions. Dai Ailian's achievements in dance are extraordinary. A wave of her fan, a strike of her drum, all are skillful and beautiful. Joy, fear, shyness, longing, admiring herself in a mirror, picking flowers, wiping sweat—all her expressions and movements evoke a sense of intimacy. The members of the Shanghai Symphony Orchestra were all smiles. Zhao Zukang, the Director of the Public Works Bureau, and his wife, who were sitting behind the reporter, repeatedly cheered. Dai Ailian's dance performance lacks the liveliness of "Ballet," but it is more intimate than "Ballet"; it lacks the melodiousness of opera, but it is more flavorful than opera. Because it is purely "our own thing."</p>
<p>After the performance, the reporter conducted a relatively detailed interview with Ms. Dai. According to Ms. Dai, "I have loved being active since I was a child, and I became interested in dance at the age of five. I formally started learning from a teacher at the age of twelve. In the past few years, I have come into contact with the ethnic groups in the southwestern and northwestern frontiers and discovered extremely rich material for local folk dances. Most of these folk dances have been influenced by ancient Han people. For example, the Tibetan 'Jumping Guo Zhuang' and 'Jumping Zizi' fully retain the legacy of the Tang Dynasty. By learning from these materials, I hope to create a path for Chinese national dance forms besides stage plays."</p>
<p>"I have been away from England for almost six years. During these six years, the art of dance in the world has been progressing every day. I have been secluded in the rear for so long that I have almost lost touch with the entire dance world. This time I go abroad, first of all, I must re-establish contact with this circle. Secondly, I want to introduce Chinese folk dances to the American stage. Thirdly, many of my classmates from England have gone to the United States and have already achieved great success, and I am eager to see them. Fourthly, I have not been home for fifteen years, so I can take this opportunity to see my old father in the West Indies. I will probably return to China in a year to continue studying folk dance."</p>

<h3>Peking University Freshmen Will Go North Soon</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Peking University admitted a total of 123 freshmen in the Shanghai area. Except for a few freshmen who have already taken a ship north, the majority have not yet left Shanghai. Recently, the "Peking University Shanghai Freshmen Going North Association" was established. In addition to sending a letter to Beiping requesting the university to arrange for ships to go north, they also requested the Peking University Alumni Association to provide full assistance. Wang Qinwang, the executive secretary of the Peking University Shanghai Alumni Association, has been working hard to find a solution. He has negotiated with China Merchants Steam Navigation Company for approximately 80 cabin berths on the "Hai Xia" ship. According to China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, the "Hai Xia" ship has already carried students from the Southwest Associated University to the north for repatriation. It will return to Shanghai within a week and will stay in Shanghai for a few days before sailing to Tianjin again. There are also students from Beiyang University who will take this ship to the north for repatriation. If there are no temporary obstacles, the trip can be made within ten days.

<h3>Municipal Education Bureau Orders Private Schools to Reduce Parents' Burden as Much as Possible</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau recently issued an order to all private schools, stating: "Since the Anti-Japanese War, private primary and secondary schools in the city have steadfastly maintained their positions and worked hard to support themselves, and their enthusiasm for maintaining education is highly commendable. For the sake of local education, the Bureau should encourage and assist them to maintain their current state so that the teachers' lives are not in dire straits. Therefore, it is excusable for the schools to collect higher fees in order to maintain operations. However, at a time when people's livelihoods are declining, increasing the burden on parents may cause impoverished students to drop out of school. The Bureau has carefully studied this issue and deeply feels that maintaining private schools and preventing young people from dropping out of school should be considered concurrently. Private schools should uphold their original intention of persevering in maintaining education and recognize the state's intention of promoting education. They should reduce the burden on parents as much as possible. All fees payable by students must be collected in at least two installments. The number of tuition-free places for students must be at least 20% of the total number of students in the school, so that children from poor families can still have the opportunity to attend school. All of the above points must be strictly followed."</p>
<h3>Decision on Distribution Method for Educational Loans</h3>

In addition, there are detailed regulations regarding the investigation and visits to students' families.</p>
<h3>China Institute in America in New York Repeatedly Raises Funds to Support Chinese Students Studying Abroad</h3>
<p>[New York Shipping News] The China Institute in America in New York, in cooperation with the governments of China and the United States, raised funds during the war to subsidize financially struggling students studying abroad, allowing them to study with peace of mind and avoid excessive economic pressure. In the past five years, nearly a thousand Chinese students studying abroad have benefited from this assistance, and the achievements have been remarkable. With the end of the war, various scholarships were discontinued one after another. Considering that some students studying abroad could complete their studies soon, but their funding was not secured, causing panic in their academic life, and many years of dedicated research may be in vain, the association has consulted with various parties for assistance. Fortunately, it has recently obtained the consent of the Chinese Wartime Academic Planning Committee to allocate the remaining funds for the use of subsidizing a small number of students studying abroad. It is reported that students applying for assistance must have studied in the United States for one year and have studied full-time in the United States. Applicants must also fill out an application form with the China Institute in America, submit supporting documents, and provide definitive proof that they can complete their studies within the next six months. The applicant's academic transcript and thesis outline must also be submitted at the same time. It is reported that the application deadline for this partial scholarship is August 31st of this year.</p>

<p>Civil Affairs Briefs</p>
<h3>Municipal Government Civil Affairs Department Investigates the Situation of Families of Soldiers on Active Duty to Provide a Basis for Universal Preferential Treatment</h3>
<p>The Municipal Government's Civil Affairs Department, considering that this city was previously occupied by enemy forces, and families of soldiers on active duty either fled to the interior or were trapped in occupied areas, resulting in potential oversights in preferential treatment, and now that various places have been recovered, families of soldiers on active duty or veterans and their families, regardless of whether they have recently moved to this city, should be thoroughly investigated to provide a basis for the universal implementation of preferential treatment, has, in accordance with regulations, drafted an investigation form. On the 27th of this month, the municipal government issued an order to the district offices, summoning the heads of each Bao (neighborhood unit) to explain the form and conduct the investigation by Bao, ensuring that no one is missed. The deadline for completion and reporting is September 10th.</p>
<h3>The 16th Bao of the 26th District Requests the Withdrawal of the Xinzhuang Police Station</h3>
<p>A Telegram Reported to the Municipal Government Requests the Jiangsu Province to Instruct Them to Handle the Matter</p>
<p>The 16th Bao (Neighborhood) of the 26th District (Longhua) reports that the Songjiang County Police Bureau established a police station in Xinzhuang within their Bao, forcibly requiring businesses to register, which violates the original intention of temporarily maintaining the status quo until the demarcation line agreed upon by the province and the city is clarified. Therefore, the Bao reported to the District, which then reported to the Municipal Government, requesting the Jiangsu Provincial Government to swiftly order the Songjiang Police Bureau to withdraw the Xinzhuang police station. Furthermore, in Xinzhuang, the Xinzhuang Office of Songjiang County has sent personnel to paste Songjiang Jiangsu household plaques on each household and posted notices stating that this year's land tax, military rations, and autonomous household donations in Xinzhuang should also be collected on schedule like other places, causing widespread anxiety among the people. The Bao head has already reported the matter to the District Office, which has forwarded it to the Municipal Government for review.</p>
<h3>Review of the Work of the Old Tangqiao District Bao Heads in the 30th District</h3>
<p>Zhang Longsheng and others, the Bao heads of the nine Bao in the old Tangqiao District of the 29th District in Pudong, held a work review yesterday (the 25th) at the Bao Office of the 18th Bao in Nanmatou and hosted a banquet for Liu Ding, the head of the 29th District, and Qi Peiran, the chief of the police sub-bureau. Local gentry Wang Jifu, Gao Songfu, and Zhao Rubi, along with the nine Bao heads, totaling more than 20 people, attended. During the banquet, Chief Qi, District Head Liu, and Director Shen of the People's Education Experimental District, Long, and others gave brief reports on the general situation of police administration, civil administration, and education, and the Bao heads provided suggestions for improvement. The event concluded in a joyful atmosphere.</p>
<h3>The 17th District Raises Funds for Local Education - Appoints Members to Organize a Committee</h3>
<p>The 17th District (North Sichuan Road) has only five public and private primary schools in the entire district, causing many school-age children to be unable to attend school due to the lack of schools (there are more than 5,000 out-of-school children in the district). The District Office has repeatedly appealed to the education authorities and has been approved to establish Qingyun Primary School at the former site of the Municipal Zhabei Experimental Primary School on Qingyun Road. However, the school buildings were previously occupied by the enemy and severely damaged, and all school equipment is gone. With the start of the school year approaching, the funds for repairs and purchases are still unsettled. Therefore, local people enthusiastic about education have initiated the organization of a Fundraising Committee for Local Education Funds, with city councilors residing in the district and the heads of each Bao as members of the committee, to raise funds. In addition to supporting Qingyun Primary School, the funds will be used to establish additional primary schools, and a volunteer accountant will be hired to audit the donations, income, and expenditures, which will be publicized at any time. The list of all committee members was submitted by the District Office to the Municipal Government for approval yesterday.</p>
<h3>Wei Qingyun Resigns Concurrent Post</h3>
<p>The 14th District (Zhabei) Office recently approved a letter from the District People's Representative Assembly stating that Representative Wei Qingyun had written to the assembly stating that, according to law, District People's Representatives and City Councilors cannot hold concurrent positions, and therefore specifically requested to resign from the position of District People's Representative. It was hoped that this would be approved and a replacement would be appointed to strengthen district administration. Since District Office People's Representative Wei Qingyun had resigned, Xu Weixin, who received the next highest number of votes, should be appointed as a replacement according to law. The matter was reported to the Municipal Government for approval yesterday.</p>
<h3>Q&amp;A on Doubts Regarding Household Registration Regulations (Continued)</h3>
<p>(43) Question: Mr. A has his original household registration in County A, but has obtained temporary household registration in County B. If Mr. A's family members from his original household registration (such as his mother, wife, etc.) move into Mr. A's temporary household registration, can they obtain temporary household registration from the date of their move, or should they apply for temporary residence? Who should be the head of the household? Answer: The acquisition of temporary household registration has specific conditions stipulated in Article 5 of the Household Registration Law. When family members of someone who has already obtained temporary household registration move into the household, they can only apply for temporary residence. Before fulfilling the legal conditions, they cannot immediately obtain temporary household registration. Mr. A will still be the head of the household.</p>
<h3>Provisional Measures for Issuing National Identification Cards</h3>
<p>(Article 1) These measures are formulated in accordance with Article 11 of the Household Registration Law and Articles 28 to 32 of the Implementing Rules of the Household Registration Law.</p>

<h3>Spinning and Construction Did Not Increase Prices, the Black Market Rebounded Sharply Yesterday - Huge Profits from Reselling Lead to a Surge in Applications - Hoping That Private Factories Will Adopt the Same Measures</h3>
<p>[Reported by this Newspaper] Yesterday, the yarn market suffered from a shortage of supply from major yarn factories. Furthermore, a responsible person from China Textile Corporation stated last Sunday that they would implement price increases regardless of social criticism. This stimulated the market and, after opening, the prices of all grades of cotton yarn rose in a straight line amid a buying frenzy. 20-count yarn rose by 100,000 yuan. 32 and 42-count yarn rose by 200,000 yuan, setting a new record after the exchange rate adjustment. However, at noon, the Spinning and Construction Company posted its price list, continuing to allocate sales as usual, and the price also remained unchanged. It was also reported that Shenxin Yarn Factory distributed double horse, heavenly maiden, and red man brands to the industry yesterday. Although the prices were slightly lower than the black market prices, they had already risen by more than 20% compared to the selling prices before the exchange rate adjustment.</p>
<p>The reporter then interviewed the authorities of the Spinning and Construction Company to inquire about the company's allocation situation and opinions on curbing the rampant cotton yarn black market. According to the response: After the exchange rate adjustment, the cost of raw cotton used by various yarn factories, most of which is sourced from overseas, has undoubtedly increased. However, the spinning and construction authorities have always maintained the original price allocation before the exchange rate adjustment and have not changed the allocation quantity. However, after the exchange rate adjustment last week, cotton yarn market prices rose, and applications for purchases flocked in. The number of applications was exceptionally large. Spinning and Construction continued to allocate according to the usual quantity. It is estimated that each day last Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, 2,000 to 3,000 pieces of cotton yarn of various counts were allocated. As for yesterday's situation, there were as many as 4,000 application forms. If each form applied for 20 packages, that would be a total of over 80,000 packages. This huge demand is obviously inappropriate. In terms of Spinning and Construction's allocation price, it currently remains unchanged. For example, the allocation price for 20-count Blue Phoenix is 1.16 million yuan per piece, while the black market price yesterday was 1.5 million yuan. The allocation price for 42-count Blue Phoenix is 1.9 million yuan per piece, while the black market price yesterday was 2.46 million yuan. Those who receive the allocated goods immediately make huge profits by reselling them. Therefore, applicants come one after another. The Spinning and Construction authorities, as a state-owned enterprise, are still painstakingly maintaining the original price. It is hoped that private yarn factories will not be pessimistic and will work hard to cooperate with Spinning and Construction to stabilize banknote prices. It is estimated that the various factories affiliated with Spinning and Construction in this city currently produce about 600 pieces of yarn per day. The total production of private yarn factories is also similar. Therefore, if they can unite and jointly maintain the yarn market, the black market will definitely not be so rampant. Otherwise, relying solely on Spinning and Construction to maintain low prices will only result in a few yarn merchants profiting, without actually benefiting general consumers.</p>
<h3>Minister Wang Calls Yarn Factory Representatives to Discuss the Cotton Yarn Supply Problem</h3>
<p>With the prices of yarn and cloth rising sharply in recent days, the China Textile Corporation held its eighth board meeting the day before yesterday. The directors debated for a very long time on whether to adjust the allocation price of China Textile Corporation and reduce the difference between the allocation price and the black market price. As a result, the allocation price was not changed in principle. The specific implementation methods were handed over to the Textile Industry Management Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs for research and decision. It is learned that Minister of Economic Affairs Wang Yunwu, in addition to presiding over the China Textile Corporation's board meeting, also held a symposium on the cotton yarn supply problem at the office of the special commissioner of the Ministry of Economic Affairs yesterday morning at 10:00 AM. Those who were called to attend included Zhang Zi, the special commissioner of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, Wu Weijing, the deputy general manager of China Textile Corporation, Guo Dihua of Yong'an Yarn Factory, Rong Hongyuan of Quxin Yarn Factory, Wu Kunsheng of Shenjiu, Tong Kuofu of Xinyu, and Wang Qizi, etc. Presided over by Minister Wang, the quantity and price of cotton yarn supplied by various yarn factories were discussed in detail. It is hoped that the private yarn factories will assist the government in suppressing cotton yarn prices.</p>
<h3>Cloth Prices Rise in Unison</h3>
<p>The cloth market continues to rise, and the price increase is becoming more intense. This is because sales in other ports have expanded, and partly because spot goods are tight. The market is continuing to rise and increase. Gray cloth and cheap cloth have strong upward momentum. However, the Spinning and Construction Company allocates goods as usual, but the public is still enthusiastic. As a result, the prices of various grades of cloth have risen by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. Tomorrow is Confucius' birthday, and the market will be closed.</p>
<h3>Overbought Positions Emerge; Unified Bonds Gradually Decline</h3>
<p>After various sectors expressed their opinions on pre-war debt, all kinds of extravagant hopes were diluted again, and overbought positions were sold off one after another. At the opening of Unified Bond C this morning, it inherited the lingering momentum from last Saturday, pushing it up to around 2,100 yuan. However, it was soon suppressed by selling pressure and gradually declined. At one point, the low price reached 1,600 yuan before stabilizing. At noon, it struggled above 1,650 yuan. As a result, A, B, and C bonds each fell by more than 200 yuan compared to the previous close, while D and E bonds fell by 180 yuan.</p>
<h3>Gold and Banknotes Rise</h3>
<p>The spot market continued to weaken yesterday. There was still pressure at high prices, and it did not break out of the consolidation pattern. In the morning, it was pulled up to 2.17 million yuan due to small silver houses covering their positions. After the opening, it rose to 2.18 million yuan before supply appeared, forcing it downstream. After 10:00 AM, it occasionally reached 2.16 million yuan, and the Central Bank allocated 150 bars at this price. After that, it stagnated. At noon, it was still hovering around 2.165 million yuan. In the afternoon, the Guangdong banking sector slightly increased, showing a slight increase. As a result, it was 10,000 yuan higher than last Saturday. Ornaments and silver were flat. Silver coins were in demand. Due to the approaching end of the month, the interest rate on private loans was high, ranging from 1.2 to 1.5 jiao, and even more than 1.8 jiao outside the market.</p>
<p>Foreign currencies were stable and unchanged. The U.S. dollar opened at 3,400 yuan to 3,420 yuan this morning. After the opening, it slightly fell to within 3,400 yuan and then became mediocre, struggling around 3,390 yuan until noon. In the afternoon, it showed a slight improvement. As a result, it was slightly higher than last Saturday by 10 yuan. Hong Kong tickets were stable and remained around 750 yuan. As a result, they were slightly higher than last Saturday by 10 yuan. The Hong Kong exchange rate had sellers at 750 yuan. The U.S. exchange rate still stood at the listed price. The British exchange rate was 12,000 yuan, and the Indian exchange rate was 910 yuan, all of which had sellers, but buyers were not excited, and transactions were limited.</p>
<h3>The Tea Market is Booming; Holders are Reluctant to Sell</h3>
<p>The domestic sales of black and green tea, except for Tianjin, which is relatively sluggish, are still constantly surging in other places. The process is exceptionally solid. As for the foreign tea market, the attention is focused on the tight trend of fine red tea in India. Because the supply and inventory are both exhausted, transactions are ultimately lacking. However, at present, in order to meet the urgent needs, the industry has temporarily substituted Hao Men fragrant tea and coarse red tea for the shortage. Therefore, the transaction of these two styles has been quite prosperous in recent days, and the selling price is also like a horse out of its reins. Other goods such as Fujian red tea, Qimen red tea, Chenchou Zhen, Chenzhen Mei, etc., are constantly being absorbed by exporters, and the market atmosphere is like a hurricane following closely behind. It is reported that Jardine Matheson and Shanghai Union have a preference for Chenzhong Qimen, and are willing to welcome them at a price of 100,000 to 120,000 yuan per dan. However, recently, the holders' minds have been unusually profitable, and they are reluctant to sell lightly, all holding a wait-and-see attitude.</p>
<p>Shanghai Import and Export Statistics for July</p>
<p>According to the customs publication, the total value of Shanghai's import and export goods for July of this year is as follows (unit: thousands of yuan):</p>
<p>The import goods in July were still dominated by cotton, followed by oils, fats, candles, and soaps, and then cotton textiles and Western medicines and chemicals. The export goods were dominated by raw silk, followed by leather, and then tung oil.</p>
<h3>The Market is Closed Today for Confucius' Birthday</h3>
<p>Today (the 27th) is Confucius' birthday. Businesses in this city, from the financial sector to major markets, stores, and factories, are all closed for one day as usual. All agencies are also closed for the holiday. However, the post office's office hours are the same as on Sundays.</p>
<h3>The Source of New Rice is Gradually Booming; Japonica and Indica Trends are Peaceful</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the total registration of rice arriving at the North and South markets was about 4,000 shi, mainly new goods. There were supplies from Nanjing, Liyang, and Jiaxing. The source of new japonica rice from Pudong is also abundant. However, there is very little old japonica rice and less white yuan, so old japonica rice is strong, new japonica rice is high and cheap, and white yuan is a rare commodity, soaring by 5,000 to 6,000 yuan. Both new and old indica rice are showing a peaceful trend. Foreign rice is allocated, totaling more than 17,000 bags in the North and South markets. Flour factories have not opened up much, and retail sales are very high, with supply not meeting demand. The outside price has risen by 100 to 200 yuan. Foreign flour is also showing a strong trend. Bran is continuously consumed in rural areas. Wheat is turning active in the north. The supply from various inland routes is scarce. Fujian and Yong have also taken a liking. The high-grade goods have risen by 500 to 600 yuan, while the middle and low grades are fair. The arrival of yellow soybeans is still weak, and consumption is also sluggish, continuing to fall by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. The high-grade broad beans have risen by 500 to 600 yuan. The Guangdong banking sector's liking for raw kernels is still acceptable, gradually increasing by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. The supply of oil to the market is slightly scarce, and consumption is lively. The situation is again trending towards supply falling short of demand, and prices have risen by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Bean cake continues to be slightly lower by 100 to 200 yuan, and Tianjin cake is slightly lower by 400 to 500 yuan.</p>
<h3>Appropriating Enemy and Puppet Cloth to Exchange for Sugar and Coal from Taiwan Province</h3>
<p>The Total Value of Delivered Goods Exceeds 1.3 Billion Yuan</p>
<p>Previously, the government authorities instructed the Spinning and Construction Company to appropriate the enemy and puppet cloth received by the Disposal Bureau and hand it over to the Taiwan Trade Bureau to exchange for sugar and coal from Taiwan Province to be transported to the Disposal Bureau for barter. Since taking on the business, the Spinning and Construction Company has handed over cloth worth 1,082.32 million yuan. It is learned that recently, another 136 pieces of cloth, totaling 45,099 bolts, including bleached government cloth, twill, coarse twill, black cloth, and yellow khaki, etc., worth a total of 240.4693 million yuan, have been handed over. The two totals are more than 1,322.7893 million yuan. The last batch has been successively received by the Shanghai Office of the Taiwan Trade Bureau.</p>
<h3>The Number of Deposits in Commercial Banks and Zhuang in This City at the End of July</h3>
<p>The Financial Inspection Office of the Central Bank published the commercial banks and Zhuang deposits in Shanghai this year. As of the end of July, the total was 149,132,525,748.78 yuan. The deposit reserve paid to the Central Bank was 29,495,451,343.24 yuan. Among the deposits, current deposits accounted for 145,504,755,000.80 yuan, and fixed deposits only accounted for 12,627,770,747.99 yuan.</p>
<h3>The Asphalt Price Increase is Not Weakening</h3>
<p>The bottom line for asphalt in various places is weak, the hot weather has not subsided, and transportation is inconvenient, resulting in a daily decrease in sources. However, candle manufacturing will all start to surge. The usual amount is in high demand, and the difference between supply and demand is too far. Zhejiang oil has repeatedly telegraphed price increases. According to yesterday's statistics, the internal Ping oil must be 100,230 yuan, and the oil for variable transportation is 98,000 yuan. Hankou reported that the Bin city oil has moisture and must be 74,500 yuan. It is sold upon arrival, without any accumulation. The Shanghai market relies entirely on two sources, which is so short of goods that the impact is not light. Therefore, the Jiaxing Benz oil is a rare commodity. It is heard that the place of origin has been sold to outside 110,000 to 120,000 yuan. The wholesale of He Benz oil in Shanghai is 128,000 yuan, the internal Benz oil is 115,000 yuan, the sharp oil is 112,000 yuan, the Qian oil is 110,000 yuan, the Shuanglian Lan oil is 107,800 yuan, and the Macheng oil is 100,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>The Lack of Sugar is Getting Tighter and Tighter</h3>
<p>The Guild Hall Has Not Yet Opened</p>
<p>Recently, although there have been continued arrivals of Shantou Gang sugar, the goods have not yet been put on the shelves, resulting in a tight shortage of spot goods. The opening price has been tight and not relaxed. The price of Gongfenbai has been between 164,000 yuan and 150,000 yuan for the past few days. Xingchi is 40,000 yuan, Youchi is 145,000 yuan, and the price of sugar last Saturday was 115,000 to 6,000 yuan. The market rose again by 5,000 to 6,000 yuan yesterday. A total of 600 to 700 pieces were traded within 32 days, entirely direct transactions between businesses. The guild hall has not yet opened.</p>
<h3>After the Foreign Exchange Adjustment, the Export of White Tung Oil Gradually Opens Up, but the Source is Scarce and Difficult to Supply</h3>
<p>Since the change in foreign exchange, the foreign trade of white tung oil has indeed been accessible. A small number of transactions have already taken place the day before yesterday. The cost is US$0.33 per pound, and the delivery to the dock in a fast bucket is between 115,000 yuan per net weight. After this adjustment, it may be possible to export it steadily in the future. After the seven or eight years of war, the loss of tung trees in various producing areas is indeed not small. The output is no longer comparable to that before the war, and the number of oils used for lighting before the arrival of kerosene in poor rural areas is also considerable. Although the export quantity has decreased and even been destroyed, there is no large accumulation in the producing areas. Even if the price of oil is raised, the source is still scarce. Although exports are accessible, it is feared that the supply will be difficult to be smooth. The devastation of the products after the chaos is not just one item of tung oil. The wholesale and retail sales of each family in Shanghai are the same, and the estimated price is 115,000 yuan per unit, and the summer sales will be reduced to a decree, only a scattered embellishment.</p>
<p>Hongjiang tung oil will inevitably increase in cost in the future after the white tung oil rises. When the current value is sold, the command cannot be extrapolated from this, and the stock is quite thick, only slightly added, to show sympathy. The current price of each brand of Xifu is 85,000 yuan.</p>
<p>(Another message) The selling price of London tung oil is 275 pounds per ton at the dock for users (including commission), which seems to have increased compared to the previous 230 pounds. The above pound price is equivalent to 155,375 yuan per unit of national currency. Today, the full amount of tung oil in the Shanghai market is still less made, and both buyers and sellers seem to still have a wait-and-see attitude, and the price is unchanged from last Saturday.</p>
<h3>Kerosene Has Indeed Increased in Price; Gasoline Will Also Increase Accordingly; Gas Stations Claim to Be Sold Out</h3>
<p>[Reported by this Newspaper] After the exchange rate adjustment, the cost of liquid fuels such as foreign kerosene and gasoline has also increased. In recent days, although the gasoline at gas stations has maintained the original price, which is 750 yuan per gallon, the supply has been slightly limited. Yesterday, some gas stations even claimed to be sold out and refused to add gasoline. As for kerosene, most stores have increased the price from 200 yuan to 300 yuan per catty. The reporter inquired about this matter with Mobil Oil Company yesterday. According to the company, the price of the company's brand new listening and bulk kerosene has indeed changed slightly since the exchange rate was called. The Shanghai delivery price for each pair of brand new products (a total of 10 gallons in two listening) was originally 13,250 yuan, and now it is 22,100 yuan, or 2,210 yuan per gallon. In addition, the ex-warehouse delivery price in Pudong for every 10 gallons of bulk kerosene was originally 8,500 yuan, and is now 14,000 yuan, which is 1,400 yuan per gallon. The adjustment of gasoline prices is currently under consideration. It is said that the adjustment of kerosene and gasoline prices by various American gasoline companies is roughly the same.</p>
<h3>Export Tax Exemption; Tianjin Bristles Rise</h3>
<p>[Tianjin, 25th Telegraph] Tianjin's pig bristle exports were once suspended due to poor quality. Later, the New York market still had a strong demand for Chinese pig bristles, so the market became active and exports increased. Since the government announced the exemption of export tax on the 19th and changed the U.S. exchange rate ratio, pig bristles have risen, and the transaction has been very successful. The market price this month, the improved 55-box set of goods, is 15,800 yuan per catty, the 50-box set of goods is 35,200 yuan per catty, and the 43-box set of goods is 18,500 yuan per catty, which is about 50% higher than before May. There is still a possibility of continued increase in the future.</p>
<h3>The Opening Period of the Securities Exchange is Approaching; Bargain Stocks Are in Great Demand; Matching Transactions Will Be Made Until the 28th</h3>
<p>Because the counterparty matching company in the Chinese stock industry will implement the actual transaction until the 28th, the multi-empty chips will inevitably be straightened, and they will be confused. However, because the securities exchange will be reopened soon, the major buying power from the bargain stocks is more than enough, and Mei Ya's status is still strong, and Yong Yarn has a forced short squeeze trend. Therefore, the initial opening is still stable, and the low price is reported one or two gears lower, but it is not easy to obtain. As soon as the bargain is opened, it will be expensive, and the morale is revitalized and revitalized. The various stocks are gradually prospering, and the high price is shown in the middle. Then the market is transformed, but the closing is low and high again. As a result, Yong Yarn and Mei Ya each rose by nearly half, Jingfu was flat, and Xin Guangqinxing rose slightly. The medium-sized stocks were about 10% weaker, and the small stocks rose by 10% to 15%. The veteran stocks also increased by 10% to 20%. After the noon market, the amount of yarn in the outside market suddenly increased and the short squeeze was very strong, and the asking price was increased to 730 yuan.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks are still led by Western merchants who choose low prices to invest, leading the price increase. Hot stocks have lost their color. Yisha has been raised from 8,700 yuan to 9,300 yuan, British United has risen from 9,700 yuan to 10,400 yuan, Yipi has been well organized from 2,050 yuan to 2,225 yuan, and Asia has risen from 1,800 yuan to 1,950 yuan. The situation is extremely strong and abnormal. As a result, Yisha, British United and Yiguang each rose by nearly half compared with last Saturday, while Huidexte, Steel, Asia, Yipi and Paper each rose by about 10%.</p>
<h3>30,000 Bags of Rice Stored by the Ministry of Grain Were Transported from Jiujiang Yesterday</h3>
<p>30,000 bags of rice stored by the Ministry of Food were shipped from Jiujiang to Shanghai by the Xin Yingping, an agent of the China Merchants Bureau, and arrived yesterday to regulate the local food supply.</p>
<h3>The Order to Purchase Raw Silk has Arrived in Shanghai</h3>
<p>It is confirmed that the government's order to purchase raw silk has arrived in Shanghai and is being handled by the Commodity Exchange Office of the Central Trust Bureau. As for the previous rumor that it would be jointly purchased by the China Silk Company, it was a misunderstanding. A director of the China Silk Company has denied it. As for the detailed methods and various procedures for the purchase, it will be announced within three days.</p>
<h3>Recruiting Bureau's Zhongkai Ship Exports: Freight Rates Break Records; Large Quantities of Relief Goods Arrive in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Shunheng Foreign Company, managed by Finkler Fulei, brought 9,090 bales of cotton and 19,268 packages of old clothes and shoes from Boston on the ship "Meihaosi Dun." The ship also contained over 930 barrels of tallow, 3,170 blocks of lead, 270 blocks of steel plate, and over 1,120 packages of soda ash. It arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning and unloaded at floating docks number three and four. Furthermore, the company's "Luosifan'er" ship also arrived yesterday afternoon, carrying over 8,330 railway sleepers for the Ministry of Communications, 2,000 bags of flour, 4,700 pieces of lumber, and 2,150 boxes of canned food. It also contained over 14,000 boxes of "Shui Ye" (possibly a type of drink). Although today is Confucius' birthday, the ship continued unloading cargo as usual because it contained "Shui Cai" (presumably a type of perishable food). In addition, the Taikoo Blue Funnel Line's "Samson" ship arrived yesterday evening, carrying 8,135 tons of wheat from Australia, all for relief.</p>
<p>Exports included large quantities of cotton yarn and cotton cloth destined for Guangdong. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's "Zhongkai" ship sailed directly to Guangzhou yesterday afternoon, carrying 2,000 tons of cotton yarn and cloth, approximately over 6,000 pieces, plus 600 tons of general merchandise. It is said that the ship's export freight rates broke the company's post-restoration record for each voyage.</p>
<h3>Diamond Sales Boom: A Result of Inflation</h3>
<p>[United Press, Cape Town, 25th] Due to fears of inflation and news from the United States regarding changes to price control measures, the diamond trade in South Africa is now experiencing another boom. Many diamonds are being exported because people in Europe and the United States fear inflation and the devaluation of currency, and are therefore buying diamonds as a form of savings. At the same time, refugees from Europe and the Far East, unable to exchange large amounts of foreign currency before returning home, are also buying diamonds to carry with them.</p>
<h3>Fresh Pig Intestines Double in Price: Traders Plan to Unify Purchases</h3>
<p>After the foreign exchange rate adjustment, overseas casing prices have decreased slightly, but the price of fresh pig intestines in Shanghai has skyrocketed. Each set now costs between 800 and 900 yuan, almost 100% increase than before the increase. There is much criticism among traders towards those involved in acquisitions. It is rumored that the traders will convene a meeting soon, and they may form a cooperative for unified purchasing in order to standardize acquisition prices.</p>
<h3>Xing Four Yuan (Silver Coins) Rise by 10-20%</h3>
<p>Xinghua Four Yuan coins are scarce and the prices of miscellaneous goods have risen by 40,000-50,000 yuan. As a result, the asking price has increased. The current market asking price has risen by 10-20%.</p>
<h3>Correction</h3>
<p>In yesterday's news about the establishment of the Vegetable Vendors' Exchange, the commission taken by the brokers from the cargo owners was mistakenly printed as 30%. It should be 10%. We hereby correct this error.</p>
<h3>Silver and Money Industry Reserve Association to be Established on September 2nd; Valuation Committee to Assess Assets; Three Banks and Two Bureaus Decide Not to Participate</h3>
<p>The Silver and Money Industry Joint Reserve Association, which has been in preparation for a long time, has already recruited all business firms and trust companies as members since the work began. Foreign banks, except for Citibank Chase, which requested to retain its membership, must first consult with their head offices. The reason for the delay in convening the members' meeting was to wait for the final decision on whether the three banks and two bureaus would participate. Now that the three banks and two bureaus have been instructed by the Joint Treasury of the Four Banks to withdraw from joining, the Preparatory Committee has decided to hold an establishment meeting at 3:00 PM on the 2nd of next month at the Bankers' Association. At that time, various firms and trust companies will send representatives to participate and elect seven executive committee members, who will then elect three standing committee members and a chairman from among themselves. The chairman will be stationed at the association to preside over its affairs. After the members sign the articles of association, the Valuation Committee will be established. The committee will consist of nine to eleven members, with three executive committee members as ex officio members. The Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank will each send one representative, and the remaining members will be experts in stocks, goods, and real estate. The committee will review the reserve assets submitted by the members and issue treasury bills at 70% of the market value, which may total around 20 billion yuan. The reserve assets will be kept in full custody by the Central Bank.</p>

<h3>August in Xi'an</h3>
<p>— Xi'an Airmail Report on the 22nd. Special Correspondent: Li Chi</p>
<p>While important figures from Nanjing and Shanghai are traveling to Kuling and Lu Shan to escape the heat, Xi'an has already passed the peak of summer. This summer, as predicted by meteorologists, the temperature is generally lower than average due to solar flare activity. The average temperature difference between Kuling/Lu Shan and Nanjing/Shanghai in summer is only about ten degrees.</p>
<p>Total Number of University Applicants Expected to Exceed 6,000</p>
<p>The autumn sky is clear and the air is crisp, and the season for studying is approaching. This year, the National Northwestern University has moved back to Xi'an, and part of the National Northwestern Institute of Technology is also located in the city (with the other part in Xianyang). As a result, there are many more applicants in the city recently. In addition, National Central University, Peiyang University, Fu Jen Catholic University, and Lanzhou University are also recruiting new students in Shaanxi. Despite the many opportunities to apply, they are still not enough for the large number of applicants. As early as this time last year, some students who dropped out of school during the war predicted that this year's applications would be difficult due to the large number of people and the limited number of places. In addition, transportation is still not smooth, so many students who originally wanted to study in Beijing, Tianjin, Nanjing, or Shanghai have no choice but to change their plans and temporarily apply for admission here.</p>
<p>According to the figures released by the authorities of each school, the ratio of applicants to enrollment places has reached more than one hundred to one in some colleges, and the difficulty can be imagined. It is estimated that the number of high school graduates applying to various universities this autumn will exceed 6,000, while the total number of admitted students will be less than 1,000, and nearly half of these places will be reserved for demobilized youth soldiers. Taking the Northwestern University as an example: there are more than 2,000 applicants, but there are only 260 places, of which 70 must be reserved for youth soldiers and 20 for those recommended by the National Frontier College.</p>
<p>Students Desperate, Educational Circles Planning to Establish "Night University"</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, thousands of high school graduates will "sigh at the door" of various universities this autumn. Should they be solely responsible for their dropped-out education? No, of course not. The Shaanxi branch of the Kuomintang has telegraphed the Central Government and the Ministry of Education, asking them to instruct the Northwestern universities and colleges to add double classes and double the number of admissions to seek partial remedies. In reality, even if the number of places is increased threefold, there will still be those who "miss out."</p>
<p>Another meaningful proposal is planned by Wang Youzhi, Director of the Shaanxi Provincial Department of Education, and Liu Jihong, President of the Western University. They believe that many young people need to balance their studies and employment, and the establishment of a "Night University" will solve the problems for countless hard-working students. This "Night University" will be established in Xi'an and will offer classes at night, but efforts must be made to ensure that its academic qualifications are recognized by all parties and are no different from those of schools that offer classes during the day.</p>
<p>After "Xi Da" (Northwestern University) moves back to Xi'an from Chenggu, it will increase the academic atmosphere of this ancient city. In Guangxi, "Xi Da" is the abbreviation for Guangxi University, and in Yunnan, some people also refer to "Southwest Associated University" as "Xi Da." The latter and the predecessor of this National Northwestern University, "Northwest Associated University," were wartime "sister universities." In the era of Northwestern University, there were only three colleges: Arts, Science, Law, and Commerce. Later, the Northwestern Medical College merged in, and since then there have been four colleges. (In the past, there were also the College of Agriculture and the College of Education, for a total of six colleges). Furthermore, if you look at the history of university education in our country, there was also a "Northwestern University" more than twenty years ago, but there is no "blood" relationship between the two.</p>
<p>The "Xi Da" campus is not far outside the south of the city, with more than 800 buildings of all sizes. In the past, the "War Cadre Corps" borrowed this campus and trained many young people who were effective on the battlefield during the war. Now, there are still a few troops stationed there, and there is "mutual respect" between the school and the military. The troops sometimes perform old operas and show movies in the evening, and the students also run over to "enjoy the show." The soldiers and the students are like brothers.</p>
<p>The road from Xiao Ximen to the school gate is being repaired, and a school bus is also being prepared to run into the city. A magnificent and antique school gate is planned to be built at the entrance, with the name of the school in golden characters, written by Mr. Yu Youren. Some people say that if "Xi Da" cannot obtain Mr. Yu's calligraphy for the school gate, no one else would dare to write it.</p>
<p>The 335 New Exchange Rate Creates a Tragicomic Scene</p>
<p>Even someone who is completely unrelated to commercial transactions can discover the most sensitive "news nose" by looking at the market quotations that are published daily for merchants, not by fiddling with an abacus, but from another angle.</p>
<p>In the past few days, the market situation in Xi'an has been obviously turbulent. The reasons are probably these:</p>
<p>The first, and the freshest and most stimulating one, is the government's announcement of the "335" new exchange rate. Most people in Xi'an did not know about this new measure until they saw the morning newspaper on the 19th, but the newspaper that day did not publish what the new exchange rate was until the next day (the 20th). It is said that Shanghai announced it at 10:00 AM that day, and some "well-informed people" here learned about it from the radio waves before 11:00 AM. Buying and selling is like warfare, and time, time, victory belongs to those who grasp time. Between those who know first and those who know later, and those who know later and those who don't know, we have seen many tragicomedies. According to rumors, some people made a huge profit that day, with eight or nine "zeros" at the end of the number. Of course, there were also those who lost.</p>
<p>The Bridge is Repaired Here, but the Rails are Torn Up There</p>
<p>The second reason for the turbulence in the Xi'an market is that the Longhai Railway, except for the section near Bian (Kaifeng), has been cut off by the Communist army. The impact of the Communist army's actions is greater than that of the incursion into southern Shaanxi. At the beginning of this month, because the Eighth Bridge between Shaanxi and Luoyang had been repaired, the Railway Bureau was preparing to implement a direct train service between Shaanxi and Luoyang by the end of the month. At that time, transportation operators and general merchants had great expectations. Because the opening of this bridge meant that railway transportation between Xi'an and Shanghai would be smooth, and the freight rates could be greatly reduced. A few days ago (before the Longhai Railway increased its fares), according to the pricing of the transportation company, it cost only 280 yuan per kilogram to transport goods from Shanghai to Zhengzhou, and only about 350 yuan to Luoyang. Based on this, after the entire railway line from Shanghai to Xi'an is opened, the freight rate per kilogram would not exceed 500 yuan. This would certainly be beneficial to general prices. Unfortunately, the bridge was repaired here, but the rails were overturned there, and many beautiful fantasies were shattered.</p>
<p>In recent years, more and more department stores from Shanghai have been transported here, and now that transportation is cut off, although there are large stocks, the prices will naturally rise. Affected by this are cloth, cotton fabrics, sundries, cosmetics, food, cigarettes, and all foreign goods that are transshipped through Shanghai.</p>
<p>The third reason is that the Longhai Railway adjusted its fares from the 16th, increasing passenger fares by 70% (more than 1,300 times higher than before the war!) and freight fares by 30%. "The wool comes from the sheep's back." When transportation costs increase, the selling price naturally increases.</p>
<p>Efforts to Mediate Achieve Results: Only Pushing Cars in the Mud</p>
<p>The 32nd Executive Group arrived in Xi'an at 3:00 PM on the 25th. The six members of the group departed from Laohekou by car at 6:00 AM that day. According to them, since arriving in Laohekou on the 16th, they have tried their best to contact Li Xiannian. The 9th Executive Group stationed in Laohekou has also tried their best, including dropping leaflets and letters from airplanes, but so far there have been no results. The 9th Group is scheduled to fly to Xi'an today. The 32nd Group will wait for the 9th Group to arrive before holding a joint meeting to continue mediation. They will then decide what to do next depending on the situation.</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, the 32nd Group hosted local reporters and gave a talk, explaining that their trip to Shaanxi was ordered by the three-member group in Nanjing to mediate the military conflict on the border between Henan, Hubei, and Shaanxi. They will report back to Nanjing on the progress of the mediation. Colonel White Russell, the American representative, said in a humorous tone, "The results of our efforts have only been to push cars in the mud." It is said that they encountered bad roads due to rain and their car was deeply mired in the mud and could not move forward, so they had to get out of the car to refuel and push it. Colonel White's words may have an underlying meaning.</p>
<h3>Commemorating Confucius' Birthday and Remembering Historical Sites</h3>
<p>Today is the birthday anniversary of the Most Holy Teacher Confucius. We cannot help but recall that Confucius lived in the turbulent Spring and Autumn Period, and played a role in restoring order from chaos, and sought the happiness of human peace. In terms of academics, he did his best to teach, deleted the Book of Songs and the Book of Documents, edited the Records of Rituals, wrote the Spring and Autumn Annals, and praised the Book of Changes. His teachings have not been altered for thousands of years, and are universally applicable. Now that we have reached the first anniversary of victory, the prospects for peace are still promising but elusive, and national construction is eager to proceed but cannot. It is appropriate to follow Confucius, so that the nation can achieve rejuvenation and culture can reach prosperity.</p>
<p>The hometown residence of Confucius is located slightly west of Qufu County. The Dacheng Hall has a height of 7 zhang 8 chi 6 cun, a width of 14 zhang 2 chi 7 cun, and a depth of 8 zhang 4 chi. The stone pillars in the front are all carved with dragons. The tiles are covered with yellow. In front is an open-air platform, surrounded by stone railings, with two layers and twelve steps in the middle and on the left and right. Inside the hall is a shrine to enshrine the divine tablet of the Most Holy, and the statue of the Holy One. Three li north of the county seat, facing the Zhu River and backing the Si River, the Historical Records says: Confucius was buried on the Si River north of the Lu city, and the Holy Tomb is sealed like a horse's back, the mound is one zhang two chi high, and ten steps wide north and south. In front of the tomb are two stone tablets. About ten steps south of the tomb is the tomb of Zisi, the grandson of Confucius, with two stone tablets, one saying "Tomb of Duke Shusheng of Yiguo" and the other saying "Tomb of the Third Generation Ancestor." There are two Weng Zhong in front, which are old objects from the Xuanhe period of the Song Dynasty. The forest on the left and right of the Holy Forest Archway is the forest, and the village in front is said to be Kongli.</p>
<h3>Sketches of Ningbo and Cixi</h3>
<p>— Ningbo Report on the 22nd, Special Correspondent: Chu Yusheng</p>
<p>In Yuyao, we heard that Siming Mountain was a haven for bandits, so we decided to travel to the foot of Siming Mountain. At 7:00 AM, we took a large truck to the highway to the Shushan ferry. After walking a few dozen steps, we arrived at the Shushan ferry. During the enemy-puppet period, many forts were built there. This small ferry was the main route for the enemy-puppet guerrillas and the New Fourth Army to enter and exit during the war. Before our eyes was a large river, the Yao River, which led directly to Ningbo. A river also went vertically, named the Lubu River. We crossed the river to the opposite bank, which was the Lu Tomb Township of Yuyao. The fields along the way were connected to each other, the rice was lush, the trees were very dense, and the farmers were driving their oxen to work in the fields. The water-lifting equipment was lined up along the river bank, and the oxen were strong and clean, which made people feel very excited.</p>
<p>We proceeded along the Lubu River. The trees on the opposite bank stood like screens, and wildflowers showed off their beauty on the river bank, which was the most beautiful scenery in the fields. Several sedan chairs carried people past. These sedan chairs were very well-preserved, with glass windows and fine rattan chairs. I asked the sedan chair carriers why they had such good sedan chairs? He said, "These are prepared for people to get married." This shows the comfort of the local people. I really don't believe that this is an area where bandits roam.</p>
<p>After walking ten li, we arrived at Lubu Township, which is the gateway to Siming Mountain, that is, the foot of Siming Mountain. Siming Mountain is located between seven counties, covering a large area and with a magnificent terrain. Bandits commit crimes in the mountains, and adhere to the idea of "rabbits don't eat grass near their homes," so they often cross the Shushan ferry and roam. Therefore, Lu Tomb and Lu Ao Townships can still be safe and sound. It is said that these bandits look like ordinary people when they are not committing crimes, so it is impossible to distinguish them. We always thought that only seven points of politics and three points of military force could solve the problem smoothly. Only by making the people of Siming Mountain feel that our soldiers are amiable and respectable can we have a successful day in clearing the countryside.</p>
<p>After walking another ten li, we returned to the Shushan ferry, and then from the Shushan ferry to the highway. We drove to Cixi. As we approached Cixi City, we saw a pagoda, which looked very similar to the Leifeng Pagoda. When we arrived at the county seat, there were small roads inside the city, all paved with cement. The degree of destruction of the city by the enemy was lighter than that of Lin'an, Wukang and other counties, but the market was deserted, which made people feel that the vitality after the war was not easy to recover. The total cultivated area of ​​the county is 550,000 mu, and the population before the war was 300,000, but now it is only 260,000. The north produces more cotton, and the rest produces more rice. Mr. Chen Bulei, whose talents are famous in China, Mr. Chen Xunci, a famous historian, and Mr. Chen Xuyu, the editor-in-chief of this newspaper, are all from the west of Cixi. So Cixi can also be said to be a place where talents gather.</p>
<p>People who have traveled around Shanghai all know that the shipping companies that operate are the Sanbei Company. The so-called Sanbei refers to the north of Cixi, the north of Yuyao, and the north of Zhenhai. The late commercial tycoon Mr. Yu Qiaqing is from "Sanbei." The north ends of these three counties are connected together and are close to the ocean, so there is a separate name "Sanbei" as a place name.</p>
<p>Currently, the most serious threat to Cixi is the banditry in Siming Mountain. I heard many local elders say that if the bandits in Siming Mountain cannot be completely eliminated, Cixi will not be safe.</p>
<p>Ningbo City Area</p>
<p>After leaving Cixi, we drove to Ningbo. The road was flat all the way, and the car quickly reached its destination. This is where the five ports were forced to open for trade during the Daoguang period of the Qing Dynasty. The Jiangbei suburb of the city is the former concession, which was managed by the British. Most of the buildings in the city are modern buildings, and the roads are wide. There are also Outer Bund Road, Middle Bund Road, Zhongshan East Road, and Dongdu Road, all with asphalt pavement. It really has the form of a metropolis. Some people emphasize that Ningbo is a modern metropolis because it is adjacent to the East China Sea and only takes ten hours to reach Shanghai. There are seven large-scale factories such as Hefeng Yarn Factory and Taifeng Flour Factory, and more than 30 small factories and yarn factories. The braised bamboo shoots that are sold all over the country are produced by Rusheng Factory here. Even the only metropolis in the country, Shanghai, and the United Kingdom and the United States like to eat braised bamboo shoots. In terms of commerce, there are many money houses and jewelry stores in the Jiangxia Street area, and there are also many northern goods stores. Ningbo-style woodenware is also very famous. Ningbo lacquer is especially famous at home and abroad.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of the Fish Market</p>
<p>In terms of fisheries, there are more than 50 fish shops here. Now it has been reorganized into a fish market, and Shanghai has been designated as the first fish market by the central government, and Ningbo is the second fish market, which has changed the fish shops into brokers. Maintain the relationship between loans and unloading and buying. Now the fish market handles the seafood department and the customs declaration department, and acts as an agent for fishermen's customs declaration procedures. However, the fishermen do not come directly to sell, but after the purchase of ice-fresh ships, they are sold to the market. There are inevitably exploitative elements in this. Moreover, the fish market does not have a cold storage, and it relies entirely on the commercial cold storage company for cold storage. The fish market does not dare to collect more fish, and the fishing boats send them to the cold storage company, which creates another layer of obstacles. As for the organizers of the fish market, the official and commercial sectors are half and half, and the funds all rely on the fish shops to allocate a part for market use, one and a half points for salted fish, and two points for fresh fish, which can generally be maintained and there is still a surplus.</p>
<p>The Reality of Education</p>
<p>The population of the entire county before the war was more than 700,000, and now it is only 500,000. The total area of ​​the county is 551,147 square li, and the arable area is 2,066,799 mu. There is an effective full secondary school in the territory, which is divided into senior and junior high school departments, and was founded by Mr. Chen Bulei. There are more than 700 students. Those who apply to universities are always accepted, so it is famous in the Ningbo area. There are also Yin County Middle School, Ningbo Middle School, Zhedong Middle School, and Yongjiang Women's Middle School, all of which are full secondary schools. Each school has more than 500 students, and there are also Junan Junior High School and Zhengshi Junior High School, with about the same number of students. The school buildings are very good, and the facilities are also complete. The above can all show that it is a county that is qualified, substantial and sound. Therefore, in the years 1926 and 1927, it was established as a city. Later, due to the financial difficulties of the provincial government, the city was changed to a county, but the police station was still directly under the provincial government.</p>
<p>In the eastern area of ​​the territory, there is Dongqian Lake, which covers an area of ​​38,320 mu, which is the main source of farmland water conservancy for Yin County, Fenghua, and Zhenhai counties, benefiting more than 527,000 mu of farmland. The lake is surrounded by mountains, with beautiful scenery and clear lake water. Villages are everywhere, but in recent years, they have become more and more polluted, and reeds have grown everywhere, showing a desolate scene.</p>
<p>Reviving Ningbo</p>
<p>In fact, Ningbo in recent years is far inferior to what it was before. Due to high costs, industries have either closed down or reduced their scale. Due to the dumping of foreign goods and the reduction of purchasing power, commerce is also showing extreme depression. The public prostitutes in Ningbo later had three grades, with 32 first-class prostitutes, 18 second-class prostitutes, and 17 third-class prostitutes. There were 94 first-class prostitutes, 35 second-class prostitutes, and 23 third-class prostitutes. Now they have also increased proportionally.</p>
<p>The museum and library have also been destroyed, and many school buildings of public and private schools have also been damaged. Beggars and vagrants are rampant in the market.</p>
<p>Reviving Ningbo is in the planning and desire of the provincial government and local people. The most important task at present is to develop the fish market in the economic aspect, and then improve the processing and manufacturing of braised bamboo shoots and lacquer. The construction of water conservancy in Dongqian Lake is also an urgent task. In the spiritual aspect, we should promote academic and cultural activities and improve social customs. August 22nd in Ningbo</p>

<h3>Compulsory Sales of Party and National Flags is Clearly Extortion; The Central Propaganda Department Has Repeatedly Ordered Investigation and Prohibition</h3>
<p>We received your newspaper's letter No. 149, regarding the reader's letter reporting that some people in Gaochun and Piaoyong counties are impersonating the Ministry's name to forcibly sell national flags, and requesting investigation and reference, etc., and attaching the original documents. Upon approval of this, the production and sale of national and party flags are only required to comply with the regulations on printing and dyeing colors and sizes. Any merchant can freely operate. This ministry has not granted exclusive rights to anyone, nor has it established a national and party flag sales headquarters and distribution points in various places, and sent people to various places to force people to buy them. This ministry previously reported that some unscrupulous people in Changshu, Wuxi, and other places had impersonated this ministry to solicit wealth, and ordered various places to investigate and prohibit them. On June 12th and 13th of this year, we published an announcement in newspapers in Beijing, Shanghai, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui to solemnly declare this, in order to prevent people from being deceived. Now that we are informed that the same incident has occurred in Gaochun and Piaoshui counties, in addition to sending telegrams to the local party and government agencies to investigate and deal with it strictly, we have returned the original attachments accordingly. Please investigate, and we hope that this letter will be published. Sincerely, Shen Bao Newspaper Office. (Central Propaganda Department, August 24)</p>

<h3>Answering Reader's Legal Questions</h3>
<p>(1) Termination of an Engagement</p>
<p>Jin Dongzhao asks: When I was eighteen, my parents arranged an engagement with a Miss Feng from the same village. I strongly opposed it at the time, but because I was still studying, my parents made all the decisions, and my opposition was ineffective. Now I am twenty-one and want to cancel the engagement, but I am unclear about the legal procedures. I have several questions and would like your lawyer to answer them: (1) Can I terminate an engagement that I did not agree to, and what are the procedures? (2) Can I demand compensation from the other party when terminating the engagement? (3) Is it illegal for me not to attend the wedding? (4) Would I be committing bigamy if I became engaged to someone else?</p>
<p>[Lawyer Zhu Yakui answers] (1) According to Article 972 of the Civil Code, you can argue that the engagement is invalid; (2) You need concrete evidence to claim compensation; (3) According to Article 915 of the Civil Code, an engagement cannot be forcibly enforced; (4) It does not constitute bigamy.</p>
<p>(2) Repairing a House</p>
<p>Lin Xuan asks: In Shanghai, after the rent has increased 140 times, is the repair of the house the responsibility of the landlord or the tenant? For example, if the house is in a low-lying area and is often flooded, causing the floorboards to rot, the cost of replacing them would be enormous for the tenant and beyond their means. Moreover, it would be difficult to take the new floorboards away upon leaving the property. What would be a fair way to handle this? Please advise.</p>
<p>[Lawyer Zhu Yakui answers] Unless there are special circumstances, it should be handled in accordance with Articles 423 and 430 of the Civil Code.</p>
<p>(3) Debt Dispute</p>
<p>Jinmin asks: In the 25th year of the Republic, I borrowed five hundred yuan in legal tender from Mr. Cheng (with a contract). I have been paying interest annually. Now the creditor wants me to repay the debt based on the price of rice at the time of the loan. (1) Does the central government have any laws regarding repaying loans based on price indexes? (2) How much legal tender would be legal to repay now for the original five hundred yuan?</p>
<p>[Lawyer Zhu Yakui answers] It should be handled in accordance with Article 12 of the Supplementary Regulations for Handling Civil Lawsuits after Recovery.</p>
<p>(4) Recovering a House</p>
<p>Ji Yihe asks: I have two legal questions and would like your lawyer to answer them: (1) Is a house sale valid if it was made under duress during the enemy-puppet period? If the original owner wants to recover the property, what procedures should they follow? Has the Enemy-Puppet Property Handling Bureau ever issued an explicit order stating that sales made during the enemy-puppet period can be recovered by the original owner? (2) There is a distinction between security deposits and rental fees. Suppose a house was rented to Mr. A in the 23rd year of the Republic, with a security deposit of only a few hundred yuan. Now the landlord wants to terminate the lease, but the tenant says that the security deposit must be returned based on the current price of rice, which would amount to several million yuan. Is this legal?</p>
<p>[Lawyer Zhu Yakui answers] (1) If there is concrete evidence of coercion, you can request relief from the Enemy-Puppet Property Handling Bureau. (2) It should be handled in accordance with Article 12 of the Supplementary Regulations for Handling Civil Lawsuits after Recovery.</p>

<h3>How to Choose a Good Husband</h3>
<p>— Zou Dangchang</p>
<p>Every young woman (or man) has an ideal, a sweet ideal. An ideal of sweet love, an ideal of suitable and harmonious married life. But when they actually experience it, what they are faced with is always reality. Reality is not as good as the ideal, so suicide, depression, and all kinds of problems arise. In fact, this is the most foolish thing. Because you have too good an ideal, you cannot withstand unexpected blows. Why do you have to be like this! As long as you have identified your goal, and are not changed by the environment or bent by obstacles, then you determine the conditions for your spouse in your heart, and you will never fail. Below are a few conditions, I hope you can really think about them:</p>
<p>1. Clarify the purpose of marriage. The first thing we need to know is that marriage is not for the satisfaction of sexual desire, but many people make this mistake. They mostly think that once a woman gets married, it is like a task has been completed successfully, and then she just needs to be placed there, treated as something to be watched or played with. This is an unacceptable idea.</p>
<p>2. Do you and your partner have the same interests? We can see a very active man who marries a silent woman. The man likes to move around, and his mouth is like a river. Once he starts talking, he can't stop. His interests are multifaceted; but the lady often sits there for one or two hours without saying a word. So the consequences for them can be imagined. During the period of love, one side may be willing to compromise, but once married, if you want to go east, but I want to go west, then the cracks will deepen, and the feelings will deteriorate day by day, and the consequences are truly unspeakable. Exceptions are very few.</p>
<p>3. When choosing your permanent partner from among your boyfriends, you should pay attention to their age. His age is best to be four or five years older than you, because women are very easy to look old. When a woman has her first child, you can find that she has aged a lot invisibly. At the same time, we can also see that when a man and a woman are both forty years old, when they stand together, the woman must look older. So when they go out together, he often feels a little unmatched, so when you choose a friend, you must pay attention to this point.</p>
<p>4. During the period of male and female friendship, most people will never show their true colors. Men with good tempers certainly don't need to be mentioned, but even men with extremely bad tempers and who turn their backs on others will not show any rudeness at that time. He will pretend to be kind and flattering to you in every possible way. If you are not careful, you will fall into his trap, and you will not have time to regret it. Therefore, the longer you are friends with him, the better, because after a long time, the two people become warm, then each person is easy to show their original shape, so you can determine what his temper is like. We often see a couple, during the period of love, he is all kinds of tender, but after marriage, he may beat and kick his wife, and insult her in every possible way.</p>
<p>5. The period between engagement and marriage is a relatively sweet period, but it is best for you to get married within a year and a half. After you are engaged, you must not delay the years and waste your youth. Because once a woman's youth passes, it is not easy to attract men. At the same time, I have also seen many engaged lovers, after being engaged, the two are separated, so the man has another love, and the beautiful marriage is destroyed by a third party, because men are relatively easy to change their minds. Of course, it is also very common for men to change their minds after marriage, but you need to know that you will not want to be separated for a long time after marriage, and after all, he has one more obstacle, and divorce is more difficult than terminating a contract in law.</p>

<h3>Lemon Cake</h3>
<p>— Mo Ping</p>
<p>Let me introduce a exquisite dessert, lemon cake. Now I will write down its method below.</p>
<p>Ingredients: Four ounces of flour, one and a half ounces of celery powder, four ounces of sugar, two eggs, half a peeled lemon.</p>
<p>Method: First crack the eggs into a bowl and mix well with chopsticks. In another large magnetic basin, place the flour, pour the eggs into the magnetic basin, add the celery powder, sugar, and half a peeled lemon (the lemon must be crushed into powder), mix well with your hands. After mixing, take it out and place it on a flat board or table and press it into a large cake shape. Then place it in a pot and steam it for about an hour, then you can take it out of the pot. Then thickly smear milk oil on a baking mold, place it on the stove, and when the iron plate is slightly hot, place the steamed cake on the baking mold, and cover it with a thin tin lid. Bake it for about thirty minutes, and half of the steam contained in the cake will dry. Open the lid and look at it, the flour in the bottom half will be dry and loose; the half near the lid must be wet and sticky. Take another piece of baking iron plate, apply butter once, and cover the cake as a lid. (No need for a thin tin lid) Hold the upper and lower two iron plates with both hands, turn the cake over and bake again, until half an hour has passed, and all the wet steam in the cake is gone, then the cake will be dry, loose and fragrant, and you can take the cake and the iron plate and place it. After it has cooled thoroughly, use a knife to cut it into squares. Its taste is sweet and delicious, and it is both loose and fragrant. It is most suitable for gifts.</p>
<h3>Things Young Women Should Know When Making Friends</h3>
<p>— Ai Juan</p>
<p>(1) Maintain your dignity and avoid frivolous behavior, especially towards new and unfamiliar members of the opposite sex.</p>
<p>(2) If a new male acquaintance sends you a cheesy love letter, asks you to go to the movies, or go dancing, he must have bad intentions. You should pay special attention to him, and if necessary, resolutely break off the relationship.</p>
<p>(3) You should have the courage to turn your back on those who are malicious and behave improperly. Consider the requests of boyfriends carefully, and have the courage to refuse him and not be afraid to offend him. Otherwise, if you agree to everything, he will step by step lead you into his trap.</p>
<p>(4) Do not associate with friends of the same or opposite sex who live a romantic and dissolute life. Those who are near vermilion get stained red, and those who are near ink get stained black. If you fall and lose your footing, and your reputation is ruined, it will be too late to regret it.</p>
<p>(5) Those shiny-haired and shiny-shoed people who chase like mad dogs on the road and in entertainment venues are mostly "troublemakers" and "cheaters". You must not pay attention to them. Their purpose is clearly to deceive women. Those who more politely ask for your name in order to start a conversation are not necessarily gentlemen either. In short, do not pay attention to strangers.</p>
<p>(6) The psychology of men seeking female friends is to use friendship as a pretext to talk about love. None of them just want friendship. Therefore, at the beginning of making friends, you should begin to observe the other person's temperament, character, and knowledge. If you feel that the other person does not meet your standards, but the other person is warmly expressing their love to you, then you should state your true intentions and make them give up this idea and only maintain friendship with you.</p>
<p>(7) If you are already in love or engaged, when going out with other male friends, there should be at least three people, and it is best if one of them is the same sex. This can avoid criticism from interested parties and prevent tragedies caused by suspicion from your lover.</p>
<p>(8) Do not completely abandon your parents and make friends in secret. Especially the person you are in love with, you should at least let your parents know, and listen to their criticism of him as a reference for yourself.</p>

<h3>The Wonderful Use of "One! Two! Three!"</h3>
<p>— Qing</p>
<p>The other day, at my aunt's house, I saw a strange thing happen. When my fifth and sixth cousins were arguing fiercely, suddenly their second elder brother ran over and shouted "One... Two..." as if chanting a spell. Immediately, the two children stopped talking, silently—although they were still pouting—and walked away. Later, in order to understand this matter, I specifically asked my aunt what the reason was. She was kind enough to explain it to me in detail. After listening, I felt that my aunt's method was a wonderful method of child education, and therefore I dare not be selfish, but write it out and offer it to the readers of this column for reference. Below is my aunt's conversation.</p>
<p>When a group of children—especially those under ten years old—are playing happily, it is not easy to suddenly stop their activities, unless you use harsh words or scolding, or even beatings to be effective. However, harsh words, scolding, and beatings are not allowed by child educators, and they do hinder the development of children's physical and mental health.</p>
<p>I remember about fourteen or fifteen years ago, my eldest daughter was only eleven or twelve years old. One day, four children were playing a game of tag, running from upstairs to downstairs, from the courtyard to the room. At that time, I was writing an article and had to stop their game; so I called them to stop in a kind and pleasant way, but they ignored me. At that time, I originally wanted to use intimidation or scold them, but when I saw those innocent and lovely little faces and cheerful little eyes, I could not bear to be too severe. As a result, I still humbly asked them to come over and listen to me.</p>
<p>At the moment when they walked over, I invented my child education method. I made three rules for them and said amiably; "Now I want to write an article, but you are making too much noise, so I only have this method, first let you play to your heart's content again, and when you have almost played enough, I will shout 'One' aloud, at this time you can still ignore me, but when I shout 'Two', you must be ready to stop, if I shout 'Three', and you do not stop, then I will blame you and punish you. Do you understand?" Probably because of the novelty, they all raised their small hands to show their approval, so I implemented the method as planned. After a dozen minutes, I said "One", and they really ignored me. I was a little suspicious. Fortunately, after seven or eight minutes, I shouted "Two" again, and they all really stopped moving and stopped playing.</p>
<p>From then on, this "One! Two! Three!" became my family law. Later, I had six children, so I gave this comical family law, in front of the six children, gave this power to my eldest daughter and second son, asking their four younger siblings to respect this order.</p>
<p>Regarding this matter, I feel very proud, because my method has never failed once. Every time, they all stop moving before I shout "Three!"—the so-called movement includes fighting, quarreling, making trouble... all kinds of situations. Moreover, this order will only be effective if I designate it to anyone. I remember once, a friend wanted to test my words, he also gave a "One! Two! Three!" order, as a result, not only did they ignore him, but they also laughed at him; but when I officially announced that this friend also had the same power, they obediently followed. This is also what I considered when making the law, afraid that others would abuse it to curb the innocence of children.</p>

<h3>Collapse (Novel)</h3>
<p>— Yang Mou</p>
<p>The small attic room was exceedingly silent and still.</p>
<p>Outside in the back alley, the loud conversations of neighbors, the teasing between men and women, the laughter of children, and someone humming a popular song, ..., seemed very out of sync with the atmosphere in the room.</p>
<p>This was an attic room on the third floor, cramped and narrow, mostly filled with old, dusty furniture. Illuminated by a dim fifteen-candlepower lamp, the owner, a man who appeared to be around thirty, wearing tortoiseshell-rimmed glasses, with a flat-top haircut and a round face, was shirtless and marking papers, his face seemingly covered in the hardships of life's struggles.</p>
<p>He kept waving a palm-leaf fan with one hand, but could not stop the beads of sweat from constantly seeping out.</p>
<p>Looking at the large pile of exam papers on the desk, Shengsheng couldn't help but let out a slight sigh:</p>
<p>"This life," he muttered with a hint of resentment.</p>
<p>His mind conjured up images of friends and classmates who had gotten rich, driving cars and living in Western-style houses.</p>
<p>Unconsciously, he put down his pen. He raised his head, looking at the ceiling stained with yellow watermarks, envy and jealousy welling up together.</p>
<p>Clenching his lips with his teeth, he tried hard to control himself. The faces of young, lively students flashed through his mind, and he quickly picked up his pen again.</p>
<p>"Shengsheng, Shengsheng."</p>
<p>A burst of urgent knocking and loud calls came from the back door.</p>
<p>The voice seemed a little shaky, making it very unfamiliar to Shengsheng, and he couldn't recognize who was in such a hurry.</p>
<p>He had just stood up when the back door creaked open, probably the landlady from the ground floor, followed by the sound of hurried footsteps on the stairs.</p>
<p>"Oh, it's you."</p>
<p>Shengsheng could never have expected that the person standing before him, in such a flustered state, was Lan Jun.</p>
<p>Lan Jun was known as a very active figure in the Shanghai market, young, generous, with slicked-back hair and a sharp white suit, but tonight he was acting out of character, restless and uneasy.</p>
<p>He held out his hands, shrugged his shoulders, and Lan Jun sat on the edge of the bed with a bitter smile.</p>
<p>"Shengsheng, I've come to say goodbye."</p>
<p>Shengsheng couldn't imagine what this was all about. He stared blankly at Lan Jun, unable to utter a word.</p>
<p>"Well, I don't have much else to lose. I can talk for a while. This time, on the government bonds, even my family and reputation have been swept away. Now, well, there's only me left, and countless debts outside..."</p>
<p>Shengsheng began to understand.</p>
<p>Shengsheng and Lan Jun were from the same hometown and had been very good friends since childhood. As soon as they graduated from junior high school in their hometown, the flames of war dragged them into the vortex of the times.</p>
<p>After fleeing from their hometown to Shanghai, they remained like-minded friends. However, at the starting point of their careers, due to differences in environment and interests, they slowly parted ways.</p>
<p>Shengsheng struggled to get into middle school and then university, while Lan Jun started working as a black marketeer under the protection of the enemy at the train station.</p>
<p>Shengsheng advised Lan Jun, but it wasn't a matter of words; it was a test of real strength. Besides this path, Lan Jun himself and his family had no room to survive. With a fragile will, Lan Jun silently stepped into that world.</p>
<p>When Shengsheng graduated from university, struggling with no way out and working as a teacher in a private middle school, Lan Jun had already left the black market and was specializing in hoarding goods, accumulating considerable wealth.</p>
<p>"Lan Jun, this isn't a solution. You have to plan for your future!"</p>
<p>Shengsheng had advised Lan Jun like this several times.</p>
<p>"I think so too, but let's talk about it when it's brighter. Right now, what other way is there?"</p>
<p>Lan Jun always answered in the same way.</p>
<p>However, Lan Jun's extravagant lifestyle had sometimes caused Shengsheng to feel a secret envy, although he always refused when Lan Jun offered to help him.</p>
<p>"Shengsheng, don't worry, I've also been educated. I won't do anything too outrageous."</p>
<p>This was a phrase Lan Jun often used to comfort Shengsheng. Yes, he, a young boy who had only received a junior high school education, had to shoulder the heavy burden of his family. How could one demand more from him?</p>
<p>With the victory, Shengsheng warmly shook hands with Lan Jun. They could still move forward on the same path.</p>
<p>Lan Jun was also very excited. He found a vocational school, settled his family, and sincerely wanted to study for a few years to make up for the indelible deficiencies in his life.</p>
<p>Later, however, Lan Jun dropped out of school, after only a month, it seemed. He went back to his business.</p>
<p>Shengsheng asked Lan Jun, but he didn't answer.</p>
<p>Finally, he blurted out:</p>
<p>"What good is it to work hard like you!"</p>
<p>These words naturally contained some of his disappointment, and Shengsheng couldn't say a word in response.</p>
<p>After that, it was said that Lan Jun became even more active and extravagant, with cars, Western-style houses, and so on.</p>
<p>However, Lan Jun and Shengsheng became relatively estranged.</p>
<p>One lived in wealth, the other in poverty.</p>
<p>They were still friends, they sympathized with each other, they envied each other, and they cared about each other.</p>
<p>Shengsheng understood that Lan Jun had fallen from heaven all the way to hell. He sympathized with his situation, but couldn't think of a solution.</p>
<p>"You still don't rest..."</p>
<p>Shengsheng wanted to blame him, but seeing his lost expression, he couldn't help but feel a wave of pity.</p>
<p>"I know, I know, but after mingling in society so much during the war, how can I go back and study with young students? I couldn't stand it for even a month, so I came out. I wanted to find something to do, something good, but it still ended up like this. Sigh, myself..."</p>
<p>A stream of complaints, yes, a stream of complaints.</p>
<p>"What to do now?"</p>
<p>"There's nothing left. My family has all been sent back to our hometown. The house and furniture have been sold. There's only me left. I can't stay in Shanghai anymore. I don't know where to go next."</p>
<p>"Too fast," Shengsheng sighed unconsciously.</p>
<p>"Yes, too fast. One always reaps what one sows. For years, I've been laughing at you. Now I realize that your life and your work are long-lasting and eternal."</p>
<p>"No, no, no..."</p>
<p>Shengsheng was embarrassed and his emotions were confused.</p>
<p>Lan Jun had already stood up, tightly gripping Shengsheng's hand.</p>
<p>"Shengsheng, we may see each other again, or we may never see each other again. I will always be grateful for your concern in the past, and I will always envy your life! I'm leaving, leaving."</p>
<p>His hand loosened, he left, pulling the attic door shut behind him. A burst of hurried footsteps on the stairs. Shengsheng forgot to see him off.</p>
<p>He saw a figure, as if gradually fading and receding into the distance.</p>
<p>He collapsed onto the bed, a friend. He couldn't help but wish him well.</p>
<h3>A Visit to Liyuan Garden</h3>
<p>— Zhong Yuan</p>
<p>Everyone says the roses in Liyuan Garden are beautiful, but on the day Xiuming invited me to play there, I didn't expect it to be right after a rainstorm and hurricane, and the roses had all withered.</p>
<p>Next to a desolate little thatched pavilion, Xiuming found a relatively smooth and dry stone bench, gently pushed me towards it, sat down beside me, and said, "I didn't actually invite you to see any roses, but just wanted to find an opportunity to talk to you."</p>
<p>Xiuming spoke very softly. That gentle, slightly resolute voice was still as clear and pleasant as it had been nine years ago. Her long arm was draped over my shoulder, and a few slender fingers were playing with the hair at the back of my neck. She continued in a low voice: "I want to tell you about some of my pain, the pain that has been brewing in my heart for the past six months..."</p>
<p>"You're in pain?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Yes, I'm in pain..." she replied.</p>
<p>I curiously turned my head to look at Xiuming's face. That pointed face was still as delicate and beautiful as it had been back then. I looked at her left hand hanging on my shoulder again. That lovely little hand was also no different from back then. But now, on the fourth finger, there was a small white gold diamond ring, which hadn't been there nine years ago.</p>
<p>Could there be some dissatisfaction in her marriage?</p>
<p>I really couldn't think of any reason to dare suspect that. Such a talented and beautiful lady, a university graduate, who had experienced countless mountains and rivers, traveled all over half of China, and had contributed and worked for her country in the midst of gunfire and flames. Finally, with her incredibly sharp eyes, she had selected a talented, affectionate, rich, and extremely well-placed son-in-law from a thick register of suitors. Could there be any dissatisfaction?</p>
<p>No way! I thought to myself and said to her:</p>
<p>"I heard that your life is extremely happy!"</p>
<p>"Happy is indeed happy, but!"</p>
<p>Saying that, Xiuming's eyes suddenly turned strangely, revealing a terrible light. This light contained sadness, resentment, anger, and curses...</p>
<p>"To tell you the truth, I was completely fooled. It turns out he already had someone in the occupied areas..." She suddenly changed the subject and gave me a strange smile: "But now, he's divorced from that woman!"</p>
<p>"Isn't it good that you're divorced? What pain do you still have?" I said.</p>
<p>"But even though we're divorced, that hateful woman is still haunting me!"</p>
<p>"How is she haunting you?"</p>
<p>"She follows us everywhere. We go to Shanghai, she goes to Shanghai. We go to Nanjing, she goes to Nanjing. Now we've come back to our hometown for the summer, and she's come again. And that woman, although she's also very young, is like a crazy woman. Every time she sees us, she just stares blankly. She stares whether we ignore her, glare at her, or scold her. It's simply impossible to deal with..."</p>
<p>Xiuming went on and on. I listened quietly. It was getting late, and I was coughing a bit. Xiuming stopped talking and said, "You're tired. Let's go back."</p>
<p>I was indeed a bit tired, but afraid of neglecting my old friend whom I hadn't seen for a long time, I accompanied her on a circuit inside Liyuan before leaving. She said a lot more about that woman, but I didn't listen. I just silently gazed at the roses that had been ravaged by the hurricane and rainstorm, and felt sad in my heart.</p>
<p>Leaving Liyuan Garden, Xiuming asked me to come back and talk another day. I didn't agree. She asked me why. I said, "I'm afraid of seeing those poor roses!"</p>
<p>I really didn't want to visit Liyuan Garden again, and I didn't even want to see that beautiful and lovely friend again.</p>
<h3>Highland Goddess (Selection of World Famous Paintings)</h3>
<p>— By Foss (1868-1904)</p>
<p>Collection of the Tate Museum, London</p>
<p>Foss (C.W. Furse) was born in Staines. He studied painting early in his life but had a weak constitution. He was often ill during his studies and eventually died at the age of thirty-six. The painting "Highland Goddess" depicts his wife standing proudly in the wind, and the picture is filled with a spacious and peaceful atmosphere.</p>
<h3>Can't Leave Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Xie Zi</p>
<p>Recently, I met a friend who said he was in a very bad mood. Since his father's death, because he had some family affairs to take care of, he hadn't been out of the house for more than a month. As soon as he stayed in the house, he seemed to be stuck. He was rarely at home, but this time he had been at home for more than two months, not stepping out the door. The complexity of family affairs made him embarrassed. His mother consulted him on everything, and the eyes of the whole family were focused on him, hoping that he would have a solution, but he had no solution at all. He couldn't get interested in anything. Even when his girlfriend came to see him, he felt nothing, as if he had forgotten love, as if he had never loved. His depression was multifaceted, and none of those facets could be resolved. He told me about his recent daily life: he didn't get up until after eleven o'clock in the morning. After washing up, it was already time for lunch. Sometimes he got up even later. People asked him to eat, but he said, "You eat first." After he was done, he would move the dishes into the room, pour himself a drink, and eat alone. After eating, he would casually look at the newspaper, but never read a book. Sometimes friends would come to see him—not any friends, but friends who lived nearby with nothing to do. They would chat about everything under the sun until four or five o'clock. Maybe they would buy some wine, prepare a few dishes, and eat for three or four hours. After his friends left, he would turn on the radio and listen to the broadcast, from pop songs to news reports, Beijing opera, Yue opera, and even drum ballads and local operas, listening to everything. As long as it was continuous sound, as long as it was sound that would make him forget everything about himself, he would keep listening, listening until after two o'clock in the morning. That was how he spent his day. Day after day, he felt extremely depressed, but he was helpless. To him, his family was like a depressing cave.</p>
<p>I said, "If you go on a trip to a distant place, it might have a good effect on your mind and body."</p>
<p>He said, "That's exactly what I'm thinking. If I could take a close girlfriend and spend this summer in Qingdao, how happy that would be! Get up early in the morning and go to the beach to breathe fresh air, or rather, to breathe in the vigor of the dawn world. I've always thought that Qingdao has a poetic atmosphere. I also like swimming. I can wash away the filth in the cool sea water. In the evening, go to the ballroom to listen to music. The soft music combined with the tide of the seashore must be especially lovely… That way, my body can slowly get better, and my mood will gradually become regular. But I don't have enough money, and I don't have that kind of status. This is just a fantasy."</p>
<p>"Then going to your old home in Suzhou would also be good, it's better than staying here."</p>
<p>"Suzhou?" He looked at me with a wry smile and said, "Just thinking about Suzhou gives me a headache. Looking around, it's always that small circle. There's no place to play, and there's no one to talk to. By eight o'clock in the evening, the whole of Suzhou is silent. I prefer the night, but everyone is asleep. If you're the only one who's not asleep, even making a little noise will surprise people. In short, in Suzhou, there's no place to look for even anesthetization."</p>
<p>From his words, it can be seen that he yearned for a vast and open world, while still being attached to Shanghai, attached to the prosperity here, attached to the enjoyment of the sights, sounds, and tastes here. Although he cursed Shanghai, saying that he didn't feel comfortable staying here, in reality, his curses were like a mother scolding her child, still loving him in her heart. His yearning for Qingdao was also just a yearning for vastness and openness. He didn't realize how vague and distant that was.</p>
<p>Except for thorough urban dwellers, no one can be completely satisfied with the city. Except for thorough country folk, no one can leave it without any attachment. We live in the city, immersed in the city, often only seeing its troubling side, and forgetting its loveliness. Once we think of leaving it, all of its lovely points are exposed. If we go to the countryside, the first thing we feel is inconvenience. There are no electric lights or running water. Stepping out the door, the roads are rugged and the scenery is desolate, making us feel even more uncomfortable. This is still the simplest. In our daily lives, we inevitably feel cramped everywhere, because all humans have a tendency to be gregarious. The love of bustling prosperity and the adherence to dazzling human civilization are also one of our natures. Leaving the city is like leaving humanity. That feeling of loneliness and desolation creates resentment in our hearts. I remember a Japanese person saying, "I can't bear to leave Shanghai, I can't bear to leave the women of Shanghai." This is not a simple witty remark, but it actually comes from the heart. However, we still yearn for all distant places, because distance makes them vague and therefore perfect, as if as long as we go to a distant place, everything can be resolved and everything can be set aside. But in reality, Qingdao isn't necessarily better than Suzhou. Suzhou is also a famous paradise. However, he experienced the life of Suzhou and therefore lost his yearning. Losing his yearning, Suzhou's mystery was also lost. If he had always lived in the north, he might be yearning for this gentle and charming water town of Jiangnan, just as he is yearning for Qingdao now. But once he achieved his goal, everything would be completely different.</p>
<p>This kind of yearning for vastness and openness can be said to be a poetic quality, a dissatisfaction with reality. It is restless and unstable, like a giant eagle soaring freely in the sky. If a person takes a trip around the world, perhaps every place will be lovely, but if you asked him to stay there forever, no place would be perfect. He doesn't want to be overwhelmed by the flood of materialism, because he has a soaring soul. Yet, he also can't give up the prosperity of the city, because he is passionate.</p>
<p>"I think you should still stay here," I said. "Take a trip when you have the chance. People like you, and me too, we can't leave Shanghai."</p>
<h3>An Inch of Mountain, An Inch of River, An Inch of Blood</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng 15</p>
<p>"Ah—uh!" A kind of strangely ugly and disgusting calling sound made people feel numb in the nerves. This money-grubbing guy standing beside me, called loudly and gesticulated towards another sentry post on the north side of the hillside, thinking that knowing his identity wouldn't solve our problem, so he was looking for someone to escort us to see the superior officer.</p>
<p>"106th Division, Hirasaka Unit, 131st Regiment, 3rd Squad, Private First Class ××." I had already read their unit numbers clearly. I remembered that a few days ago, this unit was still gathering in the country. But now they were already here taking action.</p>
<p>The so-called superior officer was a squad leader. People from Shanghai curse others as "pig brutes." In my imagination, this pig brute should have a low-sloping forehead, nostrils turned up to the sky, and a protruding lower jaw, so that his lips couldn't cover his big front teeth. At first glance, you could think of the posture of "bared fangs and brandished claws." If a pig brute is like this, then this deputy squad leader happened to fit the model of this standard pig brute, only adding two big gold teeth, emitting a dazzling yellow light.</p>
<p>"I ought to inquire about the department Your Excellency serves first, I am very sorry for being impolite."</p>
<p>I don't know why, I suddenly thought of the "Pigsy Seeks a Bride" I saw at the Shanghai Grand Theatre, that bridegroom; wasn't he also twisting and pinching, learning to act like a person, making two or three sentences of speech that were neither fish nor fowl?</p>
<p>Our plan was not to use the small railway or military vehicles to go straight to Beiping, because we wanted to maintain not letting anyone know our whereabouts. Otherwise, we would have already arrived in Beiping; because the sign of the Continental General Staff Headquarters could ask any party for convenient transportation.</p>
<p>"We should use the fifteenth method!" I had already made up my mind:</p>
<p>"The department is the Imperial Japanese Army Ministry General Staff Headquarters Imperial Army Continental Operations Department General Staff Headquarters; my position is Major-level Special Commissioner ×××× of the General Staff Headquarters Special Operations; this trip is a military secret, impossible to tell you, sorry for being impolite."</p>
<p>When speaking to at least a junior officer, your eyes should be looking at the sky, or the ceiling. This is the style of "turning a blind eye to people." At this time, I always maintained this style—hypocritical, arrogant, cunning, treacherous, fierce, and an exaggeratedly crazy style.</p>
<p>The wine, Changxindian Bai Gan, Japanese Authentic, Shanghai "Beer"; dishes; chicken, duck, canned sardines; and Beiping cantaloupe, hawthorn sugar, etc. No one knows where this enjoyment came from, how it was obtained, even though it was only a small regiment.</p>
<p>At this time, I could only patiently enjoy his offering. Little Tiger used the disguise of "Manchukuo" Anyang Special Agent and wolfed down the food in a very happy but also very alert manner. From this child's eyes, you can see two points; he didn't fail to see that the Japanese devils hated his gluttony so much that their teeth were itching, but they couldn't stop him; so he was happy to eat to his heart's content, while also expressing "Eating this bastard's food, serves you right for being in pain, who told you to provoke me?"</p>
<p>Several times I told this pig brute that I had urgent official business and had to get to the city; but his reason was difficult to refute;</p>
<p>"Replying to the commissioner, if Your Excellency had not condescended to visit my humble tent, walking there would mean only arriving in the city late at night. Taking this highway, you must first get to Dahui Factory, five or six kilometers, Dahui Factory crosses the Yongding River to Tiancun, about eleven or twelve kilometers, and then to Xizhimen, which is another nearly ten kilometers. The small roads are even more difficult to travel. It is better to wait until it gets dark—actions are more free—have subordinates use automobiles to travel along my army's defense line to the nearest stronghold to the city, a total of only one or two hours, and you can reach the city walls." He also spread out a map to prove that his plan was clever, although he was already ninety-nine percent drunk.</p>
<p>When getting in the car, I turned my back to the two Japanese drivers and that pig brute deputy squad leader, and gave Little Tiger an emergency warning code, a gesture that a smart child could understand. Opening [the door], Little Tiger and I sat in the car, and that drunken pig brute sat in the front with the driver. After traveling less than a mile, that guy suddenly ordered the car to stop, got out of the car, and apologized to me, asking to sit in the back compartment, saying that it could protect me more thoroughly.</p>

<h3>The Tragedy on Bi Xun Road</h3>
<p>— Shao Fu</p>
<p>Please Respond, Municipal Government</p>
<p>There's a popular Shanghai curse, "to die unjustly," similar in meaning to "plague-ridden." Literally, it means to die wronged or to die aggrieved. Naturally, it carries the sense of "not worth it" or "undeserved," with a hint of regret and sympathy. However, when this curse is used, it often contains the indignant sentiment of blaming the person for deserving to die or being unlucky.</p>
<p>The original source of "to die unjustly" comes from motor vehicle accidents. Later, it gradually became a specific term for the wronged souls under the wheels. At that time, the Mixed Court in the concessions showed no pity for pedestrians who died due to violations of traffic regulations. The punishment was merely a fine of tens of dollars for the driver. This method was considered correct in alerting pedestrians to urban traffic rules, preventing them from walking on the streets arbitrarily without observing public order. But it also had its drawbacks, easily fostering arrogance in drivers who considered manslaughter merely a matter of spending a few dollars. Hence, the saying that the streets were like the mouths of tigers.</p>
<p>However, today, on the streets of Shanghai, not only do outsiders unfamiliar with traffic regulations find it difficult to move, but even citizens who strictly adhere to the Municipal Government's pedestrian instructions have the chance of becoming "wronged dead" at any moment. Everyone talks about tigers changing color, viewing going out as a long journey. If the Municipal Government does not consider a solution to this serious phenomenon, the 4.7 million people will be unable to understand the Municipal Government for the sake of their safety.</p>
<p>Not to mention distant events, yesterday witnessed an absurd and most tragic scene: the wife and children of the late Martyr Zhang Yongchun, former member of the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee, were run over and killed by a U.S. Army hospital medic's car on the sidewalk of Bi Xun Road. It's not because the deceased was the principal of a municipal elementary school or the family of the late Martyr Zhang Yongchun, former member of the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee, that we are paying special attention to this matter. Rather, it's because the deceased met with an accident on the sidewalk and because such automobile accidents have been occurring incessantly recently. We, the ordinary citizens without cars, cannot but feel that our personal safety is not guaranteed, that we are likely to be killed at any time, that we are not willing to die unjustly in such a muddled manner. We ask the Municipal Government to give us security!</p>
<p>The Bi Xun Road tragedy demands an explanation!</p>
<p>In addition, we want to ask:</p>
<p>1. How are driver's licenses issued? What are the driver management rules? Do military vehicles require driver's licenses? Are drivers subject to management?</p>
<p>2. Is there a standard limit to the number of vehicles allowed? Can they increase without limit, without considering road area?</p>
<p>3. Has a method for military vehicles traveling in urban areas been researched?</p>
<p>4. Is the Municipal Government satisfied with the current traffic situation? (Cars are parked haphazardly, the timing of traffic lights is not standardized…)</p>
<p>Regarding traffic issues, we have repeatedly explained, because we have no other choice. We also deeply know the efforts and difficulties of the Municipal Government, but until safety and convenience are achieved, please forgive us for never giving up on this issue.</p>
<h3>Goals for Establishing Teacher's Day: (1) Improve Treatment, (2) Guarantee Status, (3) Enhance Cultivation.</h3>
<p>— Zheng Fan</p>
<p>First, let me tell you about the origin of "Teacher's Day." It was in the 20th year of the Republic [1931]. On June 6th of that year, more than 300 teachers from Beijing and Shanghai, in order to consolidate their status, improve their treatment, and strive for self-cultivation, agreed to gather at National Central University to hold a meeting. After unanimous agreement, they decided to make that day "Teacher's Day" every year. It was not until August 15th of the 28th year of the Republic [1939] that the Executive Yuan's 427th decision meeting decided to change Teacher's Day to Confucius's birthday on August 27th every year, the reason being "to deeply imply the meaning of admiring the ultimate sage amidst the people's happiness and well-being."</p>
<p>From this, we can see the goals for establishing Teacher's Day: first, to improve teachers' treatment; second, to guarantee teachers' status; and third, to enhance teachers' cultivation.</p>
<p>Teacher's Day has reached its 16th anniversary today. Have these three goals been achieved?</p>
<p>Let's first talk about teachers' treatment. The meager treatment of teachers has been "the case since ancient times," and it is even worse today. The cry for "improving treatment" has lasted for sixteen years, and the salaries teachers receive decrease year by year. You know the treatment of ordinary elementary school teachers in Shanghai today, but you may not know what kind of lives rural teachers in the interior are living. Rural elementary school teachers currently receive a monthly salary of 20,000 yuan, which is delayed by as much as three months. Before the war, education funding accounted for 20% of the budget, but today, after countless cries of "education first," education funding has fallen to only 4.7% of the budget. Teachers' lives are unstable. Words like "building the nation by prioritizing education" are all "empty words!"</p>
<p>In Nanjing, a teacher was so poor that he had no clothes to wear and went to class wearing his wife's cheongsam. He worked as a laborer at night to supplement the family's expenses. News of teachers committing family suicide due to the pressure of life has been spreading throughout the country. In Shanghai, a teacher from a certain school stole a sum of money from a colleague, escaped to the West Lake in Hangzhou, and had a period of extravagant fun before committing suicide. Today's newspapers are filled with teachers' cries, and every corner is filled with teachers' sighs and groans! Isn't this a national disgrace?</p>
<p>Secondly, guaranteeing the status of teachers is even more regrettable! Today, a teacher's status has nothing to do with profound knowledge or rich experience. It completely depends on students' likes and dislikes, the principal's dismissal, and colleagues' factionalism. Even at a dignified National University today, the president can arbitrarily dismiss teachers and staff. What else can we say? And society's attitude towards teachers, who are "entrusted with heavy responsibilities and long journeys," is neither "respecting teachers" nor "valuing the Way." Past events like the "Su Yizhi incident" are enough to explain this. Teachers are subjected to double contempt. What is there to say about "guaranteeing status"?</p>
<p>There's no need to mention teachers' self-cultivation. Today, teachers' treatment is insufficient to support parents above and insufficient to care for children below. "If teeth are lost in old age, what good is death?" Those with connections are unwilling to "die old in the countryside" and are changing careers one after another. What's left is a group of desperate old teachers and a batch of new teachers with shallow qualifications filling the ranks. In rural elementary schools, graduates of higher primary schools are also teachers, and those who dropped out of junior high schools are teaching in middle schools. How can one expect them to perform? Zhuangzi said, "Focusing one's will and spirit leads to concentration." Ordinary teachers are so overwhelmed by the pressures of rice, oil, salt, and firewood that they feel dizzy. How can you ask them to "polish and sharpen" themselves, "strive for improvement," or anything else? It's just "worrying about its difficulty."</p>
<p>Not long ago, the news of a certain school principal raping a female student in the newspapers left us speechless. The overall decline in the quality of Chinese teachers is self-evident, but if the teachers' own character and personality also collapse, how can one bear to imagine the consequences?</p>
<p>Alright, it seems that the complaints have been exhausted. I must still praise teachers as being great after all. H.G. Wells of England said: "Teachers are the real creators of history, rulers. Politicians and the masses of our time are merely puppets of their childhood education." Long live teachers! Long live!</p>
<p>I'll end with two lines of a teacher's song: "Teachers respect me, establish my conduct in the world; teachers treat me as children, as daughters."</p>
<h3>Teacher's Salaries in Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Paul</p>
<p>The salaries of teachers and staff in this city can be divided into two types: municipal and private.</p>
<p>The salaries of municipal school teachers and staff are the same as those of civil servants: base salary multiplied by 380, plus a living allowance of 80,000 yuan. If the average base salary is calculated at 100 yuan, each municipal school teacher receives 118,000 yuan in legal tender per month.</p>
<p>Private school teachers and staff, according to the Education Bureau's regulations, allocate 30% of the tuition fees collected to school expenses and 70% to teachers' salaries. Therefore, the treatment of private school teachers and staff varies and depends on the amount of tuition fees collected and the number of students. Their salaries may exceed those of municipal school teachers, but the majority are still lower than those of municipal school teachers.</p>
<p>The funding for municipal schools is approved by the Education Bureau, while private schools have always been financially independent. Therefore, in order to improve teachers' salaries and cope with the difficult life, they only have one way: to increase tuition fees.</p>
<h3>Also Discussing Puyi</h3>
<p>— Qi Lu</p>
<p>Emperor's Luck, Puppet's Fate</p>
<p>When Puyi testified at the Tokyo International Tribunal and was cross-examined by the defense lawyers of the accused, his answers were repeatedly "I don't know" and "I'm not aware." Indeed, an emperor puppet who was not his own master, like Puyi, what could he know, what could he be aware of?</p>
<p>Puyi had never been a crown prince; his father, Zaifeng, was not an emperor. Because Zaitian (the Guangxu Emperor) died without a son, the imperial family chose his nephew Puyi to inherit the emperor's throne. At that time, Puyi was only two years old and was named the Xuantong Emperor. What is a three-year-old emperor if not a puppet?</p>
<p>After Puyi entered the emperor's luck at the age of three, he encountered the Xinhai Revolution in his third year. The puppet masters at that time were clever and opened negotiations with the revolutionary army, managing to enjoy the preferential treatment of the Republic. In the palace, Puyi was still considered an emperor, but the palace was also restricted. The ministers of the small court could no longer enter or exit Tiananmen from the south but could only enter or exit D'anmen from the north. This is like the small families in Shanghai—entering and exiting through the back door.</p>
<p>In the sixth year of the Republic, the pigtail master Zhang Xun caused a restoration and tried to lift Puyi out, but it didn't succeed. Zhang Xun fled into the Dutch embassy, and Puyi still sat securely in the palace, entering and exiting through the back door. Until the 13th year of the Republic, Feng Yuxiang returned his troops to Beijing, issued an eviction order to Puyi, and abolished the preferential treatment treaty for the Qing royal family. From then on, everyone thought that Puyi's emperor's luck had run out. Who knew that after the September 18th Incident in the 20th year of the Republic [1931], Puyi was taken by the Japanese Doihara Kenji from Tianjin to Dalian. The following year, he went to Changchun and became the head of the "Manchukuo," later changed to "Emperor." The Xuantong Emperor became the "Kangde Emperor," and Puyi again entered thirteen years of emperor's luck until he was captured by the Soviet Air Force at the Shenyang airfield in August of the 34th year of the Republic [1945] and became a prisoner. This time, his emperor's luck must be exhausted. Otherwise, the history of this world is reversing instead of progressing.</p>
<p>When Puyi was breastfeeding and became the Qing Dynasty emperor, he was truly a puppet. When he became the "Manchukuo" emperor after adulthood, he was still a puppet. During the decade before and after the 10th year of the Republic, when Puyi entered the youth period of his life, he was influenced by the New Culture Movement after the May Fourth Movement. He once invited Hu Shih into the palace to ask for advice and once wanted to freely choose his own marriage. The result of his marriage was still not his own choice. What he could choose was to cut off his braid at that time. This was the only conscious action in his life of being a puppet manipulated by others.</p>
<p>Puyi was originally the last emperor of the Qing Dynasty. The Qing Dynasty palace was the Ming Dynasty palace. The back door faced Coal Hill (also known as Jingshan), the place where Emperor Chongzhen, the last emperor of the Ming Dynasty, committed suicide. I don't know what Puyi thought of the anger expressed by Emperor Chongzhen when he killed his children and then hanged himself, "I wish that in all lives, I would not be born into an imperial family"?</p>
<h3>Beggars Asking for Money</h3>
<p>— Yang Wei</p>
<p>There are many beggars on the streets of Shanghai. Some are very young and still use tin cans with "nails"; if you don't give them money, they will stubbornly stay put and say impolite things. Their quick wit and high tolerance are really admirable! Have any readers encountered situations similar to the following?</p>
<p>"Old man, open your generous hands, live to be ninety-nine."</p>
<p>"No, no."</p>
<p>"Old sir, bright goes away, dark comes, not a penny lost on empty land."</p>
<p>"Turn around, turn around."</p>
<p>"Old sir, everyone has a heart of compassion, please save someone in trouble."</p>
<p>"Go, go, go!"</p>
<p>"Boss, the poor become rich, the rich are destined, today I give you a pancake, next year you'll open a big store with insurance."</p>
<p>"Run, run, run!"</p>
<p>"Children and grandchildren have their own blessings, don't be a beast of burden for them, old sir, please be generous."</p>
<p>"Get lost, get lost!"</p>
<p>"Damn it, will you give me something or not?"</p>
<p>"Cursing people means no donation."</p>
<p>"Pig brain, dog skin is useless, strangled to death, eyes closed, no descendants, you'll have to buy a coffin yourself."</p>
<h3>A Regretful Event in the Education World</h3>
<p>— Zheng Fan</p>
<p>Random Thoughts on Current Affairs</p>
<p>Still the same old Chinese officialdom habits:</p>
<p>A few days ago, newspapers reported that Mr. ×××, the newly appointed president of × National ×× University – Note: This Mr. ××× is the educator who drove his car and fled the scene of an accident and was chased by the deputy chief of police – after taking office, decided to rehire only 38 out of the original 160 faculty and staff members. Professors and others expressed indignation at Mr. ×'s dismissal without cause and are currently negotiating.</p>
<p>The dismissal of teachers is a common sight in various private schools and academies in Shanghai and is not surprising. However, for it to happen at a dignified National University, which is praised as the "highest institution of learning," we cannot help but find it strange. The qualifications of × University's professors have long been praised domestically. During the Anti-Japanese War, the school moved to Jianyang in northern Fujian, and faculty and staff members left their families and devoted themselves to their work. It was because of their hard work that × University created a glorious history! And today, this group of "hardworking" faculty and staff members are being kept outside the school gates because the president has been changed!</p>
<p>It is said that Mr. × also has his "reasons." His reason is that he once said in a non-public conversation with the former president of × University, Mr. ×, that "some colleagues are preparing to help at Yingda [a British-run university], some colleagues already have high-paying jobs elsewhere, some colleagues have not been working hard, some colleagues cannot be placed... there are many reasons, too many to list in detail." Therefore, in order to respect the opinion of the former president Mr. ×××, Mr. × decided not to rehire these people.</p>
<p>In short, the dismissal of more than 100 faculty members was entirely due to the instructions of the former president Mr. ×××. Fortunately, Mr. × has died, and he is happy to push it on a dead person, indicating that it has nothing to do with himself.</p>
<p>However, faculty and staff members are neither slaves nor commodities. Why can they be arbitrarily manipulated and controlled in a "non-public conversation" (assuming Mr. × is telling the truth)? Are there sufficient evidence and reasons for each point raised?</p>
<p>The faculty and staff members of × University are crying out:</p>
<p>"Heaven knows, after returning to our homes, we are followed by layoffs. The beautiful dream of having a stable job has not been realized, and the threat of unemployment is imminent. The nation and the people are breathing the air of freedom, but we are being treated like slaves and goods, arbitrarily manipulated and controlled. We don't know what Mr. × is thinking, but he has used this unprecedented and perhaps never-to-be-repeated destructive method in the history of school appointments!"</p>
<p>Today is "Teacher's Day," but the teachers of × University are struggling in the dark.</p>
<p>This is indeed a great regret in the education world!</p>
<h3>At the Small Vegetable Market</h3>
<p>— Jin Jing</p>
<p>I am a housewife in an eight-person household, so naturally I have to go to the vegetable market every day to buy vegetables. The square two-story vegetable market on Zhoushan Road is indeed quite well-scaled, with fish, meat, shrimp, crabs, all kinds of rare delicacies.</p>
<p>Because of poor purchasing power, every day carrying a basket, I always wander in a corner concentrated with vegetables, nothing more than buying some nutritious and relatively inexpensive vegetables to suit the material conditions of "coarse vegetables are enough to satisfy my hunger."</p>
<p>The world is deteriorating, and people's hearts are not as they used to be. Even buying and selling in the vegetable market is affected. In addition to disputes over haggling over weight, there has been an increase in the bad practice of grabbing and scooping. Sometimes there is even a fact that one buys less but scoops more.</p>
<p>I absolutely don't want to openly steal some scoops to increase the quantity and quality that I should get, but no matter what vegetables or bean sprouts I buy, they are much less than what the neighbor's wife buys for the same price.</p>
<p>This question was explained by someone familiar with the situation in the vegetable market, who knew that vegetable vendors because they resisted the bad habit of buyers grabbing and scooping, they have long calculated the extra demands of buyers into the cost, and the customers who do not grab and scoop from him are treated preferentially. This bad habit has become an open secret, and it is rare for those who don't understand it.</p>
<p>I can't bear to steal openly, and I can't help but go to the vegetable market to buy, but it seems that I am forever buying too few vegetables at an excessively high price, and I am endlessly burdened. I hope to destroy bad habits!</p>

<h3>Prominent Figure: Marshal Tito</h3>
<p>— Gui Ting</p>
<p>The Dictator of Yugoslavia (Part 2)</p>
<p>Besides Tito's Communist Party, there were three other political groups in Yugoslavia: Mikhailovic's Chetnik party, Mussolini's supported terrorist group, Ustashe, and General Nedic's organized puppet government. Tito's Communist guerrillas were risking their lives to compete with them for power. Soon, Mikhailovic and Tito began fighting each other. Tito discredited his political enemies as collaborators with the Nazis. Until recently, Mikhailovic was actually executed for treason by collaborating with the enemy.</p>
<p>Everything Modeled After the Soviet Union</p>
<p>After Tito received support from the Soviet Union, his power rapidly increased. All his movements were completely modeled after the Soviet Union. The military used a clenched fist as a salute, but after the British mission arrived, it was abolished in December 1943. People's representatives were everywhere, supposedly carrying out the mission of spreading political education. The national flag used was the red star flag. Everyone called each other "comrade." Flyers always printed pictures of Tito and Stalin together. They also had a secret intelligence organization called OZNA, which was established by imitating the Soviet Union's NKVD and OGPU.</p>
<p>In 1943, in order to avoid conflict with their ally, the Soviet Union, the British and Americans abandoned Mikhailovic and began to support Tito. British and American supplies flowed to Tito's guerrillas, so they were also equipped in the English style. Young men and women all joined the guerrillas led by Tito. About 25% of his army were women. Physically strong village girls fought alongside men, sharing meals and living quarters, but there was no sexual promiscuity because Tito encouraged the creed that those who committed adultery should be shot.</p>
<p>About 70% of Tito's subordinates were young men under the age of 25. Most of the generals were around 30 years old. Tito also organized youth groups. Members participated in hysterical movements to support Tito. Their minds were filled day and night with exciting slogans such as "Freedom!" and "Liberation from Fascist oppression!" They muttered, "Ti-to—Ti-to—Ti-to!" like a pendulum. They didn't use their minds to analyze things. They all believed that they were fighting for "democracy" because their marshal told them to do so.</p>
<p>Tito's Party Platform</p>
<p>The National Liberation Front led by Tito called for the following party platform: (1) Establish a Yugoslav federation with national equality, (2) Safeguard democratic rights and freedoms, (3) Respect the inviolability of private property, and (4) Never launch revolutionary economic or social reforms. On the surface, it sounded quite good, but under Tito's rule, the entire economic and social organization of Yugoslavia gradually became Sovietized. Under Tito's orders, the people of Yugoslavia were brainwashed day and night with the thought of "the Great Soviet Union" and "the Glorious Soviet Union." Once, they even pointed to the 300 B-17 planes soaring in the sky and shouted, "This is the great Soviet Air Force!"</p>
<p>The recent deterioration in relations with the West shows that Yugoslavia may become the source of future global unrest. Look! On the west side of Yugoslavia is a long coastline full of ports, enough to accommodate the navies of the world, and on the east side is the Soviet Union, a continental country lacking an outlet, eyeing it covetously. In the middle sits Tito, a full-bodied former Soviet Communist Party commissioner.</p>
<p>The world seems to be standing on the edge of a volcanic eruption. Will Tito be the first to ignite the world by creating unrest?</p>
