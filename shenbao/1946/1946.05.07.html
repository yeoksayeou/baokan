<p>〔本報南京六日電〕行政院定七日晨十時舉行還都後首次正式會議，聞將根據最高國防會與中常會聯席會議指示提高公務員待遇，照現有月薪增加百分之五十至百分之一百可能。因物價高漲，目前一南京特別市長，所得區區十四萬元之月俸，尙不及一黃包車夫收入，低級公務員之痛苦可知，以目前京市物價言，縱增加一倍，亦不爲多。</p>

<h3>「五五茶會」紀盛</h3>
<p>— 本報南京特約記者　趙浩生</p>
<p>五月五日下午四點半鐘，在國府禮堂中舉行的「五五茶會」，是還都盛典中最熱鬧的一個節目，各國使節，各部長官·各中委。參政員等都接到一份由主席及夫人聯名的請帖，國府大門內，站立着一排儀仗隊，向每位到來的嘉賓敬禮，中外來賓，分別在左右兩個簽名台上簽名後，每人贈送一個大紅色圓形上面印着「五五茶會」的來賓證，尤其是各國使節和夫人們，當招待員把來賓證掛到他們的襟上時，像給他們掛上了歡笑—他們在爲中國的勝利歡笑，因為在這次長久的反侵略戰爭中，他們與中國人民並肩作戰，今天在全面的勝利後，他們是應該來分享中國勝利的歡喜的。</p>
<p>何總長與夫人到得很早，記者在簽名台前，請他在卡片上題「勝利還都」四字以作紀念，蘇聯大使彼得羅夫穿着藏靑色嗶嘰西服，淺咖啡帶白條約褲子，挽着盛裝的夫人含笑先來，茶會開始前十分鐘，在林立着的朱紅巨柱的大庭內，那身才高大的馬歇爾元帥也　然蒞臨了，他親切的挽着夫人在大庭中且走且談，他對國府堂皇偉麗的建築極感興趣。馬帥是懂得中國的，他知道那朱紅色的巨柱，是莊嚴崇高和權威的象徵，他在低聲的和夫人解釋，他仰頭瞻望着那描花的屋頂，面孔上浮着動人的笑意，他那天仍然穿着一身嗶嘰美國軍服，配繁白色五星元帥的肩章，與記者四個月前在重慶時所看到的馬帥，衣着上是毫無改變，但他的胸脯似乎更挺直，面孔似乎更紅潤了。馬帥是以不斷的工作，來保持着他的健康的，馬師夫人，是一位滿面慈祥表情異常嫻靜的夫人，她那大穿着淺咖啡色絲質的露胸西服，擊着綴有金色扣鈕的腰帶，輕巧的帽子上面，點綴着一朶粉紅一朵淺藍色的茶花，走進第二道門，她把項間的裘巾和白色的手套一起取下搭在手臂上，他的身體和馬帥同樣的健壯，但不若馬帥修長，這一對同樣慈祥健康的老年夫妻，是一幅美麗的人生畫，這含笑並肩走來的貴賓，成了大家最注視的人物。在簽名台前，馬帥夫人先在那精緻而巨大的簽名册上輕快的寫上一行秀美的字，馬帥更鄭重接着寫着他大寫S開始的簽署，當招待員分別在他們的襟上帶上那小巧的來賓證時，馬帥和夫人在相視而笑，不斷的說着：「謝謝」</p>
<p>有全身禮服的武官，有燕尾服的紳士，貴夫人們一個個都是盛擴，他們的衣着雖然不同，但面孔上都是浮着同肅的歡笑。貴賓們分別走到休息室中，或在走廊上握手談笑，國府內洋溢着一片歡喜。</p>
<p>記者參加大會時曾帶進一份申報，在長廊上碰到新聞界的前輩邵力子先生，他首先把記者帶來的報紙借去，取下他的近視眼鏡，站在長廊中看，跟着有一位與記者相熟的主席辦公室職員走來，他說主席現在要閱讀上海報紙，不知各報是否已經到了？當時是四點多鐘，各報已到京，想是因爲國府路上不易通行，以致沒有送來，記者就將邵先生看的一份申報，交他轉呈主席，這是在還都大典之日，主席所看到的第一份上海報紙。</p>
<p>四點半鐘，主席與夫人從裏面走出來了，仍然穿着上午謁陵時的衣着，只是主席未戴帽子，走廊上的來賓傘分開兩邊肅立致敬，主席微笑點頭，連呼「好！好！」，並招呼着兩邊的客人們前面走，夫人同肅微笑着向大家點頭示意。</p>
<p>軍樂聲響了，來賓們隨着主席及夫人魚貫走進會塲，那四方形的大庭內，布置着四個長長的桌子，各色名貴點心，在大盤中堆得高高的，茶會以鷄尾酒會的形式舉行，來賓們自由走動最用茶點，軍樂隊奏着最輕快的曲子，侍者端上檸檬茶，大家豪飮暢談，禮堂內中外文武官員冠蓋憲集，　上夫人們的衣香　影，偌大的禮堂也裝不下這漫天的歡喜。</p>
<p>蔣主席站立在正中一列長桌中間，不斷招呼着貫賓們用點心，主席左邊是彼得羅夫大使，右邊是宋院長，王外長，在禮堂　　右邊的玻璃窗下，有着一　更動人的鏡頭，主席夫人與馬帥夫人圍饒着一個圓桌坐着，馬帥以極輕鬆的姿態，兩手扶着兩位夫人的沙發背在談笑，這一角的笑聲朗朗，連續不斷，形成了道大團歡樂中的最高音階。</p>
<p>外交部職員爲主席介紹各國武官參贊及夫人等，一一與主席握手，鞠躬，致賀，最後主席走到主席夫人與馬師夫婦所在的圓桌前，馬帥與夫人再次向主席握手道喜，主席與夫人，以主人身份再請貴賓多用茶點。</p>
<p>記者在人叢中分請各長官在名片上簽字，當走向主席夫人面前陳明來意時，夫人微笑着點項允諾，放下端在手中的茶杯，在沙發的扶手上，用鋼筆愉快的寫下「勝利還都」四字，讀者可以在這輕　的字跡上，看到主席夫人歡喜的心情。</p>
<p>五時半，主席與夫人先向大家吿辭走出禮堂，茶會還在繼續進行，在這極度歡喜的心情中，人們是會忘記了時間的。</p>
<p>六點多鐘才盡歡結束，軍樂奏着依依相送的曲子，夕陽更爲每位佳賓的滿浮歡笑的臉上鍍上一層艷紅。（五日深夜于南京）</p>

<h3>還都後國內政治的展望</h3>
<p>昨政府還都　蔣主席率領文武百僚，民衆代表展敬總理，這是中國人民八年來期夕所禱祝的盛事。在這個歷史的塲金，在出席首都各界慶祝大會席上，　蔣主席曾對全國軍民，頒致訓詞。這是這個歷史的塲合的歷史文獻，言雖簡短而意義却極深長。這是　主席凱旋還都首次昭吿全國軍民。在這篇訓詞裏面，　主席昭吿我們：「…我們就應該痛定思痛，時時不忘不忘我門八年來在敵人鐵蹄之下所受的奴隸，牛馬，暗無天日的生活，更不能不警惕眼勉，自立自强了。尤其是十五年前九一八東北瀋陽被俘之時，整個民族的奇恥大辱，更應深切牢記，作爲我中華民族世世代代永久的歷史敎訓。同胞們，所以今日政府還都，我以爲只能爲表示我們對日抗戰的結束，就是我們國民政府抗戰到底的國策，率領全體軍民同胞犧牲奮鬥得到一個勝利，但是我們今日瀋陽雖已收復，而東北整個的行政與主權的完整，還須要我們全國同胞爲國家爲民族精誠合作，繼續努力奮勉，來保持我們最後勝利光榮的戰果。惟有如此，方能安慰我們八年來爲抗戰革命而犧牲的軍民同胞在天之靈…」。的確，政府的還都不過表示我們對日抗戰的結束，我們還得繼續努力來確保我們最後勝利光榮的戰果—東北整個行政與主權的完整。在還都的歷史塲合。　主席特別指出這一點，是其含義深長，何待多言。</p>
<p>目前中國的情勢，我們一面看見有政府的凱旋還都，一面看見有共黨軍隊的到處袋動戰事，襲擊國軍。長春的攻占，以及東北方面戰事的展開，很明顯地是共黨軍隊破壞國軍接管東北的企圖，同樣的戰鬥行動，近且自華北伸展至蘇北，其目的無非在打學國軍，擴大共軍防區；凡此戰鬥行爲皆由共黨所發動，國軍在自衛的原則下不得不加以防衛，而共黨宣傳强以彼等所發動之攻勢爲防衛，爲內戰。凡此宣傳，原本止於智者。這樣公開的事實擺在國人面前，又有公正的第三者的客觀報道，在銷具一些智慧的人，必有是非之辨。這種明明是共黨在歪曲事實，破壞國家的統一而掀起戰事是不配稱爲「內戰」的。從國家的立塲，共黨的軍事行動是叛變而不是「內戰」。這是且無法紀不受節制不顧民族利益的謀叛行爲，論理是應該討伐予以懲處的；可是政府本和平團結之旨，未張討伐之師，這是政府顧念戰後民生的疾苦，不惜忍讓和平的一番苦心。人民需要和平，政府亦需要和平，不希望和平的是共產黨。且今各地人士頗有呼籲和平者，上海一部份人士，並有所謂「上海人民團體聯合會」之組織，呼籲和平。我們不得不特別指出這一點，就是政府需要和平同人民一樣股切，而破壞和平的是共產黨；我們需要和平，首先要制止共黨破壞和平的行動與企圖。我們不能顚倒事實，歪曲是非；倘使我們不加分析，籠統呼籲和平，是其結果，正足以縱容共黨禍國殃民，愈呼籲和平而和平愈不能確保。</p>
<p>我們又不得不指出的是東北局勢之發展到現階段，即東北整個行政及主權完整之尙未回復，更明顯的是由於共黨的破壞。根據中蘇條約，整個東北，原應由國民政府接管。共軍趁國軍未到達之前，紛紛調赴東北，阻撓國軍的接防，攻占城市，橫行不法，凡此均有公正第三者的客觀報道，除非別有用心，甘願作賣國奴的人以外，對於東北局勢的發展多有明確的認識。主權不可分割，領土不可分割，東北是中國的東北，中國人的東北。中國人民十五年來惟一的願望就是東北的收復，而收復東北是國民政府的責任。所以我們不能有任何藉口的特殊化；整個東北必須由國民政府加以接收，爲顧全客觀事實，馬歇爾特使所提共黨軍隊立即退出長春再談其它的提議，在性質上已經是一種讓步，因爲整個東北原應由國民政府收復，不應有任何問題，要求共黨退出長春再談其它已經是一種極大的讓步，在法理上是不應該有的讓步，但為顧全各觀事實，體念馬歇爾特使的一番至意，我們如果接受了這個提議，便不應該再有讓步。共黨所提「無條件停戰」云云，乃是攻占了地盤，不許中央接收之保陣，等於强盜搶了東西，即喊警察，不許開槍捕盜，根本無接納的理由。至於所謂東北問題應由東北人民投票表決云云，那尤其語近荒謬。東北是中國的東北，無須乎東北人民的投票表決，這與法德相爭的「阿爾薩斯羅蘭」兩省的情形，究屬不同，不能相提並論：所以「東北問題應由東北人民投票表決」這句話，不是中國人所應講的，這句話違反了中國的民族利益，跡近出賣民族利益的第五縱隊的行徑。</p>
<p>針對着目前的中國情勢，政府忍讓以求的是和平，人民懇切要求的是和平，我們爲人民呼籲和平，便只有懇切要求中共在關內外停止一切擾亂行動。共黨的攻勢，已自山海關外的東北，蔓延及於河北，山西，山東以及密邇京滬的蘇北。人民經了八年的戰禍，何堪再遭兵刧之災，政治上的主張與政策儘管可以有不同，我們應該以開明的方式爭取人民的同情，萬不能再呌飽經戰禍的人民重遭兵火之厄。中國是整個的，這既不是國民黨的中國，也不是共產黨的中國，而是中國人民的中國。政黨儘管可以有黨爭，但我們不能使人民加深其痛苦。目今加深中國人民痛苦的是中共的擾亂行動，為了人民，我們懇切要求中共停止一切擾亂行動。</p>
<p>爲了中國人民，我們又不得不指出另一宗事實。自政黨公開活動以來，其間政黨紛出：這裏面固然不乏忠誠謀國的政治集團，然亦有祗知為黨派乃至為個人爭地盤的無聊政客。「政協」以來的政治紛爭，為政策原則之爭者少，為地盤之爭者多，這在中國人民中已起了極不良的印象。我們要問晚近起來的「政黨」究竟能代表那一方而或若干人民的意向，這怕連各黨的領袖人物也無從回答。中國大多數的人民是無黨籍的，中國有這麼多的伊斯蘭敎信衆而沒有伊斯蘭敎衆所組織的政黨，有逾五百萬的基督敎信衆，其中四百萬以上是天主敎信衆，而沒有基督敎信衆所組織的政黨，或天主敎信衆所組織的政黨，可知大多數中國人民的意向是不能由這些少數政黨來代表的。尊重全國民意，我們就不能過於重視少數黨派的私見。我們必須從別方面來尋求人民的意向；少數黨派所能代表的民意，其間未必是民意的全貎。如今國府還都，與民更始，我們不得不特別指出這一點。</p>
<p>中國需要安定，世界需要安定。世界之能吾安定，持久和平之能吾確保，其間決定於中國局勢之推移者實深且鉅。這是「藩陽事變」及其後東北局勢的演變，掀起了世界第二次大戰。如今整個世界，包括中國在內，正自這次歷史的浩刦中過來；我們更應努力於安定的努力，和平的確保。茲者國府還都，几我國民，均應仰體　主席訓詞中的一番至意，爲國家，爲民族，精誠合作；繼續勢力，以確保我們最後勝利光榮的戰果。還都後，對國內政治作一展望，我們不能不率直地申述我們的意向。</p>

<h3>安理會否決權問題中澳反對蘇聯主張</h3>
<p>〔中央社紐約五日專電〕負責制定安理會程序規則之專家委會，對於否決權問題，原已最感棘手，茲因奧洲及中國反對蘇聯之主張擴大五强吾決權計劃，益使此項問題感覺困難，蘇對否決權之新提議，係載於蘇官方文件內，其內容爲「關於安理會所討論之問題，究寬是否屬於程序性質？又如某問題究竟屬於爭端或悄勢性質，及此問題究竟是否屬於聯合國憲家第卅三條所涉及者？」凡此諸問題之決定，如經安理會七理事國表決，其中並有安理會所有常任理事可決時，均得認爲通過。據聯合國觀察家解釋，蘇聯之提議將使吾決權之運用超過憲章所定原則以外，關於此點，聞我代表梁鋆立於最近專家委會開會時，力言蘇聯之建議，實已遠反在舊金山時各發起國家所作之保證，即吾決權之使用，應有節制根據，蘇聯之建議亦將使雅爾達之吾決權規定成爲無意義。聞目前僅法國在原則上贊成蘇聯吾決權之解釋，英美尙無表示，但一般推測，兩國均將遵照在雅爾蓮時所採取之同樣態度。</p>

<h3>一個地方性的自衛團體　訪問上海市保衛團　職務限於恊助軍警維持治安</h3>
<p>— 本報記者　渭清</p>
<p>一個純粹地方性的自衛團體—上海市保衛團，最初成立是在民國十三年，以後因成績卓著，逐漸由南市而擴展到閘北·浦東。漕河涇。雖然，當時因限於經費，並沒有像前租界萬國商團那樣的配備齊整，但經民國二十年上海市政府的保衛委員會指導後，慢慢地已加強了他的組織和實力，終於達到了「自衛衛人一的目的。</p>
<p>廿六年十一月十二日滬市淪陷，保衛團亦隨國軍西撤而宣吿解體，抗戰勝利後，錢市長應地方紳商的要求，在去年十一月十六日恢復組織，並將前租界萬國商團中華隊合併，成立上海市保衛總團，全市劃分滬東·滬南。滬西·滬北·滬中·浦南·浦北·吳淞等八個區國，由客有略·張錦堂·兩將軍分任總副團長。</p>
<p>記者爲欲明瞭該國成立以來的一般情形取工作概况，昨天特趨訪容總團長，他是黃埔軍校第一期陸大特四期畢業的，如果在他的談話態度上針去，會使你不信他是個久經沙塲的名將，尤其保衛衡陽一役，他和方軍長先覺。周慶祥·葛先才·饒少偉三師長，喋血孤城，達四十七天之久。容氏方從前天視察各區團歸來，他說：一般情形良好，惟現有各區團員的素質，認有提高的必要，所以已擬訂敎育實施綱領，頒發各單位積極訓練，預定在七月底可完成。</p>
<p>因爲槍械的不够分配，義我團員已決定减少人數，最近還在計劃成立各區敎護隊，義務服務社會，但是最困難的就是經費了。他又說：外界不明本國實際淸形，認爲我們經費寬裕，其實自成立以來，僅靠娛樂捐中百分之五十，及各界捐款維持，至今服裝費尙未能按期付淸，而市政府核准的娛樂捐補助費祗有六個月。實力方面，除各區團外，總團部尙有常備隊二大隊，特務像一隊，重機槍隊一隊，常備隊幹部均係正式軍官·團員·係經思想學術體格考試合格的青年，因爲本團全係地方性的自衛團體，所以職務僅限於協助軍警，維持地方治安。去年冬防時期，直接間接參加勤務人員最多時達三千二百四十名，又因各團員均能任勞任怨，熱心服務，在五個月中曾先後捕獲盜匪犯案八十餘件之多，滬北區團副官葉祖炳，且因捕盜而殉職，上月初又奉命看管日僑遺留房屋，並担任市郊防務及各處倉庫警戒，本月起更加强防務，所有各區團及常備大隊等，均一律參加勤務。</p>
<p>容氏是非常謙虛的，他說，他歡迎各界對保衛團的工作加以批評，如果有建議送給他們，他們是非常歡迎的。</p>
<h3>太古輪出口無期有　迄未改用華員引起嚴重交涉　海員工會向公司提出條件</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕怡和。太古·兩英商輪船公司，前因協運善後救濟品，暫准航行沿海綫。今太古公司已派定船隻，擬行展擴至廣州。前日到滬之新輪福州號，則因船員問題未解決，並牽涉濟南·湖北·兩輪，非但出口無期，即來貨除水菓外，其餘貨件均未能起卸。此次糾紛，關係我國海員前途至鉅。怡和係經　中印輪船公司之船舶，太古則係本行船隻。戰前行駛江海各綫，船有百餘艘之多。自日寇發動南侵後，兩公司船舶絡續南撤，自香港·新加坡。南洋各埠，而至印度。各輪除船長大副二副三副等高級船負係英藉外，其餘業務主任·舵工·艙底生火·艙面水手·及勤務等均係國人充當。各輪撤至南洋印度後，華人均被驅逐，以致犧牲者，或竟流爲乞丐，爲狀至慘。勝利後兩公司復業，並添建新輪，舊輪艙底艙面亦已起用華人。但新輪則係用南洋羣島土著，前日第三次來滬之太古福州輪，尙未改用華人。本市海員總工會，當即派員向太古交涉，略稱華籍海員在戰事時期，爲公司服務，犧牲者不可勝數，現既已復航，理應復工。並提出條件大意爲要求復工及撫卹死難家族。太古方面竟不予答復。上星期六海員向該公司英籍經理請願，亦不得要領而散。湖北·濟南·福州·三輪來貨，迄未能起卸。聞昨日太古英籍經理一度到海負工會協議，但無結果。在此事未解決前，三輪出口無期云。</p>
<h3>不合供直接救濟之物資　如何處理問題　美商會提備忘錄</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕「聯總」對華供應之救濟物資，常有不適合直接供善後救濟之用者。對於此類物資之處理問題，各界多所辯難。茲聞本市美國商會，特爲此事而向「聯總」駐華報行長奧姆斯坦氏，提出備忘錄，建議在不妨礙現有在華之貿易路綫下，無分國籍，規定其分配辦法。（一）美國之物資，應由美國商會設「聯總」聯絡組；英國則由英國商會設「聯總」聯絡組；負責與「聯總」取得密切聯絡，俾便獲悉「聯總」各種非救濟物品抵尊裝卸，及運送之情形，報吿各該商品之經常進口商。（二）推銷「聯　」非救濟物品，原則上美貨交由原美商經銷，英貨交由原英商經銷；設該貨原有其他國籍之經銷商者，則仍由該國籍之商人經銷。（三）有商標之商品，原已有特約經銷者，仍由特約者經銷。無商標之商品，且無特約之經銷者，則擇其經銷類似商品之經銷商經銷之（四）以前從未進口之商品，則由各商品來源國之商會，會商擇定適當之經銷商經銷之。該備忘錄結語有云：設上述建議付諸實施，將使中國之國際貿易日趨合理化，且「聯　」亦可因出售該項非救濟物資，而獲得較高之代價，以購備糧食，而從事其他救濟工作。</p>

<h3>金元王國物價管制政策下　黃牛投入了黑市</h3>
<p>— 本報廿五日紐約航訊駐美特派員毛樹清</p>
<p>復活節前後的一個星期，我第一次看見了美國的所謂一經濟失調」。這些情形，在我默洲的旅行期中，在踏上新大陸的第一脚以前，是絕對想像不到的。</p>
<p>在歐洲的許多美國軍營中，有堆積如山的麵包，黃汕和白總。許多軍曹先生們，管理廚房不耐煩了，拿一大把食品摔在地上。我坐威廉瑪麗號戰艦渡大西洋，船上，看見美國「老粗」們，把一箱箱的罐頭食品，丟到海衷。但是，到了紐的了，我反而看不見了牛汕。美國餐館的西崽，送上一小碟牛油給我，作一個鬼臉，我知道，他的用意，暗示這是莫大的「人情」。</p>
<p>看不見牛油火腿橱窗掛小塊牛肉</p>
<p>不僅是牛汕而已。耶穌復活節的禮拜犬，紐的市上，看不見了「火腿」。紐的日報的記者弗格遜和賈狄克，合作寫了一篇：「復活節你想吃火腿嗎」？他們說：火腿現在是沒有了，不僅你（指讀者）買不到，連我們新聞記者也買不到。「如果你想吃得好　一點，你可以改吃魚，羊肉，或者鷄鴨。」</p>
<p>「牛肉是有的，但要走黑市的路，牛肉商人，在官價牛肉的樹窗裏，掛着一小塊，但是你休想，那不會輪到你的。」</p>
<p>於是，紐約人感到苦痛了。五年來，平均每星期，紐的要消耗一百六十二萬七千八百五十一磅豬肉，宰殺六千六百零七頭牛。像紐的，將近七百萬人口的大都會，這數目是絕不能少的。兩洋的戰爭打勝了，紐的人反而沒有了肉喫。</p>
<p>農業部知道這問題重要，在復活節前二天，宣布將有一百三十三萬四千零八磅豬肉，六千二百七十六頭牛，在復活節的一個星期中，運抵紐的。紐約漁業公會的發言人歐文，也宣布每天將有七十五萬磅的魚，供給紐的市民的食用。</p>
<p>然而，紐的的老百姓，仍然不滿意。紐的記者公會，最近發出了一個具有幽默興趣的通告，決定四月二十五日晚上，在華道夫，阿斯脫大厦叙餐。他們宣稱：「爲運奉杜魯門總統的訓示，叙餐不備麵包牛油，俾能節約糧食，運輸出口』。據說，届時一千六百新聞從業員，爲不吃牛油運動，前往參加。艾森豪威爾元帥，將爲嘉賓之一。</p>
<p>艾帥會不會去參加記者公會的『盛案』？還有待事實來說明。反正，美國老百姓對於「節約』這個字，是極其聽不慣的。在電車上，有一位店員對我說：「如果美國人要講節約，戰爭老早就打敗了』。大部份的美國人，都相信祗有拚命的消費，纔能有大量的出產。</p>
<p>十二人實行罷工十萬人失了牛奶</p>
<p>實際的情形，也是如此。在美國買不到東西，並不是本身沒有東西，東西是有的，但制度把它桎梏住了。舉個淺近的例子說：復活節前幾天，紐約東岸「南漱』區一帶，（一度傳說將爲聯合國機構新地址附近），忽然十萬老百姓吃不到牛奶，原因是十二個牛奶工頭，爲要求加薪不遂而罷工，牛奶工廠的廠長安得烈不允，因之，好幾天就沒有牛奶上市。美國的嬰兒，多半是靠　牛奶長大的，這一下，可急壞了多少主婦。紐約鏡報在社會新聞欄喪，寫上了大標題：「十二人罷工，十萬人失奶』！</p>
<p>一直到現在，白糖在紐約，還是珍品。糖的生產和消費之間，還大大脫節。前些日子，最大的一家製糖廠，「東岸」糖廠，四千四百名工人，爲要求加薪罷工。東岸糖廠的生產量，佔全美百分之七十，因之，勞工部趕着出面調停，結果，每一工人，每小時工資增加一角五分，問題才獲得了解決。</p>
<p>此起彼伏的罷工運動，依然沒有終止。『金元王國』的經濟失調，越來越萬害了。於是，許多社會的賢達，都在尋求解決的方案，最後，他們認爲發現了：「一切罪惡都在物價管理局』。</p>
<p>共和黨發動總攻威考脫開第一砲</p>
<p>物價管理局是戰時生產的一個機構，是羅斯福當年的得意傑作之一。如今戰爭勝利結束了，物價管理局依然存在。因爲物價有管理，廠主對成品，不能隨便漲價，廠主對生產品，既不能隨便漲價，工人自然不能任意加薪。於是乎，工人罷工，生產减少，生產减少，市塲供應不敷，縱然物價再限制，也免不了處處「黑市』。這樣一來，原先想爲人民生活而管理物價，結果使人民生活更艱難。共和黨把這件事，作爲抨擊民主黨政府重要事件，經過幾次集議以後，在國會發動了總攻擊。</p>
<p>第一個開砲的是密歇根州的下院議員威考脫，他反對物價管制繼續展期到明年三月底。他說：限制物價將阻殺生產，我們再不能讓生產但落下去。他提出的口號是：「合理利潤。』，』爲什麼不讓資本家取得合理利潤，而將工人的工資，同時加高？』</p>
<p>同一天，在參議院的經濟金融小組委員會裏，俄亥俄州的共和黨參議員塔虎脫，力竭聲嘶的抨擊政府的穩定金融及管制物價方案，他說：『如果我是物價管制的負責人，我將放棄三分之二的項目，還其自由』。他不許反對者揷嘴，一直等他說完了，才准旁人開口。</p>
<p>芝加哥無猪肉吃只得以蔬菜代替</p>
<p>美聯社的記者，從芝加哥發回紐的的電報，說復活節的一星期，芝加哥沒有猪肉吃，屠宰商因爲政府物價管制，都不願營業，許多家庭主婦，「都以蔬菜代替」。</p>
<p>芝加哥是美國屠幸塲的中心，芝加哥的問題，立即反映到了華盛頓。參議院農業委員會的主席康姆士，爲肉類食品缺乏，發表談話，他說目前唯一補救的辦法，是馬上取消管制。</p>
<p>在農業委員會席上，芝加哥牛肉屠宰公司的襄理施威孚先生，要求取消管制，他說，在復活節前的一個星期之中，屠宰公司祗收到了一百八十五條黃牛。去年今日，同一個禮拜之內，買進了四千一百零三頭。</p>
<p>「爲什麽？政府限制了我們的購置價格。我們不能抬高價格向牧農收買，於是，黃牛部進了黑市。』</p>
<p>那天，會議席上，物價管制局的發言人佛蘭肯，說明所有農產品的價格，都經過農業部長安特遜會商決定的。他承認農產品現在都有了黑市，黑市價格，約高於官價百分之二十。</p>
<p>物管局長大怒吼解釋物價與通貨</p>
<p>辯論激烈的，還是在衆議院，物價管制局長保羅波特，親自爲市塲波動，詳細說明政府的對策，他說，政府何嘗不知道這些病象？但如果不管制了。物價爲上還大漲特漲。「物價一漲，通貨更膨脹一不已。今天，美國已經有了普遍的通貨膨脹的病態。如果再　通貨愈發愈多，人民的生活，將不堪設想』。他又嚴重指出：物價不管制，祗有增加資本家的利益，而置億兆民衆的利益於不顧。</p>
<p>保羅波特指出，現在美國的通貨紙幣，巳經發到二千二百五十萬萬美元之多。如果物價失去管制一年，則明年此日，物價又將漲百分之七十五，甚至百分之百。到那時，錢就變成了不値錢，購買戰時公債的，或者存款於銀行或保險公司的，都將無形蒙受勝買力减弱的損害。</p>
<p>「假定說，我現在在國會提議，凡是美國的所有私人資本，包括存款，動產，不動產，都一律由政府抽稅百分之五十。你們中一定有人會吿發我是共產黨或瘋人』。可見抽稅是做不到的。抽稅既做不到，物價買賣又自由放任，結果必定使籌碼加多，通貨膨脹，終至於民不聊生。</p>
<p>威考脫堅持成見准人民自由漲價</p>
<p>保羅波特的演講，很沉痛，也很懇切，有位議員反駁他：想用管制物價來收縮通貨，那是撤木求魚。</p>
<p>紐的州的共和黨衆議員華茲伍斯，抨擊物價管制最激烈。民主黨的議員分成了兩派，南部以農業爲中心的民主黨議員，表同情於共和黨，主張開放物價，提高農產品價格。</p>
<p>衆議院對於物價方案的表決，在復活週的星期四，那天上午的辯論最精彩，共和黨的健將威考脫大聲吼時：『生產第一，祗有生產，才能挽救當前的困難，」他堅持己見：「愈管制，愈糟糕，「因此，祇有取消管制，取消政府對生產業的「補貼政策』。威考脫說：『政府根本不需要補貼，自找麻煩，讓工商業者，自由漲價，一漲價，什麽生產都够了，』麻塞諸塞斯州的共和黨議員蘭耕，馬上起來附和他。</p>
<p>民主黨議員孟洛男，反對這些意見，他高呌：「全美國消費者的黑暗時期，已經來到。』共和黨的議員斯班塞，提醒衆院大家注意：『一個有組織的集體力量，正在圖謀推到爲民衆謀福利的物價管制局。但是，你們要注意全國百分之九十五的人民，他們會擁護管制政策，雖然，今天他們是毫無組織的一羣。』</p>
<p>另外，一位共和黨議員克勞福，他是擁護管制政策的，他指出：去年一年中，美國消費者，因管制政策所省下的金錢，達三百六十萬萬金元。</p>
<p>議長宣佈表決了，投票的結果，是二百五十九票對一百三十七票。　考特的提議得勝，二百五十九票之中，共和黨舉手的一百七十一人，南部民主黨黨員八十八人。</p>
<p>考脫提案的內容，是：（一）管制局的管制年限，本應延長至明年六月底的，提　三個月至明年三月底，完全結束。（二）各製造商，批發商，得在需要情形下，加訂「合法利潤」出售。（三）自七月一日起，取消豬肉屠商之補貼政策，開放肉價。（四）其他各貨物之補貼辦法，至今年年底，完全廢止。（五）物價管制局與工廠顧問委員會會商明年取消物價管制以後的步驟。</p>
<p>輿論界對於這件事，有兩種截然不同的看法，一種認爲從此以後，美國可以從戰時經濟的體系，回復到平時的局面，可以促成繁榮。但是大部份却認爲這是資本主義的經濟制度，在「開倒車」。</p>
<p>華盛頓主婦請願要求保留物管局</p>
<p>最愛影響的，恐怕是都市的小市民。物價管制局存在，雖然有幾天喫不到猪肉，但畢竟還能忍受。以後，物價自由暴漲了，通貨膨脹了，生活也許會大成問題。國會開會那大，華盛頓有好幾百個主婦，在國會門面前請願，要求保留物價管制局，不要　　本家爲所欲爲。</p>
<p>紐約「下午報」畫了一幅漫畫，一個黑臉孔的劊子手，絞殺了O.P.A.（物價管制局），旁邊許多老百姓伸着手喊：「我們需要他！」</p>
<p>另外，他還畫了一幅威考脫的兇險之相，下面註着：「百分之五的人，壓倒了百分之九十五的國民大衆」。</p>
<p>當天晚上，權威經濟學家，現任經濟穩定局的局長齊斯特，鮑吾耳。在美國廣播公司，發表了廣播，開頭他說：「我準備辭職不幹了」。接着他說，這次國會的行動，將造成美國經濟上的大災難，成千成萬的家庭預算毁滅了。這未來的一年之中，我們美國的千千萬萬消費者，將再也過不到舒暢的日子」！他說：「讓我們睜着眼睛看吧，看將造成如何艱難的後果」。</p>
<p>這一位權威經濟學家，有他的一套看法，早在一個月以前，他在「紐約時報」寫過一篇專論，他從各方面分析，美國繼續行進中的通貨膨脹，將是全世界經濟的隱憂，特別是美國本身的隱憂！（紐約）</p>
<h3>倫敦半年　漫談當前英國生活</h3>
<p>— 本報廿三日航訊特約記者雪岩</p>
<p>我們這羣初到英國來的學生，一上岸第一件感到不方便的是火柴很難買到，抽烟的同學，首先着急。逐漸逐漸，發現買不到的，或雖可買到而購買量限制甚嚴的物品，愈來愈多，上飯店需要排隊，住旅館到處客滿，盡是物資缺乏的現象，眞有點疑心倫敦不如重慶富有。我們一跟英國人談起，年紀老一點的，總是抽口長氣說：「光生，你是新來的旅客罷？你還不知道英國是戰窮了！英國人的財產，都化在打倒法西斯上去了。」</p>
<p>孩子喫香蕉大人嚥口沫</p>
<p>在消化常患不良的人，第一件苦事，是水菓絕對買不到，久住在倫敦的人，都說道六七年來，就沒有見過水菓的面，去年是勝利年，聖誕前後，總算運到了幾千噸香蕉，無綫電和報紙，都把它作爲重要新聞傳播。但是後來政府却又宣布爲量太少，祗能分配給小孩過聖誕節，於是大人祇好望着　口沫，小孩子個個笑逐顔開，見了一告訴他吃到了幾個香蕉。一次我跟一位英國主婦開玩笑，「你們英國人眞奇怪，全不喜歡吃水菓，市上就遍找不着水菓的影子。」她可動了眞氣說：「H先生，你到眞會尋開心，你董拿知道英國戰窮了嗎？我們以前天天少不了的東西，現在都不能不把它丟了。……我眞不知道Tommy（英國兵士）回來，要多失望。他們再不相信這是他們自己的國家了。出去爲人打了幾年仗，退伍歸來，發現祖國窮到了這田地。」言下頗有不勝今昔之感。</p>
<p>爲保障正義受最大犧牲</p>
<p>在戰前，英國的海外貿易和海外投炎，在世界上都是佔第一位的。但在這作戰期間，海外貿易，完全停頓，幾乎是等於零了。海外投資，不是遭敵人毁壞，便是抵押或出賣了。因此，與戰前相比，英國今日之窮是毫無問題的。所以不管外國人對她的印象怎樣，英國人本身，一致相信，英國是這次戰爭中犧牲最大的，爲了打倒法西斯主義而戰窮了。他們自己堅持着爲了打倒法西斯主義　戰，言外之意，即是說英國不是爲了本身的利害關係而戰，而是爲了正義原則而戰，也就是說他們的犧牲，是爲了保障正義的犧牲。眞的，英國人這種信念，是隨處可以看得出的。</p>
<p>冬天定衣服夏天穿上身</p>
<p>一個從印度初到英國的人，最光感覺不便的，是服裝。印度是在熱帶，一套淺色西裝，就可以度冬了。而英倫却在北國，倫敦的緯度，與滿洲里相同，雖在盛夏，也不致太熱。所以從印度初到英國，急需添製衣服，問題往往非常迫切。但是在英國，購買衣服，限制是很嚴的。第一，須有分配證，分配的申請與分給，大槪需時十天或二星期。請到以被，購買數量有限制，是不用講了，就是單說貝現成的服裝罷，你跑上門去，十家店舖中，到有七八家有樣品而無現貨，尋找也得費點腿勁。萬一身材不合，現成的服裝，穿不上身而必需定製時，那可眞走了運，店家異口同聲，都說勞工缺乏，要等六七個一月才能交貨，換句話說，即是冬天定的衣服，要至夏日才能上身，你想想這交易難不難。</p>
<p>禁造豪華貨專賣便用品</p>
<p>歐洲戰事的結東，到現在將近一年了，英國勞工缺乏的壓力，迄未輕减。因此一般貨品的素質，也普遍降落，凡是戰前屬於奢侈性的精製品，一槪禁造，充斥市塲的，盡是合乎實用，不講究式樣美觀的便用品（Utility），買來買去，什麽都是Utility，外衣是Utility，襯衣是Utility，毛絨還是Utility，家具是Utility，文具是Utility，連無綫電收音機也還是Utility。我們一班窮學生，到也罷了，因爲貪其價廉，有時反覺物美了。但是若十國內來的三四等要人，念念不忘戰前英國出的呢絨等織品，現在市上早已絕跡了，於是他逢人打聽，到處碰壁，看他實在傷心。我們做學生所最感覺頭痛的，無過於　買書籍的困難了。作戰期間，因爲紙張，新舊書籍，幾乎全部停印，連報紙雜誌的印量，限制也很嚴，定一份泰晤士報，要等上六七個月，買部牛津小字典，要搜尋幾十家書舖子，還不一定有着落，至於較生瘃的參考書，更是够你跑了，尋遍倫敦，未必能找到一本對勁的。</p>
<p>食品有配給營養可無慮</p>
<p>到歐洲來的人，都躭心營養不足，我們在國內久已聽慣此說，在印度也聽人傳說，後來在船上與同船的英國士兵，所談的也無非是英國糧食缺乏的情形，心中多少有點不安。迨船近英倫時，船上更利用廣播，解釋英國目前的生活狀況，大致說在戰爭期間，英國犧牲如何重大，所以現在生活還非常困難。用意是要讓將到英國的旅客，和歸國士兵，有個準備智識，不致到英國後太失望。若干善於杞憂的同學，聽了更爲寒心。但實際到了英國，都遠不似想像中爲難，主要食品，都是實行分配制的，每人每週約可得牛奶二磅，雞蛋一個或二個不定，肉類數磅，糖菓罐頭之類，也勉強够吃，如果仍感不足的，可以上館子去打牙祭。所以食單雖然單調，口味也不合式，但並無營養不足之慮。而且凡是分配到的東西，都是價格低廉，初從國內來的人，看到這樣便宜東西，也不禁興高采烈，精神百倍。</p>
<p>管制合理化大家獲享受</p>
<p>如果我們單從一方面去看英國，或不免疑心英國眞已窮透了骨。實則也並不如此，據很多英國學生自己說，單說我窮是不很準確的，或則說窮而不窘，比較合理些。實際上，此次戰爭結果，英國一部分人的享受標準，雖不免降低些，但一般人的生活，却因政府魯制得宜，更有保障，更平等，更台理化了。譬如說牛奶鷄蛋，戰前固然隨處可以買到，但未必人人皆能經常享受，反之，現在因分配結果，人人有同樣權利，絕無例外了。Utility的用品，雖不能與戰前奢侈的精製品相比，但就實用而言，也已經够好。而且價格低廉，家家戶戶，可以購買。即就一般物價而論，在五年作戰期間，約共漲上二倍至三倍，這是很難得的了，縱在美國那樣物資豐富的國家，物價也漲的比英國快。所以平心靜氣的講，英國物價的管制，可說很有效。大多數英國人也認爲滿意。至於管制特別有效的原因，最主要的自然是因能控制物源。英國是島國，一切物資，都靠海外供給，政府旣控制了交通工具，事實上也即是掌握了物資的來源供給，政府旣控制了交通工具，事實上也即是掌握了物資的來源。物資旣在政府手中，分配自然容易合理，價格控制，自然也容易奏效。我們幾乎可說，英國是管制物價的理想國家。其次，是制度的縝密，政府要管制某宗物品時，事前皆有切實的估計籌劃。我們知道每一物品的價格，皆與其他物價，息息相關，要實行有效管制，先要把影響物價的一切因素，都打算在內，縝密準備，然後實行。人民依法辦理，便處處通行，步步合柏，絕無問題。反之便到處要闡亂子的。若僅憑內閣大員的一時高興，令飭公安局長與商會會長去抑平物價，其結果必然無效，而反有刺激物價上漲的作用。最後嚴格執行，也是成功的重要原因之一，在分配制下，不容許有半個例外，一人如可自外，其餘的人，自可起而效尤，舉個例說，譬如英國的平時工業，現正在逐漸恢復，人造絲襪（Ngon）廠，已開始復工，一天英國的瑪麗皇太后和伊利沙白公主前往參觀，廠方送他們絲襪各一雙，但同時卻要求他們把分記證送來，因為廠方售到多少原料，需用多少人工，便應該收回多少分配證來，是有定額的，雖對皇室，亦不容許有例外。皇室如可例外，內閣大臣，又何嘗不可例外，等而下之，就艱難再有例內了。</p>
<p>黑市在英國不成爲話題</p>
<p>話到這裏，也許有人要問，英國有沒有黑市呢？我的回答很乾脆，是：「有，但是在英國要買黑市東西，比在國內買官價東西還難」。從國內初到倫敦的人，總要問起英國黑市情形，彷彿比英國人還關切，假如回答「很少」的話，他們似還不够過癮。至於自英國回國的人，喜歡侈談英國的黑市，更不話下了。我在國內時，就聽見過好幾回。大概英國必有黑市是沒有問題的，不過我們到倫敦也快半年了。雖然在報上也見過處罰黑市商人的消息，但沒有親眼見過一次黑市買賣。同學們彼此見面，偶然也有談到黑市的，大家雖明知其有，但都沒有親身經歷過。實際上在英國的人，很少談到黑市，到是在印度時，常聽人談起英國黑市，津津有味，足見黑市在英國國內，不成爲談資，到是從黑市國家到英國的人，對英國黑市生意的不發達，有點詫異，所以盤問得特別起勁。幾位到英國來匆匆開會，又要匆匆回國的人，對於黑市調查，要算最熱心了，但調查幾個星期，等到臨行的時候，還祇在熱心的調查時期，沒有得到可　門路，所以我更相信黑市在英國不發達了。</p>
<h3>蛻變期舞女的血淚生涯！　「蓬拆姑娘」在杭州</h3>
<p>— 本報四日航訊特派員儲裕生寄</p>
<p>在杭州，擴　機裏充滿着紹興的樂曲，但是在湖濱一帶，散播着「戀之火」「歌女忙」等的樂調，這是從舞廳裏流溢到馬路上來的，是勝利後新的娛樂塲所。</p>
<p>這些舞廳曾遭地方上人士的反對，省參議會曾請政府取締舞女，不准開設舞廳。原因自有舞廳以來，許多爭風吃醋的事，時時在演出着，而且杭州是個樸質美麗的城市，如果這些有傷風化的事流傳開來，豈不要有　天堂的聖潔？</p>
<p>一旦廢舞　讓舞女們嫁人</p>
<p>一位在浙江有相當地位的某君，曾與記者談及舞廳和舞女的事，他不主張取締舞女和不准開跳舞應。他說：「杭州是世界馳名的名勝聖地，今後歐美人士來遊玩的一定很多，倘使沒有舞女和舞廳，豈不掃興？而且跳舞確是一種正當的娛樂，難道我們還主張男女授受不親嗎？」</p>
<p>公說公有理，婆說婆有理，在杭州的舞女，確有一部份不大好，但跳舞也不一定是一件大逆不道的事情。存廢問題也確爲當前的問題，現在市政府當局仍在徵收跳舞娛樂捐，省政府常局却特別派員在研究是否到底要取締禁止？省政府的人曾問：「要不要取締舞女？」有人回答說：「她們的出路問題如何？」省政府的人說：「可以讓她們嫁人呀！」</p>
<p>八十舞女　公佈四家舞廳</p>
<p>在杭州，舞廳共有四家：一爲中國酒家，在迎紫路；一爲西園，在英士路；一爲西湖酒家，在延　路；一爲金谷酒家，在延　路金城飯店轉角處。這四家舞廳，中國擁有二十五個舞女，西園有二十個舞女，金谷有十五個舞女，西湖有十個舞女，約略計來，大概有八十來個。若與上海比較，眞是大巫見小巫了。這四家舞廳，舞池當以中國爲最大，但也遠不如上海的百樂門，麗都，仙樂斯等，僅相等於上海咖啡店裏的較大舞池而已。</p>
<p>某一大班　被稱爲閻羅王</p>
<p>他們每張舞票價格爲二千四百元，其分配爲市政府娛樂捐九百元，舞廳得六百元，舞女大班得三百元，舞女得六百元。共如上數。舞女大班，則專門收　少女，爲其裝扮，敎舞，然後應市。其大班爲男子，舞女見大班都很畏懼。中國酒家，有一大班，舞女們稱之爲「閻羅王」，他擁有杭州市半數以上的舞她。的家呌他「紅大班」這許多舞女都口操上海話，問她們「府上那裏？」她們總喜歡說「上海。」其實，這裏邊至底有多少是上海人，是一問題。她們受敎育的程度，都不見得十分高，一般的講，大槪都是小學的程度，有幾位提筆寫字有些吃力。偶有一二個是高初中程度的，聽說最近上海去的白夢英，她是高中程度的。</p>
<p>蓬拆姑娘　不能目爲舞女</p>
<p>我曾和幾個舞女談舞的理論，她們瞠目不知所對。她們說：「我們只知道一們蓬拆走一步。」所以她們實在不能稱爲舞女，也不能稱爲伴舞的姑娘，而僅能稱爲「蓬拆姑娘。」</p>
<p>有一個舞女說：我們張桌子六百元，最紅的舞女每晚最多坐六張桌子，則三千六百元，一個月也只有十萬〇八千元。買雙襪子，買雙皮鞋已經快完了，還有什麽好處可言，有些人還有父母弟妹，要靠她養活，在沒有辦法之中，只有和舞客們親近親近，藉以得着一點好處。</p>
<p>另有一個舞女說：「×××睡在旅館裏，碰見査房間的，他們問地什麽職業，她說是舞女，於是要她跳一隻裸體舞。」「又有一團，幾個穿制服的人跑到舞女宿舍裏，硬要×××陪他們出去玩，吾則就要拿出手槍來！」「×××挨了穿制服的一嘴巴。」「×××被人硬留在外面過了幾夜。」</p>
<p>這些舞女們，穿備時髦的服裝，戴着金鑽的手飾。但是聽她們談起來，都有一段受委屈的傷心話。舞女到今天，已變成了下等的姑娘了。</p>
<p>共同公　　伴舞不是賣淫</p>
<p>在杭州的市民對舞廳問題發生濃厚興趣的時候，省市的婦女會，曾爲她們組織了一個舞女生活改進會，由她們舞女中自任主任和副主任，每週舉行生活改進座談會一次，並且不久要把她們加以訓練。</p>
<p>我曾參加過她們的座談會，她們的主席羞澀得話都不能講。後來她們討諭到生活的問題，覺得六百元張舞票的收入太少，要求增加，吾則罷舞。舞女宿舍裏，深夜一時後和早上七時前，不可讓吝人來往。宿舍太骯臟，要求舞廳設法整潔，以維衛生。</p>
<p>省市婦女會，並且提出舞女們北同的公約，要求大家遵守，劈顯第一條，就是「伴舞不是賣淫。」</p>
<p>情願做工　不願充當舞女</p>
<p>有一個年紀輕的舞女說：「我情願做工，不願再做舞女，但是希望得一做工，也是一件難事」</p>
<p>我們曾參觀她們的宿舍，十幾個人一間房，房內的光錢不大充足，在陰暗中她們趕忙地拿着鏡子，打扮裝飾，換上時髦的服裝，强顏歡笑，預備上茶舞會去了。在她們沒有化裝前，個個黃　般的臉，沒有睡醒的倦眼，都顯示她們的身世。</p>
<p>她們自己也在說，要尊重自己舞女的人格，但是有限的敎育程度和正在年青的時候，怎經得客人們的引誘？雖然有些有經騐的舞女，也曾騙取了客人們的金錢，但那比得靈魂的出賣？我曾問：高中程度的舞女如何呢？她們吿訴我，「高中程度的姊妹，想得開，所以更浪漫些啊！」</p>
<p>她們不曾想一想，恐怕也不敢想自己的前途，是的，可以嫁人啊！但是，嫁給誰呢？舞廳在杭州，演變到現在這種情形，這個責任又是應該誰負的呢？</p>

<h3>哈佛大學校長　論美國敎育</h3>
<p>〔美國新聞處紐的五日電〕哈佛大學校長康能德，最近在紐的時報著文，曾提出下列各項問題：</p>
<p>提出各項問題</p>
<p>（一）在未來，我們是否應該以帮助每一個有志者進入大學爲目的？（二）假使是的，那麼我們又應該用什麽方法去甄別誰能上大學？和誰不能入大學攻讀？（三）以四年爲期的文系畢業生，是否會過多，而造成一大批失業者，使他們對於本身所經歷的敎育制度，特別發生怨恨？康能德博士說：「美國士兵權利法宣佈後，大批人將入大學攻讀，在數年內，目前的緊急情形或可消逝，但是這種畸形的發展。可能影響長期的敎育計劃。「我以爲美國最高超和最重要觀念之一，就是機會的均等，過去如此，現在也如此。這種觀念，在一方面是一種變更的流動社會機構，而在另一方面，却是各職業與經濟單位的互相尊重，簡而言之，對於階級，絕無厚薄之分。在過去五十年中，敎育的力量一直都在爲美國而推進，由於擴充普遍敎育到高等學校制度的結果，已經造成了美國民主的有力工具。我們距離機會均等的目標愈近，（機會均等，事實上是永遠不能達到的），而同時我們的學校，也用更好的方法，敎導與實施美國民主的基本原則，那麼，個人自由的機會就愈多。」</p>
<p>發展公共敎育</p>
<p>康能德博士主張偱着兩種方向發展公共敎育：（一）建立更多類似初等大學的機稱，因爲大多數的靑年，如果在高中畢業之後，再受兩年的職業敎育訓練，也就很可以應付許多門類的職業了。（二）建立國家支持的獎學金制度，俾使有特殊技能的靑年，都可被還派到職　和高等的敎青中心去攻讀。康博士說：「爲了要達到這兩種目標，國家必須支出充分的敎育經費。」他又指出：「就大部份美國人民來講，一個聰明的青年是否能受到比高中更高的敎育，也須由家庭經濟狀況來決定。城市的高等學校和以城市靑年納付很少的學費，就可得到更大的敎育，而小鎭和農村的青年却不能享受這一點，祇有政府支付經費，才能促進小鎭和農村的敎育機會。」</p>
<p>達成機會均等</p>
<p>康能德博士的結論稱：「對於極重要的訓導靑年的責任，決不能予忽視，因爲它是一種展泛敎育制度的基石，其目的在達成機會均等的原則。當我們展望敎育前途的時候，我們希望能够改推訓導制度，擴大公共敎育，用賢明的方法發展我們最大的國本—兒童，因而增强我們的自由社會。」</p>

<h3>蘇北失學青年　拋棄家鄕流浪街頭　日無食夜無宿　冀求社會給予同情並有效恊助</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕蘇華中學旅滬避難同學會，頃發表吿名界書云：「母校蘇華中學，誕生於抗戰的初年，育成於紊亂中的蘇北，具有戰地敎育之特徵，純軍事化的色彩，致引起了敵僞匪的無限的仇恨，一遭敵人的破壞，再遭僞軍的催毀，三遭奸匪的蹂躪，而我不屈不撓的仁慈厚愛的校長周匯　先生，至再至三的肩負着學校的責任，不懈的領導着我們，走向抗戰的大道，因之遭忌益深，在敵僞匪的環境之下，他終於被匪綁去，校舍校具等全部被匪焚毀，事雖近於殘忍，而益增我們對匪之認識與抗戰之決心。嗣後不久，我們校長雖安然脫險，我們仰望他繼續領導我們，栽培我們，可是他終於奉了現在第三方面軍司令官湯恩伯將軍電召而去。從此我們失了憑依，成了迷途的羔羊。去年他隨勝利歸來，而我們散失在蘇北各縣的同學們，益陷於悲慘的命運，如奸匪探知我們有在蘇華讀書者，初則加以監視，繼則即行被害，據見聞所及，因之遭慘殺者，竟有六七十人之多。如此，不得不使我們離別了我們的父母兄弟姊妹，拋棄了我們可愛的家鄉，走向那邁深的流亡的造路。現在麕集在上海者，不下百餘十人，有依親靠友者，有流浪街頭者，甚至日無食，夜無宿，嗷嗷待助者，不乏其人。我們不但仰望我們的校長來領導我們，更冀求社會人士與我們以同情，與我們以有效的援助，庶乎使我們不致誤入歧途，不致成爲異域之路殍。」</p>

<h3>債市昨又遷回老巢　業中買氣蓬勃　股票仍爲銀根所扼</h3>
<p>公價昨實行遷回老巢活動，大有響應還都之風，業中興高彩烈，買風遂由散戶游資凑集而成，統丙晨開六三〇〇元，開後再哄抬至六八〇〇元，前數日大戶所吸收之籌碼，再來脫售，不久盤跌至六一五〇左右，新張伊始，逢低亦不乏見機維持者，午刻仍能回升至六四〇〇元以上，結果較上週六續升四五〇元，統丁平而甲乙戊各好一百元，華股扼於銀根，業中無法暢所欲爲，不脫初穩後疲老調，晨開後最高時永紗爲五三五〇元，美亞四五五〇元，景福四五五〇元，新光三六五元，動興三一八元，入後遂節節下游，午刻都呈低價，永紗過程最爲遜色，低價達五〇五〇元以下，結果較上週六計永紗美亞所跌極微，景福新光勸興信和榮豐則跌半成左右，其餘榮辱俱少，元老股又呈不振，外股欲起無力，怡紗初開曾見一四四〇〇元，惟屬曇花一現，俄頃復迫於銀根，證券帮多頭無法持久，漸漸下挫，午收較上週六冷熱各股均續小挫。</p>
<h3>金鈔均疲</h3>
<p>烚赤昨先穩繼疲，報載黃金大量運滬，以及歐美金價低於東亞頗多等訊，持有者逢高紛售，以致晨開後即自一六六萬逐漸下挫，十時後在一六二萬以下徘徊，中行配給二八一條，價减至一六〇萬元，人心轉淡，加之中紡紗布結款五十萬萬元，抽緊銀根不少，午刻遂破入一六〇萬關內，午刻曾退至一五七萬五，而後始稍穩定，結果較上週六回跌五萬五，銀樓飾金十七萬一，紋銀一千七，銀元一千零八有賣，暗拆銀根仍緊，息價仍站住二角內外　外幣美紗鬆動逾恒，套頭自七一〇元內拔開至七二〇元有零，需要較淡，實貨塞出，過程不見佳妙，農開二三三〇元後，先因金價回小而盤降，迨後銀根甚緊，供源陸續增加，午刻已迫近二二〇〇元關，午後終吿打破，結果較上週六回跌一百元，港票自四四五元退至四三〇元左右，結果回挫五元，港電四百三四，羅比五四〇元，均有供給，美匯亦平。</p>
<h3>現棉交易暢盛</h3>

<h3>煤價平定</h3>
<p>白煤因海防方面，有工潮發生，來源受阻，然天津方面績有零星到貨，又加滬地白煤存底尙豐，故市價仍平定愈恒，烟煤屑外埠去路轉稀，滬地實銷又呆，行情再吿不支，惟烟煤塊因此次同業配給貨數量極微，市况尚稱穩定。</p>
<h3>食糖標價減低</h3>
<p>昨糖市以銀根既緊，而實銷未暢，故趨勢仍極平庸，公會劃盤，中砂白初爲六萬，旋至五萬九千五百元至五萬九千元，又標售糖一批，計三半車白一千六有包，六萬三千元，小二千元，成交六百六十六包，生砂一千八百包，五萬二千元，跌二千元，僅成交一百八十包，又某公司開出油包貨一批，稅單均已渦期，價較低，計粗白七萬二千元，四半車白八萬五千元，荷赤九萬元，合靑三萬六千元，貨品均較遜，成交數百包，號方開出刁靑四萬八千元至四茁九千元。</p>

<h3>珠蘭茶　存戶居奇不售</h3>
<p>珠蘭茶，日來貨方居奇，蓋因新貨上市尙需時日，而陳茶目津帮胃納轉佳以來，市上存底日趨薄弱，故人心一味看好，趨勢遂造成供不應求之象，行情穩秀，至於其他花色，本街及蘇州帮均有添置，底盤各露鞏固，洋莊茶市目前菲洲摩洛哥等地，對於抽珍蝦目綠茶需求仍亟，惜因交通關係，以致迄今未見展開，聞本市某洋行擬設法轉繞運銷云。</p>

<h3>倚老賣老</h3>
<p>— 程鐵安</p>
<p>我偶然聽得，有人在發表『中國好」的識論：</p>
<p>他說：『中國的東西，有永久性，西安石碑最近時的，已有一千二百多年了，勒刻的字，還很明晰；廣西境內一只的古銅鐘，遠是秦漢遺物，敲起警報鐘來，還是非常宏亮……</p>
<p>「中國的紅木器物，祗要保管得好，却是越用越漂亮。</p>
<p>「中國兵行軍時，距離戰塲還遠的時候，已疲憊　現了，可是到了前綫，打起仗來却有驚人成績。」</p>
<p>中國就是吃了「倚老賣老』的虧。以爲自己是有數千年歷史的文物之邦，可以安如磐石。人家在向前跑，它還是立着不動，跨耀着他的「老』。</p>
<p>吿訴你：「現在已不是「賣老』的時候了』。</p>
<p>特寫</p>
<h3>太陽廟</h3>
<p>— 呂厂最</p>
<p>太陽廟，這樣生疏的地名，知道的人當然是不多的。就是有些知道的人，也會以爲這是不値　一談的地方</p>
<p>這生疏而又値不得一談的地方，現在我若不特地把它介紹一下，我想此後恐怕難得有人去理它了。因爲住在這裏的人，像我這樣認識幾個字的，簡直就很少。就是有些認識幾個字的人，一大到晚爲了生活，喘着氣，流着　，連大小便的餘裕也沒有，要想他們記一記太陽廟的事，這是斷乎辦不到的。我現在因爲停掉生意，有氣力沒有人要，坐在草屋裏無事做，所以就利用這空閒，祖略地將我們太陽廟的景况介紹一下。</p>
<p>太陽廟，是閘北的一部。火車從北站開出後，經過的第一座鐵橋，就是本區域的轄境。這裏的特色，就是沒有林森西路一帶的洋房子，述瓦屋也少見，都是些低了頭才可進去的草屋子。</p>
<p>太陽廟，該是天天有太陽可見到的地方吧？太陽也許天天是有的，但我們住在太陽廟的，確是離得看見太陽。多數的人，天未亮就得到工廠門口去候班。由廠裏帶了滿身疲勞出來的人，一進了草屋子，衣服也來不及脫就睡倒了</p>
<p>住在這裹的人，會聯想到太陽之可寳貴，那就可怕了。但他們若眞懂得太陽之可貴，也就不會到太陽廟來住了。不過，雨下久了，路上全化爲泥漿，難於舉步，屋子義濕到發霉，連呼吸也感困難時，他們也希望太陽出來，把路晒乾好走路，把屋子裏的霉氣趕了好睡覺。</p>
<p>在這裏的居民，到小沙渡，國家渡一帶工廠賣氣力的佔最多數，其次就是拉洋軍的。</p>
<p>賣氣力和拉洋車的，一般人以爲差不多都是江北人。其實不然，從江北一帶來的固佔了不少的成分，而從其他各地來的也不在少數。他們往往一批一批挑了全家的財產步行到上海。我房子沒有「金條』，於是多數是聚集到此地來。他們一到此地，不到三天，空地上就有一個新村落發見。太陽廟的興盛，也全靠這些源源而米的難民。</p>
<p>太陽廟，也是一個告人們最看不起的地方，因爲這義是貧民窟—難民或叫化子的部落。衣服梢爲整齊一點的人。便不屑到這裏來，聽說是怕得了傳染病。就退坐在京滬或滬杭車上的人客，看見這一帶的草屋子，心裏不生獻惡的就很少。有些初到中國的外國人，則帶着輕　與篤奇的眼光東張西望。</p>
<p>不錯，如果你坐火車向西行，出了北站，就看見鐵軌旁邊，染了一這長的五六里的水泥牆。我起初不明白築它是什麼用意，後來朋友吿訴我，才恍然大悟：原來已經是十幾年前的事了，有些闊人們，當所乘的火車經過太　　時，就要不舒服。以爲火車經過的地方，不應看見這一大准不睢觀的草屋子。尤其是由陸路跨入上海之門，首先就碰到一塌糊塗的草屋，本國人看了倒不在乎，給外國人見了，不僅有煞大上海的風景，連中國的體面也丟了。起先主張把它完全拆除，後來變通辦法，改築了這道水泥牆，把鐵路與太陽廟一帶隔開了。可惜因爲經過這次戰爭，好些地方已經破壞，在車上從空隙中還可以望見那另一面的眞象。</p>
<p>我們這裏沒有路燈，實際也不需要路燈，到晚上有些人甚至還怕見火光。也沒有報攤。識字的委實是太少了，國家無論發生了什麼大事，消息不會傳到這裏來，號外或晚報，從來也不到此地來叫費的。電話恐怕至多不超出二具，所以一起了火災，救火車非到滿天通紅是不會開來的。</p>
<p>太陽廟也可以說是無鷄無犬的區域。鷄固然等不到養大就要失踪；即外來的野狗，一入此境，能活到一個鐘頭以上的，便算萬幸了。不過，猪倒不少，而待遇都很不壞，與人同住在一個屋裏</p>
<p>淸晨，路旁往住會發貝蒲包包着剛出世的嬰兒。有的早死了，有的却還活着，等野狗來完結他們的生命。嬰孩如有知，像這樣一個不見太陽的世界，我想他們亦無所用其流連的。</p>
<h3>「脚踏實地」</h3>
<p>— 陳山</p>
<p>據丙地來人談，現在內地的大學敎授，生活眞是苦得不得了；收入少，開支大，沒有辦法，只好召找副業：請他的太太種作當爐女。譬如她是下江人，那她可以燒些下江菜和做些什麽點心。出售，有的還叫們的孩子到街上去兜賣。起初大家還怕不好意思，不敢公然如此，後來生活逼人兇，實在沒有辦法，於是一致行動，倒也沒有什麽希罕了。</p>
<p>有一個老敎授，他是一個科學家，事門研究生物學的，已敎了數十年的書了。大家見了他，總是和他開玩笑地說：你眞是「脚踏實地』，他也居然受之無愧。原來他脚上所穿的皮鞋底，早已破壞不堪了，可是他還沒有錢買新的，老是穿着那雙破皮鞋，依然起勁的硏究着生物學呢。</p>
<h3>過敏症和遺傳</h3>
<p>— 重樊</p>
<p>過敏症和遺傳有關係。硏究過敏症專家的美國　隆斯博士說：人們由於遺傳，有一種患過敏症的傾向，但病徵却因人而異，不是一致的。假使父母都有某種過敏症，孩子往往在十歲之前顯出遺傳的現象；假若父母中有一人患有某種過敏症，孩子往往在十歲以後才顯出這傳的現象。但有時父母雖都患某種過敏症，孩子也許並沒有過敏症的徵象，所以萬隆斯博士說，生理學是變幻不定的。</p>
<p>社會</p>
<h3>「洗臉不洗𩓐」</h3>
<p>— 水</p>
<p>人的臉，原來是爲了整潔，美觀才洗的。</p>
<p>照規矩講：臉和　頸兒連着，而且都是露在衣領外面的，所以在洗的時候，就應該將　子，耳朶一齊洗，那才來的漂亮，乾凈。但是竟有好多馬虎，和只講外表的人們，洗起來總是那麽洗兩把，草草完事。結果也就弄得『臉蛋兒』挺漂亮，而　子上呢？却是「黑漆亮光」地那麽難看。</p>
<p>因此，家鄉人曾稱之爲『洗臉不洗　」</p>
<p>本來，像這種粗魯的話，原是極通俗而不會讓人感到驚奇的，但是你若仔細地琢磨一下，那便是一句『語雖滑稽，而却含理極深』的諷刺之談。</p>
<p>不信，我這里吿訴你兩個答案：</p>
<p>第一：筆者在保定讀中學的時候，校長侮次紀念週或是召集學生目治會職員訓話，總是這樣說：靑年人作事，要不數衍，不作弊，更要脚踏實地，幹的徹底，尤其不要專講皮毛。譬如：你們的講室，宿舍搞好了，你們的茅厠，飯廳，廚房，同樣更應弄得整齊，淸潔，不然那就應了鄉下的一句話：「洗臉不洗　」。</p>
<p>第二：馮王祥將軍的治軍森嚴，是婦孺皆知的。當年他侮次檢査軍營整潔的時候，總是先看茅厠和庫房，講堂，兵舍他反而不去。什麽道理？他這樣說：「胭脂和粉總是擦在面上的。講堂兵舍管保是：被子摺的像方　，槍枝擺的像魚鱗兒似的那麽整齊淸潔，而那茅厠和庫房呢？一定會馬虎從事的。因此講堂，兵舍則寗肯不去，但是茅厠和庫房我却不能不走一遭。』因爲這兩種地點的重要，正是可與講堂，兵舍相提並論，劃爲一欄的。</p>
<p>所以，馮將軍當年常以下面之口語勗其部下：「這種事，正如人洗臉一樣，假設你的面孔洗的白白的，然而你的　子却黑漆亮光的不洗一下，結果，當你那黑　頸兒被人發現的時候，你的漂亮的面孔已被黑的　頸兒弄醜了。那時你的臉蛋兒即使有多麼漂亮，還有什麼用呢！這豈不是應了：「洗臉不洗　』的那句話？』</p>
<p>願全國上上，下下，大大，小小的官員和老百姓們，請你們目已捫心自問一下，你們是不是也犯着這種「洗臉不洗　』的毛病呢？</p>
<p>隨筆</p>
<h3>苦難的日子過了</h3>
<p>— 楊謀</p>
<p>日本投降，友朋相晤，都熱誠相賀：「苦難的日子過了。』但是新的陰曇罩住了整個大陸，大家都担心着陰惡的預兆大有山雨欲來風滿棋的感慨。</p>
<p>國共停戰令文下，這一次可眞的該相賀：「苦難的日子過了。」勝利帶給了我們破坯的結束，團結才帶給我們建設的開始。</p>
<p>打開我們國家的近代史，眞是血和淚凝成的一頁。內憂外患，天災人禍，沒有一刻間斷過。如今才算一筆勾銷，廢墟上，要重建起我們的樂園來！</p>
<p>苦難的日子過了！我們歡欣！但是，我們要格外的堅忍耐勞，努力奮鬥，才可保證我們不再有第二次苦難的日子氏！</p>
<p>偉大的時代已經開展在我們面前。祖國需要我們把血，把汗，灌注在大地上，培育出美麗燦爛的奇葩。聽！祖國正在號召我們！</p>
<p>苦難的日子過了！但是這決不會容許茍安和自私。過去八年中，多少烈士的血汗，已經奠定了國家的母根，現在，現在需要發葉開花結實了！</p>
<p>我們生在這一個時代，我們該爲自己慶幸。</p>

<p>美國各大火車站即將採用一種新式的售票機器，機器自印自售，十分迅速，購票的不必擁擠等候，車站的職員也不會鬧得手忙脚亂。</p>
<p>據說這種機器並不是一種新發明，乃是一百五十年前，一個英國人設計製造的，歐洲各國已採用了多年，不過美國用的曾略加改良，大小和收銀機相似，可以印出一百種不同的站名，印出的車票的兩吋見方，上面有起點同終點，日期，票價，號碼，以及其他的說明等。</p>

<h3>根絕迎神賽會</h3>
<p>— 沈振聲</p>
<p>每年屆浴佛節，農村各地，便普遍舉行一種迎神賽會。雖然這種迎神賽會，足以糜財傷物，然而在農村中，不論迷信的，不迷信的，無不興高彩烈，來襄贊這個迎神賽會。推其原因，實有下列數項；</p>
<p>（一）迷信—以爲可藉神佛之力量，驅除人間的瘟疫，以及植物的瘟疫。</p>
<p>（二）調劑精神性質—農村終年忙　，並無調劑精神的地方，於是在春光明媚，鳥語花香的時候，來一次逢塲作戲。</p>
<p>（三）出風頭性質—自暴日發動戰事以後，發國難財的，不知多多少少？他們一面存求神佛保護的思想，一面存出風頭的思想，於是大出錢財，來襄贊這個迎神賽會。基於以上三項原因，所以雖在生活程度極端高漲，凡百都求節省費用的當兒，獨有迎神賽會，却例外地熱鬧。</p>
<p>吾人明瞭產生迎神賽會的病源以後，可知純用强迫禁止無益，必須用以下根本治絕辦法：</p>
<p>（一）提高農民文化，使知神佛的神秘魔力，際此科學昌明時代，早已失却存在的價値。</p>
<p>（二）創辦農村娛樂塲，農村圖書館，農村茶園等正當消遣地，</p>
<p>（三）拆毁不正當的廟宇，改建農村娛樂塲等公益塲所，使農民失却迷信的憑籍，知神秘魔力之不可靠。以上三項方法，實爲治療迎神賽會的根本良方。如能依法實行，不但可使迎神賽會的風氣絕跡，而且亦是農村建設的必經步驟。尙望社會　達，共襄這個盛舉。</p>

<h3>Joint Meeting of the Central Standing Committee and the National Defense Council Decides on Four Major Policies for the Present; Executive Yuan to Draft Implementation Measures</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 6th] Following the first enlarged memorial service held this week at the National Government Auditorium on the morning of the 6th at 9:00 AM, the first joint meeting of the Central Standing Committee and the Supreme National Defense Council since the return to the capital was held at the Chairman's Office Building. Attendees included Ju Zheng, Sun Ke, Song Ziwen, He Yingqin, Li Wenfan, Wu Jingheng, Chen Cheng, Wu Tiecheng, Zhu Jiahua, Shao Lizi, Zhang Lisheng, Weng Wenhao, Wang Shijie, Wu Dingchang, Jiang Menglin, Chen Qingyun, Lin Yunhai, Chen Qicai, Cheng Tianfang, Liu Wendao, Li Jingzhai, Zhu Qing, Yu Hongjun, Gu Zhenggang, Xu Kan, Chen Lifu, Wu Guozhen, Pan Gongzhan, Duan Xipeng, Liu Jianqun, Zhang Daofan, Li Zonghuang, Xiao Tongzi, Liu Keshu, Liu Hengjing, Deng Wenyi, Tian Kunshan, He Zhonghan, Wang Qijiang, Liu Weizhi, Xiao Zheng, Lai Lian, He Yaozu, Liang Hancao, Bai Yunti, and 45 others. President Chiang personally chaired the meeting, which lasted until 12:35 PM. It is reported that attendees engaged in extensive discussions regarding military, political, and economic affairs since the return to the capital, and decided on four major policies: (1) Stabilize prices by increasing production, restoring transportation, curbing speculation, and stabilizing the financial sector through concrete and effective measures. (2) Although the compensation for civil servants has been repeatedly increased, it remains insufficient to meet basic needs due to the continuous rise in prices; therefore, adjustments should be made immediately. (3) Government expenditures due to repatriation, military reorganization, return to the capital, restoration of transportation, and adjustments to the compensation of officers, soldiers, and civil servants should be streamlined and reduced as quickly as possible. (4) The allocation of buildings for government agencies in the capital should be fair and appropriate. It is reported that the Executive Yuan will draft concrete measures for the above four matters to be implemented separately.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 6th] The Executive Yuan is scheduled to hold its first formal meeting since the return to the capital at 10:00 AM on the 7th. It is reported that based on the instructions of the joint meeting of the Supreme National Defense Council and the Central Standing Committee, the compensation for civil servants will be increased by 50% to 100% of their current monthly salaries, if possible. Due to soaring prices, the current monthly salary of 140,000 yuan for the mayor of Nanjing is even less than the income of a rickshaw puller. The suffering of low-level civil servants can be imagined. Given the current prices in Nanjing, even doubling the salary would not be excessive.</p>
<h3>First Memorial Week Since Return to the Capital; Chairman Leads Ceremony and Delivers Admonitory Speech, Urging Active Promotion of Party, Government, and Military Work</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 6th] The first central memorial week since the return of the National Government to the capital was held at the National Government Auditorium at 9:00 AM on the morning of the 6th. Chairman Chiang personally presided over the ceremony, which was attended by Central Committee members, heads of various Yuan, ministries, and commissions, and party and government personnel including Wu Jingheng, Ju Zheng, Song Ziwen, Sun Ke, Wu Tiecheng, Weng Wenhao, He Yingqin, Chen Lifu, Wang Shijie, Shao Lizi, Wu Dingchang, Chen Cheng, Zhu Jiahua, Zhang Lisheng, Xie Guansheng, Pan Gongzhan, Zhang Daofan, Wu Guozhen, Xiao Tongzi, Gan Naikang, and Di Ying, totaling over 300 people. After leading the ceremony, Chairman Chiang delivered an admonitory speech, stating that since the return to the capital, all matters should be actively carried out according to the central government's predetermined plans. Special efforts should be made in the economic, political, and military fields. The work of the Supreme Economic Council should be expedited and advanced within ten days or two weeks. In the political field, the convening of the National Assembly, which was originally agreed upon by the Political Consultative Conference, should now actively overcome difficulties and seek solutions. In the military field, the first phase of the reorganization plan was completed at the end of last month, but active replenishment and training must be carried out thereafter. He hoped that those responsible for the above three points would continue to implement them according to the plan. The Chairman continued, stating that due to the return to the capital, many resolutions of the Second Plenary Session of the Central Committee have not yet been implemented. Now that all agencies have returned to the capital, he hopes that the comrades responsible for the party affairs and the members of the Central Standing Committee should immediately review the resolutions and plans and implement them as soon as possible. The development of party affairs is related to the success or failure of our revolution. He earnestly hopes that all comrades will make redoubled efforts to shoulder the mission of national construction. After the speech, the Chairman led the entire assembly in reciting the Party Member Code of Conduct, and the ceremony concluded at 9:20 AM.</p>

<h3>Memorial to Dr. Sun Yat-sen Unveiled in London</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 6th] A memorial to Dr. Sun Yat-sen, located at his former residence in London, was unveiled yesterday by the acting chargé d'affaires of the Chinese Embassy. The ceremony was presided over by Lord Ervin, chairman of the China Association, who read memorial messages from Chairman Chiang, Prime Minister Attlee, and President Sun Ke. Dr. Sun's former residence was on Crayes Inn Street in London. The building was destroyed during the bombing. Plans are underway to build a new house on the site.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 6th] At the unveiling of the Sun Yat-sen Memorial here yesterday, the acting chargé d'affaires of the Chinese Embassy delivered a speech, stating that this memorial ceremony is sufficient to show the close relationship between the two great nations of China and the United Kingdom, and to ensure that the long-standing relationship between the two countries is never forgotten. Attendees at yesterday's unveiling ceremony included Lord Ervin, chairman of the China Association, who had previously traveled to China in 1942 with a delegation of parliamentarians, Secretary of State for War Lawson, Mrs. Wellington Koo, representatives of the High Commissioners of Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, and Canada, the Archbishops of Westminster and Canterbury, and former British Consul-General in Shanghai, Sir Pratt and his wife.

<h3>Military Mediation Department's Military Reorganization Office to be Established Soon</h3>
<p>All Three Chiefs Have Arrived in Beiping</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Office, 6th] Dong Jiarui, the government's chief of the Military Reorganization Office of the Military Mediation Department, and the two major generals, Zeng Guanghan, the deputy chief, and Chen Shiqu, the chief of the CCP's Military Reorganization Office, arrived in Beiping separately from Chongqing. The office will be formally established soon. The American side has already started working, and the chief is Colonel Mi Biaotun. The three parties also discussed this matter at the chief of staff meeting on the 6th. The CCP side also conducted separate discussions. Chen Shiqu will fly to Yan'an again within days to contact the CCP Central Committee and submit a list of military reorganizations to the Military Mediation Department. However, before serious problems such as those in the Northeast are resolved, the so-called military reorganization will not go beyond formalistic perfunctoriness.</p>
<h3>Government and CCP Exchange Materials and Food in Hebei</h3>
<p>Wenxi and Quwo Are Planning to Lift the Siege</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Office, 6th] Xinhua News Agency stated that the government exchanged materials for food with the CCP. The CCP has delivered more than 7.1 million catties of wheat and 600,000 catties of millet to the Hebei Provincial Grain Office at the Xinle Station on the Pinghan Railway and the Yangliuqing Station on the Jinpu Railway.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Jinan, 5th] The Jinan Group Materials Procurement Committee held its second group meeting at 2:00 PM on the afternoon of the 5th. Government representatives Zhang Hongying, Tian Xiangqian, Peng Fuchang, and Mu Daozheng, and CCP representatives Xu Yimin, Xie Huishan, Liu Yucai, and Zhang Yiwen attended. The following resolutions were made: (1) Both parties shall issue a list of required materials, which will be handled by the branch staff. (2) The import of wheat and coal shall be handled by the CCP, who shall immediately dispatch personnel to Taian Mingshan to procure them.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 5th] Representatives of the three parties of the Military Mediation Department's Houma Group left Taiyuan for Linfen on the morning of the 5th. The group came to Taiyuan this time and held meetings with the Taiyuan Central Group for several consecutive days, discussing the mediation methods and various practical issues in detail. They believed that after returning to Linfen, they would seek to resolve the most difficult problems of Wenxi, Quwo, and Jiangxian's lifting of the siege and the transportation of food as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Liaoning Chairman Xu Zhen Inspects Counties in Western Liaoning</h3>
<p>Shenyang Reporters Go to Benxi With Reserve</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 6th] The National Army entered Benxi on the 3rd, and the Communist Army collapsed. More than a dozen reporters from local newspapers and foreign reporters stationed in Shenyang departed by car on the 6th to inspect the area. In addition, Xu Zhen, chairman of Liaoning Province, scheduled to lead personnel from the civil affairs, finance, construction, and education departments to travel west along the Beining Road from Shenyang Station on the 6th to inspect spring plowing, highways, civil administration, finance, construction, education, and other general administration in various counties in western Liaoning, and return to Shenyang in five days.</p>
<h3>Five U.S. Reporters Departing from Changchun Will Temporarily Stay in Shenyang</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 6th] The American plane going to Changchun to pick up the trapped five U.S. reporters has been dispatched today. It is reported that after they leave Changchun, they will not return to Beiping temporarily, but will stay in Shenyang.</p>
<h3>Central Propaganda Department Hosts Press; Wu Guozhen Reports on Disaster Relief Efforts; Pan Gongzhan Calls for Elimination of Traitorous Fallacies</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 6th] The Central Propaganda Department held its first press conference since returning to the capital at 4:00 PM on the afternoon of the 6th. Minister Wu Guozhen personally presided over the conference, which was attended by Central Committee member Pan Gongzhan, Central News Agency President Xiao Tongzi, heads of various newspapers in Nanjing, and over 100 Chinese and foreign reporters. Minister Wu first explained in extremely humble terms that the Central Propaganda Department would assist in the development of the Chinese news industry with the utmost sincerity. He also reported on the efforts of the Central Propaganda Department to purchase paper from Switzerland, Canada, and Japan to alleviate the domestic paper shortage. He then expressed his satisfaction that the newspaper industry in Nanjing had not yet engaged in speculative behavior, such as the small, 12-page magazines with yellow sensationalism and catering to lewdness and theft in Shanghai, and was greeted with applause from the audience. After Minister Wu finished his speech, Central Committee member Pan Gongzhan was invited to stand up and offer two points of opinion: (1) At the peak, there were as many as 50 small newspapers and magazines published in Shanghai after the victory. Although some of them had pure intentions and strived for the upper class, the style of most of them was, as Minister Wu said, invariably teaching lewdness and theft. The Central Propaganda Department should consider correcting this to save the trend. (2) It is heard that the traitors tried in the Soviet Union have all submitted uniform confessions. This type of traitorous theory has been published in newspapers and spread in neighborhoods. Among them, most try to minimize their guilt or pick up half-understood ideas to criticize current affairs. Judging by their intentions, they are simply trying to win public sympathy to cover up their crimes. This does not seem to be a phenomenon that should exist in the restored areas that were anesthetized by the enemy puppets for eight years. General opinion suggests that the government should consider correcting this to clear out the toxins. After Pan finished speaking, the Chinese and foreign reporters in attendance applauded enthusiastically.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 6th] Minister of Propaganda Wu Guozhen, Vice Ministers Xu Xiaoyan, and Li Weiguo hosted a tea party for the press at the Public Recreation Society at 4:30 PM on the afternoon of the 6th. Over 80 Chinese and foreign reporters attended. This was the first gathering between the Central Propaganda Department and the press of the capital since the return to the capital. Minister Wu delivered a speech, saying that freedom of the press is the government's tentative policy, and the Central Propaganda Department will do its best to serve the press in the future, providing the genuine factual materials necessary for the press. News reporters should base their reporting on facts. Although multi-party politics in democratic countries have various different opinions, they must be based on facts and not distort right and wrong. Only then can good civic morals be fostered in society. Wu also said that freedom of the press in our country is still in its infancy, and the press still needs to make active efforts. He hoped that the press in the capital would report more on public welfare and construction, and strictly prevent news that teaches lewdness and theft. Subsequently, Pan Gongzhan spoke, applying for the urgent correction of yellow sensationalism, and the deep toxicity of traitorous confession should be considered for publication. Xiao Tongzi put forward three hopes: (1) The Executive Yuan should strengthen contact with the press and provide reporting materials. (2) The government should strengthen telecommunications and facilitate news transmission. (3) Newspapers are too expensive, and the government should find a way to subscribe to them on behalf of the press. Gong Debai also hoped that government agency newspapers would promote price reductions. Ma Xingye believed that the Central Propaganda Department's news policy was a landmark policy, and he expressed his support on behalf of the Capital Reporters Association. Mao Jianwu hoped that the Central Propaganda Department would regularly have responsible personnel to contact the press and suggested that the Ministry of Communications be requested to improve telecommunications. Finally, Cao Tianzong, the Nanjing reporter for the News, reported on the brutal situation of the Communist Army in northern Jiangsu. The meeting adjourned at 6:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Sino-U.S. Talks on Treaty of Friendship and Commerce; $60 Million Credit Loan Agreed; Britain to Build Factories in China to Manufacture Jet Propulsion Engines</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 5th] American commerce in China is gradually showing signs of revival, and is developing in new directions. Although still affected by Chinese restrictions and currency inflation, in the minds of most people, the future of trade with China is extremely promising. They were initially full of hope that China would establish a strong democratic government due to the initial success of Marshall's mission to China. Now, they are further encouraged by the Chinese government's official guarantee that the Chinese Company Law will not hinder foreign investment. The State Department is currently negotiating a treaty of friendship and commerce with China, and has also requested that China provide better conditions for American commerce. At the same time, diplomats hope that China will make significant concessions. The Export-Import Bank of the United States will also be involved in private enterprises and become a major shareholder in trade with China. The bank will soon extend a credit loan of $500 million to China, of which $60 million has already been approved.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 4th] The Chinese government and Rolls-Royce, one of the largest manufacturing companies in the United Kingdom, have recently signed a contract to manufacture gas turbine and jet propulsion aircraft engines in China. The company announced today that this contract with the Chinese government includes the supply of thousands of drawings and designs to China, as well as the supply of many parts and complete machines, as well as machine equipment for Chinese factories. Several British engineers will travel to China to supervise the construction and assembly of the factory for the future manufacture of Rolls-Royce jet engines. Many Chinese engineers are currently training at the Rolls-Royce factory in Derby, England.</p>
<p>Military and Political Department Establishes Submarine Training Class</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 6th] The Nanjing branch of the Naval Department of the Military and Political Department has established a submarine training class. Minister of Military and Political Affairs General Chen Cheng encouraged the sailors to study hard and promote the submarine service as one of the most important parts of the military. The training class is the first of its kind in China. After one month of initial training, the trainees will be sent to the United Kingdom for further study. The selection of trainees is being undertaken by two captains, Bai and Xiong, who recently returned from the United Kingdom.</p>
<h3>Xu, Zhou, and Others Inspect Central Hubei; Members of the Military Mediation Department and Chiefs of Staff Convene to Order All Groups to Strictly Enforce Orders</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 6th] The key to the overall situation still lies in whether the Communist Army is willing for us to withdraw from Changchun. The government is trying its best to seek true peace with the greatest tolerance and determination. According to information obtained by our reporter, the anxious mood of the Communist Army in the eastern section of the Longhai Railway, the northern section of the Pinghan Railway, and various places in southern Henan and northern Anhui has not yet calmed down. Due to the military's strengthening of the river defenses and increasing defensive strength in northern Jiangsu, the situation can be seen to be easing.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 6th] It is heard that after Xu Yongchang, Zhou Enlai, and General Gillem went to Wuhan to investigate the so-called conflict in central Hubei, no report has yet been received in Nanjing. According to those close to Special Envoy Marshall: Marshal did not receive a report until the 6th. It is also said that the CCP is not very clear about the actual situation in central Hubei. Relevant parties here expect that the three-person committee of Xu, Zhou, and Gillem will have a detailed report coming on the 7th.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 6th] Brigadier General Gillem, General Xu Yongchang, and General Zhou Enlai traveled to Xuanhua Store upstream of Hankou on the 6th to inspect the front lines in central Hubei where civil war occurred. According to Central News Agency: This highest-level ceasefire enforcement group held long talks yesterday and this morning, but no decision was reached.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Office, 6th] The three members of the Military Mediation Department and the chiefs of staff have been working very intensely in the past few days. However, these meetings, in addition to increasing difficulties for each other, provide little benefit. As a result of the various difficulties, the transportation problem is very difficult to solve. The continued destruction of transportation or minor conflicts on the various lines no longer seem to be valued. It is heard that the chiefs of staff meeting on the 6th decided to reaffirm the previous order and ordered all enforcement groups to strictly enforce Ceasefire Order No. 6. A certain authority told reporters that they were worried that the failure of the Council of Foreign Ministers might affect the solution of our domestic problems.</p>
<h3>First Batch of Japanese Prisoners of War in Northeast China Begin Repatriation</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Beiping, 6th] The previous claim that Japanese prisoners of war in Northeast China were being sent to Siberia has been denied by Shenyang officials today. It is said that the first batch of 6,000 Japanese people sailed from Qinhuangdao to Huludao on May 1 for repatriation to their home country. Another 1,000 are technicians, who will remain in Qinhuangdao for use in mining and factories. The remaining 62,000 will be withdrawn from western Liaoning and eastern Jehol within 20 days.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 6th] When the Japanese army surrendered, there were a total of 61,167 Japanese prisoners of war in the Shanxi area. After verifying 161 war criminals and relevant witnesses to war crimes, they were sent in 87 batches in stages. The last batch was sent yesterday, and the Japanese Disarmed Officers and Soldiers Management Office was ordered to be abolished today.</p>
<h3>Communist Army Crosses the Sea to Expand into Northeast China; Jinan Botou Town Station Attacked</h3>
<p>[United Press, Beiping, 6th] According to the Xinsheng Daily: In just two days, May 3 and 4, more than 50,000 Communist troops have crossed the Bohai Strait from the Shandong Peninsula to the Dalian area by sailing ships, reaching the tip of southern Manchuria. The newspaper also said: The Communist troops crossing the strait carried a large amount of food, weapons, and ammunition to reinforce the Communist army positions in southern Northeast China. Transportation authorities told the press today that the entire Pingfan Railway line has been repaired and is now ready to resume two-way traffic.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Panjin, 6th] According to information from the transportation sector, all trains south of Shenyang on the China-Chang Railway can now reach Dashiqiao today. The railway from Dashiqiao to Yingkou has also been opened to traffic. It now takes one day and night to reach Yingkou from Jinan.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Nanjing, 6th] The Huabao reported that 30,000 Communist troops have gathered near Gongzhuling to resist the National Army's advance towards Changchun. There are now 70 Communist aircraft gathered in Tongliao, including some U.S.-made P-47s. There are currently 260,000 Communist troops in Shandong Province, most of whom have crossed the sea and infiltrated into Northeast China. According to the Jiuguo Daily: The Communist army is adopting a defensive posture in the Northeast and an offensive posture inside the pass to prevent the National Army from heading to the Northeast. There are now 15 Communist brigades concentrated in Yutian in eastern Hebei Province, plotting to attack the Beining Railway. The Communist army in northern Hebei is consolidating its positions to prevent the National Army from advancing north along the Pinghan Railway.</p>
<p>[United Press, Beiping, 6th] According to government sources here: More than 1,000 Communist troops attacked the Botou Town Station, about 80 miles south of Tianjin, on the morning of the 6th. The National Army defending the area was forced to retreat. After a counterattack, they regained their original position. The battle is still ongoing. At the same time, the Communist army is building strong defense lines along the north bank of the Zhang River to prevent the National Army from advancing north along the Pinghan Railway. According to government sources here: In the past few months, 20 Communist regiments, totaling more than 100,000 people, have successively traveled from the borders of Shaanxi, Hebei, and Henan to Northeast China.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 5th] Bridge No. 74 between Tangguantun Station and Machang Station on the northern section of the Jinpu Railway was destroyed by the Communist army on the night of the 4th. Eight sections of track were destroyed. The Communist army also planted eight landmines between Machang Station and Qingxian Station. Three of them have exploded, destroying twelve sections of track. The other three have been removed. The Bureau has dispatched repair vehicles to carry out repairs. After a full day of repairs on the 5th, the repairs were completed and the line was opened to traffic at 4:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Suzhou High Court Retries Wu Yuan Di, a Traitorous Element</h3>
<p>[Our Suzhou Office, 6th] Wu Yuan Di, the manager of the puppet Central Reserve Bank's Suzhou branch, was previously sentenced to eight years of imprisonment by the High Court on February 16. The traitor appealed against the sentence and applied for a retrial to the Supreme Court, which ruled to send it back for retrial. The Suzhou High Court held a public trial at around 3:00 PM on the afternoon of the 6th. Because it was necessary for Chen Gongbo to testify in court regarding the motives for issuing the puppet Central Reserve Bank notes, the High Court, for the sake of prudence, specially dispatched the presiding judge of the case, Liu Shichou, to the detention center at around 2:00 PM to interrogate Chen in the nearby location. According to his testimony, the issuance of the puppet currency was to stop the circulation of Japanese military currency and to suppress and stabilize prices. As for the direct responsibility, he completely shifted the blame to Zhou Fohai. The interrogation lasted about 30 minutes. Judge Liu returned to the court, ascended the bench in the second court, and brought Wu to the court for trial. His testimony was strongly defended. After about an hour, the court adjourned and he was sent back into custody.</p>
<h3>Customs to Revise Tariff Rules: Six Principles to Strengthen Protective Tariffs</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Office, 6th] According to customs news, in order to coordinate with the domestic and international economic situation and domestic construction plans, the financial authorities are likely to revise import and export tariffs. There are six principles: (1) Important materials that are lacking domestically, difficult to produce locally, or subject to production restrictions should be exempted from tariffs. (2) Equipment and materials related to national defense or economic construction, for which domestic production is insufficient, should be subject to low tariffs.

<h3>Shao Lizi Officially Announces National Congress to Be Held After Autumn Coolness, Chairman Jiang Receives Representatives in Nanjing Today</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 6th] Shao Lizi, chairman of the National Congress Preparatory Committee, received representatives of the National Congress in Nanjing at the political school auditorium at 3 p.m. on the 6th, with 264 people attending. Chairman Shao reported, first stating the government's difficulties in postponing the National Congress, and then explaining the powers of the Preparatory Committee. After Shao finished speaking, more than ten representatives, including He Bingru, Dai Tianqiu, Chen Zifeng, Chen Guojun, Li Zhenya, and Wang Shuhui, successively stood up to accuse the government of not being accommodating to a few selfish and self-interested factions and postponing the National Congress, which seriously violated public opinion, and their words were extremely poignant. Xiang Yujie, a representative from Hunan, was so angry that he returned the charter. Finally, Shao, chairman of the committee, repeatedly explained and comforted them. After the meeting, it was heard that Chairman Jiang had scheduled a tea party at the Lizhi Society at 4 p.m. tomorrow to receive the representatives, at which time the representatives would directly express their opinions to the chairman.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 6th] "The National Congress will be postponed until after the autumn coolness."

Shao also stated that the Preparatory Committee has decided to continue to receive representatives in Nanjing for ten days from today and assist the representatives in solving transportation problems within these ten days, so that they can temporarily return to their hometowns. The same approach will be taken for the representatives who are currently on their way to Nanjing.

Finally, he said that the letters and opinions that the representatives entrusted him to forward to Chairman Jiang have been forwarded separately.

<h3>A Grand Occasion: "The May Fifth Tea Party"</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent for Shen Bao in Nanjing, Zhao Haosheng</p>
<p>The "May Fifth Tea Party" held at the National Government Auditorium at 4:30 p.m. on May 5 was one of the most lively events of the grand celebration of the return to the capital. Ambassadors from various countries, ministers, members of the Central Committee, senators, etc., all received an invitation jointly signed by the chairman and his wife. Inside the gate of the National Government, a row of honor guards stood, saluting each guest who arrived. After signing their names on the signature platforms on the left and right, each person was given a large red circular guest pass with "May Fifth Tea Party" printed on it. Especially the ambassadors and their wives from various countries, when the receptionist hung the guest pass on their lapels, it was like hanging smiles on them—they were smiling for China's victory, because in this long war of resistance against aggression, they fought side by side with the Chinese people. Today, after the overall victory, they should come to share the joy of China's victory.</p>
<p>Chief of Staff He and his wife arrived very early. In front of the signature platform, the reporter asked him to inscribe the four characters "Victorious Return to the Capital" on a card as a souvenir. Soviet Ambassador Petrov, wearing a navy blue serge suit and light brown striped pants, arrived with his elegantly dressed wife, smiling. Ten minutes before the tea party began, in the large hall with towering vermilion pillars, Marshal Marshall, who was tall and strong, also arrived suddenly. He cordially walked and talked with his wife in the hall. He was extremely interested in the magnificent architecture of the National Government. Marshal Ma understood China, and he knew that the vermilion pillars were a symbol of solemnity, loftiness, and authority. He was explaining to his wife in a low voice, looking up at the painted roof, with a moving smile on his face. He was still wearing a serge American military uniform that day, with the shoulder straps of a five-star marshal in white. The marshal's clothing was no different from what the reporter saw in Chongqing four months ago, but his chest seemed straighter and his face seemed rosier. Marshal Ma maintains his health through constant work. Marshal Ma's wife is an unusually quiet lady with a kind face. She wore a light brown silk low-cut suit, fastened with a belt with gold buttons, and a delicate hat adorned with a pink and a light blue camellia. Walking through the second door, she took off her fur shawl and white gloves together and draped them over her arm. Her body was as strong as Marshal Ma's, but not as slender as Marshal Ma's. This pair of equally kind and healthy elderly couple is a beautiful picture of life. These smiling and side-by-side guests became the most watched figures. In front of the signature platform, Marshal Ma's wife first lightly wrote a line of beautiful words on the exquisite and huge signature book. Marshal Ma more solemnly wrote his signature beginning with a large S. When the receptionist put the small guest pass on their lapels, Marshal Ma and his wife looked at each other and smiled, constantly saying, "Thank you."</p>
<p>There were military attachés in full dress, gentlemen in tailcoats, and the ladies were all dressed up. Although their clothes were different, their faces were filled with the same joy. The distinguished guests walked to the lounge or shook hands and talked in the corridor. The National Government was filled with joy.</p>
<p>When the reporter attended the meeting, he brought a Shen Bao. In the corridor, he met Mr. Shao Lizi, a senior figure in the press. He first borrowed the newspaper brought by the reporter, took off his glasses, and stood in the corridor to read it. Then, an office worker from the Chairman's Office who was familiar with the reporter came over and said that the Chairman now wanted to read Shanghai newspapers, but he didn't know if the newspapers had arrived yet. At that time, it was past 4 o'clock, and the newspapers had arrived in Nanjing, but they probably hadn't been delivered because it was difficult to pass through the roads of the National Government. The reporter gave the Shen Bao that Mr. Shao was reading to him to forward to the Chairman. This was the first Shanghai newspaper that the Chairman saw on the day of the return to the capital.</p>
<p>At 4:30 p.m., the Chairman and his wife came out from inside, still wearing the clothes they wore when they paid respects at the mausoleum in the morning, except that the Chairman was not wearing a hat. The guests in the corridor separated to both sides and stood at attention to pay their respects. The Chairman nodded and smiled, repeatedly saying "Good! Good!", and greeted the guests on both sides to walk forward. The madam smiled and nodded to everyone.</p>
<p>The military music sounded, and the guests followed the Chairman and his wife into the venue. In the square hall, four long tables were set up, and various famous and expensive snacks were piled high in large plates. The tea party was held in the form of a cocktail party. The guests moved freely and ate refreshments. The military band played the most cheerful music, and waiters served lemonade. Inside the hall, Chinese and foreign civil and military officials gathered, and the fragrance of the ladies' clothes and shadows filled the air. The huge hall could not contain this overwhelming joy.</p>
<p>Chairman Jiang stood in the middle of a row of long tables, constantly greeting the guests to eat refreshments. To the left of the Chairman was Ambassador Petrov, and to the right was President Song and Foreign Minister Wang. Under the glass windows on the right side of the hall, there was an even more touching scene. The Chairman's wife and Marshal Ma's wife sat around a round table. Marshal Ma was in a very relaxed posture, holding the backs of the two ladies' sofas with both hands, talking and laughing. The laughter in this corner was loud and continuous, forming the highest note in the great chorus of joy.</p>
<p>The staff of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs introduced the military attachés, counselors, and their wives from various countries to the Chairman one by one, and shook hands, bowed, and congratulated him. Finally, the Chairman walked to the round table where the Chairman's wife and Marshal Ma's couple were. Marshal Ma and his wife once again shook hands with the Chairman to congratulate him. The Chairman and his wife, in their capacity as hosts, asked the guests to enjoy more refreshments.</p>
<p>The reporter asked the officials to sign their names on their business cards in the crowd. When he approached the Chairman's wife and explained his intention, the madam smiled and nodded in agreement. She put down the teacup in her hand and happily wrote the four characters "Victorious Return to the Capital" on the armrest of the sofa with a pen. Readers can see the Chairman's wife's happy mood in this light stroke.</p>
<p>At 5:30 p.m., the Chairman and his wife said goodbye to everyone and walked out of the hall. The tea party was still in progress. In this extremely joyful mood, people would forget the time.</p>
<p>The party ended happily after six o'clock. The military music played a reluctant farewell tune, and the setting sun plated a layer of bright red on the faces of each guest, which were full of joy. (Late night on the 5th in Nanjing)</p>
<h3>Chiang Ching-kuo Arrives in Nanjing</h3>
<p>Shen Honglie Scheduled to Return to Zhejiang on the 9th</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 6th] Chiang Ching-kuo arrived in Nanjing by plane from Chongqing at 2:30 p.m. on the 6th. The chairman of Zhejiang, Shen Honglie, is scheduled to return to Zhejiang from Nanjing on the 9th.</p>
<h3>Marshal Eisenhower to Fly from the Philippines to Nanjing Tomorrow or the Day After Tomorrow, to Visit Chairman Chiang and Confer with Marshal Marshall</h3>
<p>[Our Report] According to reliable sources: U.S. Army Chief of Staff Marshal Eisenhower has recently inspected military facilities in the Manila area of the Philippines and discussed the construction of air bases with the Philippine government. He will fly directly to Nanjing from Manila tomorrow or the day after tomorrow to visit Chairman Chiang and meet with Marshal Marshall. He will stay for about three hours and then transfer to Korea and Tokyo. The trip to Shanghai has been canceled. U.S. Army Commander in China Lieutenant General Gillem will make a special trip to Nanjing to welcome him.</p>
<p>[U.S. News Agency, Washington, 6th] On the anniversary of the victory in Europe, Army Chief of Staff Eisenhower issued a statement saying: "The first anniversary of the victory in Europe will inspire the Army to reaffirm their confidence in the solemnity and freedom of mankind. So many people have fought and lost their lives for these freedoms, which should remind us that nations cannot say that they have fulfilled their responsibilities to those who fought for their victory until permanent and universal peace has been established. When the guns of Europe fell silent, the need for continuous and consistent effort and personal sacrifice did not cease. The fighters of the United Nations have given us a second chance in thirty years, or perhaps our last chance, to eliminate the inhumanity of terror in the world. In fact, the world can no longer tolerate another war. Those who wear the Army uniform are committed to the priceless reality of security for our country, and they are excited by the prospect that the increasing mutual trust between nations will one day make the work of combat personnel a thing of the past."</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Prospects for Domestic Politics After the Return to the Capital</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the government returned to the capital. Chairman Chiang, leading civil and military officials and representatives of the people, paid their respects to the late Premier Sun Yat-sen. This is a grand occasion that the Chinese people have been praying for day and night for the past eight years. At this historic moment, at the celebration meeting of all sectors of the capital, Chairman Chiang delivered a speech to the soldiers and civilians of the whole country. This is a historical document for this historical occasion. Although the words are concise, the meaning is extremely profound. This is Chairman Chiang's first announcement to the soldiers and civilians of the country after his triumphant return to the capital. In this speech, Chairman Chiang announced to us: "...We should learn from the pain, never forget the enslavement, the servitude, and the dark and hopeless lives we have suffered under the enemy's iron hooves for the past eight years. We must be vigilant and strive for self-reliance and self-strengthening. In particular, the national humiliation of the September 18th Incident fifteen years ago, when Shenyang in the Northeast was captured, should be deeply remembered as a permanent historical lesson for our Chinese nation for generations to come. Fellow countrymen, the government's return to the capital today only signifies the end of our war of resistance against Japan. It is the victory we achieved through the National Government's policy of resisting to the end and leading all soldiers and civilians to sacrifice and struggle. However, although we have recovered Shenyang today, the integrity of the entire administration and sovereignty of the Northeast still requires the sincere cooperation and continued efforts of all our compatriots for the country and the nation to maintain the glorious fruits of our final victory. Only in this way can we comfort the spirits in heaven of the soldiers and civilians who sacrificed for the War of Resistance and the revolution over the past eight years..." Indeed, the government's return to the capital only signifies the end of our war of resistance against Japan. We must continue to work hard to ensure the glorious fruits of our final victory—the integrity of the entire administration and sovereignty of the Northeast. Chairman Chiang's special emphasis on this point at the historical occasion of the return to the capital has a profound meaning, which needs no further explanation.</p>
<p>Currently, in China, we see the government's triumphant return to the capital, but on the other hand, we see the Communist Party's troops instigating wars everywhere, attacking the National Army. The capture of Changchun and the unfolding of the war in the Northeast clearly demonstrate the Communist Party's attempt to undermine the National Army's takeover of the Northeast. Similar combat actions have recently spread from North China to northern Jiangsu, with the aim of weakening the National Army and expanding the Communist Army's defense zone. All these combat actions are initiated by the Communist Party. The National Army has no choice but to defend itself under the principle of self-defense. However, the Communist Party propagandizes that their offensives are defensive and are for internal war. Such propaganda is originally confined to the wise. With such an open fact placed before the Chinese people, and with objective reports from impartial third parties, even those with limited wisdom will be able to distinguish between right and wrong. This kind of distortion of facts by the Communist Party, undermining national unity and instigating war, is not worthy of being called "internal war." From the perspective of the state, the Communist Party's military actions are a rebellion, not an "internal war." This is an illegal, unrestrained, and reckless act of treason that disregards the interests of the nation. In principle, it should be suppressed and punished. However, the government, based on the principle of peace and unity, has not launched a punitive expedition. This is the government's painstaking effort to show consideration for the people's suffering after the war and to make concessions for peace. The people need peace, and the government also needs peace. The only one who does not want peace is the Communist Party. Moreover, people from all walks of life are calling for peace. Some people in Shanghai have even organized a so-called "Shanghai People's Organizations Federation" to call for peace. We must especially point out that the government needs peace as much as the people do, but it is the Communist Party that is undermining peace. If we want peace, we must first stop the Communist Party's actions and attempts to undermine peace. We cannot reverse the facts and distort the truth. If we do not analyze the situation and call for peace in a general way, the result will only be to condone the Communist Party's harm to the country and the people. The more we call for peace, the less we can ensure peace.</p>
<p>We must also point out that the development of the situation in the Northeast to the present stage, namely the failure to restore the integrity of the entire administration and sovereignty of the Northeast, is clearly due to the Communist Party's sabotage. According to the Sino-Soviet Treaty, the entire Northeast should have been taken over by the National Government. Before the National Army arrived, the Communist Army rushed to the Northeast to obstruct the National Army's takeover, occupy cities, and engage in illegal activities. All of this has been objectively reported by impartial third parties. Unless one has ulterior motives and is willing to be a traitor to the country, one will have a clear understanding of the development of the situation in the Northeast. Sovereignty is indivisible, and territory is indivisible. The Northeast is China's Northeast, the Northeast of the Chinese people. The Chinese people's only wish for the past fifteen years has been the recovery of the Northeast, and the recovery of the Northeast is the responsibility of the National Government. Therefore, we cannot have any specializations under any pretext. The entire Northeast must be taken over by the National Government. To take into account the objective facts, the proposal made by Special Envoy Marshall that the Communist Army immediately withdraw from Changchun and then discuss other matters is already a concession in nature, because the entire Northeast should have been recovered by the National Government and there should not have been any problems. Requiring the Communist Party to withdraw from Changchun before discussing other matters is already a major concession, a concession that should not have been made in law. However, in order to take into account all objective facts and to appreciate Special Envoy Marshall's good intentions, if we accept this proposal, we should not make any further concessions. The Communist Party's so-called "unconditional ceasefire" is a guarantee to protect the territory they have occupied and to prevent the central government from taking over, which is equivalent to a robber shouting to the police after stealing something and forbidding them from shooting and arresting the thief. There is no reason to accept it at all. As for the so-called "the Northeast issue should be decided by a vote of the people of the Northeast," that is even more absurd. The Northeast is China's Northeast and does not require a vote of the people of the Northeast. This is different from the situation of the "Alsace-Lorraine" provinces contested by France and Germany, and cannot be compared. Therefore, the statement "the Northeast issue should be decided by a vote of the people of the Northeast" is not something that Chinese people should say. This statement violates the national interests of China and is similar to the behavior of the fifth column selling out national interests.</p>
<p>In response to the current situation in China, the government is making concessions in order to seek peace, and the people are earnestly demanding peace. When we call for peace for the people, we can only earnestly demand that the Chinese Communist Party stop all disturbances inside and outside the Customs. The Communist Party's offensive has spread from the Northeast outside Shanhaiguan to Hebei, Shanxi, Shandong, and northern Jiangsu near Beijing and Shanghai. The people have suffered eight years of war. How can they bear the disaster of war again? Although there may be differences in political views and policies, we should strive for the sympathy of the people in an enlightened manner. We must never let the people who have suffered from the ravages of war suffer the calamity of war again. China is a whole. This is neither the China of the Kuomintang nor the China of the Communist Party, but the China of the Chinese people. Although political parties may have party disputes, we cannot deepen the suffering of the people. What is currently deepening the suffering of the Chinese people is the disruptive action of the CCP. For the sake of the people, we earnestly request the CCP to stop all disruptive actions.</p>
<p>For the sake of the Chinese people, we must also point out another fact. Since the open activities of political parties, many political parties have emerged. Among them, there are indeed political groups that are loyal to the country, but there are also useless politicians who only know how to compete for territory for their parties or even for themselves. Since the "Political Consultative Conference," there have been few political disputes over policies and principles, and more disputes over territory. This has created a very bad impression among the Chinese people. We want to ask which people the "political parties" that have emerged in recent times can represent and how many people's intentions they can represent. I am afraid that even the leaders of the various parties cannot answer this question. Most of the Chinese people are not affiliated with any party. China has so many followers of Islam, but there is no political party organized by the followers of Islam. There are over five million followers of Christianity, of which over four million are followers of Catholicism, but there is no political party organized by the followers of Christianity or a political party organized by the followers of Catholicism. It can be seen that the intentions of the majority of the Chinese people cannot be represented by these minority political parties. To respect the national public opinion, we must not overemphasize the private opinions of a few parties. We must seek the intentions of the people from other aspects. The public opinion that a few parties can represent may not be the full picture of public opinion. Now that the National Government has returned to the capital and is starting anew with the people, we must especially point out this point.</p>
<p>China needs stability, and the world needs stability. Whether the world can be stable and whether lasting peace can be ensured largely depends on the development of the situation in China. The "September 18th Incident" and the subsequent evolution of the situation in the Northeast triggered World War II. Now the whole world, including China, is coming out of this historical catastrophe. We should work harder to achieve stability and ensure peace. Now that the National Government has returned to the capital, all our people should uphold the good intentions in Chairman Chiang's speech, cooperate sincerely for the country and the nation, and continue to work hard to ensure the glorious fruits of our final victory. Looking forward to domestic politics after the return to the capital, we cannot but frankly state our intentions.</p>

<p>Suzhou</p>
<p>Increase the Purchase Price of Military Grain: Our county previously received an order from the province to raise 70,000 piculs of military grain. The original official price was 5,000 yuan per picul. By the end of last year, one-half had been handed over. Since the New Year, rice prices have soared, with market prices reaching more than 30,000 yuan, which is too different from the official military grain price, making it difficult to continue purchasing. The county government has repeatedly argued with the Provincial Grain Bureau, but to no avail. Recently, an order was received to adjust the price to 8,000 yuan in legal tender per picul, ordering the remaining grain to be delivered. However, the new official price is still very different from the current market price, and the county fears that the future of people's food will be greatly affected.</p>

In addition to the 7,638 piculs that have already been delivered, the missing grain amount will be allowed to increase the purchase price by 8,000 yuan per picul, plus the original 5,000 yuan, for a total of 13,000 yuan per picul. It is required to make up the full amount before May 10. After receiving the order, the county government was extremely anxious and decided to convene an emergency meeting of the County Council and the Rice and Grain Association on the 6th to discuss purchasing methods.</p>

<h3>Four Foreign Ministers Held Informal Meeting Yesterday, Still No Concrete Progress Achieved, Byrnes Firmly Opposed Soviet Proposals, The Success or Failure of the Meeting Depends on This Week</h3>
<p>[United Press Paris 6th] The Foreign Ministers' Conference reopened informally today. US Secretary of State Byrnes and Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov held private talks for a long time, but ultimately failed to achieve any concrete progress on the deadlock of the Italian issue. It is reported that Byrnes is determined to resist the Soviet side's efforts to make Trieste a city of the Southern countries and to gain a foothold in Tripolitania. During the weekend recess, Byrnes has prepared to oppose the Soviet side's actions in the Adriatic and the Mediterranean. There is now a general feeling between the British and American representatives that this week will be one of the most decisive weeks. Whether the foreign ministers can reach some kind of agreement or have to admit complete failure depends entirely on this week.</p>
<p>[Another telegram] In order to break the deadlock of the Foreign Ministers' Conference, US Secretary of State Byrnes has been holding informal talks with the foreign ministers in recent days. It is reported that the Italian issue and the disposition of Trieste still cannot be resolved in informal talks. It is generally believed that these informal talks are the last chance to resolve the difficulties.</p>
<p>[Associated Press Paris 6th] American sources here disclosed today: The United States may make concessions on the Balkan issue in exchange for Soviet concessions on the Italian issue, in order to break the deadlock of the four-nation Foreign Ministers' Conference in France. It is reported that Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov has suggested that if Trieste is assigned to Yugoslavia, the Soviet side will give considerable consideration to Italy's interests on the issue of Italian colonies and reparations. However, according to authoritative sources: US Secretary of State Byrnes and his advisors firmly believe that Italy should maintain Trieste and have decided not to give up an inch. It is said that although Molotov's proposal has been rejected, it is still the first indication that it may break the deadlock. The compromise point may involve the United States recognizing Bulgaria, and a part of Yueshuer and Niyia being assigned to Romania.</p>
<p>[United Press Paris 5th] The four major foreign ministers reached a final agreement last night on the issue of disposing of the Italian fleet and two small islands in the Adriatic Sea.</p>

<h3>China and Australia Oppose Soviet Proposals on Security Council Veto Issue</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency New York 5th Special Telegram] The committee of experts responsible for formulating the rules of procedure of the Security Council was originally most concerned about the veto issue. Now, because Australia and China oppose the Soviet proposal to expand the five major powers' veto plan, this issue has become even more difficult. The Soviet Union's new proposal on the veto is contained in the Soviet official document, and its content is: "Regarding the issues discussed by the Security Council, is it in the nature of procedure? If a problem belongs to the nature of dispute or situation, and whether this issue is involved in Article 33 of the United Nations Constitution?" The decision of these issues, if passed by a vote of seven members of the Security Council, including the permanent members of the Security Council, shall be deemed to be adopted. According to a United Nations observer's explanation, the Soviet proposal will make the use of the veto exceed the principles set by the Charter. Regarding this point, it is heard that my representative Liang Qunli strongly stated at the recent expert committee meeting that the Soviet proposal has far violated the guarantees made by the founding countries in San Francisco, that is, the use of the veto should be restrained and based on. The Soviet proposal will also make the Yalta veto provision meaningless. It is heard that only France has approved the Soviet Union's interpretation of the veto in principle. Britain and the United States have not yet expressed their opinions, but it is generally speculated that the two countries will follow the same attitude adopted in Yalta.</p>

<h3>One Year Since Germany's Surrender: The Tide of Socialism Sweeps Across Europe, Famine Is of Equal Importance</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 5th] It has been exactly one year since Germany's surrender. During this year, the tide of socialism has surged across Europe, from the British Isles in the west to the Black Sea in the east, and it is difficult to stop. Countless cities have been destroyed by artillery fire and are now striving to recover. Governments of various countries have a left-leaning tendency, which is rare since the 1840s revolutions. The German surrender treaty was signed at 2:41 AM on this day last year in Reims. The end of the European war caused King Peter of Yugoslavia and King Zog of Albania to lose their thrones. The UK also entered a new era of gradual socialism after the election, which can be called a "peaceful revolution." The so-called "protective zone" along the western border of the Soviet Union saw the rise of governments with communist leanings. In addition, the famine problem has been of equal importance to political issues in the past year. The thoughts and energy of the common people of Europe are focused on this.</p>

<h3>Third Day of Trial of Tojo and Others: All Defendants Plead "Not Guilty", Tojo's Defense Lawyer Accuses the Presiding Judge, Court Will Reconvene on the 3rd of Next Month</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Tokyo Correspondent, 6th] The Far East International Tribunal's trial of Japanese war criminals began at 9:30 AM today [the third day]. The situation was quite tense, and there were three recesses in between. Kiyose Ichiro, the chief defense lawyer for the war criminals and Tojo's defense lawyer, raised a dispute with Chief Prosecutor Keenan regarding a Japanese translation issue. Then, he accused the presiding judge, Webb, of having been responsible for investigating the atrocities of the Japanese army in New Guinea, and he inevitably harbors prejudice in his heart. If he still serves as the presiding judge, it cannot be said to be fair. After Kiyose Ichiro finished speaking, Webb announced a recess. Fifteen minutes later, the court continued, and New Zealand Judge Northcroft, representing the Far East International Tribunal, declared that the court was established in accordance with the Potsdam Declaration and that all judges were appointed by Allied Commander General MacArthur. After the third recess, Presiding Judge Webb asked the twenty-seven defendants [Okawa was not present] whether they admitted to the crimes they were charged with. First, he questioned the white-bearded Araki. Araki stood up and answered that he was not guilty, arguing loudly and eloquently, as if giving a long speech. At this time, Webb said: "This is not the time for you to give a speech. You only need to answer whether you plead guilty or not." Araki then said, "Not guilty!" Finally, when questioned Tojo, Tojo replied: "I believe that all the charges made by the prosecutor are not guilty." All twenty-eight Japanese war criminals pleaded not guilty in Japanese. Only Matsuoka answered in English, but when he answered in English, no one could understand him due to his low voice. Then, Presiding Judge Webb announced the adjournment. The court will reconvene on June 3. At that time, the prosecution will present the indictment for the first batch of cases, and then listen to the defendants' statements on June 13.</p>
<p>Pamphlet Discovered</p>

Webb also said: This pamphlet is entitled "Japan's Record and World Security." However, the court is heavily guarded, and it is unknown how it entered. The judges will not be affected by it in the slightest. In addition, Kobayashi, the lawyer for former Foreign Minister Matsuoka, appealed to the court, stating that his client, Matsuoka Yosuke, has been weak and ill for six years, and it is difficult for him to bear attending court twice. He requested permission for him to rest in another room and only come to court during the defense. The court asked whether Matsuoka was likely to collapse at any time. Kobayashi replied: Not likely. The Chief Clerk of the court agreed to give special consideration.</p>

<h3>Preserving His Reputation in Old Age, An Unpardonable Shame, Yan Jiachi Changes in His Old Age, Brought to Court in Public View, Hunched Back Transforms, Gasps for Breath, Admits to All Charges</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Judge Cao Jun elevated to the First Court of the High Court yesterday morning to begin the trial of the 74-year-old treacherous Yan Jiachi. Yan is from Dongting Mountain in Jiangsu and lives at No. 145, Lane 524, Jing'an Temple Road. During the late Qing Dynasty, Yan served as the Guangzhou Daotai and Chaozhou Prefect. After the establishment of the Republic of China, he once retired. In the fifth year of the Republic of China, he served as the Minister of Finance. Later, he served as the acting governor of Hunan Province. During the Anti-Japanese War, Chen Jin-hai, the rebellious "Finance Minister of the Reformed Government," considered Yan to be "highly respected" and invited him in various ways. In March of the 27th year of the Republic of China, he officially took office as the Vice Minister of the Puppet Ministry of Finance. In July of the 28th year, Yan collected opium taxes during his tenure and, together with Mr. Kawo, representative of the enemy's Zhengjin Bank, jointly discussed the organization of the "Huaxing Commercial Bank" and issued 3 million yuan of puppet currency. In March of the 29th year of the Republic of China, when Wang Jingwei organized the puppet national government, Yan served as the puppet Deputy Minister of Finance. At the beginning of the 31st year of the Republic of China, he served as the Puppet Inspector of the Supervisory Yuan. In mid-February of the 32nd year, he served as a member of the Puppet Economic Committee. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, Yan was arrested by our military organs along with other traitors and sent to the High Prosecutor's Office for investigation and prosecution. At about 9:00 AM yesterday morning, Yan walked into the courtroom under the gaze of a court full of onlookers. Yan had white hair, a hunched back, and gasped for breath. He was completely an old man. He wore a blue serge robe, cloth shoes, and gray-black leggings. He confessed to all the crimes mentioned by the prosecutor. However, he claimed that his joining the puppet government was completely due to Chen Jintao's dragging him into it, like a form of kidnapping, and was unavoidable. He also claimed that during his tenure in the puppet government, he had contacted Wu Shiji of the central government and rescued Liu Hongdang, Ni Guangzhu, Xu Jin, Lu Rong'an, and others, a total of eleven central underground workers. He also saved six American airmen from danger, so he also made a small contribution to the Anti-Japanese War and asked the court to summon Liu Hongdang and others to testify.

<h3>Liu Ruxiang Speaks Fluent Mandarin, Seeing His Family Is Heartbreaking</h3>

He spoke fluent Mandarin and made many excuses for the crimes he had committed. Judge Cao stated that the case was still awaiting further investigation and adjourned the hearing.

After returning to China, he served in the industrial and commercial circles and once served as the consul of Nagasaki and the secretary of the embassy. During the Anti-Japanese War, Liu became quite familiar with the Japanese Consul General in Hong Kong, Ta Min. Through his enticement, he colluded with the enemy and joined the puppet government. In March of the 29th year of the Republic of China, when Wang Jingwei organized the puppet government, he helped Zhou Fo-hai, who was his classmate, to establish the puppet Central Reserve Bank, disrupting the financial system. Liu served as the director and Director of the Business Bureau. In April of the 30th year, he concurrently served as the Director of the Public Debt Department of the Puppet Ministry of Finance. In September of the 31st year, he visited Japan and contacted the Japanese Imperial Printing Office regarding the printing of puppet currency. When the Puppet National Business Coordination Association was established, there were five control associations under it: rice, flour, grease, cotton cloth, and daily necessities, all of which Liu came forward to support. He also served as a director of the Puppet China-American Bank and a supervisor of the Puppet Central Savings Association. After the victory, he was arrested by our military organs and sent to the court. After investigation by the High Prosecutor's Office, the facts were confirmed, and he was prosecuted. The defendant retained the lawyers Yu Zhongluo as his defense. When he left the court, he requested to meet with his family, including two daughters and six sons. He met with them, asked about their daily lives, and spoke with a lot of bitterness.</p>
<h3>Li Dingshi Spirit is Depressed</h3>
<p>The Li Dingshi case was also tried on the same day. Li is from Wuxing, 44 years old, and lives at No. 78, Dunxin Road.

In September of the 27th year, he served as the Director of the Puppet Shanghai Public Utilities Bureau. In November of the following year, he served as the Deputy Minister of the Puppet Ministry of Transportation. In March of the 29th year of the Republic of China, when the puppet government was established, he served as a member of the Puppet Supervisory Yuan.

<h3>No Severe Heat This Summer, Based on Experience</h3>
<p>[Our Report] According to Father Long Xiangqi of the Xujiahui Observatory's prediction: If the climate in April of this year is warmer than usual, then this summer can be expected to be cooler than in previous years. According to past experience, the monthly average temperature changes greatly, so if the temperature in April is compared, the temperature in June can be expected to decrease. According to last summer, the average temperature of Ping's 50 was 6 degrees 5, which was the normal temperature for Hua (this 50 is the past temperature, 74 is not the normal temperature for April during the Hua year). Therefore, the climate was unusually hot last summer. According to records, only the temperature in April of 1873 was relatively mild. In that year, the average temperature in June was as high as 61.3 degrees Fahrenheit. Therefore, based on this speculation, the climate in June of this year is expected to be cooler.</p>

At the beginning of the takeover, the bureau had only one ferry. After successively fitting and repairing old ships, there are now six ferries in operation, and several more will be added soon. The farthest route has been extended from Wusong to Chongming. After the company is established, it also plans to transport cars by ferry. As for administrative implementation and management methods, the preparatory committee is currently formulating a plan and submitting it to the municipal government for approval.</p>
<h3>Suspicious Junk Searched; Large Quantity of Military Supplies Found; Twenty-Six People Awaiting Interrogation</h3>
<p>[Our Paper's Report] The patrol boat of the Wusong Sub-bureau of the Municipal Police Bureau's Water Police Division discovered a huge junk moored in Wusongkou on the evening of the fourth. There were many people on board, and their actions were suspicious. Therefore, Sub-bureau Chief Wu Kexiao ordered police officers to board the ship for questioning. They learned that the ship had come from the Zhejiang waters. To clarify the truth, they conducted a strict inspection and discovered a large quantity of military supplies in a secret location at the bottom of the ship, including machine guns, rifles, pistols, Thompson submachine guns, hand grenades, and explosives. All twenty-six people on board were immediately arrested for interrogation. It was found that only one of the twenty-six people was from Shaoxing, and the rest were all from Fujian. The case was submitted to the Municipal Police Bureau for review yesterday.</p>
<p>Public Buses - Increase in Vehicles</p>
<p>In addition, the Municipal Public Works Bureau is also gradually increasing the number of public buses in the city. The bureau has ordered fifty vehicles from the Executive Yuan's Relief and Rehabilitation Administration and will convert them into public buses to operate in areas of the city with inconvenient transportation, and at the same time increase the number of vehicles on existing routes. This plan is expected to be implemented in a few months. It is still uncertain whether the British-owned public bus company plans to resume operations, as the company's contract will expire in just over four years. However, the vehicles have all been destroyed or taken away by the Japanese and must be replaced in large quantities. However, according to the person in charge, it may be possible to restore a small portion.</p>

<h3>Repair Shop Established to Relieve Unemployed Workers - Old Workers of the Mint Petition</h3>
<p>[Our Paper's Report] The Shanghai Unemployed Workers Relief Committee was originally under the responsibility of Lu Jingshi, a special commissioner of the Ministry of Social Affairs. It has recently been transferred to the Municipal Government for handling, with Li Jianhua, Deputy Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, concurrently serving as the chairman of the committee. When the reporter visited Deputy Director Li yesterday, he said that the committee had distributed relief flour in three phases, amounting to approximately 160,000 bags to date. The target recipients are industrial workers, but less than one-tenth of the recipients have been able to find work so far. Therefore, they plan to first set up an auto repair shop to accommodate some unemployed workers. As for unemployed workers from Chongqing who have come to Shanghai, they will be centrally accommodated to facilitate relief efforts. It was also reported that about 200 old workers from the Central Mint before the war petitioned the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday afternoon to request that the factory accommodate them after failing to do so.</p>
<h3>Tax Revenue Increases Month by Month, but Income and Expenditure Still Difficult to Balance - Pu Zhengdong Reports on the City's Financial Situation</h3>
<p>[Our Paper's Report] Pu Zhengdong, Director of the Municipal Finance Bureau, reported on the city's financial situation at the Municipal Government's memorial week meeting yesterday morning. He stated briefly that the general revenue situation from January to April this year was approximately 800 million yuan in January, more than 1.14 billion yuan in February, more than 1.85 billion yuan in March, and more than 2.87 billion yuan in April. Expenditure figures are also increasing sharply month by month. From January to April of this year, the Central Government allocated more than 2.26 billion yuan in subsidies for national departments and recently allocated more than 4.78 billion yuan in national taxes to the city. However, after offsetting monthly income and expenditure, the deficit is still significant.</p>
<p>The financial revenue and expenditure system was approved by the Second Plenary Session of the Central Committee and will be implemented on July 1, but in fact, it may not be implemented until January next year. The revised content is that the three types of taxes that originally belonged to the local government but are now centrally managed – the deed tax, the business tax, and the land tax – will still be returned to the local government. However, it is stipulated that 30% of the business tax and 40% of the land tax will be allocated to the Central Government, while the inheritance tax will still belong to the Central Government, with 15% allocated to the local government.</p>
<h3>Cui Zhanggui, Deputy Manager of the Red Star Theater, Abducted</h3>
<p>[Our Paper's Report] Cui Zhanggui, a Ningbo native, is in his thirties and lives at No. 3 Jindeli, Menghua Street, Wenmiao Road, Nanshi.

<h3>A Local Self-Defense Organization Visits the Shanghai Defense Corps - Duties Limited to Assisting the Military Police in Maintaining Security</h3>
<p>— Our Reporter Wei Qing</p>
<p>A purely local self-defense organization—the Shanghai Defense Corps—was first established in 1924. Later, due to its outstanding achievements, it gradually expanded from Nanshi to Zhabei, Pudong, and Caohejing. Although it was limited by funding at the time, it was not as well-equipped as the Shanghai Volunteer Corps in the former concession. However, under the guidance of the Shanghai Municipal Government's Defense Committee in 1931, its organization and strength were gradually strengthened, finally achieving the goal of "self-defense and defending others."</p>
<p>On November 12, 1937, Shanghai fell, and the Defense Corps also announced its dissolution with the National Army's westward retreat. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, at the request of local gentry and merchants, Mayor Qian restored the organization on November 16 last year and merged the Chinese Team of the former Shanghai Volunteer Corps to form the Shanghai Defense General Corps. The city was divided into eight districts: Hudong, Hunan, Haxi, Hubei, Huzhong, Punan, Pubei, and Wusong, with Generals Ke Youlue and Zhang Jintang serving as the commander and deputy commander, respectively.</p>
<p>In order to understand the general situation and work overview of the organization since its establishment, the reporter specially visited Commander Rong yesterday. He is a graduate of the first class of the Whampoa Military Academy and the fourth class of the Army University. Judging from his attitude, you would not believe that he is a famous general who has been through many battles. In particular, in the Battle of Hengyang, he, together with Army Commander Fang Xianjue and the three division commanders Zhou Qingxiang, Ge Xiancai, and Rao Shaowei, fought bloody battles in the isolated city for as long as forty-seven days. Rong had just returned from inspecting the corps in various districts the day before. He said: "The general situation is good, but the quality of the current corps members in various districts is recognized as needing to be improved. Therefore, an education implementation outline has been formulated and distributed to various units for active training, which is expected to be completed by the end of July."</p>
<p>Because the allocation of firearms is insufficient, our members have decided to reduce the number of people. Recently, we are also planning to establish nursing teams in various districts to provide voluntary service to the community, but the most difficult thing is funding. He also said: "The outside world does not understand the actual situation of the corps and believes that we have ample funding. In fact, since its establishment, we have only relied on 50% of the entertainment tax and donations from various circles to maintain it. To date, the clothing costs have not been paid on time, and the entertainment tax subsidy approved by the municipal government is only for six months." In terms of strength, in addition to the corps in various districts, the general headquarters also has two standing corps and one special service squad and a heavy machine gun squad. The cadres of the standing corps are all official officers, and the members are young people who have passed the ideological, academic, and physical examinations. Because the corps is entirely a local self-defense organization, its duties are limited to assisting the military police in maintaining local security. During the winter defense period last year, the maximum number of personnel directly and indirectly participating in the duty reached 3,240. In addition, because all corps members are able to work hard, bear hardships, and serve enthusiastically, they have successively captured more than 80 bandits in more than 80 cases in five months. Ye Zubing, the adjutant of the Hubei District Corps, even died in the line of duty while catching bandits. At the beginning of last month, he was also ordered to guard the houses left by Japanese expatriates and be responsible for the defense of the suburbs and the guarding of warehouses everywhere. Starting this month, the defense has been strengthened, and all district corps and standing corps are participating in the duty.</p>
<p>Rong is very modest. He said that he welcomes all circles to criticize the work of the Defense Corps. If there are any suggestions to give them, they are very welcome.</p>
<h3>No Prospect of Jardine Matheson Ships Being Exported; Failure to Change to Using Chinese Crew Causes Serious Negotiations - Seamen's Union Submits Conditions to the Company</h3>
<p>[Our Paper's Report] The Jardine Matheson and Swire Shipping Companies were temporarily allowed to operate coastal routes due to the coordination of post-war relief goods. Now, Swire has designated ships and plans to expand to Guangzhou. The new ship Fuzhou, which arrived in Shanghai the day before, is not only unable to be exported due to the unresolved crew issue, but also involves the Jinan and Hubei ships. Not only is there no prospect of export, but also goods other than fruits have not been unloaded. This dispute is of great importance to the future of Chinese seamen. Jardine Matheson uses ships from the Zhongyin Shipping Company, while Swire uses its own ships. Before the Japanese invasion, there were more than 100 ships operating on the Yangtze River and coastal routes. After the Japanese launched the invasion of the South, the ships of the two companies successively retreated south, from Hong Kong, Singapore, and various ports in Southeast Asia to India. Except for senior officers such as the captain, chief mate, second mate, and third mate, who were British, the remaining business directors, helmsmen, stoker, deckhands, and service personnel were all Chinese. After the ships retreated to Southeast Asia and India, the Chinese were expelled, resulting in countless sacrifices or even becoming beggars, which was extremely tragic. After the victory, the two companies resumed operations and built new ships. Chinese people have also been employed on the old ships' holds and decks. However, the new ships use natives from the South Pacific Islands. The Swire Fuzhou, which came to Shanghai for the third time the day before, has not yet changed to using Chinese crew. The Shanghai Seamen's General Union immediately sent personnel to negotiate with Swire, stating that countless Chinese seamen served the company during the war and sacrificed their lives, and they should resume work now that the company has resumed operations. They also proposed conditions that mainly called for resuming work and providing pensions to the families of the deceased. Swire did not respond. Last Saturday, the seamen petitioned the British manager of the company, but to no avail. The goods from the Hubei, Jinan, and Fuzhou ships have not been unloaded. It is reported that the British manager of Swire went to the Seamen's Union yesterday to discuss the matter, but there was no result. Before this matter is resolved, there is no prospect of the three ships being exported.</p>
<h3>How to Handle Goods Not Suitable for Direct Relief? The American Chamber of Commerce Submits a Memorandum</h3>
<p>[Our Paper's Report] Relief goods supplied by the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) to China are often not suitable for direct post-war relief purposes. There has been much debate in all circles regarding the handling of such goods. It is now heard that the American Chamber of Commerce in this city has specially submitted a memorandum to Mr. Ormstead, the chief of the UNRRA representative in China, proposing that, without hindering the existing trade routes in China, allocation methods should be stipulated regardless of nationality. (1) American goods should be handled by the UNRRA liaison group set up by the American Chamber of Commerce; British goods should be handled by the UNRRA liaison group set up by the British Chamber of Commerce; responsible for maintaining close contact with UNRRA to be informed of the arrival, unloading, and transportation of various non-relief goods of UNRRA and reporting to the regular importers of the goods. (2) In principle, non-relief goods of UNRRA should be sold by the original American merchants for American goods and by the original British merchants for British goods; if the goods have distributors of other nationalities, they should still be sold by merchants of that nationality. (3) Goods with trademarks that already have exclusive distributors should still be sold by the exclusive distributors. Goods without trademarks and without exclusive distributors should be sold by distributors who distribute similar goods. (4) Goods that have never been imported before should be discussed and selected by the chambers of commerce of the countries of origin to select appropriate distributors. The memorandum concludes by saying that if the above recommendations are implemented, it will rationalize China's international trade and UNRRA can also obtain higher prices for selling these non-relief goods to purchase food and engage in other relief work.</p>

<h3>Black Market Emerges Under Gold-Dollar Kingdom's Price Control Policy</h3>
<p>— By Mao Shuqing, Special Correspondent in the US for this Newspaper's New York Airmail Edition, 25th Day</p>
<p>A week around Easter, I witnessed what Americans call "economic disorder" for the first time. Such a situation was unimaginable to me during my travels in Europe, and even before stepping foot on this new continent.</p>
<p>In many American military camps in Europe, there were mountains of bread, butter, and white sugar. Many sergeants, tired of managing the kitchen, would grab handfuls of food and throw them on the ground. I crossed the Atlantic on the warship William Mary, and on board, I saw American "roughnecks" throwing boxes of canned food into the sea. But here in New York, I couldn't even find butter. When a waiter at an American restaurant served me a small pat of butter, he made a grimace, letting me know that this was a great "favor."</p>
<p>No Butter, Small Piece of Beef Hung in Ham Window</p>
<p>It wasn't just butter. On Easter Sunday, "ham" was nowhere to be found in New York City. New York newspaper reporters Ferguson and Jardine co-authored an article: "Want Ham for Easter?" They said: Ham is gone now, not only can you (the reader) not buy it, but even we journalists can't buy it. "If you want to eat a little better, you can switch to fish, lamb, or chicken and duck."</p>
<p>"Beef is available, but you have to go through the black market. Beef merchants hang a small piece in the window with officially priced beef, but don't even think about it, it won't be your turn."</p>
<p>Thus, New Yorkers felt the pain. For five years, New York City averaged 1,627,851 pounds of pork consumed per week, and 6,607 cattle slaughtered. For a metropolis like New York, with nearly seven million people, this amount is absolutely essential. Now that both the Atlantic and Pacific wars have been won, New Yorkers have no meat to eat.</p>
<p>The Department of Agriculture knew this was an important issue, and two days before Easter, announced that 1,334,008 pounds of pork and 6,276 cattle would be shipped to New York during Easter week. Owen, a spokesman for the New York Fisheries Association, also announced that 750,000 pounds of fish would be supplied daily to New York City residents for consumption.</p>
<p>However, the people of New York were still dissatisfied. The New York Press Club recently issued a humorous notice, deciding to hold a dinner on the evening of April 25th at the Waldorf Astoria. They declared: "To comply with President Truman's instructions, the dinner will not include bread and butter, so as to conserve food for export." It is said that 1,600 news professionals will attend to support the "No Butter Movement." General Eisenhower will be one of the guests of honor.</p>
<p>Whether Ike will attend the Press Club's "grand occasion" remains to be seen. Anyway, the American people are extremely unaccustomed to the word "conservation." On a streetcar, a clerk told me: "If Americans were to talk about conservation, the war would have been lost long ago." Most Americans believe that only by frantically consuming can there be a large output.</p>
<p>Twelve People Strike, 100,000 Lose Milk</p>
<p>The reality is just like that. Not being able to buy things in the United States does not mean that there is nothing itself, things are there, but the system shackles it. To give a simple example: a few days before Easter, in the "South Side" area of ​​the East Coast of New York (once rumored to be near the new site of the United Nations), 100,000 people suddenly had no milk to drink because twelve milk foremen went on strike for failing to get a pay raise. Andrew, the director of the milk factory, refused to comply, so for several days, no milk was on the market. Most American babies grow up on milk, and this made many housewives very anxious. The New York Mirror put a large headline in the social news column: "Twelve People Strike, 100,000 Lose Milk!"</p>
<p>Even now, white sugar is still a rarity in New York. There is still a big disconnect between sugar production and consumption. Some time ago, the largest sugar factory, the "East Coast" Sugar Factory, had 4,400 workers strike for a pay raise. The East Coast Sugar Factory's production accounts for 70% of the entire United States. As a result, the Department of Labor rushed to mediate, and as a result, each worker received a wage increase of 15 cents per hour, and the problem was resolved.</p>
<p>The endless wave of strikes has not yet ended. The "Gold-Dollar Kingdom's" economic disorder is becoming increasingly severe. As a result, many social figures are looking for solutions, and finally, they believe they have discovered: "All evil lies in the Price Administration."</p>
<p>Republican Party Launches General Attack, Weicholt Fires First Shot</p>
<p>The Price Administration was a wartime production agency, one of Roosevelt's proud creations back in the day. Now that the war has ended victoriously, the Price Administration still exists. Because prices are managed, factory owners cannot arbitrarily raise the prices of finished products, and since factory owners cannot arbitrarily raise the prices of raw materials, workers naturally cannot arbitrarily raise their wages. As a result, workers strike, production decreases, and with reduced production, market supply is insufficient. Even if prices are restricted, "black markets" are inevitable everywhere. In this way, what was originally intended to manage prices for the sake of people's livelihood has resulted in making people's lives more difficult. The Republican Party has taken this matter as an important issue to attack the Democratic government, and after several meetings, launched a general attack in Congress.</p>
<p>The first to fire was Representative Weicholt of Michigan, who opposed extending price controls until the end of March next year. He said: Restricting prices will strangle production, and we can no longer let production decline. The slogan he put forward was: "Reasonable profit." "Why not allow capitalists to obtain reasonable profits while simultaneously raising workers' wages?"</p>
<p>On the same day, in the Senate's Economic and Financial Subcommittee, Republican Senator Taft of Ohio vehemently attacked the government's plan to stabilize finances and control prices, saying: "If I were in charge of price controls, I would give up two-thirds of the items and restore their freedom." He did not allow opponents to interrupt, and only allowed others to speak after he had finished speaking.</p>
<p>Chicago Has No Pork to Eat, Only Vegetables Can Be Used Instead</p>
<p>An Associated Press reporter telegraphed back to New York from Chicago, saying that Chicago had no pork to eat during Easter week. Butchers were unwilling to operate because of government price controls, and many housewives "replaced it with vegetables."</p>
<p>Chicago is the center of the American slaughterhouse market, and Chicago's problems were immediately reflected in Washington. Senator Combs, Chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, spoke about the lack of meat, saying that the only way to remedy the situation was to immediately lift controls.</p>
<p>At the Agriculture Committee seat, Mr. Schweitzer, the manager of the Chicago Beef Slaughtering Company, requested the lifting of controls, saying that during the week before Easter, the slaughtering company only received 185 head of cattle. This day last year, 4,103 head were purchased within the same week.</p>
<p>"Why? The government has restricted our purchase prices. We cannot raise prices to buy from farmers, so all the cattle went to the black market."</p>
<p>That day, at the meeting seat, Price Control Bureau spokesman Franken stated that the prices of all agricultural products were determined after consultation with Secretary of Agriculture Anderson. He admitted that agricultural products now have a black market, and the black market price is about 20% higher than the official price.</p>
<p>Price Control Chief Angrily Roars, Explains Prices and Currency</p>
<p>The most heated debate was still in the House of Representatives, where Price Control Chief Paul Porter personally explained the government's countermeasures in detail in response to market fluctuations, saying, "How could the government not know about these symptoms? But if there are no controls, prices will rise even more drastically. "Once prices rise, currency will inflate even more. Today, the United States already has a general inflation. If more and more currency is issued, people's lives will be unimaginable." He also seriously pointed out: Without price controls, only the interests of capitalists will be increased, while disregarding the interests of hundreds of millions of people.</p>
<p>Paul Porter pointed out that the current amount of currency in the United States has reached 225 billion US dollars. If price controls are lost for one year, then on this day next year, prices will rise by another 75%, or even 100%. By then, money will become worthless, and those who purchased wartime bonds, or deposited money in banks or insurance companies, will invisibly suffer damage from reduced purchasing power.</p>
<p>"Suppose I now propose in Congress that all private capital in the United States, including deposits, movable property, and immovable property, be taxed at a rate of 50% by the government. Some of you will definitely accuse me of being a communist or a madman." It can be seen that taxation is impossible. Since taxation is impossible, and price trading is free and unfettered, the result will inevitably increase the number of chips, inflate the currency, and eventually lead to people's livelihood becoming unsustainable.</p>
<p>Weicholt Insists on His Own Views, Allowing People to Freely Raise Prices</p>
<p>Paul Porter's speech was very somber and sincere. One congressman retorted him: trying to use price controls to contract the currency is like trying to catch fish by climbing a tree.</p>
<p>Representative Wadsworth of New York State attacked price controls most fiercely. Democratic congressmen were divided into two factions, with Southern Democratic congressmen centered on agriculture expressing sympathy for the Republican Party, advocating opening up prices and raising agricultural product prices.</p>
<p>The House of Representatives' vote on the price plan was on Thursday of Easter week. The debate that morning was the most brilliant. Republican stalwart Weicholt shouted loudly: "Production first. Only production can save the current difficulties." He insisted on his own views: "The more controls, the worse. Therefore, there is only the abolition of controls, and the abolition of the government's 'subsidy policy' for the manufacturing industry." Weicholt said: "The government does not need subsidies at all, creating trouble for itself. Let industrialists and businessmen freely raise prices, and once prices rise, there will be enough production." Representative Langen of Massachusetts immediately stood up to support him.</p>
<p>Democratic Congressman Monroe opposed these views, shouting: "The dark ages for all American consumers have arrived." Republican Congressman Spencer reminded the House to pay attention: "An organized collective force is plotting to overthrow the Price Control Bureau, which is working for the welfare of the people. But you should pay attention to the 95% of the people in the country, who will support the control policy, even though they are an unorganized group today."</p>
<p>Another Republican Congressman, Crawford, who supported the control policy, pointed out that last year alone, American consumers saved 36 billion gold dollars because of the control policy.</p>
<p>The Speaker announced the vote, and the result of the vote was 259 votes to 137 votes. Weicholt's proposal won. Of the 259 votes, 171 were Republican, and 88 were Southern Democrats.</p>
<p>The content of Weicholt's proposal is: (1) The control period of the control bureau, which should have been extended to the end of June next year, is advanced by three months to the end of March next year for complete termination. (2) Each manufacturer and wholesaler may add a "legal profit" for sale as needed. (3) From July 1st, the subsidy policy for pork butchers will be cancelled, and pork prices will be opened up. (4) Other subsidy measures for various goods will be completely abolished by the end of this year. (5) The Price Control Bureau and the Factory Advisory Committee will discuss the steps to be taken after the abolition of price controls next year.</p>
<p>The media has two completely different views on this matter. One believes that from now on, the United States can return from the wartime economic system to a peacetime situation, which can promote prosperity. But most believe that this is a capitalist economic system "reversing course."</p>
<p>Washington Housewives Petition, Requesting to Retain the Price Control Bureau</p>
<p>The most affected are probably the small citizens of the city. With the Price Control Bureau in existence, even though there may be no pork to eat for a few days, it is still tolerable. In the future, if prices are allowed to skyrocket freely and currency inflates, life may become a big problem. On the day Congress met, hundreds of housewives in Washington petitioned in front of the Capitol, requesting to retain the Price Control Bureau and not allow capitalists to do whatever they want.</p>
<p>The New York "Afternoon Paper" drew a cartoon of a black-faced executioner strangling O.P.A. (Price Control Bureau), with many people next to it reaching out and shouting: "We need him!"</p>
<p>In addition, he also drew a sinister portrait of Weicholt, with the note below: "5% of the people overwhelmed 95% of the national public."</p>
<p>That evening, the authoritative economist, the current Director of Economic Stabilization, Chester Bowles, gave a broadcast on the American Broadcasting Corporation, beginning by saying: "I am preparing to resign." Then he said that this action by Congress would cause a major economic disaster in the United States, destroying the budgets of thousands of families. "In this coming year, millions of consumers in our United States will never have a comfortable day again!" He said, "Let us open our eyes and see what difficult consequences will be created."</p>
<p>This authoritative economist has his own set of views. A month ago, he wrote an exclusive article in the "New York Times," in which he analyzed from various aspects that the continuing inflation in the United States would be a hidden worry for the world economy, especially for the United States itself!

<h3>London in Half a Year: A Casual Discussion of Current British Life</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Xueyan's Airmail Report from Our Newspaper on the 23rd</p>
<p>When we, a group of students newly arrived in Britain, stepped ashore, the first inconvenience we encountered was the difficulty in buying matches. Those of us who smoked were the most anxious. Gradually, we discovered that more and more items were either unavailable or severely restricted in quantity, requiring queuing at restaurants and finding hotels fully booked, all indicating a scarcity of goods. We even began to suspect that London might be less affluent than Chongqing. Whenever we spoke with older British people, they would sigh and say, "Guang Sheng, you're a new visitor, aren't you? You don't realize Britain has been impoverished by the war! The wealth of the British has been spent on defeating the fascists."</p>
<p>Children Eat Bananas, Adults Swallow Saliva</p>
<p>For those with digestive issues, the first hardship is the complete unavailability of fruit. Long-term residents of London say they haven't seen fruit in six or seven years. Last year, the year of victory, several thousand tons of bananas were finally imported around Christmas, and radio and newspapers treated it as major news. However, the government later announced that the quantity was too small and could only be distributed to children for Christmas. Thus, adults could only watch and swallow saliva, while the children beamed with joy, telling everyone how many bananas they had eaten. Once, I joked with a British housewife, "You British are so strange; you don't seem to like fruit at all, as you can't find any in the market." She became genuinely upset and said, "Mr. H, you really know how to make fun of people. Don't you know Britain has been impoverished by the war? Things we used to take for granted every day, we now have to give up... I really don't know how disappointed Tommy (British soldiers) will be when they return. They won't believe this is their own country anymore. After fighting for others for several years, they come home to find their homeland impoverished to this extent." Her words were filled with a sense of loss for the past.</p>
<p>Greatest Sacrifice to Protect Justice</p>
<p>Before the war, Britain ranked first in the world in terms of foreign trade and overseas investment. But during the war, foreign trade completely ceased, almost equaling zero. Overseas investments were either destroyed by the enemy or mortgaged or sold. Therefore, compared to before the war, there is no doubt that Britain is now impoverished. So, regardless of what impression foreigners have of her, the British themselves unanimously believe that Britain has made the greatest sacrifice in this war, becoming impoverished in the fight to defeat fascism. They insist that they fought to defeat fascism, implying that Britain did not fight for its own interests but for the principle of justice, meaning that their sacrifices were for the protection of justice. Indeed, this belief of the British is evident everywhere.</p>
<p>Order Clothes in Winter, Wear Them in Summer</p>
<p>For someone arriving in Britain from India, the most immediate inconvenience is clothing. India is in the tropics, where a light-colored suit can suffice for winter. But Britain is in the north. London's latitude is the same as Manchuria's. Even in the height of summer, it doesn't get too hot. So, those arriving in Britain from India urgently need to acquire more clothing, and the problem is often quite pressing. But in Britain, buying clothes is heavily restricted. First, you need a ration coupon, and applying for and receiving one usually takes ten days to two weeks. Even if you get one, the quantity you can buy is limited, of course. But even if you just want to buy ready-made clothes, if you go to ten stores, seven or eight of them will have samples but no stock. It takes some effort to find anything. If your size doesn't fit and you need to have clothes custom-made, then you're really out of luck. Shopkeepers will all say, in unison, that there's a shortage of labor and it will take six or seven months to deliver the order. In other words, clothes ordered in winter won't be ready until summer. Imagine how difficult that is.</p>
<p>Banned Luxury Goods, Focus on Utility Items</p>
<p>Almost a year has passed since the end of the war in Europe, and the pressure of labor shortages in Britain has not eased. As a result, the quality of general goods has also declined universally. All luxury items that were available before the war are banned from production. The market is flooded with utility items that are practical and don't focus on style or aesthetics. Everything you buy is "Utility"—outerwear is Utility, shirts are Utility, wool is still Utility, furniture is Utility, stationery is Utility, and even radios are Utility. We, a group of poor students, are fine with it because the prices are cheap, and sometimes we even find the quality quite good. But if high-ranking officials from within the country, still remember the woolens and fabrics produced in Britain before the war, now they have long disappeared from the market. So, they ask around, run into walls everywhere, and look genuinely distressed. What we students find most problematic is the difficulty in buying books. During the war, due to paper shortages, the printing of both new and old books almost completely stopped, and even the print runs of newspapers and magazines were severely restricted. Ordering a copy of The Times requires waiting six or seven months. Buying a small Oxford dictionary requires searching dozens of bookstores, and you still might not find one. As for more specialized reference books, you'll have to run around even more. You might not be able to find a single suitable one after searching all over London.</p>
<p>Food is Rationed, Nutrition is Not a Concern</p>
<p>People coming to Europe worry about insufficient nutrition. We had heard this said in our own country and also heard rumors in India. Later, on the ship, the British soldiers we spoke with talked about the food shortages in Britain. We were somewhat uneasy. As the ship approached Britain, the ship used the broadcasting system to explain the current living conditions in Britain, generally saying that Britain had made significant sacrifices during the war, so life was still very difficult. The intention was to prepare the travelers and returning soldiers for what to expect in Britain so that they would not be too disappointed after arriving. Some students, prone to unnecessary worry, were even more disheartened after hearing this. But in reality, after arriving in Britain, things were not as difficult as we had imagined. The main foods are rationed. Each person receives about two pounds of milk per week, one or two eggs (uncertain), several pounds of meat, and enough sweets and canned goods to barely get by. If you still feel insufficient, you can go to a restaurant for a treat. So, although the menu is monotonous and the taste is not to our liking, there is no concern about insufficient nutrition. And everything that is rationed is cheap. People coming from our country for the first time can't help but be delighted and energized when they see such cheap things.</p>
<p>Rational Control, Everyone Benefits</p>
<p>If we only look at one aspect of Britain, we might suspect that Britain is truly impoverished to the bone. In reality, it's not quite like that. According to many British students themselves, it's not very accurate to just say that Britain is poor. Perhaps saying "poor but not distressed" is more reasonable. In fact, as a result of this war, although the standards of enjoyment for some people in Britain have inevitably decreased, the lives of ordinary people are more secure, more equal, and more rationalized because of the government's proper control. For example, before the war, milk and eggs could be bought anywhere, but not everyone could enjoy them regularly. On the other hand, now, because of rationing, everyone has the same rights, without exception. Utility items cannot be compared to the luxury items that were available before the war, but they are good enough for practical use. And they are cheap, so every household can afford to buy them. Even in terms of general prices, they have only risen by about two to three times during the five years of war. This is quite remarkable. Even in a country as abundant in resources as the United States, prices have risen faster than in Britain. So, speaking calmly, the control of prices in Britain can be said to be very effective. Most British people also consider it satisfactory. As for the reasons for the particularly effective control, the most important is naturally the ability to control the source of goods. Britain is an island nation, and all goods rely on overseas supplies. Since the government controls the means of transportation, it effectively controls the source of goods. Since the goods are in the hands of the government, distribution is naturally easier and more rational, and price control is naturally more effective. We can almost say that Britain is an ideal country for price control. Secondly, there is the thoroughness of the system. When the government wants to control a certain item, it makes a realistic estimate and plan in advance. We know that the price of each item is closely related to other prices. To implement effective control, you must first consider all the factors affecting prices, prepare thoroughly, and then implement them. The people act in accordance with the law, and everything goes smoothly, step by step, without any problems. Otherwise, there will be trouble everywhere. If you only rely on the temporary whim of a cabinet minister, ordering the chief of public security and the president of the chamber of commerce to suppress prices, the result will inevitably be ineffective and may even stimulate price increases. Finally, strict enforcement is also one of the important reasons for success. Under the rationing system, no exceptions are allowed. If one person can be exempt, the rest can follow suit. For example, the peacetime industry in Britain is now gradually recovering. Artificial silk stocking (Nylon) factories have begun to resume production. One day, Queen Mary and Princess Elizabeth visited a factory. The factory gave them each a pair of stockings but at the same time asked them to hand over their ration coupons because the factory needed to recover a certain number of ration coupons based on the amount of raw materials and labor used. There was a quota, and no exceptions were allowed, even for the royal family. If the royal family could be exempt, why couldn't cabinet ministers be exempt? And so on, down the line, it would be difficult to find any more people who weren't exempt.</p>
<p>Black Market is Not a Topic of Conversation in Britain</p>
<p>Having said all this, some may ask, does Britain have a black market? My answer is straightforward: "Yes, but buying things on the black market in Britain is harder than buying things at official prices in our country." People arriving in London from our country always ask about the black market situation in Britain, as if they are more concerned than the British themselves. If you answer "very little," they don't seem satisfied. As for those returning to our country from Britain, they like to talk at length about the British black market, even more so. I had heard it several times when I was in our country. It is probably true that Britain has a black market, but we have been in London for almost half a year. Although I have seen news in the newspapers about punishing black market merchants, I have never witnessed a black market transaction. When students meet each other, they occasionally talk about the black market. Although everyone knows it exists, no one has personally experienced it. In fact, people in Britain rarely talk about the black market. In India, I often heard people talking about the British black market with great interest, showing that the black market is not a topic of conversation in Britain. People from black market countries are surprised by the lack of development of the black market business in Britain, so they inquire with particular zeal. A few people who came to Britain for a quick meeting and had to return to our country quickly were the most enthusiastic about black market investigations, but after investigating for a few weeks, by the time they were about to leave, they were still in the enthusiastic investigation stage and had not found any leads. So, I am even more convinced that the black market is not developed in Britain.</p>
<h3>The Bloody and Tearful Life of a Dancing Girl in Transition! "Pengchai Girls" in Hangzhou</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Chu Yusheng's Airmail Report from Our Newspaper on the 4th</p>
<p>In Hangzhou, the loudspeakers are filled with Shaoxing tunes, but around the Lakeside area, melodies like "Flame of Love" and "Busy Singer" are scattered, flowing from the dance halls onto the streets. These are the new entertainment venues after the victory.</p>
<p>These dance halls have been opposed by local people. The Provincial Assembly once asked the government to ban dancing girls and prohibit the opening of dance halls. The reason is that since the advent of dance halls, many jealous disputes have been staged from time to time, and Hangzhou is a simple and beautiful city. If these morally corrupt things spread, wouldn't they tarnish the sanctity of paradise?</p>
<p>Abolish Dancing, Let the Dancing Girls Marry</p>
<p>A certain gentleman with a considerable position in Zhejiang once spoke to the reporter about dance halls and dancing girls. He did not advocate banning dancing girls and prohibiting dancing. He said, "Hangzhou is a world-renowned scenic spot. In the future, many Europeans and Americans will come to visit. If there are no dancing girls and dance halls, wouldn't that be disappointing? And dancing is indeed a legitimate form of entertainment. Do we still advocate that men and women should not touch hands?"</p>
<p>Each has their own reasoning. Some of the dancing girls in Hangzhou are indeed not very good, but dancing is not necessarily a heinous thing. The question of whether to abolish or retain them is indeed a current issue. The municipal government is still collecting dancing entertainment taxes, but the provincial government has specially sent personnel to study whether to ban them altogether. People in the provincial government have asked, "Should dancing girls be banned?" Someone replied, "What about their way out?" People in the provincial government said, "They can be allowed to marry!"</p>
<p>Eighty Dancing Girls, Four Dance Halls Announced</p>
<p>In Hangzhou, there are a total of four dance halls: one is the China Restaurant, on Yingzi Road; one is the West Garden, on Yingshi Road; one is the West Lake Restaurant, on Yanzhao Road; and one is the Jingu Restaurant, at the corner of Jincheng Hotel on Yanzhao Road. These four dance halls, China Restaurant has twenty-five dancing girls, West Garden has twenty dancing girls, Jingu has fifteen dancing girls, and West Lake has ten dancing girls. Roughly calculated, there are about eighty. Compared with Shanghai, it is really a small potato compared to a big yam. Among these four dance halls, the dance floor of China Restaurant is the largest, but it is far inferior to the Paramount, Lido, and Ciel Rouge in Shanghai, only equivalent to the larger dance floors in Shanghai coffee shops.</p>
<p>A Certain Boss, Called King Yama</p>
<p>The price of each of their dance tickets is 2,400 yuan, which is distributed as follows: 900 yuan for the municipal government's entertainment tax, 600 yuan for the dance hall, 300 yuan for the dancing girl's boss, and 600 yuan for the dancing girl. As above. The dancing girl's boss specializes in recruiting young girls, dressing them up, teaching them to dance, and then putting them on the market. The boss is male, and the dancing girls are very afraid of the boss. The China Restaurant has a boss whom the dancing girls call "King Yama." He owns more than half of the dancing girls in Hangzhou. People in the industry call him "Red Boss." These many dancing girls all speak Shanghainese. When asked, "Where is your home?" they always like to say "Shanghai." In fact, it is a question how many of them are actually from Shanghai. Their level of education is not very high. Generally speaking, they are mostly at the elementary school level. A few have some difficulty writing. Occasionally, one or two have a high school or middle school level. It is said that Bai Mengying, who recently went from Shanghai, has a high school level of education.</p>
<p>Pengchai Girls, Cannot Be Called Dancing Girls</p>
<p>I once talked to several dancing girls about the theory of dance. They stared blankly and didn't know what to say. They said, "We only know how to take one step with Pengchai." So they really cannot be called dancing girls, nor can they be called dancing partners, but only "Pengchai girls."</p>
<p>One dancing girl said: "We charge 600 yuan per table. The most popular dancing girl can sit at most six tables a night, which is 3,600 yuan. A month is only 100,800 yuan. Buying a pair of socks and a pair of leather shoes is almost gone. What benefits are there to speak of? Some people still have parents, siblings, to support. When there is no other way, they can only get close to the dance guests to get some benefits."</p>
<p>Another dancing girl said: "So and so was sleeping in a hotel when they encountered a room check. They asked what her profession was. She said she was a dancing girl, so they wanted her to perform a nude dance." "Another time, a group of people in uniforms ran into the dancing girl's dormitory and insisted that so and so accompany them out to play. If she didn't, they would take out their guns!" "So and so was slapped in the face by someone in uniform." "So and so was forcibly kept outside for several nights."</p>
<p>These dancing girls wear fashionable clothes and gold and diamond jewelry. But when you listen to them talk, they all have a sad story of being wronged. Dancing girls have become inferior girls today.</p>
<p>Common Covenant, Dancing is Not Prostitution</p>
<p>When the citizens of Hangzhou became very interested in the dance hall issue, the provincial and municipal women's associations organized a Dancing Girl Life Improvement Association for them, with the dancing girls themselves serving as director and deputy director, holding a life improvement forum once a week, and soon they will be trained.</p>
<p>I once participated in their forum. Their chairman was too shy to speak. Later, they discussed life issues, feeling that the income of 600 yuan per dance ticket was too little, and demanded an increase, otherwise they would strike. No strangers are allowed to come and go in the dancing girl's dormitory after one o'clock at night and before seven o'clock in the morning. The dormitory is too dirty and requires the dance hall to find a way to clean it to maintain hygiene.</p>
<p>The provincial and municipal women's associations also put forward a common covenant for the dancing girls, asking everyone to abide by it. The first article clearly states, "Dancing is not prostitution."</p>
<p>Willing to Work, Unwilling to Be a Dancing Girl</p>
<p>One young dancing girl said: "I would rather work, I don't want to be a dancing girl anymore, but hoping to get a job is also a difficult thing."</p>
<p>We visited their dormitory. A dozen people live in one room. The light in the room is not very sufficient. In the dimness, they hurriedly took out mirrors, dressed up, put on fashionable clothes, and forced a smile, preparing to go to the dance party. Before they put on makeup, everyone's face was yellow and gaunt, and their tired eyes that hadn't woken up showed their background.</p>
<p>They themselves are also saying that they want to respect the personality of dancing girls, but with limited education and while they are young, how can they withstand the temptation of the guests? Although some experienced dancing girls have also cheated the guests out of money, what is that compared to the selling of the soul? I once asked: What about the dancing girls with a high school education? They told me, "Sisters with a high school education are more open-minded, so they are more romantic!"</p>
<p>They have never thought about it, and probably dare not think about their future. Yes, they can marry! But who to marry? The dance halls in Hangzhou have evolved to this point, who should be responsible for this?</p>

<h3>Harvard University President Discusses American Education</h3>
<p>[New York, U.S. News Agency, 5th] Harvard University President Conant recently published an article in the New York Times, raising the following questions:</p>
<p>Raising Various Questions</p>
<p>(1) In the future, should we aim to help every aspiring individual enter university? (2) If so, what methods should we use to determine who can attend university and who cannot? (3) Will there be an overabundance of four-year liberal arts graduates, creating a large number of unemployed individuals who harbor resentment towards the education system they experienced? Dr. Conant said, "After the American Soldier's Bill of Rights was announced, a large number of people will enter university. In a few years, the current emergency situation may disappear, but this abnormal development may affect long-term education plans. "I believe that one of the most sublime and important concepts in America is equality of opportunity, as it has been in the past and as it is now. This concept, on the one hand, is a changing and fluid social structure, and on the other hand, it is mutual respect among various professions and economic units. In short, there is absolutely no bias towards any class. In the past fifty years, the power of education has been advancing for America. As a result of expanding universal education to the high school system, it has created a powerful tool for American democracy. The closer we get to the goal of equality of opportunity (which, in fact, can never be fully achieved), and at the same time, the better our schools teach and implement the basic principles of American democracy, the more opportunities for individual freedom there will be."</p>
<p>Developing Public Education</p>
<p>Dr. Conant advocated developing public education in two directions: (1) Establishing more institutions similar to junior colleges, because most young people, after receiving two years of vocational training after graduating from high school, can handle many types of occupations. (2) Establishing a national scholarship system so that young people with special skills can be sent to vocational and higher education centers for study. Dr. Conant said, "In order to achieve these two goals, the government must spend sufficient education funds." He also pointed out, "For most Americans, whether a bright young person can receive education higher than high school depends on the family's economic situation. High schools in cities allow young people to obtain greater education with very little tuition, while young people in small towns and rural areas cannot enjoy this benefit. Only government funding can promote educational opportunities in small towns and rural areas."</p>
<p>Achieving Equality of Opportunity</p>
<p>Dr. Conant concluded, "The responsibility of guiding young people, which is extremely important, must not be ignored, because it is the cornerstone of a broad education system, the purpose of which is to achieve the principle of equality of opportunity. As we look forward to the future of education, we hope to improve the guidance system, expand public education, and develop our greatest national asset—children—in a wise manner, thereby strengthening our free society."</p>
<h3>University Professors in This City to Organize a Cooperative</h3>
<p>[This City News] The University Professors Association of this city held a joint meeting of directors and supervisors the night before last to discuss the organization of a commodity cooperative for the benefit of its members.

<h3>European and Asian Groups to Replace Books</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 5th] The Carnegie Endowment for International Peace Committee announced today that it plans to replace books for 200 libraries in Europe and Asia. The books in these libraries were lost during the war.</p>
<h3>Out-of-School Youths in Northern Jiangsu Abandon Homes and Wander the Streets, Without Food or Shelter, Hoping for Sympathy and Effective Assistance from Society</h3>
<p>[Reported by Our Newspaper] The Shanghai Refugee Alumni Association of Suhua Middle School recently published a statement addressed to prominent figures, stating: "Our alma mater, Suhua Middle School, was born in the early years of the War of Resistance and developed in the chaotic North Jiangsu. It has the characteristics of wartime education and a purely militarized character, which aroused the infinite hatred of the enemy, puppets, and bandits. It was destroyed once by the enemy, twice by the puppet army, and three times by the treacherous bandits. Our unyielding, benevolent, and loving principal, Mr. Zhou Huiyin, shouldered the responsibility of the school again and again, tirelessly leading us towards the path of resistance. Because of this, he was increasingly envied. Under the environment of the enemy, puppets, and bandits, he was finally kidnapped by the bandits, and all the school buildings and equipment were burned down. Although the incident was almost cruel, it further increased our understanding of the bandits and our determination to resist. Not long after, our principal escaped unharmed, and we looked up to him to continue leading us and cultivating us, but he was eventually summoned by General Tang Enbo, the commander of the current Third Front Army. From then on, we lost our reliance and became lost lambs. Last year, he returned with victory, but our classmates scattered in various counties of Northern Jiangsu were even more trapped in a tragic fate. If the treacherous bandits learned that we had studied at Suhua, they would first monitor us and then immediately persecute us. According to what we have seen and heard, as many as sixty or seventy people were brutally murdered because of this. This had to make us leave our parents, brothers, and sisters, abandon our lovely hometown, and embark on the road of deep exile. Now, there are no fewer than one hundred or so people gathered in Shanghai, some relying on relatives and friends, some wandering the streets, and even those without food or shelter, waiting for help. We not only look up to our principal to lead us, but also hope that people from all walks of life will show us sympathy and provide us with effective assistance, so that we will not go astray and become corpses on the road in a foreign land."</p>
<h3>Wuhan Elementary School Students Receive Milk Powder Every Morning</h3>
<p>[Dahua News Agency, Hankou] The Wuhan Relief Sub-Office recently determined that the physical condition of children in the three towns of Wuhan was poor, and after consultation with the head office, it agreed to convene the principals of public and private elementary schools in the three towns to discuss the distribution of milk powder. The milk powder will be claimed by each school. After being boiled with water, it will be provided to students every morning. The milk powder will not be distributed directly to prevent abuses.</p>
<h3>Education Bureau Formulates Flexible Measures for the Qualification of Secondary School and Normal School Teachers</h3>
<p>[Reported by Our Newspaper] In order to improve the quality of teachers in secondary and normal schools in this city, the Municipal Education Bureau has formulated qualification assessment measures. However, since it is inconvenient for teachers from various schools to personally go to the bureau to fill out application forms, the bureau has decided to provide flexible measures to facilitate them. Each school can send a letter to the Education Bureau to collect application forms, which will be distributed to the teachers by the school.

The process was not good. Nong opened at 2,330 yuan, first falling slightly due to the gold price, and then the supply of funds increased one after another due to tight credit. At noon, it was close to the 2,200 yuan mark. In the afternoon, it finally broke. As a result, it fell back by 100 yuan compared with last Saturday.

The Han Gang absorbed a lot of 42-count double-strand money, and the price rose by 230,000. However, because of the fatigue in Guangzhou, the Guang Gang had no intention to enter the market yesterday, so the upper body yarn such as Shuangma was slightly lower. At noon, Fangjian opened yarn as usual, from 1 to 100 counts, all colors were available. From 42 counts and below, each price was 30,000 to 80,000 higher than the previous period.

<h3>Coal Prices are Stable</h3>
<p>The source of white coal was blocked due to labor unrest in the Haifang area. However, there were sporadic arrivals from Tianjin, and the inventory of white coal in Shanghai was abundant, so the market price remained stable. The foreign routes of bituminous coal dross have become less frequent, and the actual sales in Shanghai are also sluggish, and the market has reported another collapse. However, because the quantity of bituminous coal blocks distributed by the industry this time is very small, the market situation is still stable.</p>
<h3>Reduced Sugar List Prices</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market was extremely mediocre due to tight credit and sluggish actual sales. The Association's listed prices for medium-grade white sugar initially were 60,000 yuan, then dropped to 59,500 yuan to 59,000 yuan.

<h3>Jasmine Tea: Stockholders Hoarding and Not Selling</h3>
<p>In recent days, tea merchants have been hoarding jasmine tea. This is because new tea will not be available for some time, and since the taste for old tea has improved, the market's inventory has been dwindling. Therefore, people are uniformly optimistic, creating a situation of supply falling short of demand. The market is stable and promising. As for other varieties, both local merchants and Suzhou merchants have been replenishing their stocks, and their base prices are solid. Currently, the African and Moroccan markets have a strong demand for special grade, small bud green tea. Unfortunately, due to transportation issues, no progress has been made so far.

<p>(7) The use of the loan is limited to (1) the price of purchasing fresh cocoons, (2) the opening of cocoon shops and drying costs, and (3) the cost of storing dried cocoons. The applicant manufacturer will fill out an application form, which will first be approved by China Silk and then sent to the banking group for discount processing. Each factory will negotiate a discount agreement according to the approved amount, and issue term bills according to the needs of cocoon collection, with proper guarantees, for discount to the banking group.</p>
<p>(8) The Bank of China's funds have already been disbursed. The cocoon collection must begin immediately. Before the funds are fully collected, it has been decided that the Bank of China will temporarily advance the funds and then transfer them to the banking group.</p>

<h3>Relying on Seniority and Selling Old Age</h3>
<p>— Cheng Tie'an</p>
<p>I overheard someone expressing the "China is Good" theory:</p>
<p>He said: "Chinese things have permanence. The Xi'an stone tablet, the most recent one, is already more than 1,200 years old, and the inscribed words are still very clear. The ancient bronze bell in Guangxi, a relic of the Qin and Han dynasties, still rings very loudly when used as an alarm bell..."</p>
<p>"Chinese rosewood furniture, as long as it is well maintained, becomes more and more beautiful with use."</p>
<p>"When Chinese soldiers march, they are already exhausted when they are still far from the battlefield, but when they reach the front line, they achieve surprising results."</p>
<p>China has suffered from the disadvantage of "relying on seniority and selling old age." Believing that it is a cultural country with thousands of years of history, it can be as solid as a rock. While others are running forward, it still stands still, boasting of its "old age."</p>
<p>Let me tell you: "Now is not the time to 'sell old age'."</p>
<p>Special Feature</p>
<h3>Sun Temple</h3>
<p>— Lü Changzui</p>
<p>Sun Temple, such an unfamiliar place name, of course, not many people know about it. Even some people who know about it will think that this is a place not worth mentioning.</p>
<p>This unfamiliar and unworthy place, now if I don't specifically introduce it, I think that in the future, I'm afraid that few people will care about it. Because the people who live here, like me, who know a few characters, are simply very few. Even some people who know a few characters are breathing and sweating all day long for the sake of life, and they don't even have the leisure for defecation and urination. It is absolutely impossible to ask them to remember the things of Sun Temple. Now, because I have stopped my business and have energy that no one wants, I sit in the thatched cottage with nothing to do, so I use this free time to briefly introduce the situation of our Sun Temple.</p>
<p>Sun Temple is a part of Zhabei. The first railway bridge after the train departs from the North Station is the jurisdiction of this area. The characteristic here is that there are no foreign houses like those along Linsen West Road, and tiled houses are rarely seen. They are mostly thatched cottages that you have to lower your head to enter.</p>
<p>Sun Temple should be a place where you can see the sun every day, right? The sun may be there every day, but we who live in Sun Temple are indeed far from seeing the sun. Most people have to go to the factory gate to wait for work before dawn. People who come out of the factory with a body full of fatigue, once they enter the thatched cottage, fall asleep without even taking off their clothes.</p>
<p>It would be terrible if the people who live here were to think about the preciousness of the sun. But if they really understood the preciousness of the sun, they wouldn't come to live in Sun Temple. However, when it has been raining for a long time, the road has turned into mud, making it difficult to walk, and the house is so damp that it becomes moldy, and even breathing is difficult, they also hope that the sun will come out, dry the road for easy walking, and drive away the mildew in the house for good sleep.</p>
<p>Among the residents here, those who sell their energy in factories along Xiaoshadu and Guojia Ferry account for the majority, followed by rickshaw pullers.</p>
<p>People generally think that those who sell their energy and pull rickshaws are mostly from Jiangbei. In fact, this is not the case. Although a considerable proportion is indeed from the Jiangbei area, there are also many from other places. They often carry the property of their entire family in batches and walk to Shanghai. My house has no "gold bars," so most of them gather here. As soon as they arrive here, in less than three days, a new village is found in the open space. The prosperity of Sun Temple depends entirely on these refugees who come from far and wide.</p>
<p>Sun Temple is also a place that people look down upon the most, because it is a slum—a refugee or beggar settlement. People with slightly neater clothes are reluctant to come here, supposedly because they are afraid of getting infectious diseases. Even passengers sitting on the Shanghai-Nanjing or Shanghai-Hangzhou trains rarely don't feel disgusted when they see the thatched cottages in this area. Some foreigners who come to China for the first time look around with contempt and curiosity.</p>
<p>It is true that if you take a train westward, after leaving the North Station, you will see a long cement wall five or six li long next to the railway tracks. At first, I didn't understand what it was built for. Later, a friend told me, and I suddenly understood: it turned out that it was more than ten years ago. Some wealthy people felt uncomfortable when the train they were riding passed through Sun Temple. They thought that the train should not pass through places where you can see these unsightly thatched cottages. Especially since entering the gate of Shanghai by land, the first thing you encounter is a messy pile of thatched cottages. The locals don't care when they see it, but when foreigners see it, it not only spoils the scenery of Shanghai, but also tarnishes China's reputation. At first, they advocated completely demolishing it, but then they changed their approach and built this cement wall to separate the railway from the Sun Temple area. Unfortunately, because of this war, many places have been destroyed, and you can still see the truth of the other side from the gaps in the train.</p>
<p>We don't have street lights here. In fact, we don't need street lights. Some people are even afraid of seeing firelight at night. There are also no newsstands. There are very few literate people, and no matter what major events happen in the country, the news will not reach here. Extra editions or evening newspapers never come here to call for subscriptions. There are probably no more than two telephones, so when a fire starts, the fire truck won't come until the sky is red.</p>
<p>Sun Temple can also be said to be an area without chickens or dogs. Chickens will disappear before they grow up; even stray dogs from outside are considered lucky if they can survive for more than an hour after entering this area. However, there are quite a few pigs, and they are treated very well, living in the same house as people.</p>
<p>In the early morning, you can often find newborn babies wrapped in tattered cloth bags by the roadside. Some are already dead, while others are still alive, waiting for stray dogs to end their lives. If infants had consciousness, in a world like this where you can't see the sun, I think they wouldn't want to linger.</p>
<h3>"Feet on the Ground"</h3>
<p>— Chen Shan</p>
<p>According to a person from Province B, the lives of university professors in the interior are really miserable now. Their income is low, their expenses are high, and they have no choice but to find side jobs: they ask their wives to farm and act as cooks. For example, if she is from the Lower Yangtze region, she can cook some Lower Yangtze dishes and make some snacks for sale. Some even ask their children to go to the streets to peddle them. At first, everyone was embarrassed and didn't dare to do so openly, but later, life forced them too hard, and they really had no choice. So, they acted in unison, and there was nothing rare about it.</p>
<p>There is an old professor who is a scientist and has been studying biology and teaching for decades. When people see him, they always jokingly say to him: You really have "feet on the ground." He actually accepts it without shame. It turns out that the soles of the leather shoes he wears are already badly damaged, but he doesn't have the money to buy new ones, and he is still enthusiastically studying biology while wearing those old, broken leather shoes.</p>
<h3>Allergies and Heredity</h3>
<p>— Chong Fan</p>
<p>Allergies are related to heredity. Dr. Longs, an American expert who studies allergies, says: People have a tendency to develop allergies due to heredity, but the symptoms vary from person to person and are not consistent. If both parents have a certain allergy, the child often shows signs of heredity before the age of ten; if one of the parents has a certain allergy, the child often shows signs of heredity after the age of ten. However, sometimes even if both parents have a certain allergy, the child may not show any signs of allergy, so Dr. Wan Longs says that physiology is ever-changing.</p>

<h3>"Washing the Face but Not the Neck"</h3>
<p>— Shui</p>
<p>People wash their faces for cleanliness and beauty.</p>
<p>According to the rules: the face and neck are connected, and both are exposed outside the collar. Therefore, when washing, one should wash the neck and ears together to be beautiful and clean. However, many people are careless and only care about the appearance, so they just wash their faces with a few strokes and finish hastily. As a result, the 'face' is very beautiful, but what about the neck? It is ugly with a "dark and shiny" appearance.</p>
<p>Therefore, the people in my hometown once called it "washing the face but not the neck."</p>
<p>Originally, this kind of rude saying is very common and will not surprise people, but if you think about it carefully, it is a satirical remark that "although the language is humorous, it contains a very deep meaning."</p>
<p>If you don't believe me, I'll tell you two answers here:</p>
<p>First: When I was studying in middle school in Baoding, the principal always said this during every memorial week or when he convened student self-government officials to give instructions: Young people should not be perfunctory or cheat in their work, and they should be down-to-earth and thorough, especially not just scratching the surface. For example: if you have done a good job in your lecture rooms and dormitories, you should also make your toilets, dining halls, and kitchens tidy and clean. Otherwise, it will be like the saying in the countryside: "Washing the face but not the neck."</p>
<p>Second: General Feng Wangxiang's strict military discipline is well known to everyone. In the past, when he inspected the cleanliness of the barracks, he always looked at the toilets and warehouses first, and he didn't go to the lecture hall or the barracks. What's the reason? He said: "Rouge and powder are always applied to the face. The lecture halls and barracks are guaranteed to be: the quilts are folded like square tofu, and the guns are arranged like fish scales, so neat and clean, but what about the toilets and warehouses? They must be done perfunctorily. Therefore, I would rather not go to the lecture hall and barracks, but I cannot but go to the toilets and warehouses." Because the importance of these two places is comparable to the lecture hall and barracks, and they are classified as one category.</p>
<p>Therefore, General Feng often encouraged his subordinates with the following colloquialism: "This kind of thing is just like people washing their faces. Suppose your face is washed white, but your neck is dark and shiny and not washed at all. As a result, when your black neck is discovered, your beautiful face has been uglified by the black neck. At that time, no matter how beautiful your face is, what's the use! Isn't this just like the saying: "Washing the face but not the neck"?"</p>
<p>I hope all officials and ordinary people, high and low, big and small, throughout the country, please ask yourselves whether you are also committing this "washing the face but not the neck" problem?</p>

<h3>The Days of Suffering are Over</h3>
<p>— Yang Mou</p>
<p>When Japan surrendered, friends met and sincerely congratulated each other: "The days of suffering are over." But a new gloom enveloped the entire continent, and everyone was worried that the ominous omen was like a storm about to break out over the mountains.</p>
<p>Now that the Kuomintang-Communist truce order has been issued, this time we should really congratulate each other: "The days of suffering are over." Victory brought us the end of destruction, and unity brought us the beginning of construction.</p>
<p>Opening up the modern history of our country, it is truly a page condensed with blood and tears. Internal troubles and external aggression, natural disasters and man-made disasters, have never stopped for a moment. Now it can be regarded as a complete write-off, and we must rebuild our paradise on the ruins!</p>
<p>The days of suffering are over! We are delighted! However, we must be extra persevering, hardworking, and strive hard to ensure that we will not have a second day of suffering!</p>
<p>A great era has already begun before us. The motherland needs us to pour blood and sweat into the earth to cultivate beautiful and brilliant flowers. Listen! The motherland is calling us!</p>
<p>The days of suffering are over! But this will never allow for complacency and selfishness. In the past eight years, the blood and sweat of many martyrs have laid the foundation for the motherland. Now, now it is time to grow leaves, bloom flowers, and bear fruit!</p>
<p>We are born in this era, and we should be glad for ourselves.</p>
<h3>Ticket Vending Machine</h3>
<p>— Fang</p>
<p>Major train stations in the United States will soon adopt a new type of ticket vending machine. The machine prints and sells tickets automatically, which is very fast. Passengers buying tickets do not have to crowd and wait, and station staff will not be in a rush.</p>
<p>It is said that this machine is not a new invention. It was designed and manufactured by an Englishman one hundred and fifty years ago. European countries have used it for many years, but the American version has been slightly improved. The size is similar to a cash register, and it can print one hundred different station names. The printed ticket is two inches square, with the origin and destination, date, fare, number, and other instructions.</p>

<h3>Eradicating the Welcoming God Festival</h3>
<p>— Shen Zhensheng</p>
<p>Every year on the Buddha's Birthday, rural areas universally hold a kind of welcoming God festival. Although this kind of welcoming God festival is enough to waste money and damage property, in the countryside, whether superstitious or non-superstitious, everyone is excited and happy to support this welcoming God festival. The reasons can be attributed to the following:</p>
<p>(1) Superstition - believing that the power of gods and Buddhas can be used to drive away human epidemics and plant epidemics.</p>
<p>(2) Adjusting the spiritual nature - rural areas are busy all year round and have no place to adjust the spirit, so they have a fair and play during the bright spring and fragrant flowers.</p>
<p>(3) Showing off nature - since the outbreak of the war by the Japanese invaders, how many people have made a fortune from the national crisis? They have both the idea of seeking protection from gods and Buddhas and the idea of showing off, so they spend a lot of money to support this welcoming God festival. Based on the above three reasons, even when the cost of living is extremely high and everything is required to save costs, the welcoming God festival is exceptionally lively.</p>
<p>After we understand the cause of the welcoming God festival, we know that it is useless to use pure forced prohibition, and we must use the following fundamental cure methods:</p>
<p>(1) Improve the culture of farmers, so that they know that the mysterious magic power of gods and Buddhas has long lost its value in this era of scientific advancement.</p>
<p>(2) Establish rural entertainment venues, rural libraries, rural tea gardens and other proper recreational places.</p>
<p>(3) Demolish improper temples and rebuild rural entertainment venues and other public welfare places, so that farmers lose their superstitious dependence and know that mysterious magic power is unreliable. The above three methods are the fundamental cure for the welcoming God festival. If they can be implemented according to law, not only can the trend of the welcoming God festival be eliminated, but it is also a necessary step in rural construction. I hope that the society will reach a consensus and jointly participate in this grand event.</p>

<h3>Based on Scientific Standpoint to Explain the Efficacy of DDT</h3>
<p>Letter from the Research Institute of China Biochemical Pharmaceutical Factory</p>
<p>To the Editor:</p>
<p>Having read the DDT automatic spray bomb advertisement published by the manager of Haisheng Company in your newspaper on April 24, in which it says "Each room only needs six to eight seconds," according to a scientific standpoint, the following should be added: (1) The spray bomb needs to be sprayed for six to eight seconds in a twelve-square-foot room to deal with flies, mosquitoes, and other smallest flying insects. (1) The spray bomb needs to be sprayed for forty-five to sixty seconds in a fourteen-square-foot bedroom to deal with fleas. (1) The spray bomb needs to be sprayed for forty-five to sixty seconds to deal with ants. (1) The spray bomb needs to be sprayed for fifteen to twenty seconds to deal with moths. (1) The spray bomb needs to be sprayed for thirty to forty-five seconds to deal with bed bugs.</p>
<p>The above refers to the time of spraying. As for the time for insects to be poisoned to death, mosquitoes and flies will die within half an hour, bed bugs will die within a few hours, and cockroaches will die within a week. I hope that you can publish this so that the people of the country can have a deeper understanding of the use of DDT.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>The Research Institute of China Biochemical Pharmaceutical Factory</p>
<h3>Answers to Readers</h3>
<p>Li Deming asked (1) I have been responsible for all the living expenses of my late parents for seventeen years. My late father has been dead for eight years, and I am still supporting my late mother. Does my late mother have full power to sell the property? (2) Is the power of attorney to sell the house signed by my late mother at the instigation of Bing legally valid? (3) I am unable to publish the denial of the sale in the newspaper. Is it legally valid to send a registered letter to the buyer (Yi) stating the denial of the sale for future negotiations? (4) The house is in Yancheng, Northern Jiangsu. Last November, I filed a lawsuit with the current organization (please note this point) denying the sale, but it was not resolved reasonably. Now the situation in the area is special and there is no way to negotiate. Is it effective to file a lawsuit with the formal court again in two or three years to recover the property rights? (5) On what date was the Executive Yuan's order "The transfer of land during the period of the occupied territories is generally invalid according to law" published in the newspaper? Does this order apply to this house? Please answer the above five questions.</p>
<p>Lawyer Zhu Yakui answered (1) The inheritance must be jointly owned by all the heirs. Without the consent of all the joint owners, the disposal is invalid. (2) If it is not your intention (proof is required), you can request to revoke it. (3) It can also be effective. (4) It can be effective. (5) It cannot be applied unless it is forced to sell by relying on the power of the enemy puppets.</p>
<p>Liu Linqi asked My wife claimed to be going to work in another port from her parents' home in the countryside in the spring of the 28th year of the Republic of China. She has not returned for seven years and there is no news of her. I have repeatedly asked people to inquire with her parents, but they all shirk responsibility and do not know, and there is no satisfactory answer. I have decided to divorce her. Where should I appeal? What legal procedures should I go through? Please advise.</p>
<p>Lawyer Zhu Yakui replied Anyone who has been missing for more than three years may request a divorce. You can sue with the local court or the local county government that also handles judicial matters.</p>
<p>Li Zhenyu asked I lent a friend 2,000 yuan (counterfeit money) in the 29th year of the Republic of China, stating that the annual interest rate was two points. Later, because I repeatedly urged him to pay back the money, he only paid the interest. He only returned the money in the 34th year. If the price of goods in the 29th year is compared with the price of goods in the 34th year, then I obviously suffered too much loss. However, because the counterfeit court at that time did not have the precedent of compensating according to the price ratio, I had to endure the pain and accept it. Now there are two questions: (1) I don't know if there is any current law that uses the price (or cost of living) as the ratio of compensation? (2) I have already received the original amount of the loan. I don't know if I can apply for compensation according to the ratio?</p>
<p>Lawyer Zhu Yakui replied Since you have already received the principal and interest, you cannot raise objections now.</p>
