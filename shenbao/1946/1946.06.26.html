<p>〔本報瀋陽廿五日電〕蔣經國氏在此和戰即將揚曉之緊張空氣中，突然飛來東北，頗惹人注目。蔣氏輕裝簡從，僅偕秘書陳元楚崧秋二人同來，廿四日午後到瀋後，即分訪此間軍政負責人，夜間曾與十數訪晤者談話，對記者不願接見與多談。廿五日晨，即急飛長春。據聞蔣氏不擬在東北多事勾留，或將由長再北去，是否前往蘇聯，則不得而知。</p>

<p>〔本報南京廿五日電〕關係民族榮枯，國家盛衰，經濟安危之整編統編軍隊間題，軍事三人會議決於明晨鄭重舉行，閘此項整軍之中心議題，包括整軍比例，其軍駐區兩大間題，如會議進行順利，即進而商討有關整軍實施之各項具體辦汰，如撤移鐵道沿綫各地及沿海各港口（包括烟台威海衛）共軍之實行程序，及日期望統編後共軍之編制與給養。聞參加整軍間題談判之政府代表，原擬由陳誠參謀總長偕同徐永昌將軍出席，現因陳氏健康尚未完全恢復，仍由徐永昌將軍出席會議。徐氏連日檢閱地圖，並偕同國防部參謀總部高級幕僚躬親整理有關國內整軍實施後之各項報吿，當夜以繼日工作，極爲緊張。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山二十五日廣播：據南京來電，中國共產黨領袖毛澤東，指責美國威脅中國之和平與安全一事，已在此間馬使行館中引起嚴重憂慮。馬使對於此事，不願有所表示，但美方某發言人認爲毛氏之聲明，純屬宣傳性質，共產黨主席之指責美國，顯示該黨已恢復其反美宣傳，對於和平談判，勢將發生嚴重影響。美方另一消息靈通人士云：毛氏對於美國軍事援華法案，攻擊尤烈，但實際上此項法案，目的在協助國共雙方。渠指出美國軍官約一百人，已留京兩月，以待軍寧衝突停止之後，前往張家口，設立共軍軍官學校，苟國共雙方均能信守協定，則同樣可獲得美國之援助，而使中國不致陷入經濟上之混亂狀態。</p>

<p>〔中央社南京廿五日電〕國防部發言人廿五日談話解：日來外間謠傳我海軍砲擊烟台威海衛兩地，該項消息來源，係由中共新華社以萊陽廿日電所捏造，意圖中傷淆亂聽聞，共產軍爲企圖襲佔靑島，除本月上旬即以陸上部隊，向靑島外圍逐步進迫外，十六日晚復以帆船九十隻，由薛家島黃島方面，向團島進襲，意圖策應陸上部隊，當經我駐靑海軍艦隊，爲維持海上治安，曾派小型艦隻，在長山羣島一帶巡弋，此爲海軍平時應有之任務，中共新華社即籍以捏造謠言，如稱我海軍砲轟烟台威海衛等情，殊屬無稽。</p>

<p>〔本報南京二十五日電〕糧食部徐堪部長，今對記者分析糧價高漲之原因，及田賦微實等問題，據稱：自去年勝利後，軍糧部分停徽所缺少之軍糧一千四百萬石，不得不向市塲收購，致予米商以抬高糧價機會。反觀田賦徵實之四川。貴州等後方各省糧價，則較穩定。本月初，財政收支會議決定田賦微實延長一年辦法，雖明知田賦微實爲落伍之制度，同時亦深悉八年抗戰予人民之創鉅痛深，然政府實有不得已之苦衷。蓋現今整軍復員尚未完成，仍需巨額軍糧，以賣補給，若田賦不徽實，軍糧仍出以收購方式，則勢將加深惡性通貨膨脹之危機，物價將不知高漲至如何程度，故田賦徵實，實爲戰後物價未穩定前之緊急措施。一俟今後經濟步入正軌，物價穩定後，仍當恢復徵值。至對各省徵實徵借額之分配，則須詳細調查各省受災情形生產狀况，以期公允。</p>

<p>中委陳果夫先生，旬日前來滬，在中央政校同學會歡迎席上，大聲疾呼地說道：「上海這個地方，是太危險了！你們要小心，別給人家吃掉和拐掉！」這句話，眞是算得對於許多上海人的一個緊急警報，值得我們每一個人的警惕和提防。</p>
<p>上海在表面上雖然沒有豺狼虎豹，但吃人的東西，仔細屈指一算，實在是太多了。跳舞塲，酒排間，和秘密的賭塲淫窟，以及託名娛樂的變相陷阱，誨盜誨淫，無一不是吃人的巨獸。野獸從深山裏衝下來吃人，人知道怎樣地抵抗它們，怎樣來保護自己。可是一個人給上海的嫖賭荒唐的巨獸吃掉，他們都是情情願願把自己送入它們的口中，一些也沒有抵抗，一些也沒有戒懼。從每天下午起，上海不知有多少淫窟賭窟舞窟，在里首路口，張開着血盆大口，來抓住人們大嚼。每天更不知有多少人，給它們吃得皮骨俱無，而至死不悟。</p>
<p>最危險的，可算是初從內地來的人了。敵人八年殘酷的封銷，使他們的日常生活陷於難以形容的十分艱苦的境地，一旦跑到目迷五色的上海來，而又值勝利冲昏了頭腦，自然不免使其中若干修養工夫膚淺的人，立刻使他們心靈上澈底的崩潰下來。亮晶晶的黃金，巍峨高大的洋房，流錢飛馳的汽車，漂亮美麗的女人，一疊又一疊的美鈔，以及珠翠鑽玉之類，都張着巨口，等候吞噬他們。從日寇去年八月投降以來的十個月中，或暗或明，其中給黃金洋房汽車女人美金鑽石等等所吃掉者，真不知多少。降至最近，甚至白米也跳起來吃人，轟動一時的糧貸舞弊案，就是其中顯著的一例。</p>
<p>上海眞是吃人的上海，陳果夫先生的警吿，是值得我們接受的。</p>
<p>本來上海也是拐子相當多的地方。家裏的小孩，做父母的一個不小心，就要給拐匪拐掉。上海現在雖還沒有聽到像北平一樣的「拍花黨」，但女孩子給拐匪賣入妓院或給人誘惑墮落的更多。這種事，久居於上海的市民，知之最爲熟稔，而前些時幾個女學生被誘到外埠去，又曾傳爲奇談。</p>
<p>所不同的，上海的拐子，現在不是專拐小孩，而是還要拐大人。他們不但要拐去人家的肉體，還要拐掉人家的靈魂。被拐的人，儘管身體還在自己的家中或校裏，從外表看來，也有自由的行動，有獨立的生活，而實際上他的靈魂，他的思想，在不知不覺之中，久已給人家拐去。陳元盛原是一個很普通的銀行職員，爲什麼要盜竊許多黃金和美鈔而逃亡？又如此次上海有幾位老商人，爲什麼也會夾在自稱人民代表者的中間，趕到南京去趁熱鬧？這分明都顯出他們的靈魂早在自己不知不覺間給人家拐去，因而他們的行動也身不由主的只好服從拐他去的人的命令了。</p>
<p>如上所論，上海在物質方面，固然極度繁華，極度使人可以獲得美足的享受，同時却又是萬分危險最易使人墮落的地方。上海在精神方面，固然因爲受了外來的刺激，易於使人振奮，同時却又是各種主張，標新立異，很容易叫人目炫心迷，中風狂走。</p>
<p>因此我們希望上海人在物質享受方面，要研究老子的淡泊，孔子的固窮。這些誠是中國數千年的陳言，或不足以配合今天的世界，不過假使我們有了這種修養，至少可使我們見洋房汽車不搶，黃金美鈔不要。一切人家看作爲了不起的東西，我們把它們視作敝屣和糞土。這是迂腐嗎？愚蠢嗎？絕對不是。當人家東窗事發，身繫囹圄，受鞫於法庭，一轉瞬間，身敗名裂，生命朝不保暮之時，我們依然享有完全自得之樂。那决非給物質引誘吃掉和拐掉的聰明人所可同日而語。</p>
<p>同時，我們又希望上海人在精神方面。儘管常與外國朋友往來，而修身齊家治國平天下的道理，應該知道中國還是有我們傳統的精義，不必舍近求遠，徒亂心目。老實講，戰後的世界，必須使英美的民主主義，與蘇聯的社會主義漸近，趨於大同，而後世界和平可保。現在的英國工黨，正想試走這一條路。我們應該慶幸，我們的三民主義真正實行起來，就是開闢這一條路。我們在政治上要用民權主義擷取英美民主政治之長，在經濟上要用民生主義收穫蘇聯社會主義之果。換句話說，我們不必再採取蘇聯一黨專政的獨裁政治，也不能再學步英美往日資本主義的經濟制度。我們在精神上如果能堅貞的守住這個信念，自然不會人云亦云地被拐去做資本主義的尾閭或共產專政的祭品。</p>
<p>人生如白駒過隙，富貴榮華，一切如夢。我們大家要乘一息尚存之際，努力爲國家民族的利益，盡一些力量。切莫隨波逐流，趨奇好異，循致魂馳魄散，志變神移，終於給無形的猛獸拐子吃掉拐掉。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦二十五日廣播：今日四强外長開會，討論彼此不能同意之各點。同時，蘇外長莫洛托夫突然自動訪晤員爾納斯，因此，巴黎和會之希望復見濃厚。聞美蘇可能獲得妥協，其折衷辦法係國際化特里埃斯特港，期限十年。</p>
<p>〔中央社巴黎廿四日合衆電〕貝爾納斯莫洛托夫本日突然會議一小時，外交界人士相信，莫氏或已接到莫斯科方面對於四國間最困難之特里埃斯特問題之訓令。莫氏在今日下午之會議中，以外交上靜坐罷工之姿態，拒絕同意關於義大利條約之任何建議，各國代表遂轉而討論對巴爾幹各納粹附庸國之條約。若千論者認爲莫洛托夫之不考慮法義邊界及義海軍處理問題，係因在特港問題解決前，渠對此諸問題不欲獲得任何協議。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎廿四日電〕外長會議本日午前午後兩次舉行會議，討論四項問題爲時甚久，即（一）義奧兩國邊界，（二）法義兩國邊界，（三）義艦隊分配辦法，（四）多瑙河航行自由，（五）最感棘手之特里埃斯特港隸屬問題。會塲空氣雖極友好，但對於各該問題均未能切實獲致協議。蘇外長莫洛托夫與美國務卿貝爾納斯曾於本日午後單獨會晤，討論第四項問題，內客未悉。關於義奧邊界問題，奧國對於義大利所提出之要求，事關邊界大加修正，幷非微小問題，已爲四國外長所拒絕。關於奧國股斯勃魯克與林茲兩城間之鐵路交通，四國外長則認爲應予以便利之保證，業已移付專家委員會討論。關於法義邊界問題，法對義提出五項要求，外長會議已接受其四，（一）聖貝爾奈特山隘，（二）蒙特塞尼斯山隘，（三）蒙特泰波爾及夏倍爾頓區，（四）蒂尼河及弗蘇比河山谷地，以上各地均劃歸法國。關於義艦隊分配問題，法專家對於義國保留軍艦之比率，已提出一項折衷案，蘇外長當即表示同意，本可在原則上成立協議，卒因英美對於莫洛托夫所提出之附件，拒不同意，未能成立協議，但修正案之門戶仍然開啓。關於多瑙河自由航行問題，四國外長雖在原則上一致同意，但蘇外長又主張關於此事一切建議，應由多瑙河沿岸各國提付討論，美英仍復堅持原議，要求將此事列入對羅媾和條約內。</p>

<p>〔聯合社紐約二十四日電〕聯合國安全理事會今日以七票對四票，否決波蘭要求立即與西班牙弗朗哥政府斷絕外交關係案，此案係波蘭代表闌琪於四月十九日提出（一）今日表決時，蘇聯·法國及墨西哥代表舉手贊成。中國代表郭泰祺首先表示反對，中國爲五大國之一，具有否決權，故中國一國即足以推翻該案。惟郭氏並未聲明行使否決權，附議反對者爲美·英·澳·加及巴西等國。波蘭代表於表決後，復提議安理會議程仍保留此一問題，俾在九月一日聯合國大會開會前重加討論。會議旋決定由澳洲·波蘭及英國代表組成三人委員會，草擬西班牙問題之適當報告。安理會本日於討論西班牙問題之前，曾通過一新規則，准理事會主席於者慮有關其所代表國家問題時，暫時退出主席地位。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦廿五日廣播：英代表團在印工作已完全失敗，定明日發表聲明，兩三日內離印返團。回敎聯盟領袖眞納今日曾與印督及英代表團會談，內容未詳。</p>
<p>〔路透社新德里廿四日電〕國大黨執委會今日下午以簡函一件，呈達印督魏菲爾，申明拒絕設立臨時政府之建議，詳細之理由，當於明日提出，此項僵局，並無不能打破之望，蓋國大黨若能接受英內閣之遠期計劃，則設立臨時政府之問題，猶不妨從頭論起也。國大黨主席尼赫魯今日曾晤克里浦斯，談及關於遠期計劃之問題，甘地亦定今夜晤內閣代表團。國大黨執委會將於星期四再開會，届時就英方之遠期計劃或可有所決議。回敎同盟前已表示接受英方之遠期計劃，今日該同盟執委會復開會九十分鐘，討論臨時政府之議，亦尚未有決定。又印度敎徒正宗組織馬哈莎勃哈，於國大黨宣布其決議後，亦將開會討論應取步驟。</p>
<p>〔路透社新德里廿四日電〕一般認爲國大黨對英代表所提遠期計劃，未肯遽即表示接受，係因孟加拉政府發表流通信，宣佈提出候選人之程序，國大黨認爲此舉意在使競選人接受分省制度，英內閣大臣正就此事解釋中。</p>

<p>建國機械農墾公司之創設，旨在輔助政府對於農業工業化推行，至於推行之方式：（一）機械化，採取逐步推廣利用機械代替人力之耕種。（二）集體經營，在毗通之農村，共同利用一部機械耕種，俾貧苦農民，得有利用機械之機會。推行地區擬以太湖流域洞庭湖流域及蘇北一帶爲最初目標，其中以蘇北爲主。並擬選擇上海附近某地爲實騐示範區。機械方面，自犁泥至收穫包括五部不同機械爲一套，每套機械價值，目前約合美五千元，預計五套機械可以耕種一萬畝田地，以蘇北爲例，可耕之地約一千餘萬畝，即需機械五千餘套。就目前情形而論，我國一般農村之經濟力量，以及巨量機械之訂製，困難殊多，是以中國農業工業化之完成，最低限度尚須五年以上乃至十年之時間。徐氏表示：渠擬在今後三十年期間，用以從事農業工業化之工作。</p>

<p>— 朱家驊</p>
<p>勝利以來，敎育部的工作，多半是復負與善後的工作。依據去年九月在重慶舉行的全國敎員復員善後會議的決議各案，敎育部要很快的使西遷的學校及文化機關爲合理分佈的遷回。要使收復區的學校復興，要根除奴化性的敎育，要謀靑年學子各得讀書之所。這些工作自然築難萬分，而問題亦重重。</p>
<p>（一）學生就學問題：抗戰八年來，敎育事業在面的發展上是進步多了，學生的數量也大爲增加。戰前專科以上學校學生四萬一千餘人，現在幾增加了一倍；戰前中學生六十二萬餘人，現在有一百一十六萬餘人，收復區的學生尚未計算在內；戰前小學生一千八百萬人，現在後方十九省市就有二十五百萬人。今後學生的數量勢必大大增加。我們普遍推行國民敎育，隨着地方自治的進步，小學中學即更日形發達。姑就專科以上學校來說，勝利以來我們連東北辦了六個臨時大學補習班，收容了敵僞時期專科以上學校學生一萬三千餘人，暑假以後，他們分別入正式廠學校；靑年軍原係專科以上學校的學生，和原來高中三年級的學生，退伍後必須復學，在萬人以上；暑期中各專科學校各大學招生亦約計萬人。總計今年專科大學新生至少三萬數千人，原有近八萬學生，學校已有容納不下的現象，目下即將增加數萬，高物價限制了學校設備，其困難自可想像，敎育部和敎育界司人正在多方設法，克服這種困難、</p>
<p>（二）師資問題：在學生數量突增的時際，敎師益惑缺乏，後方十九省市六十六萬小學敎師，其中受過師範學校訓練及檢定合格者，只佔百分之四十，中等學校師資合格者也不到半數，雖然在都市裏尋求敎授工作者不少，但這只是一時的畸形現象，在廣大的鄉村裏或僞僻的省份，師資是很缺乏的。因爲如此，所以我們每年舉行師範敎育運動，最近計劃五年中增加師範生五十萬人，藉圍解救小學教育的師資荒。我們並變更了大學師範學院的　　，所有文理工農學院的學生，有志終身從事敎育事業者都可以　　於師範學院，受師資專業訓練亦得受師範生的待遇，藉謀增多中等學校的師資。至於大學師資的造就涉及專門學問和高深研究非一蹴可成，此刻不貿然添設許多大學，師資難求，也是原因之一。我們現在只恢復了北洋大學，山東大學，安徽大學，並剏辦了蘭州大學，在本年也只擬議籌設一個外國語文的專科學校，以適應國際性工作人材的需求，此事外交部極為贊同。</p>
<p>因爲大學及專科學校師資缺乏，所以敎育部鼓勵學業完畢的留學生歸國，酌情救濟他們的生活，補助他們的旅費，希望他們早點回來，爲國內敎育服務。</p>
<p>目前敎師待遇微薄，也是師資减少原因之一。自然要把教育人員的待遇單獨提高，是難以辦到的事，但是我們盡力注意敎師的福利。大學敎授除薪津外，每人有學術研究費二萬五千元，現擬設法增加一倍，已專案呈請行政院，希望能邀核准。中學敎師的待遇，各省情形不一，敎育部所規定的是高中敎員月薪最高額三百元，（即底薪）初中敎員月薪二百二十元，其他一切津貼按照各地標準發給，這樣標準是較戰前爲高。小學敎師的待遇，各地情形更不一致，敎育部規定以就當地個人衣食住三者所需生活費之三倍爲標準，希望各地能够切實做到。總括的說，敎師待遇不足以維持生活，是最焦灼的事，過去敎師因此轉業者甚多，我們要怎樣設法不再繼續有此現象，而使敎師們安心講學。</p>
<p>（三）留學問題：無論培養師資和供應國家建設的需要，留學敎育必須繼續辦理。何况戰從國際變化甚大，學術進步驚人，我們更要進一步瞭解歐美。青年學子出國深造，極有必要。故留學計劃應有改進，而留學政策必須繼續。本年舉辦的公費生留學考試，人數不多，政府公費生只有一百二十名，此外有七十名是法國與我國的交換學生，另有中英文敎基金董事會的公費生。留學學　　科，　　　　　　　　　備的人材，留學考試，正在報名　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　，不久亦將開　敎育　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　經費與　際需要相差甚遠。中央的敎育復負經費列了六百億，不能不算多，可是五百幾十個單位分配下來，每個單位所得仍然不够。例如中央大學在戰前有學生一千二百人，現有近五千人，校舍不敷甚鉅，原有校舍又破擴待修理，學校設備須增加，這筆費用就着實可觀。浙江大學戰前學生不到八百人，現在二千餘人，而校舍非但不够，並且戰了五分之三，淸華大學南開大學房屋毀得很多，其他各校的情形，大致相同，拿去年九月所定的復員經費包括搬運修建川旅等費，在現在物價漲了許多來用，更感不敷了。收復區各省市的敎育復員經費，去年分發了行政院所撥的緊急措施費十二億二千五百萬元，今年核准在各省復員費內劃出六十六億作爲敎育復員之用，有的省份得着十一二億，有的三四億，以此經費來恢復敵人所摧毀了的學校敎育機關，實在不够，敎育部曾經要各省市在敵人投降後一年內將敎育業務全部恢復，因爲經費困難，恐難達到預期進度。</p>
<p>學校的設備，行政院善後救濟總署允以四百萬美金數，來補充農工醫科的需要，正在洽商購置，戰時敎育部訂購的一百萬美金圖書儀器，和敎育部近萊在英美捐得的書刋約二三十萬册，現正開始陸續到達；各省設立的科學儀器製造所，製造中學的科學儀器，本年亦酌予補助，俾增加出品。最普運而最迫切的，是學校課堂桌椅和學生床舖的設備，有的省份學校上課快一年，連桌椅床板都不齊全，學生站着聰課，睡地板，像這類實際情形，當然影響了敎育的效率，必須趕緊補救，要在最短期內把學校最低限度的設備完成。</p>
<p>除了以上四個問題，敎育部力求解決及加緊工作之外，他如各級學校課程的改善，敎育部早已着手集合專家研討，準備修訂。學校的行政，須有軌道而期嚴密，慎重校長的人選。如何鼓勵私人辦學，亦在積極籌　。總之敎育在目前，是百廣待舉，敎育的復興，是在維持現狀中以改進現狀，而人力物力與智力則多有未　，敬請各位同志及我敎育文化界同人多專寳貴的意見來發揚我　百年的大計。（卅五年六月廿四日在國民政府中央紀念週報告）</p>

<p>本報廿二日揚州訊　特約記者王公瀚</p>
<p>自從消息傳來，國府令派社會部部長谷正　氏主持蘇北難民救濟事宜以來，揚邑一般民衆先就有這麼個簡單的感覺：中央畢竟沒有忘懷蘇北！這是一種精神的反映。而這精神反映的由來，向大處說，是因爲勝利後的國內大勢，一直叫人們大傷腦筋的；向更大處說，國聯方面歷次的「安全」「和平」會議，始終爲不幸的暗影所籠罩，人們總担心恐懼着「世界第三次大戰」，似乎有　然爆發的一天。人們不是抗戰八年前的頭腦了，對于國際局勢的認識力，分析力，以及這方面的警覺性，各方面都有進步了。向小處說，揚州牛年多以來的環境，一直是外弛內張，風風雨雨，覺得人心不安。米價又和各地一樣，一度竟突破過六萬大關。</p>
<p>幾場及時雨　新麥已登場</p>
<p>所幸前兩個星期裏，接連落了幾塲及時雨，新麥又已登塲，再加上滬市與市長斷然抑平米價，多少給此問也有點影響。（揚邑各物物價是盲目地跟住上海跑的）駁近這裏的米價得以回退五萬關了。</p>
<p>人們在失意巾得了點小安慰，谷部長又眞的來到揚州了，幷撥了賬款一億元，麵粉二十三萬袋來揚，人們不禁大爲快意。</p>
<p>蘇北各縣流亡在揚的難胞，雖然對谷部長此次所撥與揚州的賬款數字，不完全愜意，因爲照谷部長宣佈的賬款支用的原則及辦法，須充作改善難民招待所，（如修理房屋門窗等）及辦理平民食堂，小本貸款，難民醫療機關等，如此一來，能分配給各個難胞的實際數字，可以想像是寥廖無幾了。不過，難民們也理解而信任：「政府的力量，目前只能辦到如此」。况且正如谷部長說的好：「區區物質，自屬無濟於事，但俗諺，千里送鵝毛，禮輕人意重。」</p>
<p>谷部長撫慰　難民齊流涙</p>
<p>因此難胞們對於中央的沒有忘懷，他們的恩情，總歸是感激涕零的。這表現在行爲方面的便是：見了谷部長匍匐痛哭。「議經院」裏的難民，十九日上午，當谷部長前去察看撫慰時，全體便哭了起來，另一處難民收容所，當谷部長前去察看撫慰時，有寳應難民郭汝成者，金陵大學畢業生，見到了谷部長，翻身便拜，一面訴說苦情：日昨賣出單小掛一件，才挨過了一天的生活。這些鏡頭。使同往參觀的人，眼睫上不禁都沾濕了。</p>
<p>三歲男孩子　五十萬出售</p>
<p>就在這一天晚上，我從外面剛回到屋裏，妻子指向正在午睡未了的我們的第三個孩子向我笑着說：「一個三歲的孩子，外面有人能將五十萬的代價肯賣掉呢，你捨得賣嗎？」接着，她吿訴我上海有業銀行者派人到揚州來賣一個三歲的男孩子，結果，某隊貧難胞以五十萬的代價，將三歲的孩子賣了出去。我聽完了妻子的話，看着睡態可掬的自己的孩子，深深地想到一般隱貧者的困苦。</p>
<p>在難民登記過程裏，是有隱貧者不願自動登記的現象的，因此，此間成立未久的蘇北難民救濟協會揚州辦事處，二十日上午召開座談會，第一件會談的事件便是如何設法勸導隱貧者自動登記</p>
<p>谷部長十九日來揚，廿日與蘇省府主席聯袂去泰縣視察，報載廿一日已返鎭轉滬，這等於說揚泰這一角落的難胞救濟事宜，算是已吿一段落。</p>
<p>但記者的意識裏，怎樣也也　不開此間某難民教容所內一付對聯上說的話：「白叟黃童，爲誰流浪？忍飢待哺，何日還鄉？」</p>
<h3 id="c138">比里克斯女士　從新疆來 <a href="#c138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>本報廿日南京訊　記者張明</p>
<p>即使在今天，交通暢達迅速的今天，我們對於業已開了門的新疆，仍然不能不有天外之感！新疆的面積可以和目前息息相關的東九省總面積相等，比起浙江來，要有十五個，佔我國全土的百分之一四·六九〇，計一·六四一·五五四方公里。省境內還有號稱世界屋脊的帕米爾高原的葱嶺，有相傳唐僧玄奘取經時走過的天山，還有那聚散無常的沙漠讓我們遙想，這是一個多麼足以引起人構想着什麼俠客一類的故事啊！</p>
<p>這一次，記者藉着新疆的國大代表抵京的機會，作了一次在嚮往中的訪問。</p>
<h3 id="c139">我發現了　彼此差異甚大 <a href="#c139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>他們一共來了四個人，一位是比里克斯女士，她是新疆的國大代表，一位是新疆省黨部執行委員兼民政廳副廳長華聲慕，一位是迪化市立女子中心學校校長沙德提庫士，女士還有一位是國大代表翻譯吳鐵庫爾。</p>
<p>事先我就知道我是不能和他們直接通問的，所以首先找那位翻譯，吳先生，吳先生頎長的個子，着的是西服，看樣子，沒有一點異於漢人的樣子，於是我放心的去訪問這位比里克斯女士，但是，乍一見面，我就驚異了，我和她之閒的差異太大，她有白的皮膚，有大而圓的眼睛，有美而長的辮子，還有健康結實的體格，外面穿的是西洋化的服裝，沒有一點矯揉造作的樣子。我和她顯然沒有一點相同。</p>
<p>這一次的訪問，完全基於我的好奇，新鮮，所以，我沒有問她大的問題，而且首先我就從小處問起！</p>
<h3 id="c140">談小問題　頭發旗袍衣料 <a href="#c140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>「你的頭髮，爲什麼要這麼長？」</p>
<p>「流行長髮。」</p>
<p>「有剪短髮的嗎？」</p>
<p>「沒有。」</p>
<p>「你的衣服很好看，這種式樣不全是外國式樣嗎？」</p>
<p>「無所謂外國樣子，全看着我們的流行。流行什慶樣子，就是什慶樣子，這就是現在最流行的。」</p>
<p>「你們穿旗袍嗎？」</p>
<p>「沒有。」</p>
<p>「衣料從那裏來的？」</p>
<p>大部份從蘇聯來，從前還有英國貨，現在已經沒有了，不過新疆自己可以織很好的花綢，還有出名的毛氈！」比女士說得很高興，顯出相當驕傲。</p>
<h3 id="c141">婚姻制度　完全依據教條 <a href="#c141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>接着我問到婚姻制度。她回答記者說：</p>
<p>「我們的婚姻是依據敎條的，也就是不能和異敎人結合，至於其他的習俗，現在也比較自由了，照禮說，女子是不能隨便出外的！」</p>
<p>這時吳先生插進來吿訴記者：「比代表是新疆省婦女會的理事呢！」</p>
<p>此女士顯然是很天眞的，她才二十二歲，可是她又很能幹，當記者聽吳先生翻譯時，她就拿着筆在一旁慢慢的寫起漢字來，我認爲這是增加我的興趣的，我問她：「你怎麼會寫？」她笑了，吳先生代她答：「因爲在省會，漢人來往的很多，她常常往返交際，也可以聽懂漢語了，說是不大方便，」字也可以勉强寫得如小學低級部的學生。她很聰明，顯然的，當記者間元這些小問題後，再問了一句：「聽說你們是不歡迎外面去的人的，是嗎？」</p>
<p>她幾乎發急了，的的咕咕說了一大堆很平板，不够抑揚音調的話，要吳先生翻譯給我聽，她說</p>
<p>「這不是我們的意見，而且也已經過去了，當盛世才主新的時候，他就像把我們監禁在監牢裏一樣，時時發佈着一種恐怖政策，獨裁，先後關閉了十二萬的優秀份子，而且他沒收一般人的財產，所有一切政治經濟都在他的高壓之中，尤其到了最後一兩年內，更實行了同化和通婚的政策，冀圖消滅我新疆的民族，就在那時，他不歡迎外面去的人，因爲他的殘酷，還是不願意別的人知道，所以凡有人去，他就要加以危害，以杜絕宣揚」。</p>
<p>接着，她再說：</p>
<p>「我們是沒有權力來拒絕任何人不到新疆來的」。</p>
<h3 id="c142">伊寧事件　始給他們以苦痛 <a href="#c142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>下面她告訴我伊寗事件的發生，給予了他們多少大的痛苦，她接着說：</p>
<p>「現在張主席是很好的，他來了，能够使伊寧事件和平解決，我們感謝張主席的博愛精神，他是偉大的。」</p>
<p>從這樣，我們知道，在不同的信仰裏，我們是不能勉强他們的任何一搬行爲的。</p>
<p>我看她說得太緊張，太氣憤，於是　着把話題扯開了。</p>
<p>「如果我到新疆去，你歡迎嗎？」</p>
<p>「歡迎，並且希望這一次就跟着我們回去了！</p>
<p>我愛好　的天真，坐得很久才走，最後我們互約着「在新疆再見！」</p>
<h3 id="c143">沙漠駝隊　令人多少神往 <a href="#c143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>一個　　的故事，讓我揚開了，新疆，除去了因爲地理，在天然的形勢下，不得不和內地左在隔關外，其他在宗敎，和人爲的關係上，還存在了不少的隔聞，但是，在今天，這個隔閔顯然漸漸的在消滅！</p>
<p>新疆，有着七十九個縣，五百多萬的人口，百分之七十是務農，屬南疆，勢力較優，遊牧的佔百分之廿，屬北疆，其餘爲工商。</p>
<p>出產豐富，就礦產言，有金銀銅鐵鉛煤，石油，玉石，可是這些都在政府的掌握下，目前開發的計劃，還沒有逐漸實施。</p>
<p>另外，代表說：我們有像茶臺一樣大的蘋果，鮮甜的哈密瓜，各種的水果，各種蔬菜，是的，新疆是一個誘惑的名字，我們要求享受新疆！開發新疆！</p>
<p>但是新疆有嚴重的種族問題，有嚴重的宗敎問題，有嚴重的話語言問題。</p>
<p>他們的宗敎有佛敎，耶穌敎，回敎。語言有土耳其語，波斯語，蒙古語，滿語，漢語。文字有漢文，維吾兒文，滿文，蒙古文等。再說種族，通常有十四種，爲漢，滿，錫伯，索倫，蒙古，察哈爾，土耳扈特，維吾兒，哈薩克，布魯特，塔吉克，漢回，韃靼，歸化俄等。</p>
<p>其中以維吾兒人最多，佔全攝人口總數百分之七十，大牛在南置。所以我們今天說什慶種族問題，也並不是太可怕的，因爲捨維吾兒這一大族之外，就都是小的支族了。</p>
<p>我嚮往於沙漢中的駝隊，我嚮往於早熟的土耳其風的少女，我更嚮往於哈密瓜，响往於茶壼大的蘋果。</p>

<p>日本發動太平洋戰爭，暹邏淪陷，被迫參加所謂「大東亞戰爭」，向聯合國宜戰。光復後，美方大度寬容，處之泰然，並未提出任何條件。而英國的封建思想較爲濃厚，不肯放棄機利，認爲暹邏係交戰國，令其訂立停戰協定，暹方無奈，承認賠償白米三千萬噸，戰費五百萬英鎊。英僑在暹資產受戰爭損失或爲盟機炸燬著，由暹方負責賠償，或加以重建。又遇邏所產木材，須經英方批准協定，簽字之後方許出口。英軍現在尚未撤退，暹人對英國人，似極頭痛，現出無可奈何的神氣。對於華僑，則不改傳統心理，極端輕視。日本投降後，曾因細故而對我僑胞大施殺戮，引起國人公憤。嗣後派　訪華使節團來華，看到了我國的實際情形，地大物博，國防鞏固，一般人民，都風度翩翩，彬彬有禮，和在本國所見赤足裸背之苦力，相形之下，判若涇渭，這才認淸了我國的眞面目，也知道了我國的下可侮。返國後，把此行觀感一宣揚，還人對華僑，遂不若過去的蔑視。中暹邦交，亦漸靈改善的希望，不過還希望我國人士自己尊重自己的人格，不要失去了大國民風度，致爲夷族輕視。</p>

<p>編輯光生：我是一個軍人。十幾歲即參加部隊。抗戰八年，以血汗換得了勝利，我也搏得下級帶兵官。主席諄諄訓導：「建國工作勝於抗戰，要拿出抗戰的精神，完成建國大業。」不錯，我們雖處於勝利後，仍是席不暇溫，在週旋着保護八年中水深火熱的同胞。這是我們的責任，我們苦死了，决不說話。可是我們的痛苦，連一個人都不知道。食的老百姓從未吃過的配給米，菜更不用談了，那樣便宜吃那樣，猪肉魚類成年沒有上過鍋。睡覺連蓆子都沒有，朝稻草裏一鑽。接收敵僞的物資，我們親眼見到，軍　很多，爲什麼不能發一條給我們呢？餉項吧，二等兵每月九百元，一等兵一千另五十元，上等兵一千二百元，他們苦苦的幹了一個月洗不了一次澡，吃不了一頓飯，，買不到一雙鞋子。老天爺！我率領着一百多個兵，他們每天赤着脚，日常生活維持不了，怎能使當兵的能安心呢？我整天對他們說，上級對我們拼過死的人，絕對會設法解决的。結果，只聽得加薪加薪，而可憐當兵的仍是那樣！以我現在是上尉級月支生補費四萬五千元，底薪一百四十倍，膳食費八千元，共計六萬四千二百八十元，（菜金燒柴在內，）生活這樣高，做套衣服要兩萬多，布鞋一萬多一雙，剃頭洗澡怎麼辦？而偏偏的禍不單行，別了十年整的雙親，月前偕未婚妻由「匪區」逃來，我東扯西拉維持一個月，現在實在沒有辦法了！天哪！急得我眞要自殺！希望畫報替我呼籲，請當局從速解决我們當兵的痛苦。宜興楊十齡上，六，十七。</p>

<p>編者：本市警察局因鑒於滬西郊區治安問題嚴重，已令請巡隊分駐滬四維持治安。該隊於數日前派分隊長奚尊漢率警士約五十人，駐防滬西，地點是在建國西路六四八號前安南人營房。據聞還要向郊區移動，以便控制郊區的治安。他們任務是偏重在夜間，每天由午後二時起，分班巡邏。赤日炎炎，走上郊外的中山路和虹橋路，確是件辛苦的事情。我看他們每當出巡回來的時候，總是汗流夾背，濕透了衣衫。他們依舊笑容滿面，帶着愉快的情緒回到營地，幷且每天上午還要來上一次馬操，精神煥發，朝氣蓬勃，令人欽敬。該隊雖然分駐不久，可是這些擾亂治安份子看見驕着高頭大馬的勇士們，不斷地換班巡邏，已不敢再肆無忌憚的出現了。我希望這些勇士們不要有始無終，切實地幹下去，更希望警局能再分駐一部份到閘北和南市的郊區去，我相信對治安問題是很有力量的。周賢隆啓。六，十八。</p>

<p>蘇北難民三百餘萬人，紛紛流亡他鄉，、迎日來滬者已達五萬餘人，現在已有人發起組織蘇北難民救濟協會上海市籌募會了，在進行這個工作之前，願代向上海各界同胞呼籲，請求慨然解囊。</p>
<p>八年來蘇北的同胞，一直在火熟水深之中，那時敵偽盤踞，原無辦法，現在抗戰勝利了，再這受此家破人亡流離載道的浩刧，蘇北同胞固感到十分憤慨，寃抑，即置身於此遭際外的我們，也同樣感到十分憤慨：原因很簡單，他們沒有任何理由遭受這痛苦，遭受這種痛苦也毫無代價可言。</p>
<p>所以，我們今日在發動大規模的緊急救濟運動之外，我們應該積極地從根本上替道批流亡在外的三百餘萬蘇北難民謀取一澈底解决，不然，我們這救濟工作將失去意義，而且不會得到圓滿的效果。</p>

<h3 id="c153">上海大學生與重慶大學生 <a href="#c153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>— 王善本</p>
<p>值今復員伊始，後方各大學都紛紛遷返京滬之際，兩地同學因不熟悉對方的底蘊，而引起不少人對將來的共處合作問題感到杞憂。從重慶回到上海後，同學朋友們都喜歡問：我對於兩地同學的意見。要對這點下一個槪括的斷語，實在不是容易。在重慶時曾聽說（只是聽說）交大同學到了上海以後就有重慶與上海之別，顯劃出一道不可填沒鴻溝。實質上，這兩地的同學的確各有其特質，但這種不同點並非不可克復的，只要我們透澈了解這區異的所在。今就我個人觀察所及，將其歧異點臚列于后：</p>
<p>（一）學齡的大小——重慶的同學多來自四方，或由戰區跋山涉川，或由他方輾轉逃難而來，多把學業躭擱，有的高中卒業後，又無力升學，於是在進入大學以前，先在外服務數年者亦大有人在。因是之故，重慶大學生的一般學齡，較上海爲高，普通進大學的平均學齡，大槪在二十以上；而上海則以十八九歲爲最普通，甚至十六七歲者也不乏其人。就我個八來說，以前在上海時，同學的學齡中，我算是中上的人，可是在重慶，我們同寢室十一人中（同寢室多係同班）却以我的年齡爲最小，其最大者與我相差五六歲之巨。</p>
<p>（二）環境的優劣——在上海唸大學，多少帶有一些奢侈性，普通赤貧之家的子弟不敢存此奢望，所以上海的大學生都是過着較優適的生活；反之，重慶的大學生什九都是鄉井遠離，接濟無着，仰仗着公費貸金過活的。</p>
<p>（三）政治感觀的銳鈍——重慶是政治的中心，舉凡世界的動靜，國內的進退，莫不瞭若掌指。尤其各黨各派各種色彩的報章雜誌，充斥蠭集，這種環境之下，關心國事的大學生們得藉以作觀察，分析，比較，綜合而對政治局勢有較清切的認識。</p>
<p>反之，上海以往被控制於敵偽的鐵蹄下，大學的生命都在虎視眈眈之下苟延殘喘，很難有政治活動，連較正確一些的報道亦不易得，所以風氣自然不同些。</p>
<p>基於以上三異點，我們所得的斷語是這樣：</p>
<p>重慶的大學生除四川土著外，多是從死亡的邊緣中掙扎出來的，他們年齡較大，較懂得知識的寳貴，世情的炎凉，因爲是苦學，自然比較肯下死勁。去年七月復旦大學渡舟傾覆，有三同學慘遭沒頂，他們都是有著作的，而尤以其中外文系的一同學，其已發表與未發表的著作和翻譯共有百餘萬字之多。大學二年的苦功，竟能有如此之成績，即使是粗製濫造，其勤勞之情形，亦可想而至。他們因爲經濟多很拮据，平常都很少出門，對於衣着，只求溫體，毫無奢望，因此很能安謐寗靜，孜孜攻讀。</p>
<p>但是他們對政治的感應，却沒有這樣的沉默，往往一個學校就可代表一個社會機構，打着各色各樣的旗幟，呌着各黨各派的口號，互相抨擊，互相謾駡。他們對政治認識較淸是一個長處，但是少數拗執的不良份子趁機作亂，煽動滋事，破壞學府應有的融洽，未嘗不是一極大憾　。</p>
<p>至於上海，環境惡劣，市俗的囂塵，靑年學子們處境在這溫罄繁麗的搖籃裏，孰能無動於中，於是在唸書方面，自不免有所分心。</p>
<p>上海大學生的一大優點也就是重慶大學生的短處，即後者老於世故，往往過多虛僞做作；而前者却因年事較輕，熱情充沛，肯辦事，肯犧牲。但是上海同學的考究修飾，力求浮華虛榮，實爲求學途徑上一大障礙。</p>
<p>最後，我認爲兩地的大學生各有其長短，只要能够互相忍讓，力求了解，在相處時各捨其短，而取其長，則快樂交洽的空氣，自不難造成。</p>

<p>— 張榮邦</p>
<p>在炎熱的夏天，悶熱的時候，誰都願意往那凉爽避暑勝地去了。如上海市的黃浦公園，中正公園，虹口公園等都擠滿了，熙熙攘攘來往的遊客。道些人兒去的目的，無非是想呼吸些新鮮空氣，乘乘凉，來抖擻振作精神罷</p>
<p>至於葉家花園，牠離城不過幾里許，若是坐上汽車去的話，不到一刻鐘，便可蒞臨這「夏日樂園」了。當然，我已經去遊了一次。你問我的印象嗎？好，我說一點罷。</p>
<p>一對對的情人，手挽着手，在那花草叢中，談情說愛；你只要看他們依依不捨的神情，便可印了。</p>
<p>如花如玉的「妙齡女郎」坐在那池邊學垂釣，如果她們看見別人釣得了大魚，心中歡喜得着慌！</p>
<p>池中的魚很多，時在水面游來游去，有武裝同志，開槍向池中射擊，擊中的，大約有一斤的重量。若是有人把牠拾起來，拿回家去，倒還可以飽餐一頓！</p>
<p>池水很深，惜乎水是「死水」，太髒了！否則還可以來一下游泳，因爲上海市，還沒有這樣大的游泳池哩。我想：將來能改成流動式的「池水」，那嗎，便會使這花園增加一些生氣！</p>
<p>如果有人組織『夏令營」，「暑期補習理」，「讀書會」，我以爲很可以在此地設立。因爲這兒有淸脆的鳥聲，繁茂的樹林，鮮艷的野花。這可能陶冶你的性情。陶淵明甚愛花草樹木，就是這個道理，現代的人「節取」他這一點學一下也好。</p>
<p>油綠綠的嫩草，在平地上茁壯的長着，被那微風吹動，像一塊大綠毯，倒惹悶倦的人兒，欲躺下一睡。</p>
<p>「布榖」鳥在柏樹枝上呼叫，這好似牠專門等待「歡迎」與「歡送」，—遊客一樣。這點綴了園內的熱鬧！</p>
<p>園內有好幾個「凉亭」幾座「假山」，幾個人工『地洞」這些『地洞』確好像戰時『重慶』的『防空洞』，洞中冷颼颼的確有點涼意！</p>
<p>不過缺點不是沒有，園內有些地方很狼藉，沒有人多去修飾打掃，似不如城市的公園那樣整潔，漂亮。有幾個凉亭，且已經在頽擾了！</p>
<p>聽說這花園是故中央委員，葉楚傖先生修建的。他畢生效忠黨國，而爲國積勞病死，實深可惜！他死了！我們希望社會碩彥，捐欵把這『風景可佳」的花園，重修整飾起來！—一面可以作爲紀念他。一面好使遠道的遊各，來此觀光欣賞—這『夏日的聖地」！</p>

<p>從前聽到過一個故事：「一隻滿載糧食的船，浮海而去，因爲忘帶了火種，無以舉炊，終致全船餓死。」近據阿根廷電訊說：阿國原可有更多之糧食輸出，然以燃料缺乏，更以車胎奇缺運轍不便，故不得不焚燬糧食，以代燃料。由此可知世界上任何寶貴的東西，到了不能發生作用或無可利用時，也就分</p>

<p>潘三省在敵偽時代，跑跑總會賭塲，做做足球隊後臺老闆，生活過得相當精彩。同時他還擁有一幢高樓大厦，更是精彩生活中最精彩的一部份。這所巨厦就是鼎鼎大名的巨潑賴斯路二〇一號，常話簿寫着潘興的化名。提起這座大厦，經過潘三省三番四次的整修以後，內部眞的是美奐美輪，精彩萬分，其中舞池戲台色色俱備，足可容納二三百人，而猶有餘地，全厦需要電話七隻，以維持迎絡，經常更需要「僕歐」二十人，管理各處房屋，在當時上海私宅中，共規模之宏大與佈置之富麗，可說是無出其右。勝利之後，三省就捕，於是他的這份逆產，亦就成了大家最感興趣的事情。前次一度傳說有將該幢巨厦撥作馬歇爾行館之說，後因馬使無暇來滬久住，於是又輾轉而變作他用。當今大家惶惶不安，整日價大鬧房荒聲中，如果我們眞能准照　蔣主席手訂的解決房荒原則，每人限住一百平方公尺的話，那末你我之輩，都有資格在裏面佔一席之地。其實上海房荒，決不如小百姓理想中的那樣嚴重，上海灘上類此大厦，又何止一所，所以歸根結底說來，問題在於來上海的機關太多，官塲人物太多，於是你亦一幢我亦一幢的，永逮沒有足够分配的一天，甚至阿毛的爺拿了一幢，阿毛的娘的兄弟亦弄去了一幢。一些遠在萬里以外做官的亦來上海弄上幾幢行館，僅僅留着一二個「老家人」看看門，於是在此情形之下，你我小百姓祗好睡睡鴿子籠，　　馬路邊了。</p>

<h3 id="c161">原子彈　首次降落海面 <a href="#c161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>— 家南</p>
<p>七月初，全世界的注意力，將集中於太平洋中一羣荒僻的小島，美國海陸軍聯合舉辦的原子彈試驗，就將在那裏驚天動地地展開。</p>
<p>美國原子彈試驗指揮官第一聯合特種部隊司令蘭第海軍中將（請參閱右方銅圖），曾就此事寫了一篇文章，發表在六月八日的「柯里亞」週刊上，對於美國準備原子彈試騐的工作，除了有關國防機密的部份以外，說明得很詳細，現在把其中的要點，節譯在後面。</p>
<p>美國計劃舉行原子彈試騐三次。第一個原子彈將投在空中，在離水面數百尺處爆炸，下面是一個包括各種各樣艦艇的編隊。科學家們預料爆炸的力量一定和在長崎發揮的一般猛烈，但是結果如何，沒有人能夠預料得到，試驗的目的，也就在此。七月初舉行的一次，還不過是第一次。</p>
<p>此後還要舉行二次，日期尙未定奪。在第二次試騐中，將使一個原子彈在一個艦艇編隊的中央稍稍在水面的下邊爆炸，預料當時掀起的浪潮，將達一百尺高，產生時速一千里的暴風，而熱度則須以數萬萬度計算。我們也希望知道各種艦艇在此種情形之下，將蒙受怎樣的影響。</p>
<p>在水中爆炸　影響地球巨大</p>
<p>在第三次試騐中，將使一個原子彈在艦艇之下半英里的海洋深處爆炸。截止目前，我們對於原子彈在海洋深處炸裂的情形，可以設是一無所知，結果如何，簡直毫無把握。試驗的目的，是在探索爆炸對於試騐區內的潛水艇以及其他船隻所發生的影響。但是值得考慮的一點，就是原子彈在水中爆炸，可能使海水發生不斷的連鎖反應，或者感受放射性作用。世界上確有許多人在憂慮海水無限制的連鎖反懲，可能把整個地球炸為灰燼。但是科學專家以為不致如此。</p>
<p>在這幾次試騐的結果確定之後，我們就可以更進一步知道在將來製造軍艦的時候，應該在防禦方面如何求其改進，而對原子彈的威力可以有恃無恐。我們也可以知道原子彈對於空中的飛機，以至坦克，大砲和其他軍事配備發生怎樣的影響，進而予以適當的保護。</p>
<p>為了舉行原子彈試騐，必須選擇一個適當的地點。這個地點，應該在美國統治範圍之內，離開大陸至少要有五百里，同時地形，氣候以及風向，必須符合試騐的條件。我們曾經在大西洋，加勒比安海和太平洋海中找了幾十個地點，結果却為了水太淺，人太多，或者氣候不可靠而落選。最後還是選中了馬紹爾羣島中的比基尼珊瑚島嶼。</p>
<p>比基尼島長約二十一里，闊約十一里．周圍的許多小珊瑚島，分佈得彷彿像一條項鍊，中間是一片蔚藍色的海水。島上的居民僅有一百六十餘人，同時為了感激美軍把他們從日軍的暴政中解放出來，自願遷離該島，而到東方一百三十五里的隆基里克島去。此外，比基尼島方面的氣候和風向，也是比較少變化的。</p>
<p>七十艘戰艦　為試驗而犧牲</p>
<p>在這次試騐中準備犧牲的艦艇，共有七十艘之多，舉凡戰艦，航母，驅逐艦，潛艇，巡洋艦，登陸艇，運輪艦，各種各樣的船隻，無不具備。同時，為了試騐原子彈對於德日兩國軍艦的威力如何，德國的重巡洋艦「友琴親王」號，和日本的無畏艦「長門」號也包括在內。在艦艇的甲板上，還將安放飛機，坦克，卡車，迫擊砲，吉普車，自動砲活動雷達和無綫電設備，以便測驗原子彈對放陸軍和陸戰隊的武器，究竟能夠破壞到什麼程度。船上還有假人，制服，防毒面具，子彈帶，配給罐頭等等。一應俱全。</p>
<p>當然，在周圍十里之內不能有一個人類，但是我們認為研究原子彈對於生物的反應，實屬必要，所以在若干艘船隻上裝有鼠，羊和猪一類動物。</p>
<p>根據海洋學家和氣象學家的報告，我們已經在最安全的地方建築鋼骨水泥的瞭望所，配以最敏銳的攝影機，第一聯合特種部隊的艦艇自五月下旬起開始集合，下椗於比基尼島港內。第五百〇九混合航空隊的B—二九型機，將自加瓦林島根據地起飛，在目標區巡邏，實行演習。在日本投擲原子彈的，就是這批機羣。</p>
<p>在實行原子彈試騐這一天，從事此項工作的各種人員約三萬人，事前早就要各守崗位，以求一絲不亂。原子彈大致在上午投下，假定它是氣候必須絕對明朗，因此轟炸機可以準備投彈，不爽分毫。</p>
<p>九時三十分左右，就有戰鬥機和轟炸機在目標區上空以不同高度飛行，這些飛機都是用無綫電控制的，以便在原子彈爆炸時，試騐當時散佈在空中的放射性物質，這些飛機能否「倖免於難」固然大成問題，但是總要盡力使它們飛向根據地。</p>
<p>第一次試驗　需費五萬萬元</p>
<p>同時超空堡壘一架載着原子彈就從加瓦林島根據地起飛，一步一步要飛到三萬尺的高空，然後打開炸彈門向目標區投下炸彈，當時就會發出亮得人類所不能想像的閃光，從事暸望工作的人都要戴上特種防禦眼鏡，即在十幾里外的人，亦不能例外。原子彈所造成成的烟柱，衝入雲霄，高達三萬尺左右，彷彿是一柄龐大無比的巨傘。在這柄巨傘之中的慘烈情形，祗有聖經中所描摹的「世界毀滅」可以比擬。</p>
<p>在原子彈爆炸的時候，除了撫綫電駕駛的飛機在中間飛行以外，還有撫綫電駕駛的小艇在港內穿梭一艘的活動，測量在試騐各階段中的放射作用。經過了相當時間以從，就有第一批調查員在特種配備的保護之下，到禁區中去檢查航母，戰艦，小艇以至坦克，防毒面具，配給罐頭，羊，猪，鼠等物的被炸情形。凡是已炸死的動物，立即裝入冷藏箱中送到實驗室去，研究診斷，防止以及醫療日本人所謂「原子病」的方法。魚類專家則將着手研究比基尼區海洋生物慘遭「池魚之殃」的情形。華盛頓聯合參謀部在羣集各方報告之後，再作綜合性的研究，其中認為可以公佈的部份，則將像全世界好奇而關切的大衆報吿。</p>
<p>這幾次試騐的費用當然是極龐太的。據非正式佔計，大致在五萬萬美金左右。</p>
<p>世界上一切有思想的人都希望原子彈不再用作武器，我們對於這種懇切的願望極抱同感。我們的陸海軍領袖一致希望世界各國的政治家不久就能保證人類獲致持久和平，以法律來維持世界的秩序。但是在這個目標達到到之前，美國的武裝部隊就有充分研究各種武器性能的重大責任，而在國防上可以有恃無恐。</p>

<p>— 君默輯譯</p>
<p>兩顆原子彈迅速地結束了這場慘酷的戰爭，但也因為了原子彈，世界強國猜忌日甚，惴惴不安。廣島的一顆原子彈，使全市百分之七十都遭毀滅，人口傷亡三十萬。小如高爾夫球的一顆原子彈，怎麼會有如此可怕的威力？要解答這一個謎，我們必須先來看看，所謂原子和原子能究竟是怎麼一回事。</p>
<p>所謂原子，就是宇宙間一切物質的最小組織單位，在英文中稱為Atom，這字原是從希臘文中來的，意思就是「不可再分」。原子的種類，目前已經發現的有九十四種，依它們的輕重列成次序，氫原子最輕排在第一位，製原子彈的原料鈾，則排在第九十二位。構成原子的材料，主要的有三種，就是電子，質子和中子。電子是帶有一定量之陰電荷的微小質點，質子則是帶有與電子電量相等的陽電荷的微小質點，中子則不帶電荷。原子的真正構造，雖然非顯微鏡所能看見，但根據許多科學家的精密實騐和推斷，我們可以知道，原子內部乃是一個由質子和中子所構成的核，核外包團着一組旋轉不息的電子，這情形，大略和太陽與環繞在它四週旋轉的行星彷彿。</p>
<p>說到這原子核，是我們這問題裏最重要的一部分了。原子核的基本結構乃是質子和中子，關於此點，我們上面己說過了。質子是帶陽電荷的，擠在一起，非但不會互相要好，而且還會相拒相斥；至於中子呢，它不帶任何電荷，因此雖然不至於相拒相斥，但也決不會相互吸引結合。可是事實上，原子核却是個有着十分強烈的結合力的東酉，而且壁壘深嚴，非常不容易把它打破。那末，這一種巨大的束縛力量，究竟是那裏來的呢？據許多科學家多少年來的辛苦研究，我們終於知道了，這種強烈的結合力完全不是電力，而只是取價於中子和質子的一小部分質量。質子和中干一經結成原子核，便犧牲了若干單位的質量，來作結合時所需能量之用，這樣因為結合而犧牲的質量，稱為「質量虧損」。有趣得很，這虧損的質量却並不是白白蝕本的。只要能夠設法把這個原子核打破，那末原子核分裂時犧性了少許質量換來的原子能，就都可被釋放出來了。大略說來，一杯清水中深藏在原子核內的原子能，如果全給解放出來，就足夠使一艘瑪麗皇后號似的大郵船航行世界一周了。</p>
<p>所以目前的問題，就只在如何打破原子核，釋放原子能。科學家多少年來研究這個問題，經過了許多次的失欺和改進。終於實行利用不荷電的中子來打破原子核。幸運得很，我們又發現了，鈾原子核分裂時，不但放出了巨量的能，而且還有新的中子飛出，這新的中子又去轟擊別的鈾原子，放出更多的能，並飛出更多的新中子。原子炸彈的原理，就不外是利用鈾原子核被擊碎時所放出的巨大的原子能，太陽的巨大熱力，也即是由於原子核分裂時所放射出來的原子能。</p>
<p>這樣巨大而寶貴的原子能，宇宙間又是存在着如此之多，它如果被應用在建設性的工作上，可以使人類文明的進步一日千里，但如果不幸原子能被用在破壞性的戰爭中，那末整個的世界將化成灰燼。</p>
<p>去年八月六日上午八時十六分，廣島上空爆發的第一顆原子彈，連根拔起了大半個城市，傷亡之數達到三十萬以上。原子彈所炸過的地方，甚至是草本不生，變成一片荒蕪之土。</p>
<p>一顆爆發的原子彈，就好似一團大火球，它中心的熱度，達到十萬萬度，比普通炸彈爆發時所發生的熱力約強一萬倍。這比鎔鐵爐中倒出來的鐵液還熱的溫度，可以使一切接觸到的東西都化成灰燼。不單如此，原子彈的爆炸性還有一點是和任何其他爆炸物不同的。它另外發生一種力量稱為光壓力。原來太陽光或者燈光亦各都有壓力的，不過因為太微小了，所以我們不大覺察，但科學家們却早已在實騐室中計算過這種壓力了。這裏我們也不必舉什麼數學的公式，不過大略說來，原子彈爆炸時所產生的光壓力，將比普通炸彈的壓力，大〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇倍。如此大得驚人的壓力，不但將使附近的人類無法生存，而且將引起巨大的風暴，氣候改變，和以後幾個月甚至幾年間連續不斷的大小地震。</p>
<h3 id="c164">原子時代海軍移到海底活動　尼米茲海軍上將的見解 <a href="#c164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>— 家南</p>
<p>尼米茲海軍上將的見解是極中肯的，他絕對不承認海軍無用，但是承認在原子時代海軍必須實行革命性的變革，原子的威力固然驚人，可是在用途沒有完全確定之前，遽即主張取消海軍，賓在是一種不負責任的論調</p>
<p>七月一日將在比基尼羣島舉行的原子炸彈試騐，就是針對「原子炸彈對於海軍影響如何」這個問題而發生的。一切的改革將根據這一次試驗的結果而從長計議，目前還不能遽下斷語。旦是從一般的頃向看起來，已有若干跡象可尋。</p>
<p>據一般專家的意見，將來的海軍可能一部份甚至全部到海底下去活動，尼米茲對於這一點。也表示同意。</p>
<p>海軍一旦着重海底活動，潛艇顯然要佔重要地位。尼米資說：在雷達電波探知器已在廣泛使用的今日，無論是地面上的防禦設備，或者空中的飛機都逃不過這副「神祕的眼睛」，惟有在海底下行駛的潛艇，還不容易被發現，所以如其使用潛艇到敵人的海岸附近去放射原子火箭，或者運輸軍隊登陸，可以收「出敵不意」之效。再者，原子炸彈在深水中的威力，雖然因為沒有試騐過而還不明白，但是根據普通的學理推側，其破壞範圍大致比空中來得小，雖然震蕩的力量要大得多。根據若干美國潛艇人員的意見，在未來原子戰爭中可以存在的軍艦，惟有潛水艇一種，這種說法，不無理由。</p>
<p>但是在第一次世界大戰中已經發揮過很大威力的美國潛水艇隊，在構造上還有從多缺點，假如把目前的潛艇應用到原子戰爭中去，顯然還不能稱職。事實上直到第二次世界大戰的最後幾個月，世界各國的潛艇，都不是水底下的船而是水面上的船，因為它們潛伏在水底的時間極短，大部份的時間還是在水面上偵察，偶而或者作戰一陣。潛艇在水面上行駛的時候，由內燃引擎發電推進，但一沉到水面上，為了缺乏空氣關係，內燃引擎就得停止工作，動力全靠蓄電池供給，時間固然不長，速度也大受限制。例如美闕的標準潛艇，在水中駛行的最高速度每小時僅八海里。假如母小時行二海里，則可潛伏四十小時左右，假如在海底不動，則可維持六十小時，但是這不是在作戰而是在躲藏了。</p>
<p>但是在「明日的海軍」中，潛艇所佔地位的重要，在大體上講幾已成為定論了。</p>
<h3 id="c165">怎樣防禦原子彈？　不再打仗是最聰明的方法 <a href="#c165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>— 君默譯自「四海一家」雜誌</p>
<p>對於可怕的原子彈，我們是不是有什麼防禦的辦法呢？首先我們會想對：是不是能設法原子彈在極高空時便即爆發，因此地上可以不致蒙受損害？日本上空所丟下的原子彈，是在離地約一，五〇〇呎的空中爆浚的。炸彈上或是附有一個氣壓計的引綫裝置，使它在一定的高度時自動爆發，或者是用雷達計，那就是發出無綫電波，由電波從地面或海面的反射來控制一定的時間。當炸彈在極高空，我們的測量器所無法測及時，我們當然無計可施；如果已到了相當高度了，而它用的是雷達計，那末我們或者可以設法用無綫電波來使它提早爆發。但這即使成功，炸彈爆發了對地面也還是會有損害的。而且，如果它用的不是雷達計而是氣壓計，那我們根本就一無辦法了。</p>
<p>對於已臨頭上的原子彈，我們幾乎沒有什麼實際有效的對付辦法，歐戰結束前德國人用來製擊英倫的飛彈，就是一個例子。</p>
<p>一九四四年七月，飛彈開始摯英時，到達倫敦的有百分之三十五，到最後，能夠漏網進來的只有百分之九了，但百分之九已經使英國人束手無策。</p>
<p>對原子彈本身既已沒有什麼辦法，我們就只能設法來對付帶原子彈的敵機了，希望能使它在極還處便被擊毀不致影響到重要的城市目標。就偵察論，目前雷達的應用，已可以在任何天氣下測出二百哩以內，高度在四萬呎以下的一架轟炸機了。但要如此做，以美國論，全國至少要五萬人來担任雷達偵察，才有點用，而且這個偵察又必須是全日二十四小時，分秒不斷的。一月復一月，一年復一年，維持如此巨大的人才和財力來做這個工作是一個國家的財方所能辦得到的麼？在防守者，是每一份鍾，每一塊小地方都不能夠鬆懈一下的，但在進玫者，却可以隨便找那一天，那一個地方就成了。</p>
<p>即使說，我們知道了一二百哩外有敵機來了，我們又有什麼辦法來把它一一打下？高射砲和戰鬥機在這次大戰中已證明是老式而不中用了，將來的飛機必是利用無綫電操縱的無人飛機，其速度之高，不是任何坐人的戰鬥機可以追得上。由於速率之高，高射砍彈也極難把它們打中惟一所能想得到的辦法，只是發明一種速度極高的射擊彈，用雷達控制，使它能自動而準確地飛向飛機，把它擊毀。道個辦法，事實上現在恐怕已在科學家的研究之中了。</p>
<p>但即使這個發明也能成功，我們又何當能一舉而把來襲的敵機統統擊落，沒有一個漏網？近代的戰爭是完全出其不意的，數量之多，規模之大，使你無法能使它們不有少數漏網。而只要少數，只要一次，便已是決定性的毀滅了。</p>
<p>除非人類能夠聰明，永遠不再戰爭。否則，對於這個可怕的原子彈，人類可以說是完全無計可施。</p>
<h3 id="c166">火箭之中裝原子彈 <a href="#c166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>據美國一般的見解，將來假如發生戰爭，最重要的武器就是原子彈和火箭。關於原子炸彈的威力，不必贅述。至於火箭，據說它的速度，將來可以增加到每小時二萬二千八百英里，就是最保守的意見，也說可以達到每小時五千英里的程度。更重要的一點，就是可以命中預定目標，即使偶或有失，相差也不會超過半英里的範圍。假如在這種火箭中裝了原子彈，從一個國家成羣結隊地放射到另一個國家，從一個大陸放射到另一個大陸去，那麼俄頃之間，繁華的都市，樸素的鄉村，都有立刻化為灰燼的危險。</p>

<p>美國化學工程師達埃卡德是一個很了不起的預言家，他在一九四一年就預料在第二次世界大戰中將有原子彈出現，而在這種武器一被使用之後，戰爭不久就可以宣告結束，按諸事實，眞是一點不錯！</p>

<h3 id="c168">略談中國女小說家 <a href="#c168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>— 趙景深</p>
<p>自從去年十一月一日回滬以後，對現在已經半年了。總覺得在立煌的兩年比較悠閒，上海的這半年生活，特別煩忙，而且雜亂，是我近十餘年來所不曾經歷過的。頗想「偷得浮生半日閑」來欣賞文藝作品，事實上總未能如願。朋友們送給我的書和刊物，我都特別珍重，理出一個書廚來，專放這些書刊。我看重文藝界的朋友勝過一切達官貴人，每將仔細閱覽他們的作品，當作一種愉快。但既不得閑，也只好忙裏偷空，利用時間，在電車上或筵席上來翻閱；這樣的看書，心既不能寗靜下來，感受的程度之差是不言而喻的。</p>
<p>就在這樣的情形之下，我看完了羅洪女士的兩冊短篇小說集：「鬼影」和「這時代」。</p>
<p>忽忽看過之後，我有這樣一個印象：向來現代女小說家所寫的小說都是抒情的，顯示自己是一個女性，描寫的範圍限於自己所生活的小圈子；但羅洪却是寫實的，我們如果不看作者的名字，幾乎不能知道作者是一個女性，描寫的範圍廣闊，很多出乎她自己小圈子以外。我看過的創作太少，槪括論斷，容易陷入錯誤。倘若容我說一句臆想的話，那末在我的閱讀範國以內，以前女小說家都只能說是詩人，羅洪女士纔是眞正的小說家。</p>
<p>冰心是詩人兼小說家，她的「笑」實在只是散文詩。幾乎她的每一篇小說都有一個冰心在內。愛海，愛母親，愛小孩，充滿了抒情的調子。廬隱的「海濱故人」大約是她自己過去生活的寫照。淩叔華的「小亮兒倆」滲入了她自己的情感和愛好。綠漪的「棘心」可以說是她的自敘傳。即使是丁玲早期的作品。描寫的範圍也似乎只限於知識分子。陳學昭的「倦旅」也是抒情的。總之，她們的作品雖各有作風和特色，仍顯出是女子的作品，使讀者看清楚了烙印。但羅洪卻不同。除了偶然看見一些纖細的描寫，倘若掩蓋住作者的姓名，幾乎很難猜出這是女作家的作品—特別是與冰心凌叔華來作一個對比。</p>
<p>在羅洪以前、有過寫「二十年目覩之怪現狀」那樣的博涉來寫小說的女作家麼？也許有，甚至有不少，可惜，我再說一遍，我是在看書的工夫太少了。連沉櫻，鳳子的小說都還不曾讀過，冰瑩和白郎的小說也讀得不多。還有一些女小說家，我一時舉不出名字。</p>
<p>儸洪寫小說，似乎先由拘謹到灑脫，由工筆到寫意，由堆砌到白描。說老實話，有過一個短時期，我不喜歡她的小說，那就是那些拘謹的，工筆的和堆砌的。但是，拘謹，工筆和堆砌該是她寫小說的穩固的基礎。從拘謹解放到灑脫，從工筆解放到寫意，從堆砌解放到白描，比那一開始就灑脫到不可收抬，寫意到意不能主，白描到不夠力量，總要好得多吧？說來奇怪，特別是作為這兩本書名的「鬼影」和「這時代」我不喜歡。「鬼影」嫌其頭緒紛煩。幼時看「東周列國志」，連看幾遍，都沒有心緒看下去。過了一些時候再看，還是看不下去。「這時代」也寫得太凝重，不活潑，給予讀者的印象不鮮明。我希望作者以這兩篇小說作為書名，只是為了它們可以作為書名，而不是為了特別愛好這兩篇。</p>
<p>集中有幾篇可歌可泣的抗戰故事，但我尤其欣賞描摩人情世態的那幾篇。例如：鬼影集中的「踐踏的喜悅」，這時代集中的「友誼」「王伯炎與李四爺」「鄰居們」。</p>
<p>我希望作者做一個「女中吳沃堯」，「中國的巴爾札克，」繼續在社會小說這一方面努力！</p>

<p>夢，挾着一個灰色的龐大的影子，兇　地闖到一個倔強的年靑人底枕邊。</p>
<p>「無禮的！」它嚴厲地噴出威嚇的酷燄，用粗暴的蠻野的聲音說：「如果你再吝嗇自己生命的良心，以後，我將全部褫奪你所有的美好？」</p>
<p>年青人保持着平和的鎮靜，他以均勻的堅定的呼吸，疑惑的思想的音響，代替了顫慄的畏罪的回答。</p>
<p>「唔！我質問你！」龐大的影子緊迫地咆哮起來，並且揮動它的毛粗駱駱　，顯得權威一切地說：「在我所轄治的．展覽着人類底命運之財富的寶島上，你為什麼敢如此放肆地鼓着輕蔑的眼睛，而暗中以冷笑詛咒我的威嚴呢？」</p>
<p>像在無波的池塘投下一塊巨石，年靑人底心中激起高濺的水花，但是，他毫不畏怯，態度從容地說：</p>
<p>「你……可是，你是什麼人呢？—可怕的魔鬼！」他跟隨着想。</p>
<p>「我嗎？」龐大的影子沒有增加它底狂暴，不安的幌動表現着兇惡的沉思，刹那間，如同一個說謊者掙脫了受詰的破綻，便儼然而又驕傲地為自己的任務紹介說：「我嗎？我是你們人類底地獄之幸福的給與者；只要有誰願從我底意志的方向，那無論他所在的是怎麼一個困厄的飢寒的境地，他都能獲致無上的愉快與滿足！所以—」它略略遲疑的停頓了一下：「你的良心應獻給我！」</p>
<p>彷彿提高了他銳敏的警覺，一陣森冷的風，吹在年靑人的面頰上——</p>
<p>「哈哈，這怎麼可能呢？」他現出非常不信任的樣子。「良心是我的生命存在的價值，而你，奇怪的論調，不可置信！你既然說是我們人類之幸福的給與者，為什麼卻要予我天生的美好以嫉害呢？」說時，他似乎並不站在這個狹暗的小室，倒好像站在日常工作的真理的曠野。</p>
<p>「哼！居然敢抗拒我！你這個不識好歹的愚頑的傢伙！我吿訴你，你的理想全屬荒誕，它有助於你的將祗有沮喪和惱恨！」龐大的影子很快便露出原先的兇惡來。</p>
<p>而年靑的，他不能忍耐了！</p>
<p>「什麼？你這個侮辱純良的人類的鬼怪！」他握着拳頭想跳起來。「我知道你無非希圖藉人們的蒙昧與貪婪，維護虛偽的信仰和地位！你……」阿阿，這是怎麼的？……霎時，他底神經墮進了幻滅的空虛裏，明白自己是來自一處多麼可笑的，虛無的境界了。</p>
<p>年靑人全力地坐起來—</p>
<p>「唉，噩夢，無法解答的惡夢呵！」他迷惘地自語，把疑問的符號擲向窗外黑雲低壓的夜之天空。</p>
<p>「你在夢裏做了什麼呢？是不是？……」一個人的問語，朦朧的，惶惑而帶幾分嘲笑。</p>
<p>「我作了一次並不滿足的滔滔的雄辯。」是年青者回答的聲音。</p>
<p>「雄辯？你說……關於什麼的？」</p>
<p>不知那裏來的思想的風暴，他們之間的語言的水閘，於是在這靜寂的夜裏，由滲透，潰決，而汜濫了。</p>
<p>首先是坐在夢後的遺憾裏的年靑人說：</p>
<p>「請你以見解的全力，射擊我信仰的城堡吧！我說，人間的憎恨多於愛情。」</p>
<p>「你憎恨什麼呢？」</p>
<p>「我憎恨人類的心靈底污穢，他們永遠把自己視作無上的尊榮，而別人不過是因他的幸福而存在。我不知道這顆心為什麼恪印着如此許多不幸的痕跡，它不是揭露着自私的人們怎樣把禍害布施給異己，便是不平於那些命運的寵兒，用卑鄙的手段逃避他們應得的死刑；它不是記載着酖於利祿的人們，怎樣掩飾他們無可寬恕的淺薄，便是痛恨着那些貪慾的野心家的瘋狂……」。年靑者底痛苦的聲調，含着太多的憤激的成份。</p>
<p>「但是—唉唉，你沉靜些吧，你是否被夢裏的魔鬼帶到了醜惡和詛恨得深淵？……」說話的人，形似悲泣地揚手不知是否表示同情的軟弱的手勢。</p>
<p>年青者肯定地說：「你損失於年齡的已經太多了，我看見你一天一天的走近人類之陷阱的妥協的道路……」</p>
<p>「可是，不要忘記我們所走動的世界吧，它並不曾為你的年靑留下一點空隙……」</p>
<p>「你犯了好大的錯誤呀！」年靑人從床上躍起來了。</p>
<p>遍身油膩的燈　照亮了一室的幽暗，年靑者的激越的思想，有如一個健康的小孩，眺望在浩瀚無涯的人生之海邊——</p>
<p>「聽着：」他像翻開一頁彩色的傳奇，又如對一個愛好想像的孩子講述一段新鮮的故事，閃光的眼瞳浮泛着智　的夢幻的微笑。「不是我對人間的歡笑失望，而是它道德的萎靡損傷了自己的尊嚴；不要以為我對世界已無所希冀，因為這顆心並非僅為自己的幸福。愛豈但不是我的仇敵，而且是我生命的旌旗。如果說無動於世界的虛榮都是廢物，那末祗圖個人的享樂者便更可悲憐！</p>
<p>「阿阿，我是說塵世的風霜，會壓白你的華髪……」</p>
<p>「愛真理的人，為了工作，他永遠年青！」</p>
<p>當爭辯平息的時候，窗外的啼明鳥正開始歌唱，黎明的列車已經載來了新的一天……。</p>

<p>這倒教我想起那連年的烽火來了，在逝去的悠長底一段歲月里，我就始終不曾看見過這種顏色：近乎丹失的紅色果嚴，包藏着　白面有實汁的果實。而今，卸脫烽火的風塵再重溫童稚底舊夢時，這丹荔的顏色，恰如南國女兒火樣的戀情，（她逗引着我，於我是熟稔而又陌生。）能再燃燒我熄滅巳久的愛情麼？</p>
<p>呵，丹荔，這麼美的名子，蜜般的名子阿！</p>
<p>從梧蔭透露下來一綫陽光，淤移在丹荔攤上：有接受陽光親吻的丹荔，有的郤躲在照不到陽光的黯角里啜泣。</p>
<p>呵！南國的女兒，烽火連年，你們也許正和我在這都會里看到的丹荔一樣，有的沐浴在璀燦的戰火中，也有蒙風而暗泣的啊！</p>
<p>今天，太平歲月開始的第一個夏天，丹荔仍然是開了花結下果子，嫩白的蜜也似的果汁潤遍了年靑孩子的心田。丹荔呵，你鮮艷的顏色向我召喚着，祝福你無恙！</p>
<p>親愛的，各新我；我們的生命幾時開花呢？</p>
<p>牢籠</p>
<p>市上已是在出賣着竹　的牢籠，囚禁那暮色的小生命底時候了，孩子天真地童年我的　替他們買下一個，一個囚禁小生命的牢籠。那種小生命，在我的家鄉，稱他做：「叫哥哥」，　叫的聲音說不上市曼妙的樂曲，但還能夠對孩子們歡喜的，這樣，他就變做孩子們在涼席上細細的玩物了，世世代代。</p>
<p>我們人士聰明，但郤有着更大的　　，看到別的小生命的囚禁和殺害，往往回感到一種滿足似的喜悅。但，請聰明的人想想呵，我們自己呢，囚禁着我們青春的，又是什麽牢籠呀，（孩子怎會想到這些呢？）</p>
<p>人，就是這樣欺騙着自己，又滿足自己，才活下來的。</p>
<p>就這樣，人的中間，也有了距離。無可彌補底距離，因為人間就多着相互的欺騙和美麗的謊言。</p>
<p>那末，難道人就是這樣可憐地生活下米的麼？</p>
<p>聰明的人們，我想你們是能夠給自己滿意底回答的。</p>
<p>掙脫這牢籠的門吧！（三五，六，二十，）</p>
<h3 id="c173">初夏小簡 <a href="#c173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>— 明</p>
<p>初夏呵！我悵望那綠色的原野。</p>
<p>你不會想到，這裏，從窗外看出去，是一片斑駁而污穢的荒上。眼前，我失去了那片廣大綠色的草原，東邊伸過來的，僅僅是疏疏的幾枝梧桐，太少的綠色，招喚着綠色的記憶，終日追逐着我。而我終究也失去了你，沒有一句話，一個動作，一點眼色，冷淡而決然的。也便沒有怨很，僅僅有多少個的迫憶，惆悵地跟踪夏的季節而來！</p>
<p>江南沒有太熱的日子；山城的夏季能否遺留在你的記憶呢？初取的陽光從門外進來，些些寂寞的濫熱。太遠了阿！那片綠色的原野，消磨過不少生命的記憶！我默唸着二句：「玩世視財如視士，讀數憂道不憂貧，」這曾是嚮往冀求友誼的詩句。我認識你在那片綠色的原野。</p>
<p>在那裏，我們曾經同穿過草綠色的衣服。每大，晨曦微茫中，以一個摯熱年靑的心意，注視着祖國國旗的上升。在荒原的墳頭上，我們同看過月亮，數過星星。稱贊着莊子的人生，唸過李後主的詞句。這些都是不遠的記憶，而今卻遺落在渺遠的山城，在寂寞的江南，你不復記憶；「小樓昨夜又東風，故國不堪回首月明中。」那困苦而又快樂的日子吧！</p>
<p>你不再需要已逝的記憶，你是聰明而幸福的，你讀過壯子。那種綠樹紅樓，閒情雅緻的生活，使你倦忘了那些艱辛黑暗的日子。我們是兩個境遇中生活的人，孕育了兩個不同的人生。雖然我們曾經貫通着彼此某一點的共嗚，然而你畢竟離開我了！</p>
<p>我忘不了在黑暗的混亂中倒下去的，在光明的混亂中跌下來的，雖然我掙扎過了黑暗，也沒有在光明和混亂裏倒下來，並且還回到這江南；但我喘着微弱的氣息，在人生的途沿上蹣跚了腳步。這其問，我想望從你那裏得點生命的暖力的給予，讓生命藉此有些生的憑依，或許會走得堅定些。但是你，你畢竟走了，像一個久慣於咖啡和酒的刺激者，喝完了一杯需要的酒，沒有一些醉意，一些留戀，推閉杯子走了。那麼冷靜而爽朗。</p>
<p>你說你為了珍視另一個感情，你不得不忘記綠色的記憶，你怎樣為自己的德性和感情分辯着呢？我一直為這將痛苦嚙啃着自己，可是由此使我更了解一些生命的意義，在人生的途沿上記憶將更堅定了蹣跚的腳步，不再希冀着山林泉石的幻景。</p>
<p>我錯悮的從你手上接來一杯濃複的咖啡，而漠視了另一杯生命道上必需的淡水，我原是冀求淡水，卻喝錯了咖啡，一個不慣於苦甜朱的人，將是一種苦的回味。</p>
<p>記得你告訴過我，耶穌說：「諒恕別人是快樂」，我希望自己能時時記得這句話。</p>
<p>畢竟，我們曾經將生活結在一起，雖是那末短促的一段日子，在長串艱苦的日子裏，你也曾為我分担過一些微茫的幸福，它將永遠活在永生的記憶裏。</p>
<p>人生的道路是多麼遙長呵！而生命卻又如此的短促。等到有一天，你覺得需要人生途上的淡水時，我願意誠摯地為你貯藏一杯純淨的淡水。</p>
<p>讓我們忘記了不快和不美的！　一九四五，六，十二</p>

<p>為了孩子們第一次登台墨太太絕不能讓露出一種寒酸相來，所以特地給麗華麗雲每人訂製了幾套「行頭」。（即舞台上的服裝）並給麗華還訂製了兩套「頭面」。（即頭上帶的飾件）這又是一筆省不了的開支。將本求利，墨太太情願！她算計着，她將要在這些本錢之外，賺回無數的利息來。</p>
<p>除夕這天晚上，墨太太十分高興，她備了許多酒菜宴請石玉樓，翁二太太，張弦等。又給了麗華麗雲每個人一塊老袁頭的銀元昨壓歲錢。石玉樓，翁二太太，張弦也都每個人給了一塊銀元。麗雲樂得直跳，麗華依然不動聲色。</p>
<p>「小華·小雲·明天是你們，第一次登台的日子，可要給你們師父掙點面子呀！仔細唱砸了師父可要打你們。」墨太太笑向兩小姊妹叮嚀着。</p>
<p>麗華和麗雲沒言語。他們各自在想着各自的事。</p>
<p>「砸不了！瞧是誰的徒弟呀？俺張弦門前的桃李，沒個不開花的。」張自吹自擂地說罷，邪着眼向麗華貶了一下。</p>
<p>「別吹牛，沒準明兒兩個孩子上了台張不開口，那時侯仔細把你的絃子急斷了。」翁二太太打趣地說。</p>
<p>「放心，石嫂子！我包險。噢，你們瞅見沒有？戲園子的門口，我貼了一張大海報，上面寫着：「姊妹花墨麗華墨麗雲元旦隆重登台獻藝。」好些人都注了意，嘻嘻，明兒賣滿座的話，三分之二是你石玉樓的號召，三分之一得歸之於我們你對姊妹花！」張弦得意洋洋地誇耀着，像誇耀他自己的什麼光榮事績。</p>
<p>「真的，我今天還特意同妹妹一道去看了看，戲園門口正擠滿了人。」墨太太笑嘻嘻地說。她和張弦感到同樣的榮耀。</p>
<p>「唉！眼看咱們這一家人就有三個吃「開口飯」（賣唱為生的意思。）的了！」石玉樓感慨地說罷，有些難過的樣子。</p>
<p>「吃「開口飯」有什麼不好嗎？趕明兒他們也像你似的都掛了「頭牌」（優伶的各字壓了軸，叫「掛頭牌」，）才神氣哩！」張弦說。頗不以為然地聳了聳他的鷹勾鼻子。</p>
<p>「掛了「頭牌」，壓了軸，又有什麼植得「神氣」的？橫豎是供人家解悶兒！大年下也不能清間一會兒。」石玉樓煩惱地禁不住頂撞了張弦幾句，打着呵欠走出去。一面又回頭嚷着：「該上園子了我的琴師老爺！」</p>
<p>張弦應了一聲。輕佻地向翁二太太作了個鬼臉，咕嚕地說：</p>
<p>這叫吃一行怨一行！</p>
<p>翁二太太苦芙了一笑。她這時的心裏，比石玉樓更難受，她明白石玉樓的牢騷是言出由衷，因為石玉樓近來的身體很壞，雖然鴉片煙提着勁兒，勉強可以唱幾句，但是嗓子已經差多了。而生活的重担使他又不能不唱，目前他還能夠唱，過兩年，不能夠唱了，怎麼辦？所以他煩惱！他怨這一行！翁二太太愛他。憐恤他，卻無力帮助他。為了這原故，她近來常常背地裏流淚。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Legislative Yuan Passes Amnesty Bill; to be Promulgated and Implemented After Approval by the Chairman; War Criminals and Traitors are Not to be Pardoned or Have Their Sentences Reduced <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 25th] The amnesty bill, of nationwide concern, has been passed by the Legislative Yuan. It will be promulgated and implemented after the detailed amnesty implementation measures are jointly drafted by various courts and the Executive Yuan and submitted to the Chairman of the National Government for approval. The timeframe is expected to be no later than mid-next month.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 25th] In today's session, the Legislative Yuan, after two hours and ten minutes of intense debate, passed the amnesty bill, a matter of concern to all quarters of the country, by a majority vote of forty-three to fourteen. Since the Executive Yuan submitted the bill to the Legislative Yuan for deliberation, it was resolved in the 299th session of the Yuan on May 11 to "defer deliberation." Subsequently, due to a temporary motion by Committee Member Li Jinfang and thirty-two others, the 302nd session of the Yuan on June 18 resolved to "reconsider" it and return it for review. In today's 303rd session, the Criminal Law Committee and the Legal System Committee presented their review reports. After Committee Member Liu Kejin, the convener of the Criminal Law Committee, finished explaining the review report, a heated debate ensued. When the discussion began, committee members first debated whether petty corrupt officials should be pardoned or have their sentences reduced. Supporters argued that petty corruption was often driven by economic hardship and should be forgiven. Opponents argued that pardoning corruption would only worsen corruption in the future. However, most speakers supported the amnesty bill itself. Some argued that the current situation was not the right time for an amnesty. Supporters countered with arguments from various sources, engaging in a fierce verbal battle that nearly became a free-for-all. Finally, some committee members felt that the matter should not be delayed further to avoid causing problems and that a decision should be made promptly. Therefore, at 12:35 PM, Chairman Sun of the Yuan submitted the matter to a vote. Of the fifty-seven committee members present, forty-three raised their hands, and the amnesty bill, of national concern, was finally passed by a majority.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 25th] The 303rd session of the Legislative Yuan was held at 9:00 AM on the 25th in the Yuan's meeting hall. Sixty-eight committee members attended, with Chairman Sun presiding. In addition to two hours of heated discussion and the passage of the amnesty bill, the other important bills passed included: (1) Amendment to the Organic Statute of the Trademark Bureau of the Ministry of Economic Affairs; (2) Amendment to the Organic Law of the Military Advisory Council of the National Government; (3) Amendment to the Organic Law of the Ministry of Interior; (4) Rejection of the Executive Yuan's request for deliberation on the proposal to restrict the establishment of provincial and municipal banks by order; (5) Proposal that laws should be enacted separately according to their nature, and if it is necessary to leave a considerable period after promulgation and before implementation for the purpose of publicity, a separate implementation date should be specified. In addition, the Yuan session today unanimously passed the acceptance of the Charter of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization and adjourned at 12:30 PM.</p>

<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 25th] The military tripartite meeting, which concerns the rise and fall of the nation, the prosperity and decline of the country, and economic security, is scheduled to be held solemnly tomorrow morning. The central issues of this troop reorganization include the proportion of reorganization and the troop garrison areas. If the meeting progresses smoothly, it will then proceed to discuss various concrete measures for implementing the reorganization, such as the implementation procedures and dates for the withdrawal of Communist troops from railway lines and coastal ports (including Yantai and Weihaiwei), and the organization and supply of Communist troops after the reorganization. It is said that the government representatives participating in the negotiations on troop reorganization were originally planned to be Chief of General Staff Chen Cheng, accompanied by General Xu Yongchang. However, Chen's health has not fully recovered, so General Xu Yongchang will still attend the meeting. Xu has been reviewing maps for days and, together with senior staff members of the General Staff Headquarters of the Ministry of National Defense, has been personally sorting out various reports related to the implementation of domestic troop reorganization. He has been working day and night and is extremely tense.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 25th] It is reported that Xu Yongchang and Zhou Enlai spent the entire day today preparing for the troop reorganization meeting. Xu visited Special Envoy Marshall and it is also said that Marshall plans to visit Chairman Chiang tonight for discussions. According to those close to Marshall, Marshall's vigorous work ethic and calm mind have overcome the hot climate of Nanjing, and Marshall still has great confidence in China's peace.</p>

<p>[News Agency Report] San Francisco, 25th Broadcast: According to a dispatch from Nanjing, Chinese Communist leader Mao Zedong's accusation that the United States is threatening China's peace and security has caused serious concern at the Marshall Mission here. Marshall declined to comment on the matter, but a U.S. spokesman said that Mao's statement was purely propaganda. The Communist Party Chairman's accusation of the United States shows that the party has resumed its anti-American propaganda, which will have a serious impact on peace negotiations. Another well-informed U.S. source said that Mao's attack on the U.S. military aid bill to China was particularly fierce, but in fact, the purpose of this bill is to assist both the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. He pointed out that about one hundred U.S. officers have been stationed in Beijing for two months, waiting to go to Zhangjiakou after the military conflict ceases to establish a Communist military officer school. If both the Kuomintang and the Communist Party can abide by the agreement, they can equally receive U.S. aid and prevent China from falling into economic chaos.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 25th] A spokesman for the Ministry of National Defense explained on the 25th: The rumor that our navy bombarded Yantai and Weihaiwei originated from a fabricated report by the Communist New China News Agency from Laiyang on the 20th, intending to slander and confuse the public. In an attempt to seize Qingdao, the Communist army has not only gradually advanced towards the periphery of Qingdao with land forces since the beginning of this month, but also attacked Tuandao on the evening of the 16th with ninety sailboats from the Xuejiadao and Huangdao areas, intending to coordinate with the land forces. Our Qingdao naval fleet, in order to maintain maritime security, dispatched small warships to patrol the Changshan Islands. This is the routine duty of the navy. The Communist New China News Agency used this as an excuse to fabricate rumors, such as claiming that our navy bombarded Yantai and Weihaiwei, which is completely unfounded.</p>

<h3 id="e16">A Touching Scene for Chinese and Foreigners in the Capital's Continental Hotel; Kui Yanfang and Others Hosted a Press Conference Yesterday; Subei Refugees Sobbed While Narrating Their Suffering <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 25th] A touching scene for Chinese and foreigners was discovered in the Capital's Continental Hotel today. Kui Yanfang and eight others from Shanghai, who came to Beijing to petition, hosted a press conference here this afternoon and explained the reasons for their petition, hoping to obtain "peace" and recognizing the so-called "Xiaguan Incident" as a temporary "misunderstanding," unwilling to increase the current disputes and not intending to file a lawsuit. Zhang Xubo then translated for foreign reporters, especially emphasizing the "Xiaguan Incident." Subsequently, reporters asked about the process by which they were elected as representatives. Kui replied: "I never participated in the election, nor did I go to the meeting, but someone came to tell me that I had been elected because they said that I was involved in charity work, so they insisted that I come." At this point in the report, Cao Dayou, Wu Bingyang, Zhang Jiwen, Wang Benwei, and other Subei refugees came forward to narrate the cruel facts of the Communist army's occupied areas in Subei. They were all landowners and law-abiding common people, but they were forced to flee to other places due to the Communist army's harsh taxes. Among them, the most miserable was Zhang Jiwen, an elderly refugee of seventy-one years old, carrying his seven-year-old grandson. While narrating their suffering, tears flowed with their voices, and he instructed his grandson to kneel down and kowtow to the reporters and representatives, repeatedly saying: "We want to go back!" Kui was deeply moved by this tragic scene, and tears almost welled up in his eyes. He left his seat and went to the seat of the special correspondent of this newspaper in Beijing, saying in a very sincere tone: "What you said is all true, the refugees are really suffering too much!" and said: "I must report their suffering to Chairman Chiang, Mr. Zhou Enlai, and Special Envoy Marshall." The refugees then thanked him with tears and left. Moreover, foreign reporters at the scene today, witnessing and hearing the real situation of the Subei refugees, were greatly moved and gathered and left with reports from the refugees and the special correspondent of this newspaper on the number of refugees exiled from Jiangsu, Shandong, Anhui, and Henan provinces, as well as an analysis of the abnormal psychology of refugees who are disappointed, sad, angry, and have been accumulating for a long time.</p>
<p>Reporters' Speech; Refugees Applaud</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 25th] "Anti-Civil War" representatives hosted a press conference here today. Acting chief representative Kui Yanfang reported on the "Xiaguan Incident." As soon as he finished, five "Subei refugees" left their seats and came to the seats of the reporters and representatives to detail their personal experiences in the CCP's "liberated areas." One of them pointed to Kui and said: "You are the savior of the people, the savior of the people in the liberated areas!" Kui repeatedly explained that all the representatives were non-partisan and had no ambitions, and were selected by 53 industrial, commercial, and cultural groups, and have always been engaged in social work, and are now eager to promote peace and naturally dare not lag behind others. Kui also promised to raise the refugee issue to Chairman Chiang and Zhou Enlai. Two reporters also tried their best to persuade, and the five refugees returned to their seats. Subsequently, reporters asked the representatives to explain whether the groups they represented were legal (registered and approved by the Ministry of Social Affairs), and gave speeches sympathizing with the refugees. One of them said: The refugees not only beat the representatives, but also beat the reporters. The reporter of the Dazhong Daily, which is run by the Kuomintang, was also among them, which proves that the refugees have no political background. Another reporter narrated the killing of two elderly people by the Communist army, saying: "Fortunately, Shanghai has not been 'liberated', otherwise the elderly would have been killed too." The refugees listened and applauded.</p>
<p>Demanding that the CCP Withdraw from Subei</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 25th] The Nanjing Subei Exiled Refugees' Return Home Promotion Association hosted reporters this morning. Chairman Li Hongru and Zuo Gaokang recounted the atrocities of the Communist army in Subei and said: Since we fled from the Communist area, we have placed great hopes on the National Government. However, today there are disasters everywhere, and the government has repeatedly tolerated and made concessions. We have repeatedly endured, but our hopes have become a bubble. After disappointment, we can only ask the government to take responsibility, ask the CCP to lay down its weapons, and withdraw the Communist army from Subei. Please ask the Democratic League, the Youth Party, and non-partisan social leaders to speak fairly and do fair things. Please ask allies to go deep into the Communist areas to observe. The listeners were extremely indignant. Furthermore, the association solemnly stated that it was unrelated to the "Xiaguan Incident" and agreed that the perpetrators should be punished. The association will set out collectively tomorrow to petition.</p>
<p>Demanding a Stop to the "Three Alls" Policy</p>
<p>[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch, 25th] Subei refugees exiled in Zhenjiang, in order to oppose the civil war, request the central government to stop the CCP's "Three Alls" policy and withdraw the Communist army from Subei so that they can return to their hometowns.

<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 25th] Chairman Chiang is extremely concerned about the refugees' assault on Ma Xulun and others at the Xiaguan Railway Station. This morning, he specially summoned Director Wu Wenguan Dingchang, Minister Peng Xuepei, and others to inquire.

<h3 id="e19">Military Grain Reliance on Actual Levy and Supply: Xu Kan Explains the Land Tax Problem; Allocation Amounts for Each Province to be Determined Separately After Investigation <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 25th] Minister Xu Kan of the Ministry of Food, today analyzed for reporters the reasons for the high grain prices and the issues related to levying land tax in kind. He stated that since the victory last year, the 14 million *shi* of military grain that was no longer collected through conscription had to be purchased from the market, giving rice merchants an opportunity to raise grain prices. In contrast, grain prices in the rear provinces like Sichuan and Guizhou, where land tax was levied in kind, were more stable. Earlier this month, the financial revenue and expenditure conference decided to extend the method of levying land tax in kind for another year. Although it is known that levying land tax in kind is an outdated system, and it is also deeply understood that the eight years of war against Japan have caused great suffering to the people, the government has its own unavoidable difficulties. Currently, the demobilization of troops has not been completed, and huge amounts of military grain are still needed for supply. If land tax is not levied in kind, and military grain is still obtained through purchases, it will inevitably deepen the crisis of malignant inflation, and it is unknown to what extent prices will rise. Therefore, levying land tax in kind is an emergency measure before prices stabilize after the war. Once the economy is on track and prices are stable in the future, collection in cash should be restored. As for the allocation of levy and requisition amounts for each province, a detailed investigation of the disaster situation and production conditions in each province is necessary to ensure fairness.</p>
<h3 id="e20">Asia's Largest Generator Completed Installation in Peiping; Generating 10,000 Kilowatts; Second Unit to be Installed Next Year <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>[Our Peiping Dispatch, 25th] The Jibei Electric Power Company has installed a 25,000-kilowatt generator, the largest in Asia, in Shijingshan, west of Peiping. This generator is a trial product of Mitsubishi of Japan, named the Rui Yi-style turbine generator. After the machine arrived in Peiping, the Japanese installed only seven-tenths of it in three years. After the Ministry took over, it continued the installation, which took half a year, and was completed at the end of May. However, due to the shortage of materials, only the first boiler could be completed, which can generate 10,000 kilowatts. The second boiler can be completed around this time next year. The company today invited reporters to visit and see the three major features of the turbine: (1) It uses a pulverized coal machine, which crushes hard coal and sends it into the boiler with compressed air, which is more efficient than ordinary coal burning. (2) Ordinary boilers all use bituminous coal, but this boiler is specially made to utilize the Mentougou hard coal nearby. (3) It is manufactured with precision and uses very little coal. The Japanese have turbine generators installed in Harbin, but they are only 15,000 kilowatts. The generator will be officially put into operation at the end of this month and connected to the Peiping, Tianjin, and Tangshan power grid. After this, Peiping's electricity consumption (approximately 20,000 kilowatts) will no longer need to rely on Tianjin and Tangshan, and there will be no fear of shortages. The National Resources Commission also has a five-year power expansion plan. It has sent four American power experts to Tanggu and Tangshan to inspect and decided to build 200,000 kilowatts of thermal and hydroelectric power equipment near Tanggu to meet the needs of heavy industry in North China (especially the Tanggu New Port). The Jibei power grid generates electricity in Peiping, Tianjin, and Tangshan. Tianjin can generate 35,000 to 40,000 kilowatts, and Tianjin uses about 30,000 kilowatts. Peiping can generate 10,000 kilowatts, and Peiping needs about 12,000 kilowatts. Tangshan can generate 15,000 kilowatts, and the city needs about 5,000 kilowatts. They cooperate with each other to supply electricity to various parts of Jibei.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, United Press, New York, 24th] It is reported that the United States has signed a contract with the China Supply Committee, agreeing to design and build seven central power plants in Shanghai and other places for China.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Hanoi, 25th] A company of officers and soldiers of the ordnance maintenance team attached to the Second Honorary Division, with eight transport vehicles, was ordered to travel from Kunming to Vietnam to accompany the division headquarters to Japan. On the evening of the 21st, when they arrived at Phu Lang Thuong, two kilometers away from Hanoi, they were suddenly surrounded by French armed forces. Since this batch of troops entering Vietnam had been formally notified to and approved by the French, we immediately argued against being surrounded by armed forces, but to no avail. They were disarmed and detained in a hospital. All the money and belongings carried by the officers and soldiers were also searched and taken away. At that time, an American reporter happened to pass by the area on his way to Lang Son, and we asked him to notify the American military delegation in Hanoi to assist. Upon hearing the news, the American military delegation immediately made representations to the French military headquarters. On the morning of the 24th, the French military in Hanoi sent military police to Phu Lang Thuong to mediate, return the money and belongings taken from our officers and soldiers, and escort our officers and soldiers to Hanoi. However, the seized weapons have not yet been returned, and our company of ordnance maintenance team officers and soldiers has been detained for three days. After arriving in Hanoi on the evening of the 24th, the batch of officers and soldiers went to Haiphong on the morning of the 25th to report the incident to Division Commander Dai Jian of the Second Honorary Division and will lodge a strong protest with the French.</p>

<p>[Our Hankou Dispatch, 25th] Confirmed information: The highest administrative authorities recently noted that many heads of judicial officials in various places are serving in their native places, which not only easily causes disputes but also creates many difficulties in handling civil and criminal cases. To address this, they specifically ordered the judicial authorities to add recusal measures and instructed all levels of the judiciary to comply. After receiving the order, the Ministry of Judicial Administration instructed the presidents of the provincial high courts and the chief procurators to recuse themselves from their native provinces (i.e., not serve in their native provinces), and the heads of the county district courts to recuse themselves from their native counties. After receiving the order, the local High Court, because the president of the court, Zhu Shusheng, and the chief procurator, Mao Jiaqi, are both from Hubei, will be transferred accordingly. This recusal system is necessary for the environment, sufficient to strengthen the spirit of judicial independence, and is a major innovation in judicial administration.</p>

<p>Mr. Chen Guofu, a member of the Central Committee, came to Shanghai a few days ago and exclaimed loudly at a welcome gathering of the Central Political School alumni: "Shanghai is too dangerous! You must be careful not to be eaten or kidnapped!" This statement is truly an emergency warning to many Shanghainese and deserves the vigilance and precaution of each of us.</p>
<p>Although Shanghai on the surface has no jackals, wolves, tigers, or leopards, the things that devour people are, upon careful consideration, far too numerous. Dance halls, bars, secret gambling dens, brothels, and disguised traps masquerading as entertainment – all of which advocate theft and lewdness – are all man-eating beasts. When wild animals rush down from the mountains to eat people, people know how to resist them and how to protect themselves. But when a person is eaten by the gambling and licentious beasts of Shanghai, they willingly send themselves into their mouths, without any resistance or fear. From every afternoon onwards, countless brothels, gambling dens, and dance halls in Shanghai open their blood-soaked mouths at every corner, ready to seize people and devour them. And every day, countless people are eaten until their skin and bones are gone, and they remain unenlightened until death.</p>
<p>The most dangerous are those who have just come from the inland. Eight years of cruel enemy blockade have brought their daily lives to an indescribably difficult situation. Once they run to the dazzling and colorful Shanghai, and are also intoxicated by victory, it is inevitable that some of those with superficial cultivation will have their minds completely collapse. Gleaming gold, towering Western-style buildings, cars speeding by, beautiful women, stacks of American dollars, and jewelry like jade and diamonds – all open their huge mouths, waiting to devour them. In the ten months since the Japanese surrendered last August, overtly or covertly, those who have been eaten by gold, Western-style houses, cars, women, American dollars, diamonds, etc., are truly countless. Recently, even white rice has jumped up to eat people; the sensational grain loan corruption case is a prominent example.</p>
<p>Shanghai is truly a man-eating Shanghai. Mr. Chen Guofu's warning deserves our attention.</p>
<p>Originally, Shanghai was also a place with quite a few kidnappers. If parents are not careful, their children will be kidnapped. Although Shanghai has not yet heard of "flower snatchers" like in Beiping, there are even more cases of girls being kidnapped by bandits and sold into brothels or seduced and corrupted. Citizens who have lived in Shanghai for a long time are most familiar with this, and the recent incident of several female students being lured to other places was once regarded as a strange tale.</p>
<p>The difference is that Shanghai's kidnappers are now not only kidnapping children but also adults. They not only want to kidnap people's bodies, but also their souls. The kidnapped person, although their body is still at home or at school, and from the outside appears to have free actions and an independent life, in reality, their soul and thoughts have long been kidnapped without their knowledge. Chen Yuansheng was originally a very ordinary bank clerk; why did he steal so much gold and American dollars and flee? And why did several old Shanghai merchants get mixed up with those who claimed to be people's representatives and rush to Nanjing to join in the fun? This clearly shows that their souls had been kidnapped without their knowledge, and therefore their actions could not help but obey the orders of those who kidnapped them.</p>
<p>As discussed above, Shanghai is certainly extremely prosperous in material terms, and extremely capable of providing people with beautiful and satisfying enjoyment, but at the same time it is also extremely dangerous and the easiest place to fall. In spiritual terms, Shanghai, while easily inspiring people due to external stimuli, is also a place where various claims are novel and unconventional, and can easily dazzle people's eyes and confuse their minds, leading to reckless behavior.</p>
<p>Therefore, we hope that Shanghainese will study Lao Tzu's detachment and Confucius's steadfastness in poverty in terms of material enjoyment. These are indeed clichés of China for thousands of years, and may not be sufficient to match today's world, but if we have this kind of cultivation, at least it can prevent us from snatching Western-style houses and cars, and from wanting gold and American dollars. We treat everything that others consider remarkable as worn-out shoes and dung. Is this pedantic? Is this foolish? Absolutely not. When others' misdeeds are exposed, they are imprisoned, interrogated in court, and in an instant, their reputation is ruined and their lives are uncertain, we still enjoy complete self-satisfaction. That is definitely not something that clever people who are seduced, eaten, and kidnapped by material things can compare with.</p>
<p>At the same time, we also hope that Shanghainese will be in good spirits. Even though they often interact with foreign friends, they should know that China still has our traditional essence in the principles of cultivating oneself, managing one's family, governing the country, and bringing peace to the world, and there is no need to abandon what is near and seek what is far, causing unnecessary confusion. Frankly speaking, in the post-war world, the democracy of Britain and the United States and the socialism of the Soviet Union must gradually converge and move towards harmony, and then world peace can be guaranteed. The British Labour Party is trying to walk this path. We should be glad that our Three Principles of the People, when truly implemented, will open up this path. In politics, we must use the Principle of Democracy to extract the strengths of Anglo-American democratic politics, and in economics, we must use the Principle of People's Livelihood to harvest the fruits of Soviet socialism. In other words, we must no longer adopt the dictatorial politics of the Soviet Union's one-party rule, nor can we follow in the footsteps of the old capitalist economic system of Britain and the United States. If we can steadfastly adhere to this belief in spirit, we will naturally not be kidnapped to be the followers of capitalism or the sacrificial offerings of communist dictatorship by echoing the views of others.</p>
<p>Life is like a white colt flashing past a crevice; wealth and glory are all like a dream. Let us all take advantage of the moment while we still have breath to do our best for the interests of the country and the nation. Do not follow the crowd, seek novelty, or indulge in eccentricity, leading to the dissipation of our souls and the alteration of our will, and finally be eaten and kidnapped by invisible beasts and kidnappers.</p>

<h3 id="e38">Internationalization of the Port of Trieste: U.S. and Soviet Union Expected to Reach Compromise, Representatives of the Two Countries to Hold Extracurricular Meetings, Four Foreign Ministers Reject Amendment to the Italian-Austrian Border Request <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] London, 25th (Radio): The Four Foreign Ministers held a meeting today to discuss points on which they could not agree. At the same time, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov suddenly and voluntarily visited Byrnes, and therefore, hope for the Paris Peace Conference has been renewed. It is rumored that the U.S. and Soviet Union may reach a compromise, with the compromise being the internationalization of the Port of Trieste for a period of ten years.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Paris, 24th (United Press Telegram)] Byrnes and Molotov held a surprise one-hour meeting today. Diplomats believe that Molotov may have received instructions from Moscow regarding the most difficult Trieste issue between the four countries. During today afternoon's meeting, Molotov, adopting a diplomatic sit-down strike posture, refused to agree to any suggestions regarding the Italian treaty, and representatives of various countries then turned to discuss treaties with the Nazi vassal states in the Balkans. Some commentators believe that Molotov's lack of consideration for the Franco-Italian border and the disposition of the Italian Navy is because he does not want to reach any agreement on these issues before the Trieste port issue is resolved.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 24th] The Foreign Ministers' meeting was held twice today, in the morning and afternoon, to discuss four issues for a long time, namely: (1) the border between Italy and Austria, (2) the border between France and Italy, (3) the method of distributing the Italian fleet, (4) freedom of navigation on the Danube, (5) the most thorny issue of the affiliation of the Port of Trieste. Although the atmosphere at the meeting was extremely friendly, no substantive agreement was reached on any of these issues. Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov and U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes met alone this afternoon to discuss the fourth issue; the details are unknown. Regarding the Austrian-Italian border issue, Austria's requests to Italy involved a major revision of the border, not a minor issue, and have been rejected by the four Foreign Ministers. Regarding railway traffic between the Austrian cities of Innsbruck and Linz, the four Foreign Ministers believe that guarantees should be given to facilitate it, and the matter has been referred to a committee of experts for discussion. Regarding the Franco-Italian border issue, France made five demands on Italy, and the Foreign Ministers' meeting has accepted four of them: (1) the Saint Bernard Pass, (2) the Mont Cenis Pass, (3) the Mont Thabor and Chaberton area, (4) the valleys of the Tinee and Vesubie rivers; all the above-mentioned areas have been ceded to France. Regarding the distribution of the Italian fleet, French experts have proposed a compromise plan for the ratio of Italian warships to be retained. The Soviet Foreign Minister immediately expressed his agreement, and an agreement could have been reached in principle. However, the U.S. and Britain refused to agree to the annexes proposed by Molotov, and an agreement could not be reached, but the door to amendments remains open. Regarding the issue of freedom of navigation on the Danube, although the four Foreign Ministers agreed in principle, the Soviet Foreign Minister also argued that all proposals on this matter should be submitted for discussion by the countries along the Danube, while the U.S. and Britain insisted on their original proposal, demanding that the matter be included in the peace treaty with Romania.</p>
<h3 id="e39">Security Council Discusses the Spanish Question, Polish Proposal Rejected, Three-Member Committee Formed to Draft Appropriate Report <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>[Associated Press, New York, 24th] The United Nations Security Council today rejected, by a vote of seven to four, Poland's motion demanding the immediate severance of diplomatic relations with the Franco government of Spain. This motion was proposed by the Polish representative, Lange, on April 19th. (1) At today's vote, the representatives of the Soviet Union, France, and Mexico raised their hands in favor. Chinese representative Guo Taiqi first expressed his opposition. As one of the five major powers, China has the power of veto, so China alone was sufficient to overturn the motion. However, Guo did not declare that he was exercising the veto power. The other countries seconding the opposition were the U.S., Britain, Australia, Canada, and Brazil. After the vote, the Polish representative re-proposed that the issue remain on the Security Council's agenda so that it could be re-discussed before the United Nations General Assembly meets on September 1st. The meeting then decided that a three-member committee composed of representatives from Australia, Poland, and Britain would draft an appropriate report on the Spanish question. Before discussing the Spanish question today, the Security Council passed a new rule allowing the President of the Council to temporarily step down from the presidency when considering issues related to the country he represents.</p>

<p>[Kozosha, Tokyo, 25th] The Japanese cultural community had heard of President Chiang's book "China's Destiny" during the War of Resistance, but it was impossible to obtain it due to the strict blockade policy of the warlords. On the 23rd of this month, the Shanghai Kozosha Daily News sent a special plane to transport a large number of books and publications, including 10,000 copies of "China's Destiny" and "President Chiang's Speeches to Japan," which were snapped up by bookstores.</p>
<h3 id="e41">Atomic Energy Control: Australian Representative Evatt Proposes Compromise, Proposes the Establishment of an Administrative Committee to Reconcile U.S. and Soviet Differences <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>[Associated Press, New York, 25th] The Australian representative to the United Nations Atomic Energy Control Committee today proposed a suggestion, advocating the establishment of an administrative committee to draft an atomic energy control plan, and to reconcile, to the extent possible, the differing views in the plans proposed by the U.S. and Soviet Union. The U.S. plan advocates first establishing the highest control agency, which will eventually evolve into an international atomic management agency, as proposed by Baruch. The Australian representative's suggestion seems to endorse this, but opposes the Soviet Union's plan to establish two separate committees, one to exchange scientific information on atomic development among the United Nations, and the other to be solely responsible for atomic energy control. The suggestion was revealed by Australian Foreign Minister Evatt, who is also the chairman of the United Nations Atomic Energy Committee, and the committee is scheduled to hold its third meeting at 9:00 p.m. today.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper News] London, 25th (Radio): The British delegation's work in India has completely failed, and it is scheduled to issue a statement tomorrow and leave India to return to the delegation in two or three days. Jinnah, the leader of the Muslim League, met with the Viceroy of India and the British delegation today; the content is unknown.</p>
<p>[Reuters, New Delhi, 24th] The Executive Committee of the National Congress presented a brief letter to the Viceroy of India, Wavell, this afternoon, stating that it rejected the suggestion of establishing a provisional government. The detailed reasons will be presented tomorrow. There is no hope that this stalemate cannot be broken, because if the National Congress can accept the British Cabinet's long-term plan, the issue of establishing a provisional government may as well be discussed again from the beginning. Nehru, the President of the National Congress, met with Cripps today to discuss issues related to the long-term plan. Gandhi is also scheduled to meet with the Cabinet delegation tonight. The Executive Committee of the National Congress will meet again on Thursday, at which time a decision may be made on the British side's long-term plan. The Muslim League has previously expressed its acceptance of the British side's long-term plan. Today, the Executive Committee of the League held another 90-minute meeting to discuss the issue of the provisional government, but no decision has yet been made. In addition, the orthodox Hindu organization Mahasabha will also meet to discuss the steps to be taken after the National Congress announces its decision.</p>
<p>[Reuters, New Delhi, 24th] It is generally believed that the National Congress is unwilling to immediately accept the long-term plan proposed by the British representatives because the government of Bengal issued a circular announcing the procedures for submitting candidates. The National Congress believes that this move is intended to make the candidates accept the provincial division system. The British Cabinet Ministers are explaining this matter.</p>
<p>[Reuters, New Delhi, 25th] Political observers here predict that the British delegation will issue a formal communique today, which may announce the decision to reconsider the plan for the Indian provisional government.</p>

<p>[Kozosha, Tokyo, 25th] In order to alleviate Japan's food shortage, MacArthur's Headquarters today formally issued an order permitting the expansion of Japan's fishing area to more than twice its previous size. The main points of the order are as follows: (1) With the current fishing area as the center, it can be greatly expanded to the east, and can also be expanded to the south and west to a considerable extent. As a result, the monthly catch can be increased by 3,000 to 5,000 tons in the future. (2) Specific Japanese fishing boats are allowed to fish in the southwest of the East China Sea. (3) The expansion of the fishing area has nothing to do with the political position of the United Nations in the future.</p>

<p>[United Press, Bikini Island, USS McKinley, 25th] A bulletin from the flagship of General Blandy, commander of the atomic bomb test, stated: Last night's exercise was completely successful. When the atomic bomb was dropped during the exercise, it emitted a huge spark and hit the target. The issue of many disasters caused by debris during the exercise is still under study. Among the 42,000 test personnel, there is much discussion about other disasters that will occur.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, En Route to Bikini Island, 24th] The U.S. Navy will encounter an unusually "safety first" task in the Bikini atomic bomb test. This refers to the 34,000 personnel on the 150 ships, which will be arranged in a circle about 40 miles outside the lagoon where the atomic bomb is detonated. In addition, more than 100 aircraft will circle overhead, reaching the stratosphere, to observe the clouds rising from the atomic bomb explosion. Drinking water will also be subjected to a safety-first operation to eliminate radiation, which is unprecedented in world history. Drinking water on board is normally distilled from seawater. To prevent it from containing radiation. The crew members are most afraid of the X-rays emitted by the flash of the atomic bomb. In fact, this is a misunderstanding, and the Navy has taken various precautions to ensure that all personnel are not exposed to even a trace of X-rays. It is said that anyone within two miles of the flash of the atomic bomb will temporarily lose fertility. Many Japanese men in Hiroshima lost their fertility as a result.</p>
<h3 id="e51">Far East International Military Tribunal: New Stage of Witness Testimony Yesterday; Defendant Hata Shunroku's American Defense Attorney Files a Petition; Webb States Direct Speech is an Australian Trait <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>[Reconstruction Society Tokyo, 25th] The International Tribunal's trial proceedings, from the 17th until yesterday, were all about the recruitment of witnesses related to military specialized education and propaganda in preparation for war, with a review of evidence. A total of two American witnesses and eighty-one Japanese witnesses were summoned. Yesterday, the final summons was for former Police Bureau Chief Koizumi Gorō, marking the end of the first stage of witness questioning. Starting today, the proceedings will move on to examine the core of war preparations: political instability, the military's pressure on the government, and the national reform movement. The events to be examined include the collapse of the Tanaka Giichi Cabinet, the abortion of the Ugaki Kazushige Cabinet, and the downfall of the Yonai Mitsumasa and the third Konoe Fumimaro Cabinets. Furthermore, the Hamaguchi Osachi assassination attempt, which was the main cause of such political unrest, the long-unreleased March Incident, the Blood Pledge Corps Incident, the May 15 Incident, the February 26 Incident, and the establishment of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association will also be addressed. It is expected that political giants such as Yonai, Wakatsuki, Ugaki, and Marquis Tokugawa Yoshichika will all be summoned to testify.</p>
<p>[United Press Tokyo, 25th] The International Tribunal continued its hearing today. The defense attorney for defendant Hata Shunroku, former Commander-in-Chief of the China Expeditionary Army, Mr. Lazardus, submitted a petition stating that some of the charges in the indictment against his client were cases of mistaken identity. He requested that retired Lieutenant General Hata Hiko be summoned to court for cross-examination to prove that it was the Lieutenant General involved in the Manchurian Incident, not the defendant Hata Shunroku with the same surname. Lazardus stated: Lieutenant General Hata Hiko was the Chief of Staff of the Japanese Kwantung Army when the Soviet Union entered the war, and his whereabouts have been unknown since then. Therefore, to investigate the crimes of "Hata so-and-so" mentioned in the indictment, this person must be summoned for cross-examination. In 1938, Hata Shunroku served as the Commander-in-Chief of the Central China Expeditionary Army, and the following year he served as the Lord Chamberlain to the Emperor. In August 1939, he served as the Minister of the Army and the Director-General of the Manchurian Affairs Bureau. His final position was as the commander of the Second Army Group. When the court convened today, Judge Webb drew attention to an analysis of the trial situation published in the Japan Times today by United Press. Webb said: "The article mentions that I speak the most, but you must note that I am the only judge with a microphone. There are ten other competent judges present who are giving me the greatest assistance. The article states that I spoke rudely to the defendants. Generally, I speak directly, which may be mistaken for rudeness. As I am Australian, direct speech is a characteristic of my country."</p>

<p>An 68-year-old Man Absent-Minded; Mistakenly States He Was Born in 1972</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Tokyo, 25th] During the war crimes trial this afternoon, when former Prime Minister Shidehara Kijūrō testified, the defense lawyers of the twenty-eight major Japanese war criminals made appropriate defenses. Shidehara's testimony was very favorable to Minami Jirō and Shigemitsu Mamoru, who signed the surrender document. In his testimony, Shidehara stated: When Minami Jirō was the Minister of the Army, he made every effort to cooperate with his pro-China goodwill and peace policy. He was unwilling to include Minami Jirō in the military clique, [this] military clique could not be controlled by Minami Jirō's Ministry of the Army at that time. Shidehara stated: During his tenure as Foreign Minister, the Japanese Cabinet did not have any intention of territorial expansion. The "Manchurian Incident" was also not the policy of the regular government. The cabinet at that time was forced to resign due to the occurrence of the "Manchurian Incident." Shigemitsu Mamoru was the Minister to Nanjing at the time and was ordered to implement his pro-China goodwill and peace policy. "I greatly trust Shigemitsu Mamoru and am very satisfied with his implementation of my China policy." The usually dull meeting suddenly became lively this afternoon, as today's testimony gradually became more attention-grabbing. The defendants, who usually listened to the reports with an indifferent attitude, suddenly became tense and attentive this afternoon. Minami Jirō, who was most related to this afternoon's trial, appeared indifferent due to hearing loss. Shidehara, who is 68 years old, suddenly appeared absent-minded in the calm atmosphere of this afternoon's meeting. When this elderly baron said, "I was born in 1972," the entire court, including all the defendants, burst into laughter.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper Report] After the abduction of flour and cotton tycoon Rong Desheng, all parties are still paying close attention to the case. Unexpectedly, at 3:30 AM yesterday morning, the Shanghai Inspection Office of the Garrison Headquarters suddenly received a secret report stating that the bandits in the case were hiding in the residence of Chen Tongsheng, an architect, at No. 4, Lane 440, Rue Raoul-Doën. A large number of personnel were dispatched to surround the premises. However, upon arriving at the destination, due to the extreme darkness inside the house, the Changshu Branch of the Police Bureau, the Jing'an Temple Branch, and the Motorcycle Team of the General Bureau were immediately notified to assist with a large number of armed police, and the residence was surrounded. Unexpectedly, the bandits inside the house opened fire first, resisting arrest. Therefore, the military police also opened fire in retaliation.

<h3 id="e57">Eighty-Four Houses Left by German Nationals: Already Distributed; Some Allottees Still Unable to Move In; Strict Prevention of Further Illegal Occupation <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] The Housing Allocation Committee for Shanghai Agencies under the Executive Yuan held a meeting yesterday afternoon and resolved that the work of the committee's investigation team could be concluded by the end of the month, and it was planned to lay off 30 people. Future work will focus entirely on statistics and allocation. Furthermore, a portion of Japanese nationals will soon be repatriated. To prevent illegal occupation of abandoned houses, the committee notified the Japanese Nationals Management Committee to submit a list within one week to the committee. The houses will be pre-allocated to approved agencies before the Japanese nationals are evacuated. Once the Japanese nationals leave the houses, the agencies will be allowed to take possession. Furthermore, the committee has found it difficult to allocate German national houses. Recently, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs replied that some German nationals will continue to reside in Shanghai, resulting in some agencies receiving allocation notices and finding that the houses were still occupied when they went to inspect them, making it impossible to move in. The Housing Committee will discuss a solution separately. Currently, the German national houses that have been allocated include those to the Jiangsu Provincial Supervisory Commissioner's Office, the High Court, the High Court Prosecutor's Office, the District Court, the District Court Prosecutor's Office, the U.S. Consulate, the U.S. Naval Office in Shanghai, "UNRRA," the Canadian Consulate, American engineers from the Executive Yuan's Engineering Planning Group, and American shipbuilding experts from the Jiangnan Shipyard, totaling eighty-four houses. The German national furniture will be temporarily kept by the personnel of the agencies taking possession, and will be sold later. The committee stipulates that when the recipients go to take possession of the houses, they must check and count the furniture one by one according to the list provided by the German nationals and sign the list in quadruplicate. One copy will be given to the German nationals, one copy will be kept by the recipient, and the remaining two copies will be submitted to the German Nationals Management Committee for record. The recipient will be responsible for compensation if there are any shortages in the future. It is also heard that those who tear down the seals on sealed houses and illegally occupy them will have their supervisory agencies severely punished. Owners requesting to take back their houses for their own use are limited to one house. The unified allocation of Japanese national houses, totaling fifty houses, will be held next Wednesday.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper Report] The sluggish land transaction in this city is mainly due to the excessively high land sales tax rate (50% must be levied). When Director Zhu of the Land Administration Bureau attended the financial revenue and expenditure conference in Beijing, he held informal talks with the authorities on this matter. The government has expressed that it intends to abolish this tax rule soon. In the future, land price tax and land value increment tax will be levied progressively according to the Land Law and according to the change of currency value to seek reasonableness. Furthermore, in order to sympathize with residents who have no houses to live in, the city government allows citizens to request the use of public land to build factories or residences. However, in order to prevent the use of land for profit, strict measures will be formulated to show restrictions. The Land Administration Bureau is currently actively handling land registration, starting with the six districts of Huangpu, Hunam, Caohua, Fahua, Yinxiang, and Zhabei. If no disputes arise two months after the application for registration, the bureau will issue a land ownership certificate.</p>

<h3 id="e69">Xu Enzeng's Thirty-Year Plan: Founding the Jianguo Machinery Agricultural Reclamation Company; Promoting Agricultural Industrialization <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] Xu Enzeng, the former director of the Central Investigation and Statistics Bureau, has been residing in Shanghai since leaving political life, resuming his position in the industrial sector from sixteen years ago. He has raised funds to establish the Jianguo Machinery Agricultural Reclamation Company, which has been going on for several months. When the reporter visited him the other day, Mr. Xu passionately discussed the issue of agricultural industrialization in China. He said: "The future agricultural industrialization of China is an inevitable trend and an inevitable development to adapt to the trends of the times. The reconstruction of rural areas after the war depends on the organization of scientific methods, and the demand for manpower in the future reconstruction cause is extremely urgent. The efficiency of mechanical cultivation compared to manual cultivation is at least a ratio of one hundred to one. The surplus manpower can be used to develop other reconstruction causes. However, the general level of knowledge of farmers in our country is low, and to achieve agricultural industrialization, we must go through a considerable process."</p>
<p>The establishment of the Jianguo Machinery Agricultural Reclamation Company aims to assist the government in promoting agricultural industrialization. As for the promotion methods: (1) Mechanization: Adopt gradual promotion and use machinery to replace manual cultivation. (2) Collective Management: In adjacent rural areas, jointly use a machine for cultivation, so that poor farmers have the opportunity to use machinery. The initial targets for promotion are the Taihu Lake Basin, the Dongting Lake Basin, and the Subei area, with Subei as the main focus. It is also planned to select a certain place near Shanghai as an experimental demonstration area. In terms of machinery, from plowing to harvesting, including five different machines as a set, the value of each set of machinery is currently about US$5,000. It is estimated that five sets of machinery can cultivate 10,000 acres of land. Taking Subei as an example, the cultivable land is about 10 million acres, which requires more than 5,000 sets of machinery. Judging from the current situation, the economic strength of the general rural areas of our country and the ordering of huge amounts of machinery are difficult. Therefore, the completion of agricultural industrialization in China will require at least five years or even ten years. Mr. Xu stated: "He intends to devote the next thirty years to the work of agricultural industrialization."</p>

<p>The Reconstruction of North China Possesses Superior Conditions: Its Fur and Cotton Production are Comparable to the World</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Bei Zuyi, Governor of the Central Bank, having just returned from an inspection of North China on the 23rd, met with members of the city's press at the Central Bank at 10 o'clock yesterday morning. According to what was discussed, the impression from this trip was quite good. However, the revitalization of North China's economy and finance, as well as domestic and foreign trade, truly depends on the early restoration of transportation. He stated: North China is one of the economic and financial centers of the country. During the period when the enemy and puppets occupied it, control was especially strict. Although there was some impact on the financial aspects, the material impact was still less. Therefore, generally speaking, the economic situation in North China is actually more stable than in this city. For example, people's lives and market trends are both calmer than in this city. Wages are also lower than in this city, and the scale of agriculture and industry in all aspects has a foundation. Therefore, once the overall situation clears and transportation is restored, goods can flow freely, and North China will not be difficult to become the starting point for our country's economic recovery. Bei then cited the fur specialty of Baotou in North China as an example. According to reports, due to the lack of transportation, the value of the stockpiled inventory of this specialty is over US$10 million. If this specialty can be exported steadily, it will not be difficult to compete in the world market. As for the production of cotton in North China, it is not only sufficient for domestic use but also has a surplus for export, as was the case before the war. Therefore, if transportation is restored, the supply of domestic materials can be smoothed, and agricultural products from various places can also be exported steadily. Bei also earnestly expressed his determination to assist in export trade. Reporters then inquired about opinions on improving the current foreign exchange policy. Bei replied that the Central Bank implements all financial measures in accordance with the established policies of the authorities, so it is inconvenient to comment on the various opinions expressed to the outside world. It is heard that Bei, together with Consultant Yang Ge, Lu Dingzhong, Chen Guangfu, and others, took the night train to Beijing last night to make requests to the authorities.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Wang Daren and Ren Xingyai, the main culprits in the grain loan fraud case, were previously detained in the Detention Center of the District Court because of the severity of the case. The District Procuratorate had already conducted two investigations. Yesterday afternoon, around 4 o'clock, Prosecutor Wu Qihua summoned Wang and Ren again for a third investigation. It is said that Wang Daren's confession mentioned Xu Kan quite a bit. The investigation was completed at around 5 o'clock. They were then returned to the Garrison Command.

<p>The Municipal Social Bureau, in view of reports that some rice shops are selling low-quality rice as high-quality rice, has sent staff to investigate and ordered the rice shop industry association to instruct all members to earnestly correct this.

<h3 id="e83">The Subei Refugee Youth League Speaks Out for Arrested Fellow Townsmen <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the Xiaguan incident, the Subei Refugee Youth League residing in Shanghai issued a statement to people from all walks of life, stating that the Subei refugees who were displaced in the capital and the "people's representatives" Ma Xulun and others who went to Beijing from Shanghai to petition had a conflict, resulting in many injuries on the spot, and some refugees were arrested by the military police and treated as criminals. The league believes that the measures taken were unfair. The statement states that the Subei refugees have long suffered from the poison of the Communist Party, so they requested to meet with these "people's representatives" arriving in Beijing to relieve their suffering, but unexpectedly they were regarded as having ulterior motives, which led to emotional impulsiveness and the occurrence of beatings. The exiled youth league now claims: it is determined to support the fellow townsmen who were mistakenly detained by the government because of the Xiaguan incident and is determined to vindicate their grievances.</p>

<p>Mr. Shen Honglie Tells Reporters After Inspecting Schools in Hangzhou</p>
<p>[Our Hangzhou Special Dispatch] Shen Honglie, Chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, accompanied by education personnel, visited five private middle schools in Hangzhou on the afternoon of the 24th: Qinghua, Zhengze, Zhongshan, Hongdao, and Huiyu, successively. He inquired in detail about the funding, equipment, teacher salaries, and student meals of each school. After the inspection was completed at 5 pm, he told reporters: "The secondary schools in Hangzhou are significantly better than the situation in the counties inspected previously. In terms of school buildings, the Hangzhou Normal School is the most complete among the provincial schools. The rest are incomplete and dilapidated. Private middle schools such as Hongdao, Donglan, and Huixing are complete and adequate. However, all schools lack equipment. Regarding teacher salaries, we should strive to make them equal to those of civil servants, and private schools should also do the same. Since the Anti-Japanese War, education personnel have lived frugally but have still been able to uphold their positions, which is commendable. This year, the educational funding allocated is very little, and the post-war recovery funds for each school are actually insufficient. Furthermore, since the financial system reform on July 1st, the provincial finances have not improved slightly. Therefore, school operators will still face numerous difficulties. This situation will require two or three years of arduous support before any improvement can be seen." He also scheduled a discussion meeting with the principals and teachers of public and private schools in Hangzhou on the afternoon of the 25th and scheduled a lecture for students on the afternoon of the 26th. He will inspect hospitals throughout the city on the 27th. (Butterfly)</p>

<p>Today at 5:30 PM at the Lyceum; Related to Charity, Hope for Enthusiastic Ticket Purchases</p>
<p>The disaster situation in Central Hunan and Northern Jiangsu is severe. Du Yuesheng, Wu Kaixian, Zhang Shizhao, Fan Shaozeng, and Gu Jiasang of this city have specially initiated a charity football match to raise relief funds. Taking advantage of the Hong Kong Star East Football Team's presence in Shanghai, they invited the team to face off against the city champion Qingbai Team again at the Lyceum. The match will begin at 5:30 PM. Star East previously lost 1-3 to Qingbai, and today is a good opportunity for revenge, so they will undoubtedly do their best to compete. Qingbai, in order to maintain their reputation, will also seek victory again.</p>
<p>Military Police and Constabulary All Mobilized</p>
<p>In order to show the importance of today's match, the initiator Du Yuesheng will personally perform the opening kickoff ceremony. The referee is Zhang Le, and the linesmen are Deng Xiaoliang and Huang Renyi. Tickets for the grandstand are divided into two types: 5,000 and 10,000 yuan. Special 20,000 yuan seats will be set up in the stadium. Long-term complimentary tickets issued by the Football Committee will be temporarily suspended. Sports journalists will be admitted with tickets, and military police will also need to purchase tickets. In order to maintain order in the stadium, the Garrison Command, the Military Police Corps, and the Municipal Police Department have been specially requested to dispatch a large number of military police to maintain strict security around the Lyceum and will absolutely not allow anyone to enter without a ticket. In addition to the Fuxing Middle Road gate, the Shaanxi South Road gate will also be opened at the entrance to the stadium. This is related to charity, and it is hoped that everyone will purchase tickets to save compatriots in need.</p>
<p>The lineups for Star East and Qingbai were announced yesterday by the responsible persons of each team and are recorded below:</p>
<p>Star East</p>
<p>Zhu Zhaoheng</p>
<p>Huo Yaohua, Hou Rongsheng</p>
<p>Luo Weiquan, Xu Jingcheng, Feng Kunsheng</p>
<p>Li Shuoyou, Liu Songsheng, Guo Yingqi, Zhang Jinhai, Deng Guangsen</p>
<p>(Reinforcements) Li Zhaorong, Feng Jingxiang</p>
<p>Qingbai</p>
<p>Qin Bigao</p>
<p>Yan Shixin, Wu Qixiang</p>
<p>Qu Yongfu, Meng Yiliang, Gao Baozheng</p>
<p>Cao Qiuting, Luo Shoufu, Li Yichen, Xu Wenkui, Fei Chunhua</p>
<p>(Reinforcements) Huang Shijie, Yi Che</p>
<p>Star East Team Adjusts Lineup</p>
<p>The Star East guest team's roster was personally adjusted and announced by team leader Hu. There is no change in the goalkeeper. The heavy responsibility of defense is entrusted to Huo and Hou. Captain Xu is stationed in the center, supplemented by Luo and Feng as midfielders, which is quite appropriate. The mystery players of the forward line, Li Zhaorong and Feng Jingxiang, are listed as reinforcements. If the situation changes, they may still play. Guo Yingqi showed his edge in the previous match against Hualian, and today he will still play as the center forward, paired with Liu Songsheng, Zhang Jinhai, Li Shuoyou, and Deng Guangsen, which is naturally tacit. Overall, today's formation is stronger in defense than offense.</p>
<p>Qingbai Team Well-Matched</p>
<p>Qingbai is the champion of this Shanghai football tournament and has an extraordinary demeanor. Moreover, last week, they defeated Star East 3-1. Their exquisite individual techniques and close teamwork are unmatched in Shanghai. Qin Bigao is in excellent condition recently. Yan and Wu are a pair of iron gates. Meng Yiliang and Afu Baozheng guard the central defense fortress, making it difficult for enemy cavalry to enter. Forward Gu Yiche has a short rest, and Luo Shoufu fills the left inner forward position. A Kui moves to the left. There are no other changes, and the strength will not be weakened. Therefore, when the two armies meet again today, there will surely be many tense and exciting moments.</p>

<h3 id="e114">Current Status of Educational Administrative Work <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>— Zhu Jiahua</p>
<p>Since the victory, the work of the Ministry of Education has mostly been focused on restoration and post-war recovery. Based on the resolutions of the National Teachers' Restoration and Post-War Conference held in Chongqing last September, the Ministry of Education must quickly redistribute the schools and cultural institutions that moved west reasonably. It must revitalize the schools in the recovered areas, eradicate enslaved education, and seek to provide every young student with a place to study. These tasks are naturally extremely difficult, and the problems are numerous.</p>
<p>(1) Student Enrollment Issues: In the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, education has made much progress in terms of its scale of development, and the number of students has greatly increased. Before the war, there were over 41,000 students in colleges and universities; now, the number has almost doubled. Before the war, there were over 620,000 middle school students; now, there are over 1,160,000, not including students in the recovered areas. Before the war, there were 18 million elementary school students; now, there are 25 million in the 19 provinces and cities in the rear alone. The number of students will inevitably increase greatly in the future. As we universally promote national education and as local autonomy progresses, elementary and middle schools will develop further daily. Just taking colleges and universities as an example, since the victory, we have established six temporary university refresher courses in the Northeast, accommodating over 13,000 students from colleges and universities during the enemy-puppet period. After the summer vacation, they will enter formal schools separately. The Youth Army was originally composed of students from colleges and universities and senior high school students. After being discharged from the military, they must return to school, numbering over ten thousand. The number of students admitted to various colleges and universities during the summer vacation is also estimated to be around ten thousand. In total, there will be at least tens of thousands of new college and university students this year. With the nearly 80,000 existing students, schools are already overcrowded. With the addition of tens of thousands more students, and high prices limiting school equipment, the difficulties can be imagined. The Ministry of Education and educational figures are making every effort to overcome these difficulties.</p>
<p>(2) Teacher Issues: At a time when the number of students is increasing rapidly, there is an even greater shortage of teachers. Among the 660,000 elementary school teachers in the 19 provinces and cities in the rear, only 40% have received teacher training or are certified. The proportion of qualified middle school teachers is also less than half. Although there are many people seeking teaching positions in cities, this is only a temporary and abnormal phenomenon. In the vast countryside or remote provinces, there is a great shortage of teachers. Because of this, we hold teacher training campaigns every year, and recently, we planned to increase the number of teacher training students by 500,000 in five years, in order to alleviate the shortage of teachers in elementary education. We have also changed the structure of university teacher training colleges. All students in liberal arts, science, engineering, and agriculture colleges who aspire to engage in education for life can register at the teacher training college, receive professional teacher training, and receive the same treatment as teacher training students, in order to increase the number of middle school teachers. As for the training of university teachers, it involves specialized knowledge and advanced research, which cannot be achieved overnight. One of the reasons we are not rashly adding many universities at the moment is the difficulty in finding teachers. We have only restored Beiyang University, Shandong University, and Anhui University, and created Lanzhou University. This year, we only plan to establish a foreign language specialty school to meet the demand for international workers, which the Ministry of Foreign Affairs strongly supports.</p>
<p>Because of the shortage of teachers in universities and colleges, the Ministry of Education encourages students who have completed their studies abroad to return to the country, providing them with living assistance and travel subsidies, hoping that they will return as soon as possible to serve domestic education.</p>
<p>The meager salaries of teachers are also one of the reasons for the reduction in the number of teachers. Naturally, it is difficult to raise the salaries of education personnel alone, but we are doing our best to pay attention to the welfare of teachers. In addition to their salaries, university professors receive 25,000 yuan in academic research funds per person. We are now planning to find a way to double this amount and have submitted a special request to the Executive Yuan, hoping to be approved. The salaries of middle school teachers vary from province to province. The Ministry of Education stipulates that the highest monthly salary for senior high school teachers is 300 yuan (basic salary), and the monthly salary for junior high school teachers is 220 yuan. All other allowances are paid according to local standards. This standard is higher than before the war. The salaries of elementary school teachers vary even more from place to place. The Ministry of Education stipulates that the standard should be three times the cost of personal clothing, food, and housing in the local area, hoping that all localities can do this in good faith. In summary, the fact that teacher salaries are insufficient to maintain a livelihood is the most troubling issue. In the past, many teachers have switched careers as a result. We must find a way to prevent this phenomenon from continuing and allow teachers to teach in peace.</p>
<p>(3) Studying Abroad Issues: Whether for training teachers or meeting the needs of national construction, studying abroad must continue. Moreover, the international changes since the war have been great, and academic progress has been astonishing. We must further understand Europe and the United States. It is essential for young students to go abroad for further study. Therefore, the study abroad plan should be improved, and the study abroad policy must continue. The number of students taking the public-funded study abroad examination this year is not large. There are only 120 government-funded students. In addition, there are 70 exchange students between France and China, and public-funded students from the Sino-British Education Fund Board. Study abroad majors are being prepared for the study abroad examination. The examination is currently underway for registration. The examination will also be opened soon. The education funding is far from meeting the actual needs. The central government has allocated 60 billion yuan for education restoration, which is not a small amount. However, when divided among several hundred units, the amount each unit receives is still insufficient. For example, Central University had 1,200 students before the war. Now it has nearly 5,000. The school buildings are greatly insufficient, and the original school buildings are dilapidated and need to be repaired. School equipment must be increased. This expense is considerable. Zhejiang University had less than 800 students before the war. Now it has more than 2,000, and the school buildings are not only insufficient, but three-fifths of them were destroyed. The buildings of Tsinghua University and Nankai University were heavily damaged. The situation in other schools is roughly the same. Using the restoration funds set in September of last year, including transportation, repairs, and Sichuan travel expenses, with prices having risen so much, it is even more insufficient. For the education restoration funds for the recovered provinces and cities, 1.225 billion yuan of emergency measures funds allocated by the Executive Yuan were distributed last year. This year, it has been approved to allocate 6.6 billion yuan from the provincial restoration funds for education restoration. Some provinces received 1.1 to 1.2 billion yuan, while others received 300 to 400 million yuan. It is really not enough to restore the schools and educational institutions destroyed by the enemy with this funding. The Ministry of Education once required all provinces and cities to fully restore education within one year after the enemy's surrender, but due to financial difficulties, it is feared that the expected progress will be difficult to achieve.</p>
<p>The Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration has promised to supplement the needs of agricultural, industrial, and medical departments with US$4 million, and is in talks to purchase them. The one million US dollar worth of books and equipment ordered by the Ministry of Education during the war, and the 200,000 to 300,000 volumes of books and periodicals donated by the Ministry of Education in England and the United States recently, are now beginning to arrive one after another. The science instrument manufacturing plants established by various provinces to manufacture science instruments for middle schools will also be given appropriate subsidies this year to increase their output. The most common and urgent need is the equipment of school classroom desks and chairs and student beds. In some provinces, schools have been in session for almost a year, and even desks, chairs, and bed boards are not complete. Students are standing in class and sleeping on the floor. This kind of practical situation, of course, affects the efficiency of education and must be remedied as soon as possible. The minimum equipment of schools must be completed in the shortest possible time.</p>
<p>In addition to the above four issues, the Ministry of Education is striving to solve and intensify its work. Regarding the improvement of the curriculum of various levels of schools, the Ministry of Education has long started to gather experts to discuss and prepare for revisions. School administration must be on track and strictly and carefully select principals. How to encourage private schooling is also being actively planned. In short, education is currently in need of many things. The revival of education is to improve the status quo while maintaining the status quo, and there is a lack of manpower, material resources, and intelligence. Please ask all comrades and colleagues in the education and cultural circles to offer valuable opinions to promote our century-old plan.

<h3 id="e115">Gold Prices Rise, US Dollar Calm <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>Hong Kong Dollar Still a Target for Hot Money Activities</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai gold market was steady and strong. The morning opened flat, and after opening, it showed a slight increase from 1.93 million, but when it rose to 1.95 million, there was pressure. The Central Bank also allocated 212 taels at a price of 1.94 million. After that, demand became scarce, and it hovered above 1.94 million until noon. In the afternoon, it slightly fell to 1.935 million. Overnight transactions were again hyped up to over 1.95 million, but transactions were still few. As a result, the closing price rose by 13,000 compared to the previous close. Ornaments were 10,600 yuan per gram. Refined silver did not change. Private interest rates ranged from 1.3 to 1.6 jiao. Miscellaneous banks had more demand, and interest rates were about 1.8 jiao.</p>
<p>The foreign exchange market for US dollars was stagnant and stable. The focus of the market in this port shifted back to Hong Kong (the Hong Kong newspaper Shen reported that the US dollar was 510 yuan, 4,9), which caused buying interest to be quiet. It rose slightly from around 2650 yuan in the early morning to around 2660 yuan, and remained at this price until the end. As a result, it was similar to the previous close. The Hong Kong dollar was initially flat and then stabilized. There were still transfers of funds to Hong Kong to absorb US dollars and US currency (calculated at an exchange rate of just under 2,500), which caused demand to exceed supply. As a result, it rose back by 8 yuan later. The Hong Kong exchange rate rose from 510 yuan to 530 yuan. The Indian exchange rate was 640 yuan. The British exchange rate was offered at 8,600 yuan, but there was no activity in the US exchange rate.</p>
<h3 id="e116">Public Bonds in a Standstill; Bulls Unwilling to Let Go; Scattered Shorts Still Covering <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>Public bonds were still traded by insiders. Cheap miscellaneous bonds continued to be bought by hot money out of curiosity, and were squeezed again with the unified "C" bonds. Due to the unwillingness of the major bulls to let go, scattered shorts were still covering sporadically. "C" bonds were called up from 750 yuan to over 850 yuan, and then became quiet. Most of the disputes in the industry are still delayed, forming a stalemate. The noon closing result was still more stable than the previous day, and miscellaneous bonds made further progress.</p>
<h3 id="e117">Yarn Prices Fall, Cotton Prices Rise <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market had a particularly strong reaction. Buying interest from the South China group had reached saturation and stopped buying, causing Double Horse to plummet by 100,000. The morning opening price was still at 1.589 million, but with few buyers, the industry lowered prices to sell, and the price gradually decreased. The 16-count and 20-count yarns of other brands also fell by 10,000 to 20,000. People's hearts were not too empty, and they were quietly waiting for customer sales to develop. According to the situation, the rise was too rapid the previous day, and the interruption of transactions and subsequent fall yesterday seemed to be a natural phenomenon based on the surplus or deficiency of supply and demand.</p>
<p>Yesterday, New York's US cotton telegrams continued to rise by 13 to 18 points, calculated at US$29.62 for the near term, US$29.83 for the far term, and US$30.23 for the Midling spot. Spot cotton transactions in this port were even better. Dasheng, Jiafeng, Zhenxin, and Shenxin No. 1 Factory all made purchases. Inter-flower number trading was also not quiet. Market prices were firm and strong.</p>
<h3 id="e118">Cotton Cloth Market Turns Positive, But White Cloth and Printed Cloth Decline <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>Grey cloth and drill were trending firm because demand from Sichuan, Tianjin, Guangdong, and other groups was still not weak. Because China Textile has not opened for ten days, the chips on the market are dry, and the momentum is even more positive. However, white cloth is gradually entering a declining path, and printed cloth sales are particularly sluggish. As a result, V-dragons and drills rose by 500 yuan to 1,000 yuan. At noon, China Textile Construction opened for sale of cloth, with a very large number of items. Grey cloth was 500 to 1,000 yuan higher than the previous time, and the rest was flat. Drill was still not supplied. The market situation rose another step in the afternoon.</p>
<h3 id="e119">Rainproof Cloth Sales Sluggish <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the price of ordinary double-sided rainproof cloth of various brands fell to 5,250 yuan per yard, and single-sided cloth sold for 4,250 yuan. Buyers' purchasing interest was still lazy, creating a situation of oversupply. Although it is related to the lack of rain in the recent period, it is also due to the abundance of products, the decline in quality, and the fact that it was initially raised too much. The Nanjing group's air force uniform sales are not good, which is its fatal blow.</p>
<h3 id="e120">Company Reorganization Extended to the End of the Year <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>[Our Report] The measures for reorganizing companies in the recovered areas were originally scheduled to end at the end of this month. Therefore, all of these companies are actively rushing to complete the process, and are convening shareholder meetings this month to resolve everything. It is learned that the Ministry believes that the deadline is too urgent, and the number of companies that have not completed the process by the deadline is very large. It has internally decided to extend the deadline by six months to the end of this year, and an official order will be seen soon.</p>

<h3 id="e122">Slight Drop in Rayon <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday in the rayon market, the Guang brand of No. 120 Heavenly Bridge opened at 1,840,000 yuan. It briefly rose to 1,860,000 yuan, then retreated to close at 1,820,000 yuan, the same as the previous day's price. Various miscellaneous brands were down by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Transactions in factory silk were quiet, with little fluctuation in quoted prices. Raw silk saw some activity yesterday, with prices ranging from 1,630,000 to 1,650,000 yuan. Fine silk fabrics such as Dacheng checkered crepe experienced a slight increase, reaching 5,150 yuan in the morning and rising by 100 yuan in the afternoon, slightly less than the 200 yuan increase of the previous day. Meiya quilt covers saw few transactions, with quoted prices around 1,510,000 to 1,520,000 yuan. Minsheng brocade satin saw 500 pieces transacted yesterday at a price of 24,000 yuan, but the factory still considered this below cost and was unwilling to sell more.</p>
<h3 id="e123">Sugar Prices Firm <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market was initially weak but later firmed, with little overall change. The guild's auction saw medium granulated sugar drop slightly by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan in the morning, initially set at 1,000,500 yuan to 1,000,450 yuan, then recovering to 1,000,600 yuan to 1,000,550 yuan, and rising to 1,000,900 yuan in the afternoon. Company warehouse receipts No. 22 sold for 1,000,600 yuan, and No. 20 for 1,000,500 to 1,000,450 yuan. Diaoging sold 70 packages at 920,000 yuan, Jianbing at 1,190,000 yuan, and branded Dianhua white sugar opened at 1,200,000 yuan. Xinghua red sugar was agreed upon at 1,000,550 yuan, totaling one hundred and several dozen baskets. No. 1 cotton white sugar was auctioned at 1,160,000 yuan, and raw sugar at 990,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The Taiwan Company's spot goods were still offered at 980,000 yuan, with over 2,000 packages allocated first. Goods en route were at 950,000 yuan. The allocation quota is expected to be decided today.</p>

<p>The first batch of new Qimen black tea, shipped by Zhenhe Tea Shop, arrived some days ago. Although buyers have inquired, no agreement has been reached due to unresolved negotiations between the parties. As for other varieties, holders are unwilling to sell cheaply. However, shops and trading houses on this street are well-stocked and do not need to replenish. Therefore, the situation is unusually quiet. According to industry insiders, the interest in Taiwan black tea and Mao tea in the Wuxi and Yixing areas has the potential to rekindle. If this happens, the market atmosphere will become lively.</p>

<p>After the rebound the day before, Chinese stocks saw a significant influx of speculative capital yesterday. Industry insiders were pleased, and stock prices rose considerably. Yong Yarns rose from 525 yuan to 558 yuan, Meiya from 3280 yuan to 3580 yuan, Jingfu from 2255 yuan to 258 yuan, Xinguang from 245 yuan to 280 yuan, Qin Xing had a low of 195 yuan and a high of 230 yuan. After reaching a high at noon, prices slightly retreated. Various small- and medium-sized unpopular stocks were scarce, showing progress. Blue-chip stocks also gradually recovered. As a result, popular large stocks continued to rise by about 70%, small stocks rose by 10%, unpopular small- and medium-sized stocks generally advanced by 10%, and blue-chip stocks stabilized.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks continued to trend upward, with buyers shifting their focus to undervalued stocks. Fluctuations remained narrow during the half-day, with minimal changes and no escape from the consolidation phase. Ultimately, paper stocks alone rose by 20%, steel stocks were average, and the rest rose by about 5%. Operators adopted different strategies, and the trend became slightly ambiguous. Xiangtai, which had already announced its liquidation, had no buyers at 5,000 yuan yesterday.</p>
<h3 id="e128">Sichuan Goods Hampered by Transportation <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>Export Industry Cables Request for Ship Allocations</p>
<p>Sichuan and Xikang export goods such as tung oil, bristles, raw silk, cattle and sheepskins, and medicinal materials have, since the victory, relied on wooden boats for transportation to Shanghai due to the lack of steamer transport, posing a significant risk. In recent months, steamers have been prioritizing the transport of Sichuan grain, further exacerbating the problem. As a result, Sichuan bristles and tung oil have been delayed for a long time. The local export industry has cabled the Chongqing Ship Allocation Committee of the Ministry of Communications, requesting the allocation of ship tonnage to facilitate the transport.</p>
<h3 id="e129">Glutinous Rice Trends Downward; Other Prices Remain Unchanged <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>Transactions in the rice market remained scarce yesterday. Rice shops obtained their supply from the Market Management Committee through allocation at a rate of ten dan per household, maintaining stable public sentiment. However, glutinous rice trended downward, with hundred-yuan prices at 49,000 yuan, a sharp drop of 9,000 yuan. Yin yuan was at 42,000 yuan, a drop of 7,000 yuan. Registered customer goods increased yesterday, totaling 1,264 packages and 50 shi, including 378 packages and 50 shi of Yangxian rice, 100 packages of Wuyou rice, 506 packages of brown rice, and 280 packages of milled Xian rice. Flour remained unopened. Bran continued to rise by over one hundred yuan. The oil market saw improved digestion and rose by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. Soybeans rose by 500 to 600 yuan. Broad beans were in high demand due to the resumption of operation of speculative shops, and high-quality goods continued to rise by 1,000 yuan, while mid-grade goods remained flat. Wheat from North and South China was moving but not vigorous. Corn and mung beans fell by 1,000 yuan. Bean cakes rose by 200 to 300 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e130">Purchase of 150,000 Dan of Japanese Cocoons; Japan Only Agrees to Sell Half; General Ge Jingzhong to Negotiate <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>The government previously negotiated with General MacArthur's headquarters to purchase 150,000 dan of Japanese autumn cocoons. It is reported that a reply has recently been received, with the Japanese side only agreeing to sell 75,000 dan. Our authorities believe this is insufficient for the silk mills in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. Ge Jingzhong, general manager of the China Sericulture Corporation, will travel to Japan to further negotiate with General MacArthur's headquarters, hoping to secure the full supply of the minimum quantity of 150,000 dan to maintain silk exports. It is reported that Mr. Ge will be accompanied by Director Zhou of the technical department of the company and will fly to Japan within days to conduct cocoon purchases and conduct an on-site survey of Japan's post-war silk industry to serve as a reference for improving China's sericulture.</p>
<p>It is also learned that the China Sericulture Corporation, in order to save expenses due to the early passage of the cocoon season, has instructed all cocoon collection points to expedite their closure. After closure, it plans to convene a meeting of those in charge of various points to review the cocoon collection business to improve the technical aspects of autumn cocoon purchases.</p>

<p>Summer woolen fabrics declined again yesterday. As the sales season has passed, shops are gradually selling off outdated stock. From the perspective of users, Western-style clothing businesses are trying their best to sell off their existing inventory, resulting in a market price reduction of 10,000 yuan per yard, without any actual buyers.</p>

<p>Transactions in the foreign market for bristles remain sluggish. Most of the bristles recently exported were those that had been previously transacted. Although the export volume this month is higher than last month, it is still for orders placed one or two months ago. Six hundred and fifty dan of Sichuan bristles were loaded yesterday and will be shipped to the United States within days.

<p>[United Press, Havana, 24th] According to an announcement by the Ministry of Agriculture, Cuba's total sugar production for this year is not expected to exceed 4,000,000 tons, approximately 500,000 tons less than previously anticipated.

<p>Switching Entirely to the Standard System and the Market System</p>
<p>The Weights and Measures Inspection Office sent an official letter, Zong Zi No. 272, to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, stating that the central government has long stipulated that the international metric system be the standard system for weights and measures in our country, supplemented by the market system, with a deadline for unified implementation. Since implementation, provinces and cities have successively followed suit, to the convenience of merchants and people. This city has suffered eight years of destruction under the enemy and puppet regime, and the administration of weights and measures has become chaotic again. While many comply with the statutory system, many still use the maritime foot, English yard, maritime peck, old scale, English pound, and Japanese scale. As this concerns national laws and the interests of the people, it is the duty of this office to send personnel to inspect each industry and eliminate non-compliant practices. To facilitate implementation, we request your chamber to inform all members to switch entirely to the aforementioned new system (i.e., the standard system and the market system) to comply with regulations.</p>

<h3 id="e138">Minister Gu Visits Yangzhou to Allocate Funds; Why Do the Old and Young Wander? When Will They Return Home from Starvation? <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>Special Correspondent Wang Gonghan, Yangzhou, 22nd</p>
<p>Since the news came that the National Government had ordered Minister of Social Affairs Gu Zheng to oversee relief efforts for refugees in northern Jiangsu, the general public in Yangzhou has had a simple feeling: the central government has not forgotten northern Jiangsu after all! This is a reflection of morale. The origin of this morale reflection, in a broad sense, is because the overall domestic situation after the victory has been a major headache for people; in an even broader sense, the successive "security" and "peace" conferences of the League of Nations have always been shrouded in unfortunate shadows, and people are always worried and fearful of a "third world war," which seems to be on the verge of erupting. People are not the same as they were before the eight-year war of resistance, and their understanding, analysis, and vigilance regarding the international situation have all improved. In a narrower sense, the environment in Yangzhou for many years has been one of outward relaxation and inward tension, with constant storms, and people have felt uneasy. Rice prices, like those in other places, even broke through the 60,000 yuan mark at one point.</p>
<p>Several Timely Rains; New Wheat Has Appeared</p>
<p>Fortunately, in the past two weeks, there have been several timely rains, and new wheat has appeared on the market. In addition, the Shanghai municipal government resolutely suppressed rice prices, which has also had some impact here. (Commodity prices in Yangzhou blindly follow Shanghai.) The rice price here has now retreated to the 50,000 yuan level.</p>
<p>Just as people were finding some small comfort in their disappointment, Minister Gu really came to Yangzhou and allocated 100 million yuan in funds and 230,000 bags of flour to Yangzhou, which greatly pleased people.</p>
<p>The refugees from various counties in northern Jiangsu who have fled to Yangzhou are not entirely satisfied with the amount of funds allocated to Yangzhou by Minister Gu, because according to the principles and methods of using the funds announced by Minister Gu, they must be used to improve refugee reception centers (such as repairing houses, doors, and windows) and to run civilian canteens, small-loan programs, and refugee medical institutions. In this way, the actual amount that can be distributed to each refugee can be imagined to be very little. However, the refugees also understand and trust: "The government's power can only do so much at present." Moreover, as Minister Gu said well: "A small amount of material assistance is certainly of no help, but as the saying goes, sending a goose feather from a thousand miles away shows the sender's good intentions."</p>
<p>Minister Gu Consoles; Refugees Weep Together</p>
<p>Therefore, the refugees are always grateful for the central government's remembering them. This is manifested in their behavior: prostrating and crying bitterly upon seeing Minister Gu. In the "Parliamentary Courtyard," when Minister Gu went to inspect and comfort the refugees on the morning of the 19th, everyone cried. At another refugee reception center, when Minister Gu went to inspect and comfort the refugees, Guo Rucheng, a Baoying refugee and graduate of Jinling University, saw Minister Gu, turned around and bowed, while complaining about his suffering: yesterday, he sold a small wall hanging to get through the day. These scenes made everyone who went to visit with him's eyelashes become moist.</p>
<p>Three-Year-Old Boy Sold for 500,000</p>
<p>That same evening, just as I returned home, my wife pointed to our third child, who was napping, and said to me with a smile: "There are people outside who are willing to sell a three-year-old child for 500,000 yuan. Would you be willing to sell him?" Then, she told me that someone from a Shanghai-based bank had sent someone to Yangzhou to sell a three-year-old boy. As a result, a poor refugee team sold the three-year-old child for 500,000 yuan. After listening to my wife's words, I looked at my own child, who was sleeping so sweetly, and deeply thought about the difficulties of the generally impoverished.</p>
<p>During the refugee registration process, there were phenomena of secretly impoverished people who were unwilling to register automatically. Therefore, the Yangzhou Office of the Northern Jiangsu Refugee Relief Association, which was established here not long ago, held a symposium on the morning of the 20th. The first issue discussed was how to find ways to persuade secretly impoverished people to register automatically.</p>
<p>Minister Gu came to Yangzhou on the 19th, and on the 20th, he went to Taixian with the chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial Government to inspect the area. It was reported that he returned to Zhenjiang and then to Shanghai on the 21st. This is equivalent to saying that the refugee relief efforts in this corner of Yangzhou and Taixian can be considered to have come to an end.</p>
<p>But in the reporter's mind, I cannot erase the words on a couplet inside a refugee reception center here: "The old and young, for whom do they wander? Enduring hunger and waiting for food, when will they return home?"</p>
<h3 id="e139">Ms. Bileks Comes From Xinjiang <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>Reporter Zhang Ming, Nanjing, 20th</p>
<p>Even today, when transportation is smooth and fast, we cannot help but feel a sense of remoteness when it comes to Xinjiang, which has already opened its doors! Xinjiang's area is equal to the total area of the nine northeastern provinces, which are closely related to us at present. It is fifteen times the size of Zhejiang, accounting for 14.690% of China's entire territory, totaling 1,641,554 square kilometers. The province also has the Pamir Plateau's Congling Mountains, known as the roof of the world, the Tianshan Mountains, which are said to have been traveled by the Tang monk Xuanzang when he went to fetch scriptures, and the ever-changing desert, allowing us to imagine. What a place that is enough to evoke stories of heroes and knights!</p>
<p>This time, taking advantage of the opportunity of the arrival of the National Assembly representatives from Xinjiang in Beijing, I made a long-awaited visit.</p>
<h3 id="e140">I Discovered Great Differences Between Us <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>A total of four people came: Ms. Bileks, a National Assembly representative from Xinjiang, Hua Shengmu, an executive member of the Xinjiang Provincial Party Headquarters and deputy director of the Department of Civil Affairs, Sadti Kushi, principal of the Dihua Municipal Women's Central School, and Wu Tiekuer, a translator for the National Assembly representative.</p>
<p>I knew in advance that I would not be able to communicate with them directly, so I first found the translator, Mr. Wu. Mr. Wu was tall and slender, wearing a Western suit, and looked no different from a Han Chinese. So I felt relieved and went to interview Ms. Bileks. However, at first sight, I was amazed. The differences between her and me were too great. She had white skin, large and round eyes, beautiful and long braids, and a healthy and strong physique. She wore Westernized clothing without any affectation. There was clearly nothing in common between her and me.</p>
<p>This visit was based entirely on my curiosity and novelty, so I did not ask her big questions, and I started with small questions first!</p>
<h3 id="e141">Talking About Small Problems; Hair, Cheongsam, Clothing Material <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>"Why is your hair so long?"</p>
<p>"Long hair is in fashion."</p>
<p>"Are there any short hairstyles?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"Your clothes are very beautiful. Isn't this style entirely foreign?"</p>
<p>"It doesn't matter if it's foreign. We just look at our trends. Whatever style is popular is the style we wear. This is the most popular now."</p>
<p>"Do you wear cheongsam?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"Where does the clothing material come from?"</p>
<p>"Mostly from the Soviet Union. There used to be British goods, but there are none now. However, Xinjiang can weave very good floral silk and also produce famous felt!" Ms. Bileks said happily, showing considerable pride.</p>
<h3 id="e142">Marriage System; Based Entirely on Religious Doctrine <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>Then I asked about the marriage system. She replied to the reporter:</p>
<p>"Our marriages are based on religious doctrine, which means that we cannot marry people of different faiths. As for other customs, we are now more free. According to etiquette, women cannot go out casually!"</p>
<p>At this time, Mr. Wu interjected to tell the reporter: "Representative Bileks is a director of the Xinjiang Provincial Women's Association!"</p>
<p>This woman is obviously very naive. She is only twenty-two years old, but she is also very capable. As the reporter listened to Mr. Wu's translation, she slowly began to write Chinese characters on the side with a pen. I thought this was increasing my interest. I asked her, "How can you write?" She smiled, and Mr. Wu answered for her, "Because there are many Han Chinese coming and going in the provincial capital, she often interacts with them and can also understand some Chinese. It is inconvenient to speak," and she can barely write characters like a student in the lower grades of elementary school. She is very clever. Obviously, after the reporter asked these small questions, she asked another question: "I heard that you do not welcome people from outside, is that true?"</p>
<p>She almost became anxious and mumbled a lot of flat, monotonous words, asking Mr. Wu to translate them to me. She said,</p>
<p>"This is not our opinion, and it has already passed. When Sheng Shicai ruled Xinjiang, he was like imprisoning us in a prison, constantly issuing a kind of terror policy. He was dictatorial and successively closed down 120,000 outstanding people, and he confiscated the property of ordinary people. All political and economic power was under his high pressure. Especially in the last year or two, he implemented a policy of assimilation and intermarriage, attempting to eliminate our Xinjiang ethnic groups. It was at that time that he did not welcome people from outside, because he did not want others to know about his cruelty. So if anyone went, he would harm them to prevent them from spreading the word."</p>
<p>Then, she said again:</p>
<p>"We have no power to refuse anyone from coming to Xinjiang."</p>
<h3 id="e143">The Yining Incident; First Gave Them Pain <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>Below, she told me how much pain the occurrence of the Yining incident had given them. She went on to say:</p>
<p>"Now, Chairman Zhang is very good. His arrival was able to peacefully resolve the Yining incident. We are grateful for Chairman Zhang's spirit of universal love. He is great."</p>
<p>From this, we know that in different faiths, we cannot force any of their behaviors.</p>
<p>I saw that she was speaking too nervously and angrily, so I changed the topic.</p>
<p>"If I go to Xinjiang, would you welcome me?"</p>
<p>"Welcome, and I hope you will come back with us this time!"</p>
<p>I liked her naivete and stayed for a long time before leaving. Finally, we mutually agreed to "see you again in Xinjiang!"</p>
<h3 id="e144">Desert Camel Caravans: How Much They Inspire Yearning <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>A story has enlightened me about Xinjiang. Besides the geographical barriers that naturally isolate it from the inland, considerable misunderstandings persist regarding religion and human relations. However, these misunderstandings are clearly diminishing today!</p>
<p>Xinjiang comprises seventy-nine counties with a population of over five million. Seventy percent of the population is engaged in agriculture, predominantly in Southern Xinjiang, where their influence is greater. Nomadic people constitute twenty percent, mainly in Northern Xinjiang, with the remainder involved in commerce and industry.</p>
<p>The region is rich in resources. In terms of minerals, there are gold, silver, copper, iron, lead, coal, petroleum, and jade. However, these resources are under government control, and plans for their development have yet to be fully implemented.</p>
<p>Furthermore, representatives say: "We have apples as large as teacups, sweet Hami melons, various fruits, and vegetables." Indeed, Xinjiang is a tempting name, and we demand to enjoy Xinjiang! To develop Xinjiang!</p>
<p>However, Xinjiang faces serious ethnic issues, serious religious issues, and serious language issues.</p>
<p>Their religions include Buddhism, Christianity, and Islam. Languages spoken include Turkish, Persian, Mongolian, Manchu, and Chinese. Written languages include Chinese, Uyghur, Manchu, and Mongolian. Ethnically, there are typically fourteen groups: Han, Manchu, Xibe, Solon, Mongolian, Chahar, Torghut, Uyghur, Kazakh, Kyrgyz, Tajik, Han Hui, Tatar, and naturalized Russians.</p>
<p>Among them, the Uyghur people are the most numerous, accounting for seventy percent of the total population, mainly residing in the south. Therefore, discussing ethnic issues today is not too daunting, as besides the large Uyghur group, all others are small subgroups.</p>
<p>I long for the camel caravans in the desert, for the precocious Turkish-style girls, and even more for the Hami melons, and for the teacup-sized apples.</p>

<h3 id="e145">Contradictory Siamese Mentality <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Hong</p>
<p>Bangkok, 18th (Airmail)</p>
<p>When Japan launched the Pacific War, Siam fell and was forced to participate in the so-called "Greater East Asia War," declaring war on the United Nations. After the restoration of peace, the United States was generous and tolerant, treating Siam with composure and without imposing any conditions. However, the British, with their stronger feudalistic mindset, were unwilling to relinquish their vested interests, considering Siam an enemy state and compelling it to sign a ceasefire agreement. Siam reluctantly agreed to pay a compensation of thirty million tons of white rice and five million pounds sterling in war expenses. Losses suffered by British residents in Siam due to war damage or Allied bombings were to be compensated or rebuilt by Siam. Furthermore, the export of timber produced in Siam required British approval after the agreement was signed. As British troops have not yet withdrawn, the Siamese people seem extremely troubled by the British, displaying an expression of helplessness. Towards the overseas Chinese, they retain their traditional mentality of extreme contempt. After Japan's surrender, they even carried out massacres of our compatriots over trivial matters, arousing public outrage in our country. Subsequently, a delegation was sent to China, where they witnessed the true situation of our country: vast in land and rich in resources, with a strong national defense. The people, in general, were elegant and polite, a stark contrast to the barefooted and half-naked laborers they saw in their own country. Only then did they recognize the true face of our country and realize that China was not to be trifled with. Upon their return, they propagated their impressions, and the Siamese people began to treat the overseas Chinese with less disdain than before. There is a growing hope for improved Sino-Siamese relations. However, it is still hoped that our compatriots will respect their own dignity and not lose the demeanor of a great nation, lest they be despised by foreign races.</p>

<p>Editor Guang Sheng: I am a soldier. I joined the army in my teens. After eight years of fighting, I earned victory with blood and sweat, and I also earned the rank of lower-ranking officer. Chairman has repeatedly instructed: "Nation-building is more important than resistance against Japan. We must bring the spirit of resistance against Japan to complete the great task of nation-building." True, even after victory, we are still constantly on the move, protecting our compatriots who have suffered in the depths of misery for eight years. This is our responsibility, and we are suffering, but we will not complain. But our suffering is unknown to anyone. We eat rationed rice that ordinary people have never tasted, and as for vegetables, let alone anything else, we eat whatever is cheap. We haven't had pork or fish in years. We don't even have mats to sleep on, just burrowing into straw. We have seen with our own eyes that there are many military supplies among the materials received from the enemy and puppets. Why can't they give us even one blanket? As for pay, privates get 900 yuan per month, privates first class get 1,050 yuan, and corporals get 1,200 yuan. They work hard for a month without being able to take a bath, eat a decent meal, or buy a pair of shoes. Good heavens! I lead over a hundred soldiers, and they are barefoot every day, unable to maintain their daily lives. How can the soldiers be at ease? I tell them every day that the superiors will definitely find a way to solve the problems of those of us who fought to the death. As a result, all we hear is "salary increase, salary increase," but the poor soldiers are still the same! As a captain, I currently receive a monthly living allowance of 45,000 yuan, 140 times my base salary, plus 8,000 yuan for food expenses, totaling 64,280 yuan (including vegetable money and firewood). With such high living expenses, making a suit costs over 20,000 yuan, and a pair of cloth shoes costs over 10,000 yuan. How can we afford to shave and bathe? And to make matters worse, after being separated from my parents for a full ten years, my fiancée and I fled from the "bandit area" last month. I managed to support them for a month, but now I really have no way! Heavens! I'm so desperate I want to commit suicide! I hope the newspaper can appeal on my behalf, asking the authorities to quickly resolve the suffering of us soldiers. From Yang Shiling of Yixing, June 17.</p>
<h3 id="e148">The Shanghai West Mounted Patrol is Effective <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>Editor: The Shanghai Police Bureau, in view of the serious security issues in the western suburbs of Shanghai, has ordered the patrol team to station in Shanghai IV to maintain security. A few days ago, the team sent a detachment leader, Xi Zunhan, with about fifty police officers to station in western Shanghai, at the former Annamese barracks at 648 Jianguo West Road. It is heard that they will also move towards the suburbs in order to control the security of the suburbs. Their mission focuses on nighttime, patrolling in shifts from 2 PM every day. Under the scorching sun, walking on the suburban Zhongshan Road and Hongqiao Road is indeed a difficult task. I see that every time they return from patrol, they are always covered in sweat, their clothes soaked through. They still smile and return to the camp with a pleasant mood, and they also do a horse drill every morning, energetic and full of vitality, which is admirable. Although the team has only been stationed for a short time, those elements who disrupt the public order have seen the brave warriors riding tall horses, constantly changing shifts for patrol, and dare not appear so recklessly anymore. I hope these warriors will not be half-hearted and will continue to do their work diligently. I also hope that the police bureau can station another unit in the suburbs of Zhabei and Nanshi. I believe it will be very effective in addressing security issues. From Zhou Xianlong, June 18.</p>

<p>A detailed plan will be released once relief strategies have been discussed.</p>
<p>To whom it may concern: I am a humble person. I lost my parents at a young age, leaving me lonely and helpless. I struggled for survival in society, striving for self-improvement, and fortunately avoided starvation and exposure. My wife and I often look back on the painful experiences of the past twenty years, and we are even more motivated to provide relief to the elderly, weak, widowed, and orphaned. I believe that there are many charitable organizations in Shanghai, and my efforts are limited, so I rarely donate to them. I have always admired your esteemed newspaper for its social services, and I dare to write this special letter requesting your help. If there are any lonely, widowed, and orphaned individuals who are unable to make a living, or any poor and sick individuals who are unable to afford medical treatment, who are indeed genuine cases, I am willing to provide them with direct assistance, a drop in the bucket, just to comfort my heart. If you are willing to accept my request, I hope you will reply in your newspaper so that I can take action. I am, with respect, Qingxia Elder.</p>
<p>[Editor's Reply] We have read your letter and are pleased to learn that you are willing to provide direct assistance to lonely, widowed, and orphaned individuals who are unable to make a living, or to poor and sick individuals who are unable to afford medical treatment. This demonstrates your kindness and compassion for those in need, and we are deeply touched! Regarding how to proceed, we respectfully request that you visit us in person to discuss the matter (any time in the morning or afternoon). As your original letter did not include your address, we are sending this reply through the mail. We pray for your response.</p>

<p>Legal Inquiries</p>
<p>(1) Kang Changle asks: To the Editor: I have a matter that I cannot resolve and would appreciate your guidance. "In the second year of the Republic of China, I mortgaged a house to Sha for 1,000 silver dollars. Now Sha wants to redeem it. Regarding the redemption price, some say it should be based on the price of goods in the second year of the Republic of China, some say it should be based on the current price of silver dollars, and some say it should be redeemed with 1,000 yuan of legal tender." In my opinion, the first option is too disadvantageous to the landlord, the third option is too disadvantageous to the tenant, and the second option is more reasonable. But I don't know how it should be resolved. Please advise.</p>
<p>[Lawyer Duanmu Kai replies] It can be handled according to Article 12 of the Supplementary Regulations for Handling Civil Litigation after Restoration.</p>
<p>(2) Zhu Zhengyong asks: I and my friend Jia previously opened a shop as partners, with Jia serving as manager. Since the victory, Jia has gone elsewhere and is said to be suspected of being a traitor. Later, I convened the other shareholders to discuss everything, and it was decided that I would be appointed manager and Jia's shares would be merged into friend Yi's shares. If the case is prosecuted in the future, will I be guilty? Will friend Yi be guilty? How should Jia's shares be disposed of to be legal and innocent? Please answer in your column.</p>
<p>[Lawyer Duanmu Kai replies] According to Article 688, Paragraph 1 of the Civil Code, if there is a legitimate reason, Jia can only be expelled from the partnership.

<p>Editor: I am a patient who needs long-term care, so my elderly father often takes a portion of his hard-earned salary to buy milk powder and similar things and asks someone to bring it from Shanghai. The other day, my father bought two pounds of loose milk powder because the American milk powder in the market was out of stock, costing 6,000 yuan. When I received it, I saw a hard lump like plaster in the paper bag. I thought it was caused by dampness. I cut some with a knife and tried to eat it, but it was starchy with a biscuit taste. I really don't know what it was made of! But the powder was very fine when purchased, and the color and smell were similar to the real product. After being deceived, I should like to borrow a corner of your newspaper to disclose it, to punish the abominable merchants, and to prevent the ignorant from being deceived again, I would be very fortunate! I wish you peace in writing. Zhu Zhiyan Respectfully.</p>

<p>— Shao Fu</p>
<p>Over three million refugees from Northern Jiangsu have fled to other places, with over 50,000 arriving in Shanghai daily. Some have already initiated the establishment of the Shanghai Fundraising Association for the Northern Jiangsu Refugee Relief Association. Before proceeding with this work, I would like to appeal to our fellow citizens in Shanghai to generously donate.</p>
<p>For the past eight years, the compatriots of Northern Jiangsu have been living in dire straits. There was no way to help them back when the enemy and puppets were entrenched there. Now that the war of resistance has been won, for them to continue suffering from family destruction and displacement is something the compatriots of Northern Jiangsu feel very angry and wronged about. Even those of us who are not in this situation feel very angry as well. The reason is simple: there is no reason for them to suffer this pain, and there is no value in suffering this pain.</p>
<p>Therefore, in addition to launching a large-scale emergency relief movement today, we should actively seek a thorough solution from the root for the more than three million refugees from Northern Jiangsu who are displaced elsewhere. Otherwise, our relief efforts will lose their meaning and will not achieve satisfactory results.</p>
<p>What is the most fundamental way to help the refugees from Northern Jiangsu?</p>
<p>"Returning home."</p>
<h3 id="e154">Shanghai University Students and Chongqing University Students <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Shanben</p>
<p>Now that the restoration has begun, and universities from the rear areas are relocating to Shanghai and Nanjing, students from both places are unfamiliar with each other's backgrounds, causing many to worry about future coexistence and cooperation. After returning to Shanghai from Chongqing, classmates and friends like to ask for my opinion on the students from both places. It is difficult to make a general statement on this point. In Chongqing, I heard (just heard) that after Jiaotong University students arrived in Shanghai, there was a distinction between Chongqing and Shanghai, clearly drawing an insurmountable gap. In essence, students from both places do have their own characteristics, but these differences are not insurmountable, as long as we thoroughly understand where these differences lie. Based on my personal observations, I will list the differences below:</p>
<p>(1) Age of Students: Students in Chongqing come from all directions, either trekking through the war zones or fleeing from other places. Many have delayed their studies, and some have graduated from high school but are unable to afford further education, so many have worked outside for several years before entering university. Therefore, the average age of university students in Chongqing is higher than in Shanghai. The average age of students entering university is generally over twenty, while in Shanghai, it is most common to be eighteen or nineteen, and there are even those who are sixteen or seventeen. Personally, when I was in Shanghai, I was considered to be in the middle to upper range of my classmates' ages, but in Chongqing, I was the youngest of the eleven in our dormitory (dormitory mates were mostly from the same class), with the oldest being five or six years older than me.</p>
<p>(2) Quality of Environment: Studying at a university in Shanghai is somewhat luxurious. Children from ordinary impoverished families do not dare to harbor this extravagant hope, so Shanghai university students live a more comfortable life. On the other hand, most university students in Chongqing are far from their hometowns, without support, and rely on public funds to make a living.</p>
<p>(3) Acuteness of Political Perception: Chongqing is the political center, and the movements of the world and the progress and retreat of the country are well understood. In particular, newspapers and magazines of various parties and factions and various colors are filled with information. In this environment, university students who care about national affairs can observe, analyze, compare, and synthesize, and have a clearer understanding of the political situation.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Shanghai was controlled by the enemy and puppet forces in the past, and the life of the university was barely surviving under close watch. It was difficult to have political activities, and even more accurate reports were difficult to obtain, so the atmosphere was naturally different.</p>
<p>Based on the above three differences, the conclusions we have reached are as follows:</p>
<p>Most of the university students in Chongqing, apart from the natives of Sichuan, have struggled out of the edge of death. They are older and know the value of knowledge and the vicissitudes of life. Because they study hard, they are naturally willing to put in more effort. Last July, when a ferryboat capsized at Fudan University, three students were tragically drowned. They were all authors, and especially one student from the Department of Foreign Languages, had published and unpublished works and translations totaling more than one million words. With two years of hard work in university, he was able to achieve such results. Even if it was crudely made, the diligence is imaginable. Because they are economically strapped, they rarely go out and only seek to keep their bodies warm in terms of clothing, with no extravagance. Therefore, they can be quiet and study diligently.</p>
<p>However, their response to politics is not so silent. Often one school can represent a social organization, carrying banners of various colors, shouting slogans of various parties and factions, attacking and scolding each other. Their clearer understanding of politics is a strength, but the disruption caused by a small number of stubborn and unscrupulous elements who take the opportunity to cause trouble, incite incidents, and destroy the harmony that a university should have is indeed a great regret.</p>
<p>As for Shanghai, the environment is harsh, and the youth are in this warm and splendid cradle of the city. Who can remain unmoved? Thus, they are inevitably distracted from their studies.</p>
<p>A great advantage of Shanghai university students is also a shortcoming of Chongqing university students, that is, the latter are old in the world and often have too much hypocrisy and pretense, while the former are younger, more enthusiastic, willing to do things, and willing to sacrifice. However, Shanghai students' attention to fashion and decoration and their pursuit of vanity are a major obstacle on the path of learning.</p>
<p>Finally, I believe that university students in both places have their own strengths and weaknesses. As long as they can be tolerant and understanding of each other, and in their interactions, give up their shortcomings and take their strengths, a happy and harmonious atmosphere can be created.</p>

<h3 id="e157">On the Ye Family Garden <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Rongbang</p>
<p>In the sweltering summer, when it is stiflingly hot, everyone wants to go to a cool summer resort. Places like Huangpu Park, Zhongzheng Park, and Hongkou Park in Shanghai are crowded with bustling tourists. The purpose of these people going there is simply to breathe some fresh air, enjoy the coolness, and invigorate their spirits.</p>
<p>As for the Ye Family Garden, it is only a few miles from the city. If you take a car, you can reach this "Summer Paradise" in less than fifteen minutes. Of course, I have already visited it once. You ask what my impression is? Well, let me say a little.</p>
<p>Couples, hand in hand, whisper sweet nothings among the flowers and plants; you can tell by their reluctant expressions.</p>
<p>Beautiful "young ladies" sit by the pond learning to fish, and when they see someone catch a big fish, they are overjoyed!</p>
<p>There are many fish in the pond, swimming back and forth on the surface of the water. Armed comrades shoot at the pond, and those they hit weigh about a pound. If someone picks it up and takes it home, they can have a good meal!</p>
<p>The pond water is very deep, but unfortunately, it is "stagnant water," too dirty! Otherwise, you could go for a swim, because Shanghai doesn't have such a large swimming pool. I think: if it could be changed to "flowing water" in the future, then the garden would become more lively!</p>
<p>If someone were to organize "summer camps," "summer tutoring classes," or "reading groups," I think it would be great to set them up here. Because there are clear bird songs, lush forests, and bright wildflowers. This can cultivate your temperament. Tao Yuanming loved flowers, plants, and trees very much, and that is the reason why modern people can "excerpt" this point and learn it.</p>
<p>The oily green grass grows vigorously on the flat ground, swaying in the breeze like a large green carpet, inviting the weary to lie down and take a nap.</p>
<p>The "cuckoo" bird calls on the cypress branches, as if it is specially waiting to "welcome" and "farewell"—tourists alike. This adds to the liveliness of the garden!</p>
<p>There are several "pavilions" and several "rockeries" and several artificial "underground caves" in the garden. These "underground caves" really resemble the "air raid shelters" of "Chongqing" during the war, and it is indeed a bit cool and chilly inside!</p>
<p>However, there are shortcomings. Some places in the garden are very messy and not well-maintained, not as clean and beautiful as the city parks. Several pavilions are already falling into disrepair!</p>
<p>It is said that this garden was built by the late Central Committee member, Mr. Ye Chucang. He dedicated his life to the party and the country, and died of overwork. It is a great pity! Now that he is dead! We hope that prominent figures in society will donate funds to renovate this "scenic" garden!—on the one hand, to commemorate him, and on the other hand, to allow tourists from afar to come and visit and admire—this "summer sanctuary"!</p>

<p>— Wang Deyun</p>
<p>Do you think "Calling Brother" (referring to a cricket) only eats vegetarian food? Not necessarily!</p>
<p>Once, I jokingly put a grasshopper into the "Calling Brother" cage. Unexpectedly, the "Calling Brother" inside suddenly pounced with fangs and claws, biting the head of the grasshopper in one go, and immediately chewed loudly, "kuo kuo" sound. The poor grasshopper, its wings and feet fluttered wildly, looked extremely painful.</p>
<p>This time, I was stunned! My body couldn't help but feel half cold! I sighed and said: Alas, you can know the face of an insect, but not its heart!</p>
<p>Really, even the heart of an insect is unknowable, let alone the heart of "all things party"?</p>
<p>Friends, beware of high-sounding demagogues!</p>

<p>In mental sanatoriums, there are many patients with outstanding artistic talents, such as sculpture, painting, and music. These talents sometimes do not disappear because of mental illness.</p>
<p>For example, the great composer Robert Schumann died in a mental hospital, but he continued to create masterpieces even after he developed significant mental illness. The 18th-century poet William Cowper wrote exquisite poems in a mental hospital. The New York State Hospital displays some beautiful sculptures that are the posthumous works of a master sculptor who was insane.</p>

<p>— Wuling Ren</p>
<p>The Fujian Provincial Government has approved the Xiamen Municipal Government's measures for publicly managing prostitutes and collecting fees. These fees will be used to improve the salaries of civil servants. In other words, the livelihood of civil servants depends on the efforts of prostitutes. It is indeed a bit...no wonder civil servants have a feeling of both laughter and tears upon hearing the news.</p>
<p>I once heard a story: "A ship full of grain floated out to sea, but because it forgot to bring fire, it could not cook, and the entire ship starved to death." According to a recent Reuters dispatch from Argentina, Argentina could have exported even more grain, but due to a lack of fuel and a severe shortage of tires, transportation was inconvenient, so it had to burn grain instead of fuel. From this, we can see that any valuable thing in the world becomes useless or unusable when it cannot function.</p>
<p>Someone may say: China is experiencing a famine in various places, and people are gnawing on tree bark to relieve hunger. If transportation were convenient, China and Argentina could exchange grain for fuel, which would benefit both sides.</p>
<p>A Reuters dispatch from London: Miss Ding Siter of Lee, wrote to US Ambassador Harriman, volunteering to test atomic bombs instead of animals suffering. What an admirable young lady! Your heart is compassionate enough. But how can the authorities bear to accept your request? I believe you can gain the nickname "Atomic Miss" from this. Isn't the name "Atomic" for a young lady the most fashionable thing today? This should be congratulated for you!</p>

<h3 id="e161">Pan Sanxing's Residence—I Wonder What It Is Used For Now <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>— Feng Yi</p>
<p>During the enemy's occupation, Pan Sanxing ran racecourse gambling halls and was the backstage boss of football teams, living a very exciting life. At the same time, he also owned a tall building, which was the most exciting part of his exciting life. This mansion was the famous 201 Jubo Rice Road, with the pseudonym Pan Xing written in the commonplace book. Speaking of this mansion, after Pan Sanxing's repeated renovations, the interior was truly magnificent and extremely exciting. The dance floor and stage were fully equipped, and it could accommodate two to three hundred people, with room to spare. The entire building required seven telephones to maintain communication, and it often needed twenty "boy" to manage the various rooms. At that time, among the private residences in Shanghai, its grand scale and luxurious layout could be said to be second to none. After the victory, Sanxing was arrested, so his ill-gotten property became the most interesting thing for everyone. It was once rumored that the mansion would be allocated as Marshall's residence, but because Ambassador Ma did not have time to stay in Shanghai for a long time, it was changed to other uses. Nowadays, everyone is panicking and clamoring for housing shortages all day long. If we can truly follow President Chiang's principle of resolving the housing shortage, limiting each person to 100 square meters, then people like you and me are qualified to occupy a seat inside. In fact, the housing shortage in Shanghai is not as serious as the common people imagine. There is more than one such mansion on the Shanghai Bund. So, when it comes down to it, the problem is that there are too many agencies coming to Shanghai and too many officials, so you get a building, and I get a building, and there will never be enough to distribute. Even A Mao's grandfather took a building, and A Mao's mother's brother also took a building. Some officials who are stationed thousands of miles away also come to Shanghai to get a few mansions as official residences, leaving only one or two "old family members" to watch the door. Under these circumstances, you and I, the little people, have to sleep in pigeon cages and on the side of the road.</p>

<h3 id="e162">Atomic Bomb—First Lands on the Surface of the Sea <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>— Jianan</p>
<p>In early July, the world's attention will be focused on a group of remote islands in the Pacific Ocean. The joint atomic bomb test conducted by the US Army and Navy will be launched there with earth-shattering force.</p>
<p>Vice Admiral Landy, commander of the First Joint Special Task Force and commander of the US atomic bomb test (please refer to the bronze image on the right), wrote an article on this matter, published in the June 8th issue of "Collier's" Weekly. He explained the details of the US preparations for the atomic bomb test, except for the parts related to national defense secrets, in great detail. Now, let's excerpt the main points below.</p>
<p>The United States plans to conduct three atomic bomb tests. The first atomic bomb will be dropped in the air and explode hundreds of feet above the water surface. Below is a fleet of ships of various types. Scientists expect the power of the explosion to be as fierce as that unleashed in Nagasaki, but no one can predict the results. The purpose of the experiment is also here. The one held in early July is just the first.</p>
<p>Two more tests will be held after this, with dates yet to be determined. In the second test, an atomic bomb will be detonated slightly below the water surface in the center of a fleet of ships. It is expected that the waves raised at that time will reach a height of one hundred feet, generating a hurricane with a speed of one thousand miles per hour, and the temperature will be calculated in tens of millions of degrees. We also want to know what impact various ships will suffer under such circumstances.</p>
<p>Explosion in Water—Huge Impact on the Earth</p>
<p>In the third test, an atomic bomb will be detonated half a mile deep in the ocean below the ships. To date, we can assume that we know nothing about the situation of an atomic bomb exploding deep in the ocean. We have no idea what the results will be. The purpose of the experiment is to explore the impact of the explosion on submarines and other ships in the test area. But one thing worth considering is that an atomic bomb exploding in the water may cause a continuous chain reaction in the seawater or cause radioactivity. There are indeed many people in the world who worry that the unlimited chain reaction of seawater may blow up the entire earth into ashes. But scientific experts believe that this will not happen.</p>
<p>After the results of these tests are determined, we can further know how to improve the defense aspect when building warships in the future, and we can be fearless about the power of atomic bombs. We can also know what impact atomic bombs have on aircraft in the air, as well as tanks, artillery, and other military equipment, and then provide appropriate protection.</p>
<p>In order to conduct the atomic bomb test, an appropriate location must be selected. This location should be within the scope of US control, at least five hundred miles away from the mainland, and the terrain, climate, and wind direction must meet the conditions of the test. We have searched dozens of locations in the Atlantic Ocean, the Caribbean Sea, and the Pacific Ocean, but they were rejected due to shallow water, too many people, or unreliable climate. In the end, Bikini Atoll in the Marshall Islands was selected.</p>
<p>Bikini Island is about twenty-one miles long and eleven miles wide. The many small coral islands around it are distributed like a necklace, with a blue sea in the middle. The island has only more than one hundred and sixty residents. At the same time, in gratitude to the US military for liberating them from the tyranny of the Japanese army, they voluntarily moved away from the island and went to Rongirik Island, one hundred and thirty-five miles to the east. In addition, the climate and wind direction on Bikini Island are relatively less variable.</p>
<p>Seventy Warships—Sacrificed for the Experiment</p>
<p>A total of seventy ships are prepared to be sacrificed in this test, including battleships, aircraft carriers, destroyers, submarines, cruisers, landing craft, transport ships, and all kinds of ships. At the same time, in order to test the power of atomic bombs against German and Japanese warships, the German heavy cruiser "Prinz Eugen" and the Japanese dreadnought "Nagato" are also included. Aircraft, tanks, trucks, mortars, jeeps, self-propelled artillery, radar, and radio equipment will also be placed on the decks of the ships to test the extent to which atomic bombs can destroy the weapons of the army and marines. There are also mannequins, uniforms, gas masks, ammunition belts, canned rations, etc. Everything is complete.</p>
<p>Of course, there cannot be a single human being within ten miles around, but we believe that it is necessary to study the reaction of atomic bombs on living things, so some ships are equipped with animals such as rats, sheep, and pigs.</p>
<p>According to reports from oceanographers and meteorologists, we have built steel-concrete observation posts in the safest places, equipped with the most sensitive cameras. The ships of the First Joint Special Task Force began to gather from late May and set anchor in Bikini Island Harbor. The B-29 aircraft of the 509th Composite Air Group will take off from the Kwajalein Island base and patrol the target area to conduct exercises. It was this group of aircraft that dropped the atomic bombs on Japan.</p>
<p>On the day of the atomic bomb test, there were about 30,000 people involved in this work. In advance, everyone must stick to their posts to ensure that nothing goes wrong. The atomic bomb will generally be dropped in the morning, assuming that the climate must be absolutely clear, so that the bomber can prepare to drop the bomb without the slightest mistake.</p>
<p>At about 9:30, fighter planes and bombers will fly over the target area at different altitudes. These aircraft are controlled by radio in order to test the radioactivity that is distributed in the air when the atomic bomb explodes. Whether these aircraft can "escape" is certainly a big question, but they must try their best to fly back to the base.</p>
<p>The First Experiment—Costs 500 Million US Dollars</p>
<p>At the same time, a Superfortress carrying an atomic bomb will take off from the Kwajalein Island base, step by step, to fly to a height of 30,000 feet, and then open the bomb bay and drop the bomb on the target area. At that time, there will be a flash of light that is unimaginable to humans. Those engaged in observation work must wear special protective glasses, even those who are more than ten miles away are no exception. The column of smoke created by the atomic bomb will rush into the sky, reaching a height of about 30,000 feet, like an enormous umbrella. The tragic situation inside this giant umbrella can only be compared to the "destruction of the world" described in the Bible.</p>
<p>At the time of the atomic bomb explosion, in addition to the radio-driven aircraft flying in the middle, there will also be radio-driven small boats shuttling around the harbor, measuring the radiation at each stage of the experiment. After a considerable amount of time, the first batch of investigators will go to the restricted area under the protection of special equipment to check the bombing situation of aircraft carriers, battleships, small boats, as well as tanks, gas masks, canned rations, sheep, pigs, rats, and other items. All the animals that have been killed by the bombing will be immediately loaded into refrigerated boxes and sent to the laboratory to study, diagnose, prevent, and treat the Japanese so-called "atomic disease." Fish experts will begin to study the tragic situation of marine life in the Bikini area that was "dragged into the disaster." After gathering reports from all parties, the Joint Chiefs of Staff in Washington will conduct a comprehensive study, and the parts that are deemed publishable will be reported to the curious and concerned public around the world.</p>
<p>The cost of these tests is certainly enormous. According to informal estimates, it is roughly around 500 million US dollars.</p>
<p>All thinking people in the world hope that atomic bombs will no longer be used as weapons, and we deeply sympathize with this sincere wish. Our army and navy leaders unanimously hope that the politicians of all countries will soon be able to guarantee that mankind will achieve lasting peace and maintain world order with laws. But before this goal is reached, the armed forces of the United States have a major responsibility to fully study the performance of various weapons, so that they can be fearless in national defense.</p>

<p>— Compiled and Translated by Junmo</p>
<p>Two atomic bombs swiftly brought this brutal war to an end, but also, because of the atomic bomb, suspicion among the world's great powers has intensified, causing them to be filled with anxiety. One atomic bomb in Hiroshima destroyed seventy percent of the city, causing 300,000 casualties. How can an atomic bomb, as small as a golf ball, possess such terrifying power? To answer this mystery, we must first understand what exactly an atom and atomic energy are.</p>
<p>An atom is the smallest structural unit of all matter in the universe, called "Atom" in English. This word comes from Greek, meaning "indivisible." Ninety-four types of atoms have been discovered so far. They are arranged in order of their weight, with the hydrogen atom being the lightest, ranked first, and uranium, the raw material for making atomic bombs, ranked ninety-second. There are three main materials that make up an atom: electrons, protons, and neutrons. An electron is a tiny particle with a fixed amount of negative electric charge. A proton is a tiny particle with a positive electric charge equal to the electron's electric charge. A neutron has no electric charge. Although the true structure of an atom cannot be seen with a microscope, based on the precise experiments and deductions of many scientists, we can know that the interior of an atom is a nucleus composed of protons and neutrons, surrounded by a group of constantly rotating electrons. This situation is roughly similar to the sun and the planets revolving around it.</p>
<p>Speaking of the atomic nucleus, it is the most important part of this problem. The basic structure of the atomic nucleus is protons and neutrons, which we have already mentioned above. Protons carry positive electric charges. When squeezed together, they will not only not get along, but also repel each other. As for neutrons, they do not carry any electric charge, so although they will not repel each other, they will certainly not attract and combine. However, in fact, the atomic nucleus is a thing with very strong binding forces, and it is very difficult to break it down. So, where does this huge binding force come from? According to years of hard work by many scientists, we finally know that this strong binding force is not electrical force at all, but only takes a small part of the mass of neutrons and protons. Once protons and neutrons form an atomic nucleus, they sacrifice several units of mass to be used for the energy required for binding. The mass sacrificed due to this binding is called "mass defect." Interestingly, this loss of mass is not a waste. As long as it is possible to find a way to break the atomic nucleus, then the atomic energy exchanged for a small amount of mass sacrificed when the atomic nucleus splits can be released. Roughly speaking, if the atomic energy hidden deep within the atomic nuclei in a cup of water is completely released, it would be enough for a large ocean liner like the Queen Mary to travel around the world.</p>
<p>So, the current problem is only how to break the atomic nucleus and release atomic energy. Scientists have been studying this problem for many years, going through many failures and improvements. Finally, they implemented the use of uncharged neutrons to break the atomic nucleus. Fortunately, we also discovered that when a uranium atomic nucleus splits, it not only releases a huge amount of energy, but also has new neutrons flying out. These new neutrons then bombard other uranium atoms, releasing more energy and flying out more new neutrons. The principle of the atomic bomb is nothing more than using the huge atomic energy released when the uranium atomic nucleus is broken. The huge heat of the sun is also due to the atomic energy released when the atomic nucleus splits.</p>
<p>Such huge and precious atomic energy exists so abundantly in the universe. If it is used in constructive work, it can advance human civilization by leaps and bounds. But if atomic energy is unfortunately used in destructive warfare, then the entire world will be reduced to ashes.</p>
<p>At 8:16 a.m. on August 6th of last year, the first atomic bomb exploded over Hiroshima, uprooting most of the city, and the number of casualties reached over 300,000. The places bombed by the atomic bomb are so barren that even grass cannot grow, turning into a wasteland.</p>
<p>An exploding atomic bomb is like a ball of fire, its central temperature reaching ten billion degrees, which is about 10,000 times stronger than the heat generated by an ordinary bomb explosion. This temperature, which is hotter than molten iron pouring out of a smelting furnace, can turn everything it touches into ashes. Not only that, but the explosiveness of an atomic bomb is also different from that of any other explosive. It also generates a force called light pressure. Originally, sunlight or lamplight also have pressure, but because it is too small, we don't notice it much, but scientists have already calculated this pressure in the laboratory. Here, we don't need to cite any mathematical formulas, but roughly speaking, the light pressure generated by an atomic bomb explosion will be 1,000,000,000,000,000 times greater than the pressure of an ordinary bomb. Such an amazingly large pressure will not only make it impossible for humans nearby to survive, but also cause huge storms, climate changes, and continuous large and small earthquakes in the months or even years that follow.</p>
<h3 id="e165">In the Atomic Age, the Navy Moves to Undersea Operations: Admiral Nimitz's View <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>— Jianan</p>
<p>Admiral Nimitz's views are very pertinent. He absolutely does not admit that the navy is useless, but admits that in the atomic age, the navy must implement revolutionary changes. The power of the atom is indeed amazing, but before its use is fully determined, immediately advocating the cancellation of the navy is an irresponsible argument.</p>
<p>The atomic bomb test to be held in the Bikini Islands on July 1 is aimed at the question of "what is the impact of the atomic bomb on the navy." All reforms will be carefully considered based on the results of this experiment, and no conclusions can be drawn yet. However, from a general point of view, there are already some signs to be found.</p>
<p>According to the opinions of general experts, the future navy may partially or even completely operate underwater. Nimitz also agreed with this point.</p>
<p>Once the navy emphasizes underwater operations, submarines will obviously occupy an important position. Nimitz said: In today's world where radar detectors are widely used, whether it is ground defense equipment or aircraft in the air, they cannot escape this "mysterious eye." Only submarines traveling underwater are not easily detected. Therefore, if you use submarines to launch atomic rockets near the enemy's coast or transport troops to land, you can achieve the effect of "surprise attack." Furthermore, although the power of atomic bombs in deep water is still unclear because it has not been tested, according to ordinary academic speculation, its destructive range is roughly smaller than in the air, although the shock force is much greater. According to the opinions of some American submarine personnel, the only warships that can exist in future atomic wars are submarines. This statement is not without reason.</p>
<p>However, the American submarine fleet, which has already exerted great power in the First World War, still has many shortcomings in its structure. If the current submarines are applied to atomic warfare, they obviously cannot be competent. In fact, until the last few months of the Second World War, the submarines of various countries in the world were not ships under water, but ships on the water, because they lurked underwater for a very short time, and most of the time they were still on the surface of the water for reconnaissance, or occasionally engaged in combat for a while. When submarines travel on the surface of the water, they are powered by internal combustion engines, but once they sink to the surface of the water, the internal combustion engines must stop working due to lack of air, and the power is entirely supplied by storage batteries, which is not only short in time, but also greatly restricted in speed. For example, the maximum speed of American standard submarines in water is only eight knots per hour. If it travels at two knots per hour, it can lie dormant for about forty hours. If it does not move at the bottom of the sea, it can last for sixty hours, but this is not combat, but hiding.</p>
<p>But in the "Navy of Tomorrow," the importance of the position occupied by submarines has generally become a conclusion.</p>
<h3 id="e166">How to Defend Against Atomic Bombs? Not Fighting Anymore is the Smartest Way <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>— Translated by Junmo from "One World" Magazine</p>
<p>Do we have any way to defend against the terrible atomic bomb? First, we might think: Is it possible to find a way to detonate the atomic bomb at a very high altitude, so that the ground will not suffer damage? The atomic bombs dropped over Japan exploded in the air about 1,500 feet above the ground. The bomb is either equipped with a barometer fuse device, which makes it detonate automatically at a certain height, or it uses a radar meter, which emits radio waves and controls a certain time by reflecting the waves from the ground or the sea surface. When the bomb is at a very high altitude, where our measuring instruments cannot reach, we are certainly helpless. If it has reached a considerable height and it uses a radar meter, then we may be able to find a way to use radio waves to make it detonate early. But even if this is successful, the detonation of the bomb will still cause damage to the ground. Moreover, if it uses a barometer meter instead of a radar meter, then we are simply helpless.</p>
<p>We have almost no practical and effective way to deal with the atomic bomb that is already approaching. The missiles used by the Germans to attack England before the end of the European war are an example.</p>
<p>In July 1944, when missiles began to attack England, 35 percent of them reached London. In the end, only 9 percent could slip through the net, but that 9 percent was already overwhelming for the British.</p>
<p>Since there is nothing we can do about the atomic bomb itself, we can only try to deal with enemy planes carrying atomic bombs, hoping to destroy them at a very distant location so as not to affect important urban targets. In terms of reconnaissance, the current application of radar can detect a bomber within 200 miles and below 40,000 feet in any weather. But to do this, taking the United States as an example, at least 50,000 people in the country must be responsible for radar reconnaissance to be of any use, and this reconnaissance must be continuous 24 hours a day, every minute and every second. Month after month, year after year, can a country's finances afford to maintain such a huge amount of talent and financial resources to do this work? For the defenders, every minute and every small place cannot be relaxed, but the attackers can randomly choose that day, that place becomes.</p>
<p>Even if we know that enemy planes are coming from 100 or 200 miles away, what can we do to shoot them down one by one? Anti-aircraft guns and fighter planes have proven to be old-fashioned and useless in this war. Future aircraft must be unmanned aircraft controlled by radio, and their speed is so high that no manned fighter plane can catch up. Due to the high speed, it is also extremely difficult to hit them with anti-aircraft shells. The only way we can think of is to invent a very high-speed firing projectile, controlled by radar, so that it can automatically and accurately fly towards the aircraft and destroy it. In fact, this method is probably already under research by scientists.</p>
<p>But even if this invention is successful, how can we be sure to shoot down all the attacking enemy planes in one fell swoop, without missing a single one? Modern warfare is completely unexpected, and the number is so large and the scale is so large that you cannot prevent a few from slipping through the net. And just a few, just once, is already a decisive destruction.</p>
<p>Unless mankind can be smart and never go to war again. Otherwise, mankind can be said to be completely helpless against this terrible atomic bomb.</p>
<h3 id="e167">Atomic Bombs in Rockets <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>According to the general opinion in the United States, the most important weapons in the future if war breaks out are atomic bombs and rockets. There is no need to elaborate on the power of atomic bombs. As for rockets, it is said that their speed can be increased to 22,800 miles per hour in the future. Even the most conservative estimate says that it can reach 5,000 miles per hour. More importantly, it can hit a predetermined target, and even if it occasionally misses, the difference will not exceed half a mile. If atomic bombs are loaded into these rockets and launched in groups from one country to another, from one continent to another, then in an instant, prosperous cities and simple villages will be in danger of being reduced to ashes.</p>

<p>American chemical engineer D埃卡德 was a very remarkable prophet. In 1941, he predicted that atomic bombs would appear in World War II, and that the war would soon be declared over once this weapon was used. Judging from the facts, it is absolutely correct!</p>

<h3 id="e169">A Brief Discussion of Chinese Female Novelists <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>— Zhao Jingshen</p>
<p>It has been half a year since I returned to Shanghai on November 1st of last year. I always feel that the two years in Lihuang were more leisurely. The past six months of life in Shanghai have been particularly busy, and chaotic, something I have not experienced in the past ten years or so. I really want to "steal half a day of leisure" to appreciate literary works, but in fact, I have never been able to do so. I especially cherish the books and publications that my friends send me, and I have arranged a bookcase specifically for these books and publications. I value friends in the literary and art world more than all officials and dignitaries, and I always carefully read their works as a kind of pleasure. But since I can't find time, I have to steal time from my busy schedule and use the time on the tram or at banquets to read them. Reading books like this, my mind cannot calm down, and the difference in the degree of perception is self-evident.</p>
<p>Under such circumstances, I finished reading Ms. Luo Hong's two collections of short stories: "Ghost Shadow" and "This Era".</p>
<p>After a quick look, I have this impression: In the past, the novels written by modern female novelists were all lyrical, showing that they are women, and the scope of their descriptions was limited to the small circle in which they lived. But Luo Hong is realistic. If we don't look at the author's name, we can hardly know that the author is a woman. The scope of her descriptions is broad, and many things are beyond her own small circle. I have read too few creations, and it is easy to fall into mistakes if I make generalizations and judgments. If you allow me to say a conjecture, then within the scope of my reading, the female novelists of the past could only be said to be poets, and Ms. Luo Hong is the real novelist.</p>
<p>Bing Xin is a poet and novelist. Her "Smile" is really just prose poetry. Almost every one of her novels has a Bing Xin in it. Love for the sea, love for mothers, love for children, is full of lyrical tones. Lu Yin's "Old Friends by the Sea" is probably a portrayal of her own past life. Ling Shuhua's "Xiao Liang'er Lian" has infiltrated her own emotions and preferences. Lü Yi's "Thorns" can be said to be her autobiography. Even Ding Ling's early works, the scope of description seems to be limited to intellectuals. Chen Xue Zhao's "Tired Journey" is also lyrical. In short, although their works each have their own style and characteristics, they still show that they are women's works, making readers see the brand clearly. But Luo Hong is different. Except for occasionally seeing some delicate descriptions, if you cover up the author's name, it is almost difficult to guess that this is a female writer's work—especially when compared with Bing Xin and Ling Shuhua.</p>
<p>Before Luo Hong, has there ever been a female writer who wrote novels with such broad knowledge as "Twenty Years of Strange Phenomena"? Maybe there are, even many, but unfortunately, I repeat, I have too little time to read books. I haven't even read Shen Ying's and Feng Zi's novels yet, and I haven't read many of Bing Ying's and Bai Lang's novels either. There are also some female novelists whose names I can't name for a while.</p>
<p>Luo Hong writes novels, it seems, starting from restraint to free and easy, from meticulous brushwork to freehand brushwork, from piling up to plain description. To be honest, there was a short period of time when I didn't like her novels, that is, those that were restrained, meticulous, and piled up. However, restraint, meticulous brushwork, and piling up should be her solid foundation for writing novels. It is better to be liberated from restraint to free and easy, from meticulous brushwork to freehand brushwork, and from piling up to plain description, than to be free and easy from the beginning to the point of being uncontrollable, freehand to the point of being unable to control the meaning, and plain description to the point of being insufficient in strength, right? It's strange to say, especially "Ghost Shadow" and "This Era," which are the titles of these two books, I don't like. "Ghost Shadow" is too complicated. When I was a child, I watched "Eastern Zhou Kingdoms", and I couldn't feel like reading it even after watching it several times. After a while, I watched it again, but I still couldn't watch it. "This Era" is also written too heavily, not lively, and does not give readers a clear impression. I hope the author uses these two novels as the titles of the books just because they can be used as book titles, not because they particularly like these two.</p>
<p>There are several touching stories of the War of Resistance in the collection, but I especially appreciate those that depict human relationships and worldly affairs. For example: "Trampled Joy" in the Ghost Shadow Collection, and "Friendship", "Wang Boyan and Li Siye", and "Neighbors" in the This Era Collection.</p>
<p>I hope the author will be a "female Wu Woyao", a "Chinese Balzac", and continue to work hard in the aspect of social novels!</p>

<p>— Zhang Baihuai</p>
<p>If there were no debates among people,</p>
<p>And we allowed deceitful hypocrites to control complex language,</p>
<p>The soul of true beauty</p>
<p>Would be destroyed by the venomous arrows of ugliness....</p>
<p>In a dark and deep sea of night....</p>
<p>A dream, carrying a gray, immense shadow, fiercely invaded the pillow of a stubborn young man.</p>
<p>"Impudent one!" It sternly spat out intimidating flames, and said in a rude, savage voice, "If you continue to be stingy with the conscience of your life, from now on, I will completely deprive you of all your beauty?"</p>
<p>The young man maintained his peaceful composure, replacing trembling, guilty answers with steady, measured breaths, and the sounds of thoughtful consideration.</p>
<p>"Humph! I question you!" The immense shadow roared urgently, and waving its coarse, shaggy hand, declared with absolute authority, "On the treasure island under my jurisdiction, exhibiting the wealth of human destiny, why do you dare to be so presumptuous, rolling your eyes in contempt, and secretly cursing my majesty with cold laughter?"</p>
<p>Like casting a huge rock into a waveless pond, the young man's heart stirred up high-splashing water; however, he was not at all afraid, and said calmly:</p>
<p>"You... but, who are you?—A terrible devil!" he thought to himself.</p>
<p>"Me?" The immense shadow did not intensify its fury; uneasy swaying revealed fierce contemplation. In an instant, as if a liar breaking free from interrogation loopholes, it solemnly and proudly introduced its task: "Me? I am the giver of your humanity's hellish happiness; as long as anyone is willing to follow the direction of my will, then no matter what difficult or impoverished situation they are in, they can obtain supreme joy and satisfaction! So—" it hesitated slightly, pausing: "Your conscience should be dedicated to me!"</p>
<p>As if raising his keen alertness, a chilling gust of wind blew on the young man's cheeks—</p>
<p>"Haha, how is that possible?" He showed a very distrustful look. "Conscience is the value of my life's existence, and you, strange theory, unbelievable! Since you say you are the giver of happiness to us humans, why do you inflict jealousy and harm upon my innate goodness?" As he spoke, he seemed not to be standing in this narrow, dark room, but rather standing in the open field of truth of his daily work.</p>
<p>"Hmph! You actually dare to resist me! You ignorant, stubborn fool! I tell you, your ideals are all absurd, and will only bring you frustration and resentment!" The immense shadow quickly revealed its original ferocity.</p>
<p>And the young man, he could not endure it anymore!</p>
<p>"What? You monster who insults pure and good humanity!" He clenched his fist, wanting to jump up. "I know you are merely trying to maintain false beliefs and status by taking advantage of people's ignorance and greed! You..." Ah, what is this?...... In an instant, his nerves fell into the emptiness of disillusionment, realizing how ridiculous and illusory the realm from which he came was.</p>
<p>The young man sat up with all his strength—</p>
<p>"Alas, nightmare, unanswerable nightmare!" he muttered to himself, throwing the sign of interrogation toward the night sky, where dark clouds pressed low outside the window.</p>
<p>"What did you do in your dream? Isn't it?..." A person's question, vague, uneasy, and with a hint of ridicule.</p>
<p>"I had a torrent of eloquence that did not satisfy me," was the young man's answering voice.</p>
<p>"Eloquence? You said... about what?"</p>
<p>An intellectual storm from who knows where, the floodgates of language between them, and so, in this silent night, by seepage, burst, and overflowed.</p>
<p>First, the young man sitting in the regret of the dream said:</p>
<p>"Please use the full power of your views to bombard the castle of my beliefs! I say, there is more hatred than love in the world."</p>
<p>"What do you hate?"</p>
<p>"I hate the filth in the hearts of mankind; they always regard themselves as supremely honorable, while others exist only for their happiness. I don't know why this heart is marked with so many traces of misfortune; it either reveals how selfish people bestow harm on those who are different from them, or it is indignant at those darlings of fate, using despicable means to escape the death penalty they deserve; it either records how those obsessed with profit and position conceal their unforgivable shallowness, or it hates the madness of those greedy ambitionists...". The young man's painful tone contained too much anger.</p>
<p>"But—alas, calm down, were you taken to an abyss of ugliness and cursing by the demon in your dream?..." The person speaking raised a hand that resembled a weeping gesture, unsure whether it was expressing sympathetic weakness.</p>
<p>The young man said affirmatively: "You have lost too much to age; I see you approaching the compromising road of humanity's trap day by day..."</p>
<p>"But, don't forget the world we move in; it hasn't left a single gap for your youth..."</p>
<p>"You've made a big mistake!" The young man jumped out of bed.</p>
<p>The greasy lamplight illuminated the dimness of the room; the young man's fervent thoughts were like a healthy child, gazing at the vast and boundless sea of life—</p>
<p>"Listen:" He seemed to be flipping open a page of colorful legend, or telling a fresh story to a child who loves imagination, his glittering pupils floating with the dreamy smile of wisdom. "It is not that I am disappointed in the laughter of the world, but that its moral decay has damaged its own dignity; do not think that I no longer have any hope for the world, because this heart is not only for my own happiness. Love is not only not my enemy, but also the banner of my life. If it is said that indifference to the vanity of the world is all garbage, then those who only seek personal enjoyment are even more pitiable!</p>
<p>"Ah, I am saying that the vicissitudes of the world will turn your black hair white..."</p>
<p>"Those who love truth are forever young for the sake of work!"</p>
<p>When the argument subsided, the crowing birds outside the window were beginning to sing, and the train of dawn had already brought a new day....</p>

<p>— Yang Lianyuan</p>
<p>Lychee</p>
<p>As I hurriedly walked down the stone steps, a color that was very familiar to me beckoned in front, tempting me to approach it.</p>
<p>You say, what color is that?</p>
<p>This reminds me of the years of war, for a long period of time in the past I had never seen this color: the crimson fruit shells containing the juicy, white-fleshed fruit. Now that I am freed from the dust of war and revisiting the old dreams of my childhood, the color of these lychees is just like the fiery passion of the daughters of the South, (it beckons me, familiar and yet unfamiliar.) Can it rekindle the love that has long been extinguished in me?</p>
<p>Ah, lychee, such a beautiful name, a honey-like name!</p>
<p>A ray of sunlight filters down from the parasol tree, shimmering on the lychee stall: some lychees are receiving the kisses of the sun, while others sob in the dark corners where the sunlight cannot reach.</p>
<p>Ah! Daughters of the South, with years of war, you are perhaps just like the lychees I see in this city, some basking in the dazzling flames of war, and others weeping in the wind and darkness!</p>
<p>Today, in the first summer of peaceful times, the lychees still bloom and bear fruit, the tender, honey-like juice moisturizing the hearts of young children. Lychees, your vibrant colors call to me, I wish you well!</p>
<p>Beloved, renew us; when will our lives bloom?</p>
<p>Cage</p>
<p>It was the time of day when bamboo cages were being sold in the market, imprisoning the small lives of dusk. With a child's innocence, I bought one for them, a cage to imprison small lives. That kind of small life, in my hometown, we call him: "Call Brother," the sound of calling is not exactly a beautiful melody, but it can still please the children, so he becomes the children's little toy to play with carefully on the mat, generation after generation.</p>
<p>We humans are intelligent, but we have even greater flaws, seeing the imprisonment and killing of other small lives, often feeling a kind of satisfying joy. But, please, intelligent people, think about it, what about ourselves, what kind of cage is imprisoning our youth, (how would children think of these things?)</p>
<p>People are just like this, deceiving themselves and satisfying themselves, that's how they survive.</p>
<p>And so, between people, there is also distance. An irreparable distance, because there is so much mutual deception and beautiful lies in the world.</p>
<p>So, is that how people live such a pathetic life?</p>
<p>Intelligent people, I think you are able to give yourselves satisfactory answers.</p>
<p>Break free from the gate of this cage! (Three Five, Six, Twenty)</p>
<h3 id="e174">Early Summer Vignette <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>— Ming</p>
<p>Early summer, ah! I gaze longingly at the green fields.</p>
<p>You wouldn't think that here, looking out the window, there is a mottled and filthy wilderness. Before my eyes, I have lost that vast green grassland; to the east, only a few sparse branches of parasol trees extend, too little green, summoning green memories, chasing after me all day long. And I have ultimately lost you, without a word, a gesture, a glance, indifferent and resolute. And so, there is no resentment, only a number of memories, wistfully following the season of summer!</p>
<p>There are no too hot days in Jiangnan; can the summer of the mountain city remain in your memory? The sunlight of early morning comes in from outside the door, a little bit of lonely excess heat. Too far away, ah! That green field, where so many life memories were spent! I silently recite two lines: "Treating wealth as peasants treat scholars, reading numbers with concern for the Way, not poverty," these were the lines of poetry that longed for friendship. I met you in that green field.</p>
<p>There, we once wore grass-green clothes together. Every day, in the faint light of dawn, with a fervent young heart, we watched the rising of the national flag of our motherland. On the grave mounds of the wilderness, we looked at the moon and counted the stars together. We praised Zhuangzi's life and recited Li Houzhu's verses. These are all recent memories, but now they are lost in the distant mountain city, in lonely Jiangnan, you no longer remember; "The small building again feels the east wind last night, in the moonlit night I cannot bear to look back at my lost country." Those hard but happy days!</p>
<p>You no longer need the memories of the past; you are clever and happy; you have read Zhuangzi. That kind of green trees and red buildings, leisurely and elegant life, makes you tired of forgetting those arduous and dark days. We are people living in two different circumstances, nurturing two different lives. Although we once shared a certain point of resonance with each other, you ultimately left me!</p>
<p>I can't forget falling down in the darkness and chaos, falling in the light and chaos, although I struggled through the darkness, and did not fall in the light and chaos, and even returned to this Jiangnan; but I am gasping for breath, faltering on the path of life. During this time, I longed to get some warmth of life from you, so that life could have some basis for existence, and perhaps walk more firmly. But you, you ultimately left, like someone accustomed to the stimulation of coffee and wine, after drinking a cup of the wine needed, without any drunkenness, any lingering affection, pushing the cup away and leaving. So calm and straightforward.</p>
<p>You said that in order to cherish another emotion, you had to forget the green memories. How do you distinguish for yourself your virtue and emotions? I have been gnawing at myself with this pain, but this has made me understand some of the meanings of life even more, and memory will make my faltering steps more firm on the path of life, and I will no longer hope for the illusions of mountain forests and springs.</p>
<p>I mistakenly received a cup of strong coffee from your hand, and ignored another cup of clear water necessary on the path of life. I originally wanted clear water, but drank the wrong coffee. For someone not accustomed to bitterness and sweetness, it will be a bitter aftertaste.</p>
<p>I remember you told me that Jesus said: "It is happiness to forgive others," I hope I can always remember this sentence.</p>
<p>After all, we once intertwined our lives, although it was such a short period of time, in the long string of hard days, you also shared some faint happiness for me, which will live forever in eternal memory.</p>
<p>The road of life is so long! But life is so short. When one day you feel the need for clear water on the road of life, I am willing to sincerely store a cup of pure clear water for you.</p>
<p>Let us forget the unpleasant and unbeautiful! 1945, 6, 12</p>

<p>— Zhao Qingge</p>
<p>For the children's first stage appearance, Mrs. Mo absolutely could not allow them to show a shabby appearance, so she specially ordered several sets of "gear" (i.e., stage costumes) for Lihua and Liyun. She also ordered two sets of "headdress" (i.e., head ornaments) for Lihua. This was another unavoidable expense. Investing the capital to seek profit, Mrs. Mo was willing! She calculated that she would earn countless interest beyond these capitals.</p>
<p>On the evening of New Year's Eve, Mrs. Mo was very happy. She prepared a lot of wine and dishes to entertain Shi Yulou, Second Mrs. Weng, Zhang Xian, etc. She also gave Lihua and Liyun each a silver dollar from Old Yuan's head as New Year's money. Shi Yulou, Second Mrs. Weng, and Zhang Xian also each gave a silver dollar. Liyun was so happy that she jumped up and down, while Lihua remained calm and composed.</p>
<p>"Xiaohua, Xiaoyun, tomorrow is the day of your first stage appearance, you must earn some face for your master! If you sing badly, your master will beat you." Mrs. Mo said to the two little sisters with a smile.</p>
<p>Lihua and Liyun didn't say anything. They were each thinking about their own things.</p>
<p>"They won't sing badly! See whose disciples they are? The peaches and plums in front of my Zhang Xian's door, none of them fail to blossom." Zhang said, blowing his own horn, and then winking at Lihua with a slanted eye.</p>
<p>"Don't brag, maybe tomorrow the two children will go on stage and not open their mouths, at that time be careful to snap your strings." Second Mrs. Weng said jokingly.</p>
<p>"Don't worry, Sister Shi! I guarantee it. Oh, did you see? At the entrance of the theater, I posted a big poster, which says: 'Sister Flowers Mo Lihua Mo Liyun Grand Debut on New Year's Day.' Many people paid attention, hehe, if it sells out tomorrow, two-thirds is due to your Shi Yulou's appeal, and one-third must be attributed to our pair of sister flowers!" Zhang Xian boasted triumphantly, as if boasting about his own glorious achievements.</p>
<p>"Really, I specially went to see it with my sister today, and the entrance of the theater was crowded with people." Mrs. Mo said with a smile. She and Zhang Xian felt the same glory.</p>
<p>"Alas! It looks like three of our family are going to eat 'opening rice' (meaning to make a living by singing!)" Shi Yulou said with emotion, looking somewhat sad.</p>
<p>"What's wrong with eating 'opening rice'? If they become 'headliner' (the leading performer in a troupe) like you in the future, that's something to be proud of!" Zhang Xian said. He shrugged his hooked nose quite disapprovingly.</p>
<p>"What's so 'proud' about being a 'headliner'? Sooner or later, you are providing entertainment for others! You can't even rest for a while during the New Year." Shi Yulou couldn't help but retort to Zhang Xian in annoyance, yawning as he walked out. He turned back and shouted: "It's time to go to the theater, my master Qin Shi!"</p>
<p>Zhang Xian responded. He winked flirtatiously at Second Mrs. Weng, mumbling:</p>
<p>This is called eating a line and complaining about a line!</p>
<p>Second Mrs. Weng gave a bitter smile. At this time, her heart was more uncomfortable than Shi Yulou's. She understood that Shi Yulou's grumbling was sincere, because Shi Yulou's body had been very bad recently. Although opium was giving him energy, he could barely sing a few sentences, but his voice was already much worse. But the burden of life made him unable to not sing. He can still sing now, but what will happen in two years when he can't sing? So he is annoyed! He resents this line! Second Mrs. Weng loves him. She pities him, but she is powerless to help him. For this reason, she often sheds tears in secret recently.</p>
