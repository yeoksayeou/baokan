<h3>國大第七次會通過　憲草提案展期截止　邊疆問題引起全場注意</h3>
<p>〔本報南京三日電〕國民大會第七次大會，三日上午舉行，九時十分到達代表一一六二人，宣布開會，孔賡擔任主席，秘書處宣讀第六次會議記錄及祝賀大會開會文電，代表請假函電，後書副秘書長宣布主席團第九次會議決定事項：（一）十二月五日截止接收提案，（二）綜合審査委員會組成各單位，即希於三日上午十二時前各推定三人，將名單送交主席團，旋有代表數人起立發言，認爲廣泛發表意見，尙未至普遍情形，來能表達自己意見者佔絕大多數，盼截止接收提案日期能予延展，雷副秘書長再度說明，截止接收提案後，仍將舉行大會，每日上午大會，下午審査委員會，齊頭並進，對提案之整理，可收迅速之效，旋因會塲空氣趨於延展時期者多，主席即提付表決，結果廣泛發表意見，送提案日期延至十二月七日下午十二時止之意見，以八四五人佔多數通過。會議開始，首有代表孫繩武發言，認爲新疆蒙古代表遠道而來，備極辛勞，應讓彼等儘先發言，邊疆代表聆之均熱烈鼓掌，繼由張開璉·王澤民·黄夢飛·安輔廷·郭中與·任卓宣·阿合買提江·艾沙·楊砥中·鄧珠娜姆·羅家倫等相繼發言，六日上午發言重心在邊疆代表，所提問題均側重邊疆民族，惟事關令國政治，故極能吸引全塲代表之注意，大會至上二時散會。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京三日電〕國大七次會議，三日下午三時四十分繼續舉行，出席代表一一二四人，由劉代表蘅衡靜（女）担任主席，開會後，對中華民國憲法草案繼續作廣泛之討論，鄂代表孟憲章，魯代表顧熾，北平代表孫繩武，自由職業代表江一平，冀代表曲直生，贛代表楊度普，靑年黨代表宋益淸，晋代表梁上棟，遼北代表劉國增、湘代表劉子亞，鄂代表邱建元等先後發言，主要論點仍爲憲草中之（一）建都問題，有主張建都北平或武漢者，亦有主張多設陪都者。（二）中華民國領土之變更，有主張非經國民大會決定不得變更者，（三）增列職業代表問題，（四）立法院，行政院職權問題，至四時五十分休息十分鐘，後由秘書處宣讀葉溯中，章淵若，黄國書，冷欣，張道行等二十四代表就憲草所提之書面意見廿四件，六八時正散會。</p>
<p>〔又電〕國大開幕後，三日爲第十八日，續有靑年黨代表李毓華，區域代表馬紹武二人報到，連前已報到代表總計一六五四人。</p>
<h3>上午各代表發言　側重於邊疆民族</h3>
<p>〔本報南京三日電〕國大三日上午第七次大會中，各代表重要發言如次：</p>
<p>張開　：第七條定都南京應予删去，各國憲法均無此規定，第十一章第一百十四條所定省，得召集省民代表大會，依據省縣自治通則制定省自治法一點，應有更改爲自由制定。</p>
<p>王澤民：中華民國憲法草案，應本三民主義五權憲法之精神，且以五五憲草爲原則。</p>
<p>黄夢飛：對立法院與監察院的關係，吾人如何可使其合於理想，按照此項憲草，立法院代行政權，國大等於無用，僅僅有選舉總統之權，亦可謂有半個選舉權。運用議會政治，國大與立法院會議可以同時舉行，不致發生摩擦，但又流於非牛非馬之代議制，故議會如規定不妥，則議會亦將流於專制，吾人認爲國民大會應有罷監察院·立法院之權，庶可平衡。</p>
<p>安輔廷：增加社會安全章，並規定職業代表選舉制度。</p>
<p>郭中興：北伐時代雙八年抗戰，工人均盡最大努力，工人對國家貢獻甚大，故職業代表有極充分之理由列八選舉早。</p>
<p>任卓宣（即葉靑）：此項憲草，乃爲代議制與五權憲法之間的一種形式，吾人對此有下列數點意見：（一）國民大會中有三種代表，人民要選舉三次，本人認爲人民只能選舉一次，（二）立法委員與監察委員不應爲國大代表，又對於選舉代表孫科會解釋爲各地選出代表將偏重地方利益，此種解釋完全不合事實。（三）經國大制定之憲法，其修改權則不屬於國大，極不合理。（四）吾人必須以理想改造現實，推進現實，吾人理想是五權憲法，如離開理想而制憲法，就不是百年大計，而是一年大計，兩年大計了。吾人應按照五欋憲法理想，儘量採用歐美制度之長，合而創造世界民主政治最進步之政制。</p>
<h3>陸空聯合演習　招待國大代表</h3>
<p>〔聯合社南京三日電〕首都軍校學生及駐軍包括步騎砲隊空軍及傘兵等，定於本月八日在明故宮飛機塲舉行空陸聯合軍事演習，招行國大代表。由南京衛戊司令湯恩伯將軍任指揮，演習畢並將由湯氏招待　代表　　？</p>
<p>阿合買提江：本人是新疆代表，來自邊疆，對於憲草有如下數點意見。（一）第五條中華民國各民族一律平等，不僅是寫出來，同時要能眞正做到。（二）第五條條文下，應明確規定各民族之原有名稱和高度的民族自治權（三）第十一章與第十二章，即在省縣制度一章之後，應添增民族一章。（四）給予新疆以高度的民族自治權。</p>
<p>艾沙：在憲草內，對國內少數民族的自治權利未能親定，覺得非常遺憾，此項憲草乃國民黨領導下起草的憲草，沒有能遵昭國父遺敎制定，建國大綱第四條內對各民族地位有明確之規定，第一次全國大會宣言，亦承認民族自治權，自衛權，二中全會決議案對各民族平等予少數民族以自治權等，但憲草中竟均無明確之規定，在邊疆，多少年來，儘多流血慘事，有人說是不滿現實，好鬧亂，其實此乃政府缺乏好的政策，少數人錯誤的估計，少數人的侮辱，這些都是歷史上的記載，食官汚吏到了邊疆爲所欲爲，盡量　榨剝削，折衷責任，　由他們負責，一切應有以　救，以後不應該再有，憲草上應有很好的規定，如果沒有自治自由生存的保障，是難免有流血的事發生的。吾人希望獲得獨立之下曰治之上的高度民族自治，理由如下；（一）獨立自主自治自由是世界人類基本的要求，新疆同胞自亦不能例外。（二）我們鄰近的蘇聯屬同血同族同敎的人，都得到聯邦自治的地位，哈撒克，烏斯別克，阿富汗都是回敎，印度一萬萬回敎，還不滿於比例之平等，而要把印度分一半實行自治權，這是極影響吾人情緒的。（三）世界潮流日新月異，我們得不到自治領的民族，是不答應的。最後强調稱：現在國內少數民族要求自治，有人認爲是分裂獨立的遝動，其實乃一神聖自由的運動，我們神聖自由得保障，自然不會有分裂的運動，比如美國，是一個自由的國家，就沒有分裂運動，任何一個地方有了不自由現象，就有分裂運動。所以如果我們不能達到目的，將來亦不免出此一途，歷史上所有的運動都是爲了生存，爲了自由。</p>
<p>楊砥中：本人是西南土著民族代表，有意見如次，第三，第五，第七，第十一，第十三各章，應加上幾個字：「各省內有土著民族應按人口比例進行選舉」。我們土著民族散在黔·湘·滇·桂一帶，沒有一個做漢好的，引艾沙先生語，過去由貪官汚吏負賣，今後中國民大會負責。</p>
<p>鄧珠娜姆：本人是西康巴安人，諸位可知，邊疆千萬同胞，正期待大家來同情培植，認爲中央對各地民族應一視同仁，本人意見是對邊疆敎育及各項設施，要求得到均衡發展，使整個的國家有前途，尤對邊疆婦女在職業上亦應予保障。</p>
<p>羅家倫：對民權很注意，但對民生則忽略，基太國策章，對勞工保障太疏忽·第一三九條應修正，爲國家應使耕者有其田，勞動者有其工作及生活之保障，第一四一條「對於私人之財富及私人事業應保護之」一句，有助長資本主義之色彩，老試章，僅規定應超出黨派一語太空泛，比如國民黨自不能干涉。而靑年黨，民社黨亦應退出學校及考試機關。又審計機關應優監察院內，可增檢舉貪官汚吏之權。</p>
<h3>憲草審查會名單　可能在今日大會中提出　主題團研商各組召集人</h3>
<p>〔本報南京三日電〕憲草審査委員會之分組名單，大致已吿齊備，各組之召集人，正由主席團考慮巾。又綜合審委會各單位推選參加之代表名單，已收到四十餘單位，其餘數單位亦即將分別送達大會秘書處轉主席團，全部憲委會名單，可望於四日之大會中提出。</p>
<p>〔本報南京三日電〕國大主席團三日下午四時四十五分，於胡庶華主持下開會，決定四日舉行第八次會議，上午九時至十二時，由胡庶華主持，下午三時至六時，由王雲五主席，繼續對憲草作廣泛　　　主席　並定於下午大會休息時間再舉行會議。</p>
<h3>吉遼兩區域代表　均主張定都北平</h3>
<p>〔本報南京三日電〕國大三日下午會議中，各代表發言如次：鄂區代表孟憲章：（一）憲草修正案，在政治方面之規定，或較五五憲草進步，經濟方面則不然，如人民無經濟權，何以保障其政治權，此點須注意補充。（二）一國之內，民族舊雄不足懼，懼在無正確之民族政策，自治與統一乃一物之二面，絕非相反，吾人應以冷靜頭腦，遠大眼光，將此問題求其解決。</p>
<p>魯職代表顧熾：職業團體與婦女團體之選舉，必須利入憲法。平區代表孫繩武：（一）國大非黨派會議，不應過份遷就政協決議，且政協無邊咆代表參加，決議確有有失整個性。（二）第五條關於國內各民族一律平等之規定不够，應加訂扶助弱小民族。（三）第八條雖規定全國人民不分宗敎，一律平等，但此次會中，回敎代表殊少，第十二軍選舉中，應加列各省區生活習俗特殊之敎民以一定之名額。（四）對邊疆地方高度自治之意見，以爲行憲後省長以下均公開選舉，一切問題應能解決，如午前艾沙代表提出之獨立以下自治以上之制度，殊乏具體辦法。</p>
<p>自由職業代表江一平：國家局勢需要强有能之政府，故應於無集權現象之情况下，使治權儘量發展，乃修正案中之行政院受立法院過度控制，行政院長非但不能放手作事，且於任何作爲之前，必先向立委大肆活動，影響公務，希各黨派代表均能與人民代表同一目標，依孫中山先生之五權分等政府有能之原則修正此點，並使立法院等均對國大負責，俾人民得以政權督導政府。</p>
<p>冀職代表曲直生：首都爲一國之神經中樞，其位置應在憲法中作硬性之規定，但究定在何處，應以冷靜公正不私之態度，多予討論，愼重取決。</p>
<p>贛職代表楊度普：（一）權能劃分五權獨立之原則，必須確保。（二）對人民生活健康之保陣，應予規定，公醫制尤應採行。</p>
<p>吉區代表李文圃：甲，請定都北平，（一）國防上定都北平，可近東北，西北，北方混亂災難之現象，亦得以改觀。（二）　候上，北方氣候對身心健康行政效率，均有裨益。（三）文化上，北平爲我國文化巾心·風氣淳厚，不若南京，經常受滬市金融經濟之影響，致染糜費。乙，國大代表，總統，副總統，立監委之任期，一律减爲四年，國大每隔兩年開會一次。</p>
<p>晋職代表梁上楝：（一）國父一生革命奮鬥，皆爲實行三民主義，第一條應冠明爲「三民主義共和國」。（二）第　條國家領土之變更，非經國大通過不可。（三）職業團體均應推選代表，參加國大及立監院。（四）「基本國策」章名不妥，條文亦多牽强，如第卅七條中，關於聯合國憲章之規定，實無此風頭之必要。</p>
<p>遼北區域代表劉國增：（一）憲草內容與序言不符，並未依據孫中山先生創立中華民國之遺敎，應改正。（二）第一條「民有民治民事」字樣，爲畫蛇添足。（三）第四條領土變更須經國大通過。（四）國都應定在北平。（五）第八條「無男女宗敎種族階級及黨派之分」句删去。（六）人民權義中應加入生存權。</p>
<p>湘區代表劉子亞：對貨幣問題另有提案，請各位注意。</p>
<p>鄂區代表邱建元：（一）要求詳訂農業政策，解救農民痛苦。（二）確定軍人地位待遇，以酬辛勞。（三）遷都武漢。</p>
<p>冀區代表趙子懋：（一）國大代表之選舉·職業團體及邊區同胞均應普遍參加。（二）國大每年開會一次·閉會期間由駐會代表會代行職權。（三）制定法律，中國大決定原則，並中國大選出專家學者組成之立法院制訂（四）國大對中央政府官吏，應有廣泛之罷免權。</p>
<h3>民社黨參加國大　爲完成主憲法</h3>
<p>孫寳毅在滬發表談話</p>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕中國民主社會黨一日下午三時，曾假範圍舉行中常會議，張君勱，伍憲子，徐傅霖，湯住心，沙彥楷，孫寳剛，孫寳毅均出席，三日據該黨上海發言人孫寳毅稱。會間曾對一般問題，作廣泛討論，最後有一具體決議，即本黨參加國民大會，爲求民主憲法之完成，其他問題，如參加政府等，與國大爲截然兩事，本黨尙未考慮及此。此外幷推定本入爲本黨上海發言人，徐傅霖，蔣勻田爲南京發言人。又參加中常會之各常委中，除徐傅霖已於三日晨搭車普京外，餘均在滬。</p>
<h3>暹駐華大使抵滬　定旬內晋京呈遞國書　據談決努力敦睦邦交</h3>
<p>〔本市訊〕暹羅第一任駐華大使塞古安杜拉勒克Sanguon　Lulaak，前晚抵滬，將於本月九·十日左右晋京，謁蔣主席，並呈遞國書。大使昨並接見中央社接者稱：渠將致力中暹邦交，使之日臻善境，此次來華將與中國致府洽商中暹貿易之諸種問題，暹羅米糧，木材　以及橡膠可設法運入中國，中國亦有數項物資爲暹羅所需要，中暹外交關係，在戰前甚爲良好，該地華僑與暹人相處向稱無事，及後因戰事發生，受日人之影響，中暹雙方乃有爭執，不久前之亂事，即其一例。但此種問題已漸减少，其根本改善辦法，厥爲敎育雙方人民，使彼等互相了解，互相合作，今後兩國邦交，自當更求和好。談及暹羅現况，大使稱：暹羅自大戰後，人民生活不及戰前，但比之其他各國已算良好，人民尙有充足之種食，在政治方面問題，亦較戰前增多，暹法雙方亦已互相取得諒解，並互派大使。法大使明春即可抵暹。暹羅將來並準備在上海，汕頭及海口設領事館。記者又詢渠對華印象，大使稱：渠於一九四三年抗戰期間曾秘密自邊赴重慶，謁蔣主席，對中國印象至爲良好。渠並稱：暹人多有中國學童，最近來華訪問之　比里以及暹羅首相之祖先均爲中國人，渠本人之父亦爲中國福建籍，大使現年四十四歲，曾歷任暹羅不管部大臣，並在財政部，議院，法院等機構任職，在暹羅政界中甚著聲望。</p>
<h3>港英軍侵入深圳　當場並擊斃我村民一人</h3>
<p>〔中央社香港三日電〕記者今晚自可靠方面獲息，英國武裝部隊一批，曾於今日破壞我國之主權，傳彼等於今日下午自九龍侵入深圳，並擊斃我國村民一名，駐於九龍該區邊境之英警察，於記者往詢時，已承認該項不幸事件，並稱，刻正在調査，故拒絕發表詳情。傳英軍一行於今日下午二時侵入深圳，旨在逮捕我國靑年二名。據稱，該二人自英國境內私運大量麵粉，深圳之我國駐軍，因英軍此舉破壞我國主權，故將其驅回，然一小時後，彼等復與若千援軍再度侵人，惟仍爲我軍所阻，我國村民羣集觀覩，傳英軍即於該時發槍射擊，並擊斃村民一人。</p>
<h3>會場爭說邊疆事</h3>
<p>— 本報記者　張　明　濮德玠</p>
<p>—國大七次會花絮錄</p>
<p>大會到了第七次，廣泛發表意見，已經呌人意識到疲勞轟炸的厭倦。但是，今天給你的口味又調換了，邊疆代表的要求，和寄託於政府的熱切的願望，使與會的人每個人都想到了那個邊遠的區域，有着中華民國的重要的細胞。</p>
<p>阿合買提紅一個代表新疆同胞，發言戴一頂絳紅絨黑邊黑花的小帽到是一身西服，嘴邊上一撮鬍子，身材魁梧，兩目奕奕有神，可是他不會說國語，於是今天首决在中華民國的國內會議上，使用了翻譯人員。</p>
<p>艾沙說出很流利的國語，他呼喚出最迫切的要求和最嚴重的問題。他一開始就提出警語二「新疆是全國最重要的問題，中國等於一所房子，新疆就等於房子的牆和門，如果房子沒有，牆和門都有什麼辦法？我要諸位多給我一點時間，請諸位看看我們的牆和門是怎麽一個樣子。」</p>
<p>邊疆的女同胞，鄧珠娜姆是以社會賢達代表資格出席的，他的講話是邊疆，民族和婦女問題並重，她是中央政治大學的敎授，所以態度極穩重，很受人歡迎。</p>
<p>大會一開始，曾有人提出要把國大預備會所硏討的憲法拿出來一同硏究，但是這一聲沒有呌響，也許是離題太遠了。</p>
<p>大會開始不久，會塲中曾經發生一點誤會，原來吳經熊代表有一書面意見提交主席團，是由雷副秘書長宣讀的，重要的意見是要規定職業代表選舉制度，但在後左角一位工會代表就錯了以爲是吳的意見是「不明確規定職業代表選舉」，於是大聲呼呌「請吳代表說明理由，否則「全體退席」，亂鬨鬨一陣，新聞記者和會塲幹事又去「趕集」，却不　經　副秘書長一席解釋，立即化險爲夷，若十新聞記者都預備轉移陣地，有人認爲那個角落是大會塲的火藥庫。</p>
<p>張厲生部長走過新聞記者席，被包圍了很久，他對記者的新聞寫法加以指示：「最好綜合寫」，「要愼重」。</p>
<p>任卓宜代表就是當年聲名煊赫的葉靑，因爲發言精彩，一時聽衆都鼓掌歡迎。同時在台上幾次按鈴後仍要求准其繼續說下去，此所謂，頗得民心也。</p>
<p>七次會下半天的會議，由唯一的女主席劉蘅靜擔任，她着了一襲深紫色的旗袍，外罩淺咖啡色呢大衣，戴一副金絲眼鏡，梳着鬆鬆的髪髻，在掌聲中盈盈就位，右面是高大的雷震，恰成對比，她接受了攝影記者們的獵取鏡頭後，打着廣東味兒的官話，來主持會議，按起鈴來威風凛凛。</p>
<p>剛開會，張道藩出現了，走到邵力子跟前，規規矩矩打一躬，邵忙筆着還禮，站起來讓他定到裏面的位子上，誰知他是走錯了，結果又出來，坐在前面一排。江一平說：「對於孫中山先生，我們不是因爲他是國父纔信他底遺敎，而是因爲他的崇高政治理想，才尊他爲國父，希望國民黨·靑年黨·民社黨都能同意，大會應公正地就國父政治理想的原則，把憲法修訂得完美無缺」。</p>
<p>李文圃主張建都北平，講到氣候上的理由時說：「北平一年四季都適宜工作，南京則不然，夏天差不多有一百度，太熱，使人不能作事，每年這種時候，政府的高級官員要去廬山避暑，耽誤政務事小，耗費國帑事大，我們國民大會是代表人民的，我們不許把人民的血汗錢這般浪擲。」引起熱烈鼓掌。</p>
<p>劉國增要求將人民有生存權一點列入，認爲必須把民生主義兌現，人民才能生存·他說：「國民黨不能實行民生主義，共產黨才能搗亂，國民黨如眞的實行了民生主義，共產黨早就消滅了。如今國內閙的亂七八糟，民不聊生，要知道如果人民不能生存，甚麼法律全是胡扯。」</p>
<p>休息之前劉主席宣佈：「有人說會塲裏人多空氣太壞，請求把門打開，但是我想坐在門邊的代表先生一定怕冷，下面再有一位講過後就休息，把所有的門全打開換換空氣」。於是等邱建元發表一篇慷慨的農民演說後，大家出去換空氣。</p>
<p>休息後只有一個人發言，就開始，宣讀書面意見一件又一件，兩位報吿員輪班讀下去，一直到散會，但是聽的人寥寥無幾。</p>
<p>五時四十五分，鄧文儀自左前方側面入塲，儀容英俊，軍服筆挺，一個箭步就坐在四五三號甘乃光的空座上，和隔座四五一號的王雋英，（南京數報曾登她已被大會公認爲國大之后）與前排的陳逸雲，榮熙，有說有笑，談到散會。（十二月三日）</p>

<h3>法記者報道今日之大連</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞長春二日電〕法國新聞社記者傑爾遜頃來電稱：據負責方面語本社記者稱：大連城內蘇聯軍隊，於本年四月間即已撤退，嗣後在大連城內即不復見有蘇聯士兵踪跡，此乃衆有目共睹之事實。美國駐大連領事館，殆已將此事電吿國務院，惟外界傳說紛紜，有謂　蘇聯軍隊至十一月間始撤退，並將大連市政交與中國共產黨，此說純係向壁虛構，世界與論不能信以爲眞。緣自四月杪以來，蘇聯僑民居在大連城內者，均係平民，大半爲大連市政府之公務員，依照一九四五年八月所成立之中蘇同盟條的，大連市政係由中蘇兩國共同管轄，在過去七個月內，大連城內雖不見有士兵踪跡，但在城外，仍駐有蘇聯軍隊，故在事實上，大連城仍在旅順蘇軍防區之內，按此一蘇軍防區，北至大連城之東北三十英里處，幾至切前日本租借地關東區之南，依照由蘇條約規定，大連爲自由港，不得駐有軍隊之故。大連城內，除有警察而外，未駐有任何軍隊，又因此項規定，國軍開入大連城，實不可能，良以國軍自陸上開入大連城，勢必與蘇軍發生衝突。據杜聿明將軍於數日前表示，國軍接收大通，決不採用武力，國軍在蘇軍防區之外，等候開入，已歷一月有餘。此外，大連市政府，聞係由當地人民選舉，雖非一百分之一百共產黨，但共產黨勢力甚爲强大云。</p>

<h3>陜北碉綫視察記　宜群等縣數百里內無一國軍　民眾自衛隊多數爲共軍解散</h3>
<p>〔本報西安三日電〕記者視察陜北宜君·同官·耀縣，淳化等縣碉綫地區後返西安，數百里碉綫上無一國軍，俱係停戰最後撤離者，接守碉錢之各縣民衆自衛隊，武器窳劣，多數爲共軍解散，接近邊區各縣，前以人民困苦，轄免賦稅，已決於明年恢復，民衆對此均表不滿，半月來黄陵至栒邑之義形地帶一綫，共軍集結重兵，截至目前止，有警一旅之紅六團，紅八團，新四旅之五一六團，一七七團，新四軍暫編第二旅，第三旅，警三團等番號。其經常活動爲殺害保甲人員，繳收武器，拉走牲口·大車·糧食·物資·近日稍息，但局勢仍至緊張，咸楡公路東側地區，原不屬邊區範圍，有來歷不明之武裝多股集結。記者前日離同官時，城東卅里之紅土鎭被攻陷，鎭長遇害，拉去牲口物資。黄陵縣四周，彼等進出允繁，黄宜形勢較爲嚴重。陜甘寗邊區之界綫，似在無定狀態，咸楡公路沿綫國軍不斷投書勸共軍勿近縣城，否則決予射擊。勝利以來，陜北國軍已顯著减少，現僅各縣駐有少數國軍。記者來去咸楡公路及各處鄕道上，十日間僅在同官遇二空卡車，向北駛去，道途寂寥，寒塵蔽日，惟右煤騾羣日與爲伍。綜觀軍事形勢，共軍隨時可突破守綫南下，國軍駐數之少，大出記者意料。</p>
<h3>如此「翻身」運動</h3>
<p>陜共向敎堂逼索敎產</p>
<p>〔中央社西安三日電〕共黨近在陝北三邊一帶，厲行「翻身」運動，向惟子樑山橋畔，白泥井，黑樑灣等處天主敎堂逼索敎產，幷追索自廿四年以來敎堂之年收租谷，比籍及華人司收梅濟鼎，沙智林，龔德華等，因不堪壓迫，先後逃亡，中途有在三邊被共軍相留，備受凌虐者，陜省府除分電各縣營救外，幷飭社會處撥款救濟。</p>
<h3>美主教蔡伐斯　受「清算」審間</h3>

<h3>中共內部的黑暗　在「群眾運動指示」中暴露無遺　自認減租減息工作仍極不平衡</h3>
<p>〔中央社保定三日電〕頃自關係方面獲得共黨「晋綏邊區普遍羣衆運動指示」之甫要文件一篇，長達五千餘字，其內容適足以暴露共黨內部黑暗，無異自畫招供。</p>
<p>關於所謂晋綏邊區的羣衆運動，該文件說缺點很多，從地域上看，減租減息的工作，還是極不平衡，羣衆至今不曾發動起來，幹部存着爲可對上級寫報吿而工作的邀功思想。</p>
<p>「在工作方面與政策的堂握上」，該文件稱：我們的缺點與錯誤更嚴重，一切工作不從當時當地羣衆的迫切要求出發，而是包辦代替與强迫命令。又稱：减租减息政策，由分區到縣，由縣到區，以至傳達到村幹部頭上，都是沒有地主，就鬥富農，沒有富農，就鬥中農，有的甚至門爭到貧農的頭上去，無限制的退租與淸理舊債；有的竟至淸理到光緒年間，又由淸債變爲淸理工賬，有的竟至請出其祖示三代的時代，因此不僅沒有把羣衆發動起來相反的大大的打擊了，羣衆的生產情緒，富農當然要縮小生產，甚至連翻了身買了地的貧僱農也不敢大胆生產，怕種的地多了要被鬥爭，羣衆認爲「這年月遷就過去不死就行」，以爲誰有了就要鬥誰，向羣衆頭上潑冷水，這是領導上的官僚主義。</p>

<h3>英美締盟的傳說</h3>
<p>倫敦「每日勞工報」一日載稱，英國不久將與美國締結軍事同盟條約，一俟亞力山大就任國防大臣之後，此項條約即將開始實施。這一個駭人聽聞的消息，雖經英國陸軍予以否認，但是我們硏究這個傳說的由來，不能不予以相當的重視。尤其是這幾天來，聯合國大會正在討論調查各國國外駐軍，者遍裁减軍備以及否決權的存廢等項間題的時候，成功湖上的彼瀾迭起，眞使我們爲世界的前途而擔憂。</p>
<p>昨天國民外交協會上海分會舉行座談會，以「國際現勢與中國一篇題，檢討世界形勢的演變以及我國外交的出路，所有參加座談的國際問題專家，對於今後國際的動向，莫不認爲今日的世界，已到了十字路口一條路是走向「一個世界」的，只要英業與蘇聯暨其他所有愛好和平國家通力合作，恢復戰時同心協力爭取勝利的精神來締造世界和平，必能使戰後的世界踏入「一個世界」的理想境界；另一道路是走向「兩個世界」的，觀察二次大戰結束以來各國政治的動向，很明顯的，英美與蘇聯的對立，有使今日的世界分裂而爲「兩個世界」的可能。在這兩個世界對立的形勢之下。世界決無和平可言。凡是愛好和平的各國，都不願「兩個世界」的見　事實。但是英美締盟的傳說，確能增加我們對於英美與蘇聯分道揚　的憂慮。　對比說，不得不予以密切的注視。</p>
<p>二次大戰結束後的世界，締造和平的工作，雖經各國政治外交家的努力，繼續不斷的進行；在這一年又四個月的時間內，國際上不知開了多少次的外長會議·巴黎會議，以及聯合國大會；但是眞正的和平，不僅還沒有降臨人間；而且這個世界與「和平之門」，愈走愈遠，使任何人都感覺到失望。看了這幾天聯合國大會開會的情形，更不能不認爲列强外交家在那裏「開玩笑」。世界現正站在十字路口，究將走向那一條道路？在成功湖的波瀾洶湧之下，益覺世界的前途的渺茫。再聽到英美將締結同盟的傳說，自然更要發生「迷惘」之感了。</p>
<p>英美締盟，以族種的，政治的，經濟的，軍事的，歷史的觀點而論，原不足詫異。英美同爲盎格魯撒克遜民族，血統語文相同，風俗習慣，也大體相似，根本就是拆不開的兩個國家；而且在第一第二兩次的世界大戰中，美國都不惜任何代價，站在英國方面參戰，均獲得光榮的勝利。所以在事實上，早就有一種「不成文的的盟約」存乎英美之間。假定新的戰爭不幸而爆發，英美即使不締結盟約，，美國必然的仍舊站在英國方面。但是世人聞及英美一締盟的傳說，爲什麽要還樣驚惶失措呢？這是因爲今日世界各國人民，於大戰之後，痛獲思痛，莫不認爲列強宜合而不宜分。在目下國際舞臺上，英美與美聯對立的形勢，雖已十分明顯，而且似已不可避免；但是各國政治外交致力於國際諒解與合作，仍不遺餘方，當不能認爲己經絕望。抑且大家都知道：英蘇如不能合作，歐洲即無和平希望，同樣英美與蘇聯如不能合作，則世界亦即無和平可言。聯合國大會刻正在成功湖畔開會，如何消除各國間的猜疑以及國際上所有的陰霾，不致分裂而爲「兩個世界」，而能促成「一個世界〕的實現，凡是愛好和平，渴望和平的各國人民，莫不　一致極大的期望，尤其希望聯合國大會能在友好的空氣中完成其任務；而今國際上散佈英美締盟的傳說，實在是一個對於聯合國大會極端不利的消息。</p>
<p>記得英國前任首相邱吉爾，於本年一年之內，迭次發表　說，一次在美國福爾登城演說，主張英合作；另一次在法國，主張英法同盟；又有一次在瑞士，主張法德合作。無不令人懷疑邱吉爾之流，企圖在組織西方集團，以與蘇聯相對抗；硬要把「一個世界」，分裂爲「兩個世界」。我國既希望戰後的世界步人和平民主的新時代，對於任何主張，凡足使世界　裂，形成集團對峙者，均不能贊同；本報亦曾一再加以評論，均認爲不適時宜，所以我們對於英美締盟的傳說，決不置信。英國工黨政府所采取的外交政策，雖乃保持了保守　的作風，但對於足以引起世界分感的外交舉動，決不致輕應從事；何况最近又有若干工黨議員，表示不滿意現行外交政策，而向下議院提出修正案，主張採取超然獨立的政策，要求政府採取一種「反對蘇聯共產主義同時又反對美國帝國主義」的政策，雖經下議院否決，但是無論如何，此舉終是對於工黨政府的一種警吿，使其對於今後所常採取的外交措施，更不能不愼重將事。</p>
<h3>英印會議的前瞻</h3>
<p>英國駐印總督魏菲爾偕同印度臨時政府副總理兼外長尼赫魯，回敎聯盟主席眞納曁財政部長阿里汗曁國防部長　格，同機飛往英國，業已行抵倫敦，英印圓桌會議。即將開幕，英國內閣會議，也已決定了該的議事日程。這是自從八月十六日加城大屠殺以來，英印回三方面第一次的共同會議。會塲霃遠在倫敦，可以避免羣衆感情的直接衝動，三方面代表可以遝用比較冷靜的頭腦，來處理這一個　複雜同時又急需解快的問題。</p>
<p>這一個會議召集成功是不容易的。在尼一赫魯印督　華爾的邀請，於九月一二日組織臨時政府的時候，回盟主席眞納不但不肯參加，反而訓令全印回敎徒於新政府成立之日，縣掛黑旗以示反抗，結果又繼續發生激烈的衝突。後來十月三日真納晉謁魏菲爾，態度忽變，毅然決定參加新政府。但是對於行將在十二月九日召集的制黨會議，真納忽又表示反對。魏菲爾與真納接洽，決定召集這次的倫敦　　會議。真納同意，尼赫魯又表示不願意出席，因爲恐怕躭誤制憲會議的召開，後來艾德禮首相願意担保印度制憲會議的成功，尼赫魯纔答應回行。</p>
<p>從上面這一串事實綜合觀察，我們可以知道這一次倫敦的圓桌會議，有三個根本問題：第一是回敎徒今後在印度政府中的地位；第二是尼赫魯對回敎徒可以讓舟到什麽限度？第三是英國政府對於印度是否允許她眞正的獨立。</p>
<p>回敎徒因爲人數不到一萬萬人，的合全印人口四分之一，在選舉上不能與印度人競爭。回敎徒現在要爭取的，就是巴基斯坦，也就是印回分治，回敎徒單獨成立巴基斯坦，或者在印度政府巾間，回敎徒能够多佔位置，以免印人倚仗多數對他們有任何不利的措施。眞納起初不　意參加臨時政府，現在不願意參加制憲會議，都是山於這一個動機。但是在尼赫魯方面，對於回盟自覺已經充分讓步，臨時政府中問，回敎徒共佔六席。將來制憲會議，亦可對於回敎徒方面，在憲法中特別規定，不便回教徒感覺壓迫。現在回盟根本不肯參加制憲會議，態度未免過於强硬，所以尼赫魯斥責回盟領袖有法西斯的作風，其理由也就此</p>
<p>除掉印回方面的衝突，最要緊的就是英國政府態度第一次世界大戰以後，英國自食允許印度獨立的諾霄。第二次世界大戰以後，各殖民地的民族遝動，風起雲湧，英國政府感覺不能完全採用武力壓迫的政策。對於印度，只有讓她獨立，還可以取得印人的好感，在軍事和經濟方面更可以保留重要的權利。所以英國准許印度獨立，並不是甘心情願，乃是迫於情勢，萬不得已。假如有機會能够多控制一日，她仍然要想盡方法，來維持　舊有的勢力。、</p>
<p>印回內內部的衝突，是印度獨立前途的致命傷。因爲假如印回一致團結，英國政府是沒有多少辦法的。印人可以照尼赫魯的主張，自己訓練國防軍，請英軍退回本國。商業方面，和蘇美携手，不讓英人　佔，印度的真正自由獨立，不難成功，但是印回的不合作，使英國政府得乘間施用分化的手段。在臨時政府組織的時候，眞納攻擊英國政府和尼赫魯合作，壓迫回敎徒。現在眞納同魏菲爾一度磋商，馬上加入新政府，此次又來一個倫敦愈議。在尼赫魯和印人的眼光看來，英國政府和回敎聯盟不免又有勾結的嫌疑了。听以尼　魯在開羅曾向　國親聞社記者談稱：「英軍如果撤離印度，　國民大會黨與回盟成立協議，當可較　容易。」</p>
<p>我們要奉　印回兩族，自立自主，不要受人愚弄。全印度的自由獨立，不能建築在內部的鬥爭上面，更不能建築在的扶持上面，只有團結纔能够發生力量，只有和平纔國家。同時對於英國工黨政府，我們也希望早日放棄過時的殖民地主義，和總統的勢力均衡，「分而治之」的政策。强權和詐術，在民族意職　　展的今日，已經不能再作維持大英帝國的良好工具。英國　政的眼光應當注視到將來。萬一將來國際上再有糾紛，印度三萬萬五千萬民案是否作英國人的朋友還是敵人，端看這次在倫敦圓桌會議中間，英國政府決定採取什麼態度。所以我們竭誠希望，經過這次英印回三方參加的圓桌會議之後，能商有成議，務使它於本月九日召開的制憲會議，得以如期開幕。</p>

<h3>皖省縣級財政困難　分區召開平衡會議</h3>
<p>〔本報合肥訊〕皖省省級財政，萬分支絀，縣級財政，尤爲困難，記者迭據來省各縣長談，縣級工作人員，及小學敎師，菲薄之薪補費，常有延至二三月，不能淸發者，且挪移彌補之虧空，亦常被縣參議會審査而否認，財廳爲解决縣級困難，已呈准省府，決定於十二月初，派員分赴蚌埠，蕪湖，安慶三市，召開縣級財政平衡會議，討論整理稅收，淸理公學產，及開源節流辦法，並規定蚌埠區會期，爲十二月五至七日，蕪湖區會期，爲十二月二十五至廿七日，安慶區會期，爲十二月廿至廿二日，蚌埠會出席者，爲皖東北，皖北，皖西二十五縣，蕪湖會出席者，爲皖東一部，及皖南全部廿三縣，安慶會出席者爲皖中及沿江北等十五縣，已電令全省十區專員，各縣市長，各財政機構主管人員，斯前趕到指定開會地點出席，聞財廳長濮夢九屆期亦趕往先後主持。</p>
<h3>皖省財政現況</h3>
<p>〔本報合肥訊〕皖省財政收支向來不敷平衡，自本年七月起，實行中央省（市），縣（市）三級制後，本省所得田賦（或土地稅）百分之廿，及營業稅百分之五十，數目太少，總計下半年各項收入可能不過三四十億元，而支出則達百億元，相警甚鉅，原定七·八·九三個月不敷數購由中央補助，但因收入短袖。即十·十一·十二·三個月，仍非中央補助不可。縣級財政自本年七月起，依照新牧支系統”除原有各項法定稅捐外，增劃田購（或土地稅）及營　稅各百分之五十，又契稅之全部歸縣，其收人較前充裕，惟因　係自治單位，一切自矜事業開展所需經費甚鉅，就本年下半年度計之，全省各縣支出約三百餘億元，而收入僅入十餘億元，收支懸殊甚大，故目前省縣財政，同屬支絀。財政廳對本省財政如何開源，如何節流，均在緻密規劃中，對於各縣徵收機構，接辦省縣各項稅捐，均已辦竣，機構名稱定爲「稅捐稽征處」，以別於原有之各縣「稅捐征收處」，分爲五等，視其全年徵收數額多寡而定等級，所用員役多寡，亦視此爲比例。廳長濮孟九對於各稅捐稽征處主持人選，極爲愼重，任用原則計分爲四種，（一）原任稅捐徵收處主任，成績卓著者連任之，（二）原任中央稅局移交省級，而成績優良者，酌予留用，（三）曾任財政工作，經騐豐富而成債優良者，派充之，（四）各方介紹者選任之。另訂任用及獎懲辦法，期將本省稅政納入正軌。</p>

<p>運柩辦法還望改善</p>
<p>第一函　自從本市衛生局清除市區內積柩消息傳佈以後，一般柩屬不無感覺徬徨。據報載目前本市積柩，達十萬具之多，其數字足以駭人，究其達到此巨數之原因，要不外抗戰八年以來，覊旅於本市人民衆多，家屬身故，料理棺　，已覺困難，遑有餘力，購地營葬，加以四郊未靖，交通梗阻縱有扶柩回籍之心，而環境不許，何况柩屬旣多覊旅人士，其原籍斷非一蹴可達，値此物力艱難之際，欲其即籌鉅款，辦理搬運，殊非易易，於此可知其寄柩久而不運者，自有其不得已之苦衷。</p>
<p>我國民性淳樸，仍多墨守安葬祖塋，及父母合葬等種種傳統觀念，當局雖許以三數月之寬展時期，柩屬是否盡能如期辦理，否則轉瞬限期屆滿，竟遭當局以無主屍柩付之一炬，似對於其奉安之心，及中國舊禮敎孝義之道，未能深予同情，不無遺憾。</p>
<p>衛生當局重以數百萬人民聚集之地，包藏如許之屍柩，爲市民健康着想，自宜澈底淸除，且已爲各柩屬打算，展限至明年三月不可謂設想不週，此後柩屬能力可及者，自應及早舉行，一則服從功令，一則了却本人義務，切不可再事因循，自貽伊戚，但一般能力薄弱之柩屬，經濟固已爲難，或以交通不便，或以原籍仍爲兵匪所踞，不易舉辦者，似仍應籲請當局，再予寬放時日，能否准於原寬展限期內，先從事將本市中心區內各殯儀館及寄柩所之存柩，漸次淸除，其在本市各邊區之寄柩所及丙舍存柩，再作第二步之撤除，期於一年之內，完成整個計劃，則該柩屬旣可有機俟時局轉趨安定，便利運送，又可籌劃相當款項，以資搬運費用，公私兩得其益矣，蒭蕘之見仍希當局賜予採納。（汪慕　）</p>
<p>第二函　我的友人是漢口籍，他的岳母死在上海，寄柩在滬西殯儀舘裏，最近聽到市府衛生局發表，所以主張運返原籍，經過了覓舖保向警局裏打護照，到檢疫所領檢疫單，到海關裏報了關，按照國營招商局的規章，辦竣了手續，徼倖的提單也領到了，就把柩車向輪埠裝運，不料問題又來了，碼頭上扛夫，大開其獅子口，扛上船要國幣十幾萬元，扛到船裏又要十幾萬元，管理的另加也要化錢，並且還不能自己雇了別的工人來扛强横無理兼而有之，局方又置之不理，這樣的費事而且化費也很大，市府擬在本年底出清積柩的一個辦法我猜想起來：又將受到事實的陣碍而不能貫澈了，因爲多數的貧苦小民，那裏負担得了　所以也祗好眼看着的任其被火葬了，現在我來一個多餘的要求市府把上述的麻煩手續能不能改革簡化一點，招商局旣然是國營，應該這種扛夫，對他們胡亂地敲索也應該有一個嚴厲的制止辦法，並設法改良一下，希望有關機關裏的負責人，多多地替小民謀點福利，那麽市政府的辦法或許就可以實踐了！（嘵舌）</p>
<h3>籲請注意南市治安</h3>

<h3>德境佔區統一經濟　英美兩國簽訂協定　平均分担費用置德國於自給基礎</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山三日廣播：美國務卿貝爾納斯與英外相貝文同時宣佈：德境內英美經濟合併。貝爾納斯並稱，在紐約外長會議結束前，渠將請求英蘇法外長討論對奧德兩國之和的。</p>
<p>〔聯合社紐約二日電〕據國務院宣布：美國務卿貝爾納斯與英外長貝文，今日在此問簽訂各該國在德境佔領區經濟上合併協定，俾在三年內能使各該區經濟自給自足。此本曾在柏林，華盛頓及此間談判甚久，今始吿一段落。惟蘇法兩國佔領區尙無參加之象。兩星期來之特別談判者，爲德境美佔領軍司令克萊及英佔領軍司令羅賓遜。克萊昨自華盛頓携草的抵此，即由貝爾納斯今晨與貝文作最後審査，並無異議，旋即簽字。其內容暫緩公布，以待明日下午由英國方面提請衆院核准。據倫敦訊，使德境英美佔領區三年來經濟自立計劃，須費十萬美元，可由兩國分担，惟採購設備及接濟時不能限於金元國集團。</p>
<p>〔聯合社紐約三日電〕美國務卿貝爾納斯與英外長貝文今日商定將新近締結之德境英美佔領區經濟合併協定公佈，此乃聯合國開始佔領德境以來最微劇之變動。合併辦法或將使明年度美國佔領德境所耗費用增加一億美元左右。但美官員稱，佔領費用增加，理由充足，因美英兩區集合資源，可望於三年內自給自足，法蘇佔領區均不受影響。貝爾納斯與貝文於昨夜簽訂此協定，聞合併計劃曾通知蘇法，但此兩國並未提出任何建議，使成爲三國或四國間之協定。蘇外長莫洛托夫並未直接參與此事，但傳柏林蘇方代表已在試探德國全境經濟統一之可能性。</p>

<p>〔美國新聞處成功湖二日電〕美國今日向聯大會建議要求弗朗哥下野，以政權讓與廣泛代表西班牙人民之西班牙臨時政府，而該政府將負責舉行眞正之自由選舉。此項建議係由美代表康納利向大會政治及安全委會所提出。康納利並主張禁止現行弗朗哥政權參加任何與聯合國有關之國際機構，在另一方面則對西班牙人民表示「同情」，　請彼等促成西班牙加入聯合國之資格。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社成功湖二日電〕聯大政治安全委會今日開會，討論西班牙問題，美代表康納利提議，弗朗哥政權一日存在，西班牙一日不得參加聯合國各機構。白俄羅斯代表進一步要求對弗朗哥政權實施經濟制裁，强迫其放棄權力。波蘭代表藍琪要求與西班牙斷絕外交關係。瓜地瑪拉·委內瑞拉與烏拉圭均對弗朗哥政權表示敵意。但菲律賓代表則表示不能接受波蘭與白俄羅斯之提案，因對西關係一旦斷絕，西現牙人民將感覺侮辱，其結果將與預期相反，故宜採取美國之修正案，不干涉西班牙內政，聽由西國人民自救，選擇其所欲之政府</p>
<h3>十四國小組討論　否決權問題</h3>
<p>〔路透社紐約成功湖三日電〕政治委會之十四國小組委員會，昨經五小時之討論後就否決權問題仍未能成立協議，印度代表梅農建議，聯合國全體大會應向安理會建議，本過去數月中之經騐及可得敎訓，採取適常之方法，使理事會得以通過成議，而履行盡章所授予之重大責任。該小組會之任務，在就六項決議草案中，擬具一個決議案。</p>
<h3>原子能管制　美蘇意見未一致</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社成功湖二日電〕聯大會政治及安全委會本日繼續討論裁减軍備問題，由美代表康納利員發言稱，任何管制原子能之計劃，凡以否決權阻止調查各國情形者，美國均不能予以接受，任何受否決權限制之管制計劃均不能成爲有效。蘇聯所提出之計劃，其目的或僅在禁止原子彈，但美國所提出之計劃，則將管制機構之範圍予以擴大，使其對於不論何種武器均能實施管制。至此蘇代表維辛斯基起立答覆稱，若干國家在戰時物資消耗甚鉅者，固有其發言權，但尙有其他國家在戰時喪生命無算者，更有其發言權。美蘇兩國對於裁减軍備所提出之計劃，其目的均在廢止原子彈，州蘇聯之計劃，亦規定全國應實行普遍裁軍。余茲提議本委會應暫停討論裁軍問題，　蘇聯代表團能將　國之建議，予以縝密之硏究。</p>
<p>〔路透社成功湖二日電〕英代表蕭克魯斯昨在聯大會政治委會中，曾謂將有較原子彈更可怖之武器。本社記者事後請其就該語加以申述蕭氏僅曰，科學家現正從事研究極具破壞力之武器成功以後，將使原子彈降至次要地位。細菌戰之硏究，目前尙未爲外人所注意，故公衆不應僅注意原子彈一項，不可以爲在未來戰爭中原子彈必仍爲最可怖之武器。</p>
<h3>託管草約修正案　紐西蘭已予接受</h3>

<h3>高生大被毀　博得同情心　一位猶太人贈美金五元　大美晚報同人捐十萬</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕高生大紙號被暴徒搗毀焚燒，這幾天來，無疑地已成了上海一件大新聞，作爲談話評論的資料。可是高生大雖然在物質受到了一個莫大的損失，但在精神上他們是應該覺得安慰的。</p>

<h3>納粹殘暴·猶未忘懷</h3>
<p>這位不肯具名的猶太人看到高生大的不幸遭遇，昨天特地送了一封信，附着五元美金，到英文美晚報。這封信不但表示了他對高生大店主高成錫的痛惜，同時也十足哭訴了猶太人的無家之苦，信內說：「我對高生大被害感到萬分的同情，因爲任一九三八年，我和許多無辜的猶太人在德國，也遭到了同樣的摧殘。可是我們和高氏所受到的悲劇有點不同的，是我們既沒有警察保護，更得不到人發和政府的同情。整個的猶太人都是被蔑福遺棄的。</p>
<p>我們感謝中國能伸出手來帮助我們，讓我們在這裏有棲身的機會，這表示了中國人的厚恩，也可證明中國和中國的人民前途一定無量。所以我深深地同情高生大此次被暴徒所毁，謹寄上美金五元致贈高氏，以表示我菲　之意。我很想多捐助一些，可是我無能爲力！」</p>

<h3>探索藏金之謎　再勘復興島忽有新發現　泥地埋有整兇日貨水泥　包皮紙竟還完整未腐爛</h3>
<p>〔本報特寫〕復興島藏金疑案，是個謎樣的故事。密吿人具名呌「楊弼亞」，他以百折不撓的精神，到處吿密，可是誰也沒有見過這位神秘的幕後人物。他的密報中詳細地叙述復興島中日軍曾建下秘密隧道，隱藏着價値二千萬美金的物資，還有隱埋在土中二大浴缸的金條。他又說明浴缸中的金條怎樣被人發現，朋分侵吞。隧道中的物資，每天用二十輛到三十輛大卡車載遝，連續運輸一個多月。淞滬警備司令部，軍政部，接收工作淸査團，和主席的呈訴箱，都曾接到過這個密吿，各機關也都下過一番調査工夫，可是情形太離奇了，一年來還得不到一個頭緒。這次地方法院檢察處負起了偵査的任務，娥辦檢察官顧宏標，曾經在上月十九日上午親自到島上察看了一番，前天顧檢察官從南京回來，忽又傳出了顧檢警官決定在昨天作第二次的親自勘察。</p>
<p>追蹤抵復償島</p>
<p>記者在昨天清晨得了這個消息，便乘車迫踪前往。昨天天氣比較暖和，暖和普卡在朔風中飛駛，倒還不覺得刺骨的寒冷。過外自渡橋，楊樹浦路，定海橋，前面就是復興島了。定海橋上有海軍守衛，輕易不能通過，記者掏出了名片，說明了事由才准放行。過了橋便是復興島的土地了，一條不十分平坦的煤屑路，的有三四里長，汽車要走十多分鐘。沿途滿佈着崗位，荷槍實彈的都是穿黑色制服，戴無邊平頂帽的中國海軍。路的盡頭顯現出大門，上面橫着一個大同額，寫着「復興漁業」四個大字。顧檢察官一行正在前面緩緩行着，跟顧檢察官同去的有楊書記官，許翻譯官，及四位法警；同時還會同了行總余委員，淞滬警備司令部王股長，滬北稽査所似査科長宣匯凡，吳士沂等人。設在島上的行總　業管理處副處長王以康，總務組長李經平，事務科長李雲鵬，及技術委員王千里等，熱忱招待，先到復興大樓。這座四層樓的建築物，日本海軍陸戰隊曾作爲司令部。勝利前復興島根本就是敵海軍的一個大兵營，所以也曾遭受到明國空軍猛列轟炸。這座復興大樓當然是轟作的目標，雖經修理，但還是殘敗破陋，滿地斷磚裂木。漁業處就在這裏辦公，三樓新佈置的會客室，相當精緻，昨天人多了些，顯得太小了。</p>
<p>兩個人的談話</p>
<p>行總技術委員王千里，高大　子，方型的臉，蓄着一撮小鬍子說話慢昨斯理，聽了敎人很舒服。他從復興島的沿革史，談到勝利後的接收史。他說：「復興島是從黃浦江底挖起來的泥沙，歷年堆積成的。民國二十五年實業部在島上建築碼頭房屋，後關爲漁市塲。去年勝利歸來，因爲這島敵海軍設防爲陸戰隊的根據地，所以山海軍接收。同時用作日僑日俘的集中營。當時在島的部隊多而且雜，有海軍，第三方面軍，眾政部外賓處，保安隊，聯合後勤司令部等。行總的漁船到上海後，因爲無處停泊，故商借該寫作爲基地。最先來的是李雲鵬科長等一批，那是今年五月底之事。這時候島中尙有日僑俘八九千人，戰俘管理處及海線軍守衛　嚴，行總人員居住在復興大樓中，不能到各處亂跑，所以隧道中的物資，洛缸中的黃金，究竟有沒有，我們就無從知道了。」　戴皮帽身材碩長的李經平組長，談到浴缸問題，他說：「大槪是七月十五日至十八日，經過一塲暴雨之後，工友來報吿土中發現了一隻浴缸。白瓷的盆邊露出土外，裏而盡是糞土。同日因爲修理自來水管又發現第二隻浴缸，內中也爲糞土，並無金條。」</p>
<p>發現埋著水泥</p>
<p>的在十點鐘左右，我們開始實地察看，由李經平，李雲鵬二位引導，先至第一隻浴缸埋藏處，確有一個低窪，但並不大，不過三尺多深，兩邊種着冬靑樹。正在大家注目於低窪的時候，不知那一位，忽然在距低窪數步前，發覺了異樣，因爲這裏的土，竟是軟綿綿而有彈性的。於是便決定發掘，泥土那麼的鬆，夾雜許多柴草木板，顯然是不久前塡塞的。奇怪的是掘不到三尺，忽發現裏邊竟充滿已硬化了的整包水泥，水泥的包紙還沒腐爛呢。從包皮紙上我們鑑別出還是「日本貨」。水泥一塊又一塊，掘不勝掘，時間已經下午一點鐘了，大家已餓得發慌。行總漁管處爲我們準備好了午餐。</p>
<p>一連串的疑問</p>
<p>乘午餐的空閑，我們共同硏究這件案子。因實在太複雜而曲折，爲便於討論起見，把它分作二部份。先就藏金的一部份說，立刻想到了一連串的問題：金子是不怕腐爛的，何必要藏在浴缸中，再埋在地？浴缸那裏來的？爲何埋在地下？如不作藏危，又作何用呢？糞那裏來的？爲何浴缸要盛糞？這一大堆的問題，使全塲陷入沉悶的空氣中。飯後再視察第二隻浴缸埋藏處，也不過一個低窪，沒有新發現。顧檢察官傳問最先發現浴缸的修自來水工人王奎。王奎說：「這裏原來都盛長着草，因爲自來水管壞了，我來修理，發見瓷盆的白邊露在外邊，二隻同樣發現的。」據他的記憶，那天並不下雨，不過因水管壞了。所以遍地是水。顧檢察官等巡視了一週，再回到復興火樓的會客室巾，傳訊汽車司機李金標。李是與李雲鵬科長差不多同時來島上的，他否認曾經載運過物資。</p>
<p>時間已下午四時，還是毫無結論。島中道路縱橫，撲朔迷離。我們行行止止。整整費了十個鐘頭，大家都已有點倦意。順便參觀了一下行總漁船，便乘車回來。復興島的物資與金條，依然還是個謎。（上圖爲發見之浴缸）復</p>

<h3>何應欽海外來書　贊同本報社論意見　跑馬廳闢作公園</h3>

<h3>糧食南貨切麵等三業　勞次爭執社局昨調處</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市勞資糾紛，層出不窮，社局調解科門庭若市。昨日下午在社會局進行調處者，有下列三起：</p>
<p>米業　及雜糧業勞方要求改善待遇，主要條件如下：（一）工人待遇分四十五元。三十元。五十五元。六十元。四等，均依市政府生活指數計算。送力定爲每石一角，亦應依指數計算。（二）紅利應四六對拆，資六勞四。全年薪金爲十五個月，三個月作爲年賞。（三）職工福利由勞資兩方協商舉辦，費用之負擔按勞工法辦理。（四）工人疾病時，醫藥費由資方負擔，並照付工資。（五）不得無故開除工人。（六）資方今後僱用工人，應限於工會之會員。昨日勞資雙方在社會局談判時，因意見相去懸殊，致大起爭執。雙方代表發言時，曾拍桌以加强　勢。按此業之勞資糾紛，十月份即已發生，屢經談判，迄未得解決方案。</p>
<p>南貨　業在八月間曾發生勞資糾紛，經社會局調處後，於八月十五日成立和解筆錄，其中規定職員之待遇，依甲乙丙三等分別增加底薪二十元。十五元。十元，並按生活指數計算。但有六十六家南貨店，迄今尙未履行筆錄，資方之理由爲營業不振，無力負担。現此事已由工會提請社會局調處，勞方要求先將八月十五日至十一月十五日問之三個月薪水，按新標準發給，然後再由工會代表與社會局代表會同調査商店營業實况，如屬虧損，工人願將工資折扣支付。昨日雙方代表談判時，資方代表謂須與該業理事長洽商後，方能有所決定。</p>
<p>切麵　業公會於今年九月間訂定該業工人之標準工費爲十一萬元，凡由工會介紹就業之工人，待遇均依此數支付。但當時一部份麵館主人因急於供應冷麵，願出高工資以僱用工人，於是遂產生十五萬元之「黑市工資」，目前黑市已較工會規定數高出七八萬元。加以一般麵館之僱用工人，均不願由工會介紹，於是加入工會之工人大爲不滿，勞資糾紛遂起。勞方初要求將底薪訂爲三十元，三十五元。四十元三等，均按生活指數計算。經折　後，雙方議定凡機器切麵店其每日工作能力在七包麵粉以下者，工人之底薪定爲二十七元，在七包麵粉以上者，工人之底薪定爲三十元。年賞問　亦附帶在昨日調處時解決，資方同意工人之年賞最少爲半個月，至於如何支配，仍由資方秉公處理。此項談判，始終在和平之空氣下進行，與米糧業恰成一有趣之對照。工務局長昨日招待</p>
<h3>美工程家應聘來華</h3>
<p>工務局長昨日招待</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕務局長趙祖康，昨午四時，在該局招待甫自美來華之工程專家雷飽特中將（Lt．Cenetal　Eugene　Reybold）及格　頓上校（Col．J．P．Growden），彼等係受我國政院長最高經濟委員會之聘，來華考察　河工程者，途經上海，即將赴京向行政院報到。彼等對於本市之都市計劃，浦江造橋，興築隧道等交換意見頗爲具體，並對於工務局之工作成績及未來計劃等均表滿意，尤其對於發展浦東港口計劃。</p>

<h3>時艱民窮　豬肉銷路慘澹</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕最近本中猪肉市價尙爲平穩，猪行業與鮮肉業批發商，按日根據供求情形，協商發售價格。以昨日而論，毛豬每公斤三千四百元，即每市斤一千七百元；鮮肉批發，每市斤二千六百五十元，肉攤零售則視肥瘠，自每市斤二千五百元至三千元左右不等。</p>
<p>猪隻來源頗爲暢通，仍以蚌埠等地淮猪爲多。除大部份係直接　上海外，亦有運至無錫常州等地，俟上海市價有利可圖時，即在當地宰割後，將鮮肉運滬出售。如此則獲利較多，且可銀貨兩訖。因普通猪販，以毛猪出售者，往往須隔三四日始能收到價款也。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕由於天氣轉寒，本市多數裝有電熱火表住戶，使用電火爐，致使本市電力供應情形，大爲困難。前日下午五時，上海電力公司將本市全部紗廠用電拉光，此種恐慌情形，爲本年度從未有者。由於住戶違禁使用電火爐，每日電力消耗突增一萬二千至一萬五千瓩，等於每日工廠用電之三分之一，意即每日之生產量减少三分之一。電力公司急切呼籲本市住戶合作，切勿使用電火爐。</p>
<p>關於本市住戶每月電熱及電燈之使用限度通知單，各電力公司已陸續發出，各住戶於收到通知單後，務須依照限度使用，逾限者，各電力公司將依市府規定，予以斷電處分。</p>
<p>本年六、七、八、九、四個月，每月使用電熱不滿二十度者，電力公司已將該項火表剪斷，現已剪去二千隻。超過二十度者，以四月中用度最高之一月，爲新限額。</p>
<h3>冬今救濟　可能提前實行</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市冬令救濟委員會委員蔡殿榮昨吿記者：本市之冬令救濟，中央明令於本月十五日起實施，但本市正斟酌天氣情形，可能提早一週實行。預計今冬受救濟之人數，的在三千左右，必要時可收容至五千人。經費已決定爲四億元，在市庫支絀之際，撥出此款，已屬不易。但此項救濟工作，費用浩繁，估計每人之禦寒設備，至少需八萬元，另外需供給三個月之膳食。目前衣被已準備好八百套，其餘亦在趕製中。在冬季收容期間，管理爲一重要問題，因限於設備，不便實施職業訓練，但當斟酌實情，每日予以適當工作，不使其過於閒暇。在舊曆年底時，並將贈送寒衣。又今冬救濟時，將儘量請社會上各善慈團體合作，以求事半功倍。</p>

<h3>原棉供給問題　宋院長限兩日以內　提供五項統計　存棉填報不確查明即予沒收　棉紗黑市着先擬具取締方案</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕行政院宋院長於昨日上午十一時，主持召開第十四次紡管會臨時會議。到兼主委吳國楨。副生委李升伯。委員束雲章，吳味經。王啓宇。　海·王仰先·楊錫仁·林鳳苞。榮鴻元，及紡管會業務處長劉文騰。列席者有中央銀行總裁員祖詒，顧問麥克等。討論歷一小時，即吿散會。</p>
<p>昨日會議席上，宋院長面諭二點：（甲）爲供給原棉問題，擬徴集統計資料五項：（一）全國所產之原棉量。（二）可供各紗廠紡紗所用之原棉量。（三）谷紗廠。花行，及洋行目前之存棉量。（四）目前我國全部紗錠每年對原棉之需要量。（五）除我國目前可用國國棉，及各紗廠。花行洋行之存棉外，尙不敷之原棉量。爲早日搜集資料計，並統限各紗廠·花行，及洋行，於明日（五日）以前，將本身迄本年十一月底之存棉量，造表報吿紡管會，俾便集中統計。如査有塡報不確，其未報之存棉，將予沒收處分。（乙）如何取締棉紗黑市。關於此點，宋院長請各與會委員，提供意見。各委員常先後表示一過。旋決定精紡管會各位對紡織事業有經騐之委員，擬具具體管理紗布之方案，提交本週四召開之第十五次紡管會例會中討論，然後將結果報告宋院長核定。</p>
<p>昨日紡管會即函委員王啓宇，略稱：奉宋院長而諭：關於如何調節紗布市塲，消滅墨市一節，應先提供具體方案，以憑核奪等因，相應函請台端負責提供意見書，於太星期四（十二月五日）本會第十五次會議時，付諸討論爲荷。</p>
<p>記者旋訪參加昨日紡管會議之王啓宇氏，承吿：宋院長以過去棉紗配銷政策失敗，蓋民衆旣未受實惠，而紗廠又多受限價之掣肘，然棉紗黑市，仍未能因此而消滅。故囑各與會委員，擬具抑平紗價之辦法。渠本人目前尙未擬有　體辦法，惟終嫌本市原棉價格太高，美棉又已多月未准結匯。此後返望能充厚本市原棉存底·務使原棉能源源運到，俾紡紗原料，不致短缺。至棉紗對策，以我國幅員之廣，全而管制，固然困難。然單獨管制上海之棉紗，亦未見有良好之效果。即一時恢復自由買賣，亦非一蹴可就之事。故渠希望能在恢復自由買賣前，求一合理之棉紗出路。惟此純係渠個人之意見，具體意見，固有待各關係方面會商後，方能定奪云。</p>
<p>宋院長旋於下午四時許，又召集紡管會兼主席　國　。委員束云章，楊錫任，林鳳苞，吳味經，中央銀行顧問麥克等談話，迄七時許，始吿散會。聞談話內容，注重：（一）如何加　收購國棉。（二）如何减輕原棉之打包費用，及解除打包之困難。（三）如何暢通原棉之運輸辦法。（四）棉紗配銷之具體辦法等。</p>
<p>宋院長並曾垂詢棉紗之生產成本甚詳，並爲供給購買美棉之外匯問題，徴詢央行貝總裁之意見。貝總裁當表示：供應購買美棉之外匯，可無問題。惟望能積極加強我國出口物資如桐油，茶，絲等之外銷，同時通過修正之進出口貿易辦法，加强管理進口貨品，則對我國外匯前途，當極可樂觀云。</p>
<p>聞政府將先發動訂購大批美棉，以充實原棉存底，俾减低原料成本，紗價亦得賴以抑平云。</p>
<h3>宋院長召集臨管會　檢討該會工作情形</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕行政院宋院長，於昨日上午九時，在外灘中行大樓，召開一輸人臨時管委會委會。到主委貝祖　，執委張福運，陳長桐，李　，林　英，及央行業務局長林鳳苞等。宋氏當檢討該會成立以來之工作經過。旋即開始討論各頃問題，舉其犖犖大者，如：（一）輸入品分類核定數　及各別核定數量之原則。（二）對業已啓運來滬途中之貨品，應如何補具手續。（三）進出口商登記審定之方針。（四）恢復申請結匯後，分配匯額之問題。各問題均經討論一過，會議迄十時許，始吿散</p>
<p>又臨管會執委會經費，業經宋院長核定，由中央銀行撥付云。</p>
<h3>公債續降</h3>
<p>公債昨七樓某戶有售，低價經銀行方面稍納，疲後轉盤，統丙晨開一三四〇元，自一三六〇元起盤降至一二四〇元，近午回升至一三〇〇元以上盤旋，結果較前收下降七十元，甲乙亦跌五元，丁挫二十元，戊降四十元。</p>
<h3>油价在跌　米市鑒定雜糧平穩</h3>
<p>米市到銷兩不見旺，南粳略升三五百元，北粳亦活絡，白元陰元仍少榮辱，秈米平定，麵粉銷路雖懈，但廠方以麥價堅挺，成本關係，不肯賤售，麩皮呆平，豆餅閩方稍動，市面亦少上落，生仁南洋仍懈，高定次疲，芝蔴廣帮續動，依然穩固，菉豆亦頗俏俐，紅糧貨稀，消化活潑，黃豆本街揀巧進取，微升三五百元，缸豆汕頭仍辦，形勢穩定，油市各路相繼湧到，消路呆滯，一蹶不振，績見在跌，各油再挫六七千元。</p>
<h3>茶市不易樂觀</h3>
<p>洋莊茶市，高檔陳祁門穩中帶堅，其他花色，過程均虛靜，至於紅綠茶內銷，本　及客帮仍鮮起色，且受天津茶市頽疲之影響，人心亦因之　　，照此情形而論，茶市前途終難樂觀。</p>
<h3>紗布均告回落</h3>
<p>昨日紗市轉趨下游，緣連日所漲甚巨，反較內地爲高，明日又逢紡建開紗期，紗　　根不寬，亟謀出龍，是以廿支紗回小五七萬，四十二支狂落廿萬，走化殊狹。</p>
<p>棉布行市漲風漸趨平息，各帮去路呆滯，散戶逢高吐售，六日開盤賣戶四起，各檔坯布嗶嘰逐步下　，五福細布九萬四千五百元，彩球細布九萬三千五百元，陽鶴細布九萬一千元，嗶嘰新金印十萬零九午元，金　妙舞嗶嘰十萬零九千元，坯布嗶嘰較昨皆軋小一二千元不等。</p>
<h3>糧食業各公會　分別改組歸併</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據悉：本市與糧食有關之各商業同業公會，自下　起，將加改組。聞荳米行業，米號業，及米糧經售萊，將歸併爲一，定名爲米商業同業公會。雜糧油餅業，及雜糧油餅零售業兩公會，將加改組，分設爲雜糧商業，及油商業兩同業公會。麵粉麩皮業將改爲麵粉商業同業公會。碾米工業同業公會則仍照舊云</p>
<h3>華股籌碼涸竭　市價挫落有限</h3>
<p>華股昨成交更稀，市價恍惚不定，空方壓力甚重，但以現貨籌碼極缺，低後尙易回升，晨開以銀根吿緊各股見低，開後二二三號八九號二二四號均售而續低，十時後經九二號九七號一五二號二一五號等來進，曾回升十餘元，終以一〇二號一八五號二七號出現永紗，二三三號一八〇號一七七號出遞永紗，現交一度退至四五〇元以下，此　因八〇號三八號一六二號一五一號有進，尙有回升力，無如一八〇號在四六〇元光景，不斷壓迫，二八號三五號二二九號再售，掙扎之下復降至低價，十一時半復軋空較殷，聞塲外空方過多，無息可收，多方亦祗貼息四分半，人心亦好，九一號三六號一五二號四四號等均進，近午稍現漲風，結果較前收計永紗信和新光勤興華豐各跌少許至半成弱，美亞景福各跌半成强，冷股大通統益平平，中絲回好半成强，餘均微挫，遞交永紗美亞勤興各跌半成左右餘均微降，午後賡續買風佔盛，人心轉堅，檯面帮有進，買戶雖屬零星，但積少成多，籌碼涸竭，易於拉上，大戶若一七六號二二三號二一五號雖售，難止買氣，中途多盤，臨收仍榮，收後喊價尙繼續扳高，結果較前收計永紗美亞景福新光勤興華豐微挫，信和微升，冷股中絲以午前成交價較，升起半成强，大通微升，統益見平外，餘微挫，遞交永紗美亞新光動興華豐微挫，信和稍升，塲外各股平疲殊微。</p>
<p>外股昨仍在無人維持下，賡續見疲，結果較前收會德豐業廣鋼業平平，怡啤微升，怡紗英聯跌半成光景，餘微挫。</p>
<h3>糖價上落甚微</h3>
<p>昨糖市交易稍增，趨勢平穩，公會劃盤現貨，中砂白十三萬四千元，生砂赤十一萬五千五百元，均升五百元，汕帮開冲提靑十萬元，次棉赤十萬〇五六千元至八千元，建帮刁靑九萬七千元，漳赤十萬〇二千元，廣帮潤德靑十萬元，與化帮開貢白十三萬四千元至二千元，與赤十八千一萬元至十二萬元，統共成交三四百件。</p>
<h3>秋絲將開始收購　惟價格標準極難確定　中蠶當局正在研究中</h3>
<p>政府爲扶持蠶絲業，對於國產生絲特飭由中信局予以收購，春絲價格曾由中蠶公司根據實際成本，加子合法利潤，以Ｄ級爲標準，擬定價格，每擔爲三百八十萬元，自開始收購以來，春絲已收至八成以上，即將吿一段落，目前又將展開收購秋絲之工作，惟秋絲成本，與春絲成本相差極大，據第三區繅絲工業公會所估計之成本，的爲六百卅餘萬元，其成本之估計方法，以繭本繅工利息三種支付爲根據，第一繭本，七擔繭繅絲一擔，乾繭每擔收價六十一萬五千，合爲四百卅萬　五千元，第二繅工，至低一百四十四萬元，第三利息，以五分行息，一個月計算，應付五十七萬四千五百元，合計如上數，認爲最低之成本，與春絲收價相比，幾增一倍，該會理事長褚輔成，已分呈蔣主席及政府宋院長請示，據悉：秋絲收購價格，仍由中蠶公司擬定，該公司正調査實際成本，再訂一合理之標準價格，報請核示，據中蠶總經理葛敬中表示，秋絲與春絲情形不同，因春　與秋繭價格互易，成本當有高低，且各地米價工資亦有懸殊，標準極難確定，而秋絲價高，又係事實，公司正根據各地實際成本，加以研究，要以扶助廠商爲原則，決顧其生產成本，不使賠本吃虧，秋絲價格之訂定，當力求合理云。</p>
<h3>央行明配暗售　金價漲風稍定</h3>
<p>烚赤昨因銀根初緊繼鬆，央行亦頻加壓力，高後多盤，晨開二七五萬二，開後即升，爭貿仍烈，不久漲高至二七六萬五左右，中行逢高壓迫，遂吿回落，銀根亦緊，十時後央行以二七三萬之價，配售一〇一條，明配暗售之下，曾跌落至二七二萬以下，始獲維持，銀根亦漸鬆動，午刻回升至二七三萬五左右，午後賡續向榮，曾回升至二七五萬五以上，結果較前收微挫五千，飾金紋銀銀元均平，暗拆銀根稍緊，暗息在一角半左右。</p>
<h3>調味粉業要求　禁止外貨進口　臨管會允予考慮</h3>
<p>上海市調味粉工業同業公會，以外貨調味粉源源輸入，充斥市塲，影饗本國調味粉工業至鉅，特向輸入品臨時管理委員會要求，禁止外貨調味粉入口，並陳述各點理由，請予核准，輸入。品臨管會對該業所陳各點均表同情，業於昨日函復該會，允予考慮，並令報吿外貨調味粉輸入情形及其種類牌品，稅率號碼等，各項詳細調査統計，以便審核，該會刻正積極編製各種調査表，本週內當可送呈備審。</p>
<h3>絲業界一喜訊　美需要大批絲綢　中信局允供給各廠原料</h3>
<p>我困苦之絲業，目前正在尋覓出路，以成本過高，前途仍極渺茫，即中信局奉命收購之生絲，依然陷於苦悶之中，頃悉：陳納德將軍所組織之中美公司，近受美進口商之請托，需要大批我國絲綢，　爲洽辦，陳納德即派人與我絲綢廠家接洽，各廠商恐原料成問題，乃商於中信局供給原料，中信局願以收購生絲盡量供給，各廠商已表示願意接受訂貨，現待美方將其需用花色開列詳單及數量來此後，即與之訂立合約，定期交貨，開美方購買數量，在二十萬疋以上，我垂危之絲業，能將生絲加工出口，政府絲商均蒙其利，實屬一空前喜訊，我絲業界人士莫不振奮。</p>
<h3>法幣對各國貨幣　央行規定换算路</h3>
<p>法幣與各劉貨幣換算率，經中央銀行規定者爲美金與英鎊兩很，美金官定滙率係三三五〇元，英鎊每鎊則合法幣一三五〇〇元，其他各國貨幣之換算率。央行尙未規定，僅以各該　貨幣對美金或金鎊之比價計算，折合法幣，頗有出入，茲悉央行有鑒於斯，爲求劃一各國貨幣兌換率起見，已通吿各指定經營外匯銀行、對各國貨幣之换算率規定如次：（一）港幣一先令一一，九三七五便士折合一英鎊（二）法國法郞五百法郞等於一英鎊，（三）瑞士法郞十三法郞等於一英鎊，（四）比利時法郞一百八十法郞等於一英鎊。（五）盧比一先令五，九三一七五便士等於一英鎊，（六）新加坡叨幣二先令四便士等於一英鎊，（七）荷幣十一單位合英一鎊（八）暹幣八十單位合一英鎊，（九）埃及二五，五單位合一英鎊，聞存於國內銀行之外幣存款，央行即按上項換算率付給存户云。</p>
<h3>折合率提高粗纱又多　複配會配紗困難　各廠實配在四成左右　四十二支漲價未實施</h3>
<p>第四期第一次配紗，前日（二日）晚開始由第六區棉紡織公會配紗委員會撥定，繕單交與棉紗複製品工業公會配紗委員會，昨日（三日日）並由複配會轉配與染織，針織，內衣，毛巾被毯，手帕及手工棉織等六公會，並先將原有外埠工廠停配之紗，撥定成數，交與駝絨，帆布，織帶三業，另行分配，據複製會消息，此次配紗，共計各支五一八一件，照其改定之折合率計算，合二十支標準六一六〇·二六件，但其細支折合率大見提高，若以原定之折合率計算，較之上决，的减少六百件左右，且其中十支粗紗仍有七百餘件，故分配時倍覺困難，各工廠實配之紗不過四成左右，至四十二支雙股漲價之說，經複配會負責人詢諸紡管會業務處負責人，據稱尙在核辦中，此决應仍照原價辦理，複配會已函請棉紡業査照，大約漲價當自下次實行也，今日（四日）下午三時，棉紡業公會配紗會召開會議，已函邀複製業及紗號業列席，對於各支折合率，及四十二支漲價事件，將有討論，據某專家談稱，按二十支現行之議價而推算，四十二支雙股有加價至三百十一萬元之可能，其原定議價爲二百七十九萬元，此次棉紡業擬漲至三百四十六萬元云。</p>
<h3>煤斤黑市猖獗　公會籲請取消</h3>
<p>連日本煤觔黑市又見猖獗，市價在騰，現該業公會方面已向當局籲請改善配售，取消統制，准許煤業自由採運，據煤業聯配處方面消息，煤價黑市釀成，其最主要原因，實爲經濟部燃料委員會統制，分配之煤斤數量不敷，蓋自本年八月以來，該會分配之煤觔逐漸增加，八月份爲一萬噸，九月份爲二萬三千噸，十月份爲三萬九千噸，但至十一月份則僅配二萬噸，目下時屆冬令，煤觔消耗數量較多而配煤反見减少，致供求不能平衡，且煤業同業自由採運，更受阻碍，國內產區旣不准採運，國外更遭外匯結匯之限制，因之煤觔來源全賴燃管會供給，每月由秦皇島運到者約十二萬噸，由合灣運到者的七八萬噸，故不敷實際需要甚鉅</p>
<h3>大批麺粉續到</h3>

<h3>吳研因司長來滬洽商　國定本供應問題　七聯處正加強印運機購</h3>
<p>〔本報南京三日電〕敎育部國敎司長吳硏因，偕秘書魏冰心，今乘京滬軍香港，洽商國定本中小學敎科用書供應問題，並將賣成七聯供應處，嚴密取締翻版。</p>
<p>〔另訊〕國定本中小學敎科書開放問題，曾一度宣傳，近已入靜止狀態。記者昨晤出版界某君，據談：國定本敎科用書，明年春季如何印供問題，敎部上月　　的承印之七聯供應處十一家負責人至京交換意見後，曾提出部務會議鄭重討論，決定仍交七聯處照的印供，並取締翻版，以責專成。聞敎部國民敎育司司長吳硏因氏，昨乘直來滬，將向各家磋商趕速印運之具體辦法。據悉，個中原因複雜，緣七聯處　家每期的　　本，爲數共逾二百億元以上，設無版權保障，各家勢必停止印供，屆時一般小型印　　　商，能否負此重任，全國合計，究能印供若干，邊遠省縣又將如何供應在，在在均成問題。書荒情形，年來已大見减少，遠非房荒糧荒等嚴重情形可比，七聯處各家今年秋銷後，各地存書，數達二千萬册以上，所負債息甚巨，如不受軍事及交通稱種影響，則盈　詞　，各地決不至有缺書之慮。國定本須有統制性，譬如國內每年行銷最廣數逾七百萬册之新舊釣，其版本用紙印製及售價等等，亦均有嚴密之管制機構及辦法，決非開放版權，自由印供。國定課本，一部分係直接採用各家課本，由敎部校訂，一部分係局部採用各家髁文圖表，各家並未出讓版權，故來日如採開放版權辦法權在法律上及技術上亦待詳加硏究。其具體解決辦法，日內吳研因司長抵滬後，當可迅速洽定。聞七聯各家前此曾購存巨額紙張，旋因　放版權之　傳甚盛，故遲遲未曾付印。現敎部旣已不變原定政策，各家正在儘量設法，加强印運機構，改用捲筒機趕印，以便早日完成分運各地供應工作云。擁有顯微鏡八百架</p>

<h3>蘇州商會監事長　貪污案內幕　地下錢莊商民透露消息　城防部隊嚴密查明眞相</h3>
<p>— 本報蘇州一日訊　物派記者吳守仁</p>
<p>蘇州一大貪汚案，自本報首先揭發後，蘇州各界人士，莫不寄予密切的注視，雄都想早日知道其中的內幕詳情。</p>
<p>這件案十，牽涉到蘇州士紳范君博，陸紹芬等，他們在上月十六日那一天，給駐蘇的傘兵總隊司令部兼署蘇州城防指揮部傳去訊問了，歷四小時之久，並且同時有經營地下錢莊的陸鐵蓀，王養志，吳炳章三人，連同帳冊也給先後傳訊。茲誌經過詳情如次：</p>
<p>一句怨言　引起激查工作</p>
<p>遠在十一月的上旬，城防指揮部的參謀主任許亞股上校，輾轉聽到了一句怨言，這句怨言是經營地下錢莊的商人所說的，大意是：「地方的軍政機關都拿了我們的賄賂，却仍不讓我們公開營業……」。這一句怨言，在年靑充滿着朝氣的許主任心中，立刻激起了一種愧惶和忿懣的情緒，他遂即週密地檢肅了一下自己的部屬，結果是城防指揮部的幹部，絕對沒有人拿過地下錢莊一個火錢。雖然淸者自淸，濁者自濁，不是外界任何瀾言所可混淆，但前進的軍人愛惜自己的軍譽，比生命還重要。因此，許主任報吿馬司令經許可後，就向多方面展開實地調査工作，所得的情報很一致，都說地下錢莊在本年七月至九月間，曾化過二次用以賄賂軍政機關的錢，據說第一次是七月中旬，數目在五千萬元以上，第二次是九月中旬，（農屑中秋前後），數目的三千萬元左右，並且對是誰經手收集的問題，也獲得了且體的姓名。當時城防部的態度，認爲七月中旬的第一次，傘兵還沒有接防，可以置之不問，但九月中旬的第二次，却是已担任城防工作的時期，不能不澈査出一個究克來。</p>
<p>冒名受賄　地方士紳涉嫌</p>
<p>可是，因爲他們情報中說的經手收集賄款人的姓名，太令人不易置信了。誰能相信一個居於社會領導者地位的士紳，會不去領導社會前進，而去領導非法地下錢莊行賄？何况這筆賄款，（第二次）據化錢的地下錢莊說是專門給城防部的，而事實上城防部確乎沒有收受分文。這裏而顯然還有冒名中飽的嫌疑。馬司令爲了求毋枉毋縱的證實計，運用技巧派了城防部二個工作人員，假意說是城防部需要款子，去訪問了范君博，那裏知道范先生果然一口應承，可以籌集二千萬元，隔天就能繳淸。這一個答覆，無異保證了情報的正確性，馬司令以及他的參謀長徐炎武少將，參謀主任劉農畯上校，和城防部參謀長李宜年上校，，參謀主任許亞殷上校，這幾位傘兵總隊高級的長官，誰都燃燒起正義的火燄，而不能再有所顧忌或姑息了。於是，十六日上午十時許，范君博在不尋常的氣氛之下，傳進了拿兵司令部的參謀長室。</p>
<p>六百萬元　來自地下錢莊</p>
<p>詢問的情形非常客氣，不過在客氣之中，充分流露着嚴肅的情緒。可是，事態的演變實在出乎意料之外，范君博處在徐李兩參謀長，劉許兩參謀主任十分和善的質問之下，竟又透露了第三次向地下錢莊籌款的情形。記者的拙筆也許不能形容出這一種複雜的案情，因此，特節錄他們之間的問答，原詞如下：（問）據報本部官兵有向地下錢莊要錢情事，范先生你知道嗎？（答）沒有聞及，祇因地下錢莊的放款係屬禁止之列，所以保安隊及警察局曾商借六百萬元作做棉制服之費。（問）還有其他嗎？（答）六百萬元是有的，其他是沒有。（問）六百萬元是誰經手籌的，款項現存那裏？（答）是陸鐵蓀，王養志，吳炳章三個地下錢莊商人親自籌交陸紹芬的，我可以證明。（問）棉制服購製委員會經費如何籌集？（答）是向錢莊借的，該六百萬元交款，並未取收據，將來不準備還，故未出收據。（問）購製委員會有沒有聘書？（答）有聘書，並曾開會二次，討論言及籌款做制服，將來以營業稅收入還償。（問）可以將聘書及會議紀錄拿來看嗎？（答）可以的。（問）如何不向銀行借款而向地下錢莊籌款？（答）是地下錢莊志願出款，能歸還最好，否則也就不要了。</p>
<p>傳訊多人　彼此各執一詞</p>
<p>根據范君博的應答，馬司令與許參謀長等意見，是暫時把九月中旬的三千萬元擱置不談，先澈査這六百萬元所謂商借的制服費問題。由於范君博說是可以證明六百萬元由陸鐵蓀等親自籌交陸紹芬的緣故，所以立刻又傳陸鐵蓀，王義志，吳炳章質訊，綜合他們的供詞，可以歸納數點：（一）六百萬元制服縫工費，交給范君博，係借貸性質，由二三十家地下錢莊，每家廿五萬元拚凑起來的。（二）錢是在十月下旬交割的。（三）囚范是商會監事長，所以相信他，沒有取借據，不過並未以傘兵總隊名義籌集。（四）在六百萬元籌款繳淸不久，陸紹芬曾以私人名義寄存二百萬元於吳炳章之錢莊內。案情發展到這樣程度，陸紹芬是勢必一定要出塲的了。記者在此，也就以問答原詞節錄如下：（問）最近十月內范君博向地下錢莊索款，是給你分配的嗎？（答）范是制服製委會委員，由他經借到縫工費六百萬元，要交我保管，我並非委員所以沒有接受。（問）錢在那裏呢？（答）當時仍在范君博處，第二天又要我保管，我仍拒絕，所以由范招原經籌人寄存給他們，聲明付繼工費時支付之。（問）他們說錢在你處？（答）他們避重就輕，可以常面質詢。</p>

<h3>「制服費」的質詢　進展到了最高潮</h3>
<p>上面摘錄的三方面供詞，彼此各執一詞，究竟誰是誰非，很不容易判斷；誠如陸紹芬所說可以當面對質。事實上也不得不如此，詢問工作就此進展到最高潮了。記者仍以問答方式簡誌他們的對質詞如下：（問）陸鐵蓀：籌款交給誰的？（答）交范先生的，我不在塲。（問）范君博：你聽見嗎？（答）請陸先生保管的。（問）陸紹芬：錢在那裏呢？（答）我沒有拿，後分交陸鐵蓀，王養志，吳炳章各二百萬元。（問）陸鐵蓀：有二百萬元在你處嗎？（答）有二百萬元在我處，僅係寄存，我也不知爲何款。他們交給我，因爲風險大。（問）范君博：制服做了沒有？（答）剛開始做。（問）范君博：你向那幾方面募款？（答）僅向地下錢莊，他們是捐獻的。（問）陸鐵蓀：爲什麼收付款項，不按正規手續？（答）實因情感關係。（問）陸紹芬：你們收付款項，不按手續，可見不光明。（答）不過民情如此！（問）范君博：你以什麼來償還呢？（答）以營業稅收入償還。</p>
<p>縣長聲明　購製棉衣實情</p>
<p>訊間到如此階段，差不多什麽都很瞭然的了。但因爲范君博口口聲聲說籌集這筆款項，有棉制服購製委員會的會議記錄可證，並且準備以營業稅收入償還，似乎縣政府也不能脫身事外。所以，十六日的那天，馬司令決定各關係人均飭回，而請范君博提供會議記錄後再商辦法。可是，延至十九日會議記錄還沒有提供出來，遂由徐參謀長邀請縣長逯劍華，正式査詢吳縣保警棉衣購製委會，究竟有沒有授權范君博，去經募縫工費的問題，逯氏非常鄭重地聲明，本年度保警棉衣費共一億零八百萬元，早經列人縣預算，但因呈省動支，公文往返時，而保警人員需要棉衣禦寒，已經刻不容緩，所以邀集地方法團士紳，組織購製委負會，其工作純在辦理招標開標事宜，以求公允，並無籌募部份。况且，該項棉制服自開標決定由李震記西服號承製後，合同訂明先付六成縣府已撥付現鈔三千五百萬元，並付襯布折價二千數百萬元，已履行合同所訂契的，絕無另籌縫工費的必要。途氏並堅決否認曾預知范君博此項舉動。</p>
<p>保衛地方　不望絲毫酬報</p>
<p>逯縣長的聲明是値得我們注意的，至少他確定了本案的性質，是貧汚抑或是舞弊。記者曾就本案的處置問題，詢諸馬師恭少將，據馬氏很感喟地說：「百年樹人，一個人在社會上的聲望，決非朝夕所可倖致，我們澈査此案的本意，一則是因外界有城防部得賄的謠傳，一則是基於勸人爲善的意思。因此，祗要本部軍譽保持，以及今後知所烱戒，我們也就不準備太予人難堪。總之，我們奉令駐防蘇州，保衛地方，是我們應盡的責任，決不要絲毫酬報，也決不動用地方一分一厘的血汗！」</p>
<p>但據關係方面的消息，這六百萬元的攤募款，實在並非駐軍當局所需要偵查的對象，他們所急求水落石出的，是九月中旬純粹借駐軍名義，而募集三千萬元賄款的事件。所以，今後再有沒有演變，迄至記者截稿時，還絕不能說就此中止調査。不過，縱然不再逍究下去，也足給若干不知檢點的人，一種極嚴正的惕勵。傘兵總隊此舉，對蘇州每况愈下的社會風氣，確乎是一服急救的針劑！我們遙望靑年的朝氣正蓬勃生長，而與朽腐的黑暗勢力，展開了新的接觸，我們應該如何促進這種光明氣象的揭開呵！</p>
<h3>滇西在苦難中</h3>
<p>— 十一月廿三日航訊　本報昆明特派員徐繼濂</p>
<p>滇西—這一個僅有七十六萬一千多人，可是面積却佔有了四萬二千一百二十平方公里的廣大區域，要不是報章上常常出現一點災情嚴重的消息，恐怕早就會被人們所遺忘了的。</p>
<p>當然，像如此一個山脈縱橫，地勢坎坷，旣無河流，又無鐵道的偏僻地帶，說起來可資運轍的便只有三百四十七公里的公路，而馱馬道却有了五千七百三十餘公里的長度，如果平均以日行三十公里計算，則繞行一週需時一百九十一天，再說，瘴氣區佔有了滇西面積百分之五十八以上，因之，人多視爲畏途，要開墾這一片土地，實在需要最大的決心和毅力。</p>
<p>說起來，雲南被敵人蹂躪最兇的便是龍陵騰衝兩縣，然而不幸的是使整個滇西蒙受了最大的災難，以此人口的死亡在繼續着，而最嚴重的是在災區生存困難，以此僤人系藏緬系各民族乃聚向國界外逃亡，或者接受界外的救濟，如果根據國防觀點來說，若不迅予綏撫，以則其後果是不能加諸想像的。</p>
<p>民族複雜　方言各別</p>
<p>說起滇西民族的複雜，這也是一個特殊的現象，如果列舉出來，則據調査所知：計有漢族，漢擺夷，水擺夷，大小蒲蠻，阿昌，民家，怒子，　　，卡瓦，山頭，土俚，茶山，漢傈傈，黑傈僳，老亢，倮黑，浪速，　拉，花傈傈，倮倮，達廿一種之多，而且方言各別，到這一個區域的人，若使不打算留下三年五載，則很難得對他們獲有一點較爲明晣的概念。</p>
<p>這裏，我們想使外界人士稍稍明瞭一點滇西的災情，首先人口的損失戰後便較戰前減少了百分之二十六强，金錢損失數字的總額約達五百億元，更不凑巧的是本年七月間所發生的水災，一直泛濫到龍江·盈江·東河·施甸河·大壩河沿岸區域，打開地圖一看，　積已達二十萬畝，跟着水災而來的便是飢荒了，推究原因：滇西平時食糧即有匱乏之虞，騰衝龍陵自敵人魔掌下解放出來，歉收之象已成，田地荒蕪日多，再加之壯丁缺乏，人力不足，牲畜死亡，獸力不足，而種籽肥料在在均感恐慌，以此災情之嚴重自不難想見。</p>
<p>代糧索價　疾病相連</p>
<p>在旁的地方鬧災荒的時候，我們常聽到以樹皮草根代糧充飢，想想：樹皮草根總該是隨處可以掇拾，然而在滇西災區裏連「代糧」也有了問題，不信麽？樹根草根每　紫價達兩千元，這又豈是二十世紀內所能加諸想像的事？</p>
<p>談到疾病的侵書，滇西所受到的脅迫更大了，全境有百分之五十八以上都在瘧疾區裏，怒江流城南定河谷盈江下游一帶的瘧蚊，只要是去過滇西的人，想必都會「談蚊色變」的。而一年一度的鼠疫更在折磨着人，這一個「地方病」的潛伏力量够大，更加上回歸熱流行區域廣大，死亡率又高·在保山·騰衝·龍陵·梁河·　水一帶的居民，都稱回歸熱爲「鷄窩病」，因爲侮有死亡則必一窩之故，他如傷寒霍亂痢疾流行性感冒等等多不時侵襲，更爲使得滇西人口不能增多的次要原因。</p>
<p>雨量過多　穿吃都難</p>
<p>論氣候，到過是明的人都有不盡的留戀，然而滇西怎樣呢？「四季無寒暑，一雨便成冬」，雨季的壓迫更是非常沉重的，滇西的雨量太多，再加之分佈又極不均匀，雨季可以綿亙達五月之久，根本無法種棉，以此便影響及於衣着的恐慌，長期風雨的侵襲，使得住的問題轉趨嚴重，收復已達二年，但是論建築的恢復還不到千分之一，流離失所的人羣正在徬徨無依，可是問題不是一直存在着麽？</p>
<h3>寗死一人　不死一牛</h3>
<p>山地裏的民族是與牲畜們最親近的，他們的衣食住行生活問題，幾乎沒有一刻能够離開牲畜而索居，在滇西，表現得更爲厲害，無牛不能耕，無馬不能行，在災區裏盛行着「寗死一人，不死一牛」的諺語，因爲災區裏現在需要耕牛五萬頭，如果我們很粗率地計算一下，死一頭牛將要平均荒田十五畝，而每畝田平均產米的四百五十斤，（十五畝產米共有六千七百五十斤）而每人每日平均需要糧米二十斤，如此推算一下，一頭牛死亡的後果是四千五百人都要生活在飢餓綫上。</p>
<p>救濟工作　推行不易</p>
<p>情形是十分嚴重的，災區的苦難情景由於上邊的描述，該有了一個粗率的槪念，然而救濟工作怎樣呢？說來實在貧乏之至，行政院善後救濟總署滇西辦事處今年春天成立，直到四月間才正式開始工作，工作的熱情固然很高，只是環境以及物資的限制，使得他們無法順利開始，處長徐頌九在滇西呆過很久，地方情形非常熟悉，記者三月前在保山會着他，他搖搖頭，說滇西較兩年前收復時更爲凋敝，救濟已是刻不容緩，可是巧婦難爲無米之炊，滇西人士口口聲聲說：不發聯總物資，便算不得救濟，然而要獲得物資，便是行總的也是難，難！由一連串的難字裏，我們也正想像得到主其事者的苦衷！聽說在龍陵展開救濟工作時，曾發生縣參議長等四十二人聯名拒絕聯總物資以外的救濟，並阻撓調査工作的情事，這樣，更使得他們有點氣沮，徐頌九處長於是飛到京滬去請示了，聽說情形還相當圓滿，救濟物資可以空運來滇，在昆市的省參議會上，也曾有若干參議員建議將滇西辦事處擴大爲雲南分署，中樞的答覆如何還沒有下文，新署長霍寳澍先生上任許久，也許可能會有點新希望吧！</p>
<p>問題總是不能讓其永遠存在的，總之滇西在受難中，這一個較台灣還要廣大六千二百八十六平方公里的區域內，正生活着七十多萬人口，他們在和疾病抗戰，在飢餓錢上掙扎，期望的，需要的，只是最實際的救濟！</p>
<h3>昆明大火災！　五華山光復樓焚燬記</h3>
<p>— 昆明廿五日航訊　特派員余繼濂</p>
<p>十一月廿四日下午兩點鐘，昆市發生了幾年來未有的大火警，被焚的地方是滇中人士所最矚目的五華山上光復樓，民國以來雲南省府的駐節地，平西王吳三桂的王宮。遠在二十八年以前，這裏曾經建立了擁護共和軍的軍政府，唐繼堯都督在這裏發號施令，粉碎了袁世凱的帝制迷夢。在這山頂上的公邸，正有着光復河山的輝煌歷史意義，因之，這便成爲「光復樓」定名的來源。</p>
<p>刷地板用汽油　不小心着了火</p>
<p>起火原因是非常凑巧的：禮拜天的下午，省府裏的一位科員領着四名工友在主席辦公廳的地板上重新「打蠟」，爲了使得地板光滑澤潤，黃蠟拌合了汽油，加溫烤熱，一不當心，汽油遇着了火，於是冒烟了，祝融帝驀然下凡，工友一慌，扯動地　想撲滅火種，却弄巧反拙，把屋角裏一桶剩餘的汽油一起潑倒，一時「火上加油」再仗着風勢，這一座歷史上有價値有名望的大樓，便被火舌所捲走了。</p>
<p>到過雲南的人，沒有不響往於這座巍然山顚大樓的神秘性的，說也確實，滇中人士對於五華山的尊崇，與故都人士對於明故宮的看法也就沒有兩樣；它成爲一千七百萬雲南人民所最熟悉的「名稱」，一座可望而不可即矗立於叢林包裹着的山頭，一齊排列兩層樓的大辦公廳，中間一座相連的三層高樓，上面題有斗大泥金的王趙字，這正是歷來雲南省長公署，督軍府，省政府，委員長行營，綏靖公署的駐節所在地呢。</p>
<p>四面羣山拱手　向晚全城燃燈</p>
<p>傍晚，昆明八景之一的「五華　繞」在這山頭展現了，你可以從這裏俯瞰整個昆明的湖光山色，像昆湖，像翠海，還有有名的臥佛山和陲山一齊收來眼底，會使你興起對羅馬凱撒大帝的遐思，以此許多滇中的老前輩都說：五華山的地脈好，不信麽？請看「四面羣山拱手，向晚全城燃燈」。</p>
<p>正因爲五華山是雲南全省最高的權力機關所在地，是人民的禍福所自來，因之門禁森嚴不可或入，一般人對它都存了崇敬和恐懼之心，老百姓有一輩子沒有「上過山」的，於是光復樓便成爲了崇敬，恐懼，神秘，疑惑編熾成的對象，作爲一個市民只能從老遠的低地，翹首仰望着那一排整齊頳紅色的樓房。滇中故老吿訴我：承華圃過去的講武堂，現在的中央軍官學校五分，校的大門是面對着光復樓的。有人便這樣銓釋：軍校學生出了大門，一眼便看見了五華山，不由自主地會興起了一層幻覺，「我也該到上面去坐兩天」。這一說不打緊，當局以後便把軍分校大門另闢在洪化橋，不讓它再緊對五華山了。</p>
<p>客廳佈置考究　鬼的傳說紛紜</p>
<p>光復樓裏的佈置是够考究的，下層是一個華麗的大客廳，四週圍繞着白漆鏤花鑲金的高牆，懸着張作霖大師贈送精美的吊燈，天鵝絨的大地氈，名貴的油畫，古雅的紫檀木椅，屛風樣的大鏡子……都成爲了這樓中美麗精緻的點綴。各辦公廳裏似乎有點陰暗空闊之感，因爲每間房裏還鑲着淸代的石碑，外邊一列長的走廊和甬道，於是，很多關於鬼的傳說被駐紮在山上的警衛們談論着</p>
<p>抗戰八年多，雲南挨過不少次的大轟炸，然而五華山上的光復樓依舊錢然屹立，人們更把它視作神奇的象徴了。今年二月間，雲南省府改組，五華山在重重包圍下，也不會受到絲毫損傷，雖然「樓主易人」，但光復樓的輝煌史跡仍然放射着光芒，哪曾想到一塲大便吞沒了這座有歷史意義的建築物？</p>
<p>埃及王金　殿　祝融帝借用了</p>
<p>火綱映紅了半邊天，一直到夜四處還　着烟頭，救火的雖然奮勇，可是終於無法戰勝天力，廿五日一早記者趕到了火塲，餘燼未熄，這所過去召開省府會議，招待數百外賓的會議廳和客廳，已經是荒土一片，瓦礫一堆，只能臨風作一次最後的悵望和憑弔了。</p>
<p>文件和卷宗大部都搶救了出來，這總算是不幸中的萬幸，很久前計劃着的合署辦公，這一來便被强迫地實行了。幾個肇禍者在押，負責人引咎請罪光復樓從此便只是歷史上的名詞，我還記得英國名記者約翰根室在他的「亞洲內幕」中曾經描寫光復樓的客廳說。「這鑲了金的客廳，其富豐堂皇，有如古埃及王的金　寳殿。」離開火塲時，我的腦子裏幻覺着一座巍峨宮殿的影子！</p>

<h3>獨裁在南斯拉夫</h3>
<p>— 張逸人摘譯自讀者文摘</p>
<p>作者B.it　a爲南政府高級官員，娶意大利名歷史學家勿拉　之　　　，　在紐約從事新聞事業。</p>
<p>世界上共產黨員都在企求「民主」。蘇聯以外其他各處他　躍躍欲試都想加入「國民陣綫」「人民陣綫」「進步人民委員會」及其他類加的組織，以期促進「民主」。我居留本國很久，對於此事稍有經騐，洞悉這種狡猾巧妙的「戰略」，現在不妨記述一二，以供參考。</p>
<p>獨裁政治</p>
<p>一九四五年南政府任我爲蒂托元帥宣傳　國外情報組主任。蒂托政府自稱爲「人民陣綫」，國內各民族一律平等，不分黨派政見。於是政府中共黨亦有立足之地了。共黨始終贊成「管理」而非「合作」，因此國內各「權力分子」都被吸收完盡，其結果於「民主」適相反；言論出版，思想都都無自由可言，人民思想均被「政治警察」所支配。逮捕，監禁，死刑，殘殺等隨時都有發生的可能。南政府簡直是一個恐怖的獨裁政治！</p>
<p>共黨稱一般「民主」的信仰者爲「有用的愚人」，我也是其中之一。一九四三年我在紐約任南政府情報組長。我自一九二八年起即任職於南斯拉夫政府。戰前的南政府缺乏民主的思想。蒂托曾召開第一次全國解放會議，所以我疑想蒂托的政府或許是民主政治的開端。</p>
<p>當然我以爲民主的聯邦政府必彼得大帝的帝國政府來得好，所以我贊成蒂托，時常在美國的紙章上發表文章。我有一篇文章曾在國家雜誌上發表說：「新那斯拉夫正在成長中，我喜蒂托政府，因爲我們新生國家的希望全部寄托在這個政府上。」</p>
<p>秘密警察</p>
<p>因此我於一九四〇年十一月自紐約乘船回國，我的全家均至碼頭歡送。那時我夢想她們在不久的將來能和我在自由的南斯拉夫領土內生活着。當我抵達巴爾格萊特時，自由之花到處都是—蘇聯人所給與的自由。滿街都是蘇兵，櫥窗中望去都是史太林元帥的照片，所以我對於蘇聯軍人的搶我手錶毫不介意「給我這錶」是蘇軍對南國市民的習用語。錶類對於這批「解放者」顯然含有特殊的興趣。的確他們是「解放者」，是我們斯拉夫民族的一分子。</p>
<p>戰前的統治階級現在已變成衣衫襤褸的游民。自從我任職宣傳部以來，我即被秘密共產黨員暗中監視着，因爲我在一九四〇年曾寫一書名「歐洲之苦悶」，他們認爲這書過於偏重民主思想。那時的宣傳部長是Save　Kosa　nvich，現任駐華盛頓大使。因爲他不是共產黨員，所以部內實務由他的幫辦某共產黨員支配，外交部長Ivan　Subasich亦非黨員，所以他的大權握在一共黨人員手中。</p>
<p>當初共黨曾揚言「白宮」改爲兒童與工人們的宿舍，然而現在事實適相反——白宮現成爲蒂托元帥的住宅，富麗冠全國。</p>
<p>死氣沉沉</p>
<p>蒂托喜笑，頗能行事，穿衣很像哥林，作風類如墨索里尼。正像法西斯主義共產主義亦需要一種活潑的「象徵」；當他檢閱工人，公務人員和學齡兒童的隊伍時，蒂托含笑爲禮，聽那自隊伍中發出的歡呼聲：「蒂托是我們的；我們是蒂托的。蒂托！蒂托！」那時的蒂托好像是人間的上帝。每次蒂托的演說詞完全是財長（一工黨黨員）及史太林一知友所作。</p>
<p>爲了統治一千四百萬的南斯拉夫人民，南政府設立一秘密警察結構，名「民防部」，雇用十萬名「間諜」，此外尚有類如希特勒第五縱隊的組織，他們的衣食住爲全國人民最豐富的。</p>
<p>我曾作三哩的國內旅行，發見到處都是死沉沉的一片，在我的故鄉，一年老婦人曾問我：「你何爲而來？這裏只有死者是快樂的。」更有一農民對我說：「共黨人員來了，我們是自由了。他們把我們的六十名孩子帶去，現在音訊杳然。從前我們可以在一起跳舞，現在沒有人來同我們跳了。除了工作以外，我們只得悶坐在家中。這就所謂我們的自由！」</p>
<p>很明顯的，蒂托政府的行動全被蘇聯政府所控制。南國所處的地位可以說是附庸的地位。而蘇政府的政策欲使南國與合衆國進入對立狀態中。</p>
<p>總之蘇聯的政策用意欲在使六個南斯拉夫民族併入保加利亞及亞爾巴尼亞，成爲「巴爾幹聯邦」，然後再把這聯邦併入蘇維埃聯邦，成爲蘇聯的一共和國。這樣蘇俄可直穿黑海，到達亞得　亞海，經過亞爾巴尼亞，再入地中海。蘇聯的這種企圖爲帝俄以來所未有，真是駭然聽聞的呀！</p>
<p>時事評述</p>
<h3>成功湖的波蘭</h3>
<p>— 儲玉坤</p>
<p>從調查國外駐軍到裁軍</p>
<p>戰後世界的形勢，一直在明晦不定的階段；到了最近，更陷於冬眠狀態。僅見成功湖的波蘭迭起，聯合國大會內唇槍舌戰，這一星期來，辯論的焦點，從調查國外駐軍論起，辯到裁減軍備問題，這兩個問題，雖然都是蘇聯代表提出的，而且莫洛托夫也想以此爲進攻英美的工具，但是辯論的結果，蘇聯一再遭受挫拆，聯合國大會所通過的，都是英美代表提出的修正案。</p>
<p>國內國外　同時調查</p>
<p>聯合國安全理事會於十一月廿六日開會討論調查各國國外駐軍一項問題時蘇聯外長莫洛托夫提出一項拆衷方案主張二點（一）聯合國各會員國，應依照　國代表所提出之修正案，在一九四七年一月一日以前，將其駐在聯合國其他會員國或以前敵國境內之軍事實力，提供一切準確之情報；（二）暫緩討論聯合國各國國內所保有之軍隊問題，俟至討論普遍裁減軍備問題時，一併予以討論。</p>
<p>但是英國代表埃爾貝克與美國代表康奈萊對於蘇聯的拆衷方案，仍表示異議。辯論終結，聯合國政治及安全委員會乃以四十票對十票的多數將英國的建議予以通過。按之英國建議，主張聯合國各會員國駐在國外之軍隊及其國內所有之軍隊，應同時予以調查。但對於蘇聯代表所提出調查各國軍備的建議，則拒不加以討論。</p>
<p>裁軍問題　再度提出</p>
<p>聯合國大會於廿八日又討論裁減軍備問題，原提案人蘇聯外長莫洛托夫又發表意見，力言「普遍裁減軍隊，對於所有國家，不間其爲大國或小國，均有莫大裨益。人類的希望，即繫於此」，接着法國代表巴洛迪繼起發言，表示擁護蘇聯的建議。至於蘇聯建議的內容要點有四：（一）聯合國大會爲世界和平計，應承認各國普遍裁減軍隊之一項原則；（二）應禁止以原子能用於軍事上之目的；（三）聯合國大會應向安全理事會提議，確保此等原則付諸實施；（四）聯合國大會應籲請各會員國，以一切必要之援助，　予安全理事會。</p>
<p>但是澳洲代表對此，提出一項修正案，據共代表梅金談稱，（一）裁減軍備問題，應與安全問題，同時解決；（二）防止將來簽訂之協定使現行公約成爲無效；（三）裁減軍備之機構，應顧及聯合國最高參謀會議所進行之工作；（四）各國一律平等之原則，必須確切予以規定，並須作爲討論之基礎。同時美國代表康奈萊也發表意見，　明　國對於裁減軍備問題的態度。實言之，（一）裁減軍備與集體安全二事，應同時並進，（二）聯合國大會應採確切之措施，俾使裁軍能普遍而且能有效；（三）原子能必須由聯合國機構負責加以管制；（四）吾人　特必須計及各國所有現役軍隊，抑且亦應計及其隨時可動員之軍隊。</p>
<p>中國態度　綜合意見</p>
<p>至於中國對於這個問題的態度如何？曾由顧維鈞博士加以說明：他說：「蘇澳加三國所提出之建議，經本人加以縝密研究之後，認爲蘇聯之計劃，最爲簡單，甚至過於簡單，有加以修正及補充之必要。故加拿大所提出之修正案，最爲有用，澳洲之修正案，亦復相同，綜合言之，可歸納成四項具體辦法：（一）依照聯合國憲章第四十三條之規定，組織國際軍隊；（二）原子能委員會雖須依照現行規則程序繼續工作，但應禁止所有原子武器以及其他大規模破壞之武器；（三）依照加澳兩國修正案所揭　之原則，設立國際管制機構及監察制度；（四）所有各國均應支持安全理事會及原子能委員會，畀予援助，務使其工作得以順利進行。</p>
<p>各國對於裁軍問題的意見太紛歧了，在聯大討論不出一個結論來，因此只好擱置，暫不討論了。</p>
<h3>蘇聯的海軍　較諸英美　仍見渺小</h3>
<p>— 〔岱山譯路透社資料〕</p>
<p>雖然蘇聯最近已在建造十六吋口徑巨砲戰鬥艦，及正在建造或已建成二萬二千噸航空母艦，但根據現有情報，已足證明自從德國戰敗後，蘇聯在開始建設強大紅艦隊途徑上，仍極少進步。</p>
<p>最新版之吉奈氏戰鬥艦刊物說：蘇聯海軍工程師已在建造裝有九門十六吋居砲，取名Trille　International的戰鬥艦，其龍骨已於一九三九年在列甯格勒港塢　下，同時，另一同級巨艦，可能在該波羅的海同一港口內建造中。</p>
<p>裝有二十二架飛機的航空母艦Krasnaya　Znamya號可能在最近完成或已在去年下水。吉奈氏報告中並未提及去年關於蘇聯開始新造船艦之情報，因此可以決定蘇聯艦隊，比之英美海軍，仍爲無可比較之少數。在二次大戰後一九四六年，英美海軍官及工作人員爲四九二，八〇〇名及五五〇，〇〇〇名，吉奈氏報告紅艦隊工作人員共有二三，六〇〇名。</p>
<p>根據吉奈氏報告，蘇聯現時最大海軍重砲爲十二吋徑來復砲膛及七一四磅的砲彈，目前美國則有五種重型海軍主力砲，其中兩種爲十六吋口徑，可以發射二一〇〇磅重的砲彈。英國有四種重砲，包括一種十六吋來復砲膛，發射二四六一磅重的砲彈，吉奈氏相信蘇聯僅有四艘老式戰鬥艦及十只巡洋艦包括德國紐恩堡號在內，而該艦係波茨坦會議決定由蘇聯接管者。蘇聯在戰時曾獲得美國巡洋艦現改名爲茂明斯克及其他英美較小之船艦。蘇聯曾獲得七艘德國巡洋艦及七艘較小之納粹船隻，此外還有十艘潛水艇及二艘掃冰艦。</p>
<p>吉奈氏相信蘇聯已經掠奪偽滿巡洋艦一隻及砲艦數只。此外，吉奈氏又信蘇聯已有潛水艇在一〇〇隻以上。</p>
<p>從蘇聯艦隊之現狀而論，在與英美比較之下，　見極端渺小</p>

<h3>康納利　美外交政策　決策人之一</h3>
<p>— 郁強譯</p>
<p>誰是美國外交政策的決定人？杜魯門總統嗎？不！讀者們祗要回味一下華萊士事件發生時，他先後發表聲明的情况，就明瞭在他的背後，隱然還有一個巨大的力量在操縱着。貝爾納斯國務卿嗎？也不是，他和杜魯門一樣，僅不過是個執行人而已。那麼誰在幕後發號施令呢？——是美國參衆兩院的外交委員會。說得更具體些，是這兩個委員會的主席：康納利和范登堡。</p>
<p>這裏來談談康納利。</p>
<p>湯姆·康納利（Tom　Conally）一八七七年誕生於德克撤州的麥克蘭南縣，是個鄉下孩子。他從小口才就很好，當地替他想了個「會說話的湯姆」的綽號，又因爲他的雙腿很瘦弱，便又得了個綽號：「雙銃短槍」。他的父親常常對他說：「假如我有你這種教育程度，我早就進國會了」。</p>
<p>所以康納利在年青的時候便立志做名議員。而他終於達到了目的，在一九一六年踏入了國會的大門。當康納利競選時，他的對手裝做一個簡樸的人，乘了一輛引人注目的破爛的車子在選區內作競選演說。康納利想弄一部更破爛的車以示對抗，但是無法覓到。於是他靈機一動放棄原來的計劃，買了一輛紅輪子的漂亮的大汽車。他對選民們說：「假如我的對手連替他自己買一輛像樣的汽車的能力都沒有，他是沒有能力在國會中代表你們的」。選民們同意他的話，於是他當選了。</p>
<p>從那時起，康納利便一直在華盛頓度着議員生涯。一九二八年他被選爲參議員，一直聯蟬到現在。康納利雖然在華府做了三十年的「寓公」，可是一開口還是道地的德克撤州美國話，充滿不合文法的土語。他的家庭也　漫着濃重的家鄉味，他和他的太太因他們的星期日早餐的臘腸，淡紅色的朱　，　桃和燻腿而炙膾人口。——所有這些東西都是從德克撤州帶來的。</p>
<p>康納利有「德克撤州的和平製造者」之稱。第一次世界大戰結束之後，他竭力支持國際聯盟和世界法庭。當參議員奈　　備威爾遜總統欺騙國家陷入戰渦的時候，第一個向奈義挑戰的就是康納利。在這次世界大戰中，他爲了擊潰法西斯主義，獲取永久的和平，便在參議院中領導通過廢止中立法案，並通過租界法案——他是外交委員會的主席，領導參議員通過爭取和平的條約與協定是他的責任。</p>
<p>因爲這些，康納利所說的話是有份量的。他的會客室的走廊中，常是塞滿了人，他們都是來聆取他的見解的。康納利非獨口才好，並且擅於摩擬，手勢很多，絲毫沒有擺架子的神氣。他今年快七十歲了，白髮蕭蕭，銀絲披在腦後幾乎及領，加上他的僵硬的白襯衫，故意不留心的黑領結和一襲長的黑外套，使他的外貌很像舊時代扮演莎士比亞劇中人的演員。</p>
<p>現在，康納利第二次爲和平而努力。國際聯盟失敗了，聯合國呢？他興奮的參加過舊金山會議，前個月又不辭跋涉的參加巴黎和會。但是世界和平的希望愈來愈暗淡了。最近，在聯合國政治委員會會議席上，爲了報告駐軍基地和軍事設備的問題，康納利和莫洛托夫辯得面紅耳赤，這位久經挫折的古稀老人該不會因此而放棄世界和平的信心吧？</p>

<h3>熟悉的脚步</h3>
<p>— 鄭牧之</p>
<p>『在理想的旁邊，還有物質生活着呢』！——小仲馬</p>
<p>有一天，我去出席一個很平常的宴會，然而我喝得很多的酒，醉了，醉得多麼可怕呀！</p>
<p>我摸索着街牆踉蹌地走回去，我倒在床上，還想閉着眼休息一會，但是我的臉部已給酒膨脹得發痛，喉嚨里也幹得難受，當時我也並不考慮，呌僕人打一盆冷水，用來解渴和洗臉。然後使剛才的瘋狂痊癒了大半；我啣着一支紙烟，在沙發上又沉默的坐下。</p>
<p>這時我已不想睡了。夜的情緒像一個美麗而怕羞的少女，月光已從糊有防空紙條約玻璃窗外漏進來偷看我這個患有歇斯的里病底年青人，而我却仍安靜地噴着濃厚的烟圈……。這時突然窗外起了一陣咭咯咭咯的脚步聲，時間已經是十二點左右了；我側着頭靜聽，那個聲音很熟悉，我輕輕地打開窗，我是住在樓上，使我不得不聳起了雙肩向下探索；有一個黑影佔據了一個距這裡不滿尺遠的電桿木的左側，把頭望着右面，他已停止了脚步，那樣憂鬱的守護着。</p>
<p>我想起了我的友人X，於是我高興地吹起尖亮的口哨，口哨幽揚地通過了全街，而他仍舊沒有一點動情。</p>
<p>『誰啊』？</p>
<p>我是沒有說出來。</p>
<p>有許久許久，他依舊沒有動，連捲烟也不想抽。我開始有點恐懼了。</p>
<p>『然而，不會是鬼罷』？</p>
<p>我想着，突然給一種恐懼所脅迫，很快的放棄了窗口，奔到床上，擯息了呼吸，全身祗在抖動。</p>
<p>『也許是是鬼』！</p>
<p>我肯定的想了；但是，後來我也終糊裏糊塗的睡着了。</p>
<p>第二天一早醒來，我記着昨夜的事，伏在窗櫺上探索，但是我失望了，電綫木邊連什麼遺留的東西也沒有，很挺秀的直立着。我疑心可能是夢，也許自己醉了的緣故。</p>
<p>但是當天的晚上十一時左右，我從夢中醒來，又聽見了這個熟悉的脚步聲，他徘徊在人行道上，在寂靜的夜裏，他那種焦急的脚步，顯出了十分的恐怕。</p>
<p>我伏在窗櫺上看着。</p>
<p>他是永不疲乏，也永不發一言，有時往來徘徊，有時倚立電桿木旁，像個幽靈一樣，我知道他不會來傷害我，我不怕，直到我有些支持不來的時候，我回到床上去躺，他仍舊一點不疲倦的在那踱走。他究竟什麼時候回家，我也無從知道。</p>
<p>而此後有一個星期，他每夜來徘徊。</p>
<p>記得是一個星期X的晚上，天下着細濛濛的雨，時間已經是十一時半了，我想他今夜一定怕雨，或者另外的原因而不會再來了，但是當我伏在桌上給遠行人寫信的時候，那熟悉的脚步聲又起了，是它，是一個已經徘徊了一連有一個星期的熟悉的黑影，他沒有披雨衣，僅在頭上覆着一只巴拿馬式的舊帽，顯然他有些懊惱而傷氣了，但是依舊又踱過我的窗下。</p>
<p>細雨一直到十二點多沒有停過，而且愈下愈大了，我真爲他急起來，他却在一家屋簷下稍稍的立了一會，似乎在擠去身上和帽子的水後，又滿不在乎此的又踱走了。</p>
<p>雨降得愈大了，我已把窗關上，看樣子他該走回去，不要說是人，就是鬼也該回到墳墓裏去休息，然而他竟沒有走，在一家屋簷下躱避着。</p>
<p>梅雨季節的六月，空氣濕濕的直沒有停止的希望。</p>
<p>當我重再打開窗來時，他已淋得不堪設想了。</p>
<p>『喂』！</p>
<p>我帶着很懊悔的喊了出來，假使他真是一個鬼。</p>
<p>但是他却用非常驚異的目光仰起頭來。</p>
<p>許久許久，我終又說了：</p>
<p>『雨下得很大，進來坐一會好嗎？』</p>
<p>『……』他躊躇了一會，『但是……也好！』</p>
<p>我走下樓去開了門，讓那個一團淋濕了的黑影躡進來，我們遂在一盞淡黃的電燈光下坐下，這時我開始看清了他的臉，是一張皙白的臉，高聳的鼻樑深邃的眼，發着炯炯的光，眉捷長而濃黑，是一個美麗臉龐的青年，但是爲什麼他要繼續到這裏來徘徊呢？難道他不怕戒嚴之夜的厲害。</p>
<p>我抖顫着手指有點恐懼了。</p>
<p>不過我立用遞給他一支捲烟而掩飾去。</p>
<p>『會吸烟嗎？』</p>
<p>『謝謝你。』</p>
<p>他微微的點點頭，接受我的捲烟。</p>
<p>我同時也燃了一支，濃黑的烟圈，從他的嘴裏吐出來，停留在我的眼前，我摸摸沙發的拷手和自己的頭髮，大槪不會是夢吧！我這樣的做着，引起他笑了，笑得非常猙獰啊！真像一個鬼嘲笑一個垂死的病人，但是我也裝起笑來。</p>
<p>又是許久許久的沉默，我祗是苦苦的抽着烟。他沉靜的注意着窗外的雨，然而窗外除了雨聲，什麼也沒有，連狗也躱了起來。</p>
<p>『你每晚來的？』</p>
<p>我先打破了這可怕的沉寂。</p>
<p>『每晚？』他驚奇地望着我，『每晚來的。』</p>
<p>『大槪你是很愛這裏的月夜？』</p>
<p>『……』他勉强的點點頭。</p>
<p>『但是今天却着很大雨呢！』</p>
<p>這時窗外似乎有人在走路，他急速的從沙發上跳起來，打開窗子伏在窗櫺上吹口哨，他吹的口哨多麼使人悅耳，一節，二節，三節，街上的行人去遠了，他重復回到沙發上，蒼白的臉上好像被擊了一記耳光，見了我微微地泛出一點紅暈。</p>
<p>『你到窗上去，……但是爲什麼？』</p>
<p>『爲什麼？』</p>
<p>他似乎不願說出來，把頭低下了傷氣地啜泣起來，我迅速摸出一塊手帕遞給他，我知道不應該這樣問，太有點難堪了。</p>
<p>『你再抽一支捲烟吧！』</p>
<p>他搖搖頭，啜泣得更厲害了。</p>
<p>我這時也被溶化在他感情裏，我不知道我這時做什麼事，我相信人類是靈感的動物，假使把感情一旦遺失在一個沉悶憂鬱的雨季，那他永遠是一種憂鬱，對世界永遠引不起好感來。</p>
<p>因此他的哭泣是逼不得已的表示。</p>
<p>『你明還來嗎？』我問。</p>
<p>他搖搖頭。</p>
<p>『後天？』</p>
<p>他也搖搖頭。</p>
<p>『甚什麼時候再來？』</p>
<p>『永遠不會再來了。』</p>
<p>『真的？』</p>
<p>『真的。』</p>
<p>『那末今晚是最後一天了？』</p>
<p>『是的，而且也是與這城的最後一天。』</p>
<p>我的心裏突然起了一陣惡心，我忙找痰盂，我忙了半天仍沒有找到，因此我想打開窗吐到外邊去，他却笑着告訴我痰盂在他身邊，但是當我走過去吐的時候，我知道他是欺騙我了，並沒有痰盂，他張開了一塊很白的手帕呌我吐在上面，但是我畢竟是掙脫了他的手，吐到窗外去。而他也感到失望似的把烟蒂拋出窗外。我不能夠了解他這時的心裏，他爲什麼須要着人類厭惡的東西。</p>
<p>『對不起。』我說，我坐到他身前的桌上，『但是你爲什麼要這東西。』</p>
<p>『我喜歡。』</p>
<p>『是你喜歡？』</p>
<p>『哈哈……』他又發出猙獰的笑，『我已接受了你所厭惡的許多許多東西……』</p>
<p>『然而我也正同你一樣，有一個時期，我太荒唐了，我需要是刺激，把日間作夜間，夜上作日間，我幾乎也犧牲了自己。當小仲馬寫茶花女的時候，他說在理想的旁邊，還有物質生活着呢！理想與物質究竟是二件太遠的事，我們不能單爲理想，而忘了物質，然而我們又不能單爲物質生活。』</p>
<p>『對啦！』他仰起頭贊同我的話，『在理想的旁邊，還有物質生活着呢！所以我是這樣簡單的要與這地方分離了。』</p>
<p>『你想到哪裏？』</p>
<p>『大後方啊！你還用問什麼？』</p>
<p>『哦！……』</p>
<p>我們又沉默了。</p>
<p>他傾聽着窗外的雨，看了看表說要走了，堅決地。</p>
<p>雨下得仍很大，他向我借了一件雨衣，抄給了我一個地址，去了。</p>
<p>他走時已有二時一刻，我也疲乏地睡去了。</p>
<p>翌日下午，我從事務所裏回來時，女傭遞給我一包東西，除我的雨衣外，附有二封信，一封是指明給我的，他謝謝我對他誠意的招待了，他說今天早晨走了，並且要求我給他轉交另一封信。</p>
<p>我因爲事務太忙了，把這信擱了二十多天，後來再去按址找尋，這人已到鄕下去住了。我再三打聽，也是茫茫然不知。這封信我一直留着，直到現在還在手邊，他是這樣的寫着：</p>
<p>『X！</p>
<p>我們要分離了。</p>
<p>我從前對你說人生是要馬虎一點，馬虎也許是愉快，但是，現在我是變了，告訴你；我已違背了我的哲學，違背了這社會所需要的哲學，我是出你意外地認真起來了。</p>
<p>這裏太不好了，我決定要換個環境，走到很遠的地方去挨苦，我把這消息告訴你，我守候你，而你却沒有來，現在我是走了，走得得奇突嗎？也許……。</p>
<p>你不恨我嗎？好，不要恨我吧，不要罣念這沒有意識的人了，他祗是給你了許多煩憂</p>
<p>我祝福你</p>
<p>健康　你狠心的X上』</p>
<p>這封信是對他的女朋友所寫的，然而字跡愈到後面愈加潦草，使我無法看出來。不過他所說的話却應驗了，直到現在，祖國勝利已一年了，人家都從後方回來了，而他的消息仍是沉沉，會不會真的如他所說永遠不再回來了。</p>
<h3>冬日</h3>
<p>— 楊立達</p>
<p>我愛看雪中的梅蕊，在冬日的清晨。</p>
<p>我愛描風中的翠竹，在冬日的陽光下。</p>
<p>我愛聽怒號的松濤，在冬日的深夜。</p>
<h3>聖女像</h3>
<p>— 文西</p>
<p>文西（Vinci　1452-1519）他不但是個名畫家，而且還是發明家，文學家，天文地理哲學數學乃至建築無所不精，可謂奇才。素描綫條之優美典雅，已爲批評家譽爲空前絕後，此作特長俱在，可算代表作。（獅）</p>
<h3>抒情小輯</h3>
<p>— 胡牧</p>
<p>一·虹</p>
<p>記得在秋夜的燈下，媽媽愛講虹的故事。</p>
<p>我每愛於雨後的天空，望着五彩的虹。</p>
<p>虹，在淺藍色的天空裏，像一座大橋樑似的跨過這靜靜的原野。</p>
<p>這一座友情的橋樑，聯合了我和她的思想，我常常在掛虹的時候，想念着她，想戀着一羣爲工作與信仰而走向遠方的朋友。</p>
<p>於是，我夜夜嚴閉着白紙窗，默默的向遠方懷念，筆下吐出遙寄的詩草。</p>
<p>於是，我幻想着媽媽所講的童話；她說到和平呈現於暴風雨後，虹，便在藍天上出現，於是自然界便面臨到春天，那是，虹就是一座真實的橋樑，把我的聲音，笑，過渡到彼岸；我望着有虹彩的天氣，柱着手杖出門去觀望，我悽念着那美麗的彩謢，我懷念着那一個遠方的正在想念着虹的女子。</p>
<p>二·水鄕</p>
<p>在山國住得很久，很少看見那一灣粼粼的碧波底水塘。山谷裏，雖然有野花，陽光，羶猩氣，但，山谷裏也有山嵐，雲，霧，霜雪呵……</p>
<p>我是一個年青的牧羊人，然而我來到江南的時候，我是眷戀着那富有詩意之菱塘呀！當着暮鴉繞着堤樹的時候，當着夕陽醉紅了半邊天的當兒，一個年紀青青的少女，穿着藕荷色的短衫，天藍色的褲子，一笑一個酒渦，一笑如一灣流水……</p>
<p>她們嗅着陽光的香，野花的香，水草的香，飄盪着的髮香。</p>
<p>我愛那明靜的水塘，當着風動綠楊的時候，水牛在塘裏洗着笨重的身體，於是我想騎着一匹驢子走過，懷念着寄居在水塘邊的姑娘們，我更懷戀着那些花田莊上工作的勞働的朋友。</p>
<p>三·河之戀</p>
<p>春天，我愛滔滔的滾滾的江流呀！黎明，我愛在河畔學唱着「嘉陵江上」的船夫曲，我懷戀一個美麗的季節，在一帶碧藍色的河上，有我們的工作同志在杭育杭育地拉縴呵！中國就好比是一隻破了的船隻，正擱在淺灘上呀！……</p>
<p>春天，河不斷的流向東方，我站在河岸之旁，遙寄給河邊的朋友們，一聲深深的祝福。</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血　112</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>這時半輪冷月，已經平西，鶴見下車，四下打量了一下，見這地方，好像郊外，否則就是東京市中極冷落的一段。面前這座建築，極像一個廣大的別墅。門面上是大廈的形式，穿過大廈，却是一所極大的花園。獨眼紳士把其餘的隨從，留在大廈內，就帶着鶴見沿着小路，走過花園，到了一所宮殿般的屋宇面前。這時雖在深宵之後，破曉之前，兩點到三點鐘之間，這所宅第內，有幾個地方，仍舊燈火輝煌；正門廣廳上，還有守衛。</p>
<p>獨眼帶着鹤见經過守衛時，僅僅點了點頭，守衛並不注意，更不盤　，可見這裏是他常來常往的所在。他把鶴見安頓在廳左一所小室內，囑咐他稍等一下，朝他笑了一笑，便逕自出去。鶴見獨自留在這小室裏，見那單眼傢伙去了，必是報告上司，大約有幾分鐘耽擱，時間頗爲從容，倒並不亟亟要看烟匣內容，且先把這小室內容欣賞一下。他注目四壁一看，知道這是一所簡單接待室，正是小人物或蜀員之類，晋謁大老的候傳室。室中佈置，頗有中國大陸意味，至少也在竭力摹倣中國大老應接室的佈置；有些屏條字畫，四壁點綴着，櫥內，桌上，各有整套的線裝和西裝書冊之類。室雖不大，坐椅倒有十餘把之多，大槪是佈置下的「冷板凳」。</p>
<p>鶴見把小室打量一過之後，便揀了一個對窗的椅子坐下，聽聽外面沒有聲息，想到自己，雖然絲毫未露行藏，不至於被人如此嚴密的監視，然也不能大意，便大大方方，取出他那精緻的小烟匣，背着窗口，毫不經意似的打開，取出一枝烟捲來。在離開烟匣的當口，早就看見臏下的幾根烟捲下面，壓着一張折着的小紙頭。在取烟捲的時候，仍舊按照表演魔術手法，乾淨利羅地，把小紙頭也夾了在手裏。</p>
<p>這種片紙傳言的玩意，還是三十年前，舊式傳遞秘密方法，萍子這時還在採用，也見得甚不高明，不是嗎？然而也要看看，這所傳遞的消息，性質若何，是否值得採用更精密更科學的方式；同時，萍子旣是黑龍會的特別會員，又在英國幹過間諜工作，勢必受過特殊訓練，姑且不論她的資質如何，關於傳遞消息方式，絕對不能這們幼稚。也許正是合着一句小說老調，她是「藝高人胆大」，她認爲在這種場合之下，這個方式已夠秘密，不致漏眼。然而她又何以再三囑咐鶴見小心這個烟匣呢？</p>
<p>鶴見這時把烟匣中的小紙片取在手中之後，忽然又改變了念頭，不想在這「危險地帶」裏拆開來看，所以立刻用手法藏在隨身的秘密所在。剛剛藏好，忽又想到萍子臨時，如此注意這件東西，也許對我極有關係，這時看了，覺非可以多些應付的準備？同時也許有些好奋心在作祟，便決定從那隨身的秘密袋內，取出字片來，看了再說。</p>
<p>想定了主意，便借着取火燃烟的手法，把那小紙取出，又把隨身記事冊和鉛筆也拿了出來，好像要記載什麼似的，把那小紙片，剛好鋪在上面，預備仔細檢視。誰知那張紙片，也同記事冊上的紙張一樣，連一個字跡，一點筆劃也沒有，竟是雪白的一張紙片，翻來覆去，什麼也沒有。鶴見這時想想，不覺自己有些好笑。搗了半天鬼，原來是這麼一回事。因想到萍子這個丫頭，十分頑皮，也許她又在故意惡作劇哩。</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<h3>出版</h3>
<p>— 少夫</p>
<p>在電車上遇到一個朋友，閒談中他問我報紙的銷數如何，此戰前怎樣，我說總數是遠超過戰前了。因他這一問題，使我想起八年戰爭的進步。以報紙來說，無論上海南京，或國內其它城市，每種報紙一般地都較戰前爲多，這是證明敎育文化的較前普及，人民對於新聞時事的需要了解較前增多，這現象自然是可喜的。</p>
<p>可惜，可喜的程度畢竟是有限度的，而在這有限度的可喜程度中，却不斷地橫遭打擊和摧殘，瞻念前途，不得不忽然憂之！</p>
<p>有兩個例子在說明這一打擊的嚴重性：</p>
<p>其一，以上海報紙而論，十分之十都是大多數銷行在本市，其中具有全國性而發行數字最好的報紙也不例外，自然，報紙在它的所在地，應該較外埠銷行爲多，但如果不成其爲比例時，那其中定有問题，問题，就在交通與郵資。</p>
<p>其二，再看一看各種期刊雜誌，勝利後一年來，總樂數普遍地較戰前降低，原因在歷來各種期刊雜誌的主要發行在外埠，換言之，歷來是外埠讀者數字超過本市讀者的。</p>
<p>交通阻塞是一個打擊，郵資狂漲是一種摧殘，還談什麼文化流通。一個國家倘使不用種種方法來獎勵文化事業，已經是在放棄進步，倘使再反過來加以摧殘，那就更不堪設想了。</p>
<p>文化界出版界對這一現狀是應該聯合起來大聲呼籲的！</p>
<h3>女人的天下</h3>
<p>— 文華</p>
<p>「唯我烏托邦」訪問記</p>
<p>昨晚臨睡之前我多吃了點溶化了的乳酪。在和枕頭捕鬥了四個回合之後，我只得放棄了睡眠，開了電燈伸手拿過了晚報。在第一頁上我讀到一段新聞說：「在下次的選舉中女人將要投百分之六十的票。」</p>
<p>「怎麼樣？」我囁嚅道：「每一次那些女孩子們聚攏在一個計劃上，她們總是能够强佔一切而進行事物來適合她們自己的。」</p>
<p>忽然那些鉛字在我眼前模糊起來好像一隻照相機失去了焦點；於是我覺得我自己走進了一條奇怪的路。牠看上去好像紐約，但是牠是奇怪的變更了。</p>
<p>在一所好像熟悉的建築物之前，我看見一個警察立在一個小的金的座脚上。他有六呎三吋窩，而且他的制服好像是齊格飛歌舞劇中的壓軸戲。</p>
<p>「這所了不得的建築物是甚麼？」我問他：</p>
<p>「這是大中央撲粉室，」他答道：「値三千萬。每一個城市都有像這麼的一個。」</p>
<p>女人當權</p>
<p>我開始有點明白了，於是問道：「是不是那些女人正在當權掌理這個國家？」</p>
<p>「並不完全如此，」他吿訴我：「你以爲一個女人會選舉另一個女人嗎？但是她們只選舉那些她們所喜歡的男人，現在是潘克的第二任總統了。」</p>
<p>「她們把那些政客都趕出去了嗎？」我問道：</p>
<p>「只是那些醜陋的，那些可上鏡頭的角色—詹姆士福來斯托，保羅麥克納特，伯納巴魯起。艾遜霍華—比以前有勢力多了。且說，讓我看看你的結婚證。」</p>
<p>「那是甚麼？」</p>
<p>結婚證書</p>
<p>「每一個男人都要帶一張的，牠註明了你的年紀，進款和胸闊；要是一個男人到了三十歲還没有結婚。政府就要强通他去帶嬰孩，許多事情都已變過了。付款的支票是一直寄給主婦們，道樣省去了那中間人。每一個丈夫當他從辦公室回來一定要馬上去剃鬍子，而且食量大的男人只能有和水的麸皮吃。還有，那些女人用不着和她的丈夫接吻，除非她高興。</p>
<p>「要是一個女人到了二十九歲，」他繼續下去：「她們可以燒掉她的出生證書。這樣沒有人可以知道她的年紀。一年十二個月中有六個月是稱爲六月。」</p>
<p>「錢幣恐怕會把你攪昏。新紙幣的階級是：＄.98＄4.98和＄9.98，零碎找頭也是一樣的。但是公共汽車上的賣票員，却一定要接受一位太太從手提包中掏出的第一枚錢幣，即使一枚無用的徽章在電車和公共汽車上，也是通用的貨幣。</p>
<p>種種適應</p>
<p>「學校裏正在敎授寫讀和倫擺舞，巧古力冰淇淋是分開兩半出賣的，使得女孩子們用不着咬開來就知道裏面是甚麼。鎊秤是規定了要輕十鎊。而鏡子都是製得可以使肥胖臃腫的女人看上去輕巧。」</p>
<p>「再會，奴隸。穿過馬路時當心點！」他說，當他轉回到交通道路上去：「那些女太太們通過了一條法律允許她們在兩邊駕駛。」</p>
<p>當我走開，沈迷在思索中，一輛漂亮的粉紅色的轎車忽然不知從那裏衝出來了。只聽見一陣尖銳的剎車聲音，然後一切都沈靜了。我醒轉來發現我的太太正把冷的綳帶放到我的頭上去，而且柔聲的安慰我。</p>
<p>「我作了一個最愚狂的夢，達令，」我說：「我夢見女人正在管理一切察情去適合她們自己。你想多可笑？」</p>
<p>「當然這是可笑的，」她同意道：「且說，親愛的，我的姊姊和她的孩子們明天要來和我們住一個月，我已經給你預備好了一個舒服的小床在櫊樓頂上。」（完）（譯自十一月份「讀者文摘」）</p>

<p>橋上張飛</p>
<p>橋頭拉車是小鬼們的好缺。上海蘇州路兩岸，橋樑爲數不少，在彎曲形的大橋上通車，是一件呌車夫吃力的事。從前，祇有人力車，現在又添加了三輪車，三輪車上常坐着兩位客人，登橋之初，車夫再也無力踏得動機輪，祇好下車前推，但還是勁力不够；這時自有預伏橋頭的老弟兄帮的意丐或成人小鬼從後推動。這一份義務差事，小鬼們有時是事先徵得車上人同意然後賣力的，但多數是在不甚同意的情形下便動手了的。等到推上橋頭，車上客再也不得不破鈔了。一舉手之勞，兩三分鐘之間，便可以領取酬報。在戰前是銅元幾枚，現在却非百元票莫辦了。這種推車的行業　帮中人稱爲「張飛上拉諸葛亮」。簡稱爲「張飛上」。這個名詞眞有點來得突兀，但據說是有來源的。諸葛亮慣坐孔明車，是需要人來推動的。其所以稱呼坐車人爲諸葛亮，而自命爲張飛，是爲了帮中人最佩服豪爽的張飛。</p>
<p>每個橋樑分左右二班，每日夜各分三班輪値。每班自成一個小組，約三四人成一小組。但橋樑地段是屬於爺叔班子的。凡是佔有橋樑的爺叔，他們自己不用動手，祇須有時從旁觀望，而由屬下的小鬼去做「張飛」的工作。每班每人都須盡數交帳，然後再分派十份之三四給小鬼。爺叔們可以坐享俸祿，其利潤是很可觀的。</p>
<p>橋樑地位有肥瘦之分，入款相差數極大，但每個佔有橋樑美缺的爺叔是絕不肯輕易放棄的。爭奪橋樑在從前也常有過，那是一幕可怕的血戰，但結果仍不得解決，因爲即使原主失敗了，也往往不肯干休。不久這後，仍然編練新軍前來報仇的。那口號和「收復失地」差不多。近來此風已汪流行了。每個橋樑早已坐鎭有人，侵略者的陰謀總無從實現。</p>
<p>如有落魄的洋盤丐流見獵心喜，居然也想自動推車以獲酬金，那是辦不到的。至少須遭受原帮小鬼們一頓毒打。究竟利之所在，是不容外人染指的。</p>

<h3>且談「誤人子弟」</h3>
<p>— 方成</p>
<p>敎書先生的話</p>
<p>前幾天讀到本刊聖潔先生的「誤人子弟」一文，不禁使我回憶到過去生活的片斷。</p>
<p>粉筆生涯已經放棄了好久的我，爲了友誼關係，上學期又在本市一個私立中學裏坐了半年冷板櫈。—其實是站立了四百多個鐘頭—所擔任的是高初中三班國文。現在一般中學生對於國文一科，似乎不會感到有多大的興趣，尤其是課本中的敎材，十之八九是枯燥無味的古文。每次上課的時候，縱使講得天花亂墜，舌敝唇焦，而能够全神貫注側耳靜聽的學生，實在少得可憐。有時當胸跨上講台，翻開課文預備講解的時候，頑皮的學生，甚至會站起來要求講幾個故事給他們聽聽，眞會使你啼笑皆非。最感頭痛的是二百多本文卷，不是文不對題，狗屁不通，便是別字連篇，不可卒讀。雖然也有稍加潤飾，即可成誦的作品，可是鳳毛麟角，不可多得。這種文卷，你想爲其批改，簡直無從下筆，有時把原卷發還重做，第二次繳上來的，依然是「不知所云」，使你無法修削。這種情形，當初還以爲是自己敎導無方所得的後果，於是變化了許多敎學方法，可是仍然得不到顯著的成效。因此在學期終了前的一個月，校長先生請我下學期再帮帮忙的時候，我就婉却了，承校長的情，再四挽留，我便講了一則笑話給他聽：</p>
<p>秀才之罪</p>
<p>「從前有一個秀才先生，死了以後，被閻王傳去訊問。秀才跨進閻羅大殿，看見閻王正在審問一個強盜，祇好站在階下屛息靜候。一會兒那個強盜笑迷迷地退下來了，據說是宣吿無罪。秀才以爲強盜尙且饒赦，自己一定沒有問題，便踱着方步走上殿去。閻王看見秀才，劈頭便問：『你生前幹什麼的？』秀才說：『我是敎書爲業的。』閻王聽了，便怒形於色，吩咐牛頭馬面把秀才押到『拔舌』地獄裏去。秀才弄得丈二和尙摸不着頭腦，就大喊寃枉，說：『大王太不公平！強盜殺人越貨，罪大噁極，尙且赦其無罪，生員讀書明理，安分守己，從未作奸犯科，何以受此重罰，請問大王，生員所犯何罪？』閻王冷笑着說：『你還不知道嗎？』說着便提起筆來，在紙上畫了幾筆，擲在秀才面前，秀才仔細一看，原來是『誤人子弟』四個大字，於是俯首無言，隨着鬼差鎯鐺入獄。」</p>
<p>校長先生聽了笑着對我說：「你是不是恐怕將來也入拔舌地獄嗎？」我也笑着回說：「這倒未必，祇是敎了半年書，敎不出什麽成績來，良心上的譴責實在太深啊！」</p>
<p>本學期，我終於辭了缷了這個職務。</p>
<h3>妙手</h3>
<p>— 逸民</p>
<p>日昨飯後，在弄口散步遠眺，見一穿短打漢子，頭載呢帽，匆匆向前跑。弄口一小販說此毳手也，於是靜觀演變，見他行近一行人身旁時，脫下呢帽放在右臂上，從行人左側而過，左手自右手帽下伸入此行人袋內，再伸出，已到手一束鈔票，行動敏捷輕巧，此行人毫不知覺，我正想去喊醒此行人，不料旁邊小販說，不要響，他們勢力大，組織密，有連絡，外人管閒事準吃生活，於是只得眼看毳手揚長而去，此小販又說，應急忙追目的物因有地段關係，再過去他就不能侵佔同行利益了。我想中國社會的下層階級竟有如此嚴密組織，並且嚴守幫規，所可惜的是不守正道。據說上次全市毳手大遊行，非但不能改變他們的習性，當釋放後反變本加厲的謹愼行事了。</p>
<h3>美國工人工作時間　每年只一天</h3>
<p>— 建華</p>
<p>有人問一美國敎授：『貴國工人，究有多少工作時間，是不是在開夜車？』不料這位美敎授竟回答說：『美國工人的工作時間，每年只有一日。』他是這樣計算的：</p>
<p>一年共三百六十五天。</p>
<p>睡眠時間，每天八小時，合一百二十二天。</p>
<p>休息時間，每天八小時，合一百二十二天。</p>
<p>星期日停工，合五十二天。</p>
<p>紀念日例假，共十八天。（美國）</p>
<p>飮食時間，每天兩小時，合三十二天。</p>
<p>每年節假，共十八天。（美國）</p>
<p>他像煞有介事的算着說：『照此計算，不是工作時間，只有一天嗎？對不對？』</p>

<h3>民盟要角　黃炎培</h3>
<p>— 甘來</p>
<p>曾出席政治協商會議的民盟常委黃炎培先生，是一位職業敎育專家，歷史悠久，成績卓著的中華職業敎育社和學校，就是他發起創辦的。</p>
<p>黃先生是壬寅舉人。今年六十九歲，這位魁梧的身軀，大塊頭，方面孔的文人，從外貎看，誰會猜想到他是一位學者和政黨要人呢？</p>
<p>關於黃氏的私生活，佳話遍傳，十幾年前，他載了眼鏡，蓄起鬍子，到了望七之年，元配病歿，重續新絃，鬍鬚反而剃得乾乾凈凈，顯得滿臉春風，返老還童。</p>
<p>他主張茹素，元配王糾思女士生時親任烹飪，據說，靑菜豆腐之中，暗以豬油熬之，淸湯則和以童鷄汁，味特鮮美，黃先生不知眞相，所以遇有友人設素食召宴，黃氏常搖頭不能下咽。</p>
<p>當徐國樑長上海警察廳時代，黃氏正創辦中華職業學校，每日到校辦公，一天，分畢離校，適逢內急，便在校門竹籬附近解溲，旁邊有一個魯莽的警察，不問情由，打了黃先生幾下巴掌，口中還駡個不休，黃氏受辱，自不甘心，默記該警符號，用電話向徐吿明經過，徐立將該警革職。</p>
<p>在黃先生六十歲那一年，怱患盲腸炎，幸療治得愈，他便寫了一部「斷腸集」著作，以資紀念。</p>
<p>黃先生凡事皆抱樂觀，談話演講，時黨插入幽默的語氣，演說時言語中喜用「兄弟」兩字，他說的雖是國語，但一聽便可以辨出浦東口音。</p>
<p>他喜歡遊歷，曾到過國內各地和日本·朝鮮·美國·菲律賓·南洋等處。聖約翰大學曾把哲學博士名譽學位贈給他。</p>
<p>有人把黃炎培先生稱作「老少年」，自然很名符其實。</p>

<h3>The Seventh National Assembly Session Passes Proposal to Extend Deadline for Constitutional Draft Submissions; Frontier Issues Attract Attention from Entire Assembly</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 3rd] The Seventh National Assembly session was held on the morning of the 3rd. By 9:10 AM, 1,162 delegates had arrived, and the meeting was declared open, with Kong Geng serving as chair. The secretariat read the minutes of the sixth meeting and congratulatory telegrams for the opening of the Assembly, as well as letters and telegrams of leave from delegates. Later, the Deputy Secretary-General announced the decisions of the ninth meeting of the Presidium: (1) The deadline for receiving proposals would be December 5th; (2) Each unit comprising the Comprehensive Review Committee should nominate three individuals before 12:00 noon on the 3rd, and submit the lists to the Presidium. Subsequently, several delegates rose to speak, arguing that the widespread expression of opinions had not yet reached a universal level, and that the vast majority of those who wanted to express their views had not been able to do so. They hoped that the deadline for receiving proposals could be extended. Deputy Secretary-General Lei reiterated that after the deadline for receiving proposals, the Assembly would continue to be held, with plenary sessions in the mornings and committee reviews in the afternoons, proceeding in tandem, which would expedite the sorting of proposals. As the atmosphere in the Assembly Hall increasingly favored extending the deadline, the Chairman put it to a vote. As a result, the opinion to extend the deadline for expressing opinions and submitting proposals to 12:00 noon on December 7th was passed with a majority of 845 votes. At the beginning of the meeting, Delegate Sun Shengwu spoke first, believing that the Xinjiang and Mongolian delegates had come from afar and worked extremely hard, and should be allowed to speak first. The frontier delegates listened and applauded warmly. Subsequently, Zhang Kailian, Wang Zemin, Huang Mengfei, An Futing, Guo Zhongxing, Ren Zhuoxuan, Ahemaitijiang, Aisa, Yang Zhizhong, Dengzhunam, Luo Jialun, and others spoke in succession. On the morning of the 6th, the focus of the speeches was on frontier delegates, and the issues raised focused on ethnic minorities in the frontier regions. As these matters concerned national politics, they were able to attract the attention of all delegates in the Assembly Hall. The Assembly adjourned at 12:00 noon.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 3rd] The Seventh National Assembly session continued on the afternoon of the 3rd at 3:40 PM, with 1,124 delegates present. Delegate Liu Henghengjing (female) served as chair. After the meeting commenced, a broad discussion of the Draft Constitution of the Republic of China continued. Hubei Delegate Meng Xianzhang, Shandong Delegate Gu Chi, Beiping Delegate Sun Shengwu, Independent Professional Delegate Jiang Yiping, Hebei Delegate Qu Zhisheng, Jiangxi Delegate Yang Dupu, Youth Party Delegate Song Yiqing, Shanxi Delegate Liang Shangdong, Liaobei Delegate Liu Guozeng, Hunan Delegate Liu Ziya, and Hubei Delegate Qiu Jianyuan spoke in succession. The main points of discussion were still (1) the issue of the capital city in the draft constitution, with some advocating for Beiping or Wuhan as the capital, and others advocating for multiple secondary capitals; (2) alterations to the territory of the Republic of China, with some advocating that no alterations should be made without the decision of the National Assembly; (3) the issue of adding professional representatives; (4) the powers of the Legislative Yuan and the Executive Yuan. At 4:50 PM, there was a ten-minute break. Afterwards, the secretariat announced twenty-four written opinions on the draft constitution submitted by twenty-four delegates, including Ye Suzhong, Zhang Yuanruo, Huang Guoshu, Leng Xin, and Zhang Daoxing. The meeting adjourned at 6:08 PM.</p>
<p>[Additional Telegram] The 3rd marked the 18th day since the opening of the National Assembly. Youth Party Delegate Li Yuhua and Regional Delegate Ma Shaowu reported their arrival, bringing the total number of delegates who have reported to 1,654.</p>
<h3>Delegates' Speeches in the Morning Focused on Frontier Ethnic Minorities</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 3rd] The important speeches of the delegates during the Seventh National Assembly session on the morning of the 3rd were as follows:</p>
<p>Zhang Kailian: Article 7, which designates Nanjing as the capital, should be deleted, as no other constitution in the world has such a provision. Article 11, Section 114, which stipulates that provinces may convene provincial people's representative assemblies to formulate provincial self-government laws based on the Provincial and County Self-Government Regulations, should be changed to allow for free formulation.</p>
<p>Wang Zemin: The Draft Constitution of the Republic of China should be based on the spirit of the Three Principles of the People and the Five-Power Constitution, and should take the 1946 Draft Constitution as its principle.</p>
<p>Huang Mengfei: Regarding the relationship between the Legislative Yuan and the Control Yuan, how can we make it ideal? According to this draft constitution, the Legislative Yuan exercises executive power, rendering the National Assembly useless, with only the power to elect the president, which can be said to be only half of an electoral power. Using parliamentary politics, the National Assembly and the Legislative Yuan can hold meetings simultaneously without friction, but this would lead to a hybrid system that is neither fish nor fowl. Therefore, if the regulations for parliament are not proper, the parliament will also become autocratic. We believe that the National Assembly should have the power to impeach the Control Yuan and the Legislative Yuan in order to achieve balance.</p>
<p>An Futing: Add a chapter on social security and stipulate an electoral system for professional representatives.</p>
<p>Guo Zhongxing: During the Northern Expedition and the eight-year War of Resistance, workers made their greatest efforts. Workers have made great contributions to the country, so there is ample justification for including professional representatives in the electoral college.</p>
<p>Ren Zhuoxuan (i.e., Ye Qing): This draft constitution is a kind of form between a representative system and the Five-Power Constitution. We have the following opinions on this: (1) There are three types of representatives in the National Assembly, and the people have to elect three times. I believe that the people should only elect once. (2) Members of the Legislative Yuan and Control Yuan should not be delegates to the National Assembly. Furthermore, Sun Ke's explanation that representatives elected from various places will focus on local interests is completely inconsistent with the facts. (3) The National Assembly does not have the power to amend a constitution formulated by the National Assembly, which is extremely unreasonable. (4) We must transform reality with ideals and advance reality. Our ideal is the Five-Power Constitution. If we deviate from ideals to formulate a constitution, it will not be a plan for a hundred years, but a plan for one or two years. We should follow the ideal of the Five-Power Constitution, adopt the strengths of European and American systems as much as possible, and jointly create the most advanced political system of world democracy.</p>
<h3>Joint Land and Air Exercise to Entertain National Assembly Delegates</h3>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 3rd] Students from military academies in the capital and garrison troops, including infantry, cavalry, artillery, air force, and paratroopers, are scheduled to hold a joint military exercise on land and in the air at the Ming Palace airfield on the 8th of this month to welcome National Assembly delegates. General Tang Enbo, commander of the Nanjing Garrison, will command the exercise. After the exercise, Tang will host the delegates.</p>
<p>Ahemaitijiang: I am a representative from Xinjiang, coming from the frontier. I have the following opinions on the draft constitution: (1) Article 5, which states that all ethnic groups in the Republic of China are equal, should not only be written down but also be truly implemented. (2) Under Article 5, the original names of all ethnic groups and a high degree of ethnic autonomy should be clearly stipulated. (3) A chapter on ethnic minorities should be added after Chapter 11 and Chapter 12, i.e., after the chapter on provincial and county systems. (4) Xinjiang should be granted a high degree of ethnic autonomy.</p>
<p>Aisa: It is very regrettable that the draft constitution fails to clearly define the autonomous rights of ethnic minorities in the country. This draft constitution was drafted under the leadership of the Kuomintang and failed to comply with Sun Yat-sen's teachings. Article 4 of the Outline of National Reconstruction clearly stipulates the status of all ethnic groups, and the declaration of the First National Congress also recognizes the rights of ethnic autonomy and self-defense. The resolution of the Second Plenary Session grants ethnic equality and autonomy to ethnic minorities, but these are not clearly stipulated in the draft constitution. In the frontier regions, there have been many bloody tragedies over the years. Some say that this is due to dissatisfaction with reality and a fondness for creating disturbances. In fact, this is due to the government's lack of good policies, the misjudgment of a small number of people, and the insults of a small number of people. These are all historical records. Corrupt officials and greedy bureaucrats arrive in the frontier regions and do as they please, extracting as much as they can, shifting responsibility, and letting them take responsibility. Everything should be done to save the situation, and this should not happen again. The constitution should have very good regulations. If there is no guarantee of autonomy, freedom, and survival, bloodshed is inevitable. We hope to obtain a high degree of ethnic autonomy, which is autonomy above independence. The reasons are as follows: (1) Independent, autonomous, and free are basic human requirements for people around the world, and Xinjiang compatriots are no exception. (2) Our neighbors in the Soviet Union, who are of the same blood, race, and religion, have all obtained federal autonomous status. The Kazakhs, Uzbeks, and Afghans are all Muslims. The 100 million Muslims in India are not satisfied with proportional equality and want to divide India in half to implement autonomy. This greatly affects our emotions. (3) The trends of the world are changing rapidly. We do not agree with any ethnic group that does not obtain autonomous territories. Finally, he emphasized: Now, some people believe that the demands for autonomy by ethnic minorities in the country are a movement for division and independence, but in fact, it is a sacred and free movement. If our sacred freedom is guaranteed, there will naturally be no division movement. For example, the United States is a free country, so there is no division movement. Wherever there is a lack of freedom, there is a division movement. Therefore, if we cannot achieve our goals, we will inevitably take this path in the future. All movements in history have been for survival and for freedom.</p>
<p>Yang Zhizhong: I am a representative of the indigenous ethnic minorities in the southwest. I have the following opinions: In Chapters 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13, a few words should be added: "In provinces with indigenous ethnic minorities, elections should be conducted in proportion to the population." Our indigenous ethnic minorities are scattered in Guizhou, Hunan, Yunnan, and Guangxi. None of them are doing well like the Han Chinese. Quoting Mr. Aisa, in the past, corrupt officials and greedy bureaucrats were responsible, but in the future, the Chinese National Assembly will be responsible.</p>
<p>Dengzhunam: I am from the Ba'an people of Xikang. As you all know, millions of compatriots in the frontier are looking forward to everyone's sympathy and cultivation. They believe that the central government should treat all ethnic groups equally. My opinion is that education and various facilities in the frontier regions should be developed in a balanced manner so that the entire country has a future. In particular, women in the frontier regions should also be guaranteed employment.</p>
<p>Luo Jialun: He paid much attention to civil rights, but neglected the people's livelihood. In the chapter on basic national policies, the protection of workers is too neglected. Article 139 should be amended to read: "The state shall enable tillers to have their land, and laborers to have their work and livelihood guaranteed." Article 141, "Private wealth and private enterprises shall be protected," has a capitalist tone. In the examination chapter, the provision that it should transcend party affiliations is too vague. For example, the Kuomintang should not interfere, and the Youth Party and the Democratic Socialist Party should also withdraw from schools and examination institutions. Furthermore, the audit agency should be superior to the Control Yuan and should have the power to report corrupt officials and greedy bureaucrats.</p>
<h3>List of Constitutional Draft Review Committee Members Likely to be Proposed at Today's Assembly; Presidium Discusses Conveners of Each Group</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 3rd] The list of group members for the Constitutional Draft Review Committee is largely complete, and the Presidium is considering the conveners of each group. Furthermore, the list of representatives nominated by various units to participate in the Comprehensive Review Committee has been received from more than forty units, and the remaining units will also submit them to the Secretariat of the Assembly for forwarding to the Presidium. The complete list of members of the Constitutional Committee is expected to be proposed at the Assembly on the 4th.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 3rd] The Presidium of the National Assembly held a meeting at 4:45 PM on the afternoon of the 3rd, presided over by Hu Shuhua, and decided to hold the eighth meeting on the 4th, from 9:00 AM to 12:00 noon, presided over by Hu Shuhua, and from 3:00 PM to 6:00 PM, chaired by Wang Yunwu, to continue a broad discussion of the constitutional draft. The Presidium also decided to hold another meeting during the recess of the afternoon session.</p>
<h3>Representatives from Jilin and Liaoning Both Advocate for Establishing the Capital in Beiping</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 3rd] During the National Assembly session on the afternoon of the 3rd, the speeches of the delegates were as follows: Hubei Delegate Meng Xianzhang: (1) The amendments to the draft constitution are more progressive than the 1946 draft constitution in terms of political regulations, but not in terms of economic regulations. If the people have no economic rights, how can their political rights be guaranteed? This point needs to be supplemented. (2) Within a country, ethnic heroes are not to be feared, but rather the lack of correct ethnic policies. Autonomy and unity are two sides of the same coin and are by no means contradictory. We should use cool heads and far-sighted eyes to solve this problem.</p>
<p>Shandong Professional Delegate Gu Chi: The election of professional organizations and women's organizations must be included in the constitution. Beiping Delegate Sun Shengwu: (1) The National Assembly is not a party meeting and should not excessively accommodate the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference. Moreover, the Political Consultative Conference did not have frontier representatives participating, so the resolutions are indeed lacking in comprehensiveness. (2) Article 5, regarding the equality of all ethnic groups in the country, is insufficient and should be amended to include assistance to weak ethnic minorities. (3) Although Article 8 stipulates that all people in the country are equal regardless of religion, there are very few Muslim representatives at this meeting. In the election of the Twelfth Army, a certain number of seats should be added to each province for religious people with special customs. (4) Regarding the opinion of a high degree of autonomy in the frontier areas, he believes that after the implementation of the constitution, all governors below the provincial level should be publicly elected, and all problems should be solved. As for the system of autonomy above independence proposed by Delegate Aisa this morning, it lacks concrete measures.</p>
<p>Independent Professional Delegate Jiang Yiping: The national situation requires a strong and capable government. Therefore, while preventing the phenomenon of centralization of power, the power to govern should be developed as much as possible. However, in the amendments, the Executive Yuan is excessively controlled by the Legislative Yuan. The Premier of the Executive Yuan not only cannot act freely but must also lobby the Legislative Yuan extensively before taking any action, which affects public affairs. He hopes that representatives of all parties can share the same goal as the people's representatives, amend this point in accordance with Mr. Sun Yat-sen's principle of a capable government with five separate powers, and make the Legislative Yuan and others responsible to the National Assembly so that the people can supervise the government with political power.</p>
<p>Hebei Professional Delegate Qu Zhisheng: The capital is the nerve center of a country, and its location should be rigidly stipulated in the constitution. However, where it should be located should be discussed and decided with a calm, fair, and impartial attitude.</p>
<p>Jiangxi Professional Delegate Yang Dupu: (1) The principle of dividing power and enabling five powers to be independent must be ensured. (2) The protection of the people's lives and health should be stipulated, and a public medical system should be adopted.</p>
<p>Jilin Delegate Li Wenpu: A. Please establish the capital in Beiping. (1) From a national defense perspective, establishing the capital in Beiping can be close to the Northeast and Northwest, and the phenomenon of chaos and disaster in the north can also be changed. (2) In terms of climate, the northern climate is beneficial to physical and mental health and administrative efficiency. (3) In terms of culture, Beiping is the cultural center of our country. The atmosphere is pure and simple, unlike Nanjing, which is often affected by the financial economy of Shanghai, leading to extravagance. B. The terms of office of National Assembly delegates, the president, vice president, and members of the Legislative Yuan and Control Yuan should all be reduced to four years, and the National Assembly should meet every two years.</p>
<p>Shanxi Professional Delegate Liang Shangdong: (1) Mr. Sun Yat-sen's lifelong revolution and struggle were all for the implementation of the Three Principles of the People. The first article should be clearly named "The Republic of the Three Principles of the People." (2) Article 4, changes to the national territory must be approved by the National Assembly. (3) All professional organizations should elect representatives to participate in the National Assembly and the Legislative Yuan and Control Yuan. (4) The name of the "Basic National Policies" chapter is inappropriate, and many of the articles are also far-fetched. For example, in Article 37, the provisions regarding the United Nations Charter are not necessary.</p>
<p>Liaobei Regional Delegate Liu Guozeng: (1) The content of the draft constitution does not match the preface and is not based on Mr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings in founding the Republic of China and should be corrected. (2) The words "government of the people, by the people, and for the people" in the first article are superfluous. (3) Article 4, territorial changes must be approved by the National Assembly. (4) The capital should be established in Beiping. (5) The phrase "without distinction of gender, religion, race, class, or party affiliation" in Article 8 should be deleted. (6) The right to survival should be added to the rights and duties of the people.</p>
<p>Hunan Delegate Liu Ziya: I have another proposal on the currency issue, please pay attention to it.</p>
<p>Hubei Delegate Qiu Jianyuan: (1) Request detailed agricultural policies to alleviate the suffering of farmers. (2) Determine the status and treatment of soldiers to reward their hard work. (3) Move the capital to Wuhan.</p>
<p>Hebei Delegate Zhao Zimao: (1) In the election of National Assembly delegates, professional organizations and compatriots in the border areas should participate universally. (2) The National Assembly should meet once a year, and the resident representative assembly should exercise its powers on its behalf during the adjournment. (3) In the formulation of laws, the Chinese National Assembly should decide on the principles, and the Legislative Yuan, composed of experts and scholars elected by the Chinese National Assembly, should formulate them. (4) The National Assembly should have broad powers to remove officials of the central government.</p>
<h3>Democratic Socialist Party Participates in the National Assembly to Complete the Main Constitution</h3>
<p>Sun Baoyi Makes a Speech in Shanghai</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City] The China Democratic Socialist Party held a Central Standing Committee meeting at the Fanwei on the afternoon of the 1st. Zhang Junmai, Wu Xianzi, Xu Fulin, Tang Zhuxin, Sha Yankai, Sun Baogang, and Sun Baoyi attended. According to Sun Baoyi, the party's Shanghai spokesperson, on the 3rd, the meeting had a wide-ranging discussion on general issues and finally reached a concrete resolution, namely, that the party would participate in the National Assembly in order to complete the democratic constitution. Other issues, such as participation in the government, were separate from the National Assembly, and the party had not yet considered them. In addition, this person was appointed as the party's Shanghai spokesperson, and Xu Fulin and Jiang Yuntian were appointed as the party's Nanjing spokespersons. Moreover, among the standing committee members who participated in the Central Standing Committee meeting, except for Xu Fulin, who took a train to Pukou on the morning of the 3rd, the rest were all in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Thai Ambassador to China Arrives in Shanghai; Scheduled to Go to Nanjing Within Ten Days to Present Credentials; Vows to Strive to Foster Good Relations</h3>
<p>[This City] The first Thai Ambassador to China, Sanguon Lulaak, arrived in Shanghai the night before last and will go to Nanjing around the 9th or 10th of this month to meet President Chiang and present his credentials. The Ambassador also met with reporters from the Central News Agency yesterday and said that he would devote himself to improving Sino-Thai relations and making them better day by day. During this visit to China, he will discuss various issues of Sino-Thai trade with the Chinese government. Thai rice, timber, and rubber can be transported to China, and China also has several materials needed by Thailand. Sino-Thai diplomatic relations were very good before the war. The local overseas Chinese and Thais have always lived in harmony. Later, due to the outbreak of the war and the influence of the Japanese, Sino-Thai disputes arose, one example of which was the unrest not long ago. However, this kind of problem has gradually decreased, and the fundamental way to improve it is to educate the people of both sides so that they can understand and cooperate with each other. In the future, relations between the two countries will naturally be even better. Talking about the current situation in Thailand, the Ambassador said that since the end of the war, the lives of the people of Thailand have not been as good as before the war, but compared to other countries, it is considered good. The people still have sufficient food to eat, and there are also more political problems than before the war. Thailand and France have also reached an understanding and have sent ambassadors to each other. The French Ambassador will arrive in Thailand in the spring. Thailand is also preparing to set up consulates in Shanghai, Shantou, and Haikou in the future. When reporters asked him about his impression of China, the Ambassador said that he secretly went to Chongqing from the border during the War of Resistance in 1943 to meet President Chiang and had a very good impression of China. He also said that many Thais are of Chinese descent. Bili, who recently visited China, and the ancestors of the Thai Prime Minister were all Chinese. The Ambassador himself's father was also from Fujian, China.

<h3>British Troops Invade Shenzhen and Kill One of Our Villagers on the Spot</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 3rd] Reporters learned tonight from reliable sources that a group of British armed forces destroyed our country's sovereignty today. It is reported that they invaded Shenzhen from Kowloon this afternoon and killed one of our villagers. British police stationed in the border area of Kowloon admitted to the unfortunate incident when reporters went to inquire and said that they are currently investigating, so they refused to disclose details. It is reported that a group of British troops invaded Shenzhen at 2:00 PM today with the aim of arresting two Chinese youths. It is said that the two men smuggled a large amount of flour from British territory. The Chinese troops stationed in Shenzhen drove them back because the British army's move violated our country's sovereignty. However, an hour later, they invaded again with some reinforcements, but were still blocked by our army. Chinese villagers gathered to watch. It is reported that the British army then opened fire and killed one villager.</p>
<h3>Contentious Debates on Frontier Affairs at the Convention</h3>
<p>— Our Reporter Zhang Ming, Pu Dejie</p>
<p>—A Record of Anecdotes from the Seventh National Assembly</p>
<p>By the seventh session of the National Assembly, the extensive expression of opinions had already caused a sense of weariness from the relentless bombardment of words. However, today's session offered a different flavor. The demands of the frontier representatives and their fervent hopes placed on the government reminded everyone present of those remote regions, vital components of the Republic of China.</p>
<p>Representative Ahmet Hong, representing the Xinjiang compatriots, wore a crimson velvet hat with black edges and black flowers, paired with a Western suit. Sporting a tuft of a beard and a robust physique, his eyes gleamed with spirit. However, he could not speak Mandarin. Therefore, for the first time in a domestic conference within the Republic of China, interpreters were used.</p>
<p>Aisha spoke fluent Mandarin, voicing the most urgent demands and the most serious problems. He began with a stark warning: "Xinjiang is the most important issue for the entire nation. China is like a house, and Xinjiang is like the walls and doors of that house. If the house is gone, what good are the walls and doors? I ask for a little more of your time, so you may see what our walls and doors look like."</p>
<p>Deng Zhunam, a female compatriot from the frontier, attended as a representative of distinguished members of society. Her speech gave equal weight to frontier, ethnic, and women's issues. As a professor at the Central Political University, her demeanor was extremely steady and she was very popular.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the assembly, someone suggested bringing out the draft constitution discussed in the preparatory meeting of the National Assembly for joint study, but this call did not resonate, perhaps because it was too far off-topic.</p>
<p>Not long after the assembly began, a slight misunderstanding occurred in the venue. Representative Wu Jingxiong had submitted a written opinion to the presidium, which was read by Deputy Secretary-General Lei. The key point of the opinion was to stipulate the electoral system for professional representatives. However, a trade union representative in the back left corner mistakenly believed that Wu's opinion was to "not clearly stipulate the election of professional representatives." Thus, he shouted, "Please Representative Wu explain the reasons, or else we will 'all walk out!'" Chaos ensued. News reporters and venue staff rushed to the scene, but Deputy Secretary-General Lei's explanation immediately defused the situation. Almost as if news reporters were ready to transfer their position, with some considering that corner to be the powder keg of the assembly venue.</p>
<p>Minister Zhang Lisheng walked past the news reporter seats and was surrounded for a long time. He gave instructions on how the reporters should write the news: "It's best to write comprehensively" and "Be cautious."</p>
<p>Representative Ren Zhuoyi, formerly the renowned Ye Qing, received applause and welcome from the audience due to his brilliant speech. Despite repeated ringing of the bell on the stage, he was allowed to continue speaking, indicating that he truly had the support of the people.</p>
<p>The afternoon session of the seventh assembly was chaired by Liu Hengjing, the only female chair. She wore a dark purple cheongsam, with a light brown wool coat, gold-rimmed glasses, and a loosely styled bun. She gracefully took her seat amidst applause, with the tall Lei Zhen to her right, creating a sharp contrast. After accepting the photographers' camera lenses, she used Cantonese-tinged Mandarin to preside over the meeting, ringing the bell with an imposing air.</p>
<p>Just as the meeting started, Zhang Daofan appeared, walked up to Shao Lizi, and bowed respectfully. Shao hurriedly returned the greeting, stood up, and let him go to a seat inside. Who knew that he had gone the wrong way, and came out again, sitting in the front row. Jiang Yiping said, "Regarding Mr. Sun Yat-sen, we don't believe in his teachings simply because he is the Father of the Nation, but because of his lofty political ideals that we respect him as the Father of the Nation. We hope that the Kuomintang, the Youth Party, and the Democratic Socialist Party can all agree that the assembly should impartially revise the constitution according to the principles of the Father of the Nation's political ideals, making it perfect."</p>
<p>Li Wenpu advocated for establishing the capital in Beiping, and said when discussing the climate reasons: "Beiping is suitable for work in all four seasons, but Nanjing is not. In the summer, it's almost one hundred degrees, too hot to work. Every year at this time, senior government officials go to Lushan to escape the heat, delaying government affairs is a small matter, but wasting the nation's treasury is a big matter. We, the National Assembly, represent the people, and we cannot allow the people's hard-earned money to be wasted like this." This caused enthusiastic applause.</p>
<p>Liu Guozeng demanded that the people's right to survival be included, believing that the Principle of People's Livelihood must be realized for the people to survive. He said: "The Communist Party can only cause trouble if the Kuomintang cannot implement the Principle of People's Livelihood. If the Kuomintang had truly implemented the Principle of People's Livelihood, the Communist Party would have been eliminated long ago. Now the country is in chaos, and the people are living in misery. Know that if the people cannot survive, all laws are nonsense."</p>
<p>Before the break, Chairman Liu announced: "Someone said that the air in the venue is too bad because there are too many people, and requested that the doors be opened. But I think the representatives sitting by the door must be cold. After one more speech, we'll take a break and open all the doors to change the air." So, after Qiu Jianyuan delivered a passionate speech on behalf of the peasants, everyone went out to change the air.</p>
<p>After the break, only one person spoke, and then they began reading written opinions one after another. Two announcers took turns reading until the adjournment, but very few people were listening.</p>
<p>At 5:45 PM, Deng Wenyi entered the venue from the front left side. He was handsome, his military uniform was crisp, and he sat down in the empty seat of Gan Naiguang at number 453 with a stride, chatting and laughing with Wang Junying at number 451 in the next seat (several Nanjing newspapers had reported that she had been publicly recognized by the assembly as the "Queen of the National Assembly") and Chen Yiyun and Rong Xi in the front row. The topic of discussion went on until the adjournment. (December 3)</p>

<h3>Communist Troops Launch Offensive, Juancheng Falls, Many Townships in Yuncheng in Danger, Northern Section of the Pinghan Railway in Intense Fighting, Sun Lianzhong Goes to the Front to Supervise</h3>
<p>[Our Jinan Dispatch, 3rd] Taking advantage of the National Army's cease-fire order, the Communist troops in Shandong Province have intensified their activities. The 13th Column of Liu Bocheng's forces and the 7th Column of Yang Mian's forces, totaling over 50,000, along with local militia, numbering around 100,000, launched an offensive against the National Army in southwestern Shandong on November 30th. The city of Juancheng was captured, and Jinxiang and Juancheng counties are also in critical condition. He Long's troops in northern Shandong have advanced from Cangxian to Dexian. Shandong convened a military and political meeting and decided to launch an effort to clear the Jinpu Railway, ordering the populace to organize stretcher-bearer units and "rescue squads," which is effectively the replenishment of troop strength. There have been no major changes in the eastern Shandong area recently.</p>
<p>[Our Xuzhou Dispatch, 2nd] The Communist troops in Shandong Province are actively preparing to launch a large-scale offensive, dividing the area into three regions, intending to concentrate their forces and attack. In Jiaodong, they will focus on Gaomi to cut off the Jiaoji Railway and restore the Jiaodong corridor. In central Shandong, they will target Zibo to capture the region; in northern Shandong, they will target Jinan.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 3rd] Communist troops concentrated four divisions in the northern section of the Pinghan Railway, south of Baoding, engaging in fierce battles with the National Army near Yujiazhuang. Sun Lianzhong personally went to the front yesterday to supervise the troops.</p>
<p>[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch, 3rd] Official News: (1) The Communist troops have recently been conscripting large numbers of civilians in the area west of Baitabu in Donghai, forcibly destroying the Haizhou Railway line, causing the populace to flee in distress. (2) The Communist troops have been carrying out massacres in the Xinan Township area, branding intellectuals, youths, and landlords as "Nationalist spies" and executing them.</p>
<p>[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch, 3rd] Siyang News: The Communist troops within Lianshui have suffered heavy blows after repeated interceptions by the National Army. It is reported that the remaining Communist troops in Lian, Shu, Yan, and Fu total approximately 10,000, but they are severely lacking in ammunition and food. Some Communist troops are poorly clothed, and the populace calls them "beggar soldiers." According to captured Communist troops, the Communist troops' grain reserves in Lian, Shu, Yan, and Fu can only last for two months. This offensive was launched in an attempt to seize grain and clothing to prolong their existence. If the National Army tightens the encirclement and blocks the sea outlet in northern Jiangsu, they will surely perish.</p>
<p>[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch, 3rd] Since the National Army cleared the Si-Huai Road and recovered Dingxi, north of Dongtai, the war in northern Jiangsu has become quiet. The National Army is now strengthening pacification efforts to consolidate the recovered rural areas, allowing returning civilians to cultivate the land in peace during the winter.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 3rd] Chief of Staff Guo Zongfen of the Commander-in-Chief's headquarters recently announced the situation of the Communist troops attacking the National Army in western Shanxi: The Communist troops launched a full-scale offensive towards Yonghe, Daning, Shilu, Puxian, and Wuxiang. Street fighting broke out in Gexian at 6:00 PM on the 28th of last month, and no further reports have been received since. The city walls of Puxian were breached on the 27th of last month, and the defending troops broke through on the morning of the 28th, establishing contact with the National Army in Linfen. The National Army in Shilu also retreated automatically due to the defeat in Yonghe and Gexian. Currently, Communist troops with a strength of 14,000 are attacking Jixian.</p>
<h3>Widespread Talk of Taking Over Dalian, Residents of Lushun and Dalian in Shenyang Prepare to Return Home, Staff Officer of the Andong Garrison Command Meets with Soviet Commander</h3>
<p>[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 3rd] There is much talk about the National Army's impending takeover of Dalian. Residents of Lushun and Dalian in Shenyang are preparing to return home, but the military authorities have avoided making any statements. According to a compilation of news from various sources, the National Army is currently advancing to the vicinity of Shihe. Shihe is located between Fuxian and Jinzhou, approximately 150 to 160 li from Dalian. Shihe is currently garrisoned by Soviet troops, which is the outer boundary of Dalian under the Sino-Soviet Treaty. How things will develop in the future remains to be seen.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 3rd] Gong Xuesui, the newly appointed mayor of Dalian, stated in a letter to friends from the Northeast that he is scheduled to go to the Northeast via Beiping at the end of this month, but there is no definite news about the takeover of Dalian.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Nanjing, 3rd] Today, military officials denied the rumor that the National Army had already entered the city of Dalian, but many believe that the National Army may enter the port within a week. Another report stated that the National Army, advancing south from Kaiping, 110 miles from Dalian, has reached a location nine miles from Dalian.</p>
<p>[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 3rd] At 10:00 AM on the 1st, Lei Kewen, the staff officer of the Andong Garrison Command, held talks with Colonel Kravov, the commander of the Soviet troops stationed in Sinuiju, in the middle of the Yalu River railway bridge. As a result, the 90-li Changdian River Estuary on the Andong side was officially handed over to our army by the Soviet troops at noon on the 2nd. A medium-sized motorboat from our side, which had sailed from Dadonggou to Andong, went missing in the Longyanpu area. Colonel K stated that the boat was detained by the Soviet army due to getting lost and will be returned in the coming days. Regarding the issue of Korean residents returning to their country, Colonel K said that he needs to consult before a decision can be made. The talks lasted for an hour and were extremely harmonious.</p>
<h3>French Reporter Reports on Dalian Today</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Changchun, 2nd] A French Agence France-Presse reporter, Jelson, recently telegraphed, stating that according to responsible sources, the Soviet troops in Dalian city withdrew in April of this year. Since then, there has been no trace of Soviet soldiers in Dalian city. This is a fact witnessed by everyone. The American consulate in Dalian has likely telegraphed this matter to the State Department, but outside rumors are rampant, claiming that the Soviet troops did not withdraw until November and handed over the Dalian city administration to the Chinese Communist Party. This statement is purely fictional, and the world should not believe it to be true. Since the end of April, the Soviet expatriates living in Dalian city have all been civilians, mostly civil servants of the Dalian city government. According to the Sino-Soviet Alliance Treaty signed in August 1945, the Dalian city administration is jointly governed by China and the Soviet Union. In the past seven months, although there have been no soldiers in Dalian city, there are still Soviet troops stationed outside the city. Therefore, in fact, Dalian city is still within the Soviet defense zone of Lushun. According to this Soviet defense zone, it extends 30 miles northeast to Dalian city, almost cutting the south of the former Japanese-leased Kwantung territory. According to the Sino-Soviet Treaty, Dalian is a free port and no troops may be stationed there. Therefore, in Dalian city, except for the police, there are no troops stationed. Furthermore, due to this regulation, it is impossible for the National Army to enter Dalian city. This is because if the National Army enters Dalian city by land, it will inevitably clash with the Soviet troops. According to General Du Yuming's statement a few days ago, the National Army will not use force to take over Dalian. The National Army has been waiting outside the Soviet defense zone for more than a month. In addition, it is said that the Dalian city government was elected by the local people. Although not 100% Communist Party members, the Communist Party's influence is very strong.</p>
<h3>National Army in the Northeast Recovers Changling</h3>
<p>[Our Changchun Dispatch, 3rd] A certain unit of the National Army recovered Changling (approximately 400 li east of Changchun) at 2:00 PM on November 30th.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Beiping, 3rd] Lin Biao, the commander-in-chief of the Communist troops in the Northeast, has been gradually expanding his offensive. His troops have attacked the National Army's positions south of the Songhua River between Harbin and Changchun.</p>
<h3>Rumor that Fu Zuoyi has Arrived in Beiping</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 3rd] Fu Zuoyi flew from Nanjing to Beiping at 2:00 PM this afternoon. It is rumored that Fu originally planned to return directly to Zhangjiakou from Nanjing, but due to military issues, he needed to consult with the Eleventh War Zone, so he stayed in Beiping for one night. Regarding the personnel details of the reorganization of the provincial governments of Chahar and Suiyuan, Fu has discussed them with the central government during this trip to Nanjing and will be announced soon.</p>
<h3>Communist Troops Plant Landmines to Disrupt Transportation, Train on the Beining Railway Destroyed, Train Conductor Stabbed, Passengers and Staff Kidnapped</h3>
<p>[Our Tianjin Dispatch, 3rd] On the night of the 2nd, a train between Beidaihe and Liushouying on the Beining Railway hit a landmine planted by the Communist troops. Five cars were destroyed, and twelve cars were derailed. The Communist troops along the railway immediately broke into the train and looted it extensively. The train conductor was stabbed, and the staff and passengers on the train were kidnapped. Their whereabouts are still unknown. Traffic on the Pingjin line will be interrupted for a day or two.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 3rd] The Xin-Bing section of the Tongpu Northern Line has been repaired and is now open to traffic. The Southern Line is being repaired southward from Yitang and has crossed the two rivers to one kilometer north of Lingshi.</p>
<h3>Li Shouxin Renames Himself Zizhong, His Troops Have Been Transferred to Northern Rehe</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 3rd] After Li Shouxin was appointed as the Commander-in-Chief of the Rehe People's Self-Defense Army, he has been transferred to Kaiping in northern Rehe. His task from now on is to expand local armed forces and assist the National Army in pacifying Rehe. However, the province's local troops, which originally had five battalions, are now planning to expand to ten battalions. Li has changed his name to Zizhong. The power generation facilities in Rehe Province have not yet been restored.</p>
<h3>A Record of an Inspection of the Blockhouse Lines in Northern Shaanxi, No National Army within Hundreds of Li of Yijun and Other Counties, Most of the People's Self-Defense Forces Disbanded by Communist Troops</h3>
<p>[Our Xi'an Dispatch, 3rd] After inspecting the blockhouse line areas in Yijun, Tongguan, Yaoxian, and Chunhua counties in northern Shaanxi, our reporter returned to Xi'an. There is not a single National Army soldier within hundreds of li of the blockhouse lines. All of them were the last to withdraw during the ceasefire. The People's Self-Defense Forces of various counties who took over the blockhouse lines have inferior weapons and most have been disbanded by the Communist troops. The counties close to the border areas, which previously had their taxes waived due to the people's hardships, have been decided to be restored next year. The people have expressed dissatisfaction with this. In the Yihuang area from Huangling to Xunyi over the last half month, the Communist troops have amassed large forces. As of now, there are the Red 6th Regiment and the Red 8th Regiment of the Police 1st Brigade, the 516th Regiment and 177th Regiment of the New 4th Brigade, the Provisional 2nd Brigade and 3rd Brigade of the New 4th Army, and the Police 3rd Regiment. Their regular activities include murdering Baojia personnel, seizing weapons, and taking away livestock, carts, grain, materials, and supplies. There has been a slight lull recently, but the situation is still tense. In the area east of the Xianyu Highway, which was originally not part of the border area, multiple groups of unidentified armed forces have gathered. When our reporter left Tongguan the day before yesterday, the town of Hongtu, 30 li east of the city, was captured, the town chief was killed, and livestock and supplies were taken away. They frequently enter and exit the area around Huangling County, and the situation in Huangyi is more serious. The border line between the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia border area seems to be in a state of uncertainty. The National Army along the Xianyu Highway constantly sends letters to persuade the Communist troops not to approach the county towns, otherwise they will be shot. Since the victory, the number of National Army troops in northern Shaanxi has decreased significantly. Currently, only a small number of National Army troops are stationed in each county. On the Xianyu Highway and various rural roads, our reporter only encountered two empty trucks heading north during ten days in Tongguan. The road was desolate, and the cold dust obscured the sun, with only mule caravans for company. Overall, in terms of the military situation, the Communist troops can break through the defense line and advance south at any time. The small number of National Army troops stationed there greatly surprised our reporter.</p>
<h3>Such a "Liberation" Movement</h3>
<p>Shaanxi Communists Force Churches to Hand Over Church Property</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 3rd] The Communist Party has recently been vigorously carrying out the "liberation" movement in the Sanbian area of northern Shaanxi, forcing Catholic churches in Weizi Liangshan Bridge, Baini Well, Heilang Bay, and other places to hand over church property, and also demanding the collection of rent grain from the churches since 1935. Belgian and Chinese priests Mei Jiding, Sha Zhilin, Gong Dehua, and others fled one after another due to unbearable oppression. Some were detained by Communist troops in Sanbian and suffered severe abuse. In addition to instructing various counties to rescue them, the Shaanxi Provincial Government has also ordered the Department of Social Affairs to allocate funds for relief.</p>
<h3>American Bishop Cai Fasi Subjected to "Liquidation" and Interrogation</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 3rd] Robert P. Post of the New York Times reported yesterday from Xuzhou on the Chinese Communist Party's abuse of Bishop Cai Fasi of the Catholic Church in Daming. It is reported that the 53-year-old bishop was expelled and came to Xuzhou after the CCP occupied Daming. Cai Fasi was subjected to liquidation and interrogation. During the CCP's interrogation, after being beaten, he was convicted and fined 30 tons of grain and 47 million yuan (wartime currency). When Bishop Cai stated that he was unable to pay the fine, the Communist Party confiscated the church and all its furniture and livestock and confiscated 33 acres of land. The bishop also said that the Communists also abused Christians. Bishop Cai has gone to Shanghai to heal the wounds he sustained during the interrogation.</p>
<h3>Implementation Measures for Cooperative Enterprises in Pacification Zones Have Been Announced</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 3rd] The implementation measures for cooperative enterprises in pacification zones have been formulated, announced, and implemented. The purpose is to improve the basic social and economic organization and develop the people's livelihood economy. In principle, a cooperative organization in the pacification zone should be established in each county town and each township, and a joint cooperative should be established in each county.</p>
<h3>The Darkness Within the Chinese Communist Party is Fully Exposed in the "Instructions on Mass Movement," Admitting that the Work of Rent Reduction and Interest Reduction is Still Extremely Unbalanced</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Baoding, 3rd] The key document of the Communist Party, "Instructions on the Universal Mass Movement in the Jin-Sui Border Region," obtained from relevant sources, is over 5,000 words long. Its content is sufficient to expose the darkness within the Communist Party, no different from a self-confession.</p>
<p>Regarding the so-called mass movement in the Jin-Sui border region, the document says that there are many shortcomings. From a regional perspective, the work of rent reduction and interest reduction is still extremely unbalanced. The masses have not yet been mobilized. The cadres have the opportunistic idea of working to write reports to their superiors.</p>
<p>"In terms of work and policy control," the document says: Our shortcomings and errors are even more serious. All work does not start from the urgent demands of the masses at the time and place, but is instead replaced by doing everything for them and forced orders. It also says: The policy of rent reduction and interest reduction, from the district to the county, from the county to the district, and even to the heads of village cadres, is that if there is no landlord, they will fight the rich peasant, if there is no rich peasant, they will fight the middle peasant, and some even reach out to the poor peasant, unlimited rent refunds and clearing of old debts; some even cleared up to the Guangxu period, and the clearing of debts was changed to clearing up the account books, and some even brought out the ancestral tablets of three generations, so not only did they not mobilize the masses, but they greatly suppressed the production enthusiasm of the masses. Of course, rich peasants want to reduce production, and even the poor laborers who have turned over and bought land dare not produce boldly, fearing that they will be fought if they plant too much land. The masses believe that "in this era, it is enough to get by and not die." They think that whoever has it will be fought, pouring cold water on the masses. This is leadership bureaucracy.</p>
<h3>A Staff Member of the Hebei Provincial Government Commits Suicide by Drinking Blue Ink</h3>
<p>Life Difficulties Lead to Short-Sightedness</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Baoding, 3rd] Tian Zemin, a staff member of the First Section of the Secretariat of the Hebei Provincial Government, due to soaring prices, difficult living conditions, and the impending birth of his wife, whose monthly salary was not enough for ten days' use, suddenly had a short-sighted idea at his home on the evening of the 2nd, drinking twelve bottles of blue ink and stabbing his navel with a steel pen in an attempt to commit suicide. Fortunately, he was discovered early and sent to the provincial hospital for treatment, and his life is no longer in danger.</p>
<h3>United States to Send a Second Batch of Experts to China to Study Agriculture, Zou Bingwen to Attend Food Conference in the United States</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 2nd] The Sino-American Agricultural Study Group has just completed its mission, and the United States is about to send a second study group to China. Its members are all experts in the use of agricultural machinery. The leader of the group is Davidson, the director of the Department of Agricultural Engineering at Iowa State University. The members include agricultural machinery expert Stone, farm construction expert Hansen, and farmland irrigation expert Macaulay. This study is intended to stay in China for three years, and its expenses are subsidized by an agreement between the International Farm Products Company and the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry of the Nanjing Government. The International Farm Products Company has also established 20 agricultural science scholarships to subsidize Chinese students studying at graduate schools in the United States.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taipei, 3rd] Zou Bingwen, chairman of the Chinese Agricultural Society, flew from Taiwan to Shanghai this afternoon and will soon travel from Shanghai to the United States to attend the fifth executive committee meeting of the United Nations Food Conference to be held in the United States on December 16. Zou was previously elected as an executive committee member and vice chairman at the United Nations Food Conference.</p>
<h3>Negotiations on the Haiphong Incident Yield No Results, Tension Remains in Hanoi, French Commissioner to Vietnam Says He is Quite Satisfied with Sino-French Relations</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hanoi, 2nd] Although the Battle of Haiphong has ended, relations between France and Vietnam have not improved in any way. In Hanoi, the atmosphere is very tense because the French and Vietnamese sides have been unable to reach an agreement on resolving the Haiphong incident. The Vietnamese and French newspapers here continue to accuse each other. The Vietnamese government has ordered the people to evacuate the city to prevent any eventuality, and some Vietnamese government agencies have also been moved out. The Vietnamese Propaganda Department issued a statement announcing the negotiations between France and Vietnam to resolve the Haiphong incident, stating that the negotiations have not yet yielded results.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 1st] French High Commissioner to Vietnam, Vice Admiral d'Argenlieu, recently stated in an interview with the "Climate" magazine that relations between China and France are quite satisfactory. We are currently implementing the economic agreement recently signed between China and France. Regarding the withdrawal of Chinese troops from Vietnam, it was not easy, and much of the credit should be given to President Chiang's political wisdom. President Chiang was successful in overcoming the local troops' egoism and the imperialism of some military leaders, which is commendable.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Hanoi, 2nd] Officials recently announced that a special delegation from the Vietnamese Viet Minh government departed for Siam today. Vietnamese expatriates in Siam gathered to welcome the delegation and held a demonstration, passing the following resolutions: (1) Fully support President Ho Chi Minh of the Viet Minh government; (2) Continue to fight for Vietnam's independence and territorial integrity; (3) Oppose France's implementation of terrorism in southern Vietnam and southern Annam and its willful provocation in Tonkin; (4) Strive for the implementation of the Franco-Vietnamese Provisional Agreement by all possible means.</p>

<h3>Stark Contrast in Qingdao: Citizens' Lives are Difficult, Receiving Personnel are Licentious; Bandit Traces are Seen from Time to Time in the Suburbs; Martial Law on the Sea Starting from the 5th</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Qingdao, 3rd] Qingdao, a summer resort of victory, is gradually becoming deserted in winter. There are only a little over a thousand U.S. Navy personnel stationed here now. Prices are high, exceeding those in Shanghai. The business community is generally depressed. Strikes have occurred in recent days. The hardship of the general public's life contrasts sharply with the licentiousness of the receiving personnel. Bandit traces are seen from time to time dozens of miles outside the city. The garrison headquarters announced that martial law will be imposed on the sea from 5:00 PM to 6:00 AM the next morning, starting from the 5th, prohibiting civilian ships from entering and exiting.</p>

<h3>Tianjin Stallholders Stop Business to Protest the City Government's Order to Relocate</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Tianjin, 3rd] The vegetable market in the former French Concession of Tianjin is a concentrated area for stallholders. Since the influx of American goods here, the number of stallholders has increased daily, and it is extremely lively. Recently, the city government, considering the area to be the traffic center of the city and the presence of many stalls obstructs traffic, negotiated with the municipal Chamber of Commerce and decided to select Zhang Zizhong Road as the stallholders' trading area, ordering them to relocate. Upon hearing this, the stallholders, believing that losses would be huge if they relocated near the end of the year, formed a kneeling petition group and went to the Municipal Government Police Bureau to petition for a postponement of the relocation. The city government stated that the order could not be withdrawn and must be enforced, resulting in the issue becoming serious due to the stalemate. The Chamber of Commerce and local gentry are currently trying to persuade them to withdraw, but all the stallholders have automatically stopped trading to show their protest.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Rumor of an Anglo-American Alliance</h3>
<p>The London "Daily Worker" reported on the 1st that Britain will soon conclude a military alliance treaty with the United States. Once Alexander takes office as Minister of Defense, this treaty will be implemented. Although this shocking news has been denied by the British Army, we cannot but pay considerable attention to the origin of this rumor. Especially in these days when the United Nations General Assembly is discussing the investigation of foreign troops in various countries, the overall reduction of armaments, and the survival of the veto power, the waves on the Lake of Success are rising one after another, which truly makes us worry about the future of the world.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Branch of the National Foreign Affairs Association held a symposium on "The International Situation and China," reviewing the evolution of the world situation and our country's diplomatic way out. All the international affairs experts who participated in the symposium believed that today's world has reached a crossroads. One road leads to "one world," as long as Britain and the Soviet Union, together with all other peace-loving countries, cooperate closely to restore the wartime spirit of unity and cooperation to create world peace, they will be able to make the post-war world enter the ideal realm of "one world." The other road leads to "two worlds." Observing the political trends of various countries since the end of World War II, it is clear that the opposition between Britain and the United States and the Soviet Union has the possibility of splitting today's world into "two worlds." In the situation of opposition between these two worlds, there can be no peace in the world. All peace-loving countries do not want to see the reality of "two worlds." However, the rumor of an Anglo-American alliance can indeed increase our worries about Britain and the United States going their separate ways. Compared to this, we have to pay close attention.</p>
<p>Since the end of World War II, the work of creating peace has been continuously carried out through the efforts of politicians and diplomats of various countries. In this year and four months, the international community has held numerous foreign ministers' meetings, Paris conferences, and United Nations General Assemblies. However, true peace has not only not yet come to the world, but also this world is moving further and further away from the "gate of peace," which makes everyone feel disappointed. Looking at the situation of the United Nations General Assembly these days, one cannot but think that the great powers' diplomats are "joking" there. The world is now standing at a crossroads, which road will it take? Under the turbulent waves of the Lake of Success, the future of the world feels even more uncertain. Hearing the rumor that Britain and the United States will form an alliance naturally gives rise to a sense of "bewilderment."</p>
<p>An Anglo-American alliance is not surprising from a racial, political, economic, military, or historical point of view. Britain and the United States are both Anglo-Saxon nations, with the same blood and language, and similar customs and habits. They are fundamentally two countries that cannot be separated. Moreover, in both the First and Second World Wars, the United States spared no cost to stand on Britain's side and participate in the war, both achieving glorious victories. Therefore, in fact, there has long been a kind of "unwritten treaty" between Britain and the United States. Assuming a new war unfortunately breaks out, even if Britain and the United States do not conclude a treaty, the United States will inevitably still stand on Britain's side. But why are people so alarmed when they hear the rumor that Britain and the United States will form an alliance? This is because the people of all countries in the world, after the war, have learned from the pain and believe that the great powers should unite rather than separate. On the current international stage, the opposition between Britain and the United States and the Soviet Union is already very obvious and seems inevitable. However, political and diplomatic efforts in various countries are still making every effort to achieve international understanding and cooperation, and it cannot be considered that hope has been completely lost. Moreover, everyone knows that if Britain and the Soviet Union cannot cooperate, there is no hope for peace in Europe; similarly, if Britain and the United States and the Soviet Union cannot cooperate, there will be no peace in the world. The United Nations General Assembly is currently meeting on the shores of the Lake of Success. How to eliminate suspicions between countries and all the shadows in the international community, so as not to split into "two worlds," but to promote the realization of "one world," all peace-loving and peace-desiring people in various countries have consistent and great expectations. Especially hope that the United Nations General Assembly can complete its mission in a friendly atmosphere. Now, the rumor of an Anglo-American alliance is spreading internationally, which is really extremely unfavorable news for the United Nations General Assembly.</p>
<p>I remember that former British Prime Minister Churchill, within this year, repeatedly made remarks. Once, in a speech in Fulton, USA, he advocated Anglo-American cooperation. Another time in France, he advocated an Anglo-French alliance; and another time in Switzerland, he advocated Franco-German cooperation. All of these made people suspect that people like Churchill were trying to organize a Western group to confront the Soviet Union, insisting on dividing "one world" into "two worlds." Our country hopes that the post-war world will step into a new era of peace and democracy, and we cannot agree with any proposition that will split the world and form a confrontational group. This newspaper has also repeatedly commented on this, and all believe that it is inappropriate. Therefore, we do not believe in the rumor of an Anglo-American alliance. Although the diplomatic policy adopted by the British Labor Party government has maintained the style of the Conservative Party, it will not lightly engage in diplomatic actions that are enough to cause a sense of division in the world. What's more, recently some Labor Party members have expressed dissatisfaction with the current diplomatic policy and submitted amendments to the House of Commons, advocating a transcendent and independent policy, demanding that the government adopt a policy that "opposes Soviet communism while opposing American imperialism." Although it was rejected by the House of Commons, in any case, this move is still a warning to the Labor Party government, making it have to be more cautious about the diplomatic measures it will often take in the future.</p>
<h3>Prospects for the Anglo-Indian Conference</h3>
<p>British Governor-General of India Wavell, along with Indian Interim Government Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Nehru, Muslim League Chairman Jinnah, Finance Minister Ali Khan, and Defense Minister Baldev Singh, flew to Britain on the same plane and have arrived in London. The Anglo-Indian Round Table Conference is about to open, and the British Cabinet has also decided on the agenda of the meeting. This is the first joint meeting of the British, Indian, and Muslim sides since the Calcutta Massacre on August 16. The venue is far away in London, which can avoid the direct impulse of public emotions, and representatives from the three sides can use a more calm mind to deal with this complex and urgent problem.</p>
<p>It was not easy to convene this meeting successfully. When Nehru formed the interim government on September 2 under Wavell's invitation, Muslim League Chairman Jinnah not only refused to participate, but also instructed all Indian Muslims to hang black flags on the day the new government was established to show resistance, resulting in continued violent clashes. Later, on October 3, Jinnah met with Wavell and his attitude suddenly changed, resolutely deciding to participate in the new government. However, Jinnah suddenly expressed opposition to the Constituent Assembly meeting scheduled to be convened on December 9. Wavell contacted Jinnah and decided to convene this London 　　conference. Jinnah agreed, and Nehru expressed his unwillingness to attend because he was afraid of delaying the convening of the Constituent Assembly. Later, Prime Minister Attlee was willing to guarantee the success of the Indian Constituent Assembly, and Nehru agreed to return.</p>
<p>From the above series of facts, we can know that this London Round Table Conference has three fundamental issues: first, the future status of Muslims in the Indian government; second, to what extent can Nehru concede to the Muslims? Third, whether the British government allows India to be truly independent.</p>
<p>Muslims cannot compete with Indians in elections because their population is less than 100 million, accounting for a quarter of the total Indian population. What Muslims are now striving for is Pakistan, that is, the separation of India and Pakistan, with Muslims forming Pakistan independently, or Muslims can occupy more positions in the Indian government to avoid any unfavorable measures taken by Indians relying on the majority. Jinnah initially refused to participate in the interim government, and now he is unwilling to participate in the Constituent Assembly for this motive. However, on Nehru's side, he feels that he has made sufficient concessions to the Muslim League. Muslims occupy six seats in the interim government. In the future, the Constituent Assembly can also specially stipulate in the constitution for Muslims so that Muslims do not feel oppressed. Now the Muslim League is fundamentally unwilling to participate in the Constituent Assembly, and its attitude is too tough. Therefore, Nehru criticized the Muslim League leaders for having a fascist style, and the reason for this is also this.</p>
<p>In addition to the conflict between India and Muslims, the most important thing is the attitude of the British government. After the First World War, Britain broke its promise to allow India to be independent. After the Second World War, the national movements in various colonies rose one after another, and the British government felt that it could not completely adopt a policy of military suppression. For India, only by letting her be independent can it still gain the favor of the Indians, and it can retain important rights in military and economic aspects. Therefore, Britain's permission for India to be independent is not willing, but is compelled by the situation. If there is an opportunity to control it for one more day, she will still try her best to maintain the old forces. 、</p>
<p>The internal conflict between India and Muslims is a fatal wound to the future of Indian independence. Because if India and Muslims are united, the British government has little to do. The Indians can train their own national defense forces according to Nehru's proposal and ask the British army to return to their country. In terms of commerce, cooperate with the United States and the Soviet Union and not allow the British to monopolize. India's true freedom and independence can be easily achieved, but the non-cooperation between India and Muslims allows the British government to take the opportunity to use divisive tactics. At the time of the formation of the interim government, Jinnah attacked the British government and Nehru for cooperating and oppressing Muslims. Now Jinnah had a discussion with Wavell and immediately joined the new government. This time there is another London conference. In the eyes of Nehru and the Indians, the British government and the Muslim League cannot avoid the suspicion of collusion. Therefore, Nehru told reporters from the United Press in Cairo: "If the British army withdraws from India, the National Congress Party and the Muslim League will reach an agreement, which will be easier."</p>
<p>We want to advise the Indian and Muslim races to be independent and autonomous and not to be fooled by others. The freedom and independence of all India cannot be built on internal struggles, let alone on the support of others. Only unity can generate strength, and only peace can build the country. At the same time, we also hope that the British Labor Party government will abandon outdated colonialism and the policy of balanced power and "divide and rule" of President 　. In today's era of 　　ethnic awareness development, power and fraud can no longer be used as good tools to maintain the British Empire. The British 　 government's vision should focus on the future. In case there are international disputes in the future, whether the 350 million Indians will be friends or enemies of the British depends on what attitude the British government decides to take in this London Round Table Conference. Therefore, we sincerely hope that after this Round Table Conference attended by the British, Indian, and Muslim parties, an agreement can be reached, so that the Constituent Assembly convened on the 9th of this month can be opened as scheduled.</p>

<h3>Thirteen Robbers Escape from Suzhou Prison: Using Foreign Lead Sheet as a Sharp Tool to Dig Holes and Break Through Walls; Only Two Captured in the Dark Night</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Suzhou, 3rd] Around 3:00 AM on the 3rd, the Suzhou County Local Court Guard House suddenly discovered that inmates Yuan Dahua, Huang Yonglin, Wang Xiangsheng, Ma Shijie, Hu Xiaoquan, Song Wanxin, Zhong Rongsheng, Huang Zhenhua, Zhu Daguozi, Zhou A'er, Wu Genmu, Wu Linquan, and opium addict Fan Gensheng, a total of thirteen prisoners, had committed a major jailbreak and fled. Court President Wang Yu immediately ordered all bailiffs and guards to mobilize, guarding all city gates, and captured two robber prisoners, Wu Genmu and Wu Linquan. At dawn, President Wang, accompanied by Chief Prosecutor Kan Yue, led Warden Yin Zaicheng to report to the Suzhou High Court and requested punishment. The two heads of the High Court were on a tour of northern Jiangsu, so Zhang Qi'e, the acting director of the First Criminal Tribunal, dispatched two clerks, Mao Yuyu and Ji Yudong, to rush to the scene of the incident to investigate. It was found that the inmates Yuan Dahua, etc., had secretly gone to the side of the room wall from the gap under the wooden bed board, dug a tunnel with a foreign lead sheet, passed through the passage outside the room that only allowed people to walk, and reached the surrounding wall, and then broke through the hole to escape, so that the patrols and guards did not notice. It was not until there was no one in the room that it was discovered. Because it was dark at the time, it was easy to hide, so in addition to the two prisoners who were captured, the rest escaped. The police are now searching in all directions and intensifying the pursuit. Our reporter made a special trip to visit President Wang to inquire about his views on this incident. He was pleased to make the following remarks: The responsible department is undoubtedly to blame for the responsibility issue in this case, and the court and prosecutor's office also have shortcomings in supervision. However, to go a step further, the construction of the court's guard house is difficult to be strong due to limited funds, and it accommodates more than 400 inmates, while the entire guard has only 20 people, and supervision is also difficult to be thorough. In order to enhance the vigilance of my subordinates, I often go to inspect it personally before going to bed every night. When I went to see it at 7:00 PM on the 2nd night, I still did not feel any signs. It is true that the room is narrow and crowded, and it is not easy to detect one or two people missing by digging secretly under the bed board. Moreover, it was a tunnel escape, which was beyond expectations, so the lack of financial and human resources is also one of the reasons for the formation of this case. Now, in addition to trying my best to arrest them, I often wait for President Sun and Chief Han of the High Court to return to Suzhou to decide on the disposal method. The reporter then inquired about the sentencing situation of the fugitives, and he replied that most of them were still in the investigation or trial process, only a few had been sentenced, and the most severe sentence was twenty years. However, these people are all habitual thieves and have special skills in excavation.</p>
<h3>Under the Principle of Not Obstructing Traffic, Suzhou and Hangzhou Concede to Allow Stalls; Hangzhou Police Chief Restrains His Subordinates to Cherish Themselves</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Suzhou News] The Suzhou City Defense Headquarters previously ordered the police bureau to ban stallholders in the Guanqian Street area in order to rectify the city appearance, and designated the sidewalk behind the Guohuo Company of the North Bureau and the Xinshi Market at the First Tianmen as concentrated business locations for stallholders. However, the stallholders believed that the above two places were remote and sparsely populated, and their livelihood was bleak, and it was bound to be difficult to maintain a livelihood. Therefore, they formed a "Stallholders Friendship Association" and gathered more than 300 stallholders in Yuemiao Temple to discuss response measures, and decided to petition the authorities. At that time, the police bureau was afraid of accidents, so it sent many policemen to maintain order. Now the City Defense Headquarters has approved the change of the ban method, stipulating that although stallholders are still not allowed to set up stalls on the sidewalk of Guanqian Street, stallholders are allowed to set up stalls in the alleys (lanes) and shops in the Guanqian area, under the principle of not obstructing traffic. The method is softened, and all the stallholders have expressed their agreement to accept it.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Hangzhou News] When the Hangzhou Police Bureau held a memorial week at 8:00 AM on the 2nd, Chief Shen Pu instructed each branch bureau to pay attention to three things: (1) The ban on stallholders in Shanghai caused a great disturbance. This city has made considerable achievements in this work. In the future, when performing duties, if the stallholders do not obstruct traffic order, their livelihood must be taken into account and they are allowed to set up stalls. (2) Each branch bureau and supervisor should strictly review their subordinates, cherish themselves, and avoid causing trouble. (3) For the convenience of management, the security police stationed in various agencies and banks will be re-divided from this month.</p>

<h3>Financial Difficulties in Anhui Province Counties; District Meetings Convened for Balancing</h3>
<p>[Our Hefei Report] Anhui Province's provincial finances are severely deficient, and county-level finances are even more difficult. According to repeated talks with county magistrates who have come to the province, the meager salaries and subsidies of county-level staff and primary school teachers are often delayed by two or three months before they can be paid. Moreover, the deficits made up by misappropriation are often rejected by the County Council during review. To solve the county-level difficulties, the Finance Department has obtained approval from the provincial government to send personnel to Bengbu, Wuhu, and Anqing in early December to convene county-level financial balancing meetings, to discuss the reorganization of taxation, the clearing of public school property, and ways to increase revenue and reduce expenditure. The Bengbu meeting is scheduled for December 5th to 7th, the Wuhu meeting for December 25th to 27th, and the Anqing meeting for December 20th to 22nd. Orders have been telegraphed to the commissioners of the ten districts throughout the province, county and city mayors, and heads of financial institutions to arrive at the designated meeting locations in advance to attend. It is reported that Director of Finance Pu Mengjiu will also rush to preside over the meetings in turn.</p>
<h3>Current Financial Situation in Anhui Province</h3>
<p>[Our Hefei Report] The revenue and expenditure of Anhui Province have always been unbalanced. Since the implementation of the central, provincial (city), and county (city) three-level system in July of this year, the province's share of the agricultural tax (or land tax) at 20% and the business tax at 50% is too small. It is estimated that the total income for the second half of the year may not exceed 3 to 4 billion yuan, while the expenditure will reach 10 billion yuan, a huge discrepancy. It was originally planned that the shortfall for July, August, and September would be subsidized by the central government, but due to the shortage of income, the three months of October, November, and December still require central government subsidies. Since July of this year, county-level finances have been operating according to the "new fiscal system." In addition to the original statutory taxes and levies, an additional 50% of the agricultural tax (or land tax) and business tax has been allocated, and all of the deed tax goes to the county. Their income is more abundant than before. However, since the counties are autonomous units, the expenses required for the development of various self-reliant undertakings are very large. Counting the second half of this year, the expenditure of all counties in the province is about 30 billion yuan, while the income is only over 10 billion yuan, a large disparity between revenue and expenditure. Therefore, the financial situation of both the province and the counties is currently in deficit. The Department of Finance is closely planning how to increase revenue and reduce expenditure in the province. The takeover of various provincial and county taxes by the county collection agencies has been completed. The names of the agencies have been designated as "Tax Collection Bureaus" to distinguish them from the original county "Tax Collection Offices." They are divided into five grades, depending on the amount of annual collection, and the number of personnel employed is also proportional to the grade. Director of Finance Pu Mengjiu is extremely cautious about the selection of heads of the tax collection bureaus, and the principles of appointment are divided into four types: (1) The original directors of the tax collection offices who have achieved outstanding results will be reappointed. (2) Those who were originally transferred from the central tax bureaus to the provincial level and have excellent performance will be retained as appropriate. (3) Those who have previously engaged in financial work, have rich experience, and have achieved excellent results will be appointed. (4) Those recommended by various parties will be selected and appointed. Separate appointment and reward and punishment measures have been formulated to bring the province's tax administration into order.</p>
<h3>Strange Disease on the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway Line; Diarrhea and Bloated Abdomen Lead to Death; Many Students in Mudu Infected</h3>
<p>[Our City Report] Zhang Bingrui, Deputy Director of the Executive Yuan Health Affairs Committee, recently returned from inspecting health conditions in various parts of Jiangsu Province. According to his report: "A strange disease has recently been discovered along the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway line, prevalent near Mudu in Suzhou, called the 'Blood-Sucking Disease.' Patients first experience diarrhea, followed by swelling of the spleen and abdomen, eventually leading to death. According to investigations, up to 25% of primary school students in Mudu are infected with this disease. The Jiangsu Provincial Health Department and the Central Health Laboratory have recently established clinics in Mudu to prevent its spread. As for the treatment of the Blood-Sucking Disease, there are effective drugs available abroad, and the Executive Yuan is urging the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration to purchase them. Recently, a new disease has been discovered in Jiangbei, a type of yaws, prevalent in the Huaiyin area, a skin disease transmitted by the Japanese army from the South Pacific during the war, which is easier to treat." Zhang also recounted the recent health situation in various places along the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway line, saying that hospitals in Zhenjiang, Suzhou, Changzhou, and Wuxi are actively repairing buildings and reorganizing internally, and are expected to return to normal before the end of the year. The Executive Yuan will supply the hospitals with medical equipment to improve the health conditions in various places.</p>

<p>Hope for Improvement in Coffin Transportation Methods</p>
<p>First Letter Since the news spread that the Municipal Health Bureau will clear accumulated coffins in the urban area, coffin families have not been without feeling anxious. According to reports, there are as many as 100,000 accumulated coffins in this city, a number that is shocking. The reason for reaching this huge number is nothing more than that since the eight years of the War of Resistance, there have been many people living in this city who have been unable to return to their hometowns. When family members died, arranging coffins was already difficult, let alone having the spare capacity to purchase land for burial. In addition, the suburbs are unsettled, and transportation is blocked. Even if they have the heart to escort the coffins back to their hometowns, the environment does not allow it. Moreover, many coffin families are travelers whose hometowns cannot be reached quickly. At this time of material hardship, it is not easy for them to immediately raise large sums of money to arrange transportation. From this, it can be seen that those who have kept coffins for a long time without transporting them have their own unavoidable difficulties.</p>
<p>The nature of our people is simple and honest, and many still adhere to traditional concepts such as burying ancestors in their ancestral tombs and burying parents together. Although the authorities have allowed a grace period of three months, can coffin families fully handle it as scheduled? Otherwise, when the deadline expires in the blink of an eye, and the authorities incinerate them as unclaimed coffins, it seems that they have not deeply sympathized with their desire to enshrine them and the Chinese old etiquette of filial piety, which is regrettable.</p>
<p>The health authorities place emphasis on the fact that such a large number of coffins are stored in a place where millions of people gather, and for the health of the citizens, it is appropriate to thoroughly remove them. They have already considered it for the coffin families and extended the deadline to March of next year, which cannot be said to be inconsiderate. Those coffin families who can afford it should carry it out as soon as possible, on the one hand, to obey the law, and on the other hand, to fulfill their own obligations, and they must not continue to procrastinate and bring trouble on themselves. However, for those coffin families with weak ability, where the economy is already difficult, or where transportation is inconvenient, or where their hometowns are still occupied by soldiers and bandits and it is not easy to handle, it seems that the authorities should be asked to extend the deadline further. Can it be approved that within the original extended deadline, the coffins stored in the funeral parlors and coffin storage places in the central area of this city be gradually cleared first, and then the coffins stored in the coffin storage places and mortuaries in the border areas of this city be removed in the second step, in order to complete the entire plan within one year? Then the coffin families can have the opportunity to wait for the situation to become more stable and facilitate transportation, and they can also plan a considerable amount of money to cover transportation costs, benefiting both the public and private sectors. These are humble opinions, and it is still hoped that the authorities will adopt them. (Wang Mu**)</p>
<p>Second Letter My friend is from Hankou, and his mother-in-law died in Shanghai and is buried in the Huxi Funeral Parlor. Recently, I heard that the Municipal Health Bureau announced that it advocates transporting them back to their hometowns. After finding a guarantor and applying for a passport at the police station, obtaining a quarantine certificate from the quarantine station, and declaring it at customs, following the regulations of the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, the procedures were completed, and the lucky bill of lading was also obtained. Then the coffin truck was shipped to the wharf, but unexpectedly, the problem came again. The porters at the dock asked for an exorbitant price, requiring 100,000 yuan in national currency to carry it onto the ship, and another 100,000 yuan to carry it into the ship. The managers also have to spend money, and they cannot hire other workers to carry it themselves, which is both tyrannical and unreasonable. The authorities turned a blind eye. Such a troublesome and costly affair. The municipality's plan to clear accumulated coffins by the end of this year, I guess: will again be hindered by the facts and cannot be implemented, because most of the poor and miserable people cannot afford it, so they have to watch as they are cremated. Now I come up with an extra request to the municipal government, can the above troublesome procedures be reformed and simplified a bit? Since the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company is state-run, there should be a strict way to stop these porters from extorting them indiscriminately, and try to improve it. I hope that the responsible persons in the relevant authorities will seek more benefits for the people, so that the municipal government's plan may be realized! (Xiao She)</p>
<h3>Call for Attention to Public Security in Nanshi</h3>
<p>Taosha Yard Street, Shizi Street, and Sanpailou Street in Nanshi are all thoroughfares that run through the northern half of the city, and are also the only routes for residents in the city center to return from north to south. However, in addition to the fact that the above-mentioned places have been rugged and in disrepair for many years, there are no street lights installed, and after dark, it is so dark that you cannot see your fingers. As the winter defense is approaching, it is inevitable that petty thieves will hide and cause trouble. It is hoped that the Bureau of Public Works will install street lights in that area, and that the Police Bureau will assign more police officers or step up patrols in that area, in order to maintain the peace of the citizens.

<h3>Economic Unification of German Occupation Zones; Agreement Signed by Britain and the United States; Costs Shared Equally, Setting Germany on a Self-Sufficient Basis</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] San Francisco, 3rd Broadcast: U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes and British Foreign Secretary Bevin simultaneously announced: the economic merger of the British and American zones in Germany. Byrnes also said that before the end of the Foreign Ministers' meeting in New York, he would ask the British, Soviet, and French Foreign Ministers to discuss the peace treaties with Austria and Germany.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, New York, 2nd] According to an announcement by the State Department: U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes and British Foreign Secretary Bevin signed an agreement here today to economically merge their respective occupied zones in Germany, in order to make the economies of these zones self-sufficient within three years. This matter had been negotiated for a long time in Berlin, Washington, and here, and now it has come to a conclusion. However, the Soviet and French occupation zones have not shown any signs of participating. The special negotiators for the past two weeks have been General Clay, commander of the American occupation forces in Germany, and General Robertson, commander of the British occupation forces. Clay arrived here yesterday from Washington with a draft agreement, which was reviewed for the final time by Byrnes and Bevin this morning without any objections, and then signed. The content will be announced later, pending approval by the British House of Commons tomorrow afternoon. According to a report from London, the plan to make the British and American occupation zones in Germany economically independent within three years will cost US$10 million, which can be shared by the two countries, but the procurement of equipment and assistance cannot be limited to the gold standard countries group.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, New York, 3rd] U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes and British Foreign Secretary Bevin agreed today to announce the recently concluded agreement on the economic merger of the British and American occupation zones in Germany, which is the most significant change since the United Nations began occupying Germany. The merger may increase the cost of the American occupation of Germany by about US$100 million next year. However, U.S. officials said that the increase in occupation costs is justified because the pooling of resources by the U.S. and British zones is expected to make them self-sufficient within three years. The French and Soviet occupation zones are not affected. Byrnes and Bevin signed this agreement last night. It is reported that the merger plan has been notified to the Soviet Union and France, but these two countries have not made any suggestions to make it an agreement between three or four countries. Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov did not directly participate in this matter, but it is reported that the Soviet representative in Berlin is already exploring the possibility of economic unification of the entire German territory.</p>
<h3>United States Suggests to the United Nations General Assembly; Demanding Franco Step Down; So as to Establish a Government Representing the Will of the People</h3>
<p>[United States Information Service, Lake Success, 2nd] The United States today suggested to the United Nations General Assembly that Franco be required to step down and transfer power to a Spanish interim government that broadly represents the Spanish people, and that government would be responsible for holding truly free elections. This suggestion was made by U.S. Representative Connally to the General Assembly's Political and Security Committee. Connally also advocated prohibiting the current Franco regime from participating in any international organizations related to the United Nations, while on the other hand expressing "sympathy" to the Spanish people, asking them to promote Spain's eligibility to join the United Nations.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 2nd] The Political and Security Committee of the United Nations General Assembly met today to discuss the Spanish issue. U.S. Representative Connally proposed that as long as the Franco regime exists, Spain should not be allowed to participate in any United Nations organizations. The representative of Byelorussia further demanded economic sanctions against the Franco regime to force it to relinquish power. Polish Representative Lange called for the severance of diplomatic relations with Spain. Guatemala, Venezuela, and Uruguay all expressed hostility towards the Franco regime. However, the Philippine representative said that he could not accept the proposals of Poland and Byelorussia, because once relations with Spain were severed, the Spanish people would feel insulted, and the result would be contrary to expectations. Therefore, the U.S. amendment should be adopted, not interfering in Spain's internal affairs, and allowing the Spanish people to save themselves and choose the government they desire.</p>
<h3>Fourteen-Nation Group Discusses the Veto Issue</h3>
<p>[Reuters, New York, Lake Success, 3rd] The Fourteen-Nation Sub-Committee of the Political Committee failed to reach an agreement on the veto issue after five hours of discussion yesterday. Indian Representative Menon suggested that the United Nations General Assembly should recommend to the Security Council that, based on the experience and lessons learned in the past few months, appropriate measures should be taken to enable the Council to pass resolutions and fulfill the important responsibilities conferred upon it by the Charter. The task of the sub-committee is to formulate a resolution from six draft resolutions.</p>
<h3>Disagreement Between US and USSR on Atomic Energy Control</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 2nd] The Political and Security Committee of the United Nations General Assembly continued to discuss the issue of arms reduction today. U.S. Representative Connally said in his speech that the United States cannot accept any plan to control atomic energy that uses the veto to prevent the investigation of the situation in various countries. Any control plan limited by the veto cannot be effective. The purpose of the plan proposed by the Soviet Union may only be to ban the atomic bomb, but the plan proposed by the United States expands the scope of the control mechanism so that it can implement control over any type of weapon. At this point, Soviet Representative Vyshinsky stood up to reply, saying that some countries that consumed a lot of war materials during the war have the right to speak, but other countries that lost countless lives during the war have even more right to speak. The purpose of the plans proposed by the US and the Soviet Union for arms reduction is to abolish the atomic bomb, and the Soviet plan also stipulates that universal disarmament should be implemented nationwide. I now propose that this committee should suspend the discussion of disarmament issues so that the Soviet delegation can carefully study the suggestions of the United States.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Lake Success, 2nd] British Representative Shawcross said in the Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly yesterday that there would be a weapon more terrible than the atomic bomb. When asked by this agency's reporter afterwards to elaborate on his statement, Shawcross only said that scientists are currently engaged in research on extremely destructive weapons. Once successful, they will make the atomic bomb secondary. The research on bacteriological warfare has not yet been noticed by outsiders, so the public should not only pay attention to the atomic bomb and think that the atomic bomb must still be the most terrible weapon in future wars.</p>
<h3>New Zealand Accepts Trusteeship Draft Amendment</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 2nd] New Zealand has accepted the recommendations of the United Nations Trusteeship Committee and will not list Western Samoa as part of New Zealand in the trusteeship draft. New Zealand has also accepted the other amendments to the draft.</p>

An agreement has been signed between China and Boeing. The "Kaydet" aircraft is the type used by the United States during World War II to train American pilots. When the Chinese personnel currently training at Boeing Aircraft Company's Wichita plant return home, they will bring all blueprints, manuals, engineering drawings, manufacturing products, and production data.

It is heard that China will begin manufacturing them soon.</p>
<h3>Agreement Reached on Minor Points of Treaty Disputes; Four Foreign Ministers' Meeting Progresses; Molotov Eager to Return to Moscow</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, New York, 2nd] Sources within the Soviet delegation state that Foreign Minister Molotov is eager to return to Moscow as soon as possible, and therefore intends to expedite the work of the Foreign Ministers' meeting.</p>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 3rd] The Foreign Ministers' meeting last night made progress on several key issues, but the Danube River issue and reparations issues remain unresolved. Points that have been agreed upon include allowing former enemy countries to retain motor torpedo boats; unclaimed Jewish property in Romania and Hungary should be managed by local organizations rather than international refugee organizations; and Foreign Minister Molotov unexpectedly withdrew his previous request to include the Italian-Austrian agreement on South Tyrol in the Italian peace treaty. An agreement has also been reached on allowing Albania to enjoy Allied treatment in the former enemy country treaties, but the final draft has not yet been prepared. The Foreign Ministers' meeting also decided not to allow Italy to participate in the International Financial Commission of Greece. There was lengthy debate on the question of whether countries that have not ratified the treaty should not enjoy the benefits of the treaty. Foreign Minister Bevin pointed out that if the four powers are required to withdraw their troops after signing the treaty, then if the southern countries refuse to sign the treaty, they would be able to retain their troops in other former enemy countries. Finally, Molotov agreed in principle that those who have not ratified the treaty should not enjoy the benefits of the treaty, and the issue has now been sent back to the four foreign ministries for redrafting. Regarding the borders between Greece and Bulgaria, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union support not changing them, while Bevin said that he still needs to consider them and will be able to make a decision tomorrow. Finally, the Foreign Ministers' meeting also decided that Greece and Yugoslavia should each obtain 150 million US dollars in reparations from Bulgaria and Italy, but the share of the two countries, Italy and Bulgaria, has not yet been decided.</p>

<h3>US Republican Party Releases Report on Crimes of US Troops Stationed in Germany</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] San Francisco, 3rd Broadcasting: The Republican Senate War Investigation Committee today disregarded the opposition of Bernas, Connally, and others, and resolutely released a report on the crimes of US troops stationed in Germany, including trading on the black market, low morale, and extortion. Before the release, Bernas, Connally, and Vandenberg strongly opposed it, believing that the release of this matter would hinder their negotiations on world peace. Currently, there are 535,000 US troops stationed in Germany, all of whom are unwilling to return home. The crimes of US troops in Germany listed by the committee are as follows: (1) Inaccurate intelligence, making it impossible for US military commanders to make important decisions on political and economic issues.

Lewis, president of the United Mine Workers, stating that if the coal mine strike were to be extended by another 48 days, the national treasury's income would be reduced by 20 billion yuan, and 5 million people would lose their jobs.

Another government economist said that the current supply of bituminous coal may be used until March 1 next year by using conservation methods, but after this date, the economy is at risk of collapse.</p>
<h3>Britain Has Not Agreed to Equip Greek Army; Sweeping Campaign in Northern Greece Proceeds Smoothly</h3>
<p>[United Press, Athens, 2nd] It was announced here today that Britain has agreed in principle to equip and supply the newly formed sixteen battalions of the Greek Army.

Well-informed sources believe that this matter will be decided after Foreign Minister Bevin returns.</p>
<h3>Attlee Meets with Indian Leaders; Urges Peaceful Cooperation in the Constituent Assembly; Gandhi Says Non-Violence No Longer Applicable</h3>
<p>[Special dispatch from our London correspondent, 3rd] After arriving in England, the Governor-General of India immediately held talks with Attlee and cabinet officials. Attlee then met with Nehru, Lawrence, Cripps, etc. who were all present. Attlee at the time urged the Indian leaders to cooperate peacefully in the first Constituent Assembly. Nehru is scheduled to return to India this weekend, and the British side has expressed its agreement.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 3rd] Indian Governor Wavell and Indian leaders Nehru, Jinnah, Singh, and Ali Khan arrived safely at London Airport at 8:40 this morning. Eighty people from the Indian Muslims, Hindus, and Sikhs in London, divided into trucks, carried the flags of the Congress Party and the Muslim League to the airport to welcome them. Minister of Indian Affairs Lord Pethick-Lawrence and Judge Henderson were also personally present to greet them. The Muslims at the scene chanted slogans demanding the division of India. After everyone got off the plane, they broke through the encirclement of more than 100 reporters and boarded vehicles to enter the city.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Bombay, 3rd] The future of India has recently become the focus of discussion for the British people. According to well-informed sources, the main topic to be discussed in the negotiations between the British government and the leaders of the Indian political parties is how to interpret the declaration issued on May 16 of this year. According to this declaration, the provinces of India are divided into three regions, each of which formulates its own constitution. (1) Provinces where Hindus are in the majority, (2) Northwestern Indian provinces and the province of Punjab, where Muslims are in the majority and Sikhs are a minority, (3) Bengal, Eastern, and Sylhet provinces. The Congress Party and the Muslim League have both expressed their agreement with this plan, but the Muslim League still insists that the northwestern and eastern Indian provinces should be permanently divided. The Congress Party believes that this is of a temporary nature, and that each province has the freedom to leave its region, but the British plan does not stipulate this. The Muslim League has a minority of representatives in the Constituent Assembly to be convened on the 9th of this month, and has no hope of expressing its opinions, so it refuses to participate.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Sylhet, East Bengal, 3rd] Gandhi, who is attempting to mediate the conflict between Hindus and Muslims here, told reporters today: "I have discovered that non-violence seems to be no longer applicable in Hindu-Muslim relations. I firmly believe that non-violence itself is a perfect tool, so the reason it has not been effective must be a technical error. Therefore, I have come here personally to investigate the reasons for the failure in the hope of finding something. Now I know that my words alone seem to be not enough, because the mistrust between the two sides seems to be deeply rooted."</p>

<h3>MacArthur's Headquarters Revokes Another Military Control</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 3rd] MacArthur's headquarters today removed another type of military control over Japanese production, allowing former Japanese war industries to be converted into peaceful industries. However, factories designated for reparations are still subject to control. Previously, the conversion of war industries into peaceful industries required approval from MacArthur's headquarters. In the future, the Japanese government will be responsible for deciding what kind of production is necessary for the Japanese economy. According to J. Tigh, director of the Industrial Group of MacArthur's Headquarters, the lifting of restrictions is intended to "promote the production of consumer goods so that both the occupying authorities and industry can save time."</p>
<h3>Japanese Government to Issue Statement Expressing Dissatisfaction with Reparations Plan</h3>

<h3>Japan's Largest Union Emerges; Three Million Demobilized Soldiers are All Members; Aims to Solve Unemployment Through Cooperation</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 3rd] Three million demobilized Japanese soldiers have recently organized the "Demobilized Soldiers Association." With its large number of members, it has become Japan's largest trade union organization. The association announced that its purpose is to seek cooperation to solve unemployment and to collectively negotiate contracts with the government. Political observers believe that the establishment of this trade union is of great significance because most of the members are infected by the former warlords and may become a disguised military organization. In any case, the association has never expressed a desire to cooperate with the Yoshida cabinet, and its attitude towards the American occupying forces remains ambiguous.</p>

<h3>National Christian Council Holds 12th Annual Meeting; 120 Domestic and Foreign Representatives Attend; Meeting to Last Seven Days; Mayor Delivers Speech, Offers Three Points of Advice</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The 11th Annual Meeting of the National Christian Council of China opened yesterday afternoon at the International Social Hall on Hengshan Road. Dr. Wu Yifang, president of the council, served as chairman. The attendees included Mayor Wu, He Dekui, Soochow University President Sheng Zhenwei, National Young Women's Christian Association General Secretary Cai Kui, representatives from 22 churches across the country, and representatives from foreign church visiting groups, totaling 120 people.</p>
<p>Wu Yifang's Opening Remarks</p>
<p>This conference is the first in nine years and will be held here for a week. The opening ceremony began yesterday with a prayer by Dr. Zhao Zichen and a reading of scripture by Dr. Liang Xiaochu. Then, Dr. Wu Yifang delivered the opening remarks, stating briefly: "The Christian Council of China has lacked time, manpower, and financial resources in the past nine years, which has prevented the work from proceeding smoothly. I feel very sorry. But our country has achieved victory after eight years of resistance against Japan. Justice has overcome violence. We should be grateful to God for the happiness He has given us. This proves that God is always present. But looking back at the wavering wills of some people during the war, their inability to control themselves, and today's fickle world and difficult environment, we have not made good use of the strength God has given us, and our moral standards have been relaxed. We should sincerely and humbly admit our sins before God. In the future, both the church and individuals should pay attention to two points: (1) Deeply progress and seek God, (2) Make the country embark on the path of true democracy. We must show it in action, use the power given to us by nature, and pursue human moral goals according to the teachings of the church."</p>
<p>Chairman's Congratulatory Telegram</p>
<p>It was then announced that Chairman Chiang had sent a congratulatory telegram stating: "To Mr. Chen Wenyuan, General Secretary of the National Christian Council of China, 169 Yuanmingyuan Road, Shanghai, and to the distinguished participants of the 12th Representative Assembly: I am deeply gratified that your esteemed council has convened the 12th National Representative Assembly, a grand event that has not been held for nine years since the outbreak of the War of Resistance. Since the outbreak of the war, Christian churches and organizations across the country have made great contributions to saving the dying, healing the wounded, relieving disasters, providing for the poor, supporting the elderly and weak, and protecting women and children, based on the spirit of love and service. Those who served on the front lines braved the rain of bullets and bombs without avoiding difficulties and dangers, while those in the occupied areas remained steadfast and unyielding to violence. With shared hatred of the enemy and a clear sense of justice, they made heavy sacrifices and never gave up, relying on the sincerity of great benevolence and courage to achieve the final glorious victory. Our country has suffered from war, and social morality has been severely damaged. Spiritual construction is very important. I hope that you will uphold the spirit of saving people and the world, promote the truth, awaken society, revitalize the hearts of those who are depressed and decadent, and establish a spirit of progress and positivity. The establishment of a new China depends on this. I am filled with anticipation. Chiang Kai-shek, Winter Month of the Year, Nanjing."</p>
<p>Dr. Wu then announced that the American Church had sent a congratulatory telegram to the Council.</p>
<p>Mayor's Speech</p>
<p>Mayor Wu attended the Council's ceremony and delivered a speech stating: "I was inspired by the Chairman's congratulatory telegram, which mentioned promoting morality. After the war, social customs have deteriorated, and people's hearts have become [unclear]. Human beings are originally half divine and half [unclear], so [unclear] is [unclear] selfishness. [unclear] God created the opposite, we should [unclear] ourselves, try to promote God's half and line up against the animal's half. I have three points of advice for the church: (1) You should bring out a heart of enthusiasm, (2) Actively act, correct social ills as much as possible, and praise good deeds, (3) Bring out the Christian spirit to deal with the world and serve humanity."</p>
<p>Representative of Shanghai Churches</p>
<p>Mr. Zhao Jinqing, representing the Shanghai churches, delivered a welcoming speech, expressing that today's church needs leaders and church talents, and requesting that the conference pay attention to this and give church members more opportunities to participate in work in society. Then, Dr. Chen Wenyuan, General Secretary of the Council, reported on the Council's work over the past nine years, including wartime relief, refugee relief, wounded soldier care, child welfare work, European refugee relief, Christian propaganda work, the development of church schools, and close cooperation between international communities. Finally, the conference observed a moment of silence for those who died in the War of Resistance.</p>

<h3>Gao Shen Da Destroyed, Arousing Sympathy; A Jewish Person Donates Five US Dollars; Staff of the Greater America Evening News Donate 100,000</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Gao Shen Da Paper Company being vandalized and burned by rioters has undoubtedly become a major news story in Shanghai in recent days, serving as material for discussions and commentary. Although Gao Shen Da has suffered a tremendous material loss, they should feel comforted in spirit.</p>
<p>"Compassion is inherent in all people." The Gao Shen Da tragedy has not only aroused the sympathy of Chinese compatriots but has also deeply moved people from friendly nations. The first person to be touched and offer deep sympathy was a Jewish immigrant, a "person fallen from grace."</p>
<h3>Nazi Atrocities Still Remembered</h3>
<p>This unnamed Jewish person, upon seeing the misfortune of Gao Shen Da, sent a letter yesterday with five US dollars to the English Greater America Evening News. The letter not only expressed his sorrow for Mr. Gao Chengxi, the owner of Gao Shen Da, but also fully lamented the homelessness of the Jewish people. The letter stated: "I feel immense sympathy for Gao Shen Da's misfortune because in 1938, I and many innocent Jewish people in Germany also suffered the same devastation. However, the tragedy we and the Gaos suffered is somewhat different: we had neither police protection nor the sympathy of the people and the government. The entire Jewish people were despised and abandoned.</p>
<p>We are grateful that China has extended a helping hand to us, allowing us to have a place to live here. This demonstrates the great kindness of the Chinese people and also proves that the future of China and its people is boundless. Therefore, I deeply sympathize with Gao Shen Da for being destroyed by rioters this time, and I hereby send five US dollars to Mr. Gao to express my humble intention. I would like to donate more, but I am unable to do so!"</p>
<h3>Greater America Evening News, Letter from the Mayor</h3>
<p>In addition, the staff of the Greater America Evening News editorial department also generously donated 100,000 national currency as a consolation gift to Gao Shen Da. The funds were delivered to Mayor Wu for transfer by Mr. Gold, the chief editor of the Greater America Evening News. The original letter stated:</p>
<p>"To Mayor Wu: We are deeply moved that you, in your personal capacity, generously donated one million yuan to Mr. Gao Chengxi, the owner of the paper company that suffered losses due to the mass riots last weekend. We enclose five US dollars and 100,000 national currency, and respectfully request that you forward them to Mr. Gao. Many people who read the Greater America Evening News' report on the destruction of Gao Shen Da expressed their sympathy. The attached five US dollars were brought in this morning by a Jewish resident who has not forgotten the persecution and atrocities of the Nazis and was deeply moved by the suffering of this merchant. His letter is attached, but he does not wish to disclose his name, so we can only briefly reveal his identity. The remaining 100,000 yuan was donated by the staff of this newspaper's editorial department.</p>
<p>We are deeply impressed by your capable and benevolent handling of this incident. We believe that this unexpected event has served to demonstrate your abilities and kindness. Sincerely, Gao Erde, Editor of the Greater America Evening News"</p>
<h3>Party Headquarters Launches Fundraising Drive to Aid Affected Citizens; Chairman Fang and Staff Donate Two Million to Lead the Way</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Reporters inquired with Xu Mingya, a member of the city party headquarters and chief of the secretariat, about the fundraising campaign launched by the city party headquarters to aid citizens affected by the riots. According to him, the party headquarters feels deep sympathy for the innocent citizens injured and the shops damaged in the vendor riots that occurred in the city the previous day. It plans to use the district branches as the core to mobilize all party members and other enthusiastic people in the city to engage in fundraising relief efforts. Chairman Fang of the party headquarters has personally donated one million yuan, and all the staff have collectively donated one million yuan. Last night, they delivered 1.5 million yuan in cash to the Central Daily News and designated 500,000 yuan of it to be given to Gao Shen Da Paper Company, which suffered the most severe losses. The remaining 500,000 yuan was used to purchase candies and biscuits, which Xu and committee members Chen Baotai and Chen Bao jointly carried to Guangci Renji and other hospitals yesterday afternoon to visit injured citizens who were hospitalized. Xu also stated that he has consulted with the hospitals to provide preferential treatment for the medical expenses of impoverished injured citizens.</p>
<h3>Vendors Request Resumption of Business</h3>
<p>[Another report] At noon yesterday, Chairman Fang of the city party headquarters met with Gao Chengxi, general manager of Gao Shen Da Paper Company, at the headquarters. Gao detailed the tragic arson attack on the company by rioters, and Chairman Fang offered his sincere condolences and expressed his willingness to do everything in the party's power to assist them so that they could resume business as soon as possible. In the afternoon, vendor representatives Zhou Yizhong, Chen Tong, Zheng Zhizhang, Gu Yutang, and Dejun visited Chairman Fang at the city party headquarters. In addition to reporting to the chairman on the situation of their petition, they also requested permission for vendors to immediately resume business to maintain their livelihoods and expressed their gratitude for Mayor Wu's concern. Fang promised to relay this request to Mayor Wu for consideration.</p>
<h3>Exploring the Mystery of Hidden Gold: Further Survey of Fuxing Island Reveals New Discoveries; Cement of Japanese Goods Buried in Muddy Ground; Packaging Paper Surprisingly Still Intact</h3>
<p>[Special Report from This Newspaper] The Fuxing Island hidden gold case is a mysterious story. The informant, named "Yang Biya," is relentlessly informing everywhere, but no one has ever seen this mysterious figure behind the scenes. His confidential report describes in detail how the Japanese army built secret tunnels on Fuxing Island, hiding materials worth 20 million US dollars, as well as two large bathtubs of gold bars buried in the soil. He also explained how the gold bars in the bathtubs were discovered, divided, and embezzled. The materials in the tunnels were transported by 20 to 30 trucks every day for more than a month. The Shanghai Garrison Command, the Ministry of Military Affairs, the Receiving Work Investigation Group, and the Chairman's Complaint Box have all received this confidential report, and various agencies have conducted investigations, but the situation is too bizarre, and after a year, no clue has been found. This time, the Local Court Procuratorate has taken on the task of investigation. Prosecutor Gu Hongbiao personally inspected the island on the morning of the 19th of last month. Two days ago, Prosecutor Gu returned from Nanjing, and it was suddenly reported that Prosecutor Gu had decided to conduct a second personal inspection yesterday.</p>
<p>Tracking to Fuxing Island</p>
<p>The reporter received this news early yesterday morning and took a car to track them down. The weather was warmer yesterday, and although the northwest wind was blowing, it didn't feel too cold as the car sped along. Passing the Waibaidu Bridge, Yangshupu Road, and Dinghai Bridge, Fuxing Island was ahead. There were naval guards at the Dinghai Bridge, and it was not easy to pass. The reporter took out his business card, explained the matter, and was allowed to pass. After crossing the bridge, we were on Fuxing Island. A not-so-smooth cinder road was about three or four li long, and it took more than ten minutes to drive. Along the way, there were many outposts, and armed soldiers in black uniforms and flat-topped caps were Chinese naval personnel. At the end of the road, a gate appeared with the words "Fuxing Fisheries" written horizontally on a large plaque. Prosecutor Gu and his party were walking slowly ahead. Accompanying Prosecutor Gu were Secretary Yang, Translator Xu, and four bailiffs. They were also accompanied by Committee Member Yu of the Executive Yuan, Section Chief Wang of the Shanghai Garrison Command, Section Chief Xuan Huifan of the Shanghai North Inspection Office, Wu Shiyi, and others. Wang Yikang, Deputy Director of the Executive Yuan Industry Management Office on the island, General Affairs Section Chief Li Jingping, Affairs Section Chief Li Yunpeng, and Technical Committee Member Wang Qianli, warmly welcomed them and first went to the Fuxing Building. This four-story building was once used as the headquarters of the Japanese Naval Landing Forces. Before the victory, Fuxing Island was basically a large barracks for the enemy navy, so it was also subjected to fierce bombing by the Republic of China Air Force. This Fuxing Building was certainly a target of the bombing, and although it had been repaired, it was still dilapidated, with broken bricks and wood all over the ground. The Fisheries Office is located here, and the newly decorated reception room on the third floor is quite exquisite but seemed too small yesterday because there were too many people.</p>
<p>Conversation between Two People</p>
<p>Executive Yuan Technical Committee Member Wang Qianli, a tall man with a square face and a small mustache, spoke slowly and comfortably. He talked about the history of Fuxing Island and the history of its takeover after the victory. He said, "Fuxing Island was formed by the accumulation of mud and sand dredged from the bottom of the Huangpu River over the years. In the 25th year of the Republic of China, the Ministry of Industry built wharves and houses on the island, which later became a fish market. Last year, after the victory, the Navy took over the island because the enemy navy had fortified it as a base for the Marine Corps. It was also used as a concentration camp for Japanese residents and prisoners. At that time, there were many and mixed troops on the island, including the Navy, the Third Theater, the Foreign Affairs Office of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the Security Brigade, and the Joint Logistics Command. After the Executive Yuan's fishing boats arrived in Shanghai, they borrowed the location as a base because there was no place to dock. The first to arrive were Section Chief Li Yunpeng and others, which was at the end of May this year. At this time, there were still eight or nine thousand Japanese residents and prisoners on the island. The Prisoner of War Management Office and the Navy guarded it strictly, and the Executive Yuan staff lived in the Fuxing Building and could not run around, so we had no way of knowing whether there were materials in the tunnels or gold in the vats." Li Jingping, the tall and burly leader wearing a leather cap, talked about the vat question. He said, "Roughly between July 15th and 18th, after a rainstorm, workers reported that they had found a vat in the soil. The white porcelain edge of the basin was exposed outside the soil, and it was full of manure. On the same day, while repairing the water pipes, they discovered a second vat, which was also full of manure and had no gold bars."</p>
<p>Discovery of Buried Cement</p>
<p>At around ten o'clock, we began to inspect the site, led by Li Jingping and Li Yunpeng. We first went to the location where the first vat was buried. There was indeed a depression, but it was not very large, only three feet deep, with Chinese holly trees planted on both sides. Just as everyone was focusing on the depression, someone suddenly noticed something unusual a few steps in front of the depression because the soil here was soft and elastic. So it was decided to excavate. The soil was so loose, mixed with a lot of firewood and wooden boards, that it was obviously filled in not long ago. Strangely, after digging less than three feet, we suddenly found that the inside was full of hardened whole bags of cement, and the cement packaging paper had not even rotted. From the packaging paper, we identified it as "Japanese goods." There were blocks and blocks of cement, and we couldn't dig them all out. By this time, it was already one o'clock in the afternoon, and everyone was starving. The Executive Yuan Fisheries Management Office prepared lunch for us.</p>
<p>A Series of Questions</p>
<p>During the lunch break, we jointly studied the case. Because it was so complex and convoluted, we divided it into two parts for the sake of discussion. First, we talked about the part about the hidden gold and immediately thought of a series of questions: Gold is not afraid of rotting, so why hide it in a vat and bury it in the ground? Where did the vat come from? Why was it buried underground? If not for hiding gold, what else was it for? Where did the manure come from? Why did the vat contain manure? This pile of questions plunged the whole place into a somber atmosphere. After lunch, we inspected the location where the second vat was buried, but it was just a depression, and there were no new discoveries. Prosecutor Gu summoned Wang Kui, the plumbing worker who first discovered the vat. Wang Kui said, "This place was originally full of grass. Because the water pipe was broken, I came to repair it and found the white edge of the porcelain basin exposed on the outside. The two vats were discovered in the same way." According to his memory, it did not rain that day, but there was water everywhere because the water pipe was broken. Prosecutor Gu and others patrolled for a week and then returned to the Fuxing Fire Building's reception room to question the driver Li Jinbiao. Li came to the island around the same time as Section Chief Li Yunpeng. He denied ever transporting materials.</p>
<p>It was already four o'clock in the afternoon, and there were still no conclusions. The roads on the island were winding and confusing. We stopped and went, and it took us a full ten hours. Everyone was a little tired. We took the opportunity to visit the Executive Yuan fishing boats and then took a car back. The materials and gold bars of Fuxing Island are still a mystery. (The above picture shows the discovered vat)</p>

<h3>Letter from He Yingqin Abroad; Agrees with This Newspaper's Editorial Opinion; Racetrack to Be Developed as a Park</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] General He Yingqin, head of the Chinese delegation to the United Nations Military Staff Committee, recently sent a letter to this newspaper from New York, expressing his strong agreement with this newspaper's editorial on the issue of preserving the Shanghai Racecourse. He also sent a letter to Mayor Wu, stating that he had recently visited various places in the eastern United States and that every city and town he visited had large parks that were beautifully designed and provided great physical and mental benefits to the citizens who rested and played there. Shanghai is a major port in the Far East, and its future development is immeasurable. Therefore, there should be a large-scale park in the city center and no more buildings should be built. (On the left is the original letter from General He to this newspaper)</p>
<h3>Labor-Management Disputes in the Grain, Dried Goods, and Noodle Industries; Social Affairs Bureau Mediates Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] Labor-management disputes in this city are emerging one after another, and the mediation section of the Social Affairs Bureau is very busy. The following three cases were mediated at the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday afternoon:</p>
<p>Grain Industry and Miscellaneous Grains Industry: The labor side demanded improved treatment, mainly with the following conditions: (1) Worker treatment is divided into four grades: 45 yuan, 30 yuan, 55 yuan, and 60 yuan, all calculated according to the government's cost-of-living index. The delivery fee is set at one dime per stone, and it should also be calculated according to the index. (2) Profits should be split 40/60, with 60% for the capital side and 40% for labor. The annual salary should be 15 months, with three months as an annual bonus. (3) Employee benefits should be organized through consultation between labor and capital, and the expenses should be borne in accordance with the Labor Law. (4) When workers are sick, medical expenses should be borne by the capital side, and wages should be paid as usual. (5) Workers should not be dismissed without cause. (6) In the future, the capital side should only hire members of the labor union. Yesterday, when the labor and capital sides were negotiating at the Social Affairs Bureau, there were major disputes due to the vast differences in opinion. The representatives of both sides slammed the table while speaking to strengthen their momentum. The labor-management dispute in this industry occurred in October and has been repeatedly negotiated, but a solution has not yet been reached.</p>
<p>Dried Goods Industry: A labor-management dispute occurred in August, and after mediation by the Social Affairs Bureau, a settlement record was established on August 15th, stipulating that the salaries of employees should be increased by 20 yuan, 15 yuan, and 10 yuan for grades A, B, and C, respectively, and calculated according to the cost-of-living index. However, 66 dried goods stores have not yet implemented the record, and the capital side's reason is that their business is sluggish and they cannot afford it. The labor union has now requested the Social Affairs Bureau to mediate this matter. The labor side requests that the three months' salary from August 15th to November 15th be paid according to the new standards first, and then the union representatives and the Social Affairs Bureau representatives will jointly investigate the actual business conditions of the stores. If they are losing money, the workers are willing to discount their wages. Yesterday, when the representatives of both sides were negotiating, the capital side's representatives said that they had to consult with the chairman of the industry before making a decision.</p>
<p>Noodle Industry: The Noodle Industry Association set the standard labor cost for workers in the industry at 110,000 yuan in September of this year. All workers employed through the union were to be paid according to this amount. However, at that time, some noodle shop owners were eager to supply cold noodles and were willing to pay high wages to hire workers, which resulted in a "black market wage" of 150,000 yuan. Currently, the black market wage is 70,000 to 80,000 yuan higher than the amount stipulated by the union. In addition, most noodle shops are unwilling to hire workers through the union, which has caused great dissatisfaction among unionized workers, and a labor-management dispute has arisen. The labor side initially requested that the base salary be set at 30 yuan, 35 yuan, and 40 yuan for three grades, all calculated according to the cost-of-living index. After compromises, both sides agreed that for machine-cut noodle shops with a daily production capacity of seven bags of flour or less, the base salary of workers should be set at 27 yuan, and for those with a daily production capacity of more than seven bags of flour, the base salary of workers should be set at 30 yuan. The annual bonus issue was also resolved during yesterday's mediation. The capital side agreed that the minimum annual bonus for workers should be half a month's salary, and the capital side would still handle how to distribute it fairly. This negotiation proceeded in a peaceful atmosphere, which was an interesting contrast to the grain industry. Director of the Public Works Bureau Receives</p>
<h3>American Engineers Hired to Come to China</h3>
<p>Director of the Public Works Bureau Receives</p>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] Zhao Zukang, Director of the Public Works Bureau, received Lieutenant General Eugene Reybold and Colonel J.P. Growden, engineering experts who had just arrived in China from the United States, at the bureau at 4:00 PM yesterday.

<h3>National Diplomacy Association Held a Symposium Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] The Shanghai Branch of the Chinese National Diplomacy Association held a symposium at the YMCA at 4:00 PM yesterday to discuss "The Current International Situation and China." More than 30 people attended, including Situ De, Chu Yukun, Wang Jishen, Gao Lingbai, Pan Shixian, and Zhang Deliu. Yan Huiqing, the president of the association, was unable to attend due to business, and the secretary-general of the association, Zai Zhuyi, represented him. He first stated that the post-war international situation is complex and has a significant impact on China's future. We should accurately understand the current international situation and seek ways to deal with it. Subsequently, Chu Yukun, Wang Jishen, Situ De, and Pan Shixian spoke one after another, analyzing the current international situation in detail and putting forward proposals for China's future foreign policy. They also believed that national diplomacy is the backing of government diplomacy. Finally, Wang Jishen specifically raised the importance of the Japanese issue and hoped that the people of the country would no longer ignore it and be intoxicated by their own victory.</p>
<h3>Shanghai-Beiping Flight Time Shortened; Giant New Aircraft Fast and Convenient; More Flights to Be Added on the Nanjing-Shanghai Line</h3>
<p>To expand its business, China National Aviation Corporation has ordered multiple DC-4 aircraft from the United States. These aircraft are manufactured by Douglas Aircraft Company of the United States and were produced before the war. After the Pearl Harbor Incident, they were converted into military aircraft and renamed C-54. They are four-engine low-wing aircraft, carrying 44 passengers, two pilots, one flight mechanic, one communicator, and two attendants. They are also equipped with a cooking room to provide guests with tea and refreshments, and they have heating in winter. The structure and performance of the aircraft guarantee maximum safety. It is reported that three of these aircraft have arrived in Shanghai, and the CNAC authorities have decided to use these DC-4 aircraft to operate in North China, opening a direct flight between Shanghai and Beiping. It is scheduled to begin on the 5th, with one flight per day, resting on Sundays. It will take off at 8:00 AM every day and return to Shanghai at 3:30 PM. The ticket price is 225,000 yuan per person.

<h3>Another Lawsuit Involving Deposits: Request for Repayment in Silver Dollars, Chung Nan Bank Sued, Court to Hear Case on the 17th</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] Disputes and lawsuits continue to arise regarding the repayment of pre-war deposits. Now, citizens Shen Haoming, Shen Cuiling, Shen Meiling, and Shen Rongling, who deposited silver dollars with Chung Nan Bank before the war, are demanding repayment in silver dollars or their equivalent in silver taels based on market price. They are suing Huang Yuyi, the legal representative of Chung Nan Bank, for breach of trust and ignoring the deposit agreement. The case stems from the fact that the plaintiffs deposited two hundred silver dollars each with Chung Nan Bank on May 26, 1930, and February 10, 1931, respectively, for a term of fifteen years. Upon maturity, they were to receive one thousand silver dollars in principal and interest, evidenced by deposit slips numbered 458, 459, 460, and 1138. The deposits matured on May 26, 1945, and February 10, 1946, respectively. Despite repeated requests, the plaintiffs have received no repayment. They wrote to the defendant, specifying payment in silver dollars or their equivalent in silver taels, calculated at seven fen three li of silver per dollar. The defendant replied that the bank was not refusing payment, but that repayment in silver dollars concerned the entire financial system and required consultation with the Bankers Association and submission to the government for approval. Until government approval was obtained, the bank would continue to pay the original principal and interest in legal tender at the original rate, without any changes.</p>
<p>The plaintiffs now make three demands: (1) The defendant should repay the plaintiffs one thousand silver dollars in principal and interest. If repaid in legal tender, it should be converted at the market price of silver taels on the date of repayment, at seven fen three li of silver per dollar. (2) The defendant should pay the first plaintiff interest at an annual rate of six percent from May 26, 1945, to the date of execution, and pay the second plaintiff interest at an annual rate of six percent from February 10, 1946, to the date of execution. (3) The defendant should pay the litigation costs.</p>
<p>It is reported that the court has scheduled a hearing for this case on December 17th at 9:10 AM in Courtroom 7.</p>
<h3>Trial of Shen Fenggang, a Special Agent of the Puppet Regime, Continues; Witness Chen Mo Questioned; Defendant Refers to Him as Superior</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] The case of Shen Fenggang, a key figure in the special agent apparatus of the puppet regime, who once served as the Director of the Third Division of "76," has been repeatedly investigated by the High Court. Yesterday afternoon, the court held another hearing to continue examining evidence and questioning Chen Mo, who was indicted for concealing a fan belonging to Liang Hongzhi, as a witness. After questioning, the hearing was adjourned to a later date.</p>
<p>Chen Mo, dressed in a black serge jacket and black leather shoes, testified that he was 33 years old and from Fengxian. He was formerly the commander of the Vanguard Corps of the Loyal National Salvation Army. Before the victory, he ordered Shen Fenggang to carry out defection work. After the victory, he appointed Shen as a detachment leader, incorporating troops and providing more than 200 guns together with Xia Zhongming (also a division director of "76").</p>
<p>When questioned, Shen Fenggang said: "The military intelligence bureau recorded my confession, but they didn't write what I said, it was all their own writing. Chen Mo formerly appointed me as the head of the Shanghai suburban intelligence group, and after the victory, he also contacted Xia Zhongming to supply guns." He also said: "I have never been a traitor for a single day. The one month and twenty-three days that I served were under orders. During the eight years, I was arrested by the patrol police, arrested by the Japanese Kempeitai, and arrested by '76.' I risked my life to fight traitors with knives and guns, but now I am being treated as a traitor. This is really heartbreaking. There is absolutely no such thing as a traitor killing traitors. My superior (referring to Chen Mo) is here today, and he can testify to the truth of my actions. Even if the presiding judge finds me not guilty, I will not accept it, because I have already been imprisoned for more than a year." Zhou, dressed in a blue cloth robe, met with his family after the court session and was escorted back to prison by the bailiffs along with Chen Mo.</p>

<p>[Report from our Newspaper] The Civil Records Department of the District Court recently gained two new female probationary judges. Yesterday, a reporter visited them and met Miss Jiang. She is a graduate of the Fudan Law Department in 1944. She joined the District Court as a clerk in mid-October of last year and was recently promoted to probationary judge after passing the higher civil service examination. She said modestly to the reporter: "There is nothing remarkable about it. A few days ago, a classmate casually mentioned it to a newspaper reporter, and they published it. Actually, there are many women in the legal profession. There are two female prosecutors in this court. Also, there seem to be female court presidents." She went on to say that she probably would not appear in court during her probation period. Her main job is to draft judgments based on case files. After the probation period, it will depend on the assignment from her superiors. She had many official documents on her desk, and a worker delivered a large stack of them. She looked very capable and efficient.</p>
<p>Miss Xia came to the court yesterday to complete the registration procedures and then left. It is said that she is a graduate of the Judicial Group of the Chaoyang Law School and was assigned to the District Court for probation without taking the higher civil service examination.</p>
<h3>The Dredging Bureau Has Dug Up Over One Million Tons of Silt</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] According to Shi Konghuai, the Deputy Director of the Dredging Bureau, the bureau has removed over one million tons of silt since taking over at the end of September last year, averaging about 12,000 tons per day. Since the dredging ships and pump boats were actively repaired and put into use, the performance in July broke the highest record, with a total of 210,000 tons of silt removed. Currently, there are seven dredging ships and one pump boat in operation, and another is being repaired and will be put into use in the short term. The silt dredged from the Huangpu River is continuously transported to Yangshupu and Longhua, etc., for filling and raising the ground. According to Deputy Director Shi, the Dredging Bureau will establish close ties with the Public Works Bureau in the future to ensure that the dredging work can be carried out actively.</p>
<h3>Difficult Times and Poverty: Sluggish Pork Sales</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] Recently, the market price of pork in this city has been relatively stable. The pig industry and fresh meat wholesalers negotiate the selling price daily based on supply and demand. Yesterday, for example, live pigs were priced at 3,400 yuan per kilogram, or 1,700 yuan per shi jin (catty). Fresh meat wholesale was priced at 2,650 yuan per shi jin, and retail meat stalls charged between 2,500 yuan and 3,000 yuan per shi jin, depending on the fat content.</p>
<p>The supply of pigs is relatively smooth, mainly Huai pigs from Bengbu and other places. In addition to a large portion being directly transported to Shanghai, some are also transported to Wuxi and Changzhou. When the Shanghai market price is profitable, they are slaughtered locally, and the fresh meat is transported to Shanghai for sale. This is more profitable and allows for cash payment. Ordinary pig traders who sell live pigs often have to wait three or four days to receive payment.</p>
<p>Due to difficult times and poverty, pork sales are very sluggish. It is reported that in the past, the daily slaughter of pigs in this city was often more than 2,000 head, but now it is only about 1,200 head.</p>

<p>According to the meteorological observatory's forecast, there will be no major changes in the next few days. As for this winter, there is no doubt that the general climate will be colder than last winter. Last winter, the lowest temperature was 26.8 degrees, and this winter will definitely break this record. The coldest period will be in mid-January of 1947.</p>
<p>In the past three days, the Pushan Villa and Tongren Fuyuan Hall in this city have collected a total of twelve adult corpses and one hundred and ninety-six child corpses from the streets. Although not all of them died from freezing, the cold weather is the main factor accelerating death.</p>

<h3>Cold Weather Leads to Use of Electric Heaters, Affecting Yarn Mill Production; Power Company Appeals Again for Discontinuation of Use</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] Due to the cold weather, most households in this city with electric heating meters are using electric heaters, which has made the city's power supply very difficult. At 5:00 PM the day before yesterday, the Shanghai Electric Power Company cut off the power to all yarn mills in the city. This kind of panic situation has never happened this year. Due to households using electric heaters in violation of regulations, daily power consumption has suddenly increased by 12,000 to 15,000 kilowatts, which is equal to one-third of the daily power consumption of factories, meaning that daily production has decreased by one-third. The electric power company urgently appeals to the households in this city to cooperate and not use electric heaters.</p>
<p>The notices regarding the monthly usage limits for electric heating and lighting for households in this city have been issued by various electric power companies one after another. After receiving the notices, all households must use electricity according to the limits. Those who exceed the limits will be subjected to power cuts by the electric power companies in accordance with the regulations of the municipal government.</p>
<p>For those who used less than 20 degrees of electric heating per month in June, July, August, September and October of this year, the electric power company has cut off the electric meter, and 2,000 meters have been cut off so far. For those who exceed 20 degrees, the month with the highest usage in mid-April will be the new limit.</p>
<h3>Winter Relief May Be Implemented Ahead of Schedule</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] Cai Dianrong, a member of the Winter Relief Committee of this city, told reporters yesterday that the central government has ordered that the winter relief in this city be implemented from the 15th of this month, but this city is considering the weather conditions and may implement it one week earlier. It is expected that the number of people receiving relief this winter will be around 3,000, and if necessary, it can accommodate up to 5,000 people. The funds have been decided to be 400 million yuan. In the face of the city treasury's deficit, it is not easy to allocate this amount. However, this relief work is very expensive. It is estimated that each person's cold-proof equipment will cost at least 80,000 yuan, and three months of meals will also need to be provided. Currently, 800 sets of clothing and bedding have been prepared, and the rest are being rushed to be made. During the winter shelter period, management is an important issue. Due to limited equipment, it is inconvenient to implement vocational training, but the actual situation will be considered, and appropriate work will be given to them every day, so as not to make them too idle. At the end of the lunar year, cold clothes will also be given away. In this winter's relief, the committee will try its best to cooperate with various charitable organizations in society to achieve twice the result with half the effort.</p>
<p>[Another Report] Mayor Wu, in order to expand the winter relief, appealed to all sectors of society for assistance and scheduled a radio speech at the Jiancheng Radio Station at 2:00 PM today.</p>
<p>In addition, the fundraising meeting of the Winter Relief Association decided to hold a radio fundraising campaign for two days starting today, at the Jiancheng, Guomin, and Yamei stations.</p>

<h3>Raw Cotton Supply Problem: President Song Sets Two-Day Deadline to Provide Five Statistical Items; Inaccurate Reports of Cotton Stock Will Be Confiscated; Draft Plan to Ban Black Market Cotton Yarn</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch] Yesterday morning at 11:00 AM, Premier Song of the Executive Yuan presided over the 14th temporary meeting of the Textile Control Committee. Those present included concurrent Chairman Wu Guozhen, Vice-Chairman of the Council of Life Li Shengbo, and committee members Shu Yunzhang, Wu Weijing, Wang Qiyu, Hai Wang Yangxian, Yang Xiren, Lin Fengbao, Rong Hongyuan, and Liu Wenteng, Director of the Textile Control Committee. Also present were the Governor of the Central Bank Bei Zuyi and Consultant Mike. The meeting lasted one hour before adjourning.</p>
<p>At the meeting yesterday, Premier Song gave two instructions: (A) Regarding the supply of raw cotton, he proposed collecting statistical data on five items: (1) the total amount of raw cotton produced nationwide; (2) the amount of raw cotton available to each yarn mill for spinning; (3) the current stock of raw cotton held by yarn mills, cotton firms, and foreign firms; (4) the total annual raw cotton requirement for all yarn spindles in our country; (5) the amount of raw cotton still needed beyond the domestically available cotton and the raw cotton stock held by yarn mills, cotton firms, and foreign firms. To expedite the collection of data, he also uniformly required each yarn mill, cotton firm, and foreign firm to submit a report to the Textile Control Committee by tomorrow (the 5th) detailing their own raw cotton stock as of the end of November this year, to facilitate centralized statistics. If inaccurate reporting is discovered, the unreported raw cotton stock will be subject to confiscation. (B) How to crack down on the black market for cotton yarn. Regarding this point, Premier Song asked the participating committee members to provide opinions. The committee members expressed their views in turn. It was then decided that experienced committee members of the Textile Control Committee should draft a concrete plan for managing yarn and cloth, submit it to the 15th regular meeting of the Textile Control Committee to be held this Thursday, and then report the results to Premier Song for approval.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Textile Control Committee sent a letter to Committee Member Wang Qiyu, stating briefly: Premier Song instructed that regarding how to regulate the yarn and cloth market and eliminate the black market, a concrete plan should first be provided for review and decision. Correspondingly, you are requested to be responsible for providing a written opinion, to be submitted for discussion at the 15th meeting of this committee on Thursday (December 5th).</p>
<p>This reporter then interviewed Mr. Wang Qiyu, who attended yesterday's Textile Control Committee meeting. He stated that Premier Song believes that past cotton yarn allocation policies have failed because the public has not benefited, and yarn mills have been constrained by price controls, but the black market for cotton yarn has not been eliminated as a result. Therefore, he instructed the participating committee members to draft measures to suppress yarn prices. He himself has not yet drafted any concrete measures, but he still believes that the price of raw cotton in this city is too high, and foreign exchange for American cotton has not been approved for many months. He hopes that the raw cotton reserves in this city can be increased in the future, and that raw cotton can be continuously transported to ensure that there is no shortage of raw materials for spinning. As for cotton yarn countermeasures, given the vastness of our country, full control is difficult. However, controlling cotton yarn in Shanghai alone has not had good results. Even temporarily restoring free trade is not something that can be achieved overnight. Therefore, he hopes to find a reasonable outlet for cotton yarn before restoring free trade. However, this is purely his personal opinion, and concrete opinions still need to be decided after consultation with all relevant parties, he said.</p>
<p>Premier Song then summoned the concurrent Chairman of the Textile Control Committee at around 4:00 PM. Guo, committee members Shu Yunzhang, Yang Xiren, Lin Fengbao, Wu Weijing, Central Bank Consultant Mike, and others for discussions, which lasted until around 7:00 PM before adjourning. It is reported that the content of the talks focused on: (1) how to strengthen the purchase of domestic cotton; (2) how to reduce the cost of packaging raw cotton and alleviate the difficulty of packaging; (3) how to streamline the transportation of raw cotton; (4) specific measures for the allocation of cotton yarn.</p>
<p>Premier Song also inquired in detail about the production cost of cotton yarn and sought the opinion of Governor Bei of the Central Bank on the issue of providing foreign exchange for purchasing American cotton. Governor Bei stated that there should be no problem in supplying foreign exchange for purchasing American cotton. However, he hopes that the export of our country's export goods such as tung oil, tea, and silk can be actively strengthened. At the same time, by revising the import and export trade regulations, the management of imported goods can be strengthened, which will be very optimistic for our country's foreign exchange prospects.</p>
<p>It is reported that the government will first initiate the ordering of a large amount of American cotton to replenish raw cotton reserves, so as to reduce raw material costs, and yarn prices can also be suppressed accordingly.</p>
<h3>Premier Song Calls a Temporary Meeting of the Control Committee to Review the Work of the Committee</h3>

<h3>Public Bonds Continue to Fall</h3>
<p>Yesterday, a certain household on the seventh floor sold public bonds, and the low price was slightly absorbed by the banks. After sluggishness, the market turned over. The opening price of the unified C bond in the morning was 1340 yuan, and the price fell from 1360 yuan to 1240 yuan. Near noon, the price rebounded to above 1300 yuan and fluctuated. As a result, the closing price was 70 yuan lower than the previous day. Class A and B bonds also fell by 5 yuan, Class D bonds fell by 20 yuan, and Class E bonds fell by 40 yuan.</p>
<h3>Oil Prices are Falling, Rice Market Appraisal: Miscellaneous Grains are Stable</h3>
<p>The rice market is sluggish in both sales and arrivals. Southern japonica rice has risen slightly by 300-500 yuan, and northern japonica rice is also active. White yuan and yin yuan are still rarely traded. Indica rice is stable. Although flour sales are slack, the factories are unwilling to sell at a low price due to the firm wheat prices and cost considerations. Bran is dull and flat. Soybean cakes are slightly active in Fujian, and the market also has little fluctuation. Raw peanuts from Nanyang are still slack, with high prices being firm and secondary prices being weak. Sesame from Guangdong is still active and remains stable. Mung beans are also quite popular. Red sorghum is scarce and actively digested. Soybeans are being selectively purchased in the local market, with a slight increase of 300-500 yuan. Cowpeas from Shantou are still being handled, and the situation is stable. Various oil products continue to arrive, but sales are sluggish and stagnant. Oil prices continue to fall, and various oils have fallen by another 6,000-7,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>The Tea Market is Not Optimistic</h3>
<p>In the foreign tea market, high-grade aged Keemun tea is stable and firm. Other varieties are quiet. As for domestic sales of black and green tea, the local and out-of-town traders are still showing little activity. Affected by the sluggish tea market in Tianjin, people are also uneasy. Judging from this situation, the future of the tea market is difficult to be optimistic about.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cloth Prices Both Decline</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market turned downstream because the previous days' gains were too large, making prices higher than those in the inland areas. Tomorrow is also the opening day of the yarn market for textile mills, and yarn brokers are not well-funded and are eager to sell. Therefore, 20-count yarn fell slightly by 57,000 yuan, and 42-count yarn fell sharply by 200,000 yuan, with very narrow sales.</p>
<p>The rising trend in the cotton cloth market is gradually calming down. Sales of various brands are sluggish. Small retailers are selling at high prices. Trading on the 6th opened with many sellers, and various grades of grey cloth and serge gradually declined. Five Blessings fine cloth was 94,500 yuan, Colorful Ball fine cloth was 93,500 yuan, Yang He fine cloth was 91,000 yuan, New Golden Seal serge was 109,500 yuan, and Jin Miao Dance serge was 109,000 yuan. Grey cloth serge was down by 1,000-2,000 yuan compared to yesterday.</p>
<h3>Various Grain Industry Associations Will Be Reorganized and Merged Separately</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch] It is reported that the various commercial trade associations in this city related to grain will be reorganized starting next month. It is said that the bean and rice industry, the rice shop industry, and the rice and grain sales industry will be merged into one, to be named the Rice Commercial Trade Association. The miscellaneous grain and oil cake industry and the miscellaneous grain and oil cake retail industry associations will be reorganized, and two trade associations will be established for the miscellaneous grain business and the oil business, respectively. The flour and bran industry will be renamed the Flour Commercial Trade Association. The Rice Milling Industry Trade Association will remain the same.</p>
<h3>Chinese Stock Chips are Exhausted, Market Price Decline is Limited</h3>
<p>Chinese stocks traded even more sparsely yesterday, and market prices were erratic. The pressure from short sellers was very heavy, but because spot chips were extremely scarce, it was still easy to rebound after the low. The morning opened with low prices for various stocks due to tight money. After the opening, stocks 223, 89, and 224 were sold and continued to decline. After 10:00, stocks 92, 97, 152, 215, etc. came in to buy, and they once rebounded by more than 10 yuan. However, due to the appearance of Yong Yarn in stocks 102, 185, and 27, and the delivery of Yong Yarn in stocks 233, 180, and 177, spot trading once fell below 450 yuan. At this time, stocks 80, 38, 162, and 151 had purchases, and there was still room for rebound. However, stock 180 continued to put pressure around 460 yuan, and stocks 28, 35, and 229 were sold again. After struggling, the price fell back to a low price. At 11:30, short covering was relatively strong again. It was heard that there were too many short sellers outside the market, and there was no interest to collect. Long sellers also only posted interest of 4.5%. People were also in a good mood, and stocks 91, 36, 152, 44, etc. all bought in. Near noon, there was a slight upward trend. As a result, Yong Yarn, Xinhuo, Xinguang, Qinxing, and Huafeng each fell slightly to less than 50%, and Maya and Jingfu each fell slightly more than 50%. Cold stocks Datong and Tongyi were flat, China Silk rebounded slightly more than 50%, and the rest fell slightly. In forward delivery, Yong Yarn, Maya, and Qinxing each fell around 50%, and the rest fell slightly. In the afternoon, buying continued to prevail, and people's hearts turned firm. There were purchases from the surface brokers. Although the buyers were scattered, they accumulated over time. Chips were exhausted, and it was easy to pull up. Although large investors such as 176, 223, and 215 sold, they could not stop the buying momentum. There was a lot of trading in the middle of the day. Near the close, there was still prosperity. After the close, bidding continued to rise. As a result, Yong Yarn, Maya, Jingfu, Xinguang, Qinxing, and Huafeng fell slightly compared to the previous close, Xinhuo rose slightly, cold stocks China Silk rose slightly more than 50% compared to the morning's transaction price, Datong rose slightly, Tongyi was flat, and the rest fell slightly. In forward delivery, Yong Yarn, Maya, Xinguang, Dongxing, and Huafeng fell slightly, Xinhuo rose slightly, and stocks outside the market were generally sluggish and very slight.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks continued to be weak under the lack of maintenance yesterday. As a result, Jardine Matheson, Yeguang, and Steel were flat compared to the previous close, Yibishi rose slightly, and Yisha and British-American Tobacco fell by around 50%, and the rest fell slightly.</p>
<h3>Sugar Prices Fluctuate Very Little</h3>
<p>Yesterday, sugar market transactions increased slightly, and the trend was stable. The association's trading prices for spot goods were 134,000 yuan for medium white sugar and 115,500 yuan for raw red sugar, both up 500 yuan. Shantou's opening price for premium green sugar was 100,000 yuan, secondary cotton red sugar was 100,500 yuan to 108,000 yuan, Jianbang's premium green sugar was 97,000 yuan, Zhang's red sugar was 100,200 yuan, Guangbang's Runde green sugar was 100,000 yuan, and Huabang's opening price for tribute white sugar was 134,000 yuan to 132,000 yuan, and red sugar was 118,100 yuan to 112,000 yuan. The total transaction volume was 300-400 pieces.</p>
<h3>Autumn Silk Purchasing Will Begin Soon, but Price Standards Are Extremely Difficult to Determine; the Central Sericulture Authority is Studying It</h3>
<p>In order to support the silk industry, the government has specially instructed the China Trust Bureau to purchase domestically produced raw silk. The price of spring silk was determined by the China Sericulture Company based on actual costs, plus legal profits, with Grade D as the standard, at 3.8 million yuan per dan. Since the start of purchasing, more than 80% of spring silk has been purchased, and it will soon come to an end. At present, the work of purchasing autumn silk will be launched again. However, the cost of autumn silk is very different from the cost of spring silk. According to the cost estimated by the Silk Reeling Industry Association of the Third District, the cost is more than 6.3 million yuan. The cost estimation method is based on three types of payments: cocoon cost, reeling labor, and interest. First, cocoon cost: 7 dan of cocoons are reeled into 1 dan of silk. The purchase price of dry cocoons is 615,000 yuan per dan, totaling 4.305 million yuan. Second, reeling labor: at least 1.44 million yuan. Third, interest: calculated at 5% monthly interest, 574,500 yuan should be paid. The total cost is as stated above, which is considered the lowest cost. Compared with the purchase price of spring silk, it is almost doubled. The chairman of the association, Chu Fucheng, has separately submitted reports to Chairman Chiang and Premier Song of the government for instructions. It is reported that the purchase price of autumn silk will still be determined by the China Sericulture Company. The company is investigating the actual cost and then setting a reasonable standard price to be reported for approval. According to Ge Jingzhong, general manager of China Sericulture, the situation of autumn silk is different from that of spring silk, because the prices of spring and autumn cocoons are mutually exchanged, and the costs will be high and low. Moreover, rice prices and wages vary greatly in different places, and standards are extremely difficult to determine. The high price of autumn silk is also a fact. The company is studying it based on the actual costs in various places, with the principle of helping manufacturers, ensuring their production costs, and not causing losses. The determination of the price of autumn silk will strive to be reasonable.</p>
<h3>Central Bank Officially and Secretly Allocates Gold, and the Rising Trend of Gold Prices Slightly Stabilizes</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Gold Market fluctuated due to the initial tightness and subsequent easing of funds. The Central Bank also frequently added pressure. After rising, there was a lot of selling. The morning opened at 2,752,000, and rose immediately after the opening. Bargaining was still fierce. Soon it rose to around 2,765,000. The Bank of China suppressed it at high prices, and it fell back. Funds were also tight. After 10:00, the Central Bank allocated 101 gold bars at a price of 2,730,000. Under the official and secret allocation, it fell to below 2,720,000 before it was maintained. Funds also gradually eased. At noon, it rebounded to around 2,735,000. In the afternoon, it continued to be prosperous and once rebounded to above 2,755,000. As a result, it fell slightly by 5,000 compared to the previous close. Jewelry gold, silver bullion, and silver dollars were all flat. The secret money market was slightly tight, and the secret interest rate was around 1.5 cents.</p>
<h3>The Seasoning Powder Industry Requests a Ban on the Import of Foreign Goods; the Import Management Committee Agrees to Consider It</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Seasoning Powder Industry Trade Association believes that foreign seasoning powder is imported continuously and fills the market, which has a great impact on the domestic seasoning powder industry. It has specially requested the Temporary Import Management Committee to ban the import of foreign seasoning powder and stated various reasons, requesting approval for import. The Temporary Import Management Committee expressed sympathy for the points stated by the industry and replied to the association yesterday, agreeing to consider it and ordering a report on the import of foreign seasoning powder and its types of brands, tax rates, numbers, and other detailed investigations and statistics for review. The association is currently actively compiling various investigation forms, which can be submitted for review this week.</p>
<h3>A Piece of Good News for the Silk Industry: The United States Needs a Large Amount of Silk; the China Trust Bureau Agrees to Supply Raw Materials to Various Factories</h3>
<p>Our troubled silk industry is currently looking for a way out. Due to high costs, the future is still very bleak. Even the raw silk purchased by the China Trust Bureau under orders is still in a state of depression. It is learned that the Sino-American Company organized by General Chennault has recently been entrusted by American importers to need a large amount of Chinese silk. In order to negotiate, Chennault sent people to contact our silk factories. The factories were worried about the problem of raw materials, so they discussed with the China Trust Bureau to supply raw materials. The China Trust Bureau is willing to supply as much as possible with the raw silk purchased. The factories have expressed their willingness to accept orders. Now they are waiting for the American side to list the detailed list and quantity of their required patterns before signing a contract with them and delivering the goods on time. The amount purchased by the American side is more than 200,000 pieces. Our dying silk industry can process and export raw silk, and the government and silk merchants will benefit from it. This is truly unprecedented good news, and all people in our silk industry are excited.</p>
<h3>Central Bank Stipulates the Conversion Rate of Legal Tender to Foreign Currencies</h3>
<p>The conversion rate of legal tender to foreign currencies stipulated by the Central Bank is for the US dollar and the British pound. The official exchange rate for the US dollar is 3,350 yuan, and the legal tender for each British pound is 13,500 yuan. The Central Bank has not yet stipulated the conversion rates for other currencies, and it is only calculated based on the exchange rate of each currency to the US dollar or the British pound, which is converted into legal tender, which is quite different. It is now learned that the Central Bank, in view of this, in order to unify the exchange rate of various currencies, has notified the designated foreign exchange banks that the conversion rates for various currencies are as follows: (1) Hong Kong dollar: 1 shilling 1.9375 pence is equivalent to 1 pound sterling; (2) French franc: 500 French francs are equal to one pound sterling; (3) Swiss franc: 13 Swiss francs are equal to one pound sterling; (4) Belgian franc: 180 Belgian francs are equal to one pound sterling; (5) Rupee: 1 shilling 5.93175 pence is equal to one pound sterling; (6) Singapore dollar: 2 shillings 4 pence is equal to one pound sterling; (7) Dutch currency: 11 units are equivalent to one pound; (8) Thai currency: 80 units are equivalent to one pound; (9) Egypt: 25.5 units are equivalent to one pound. It is reported that the Central Bank will pay depositors for foreign currency deposits in domestic banks according to the above conversion rate.</p>
<h3>The Conversion Rate is Increased, There is More Coarse Yarn; It is Difficult to Allocate Yarn at the Re-Allocation Meeting; The Actual Allocation of Each Factory is About 40%; The Price Increase of 42-Count Yarn Has Not Been Implemented</h3>
<p>The first yarn allocation of the fourth period started on the evening of the previous day (2nd) by the yarn allocation committee of the Cotton Textile Association of the Sixth District. The allocation list was handed over to the yarn allocation committee of the Cotton Yarn Re-Products Industry Association. Yesterday (3rd), the Re-allocation Association transferred the allocation to the six associations of dyeing and weaving, knitting, underwear, towel blankets, handkerchiefs, and handmade cotton weaving. First, the number of yarns allocated to the factories that had stopped allocating yarns in other cities was determined and handed over to the three industries of camel hair, canvas, and webbing for separate allocation. According to the news from the Re-Products Association, the total number of yarns of various counts allocated this time was 5181 pieces. According to the revised conversion rate, it is equivalent to 6160.26 pieces of 20-count standard yarn. However, the conversion rate of fine counts has been greatly increased. If calculated according to the original conversion rate, it will be reduced by about 600 pieces compared to the previous one, and there are still more than 700 pieces of 10-count coarse yarn, so the allocation is more difficult. The actual yarn allocated to each factory is only about 40%. As for the price increase of 42-count double-strand yarn, the person in charge of the Re-allocation Association inquired about the person in charge of the Business Department of the Textile Control Committee. It is said that it is still being processed, and this decision should still be handled at the original price. The Re-allocation Association has sent a letter to the cotton textile industry for verification. The price increase should be implemented from the next time. At 3:00 pm today (4th), the yarn allocation meeting of the Cotton Textile Industry Association will hold a meeting and has invited the re-product industry and the yarn number industry to attend. There will be discussions on the conversion rate of each count and the price increase of 42-count. According to an expert, based on the current negotiated price of 20-count, the 42-count double-strand has the possibility of increasing the price to 3.11 million yuan. The original negotiated price was 2.79 million yuan. This time, the cotton textile industry intends to increase it to 3.46 million yuan.</p>
<h3>The Black Market for Coal is Rampant; the Association Appeals for Cancellation</h3>
<p>Recently, the black market for coal has become rampant again, and market prices are soaring. The industry association has appealed to the authorities to improve distribution, cancel control, and allow the coal industry to freely mine and transport coal. According to news from the Coal Joint Allocation Office, the main reason for the black market for coal prices is the control and allocation of coal by the Fuel Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs. Since August this year, the amount of coal allocated by the committee has gradually increased, from 10,000 tons in August, 23,000 tons in September, and 39,000 tons in October, but only 20,000 tons were allocated in November. Now that it is winter, the amount of coal consumed is greater, but the coal allocated has decreased, resulting in an imbalance between supply and demand. Moreover, the freedom of coal industry peers to mine and transport coal is further hindered. Domestic production areas are not allowed to mine and transport, and foreign countries are restricted by foreign exchange settlement. Therefore, the source of coal is entirely dependent on the supply of the Fuel Control Committee. About 120,000 tons are shipped from Qinhuangdao every month, and 70,000-80,000 tons are shipped from Helwan. Therefore, the actual needs are greatly insufficient.</p>
<h3>A Large Batch of Flour Continues to Arrive</h3>
<p>The Yilang, managed by the foreign department manager of Jardine Matheson, arrived at the port at about 1:00 pm yesterday, carrying more than 160,000 bags of flour and more than 2,000 tons of wood from Vancouver, and docked at No. 2 and No. 3 pontoons for unloading. In addition, the American President Lines' Vanter Victory returned to the United States, carrying more than 2,000 tons of goods, including 700 tons of tung oil.</p>
<h3>The Lumber Market is Sluggish</h3>
<p>The price of foreign pine is expected to decline due to the continuous arrival of goods. The supply of Min wood is abundant, and prices are falling. The prices of fir wood, both large and small, are also very depressed. The market price of large timbers is 450 yuan per foot, but in reality, there are no buyers even at 430 yuan. The small timbers also have a price difference of 20 yuan from the market price, but the sales are larger. The price of quarter-sawn timber is slightly firmer. The price of Hang wood is still stable, and the goods arriving are few.</p>
<h3>Silk Fabric Transactions are Slack; Old Tianqiao Goods Rise by 100,000</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market price of factory silk was stable, and transactions were still slack. Although foreign merchants had a slight intention to buy, they stopped buying when the price was high. The price of No. 120 Tianqiao old artificial silk rose by 100,000. Other artificial silks, due to the large number of goods, declined instead. As a result, there were differences. The prices of silk fabrics and quilt covers were high and sales were sluggish. The prices of Dacheng and miscellaneous brands also fell by 10,000-20,000. The sales of other unpopular goods were lively, but the prices remained the same.</p>
<h3>Vermicelli Rebounds</h3>
<p>Recently, the sales of vermicelli have increased slightly due to winter sales, and the market situation has turned firm. The price of Shangzhuang Longkou vermicelli is 300,000 yuan, and the price of secondary vermicelli is 260,000-270,000 yuan, which is 30,000-40,000 yuan higher than the previous market. The trend is firm.</p>

<h3>Director Wu Yanin Comes to Shanghai to Discuss the Supply of State-Approved Textbooks; the Seven-Company Joint Supply Office is Strengthening Printing and Transportation Organizations</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanjing on the 3rd] Wu Yanin, Director of the National Education Department of the Ministry of Education, and his secretary Wei Bingxin, took the Beijing-Shanghai military plane today to Hong Kong to discuss the supply of state-approved textbooks for primary and secondary schools, and will sell them to the Seven-Company Joint Supply Office to strictly crack down on piracy.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] The issue of opening up state-approved textbooks for primary and secondary schools, which was once promoted, has recently entered a state of silence. This reporter met with a person in the publishing industry yesterday. According to him: the Ministry of Education held a serious discussion at the ministerial meeting after inviting the persons in charge of the eleven companies of the Seven-Company Joint Supply Office, which is responsible for printing, to Beijing last month to exchange opinions on how to print and supply the state-approved textbooks for the spring semester of next year. It was decided that the Seven-Company Joint Supply Office would continue to print and supply as originally planned, and crack down on piracy to ensure specialization. It is heard that Wu Yanin, Director of the National Education Department of the Ministry of Education, came directly to Shanghai yesterday to discuss specific measures for speeding up printing and transportation with various companies. It is learned that the reasons for this are complicated, because the textbooks printed by each of the Seven-Company Joint Supply Office each period exceed 20 billion yuan. If there is no copyright protection, each company will inevitably stop printing and supplying. At that time, can the general small printing and publishing companies bear this heavy responsibility? How many can be printed and supplied in total nationwide? How will the remote provinces and counties be supplied? All these are problems. The textbook shortage has been greatly reduced in recent years, which is far from comparable to the serious situations of housing shortages and food shortages. After the autumn sales this year, the stocks of books in various places in the Seven-Company Joint Supply Office have reached more than 20 million copies, and the debt interest is very heavy. If they are not affected by military and transportation issues, they will be profitable. There is no need to worry about a shortage of books in various places. State-approved textbooks must have a unified nature. For example, the new and old textbooks that are sold most widely in China every year, with more than 7 million copies, also have strict control mechanisms and methods for their versions, paper printing, and prices. It is definitely not open copyright and free printing and supply. Some of the state-approved textbooks directly adopt textbooks from various companies, which are revised by the Ministry of Education. Some of them partially adopt articles, texts, charts and graphs from various companies. The companies have not transferred the copyright. Therefore, if the method of opening up copyright is adopted in the future, the rights must also be studied in detail in terms of law and technology. The specific solution can be quickly negotiated after Director Wu Yanin arrives in Shanghai within days. It is heard that the Seven-Company Joint Supply Office had previously purchased and stored a huge amount of paper, but because the rumor of releasing copyright was very prevalent, they have been delayed in printing. Now that the Ministry of Education has not changed its original policy, various companies are trying their best to strengthen printing and transportation organizations and use rotary presses to speed up printing in order to complete the supply and transportation to various places as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Owning 800 microscopes</p>
<h3>Shenyang Medical College, Ready for Operation</h3>
<p>With Eight Hundred Microscopes</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 2nd] According to sources in educational circles: The National Shenyang Medical College, established after reorganizing the former Manchukuo Medical University, now has four departments: the University Department, the Specialized Training Course, the Preparatory Course, and the Pharmaceutical Science Specialized Department. The number of microscopes exceeds the total of all other medical universities in the country. When the Soviet army entered the Northeast, seventy were lost, but eight hundred remain. Since Mr. Xu Songming took over as president, he has been actively reorganizing, and everything is gradually returning to its former state. The affiliated hospital, known as the Mantetsu Hospital during the Manchukuo era, was jointly managed by the Ministry of Communications and the Ministry of Education at that time. It had six hundred beds, but now has four hundred, and is still jointly managed by the two ministries. It is divided into two parts: the affiliated hospital of the National Shenyang Medical College and the Railway Hospital of the Ministry of Communications.</p>
<h3>Secret Discussion in the Culture and Education Committee: Candidates for Secretary-General Include Hu Shi</h3>
<p>[Special dispatch from Central News Agency, Paris, 3rd] A Central News Agency reporter learned from a special source: The Executive Committee of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization held a secret meeting this morning to discuss the candidates for Secretary-General. Mr. Hu Shi, the representative of China, was also listed as one of the candidates. The eighteen-member Executive Committee considered twenty-four candidates. The list of candidates was submitted to the Executive Committee, and after screening, it was reduced to sixteen, and then further reduced to eight by the 30th of last month. The most intense competition for this position is between the American candidate, former American judge at the Nuremberg Military Tribunal, Mr. Biddle, and the British candidate, the current Executive Secretary of the Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, Mr. Huxley. The position of Secretary-General, like that of the Secretary-General in the United Nations Organization, is the main administrative officer of the Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, recommended by the Executive Committee and appointed by the General Assembly for a term of six years.</p>
<h3>Illiteracy Survey in Changchun</h3>
<p>Illiterates Account for Forty-Five Percent of the City's Population</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 3rd] The number of illiterate people in Changchun has been surveyed in thirteen districts, totaling 159,224 people. The population of these thirteen districts is 334,470, with illiterates accounting for over forty-five percent.</p>
<h3>Principal of Rehe-Mongolia Normal School Departed from Peiping to Chifeng Yesterday</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Beiping, 3rd] The Rehe-Mongolia Normal School has been decided to be established in Chifeng. Ji Qiuhuan, the principal of the school who was awaiting orders in Peiping, set off for Chifeng this morning. The Rehe-Mongolia Normal School is one of the three normal schools established by the Ministry of Education this year in the northern border regions, specifically for Mongolian students. During the Manchukuo era, the Japanese established the "Shidao School" in Chifeng. After the victory, the Chinese Communists continued to establish the "Zizhi College" there, also specifically for Mongolian youth. After Chifeng was recovered last month, most of the students of the college were dismissed. The Rehe-Mongolia Normal School is now using the old site of the Shidao School as its campus. It plans to enroll one hundred students this year, sixty of whom will be recommended by various leagues and banners. Some students have already arrived in Chaoyang and will go to Chifeng with Mr. Ji in the near future. The funds for the Rehe-Mongolia Normal School this year are sufficient, but the teaching staff is not yet complete. Mr. Ji welcomes urban youth with aspirations to serve in the border regions. Enrollment begins today.</p>
<h3>Peiping Normal College Establishes Mandarin Specialization, Enrollment Begins Today</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Beiping, 3rd] The National Peiping Normal College has established a Mandarin Specialization program this year, according to the order of the Ministry of Education. When the reporter visited President Yuan Dunli yesterday to inquire about this matter, he said: In the past, the Northwest Normal College had a Mandarin Specialization program, and the results were quite good. More than ten graduates of that program have now been employed by the Mandarin Promotion Association of Taiwan Province and have gone to Taiwan to work. Now, the Ministry is again promoting this education and has ordered our college to establish a Mandarin Specialization program. Our college has decided to start registration on the 4th and 5th, and hold the examination on the 9th. The Ministry has stipulated that the students' period of study is two years. After graduation, they will be assigned to areas where Mandarin is not yet widespread to serve as Mandarin teachers, because Peiping is a place where Mandarin is very widespread, and there is no need for this kind of talent.

During the resistance period, they were scattered in the front and rear, making great contributions to the country.

<h3>Adjustable Desks and Chairs</h3>
<p>To Be Adopted by Shanghai Fifth Girls' High School</p>
<p>The principals of Shanghai, Zhongxi, Dongnan, Biven and other girls' high schools believe that the current school desks are bulky, expensive, and impractical. Therefore, at a symposium of girls' high schools held a month ago, it was decided to invite Dai Xiangxi, the inventor of adjustable furniture, to design adjustable desks and chairs. Mr. Dai has put great effort into the design. The style is to connect the chair back to the table top, but to fasten it with screws so that it can be disassembled when not in use. The drawers are made of canvas and can be used as schoolbags when school is over, and as travel bags when traveling. Except for the chair surface and the table top, which are made of wood, the rest is metal. The main features are: first, the height can be adjusted at will to suit the student's height and line of sight, which is very suitable for practicing calligraphy and watching plays; second, each part can be disassembled, moved and placed at will, making it very convenient to carry out various activities in one room; third, the area occupied is very small, so that more students can be accommodated in the current shortage of school buildings. As for being economical and durable, that is an added bonus. The principals of the schools are all satisfied with this and plan to add a portion of them to the halls of each school from the next semester.</p>

<h3>Features of the 1945-1946 American Basketball Rules: Basketball Committee Announces Key Points</h3>
<p>The Basketball Committee announced the following about the basketball rules for this season: This year's basketball league has decided to adopt the 1945-1946 American rules, which have been reviewed and compiled by the original translator, Zhou Jiaqi, and are now in the process of being printed. The book is expected to be published in mid-this month. There are not many new rules in the book, but there are many rewritten sentences and supplementary meanings, which can provide a clearer basis for studying the rules and training basketball skills. The key points of the new rules are briefly summarized below. If you want to know the details of the method and intention, you must refer to the text of the rules. Please pay attention to it.</p>
<p>(1) If a player comes off the bench after a "official timeout" in the second half after sixteen minutes, he may not re-enter the game.</p>
<p>(2) If the ball touches the body of a player who jumps up from the backcourt, it will be considered as passing back to the backcourt.</p>
<p>(3) If a player violates the rules during a jump ball, the referee may first use a hand signal to indicate it and temporarily not blow the whistle, giving the opposing team's jump ball player the opportunity to shoot the ball into the basket or giving the opposing team's player the first chance to get the ball. If any of the above cases are found, the violation will not be counted.</p>
<p>(4) Supporting the ball high on a teammate is a technical foul.</p>
<p>(5) Players participating in the tie-breaking period are not subject to the restrictions of the first rule.</p>
<p>(6) There are more analyses of personal fouls, and the responsibilities of players to each other in the event of a foul are explained in detail. If the referee and players follow the rules to distinguish right from wrong, they can get clearer instructions.</p>
<p>(7) A player who excessively bends his body and pushes towards his opponent, resulting in physical contact, is a personal foul, "charging."</p>
<p>(8) Physical contact caused by a defending player from behind the body of a player holding the ball is a personal foul, "pushing."</p>
<p>(9) A foul contact caused by a player's body after releasing the ball is "bumping."</p>
<p>(10) Athletes must not bump into opponents, and must not dribble forward between two hands that do not provide sufficient ground for them to pass through. In such cases, if physical contact occurs, the dribbler bears greater responsibility.</p>
<p>(11) When a player does not focus on grabbing the ball, but on shielding (preventing the opponent from reaching his destination), the physical contact that occurs and the unavoidable physical contact of "pushing" or "bumping" due to the player being too close to the opponent, even if using proper defensive methods, or passing through the opponent's path with extremely fast movements, then the player should bear greater responsibility for the foul.</p>
<p>(12) The referee's hand signals are now officially regulated. During the game, officials, players, and spectators can identify the nature of the referee's judgments from the hand signals, such as what kind of foul or violation it belongs to, etc.</p>

<p>The Thirteenth District's Shanty Towns Request Installation of Tap Water</p>
<p>The Public Works Bureau Yesterday Dispatched Personnel to Survey. The Public Works Bureau dispatched technician Yang Xiuchun to the Yaoshui Lane and Xitan area in the Thirteenth District (Putuo) to install tap water. Yang met with the person in charge of the district office and the local Pao-Chang for an on-site survey. According to technician Yang after the survey: "Poor people gather in the Yaoshui Lane and Xitan areas in the middle section of An Yuan Road (east of Changshou Road, west of Jiaozhou Road), and the shanty towns are densely packed. There are about three to four thousand households, and there is no tap water equipment in the area. Most residents buy water at high prices, and the poor occasionally take water from the Suzhou Creek as drinking water. Fire protection is extremely difficult, and it greatly affects the health of the people. Therefore, the installation of tap water in these shanty towns cannot be delayed." However, it is heard that this project must wait until technician Yang submits a reply for verification before forwarding it to the water company for processing.</p>

<h3>Inside Story of Corruption Case of Suzhou Chamber of Commerce Supervisor; Underground Bank Merchants Reveal Information; City Defense Forces Strictly Investigate the Truth</h3>
<p>— Special Dispatch from Our Suzhou Correspondent Wu Shuren</p>
<p>Since this newspaper first exposed a major corruption case in Suzhou, all sectors of Suzhou society have been paying close attention, all eager to learn the inside details as soon as possible.</p>
<p>This case involves Suzhou gentry such as Fan Junbo and Lu Shaofen. On the 16th of last month, they were summoned for questioning by the Paratrooper Headquarters cum Suzhou City Defense Command stationed in Suzhou, for a period of four hours. At the same time, Lu Tiesun, Wang Yangzhi, and Wu Bingzhang, who operate underground banks, were also summoned one after another along with their account books. The detailed account of the events is as follows:</p>
<p>A Complaint Arouses Intense Investigation</p>
<p>As early as the beginning of November, Staff Director Xu Yagu, a colonel in the City Defense Command, overheard a complaint. This complaint came from a merchant running an underground bank. The gist of it was: "The local military and political organs have all taken our bribes, but they still won't let us operate openly..." This complaint immediately aroused a sense of shame and indignation in the heart of the young and energetic Director Xu. He then meticulously investigated his subordinates, and the result was that no one in the City Defense Command had taken even a single copper from the underground banks. Although the innocent are innocent and the guilty are guilty, and cannot be confused by any external rumors, the advancing soldiers cherish their military reputation more than life itself. Therefore, Director Xu reported to Commander Ma and, with permission, launched an on-the-ground investigation in many directions. The information obtained was consistent, all saying that the underground banks had spent money twice between July and September of this year to bribe military and political organs. It is said that the first time was in mid-July, with an amount of over 50 million yuan, and the second time was in mid-September (around the Mid-Autumn Festival), with an amount of about 30 million yuan. The identities of those who handled the collection of the money were also clearly identified. At the time, the City Defense Command believed that the first time in mid-July, the paratroopers had not yet taken over defense, so it could be ignored, but the second time in mid-September was during the period when they had already assumed the City Defense duties, so they had to thoroughly investigate the matter to the end.</p>
<p>Using a False Name to Accept Bribes; Local Gentry Suspected</p>
<p>However, the names of the people who were said to have handled the collection of bribes in their intelligence were too unbelievable. Who could believe that a member of the gentry occupying a leading position in society would not lead society forward, but instead lead illegal underground banks in bribery? Moreover, the underground banks that spent the money said that this bribe (the second one) was specifically for the City Defense Command, but in fact, the City Defense Command had not received a single penny. It was clear that there was suspicion of someone using a false name to embezzle the money. In order to seek verification to avoid wrongly accusing anyone, Commander Ma used a trick and sent two staff members from the City Defense Command, pretending that the City Defense Command needed funds, to visit Fan Junbo. To their surprise, Mr. Fan readily agreed that he could raise 20 million yuan and pay it off the next day. This response undoubtedly confirmed the accuracy of the intelligence. Commander Ma, along with his Chief of Staff Major General Xu Yanwu, Staff Director Colonel Liu Nongjun, City Defense Command Chief of Staff Colonel Li Yinian, and Staff Director Colonel Xu Yayin, all the senior officers of the Paratrooper Headquarters, were inflamed with righteous indignation and could no longer have any reservations or tolerance. Thus, at around 10 a.m. on the 16th, Fan Junbo was brought into the Chief of Staff's office of the Paratrooper Headquarters under an unusual atmosphere.</p>
<p>6 Million Yuan From Underground Banks</p>
<p>The questioning was very polite, but in the politeness, a solemn emotion was fully revealed. However, the development of the situation was truly unexpected. Under the very kind questioning of the two Chiefs of Staff Xu and Li and the two Staff Directors Liu and Xu, Fan Junbo actually revealed a third instance of raising funds from underground banks. The reporter's humble pen may not be able to describe this complex case, so I have specially excerpted the questions and answers between them, in their original wording, as follows: (Question) It has been reported that officers and soldiers of this Headquarters have asked underground banks for money. Mr. Fan, are you aware of this? (Answer) I have not heard of it. Only because the lending of underground banks is prohibited, the Security Team and the Police Bureau borrowed 6 million yuan to make cotton uniforms. (Question) Is there anything else? (Answer) There was 6 million yuan, and nothing else. (Question) Who handled the raising of the 6 million yuan, and where is the money now? (Answer) It was personally raised and delivered to Lu Shaofen by the three underground bank merchants, Lu Tiesun, Wang Yangzhi, and Wu Bingzhang. I can prove it. (Question) How was the funding for the Cotton Uniform Purchasing Committee raised? (Answer) It was borrowed from the underground banks. The 6 million yuan was delivered without taking a receipt, and we do not intend to repay it in the future, so no receipt was issued. (Question) Does the Purchasing Committee have letters of appointment? (Answer) Yes, there are letters of appointment, and we have held two meetings, discussing raising funds to make uniforms, and repaying it in the future with business tax revenue. (Question) Can you bring the letters of appointment and meeting minutes for us to see? (Answer) Yes, I can. (Question) Why borrow from underground banks instead of borrowing from banks? (Answer) The underground banks voluntarily provided the funds. It would be best if we could repay them, but if not, we would not need to.</p>
<p>Summoning Many People; Each Holds Their Own View</p>
<p>Based on Fan Junbo's answers, Commander Ma and Chief of Staff Xu and others decided to temporarily put aside the 30 million yuan from mid-September and first thoroughly investigate the so-called borrowed uniform fee of 6 million yuan. Because Fan Junbo said that he could prove that the 6 million yuan was personally raised and delivered to Lu Shaofen by Lu Tiesun and others, Lu Tiesun, Wang Yizhi, and Wu Bingzhang were immediately summoned for questioning. Summarizing their statements, the following points can be summarized: (1) The 6 million yuan for the uniform sewing fee was given to Fan Junbo and was a loan, put together by twenty or thirty underground banks, each contributing 250,000 yuan. (2) The money was handed over in late October. (3) Because Fan is the supervisor of the Chamber of Commerce, they trusted him and did not take a receipt, but it was not raised in the name of the Paratrooper Headquarters. (4) Not long after the 6 million yuan was raised and paid, Lu Shaofen deposited 2 million yuan in Wu Bingzhang's bank in his personal name. With the case developing to this extent, Lu Shaofen was bound to appear. Here, the reporter will also excerpt their questions and answers in their original wording as follows: (Question) Recently, in October, Fan Junbo demanded money from the underground banks. Was it distributed to you? (Answer) Fan is a member of the Uniform Manufacturing Committee. He borrowed 6 million yuan for sewing fees and wanted to give it to me for safekeeping, but I am not a member, so I did not accept it. (Question) Where is the money? (Answer) At that time, it was still with Fan Junbo. The next day, he wanted me to keep it, but I still refused. So Fan asked the original fundraisers to deposit it with them, stating that it would be paid when the sewing fees were due. (Question) They say the money is with you? (Answer) They are avoiding the important and dwelling on the trivial. We can confront each other face to face.</p>

<h3>The "Uniform Fee" Questioning Reaches Its Climax</h3>
<p>The above excerpts of the three parties' statements each hold their own views, and it is not easy to judge who is right and who is wrong; as Lu Shaofen said, they can confront each other face to face. In fact, it had to be done this way, and the questioning work progressed to its climax. The reporter will briefly record their confrontation in question-and-answer format as follows: (Question) Lu Tiesun: Who did you give the raised funds to? (Answer) I gave it to Mr. Fan. I was not present. (Question) Fan Junbo: Did you hear that? (Answer) I asked Mr. Lu to keep it. (Question) Lu Shaofen: Where is the money? (Answer) I didn't take it. Later, it was divided and given to Lu Tiesun, Wang Yangzhi, and Wu Bingzhang, 2 million yuan each. (Question) Lu Tiesun: Do you have 2 million yuan with you? (Answer) Yes, I have 2 million yuan with me. It's just a deposit. I don't know what the money is for. They gave it to me because the risk is high. (Question) Fan Junbo: Have the uniforms been made? (Answer) They have just started to be made. (Question) Fan Junbo: Who did you solicit funds from? (Answer) Only from underground banks. They are donations. (Question) Lu Tiesun: Why didn't you follow formal procedures for receiving and paying the funds? (Answer) It was really due to personal relationships. (Question) Lu Shaofen: You didn't follow procedures for receiving and paying the funds, which shows it wasn't above board. (Answer) But the people are like that! (Question) Fan Junbo: How will you repay it? (Answer) Repay it with business tax revenue.</p>
<p>County Magistrate's Statement; The Truth About Purchasing Cotton Clothing</p>
<p>The questioning reached this stage, and almost everything was clear. However, because Fan Junbo repeatedly said that the raising of this fund had the meeting minutes of the Cotton Uniform Purchasing Committee as proof, and that he was prepared to repay it with business tax revenue, it seemed that the county government could not escape the matter. Therefore, on the 16th, Commander Ma decided to order all relevant persons to return, and ask Fan Junbo to provide the meeting minutes before discussing a solution. However, the meeting minutes had not been provided by the 19th, so Chief of Staff Xu invited County Magistrate Lu Jianhua to formally inquire about whether the Wu County Security Police Cotton Clothing Purchasing Committee had authorized Fan Junbo to raise sewing fees. Lu solemnly stated that the cotton clothing fee for the Security Police this year was a total of 108 million yuan, which had already been included in the county budget, but because the official documents were being submitted to the province for appropriation and the Security Police personnel needed cotton clothing to protect against the cold, it was already imperative, so he invited local leaders and gentry to form a Purchasing Committee, whose work was purely to handle bidding and opening bids in order to be fair and there was no fundraising component. Moreover, after the contract for the cotton uniforms was awarded to Li Zhenji Western Clothing Store, the contract stipulated that 60% would be paid in advance. The county government had already allocated 35 million yuan in cash and paid fabric at a discounted price of 20 million yuan, fulfilling the terms of the contract, and there was absolutely no need to raise additional sewing fees. Lu also firmly denied that he had prior knowledge of Fan Junbo's actions.</p>
<p>Protecting the Local Area; Not Expecting the Slightest Remuneration</p>
<p>County Magistrate Lu's statement is worthy of our attention. At least he has determined the nature of this case: is it embezzlement or corruption? The reporter inquired about the handling of this case with Major General Ma Shigong. According to Ma, he said with great emotion: "It takes a hundred years to cultivate a person. A person's reputation in society cannot be achieved overnight. Our original intention in thoroughly investigating this case is, on the one hand, because there are rumors outside that the City Defense Command has received bribes, and on the other hand, it is based on the intention of persuading people to do good. Therefore, as long as the reputation of our Headquarters is maintained and they know to be cautious in the future, we will not prepare to embarrass people too much. In short, we are ordered to be stationed in Suzhou to protect the local area. It is our duty, and we will never ask for the slightest remuneration, nor will we use a single penny of the local people's hard-earned money!"</p>
<p>However, according to news from relevant parties, the 6 million yuan in collected funds is really not the object that the stationed troops need to investigate. What they urgently seek to clarify is the incident in mid-September of raising 30 million yuan in bribes purely in the name of the stationed troops. Therefore, whether there will be any further developments in the future, up to the time this reporter stopped writing, it cannot be said that the investigation has stopped here. However, even if we do not continue to pursue the matter, it is enough to give a very serious warning to some people who do not know how to restrain themselves. The actions of the Paratrooper Headquarters are indeed an emergency injection for the deteriorating social atmosphere in Suzhou! We look forward to the vigorous growth of youthful vigor, and the unfolding of new contact with the decaying forces of darkness. How should we promote the unveiling of this bright atmosphere!</p>
<h3>Western Yunnan in Suffering</h3>
<p>— Air Dispatch, November 23, Special Correspondent Xu Jilian from Kunming</p>
<p>Western Yunnan—this vast area of just over 761,000 people, but with an area of 42,120 square kilometers, would probably have been forgotten long ago if there were not occasional news reports of severe disasters.</p>
<p>Of course, such a remote area with towering mountains, rugged terrain, no rivers, and no railways has only 347 kilometers of highways that can be used for transportation. However, the length of the packhorse trails is more than 5,730 kilometers. If we calculate the average daily journey to be 30 kilometers, it would take 191 days to travel around the area. Furthermore, more than 58% of the area of Western Yunnan is in the malarial zone. Therefore, many people consider it a daunting task. It really takes the greatest determination and perseverance to develop this land.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, the two counties of Longling and Tengchong were the most severely ravaged by the enemy in Yunnan. Unfortunately, this has caused the greatest disaster to the entire Western Yunnan. The population is continuing to die, and the most serious thing is the difficulty of surviving in the disaster area. Therefore, various ethnic groups of the Sino-Tibetan and Tibeto-Burman families are flocking out of the national border, or accepting relief from outside the border. From a national defense point of view, if we do not quickly appease them, the consequences cannot be imagined.</p>
<p>Complex Ethnic Groups; Different Dialects</p>
<p>Speaking of the complexity of the ethnic groups in Western Yunnan, this is also a unique phenomenon. If we list them, according to the survey, there are: Han, Han Baiyi, Shui Baiyi, Big and Small Puman, Achang, Minjia, Nuzi, **, Kawa, Shantou, Tuli, Chashan, Han Lisu, Black Lisu, Lao Kang, Luohei, Langsu, **, Hua Lisu, and Luoluo, as many as 21 kinds. Moreover, they all have different dialects. People who come to this area will find it difficult to gain a relatively clear understanding of them unless they plan to stay for three or five years.</p>
<p>Here, we want to make outsiders understand a little about the disaster situation in Western Yunnan. First of all, the population loss after the war has decreased by more than 26% compared with before the war. The total amount of monetary losses is about 50 billion yuan. Even more unfortunately, the floods that occurred in July of this year have been rampant in the areas along the Longjiang, Yingjiang, Donghe, Shidianhe, and Dabahe rivers. Looking at the map, the area has reached 200,000 mu. Following the floods came the famine. The reason is that Western Yunnan usually has a shortage of food. Tengchong and Longling have been liberated from the enemy's clutches, and the image of poor harvests has become a reality. More and more fields are barren, coupled with the lack of strong laborers, insufficient manpower, the death of livestock, and insufficient animal power, and there is a sense of panic about seeds and fertilizers, so it is not difficult to imagine the severity of the disaster.</p>
<p>Alternative Grains Are Expensive; Diseases Are Connected</p>
<p>When there is a famine in other places, we often hear about using tree bark and grass roots as alternative grains to fill hunger. Think about it: tree bark and grass roots should be picked up everywhere. However, even "alternative grains" have become a problem in the disaster area of Western Yunnan. Do you not believe it? The price of tree roots and grass roots per catty has reached 2,000 yuan. How could this be imagined in the 20th century?</p>
<p>Speaking of the invasion of diseases, Western Yunnan has suffered even greater threats. More than 58% of the entire territory is in the malarial zone. The malaria mosquitoes in the Nujiang River Valley, Nanding River Valley, and the lower reaches of Yingjiang will surely make anyone who has been to Western Yunnan "turn pale at the mention of mosquitoes." The annual plague is also tormenting people. The latent power of this "local disease" is great. Furthermore, the epidemic area of relapsing fever is large, and the mortality rate is high. Residents in Baoshan, Tengchong, Longling, Lianghe, and **shui all call relapsing fever "chicken coop disease" because every death inevitably involves an entire family. Other diseases such as typhoid fever, cholera, dysentery, and influenza often attack, which are also secondary reasons why the population of Western Yunnan cannot increase.</p>
<p>Too Much Rainfall; Difficulty in Clothing and Food</p>
<p>Speaking of climate, those who have been to it are full of fond memories. But what about Western Yunnan? "There are no cold or hot seasons, and one rain turns it into winter." The pressure of the rainy season is also very heavy. There is too much rainfall in Western Yunnan, and the distribution is extremely uneven. The rainy season can last for up to five months, making it impossible to grow cotton. This affects the panic about clothing. Long-term wind and rain erosion makes the problem of housing even more serious. Recovery has been achieved for two years, but the recovery of construction is still less than one-thousandth. Displaced people are wandering and have no support. But doesn't the problem always exist?</p>
<h3>Rather Let One Person Die Than Let One Cow Die</h3>
<p>Mountain people are closest to livestock. Their clothing, food, housing, and transportation, almost their entire lives, cannot be separated from livestock. In Western Yunnan, this is even more pronounced. Without cows, they cannot plow. Without horses, they cannot travel. In the disaster area, there is a saying that is popular: "Rather let one person die than let one cow die." Because the disaster area now needs 50,000 head of plowing cattle. If we calculate very roughly, the death of one cow will leave an average of 15 mu of land uncultivated, and each mu of land produces an average of 450 catties of rice (15 mu of land produces a total of 6,750 catties of rice). Each person needs an average of 20 catties of rice per day. If we calculate it this way, the consequence of the death of one cow is that 4,500 people will live on the verge of starvation.</p>
<p>Relief Work Is Not Easy to Promote</p>
<p>The situation is very serious. The disastrous situation in the disaster area should have a rough idea based on the above description. However, what about relief work? Frankly speaking, it is extremely scarce. The Western Yunnan Office of the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration was established this spring, but it did not formally start work until April. The enthusiasm for work is certainly high, but the limitations of the environment and materials make it impossible for them to start smoothly. Director Xu Songjiu has stayed in Western Yunnan for a long time and is very familiar with the local situation. The reporter met him in Baoshan three months ago. He shook his head and said that Western Yunnan is more dilapidated than it was two years ago when it was recovered. Relief is already urgent. However, it is difficult for a clever woman to cook without rice. People in Western Yunnan say in unison: If it is not UNRRA materials, it cannot be considered relief. However, to obtain materials, even UNRRA finds it difficult, difficult! From a series of difficult words, we can also imagine the difficulties of those in charge! It is said that when relief work was launched in Longling, 42 people, including the speaker of the county council, jointly refused relief other than UNRRA materials and obstructed the investigation work. This made them a little discouraged. Director Xu Songjiu then flew to Beijing and Shanghai to ask for instructions. It is said that the situation is still quite satisfactory. Relief supplies can be airlifted to Yunnan. At the Yunnan Provincial Council in Kunming, some senators also suggested expanding the Western Yunnan Office into a Yunnan branch. There is no answer from the central government yet. The new director, Mr. Huo Baochu, has been in office for a long time, so perhaps there will be some new hope!</p>
<p>Problems cannot always be allowed to exist. In short, Western Yunnan is suffering. In this area that is 6,286 square kilometers larger than Taiwan, more than 700,000 people are living, fighting against diseases and struggling on the verge of starvation. What they expect and need is only the most practical relief!</p>
<h3>Kunming Fire Disaster! A Record of the Burning of Guangfu Building on Wuhua Mountain</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Yu Jilian, Air Dispatch from Kunming, 25th</p>
<p>On the afternoon of November 24th, at two o'clock, a major fire, unseen in Kunming for several years, broke out. The place burned was Guangfu Building on Wuhua Mountain, the most notable landmark in Yunnan, the seat of the Yunnan provincial government since the Republic of China, and the palace of Wu Sangui, the Prince Who Pacified the West. More than twenty-eight years ago, a military government supporting the Republican army was established here. Governor Tang Jiyao issued orders from here, crushing Yuan Shikai's imperial dream. This residence on the mountaintop had a glorious historical significance in restoring the country, hence, it became the origin of the name "Guangfu Building."</p>
<p>Gasoline Used for Mopping the Floor, Fire Started Carelessly</p>
<p>The cause of the fire was very coincidental: On a Sunday afternoon, a section member of the provincial government led four workers to "wax" the floor of the chairman's office. To make the floor smooth and shiny, yellow wax was mixed with gasoline, heated, and warmed. Carelessly, the gasoline caught fire, and smoke billowed. The fire god Zhu Rong suddenly descended. The workers panicked, pulling the floor covering to try to extinguish the fire, but inadvertently made it worse, spilling a bucket of leftover gasoline in the corner. Instantly, the fire was "fueled," and with the help of the wind, this historically valuable and renowned building was engulfed by flames.</p>
<p>Anyone who has been to Yunnan has admired the mystery of this majestic building atop the mountain. Indeed, the people of Yunnan respect Wuhua Mountain no differently than the people of the former capital view the Ming Palace. It has become the most familiar "name" to the seventeen million people of Yunnan, a building that stands atop a jungle-covered mountain, both desirable and inaccessible, with two rows of two-story office buildings and a connected three-story building in the middle, with the large gilded characters of "Wang Zhao" inscribed on it. This is precisely the location where the Yunnan Provincial Governor's Office, the Military Governor's Mansion, the Provincial Government, the Commander-in-Chief's Headquarters, and the Pacification Commissioner's Office have been stationed throughout history.</p>
<p>Surrounded by Mountains, the Whole City Lights Up at Dusk</p>
<p>In the evening, one of Kunming's Eight Scenic Wonders, "Wuhua Encircling," was displayed on this mountaintop. From here, you can overlook the entire Kunming's lakes and mountains, like Kun Lake, Emerald Sea, and the famous Reclining Buddha Mountain and Sleeping Beauty Mountain, all within sight, evoking thoughts of Roman Emperor Caesar. Therefore, many older generations in Yunnan say: Wuhua Mountain has good geomantic power. Don't believe it? Look at "Surrounded by mountains, the whole city lights up at dusk."</p>
<p>Because Wuhua Mountain is the location of the highest authority in Yunnan Province, the source of the people's fortune and misfortune, access is heavily guarded. The general public has a sense of reverence and fear towards it. Some people have never "been up the mountain" in their entire lives. Thus, Guangfu Building has become an object woven of reverence, fear, mystery, and doubt. As a citizen, one can only look up from a distance, admiring the row of neat, red buildings. Old timers in Yunnan told me: The past martial arts school of Chenghua Garden, now the Fifth Branch of the Central Military Academy, its gate faces Guangfu Building. Some interpret it this way: The military academy students, upon exiting the gate, immediately see Wuhua Mountain, and involuntarily feel a sense of illusion, "I should go sit up there for a couple of days." This caused some concern, so the authorities later moved the gate of the military branch to Honghua Bridge, preventing it from directly facing Wuhua Mountain again.</p>
<p>Exquisitely Decorated Reception Hall, Various Ghost Stories</p>
<p>The interior of Guangfu Building was quite exquisite. The lower level was a magnificent reception hall, surrounded by high walls with white lacquered and gilded carvings, hanging with exquisite chandeliers gifted by Master Zhang Zuolin, velvet carpets, valuable oil paintings, elegant sandalwood chairs, and screen-like large mirrors… all becoming beautiful and delicate embellishments to this building. The offices seemed somewhat dark and spacious, as each room was also inlaid with Qing Dynasty stone tablets, with a long corridor and walkway outside. Thus, many ghost stories were talked about by the guards stationed on the mountain.</p>
<p>During the more than eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, Yunnan suffered many major bombings, but Guangfu Building on Wuhua Mountain still stood tall, making people see it as a symbol of magic. In February of this year, the Yunnan Provincial Government was reorganized. Wuhua Mountain, under heavy guard, did not suffer the slightest damage. Although "the landlord changed," the glorious historical traces of Guangfu Building still radiated light. Who would have thought that a major fire would engulf this historically significant building?</p>
<p>Egyptian King's Golden Palace Borrowed by the God of Fire</p>
<p>The fire reflected red across half the sky, and even at four in the morning, smoke was still smoldering. Although the firefighters fought bravely, they ultimately could not overcome the power of heaven. On the morning of the 25th, the reporter rushed to the fire scene. The embers had not yet extinguished. The conference hall and reception hall, where provincial government meetings were held and hundreds of foreign guests were received in the past, were already a desolate wasteland, a pile of rubble. One could only offer a final lament and elegy to the wind.</p>
<p>Most of the documents and files were rescued, which was a blessing in disguise. The planned joint office, which had been planned for a long time, was now forcibly implemented. Several perpetrators were in custody, and the person in charge resigned to take responsibility. Guangfu Building would henceforth only be a historical term. I still remember British journalist John Gunther describing the reception hall of Guangfu Building in his "Inside Asia," saying, "This gilded reception hall is as rich and magnificent as the golden palace of an ancient Egyptian king." As I left the fire scene, I had a hallucination of a towering palace!</p>

<h3>Dictatorship in Yugoslavia</h3>
<p>— Translated and excerpted by Zhang Yiren from Reader's Digest</p>
<p>The author, B.ita, is a senior official of the South Government, married to the famous Italian historian Bula. He is engaged in journalism in New York.</p>
<p>Communists around the world are seeking "democracy." Everywhere outside the Soviet Union, they are eager to join the "National Front," "People's Front," "Progressive People's Committee," and other similar organizations in order to promote "democracy." Having resided in this country for a long time, I have some experience and insight into this cunning "strategy," and now I might as well record one or two things for reference.</p>
<p>Dictatorial Politics</p>
<p>In 1945, the South Government appointed me as the director of the foreign intelligence group for Marshal Tito's propaganda. The Tito government claimed to be the "People's Front," and all ethnic groups in the country were equal, regardless of party affiliation or political views. Thus, the Communist Party also had a foothold in the government. The Communist Party always advocated "management" rather than "cooperation," so all the "powerful figures" in the country were absorbed, resulting in the opposite of "democracy"; there was no freedom of speech, publication, or thought, and the people's thoughts were dominated by the "political police." Arrests, imprisonments, death sentences, and massacres were possible at any time. The South Government was simply a terrifying dictatorship!</p>
<p>The Communist Party called ordinary believers in "democracy" "useful fools," and I was one of them. In 1943, I was the head of the South Government's intelligence group in New York. I had been employed by the Yugoslav government since 1928. The pre-war South Government lacked democratic ideals. Tito had convened the First National Liberation Conference, so I suspected that Tito's government might be the beginning of democratic politics.</p>
<p>Of course, I thought a democratic federal government would be better than Emperor Peter the Great's imperial government, so I supported Tito and often published articles in American newspapers. I had an article published in National Magazine saying, "New Naslav is growing, and I like the Tito government because the hopes of our new country are all pinned on this government."</p>
<p>Secret Police</p>
<p>Therefore, I returned to China by ship from New York in November 1940, and my whole family went to the pier to see me off. At that time, I dreamed that they would soon be able to live with me in the free territory of Yugoslavia. When I arrived in Barglade, flowers of freedom were everywhere—freedom given by the Soviets. The streets were full of Soviet soldiers, and looking into the shop windows, there were photos of Marshal Stalin, so I didn't mind the Soviet soldiers robbing my watch. "Give me this watch" was the common phrase used by the Soviet army to the citizens of South Korea. Watches clearly had a special interest for this group of "liberators." Indeed, they were "liberators," part of our Slavic nation.</p>
<p>The ruling class before the war has now become ragged vagrants. Since I took office in the propaganda department, I have been secretly monitored by secret communists, because I wrote a book in 1940 called "The Suffering of Europe," which they thought was too biased towards democratic ideas. The propaganda minister at that time was Save Kosa nvich, now the ambassador to Washington. Because he was not a communist, the department's affairs were controlled by his assistant, a communist, and Foreign Minister Ivan Subasich was also not a member of the party, so his power was in the hands of a communist.</p>
<p>At first, the Communist Party declared that the "White House" would be turned into dormitories for children and workers, but now the opposite is true—the White House is now Marshal Tito's residence, the most magnificent in the country.</p>
<p>Deathly Still</p>
<p>Tito likes to smile, is quite capable, dresses like Corin, and has a style like Mussolini. Like fascism, communism also needs a lively "symbol"; when he inspects the ranks of workers, civil servants, and school-age children, Tito smiles as a courtesy, listening to the cheers from the ranks: "Tito is ours; we are Tito's. Tito! Tito!" At that time, Tito seemed like God on earth. Each of Tito's speeches was entirely written by the Minister of Finance (a member of the Workers' Party) and a friend of Stalin.</p>
<p>In order to rule over the 14 million people of Yugoslavia, the South Government established a secret police structure called the "Ministry of Civil Defense," employing 100,000 "spies," and also had organizations similar to Hitler's Fifth Column, whose food, clothing, and housing were the richest in the country.</p>
<p>I made a three-mile domestic trip and found that everything was deathly still. In my hometown, an old woman asked me, "Why are you here? Only the dead are happy here." A farmer said to me: "The Communist Party has come, and we are free. They took our sixty children away, and now there is no news. We used to be able to dance together, but now no one comes to dance with us. Besides working, we just have to sit at home. This is what they call our freedom!"</p>
<p>It is obvious that the actions of the Tito government were entirely controlled by the Soviet government. The position of the South Country can be said to be a vassal state. The Soviet government's policy wants to bring South Korea and the United States into a state of opposition.</p>
<p>In short, the Soviet Union's policy intends to merge the six Yugoslav ethnic groups into Bulgaria and Albania to form a "Balkan Federation," and then merge this federation into the Soviet Federation to become a republic of the Soviet Union. In this way, Soviet Russia can directly cross the Black Sea to reach the Adriatic Sea, pass through Albania, and then enter the Mediterranean Sea. The Soviet Union's attempt is unprecedented since the Tsarist Russia, and it is really shocking to hear!</p>
<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>Poland on Success Lake</h3>
<p>— Chu Yukun</p>
<p>From Investigating Foreign Troops to Disarmament</p>
<p>The world situation after the war has been in an uncertain stage; recently, it has fallen into a dormant state. Only Poland on Success Lake has repeatedly risen, and there have been verbal battles in the United Nations General Assembly. In the past week, the focus of the debate has shifted from investigating foreign troops to the issue of disarmament. Although both of these issues were raised by the Soviet representative, and Molotov also wanted to use them as tools to attack Britain and the United States, the result of the debate was that the Soviet Union suffered repeated setbacks, and the United Nations General Assembly passed amendments proposed by British and American representatives.</p>
<p>Domestic and Foreign Investigations Simultaneously</p>
<p>When the United Nations Security Council met on November 26 to discuss the issue of investigating foreign troops in various countries, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov proposed a compromise plan advocating two points: (1) All member states of the United Nations should, in accordance with the amendments proposed by the representatives of various countries, provide accurate information on their military strength stationed in other member states of the United Nations or in the territory of former enemy countries before January 1, 1947; (2) postpone the discussion on the issue of troops held domestically by various countries of the United Nations until the issue of universal disarmament is discussed, and discuss it together.</p>
<p>However, British representative Elbeck and American representative Connally still expressed their dissent to the Soviet Union's compromise plan. At the end of the debate, the United Nations Political and Security Committee passed the British proposal by a majority of forty votes to ten. According to the British proposal, it is advocated that the troops stationed abroad by member states of the United Nations and all troops within their borders should be investigated simultaneously. However, the proposal submitted by the Soviet representative to investigate the armaments of various countries was rejected and not discussed.</p>
<p>Disarmament Issue Raised Again</p>
<p>The United Nations General Assembly discussed the issue of disarmament again on the 28th. The original proposer, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, again expressed his views, strongly stating that "universal disarmament is of great benefit to all countries, whether they are large or small. The hope of mankind rests on this." Then, French representative Balodi took the floor and expressed his support for the Soviet proposal. As for the main points of the Soviet proposal, there are four: (1) For the sake of world peace, the United Nations General Assembly should recognize the principle of universal disarmament of all countries; (2) the use of atomic energy for military purposes should be prohibited; (3) the United Nations General Assembly should propose to the Security Council to ensure the implementation of these principles; (4) the United Nations General Assembly should appeal to all member states to provide all necessary assistance to the Security Council.</p>
<p>However, the Australian representative proposed an amendment, according to which the representative of the Communist Party, Meijin, stated: (1) the issue of disarmament should be resolved at the same time as the issue of security; (2) prevent future agreements from invalidating existing conventions; (3) the disarmament mechanism should take into account the work carried out by the United Nations Supreme Staff Council; (4) the principle of equality of all countries must be clearly stipulated and must be used as the basis for discussion. At the same time, American representative Connally also expressed his views, clarifying the United States' attitude towards the issue of disarmament. In fact, (1) disarmament and collective security should advance simultaneously, (2) the United Nations General Assembly should take definite measures to ensure that disarmament is universal and effective; (3) atomic energy must be controlled by United Nations agencies; (4) we must pay special attention to all active troops in various countries, and we should also take into account the troops that can be mobilized at any time.</p>
<p>China's Attitude Synthesizes Opinions</p>
<p>As for China's attitude towards this issue? Dr. Gu Weijun explained it: He said: "After carefully studying the proposals put forward by the Soviet Union, Australia, and Canada, I believe that the Soviet Union's plan is the simplest, even too simple, and needs to be revised and supplemented. Therefore, the amendment proposed by Canada is the most useful, and the amendment of Australia is also the same. In summary, it can be summarized into four specific measures: (1) In accordance with the provisions of Article 43 of the United Nations Charter, organize international troops; (2) Although the Atomic Energy Commission must continue to work in accordance with the current rules and procedures, all atomic weapons and other weapons of mass destruction should be prohibited; (3) In accordance with the principles revealed in the amendments of Canada and Australia, establish an international control mechanism and monitoring system; (4) All countries should support the Security Council and the Atomic Energy Commission and provide assistance to ensure that their work can proceed smoothly.</p>
<p>The opinions of various countries on the issue of disarmament are too divergent, and no conclusion can be reached in the General Assembly, so it has to be shelved and temporarily not discussed.</p>
<h3>The Soviet Navy is Still Insignificant Compared to Britain and the United States</h3>
<p>— [Translated by Daishan from Reuters data]</p>
<p>Although the Soviet Union has recently been building battleships with sixteen-inch caliber giant guns and is building or has built aircraft carriers of 22,000 tons, according to existing information, it is sufficient to prove that since the defeat of Germany, the Soviet Union has made very little progress in starting to build a strong Red Fleet.</p>
<p>The latest edition of Jane's Fighting Ships magazine says: Soviet naval engineers have been building battleships named Trille International, equipped with nine sixteen-inch guns. Its keel was laid in the Leningrad Port Dock in 1939. At the same time, another giant ship of the same class may be under construction in the same port in the Baltic Sea.</p>
<p>The aircraft carrier Krasnaya Znamya, equipped with twenty-two aircraft, may have been completed recently or launched last year. Jane's report did not mention the information about the Soviet Union's start of new shipbuilding last year, so it can be determined that the Soviet fleet is still an incomparably small number compared to the British and American navies. In 1946, after World War II, the British and American naval officers and staff numbered 492,800 and 550,000, respectively. Jane's report says that the Red Fleet has a total of 23,600 staff members.</p>
<p>According to Jane's report, the Soviet Union's current largest naval heavy gun is a twelve-inch caliber rifled bore with a 714-pound projectile. Currently, the United States has five types of heavy naval main guns, two of which are sixteen-inch caliber and can fire 2,100-pound projectiles. The United Kingdom has four types of heavy guns, including a sixteen-inch rifled bore that fires 2,461-pound projectiles. Jane's believes that the Soviet Union has only four old battleships and ten cruisers, including the German Nuremberg, which was decided to be taken over by the Soviet Union at the Potsdam Conference. The Soviet Union obtained an American cruiser during the war, now renamed the Mooming, and other smaller British and American ships. The Soviet Union obtained seven German cruisers and seven smaller Nazi ships, as well as ten submarines and two icebreakers.</p>
<p>Jane's believes that the Soviet Union has already plundered one cruiser and several gunboats from the puppet Manchukuo. In addition, Jane's also believes that the Soviet Union already has more than 100 submarines.</p>
<p>Judging from the current state of the Soviet fleet, it is extremely small compared to Britain and the United States.</p>
<h3>One World, Cartoon Explanation</h3>
<p>The New York Press Association (reporter Mao Shuqing of this newspaper is one of the members) held a banquet on November 11 at the 18th floor restaurant of the Waldorf Hotel in New York to welcome the chief representatives of various countries to the United Nations General Assembly and the representatives of various countries to the Security Council. On the menu, famous international painters and Ji Lun drew historically rich cartoons. All the giants were dressed in foreign costumes. For example, Barnes was dressed in Chinese costumes, Gu Weijun was dressed in French costumes, Bevin was dressed in Russian costumes, and Molotov was dressed in Scottish costumes, etc. At the same time, Barnes was holding a document with five languages written on it, indicating that the world is one family, without boundaries. Strange costumes were mixed together in a crowded hall, and everyone was happy. The picture is lively and vivid, using humor to the fullest.</p>
<h3>Connally: One of the Decision-Makers of American Foreign Policy</h3>
<p>— Translated by Yu Qiang</p>
<p>Who decides American foreign policy? President Truman? No! Readers only need to recall the circumstances surrounding Wallace's pronouncements to understand that behind him, there is a hidden, enormous power manipulating things. Secretary of State Byrnes? Also no, he, like Truman, is merely an executor. Then who is issuing orders from behind the scenes? – The Foreign Relations Committees of the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives. To be more specific, it is the chairmen of these two committees: Connally and Vandenberg.</p>
<p>Let's talk about Connally here.</p>
<p>Tom Connally was born in McLennan County, Texas, in 1877. He was a country boy. From a young age, he had great eloquence, and the locals gave him the nickname "Talking Tom." Because his legs were very thin, he also got the nickname: "Double-Barreled Short Gun." His father often said to him: "If I had your education, I would have been in Congress long ago."</p>
<p>So Connally was determined to become a member of Congress when he was young. And he finally achieved his goal, entering the halls of Congress in 1916. When Connally was campaigning, his opponent pretended to be a simple man, riding around the district in a conspicuously dilapidated car, giving campaign speeches. Connally wanted to find an even more dilapidated car to compete, but couldn't find one. So, he had a stroke of inspiration and abandoned his original plan, buying a beautiful, big car with red wheels. He said to the voters: "If my opponent doesn't even have the ability to buy a decent car for himself, he doesn't have the ability to represent you in Congress." The voters agreed with him, and he was elected.</p>
<p>Since then, Connally has been living the life of a congressman in Washington. In 1928, he was elected as a senator, and has been re-elected ever since. Although Connally has been a "resident" in Washington for thirty years, he still speaks authentic Texas American English, full of ungrammatical slang. His family is also filled with a strong hometown flavor. He and his wife are popular for their Sunday breakfast of sausage, light red ham, peaches, and smoked ham – all of which are brought from Texas.</p>
<p>Connally is known as the "Peacemaker from Texas." After World War I ended, he vigorously supported the League of Nations and the World Court. When Senator Nye accused President Wilson of deceiving the country into entering the war, the first to challenge Nye was Connally. During this World War, in order to defeat fascism and obtain lasting peace, he led the passage of the repeal of the Neutrality Acts in the Senate, and passed the Lend-Lease Act – as Chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, it was his responsibility to lead the senators in passing treaties and agreements to strive for peace.</p>
<p>Because of these things, what Connally says carries weight. The hallway of his reception room is often filled with people, who have come to listen to his opinions. Connally is not only eloquent, but also good at imitating, with many gestures, showing no airs whatsoever. He is almost seventy years old this year, with white hair that hangs down behind his head almost to his collar, plus his stiff white shirt, deliberately careless black bow tie and a long black coat, make his appearance very much like an actor playing a role in a Shakespearean play from the old days.</p>
<p>Now, Connally is working for peace for the second time. The League of Nations failed, what about the United Nations? He enthusiastically participated in the San Francisco Conference, and the month before last, he went to the Paris Peace Conference despite the arduous journey. But the hope for world peace is becoming increasingly dim. Recently, at the United Nations Political Committee meeting, Connally and Molotov argued heatedly about the issue of reporting on military bases and military equipment. Will this veteran, who has experienced many setbacks, give up his faith in world peace because of this?</p>

<h3>Familiar Footsteps</h3>
<p>— Zheng Muzhi</p>
<p>"Beside the ideal, there is also material life!" - Alexandre Dumas the Younger</p>
<p>One day, I went to a very ordinary banquet, but I drank a lot of wine. I was drunk, horribly drunk!</p>
<p>I groped along the street wall, staggering back. I fell on the bed, wanting to close my eyes and rest for a while, but my face was swollen and throbbing from the wine, and my throat was dry and uncomfortable. At that moment, I didn't hesitate, and called the servant to bring a basin of cold water to quench my thirst and wash my face. This healed most of the madness; I held a cigarette and sat silently on the sofa again.</p>
<p>At this time, I didn't want to sleep anymore. The mood of the night was like a beautiful and shy girl. Moonlight had leaked in through the window covered with air-raid paper, peeking at me, this young man suffering from hysteria, while I was still quietly blowing thick smoke rings... At this moment, a burst of tick-tock footsteps suddenly started outside the window. It was already around twelve o'clock; I tilted my head and listened quietly. The sound was very familiar. I gently opened the window. I lived upstairs, so I had to shrug my shoulders and explore downwards; a dark figure occupied the left side of a telephone pole less than a foot away from here, looking to the right, he had stopped his footsteps, guarding so melancholically.</p>
<p>I thought of my friend X, so I happily blew a sharp whistle. The whistle echoed through the entire street, but he still didn't show any emotion.</p>
<p>"Who is it?"</p>
<p>I didn't say it.</p>
<p>For a long, long time, he still didn't move, not even wanting to smoke a cigarette. I started to get a little scared.</p>
<p>"However, it can't be a ghost, can it?"</p>
<p>I thought, suddenly coerced by a kind of fear, quickly abandoned the window, ran to the bed, held my breath, my whole body was only trembling.</p>
<p>"Maybe it's a ghost!"</p>
<p>I thought certainly; but later, I eventually fell asleep in a daze.</p>
<p>When I woke up early the next morning, I remembered what happened last night. I leaned on the window to explore, but I was disappointed. There wasn't even anything left beside the telephone pole, standing upright very gracefully. I suspected it might be a dream, perhaps because I was drunk.</p>
<p>But around eleven o'clock that evening, I woke up from a dream, and heard the familiar footsteps again. He was wandering on the sidewalk. In the silent night, his anxious footsteps showed a great deal of fear.</p>
<p>I leaned on the window sill and watched.</p>
<p>He was never tired, and never said a word. Sometimes he wandered back and forth, sometimes he leaned against the telephone pole, like a ghost. I knew he wouldn't come to hurt me, I wasn't afraid, until I couldn't hold on any longer, I went back to bed to lie down, he was still pacing there without any fatigue. I had no way of knowing when he went home.</p>
<p>And after that, for a week, he came to wander every night.</p>
<p>I remember it was a Sunday evening. It was drizzling. It was already half past eleven. I thought he must be afraid of the rain tonight, or for some other reason, he wouldn't come again, but when I was leaning on the table writing a letter to a traveler, the familiar footsteps started again. It was him. It was a familiar dark figure who had been wandering for a week. He didn't wear a raincoat, only covering his head with an old Panama hat. Obviously, he was a little annoyed and upset, but still paced past my window again, indifferent.</p>
<p>The drizzle didn't stop until after twelve o'clock, and it was getting heavier and heavier. I was really anxious for him, but he stood under the eaves of a house for a while, as if to squeeze the water off his body and hat, and then walked away indifferently.</p>
<p>The rainy season in June, the air was humid and there was no hope of stopping.</p>
<p>When I reopened the window, he was unimaginably soaked.</p>
<p>"Hey!"</p>
<p>I shouted out with a lot of regret, assuming he was really a ghost.</p>
<p>But he looked up with very surprised eyes.</p>
<p>For a long, long time, I finally said again:</p>
<p>"The rain is very heavy, would you like to come in and sit for a while?"</p>
<p>"..." He hesitated for a while, "But... alright!"</p>
<p>I went downstairs to open the door, letting that dark figure soaked all over tiptoe in. We then sat down under a dim yellow electric light. At this time, I began to see his face clearly. It was a fair face, with a high nose bridge and deep-set eyes, shining brightly, his eyebrows long and dark, a beautiful-faced young man, but why did he keep wandering here? Wasn't he afraid of the severity of the curfew night?</p>
<p>My trembling fingers were a little scared.</p>
<p>However, I immediately covered it up by handing him a cigarette.</p>
<p>"Do you smoke?"</p>
<p>"Thank you."</p>
<p>He nodded slightly, accepting my cigarette.</p>
<p>At the same time, I also lit one. Thick smoke rings came out of his mouth, staying in front of my eyes. I touched the armrest of the sofa and my own hair. It probably wasn't a dream, right! Me doing this made him laugh, laughing very horribly! It was like a ghost mocking a dying patient, but I also put on a smile.</p>
<p>Again, a long, long silence, I only smoked bitterly. He calmly paid attention to the rain outside the window, but outside the window, there was nothing but the sound of rain, even the dogs had hidden.</p>
<p>"You come every night?"</p>
<p>I broke the terrible silence first.</p>
<p>"Every night?" He looked at me in surprise, "Coming every night."</p>
<p>"You probably love the moonlit nights here very much?"</p>
<p>"..." He reluctantly nodded.</p>
<p>"But it's raining heavily today!"</p>
<p>At this moment, it seemed that someone was walking outside the window. He quickly jumped up from the sofa, opened the window and leaned on the window sill to whistle. The whistle he blew was so pleasing to the ear, one section, two sections, three sections, the pedestrians on the street went far away, he repeatedly returned to the sofa, his pale face seemed to have been slapped, showing a little blush when he saw me.</p>
<p>"You went to the window, ... but why?"</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>He seemed unwilling to say it, lowered his head and sobbed sadly. I quickly took out a handkerchief and handed it to him. I knew I shouldn't have asked like that, it was a little too embarrassing.</p>
<p>"Have another cigarette!"</p>
<p>He shook his head, sobbing even harder.</p>
<p>I was also melted into his emotions at this time. I didn't know what I was doing at this time. I believed that human beings are animals of inspiration. If emotions are lost in a dull and melancholy rainy season, then he will always be melancholy, and will never arouse good feelings towards the world.</p>
<p>Therefore, his crying was a compelled expression.</p>
<p>"Will you come tomorrow?" I asked.</p>
<p>He shook his head.</p>
<p>"The day after tomorrow?"</p>
<p>He also shook his head.</p>
<p>"When will you come again?"</p>
<p>"Never come again."</p>
<p>"Really?"</p>
<p>"Really."</p>
<p>"Then tonight is the last day?"</p>
<p>"Yes, and it's also the last day with this city."</p>
<p>A feeling of nausea suddenly rose in my heart. I hurriedly looked for a spittoon. I was busy for a long time but still couldn't find it, so I wanted to open the window and spit outside, but he smiled and told me that the spittoon was beside him, but when I went over to spit, I knew he was deceiving me. There was no spittoon, he opened a very white handkerchief and told me to spit on it, but I finally broke free from his hand and spit out the window. And he also threw the cigarette butt out the window as if disappointed. I couldn't understand his heart at this time, why he needed something that humans hate.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry." I said, I sat on the table in front of him, "But why do you want this thing?"</p>
<p>"I like it."</p>
<p>"You like it?"</p>
<p>"Haha..." He laughed horribly again, "I have accepted many, many things that you hate..."</p>
<p>"However, I am just like you, there was a time when I was too absurd, I needed stimulation, turning day into night, and night into day, I almost sacrificed myself. When Alexandre Dumas the Younger wrote *La Dame aux Camélias*, he said that beside the ideal, there is also material life! Ideals and material things are ultimately two things that are too far apart. We cannot only be for ideals, and forget material things, but we cannot only be for material life."</p>
<p>"That's right!" He raised his head and agreed with my words, "Beside the ideal, there is also material life! So I am simply going to separate from this place."</p>
<p>"Where are you going?"</p>
<p>"The Great Rear Area! Why do you ask?"</p>
<p>"Oh!..."</p>
<p>We were silent again.</p>
<p>He listened to the rain outside the window, looked at his watch and said he was leaving, resolutely.</p>
<p>The rain was still heavy. He borrowed a raincoat from me, copied an address for me, and left.</p>
<p>It was already two fifteen when he left, and I fell asleep tiredly.</p>
<p>The next afternoon, when I came back from the office, the maid handed me a package. In addition to my raincoat, there were two letters attached. One was specifically for me. He thanked me for my sincere hospitality to him. He said that he left early this morning, and asked me to forward another letter.</p>
<p>Because I was too busy with work, I put the letter aside for more than twenty days. Later, I went to look for him at the address, but the person had gone to live in the countryside. I inquired again and again, but I was still confused. I have kept this letter until now, and it is still by my side. He wrote like this:</p>
<p>"X!</p>
<p>We are going to separate.</p>
<p>I used to tell you that life should be a little sloppy. Sloppiness may be pleasant, but now I have changed. I tell you; I have violated my philosophy, violated the philosophy needed by this society, I have become surprisingly serious beyond your expectations.</p>
<p>This place is too bad. I have decided to change the environment and go to a very far place to endure hardship. I am telling you this news. I waited for you, but you didn't come. Now I am gone. Is it strange to go? Maybe...</p>
<p>Don't you hate me? Okay, don't hate me, don't worry about this unconscious person, he only gave you a lot of troubles</p>
<p>I bless you</p>
<p>Health, X who is heartless"</p>
<p>This letter was written to his girlfriend, but the handwriting became more and more sloppy towards the end, making it impossible for me to read. However, what he said came true. Until now, it has been a year since the victory of the motherland, and people have returned from the rear, but his news is still silent. Will it really be as he said that he will never come back?</p>
<h3>Winter Days</h3>
<p>— Yang Lida</p>
<p>I love to see plum blossoms in the snow, in the clear winter mornings.</p>
<p>I love to depict bamboo in the wind, under the winter sun.</p>
<p>I love to hear the roaring pine trees, in the deep winter nights.</p>
<h3>Statue of a Saint</h3>
<p>— Vinci</p>
<p>Vinci (1452-1519) was not only a famous painter, but also an inventor, writer, astronomer, geographer, philosopher, mathematician, and even an architect, a true genius. The beauty and elegance of his sketch lines have been praised by critics as unprecedented. This work has all the strengths, and can be considered a representative work. (Lion)</p>
<h3>A Collection of Lyrics</h3>
<p>— Hu Mu</p>
<p>1. Rainbow</p>
<p>I remember under the lamp on autumn nights, Mom loved to tell stories about rainbows.</p>
<p>I always love to look at the colorful rainbow in the sky after the rain.</p>
<p>The rainbow, in the light blue sky, crosses the quiet wilderness like a big bridge.</p>
<p>This bridge of friendship unites my thoughts with hers. I often think of her when I see a rainbow, thinking of a group of friends who are walking far away for work and faith.</p>
<p>So, I close the white paper windows tightly every night, silently remembering the distance, and the poems I send from afar are born under my pen.</p>
<p>So, I fantasize about the fairy tales Mom told; she said that peace appears after the storm, and the rainbow appears in the blue sky, and then nature faces spring. That rainbow is a real bridge, passing my voice, laughter, to the other side; I look at the rainbow weather, and go out to watch with a cane, I sadly think of that beautiful rainbow, I miss that woman far away who is thinking of the rainbow.</p>
<p>2. Water Village</p>
<p>I have lived in the mountains for a long time, and I rarely see that bay of sparkling turquoise pond water. In the valley, although there are wildflowers, sunshine, and goat smells, in the valley there are also mountain mists, clouds, fog, frost and snow...</p>
<p>I am a young shepherd, but when I came to Jiangnan, I was infatuated with the poetic water chestnut pond! When the crows circle the trees on the embankment, when the sunset is drunk and reddened half the sky, a young girl, wearing a lotus-root-colored short shirt, sky-blue pants, one smile a dimple, one smile like a bay of flowing water...</p>
<p>They smell the fragrance of the sun, the fragrance of wildflowers, the fragrance of aquatic plants, and the fragrance of drifting hair.</p>
<p>I love that clear pond. When the wind moves the green willows, the water buffalo washes its heavy body in the pond. Then I want to ride a donkey across, remembering the girls who live by the pond, and I miss even more the working friends on those flower fields.</p>
<p>3. River Love</p>
<p>In spring, I love the turbulent, rolling river! At dawn, I love to learn to sing the boatman's song "On the Jialing River" by the riverbank. I miss a beautiful season, on a blue river, there are our working comrades pulling the tow rope with a "Hang Yu, Hang Yu" sound! China is like a broken boat, stranded on a shoal! ...</p>
<p>In spring, the river flows continuously to the east. I stand by the riverbank, sending a deep blessing to the friends by the river.</p>
<h3>An Inch of Land, An Inch of Blood 112</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>At this time, the half-moon was already sinking in the west. Tsurumi got out of the car and looked around. He saw that this place seemed to be a suburb, otherwise it was an extremely deserted section of Tokyo. The building in front of him looked like a large villa. The facade was in the form of a mansion, but passing through the mansion, it was a very large garden. The one-eyed gentleman left the rest of his entourage in the mansion, and led Tsurumi along the path, through the garden, to a palace-like house. Although it was late at night, before dawn, between two and three o'clock, several places in this house were still brightly lit; there were guards in the main hall.</p>
<p>When the one-eyed man led Tsurumi past the guards, he only nodded. The guards didn't pay attention, and didn't interrogate, which showed that he often came and went here. He settled Tsurumi in a small room on the left of the hall, and told him to wait a moment, smiled at him, and went out on his own. Tsurumi was left alone in this small room. Seeing that the one-eyed guy had left, he must be reporting to his superiors. There was probably a few minutes of delay, the time was quite leisurely. He didn't need to rush to see the contents of the cigarette case, and first appreciated the contents of this small room. He looked at the four walls and knew that this was a simple reception room, precisely the waiting room for small people or Shu officials to visit the big shots. The arrangement in the room was quite Chinese-style, at least it was trying its best to imitate the arrangement of the reception room of a Chinese big shot; some screen strips and calligraphy and paintings adorned the four walls, and in the cabinets and on the tables, there were complete sets of thread-bound and western-style books. Although the room was not big, there were more than a dozen chairs, probably a "cold bench" arrangement.</p>
<p>After Tsurumi looked around the small room, he picked a chair facing the window and sat down. He listened to see if there were any sounds outside. He thought that although he hadn't revealed his whereabouts at all, and shouldn't be so closely monitored, he couldn't be careless. So he took out his exquisite cigarette case generously, with his back to the window, and opened it seemingly unintentionally, taking out a cigarette. At the moment of leaving the cigarette case, he had already seen a small folded piece of paper pressed under the several cigarettes inside. When taking the cigarette, he still used the technique of performing magic, cleanly and neatly, and also clipped the small piece of paper in his hand.</p>
<p>This kind of note-passing trick was still an old-fashioned way of transmitting secrets thirty years ago. Pingzi was still using it at this time, which showed that it was not very clever, right? However, it also depends on what the nature of the message being transmitted is, whether it is worth using a more precise and scientific method; at the same time, Pingzi is a special member of the Black Dragon Society, and has also worked as a spy in England. She must have received special training. Regardless of her qualifications, regarding the method of transmitting messages, it must not be so naive. Perhaps it fits an old novel cliché, she is "skilled and bold," she believes that in this situation, this method is secret enough and won't be noticed. But why did she repeatedly tell Tsurumi to be careful with this cigarette case?</p>
<p>At this time, after Tsurumi took the small piece of paper in his hand from the cigarette case, he suddenly changed his mind and didn't want to open it in this "danger zone," so he immediately used a technique to hide it in his personal secret place. Just after hiding it, he suddenly thought that Pingzi temporarily paid so much attention to this thing, maybe it was extremely related to me, and if I looked at it now, I could have more preparation to deal with it? At the same time, maybe some curiosity was at play, so he decided to take the piece of paper out of the personal secret bag, and look at it before speaking.</p>
<p>After deciding, he borrowed the technique of lighting a cigarette, took out the small piece of paper, and also took out his personal notebook and pencil, as if he wanted to record something, and spread the small piece of paper just right on top, preparing to examine it carefully. Who knew that the piece of paper was the same as the paper in the notebook, without a single word or stroke, it was actually a blank piece of paper. He flipped it over and over, but there was nothing on it. At this time, Tsurumi thought about it, and couldn't help but laugh at himself. He had been messing around for a long time, but it turned out to be like this. He thought that Pingzi, this girl, was very mischievous, maybe she was deliberately playing a prank again.</p>

<h3>Publication</h3>
<p>— Shao Fu</p>
<p>I met a friend on the tram, and in our casual conversation, he asked me about the newspaper's circulation, how it was before the war. I told him the total was far exceeding pre-war levels. His question made me think about the progress made during the eight years of war. Taking newspapers as an example, whether in Shanghai, Nanjing, or other cities within the country, each newspaper generally has a higher circulation than before the war. This proves that education and culture are more widespread than before, and the people's need to understand news and current events has increased. This phenomenon is naturally gratifying.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the degree of gratification is ultimately limited, and within this limited degree of gratification, it is constantly subjected to blows and destruction. Looking ahead, one cannot help but feel a sudden sense of worry!</p>
<p>There are two examples to illustrate the seriousness of this blow:</p>
<p>First, considering the newspapers in Shanghai, almost all of their sales are within the city. Even the newspapers with nationwide reach and the best circulation numbers are no exception. Naturally, a newspaper should have more sales in its place of origin than in other areas, but if it becomes disproportionate, then there must be a problem. The problem lies in transportation and postage.</p>
<p>Second, looking at various periodicals and magazines, the total circulation has generally decreased compared to pre-war levels in the year since the victory. The reason is that the main distribution of various periodicals and magazines has always been in other areas. In other words, the number of readers in other areas has historically exceeded the number of readers in the city.</p>
<p>Traffic congestion is a blow, and skyrocketing postage is a form of destruction. How can we talk about cultural exchange? If a country does not use various methods to encourage cultural undertakings, it is already abandoning progress. If it turns around and destroys them, then the consequences are unimaginable.</p>
<p>The cultural and publishing sectors should unite and loudly call attention to this situation!</p>
<h3>Women's World</h3>
<p>— Wenhua</p>
<p>"My Utopia" A Visit</p>
<p>Last night before going to sleep, I ate a little too much melted cheese. After wrestling with my pillow for four rounds, I had to give up on sleep, turned on the light, and reached for the evening paper. On the first page, I read a news item that said, "Women will cast sixty percent of the votes in the next election."</p>
<p>"How about that?" I muttered, "Every time those girls get together on a plan, they always manage to take over everything and run things to suit themselves."</p>
<p>Suddenly, the print in front of me blurred as if a camera had lost focus; and I felt myself walking into a strange road. It looked like New York, but it was strangely altered.</p>
<p>In front of a building that seemed familiar, I saw a policeman standing on a small gold pedestal. He was six feet three inches tall, and his uniform looked like the grand finale of a Ziegfeld Follies show.</p>
<p>"What is this incredible building?" I asked him.</p>
<p>"This is the Grand Central Powder Room," he replied, "Worth thirty million. Every city has one like this."</p>
<p>Women in Power</p>
<p>I began to understand a little, so I asked, "Is it that the women are now in power and managing the country?"</p>
<p>"Not exactly," he told me, "Do you think a woman would elect another woman? But they only elect the men they like. Now it's Pank's second term as president."</p>
<p>"Did they drive out all the politicians?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Only the ugly ones. The camera-ready types—James Forrestal, Paul McNutt, Bernard Baruch, Eisenhower—are more powerful than ever. Say, let me see your marriage certificate."</p>
<p>"What's that?"</p>
<p>Marriage Certificate</p>
<p>"Every man has to carry one. It states your age, income, and chest size. If a man reaches thirty and isn't married, the government forces him to carry a baby. A lot of things have changed. Payment checks are always sent to the housewives; that way, it eliminates the middleman. Every husband has to shave as soon as he gets home from the office, and men with large appetites can only have bran with water to eat. Also, women don't have to kiss their husbands unless they want to."</p>
<p>"If a woman reaches twenty-nine," he continued, "they can burn her birth certificate. That way, no one can know her age. Six months out of the year are called June."</p>
<p>"The money might confuse you. The denominations of the new banknotes are: $0.98, $4.98, and $9.98. Change is the same way. But the ticket collector on the bus must accept the first coin a lady pulls out of her handbag, even if a useless badge is legal tender on trams and buses.</p>
<p>Various Adaptations</p>
<p>"Schools are teaching writing, reading, and the Lambeth Walk. Chocolate ice cream is sold in halves, so girls don't have to bite into it to see what's inside. The pound is required to be ten pounds lighter. And the mirrors are made to make fat, bloated women look trim."</p>
<p>"Goodbye, slave. Watch out when you cross the road!" he said, as he turned back to the traffic: "Those ladies passed a law allowing them to drive on both sides."</p>
<p>As I walked away, lost in thought, a beautiful pink sedan suddenly came out of nowhere. There was a sharp screech of brakes, and then everything was silent. I woke up to find my wife putting a cold bandage on my head and gently comforting me.</p>
<p>"I had the craziest dream, darling," I said. "I dreamed that women were managing everything to suit themselves. Can you imagine how ridiculous?"</p>
<p>"Of course, it's ridiculous," she agreed, "By the way, dear, my sister and her children are coming to stay with us for a month tomorrow, and I've prepared a comfortable little bed for you in the attic." (The End) (Translated from the November issue of "Reader's Digest")</p>
<p>Shanghai Cross-section</p>
<h3>The Organization of Beggars</h3>
<p>— Huang Jiamo</p>
<p>Zhang Fei on the Bridge</p>
<p>Pulling carts on the bridgeheads is a good gig for the little devils. There are quite a few bridges along the Suzhou Road in Shanghai. It is difficult for rickshaw pullers to drive across the curved bridges. In the past, there were only rickshaws, but now there are also tricycles. Tricycles often carry two passengers. At the beginning of climbing the bridge, the rickshaw pullers can no longer pedal the wheels, so they have to get off and push forward, but they still don't have enough strength. At this time, the veteran brothers, who are the beggar gangs or adult little devils, who are pre-arranged at the bridgehead, push from behind. Sometimes, these little devils obtain the consent of the passengers in advance before working hard at this obligatory task, but most of the time, they start working even when they don't quite have their consent. Once they push it to the bridgehead, the passengers have no choice but to fork over money. With a simple gesture, in two or three minutes, they can receive compensation. Before the war, it was a few copper coins, but now it takes a hundred-yuan bill to get anywhere. This type of cart-pushing profession is called "Zhang Fei pulling Zhuge Liang" by the gang members. It is abbreviated as "Zhang Fei on." This term seems a bit abrupt, but it is said to have a source. Zhuge Liang was accustomed to sitting in a Kongming cart, which needed people to push it. The reason for calling the passenger Zhuge Liang and calling themselves Zhang Fei is that the gang members admire the heroic Zhang Fei the most.</p>
<p>Each bridge is divided into two shifts, left and right, and each day and night is divided into three shifts in rotation. Each shift forms a small group of about three or four people. However, the bridge section belongs to the Uncle gangs. The Uncles who occupy the bridges do not need to do anything themselves. They only need to observe from the sidelines occasionally, while the little devils under their command do the work of "Zhang Fei." Each person in each shift must hand over all the money, and then distribute three or four tenths to the little devils. The Uncles can enjoy the salary and the profits are very considerable.</p>
<p>The bridge locations are divided into rich and poor, and the income varies greatly, but each Uncle who occupies a prime location on a bridge is absolutely unwilling to give it up easily. There were often disputes over bridges in the past, which was a terrible bloody battle, but the result could not be resolved, because even if the original owner failed, they often refused to give up. Soon after, they would still train new troops to come back for revenge. That slogan was similar to "recovering lost territory." Recently, this trend has become very popular. Each bridge has long been occupied by someone, and the invaders' conspiracy can never be realized.</p>
<p>If a down-on-their-luck, foreign-style beggar sees an opportunity and actually wants to automatically push a cart to earn money, it is impossible. At the very least, they will have to suffer a beating from the original gang of little devils. After all, where the profit lies, outsiders are not allowed to get involved.</p>

<h3>Let's Talk About "Misleading the Children"</h3>
<p>— Fang Cheng</p>
<p>What the Teacher Says</p>
<p>A few days ago, I read Mr. Shengjie's article "Misleading the Children" in this journal, which couldn't help but remind me of fragments of my past life.</p>
<p>Having given up the life of a chalk-wielding teacher long ago, I sat on a cold bench in a private middle school in this city for half a semester again last semester for the sake of friendship - actually, I stood for more than four hundred hours - and taught Chinese to three classes of high and junior high students. Nowadays, middle school students in general do not seem to have much interest in the subject of Chinese, especially the teaching materials in the textbooks, eighty or ninety percent of which are boring classical Chinese. Every time I teach a class, even if I talk eloquently and exhaust my tongue, there are very few students who can concentrate and listen attentively. Sometimes, when I stride onto the podium and open the textbook to prepare to explain it, naughty students will even stand up and ask me to tell them a few stories, which will really make you not know whether to laugh or cry. The most headache-inducing thing is the two hundred or so papers, which are either off-topic, nonsensical, or full of typos and unreadable. Although there are also works that can be recited after a little polishing, they are rare. You want to mark these papers, but you simply can't start. Sometimes, when I return the original paper for rewriting, the second submission is still "I don't know what it's talking about," which makes it impossible for you to revise it. At first, I thought this situation was the result of my own poor teaching, so I changed many teaching methods, but I still didn't get significant results. Therefore, a month before the end of the semester, when the headmaster asked me to help out again next semester, I politely declined. Taking into account the headmaster's feelings, he repeatedly tried to persuade me to stay, so I told him a joke:</p>
<p>The Scholar's Crime</p>
<p>"Once upon a time, there was a scholar who died and was summoned by the King of Hell for questioning. The scholar stepped into the Hall of Yama and saw the King of Hell questioning a robber, so he had to stand under the steps and wait quietly. After a while, the robber retreated with a smile, and it was said that he was declared innocent. The scholar thought that even robbers were spared, so he must be fine, so he strode up to the hall. When the King of Hell saw the scholar, he asked bluntly: 'What did you do before you died?' The scholar said, 'I was a teacher.' When the King of Hell heard this, he became angry and ordered the ox-headed and horse-faced demons to押 the scholar to the 'tongue-pulling' hell. The scholar was completely confused and shouted for injustice, saying: 'Your Majesty is too unfair! Robbers kill and loot, which is a heinous crime, yet they are acquitted. Scholars study and understand reason, are law-abiding, and have never committed any crimes. Why should they be subjected to this heavy punishment? May I ask Your Majesty, what crime has the scholar committed?' The King of Hell sneered and said: 'Don't you know?' As he spoke, he picked up a pen and drew a few strokes on the paper and threw it in front of the scholar. The scholar took a closer look and it turned out to be the four big characters 'misleading the children', so he bowed his head in silence and entered prison with the ghostly official and his clanging chains."</p>
<p>The headmaster listened and laughed at me, saying: "Are you afraid that you will also go to the tongue-pulling hell in the future?" I also smiled and replied: "That's not necessarily true, it's just that I've been teaching for half a year and haven't been able to teach any results, and the condemnation on my conscience is really too deep!"</p>
<p>This semester, I finally resigned from this position.</p>
<h3>Wonderful Hands</h3>
<p>— Yimin</p>
<p>Yesterday, after dinner, I took a walk in the alley and looked into the distance. I saw a man in short clothes and a felt hat running forward in a hurry. A small vendor at the alley entrance said that this was a pickpocket, so I quietly watched the development. I saw him walking next to a group of people, taking off his felt hat and putting it on his right arm, passing by the left side of the pedestrian, and his left hand stretched out from under the hat on his right arm into the pedestrian's pocket, and then stretched out again, and a wad of banknotes was already in his hand. His movements were agile and nimble, and the pedestrian was completely unaware. I was about to shout and wake the pedestrian, but the vendor next to me said, "Don't make a sound. They have a lot of power, a tight organization, and are connected. Outsiders who meddle in other people's business are sure to get into trouble." So I had to watch the pickpocket walk away. The vendor also said, "You should hurry up and chase the object of your attention because there is a territorial relationship. If he goes any further, he will not be able to infringe on the interests of his colleagues." I think the lower classes of Chinese society actually have such a tight organization and strictly abide by gang rules. The only pity is that they do not follow the right path. It is said that the last large-scale parade of pickpockets in the city not only failed to change their habits, but after they were released, they acted even more cautiously and intensified their efforts.</p>
<h3>American Workers' Working Hours - Only One Day Per Year</h3>
<p>— Jianhua</p>
<p>Someone asked an American professor: "How many working hours do workers in your country have? Are they working overtime?" Unexpectedly, the American professor replied: "American workers' working hours are only one day per year." This is how he calculated it:</p>
<p>One year is a total of 365 days.</p>
<p>Sleeping time, 8 hours per day, totaling 122 days.</p>
<p>Rest time, 8 hours per day, totaling 122 days.</p>
<p>Sundays off work, totaling 52 days.</p>
<p>Commemorative holidays, totaling 18 days. (America)</p>
<p>Eating time, 2 hours per day, totaling 32 days.</p>
<p>Annual holidays, totaling 18 days. (America)</p>
<p>He calculated it as if it were a serious matter, saying: "According to this calculation, isn't working time only one day? Right or not?"</p>
<p>News Figure</p>
<h3>Key Figure of the China Democratic League - Huang Yanpei</h3>
<p>— Ganlai</p>
<p>Mr. Huang Yanpei, a standing committee member of the China Democratic League who attended the Political Consultative Conference, is a vocational education expert. The long-standing and successful China Vocational Education Society and School were founded by him.</p>
<p>Mr. Huang was a Juren in the Renyin year. This year, he is sixty-nine years old. From the outside, who would have guessed that this burly, large, square-faced scholar is a scholar and key figure in a political party?</p>
<p>There are many widely circulated anecdotes about Huang's private life. More than ten years ago, he wore glasses and grew a beard. When he was approaching the age of seventy, his first wife died of illness, and he remarried. Instead, he shaved his beard cleanly, showing a face full of spring breeze, becoming younger.</p>
<p>He advocates vegetarianism. When his first wife, Ms. Wang Jiusi, was alive, she personally took charge of the cooking. It is said that she secretly used lard to cook the green vegetables and tofu, and mixed the clear soup with the juice of young chickens, which tasted particularly delicious. Mr. Huang did not know the truth, so whenever friends held vegetarian banquets, Huang often shook his head and could not swallow.</p>
<p>When Xu Guoliang was the director of the Shanghai Police Department, Huang was founding the China Vocational School. He went to the school every day to work. One day, after finishing his work and leaving the school, he suddenly had an urgent need to urinate, so he relieved himself near the bamboo fence at the school gate. A reckless policeman nearby, without asking the reason, slapped Mr. Huang a few times and cursed incessantly. Huang was humiliated and unwilling to accept it, so he silently memorized the policeman's symbol and told Xu the whole story by telephone. Xu immediately dismissed the policeman.</p>
<p>In the year when Mr. Huang was sixty years old, he suddenly suffered from appendicitis. Fortunately, he recovered after treatment, so he wrote a "Broken Intestines Collection" to commemorate it.</p>
<p>Mr. Huang is optimistic about everything. When talking and giving speeches, he often inserts humorous tones. During speeches, he likes to use the words "brothers". Although he speaks Mandarin, you can tell from the accent that it is the Pudong dialect.</p>
<p>He likes to travel and has been to various parts of China and Japan, Korea, the United States, the Philippines, Southeast Asia and other places. St. John's University awarded him an honorary doctorate in philosophy.</p>
<p>Some people call Mr. Huang Yanpei an "old boy", which is naturally very apt.</p>
