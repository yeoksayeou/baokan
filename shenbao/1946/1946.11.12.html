<p>〔中央社南京十一日電〕國民政府三十五年十一月十一日令，國民大曾改定於民國三十五年十一月十五日開會，此令。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十一日電〕國大決定延期三日，定十五日舉行開幕典禮。據聞（一）係循調人方面之商請，（二）因代表尙未到齊，經社會賢達代表王雲五，錢新之十一日干九時廿分赴主席官邸時努力之結果。政府對延期一事，於午夜鄭重發表明令，俾便周知。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京十一日電〕社會賢達轉達第三方面意見，請將國民大會開會日期延遲二三日，以等待各黨派開送名單，政府因其辭意甚爲懇切，且有許多代表尙在途中，故已接受此項建議，改於十五日開會。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十一日電〕社會賢達代表十一日盡最大努力，奔走和平，希望各黨派均能參加此制憲之國大。八時社會賢達，靑年黨，民盟代表在交行集議，對於請政府延期舉行國大一事，熱烈發表意見，最後決定請政府延至十二月一日，並擬定一函，由民盟張君勸等六人署名，推派社會賢達代表繆嘉銘，胡霖，錢新之，莫德惠往謁主席，談至十二時，政協秘書長雷震赴交行，首與羅隆基，莫德惠有所晤談。下午一時共黨代表周恩來，董必武，李維漢亦抵達，旋亦進行晤談。四時莫德惠等往謁主席，對國大延期再度建議，原定携往之函件因故改爲口頭陳述，同時更改爲延期三日，當時主席表示，此項意見甚佳，且盼莫等再作最後努力，旋彼等即返交行報吿正在開會之諸代表，因主席尙未作最後決定，復再度集會，九時二十分再推王雲五，錢新之晋謁主席，主席當允延期三日，彼等返後，即由胡，繆訪周恩來轉達此項消息。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十一日電〕國大代表全體，定十二日上午九時往謁國父陵寢，下午四時舉行預備會。</p>
<p>開幕禮臨時主席　公推蔣主席擔任</p>
<p>〔中央社南京十一日電〕國民大會籌備委員會秘書長洪蘭友，十一日下午四時假國大會堂茶會，招待到京各代表，共到一千餘人，關於國大開幕典禮中之臨時主席問題，洪氏於致詞中稱：籌委會曾簽請國民政府兩項意見，（一）請國府主席爲大會開幕典禮時之臨時主席，（二）在代表中推一年長者爲臨時主席，嗣經蔣主席　辭，願以國府主席之身份，出席開幕典禮，望各代表對此能有一共同之意見，至此，武肇煦，于斌，奚玉書，常宗會，陳紫機等，紛紛發表意見，結果一致表決，仍請國府蔣主席爲國民大會開幕典禮時之臨時主席，至於開幕典禮儀式中，究否需要代表致詞一問題，亦曾作熱烈討論，繼經大多數決定，開幕典禮議式中，須有代表致詞項目，其人選已公推由孔庚担任。</p>

<p>〔本報南京十一日電〕國大延期三日，張君勱，蔣勻田，靑年黨李璜，均於十一日夜車赴滬，張此去係爲民主社會黨之提出國大名單一事有所商洽。李璜赴滬亦係就商在滬靑年黨人士提國大名單事。至民盟是否可即提名單。據羅隆基十一日晚對記者稱，吾人認爲延期三日，乃一好的轉機，唯提名單之事，尙未考慮及之，然亦並非不提，希望延期之三日內能有所收獲，使國大在和平統一國結之情况下舉行，則民盟自亦提出名單，又彼等十二日仍繼續舉行會議。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十一日電〕政府代表孫科，吳鐵城，王世杰，雷震等，十一日下午四時應主席召見，往商國是，六時至宋子文寓邸晚餐，餐後赴孫科寓集議，十一時始畢。旋雷震再於十一時一刻訪莫德惠，通知非正式綜合會談十二日下午四時將在孫院長私邸再廣舉行。</p>

<p>〔中央社本市訊〕廣西國大代表，現任廣州大學校長王志遠，緬甸華僑國大代表曹汝匡，十一日下午五時連袂由粵乘機飛抵滬，即乘夜車轉京出席國大，行前對中央社記者述及對憲政與憲法之觀感。王氏稱：國大揭幕在即，政府決心還政於民，全國人民莫不歡欣鼓舞，同伸慶祝，希望各黨各派亦能如期參加，共同促進和平統一大局之實現。至於任何實行政協決議，吾人不願表示意見，因其與國大會議性質幷不相屬。憲草方面，吾人在粵曾由國大代表聯誼會粵分會全體代表詳細研討，已將紀錄整理完竣，準備提供大會商討。大體言之，五五憲草內容頗爲完善，因該憲草係根據國父遺敎中之三民主義五權憲法全部精神而製定，經過立法院三讀會議程序始通過，將來提交大會再綜合各方面及全體代表之意見，必能產生一部完善之中華民國憲法。而此部憲法，較英美先進國家之憲法，或尤爲進步。至於將來憲政實施後，吾人認爲首項注重者爲普及敎育問題，因民主政治基礎即在發展國民敎育，敎育與政治，經濟，三者互爲依輔，不可脫節。王氏並稱：一般社會人士嘗言「中國文盲太多」。本人以爲「盲」字用得不妥，因有文盲亦可有「武盲」，乃至有其他方面之若干「盲」，實際上所謂「文盲」皆係過去國家未能在普及敎育上下功夫，不能歸咎于不識字之個人，以「盲」字加以刺激，故今後必須將此二字，從速消滅，使人人均能受敎育。至於今後敎育重心，本人認爲必須注意兩點：（一）學校敎育與家庭敎育及社會敎育相配合。二，德，智，體三育平均發展，王氏幷附帶述及廣州大學二十年來之發展，現已完成文法，理工，商三學院，十二學系，最近擬將文法學院擴充設，俟晋京後，將向敎部有所請示。曹氏則稱：對於如何實施憲政一點，曹氏意見認爲首須有一完善之憲法，此一憲法，即將於本屆國民大會產生，憲法產生後全國上下均須一致奉行，不可例外，因憲政基礎即在厲行法治。</p>

<p>〔本報南京十一日電〕立委簡貫三，徐元誥等三十七人，十一日聯名向孫院長及魏副院長提出書而請求，請敦促中央對全體立委列爲國大代表一事，速予裁可。原文如下：「世界各國制訂憲法，其方式不外乎兩種：一爲將已完成之憲法草案提交人民複決，一爲組織懲法會議，議訂憲法。此次國大係專爲議憲召集，立院旣草擬憲法草案於前，今又奉令修改於後，本院同人實已負議憲責任之半，在邏輯上成爲專爲議憲之國大之先天性代表，同仁曾一再請求中央決定本院全體委員爲國民大會代表，始終未荷決定，今國民大會開會在即，敬請院長敦促中央，即日予以裁可，俾利制憲進行，無任迫切待命之至。」</p>

<p>〔本報南京十一日電〕非正式軍事三人會，於十一日上午十時在馬特使行館舉行，出席馬特使，政府代表兪大維（代表徐永昌），共產黨代表周恩來，及參謀總長陳誠，國府參軍皮宗敢，國防部第五廳郭副廳長汝槐，第三麗廳長許朗軒及共產黨代表團譯員張文晋亦列會，於十二時散會。會中政府代表已正式提山具體停戰辦法，共黨代表當表示，須請示延安後再行決定。此式會議尙未決定第二次會議日期，唯雙方如感需要時，隨時均可的定召集。</p>

<p>〔中央社南京十一日電〕政府頒布之停戰命令，業於十一日正午十二時起發生效力，但截至現在止，延安方面尙未對共軍發布停戰命令，記者特往訪某觀察家，叩詢意見，據稱：停止衝突，爲全國人民一致之要求，停止衝突以後。不但能减除人民痛苦，且在政治上必能發生良好影響，故此次政府所頒布之停戰令，無論從任何觀點看來，是必要的，惟此次停職命令係政府自動頒發，爲求得衝突能實際停止，故不能不與中共談判，希望巾共亦能命令其軍隊停止　　國軍，政府方面已通知馬帥　　中共代表周恩來氏，幷已於十一日下午舉行三人會議，非正式會商談停戰問題，至非正式三人小組之結果如何，尙不可知。按照過去規定停戰辦法，可依下列方式實施，第一，雙方軍隊就現地停止衝突，等待三人小組前往。第二，由三人會議規定雙方軍隊撤離地點。第三，如雙方有不同童之處，由三人小組決定，以上辦法係過云規定，目前自可照此辦理，惟延安方面是否對此能表同童，目前尙不可知，苟僅由政府軍隊單方停戰，而共軍仍不停止襲　國軍，則衝突難免不繼續發生也。</p>

<p>〔本報南京十一日電〕立法院十一日舉行臨時會議，於討論例案後，（例案討論情形見第二版休息一小時，七時續開會議，審議五五憲草修正案草案，由孫科主席，王寵惠，吳經熊列席。首由孫科致詞，說明憲草修訂經過，略謂，五五憲草修正案草案，係政協憲草審會所擬議，在渝開會時，曾提供若干修正意見，其後又由王憲惠，雷震及吳經熊等三人，就當時審查意見予以整理。主席近電本院，以國大召開在即，而制憲又爲該會唯一工作，指示本院對五五憲草修正案草案，迅加審議，俾供國大討論。</p>
<h3 id="c16">經過立法程序　共有兩種意見 <a href="#c16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>對修正案是否應經過立法程序，各方有兩種意見：一，認爲不必經立法程序，以十年前之五五憲草爲藍本即可；二，認爲應經過立法程序。蓋照第一種辦法，將來恐生問題，由於政治變遷，十年前之情形已與今日不同，當時國內情勢亦與目前相異，爲適應國內情勢，原草案須加相當修正，自須經過立法程序，應指出者，爲此修正案爲一案，而非兩案，主席即係採第二種主張者，特電本院就最後修正案完成立法程序。</p>
<h3 id="c17">定本星期以內完成全部工作 <a href="#c17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>主席前曾限本院於本月十五日前完成此　工作，現情勢已略有不同，時　亦可略爲鬆動，無論如何本星期丙將全部工作完成，時間旣較充分，自可從長討諭。淮立委中多數米參加修正工作，對經過不甚明瞭，因請王　憲等蒞會說明。詞畢，討論審議程序，是否先開一次全院審查會，再行分組審查，首由劉盥訓發言稱，五五憲草本院早經討論，並會諮詢各省意見，近一二年來一般人皆知之甚詳，今日之大變更，是否將使舉國人士懷疑，過去草擬憲法，皆以五權憲法爲本，以五權推行三民主義，而目前之修正案草案名爲三民主義而葉五權憲法於不顧，確成問題。孫科當答，此刻所討論者，爲程序問題，對內容問題請中止發言，劉猶慷慨陳詞最後主席停止劉氏發言，劉乃憤而退席。最後決議，定十三日上午九時舉行財·經·軍·外·法五委員會聯席審查會，由法制委會委員長林彬召集，屆時請王寵惠等報吿，再決定審查程序，會議至下午八時許始散。</p>

<p>先討論三一一次會議所餘各案，辦論最激烈者，爲經濟部工商輔導處組織條例，由法制委會委長林彬說明謂：此一機構所用職員極少，旦偏重技術，其對象亦僅爲民營工業之輔助，似應允予成立。陳顧遠等則表示不反對，認京滬與人爲經濟部所在地，在上述兩地設輔導處，似無必要，其他各建設廳，社會局，對輔導工作亦皆注意，並無再設機構必要。各委電對應稱爲「輔導處」抑維持原稱爲「督道處」，發言亦踴躍，大部反對用「督」字蓋如此無異走上管制老路。結果照審查案通過，仍稱「工商輔導處」。</p>
<p>修正使用牌照税法亦引起注意，决議：小汽車營業地每輛全年最高不得超過三萬元，大汽車不得超過五萬元，載货汽車同上，機器脚踏車不得超過五千一元，人力車不得超過五千元，但三輪車得提高至二分之一，自用者照營業者二分之一徵稅。</p>

<p>〔中央社南京十一日電〕立院十一日臨時會議通過之案件如次：（一）法制委員會報告審查修正監察院組織法第十一條條文案，（二）法制委員會報告審查國史館組織條例草案案，（三）法制委員會會同經濟委員會報告審查經濟部工商督導處組織條例草案案，（四）財政委員會報告審查屠宰税法草案案，（五）財政委員會報告審查修正營業牌照稅法草案案，（六）財政委員會報告審查修正使用牌照稅法草案案，（七）財政委員會報告審查修正筵席及娱樂稅法草案案，（八）財政委員會報告審查修正房捐條例草案案，（九）外交委員會會同法制委員會核復廢止敵國人處理條例案，（十）軍事委員會會同法制委員會報告審查戰略顧問委員會組織條例草案案，（十）（一）财政委員會會同經濟委员會報告審查修正货物稅條例條文草案案。以上（一）（七）（八）（十）（一）四案係經大會條正始獲通過又民法委員會會同國法委員會報告審查委員陳安等提議草訂陪審制度灶案案，審查結果，略以我國法治尙未充分發達，人民之法律智識亦未普及者，协此時勉强施行陪審制度，陪審員易受威脅利誘，操縱壟断，其結果不惟不能爲法官判撕事實上之輔助，法官反受其牽制拖果，故陪審制度似係利少弊多，照我國目前情况，一時尙難實行。該案經公決未予通赤，關於外交院員會會同法制院員會核復廢止敵主處置條例案，經核復結果，敵團人民處理條例现因日德兩國僑民大多遣回，義國已恢復邦交，术條例可予廢止，但敵產處理條例則因行政院頒布之「收復區敵僞產業處理辨法」未經立法程序，不能替代本條例，應函請政院即将該辦法條訂爲涤例草案，送本院審義後再核。</p>

<p>被告丁默邨，男，年四十四歲，湖南省常德縣人，住上海　園路一〇一〇號，充僞特工主任及僞浙江省長等職。</p>
<p>經偵查終結，認爲應行起訴。茲將犯罪事實及證據並所犯法條敘述如左。</p>
<p>（犯罪事實）</p>
<p>鼎丁默邨原係中國國民黨黨遇，充任前軍事委員會調查統計局第三處處長，民國二十七年八月間，該局奉命改組，第三處裁撤，丁默邨因之賦閑，遂於氣憤之餘，託詞南下，由漢轉港赴滬，勾結日寇，背判中　，而敵寇亦以丁逆默邨原係我中央特工人員，對於我特工部門組織情形各地所設情報　，知之甚詳，故予利用，以遂期以特工制特工之毒計。二十八年春，汪兆銘，陳公博，周佛海諸逆，受日寇卵翼，潛至上海，以「和平建國」，「中日親善」，「東亞共榮」爲號召，推行和平運動，丁默邨復受日寇指揮，參與活動，並經第六次僞中國國民黨全國代表大會推行爲僞中央執行委員會常務委員，及僞中央黨部社會部部長。在僞職期內，發表　　，　惑人心，復在滬組織僞特工總部於極司非而路七十六號·担任主任僞職，事事殘骸我中央地下工作人員，搜逮我愛國志士，破壞我清報機構，阻撓抗職，莫此爲甚。迨二十九年三月三十日，僞國民政府成立於南京，丁默邨則改任爲僞行政院社會部部長及僞中央政治委員會委員，參與僞政府最高國策及各種漢令條約之決議·三十年九月調任僞交通部部長，三十二年月調任僞社會福利部部長，三十四年一月兼任僞最高國防會議秘書長，同年三月又兼任僞政治保衛部副監，同年一月調任僞海港省省長兼僞駐杭綏靖主任，秉承敵僞意旨，推行政令奴役人民，並於是年夏與日寇特工中島信一，以敵軍敗象已露，仍思作歸後之困門，搜集散兵游勇，組織突擊總隊，企圖在浙東沿海一帶，於我盟軍登陸後，實行游擊戰，以牽制我盟軍戰力，勝利後，經前軍事委員會調查統計局誘捕押解偵查到院。</p>
<p>（二）證據並所犯法條</p>
<p>本案被告丁默邨，對於担任僞特工總部主任，參加僞國民政府，歷任中央執行委員會常務委員，中央黨部社會部部長，行政院社會部部長，中央政治委員會委員，交通部部長，社會福利部部長最高國防會議秘書長，政保衛部副監及浙江省洚長兼駐杭綏靖主任等僞職，迭據自白不　，參以調寧之僞行政公報，有被告以僞部長職　出席之各種會議錄，曁昭和十七年出版僞華中現勢之記載，及僞國民政府還都紀念冊，登載被告之各篇演詞，均與其自白吻合，事實極爲翼下之特務機構，僞國民政府係敵國日本製造之傀儡組織，均以破壞我國抗戰國策，及顛覆我中央政府爲唯一之的，被告原係中國國民黨黨民，曾任中央高級公務人員，於抗戰情形逆轉，千鈞一髮之際，竟　詞出走，背誓附逆，通敵謀著，担任敵僞特工及僞政府要職，殘害我中央地下工作人員，推行敵僞政令，减削我抗戰力量，此不獨有軍事委員會調查統計局之代電可資覆按，並經另案，被告胡均鶴歷歷供述，足以證明，而其於三十三年發表歲首感言，又有謂：「復與中華，保衛東亞，不是徒然的樂觀所能實現的，必須以鐵和血去換·我們　　　　　　，雖曾投下許多人力和物力，但並不能認爲滿足，　先　　的軍隊還沒有　到　友軍　肩作戰的力量，一年以來，政府之積極整軍，建軍，加緊　練青少年，無非爲駢肩作劄，擊滅英美，貫澈「大東亞戰爭」的準備，希望國人都能理解這點。我們多有一分力量，復興中華，多有一分實現的希望，我們多投一分力量，「大東亞戰爭」多有一分勝利的把握，惟有「大東亞戰爭」全面勝利，整個東亞民族才能獲得大解放。我們要在這種理解下共同努力」等語。其他類此皆謬之詞，尙不勝枚舉，是其通敵謀叛之逆跡，已屬昭彰。况其於三十四年夏，以敵寇敗象已臻顯露之際，竟猶勾結日寇特工中島信一，陰謀計劃組織突擊總隊，企圖於我盟軍在浙東沿海一帶登陸以後，實行游擊戰牽制盟軍戰力，延緩敵寇崩潰之期，欲陷我戰區民衆於水深火熱之中。此雖訊據被告矢口否承，但參以中島信一在戰犯軍事法庭之供述，並陳恭　向軍統局之報告，事實至爲明確，斷非被告空言所能狡卸就此而論，其罪大惡極，尤無可這。雖據被告供稱：（一）參加僞組織係受敵僞脅迫，但心猶內向，（二）被告於三十一年春即託人代向中央自首以明心跡；（三）曾與中央軍政沁局暗通消息，設立秘密電台，供給軍團事情報整頓僞軍配合國軍，以圖反攻，營救中央地下工作人員，及協助中央發展渝陷區文化與黨務；（四）作職期內，保全郵權，維持通郵通匯改進公路，革除交通腐敗黑暗，力做社會福利工作，减輕　　民間疾苦，儲育農業人才，造福農村及掃蕩奸匪安定地方：（五）自日寇投投降後，被告即遵中央意旨，維持浙江淪陷區及滬杭沿綫一帶之治安，迨國軍進駐杭垣，即將所屬全部兵權交與中央接管，不無微功等語，執爲免現之辯解。然查（一）其所謂受敵僞脅迫一節，不惟純屬空言，無從採信，且先後繼續充任僞職達六載有奇，其間又復更調要職多次，並未潔身引退，以明心跡，其非出於被近灼然可見，（二）被告自附逆後，早經最高法院檢察署於二十八年十月二日明令通緝有案，從使被告於三十一年春曾託人代身中央自首，然核與自首須在犯罪發覺自動投案而受審判之條件不符，即未可據爲减累敵寇，主持特工殘害志士，反戰親日，背叛中央，罪跡昭彰，法無可恕，縱嗣後曾與中央軍政當局有所聯緊，及營救地下工作人員等情，亦係鑒於太平洋戰事爆發以後，國際情勢顯對日寇不利，無非預留在步，希圖掩飾前愆，何能以此作爲有利之證明而邀宥减。（四）被告所謂在僞職期內，曾經維持郵匯，改進路政，穩定治安各節，微論，空言無憑，即令果有其事，亦係僞職內應盡之職現，島可能此爲邀功？至其所爲有利於人民各種福利之事項，雖據　列多端，然查是否實在，尙滋疑義，縱使非盧，亦不過偶施小惠於順民，安足以小惠而蔽其大辜？（五）查被告在日寇投降後，曾經維持地方治安，協助中央接收，並交出所屬全部兵權，固經軍事委員會調查統計局於移送書中載明屬實，無非因日寇已經降服，僞組織失其憑藉，被告鑒於大勢已去，不得不俯首從命，有何功績之可言！總綱以上各種辯解，均係砌詞掩飾，希圖减免罪現，殊無可採，核其行爲，實犯懲治漢奸條件第二條第一項第一款之罪，爰依特種刑事案件訴訟條例第一條，刑事訴訟法第二百三十條第一項，提直公訴，相應送請依法審判。</p>
<h3 id="c40">社論　加倍努力完成　國父遺忘 <a href="#c40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>在國内政局是一個歷史關頭的今日，我们又逢到了國父的誕辰。對於這位民族领袖，我們的國父的誕生，及其一生的奮鬥，我們盯衡今日的局勢，感觸多端，萬語千言，真不知從何說起。田父生前所領導的民族革命，是三民主羲的革命；由於領導有方，志士粉起，卒顛覆了滿清，創建了民國，完成了三民主義民族革命的初步。其俊封建餘孽作祟，又形成了軍閥割據的局面，辛亥革命的前功，幾乎盡棄於一旦，幸賴我國父的奮鬥，重新又激起了國民革命的高潮，與殘餘封建勢力，展開劇烈的搏鬥。到了民國十三年秋，北方的局勢一變，國父爲實现和平統一促進民主建國，無數舊都，不幸竟以勞疾逝世，全國人民顿然失去了他們的領袖。彌留之際，猶殷殷關心國事，囑付我們要與以平等待我們的民族，共同奮鬥，要廢除不平等條钓，要召開國民仁義。今主席繼承國父遗志，旣排除了國内的殘餘封建势力，又領導我民族，作抗日的鬥争，而獲得了勝利，並且已廢除了不平等條約，已舆英美等國重新訂立了不等的新約。賴我主席的英明領導，國父遣嘱中所吩咐我們的，如今多已一一實出了。我們感謝全能上主的安排，國父所未完成的大業，能有這樣一個賢明的領袖，如蒋主席者，将它們一一變爲事實。今日逢到國父誕辰，我們謹以此如告國父在天之靈。</p>
<p>今天又是我們民放歷史上的一個重要開關，再番延期决定今日舉行的國民大會又再延期到十五日舉行了。國大的召開，本應早己實现，祇因日本军閥對我的加緊侵略，終之抗戰爆發，於是遷延了下來。共時我國正與敵人苦戰，而若干方面人士却堅主召開國大，我主席爲尊重各方意見，於是有一年内召開國大之諾言。在政府還政於民，實行憲政，本爲旣定方针。共黨及若千方面人士旣有召開國大之要求，在戰事好轉的情势下，自無不樂舆接受。其俊日本乞降，政府還都，又展至本年五月。在此時期，政府爲貫撤和年統一之志，选與各黨派剴切洽商，再三要求如期提出國府委員與國大代表名單，俾改組國府與召開國大，皆得如期燴行，乃遷延至四月二十五日，共黨猶拒絕提名，遂又不得不另行展期，我政府乃於七月四日宣布國大改期於十一月十二日召開。國大的召開到冷日，除因不可抗拒的對外戰事外，主要是由共黨的拖宕，故意延阻，事至明顯。到了最近，若干方面所要求的停戰命令，亦經以政府極大的忍讓頒發了。而本己决定在國父誕辰的今天正式舉行開幕禮的，又再作最後的延期，延至本月十五日舉行。</p>
<p>今日我們所需要的是和平統一，民主建設；國大的召開應該是和平統一的表现，民主建設的開端。民國十三年之際，國父爲了和平柱一，不借以積勞成病之身遠去舊京，這種犧牲和無我精砷·應該感動每個中國人民。我們今日所需要的亦是犧牲和無我，各黛各派以及無黨無派的人士均應捐棄一黛一派或一己之私，來共同參加這代表人民公意的國民大會；庶幾我國家的根本大法能够得到全民的通過，将来付諸實施，走上憲政常軌，可永杜國内政治的紛争。此次國民大舍代表有循區域及職業選舉合法產生，又由國府道接遴選，原可代表一般國民公意；但我們所殷切期望的，即各黨各派及無黨派人士亦能參加，共謀國事。</p>
<p>圈大的召開在制憲，制憲之後，就有行憲。國父所遣留給我們的三民主羲已不是一黨之私，而是中國之公的了。所以這次憲法的制定，應該爲三民主義精砷之具體我现。權能學說以及五權憲政的规模，應該在這次制定的憲法中有明確的規定，其有背於三汉主義之精神者應擯棄之。這樣憲法制定了以後，将来實行、在政府可以償其還政於民的宿願，爲中國走上了民主政治的大道。而在今天·我們尤其應該以加倍努力完成彼發揚國父的遗忘，來紀念國父。</p>

<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎十一日電〕政界觀察界談稱：昨日普選共黨勝利之主要原因，乃在右派各黨內部之分裂，右派分成許多小黨，因此無一黨所得票數，足與共黨抗衡。人民共和黨在上屆制憲議會選舉時，勢力原在共黨之上，但旋因戴高樂派之脫輻，失去大批擁護者，力量因而减弱。社會黨則分爲左右兩派，右派加人較爲溫和之黨派，包括人民共和黨在內；左派則加入左派聯合黨，因此社會黨日就式微。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎十一日電〕內政部今晚公布新講會選舉正式數字如下：（一）「選民人數」法國本土登記者二千五百八十三萬人，投票者一千九百五十七萬八千人，有效票數一千九百廿一萬六千票。（二）「各大黨所得票數」共黨五百卅五萬一千票，人民共和黨四百九十八萬八千票，社會黨三百四十三萬三千票，戴高樂同盟五十八萬五千票，獨立共和黨四十六萬二千票，左派聯合黨廿六萬五千栗，農民黨廿萬零七千票。（三）「本土及北非阿爾熱利亞屬地各大黨議員席决分配」共黨一六四席，人民共和黨一六〇席，社會黨九三席，急進黨四二席，右派各黨三六席，獨立共和黨二三席，戴高樂派九席。</p>
<p>〔聯合社巴黎十一日電〕法國於星期日舉行議會選舉，共然根據所獲票數，現可派出總理。此間有資格覜察家今日預料：共黨將推派陶萊士出任此職，惟陶氏殆必將遭其他各黨之一致反對。</p>

<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎十一日電〕法國昨日普選，共黨雖獲勝，但實力依然由各大黨分散。新閣殆將採取多黨制，與法國解放以來之三黨內閣制相似。共黨發言人龐德昨晚向報界稱：「共黨準備負起責任」。政界觀察家則以爲此言出之尙早，因在聯合內閣之中，共黨未易推行其政綱。要之，新政府之誕生爲期尙有三月，在此期間局勢變化甚多，尤其是國會第二院之咨政院將於本月廿四日選舉，彼時之形勢或將更爲微妙也。</p>

<p>〔法國新聞社東京十一日電〕日本地方參議會選舉及咨政院（代替舊貴族院）選舉期近，各黨加緊活動。自由與進步兩大黨之合併，殆已完成，但尙有少數問題須待解決，何人將出任新黨領袖，即爲問題之一。自由黨對推舉領袖，猶豫不前，首相吉田（自由黨總裁）準備與前首相幣原（進步黨總裁）成立諒解，但自由黨總部仍受前總裁鳩山之影響。鳩山雖被麥帥罷黜，但其殘勢力猶存，而幣原與鳩山間之關係，仍不見佳。另一方面，社會黨內部缺乏團結，其眞正力量在其對工人階級之影響，工人大衆現已組織工會。社會黨在未來選舉中，具有增强本身實力之種種機會。社會黨與共產黨目前並無成立人民陣綫可能。</p>

<p>上海港碼頭倉庫偸竊貨物，勒索貼力之風，已引起中外客商之責難，及政府常局之注意，新近成立之上海港務整理委員會，對此已一再商討，議定辦法，嚴格執行，以資整頓。據國營招商局總經理徐學禹談：招商局自去年復員以來，對於碼頭倉庫風氣秩序之整頓，即經下定決心，努力去做，惟以積習太深，尙未能收得預期之結果，今後仍當繼續努力，以期澈底革除數十年來之惡習，而樹立新風氣。又據徐氏稱：上海碼頭秩序之壞，由於過去社會惡勢力之包辦碼頭制度，此種惡勢力或以威逼，或以利誘，攬包一碼頭裝卸地位之後，即視爲一已之地盤，對客商則濫施勒索，對力伕則盡量剝削，彼則不勞而獲，坐享鉅利，故往往爲爭奪地盤，不惜使用種種卑劣手段，甚至械鬥流血，亦在所不惜。本局去年遷滬辦公之後，即決定首先廢除包辦制，採用監工制，目的在使眞正出力流汗之力伕、與本局發生直接關係，而能獲得其全部應得之力資，以免包工從中剝削，藉以提高力伕之待遇，而增進其工作效率及服務操守。一年以來，雖略見成效，然而過去之積習太深，力伕之知識太漢，往往監工制不久又形同包工制，種種流弊，隨之而生。本局對於各碼頭之監工，因有上項弊　而予斥換者、已有多起。各碼頭負實員工，經査明與監工勾結舞弊者亦均立即撤職，決不稍事寬容。今後本局自身自當一本初衷，儘量努力改進，同時亦盼港務整理委員會切實執行其決議，尤望社會各界多協助，對於本局各碼頭，上至負責人員，下至裝卸力伕，如有不照本局規定，任意勒索或營私舞弊者，儘量作負責之檢舉，取具確實證據，通知本局，本局決當嚴辦。並負責保障舉發人之權益，蓋必須有關之各方面協力合作，始能收效，而使此種惡勢力無所施技，終至絕跡也。再則貼力一層，究其由來，最初實由於客商爲欲爭先提貨，自動於規定力資之外加給，以後遂習以爲例，非此不可，爲此本局更切盼客商，嗣後務必按照本局規定付給，萬勿因貪圖一時便利，自啓惡例。</p>

<p>吳氏談及東北之紡織事業，首言棉紡工業。九一八前，僅國人經營之奉天紗廠一家。後又有營口紗廠之設。惟先後均遭日人收買歸併。迄目前爲止，東北各省共有大小棉紡工廠十一家，分佈地點，計瀋陽四家，大連附近三家，遼陽，營口，錦州，安東等地各一家，共有紗錠的五十五萬錠。瀋陽四廠，共有紗錠十六萬錠。一廠設備，已被蘇軍搬運殆盡。其餘三廠設備，先遭蘇軍搬運，次遭當地浪人搜劫，末又遭大火焚燬，現僅殘留少許布機。該四廠現正由東于北生產管理局整理中。大連三廠，共有紗錠廿二萬錠。破壞情形不嚴重，實係東北紡織事業精華所在，惟現仍在蘇軍掌握中。紡建公司所接收者，有遼陽，營口，錦州，安東各廠。遼陽，營口兩廠，均曾遭蘇軍及共軍八路軍兩度光顧，致物料及重要零件，均有搬動。遼陽一廠，有紗錠七萬八千錠，布機一〇四五台。現已開工二錠。營口一廠，有紗錠五萬五千錠，在機一五〇〇台。現已開足二萬錠。錦州一廠，有紗錠五萬一千錠，布機一二〇〇台，且有完備之印染廠設備。該廠機件爲一九三八年之豐田式，極爲新頴，現已開足一萬五千錠。安東一廠，有紗錠一萬六千錠。現安東收復伊始，聞共軍尙不及將該廠破壞，紡建已派人前往接收，惟詳情尙未報到。故總計東北各省之十一廠，總共紗錠五十五萬錠，目前能確定之紗錠運轉數，恐即紡建公司所接收各廠之五萬五千錠。</p>
<p>產棉量足以自給</p>
<p>次言東北之植棉情形。日人以發展工業之精神，發展農業，値得一談。九一八以前，東北本不植棉。惟自日人强佔東北後，即積極計劃植棉。迄去年日本屈膝時止，已能年產八十萬市担，足敷東北五十五萬紗錠六成之原料。日人計劃，不出三年，將增產至一百五十萬市担，俾使東北之原棉自足自給。日人推廣棉花之方策，經濟政治之力量，兼籌並施。東北產棉區，共設大規模之軋花廠十八家。所有植棉之面積，與夫每畝應產原棉之數量，日人均預爲計算。所產籽花，均交軋花廠收購。籽花軋就後，良種留待翌年播種，劣種備爲軋油之用。故出花品種僅二。一爲關農一號美棉種，產量佔百分之九十。一爲遼陽一號棉稱，產量的佔百分之十。前者因棉花絲毛不長，故成熟較早，每年產量亦豐，皮花產量亦多，故大量播種繁殖。惟日人對植棉不能達預期之目的者，處置殊爲苛刻。往往澳取棉農衣襖中之陳舊棉花以代之。最後，日人發明用木漿製造之人造織維，以替代原棉。現安東一廠，日可產人造纖維十萬噸。惟此項代用品，成本太高，且不及原棉之經用。</p>
<p>年產蔴十三萬噸</p>
<p>東北之蔴織工業，其重要性僅次於棉舫工業。現共有蘇蔴織廠五家。分佈地點，計遼陽一廠，現由生產局接辦，該廠損失不大。瀋陽二廠，由軍政部接辦。長春一廠，情形不明。戰時東北之軍用蔴袋，均取給於該五廠。原料方面，有靑蔴亞蔴等。日人强迫種蔴，故東北每年產蔴量達十三萬噸　毛織工廠，共有四家。瀋陽二廠，大部機器，已遭蘇軍搬走。錦州一廠，現由軍政部接辦。哈爾濱兩廠，情形不明。四廠共有毛紡錠一萬六七千錠。東北毛羊共三百七十萬頭，年可產羊毛七萬噸。</p>
<p>柞蠶絲工業，以安東一地爲最發達，年可產蠶約十萬顆。</p>
<p>衣着問題最嚴重</p>
<p>據吳氏觀察所得，東北之食衣住三大問題，目前當以衣着問題最爲嚴重。過去因日人管制棉布過嚴，所有棉布，幾掃數供給軍用。故目前東北布價，較關內的高出一二成。紡建公司現正加速全部接收工廠之開工率，以增加紗布之生產。同時發動南方紗布北遝，以濟眉急。又爲提倡植棉運動計，凡以棉花售予紡建公司者，當以平價紗布交換配售，以增加棉花之收購量。</p>
<p>全國原棉生產量</p>
<p>再次言全國原棉之生產，運輸，及收購情形。吳氏稱：照預定估計，全國本年原棉之生產量，可達六百廿萬市擔。茲以隴海·平漢兩路沿綫氣候良佳，故產量可增達七百萬市擔。據調查所得：東北一地，本季約產卅五萬市擔。西安的產六十五萬市擔。河南的產六十萬市擔。河北的產一百八十萬市擔。</p>
<p>言棉花品質，以陝西爲最佳。該地所產半數以上，可供紡四十二支紗。河南所產，可紡卅二支紗。東北平津一帶所產，可紡廿支紗。河北所產，品質最差，僅可紡十二支紗。各地棉花，均有摻什情形。吳氏深望政府當局，設法檢査取締。否則原棉品質必致日形低落。</p>
<h3 id="c105">收購棉花困難重重 <a href="#c105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>至棉花之收購數量，吳氏認爲未許樂觀。揆厥原因：（一）運輸困難，隴海路交通阻滯。（二）銀根緊縮，匯兌困難。（三）缺乏打包設備。（四）棉農自身之耗棉量，亦殊可觀。總計七百萬市擔棉花，棉農自身至少消費四百萬市擔。其餘一百餘萬市擔，則因交通不便，而將遭擱置。可能運達各廠應用者，不過二百萬市擔耳。</p>
<p>吳氏最後結語稱：欲解決我國紡織事業之種種問題，首在求全國軍事衝突早日停止。設一旦和平實現，則三年內我國之產棉量，決可自足自給。此舉非惟足以復興農村經濟，且可繁榮我國之紡織工業。</p>

<p>〔本報特寫〕在林森　路興復興西路交又的地方，有一幢尖頂紅牆的二層樓小洋房，圍牆的鐵門半開半掩，如吳不是門旁掛着一塊長長的黑字銅牌，恐怕誰也不會想到這裏面是藏着圖書雜誌十五萬餘卷的「鴻英圖書館」。對於這一個圖書館，相信大多數市民也許從來沒有注意過它的存在，最大原因想來是由於地址比較偏僻的緣故。可是追溯起它的歷史來，却已在十五年以上了。　現在的常務董事也就是最初的發起人黃炎培氏，在民國十三年的時候，他與沈信卿，袁觀瀾等組織甲子社，工作爲選輯人羣文化的紀述，名爲「人文類輯」。至十八年，由錢新之，徐靜仁籌募經費，於史料以外，兼編期刊索引，人文月刊，有關叢書並且籌備圖書館。二十年將「甲子社」正名爲「人文社」。至二十一年始得葉鴻英先生捐助五十萬元，除以十萬元撥辦鄕村小學外，餘下四十萬元就作爲圖書館基金，租到林森路現址作爲館所，這就是「鴻英圖書館」成立的起始。</p>
<p>史料選藏豐富</p>
<p>十五萬餘冊的收藏中，圖書約五萬餘册，維誌十五萬餘册，另外有報紙四十九種。圖書的性質比較徧重在學術方面，尤以中外史地及地方雜誌等最爲完備。雜誌與報紙收羅齊全，從淸末起至民國十三年前後的大抵完整，而最寳貴的還是史料選藏的豐富，從民元起至二十九年止各各種報紙上的種種史料都經過選輯，剪貼，編審，分門別類的裝訂整理，共有三千餘册，約一百七十六萬餘件之多。</p>
<p>新書比較缺乏</p>
<p>新書的比較缺少，以及近數年資料的缺如，正可以說明抗戰以來文化事業所遭受的磨難。在淪陷期間，敵人亦曾光臨過，幸好祗沒收去了一千餘册所謂含有抗日思想的書籍，餘者尙得保存，但是由於物價高漲，通貨貶値，基金逐漸枯竭；再加之環境惡劣，工作自然不免停頓。勝利以後雖經黃氏向各方籌募到的近二千萬元，但在日長夜大之物價下，亦僅能維持現狀而已。</p>
<p>每天閱覽人數</p>
<p>現在每天到館閱覽的人數平均祗四十人左右，以找尋資料的各大學學生爲多。每人收一百元的閱覽費，開放時間爲上午九時至十二時，下午一時半至五時，地址雖然偏僻了一些，環境却是非常淸靜。</p>
<p>「人文社」仍在不斷地求事業的推進，他們始終希望能建築一個規模較大的圖書館館址，擴大圖書雜誌等設備，並積極繼續從事史料索引出版等工作，以求對於社會有更大的貢獻。但是這一切少不了經費，他們已在開始一個初步目標二億元的籌募運動，希望上海的有錢人士都能够熱心的來扶植這一個已具有相當規模的文化事業。</p>

<p>長城內外（一）　察晉綏視察記  本報特派員杭舟　　由京飛張垣　　北方的工業的都市—張垣，在被共產黨竊踞的時代，是共黨在關內的唯一大城，其地位更當於董蘇的延安。張垣被國軍收復廿天後，巾外記者視察團一行廿二人，由中宣部國際宣傳處處長曾虛白，國防部新聞局副局長卿汝楫率領，於十月卅一日晨乘空連大隊C—47型294號專機，自京明故宮機塲起飛。那天早晨有霧，到九時許才散開。九時三刻，專機飛離了大地，　着北方的寒流前進。渦北平以後，儘見叢山峻嶺，氣候有了顯着的不同，飛機如航行在彼濤起伏的海洋裏，一上一下，乘坐的人都感到頭暈，想吐。但歷時不久，飛機已在下降，下午四時十分到達了目的地。　　張垣機塲上咆哮的朔風，首先歡迎這批南方的來客。每個人不辨打了幾個寒噤。我們乘了來接的大卡車馳赴招待所—察哈爾大飯店。這飯店建築於民廿八年，有着一段滄桑，正像這城市和這城市異的居民所經歷的一樣，它已經三易共主：在日軍佔據時，爲僞蒙疆政府的「中央飯店」；共產黨來了，改稱爲「解放飯店一；國軍收復張垣，才改稱今名。三天以前，這飯店還是破破爛燜，陳設不全；一天以前，還沒有電燈；而我們到了之後，這飯店已經煥然一新。被損害的張垣，入晚是漆黑一片，僅僅傅作義將軍的長官部與車站有由柴油機發電的電燈發出奇異的光彩；現在，察哈爾大飯店亦有了電燈，並且在第二天還有了暖氣，這可見傅作義將軍的好客。　　當晚，晋陝綏邊區副總司令，張垣警備司令兼暫三軍軍長，新任綏遠省政府主席的董其武將軍舉行了一次記者招待會，報吿集寗會戰，解謝大同，收復張垣經過。爲了軍務繁冗，他尙未決定赴綏接事的日期。招待會後，我們赴張家口大戲院參與慶祝蔣主席六秩壽誕的晚會，並與傳作義氏首次會面。這晚會別開生面，禮堂遍燃壽燭，壽桃，壽糕高聳在主席台上，台下是一批虔誠的盡力與冰凍的北方的將士，傅作　氏致詞，喩蔣主席的生，就是國家民族的生。　　新的長城　　步由張垣火境門，仰首一望，赫然四個大字：「大好河山」！我默默望着它很久，心中一陣辛　。在這四個字的兩側，便是連綿如山脈的萬里長城。立長城之　，極目四望，我遐想到中古時代人民防禦外侮的情形。那時候　　毒彈　　共軍三五八旅於九月二日在大同車站鍋爐附近所投，幸未爆炸。（特派員杭舟寄）所謂的敵人，在今天已成爲自家人了；但二千多年以後的長城，却仍然在一種陰靎的氣氛巾成爲我們國防的前哨，並正演出着自相殘殺的悲劇，我感嘆到人類的進步實在有限！顯然的，由於科學進步，長城在國防上已失去它重大的意義；然而，在艱苦的奮鬥的歲月中，新的長城正在建立起來。　　傳作義將車和他領導的轉戰十餘年的忠勇的軍隊，在北方人民的心目中是被視爲新的長城的。如果注意到近廿年中國軍事的變遷，傅作義三個字在人們的　中必有深刻的印象。抗戰八年中，他堅强不屈地在北方的原野與日軍周旋，給矛無情的打擊，克盡厥職。抗戰勝利後，他在奉命接收的途中，遭遇到蓄志叛亂的共軍無數次的裝擊。他爲了和平統一，一展撤退了數百里。而是，忍耐有一定的盡頭，他在受到人民的要求與他部下由於憤慨而對他的責備之後，開始自衛反擊。去年堅守綏包之役，今年集寗。大同，張垣之捷，在華北的命運上是有決定性的事件。由於他的勝利，華北千百萬人民免陷於共產黨「鬥爭」，「情算」的火炕　　他顯然不是一個平凡的軍人。他除了具有卓越的軍事指揮天才外，並具有淸新而正確的政治頭腦。他的「告中共人士書」與「致毛澤東電」，已成爲歷史性的文件。他在「吿中共人士書」屯說：「急於復工的工人，想種地的農民，想恢復交通和平貿易的商人，想過安定生活的小市民，小資產階級，學生，民族工業家，民族資本家，都和你們對立起來，爲爭取和平，統一，民主，結成了一倏陣綫，試問你們的革命茲礎在那裏」？這篇文吿發表於揮軍東進解救大同之國時，不啻給中共人士的精神上投下一顆炸彈。集寗戰後，他致毛澤東電中，又指出中共根本失敗之所在：「政府若干缺點所影響於人民生活的，較之你們破壞交通，窮兵　武所加給人民的苦難和死亡，簡直是上千萬倍之比。這還不現實嗎？還不明白嗎？你呌人民如何同情你們？擁護你們？」　　十一月一日晚，僅氏於歡宴中外記者團席上，更充分發揮了他的精闢的見解。他說：「今天共產黨的前途，應該靠政治，不應該靠武力。靠武力，不但武力失敗，而且要影響到政治的全盤失敗。共產黨巾一部份靑年，是爲抗戰而參加的，有熱情，能堅苦，研究技術，耐心工作，如果把這些長處，用在政治競賽上，用在建國事業上，都可以得到最好的效果，也可以創造遠大的前途。我自己用理智爲共產黨設想，以和平商談，實現國家和平，統一，民主，雜共產黨今天最正確的道路。」但如果共產黨不要理智怎麼樣呢？他發表了如下的預言：「共產黨如果眞要分裂，真要另立政府，他的幹部就要散。——那些爲抗戰而參加共產黨的靑年，一定會表示他們的願望」。　　從日常生活中去看傅氏，便會發現他的成功不是偶然的。他今年五十二歲，山西榮河縣人，保定軍校五期生。從當排長起，做到司令長官和省主席，他的生活似乎沒有多大的改變。在張垣，我每天看見他只穿了一套黃棉軍服，和所有的官兵穿的一樣。在他「以身作則」之下，十二戰區官兵的生活是一致的。一隊人馬排列在操塲上，你難以分別出誰是官長？誰是小兵？有一個笑話：一位來賓呌站在他旁邊的一個穿着肥大的黃軍服的人給他做幾件雜差，那個人認眞地做完了，事後，發現那人是一位團長。　　對於每個士兵，傅氏難有呌不出名字的。對於每個班長，則傅氏連他們的家庭狀况都十分淸楚。士兵可以隨時給他寫信，要求或控吿什麼，他每信必覆。官兵敬他，愛他而又畏他，因爲當他發現某人有犯罪行爲時，必嚴懲不貸。曾經有一位他很器重的營長，因販賣幾兩烟土，給他查出槍決了。（未完）星期倫壇禁止投機市場之建議  張白衣　　凡從事投機市塲之商人或業飯商人，在中國國民經濟組織中之地位，不僅爲如人體中之胃腸，且已如發炎之肓腸。普通醫學常識所知，凡人忠有盲腸炎，則必須割去，而毫無吝惜猶豫之餘地，倘不割去發炎之胃腸，則不僅爲人體一部份之疾患，且必招致生命之危險。故歐美國家，對於肓腸在孩提時即先行割去，以防肓腸炎之發生。　　中國投機市塲商人之思想與行動，在抗戰八年中已予我人以最深刻之印象，彼等實爲中華民族之敗類，其罪同於敵國之間諜或中國之漢奸，不僅爲搗亂中國國民經濟之竊賊，且爲危害中國國民經濟及國家財政之大盜。　　在抗戰前，投機市場已有存在，但因非抗戰時期，故從事投機之商人，其思想之發展尙不可測定，其行動之發展亦尙朱影響於經濟全體。及至抗戰勃發，證明彼等之思想，除圖謀財富之外，一無所有，彼等之行動，則可使中國經濟破產甚至國家危亡。我人在抗戰八年長期痛苦之痛苦中，對此已有深刻之認識，所惟在抗職結束後，國民政府尙未注意及此，更未能下最大決心加以取締及懲罰，甚使我人驚異。依據自戰爭結束一年有餘以來之專實所示，國民政府之經濟政策財政政策金融政策，對於投機市場，竟採長期姑息政策乃至長期追隨性之游擊　　爲證明中國投機市塲與投機商人之存在與活動；對中國抗戰經濟及建國經濟危害程度之可驚，特將中國投機市塲與投機商人在抗戰時期與復員時期之活動經過及其對巾華民國經濟與民族之影響略述如后：　　自抗戰勃發後，國民政府自南京遷往武漢遷往重慶，沿海被敵國海軍封鎖，工業地帶及產鹽主要區域均被敵軍先後侵佔，國民政府財政上主要三大源泉之關稅·鹽稅·及統稅收入均受嚴重打擊。同時因中國金融中心之上海陷於孤立，公債政策亦無充分發展之可能。此時國民政府主要之財源有二，一爲對外財源之借款·金銀·外匯（包括外國貨幣，外國有價證券，華僑匯款及華僑捐款獻金）二爲對內財源之國家信用（即法幣）。對外財源之借款，亦即國家之對外信用；此種財源，亦爲最主要者。（其後美國車火租借，亦可列爲國家之對外信用。）　　國民政府在抗戰期間由南京遷往重慶，凡爲巾華民國之國民，當可體認國家危急之程度。此時中華民國國民對於國家主要之前提與應有之態度，當爲對國民政府必獲勝利之信心，即不能勝利，亦必抱與政府共存共亡之信心，如此庶能從事長期抗戰。國民對國民政府應有之信心，某至低限度應爲擁護國民政府指定國家銀行所發行之中國法幣。倘我國人人擁護法幣，愛護法幣，將法幣所得之存餘，或法幣節約所來之數額，全部捐獻國民政府，或全部存儲於國民政府直接指導下之國家銀行，則中國國家對內財源當可由公債政策，溫和之通貨膨脹政策，及稅制之改革政策中籌措，物價之彼動當可减少，貨幣之價値當可穩定。但抗戰八年慘痛之經騐，我國戰時財政之財源，主要乃依賴於國家之對外信用，而國家之對內信用雖加利用，但因受投機市塲及投機商人之領導，竟使舉國人民對法幣時加奚落，直至今日，因錯誤之循環與通貨膨脹之循環，國民對法幣奚落允甚，以致法幣將陷於無法收拾之地步。換言之，外國友邦對中國之信用甚堅，而中國國民對太國政府通貨之信用反日漸降低，事之可悲，莫大於此！　　回憶當抗戰勢方軍心移至武澳時代，中國牧機市場與投機商人開始其叛國之行動。其主要活動區域，一爲特殊區之上海，二爲特殊區之香港。當時日本帝國主義之武力已控制中國沿海半國，除直接使用軍用手票，日太銀行中國版兌換券外，又利用傀儡政府發行其所謂華北聯合準備銀行兌換券及華與銀行券等偽幣，恃其武力，以其敵僞貨幣在淪陷區吸收我國大量法幣，復經上海及香港二大特別區域之中國投機市塲之謀介，以法幣掉換英美貨幣，藉以吸收中國法幣之外匯基金，轉而以此等中國法幣外匯基金更向英美等第三國家購買軍需物資，一方增加日本帝國主義侵略中國之戰鬥實力，他方則削减中國對外購買軍需物資之資金，亦即等於削减中國對日抗戰之戰鬥實力。此爲日太帝國主義之一石二鳥政策。吾人痛定思痛，當時設無中國投機市塲與投機商人之媒介，日本將無法利用敵偽貨幣妻換中國法幣外匯基金，故中國投機市堪與投機商人，其罪謂爲等於敵國之間諜，中國之漢奸，並不爲過分。國民如明瞭此種情形，亦當皆曰可殺矣。　　不僅此也，更値得吾人注意者，爲法幣因外匯　金之逐漸减少，而使法幣之對外價値（即對外匯率）亦逐漸低落。此爲使一般人民及一批流俗經濟學家懷疑國民政府實行通貨膨脹之開始。實際此時國民政府指定之國家銀行所發行之法幣，其數額並不過鉅，同時，因國民政府爲防止洩漏軍事秘密而不公布戰時財政收支數字，更使彼等懷疑國民政府有意施行通貨膨脹。因有此懷疑，見諸報端，聞諸街頭，一傳十，十傳百，人人對法幣信心乃開始動搖，資金開始外逃，投機市塲與投機商人更興風作浪，中國淪陷區之法幣，大量經投機市塲而變爲外國貨幣，或大量經由特殊區外國銀行而變爲外國銀行之外幣存款，一方由敵偽套購，一方由本身資金逃避，結果法幣外匪基金愈趨枯竭，於是法幣對外價值愈降。回憶筆者在香港時，法幣對港幣匯率，一九三七年九月爲一元法幣可換港幣九毫五仙，其後一路下降，由九毫五仙而八毫餘七奄餘六毫餘五毫餘四毫餘三毫餘二毫餘至一九四一年十一月則降爲一毫餘矣。　　法幣受敵僞貨幣之壓迫，復受國內國民之奚落，結果遂致法幣之價値降落，已如上述，在一般流俗經濟學家及無知國　之眼光視之，當然認爲政府實施通貨膨脹之結果。從而流俗之經濟學家誇張其理論之正確，甚至繼續口誅筆伐，以抨擊國民政府之財政貨幣政策，而一般無知國民則認爲以法幣爭廳外幣爭購金銀及爭購外幣有價證券或爭購外幣後存　於外商銀行或外國之銀行，如此可保其財產價値而引以自慰。彼等不知法幣在此階段，其信用與價値之本身根本未有不健全之事實，而實由於彼等對法幣之蹂躪與壓迫，致使物價　高，法幣價格低落也。換言之，法幣本無事，庸人自擾之，一般無知國民受俗流經濟學家及投機家之欺騙，而使法幣信用有人爲的降落，當然，陷害法幣之最大罪人當爲投機市塲與投機商人，再加流俗經濟學家理論之錯誤與夫一般愚夫愚婦之缺乏國家觀念民族觀念與社會觀念，遂使法幣信用日陷於危機。　　太平洋戰爭勃發後，敵國日本侵佔兩大特區之上海及香港後，該兩地之投機市塲及投機商人即消聲减跡。此何以故？蓋此時即使上海與香港兩地經營黑市外匯之投機市塲與投機商人繼續存在，縱令敵國仍利用敵偽貨幣經由投機市場套購中國法幣外匯資金，但因日本已與英美　國家直接交戰，故亦無法利用此等獲　到手之法幣外匯基金，而購置英美之武器與彈藥矣。由此觀點，中國投機市塲之在上海與香港，可稱爲日本帝國主義對華經濟作戰之御用工具，而一批大小投機商人，則可稱爲日本帝國主義對華經濟作戰之御用走狗。自太平洋戰爭後，投機市場對日本已無作用，同時亦宣言壽終正寢。故中國投機市塲里投機商人已完成日本侵華之經濟作戰之最後目的。由此可知投機市塲與投機商人，不僅爲中國經濟組織上之胃腸，且爲中國經濟組織上已發炎之胃腸。　　太平洋戰爭後上海香港之投機市塲雖告停止活動，但大後方各大都市突然發現新的投機市塲。此種投機市塲利用之方式雖非外匯，但事實上亦即傷害法幣之生命，此等投機市塲即爲囤，積物資以操縱物價上昇之投機市塲也。蓋太平洋戰爭勃發後，日本對中國經濟封鎖已完成其三重經濟封鎖之戰略，即海洋經濟封鎖，再加大陸經濟封鎖，以及空中經濟封鎖，三重經濟封鎖綫是也。經濟封鎖之後果，爲物資輸入數量之減少，投機奸商遂捨棄美鈔港幣或英鎊之投機活動，轉而作囤積物資之投機。投機商人旣利用其大量資金囤購市塲之物資，市塲乃因物資之突現减少而物價高他無已。此時流俗經濟學家又口誅筆伐，大肆攻擊國民政府之財政貨幣政策，抨擊國民政府實施通貨膨脹。一般愚夫愚婦更一唱百和，羣相爭購物資。市塲物資原可照常供應，但經投機好商及愚夫愚婦之有計劃的無計劃的大量蒐購，物價遂更爲上昇。此時一批流俗經濟學家以爲見解正確，認爲攻擊國民政府之通貨膨脹政策完全無誤。而一般愚夫愚婦更爭購不必要不急要之物資堆存於壁角，引爲得計，如此可以保持其財產價値。而彼等不知正墮於中國投機家之玩弄掌中。彼等不知法幣並未貶値，而彼等自己對法幣則正在施以壓力也。　　當此時也，日本帝國主義對中國經濟作戰之戰略亦隨太平洋戰爭環境之變動而變動，即放棄其以敵僞貨幣掉換法幣，再以法幣在中國投機市塲套購法幣外匯基金之政策，日本之新戰略爲利用武力禁止倫陷區流通法幣，以敵偽貨幣强迫人民繳出法幣，日本遂集中淪陷區大量法幣，利用大後方投機奸商之媒介，以法幣向大後方倒流，藉以在大後方吸收大量物資。日本此種政策，一方可使大後方法幣流通量增加，一方可使大後方物資减少。大後方通貨流通量與物資存在量，旣成反比例之現象，物價乃愈呈上昇，加之投機商之囤積與愚民之搶購，物價遂上昇無已。此可謂日本之一石二鳥經濟作戰之戰略，其作用與套購我法幣外唯基金相同，而投機奸商之有負於國，由此更可明白。　　大後方囤積物資之投機奸商與操縱物價之投機市場，係由於一般商業銀行錢莊與一部份政府貪汚官吏所構成，故其資金頗形濃厚，其囤積物資數量亦自然驚人。財政部自民國三十二年實行銀行營制，在各區設置銀行監理官及銀行鹽理員後，其主要任務即爲限制金融機構與投機奸商合作，囤積物資，而囤積物資之風始稍殺。　　此時大後方又出現經營黃金·美鈔·廬比之投機市場，此乃由於政府對囤積物資施行對策之後果。投機者無投機之對象，遂再度以外匯及黃金爲對象。自政府實施法幣折合黃金存款後至到期尙未還本付息時前，投機市塲之黃金投機活動極爲活躍。當時黃金官價爲每十兩値法幣二十萬元，但黃金現貨之投機市塲價格每十兩之最高價格曾達二百九十萬元，其相差之巨，實爲羅人。又對美官定匯率爲二十元法幣兌一美元，但黑市塲價格由七十元法幣逐漸增高至二千元法幣兌一美元，其距離之大，更爲駭人。　　在歐洲戰塲結束時，聯合國軍力漸偏重於遠東戰塲，一般國民對遠東戰塲呈現樂觀希望，爭購物資之風稍息，轉而爭購黃金，投機市塲及投機商人由此利用黃金大事作浪，使黃金黑市價格激增十餘倍。同時美軍來華漸衆，美鈔流入大後方亦日漸增大，此等美鈔雖非公開在市塲流通，但因有投機市塲之媒介，事實止美鈔之　人中國，等於中國之雙倍通貨膨服。蓋中國物實市塲，因大批美鈔購買力之伸入，物資當呈急亟之減少，物價自必突形上昇。當時因國際運輪之不便，美鈔流入中國早失購買海外物資之劃外支付之功效。因美鈔經投機市塲之媒介而伸入中國市塲吸收物資後，國民因見於物價之上昇，認爲政府通貨膨服政策愈來愈甚，於是對法幣之信用更淺，認爲法幣已無救藥，而將法幣立即換爲美鈔或黃金，如此，美鈔黑市價路愈高，而人民購買美鈔愈力。如以投機市塲之黑市匯率爲標準，同證法幣價値日趨低落，彼等不知法幣並未跌價，乃人民自以美鈔壓迫法幣跌價也。當時人民掌握美鈔，實際一無用處，蓋對美貿易旣不能通，亦不能以美鈔直接匯至外國，彼等掌握美鈔唯一之理由爲保持其財產與所得之原價値。換言之，彼等不信任中國之法幣，而信任美國之鈔票，彼等不知自身生在中國，住在中國，爲一中國之人民，不信任太國之法幣，而競購美國注入有限之美鈔，美鈔之價格當然增高。但彼等錯覺認爲美鈔信用確實比法幣信用爲堅，彼等不知美鈔黑市價格之高，乃由於彼等自己爭購美鈔而來也。其愚蠢固可謂已達極點，但彼等愚蠢之行動，實尼危害法幣之生命。但如無投機商人與投機市塲之存在，縱有大量美鈔流入中國，政府自可指定國家銀行，在一定之匯率下集巾交換。故我人不能責怪愚夫愚婦，我人祗有歸罪於投機市塲與投機份子。　　達東戰爭結束，人民對法幣之信用立即恢復，一般從事風積物資之投機奸商，首先以大量囤貨拋出市場，物價突然開始暴跌，正因物價暴跌，人民對法幣信用更堅，紛紛將不必要不急要之預購囤置之貨物出售，甚至將其舊貨設攤出售，以求法弊現金之獲得。在人人愛法幣現鈔時，黃金美鈔自然乏人顧問，結果黃金美鈔亦告暴落。此時大後方從事囤貨或購金之投機份子，因物價金價暴跌而自殺者，日有數起。最愚蠢之投機份子，因從事黃金投機而大富，自認爲最聰明，結果仍吞黃金而自殺。此爲投機份子應得之後果。　　隨戰爭結束而來者爲渝陷區之光復。大後方各大都市之投機市場與投機份子亦隨勝利而暫時停止活動。彼等深知上海將恢復中國金融中心之地位，遂轉至各收復區都市，尤其上海南京，與當地投機份子聯合，重作投機市塲之經營。在國民政府指定國家銀行決定兌換收復區僞幣時，投機份子立即以大後方法幣在上海等地大量搜購物資以囤積，在偽幣與法幣交換時之同時流通市塲時，收復區國民鑑於物價日高，逐紛將僞幣搶購物資，結果收復區物價日趨上昇。及至偽幣流通期截止及交換偽幣時限到達，一切物價均以法幣爲標準，人民遂認爲法幣繼續通貨膨脹，對法幣信用恢復戰時舊念，繼續加以奚落。凡得法幣，立即換以物資·美鈔·黃金。如此循環不息，物價及美鈔黃金價格日高一日，法幣之生命又吿動搖。　　國民政府之財政政策，自抗戰結束後，因承認收復區泛濫於市上之一切僞幣，結果增加中央銀行之發行負担甚大。倘當時立即禁止僞幣流通，而嚴格予以掉換法幣，則通貨膨脹之速度或較遲緩。但倘無投機市塲之從中興波作浪，物價上昇之速度亦可較緩。國民政府在收復區施行通貨膨脹政策，此時固無否認之必要，但倘無投機市塲之作祟與愚夫愚婦之愚蠢行爲，國民政府亦無施行通貨膨服政策之必要。　　自外匯市塲開放後，投機市場遂得意忘形，投機份子更放膽活動。此爲國民政府財政政策追隨投機市塲之開始。蓄國民政府自抗戰結束而後，其財政政策，一言以蔽之，不外與投機市塲之「鬥智政策」也！　　此時投機市塲之投機工具更多，除囤貨投機外匯投機及黃金投機外，更有證券投機。更可笑者，爲證券投機之公債投機，散播統一公債「孫幣」還本付息之謠傳，將其市塲價格提高至令人不信之程度。不問何種投機，其結果均爲傷書中華民國法幣之生命。是以筆者曾謂，投機市塲實爲葬送中國法幣之墳墓，而國民政府至今猶聽其存在，此爲筆者所百思不解者也。　　中國法幣被投機市塲長期壓迫，不論戰時戰後，使法幣之生命無法呼吸。時至今日，國人尙有何人，寗願以法幣所得之存餘，長期存入銀行作定期儲蓄與存款乎？　　筆者深信，國民政府爲革命之政府。正因爲革命之政府，其政策之實行必須具有革命性。國民政府爲維持革命之威信起見，務須繼續與一切腐化惡化勢力之集團鬥爭。換言之，在國民政府尙未完成孫中山先生之實業計劃以前，國民革命之使命猶未完成。是以現階段之財政政策，國民政府務須澈底更張，以革命性之手段爲之。　　欲維持國民政府之威信，必先維持國民政府之信用，欲維持國民政府之信用，必先搶救國家通貨之法幣。法幣爲中國國家之信用，人民愛護法幣即爲愛護國家。凡破壞中國法幣者，即爲國家之罪人，民族之叛徒。中國各大都市之投機市塲，實爲葬送中華民國法幣之墳墓；中國之投機商人，實爲中國經濟組織中之發炎盲腸。是以筆者認爲，欲營救中華民國法幣之生命，必先摧毀中國各大都市之一切投機市塲、蘭清一切投機商人。爲問中樞當局，有此眞切之認識與堅決之魄力吾耶？（卅五，十一，八。）</p>

<p>婦女與家庭　每星期二出版戀愛與真誠  若愚　　結婚是葬送戀愛的墳墓，誰在驚然間聽到了這一句話，一定要衆口齊聲地提出反對，但一徑詳細的分析，則配偶巾可適用此語的固不在少數。　　大凡一個人，不論男女老幼，一定有愛，才能感到人生的興趣。不過愛的種類不一，因此每一個人渴望的愛，也隨着年齡而變遷。例如在孩童時期，是需要父母的愛；）到成年時期，渴望異性的愛；及至老年時期，則期待子女的愛。如果每個人屆時不能得到應有的愛來享受，他對人生就感不到絲毫的樂趣了。　　現在世界的進化，日新月異，所以每個男女到了成年的時候，他們對於渴望異性的情愛，已經迫不及待，於是各地色情事件的產生也就與日俱增。尤其在這萬惡淵藪的都市，更特別的繁多。所以有很多的刊物，完全以色情新聞爲他們中心的資料。你想生長在這樣時代中的年靑男女，如何能够抑制得住色情的誘惑？甚至還有一部份，曾受敎育才識皆備的男女，竟也會誤解了愛的眞諦，鬧出許多被人輕視和攸關顏面的舉動，像這種自甘墮落抱憾畢生的行爲，完全是用愛的錯誤的結果。　　在這文明脫幅道德湮淪的現在，一部份年靑的男女，皆因爲受着不良風氣的燻陶，已經失去了純潔的天性，甚至以爲人生沒有欺騙的技倆，就不能適應現代的社會，所以他們對於戀愛，也就含着虛偽，在雙方熱戀的時期，互相不用眞誠坦白的態度，往往專以掩惡揚善藏短露長的技巧，來博取對方的歡心，全不計及將來的惡果。所以一等到結婚以後，彼此過去的虛偽完全大白，同時所有的劣點，亦皆盡行暴露，這樣他們的愛情，至少要打一個折扣，甚至造成更大的悲劇和不幸的局面。　　同時，在結合了以後，往往認爲旣然有了夫妻的名份，對於一切的一切，就可以處處隨便，不但修飾沒有像變愛時期的愛好，而且態度方面也就不似常初的謹愼，所以使得雙方的愛情更見退化，加　這樣日深月累的下去，而不加以補救，雙方的感情勢必由惡劣而轉趨破裂，卒至脫離關係了。　　最後筆者希望一般尙在熟戀而準備結合的男女，對於自己的缺點，須要從實的傾吐，同時結婚以後，仍須保特雙方戀愛時期一貫的態度，庶免結婚變成了戀愛的墳墓。美農業部展覽「能說話的雞」。  美國新聞處圖示這鷄的縱剖面。該鷄自己說出她需要什麽食糧，她如何生蛋等。餐時的愉悅  舒國慰譯　　賢明的太太們，這裏告訴你進餐時應該知道的常識，就是當你與你的丈夫孩子們一起進餐時，應該安靜愉悅，假使在進餐時，你們談不快意的事，（如訓斥孩子生氣等等）那未對你們消化委實有着很大的影響，眞的，現代的科學已給我們一個不容疑義的鐵證。　　依據實騐實得，當一隻活潑輕健安逸自在的貓用過　腴的餐物後，抓抓嘴巴面額揀一個牠所安靜的地方，伸着身子，展着四足，就呼呼地睡着了。這時若用透視鏡照察貓的內臟，可看見貓的消化作用進行得很順利，同時牠的神色非常恬適。驟然間留聲機的片子響出了狗的叫聲，睡着的貓，頓時聽起了，弓着背豎着毛，睜大眼睛，露出鈎爪，好像迎着未來的襲擎，這時，察着牠的胃腸，就遠非牠安靜的時光可比了；胃液充塞着牠的胃，蠕動成反向，食物像成了磚塊一樣，恬適安樂已消失而變爲緊張，單就這外部的反應，使牠的內部就起了急轉的變化，於是牠的消化是受到莫大的影響了。　　所以，無疑地在進膳時一定要融洽愉悅，否則，吃下去的食物，不僅沒有消化，反而在胃內作梗；就是說對身體不僅無益，反而有害。　　在有些家庭中，以爲在進餐時是一家聚集的唯一時刻，父母們以爲這時是對孩子說敎和規勸的唯一時機，殊不知這是錯誤的想頭。因爲當孩子進餐時，聽到父母們的訓斥，已無心於食物，忘記了食物的滋味，只在聆聽訓斥，甚至生着氣。假使在這時也用透視鏡來照孩子的胃腸，同樣地一如前面所說的驚起的貓一樣。所以許多人的胃病如胃酸過多症等等，就是由於用膳時不洽調之故。　　尤其是太太們，對於孩子似乎有更多的嘮叨，這實在影響孩子們的消化，爲害非淺。　　所以要極力避免，勿使不快的事情在進餐時　擾飯桌，况且憑那用膳時的一剎那，也解決不了什麼大事的。　　我相信在現在，還有不少的先生太太們在進餐時勞叨着，或對孩子們訓斥，或是談着不快意的事情，或是生氣着，這樣對於進餐的父母孩子，都是得不到良好順利的消化的。　　一個美滿的家庭，在進餐時，需要愉悅與恬靜；進餐時空氣融洽調和，歡悅安逸，這也就是一個美滿家庭的先決條件。孩子的玩具  墨萍　　從一歲到四五歲的小孩，他們大都是喜愛玩具的。並且往往喜歡把玩具塞人嘴裏，他們是不知道這件玩具是不淸潔的或有害的。於是做家長的就必須把他們的玩且加以考察，是否合於下列的幾個條件：　　第一，玩具上要沒有尖銳的稜角，因爲尖銳的角一不留意就要使孩子受傷的；　　第二，玩具上要沒有有害的顏色，那未即使小孩塞入嘴裏也不要緊；　　第三，玩具不可以太小，太小則容易誤呑入胃；　　第四，玩具須要堅牢而沒有落屑的，因爲恐怕破碎及落屑之片，使小孩嚥下面發生意外；　　第五，玩具須可以洗滌的，那麼可以常保淸潔。　　由此看來，則橡皮製的玩具最爲適宜，旣不易破碎，又可以淸洗，或有稜角也不至使小孩受傷。至於磁製，玻璃製的，則容易破碎，鐵製或銅製的雖然不易破碎，而易使小孩受傷。此外棉花製的，泥製的，其本身已不清潔，絕不可供小孩玩耍的。　　玩具能在無形中灌輸孩子的智識，陶養他的性情，所以敎育家每每利用小孩好奇心理，用各種玩具做他們敎育的工具，向兒童灌輸他的知識。如火車，汽車，飛機是怎樣的結構，怎樣的行駛，使他的小腦筋中，感受着印象，引起他的興趣，將來長犬便可加以發揚光大了。家事一得  茜譯　　檢拾碎玻璃碴時，要避免刺陂手指或脚底板，可將新鮮麵包一塊，，團成球形，像吸墨紙似的，把碎碴一一的黏起來。　　擦乾玻璃器皿時，應該用一條長的布或毛巾，把裏面和外面同時擦抹，使手指不要接觸到器皿上，這樣就可避免把指痕留在玻璃上了。　　漆的傢俱面上的水漬，用一塊法蘭絨，蘸了樟腦油或薄荷汕，先把斑點揩去，再塗上亞麻仁油或松節油就可以了。　　鑄鐵鍋子不用時，應該把鍋子上面塗上一層不含鹽類的油，再用紙包起來，放在乾燥的地方　　依照「烹調指南」一類的　籍烹調時，用一張透明的披璃紙，放在書頁上面，便不會把　弄　了。　　胡椒粉或者精　注入瓶中時，如果用信壳的一只角，剪去一小塊，就成爲一個很好的漏斗，使他們不致灑到外而來。爲什麽我的丈夫是好丈夫  泰譯　　六個美國妻子的自白　　（一）因爲他氣量大　　我的丈夫是個好丈夫，因爲他氣量大。他喜歡偵探小說，我愛俄國文學。他喜歡玩高爾夫，我愛看電影。他喜歡釣魚，我愛跳舞。我們倆共同的只有一點：就是我們互相愛戀。結婚九年他從來不强迫我看偵探小說或者玩高爾天。我怎樣支配家巾財政，他也從不過問，對於任何事情他都採取一種自由的態度。　　他把香烟灰隨處亂扔，沒有預先關照就把客人帶到家裏來，忘記掉我們的結婚紀念日，然而他的種種缺點，都被他的氣量宏大所掩蓋了。他是一個好丈夫，因爲他自由主義的精神使我的整個心靈歸屬於我自己，而不完全受他所支配。　　（二）他是個和平的丈夫　　我的丈夫是個好丈夫，因爲他不是一個喜歡吹毛求疵的人。結婚五年來，我記得我們從來沒有一次因爲批評小菜弄得不野而使一頓飯吃得不安樂，從來沒有因爲無謂的口角而使晚間不能安眠。我承認我的丈夫不是一個標準丈夫，然而誰希罕一個標準丈夫呢？我只感謝天主賜給我一個和平的丈夫。　　（三）丈夫沒有好奇心　　我們結婚將近四十年，我認爲我的丈夫是一個好丈夫；他最好的一點是對於我的行動絕對沒有過問的好奇心。他每個月給我一筆錢，然而從來不問我把錢怎樣使用，或者把錢儲蓄起來。我可以很晚回家，可以有些預想不到的訪客，我的丈夫從來不盤問我。這並不是因爲他對我的行動不感興趣，而是因爲他相信我自己能够管理自己的事，像他管理他自己的事一樣。對於我，他這一個俊點就是和平和快樂。　　（四）他不隨處放東西　　我覺得在我的丈夫許多優點中，不隨處亂放東西是他最大的優點。一個母親最討厭的事情，就是一方面敎孩子們把帽子掛在墻上，把鞋子放進抽屜，把衣服放進衣櫃，而一方面作爲孩子們模樣的丈夫和父親，却一點不負責任地把衣服鞋襪隨處亂拋。任何女人都會感到討厭的，如果她要一天到晚跟在丈夫的後面，替他收拾領帶，報紙，鞋，和襯衫。我從心底感謝我丈夫的母親，因爲她把她的兒子敎成了一個不隨處亂放東西的人。　　（五）因爲他善於贊美　　我的丈夫從來不忘記我不單是一個妻子，也是一洞女人。作爲女人，我是喜歡人家稱贊我的衣服漂亮，稱贊我打扮得引人歡喜，稱贊我做的薄餅最有味道的。這些甜蜜的言語使我覺得我的丈夫是個好丈夫。　　（六）因爲他有鎮靜工夫　　每當我急着趕趁火車，或者急着到什麼地方去的時候，我便佩服我丈夫的鎭靜工夫。他會看了着錶，對我說：「你以爲你趕得上兩點十五分一班的火車嗎？」我不慌不忙，說一定趕得上的。如果我丈夫大聲喝我，催促我，我着起急來，慌慌亂亂便趕不上火車了。　　我很感謝他的安靜的態度，每逢出外野餐，他總安靜地把必須帶的東西在最後一分鐘預備好，門窗等有損壞的時候，他總安靜負責修理，出外旅行的時候，他總把行李收拾好，把門鎖好。　　我想一個在要緊關頭能够鎭靜的丈夫是一個好丈夫。（譯自Getting　The　Most　Out　of　Life）</p>

<p>春秋國父的童年軼事  陸丹林　　國父的一生，致力革命四十多年，全是爲求中國的自由平等，爲求三民主義國家的建設完成；這種人格的崇高偉大和勇毅前進的精神，實在不必限於什麽紀念的日子，也該時時的追憶着，力行着。　　一個特異不凡的人物，在童年時期，也有他的異於凡庸之輩的軼事，國父童年軼事，現在趁着他的誕辰紀念，特來一談。　　國父的幼年，已有革命的思想，好似革命是與生俱來。他從來沒有自動去欺侮人家，但是，如果有人無理的侮辱他，他就馬上反抗，同時他有仗義與打打不的的氣。有一天，國父從書塾裏放學出來，順便到一個花園裏去散步，突然看到有幾十名淸兵，和衙役們，帶着武器，包圍園主的屋，把園主兄弟三人拖出，扣上脚鐐手銬，押解出去。其中的一個還遭了苦刑，其他的人却被監禁起來，家產也被査封。村人畏着暴吏，敢怒不敢言。國父却氣忿極了，鼓着勇氣，去問村長。村長發怒，拿刀威脅，禁止聲張。國父知道民權不振，汚吏橫行，反抗專制淫威，早已蘊蓄着在幼年時代。　　又有一次，村中有一家富商住宅，忽遭海盜洗刦，村人張皇失措的逃避，國父聞着，鎭靜　到　刦的人家去探視。那時恰値　匪搜索衣物的時候，他瞧着兇狠的盜匪面目，表示鄙屑的狀態。一方面暗駡地方官吏，不能夠保　公安，而地方又沒有組織起來自衛，致弄到盜匪橫行，如人無人之境。　　國父見着他的姊姊纏足的痛苦，他勸母親不要循俗着苦把姊吃。更是敵不過社會的陋習，家庭間一時不能改變，國父受了這個刺激，更決心努力發奮去改造社會。　　達成公是業農的，過的是簡單儉樸生活，國父晚間讀書，如果沒有月亮的話，才點燈讀書，有月亮就在月下讀了，但點燈只用一條燈車，不然，他的母親會責備他浪費的。他在這樣的環境下，很努力的誦讀溫習。他七歲入書塾讀書，塾師敎他「三字經」，雖然琅琅上口可誦，却不明書中意義，他問熟師，塾師也不能够說個明白，使一個幼年聰頴的學生得到領悟。　　他會問他的母親，靑天是怎樣的造成的？呌皇帝做萬歲，有什麽意義？人死了是怎麽樣？這些問題，都使他的媽媽不能够解答。後來他知道人死了，便完結了一切的事情，他便說，「我將來死了以後，不讓我的生命，就此了結」。果然，在五十多歲以後不出他的所說。　　數十年前，人們迷信偶像很深，翠亨鄉的北帝廟偶像的手，便給國父和陸皓東折毀了，這是激動鄕人們的憤怒的。然而國父知道那些木石無靈的偶像，絕不能够使人們蒙福消災，把他毁折，表示反抗迷信，使村人們知道泥塑木雕的人手所造之物，只是一個木偶而已，和人們的禍福，絕無關聯。　　國父幼年的軼事種種，無一不是表露他反抗強權，爭取人權，爭取自由，破除迷言，尋求眞理。「見微知著」，「即小可以見大」，而後來的四十年革命辛動，排滿倒　，　法戰亂，一切的事功，都　　在幼年時代，開始長成了。砂粒  蔣敦　　沉默吧！像一顆沉默的堅實的砂粒。　　一顆渺小的砂粒，沒有寳石的光彩，沒有黃金的珍貴，我們都似乎已經遺忘了它；但是，無數顆渺小的砂粒，却沉默的聚成了沙灘，形成了山崗，鋪成了我們的路……　　我們毫不在意的從它身上走過，它却親吻着我們赤熱的脚掌。有些用着緊强的步伐走路的人，砂粒會哎破他們的脚，留一點血跡，吿訴這是他們走過的路！　　砂粒吿訴我們；只有更頑强更堅實的生命，才能無處不有，才能永存！剩餘  岡悟　　吃剩有餘，棄之可惜。　　小四子吃大餅，芝蔴落在檯縫裏，拍的一記，掌心打痛沒關係，物資不曾糟蹋。　　本地人設宴，蹄膀，全鴨凍結未動，事後原封帶回，剩餘物資即使是鷄頭魚尾，西席先生和小孩子面上，還可派派竄頭。　　但是剩餘物資固多，剩餘薪水太少！　　却還有角落裏許多剩餘小民，有生以來，不會見過剩餘物資；二個月以後說來，用得着一句「有不得見者三十六年」。我們自己儘可再來利用剩餘精力作幾次剩餘內爭橫竪是一等强國，自有天公作美，「善後」救濟！　　公用事業諒必大有發展，「出無車」已經是剩餘的顧慮，剩餘的人力車，自然要歸於淘汰。剩餘的馬路讓吉普虎來馳騁，市民擠不上公用車輛，儘可利用剩餘的脚力來消磨剩餘的時間。　　舉奸當有限期，俾得保留許多剩餘的奸偽。泱泱大國，大可容納，萬一絕種，豈不可惜？爲人本偽，何必認眞？　　各國硏究原子，日本也要求保管，好罷！索性公開，放他幾彈，讓呻吟在疾苦中的剩餘人民，得個安全的「歸宿」！三兒  路陽　　—初戀的回憶　　三兒見我初中時一個女同學的乳名，不知怎樣大家曉得了。對於一個稍爲出色點的異性，男孩子們有時貪婪的像獵犬，有時在晚間自習完畢後的宿舍裏，年長的一些同學們，還說些令人難懂的褻謔的話。那時我年幼，就算個少年吧；但在不知不覺中，三兒已仿佛爬進我的生活中來了，甚至三兒已像是屬于我底什么，卻又說不明白是什么。　　第一次看見三兒，是在聚週會時的禮堂內。那時她坐在石側　後的一排，一個同宿舍的朋友指點給我；當我掉頭用眼光搜索她時，臉孔竟莫明其妙的紅燒起來；但我終於認淸她了，那烏黑的髮辮上　着的一對黃捐花，首先困惑了我。她底臉並不如想像中的白嫰，微微顯黑色；雙大眼睛迷朧着，像是雲務輕籠下的奇異的海；大半個身體躺倚在靠背上，胸部如波浪般的起伏，顯出頎長，弧形的美。我不禁低禱：蛇也似的輕盈的女郞啊！　　當天夜裏，我夢見那髪結變成一雙黃蝴蝶在眼前翩翩的飛。　　以後不久，她恰巧與我參加進同一個壁報團體；我底寫作能力與舉止風度，似乎漸漸吸引了她底注意。一個男孩子的長處，也一樣使女孩子們關懷吧？我想；同時加增了勇氣。　　我覺得我在愛她了雖然我不知什麼呌愛；只知道我底精神不能片刻離開她，如果我底生活中沒有她，那麼一切都變成無意義了；並且她只應該爲我所愛，她不能愛別人，別人更不能愛她。　　熱血燃燒在心底，每一次偶然的覿面，都令我心跳臉紅。我總該向她傾倒這無限情潮呀！談話嗎？不行。　　終於有這麼一天，我藉故誠她看一篇稿子，內中偸偸夾下一封長長的信。回來，便一頭倒在寢床上，不吃不喝，像染了瘧疾，一會兒興奮緊張，一會兒又自以爲『凉了』。　　第二天，當我掛着失眠後蒼白的臉色蹔進敎室時，奇怪的竟不見她的影子；定定神，我方發現貼在牆上的她的病假條子。　　三天，四天，我沒有收到半個字的答覆；我才眞正病了，不知所以的病；就是發高熱，滿口熱瘡，我被）送進了醫院。　　復活節的晨光，溫煦燦然地投射在病床的一角白衣天使們集體的大合唱由窗外傳來；明媚的媚的富有音樂性；的好日子啊！　　我底健康已逐漸復元了；絕望後的心情轉趨冷靜了。黃金般顏色的陽光沐照下，我欣然慵然地做着黃金般的夢。我憶起了故鄉，母親，和敵人殘酷的統治；我也憧憬到自己的前途，該是一幅壯麗偉大的塲面呀。　　『路陽！』我不信耳內會突然聽見如此淸脆微細的聲音；夢似的睜開眼，天！站在床頭的是一臉溫馨羞怯內疚的笑，掬着兩顆奇異發光的水晶寳石；是一雙翩翩輕翔着的黃蝴蝶；是……　　『啊，是妳？』我像從一個世界又掉進另一世界，不知覺的噙滿了兩泡淚水。　　當日下午我便出了院。　　此後在學校中，因爲環境的拘束，我們不能有暢快無忌的談話，僅在碰頭時相互射出含情關切的眼神，偶而傳遞幾封叙懷的信，但無論如何，我底心充實而洋溢着喜氣，脚下踢踏出靑春戀歌的節　。　　且別忘記：這是在戰時，又是淪陷區。就在這個暑期，我們的學校被敵人封閉了。　　多麽短促的一段乳色時光！　　分手前夜，我倫偸約她到禮堂內談話。她按時到了，但却帶了一位保鏢，也是班上的一位女同學。我頗感覺難爲情，話不知怎樣說才好；除了彼比交換一下前途的計劃外，竟沒有深人一句。惟一躍動在記憶中的，是她含羞的俯首，當我藉月色朝她側目凝視的俄頃。　　歸來我懊恨責備自己的不中用，但又不禁疑問：爲什麼女孩子在愛情上不願她的男友洩露秘密，而她們自己却往往布置智　團？　　深夜，我寫下五頁纏綿堅決的惜別函。　　再會伊人。當我僱人力車走出街口時，我發現她的那一雙星也似的閃耀着的眼睛，穿過黎明的薄霧，向我呼『再見』。從此，陪伴我的是貧窮，流亡，和不息的戰鬥，愛情將寫下不朽的史詩。從此，自由區與淪陷區間的鴻溝，隔絕了彼此的消息。　　勝利後不久，我寄給也一封織滿舊情的信。倏忽將近一年了，始終不見答覆。夏間偶遇由故鄉來的一位舊同學，恰巧就是頭一次指點我看認『三兒』的那一位，他說曾親耳聽三兒講，她對少年時的那些事已不感興趣了。　　一連好多天我思索着這件事，這不算戀愛，這算是少年時的一段喜劇；不！這算是童心未鑿的感情的汎濫。　　讓過去把舊夢埋葬吧，我當追求眼前的春光。熟年  蔡麟　　稻怕凜熟，今年秋天熟得很厲害，眼睜睜看着稻快乾死了，田坭亦龜裂啦，农夫日夜戽水，總算轉危爲安，今年倒有石二收成，米倒是熟年。　　棉花剛剛只有筷子般長的時候，老天不帮忙，刮大風，下大雨，把棉花浸死了，鄕下人哭哭啼啼，滿以爲今年的年難過了，想不到浸在水裏的棉花，迨大水退後，竟漸漸的死而復甦，而且是十足豐收，想不到棉花也是熟年。　　洋澄湖的大閘蟹，今年產量特別的多，那蟹籪上的無腸公子，多得比上海攔樓裏的臭虫還要閙忙，而且隻隻又大又肥，因此上海湖蟹湧到，頂大的一萬元可以買六隻，大閘蟹今年也是熟年。　　碰來碰去皆是愁眉苦臉的失業份子，也許失業朋友也是熟年。　　貪污案時有所聞，舞弊案更層見疊出，難道這算熟年馬？詩與現實  駱賓家　　詩人若每天能拉住現在，只把呈現於眼前的東西，時常以淸新的心境處理之，那麽無論何時何地，定能作還好。甚至很好的作品。即使偶爾失敗，也不會有什麽損失的。（引自「歌德對話錄」）苦力  羅幹年一寸山河一寸血　96  葉勁風　　「小姨，我數了數，朝北一溜下去，一共有二十九個這東西。」「這東西」當然指着砲位而說。　　「砲座何必要川煤塊來裝置呢？」我心下這般問着。我想鬼子的計劃，大概不外一搭兩就辦法；一面可以用煤塊掩藏砲位，一面也可把煤儘量儲集。也許僅僅浮面一層是煤，下面却是水泥建築的砲台和地下的砲彈庫呢！從這一點，也可見到日人的用心粗中有細，而細中却含着無限愚笨。然而在這窮鄕僻壞，早就弄下這種佈置，想想確實有些可怕。也可見到日人謀我的狼子野心，無所不用其極了。　　在煤堆頂上，倒又可以看見那架自動探照燈的光錢，在那裏劃着圖圈。只是角度不高，燈光不大，這裏一點也照不着。　　照我推算時間已極緊迫，也無功夫仔細研究這些砲位建築和佈置，便告訴虎弟，快快回到煤堆東邊，對付那些汽油。虎弟剛要動脚，我又抓住他，指了指儘西的區邊上，是怎樣形勢，是否看得出來。虎弟說他在煤堆頂上早就看過，像東邊一樣佈置，溪水的外邊，好像還有大路，不過這溪水同大路的中間，是些什麼地面，不大瞧得淸楚。　　要想大量燬去這些汽油，却也不是輕易工作。我心下擬就的辦法，預備先把這堆積如山的汽油底上一排汕桶，打開幾十桶，每桶祇需用什麽鐵器撬開一個小口，再把裝有唧洞的油池，儘量抽出油來酒遍這一塊十來丈方圖的地區，最好讓油往桶堆一方流去。這樣，只消一根火柴，這工區立即可以變成一片火海，那底層的一排汽油桶開口的地方，也立即可以着火。只要這些油桶着了火，火力之大，不愁不把所有油桶燒紅而至爆炸。　　我把這辦法，吿訴了虎弟，虎弟高興極了，然一面却直搔着頭皮，好像還有其他困難，我們沿着煤堆邊沿的地上，走着，預備從煤堆的南頭兜過去，順便還想看看那幾個高大的倉庫，是些什麽，究竟是不是倉庫。這也至多只需花費十分八分鐘的事，心下祇是希望還有意外的新發現。這一帶共是一色建築的（四座倉庫？）與東邊那四座四層樓建築遙遙相對，倒也整齊壯觀。　　到了那倉庫牆脚邊一看，北面一堵牆，迎窗孔都沒有一個，從東繞到南，以爲總有大門，誰知這兩堵高牆，從下到上只有三排圓形小窗，每排相隔八九尺模樣高下，面積很小，僅僅是一種氣窗裝置，這可以證實，這裏必是一種倉庫。一到西邊轉角，就在這角頭，備着一座大門一樣的裝置，上有一尺多見方大的兩個白字「出口。」我逼近一看，用手探了一探，知道是鋼鐵板製成的，却是整整一大片，並無拉手等類東西，並且全片都嵌在牆裏，一尺多深。我知這東西，必有電機管着；要開，必得發動電門，讓牠冉冉上升。從這一點，知道這倉庫，準是軍火庫無疑。　　我們忽忽沿牆跑到北頭，角上也有南頭一樣的門，有「人口」兩個大字。正要趕回汽油桶地區，動手工作時候，猛然　得，「篤篤」兩下，好像就在我們頭頂　着，這　聲響　像擴音機上發出。我同虎弟，一聽這種聲聲，嚇了一跳，這裏又

<p>自由談億國民大會堂  少夫　　今天，全國代表一千餘人將齊集在南京國府路上那座裔皇壯麗的國民大會堂中，進行國事的研議了，這座大建築遠抗戰前就完成，時間幾逾十年，才名符其實地達成其任務，可謂命途多舛了。　　我特別對這座建築物有感情，倒不是因爲九年前它落下之後舉行過一次「茶花女」的話劇演出，我在塲欣賞；而是去年九月初，勝利後初從重慶飛京，回到　隔八年的南京，第一個下榻處就是國民大會堂，雖然那時是相當殘破，近乎四壁蕭然，但在我們一行還都人心理上，敢說人人都對這建築感到十分親切。　　從南京的國民大會堂，會聯想到重慶復興關下的那座來，那座建築物落成之後，僅舉行過一次參政會，隨後便摧毀於敵機轟炸之下，在戰時的後方，物質條件那樣的困難，中央仍斥巨資建築那樣的一座大會堂，足見政府對於國大之決心。　　以四圍環境的氣象風光來說，重慶的那座大會堂遠比南京國府路上的佔優勢，可惜那塊基地如今已改建國民體淸塲了。周佛海殺無赦  洪果　　請政府必須維持原判　　周逆佛海之「謎」，終於在正義與國法前揭曉了！我們做人民的，希望國家一切都上軌道，聽到這一當局執法如山的消息，眞不禁拍案擁護。不料竟有漢字號的關係者，居然說：「我們想到周佛海在八年中名義上雖參加僞府，而實際上是對於人民有利益的；譬如發行僞鈔，這確可抵抗敵軍票，使失去了政府保障的人民，還可安居。周現已被依漢奸罪處罰，業已判決死刑，我們都感到判得太重」！　　周逆通敵作惡於前，而又獻功連絡我抗戰同志於後，一面靠中儲券發財，一面却又留一退步餘地。這種漢奸如果不死，我們以後如果有第二次抗日戰爭，請問誰再願意參加抗戰？我們覺得上述那種別具心腸的庇奸之論，値得注意；所以在周已於第一審被判死刑之後，我們仍要繼讀疾呼：請政府必須維持原判，一切可失，人心不可失！國人皆日周佛海可殺，殺無赦！求諸在我  吳君　　黃浦江上出現了六隻掛膏藥旗的日輪，鬧得滿天星斗，杯弓蛇影，大有談虎心驚之槪，其實，這又何必。問題很簡單，假使我們爭氣，我們就不用怕；假使我們不爭氣，豈但怕一輩子，而且隨時要受到人家欺侮，不僅僅一個區區三島的日本要看相我們。　　再反過來說，中美商的已經簽訂了，本身確是平等互惠，但是試問：他們有輪船過來，我們是否有輪船過去呢？他們有貨物源源不絕運過來，我們是否有貨物大批運過去呢？所以人家實際上是很佔便宜的。這原不能怪人家，誰敎我們不爭氣。　　因此，不間是敵是友，我們不爭氣，敵人固然要吞下我們，朋友雖不存心佔便宜，也佔了便宜去。讓這些膏藥輪去吧，別理它們，自己振作，才是正經！太不成話  桂德渠　　×式的皮大衣，×式的制服，皮鞋……；再配上××式的手槍；一位這樣裝束的×官，在明耀路燈光下的人行道上踱步，一面閒看着街沿的商號櫉窗。　　一位商人模樣的，挾一隻皮包，走過來一不留心，與×官撞了一下。　　商人看看，沒什麼，仍是向前走去；×官返過身來，追上去；　　「拍，拍！」左右　對方兩個嘴巴，「他媽的，你沒禮貌？」　　「你…打…」　　「他媽的，打你怎樣？你沒禮貌，×裏去！」說着又是兩記：「拍，拍。」　　商人連忙認錯·打躬·作揖·賠不是。　　結果大概仍是所謂「隊裏去」了。　　留下的一堆看閒的，有搖頭也有嘆氣。其中一個比較聰敏的說：　　「回家睡覺去啊！」　　於是聰敏的人們多各自回家「睡覺」去了，——太平，萬歲！徵婚  胡牧　　本來自己並不迷信，但無聊時偶過一測字者，伊日余今年有　信，余謀高典，歸而諸諸友人，因向某報登徵婚啓事一則日：「余不幸生於中國，更不幸長大於亂世，原來習政，現又從軍在精神萬般枯寂，窮愁潦倒之時，願徵一女友爲妻，應黴者應爲發國難財者之女，或大刮地皮而刦收者之令媛，不問伊學識如何，只視其金條若干，活動房子幾座？不問其品貌若何，只視伊並不斑麻　跛即可，應徵者請書自傳一則，照片二張，確在中央醫院檢查無不治之惡疾而附有證明者，投交本市××路××橋，×××號××先生代轉爲荷！」　　這廣吿曾在南京報紙刋出，但沒有人應徵。特將原文抄奉「自由談」，當作文章發表。讀者指敎！車廂失火  夏夜風　　據南京來人談，本月四日第五次由南京開出之特別快車，行至奔牛附近，三等車廂內忽吿不愼起火。當時秩序大亂，經半時許司車方聞聲煞車，然已有二人跳車殞命。　　據傳此次起火之原因，是由乘客吸烟不愼誤將烟蒂投入窗板內所致。　　中國人對於公共道德，一向是不甚注意的，尤其在公共塲所隨意吸烟，只顧一支在手悠然自得，那管別人被烘得頭痛眼花，甚至招致這次車廂失火的悲劇　　提到吸烟，就想到吸烟時的禮貌，在其他國度，在公共塲所吸烟，若遇有女性在座，先要徵得她們同意的，而很禮貌的問：「女士！你允許我吸一支烟嗎？」　　外國人是愛自由的，但他們又同時尊重別人的自由，在這一點上我們就値得學習，這是一種良好的禮貌，對於只愛自己自由，而不顧別人自由的我們「貴國」同胞，是値得參考的。　　在公共塲所（宴會除外）吸烟已是狠勉强的了，若在擁擠的火車上悠然自得的抽烟，豈不是太忽視了別人的自由了嗎？　　所以禁止在車廂內吸烟是需要的，並且應該嚴厲實行。　　火車失火，成了「火」車，在勝利後的京滬綫上，大概還是破天荒第一遭吧！經過這次的「敎訓」之後，路局也應該注意起來了，不要忽視吸烟的旅客，不要忽視可以燎原的烟頭，爲了整個旅客的安全！棉花與牲畜  胡言　　我國進口貨的第一位，據說是棉花，出口貨的第一位，據說是牲畜。　　我國向來號稱以農立國，棉花一項正是道地國產，但是棉花的進口，却佔了第一位！由此可見勝利雖已年餘，農村一直沒有復元，壯丁也一直沒有還耕，雖然地大物博，仍是一籌莫展。　　像棉花這種產物，只要有種仔，有土地，有人力，即使在機械甚爲缺乏的我國，也可以設法增產。在各省設立督導處，供給種仔，舉辦農貸，獎勵植棉，上下一心，只須一年，便可達到增產的目的，不從根本上着想，只知拚命輸入洋棉，豈不是滑稽？豈不是可怕？　　出口貨第一位的牲畜，究竟是些甚麼東西，實在使人煞費猜疑，是熊貓吧？大槪沒有這樣多，懸擬起來，大約總是些雞，鴨，猪玀之類，但是這些動物，我國向無大量出產，現在將這些牲畜，拚命出口，將來總要無以爲繼，而且一個國家，而乏得以牲畜爲主要出口品，也就滑稽得有些可怕了。　　以我國目前的經濟狀况而言，進口貨的第一位，應該是機器，一方面請聘外國工程師，訓練我國技工，拼命生產，才可以稍蘇民困。出口貨應該以礦砂絲，桐油，雞蛋；這些物品在國內的用處較少，應該官商合力，集體搜購，運銷外洋，才可爭取進出口物資的平衡。　　看看我們的進出口貨色，不免又發了上面這一段牢騷。牢騷，在目前，當然是値錢的！新聞人物老革命家覃振  鈍父　　最近乞休的副司法院長　　四十五年前，湖南省的常德中學中，舉行圖書館落成開幕典禮。當校長讀完了冠冕堂皇的訓詞，正將散會時，講台上突然踱上個土頭土腦的學生，對在座師生，鞠躬爲禮，便洋洋灑灑的來一下「演講」，大駡當時淸廷的腐敗，西太后的荒淫，同時則頌揚康梁，不遺餘力。這種「厥詞」——當時正是西太后埀廉聽政的時候。——應該是殺頭無疑，虧得那時常德知府朱叔彝先生（即朱經農氏之父），竭力維護，把他「開出學籍，驅逐出境」了事。這位被視爲「大逆不道」的學生，喏，正是現任司法院副院長覃振。　　覃氏被開除了學籍以後，便留學日本早稻田大學。日本當時受淸廷之請，頒布了「留學生規則」，取締留學生巾的革命份子，有湘籍留學生陳天華因此憤而蹈海。全體留學生都束裝返國。覃氏在湖南創辦西路公學，自任校長。正當這時淸廷厲行鎮壓革命下，我們的軍先生却又「不安份」起來，公然爲陳天華在嶽麓山營葬，淸吏大怒，明令逮捕。覃氏便又溜到了日本。隔了一年，自以爲沒有事了，又溜了回來，但是，這一次可糟糕，竟做了自投羅網的魚兒。　　這次覃氏的性命原是「休矣哉」了的，然而沒有死，原因是湖南省的學台對他倒有些「愛才」，靠了那學合的斡旋說項，覃氏只落了個「押解回籍，終身監禁。」　　溥儀登極，照例是大赦天下，我們的覃先生却在「十惡不赦」之列，沒有沾些兒「大淸恩典」。可是，曾幾何時，武昌槍響，全國響應，覃氏從監獄中出來了，從囚徒一變而爲臨時參議院的議員。　　十三年國民黨改組時，他任第一屆中央執行委員，二十一年被選爲立法院副院長，後調任司法院副院長迄今。　　覃氏字理鳴，湖南桃源人，他的爲人向來不拘小節，生活十足平民化。未任院長時，常與當舖結不解緣，現在雖居要職，境况仍不怎樣好。他不考究飲食，但極喜歡吃狗肉與烏龜肉。從前他是革命的急先鋒，現在早已「歛鋒藏芒」，沒有早年「劍拔弩張」的脾氣了，嘻嘻哈哈，不知老之將至。——且慢！前不多時候，報上不是說覃副院長以年邁乞休麼？這樣一位樂觀豁達的人，忽然會想起「老之已至」，實在令人不信。况且覃氏今年也才六十三歲，不能算是怎樣老，中央也已去函慰留了，但願覃氏放出早年氣概，再做二十年公僕！三毛  張樂平</p>

<p>國父誕辰紀念特刊　國父的憲政理想　　本報料室　　國父領導國民革命四十年，以憲政之實施爲其政治的最終目標。他探究各國憲政的利弊，認爲歐美等國的本權憲法，病在考試權附屬於行政權，彈劾權附屬於立法權，因此施行之時，難免發生種種流弊；中國古代實際本已有三權憲法的應用，但立法，司法，行政三權附屬於君權，而考試權與彈劾權名雖獨立，仍易爲君權所左右，國父體察中國政治的傳統和實際需要，首創五權憲法。他在「民權主義」旦　：「創立五權憲法，是補救從前的不完備。我們現在要集合中權，司法權，加入中國的考試權和監察權，連成一個很好的完　，造成一個五權分立的政府。像這樣的政府，才是世界上最完全最良善的政府。國家有了這樣良善的政府，才可以做到民有，民治，民享的國家。」這是國父五權憲法的理想　　從主義方面說，三民主義中的民權主義，正是五權憲法的發揮。而其完善的運用，則須靠權能劃分與均權制度。國父說：「請到國家的政治，根本要人民有權；至於管理政府的人，則要付之於管理政府的人，則要付之於有能的專門家。人民堂有選舉，罷免，創制，複決四種政權，政權是民權。政府權是立法，行政，考試，監察，司法五種治權。分工制衡，互助合作，然後政府可以做到萬能的地步。」　　實許憲政，將主權交還人民，這本是國父一貫的理想。在南　所訂的民國約法中，有「中華民國主　　於國民全體」一條，當初　是國父所提屆的。在「孫文學院說」第六章中，亦曾詳細說到國家如何進入憲政的過程：「革命進行之時期爲三：第一，軍，憲政時期。第一爲破壞時期。第二爲過渡時期：以一縣爲自治單位……以三年爲限……俟全國平定之後六年，各縣之達完全自治者，皆得選舉代表一人，組織國民大會，以制定五權憲法……憲法制定，總統　員先出後，革命政府當歸政於民選　之總統，而訓政時期於此告終。第三爲建設完成時期，擬在此時期始，施行憲政。……人民對於本縣這政治，當有選舉之權，創制之權，複決之權，罷免之權。而對於一國政治，除選　舉權之外，其餘之同等權，則付託於國民大會之代表以行之。」　　可見五權憲法的重心是在全民政治，而全民政實現，又以完成分縣自治爲　石。這一個意義，在民權主義裏表現得極爲鮮明，國父說：「若無分分縣自治，則人民無所憑藉，的謂全民政治又無由實現。無全民政治，則雖有五權分立，國民大會，亦未有主權在民之實也。」　　國父在晚年手訂建國大綱，其第一條即規定「國民政府本革命之三民主義五權憲法以建設中華民國。」我們國所要建立的旣是三民主義的共和國，而五權憲法又是實現三民主義的　一方法，所以由國　憲政運動，應以三民主義的建國運動爲骨幹，而以五權憲法的理想爲依歸。這是國父對於憲政的理想，也就是中國憲政運動應循的歷史途徑。國父最後的遺容　本報資料室藏國父軼事　　本報資料室　　國父家世，自十二世祖連昌公至國父爲十一世，連昌公以前，因輾轉遷徒，中山縣故里所藏族譜中未有記載。中山大學史學教授羅香林研究姓氏源流，爲國內權威，經多年研究搜集，張望於廣東東江發現國父上世族譜，自國父始祖至十二世祖連昌公，世數名諱與行實，皆甚明確，足以證明國父上世各代西寗都，元明之際，復遷廣東，滿清入關，甞與同邑鐘姓在抵禦清兵，敗後，族人散居各鄉。至康熙時，以墾殖遷香山湧口間，數世後遷翠亭村。羅氏發現此珍貴族譜後，復參考羣　，互相疏證，已撰成國父家世源流考專書部世。　　（一）　　國父年十八，入香港皇仁醫院　業，受犀利於美國綱紀慎教會，名籍下註「孫日新，香山翠亭鄉」，蓋取大學苟日新，日日新，又日新之義。國父師區鳳墀先生爲之改號逸仙，旋用逸仙之名投入廣州博濟醫院附設醫學校，其後畢業香港雅麗醫校，開業澳門廣州，即皆以此名行。　　（二）　　國父少寓檀香山時，一日往訪教會司鐸杜南山君，見其架上有一醫科書籍，問何以需此，杜答謂范文正公有云，不爲良相，當爲良醫，竊取此意耳。國父領之。異日再見杜君日，君爲我舉范氏之言，竊以爲未當，吾國人讀書，非從政，即從政，亦未必秉國鈞，倘殫心力以求作想，於事必無成，我意一方致力政治以救國，一方致力醫術以活人，縣其等　以求之，庶有穫也。此語爲杜司針鐸在南洋對鄧慕　所述者，國父救國學醫並行之志，當已肇於此時矣。　　（三）　　國父於博濟醫學校求學一年，即轉入香港雅麗醫學校。該校爲香港律師何啓所創辦，以紀念其英籍亡飲水思雅麗者。國父於校中求學五年，用菌之勤，記憶之強，專研之精，爲其他一切同學所不及，各科考試，無不滿分，至畢業時，惟一科爲九十餘分。校中教員及試官乃會議，羣以如此成績，爲歷來所罕有，惟一科略缺數分，未免美中不足，決議加給若干分，乃以第一名全部滿分之榮譽畢業。其畢業諱經校長教員十三八試官八人並牧師書記官等簽字，由香港總督羅便臣爵士授予。國父醫照爲一八九二年七月廿三日所發。　　（四）國父旣卒業，即在澳門二地行醫。光緒十九年正月廣州中西日報即載有國父返廣州時之行醫廣告，云：　　「敬啓者，本局敦請大醫生孫逸仙，來省濟世，舊歲底因事返澳度年，今已由澳返省，謹擇月之初十開辦，所有贈醫出轎規矩，一律如前，每日十點鐘至十二點鐘在局贈診，不受分文，以惠貧乏，求醫者須在十點鐘以前，來局掛號。午後出外診症，西門收　金一元，城內南關西門河南等處，轎金加倍，謝步隨意致送，凡延診者，預早到局掛號。先生素以濟人利物爲心，若有意外與夫難產服毒等症，服明危急，無論貧富，俱可立時邀到，設法施救，辛母觀望，以免貽誤！此佈。洗　東西藥局謹啓。」　　　　國父醫術精良，而待人接物，尤復慈祥和藹，當時廣州官紳民衆，無不知有孫醫生者。所得診金及藥費，多用以交結志士，聯絡會黨，準備革命。東西醫局司理爲博濟學校時同學慶文卿，亦革命志士。　　（五）　　民國紀元前一年，國父居美國舊金山，向海外華僑一板築三層西人小旅客，起居出入至爲簡單，房間內除必需牀桌外，堆積中西羣藉，鑑史地圖尤多。旅居主人以爲住　者係一中國老留學生，不知即爲領導中國革命之大政治家也。國父甞週遊各國，考察其政府制度與組織，日常除演講，開會，籌餉外，從不涉足酒樓戲院，惟不斷閱讀於政治，外交，法律，軍事等書籍，而於礦，農業，畜牧，工程等項，亦多注意，其好學不倦之精神，爲常人所不能及。　　（六）　　上海雖僻處東南海隅，但素爲全國之神經中樞，國民黨領導國民革命，屢曾以上海爲發號施令之所，全國各地，亦恒以淞滬之馬　是瞻。如辛亥革命前後黨人之秘密機關部爲白爾部路漁陽里三號；民國成立，淞滬光復前生，革命之總樞紐爲薩坡塞路五十八號陳英士烈士公館；而北伐前夕策劃進行之總部，則爲環龍路四十四號之中央黨部華中辦事處。至於國父在滬之寓邸莫利哀路十號，尤爲人所熟知。　　莫利哀路爲霞飛路西段一冷僻支路，自東祖西，不過半里，團父寓所在該路東端，上有藍瓷白字門牌。民十三年國父來滬，即曾於此處招待記者，痛斥北方軍閥之禍國。該宅爲兩樓兩底，陳設簡單而潔淨，國父寓滬時日不多，平時係由一老僕名老李者收拾看管。樓下計應接室與藏書室各半。樓上東間臥室，西間書　，外間欄一角爲小會各室，耐同志秘密集義之所。與洗用具，則置於後埭亭子間。寓所陳設不知，尙不如一中等公寓，其生前自率　約如此。國大會代表招待所　本報駐京記者攝國大招待所　首次巡禮　設備完密·服務週到　配合各代表日常需要　　本報特約記者　丁匡華寄自南京　　國民大會代表陸續來京後，街頭景色倍覺熱烈，民主空氣，充沛全市。記者曾至中政校國大第一招待所作首次巡禮，招待所設備，係以配合代表日常之需要，門首有郵政儲金匯兌，社會服務，中國文化服務社在此并畫報代辦部，陳設書籍以關於國民大會及完草問題爲多，供代表隨時研究參考。招待所內可容四百人，代表宿舍甚恩同再造雅潔，棉被床東均係新置，代表旅次疲勞，今獲圓滿招待，深感舒適，所有僕歐，亦活潑。報到代表，可領公費卅萬元，證章一枚，一月餐券一本，理髮券一本，沐浴券一本。證章係鋼盾之多角梅花形，中　「國民大會」紅字，光輝奪目，類似勳章。招待所內，設有國大準備會議室，幹事會辦公室，招待處各組長聯合辦公室，使大會代表獲得密切聯絡。紀念國父期望國大  方治　　在民族革命的聖戰，已獲得最後勝利，建國工作正積極展開的今天，我們又面臨這偉大的節日——兩國革命導師三民主義的創造者　國父孫中山先生誕辰，同是又是　國父組黨革命，畢生奮鬥，而臨終尙　　告誡，遺囑於「最短期間促其實現」的國民大會開幕的一天，使我們更覺得意義的深刻，我們今天已達成此一歷史任務和時代使命，中華民國從今天起已走上了歷史的新頁。　　國父誕生於一八六六年，自幼即以解放中華民族爲職志，數十年如一日，無間寒署，不畏艱辛，奔走革命，雖歷十次之失敗而不挫其志，而革命的目的，則在求三民主義之實現，建立民治民有民享的國家，使中華民放獲得自由平等，進世界於大同，雖　國父不幸早逝，未能目見其手創之中華民國的復興，和世界侵略者的潰滅，與被侵略者的得救，俱　國父的誕生就是中華民國的誕生，　國父組黨的開始，就是中國新生命的開始。　　自從民國紀元前十八年，　國父創立興中會展開中國國民革命以來，國父領導於前，主席繼承於後，到今天是五十二年了，在此五十二年中，雖然本黨在組織方面，由興中會而中國同盟會，而國民黨，而中華革命黨，以至於現在的中國國民黨，經過了六次的變遷，但主義與革命的精神，則始終一貫，始終爲達到民族自由，民權平等，民生幸福而努力。　　回溯五十年來的奮鬥經過，賴本黨諸先烈的犧牲奮鬥，與夫全國志士仁人的見義勇爲，不屈不撓，前仆後繼，卒能推翻了數千年來，根深蒂固的專制政體，完成北伐，統一中國，以及抗禦外侮，廢除百年桎梏的不平等條約，使中華民族能由垂亡而漸趨復興，中國國勢能由黝暗而漸趨光明，在這一過程中，真不知拋了多少頭顱，洒了多少熱血，如「三二九」廣州之役，武昌之役，討袁之役，謹法之役以迄於北伐抗戰，真是轟轟烈烈，空前絕後，而這種犧牲奮鬥，成仁取義的革命精神，尤足以驚天地而泣鬼神。　　本黨五十年來革命遭遇，雖然不同，但革命的精神和職志則已臺上述一貫在在求實現三民主義建立民治民有有享，實行憲法，還政於民，本黨五十年來，始終爲達成此一目的努力，今天國民大會，終於在這歷史世人—國父孫中山先生的誕辰揭幕了，我們歷盡了艱難困苦，終於達成了此一目的，我們民主政治，已由願望地爲事實，而本黨政於民的職志，也由呼喊而見諸行動了！　　這是歷史的新頁，我們國家從此已走進一個新的階段，而我全國同你敢，從此以後，將享受着憲政所給予的自由幸福和保障，我們而臨着這偉大歷史任務展開的今天，我們應該怎樣地民奮和祝頌，我們應該怎樣地感謝　　國父，以及諸先烈的革命奮鬥，和當今　主席的英明領導，但是也更該警惕着今天是我們國家劃時代的一天，今天以後我們國家的盛衰與廢，將由上的一天，今天以後我們國家的盛衰興廢，將由此而決定其命運，我們應該大家推誠心，佈公道，一本　國父的「天下爲公」的精神，來奠定國家百年大計，我們尤希望各黨各派人士，能各本其謀國素志，捐棄我見大家精誠團結爲國爲民，要努力並爲富強康爾民主自由之國家，打下基礎，　　主席在本月八日昭示我們「此數週內實爲關係國家盛衰之重要關鍵，吾人如能竭盡努力，則不以樹立強盛繁榮，民主的中國基礎，吾人必須克服任何偏見，猜疑，仇恨之情緒，以貢獻於全民利益，而今日全國人民最迫切之需要，實爲和平與安定，余深望本黨同志，各黨派人十，社會賢達，政府同人，全體宮兵以及各有關方面人士，務必精誠團結，通力全合作，以和平之方式，達成「政治民主化」，「軍隊國家化」之目的訓示而一致努力，使大會得順利進行而　滿完成。　　今天是偉大的革命導師——國父孫中山先生的誕辰·又是担負歷史任務底國民大會的開幕，有　國父然後有中華民國，那未今天應該是中華民國的誕辰，更是中華民國新生命的開始。國父誕辰話翠亨　　本報資料室　　往地圖上翻到廣東省的一頁，在粵江口西岸，你會很快地找出中山縣來。中山縣西北，有一個小圓圈註「慛亭」兩字——，這便中華民國偉大的國父孫中山先生的故鄉！　　清末被稱爲「四大寇」的　國父和尤少　，楊鶴齡，陳少白四人中，國父和楊鶴齡兩人的故鄉都是廣東中山縣翠亭村，這風景幽美的小村子，秀氣獨鐘，在中華民國開國歷史上，寫下了光榮燦爛的一頁。　　讓我們先來介紹一下以前稱做香山縣，而現在稱爲中山縣的大略輪廓吧。　　香山人中一百數十萬，是廣東富饒的一縣，稻榖一年二熟，有些地方竟達三熟。因爲沿淥的緣故，主要的出產是　鮮，　尤其有名。境內多山，樹木蒼胡，頗有熱帶風光，假如你有機會到一次中山縣，景物的幽美和鄉民的富裕而敦　，會使你　嘆不置。中山縣的歸國華僑相當多，多數年青時在美國，掙得一筆錢圖老家來成室造屋。縣郊村鎮中洋房幢幢，便是他們的成績。　　國民政府爲了紀念國父，除了香山縣改名中山縣外，歷任縣長都經當局慎重選派聲聲望素著的大員擔任，凡　築　港垖規劃市區，莫不全力以赴。像從前唐紹儀氏就曾任過中山縣長。所以中山縣的縣政，也是成績優異素著的。　　從中山縣到翠亭村，若是坐汽車去只有一小時的行程。國父的故居就在村中壽屏街一號，那是一座灰暗的　矮洋房，前面圍着矮牆，門上刻着黨國旗。大門內有一個小天井，天井左路右兩旁有着十個水泥做的小花　，靠右連還有一樣國父手植的酸子樹。正屋一共三開間，屋後還有一個小小的園子。——就是這麼一座平凡儉樸的屋子，曾在這亭誕生了一位世界上空前的偉大人物，改變了五千年老大中國的歷史。　　翠亭村中，值得介紹的還有一座紀念中學，它在村中是建築得最漂亮的一座房屋，白牆碧瓦，全部是宮殿式，氣象，四幢課堂的題名是「壽屏堂」（紀念國父之兄壽屏公）「鶴　堂」（紀念四大寇之一的楊鶴齡）「皓東堂」（哲生堂。另有一幢極大的禮堂。門外有一促廣大的停車塲，牌坊式的大門上，有孫科所題目「私立總理故鄉紀念中學」十一個大字。這所學校，是在民國二十一年十一月與築的，大禮堂則在二十四年添築。　　紀念中學後面的山上，有着國父的父親道川公的墳山。那地名呌做「泥頭尖」，林大蔥鬱，氣勢宏偉。　　離國父故居一二百步，還有先烈陸皓東的故居，是很寬敞的中式平房。陸烈士的墳墓和楊鶴齡氏的墳墓·也在翠亭村山上。　　翠亭村的居民永遠把　國父掛在口頭，愛向每一位遊客娓娓地談些國父家庭瑣事和當地風士掌故。他們驕傲着他們的村子裏出了這麼一位了不起的人物。翠亭村的居民永遠忘記不了　國父，全中國的人民也同樣忘記不了　國父。</p>

<p>國民大會與制憲　揭開民主憲政序幕　跨上更高新階梯　　本報資料室特稿　　國民大會，經過了多少年的籌備和多少次的波折，決於十五日在首都正式揭幕了。　　召開國民大會制定憲法，原是　國父的遣都，也是中國國民黨還政於民的一貫的理想。　國父把韓國的工作分做三個階級：軍政，訓政，憲政。在軍政時期，推翻專職，掃滌軍閥；在訓政時期，屬精圖洽，訓練人民行使民棟；到憲政時期，即召開國大，制定憲法，結束黨治，還政於民。可知國民大會乃是從訓政時期到憲政時期的最重要的關鍵，也是國民革命最終極的目標。　　歷史的追溯　　民國二十一年十二月，國民黨第四屆中央執行委員會第三次全體大會中通過了「集中男力挽救危亡案」，決定「擬召開國民大會，制定憲法」，並決議　成立法院根據　國父遣教，於最短期內起草憲法草案，以備國民研討。根據之個決議，立法院於次年一月成立了一個憲法起草委員會，由立法委員吳經熊張知本等四十餘人組織之，以院長孫科爲主任委員，並聘請了許多知名的專家學者爲顧問，開始進行憲草的擬訂工作。憲法是立國的最高凖繩，也是傅之萬世而不易的法典，其起草工作，自應特別審慎周密。所以第一步，憲法起草委員會決定了一些起草的程序與原則。關於原則的決定，共有十七項，但後琰擬訂憲　法時，有幾項也曾略有更改，例如領土一項，起先原則上是決定採用概括式的，但後來制憲時却改用了列舉式。又如原則中本規定總統不得連任，但「五五憲草」中却規定總統連選得連任一次。　　這個憲法的擬訂是一件十分繁重艱困的工作。因爲五權分立的政治理想乃是　國父採技歐西各國三權分立制的菁華，矯正其缺陷，更參照中國數千年來立國的精神和當前的實際需要而創立的，歷史上可以說是從無前例可循。因此，憲法起草時所發後的各種問題，也引起了會內外專家學者的劇烈爭辯。例如，關於均權主義，有人主張地方事權應採用概括式。另一部份的則主張喘事權應採列舉式，地方事權則採概括式。關於總統的連任問題，有人認爲原則規定不得連任一次或二次。又如關於副總統，有人主張取消，也有人主張保留。而爭辯最烈者，則是關於憲法的編製問題。一部分負責起草的委員主張按照三民主義的章次分篇，臺以民族之地位，等爲民族篇，人民權利，政府組織等爲民權篇，國民經濟，教育等爲民生篇；也有一部分人竭力反對，認爲這樣的分法未免太機械化。　　二十二年二月九日，憲法草委員會開第一次會議，以後共開了十二次會議，決定了起草的進行程序，起草原則，和編制方式。同年六月，起劃委員會副委員長吳經熊以個人名義發表了他的「中華民國憲法草案初稿試擬稿」，（一般簡稱爲「吳稿」）以供國人批評討論。「吳稿」全文分總則，民族，民權，民生及憲法保障等五篇，共二百十四條。「吳稿」發表以後，各方熱烈參加研討，國內憲法專家亦多紛紛爲文評論，起草委員會並亦指定了委員七人爲主稿委員，就試擬稿加予審查修正。後來，因爲感覺根據一種試擬稿討論，難免有疏漏之處，所以又加上了張知本的草案試擬稿（一般簡稱爲「張稿」）一併作爲討論的參考。如此，又艱過了好幾有的商計，主稿委員會乃根據這些試擬稿加以修正而訂定「憲法草案初稿」。這個初稿共分十章，凡一百六十六條，於二十三年三月正式公布，再供各方討論。這就是所謂第一草案。　　這第一次草案，經多數專家詳加研討，提出修正建議以後，二十三年十二月，國民黨四屆五中全會開會時，提出審議意見　，並交立法院再行修正。立法院修正後，於廿四年二月再度公佈，這就是所謂第二次草案。　　二十四年十一月，國民黨四屆六中全會對第二次草案復加研究審義烏，並決將其將付第五次全國代表大會依較長時間的精密討論。十一月十二日，五全大會開會，除由憲草審議會提出了審議意見二十三點外，並決議定二十五年五月五日正式公佈憲法草案。二十五年五月一日，立法院第四屆十九次院會上將草案三讀修正通過這就是所謂第三次草案。　　五月五日，國民政府就把這個草案正式公佈，定名「中華民國憲法草案」，因爲它是五月五日公布的，所以一般都簡稱之爲「五五憲章」。　　「五五憲草」計分總編，人民之權利義務，國民大會，中央政府，地方制度，國民經濟，教育，及憲法施行與修正等八章，凡一百四十六條。這是國內憲法專家學者集三年餘心直所得來的結晶，也是此次國民大會　所要討論的憲法的藍本。　　我們讀了這一段經過，當可明白五五憲草　生之不易，這正是代表着國家對於這件事情的審慎和重視。當時公布的五五憲草中，原規定「第一屆國民大會之職權，由制定憲法之國民大會行使之」這意思就是說，第一次召集的國民大會其任務是制憲而更兼行憲的。但事實上，制憲的國民大會，在組織與代表的產生上，與以後行憲的國民大會都頗不相同，因此，二十六年四月中常會開會時又重行予以修正，規定第一次國民大會的職權只在「制定憲法並決定憲法施行日期」。所以，這次召開的國民大會，其任務只在制憲而並不行憲，憲法一制定，它的任務就告終了。至於憲法的行使，則要歸之於以後依照憲法所產生出來的國大。因此，就性質上說，這次召開的國民大會其實並不是相當於歐美各國的議會（Parliament）或者國會（Congress），而只是一國革命或軍事甫定以後所成立的臨時的「制憲會議」（Constituent　Assembly），這一點是許多人所未曾弄清楚的。　　代表的選舉　　除了五五憲草以外，立法院還擬訂了兩種有關的附　法　公布；一是「國民大會代表選舉法」，凡八章六十條；後者自然更加重要。國六代表選舉的種類，係分三種，一是區域選舉，二是職業選舉，三是特種選舉。區域選舉即是以各省上市爲單位的選舉，其代表名額的分配，係以人　的多　爲比例，此項人口的統計，則係根據內政部二十四年底所編造的各省市報至內政部的統計表加以計算。各省代表以九名爲最低額，四十四名爲最高額，各市二名爲最低額，八名爲最高額，如此，可使各省市的代表名額不致相差得過遠，而人口稀少的省市也能得有機會發抒意見，不致全爲人口衆多的省市代表所操縱。至於各省選舉區選舉區域表爲依據，由各區推出代表，然後逐級選出。　　至於職業選舉，係就各省市職業團體的人數作適當名額之分配，其根據，主要的爲當時內政實業教育等部所供給的職業團體統計資料。至於自由職業團體，則全國　分區域，凖用　於職業團體的　　規定，而由自由職業　　選舉　　督主　辦理。此外第三種爲特種選舉，其下更分作四類，一是　、　、　、　四省的選舉，因爲那時東北四省仍在淪陷中，區域選舉辦　自然無法　用，所以不得不用特種選舉；二是蒙古西藏兩地方的選舉，因爲　藏地區廣大，交通不便，所以也　使用一般的區域選舉方法；三是在外僑民的選舉，專設有華僑代表選舉總監督；　是軍隊選舉，　專設有軍隊選舉總監　辦理之。　　以　國大代表計區域選舉代表六百六十五名，職業選舉代表三百八十名，特種選舉代表一百五十五名，總共國大代表爲一千二百名。　　憲草和選舉法規都公布以後，各地即積極進行大選。國大代表選舉總事務所成立了，各省市的分所以及各職業團體選舉的總監督亦都先後委定。原先的計劃是在二十五年十月十日左右選舉竣事，十一月十二日召開國民大會，但由於全國幅　的遼闊，人數的衆多，更加交通的不便，到期時各省市的代表尙未能完成選出，於是由國府明令延期一年，至二十六年十一月十二日舉行。　　（下文接第十一版）國民大會組織法　及代表選舉法的演變  陳玉祥　　　兩個基本法律的第一次修改　　國民大會組織及國民大會代表選舉法是國民大會的兩個基本法律，這兩個法律已經兩次修正，現在我們要把它的本來內容和它修正的經過－它的演變·作一分析；但其中的情節，相當複雜，故希望讀者對於本文的敘述，不要斷章取義，必須一氣閱讀。再則，本人所述的國民大會之組織法及代表選舉法係制憲的國大之組織法及代表選舉法，而非依據憲法產生的行憲的國大之組織法及代表選舉法，關於這點，文中難屢有說明，但在開始敘述本問題的演變之前，有特別提出請讀者認識此一前提的必要。　　上面兩個法律，原始的條文，係立法院於民國二十五年四月三十日及五月一日，二日光後通過，由國民政府於五月十四日公佈；我們知道，五憲莫國民大會章均明定第一次的國民大會即行使憲法所賦予之職權，即無所謂制憲的國大與行憲的國大之分。旣然如此，國民大會組織法之所謂國民大會應即是五五憲草中之國民大會，但關於國民大會的組成，兩者（國民大會兩個基本法律與五五憲草的國民大會章）的規定竟大不相同。（詳後論）。國民大會原定二十五年十一月十二日召開的，五月十四日公佈的國民大會代表選舉法，於七月一日施行自是而後，政府積極辦理國民大會的選舉，期國民大會代表均能於開會前選出，但當時情形，有若干省市或因中央政府權力未能完全行使，或因對外關係，其選舉延未辦理，欲於十一月十二日召開國大，事實上頗有困難，中央有鑒於此，是年十月十五日的國民黨中央執行委員會特議決國民大會展期召集，二十六年二月二十日國民黨五届三中全會除明定二十六年一月十二日召集國民大會外，並有督促主管機關繼續辦理選舉及授權中央常務委員會修改國民大會組織法及代表選舉法的決定。中央常務委員會根據這個決議，於同年四月二一日對國民大會組織法及代表選舉法通過了重大的修正意見交立法院修正，復由國民政府公佈。　　上節說到，國民大會的兩個基本法律與五五憲劃的國民大會章有其矛盾之處，所以這次的修正實是必要的。照五五憲草國民大會章關於國民大會代表人數的規定：「國民大會以左列國民代表組織之，一，每縣市及其同等區域各選出代表一人，但其人口逾三十萬者，每增加五十萬人增選代表一人，縣市同等區域，以法律定之。蒙古西藏選出代表，其名額以法律定之。僑居國外之國民選出代表，其名額以法律定之」面原始的國民大會代表選舉法規定「國民大會代表之總額爲一千二百名，依左列款分配之：（一）依區域選舉方法選出者六六五名，（二）依職業選舉出者三八〇名，（三）依特種選舉方法選出者一五五名」。原始的國民大會組織法規定：「中國國民黨中央執行委員，中央監察委員爲國民大會當然代表。」兩法旣與憲草不符，而原始的國大組織法開宗　　第一條即明定如此選舉出來的國民大會行使憲法所賦予的職權，五五憲劃第一四六條亦有同樣之規定，兩者所定之組織有異，而任務相同，這如何說得通呢？雖然憲法是草案，但兩者都由立法院在差不多相同的時間公佈，（一日五月五日，一是五月十四日。）當時旣無意將制憲的國大與行憲的國大分開，則何以國民大會代表選舉法所規定的代表名額會與憲草所定的不同？如果說國民大會代表選舉法所規定的是過渡辦法，那末，旣然又明定，「行使憲法所賦予之職權，」是不是要實話憲政後再等六年——國民大會的代表照五五憲草所規定的任期爲六年——然後才能選舉憲法所規定的國民大會呢？也不知感覺到第一次的國民大會不宜於行使憲法所賦予之職權呢？還是發再也在差不多時間所公佈的法規和憲法草案抵觸！於是二十六年四月二十二日國民黨的中常會對於兩者的條文遂有修改之舉。　　這次的修改，首先是把國民大會組織法的第一條：「國民大會制定憲法並行使憲法所賦予之職權」改爲「國民大會制定憲法並決定憲並決定憲法施行日期。」這樣一來，在理論上便說得通了：修改後的國民大會組織法及國民大會代表選舉法，是專門制憲的，憲草所定國民大會的各種職權，制憲的國民大會是無權行使的，而國民大會制定憲法決定憲法施行日期以後，始依憲法選舉國民大會代表行使憲法所賦予的職權。到於這制憲的國民大會將怎樣制定憲法，甚至將這憲草中的國民大會章大加修改的。國民大會組織法第十一條「國民大會會期定爲十日至二十日，必要時得延長之。」此時中央常會將其刪改爲「國民大會於會期完畢，任務終了。「同時，五五憲草第一百四十六條「第一届國民大會之　權由制定憲法之國民大會行使之　的條文也被中常會所刪除了，因爲只有這樣，才能合於邏輯。　　此外，原始的國民大會組織法第三條規定：中國國民黨中央執行委員，中央監察委員爲國民大會當然代表，第四條規定中國國民黨候補執行委員，候補監察委員，國民政府主席，國民政府委員，國民政府各院部會之長官，及國民大會主席團特許之人員均得列席國民大會；修改後的國大組織法將三，四兩條併爲第三條：「中國國民黨中央執行委員，監察委員，及候補執行委員，監察委員爲國民大會當然代表，國民政府委員及國民政府各院部會長官得列席　民大會」。這樣，修改的國大組織法之當然代表的範圍已比原始的組織法所規定者是擴大這是原始的組織法所沒有的。　　代表選舉方法的分析　　至於除當然代表及指定代表之外的各種候選人的來歷，照原始的國民大會代表選舉法所規定的辦法，　區域選舉，由各選舉區推選出十倍於各該區應出國民大會代表名額之候選人，就呂由國民政府指定三倍於各該區應出國大代表名額之候選人，再由各選舉區選民就此候選人中國定一人。　職業選舉，由各省市職業團體推選出三倍於各該團體　出國大代表名額之後選人，就　由國民政府指定二倍於各該團體應出國大代表名額之候選人再由各該團體有選舉機之會員，就此假造人中選舉一人。自由職業團體國大代表之推選指定及代表之選舉，凖用關於職業團體之規定。在特種選舉，遼·吉·黑·熱國大代表的假造人，由國民政府指定三倍於各該省應出代表的名額，再由各該省有選舉權者照第六條約規定辦理，但選舉人　有選舉總事務所發給的選舉證，蒙藏的選舉一部份係依照各省選舉所規定的辦法，（如哲里木盟等），在外僑民的選舉，其後選人的推選及指定，此照關於職業選舉的規定，（推選候選人的團體，由僑務委員會定之），代表的選舉，照區域選舉的規定。軍隊的選舉，由陸海空軍軍隊及軍事教育機關推定，並由政府指定九千名爲候選人，候選人的資格除如區域選舉者外，並須曾在國民革命軍服務五年以上著有勳績或曾在軍事教育機關畢業學行俱優者。這是原始的國大代表選舉法所規定關於代表選舉方法的大概。　　照修改後的國大代表選舉法，除特種選舉外，（（一）遼吉黑熱四省這選舉，（二）蒙藏之選舉，（三）在外僑民之選舉，（四）軍隊之選舉）所有第六條以下由國民政府指定候選人的規定，一律取消，選舉亦仍分爲區域，職業，及特種三大類；在區域選舉，由各選舉區推選出十倍於應出國大代表名額的候選人，即六六五〇名，選舉人即就此六六五〇人中選出國大代表六六五五名，（不必再由國民政府在六六五〇人指中定十分之三）。其配額如下：　　江蘇四四名　浙江三三名　安徽三五名　江西二八名　　湖北四〇五　湖南四三名　四川四四史　西康九名　　山東四四名　河北四三名　山西二二名　河南四四名　　陜西二〇名　甘肅一四名　青海九名　福建二二名　　廣東四四名　廣西二一名　雲南二二名　貴州一六名　　察哈爾一〇名　綏遠一〇名　寗夏九名　新疆一二名　　青島二名　西京二名　　候選人的推出，係由各選舉區各縣市之鄉長，鎮長，坊長或其相當人員參加推選，各選舉人沒有推選之權，各選舉區的候選人須年滿二十五歲，選舉當時爲該選舉區內的人民，但其公民的宣誓不以在該選舉區內舉行者爲限。　　在職業選舉，由各省市職業團體推選出三倍於各該團體應出國大代表名額的候選人，即一一四〇名，選舉人就此一一四〇名中選出國大代表三八〇名，其名額的分　爲：農工商團體三二二名，由各省市的農工商會分別依其　出代表名　選出。自由職業團體五八名，內律師一〇名，會計師五名，　藥師八名，新聞記者一一名，工程師六名，教育團體一八名。　　職業團體參加國民大會代表的選舉，必須該團體在國民大會代表　　法公　前依法成立者爲限。因此·南京市，西京市至候選人的推定，係由各省市職業團體各該團體的執行機關職員推選；候選人的資格，除須年滿二十五歲及有選舉人的資格外·並須從事各該職業滿三年以上，（不論是一次的或斷續的）但須被選舉時爲各該團體的會員。職業團體的組織如有數級·候選人的推選，由各該職業團體中最下級團體之權　職員爲之，國民大會代表的選舉，由各該職業團體中最下級團體的會員爲之。　　至於特種選舉，其配額有如下列：　　遼吉黑熱選舉四五名，內：遼一四名，吉一三名，黑九名熱九名。　　蒙藏選舉四〇名，內：蒙古二四名，西藏一六名。　　在外僑民選舉四〇名，分二十四區辦理，內檀香山，秘魯，墨西可，印度，歐洲，朝向，大溪地，智利，古巴，中美，日本，澳洲，冰洲，香港，澳門，台灣各一名，加拿大，菲烈賓，緬甸，各二名，美國，安南種三名，荷蘭，馬來，暹羅各四名。　　軍隊選舉三〇名。　　特種選舉的選舉方法已見上文，這裏須加一筆說明的，便是特種選舉，情形特殊，或有無法舉行選舉的情事發生，則可略去推選－指定－選舉等手續，而逕由國民政府指定代表參加國民大會。　　國大代表的選舉，旣有區域，職業，特種的區別，所以在選舉法中又規每一選舉入不能有兩個以上的選舉權，於區域選舉及職業選舉均有選舉權者應參加職業選舉，於特種選舉及職業選舉均有選舉權者，應參加特種選舉，於職業選舉有兩個以上選舉權者，任其擇定爲一個團體的選舉人。　　舊代表的資格問題　　以上國民大會組織法及國民大會代表選舉法的條改情形及其選舉方法的分析。國民大會，二十六年因戰事爆發而未克召開，惟對戰爭，歷時旣久，政府旣以抗戰建國兼行並進爲號召，國民參政會中的各黨派亦不斷有從速實現憲政的要求，此項要求，至民國二十八年九日國民參政會第一届第四次大會時，益爲有力。自這時起，有一個問題，漸爲人們所注意，便是戰前所選出的國民大會代表及國民大會當然代表的資格問題。誠然，當時國民大會已選　出的代表大都是民國二十五年摶產生的，由於國民大會召開日期的一再展延，這是距離選　出的時期已經有很多年，國民大會代表的任期照憲草夫定亦不過六年，則這些資格當至民國三十一年以後是否繼續有效，自然頗爲各方所爭議。但筆者始終認爲制憲的國民大會旣並非依憲法選舉組成的國民大會，則應繼續有效，以使其制定憲法，完成其制憲的任務。民國三十三，四年間，頗有人以爲國家在戰後復興工作多端，若制定憲法後再選舉國民大會，不免增加民間紛擾，爲省去許多並不必要且可避免的麻煩，及從速走上民主的大道，以免空費時日，延遲擱置，增加周折，有損國本起見，主張恢復國民大會組織法原來的規定。大公報等常有這種主張，三十四年五月五日召開的國民黨六全代會亦有這樣的提案。這裏，有兩個問題，便不能自圓某說：　　第一，制憲的而又行使憲法所賦予職權的國民大會的組成不是憲草所規定的國民大會了。國民大會組織法及代表選舉法是否即可作爲憲草第三十五條所定「國民大會之組織，國民代表之選舉罷免，及國民大會行使職權之程序以法律定之」的所謂另定的法律呢？這另灶　的法律爲什麼在代表當選等等方面與憲法抵觸呢？即使就以這制憲的國民大會來行使憲法所賦予之國憶大會的職權，那末依憲法產生的國民大會代表是否要等到憲法實行之後的六年才能產生明？　　第二，國民大會應否有當然代表也是問題，國民大會組織洗列有當然代表一項，五五憲草則無此規定。所以筆者是始終以爲從理論上講，此制憲的國大是不能行憲的。前面已經相當詳盡地說明制憲的國大行使憲法所賦予之職權在理論上爲不可通，所以二十六年四月才把國民大會組織法，代表選舉法及五五憲草的條文加以修改，如果要恢復二十六年四月以前的規定，豈非又置於無法解釋的境地。一般人不求甚解制憲的國大與行憲的國大之分別，前提旣然未曾認識，錯誤的見解自然難免了。　　但話說回來，國民大會旣然有權制定憲法，當然也可以有權規定自己是否就可以執行第一届國民大會之職權，這在憲草上雖未明白規定，然而却不能解釋爲國民大會就沒有這種權力。國民大會在開會時間是至高無上的，它要怎樣規定都可以，對於憲法旣都有權制定，行使職權問題，自然也有權來規定它。（下文接第十六版）</p>

<p>國民大會與制憲　　本報資料室　　民二十六年七月間，各省市的複選正加緊進行，預計一二個月內即可全部竣事，準備召開大會，正在此時，七七事變發生，全面的長期抗戰開始，政府傾其全力，抵禦強寇，而當選的各方代表，亦皆大多數分在前方後方擔任與抗戰直接有關的工作，無法能抽身出席從容討諭的會議。因此之故，國民政府又不得不於廿六年十月四日下令，國民大會延期舉行。憲政的實施，於是又因日寇的侵略而突遭頓挫。　　建國的基礎　　國民大會的召開雖然是延期了，但政府對於國大的準備，即使是在艱苦抗戰的八年間，亦未嘗一日稍懈。各省市的代表有因抗戰發生而未及選齊的，亦仍積極繼續選舉，江蘇，浙江，安徽，江西，湖北，湖南，四川，西康，山西，河南，陝西，甘肅，寗夏，靑海，福建，廣東，廣西，雲南，貴州，綏遠，新疆等省及南京，上海，靑島，西京等市代表都先後選出，各省職業代表的選舉亦皆絡續辦竣。同時，政府雖不願急求迫功，在抗戰期中召開一個草草登場的國民大會，但爲了集思廣益，使全國的人才都能竭其心力，謀取抗戰的勝利和建國的成功，所以在二十七年便成立了一個具有國大精神的國民參政會，各省市許多民選的國大代表都被羅致，共謀國是。到三十二年秋天，國內外的形勢，都對我抗戰有利，勝利業已在望，政府愈感覺戰後的國家建設應在勝利前就打好基礎，所以那年九月間國民黨五屆十一中全會開會時，對於憲政的實施問題，會作極詳盡的討論，並通過了一個關於實施總報告的決議案如下：　　「本屆全會開幕之時，總裁訓示諒諄以「促進憲政實旅」勗勉同志，本會議於聆取實施憲政工作進程之總報告以後，深覺關於實施憲政之工作，雖在日寇侵略國難嚴重之際，仍能繼承總理遺志，發揚數十年來本黨爲憲政犧牲奮鬥之一貫精神，客服困難，努力邁進。今抗戰勝利在望，憲政基礎已立，全國上下自應集中力量，爭取勝利，鞏固統一，本抗戰建國之精神，恪遵總理手訂建國大綱之規定，從速召開國民大會，頒佈全國共信共守之大法，以完成建國之大業。」　　在這個決議案中，並宣布了政府定戰爭結束後一年內召集國民大會，制定憲法，並由國民大會決定施行日期。　　十一中全會以後，國民參政會在重慶開會，爲了加緊憲政的籌備，會中曾通過決議，向國防最高委員會建議設立「憲政實施協進會」。國防最高委員會接受了這個建議，「憲政實施協進會」在三十二年十一月十二日正式成立了。三十三年元旦，憲政實施磯協進會發動「全國人民研討憲草運動」，這個運動引起了廣大熱烈的反應，許多憲草的問題，如國都，人民之權利義務，國民大會的組織與職權，以及中央與地方的分權問題等等，都曾引起各方面熱烈的討論，得到了許多寶貴的收穫。　　憲政的籌備已經漸臻，成熟階段了，三十四年五月，日寇在各戰場節節敗退，政府鑒於勝利已在眼前，故決定不待抗戰勝利，即提早結束訓政，還政於民，實施民主憲政的政治。所以，國民黨六全大會在重慶開會時即通過泱議：「國民大會之召集日期，定於本年十一月十二日。」各方亦皆加緊準備。　　是年八月，日本宣台無條件投降，全國忙於受降及復員的工作，其時原定的國民大會召開日期已近，但國內的政治糾紛，卻亦日趨尖說，政府爲了謀取勝利後的安定統一，不惜委曲求全，召集各黨派及社會賢達代表舉行政治協商會議，商討國家由戰時到平時，由抗戰到建國的方案。政治協商會議，於三十五年一月十日在重慶開幕，其所討論的範圍，雖亦包括停止軍事衝突，改組國民政府等等問題，但其中最重要，最困難，爭執最烈，解決最遲者，也仍然是憲草問題和國民大會問題。政協自一月十日開冪，至三十一日下午閉幕，其最棘手的國民大會新增代表名額的分配問題，是遲至那天上午的分組會議才取得協議的。　　政治協商會議閉幕以後，二月一日發表了「政治協商會議議決案」，其中四五兩項即係有關憲法草案及國民大會者。關於憲草，政協通過了一個「憲草修改原則」，這個條改原則，正如蔣主席在政協閉幕式中所指出的，在法理上對將來的國民大會韭無任何約束的能力，而只是在提供國民大會「採納」，但政協中各黨派間曾有一種諒解，即大家將努力使這些修改原則能在將來召開的國民大會中通過。所以，這些修正原則雖無法理上的地位，但亦自有其事實上的重量。修改原則計分十二項，但後來的政協綜合小組和憲草審議協商小組聯席會議中，曾對這些修正原則又提出三點修改。這兩項文件集關重要，讀者可以作比較性的研究和參考。　　關於國民大會、政協決議案中通過了下列八點。　　（一）國三十五年五月五日召開國民大會。　　（二）第一屆國民大會之職權爲制定憲法。　　（三）憲法之通過，須經出席代表四分之三之同意爲之。　　（四）依選舉法規定之區域及職業代表一千二百名照舊。　　（五）台灣東北等新增各該區域及其職業代表共一百五十名。　　（六）增加黨派及社會賢達代表七百名。其分配另定之。　　（七）總計國民大會之代表爲二千零五十名。　　（八）依據憲決規定之行憲機關，於憲法頒佈六個月內，依憲法之規定，選舉召集之。　　這第六點新增代表七百名的分配問題，議決案中寫着的是「另定之」。上文設過，這個問題在會中爭執最烈，解決也最遲，但決議案中雖未錄入，會中各方都已有商定。即新增的代表七百名中，計國民黨佔二百三十名，共產黨二百名，民主同盟一百名，靑年黨一百名，社會賢達七十名．並由國民黨與共產黨商定，各讓出十名與民主同盟。所以結果，就是國民黨二百二十名，共產黨一百九十名，民主同盟一百二十名，靑年黨一百名，計會賢達七十名。這是各方的默契，而爲議案中所未錄的。　　大會的任務　　三十五年五月五日召開國民大會，原是政治協商會議所通過，爲各黨各派所一致同意。但至召開期近，中國共產黨及民主同盟方面都俱諉藉一些別的理由，而拒不提出代表名單，以致若干國大代表雖已到京等待開會，而仍只好廢然而返。政府爲了要貫澈實施民主憲政的初衷，不忍見十餘年來準備憲政的努力功虧一簣，所以不惜再度宣布國大延期至十一月十二日舉行。　　現在，中國歷史上第一次的國民大會，已定期在首都南京開幕。．這次國民大會的任務，我們在第一節中曾約略提及，就是在制定憲法並決定憲法施行之日期，而並不包括行憲。這一點似需要略加說明，使我們能對這次國民大會的目標與任務，有真切的了解。我們知道，憲法是一個國家立國根本的大法，由一個特設的機關，以超然的立場來詳細研討訂定，更可以顯示出憲法的重要與尊嚴。在歐美各國，其制憲的手續亦都經過這一個階段的。例如美國獨立以後，一七八七年即曾由各州選派代表舉行憲法會議於賓夕法尼亞洲之費城，會議歷四月之久，憲法草案才告完成，並交付各州所組織的臨時國民會議通過。至一七九〇年，十三州先後批准，乃成爲今日北美合眾國之憲法。又如法國革命後的第一次共和憲法，也是由一個特設的制憲機關所制定，而再付公民表決的。再者，依照國民大會組織法，國民大會是一個制憲的機關，可見是先憲法而存在的，然而行使憲法的國民大會，卻必須依憲法的規定而組織，可見這兩者完全是兩回事，不應該相混的。如果不依照憲法而成立的國民大會可以行使憲法所規定的國民大會的職權，這在法理上是講不通的，所以，制憲的機關和行憲的機關必須要分開。復次，憲法草案係由立法院擬定，政府公佈，人民如果有什麼意見，都可充分發表，提出修正。而人民意見的傳達，在討論中自然必須經由人民所選出的國大代表。國民大會開會的期限只有二十天，如果除了制憲以外，還要顯到行憲上的種種問題，事實上亦未必可能。最後，建國大綱第二十三條敘述國家由訓政進入憲政的過程時，也曾規定「全國有過半數省分達至憲政開始之期，即全省之地方自治完成之期，則開國民大會，制定憲法而頒佈之。」可見國民大會乃是在憲法以前所存在的機構，其任務在制憲而不在行憲，乃是國父的遺教。所以，這次的國民大會，在實質上應該稱之爲「制憲會議」或者「憲法會議」。真正的國民大會是須至憲法正式通過後，根據憲法第三章來組織的。因此，在這次的大會中，憲法第三章關放「國民大會」的條文恐怕也仍將成爲熱烈爭辯的中心。　　這二十天的會期中將產生出一部中華民國立國的最高法典，將揭開國民革命最終目標的民主憲政的序冪，將引導中國跨上一級新的歷史的階梯。今日，全中國四萬萬五千萬人民的眼睛都會望着南京，望着這二千多位代表。國民大會負着如此神聖重大的任務，讓我們在此先預祝它完滿的成功。新聞記者空軍少尉　包圍朱經農追隨王曉籟　國大代表報到鏡頭　　朱經農氏爲了報到，特地抽空趕到南京來。剛到報到處，就被一群新聞記者圍着，大談其商務印書館的經營。他辦理手續時，笑容可掬，抽籤的座次是五二五號，運說：「還好，還好，不算遠。」　　已報到的代表中，立法委員最多。顯然的，這些立法專家們必定會在此次大會裏大顯一下身手。　　王曉籟氏抽到的號數是一四七八，身邊有位穿軍服佩空軍少尉的青年軍官，爲他在樓上辦理手續領過食宿費後，漫步走出門外，王氏與之對談，聲音細小，態度慈靄親切，有人說道位也許是他的少爺。（本報特約記者丁匡華）國民大會組織法及代表選舉法的演變  陳玉祥　　（上文接第十四版）　　至於人們爲什麼反對舊代表有效呢？其理由可以民主同盟在民國三十四年三月十日所發表的關於國民大會的五項主張爲代表，茲摘述其要點如下：　　一，在最近八九年間，中國經過一度歷史上空前未有的對外戰爭，世界朮經過一度空前未有的大戰，其所影響於人民心理及其政治意識，實至爲深遠；以八九年前所選出的代表，欲以之反映經過八九年鉅大變化的民意，爲事實上所不可能。況且國民政府所公佈的憲法草案，明明規定國民代表的任期爲六年，誠以經過六年的時間，人民的意向不能不有極大的變化，其代表應予改選，是事理的當然。假完二十四五年所選出的代表仍屬有效，則已超過憲法所規定的任期，以有權制頒憲法的第一次國大代表，如首開此違反憲政精神的惡例，其所予國民不良的印象爲何如？此其一。　　二，根據國民大會代表選舉法的規定，二十歲的國民有選舉權，二十五歲的國民有被選舉權，經過此八九年的時間，則凡在戰前已屆十一二歲的國民，在今日已獲得其法定的選舉權，凡在戰前已屆十五六歲的國民，在今日已獲得其法定的被選舉權，合計兩者的人數，其總數當不少於三千萬。且這些少壯分子，實際即對抗戰貢獻最多的分子，爲國家建立足主憲政之基而召集的第一次國民大會，竟剝奪這些人的選舉權及被選舉權，在事理及情理上均不可通，此其二。　　三，經過八年抗戰，各區域的情勢已較戰前大有出入，如不顧各該區域人民的情感，仍以戰前所產生的代表作成全國人民必須遵守的種種決定，萬一大會開會時，各該區城的人民起而嘖有煩言，謂此類舊代表已不足以代表各該區域新近的民意，則已出席大會而與各該區域有法定關係的各代表，豈不將陷於啼笑皆非？其所及於國家的不良影響，又寗可數計，此其三。　　四，當民國二十四·五年舉行選舉之際，固猶是黨權極盛之時，當時各黨派很少有參與選舉的機會，即平日在社會上推負時望的各界人士，也絕少有被選爲國大代表的可能，甚至即在國民黨黨內的若干賢達，對於當時選舉的情況，亦認爲不滿的。今時移世易，世界民主高潮，既挾其排山倒海之力以俱至，而全國必須團結以共度難關，又爲時代的迫切要求，如置上舉事實於不願，仍舉八九年前所產生的舊代表，以之應付當前千難萬難的新局面，所謂民主團結是徒託空言，此其四。　　五，國民大會開會之日，應即爲國民黨黨權暫告結束之時，但尋繹國民大會組織法第三條，國民黨中央的執監委員及候補執監委員爲國民大會的當然代表。依據上舉事實，九年前所辨的選舉，原屬國民黨一黨所主持，今更益以此數百名的當然代表，則在將來大會內所表現的一黨空氣，寗不稍嫌濃厚？萬一國民不諒，以此而疑及「還政於民」不過僅有其名，而「黨權合法化乃爲國民黨所要求的實際」，則國民黨黨內賢達何以自解，此其五。民主同盟宣言的主張，實際就是共產黨的論調，至於這些主張，是否有其理由，我們這裏不費筆墨一一剖析，讀者只要一讀本文的前後就有數目了。不過這些見解的傳播。阻礙國民大會的召開，則爲不可否認的事實。三十四年八月，對日戰爭勝利結束，國民大會行將召開而共產黨企圖造成內亂，因又國共談判的公開舉行，同年十月十日，國共發表會談紀要，聲明國民大會代表應否重選，國民大會組織法及代表選舉法應否修改，提由政治協商會議決定，政治協商會議於三十五年一月十日開幕於重慶，國民大會一案即爲該會議中最飛唇舌的一個問題。　　政協會議中的各種意見　　政治協商會議於一月十七日開第七次大會時，國民大會問題被列入該日的議程，並於十八日繼續討論。在政治協商會議中，各方面對於國民大會代表資格問題的意見，可以分作（一）舊代表有效說，（二）舊代表無效說及（三）調節案三方面來講：　　第一，國民黨是主張舊代表應繼續有效的。在十七日的大會中，張厲生首先說明國民黨代表團所提出關於國民大會的意見，共計四點：（一）民國三十五年五月五日召開國民大會；（二）第一屆國民大會之職權爲制走憲法；（三）第一屆國民大會代表除已選出者外，其餘名額，可使之合理增加；（四）第二屆國民大會於憲法頒佈後六個月內，依憲法之規定選舉召集之。對於舊代表的效力，則認爲不能否認。張氏之言，大意是說，社會上有一種見解。以爲弟一屆已經選出的國民大會代表應該重選，這種見解，我們政府以及執政的黨，也很重視，也曾加以考慮，但是考慮的結果，對於過去已經依法選出的代表沒有理由不承認他們的代表資格。原因有二：一是根據法理上來講，二是根據情理以及現在政治情勢來講。先從第一點來說，我們在法律上找不出根據來。我們看修正後的國民大會組織法，其第一條規定「國民大會制定憲法並決定憲法施行日期」。第十一條規定「國民大會於會期完畢，任務終了」。根據這兩條條文，國民大會的職權是制定憲法，並決定憲法施行日期。國民大會代表祇有這種任務，沒有任期，這種任務，政府沒有法律根據可以解除它。再從第二點來講，以現在政治上一般趨勢來看，目前國家所希求的是團給統一，國家安定，而來開協商會議，假定說過去己經依法選出的九百幾十位代表，政府或任何方面不承認他們的代表資格，而從新選舉，試想這幾百位代表心理上將作何感想？今天我們認爲各黨派在過去彼此對終政治主張見解未能完全一致，尚且要苦心孤詣由政府來召集政治協商會議，然則這九百幾十位代表資格是否認或是取消，他們是不是也要組織一個團體，假定例如組織一個國民大會黨，同樣與其他黨派向政府表示它的意見和願望，再來開一個甚至幾個席上會議，政府將何以處置？所以政府對法律上既無根據，在情理上及今日政治情勢上，亦不能不承認過去已選出的代表是有效的。　　陳立夫在政治協商會議發表他對國民大會問題長篇的意見，（這是他第一次在政治協商會議的發言）其中有一段，說道選舉法第二條第四項由政府指派代表二百四十人，是一補救辦法。這種辦法，雖非絕對良好，但適合中國國情，因我國與歐美不同，每有當選資格且應當選者，常自視清高不願競選，所以不能不有此辦法以資補救。至於代表任期原文沒有明白規定，故有爭議。有人謂十年以前所選代表，依憲草任期六年的規定，早已屆滿，然不知任期應從就任日起草，今國大尚未召開，渠等亦未就任，則任期不但未滿，且實未開始，何況抗戰八年，舊代表的未就仕是特殊情形，至於憲草尚未依法通過，更不能據以限制代表的任期。　　吳鐵城對於維持舊代表一點，更作補充意見，謂反對舊代表理由，不外兩點，一是二十五年所舉代表，不足以代表今日民意，一是當年無選舉權或被選舉權者今多已取得，不應剝奪其權利。對第一點，當年所選代表，八年來多參加抗戰服務，渠等所得經騐與認識，均巳提高，更足以代表民意。對第二點，今日取得選舉或被選舉資格者，究不能超過當年有選舉或被選舉權的人數，不應祇顧及少數人的權利，而不承認已得選舉權者的選舉結果。　　第二，共產黨及民主同盟是不承認舊代表的效力的。他們反對舊代表的理由，已具見於上節所述的民主同盟宣言中，他們在政治協商會議中所持的見解，仍以此爲主要的內容。鄧穎超則在會中更提出了代表選舉法中推選代表的手續太繁雜等問題。吳玉章·張君勵·郭沬若等提出了不能談法統，要顧事實的主張，如談法統，政治協商會議便於法無據，現在事實需要才開政治協商會議，重選舊代表業是事實需要，因此法統之說不能成立。郭沫若謂政府要維持舊代表有效，是怕舊代表說話，引起社會不安定；各黨派要重選代表，也是怕引起社會不安定，人民要說話。羅隆基代表民主同盟提出以下各點：（一）如維持舊代表，則須舉行民意測驗，由工商，文化，學生等知識分子舉行；（二）以舊代表爲候選人，舉辦雜選；（三）不開國民大會，由專家制憲，公民表決。其辦法的不切實際是不待言的。　　第三，無黨無派的王雲五及邵從恩則另外提出了兩個調解案。王氏說政府有困難是事實，共產黨的批評亦對。他執掌法律與事實應該兼顧。他認爲民主的基礎，係在法治，侗抹煞法律，則這種民治實不可靠，法治的精神，人民應守法，政府亦應守法，政府不能隨便否定法律，否則與民主立場衝突，他承認國大組織法有一缺點，即代表無一定任期，又無取消代表資格辦法，渠贊成予以修改，但過去所選代表，不能不維持。爲，國民黨既要還政於民，這就有權作如何處理，再加上二五〇名未選出，因此名額中還有九五〇名有文章可做。邵從恩主張在野黨派在舊代表問題上對執政黨應該讓步。並提出了一個據他自己說費了一夜苦思而想得的辦法，即以現在起以三個會議解決此問題：（一）第一個會讖即政治協商會議，其任務爲各黨派互相擬定民主開始步驟，起草改正國大組織法及選舉法乃至憲草大綱，提出一提案；（二）第二個會議仍照政府主張，於五月五日召開，將吾人所改正的組織法，選舉法及憲草提交談會討論，決定作爲正式的組織法選舉法及憲草。（三）第三個會議即根據第二個會議決定之組織法選舉法成立之會議，其任務爲制憲與行憲。　　國民大會問題在如上所述各方面各持所見的情形之下，討論兩日，米獲結論。　　各黨派的名額分配問題　　政治協商會議對於國民大會一案的論爭，初則以舊代表的存廢問題爲中心，繼則又牽連到各黨派的名額分配問題。至一月二十八日，民主同盟仍堅決認爲不能承認法統，而應承認政治團結之需要，主張政治解決，並重視憲草修改原則等項協議的保障，（即要求政府保障五五之國民大會能接受政治協商會議所議定的憲草修改原則。）根據此所謂「政治妥協」的原則，民盟承認舊代表可以作爲國民黨一黨所推選，各黨派及無黨派當另推選新增代表。民盟並主張俟憲草審議委員會根據協商之修改原則而擬就新憲草時再討諭舊代表問題。復提議各黨派及無黨派推選出之新增代表名額應佔全體名額三分之一以上，用意在保證新憲草不被五五大會否決，因政協會議此時已有三分之二以上之代表同意可不通過憲草的規定。對於以上的意見，因國民黨方面未能同意，故亦未能獲致協議。至於各黨派爭取代表名額，自更談不到有什麼結果了。按政治協商會議，原定一月二十三日閉幕，因種種問題的難得協議，一再展期，截至三十一日早晨止，五項議題之四已完成協議三天了，只有國大問題仍在擱淺中，此日周恩來自延安向中共中央請示後返渝，於是泱定綜合紐與國大組舉行聯席會議，國大問題至此方告解決。政協會議亦即於一月三十一日的晚間閉幕。通過了如下的政治協商會議國大分組委員會的報告。　　本組奉交討論「國民大會問題」，經根據孫會員科等八人所提「關於國民大會之意見」，開會六次，並與綜合分組委員會聯合舉行會議一次，詳加商討，已獲結果，謹具報告，敬祈公決。召集人：余家菊，鄧穎超。一，民國三十五年五月五日召開國民大會。二，第一屆國民大之會職權爲制定憲法。三，憲法之通過，須經出席代表四分之三之同意爲之。四，依選舉法規定之區域及職業代表一千二百名照舊。五，合灣東北等新增各該區域及其職業代表共一百五十名。六，增加黨派及社會賢達代表七百名，其分配另定之。七，總計國民大會之代表爲二千零五十名。八，依據憲法規定之行憲機關，於憲法頒佈六個月內，依憲法之規定選舉召集之。　　我們讀政筋會的報告，一則規定國民大會於五月五日召開，二則明定國民大會之職權爲制定憲法，這些本都是政府所願望，所努力，所製成命令，所立成法律，並且爲政府在政協會中所提出的。關於國大代表的名額，政府原祇期望維特舊代表並使之合理的增加新代表，協商的結果，不特承認九百幾十名已經選出的代表爲有效，其未經選出的二百幾十名亦仍由政府俠法公開選舉。此外增加了各黨派及無黨派代表七百名與台灣，東北等地代表一百五十名，取消了當然代表及指定代表。這種合理的增加，其實已早爲政府宣示了的。剩下的問題，就是這七百名代表該如何分配了。共產黨說他們的代表總數應爲國民黨代表總數之半，青年黨先說他們的代表應爲總數的十分之一，後來又推翻了自己所提的比例，而要求該黨應推選五百名代表；同時各黨各派一方面要求佔全數代表的三分之一，而另一方面共產黨又單獨要求佔全數的四分之一，除了這些名額比列的爭執以外，還要求國民黨應保證某黨派的代表，一定要佔幾分之幾。政協會議閉幕以後，各方迭有會商，終決定黨派與社會賢達七百名代表名額之分配數字爲：國民黨二二〇名，共產黨一百九十名，民主同盟一百名，靑年黨一百二十名，無黨派人士七十名。　　國民大會的組識及代表選舉法的演變至此遂成定型。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Government Accepts Mediation Advice, National Assembly Postponed Three Days, Awaiting Party Representative Lists <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 11th] The National Government issued an order on the 11th of November, 35th year of the Republic, that the National Assembly, originally scheduled to convene on the 15th of November, 35th year of the Republic, is hereby reordered.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 11th] The National Assembly has decided to postpone for three days, setting the opening ceremony for the 15th. It is reported that (1) this is in accordance with the request of the mediators; (2) due to the representatives not yet having arrived, this is the result of efforts made by representatives of social leaders, Wang Yunwu and Qian Xinzhi, when they visited the Chairman's official residence at 9:20 on the 11th. The government solemnly issued a clear order at midnight regarding the postponement, in order to make it known to all.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 11th] Social leaders conveyed the opinions of the Third Side, requesting that the opening date of the National Assembly be postponed for two or three days, to wait for the various parties to submit their lists. The government, finding their request sincere and noting that many representatives were still en route, has accepted this suggestion and changed the opening date to the 15th.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 11th] Representatives of social leaders made their greatest efforts on the 11th, working for peace, hoping that all parties could participate in this constitution-drafting National Assembly. At 8 o'clock, social leaders, the Youth Party, and representatives of the Democratic League gathered at the Bank of Communications to discuss the matter of requesting the government to postpone the National Assembly, and expressed their opinions enthusiastically. Finally, it was decided to ask the government to postpone it to December 1st, and a letter was drafted, signed by six people including Zhang Junmai of the Democratic League, and social leaders Miao Jiaming, Hu Lin, Qian Xinzhi, and Mo Dehui were sent to visit the Chairman, talking until 12 o'clock. Lei Zhen, Secretary-General of the Political Consultative Conference, went to the Bank of Communications and first met with Luo Longji and Mo Dehui. At 1 o'clock in the afternoon, Communist Party representatives Zhou Enlai, Dong Biwu, and Li Weihan also arrived and held discussions. At 4 o'clock, Mo Dehui and others visited the Chairman and made a second suggestion regarding postponing the National Assembly. The letter originally intended to be brought was changed to an oral statement due to circumstances, and the postponement was changed to three days. At that time, the Chairman said that this opinion was very good, and hoped that Mo and others would make a final effort. They immediately returned to the Bank of Communications to report to the representatives who were in the meeting. Because the Chairman had not yet made a final decision, they gathered again. At 9:20, Wang Yunwu and Qian Xinzhi were sent to visit the Chairman again. The Chairman agreed to postpone for three days. After they returned, Hu and Miao visited Zhou Enlai to convey this news.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 11th] All the National Assembly representatives are scheduled to visit the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum at 9 a.m. on the 12th, and hold a preparatory meeting at 4 p.m.</p>
<p>Opening Ceremony Temporary Chairman – Publicly Recommended Chairman Chiang</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 11th] Hong Lanyou, Secretary-General of the National Assembly Preparatory Committee, held a tea party at the National Assembly Hall at 4 p.m. on the 11th, inviting representatives from various places in Beijing. More than 1,000 people attended. Regarding the issue of the temporary chairman of the National Assembly opening ceremony, Hong said in his speech: The Preparatory Committee had signed two suggestions to the National Government, (1) requesting the Chairman of the National Government to be the temporary chairman of the opening ceremony; (2) recommending a senior among the representatives as the temporary chairman. Subsequently, Chairman Chiang resigned, willing to attend the opening ceremony as the Chairman of the National Government, hoping that the representatives would have a common opinion on this. At this point, Wu Zhaoxu, Yu Bin, Xi Yushu, Chang Zonghui, Chen Ziji and others expressed their opinions one after another. As a result, they unanimously voted to ask Chairman Chiang of the National Government to be the temporary chairman of the opening ceremony of the National Assembly. As for the question of whether a representative needs to give a speech at the opening ceremony, a heated discussion was also held.

<p>[Central News Agency, This City News] Wang Zhiyuan, Guangxi National Assembly representative and current president of Guangzhou University, and Cao Rukang, overseas Chinese National Assembly representative from Myanmar, flew to Shanghai together from Guangdong by plane at 5 p.m. on the 11th, and took the night train to Beijing to attend the National Assembly. Before the trip, they spoke to reporters from the Central News Agency about their views on constitutional government and the constitution. Wang said: The National Assembly is about to open, and the government is determined to return power to the people. People across the country are happy and celebrating together. I hope that all parties and factions can participate as scheduled and jointly promote the realization of the overall situation of peaceful unification. As for how to implement the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, we do not want to express opinions, because they are not related to the nature of the National Assembly. Regarding the constitutional draft, we in Guangdong have conducted detailed discussions by all representatives of the Guangdong Branch of the National Assembly Representatives Friendship Association, and have completed the organization of the records, preparing to provide them to the conference for discussion. Generally speaking, the content of the May 5th Constitutional Draft is quite complete, because this constitutional draft is based on the entire spirit of the Three Principles of the People and the Five-Power Constitution in Dr. Sun Yat-sen's legacy. It has been passed through the three readings of the Legislative Yuan. In the future, it will be submitted to the General Assembly to further integrate the opinions of all parties and all representatives, and a complete Constitution of the Republic of China will surely be produced. And this constitution is more advanced than the constitutions of advanced countries such as the United Kingdom and the United States. As for the first thing we should pay attention to after the future implementation of constitutional government, we believe that the first thing to pay attention to is the popularization of education, because the foundation of democratic politics lies in the development of national education. Education and politics and economics are mutually supportive and cannot be separated. Wang also said: The general public often says that "there are too many illiterate people in China." I personally think that the word "blind" is not appropriate, because there can be "martial blind" people, and even other aspects of "blindness." In fact, the so-called "illiteracy" is all because the country has failed to work hard on popularizing education in the past, and it cannot be blamed on individuals who are illiterate. It is stimulating to use the word "blind," so we must eliminate this word as soon as possible in the future so that everyone can receive education. As for the focus of future education, I personally think that we must pay attention to two points: (1) School education should be coordinated with family education and social education. Second, moral, intellectual, and physical education should be developed equally. Wang also mentioned the development of Guangzhou University in the past 20 years. It has now completed the three colleges of liberal arts, science, and business, and twelve departments. Recently, it plans to expand the College of Arts and Sciences. After going to Beijing, it will ask the Ministry of Education for instructions. Cao said: Regarding how to implement constitutional government, Cao's opinion is that there must first be a complete constitution. This constitution will be produced at this National Assembly. After the constitution is produced, the whole country must follow it consistently without exception, because the foundation of constitutional government lies in strict rule of law.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 11th] 37 legislators, including Jian Guan-san and Xu Yuan-gao, submitted a letter to President Sun and Vice President Wei on the 11th, requesting that they urge the Central Government to quickly approve the matter of listing all legislators as National Assembly representatives. The original text is as follows: "There are only two ways to enact a constitution in various countries of the world: one is to submit the completed draft constitution to the people for referendum, and the other is to organize a penal law conference to discuss and enact the constitution. This National Assembly is convened specifically for the purpose of constitutional deliberation. The Legislative Yuan has drafted the constitution in the past and has been ordered to revise it later. Our colleagues in the Legislative Yuan have already shouldered half of the responsibility of constitutional deliberation, and logically become the innate representatives of the National Assembly, which is specifically for constitutional deliberation. The President is requested to urge the Central Government to approve it today, so as to facilitate the process of constitution-making, and the need for instructions is most urgent."</p>
<h3 id="e9">Informal Military Three-Person Meeting, Government Proposes Ceasefire Measures, Communist Party Still Needs to Request Instructions and Has Not Made a Decision <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 11th] The informal military three-person meeting was held at Special Envoy Marshall's residence at 10 a.m. on the 11th. Special Envoy Marshall, Government Representative Yu Dawei (representing Xu Yongchang), Communist Party Representative Zhou Enlai, and Chief of Staff Chen Cheng, Guo, Deputy Director of the Fifth Department of the National Government, Pi Zonggan, and Xu Langxuan, Director of the Third Beauty Department of the Ministry of National Defense, and Zhang Wenjin, translator of the Communist Party Delegation, also attended the meeting. The meeting adjourned at 12 noon. At the meeting, the government representatives formally presented concrete ceasefire measures. The Communist Party representatives stated that they would need to request instructions from Yan'an before making a decision. The date for the second meeting has not been decided, but both parties can decide to convene at any time if they feel the need.</p>
<h3 id="e10">Yan'an Has Not Yet Issued Ceasefire Order to Communist Army <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 11th] The ceasefire order issued by the government became effective at 12 noon on the 11th, but as of now, Yan'an has not issued a ceasefire order to the Communist Army. The reporter specifically visited an observer to inquire about his opinion. According to him: Stopping the conflict is a unanimous demand of the people of the whole country. After stopping the conflict, it will not only reduce the suffering of the people, but also have a good impact on politics. Therefore, the ceasefire order issued by the government this time is necessary from any point of view. However, this ceasefire order was issued by the government on its own initiative. In order to actually stop the conflict, it is necessary to negotiate with the Chinese Communists. I hope that the Chinese Communists can also order their troops to stop attacking the National Army. The government has notified Marshal and the Chinese Communist representative Zhou Enlai, and held a three-person meeting at 3 p.m. on the 11th to informally discuss the ceasefire issue. The results of the informal three-person group are not yet known. According to past regulations on ceasefire measures, it can be implemented in the following ways: First, both sides of the army will stop the conflict on the spot and wait for the three-person group to go. Second, the three-person meeting will stipulate the location for both sides to withdraw their troops. Third, if there are differences between the two sides, the three-person group will decide. The above methods were stipulated in the past, and can be handled in this way at present. However, it is not yet known whether Yan'an can express the same child on this point. If only the government army unilaterally ceases fire, and the Communist army still does not stop attacking the National Army, then the conflict will inevitably continue to occur.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 11th] The Legislative Yuan held a temporary meeting on the 11th. After discussing routine cases (see the second edition for the discussion of routine cases), the meeting was adjourned for an hour and reopened at 7 p.m. to review the draft amendment to the May 5th Constitutional Draft, with Sun Ke presiding and Wang Chonghui and Wu Jingxiong in attendance. First, Sun Ke gave a speech explaining the revision process of the constitutional draft, stating that the draft amendment to the May 5th Constitutional Draft was proposed by the Constitutional Draft Review Committee of the Political Consultative Conference. When the conference was held in Chongqing, some revision opinions were provided. Later, Wang Xianhui, Lei Zhen, and Wu Jingxiong sorted out the review opinions at that time. The chairman recently wired this hospital that the National Assembly will be convened soon, and that constitution-making is the only work of the conference, instructing this hospital to expedite the review of the draft amendment to the May 5th Constitutional Draft so that it can be used for discussion at the National Assembly.</p>
<h3 id="e16">There Are Two Opinions on Whether to Go Through Legislative Procedures <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>There are two opinions on whether the amendment should go through legislative procedures: First, it is considered unnecessary to go through legislative procedures, and the May 5th Constitutional Draft ten years ago can be used as a blueprint; second, it is considered that it should go through legislative procedures. According to the first method, there may be problems in the future. Due to political changes, the situation ten years ago is different from today, and the domestic situation at that time is also different from the current situation. In order to adapt to the domestic situation, the original draft needs to be substantially revised, so it must go through legislative procedures. It should be pointed out that this amendment is one case, not two cases. The chairman adopted the second proposition and wired this hospital to complete the legislative procedure for the final amendment.</p>
<h3 id="e17">All Work to Be Completed Within This Week <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>The chairman had previously limited this hospital to complete this work before the 15th of this month. The current situation is slightly different, and the time can also be slightly relaxed. In any case, all the work will be completed this week. Since there is more time, we can discuss it at length. Many members of the Huai Legislative Committee did not participate in the revision work and were not very clear about the process, so Wang Xian et al. were invited to the meeting to explain. After the speech, the review procedure was discussed, whether to hold a plenary review meeting first, and then conduct group reviews. First, Liu Guanyun spoke, saying that this hospital had discussed the May 5th Constitutional Draft early, and consulted the opinions of various provinces. In the past year or two, the general public has known it in great detail. Will today's major changes cause people across the country to doubt it? In the past, drafting constitutions was based on the Five-Power Constitution, and the Three Principles of the People were promoted by the Five Powers, but the current draft amendment is nominally the Three Principles of the People and ignores the Five-Power Constitution. This is indeed a problem. Sun Ke replied that what is being discussed at the moment is the procedural issue, and requested that the speech on the content issue be suspended. Liu still spoke generously. Finally, the chairman stopped Liu's speech, and Liu angrily withdrew from the meeting. Finally, it was decided that a joint review meeting of the five committees of Finance, Economy, Military Affairs, Foreign Affairs, and Law would be held at 9 a.m. on the 13th, convened by Lin Bin, Chairman of the Legislative Affairs Committee. At that time, Wang Chonghui et al. were invited to report, and the review procedure was decided later. The meeting adjourned at about 8 p.m.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 11th] The Central Memorial Week and the inauguration ceremony of National Government member Chen Qicai and others were held at the National Government Auditorium at 9 a.m. on the 11th.

The chairman personally bestowed the seal. After the oath-takers raised their right hands to take the oath, Commissioner Zhang Ji gave a speech, saying that this newspaper has served the country for 50 years and has fought hard under the leadership of the Premier and the President. The National Assembly will be convened tomorrow, and the period of political tutelage will come to an end. Our party has established the country through many hardships, and it is not true that we are a one-party dictatorship in accordance with the spirit of the Prime Minister's will, "the world is for all." Over the years, the government has appointed many non-party members to participate in the government, which is evidence of this. Commissioner Zhang also said that the President has given us many instructions, but the two words "know shame" and "self-confidence" must be kept in mind and strictly followed. Although the Anti-Japanese War has been won, the foundation for national construction has not yet been laid. Our party comrades and the people of the country have this feeling. How should we work hard and shoulder this important mission? Our party comrades and the people of the country should all bear this responsibility. We must have the determination of self-confidence and firm belief in doctrine and strive hard. The chairman then gave a speech, exhorting the oath-takers to abide by the oath, be loyal and responsible, and finally exhorted them to work hard to carry out the two words "work together to complete the revolutionary mission." Chen Qicai, on behalf of the oath-takers, gave a reply, expressing his respectful acceptance of the instructions from the supervisor and the chairman. The ceremony took four minutes and was completed.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Changchun, November 11th] Commander Sun Liren told reporters: After receiving the order to cease conflict issued by Chairman Chiang, he is determined to adhere to the government's consistent policy of peaceful resolution. If the Communist army does not invade the National Army, the National Army will not advance a single step.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, November 11th] After the Commander-in-Chief's Headquarters issued the ceasefire order to the front lines, many military leaders gathered at the Commander-in-Chief's residence at noon on the 11th for discussions.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, November 11th] Zheng Jiemin, the government member of the Military Mediation Executive Headquarters, officially prepared a memorandum of the government's ceasefire order at 9:00 AM on the 11th and submitted it to General Gillem, the American member, for transfer to Ye Jianying, the Communist Party member. At the same time, he also notified the groups distributed in North China. As of 5:00 PM on the 11th, the Communist Party had not responded to this memorandum in any way. Government member Zheng Jiemin received the directive solely from Chairman Chiang to the government side of the Executive Headquarters on the evening of the 10th. In addition to elaborating on the significance of the ceasefire, the directive stated: "The government has notified Marshal Marshall and informed the Communist Party of this ceasefire order and to promptly send personnel to participate in the Military Three-Man Group to jointly discuss specific ceasefire measures." Committee Member Zheng Jiemin told reporters: "The Executive Headquarters hopes to hold a Three-Committee meeting on the 11th to discuss the ceasefire. In the future, the Military Mediation Department will still be the supervisory ceasefire agency, and the local peace groups will be adjusted and strengthened." Currently, there are only eleven groups remaining within the borders (including Rehe). Moreover, except for the five groups in Handan, Xinxiang, Taiyuan, Qin County, and Botou, where the three parties are fully represented, the Communist Party representatives have not participated in the groups in Shijiazhuang, Nankou, Jinan, Xuzhou, Chaoyang, and Huaiyang.</p>

<h3 id="e24">The Legislative Yuan Revises and Passes the Feast and Entertainment Tax Law; Draft Regulations on House Tax Also Revised <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, November 11th] The Legislative Yuan held its third temporary meeting at 3:00 PM on the afternoon of the 11th. Seventy-three legislators, including Lin Bin, Zhao Xunyu, and Liu Keshu, attended. President Sun was absent due to another meeting and was chaired by Vice President Wei Daoming.</p>
<p>First, the remaining cases from the 311th meeting were discussed. The most intense debate was on the Organization Regulations of the Industry and Commerce Guidance Department of the Ministry of Economic Affairs. Lin Bin, the Chairman of the Legal System Committee, explained that the institution used very few personnel, focused on technology, and its object was only to assist private industries, so it should be allowed to be established. Chen Guyuan and others stated that they did not object, but believed that Nanjing and Shanghai were the locations of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and it seemed unnecessary to set up guidance departments in the above two places. Other construction halls and social bureaus also paid attention to guidance work, and there was no need to set up another institution. The committee members also spoke enthusiastically about whether it should be called a "Guidance Department" or maintain the original name "Supervision Department," with most opposing the use of the word "Supervision," as it would be tantamount to returning to the old path of control. As a result, the review proposal was passed, and it was still called the "Industry and Commerce Guidance Department."</p>
<p>The amendment of the License Tax Law also attracted attention. It was resolved that the annual tax for each small car used for business purposes should not exceed 30,000 yuan, the annual tax for large cars should not exceed 50,000 yuan, the annual tax for freight cars should be the same, the annual tax for motorcycles should not exceed 5,001 yuan, and the annual tax for rickshaws should not exceed 5,000 yuan, but tricycles can be increased to one-half. Those used for private purposes shall be taxed at one-half of those used for business purposes.</p>
<p>When discussing the revised Feast and Entertainment Tax Law, Situ De, Fu Tongxian, and others strongly argued for the exemption of entertainment tax on musical performances, believing that this matter was of great importance to the future of music in China and must be exempted. Some committee members also expressed dissent on the imposition of donations on entertainment not for profit. As a result, the following supplement was added to Article 4, Paragraph 1: "However, all musical performances and entertainment not for profit shall be exempt from entertainment tax." The maximum amount of entertainment tax was originally "not exceeding 50% of the original price," but the revised draft was changed to 30%. During today's meeting, it was decided to change it to 25%.</p>
<p>During the meeting, the exemption of house tax was also discussed in detail. For the revised Article 6, Paragraph 2 of the House Tax Regulations: "Houses for residents' own use, not exceeding three rooms per person," it was generally believed that three rooms were too many, and it was decided to change it to "not exceeding one room per person" for exemption. However, in the first paragraph, the house tax was exempted.</p>
<p>When discussing the revision of the Commodity Tax Regulations, in addition to resolving to exempt cosmetic taxes on five kinds of cosmetics such as vanishing cream, the words "and others designated by the Ministry of Finance" in Paragraphs (5), (9), (11), and (13) of Article 3 were either canceled to avoid abuses.</p>
<h3 id="e25">Compilation of Passed Major Cases <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, November 11th] The cases passed by the Legislative Yuan's temporary meeting on the 11th are as follows: (1) Report of the Legal System Committee on the review of the amendment to Article 11 of the Organization Law of the Control Yuan; (2) Report of the Legal System Committee on the review of the draft Organization Regulations of the National History Museum; (3) Report of the Legal System Committee and the Economic Committee on the review of the draft Organization Regulations of the Industry and Commerce Supervision Department of the Ministry of Economic Affairs; (4) Report of the Finance Committee on the review of the draft Slaughter Tax Law; (5) Report of the Finance Committee on the review of the revised Business License Tax Law; (6) Report of the Finance Committee on the review of the revised Vehicle License Tax Law; (7) Report of the Finance Committee on the review of the revised Feast and Entertainment Tax Law; (8) Report of the Finance Committee on the review of the revised House Tax Regulations; (9) Joint review by the Foreign Affairs Committee and the Legal System Committee on the case of abolishing the Regulations on the Handling of Enemy Nationals; (10) Joint report by the Military Affairs Committee and the Legal System Committee on the review of the draft Organization Regulations of the Strategic Advisory Committee; (11) Joint report by the Finance Committee and the Economic Committee on the review of the draft amendment to the Commodity Tax Regulations. Cases (1), (7), (8), (10), and (11) were passed after being amended by the General Assembly. In addition, the Civil Law Committee and the National Law Committee jointly reported on the case proposed by Committee Member Chen An and others to draft a jury system. The review result was roughly that the rule of law in our country is not yet fully developed, and the people's legal knowledge is not yet widespread. At this time, if the jury system is forcibly implemented, jurors are easily threatened by bribery and manipulation, and the result will not only fail to assist judges in judging the facts, but the judges will be restrained and dragged down by it. Therefore, the jury system seems to have more disadvantages than advantages. According to the current situation in our country, it is still difficult to implement it for a while. The case was not passed by public decision. Regarding the case of the Foreign Affairs Committee and the Legal System Committee jointly reviewing the abolition of the Enemy Nationals Disposal Regulations, the review result was that the Enemy Nationals Disposal Regulations can be abolished because most of the Japanese and German nationals have been repatriated, and Italy has restored diplomatic relations. However, the Enemy Property Disposal Regulations cannot be replaced because the "Measures for Handling Enemy and Puppet Properties in Recovered Areas" promulgated by the Executive Yuan has not undergone legislative procedures. The Executive Yuan should be requested to draft the measures into draft regulations and send them to the Legislative Yuan for deliberation before approval.</p>

Wang Jingwei's remnants should be severely punished.</p>

<h3 id="e29">If Sentencing for Traitors is Too Light or Too Heavy, An Application for Retrial Can Be Filed According to Law; Zhao Chen Hopes That All Parties Will Provide More Evidence <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, November 11th] In the midst of the active trial of traitors across the country, the severity of sentencing in adjudicated cases has attracted considerable attention from the people. This reporter specifically inquired about the situation of the cases already judged by the Capital High Court from the High Procuratorate and the High Court. He Zhongjin, the Director of the High Procuratorate, said: "If the prosecutor believes that the sentencing in a adjudicated case is too light or too heavy, an application for retrial can be filed according to law. Wang Wenjun, the prosecutor in charge of Wang Shijing's case, has already applied to the High Court for a retrial of Wang's case on the 8th of this month. Chen Shengzu, the prosecutor in charge of Deng Fuyu's and Pan Yugui's cases, is in the process of applying for a retrial of Deng's case and has also decided to apply for a retrial of Pan's case after receiving the judgment. The original prosecutors in charge of these three cases all believe that the sentencing was too light." Zhao Chen, the President of the High Court, told reporters: "Regarding the two main sentences in special criminal cases, namely death penalty and life imprisonment, the judgment of the High Court cannot be regarded as the final determination. After the High Court's judgment, regardless of whether the parties apply for a retrial, the court should apply for a retrial on its behalf according to law. The final determination must be decided by the Supreme Court. The High Court's judgments are based on the evidence presented by the plaintiffs and defendants. Therefore, I sincerely hope that all responsible parties will provide more evidence to assist the country in eliminating traitors to clarify right and wrong."</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, November 11th] Gu Yuxiu, Director of the Shanghai Education Bureau, who went to Europe and the United States for a study tour, has returned to China after completing his work and has come to Beijing to report on his work.</p>
<p>Mr. Gu spoke with reporters about the current status of atomic energy research in various countries and sincerely said that universities in Europe and the United States made great contributions to national defense science during the war. After the war, various research works are still in progress, especially the research on atomic energy, which is particularly successful. The largest atomic energy laboratory in the United States is at the California Institute of Technology, and it is headed by Professor (EO) Lawrence, who won the Nobel Prize. The world's largest atomic fissioner is placed in this room, weighing 4,000 tons and with a diameter of 184 feet. Recently, two Chinese professors have assisted Lawrence's work, one is Ren Zhigong, a radio professor at Tsinghua University, and the other is Zeng Zhaoyu, a professor at Peking University. When the US Navy conducted an atomic bomb explosion experiment on Bikini Atoll, China had two professors, Zhao Zhongyao and Wu Dayou, who went to observe and gained a lot. Second only to California's equipment is Princeton's atomic energy laboratory. Professor Lawrence hopes that China can send 30 students to study in various atomic energy laboratories in the United States. The research on atomic energy in the United Kingdom, France, and Switzerland has also had special success. According to experimental results, European and American atomic energy experts have confirmed the possibility of atomic energy being applied to construction, especially in medicine and biology.</p>

The propaganda agency he presided over was extremely large. After the victory, he changed his attitude and assisted underground workers, but it was purely opportunistic. Even if the newspaper society he presided over had done some good deeds, it was personal benevolence and could not make up for the great fault of treason.

<p>The Military Intelligence Bureau Requests the Death Penalty in the Transfer Order</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 11th] The case of Ding Mocun, the ringleader of the "76th" Special Agents, was publicly prosecuted on the 11th by Chen Shengzu, the prosecutor of the Capital High Court. All documents will be transferred to the court on the 13th. Ding Mocun was among the four traitors, including Zhou Fohai, who were escorted from Chongqing to Nanjing for trial. He is the last to be publicly prosecuted. The evidence against him has been fully prepared after two months of investigation and collection. The evidence provided by the Military Intelligence Bureau is the most important. His speculative behavior after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War is not enough to cover up his crimes of harming underground workers of the central government. According to reliable sources obtained by our reporter, the Military Intelligence Bureau has explicitly requested the judicial authorities to impose the death penalty in the transfer document, in order to appease the loyal comrades who died for the country. The full text of the indictment issued by the prosecutor of the Capital High Court is recorded below:</p>
<p>Defendant Ding Mocun, male, 44 years old, from Changde County, Hunan Province, residing at No. 1010, Yuanyuan Road, Shanghai, serving as the head of the puppet special agents and the puppet governor of Zhejiang Province, etc.</p>
<p>After the conclusion of the investigation, it is deemed that prosecution is warranted. The criminal facts, evidence, and the applicable laws are stated as follows:</p>
<p>(Criminal Facts)</p>
<p>Ding Mocun was originally a member of the Chinese Kuomintang and served as the director of the Third Division of the Investigation and Statistics Bureau of the former Military Affairs Commission. In August of the 27th year of the Republic of China, the bureau was ordered to reorganize, and the Third Division was abolished. Ding Mocun, feeling resentful, used the excuse of going south, transferred from Hankou to Hong Kong and then to Shanghai, colluding with the Japanese invaders and betraying China. The enemy invaders also believed that Ding Mocun was originally a special agent of our central government and knew very well the organizational situation of our special agent departments and the intelligence stations set up in various places. Therefore, they utilized him to carry out the vicious plan of using special agents to control special agents. In the spring of the 28th year of the Republic of China, Wang Zhaoming, Chen Gongbo, Zhou Fohai, and other traitors, under the protection of the Japanese invaders, secretly arrived in Shanghai, advocating "peaceful nation-building," "Sino-Japanese friendship," and "East Asian co-prosperity," and promoted the peace movement. Ding Mocun was again directed by the Japanese invaders to participate in the activities and was promoted as a standing committee member of the puppet Central Executive Committee and the Minister of the Social Affairs Department of the puppet Central Party Headquarters at the Sixth Puppet National Congress of the Kuomintang. During his tenure in the puppet position, he published fallacies and misled people. He also organized the puppet Special Agents Headquarters at No. 76, Jessfield Road in Shanghai, serving as the director. He painstakingly harmed underground workers of our central government, arrested patriotic heroes, sabotaged our intelligence agencies, and obstructed resistance to the enemy, to the extreme. On March 30th of the 29th year of the Republic of China, the puppet National Government was established in Nanjing, and Ding Mocun was appointed as the Minister of Social Affairs of the puppet Executive Yuan and a member of the puppet Central Political Committee, participating in the decision-making of the puppet government's highest national policies and various traitorous decrees and treaties. In September of the 30th year, he was transferred to the Minister of the Puppet Ministry of Transportation, in the 32nd year he was transferred to the Minister of Puppet Ministry of Social Welfare, in January of the 34th year he concurrently served as the Secretary-General of the Puppet Supreme National Defense Council, in March of the same year he also concurrently served as the Deputy Supervisor of the Puppet Political Security Department, and in January of the same year he was transferred to the Governor of the Puppet Seaport Province and concurrently served as the Puppet Pacification Director stationed in Hangzhou. He implemented political orders to enslave the people in accordance with the enemy's and puppets' wishes. Also in the summer of that year, together with Nakajima Shinichi, a special agent of the Japanese invaders, he believed that the signs of the enemy's defeat were already apparent, but still wanted to create a way out after their downfall. He collected scattered soldiers and ruffians and organized a commando general team, attempting to carry out guerrilla warfare in the coastal areas of eastern Zhejiang after our Allied forces landed, in order to contain the combat power of our Allied forces. After the victory, he was induced and arrested by the former Investigation and Statistics Bureau of the Military Affairs Commission and escorted to the court for investigation.</p>
<p>(Two) Evidence and Legal Provisions</p>
<p>The defendant in this case, Ding Mocun, served as the director of the Puppet Special Agents Headquarters, participated in the Puppet National Government, and successively held puppet positions such as standing committee member of the Central Executive Committee, Minister of the Social Affairs Department of the Central Party Headquarters, Minister of the Social Affairs Department of the Executive Yuan, member of the Central Political Committee, Minister of the Ministry of Transportation, Minister of the Ministry of Social Welfare, Secretary-General of the Supreme National Defense Council, Deputy Supervisor of the Political Security Department, and Governor of Zhejiang Province and concurrently stationed in Hangzhou, Pacification Director, etc., he repeatedly confessed without denial. In addition, the puppet Administrative Gazette of the investigated case records the defendant's attendance at various meetings in the capacity of a puppet minister, as well as the records of the puppet Central China Current Situation published in Showa 17, and the Commemorative Album of the Return of the Puppet National Government to the Capital, which publishes the defendant's various speeches, all of which are consistent with his confession, and the facts are extremely clear. The special agent agencies under the puppet National Government were puppet organizations manufactured by the enemy country, Japan, and their sole purpose was to undermine our country's war resistance policy and subvert our central government. The defendant was originally a member of the Chinese Kuomintang and served as a senior central government official. At the critical moment when the situation of the War of Resistance turned against us, he actually used excuses to leave, betray his oath and collude with the enemy, plotting against our nation. He served as a key member of the enemy's puppet special agents and puppet government, harming underground workers of our central government, implementing the enemy's and puppets' political orders, and reducing our strength in the War of Resistance. This is not only evidenced by the telegram of the Investigation and Statistics Bureau of the Military Affairs Commission but also by the detailed confessions of the defendant Hu Junhe in another case, which is sufficient to prove it. Moreover, in his New Year's speech in the 33rd year, he also said: "Restoring China and defending East Asia cannot be achieved by mere optimism, but must be exchanged with iron and blood. Although we have invested a lot of manpower and material resources, we cannot be satisfied. The advance troops have not yet reached the strength to fight shoulder to shoulder with friendly forces. In the past year, the government has been actively training troops, building an army, and intensifying the training of young people, all for the purpose of preparing to fight shoulder to shoulder, destroy the United States and Britain, and implement the 'Greater East Asia War.' I hope that the people of the country can understand this. The more strength we have, the more hope we have for the revival of China. The more strength we invest, the more certainty we have of winning the 'Greater East Asia War.' Only with the overall victory of the 'Greater East Asia War' can the entire East Asian nation be truly liberated. We must work together under this understanding," and other similar fallacious words, which are too numerous to mention. His treacherous acts of colluding with the enemy and plotting rebellion are already obvious. Moreover, in the summer of the 34th year, when the signs of the enemy's defeat were already clearly revealed, he still colluded with Nakajima Shinichi, a special agent of the Japanese invaders, and secretly planned to organize a commando general team, attempting to carry out guerrilla warfare after our Allied forces landed in the coastal areas of eastern Zhejiang, in order to contain the combat power of the Allied forces and delay the enemy's collapse, wanting to plunge the people in our war zone into dire straits. Although the defendant vehemently denied this during the interrogation, the facts are very clear based on Nakajima Shinichi's confession in the war crimes military tribunal and Chen Gongshu's report to the Military Intelligence Bureau. The defendant's empty words cannot be used to deny it. From this point of view, his crimes are heinous and cannot be condoned. Although the defendant claimed: (1) He participated in the puppet organization under the coercion of the enemy puppets, but his heart was still towards the central government; (2) In the spring of the 31st year, he entrusted someone to surrender to the central government on his behalf to clarify his intentions; (3) He secretly communicated with the central military and political authorities, established secret radio stations, provided military information to the army, reorganized the puppet army to cooperate with the national army, in order to counterattack, rescue underground workers of the central government, and assist the central government in developing culture and party affairs in the occupied areas; (4) During his tenure, he preserved postal rights, maintained postal and remittance services, improved roads, eliminated corruption and darkness in transportation, worked hard for social welfare, reduced the suffering of the people, cultivated agricultural talents, benefited rural areas, and wiped out bandits to stabilize the local area; (5) After the Japanese invaders surrendered, the defendant followed the central government's instructions to maintain the security of the occupied areas of Zhejiang and the Shanghai-Hangzhou line. When the national army entered Hangzhou, he handed over all the military power under his command to the central government for takeover, which was not without some merit, etc., using these as excuses for exemption from guilt. However, after investigation, (1) his so-called coercion by the enemy puppets is purely empty talk and cannot be adopted. Moreover, he continued to serve in puppet positions for more than six years, and he was transferred to important positions many times. He did not remain untainted and retire to clarify his intentions. It is obvious that he did not act out of coercion. (2) After the defendant joined the rebellion, the Supreme Court Prosecutor's Office had already issued a wanted order on October 2, 28th year. Even if the defendant had entrusted someone to surrender to the central government on his behalf in the spring of the 31st year, it does not meet the conditions for surrendering, which requires automatic surrender to the authorities after the crime is discovered and being subject to trial. Therefore, it cannot be used as a reason for reducing guilt. He colluded with the enemy, presided over special agents, harmed patriots, opposed the war, was pro-Japanese, and betrayed the central government. His crimes are obvious and unforgivable. Even if he had contact with the central military and political authorities and rescued underground workers, it was because he saw that the international situation was clearly unfavorable to the Japanese invaders after the outbreak of the Pacific War. It was nothing more than leaving a way out for himself, hoping to cover up his past mistakes. How can this be used as favorable evidence to seek leniency? (4) The defendant's so-called maintenance of postal and remittance services, improvement of roads, and stabilization of security during his tenure are baseless claims. Even if they were true, they were the duties that should be fulfilled in the puppet position. How can this be used to claim credit? As for the various welfare matters he did for the benefit of the people, although many details are listed, it is still doubtful whether they are real. Even if they are not false, they are only occasional small favors to obedient people. How can small favors cover up his great sins? (5) After the Japanese invaders surrendered, the defendant maintained local security, assisted the central government in taking over, and handed over all the military power under his command. This has indeed been stated by the Investigation and Statistics Bureau of the Military Affairs Commission in the transfer document. However, this was only because the Japanese invaders had already surrendered, and the puppet organization lost its support. The defendant, seeing that the general trend was gone, had no choice but to submit. What merit is there to speak of! In summary, all of the above defenses are attempts to conceal the truth and reduce the sentence. They are not acceptable. His actions constitute a crime under Article 2, Paragraph 1, Item 1 of the Regulations for the Punishment of Traitors. Therefore, in accordance with Article 1 of the Special Criminal Cases Litigation Regulations and Article 230, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law, a direct public prosecution is filed, and you are requested to conduct a trial in accordance with the law.</p>
<h3 id="e40">Editorial: Redouble Our Efforts to Fulfill Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Legacy <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>Today, when the domestic political situation is at a historical juncture, we once again celebrate the birthday of Dr. Sun Yat-sen. Regarding the birth of this national leader, our founding father, and his lifelong struggle, we consider today's situation and feel a multitude of emotions. We truly do not know where to begin with our countless words. The national revolution led by Dr. Sun Yat-sen during his lifetime was a revolution of the Three Principles of the People. Due to his effective leadership and the rise of patriots, he finally overthrew the Qing Dynasty, established the Republic of China, and completed the initial stage of the Three Principles of the People's national revolution. However, the remnants of feudalism persisted, forming a situation of warlord separatism. The achievements of the Xinhai Revolution were almost completely abandoned in an instant. Fortunately, Dr. Sun Yat-sen's struggle rekindled the high tide of the national revolution and launched a fierce battle with the remaining feudal forces. In the autumn of the 13th year of the Republic of China, the situation in the north changed, and Dr. Sun Yat-sen went to the old capital to promote peaceful unification and democratic nation-building. Unfortunately, he passed away from illness, and the people of the whole country suddenly lost their leader. On his deathbed, he was still deeply concerned about national affairs, instructing us to work together with the nations that treat us equally, to abolish unequal treaties, and to convene a national assembly. Today, President Chiang Kai-shek has inherited Dr. Sun Yat-sen's legacy, eliminating the remaining feudal forces in the country, leading our nation in the War of Resistance against Japan, and achieving victory. He has also abolished unequal treaties and re-signed equal new treaties with countries such as Britain and the United States. Thanks to President Chiang Kai-shek's wise leadership, many of the instructions given to us by Dr. Sun Yat-sen have now been fulfilled one by one. We thank the arrangement of the Almighty God that Dr. Sun Yat-sen's unfinished great cause can have such a wise leader, such as President Chiang Kai-shek, to turn them into reality one by one. Today, on the occasion of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's birthday, we respectfully report this to the spirit of Dr. Sun Yat-sen in heaven.</p>
<p>Today is also an important turning point in our nation's history. The National Assembly, which was postponed several times and decided to be held today, has been postponed again to the 15th. The convening of the National Assembly should have been realized long ago, but it was delayed due to the intensified aggression of the Japanese militarists, which eventually led to the outbreak of the War of Resistance. At that time, our country was fighting bitterly against the enemy, but some people insisted on convening the National Assembly. President Chiang Kai-shek, in order to respect the opinions of all parties, made a promise to convene the National Assembly within one year. It was a established policy for the government to return power to the people and implement constitutional government. Since the Communist Party and some other parties had requested the convening of the National Assembly, it was natural to be happy to accept it under the improved war situation. After Japan surrendered and the government returned to the capital, it was postponed to May of this year. During this period, in order to implement the goal of peaceful unification, the government earnestly negotiated with various parties, repeatedly requesting them to submit the list of members of the National Government and representatives to the National Assembly as scheduled, so that the reorganization of the National Government and the convening of the National Assembly could be held as scheduled. However, it was postponed until April 25th, and the Communist Party still refused to nominate, so it had to be postponed again. The government announced on July 4th that the National Assembly would be postponed to November 12th. The convening of the National Assembly was delayed until today, mainly due to the Communist Party's delay and deliberate obstruction, which is obvious. Recently, the ceasefire orders requested by some parties have also been issued with great forbearance by the government. However, the opening ceremony, which was originally scheduled to be held on Dr. Sun Yat-sen's birthday today, has been postponed again for the last time to the 15th of this month.</p>
<p>What we need today is peaceful unification and democratic construction. The convening of the National Assembly should be a manifestation of peaceful unification and the beginning of democratic construction. In the 13th year of the Republic of China, Dr. Sun Yat-sen went to the old capital at the expense of his health in order to achieve peaceful unification. This spirit of sacrifice and selflessness should move every Chinese person. What we need today is also sacrifice and selflessness. People from all parties and factions, as well as non-party people, should abandon their personal interests to jointly participate in this National Assembly that represents the public opinion of the people. In this way, our country's fundamental law can be passed by the whole people, implemented in the future, embark on the path of constitutional government, and permanently prevent domestic political disputes. The representatives to this National Assembly are legally produced through regional and occupational elections, and are directly selected by the National Government, which can represent the public opinion of the general public. However, what we earnestly hope is that all parties and factions, as well as non-party people, can participate and jointly plan national affairs.</p>
<p>The convening of the National Assembly is for the purpose of formulating a constitution, and after the constitution is formulated, it will be implemented. The Three Principles of the People that Dr. Sun Yat-sen left us is no longer the private property of one party, but the public property of China. Therefore, the formulation of this constitution should be a concrete manifestation of the spirit of the Three Principles of the People. The theory of power and ability and the framework of the Five-Power Constitution should be clearly stipulated in the constitution formulated this time, and those that violate the spirit of the Three Principles of the People should be discarded. In this way, after the constitution is formulated and implemented in the future, the government can fulfill its long-cherished wish to return power to the people and China will embark on the road of democratic politics. And today, we should especially commemorate Dr. Sun Yat-sen by redoubling our efforts to fulfill and promote his legacy.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Wuxi] Xu Yongqing, a native of Changshu, is 29 years old and a graduate of Southwest Associated University. He once worked at the Kunming Central Electrical Equipment Factory. After the victory, he declared himself unemployed. Later, due to repeated offenses, he was wanted by the Kunming authorities. Unable to gain a foothold in Kunming, Xu traveled everywhere, making a living by deceiving people. He has committed dozens of crimes in Taiwan, Shanghai, Suzhou, and other places. On August 3rd of this year, Xu suddenly came to Wuxi and defrauded Wan Yuecheng, the wife of Major General Hu Xianzhi, the commander of the 1st Battalion of the 25th Army Officer Corps, of a large amount of property. Hu serves in Zhengzhou, while Wan is a local resident and currently resides with her mother in Wuxi. His method of fraud is all-pervasive. Sometimes, he tries to detect the secrets of letters sent from afar, and then goes to the destination, using flowery words and eloquent speech, so that the victims invariably believe him. On the afternoon of the 9th, at around 2 PM, Xu was talking with a local youth, Zhang Yan, at the Wanfang Building in Longtouzhu, discussing his plans to go to Taiwan. Unexpectedly, Hu Xianzhi and his wife were also visiting the area and spotted him. They immediately grabbed him. Zhang and Xu know each other, being introduced by his relative, Mi Xueying. Mi has a boyfriend named Yu Yuanzhao, who is currently studying at National Taiwan University. His father is currently the accounting director of the Bank of Taiwan. Recently, Xu also learned the contents of the letters between Yu and Mi, and then went to Mi's house, contacting Xueying. He claimed to be the business director of the Bank of Taiwan and a colleague of Yu's father, inviting Mi to go to Taiwan to work and meet Yu, etc. Mi was unable to leave Wuxi, so she introduced Zhang Yan to go to Taiwan. But the net of heaven is vast, and he was spotted by the Hu couple. He has now been handed over to the police for investigation.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Taixing] The Taixing Provisional Council held its third resident committee meeting on the afternoon of the 7th. The most important motion was that the former county magistrate, Xue Peiqi, had taken the opportunity to falsely report a loss of 25.345 million yuan from the county treasury, as well as embezzling enemy property such as bristles and local wine. Although the council had previously sent a letter to Xue Peiqi requesting a written reply, he had not complied. It was decided to submit the facts of the case and various doubts to the provincial government and the Supervisory Envoy's Office for thorough investigation. It was also decided that the county government should be requested to report the county treasury's income and expenditure and tax collection on a monthly basis for review.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Hefei] The Hefei urban area is vast and densely populated, and environmental sanitation is lacking.

<p>[Our Newspaper, Hefei] Since the financial reform in Anhui Province, expenditures have exceeded income by more than 2 billion yuan. In addition to ordering the tax collection offices of various counties to rectify tax collection to increase revenue, the provincial government has also frequently met to decide on thrift measures: (1) Starting in January of the 36th year [1947], all employees of the field grain offices in various counties will be changed to county-level salaries. (2) All district offices that were restored due to environmental needs in the province a month ago will be abolished starting in January of the 36th year [1947]. All responsibilities for suppressing bandits and maintaining security will be concurrently assumed by the nearby township chiefs. (3) Starting in January of the 31st year [1942], guaranteed salary and public grain will be exempt from payment. Furthermore, because county-level salaries are too low, incumbents cannot make a living, and those who have not been appointed view it as a daunting task, the standing committee also decided to adjust them: (1) Living allowance of 55,000 yuan per month, (2) Salary multiplied by 240.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Fengxian] Xie Hesheng, from Taiping Township in this county, had four mu of good farmland in Wuqiao Township before the Anti-Japanese War. During the occupation, Shen Yutao, relying on the power of the enemy and puppets, forcibly bought it. After the victory, the government announced land consolidation rules, stipulating that land forcibly occupied by enemy and puppet forces during the occupation period could be redeemed according to law, and the person who forcibly occupied it must compensate for all losses during the period of forced occupation. Therefore, Xie's children submitted a petition to the county government, stating the details and voluntarily donating the redeemed farmland to local education funds. County Magistrate Xi investigated and verified the facts, approved Xie's redemption, and then donated the land to help education. After public auction by Township Chief Xie Yunhai and others, a total of sixteen dan of white rice was obtained, which was distributed fairly by County Magistrate Xi. The two elementary schools in Wuqiao and Taiping each received six dan of white rice, and the remainder was distributed by the donors to institutions for the care of needy children. As for the compensation for losses during the period of forced occupation, the original agreement was waived after mediation.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 11th] The provincial government, due to limited funds, only provided 16 million yuan per month for the first three months of administrative maintenance expenses after the recovery of the counties in the recovered areas of northern Jiangsu. However, the actual monthly needs of the counties are currently more than 50 million yuan. It is reported that after the Gao You and Baoying county governments were restored, one month's maintenance expenses were used up in ten days. Xinghua and Dongtai are even more miserable. In the future, in addition to relying on loans, the county governments will have to resort to the old trick of reaching out to the people again. However, the existing property of the people in the recovered areas is only barren land and worthless counterfeit currency, so it is impossible to apportion the burden. Therefore, officials and people in the recovered areas are busy borrowing money every day, and nothing can be done.</p>

<h3 id="e65">Household Relocation Certificate Missing <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>Since the last time there was limited-price sugar to buy, it took so much time and effort to get two catties of Taiwan sugar. (Some people didn't get any.) Now, there's no need to spend effort or time. With a household registration card or national identity card, you can get a sugar ration certificate based on the number of people. This is great news for us, and the sugar purchase certificate was also issued by the Baojia chief a couple of days ago according to the population. However, one thing we don't understand is that we originally lived at No. 180 Henan North Road (Section 16, Bao 9, Jia 23), but moved here last month (No. 55 Dexing Lane, Tanggu Road, Section 16, Bao 32, Jia 10). But because of the move, even the sugar coupons are gone. We went to inquire with the current Jia chief why we didn't have a sugar purchase certificate issued. The Jia chief said, "The higher-ups (referring to the Bao chief) said that only those who moved in before August would get them." So, we went to the old residence Jia chief, who said, "The household registration has been reported, it's not under their management, so naturally there's no sugar purchase certificate." So, where did our family's several sugar purchase coupons go? Who should we get them from? Is it possible that because of the move, even the slightest right to enjoy is revoked? This really baffles us. (Tang Jinyi)</p>
<h3 id="e66">Counting Cash on the Spot at the Bank <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>On the 31st of last month, I was ordered by the manager to go to a certain bank at Jiangxi Road, Jiujiang Road to withdraw 2 million yuan in cash. The teller of the bank paid me four bundles of cash, each bundle being 500,000 yuan. The teller also told me, "This money has been recounted and is accurate." After I received it, I first checked each of the two bundles one by one, and they were indeed correct. At that time, it was past 11:15, and I was limited by the long return journey, and thinking that the two bundles I had counted were very accurate, I thought the rest would be correct too, so I immediately got in the car and returned. In the afternoon, my colleagues and I counted the two bundles of cash that had not been checked, only to find that one bundle was short 5,000 yuan, and the other bundle was short 10,000 yuan. It was already half past three, and it was too late to go and negotiate with the bank. I could only admit my bad luck. Fortunately, the manager understood, otherwise I would have suffered injustice without being able to speak out. According to the bank's practice, each bundle of cash has a paper strip sealed at the top, with the name of the counter and the package number 12119 attached. However, there were actually cases of 3,000 yuan being counted as 10,000 yuan, 5,000 yuan being counted as 10,000 yuan, and 7,000 yuan being counted as 10,000 yuan, causing me to suffer this inexplicable loss. This is a byproduct of the inflation of legal tender. I hope that those who withdraw money will be meticulous in the future. (Cai Heming)</p>

<p>This column published a letter from residents of Bansongyuan Road stating that there were no street lights between Gaochang Temple and Chenjiaqiao. Now we have received a letter from the Public Utilities Bureau stating: "The restoration of street lights in areas such as Hunan is actively being carried out by the Bureau. However, due to the lack of materials needed for the electrical companies to install poles and wires, the work is inevitably affected. We are currently urging them to restore and install them as much as possible within this year. As for the Bansongyuan area, we have sent workers to install 31 street lights." Also, reader Zhou Zanyang wrote a letter stating concerns about street lights. The Public Utilities Bureau replied, "The street light at No. 3148 Fujian North Road has been notified to the Shanghai Electric Power Company for repair. We are now reviewing the attached telephone list for reporting street light repairs, which was established by the Bureau. In the future, if you encounter a broken street light, you can directly report it by phone." A telephone list is enclosed and published here.</p>
<p>According to the opinions expressed by various sectors in this column on the issue of street lights in this city, the Public Utilities Bureau has adopted and improved them, which is already evident.

<h3 id="e68">Results of French General Election Announced, People's Republican Movement Comes in Second, Division of Right-Wing Parties is Reason for Communist Party's Victory <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 11th] Political observers say that the main reason for the Communist Party's victory in yesterday's general election was the division within the right-wing parties. The right-wing was divided into many small parties, so no one party received enough votes to compete with the Communist Party. In the last Constituent Assembly election, the People's Republican Movement was originally stronger than the Communist Party, but it lost a large number of supporters due to the breakaway of the de Gaulle faction, and its strength was weakened. The Socialist Party was divided into left and right wings. The right wing joined the more moderate parties, including the People's Republican Movement; the left wing joined the Left Union. Therefore, the Socialist Party is declining day by day.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 11th] The Ministry of the Interior announced the official figures for the new congressional elections tonight as follows: (1) "Number of Voters" 25,830,000 registered in mainland France, 19,578,000 voters, and 19,216,000 valid votes. (2) "Number of Votes Obtained by Major Parties" Communist Party 5,351,000 votes, People's Republican Movement 4,988,000 votes, Socialist Party 3,433,000 votes, de Gaulle Alliance 585,000 votes, Independent Republican Party 462,000 votes, Left Union 265,000 votes, Peasant Party 200,700 votes. (3) "Distribution of Seats for Mainland and North African Algerian Territories" Communist Party 164 seats, People's Republican Movement 160 seats, Socialist Party 93 seats, Radical Party 42 seats, Right-wing Parties 36 seats, Independent Republican Party 23 seats, de Gaulle Faction 9 seats.</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 11th] In the French parliamentary elections held on Sunday, the Communist Party can now send a prime minister based on the number of votes it received. Qualified observers here today predict that the Communist Party will nominate Thorez for this position, but Thorez will almost certainly be opposed by all other parties.</p>
<h3 id="e69">Communist Party Prepares to Take Responsibility for Forming a Cabinet, But Will Still Adopt a Multiparty System <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 11th] Although the Communist Party won the French general election yesterday, its strength is still dispersed among the major parties. The new cabinet is likely to adopt a multi-party system, similar to the three-party cabinet system since the liberation of France. Communist Party spokesman Pond told reporters last night, "The Communist Party is ready to take responsibility." Political observers believe that this statement is premature, because in a coalition cabinet, it is not easy for the Communist Party to implement its platform. In short, the birth of the new government is still three months away. During this period, the situation will change a lot, especially the Council of State of the second house of Congress will be elected on the 24th of this month, and the situation at that time may be even more subtle.</p>

<p>[United Press, Paris, 10th] This morning, the sky was covered with clouds. The voting situation in Paris for the first parliamentary election of the Fourth French Republic was therefore slow. However, officials from the Ministry of the Interior believe that the number of voters will definitely increase before the end. Cadres of various parties, feeling that the public is indifferent to this election, are using newspapers to vigorously appeal. The People's Republican Movement led by President Bidault is deeply concerned that the lack of voter participation will allow the Communist Party to benefit.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 10th] General elections were held throughout France and its overseas territories today, and the situation was generally good. It was only reported that several election lists in a small town in the northern province of Nord suddenly disappeared, and the police authorities are currently investigating. Interim President and Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Piche was voting in the seventh arrondissement. The President was late until 2 PM, and immediately lined up behind an old woman to vote in order.</p>

The president concluded by saying: I am determined to work with the Republican Congress, and I am confident that my spirit of cooperation and goodwill will be well received by the Republicans.</p>

The doctor certified that it was suicide.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Saigon, 10th] French and Southern Vietnamese people here have expressed their condolences upon hearing the news of the suicide of the President of the Provisional Government of Southern Vietnam, saying that the President had recently been criticized by some Southern Vietnamese people and newspapers, accusing his government of lacking effectiveness. Therefore, this suicide was probably due to his nervous breakdown. The President was a Buddhist, and people here believe that this suicide was a supreme form of protest against all kinds of slander. The French High Commissioner to Vietnam, d'Argenlieu, also went to offer his condolences today.</p>

<p>[United Press, Washington, 10th] Five newly built American cruisers, and six destroyers and submarines each, will join the American fleet in the next five months. The construction of some of these ships will be designed according to wartime experience, including the largest caliber (six to eight inches) automatic guns, firing at a rate almost equal to machine guns. The cruisers are larger than previous battleships of the same class, and some are actually comparable to older battleships. The construction of each ship began at the end of the war. Other battleship styles were more outdated and have been abandoned. These new warships will one day be incorporated with the new ships that have already been launched to form an American fleet in the transitional period between the "present fleet" and the "atomic fleet of tomorrow." At the same time, naval authorities will advance the development of future battleships, starting with the 45,000-ton rocket-launching battleship "Kentucky" and the battlecruiser "Hawaii".</p>

<p>[Our Own Dispatch] Paris, 11th - French government announced today: France intends to suggest to the Four Foreign Ministers Conference that discussions regarding the future of Germany be postponed until January of next year. This request is a result of the victory of the French Communist Party in yesterday's elections.</p>
<p>[United Press, New York, 11th] Diplomatic circles here today speculated that the Communist Party's victory in the French parliamentary elections may alter the balance of power in the Four Foreign Ministers Conference and the United Nations. Whenever contentious issues arise, France does not often side with the United States and Britain, but on major issues, it supports the decisions of the United States and Britain more than those of the Soviet Union. If the balance of power changes in the future, the situation in which the Soviet Union often fails to gain the support of other countries will no longer occur, and it will further prevent Britain and the United States from repeatedly issuing calls for "veto power" against the Soviet Union. US diplomatic circles believe that Soviet foreign policy has recently become more accommodating due to strong opposition. The French election may also affect Soviet foreign policy. Meanwhile, the Four Foreign Ministers have resumed their meetings after resting on Saturday and Sunday. The most important issue currently being drafted for the European peace is the Danube River issue.</p>
<p>[Our Own Dispatch] San Francisco, 11th - Starting this week, US representatives will engage in important side meetings, holding separate negotiations with the other four major powers in order to reach an agreement on the Security Council's veto power issue. It is reported that in response to the movement by various small countries to abolish the veto power, the US representatives have drafted a specific plan, hoping to insert greater flexibility into the voting procedure regulations of the Security Council without changing the principles of the Charter.</p>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 10th] When the Foreign Ministers Conference meets tomorrow, it will consider the proposals for the Romanian peace treaty. The most important of these is the British suggestion to include in the peace treaty clauses regarding foreign oil rights in Romania. The content includes four articles: (1) Romania should restore all oil industry properties belonging to the United Nations; (2) Romania should compensate these oil industries for losses and necessary repairs incurred during the war; (3) The Romanian government should amend its 1942 Petroleum Law, which discriminates against nationals of the United Nations; (4) Romania should allow technical experts to freely enter Romania to work in the oil industries owned by nationals of the United Nations. Among these, the first, second, and fourth articles were not adopted by the Paris Peace Conference, while the third article was passed by a simple majority. The US and the Soviet Union both voted against all four articles, while France opposed the fourth article. When the Foreign Ministers Conference re-discusses this matter tomorrow, there is little hope of it being passed. However, since the Soviet Union has repeatedly raised matters that were not passed by the Paris Peace Conference in this Foreign Ministers Conference, Britain will also continue to propose the four articles regarding Romanian oil rights at the Foreign Ministers Conference.</p>

<p>[Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 11th] As the Japanese local council elections and the elections for the Privy Council (replacing the old House of Peers) approach, various parties are stepping up their activities. The merger of the Liberal and Progressive parties is almost complete, but there are still a few issues that need to be resolved. One of the issues is who will be the leader of the new party. The Liberal Party is hesitant to nominate a leader. Prime Minister Yoshida (President of the Liberal Party) is prepared to reach an understanding with former Prime Minister Shidehara (President of the Progressive Party), but the Liberal Party headquarters is still influenced by former President Hatoyama. Although Hatoyama was purged by MacArthur, his remaining influence still exists, and the relationship between Shidehara and Hatoyama is still not good. On the other hand, there is a lack of unity within the Socialist Party. Its real strength lies in its influence on the working class, and the working masses have now organized labor unions. The Socialist Party has various opportunities to strengthen its own strength in future elections. There is currently no possibility of the Socialist Party and the Communist Party forming a People's Front.</p>

<p>[Remodeling Society, Tokyo, 12th] Prices in Tokyo are soaring daily, and the general salaried class is unable to make ends meet, feeling extremely distressed, leading to repeated labor strikes, which the government is unable to cope with. According to a survey by the Tokyo Police Department's Life Information Division, the black market price of rice is rising by 55 yen and 6 kaku (equivalent to 2 Chinese sheng) per day. The ordinary family ration of rice is only enough for 20 days, and for the remaining 10 days, they rely on black market rice. The monthly income of ordinary civil servants and staff is only 500 to 700 yen, and the income of laborers is 700 to 1000 yen, so they have to replace the white rice they need with coarse grains. An egg costs 6 yen and 5 kaku, a pair of men's leather shoes costs 650 to 700 yen, and a pound of brown sugar costs 1500 yen.</p>

<p>[Our Own Dispatch] Recently, many Dutch people in Bangka Island, Dutch East Indies, who had been detained in Japanese concentration camps, held a meeting and unanimously agreed to express their gratitude to the overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies for their assistance to the Dutch during the period of occupation.

During the period when the Japanese controlled the area, anyone who privately communicated with the Dutch would be subjected to cruel treatment once discovered, which the overseas Chinese were well aware of. However, there were still many overseas Chinese throughout the Dutch East Indies who secretly assisted the Dutch. Clothes and food were still transported to the concentration camps at risk, so the Dutch were deeply grateful. After the victory, the overseas Chinese were very interested in the development of the Dutch East Indies' economy and industry. The overseas Chinese in the Dutch Borneo, Celebes Island, and Bangka Island were particularly active. Recently, the Dutch government convened a meeting in Marina Town, Celebes Island, to discuss political, financial, and economic issues. The overseas Chinese also actively participated.

<h3 id="e99">Xu Xueyu Discusses Maintaining Pier Order: Thoroughly Eradicating Bad Habits and Establishing a New Atmosphere; Urges Maximum Reporting of Extortion and Malpractice <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>The theft of goods and extortion at Shanghai port piers and warehouses has already aroused criticism from Chinese and foreign merchants, as well as the attention of the government's Standing Committee. The newly established Shanghai Port Reorganization Committee has repeatedly discussed this issue, agreed on measures, and is strictly implementing them for rectification. According to Xu Xueyu, General Manager of the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company: since the resumption of operations last year, China Merchants has been determined to rectify the atmosphere and order of the piers and warehouses, and has worked hard to do so. However, due to deeply ingrained habits, the expected results have not yet been achieved. In the future, efforts will continue to thoroughly eradicate decades of bad habits and establish a new atmosphere. Xu also stated: the poor order of Shanghai's piers is due to the past system of dock management monopolized by evil social forces. These evil forces, either through coercion or bribery, would secure a loading and unloading position at a pier and treat it as their personal territory. They would extort merchants and exploit laborers as much as possible, reaping huge profits without laboring. Therefore, they often resorted to various despicable means to compete for territory, even resorting to fighting and bloodshed. After the company moved its office to Shanghai last year, it decided to first abolish the monopoly system and adopt a supervisory system. The aim was to establish a direct relationship between the company and the laborers who actually worked and sweated, ensuring they received all the wages they deserved, preventing contractors from exploiting them, thereby improving the laborers' treatment and increasing their work efficiency and service integrity. Although some progress has been made in the past year, deeply ingrained habits and the laborers' lack of knowledge often led to the supervisory system soon resembling the contractor system again, with various malpractices arising as a result. The company has dismissed and replaced several pier supervisors due to the aforementioned abuses. Employees in charge of each pier who were found to be colluding with supervisors in malpractice were also immediately dismissed, without any leniency. In the future, the company itself will adhere to its original intention and strive to improve as much as possible. At the same time, it is hoped that the Port Reorganization Committee will effectively implement its resolutions, and especially that all sectors of society will provide assistance. If anyone, from responsible personnel to loading and unloading laborers at the company's piers, fails to comply with the company's regulations and engages in arbitrary extortion or embezzlement, please provide responsible reports with solid evidence to the company. The company is determined to deal with them severely and will be responsible for protecting the rights and interests of the informants. Cooperation from all relevant parties is essential to achieve results and prevent these evil forces from using their skills, ultimately leading to their demise. Furthermore, regarding the practice of "tip money," its origin was actually due to merchants voluntarily adding extra money to the stipulated wages in order to expedite the delivery of goods, which later became a customary practice. Therefore, the company sincerely hopes that merchants will pay according to the company's regulations in the future and avoid creating bad precedents by seeking temporary convenience.</p>

<p>Regarding the registration of land rights and land value tax for British overseas Chinese in Shanghai, Mayor Wu and Director Zhu have repeatedly consulted with the British Consul, and have agreed on principles and various details based on Chinese laws and the actual situation of British overseas Chinese. At 10 AM yesterday, British Consul John Reeves visited Director Zhu of the Land Administration Bureau again to discuss the implementation procedures. The result was quite satisfactory, and ten measures were established, which are excerpted below:</p>
<p>(1) If the registered owner of the land is a British person, but the actual rights belong to a Chinese person, the Chinese owner who holds a "daoqi" (official deed) or a "quanbingdan" (title deed) should directly apply for registration with the Land Administration Bureau. The Land Administration Bureau should promptly list the name of the British registered owner, the name of the Chinese beneficial owner, and the number of the canceled "daoqi" and notify the British Consulate. (2) "Daoqi" or "quanbingdan" issued by Japanese or puppet organizations cannot be used as proof of property rights. (3) The procedure for British overseas Chinese property owners to apply for land registration is as follows: First, the British overseas Chinese property owner should submit the "daoqi" to the British Consulate and fill out a sworn statement, declaring that they are the true owner. After the consulate authorities approve it, they will provide a certificate. Second, the British overseas Chinese property owner should submit the aforementioned certificate, along with the "daoqi," to the Land Administration Bureau to apply for a land ownership certificate. Third, British overseas Chinese who hold other deeds such as "fangdan" (square deed), "tiandan" (field deed), "quanbingdan," and receipts for registration applied for before the war, should submit them to the British Consulate and fill out a sworn statement, declaring that they are the true owner. After the consulate authorities approve it, they will provide a certificate, and the owner will submit the aforementioned deeds and certificate to the Land Administration Bureau. After verification, the Land Administration Bureau will issue a land ownership certificate. (4) The Land Administration Bureau will not charge any fees for British overseas Chinese property owners to apply for registration and exchange land ownership certificates.

<p>[Another report] The implementation measures for the land registration of American overseas Chinese have already been agreed upon. Regarding the regulations on the permission of land ownership for the Chinese people by the United States, the provisions of each state are different. The articles of the regulations of each state reported a few days ago were adopted by the Land Administration Bureau from the book "Aliens and the Law" published by the North Carolina State University in the United States. The book was written by Gibson and is not the official document provided by the U.S. Embassy or Consulate. Therefore, the Land Administration Bureau is now requesting the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to obtain this information.</p>

<h3 id="e109">Wu Weijing Discusses the Textile Industry in the Northeast After Returning from Inspection: There Are a Total of 550,000 Spindles; The Textile Construction Company Only Accepted One-Tenth <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Wu Weijing, Deputy General Manager of the China Textile Construction Corporation, flew to Peiping in mid-October to inspect the textile industry in the northeastern provinces and investigate the cotton planting situation along the Longhai and Pinghan lines. He spent four weeks in total and returned to the city last Saturday. In an interview with reporters, he stated that he had inspected each of the four areas of Peiping, Tianjin, the Northeast, and the Longhai-Pinghan lines for about a week. The main purpose of the trip to the Northeast was to inspect the textile industry, raw material supply, cloth distribution, and the resumption of work of the factories taken over by the Textile Construction Company. The trip along the Longhai and Pinghan lines was to investigate the production and purchase volume of raw cotton.</p>
<p>Nineteen Cotton Mills Destroyed</p>
<p>When Wu spoke about the textile industry in the Northeast, he first mentioned the cotton spinning industry. Before the September 18th Incident, there was only one cotton mill operated by Chinese, the Fengtian Yarn Factory. Later, the Yingkou Yarn Factory was also established. However, both were successively purchased and merged by the Japanese. Up to now, there are eleven large and small cotton mills in the northeastern provinces, distributed in Shenyang (four), near Dalian (three), Liaoyang, Yingkou, Jinzhou, Andong, and other places (one each), with a total of 550,000 spindles. The four factories in Shenyang have a total of 160,000 spindles. The equipment in one factory has been completely removed by the Soviet army. The equipment in the other three factories was first removed by the Soviet army, then looted by local ruffians, and finally destroyed by fire. Only a few looms remain. These four factories are currently being reorganized by the Dongbei Production Administration. The three factories in Dalian have a total of 220,000 spindles. The damage is not serious, and it is actually the essence of the textile industry in the Northeast. However, they are still under the control of the Soviet army. The factories taken over by the Textile Construction Company are in Liaoyang, Yingkou, Jinzhou, and Andong. The factories in Liaoyang and Yingkou have been visited twice by both the Soviet army and the Communist Eighth Route Army, resulting in the removal of materials and important parts. The factory in Liaoyang has 78,000 spindles and 1,045 looms. Two spindles have now been put into operation. The factory in Yingkou has 55,000 spindles and 1,500 looms. 20,000 spindles have now been put into operation. The factory in Jinzhou has 51,000 spindles and 1,200 looms, and has complete printing and dyeing equipment. The machinery in this factory is the Toyota type from 1938, which is very new. 15,000 spindles have now been put into operation. The factory in Andong has 16,000 spindles. Since Andong has just been recovered, it is reported that the Communist army has not yet destroyed the factory. The Textile Construction Company has sent people to take over, but the details have not yet been reported. Therefore, in total, the eleven factories in the northeastern provinces have a total of 550,000 spindles, and the number of spindles that can be definitively determined to be in operation is probably the 55,000 spindles in the factories taken over by the Textile Construction Company.</p>
<p>Cotton Production Sufficient for Self-Sufficiency</p>
<p>Next, Wu spoke about the cotton planting situation in the Northeast. The Japanese developed agriculture with the spirit of developing industry, which is worth discussing. Before the September 18th Incident, cotton was not planted in the Northeast. However, after the Japanese forcibly occupied the Northeast, they actively planned to plant cotton. By the time Japan surrendered last year, they were able to produce 800,000 piculs annually, which was enough to supply 60% of the raw materials for the 550,000 spindles in the Northeast. The Japanese planned to increase production to 1.5 million piculs within three years, so that the Northeast could be self-sufficient in raw cotton. The Japanese promoted cotton planting through both economic and political means. A total of 18 large-scale cotton ginning factories were established in the cotton-producing areas of the Northeast. The Japanese calculated in advance the area of land to be planted and the amount of raw cotton that should be produced per mu (unit of area). All the seed cotton produced was handed over to the ginning factories for purchase. After the seed cotton was ginned, the good seeds were kept for planting the following year, and the inferior seeds were used for oil extraction. Therefore, there were only two types of cotton produced. One was the Guannong No. 1 American cotton variety, which accounted for 90% of the production. The other was the Liaoyang No. 1 cotton, which accounted for 10% of the production. The former had shorter cotton fibers and therefore matured earlier. The annual yield was also high, and the yield of seed cotton was also high, so it was widely planted and propagated. However, the Japanese were very harsh on those who failed to achieve the expected goals in cotton planting. They often took the old cotton from the clothes of cotton farmers to replace it. Finally, the Japanese invented man-made fibers made from wood pulp to replace raw cotton. The factory in Andong can now produce 100,000 tons of man-made fibers per day. However, the cost of this substitute is too high and it is not as durable as raw cotton.</p>
<p>Annual Production of 130,000 Tons of Hemp</p>
<p>The hemp weaving industry in the Northeast is second only to the cotton spinning industry in importance. There are currently five Soviet hemp weaving factories. They are distributed as follows: one factory in Liaoyang, which is now being taken over by the Production Administration. The loss to the factory was not great. Two factories in Shenyang, which are being taken over by the Ministry of Military Affairs. One factory in Changchun, the situation is unknown. The military hemp bags in the Northeast during the war were all supplied by these five factories. In terms of raw materials, there are green hemp and flax, etc. The Japanese forced the planting of hemp, so the annual hemp production in the Northeast reached 130,000 tons. There are four woolen mills in total. Most of the machines in the two factories in Shenyang have been removed by the Soviet army. One factory in Jinzhou, which is now being taken over by the Ministry of Military Affairs. The situation of the two factories in Harbin is unknown. The four factories have a total of 16,000-17,000 woolen spindles. There are a total of 3.7 million wool sheep in the Northeast, which can produce 70,000 tons of wool annually.</p>
<p>The tussah silk industry is the most developed in Andong, and can produce about 100,000 cocoons annually.</p>
<p>Clothing Problem is the Most Serious</p>
<p>According to Wu's observations, among the three major problems of food, clothing, and housing in the Northeast, the clothing problem is currently the most serious. In the past, because the Japanese controlled cotton cloth too strictly, almost all cotton cloth was supplied to the military. Therefore, the current price of cloth in the Northeast is 10-20% higher than in Guannei (areas south of the Great Wall). The Textile Construction Company is now accelerating the start-up rate of all the factories it has taken over in order to increase the production of yarn and cloth. At the same time, it is launching a campaign to transport yarn and cloth from the south to the north to alleviate the urgent need. In order to promote the cotton planting movement, those who sell cotton to the Textile Construction Company will be given preferential prices for yarn and cloth in exchange for the purchase of more cotton.</p>
<p>National Raw Cotton Production</p>
<p>Again, Wu spoke about the production, transportation, and purchase situation of raw cotton in the country. Wu said that according to preliminary estimates, the production of raw cotton in the country this year can reach 6.2 million piculs. Because the climate along the Longhai and Pinghan lines is good, production can increase to 7 million piculs. According to the investigation, the Northeast produced about 350,000 piculs this season. Xi'an produced 650,000 piculs. Henan produced 600,000 piculs. Hebei produced 1.8 million piculs.</p>
<p>In terms of cotton quality, Shaanxi is the best. More than half of the cotton produced in that area can be used to spin 42-count yarn. The cotton produced in Henan can be used to spin 32-count yarn. The cotton produced in the Northeast and Tianjin can be used to spin 20-count yarn. The cotton produced in Hebei is of the worst quality and can only be used to spin 12-count yarn. There is a situation of adulteration of cotton in various places. Wu sincerely hopes that the government authorities will find ways to inspect and crack down on it. Otherwise, the quality of raw cotton will inevitably decline day by day.</p>
<h3 id="e110">Difficulties in Purchasing Cotton <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the quantity of cotton purchased, Wu believes that it is not optimistic. The reasons are: (1) Transportation difficulties, traffic obstruction on the Longhai Railway. (2) Tight credit, difficulty in remittance. (3) Lack of packaging equipment. (4) The consumption of cotton by cotton farmers themselves is also considerable. Of the 7 million piculs of cotton, cotton farmers consume at least 4 million piculs themselves. The remaining one million piculs will be shelved due to inconvenient transportation. Only about 2 million piculs can be transported to various factories for use.</p>
<p>Wu concluded by saying that in order to solve the various problems of the textile industry in our country, the first thing is to stop the national military conflict as soon as possible. If peace is achieved, the cotton production in our country will definitely be self-sufficient within three years. This measure will not only be enough to revitalize the rural economy, but also to prosper our country's textile industry.</p>
<h3 id="e111">Overview of the Hongying Library; Rich Collection of Historical Materials Since the Founding of the Republic of China; Depleted Funds Affect Expansion Plans <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>[Special Report by this Newspaper] At the intersection of Linsen Road and Fuxing West Road, there is a small two-story western-style house with a pointed roof and red walls. The iron gate of the surrounding wall is half-open and half-closed. If it were not for a long black copper sign hanging next to the door, probably no one would have thought that this place houses the "Hongying Library" with more than 150,000 volumes of books and magazines. For this library, I believe that most citizens may never have noticed its existence, the biggest reason probably being due to the relatively remote address. However, tracing back its history, it has been more than fifteen years. The current managing director, Huang Yanpei, who was also the original initiator, organized the Jiazi Society with Shen Xinqing, Yuan Guanlan, and others in 1924. The work was to select and compile descriptions of human culture, named "Humanities Series." In 1929, Qian Xinzhi and Xu Jingren raised funds to compile periodical indexes, humanities monthly magazines, and related series in addition to historical materials, and prepared for a library. In 1931, the "Jiazi Society" was officially renamed the "Humanities Society." It was not until 1932 that Mr. Ye Hongying donated 500,000 yuan. 100,000 yuan was allocated to run a village primary school, and the remaining 400,000 yuan was used as the library fund. The current address on Linsen Road was rented as the library building, which was the beginning of the establishment of the "Hongying Library."</p>
<p>Rich Collection of Historical Materials</p>
<p>Among the collection of more than 150,000 volumes, there are more than 50,000 books and more than 100,000 magazines. In addition, there are 49 kinds of newspapers. The nature of the books is more biased towards academics, especially Chinese and foreign history and geography, and local magazines are the most complete. Magazines and newspapers are collected completely, from the late Qing Dynasty to around 1924, they are mostly complete. But the most valuable thing is the rich collection of historical materials. From the founding of the Republic of China to 1940, all kinds of historical materials from various newspapers have been selected, clipped, edited, reviewed, and classified and bound, with a total of more than 3,000 volumes and more than 1.76 million pieces.</p>
<p>Relatively Few New Books</p>
<p>The relatively small number of new books and the lack of materials in recent years can explain the suffering of cultural undertakings since the War of Resistance. During the occupation, the enemy also visited, but fortunately they only confiscated more than 1,000 books that were said to contain anti-Japanese ideas, and the rest were preserved. However, due to rising prices, currency depreciation, and the gradual depletion of funds, coupled with the harsh environment, work inevitably stagnated. Although Huang raised nearly 20 million yuan from various parties after the victory, it was only enough to maintain the status quo under the soaring prices.</p>
<p>Number of Readers Per Day</p>
<p>Currently, the average number of people visiting the library every day is only about 40, mostly students from various universities looking for information. Each person is charged a reading fee of 100 yuan. The opening hours are from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and from 1:30 PM to 5:00 PM. Although the address is a bit remote, the environment is very quiet.</p>
<p>The "Humanities Society" is constantly seeking to promote its cause. They have always hoped to build a larger library building, expand the equipment for books and magazines, and actively continue to engage in the publication of historical materials indexes, in order to make a greater contribution to society. However, all of this requires funding. They have already started a fundraising campaign with a preliminary goal of 200 million yuan, hoping that the wealthy people of Shanghai can enthusiastically support this cultural undertaking that has already reached a considerable scale.</p>

<p>按綢像乃已故浙江醫專校長李滇　長公子李振民所發明。李氏聰敏多才於二十歲時，在浙大竺可楨校長鼓勵指導之下，即發明「度量衡計算尺」及「可變萬碼銷」兩種設計，並均呈准專利，李氏自幼即對攝影有極大興趣，數年前開始硏究綢像，乃父以月薪半數供其實騐仿製，起初成續不佳，後雖用荷蘭布試騐，但藥膜總難塗勻，後改用國產紡綢，以滾筒替代刷　，始於二十八年試騐成功，但李氏仍嫌不滿，再經多年硏究改良，始吿圓滿。</p>
<p>It is said that the silk image was invented by Li Zhenmin, the eldest son of the late Li Dian, the president of Zhejiang Medical College. At the age of twenty, under the encouragement and guidance of President Zhu Kezhen of Zhejiang University, Li invented the "Measurement Calculation Ruler" and the "Variable Ten Thousand Code Lock," both of which were patented. Li had a great interest in photography from an early age and began to study silk images several years ago. His father provided half of his monthly salary for him to experiment and imitate. At first, the results were not good. Later, although Dutch cloth was used for testing, it was always difficult to apply the chemical film evenly. Later, domestic spun silk was used instead, and a roller was used instead of a brush. The experiment was successful in the twenty-eighth year [of the Republic], but Li was still dissatisfied and continued to research and improve it for many years before it was completed.</p>
<p>製造綢像過程乃以最好之白紡綢，剔去斷絲和起毛部份，在暗房中塗上膠質滷素和銀化物等，亁燥後即可作晒紙應用。然後以一感光正當照片，附着於晒像紡綢之上，在日光下曝露約兩分鐘，綢面即現正影，再經顯影定影手續後即吿完成。最普通色彩爲淡黃，咖啡和藍色。現李氏經友好鼓勵，決定正式設立中國綢像廠製造，以資發揚國產。</p>
<p>The process of making silk images is to use the best white spun silk, remove the broken silk and fluff, and apply gelatinous halogen and silver compounds in a darkroom. After drying, it can be used as photographic paper. Then, a light-sensitive photograph is attached to the silk for exposure, and the silk surface shows a positive image after about two minutes of exposure to sunlight. After developing and fixing, it is completed. The most common colors are light yellow, coffee, and blue. Now, with the encouragement of friends, Li has decided to formally establish the China Silk Image Factory for manufacturing to promote domestic products.</p>

<p>冒充上海啤酒　印刷所主告發</p>
<p>Imitating Shanghai Beer; Printing House Owner Reports</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市天平路三十號鴻茂蔬菜舖，兼售啤酒，因品質不佳，銷數甚少，店主閻振德遂思將該項啤酒冒充「UB」商標之上海啤酒，委託江蘇路二八〇號合衆印刷所張志儉仿印「UB」商標紙一萬張，付定洋十萬元，張受託後又向牛莊路七二七號藝　製版公司製造　版四塊，及新閘路二二九號　星印刷所刻製滿圓形木版二塊，各版備妥後，張又轉託聯文美術印刷所鉛印部職負孫瑞鶴代印，事機不密，被所主虞榮發覺，經其報吿上海啤酒廠，由廠方轉報江寗路警分局，將該案破獲，並抄得已製就之僞商標五千張，於一昨日下午由江寗分局將此案解送一地檢處法辦。</p>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Hongmao Vegetable Shop, No. 30 Tianping Road, in this city, also sells beer. Due to poor quality, sales were very low. The shop owner, Yan Zhende, thought of imitating Shanghai Beer with the "UB" trademark for the beer. He commissioned Zhang Zhijian of Hezhong Printing House, No. 280 Jiangsu Road, to imitate and print 10,000 sheets of "UB" trademark paper, paying a deposit of 100,000 yuan. After accepting the commission, Zhang also asked Yi [unclear character] Plate Making Company, No. 727 Niuzhuang Road, to make four plates, and Xing Printing House, No. 229 Xinzha Road, to carve two full circular wooden plates. After the plates were prepared, Zhang then entrusted Sun Ruihe, who was responsible for the letterpress department of Lianwen Art Printing House, to print them on his behalf. The matter was not kept secret and was discovered by the owner of the printing house, Yu Rong. After he reported it to the Shanghai Beer Factory, the factory reported it to the Jiangning Road Police Sub-bureau, which cracked the case and seized 5,000 forged trademarks that had been made. Yesterday afternoon, the Jiangning Sub-bureau transferred the case to the District Prosecutor's Office for handling.</p>

<p>（一）手生贅肉</p>
<p>(1) Excess Flesh on Hands</p>
<p>黃維明問我是一個男性靑年，身體素健，但近來雙手有小肉生出，不痛不腫，俗稱曰「豬頭肉」我曾用碱與石灰剪破後敷之，尙有效騐，然愈後不久，即又生長於他處，且剪後疤痕不退，誠屬隱憂，不知應如何治療？</p>
<p>Huang Weiming asks: I am a young man in good health, but recently, small pieces of flesh have grown on my hands, without pain or swelling, commonly known as "pig's head meat." I have tried cutting them off with alkali and lime and applying it to them, which has been effective, but soon after healing, they grow again elsewhere, and the scars after cutting do not fade, which is a real concern. I don't know how to treat it.</p>
<p>〔張仲明醫師答〕手上之肉疣，宜用手術或電燙根除，若用硝酸銀等腐蝕劑，亦可見效</p>
<p>[Dr. Zhang Zhongming replies] For warts on the hands, surgery or electrocautery should be used to remove them. Corrosives such as silver nitrate can also be effective.</p>
<p>（二）麻瘋惡症</p>
<p>(2) Leprosy</p>
<p>陸慶祥問　我有一個朋友，不幸患了麻瘋病，現在手指已爛去一節，雖然他有强他的身體，但前途是非常可怕的，曾來滬在「中國痳瘋病院」醫過一次，但他家裏很窮。未能將其治愈，現在我有幾個問題請求解答：（一）中國痳瘋病院在何處？現仍有貧民免費診療否？（二）此病能否治瘉？</p>
<p>Lu Qingxiang asks: I have a friend who unfortunately has leprosy. Now, one section of his finger has rotted away. Although he is trying to strengthen his body, the future is very scary. He came to Shanghai to be treated at the "China Leprosy Hospital" once, but his family is very poor and unable to cure him. Now, I have several questions to ask: (1) Where is the China Leprosy Hospital located? Does it still offer free treatment for the poor? (2) Can this disease be cured?</p>
<p>〔張仲明醫師答〕白利南路有一麻瘋醫院，貧民可以免費診療，此症一經發出，就不易治愈，且極易傳染，故患者經醫師證實後，須與常人完全隔離。</p>
<p>[Dr. Zhang Zhongming replies] There is a leprosy hospital on Bailinan Road where the poor can receive free treatment. Once this disease occurs, it is difficult to cure and is very contagious. Therefore, after the patient is diagnosed by a doctor, they must be completely isolated from ordinary people.</p>

<p>Anecdotes of the Youth of the Founding Father of the Nation, Mr. Sun Yat-sen   Lu Danlin</p>
<p>The life of the Founding Father was dedicated to revolution for over forty years, all for the sake of China's freedom and equality, and for the completion of the construction of a nation based on the Three Principles of the People. Such lofty and great character and the spirit of courageous advancement should not be limited to commemorative days but should be constantly remembered and practiced diligently.</p>
<p>An extraordinary person also has anecdotes that distinguish him from ordinary people in his childhood. Now, taking advantage of the anniversary of his birth, I will discuss anecdotes from the childhood of the Founding Father.</p>
<p>From his early years, the Founding Father possessed revolutionary ideas, as if revolution was innate. He never proactively bullied others, but if someone unreasonably insulted him, he would immediately resist. He also had a sense of justice and was not afraid of fighting. One day, the Founding Father was walking in a garden on his way home from school when he suddenly saw dozens of Qing soldiers and yamen runners, armed with weapons, surrounding the house of the garden owner. They dragged out the garden owner and his two brothers, put them in shackles, and escorted them away. One of them was subjected to torture, while the others were imprisoned, and their property was confiscated. The villagers, fearing the tyrannical officials, dared to be angry but not speak out. The Founding Father was extremely indignant and mustered the courage to ask the village chief. The village chief became angry, threatened him with a knife, and forbade him from speaking out. The Founding Father realized that civil rights were not promoted and corrupt officials were rampant, and his resistance to despotic power had already been brewing since his childhood.</p>
<p>On another occasion, the residence of a wealthy merchant in the village was suddenly robbed by pirates. The villagers fled in panic. Upon hearing this, the Founding Father calmly went to the robbed household to investigate. It happened to be when the bandits were searching for belongings. He looked at the fierce faces of the robbers, expressing his disdain. On the one hand, he secretly cursed the local officials for failing to protect public safety and that the locality did not organize itself for self-defense, resulting in rampant bandits, as if the area was deserted.</p>
<p>Seeing the pain of his elder sister's bound feet, the Founding Father advised his mother not to follow the custom and inflict such suffering on her. Unable to overcome the backward customs of society, which could not be changed within the family for a time, the Founding Father was stimulated by this and became even more determined to work hard to transform society.</p>
<p>Da Cheng Gong was a farmer who lived a simple and frugal life. When the Founding Father studied at night, he only lit a lamp if there was no moonlight; if there was moonlight, he would read under the moonlight. When he did use a lamp, he only used one wick, otherwise, his mother would scold him for being wasteful. In such an environment, he diligently recited and reviewed his lessons. He entered a private school at the age of seven. The teacher taught him the "Three Character Classic." Although he could recite it fluently, he did not understand the meaning of the book. When he asked the teacher, the teacher could not explain it clearly, preventing this intelligent young student from gaining understanding.</p>
<p>He would ask his mother how the blue sky was created, what was the meaning of calling the emperor "Long Live," and what happened when people died. His mother could not answer these questions. Later, he realized that death meant the end of everything, so he said, "After I die in the future, I will not let my life end like this." Indeed, his prediction came true more than fifty years later.</p>
<p>Decades ago, people were deeply superstitious about idols. The hand of the idol in the North Emperor Temple in Cuiheng Village was destroyed by the Founding Father and Lu Haodong, which aroused the anger of the villagers. However, the Founding Father knew that those lifeless idols made of wood and stone could not bring blessings or dispel disasters. By destroying them, he expressed his resistance to superstition, letting the villagers know that man-made objects of clay and wood were merely puppets and had nothing to do with people's fortunes.</p>
<p>The various anecdotes from the Founding Father's childhood all reveal his resistance to tyranny, his struggle for human rights, his pursuit of freedom, his breaking of superstitions, and his search for truth. "Seeing the small, one knows the great," and "from the small, one can see the large." The revolutionary endeavors of the following forty years, the expulsion of the Manchus, the overthrow of the Qing Dynasty, the constitutional protection movement, and the wars, all began to take shape in his youth.</p>
<p>Sand Grain   Jiang Dun</p>
<p>Silence! Like a silent, solid grain of sand.</p>
<p>A tiny grain of sand, without the brilliance of a gem or the preciousness of gold, seems to have been forgotten by us. However, countless tiny grains of sand silently gather to form beaches, hills, and pave our roads...</p>
<p>We carelessly walk over it, but it kisses our burning feet. Some people who walk with firm steps may have their feet pierced by the sand, leaving a trace of blood, telling them this is the road they have walked!</p>
<p>Sand grains tell us that only stronger and more solid life can be everywhere and can last forever!</p>
<p>Remnants   Gang Wu</p>
<p>It's a pity to throw away what's left after eating.</p>
<p>Xiao Sizi ate a sesame seed cake, and the sesame seeds fell into the cracks of the table. He slapped them down. It doesn't matter if his palm hurts, the materials weren't wasted.</p>
<p>Locals set up banquets, and the pork knuckles and whole ducks are frozen and untouched. Afterwards, they are brought back intact. Even chicken heads and fish tails can be distributed to the students and children to "fill their heads."</p>
<p>But there are many leftover materials, but too little leftover salary!</p>
<p>However, in some corners, there are still many leftover commoners who have never seen leftover materials in their lives. After two months, one could say, "There are those who have not seen it for thirty-six years." We can reuse our leftover energy to engage in several more leftover internal conflicts. Anyway, we are a first-class power, and Heaven will bless us with "post-war" relief!</p>
<p>Public utilities will surely develop greatly. The worry of "no car to go out" is already a leftover concern. Leftover rickshaws will naturally be eliminated. The leftover roads are for jeeps and tigers to gallop on. Citizens cannot squeeze onto public transport, so they can use their leftover leg strength to spend their leftover time.</p>
<p>The appointment of traitors should be limited, so that many leftover traitors can be preserved. A great nation can accommodate them. Wouldn't it be a pity if they became extinct? People are inherently hypocritical, so why take it seriously?</p>
<p>Various countries are researching the atom, and Japan is also requesting to keep it. Okay! Let's make it public and drop a few bombs on them, giving the remaining people groaning in suffering a safe "resting place"!</p>
<p>San'er   Lu Yang</p>
<p>—Memories of First Love</p>
<p>San'er was the childhood name of a female classmate of mine from junior high school. I don't know how everyone found out. For a slightly more attractive member of the opposite sex, boys are sometimes as greedy as hounds. Sometimes, in the dormitories after evening self-study, some older classmates would say some incomprehensible and lewd things. At that time, I was young, just a teenager. But unconsciously, San'er seemed to have crawled into my life, and San'er even seemed to belong to something of mine, but I couldn't explain what it was.</p>
<p>The first time I saw San'er was in the auditorium during a weekly assembly. She was sitting in the back row on the right. A friend from the same dormitory pointed her out to me. When I turned my head to search for her with my eyes, my face inexplicably flushed. But I finally recognized her. The pair of yellow velvet flowers on her black braids confused me first. Her face was not as white and tender as I imagined, but slightly dark. Her big eyes were hazy, like a strange sea shrouded in light mist. Most of her body was leaning against the backrest, and her chest rose and fell like waves, revealing a slender, curved beauty. I couldn't help but whisper: A lithe girl like a snake!</p>
<p>That night, I dreamed that the hair ornaments turned into a pair of yellow butterflies, fluttering in front of my eyes.</p>
<p>Not long after, she happened to join the same wall newspaper group as me. My writing ability and demeanor seemed to gradually attract her attention. A boy's strengths also make girls care, right? I thought, and gained more courage.</p>
<p>I felt that I was in love with her, although I didn't know what love was. I only knew that my spirit could not leave her for a moment. If she wasn't in my life, then everything would become meaningless. And she should only be loved by me, she cannot love others, and others cannot love her.</p>
<p>Hot blood burned in my heart. Every accidental meeting made my heart beat faster and my face flushed. I should pour out this infinite tide of emotions to her! Talk? No way.</p>
<p>Finally, one day, I made an excuse to ask her to read a manuscript, secretly slipping a long letter inside. When I came back, I fell headfirst on the bed, not eating or drinking, as if I had malaria, excited and nervous for a while, and thinking that I was "cooled down" for another.</p>
<p>The next day, when I walked into the classroom with a pale face after a sleepless night, I was surprised not to see her. After calming down, I found her sick leave slip posted on the wall.</p>
<p>For three days, four days, I didn't receive a single word of reply. I really got sick, sick for no reason. I just had a high fever and mouth sores. I was sent to the hospital.</p>
<p>The morning light of Easter, warm and bright, shone on a corner of the hospital bed. A collective chorus of white-clothed angels came from outside the window. It was bright and musical. What a good day!</p>
<p>My health gradually recovered. My mood after despair turned calm. Bathed in the golden sunlight, I happily and lazily dreamed golden dreams. I remembered my hometown, my mother, and the enemy's cruel rule. I also looked forward to my own future, which should be a magnificent and great scene.</p>
<p>"Lu Yang!" I couldn't believe I suddenly heard such a clear and delicate voice in my ears. I opened my eyes as if in a dream. Heavens! Standing at the head of the bed was a face of warmth, shyness, guilt, and a smile, holding two strangely shining crystal gems; it was a pair of fluttering yellow butterflies; it was...</p>
<p>"Ah, it's you?" I seemed to fall from one world into another, unconsciously filling with tears.</p>
<p>I was discharged from the hospital that afternoon.</p>
<p>After that, at school, because of the constraints of the environment, we couldn't have a pleasant and unrestrained conversation. We only shot affectionate and caring glances at each other when we met, occasionally sending a few letters to express our feelings. But no matter what, my heart was full and overflowing with joy, and my feet tapped out the rhythm of a youthful love song.</p>
<p>And don't forget: This was during the war, and it was an occupied area. This summer, our school was closed by the enemy.</p>
<p>What a short period of milky white time!</p>
<p>The night before the parting, I secretly asked her to talk in the auditorium. She arrived on time, but she brought a bodyguard, also a female classmate in the class. I felt quite embarrassed, and I didn't know how to say it. Apart from exchanging plans for the future, there wasn't a deep sentence. The only thing that jumped in my memory was her shy bow, when I glanced at her sideways in the moonlight.</p>
<p>When I returned, I hated and blamed myself for being useless, but I couldn't help but wonder: Why don't girls want their boyfriends to reveal secrets in love, but they often set up think tanks themselves?</p>
<p>Late at night, I wrote a five-page lingering and determined farewell letter.</p>
<p>Goodbye, my love. When I hired a rickshaw to go out of the street, I found her pair of starry, shining eyes, piercing through the morning mist, calling to me "Goodbye." From then on, what accompanied me were poverty, exile, and endless battles. Love will write an immortal epic. From then on, the gap between the free zone and the occupied zone cut off each other's news.</p>
<p>Not long after the victory, I sent her a letter woven with old feelings. Almost a year passed, but there was no reply. In the summer, I happened to meet an old classmate from my hometown, who happened to be the one who first pointed me out to recognize "San'er." He said that he had heard San'er say that she was no longer interested in those things from her youth.</p>
<p>For many days, I pondered this matter. This wasn't love, this was a comedy of youth; no! This was the overflow of emotion when childishness hadn't yet faded.</p>
<p>Let the past bury the old dreams, I should pursue the spring light before me.</p>
<p>Ripe Year   Cai Lin</p>
<p>Rice fears ripening. This autumn, the rice ripened so severely that I watched it almost dry to death. The fields also cracked. The farmers pumped water day and night, finally turning the danger into safety. This year, we have 1.2 harvests per mu. It's a ripe year for rice.</p>
<p>When the cotton was only as long as chopsticks, the heavens didn't help. A strong wind and heavy rain drowned the cotton. The villagers cried and wailed, thinking that this year would be hard to get through. Unexpectedly, the cotton that was submerged in water gradually recovered after the flood receded, and it was a complete harvest. I didn't expect cotton to have a ripe year too.</p>
<p>The hairy crabs in Yangcheng Lake have an especially high yield this year. The "gutless gentlemen" on the crab stalls are busier than the bedbugs in Shanghai's back alleys. Moreover, each one is big and fat. As a result, Shanghai is flooded with lake crabs. For at most 10,000 yuan, you can buy six. This year is also a ripe year for hairy crabs.</p>
<p>Everywhere you turn, you see unemployed people with worried looks. Perhaps unemployed friends also have a ripe year.</p>
<p>Cases of corruption are often heard, and cases of fraud are even more frequent. Can this be considered a ripe year?</p>
<p>Poetry and Reality   Luo Binjia</p>
<p>If a poet can grasp the present every day, and only deal with what is presented before their eyes with a fresh mind, then they will definitely be able to create good or even excellent works, no matter when or where. Even if they occasionally fail, there will be no loss. (Quoted from "Conversations with Goethe")</p>
<p>Coolie   Luo Gannian</p>
<p>Every Inch of Mountain, Every Inch of River, Every Drop of Blood   96   Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>"Little aunt, I've counted them. Going down the line to the north, there are twenty-nine of these things." "These things" of course refers to the gun emplacements.</p>
<p>"Why do the gun mounts need Sichuan coal blocks for installation?" I asked myself. I thought the devil's plan was probably a two-pronged approach: On one hand, coal blocks could be used to hide the gun emplacements, and on the other hand, coal could be stored as much as possible. Perhaps only the surface layer is coal, and below are concrete gun emplacements and underground ammunition depots! From this, we can also see that the Japanese are meticulous in their crude planning, and the meticulousness contains infinite stupidity. However, setting up such an arrangement in this remote and desolate place is indeed a bit scary. It also shows that the Japanese are extremely unscrupulous in their ambition to harm us.</p>
<p>On top of the coal pile, we could also see the light of the automatic searchlight drawing circles. However, the angle was not high, and the light was not strong, so it couldn't reach here at all.</p>
<p>According to my calculations, time was very tight, and there was no time to carefully study the construction and layout of these gun emplacements. I told Tiger Brother to quickly return to the east side of the coal pile to deal with the gasoline. Just as Tiger Brother was about to move, I grabbed him again and pointed to the westernmost edge, asking what the situation was like and whether he could see it. Tiger Brother said that he had seen it from the top of the coal pile, and the layout was the same as the east side. Outside the stream, there seemed to be a road, but what kind of ground was between the stream and the road was not very clear.</p>
<p>Destroying this large amount of gasoline was not an easy task. The method I had in mind was to open dozens of oil drums in the bottom row of this mountain of gasoline, simply prying open a small hole in each drum with some iron tool, and then drawing as much oil as possible from the oil pool with a spout, spreading it all over this ten-zhang square area, preferably letting the oil flow towards the drum piles. In this way, with just a match, this work area could immediately become a sea of fire, and the openings of the bottom row of gasoline drums could immediately catch fire. As long as these oil drums caught fire, the firepower would be so great that they would surely burn all the oil drums red and cause them to explode.</p>
<p>I told Tiger Brother about this method. Tiger Brother was extremely happy, but he scratched his head, as if there were other difficulties. We walked along the edge of the coal pile, preparing to go around from the south end of the coal pile, and also wanted to see what those tall warehouses were, whether they were really warehouses. This would only take ten or eight minutes at most, and I just hoped for unexpected new discoveries. This area was uniformly built (four warehouses?) and faced the four four-story buildings on the east side from afar, which was quite neat and spectacular.</p>
<p>When we got to the base of the warehouse wall, we saw that the north wall had not a single window opening. We went around from the east to the south, thinking there would be a large door, but who knew that these two high walls only had three rows of small circular windows from bottom to top, each row about eight or nine feet apart, and the area was very small, just a kind of ventilation device. This confirmed that this must be a warehouse. When we got to the western corner, there was a device like a large door at this corner, with two white characters "出口" (Exit) on it, each more than a foot square. I approached it and touched it with my hand, knowing that it was made of steel plate, but it was a whole large piece, without any handles or anything like that, and the whole piece was embedded in the wall, more than a foot deep. I knew that this thing must be controlled by electricity; to open it, you had to start the electric switch and let it slowly rise. From this, I knew that this warehouse must be an arsenal.</p>
<p>We hurriedly ran along the wall to the north end, where there was a door at the corner like the one on the south end, with the two large characters "人口" (Entrance). Just as we were about to rush back to the gasoline drum area to start working, we suddenly heard "Dong, dong" twice, as if it was above our heads. This sound seemed to be coming from a loudspeaker. Tiger Brother and I were startled when we heard this sound. There was nowhere to hide here, so we had to shrink our bodies as much as possible and crouch in the corner of the wall.</p>

<p>Billion National Assembly Hall   Shao Fu</p>
<p>Today, more than a thousand representatives from across the country will gather in the magnificent National Assembly Hall on Guofu Road in Nanjing to discuss state affairs. This grand building was completed before the War of Resistance and has taken almost ten years to truly fulfill its mission. It can be said that its fate has been full of twists and turns.</p>
<p>I have a special affection for this building, not because it hosted a performance of "La Traviata" nine years after it was completed, which I enjoyed, but because in early September last year, after the victory, I flew from Chongqing to Nanjing for the first time and returned to Nanjing after eight years. The first place I stayed was the National Assembly Hall. Although it was quite dilapidated at that time, almost empty, I dare say that everyone in our returning capital group felt very close to this building.</p>
<p>The National Assembly Hall in Nanjing reminds me of the one below Fuxing Pass in Chongqing. After that building was completed, it only hosted one session of the Political Consultative Conference and was subsequently destroyed by enemy bombing. In the rear during the war, with such difficult material conditions, the central government still spent huge sums to build such a grand assembly hall, which shows the government's determination to hold the National Assembly.</p>
<p>In terms of the surrounding environment, atmosphere, and scenery, the assembly hall in Chongqing was far superior to the one on Guofu Road in Nanjing. Unfortunately, that site has now been redeveloped into a National Sports Field.</p>
<p>Zhou Fohai: No Mercy!   Hong Guo</p>
<p>Please Government Must Uphold Original Sentence</p>
<p>The "mystery" of the traitor Zhou Fohai has finally been revealed before justice and national law! We, as the people, hope that everything in the country is on the right track. Hearing this news that the authorities are enforcing the law like a mountain, we can't help but applaud and support it. Unexpectedly, there are even people with connections who say, "We thought that Zhou Fohai, although nominally participating in the puppet government for eight years, was actually beneficial to the people; for example, issuing counterfeit money could indeed resist enemy military tickets, so that the people who had lost government protection could still live in peace. Zhou has now been punished for the crime of traitor and has been sentenced to death, we all feel that the sentence is too heavy"!</p>
<p>The traitor Zhou colluded with the enemy and committed evil deeds first, and then made contributions by contacting our comrades in the War of Resistance later. On one hand, he made a fortune through the Central Reserve Bank notes, and on the other hand, he left himself a way out. If this kind of traitor is not put to death, who will be willing to participate in the War of Resistance if there is a second Sino-Japanese War in the future? We feel that the above-mentioned argument of harboring a traitor with ulterior motives is worthy of attention; therefore, after Zhou has already been sentenced to death in the first instance, we must continue to cry out: Please the government must uphold the original sentence. Everything else can be lost, but the hearts of the people cannot be lost! The people of the country all say that Zhou Fohai should be killed, without mercy!</p>
<p>Seek it from Within   Wu Jun</p>
<p>Six Japanese ships with Band-Aid flags have appeared on the Huangpu River, causing a lot of commotion and making people as nervous as a bow reflected in a cup, greatly alarming, but in reality, there is no need for this. The problem is very simple. If we live up to expectations, we don't need to be afraid; if we don't live up to expectations, we will not only be afraid for the rest of our lives, but also be bullied by others at any time. It's not just a small island country like Japan that will look down on us.</p>
<p>Conversely, the Sino-US Treaty of Commerce has already been signed, and it is indeed equal and reciprocal in itself, but let me ask: They have ships coming over, but do we have ships going over? They have goods coming in an endless stream, but do we have goods going out in large quantities? Therefore, they are actually taking great advantage. We can't blame them for this. Who told us not to live up to expectations?</p>
<p>Therefore, regardless of whether they are enemies or friends, if we don't live up to expectations, the enemy will certainly swallow us, and even if friends don't intend to take advantage, they will still take advantage. Let those Band-Aid ships go, ignore them, and pull ourselves together. That's the right thing to do!</p>
<p>Too Outrageous   Gui Dequ</p>
<p>A ×-style leather coat, a ×-style uniform, leather shoes...; paired with a ××-style pistol; an officer dressed like this was pacing on the sidewalk under the lights of Mingyao Road, casually looking at the shop windows along the street.</p>
<p>A merchant-like person, carrying a briefcase, walked over and carelessly bumped into the officer.</p>
<p>The merchant looked, saw that it was nothing, and continued to walk forward; the officer turned around and chased after him;</p>
<p>"Slap, slap!" Two slaps to the left and right of the other person's face, "Damn it, don't you have any manners?"</p>
<p>"You... hit..."</p>
<p>"Damn it, what if I hit you? You have no manners, go to hell!" Saying that, he gave two more slaps: "Slap, slap."</p>
<p>The merchant hurriedly apologized, bowed, kowtowed, and said sorry.</p>
<p>The result was probably still so-called "going to the team."</p>
<p>The crowd of onlookers shook their heads and sighed. One of the more clever ones said:</p>
<p>"Go home and sleep!"</p>
<p>So the clever people mostly went home to "sleep"—peace, long live!</p>
<p>Marriage Advertisement   Hu Mu</p>
<p>Originally, I wasn't superstitious, but when I was bored, I passed a fortune teller who said I would have a letter this year. I consulted my friends and placed a marriage advertisement in a newspaper, which read: "I was unfortunately born in China, and even more unfortunately grew up in a troubled world. I originally studied politics, but now I am in the military. In times of utter spiritual desolation and poverty, I wish to find a girlfriend to be my wife. The respondents should be the daughters of those who made a fortune from national disasters, or the daughters of those who unscrupulously seized land and robbed people. I don't care about their academic qualifications, only how many gold bars they have, how many houses they own. I don't care about their looks, only whether they don't have pockmarks or limp. Applicants should submit an autobiography, two photos, and a certificate from the Central Hospital proving they have no incurable diseases, and send them to Mr. ×× at ×× Bridge, ×× Road, ×××, this city, for forwarding!"</p>
<p>This advertisement was published in Nanjing newspapers, but no one responded. I am specially copying the original text to "Free Talk" as an article for publication. Readers, please give your advice!</p>
<p>Fire in a Carriage   Xia Yefeng</p>
<p>According to someone from Nanjing, on the 4th of this month, the 5th special express train leaving Nanjing caught fire in a third-class carriage near Benniu. The order was immediately disrupted. The driver heard the sound and braked after about half an hour, but two people had already jumped out of the train and died.</p>
<p>It is said that the cause of the fire was due to a passenger carelessly throwing a cigarette butt into the window panel.</p>
<p>The Chinese have never paid much attention to public morality, especially smoking at will in public places. They only care about having a cigarette in hand and enjoying themselves, regardless of whether others are suffering from headaches and dizziness, or even causing the tragedy of a fire in the carriage this time.</p>
<p>Speaking of smoking, I am reminded of the etiquette of smoking. In other countries, when smoking in public places, if there are women present, you must first obtain their consent and politely ask: "Madam! May I smoke a cigarette?"</p>
<p>Foreigners love freedom, but they also respect the freedom of others at the same time. In this regard, we should learn. This is good etiquette, which is worth considering for our "noble" compatriots who only love their own freedom and disregard the freedom of others.</p>
<p>Smoking in public places (except at banquets) is already very reluctant, let alone smoking leisurely on a crowded train. Isn't it too disregarding the freedom of others?</p>
<p>Therefore, it is necessary to prohibit smoking in the carriage, and it should be strictly enforced.</p>
<p>A train fire, becoming a "fire" train, is probably the first time this has happened on the Beijing-Shanghai line after the victory! After this "lesson," the railway authorities should also pay attention and not neglect smoking passengers, or neglect cigarette butts that can start a prairie fire, for the safety of all passengers!</p>
<p>Cotton and Livestock   Hu Yan</p>
<p>It is said that the number one import of our country is cotton, and the number one export is livestock.</p>
<p>Our country has always been known as an agricultural country, and cotton is a truly local product, but the import of cotton ranks first! From this, it can be seen that although it has been more than a year since the victory, the rural areas have not recovered, and the strong laborers have not returned to farming. Although the land is vast and the resources are abundant, there is still nothing that can be done.</p>
<p>For a product like cotton, as long as there are seeds, land, and manpower, even in our country, where machinery is very lacking, we can find ways to increase production. Setting up supervisory offices in various provinces, providing seeds, providing agricultural loans, and rewarding cotton planting, with everyone working together, we can achieve the goal of increasing production in just one year. Instead of thinking about it from the root, only knowing how to desperately import foreign cotton, isn't it ridiculous? Isn't it scary?</p>
<p>It is really puzzling what exactly the number one export of livestock is. Is it pandas? There probably aren't that many. If I had to guess, it would probably be things like chickens, ducks, and pigs, but our country has never had a large output of these animals. Now, desperately exporting these livestock will eventually lead to a lack of succession. Moreover, it is also somewhat ridiculous and scary for a country to lack livestock as a major export product.</p>
<p>In terms of our country's current economic situation, the number one import should be machinery. On one hand, we should hire foreign engineers and train our technicians, and desperately produce to slightly alleviate the people's difficulties. The number one export should be minerals, silk, tung oil, and eggs; these items have fewer uses in the country and should be collectively purchased and sold overseas by officials and merchants to strive for a balance of imports and exports.</p>
<p>Looking at our import and export goods, I can't help but express the above complaints. Of course, complaints are valuable at the moment!</p>

<p>The Old Revolutionary, Tan Zhen   Dun Fu</p>
<p>The Recently Retired Vice President of the Judicial Yuan</p>
<p>Forty-five years ago, the Changde Middle School in Hunan Province held an opening ceremony for the completion of its library. When the principal finished reading his grand and eloquent speech and was about to dismiss the meeting, a student with a rustic appearance suddenly strode onto the stage, bowed to the teachers and students present, and then gave a grand "speech," scolding the corruption of the Qing court at the time, the Empress Dowager's licentiousness, and praising Kang Youwei and Liang Qichao without reservation. Such "heresy"—at that time, the Empress Dowager was in power. It should have been punishable by death without a doubt. Fortunately, Zhu Shuyi, the prefect of Changde (i.e., the father of Zhu Jingnong), tried his best to protect him and "expelled him from school and deported him." This student who was regarded as "rebellious" was none other than the current Vice President of the Judicial Yuan, Tan Zhen.</p>
<p>After Tan was expelled from school, he studied at Waseda University in Japan. At that time, Japan, at the request of the Qing court, promulgated "Regulations for Overseas Students" to crack down on revolutionary elements among the overseas students. Chen Tianhua, an overseas student from Hunan, committed suicide in the sea out of indignation because of this. All the overseas students packed up and returned to China. Tan founded the Western Road Public School in Hunan and served as its principal. Just as the Qing court was vigorously suppressing the revolution, our Mr. Tan became "restless" again and openly buried Chen Tianhua on Yuelu Mountain. The Qing officials were furious and ordered his arrest. Tan then slipped back to Japan. A year later, thinking that nothing would happen, he slipped back again, but this time, it was terrible and he became a fish that voluntarily jumped into the net.</p>
<p>This time, Tan's life was originally "over," but he did not die. The reason was that the prefect of Hunan Province had some "love for talent." With the help of the prefect's mediation, Tan only received the punishment of being "escorted back to his hometown and imprisoned for life."</p>
<p>When Puyi ascended the throne, it was customary to grant a general amnesty, but our Mr. Tan was in the "ten unpardonable crimes" category and did not receive any "Great Qing grace." However, before long, the Wuchang Uprising broke out, and the whole country responded. Tan was released from prison, changing from a prisoner to a member of the provisional Senate.</p>
<p>When the Kuomintang was reorganized in 1924, he served as a member of the first Central Executive Committee. In 1932, he was elected Vice President of the Legislative Yuan, and later transferred to the Vice President of the Judicial Yuan until now.</p>
<p>Tan's courtesy name is Liming, and he is from Taoyuan, Hunan. His personality has always been informal, and his life is completely ordinary. Before becoming the Vice President, he was often associated with pawnshops. Although he now holds an important position, his situation is still not very good. He is not particular about food and drink, but he likes to eat dog meat and turtle meat. In the past, he was a vanguard of the revolution, but now he has long since "concealed his edge and hidden his sharpness," and no longer has the "drawn sword and cocked bow" temper of his early years. He is cheerful and does not know that old age is coming. Wait a minute! Not long ago, didn't the newspaper say that Vice President Tan resigned due to old age? It is really unbelievable that such an optimistic and open-minded person would suddenly think of "old age." Moreover, Tan is only sixty-three years old this year, which cannot be considered very old. The Central Government has also sent a letter to persuade him to stay. I hope Tan will release the spirit of his early years and be a civil servant for another twenty years!</p>

<p>Special Issue Commemorating the Founding Father's Birthday</p>
<p>The Founding Father's Constitutional Ideal</p>
<p>This Newspaper's Data Room</p>
<p>For forty years, the Founding Father led the national revolution with the implementation of constitutional government as the ultimate goal of his politics. He explored the advantages and disadvantages of constitutional government in various countries and believed that the root of the problem with the rights-based constitutions of European and American countries was that the power of examination was subordinate to the executive power, and the power of impeachment was subordinate to the legislative power. Therefore, during implementation, various malpractices were inevitable. In ancient China, the application of the three-power constitution already existed, but the legislative, judicial, and executive powers were subordinate to the power of the monarch, and although the power of examination and the power of impeachment were nominally independent, they were still easily controlled by the power of the monarch. The Founding Father, understanding China's political traditions and actual needs, created the five-power constitution. He said in "The Three Principles of the People": "Establishing the five-power constitution is to remedy the past incompleteness. We now want to combine China's examination power and supervision power with the central power and judicial power, to form a very good and complete system, creating a government with five powers separated. Such a government is the most complete and best government in the world. With such a good government, the country can achieve a country of the people, by the people, and for the people." This is the Founding Father's ideal of the five-power constitution.</p>
<p>From the perspective of ideology, the Principle of Democracy in the Three Principles of the People is precisely the embodiment of the five-power constitution. And its perfect application depends on the division of powers and functions and the system of balanced powers. The Founding Father said: "With regard to the country's politics, the fundamental thing is that the people have power; as for those who manage the government, they should be entrusted to competent specialists. The people should have four political rights: election, recall, initiative, and referendum. These political rights are the rights of the people. Government power is five kinds of governing rights: legislative, executive, examination, supervision, and judicial. Division of labor, checks and balances, mutual assistance, and cooperation can enable the government to achieve omnipotence."</p>
<p>Implementing constitutional government and returning sovereignty to the people has always been the Founding Father's consistent ideal. In the Provisional Constitution of the Republic of China, which was formulated in Nanjing, there is a clause stating that "The sovereignty of the Republic of China belongs to the entire body of citizens," which was originally proposed by the Founding Father. In the sixth chapter of "Sun Wen's Doctrine," the process by which the state enters constitutional government is also described in detail: "The period of revolutionary progress is divided into three stages: First, the military government period, which is the period of destruction. Second, the transitional period: with a county as an autonomous unit...limited to three years...After the country is pacified for six years, each county that has achieved complete autonomy shall elect one representative to organize the National Assembly to formulate the five-power constitution...After the constitution is formulated, and the president and members are elected, the revolutionary government shall</p>

<p>The National Assembly and the Constitution</p>
<p>Our Newspaper Archives</p>
<p>In July of the 26th year of the Republic of China, the re-elections in various provinces and cities were being intensified, and it was expected that they would all be completed within one or two months to prepare for the convocation of the National Assembly. At this moment, the July 7th Incident occurred, and a full-scale and long-term war of resistance began. The government devoted all its efforts to resisting the strong enemy, and most of the elected representatives from all parties were assigned to the front lines and rear areas to perform tasks directly related to the war of resistance, and were unable to spare the time to attend a meeting for calm discussion. Therefore, the National Government had no choice but to issue an order on October 4th of the 26th year of the Republic of China to postpone the National Assembly. The implementation of constitutional government was thus suddenly frustrated by the Japanese invasion.</p>
<p>The Foundation of National Construction</p>
<p>Although the convocation of the National Assembly was postponed, the government's preparations for the National Assembly did not slacken even for a day during the eight years of arduous war of resistance. For those provinces and cities where representatives had not been fully elected due to the outbreak of the war of resistance, elections were actively continued. Representatives from provinces such as Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hubei, Hunan, Sichuan, Xikang, Shanxi, Henan, Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, Qinghai, Fujian, Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan, Guizhou, Suiyuan, Xinjiang, and cities such as Nanjing, Shanghai, Qingdao, and Xijing were elected one after another, and the elections of professional representatives in various provinces were also gradually completed. At the same time, although the government was unwilling to hastily convene a National Assembly during the war of resistance, in order to gather ideas and benefit from all sources, and to enable talents from all over the country to devote their efforts to seeking victory in the war of resistance and success in national construction, it established a National Political Council with the spirit of the National Assembly in the 27th year of the Republic of China. Many democratically elected representatives of the National Assembly from various provinces and cities were recruited to jointly discuss national affairs. By the autumn of the 32nd year of the Republic of China, the domestic and international situations were both favorable to our war of resistance, and victory was already in sight. The government felt more and more that the post-war national construction should be laid on a solid foundation before the victory. Therefore, when the Fifth Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee of the Kuomintang was held in September of that year, a very detailed discussion was held on the issue of implementing constitutional government, and a resolution on the general report on the implementation was passed as follows:</p>
<p>"At the opening of this plenary session, the President instructed and encouraged comrades with "promoting the actual implementation of constitutional government". After listening to the general report on the progress of the implementation of constitutional government, this meeting deeply feels that even in the face of the serious national crisis of the Japanese invasion, the work of implementing constitutional government can still inherit the legacy of the Prime Minister and carry forward the consistent spirit of the Party's decades of sacrifice and struggle for constitutional government, overcome difficulties, and make efforts to move forward. Now that the victory in the war of resistance is in sight and the foundation of constitutional government has been laid, the whole country should concentrate its efforts to strive for victory and consolidate unity, adhere to the spirit of resisting the war and building the country,恪遵the Prime Minister's hand-written provisions of the Outline of National Construction, convene the National Assembly as soon as possible, and promulgate a law that is believed and adhered to by the whole country, in order to complete the great cause of national construction."</p>
<p>In this resolution, it was also announced that the government would convene the National Assembly within one year after the end of the war to formulate a constitution, and the date of implementation would be determined by the National Assembly.</p>
<p>After the Eleventh Plenary Session of the Central Committee, the National Political Council held a meeting in Chongqing. In order to step up the preparations for constitutional government, a resolution was passed at the meeting to recommend to the Supreme National Defense Council the establishment of the "Association for the Promotion of Constitutional Government Implementation". The Supreme National Defense Council accepted this suggestion, and the "Association for the Promotion of Constitutional Government Implementation" was formally established on November 12th of the 32nd year of the Republic of China. On New Year's Day of the 33rd year of the Republic of China, the Association for the Promotion of Constitutional Government Implementation launched the "National People's Discussion on the Draft Constitution Movement". This movement aroused a wide and enthusiastic response. Many issues of the draft constitution, such as the national capital, the rights and obligations of the people, the organization and functions of the National Assembly, and the division of power between the central and local governments, have aroused enthusiastic discussions in various aspects, and have gained many valuable results.</p>
<p>The preparations for constitutional government have gradually reached a mature stage. In May of the 34th year of the Republic of China, the Japanese invaders were retreating on various battlefields. In view of the fact that victory was in sight, the government decided to end the period of political tutelage early, return political power to the people, and implement a democratic constitutional government. Therefore, the Sixth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang was held in Chongqing and passed a resolution: "The date for the convocation of the National Assembly is set for November 12th of this year." All parties are also stepping up preparations.</p>
<p>In August of the same year, Japan declared unconditional surrender, and the whole country was busy with the work of accepting surrender and returning to civilian life. At that time, the originally scheduled date for the convocation of the National Assembly was approaching, but the domestic political disputes were also becoming increasingly acute. In order to seek stability and unity after the victory, the government did not hesitate to make compromises and convened a Political Consultative Conference of representatives from various parties and social elites to discuss the plan for the country to transition from wartime to peacetime and from resistance to national construction. The Political Consultative Conference opened in Chongqing on January 10th of the 35th year of the Republic of China. Although the scope of its discussions also included issues such as the cessation of military conflicts and the reorganization of the National Government, the most important, most difficult, most contentious, and most delayed resolutions were still the issues of the draft constitution and the National Assembly. The Political Consultative Conference opened on January 10th and closed on the afternoon of the 31st. The most thorny issue of the allocation of additional seats for the National Assembly was only agreed upon at the group meeting that morning.</p>
<p>After the Political Consultative Conference closed, the "Resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference" were published on February 1st, of which items 4 and 5 were related to the draft constitution and the National Assembly. Regarding the draft constitution, the Political Consultative Conference passed a "Principles for Amending the Draft Constitution". As Chairman Chiang pointed out at the closing ceremony of the Political Consultative Conference, this principle of amendment does not have any binding power on the future National Assembly in legal theory, but only provides the National Assembly with "adoption". However, there was an understanding between the various parties in the Political Consultative Conference that everyone would strive to ensure that these principles of amendment could be passed in the future convened National Assembly. Therefore, although these revised principles do not have a legal status, they also have their factual weight. The amending principles are divided into twelve items, but the joint meeting of the Political Consultative Conference Comprehensive Group and the Draft Constitution Review and Consultation Group later proposed three amendments to these amending principles. These two documents are very important, and readers can conduct comparative research and reference.</p>
<p>Regarding the National Assembly, the following eight points were passed in the resolution of the Political Consultative Conference.</p>
<p>(1) The National Assembly will be convened on May 5th of the 35th year of the Republic of China.</p>
<p>(2) The powers of the First National Assembly are to formulate the constitution.</p>
<p>(3) The passage of the constitution requires the consent of three-quarters of the representatives present.</p>
<p>(4) The 1,200 regional and professional representatives stipulated in the election law remain unchanged.</p>
<p>(5) 150 new regional and professional representatives from Taiwan, the Northeast, and other regions will be added.</p>
<p>(6) 700 representatives from parties and social elites will be added. The distribution will be determined separately.</p>
<p>(7) The total number of representatives to the National Assembly is 2,050.</p>
<p>(8) The constitutional organs established in accordance with the Constitution shall be elected and convened in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution within six months of the promulgation of the Constitution.</p>
<p>The allocation of these 700 new representatives in point 6 is written in the resolution as "to be determined separately". It was mentioned above that this issue was the most controversial and the latest to be resolved at the meeting, but although it was not recorded in the resolution, all parties at the meeting had agreed. That is, of the 700 newly added representatives, the Kuomintang accounted for 230, the Communist Party 200, the Democratic League 100, the Youth Party 100, and social elites 70. The Kuomintang and the Communist Party agreed to give up 10 seats each to the Democratic League. So the result was that the Kuomintang had 220, the Communist Party 190, the Democratic League 120, the Youth Party 100, and the social elites 70. This was the tacit understanding of all parties, and it was not recorded in the resolution.</p>
<p>The Task of the Assembly</p>
<p>The convening of the National Assembly on May 5th of the 35th year of the Republic of China was originally passed by the Political Consultative Conference and unanimously agreed by all parties. However, as the convening date approached, the Chinese Communist Party and the Democratic League refused to submit a list of representatives, citing some other reasons, so that some representatives of the National Assembly had to return home in disappointment even though they had arrived in Nanjing to wait for the meeting. In order to implement the original intention of democratic constitutional government, the government could not bear to see the efforts to prepare for constitutional government for more than ten years fall short, so it had to announce the postponement of the National Assembly to November 12th.</p>
<p>Now, the first National Assembly in Chinese history has been scheduled to open in the capital, Nanjing. The task of this National Assembly, as we mentioned briefly in the first section, is to formulate the constitution and determine the date of implementation of the constitution, but does not include the implementation of the constitution. This point seems to need a little explanation so that we can have a true understanding of the goals and tasks of this National Assembly. We know that the constitution is the fundamental law of a country, and it can show the importance and dignity of the constitution by having a specially established body discuss and formulate it in detail from a detached standpoint. In various European and American countries, the procedures for drafting the constitution have also gone through this stage. For example, after the independence of the United States, in 1787, representatives from various states held a constitutional convention in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The meeting lasted for four months before the draft constitution was completed and submitted to the temporary national assemblies organized by various states for approval. By 1790, the thirteen states had ratified it one after another, and it became the constitution of the United States of America today. For example, the first Republican Constitution after the French Revolution was also formulated by a specially established constitutional body, and then submitted to the citizens for a vote. Furthermore, according to the Organizational Law of the National Assembly, the National Assembly is a constitutional body, which shows that it existed before the constitution. However, the National Assembly that exercises the constitution must be organized in accordance with the provisions of the constitution, which shows that the two are completely different and should not be confused. If the National Assembly established without following the constitution can exercise the powers of the National Assembly stipulated in the constitution, it is legally untenable. Therefore, the constitutional body and the constitutional body must be separated. Secondly, the draft constitution is drafted by the Legislative Yuan, promulgated by the government, and the people can fully express their opinions and make amendments. The transmission of the people's opinions must naturally go through the representatives of the National Assembly elected by the people during the discussion. The National Assembly has a meeting period of only twenty days. If, in addition to drafting the constitution, it is also necessary to show the various issues of implementing the constitution, it may not be possible in fact. Finally, Article 23 of the Outline of National Construction also stipulates that "when more than half of the provinces in the country have reached the beginning of the constitutional government, that is, the completion of local autonomy in the whole province, the National Assembly shall be opened to formulate and promulgate the constitution." It can be seen that the National Assembly is an institution that existed before the constitution, and its task is to formulate the constitution and not to implement the constitution, which is the legacy of the Founding Father. Therefore, this National Assembly should be called the "Constitutional Convention" or the "Constitutional Assembly" in essence. The real National Assembly must be organized according to Chapter 3 of the Constitution after the Constitution is formally passed. Therefore, in this conference, Chapter 3 of the Constitution concerning the articles of the "National Assembly" is likely to become the center of heated debate.</p>
<p>During these twenty days, the highest code of law for the founding of the Republic of China will be produced, the preamble to the democratic constitutional government, the ultimate goal of the national revolution, will be unveiled, and China will be led to a new historical step. Today, the eyes of 450 million people in China will be on Nanjing, on these more than 2,000 representatives. The National Assembly bears such a sacred and important task, let us wish it complete success in advance.</p>

<p>Zhu Jingnong made a special trip to Nanjing to report. As soon as he arrived at the reporting office, he was surrounded by a group of reporters, talking about the operation of the Commercial Press. When he went through the formalities, he was all smiles. The seat he drew was No. 525, and Yun said: "Fortunately, fortunately, it's not too far."</p>
<p>Among the representatives who have reported, there are the most legislators. Obviously, these legislative experts will definitely show their skills in this conference.</p>
<p>The number drawn by Wang Xiaolai was 1478. There was a young military officer wearing a military uniform and an air force second lieutenant next to him. After he went upstairs to go through the formalities and collect the food and accommodation expenses for him, he walked out the door. Wang talked to him in a low voice with a kind and amiable attitude. Some people said that he might be his young master. (Special Correspondent Ding Kuanghua)</p>
<h3 id="e116">The Evolution of the Organizational Law of the National Assembly and the Election Law of Representatives Chen Yuxiang <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>(The above article continues from page 14)</p>
<p>As for why people oppose the validity of the old representatives? The reason can be represented by the five propositions on the National Assembly issued by the Democratic League on March 10th of the 34th year of the Republic of China. The main points are summarized as follows:</p>
<p>1. In the recent eight or nine years, China has experienced an unprecedented foreign war in history, and the world has experienced an unprecedented war, which has had a profound impact on people's psychology and their political awareness. It is practically impossible to use the representatives elected eight or nine years ago to reflect the public opinion that has undergone great changes in the past eight or nine years. Moreover, the draft constitution promulgated by the National Government clearly stipulates that the term of office of the National Assembly representatives is six years. It is only because after six years, the people's intentions cannot but have great changes, and it is natural that their representatives should be re-elected. If the representatives elected in the 24th and 25th years of the Republic of China are still valid, they have exceeded the term of office stipulated in the constitution. If the first National Assembly representatives who have the right to enact the constitution take the lead in setting this bad precedent of violating the spirit of constitutional government, what kind of bad impression will it give the people? This is one.</p>
<p>2. According to the provisions of the National Assembly Representative Election Law, citizens who are 20 years old have the right to vote, and citizens who are 25 years old have the right to be elected. After these eight or nine years, all citizens who were 11 or 12 years old before the war have obtained their legal right to vote today, and all citizens who were 15 or 16 years old before the war have obtained their legal right to be elected today. The total number of both is no less than 30 million. Moreover, these young people are actually the ones who have contributed the most to the war of resistance. The first National Assembly convened to lay the foundation for the country's autonomy and constitutional government has deprived these people of their right to vote and be elected. It is unacceptable in terms of reason and emotion. This is two.</p>
<p>3. After eight years of war of resistance, the situation in various regions has changed greatly compared with before the war. If the feelings of the people in these regions are ignored, and the representatives produced before the war are still used to make various decisions that the people of the whole country must abide by, if the people in these regions rise up and complain when the conference is held, saying that these old representatives are no longer sufficient to represent the recent public opinion in these regions, will the representatives who have attended the conference and have a legal relationship with these regions not be caught in a dilemma? The adverse effects on the country are also innumerable. This is three.</p>
<p>4. When the elections were held in the 24th and 25th years of the Republic of China, it was still the time when the party power was at its peak. At that time, few parties had the opportunity to participate in the elections, and even people from all walks of life who were usually respected in society had little chance of being elected as representatives of the National Assembly. Even some wise people within the Kuomintang were dissatisfied with the election situation at that time. Now that times have changed and the world is in a high tide of democracy, which has come with the force of overwhelming force, and the urgent demand of the times is that the whole country must unite to overcome difficulties together. If we ignore the facts mentioned above and still use the old representatives produced eight or nine years ago to deal with the current difficult and difficult new situation, the so-called democratic unity is just empty talk. This is four.</p>
<p>5. The day when the National Assembly opens should be the time when the Kuomintang's party power temporarily comes to an end. However, according to Article 3 of the Organizational Law of the National Assembly, the executive and supervisory members and alternate executive and supervisory members of the Central Committee of the Kuomintang are the natural representatives of the National Assembly. According to the facts mentioned above, the election held nine years ago was originally presided over by the Kuomintang alone. Now, with the addition of these hundreds of natural representatives, will the atmosphere of one party in the future conference not be a little thick? In case the people do not understand, and suspect that "returning power to the people" is only nominal, and "legalizing party power is the actual requirement of the Kuomintang", how will the wise people within the Kuomintang explain themselves? This is five. The propositions of the Democratic League's declaration are actually the arguments of the Communist Party. As for whether these propositions have their reasons, we will not spend any time here to analyze them one by one. Readers only need to read the context of this article to understand. However, the spread of these views has hindered the convocation of the National Assembly, which is an undeniable fact. In August of the 34th year of the Republic of China, the war of resistance against Japan ended in victory, and the National Assembly was about to be convened. The Communist Party attempted to create internal chaos, so the negotiations between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party were held openly. On October 10th of the same year, the Kuomintang and the Communist Party issued a summary of the talks, stating that whether the National Assembly representatives should be re-elected and whether the Organizational Law of the National Assembly and the Election Law of Representatives should be amended should be decided by the Political Consultative Conference. The Political Consultative Conference opened in Chongqing on January 10th of the 35th year of the Republic of China, and the case of the National Assembly was one of the most debated issues at the conference.</p>
<p>Various Opinions in the Political Consultative Conference</p>
<p>When the Political Consultative Conference held its seventh meeting on January 17th, the issue of the National Assembly was included in the agenda of the day, and the discussion continued on the 18th. In the Political Consultative Conference, the opinions of all parties on the qualifications of the National Assembly representatives can be divided into (1) the old representatives are valid, (2) the old representatives are invalid, and (3) the conciliation plan.</p>
<p>First, the Kuomintang advocated that the old representatives should continue to be valid. At the meeting on the 17th, Zhang Lisheng first explained the Kuomintang delegation's views on the National Assembly, totaling four points: (1) The National Assembly will be convened on May 5th of the 35th year of the Republic of China; (2) The powers of the First National Assembly are to formulate the constitution; (3) The remaining number of representatives of the First National Assembly, in addition to those who have been elected, can be reasonably increased; (4) The Second National Assembly will be elected and convened in accordance with the provisions of the constitution within six months of the promulgation of the constitution. Regarding the validity of the old representatives, it is believed that it cannot be denied. Zhang's words meant that there is a view in society that the National Assembly representatives who have been elected should be re-elected. Our government and the ruling party also attach great importance to this view and have considered it, but as a result of consideration, there is no reason not to recognize the qualifications of the representatives who have been elected in accordance with the law in the past. There are two reasons: one is based on legal theory, and the other is based on reason and the current political situation. First of all, from the first point, we cannot find a basis in law. We see that Article 1 of the amended Organizational Law of the National Assembly stipulates that "the National Assembly formulates the constitution and determines the date of implementation of the constitution." Article 11 stipulates that "the National Assembly ends its mission after the end of the meeting." According to these two articles, the power of the National Assembly is to formulate the constitution and determine the date of implementation of the constitution. The National Assembly representatives only have this task, and there is no term of office. The government has no legal basis to remove it. Secondly, from the second point, looking at the general trend in the current political situation, what the country hopes for at present is unity and stability. The purpose of convening the Political Consultative Conference is to negotiate. Assuming that the government or any party does not recognize the qualifications of the nine hundred and several representatives who have been elected in accordance with the law in the past, and re-elect them, imagine what these hundreds of representatives will feel psychologically? Today, we believe that various parties have not been able to fully agree on their political views in the past, and we still have to painstakingly convene the Political Consultative Conference by the government. Then, whether the qualifications of these nine hundred and several representatives are recognized or cancelled, will they also organize a group, for example, organize a National Assembly Party, and express its views and wishes to the government in the same way as other parties, and then hold one or even several meetings? How will the government deal with it? Therefore, the government has no basis in law, and it cannot but recognize that the representatives elected in the past are valid in terms of reason and the current political situation.</p>
<p>Chen Lifu expressed his long opinion on the issue of the National Assembly at the Political Consultative Conference (this was his first speech at the Political Consultative Conference), in which he said that Article 2, Item 4 of the Election Law, which stipulates that the government designates 240 representatives, is a remedial measure. Although this method is not absolutely good, it is suitable for China's national conditions, because China is different from Europe and the United States. Those who are qualified to be elected and should be elected often regard themselves as noble and unwilling to run for election, so this method must be used to remedy it. As for the term of office of the representatives, the original text does not explicitly stipulate it, so there is controversy. Some people say that the representatives elected ten years ago have already expired according to the six-year term stipulated in the draft constitution, but they do not know that the term of office should be calculated from the date of assumption of office. Now the National Assembly has not yet been convened, and they have not yet assumed office, so the term of office has not only not expired, but has not actually begun. Moreover, the war of resistance has lasted for eight years, and the failure of the old representatives to take office is a special circumstance. As for the draft constitution, it has not yet been passed in accordance with the law, and it cannot be used to restrict the term of office of the representatives.</p>
<p>Wu Tiecheng made supplementary comments on maintaining the old representatives, saying that the reasons for opposing the old representatives are nothing more than two points: one is that the representatives elected in the 25th year of the Republic of China are not sufficient to represent today's public opinion, and the other is that many people who did not have the right to vote or be elected in those years have now obtained it, and their rights should not be deprived. Regarding the first point, the representatives elected in those years have mostly participated in the war of resistance and service in the past eight years. Their experience and understanding have been improved, and they are more able to represent public opinion. Regarding the second point, the number of people who have obtained the right to vote or be elected today cannot exceed the number of people who had the right to vote or be elected in those years. We should not only take care of the rights of a few people, but not recognize the election results of those who have obtained the right to vote.</p>
<p>Second, the Communist Party and the Democratic League did not recognize the validity of the old representatives. Their reasons for opposing the old representatives have been seen in the declaration of the Democratic League mentioned in the previous section, and their views held in the Political Consultative Conference are still based on this as the main content. Deng Yingchao also raised issues such as the complicated procedures for selecting representatives in the Representative Election Law. Wu Yuzhang, Zhang Junli, Guo Moruo, and others put forward the view that we cannot talk about legal principles, but must take into account the facts. If we talk about legal principles, the Political Consultative Conference is not based on law. The Political Consultative Conference is now being held because of the needs of the facts. Re-electing the old representatives is also a need of the facts, so the theory of legal principles cannot be established. Guo Moruo said that the government wants to maintain the validity of the old representatives because it is afraid that the old representatives will speak and cause social instability; various parties want to re-elect representatives because they are also afraid of causing social instability and the people want to speak. Luo Longji, representing the Democratic League, put forward the following points: (1) If the old representatives are maintained, a public opinion poll must be held, which will be held by intellectuals such as industry and commerce, culture, and students; (2) The old representatives should be used as candidates to hold miscellaneous elections; (3) The National Assembly should not be held, and experts should draft the constitution and the citizens should vote. It goes without saying that the method is impractical.</p>
<p>Third, Wang Yunwu and Shao Congen, who were non-partisan, put forward two other conciliation plans. Wang said that the government has difficulties, which is a fact, and the Communist Party's criticism is also correct. He believed that law and facts should be taken into account. He believed that the foundation of democracy lies in the rule of law. If the law is ignored, this kind of democracy is unreliable. The spirit of the rule of law is that the people should abide by the law, and the government should also abide by the law. The government cannot arbitrarily negate the law, otherwise it will conflict with the democratic position. He admitted that there is a defect in the National Assembly Organizational Law, that is, the representatives do not have a fixed term of office, and there is no way to cancel the qualifications of the representatives. He agreed to amend it, but the representatives elected in the past cannot but be maintained. Because the Kuomintang wants to return power to the people, it has the right to make a decision on how to deal with it. In addition, there are 250 representatives who have not been elected, so there are 950 seats that can be manipulated. Shao Congen advocated that the opposition parties should make concessions to the ruling party on the issue of old representatives. He also put forward a method that he said he had thought of after a night of hard thinking, that is, to solve this problem with three meetings from now on: (1) The first meeting is the Political Consultative Conference, whose task is for various parties to jointly formulate the steps to start democracy, draft and amend the National Assembly Organizational Law and Election Law, and even the Outline of the Draft Constitution, and submit a proposal; (2) The second meeting is still held on May 5th according to the government's proposal, and the Organizational Law, Election Law, and Draft Constitution that we have amended will be submitted to the conference for discussion and decision as the formal Organizational Law, Election Law, and Draft Constitution. (3) The third meeting is the meeting established according to the Organizational Law and Election Law decided by the second meeting, and its task is to draft and implement the constitution.</p>
<p>Under the circumstances that the National Assembly issue was discussed for two days without reaching a conclusion, as mentioned above, each party held its own views.</p>
<p>The Issue of Allocation of Seats for Various Parties</p>
<p>The debate on the National Assembly case in the Political Consultative Conference initially centered on the issue of whether the old representatives should be retained or abolished, and then involved the issue of the allocation of seats for various parties. On January 28th, the Democratic League still firmly believed that the legal system could not be recognized, but the need for political unity should be recognized. It advocated a political solution and attached importance to the guarantee of agreements such as the principles for amending the draft constitution (that is, it required the government to guarantee that the May 5th National Assembly could accept the principles for amending the draft constitution agreed upon by the Political Consultative Conference). Based on this so-called "political compromise" principle, the Democratic League recognized that the old representatives could be selected as a party by the Kuomintang, and the parties and non-parties should separately select new representatives. The Democratic League also proposed that the number of newly added representatives elected by the parties and non-parties should account for more than one-third of the total number, with the intention of ensuring that the new draft constitution would not be vetoed by the May 5th Congress, because at this time more than two-thirds of the representatives in the Political Consultative Conference had agreed to the provision that the draft constitution could not be passed. Due to the failure of the Kuomintang to agree to the above opinions, no agreement was reached. As for the various parties' scramble for representative seats, it was even more impossible to have any results. According to the original plan, the Political Consultative Conference was scheduled to close on January 23rd. Due to the difficulty of agreeing on various issues, it was repeatedly extended. As of the morning of the 31st, four of the five issues had been agreed upon three days ago, and only the National Assembly issue was still deadlocked. On this day, Zhou Enlai returned to Chongqing after asking the CCP Central Committee for instructions from Yan'an, so it was decided to hold a joint meeting of the Comprehensive Group and the National Assembly Group. The National Assembly issue was resolved at this point. The Political Consultative Conference also closed on the evening of January 31st. The report of the National Assembly Subcommittee of the Political Consultative Conference was adopted as follows.</p>
<p>This group was entrusted to discuss the "National Assembly Issue". After consulting the "Opinions on the National Assembly" submitted by Sun Fo and other eight members, we held six meetings and a joint meeting with the Comprehensive Subcommittee to discuss in detail. We have achieved results. We respectfully submit this report and respectfully ask for a public decision. Conveners: Yu Jiaju, Deng Yingchao. 1. The National Assembly will be convened on May 5th of the 35th year of the Republic of China. 2. The powers of the First National Assembly are to formulate the constitution. 3. The passage of the constitution requires the consent of three-quarters of the representatives present. 4. The 1,200 regional and professional representatives stipulated in the election law remain unchanged. 5. 150 new regional and professional representatives will be added from regions such as Taiwan and the Northeast. 6. 700 representatives from parties and social elites will be added, and their distribution will be determined separately. 7. The total number of representatives to the National Assembly is 2,050. 8. The constitutional organs established in accordance with the Constitution shall be elected and convened in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution within six months of the promulgation of the Constitution.</p>
<p>When we read the report of the Political Consultative Conference, one is to stipulate that the National Assembly will be convened on May 5th, and the other is to stipulate that the powers of the National Assembly are to formulate the constitution. These were all the wishes of the government, the efforts made, the orders made, the laws made, and what the government proposed in the Political Consultative Conference. Regarding the number of representatives of the National Assembly, the government originally only hoped to maintain the old representatives and make reasonable additions to the new representatives. As a result of the consultation, not only were the 900 and several representatives who had been elected recognized as valid, but the 200 and several who had not been elected were still publicly elected by the government. In addition, 700 representatives from various parties and non-parties and 150 representatives from Taiwan, the Northeast, and other regions were added, and the natural representatives and designated representatives were cancelled. This kind of reasonable addition has actually been announced by the government long ago. The remaining question is how these 700 representatives should be allocated. The Communist Party said that the total number of their representatives should be half of the total number of representatives of the Kuomintang. The Youth Party first said that their representatives should be one-tenth of the total number, and then overturned the ratio they had proposed and demanded that the party should elect 500 representatives; At the same time, various parties and factions demanded that they account for one-third of the total number of representatives, and on the other hand, the Communist Party separately demanded that they account for one-quarter of the total number. In addition to these disputes over the proportion of seats, they also demanded that the Kuomintang should guarantee that the representatives of a certain party must account for a certain percentage. After the closing of the Political Consultative Conference, there were repeated consultations, and it was finally decided that the allocation of 700 representative seats for parties and social elites was: 220 for the Kuomintang, 190 for the Communist Party, 100 for the Democratic League, 120 for the Youth Party, and 70 for non-partisan individuals.</p>
<p>The evolution of the Organizational Law of the National Assembly and the Election Law of Representatives has thus become fixed.</p>

<p>[Our Report] The Shanghai Branch of the Executive Headquarters (Xingzheng Yuan) is focusing on post-disaster reconstruction, with relief efforts gradually coming to an end. The branch has established three refugee reception centers in Shanghai and will request the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau to take over their management. The bureau has agreed to first take over the Yangshupu Second Reception Center. This is the largest of the three reception centers, still housing about 1,000 refugees. The bureau and the branch are currently in the process of taking over. Some of the center's management personnel will be temporarily retained, while others will be transferred by the Shanghai Branch of the Executive Headquarters for post-disaster reconstruction work. The vacancies will be filled by personnel dispatched by the Social Affairs Bureau, but the relief supplies will still be provided by the Executive Headquarters.</p>

<p>In addition, in order to expedite post-disaster reconstruction and assist production, the branch has prepared industrial equipment and materials for supply to various factories. Currently, the city urgently needs equipment for water and electricity machinery. Factories that need it can apply to the branch for purchase, and the branch will then submit the application to the Industrial and Mining Business Committee of the Executive Headquarters for a decision on allocation. Other factories, such as yarn factories and various industrial factories, can also apply, but due to a shortage of materials, the application qualification is limited to factories that have suffered losses due to the war. Factories established after the war will be temporarily postponed from allocation.</p>

<p>[Our Report] In the case of holders of bonds issued by the Race Club in the 23rd year of the Republic of China requesting repayment at one thousand times the face value, the District Court's Sixth Civil Chamber, presided over by Judge Xu Fuji, delivered its verdict at 10:00 AM yesterday: The defendant, the Race Club's legal representative and former Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, F.C. Maitland, etc., should repay each plaintiff for the bonds at a rate of one thousand times their face value. Specifically, Dibais, holding bonds worth 17,000 Legal Tender, should be repaid 17 million Legal Tender. Marc Far, holding bonds worth 10,000 Legal Tender, should be repaid 10 million Legal Tender. Su Meng, holding bonds worth 4,200 Legal Tender, should be repaid 4.2 million Legal Tender. Baobaer, holding bonds worth 100 Legal Tender, should be repaid 100,000 Legal Tender. Judge Xu further explained the reasons, stating that according to Article 12 of the Supplementary Civil Procedure Regulations after the restoration, the court should consider the actual situation and make a fair judgment. The two points raised by the plaintiff regarding real estate and silver prices are insufficient to be the basis. The current real estate market is also extremely sluggish and difficult to sell, and the silver currency system has long been abolished. The current black market price cannot be used as a standard either. Therefore, the court, in consideration of all aspects of the situation, has decided to repay at a rate of one thousand times. Both parties can appeal if they disagree with the judgment. According to Cai Wenda, the lawyer representing the defendant, who told the reporter, "The judgment of one thousand times cannot be said to be too heavy, nor can it be said to be too light. It is a matter of opinion, and everyone's point of view is different. The defendant will study the judgment after receiving the written verdict and then decide whether to file an appeal."</p>

<p>Mayor Wu convened a forum at 4:30 PM yesterday in the City Hall conference room, gathering executive directors of the General Labor Union and the responsible personnel of the Cost of Living Index Compilation Research Committee. Mayor Wu first addressed the meeting, stating: "I sympathize with the workers the most. This is indeed due to the circumstances. Now that the national industry and commerce are about to enter a recession, the municipal government should find ways to reduce this factor." He then gave a detailed explanation of why the price index is not the same as the cost of living index, stating: "The price index includes all kinds of consumer goods, while the cost of living index is compiled based on the goods necessary for the general public. Therefore, there are differences. What is statistically announced in this city is the necessary cost of living index, not the price index." Finally, he declared that the urgent task is labor-management coordination to overcome difficulties together and achieve development. Subsequently, Shui Xiangyun, Zhang Zhusan, and others spoke successively, resolving to seek labor-management coordination to overcome difficulties together.</p>

<p>[Our Report] Mayor Wu, at 5:30 PM yesterday, accepted an invitation from the Liaison Association of the Law School of Aurora University in this city and went to the school to give a speech. Because Mayor Wu had just held a meeting at 4:00 PM yesterday in the City Hall conference room with representatives of the General Labor Union, etc., to explain in detail the issue of the workers' cost of living index, he rushed to Aurora University to give a speech after the meeting. Therefore, the content of his speech took the cost of living index as a guide, saying that the current cost of living index in this city has a correct basis and is by no means fabricated, and that the life of workers is indeed superior to that before the war. It seems that there should be no more excessive demands, and he frequently advised students to always take "the country above all else" and "the nation first" as principles, and to work hard forever, and hoped that the civil war could end soon and China could achieve peaceful reunification.</p>

<p>[Our Report] Yu Ruixi, Director of the Taiwan Trade Bureau, recently came to Shanghai on business and spoke to reporters yesterday about the general situation of the bureau, saying: "The Trade Bureau was established in November last year. In addition to the Taiwan headquarters, there are offices in Shanghai, Hong Kong, and Japan, and the Trust Department of the Provincial Bank is entrusted in Fuzhou, and the China Vegetable Oil Factory is entrusted in Tianjin as agents. The main business is to export local products from the province and import necessary materials under the instructions of the Chief Executive's Office, in order to maintain the activities of industry and commerce. In addition, materials are exchanged with Japan through the Central Trust Bureau. In the past year, the main imports have been more than 10,000 tons of soybean cake and other fertilizers, more than 100,000 bolts of cloth, and more than 100 vehicles. The main exports, in addition to Taiwan Sugar, are Formosa tea, camphor, and fruit. The latest batch of barter materials with Japan includes more than 1,000 bags of flax seeds departing from Osaka. As for Taiwan's general industry, it has not fully recovered. Taking the most important sugar industry as an example, the current monthly production is only a few thousand tons. The main difficulty is the lack of funds and the difficulty of turnover. Yu believes that development will not be easy without absorbing foreign funds. In addition, the soybean cake and other fertilizers transported from the mainland, although still applicable to the soil of Taiwan Province, are too costly, costing 400,000 to 500,000 Legal Tender per ton, while the higher quality American fertilizer powder costs only about 300,000 Legal Tender per ton. Therefore, the bureau has recently ordered 200,000 tons of fertilizer powder from UNRRA."</p>

Gu was unable to attend due to illness and requested a postponement. Zhou and Fan were secretly questioned by the prosecutor at 10:30 AM for an hour and a quarter. Because the case was relatively minor, they were ordered to return home separately without bail.</p>

<p>[Our Report] Gong Yongqing, who once served as the Secretary-General of the Puppet Changzhou District Court and the Secretary-General of the Puppet Changzhou Local Maintenance Association, hid in Shanghai after the victory. He was spotted by the victim Lu Lianzhen at the intersection of Jiujiang Road the afternoon before yesterday. He immediately called the police and took him to the Laozha Police Branch Bureau. Because the case involves suspicion of treason, he was sent to the High Procuratorate yesterday, where he was questioned by the prosecutor and ordered to be detained in Zhongjian Prison in Shanghai Prison for investigation of his crimes in the coming days.</p>

<p>[Our Report] In the case of the Fook Kee Construction Company suspected of concealing enemy property, the District Procuratorate interrogated Shen Wenyuan yesterday and summoned Sun Qinchi, Zhou Fushan, and Zhou Zhangshi for questioning.

<p>[Our Report] The Sanbei Steamship Company has resumed business in Shanghai after the victory. The Changxing, Mingxing, Yongjia, Ruitai, and Yuanhengli Liang vessels have been successively repaired and resumed navigation. Recently, the Long'an vessel, which was berthed in Chongqing, was towed to Shanghai for repairs. The repairs have now been completed, and the trial run the day before yesterday was successful. It is berthed at the Dada Wharf in Nanshi. Last night, a banquet was held on the ship to entertain guests until around 9:00 PM, when the host and guests dispersed happily. The vessel has a gross tonnage of 1,500 tons and a cargo capacity of 1,000 tons. After this repair, the passenger cabins were refurbished and repainted. The special class can accommodate 20 people, the first class 24 people, and the third class 154 people. The third-class equipment is equivalent to the second class, because the vessel does not have second or fourth-class equipment. It will set sail for Hankou for the first time at dawn this morning, and both cargo and passengers are fully booked.</p>
<p>The Java Company's Zhida Jia arrived in Shanghai on the 9th and set sail for Java yesterday afternoon at 1:00 PM, loading more than 100 tons of UNRRA goods to Hong Kong, with more than 600 passengers, most of whom are going to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>The China Union Company's Hualian vessel returned to Shanghai from Tianjin this time and arrived at Wusongkou on the evening of the 10th. It was originally scheduled to enter the port yesterday morning, but because a child among the passengers had meningitis, it anchored outside the port and was inspected and disinfected by the quarantine station before entering the port around 3:00 PM yesterday and berthed at the Huangpu Wharf. It has been rescheduled to set sail for Qinhuangdao next Thursday afternoon. The reason for the change to Qinhuangdao, it is said, is that there is a shortage of new fuel and beverages. If it is transshipped from Tianjin, it will delay the shipping schedule and be uneconomical.</p>
