<p>〔中央社南京三日電〕蔣主席偕夫人，三日上午十一時自漢口飛抵南京，此爲勝利以來，主席第三次蒞京，亦即我萬民愛戴之元首正式自渝凱旋還都。連日京中正以極度興奮之情緒，籌備五五還都大典，主席之來，無疑使翹待中之八十萬市民，興奮達於最高潮。三日主席座機「美齡」號係由空軍中校余復恩駕駛，隨行者計二十餘人，主席偕夫人下機時，欣然微笑，並向在場照料之周主任至柔頻頻道好，旋即驅車直駛官邸休息，此時明故宮機塲內，雖因事前遵主席之諭，而未有歡迎人負，但機塲外圍，市民聞訊成羣麕集，主席車過時，仍接到千萬無限熱情之注目禮。午後三時主席於官邸茶會招待美前總統胡佛，五時主席由馬市畏陪同驅車巡視市區，由國府路經太平路，中正路，中山北路直抵下關。主席對南京市政多所指示，對市府設立工業區之計劃表示贊同，並指示市區內於路兩旁空地宜由政府徵收，建築房屋，以壯市容。又訊，蔣夫人三日午後四時半，應馬歇爾元帥之邀，往訪馬歇爾夫人。</p>

<h3>杜魯門總統發表聲明　助中韓經濟發展　派鮑萊來華調查東北工業</h3>
<p>〔法新聞社華盛頓二日電〕杜魯門總統本日在記者招待會席上發表談話，略謂：本人派遣鮑萊君爲處理遠東賠償問題之私人代表，鮑君來日前往遠東時，將調査中國東九省朝鮮及各種資源。其他關係各國政府對於鮑萊此行，業已接到通知，余確信鮑萊可進入東九省境內，進行調査工作。總統旋即宜讀聲明一件，其中引證國務副卿艾契森之言論，即鮑萊定本星期杪徇政府及國務院之請前往遠東一項言論，聲明中鄭重宣稱：「美國目標所在，乃在支持並扶植中國及朝鮮之團結與經濟發展，同時並確保各該國在經濟上對日本居於獨立地位。艾契森君曾稱：東亞長期和平經濟發展計劃倘使實現，則中國必須充分利用其大然資源及東九省各種工業，朝鮮則必須處於發展其自身資源之地位，旨哉斯言。鮑萊君此行，當作種種研究與調査，以謀就東九省及朝鮮之工業，經濟及衛生之發展，提出各項調整的及合理的方案，並利用日本各項賠償，發展各該國天然資源。鮑萊君於任務完畢之後所作結論，當根據各項確切事實及一致的意見，鮑氏之一言一動，將以美國各種廣大的觀點爲依歸，此種觀點則以遠東之復興計劃爲基礎，以謀擴大該區數百萬居民之設展機會。要之，此行主要目的，乃在獲得各項情報，並條陳各種意見，俾協助美國政府及其各盟國，爲遠東擬訂一種方案，從而貢獻於遠東及全世界之和平與安全」。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓三日電〕杜魯門總統招待記者，宣布鮑萊赴朝鮮及中國東北調査之最後計劃。並稱：鮑萊之調査工作，勢將使美國及蘇聯在亞洲東北部之經濟利益發生衝突，鮑萊任務，實屬重大之極。白宮公布，工業化學石汕及其他專家等二十人，將共同協助調査究竟東北及朝鮮物資何者已爲蘇聯搬去，所餘尙有若干，據悉：關於派鮑萊赴東北及朝鮮調査事，美國前已正式通知蘇聯，並請蘇聯予以合作，惟迄今尙未獲得保證，除非蘇聯保證與美國合作，鮑萊或不能進入朝鮮蘇軍佔領區域，或現仍由蘇軍佔領之東北各地，由公布之鮑萊任務觀之，美蘇經濟政策似已開始發生衝突。</p>

<h3>蔣夫人指示　漢婦運工作</h3>
<p>提倡識字辦托兒所</p>

<h3>梅逆思平在京審結　首都高院九日宣判　褚逆民誼之妻代夫申請覆判</h3>
<p>〔本報南京三日電〕首都高院今晨開審梅逆思平，朝天宮內人山人海，因無旁聽證被擯於法庭前廣塲上者，達三千餘人。九時正，鳴鐘三下後，法警高呼開庭，審判長趙琛，推事葛之覃，鄭禮鍔，撿察官李師沆，書記官徐軍五人，戴方帽披法衣魚貫入庭升座，全塲肅然，而廣塲上則人羣騷動，紛紛讓道，四法警監押梅逆入庭。梅衣淡灰色花呢夾袍着黃皮鞋，默坐右側訴訟關係人席候審，法庭空氣頓形緊張，人皆欲一睹過去曾經煊赫一時的巨奸，後排旁聽人紛紛登高引頸遙望，其時銀光閃爍，「開麥拉」聲大起，（中電）攝影師東西奔忙，各報社攝影記者大起活躍，或踞蹲或仰立，顯出種種美妙形勢，以覓取適當角度。梅逆於萬目睽睽下，尙不知羞，在扭頸四望，看有多少人在指數他的罪狀。梅逆於審判長點喚聲中入被吿攔，問過姓名年齡籍貫後，梅逆突對法警在提審時，用繩索捆綁提出抗議，當被庭上駁斥。</p>
<p>密談和平竟稱奉命</p>
<p>檢察官起讀起訴書後，審判長即詢梅是否黨員，曾任何職及參加和運經過。梅答稱是黨員，曾任中央政治大學政治系主任，至於由港到滬與敵影佐禎昭秘密談和平方案一節，竟稱係奉命。審判長當即詢其奉何人之命，答曰在精衛。其時任副總裁，爲駐港特派員，與高宗武同時奉命赴滬活動。這時審判長正言厲色引蔣主席所說的「和平未到最後關頭，決不放棄和平，犧牲未至最後關頭，決不輕言犧牲」，「一經抗戰，決不中途言和，妥協就是亡國滅種」，梅逆半響無答，最後始稱國策表面看簡單，實在很複雜，參預政治的人，往往會錯誤，並妄選詭辯，調當時實誤會汪之「和運」受命於中央，日人亦有如此誤曾，故對「和運」十分熱烈。但後來梅逆又公然承認「和平」是他的主張，並陳述彼在僞任內如何如何帮助後方抗戰，供詞前後矛盾，顯見漢奸吹虛狡賴。審判長又問承認僞滿，雅片公賣，供敵軍糧等事，梅皆一律狡賴，所有責任成推於死者汪精衛身上。</p>
<p>呈自辯書內分六點</p>
<p>最後庭上詢財產及家屬，梅答向不置產，家屬有一妻五子二女。梅逆著有「和平運動始末記」一册，及自撰之辯訴書呈庭上審訊。至十一時開始辯論，梅自辯六點：（一）與高宗武赴日係奉汪命。（二）與影佐談判並無結果。（三）僞政委會由主席指派，一切事皆由汪獨裁，本人雖爲委員，不能左右政局。（四）在僞府任職五年，未做一件違抗本國之事。（五）組織僞政府，乃緩兵之計，而確信在蔣主席領導下，抗戰必勝。（六）濫發僞幣，非我職權內事。梅辯舉，繼由公役辯護人劉賢才辯稱，被吿在僞任時曾吸收物資，保存勢力，减少統制，和恢復淪陷區工業。勝利後並不逃避，向接收人員辦理移交，請求庭上公正裁判。十一時三刻　論終結，庭諭本月九日上午十時宣判，被吿還押。</p>
<p>褚女代母呈文高院</p>
<p>〔本報蘇州三日電〕褚逆民誼判處死刑，今日已届法定申請覆判期之最後一日，下午二時許記者往蘇高院採訪時，適與褚女孟媛相逢，伊身穿藍衫，持一文件向高院呈遞。記者在旁詢問，知爲其母褚陳森貞代夫申請覆判之呈文並以副本示記者。該呈內容，滿紙空言，並百般狡辯，毫無具體證據提出。略謂，被吿獻身革命偉業，追隨總理及「汪先生」未嘗有一日間離，並列舉理由三點：（一）被吿亦曾主戰，原判謂被告始終主張聯合日寇，實無所根據。至組偽府以後所發表主張言論，供係基於職務與立塲。至原判所謂勾結軸心國承認偽府，實非被吿聯絡之力，（一）被吿擔任外交虛銜日外交且不多顧問，遑論內政，（三）與，本簽訂基本條約同盟條約及協定，均由「在先生」個人簽字，被吿並未陪署。偽府雖對英美宣戰，實未派遣一兵一卒，故請廢除原判，更爲公平之判決。</p>

<p>〔合衆社北平三日電〕共產黨方面人士認爲目下東北及華北之內戰規模，不惟可與成立停戰協定前相比，且幾相等。執行總部政府代表鄭介民將軍吿記者云：由彼觀之，「東北之局勢正日趨嚴重中」。渠稱：共產軍奪取長春殊不合理，因政府事前已予以接收，但不論情勢之發展如何，吾人必須竭盡所能，覓取某種合理之解決，以防局勢之再惡化。合衆根根據過去一星期中國共雙方之消息，認爲目下至少有九個不同地段在進行軍事活動或發生激戰，（一）長春南方七十哩之四平街，（二）濟陽東南四十二哩之本溪湖，（三）山海關至錦州一段鐵路綫，（四）爲數二百人至二千人之共黨突擊隊，正不斷破壞北平與天津間之鐵路（五）北平至保定一段織路綫，大砲，迫擊砲，機槍與步槍之互轟，乃每日常事，（六）靑島至濟南一段鐵路綫，（七）蘇北地區，（八）「華中軍區」，（九）山西北部再度發生激戰。</p>
<h3>周恩來等飛抵京　即將與政府及馬帥會商</h3>
<p>〔本報南京三日電〕中共代表周恩來·鄧穎超。陸定一及廖承志。王炳南曁新華通訊社，新華日報職工六十餘人，分乘兩機，於三日晚六時及六時十分先後抵京，周鄧所乘者爲馬使之星座機，周鄧下機後即乘車至梅園新村新宅休息，對在塲訪問之中外記者未發表談話。惟陸定一曾作宣傳式之談話，調中原戰事已發生，中央已下令十一個軍廿六個師攻擊共軍，並謂，在長春被俘之美記者及中央通訊社，中央日報記者，毛澤東已有意釋放，惟方式尙在硏究中。又中共代表董必武現留渝，定下星二來京。</p>
<p>〔本報南京三日電〕蔣主席，馬歇爾特使及，中共代表周恩來，已先後抵京，惟舉世囑目之東北問題，其談判能吾於短，期重開，在各方期符中。據本報記者獲悉，在今明兩日中，馬使與蔣主席尙不及商談東北問題，因雙方現正靜待中共願否退出長春之答覆。就目前中共之行動觀察，中共可能暫時廻避東北難題，而強調所謂中原軍區之嚴重性，以便爭取一猶豫時間，熟計東北局勢之利害及其後果。果爾，則東北談判能否於下週內重開，尙在未定之天，因政府爲維護國家主權，必須接收長春，已具決心也。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京三日電〕中共代表周恩來對詢問關於「中原區」戰事及東北局勢等問題，避免作具體答覆，僅稱：抵京後，即將與政府及馬帥繼續商談。另悉：靑年黨代表團將於四日來京。</p>

<h3>蔣主席在京接見胡佛　談中國糧食問題　胡當日返滬今飛漢城視察</h3>
<p>〔本報南京三日電〕杜魯門總統私人代表美前總統胡佛，偕糧食部長徐堪於今日上午十一時二十分，由滬乘機抵京，馬歇爾於十一時十分親臨大較塲機塲迎候胡佛，同時到塲歡迎者有交通部次長凌鴻勛等三十餘人，胡佛下機後，與歡迎人員握手問好後，旋與馬使同章運赴寗海路馬使寓邸休息。徐堪部長在機塲曾答復記者詢問，謂聯總將有大批米糧運華。</p>
<p>〔本報南京三日電〕蔣主席抵京後，今下午三時在軍校官邸，接見美前總統胡佛及馬歇爾特使，主席以胡氏此次遠涉重洋，考査遠東各國急賑需要，特別關懷我國災區善後，及常前糧食分配及運輸問題，熱心可感，曾向胡氏面致謝忱，並對目前迫切待決之糧食運輸問題，交換意見，談話的一小時餘，旋於四點二十分親至機塲歡送胡佛，胡氏專機於四點三十分啓飛赴滬。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京三日電〕美前總統現任急賑委員會主席胡佛及隨員梅柏，郭勃生，費茲格拉德今（三日）午後應外交部王部長世杰歡宴，馬歇爾元帥麥克魯將軍，柯克海軍上將，穆雷海軍上將，美大使館參事施麥斯及我軍政首長何總長應欽，陳部長誠，徐部長堪，蔣秘書長夢麟，甘次長乃光，劉次長鍇等，均應邀參加。午後三時蔣主席及夫人於官邸茶會招待胡佛及馬歇爾元帥，主席對胡氏熱心解決中國糧荒，表示謝忱，並追述一九三一年中國長江水災時，胡氏於其總統任內，曾捐募巨款，茶曾後主席及夫人復親送胡氏登機，胡氏一行四時半離京飛滬。定明日飛朝鮮漢城，後日赴東京，轉道返國。另據糧食部徐部長稱：中國糧荒嚴重，曾要求美國方面自五月起至八月止，每月運華糧食二十萬噸，並設法協助中國解決交通問題，俾糧食運抵海口後，可輸送至目前災荒嚴重地械，原則上胡氏已表示同意。</p>
<h3>救濟中國嚴重災荒　先解決運輸困難　胡佛對滬老房發表談話</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕「賑災特使」美前任總統胡佛氏，昨日下午四時半由京返滬，六時半在建設大厦八樓，舉行中外記者招待會，發表談話半小時，由美陸軍駐華總司令吉倫中將，聯總駐華署長凱撒及康納斯等陪同列席。</p>
<h3>飽受戰爭破壞　中國需糧孔亟</h3>
<p>首由胡氏宣讀書面談話，胡氏在會間始終低首視手中所備文件發話，音調沉重，謂：中國食糧需要甚大，八年來中國飽受戰爭破壞，農業萎縮及水旱災荒痛苦，目前無充分材料，以正確計算實需糧食噸數，但其數必超出運往內地之輸送量，在五月至九月之嚴重期間，必須盡量發揮各種輸送能力，每月將二十萬噸之糧食，分配至各　。</p>
<p>由於長期缺乏組織之結果，飢民人數亦無從統計，但估計人數在幾百萬，乃奄無疑問者，因災區分佈之省份極多。關於內地省份飢民死亡日增，允因無力抵抗傳染病而致死，中外當局，均有報吿，現廣大地區中整村整鄉死亡，尙未發生，但若供應品不能運達，則數星期內必能發生此種嚴重悄形。</p>
<h3>救濟中國糧荒　運輸最感困難</h3>
<p>胡氏繼答覆各記者之書面問題稱：糧荒問題，遠較兵災爲嚴重，但可吿慰者，此危　問題在本年九月一日起，即可謀解決，蓋九月爲大收成時期，世界各產糧區，均可供給糧食。</p>
<p>救濟中國災荒最感困難者，乃「運輸」問題，運輸不便，即有大量供應品，亦無濟於事。中國遭受世界上最痛苦之三災即（一）兵災，（二）旱災，（三）水災。入年來慘遭摧毀，萬哩鐵路被破壞，多處水這受阻撓，交通工其缺乏，此亦即與歐洲不同之處。歐洲各國交通困難較少，同時公共衛生亦較進步，故運輸救濟品便利，死亡率目能减少，中國如能解決運輸問題，則危險現象，即可消滅。此次馬歇爾特使返美，曾與美政府當面討論此點，已要求撥給飛機若干架，以在中國運輸糧食，在華糧荒情形，由杜魯門總統私人代表哈立遜上校負責調査，並由「聯總」與「行總」支配救濟及解決輸送商問題等，而救濟對象，絕對不以黨派，宗敎等種種關係而有區別，共產區之人民，亦一視同仁。</p>
<h3>視察世界糧荒　胡氏任務有三</h3>
<p>胡氏報吿此次視察歐亞各國任務有三：（一）調査各國飢荒情形並決定何國需要糧食救濟最多。（二）商討運用有剩餘物資國家之物資，（三）返國向杜魯門總統作詳細實情報吿。胡氏謂此次與其同來者有糧食專家六人，其中五人在第一次大戰時，即與其共同辦理糧食救濟，富有經騐。有記者詢以政治問題，胡氏聲明此來除全爲糧食外，絕無其他任務，不願談及政治問題。在南京時與馬歇爾元帥所談亦不願發表，同時對於救濟中國情形之各種占批評亦非本人任務範圍內事。胡氏特加重語氣謂：「艱苦問題常在前面而非背後，吾等應設法建設未來。」</p>
<p>胡氏並報吿目前全世界災民約有八萬萬餘人，包括歐洲三萬萬二千五百萬人，印度洋方面二萬萬二千萬人，太平洋三萬萬人，調査個人每日食量，按卡作單位，有二千二百卡者，有一千八百卡或一千二百五十卡者，最低者僅一千卡。以第一次世界大戰時之糧荒，與此次比較，胡氏稱第一次大戰破壞農田較少，故較易恢復原狀，供應品得以生產接濟，而此次則頗有不同。</p>
<p>胡氏表示美當局決儘量收取剩餘物資，以救濟各國，美國人民本身即竭力减少及節省食糧，以供給災民。現加拿大，阿根廷及暹羅等地，均有剩餘糧食，暹羅方面雖存有相當數量之米，但亦限於交通困難，無法運舉，現正設法修路造橋，改善交通。</p>
<h3>希望中國統一挽救無數生命</h3>
<p>胡氏最後對於中國·美國各有關當局，敎會團體，紅十字會及各自願服務機關等合作精神，表示欽佩及感謝，繼希望中國全體人民，今後能合作統一，即可挽救無數生命。</p>
<p>胡氏定今晨飛朝鮮漢城視察，再赴日本，然後返華盛頓，晋謁杜總統述職。</p>
<h3>最近返滬一將領談　東北局勢待澄清　望共軍以國家為重誠意合作　千餘學生投軍已編成獨立營</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕記者頃謁新於一週前自東北飛滬之國軍某高級將領，承吿，目前國軍在東北所能控制之區域，事實上可以瀋陽四平街，營口，撫順四地爲其範疇。共軍之運往東北者，陸路係由蘇北徒步至熱河，冒雪沿北寗路前進，因多數均係被迫，故怨聲載道，毫無鬥志，其自海道輸運者，係自靑島乘日本汽艇前往。彼等之裝備，亦盡係取自日俘，民衆均被成脅，作其前衛，而彼等尤慣用密集隊伍衝鋒之戰術，實則以民衆爲犧牲而已。</p>
<p>東北國軍人數，遠較共軍爲少，然而正義所在，鬥志不隳，沙嶺一役，國軍竟以二十與一之比，以二營不足之軍力，抗共軍六團之衆，結果共軍仍死傷二萬，不逞而退。考察此次共軍攻勢，其企圖實在切斷北寗綫，使整個東北陷於彼手，然我軍早洞燭其隱，確切把握鐵路，共軍雖屢次破壞，我軍終能於短時期內即行修復，故共軍初衷，已成泡影。</p>
<p>東北民衆，竭誠擁護政府，國軍到處，其歡迎之熱烈，允令人感奮。有耆宿多人，向國軍將士列陳其經歷之慘，竟至老淚滂沱，聞者爲之慘戚。東北靑年學生，頗多入關投軍者，目前在錦州，北平二處集合者，已逾千人，已於其中　成一獨立營，列入靑年軍。</p>
<p>共軍人數雖多，究係　合之家，故砲手等職務，多仍由日俘充任，我軍皆百戰雄師，若以實力而言，實無問題，若共軍果不能遵守政治協商會議之決議，而欲一意孤行者，則國軍自祗有强迫接收之一途，届時摧枯拉朽，指顧間事。惟馬歇爾至京後，國共問題，當必可謀解決之方，深盼誠意合作，以國家爲重。中國實已不能再戰，八年來人民妻離子散，目前勝利已臨，而人民妻離子散如故，痛心曷極，此則深望共軍能痛改前非幡然悔悟者也。</p>
<p>至共軍造謠謂國軍中有美籍顧問一事，該發言人予以絕對否認，謂：「目前東北國軍之中，絕無美國人在內」。　該發言人承認國軍之運輸與補給，現尙甚少進步，鐵路因時遭破壞，海運尤甚少把握，故東北局勢之澄淸，恐尙須相當之時日也。</p>

<h3>發揚五四精神！</h3>
<p>二十七年前的今天，北平掀起波及全國的學生運動，是中國民族自覺的表現；這就是轟轟烈烈的五四運動。在中國民族解放運動的歷史上，五四運動實具有劃時代的意義。當年參加這運動的人，如今多已成爲中國社會各方面的中堅。回憶二十七年前今日所掀起的蓬勃運動，當茲抗戰勝利，山河重光，國家步入建國階段的今日，緬懷往事，誠不免感觸多端。事隔二十七年，當時的熱烈情緒雖已隨時間的變異而變異，但靑年朋友今天來紀念「五四」，仍有繼續發揚「五四」精神的必要。</p>
<p>所謂「五四運動」，這在中國當代史上原具有政治與文化兩方面的意義。從政治方面言，亦有對外與對內的兩面。自對外方面言之，這是中國民族運動最早而具體的表現，也是中國靑年擁護國權運動的嚆矢。甲午戰爭以後，民族意識本已在若干中國人民中滋長，到了日俄戰爭以後，日本對我加緊侵略，愈演愈兇，於是中國的民族運動幾與抗日意識不能分隔。當第次世界大戰時，日本乘列强有事於西歐，對我侵略更形加緊，提出所謂二十一條件，欲將整個中國淪爲日本的附庸，當時的執政者不顧民族利益，多方獻媚日本，於是激動公憤，北平學生舉行罷課遊行，打毀「賣國賊」曹汝霖，陸宗輿，及章宗祥等住宅，一時各地響應，波及全國。五四運動，從其對外的政治意義言，實是中國民族運動最初而具體的表現，由於這一運動，中國的和會代表終於拒簽巴黎和約；亦由於這一運動，卒有華盛頓會議的召開而山東復歸中國。故五四運動在對外的政治意義上，是相當的成功的。中國反抗日本的侵略，自五四運動以來，經過北伐時代的五三慘案，九一八後的長城之戰，淞滬之戰，一直到七七事變後的今日，纔因抗戰的勝利結束而究遂其使命。自其對內的政治意義方面言，五四運動是爭取民主的一種運動。隨着辛亥革命而建立的中華民國，因軍閥及封建餘孽的竊據，政治窳敗，人權不保，爲打擊當時腐敗的官僚主義，發揚革命的精神，故對於賣國求榮的官僚如曹汝霖等予以打擊。這實是繼承辛亥革命的精神爲爭取民主的一種革命運勁。</p>
<p>作爲一種政治運動的五四運動，外則爲確保民族的生存而有抗日的示威，內則爲謀政治的革新而有民權的爭取；其特徵爲民族主義與「德謨克拉西」—民權或（民主）主義。論其性質，這一運動的意義，多少與於維也納會議後一八四〇年代出現在德國及歐陸之學生運動相似。當時的北平，爲我國高等敎育的中心，此一運動的掀起，是否直接或閒接受了十九世紀出現在歐陸的學生運動的影響，我們無從測知，但就其發展形態及意義言，五四運動在此方面，實多少相同於十九世紀出現在歐陸的學生運動。從中國政治方面言，五四運動以後，中國政治的演變，纔轉向一條新路，這就是民衆的爭取。在這以前，革命黨人或則從事於權要的暗殺，或則從事於軍隊的煽動，往往未能注意到民衆運動的力量。五四運動爲中國政治開了一條爭取民衆的新途徑。此後中國國民黨的改組以及中國共產黨的產生，都直接間接受了五四運動的影響。由於五四運動掀起了蓬勃的民族主義，中國的國民革命也就加入了一股新的力量。運用了這股新的力量，國民革命便積極的順利展開，終至打倒軍閥，完成統一。</p>
<p>然而五四運動在政治方面的意義似不及它在文化方面的意義。五四運動的本身雖則是一種政治運動，但由於這一運動的掀起而引起的思想解放，在文化方面郤起了重大作用。在文化的領域內，當然最爲人所熟知的便是所謂新文化運動和白話文學的建立。方言入文本是「古已有之」的，五四運動以後，因爲有新文藝的提倡，增廣了白話入文的使用範圍。今天我們用白話來寫文章，這在五四運動以前的人看來，特別是那些古文家，怕要說是對中國文字的一種侮辱。可是在今天，除掉頭固的守舊者以外，白話文學已是一般的標準。五四運動在文化方面所起的建設作用，怕就祇此一點。在這以外，它在文化方面所起的作用毋寗說多是消極的，破壞的。在「打倒孔家店」的呼號下，我國固有的傳統，我先人所留下給我們的文化遺產，動輒鄙棄。在那個時候，居然有人提倡「非孝」，提倡「公妻」，這在現在看來，誠不免充滿了幼稚病的流露，然而在那時候，郤與「共產」主義一樣很認眞的被一般「新頭腦」的新青年熱烈的研討着。從吾定固有傳統的出發點，於是對過去中國歷史的紀錄也發生了懷疑，特別是古史方面。懷疑風氣演變到後來的結果，便是一切傳統價値的破產。旣可提倡「非孝」，便可提倡不忠，不貞，乃至不法；至是，我國固有的行爲規律便失去其規律性，道德標準不復稱道，而社會的紀綱也搖搖欲墜了！</p>
<p>解放了我國固有思想傳統的桎枯，五四以後，中國思想方面郤受了兩種外來思潮的支配，直到如今，中國思想界還不能從這兩種思潮完全解放出來。第一是所謂實騐主義及淺薄的自由主義；其二就是馬克斯主義及其附屬的意識總和。五四運動以後，美國哥侖比亞大學的杜威敎授，一時彷彿替代了「萬世師表」的孔夫子，稍後又來了英國的羅素。在打倒了孔家店以後，杜威和羅素彷彿一個變成了「至聖」，一個變成了「亞聖」。這一股思潮，事隔二十多年，到如今還爲人所津津樂道。這是由於中國的讀書人二十多年來，固然解脫了孔家店的桎梏，却又加上了西洋學說皮毛的桎梏。他們不曾看見西洋文化的全貌，却固執在假冒知識的偏見。其自詡前進的份子，衝破了這種偏見，却又加上另一桎梏而不知自拔，這就是馬克斯主義的桎梏。由馬克斯，恩格斯，列寗乃至蒲力漢諾夫等等，說他們的思想就可以代表絕對眞理，萬世不移，其誰能信？然而中國的「文人」「學者」或「賢達」「名流」，因爲好時髦，直到如今，對馬列主義也似乎津津有味。談政治經濟固然要用馬列主義，甚至談歷史文化也要用馬列主義，硬說中國的某一時代是某種社會。此在學術思想界方面，雖爲識者所不齒，認爲彷彿是刻舟求劍之徒，然亦足見馬列主義這一桎梏的遺毒之深。</p>
<p>今天我們在紀念五四運動，應該有所惕勵。二十多年來，我們的思想界不能從淺薄的偏見中解放出來，這是我們的恥辱。當年五四運動所引起的後果是打倒了我們的傳統偶象，破壞原是建設的必要手段，但我們不能祗有破壞而沒有建設。今天國家抗戰勝利，我們已完遂了當初五四運動的一個政治目標，而在文化方面，建設的工作尤應隨建國大業的展開積極推進。我們要從狹隘的偏見中解放出來，建立適合中國國情的三民主義的文化。必如此，纔能繼續發揚光大五四運動的精神。</p>

<h3>東京國際法庭開庭　日戰犯俯首受審　昨日宣讀起訴書未畢今晨再續訊　大川當庭神經錯亂連摑東條之頭</h3>
<p>〔本報東京特派員三日專電〕審訊日本二十八名主要戰犯工作，業於今晨開始。法庭設於陸軍省內，九位法官之席位，面對戰犯欄，左旁爲盟國要員旁聽席。十時許，朱世明將軍偕同第八軍軍長艾契爾勃裘將軍蒞庭旁聽。右旁分設盟國及日本記者席。盟國人士及日人之旁聽處，均在法庭二樓，法庭中央，爲國際法庭檢察官席。審訊預定於十時半開始，但甫自曼谷押解而來飛抵厚木機塲之板垣與木村兩人，尙待解赴法庭候審，致開庭時間略遲。庭方等候一小時，未見解到，被吿席上乃虛懸兩席。日戰犯六人，以木戶居先，魚貫入庭，靜坐被吿欄內。東條坐於第一排中央，其右爲土肥原，畑俊六，廣田，南次郞，左爲星野，賀屋，木戶，餘犯均坐於東條座後。盟國各檢察官，在檢察長季楠率領下就應於中。時執行吏梅德上尉宜稱：「全體肅立，法官入座。」於是在全體起立聲中，由審判長魏勃領先，各法官依次就座於九幅盟國旗幟之下。中國法官梅汝璈，坐於審判長以下之第一位，各盟國記者，目覩中國法官獲此榮譽座位。莫不紛紛耳語。記者吿彼等謂：中國在抗戰期內，喪失人民兩千萬，故在一切國際榮譽事件上，均應佔有一席。首由審判長魏勃宜佈開庭，季楠乃將各檢察官，遂一介紹與各法官，首先介紹者，爲中國檢察官向哲濬，謂：渠係中華民國上海地方法院首席檢察官。全體人士對此中國檢察官，皆予以深刻之注意，尤其引起日本各戰犯之注視。此後各譯員在梅德上尉之領導下，舉手宣繫，表示效忠之意。十一時三刻許，審判長魏勃宣佈休息，下午二時半再行開庭。</p>
<p>審判長魏勃於開庭辭中云：「歷史上罪犯之審判，從無有今日之重要者，吾人爲一平民組織之法庭，由各國最高法院選任，另一方面，各被吿則爲日本全盛時代之領袖，各被吿犯有破壞世界和平，違反戰爭慣例及違反人道三項罪名。此種彌天大罪，自惟有組織國際性之軍事法庭加以審判」。</p>
<p>下午二時三十分，繼續開庭，季楠將起訴手交各法官，復由魏勃面令梅德上尉如誦對各犯之起訴書，當譯員以日語朗誦起訴書內，日軍閥殺害中國人民之一節時，前瀋陽事變之策動人，兼主驅逐亞洲白人之鼓吹者大川周明，突高聲呌笑。大川坐於東條身後，當聞悉東條破壞國際公法，偸襲珍珠港一言時，忽以右手摑打東條之秃頂，東條僅以苦笑答之。又譯員讀至南京有成千累萬之中國平民與非武裝者悉被日人屠殺一節時，大川乃二次摑打東條之首，復喃喃禱吿，解開上衣，露出其瘦削之胸膛，此時法庭內笑聲四起，執行吏梅德上尉乃高呼「維持秩序」。大川卒被憲兵拽出法庭。至四時三刻起訴書已讀至四十七款，審判長魏勃宣佈休息，定明晨九時三十分再審。届時控訴狀可以完全讀畢，各被吿將提出辯解。</p>
<h3>戰爭要犯諸形相　瘦削的軀幹上穿着敝舊軍服　各人都好像強盜行兇後受審</h3>
<p>〔聯合社東京三日電〕世界最大謀殺案今天開審，廿六個衣衫襤褸的被吿，坐在輝煌燦爛的法庭中，他們瘦削的臉上，無力地掛着一種慍怒之色，這種神色在昔年曾經叱咤風雲，不可一世。道種神色，從前是勝利的日人之商標，現在色厲內荏，</p>
<p>強作鎮靜</p>
<p>，實是好亂的成島國武人性傳統。這輩人有時都以現代的武士自居，欲承襲從前征服的好夢。東條似乎想仿傚斯巴達的戰士，松岡洋右雖然是個愛好舒適的文官，似乎也想分任「前錢的困難」。本戶侯從前是帝國最高級的文官，穿一套極其樸素的制服，即隨侍日皇裕仁時也是如此。今天他們將受生死攸關的審判，他們走進法庭，帶着一種沮喪的神情，非慍怒所能掩飾，這種沮喪，以前曾緊扼了他們淫威下無數戰時受難者。他們穿着敝舊的軍服，披在因受牢獄之災而瘦削的軀幹上，弄得</p>
<p>怪模怪樣</p>
<p>像東條之類，無疑地將在庭上竭力自辯，以證明他們作戰的「正當」。多數被吿將圖卸責任。一部份在審判繼續進行時，或將隨之益加漠不關心，今晨短短的一庭，雖然是例行手續，也可窺見這些從前統治者的眞相將逐漸暴露了。在這輩人的前面，是一些審判他們過去行爲的人，修飾整齊，風度翩翩，圍繞他們的是穿着漂亮制服的憲兵，這些厲害的孩子們擊敗了他們富於狂想而實際不堪一擊的軍隊。在被吿席上面的旁聽席，有被吿少數親朋和日本政府的代表。足够奇怪的是東條在各個被吿中</p>
<p>最不自在</p>
<p>，這個自殺手段太拙劣的人，沉下了臉坐着，面前放着一只文件包，其中大的就是他的「自辯書吧」。東條又帶起他那副玳瑁邊眼鏡，活像他在戰時的照片。木戶的神色，恰像一個因惡作劇而被捕的頑童，開庭時始終維持這種樣子，在他架眼鏡的臉上曲曲的浮着一種慍怒之色。他在全部被吿中，或者是最矮小的一個，幾乎不能望過面前的　杆，一度在外務省聲威逼人的松岡，和一度爲軍閥系主要角色的南次卹，兩人因久居獄中，</p>
<p>于思滿頰</p>
<p>，殊不雅觀。各被吿中，大概只有松岡一個人能聽懂英語陳述，其他各人必須等待那慢吞吞的翻譯手續。另一部份要犯，好像强盜行兇後受審。島田大將左下頰有個　痕，齋藤大將坐在他的旁邊，凝目而視，像　個戒律森嚴的守敎者，身上穿着　腫的軍服。前首相小磯骨都着嘴，態度傲岸。在審訊謀殺案件的被吿席中，大的從來沒有見過這種對照的吧。</p>
<h3>花花絮絮</h3>
<p>法庭旁聽席目淸最起即已坐無隙地，其中大多數爲日本人，日本前外相松岡洋右之一子一女，亦雜在其中。</p>
<p>到塲旁聽者，均經美憲兵抄査身畔，但並朱發現何種違禁品</p>
<p>聯合國戰爭罪行委員會主席萊特，亦出席旁聽。萊氏以前任英格蘭高等法院法官，此次來日係應麥帥之請。</p>
<p>各犯多衣便服，僅橋本欣五郞一人穿本屐。各犯昔曾指揮萬入，今則全無戲風。各犯出庭第一日，備有優美午餐，以快朶願，菜　中開有紅燒牛肉片，牛肉瓶，爛糊　薯，白塔靑豆，麵包，白塔油及咖啡</p>
<p>曾任松岡外相秘書之長谷川預言，松岡所受待遇，若無改變，則不待審訊終結，即將斃命。</p>
<p>當宣讀起訴書時，各被吿聲色不動。重光葵頻頻搖首，似表不滿。年邁之松岡洋右，則竟昏昏睡去。</p>

<p>〔聯合社巴黎三日電〕據出席四國外長會議主要代表今日表示意見，若無意外發展，此次會議對任何和約，均少商獲妥洽之希望。英美法三國官員私下聲稱：今若預料會議將吿決裂，全歸失敗，固然過早，惟四國外長商談已歷一週，似對任何一項爭執問題，均未獲得進展。或謂美國務卿昨日要求修改對義大利等國休戰書，表示在短期內商妥和的之希望，已迅趨淡薄。</p>

<p>〔合衆社巴黎二日電〕美國務卿貝爾納斯今日要求盟國修改軸心附庸各國之和的條款，並警吿蘇聯謂：美國無意撥款救濟戰敗國家，故蘇聯可自戰敗各國取得賠償。貝氏提出此項警吿時，美蘇英法四外長正討論對義和約，蘇外長莫洛托夫謂：蘇聯必須獲得賠款兩萬萬元，其他乙萬萬元歸諸南斯拉夫與希臘。貝爾納斯於會議全成僵局時，乃提此有關修改和的條件之建議。</p>

<p>〔路透社耶路撒冷三日電〕阿刺伯高級委員會，昨經五小時之會議，研究巴勒斯坦之英美調查報吿書後，已任命一緊急小組委會，以草擬不服從計劃，動員阿刺伯靑年與資源，爲國效命。該小組會將在全巴勒斯坦組織民衆集會，募集阿刺伯民族基金，以推行阿刺伯民族運動。阿刺伯高級委員會已以抗議函件電達英相艾德禮，幷將派阿刺伯代表團至亞丁及各阿刺伯鄰邦從事活動。</p>

<h3>漏綱之魚　喜多寺內閑院宮等　最後諒難逍遙法外</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓二日電〕日本戰爭機構之軍事的大輪齒與政治的緩衝物，現以戰犯被控矣。首次起訴狀範圍雖僅及其外層，但聯合國檢察長季楠曾聲明，被吿名單所未見者，並非此後即可逍遙法外之謂，由此可見遠東國際法庭正圖按步就班，循序漸進，不欲在第一案審訊時牽涉過廣。就現在形勢觀之，此案範圍顯將逍溯至田中奏摺，則其牽涉之多，可想而知。此次日皇裕仁未列入二十八名被吿名單，已受注意，同時各大財閥亦無一人列入，或者留待日後追究，事屬可能。大名頂頂之土肥原，已囚發動瀋陽事變而被控，但另有大將一人曾在中國同樣作惡，尙未被檢舉，此人即喜多誠一，現已在東北被蘇軍所俘。最後一任東南亞洲日軍最高司令官寺內壽一亦尙未列入。據最近消息，寺內現為英軍所執，患病甚劇。一九四四年在中國領導最後侵略戰之岡村寗次大將，亦尙未提及。據最近消息，此人仍在中國侵華初期首相最後一任朝鮮總督阿部信行退役大將與前任參謀總長閑院宮均未列入。此外，滿洲重工業會社總裁綾川吉亮，利用財閥開發滿洲資源以供軍需，亦尙待檢舉。總之，此次漏網之魚實不勝枚舉，惟東條等旣已開審，其幕後牽綫，殘暴有過無不及，稍暇時日，諒必難逃法網也。</p>

<h3>潘公展程滄波　茶會歡迎吳鐵城　舊地重遊表示衷心愉快　昨晚晉京參與還都盛典</h3>
<p>本報指導員潘公展，新聞報指導員程滄波，邀集本市新開界人士，昨日下午四時，假西藏路青年會舉行茶會，歡迎中央黨部秘書長吳鐵城氏，到各報社負責人及來賓七十餘人。首由潘公展氏起立致簡單歡迎詞，略謂：「吳秘書長於抗戰期間，主持中央黨務，參贊政府大計，此次蒞滬，新聞界人士，必均渴欲面聆敎益，特假此機會，請吳先生予吾人以珍貴指示，諸位如對於國內政局有何問題，亦可儘量提出，吳先生定必樂於解答。」旋請吳秘書長致詞：</p>
<p>此次來滬兩國不同印象</p>
<p>吳氏於熱烈掌聲中起立，以沉重之語調，發表演詞，略稱：「本人爲上海舊公僕，今於闊別九載，重與滬上舊友相見，衷心之愉快親切，實非言語所能表達。此次來滬，有兩個不同印象，第一，爲上海雖淪陷八載，但在物資上，並未遭受破壞。第二，勝利以後，後方各地社會一切狀態，均較戰前完全改觀，而上海社會情况，與市民生活，則仍與戰前無異。幾看不出絲毫經歷八年戰爭之跡象。善後救濟總署外籍友人如僅蒞臨上海，將誤認中國所受戰爭之影響甚小。</p>
<p>繁榮上海有賴大同安定</p>
<p>上海淪陷八載，戰前一切制度與秩序，悉遭破壤，收復以後，能在極短促之時間內迅速恢復，實不能不歸功於全市市民與與論界之熱誠協助與合作。惟上海欲完全恢復戰前繁榮，或較戰前更爲繁榮，則不能單靠上海市民之努力，必須仰賴聲個大局之安定好轉。本人可吿慰於諸位者，政府已抱定決心，凡有利於和平團結統一民主之實現者，政府一切讓步，均所不惜。此外，本人感覺目前政局中有兩個矛盾之觀念，一爲民主之要求，一爲地盤之爭取。本人認爲民主與地盤兩種觀念，不能並存，欲實現民主，必須放棄軍隊，放棄地盤，反之，如一方面要求民主，一方面又肆行武力割據，攻城略地，則不但民主不能實現，即和平團結統一，亦不能實現」云云。</p>
<p>潘民提出葉逆飾罪意見</p>
<p>吳氏詞畢，全場熱烈鼓掌，旋程中行起立介紹鄭州綏靖公署秘警長謝仁釗氏報吿中原近况。末由菲律賓新中國社長方稚周，曁潘公展，程中行三氏，相繼提出詢問，發表意見。潘氏認爲：最近各地法院審訊漢奸案，被審奸逆，多當庭强詞辯白，並公開發表「自白書」，一般報紙，亦不惜篇幅，予以刋載，予奸逆以掩飾罪責之便利，殊屬不合，而有予以制止之必要。吳氏極表同意，希望新聞界對於漢奸强辯自白之詞，記載儘量簡略。程氏主張，輿論界對於時局之演變，應負闡明眞相，以正觀聽之責，俾使野心者不能利用淆亂聽聞之手段，達到其違法作亂之目的，吳氏亦表首有。茶會於六時半始吿結束。吳秘書長此次來滬，純爲檢査身體，已於昨晚乘夜章返京，參與中區還都盛典。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕美陸軍駐華總部上海辦事處，前爲美軍士兵請求豁免徵收筵席捐，以示優待，曾與財政局雙方決定辦法，發行「免捐證」一種，分發各軍應用。實施以米，發現證上有漏簽情事，即對使用辦法，亦有重行商榷之處。如（一）每證飲食費不得超過一萬元，及（二）每證祇准附發票一紙，以示限制，而便稽核。聞美軍方面對第二項辦法，表示同意，惟稱此事應由酒菜館方面注意。至　制每證一萬元，認爲數目太小，擬請寬放，尙未獲得解決。</p>
<h3>今午續審湯淺</h3>

<h3>蕭爕棻來滬　協助審奸　律師要求准當事人晤談否則將拒絕為漢奸辯護</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕自大批漢奸押解華德路上海監獄後，附設於該處之高等法院臨時法庭，工作驟形緊張，而審理工作人員，僅庭長劉毓桂·推事曹駿·邱煥瀛·蔡晋等四人，實不够分配工作。故司法行政部已派蕭庭長　　來滬，協助審奸。該處三樓新闢之刑庭，正在積極佈置。</p>
<p>又高院臨時庭自審理漢奸案以來，辯護律師俱以在開庭之前不能與當事人晤談爲苦。故最近特呈文高院，請予變通辦法。其理由爲除上海外，其他各地法院均無此種規定，刑事訴訟法亦明文規定被吿與律師有接見權。而懲治漢奸條理及處理漢奸條理中，亦無禁止晤談之規定。法院旣允漢奸有權延請律師辯護，自當讓律師有收集有利證據之方便云。據一部份律師稱：如不廢止此種規定，以後將拒絕為漢奸辯護。</p>

<h3>慶祝國府還都　市博物館今日開放　陳列刦餘文物五之一</h3>
<p>翻開上海市立博物館的組織草程，開頭第一條就闡明了他的任務，說是爲發揚我國文化，提倡科學硏究，傳佈現代知識，以適當之陳列與說明，輔助社會敎育。</p>
<p>正因爲他所負任務的隆重，該館自去年十二月間，就開始籌備了。幾經交涉，才把以前博物館被敵偽盜去的文物，追還了三分之二。現在大部份已經整理就緒，因爲限於經費和設備關係，先把追還文物的五分之一，佈置好了第一陳列室，在北四川路橫浜橋北九六一號的三樓。現在爲了慶祝國府還都起見，今天起開放展覽。</p>
<p>記者承該館藝術股主任蔣大沂先生的邀請，昨大已「先睹爲快」的瀏覽一過。第一陳列室雖只直統的一大間，陳列的東西，却已包羅了化石，石器，甲骨，銅器，銅鏡，古錢，陶器，以及唐瓷等。</p>
<p>化石方面</p>
<p>多的是在周口店（發現北京人化石的地方）發掘的各種動物化石。其中的魚化石，花紋淸晰可辨。此外還有李氏豬，德氏水牛，腫骨鹿種種化石。石器類裏搜集了許多新石器時代的石刀，石矛，石斧，石鑿，石鐮等；大多是在東南地區出土的。鏤刻了中國最早文字的龜甲和牛骨，該館也搜集了不少。</p>
<p>銅器類裏</p>
<p>更多的是精品，年代都在殷周漢時期。烹任用有鬲，鼎，甑；盥洗用的有匜，盤，奩；計時的壺；樂器裏的和，鐸，鈴；飲酒的道具有觚，爵，　；兵器中有戈，矛，劍，　；其中最名貴的要算淸代金石家吳大澂所收藏的一部銅器，尤其是他在寳雞所得到的城虢仲簋，是他認爲生平第一快事。還有斯基泰小銅鹿一對，斯基泰是指黑海北方草原及鹽海附近或亞細亞北部中部之古地域，是硏究靑銅器文化的重要材料。此外，泉幣的搜集，包括了銅貝，齊刀，布，及普通的銅錢。銅鏡的收藏，自戰國直至明淸，應該說得上是豐富了。</p>
<p>殉葬陶俑</p>
<p>裏面有胡俑一對。雖是唐代的東西，可是隆鼻，陷目，鬍子滿鰓，洋帽洋服，背着舖蓋，提着水壺，一副來中國求生的容貌，煞其風趣。舞姬俑，侏儒俑、匐匍俑，姿態唯妙唯肖，更有達官家中的明器羣，有全副出巡時的儀仗隊，堪稱洋洋大觀。唐瓷方面，有卭崍窰和成都東門外琉璃廠所製的普通器皿，小型器皿，和玩具三種。小巧玲瓏，可供淸賞！</p>
<p>蔣先生絮絮地如數家珍的指點解釋，記者雖然化費了一個多小時瀏覽，仍不免有走馬看花的感覺。滿希望有一時機，再來欣賞這些平常不易多見的珍品。同時希望上海的市民們，在該館的開放時期中，找個機會去看一下，以廣見聞！（蒼龍）</p>
<h3>吳逆頌皋悔已無及　當初一念之差　至今痛心萬分　詳供附逆經過</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕當陳逆公博任偽上海市長時，其秘書長吳逆頌皋，是上海的「紅人」，後來他升任偽司法行政部部長，曾來上海視察提籃橋上海監獄，威風十足，可是昨日他却以囚徒的姿態，在二百餘旁聽者的注視中，低首步入法庭。他身穿藍布長衫，脚登發光黑皮鞋，戴一副黑邊眼鏡，臉色頗爲紅潤，新薙的頭髮已花白。態度却非常鎭靜。他對於夏檢察官所提起訴書中各點罪行，一一自白不諱，惟對於「甘心附逆」一語，絕口否認。他說：「當初一念之差，至今仍覺萬分痛心。太平洋戰爭發生那年，我猶在美，本來預備和郭部長泰祺同回陪都，適逢監察院程秘書長中行堅邀赴港接任星島日報總編輯職務，二月後，</p>
<p>香港淪陷逃到九龍</p>
<p>和林康侯等住在一個旅館裏，卒被日軍捉住；關了三個月，才分三批解到上海。上海雖有家，可是經濟拮据，自己又是個百無一用的書生，做不來生意，去不得內地。爲了交涉被敵人强佔的房產，到南京去了一次，被僞組織的許多朋友包圍了，回滬後便掛了個「外交部公使」的空名。總之我當初爲了朋友去香港，結果碰上這個厄述，又怪我沒有勇氣去打破惡劣的環境，解決經濟的困難，到今日，對祖國，對法官，對旁聽的新聞記者和同胞，</p>
<p>我都覺萬分的慚愧</p>
<p>，萬分的痛心。劉毓桂庭長問：「你到南京去是那些朋友包圍你？」吳初支吾不答，經審判長連聲追問，終於說：「是汪精衛，陳公博，周佛海他們。」問：「你接收租界的情形怎樣？」答：「接收租界是地方事件，如漢口的日本租界，和天津的法租界，都是由當地的市長和總領事辦理移交的。上海的情形稍微不同，是由工部局代表和當時偽市長陳公博辦理移交的。」問：「不是由偽外交部派你去接收的麼？」吳逆答時頻作苦笑。道：「不，不，我是派去視察接收情形的。」問：「你在偽上海市政府第一區公署署長任內做些什麼事？」答：「重要工作有二種，即編制的統一與工資的統一。」問：「在僞市政府秘書長任內呢？」答：「接收租界後，上海市政仍就原來租界的政區</p>
<p>分為一八兩區</p>
<p>我做了秘書長，就爲的是設計怎樣把一八兩區合拼起來，並且予以實施」。問：「後來又怎樣做僞司法行政部長呢？」答：「民國三十四年一月，周佛海長偽上海市，要我祖任司法行政部，迫於他的堅邀，遂答應了下來。在職僅二月，不過曾與日本大使館交涉，在三月底，把拘禁在鎭江·無錫等地的中央工作人員釋放達二百八十餘人。」問：「在僞司法行政部長任內有吾參訂新法令？」答：「沒有，特別法庭是直屬偽國民政府，不轄於我，我所用的，都是中華民國的法令。」至此，夏檢察官起立宣稱，吳逆亦曾任僞物資統制審議委員會委員，且曾在偽市府秘書長任內，發表「願以決死之心，求共榮之實現」及高呼「大東亞」，「打倒英美」等荒謬言論。即以當時</p>
<p>爲新中國日報</p>
<p>等作證。吳逆閱報，　眉緊皺，臉色陰沉，僅輕聲說：「這祇是官八股罷了！」被吿辯護人何孝元律師，由吳逆之姊延聘，當庭呈上於被吿有利證件數紙，審判長即令改期再訊。被吿要求與辯護人和家屬談話，即准其在司法警察室晤談。因新聞記者羣集四周，吳逆遂以英語談話，稱彼之案件僅爲政治問題，而非人格問題。其罪行應由人民來判斷，法官不能以當時幾篇奉行的八股演講作爲他底罪證云。其子侄在旁，並不與語，吳逆僅囑其「有話星期日再說」，便在法警催促聲中還押。</p>
<p>查</p>
<p>吳逆頌皋，蘇州人，今年四十八歲，住白爾路二二一號，原任我國民政府外交部國際司司長，奉派赴日內瓦調充國際聯盟中國代表團法律專員。三十二年五月，充任僞外交部公使，兼任僞撤廢治外法權委員會委員，同年十一月，改任僞上海市第一區公署主任秘書，三十三年四月，升任僞第一區公署署長，並兼偽上海市政府秘書長，三十四年二月，復升任偽司法行政部部長，迄勝利爲止。檢察官以吳久受國恩，原應忠心報國，乃竟甘心附逆，變節求榮，靦顏事敵，實屬罪無可逭，提起公訴，請以懲治漢奸條理第二條第一項第一款論罪。</p>
<p>鄭修高判三年</p>
<p>又，偽滬西警局督察長鄭修高漢奸案，昨日下午由劉庭長宜判，主文，鄧修高，通謀敵國，岡謀反抗本國，判處徒刑三年，褫奪公權三年，全部財產，除酌留家屬必需生活費外沒收。又鄧鼎全一名，宣判無罪。此外奧奸莫格爾，惰報員劉煇齋二案，昨復提訊，仍論改期再訊。</p>
<p>張德欽今日審</p>
<p>又訊，明日上午九時，高院提訊僞浙江省財政廳長張德欽及胡澤吾，下午審問方云輝。李琪等案。</p>
<p>寶大祥店夥舞弊畏罪投浦經救起</p>
<p>金陵路寳大祥呢絨店夥計嚴永岳，近因陸緻舞弊賬款及貨物，爲數甚巨。事爲該店主査出報吿泰山分局，派探前往拘捕。詎嚴畏罪逃出，於一日下午五時許，在外白渡橋橋上投浦自殺，幸由警士査見，設法救起，嗣因査得嚴犯有使占罪，乃解送泰山分局偵査。</p>

<h3>邕賓公路發生打米車風潮　賓陽囚犯大越獄</h3>
<p>— 本報廿五日桂林航訊　特約記者梁小中寄</p>
<p>一個最恐怖的統計；「廣西的存糧只能够維持到今年四月，四月以後呢？想也不敢想。　差不多半年了，天空永遠都是一個殘酷的太陽，東西南北的農民都給太陽燒灼了心田。插秧失了時，包粟失了時，玉蜀黍，蕎麥……都失了時。平時在這僩時候，大人孩子們早已經咬着又嫩又甜的包粟米，今年却連種都沒有播。雖然有些地方，偶然也有一兩陣散一散煩惱的雨，但是連泥土都沒有濕透，有甚麽用？直到今天爲止，整個廣西都是一個「旱」字。</p>
<p>望着麵粉證乾發急</p>
<p>人們咬完了草根樹皮，救濟麵粉也趕到了。一個人十二兩，還要先塡明表册，送交分署看過，再發下來。發麵粉的時候，不知道多少個壞東西把秤尾擺來擺去，希圖揩油，給飢民揍了一頓。領麵粉時，還有一個深沉的插曲：全縣有一家（一共五個人）領到了麵粉證，却都已經餓到沒有氣力起床，到村公所去領。大家都光望着麵粉證乾發急，最後還是他們家裏的媳婦剛從母家吃了一頓飯回來，才拿起麵粉證去把麵粉領了。還有一個不算嚴重也算値得一提的插曲，就是生長在南方的農民吃不慣麵粉，桂南一帶的災民領到了麵粉，許多人不知道如何是好，結果是和了一點水，放在鍋裏煎一煎，便一塊塊的吞了。有得吃已經够快活，不曉得甚麼味道？</p>
<p>邕賓公路上搶米車</p>
<p>黃主席從二中全會回來，看了這麽一幕慘象，的確也有無限焦慮。請款請不到，借錢借不來，除了光倚賴救濟分署以外，簡直是一籌莫展。所幸同胞畢竟是同胞，大家還存無限手足之愛，各地紛紛發起了救災運動。捐款，捐米，義演，義賽，總共也凑到了幾百萬塊錢。說起來，下過只是一滴水。但是這一滴水，却是多麽甜啊！一方面是嚴禁運糧出口，（省府曾請英方准暹米二萬包，自港粵運桂，未獲結果，而大批的米糧，反而在武裝的包庇下，一批一批地由軍車運出了梧州）。曾經有商車兩架，在保安司令部的名義下，企岡運米四千斤出口，結果在邕賓公路上給飢民們搶了一光。蘇州飢民打米店，廣西的飢民打米車，無獨有偶，黑影重重。下面再吿訴你一個不是笑話的笑話：</p>
<p>禁酒令撲空稅要緊</p>
<p>禁酒令十萬火急地由省政府頒到各地，禁得不澈底的時候，輿論駡，參議員駡，小百姓也駡：不要拿米糧去糟撻！能够眞的禁得淸，據統計全省的糧食可以節省下十分之一强。這樣，最少還能多支持半個多月。然而，可惜的是事實上却被弄了一次抽脚跟的把戲，貨物稅局也十萬火急地「請示」了財政部，酒稅要緊！一大筆的收入，那裏這樣容易給弄掉？酒不能禁！酒不能禁！結果封起來的熬酒器具，一齊重見天日，杜康遺民，皆大歡喜，收錢的面有得色，雖然也曾規定「米麥等物不准釀酒」之類的具文，這才是活見鬼，騙騙小孩子！執行命令的受了重重的掣肘，奈之如何？</p>
<p>為了要活命賣靈肉</p>
<p>酒色二字，本來到處分不掉，割不斷，可憐的只是一個「色」字裏面，却不知逍包含着多少的血淚！災區裏的女同胞，從十四歲的小姑娘以至三四十歲的婦女，爲了飢餓的壓迫，爲了父母子女已身的生命，成千累百的從鄕村流浪到街頭，含着眼淚出賣着肉體和靈魂。興安全縣一帶，十斤米可以「眞個銷魂」，十斤粟也可以縱情淫慾，能够帶回家裏養得起的，便是你的老婆。拿了錢，拿了米，她們還會千恩萬謝，拿回家去救老救小的命，至於投身火坑，墮入靑樓的良家婦女，實在不知凡幾。據各地所謂「特察里」（妓女的集中營）的統計，每一夜都有不少的「新貨」加入，供給吸飽了血的人盡情地發洩獸慾，爭歡買笑。啊，好辛酸！還有旅館閭巷的所謂「流鶯飛燕」，亦莫不處處充斥。純樸成習的廣西，一旦變得如此，還不是個個爲了要活命？</p>
<p>替強盜可憐搶薄粥</p>
<p>報紙上曾經有過一個消息，簡直是曠古未聞，現在照錄如下：「中渡縣屬長盛村，有黃李氏，於某日晚，被盜數人破門而入，以槍威脅，令其勿聲，乃擁入廚房，飽食稀粥一頓，呼嘯而去。」强盜們苦心孤詣，却只是暗算一頓稀粥，說出來眞是還要替强盜可憐。然而，這也就足够都會裏面一食十萬金醉生夢死的人無限深省了！</p>
<p>飢餓旣然像一片燎原的野火，一縣一縣地擴大領域，於是目今的環境，也就造成無處不賊，無賊不兇的現象。前些日子，淸鄕的時期，還有點畏懼，現在簡直就是變成明目張胆，呼嘯成羣，到處都是股匪出沒的塲所，甚至三二百人，架起輕機關槍，守住公路口，一連刧去了七部汽車的大案子，也居然無人過問。無論鄉村城鎭，都莫不在風聲鶴唳裏過着日子。還有一件値得隱憂的事情，越桂邊境一帶，本來就是盜賊的逋逃藪，如今更出現了一些甚麼「人民革命軍」之類的番號，有計劃地招兵買馬，這眞是後患未已。</p>
<p>囚犯越獄案殺衛兵</p>
<p>賊一多，捉賊也特別捉得勤。一次淸鄕不够，再來一次淸鄕，結果全省的監獄沒有一處不是「高朋滿座」，不能够迅速結案，給予了這一批良秀混雜的囚犯一個絕大的苦痛。火籠一樣的牢獄裏，塞滿了人，不但睡沒有地方睡，連坐也要輪流來坐，再加上火熱的天氣，疫病流行，每天病死的不知多少，棺材都沒有，便拿爛蓆殮了，丟出去。牢獄和地獄差不了多少。結果，釀成了一次轟動全省的大越獄的暴動。賓陽縣監獄幾百個囚犯，在一個暴風雨的深夜裏，一聲狂喊，用石頭擊死了衛兵，蜂擁奪門而出，石頭子彈，滿天亂飛，結果囚犯逃個十空。獄長自己坐了牢，眞的盜魁又回到草澤裏茶毒地方了。</p>
<p>民工廿萬人築鐵路</p>
<p>一片災難聲裏，畢竟還有一個好消息，從湛江（廣州灣）經廣西貴縣而銜接黔桂路直通甘肅蘭州的南北鐵路幹綫，現在已經開始踏勘。預計在明年底便可修築竣工，這一段鐵路的修築，工程浩大，的需民工二十餘萬人。聞將用以工代賑的方式，募工修建，飢荒問題，總算又有一點解決的曙光。</p>
<p>飢荒不止糧食，政治也感到無限的空虛，執政了將近二十年的黃旭初主席，據聞也頗有倦動之意。優游林園，悠然南山，本來就比苦惱無邊的宦海快樂，但是，廣西的民衆還需要一個苦幹的領導人物，大家不會願意他遽然離去的。最近黃紹竑返桂主政的消息，也頗傳得起勁。</p>
<p>還有閙够了風潮的廣西大學，自校長陳劍修抵校後，把人事大事改組，再限期學生返校，並正式遷校桂林以後，一切都又已經回復了正常。回不了梧州胡蝶山的胡閙的孩子們，正又一批一批地來桂林報到，準備上課考試了。只待佔住在理工學院裏的駐軍一遷出之後，學校便正式上課。</p>
<p>白喉回歸熱疫病多</p>
<p>天氣失常，疾病也像插了翅膀的老虎，攫奪着無數的生命。桂林正流行着回歸熱和白喉症，其他各地的疫病，亦莫不應有盡有，想着去年那一塲可怕的霍亂，大家都又在發急了。</p>
<p>苦難重重，重重苦難，沒有人憐憫，也沒有人援手。廣西人正如屠格涅夫說的：「靈魂在寂寞裏燃燒，火燄又在寂寞裏熄滅」。（四月廿五）</p>
<p>這裏出生的嬰孩，可以不必離開雨步，就學習到整套的學校教育</p>
<h3>華西壩學界天堂</h3>
<p>— 成都二日航訊　周泱泉寄</p>
<p>如果有人要問華西壩的身價，那麼我可以先介紹這裏的人們流行着的一句話：「天堂的華西壩，人問的沙平壩，地獄的古路壩」。</p>
<p>華西壩—她眞是一處令人羨慕的地方，她處女型的躺在這恬靜的蓉城東南，在老南門和復興門之間，本身是一片平坦無丘的壩子，後面還繫着一帶錦江，呌如何能說出她的美麗動人呢</p>
<p>永遠春天</p>
<p>華西壩，她有一個特點，就是永遠是春天的。雖在嚴寒的冬季裏，還到處司看見靑葱翠碧的常綠樹何况在這樹木花草旺暢的三春大氣呢？「當你從塵囂的市　裏走進　子」的時候，很向然的會使你吐出一口鬱澀的悶氣。看那宮殿式的建築物，在叢林茂樹中隱現，雕樑畫棟，巍峨壯麗，混合着中西建築的美點，綠草如茵，百花爭艷，使你覺得這環境太美化了。</p>
<p>前壩後壩</p>
<p>華西壩，分着前壩和後壩；一切的精華，大都集聚在前壩。後壩是比較冷落荒漠。前壩從東旁門進去，第一幢大樓是華大圖書館，館內卷帙浩繁，那是千萬學子精神食糧的倉庫，五大學員生終日硏讀其中，尤其考試期間，則更形踴躍。館內第二層附設博物館，有關華西一帶的文物珍寳，搜藏豐當，尤爲中國西部首屈一指的大博物館。至於比較文化研究所及圖書影片展覽至，更為特色。再前去赫斐各院那是理學院和禮拜堂的所在地。體育館陪侍後側，那是經常集會的大會塲，凡有全體性的大會，講演會和演劇等，都在那里舉行。赫斐院的對面是華大事務所，那是華西大學的大腦，行政中樞的所在地。萬德門是金女大的辦公室和課室，金大是以明德樓爲中樞。燕大是以理學院爲中樞。至於生物樓，化學樓，敎育學院等大樓，大都是五大學合用的。齊魯在小天竺街的北面，只要穿貫一條馬路，雖分猶合，學生公社和靑年館，是學生經常社交和往還的娛樂塲所，只可惜容量太小。</p>
<p>整套教育</p>
<p>華西壩是以華西協合大學為主人，其餘金陵，金女大，齊魯和燕京四大學，均是抗戰發生後來自遠方的客卿，不久這些客人們，均將各還故鄕，金大和金女大，決定在本月中旬即將吿別歸去，於是好事的人們，担心着不久壩子裏將有孤寂之悠了，這是大學敎育的槪况。至於中學計有，華西協中，浙蓉，金中，高琦，濟川，省製革校等五六所中學，小學校有：弟維，南台，加拿大和市中心校等四所小學。幼稚敎育方面有：華大托兒所，金女大附屬托兒所，和幾處幼稚園。至於高深的學理研究院則有：金大文化硏究所，遠疆問題研究所，金大農經，園藝，經濟等硏究所。有人說：一個處生在華西壩的嬰孩，他可以不必離開一步，接受着整套的學校敎育。我們國內，實在需要更多幾處如華西壩這樣的地方呢</p>
<p>華西壩不但是學校的集中地，並且也是全國數一數二的醫院的淵藪。這裏有華大新醫院，肺病療養院，麻瘋醫院，華大口腔醫院，尤以牙科，眞是全國最負盛名的了。</p>
<p>清晨黃昏</p>
<p>在壩上每天有兩個時間最好，那就是清晨和黃昏了：當朝陽初上時，整個的壩子浸潤在萬道金光里，林間到處聽到黃鶯的歌唱，大地上一陣陣朝霧水氣上騰，眞是太和諧，太溢柔了。至於夕陽時份，雙雙情侶，在樹叢花間婆娑往還，高興時’高歌低吟，甚至翩翩起舞，他們和她們毫無拘東地置身在這大自然裏。</p>
<p>壩土十景</p>
<p>在這裏，我們更需要來介紹一些壩上十景了：</p>
<p>（一）「對牛彈琴」——那是金女大的琴室，終日琴聲琮琮，柔和幽揚，無奈緊壁鄰居奶廠的牛兒們又那能欣賞呢？</p>
<p>（二）「弓橋泛月」—每當日華高掛天心，在那幾座突屈的橋上，俯看溪中月亮的倒影，該是多麼富有詩意！</p>
<p>（三）「鐘樓魅影」—壩上的那座鐘樓，它是全壩的計時之神，如巨人似的聳立在壩上，它年年月月，日日夜夜，忠勤地報吿壩上人們的時辰。</p>
<p>（四）「玉女如梭」—那是新醫院門前的縮彩，看穿着潔自醫服的女郞，進進出出，那些都是天使下凡吧！</p>
<p>（五）「花街柳巷」—那是說校南路的情景；</p>
<p>（六）「警察站崗」—那是說女生宿舍門前「男士」們忠勤的攝影。</p>
<p>愛情湖畔</p>
<p>（七）「愛情湖畔」—每當夕陽西下，愛情湖邊，對對雙雙，席地坐談，該是最受人艷羨的了。</p>
<p>（八）「柳浪溪邊」—那是壩上最美麗的風景綫，平坦的大操塲，圍繞着溪水和垂柳，會使人們憶起西湖上的蘇堤白堤。</p>
<p>（九）「百貨商店—是說明博物館陳列品豐富的情態，使人們大有應接不暇之感。</p>
<p>（十）「南北兩極」—是說過去華大圖書館規定男女分座，不相往來的，但到如今，好比「斷橋殘雪」一樣，再也看不到「斷橋」，也更見不到「殘雪」，同樣，圖書館內男女豈但不分，甚且混坐得　緊了。</p>
<p>情殺故事</p>
<p>如果你要眞眞認識華西壩，還有兩件令人毛骨悚然的故事，還須向你述說：一件是早在八九年前，鐘樓旁的湖裏，發現了一具已被斬成八塊的死屍，那是被他的情敵用刀砍殺後投下湖裏的，但終於被採藕人所發覺。另一件却是在五六年前，有一個著名軍閥的姨太太，她愛戀了一位美貌的「男士」，每當更深人靜時，必前來與「男士」幽會，但事爲軍閥所悉，因之那位「男士」和那位姨太太都做了軍閥屠刀下的一對問命鳥了。當然，壩上的艷史，不止這兩件，只不過是比較最精釆最膾炙人口罷了。</p>
<h3>南昌點滴</h3>
<p>— 廿日航訊　江昭然</p>
<p>省府建設廳電訊股長陳本厚，收入有限。在白米每石二萬餘元，及其他生活必需品與白米「賽漲」之下，實無以維持自己和一個黃臉婆。嗣又接雙親大人書，催寄生活費，急如星火，於是像演戲一般，陳股長瘋了，瘋到了逢人便亂打亂駡的程度，由友人送入了醫院，但「心病還須心藥醫」，醫院自無法醫治其心病」。在這個悲劇發生之前不久，有劉陳氏在吃樹皮草根的生活中餓死的一個哀史。記者以爲死者已矣，此「瘋」實不可長！</p>
<h3>報社苦中苦學校難上難</h3>
<p>報社有「華光」。「民國」。「大衆」·「新商」·「力行」·「聲報」·「中國新報」·等七家，尙有「民報」·「捷報」等，正在籌備復刋中。現有各報銷數：多者約八千份，少者約三千份。據調查：某報平均每月虧本近二百萬元，報人心血，尙不在內。報社苦况，可見一斑！</p>
<p>「强迫敎育」本含有强迫學齡兒童入學受敎的意思。此間「强迫」用在繳「課桌椅費」上面，殊屬啼笑皆非。</p>
<h3>送了婆婆去迎着生佛來</h3>
<p>繼曹浩林氏主贛的王陵基氏，不但是軍事家兼政治家，同時對佛學頗有硏究，還是宗敎信徒。若說曹氏是「婆婆」，王氏便是「生佛一。「婆婆」去而「生佛」來，江西可說與善有緣。記者願爲三千萬贛民請命，在新主席王氏的管敎養衛之下，甚盼能早日臻於「人間大國」。</p>
<h3>保障浙西老百姓生命綫　向海潮挑戰</h3>
<p>— 四月廿六日湖州訊　丁東寄</p>
<p>豐饒的浙西平原，是浙江省的寳庫。「上有天堂，，下有蘇杭」，不消說，杭州是那麼好的。嘉興，嘉善，長安，硤石都是浙江省的好地方，海寗的西瓜，每年運到上海，替上海人消除煩悶的暑氣，冰淇淋雖然痛快，可是總沒有西瓜那樣淸涼爽口。浙西杭，嘉，兩屬，沿着東海的海濱，祇靠着一條隄防，這裏生活着五六百萬人民，因爲這裏一向是富裕的，納着浙江省最重的糧賦，生產魚，米，絲，綢，供給人們的消費。而今道條綿延五六百里的海塘五六百萬人民的保陣，却因爲人爲的和犬然的侵蝕，將近崩潰了。</p>
<p>金山衛的重要性</p>
<p>浙江省海塘的起點，是在和江蘇省交界處的金山衛。如果我們不是健忘的話，當會記起這是八年前敵人在此地登陸，包抄大上海的後路，因此，上海的守罩祇能退却了。沿金山衛一帶，就有些海塘傾圯了，也許是戰爭遺留下的。不過，撫今追昔，你會想起這些海塘實在和我們是息息相關。海塘在平時，是農田的保陣，在戰時却是我們的堡壘。</p>
<p>海塘綿延五六百里</p>
<p>海塘工程極爲艱巨，綿延五六百里，計分石塘，柴塘，涵洞等。石塘是最緊要的所在，海浪澎湃，冲蝕塘岸，長條約青石都會整條裂開，砌石條的灰縫如果匠人偸工减料，便容易冲開坍毀。柴堤是用竹木混合而成的，有杉木椿，有編成的柴條網，上面是土石工。浙西河流紛岐，涵洞引導着小河，流入東海。海潮漲時，海水可以倒灌進涵洞，流向小河，立在海塘上面，海風吹來，你會覺得一陣鹹味鑽入鼻孔與皮膚。一旁是碧色的大海，一旁是綠油油的稻田，但是碧色的海水一湧進稻田，稻田就枯黃了，而稻田的旁邊，還有浙西人民的廬舍房屋，生命財產呢。</p>
<p>偷工減料浩刦當前</p>
<p>海塘今春坍毀的，共計一千九百餘公尺，這是官方報吿。記者並沒有量過，比起全錢五六百華里，祇不過百分之一，但是這是海塘，不能隨便有一個缺口的。有了缺口，海水就冲進來，農民的一切就完了。春天的海水，據說要比秋天的小，所以一到秋天，秋潮陡漲，你會知道這是多麽嚴重的浩刦，海塘工程，讓當事的人偸工減料，不照施工規定去做，土工是媽虎，石工更隨便，一包水泥祇用牛袋，應發的麵粉又是欠下的七折八扣，再不然就是發霉了的麵粉。已經修好的是草草了事，好像祇用漿糊糊了一層，海水一泡，就會泡化。沒有修的，都已七歪八倒。浩刦當前，我們再不能忽視，從前砌的海塘，完全用石灰，沒有倒；現在用水泥的，却已倒了。我們要追究，追究這些工程上的弊病。當心罷：不要用在海塘上的麵粉，在都市裏出賣做麵包，同時也不要海塘上用的水泥，在替私人蓋洋房！</p>
<p>艱鉅工程急不容緩</p>
<p>海塘是各分字號，這是幾千年傳下來的。各字號的工程，有各字號的特質。記者雖不想作專門的硏究，但這樣長的海塘，現在是缺少人力，財力，和竹，木，水泥，條石等等的材料。工人還祇有一二千。至於材料，補補洞，也不够。財力更不用說，就是有，也還得提防有人從中乾沒。八個年頭沒有人修理，勝利後八個月也沒有認眞做。如果眞的坍了，你推我，我推你，還成什麼樣子？這是今天的海塘，浙西五六百萬人的生命綫！</p>

<h3>配價回復一六〇萬　金鈔均已平定　暗拆尙高銀根仍堅</h3>
<p>烚赤昨繼續平疲，中行配售價再降低至一六〇萬，中途仍感不振，惟一般心理對此配價，證之往日情形，認爲不致再低，逢低稍易回升，査晨開仍平，開後普通頭寸仍極一緊涸，恐慌氣氛迄未稍殺，自一六三萬逐漸退至一六〇萬關內，而後轉呈盤旋，中行配給同業六十餘條，銀樓十餘條，價一六〇萬，十時後曾降至一五七萬五，此後銀根漸轉平定，史行配給價迄未降低，擁資者逢賤補納，午刻回升至一六一萬左右，午後銀根經小行調濟四五億後，普　鬆動，續形微穩，結果較前收無甚榮呼，飾金十七萬三，紋銀一千七，銀元微升，暗拆午前站二角左右，最後約一角六至一角八。</p>
<p>外幣美鈔逢低吸收有人，出金者亦來套買，套頭軋攏至七一五元左右矣，晨開二二三〇元光景，中途降至二一八〇元左右，入後遂漸形改觀，稍呈活躍，盤升至晨開價左右，午後亦然，結果較校前收相彷彿，港票初時被大勢所帶小，後以匯票趨緊，最後復平，港電四四五元，羅比五四五元，均有成交，美匯掛牌仍平，指定銀行對做仍在二〇五〇元左右。</p>
<h3>紗價續跌</h3>
<p>昨日紗市績趨下游一，二十支中小型紗及十六支紗同行爭相出籠，價又降二萬至四萬，細紗雙綫尤爲不振，獨二十支金雙馬反較昨高二萬，因海鄂明日結關，粵帮爲趕船裝出關係，不得不忍痛吸進，吾則其價殊難立穩也，午時紡建照例掛牌，有二十九種紗綫，似校上期低二萬至十四萬元，以四十二支藍鳳綫貶低十四萬爲最多，然紗號及廠家承買者殊不踴躍，另有三種粗紗及七種細綫，招標承買，僅由永興紗號買去三十二支陽鶴雙股綫一種，價爲一百五十七萬元云。</p>
<p>昨日紐約美棉電訊報漲上至十六磅音，計近期美金二七·五六，遠期二七·　六七，米特林現貨二八·一四，本埠現棉交易停頓，廠家殺價，執貨者不願脫手，以致雙方談判不易接近。</p>
<h3>絲綢漸穩</h3>
<p>絲綢經連朝慘瀉，昨市似已入完局，惟人造絲昨日仍較上日短四五萬元，不過綢廠已經開工，實銷必動，且配給價與市價已不相上下，在最近不致再趨低落，昨市一二〇號天橋有光人造絲，上午開盤一百五十二萬元，收盤一百四十七萬元，廠經洋行貨未有做開，用絲做價與上日相仿，綢貨亦屹然未勁，終日無甚變化，不過交易甚覺寂寥。</p>
<h3>茶市趨尙穩</h3>
<p>紹興諸曁新炒青，自日前登塲以來，因持者心思活躍，故喊價卒比上日軋升，至於苞種及珠蘭二檔綠茶，天津及蘇州各地需要良好，人心咸帶堅化，底盤穩固，前途看緊，他若專銷印度孟買之特抽貢熙，同業方面鋻於價格相宜，故頻加青睞，聞吸收後擬待　出口云。</p>
<h3>呢羢交易冷落</h3>
<p>呢羢交易，邇來零躉均少，深色貨品雖略便宜，亦無人問津，夏令貨品，客方大半早已採辦舒　，街買方抱隨吐隨添主義，一般實地着戶，環境佳者，早已購剪製妥，普通薪水階級，莫不嫌貴而乏力購製，各地客戶都知不久將來，外貨必可源源運到，亦不願急於置辦，因此交易大有日趨淸疲之象，同業鑒於營業乏趣，大半多做下擋貨，少做高檔貨，拆息雖見减低，但尙可維特，於是放折息而保開消者有之，造成近來呢絨交易愈做愈劣之現象。</p>
<h3>煤市續趨軟化</h3>
<p>白煤到貨驟增，去化依然未見起色，市價又見軋小，昨又有馬克白煤中塊三千噸自海防運來，現卸麥根路　　興棧房，傳定償將在二十五萬元及卅萬元之間，烟煤上海現貨供求尙平，市價亦定，浦東棧單因銀根奇緊，同業拋售者湧，行情續趨軟化。</p>

<h3>公債大戶補空股票升降俱微</h3>
<p>公債昨業中大戶落手，由空翻多，市氣頓時改變，統丙晨開五二〇〇元，一後曾破五干元火關，見四九五〇元左右，迨賣氣稍止，債市大戶即乘機補空，經二三大戶活動下，午刻回升至五九〇〇元，結果較前收回好五百元，甲乙昇四百元，丁升三百元，戊種則軋漲五〇元，華股恐怖氣氛稍稍散除，低價時頗多掙扎，但情勢已告均衡，半天過程穩健居多，中途屢有短距離之進退，低價時永紗五〇五〇元，美亞四一五〇元，景福四一五元，午刻仍易回穩，結果較前收計五熱門升降均微，冷門則見下落，外股勢熊亦已好轉，盤頭雖多，結果各股除英聯回升半成強，餘均見榮不多。</p>

<h3>把心無愧的作家</h3>
<p>— 今純</p>
<p>葛德是十九世紀英國的一位大詩人和歷史小說作家，他在去世那一年，曾寫過這麽幾句話：</p>
<p>「我是當代寫作最豐富的一個作家，但我有幾件事是堪以自慰的：在我所有的作品中，我不曾寫過一個句，干涉他人的信仰；我不會寫過一篇東西，毀謗他人的主張。將來我在病榻上垂死時，不會想到從前有一篇作品，使我感到譴愧，要設法將它删去才安心。」</p>
<p>更葛德死於一八三二年九月二十一日，這是那年五月十日，他寫給歷史家陸克哈的信。</p>
<p>一個作家之被人稱爲偉大，一半固然因為他的作品，，一半也由於他的人格。作家偉大：產量豐富不容易，用筆　嚴更不容易。偉大的作家不一定是要迎逢讀者，但定要對得住讀者。寫時不僅是快意十時，寫後也要捫心無愧。</p>
<p>史葛德是今日作家的一個好榜樣。</p>
<h3>評社會史簡明教程</h3>
<p>— 平凡</p>
<p>鄭初民著　生活書店出版</p>
<p>這本書所要解答的問題就是「社會怎樣構成着？又是怎樣變革着」？作者在自序中說：「我卻是很謹慎的接受了對於這個問題的正確的答案和對於這個問題的考察方法，而一步一步展開對於社會構成過程與社會變革過程的忠實記述的。換言之，我是努力站在科學的營壘，才開始努力於社會進化歷程之科學的記述的」。這種「科學的著作」在「自前國內出版界實在還有必要」，「因為中國學術的落後，正在流行着先生們的淺薄的思索力，不但對於那各盿法的構成的理解過於艱難，而且對於一切事物一切現象希望他着眼於全體性的考察，即對於事物之必然的辯證的過程而作全體性的考察，實在已是太超過了先生們的視線及其生活要求的限界了」。</p>
<p>但是我郤以為（一）作者本人在觀察社會史的方法上是不科學的，（二）在解釋社會的構成上是機械的，（三在說明社會進化的過程上是反辯證的。現在把這三點加以略簡的說明。</p>
<p>第一，從唯物史觀者看起來，一切的社會的上層建築和一切社會的演變過程都是以物質爲基礎的，都是受經濟的力量所決定的。這是對的，這沒有人可以吾認的。但是我們覺得這種看法還不够。例如說，人的生活她築在一許多的細胞的有機作用上。這是不錯的，但是許多細胞的有機活動郤並不就是人的生活。人類的社會生活沒有經濟基礎是不可能的，但是徒有經濟基礎也是不可記的。似使只有幾塊基石而不造一建築、這不成其爲建築。似使只有經濟力而沒有其他的力量，這也不成其爲社會。似使我們要根據「全體性的考察」，雖然我們承認物質是精神的必需條件，但是我們決不能用解釋物質的方法去解釋精神現象。科學方法最大的前提就是要建築在客觀的事實上。假使在客觀的事實上，物質和精神有不同的內在關係和不同的性質（雖然兩者之間有發生上的關係和休戚相關的有機性），那末我們就不能把它們混爲一談。我們應該找出兩方面的特點，然後運用配合這種「客觀事實的方法去觀察它，分析它，和解釋它。似使我們祇憑主觀的信仰，拿同一把鑰匙去開各種不同的鎖」，這些門是永遠開不了的。</p>
<p>第二，說到社會的構成，誠如作者所說，除了經濟基礎之外還有政治和意識型態兩個因素，其實他還忘了兩個因素，一個是使個人之間發生講通的救育力量，一個是由文藝所表達出來的社會情緒。我以爲唯物史觀的人對於生活的情緒方面並沒有和生活的其他方面平等的重視。他們以爲人類的生活是完全要根據理智的判斷。其實情緒又何嘗不是同等重要的生活的一方面呢？還有一點是我認爲作者沒有明確解釋的，就是經濟政治和意識型態三者之間的關係，它們各自有其特殊的使命，這決非祇用「生產」「勞動」等等字眼所能解說明白的。我以爲經濟是社會生活的物質基礎，政治是社會生活的組織力量，意識型態是社會生活的計劃機構利控制機構。作者在這方面似乎還認識不足。</p>
<p>第三，在社會的演進方面，作者以爲各個階段的不同完全是因爲經濟結構，再由經濟的結構的不同而有不同的上層建築。但是社會的變革有時是意識型態方面發生了變化，然後根據這個意識型態去變革社會的物質方面。這樣例子很多。例如蘇聯的革命是先有了馬克斯的唯物史觀。中國的革命是以孫中山先生的三民一主義爲根據。到現在爲止，還是被有三民主義的理想而沒有完全實現三民主義的社會。再說到中國的社會改革，我們的思想受到西方文化的影響，深對現狀不滿，然後我們才逐步的改良，甚至於採取革命的方式。這就是所謂「得風氣之先」，所謂「先知先覺」。還有在各個階段上我們以爲各有其不同的特點，而這些特點並不能完全用「唯物」兩個字所能包括的。</p>
<p>全書內容「簡明」尙可當之無愧。詳細的批評留到以後再寫。</p>

<h3>偶閱初小國語常識課本第一冊</h3>
<p>— 黃一德</p>
<p>我的小女，今年在小學一年級續書。我對於子女的功課，相當注意，每天晚上，都要他們報吿一天的所學，尤其是在一年級的小女身上，對於生字的讀音，解釋，寫法，很費一點工天。</p>
<p>小女所讀的，是初級小學國語常識課本第一册，是敎育部審定的標準課本。昨天晚上，從頭至尾，詳細看了一遍，覺得有許多地方，還値得討論。現在把我的意見，寫在下面，以求正於高明。因爲這是小學生的正式課本，我們不妨來看得鄭重一點。</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>第一課的課文是：「來來來來上學」</p>
<p>第三課的課文是：「去去去大家去遊戲　遊戲眞有趣」</p>
<p>我以爲這兩課的語氣，與小朋友的實際生活情形，不大符合。小朋友的上學，是被動的，小朋友的遊戲，却多是自動的。從家庭出發到學校，這明明是「去」，而且課文下面的圖畫，畫着三個小朋友，走向學校去的樣子。假使改畫一幅岡，成爲校門口站着幾個小朋友，招呼上學來的小同學，這就比較的妥當了。所以我的意思，第一課的課文，不如改爲「去去去，去上學。」並且第三課第六面，還有「我要天天上學去」這一句，這樣一改，不是前後語氣相聯了嗎？</p>
<p>小朋友在遊戲的時候，往往歡喜招呼同伴，所以第三課的課文，我以爲不如改爲「來來來，大家來遊戲，遊戲眞有趣。」「大家去遊戲」的語氣，好像已有遊戲的動機，還沒有參加遊戲的樣子，可是課文下面的圖畫，早表示在很有趣的遊戲了，似乎犯了「文不對圖」的毛病。</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>第四課的課文是：「新書上有國旗靑天白日滿地紅　國旗眞美麗」</p>
<p>編渚用「新書」二字，意思一是在複習這兩個生字，我以爲不大妥當：小朋友看到國旗的機會非常多，小朋友讀到這一課的時候，或許正是「九月三日」的勝利紀念日，那末大街上，學校裏，儘有眞正的靑天白日滿地紅的美麗的國旗可以看到，爲什麽要把「國旗」放在「新書上」呢？而且課文下面的岡，完全是一幅黑白晝，並沒有「靑紅」的彩色，那末敎小朋友看圖讀文，「國旗眞美麗」這句話從何說起呢！</p>
<p>所以我的意思，把「新書上，有國旗」這兩句，又有三種改法；爲依照「編輯要旨」第五項所說的「本書敎材排列注意時令環境，以便敎學」起見，本課如在勝利紀念節敎學，不如改爲「大街上，掛國旗」。多上「街掛」二個生字，也無大碍。</p>
<p>如把本課及第五課移到在第十課左右，則可改爲「國慶日，掛國旗」。</p>
<p>第五課的課文是：「國旗國旗，我愛你，我敬你，我對你敬禮。」下面的圖，是升國旗的樣子。第五課的圖文，我很滿意，爲避免多用生字，爲與第五課的圖畫文字聯絡配合起見，我以爲還不如改爲「學校裏，升國旗」，比較最爲適合，不知編者以爲何如？</p>
<p>三</p>
<p>小女現在已讀到第十二課，課文是：「爸爸餵小鴨，小鴨長大了，賣了鴨，買小羊，爸爸　小羊，小羊長大了，賣了羊，買小牛，爸爸　小牛，小牛長大了，敎他學耕出。」</p>
<p>低級課文，應該簡單明白，使小朋友讀起來，能够朗朗上口爲原則。這課文，就違背了這原則。小女在行，在北浙江路審美女子中學小學部一年級，成績小好，教育呌他做副級長，此次還考，國常的平均分數，在九十分以上，也可算得一個優等生了，可是對着這課文，不但纏不淸楚，而且不感興趣，說是「這課書縴絲攀籐」。</p>
<p>事實上，鴨換羊，羊換牛，可能不可能，且不說他，說一句笑話，這位爸爸，本來有一雙耕田的牛，倒是還好，吾則，從小鴨換到小牛，再把小牛餵成大牛一，然後方得呌牛去耕田，那位爸一爸的田，不是早荒了嗎？</p>
<p>四</p>
<p>第二十八四十七面是：「雪花飛，飛滿天，姐姐說他好像糖，哥哥說他好像鹽，小弟弟，嘗一嘗，不甜也不鹹。」</p>
<p>同課四十八面是：「一片一片，又一片，兩片三片，四五片，六片七片八九片，飛到水面都不見。」</p>
<p>這一面課文，照文字的深淺和閱讀的興趣講，我以爲四十七面應該和四十八面交換一個地位。雖然一樣講雪，但四十八面是一個雪的謎語，先敎兒童猜雪的謎，然後再讀四十七面雪的文，在兒童閱讀有興趣得多，在敎學順序上也便利得多呢！</p>
<p>五</p>
<p>他如十七課的勉强充篇幅，二十課的不合「時令環境」，不再贅述。</p>
<p>不過我要聲明一聲：我並不是吹毛求疵，因爲道是供全國兒童閱讀的標準讀本，大家發表意見，是希望再版時能够更完善一點。</p>
<p>本欄歡迎文化界及出版界投寄「作家動態」及出版界消息短稿。</p>

<h3>Millions of Citizens Infinitely Excited; Chairman and Madame Triumphant Return to the Capital; Inspection of the City and Instructions on Municipal Administration</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Nanjing, 3rd] Chairman Chiang, accompanied by Madame Chiang, arrived in Nanjing at 11:17 AM on the morning of the 3rd aboard the "Meiling" special plane. Director of the Bureau of Military Affairs Yu Jishi and Chief of the Guards Li Tiehan accompanied them. The plane landed at Ming Palace Airport. The first to arrive to make arrangements were only Zhou Zhirou, Director of the Aviation Committee, and Sun Tonggang, Commander of the Air Force Nanjing District. This was because the National Government had received a telegram from Director Yu of the Bureau of Military Affairs on the morning of the 3rd, saying that it was instructed that heads of various agencies and news reporters need not go to the airport to greet them, so as to avoid wasting time and delaying official business. However, before the Chairman's special plane arrived in Nanjing, Commander-in-Chief He Yingqin, Vice President of the Examination Yuan Zhou Zhongyue, and Minister of Personnel Jia Jingde had all arrived at the airport to greet them. Later, it was heard that special plane No. 273, carrying personnel from the Adjutant's Office, had arrived in Nanjing at 8:05 AM. Believing that the "Meiling" special plane would not arrive until the afternoon, the welcomers returned to the city one after another. When the "Meiling" special plane arrived, only Commander-in-Chief He Yingqin and Minister Chen Cheng, who had returned, were there to greet them. The airport was extremely quiet. It was heard that after the Chairman disembarked, he asked if Chief Secretary Wu Wenguan and Chief Secretary Shao Lizi had arrived in Nanjing, and spoke briefly with He Yingqin, Chen Cheng, and Zhou Zhirou. He then went with his wife by car to rest at the official residence of the Central Military Academy.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 3rd] Chairman Chiang, accompanied by Madame Chiang, flew from Hankou to Nanjing at 11:00 AM on the morning of the 3rd. This was the Chairman's third visit to Nanjing since the victory, and also the formal triumphant return of our beloved leader to the capital from Chongqing. For days, the capital has been preparing for the May 5th Return to Capital Ceremony with extreme excitement. The arrival of the Chairman undoubtedly brought the excitement of the 800,000 citizens, who were eagerly awaiting, to a climax. On the 3rd, the Chairman's plane "Meiling" was piloted by Air Force Lieutenant Colonel Yu Fuen. There were more than 20 people accompanying him. When the Chairman and Madame Chiang disembarked, they smiled happily and repeatedly greeted Director Zhou Zhirou, who was in charge of arrangements. They then drove directly to the official residence to rest. At this time, although there were no welcoming personnel at Ming Palace Airport, as instructed by the Chairman beforehand, citizens gathered in groups around the airport upon hearing the news, and still gave the Chairman a gaze of infinite enthusiasm as his car passed by. At 3:00 PM, the Chairman hosted a tea party at the official residence to entertain former US President Hoover. At 5:00 PM, the Chairman, accompanied by Mayor Ma Shiyi, drove around the city, passing through National Government Road, Taiping Road, Zhongzheng Road, and Zhongshan North Road, directly to Xiaguan. The Chairman gave many instructions on Nanjing's municipal administration, expressed his approval of the city government's plan to establish an industrial zone, and instructed that vacant land on both sides of the roads in the urban area should be requisitioned by the government to build houses to enhance the appearance of the city. It was also reported that Madame Chiang visited Madame Marshall at the invitation of Marshal Marshall at 4:30 PM on the 3rd.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hankou, 2nd] Chairman Chiang, accompanied by Madame Chiang, inspected the entire city by car at around 8:00 PM on the evening of the 2nd, expressing great importance to the construction of the urban area of Hankou.</p>
<h3>President Truman Issues Statement; Aiding China and Korea's Economic Development; Sending Pauley to China to Investigate Northeast Industry</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 2nd] President Truman made a statement at a press conference today, saying: I have sent Mr. Pauley as a private representative to handle the issue of Far East reparations. When Mr. Pauley goes to the Far East in the future, he will investigate the nine eastern provinces of China, Korea, and various resources. The governments of other relevant countries have already been notified of Mr. Pauley's trip. I am confident that Mr. Pauley can enter the nine eastern provinces to conduct investigation work. The President then read a statement, in which he quoted the remarks of Under Secretary of State Acheson, namely that Mr. Pauley will go to the Far East at the end of this week at the request of the government and the State Department. The statement solemnly declared: "The goal of the United States is to support and foster the unity and economic development of China and Korea, while also ensuring that these countries are economically independent of Japan. Mr. Acheson once said: If the long-term peace and economic development plan in East Asia is to be realized, then China must make full use of its natural resources and various industries in the nine eastern provinces, and Korea must be in a position to develop its own resources. These are wise words. Mr. Pauley's trip will conduct various studies and investigations to propose various adjusted and reasonable plans for the industrial, economic, and health development of the nine eastern provinces and Korea, and to use various reparations from Japan to develop the natural resources of these countries. The conclusions made by Mr. Pauley after completing his mission will be based on various accurate facts and consistent opinions. Mr. Pauley's words and actions will be based on the broad perspective of the United States, which is based on the Far East reconstruction plan, to expand the development opportunities for millions of residents in the region. In short, the main purpose of this trip is to obtain various information and propose various opinions to assist the US government and its allies in formulating a plan for the Far East, thereby contributing to the peace and security of the Far East and the world."</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 3rd] President Truman hosted reporters and announced the final plan for Pauley to go to Korea and Northeast China for investigation. He also said: Pauley's investigation work will inevitably cause a conflict between the economic interests of the United States and the Soviet Union in Northeast Asia. Pauley's mission is extremely important. The White House announced that 20 experts, including industrial chemists, petroleum experts, and others, will jointly assist in the investigation of exactly what materials in the Northeast and Korea have been moved away by the Soviet Union, and how much remains. It is reported that the United States has formally notified the Soviet Union about sending Pauley to Northeast China and Korea for investigation and requested the Soviet Union to cooperate. However, no guarantee has been obtained so far. Unless the Soviet Union guarantees cooperation with the United States, Pauley may not be able to enter the Soviet-occupied areas of Korea or the areas of Northeast China that are still occupied by the Soviet army. Judging from the announced Pauley mission, it seems that economic policies between the US and the Soviet Union have begun to conflict.</p>
<h3>National Assembly Preparatory Committee Resolves; Requesting Government to Set Date for Meeting Soon</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 3rd] The National Assembly Preparatory Meeting held its second meeting at 9:00 AM on the morning of the 3rd. 261 representatives attended, passing the organization charter and rules of procedure of the meeting, and sending a telegram of respect to Chairman Chiang. The meeting adjourned at 12:00 PM and continued with its third meeting at 3:00 PM in the afternoon. A presidium of 21 people, including Huan Yushu, was formally elected. Xiang Jutan, Cao Jingyuan, Xi Yushu, Bai Rui, Fang Shaoyun, Xu Ganfang, and Shen Lingxiu took turns as chairmen. The following resolutions were made: (1) Requesting the government to set a date for the meeting as soon as possible; (2) All representatives will not leave Nanjing before the meeting is convened; (3) Telegraphed representatives stranded in various places to come to Nanjing as soon as possible; (4) Requesting the government to send representatives to attend the meeting to explain the reasons for the postponement of the meeting; (5) Opposing arbitrarily increasing the number of representatives. The meeting adjourned at 5:00 PM in the afternoon.</p>
<p>[Another telegram] Chen Jingchuan, representative of the Overseas Chinese in Siam to the National Assembly, together with Zheng Wulou, chairman of the Siam Overseas Chinese Relief of the Fatherland Famine Congress, and others, flew to Nanjing from Chongqing on the 3rd. Representative Chen Jingchuan prepared to attend the meeting, while Zheng Wulou came to Nanjing at the invitation of the Ministry of Food to discuss the rice issue.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 3rd] The Shanxi National Assembly representatives telegraphed the Nanjing National Assembly Representatives Association, requesting that they implore the National Government to still hold the meeting as scheduled according to the previous order. Otherwise, they will mobilize representatives to go to Nanjing to gather on their own to comply with public opinion.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Lanzhou, 3rd] The 24 National Assembly representatives remaining in Lanzhou, including Feng Yihan, telegraphed the central government regarding the postponement of the National Assembly, suggesting that the postponement period be determined, no more than one month. If the meeting cannot be convened by the deadline, they will mobilize representatives to gather automatically.</p>
<h3>Madame Chiang Instructs; Women's Movement Work in Hankou; Promoting Literacy and Running Nurseries</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Hankou, 3rd] (1) After Chairman Chiang arrived in Hankou, the people were overjoyed, and the business community here also became stable. The prices of gold, department store goods, and food have all fallen one after another. (2) Madame Chiang met with women representatives here yesterday, and gave two instructions on the work of the women's movement in the future: A. Promote literacy and production movements; B. Run nurseries and strengthen infant care work.</p>
<h3>Mei Siping's Treason Case Concluded in Beijing; Capital High Court to Announce Verdict on the 9th; Wife of Traitor Chu Minyi Applies for Retrial on Behalf of Her Husband</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Nanjing, 3rd] The Capital High Court opened the trial of the traitor Mei Siping this morning. The Chaotian Palace was crowded with people. More than 3,000 people were rejected from the square in front of the court because they did not have audience passes. At 9:00 AM, after three chimes of the bell, the bailiffs shouted to open the court. Presiding Judge Zhao Chen, Judges Ge Zhitan and Zheng Liyi, Examining Officer Li Shihang, and Clerk Xu Jun, five people wearing square caps and robes, entered the court one after another and took their seats. The whole place was silent, while the crowd on the square rioted, giving way. Four bailiffs escorted the traitor Mei into the court. Mei was wearing a light gray flannel jacket and yellow leather shoes, and sat silently on the right side of the litigation party's seat waiting for trial. The air in the courtroom suddenly became tense, and everyone wanted to see the once prominent traitor. The audience in the back row climbed up and craned their necks to watch from afar. At that time, the silver light flashed, and the sound of the "camera" rose sharply. The (China Electric) photographer rushed around, and the photographers of various newspapers became active, either squatting or standing upright, showing various wonderful forms, in order to find a suitable angle. Mei was still shameless under the gaze of everyone, turning his neck and looking around, to see how many people were counting his crimes. Mei entered the defendant's bar when his name was called by the presiding judge. After asking his name, age, and place of origin, Mei suddenly protested against the bailiffs for tying him with ropes during the interrogation. He was immediately refuted by the court.</p>
<p>Claiming to be Commanded in Secret Talks of Peace</p>
<p>After the prosecutor read the indictment, the presiding judge asked Mei whether he was a party member, what positions he had held, and what was the process of participating in the peace movement. Mei replied that he was a party member and had served as the director of the political science department of the Central Political University. As for the secret talks on the peace plan with the enemy Yingzuo Zhenzhao in Shanghai from Hong Kong, he claimed that it was under orders. The presiding judge immediately asked him under whose orders, and he replied that it was Wang Jingwei. At that time, he was the vice president and the special envoy stationed in Hong Kong, and went to Shanghai with Gao Zongwu to carry out activities under orders. At this time, the presiding judge sternly quoted what Chairman Chiang said: "We will never give up peace until the last moment, and we will never lightly talk about sacrifice until the last moment." "Once we resist the war, we will never make peace or compromise halfway. Compromise is the destruction of the country and the extinction of the race." Mei remained silent for a long time, and finally said that the national policy looked simple on the surface, but was actually very complicated. People who participate in politics often make mistakes, and they deliberately chose sophistry, mistakenly believing that Wang's "peace movement" was authorized by the central government, and the Japanese also mistakenly believed this, so they were very enthusiastic about the "peace movement." But later, Mei openly admitted that "peace" was his proposal, and stated how he helped the rear anti-Japanese war while serving in the puppet government. His confession was contradictory, which clearly showed that the traitor was boasting and shirking responsibility. The presiding judge also asked about admitting the puppet Manchukuo, opium monopoly, supplying the enemy with military food, etc. Mei always denied them and put all the responsibility on the deceased Wang Jingwei.</p>
<p>Presenting a Self-Defense Statement in Six Points</p>
<p>Finally, the court asked about his property and family. Mei replied that he never owned property and that his family had one wife, five sons, and two daughters. Mei had a book "The Complete Account of the Peace Movement" and a self-written statement of defense submitted to the court for trial. At 11:00 AM, the debate began. Mei defended himself with six points: (1) He and Gao Zongwu went to Japan under Wang's orders; (2) The negotiations with Yingzuo did not produce any results; (3) The chairman appointed the members of the puppet political committee, and everything was dictated by Wang alone. Although he was a member, he could not influence the political situation; (4) He did not do anything against his country during his five years of service in the puppet government; (5) Organizing the puppet government was a delaying tactic, and he believed that the war of resistance would be won under the leadership of Chairman Chiang; (6) The indiscriminate issuance of puppet currency was not within his authority. After Mei's defense, the public defender Liu Xiancai argued that the defendant absorbed materials, preserved power, reduced control, and restored industry in the occupied areas while serving in the puppet government. After the victory, he did not escape and handled the handover to the receiving personnel, requesting the court to make a fair judgment. At 11:45 AM, the debate ended, and the court ordered that the verdict be announced at 10:00 AM on the morning of the 9th of this month, and the defendant was remanded in custody.</p>
<p>Chu's Daughter Submits Document to High Court on Behalf of Her Mother</p>
<p>[This newspaper, Suzhou, 3rd] Today was the last day of the statutory period for applying for a retrial of the death sentence of the traitor Chu Minyi. At about 2:00 PM, when reporters went to the Suzhou High Court for interviews, they met Chu's daughter Meng Yuan. She was wearing a blue shirt and carrying a document to the High Court. When reporters inquired next to her, they learned that it was a submission from her mother Chu Chen Senzhen applying for a retrial on behalf of her husband, and she showed a copy to the reporters. The content of the submission was full of empty words and all kinds of sophistry, with no concrete evidence presented. It stated briefly that the defendant devoted himself to the great cause of the revolution, followed the Premier and "Mr. Wang," and never left for a single day, and listed three reasons: (1) The defendant also advocated war. The original judgment said that the defendant had always advocated uniting with the Japanese bandits, which was unfounded. The claims and remarks made after the establishment of the puppet government were based on his duties and positions. As for the so-called collusion with the Axis powers to recognize the puppet government in the original judgment, it was not due to the defendant's efforts to contact them. (2) The defendant held the title of Foreign Affairs Consultant, but he rarely advised on foreign affairs, let alone domestic affairs. (3) The signing of the Basic Treaty, Alliance Treaty, and Agreement was done by "Mr. Wang" personally, and the defendant did not co-sign. Although the puppet government declared war on Britain and the United States, it did not send a single soldier. Therefore, it requested that the original judgment be overturned and a fairer judgment be made.</p>
<h3>Jinan Group Goes to Gaomi; Convening a Meeting to Mediate the Jiaodong Conflict</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Jinan, 3rd] It is reported that the Communist army around Zhangdian on the Jiaoji Line is frequently mobilizing and harassing from time to time, and claiming that it will attack Zhangdian soon.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Jinan, 3rd] The Jinan Group flew to Qingdao and then to Gaomi and other places at 12:00 PM on the 3rd to mediate the Jiaodong conflict. The group included government representative Wen Ze, US representative Davis, and Communist representative Kuang Rennong. Upon arrival, they will convene a meeting of the commanders of the troops stationed on both sides to hold an important meeting.</p>
<p>[Another telegram] At 10:00 PM on the night of May 1st, the Communist army raided Mingshui (40 kilometers northeast of Jinan) for the second time. The intention was still to disturb the area. The defending troops were very calm, and the Communist army did not succeed in the end.</p>
<p>[Another telegram] Two hundred and twenty officers and soldiers of the Shandong Garrison Brigade were divided into groups on April 28th and went from the southern suburbs of Jinan to Shilihe via the FenShuiLing to purchase firewood. When they passed through Xingyun Mountain and Mingding Mountain, they were suddenly attacked by 500 Communist soldiers. The unarmed officers and soldiers of the Garrison Brigade suffered heavy casualties, with three officers and 40 soldiers killed or injured. Citizens are now afraid to set foot in the near suburbs of the city.</p>
<p>[United Press, Peiping, 3rd] The Propaganda Department's office in Peiping disclosed today that on April 27th, an American and a Swedish man were attacked by the Communist army on the way from Qingdao to Weixian in a Jeep. The incident occurred in Wenling Town, 23 miles northwest of Gaomi on the Qingji Railway. The two foreigners were non-military and were injured as a result. The Jeep they were traveling in was also damaged. They were rescued by the army and sent to Chishan for medical treatment. Their names and reasons for this trip are still unknown.</p>
<p>[This newspaper, Jinan, 3rd] According to refugees who escaped from Leling County, Zhang Ruhui, the secretary of the first district party headquarters in the county, was ordered to go to the east of the city to preside over the struggle, but was assassinated by the people on the way. His eyes were gouged out, and his limbs were cut off, which shows that the general public hates the Communist Party's cruel struggle movement to the bone.</p>
<h3>Nantong Once Tense; Yangtai and Other Places Peaceful</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Zhenjiang, 3rd] Since the Communist army attacked Nantong, rumors have been rife on the streets and alleys here. Some say that weapons were seized in a certain place, and others say that a certain number of Communist troops were found in a certain place. People's opinions vary, and they rush to tell each other in alarm. According to the bureau, except for Nantong, which was once tense recently, there have been no military operations in Yang, Tai, and other places north and south of the Yangtze River. The National Army is strictly deployed around Yangzhen, and warships patrol the river surface even at night, which can guarantee that the Communist army has absolutely no activity. Also, when the Communist army attacked Guanyin Mountain and Xiaohai Town in Nantong on the 27th of last month, it simultaneously sent troops to capture Changle Town and Batou Town, which belong to Haimen County.</p>
<h3>Luo Ruiqing Returns to Peiping</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Peiping, 3rd] Luo Ruiqing, Chief of Staff of the Communist Party of the Executive Headquarters, stated to reporters yesterday as the representative of Zhou Enlai: To the best of his knowledge, there is no item in Marshall's proposal that requires the Communist army to withdraw from Changchun. Luo had gone to the Northeast on behalf of Zhou Enlai to inspect, and then went to Chongqing to report to Zhou. He returned north one day before Marshall left Chongqing. Due to weather conditions, the plane landed in Zhangjiakou and did not return to Peiping until one day later.</p>
<h3>Chief Secretary Wu Dingchang; Sells the National Seal and Arrives in the Capital; Wu Guozhen and Shao Lizi Also Arrived</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Nanjing, 3rd] Minister of Propaganda Wu Guozhen, accompanied by Zeng Xubai, Director of the International Propaganda Department, arrived in Beijing aboard China Aviation's No. 92 special plane. After Wu disembarked, he declared to reporters that there was nothing to report today and that he would hold a detailed discussion later. [Central News Agency, Nanjing, 3rd] National Government Chief Secretary Wu Dingchang, Secretary General of the Political Participation Council Shao Lizi, Party Committee Chief of Chongqing Municipality Fang Zhi, and Director Chen of the Political Affairs Bureau of the Chief Secretary's Office, flew to Beijing from Chongqing on the same plane at 3:00 PM on the afternoon of the 3rd.

In addition, Liu Jianqun, acting secretary-general of the Central Corps Department of the Youth League, and Luo Jialun, former supervisor of Xinjiang, and his wife Zhang Weizhen, flew to Beijing on the 3rd.</p>
<h3>Magistrate of Pinglu County Assassinated; Entourage Killed Simultaneously</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 3rd] Wang Bingsheng, magistrate of Pinglu County, was shot and killed by the Communist army on the way back to Pinglu from Yuanxi. Three members of his entourage were also killed at the same time.</p>
<h3>100,000 Main Force of the Communist Army Defeated; National Army Enters Benxihu; Du Yuming Returns to Shenyang after Inspection</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Peiping, 3rd] The National Army entered Benxihu on the 2nd. The new mayor, Liu Yifu, has set the 21st as the date of his inauguration. Fierce fighting continues in Sipingjie. Officials have hinted that it may be captured in three or four days and said that peace talks can begin after the National Army returns to Changchun. The previous Northeast War severely damaged spring plowing, as planting in the Northeast generally takes place around Qingming, and at the latest cannot be later than Guyu. Now Guyu has passed, and the summer solstice is approaching. The reporter returned to Peiping from Shenyang today and saw the flowers blooming in the old capital, and my heart was happy beyond words. When the reporter left Shenyang, the trees in the Northeast had just turned green, and the fields still had no green, and it was still winter.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 3rd] The most powerful main force of the Communist army, more than 100,000 people, was driven out and scattered by the National Army in Benxi Creek at 9:00 AM on the morning of the 3rd. Commander Du Yuming has completed his inspection and returned to Panyang this morning. At 5:00 PM, he hosted Chinese and foreign reporters at the Commander's Office. Deputy Commander Liang Huasheng and Chief of Staff Zhao Jiaxiang were present. Commander Du told reporters that the main force of the Communist army in Benxi has been disbanded, and Shenyang can be guaranteed to be safe from now on. Du also said: The most important thing is that the people of Benxi can be liberated. After Du finished speaking, the reporter asked about the takeover of Andong. Du said: It can be carried out after the traffic is restored.</p>
<p>[Another telegram] The Communist army (Liaodong Military Region) Zeng Kelin and Zhang Xueshi used the mountains and ridges of Shenyang, Liaoyang, and Benxi to prevent the National Army from going to Benxi to take over. The Communist army gathered its 3rd, 4th, 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th, 11th, and 12th brigades, as well as an artillery regiment and guards, and repeatedly harassed the troops stationed on the south bank of the Hun River, coerced the people to prevent spring plowing, plundered food, forcibly recruited men, destroyed traffic, and claimed to peek into Shenyang. Our troops taking over Benxi set out on the 28th of last month, and cleared the resistance of the Communist army along the way, entering Benxi at 9:00 AM on the morning of the 3rd, and are now restoring order and appeasing the residents.</p>
<p>Zheng Jiemin Talks in Peiping; Communist Army's Capture of Changchun Is Unreasonable</p>
<p>[United Press, Peiping, 3rd] Communist Party officials believe that the scale of the civil war in the Northeast and North China is not only comparable to before the ceasefire agreement was established, but almost equal. General Zheng Jiemin, the government representative of the Executive Headquarters, told reporters that, in his view, "the situation in the Northeast is becoming increasingly serious." He said: The Communist army's capture of Changchun is unreasonable, because the government had received it beforehand. But no matter how the situation develops, we must do our best to find some reasonable solution to prevent the situation from worsening further. According to news from both the Chinese Communist Party over the past week, it is believed that at least nine different locations are currently engaged in military activity or fierce fighting: (1) Sipingjie, 70 miles south of Changchun; (2) Benxihu, 42 miles southeast of Jiyang; (3) the railway line from Shanhaiguan to Jinzhou; (4) Communist commando teams of 200 to 2,000 people are constantly destroying the railway between Peiping and Tianjin; (5) the railway line between Peiping and Baoding, where mutual bombardment with artillery, mortars, machine guns, and rifles is a daily occurrence; (6) the railway line between Qingdao and Jinan; (7) the northern Jiangsu area; (8) the "Central China Military Region"; (9) fierce fighting has broken out again in northern Shanxi.</p>
<h3>Zhou Enlai and Others Arrive in Beijing, To Confer with Government and Marshal Ma Soon</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 3rd] CCP representatives Zhou Enlai, Deng Yingchao, Lu Dingyi, Liao Chengzhi, Wang Bingnan, and over sixty staff members from the Xinhua News Agency and Xinhua Daily, arrived in Beijing at 6:00 PM and 6:10 PM respectively, aboard two aircraft. Zhou and Deng were aboard Marshal Ma's "Constellation" aircraft. After disembarking, Zhou and Deng went by car to their new residence in Meiyuan New Village for rest. They did not make any statements to the Chinese and foreign reporters present. However, Lu Dingyi made a propagandistic statement, claiming that the Central Plains War had already begun, and the Central Government had ordered eleven armies and twenty-six divisions to attack the Communist forces. He also stated that Mao Zedong intended to release the American reporter and Central News Agency and Central Daily reporters captured in Changchun, but the method was still under study. Furthermore, CCP representative Dong Biwu is currently staying in Chongqing and is scheduled to come to Beijing next Tuesday.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 3rd] President Chiang, Special Envoy Marshall, and CCP representative Zhou Enlai have successively arrived in Beijing. However, the Northeast issue, which the world is watching with great interest, whether negotiations can resume in the short term is still something that each party expects. According to our reporter, Marshall and President Chiang will not discuss the Northeast issue in the next two days, as both sides are awaiting the CCP's response as to whether they are willing to withdraw from Changchun. Judging from the CCP's current actions, they may temporarily avoid the difficult Northeast issue and emphasize the so-called seriousness of the Central Plains Military Region, in order to buy time to carefully consider the advantages and disadvantages of the Northeast situation and its consequences. If so, whether the Northeast negotiations can resume within the next week is still uncertain, because the government is determined to receive Changchun in order to safeguard national sovereignty.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 3rd] CCP representative Zhou Enlai avoided giving concrete answers when asked about the "Central Plains Region" war and the Northeast situation, only saying that he would continue negotiations with the government and Marshal Ma after arriving in Beijing. It is also learned that the Youth Party delegation will come to Beijing on the 4th.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 3rd] Shao Lizi, Secretary-General of the Political Consultative Council, told this newspaper that although negotiations for peace, unity, and unification are fraught with difficulties, he believes that understanding can eventually be reached, and the national affairs can still be viewed optimistically.</p>

<h3>President Chiang Receives Hoover in Beijing, Discussing China's Food Problem, Hoover Returns to Shanghai the Same Day and Flies to Seoul for Inspection</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 3rd] President Truman's personal representative, former U.S. President Herbert Hoover, accompanied by Food Minister Xu Kan, arrived in Beijing by plane from Shanghai at 11:20 AM today. Marshall personally welcomed Hoover at the Dajiaochang Airport at 11:10 AM. More than thirty people, including Vice Minister of Transportation Ling Hongxun, were also present to welcome him. After disembarking, Hoover shook hands with the welcoming party and then went to Marshall's residence on Ninghai Road with Marshall to rest. Minister Xu Kan told reporters at the airport that the UNRRA would ship a large quantity of rice to China.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 3rd] After arriving in Beijing, President Chiang met with former U.S. President Hoover and Special Envoy Marshall at the military academy official residence at 3:00 PM this afternoon. President Chiang expressed his gratitude to Mr. Hoover for his long journey to investigate the urgent relief needs of various countries in the Far East, especially his concern for the post-disaster recovery in China's disaster areas, the allocation of food at the present time, and transportation problems. He exchanged views on the urgent food transportation problem. The conversation lasted for more than an hour. Then at 4:20 PM, he personally went to the airport to see Hoover off. Hoover's special plane took off for Shanghai at 4:30 PM.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 3rd] Former U.S. President Hoover, currently Chairman of the Emergency Relief Committee, and his entourage, Mayper, Copthorne, and Fitzgerald, were hosted at a banquet by Foreign Minister Wang Shijie this afternoon. Marshal Marshall, General McClure, Admiral Cooke, Admiral Murray, Counselor Smysor of the U.S. Embassy, and our military and political leaders Chief of Staff General He Yingqin, Minister Chen Cheng, Minister Xu Kan, Secretary-General Jiang Menglin, Vice Minister Gan Naiguang, and Vice Minister Liu Kai were all invited to attend. In the afternoon, President Chiang and his wife hosted a tea party for Hoover and Marshal Marshall at the official residence. The President expressed his gratitude to Mr. Hoover for his enthusiasm in solving China's food shortage, and recalled that during the Yangtze River flood in China in 1931, Mr. Hoover, during his presidency, had donated a huge sum of money. After the tea party, the President and his wife personally saw Mr. Hoover off to the plane. Mr. Hoover and his party left Beijing for Shanghai at 4:30 PM. He is scheduled to fly to Seoul, Korea tomorrow, and then to Tokyo the day after tomorrow, and then return home. According to Minister of Food Xu Kan, China's food shortage is severe. He requested the United States to ship 200,000 tons of grain to China every month from May to August, and to find ways to help China solve transportation problems, so that the grain can be transported to the areas where the disaster is currently serious after it arrives at the port. In principle, Mr. Hoover has expressed his agreement.</p>
<h3>Relief for China's Severe Disaster, First Solve Transportation Difficulties, Hoover Speaks to Shanghai Residents</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] "Relief Envoy" Former U.S. President Herbert Hoover returned to Shanghai from Beijing at 4:30 PM yesterday. At 6:30 PM, he held a press conference with Chinese and foreign journalists on the eighth floor of the Construction Building, giving a speech for half an hour, accompanied by Lieutenant General Gillon, Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Army in China, Kaiser, Director of the UNRRA in China, and Connors.</p>
<h3>Heavily Damaged by War, China Needs Food Urgently</h3>
<p>First, Mr. Hoover read a written statement. Throughout the meeting, Mr. Hoover kept his head down, looking at the documents in his hand as he spoke, his tone heavy. He said that China's food needs are very large. China has suffered eight years of war damage, agricultural decline, and the pain of droughts and floods. There is currently no sufficient material to accurately calculate the actual tonnage of food needed, but the number must exceed the amount transported to the interior. During the serious period from May to September, various transportation capacities must be utilized as much as possible to distribute 200,000 tons of food to each district every month.</p>
<p>As a result of a long-term lack of organization, the number of starving people cannot be accurately counted, but it is undoubtedly estimated to be in the millions, because the disaster areas are distributed in many provinces. Reports from Chinese and foreign authorities state that the number of starving people in the inland provinces is increasing daily, due to their inability to resist infectious diseases. Entire villages and townships have not yet died out in the vast areas, but if supplies cannot be delivered, this serious situation will inevitably occur within a few weeks.</p>
<h3>Relieving China's Food Shortage, Transportation is the Most Difficult</h3>
<p>Mr. Hoover then answered written questions from reporters, saying that the food shortage problem is far more serious than the war disaster, but what is comforting is that this dangerous problem can be solved from September 1st this year, because September is the time of the great harvest, and the world's grain-producing areas can supply food.</p>
<p>The most difficult thing in relieving China's disaster is the "transportation" problem. Without convenient transportation, even with a large supply, it will be of no avail. China has suffered the three most painful disasters in the world: (1) war disaster, (2) drought disaster, (3) flood disaster. It has been devastated in recent years. Thousands of miles of railways have been destroyed, many waterways have been blocked, and transportation tools are lacking. This is also different from Europe. European countries have fewer transportation difficulties, and public health is more advanced, so it is convenient to transport relief supplies, and the mortality rate can be reduced. If China can solve the transportation problem, the dangerous situation can be eliminated. Special Envoy Marshall discussed this point face-to-face with the US government during his return to the United States, and has requested the allocation of a number of aircraft for transporting food in China. Colonel Harrison, Personal Representative of President Truman, is responsible for investigating the food shortage situation in China, and the UNRRA and the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CRRRA) will be responsible for distributing relief and resolving transportation problems. The objects of relief will absolutely not be distinguished by party affiliation, religion, or other relationships. The people in the communist areas will also be treated equally.</p>
<h3>Inspecting the World's Food Shortage, Mr. Hoover Has Three Tasks</h3>
<p>Mr. Hoover reported that the three tasks of this inspection of Europe and Asia are: (1) To investigate the famine situation in various countries and determine which countries need the most food relief. (2) To discuss the use of materials from countries with surplus materials. (3) To return to the country and make a detailed factual report to President Truman. Mr. Hoover said that there are six food experts who came with him, five of whom worked with him on food relief during World War I and have rich experience. When asked about political issues by a reporter, Mr. Hoover stated that he had no other tasks other than food on this trip and did not want to talk about political issues. He was also unwilling to disclose what he discussed with Marshal Marshall in Nanjing, and various criticisms of the relief situation in China were also not within the scope of his mission. Mr. Hoover specifically emphasized: "Difficult problems are always in front, not behind. We should try to build the future."</p>
<p>Mr. Hoover also reported that there are currently about 800 million disaster victims worldwide, including 325 million in Europe, 220 million in the Indian Ocean region, and 300 million in the Pacific region. The investigation of the daily food intake per person is measured in calories, with 2,200 calories, 1,800 calories, or 1,250 calories. The lowest is only 1,000 calories. Comparing the food shortage of World War I with this time, Mr. Hoover said that World War I destroyed less farmland, so it was easier to restore the original state, and supplies could be produced to provide assistance, which is quite different this time.</p>
<p>Mr. Hoover stated that the US authorities are determined to collect as much surplus material as possible to help various countries. The American people themselves are doing their best to reduce and save food to supply to the disaster victims. Canada, Argentina, and Siam all have surplus grain. Although Siam has a considerable amount of rice, it is also limited by transportation difficulties and cannot be transported. They are now trying to repair roads and build bridges to improve transportation.</p>
<h3>Hope for China's Unification to Save Countless Lives</h3>
<p>Finally, Mr. Hoover expressed his admiration and gratitude for the cooperative spirit of the relevant authorities in China and the United States, church groups, the Red Cross, and various volunteer service organizations. He then hoped that all the people of China could cooperate and unite in the future to save countless lives.</p>
<p>Mr. Hoover is scheduled to fly to Seoul, Korea this morning to inspect, then go to Japan, and then return to Washington to report to President Truman.</p>
<h3>A General Who Recently Returned to Shanghai Talks About the Northeast Situation Awaiting Clarification, Hoping the Communist Army Will Cooperate Sincerely with the Nation as the Priority, More Than a Thousand Students Join the Army and Have Been Organized into an Independent Battalion</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] I recently visited a senior National Army general who flew to Shanghai from the Northeast a week ago. He said that the areas currently controlled by the National Army in the Northeast can in fact be categorized by Shenyang, Sipingjie, Yingkou, and Fushun. The communist army is transporting to the Northeast by land from northern Jiangsu on foot to Rehe, advancing along the Beining Road in the snow. Because the majority is forced, there are complaints everywhere and there is no fighting spirit. Those who transport by sea are from Qingdao, and they take Japanese motorboats. Their equipment is taken entirely from Japanese prisoners. The public is coerced to act as their vanguard, and they are especially accustomed to using tactics of densely packed formations, in fact sacrificing the public.</p>
<p>The number of National Army soldiers in the Northeast is far fewer than that of the communist army, but with justice on their side, their morale does not flag. In the Battle of Shaling, the National Army, with a ratio of 20 to 1, and with less than two battalions of military strength, resisted six regiments of the Communist Army. As a result, the Communist Army still suffered 20,000 casualties and retreated. Examining this Communist Army offensive, their intention is in fact to cut off the Beining Line, so that the entire Northeast falls into their hands. However, our army discovered their scheme early and accurately seized the railway. Although the Communist Army destroyed it many times, our army was able to repair it in a short period of time, so the Communist Army's initial intention has become a bubble.</p>
<p>The people of the Northeast wholeheartedly support the government. Everywhere the National Army goes, the warmth of the welcome is truly inspiring. Many elders listed their tragic experiences to the National Army soldiers, even to the point of tears, which saddened those who heard it. Many young students in the Northeast joined the army. More than a thousand people are currently gathered in Jinzhou and Beiping, and an independent battalion has been formed among them, listed as a youth army.</p>
<p>Although the number of communist army soldiers is large, they are ultimately a mix. Therefore, positions such as artillerymen are mostly filled by Japanese prisoners. Our army is a hundred-battle-hardened army. If we talk about strength, there is really no problem. If the Communist Army cannot abide by the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference and wants to go its own way, then the National Army will naturally only have to forcibly take over. At that time, destroying the old and rotten will be an easy task. However, after Marshall's arrival in Beijing, the KMT-CPC (Nationalist-Communist) issue can certainly find a solution, and we deeply hope for sincere cooperation, with the nation as the priority. China really cannot fight any more. For the past eight years, people have been separated from their families. At present, victory has arrived, but people are still separated from their families. It is extremely heartbreaking. This is what we deeply hope that the Communist Army can thoroughly change and repent.</p>
<p>As for the Communist Army's rumors that there are American advisors in the National Army, the spokesperson absolutely denied it, saying: "At present, there are absolutely no Americans in the Northeast National Army." The spokesperson admitted that the National Army's transportation and supply are still making little progress. The railway is destroyed from time to time, and there is very little control over sea transport. Therefore, the clarification of the situation in the Northeast may still take a considerable amount of time.</p>

In order to meet the needs of sound personnel, the personnel management staff originally set up in Hefei, Liu'an, Tongcheng, Wuhu, Xuancheng, Fuyang, Shouxian, and Suxian, eight counties, were recently changed to personnel offices, with one director and one clerk in each section, to expand their business. As for the amount of funds needed for the construction of various counties in the province after the war, and the percentage rates of each department, after the Finance Department and the Provincial Accounting Office signed and requested the Provincial Government for instructions, the Standing Committee of the Provincial Committee resolved yesterday to apply for the amount of 600 million yuan, with the construction department accounting for one-third, and the rest being equally distributed by other departments.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Promoting the Spirit of the May Fourth Movement!</h3>
<p>Today marks the twenty-seventh anniversary of the student movement that swept the nation from Peiping (Beijing), a manifestation of China's national awakening; this is the momentous May Fourth Movement. In the history of China's national liberation movement, the May Fourth Movement holds epoch-making significance. Many of those who participated in this movement back then have now become the backbone of various sectors of Chinese society. Recalling the vigorous movement that began on this day twenty-seven years ago, now that the War of Resistance has been won, the land has been restored to its glory, and the nation is entering the stage of national construction, reminiscing about the past cannot but evoke a multitude of emotions. After twenty-seven years, although the fervent emotions of that time have changed with the variations of time, it is still necessary for young friends today to commemorate "May Fourth" and continue to carry forward the "May Fourth" spirit.</p>
<p>The so-called "May Fourth Movement" originally had both political and cultural significance in contemporary Chinese history. From a political standpoint, there are also two aspects: external and internal. From the external aspect, it was the earliest and most concrete manifestation of the Chinese national movement, and it was also the beginning of the Chinese youth's movement to uphold national rights. After the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895, national consciousness had already begun to grow among some Chinese people. After the Russo-Japanese War, Japan intensified its aggression against us, becoming increasingly fierce. Therefore, China's national movement was almost inseparable from anti-Japanese consciousness. During the First World War, Japan took advantage of the great powers being preoccupied in Western Europe and intensified its aggression against us, proposing the so-called Twenty-One Demands, attempting to turn the entire China into a Japanese dependency. At that time, the rulers disregarded national interests and fawned on Japan in many ways, thus arousing public outrage. Students in Peiping held strikes and demonstrations, destroying the residences of the "traitors" Cao Rulin, Lu Zongyu, and Zhang Zongxiang, and for a time, all regions responded, affecting the entire country. From its external political significance, the May Fourth Movement was indeed the initial and concrete manifestation of the Chinese national movement. Due to this movement, the Chinese delegates to the Paris Peace Conference finally refused to sign the Treaty of Versailles; also because of this movement, the Washington Naval Conference was eventually convened and Shandong was returned to China. Therefore, the May Fourth Movement was quite successful in its external political significance. China's resistance against Japanese aggression, since the May Fourth Movement, through the May Thirtieth Incident during the Northern Expedition era, the Battle of the Great Wall after the September 18th Incident, the Battle of Shanghai, until today after the July 7th Incident, has only fulfilled its mission with the victorious conclusion of the War of Resistance. From its internal political significance, the May Fourth Movement was a movement to fight for democracy. The Republic of China, established following the Xinhai Revolution, was occupied by warlords and remnants of feudalism, and politics were corrupt, and human rights were not guaranteed. In order to combat the corrupt bureaucracy of the time and promote the spirit of revolution, bureaucrats like Cao Rulin who sought personal gain through treason were attacked. This was essentially continuing the spirit of the Xinhai Revolution and a revolutionary movement to fight for democracy.</p>
<p>As a political movement, the May Fourth Movement externally involved anti-Japanese demonstrations to ensure national survival, and internally involved the struggle for civil rights to seek political reform; its characteristics were nationalism and "democracy"—civil rights or (democracy) ideology. Judging by its nature, the meaning of this movement was somewhat similar to the student movements that appeared in Germany and continental Europe in the 1840s after the Congress of Vienna. At that time, Peiping was the center of higher education in our country. We cannot know whether the rise of this movement directly or indirectly received the influence of the student movements that appeared in continental Europe in the nineteenth century. However, in terms of its development form and significance, the May Fourth Movement was somewhat similar to the student movements that appeared in continental Europe in the nineteenth century. From the perspective of Chinese politics, after the May Fourth Movement, the evolution of Chinese politics turned to a new path, which was the struggle of the masses. Before this, revolutionaries either engaged in assassinations of powerful figures or engaged in inciting the military, often failing to pay attention to the power of mass movements. The May Fourth Movement opened a new path for Chinese politics to win over the masses. Subsequently, the reorganization of the Chinese Nationalist Party and the birth of the Chinese Communist Party were both directly and indirectly influenced by the May Fourth Movement. Because the May Fourth Movement ignited vigorous nationalism, the Chinese National Revolution also gained a new force. By utilizing this new force, the National Revolution actively and smoothly unfolded, eventually overthrowing the warlords and completing unification.</p>
<p>However, the significance of the May Fourth Movement in the political field seems to be less than its significance in the cultural field. Although the May Fourth Movement itself was a political movement, the ideological liberation caused by the rise of this movement played a significant role in the cultural field. In the cultural sphere, the most well-known is, of course, the so-called New Culture Movement and the establishment of vernacular literature. The entry of dialects into texts was "already present in ancient times." After the May Fourth Movement, because of the promotion of new literature and art, the scope of the use of vernacular language in texts was expanded. Today, we use vernacular language to write articles. To those before the May Fourth Movement, especially those classical prose writers, they would probably say that this is an insult to Chinese characters. However, today, except for stubborn conservatives, vernacular literature is the general standard. The constructive role of the May Fourth Movement in the cultural field is probably just this one point. Beyond this, its role in the cultural field can be said to be mostly negative and destructive. Under the cry of "Down with the Confucian Shop," our inherent traditions, the cultural heritage left to us by our ancestors, were often despised. At that time, some people even advocated "non-filial piety" and advocated "public wives." Looking at this now, it is inevitably filled with the exposure of infantile diseases, but at that time, it was earnestly and enthusiastically discussed by "newly-minded" new youths, just like "communism." Starting from the inherent traditions of our country, doubts arose about the records of past Chinese history, especially ancient history. The result of the evolution of the atmosphere of doubt later was the bankruptcy of all traditional values. Since "non-filial piety" can be advocated, infidelity, unchastity, and even illegality can be advocated; at this point, our country's inherent code of conduct lost its regularity, moral standards were no longer praised, and the discipline of society was also crumbling!</p>
<p>After liberating the shackles of our country's inherent ideological traditions, after the May Fourth Movement, Chinese thought was dominated by two foreign ideological trends. Until now, the Chinese intellectual world has not been able to completely liberate itself from these two ideological trends. The first is the so-called empiricism and superficial liberalism; the second is Marxism and its associated aggregate of consciousness. After the May Fourth Movement, Professor Dewey of Columbia University in the United States temporarily seemed to replace Confucius, the "teacher of all ages." Later, Bertrand Russell from England came. After the Confucian shop was overthrown, Dewey and Russell seemed to have become a "sage" and a "vice-sage," respectively. This ideological trend, more than twenty years later, is still talked about with relish today. This is because Chinese scholars, for more than twenty years, have certainly broken free from the shackles of the Confucian shop, but have also added the shackles of the superficialities of Western doctrines. They have not seen the entire picture of Western culture, but adhere to the prejudice of pseudo-knowledge. Those who boast of being progressive have broken through this prejudice, but have added another shackle without realizing that they cannot extricate themselves. This is the shackle of Marxism. From Marx, Engels, Lenin, and even Plekhanov, etc., saying that their thoughts can represent absolute truth and will never change, who can believe it? However, Chinese "literati," "scholars," or "virtuous persons," and "celebrities," because they are fond of fashion, still seem to be savoring Marxism-Leninism with relish. Of course, Marxism-Leninism must be used to discuss politics and economics, and even Marxism-Leninism must be used to discuss history and culture, insisting that a certain era in China is a certain kind of society. Although this is despised by discerning people in the academic and ideological circles, who believe that it is like those who carve a mark on a boat to find a lost sword, it is also enough to see the depth of the remaining poison of the shackle of Marxism-Leninism.</p>
<p>Today, when we commemorate the May Fourth Movement, we should be vigilant. For more than twenty years, our intellectual world has not been able to liberate itself from superficial prejudices, which is our shame. The consequences caused by the May Fourth Movement back then were the overthrow of our traditional idols. Destruction was a necessary means of construction, but we cannot have only destruction without construction. Today, the country has won the War of Resistance, and we have completed one of the political goals of the initial May Fourth Movement. In the cultural field, the work of construction should be actively promoted along with the unfolding of the great cause of national construction. We must liberate ourselves from narrow prejudices and establish a culture of the Three Principles of the People that is suitable for China's national conditions. Only in this way can we continue to carry forward the spirit of the May Fourth Movement.</p>

<h3>Tokyo International Tribunal Opens: Japanese War Criminals Submissively Stand Trial; Indictment Reading Unfinished Yesterday, to Resume This Morning; Okawa Has Mental Breakdown in Court, Repeatedly Slaps Tojo's Head</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Tokyo Correspondent, 3rd] The trial of twenty-eight major Japanese war criminals began this morning. The court is located within the Army Ministry, with the nine judges' seats facing the defendants' dock, and the Allied dignitaries' gallery to the left. Around 10:00 AM, General Zhu Shuming, accompanied by General Eichelberger, commander of the Eighth Army, attended the hearing. The Allied and Japanese press seats are set up to the right. Allied personnel and Japanese spectators are all in the court's second floor, and the International Military Tribunal prosecutors' seats are in the center of the courtroom. The trial was scheduled to begin at 10:30 AM, but IItagaki and Kimura, who had just been escorted from Bangkok and arrived at Atsugi Airport, were still waiting to be taken to court for trial, which slightly delayed the start. The court waited for an hour, but they hadn't arrived, leaving two seats vacant in the defendant's dock. Six Japanese war criminals, led by Kido, entered the court one after another and sat quietly in the defendant's dock. Tojo sat in the center of the front row, with Doihara to his right, Hata Shunroku, Hirota, and Minami Jiro, and Hoshino, Kaya, and Kido to his left. The remaining criminals were seated behind Tojo. The Allied prosecutors, led by Chief Prosecutor Keenan, took their seats in the center. At this time, Bailiff Captain Mead announced: "Everyone stand, the judges are entering." Amidst the sound of everyone standing, Chief Judge Webb led the way, and the judges took their seats under the flags of the nine Allied nations in order. Chinese Judge Mei Ru'ao sat in the first position below the Chief Judge, and journalists from various Allied countries all witnessed the Chinese judge receiving this honorable seat. They all whispered to each other. The reporter told them that China lost 20 million people during the War of Resistance, so it should occupy a seat in all international honors events. Chief Judge Webb first announced the opening of the court, and Keenan then introduced each prosecutor to each judge. The first one to be introduced was Chinese Prosecutor Xiang Zhexun, saying that he was the Chief Prosecutor of the Shanghai District Court of the Republic of China. All the people paid close attention to this Chinese prosecutor, especially attracting the attention of the Japanese war criminals. After this, each translator raised their hands under the leadership of Captain Mead and swore an oath, expressing their loyalty. At around 11:15 AM, Chief Judge Webb announced a recess, and the court would reconvene at 2:30 PM in the afternoon.</p>
<p>In his opening remarks, Chief Judge Webb said, "Never in the history of the judgment of criminals has there been one as important as today's. We are a tribunal organized by civilians, selected by the Supreme Courts of each country. On the other hand, the defendants are the leaders of the peak of Japan. The defendants are guilty of three crimes: disrupting world peace, violating the customs of war, and violating humanitarianism. Such heinous crimes can only be tried by organizing an international military tribunal."</p>
<p>At 2:30 PM in the afternoon, the court continued. Keenan handed the indictment to the judges, and Webb ordered Captain Mead to read the indictment to each criminal. When the translator recited the section in the indictment about Japanese militarists massacring the Chinese people in Japanese, Okawa Shumei, the perpetrator of the former Mukden Incident and chief advocate of expelling whites from Asia, suddenly laughed loudly. Okawa was sitting behind Tojo. When he heard Tojo's words about disrupting international law and attacking Pearl Harbor, he suddenly slapped Tojo's bald head with his right hand. Tojo only responded with a bitter smile. When the translator read the section that hundreds of thousands of Chinese civilians and unarmed people were massacred by the Japanese in Nanjing, Okawa slapped Tojo's head a second time, and then muttered prayers, unbuttoned his shirt, and exposed his emaciated chest. At this time, laughter broke out in the courtroom. Bailiff Captain Mead shouted, "Maintain order." Okawa was finally dragged out of the courtroom by military police. By 4:45 PM, the indictment had been read to the forty-seventh article. Chief Judge Webb announced a recess and scheduled the trial to resume at 9:30 AM the next morning. By then, the indictment can be completely read, and the defendants will offer their defenses.</p>
<h3>Various Aspects of War Criminals: Emaciated Bodies Wearing Worn-Out Military Uniforms; Each Person Looks Like a Robber Being Tried After Committing a Crime</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 3rd] The world's largest murder case began today. Twenty-six tattered defendants sat in a magnificent courtroom. On their thin faces, they weakly wore a look of anger. This kind of expression was once a symbol of the Japanese who once dominated and were invincible. In the past, this expression was the trademark of the victorious Japanese, but now it is outwardly fierce but inwardly weak.</p>
<p>Feign Calmness</p>
<p>, it is indeed the traditional warlike nature of the island nation. These people sometimes regard themselves as modern samurai, wanting to inherit the good dreams of past conquests. Tojo seemed to want to imitate the Spartan warriors, and Matsuoka Yosuke, although a civil servant who loved comfort, seemed to want to share in the "difficulties of previous money." Marquis Kido was formerly the highest-ranking civil servant of the Empire, wearing a very plain uniform, even when attending Emperor Hirohito. Today, they will be subjected to a trial of life and death. They entered the courtroom with a look of frustration that cannot be concealed by anger. This frustration once tightly gripped countless wartime sufferers under their tyranny. They were wearing worn-out military uniforms, draped over their emaciated bodies due to imprisonment, making them look</p>
<p>Strange and Funny</p>
<p>Like Tojo and others, they will undoubtedly try their best to defend themselves in court to prove the "legitimacy" of their war. Most of the defendants will try to shirk responsibility. As the trial continues, some may become more and more indifferent. Although this morning's brief court session was a routine procedure, it also gives a glimpse into how the true colors of these former rulers will gradually be exposed. In front of these people are those who are judging their past behavior, neatly dressed and well-mannered. Surrounding them are military police in beautiful uniforms. These powerful children defeated their fanciful but actually vulnerable army. In the gallery above the defendants' dock are a few relatives and friends of the defendants and representatives of the Japanese government. Strangely enough, Tojo is</p>
<p>Most Uncomfortable</p>
<p>Among all the defendants. The man who attempted suicide so poorly sat with a sunken face, with a briefcase in front of him, the big one being his "self-defense statement." Tojo also put on his tortoiseshell-rimmed glasses, just like in his wartime photos. Kido's expression was like a naughty boy arrested for mischief, maintaining this appearance throughout the opening session. On his face with glasses, a look of anger curved. He may be the shortest of all the defendants, barely able to see over the front of the dock. Matsuoka, who was once powerful in the Foreign Ministry, and Minami Jiro, who was once a major figure in the military clique, both had</p>
<p>Gaunt Cheeks</p>
<p>Due to living in prison for a long time, they are not very attractive. Among all the defendants, Matsuoka is probably the only one who can understand English statements. The others must wait for the slow translation procedure. Some other major criminals look like robbers being tried after committing a crime. General Shimada has a scar on the lower left cheek. General Saito sat next to him, staring intently, like a strict follower of precepts, wearing a swollen military uniform. Former Prime Minister Koiso had a pursed mouth and an arrogant attitude. In the defendant's dock in a murder trial, there has never been such a contrast.</p>
<h3>Odds and Ends</h3>
<p>The viewing gallery in the court was packed from the earliest moment, with the majority being Japanese, including a son and a daughter of former Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka Yosuke.</p>
<p>Everyone who came to the venue to observe the proceedings was searched by the American military police, but no contraband was found.</p>
<p>Sir Wright, Chairman of the United Nations War Crimes Commission, also attended the hearing. Mr. Wright was formerly a Judge of the High Court of England, and his visit to Japan this time was at the invitation of MacArthur.</p>
<p>Most of the criminals wore casual clothes, with only Hashimoto Kingoro wearing wooden clogs. The criminals once commanded tens of thousands of people, but now they have no theatrical style. On the first day of the criminals' appearance in court, they were provided with a delicious lunch to quickly recover, with dishes including braised beef slices, beef bottles, mashed potatoes, white pagoda green beans, bread, white pagoda oil, and coffee.</p>
<p>Hasegawa, who once served as Secretary to Foreign Minister Matsuoka, predicted that if Matsuoka's treatment does not change, he will die before the end of the trial.</p>
<p>The defendants remained calm and composed when the indictment was read. Shigemitsu Aoi frequently shook his head, seemingly expressing dissatisfaction. The elderly Matsuoka Yosuke even fell asleep.</p>
<h3>Twenty American Lawyers: Defend Japanese War Criminals</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 2nd] The War Department announced today that it has selected twenty civilian lawyers to defend Japanese war criminals Tojo and the other twenty-seven, plus four military lawyers, to fly to Tokyo next week.</p>
<h3>Internal Conspirators in Iran: Rais Shoti Arrested</h3>
<p>Soviet Troops Withdrawing from Iranian Territory</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 3rd] The Daily Mail's Tehran correspondent reports that Rais Shoti, a powerful figure behind the scenes in the Iranian Royal Palace, was arrested yesterday morning under the orders of Iranian Prime Minister Sadana. Leftists say Rais Shoti had a conspiracy against the Prime Minister, which is the reason for the disagreement between the Iranian King and the Prime Minister. Political figures attach great importance to Rais Shoti's arrest, believing that it may cause major events.</p>
<p>[United Press, New York, 2nd] Reports from Iran say that Soviet troops are now stepping up their withdrawal in order to meet the promise to complete the withdrawal by May 6 and allow the Security Council to end the issue. This report has been confirmed by diplomatic figures here.</p>
<h3>Shidehara Recommends: Hatoyama to Form Cabinet; Requests MacArthur's Understanding</h3>
<p>[Reconstruction Daily News, Tokyo, 3rd] Shidehara entered the palace to meet the Japanese Emperor at 5:00 PM today, recommending Liberal Party leader Hatoyama as the new Prime Minister. At the same time, Shidehara or Yoshida visited MacArthur, requesting understanding on the recommendation of Hatoyama. In addition, the Liberal, Socialist, Cooperative, and Communist parties held a meeting this afternoon to discuss the policy agreement案 between the Liberal and Socialist parties, with only the Communist Party expressing opposition.</p>
<h3>Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference: Gloomy Prospects, Agreement on Treaties with Italy and Other Countries Appears Highly Unlikely</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] London, 3rd (Broadcast): The London Broadcasting Corporation's correspondent learned from reliable sources today that the hope for signing a treaty with Italy has become even dimmer. The American and Soviet foreign ministers met separately today with representatives of Yugoslavia and Italy to discuss the border issue between the two countries.</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 3rd] According to opinions expressed today by leading representatives attending the Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference, barring unforeseen developments, there is little hope that this conference will reach any agreement on any treaties. Officials from Britain, the United States, and France privately stated that while it is too early to predict that the conference will break down completely, after a week of discussions among the four foreign ministers, it appears that no progress has been made on any contentious issue. It is said that the US Secretary of State's request yesterday to amend the armistice terms for Italy and other countries indicates that the hope for reaching an agreement on treaties in the short term has rapidly faded.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 3rd] When the Foreign Ministers Conference resumes today, it will discuss the important issue of the Italian-Yugoslav border. The Deputy Prime Minister of Yugoslavia, Kardelj, leading a delegation of twenty-eight, has arrived in Paris. He will represent Yugoslavia in stating its position, and Italian Prime Minister De Gasperi will also speak on behalf of Italy.</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 2nd] Dissatisfied with the slow progress of the conference, the four foreign ministers have decided today to indefinitely suspend formal meetings and instead hold informal discussions daily. However, the first informal meeting this afternoon lasted only two and a half hours, and its results were no better than the formal meetings.</p>
<p>Dalmatian Islands: Issue of Affiliation Resolved</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 2nd] US Secretary of State Byrnes proposed today at the Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference that a committee be established in Italy to continue prosecuting war criminals after the treaty is signed. This proposal was blocked by Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov and did not pass. The four foreign ministers have designated the Adriatic island of Pelagosa to Yugoslavia and Pianosa Island to Italy, and stipulated that neither island may be fortified, and the fishing rights of the people of both countries should be respected. According to British sources, the Foreign Ministers Conference has also designated all the islands along the Dalmatian coast to Yugoslavia, but they must not be militarized. Meanwhile, at the request of France, a Franco-Italian border investigation team has reportedly arrived at the Col de Montgenèvre in the Alps. Also, a dispatch from Vienna reports that the German-speaking people of South Tyrol held demonstrations, protesting the Foreign Ministers Conference's failure to recognize Austria's claim to the area.</p>
<p>Byrnes Issues Warning: No Intention to Aid Defeated Nations</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 2nd] US Secretary of State Byrnes today called on the Allied nations to revise the treaty terms for Axis satellite states and warned the Soviet Union that the United States has no intention of allocating funds to aid defeated nations, so the Soviet Union may obtain reparations from the defeated nations. Byrnes issued this warning while the foreign ministers of the US, Soviet Union, Britain, and France were discussing the treaty with Italy. Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov said that the Soviet Union must receive 200 million yuan in reparations, with another 100 million yuan going to Yugoslavia and Greece. When the conference reached a complete impasse, Byrnes made this suggestion regarding revising the treaty conditions.</p>
<h3>Philippine President-Elect Announces Political Views</h3>
<p>Determined to Cooperate Sincerely with the United States, Roxas Will Travel to the US</p>
<p>[United Press, Manila, 2nd] Philippine President-elect Roxas announced his political views today, saying that he will cooperate closely with the United States in military and diplomatic affairs and encourage American investment in the Philippines. He also said that he hopes there will be no more wars in the future and that Philippine defense should be coordinated with American plans. Roxas will travel to the US by plane with US High Commissioner to the Philippines, McNutt, on the 8th of this month to discuss the complete independence of the Philippines.</p>
<h3>America's Top Criminals Stage Armed Rebellion in Prison, Most Guards in Danger</h3>
<p>[United Press, San Francisco, 2nd] Alcatraz Prison, located on an island in San Francisco Bay, houses America's most notorious murderers and robbers. The inmates suddenly staged an armed rebellion today. Prison official Johnston said that the inmates have machine guns and have locked a group of prison staff in various cells. Police authorities announced that as of 5:12 PM, the situation was still not under control, and firing continued inside the prison. Although prison officials claimed that no casualties had been reported, earlier reports indicated that two people had been injured. Patrol boats have surrounded the island. It is now known that one guard has been killed and five injured. The details of the rebellion are still unknown, but it is known that the lives of most of the guards are in extreme danger. No inmates have been able to escape from the island. Previously, two inmates attempted to escape, but have since disappeared and are presumed to have drowned.</p>
<h3>Britain Regulates Atomic Energy</h3>
<p>Bill Published, to be Submitted to Parliament Immediately</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 2nd] The government has just published an atomic energy control bill, which will be submitted to Parliament for discussion. The bill proposes granting unlimited powers to the Minister of Supply, who will be responsible for controlling the development of atomic energy, and stipulates various measures to ensure the secrecy of atomic energy. Anyone who discloses atomic energy secrets without permission will be considered a criminal and may be sentenced to imprisonment for more than five years or fined up to £500.</p>
<h3>Gypsum Car: Stronger than Steel</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Detroit, 5th] Renowned designer Stout displayed a lightweight gypsum car today. It is said that although the car body is not built with metal, it is stronger than steel. Stout predicted that the application of gypsum will fundamentally reform the automotive industry. The car body, except for the two doors, is molded from a single piece, and its density is ten times that of steel.</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Formally Opposes Four-Power 25-Year Treaty</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 3rd (Associated Press)] Moscow Radio attacked US Secretary of State Byrnes' proposal to establish a Four-Power 25-Year Treaty to guarantee the disarmament of Germany, saying that this was simply the United States refusing to fulfill its occupation forces' obligations. The broadcast explained for the first time why Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov opposed Byrnes' proposed draft at the Foreign Ministers Conference.</p>
<h3>Arab Higher Committee Rejects Palestine Investigation Report, Drafts Disobedience Plan, Sends Letter to British Prime Minister, Less Than an Ultimatum, Arab League Holds General Strike to Protest</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Jerusalem, 3rd] After a five-hour meeting yesterday to study the British-American investigation report on Palestine, the Arab Higher Committee appointed an emergency sub-committee to draft a disobedience plan to mobilize Arab youth and resources to serve the country. The sub-committee will organize public rallies throughout Palestine and raise funds for the Arab National Fund to promote the Arab national movement. The Arab Higher Committee has sent a protest letter to British Prime Minister Attlee and will send an Arab delegation to Aden and neighboring Arab countries to carry out activities.</p>
<p>[United Press, Jerusalem, 2nd] The Arab Higher Committee announced today that it has sent a letter to British Prime Minister Attlee, rejecting the recommendations of the Palestine problem investigation team, and said that the Arabs are prepared to defend themselves by all means and fight for national liberation again. This letter is just short of an ultimatum and was handed over to British High Commissioner for Palestine, Cunningham. The Committee has telegraphed to Arab countries calling for joint defense of Palestine, and said that it will study a plan to mobilize Arab youth to continue the struggle until death. Leading Arab figures told United Press reporters that they are currently drafting a memorandum to refute the investigation team's report point by point. The Arabs' overall response to the report has begun to materialize.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Cairo, 3rd] Arab countries will hold a general strike on May 10 to protest the British-American investigation report. Beirut will implement the general strike today, and all industries and businesses are at a standstill. It is reported that Lebanese officials and civilians are quite indignant about this report, and the Iraqi government has also lodged a serious protest with Britain and the United States.</p>
<p>Britain Requests US Military Assistance</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 3rd] Authoritative sources have learned that because both Arabs and Jews oppose the investigation report, the situation there is deteriorating. Britain will request additional US troops in the next few days to strengthen the existing garrison in Palestine. It is also learned that the British Foreign Secretary has sent a note to US Secretary of State Byrnes, who is currently in Paris, inquiring about what assistance the United States can provide to implement the recommendations in the report.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 2nd] A British Foreign Office spokesman said that whether Britain will transfer the mandate of Palestine to a United Nations agency will be decided after consultations with the United States.</p>
<p>Arab League Secretary-General Speaks</p>
<p>[United Press, Cairo, 2nd] Arab League Secretary-General Azzam told reporters tonight that the seven countries of the Arab League will certainly take unified action with the Palestinian Arabs, but we have not yet reached the stage of war. As for whether the Palestinian Arabs will seek Soviet assistance, any country that fights for survival will take all methods it deems beneficial.</p>
<p>British Military Commander Meets Cunningham</p>
<p>[Reuters, Haifa, 3rd] The new Commander-in-Chief of the Mediterranean, General Williams, arrived in Haifa yesterday aboard a British cruiser to visit Palestine. He flew to Jerusalem yesterday afternoon to meet with High Commissioner for Palestine, Cunningham.</p>
<h3>Fish that Slipped Through the Net: Kita, Terauchi, Prince Kan'in, etc., Will Likely Find it Difficult to Evade Justice in the End</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 2nd] The military gears and political buffers of Japan's war machine are now being accused as war criminals. Although the scope of the initial indictment only covers the outer layer, United Nations Chief Prosecutor Keenan stated that those not found on the list of defendants are not necessarily free from future liability. This shows that the Far East International Tribunal is proceeding step by step and does not want to involve too many people in the first trial. Judging from the current situation, the scope of this case will apparently extend to the Tanaka Memorial, so the number of people involved can be imagined. The fact that Emperor Hirohito of Japan was not included in the list of 28 defendants has been noted. At the same time, none of the major zaibatsu were included, which may be reserved for future investigation. General Doihara, who instigated the Mukden Incident, has been imprisoned and charged, but another general who committed similar atrocities in China has not been indicted. This person is Kita Seiichi, who is now captured by Soviet forces in Northeast China. The last commander-in-chief of the Japanese army in Southeast Asia, Terauchi Hisaichi, has also not been included. According to recent news, Terauchi is currently held by British forces and is seriously ill. General Okamura Yasutsugu, who led the last invasion war in China in 1944, has also not been mentioned. According to recent news, this person is still in China. Abe Nobuyuki, the prime minister at the beginning of the invasion of China and the last Governor-General of Korea, and Prince Kan'in, the former Chief of the General Staff, have not been included. In addition, Ayukawa Gisuke, the president of the Manchuria Heavy Industries Development Corporation, who used the zaibatsu to develop Manchurian resources to supply the military, is also yet to be indicted. In short, there are countless fish that have slipped through the net this time. However, since Tojo and others have already begun trial, those behind the scenes who were even more brutal will likely find it difficult to escape justice after a little time.</p>

<h3>The Sale of Enemy and Puppet Properties in the City Will Be Divided into Three Methods: Evaluated Sale, Public Auction, and Sale Through Company Organization. Original Residents Will Be Notified to Move Out on the Day of the Public Tender Announcement</h3>
<p>According to news from the Enemy and Puppet Property Disposal Bureau, the Broadway Mansions, towering on the banks of the Suzhou Creek, and the various important enemy and puppet properties received by the Bureau will be sold separately. The sales methods have been approved by the Review Committee and submitted to President Song for approval. The methods are divided into: (1) Evaluated sale, limited to real estate designated by the applicant and approved by the Executive Yuan. First, the Central Trust Bureau will evaluate the price, and after review by the Disposal Bureau, it will be submitted to the Review Committee for approval before being submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval. (2) Public auction, suitable for small and medium-sized real estate. The Central Trust Bureau will be entrusted to publish a tender announcement, and the detailed procedures will be determined separately. (3) Sale through company organization. Larger properties that are not easy to auction, such as apartments and whole lane houses, will first be evaluated by the Central Trust Bureau, reviewed by the Disposal Bureau, submitted to the Review Committee for review, and then submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval. Then, a company will be organized to solicit shares, and an incentive method will be stipulated whereby subscribing to a certain amount of shares will allow one to rent a certain type of house, so that the shares can be sold out as soon as possible, and the property will be sold. In the future, Broadway Mansions and other places will be sold in this way. As for the sales conditions: (1) The price must be paid in cash. (2) The property certificate must first be transferred to the name of the Enemy and Puppet Property Disposal Bureau of the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui districts, with the Central Trust Bureau as the representative. After the transaction is completed, it will be transferred to the purchaser. (3) The sold houses must be vacated in advance and handed over on the day of the transaction. The winning bidder should pay the full bid price within thirty days from the date of signing the pre-contract. For the auctioned enemy and puppet properties, the original residents must be notified to move out on the day of the public tender announcement, providing a forty-day timeframe, which is quite sufficient.</p>

<h3>Pan Gongzhan, Cheng Cangbo Host Tea Party to Welcome Wu Tiecheng; Expresses Sincere Joy at Revisiting Old Haunts; Travelled to Capital Last Night to Participate in Ceremony Returning to Capital</h3>
<p>Pan Gongzhan, advisor of this newspaper, and Cheng Cangbo, advisor of the Xinwen Bao newspaper, gathered prominent figures from the new open community in this city. Yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, they held a tea party at the YMCA on Xizang Road to welcome Wu Tiecheng, Secretary-General of the Central Party Headquarters. Over 70 people attended, including heads of various news agencies and guests. Pan Gongzhan gave a brief welcoming speech, stating, "Secretary-General Wu presided over the Central Party affairs and advised on major government policies during the war. News circles are eager to hear his wisdom on this visit to Shanghai. We are taking this opportunity to ask Mr. Wu to give us valuable instructions. If you have any questions regarding the domestic political situation, feel free to ask. Mr. Wu will be happy to answer." He then invited Secretary-General Wu to speak:</p>
<p>Two Different Impressions of Shanghai on This Visit</p>
<p>Wu rose amidst warm applause and delivered a speech in a solemn tone, saying, "I am a former public servant of Shanghai. After being away for nine years, I am sincerely pleased to see old friends again. The warm feelings are beyond words. This visit to Shanghai has given me two different impressions. First, although Shanghai was occupied for eight years, it did not suffer material destruction. Second, after the victory, the social conditions in the rear areas have completely changed compared to pre-war times. However, the social situation and lives of the citizens in Shanghai remain the same as before the war. One can hardly see any signs of eight years of war. If foreign friends from the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration only visit Shanghai, they will mistakenly believe that the impact of the war on China was very small.</p>
<p>Shanghai's Prosperity Depends on Overall Stability and Peace</p>
<p>Shanghai was occupied for eight years, and all pre-war systems and order were destroyed. After the recovery, it was able to recover quickly in a very short period of time. This is due to the enthusiastic assistance and cooperation of the citizens and the press of the whole city. However, if Shanghai wants to fully restore its pre-war prosperity, or even become more prosperous than before, it cannot rely solely on the efforts of the citizens of Shanghai. It must rely on the stability and improvement of the overall situation. I can assure you that the government is determined to make all concessions that are conducive to the realization of peace, unity, unification and democracy. Furthermore, I feel that there are two contradictory concepts in the current political situation: one is the demand for democracy, and the other is the struggle for territory. I believe that the two concepts of democracy and territory cannot coexist. If we want to realize democracy, we must give up the army and territory. Conversely, if we demand democracy on the one hand and engage in armed separatism, attacking cities and seizing land on the other hand, not only will democracy not be realized, but peace, unity, and unification will not be realized either."</p>
<p>Pan Gongzhan Proposes Suggestions Regarding Traitor's Defense</p>
<p>After Wu finished speaking, the whole place applauded warmly. Then, Cheng Zhonghang stood up to introduce Xie Renzhao, the Chief of Secret Police of the Zhengzhou Pacification Headquarters, to report on the recent situation in the Central Plains. Finally, Fang Zhizhou, President of the Philippine New China News Agency, and Pan Gongzhan and Cheng Zhonghang, successively raised inquiries and expressed their opinions. Pan said: Recently, in the trials of traitor cases in various courts, the traitors under trial have often defended themselves strongly in court and publicly published "confessions". Some newspapers have spared no space to publish them, giving the traitors the convenience of covering up their crimes, which is inappropriate and needs to be stopped. Wu expressed his agreement and hoped that the press would keep the records of the traitors' strong defense and confessions as brief as possible. Cheng advocated that the press should be responsible for clarifying the truth about the evolution of the current situation, so as to correct public opinion, so that ambitious people cannot use the means of confusing public opinion to achieve their illegal and disruptive purposes. Wu also expressed his approval. The tea party ended at 6:30 PM. Secretary-General Wu came to Shanghai this time purely for a medical examination. He took the night train back to Beijing last night to participate in the grand ceremony of returning the capital to the central region.</p>
<h3>Shortage of Wharf and Warehouse Space; American Shipping Company Notifies Customers to Pick Up Goods at Shipside</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] Recently, international shipping vessels have transported a large number of relief supplies to China. The American President Lines, acting as agent for the U.S. War Shipping Administration, has allocated four ships specifically for Shanghai, Southeast Asia, and Siam to transport rice. The first ship, the Ford Huehermer, arrived in port the day before yesterday. After the cargo is unloaded, it is scheduled to sail to Southeast Asia on the 5th. The other three ships are on their way to Shanghai. It is also reported that the American President Lines has more than 20 ships in Shanghai. Due to the lack of wharf and warehouse space, it is inconvenient to unload goods, which delays the ship schedule. To remedy this, the company has notified customers to pick up goods at shipside. In addition, it is reported that the Jardine Matheson &amp; Co.'s Southeast Asia route will be extended to Guangzhou. The new ship Fuzhou has been scheduled to sail. The ship will arrive in Shanghai from Hong Kong this week.</p>
<h3>Rickshaw Driver Cheated and Robbed of Car, Thrown Out by Bandits</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] At approximately 9:00 PM the night before last, several bandits, posing as customers, cheated and stole a car numbered 20294 from the Zhonghua Rongji Car Company on Marlane Road. The rickshaw driver, Chen Guoxiang, was blindfolded midway, and 10,000 yuan in legal tender, $59 in American banknotes, a pocket watch, and a pair of leather shoes were stolen from his pocket. The bandits drove the car themselves to the vicinity of Baoding Road and Youheng Road, where they threw Chen out, and the car sped eastward. At 3:00 AM yesterday morning, Chen finally rushed to the police station to report the crime and request an investigation.</p>
<h3>Re-discussion of Methods for Exempting American Soldiers from Feast Tax</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] The Shanghai office of the U.S. Army Headquarters in China, in order to show preferential treatment to American soldiers, previously requested exemption from the feast tax. The Finance Bureau and the U.S. Army Headquarters jointly decided on a method, issuing a type of "exemption certificate" for use by various military personnel. After implementation, it was discovered that there were omissions in the signatures on the certificates, and the usage methods were also subject to further discussion. For example: (1) The food and drink expenses per certificate should not exceed 10,000 yuan, and (2) only one invoice should be attached to each certificate, to show restrictions and facilitate auditing. It is reported that the American military side agreed to the second method, but said that this matter should be noted by the restaurants. As for the limit of 10,000 yuan per certificate, they believe that the amount is too small and plan to request a relaxation, which has not yet been resolved.</p>
<h3>Continued Trial of Yuasa This Afternoon</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Military Tribunal of the First Garrison District will retry Japanese war criminal Yuasa Torakichi this afternoon. According to the Shanghai Military Tribunal, there are currently more than 80 war criminal suspects detained in the court. They have all been thoroughly investigated by the prosecutor. However, among them, there are 36 people who were mistakenly detained due to having the same name. It has been confirmed that they are not suspected of being war criminals. Yesterday, they were sent to the Prisoner of War Management Office to be repatriated.</p>
<h3>Xiao Xiefen Comes to Shanghai to Assist in Trying Traitors; Lawyers Demand to Meet with Clients, Otherwise They Will Refuse to Defend the Traitors</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] Since a large number of traitors were escorted to the Shanghai Prison on Ward Road, the work of the Provisional Court of the High Court attached to the prison has become tense. However, the trial staff, including Court President Liu Yugui, Judge Cao Jun, Qiu Huanjin, and Cai Jin, are not enough to share the workload. Therefore, the Ministry of Judicial Administration has sent Court President Xiao to Shanghai to assist in the trial of traitors. The new criminal court on the third floor is being actively arranged.</p>
<p>Since the High Court Provisional Court began hearing traitor cases, defense lawyers have been suffering because they cannot meet with their clients before the trial. Therefore, they recently submitted a document to the High Court, requesting a more flexible method. The reason is that other courts besides Shanghai do not have such regulations. The Criminal Procedure Law also clearly stipulates that defendants and lawyers have the right to meet. The regulations on punishing traitors and dealing with traitors also do not prohibit meetings. Since the court allows traitors the right to hire lawyers to defend them, it should allow lawyers to have the convenience of collecting favorable evidence. Some lawyers said that if this regulation is not abolished, they will refuse to defend the traitors in the future.</p>
<h3>Burden of Addiction; Female Performer Regains Freedom, Famous Doctor Summoned Again</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] Zheng Bingru, a top actress at the Tianchan Stage, was arrested by the police on the evening of the 29th of last month, immediately after finishing her performance, and temporarily detained in the General Bureau detention center because she was addicted to opium and did not register with the police station. It is reported that the actress Zheng was temporarily released on bail yesterday. In addition, the famous doctor Ding Jikun was addicted to drugs and was recently summoned by the police station for detention. Later, because he was running for municipal councilor, he was temporarily bailed out by powerful people. It is now known that the Municipal Police Department summoned him to the bureau again yesterday and sent him to the Municipal Hospital for examination.</p>
<h3>Commemoration Meetings Held Today by All Circles for the May Fourth Movement Festival</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] Today is the anniversary of the "May Fourth" Movement, and all schools in the city have a day off.

<h3>Celebrating the National Government's Return to the Capital; Municipal Museum Opens Today; Displays One-Fifth of Salvaged Cultural Relics</h3>
<p>Opening the organizational outline of the Shanghai Municipal Museum, the first article clarifies its mission, stating that it is to promote Chinese culture, advocate scientific research, disseminate modern knowledge, and assist social education with appropriate displays and explanations.</p>
<p>Because of the importance of its mission, the museum began preparations in December last year. After several negotiations, it managed to recover two-thirds of the cultural relics stolen by the enemy and puppets from the previous museum. Most of them have now been sorted out. Due to the limited funds and equipment, one-fifth of the recovered cultural relics have been arranged in the first exhibition room, which is on the third floor of No. 961, North Hengbangqiao, North Sichuan Road. Now, in order to celebrate the return of the National Government to the capital, it will be open for exhibition from today.</p>
<p>At the invitation of Mr. Jiang Dayi, director of the art section of the museum, the reporter had the opportunity to "take a sneak peek" yesterday. Although the first exhibition room is just one large, straight room, the items on display include fossils, stone tools, oracle bones, bronzes, bronze mirrors, ancient coins, pottery, and Tang porcelain.</p>
<p>Fossil Collection</p>
<p>Most of them are various animal fossils excavated in Zhoukoudian (the place where Peking Man fossils were discovered). The patterns on the fish fossils are clearly discernible. In addition, there are fossils of Li's pig, De's water buffalo, and swollen bone deer. The stone tool category has collected many stone knives, stone spears, stone axes, stone chisels, and stone sickles from the Neolithic Age, most of which were unearthed in the southeastern region. The museum has also collected a lot of tortoise shells and cattle bones engraved with the earliest Chinese characters.</p>
<p>Bronze Category</p>
<p>More of them are fine products, dating back to the Yin, Zhou, and Han dynasties. There are cooking utensils such as li, ding, and zeng; washing utensils such as yi, pan, and lian; a pot for timing; musical instruments such as he, duo, and ling; drinking utensils such as gu, jue, and ; weapons such as ge, mao, jian, and ; Among them, the most valuable is a collection of bronzes collected by Wu Dacheng, a Jinshi scholar of the Qing Dynasty, especially the Chengguozhonggui he obtained in Baoji, which he considered the happiest event of his life. There is also a pair of Scythian small bronze deer. Scythia refers to the ancient regions north of the Black Sea and near the Salt Sea or northern and central Asia, and is an important material for studying bronze culture. In addition, the collection of spring coins includes copper shells, Qi knives, cloth, and ordinary copper coins. The collection of bronze mirrors ranges from the Warring States period to the Ming and Qing dynasties, which can be said to be rich.</p>
<p>Burial Pottery Figurines</p>
<p>There is a pair of barbarian figurines. Although they are from the Tang Dynasty, they have high noses, sunken eyes, full beards, foreign hats and clothes, carrying bedding and carrying water bottles, a look of seeking a living in China, which is very interesting. The postures of the dancing girl figurines, dwarf figurines, and prostrate figurines are lifelike, and there are even groups of Ming utensils in the homes of high officials, including a full set of ceremonial guards during the patrol, which can be called a grand sight. In terms of Tang porcelain, there are three types of ordinary utensils, small utensils, and toys made in Qionglai kiln and Liulichang outside the East Gate of Chengdu. They are small and exquisite and can be appreciated!</p>
<p>Mr. Jiang pointed out and explained the treasures one by one. Although the reporter spent more than an hour browsing, he still felt like he was rushing through the flowers. I hope there will be an opportunity to come and appreciate these treasures that are not usually easy to see. At the same time, I hope that the citizens of Shanghai will take the opportunity to visit the museum during its opening period to broaden their horizons! (Canglong)</p>
<h3>Wu Nigao (Traitor Wu Songgao) Regrets But It's Too Late; One Wrong Thought Back Then; Heartbroken Even Now; Detailed Account of Colluding with the Enemy</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] When Chen Gongbo, the traitor, was the puppet mayor of Shanghai, his secretary-general, Wu Nigao, was the "red man" of Shanghai. Later, he was promoted to the puppet Minister of Justice and came to Shanghai to inspect the Tilanqiao Shanghai Prison, full of prestige. But yesterday, he entered the court with his head down in the guise of a prisoner, under the gaze of more than 200 spectators. He was wearing a blue cloth gown, shiny black leather shoes, and black-rimmed glasses. His face was quite ruddy, and his newly shaved hair was already gray. His attitude was very calm. He confessed to all the points of the crime in the indictment filed by Prosecutor Xia, but he flatly denied the phrase "willing to collude with the enemy." He said: "One wrong thought back then still feels extremely painful today. In the year when the Pacific War broke out, I was still in the United States. I was originally preparing to return to the accompanying capital with Minister Guo Taiqi, but Secretary-General Cheng Zhonghang of the Supervisory Yuan strongly invited me to Hong Kong to take over as the editor-in-chief of the Sing Tao Daily. Two months later,</p>
<p>Hong Kong fell and fled to Kowloon</p>
<p>and lived in a hotel with Lin Kanghou and others, and was eventually caught by the Japanese army; he was detained for three months before being sent to Shanghai in three batches. Although there was a home in Shanghai, the economy was tight, and I was a scholar who was useless in everything. I couldn't do business and couldn't go to the mainland. In order to negotiate the real estate forcibly occupied by the enemy, I went to Nanjing once and was surrounded by many friends of the puppet organization. After returning to Shanghai, I got an empty name of "Minister of the Diplomatic Department". In short, I went to Hong Kong for friends at the beginning, and as a result, I encountered this misfortune. I also blame myself for not having the courage to break the bad environment and solve the economic difficulties. Today, to the motherland, to the judges, to the news reporters and compatriots present,</p>
<p>I feel extremely ashamed</p>
<p>and extremely heartbroken. Court President Liu Yugui asked: "Which friends surrounded you when you went to Nanjing?" Wu first hesitated to answer, and after the presiding judge repeatedly questioned him, he finally said: "It was Wang Jingwei, Chen Gongbo, and Zhou Fohai." Asked: "What was the situation when you took over the concession?" He replied: "The takeover of the concession was a local event. For example, the Japanese concession in Hankou and the French concession in Tianjin were handed over by the local mayor and consul-general. The situation in Shanghai was slightly different. It was handed over by the representatives of the Bureau of Industry and the puppet mayor Chen Gongbo at that time." Asked: "Was it not the puppet Ministry of Foreign Affairs that sent you to take over?" Wu Nigao smiled bitterly when he answered. Tao: "No, no, I was sent to inspect the takeover situation." Asked: "What did you do during your tenure as the director of the First District Office of the puppet Shanghai Municipal Government?" He replied: "There are two important tasks, namely the unification of organization and the unification of wages." Asked: "What about during your tenure as the secretary-general of the puppet municipal government?" Answer: "After the concession was taken over, the Shanghai municipality still used the original political districts of the concession</p>
<p>Divided into one and eight districts</p>
<p>I became the secretary-general to design how to merge the one and eight districts and implement them." Asked: "How did you become the puppet Minister of Justice later?" He replied: "In January of the 34th year of the Republic of China, Zhou Fohai, the chief of the puppet Shanghai, asked me to take over the Ministry of Justice. Forced by his strong invitation, I agreed. I was only in office for two months, but I had negotiated with the Japanese Embassy and released more than 280 central staff members detained in Zhenjiang and Wuxi at the end of March." Asked: "Did you participate in the revision of new laws during your tenure as the puppet Minister of Justice?" He replied: "No, the special court was directly under the puppet National Government and was not under my jurisdiction. What I used were the laws of the Republic of China." At this point, Prosecutor Xia stood up and declared that Wu Nigao had also served as a member of the Puppet Material Control Review Committee, and had published absurd remarks such as "willing to use the heart of death to seek the realization of co-prosperity" and shouting "Greater East Asia" and "Down with Britain and the United States" during his tenure as the secretary-general of the Puppet Municipal Government. That is, at that time</p>
<p>For the New China Daily</p>
<p>etc. to testify. Wu Nigao read the newspaper, his eyebrows were tightly frowned, and his face was gloomy. He only said softly: "This is just official stereotyped writing!" The defendant's defense lawyer, He Xiaoyuan, was hired by Wu Nigao's sister, and presented several documents in court that were beneficial to the defendant. The presiding judge ordered a retrial at a later date. The defendant requested to talk with his defense lawyer and family members, and he was allowed to meet with them in the judicial police room. Because news reporters gathered around, Wu Nigao spoke in English, saying that his case was only a political issue, not a personality issue. His crimes should be judged by the people, and the judge cannot use the stereotyped speeches that he followed at that time as evidence of his crimes. His nephews and nieces did not speak to him, and Wu Nigao only instructed them to "talk on Sunday" before being escorted back under the urging of the bailiffs.</p>
<p>Check</p>
<p>Wu Nigao, a native of Suzhou, is 48 years old this year and lives at No. 221, Baille Road. He was originally the director of the International Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of our National Government and was sent to Geneva to be the legal commissioner of the Chinese delegation to the League of Nations. In May of the 32nd year of the Republic of China, he served as the minister of the puppet Ministry of Foreign Affairs and a member of the puppet Committee for the Abolition of Extraterritoriality. In November of the same year, he was transferred to the chief secretary of the First District Office of the puppet Shanghai Municipality. In April of the 33rd year, he was promoted to the director of the First District Office of the puppet Shanghai Municipality and also served as the secretary-general of the puppet Shanghai Municipal Government. In February of the 34th year, he was promoted to the Minister of the puppet Ministry of Justice until the victory. The prosecutor argued that Wu had been favored by the country for a long time and should have loyally served the country, but he was willing to collude with the enemy, change his loyalty to seek glory, and shamelessly serve the enemy. He was indeed guilty and should be punished according to Article 2, Paragraph 1, Item 1 of the Regulations on Punishing Traitors.</p>

<h3>Rice Truck Rush on Yongbin Highway Binyang Prisoners Mass Jailbreak</h3>
<p>— Special correspondent Liang Xiaozhong from Guilin on the 25th [Our Own Report]</p>
<p>A most terrifying statistic: "Guangxi's grain reserves can only last until April this year. What happens after April? We dare not even imagine it." For almost half a year, the sky has been perpetually dominated by a cruel sun, scorching the fields of farmers in all directions. The transplanting of rice seedlings has been missed, the planting of corn has been missed, maize, buckwheat... all have been missed. Usually at this time, adults and children would already be biting into tender, sweet corn, but this year they haven't even sown the seeds. Although some places occasionally experience a few fleeting showers to alleviate the distress, they don't even saturate the soil. What good are they? To this day, the entire Guangxi is characterized by one word: "Drought."</p>
<p>Staring Anxiously at Flour Coupons</p>
<p>People have finished gnawing on grass roots and tree bark, and relief flour has finally arrived. Each person gets twelve ounces, but they must first fill out a form, submit it to the distribution office for review, and then it is issued. During the distribution of flour, who knows how many corrupt individuals manipulated the scales, trying to skim off the top, only to be beaten by the starving people. There was also a poignant interlude during the flour distribution: One family in the entire county (a total of five people) received flour coupons, but they were all too weak to get out of bed and go to the village office to collect it. Everyone just stared anxiously at the flour coupons. In the end, it was their daughter-in-law, who had just returned from her mother's house after eating a meal, who picked up the flour coupons and collected the flour. There was also a less serious but still noteworthy incident: the farmers in the south, who are not accustomed to eating flour, received flour in the Guinan area. Many people didn't know what to do with it, so they mixed it with a little water, fried it in a pan, and swallowed it piece by piece. Having something to eat is already joyful enough. Who cares what it tastes like?</p>
<p>Rice Truck Robbery on the Yongbin Highway</p>
<p>Chairman Huang returned from the Second Plenary Session and, after witnessing this tragic scene, was indeed filled with boundless anxiety. He couldn't obtain funds, couldn't borrow money, and, apart from relying solely on the relief distribution office, he was simply at a loss. Fortunately, fellow countrymen are, after all, fellow countrymen, and everyone still harbors boundless fraternal love. Relief movements have been launched in various places, with donations of money, rice, charity performances, and charity matches, raising a total of several million dollars. Speaking of which, it's just a drop in the bucket. But that drop of water is so sweet! On the one hand, there is a strict ban on grain exports (the provincial government once requested permission from the British to import 20,000 bags of Siamese rice from Hong Kong and Guangdong to Guangxi, but it was not granted, while large quantities of grain were being transported out of Wuzhou batch by batch in military vehicles under armed protection). Two merchant trucks, under the name of the Security Command, attempted to transport 4,000 catties of rice for export, but were robbed clean by starving people on the Yongbin Highway. The Suzhou starving people looted rice shops, the Guangxi starving people looted rice trucks, an uncanny coincidence, with ominous signs everywhere. Let me tell you another joke that's not a joke:</p>
<p>Liquor Ban Fails Because Taxes are Important</p>
<p>The liquor ban was urgently issued by the provincial government to various localities. When the ban was not thorough, public opinion scolded, senators scolded, and ordinary people also scolded: Don't waste grain on distilling alcohol! If it could be truly banned, statistics show that the province's food supply could save more than one-tenth. In this way, it can support for at least half a month more. However, unfortunately, the tax bureau urgently "requested instructions" from the Ministry of Finance, because liquor tax is important! Such a large amount of income, how can it be easily abolished? Liquor cannot be banned! Liquor cannot be banned! As a result, the sealed brewing equipment all reappeared, and the descendants of Du Kang were all delighted. Those collecting money were smug, although they also stipulated things like "rice and wheat are not allowed to be used for brewing," which is just a ghost of a regulation to deceive children! Those executing the orders suffered heavy restrictions. What to do?</p>
<p>Selling Body and Soul to Survive</p>
<p>Liquor and sex have always been inseparable, and what is pitiful is that within the word "sex" lies an unknown amount of blood and tears! In the disaster areas, female compatriots, from fourteen-year-old girls to women in their thirties and forties, under the pressure of hunger and for the lives of their parents, children, and themselves, wandered from the countryside to the streets in the thousands, selling their bodies and souls with tears in their eyes. In the Xing'an county area, ten catties of rice can bring "true ecstasy," and ten catties of millet can buy indulgence in lust. Those who can bring rice home to support their families are your wives. Taking the money, taking the rice, they will still thank you profusely, taking it home to save the lives of the old and young. As for virtuous women who throw themselves into the fire pit and fall into brothels, the number is truly unknown. According to statistics from so-called "special checkpoints" (妓女的集中營), many "new goods" join every night, providing those who have sucked their fill of blood to vent their bestial desires and compete for laughter. Ah, how bitter! The so-called "free flying swallows" in hotels and alleys are also everywhere. Guangxi, which has always been known for its simplicity, has suddenly become like this. Isn't it all for survival?</p>
<p>Pitying Robbers for Looting Thin Gruel</p>
<p>There was a news story in the newspaper that was simply unprecedented. It is now transcribed below: "In Changsheng Village, Zhongdu County, Huang Li's house was broken into one night by several robbers who threatened her with guns, ordering her to remain silent. They then crowded into the kitchen, ate their fill of thin gruel, and left with a whoop." The robbers painstakingly schemed, but only managed to steal a meal of thin gruel, which is truly enough to make one pity the robbers. However, this is also enough to make those in the metropolis who spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on food and drink while living a decadent life deeply reflect!</p>
<p>Since hunger is like a prairie fire, expanding its domain county by county, the current environment has created a situation where there are thieves everywhere, and every thief is fierce. In the past, during the period of village cleansing, there was still some fear, but now it has simply become blatant, with groups of people shouting and roaming everywhere. There are places where bandits are rampant, even two or three hundred people, setting up light machine guns, guarding the highway entrances, and even robbing seven cars in a row. No one seems to care. Whether in villages or towns, everyone lives in fear. There is also a matter worthy of hidden concern. The border area between Yue (Guangdong) and Gui (Guangxi) has always been a refuge for thieves, and now some "People's Revolutionary Army" have appeared, systematically recruiting troops. This is truly a future trouble.</p>
<p>Prisoner Jailbreak Kills Guards</p>
<p>With so many thieves, catching thieves is particularly diligent. One village cleansing is not enough, so another village cleansing is carried out. As a result, none of the prisons in the province are not "filled with distinguished guests." The inability to quickly conclude cases has given this group of prisoners, a mix of good and bad, a great deal of suffering. The prison, like a fiery cage, is filled with people. Not only is there no place to sleep, but even sitting must be done in shifts. Coupled with the hot weather and the prevalence of epidemics, many people die every day, and without coffins, they are wrapped in rotten mats and thrown out. The prison is not much different from hell. As a result, it led to a province-wide jailbreak riot. Hundreds of prisoners in Binyang County Prison, in the middle of a stormy night, shouted madly, killed the guards with stones, and rushed out the door. Stone bullets flew everywhere, and as a result, the prisoners mostly escaped. The warden himself was imprisoned, and the real bandit returned to the marshes to poison the local area.</p>
<p>200,000 Workers Build Railroad</p>
<p>Amidst the sounds of disaster, there is, after all, one piece of good news: the north-south railway trunk line from Zhanjiang (Guangzhou Bay) through Guixian, Guangxi, to connect with the Qian-Gui Railway and directly to Lanzhou, Gansu, has now begun surveying. It is expected to be completed by the end of next year. The construction of this section of the railway is a massive project, requiring more than 200,000 workers. It is said that it will use the method of work-for-relief to recruit workers for construction, and the famine problem can be considered as solved.</p>
<p>Famine is not limited to grain, and politics also feels an infinite emptiness. Chairman Huang Xuchu, who has been in power for nearly twenty years, is said to be quite tired. Relaxing in the gardens and leisurely in the South Mountains is originally happier than the boundless sea of officialdom, but the people of Guangxi still need a hardworking leader, and everyone will not want him to leave suddenly. Recently, the news that Huang Shaohong has returned to Guangxi to take charge has also spread quite vigorously.</p>
<p>Also, Guangxi University, which has been troubled by enough disturbances, has reorganized its personnel and major affairs since President Chen Jianxi arrived at the school, set a deadline for students to return to school, and formally relocated the school to Guilin. Everything has returned to normal. The children who could not return to Butterfly Mountain in Wuzhou are arriving in Guilin batch by batch to register and prepare for classes and exams. Once the garrison stationed in the Institute of Technology moves out, the school will officially begin classes.</p>
<p>Diphtheria Returns, Many Epidemics</p>
<p>The abnormal weather has made diseases like winged tigers, snatching countless lives. Guilin is currently experiencing recurring fever and diphtheria, and other epidemics are also prevalent everywhere. Thinking of the terrible cholera outbreak last year, everyone is worried again.</p>
<p>Hardships upon hardships, hardships upon hardships, no one pities, and no one helps. The people of Guangxi are just as Turgenev said: "The soul burns in loneliness, and the flame goes out in loneliness." (April 25)</p>
<p>Infants born here can learn the entire school education system without leaving Yubu.</p>
<h3>Huaxiba Academic Paradise</h3>
<p>— Zhou Yangquan from Chengdu on the 2nd [Our Own Report]</p>
<p>If anyone wants to ask about the value of Huaxiba, then I can first introduce a popular saying here: "Huaxiba is paradise, Shapingba is a question, and Guluba is hell."</p>
<p>Huaxiba—it is truly an enviable place. She lies virgin-like in the tranquil southeast of Rongcheng, between the old Nanmen and Fuxingmen, and is itself a flat, hill-less dam, with a Jin River tied behind it. How can one describe her beauty and charm?</p>
<p>Eternal Spring</p>
<p>Huaxiba has one characteristic: it is always spring. Even in the severe winter, one can still see verdant evergreen trees. How much more so in the spring air, when trees, flowers, and plants flourish? "When you walk into the place from the noisy city," it will naturally make you exhale a stuffy breath. Seeing the palace-style buildings, appearing and disappearing in the lush trees, with carved beams and painted rafters, majestic and magnificent, mixing the beauty of Chinese and Western architecture, with green grass like carpets and hundreds of flowers blooming, makes you feel that the environment is too beautiful.</p>
<p>Front Dam and Back Dam</p>
<p>Huaxiba is divided into the front dam and the back dam; all the essence is mostly concentrated in the front dam. The back dam is relatively deserted and barren. Entering the front dam from the East Side Gate, the first building is the West China University Library. The library has a vast collection of books, which is the warehouse of spiritual food for thousands of students. Students from the five universities study there all day long, especially during exam periods, when it is even more bustling. The second floor of the library houses a museum, with rich collections of cultural relics and treasures from the West China area, making it one of the leading museums in western China. The Institute of Comparative Culture and the book and film exhibition are even more distinctive. Further ahead is the Hefei College, which is the location of the College of Science and the chapel. The gymnasium accompanies it on the rear side, which is a venue for regular gatherings and events. All large-scale assemblies, lectures, and theatrical performances are held there. Opposite the Hefei College is the West China University Office, which is the brain of West China University and the location of the administrative center. The Wande Gate is the office and classroom of Ginling Women's College, with Minde Building as its center. Yenching University has the College of Science as its center. As for the biology building, the chemistry building, the College of Education, and other buildings, they are mostly shared by the five universities. Cheeloo is located on the north side of Xiaotianzhu Street, and as long as you cross a road, although separated, they are still united. The student commune and the youth center are places where students regularly socialize and interact, but unfortunately, the capacity is too small.</p>
<p>Complete Education</p>
<p>Huaxiba is dominated by West China Union University, and the other four universities, Ginling, Ginling Women's College, Cheeloo, and Yenching, are all guests from afar after the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War. Soon, these guests will all return to their hometowns. Ginling and Ginling Women's College have decided to say goodbye and return in mid-month. Therefore, people who like to worry are worried that the dam will soon be lonely. This is the general situation of university education. As for secondary schools, there are five or six middle schools, including West China Union Middle School, Zherong, Jinzhong, Gaoqi, Jichuan, and the Provincial Leather School. Primary schools include: Diwei, Nantai, Canada, and the Municipal Central School, and other four primary schools. In terms of early childhood education, there are: West China University Nursery, Ginling Women's College Affiliated Nursery, and several kindergartens. As for the advanced academic research institutes, there are: Ginling University Institute of Cultural Studies, Institute of Frontier Problems, Ginling University Agricultural Economics, Horticulture, Economics, and other research institutes. Someone said: An infant born in Huaxiba can receive a complete school education without taking a step. We in our country really need more places like Huaxiba.</p>
<p>Huaxiba is not only a concentration of schools but also a source of some of the best hospitals in the country. Here, there are the West China University New Hospital, Sanatorium, Leprosarium, and the West China University Dental Hospital, with dentistry being the most prestigious in the country.</p>
<p>Morning and Dusk</p>
<p>There are two best times of day in the dam, namely morning and dusk: When the morning sun first rises, the entire dam is immersed in ten thousand golden rays. The singing of orioles can be heard everywhere in the forest, and the morning mist rises from the ground. It is truly harmonious and overflowing with tenderness. As for sunset, couples, walking back and forth in the trees and flowers, singing and chanting happily, or even dancing, they and she are unrestrictedly in nature.</p>
<p>Ten Scenes of Batou</p>
<p>Here, we also need to introduce some of the ten scenes on the dam:</p>
<p>(1) "Playing the Lute to a Cow" - that is the music room of Ginling Women's College. All day long, the sound of the lute is gentle and melodious, but how can the neighboring cows of the dairy farm appreciate it?</p>
<p>(2) "Moonlight over the Bow Bridge" - whenever the sun hangs high in the sky, looking down at the reflection of the moon in the creek from the several curved bridges is so poetic!</p>
<p>(3) "Phantom of the Bell Tower" - that bell tower on the dam is the god of timekeeping for the entire dam. It stands on the dam like a giant, faithfully reporting the time to the people on the dam month after month, day and night.</p>
<p>(4) "Jade Maiden Like a Shuttle" - that is the epitome in front of the new hospital. Seeing the girls wearing clean medical clothes, coming in and out, those are angels descended from heaven!</p>
<p>(5) "Flower Street and Willow Lane" - that is the scene on Xiaonan Road;</p>
<p>(6) "Police on Duty" - that is the loyal photography of "gentlemen" in front of the women's dormitory.</p>
<p>Lakeside of Love</p>
<p>(7) "Lakeside of Love" - whenever the sun sets, couples sitting and talking by the Lake of Love are the most envied.</p>
<p>(8) "Willow Waves by the Creek" - that is the most beautiful scenic line on the dam. The flat playground is surrounded by streams and weeping willows, which will remind people of the Su Causeway and Bai Causeway on the West Lake.</p>
<p>(9) "Department Store" - describes the rich state of the museum's exhibits, which make people feel overwhelmed.</p>
<p>(10) "North and South Poles" - says that in the past, the West China University Library stipulated that men and women should sit separately and not interact with each other, but now, like "Broken Bridge and Remnant Snow", you can no longer see "Broken Bridge", and you can no longer see "Remnant Snow". Similarly, men and women in the library not only do not separate, but even sit tightly together.</p>
<p>Love Murder Story</p>
<p>If you really want to know Huaxiba, there are two more spine-chilling stories that must be told to you: One is that as early as eight or nine years ago, a corpse that had been cut into eight pieces was found in the lake next to the bell tower. He was stabbed to death by his rival in love and thrown into the lake, but was finally discovered by a lotus root picker. The other was five or six years ago, when a concubine of a famous warlord fell in love with a handsome "gentleman". Whenever the night was quiet, she would come to meet the "gentleman" in secret, but the warlord found out about it. As a result, the "gentleman" and the concubine became a pair of dying birds under the warlord's butcher knife. Of course, there are more than just these two scandalous stories on the dam, but these are just the most exciting and popular.</p>
<h3>Nanchang Tidbits</h3>
<p>— Jiang Zhaoran from Nanchang on the 20th [Our Own Report]</p>
<p>Chen Benhou, the head of the telecommunications department of the provincial government's construction department, has a limited income. With white rice costing more than 20,000 yuan per picul and other necessities "racing to rise" with white rice, he really couldn't support himself and his wife. Then he received a letter from his parents urging him to send living expenses, which was as urgent as a blazing fire. So, like in a play, department head Chen went crazy, to the point of hitting and scolding people he met. He was sent to the hospital by a friend, but "a mental illness still needs a mental cure," and the hospital couldn't cure his mental illness. Not long before this tragedy occurred, there was a sad history of Liu Chen's death from starvation while eating tree bark and grass roots. The reporter believes that the dead are already gone, and this "madness" must not be allowed to continue!</p>
<h3>Newspapers Suffer Hardships Schools Face Difficulties</h3>
<p>There are seven newspaper offices: "Huaguang", "Minguo", "Dazhong", "Xinshang", "Lixing", "Shengbao", and "Zhongguo Xinbao". There are also "Minbao" and "Jiebao" that are being prepared for reprinting. The current sales volume of each newspaper: the most is about 8,000 copies, and the least is about 3,000 copies. According to a survey: a certain newspaper loses nearly two million yuan per month on average, not including the hard work of the newspaper people. The hardship of newspaper offices is evident!</p>
<p>"Compulsory education" originally meant forcing school-age children to attend school and receive education. Here, "compulsory" is used on paying the "desk and chair fee", which is truly absurd.</p>
<h3>Sending Away the Mother-in-Law to Welcome the Living Buddha</h3>
<p>Wang Lingji, who succeeded Cao Haolin as the master of Jiangxi, is not only a military and politician but also has a considerable research on Buddhism. He is also a religious believer. If Cao is called "Mother-in-law" then Wang is the "living Buddha." The people of Jiangxi are very fortunate because the "Mother-in-law" left and the "Living Buddha" came. The reporter on behalf of the 30 million Gan people, begs under the care of Chairman Wang, that Jiangxi can quickly achieve a "great human state."</p>
<h3>Securing the Lifeline of Western Zhejiang Residents: Challenging the Tide</h3>
<p>— Huzhou Dispatch, April 26th, by Ding Dong</p>
<p>The fertile plains of western Zhejiang are the treasure trove of Zhejiang Province. "Above, there is paradise; below, there are Suzhou and Hangzhou." Needless to say, Hangzhou is such a wonderful place. Jiaxing, Jiashan, Chang'an, and Xiashi are all excellent locations in Zhejiang Province. Haining's watermelons are shipped to Shanghai every year, relieving Shanghai residents from the oppressive summer heat. While ice cream is enjoyable, it simply doesn't offer the same refreshing coolness as watermelon. The Hangzhou and Jiaxing regions of western Zhejiang, along the eastern coastline, rely solely on a dike for protection. Five to six million people live here, because it has always been affluent, paying the heaviest grain taxes in Zhejiang Province, and producing fish, rice, silk, and satin to supply people's consumption. But now, this dike, stretching five to six hundred *li* (approx. 250-300km) and protecting five to six million people, is nearing collapse due to both human and natural erosion.</p>
<p>The Importance of Jinshanwei</p>
<p>The starting point of Zhejiang Province's seawall is Jinshanwei, which borders Jiangsu Province. If we aren't forgetful, we'll recall that eight years ago, the enemy landed here, encircling Shanghai's rear. As a result, the Shanghai defenders could only retreat. Some sections of the seawall around Jinshanwei have already collapsed, perhaps due to wartime damage. However, looking at the present and recalling the past, you'll realize that these seawalls are intimately related to us. In peacetime, the seawall is the protection of farmland; in wartime, it is our fortress.</p>
<p>The Seawall Stretches Five to Six Hundred *Li*</p>
<p>The seawall project is extremely arduous, stretching five to six hundred *li*, and includes stone dikes, brushwood dikes, culverts, etc. The stone dike is the most critical part. The surging waves erode the dike's bank, and long strips of bluestone can crack completely. If the craftsmen skimp on materials in the mortar joints between the stones, it's easy for the waves to break through and cause collapse. The brushwood dike is made of a mixture of bamboo and wood, with fir pilings and woven brushwood mats, topped with earth and stone. The rivers of western Zhejiang are numerous and branch out, with culverts guiding the small rivers into the East China Sea. When the tide rises, seawater can flow back into the culverts and into the small rivers. Standing on the seawall, the sea breeze brings a salty taste into your nose and skin. On one side is the blue sea, on the other is the lush green rice paddies, but when the blue seawater rushes into the rice paddies, the rice turns yellow and dies. Beside the rice paddies are the houses and homes of the people of western Zhejiang, their lives and property!</p>
<p>Skimping on Materials: Impending Disaster</p>
<p>This spring, a total of over 1,900 meters of the seawall collapsed, according to official reports. The reporter did not measure it, but compared to the entire five to six hundred *li*, it is only one percent. However, this is a seawall, and there cannot be any gaps. Once there is a gap, seawater will rush in, and everything the farmers have will be ruined. It is said that the spring tide is smaller than the autumn tide, so when autumn arrives and the autumn tide rises sharply, you will realize how serious the disaster is. Those in charge of the seawall project are skimping on materials and not following construction regulations. The earthwork is sloppy, and the stonework is even more careless. One bag of cement is used like it's a cowhide bag (referring to the small amount of cement), and the flour that should be issued is reduced by 20 or 30 percent, or else it's moldy flour. What has already been repaired is done haphazardly, as if only a layer of paste was applied, which will dissolve when soaked in seawater. The parts that have not been repaired are already leaning precariously. With disaster impending, we can no longer ignore this. The seawall that was built in the past, entirely with lime, did not collapse; now, the seawall that uses cement has already collapsed. We must investigate and pursue these malpractices in the project. Be careful: do not sell the flour intended for the seawall in the city to make bread, and do not use the cement intended for the seawall to build private Western-style houses!</p>
<p>Urgent and Critical Project</p>
<p>The seawall is divided into different sections, which has been passed down for thousands of years. Each section's project has its own characteristics. Although the reporter does not want to do specialized research, this long seawall now lacks manpower, financial resources, and materials such as bamboo, wood, cement, and stone. There are only one or two thousand workers. As for materials, they are not even enough to patch up the holes. Needless to say, financial resources are lacking. Even if there are financial resources, we must be wary of someone embezzling them. No one repaired it for eight years, and no one has seriously done it in the eight months after the victory. If it really collapses, you push me, I push you, what will it become? This is today's seawall, the lifeline of five to six million people in western Zhejiang!</p>

After the initial completion, the committee will then engage in the editing of secondary school textbooks, with the aim of having all textbooks compiled and printed in full after the summer vacation of this year, so as to be applied in various schools at the beginning of the autumn semester.</p>

<h3>Northeast University to Resume Classes in Shenyang in Autumn; President Zang Qifang Flies to Chongqing for Preparation</h3>
<p>[Dahua News Agency, Beiping Air Mail] Northeast University, after the September 18th Incident when the Japanese invaders launched an unprovoked attack, moved from Shenyang to Beiping, Kaifeng, Santai and other places successively, experiencing hardships. Since the victory of the War of Resistance and the recovery of Shenyang by the National Army, the school is now preparing to move back to its old school site in Shenyang, which it had been separated from for fourteen years. The president of the school, Zang Qifang, flew to Chongqing a few days ago to prepare for the relocation. According to alumni of the school in Beiping: There are currently about 500 students at Northeast University in Santai, only over a hundred of whom are from Northeast China, and the rest are from Sichuan. After the relocation, the Sichuan students can transfer to other schools. The most problematic issue for the relocation is the transportation for the families of various professors, because the railway recovery will take time, so they can only travel from Santai to Chongqing, take a boat east, pass through Shanghai, and directly travel by sea from Yingkou to Shenyang. It is learned that they can start from Santai in early May, and classes will definitely be held in Shenyang at the beginning of the autumn semester.</p>

<h3>Allocation Price Recovers to 1.6 Million; Gold and Banknotes are Settled; Unofficial Discount is Still High, and Monetary Tightness Remains</h3>
<p>The (Chinese) National Gold Savings Certificates (NGSC) continued to weaken yesterday. The allocation price of the Central Bank of China (CBC) was further lowered to 1.6 million. However, it still felt sluggish in the middle. The general mentality is that this allocation price is unlikely to fall again, based on past situations, and it rebounded slightly on dips. It was found that the morning opening was still flat. Ordinary head stocks were still extremely tight after the opening, and the atmosphere of panic has not been alleviated at all. It gradually retreated from 1.63 million to below the 1.6 million mark, and then showed a revolving trend. The CBC allocated more than 60 strips to peers and more than 10 strips to silver shops, at a price of 1.6 million. It once dropped to 1.575 million after 10 o'clock. Since then, the monetary situation has gradually stabilized. The allocation price of the Bank of China (BOOC) has not decreased. Investors bought low and covered, and rebounded to around 1.61 million at noon. In the afternoon, the monetary situation was generally loosened after small banks adjusted 400 to 500 million. It continued to be slightly stable. As a result, the closing was not much different from the previous closing. Jewelry was 173,000, silver was 1,700, silver dollars rose slightly, and the unofficial discount was around 20% in the morning, and finally about 16% to 18%.</p>
<p>Someone absorbed US dollars on dips, and some gold sellers also bought it for arbitrage. Arbitrage settled at around 715 yuan. The morning opening was around 2,230 yuan. It fell to around 2,180 yuan in the middle. After entering the market, it gradually improved and showed slight activity, rising to around the morning opening price. The same was true in the afternoon. As a result, the closing was similar to the previous closing. Hong Kong notes were initially affected by the general trend, but later stabilized because exchange rates were tight. The Hong Kong telegraphic transfer rate was 445 yuan, and the Robi rate was 545 yuan, all of which were traded. The listed US exchange rate was still flat, and designated banks still traded at around 2,050 yuan.</p>
<h3>Yarn Prices Continue to Fall</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market continued to trend downward. Small and medium-sized yarn and 16-count yarn merchants scrambled to sell, and the price fell by 20,000 to 40,000 again. Fine yarn double strands were particularly sluggish. Only 20-count Gold Double Horse yarn was 20,000 higher than yesterday, because the Hai'e customs will close tomorrow, and the Cantonese gangs had to reluctantly take it in in order to catch the ship out of the port. I, however, think it will be difficult to stabilize its price. At noon, Fangjian continued to post prices as usual. There seemed to be 29 kinds of yarn threads, which seemed to be 20,000 to 140,000 lower than the previous period. The 42-count Blue Phoenix thread depreciated the most by 140,000. However, yarn merchants and manufacturers were not very enthusiastic in purchasing. In addition, there were three kinds of coarse yarn and seven kinds of fine thread that were tendered for purchase. Only Yongxing Yarn Shop bought one kind of 32-count Yanghe double-strand thread, and the price was 1.57 million yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the New York American cotton telegraphic report rose to 16 points. The recent American gold was 27.56, the forward was 27.67, and the Mittlein spot was 28.14. The local cotton trading was stagnant. Manufacturers lowered prices, and goods holders were unwilling to sell, making it difficult for both parties to reach a negotiation.</p>
<h3>Silk is Gradually Stabilizing</h3>
<p>After continuous declines, the silk market seemed to have entered the end game yesterday. However, rayon was still 40,000 to 50,000 yuan shorter than the previous day. However, silk factories have already started work, and actual sales will definitely move. Moreover, the allocation price is almost the same as the market price, so it will not tend to fall again in the near future. Yesterday, Guangren rayon from Tianqiao No. 120 opened at 1.52 million yuan in the morning and closed at 1.47 million yuan. Factory and foreign bank goods were not yet open for business. The price of silk for weaving was the same as the previous day, and silk goods were also still not strong. There was not much change throughout the day, but transactions were very deserted.</p>
<h3>The Tea Market is Trending Towards Stability</h3>
<p>Shaoxing Zhuji new fried green tea, since its debut a few days ago, has been pushed up by holders' active thinking, so the asking price was finally squeezed and raised compared to the previous day. As for green teas of Baozhong and Zhulan grades, the demand from Tianjin and Suzhou is good, and the people's minds are solidifying, and the bottom plate is stable. The prospects look tight. In addition, for the special-extracted Gongxi tea that is specially sold to Mumbai, India, peers have been frequently favored due to the favorable price. It is said that after absorption, it is planned to wait for export.</p>
<h3>Woolen Fabric Transactions are Quiet</h3>
<p>Woolen fabric transactions, both retail and wholesale, have been low recently. Although dark-colored goods are slightly cheaper, no one is interested. For summer goods, most customers have already purchased comfortably. Street buyers adhere to the principle of selling and adding as they go. Generally, local households with good environments have already purchased, cut, and made them. Ordinary salary earners are all too expensive and unable to purchase. Customers from all over the country know that foreign goods will be shipped in soon, so they are unwilling to buy in a hurry. Therefore, transactions are increasingly tired. Peers, in view of the lack of business interest, mostly make lower-end goods and fewer high-end goods. Although interest rates have decreased, they can still be maintained. Therefore, there are those who lend at interest rates to maintain expenses, which has created a situation where woolen fabric transactions have become increasingly worse recently.</p>
<h3>The Coal Market Continues to Soften</h3>
<p>The arrival of white coal has increased sharply, but the decline has not improved. Market prices have fallen again. Yesterday, another 3,000 tons of Macbeth coal medium blocks were shipped from Haiphong and are now unloaded in McGan Road Xingzhan warehouse. It is said that the price will be between 250,000 yuan and 300,000 yuan. The supply and demand of Shanghai spot anthracite is still flat, and the market price is also stable. Due to the extremely tight monetary conditions, peers in Pudong warehouse receipts are dumping, and the market continues to soften.</p>

<h3>Public Bond Market: Major Players Cover Short Positions, Stock Fluctuations Slight</h3>
<p>Yesterday, major players in the public bond market covered their short positions, reversing course and instantly changing market sentiment. Tongbing bonds opened in the morning at 5,200 yuan, once breaking through the 5,000 yuan level, reaching around 4,950 yuan. When selling pressure eased slightly, major bond market players took the opportunity to cover short positions. With the activity of two or three major players, the price rebounded to 5,900 yuan at noon, resulting in a recovery of 500 yuan compared to the previous close. Class A and B bonds rose 400 yuan, Class D bonds rose 300 yuan, and Class E bonds rose 50 yuan. The atmosphere of panic in the Chinese stock market dissipated slightly, with considerable resistance at lower prices, but the situation has stabilized. There was mostly a steady process throughout the half-day, with frequent short-distance advances and retreats. At low prices, Yong Yarn was 5,050 yuan, American Asia was 4,150 yuan, and Jingfu was 415 yuan. The market regained stability at noon, with slight fluctuations in the previously popular stocks compared to the previous closing price. Unpopular stocks saw declines.

<h3>Coconut Oil Declines, Industrial Oils Remain Sluggish</h3>
<p>The outlets for industrial oils and fats in Shanghai are mostly for the manufacture of soaps and candles. Recently, soap sales have decreased, and the stock of rosin is very high. The stock of tallow is also high, and imports are also pouring in. Coconut oil once disappeared completely, with prices reaching 320,000 yuan per dan. Soap factories were mostly unable to use it.

<h3>Foreign Company Registration Deadline Extended to the End of June</h3>
<p>[United States Information Service, Washington, 2nd] The Department of Commerce announced yesterday that the Chinese government, in response to repeated requests from foreign businesses, has extended the deadline for foreign businesses to register in China to the end of June 1946. The original deadline was the end of March, but due to transportation delays between China and foreign countries, it was difficult to obtain the necessary documents by the original deadline. Before the end of June 1946, all foreign businesses operating in China must complete registration procedures in order to be allowed to continue operating. After the end of June, if any foreign business wishes to conduct business in China, it must apply for registration when establishing an office in China, and may only begin operations after approval has been granted.</p>
<h3>Rice Prices Seem to Have Elasticity: Down the Day Before, Up Again Yesterday</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the rice market was buoyed by reports of rising prices in the interior, and market sentiment turned firm. The situation in the early market was very tight. However, sales in retail stores were sluggish, and the market softened at noon. As a result, prices rose slightly by 400 to 500 yuan compared to yesterday. Flour was weak in the morning but rebounded in the afternoon. However, the first batch of Australian wheat flour has arrived in Shanghai and is being unloaded, and it should be available on the market soon. There are also reports that foreign rice is being negotiated for import, so food prices should not rise excessively for the time being. Soybean digestion was very weak, and prices gradually decreased by 500 to 1,000 yuan. Raw peanuts saw balanced trading. Sesame seed sales were not good, and prices fell by 2,000 yuan. Broad beans saw little trading and sales. Cottonseed cake remained downstream. The supply of oil continued to arrive, and stores' appetite collapsed, falling another 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Red beans were neither praised nor disgraced. Wheat bran remained oversupplied and gradually declined, falling another 200 to 300 yuan. Bean cake market transactions were scarce, and factory supply continued, falling by 600 to 700 yuan.

The types and amounts of each are as follows: White rice 3,077, Thin rice 833, Early rice 612, Yangxian 17, Dubi 530, Baiyuan 105, Yinyuan 70.</p>
<h3>Taiwan's Gasoline Production: 26,000 Gallons</h3>
<p>Taiwan's oil is produced in various parts of Tainan. During the Japanese occupation, there were six companies and refineries, the largest of which were the three factories under the jurisdiction of the Japanese Navy. They were also the most severely damaged during the war. After our personnel took over, they are actively repairing and resuming operations. The other three factories, Imperial Oil, Japan Oil, and Taiwan Development Chemical, have partially resumed operations after reorganization. The monthly production is only 26,000 gallons of gasoline and 200,000 gallons of alcohol. However, the monthly demand for cars, both public and private, in the province is 850,000 gallons, so there is a strong hope for American gasoline imports.</p>
<h3>US Cotton Estimate: 33.3 Million Bales</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Bombay, 3rd] The official fourth estimate of cotton production for 1945-46 is 3,361,000 bales, and the planted area is 15,440,000 acres, a decrease of 5% and 2% respectively compared to last year's revised estimates.</p>
<h3>No Exports of Gallnuts: Uses, Origin, and Price</h3>
<p>Before the war, the export volume of gallnuts was comparable to that of rosin. This material is mostly used abroad as a raw material for manufacturing pigments. Therefore, when exported, the whole gallnuts are ground into powder, called "poufen." Currently, due to weak prices abroad, it is only sold domestically. Leather factories in the city use it for direct tanning. Its origin is Hubei, Sichuan, Hunan, Guizhou, etc., with Sichuan and Laohekou producing the most. The recent price usually fluctuates between 60,000 and 80,000 yuan. Before exports improve, it is only held for domestic sales, and there is no sign of improvement in the short term.</p>

<h3>A Writer with a Clear Conscience</h3>
<p>— Jin Chun</p>
<p>Goethe, a great poet and historical novelist of 19th-century England, wrote these words in the year he died:</p>
<p>"I am one of the most prolific writers of the time, but I have several things that comfort me: in all my works, I have never written a sentence that interferes with the beliefs of others; I have never written anything that slanders the claims of others. When I am dying in my sickbed in the future, I will not think of a work from the past that makes me feel ashamed, and I will not feel relieved until I find a way to delete it."</p>
<p>Goethe died on September 22, 1832. This was from a letter he wrote to the historian Lockhart on May 10th of that year.</p>
<p>A writer is called great partly because of his works and partly because of his character. It is not easy for a writer to be great and produce a lot of work, and it is even more difficult to be strict with his writing. A great writer does not necessarily have to cater to readers, but he must be worthy of readers. He should not only be happy when writing, but also have a clear conscience after writing.</p>
<p>Scott is a good example for today's writers.</p>
<h3>Review of "A Concise Course in Social History"</h3>
<p>— Ping Fan</p>
<p>By Zheng Chumin, published by Shenghuo Bookstore</p>
<p>The question that this book seeks to answer is "How is society constituted? And how does it change?" In the author's preface, he says: "I have very carefully accepted the correct answer to this question and the method of investigation for this question, and step by step unfolded a faithful description of the process of social construction and the process of social change. In other words, I have strived to stand in the scientific camp before I began to strive for a scientific description of the process of social evolution." This kind of "scientific work" is "really necessary in the domestic publishing world at present" because "the backwardness of Chinese academics is causing the shallow thinking of scholars to be popular. Not only is the understanding of the construction of various methods too difficult, but also the hope that everything and every phenomenon will focus on the overall examination, that is, to make an overall examination of the inevitable dialectical process of things, is already too much beyond the vision and the limits of the living requirements of the scholars."</p>
<p>But I think that (1) the author himself is unscientific in his method of observing social history, (2) his explanation of the constitution of society is mechanical, and (3) his explanation of the process of social evolution is anti-dialectical. I will now briefly explain these three points.</p>
<p>First, from the perspective of historical materialism, all social superstructures and all social evolution processes are based on material and are determined by economic forces. This is correct, and no one can deny it. But we feel that this view is not enough. For example, human life is built on the organic action of many cells. This is true, but the organic activity of many cells is not human life. Human social life is impossible without an economic foundation, but it is also impossible with only an economic foundation. If there are only a few cornerstones without building a building, it will not become a building. If there is only economic power and no other power, it will not become a society. If we want to base ourselves on "overall examination," although we admit that matter is a necessary condition for spirit, we can never use the method of explaining matter to explain spiritual phenomena. The biggest premise of the scientific method is to be based on objective facts. If, in objective facts, matter and spirit have different intrinsic relationships and different natures (although there is a generative relationship and an organic connection of shared fate between the two), then we cannot confuse them. We should find out the characteristics of both sides, and then use the method that matches these "objective facts" to observe it, analyze it, and explain it. If we only rely on subjective beliefs and use the same key to open all kinds of different locks," these doors will never be opened.</p>
<p>Second, speaking of the constitution of society, as the author said, in addition to the economic base, there are also two factors, namely politics and ideology. In fact, he also forgot two factors, one is the educational power that allows communication between individuals, and the other is the social emotion expressed by literature and art. I think that materialist historians have not given equal importance to the emotional aspect of life as they have given to other aspects of life. They believe that human life is completely based on rational judgment. In fact, emotion is an equally important aspect of life. Another point that I think the author has not clearly explained is the relationship between economics, politics, and ideology. They each have their own special missions, which cannot be explained clearly by words such as "production" and "labor." I think that economics is the material basis of social life, politics is the organizational force of social life, and ideology is the planning and control mechanism of social life. The author seems to have insufficient understanding in this regard.</p>
<p>Third, in terms of social evolution, the author believes that the differences between different stages are entirely due to the economic structure, and different superstructures arise from the differences in the economic structure. However, sometimes changes in society occur in the ideological aspect, and then the material aspect of society is changed based on this ideology. There are many such examples. For example, the Soviet revolution first had Marx's historical materialism. The Chinese revolution is based on Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People. To this day, there is still the ideal of the Three Principles of the People, but a society that fully realizes the Three Principles of the People has not been fully realized. Speaking of China's social reform, our thinking has been influenced by Western culture, and we are deeply dissatisfied with the status quo, and then we gradually improve, even adopting revolutionary methods. This is what is called "getting the wind first," and what is called "the wise." Also, in each stage, we believe that each has its own different characteristics, and these characteristics cannot be completely encompassed by the two words "materialism."</p>
<p>The content of the whole book is "concise," which is still worthy of the name. A detailed critique will be written later.</p>

<h3>Random Musings on Elementary School National Language and Common Sense Textbook, Volume 1</h3>
<p>— Huang Yide</p>
<p>My youngest daughter is continuing her studies in the first grade this year. I pay close attention to my children's homework, asking them to report on what they've learned each day, especially with my first-grade daughter, spending quite a bit of effort on the pronunciation, explanation, and writing of new characters.</p>
<p>The textbook my daughter is using is the first volume of the Elementary School National Language and Common Sense Textbook, a standard textbook approved by the Ministry of Education. Last night, I thoroughly reviewed it from beginning to end and felt that there were many aspects worth discussing. I am now writing down my opinions below, hoping for correction from those more knowledgeable. Because this is the official textbook for elementary school students, we might as well take a more serious look at it.</p>
<p>(I)</p>
<p>The text of the first lesson is: "Come, come, come, come to school."</p>
<p>The text of the third lesson is: "Go, go, go, let's all go play. Playing is really fun."</p>
<p>I believe that the tone of these two lessons does not quite match the actual living situation of children. Children's going to school is passive, while their playing is mostly active. Starting from home to school is clearly "going," and the picture below the text shows three children walking toward school. If a picture could be drawn of a few children standing at the school gate, greeting the students coming to school, it would be more appropriate. Therefore, my idea is that the text of the first lesson should be changed to "Go, go, go, go to school." Furthermore, on page six of the third lesson, there is the sentence "I want to go to school every day," so wouldn't this change connect the tone before and after?</p>
<p>When children are playing, they often like to call out to their companions, so I think the text of the third lesson should be changed to "Come, come, come, let's all come to play, playing is really fun." The tone of "Let's all go play" seems to imply a motive for playing, but not yet participating in the game, but the picture below the text already shows very fun playing, which seems to commit the fault of "the text not matching the picture."</p>
<p>(II)</p>
<p>The text of the fourth lesson is: "There is a national flag on the new book, with a blue sky, white sun, and a wholly red earth. The national flag is really beautiful."</p>
<p>The editor uses the two words "new book," one intention being to review these two new characters, which I think is not very appropriate: Children have many opportunities to see the national flag. When children read this lesson, it might be the Victory Commemoration Day on "September 3rd," so there are real, beautiful national flags with a blue sky, white sun, and a wholly red earth everywhere on the streets and in schools. Why put the "national flag" on the "new book"? Moreover, the picture below the text is completely a black and white drawing, without the "blue and red" colors, so how can children read the text and say, "The national flag is really beautiful"?</p>
<p>Therefore, my idea is to have three ways to change the two sentences, "There is a national flag on the new book": In accordance with item five of the "Editorial Guidelines," which says, "The arrangement of teaching materials in this book pays attention to the seasons and environment, so as to facilitate teaching," if this lesson is taught on the Victory Commemoration Day, it is better to change it to "National flags are hung on the streets." Adding the two new characters "street hanging" would not be a big problem.</p>
<p>If this lesson and the fifth lesson are moved to around the tenth lesson, then it can be changed to "On National Day, hang the national flag."</p>
<p>The text of the fifth lesson is: "National flag, national flag, I love you, I respect you, I salute you." The picture below is of raising the national flag. I am very satisfied with the picture and text of the fifth lesson. In order to avoid using too many new characters, and to connect and coordinate with the pictures and text of the fifth lesson, I think it is better to change it to "Raise the national flag in the school," which is most suitable. I wonder what the editor thinks?</p>
<p>(III)</p>
<p>My daughter has now read up to the twelfth lesson. The text is: "Dad feeds the ducklings. The ducklings grow up. He sells the ducks and buys a lamb. Dad [feeds] the lamb. The lamb grows up. He sells the lamb and buys a calf. Dad [feeds] the calf. The calf grows up. He teaches it to learn to plow."</p>
<p>Low-level textbooks should be simple and clear, so that children can read them smoothly, which is the principle. This text violates this principle. My daughter is in the first grade of the elementary school department of the Shenmei Girls' Middle School on North Zhejiang Road, and her grades are relatively good. The school has named her deputy class leader. This time, she even scored an average of over ninety points in the national common sense exam, which can be considered an excellent student, but she not only cannot understand this text clearly but also is not interested in it, saying that "this lesson is tangled like climbing vines."</p>
<p>In fact, whether it is possible to exchange ducks for sheep and sheep for cattle, let's not talk about it. To tell a joke, this dad originally had a pair of oxen for plowing the fields, which would have been fine, otherwise, from ducklings to calves, and then feeding the calves into large oxen, and then having the oxen plow the fields, wouldn't that dad's fields have been barren long ago?</p>
<p>(IV)</p>
<p>On pages twenty-eighth, forty-seventh: "Snowflakes fly, fly all over the sky. Sister says they look like sugar. Brother says they look like salt. Little brother, take a taste. Not sweet, not salty."</p>
<p>On page forty-eighth of the same lesson: "One piece, one piece, another piece. Two pieces, three pieces, four or five pieces. Six pieces, seven pieces, eight or nine pieces. They fly to the water surface and disappear."</p>
<p>In terms of the depth of the text and the interest in reading, I think page forty-seventh and page forty-eighth should exchange places. Although both are talking about snow, page forty-eighth is a riddle about snow. First, teach children to guess the riddle of snow, and then read the text on page forty-seventh about snow, which will be much more interesting for children to read, and also more convenient in the teaching sequence!</p>
<p>(V)</p>
<p>As for other things, such as the forced filler of the seventeenth lesson, and the twentieth lesson not conforming to the "seasons and environment," I will not go into detail.</p>
<p>However, I want to state clearly that I am not nitpicking, because this is a standard reader for children nationwide, and everyone expressing their opinions is hoping that the next edition can be even more perfect.</p>

<h3>Writers as Doctors</h3>
<p>— Dongxin</p>
<p>Writers can be divided into two types: one writes for the sake of writing, and the other writes for the sake of the topic. — Awabone Kahua</p>
<p>Literature is like medicine. Incompetent writers are just like quack doctors: some have knowledge but lack skill; others are merely glib and superficial. — Colton</p>
<p>When a writer talks about their own work, it is just like a loving mother talking about her own children, both being somewhat confused and unclear. — Disraeli</p>
<p>People always like to praise writers of previous generations. This is not because writers are admired after death, but because competition and infighting are so fierce when writers are alive that no one is willing to praise anyone. — Hobbes</p>
<p>The pen of a genius writer is the most powerful. What it achieves often exceeds what the writer intended to write at the time. — Heine</p>
