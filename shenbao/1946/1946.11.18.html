<p>〔中央社南京十七日電〕本年三月問行政院公布之進出口貿易暫行辦法及附表，現經行政院加以修正，於十七日呈奉國民政府指令照准。</p>

<p>自去秋戰事結束之後，我國復員最急切之工作，首爲獲取物資，以補充八年內之匱乏。此項需要之物資，已有大量進口商貨，加以聯總運入之物資，及與美國商定移轉之太平洋各島剩餘物資等，故政府已有充分物資供給之把握，對於物資供應問題，已可認爲圓滿。</p>
<p>此項情形，使政府能以全力注意於建設問題。現在時機業已成熟，政府應即於所決定之一般經濟政策之下，推行選擇准許進口之辦法，即將本年三月一日所公佈之進出口貿易暫行辦法之輸入許可制度，推廣應用於一切進口物品。</p>
<p>所有進口物品，按其性質分類。凡屬國內生產事業所需要之必須物品及原料，以及其他具有正當用途之物資，得予以優先進口。又對於各項器材之輸拉，應予以便利。但非需要品之輸入，將不予鼓勵。</p>
<p>此項修正進出口貿易暫行辦法，本日衣已呈奉核準公佈施行，足以扶助國內生產事業，及促進經濟建設，雖屬臨時措施，但在我國經濟建設過程中，爲極重要之步驟也。</p>
<p>輸拉管委會在滬成立執委會今將制定細則</p>
<p>職入臨時管理委員會之組織人選，依修正進出口貿易暫行辦法規定，主任委員應爲宋子文，副主任委員應爲翁文灝，委員應爲兪鴻鈞，王雲五，兪大維，白崇禧，貝祖詒，錢昌照，霍樹寳等。至該會執行委員會之親織人選，及施行細則之擬訂，宋院長十七日中午有電致中央銀行總裁貝祖詒，指示三點：（一）茲依照修正進出口貿易暫行辦法第七條之規定，指定貝祖詒爲輸入臨時管理委員會執行委員會主任委員，李榦，張福運，林維英，陳長桐爲委員，請即日通知組織。（二）派李榦爲輸入限額分配處處長，張福運爲輸入品管理處處長，陳長桐爲執行委員會秘書處長。（三）茲授權執行委員會，依據該辦法第十七條之規定，制定有關之施行細則及程序，暨公吿等事項，以利該辦法之實施，請即査照辦理。</p>
<p>輸入臨時管理委員會之辦公處所，設立於上海中央銀行內。該會定於今日上午八時卅分起，正式開始辦公，該會執行委員會，並定於今日下午，召開首次會議，制定修正進出口貿易章程之施行細則及程序。制定後之全部條文，將於十九日由委員會公布之。</p>

<p>〔本報南十七日電〕宋子文十七日於記者招待席上稱，我國生產事業除聯總有一部份機器運來外，日本方面賠償我國之工廠，亦將有多量機器運來，對於此類機器，將來應如何利用，政府方面正研究辦法中。深盼各方能組織起來，對籌集資金與興建廠房諸問題，能有所貢獻。</p>

<p>〔法國新聞社南京十七日電」民主同盟發言人羅隆基十七日談稱：民盟將拒絕接受改組後的國府委員會所留予彼等之席次，因民盟感覺此一步驟無補於由國之統一與和平，一如與民盟之參加國大無補於統一。調解活動因國大之召開而停頓，但余已正式通知政府，謂余將留京或留上海附近，以便機會到來再作調解之努力。至於政府與民主社會黨進行談判，要求該黨參加國大，詳情迄未知悉。該黨如與民盟脫輻而參加國大，對於民盟之力量，並無重大影響，因民盟僅有民主社會黨員廿人，但該然如與民盟一致，則在原則上將獲得國大位置四十席，因此一席數即政府要求其與民盟分裂而畀予之席數也。</p>

<h3>破壞之後力求建設　察哈爾在新生中　恢復電力爲當前急務</h3>
<p>〔本報北平十七日電〕記者二度赴察，十六日自張垣歸來，見察省正自破壞中力求建設，（一）張家口路局一個月間已修復八輛殘破車頭，六列車皮，附屬機廠已恢復，月修三台機車，三十輛客貨車，七百餘工人返廠工作者已達五百餘，在七十歲老機務段長領導下，工作情緒甚佳。（二）行政部門：十二戰區之行政會已逐漸將政務移交，漸具規模之省政府，省幹部訓練班二十日開學，馮前主席所委縣長，除懷來。涿縣外，殆皆未到任，傳長官已另派員視事，還鄕隊皆解散，嚴禁報復，土地問題除按中央公布辦法辦理外，進一步之適應現地辦法尙未擬成，但原則已決定，除高於二五減租者減低爲「二五」標準外，其已按習慣而規定低於「二五」標準者，不許增加。明年春耕前，必須完全決定以工代振，而從事於收拾殘廠與修路之工人的九千名，每人每日給法幣三千至四千。（三）經濟部門：察省主要電源之下花園電廠，原有六萬四千瓩發電設備，殘餘機器可拼凑成一發電一萬瓩機，資源委員會已査訖，如快二個月可修復，張垣現修復」發電機，可供一千燈燭及一部電磨，商民尙不能用，自動電話毀後，現有二百餘手搖機供軍政用，不久可增至近千數，而分一部與商民，原可日出百箱之捲烟廠，大部機器可用，但因無電力而不能開工，其他工廠亦然，故恢復電力爲當前急務。一般商業因人口漸增，轉趨繁榮，銀根仍緊，流通市面之法幣約三十億，故物價上漲不多，較諸收復時的增十分之一二，銀號只一家（中共在時爲二十餘家皆有中共股份），中央銀行尙未開業。用煤主要來源爲下花園之民營實興煤礦（中共曾入股四分之一），現每日出煤二百噸（原可出煤千噸）。此外，有龐家　小礦，日出三四十噸，工電未恢復，則尙可對付。（四）文敎部門：小學已開學者全省有三十餘校，最近可恢復中學師範各一所，專門以上學校尙無望恢復，中小學敎科書已自平運到，經營者爲中華·商務二家。此外，已組成文物保管會，並將成立民敎館·圖書館，出南口移張之中學進修班，將擴充收容五百人。</p>

<h3>中美農衣團任務完成　全部報告將公佈　美方團員分別來滬返國</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京十六日電〕中美農業技術合作團，現已完成任務，美方團員於日前謁蔣主席及拜會我有關部會首長後，已分別赴滬，轉返美國。該團美國團員於六月二十七日抵滬，與我國團員集合，即行開始工作，逗留京滬四週，其後分成若干小組，出發視察主要農產區域實况，旅行時間共十一週，計經十五省，於上月六日始完成考察工作，返京後，即開始草擬報吿，該項報吿共長四十餘頁，由該團中美兩方團員經六週之時間，共同商討而成，已分別送呈中美兩國政府參考，及我政府之採擇，並將出兩政府共同的定公佈。</p>
<p>美團長談</p>
<p>美方團長赫契生表示，完善之農業計劃，對於中國繁榮之關係綦深，凡直接影響於農業及三萬萬農民者，即間接影響全國人民之幸福，蓋農業亦不僅爲全國人民衣食住行之所需，且爲工業之重要原料，更爲外匯之主要來源，戰前中國農產品之輸出額，其値佔外銷總額百分之七十，可爲明徵，此項外匯，中國政府可用於購置工業器械，運輸器械，及發展工業所必須之特種器材，中國若能應用最近科學方法，以改進土壞作物，牲畜及農其等，必可增進農業生產，及農民福利，同時並深信如中國改進佃租制度農業貸款及農產運銷辦法，亦可改善農民之經濟狀况，赫氏謂：我國過去十數年以來，對植物種籽之改良已有很好基礎，惟對動物方面，則尙無基礎，中國人民食物，不獨在量上食飽已足，並應質量並重，蔬菜水菓肉類，與米麥之同樣重要。赫氏希望我國能設立兩三所設備最完善之農業硏究院，我國農業技術人缺乏，若僅靠聘請外國專家技術人員，及送國內農業學生往國外留學，並不是唯一辦法，因爲我國大學農科畢業學生，到國外所進者，仍爲硏究院，但若能在國內有完備之農業研究院，在了解國內情形熟識環境之下，其所獲定必較在不同環境而又對本國國情不相宜狀况下爲大。</p>
<p>建議要點</p>
<p>該團感於目前我國農民環境之艱困，對解決之完善計劃與合理組織，已擬具報吿，呈送中美兩國政府採擇施行。茲將其建議擇載如下：（一）對於全國農業敎育硏究及推廣之聯　，應由農林部與敎育部切實合作，所有農林部設在首都之各實騐所，及在全國九個中心區所設之農科大學，農事試騐塲，及農業推廣分局，均應密切聯繫，至省將各級農業機構，均須擴充其事業，並加強其工作。（二）對於低利農貸之晉遍供給農產運銷之改進，若干區城佃租制度之改善，土地測量登記與報價之實施，本年國民政府已頒布之土地法，應嚴格執行。（三）設立一國家農業銀行，統籌全國農業金融，以應農業上之需要。（四）在農林部設置農業一管制德分局，辦理動植物檢疫，優產品分級檢騐及取締攙假等工作。（五）中國有限之農業資源，不能供應現時不斷增加之人口壓迫，此種困難，即使將來農工業發達，仍難解決，政府應早謀解決之對策。（六）對於化學肥料工廠之建設，農田水利之發展，作物牲畜品之改進，及其病蟲害之防治森林之培植與保護，禽畜之增產，農情報告及物價調査等，均應特加注意。（七）對於主要外銷農產品，因受外匯比率及國內運費上漲與利息增高之影響，而停止出口者，應速謀有效之對策，鼓勵其輸出。上項建議之完成，固非一蹴可就，但該團認爲應就所有人才，充分利用力求從速實現，實施上項建議，農業建設經費，必須大量增加，該團認爲此種增加，實爲增進中國全國國民福利與增加全國財政收人之所必需，政府方面，不宜吝惜之。</p>

<h3>長春日戰犯九十三名　將解送瀋陽行轅審訊　盼受害同胞速行到會作證</h3>
<p>〔中央社長春十七日電〕長春日職犯之檢舉工作，已因日僑遣送終結而吿一段落。長春爲過去僞滿之政治中心、主要戰犯，多在長春，惟因戰犯調査機構，成立過晚，除蘇軍在長時曾檢舉一部外，其餘戰犯大部均混入日僑中被遣返國。前於日僑管理所內，雖曾設有戰罪犯調査委員會，但其工作並無顯著成續，檢舉人數不多。及至九月廿四日，奉令成立戰犯調査委員會時，日僑已大部遣送回國。截至目前止，本市共撿舉日戰犯嫌疑犯九十三名，其中除極少數爲輕國人吿發者外，其餘均爲視其職務上有戰犯嫌疑而加以逮捕者。關於彼等之罪證，或因無人吿發，或以其所在地址現爲共軍侵佔區，調査極感困難。據悉：戰犯調査委員會已泰國防部令，最近即將解送至潘陽東北行轅之軍事法庭審訊，深希曾受其殘害之同胞速行到會作證，或以書前提出證據，以免再使彼等因證據不足而逃脫法網。</p>

<h3>社論　修正進出口貿易辦法</h3>
<p>修改海關稅則的提議，工商界呼籲已久。所呼籲的要點，除出口稅已予豁免外，大致可分爲三端：（一）一部份進口貨稅率的提高，（二）不必要的進口貨，加以限制或禁止，（三）十分需要的進口貨如機器。交通工具等，予以鼓勵和便利。</p>
<p>所謂修正進出口貿易辦法，昨日果已公佈了，是項修正辦法，還沒有涉及稅率部份，上述第一點，尙待繼續努力。但就已修正各點而言，共重要性不可謂不大，在我國對外貿易和關稅史上，也可謂劃時代的改革，茲撮要分述如决：</p>
<p>（一）一般的管制過去辦法，尙有一部份貨物可以自由進口，自山申請外匯。結果是外貨充斥，大量入超，民族工業，顯受到甚大的威脅，而且浪費外匯資金，使外匯率不易保持均衡的狀態。新辦法規定：輸入許可制度，推廣應用於一切進口貨物，其目的當然在矯正上項缺陷，使垂危中的國內工業，得到相當的保障。這項措置，無疑地可以博得普徧一般的同情。</p>
<p>（二）不必要貨品的禁止按照修正進出口貿易暫行辦法附表（三）乙·所載：本表包括附表（一）（二）（三）甲及（四）中未列入之貨品，在未另行公吿前，暫予停止輸入，而附表（四）禁止進口貨品，包括到稅則卅七號之多。凡消耗品，玩具，飾物，化裝品，貴重品，奢侈品一類貸物，一概明白禁止進口。這和過去單靠寓禁於征的手段，拿重稅來做壁壘的，顯然大有進步。這項措置，與一般人的期望，也可稱完全相符。</p>
<p>（三）限額制的實行和禁止進口同時實行的，還有限額制度。就是說：許可進口的貨物，其數量上，也要加以相當的限制。這項措置，如果能運用適當，一方面，可以緩和大量的入超，而國內的實際需要，也不至因噎廢食，感到非常的困難。我們認爲這也是十分合理的辦法。其進口商以已經向輸入臨時管理委員會登記核准者爲限，和分配數額，由進口商自行議定這兩點，在實施時，難免有點困難。不過這是手續上的問題，這項困難，諒不難加以克服。</p>
<p>（四）優先進口的貨物　凡國內生產事業所需要之必需品及原料，以及其他具有正當用途之物資，均許優先進口，又各項機械器材之輸人，並予以便利。這都是大家渴望已久的目標。不過嚴格說來，這還是原則，不是辦法。所謂必需，正當，便利，在將來實施的時候，希望處處顧到這個原則，千萬不要走樣。</p>
<p>（五）官商同等待遇修正辦法第十三條規定，貨品之由政府經營或管理之工商機關或公司輸入者，共中請輸人許可手續，與民營事業中請手續相同。我們對於這一條約意見，與上項相同。就是將來實施時，要處處顧到這個原則，千萬不要走樣。特別是公共需要或機關自身需要的輸入貨品，其許可申請手續，完全由行政院辦理，又輸人臨時管理委員會，還可以發給通用許可證，除掉救濟善後物資，和美國剩餘物資，租借物資以外，還有政府利用國外借款購置之貨品在內。如果不盡屬公共需要或機關自身需要的話，也希望顧到一般民營事業，使他們有同等分配的機會。</p>
<p>照當局表示：進口貨槪須許可，以後美鈔無所可用，不至發生黑市，我們當然也抱有同樣見解。不過充斥市塲的洋貨，除掉正式進口以外，還有大量的走私貨品。此等貨品，根本不報關，不結匯。在限制進口以後，供給愈少，價格愈貴，便是走私的利潤愈厚。所以走私這一條路，如果不取嚴厲措置，根本加以杜絕，則以後美鈔的黑市，究竟能否消滅？似乎還是疑問。這個責任，希望海關和有關各機關共同担負起來。</p>

<h3>贛省盜匪猖獗　劫輪劫車慘殺乘客　各縣聯防加強治安</h3>
<p>〔本綴南昌訊〕江西現在有一最嚴重現象，即是百業凋敝，失業日鈔，以　搶　特盛，大有羣盜如毛，寸步荆棘之感。然各搶案之發生，無一破案者，　因犯案者生活無着，臨時凑合，挺而走險，分贓後即行散夥，各奔生路，並無固定之積匪，所以無從摸捉也。</p>
<p>連續洗刧</p>
<p>贛江爲江西之唯一大動脈，亦即航運之中樞，日前雖時有民船被劫之事發生，然均在軍警耳目難週之地。乃本月十日，距省卅五里之三家店，福聯衛記公司上下兩輪同時遭匪洗劫，與前一週九民船同時被搶者如出一轍。緣十日下午一時許，由省開吉安之班輪福源號，行至三家店，突然岸上喝令檢査，時即槍聲卜卜，子彈橫飛，被迫停車，即有手特短槍及小刀之匪徒廿餘人，分乘四划子，蜂擁登輪，恣意搜劫，所有現鈔及貴重物品，囊刮一空，始乘原划登岸而去。事後得知，輪上賬房，即損失現金六百萬，旅客損失，無法統計。當該輪劫後，鼓輪上駛之際，適其姊妹輪新雲生由吉開抵此處，該夥匪徒又以槍射擊，迫其停靠，上輪搜刧，無微不至，時有一乘客爲軍人身份者，呌了一聲同志，你們不要傷害人命，匪徒即對之關一槍，並說你管不了，幸朱擊中，而另一匪徒又發一彈，中其腹部，血流如注，又有兩匪將其拖出，丢之水中，並補擊一槍，屍首隨即沉沒。搶劫歷三小時後，乃各呼嘯而去。該輪損失最少數千萬元。該公司出事後，即報吿軍警機關，請予補緝。</p>
<p>南潯路爲江西出長江之咽喉，乃竟兩日三刧車，本月初間，善後救濟總署車及商車各一輛，先後在張公渡兩岸各數公里處，被持械之匪徒劫車，後三日由省開潯之中國商行三一九〇二號客車，行至九江附近之姑塘，時近黃昏，突聞槍聲，運續有數子彈向車身射擊，被迫停車，時乘客中漆姓女孩彈自右耳根穿入，傷勢甚重，另一靑年，則彈穿右膀，均鮮血淋漓，爲狀極慘，匪徒七八人持槍登車搜刧半小時，乃向山中竄去，損失的五千萬元。</p>
<p>護路護航</p>
<p>以如此熾盛之搶風，再加以物價上漲，生活日趨艱窘，天寒歲暮，必當變本加厲，省保安司令部以冬防實施在即，對於各地搶案迭出，深爲重視，刻除派武裝部隊護路護航外，並通令各縣，實行聯防會哨，修復原有碉堡，收容散兵游勇，嚴密檢査槍枝，以事防範。至於贛粵湘邊，贛浙閩邊，及贛浙皖邊流匪，由軍隊配合當地團隊淸　，各地散距，則由地方團隊負責，自十二月至明春二月爲冬防期間，所有各地軍警均須依照冬防計劃，密切防護地方，維持治安。</p>

<h3>江蘇田賦徵實　　突破困難·正在順利進行限期不遠·可望圓滿完成</h3>
<p>— 本報記者利香林</p>
<p>鎭江訊</p>
<p>江蘇的田賦徵實，自蘇省府與省田糧處於本年七月二十日召開全省性的田糧業務檢討會議以後，即積極的展開了，準備開始征實的工作。在這個準備的時期中，它曾遭受到許許多多的困難，這困難的大前提，是由於江蘇省首先飽受敵人八年的蹂躪，這，非但糧政一項，即其他各種事業，皆因人力物力之失去平衡，而形成了如一個病人病後營餐失調的貧弱症。　可是，事實是相反的，江蘇的田賦征實，自九月十五日開征以來，雖然準備時期的工作相當的短，然而它的收穫與成就，已有相當的基礎，它的困難和貧弱，也漸漸的被衝破和消散，而順利的在江蘇省三十八個縣市中，推動着這一樁歷史上艱難而繁重的担子。</p>
<p>據該處副處長洪其琛剛自江南各縣視察返省語本報記者談：這一次前往吳江，蘇州，常熟，崑山等四縣視察，大致成續均極良好，各辦事人員均能仰體政府意旨，努力服務頗以爲慰。以上各縣均已開始征收。吳江因全部册串業已全部發出，征收時極爲順利，並無絲毫困難。蘇州，常熟，崑山三縣册串，現正日夜趕造，短期內即可全部完成。至各該縣鄉鎭辦事處及收納倉庫的機構，均已先後成立。記者復詢以本省各縣市開征後成續如何？據答：截至本月十日止，根據已報省處的，計鎭江二千多石，高淳二千多石，泰州九千多石，六合一萬八千多石，揚中一千五百石，江寗三萬石，丹陽三千五百石，江浦七千五百石，儀征五千六百多石，江都六千三百多石，溧陽二千三百多石，句容五千七百多石，以上均爲征收稻穀的縣份，其中高淳，江寗，六合，儀征，因晚稻較多，收穫不繼，故征起較慢。其折合法幣繳納的縣份，南通爲二百多萬元，太倉一億五千多萬元。據洪氏最後表示，江蘇田賦總算很順利的走上了平坦的路子，這一點，固然得到各個地方的力量協助很多，同時對辦事人員的精神，也感到異常的佩慰，希望這種精神永久保持，則限期之十二月十五日雖已不遠，想定能圓滿達成。</p>
<p>四種方式</p>
<p>又據該處管理處科長毛君白談江蘇田賦征實的實際情况，它說，在開始征實以前，因爲準備工作的時期匆促，加上江蘇的先天失調，爲了因地制宜而適合環境，特分四種方式征收：（一）征收稻穀，（二）征麥，（三）征棉，（四）折征法幣。征收稻穀各縣市，係按原有的正附稅合併計算，再暫以四成折算後，每賦額一元，征收稻穀三市斗，征借一市斗，帶征公糧九市升（三成），合計四市斗九市升，（即每賦一元實征一市斗九升六合）。至征收小麥縣份，照稻穀七折計算，即每一元征二市斗一市升，征借七市升，帶征公糧六市升三合（三成），共計三市斗四市升三合，（即每賦一元實征一市斗三升七合）。關於前項征實之騐收工具，係採用標準衡器，以市斤爲單位，兩以下四捨五入，稻穀一市石以一百零八市斤爲準。小麥一市石以一百四十五市斤爲準。</p>
<p>因地制宜</p>
<p>征收稻穀的縣份，共有二十七縣，爲江寗，高淳，句容，溧陽，溧水，丹陽，金壇，宜興，武進，無錫，蘇州，吳江，常熟，江陰，靑浦，金山，松江，崑山，揚中，江都，六合，儀徵，江浦，鎭江，泰縣，靖江，川沙等，以上各縣共應繳納三百八十八萬一千零五十二市石。征麥的縣份，計有三市縣，爲徐州市，銅山，東海，共應征麥三萬七千四百零三石。征棉的縣份，僅有崇明一縣，因該縣出產雜糧，故改繳苞米爲五萬多石。折征法幣的縣份，爲上海，太倉，寳山，嘉定，南匯，奉賢等七縣，共應征法幣數爲一百五十七億。末據毛氏稱：假如這三十八縣，至本年十二月十五日止全部征收起來，以每一元應繳一斗九升六合計算，可能有四百七十一萬五千多石，中央即可得一百七十幾萬石，市縣方面亦可得一百七十幾萬石，其餘的即可留爲省用，果如此，國家糧政的樹立，軍　民食的調劑，省縣經費的挹注，建設新江蘇的願望，常不難達成。</p>
<p>蘇北情形</p>
<p>最後，記者復詢以蘇北各縣收復後，田賦是否可獲免征？據答：免征蘇北田賦，已迭經省府及省臨參會向中央呼籲，停征一年，現聞此事可能予以邀准，免征之理由不外二點：（一）蘇北在抗戰八年中，已受盡敵僞匪摧殘，勝利後，又復遭共軍盤踞，地方元氣非但大傷，且農村亦已極度破產，目前各縣雖已先後收復，終因共軍在盤踞期間，悉被强征帶走，縱有遺留，當數當也不多；（二）征實効能不够，因各收復區的縣份册串遺失，戶籍紊亂，非經相當時期的整理不可。</p>
<p>由以上事實有來，江蘇田賦征實，總算很順利的推動了，我們希望這一摏大事能够迅速如期完成。</p>

<p>〔聯合社紐約十七日電〕外長會議今日對於解決特港膨理問題，已獲進展，惟於佔領軍之撤退期限問題，又遇新障碍。會議今日告終時，決議將何方管理特港警察之問題，移交法國外次特摩維爾擬具協定草案。蘇外長莫洛托夫再度提出佔領軍從特港撤退之限期問題，或將阻碍外長會議取得決議。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社紐約十七日電〕四外長今日開會時。討論法代表提關於特澳總督及當地保安主任權力之折衷計劃，大體均告通過，當即交由四國外次加以最後審核。該項計劃規定四點：</p>

<h3>安理會否決權問題　顧維鈞發表意見　聯大政治委員會暫停辯論　五大國今日會商限制辦法</h3>
<p>〔中央社紐約十六日專電〕我首席代表顧維鈞今天在職大政治安全委會初度討論否決權爭執時，附議大國一致之原則。顧氏於其演辭中，反對澳大利亞·古巴兩國所提之建議，即限制或取消聯合國憲章廿七條所規定之否決權，但建議改進應用第廿七條之最可實行之方法如次：（一）採用研究逐漸改進，善爲使用之長遠計劃；（二）經由討論界說與規定而改進程序之規定；（三）達成一種自由同意及普通承認之解釋。顧氏一如安理會其他一切之常任理事，亦堅決反對憲章止修改。彼稱，一中國代表團不信憲章修改之時期已至，此文件係吾人聯合國組織之憲法一致向意原則之實際理由。今日存在一如存在於簽署憲章之詩，此時任何欲修改憲章之輕率，足以根本動搖吾人組組之基礎。顧氏曾提出兩項最實際方法，以解決否決神問題：（一）建黴安理會採取金驟，促致廿七條之較完善與合理之應用，並改良其程序。（二）要求五常任理事就否決權應用問題，在舊金山會議時所作之聲明，准以詳盡解說，並於可能時列舉僅須從事程序表決之各項問題。</p>
<p>〔聯合社成功湖十六日電〕法國今日在聯大會政治委會提議停止辯論否決權問題，以待五大國先行討論，英代表諾爾貝克繼起發言，嚴辭指責蘇聯濫用否決權，致各項問題原可一致同意解決者，徒因蘇聯獨走極端而處處牽掣。惟諾爾貝克亦表示與四大國二致堅決反對修正聯合國憲章，如小國方面所要求者。沙國主張大會暫停討論否決權問題，諾貝爾克表示贊成。此一問題現決由安理會五常任理事國於星期一在紐約自行商定限制使用辦法。英外相貝文，中I國駐美大使顧維鈞，蘇外長莫洛托夫，美國務卿貝爾納斯及法代表巴洛迪均已應允參加。法國提議大會暫停討論案，雖無表示反對者，但今日並未付表決，以待已經登記準備發言之三國代表於星期一會議畢其辭後再說。惟無論如何，五大國會議決定星期一開會，不致變更。政治委會暫停討論否決權問題後，將進而討論第二項問題，則蘇聯要求各國報告駐紥國外軍隊人數一案。否決權問題一俟五大國會議提出報告後，再行討論。</p>

<h3>佔領期中的日本（中）　佔領工作分爲三個階段</h3>
<p>— 紐約時報駐東京特派員　派勞脫原著張德乾譯</p>
<p>日本政府已受侖終止對於全國神道教的一切支援神道教以十一萬個神座爲媒介，深入於七千五百萬日本人民的生活中去，強迫他們至少在口頭上承認天皇是神，日本人是神的子孫，必須替天行道，統治全世界。日本軍附系統所藉以行使權力的全部輔助機關均已消滅，但願牠們是永遠消滅了。其中包括秘密警察，思想警察，新聞臉查，學校中的軍事訓練和軍事生活等。</p>
<p>在年底的時候，佔領的第二階段，即肅清封建制度尤面、巳經近乎完成了，雖然新的份子仍在陸續被剔除出去，同時仍有許多新的戰犯尚待檢舉出來，或許尚需使用武力來威脅和阻止惡劣傾向的復活，或是新的不良份子的產生。</p>
<p>佔鋇的第三階段尚在我們前面，因爲新的機構已經遭受到內在外來的各種壓力和威脅。糧食問題，生產問題，財政問題，都很嚴重，毫無解決的辦法，——祇有臨時的措置，如輸入一些美軍口糧，來喂養日本人。</p>
<p>美國在佔領的第一年中，曾表示負責解決這許多問題，否則當承認美國對日政策的失敗，要是可能的話，當重新開始，再幹一次。可是第三階段的各項問題都極重要，其本身就值得從詳研討。</p>
<p>日本的經濟狀況之糟，是任何國家寗願犧牲牛油，消耗國富於槍砲者，所不能避免的。他們必須靠輸出才有得吃，要輸出必須製造，——他們還須償付一筆不知數字的賠款，其中大部份須用機器來抵付。日本在物質方面的福利，自然是日本的基本問題，可是據記者所知：還沒有人敢主張允許日本重建她舊有的武力，藉以復興日本帝國的。然而道也是一個聯合國的問題，因爲經濟崩潰的結果是混亂，過去曾由混亂而產生暴力政治，因而發生戰爭。今日日本的混亂，一俟時機成熟，便可能造成一次新的太平洋戰爭，正如德國的混亂終於產生希特勒一樣。</p>
<p>全部佔領機構的最高主席是麥帥，——碰巧他自己也是從戰場上的軍人復員而成爲一位行政官吏的；他的復員要比許多脫離軍隊回到家鄉去弄汽油筒的GI省力得多。他要遵照波茨坦宣言內一般原則的指示，去執行遠東委員會的指令；可是他是盟軍最高統帥，他這個職位嚴格地說來是一個「單人職位」。</p>
<p>據多數觀察家的意見：聯合國管制日本委員會對麥帥總部硃少有價值的援助。有幾位意存　觀的，甚至於稱之爲「辦論會」，其主要作用僅在讓聯合國代表們大家來出出氣。即使沒有這個委員會，佔領工作一樣會做到今日那樣程度的。</p>
<p>麥帥的面貌，比起記者於一九四四年夏在澳洲初次踏入西南太平洋戰區時所見，似乎略顯蒼老些；可是並沒有顯著的變化，雖然他在戰爭和佔領工作中所耗的精力是極爲巨大的，他與他的太太和幼子阿瑟同住在美國大使館中，他在市區一家保險公司大樓中，有一間小巧的寫字間，壁上襯着暗色的木板，掛着兩幅風景畫，後面有一隻玻璃門的書櫥，裏面是空的。</p>
<p>麥帥的工作時間很長，可是定得很古怪。他起身很早，在家裏料理一部份公事，遲至十一點鐘才上寫字間。他或許要到兩點鐘才離開寫字間去吃午飯，兩小時往再回到寫字間辦公，一直要到通常晚具時間以後好久才走。麥帥幾乎是沒有社交生活的。大使館的請客被減至最少限度，他祇有最最隆重的宴會才參加。從前在葬律賓第一次登陸艱苦作戰的時候，大家都躲在敝身處所，他却慣於先着頭在走廊裏散步，眼看着日軍的炸彈往下落。像他那樣的一個人，直到今日，連他自己的部下都很少有人認識他的。</p>
<p>佔領工作中純粹有關軍事的任務，都由艾契堡將軍來辦理，艾將軍曾在日本各地旅行數千哩，去考察他的第八軍士兵是在那兒如何生活？如何感覺？如何工作？如何游戲？麥帥却祗有一次曾離開東京，到菲律賓去參加獨立慶祝會。</p>
<p>日本人對第一年的佔領工作有何反應？這是一個很難解答的問題。事實上，日本人非但亳無抵抗，反而極願合作。可是將來佔領軍隊撤退後，日本人對我們所建立的制度是否願意維持下去？抑或將予以修改？抑或將根本予以推翻？却要看日本人對該項制度的估價若何，其實際成績若何了。多數日本人的心目中，對該項制度的意見究竟若何，或許尚朱決定，也當然還毫無表示。</p>

<p>黨務與文化界工作應打成一片</p>
<p>首由方治致詞稱，「今日恭請諸位光臨，非係普通應酬。黨務工作原應與文化工作打成一片，并利用此時機與諸位交換意見，及有所陳述。首先希望文化界諸先生發揚文化，促進文明。今日中國文化尚未達全國人希望之水準。且有若干地域砲火連天，人民顛沛流離。對於四維八德更應盡量發揮，蓋禮義廉恥，及忠孝仁愛信義和平原係維持中華民族存在之基本。吾人須使此種固有文化普及并於點·綫·質各方面皆有表現。其次應建設新文化，建設新國家。所謂新文化即爲全國人民所需要之三民主義文化。人人能愛國家愛民族，人人能各盡其能各取所需，人人能自己管理自己之三民主義文化。三民主義文化之精神，包括和平，幸福，民主，統一。此即中國人民所真正需要者。用槍桿打自己同胞，破壞和平統一，係共產黨之文化。吾人先須建設三民主義新文化，始能建設三民主義新中國。第三文化界應加緊團結，發揮文化界威力，共同團結，分工合作。最後方氏稱，還要說幾句公道話，因最近又突然檢舉影劇界有漢奸嫌疑者，使電影戲劇界朋友，人人自危，不能安心工作。事實上，若干被檢舉者，係遵從黨部地下工作同志指示，留滬堅守崗位者，何能稱之爲漢奸？要辦應辦主持人。希望大家能團結，如有大逆不道者將之清除，受寃枉者，共同爲之洗刷。</p>
<p>應認定真理　爲人民服務</p>
<p>次由吳市長致詞，所謂文化可有一簡單方式之答案，即人與禽獸不同之處。人與禽獸最大之區別，即爲禽獸係完全自私自利者，人能够不自私不自利。人有憐憫心，同情心，真理心，見義勇爲。所謂文化水準高，即爲追求真理，有同情心，不自私不自利，爲大眾服務。五月來本人於上海市任內，對共產黨成爲過激派，因爲共產黨所作所爲，違背上述之校準。本人五月來努力壓平物價，但有時仍無辦法。蓋一部份物價高漲因係奸商唯利是圖，另一部份，并非奸商所爲。例如，猪肉即無辦法，因肉係自江北運來，共黨控制下之蘇　，商人運猪，先要具條，回去之後需以美幣金條納稅，肉價豈能不漲，撤退之後，將蘇北猪仔，或殺或携走，以至來源缺乏。其次小麥，今年蘇北豐收，但共黨或將小麥運走，或將小麥燒毀，以致上海粉價不得不調整。第三本市今冬缺煤，亦係共黨所賜。倘津浦路通，煤礦不遭破壞，上海之煤決無問題。美鈔上漲，外匯變動之謠傳，係共黨以抗幣套取法幣十二萬萬元，至市場搜購，引起恐慌。共黨表面講和平統一，實際所爲皆係破壞，故文化界人士應認定真理，爲人民服務。</p>
<p>時局確嚴重　尚未至絕望</p>
<p>繼由潘議長公展致詞，首述個人對戲劇電影之愛好，及對正確運用影劇效果之重視。并解釋停辦劇校係參議會之決定，非議長個人或任何參議員所決定。參議會係代表全上海市民，而非代表某一方面，某一地區者。參議會當時之決定，係鑒於市府經費不足，學齡兒童失常者太多，此時此地國民學校較劇校更迫切。并無看輕劇校，看輕戲劇之意。至於參議會議案是否需覆議，應由市長決定。覆議結果如何，應視全體參議員意見而定。目前時局確達嚴重關頭。不過尚未絕望。因最初共黨稱國軍打下張家口即爲破裂。張家口旣下，忽改口稱時局關鍵在停戰。而政府停戰令下，又稱係片面之停戰，等於作戰。真不知爲何種邏輯。國軍停戰係片面停戰，意謂共軍仍要打。倘共軍亦肯片面停戰，豈非即雙方停戰？雖如此，尚未破裂。共黨改稱召集國大即破裂。現國大已召開，共黨稱之爲一黨包辦分裂之國大，決不參加。并稱國軍倘攻延安，即爲全面破裂。周恩來亦稱，和談仍可重開。可知尚未完全絕望。但吾人倘要共黨來參加，唯一辦法，即真正人民來說話，則共黨不能不來。人民應有是非，應有判斷。希望各位先生認清真相。當前局勢，取決兩種力量，不是人民力量決定，即由另外一種更大力量決定。要人民決定，須靠文化界喚起同胞。傅作義將軍稱，共黨到過之處如打防疫針，意即只有吃過共黨苦者始知共黨之害。</p>
<p>潘議長檢舉影劇界奸逆亦有說明，根據中央法令，影劇界人仕，僅主持而爲敵偽宣傳者始有罪。報載係偵查案，倘偵查無罪，檢察官當不起訴。</p>
<p>其他發言者有李萍倩，史東山，姚篷子，應雲衛等。最後并有餘興，至六時餘而散。</p>

<h3>煤氣十年計劃　聘請專家成立技術會　市公用局擬訂方策中　三煤氣廠連環供應　日產達千萬立方呎</h3>
<p>市公用局頃擬訂整理煤氣事業「十年計劃」。據該局局長趙曾鈺氏談：本局按照目前實情，及將來需要，擬訂足敷一千五百萬市民應用之發展煤氣事業計劃。按照歷年統計結果，戰前本市僅有氣用戶數千戶，每日產量約一百餘萬立方英尺。抗戰期間，各地人民集中市區，人口激增，且以燃料昂貴，相率採用煤氣者達二萬戶，（英商煤氣公司一萬九千戶，吳淞煤氣廠一千戶）。日產煤氣量爲英商廠三百五十萬立方呎，吳淞廠五十萬立方呎，共計四百萬立方呎。但兩廠之設備遭敵寇破壞，勝利後器材補充困難，并經一再提高用量度限後，目前供應量已達最高負荷點，無法再行增加產量。是以申請接裝煤氣之新用戶實無法接受。本局爲謀補救上項困難起見，特出請專家，成立煤氣技術會議，擬以技術觀點，尋求治標及治本方策。治標方策爲求解決目前煤氣供應量之恐慌，現憶擬就步驟三項：（一）採用含揮發物較高之煤斤，約可增加煤氣產量百分之二十五至三十左右。（二）積極修理現有煤氣發生爐，使產氣效率增高而無停頓之虞。（三）勸告用戶不作無謂浪費，使每一立方呎煤氣，盡其最高之效用。此三項步驟，現已積極進行中，預期年內，可獲圓滿成效。</p>
<p>至治本方策，將以配合大上海都市計劃爲原則，以期建設大上海。目前本市人口僅四百萬，而煤氣供應已感中足。若都市計劃實施後，人口將增至一千五百萬。故其治本方策，將以供應一千五百萬人口需要量之煤氣爲目的。其先後步驟計分五項：（一）根據以往記錄，煤氣用量每年增百分之五，以複利方式計算，十年後煤氣用量，將增至每日可產生九百萬立方呎。另加工業用途之增多，故十年後之上海需要一千萬立方呎之煤氣。（二）擬在南市沿黃浦設立一新式煤氣製造廠，每日產量爲四百至五百萬立方呎。同時將吳淞煤氣廠擴充設備，加添煙氣爐，使每日能產煤氣二百萬立方呎。連英商楊樹浦廠之每日四百萬立方呎。如此則本市將有三煤氣廠分設滬市四週，總扼上海煤氣供應之總紐。（三）計劃鋪設全市高壓管供應綱及煤氣供應站，使上述三廠高壓管互相連接。若此則一廠有障碍時，他廠得代之供應，使煤氣在供應上永無停頓之虞。（四）煤氣廠旣分據三處，本市將來煤氣供應區，亦擬因廠址之地位而劃分成三大供應區，即吳淞，實山，江灣工業區，將由吳淞煤氣廠供應；市中心，楊樹浦，閘北，虹口及蘇州河以北地區，因鄰近楊樹浦廠，擬由該廠供應；市區舊法租界，滬西，南市等蘇州河以南地區，則由南市煤氣廠供應。如此則各區因靠近製造廠，旣便於供應，且使壓力正常，當無降低不够之弊。其服務效率，亦可因此提高。（五）統一管理各廠，現英商煤氣與市營吳淞煤氣廠之間，因專營合約關係，分區營業，各自爲政，殊不合理，其影響煤氣之供應量及構成全市煤氣綱之阻礙甚鉅。故將英商煤氣公司專營權滿期後，合併煤氣公司組織，俾在統一管理下積極增加生產。</p>

<h3>妻往旅館幽會　本夫刀戳姦夫</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕鎭江人王立貴，四十二歲，住雲南南路德行里十八號，平日擺設襪攤。三月前其妻與附近擺攤刻字之應國慶發生喛味，不時假旅實幽會，日久春光洩漏，被王偵悉，但仍不動聲色。某日應與其妻又借客寓續歡，經王馳往捉姦，卒將一對野鴛鴦擒獲，當經人出爲調解，由應具悔過書并出法幣十萬元了事。比至昨晚九時半，王立貴在家得其十四歲女兒聲稱，乃母又與應姓偕往旅館，於是王怒火中燒，四出找尋，行經八仙橋附近，適遇姦夫應國慶迎面而來，王突出犀利小刀，犯戳其右臂及右中指，血流不止，嗣鳴警將王拘獲，帶入泰山分局核辦。</p>

<p>市公用局所辦之八路公共汽車，決定今日起正式行駛，其起點爲北站，中經實山路，天通庵，魏德邁路至五角場爲終點。至九路公共汽車，現正積極籌備中，預定路綫爲自新世界起至南市大木橋，（即市工務局所築之市民新村）預期下月初旬，即可正式開駛。</p>
<p>本市各公共車輛，因軍警無票乘車，直接影響收入，且車廂秩序，亦極爲混亂。市公用局爲謀整頓起見，現已與勤備部及憲兵二十三團商妥，規定軍警乘車優待辦法，各公司合發軍警長期免費乘車證一千二百張，交由警備司令部轉發駐滬海陸空軍留守部隊九百張，至其餘三百張，規定爲警備部及警察局各一百五十張。此項免費乘車證限因公出差，服裝及符號整齊之軍警備用。至無此項免費乘車證之軍警，另訂優待辦法，每次乘車不分遠近，電車每次一百元，公共汽車每次二百元，惟亦限服裝符號整齊者爲限，此項辦法，亦定今日起正式實行。</p>
<h3>「木乃伊」　上海的弄堂新聞　老和尚死後塗金　爭道是修行成果</h3>
<p>〔本報特寫〕這是一個勢將引起讀者傳談的新聞。—埃及的「木乃伊」，世界聞名，杭州博物館的「木乃伊」，一樣引人入勝。我們卻從未知道，上海也有一個「木乃伊」，也許由於迷信，這「木乃伊」的保管者，一直是秘而不宣。但這一秘　終於給人發現了。</p>
<p>遠在四年以前，憶定盤路五〇〇弄九二號A字的天真佛堂裏，有一個名呌「邱遵松法師」的老和尚，他相信以他的虔誠，有資格「圓寂」登天，於是在他臨死之前的四個月，就與飯菜隔絕，祇呷一些薄粥，慢慢地連粥也不呷，單以水菓腹了。而到臨死以前的一百天時，簡直是滴水不進的。</p>
<p>一天，他似乎有了死的預兆，他要徒弟把理髪師請來，把頭髪剃光了。然後說：「我要歸天了。」并且囑咐他的徒弟，不要把他的「肉身」焚化。接着，他索食西瓜三隻，就打着佛坐，像瞌睡似的逝去了。時爲民國卅一年夏曆三月初四日。</p>
<p>他的徒弟，遵照老師的遺言，并沒有將邱遵松法師屍體焚化，而以兩隻缸作爲靈柩，合蓋起來，供置在佛堂裏。爲了怕屍體腐爛，在缸內遍置炭，松香，檀香，和綫香等。</p>
<p>在八十天之後，邱遵松的徒弟小和尚在好奇心驅使下，把那兩隻缸打開了，他以爲應該腐爛得不像樣了，然而出乎他意外的，他的老師依然像瞌睡似的打着佛座，皮肉一點也沒有脫落，所不同的，祇是皮膚已經成了白色。</p>
<p>這個情形，落在小和尚的眼廉裏，他不會聯想到「木乃伊」這個新名詞，他所意識到的，無非是師父「登了天」，「成了仙」。於是他每天爲他師父祭　，如同師父活着那樣。</p>
<p>當年中秋節，這一秘密忽爲一對進香的善男信女—應氏夫婦所知悉，他們也以爲邱遵松修行成果，值得崇拜。於是，他們要爲這「木乃伊」塗金。自然，小和尚也不加以反對，塗金盛典也就隆重舉行，先由小和尚施以全身沐浴，爲他穿上一件夏布衫，然後以麺粉調糊，刷在衣體之上，最後塗上黃閃閃的金。</p>
<p>記者看到的金像，頭有點傾垂，額上有皺紋，助骨畢露，眼睛閉着披大紅披肩，在三面是玻璃，一面是板的神龕裏，打着佛座。小和尚說：「他的頭本來是直着，勃下用香棒撑着，後來給小孩把香棒碰斷了，他的頭就就垂了下來。」</p>
<p>現在，這邱遵松法師金色遺體，已經被視爲一尊「菩薩」，受善男信女們焚香禮拜了！</p>

<h3>社會服務　讀者諮詢</h3>
<p>法律質疑</p>
<p>（一）離婚改嫁</p>
<p>沈文華問友人某甲，其妻乙，因與兩某熱戀，向甲提出離婚要求，甲表示同意并願立約爲憑，約內訂明，如乙與丙結婚，則該約無效，請問此約在法律上能否成立？</p>
<p>〔傳況鱗師答〕乙旣因戀丙而始向甲要求離婚，離婚後斷無不與丙結婚之理。若以離婚後不與兩結婚爲離婚之條件，則此種條件等於具文。乙丙兩人從暫時不結婚而姘居，亦可俟時過境遷再爲結婚，事實上旣難強其履行離婚契約所附之條件，法律上除因姦經判決離婚或受弄之宣告者，不得與相姦者結婚外，無禁止明文。</p>
<p>（二）難偕白首</p>
<p>王農隱問　敵戚徐君於民國三十年憑媒同鄕吳女爲妻，初尚相安無事，旋因性情不合，時生齟齬，吳君以長此以往，殊難偕老，遂忍痛與吳女離婚，奈然鄕間辦事，手續多與法律不合，現有疑問：（一）如男女雙方願無條件離婚，請律師簽字證明，在法律上有否效力？女方家長有權干涉否？（二）如由徐君立一離婚據由吳女簽字，在有無效力？（吳女不識字）（三）如果現在吳女不別而行，徐君登報警告，作永遠脫離夫婦關係論，未知在法律上有效力否？</p>
<p>〔傅況鱗律師答〕（一）夫妻兩願離婚，由律師立證明，在法律上自然有效，但須二人以上之證明，如男女均已成年，（滿二十歲爲成年）父母無權干涉；（二）應依上列第一款前段所述辦法辦理爲妥；（三）妻若不別而去，是惡意遺棄其夫，已構成離婚條件，爲避免後日糾葛，應先登報警告，限期歸家，逾期不歸，再向法院申請離婚。</p>

<h3>暴行在寬大中被遺忘　劊子手倒要回國去了</h3>
<p>爲什麼審判戰犯如此之少　爲什麼不能治以應得之罪</p>
<p>難道奸淫燒殺都是幻象麼？</p>
<p>〔本報特稿〕時間往往把人們的記憶沖淡，今天離開抗戰的結束還僅一年有餘，大家對於八年中所受敵人的種種暴行虐待，似乎已經逐漸淡忘了。至少可以說對於如何懲罰那些曾經是凶惡的劊子手的戰犯，已經并不怎樣熱心注意。政府雖然設置幾個管理戰犯審判戰犯的機構，但除了斷斷續續在報紙上看到一些消息以外，一年來所有的結果，就祇是在南京槍決了一個酒井隆，在上海判決了號稱「江陰之虎」的下田次郎的死刑，（然而一直到現在還是不能執行）。而集中在江灣附近受「感化」一年多的一千多個嫌疑戰犯，則聽說在年底以前都要遣送回國去了。</p>
<p>也許有人懷疑，這麼多的嫌疑犯之中，真正的戰犯爲什麼如此之少？難道無數人在過去所親身經歷所耳聞目睹的罪行。都是些幻象，都是些無稽之談？記得上一次蒙難同志指認敵憲的時候，有一位殉難烈士的太太，曾咬牙切齒地向管理人說過非常憤激的話。她說：「不要讓他們回去，把他們統統用機關槍射死！」這一位太太的想法固然太爲天真，但是由此可以啟示我們，至今在民間，的確還有許許多多含寃未伸的同胞。因此勻人不免要問：爲什麼不能趕緊治戰犯以應得之罪呢？</p>
<p>困難在缺乏證據</p>
<p>據負責當局告訴記者：最大困難在於「證據」的缺乏。因爲現在國際間講「文明」，不像以前野　時代，戰勝的一方可以將捉來的敵人盡情殺戮，而我們要保持泱泱大國的風度，儘管敵爲當初并未以道義待我，而現在我們卻必須以公正示敵，要公正，當然一切必須根據法的立場；要根據法的立場，一切就少不了證據，旣不能以其人之道，還治其人之身，來「酷刑逼供」，就祇好眼巴巴看他綱開四面！</p>
<p>被害人畏縮怕事</p>
<p>那麼證據的搜集究竟有些什麼困難呢？除了有些疇根本就不留痕蹤跡，無從找覓外，國人的晴縮怕事，常使擔任審訊工作的法官啼笑皆非。不少被害人都有這樣的念頭：事清已經過去了，算了吧！何必再找麻煩呢！像最近新亞電器廠經理林超那樣能够激於義憤，願協助法庭至寗波搜集芝原平三郎逼姦婦女證據的這一種熱心的人士，實在太難得了。據記者所聽到，曾經有一位應該做證人的拒絕作證，他甚至曾說了這樣的話：「我出庭作證，僅僅憑我口裏說的，是否能判他罪還不能知，萬一將來日本人再得勢，我倒又要遭殃了。」這一種懦弱的準征服者心理，固然令人嘆惜，但是在一年來國內的混亂局勢與日漸走上復興之路的日本情形對比之下，的確是難免有所令人警惕的。</p>
<p>負責機關牽制多</p>
<p>除此之外，種種交通旅費等等，勢難希望他們肯自動來出庭作證，而負責　機關本身由於經費的缺乏與人事的牽制，亦遲緩了工作的進行。又例如管理機構由於警衛力的薄弱，因而採取寬大懷柔的政策；審判機構由於庭長的交替，使工作停頓了數月；由於經費與車輛的缺少，使調查與審訊時感困難。</p>
<p>有一位負責人說得好：「我們已經把他們關了一年多，但是提不出證據來，再關下去也不好意思，祇好讓他們回去吧。」雖說如果以後發現罪證，仍舊可以迎提來華，但是這恐怕也不過是說說罷了。我們現在所能希望的，就祇有讓那些已經關在提籃橋監獄裏的戰犯們，早些得到他們應受的責罰吧！</p>

<p>這一所管理另一世界的衙門，除了香火氤　之外，已成了一個熱鬧市場…</p>
<h3>上海城隍廟小史　本報特稿</h3>
<p>這一座具有五百餘年歷史的上海城隍廟，凡是初到上海的旅客，必要前去瞻仰一番。這一所管理另一世界的衙門，除了香火氤　之外，已成了一個執熱鬧市塲，和南京的夫子廟，蘇州的玄妙觀，不相上下，</p>
<p>考上海最初的城隍廟，在宋刺已有了，但並不在現在的地方。那時上海只是一個鎭市，並無城隍，只有華亭縣的城隍，供奉在淡井廟裏，因此淡井廟也就稱爲華亭城隍行殿。元至元二十九年（公元一二九〇年），上海難縣，始立城隍，但仍供奉在淡井廟中。</p>
<p>現在新北門內的城隍廟，是明刺永樂年間——的在公元一四〇三年至一四二四年之間——由知縣張守約就金山廟改建的。金山廟又名霍光行詞，祀奉漢代博陸侯霍光，其建立年代據「吳越備史」所載，在三國之末，爲吳王孫皓所築。及改作城隍廟，仍兼祀霍光，所以向有「前　爲霍，後殿爲秦」的傳說。（秦指城隍神秦裕伯。）</p>
<p>五百年中飽經滄桑</p>
<p>城隍廟改建之初，並沒有像今日這樣的規模，在五百餘年中曾遭遇過多决災禍，紅牆紫瓦，泥塑木偶，已飽經滄桑。每次燬損，修理時必加擴充，日積月累，纔成今日的局面。第一次修理是在明朝天順年間（一四五七—一四六四），知縣李紋，在殿前建亭，並將誥文刻石。嘉靖十四年（一五三五年）因廟門過小，管廟的人募集財帛，建造牌坊一座，當時上海新任知縣馮彬曾題「海隅保障」四字，由一永嘉神童書寫。（見萬曆上海縣志。）</p>
<p>萬曆三十年（一六〇二年），知縣劉一爌又　重建，僅四年，燬於火；三十四年由知縣李繼周重建。明崇禎初，在儀門上建造戲樓，並在廟後添造寢宮。</p>
<p>到了淸康熙二十二年（一六八三年）知縣史彩捐俸倡修，由眞君祠道士募化興工，建鼓亭二所，（見康熙上海縣志。）康熙四十八年（一七一〇年）本地人士在廟東構建東園，而城隍廟始爲城內名勝之所。雍正十三年（一七三五年）廟內住持募修一次。乾隆十三年（一七四八年）寢宮　燬，後由知縣王侹重建。</p>
<p>乾隆中葉·店肆林立</p>
<p>從改建金山祠到那時爲止，廟基佔地十二畝六分，並不怎樣大。直到乾隆中葉，又購買豫園作爲城隍廟的西園，分地修葺，闢爲畝八分九釐二毫。而遊人亦漸見各業公所，廟基又擴大至三十六增多，終至店肆林立。</p>
<h3>二百年來　多災多難八次遭刦</h3>
<p>在最近二百餘年中，城隍廟眞是「多災多難」，共遭火刦五次，兵刦三次。乾隆十三年第一次火災後，屢次修建。乾隆五十九年（一七九四年）這會葛文英募建後樓，嘉慶三年（一七九八年）復將大殿刷新，在兩無列二十四司，儀門外及殿西偏爲四司殿。道光十六年（一八三六年）遭第二次火刦，西廡及戲樓焚燬，後由衆商集資重修。</p>
<p>從道光二十二年至咸豐十年（公元一八四二至一八六〇年），的二十年中，中國正被內亂外侮鬧得不可開交，而城隍廟也遭受空前厄運，先後遇到了三次兵刦。第一次在道光二十二年五月十一日，被英水手佔領五天，作爲臨時駐屯所。第二次在咸豐三年，小刀會首領林阿福劉麗川等率衆佔領上海，城隍廟被盤據爲司令部，先後凡一年又六個月。第三次在咸豐十年，太平軍壓境，蘇松太道吳煦邀請英法軍隊入城防守，將城隍廟改爲英法兵營，被這批碧眼丘八把園景破壞殆盡，損失不貲。　至同治四年（一八六五年），由知縣王宗濂等重行修築，費錢一萬八千餘緡，歷時九月，才把城隍廟重復舊日壯觀。緒十九年，（一八九三年）知縣黃承暄募捐建築頭門二門轅門大殿，以及戲樓鼓亭。决年漕運頒懸「保釐蒼赤」匾額。</p>
<p>是時廟內遊人日多，商店日盛，各業因見有利可圖，紛紛以餘地出租，造屋設肆，馴至園中幾無隙地。因此在光緒二十四年，知縣黃承喧曾出吿示：「永禁隙地造屋，致毁園境。」宣統元年（一九〇九年），知縣李超瓊又募款重修牆壁及大殿寢宮。</p>
<p>民國以後又遭火災三次</p>
<p>民國以後，又連受火災三次；民國十一年十月初八（農曆）失一火，由地方公款公產處重行修葺。十三年七月十五日，大殿失火，竟吿焚如，通金山神主的脫沙像同遭刦運。同年十一月二十六日又焚去東樓一角，殃及殿宇。嗣後邑廟董事會協同海上杜月笙·黃金榮·張嘯林諸氏捐款重建，費銀五萬元，從民國十五年四月興工，至次年十一月工竣，建成了今日一座鋼骨水泥的建築。同月二十五日，邑廟董事會陳列珍羞，遵循古禮致祭，舉行開光典禮，是日善男信女來廟觀光者絡繹不絕。</p>
<p>新城隍廟·夕陽黃昏</p>
<p>民國二十六年抗日軍興，南市旋陷敵手，城內亦遭蹂躪，難民羣集一隅。其時有饒神父者，起而設立難民區，區中房屋，得以保全，而城隍廟適在其內。不過敵騎四布，進出維艱，於是一般靠「老爺」喫飯的人，大動腦筋，又在呂宋路搭建「新城陸廟」，居然商肆林立，生涯鼎盛。而這位「西貝」老爺，靠了「租界」的庇蔭，也招來了善男信女的香火供奉。勝利後，南市原址大率已恢復舊觀，「淪陷老爺」早在復員之列，香火重興。呂宋路的新城隍廟，巳是「夕陽黃昏」，其命運恐將不會久長的了。</p>
<p>九曲橋上，遊人熙來　往。（本報攝）</p>
<h3>外人眼中看法不同</h3>
<p>西班牙文學家伊本內茲，在他的遺著『一個小說家的週遊世界記「中，對於上海的城隍廟，表示着衷心的讚美，尤其對城隍廟中的湖心亭和九曲橋。他又讚歎那座「老爺花園」說中國人的心目中視爲各建築，正如埃及金字塔和華盛頓的白宮在西方人的心目中一樣。</p>
<p>前法領事梅蓬遊城隍廟的印象，是街上嘈雜得煩囂非常，他們做出鬧聲去引動善神，同時也做出鬧聲去驅逐惡神。」</p>
<p>於是他武斷地下了一個結論：</p>
<p>〔中國人都是不喜歡安靜的，甚至都似怕安靜的。」</p>
<p>有一個字林西報的記者，替湖心亭的照片上寫說明，他可沒有多饒舌，只說：</p>
<p>〔到茶屋去的遊客，愛給自己預備兩個銅子的糕餅，去丟給池子裏的魚和龜吃。」</p>
<p>前新天安堂主敎達文德，他曾經遊遍了上海邑城，他發表了如次的感想：</p>
<p>『我們跑進了城隍廟，……午後，這庭子是一個市塲，看到的人便想到了耶路撒冷古寺的買賣者。這兒有小喫舖子，賣玩具的，香店與玩把戲的。』</p>
<h3>城隍廟歳事記</h3>
<p>上海在尙未開闢商埠時，闔城惟一的娛樂塲所便是城隍廟。所以一年中盛事極多，雖然現在大半已成爲歷史上的陳跡，但是爲孓保存風土研究資料起見，就開見所及，拉雜記下如次的一筆流水賬；</p>
<p>新春　城隍廟內園和萃秀堂等處，向例在每月朔望日開放二次，供人遊覽，只有在新年初旬，終日重門不掩，仕女熙攘往來，途爲之　，尤以元旦一天，更形擁擠。</p>
<p>梅花會　在每年農曆正月初三，內圖例開梅花會，供遊客們玩賞。</p>
<p>元宵　農曆正月十五夜，廟內各處火樹銀花，管弦若沸，金吾不禁，遊人羣集。在元宵前幾天，還有「燈市」，羣販薈聚廟旁，出賣彩燈。</p>
<p>城隍神誕辰　相傳在農曆二月二十一日，例有羽土設壇諷經，並有「老爺」的「下屬」晋謁拜壽。</p>
<p>城隍奶奶生日　在晨曆三月二十八日，廟內　燈結綵，仕女往觀者甚多，其盛况往往遠過於「老爺」的生日。</p>
<p>三巡會　城隍神每年向例出巡三次，其任務爲「賬濟孤魂」，時期在淸明前一日，七月半（中元節）和十月初一。出巡時，帶同隨員「新江」「長人」「高昌」「財帛」四司，儀仗前導，士民手執香花以從。並時有烟花女子，濃妝豓服，披　　　，或坐無頂小轎，裝做「女犯」。於是不免引誘浮浪子弟，趨之若驚</p>
<p>至同治年間，知縣葉廷春方出。嚴禁。示</p>
<p>立夏　舊俗須進新麥上供。蘭花會每在農歷四月下旬，在西園召開。會期凡三日，公開展覽。滿堂羅列佳種，爭奇鬥勝，列首座者羣呼爲「狀元」。</p>
<p>天貺節　在農曆六月初六，由全城衣工在城隍廟舉行「曬袍會一。</p>
<p>菊花會　在九月中旬，但並非每年舉行，與賽菊花，經品評甲乙，分「新巧」，「高貴」，「珍異」三項，盆上標列藝菊主人姓氏。第一次菊花會在四美軒舉行。</p>
<h3>復員後的城隍廟　一面貼着靈籤五百元　一面貼着謹防扒兒手</h3>
<p>〔本報特寫〕天冷了，城院廟還是那樣的熱鬧，這位復員歸來的城隍老爺，在香烟繚繞中，受着他虔誠信徒們的膜拜。兩側的大柱上，一面貼着「靈籤五百元」，另一面貼着「謹防毳手」。</p>
<p>但，到城隍廟來上香叩拜的，是遠不及來閒逛的人們那樣多。這裏寺廟的意味，已被商塲氣息蓋罩了。一走進大門，就是各種攤頭，賣毛巾，鏡子，茶杯等日常用品的，賣魷魚排骨的，酒釀圖子的，還有推算流年的哲學家們。然而，生意都極淸淡，人們到這裏來，似乎祗是閒逛，並不想買甚麼。</p>
<p>九曲橋上也是黑壓壓的一片人，和南京路上一樣，前面的人堵住你的去路，後面的人推着你向前。你隨便拉一個人問間，這樣冷的天擠來擠去幹什麼？他不把你當瘋子，也不會理你。上海本就有許多人，把生命打發在擠來擠去中。　橋的轉角上，也擺着一些小地攤。這裏和廟內的攤頭不同，它已是美國貨的世界了：賣軍用食盒的，玻璃褲帶的，還有「美國刷子」。</p>
<p>橋下的池水是混濁的，漂着碎紙，栗子殼，各種各樣的廢物，却也有人倚欄對它呆視，難這眞想發現甚麼奇蹟，或是尋找一條游魚嗎？</p>
<p>走過橋去，也還是擠不開的人，和一家一家的店。店裏的人，把手插在袖子裏，伏在櫃台上，望着擠來擠去的人。這些擠來擠去的人中，也有站下來，望着店內櫉上貨物的。但望了望，又擠過去了。</p>
<p>彎過去，就是世界聯合商塲了。踏上樓去，人是更多了。在這空氣惡濁到難以忍受的屋子裏，人們極有興趣的擠着，也不時的聽見有人呌着：「擠呀！擠呀！」</p>
<p>記者也就這樣擠呀擠的，擠了出來。</p>
<h3>城隍廟園林譚　俯仰之間·已成陳迹</h3>
<p>東園</p>
<p>「神祠北際名園闢，寢廟東徧別殿開，</p>
<p>更擬登高望雲物，人間車築小靈台</p>
<p>這是邑中進士曹一士爲城隍廟東園內的小靈台題詠的詩。東園又名內園，建築的年代在康熙四十八年，後因錢業歷任修葺之費，即設公所於此。租界開闢後，北市錢業驟興，凡關於南北市公共事件，恒在此會議。嗣南市又另設錢業公所，而北市亦有錢業會館，即以此爲總公所。</p>
<p>園基雖不甚廣，而當時建築，似乎也費過一番苦心。同治志云：「毫沼樹石皆古雅，洵勝景也。一園中曲檻脩廊，花木幽深，最勝處便是小靈台，據曹一士自序說：「臺高可十餘丈，廣僅容宴豆，而浦之東南北三面咸在。」可見當時的台相當高，足以登臨眺望。又據乾隆上海縣志所載：「台前在東園東隅，今廢。」後來大的在嘉慶前後，重新建造，址在園之西南隅，高僅數丈。</p>
<p>西園前身·豫園舊址</p>
<p>西園原是潘氏豫園的舊址。明嘉靖時，四川布政司邑人潘允端所建，其意在侍奉其父潘恩，作老年觴詠之地，園廣數十畝，竭全家財力，前後經營二十年，始觀厥成。當時園內勝景，有：</p>
<p>玉華堂，會景堂，容與堂，醉月樓，挹秀亭，魚樂軒，樂壽堂，留影亭，含碧亭，徵陽樓，玉茵閣，頤晚樓，留春窩，鳬佚亭等。</p>
<p>此外尙有家祠及各種神祠，鑿地作池，疊石成山，池沼遍園，山石錯列，陸具澗嶺洞　之勝，水極島灘梁渡之趣。加植名花珍木，佈置曲梁閣道，登山可便俯眺，蕩舟足以遶遊。此外尙有家祠，並建園中。入門處的小坊潘氏題有「人境壺天」四字，坊西高墉，又刻「寰巾大快」字樣，潘氏得意，可以想見。</p>
<p>盛衰循環·好景不常</p>
<p>然而世上園林，總逃不過盛衰循環，好景不常，到了潘氏子孫手裘，家道已漸式微，豫園也荒蕪不修，終於無主，由闔邑人士以賤價購得，歸入城隍廟。其時在淸乾隆年間，廟寢東首，已有東園，所以稱做西園，重加興修，又是二十餘年，方才完成，費用達數萬金。園基舊稱廣　七十餘畝，但據同治七年的淸丈，僅得三十六畝八分九釐二毫。園中雖仍疊石鑿池，栽花藝竹，但是精舍大多數作爲各業的公墅。原因是如此：西園是公共的建築物，無人管理，當然不行；特；特別組織一個管理機關，則常年經費，尤其是地產的納糧，發生很大的問題。所以當時各業就用「半借用式」的辦法，在園中認定一部分，作爲該業公所，同時納糧及房屋修理費即歸該公所負擔。　當時西園景物，與豫園時代完全兩樣，若將喬鍾吳的「西園記」及玉紫銓的「瀛瓀雜誌」所記各節，翻閱一過，舊日西園景物，猶不啻置身其間，恍然在目。</p>
<p>嗣後又添建超然臺，回迥樓，點春堂，五老峯諸勝，並改王華堂爲香雪堂，萬花深處爲萬花樓，於是勝景愈多，遊人不絕。</p>
<p>二度兵刧·湖山盡廢</p>
<p>道光二十二年（公元一八四二年），英國兵船攻佔吳淞駐屯城隍廟，九曲橋頭所植的紅蓮首遭刦運。咸豐三年，小刀會亂起，園中寳廬，盡成會黨巢穴，淸兵入城，西園遭火刦。香雪堂成爲一片瓦礫塲，蓮花廳，得月樓，花神閣等也同化刦灰。僅五老峯，玉玲瓏等奇石猶巍然獨存，地塘無恙，綠水依然，依稀堪認舊日規模。咸豐十年，（一八六〇年，）太平軍入境，英法防丘進城助守，西園作爲營所，於是假山遭殃，湖山盡廢，事平後，雖經巡道丁日昌交涉撤退，然而西園竟已被蹂躪毁壞，面目全非！</p>
<p>同治四年（一八六五年）重行修築，於是又煥然一新，但是因爲另起爐灶的緣故，其景物已大異於舊日的西園了。現僅香雪堂前玉玲瓏石，猶是豫園故物。該石相傳爲宋徽宗時花石綱故物，運石渡浦江中，忽起狂風，石與舟俱沉水中，後用巨綆入水曳起，即是此玉玲瓏石。石巔有「玉華」二字，豫園主人潘允伯所築「玉華堂」，就是以此爲名的。此外尙有九獅亭畔的奎星石。是乾隆時西園遺物。「澤國紀聞」云：「原是王氏素園物。」本有大士·奎星·寒山·拾得等狀，五石嶒峻，故稱五老峯，今只存其一。其餘建築，都是兵亂後添設的了。</p>
<p>從園林的興廢，也可以的略看到近三百年來上海的治亂跡象。</p>
<h3>上海城隍秦裕伯　今年六百五十歲</h3>
<p>本市的城隍老爺，相傳是明朝的待制秦裕伯。這「相傳」兩字，是據淸代曹一士所著的四焉齋文集巾上海縣城隍神頌，和褚文洲所著的滬城備考。他們都異口同聲地說是「秦公裕伯」，但確切的證據已難找尋了，於是這一「相傳」便相傳到現在。</p>
<p>秦裕伯，字惟饒，又字景容，號葵齋，是宋代龍圖閣學士秦少游的七世孫，曾祖天佑，祇父知柔，世籍揚州府高郵縣，因宋末兵亂，才由他祖父移居到上海來。父名良顥，號述齋，母唐氏，秦裕伯的出生，在元貞元二年六月十二日，（公曆一二九五年七月二十五日）推算起來，今年正是六百五十歲。</p>
<p>秦氏幼時</p>
<p>隨父遊大名，冒大名籍肄業胃監，在四十九歲的時候（元至正四年，公元一三四四年）方中了進士。旋任湖廣行省照磨，至正十年（一三五〇年）復遷山東高密縣縣尹，兩年後升福建行省郞中。元末世亂，棄官寓揚州，不久遷至上海。是時張士誠佔據蘇州，聞秦氏之賢，派人來請他出山，他沒有去。至正二十五年，（一三六五年）母唐氏逝世，他就在家中守孝，明太祖起兵完亂，命巾書省檄召之，但是秦氏生性固執，晚年淡泊功名，囑其弟亨伯上書回絕，書中說：</p>
<p>「承元帝爵祿十餘年，今背之而起，是不忠也；身有母喪，未及終制，忘哀而出是不孝也。」</p>
<p>明洪武元年，（一三六八年）太祖又去請他，秦氏仍稱病不出。結果太祖手諭說：「海濱之民好鬥，裕伯智謀之士，天下已定，伏處不出，意欲何爲！」這頂大帽子壓下來，秦氏實在毫無辦法，不得不拜書入朝，但太祖要他做官，仍是堅辭不受。明洪武六年的七月二十日，（公曆一三七三年八月八日）在上海逝世，年七十八歲。</p>
<p>從以上的事蹟中，可以看出：（一）秦氏的世籍是高郵，並非道地的上海人。（二）秦氏曾「承元帝爵祿十餘年」，因此不願意「背之而起」；做明朝的官。</p>
<p>一筆糊塗賑</p>
<p>至於道位秦裕伯先生怎麽變成上海縣的城隍神呢？這其中就含糊得很。據消同治六年（一八六七年）有一位秦裕伯的後裔秦溫毅，曾做過一篇「上海縣城隍說」，其中謂秦裕伯卒於洪武六年，計聞於朝，太祖震悼日：「生不爲我臣，死當衛吾土，着即勅封爲上海縣城隍神。」並且說了許多讚揚的話，最後說秦裕伯做上海城隍，理固宜然。</p>
<p>但是確切的證據，却是一些也沒有。比較可靠些的，有曹一士的上海縣城隍神頌，其中說：「…諧封顯佑伯制辭，自洪武二年正月，（按：明太祖在洪武二年　　　　　封京都及天下城隍神，各州封侯，各縣封伯。」而公於是年始爲待制。…」</p>
<p>問題就在這裏：秦裕伯的被封爲上海縣城隍是洪武二年的事，而秦裕伯却是在洪武六年方才死的，世上那有人還沒有死就被封做「城隍老爺」的道理？　的遞城備考中也說：</p>
<p>「考公（指秦裕伯）洪武二年始拜待制，……則前此又有何人以主之耶？宋人本立城隍祠於淡井廟，自公爲神，而宋元之神受代去耶？皆不可解。</p>
<p>所以秦裕伯的爲上海城隍，在淸代初年，已成疑案。而且秦氏生前旣不願做明朝的官，死後想必他也不願受明朝的封吧！但是這些都無關宏旨，正如秦溫毅的文中說：「天下之城隍類然，而爰獨疑於公？」</p>
<p>於是五百餘年來，一直是「秦家天下</p>
<h3>姑妄言之　姑妄聽之　遺老談靈蹟</h3>
<p>在有淸一代的傳說中，這位城隍頗爲一般善男信女所崇拜。就在現在，還可以時常聽到白髮遺老們，含着旱烟管，娓娓不倦地對年靑人談着「城隍老爺」顯靈的故事。　據說，在順治十年的秋天，海寇犯境，蘇州總兵王璟，督戰失敗，被民衆羣起攻擊，適巡撫周國柱統兵來滬，王燝深恐老百姓暴露他望風而逃的失敗情况，故意在巡撫面前，反誣全上海民衆，說他們都與賊人勾結，巡撫信以爲眞，共同議定：從浦南直至靜安寺的居民，一律屠殺。他們本預備第二天就開始，那知當天晚上，周巡撫得了一夢，夢見城隍神「朱袍象笏，嚴立階下，直視搖首者再。」下一天周巡撫便取銷前令，而上海居民，賴以保全。</p>
<p>諸　此類的神話，在褚文洲的滬城備者中記載得很詳細的。如康熙年間，有布商失款，由城隍托夢破獲，某一次邑令傅公之孫，被賊人所殺，也由城隍托夢破案。洪楊軍興，城隍爲「保境安民」，而時常「顯靈」，言之者更好像「鑿鑒有據」。</p>
<p>不管那些神話是如何的荒誕不經，在茶餘酒後，大家仍作爲談話的資料。</p>
<p>城隍廟的小世界，現在亦受着「時代潮流」的影響，「美式配備」的「世界聯合商塲」奪去子往日古色古香的舊玩意了。　（本報攝）</p>

<h3>世界學生日紀念會　昨晨在市體育館舉行　廿四國學生熱烈參加　京市大會分電盟國領袖等致敬</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕德軍於此次大戰攻佔捷克後，大施其　殺和逮捕鎮壓捷克學生之運動。一九三九十一月十七日起，復對布拉格及捷克各大城市學生及教授，加以瘋狂殺害，死難者達數千人，大部分學生被拘八集中營，一切教育事業機關，均遭停閉。世界學生大會，於一九四一年，規定此日（十一月十七日）爲世界學生日。上海市各校學生，爲紀念此歷史上可歌可泣之一頁，特於昨晨假陜西路上海市體育館，舉行上海市學生紀念「世界學生日」大會。參加者，有：中·英·美·囌·捷克·西班牙·匈牙利·葡萄牙·瑞士·瑞典·希臘·印度·丹麥·義大利等廿四國學生，約五千餘人，由夏大程之遠，約大張若靈，民濟王承掞及交大，復旦等代表五單位，及英·美·蘇·法·捷五國學生代表各一人，擔任主席團。來賓到有吳市長·方主委吳主任·及各大學校長等。會場佈置，至爲壯嚴，場內遍懸各國國旗，壁柱張貼中·英·法·蘇各國文字之標語，大看臺背後，繪有四幅中英美蘇四國領袖巨像。演講臺圍以表白紅竹布，背景則爲巨幅黨國旗及國父遺像，臺前置有花盆，臺上插有廿四國國旗。</p>
<p>江主席報告</p>
<p>大會於九時三十分開始，主席團就位後，即由警察同業隊奏樂，并唱國歌。行禮如儀後，首由主席復大學生江英生報告大會意義，略謂：「捷克學生犧牲，是有代價的，納粹主義已在人類的歷史上留下了最可恥的記錄，希望大家不避艱苦，爲爭取世界和平而繼續努力。」</p>
<p>吳市長演講</p>
<p>繼由吳市長演講：「今天舉行世界學生日紀念大會，使我想起了古人的一句話，「爲大人者不失赤子之心」，因爲只有青的頭腦，是乾凈的白紙，一入社會，便受了環境的渲染。全世界的青年，都希望有一個康樂的世界，便必須永遠保持純潔的心，追求真理，而不受黨派的利用。因此我們要擁護國大，希望改戰場爲政場。」外賓多人，亦發表演說，大　致強調國際合作，與世界和平。</p>
<p>方主委致詞</p>
<p>後由市黨部方主委致詞稱：「今日紀念世界學生日，值得歡欣鼓舞！發揮全世界青年的力量，可以促成世界的進步與和平。青年是國家民笑中最寶貴的份子，任何國家若沒有優秀的青年學生，必將滅亡。目前我們需要的是和平，統一，民主，但今天我們欲鞏固世界和平，必須先求中國之統一，團結，和平，民主。然而中共代表周恩來卻在報上說，共黨的生存是打出來的，試問今日的世界還須打嗎？國民黨召開國大，是希望還政於民，但是共黨卻阻止它。今後希望青年能擁護國大，以求和平，誰破壞和平，誰就是我們的敵人。」</p>
<p>吳主任意見</p>
<p>最後由青年團吳主任紹澍發表三點意見：（一）歷史告訴我們，青年是反侵略的先鋒，希望青年們仍能爲反侵略的領導者。（二）青年是不怕犧牲的，所以青年是保衛民族的主力軍。（三）凡意圖摧殘青年的，終必將失敗。末由大會通過「告全國青年同學書」，并高呼口號。大會直至十一時餘始散。會後并舉行大遊行，隊伍由上海市警察同樂隊，及童子軍樂隊引導，中美英蘇四強領袖畫像曁廿四個單位之聯合國國旗全體出動，行列由陜西南路體育館出發，經中正中路，同孚路，轉入南京路，至外灘黃浦公園散隊，茲將大會告全國青年同學書，探誌如次：</p>
<p>告青年同學書</p>
<p>同學們：今天我們又再度逢到這一慘痛紀念的日子！自從一九四〇年起，我們每遇到一年的十一月十七日，就禁不住要引起無限悲憤的感慨，我們回想到德國法西斯　武主義者的酷舉暴行，對於人類生命的摧殘，對世界文化的打擊，就不由得義憤填胸，髪指皆裂，這是怎麼樣的一個世界？怎麼樣的一個時代，每一個有良心的人，誰還能够忍耐？誰還能够坐視？更何況我們這一些在世界科學文化教育下的青年學生？我們自從一九四一年開始，選擇這一個德國侵略者慘酷屠殺捷克學生破壞捷克教育機關的日子，作爲我們共同的紀念日，決不是爲了旁的目的，我人間爲了勇敢地肩負起維護和平維護文化的任務。我們大聲的呼出國際合作，消滅侵略，謀求幸福，促進文化等等口號，我們堅決地同法西斯蒂的狂熖作門爭，同侵略主義的毒素作搏戰，假如我們還有工作的話，我們的工作不是別的，只是反侵略，反屠殺。假如我們的工作還有使命的話，那麼我們的使命不是別的，一切是爲了人類的幸福，一切是爲了世界的文化。我們的工作終於不會失敗，我們的使命終於得能完成。全世界青年學生，參加在反侵略反屠殺的門爭中，各自發揮了至高無上的犧狂精神，終於把我們共同的敵人打倒，從去年五月起傳國侵略主義者垮臺了，從去年九月起，日本帝國主義者亦相繼滅亡此後，世界重復見到光明，時代重復趨入正軌，一年多來，和平的基礎不知道鞏固了多少，人類幸福的曙光亦已經在我們眼前湧現，歷史再度證明了「正義」的必獲勝利，今後人類應該可以在它的號召下向前邁進！</p>
<p>但是同學們：我們不諱言，目前戰爭的暗潮并不會退卻，國際間的猜忌亦不會消滅，和平雖已在握，而合作則尚屬難期。在這樣一個處境之下，人類的良知，無疑的又將受到空前的磨練，怎樣使不必要的隔閡可以溝通，莫須有的偏見得能掃除，這又該是我們世界學生的共同責任。我們爲了增進人類更多的幸福，促成世界文化的合理發展，我們還得繼續過去反侵略反屠殺的理念與意志，來作積極的建設性的努力。</p>
<p>同學們：我們大家都相信國際合作，鞏固和平，是目前最切要的事業。爲了社會的進步，生命的持續，我們絕對不允許再有戰爭，讓我們繼續携手，爲了人類的幸福和世界的文化而努力，正義一定會勝利的！我們大家一起高呼口號：（一）全世界學生聯合起來！（二）鞏固世界和平！（三）加強國際合作！（四）中化民國萬歲！（五）聯合國萬歲！上海市學生紀念「世界學生日」大會啟，十一月十七日。</p>
<p>京市紀念大會</p>
<p>「本報南京十七日電」十七日爲「世界學生日」，京市各校學生及職業青年團體代表二千餘人，九時半集於大眾戲院，舉行紀念會，　樂開會後，奏聯合國國歌，即由主席金女大學生曹婉如致詞，縷述世界學生日之淵源，并稱今後青年學生應有永遠「消滅戰爭」及「發揚民主自由精神」兩信念，繼由各校學生，及法國青年代表致詞。青年團中央宣傳處長李俊龍，亦即席致詞，強調青年力量之堅強，勗勉學生，提高警覺性，聯合世界學生，爲和平奮門。最後通過大會向蔣主席致敬電，向捷克青年致敬電，向斐國領袖致敬電，向倫敦世界青年協會致敬電，共四通。十時半，禮成散會。</p>

<p>請克夫人演講</p>
<p>繼請克利浦斯夫人演講，克夫人略謂：「今晚能得到這裏來參觀，我們覺得非常高興，我看到各位於白天長時間的工作後，晚上還能到這裏來讀書，對於這種精神，我覺得非常欽佩。各位在這裏讀了書後，在生活上必能有所改進，希望各位勸別的朋友也能來此讀書。尤其高興的，知道各位於讀書以外，還能帮助學校搭置房屋，我對於援華工作，我覺得很滿意，我將回國去，告訴國人，平時的工作應該和戰時一樣，希望能够發揚光大，謝謝各位的歡迎。」</p>

<h3>青白隊長行動失檢　東華一對零告捷　四戰四勝東華表演甚佳　逸園二萬球迷大動公憤</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本季足球聯賽甲組第一循環爭覇戰，東華青白兩巨頭昨日下午會師逸園，東華四戰四勝，以一比零擊敗青白，報復上季敗挫之辱，上半時雙方各無紀錄。昨日初冬氣候，風和日暖，球迷約二萬餘人，惟秩序良佳，亦屬難得，爲本季足球賽初次盛況。惜下半時比賽中途，因青白隊長許文奎行動粗暴，致引起觀眾大爲不滿，殊深遺憾。</p>
<p>東華大有中興氣象</p>
<p>東華昨日踢來甚佳，大有中興氣象，前鋒攻勢頗盛，除阿戴與孫錦順已現老態外，兩翼李垚賈幼良大爲活躍，益以韓龍海，若非臺寳卡在，青白恐早已不守。前鋒之外，後衛亦見賣力，莊友仁有從來未有之好，自守門以至中衛綫，皆能稱職也。回顧青白，雖有晉秋亭自港飛來，但昨毫無作爲，自上半時李義臣與張邦綸一碰受傷後，前鋒遂見渙散，惟守則甚力，嚴士鑫尤見鶴立鷄群，臺寳卡旣傷，秦必高相差甚遠，故昨日爲一攻一守之比賽，東華之勝，似非倖致。</p>
<p>阿奎粗魯激動公憤</p>
<p>下半時十五分鐘後，青白被東華攻入一球，而李養臣臺寳卡高保正又相繼受傷，青白球員行動漸見粗魯，卒致隊長許文奎竟有意以雙足向張林根猛踏，幸未受重傷，裁判員以勇氣不足，爲維持秩序，未物品嚴厲處罰，二萬觀眾，則激起公憤，相率以橘皮等向阿奎投擲，呼聲四起，羣對青白大表不滿，勝負常事，以身爲隊長，而出此越軌行動，深爲可惜，尤以眾怒難犯，民意之制裁爲可畏。賽畢青白隊員由警察保護出場。無運動員精神道德者，不啻受一當頭棒喝。</p>
<p>東華犯攻各無紀錄</p>
<p>裁判何春暉，下令開賽，青白開球，受阻而返，東華乘機崛起，攻勢甚盛，五分鐘時，李垚勾中，龍海一腳，越野而去，李垚二度猛射，均被臺竇卡抱住，十六分鐘時，龍海廿碼外猛叩，低而且急，不幸適中橫木，此後仍是東華之天下，惟屢攻不入，徒喚奈何。卅一分鐘時，青白來襲，李司開帶球疾進，邦綸衝出，與李互撞，義臣受傷倒地暫告離場，東華乘虛猛襲，幼良二次角球，落點亦好，小李垚妙叩，臺竇卡臥地抱住，化險爲夷，卅九分鐘時，義臣重行進場，負傷參戰，二分鐘後，孫錦順鐵腿遠掃，球出如矢，臺捨命挽救，李垚上前，與臺相撞，臺因之足部受傷，秦必高上場替出，未幾前半告終，雙方零對零，各無所獲</p>
<p>龍海一球奠定天下</p>
<p>休息一過，兩陣再圖，東華阿戴小休，黃克厚掛印中帥，青白亦以雪雪維太代表出李司開，十二分鐘時，孫老錦挑送前方，龍海竄上，略盤數武，力蹴入綱，東華旣開紀錄，四座歡聲雷動，爆竹高鳴，情緒熱烈。同時高保正因傷離場，是後青白舉動漸見粗魯，而許文奎故意踏傷張林根之舉動遂起，有失運動道德，觀眾嘩然，不久保正傷愈再行臨陣，青白進攻，許文奎勾中（時阿奎改充右翼），雪維太加上一射，惜高出尺許，未有所獲，青白爲憎強攻勢，第以鋒綫散漫，難挽頹勢，迨終場笛聲長鳴，東華以一比零力取青白。</p>

<h3>黑白隊表演失望　昨晚再敗於汕隊　黑白女子隊又勝雪白</h3>
<p>黑白籃球隊昨晚因蕭華陀之未曾出場，卅二比廿六又敗於汕隊，上半時黑白以十三比十二佔先一分。女子賽，競爭相當劇烈，雪白上半時力戰，以各廿一與黑白戰成平手，惜下半時因力盡而敗，雙方表演，俱甚佳美可觀。結果爲四十四比卅一，黑白女獲勝。第一節九比九各無勝負，上半時各得廿一分。下半時雪白開始落後，第三節卅一比廿三，最終比數四十四比三十一，黑白表演良好，雪白昨能猛抗，亦大出意外。</p>

<h3>強佔房屋運動在英國</h3>
<p>— 本報倫敦特約記者雪岩</p>
<p>十月廿日航訊</p>
<p>英國政情，目前木可很平靜，但是爲了幾個本身並不相連貫，而也能互相影響的問題，再加政黨活動者參與其間鼓吹，也便掀起風波，成爲各方目光所注射的焦點。如强佔（Squatting）和建築房屋問題，華萊士在紐約的演說，史達林答覆英國星期時報記者問題以及和這些間題相呼應的共產黨所發動的接二連三的示威運動。</p>
<p>在戰爭期間，住宅幾乎停建，再加上敵機的轟炸，房屋已不敷應用，現在戰事旣了，士兵復員，房屋問題，始終嚴重，再加上經此劇變，許多人的職業，有所改變，隨着職業的改變，住處因之選移，這本是常情，但因此使住宅的分配，更失去平衡，也是事實。夏去冬來，本來在海濱渡假日的人，紛紛回倫敦來過年，房屋問題的嚴朮性，因此更尖銳。其中有一部分窮人，本來寄住在若干爲政府所徵用的房屋中，現在徵用期滿，政府要把房屋發還原主，令他們遷出，向尋住宅。這項通知，也並不是突然的，早已是在一年前就預吿了，不過目前是到達了最後限期，所以要强制執行了。實際受到彩響的，據估計的爲一千戶。這一千戶爲抗議起見，遊行示威一次，即目動遷人若干戰前爲最奢侈的旅館，作戰期間爲政府徵川作爲招待外賓的招待所，但目前空着，　準備於修整後發回原主營業。這是强佔遝動的起源，本是很自然的。這運動發生後，社會的反響很好，很多人同情這項運動，認爲與其議業主去發財，不如讓窮人去安居。在初次出發强佔時，很多出差汽車，自動去幫他搬家，不收分文，還有很多觀衆，自動捐款救濟，立時捐集的數額，也相當大。誰知此風一開後，不滿現實者，很多起來效允（現在加拿大和法國都已有同樣運動），强佔事件，日有數十起。共產黨認爲有機可乘，遂參加糾織，作有計劃的强佔，到處發動羣衆大會，以此爲攻　政府的資料。這件事要是發生在殖民地，到是好辦，祗要警察放幾槍，捕幾個人，或則放放催淚彈之類，大概可以解決。但在這裏，如無法院的拘票，警察是不能捉人的，放槍或放催淚彈更是不可想像之事。政府對策，祗是切斷被估房屋的電綫，（但水仍供給）派警察去堵住可能被佔房屋的大門，通知無屋住民，到政府去登記，由政府黴用房屋分配。最後由政府收集證據，具狀向法院控吿爲首五人，以其組織集團，非法張佔私產，破壞治安。據記者從另方面探悉，政府所控吿的人數和罪名，都是很輕的，這正是政府並無多大把握的緣故。因爲組織集團，破壞治安等法律是很複雜的，可以作各種解釋，法院不一定受理，政府不一定勝訴，比較有把握的是强佔私產一條，但似應由業主出頭。經過法院兩個星期調查後，認爲政府所控屬實，出五張拘票，拘捕被控之五人，於是政府的尊嚴，靠法院來保障了。這裏我們所應注意的，不但是法院在實際上的權威，爲社會尊重，其在精神上的權威，尤其重要。在　　法院有所決定之前，强佔事件，日日發生，政府與共產黨，都努力宣傳，爭取社會的同情，因此社會的輿論，也不一致。有人認爲共產黨故意和政府倒台，但有人認爲政府確是措置失常。待法院的決定一宣布，輿論立刻一致，認爲旣經法院調査屬實，自是共黨故意倒台，連共產黨的黨報，立論都改變口吻了。強佔房崖運動，至此吿一段落。但如有人認爲這是五個共產黨徒被捕後的結果，那是不確的，因爲這五人自始即交保，在審判定案以前，行動仍自由。問題是自經法院受理後，是非有了標準，社會視聽改變，不再同情倒台的人了。失去了社會的同情，共產黨也就偃旗息鼓了。</p>
<p>在法院宣布其能一度之日，許多報紙，標題都說政府獲得一大勝利。但政府黨的機關報每日前鋒報却特別著訓辯正。說共產黨倒台問題，雖已解決，政府却並不引爲勝利，反之，仍有許多人民，住屋問題，無法解決，政府深以爲憾，充分感覺責有未盡，當加倍努力。接着政府就發表加緊完成建築住宅的計劃。根據所發表的目標，在聖誕節前，倫敦一區，當完成住宅四十三萬餘所，其中十八萬餘所，是永久性的住宅，其餘則爲臨時性的住宅。據一政府發表，上述房屋，七月底前就計劃動工了，現在更加緊完成。但據共產黨表示，這是强佔運動的結果，政府才把建築住宅問題，又列爲建設計劃中的首要項目了。</p>
<p>政府耶誕節前加緊完成新屋計劃</p>
<p>在國際方面，美國前商務部長華萊士在紐約的演說，主張美國應與蘇聯合作，而不爲英國帝國主義者火中取栗。和史塔林對英國星期時報記者發表談話，謂英蘇應增強政治的商務的以及文化的聯繫。這二伯緊接着的事，在英國都發生很深刻的印象，尤其給英國的共產黨以很大衝動。近來共產黨一再發動羣衆大會，遊行示威，差不多都以這二件事和住屋問題，作爲宣傳的資料。　關於華萊士的演說，英輿論界初時不太重視，不重視的原因，第一，英國知道演說的動機，是爲了競選的號召。其次，就今因國際形勢的實際環境講，覺得華萊士的演說，不切事實，因爲在目前的各個國際會議中，美蘇衝突，多於英蘇衝突。但這演證所引起的後果，倒予英國很深印象。杜魯門總統的出爾反爾，在英國人看來，似乎不合政治家風度。華萊士最後不得不去職，允令人感覺美國反蘇勢力之强大，至於史達林的答問，不找美國記者而找英國記者，本身已有英重於美之感。再史達林所說希望增强英蘇政治，商業及文化聯緊一語，更被視爲蘇聯願與社會主義的英國打交道的證據，本來在英國方面，也頗有一部分人士，早認爲英蘇無不可解決之衝突，在此美蘇爭雄的世界局面中，英國似不妨閃讓一步，不必定要介乎其中，這種見解，目前跟着美蘇衝突的尖銳而似乎更有力了。在這樣的國際風雲轉變之中，共產黨似頗有我道不孤之感。組織羣衆大會，發動游行示威，愈來愈有勁·「別讓美國的銀行家，做全世界的老闆」，「英蘇合作，制止美國資本家的覇制世界」，「全世界都是華萊士的後盾」等語，都是共黨宣傳中最響亮的標語。</p>
<h3>訪國民大會越南馬來亞僑民代表</h3>
<p>— 本報記者黃行天</p>
<p>十三日南京訊</p>
<p>南京的氣候比上海冷，差不多要相差一個月的天氣，可是從西貢來的國大越南僑民代表香玉堂先生，却仍穿着單薄的白色西服，不穿大衣，而仍沒有感到冷的樣子。　着三色帶子的國民大會紀念章，懸在他底白色外套上，更顧得光輝萬分。</p>
<p>香玉堂</p>
<p>香先生是五十開外的人了，可是不着鬍鬚，筏　很健旺，而且也很健談。記者向他作了一次友誼性的訪問，他就吿訴了我很多關於越南的事，過去或現在的，據他自己說：他還是國父發動革命時代的老同志。那時候，南洋一帶是禁止使用「會」的名稱的，國父就以「逸軒閱書報社」的名義在各處設立機構，作爲宣傳革命，鼓吹革命的集社，而「逸軒」就是從「逸仙」轉音來的。他就在西貢的逸軒閱書報社中和革命遝動發生了關係，直到現在，他雖是香達記和華强印務局的老闆，一面仍在負責辦于理越南地區華僑工會的事情，算起來也有三十餘年了。</p>
<p>據香先生說，目前法國統治越南的現狀，簡直比從前日敵統治淪陷區的我國土地還不及，比如西貢吧，被越南土人包圍己很久，包圍圈日漸縮小，他來的時候，離城祇有二公里了。法國軍隊無法與外聯絡，而且也不敢三四人單獨外出。因此，城內糧食起恐慌，到結果，加害到我們僑胞身上，華僑的食鋪米行成了搶刧的對象，情形是很混亂的。安南人恨透了法國人，而法國人却仍想離間中越間的感情，可是他們失敗了，中越人民的情感很好，尤其是安南人對於我們的國軍有很好的印象，而友愛如朋友。</p>
<p>祇有一件事，香先生感到麻煩，就是局勢愈混亂，共產黨在越南的勢力愈大，甚至連總工會都潛入了他們底綜跡。可是他仍很自信他說：「現在有一部份職權，因爲混亂的關係被一些無賴和壞蛋侵佔去了，但不要緊，他們大多做不來事，事做不好，我就很容易把現在的惡　情勢勞變過來。」</p>
<p>至於祖國的情形，他說一般的僑民都非常的關懷，對於那些破壞和平損害國家的人，他們恨之　骨，但是他們竭誠盼望他們歷祖國停止內亂，向建設的路上走去；因此他們對國大的開幕寄予很大的期望。至於他個人，他相信</p>
<p>蔣主席必能遵從國父的遺志，完成建國的大業因而始終竭誠擁護的。</p>
<p>何如羣</p>
<p>國民大會馬來亞僑民代表何如羣先生，他是檳榔嶼廣東曁汀州會館的會長，客屬公會的主席；他自己還在檳榔嶼踏田仔街開了家萬山棧藥行，在馬來亞僑民中是一個很有地位和聲望的僑領。他也是四十開外的人了，鬚髮己呈灰白，但是精神也很好：他說華僑在馬來亞的情形，因爲印度尼西亞人的獨立運動，連累了他們的事業，各方面受損失的很多，但是印尼人和華僑的感情也很好，很多僑民對印尼的命運，寄予最大的同情，有的甚至不顧自己底財產和生命也犧牲在裏面。但是，他們最大的希望還是寄託在祖國身上，讓强大的祖國去支持他們在南洋一帶立足而不受人輕視。因此，他們也深望國內和平，深望這决國大成功，深望山國走向民主的强盛的大道。</p>

<h3>新疆透視（一）</h3>
<p>— 洛杉磯時報特派員德萊克原著　本報編譯室特譯</p>
<p>最近四年來首先遊歷新疆的外國新聞記者，不可謂尠，當以本文作者德萊克爲第一人。德萊克對於新疆內幕之熟悉，較任何記者爲允深·其所撰通訊稿，共六篇，此爲第一篇，關於伊寗叛變以來之新疆政情發展形勢，記述特詳，爰爲迻譯如决：（編者）</p>
<p>資源東流歟？西流歟？</p>
<p>在此白雪皚皚天山背後的中亞細亞境內，中國正爲了她未來的安全從事於英勇的奮鬥，以克服其可怕的地理上的困難及其西方強隣不斷的政治及經濟壓力。記者相信：今後數月中事態的發展，將決定廣大的新疆省的天然富源是否將東流以助中國的復興，還是西流以助蘇聯工業的發展。</p>
<p>今日新疆所處的地位異常危險，這種危局乃是一九四四年九月開始一九四六年一月二日正式結束的武裝回民叛變血案的直接結果。中國軍隊在此次叛亂中大吃敗仗，不祥的預兆至今猶籠罩着新疆的未來的命運。</p>
<p>叛亂開始於山蘇邊境的伊犁區域內，當時有幾個突厥族烏伊格俘虜從烏拉斯太村落的監獄中越獄逃走，發動了醞釀已久的叛變，立刻蔓延到新疆西北部的富饒的伊犁，泰巴加太及阿爾泰各區，現爲叛亂政府首都的新疆邊陲要城伊寗，經八十七天圍困以後，卒於一九四五年一月三十日陷落，接着是中國居民數千遭屠殺之慘。</p>
<p>當伊寗被圍期間，由回民領袖三人指揮軍事。此三人於今年一月及六月六日和現任新疆省主席張治中將軍簽訂和的，他們三人現在同時在新疆政府和叛逆的寡頭政府裏擔任要職。這三人是：卡齊莫夫，三十歲，烏伊格人，諢名「新疆人的靈魂」，現任新疆省副主席。考得札夫，四十歲，烏伊格政治領袖·社耳，卡札克人，在官職上爲張主席派駐伊黎的長官。</p>
<p>伊寗陷落以後，叛黨獲得新的力量，軍隊中增添了現代的砲隊和標着叛黨星月徽章的轟炸機，當冬季進軍在冰天雪地的天山中進行之際,中國軍隊凍死的不計其數，許多隊伍被習於寒冷氣候的土人遊擊隊殲滅了大半。</p>
<p>叛黨由烏伊格人，卡札克人及卡爾歷克蒙古人混合組成，總數的計三萬人，一九四五年春夏之交控制了新疆境內蒙古邊境西北全部地區。他們現在還控制着這區域的全部。他們在一九四五年九月五日攻佔昌蘇要城，後來被阻於離迪化七十哩的孟那斯河岸。張治中將軍即於此時飛往迪化，由蘇聯駐迪化總領事居間和叛黨議和。勝利的回民突變緩和姿態，於本年一月間簽訂了中。烏（伊格）條約的大部份，允許回民在張主席治下西北三佔領區內維持土著回軍六團。</p>
<p>此項條約最後於本年六月六日簽字，七月一日起生效。該條約附有一個極重要的「但書」，即沿叛黨區域的中蘇邊界一帶由中國國民政府的軍隊駐守。可是在和議開始後一年的今日，還不見一個國民政府的士兵駐守在由蘇邊界。　叛黨回民在伊寗區內不掛中國國旗，而懸掛有星月圖徽的白旗，上面加註突厥文「柬土耳其斯坦人民共和國」字樣。伊寗市街中，到處可見穿着綠色制廠佩帶星月徽章的軍人。在伊寗的商店中，蘇聯製造的衣着，糖果，戲衣機等，超過同類的中國貨·中蘇航空公司的運輸攘（美國　）經常飛行於伊寗及阿爾馬阿泰（伊寗以西二百哩蘇聯卡札克斯坦境內的現代都市）之間，正當行融蘇聯式運貨車的公路上面·</p>
<p>由　約可作新疆人民試行自治的媒介，也可作中國本土實行民主的一種工具。該條約給予新疆省人民以種種例外的特權，包括省政府廿五名委員中十五名委員之選舉權，言論和集會自由權，最低納稅及國內外貿易自由，但受中國現行條約的約束。</p>
<p>照目前的形勢觀察，中國企圖獲得新疆西北部的石油·煤·黃金·鎢·皮革及五穀的努力，已遭挫折，一部分的原因是爲了回敎叛黨遲不履行和約的若干條款。結果，迪化和新疆省內中國其他轄境，因缺乏工業與交通設備，而　於可怕的通貨膨脹和貧困的窮境。</p>
<p>可是話得說回來，中國政府對於新疆省的可悲的經濟情形恐怕也得負一半的責任，因爲它還不能供給張主席充分的資金，以修理必要的公路，以及恢復伊甯與迪化間友好關係所必需的經濟援助。</p>
<p>記者回到發生於東九省的同樣的情形。新疆西南邊陲目前的實情，究竟如何，雖不能完全明瞭，但是在一九四四年前，在軍閱盛世才的縱容之下，曾併命搜括新疆資源的侵略性的蘇聯開拓者，是決不慣於遊手好閒的。</p>
<p>新疆面積於東九省，　產和牲畜恐怕也多於東九省。中國喪失這許多資源，就無異美國裏失新墨西哥。亞利桑那，尼伐達，猶他（Utah）數州的資源。</p>
<h3>廠城內外（續完）</h3>
<p>— 本報特派員杭舟</p>
<p>集甯風雪</p>
<p>搭平綏路車由大同北上，出長城以後，便是一片銀白色世界。「冷呵」！一聲低呼從南方來客的心底發出；北方人聽了暗笑：「冷麽？還早哩！眞冷的時候，你這套行頭同夏布一樣。」</p>
<p>我們很幸運：沒有經過這樣的氣候，但在集寗的幾天，我們己嘗到了一點滋味。集寗是綏遠最高的一點，高出水面的一千四百公尺。這是一個二等縣份，設立不久，民九年以前，還只是一個荒凉的村落。由於北方的多事，這小城蛻變爲國防的要地，湯思伯將軍曾在此指揮百靈廟的戰事，築有國防工事。日軍佔領此地，把工事大爲加强。共軍來後，再度修築。因此，集寗的工事，在北方竟赫赫有名。</p>
<p>可是，堅固的工事，對集寗並非幸事，我走在大戰後的集寗的雪地上，像走在一所古剎裏，靜得可怕，殘破得令人心顫！雖然，戰事早己過去，戰爭的氣氛依然存在。黝黑的留落裏隨時發出「口令」的呼聲，劃破死一般的空氣，猶如荒夥裏野豹的嘯喊。據說尙有共軍的殘部散落在鄕村裏。</p>
<p>風徐徐地吹，吹來像一根針，刺人骨髓。二十多位「貴賓」的到來，給歡迎者是一椿重大的麻煩。記者團大都未帶行李。北方人睡的是燒得火辣辣的坑，旁邊還要加一隻煤氣熏天的火爐，窗子是關得緊緊的不透一口風，睡在坑上，活像烤紅薯。第二天起來，唇焦舌爛，背痛腰酸。如果不要燒坑，則非蓋厚被不可。當地人據說一生只洗三次澡，出世一次，結婚一次，死一次·一件衣服從新製到破爛不堪再穿，從不洗滌一次。蚤子之類，如果覺得難堪，反而是一條新聞。當地有借得出的棉被，誰有勇氣使用？我只好向鉅朱林警備司令借了一條軍毯，再蓋上大衣，胡亂地睡去，一早醒來就害傷風。</p>
<p>六日雪停了，但雲仍很低。賀鳳舞縣長特別發動一千個民伕打掃機塲，結果空勞一陣。北平空軍方面來了個電報說：「飛機無法降落」。我們困在招待所裏無聊已極。集寗的民衆聽說記者團來了，三三兩兩跑來陳訴，請願，彷彿把我們常做「領差大臣」或賑災專員」。這個說：「八路軍殺了我一家！」那個說：「八路軍把我的騾子牽走了！」又有一個說：「先生，俺一家老小都活不下去了！」……他們或她們說說都哭起來。我們不知道陪着他（她）們哭好，還是藏起來好，狼狽得很。</p>
<p>歸綏一夜</p>
<p>七日，集寗又下起雨來，還是走不了。歸綏方面電吿那邊氣候較佳，我們便決定去歸綏候機。晚十時開車，路基是才修復的，車行極慢，過卓賢山後，車頭出了軌，幸而立時煞住，未演覆車慘劇，在車上過了極難堪的一夜。翌日，歸綏派車來接，前後延宕了八小時，八日下午五時才到達綏遠的省會。</p>
<p>去年歸綏之戰，歸綏軍民力阻共軍於城外，保持了淸白的身子。當晚，省會各界舉行了一個盛大的宴會和一個精彩的遊藝晚會，除了歡迎記者團外，同時歡迎黃河水利委員會的幾位專家和從事慈善事業的幾位外籍敎徒。在晚曾上，省府秘書長于純齋氏任主席致詞說：「卅餘位嘉賓同時蒞臨，是歸綏十五年來未有的盛事！」他的演詞中有這樣幾句話：「偏遠而荒凉的綏遠，現已處在國防的第一綫，由於物資上和文化上的條件不够，這第一綫，需要全國人士的注意，來開發，建設，加强它！」</p>
<p>在歸綏僅留一晚，九日上午九時，我們搭乘北平派來飛機折返大同，換乘已修竣之專機南航，於下午三時返抵南京，結束了這决旅行·（十二日）</p>
<h3>英·美·法制憲歷程</h3>
<p>本報資料室</p>
<p>英</p>
<p>英國的憲法，要追溯到一二一五年所頒布的大憲章，道是在貴族與市民的壓力之下產生的。根據大憲章的規定，設立國會。國會分上下兩院，上議院議員，爲貴族。大地主及朝廷大臣，下議院則由中小貴族及平民的代表組織而成。下議院有決定各種賦稅，法制，及通過徵稅案之權，其權力較上議院爲大。此爲英國憲政的開端。</p>
<p>自國會成立以後，國王和國會屢起衝突。當時英國尙沒有確定的賦稅制，國庫旣不充裕，政府便想出種種新的歛錢方法，要國會通過增稅案，因此影響到納稅人的利益。國會常常和政府反對，政府解散國會，也不止一次。從十三世紀至十七世紀上半期，四百多年中，政府再三壓迫國會，引起了組成國會的資產階級和中等階級的憤恨·一六二八年，國會向國王提出權利請願書，其時査利一世，因急急要國會通過新增稅案，不得不承認下來。但未及一年，國會又遭解散，國王獨斷獨行，橫徵暴歛，更使全國人民不滿，引起了一六四二年的革命。</p>
<p>革命之戰，歷二十餘年，一直到査利二世復辟後，貴族和資產階級才分權而治·一六七九年，國會通過了人身保護法案，對於民權保障，較前確定。威廉三世登基後，在一六八九年，國會提出權利法案，經國王批准，國王的權力，便大受限制，而國會的權力，則大大提高，足以支配政府的政策。從此代表大地主和貴族的保守黨，和代表新興工商業中等階級的自由黨，更迭地掌握了英國政權。</p>
<p>一七〇一年，通過澄淸法案，規定王位繼承程序。一九一一年，又通過議會法案，增高下議院權力。故英國憲法，成文者少而不成文者反多。</p>
<p>美</p>
<p>一七七六年七月四日，北美十三州，正式發表獨立宣言，興英國脫離關係。其時各州已擬設一永久政府，但因軍事正在進行，無暇及此，而各州間未能互相信任，難於實現。遲至一七七七年，始由各州代表商洽，採用「聯邦的章」。此計劃送交各邦審査批准時，爭辯甚久，延至一七八一年，全體通過，乃得實行。</p>
<p>依的章規定，各州仍保留其主權。中央僅設一會議，代表各州，而非代表人民。中央方面，並無行政，立法與司法各機關來執行會議中所決定的法律。各州設州長，州長的權力又很小。其立法機關亦採兩院制。各州的選舉權，僅限於有財產者或納稅者。行之不久，漸覺其不很健全。</p>
<p>至一七八七年，乃有五州代表集會，商討改組中央政府的計劃，結果召集大會，修正「聯邦的章」。是年五月，各州代表齊集，此即歷史上所謂憲法會議者是。商議至四月之久，經過多决激烈的爭辯，至九月間，新憲法纔產生。於一七八八年由各州同意通過，經法定州數的批准，一年之後，成爲美國的正式憲法。</p>
<p>奴隸制度本來和美國的獨立精神是不相容的，北部各州在獨立後不久，就把奴隸制度廢止了。但在南部各州認爲對於維特農業，仍有需要，加以保留。故在國會中常發生自由州和奴隸州的衝突，終於爆發了南北戰爭·一八六五年，南北戰爭結束。一八六六年，修改關於憲法上人民權益的規定：凡生長或同化的人，一律爲公民。白人和奴隸，同樣可以有參政權·一八六九年·國會又通過了憲法第十五條約修正案，規定不得奴役膚色不同的人，以剝奪其權利。此美國制憲經過之大概也。</p>
<p>法</p>
<p>法國最初有一「三級會議」，代表僧侶，貴族和資產階級，第三級的資產階級人數最多，包括的範圍又最廣。一七八九年，召集「三級會議」時，第三級在另一處的會塲中，用了巧妙的手段，邀集其他兩級代表，從事選舉審査，但因特權代表，盛氣凌人，拖延了六星期，尙未開會，致使第三級代表心中不滿。因此又產生了代表法國人民的國民會議，此乃由第三級改組而成的。</p>
<p>國民會議和國王的衝突，發生了法國革命，發表了人權宣言，表示國民會議的代表，對於全體國民的利益，已作相當保障，此乃歐洲政治史上的一件重要文獻·但第三級中，也有一部份代表是擁護君主的，他們想在君主立憲政體之上，建立他們的新政治。一七九一年，草成憲法。但至一七九二年，法蘭西共和國終於在鬥爭中威立了，主張君主立憲的，宣吿失敗。一七九三年，產生了法蘭西共和國的第一次憲法。不久此憲法又宣吿廢止，至一七九五年，再公佈一種憲法。</p>
<p>其後法國經過拿破侖之稱兵，路易十八之復辟，至一八四八年，再發生革命，成立了第三次的法國共和政治·就在這一年，編定憲法，選舉總統，法國的新憲法又完成了。</p>
<p>在第二次世界大戰中，法國由戴高樂將軍之領導，在民族復興的旗幟下，努力反抗貝當的傀儡政府。不久，法國軍隊，重蒞祖國的領土，建立了第四次法蘭西共和國。感到這五十年前的所制定的憲法，已不適用，是以又完成了他們更新的憲法。這新憲法是在今年十月十五日公佈的·</p>

<h3>中國能做的東西</h3>
<p>— 編者</p>
<p>最近英國凱新頓維多利亞及亞爾倍博物院舉行一個「英國能够做的東西」展覽會＂Britain　can　Make　it”Exhibition英皇，英后，都去觀光。</p>
<p>這在性質和意義上和國貨展覽相仿，不渦他們所用的字面範圍較廣，並且有以英國能够製浩引爲光榮。</p>
<p>其實在中國工業界，也不乏埋頭苦幹的戰士，所有出品，可以媲美舶來，而且可以替代舶來。例如調味品中的「味精」可以替代外來的調味粉；藥品中有「新惜花散」可以替代「新洒爾佛散」；「胰島萌」可以替代「因蘇林」等，這種出品，可以說是中國工業的光榮。</p>
<p>目前新藥業雖則受到外貨傾銷的嚴朮打擊，但仍有一部份藥廠，在努力開闢新路，例如信誼藥廠最近有治吸血病及黑熱病特效藥「聖露賜銻新」問世；楊氏化學治療研究所有亞米諾酸混合劑「胖得榮」問世。這種動作，同然是謀取自身生存，求取技術進步的方式，但不辭艱苦的精紳，却是値得稱許的。</p>
<p>今後的工業界，似乎很可以拿「製造中國人能够做的東西以替代舶來，」作爲生產的方針。</p>
<h3>讀本年棉產估計後</h3>
<p>— 季君勉</p>
<p>本年棉產估計，經農林部棉產諮詢委員會及全國棉紡織業聯合會發表了，雖然僅是初步的佔計數字，到最後一次估計時，說不定還有變動，然而本年的棉况，從這表上我們已可見其大概了。</p>
<p>這次發表的數字，包括十二省，較著名的棉產區域已都在其中，計棉田三千四百十一萬八千一百六十九畝，產棉七百八十九萬五千六百十祖。無論在棉田面積或產量方面，都趨進步的過程，這進步且不算慢；因棉田面積較三十四年增加百分之四十，與二十六年較固然還差百分之四十五，產量方面增加了百分之五十七，比二十六年猶少百分之三十八，總算很可喜的事情。</p>
<p>有這標的成績，固由於各方努力提倡，推廣所致，也由於八年敵僞侵境，民衆們在艱苦由度日，衣被不週，一且天日重光，衣被需求甚殷甚切，提高了棉農植棉的興趣，而且今年天氣沒有特殊的大變故，雖然該報吿上有「雨暘不調」的話，其實僅是局部的，災情亦輕。基於上述的三因，增加的數字，本有更大的可能，無如「遍地烽火，糧食缺乏，棉農不願多植棉；及交通阻隔，生產成本昂貴，產銷兩方，均未走上康莊大道」的原因給予他們的限制。從這數字上，我們也略得暗示——華中七省比華北似乎略較安定（僅比較的安定）所以增產也是華中多於華北。</p>
<p>今年棉產量雖有增進，預想一部分要爲農民自己的消費，不能有大部分被工廠吸進做原料，在外棉源源進口，大家都望着國棉自給自足聲中，相差還很遠！即退一步說，若以紡「廿支紗一日夜每錠消耗原棉一·一七七磅，那末每月就現有錠數估計消耗五七〇七六三〇磅，即五一七九六市担，全年以開工三首日計，需一五，八三九，〇二四市担」計算的話，產銷相差九十萬担，比去年祗少差了十萬祖，何况有產地消費和不良品質，不合爲工廠原料者在內呢！</p>
<p>假設今年一般需衣被消費原　者，已得初步滿足，和今年棉價不能和其他糧價成正常比例，則明年增產也不一定會一帆風順的吧。</p>
<p>我們看了這一個報告，和看看周圍的環境，實在有一則以喜和一則以懼的盛覺。</p>
<h3>中國生產品的出口問題</h3>
<p>— 影呆</p>
<p>目前中國生產成本的高昂，其主要的原因甚多；遝輸不便，政治問題尙未解決，凡此皆足影響國貨的出口。中國的工業，並不遭遇工人薪給高超問題，而生　的成本，却高於各國。因爲同樣一種貨品，在中國製造，其按巧的工人，每較他國爲少。根據職爭以前的統計，一千架紗錠，紡成二十支的紡，其所需工人的比例，蘭開夏爲六，美國爲六。一，日本爲九·三，中國爲九·九，而紡成三十支的紗，蘭開夏爲四，日本爲八，中國爲八·五。這就表示同樣的一種產品，其所費人工，中國已比海外增加一倍。日本的所以能和海外競爭，因爲有銀行，運輸業，和紗廠實一行合作，並使工人如奴隸般的工作。這些，在中國都沒有的。</p>
<p>因此，今後如中國欲獲戰前的海外市塲，就在訓練技巧工人，使生活程度低減，以求生產成本的降落。而運輸問題，更當促其圓活便利。目前中國所遭遇的尙在繼續下去的通貨膨脹問題，比較奇特，因爲不但小國的貨幣在膨脹，就是美元亦在中國膨脹。這就因兩種貨幣，價格有上落，是企圖竟取一解決經濟問題的方法。然而，唯一的良政，却在改進中國的對外貿易，雖然有許多替代品與之競爭，但中國貨品的出口問題，前途並非無望。第一，貨品的本質必須提高，有時中國貨在海外和他國的產品相比，不在售價，而在質的少差。至於運輸問題，有若千外商經營的航路暫時停頓，這是爲政治而非爲經濟。中國的工商界，可少待一二年，自會改善的。</p>
<p>此外，中國工商界所最感困難的問題，當爲貨幣的不能穩定，幣價在不住貶値，商人無法估計成本，甚至對於美鈔，亦覺如此，因爲美鈔之價，亦有起落。中國對外貿易的高度入超，近來國外遊客的減少，亦爲一因，吾則彼等可在中國費用很多金錢。由於目前的政局不定，遝輸不便，使外人之欲來華者，裏足不前·無論如何，今日中國商業上的阻礙，政治常重於經濟。戰後的中國，其在國際，能獲如此地位，常爲夢想所不及。其在世界政治上所處地位，尤其重要。世界正需要中國市塲，而中國的需要世界市塲，更爲股切。在二十世紀時代，沒有一國能够孤立，就長蘇聯，他的經濟機構完全和各國不同者，亦不能孤立，而正企岡取得世界市塲，別國當然不必論了。</p>
<h3>生產珍聞</h3>
<p>— 紹表</p>
<p>廿五年前在西方黃荳還不爲人所知，現在不僅被認爲自然界最富滋養的食物，並且作爲一種工業原料。</p>
<p>美國現在可用以黃荳製造）除虫粉，印刷墨水，防水材料，油布一類的化合物。福特汽車廠且曾製成一輛試騐汽車，車身大部用黃荳做原料。</p>
<p>美國奇異電氣公司新發明一種自動電溫毛毯法。在雙層羊毛中裝有極細電條兩條，一種電流發熱，使毛毯溫暖，另一電條則測量毛毯溫度，並與一個三燈電子控制器相運接，可隨室內溫度之高低而調節適常溫度。此種毛毯之重量很輕，現正大量生產，每條價格約美金四十元。</p>
<h3>工業技術發展原因</h3>
<p>— 雪芃</p>
<p>現代技術發展，固然不能不歸功於現代技術乃基於科學的知識，但又不能不歸功於現代社會對於技術的尊敬，歡迎及獎勵。</p>
<p>（一）現代技術的科學性由此事實可生下列的影響：A關於按術知識容易客觀化而促其移動及普及。B使技術的知識體系化，對一般的因果關係，予以探討。又解決一問題，立成爲解決他問題的關鍵，同時又提出其他新疑問，使硏究的發展容易進行。</p>
<p>（二）現代社會對於技術的發明的歡迎及獎勱現代社會思潮，對於物資的技術的發展具有莫大的興趣，因此技術上的發明及改良，皆受到至高的尊敬與歡迎。凡研究技術者絕不受至社會的壓迫，任何人皆有研究的自由。打破封建的束縛，確立產業自由。競爭制度下企業者爲克服其競爭者，爲獲得特殊利潤，爲開拓新部門，乃極力歡迎並期待技術的新發明。最顯明表現的，A各種技術的敎育機關，公立技術研究機關等，B大企業或經濟團體等所設立的各種硏究機關，調査宣專機關等。</p>
<p>但是於今日高度的獨佔化組織之下，營利的欲望常常不依技術改良而依更安易的方法達之，即技術的歡迎獎勵常隨競爭作用的退化而懈怠。道也是可以注意的一個現象。</p>
<h3>工商管理概論</h3>
<p>— 徐百益</p>
<p>雇員心理</p>
<p>（一）誠實</p>
<p>在企業紐織裏，誠實爾個字，可以說是拒絕一切外來的引誘，不做有害於企業組織的舉動，如做事忽略，做壞了東西，不去報吿等。</p>
<p>測騐方法：我們可以詢問他對於各種舉動的意見，例如：</p>
<p>甲，當我們坐在電車上，想不付車票，儘是看報，居然那賣票的人被我們瞞過了，這舉動是好的，還是壞的？</p>
<p>乙，在公司的工作時間之內，表面上在做事，但實際上是儘量地在把工作遲緩地進行，這種舉動好不好？</p>
<p>（二）忠心　忠心的解釋和誠實是很相仿的，一個企業組織對於職工的概要，是產生與所付的代價相等的勞力，因爲懶惰或耗費時間果然不好，但額外而免費的工作，也不是一個企業組職所需要的，一個能够忠心從事的工作人員，應該得到升級或加薪的酬報。</p>
<p>測騐方法：可以用詢問的方法得到他對於以前所工作過的地方的批評，（如果是一個沒有做過事的職工，可以詢問他他預備怎樣努力，或對於某一業感到怎樣的興趣）</p>
<p>對於忠心一點，一方面還是需要隨時把企業組織的種種情形，如創業時的艱難，已往的歷史等，口頭或用印刷品吿訴職工，使職工對於那企業組織產生信仰而覺得在裏面工作是有很大的希望的。</p>
<p>（三）注意力集中</p>
<p>在做各種工作，注意力是非常需要要的，如果不使注意力集中，就不能使問題解決，在做精巧工作的時候，如果注意力不集中，就容易使貨品不合標準。</p>
<p>測騐方法：出幾個題目，要職工解決，我可以舉一個在家庭上登載過的小難題作爲一個例：</p>
<p>景先生難開上海的時候，忘記把郵政信箱的鑰匙留下來，景太太向他討，他爲上郵寄下來，可是不幾天，景太太又去討了，這是爲什麼呢？（因爲寄到的鑰匙仍舊在信箱裘）</p>
<p>（四）與同事合作</p>
<p>在許多製造廠裏，做成一件貨品，不是一個人可以做成的，必須由谷個工人通力合作，如果一個人的工作不合標準，就要受到影響，所以各個工人間的通力合作是非常重要的</p>
<p>測驗方法：可以考査以前的工作成績，或者用口試的方法詢問以前在別個廠裏工作的時候，有什麽困難，或者爲什麼要離開那個廠，如果他說以前什麽人不能和他合竹，或者別人怎樣不好，如果有這種情形，那末他一定會仍舊發生那種情形。</p>
<p>（五）上進心</p>
<p>上進是人人需要的，如果問問他，他終究爲了求自己的上進，做了什麼工作，一般人者會回答你，他實在什麼事都沒有做，這種人是永遠不會上進的。</p>
<p>測駝方法：可以在表格裏加入下列問題：</p>
<p>甲，你在業餘的時間中，作什麼消遺？</p>
<p>乙，你在業餘的時間中，讀什麽書？</p>
<p>丙，你將來預備在那一方面努力從事？</p>

<h3>序「教授之家」</h3>
<p>— 洪深</p>
<p>一九四三年十二月一個寒冷陰沉的上午，我在重慶中國藝術劇社開始排演宋之的作「春寒」的時候，忽然有個瘦長，行動很不便的靑年，手持一函進「中術」排演室來，我一看信知道是馬彥祥寫的，要求我特許這位曾在靑年劇社見過幾面的「敎授之家」的作者參觀「春寒」的排演，我立刻允許了，隨即繼續我的排演工作。</p>
<p>當時重慶演員正趨向職業化，他們晚間出台演戲，十二時回社，來個宵夜，或打幾圈「沙蟹」，所以到了翌日上午十點排「春寒」的時候，王君早已到塲，而演員總姗姗來遲。以後排演地點更改到重慶靑年館，更改到道門口的銀社，演員遲到雖有改善，但沉默寡言的王君，總是準時來看我排戲。因爲演員不準時到塲，在等待演員的時候，王君便和我談中國戲劇及西洋戲劇，談舊劇與話劇，談舞台經騐與劇本寫作等問題。從歷决談話中，第一我知道他關於中西戲劇及中國舊劇演進到話劇的史實已有相當認識，第二我知道他想到法國去深造，專攻編劇。我那時在復旦大學要授課，又要進城排戲，而朋友又催我寫「五十年來的中國戲劇」，於是我便託王君蒐集此文的資料，那時我正切求甚殷的「新艾學大系」劇本集（內有拙撰長序），即由王君羅致。</p>
<p>「春寒」上演以後，不久我收到王君作長的三萬餘言的「春寒演出紀實」，及兩個劇本，其一即三幕喜劇「健飛的求婚」，寫獨臂靑年軍官已經求得一個礦主女兒的愛，父親總是百般阻撓，但是軍官毫不氣餒，千方百計爲　主破獲破塲奸案，保全了礦主的生命，解除了破塲的危險，終於得到礦主允許和他的女兒結婚。這是個很有趣的喜劇，作者自承係受十七世紀英國喜劇作家薛立敦的不少影響。其决就是獨幕劇「川江夜景」，寫抗戰時期老百姓西撤流亡之時，老婦趙大媽任勞任怨拯救一個棄兒的故事。這個劇本注重氛圍氣的渲染，由此我知道作者對於象徵派大家梅特林是下過一翻硏鑽工夫的。</p>
<p>除此之外，抗戰八年來，作者還寫成「父子相見時」，「敎授之家」，「陪罪」等劇。「父子相見時」係「川江夜景」的續篤，棄兒在重慶醫院遇見他空襲受傷的父親時，自己也因保育院營養不良，身罹重病，奄奄待斃，就要與父親慘別，跟他在船上小產而死的母親，同爲敵軍侵入時期的犧牲者。「敎授之家」作者企圖描繪人類的「此山見來他山高」的習性——生敎授曾憲光誠篤好學，娶了個身份高貴，好交際，不甘冷寂的太太白雲裳，因爲意趣不投，憲光愛上了志同道合的女助敎葉金波，雲裟因爲舊友音樂家郭曉村另有新歡，而曉村也懷疑雲裳與拍賣行老板有染，等到曾葉結合，而葉也有點不耐鄕村的硏究環境時，白郭之間的娛會却消除了，劇本以兩對新夫婦的結合收尾。這個劇本三幕一景，給構相當緊凑，好像很受法國劇本的影響。「陪罪」是一側有趣的笑劇，但就主人公吳榮釗等個性描寫的深刻言，也可作爲一個喜劇看，此劇以中國家庭敎育爲主題，地主吳榮剑對要對傭對貧農作福作威，對獨養兒子却謟媚奉承，稍有不遜，即俯躬陪罪，結果還是擋不住着迷的兒子要上山去求仙學遭·</p>
<p>總觀五劇，三喜二悲，主題漸趨淤入，人物漸趨明顯，對話漸趨生動，結構漸趨緊密。我平時勸靑年作家在創業時應多作喜劇，大槪傑作均非倖致，一般說來，喜劇較難於悲劇；了解獲得喜劇効果的方法，以後寫任何劇本，便易駕輕就熟了。王君五劇份量較重的均喜劇，而成績較好者亦喜劇，可見他走路的方向正確，從他對於戲劇的修養看，他的根基也堅實，繼續努力，前程自未可限量。</p>
<p>這次「春寒」又重新在上海演出了，我懷着愉快的心情，願把作者這五個劇太推薦給我國劇壇及讀者大衆，雖然其中有的劇本，早已與大後方的觀衆相見過了。</p>

<h3>筆尖——紀念一個朋友的死</h3>
<p>— 鮑雨</p>
<p>只要我見到鋼筆上挺硬的筆尖，就會馬上連想到一個朋友的死。</p>
<p>常我在敵偽壞伺的游擊孤島上編輯一張汕印報紙時，我認識了一位同事。他姓黃，山東人，我們平時稱他「小黃」或「小侉子」。他的個兒很矮，有着一雙黑而大的眼睛，寫起文章來，老是用着那支隨身帶的舊派克鋼筆，一面寫稿，一面咬啃着指甲，他的每個指頭伸出來，都尖禿禿的，可是他選繼續啃着，好像他寫文章的靈感，就躱藏在指甲縫裏一樣。</p>
<p>報紙是三日刋，油印而鉛印化，報社裏只有五個工作同志，平時職務雖有分別，可是工作的時候，只要自己能做的都願意槍着做；特別是小黃，除助編新聞撰稿外，他還能收音，寫鋼板、，有的時候，還拿起一個汕墨棍來印刷。</p>
<p>報紙印出後，除掉分發給孤島上的讀者外，並用種種方法傳遞到敵僞區域。有一天，我們的報紙竟在敵人據點的牆壁上出現了，於是整個據點內的敵僞軍都驚惶不安。當這個消息傳進我們耳裏時，像得了至高的報酬一樣，馬上小黃就編了一個歌，我還記得裏面有謗麼幾句：「不用手槍炸彈，只有鐵筆鋼板，不用「湯姆生」「三八式」，只用油印機米達尺，展開文化的突擊戰，進攻敵人的心和瞻！」</p>
<p>幾個人　執了一件武器——鐵筆，米　　，油墨棍，……小黃拿的是他　不開身的派古筆。一面　　　器，一而唱着，到後來　　　　沾染每個人的手上，鼻上，類上，互相對看而狂笑·</p>
<p>可是我們的報紙，只發行了七十號，就遇到敵人的打擊，——敵人下鄕掃蕩。我們的圩子被圍了三天，因爲糧彈發生問題，我們不得不在一個月黑之夜，隨着守軍突圍了。</p>
<p>在熾烈的火網中，我們五個工作同志衝出了三個，一個是在中途被擊斃的；一個是失了蹤，失蹤的不是別人，正是小黃。</p>
<p>敵人的掃蕩，像　在桌面上的火酒，熾烈地燃燒了一陣，很快地熄滅了。我們仍舊回到了原來的地點，圩子已經破壞，圩裏房屋燒去了一大半，報社用的一間草房，運一根太頭都沒有剩。但我們無暇憑弔，因爲＼當時頂緊要的事是找尋小黃。我們分頭導找，找到了許多被敵人殘害的屍體，可是裏而沒有小黃；最後在一個半一棚一裏的草堆旁邊，尋到了他仰躺着的屍身。他的面貌充分地表現着憎恨，身上沒有傷，只是喉管已經腐爛，有着一個深深的洞穴，但看出不是刀傷，一隻沒有指甲的右手，揑緊着一支他慣用的派克筆，筆管沒有了，筆尖的頭兒已成耙形，血漬染紅了他的筆尖和筆桿，他的手和身。</p>
<p>這不是很明顯的嗎？他因爲沒有衝出火網，他就躱藏在半車棚裏，後來敵人衝進來了，他爲了不願做俘虜，所以就利用他偉大的武器——派克鋼筆尖，戳斷了自己的喉管而壯烈犧牲了。</p>
<p>我們的推測是一點不錯的，這支鋼筆，是他戰鬥的伴侶，他用他的筆，訴說了人民的苦難；他用他的筆暴露了敵人的暴行；他更用他的筆執行文化的突擊；最後他還用他的筆蘸了自己喉管專放射出來的血，完成了偉大的詩篇。……</p>
<p>小黃理入土，這支筆也殉葬了。——也祗有他，纔配用這支筆啊！</p>
<p>從此以後我只要見到鋼筆上的挺硬的筆尖，就會想到小黃的死，同時也彷彿見到筆尖上有着凝結的血漬在閃耀。</p>
<h3>美·現代劇作家　奧尼爾</h3>
<p>— 蔡雪</p>
<p>奧尼爾Engene　O－Neill沈寂了十二年，又有新著問世。「冰人來了」（The　Iceman　Cometh）在戰前已開始動筆，不久將公開演出。這是一齣四幕劇，包含十九個人物，至少須演四小時，僅較他從前兩種最著名的劇本，少半小時。長短在他看來是不成問題的。「祗要短得不至於無味，長得不使人討厭」，他這樣回答人說。除了「冰人來了」以外，他又寫了兩種新劇本，尙未發表。</p>
<p>他從一九三一年，携眷至西岸，一住便十餘年，直到最近，才回紐約。這次回來，他把家具全賣掉了，帶來的只是些書籍和古玩之類。</p>
<p>他的身村是瘦而且長的，穿得非常講究，髮光可鑑，舉動之間，似乎有點羞澀，一雙眼睛，卻烱烱有光。談吐中時露于變鬱之容，間亦雜以詼諧。</p>
<p>他父親是著名的約翰·奧尼爾。他曾跟他父親東奔西走。他常記得他父親的一句話：「現在的戲劇界，太奄奄無生氣了。不錯，在他父親的時候，劇中人物，不是好，便是壞，界限分明。「現在審査劇本」，他說：「還是承襲着這種舊觀念，很可妨碍藝術上的進步。他們所關心的只是會不會把六七歲的小孩子敎壞了，那裏知道在六七歲的小孩子中間，也很有幾位能敎壞我們的呢？有一次，我的劇本給那班審査委員抓住了，不料票予的銷路，反而大增。不過來看的，仍是些不相干的人，大多失望而去，因爲這劇本並不如他所想像的那麽一壞。」</p>
<p>他又痛恨那戲院子中的老闆們，不肯嘗試比較新奇一點的東西，祗會搬演那十年前曾鎌賺過錢的劇本，不敢冒險。他以爲祗有肯寫新劇本的人，才會　究到新藝術。新藝術成爲一時風尙之後，盛極必衰，印象派便是其中一例。「風尙」之所以使人討厭，在於不懂藝術的人，也來冒充藝術家。此不獨戲爲然，他種藝術，也是如此。戲劇也與岡畫音樂一般，有一定的規例。祗有眞正能懂得這些規例的人，才能打破他們。</p>
<p>他以爲電影對於戲劇，有損而無益。好萊塢把會做戲的人都搶去了。編劇的人，要想好萊塢來買他的劇本，不免過於遷就他們的脾胃。他說他並不反對電影，而且很喜歡看電影。但寫劇本的時候，決不可存心爲他日改編電影留下地步。寫劇本與寫電影是兩種不同的藝術。改劇太爲電影，乃電影家的事，不是戲劇家的事。</p>
<p>無綫電也有他的範圍，大可不必與戲劇混爲一談。</p>
<p>奧尼爾生於紐約，現年五十八歲。七歲入學，在潑林司登大學肄業的時候，因品行不端被斥，流浪於南菲北美一帶，所做的事，一無成就。最後仍回紐約，跟他父親演劇，因身體不好，又到醫院巾去療義，寂靜無聊，才開始寫作劇本，就此成名。</p>
<p>他說他最怕看他自己所編的劇本。扮演者往往不能把他心中所想的表演出來，甚至於南轅北轍。祗有却爾司。葛爾彬扮演「約翰王」的門丁，能合他的意。</p>
<p>大戰發生以後，因外面紛擾得太利害了，不能安心寫作。他不會用打字機，又不喜歡口授，所以稿本全是親筆寫成的。</p>

<h3>一寸山河一寸血　96</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>〔不是把那火藥庫炸了吧？」虎弟這們猜着。</p>
<p>「火藥庫？」我回想汽汕區的情形，「那不能吧。油桶汕池隔開火藥庫有六七丈遠哪。」我儘量想着這件事的司能性。</p>
<p>「要不，就是鬼子使炸彈把火炸熄？」虎弟應用他的最高知識和聰明，作第二種猜測。</p>
<p>「更不對……」我解釋着，「使炸彈把火炸熄，也是可能的辦法，可是從那聲　上聽去，這個炸彈最少有一兩千磅，也　還不止。細才炸的時候，連這裏幾里地以外，都震得有些跳動哩。……怕他們這裏不見得有這大的炸彈吧。」……（記者追述　羣的報吿，到此爲止）。</p>
<p>羣說到這裏，我（記者）接口補充，吿訴在座的人，「這件事永遠也難叫瞭了。不過我倒有一個猜想，我十認爲是鬼子在那地下預先埋下的地雷爆炸了。我知道他們有些重要地區，常常預先埋下地雷，一旦吃了敗仗，來不及把重要物資運走，就用電力發動地雷，把東西燬掉。籍國人也有這個毛病。只不曉得這一次的爆炸，是汽油燃燒火力太大，把地雷引動？還是他們自己用電機發動的爆炸。這只好讓牠永遠秘密下去了。」</p>
<p>我又問　羣和小老虎怎樣回來的。耀羣說，他們走到翠姐相　的地段，已經十一點過了。找到自已藏着的汽車。大的爲了雙龍暫這件公案，公路上鬼子的哨車太多，來往搜尋，所以不敢上路。伏在田裏，等了半個多小時，才駕了車子回來。</p>
<p>我們一邊聽耀羣說着這個故事，一邊不斷收到前綫戰事報吿。各方我軍陣地，情形都壞；通縣這裏，只有一千多名「保安隊」，和二三營烏合之衆的僞軍，哪裏能够支持下去？同時，我們又收到北平行動總部呌這裏緊急撤退的命令，所以這裘的臨時司令，立即命令各位同志，準備撤退及善後工作。</p>
<p>我把鶴見呌我把秘書機關。遷到山西，又呌我趕到東京去的話，也吿訴了耀羣和虎城。他們二人聽了，虎城那又大又圓的眼睛，立刻放出了閃爍奇光，大有躍躍欲試的樣子，耀羣却低下了頭，大有不勝低徊惆悵的神情。</p>
<p>我們一行，臨出城時，城南已經火光燭天，日寇大的已經反攻進來，眼看這數千健兒浴血奪回的山河，又將再度滿入　手。沿路街上，沉沉如死；昏暗不明的燈光下，靑天白日的旗幟，仍舊縣宕在家家屋　底下，也許這十數萬的純良人民，還在夢裏慶祝着祖國的重光哩！（第五章完）</p>

<h3>美鈔</h3>
<p>— 少夫</p>
<p>每一次政治上有點變動，上海的金融市塲何非常敏感地掀風作浪起來，此次美鈔的狂跳，却不是由於這方面的造謠，而由於外匯將放長的無稽傳說。投機家利用市塲心理穿鑿附會的本領，憑心說是非常聰明而有聲有色的。</p>
<p>從表面上看去，我們沒有美鈔在手，又不使用美鈔的人，對於它的漲落，似乎沒有好大關係；然而實際上它與其它物價息息相關，（比如此次美鈔漲，金價也隨之而漲，）我們沒有花旗票，反倒澈頭澈尾地蒙受其損害。</p>
<p>天空舖着層層灰色的雲，在北風中聽到一些商店所雇的兩人樂隊吹奏，那種單調的音曲，令人感到十分凄切，這是一種象徴。工商業目前正處於最困難的關頭，實在也再受不了風吹草動的刺激了。</p>
<p>談起美鈔，據說：美國平均每天要印三千五百萬美元的鈔票，最小的票面額是一元，最大的票面額是十萬元。鈔票印刷公司的地點在華盛頓，工作人員共有七千人。鈔票紙的原料，百分之五十是布，百分之五十是棉花。關於這一點，不知做美鈔生意的朋友知道了？</p>
<h3>營養專家</h3>
<p>— 索貝</p>
<p>人物素描</p>
<p>「營養專家」自稱「先天不足，後天失調」，因而面黃肌瘦，心身交瘁。最近又因憂國傷時，夜夜失眠。在這樣的情形下，他覺得健康情况太惡劣了；因此，他遇人傳說：「我的身體要崩潰了！」</p>
<p>正如「重慶二十四小時」（抗戰名劇）中那位醫生所說的：「身體太壞，營養太差！」這位「營養專家」，逢人便學　　　兩句台詞。</p>
<p>「營專」先生（我們這樣稱呼他）的原來姓名，曉得的人很少，遠在勝利以前，我們就不約而同地給他起了一個「營養專家」的「芳號」。他實在太懂得營養了，一天到晚抱着「維他命與營養」一類的書，甚至吃一顆花生米，都要大作文章，說是花生衣是富有營養價值的，不可棄掉；但是，人家吃花生米平安無事，他一吃了花生米，却馬上胃痛呀，腸鳴呀，百病俱來。</p>
<p>他有兩隻溫度計，一是測氣候的，一是量體溫，看看氣候溫度計，他主張開窗與否以及蓋多少被，必須先看室內的溫度計而後決定；早上起來，穿多少衣裳，也就如此決定的。偶然他　覺失常了，他必大灌開水，靜坐休息，但是靜坐沉思，却更增加他的心靈不安。因此，他總覺得身體的不舒適越來越形嚴重；馬上再照照鏡子，數數脈膊，忽然覺得大病將臨，他覺得必須照X光，騐驗血，於是立即跑到醫生那兒去了。醫生知道他是個「機械衛生家」，只好輕描淡寫地給他一些消化藥，呌他多多運動，但是他却說：「像我這樣衰弱，只能散步，不宜劇烈運動！」醫生無可奈何只一笑。</p>
<p>他問到家裏，覺得這位醫生太不盡責了。他再照照鏡子，忽然覺得面色已有進步，靑白裏略帶紅光，但是他接着再一想！不對，這恐怕是在發熱。你瞧時鐘上不正是下午一時嗎？恐怕已是TB的初期了，已在發“Noon-Fever”了。他感到無限悲傷，好像世界上什麼東西都不是他的。他自言自語：「應該打點鈣針，應該多吃點頂好的魚肝油丸。於是，他從衣袋裏拿出了一粒“Haivita”接着再對着窗口呼吸着新鮮空氣，休息了幾分鐘，他忽然覺得精神好了些，再咳一口痰，仔細一看，痰中尚未發現血絲，他的神經漸漸安定下來。</p>
<p>入晚，他設計着：怎樣的晚餐，才是世上最最完善的「維他命」餐？他關照娘姨：「每一碗菜裏必須放些番茄，奶油，猪肝……而且不能太熟，否則，維他命燒死了！不過，蔬菜裏的細菌，必須殺光！」這可把未受「營養衛生教育」的娘姨，弄得莫名其土地堂了。晚飯開出後，他並不想吃，大槪是那顆魚肝油丸“Halivita”太濃了，消化不了；這使他更其恐慌。他翻了翻「攝生之道」那本書，據說維他命B與C有幫助消化之功，因此他又決定注射維他命B與C。</p>
<p>天天講營養，時刻重健康，而結果竟是「營」生無道，「養」病無方，「營專」先生對着鏡子發愁，醫生也笑着搖搖頭。</p>
<p>幼稚與過敏，毀滅了營養專家的健康！</p>
<h3>騙子花樣多</h3>
<p>— 秀菊</p>
<p>現在上海的騙局神出不窮，眞是越來越多，要是略不小心便會上了大大的當。日前是家兄結婚佳期，假座康樂酒樓，嘉賓滿座，融融一堂熟閙萬分。昨日即把所有來賓的賀儀計有現款，禮券本票等等，一併解往上海××銀行，但其中有兩張××錢莊伍萬元，具名×××的本票，退了回來大家便非常詫異，急忙翻閱禮簿見內有黃××先生送本票拾萬元正，家父頓起懷疑謂與黃××先生素無往來，並不相識，所以即明瞭此人定於康樂酒樓行結婚禮時，待主婚人新郎與新娘入禮堂之時所　送的。因爲那時所有主人與管事人俱圍在大禮堂樂臺的四周看結婚儀式留在賬桌上的是幾個管事人之類，因爲此人冒黃××先生的名，所以管事者以爲家父與黃先生素有往來便不加思索的發了一萬元的台力。誰知此票乃是僞組織時過期本票，此人每天候所有假座於較大禮堂結婚的便送幾拾萬元僞本票去作爲賀儀，一天之中也有好多萬的台力可收，比了厚了而皮去向人借或討要省力多多呢！但被騙者大受其麻煩了。所以以後辦喜事的先生們尤其是坐於賬桌上的管事人請多特別注意，切勿再讓這些欺騙者自鳴得意</p>
<h3>早睡不可得</h3>
<p>— 建華</p>
<p>上海市各界節約運動委員會，前天在舉行常務會議的時候，吳市長建議大家早睡早起，以節省用電。早睡早起的好處，早經教育家衛生家詳細說明，婦孺皆知這裏不需要冗長的描寫。</p>
<p>不過，都市的夜，是不允許市民早睡的。報館裏的工作人員，當然不得早睡；學校裏的教師，爲了批改課卷，準備教材，恐也難得早睡；即從政的要人們，因爲不可少的宴會酬酢，或協商大事，也只得犧牲早睡時間來周旋一個深晚的。</p>
<p>講到工商各界，他們辛苦了一整天，誰都願意早睡，可是隔壁的麻將聲，吵閙聲，無綫電播音聲，吉普卡喇叭聲等等，反比教育家衛生家提倡早睡的呼聲還要有力，終使你要睡不能睡，結果大家養成晚睡的習慣。至於一般貧苦階級，失業大眾，他們在打算明天的柴米油鹽，勞心焦思，更是睡不着。現在能享早睡幸福的人，在這個年頭越來越少了。</p>
<p>我們同情吳市長的建議，我們並懂得早睡早起對於身體健康的意議，但是如何能得安安逸逸的早睡，簡直成爲無法解決的都市社會問題。我想天下決無「有福不會享，坐了等天亮。」的傻子。</p>
<p>心理分析家的故事</p>
<h3>無辜的殺人犯　6</h3>
<p>— 許桂庭</p>
<p>「她告訴我們來找你的，」巡警長說。</p>
<p>「魯遜本人在那裏呀？」</p>
<p>「我們還未把他找着，他逃走了。」</p>
<p>「你能够幫我們忙嗎？」巡警長問：「我以爲他一定殺瘋了。」</p>
<p>「是的，他所患的是分裂性癲狂病。從來就沒有人能够預測這樣的神經病人所幹的事情。他也許不會記得他自己所幹的事情，他也不會辨別到他曾經做過錯事情。」</p>
<p>警長就帶了米恩，介紹他給海凌大夫。海凌說：「我已經設法把她的神經麻醉了，所以她現在不會覺得怎樣痛。如果你要和她談談，現在正是時候了。」</p>
<p>米恩以爲魯遜夫人睡在床上，一定很美麗，嬌小而且勇敢。不料恰恰相反，她變成非常醜怪，縮起來簡直像一個矮冬瓜。一雙黑漆漆的眼睛溜來溜去，一直等到米恩進來才停止。</p>
<p>米恩說：「喂，魯遜夫人！他們對你做了些什麼呀？」</p>
<p>魯遜夫人靜默了半響，才低聲地說：「米恩大夫，阿當將來怎麼辦呢？我想我終要死了。那麼，怎樣才好？他總是難逃法網的呀。」</p>
<p>「他一定沒有問題，我會照顧他的。」</p>
<p>她的臉龐漸漸鬆懈起來，聲音也較前更爲淸楚，說，「這樣好極了。你一定要對他們解釋，否則他們不會明瞭的。你一定要對他們聲明，你能够治好他。我的確是一個傻子，沒有好好地看守他。我不知道他居然會藏了一枝手槍呢。」</p>
<p>「米恩大夫，我們不知道怎樣能够弄到一些錢。我們從來就是沒有錢的。對你大約沒有問題罷。」</p>
<p>「沒有問題，我會照顧亞當的。你好好地去睡罷。」</p>
<p>米恩是和海凌大夫走出室外。走到門口的時候，低聲地對海凌說：「你照顧她罷，一點綫索都發現不到。」</p>
<p>海凌拍拍米恩的手臂說：「再會。」</p>
<p>當米恩回到家裏的時候，他見到診室裏還亮着。魯遜和他的妻子，柏莉在火爐旁邊正在對面坐着。他們同時站起來。柏莉微笑對她的丈夫說：「喂，我的愛！我們等你等得好久啊！」</p>
<p>米恩立刻插嘴說：「喂，魯遜！」</p>
<p>魯遜微微一笑，但沒有講什麼。他穿了一件黑色的晚服，看起來個子很大，非常漂亮。柏莉說：「魯遜先生來這裏送還一條棍給你呢。」</p>
<p>「噢，你終於還給我了，你這個小偷，」米恩說。</p>
<p>「對的，那條棍已經擺在客廳裏。」魯遜很不介意地說，「眞對不起，我麻煩米恩夫人了，但是她是最和靄的最諒解的人呢。我以爲米恩夫人現在一定明白我的苦衷了罷。」</p>
<p>米恩夫人微笑着說：「當然，我明白你的苦衷了。」</p>
<p>魯遜於是很自負地繼續說：「我特地來這裏，把這個厭煩的故事講給米恩夫人聽，因爲也許你未回來之前，我已經走了。你當然知道的，我殺害過女人。雖然另外一些人對我會想及其他的東西，可是我想你應該知道的，因爲我時常想知道的……」</p>
<p>「當然」，米恩插口說，「我想知道關於你的一切事情。唔，你仍然拿着那枝手槍嗎？」</p>
<p>「是的，」魯遜答，同時把手放到大衣的右手袋裏去</p>
<p>「那麼，請你把它交給我，好嗎？」</p>
<p>「這是不大重要的罷。」魯遜這樣回答。</p>
<p>米恩沒有辦法，縮一縮肩頭，冷淡地說：「好罷，柏莉，你旣然已經聽過那個故事，你最好還是去睡罷。現在已經不早了。講完之後，轉過頭來對魯遜說，「柏莉走開，讓我們來談，你大約不介意的罷。」（未完）</p>
<p>常識測驗</p>
<h3>鉛筆·樟腦丸·鋼精　到底是什麼東西</h3>
<p>— 丁一厂</p>
<p>不久以前，有些人不是爲了「內戰」與「內亂」這兩個詞兒的　我而爭辯過一番麼？對於「正名」，是重要的事，不過我們日常身邊，有好多名詞也常慣地用錯而毫不覺察了。比方說：「賽璐珞」呌做「化學」一種新式人造織維呌做「玻璃」，而另一種透明的「可塑體」製品如梳子之類，也呌做「玻璃」，……名字錯得太可怕了。</p>
<p>下面十條問題都是這一類命題。即使習慣上一時我們嘴上扭不過來，最低限度，心里却應該明白底蘊的。</p>
<p>我想：有中學程度自然科學常識的人，應該毫不費力在十分鐘內答中七題以上。明天本欄將刊出答案。</p>
<p>1我們手裏常常用「鉛筆」寫字，你以爲這鉛筆中間那條黑色的「鉛芯」是用什麼製造出來的呢？</p>
<p>A眞的是金屬的鉛，略如印刷用鉛字的鉛麼？　　B鉛的氣化物麼？</p>
<p>C抑或，是金屬的石墨，即如乾電池裏面那種黑色的東西呢？</p>
<p>2秋末冬來，我們該把夏天的衣服藏起來了。好吧，在衣箱裏放幾顆「洋樟腦丸」（或稱「臭丸」）驅逐蛀蟲吧。這「洋樟腦丸」色白，有辛辣的氣味。你以爲它是製造自：</p>
<p>A樟腦油的精鍊麼？</p>
<p>B煤焦油裏面提出「萘」（Naphtnalene）麼？</p>
<p>C抑或，薄荷　洋的禇領或渣滓呢？</p>
<p>3貴婦們手上眩目金鋼鑽，從成分上說，你以爲這種價值億萬的鑽實，是：</p>
<p>A和炭爐子喪而燒的木炭幾乎完全相同呢？</p>
<p>B和貓眼石相同呢？</p>
<p>C抑或，和夜光手錶上頭那在夜裏發亮的字體所含有某種成分相同呢？</p>
<p>4高級的金屬洋餐具，汽車零件，電燈裝飾，眼鏡邊緣，或者女人身上某些雪亮如銀的裝飾品……之類，好些人說那都是鍍「克羅咪」的，究「克羅咪」是一種什麼金屬呢？它是：</p>
<p>A洋銀或鎳麼？</p>
<p>B銀的合金麼？</p>
<p>C還是　呢？</p>
<p>5買包　來香烟抽抽，紙盒裏頭總有一張銀白色的金屬薄「紙」包裹着香煙捲，好些人呌它做「　精紙」，但你以爲它是：</p>
<p>A鋁箔呢？</p>
<p>B錫箔呢？</p>
<p>C抑或，眞的是　　的薄片呢？</p>
<p>6那末，順便再問一聲：印刷在紙烟包圖案上那呈現出一種金色的「金粉」，它本來是什麼東西呢？它是：</p>
<p>A靑鋼粉呢？</p>
<p>B紫鋼粉呢？</p>
<p>C還是含着萬分之一的低金金屬粉呢？</p>
<p>7對的有些香烟包圖案印刷的不用金色「金粉」，而用銀色的「銀粉」，那末，你又以爲這「銀粉」的本來是：</p>
<p>A鋁粉麼？</p>
<p>B銀與鎳的合金粉末麼？</p>
<p>C「銀硃」這名字對我們不會生疏的。它是紅色的顏料，有時又有人叫它做「辰砂」而用作藥材。它的成分，你以爲是：</p>
<p>A大部份含有銀的化合物麼？</p>
<p>B含有小部份砂土的化合物麼？</p>
<p>C抑或是，汞（即水銀）的硫化物呢？</p>
<p>9近代家庭廚房裏少不了有一套顏色銀白可愛，拿起來又輕便得很的所謂「鋼精鍋」，你以爲這種金屬的本該呌做：</p>
<p>A「銻」呢</p>
<p>B「鋁」呢</p>
<p>C抑或「特殊鋼」呢？</p>
<p>10大都市的商店裏，大多數裝有新式棒樣發光管，上海人普通呌它做「日光管」，你以爲更適當的稱呼，應該叫它做：</p>
<p>A「螢光管」或「冷光管」呢？</p>
<p>B「太陽燈」呢？</p>

<h3>Supporting Domestic Production Industries: Implementing a Strict Import Permit System - Executive Yuan Announces 18 Articles of Measures</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 17th] The provisional measures for import and export trade and appendices, promulgated by the Executive Yuan in March of this year, have now been revised by the Executive Yuan and submitted to the National Government on the 17th for approval as instructed.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper's Dispatch] In order to adjust foreign trade policy and complete the domestic economic construction, the government specially announced the revised provisional measures for import and export trade, consisting of 18 articles, on the 17th, to be implemented immediately. According to these revised measures, the export of all goods, except for nine major categories of prohibited exports, is permitted freely. The import of all goods, except for forty major categories of prohibited imports, shall require an import permit before being allowed entry. In other words, the government will henceforth implement a comprehensive import permit system for foreign trade. At the same time, in order to implement this system and coordinate the work of relevant institutions, a Provisional Import Control Committee will be established under the Supreme Economic Council, with an Executive Committee set up within it to implement the formulated policies. (The revised provisional measures for import and export trade and appendices will be detailed in this newspaper's seventh edition.)</p>
<p>Premier of the Executive Yuan, Song, specially addressed this matter at 4:00 PM on the 17th at the Executive Yuan, hosting a press conference to deliver the following remarks:</p>
<p>Since the end of the war last autumn, the most urgent task for our country's reconstruction is to obtain materials to replenish the shortages of the past eight years. A large quantity of imported goods has already arrived to meet this need, in addition to materials transported by the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) and surplus materials from Pacific islands agreed upon with the United States for transfer. Therefore, the government is confident in ensuring an adequate supply of materials, and the issue of material supply can be considered resolved satisfactorily.</p>
<p>This situation enables the government to focus all its efforts on construction. Now that the time is ripe, the government should immediately implement a method of selectively permitting imports under its general economic policies, expanding the application of the import permit system from the provisional measures for import and export trade promulgated on March 1st of this year to all imported goods.</p>
<p>All imported goods will be classified according to their nature. Essential goods and raw materials needed by domestic production industries, as well as other materials with legitimate uses, will be given priority for import. Furthermore, the transport of various equipment will be facilitated. However, the import of non-essential goods will not be encouraged.</p>
<p>These revised provisional measures for import and export trade were submitted, approved, and promulgated for implementation today, and are sufficient to support domestic production industries and promote economic construction. Although a temporary measure, it is an extremely important step in our country's economic construction process.</p>

<h3>Government In Principle Agrees to the Four Opinions Put Forward by the Democratic Socialist Party</h3>
<p>Sun Baogang and Others Will Fly to Beiping Today to Visit Zhang Dongsun for Consultation</p>
<p>[This Newspaper's Nanjing Dispatch, 17th] The issue of the Democratic Socialist Party's participation in the National Assembly may soon be realized. After arriving in the capital on the 16th, Zhang Junmai, Xu Chuanlin, Sun Baogang, Jiang Yuntian, and others submitted four opinions to the government: (1) Resolve the Communist Party issue politically; (2) Party groups should withdraw from schools; (3) The constitutional draft submitted to the National Assembly should be based on the revised draft of the Political Consultative Conference (PCC), hoping to guarantee its passage; (4) Guarantee the people's four major freedoms.

It is expected that after one or two more rounds of consultation, a decision can be made, and the party's submission of each single is only a matter of time.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper's Nanjing Dispatch, 17th] Jiang Yuntian visited Lei Zhen at the Council of State Affairs at 11:30 AM on the 17th and talked for a while. Lei then visited Zhang Junmai.

<p>[This Newspaper's Nanjing Dispatch, 17th] Zhang Junmai talked on the morning of the 17th: "As long as the government implements democracy, we can help at any time."

<h3>Democratic League Attitude Active</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper's Nanjing Dispatch, 17th] The attitude of the Democratic League has become more active again due to the arrival of Zhang Junmai and others in the capital. Luo Longji visited Zhang Junmai at 10:30 AM on the 17th. It is said that apart from a portion of the Democratic League insisting on following the Communist Party, the rest believe that they should decide on their own independent position at present.</p>
<p>[French News Agency, Nanjing, 17th] Democratic League spokesman Luo Longji said on the 17th that the Democratic League will refuse to accept the seats left to them by the reorganized National Government Committee, as the Democratic League feels that this step will not help with the unification and peace of the country, just as the Democratic League's participation in the National Assembly will not help with unification. Mediation activities have been suspended due to the convening of the National Assembly, but I have formally notified the government that I will stay in the capital or near Shanghai so that I can make efforts to mediate again when the opportunity arises. As for the negotiations between the government and the Democratic Socialist Party to request the party to participate in the National Assembly, the details are still unknown. If the party breaks away from the Democratic League and participates in the National Assembly, it will not have a significant impact on the strength of the Democratic League, as the Democratic League only has 20 Democratic Socialist Party members. However, if it is consistent with the Democratic League, it will in principle obtain 40 seats in the National Assembly, which is the number of seats that the government requires it to split with the Democratic League to give it.</p>

<h3>Striving for Construction After Destruction - Chahar in New Life - Restoring Electricity is the Current Urgent Task</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper's Beiping Dispatch, 17th] A reporter went to Chahar for the second time and returned from Zhangjiakou on the 16th. Seeing Chahar Province striving for construction from destruction, (1) The Zhangjiakou Railway Bureau has repaired eight broken locomotives and six train cars in one month. The affiliated machinery factory has been restored, and the monthly repair of three locomotives and thirty passenger and freight cars. More than 500 of the more than 700 workers have returned to the factory to work. Under the leadership of the old locomotive section chief, who is 70 years old, the work enthusiasm is very good. (2) Administrative Department: The administrative meeting of the 12th War Area has gradually transferred government affairs, and the provincial government, which is gradually taking shape, and the provincial cadre training class will start on the 20th. The county magistrates appointed by former Chairman Feng, except for Huailai and Zhuoxian, have mostly not taken office. It is said that the commander has appointed others to take charge. The repatriation teams have all been disbanded, and retaliation is strictly prohibited. In addition to handling the land issue in accordance with the measures announced by the central government, further measures to adapt to the local conditions have not yet been formulated, but the principle has been decided. Except for those higher than the "two-five" rent reduction, which are reduced to the "two-five" standard, those that have been set lower than the "two-five" standard according to custom are not allowed to increase. Before the spring ploughing next year, it must be completely decided to replace the Zhen with work, and the 9,000 workers who are engaged in cleaning up the ruined factories and repairing the roads are given 3,000 to 4,000 legal tender per person per day. (3) Economic Department: The main power source of Chahar Province, the Xiahuayuan Power Plant, originally had 64,000 kilowatts of power generation equipment. The remaining machines can be pieced together to form a power generation machine of 10,000 kilowatts. The Resources Committee has checked it out. It can be repaired in two months. Zhangjiakou is currently repairing a generator that can supply 1,000 candles and an electric mill. Merchants and civilians cannot use it yet. After the automatic telephone was destroyed, there are currently more than 200 manual machines for military and government use, which can soon be increased to nearly a thousand, and a portion will be distributed to merchants and civilians. The cigarette factory, which originally produced hundreds of boxes a day, can use most of the machines, but it cannot start work due to lack of electricity. The same is true for other factories, so restoring electricity is the current urgent task. General commerce has become more prosperous due to the gradual increase in population, but the silver roots are still tight. There are about 3 billion legal tender circulating in the market, so prices have not risen much, increasing by one-tenth or two-tenths compared to when it was recovered. There is only one silver bank (there were more than 20 when the Chinese Communist Party was in power, all of which had Chinese Communist Party shares). The Central Bank has not yet opened. The main source of coal is the privately-owned Shixing Coal Mine in Xiahuayuan (the Chinese Communist Party once invested a quarter of the shares), which currently produces 200 tons of coal per day (it originally produced 1,000 tons of coal). In addition, there is the Pangjia Small Mine, which produces 30 to 40 tons per day. If industrial electricity has not been restored, it can still cope. (4) Cultural and Educational Department: There are more than 30 schools that have opened in the province. One middle school and one normal school can be restored recently. There is no hope for the restoration of schools above the vocational level. Middle and elementary school textbooks have been transported from Beiping. The operators are China and Commerce. In addition, a cultural relics preservation committee has been formed, and a folk education hall and library will be established. The middle school advanced class that moved from Nankou to Zhangjiakou will be expanded to accommodate 500 people.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 17th] The disaster situation is serious throughout Chahar Province. Bai Shijin, director of the Civil Affairs Department of the Provincial Government, came to Beiping from Zhangjiakou on the 16th and is scheduled to fly to the capital on the morning of the 17th to ask the central government for instructions on handling emergency relief and requesting exemption from next year's field tax.</p>
<h3>Completion of the Sino-American Agricultural Mission; Full Report to be Published; American Team Members Leave Shanghai for Home</h3>
<p>[Nanjing, Central News Agency, 16th] The Sino-American Agricultural Technology Cooperation Team has now completed its mission. After paying respects to Chairman Chiang and visiting relevant ministries and commissions, the American team members have departed for Shanghai and are returning to the United States. The American team members arrived in Shanghai on June 27th, joined their Chinese counterparts, and immediately began work. They spent four weeks in Nanjing and Shanghai, after which they divided into smaller groups to inspect the actual conditions of major agricultural areas. The trip lasted a total of eleven weeks, covering fifteen provinces. They completed their field work on the 6th of last month and returned to Nanjing to begin drafting a report. The report, which is over forty pages long, was jointly discussed and prepared by the Chinese and American members of the team over a period of six weeks. It has been submitted to the governments of China and the United States for reference and to our government for adoption. It will be jointly published by the two governments at a later date.</p>
<p>American Team Leader's Remarks</p>
<p>The American team leader, Mr. Hutchison, stated that a sound agricultural plan is of utmost importance to China's prosperity. Whatever directly affects agriculture and the 300 million farmers indirectly affects the happiness of the entire nation. Agriculture is not only essential for the people's food, clothing, housing, and transportation, but also an important raw material for industry and a major source of foreign exchange. Before the war, the value of China's agricultural exports accounted for 70% of the total export value, which is clear evidence. This foreign exchange can be used by the Chinese government to purchase industrial machinery, transportation equipment, and special materials necessary for industrial development. If China can apply the latest scientific methods to improve soil, crops, livestock, and agricultural implements, it will certainly increase agricultural production and farmers' welfare. He also firmly believes that improving the tenancy system, agricultural loans, and the marketing of agricultural products in China can also improve the economic situation of farmers. Mr. Hutchison said: "Our country has made a good foundation in the improvement of plant seeds in the past ten years, but there is no foundation in the animal aspect. The food of the Chinese people should not only be sufficient in quantity but also emphasize quality. Vegetables, fruits, and meat are just as important as rice and wheat." Mr. Hutchison hopes that China can establish two or three well-equipped agricultural research institutes. China lacks agricultural technicians. Relying solely on hiring foreign experts and sending domestic agricultural students to study abroad is not the only solution. Because graduate students in agricultural science from Chinese universities are still doing research when they go abroad, but if there is a complete agricultural research institute in China, and they understand the domestic situation and are familiar with the environment, what they gain will definitely be greater than being in a different environment and unsuitable for the national conditions of their own country.</p>
<p>Key Recommendations</p>
<p>The team, deeply aware of the difficult environment faced by Chinese farmers, has prepared a report with sound plans and reasonable organizations to solve these problems and has submitted it to the governments of China and the United States for adoption and implementation. The recommendations are summarized as follows: (1) For the linkage of national agricultural education, research, and extension, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry and the Ministry of Education should cooperate effectively. All experimental stations under the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry in the capital and the agricultural colleges, agricultural experiment stations, and agricultural extension bureaus in the nine central regions of the country should be closely linked. The provinces should expand their businesses at all levels of agricultural institutions and strengthen their work. (2) For the widespread supply of low-interest agricultural loans, the improvement of agricultural product marketing, the improvement of tenancy systems in some areas, the implementation of land surveying, registration, and valuation, the Land Law promulgated by the National Government this year should be strictly enforced. (3) Establish a national agricultural bank to coordinate national agricultural finance to meet agricultural needs. (4) Establish an agricultural control bureau in the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry to handle plant and animal quarantine, grading and inspection of superior products, and suppression of adulteration. (5) China's limited agricultural resources cannot supply the current pressure of increasing population. This difficulty will be difficult to solve even with future agricultural and industrial development. The government should seek countermeasures to solve the problem early. (6) Special attention should be paid to the construction of chemical fertilizer plants, the development of farmland water conservancy, the improvement of crop and livestock breeds, the prevention and control of diseases and insect pests, the cultivation and protection of forests, the increase in poultry and livestock production, agricultural intelligence reports, and price surveys. (7) For major export agricultural products that have stopped exporting due to the impact of exchange rates, rising domestic transportation costs, and increased interest rates, effective countermeasures should be taken quickly to encourage their export. The completion of the above recommendations cannot be achieved overnight, but the team believes that all talents should be fully utilized and strive to achieve them as soon as possible. To implement the above recommendations, agricultural construction funds must be greatly increased. The team believes that this increase is necessary to improve the welfare of the Chinese people and increase national financial revenue, and the government should not be stingy.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Justice to Build Model Prison in Suzhou</h3>
<p>Technician Zhou Zengzu Arrives in Suzhou for Inspection</p>
<p>[Suzhou, Central News Agency, 17th] Zhou Zengzu, a technician from the Ministry of Justice, was ordered to go to Shanghai and then to Jiading, Taicang, and Kunshan to inspect court prisons and design construction. The detention center of the Wu County District Court is crowded, and the houses are insufficient. It is planned to expand it and build a new prison at the original site of the Jiangsu Rehabilitation Institute inside Panmen to house young criminals and set it as a youth prison; and build a new prison at the original site of the Third Prison in Xiaoliuzhen Lane, specializing in allowing prisoners to cultivate the land, which can be produced and set as an agricultural prison; it can be implemented in the 36th year. In the future plan, after the construction of the new prison is completed, the warden will be a simplified position, with specific affairs, the pseudo-Jiangsu model prison.</p>
<h3>Active Construction of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway; Unimpeded Traffic Between Haiphong and Lao Cai</h3>
<p>[Kunming, This Newspaper, 17th] The Yunnan Branch of the Import and Export Trade Association previously telegraphed the Ministry of Communications to quickly repair the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway to facilitate the future. Currently, the railway between Haiphong and Lao Cai is unimpeded, while the traffic between Hekou and Lao Cai is still pending. It is reported that the steel rails required for the repair of the road are about 180 kilometers in total and can be transported into the country for paving the Jianbish railway in the short term. The Ministry of Communications has agreed to allocate 20 million yuan per month for subsidies. The gentry and people of Mengzi, Jijiu, Jianshui, and Shiping, through which it passes, have suggested to the government to change the paving to a one-foot-wide track to connect with Bisezhai on the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway. In this way, one-third of the Shifo Road has been completed, which will greatly benefit the economic construction of southern Yunnan.</p>
<h3>Ninety-Three Japanese War Criminals in Changchun to be Sent to the Shenyang Northeast Headquarters for Trial; Hoping that Compatriots who Suffered Will Come to Testify Quickly</h3>
<p>[Changchun, Central News Agency, 17th] The reporting work of Japanese occupation criminals in Changchun has come to an end due to the end of the repatriation of Japanese expatriates. Changchun was the political center of the former Puppet Manchukuo, and most of the major war criminals were in Changchun. However, because the war criminal investigation agency was established too late, in addition to some reported by the Soviet army when they were in Changchun, most of the remaining war criminals were mixed into the Japanese expatriates and repatriated. Although a war crime investigation committee was set up in the former Japanese expatriate management office, its work did not achieve significant results, and the number of reported persons was small. By September 24, when the war criminal investigation committee was ordered to be established, most of the Japanese expatriates had been repatriated. As of now, a total of 93 suspected Japanese war criminals have been reported in the city. Except for a very small number reported by the Chinese, the rest are arrested because their positions are suspected of being war criminals. Regarding their crimes, either no one reported them, or because their addresses are now occupied by the Communist army, the investigation is extremely difficult. It is reported that the war criminal investigation committee has been ordered by the Thai Ministry of National Defense to be sent to the military court of the Northeast Headquarters in Panyang for trial recently. It is deeply hoped that compatriots who have been harmed by them will come to testify quickly or submit evidence in writing to avoid letting them escape the law again due to insufficient evidence.</p>
<h3>Our Country Sends Judges to Japan to Assist in the Trial of War Criminals</h3>
<p>[Nanjing, Central News Agency, 17th] Fang Naichang, a military law officer sent by the Military Law Department of the Ministry of National Defense, will go to Japan to assist General MacArthur's headquarters in the trial of war criminals and will depart soon. It is reported that in addition to assisting in the trial work, this trip will also conduct a wide range of investigations on the evidence of domestic trials of war criminals. It is also reported that several military judges will be sent to Japan next spring.</p>
<h3>Our Navy Ship Hai Shen Sinks off Cheung Chau</h3>
<p>One Crew Member Missing, Rest Rescued</p>
<p>[Hong Kong, Central News Agency, 17th] Our Army's Third Supply District military transport ship Hai Shen sank off Cheung Chau on the morning of the 14th while carrying more than 60 tons of military supplies from Hong Kong to Zhanjiang. Of the 22 crew members, one is missing and the rest were rescued. In addition, the machine sailing boat Hai Xue of Kaohsiung City, Taiwan Province, broke down while sailing and drifted to the waters of Cheung Chau in Hong Kong's territorial waters. The eight crew members were assisted by Hong Kong police boats to return to Hong Kong.</p>

<h3>Baoyun Temple Murder Case; Local Court Opened Trial Yesterday; Two Prisoners Admit to Poisoning</h3>
<p>[Beiping, United Press, 17th] The case of the abbot and incense partners of the ancient capital's famous Baoyun Temple being burned to death was opened in the local court today. Two main culprits, Taoist priests from the temple, confessed to poisoning. Six others also confessed to participating in the murder, while the remaining twenty-seven said they were forced by the main culprits. The two main culprits claimed that they had obtained the consent of each other Taoist priest to murder the abbot. The president of the Beiping Taoist Association issued a statement saying that if the abbot and incense partners had violated the rules, they could be expelled. The main culprit had previously filed a lawsuit against the abbot and incense partners, but the result was a loss. This murder may have been a private act of revenge.</p>

<p>[Hankou, This Newspaper, 17th] The Hubei Province Transferred Military Officers Training Corps held an inauguration ceremony this morning. Chairman Chiang specially awarded a training speech to encourage them to participate in national construction.</p>
<h3>Editorial: Revision of Import and Export Trade Measures</h3>
<p>The proposal to revise customs tariffs has long been called for by the industrial and commercial sectors. The main points of the appeal, apart from the exemption of export taxes, can be roughly divided into three areas: (1) increasing the tax rates on some imported goods, (2) restricting or prohibiting unnecessary imported goods, and (3) encouraging and facilitating much-needed imported goods such as machinery and transportation.</p>
<p>The so-called revision of import and export trade measures was indeed announced yesterday. This revision has not yet involved the tax rate portion, and the first point mentioned above still requires continued efforts. However, in terms of the points already revised, their importance cannot be underestimated. It can be said to be an epoch-making reform in China's foreign trade and tariff history. A summary is provided below:</p>
<p>(1) General Control: Under past measures, some goods could be freely imported and foreign exchange could be freely applied for. As a result, foreign goods flooded the market, resulting in a large trade deficit and a significant threat to national industries. Furthermore, it wasted foreign exchange funds, making it difficult to maintain a balanced exchange rate. The new measures stipulate that the import permit system will be extended to all imported goods. The purpose is naturally to correct the above-mentioned shortcomings and provide considerable protection to domestic industries in a precarious situation. This measure will undoubtedly win widespread sympathy.</p>
<p>(2) Prohibition of Unnecessary Goods: According to Schedule (3) B of the Interim Measures for the Revision of Import and Export Trade, this schedule includes goods not listed in Schedules (1), (2), (3) A, and (4), and their import will be temporarily suspended until further notice. Schedule (4), which prohibits the import of goods, includes as many as 37 tariff categories. All consumer goods, toys, ornaments, cosmetics, valuables, luxury goods, and other similar items are clearly prohibited from being imported. This is a significant improvement over the past method of relying solely on prohibitive tariffs and using heavy taxes as barriers. This measure is also in complete agreement with the expectations of the general public.</p>
<p>(3) Implementation of Quota System: The quota system is implemented concurrently with the prohibition of imports. That is, the quantity of goods permitted for import will also be subject to considerable restrictions. If this measure can be properly implemented, on the one hand, it can alleviate the large trade deficit, and on the other hand, the actual domestic needs will not be greatly hindered. We believe that this is also a very reasonable approach. The fact that importers are limited to those who have already registered and been approved by the Interim Import Management Committee, and that the distribution quotas are negotiated by the importers themselves, will inevitably present some difficulties during implementation. However, this is a procedural issue, and these difficulties should not be difficult to overcome.</p>
<p>(4) Goods for Priority Import: Essential goods and raw materials required by domestic production enterprises, as well as other materials with legitimate uses, will be allowed to be imported with priority. Furthermore, the import of various machinery and equipment will be facilitated. These are all goals that everyone has longed for. However, strictly speaking, these are still principles, not concrete measures. The so-called essential, legitimate, and facilitated aspects should be taken into consideration everywhere when implementing these principles in the future, and they should not be distorted.</p>
<p>(5) Equal Treatment for Government and Private Sectors: Article 13 of the revised measures stipulates that the procedures for applying for import permits for goods imported by industrial and commercial institutions or companies operated or managed by the government are the same as those for private enterprises. Our opinion on this article is the same as the above. That is, in the future implementation, we must take this principle into consideration everywhere, and it must not be distorted. In particular, the application procedures for import permits for goods needed for public purposes or by government agencies themselves will be handled entirely by the Executive Yuan. Furthermore, the Interim Import Management Committee can also issue general permits, including not only relief and rehabilitation materials, US surplus materials, and lend-lease materials, but also goods purchased by the government using foreign loans. If these goods are not entirely for public purposes or needed by government agencies themselves, it is hoped that private enterprises will also be considered, so that they have equal opportunities for allocation.</p>
<p>According to the authorities, all imported goods must be licensed, and US dollars will no longer be available for use, so a black market will not occur. We certainly hold the same view. However, in addition to formally imported goods, there are also a large number of smuggled goods flooding the market. These goods are not declared to customs or settled for foreign exchange at all. After import restrictions are implemented, the supply becomes less and the prices become more expensive, which means that the profits from smuggling become higher. Therefore, if strict measures are not taken to completely eliminate the smuggling route, will the black market for US dollars eventually be eliminated? This still seems to be a question. It is hoped that customs and related agencies will jointly assume this responsibility.</p>

<h3>General Review of Exemption and Deferment of Military Service in Hangzhou: Many Applicants, Insufficient Reasons; Chairman of Jiaxing Military Service Symposium Asks for Relaxation of Physical Examination</h3>
<p>[Our Hangzhou Dispatch, 17th] The review of exemption and deferment of military service for able-bodied men in Hangzhou has been largely completed and submitted to the Municipal Government, which is scheduled to conduct a general review at the Municipal Government on the morning of the 18th. It is reported that there are many applicants for exemption and deferment of military service, but most of them have insufficient reasons, and it is feared that only two or three out of ten will be approved.</p>
<p>[Our Jiaxing Dispatch] Xia Jiping, Commander of the Northern Zhejiang Military Region, after inspecting military administration in the county on the 14th, invited the heads of various agencies and organizations to hold a military service symposium at the county government on the 15th. Commander Xia instructed on the following points: (1) Conscription should still be the main method of recruiting soldiers, supplemented by recruitment, except for volunteers. (2) Volunteers should be based on their native place, native village, and native guarantee as a principle. (3) Volunteers should be subjected to physical examination before being sent to the county. (4) Prevent forced conscription, fraud, and buying and selling of positions. If there is any malpractice, it should be reported as much as possible. (5) To change the people's fear of joining the army, more publicity should be given. After Commander Xia gave his instructions, Chairman Zhang of the County Council offered the following opinions: (1) If people from other provinces have canceled their household registration in other provinces, the military department should be asked to pay attention and correct them to their native place. (2) New recruits come from rural areas. Their usual nutrition is inevitably insufficient, so please relax the physical examination slightly. Then, the heads of various agencies offered their opinions, and Xia made a supplementary report before the meeting adjourned.</p>
<p>[Our Wuxi Dispatch] This county was ordered to implement temporary conscription. The county government has previously instructed various districts, townships, and towns to follow and collect recruits. However, various townships and towns have some difficulties in handling the matter because it is a new undertaking. In order to encourage able-bodied men to actively enlist, some have allocated living and resettlement expenses for the families of able-bodied men. There is nothing illegal in this, but the collection of these expenses should be made public, and the income and expenditure accounts should be submitted to the township and town mayors' conference for review after the event. There should be no embezzlement or private allocation in the name of conscription. Special orders are given to comply with this.</p>
<p>[Our Jiangyin Dispatch] It is reported that the deputy mayor of Fengheng Township in this county was bribed to release able-bodied men. It is reported that Zhu Yaozhong of the 5th Bao paid 30,000 yuan, Shen Chulang of the 9th Bao paid 30,000 yuan, Zhu Peisheng of the 3rd Bao paid 50,000 yuan, and Mao Sanbao of the 8th Bao paid 100,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Military Grain to Be Collected by Deadline: Director of Zhejiang Grain Department Goes to Beijing for Instructions; Jiangsu Province Dispatches Personnel to Reside in Various Counties to Supervise Collection in Kind</h3>
<p>[Our Hangzhou Dispatch] The central government yesterday telegraphed Zhejiang Province to collect the required military grain in full by the end of December. Chen Zhao, Director of the Grain Department, after receiving the telegram, decided to go to Beijing to meet with the Minister of Grain to report on the current grain administration situation in the province and to ask for instructions on business matters. Before leaving, he told reporters the following points: (1) The number of military grains to be collected is quite large. Except for a part to be supplied locally, the rest will be transported out. (2) Since the collection began in various places, it has been far from ideal. Currently, only Jinhua, Sheng County, and Changhua counties have collected more than 50%. (3) The supervisory committee members of various districts departed on the 1st. (4) Regarding the matter of allocating flour and grain with the Executive Yuan, the province has no grain available for allocation other than the military grain to be collected, so it must also ask the Grain Department for instructions.</p>
<p>[Our Jiaxing Dispatch] The County Grain Department, in view of the urgency of military grain, dispatched personnel to various districts and townships to supervise collection yesterday. The supervisors are Zhu Dianfei for Xinfeng and Wangjiangjing districts, Qian Chunpei for Fengqiao district, Zheng Yongkang for Xinqiao district, Shen Chunying for Wangdian district, and Chen Weiting for the urban district. The required amount for each district is also allocated in proportion to the original tax amount of each township and town. Xinfeng district is 6,500 dan, Fengqiao district is 4,700 dan, Xinqiao district is 4,800 dan, the urban district is 5,900 dan, Wangjiangjing district is 3,100 dan, and Wangdian district is 4,900 dan, totaling 30,000 dan, which must be collected before the end of November to provide military grain.</p>
<p>[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch] The Jiangsu Provincial Grain Department, in order to strengthen the efficiency of collection and sale and to supervise closely, has specially appointed supervisors to reside in various counties. The supervisors in each area are as follows: Suzhou, Liu Disheng; Wuxi, Wang Shaozeng; Wujiang, Su Kuibing; Wujin, Yu Yueqiu; Yixing, Tang Qixian; Songjiang, Yang Jiayou; Danyang, Tu Zhongqi; Changshu, Zhang Chenglun; Kunshan, Jiang Zengduan; Qingpu, Zhang Yan; Jiangyin, Chen Xuecai.</p>
<p>[Our Suzhou Dispatch] Although the actual collection of field tax in this county has been fully launched, few people have gone to the counter to pay. During the period of restoration and pacification, not only is the supply of military grain urgent, but also the central, provincial, and county finances have been exhausted. All depend on the income from field tax to supplement them. After investigation by local experienced experts, the reason is that the collection is not vigorous enough. The county government of this county issued another notice on the 15th to the district chiefs and deputy directors of the township offices of the Field Grain Office, instructing them to take into account the current difficulties, not to resign from complaints, and to go to various townships and towns immediately to supervise the township and baojia chiefs to step up the collection. At the same time, they should do their best to publicize, so that every household knows it, and strive to pay first, so that the number can be cleared before the deadline of December 15 to meet the needs.</p>
<p>[Our Wujin Dispatch] Regarding the actual collection of field tax in Muxian, the County Grain Department previously stipulated that the second and ninth districts should start collection first, and ordered the office to collect and deliver as it goes. It is now known that the ninth district has delivered 900 dan, which have been transported to the city one after another. Various households have complied with the order to pay, and the results are very good. All other districts, except for the sixth and seventh districts due to special circumstances, will start full collection on the 15th.</p>

<h3>Anhui Province Actively Repairing Highways: Old Trucks Carry Passengers, Extremely Crowded</h3>
<p>[Our Hefei Dispatch] The pre-war highways in Anhui Province were more than 5,000 kilometers long. After the Anti-Japanese War, they were almost completely destroyed due to military impact. Last year, after the victory, under the principle of "Transportation First," the original highways were rush-repaired. To date, the highways that have been repaired and opened to traffic include (1) Hefei-Lihuang Road, 242 kilometers long. (2) Hefei-Anqing Road, 185 kilometers long. (3) Hefei-Bengbu Road, 158 kilometers long. The section from Hefei to Shuijiahu borrows the original roadbed of the Huainan Coal Mine.

<h3>Rampant Banditry in Jiangxi Province: Robberies of Boats and Vehicles, Brutal Murders of Passengers; Joint Defense by Various Counties to Strengthen Security</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanchang] Jiangxi is currently experiencing a most serious phenomenon: the decline of all industries, widespread unemployment, and rampant robbery. There is a sense of a proliferation of bandits, making every step feel like walking through thorns. However, none of the robbery cases have been solved. This is because the perpetrators are destitute, temporarily band together to take risks, and scatter immediately after dividing the loot, each seeking their own livelihood. There are no fixed, long-term bandits, so it's impossible to track them down.</p>
<p>Continuous Robberies</p>
<p>The Gan River is the only major artery in Jiangxi and the central hub for shipping. While there have been occasional robberies of civilian boats, they usually occurred in areas difficult for the military and police to patrol. However, on the 10th of this month, at Sanjiadian, 35 miles from the provincial capital, two boats belonging to the Fulian Weiji Company, one upstream and one downstream, were simultaneously robbed. This was similar to the robbery of nine civilian boats a week earlier. Around 1:00 PM on the 10th, the "Fuyuan" ferry, en route from the provincial capital to Ji'an, reached Sanjiadian when suddenly a command to inspect came from the shore, followed by rapid gunfire and flying bullets. Forced to stop, more than 20 bandits armed with short guns and knives swarmed aboard in four small boats. They arbitrarily searched and robbed, emptying all cash and valuables. Then they boarded their boats and went ashore. It was later learned that the purser on the ferry lost 6 million in cash, and the losses of passengers were incalculable. After the robbery, as the ferry steamed away, its sister ship, the "Xinyunsheng," arrived from Ji'an. The same group of bandits fired at it, forcing it to dock and board for a thorough search. One passenger, identifying himself as a soldier, shouted, "Comrades, don't harm people!" The bandits immediately shot him, saying, "You can't control this!" Fortunately, the shot missed. Another bandit fired a bullet that hit him in the abdomen, causing profuse bleeding. Two other bandits dragged him out, threw him into the water, and fired another shot, sinking the body immediately. The robbery lasted three hours before they disappeared with shouts. The losses on that ferry amounted to at least tens of millions. After the incident, the company reported it to the military and police, requesting an investigation and arrest.</p>
<p>The Nanxun Road is the gateway from Jiangxi to the Yangtze River. However, there were three vehicle robberies in two days. Earlier this month, a vehicle from the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration and a merchant vehicle were robbed by armed bandits a few kilometers from each side of Zhanggongdu. Three days later, passenger vehicle No. 31902 of the China Trading Company, en route from the provincial capital to Xunyang, was near Gutang, outside Jiujiang, when gunfire erupted near dusk. Several bullets struck the vehicle, forcing it to stop. A girl surnamed Qi among the passengers was struck by a bullet that entered from the base of her right ear, causing serious injury. Another youth was shot through his right arm, both bleeding profusely and in a terrible state. Seven or eight bandits carrying guns boarded the vehicle, searched and robbed for half an hour, then fled into the mountains with 50 million in loot.</p>
<p>Road and River Protection</p>
<p>With such a fierce robbery trend, coupled with rising prices and increasingly difficult living conditions, things are bound to escalate as the weather gets colder and the year ends. The Provincial Security Headquarters, taking the frequent robbery cases very seriously with the winter defense implementation imminent, has not only dispatched armed troops to protect roads and waterways but has also ordered all counties to implement joint defense and patrol, repair existing bunkers, recruit scattered soldiers and vagrants, and strictly inspect firearms for prevention. As for the bandits flowing in the Gan-Yue (Guangdong)-Xiang (Hunan) border, the Gan-Zhe (Zhejiang)-Min (Fujian) border, and the Gan-Zhe-Wan (Anhui) border, they will be cleared by the military in coordination with local militias. Scattered bandits will be the responsibility of local militias. From December to February of next year, during the winter defense period, all military and police in various regions must closely protect the locality and maintain security in accordance with the winter defense plan.</p>
<h3>Entire Group of Baolizhang (chiefs) Accuse Zhenzhang (head) of Beiku of Extortion</h3>
<p>[Wujiang News] Since taking office, Fei Xichun, the head of Beiku Township in Wujiang, has used the pretext of developing local projects to force the people of each Bao and Jia to pay rice, one Sheng and five He per Mu, without exception.

Now, all the Baolizhang of the Township have filed a complaint with the Wujiang Local Procuratorate, accusing him of corruption, dereliction of duty, and obstruction of freedom. The Prosecutor has opened a court hearing, and the plaintiffs presented conclusive evidence in court. The Prosecutor will file a public prosecution to punish the corrupt official according to the law and serve as a warning.

<h3>Simultaneous Dredging of the Three Major Ponds in Haining Commences</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Haining News] Due to the collapse of the seawall in this County, the Ningguo, Ningyuan, and Cuijiang three major ponds were silted up, obstructing traffic and severely affecting crops.

<h3>Zhejiang Province Land Registration Consolidation Plan to be Completed within Three Years</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Hangzhou News] Regarding the land registration consolidation work in Zhejiang Province, the land administration authorities have now formulated a plan, ordering all counties and cities to complete it within three years. The main points of the land registration consolidation plan are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Complete the consolidation of land registration throughout the Province within three years, starting with flat land and then moving to mountainous land. All procedures will be carried out in accordance with Central Government laws and regulations. All counties that have already issued land maps and certificates will convert to land registration. Those that have already conducted land survey and registration should continue to do so. Those that have not conducted surveys will start in the 36th year [of the Republic, i.e. 1947].</p>
<p>(2) Although the Central Government has allocated some funds for land registration consolidation in recent years, the amount is very small and insufficient. The expenses of each county rely on the revenue from registration certificates and village materials. It is now planned to recommend to the Central Government to increase the standard of certificate fees and to collect fees from landowners for materials and surveying. Before land registration is completed, landowners will be allowed to borrow in advance or obtain loans from banks to finance the work.</p>
<p>(3) In addition to training technical cadres and triangulation surveying personnel, other practical staff will be trained as needed.</p>
<p>(4) For areas where land registration consolidation has been completed, if there are significant changes in land prices, a reassessment will be conducted according to law.</p>
<p>(5) Strictly implement district supervision and thorough technical inspection to ensure rapid and accurate progress.</p>
<p>(6) Land registration consolidation should be closely linked to household registration. The names on the land register and the household registration book must be consistent.</p>

<p>To the Editor: I read with dismay the article published on page 3 of your newspaper on the 5th of this month, entitled "Security Team's Attempt to Confiscate Funds Failed, and Self-Defense Team's Weapons Were Seized." On the Double Tenth Festival, our team was stationed in Likou and ordered to suppress bandits. As for the forced donation of 60,000 yuan from various villages and the confiscation of weapons from the Likou South and Likou North self-defense teams, there is no such fact. I recently heard that the responsible persons of the two villages of Li South and Li North sent letters to your newspaper stating the facts and requesting a correction. Our team has reported the above to higher levels and requested a secret investigation. As it concerns military reputation, I am writing to request a correction.

<h3>Jiangsu Provincial Government Stipulates Regulations for Handling Addictive and Non-Addictive Opium Offenders</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Suzhou 17th Dispatch] The Jiangsu Provincial Government believes that the handling of addictive and non-addictive opium offenders in various counties promoting anti-drug policies is often divergent, which greatly affects the effectiveness of anti-drug policies. Therefore, in accordance with laws and regulations, it has formulated regulations and ordered various counties to follow them in order to unify the handling of such cases. The regulations are as follows: (1) Opium addicts caught in the act, even if they are proven to be addicted and non-addictive, should be prosecuted. (2) Those accused of opium addiction who are proven to be addicted and non-addictive, if they cannot provide sufficient evidence to prove that they have been falsely accused or have voluntarily undergone treatment, should be punished as appropriate, even if they were not caught in the act. (3) Those who were addicted to opium but have voluntarily undergone treatment before being discovered, and who are proven to be addicted and non-addictive, cannot be prosecuted if there is no evidence to prove that they have continued to use opium after treatment. (4) Those who have been addicted to opium and have quit through treatment or compulsory treatment, and who are subsequently found to be addicted and non-addictive, will not be prosecuted if there is no evidence to prove that they have relapsed.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu's In-Kind Land Tax Collection Overcomes Difficulties and is Progressing Smoothly, Completion Within the Deadline is in Sight and Expected to be Successfully Completed</h3>
<p>— Our Newspaper Reporter Li Xianglin</p>
<p>Zhenjiang News</p>
<p>Since the Jiangsu Provincial Government and the Provincial Land and Food Office held a provincial Land and Food Business Review Conference on July 20th of this year, they have actively launched preparations for the start of in-kind collection work. During this preparation period, it encountered many difficulties. The major premise of this difficulty is that Jiangsu Province was the first to suffer eight years of enemy devastation. This is not only the case for the food administration, but also for various other undertakings, due to the loss of balance of manpower and resources, forming a weak syndrome like a patient's poor nutrition after illness. However, the fact is the opposite. Since the in-kind land tax collection in Jiangsu started on September 15, although the preparation period was quite short, its gains and achievements have a considerable foundation. Its difficulties and weaknesses have gradually been broken through and dissipated, and this historically difficult and heavy burden is being promoted smoothly in 38 counties and cities in Jiangsu Province. According to Deputy Director Hong Qichen, who recently returned to the province from inspecting various counties in Jiangnan, in a conversation with our reporter: This trip to Wujiang, Suzhou, Changshu, Kunshan, and other four counties was generally very successful. All staff members were able to uphold the government's intentions and work hard to serve, which is very gratifying. All of the above counties have started collection. Because all the registers in Wujiang have been fully issued, the collection is very smooth and there are no difficulties whatsoever. The registers of Suzhou, Changshu, and Kunshan counties are currently being rushed day and night, and will be fully completed in a short period of time. The institutions of township offices and collection warehouses in each county have also been established one after another. When the reporter asked about the results after the start of collection in various counties and cities in the province, he replied: As of the 10th of this month, according to the reports to the Provincial Office, Zhenjiang has more than 2,000 Shi, Gaochun has more than 2,000 Shi, Taizhou has more than 9,000 Shi, Liuhe has more than 18,000 Shi, Yangzhou has 1,500 Shi, Jiangning has 30,000 Shi, Danyang has 3,500 Shi, Jiangpu has 7,500 Shi, Yizheng has more than 5,600 Shi, Jiangdu has more than 6,300 Shi, Liyang has more than 2,300 Shi, Jurong has more than 5,700 Shi, all of which are counties that collect rice. Among them, Gaochun, Jiangning, Liuhe, and Yizheng are collecting more slowly because there is more late rice and the harvest is not continuous. The counties that pay in legal tender, Nantong, are more than 2 million yuan, and Taicang is more than 150 million yuan. According to Hong, in the final statement, Jiangsu's land tax has finally smoothly embarked on a smooth path. This is certainly due to the assistance of various local forces, and at the same time, I feel exceptionally gratified with the spirit of the staff. I hope this spirit will be maintained permanently, then, although the deadline of December 15 is not far away, it must be able to be completed successfully.</p>
<p>Four Ways</p>
<p>According to Mao Junbai, the section chief of the Management Department of the Provincial Land and Food Office, the actual situation of Jiangsu's in-kind land tax collection is as follows: Before the start of in-kind collection, because the preparation period was rushed, coupled with Jiangsu's congenital imbalance, in order to adapt to local conditions and suit the environment, it was collected in four ways: (1) collection of rice, (2) collection of wheat, (3) collection of cotton, (4) payment in legal tender. In counties and cities that collect rice, the original regular and surcharge taxes are calculated and temporarily converted by 40%. Each yuan of tax is collected with 3 Shi Dou of rice, 1 Shi Dou is borrowed, and 9 Shi Sheng of public grain (30%) is collected, for a total of 4 Shi Dou and 9 Shi Sheng (that is, each yuan of tax is actually collected with 1 Dou and 9 Sheng and 6 He). The counties that collect wheat are calculated at 70% of the rice, that is, each yuan is collected with 2 Shi Dou and 1 Shi Sheng, 7 Shi Sheng is borrowed, and 6 Shi Sheng and 3 He (30%) of public grain is collected, for a total of 3 Shi Dou and 4 Shi Sheng and 3 He (that is, each yuan of tax is actually collected with 1 Shi Dou and 3 Sheng and 7 He). The inspection tools for the aforementioned in-kind collection use standard weighing instruments and take Shi Jin as the unit. Two or less is rounded down, rice is 108 Shi Jin per Shi Shi, and wheat is 145 Shi Jin per Shi Shi.</p>
<p>Adapt to Local Conditions</p>
<p>There are a total of 27 counties that collect rice, namely: Jiangning, Gaochun, Jurong, Liyang, Lishui, Danyang, Jintan, Yixing, Wujin, Wuxi, Suzhou, Wujiang, Changshu, Jiangyin, Qingpu, Jinshan, Songjiang, Kunshan, Yangzhong, Jiangdu, Liuhe, Yizheng, Jiangpu, Zhenjiang, Taixian, Jingjiang, Chuansha, etc. The total amount to be paid by the above counties is 3,881,052 Shi Shi. There are three counties that collect wheat, namely: Xuzhou City, Tongshan, and Donghai, with a total of 37,403 Shi of wheat to be collected. There is only Chongming County that collects cotton. Because the county produces miscellaneous grains, it has been changed to pay more than 50,000 Shi of corn. There are seven counties that pay in legal tender: Shanghai, Taicang, Baoshan, Jiading, Nanhui, and Fengxian, with a total amount of 15.7 billion yuan to be collected. Finally, according to Mao, if all 38 counties collect all the taxes by December 15 of this year, with each yuan paying 1 Dou 9 Sheng 6 He, there may be more than 4,715,000 Shi, and the central government can get 1.7 million Shi, and the city and county can also get 1.7 million Shi. The rest can be kept for provincial use. If this is the case, the establishment of the national food administration, the adjustment of military and civilian food, the funding of provincial and county expenses, and the desire to build a new Jiangsu will often be easy to achieve.</p>
<p>Situation in Northern Jiangsu</p>
<p>Finally, the reporter asked whether land taxes could be exempted in the counties in northern Jiangsu after their recovery. The answer was: The Provincial Government and the Provincial Provisional Council have repeatedly appealed to the Central Government to exempt land taxes in northern Jiangsu for one year. It is now heard that this matter may be approved. The reasons for the exemption are nothing more than two points: (1) Northern Jiangsu has been devastated by enemies, puppets, and bandits in the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War. After the victory, it was again occupied by the Communist army. The local vitality has been greatly damaged, and the rural areas have been extremely bankrupt. Although the counties have been recovered one after another, they were all forcibly requisitioned and taken away by the Communist army during the period of occupation. Even if there are any leftovers, they are not many; (2) The efficiency of in-kind collection is not enough, because the registers of the recovered counties are lost and the household registration is chaotic, which cannot be done without a considerable period of sorting. From the above facts, Jiangsu's in-kind land tax collection has finally been promoted smoothly. We hope that this major event can be completed quickly and on schedule.</p>
<h3>Special Port Problem Breakthrough: Four Foreign Ministers Reach Agreement on Governor's Authority</h3>
<p>[Report from our New York Correspondent, 17th] The four foreign ministers are making final efforts on the Trieste Free Territory issue to reach a compromise. Not long ago, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov proposed fourteen amendments, insisting that these were minimum conditions and could not be altered. However, Molotov's attitude has softened in recent days, and US Secretary of State Byrnes is said to share this sentiment. Once the Trieste issue is resolved, the four powers can draft the final draft of the peace treaties with Italy, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Finland, and then proceed to draft a peace treaty with Germany.</p>
<p>[United Press, New York, 16th] Today's four-power foreign ministers' meeting overcame a key hurdle regarding the future of the port of Trieste, paving the way for a peace treaty with Italy. According to attendees, the four foreign ministers are close to reaching an agreement on the administration of the port. US Secretary of State Byrnes insisted on upholding the rights of minorities and the foundation of the United Nations. Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov has apparently shown compromise, agreeing that the Trieste government has supreme authority, and withdrawing the original demand to reduce government power. Undersecretaries of State are now responsible for drafting today's agreement into articles for presentation at the meeting on the 18th.</p>
<p>[United Press, New York, 17th] The foreign ministers' meeting made progress today on resolving the issue of Trieste's administration, but encountered new obstacles regarding the deadline for the withdrawal of occupying forces. At the close of today's meeting, it was decided to refer the issue of who should manage the Trieste police to French Undersecretary of State Couve de Murville to draft an agreement. Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov's renewed proposal of a deadline for the withdrawal of occupying forces from Trieste may hinder the foreign ministers' reaching a resolution.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, New York, 17th] During today's four foreign ministers' meeting, a compromise plan proposed by the French representative regarding the powers of the governor of Trieste and the local security director was discussed and generally passed. It was immediately handed over to the four undersecretaries for final review. The plan stipulates four points:</p>
<p>(1) The position of security director of the Trieste Free Territory shall be appointed and dismissed by the governor after consultation with the local Administrative Committee. The security director is responsible for thoroughly recruiting and dismissing security personnel. (2) In peacetime, the security director is supervised by the Administrative Committee. The committee regularly listens to the director's reports and discusses with him all matters within his authority. (3) The governor attends the Administrative Committee, listens to the committee's instructions to the security director, and participates in the discussion when necessary. The governor may also permit or oppose the implementation of various administrative measures. (4) If the governor believes that an emergency has occurred that is sufficient to violate the independence and integrity of the free zone or infringe upon human rights, he may personally order appropriate measures to be taken and report to the United Nations Security Council. The governor may also personally command the security forces when necessary.</p>
<p>Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov believes that the definition of "emergency situation" should be limited to events affecting the independence and integrity of the area. This is only a matter of definition and will be resolved by the undersecretaries' meeting tomorrow. Before adjourning today, the issue of the withdrawal of foreign troops from the Trieste area was reviewed, but no agreement was reached.</p>

<h3>Veto Problem in the Security Council: Gu Weijun Expresses His Views, UN General Assembly Political Committee Suspends Debate, Five Major Powers to Discuss Restrictions Today</h3>
<p>[Special dispatch from the Central News Agency, New York, 16th] My chief representative Gu Weijun seconded the principle of great power unanimity today during the first discussion of the veto dispute in the Political and Security Committee of the General Assembly. In his speech, Gu opposed the proposals of Australia and Cuba to restrict or abolish the veto power stipulated in Article 27 of the United Nations Charter, but suggested improving the most practical ways to apply Article 27 as follows: (1) Adopt a long-term plan to study and gradually improve its proper use; (2) Improve procedural regulations through discussion, definition, and regulation; (3) Reach a freely agreed and commonly recognized interpretation. Gu, like all other permanent members of the Security Council, also firmly opposed amending the Charter. He stated that the Chinese delegation does not believe that the time for amending the Charter has arrived. This document is the actual reason for the principle of unanimous intent of our United Nations organization. The consensus that exists today is the same as it was when the Charter was signed. Any rash attempt to amend the Charter at this time could fundamentally shake the foundation of our organization. Gu proposed two of the most practical ways to solve the veto problem: (1) Suggest that the Security Council take steps to promote a more complete and rational application of Article 27 and improve its procedures. (2) Request that the five permanent members provide detailed explanations of the statements made at the San Francisco Conference on the application of the veto power, and, where possible, list the items that only require procedural votes.</p>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 16th] France today proposed to the Political Committee of the UN General Assembly to suspend debate on the veto issue pending prior discussion by the five major powers. British representative Noel-Baker then spoke, severely criticizing the Soviet Union for abusing the veto power, which caused various issues that could have been resolved unanimously to be hindered everywhere due to the Soviet Union's extreme unilateralism. However, Noel-Baker also expressed the same firm opposition to amending the UN Charter as the four major powers, as requested by the smaller countries. Saudi Arabia advocated that the General Assembly suspend discussion of the veto issue, and Noel-Baker expressed support. It has now been decided that the five permanent members of the Security Council will decide on restrictions on its use themselves in New York on Monday. British Foreign Secretary Bevin, Chinese Ambassador to the United States Gu Weijun, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, US Secretary of State Byrnes, and French representative Parodi have all agreed to participate. Although there was no opposition to the French proposal to suspend discussion in the General Assembly, it was not put to a vote today, pending the speeches of the three countries' representatives who had already registered to speak after the meeting on Monday. In any case, the decision of the five major powers to meet on Monday will not change. After the Political Committee suspends discussion of the veto issue, it will proceed to discuss the second issue, which is the Soviet Union's request that all countries report the number of foreign troops stationed in their countries. The veto issue will be discussed again after the five major powers submit a report from their meeting.</p>
<h3>On the Eve of the Romanian General Election, the US Lodges Fourth Protest</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 17th] Today, the United States sent a fourth note to the Romanian government, protesting again against the preparations for the election next Tuesday. This move appears to be the last protest before the election. The United States, as one of the three responsible countries for implementing "free" elections in Romania, lodged this protest with strong language, urging the Moscow-backed Romanian government not to forget its promises. It also accused the Romanian government again of not allowing the opposition to use newspapers and radio for campaigning, repeatedly preventing the opposition from holding political rallies, and even of government-sponsored violence and widespread abuse of the opposition.</p>
<p>[United Press, Rome, 17th] The British and American governments are now planning to lodge another protest with the Romanian government regarding its actions related to the election next Tuesday. It is reported that the note will express dissatisfaction with Romania's response to the previous protests of the UK and the US. On the eve of the election, Romania is engaged in a heated last-minute campaign. Campaign slogans are plastered on the walls of Bucharest for miles, and trucks with loudspeakers are broadcasting propaganda. The first-time participation of women in Romanian elections has further intensified the campaign. Romanian Interior Minister Gheorghe, a Communist, told the press today that he expects some bloodshed during the election, but no major incidents. He also admitted that 200 opposition members have been arrested and imprisoned, but said that all but those who will be tried by military tribunals have been released and can participate in the campaign.</p>
<h3>UN General Assembly Committee Passes Equal Rights for Women Resolution</h3>
<p>I Approve of the Danish Proposal</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from the Central News Agency, New York, 16th] The Social, Humanitarian, and Cultural Committee of the UN General Assembly met today and passed a Danish proposal recommending that the General Assembly suggest that member states take measures to ensure that women obtain equal rights with men in politics. Chinese representative Madame Niu Huizhen approved of the Danish proposal and stated that China has already recognized that its women enjoy equal rights with men in politics. She also pointed out that the Chinese National Political Council and its Presidium already have female members (participating, and the draft Chinese Constitution also clearly stipulates that all Chinese citizens are equal before the law regardless of gender.</p>
<h3>Alarms Sound Loudly: It Turns Out to Be a Fire Drill, Four Foreign Ministers Get a False Alarm</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, New York, 17th] The four foreign ministers were holding a meeting at the Astoria Hotel here this afternoon when suddenly alarms sounded loudly outside. British Foreign Secretary Bevin suspected it was an air raid alarm. The four foreign ministers all left their seats and rushed to the window to investigate, only to discover that it was just a police and fire drill. They were relieved and returned to their seats for the meeting.</p>
<h3>British Prime Minister Takes a Wartime Stance to Deal with Splinter Party Members, Will Submit a Motion of Confidence to the Lower House, Eden Speech Supports Bevin's Diplomacy</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 16th] Prime Minister Attlee is preparing to take a wartime stance and request a vote of confidence from the Lower House for the first time on the 18th to deal with the "rebellious" actions within the Labour Party against his policies. Government sources claimed today that Attlee will use this move to prove how weak the forces of the four Labour Party rebel members are. Whether the Prime Minister will move to extremes will depend on the debate of the "rebel" members at the meeting on the 18th.</p>
<p>[United Press, Newcastle, England, 16th] Former British Foreign Secretary Eden delivered a speech here today, expressing his firm trust in the current Foreign Secretary Bevin. Eden did not mention the resistance of a small number of Labour MPs to the government's foreign policy, but said that Bevin is now proceeding on the right path. As far as he knows, he is seeking to establish the power of the United Nations organization and strengthen the effectiveness of international law, which is the only policy that Britain should adopt.</p>
<h3>Communist Party Holds a Large Meeting in Jerusalem</h3>
<p>Busy Military Movements in the Middle East</p>
<p>[Report from our Correspondent in London, 17th] The British authorities are very concerned about the situation in Jerusalem. According to the intelligence agency spokesman's words to reporters: Today, a small team of British troops on the Baliwei highway hit a landmine, killing and injuring more than a dozen people. Also, on the anniversary of the Soviet October Revolution, the Communist Party of Palestine held a conference in Jerusalem, urging Jews and Arabs to unite against British and American imperialism.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 17th] The Sunday Times Jerusalem correspondent said: Military movements in the Middle East are very busy. By the beginning of January next year, the military and police strength in Palestine will reach 125,000. Today, troops from Egypt, Italy, and the Far East are being sent to Palestine. The movement is limited to one battalion at a time, but its goal is to have two infantry divisions, a division of armored and airborne forces each.</p>
<p>[United Press, Jerusalem, 17th] Reliable military sources here claimed today that the estimated number of British troops currently stationed in Palestine is 100,000, which may double within the year, including four full combat divisions. The British move is largely due to the fact that a decision on the Jewish-Arab issue in the Holy Land may be made after January 1, and more troops must be dispatched to implement this decision.</p>
<h3>Large Gold Mine Discovered in Western Australia</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 16th] Eleven Italian miners recently discovered one of the world's richest gold mines near Kalgoorlie in Western Australia. They have already excavated six tons of rock and extracted gold sand worth US$851,000.</p>

<h3>Greek Guerrilla Warfare Still Raging: Government Denies Sending Armored Troops into Macedonia</h3>
<p>[Report from our London Correspondent, 17th] The Greek situation is very tense, and guerrilla warfare is ongoing. The night before last, a team of 300 numbered troops attacked Yazhangqi Si, killing 4 Greek soldiers and injuring 7; raided Ouwu and left 50 corpses behind, retreating towards Yugoslavia.

<h3>It Is Said That Britain and the United States Intend to Treat Shigemitsu Leniently</h3>
<p>The Soviet Union Holds a Deep Grudge Against Him</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 16th] There is widespread speculation here about the Tokyo International Military Tribunal's abandoning the trial of former Japanese Foreign Minister Shigemitsu Mamoru. It is said that the American prosecutor is unwilling to list Shigemitsu alongside other war criminals as defendants, and wishes to release him. The following points are said to be under consideration: (1) Shigemitsu is now disabled, having been injured in the leg by a bomb in Shanghai. (2) Shigemitsu represented Japan last year in signing the Japanese surrender document on the American battleship Missouri. (3) After the outbreak of the Pacific War in 1941, he sent a secret letter to US Ambassador to Japan Grew. Observers say that the British prosecutor also intends to treat Shigemitsu leniently, because during his tenure as ambassador to the United Kingdom, Shigemitsu indicated to his government that war would lead to catastrophe and therefore requested that the authorities use peaceful means to expand their power. On the other hand, the Soviet Union holds a deep grudge against Shigemitsu because in 1930, when he was in Moscow, he threatened former Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov, attempting to force the Soviet Union to make concessions on the "Manchurian" border.</p>
<h3>Pauley Report on Japanese Reparations Published</h3>
<p>[United Press from the Central News Agency, Washington, 16th] Ambassador Pauley, the representative of the Allied Reparations Commission, suggested to President Truman that all Japanese manufacturing materials and artificial rubber, aluminum, and magnesium factories be shipped out. He also suggested that a large number of Japanese electrical factories, steel and alloy factories, and oil refining, railway, merchant ship, and other equipment be shipped out. Pauley's report also suggested that certain Japanese industries be completely included in the list of reparations materials. These industries are handicrafts and light industries that are necessary for the reconstruction of Japan. The disposal of the Japanese woolen textile, artificial fiber, cotton, and paper industries will be discussed in the future. The US State Department has now released Pauley's recommendations.</p>
<h3>Pope Pius XII Will Convene Christmas Bishops' Conference to Appoint Five Cardinals</h3>

<h3>Japan During the Occupation (Part 2) - The Occupation Work is Divided into Three Stages</h3>
<p>— By P. Lauter, Tokyo Correspondent for the New York Times, Translated by Zhang Degan</p>
<p>The Japanese government has accepted the order to end all support for State Shintoism. Shintoism, through its 110,000 shrines, has deeply penetrated the lives of 75 million Japanese people, forcing them to at least verbally acknowledge the Emperor as a god and the Japanese as descendants of gods who must act on behalf of heaven to rule the world. All auxiliary organs through which the Japanese military clique exercised its power have been eliminated, and hopefully, they are eliminated forever. This includes the secret police, thought police, news censorship, military training in schools, and military life, etc.</p>
<p>By the end of the year, the second phase of the occupation, namely the eradication of feudalism, will be almost complete. Although new elements are still being purged and many new war criminals are yet to be exposed, it may still be necessary to use force to threaten and prevent the resurgence of bad tendencies or the emergence of new undesirable elements.</p>
<p>The third phase of the occupation is still ahead of us because the new institutions have been subjected to various pressures and threats from within and without. The food problem, the production problem, and the financial problem are all very serious, with no solution in sight—only temporary measures, such as importing some American military rations to feed the Japanese.</p>
<p>In the first year of the occupation, the United States expressed its responsibility to solve these many problems, otherwise, it would have to admit the failure of the US policy toward Japan. If possible, it should restart and do it again. However, the various issues of the third phase are extremely important and worthy of detailed study in themselves.</p>
<p>Japan's economic situation is so bad that no country would willingly sacrifice butter and consume its national wealth on guns and cannons to avoid it. They must rely on exports to have food to eat, and to export, they must manufacture—they must also pay an unknown amount of reparations, most of which must be paid with machinery. Japan's material well-being is naturally Japan's fundamental problem, but as far as this reporter knows, no one dares to advocate allowing Japan to rebuild its old military strength to revive the Japanese Empire. However, this is also a United Nations problem because economic collapse leads to chaos, and in the past, chaos has led to violent politics, which has led to war. The current chaos in Japan, once the time is ripe, could create a new Pacific War, just as the chaos in Germany eventually produced Hitler.</p>
<p>The supreme leader of the entire occupation apparatus is MacArthur—who himself happened to be demobilized from the battlefield to become an administrative official; his demobilization was much easier than that of many GIs who left the army and returned home to tinker with gasoline barrels. He must follow the general principles of the Potsdam Declaration and carry out the instructions of the Far Eastern Commission; however, he is the Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces, and his position is strictly a "one-man position."</p>
<p>According to most observers, the United Nations Control Commission for Japan provides little valuable assistance to MacArthur's headquarters. Some pessimists even call it a "debating society" whose main function is to allow the representatives of the United Nations to vent their anger. Even without this committee, the occupation work would have been done to the same extent as it is today.</p>
<p>MacArthur's face seems slightly older than when this reporter first set foot in the Southwest Pacific Theater in the summer of 1944 in Australia; however, there is no significant change, although the energy he has spent on the war and the occupation work is enormous. He lives with his wife and young son Arthur in the American Embassy. He has a small office in an insurance company building in the city, with dark wood panels on the walls, two landscape paintings hanging, and a glass-door bookcase behind it, which is empty.</p>
<p>MacArthur's working hours are very long but strangely scheduled. He gets up very early, handles part of his official business at home, and does not go to the office until 11 o'clock. He may not leave the office for lunch until 2 o'clock, and then return to the office to work for two hours, not leaving until long after the usual dinner time. MacArthur has almost no social life. The embassy's dinner parties have been reduced to a minimum, and he only attends the most solemn banquets. In the past, during the arduous fighting of the first landing in the Philippines, everyone hid in their shelters, but he was accustomed to strolling in the corridor with his head exposed, watching the Japanese bombs fall. Like him, even his own subordinates know very little about him to this day.</p>
<p>The purely military tasks in the occupation work are handled by General Eichelberger, who has traveled thousands of miles throughout Japan to investigate how his Eighth Army soldiers are living, feeling, working, and playing. MacArthur has only left Tokyo once, to go to the Philippines to attend the Independence Day celebration.</p>
<p>What is the Japanese reaction to the first year of the occupation? This is a very difficult question to answer. In fact, the Japanese have not only offered no resistance but are extremely willing to cooperate. However, after the occupying forces withdraw in the future, will the Japanese be willing to maintain the system we have established? Or will they modify it? Or will they overthrow it completely? It depends on how the Japanese evaluate the system and what its actual results are. Most Japanese people's opinions on the system are perhaps yet to be decided and, of course, have not been expressed at all.</p>

<h3>Municipal Party Headquarters Hosts Cultural and Film Industry Figures: Appeals for Building a New Culture - Runaway US Dollar, Soaring Prices of Noodles, Meat, and Coal Are the Work of the Communists - The Situation Is Grave, the People Should Understand Right and Wrong</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] The Municipal Party Headquarters held a reception yesterday afternoon at 3 PM at the Police and Social Affairs Office on Shaoxing Road, inviting over a hundred figures from the city's cultural, film, and theater industries, including Mayor Wu, Speaker Pan, Chairman Fang, and prominent figures from all walks of life. During the reception, discussions were held on the current direction of the cultural movement, the current political situation, and the issue of exposing traitors in the film and theater industries. Mayor Wu also revealed for the first time that the soaring prices of pork, flour, and coal, and the runaway US dollar, are due to the sabotage and manipulation of the Communist Party. Li Pingqian reported that during the fall of Shanghai, film industry figures who remained in Shanghai followed the instructions of Jiang Bocheng, Wu Kaixian, and Wu Shaoshu to stand their ground and prevent the enemy puppets from seizing control. As for the films produced by "Huaying," most people believe that only "Spring River's Regret" and a small portion of "Wan Shi Liu Fang" are problematic.</p>
<p>Party Affairs and Cultural Work Should Be Integrated</p>
<p>Fang Zhi began by stating, "We have invited you here today not for a mere social gathering. Party affairs work should be integrated with cultural work, and we want to take this opportunity to exchange views with you and make some points. First, we hope that the cultural figures will promote culture and civilization. Today, Chinese culture has not yet reached the level that the people of the whole country hope for. Moreover, in some regions, the sound of gunfire continues, and the people are displaced and living in turmoil. We should do our best to promote the Four Cardinal Principles and Eight Virtues, as the basic principles of propriety, justice, integrity, and honor, as well as loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, love, trustworthiness, righteousness, and peace, are fundamental to maintaining the existence of the Chinese nation. We must popularize this inherent culture and express it in all aspects of point, line, and quality. Second, we should build a new culture and a new country. The so-called new culture is the Three Principles of the People's culture that the people of the whole country need. Everyone can love the country and the nation, everyone can do their best and get what they need, and everyone can manage themselves with the Three Principles of the People's culture. The spirit of the Three Principles of the People's culture includes peace, happiness, democracy, and unity. This is what the Chinese people truly need. Using guns to fight our own compatriots and destroying peace and unity is the culture of the Communist Party. We must first build a new culture of the Three Principles of the People before we can build a new China of the Three Principles of the People. Third, the cultural circles should strengthen unity, exert the power of the cultural circles, unite together, and cooperate. Finally, Fang said, I still want to say a few fair words, because recently there has been a sudden accusation that there are suspected traitors in the film and theater circles, making friends in the film and theater circles feel insecure and unable to work in peace. In fact, some of those who have been accused are those who followed the instructions of underground comrades of the Party Headquarters to stay in Shanghai and stand their ground. How can they be called traitors? If we want to deal with it, we should deal with the organizers. I hope everyone can unite, remove those who are rebellious, and jointly clear the wronged.</p>
<p>Should Recognize the Truth and Serve the People</p>
<p>Next, Mayor Wu spoke, saying that there can be a simple answer to the so-called culture, that is, the difference between humans and animals. The biggest difference between humans and animals is that animals are completely selfish, while humans are able to be unselfish and unselfish. People have compassion, sympathy, a sense of truth, and courage to do what is right. The so-called high cultural level is to pursue the truth, have compassion, be unselfish and unselfish, and serve the public. Since I took office in Shanghai in May, the Communist Party has become radicalized because what the Communist Party has done violates the above standards. Since May, I have tried to stabilize prices, but sometimes there is no way. It is true that some price increases are due to profiteers seeking only profit, but another part is not caused by profiteers. For example, there is no way to deal with pork because the meat is transported from Jiangbei, the Soviet area under Communist control. Merchants transporting pigs must first provide a receipt, and after returning, they must pay taxes in US dollars and gold bars. How can the price of meat not rise? After the retreat, the piglets in northern Jiangsu were either killed or taken away, resulting in a lack of sources. Secondly, wheat, this year there was a bumper harvest in northern Jiangsu, but the Communist Party either transported the wheat away or burned the wheat, so the price of flour in Shanghai had to be adjusted. Thirdly, the city is short of coal this winter, which is also a gift from the Communist Party. If the Tianjin-Pukou Railway were open and the coal mines were not destroyed, there would be no problem with coal in Shanghai. The rumors of rising US dollars and exchange rate fluctuations are due to the Communist Party using counterfeit currency to extract 120 billion yuan in legal tender and searching the market, causing panic. The Communist Party talks about peace and unity on the surface, but in reality, everything they do is destructive, so cultural figures should recognize the truth and serve the people.</p>
<p>The Situation is Indeed Serious, But Not Hopeless</p>
<p>Then, Speaker Pan Gongzhan spoke, first describing his personal love for drama and film and his emphasis on the correct use of the effects of film and drama. He also explained that the decision to suspend the drama school was made by the Senate, not by the Speaker personally or any Senator. The Senate represents all the citizens of Shanghai, not a certain aspect or a certain region. The Senate's decision at that time was based on the fact that the city government's funds were insufficient, and there were too many school-age children who were out of school. At this time and place, national schools were more urgent than drama schools. There was no intention to belittle drama schools or drama. As for whether the Senate's motion needs to be reconsidered, it should be decided by the Mayor. What the result of the reconsideration will be depends on the opinions of all the Senators. The current situation has indeed reached a critical juncture. However, it is not hopeless. Because at first, the Communist Party said that if the National Army took Zhangjiakou, it would be a split. After Zhangjiakou was taken, they suddenly changed their tune and said that the key to the situation was the ceasefire. And after the government issued a ceasefire order, they said that it was a unilateral ceasefire, which was equivalent to fighting. I really don't know what kind of logic this is. The National Army's ceasefire is a unilateral ceasefire, which means that the Communist Army still wants to fight. If the Communist Army is also willing to have a unilateral ceasefire, wouldn't that be a ceasefire on both sides? Even so, it has not broken down. The Communist Party changed its name to convene the National Assembly and it will break down. Now that the National Assembly has been convened, the Communist Party calls it a one-party monopolized divided National Assembly and will not participate. It also said that if the National Army attacks Yan'an, it will be a complete break. Zhou Enlai also said that peace talks can still be reopened. It can be seen that it is not completely hopeless. But if we want the Communist Party to participate, the only way is for the real people to speak up, then the Communist Party will have to come. The people should have right and wrong, and they should have judgment. I hope you will recognize the truth. The current situation depends on two forces, either the power of the people decides, or another greater force decides. If the people are to decide, we must rely on the cultural circles to awaken our compatriots. General Fu Zuoyi said that the places where the Communist Party has been are like getting a vaccination, meaning that only those who have suffered from the Communist Party know its harm.</p>
<p>Speaker Pan also explained the accusation of traitors in the film and theater industries, according to the central government's laws and regulations, only those in the film and theater industries who presided over propaganda for the enemy puppets are guilty. The newspaper reported that it was an investigation case, and if the investigation is innocent, the prosecutor will not prosecute.</p>
<p>Other speakers included Li Pingqian, Shi Dongshan, Yao Pengzi, Ying Yunwei, etc. Finally, there was also entertainment, and the event ended at about 6 o'clock.</p>

<h3>Black Market Trade in Blood Plasma - The Chairman is Extremely Concerned - Has Ordered the Department of Health to Thoroughly Investigate</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper, Nanjing, 17th] Song Ziwen met with reporters this afternoon to comment on the black market trade in American blood plasma, stating that this batch of blood plasma was sold directly to Shanghai merchants by the US Foreign Surplus Property Disposal Administration's Shanghai office and had nothing to do with the government. However, because it is the blood of Americans, the Chairman is paying close attention to it and has ordered the Department of Health to conduct a thorough investigation. Although our government is not responsible for it, we are also very concerned about it.</p>

<h3>Ten-Year Gas Plan - Experts Hired to Form a Technical Committee - The Municipal Public Utilities Bureau is Formulating Policies - Three Gas Plants Provide a Continuous Supply - Daily Production Reaches 10 Million Cubic Feet</h3>
<p>The Municipal Public Utilities Bureau has recently drafted a "Ten-Year Plan" for reorganizing the gas industry. According to Zhao Zengyu, the director of the bureau, the bureau has drafted a plan to develop the gas industry to meet the needs of 15 million citizens based on the current situation and future needs. According to the results of past years' statistics, there were only a few thousand gas users in the city before the war, with a daily output of about one million cubic feet. During the War of Resistance, people from all over the country concentrated in the urban area, and the population increased sharply. Due to the high cost of fuel, the number of people who switched to gas reached 20,000 households (19,000 households for the British Gas Company and 1,000 households for the Wusong Gas Plant). The daily gas production was 3.5 million cubic feet for the British factory and 500,000 cubic feet for the Wusong factory, for a total of 4 million cubic feet. However, the equipment of both factories was damaged by the enemy, and it was difficult to replenish equipment after the victory. After repeatedly increasing the usage limit, the current supply has reached the maximum load point, and it is impossible to increase production any further. Therefore, it is impossible to accept new users who apply for gas installation. In order to remedy the above difficulties, the Bureau has specially invited experts to form a gas technology conference to seek both stopgap and fundamental solutions from a technical point of view. The stopgap solution is to solve the current panic of gas supply. There are currently three steps being considered: (1) Using coal with a higher volatile content, which can increase gas production by about 25 to 30 percent. (2) Actively repairing existing gas generators to increase gas production efficiency and avoid shutdowns. (3) Advise users not to waste unnecessarily, so that every cubic foot of gas can be used to its maximum effect. These three steps are now being actively carried out and are expected to achieve satisfactory results within the year.</p>
<p>As for the fundamental solution, it will be based on the principle of cooperating with the Greater Shanghai Urban Plan, in order to build Greater Shanghai. At present, the city's population is only 4 million, and the gas supply is already felt to be insufficient. If the urban plan is implemented, the population will increase to 15 million. Therefore, the fundamental solution will be aimed at supplying the gas needs of a population of 15 million. The steps are divided into five items: (1) According to past records, gas consumption increases by 5% per year, calculated at compound interest. After ten years, gas consumption will increase to a daily output of 9 million cubic feet. In addition, due to the increase in industrial use, Shanghai will need 10 million cubic feet of gas in ten years. (2) It is planned to establish a new gas manufacturing plant along the Huangpu River in Nanshi, with a daily output of 4 to 5 million cubic feet. At the same time, the equipment of the Wusong Gas Plant will be expanded, and fume furnaces will be added to enable it to produce 2 million cubic feet of gas per day. Together with the British Yangshupu Plant's daily output of 4 million cubic feet, the city will have three gas plants located around Shanghai, collectively controlling the city's gas supply. (3) It is planned to lay a high-pressure pipe supply network and gas supply stations throughout the city, connecting the high-pressure pipes of the three plants to each other. If this is the case, when one plant has an obstacle, the other plants can supply gas in its place, so that the gas supply will never be interrupted. (4) Since the gas plants are located in three locations, the city's future gas supply area will also be divided into three major supply areas based on the location of the plants, namely the Wusong, Shishan, and Jiangwan industrial areas, which will be supplied by the Wusong Gas Plant; the city center, Yangshupu, Zhabei, Hongkou, and the area north of the Suzhou River, which are adjacent to the Yangshupu Plant, are planned to be supplied by the plant; the old French Concession in the city, Huxi, Nanshi, and other areas south of the Suzhou River will be supplied by the Nanshi Gas Plant. In this way, each district is close to the manufacturing plant, which is convenient for supply and ensures that the pressure is normal, without the problem of insufficient pressure. Its service efficiency can also be improved as a result. (5) Unified management of all plants, the British Gas and the Municipal Wusong Gas Plant, due to the exclusive contract relationship, operate in different areas, each going its own way, which is unreasonable, and its impact on the gas supply and the obstruction of the formation of the city's gas network is very large. Therefore, after the expiration of the British Gas Company's exclusive rights, the gas company will be merged to actively increase production under unified management.</p>
<h3>Fight Over Wharf Results in Violence - Two Wenzhou Gang Members Injured</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] The dockworkers at the Kangqu Bridge Wharf in Nanshi's Shihui Port were originally from the Wenzhou Gang. Recently, they were seized by the Jiangqin Gang. The Wenzhou Gang was unwilling to accept this, and although several mediations were made, they had little effect. It was originally scheduled that the Social Affairs Bureau would convene both parties this morning to seek a reasonable solution. However, at about 3 PM yesterday, Jiangbei Gang leader Shan Baoquan, also known as Shan Asi, first gathered dozens of workers and clashed with a small number of Wenzhou Gang workers in Jinfu Lane on Longhua Road. At that time, due to the disparity in numbers, Wenzhou Gang workers Ge Axi and Li Shunsen were injured. When the Longhua Branch reported this, the police were dispatched to the scene, but the murderers had already fled. The police are now investigating the matter.</p>
<h3>Wife Goes to Hotel for Secret Rendezvous - Husband Stabs Adulterer</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] Wang Ligui, 42 years old, from Zhenjiang, lives at No. 18, Dexing Lane, Yunnan South Road, and usually runs a sock stall. Three months ago, his wife had an affair with Ying Guoqing, a seal carver who had a stall nearby, and they often had secret rendezvous in hotels. Over time, their affair was exposed, and Wang found out about it, but he remained silent. One day, Ying and his wife borrowed a guest house to continue their pleasure. Wang rushed to catch them in the act and finally captured the adulterous couple. After people came forward to mediate, Ying wrote a letter of repentance and paid a settlement of 100,000 legal tender. However, at 9:30 PM last night, Wang Ligui learned from his 14-year-old daughter that his mother had gone to a hotel with Ying again. Wang became enraged and searched everywhere. As he was walking near Baxian Bridge, he happened to meet the adulterer Ying Guoqing head-on. Wang pulled out a sharp knife and stabbed him in the right arm and right middle finger, causing profuse bleeding. He was arrested by the police and taken to the Taishan Branch for investigation.</p>
<h3>Fugitive Criminals Captured in Zhabei</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] The Taishan Police Station received a tip a few days ago that fugitive criminals and their accomplices were hiding at No. 403, Guangfu Road, Zhabei. On the morning of the 15th, the branch dispatched a large number of police officers to the address, first surrounding it, and then a part of them bravely rushed in. Two notorious robbers were sleeping soundly and were arrested together. A revolver and four bullets were found in the closet and taken to the station for interrogation. According to Cao Bin and Zhu Baofu, they confessed to committing numerous crimes and were scheduled to be handed over to the garrison headquarters for legal prosecution.</p>
<h3>Trolleys and Buses - Officially Increase Fares Today - Route 8 Buses Also Start Running - Separate Preferential Measures for Military and Police Passengers</h3>
<p>The fares for buses and trolleys in the city will officially increase today. First-class trolley tickets are divided into four types: 200 yuan, 300 yuan, 400 yuan, and 500 yuan. Second-class tickets are divided into three types: 100 yuan, 200 yuan, and 300 yuan. Trackless trolleys are not divided into classes, and their fares are divided into three types: 200 yuan, 300 yuan, and 400 yuan. Bus fares are divided into six types: 200 yuan, 300 yuan, 400 yuan, 500 yuan, 600 yuan, and 700 yuan. Among them, the British and French trolleybuses and the French and municipal buses have slightly different prices due to the different lengths of the routes.</p>
<p>The Route 8 buses operated by the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau will officially start running today. The starting point is the North Station, passing through Shishan Road, Tiantong'an, Weidemai Road, and ending at Wujiaochang. Route 9 buses are currently being actively prepared, and the planned route is from the New World to Damuqiao in Nanshi (the Citizens' New Village built by the Municipal Public Works Bureau), and it is expected to officially start running in early next month.</p>
<p>Due to military and police personnel riding buses without tickets, the income of public vehicles in the city has been directly affected, and the order in the carriages is also extremely chaotic. In order to rectify this situation, the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau has consulted with the Military Affairs Department and the 23rd Gendarmerie Regiment and agreed on preferential measures for military and police passengers. The companies will jointly issue 1,200 long-term free bus passes for military and police personnel, which will be distributed by the Garrison Headquarters to the 900 troops stationed in Shanghai by the Navy, Army, and Air Force. The remaining 300 passes will be distributed by the Garrison Headquarters and the Police Bureau, 150 each. These free bus passes are limited to military and police personnel on official business who are neatly dressed and wear insignia. For military and police personnel without these free bus passes, separate preferential measures will be formulated. The trolley fare will be 100 yuan per ride, regardless of distance, and the bus fare will be 200 yuan per ride, but it is also limited to those who are neatly dressed and wear insignia. These measures will also officially take effect today.</p>
<h3>"Mummy" Shanghai Lane News: Old Monk Gilds Himself After Death, Claiming it as the Result of Spiritual Practice</h3>
<p>[Special Report from Our Newspaper] This is news that is sure to spark conversation among readers. The "Mummies" of Egypt are world-famous, and the "Mummies" of the Hangzhou Museum are equally fascinating. But we never knew that Shanghai also had a "Mummy," perhaps due to superstition, its custodians have always kept it a secret. But this secret has finally been discovered.</p>
<p>As far back as four years ago, in the Tianzhen Buddhist Hall at No. 92A, Lane 500 on Yidingpan Road, there was an old monk named "Qiu Zunsong, Dharma Master." He believed that with his piety, he was qualified to "pass away peacefully" and ascend to heaven. So, four months before his death, he cut himself off from food and only sipped thin porridge, gradually not even drinking porridge, only eating fruit to satisfy his hunger. And for the hundred days before his death, he didn't even drink a drop of water.</p>
<p>One day, he seemed to have a premonition of death, and he asked his disciples to invite a barber to shave his head. Then he said, "I am going to return to heaven." He also instructed his disciples not to cremate his "physical body." Then, he asked for three watermelons, sat in the lotus position, and passed away as if he were dozing off. This was on the fourth day of the third month of the lunar calendar in the 31st year of the Republic of China [1942].</p>
<p>His disciples, following their teacher's last words, did not cremate Dharma Master Qiu Zunsong's body. Instead, they used two large earthenware jars as a coffin, covered them together, and placed them in the Buddhist hall. To prevent the body from decomposing, they placed charcoal, rosin, sandalwood, and incense sticks throughout the jars.</p>
<p>After eighty days, Qiu Zunsong's young disciple, driven by curiosity, opened the two jars. He thought that the body should have decayed beyond recognition, but to his surprise, his teacher was still sitting in the lotus position as if he were dozing off, and his skin and flesh had not come off at all. The only difference was that his skin had turned white.</p>
<p>This sight, in the eyes of the young monk, did not conjure up the new term "Mummy." What he realized was that his master had "ascended to heaven" and "become an immortal." So, he worshiped his master every day as if he were still alive.</p>
<p>During the Mid-Autumn Festival that year, this secret was suddenly discovered by a couple of pious believers, Mr. and Mrs. Ying, who were burning incense. They also believed that Qiu Zunsong's spiritual practice was worthy of worship. So, they wanted to gild this "Mummy." Naturally, the young monk did not object, and the grand ceremony of gilding was solemnly held. First, the young monk gave the body a full bath and dressed it in a summer cloth shirt. Then, he mixed flour into a paste and brushed it over the body and clothes, and finally applied the shimmering gold.</p>
<p>The gold statue that the reporter saw had a slightly drooping head, wrinkles on its forehead, exposed ribs, and closed eyes, draped in a large red shawl, sitting in the lotus position in a shrine that was glass on three sides and wood on one side. The young monk said, "His head was originally straight, supported by incense sticks under his neck, but later a child broke the incense sticks, and his head drooped down."</p>
<p>Now, the golden remains of this Dharma Master Qiu Zunsong have been regarded as a "Bodhisattva" and are worshiped with incense by pious men and women!</p>

<h3>Letter to the Editor</h3>
<p>I have found that the content of the news item "Former Haimen County Magistrate Detained in Shanghai" published in your newspaper on the 12th of this month's news column is inconsistent with the facts. I, the undersigned, served as the Haimen Magistrate for ten months, enduring the perilous situation surrounded by bandits and puppets, fulfilling my duties with integrity, upholding the law, and rectifying corruption to the best of my ability. Recently, I was transferred to the provincial government for inspection, and at the beginning of the month, I handed over my duties and passed through Shanghai on my way to the province. Suddenly, I was falsely accused by malicious people and secretly reported to the garrison, resulting in a misunderstanding and surveillance. Now, after investigation, it has been confirmed that the accusations are false, and the provincial government has sent personnel to Shanghai to negotiate, proving that the fact of my employment in the provincial government is irrefutable. The report that I was carrying weapons is indeed true, but all of them are registered public and private firearms, and the guards accompanying me are local troops dispatched for escort due to the insecurity of the waterways. In addition to filing a lawsuit against the accusers and publishing a statement in the newspaper, I am sincerely afraid that the outside world will not understand the truth, so I specially request that you make a correction to clarify the truth and rectify public opinion. Respectfully, Liu Daoping.</p>
<h3>Social Services - Reader Consultations</h3>
<p>Legal Questions</p>
<p>(1) Divorce and Remarriage</p>
<p>Shen Wenhua asks: A friend, Mr. A, whose wife, Ms. B, is in love with two men and has filed for divorce from A. A agrees and is willing to make a written agreement stipulating that if B marries C, the agreement will be invalid. Can this agreement be established in law?</p>
<p>[Answer from Lawyer Fu Kuangling] B asked A for a divorce because she is in love with C, so after the divorce, there is no reason not to marry C. If taking not marrying two men as a condition for divorce, then this condition is equal to a mere formality. B and C can live together temporarily without getting married, and then get married later when the time is right. In fact, it is difficult to force them to fulfill the conditions attached to the divorce agreement. The law has no explicit prohibition, except that those who are divorced or declared adulterous after being judged for adultery may not marry the adulterer.</p>
<p>(2) Difficult to Grow Old Together</p>
<p>Wang Nongyin asks: Your relative, Mr. Xu, married Ms. Wu from the same village in the 30th year of the Republic of China [1941] through a matchmaker. At first, they were safe and sound, but then they had disagreements due to incompatibility and often had disputes. Ms. Wu felt that it would be difficult to grow old together in the long run, so she painfully divorced Ms. Wu. However, the procedures in the countryside are mostly inconsistent with the law. Now there are questions: (1) If both men and women are willing to divorce unconditionally, will a lawyer's signature and certification be legally valid? Does the woman's parents have the right to interfere? (2) If Mr. Xu draws up a divorce certificate and Ms. Wu signs it, is it valid? (Ms. Wu is illiterate.) (3) If Ms. Wu leaves without saying goodbye, and Mr. Xu publishes a warning in the newspaper, treating it as a permanent separation of the marital relationship, is it legally valid?</p>
<p>[Answer from Lawyer Fu Kuangling] (1) If a husband and wife divorce by mutual consent and a lawyer makes a certification, it is naturally valid in law, but it must be certified by two or more people. If both men and women are of age (20 years old is of age), the parents have no right to interfere; (2) It is appropriate to handle it in accordance with the methods described in the first paragraph of the above; (3) If the wife leaves without saying goodbye, it is malicious abandonment of her husband, which constitutes grounds for divorce. In order to avoid future disputes, a warning should first be published in the newspaper, setting a time limit for her to return home. If she does not return after the deadline, apply to the court for divorce.</p>
<h3>Overview of the Emergency Medical Loan Society in the First Half of the Month</h3>
<p>In the first half of November, the Shanghai Citizens' Emergency Medical Loan Society received applications for loans from 80 patients. A total of 24 patients were discharged from the hospital and settled their accounts. Among them, 2 died, and the remaining were cured and discharged. The total amount of loans issued was 10,059,450 yuan. The remaining 56 people are still in the hospital for treatment, and the estimated outstanding loans will be 30 million yuan. The society recently received 1,160,000 yuan donated from Yuan Gong Jing Qi's ninetieth birthday celebration, and it is recalled that sick families have repaid loans totaling 300,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Atrocities Forgotten in Leniency; Executioners are About to Return Home</h3>
<p>Why are so few war criminals being tried? Why can't they be punished as they deserve?</p>
<p>Were the rapes, murders, and arson all illusions?</p>
<p>[Special Report from Our Newspaper] Time often fades people's memories. Today, it has been just over a year since the end of the War of Resistance Against Japan, and everyone seems to have gradually forgotten the various atrocities and abuse suffered at the hands of the enemy during the eight years. At least it can be said that they are no longer very enthusiastic about how to punish those war criminals who were once ferocious executioners. Although the government has set up several institutions to manage and try war criminals, the only results in the past year, apart from some intermittent news in the newspapers, are the execution of Sakai Takashi in Nanjing and the death sentence of Shimoda Jiro, known as the "Tiger of Jiangyin," in Shanghai (but it still cannot be executed to this day). And the more than 1,000 suspected war criminals concentrated near Jiangwan to undergo "reform" for more than a year are said to be sent back to their country before the end of the year.</p>
<p>Perhaps some people suspect that among so many suspects, why are there so few real war criminals? Are the countless crimes that countless people have personally experienced and witnessed in the past all illusions and unfounded rumors? I remember that the last time a comrade in distress identified the enemy's constitution, the wife of a martyred martyr said very angrily to the manager: "Don't let them go back, shoot them all with machine guns!" This wife's idea is certainly too naive, but it can enlighten us that there are indeed many compatriots who still have grievances that have not been redressed among the people. Therefore, some people cannot help but ask: Why can't war criminals be punished as they deserve as soon as possible?</p>
<p>The Difficulty Lies in the Lack of Evidence</p>
<p>According to the authorities in charge, the greatest difficulty lies in the lack of "evidence." Because now the international community talks about "civilization," unlike the wild era before, the victorious side can kill the captured enemies as much as they want, and we must maintain the demeanor of a great power. Even though the enemy did not treat us with morality at the beginning, now we must treat the enemy with fairness. To be fair, of course, everything must be based on the position of the law; to be based on the position of the law, everything must have evidence. Since we cannot use their own methods to treat them and "torture them to extract confessions," we can only watch them escape!</p>
<p>Victims are Afraid and Cowardly</p>
<p>So what are the difficulties in collecting evidence? In addition to some clues that do not leave any traces at all and cannot be found, the cowardice and fear of the Chinese people often make the judges who are in charge of the interrogation both cry and laugh. Many victims have this idea: the matter has passed, let it go! Why bother to find trouble again! It is really rare to have enthusiastic people like Lin Chao, the manager of the New Asia Electric Factory, who was motivated by righteous indignation and willing to assist the court to collect evidence of Shiba Genpei's rape of women in Ningbo. According to what the reporter heard, there was once a witness who refused to testify. He even said: "If I testify in court, I don't know if I can convict him based on what I say. If the Japanese regain power in the future, I will suffer again." This kind of cowardly psychology of the quasi-conqueror is of course regrettable, but in contrast to the chaotic situation in the country in the past year and the increasingly prosperous Japanese situation, it is indeed inevitable to be vigilant.</p>
<p>The Responsible Authorities Have Many Restraints</p>
<p>In addition, various travel expenses and so on make it difficult to hope that they will be willing to come to court to testify voluntarily, and the responsible authorities themselves have been slow to carry out their work due to the lack of funds and personnel restraints. For example, the management agency has adopted a lenient and appeasement policy due to the weakness of the guard force; the trial agency has been halted for several months due to the replacement of the presiding judge; and the lack of funds and vehicles has made investigation and interrogation difficult.</p>
<p>One person in charge said it well: "We have been imprisoning them for more than a year, but we cannot produce evidence. It is embarrassing to continue imprisoning them, so we have to let them go back." Although it is said that if evidence of guilt is found in the future, they can still be brought to China, but this is probably just talk. All we can hope for now is that those war criminals who are already imprisoned in the Tilanqiao Prison will be punished as they deserve as soon as possible!</p>

<p>This office that manages another world, in addition to being filled with incense, has become a lively market…</p>
<h3>A Brief History of the Shanghai City God Temple [Special Report from Our Newspaper]</h3>
<p>The Shanghai City God Temple, which has a history of more than 500 years, is a place that every traveler who comes to Shanghai for the first time must visit. This office that manages another world, in addition to being filled with incense, has become a lively market, comparable to the Confucius Temple in Nanjing and the Xuanmiao Temple in Suzhou.</p>
<p>The earliest City God Temple in Shanghai was already established in the Song Dynasty, but it was not in its current location. At that time, Shanghai was only a town, and there was no City God Temple. There was only the City God Temple of Huating County, which was enshrined in the Danjing Temple. Therefore, the Danjing Temple was also called the Xingdian of the Huating City God Temple. In the 29th year of Zhiyuan in the Yuan Dynasty (1290 AD), Shanghai was made a county, and the City God Temple was established, but it was still enshrined in the Danjing Temple.</p>
<p>The current City God Temple inside the New North Gate was rebuilt from the Jinshan Temple by Magistrate Zhang Shouyue during the Yongle period of the Ming Dynasty—between 1403 and 1424 AD. The Jinshan Temple, also known as the Huo Guang Xingci, was dedicated to Huo Guang, the Marquis of Bolu of the Han Dynasty. According to the "Wu Yue Bei Shi," it was built at the end of the Three Kingdoms by Sun Hao, the King of Wu. When it was changed to the City God Temple, it still enshrined Huo Guang concurrently, so there has always been a saying that "Huo is in the front temple, and Qin is in the rear hall." (Qin refers to the City God Qin Yubo.)</p>
<p>Having Endured Many Changes in Five Hundred Years</p>
<p>At the beginning of the reconstruction of the City God Temple, it was not as large as it is today. It has encountered many disasters in more than 500 years. The red walls, purple tiles, and clay sculptures have endured many changes. Each time it was damaged, it was expanded during repairs, and it gradually became the current situation. The first repair was during the Tianshun period of the Ming Dynasty (1457-1464), when Magistrate Li Wen built a pavilion in front of the temple and inscribed the imperial edict on stone. In the 14th year of Jiajing (1535), because the temple gate was too small, the temple managers raised money to build a memorial archway. At that time, the newly appointed Magistrate of Shanghai, Feng Bin, inscribed the four characters "Haiyu Baozhang," which were written by a prodigy from Yongjia. (See Wanli Shanghai County Records.)</p>
<p>In the 30th year of Wanli (1602), Magistrate Liu Yikuan rebuilt it again, but it was destroyed by fire in just four years. In the 34th year, it was rebuilt by Magistrate Li Jizhou. At the beginning of the Chongzhen period of the Ming Dynasty, a theater stage was built on the Yimen, and a bedroom was added behind the temple.</p>
<p>By the 22nd year of Kangxi in the Qing Dynasty (1683), Magistrate Shi Cai donated his salary to advocate repairs. The Taoist priests of the Zhenjun Temple raised funds to build two drum pavilions (see Kangxi Shanghai County Records). In the 48th year of Kangxi (1710), local people built the East Garden in the east of the temple, and the City God Temple became a famous scenic spot in the city. In the 13th year of Yongzheng (1735), the abbot of the temple raised funds for repairs. In the 13th year of Qianlong (1748), the bedroom was destroyed by fire and was rebuilt by Magistrate Wang Ting.</p>
<p>Mid-Qianlong Period - Shops Densely Packed</p>
<p>From the reconstruction of the Jinshan Temple until then, the temple base covered an area of 12 mu and 6 fen, which was not very large. It was not until the mid-Qianlong period that the Yuyuan Garden was purchased as the West Garden of the City God Temple. The land was divided and repaired, and it was expanded to 36 mu and 8 fen and 9 li and 2 hao. And tourists gradually saw that the temple base was expanded to 36 due to the increase in guilds, and it eventually became densely packed with shops.</p>
<h3>Disasters and Difficulties in the Past Two Hundred Years - Eight Robberies</h3>
<p>In the past two hundred years, the City God Temple has really been "full of disasters and difficulties." It has suffered five fires and three military robberies. After the first fire in the 13th year of Qianlong, it was repaired many times. In the 59th year of Qianlong (1794), Ge Wenying raised funds to build the back building. In the 3rd year of Jiaqing (1798), the main hall was renovated again, and twenty-four divisions were arranged in two rows, with four division halls outside the Yimen and to the west of the hall. In the 16th year of Daoguang (1836), it suffered a second fire robbery, and the west wing and the theater stage were burned down. Later, it was rebuilt with funds raised by merchants.</p>
<p>From the 22nd year of Daoguang to the 10th year of Xianfeng (1842-1860 AD), China was in turmoil due to internal strife and foreign aggression, and the City God Temple also suffered unprecedented misfortune. It encountered three military robberies. The first time was on the 11th day of the fifth month of the 22nd year of Daoguang, when it was occupied by British sailors for five days as a temporary garrison. The second time was in the 3rd year of Xianfeng, when Lin Afu and Liu Lichuan, the leaders of the Small Swords Society, led their troops to occupy Shanghai. The City God Temple was occupied as their headquarters for one year and six months. The third time was in the 10th year of Xianfeng, when the Taiping Army approached, Wu Xu, the Su-Song-Tai Taoist Priest, invited British and French troops to enter the city to defend it, and the City God Temple was changed into a British and French barracks. The blue-eyed devils destroyed the garden scenery and suffered considerable losses. In the 4th year of Tongzhi (1865), Magistrate Wang Zonglian and others rebuilt it, spending more than 18,000 strings of money, and it took nine months to restore the City God Temple to its former glory. In the 19th year of Guangxu (1893), Magistrate Huang Chengxuan raised funds to build the front gate, the second gate, the yuan gate, the main hall, the theater stage, and the drum pavilion. The Yunyun Board of Directors of the Cao Board of Transport hung a plaque with the inscription "Bao Li Cang Chi."</p>
<p>At that time, there were more and more tourists and shops in the temple. Various industries saw that there was profit to be made, and they rented out the remaining land to build houses and set up shops, until there was almost no vacant land in the garden. Therefore, in the 24th year of Guangxu, Magistrate Huang Chengxuan issued an announcement: "It is permanently forbidden to build houses on vacant land, which would damage the garden." In the 1st year of Xuantong (1909), Magistrate Li Chaoqiong raised funds to repair the walls and the main hall and bedroom.</p>
<p>Three Fires After the Republic of China</p>
<p>After the Republic of China, it suffered three fires. On the eighth day of the tenth lunar month of the 11th year of the Republic of China, there was a fire, and the local public fund property office repaired it. On July 15th of the 13th year, the main hall caught fire and was burned down, and the tuosha statue of the Jinshan City God was also robbed. On November 26th of the same year, a corner of the east building was burned down, affecting the halls and pavilions. Later, the Yimiao Board of Directors, together with Du Yuesheng, Huang Jinrong, and Zhang Xiaolin, donated funds to rebuild it, spending 50,000 silver yuan. Construction started in April of the 15th year of the Republic of China and was completed in November of the following year. A steel and concrete building was built. On the 25th of the same month, the Yimiao Board of Directors displayed rare delicacies and followed ancient rituals to offer sacrifices and hold an opening ceremony. On that day, pious men and women came to the temple to visit in an endless stream.</p>
<p>New City God Temple - Dusk</p>
<p>In the 26th year of the Republic of China, the War of Resistance Against Japan broke out, and the South City was captured by the enemy. The city was also ravaged, and refugees gathered in one corner. At that time, Father Rao rose up and set up a refugee area. The houses in the area were preserved, and the City God Temple was located within it. However, because the enemy cavalry was everywhere, it was difficult to enter and exit. Therefore, those who relied on the "Old Master" for food put their minds to work and built the "New City God Temple" on Luzon Road. The shops were lined up, and life was thriving. And this "Xibei" Old Master, relying on the shelter of the "Concession," also attracted the incense offerings of pious men and women. After the victory, the original site of the South City had mostly returned to its former appearance, and the "fallen Old Master" had long been included in the repatriation list, and the incense was revived. The New City God Temple on Luzon Road is already "dusk," and its fate will not be long.</p>

<h3>Different Views in the Eyes of Foreigners</h3>
<p>The Spanish writer Ibáñez, in his posthumous work "A Novelist's Journey Around the World," expressed his heartfelt praise for the Shanghai City God Temple, especially for the Huxin Pavilion and the Jiuqu Bridge in the City God Temple. He also praised the "Old Master's Garden," saying that the Chinese regarded the buildings as the Egyptian pyramids and the White House in Washington were regarded in the minds of Westerners.</p>
<p>The impression of the former French consul Mei Peng of the City God Temple was that the streets were so noisy and disturbing that they made noise to attract good gods and also made noise to drive away evil gods.</p>
<p>So he arbitrarily came to a conclusion:</p>
<p>"The Chinese do not like quietness, and even seem to be afraid of quietness."</p>
<p>A reporter from the North China Daily News wrote an explanation on the photos of the Huxin Pavilion. He didn't say much, just said:</p>
<p>"Tourists who go to the teahouse like to prepare two copper coins of pastries for themselves and throw them to the fish and turtles in the pool to eat."</p>
<p>The former Anglican Church pastor Da Wend, who had traveled all over Shanghai, expressed the following thoughts:</p>
<p>"We ran into the City God Temple… In the afternoon, this courtyard is a market, and people think of the merchants in the ancient Temple of Jerusalem. There are snack shops, toy shops, incense shops, and tricksters here."</p>
<h3>Records of the City God Temple's Annual Events</h3>
<p>Before Shanghai was opened as a commercial port, the City God Temple was the only place of entertainment for the entire city. Therefore, there were many grand events throughout the year. Although most of these have now become historical relics, in order to preserve local customs and research materials, I will record, to the best of my knowledge, the following detailed account:</p>
<p>New Year:  The inner garden and Cui Xiu Tang (Gathering of Elegance Hall) of the City God Temple were customarily open twice a month on the first and fifteenth days of the lunar calendar for people to visit. Only during the first ten days of the New Year were the doors open all day, and ladies and gentlemen came and went in droves, making the roads crowded. The first day of the New Year was especially congested.</p>
<p>Plum Blossom Exhibition:  Every year on the third day of the first lunar month, the inner temple would open a plum blossom exhibition for visitors to enjoy.</p>
<p>Lantern Festival:  On the night of the fifteenth day of the first lunar month, the temple was ablaze with lights and decorations, and the sounds of music were like boiling water. The ban on night travel was lifted, and crowds of visitors gathered. A few days before the Lantern Festival, there was also a "lantern market" where vendors gathered near the temple to sell colorful lanterns.</p>
<p>City God's Birthday:  Tradition says that the City God's birthday is on the twenty-first day of the second lunar month. Taoist priests would set up altars to chant scriptures, and the "subordinates" of the "Old Master" would come to pay respects and offer birthday wishes.</p>
<p>City God's Wife's Birthday:  On the twenty-eighth day of the third lunar month, the temple was decorated with lanterns and colorful streamers. Many ladies came to watch, and the spectacle was often far grander than the "Old Master's" birthday.</p>
<p>Three Patrols:  The City God customarily went on patrol three times a year to "aid and relieve lonely souls." The dates were the day before Qingming Festival, the fifteenth day of the seventh lunar month (Mid-Autumn Festival), and the first day of the tenth lunar month. When the City God went on patrol, he would be accompanied by his staff: the Four Departments of "New River," "Tall Man," "Gaochang," and "Wealth," with ceremonial guards leading the way. Citizens would hold incense and flowers to follow. There were also often courtesans, heavily made up and dressed in gorgeous clothes, wearing... or sitting in open palanquins, pretending to be "female prisoners." This inevitably attracted frivolous young men, who flocked to them as if startled.</p>
<p>During the Tongzhi reign, Magistrate Ye Tingchun issued a strict prohibition.</p>
<p>Start of Summer:  According to old customs, new wheat had to be offered as a sacrifice. The Orchid Exhibition was held every year in the late fourth lunar month in the West Garden. The exhibition lasted for three days and was open to the public. All kinds of fine orchids were displayed, competing for beauty. The one that was ranked first was hailed as the "Top Scholar."</p>
<p>Heaven's Gift Festival:  On the sixth day of the sixth lunar month, tailors from all over the city held a "robe-drying festival" at the City God Temple.</p>
<p>Chrysanthemum Exhibition:  Held in mid-September, but not every year, the exhibition featured chrysanthemums that were judged and ranked according to "novelty," "nobility," and "rarity." The names of the chrysanthemum owners were labeled on the pots. The first chrysanthemum exhibition was held at the Four Beauties Pavilion.</p>
<h3>The City God Temple After Restoration: One Side Says "A Spirit Omen Costs 500 Yuan," the Other Says "Beware of Pickpockets"</h3>
<p>[Special Report by Our Newspaper]  The weather is cold, but the City God Temple is still as lively as ever. This City God, who has returned after being restored to his position, is receiving the worship of his devout followers amidst swirling incense smoke. On the large pillars on either side, one side says "A Spirit Omen Costs 500 Yuan," while the other says "Beware of Pickpockets."</p>
<p>However, the number of people who come to the City God Temple to burn incense and pray is far less than the number of people who come to stroll around for leisure. The temple's religious significance has been overshadowed by the atmosphere of a commercial market. As soon as you enter the gate, there are all kinds of stalls selling daily necessities such as towels, mirrors, and tea cups, as well as stalls selling squid ribs and fermented rice cakes. There are also philosophers who offer fortune-telling services. However, business is very slow. People seem to come here just to stroll around and don't really want to buy anything.</p>
<p>The Nine-Bend Bridge is also packed with people, just like Nanjing Road. The people in front block your way, and the people behind push you forward. If you randomly grab someone and ask what they are doing squeezing around in this cold weather, they won't think you're crazy, but they won't pay attention to you either. There are many people in Shanghai who spend their lives squeezing around in crowds.  At the corners of the bridge, there are also some small stalls. These stalls are different from the stalls inside the temple. They are a world of American goods: selling military food boxes, glass belts, and "American brushes."</p>
<p>The water in the pond under the bridge is murky, with scraps of paper, chestnut shells, and all kinds of waste floating on the surface. Yet, some people lean on the railing and stare blankly at it, wondering if they really want to discover some miracle or find a swimming fish?</p>
<p>After crossing the bridge, it is still crowded with people and stores one after another. The people in the stores put their hands in their sleeves, lean on the counters, and watch the people squeezing around. Among these people squeezing around, there are also those who stop and look at the goods on the shelves in the store. But after looking for a while, they squeeze past again.</p>
<p>Turning the corner, you reach the World United Commercial Center. Stepping up the stairs, there are even more people. In this room where the air is so foul that it is unbearable, people squeeze together with great interest, and you can often hear people shouting, "Squeeze! Squeeze!"</p>
<p>The reporter also squeezed in and squeezed out like this.</p>
<h3>A Discussion on the City God Temple Gardens: In the Blink of an Eye, They Have Become Relics of the Past</h3>
<p>East Garden</p>
<p>"North of the temple, a famous garden is opened, east of the shrine, separate halls are built,</p>
<p>Even more, I plan to climb high and gaze at the clouds, a small altar on earth built by carriages."</p>
<p>This is a poem written by Cao Yishi, a Jinshi (successful candidate in the imperial examination) from this county, for the Small Spirit Terrace in the East Garden of the City God Temple. The East Garden is also known as the Inner Garden and was built during the Kangxi period. Later, due to the expenses incurred by the money industry for renovations, the guildhall was established here. After the opening of the concession, the money industry in the northern part of the city flourished, and all public affairs related to the northern and southern parts of the city were discussed here. Later, the money industry guildhall was established in the southern part of the city, and the money industry guildhall was also established in the northern part of the city, making this the main guildhall.</p>
<p>Although the garden's foundation is not very large, it seems that considerable effort was spent on its construction at that time. The Tongzhi gazetteer states: "The ponds, trees, and rocks are all ancient and elegant, truly a scenic spot. The winding railings, long corridors, flowers, and trees are all secluded and deep in the garden. The best part is the Small Spirit Terrace." According to Cao Yishi's preface, "The terrace is over ten zhang (about 33 meters) high and only wide enough for banquets, and the east, south, and north sides of the Huangpu River are all visible." This shows that the terrace was quite high at the time, enough to climb and overlook the surrounding area. According to the Shanghai County Gazetteer of the Qianlong period, "The terrace was originally in the eastern corner of the East Garden, but it is now abandoned." The larger one was rebuilt around the Jiaqing period and was located in the southwest corner of the garden, only a few zhang high.</p>
<p>The West Garden's Predecessor: The Old Site of Yu Garden</p>
<p>The West Garden was originally the old site of the Pan family's Yu Garden. It was built during the Jiajing period of the Ming Dynasty by Pan Yunduan, a native of this county who was serving as the Sichuan Provincial Administration Commissioner. His intention was to serve his father, Pan En, and provide a place for him to enjoy his old age. The garden covered several tens of acres and was built over twenty years, using the entire family's wealth. The scenic spots in the garden at that time included:</p>
<p>Yuhua Hall (Jade Splendor Hall), Huijing Hall (Gathering of Scenes Hall), Rongyu Hall (Hall of Leisure), Zuiyue Tower (Drunken Moon Tower), Yixiu Pavilion (Catching Elegance Pavilion), Yule Xuan (Fish Joy Pavilion), Leshou Hall (Joyful Longevity Hall), Liuying Pavilion (Retaining Shadows Pavilion), Hanbi Pavilion (Embracing Jade Pavilion), Zhengyang Tower (Upright Sun Tower), Yuyin Pavilion (Jade Shade Pavilion), Yiwan Tower (Comforting Evening Tower), Liuchun Cottage (Retaining Spring Cottage), Fuyi Pavilion (Duck Leisure Pavilion), etc.</p>
<p>In addition, there were family shrines and various other shrines. Ponds were dug, rocks were piled to form mountains, and ponds and rocks were scattered throughout the garden. The land had the beauty of ravines, ridges, and caves, while the water had the charm of islands, beaches, bridges, and ferries. Famous flowers and precious trees were planted, and winding beams and pavilion paths were arranged. Climbing the mountain made it easy to overlook the surroundings, and boating was enough to tour around. In addition, there were family shrines built in the garden. At the entrance, the Pan family inscribed the words "Human Realm, Pot Heaven." West of the entrance, on the high wall, were inscribed the words "Embrace the Universe." Pan's pride can be imagined.</p>
<p>Cycles of Prosperity and Decline: Good Times Do Not Last</p>
<p>However, gardens in the world cannot escape the cycles of prosperity and decline. Good times do not last. By the time of Pan's descendants, the family fortune had gradually declined, and Yu Garden was neglected and eventually ownerless. It was purchased at a low price by the people of the county and incorporated into the City God Temple. At that time, during the Qianlong period of the Qing Dynasty, the East Garden already existed east of the temple, so it was called the West Garden. It was rebuilt over twenty years at a cost of tens of thousands of taels of silver. The original garden base was said to be over seventy acres, but according to the Qing Dynasty land survey in the seventh year of Tongzhi, it was only thirty-six acres, eight fen, nine li, and two hao. Although rocks were still piled up and ponds were dug, and flowers and bamboo were planted, most of the exquisite buildings were used as guildhalls for various industries. The reason for this was as follows: The West Garden was a public building, and it could not be managed without someone in charge. However, if a special management organization was established, the annual expenses, especially the land taxes, would pose a major problem. Therefore, at that time, various industries used a "semi-borrowing" method, designating a portion of the garden as their guildhall while also being responsible for paying taxes and repairing the buildings. The scenery of the West Garden at that time was completely different from the Yu Garden era. If you read through the sections recorded in Qiao Zhongwu's "Record of the West Garden" and Yu Ziquan's "Ying Xuan Magazine," the old scenery of the West Garden would seem to be before your eyes.</p>
<p>Later, the Chaoran Terrace (Transcendent Terrace), Huijiong Tower (Returning Echo Tower), Dianchun Hall (Touching Spring Hall), and Five Old Peaks were added, and Wanghua Hall (Viewing Flowers Hall) was renamed Xiangxue Hall (Fragrant Snow Hall), and Wanhua Deep Place (Ten Thousand Flower Deep Place) was renamed Wanhua Tower (Ten Thousand Flower Tower). As a result, there were more scenic spots and endless streams of visitors.</p>
<p>Two Disasters of War: The Lakes and Mountains Were All Destroyed</p>
<p>In the twenty-second year of Daoguang (1842 AD), British warships occupied Wusong and were stationed at the City God Temple. The red lotuses planted at the Nine-Bend Bridge were the first to be plundered. In the third year of Xianfeng, the Small Swords Society uprising occurred, and the garden's precious pavilions became the nests of the rebels. When the Qing troops entered the city, the West Garden was destroyed by fire. Xiangxue Hall became a field of rubble, and Lotus Flower Hall, Deyue Tower (Gaining Moon Tower), Flower God Pavilion, and others were also turned to ashes. Only the strange rocks such as the Five Old Peaks and Jade Linglong still stood tall, the pond remained intact, and the green water was still there, vaguely recognizable as the old scale. In the tenth year of Xianfeng (1860), the Taiping Army entered the territory, and British and French troops entered the city to help defend it. The West Garden was used as a military camp, and as a result, the artificial mountains suffered, and the lakes and mountains were all destroyed. After the peace, although Circuit Intendant Ding Richang negotiated their withdrawal, the West Garden had already been trampled and destroyed beyond recognition!</p>
<p>In the fourth year of Tongzhi (1865), it was rebuilt, and it was焕然一新 once again. However, because it was starting from scratch, its scenery was very different from the old West Garden. Only the Jade Linglong stone in front of Xiangxue Hall is still a relic of Yu Garden. Legend has it that this stone was a relic of the flower and stone network during the reign of Emperor Huizong of the Song Dynasty. When it was being transported across the Huangpu River, a strong wind suddenly arose, and the stone and the boat sank into the water. Later, a giant rope was used to drag it up from the water, and that is this Jade Linglong stone. The top of the stone has the two characters "Yuhua" (Jade Splendor). The "Yuhua Hall" built by Pan Yunbo, the owner of Yu Garden, was named after this. In addition, there is the Kuixing stone (Star of Literature Stone) by the Nine Lions Pavilion. It is a relic of the West Garden from the Qianlong period. "Records of the Country of Swamps" says, "It was originally an object of Wang's Su Garden." It originally had the shapes of the Great Scholar, Kuixing, Hanshan, and Shide, five towering stones, hence the name Five Old Peaks, but only one remains today. The remaining buildings were all added after the war.</p>
<p>From the rise and fall of the gardens, we can also roughly see the signs of governance and chaos in Shanghai over the past three hundred years.</p>
<h3>Shanghai's City God, Qin Yubo, Is 650 Years Old This Year</h3>
<p>It is said that the City God of this city is Qin Yubo, a waiting official of the Ming Dynasty. These two words "It is said" are based on the "Ode to the City God of Shanghai County" in the "Four Yanzhai Wenji" written by Cao Yishi of the Qing Dynasty, and the "Hu Cheng Beikao" written by Chu Wenzhou. They all unanimously said it was "Lord Qin Yubo", but it is difficult to find accurate evidence, so this "It is said" has been handed down to the present.</p>
<p>Qin Yubo, courtesy name Weirao, also Jingrong, alias Kuizhai, was the seventh-generation grandson of Qin Shaoyou, a scholar of the Longtu Pavilion in the Song Dynasty. His great-grandfather was Tianyou, and his paternal grandfather was Zhirou. Their ancestral home was Gaoyou County, Yangzhou Prefecture. Due to the chaos of the war at the end of the Song Dynasty, his grandfather moved to Shanghai. His father was named Lianghao, alias Shuzhai, and his mother was Tang. Qin Yubo was born on June 12th of the second year of Yuanzhen (July 25, 1295 AD). Calculating it, this year is exactly 650 years old.</p>
<p>Qin's childhood</p>
<p>He followed his father to Daming, registered in Daming and studied in the Imperial College. At the age of forty-nine (the fourth year of Zhizheng in the Yuan Dynasty, 1344 AD), he passed the imperial examination. He then served as the registrar of the Huguang Provincial Administration, and in the tenth year of Zhizheng (1350 AD), he was promoted to Magistrate of Gaomi County, Shandong Province. Two years later, he was promoted to Assistant Minister of the Fujian Provincial Administration. At the end of the Yuan Dynasty, the world was in chaos. He abandoned his official position and lived in Yangzhou, and soon moved to Shanghai. At that time, Zhang Shicheng occupied Suzhou. Hearing of Qin's virtue, he sent people to invite him to take office, but he did not go. In the twenty-fifth year of Zhizheng (1365 AD), his mother, Tang, passed away. He observed mourning at home. When Emperor Taizu of the Ming Dynasty rose up to quell the chaos, he ordered the Central Secretariat to summon him. However, Qin was stubborn by nature and had no interest in fame and fortune in his later years. He instructed his younger brother, Hengbo, to write a letter of refusal, saying:</p>
<p>"I have received the Yuan Emperor's salary and title for more than ten years. To betray him and rise up now is disloyal; I am in mourning for my mother and have not yet completed the mourning period. To forget my grief and go out is unfilial."</p>
<p>In the first year of Hongwu in the Ming Dynasty (1368 AD), Emperor Taizu again sent someone to invite him, but Qin still claimed illness and refused to come out. As a result, Emperor Taizu issued a personal edict, saying: "The people of the coastal areas are fond of fighting. Yubo is a man of wisdom and strategy. Now that the world has been settled, he is living in seclusion and refusing to come out. What does he intend to do!" Qin had no choice but to pay his respects and enter the court. However, he firmly refused to take office. On July 20th of the sixth year of Hongwu (August 8, 1373 AD), he passed away in Shanghai at the age of seventy-eight.</p>
<p>From the above deeds, it can be seen that: (1) Qin's ancestral home was Gaoyou, not a native of Shanghai. (2) Qin had "received the Yuan Emperor's salary and title for more than ten years," so he was unwilling to "betray him and rise up" to take office under the Ming Dynasty.</p>
<p>A Confused Record of Famine Relief</p>
<p>As for how Mr. Qin Yubo became the City God of Shanghai County, it is very vague. According to Qin Wenyi, a descendant of Qin Yubo, in the sixth year of Tongzhi (1867), he wrote an "Explanation of the City God of Shanghai County," in which he stated that Qin Yubo died in the sixth year of Hongwu. When this was reported to the court, Emperor Taizu was shocked and saddened, saying: "He would not be my subject in life, but he should defend my land in death. Let him be posthumously enfeoffed as the City God of Shanghai County." He also said many words of praise, and finally said that Qin Yubo becoming the City God of Shanghai was only right.</p>
<p>However, there is no accurate evidence. More reliable is Cao Yishi's "Ode to the City God of Shanghai County," which says: "...The decree of ennoblement as the Earl of Xianyou was made in the first month of the second year of Hongwu. (Note: Emperor Taizu of the Ming Dynasty enfeoffed the City Gods of the capital and the world in the second year of Hongwu. Each prefecture was enfeoffed as a Marquis, and each county was enfeoffed as an Earl.) And Qin became a waiting official from the beginning of this year..."</p>
<p>The problem is here: Qin Yubo's enfeoffment as the City God of Shanghai County was in the second year of Hongwu, but Qin Yubo died in the sixth year of Hongwu. How can someone be enfeoffed as the "City God" before they die? The records of the "Di Cheng Beikao" also say:</p>
<p>"According to research, Qin Yubo was first appointed as a waiting official in the second year of Hongwu...Then who else was in charge before this? The Song Dynasty originally established the City God Temple at Danjing Temple. Did the gods of the Song and Yuan Dynasties replace it after Qin became a god? All of these are incomprehensible."</p>
<p>Therefore, Qin Yubo's position as the City God of Shanghai had become a matter of doubt in the early Qing Dynasty. Moreover, since Qin did not want to be an official of the Ming Dynasty during his lifetime, he probably would not have wanted to be enfeoffed by the Ming Dynasty after his death! However, these are all irrelevant details, just as Qin Wenyi said in his article: "Are all the City Gods in the world like this, and are you only doubting Qin?"</p>
<p>Thus, for more than five hundred years, it has always been "The Qin Family's World."</p>
<h3>Let's Speak of It Casually, Let's Listen to It Casually: Remnants of the Old Dynasty Talk of Spiritual Manifestations</h3>
<p>In the legends of the Qing Dynasty, this City God was highly worshiped by ordinary men and women. Even now, you can often hear white-haired remnants of the old dynasty, with their dry tobacco pipes, tirelessly telling young people stories of the "City God's" spiritual manifestations. It is said that in the autumn of the tenth year of Shunzhi, pirates invaded the territory. Wang Jing, the general of Suzhou, failed in his command and was attacked by the people. Just as Governor Zhou Guozhu led troops to Shanghai, Wang Jing was deeply afraid that the people would reveal his failure to flee at the sight of the enemy. He deliberately slandered the people of Shanghai in front of the governor, saying that they were all colluding with the bandits. The governor believed him and agreed to massacre all the residents from Punan to Jing'an Temple. They were prepared to start the next day, but that night, Governor Zhou had a dream. He dreamt that the City God, "wearing a red robe and holding a jade tablet, stood solemnly under the steps, repeatedly shaking his head directly." The next day, Governor Zhou canceled the previous order, and the residents of Shanghai were able to preserve themselves.</p>
<p>Such myths are recorded in great detail in Chu Wenzhou's "Hu Cheng Beikao". For example, during the Kangxi period, a cloth merchant lost money and the City God recovered it through a dream. On another occasion, the grandson of Magistrate Fu was killed by bandits, and the City God also solved the case through a dream. During the Taiping Rebellion, the City God "protected the territory and secured the people" and often "manifested his power," which those who spoke of it made it sound like "documented evidence."</p>
<p>Regardless of how absurd and ridiculous these myths are, after tea and dinner, everyone still uses them as topics of conversation.</p>
<p>The small world of the City God Temple is now also affected by the "trend of the times". The "American-equipped" "World United Commercial Center" has taken away the old-fashioned and antique old toys of the past. (Photo by this newspaper)</p>

<p>Applications for import licenses should be made before completing the procedures for ordering goods from abroad. All major items concerning the goods to be purchased should be filled in on the application form.</p>
<p>D. The importers mentioned in items A and B of this article also include manufacturers if quotas are directly allocated to them.</p>

<p>B. For goods imported by various government ministries and commissions for public needs or the needs of the agencies themselves, import licenses shall also be applied for. The import application must first be approved by the Executive Yuan. The application approved by the Executive Yuan shall have the same effect as an order from the Executive Yuan. Upon receiving the application approved by the Executive Yuan (attached with a detailed list of goods ordered, estimated shipping date, transportation method, and the amount of foreign exchange required), the Provisional Import Control Committee shall immediately issue it to the Import Management Office for the issuance of the import license. The procedures for reviewing this import license application shall be approved by the Executive Yuan.</p>
<p>C. The Provisional Import Control Committee may issue general licenses for the following imported goods:</p>
<p>1. Relief and rehabilitation supplies imported by the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration.</p>

This provision does not apply to goods listed in Schedule (4).</p>

<h3>World Student Day Commemoration Held at City Gymnasium Yesterday Morning; 24 Countries' Students Enthusiastically Participated; Beiping Rally Paid Tribute to Allied Leaders and Others by Telegram</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] After the German army occupied Czechoslovakia during this war, they implemented a campaign of slaughter and arrest to suppress Czech students. From November 17, 1939, they crazily murdered students and professors in Prague and other major Czech cities, with the number of victims reaching thousands. Most students were detained in concentration camps, and all educational institutions were closed. The World Student Congress designated this day (November 17) as World Student Day in 1941. To commemorate this historically moving event, students from various schools in Shanghai held a Shanghai Student Commemoration "World Student Day" assembly at the Shanghai Municipal Gymnasium on Shaanxi Road yesterday morning. Participants included about 5,000 students from 24 countries, including China, Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, Spain, Hungary, Portugal, Switzerland, Sweden, Greece, India, Denmark, and Italy. The presidium was composed of representatives from five units: Xia Dacheng of Jiaotong University, Zhang Ruoling of Datong University, Wang Chenghan of Minji University, as well as representatives from Jiaotong University and Fudan University. There were also one student representative from each of the five countries of Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, France, and Czechoslovakia. Guests included Mayor Wu, Chairman Fang, Director Wu, and presidents of various universities. The venue was decorated solemnly, with national flags of various countries hanging everywhere, and slogans in Chinese, English, French, and Russian posted on the pillars. Behind the grandstand were four giant portraits of the leaders of China, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union. The stage was surrounded by white and red bamboo cloth, with a large Party and national flag and a portrait of the Founding Father as the background. Flower pots were placed in front of the stage, and the flags of 24 countries were inserted on the stage.</p>
<p>Chairman Jiang's Report</p>
<p>The conference began at 9:30 AM. After the presidium took their seats, the police band played music and sang the national anthem. After the formalities, Jiang Yingsheng, a student from Fudan University and chairman of the conference, reported on the significance of the assembly, stating: "The sacrifice of Czech students was worthwhile. Nazism has left the most shameful record in human history. We hope that everyone will not avoid hardships and continue to strive for world peace."</p>
<p>Mayor Wu's Speech</p>
<p>Mayor Wu then delivered a speech: "Today's World Student Day commemoration assembly reminds me of an ancient saying, 'Those who are great should not lose the heart of a child,' because only a young mind is a clean white paper, and once it enters society, it is influenced by the environment. Young people all over the world hope for a happy world, so they must always maintain a pure heart, pursue the truth, and not be used by political parties. Therefore, we must support the National Assembly and hope to change the battlefield into a political arena." Several foreign guests also gave speeches, generally emphasizing international cooperation and world peace.</p>
<p>Chairman Fang's Speech</p>
<p>Later, Chairman Fang of the Municipal Party Committee delivered a speech, stating: "Today's commemoration of World Student Day is worth celebrating! The power of young people all over the world can promote the progress and peace of the world. Young people are the most precious part of the national spirit. Any country without outstanding young students will perish. What we need now is peace, unity, and democracy. But today, if we want to consolidate world peace, we must first seek China's unity, solidarity, peace, and democracy. However, Zhou Enlai, the representative of the Communist Party, said in the newspaper that the Communist Party's survival is won by fighting. Does the world today still need to fight? The Kuomintang convened the National Assembly, hoping to return power to the people, but the Communist Party is preventing it. In the future, I hope that young people can support the National Assembly to seek peace. Whoever destroys peace is our enemy."</p>
<p>Director Wu's Opinion</p>
<p>Finally, Wu Shaoshu, director of the Youth League, expressed three opinions: (1) History tells us that young people are the vanguard against aggression, and we hope that young people can still be the leaders against aggression. (2) Young people are not afraid of sacrifice, so young people are the main force in defending the nation. (3) Anyone who attempts to destroy young people will eventually fail. At the end, the conference passed the "Letter to Young Students Across the Country" and shouted slogans. The conference did not end until after 11:00 AM. After the meeting, a grand parade was held. The procession was led by the Shanghai Municipal Police Band and the Boy Scout Band. Portraits of the four major Allied leaders (China, the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union) and the flags of the 24 member countries of the United Nations were all displayed. The procession started from the gymnasium on Shaanxi South Road, passed through Central Zheng Road, Tongfu Road, turned into Nanjing Road, and dispersed at the Huangpu Park on the Bund. The "Letter to Young Students Across the Country" passed by the conference is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Letter to Young Students</p>
<p>Students, today we have once again encountered this tragic commemorative day! Since 1940, every time we encounter November 17th of each year, we cannot help but feel endless grief and indignation. When we recall the cruel and brutal acts of the German fascists and militarists, the destruction of human life, and the attack on world culture, we cannot help but feel righteous indignation and hair-splitting rage. What kind of world is this? What kind of era is this? Who with a conscience can still tolerate it? Who can still sit idly by? Let alone we young students under the world's scientific, cultural, and educational system? Since 1941, we have chosen this day when German aggressors cruelly massacred Czech students and destroyed Czech educational institutions as our common commemorative day, not for any other purpose. We are here to bravely shoulder the task of maintaining peace and protecting culture. We loudly shout slogans such as international cooperation, eliminating aggression, seeking happiness, and promoting culture. We resolutely fight against the flames of fascism and against the toxins of aggression. If we still have work to do, our work is nothing else but anti-aggression and anti-massacre. If our work still has a mission, then our mission is nothing else but for the happiness of mankind and for the culture of the world. Our work will eventually not fail, and our mission will eventually be accomplished. Young students all over the world, participating in the struggle against aggression and massacre, have each demonstrated the highest spirit of sacrifice, and finally defeated our common enemy. From May of last year, the invading militarists collapsed. From September of last year, the Japanese imperialists also perished one after another. Since then, the world has seen the light again, and the times have returned to the right track. For more than a year, the foundation of peace has been consolidated, and the dawn of human happiness has already emerged before our eyes. History has once again proven that "justice" will surely prevail. In the future, mankind should be able to move forward under its call!</p>
<p>But students, we do not shy away from saying that the undercurrent of war has not receded, and international suspicion has not disappeared. Although peace is in hand, cooperation is still difficult to achieve. In such a situation, the conscience of mankind will undoubtedly be subjected to unprecedented trials. How to make unnecessary gaps can be communicated and unwarranted prejudices can be eliminated, which should be the common responsibility of our world students. In order to increase more happiness for mankind and promote the rational development of world culture, we must continue to make positive and constructive efforts based on the past ideas and will of anti-aggression and anti-massacre.</p>
<p>Students, we all believe that international cooperation and consolidating peace are the most important undertakings at present. For the progress of society and the continuation of life, we absolutely do not allow war to happen again. Let us continue to work together for the happiness of mankind and the culture of the world. Justice will surely prevail! Let us all shout slogans together: (1) Students all over the world unite! (2) Consolidate world peace! (3) Strengthen international cooperation! (4) Long live the Republic of China! (5) Long live the United Nations! Initiated by the Shanghai Students Commemorating "World Student Day" Assembly, November 17th.</p>
<p>Beijing Commemorative Meeting</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper in Nanjing, 17th] Today, the 17th, is "World Student Day." More than 2,000 students from various schools and representatives of vocational youth groups in Beijing gathered at the Dazhong Theater at 9:30 AM to hold a commemorative meeting. After the music was played and the meeting began, the national anthem of the United Nations was played. Then, Cao Wanru, a female student from Jinling Women's University and chair of the meeting, delivered a speech, elaborating on the origins of World Student Day and stating that young students in the future should have two beliefs: "eliminate war forever" and "promote the spirit of democracy and freedom." Subsequently, students from various schools and the representative of French youth delivered speeches. Li Junlong, director of the Central Propaganda Department of the Youth League, also delivered a speech on the spot, emphasizing the strength of youth power and encouraging students to raise their vigilance, unite with world students, and strive for peace. Finally, the conference passed four telegrams of tribute: to President Chiang, to Czech youth, to the leaders of Fiji, and to the London World Youth Association. The ceremony concluded and adjourned at 10:30 AM.</p>

<h3>Qingbai Captain's Misconduct; Tung Wah Wins One to Zero; Tung Wah's Performance Excellent in Four Wins; 20,000 Fans at Yiyuan Outraged</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] In the first-round championship battle of this season's football league, the Tung Wah and Qingbai teams met at Yiyuan yesterday afternoon. Tung Wah, with four wins in four games, defeated Qingbai one to zero, avenging the humiliation of last season's defeat. The first half ended with no score for either side. Yesterday's early winter weather was calm and sunny, and the order among the approximately 20,000 fans was quite good, which was rare and marked the first major event of this season's football matches. Unfortunately, during the second half of the match, Qingbai captain Xu Wenkui's rough behavior aroused great dissatisfaction among the audience, which was deeply regrettable.</p>
<p>Tung Wah Shows Signs of Revival</p>
<p>Tung Wah played very well yesterday, showing signs of revival. The forwards were quite aggressive. Apart from Ade and Sun Jinshun showing their age, the wingers Li Yao and Jia Youliang were very active, especially with Han Longhai. If it weren't for Tai Bao keeping the goal, Qingbai would have been breached long ago. In addition to the forwards, the defenders also worked hard. Zhuang Youren played better than ever before. From the goalkeeper to the center back line, everyone performed their duties properly. Looking back at Qingbai, although Jin Qiuting flew in from Hong Kong, he did nothing yesterday. After Li Yishen and Zhang Banglun collided and were injured in the first half, the forwards became disorganized. However, the defense was very strong, especially Yan Shixin, who stood out. Tai Bao was injured, and Qin Bi Gao was far behind, so yesterday was a match of one attacking and one defending. Tung Wah's victory did not seem accidental.</p>
<p>A-Kui's Rudeness Arouses Public Outrage</p>
<p>Fifteen minutes into the second half, Tung Wah scored a goal against Qingbai, and Li Yangchen and Tai Bao were also injured one after another. The actions of the Qingbai players gradually became rough, and the captain Xu Wenkui deliberately stepped on Zhang Lingen with both feet. Fortunately, he was not seriously injured. The referee, lacking courage, did not impose severe penalties in order to maintain order. The 20,000 spectators were aroused to public outrage and threw orange peels at A-Kui, shouting and expressing great dissatisfaction with Qingbai. Winning or losing is a common occurrence, but for a captain to take such an excessive action is deeply regrettable, especially since the anger of the public is difficult to offend and the sanction of public opinion is to be feared. After the game, the Qingbai players were escorted off the field by the police. Those who lack the spirit and morality of sports are no less than receiving a head-on blow.</p>
<p>Tung Wah Offense Fails to Score</p>
<p>Referee He Chunhui ordered the game to begin. Qingbai kicked off, but was blocked and returned. Tung Wah seized the opportunity to rise and attack strongly. After five minutes, Li Yao hooked the ball, and Longhai shot it over the field. Li Yao shot fiercely twice, but both were caught by Tai Douka. After sixteen minutes, Longhai hammered from twenty yards out, low and fast, but unfortunately hit the crossbar. After that, it was still Tung Wah's world, but they repeatedly attacked without success, to no avail. After 31 minutes, Qingbai attacked. Li Si Kai dribbled the ball quickly, and Banglun rushed out, colliding with Li. Yishen was injured and fell to the ground, leaving the field temporarily. Tung Wah took advantage of the situation to attack fiercely. Youliang took two corner kicks, and the landing points were good. Xiao Li Yao shot cleverly, and Tai Douka lay on the ground and hugged the ball, turning danger into safety. After 39 minutes, Yishen re-entered the field and fought with injuries. Two minutes later, Sun Jinshun kicked hard from a distance, and the ball flew out like an arrow. Tai desperately saved it. Li Yao stepped forward and collided with Tai, causing Tai to injure his foot. Qin Bi Gao came on to replace him. Before long, the first half ended, and the two sides were tied at zero to zero, with nothing gained.</p>
<p>Longhai's Goal Secures Victory</p>
<p>After a rest, the two teams tried again. Tung Wah's A-Dai took a short break, and Huang Kehou took over as the center forward. Qingbai also replaced Li Si Kai with Xue Weitai. After twelve minutes, Sun Lao Jin picked and sent the ball forward, Longhai scurried up, dribbled a few times, and kicked it into the net. Tung Wah opened the scoring, and the audience cheered, firecrackers rang, and the mood was enthusiastic. At the same time, Gao Baozheng left the field due to injury. After that, Qingbai's actions gradually became rough, and Xu Wenkui's deliberate act of stepping on Zhang Lingen caused a loss of sportsmanship, and the audience was in an uproar. Before long, Baozheng recovered from his injury and returned to the field. Qingbai attacked, Xu Wenkui hooked the ball (at this time, A-Kui was filling in as the right winger), and Xue Weitai added a shot, but it was too high, by about a foot, and nothing was gained. In order to strengthen the offensive, Qingbai had a scattered front line and could not reverse the decline. By the time the final whistle sounded, Tung Wah had defeated Qingbai by a score of one to zero.</p>

The referees are Liu Hesheng and Qu Honglu. Zheng Lun has a brilliant record in Shanghai. Recently, they narrowly defeated the Black and White team by one point.

<h3>Black and White Team's Performance Disappointing; Loses Again to Shan Team Last Night; Black and White Women's Team Beats Xuebai Again</h3>
<p>The Black and White basketball team lost to the Shan team by a score of 32 to 26 last night due to Xiao Huatuo's absence. In the first half, Black and White took the lead by one point with a score of 13 to 12. In the women's game, the competition was quite fierce. Xuebai fought hard in the first half, tying with Black and White at 21 each. Unfortunately, they were defeated in the second half due to exhaustion. Both sides performed very well and were worth watching. The final score was 44 to 31, with the Black and White women's team winning. The first quarter ended with no winner at 9 to 9, and the first half ended with 21 points each. Xuebai began to fall behind in the second half. The third quarter ended at 31 to 23, and the final score was 44 to 31. Black and White performed well, and Xuebai's ability to resist fiercely was also unexpected.</p>
<p>Black and White Score Xuebai Score</p>
<p>Chen Yurun 18 Guo Aizhen 0</p>
<p>Yang Xiuzhi 8 Xu Xiuyun 0</p>
<p>Chen Lixiang 0 Ren Kuanping 18</p>

<p>Wu Yuwu 0 Huang Ruyu 0</p>
<p>Cai Shuqiong 0 Total 31</p>
<p>Total 44</p>
<p>The men's game saw both sides adopt the same style, charging wildly without any tactics. The shooting accuracy was poor, with both sides being similar. It was a miracle that no score was recorded for seven minutes, and all points were scored by free throws. It was also a strange occurrence that the Shan team scored three points and the Black and White team scored one point in the first quarter. Afterwards, the scores remained within two or three points of each other, with the first half ending at 13 to 12. The Shan team gradually gained momentum in the second half, with the third quarter ending at 21 to 17, and the final result being 32 to 26. The game lacked excitement, and Black and White's performance was particularly disappointing.</p>

<h3>International Culture and Education New Offerings: A Good Remedy for Ignorance, A Precious Raft for Helping the Distressed</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent for this Newspaper in Paris, Hong Fu</p>
<p>Airmail News from the 6th</p>
<p>Following the Second European War, the United Nations organization emerged, somewhat like the League of Nations after the First European War. It still has the General Assembly and the Security Council, managing important economic and social policies. Underneath it are the Standing Committee and nine directly administered commissions. (1) Economy and Occupation, including four sub-groups: (A) Placement of occupations, (B) Balancing salary and commodity prices, (C) Economic development, (D) Reconstruction of war-torn areas. (2) Transportation and scheduled passenger and freight transport. (3) Collection and publication of statistics. (4) Human rights protection, divided into three subgroups: (A) Freedom of interview and publication, such as allowing foreign journalists to investigate occupied areas of a certain country. (B) Assistance to weak minorities, such as providing joint assistance if a group of people are bullied by the majority because of their language or religion. (C) Prevention of discrimination against certain ethnic groups, such as Jews. (5) Women's issues, such as combating prostitution and promoting women's rights. (6) Social relief work. (7) Curbing opium and narcotics. Its independent agency for negotiation and implementation with the Standing Committee is called the Special Affairs Bureau, now with nine types, of which three have been established: (A) United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). (B) United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). (C) International Labour Organization (ILO). There are six more under preparation: (D) Restoring normalcy and development to international banks. For example, resolving the blocking of foreign assets awaits deliberation by this agency. (E) International Civil Aviation. (F) World Health. (G) International Refugee Relief, which requires a particularly large budget, reportedly 260 trillion US dollars. (H) World Trade Organization.</p>
<p>The United Nations refers generally to the forty-four countries including the US, UK, Russia, China, and France. Terms like "International" and "World" encompass the entire globe without limitation. Following the Paris Peace Conference, UNESCO, the "United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization," which is starting a large-scale publicity campaign through exhibitions, speeches, and films, will convene representatives from forty-four countries in Paris on November 19 of this year. The preparatory office is also stationed in Paris. According to its organizational outline, the Executive Secretary oversees nine divisions: (1) Education Division. (2) Natural Sciences Division, encompassing chemistry, electrical science, biology, meteorology, and other disciplines. (3) Social Sciences Division, encompassing history, international law, and more. (4) Arts Division. (5) Literature and Philosophy Division. (6) Mass Media Division, integrating newspapers, films, and broadcasting for public communication. (7) Libraries, Museums, and Books Division. (8) International Relations Division. (9) War-torn Area Reconstruction Division.</p>
<p>The main tasks of the Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization are threefold: (1) To strive to publicize the details of all cultural endeavors within each country to other nations through the publication of printed materials and the exchange of ideas. This method is most conducive to strengthening understanding between nations and is the beginning of lasting peace. (2) To ensure that healthy people worldwide, regardless of race, gender, status, wealth, or poverty, can receive education and increase their knowledge. If a national government desires foreign assistance, other nations can provide various conveniences. Simultaneously, strive to adopt the best educational methods to ensure that children in all countries possess democratic and free-thinking ideals. (3) To popularize scientific knowledge among people of all sectors using the following three methods: A. Establishing international agreements to properly plan for the protection and preservation of rare and unique art pieces, historical structures, and national treasures. B. By countries cooperating with each other, exchanging scholars, lecturers, books, artistic and scientific items, and all kinds of information. C. Books or exhibitions that are difficult to obtain in one country can be borrowed from other countries at any time. In terms of the assistance provided by various countries to China, the most commendable of the nine divisions of the aforementioned Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization is the Natural Sciences Division. The Sino-British Science Cooperation Office, established in Chongqing in 1942, bore four major missions: One, to complete the liaison between the Chinese government and various European and American academic societies; two, to continuously bring European and American scientific data and information to China; three, to report scientific investigations from China to Europe and America; and four, to contribute knowledge of science and technology to the Chinese and British governments. In these four years, 30 scientific instruments were sent to China by airplane, distributed to 400 experimental units. 200 kinds of English journals were sent, with seven copies each, one original copy, and six microfilm copies that could be enlarged for viewing. 7,000 copies of scientific books. 140 theses were sent from China to the US, published in various Western newspapers and magazines. 100 copies of complete journals and 1,000 books published in China were stored in major libraries. The Cooperative Office also sent specialists to personally visit 300 Chinese educational, scientific, and industrial institutions. The Cooperative Office also facilitated inquiries from the Chinese people and military technical groups, answering hundreds of questions, such as new knowledge related to Aerodynamics for high-altitude long-distance flight, and Isotopicmasses and Insecticides belonging to the chemical department, providing whatever was requested.</p>
<p>Now that Chinese currency is inflating and new Western trends are advancing rapidly, it is very difficult to transfer them to China. Private individuals with ambitions have insufficient funds to purchase expensive European and American newspapers and books. With this cultural and educational organization, and the Sino-British cooperation providing guidance in many ways, and supplying spiritual nourishment, it is truly a good remedy for ignorance and a precious raft for helping the distressed. It is hoped that people with a heart for the country will recruit European and American talents, supplemented by Chinese elders, to further enhance Sino-foreign cooperation, and quickly translate it into Chinese, both to benefit the 400 to 500 million intellectually impoverished people and to provide placement for intellectuals who are beneficial to the country. Urgency is of the essence; the sooner, the better. Otherwise, books left idle for too long will become outdated, and their value will greatly diminish.</p>
<h3>Squatting Movement in Britain</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent for this Newspaper in London, Xue Yan</p>
<p>Airmail News from October 20th</p>
<p>The political situation in Britain is currently not very calm, but because of several problems that are not interconnected but can influence each other, coupled with the participation of political party activists in promoting them, they have stirred up storms and become the focus of attention. Such as the issue of squatting and building houses, Wallace's speech in New York, Stalin's response to questions from a reporter for the British Sunday Times, and the series of demonstrations launched by the Communist Party in response to these issues.</p>
<p>During the war, housing construction almost stopped, and with the bombing by enemy planes, the housing supply was insufficient. Now that the war is over and soldiers have returned, the housing problem remains serious. Furthermore, after this drastic change, many people's occupations have changed, and with the change of occupations, residences have to be relocated, which is normal, but it is also a fact that this has further imbalanced the distribution of housing. As summer ends and winter approaches, people who had been vacationing at the seaside have returned to London for the New Year, and the severity of the housing problem has become more acute. Some poor people, who had been living in houses requisitioned by the government, are now being asked to move out as the requisition period has expired and the government wants to return the houses to their original owners and ask them to move out to find housing. This notice was not sudden; it had been announced a year in advance, but now it has reached the final deadline, so it must be enforced. It is estimated that 1,000 households are actually affected. These 1,000 households protested by marching and demonstrating, and then spontaneously moved into several of the most luxurious hotels before the war, which had been requisitioned by the government as reception centers for foreign guests during the war, but are currently vacant, and are being prepared for return to their original owners for business after repairs. This is the origin of the squatting movement, which is very natural. After this movement occurred, the social response was very good, and many people sympathized with it, believing that it was better to let the poor live in peace than to let the owners get rich. When the first squatters set out, many taxis volunteered to help them move without charging a penny, and many spectators spontaneously donated money for relief, and the amount collected was quite large. Who knew that once this trend started, many dissatisfied people followed suit (there are now similar movements in Canada and France), and dozens of squatting incidents occur every day. The Communist Party saw an opportunity and joined the organization, engaging in planned squatting and launching mass rallies everywhere, using this as a means to attack the government. If this happened in a colony, it would be easy to handle. Just have the police fire a few shots, arrest a few people, or release tear gas, and it could probably be resolved. But here, without a court warrant, the police cannot arrest people, and firing shots or releasing tear gas is unimaginable. The government's countermeasure is simply to cut off the electricity to the occupied houses (but water is still supplied), send police to block the doors of houses that may be occupied, and notify homeless residents to register with the government for allocation of houses requisitioned by the government. Finally, the government collects evidence and files a complaint with the court against the five leaders, accusing them of organizing a group, illegally occupying private property, and disrupting public order. According to reporters who have learned from other sources, the number of people accused by the government and the charges are very light, which is precisely because the government does not have much confidence. Because laws such as organizing a group and disrupting public order are very complicated and can be interpreted in various ways, the court may not accept the case, and the government may not win. The more confident charge is illegally occupying private property, but it seems that the owners should come forward. After two weeks of investigation by the court, it was determined that the government's accusations were true, and five arrest warrants were issued, arresting the five accused. Thus, the government's dignity was protected by the court. Here, what we should pay attention to is not only the actual authority of the court, which is respected by society, but its spiritual authority is especially important. Before the court made a decision, squatting incidents occurred every day, and the government and the Communist Party worked hard to publicize and win social sympathy, so social opinion was not consistent. Some people thought that the Communist Party was deliberately trying to overthrow the government, but others thought that the government had indeed handled the situation abnormally. Once the court's decision was announced, public opinion immediately became consistent, believing that since the court had investigated and found the accusations to be true, the Communist Party was deliberately trying to overthrow the government, and even the Communist Party's newspaper changed its tone. The squatting movement came to an end. But if anyone thinks this is the result of the arrest of five Communist Party members, that is not true, because these five people were bailed out from the beginning, and their actions remained free before the verdict was finalized. The problem is that after the court accepted the case, there was a standard for right and wrong, and society's perspective changed, no longer sympathizing with those who were trying to overthrow the government. Having lost social sympathy, the Communist Party also ceased its activities.</p>
<p>On the day the court announced its decision, many newspapers had headlines saying that the government had won a major victory. However, the Daily Worker, the government party's newspaper, specially emphasized clarification, saying that although the problem of the Communist Party being overthrown had been resolved, the government did not take it as a victory. On the contrary, there were still many people whose housing problems could not be solved, and the government deeply regretted this, fully felt that its responsibility had not been fulfilled, and should redouble its efforts. Then the government announced plans to speed up the completion of housing construction. According to the published goals, by Christmas, more than 430,000 homes would be completed in one district of London, of which more than 180,000 would be permanent homes, and the rest would be temporary homes. According to a government announcement, the above-mentioned houses were planned to start construction before the end of July, and now they are speeding up completion. However, according to the Communist Party, this is the result of the squatting movement, and the government has once again listed the issue of building houses as the top priority in the construction plan.</p>
<p>Government to Speed Up Completion of New Housing Plans Before Christmas</p>
<p>On the international front, former US Secretary of Commerce Wallace's speech in New York, advocating that the United States should cooperate with the Soviet Union instead of being a cat's paw for British imperialism, and Stalin's conversation with a reporter from the British Sunday Times, saying that the UK and the Soviet Union should strengthen political, commercial, and cultural ties. These two closely followed events have had a profound impression in Britain, especially giving the British Communist Party a great impetus. Recently, the Communist Party has repeatedly launched mass rallies and demonstrations, almost all using these two events and the housing problem as propaganda materials. Regarding Wallace's speech, British public opinion initially did not pay much attention to it. The reasons for not paying attention to it were first, Britain knew that the motivation for the speech was for the sake of campaigning. Secondly, judging from the actual environment of the current international situation, it was felt that Wallace's speech was not in line with the facts, because in the current international conferences, US-Soviet conflicts were more frequent than UK-Soviet conflicts. But the consequences caused by this speech have left a deep impression on Britain. President Truman's vacillation seems to the British to be out of line with the demeanor of a statesman. Wallace's eventual resignation is felt to show the strength of anti-Soviet forces in the United States. As for Stalin's answers, not finding an American reporter but finding a British reporter already has a sense of emphasizing Britain over the United States. Furthermore, Stalin's statement that he hoped to strengthen UK-Soviet political, commercial, and cultural ties was seen as evidence that the Soviet Union was willing to deal with socialist Britain. Originally, in Britain, there was also a considerable number of people who had long believed that there were no irreconcilable conflicts between the UK and the Soviet Union. In this world situation of US-Soviet rivalry, Britain might as well step aside and not necessarily be in the middle. This view seems to be even more powerful with the sharpening of the US-Soviet conflict. In this changing international situation, the Communist Party seems to have a sense that "I am not alone." Organizing mass rallies and launching demonstrations are becoming more and more energetic. "Don't let American bankers be the bosses of the world," "UK-Soviet cooperation to stop American capitalists from dominating the world," "The whole world is behind Wallace," etc., are the loudest slogans in Communist propaganda.</p>
<h3>Visiting the National Assembly Representatives of Overseas Chinese from Vietnam and Malaya</h3>
<p>— Reporter for this Newspaper, Huang Xingtian</p>
<p>News from Nanjing, 13th</p>
<p>The climate in Nanjing is colder than in Shanghai, almost a month apart in weather, but Mr. Xiang Yutang, the National Assembly representative of overseas Chinese from Saigon, Vietnam, is still wearing a thin white suit, without an overcoat, and still doesn't seem to feel cold. The National Assembly commemorative badge with tricolor ribbons, hanging on his white coat, shines even more brightly.</p>
<p>Xiang Yutang</p>
<p>Mr. Xiang is in his fifties, but he doesn't wear a beard, his vigor is very strong, and he is also very talkative. When the reporter made a friendly visit to him, he told me a lot about Vietnam, past and present. According to him, he was an old comrade of the Father of the Nation during the revolution. At that time, it was forbidden to use the name "Association" in the Nanyang area, so the Father of the Nation established institutions everywhere under the name of "Yixuan Reading Newspaper Society" as a gathering place for promoting revolution and advocating revolution, and "Yixuan" was a transliteration from "Yixian." He became involved in the revolutionary movement in the Yixuan Reading Newspaper Society in Saigon, and even now, although he is the boss of Xiangda Ji and Huaqiang Printing Bureau, he is still responsible for handling the affairs of the Chinese Workers' Union in the Vietnam region, which is more than thirty years.</p>
<p>According to Mr. Xiang, the current situation of French rule in Vietnam is even worse than when our country's land was occupied by the Japanese enemy. For example, Saigon is surrounded by Vietnamese natives and this has been for a long time, and the circle of encirclement is gradually shrinking. When he came, it was only two kilometers from the city. French troops cannot communicate with the outside world, and they dare not go out alone in groups of three or four. As a result, there is a panic about food in the city, which ultimately harms our compatriots. Chinese food shops and rice shops have become targets of robbery, and the situation is very chaotic. The Annamese hate the French very much, but the French still want to alienate the feelings between China and Vietnam, but they have failed. The feelings between the Chinese and Vietnamese people are very good, especially the Annamese have a very good impression of our National Army, and they are friendly like friends.</p>
<p>There is only one thing that Mr. Xiang feels troublesome about, which is that the more chaotic the situation, the greater the power of the Communist Party in Vietnam, and even the General Labor Union has been infiltrated by their traces. But he is still very confident and said: "Now some of the powers have been occupied by some rascals and bad guys due to the chaotic situation, but it doesn't matter, most of them can't do things well. If things are not done well, I can easily change the current evil situation."</p>
<p>As for the situation in the motherland, he said that the general overseas Chinese are very concerned about it, and they hate those who destroy peace and harm the country to the bone, but they sincerely hope that their motherland will stop the civil strife and move towards the road of construction; therefore, they have great expectations for the opening of the National Assembly. As for himself, he believes that</p>
<p>President Chiang will surely follow the Father of the Nation's will and complete the great cause of nation-building, and therefore he always wholeheartedly supports him.</p>
<p>He Ruqun</p>
<p>Mr. He Ruqun, the National Assembly representative of overseas Chinese from Malaya, is the president of the Penang Guangdong and Tingzhou Association and the chairman of the Hakka Association; he also opened a Wanshan Zhan pharmacy on Tianzai Street in Penang, and is a very prominent and prestigious overseas Chinese leader among the overseas Chinese in Malaya. He is also in his forties, his beard and hair are already gray, but his spirit is also very good: he said that the situation of overseas Chinese in Malaya has been affected by the Indonesian independence movement, and their businesses have suffered a lot of losses in various aspects, but the feelings between the Indonesians and the overseas Chinese are also very good, and many overseas Chinese have the greatest sympathy for the fate of Indonesia, and some even sacrifice their property and lives in it. However, their greatest hope is still placed on the motherland, letting the powerful motherland support them in gaining a foothold in the Nanyang area without being despised. Therefore, they also deeply hope for domestic peace, deeply hope for the success of this National Assembly, and deeply hope that the motherland will move towards the road of democratic and strong prosperity.</p>

<h3>Xinjiang Through a Lens (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Originally written by Drake, Special Correspondent for the Los Angeles Times, specially translated by our Editorial Department.</p>
<p>It cannot be said that there have been few foreign journalists who have travelled in Xinjiang in the past four years. However, the author of this article, Drake, is the first. Drake's familiarity with the inside story of Xinjiang is deeper than that of any other journalist. His dispatches consist of six articles, and this is the first, which describes in great detail the political developments and situation in Xinjiang since the Yining rebellion. We have translated it as follows: (Editor)</p>
<p>Does Resources Flow East or West?</p>
<p>Here, in the heart of Central Asia, behind the snow-capped Tianshan Mountains, China is engaged in a valiant struggle for her future security, striving to overcome her formidable geographical difficulties and the constant political and economic pressure from her powerful western neighbours. The reporter believes that developments in the coming months will determine whether the natural resources of the vast Xinjiang province will flow eastward to aid China's revival, or westward to aid the development of Soviet industry.</p>
<p>Today, Xinjiang finds itself in an extremely precarious position, a crisis that is the direct result of the armed Muslim rebellion that began in September 1944 and formally ended on January 2, 1946. The defeat of the Chinese army in this rebellion casts an ominous shadow over the future destiny of Xinjiang.</p>
<p>The rebellion began in the Ili region on the border of the Shanshan Mountains, when several Turkic Uyghur prisoners escaped from the prison in the village of Wulasitai, launching a long-brewing rebellion that quickly spread to the rich Ili, Taiba Jiatai, and Altai regions in northwestern Xinjiang. Yining, a strategic border city in Xinjiang that is now the capital of the rebel government, fell on January 30, 1945, after an eighty-seven-day siege, followed by the massacre of thousands of Chinese residents.</p>
<p>During the siege of Yining, military operations were directed by three Muslim leaders. These three signed a peace treaty with General Zhang Zhizhong, the current chairman of Xinjiang Province, in January and June 6 of this year. All three now hold important positions in both the Xinjiang government and the rebel oligarchy. These three are: Kazimov, 30 years old, a Uyghur, nicknamed "the soul of the Xinjiang people," and currently the Vice Chairman of Xinjiang Province. Kaode Zhafu, 40 years old, a Uyghur political leader. She'er, a Kazakh, who is officially Chairman Zhang's representative in Ili.</p>
<p>After the fall of Yining, the rebels gained new strength, adding modern artillery and bombers bearing the rebel crescent moon emblem to their forces. During the winter advance in the snowy Tianshan Mountains, countless Chinese soldiers froze to death, and many units were largely annihilated by local guerrillas accustomed to the cold climate.</p>
<p>The rebel forces, composed of a mixture of Uyghurs, Kazakhs, and Karluk Mongols, numbered a total of 30,000 and controlled the entire northwestern region of Xinjiang bordering Mongolia by the spring and summer of 1945. They still control this area. They captured the strategic city of Changsu on September 5, 1945, but were later stopped on the banks of the Manas River, 70 miles from Dihua. General Zhang Zhizhong then flew to Dihua, where the Soviet Consul General in Dihua mediated peace talks with the rebels. The victorious Muslims softened their stance, and in January of this year, signed most of the Sino-Uyghur treaty, allowing the Muslims to maintain six regiments of native Muslim troops in the three occupied areas in the northwest under Chairman Zhang.</p>
<p>The final treaty was signed on June 6 of this year and took effect on July 1. The treaty includes a crucial "proviso" that the border area between the rebel-held area and the Soviet Union is to be guarded by troops of the Chinese National Government. However, one year after the start of the peace talks, not a single soldier of the National Government has been stationed on the border with the Soviet Union. The rebel Muslims in the Yining area do not fly the Chinese national flag, but a white flag with a crescent moon emblem, inscribed with the words "People's Republic of East Turkestan" in Turkic. In the streets of Yining, soldiers wearing green uniforms and crescent moon badges can be seen everywhere. In the shops of Yining, Soviet-made clothing, sweets, and movie cameras outnumber similar Chinese goods. The Sino-Soviet Aviation Company's transport planes (American) regularly fly between Yining and Alma-Ata (a modern city in Soviet Kazakhstan, 200 miles west of Yining), on highways that are becoming Soviet-style trucking routes.</p>
<p>The treaty can serve as a means for Xinjiang people to experiment with autonomy, and also as a tool for implementing democracy in mainland China. The treaty grants the people of Xinjiang Province various exceptional privileges, including the right to elect 15 of the 25 members of the provincial government, freedom of speech and assembly, minimum taxation, and freedom of domestic and foreign trade, subject to current Chinese treaties.</p>
<p>Judging from the current situation, China's efforts to obtain oil, coal, gold, tungsten, leather, and grains from northwestern Xinjiang have been frustrated, partly because the Muslim rebels have been slow to implement certain provisions of the treaty. As a result, Dihua and other Chinese-controlled areas in Xinjiang province are mired in terrible inflation and poverty due to a lack of industrial and transportation facilities.</p>
<p>However, it must be said that the Chinese government is probably half responsible for the deplorable economic situation in Xinjiang province, because it has failed to provide Chairman Zhang with sufficient funds to repair necessary roads and provide the economic assistance needed to restore friendly relations between Yining and Dihua.</p>
<p>The reporter is reminded of the same situation that occurred in the Nine Eastern Provinces. Although the actual situation on the southwestern border of Xinjiang is not entirely clear, the aggressive Soviet developers who, with the connivance of the warlord Sheng Shicai before 1944, relentlessly plundered Xinjiang's resources are certainly not accustomed to idleness.</p>
<p>Xinjiang is larger in area than the Nine Eastern Provinces, and its resources and livestock are probably also greater than those of the Nine Eastern Provinces. For China to lose so many resources would be like the United States losing the resources of New Mexico, Arizona, Nevada, and Utah.</p>
<h3>Inside and Outside the Factory City (Conclusion)</h3>
<p>— Our Special Correspondent Hang Zhou</p>
<p>Jining Snowstorm</p>
<p>Taking the PingSui Railway north from Datong, one enters a silver-white world after leaving the Great Wall. "It's cold!" A soft exclamation emanates from the heart of a visitor from the South. The northerners hear it and smile secretly: "Cold? It's still early! When it's really cold, your outfit will be like summer cloth."</p>
<p>We were very fortunate: we did not experience such weather, but during our few days in Jining, we tasted a bit of it. Jining is the highest point in Suiyuan, 1,400 meters above sea level. It is a second-class county, established not long ago. Before the ninth year of the Republic (1920), it was just a desolate village. Due to the many troubles in the north, this small city was transformed into a strategic point for national defense. General Tang Si Bo once commanded the Battle of Bailingmiao here and built national defense fortifications. After the Japanese army occupied this place, they greatly strengthened the fortifications. After the Communist army came, they rebuilt them again. Therefore, Jining's fortifications are famous in the north.</p>
<p>However, the solid fortifications are not a blessing for Jining. I walked on the snow-covered ground of Jining after the war, like walking in an ancient temple, frighteningly quiet, heartbreakingly dilapidated! Although the war is long over, the atmosphere of war still exists. The shouts of "Password!" emanate from the dark corners at any time, piercing the deathly air, like the howls of wild leopards in the wilderness. It is said that remnants of the Communist army are still scattered in the countryside.</p>
<p>The wind blows gently, blowing like a needle, piercing the bone marrow. The arrival of more than twenty "honored guests" is a major trouble for the welcomers. Most of the reporter group did not bring luggage. Northerners sleep on heated brick beds that are scalding hot, with a coal-burning stove beside them emitting fumes. The windows are tightly closed, not letting in a breath of air. Sleeping on the bed feels like roasting sweet potatoes. The next day, the lips are parched, the tongue is cracked, and the back and waist ache. If you don't want to heat the bed, you must cover yourself with thick quilts. Locals say they only take three baths in their lives: once at birth, once at marriage, and once at death. A piece of clothing is worn from new to tattered without ever being washed. Fleas, if they are considered uncomfortable, are news. Who would have the courage to use a quilt that can be borrowed locally? I had no choice but to borrow a military blanket from Garrison Commander Ju Zhulin, cover myself with a coat, and sleep haphazardly, only to catch a cold the next morning.</p>
<p>The snow stopped on the 6th, but the clouds were still very low. County Magistrate He Fengwu specially mobilized 1,000 civilians to sweep the airfield, but it was all in vain. The Beiping Air Force sent a telegram saying: "The plane cannot land." We were extremely bored trapped in the guest house. When the people of Jining heard that a reporter group had arrived, they came in twos and threes to complain and petition, as if they were treating us as "imperial envoys" or relief commissioners. This one said: "The Eighth Route Army killed my whole family!" That one said: "The Eighth Route Army took away my mule!" Another said: "Sir, my whole family cannot survive!" ... They all started crying as they spoke. We didn't know whether to cry with them or hide, it was very embarrassing.</p>
<p>One Night in GuiSui</p>
<p>It rained again in Jining on the 7th, and we still couldn't leave. GuiSui telegraphed that the weather was better there, so we decided to go to GuiSui to wait for the plane. The car left at 10 pm. The roadbed had just been repaired, and the car moved very slowly. After passing Mount Zhuoxian, the front of the car derailed. Fortunately, it stopped immediately, and a tragic overturning was avoided. We spent an extremely uncomfortable night in the car. The next day, GuiSui sent a car to pick us up. After a delay of eight hours, we finally arrived in the capital of Suiyuan at 5 pm on the 8th.</p>
<p>During the Battle of GuiSui last year, the soldiers and civilians of GuiSui resolutely resisted the Communist army outside the city, preserving its purity. That night, all sectors of the provincial capital held a grand banquet and a wonderful variety show, in addition to welcoming the reporter group, also welcoming several experts from the Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission and several foreign missionaries engaged in charity work. At the evening party, Provincial Government Secretary-General Yu Chunzhai, as chairman, delivered a speech saying: "The simultaneous arrival of more than 30 honored guests is an unprecedented event in GuiSui in fifteen years!" His speech included these words: "Remote and desolate Suiyuan is now on the front line of national defense. Due to insufficient material and cultural conditions, this front line needs the attention of the people of the whole country to develop, build, and strengthen it!"</p>
<p>We only stayed in GuiSui for one night. At 9 am on the 9th, we took a plane sent by Beiping back to Datong, transferred to a specially repaired plane for the south, and arrived in Nanjing at 3 pm, ending this journey. (12th)</p>
<h3>The Constitutional Processes of England, America, and France</h3>
<p>Newsroom of this Paper</p>
<p>England</p>
<p>The constitution of England can be traced back to the Magna Carta promulgated in 1215, which was produced under pressure from the aristocracy and the citizenry. According to the provisions of the Magna Carta, Parliament was established. Parliament is divided into the House of Lords and the House of Commons. Members of the House of Lords are nobles, large landowners, and court ministers. The House of Commons is organized by representatives of small and medium nobles and commoners. The House of Commons has the power to decide on various taxes, legal systems, and pass tax bills, and its power is greater than that of the House of Lords. This is the beginning of constitutional government in England.</p>
<p>Since the establishment of Parliament, conflicts have repeatedly arisen between the King and Parliament. At that time, England did not have a clear tax system, and the national treasury was not abundant, so the government came up with various new methods of collecting money, requiring Parliament to pass tax increase bills, which affected the interests of taxpayers. Parliament often opposed the government, and the government dissolved Parliament more than once. From the 13th century to the first half of the 17th century, for more than 400 years, the government repeatedly suppressed Parliament, arousing the resentment of the bourgeoisie and the middle class that made up Parliament. In 1628, Parliament presented a Petition of Right to the King. At that time, Charles I, in a hurry to have Parliament pass a new tax bill, had to agree to it. But in less than a year, Parliament was dissolved again. The King acted arbitrarily, levying taxes arbitrarily, which made the people of the whole country dissatisfied, causing the revolution of 1642.</p>
<p>The revolutionary war lasted more than 20 years. It was not until after the restoration of Charles II that the aristocracy and the bourgeoisie divided power and ruled. In 1679, Parliament passed the Habeas Corpus Act, which provided greater certainty for the protection of civil rights than before. After William III ascended the throne, in 1689, Parliament presented a Bill of Rights, which was approved by the King. The King's power was greatly restricted, while the power of Parliament was greatly increased, enough to control the government's policies. From then on, the Conservative Party, representing large landowners and nobles, and the Liberal Party, representing the emerging industrial and commercial middle class, alternately controlled the British government.</p>
<p>In 1701, the Act of Settlement was passed, stipulating the procedures for succession to the throne. In 1911, the Parliament Act was passed again, increasing the power of the House of Commons. Therefore, the British Constitution has fewer written elements and more unwritten elements.</p>
<p>America</p>
<p>On July 4, 1776, the thirteen North American states formally issued a Declaration of Independence, breaking away from Great Britain. At that time, each state had planned to establish a permanent government, but because the military was in progress, there was no time for this, and the states could not trust each other, making it difficult to achieve. It was not until 1777 that representatives of each state negotiated and adopted the "Articles of Confederation". When this plan was submitted to the states for examination and approval, there was a long debate. It was not until 1781 that it was fully passed and implemented.</p>
<p>According to the provisions of the Articles of Confederation, each state retained its sovereignty. The central government only set up a meeting, representing the states, not the people. On the central side, there were no administrative, legislative, and judicial organs to implement the laws decided in the meeting. Each state set up a governor, and the governor's power was very small. Its legislative body also adopted a bicameral system. The right to vote in each state was limited to property owners or taxpayers. After a short period of implementation, it gradually felt unsound.</p>
<p>By 1787, representatives of five states gathered to discuss a plan to reorganize the central government. As a result, a congress was convened to amend the "Articles of Confederation". In May of that year, representatives from each state gathered. This is what is historically known as the Constitutional Convention. After deliberations for four months, and after many fierce debates, the new constitution was produced in September. In 1788, it was agreed and passed by each state. After approval by the statutory number of states, it became the formal constitution of the United States one year later.</p>
<p>The slave system was originally incompatible with the spirit of American independence. The northern states abolished the slave system shortly after independence. However, the southern states believed that it was still needed for maintaining agriculture and retained it. Therefore, conflicts often occurred in Congress between free states and slave states, which finally broke out into the Civil War. In 1865, the Civil War ended. In 1866, the provisions on the rights and interests of the people in the Constitution were amended: all people who are born or naturalized are citizens. White people and slaves can also have the right to participate in politics. In 1869, Congress passed the Fifteenth Amendment to the Constitution, stipulating that people of different skin colors shall not be enslaved to deprive them of their rights. This is roughly the process of American constitution-making.</p>
<p>France</p>
<p>France initially had a "Three Estates General," representing the clergy, the nobility, and the bourgeoisie. The third estate, the bourgeoisie, had the largest number of people and the broadest scope. In 1789, when the "Three Estates General" was convened, the third estate used clever means in another venue to invite representatives from the other two estates to engage in election review. However, because the privileged representatives were arrogant and domineering, the meeting was delayed for six weeks and had not yet been held, causing dissatisfaction in the hearts of the representatives of the third estate. Therefore, the National Assembly, representing the French people, was created. This was reorganized from the third estate.</p>
<p>The conflict between the National Assembly and the King led to the French Revolution, and the Declaration of the Rights of Man was issued, indicating that the representatives of the National Assembly had made considerable guarantees for the interests of all citizens. This is an important document in European political history. However, some representatives in the third estate also supported the monarchy. They wanted to establish their new politics on top of a constitutional monarchy. In 1791, a constitution was drafted. But in 1792, the French Republic was finally established in the struggle, and those who advocated a constitutional monarchy were declared defeated. In 1793, the first constitution of the French Republic was produced. Soon this constitution was declared abolished. In 1795, another constitution was promulgated.</p>
<p>After that, France experienced Napoleon's war, the restoration of Louis XVIII, and in 1848, another revolution occurred, and the Third French Republic was established. In that year, the constitution was drawn up, and the president was elected. The new constitution of France was completed again.</p>
<p>During the Second World War, France, under the leadership of General de Gaulle, worked hard to resist Petain's puppet government under the banner of national revival. Soon, the French army returned to the territory of the motherland and established the Fourth French Republic. Feeling that the constitution formulated 50 years ago was no longer applicable, they completed their renewed constitution. This new constitution was promulgated on October 15 of this year.</p>

<h3>Things China Can Make</h3>
<p>— Editor</p>
<p>Recently, the Kensington Victoria and Albert Museum in England held an exhibition called "Britain Can Make It." The British King and Queen both visited.</p>
<p>This is similar to the National Goods Exhibition in nature and significance, except that the wording they use is broader and takes pride in what Britain can manufacture.</p>
<p>In fact, in the Chinese industrial world, there is no shortage of warriors who work hard. All products can rival imports and can even replace imports. For example, "MSG" in seasonings can replace imported flavoring powder; "Neo Salvarsan" in medicines can be replaced by "Neo Salvarsan"; "Insulin" can be replaced by "Insulin", etc. These products can be said to be the glory of Chinese industry.</p>
<p>At present, although the new pharmaceutical industry has been severely hit by the dumping of foreign goods, there are still some pharmaceutical factories that are working hard to open up new paths. For example, Xinyi Pharmaceutical Factory recently launched "Saint Lucytin New," a special medicine for treating hemophilia and kala-azar; Yang's Chemical Therapy Research Institute launched the amino acid mixture "Ponderon". This kind of action is naturally a way to seek self-survival and technical progress, but the spirit of not being afraid of hardship is worthy of praise.</p>
<p>In the future, the industrial world seems to be able to take "manufacturing things that Chinese people can make to replace imports" as the production policy.</p>
<h3>After Reading This Year's Cotton Production Estimate</h3>
<p>— Ji Junmian</p>
<p>This year's cotton production estimate has been released by the Cotton Production Advisory Committee of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry and the National Cotton Textile Industry Federation. Although it is only a preliminary estimate, it may change when the final estimate is made. However, we can see the general situation of cotton production this year from this table.</p>
<p>The figures released this time include twelve provinces, and the more famous cotton-producing areas are already included. It is estimated that there are 34,118,169 mu of cotton fields, producing 7,895,610 dan of cotton. Whether in terms of cotton field area or output, there is a trend of progress, and this progress is not slow. Because the cotton field area has increased by 40% compared with 1945, and it is still 45% worse than 1937. The output has increased by 57%, which is still 38% less than 1937. It is still a very gratifying thing.</p>
<p>This remarkable achievement is due to the efforts of all parties to promote and popularize it. It is also due to the eight years of enemy and puppet invasion, during which the people lived a hard life and lacked clothing. Once the sky was clear again, the demand for clothing was very strong and urgent, which increased the interest of cotton farmers in planting cotton. Moreover, the weather this year has not changed significantly. Although the report mentions "unfavorable weather," it is actually only local, and the disaster is light. Based on the above three factors, the increased numbers had a greater possibility, but the reasons that "fires of war were everywhere, food was lacking, and cotton farmers were unwilling to plant more cotton; and traffic was blocked, production costs were high, and production and sales were not on the right track" limited them. From these figures, we also get a slight hint - the seven provinces in East China seem to be slightly more stable than North China (only comparatively stable), so the increase in production is also greater in East China than in North China.</p>
<p>Although cotton production has increased this year, it is expected that part of it will be for the farmers' own consumption, and most of it cannot be absorbed by factories as raw materials. With foreign cotton pouring in, everyone is looking forward to the day when domestic cotton is self-sufficient, but the difference is still very far! Even if we take a step back, if we estimate the consumption of raw cotton per spindle per day and night for spinning "20-count yarn" at 1.177 pounds, then the monthly consumption is estimated at 5,707,630 pounds based on the existing number of spindles, which is 51,796 metric tons. If we calculate the number of working days in three shifts per year, we need 15,839,024 metric tons." According to this calculation, the difference between production and sales is 900,000 metric tons, only 100,000 metric tons less than last year, not to mention the consumption in the producing areas and the poor quality that does not meet the requirements for factory raw materials!</p>
<p>Assuming that the general demand for clothing this year has been initially satisfied, and the price of cotton this year cannot be in normal proportion to other grain prices, then the increase in production next year will not necessarily be smooth.</p>
<p>After reading this report and looking at the surrounding environment, we really have mixed feelings of joy and fear.</p>
<h3>The Export Problem of Chinese Products</h3>
<p>— Shadow Staid</p>
<p>The current high production costs in China are due to many factors. Inconvenient transportation and unresolved political issues all impact the export of domestic goods. The Chinese industry does not face the problem of high worker wages, yet its production costs are higher than those of other countries. This is because, for the same type of goods, the number of skilled workers used in manufacturing in China is fewer than in other countries. According to statistics before the war, the proportion of workers needed to spin 20-count yarn with 1,000 spindles was 6 in Lancashire, 6.1 in the United States, 9.3 in Japan, and 9.9 in China. For spinning 30-count yarn, it was 4 in Lancashire, 8 in Japan, and 8.5 in China. This shows that the labor cost for the same product in China is already double that of overseas. Japan's ability to compete overseas is due to the cooperation between banks, transportation companies, and yarn factories, and the slave-like work of its laborers. These are all lacking in China.</p>
<p>Therefore, if China wants to regain its pre-war overseas markets, it must train skilled workers and reduce living standards to lower production costs. The transportation problem must also be addressed to make it more efficient and convenient. The current problem of continuous inflation in China is particularly peculiar, as not only the currencies of small countries are inflating, but also the US dollar is inflating in China. This is because the prices of the two currencies fluctuate, which is an attempt to find a solution to economic problems. However, the only good policy is to improve China's foreign trade. Although many substitutes compete with Chinese goods, the prospect of exporting Chinese goods is not hopeless. First, the quality of goods must be improved. Sometimes, when Chinese goods are compared with products from other countries overseas, the difference lies not in the price but in the slight difference in quality. As for the transportation problem, the temporary suspension of some shipping routes operated by foreign merchants is due to political rather than economic reasons. China's industrial and commercial circles can wait one or two years, and things will improve.</p>
<p>In addition, the most difficult problem for China's industrial and commercial circles is the instability of the currency. The currency is constantly devaluing, making it impossible for merchants to estimate costs. This is even the case with US dollars, as the price of US dollars also fluctuates. The high trade deficit of China's foreign trade and the recent decrease in foreign tourists are also factors. In the past, they could spend a lot of money in China. Due to the current unstable political situation and inconvenient transportation, foreigners are hesitant to come to China. In any case, the obstacles to business in China today are often more political than economic. Post-war China's ability to achieve such a position in the international arena is often beyond what was imagined. Its position in world politics is particularly important. The world needs the Chinese market, and China's need for the world market is even more pressing. In the 20th century, no country can be isolated. Even the Soviet Union, whose economic structure is completely different from other countries, cannot be isolated and is trying to gain a global market. The same goes for other countries.</p>
<h3>Strange News of Production</h3>
<p>— Shao Biao</p>
<p>Twenty-five years ago, soybeans were still unknown in the West. Now, they are not only recognized as the most nutritious food in nature but also used as an industrial raw material.</p>
<p>The United States now uses soybeans to manufacture insecticides, printing inks, waterproof materials, and compounds such as oilcloth. The Ford Motor Company has even built a prototype car with most of its body made from soybean raw materials.</p>
<p>General Electric in the United States has newly invented an automatic electric temperature blanket. Two very fine electrical strips are installed in a double layer of wool. One current generates heat to warm the blanket, while the other strip measures the blanket's temperature and is connected to a three-light electronic controller, which can adjust the temperature to suit the room temperature. This type of blanket is very light and is now being mass-produced, with a price of approximately US$40 per blanket.</p>
<h3>Reasons for the Development of Industrial Technology</h3>
<p>— Xue Peng</p>
<p>The development of modern technology cannot be attributed solely to the fact that modern technology is based on scientific knowledge, but also to the respect, welcome, and reward that modern society gives to technology.</p>
<p>(1) The scientific nature of modern technology can have the following effects: A. The knowledge of technology can be easily objectified, promoting its movement and popularization. B. The knowledge of technology can be systematized, and the general causal relationship can be explored. Solving one problem becomes the key to solving other problems, and at the same time, it raises other new questions, making it easier to carry out research and development.</p>
<p>(2) Modern society welcomes and rewards technological inventions. Modern social trends are greatly interested in the development of material technology. Therefore, technological inventions and improvements are highly respected and welcomed. Those who study technology are never oppressed by society, and anyone has the freedom to research. Breaking the shackles of feudalism, establishing industrial freedom. Under the competitive system, in order to overcome its competitors, to obtain special profits, and to open up new sectors, entrepreneurs are actively welcoming and expecting new technological inventions. The most obvious manifestations are: A. Various technical education institutions, public technical research institutions, etc. B. Various research institutions and investigation and promotion institutions established by large enterprises or economic groups, etc.</p>
<p>However, under today's highly monopolized organizations, the desire for profit is often achieved by easier methods than technological improvement, that is, the welcome and encouragement of technology often slackens with the degradation of the competitive role. This is also a phenomenon that can be noted.</p>
<h3>An Introduction to Business Management</h3>
<p>— Xu Baiyi</p>
<p>Employee Psychology</p>
<p>(1) Honesty</p>
<p>In a business organization, honesty can be said to be the rejection of all external temptations and the avoidance of any actions that are harmful to the business organization, such as negligence in doing things or failing to report broken items.</p>
<p>Testing method: We can ask him for his opinion on various actions, for example:</p>
<p>A. When we are sitting on the tram and want to avoid paying for the ticket, just reading the newspaper, and the ticket seller is successfully fooled by us, is this action good or bad?</p>
<p>B. Within the company's working hours, ostensibly doing things, but in reality, deliberately slowing down the progress of work, is this action good?</p>
<p>(2) Loyalty The explanation of loyalty is very similar to honesty. The outline of a business organization for its employees is to generate labor equal to the price paid. Because laziness or wasting time is certainly not good, but extra and free work is also not required by a business organization. A staff member who can work loyally should receive a reward of promotion or salary increase.</p>
<p>Testing method: You can get his criticism of the places he has worked before by asking questions (if it is an employee who has never worked before, you can ask him how he intends to work hard or what kind of interest he feels in a certain industry)</p>
<p>Regarding the point of loyalty, on the one hand, it is still necessary to tell the employees about the various situations of the business organization at any time, such as the difficulties during the initial business, the past history, etc., verbally or in print, so that the employees can generate faith in the business organization and feel that working in it is very hopeful.</p>
<p>(3) Concentration</p>
<p>Concentration is very necessary in doing various tasks. If you do not concentrate your attention, you cannot solve the problem. When doing fine work, if you do not concentrate your attention, it is easy to make the goods substandard.</p>
<p>Testing method: Give the employees a few questions to solve. I can give a small problem published in the family as an example:</p>
<p>When Mr. Jing was about to leave Shanghai, he forgot to leave the key to the post office box. Mrs. Jing asked him for it, and he mailed it, but after a few days, Mrs. Jing asked for it again. Why is this? (Because the key mailed is still in the mailbox)</p>
<p>(4) Cooperation with colleagues</p>
<p>In many factories, the production of a product cannot be done by one person alone. It must be done by the joint cooperation of several workers. If the work of one person is not up to standard, it will be affected. Therefore, the cooperation between the various workers is very important.</p>
<p>Testing method: You can examine the previous work performance, or use the oral test method to inquire about the difficulties when working in other factories before, or why you want to leave that factory. If he says that some people could not cooperate with him before, or how others were not good, if there is this situation, then he will definitely still have that situation.</p>
<p>(5) Ambition</p>
<p>Ambition is needed by everyone. If you ask him what work he has done in order to seek his own advancement, most people will answer you that he has not done anything. This kind of person will never make progress.</p>
<p>Testing method: You can add the following questions to the form:</p>
<p>A. What do you do for entertainment in your spare time?</p>
<p>B. What books do you read in your spare time?</p>
<p>C. In which aspect are you going to work hard in the future?</p>

<h3>Preface to "Professor's Family"</h3>
<p>— Hong Shen</p>
<p>On a cold and gloomy morning in December 1943, when I was beginning to rehearse Song Zhi's play "Spring Chill" at the China Arts Theater in Chongqing, a thin, lanky young man with very limited mobility, came into the "Central Arts" rehearsal room with a letter in his hand. I saw from the letter that it was from Ma Yanxiang, requesting that I grant this author of "Professor's Family," whom I had met several times at the Youth Theater, permission to observe the rehearsals of "Spring Chill." I immediately granted permission and continued my rehearsal work.</p>
<p>At that time, Chongqing actors were becoming professionalized. They performed on stage in the evening, returned to the company at twelve o'clock for a midnight snack, or played a few rounds of "sand crabs," so when the "Spring Chill" rehearsal started at ten o'clock the next morning, Wang Jun was already there, while the actors were always late. Later, the rehearsal venue was changed to the Chongqing Youth Hall and then to the Yin Society at the entrance of Daomen. Although the actors' lateness improved, the taciturn Wang Jun always came on time to watch me rehearse. Because the actors were not punctual, while waiting for them, Wang Jun would talk to me about Chinese and Western drama, old plays and spoken drama, stage experience and playwriting, etc. From these conversations, I learned that he had a considerable understanding of the history of Chinese and Western drama and the evolution of Chinese old plays into spoken drama. Secondly, I knew that he wanted to go to France for further study, specializing in playwriting. At that time, I was teaching at Fudan University and had to go to the city to rehearse, and my friends were urging me to write "Fifty Years of Chinese Drama." Therefore, I entrusted Wang Jun to collect materials for this article. At that time, the "New Art Series" play collection that I was eagerly seeking (containing my long preface) was obtained by Wang Jun.</p>
<p>Soon after "Spring Chill" was staged, I received Wang Jun's long "Spring Chill Performance Record" of over thirty thousand words, and two plays. One was the three-act comedy "Jian Fei's Courtship," which depicted a one-armed young military officer who had won the love of a mine owner's daughter. The father always tried to obstruct them in every way, but the military officer was not discouraged and tried every means to help the mine owner solve a sabotage case, protect the mine owner's life, and eliminate the danger of sabotage, finally obtaining the mine owner's permission to marry his daughter. This is a very interesting comedy, and the author admitted that he was greatly influenced by the 17th-century British comedy writer Sheridan. The other was the one-act play "Night Scene on the Sichuan River," which depicted the story of an old woman, Zhao Dama, who selflessly rescued an abandoned child during the westward evacuation of civilians during the Anti-Japanese War. This play focuses on the rendering of the atmosphere, and from this, I knew that the author had put a lot of effort into studying the symbolist master Maeterlinck.</p>
<p>In addition, during the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, the author also wrote "When Father and Son Meet," "Professor's Family," and "Apology." "When Father and Son Meet" is the sequel to "Night Scene on the Sichuan River." When the abandoned child met his father, who was wounded in an air raid, in a Chongqing hospital, he himself was seriously ill due to malnutrition in the orphanage, and was about to die and be tragically separated from his father, along with his mother, who died of miscarriage on the boat, both victims of the enemy's invasion. "Professor's Family" attempts to portray the human habit of "the mountain is always greener on the other side of the hill" - Professor Zeng XianGuang is honest and studious, and marries Bai Yunshang, a high-status, sociable woman who does not want to be lonely. Because they do not share the same interests, XianGuang falls in love with his like-minded female teaching assistant, Ye Jinbo. Yunshang is looking for a new love with her old friend, the musician Guo Xiaocun, but Xiaocun also suspects Yunshang is having an affair with the auction house boss. When Zeng and Ye get together, and Ye is a little impatient with the research environment in the countryside, the entertainment between Bai and Guo is eliminated. The play ends with the marriage of two new couples. This three-act, one-scene play has a rather tight structure and seems to be greatly influenced by French plays. "Apology" is an interesting farce, but in terms of the profound description of the personality of the protagonist Wu Rongzhao, etc., it can also be regarded as a comedy. This play takes Chinese family education as its theme. Landlord Wu Rongzhao is tyrannical and oppressive to the farmhands and poor farmers, but flattering to his only son, apologizing whenever he is slightly disrespectful. In the end, he still cannot stop his infatuated son from going up the mountain to seek immortality.</p>
<p>Looking at the five plays in total, three comedies and two tragedies, the theme gradually tends to be profound, the characters gradually become clear, the dialogue gradually becomes vivid, and the structure gradually becomes tight. I usually advise young writers to write more comedies when starting out, because masterpieces are generally not achieved by luck. Generally speaking, comedy is more difficult than tragedy. Understanding the methods of obtaining comedic effects makes it easier to handle any play in the future. The more important of Wang Jun's five plays are all comedies, and the better ones are also comedies, which shows that the direction he is walking is correct. Judging from his cultivation of drama, his foundation is also solid. If he continues to work hard, his future is unlimited.</p>
<p>This time, "Spring Chill" is being performed again in Shanghai. With a happy mood, I would like to recommend these five plays of the author to my country's theater and the general public, although some of these plays have already met with audiences in the Great Rear Area.</p>
<h3>Poetic Words</h3>
<p>If it is poetry, no matter what form it is written in, it is poetry; if it is not poetry, no matter what form it is written in, it is not poetry.</p>
<p>Poets are loyal to their own experiences and do not write anything other than their own feelings, while those who write poetry are only arranging sentences into lines.</p>
<p>——The distinction of poets is the strictest.</p>

<h3>The Pen Nib – In Memory of a Friend's Death</h3>
<p>— Bao Yu</p>
<p>Whenever I see the stiff nib of a fountain pen, I immediately think of the death of a friend.</p>
<p>When I was editing a mimeographed newspaper on the guerrilla-held isolated island occupied by the enemy puppets, I met a colleague. His surname was Huang, he was from Shandong, and we usually called him "Little Huang" or "Little Country Bumpkin". He was very short, with a pair of black and large eyes. When he wrote articles, he always used the old Parker fountain pen he carried with him, writing and biting his fingernails at the same time. Every one of his fingers was bald and sharp, but he kept on biting, as if the inspiration for his writing was hidden in the crevices of his fingernails.</p>
<p>The newspaper was published every three days, mimeographed but printed with lead. There were only five colleagues working in the newspaper office. Although their duties were different at ordinary times, when working, they were willing to do whatever they could; especially Little Huang, in addition to assisting in editing news and writing articles, he could also receive radio broadcasts, write stencils, and sometimes even pick up a mimeograph roller to print.</p>
<p>After the newspaper was printed, in addition to being distributed to readers on the isolated island, it was also transmitted to the enemy-occupied areas by various means. One day, our newspaper actually appeared on the walls of the enemy stronghold, so the enemy and puppet troops in the entire stronghold were alarmed and uneasy. When this news reached our ears, it was like receiving the highest reward. Immediately, Little Huang composed a song. I still remember a few lines in it: "No need for pistols or bombs, only iron pens and steel stencils, no need for 'Thompson' or 'Type 38', only mimeographs and meter sticks, launch a cultural blitz, attack the enemy's hearts and livers!"</p>
<p>Several people each held a weapon - an iron pen, a meter stick, a mimeograph roller,... Little Huang held his Parker pen, which he never left his side. While holding the weapons, they sang, and later, the ink stained everyone's hands, noses, and faces. They looked at each other and laughed wildly.</p>
<p>But our newspaper only published seventy issues before it was attacked by the enemy - the enemy went to the countryside to sweep. Our village was surrounded for three days. Because of the problem of food and ammunition, we had to break through with the defending soldiers on a dark moonless night.</p>
<p>In the intense fire, three of our five colleagues broke out. One was killed halfway through; one was missing. The one who went missing was none other than Little Huang.</p>
<p>The enemy's sweep, like spilled alcohol on a tabletop, burned fiercely for a while and quickly went out. We still returned to the original location. The village had been destroyed, and half of the houses in the village had been burned down. The thatched hut used by the newspaper office was completely destroyed. But we had no time to mourn, because at that time, the most important thing was to find Little Huang. We split up to find him and found many bodies of people who had been harmed by the enemy, but Little Huang was not among them. Finally, next to a pile of straw in a half-open shed, we found his body lying on its back. His face fully expressed hatred. There were no wounds on his body, only his throat had rotted away, with a deep hole in it, but it could be seen that it was not a knife wound. A right hand without fingernails was clutching the Parker pen he was accustomed to using. The pen barrel was gone, and the tip of the pen had become rake-shaped. Blood stained his pen nib and pen barrel, his hand and body.</p>
<p>Isn't it obvious? Because he had not broken through the fire, he hid in the half-open shed. Later, the enemy rushed in. In order not to be taken prisoner, he used his great weapon - the Parker pen nib - to break his own throat and sacrifice himself heroically.</p>
<p>Our speculation was not wrong at all. This pen was his battle companion. He used his pen to tell the suffering of the people; he used his pen to expose the atrocities of the enemy; he used his pen to carry out a cultural blitz; and finally, he also used his pen to dip into the blood that gushed out of his throat to complete a great poem...</p>
<p>Little Huang was buried, and this pen was also buried with him. - Only he is worthy of using this pen!</p>
<p>From then on, whenever I see the stiff nib of a fountain pen, I think of Little Huang's death, and at the same time, I seem to see the congealed blood stains on the pen nib shining.</p>
<h3>American Modern Playwright Eugene O'Neill</h3>
<p>— Cai Xue</p>
<p>After twelve years of silence, Eugene O'Neill has a new work coming out. "The Iceman Cometh" was started before the war and will be released soon. This is a four-act play, containing nineteen characters, and must be performed for at least four hours, only half an hour shorter than his two most famous plays. The length is not a problem in his view. "As long as it's not too short to be tasteless, and not too long to be annoying," he replied. In addition to "The Iceman Cometh", he has written two new plays that have not yet been released.</p>
<p>In 1931, he took his family to the West Coast, where he lived for more than ten years, until recently, when he returned to New York. This time, he sold all his furniture and brought only some books and antiques.</p>
<p>He is thin and tall, dressed very exquisitely, with shining hair, and seems a little shy between his movements. However, his eyes are bright and shining. His conversation is sometimes melancholic, and sometimes interspersed with humor.</p>
<p>His father was the famous John O'Neill. He used to travel around with his father. He often remembers his father's words: "The drama scene now is too lifeless." Indeed, in his father's time, the characters in the play were either good or bad, with clear boundaries. "Now, when reviewing scripts," he said, "they are still inheriting this old concept, which can hinder artistic progress. What they care about is whether it will teach six or seven-year-old children badly. How do they know that there are several people among six or seven-year-old children who can teach us badly? Once, my script was seized by those review committee members, but unexpectedly, the sales of tickets greatly increased. However, those who came to see it were still irrelevant people, mostly disappointed, because this script was not as bad as they imagined."</p>
<p>He also hates the bosses in the theaters, who are unwilling to try anything more novel and only stage scripts that made money ten years ago, daring not to take risks. He believes that only those who are willing to write new scripts will study new art. After new art becomes a fashion, it will inevitably decline after reaching its peak, Impressionism being one example. The reason why "fashion" is annoying is that people who do not understand art also pretend to be artists. This is not only true of drama, but also of other kinds of art. Drama, like painting and music, has certain rules. Only those who can truly understand these rules can break them.</p>
<p>He believes that movies are harmful to drama. Hollywood has snatched away all the people who can act. Playwrights, wanting Hollywood to buy their scripts, inevitably cater too much to their tastes. He said he is not against movies and likes to watch them very much. But when writing a script, one must never intend to leave room for future adaptation into a movie. Writing a script and writing a movie are two different arts. Adapting a play into a movie is the business of filmmakers, not playwrights.</p>
<p>Radio also has its scope and does not need to be mixed with drama.</p>
<p>O'Neill was born in New York and is now fifty-eight years old. He entered school at the age of seven and was expelled from Princeton University for misconduct. He wandered around South and North America, and his accomplishments were nothing. Finally, he returned to New York and acted with his father. Because of his poor health, he went to a hospital to recuperate. He began to write scripts out of loneliness and boredom and became famous for it.</p>
<p>He said that he is most afraid of watching the scripts he has written himself. The actors often cannot express what he has in mind, even going in the opposite direction. Only Charles. Corbin's portrayal of Minter in "King John" could meet his intention.</p>
<p>After the outbreak of the war, because the outside world was too disturbed, he could not concentrate on writing. He does not use a typewriter and does not like dictation, so the manuscripts are all handwritten.</p>

<h3>An Inch of Mountain, An Inch of Blood 96</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>"Could it be that the powder magazine was blown up?" Tiger Brother guessed.</p>
<p>"Powder magazine?" I recalled the situation in the gasoline tank area. "That's unlikely. The oil drums and tank were separated from the powder magazine by six or seven zhang." I tried my best to consider the possibility of this matter.</p>
<p>"If not, could it be that the Japanese devils used bombs to extinguish the fire?" Tiger Brother applied his highest knowledge and intelligence to make a second guess.</p>
<p>"Even more unlikely..." I explained, "Using bombs to extinguish a fire is also a possible method, but judging from the sound, this bomb was at least one or two thousand pounds, or even more. When it exploded, even places several miles away here felt the tremors... I'm afraid they don't have such a big bomb here."... (The reporter's recollection of the group's report ends here).</p>
<p>As Qun finished speaking, I (the reporter) interjected, telling those present, "This matter will never be truly understood. But I do have a guess: I think it was a landmine that the Japanese devils had buried underground beforehand that exploded. I know that in some important areas, they often bury landmines in advance. Once they suffer a defeat and don't have time to transport important materials away, they use electricity to detonate the landmines to destroy the things. Foreigners also have this habit. I just don't know if this explosion was caused by the gasoline fire being too strong and detonating the landmine, or if they detonated it themselves with electricity. This can only remain a secret forever."</p>
<p>I also asked Qun and Little Tiger how they came back. Yaoqun said that when they reached the section near where Sister Cui lived, it was already past eleven o'clock. They found the car they had hidden. Because of the Shuanglong incident, there were too many Japanese devil sentry cars on the highway searching back and forth, so they dared not take to the road. They hid in the fields and waited for more than half an hour before driving back.</p>
<p>While we listened to Yaoqun telling this story, we continued to receive reports of battles on the front lines. The situation at various positions of our army was bad. In Tong County, there were only a little over a thousand "Security Team" members, and two or three battalions of undisciplined puppet troops. How could they possibly hold out? At the same time, we also received an order from the Beiping Action Headquarters to evacuate urgently, so the temporary commander here immediately ordered all comrades to prepare for evacuation and post-evacuation work.</p>
<p>I also told Yaoqun and Hucheng about Hejian calling me, asking me to move the secretariat to Shanxi, and then asking me to rush to Tokyo. When the two of them heard this, Hucheng's big, round eyes immediately shone with a strange light, as if eager to try it out, while Yaoqun lowered his head, with a look of deep melancholy and sadness.</p>
<p>When our group left the city, the south of the city was already ablaze with fire. The Japanese devils had launched a major counterattack and were advancing into the city. It seemed that the mountains and rivers that these thousands of brave soldiers had shed blood to recapture would once again fall into the hands of the enemy. The streets along the way were silent as death. Under the dim and unclear lamplight, the flags of the Blue Sky with a White Sun still hung in front of every house. Perhaps the tens of thousands of pure and kind people were still celebrating the restoration of their motherland in their dreams! (End of Chapter 5)</p>

<h3>U.S. Dollars</h3>
<p>— Shaofu</p>
<p>Every time there is a political change, the financial market in Shanghai becomes very sensitive and stirs up trouble. This time, the wild jump in the U.S. dollar was not due to rumors in this regard, but due to the absurd rumors that foreign exchange would be loosened. It must be said that speculators' ability to use market psychology to fabricate stories is very clever and impressive.</p>
<p>On the surface, we who do not have U.S. dollars in hand and do not use U.S. dollars do not seem to have much to do with its rise and fall; however, in reality, it is closely related to other commodity prices (for example, this time the U.S. dollar rose, and the price of gold also rose accordingly), and we who do not have Citibank tickets are completely harmed by it.</p>
<p>The sky is covered with layers of gray clouds, and in the north wind, we hear the two-person band hired by some shops playing. The monotonous music makes people feel very sad. This is a symbol. Industry and commerce are currently at the most difficult juncture, and they really can't stand the stimulus of any disturbance.</p>
<p>Speaking of U.S. dollars, it is said that the United States prints an average of 35 million U.S. dollars in banknotes every day. The smallest denomination is one dollar, and the largest denomination is one hundred thousand dollars. The banknote printing company is located in Washington, D.C., and has a staff of 7,000 people. The raw material for banknote paper is 50% cloth and 50% cotton. Regarding this point, I wonder if friends who do U.S. dollar business know about it?</p>

<p>The "nutrition expert" claims to be "naturally deficient and acquiredly imbalanced", so he is sallow and emaciated, and his mind and body are exhausted. Recently, he has been losing sleep every night due to worrying about the country and lamenting the times. Under such circumstances, he feels that his health is too bad; therefore, he tells everyone he meets: "My body is about to collapse!"</p>
<p>Just like the doctor in "Chongqing Twenty-Four Hours" (a famous anti-Japanese war drama) said: "The body is too bad, the nutrition is too poor!" This "nutrition expert" imitates those two lines whenever he meets someone.</p>
<p>Very few people know the original name of "Nutrition Expert" (as we call him). Long before victory, we gave him the "elegant name" of "Nutrition Expert" by common consent. He really knows too much about nutrition. He spends all day holding books such as "Vitamins and Nutrition", and even when eating a peanut, he makes a big fuss, saying that the peanut skin is rich in nutritional value and should not be discarded; however, other people eat peanuts without any problems, but as soon as he eats peanuts, he immediately gets stomachaches, intestinal noises, and all kinds of diseases.</p>
<p>He has two thermometers, one for measuring the climate and one for measuring body temperature. When looking at the climate thermometer, he advocates opening windows or not and covering himself with how many quilts, and must first look at the indoor thermometer before deciding; he also decides how many clothes to wear in the morning in this way. Occasionally, he feels abnormal, and he must drink a lot of boiled water and sit quietly to rest, but sitting quietly and contemplating only increases his mental anxiety. Therefore, he always feels that the discomfort in his body is becoming more and more serious; he immediately looks in the mirror again, counts his pulse, and suddenly feels that a serious illness is coming. He feels that he must have an X-ray and a blood test, so he immediately runs to the doctor. The doctor knows that he is a "mechanical hygienist" and can only lightly give him some digestive medicine and tell him to exercise more, but he says: "Someone as weak as me can only take a walk and should not do strenuous exercise!" The doctor smiles helplessly.</p>
<p>When he returns home, he feels that the doctor is too irresponsible. He looks in the mirror again and suddenly feels that his complexion has improved, with a slight red glow in the pale white, but then he thinks again! No, that's probably a fever. Isn't it exactly one o'clock in the afternoon on the clock? It's probably the early stage of TB and he's having a "Noon-Fever". He feels infinite sadness, as if nothing in the world belongs to him. He mutters to himself: "I should get a calcium shot, I should eat more of the best cod liver oil pills. So he took out a "Haivita" pill from his pocket, then breathed fresh air in front of the window and rested for a few minutes. He suddenly felt better and coughed up some phlegm. After examining it carefully, he found no blood streaks in the phlegm, and his nerves gradually calmed down.</p>
<p>In the evening, he designs: What kind of dinner is the most perfect "vitamin" meal in the world? He tells the nanny: "You must put some tomatoes, cream, pig liver... in every bowl of vegetables, and it can't be too cooked, otherwise, the vitamins will be burned to death! However, the bacteria in the vegetables must be killed!" This makes the nanny, who has not received "nutrition and health education", completely confused. After dinner is served, he doesn't want to eat it, probably because the "Halivita" cod liver oil pill is too strong and can't be digested; this makes him even more panic. He flips through the book "Ways to Maintain Health", which says that vitamins B and C help digestion, so he decides to inject vitamins B and C again.</p>
<p>He talks about nutrition every day and pays attention to health all the time, but the result is that he has "no way to make a living" and "no way to treat illness". Mr. "Nutrition Expert" frowns at the mirror, and the doctor shakes his head with a smile.</p>
<p>Childishness and hypersensitivity have destroyed the health of the nutrition expert!</p>
<h3>Many Tricks of Swindlers</h3>
<p>— Xiuju</p>
<p>Now there are endless scams in Shanghai, which are really increasing. If you are not careful, you will be greatly fooled. The other day was my brother's wedding day, held at the Kangle Restaurant, with guests filling the hall, a harmonious and lively atmosphere. Yesterday, all the congratulatory gifts from the guests, including cash, gift certificates, and bank drafts, were sent to Shanghai ×× Bank, but two of the ×× Qianzhuang 50,000 yuan bank drafts, signed ×××, were returned. Everyone was very surprised and hurriedly flipped through the gift register, which showed that Mr. Huang ×× had sent a bank draft for 100,000 yuan. My father immediately became suspicious, saying that he had no contact with Mr. Huang ×× and did not know him, so he immediately realized that this person must have sent it when the wedding ceremony was held at Kangle Restaurant, while the host, the groom, and the bride were entering the hall. Because at that time, all the hosts and managers were surrounding the stage in the main hall watching the wedding ceremony, and there were several managers and the like left at the accounting table. Because this person used the name of Mr. Huang ××, the manager thought that my father had contact with Mr. Huang, so he issued a 10,000 yuan tip without thinking. Who knew that this draft was an expired draft from the pseudo-organization? This person waits every day for weddings to be held in larger halls, then sends tens of thousands of yuan of fake drafts as congratulatory gifts, and can collect tens of thousands of yuan in tips in a day, which is much easier than borrowing or begging from people! But the swindled people are greatly troubled by it. Therefore, gentlemen who hold happy events in the future, especially the managers sitting at the accounting table, please pay special attention and do not let these cheaters be complacent again.</p>
<h3>Impossible to Go to Bed Early</h3>
<p>— Jianhua</p>
<p>At the Shanghai Municipal All Circles Economy Movement Committee, during the standing committee meeting the day before yesterday, Mayor Wu suggested that everyone go to bed early and get up early to save electricity. The benefits of going to bed early and getting up early have been explained in detail by educators and health experts, and are known to women and children, so there is no need for lengthy descriptions here.</p>
<p>However, the night in the city does not allow citizens to go to bed early. The staff in the newspaper offices, of course, cannot go to bed early; the teachers in the schools, in order to grade papers and prepare teaching materials, are afraid that it is also difficult to go to bed early; even the important officials in politics, because of indispensable banquets and social engagements, or consultations on important matters, have to sacrifice their early bedtime to deal with a late night.</p>
<p>Speaking of the industrial and commercial circles, they have worked hard all day, and everyone wants to go to bed early, but the sound of mahjong next door, the noise, the sound of wireless broadcasts, the sound of jeep horns, etc., are more powerful than the call of educators and health experts to advocate going to bed early, and ultimately make you unable to sleep, resulting in everyone developing the habit of going to bed late. As for the general poor class and the unemployed masses, they are planning for tomorrow's firewood, rice, oil, and salt, and are worried and anxious, so they can't sleep even more. Now, there are fewer and fewer people who can enjoy the happiness of going to bed early in this year.</p>
<p>We sympathize with Mayor Wu's suggestion, and we understand the significance of going to bed early and getting up early for physical health, but how to get a comfortable early sleep has simply become an unsolvable social problem in the city. I think there is absolutely no fool in the world who "has the good fortune but doesn't enjoy it, and sits and waits for dawn."</p>
<p>The Story of a Psychoanalyst</p>
<h3>The Innocent Murderer 6</h3>
<p>— Xu Guiting</p>
<p>"She told us to look for you," said the police chief.</p>
<p>"Is Lussan himself there?"</p>
<p>"We haven't found him yet. He escaped."</p>
<p>"Can you help us?" the police chief asked. "I think he must have gone mad."</p>
<p>"Yes, he suffers from schizo-epilepsy. No one can ever predict what such a nerve patient will do. He may not remember what he did himself, and he won't be able to tell that he has done wrong."</p>
<p>The police chief then took Mien and introduced him to Dr. Hailing. Hailing said, "I have managed to anesthetize her nerves, so she won't feel much pain now. If you want to talk to her, now is the time."</p>
<p>Mien thought that Mrs. Lussan, sleeping in bed, must be beautiful, petite, and brave. Unexpectedly, just the opposite, she became very ugly, shrunk up like a dwarf. A pair of dark eyes darted back and forth until Mien came in before stopping.</p>
<p>Mien said, "Hey, Mrs. Lussan! What have they done to you?"</p>
<p>Mrs. Lussan was silent for a long time before whispering, "Dr. Mien, what will happen to Adam in the future? I think I'm going to die eventually. So, what's the best thing to do? He will always be unable to escape the law."</p>
<p>"He will definitely be fine, I will take care of him."</p>
<p>Her face gradually relaxed, and her voice was clearer than before, saying, "That's great. You must explain it to them, otherwise they won't understand. You must declare to them that you can cure him. I am indeed a fool for not taking good care of him. I didn't know that he would actually hide a pistol."</p>
<p>"Dr. Mien, we don't know how we can get some money. We have never had any money. It shouldn't be a problem for you, right?"</p>
<p>"No problem, I will take care of Adam. You go to sleep."</p>
<p>Mien walked out of the room with Dr. Hailing. When he reached the door, he whispered to Hailing, "You take care of her, I can't find a single clue."</p>
<p>Hailing patted Mien's arm and said, "Goodbye."</p>
<p>When Mien returned home, he saw that the consulting room was still lit. Lussan and his wife, Polly, were sitting opposite each other by the fireplace. They stood up at the same time. Polly smiled and said to her husband, "Hey, my love! We've been waiting for you for a long time!"</p>
<p>Mien immediately interjected, "Hey, Lussan!"</p>
<p>Lussan smiled slightly, but did not say anything. He was wearing a black evening dress, and he looked very tall and handsome. Polly said, "Mr. Lussan came here to return a cane to you."</p>
<p>"Oh, you finally returned it to me, you little thief," Mien said.</p>
<p>"That's right, the cane is already in the living room." Lussan said indifferently, "I'm really sorry to trouble Mrs. Mien, but she is the most amiable and understanding person. I think Mrs. Mien must now understand my difficulties, right?"</p>
<p>Mrs. Mien smiled and said, "Of course, I understand your difficulties."</p>
<p>Lussan then continued very self-importantly, "I came here specially to tell this annoying story to Mrs. Mien, because maybe I will be gone before you come back. You certainly know that I have killed women. Although some other people may think of other things about me, I think you should know, because I often want to know..."</p>
<p>"Of course," Mien interrupted, "I want to know everything about you. Well, are you still carrying that pistol?"</p>
<p>"Yes," Lussan replied, while putting his hand into the right pocket of his coat.</p>
<p>"Then, please hand it over to me, okay?"</p>
<p>"That's not very important," Lussan replied.</p>
<p>Mien had no choice but to shrug his shoulders and say indifferently, "Okay, Polly, since you've already heard the story, you'd better go to sleep. It's not early anymore." After finishing speaking, he turned to Lussan and said, "Polly, go away, let's talk, you probably don't mind, right?" (To be continued)</p>
<p>General Knowledge Quiz</p>
<h3>Pencil, Camphor Balls, Aluminum Pot - What Are They Really?</h3>
<p>— Ding Yichang</p>
<p>Not long ago, didn't some people argue over the meaning of the two terms "civil war" and "internal strife"? "Rectifying names" is an important matter, but in our daily lives, there are many nouns that we often mistakenly use without realizing it. For example, "celluloid" is called "chemistry," a new type of man-made fiber is called "glass," and another type of transparent "plastic" product, such as combs, is also called "glass"... The names are so terribly wrong.</p>
<p>The following ten questions are all similar propositions. Even if we can't change our tongues for a while due to habit, at the very least, we should understand the background in our hearts.</p>
<p>I think: people with a middle school level of natural science knowledge should be able to answer more than seven questions correctly in ten minutes without any effort. The answers will be published in this column tomorrow.</p>
<p>1 We often use "pencils" to write, what do you think the black "lead core" in the middle of this pencil is made of?</p>
<p>A Is it really metallic lead, somewhat like the lead used for printing lead characters? B Is it lead oxide?</p>
<p>C Or is it metallic graphite, like the black stuff inside dry batteries?</p>
<p>2 As the end of autumn and the beginning of winter approaches, we should put away our summer clothes. Okay, let's put a few "foreign camphor balls" (or "mothballs") in the clothes box to repel moths. These "foreign camphor balls" are white in color and have a spicy odor. What do you think they are manufactured from:</p>
<p>A Refined camphor oil?</p>
<p>B "Naphthalene" extracted from coal tar?</p>
<p>C Or, the sediment or residue of Western peppermint?</p>
<p>3 The dazzling diamonds on the hands of noble women, in terms of composition, what do you think this diamond worth billions is:</p>
<p>A Almost exactly the same as the charcoal burned in a charcoal stove?</p>
<p>B The same as cat's eye stone?</p>
<p>C Or, the same as a certain ingredient contained in the luminous characters on a luminous watch?</p>
<p>4 High-end metal Western tableware, auto parts, lamp decorations, eyeglass rims, or some shiny silver-like ornaments on women's bodies... many people say that they are all plated with "chromium," what kind of metal is "chromium" anyway? Is it:</p>
<p>A Western silver or nickel?</p>
<p>B An alloy of silver?</p>
<p>C Or, chromium?</p>
<p>5 Buy a pack of aluminum foil paper cigarettes and smoke them, there is always a silver-white metal foil "paper" wrapped around the cigarette rolls in the paper box, many people call it "aluminum foil paper," but what do you think it is:</p>
<p>A Aluminum foil?</p>
<p>B Tin foil?</p>
<p>C Or, is it really a thin sheet of aluminum?</p>
<p>6 Then, let me ask another question: what is the origin of the gold-colored "gold powder" that is printed on the pattern of the cigarette pack? Is it:</p>
<p>A Green steel powder?</p>
<p>B Purple steel powder?</p>
<p>C Or does it contain a low-gold metal powder with one ten-thousandth gold?</p>
<p>7 That's right, some cigarette pack patterns are printed not with gold "gold powder", but with silver "silver powder", then, what do you think this "silver powder" is originally:</p>
<p>A Aluminum powder?</p>
<p>B An alloy powder of silver and nickel?</p>
<p>C The name "silver cinnabar" will not be unfamiliar to us. It is a red pigment, and sometimes it is also called "cinnabar" and used as a medicinal material. What do you think its composition is:</p>
<p>A Mostly contains silver compounds?</p>
<p>B Contains a small amount of sand compounds?</p>
<p>C Or is it a sulfide of mercury (i.e. mercury)?</p>
<p>9 In modern family kitchens, there is always a set of so-called "aluminum pots" that are lovely silver-white in color and very light to pick up. What do you think this metal should be called:</p>
<p>A "Antimony"?</p>
<p>B "Aluminum"?</p>
<p>C Or "special steel"?</p>
<p>10 Most stores in big cities are equipped with new-style rod-like fluorescent tubes. Shanghai people commonly call them "daylight tubes". What do you think a more appropriate name should be:</p>
<p>A "Fluorescent tube" or "cold light tube"?</p>
<p>B "Sun lamp"?</p>
<p>C Or, should it still be called "daylight tube" as it has been?</p>
<p>Answers will be revealed tomorrow</p>
