<p>〔本報南京十六日電〕糧食部徐部長，十六日下午五時接見本報記者，發表談話如下：本年國內各地秋收大都豐稔，糧價普遍跌落，但因（一）經八年以上之長期抗戰，農村所受損害極大，短期內尙未回復原狀；（二）上年受災各地，因人工，獸力，肥料，種于均甚缺乏，耕種並未普遍；（三）有若干產糧特豐之地區，目前糧食尙被封鎖或燬壞，交通亦被破壞或阻碍，糧食之流通尙難回復盈虛相濟之常態；（四）在戰前歷年海外糧食入口之平均數約一百六十萬噸，即在豐收之年，亦在一百萬噸左右。基於上述四點，故今後糧食情况，切盼國內交通迅可恢復，俾有餘或不足各地，均得相當之調劑，復盼國外之米，麥，麵粉如期源源運入，充裕民食，至今後數月，爲糧價下落之季節，各地糧價仍將繼續跌落，深盼工資及一般物價均能同等下跌，則經濟狀况必大可改觀矣。</p>

<p>〔本報南京十六日電〕馬特使偕夫人，將於十七日離牯返京，首都政浩活動，將待馬使下山後，始能定其動向·十六日上午十時半，中共代表團王炳南曾訪司徒大使，王吿以目前戰况嚴重，有急待召開軍事三人小組會議，從速商討停戰必要。並稱：若以非正式五入小組會議循政治途徑而進，則不易獲得解決目前危急局面之最有效辦法。司徒大使則以爲，目前軍事問題自屬嚴重，然如不從政治途徑着手，而達成停戰之目的，則所謂「停戰」，仍非久遠之計，大使仍以召開非正式五人小組會議爲當前適常辦法，王於十二時離去。十一時國府皮參事宗敢亦往訪大使，皮語記者，此來乃半公半私，因皮曾帶其公于同行也。十一時廿分，皮氏親自駕車而去。下午四時半，張厲生訪司徒大使，下午五時吳鐵城亦至，與大使進行晤談時，皮宗敢亦在座，至下午六時三刻陸續離去，聞談話內容爲司徒大使首先吿以與王炳南談話情形，旋彼此交換意見，大使似亟欲覓一妥當辦法，以推進此和平商談。</p>

<p>（二）我們於此更不能對於今日國內之黨派問題，披瀝其坦白懇切的意見。</p>
<p>我們認為共產主義的理想我們所信仰三民主義中之民生主義，只在於哲學基礎與實現方法的不同，而欲改造此經濟畸形的社會，使成為經濟平等，大家共同的社會，則目的并無二致；但是馬克思主義產生於工業革命後，資本主義流毒滋深之西洋社會，其不能過用於工業落成之中國，已為一切中外有人士所公認。至於中國共產黨的言行不符，更屬顯而易見。共產黨從前呼抗日，而實則利用抗日時機，發展其勢力；高呼圑結，而實則企區割地盤，破壞我國的統一；今日高呼民主，而實則在其所開解放區內行階級獨實則自進攻綬，侵略東北，乃至進攻大同，從無一刻停止其略地攻城的野心，與禍過國殃民之妄行，我們真不明白他們是何居心。我們所尤其絕對反對的，是中國共產黨教人不要愛國。教人要消減人性的荒認主張。很明肴的共產黨是漠視國家的利益，不惜打學我國的國際地位，消我們民族自尊心的，中華民族固有的道德，是在於忠孝仁愛倌義和平，中國所以能抵察日本強冠。獨得最騰利者，絕非由於科學或組織之騰於數人，而實由我們祖先消留種種因有道德民族精神的潛力，中國共產黨竟不惜加以無情的破壞。無論任何國家，任何民族，立國於今日之世界尤必需國民具有獨立自由之精神，而中國共產黨於國家民族最實貴文化還產，又不惜加以無情的摧壞。不僅我們三民主義青年所堅決反對。就是全國各階層的青年，甚至己經加入中國共產黨的青年，　也不一定不忍受。</p>
<p>我們所始終期待於中國共產黨的，是他們遵守抗戰初期願意護蔣委員長，顧意為三民主義之澈底實現而門的諾言，推行國家化，將他們的武力統編為國家的軍事，為合法的政黨，以促成黨政的實施。如果他們能夠把社會主義的政綢，爭取國民的同情，督促政府的實行，那末我們三民主義的青年，原以實行民生主義為大職，并不要加以反對，道是本於我們的天良和我們的理智，要求中國共產黨的許多青年，要加以深刻的考虎，不要受少數野心家的麻醉，更不要受黑暗暴力的卻持而誤國自誤，這樣才算得是一個中華民國的青年，才不愧為黃帝的子孫。</p>
<p>此外我們也顧意在此一述我們反對於中國共產黨以外其他黨派的意見，我們認為依照三民主義的大道和國父革命我國的宏規，到了政實施的時候，無論任何黨派，只要不達反三民主義，不區謀危害民國，都可獨得合法的存在保障。三民主義張國家為人民所共有，政治為人民所共享。在此世紀的政治思潮當中，此種日月經滅的主張，自必為一切有開明思想的人士所護，絕沒有一個光明正大的政黨，會反對三民主義根本主張的道理。現在各黨派所襟揭之政綢。雖不無若干的差別，實在都沒有能夠脫離三民主義的范圑。中國民黨既有五十年舉行三民主義革命救國的光榮歷史，即今日中華民國家莫大的貢獻。在此中國國民黨正領遵全國國民抵抗日本帝國主義利的時候，又是要提前結果朝政，實施政府的時候，各黨派人士都具有愛國的天良。自必珍視國民黨過去的苦心，接受國民黨顧各黨派忠誠合作的誠意，以達成和平建國之目的。如果把黨派利益放在國家利益之上，把政黨道德放在政黨力量之下，就不是政治家應有的風度，尤其是民主政治的政黨，必須要有獨立自主的精神，及光明磊落的能度，不可認為共產黨的外圑，徒為共產黨張目，如果其內容精神上受共產黨的操緃裹，而無法自主，其行勳言論受共產黨的支配主使，而修失其獨立的宗旨，那就不合今日民主政治的精神，我們三民主義的青年不傼他們惋惜，也實在對他們失望。</p>
<p>（三）本於上棕國內情熱和國內各黨派的，我們要述我們三民主義的信仰，和我們對於目前國事的主張。</p>
<p>我們深深地相信，三民主義不但是救中國的大道，而且是全人類生活改造的真理。還是一個主義是人道主義出發，以全人類的生存為荔點。探求一切自由平等博愛的精神。更加以科學的思想為指遵而得來的。三民主義是民族主義的國家，民主義的政治，和平民主義的經濟三者的綜合。我們三民主義者，當然反對法西斯主義帝國議，不能贊同根塚唯物議而來的主張階級獨戰而忽略政治自由的共產共義我們認定要拯救今紛亂的中國，衹有屬守三民主義，力行三民主義，同樣要挽救今日紛亂的世界，也祇有根據三民主義的原理，繼能把人類經濟，政治，民族，三大問題求得合理的解決。先說國際。我們主張要忠實遵守聯合國大篇章，以聯合全求各國，把戰各種急待解決的問題，作正本清源一榮永逸的解決。凡是企國用強大的武力，宰制世界，以及還反種族平等，人民自由，經濟互相的一切落伍的思想，都不應使之存在，中國當此紛亂之局，該地掦我中華民族崇尙正義公理的一貫精誠，履行我聯合國一律的義務，以佔進友邦的合作，以貫澈我們共同作戰的目標，以杜絕強政治的復活，即以永久弭止戰爭的再起需要的三民主義，我們憑籍的力題，是四萬萬五千萬國民的同民一致，我們要堅決的為實現一個真理而奮門。</p>
<p>次說國內，我們認定今日中國，已進入政實施的一個親時代，是全國國民完成國的前夕，也是艱離創造的開始，政府為謀和平建國，召開各黨派政治協商會議所共同決定的和平建國綢領等，必須全國誠意的履行，以達全國所望的和平統一民主的目的。</p>
<p>但是我們要沉痛指出的，就是抗戰勝利已滿一年了，為什麼同胞的痛苦，反而加深，國家的憂思，反而加重，勝利的光輝日見黯淡，而抗戰犧牲的軍民先烈，得不到安慰，這種恥辱現象的造成，實在是由於我們國家的統一遭受了威脅，建國的計劃未能實現，亦由於三民主義未能實行的緣故。因此我們要喚起全國同胞切實認識：（一）擁護統一，（二）實行建國的必要，更要督促政府善盡其實行三民主義的職責。</p>
<p>第一：我們必須擁護國家統一，是立國必備的要件。是社會安定和人民自由的保障，也是實行民主建國的前提。我們政治是的抗戰結束的時候，就揭　和平，統一安定三大目標，苦心努力，以期用和平商談的方法，使中國共產黨放棄其武裝割據分裂國家的企圖，達成國家眞正的統一，政府這一貫政策，正是全國同胞迫切的祈求，更是我們全國青年所一致擁護的；但是這一年以來，商談盡管在繼續進行，而共產黨始終堅持他自擁隊軍，封建割據的觀念，不斷攻擊國軍，擴大地盤，必欲將國家軍令政令的統一破壞無餘，造成「國家以內更有國家」，「國軍以外更有軍隊」的現象，乃至交通節節被切斷，經濟處處被割裂，復員和救濟工作，無法進行，長此以往，不但民不聊生，而且國將不國，我們為保持勝利的成果，維護國家的生存，我們全體青年，應不惜犧牲自由，犧牲生命，犧牲一切，保障國家的統一，認定今日救國之迫，對於破壞統一的行為，我們全國青年必圑結全民族的意志和力量，發揮公意而加以制裁。</p>
<p>第二：我們必須實行建國方略，抗戰建國，本是同時並進的國策，緊接著抗戰勝利，建國就應該立即開始，過去一年來，經蹉跎躭誤，萬不能再有遷延，我們全國上下務必竭盡全力，排除萬難，以加緊建設工作的進行。（下文轉入第三版）</p>

<h3 id="c37">莫洛托夫的驚人演說 <a href="#c37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>美國華萊土演說所引起國際問的激厲踢盪方漸國復平靜的時候，蘇聯外長莫洛托夫又在巴黎和會的義大利政治及領土委員會席上，發表他麾時逾六十分鐘的路人演說。此一演說雖在外表上是為的特港問題，但牽涉到的箣围甚廣，弦外之音，不雖體味。如關於否決榴問題，莫氏則說：排斥或摒絕否決確，有助於企圖樹立英美集國之人。倘欲和平而漠視蘇聯，實為危險之事。聯合國倘欲保衙和平而無蘇聯參加，甚至欲反對蘇聯，定必失敗。一切企圖，凡以摒絕否決梩為目的者，應視為新戰爭而加以拒絕。又謂：十九世紀之民主政治原則己不適於二十世紀，例如希聨典保加利亞己形成兩種不同的民主形式，希騰還舉會發生舞弊及外國干涉，但保加利亞之公民投票，蘇聯絕未施以壓力。可知莫氏的演說，跡近一種管詞的挑戰。此為莫氏自莫斯科返抵巴黎以後的首次演說，其意義自梩深長。</p>
<p>問於特港部份，莫氏主張和會應摒華英·美·或法國之草案，完全采納蘇聯的計劃，其要點為：（一）劃特港自主區為中立及非武裝地帶；（二）所有外國軍隨應於對義和約生效後三十日內撤離特港自主區；（三）特港自主區在經濟上應典南斯拉夫打成一片；（四）自主區政府應由該區人民議會負責其責任；（五）該區內之義大利人，除支持義大利法西斯政權者，會為法西斯黨官員者，會服務於義警察者，一九二一年以後自義來該區之政府官吏以及戰犯外，均准其取得該區公民種；（六）由英·美·蘇·法組織盟國委員會，俟和約生效，即組織該自主區之區時政府時，並應徵取當地民主圑體黨派之意見；（七）區時政府之特別責任，在限令於三個月內舉行人民議會之異緊，組成該自由區之正式政府。此一計劃，表面上的確光明正大，但還裹却蘰蓄有如下的問題；（1）自主區的存在沒有時聞的規定，舆英·美·法所提之折草案規定為十年者不同；（2）此一自主區之產生典存在將完全脫離聯合國機構的節制；（3）該區義大利人民公民繼之取得有諜道些限制，不管取消成千成萬義大利人的公民謀，此其結果，將使南斯拉夫人在該區取得控制權，加以此項辦法沒有時間的規定·民還的議會又為最高決策機問，則此蘇聯計劃產的民還議會成立以後，很可能通過法案，將特港自主區聯併南斯拉夫，故深究其眞義，此項計劃似為南斯拉夫大形方便之問。在客觀的第三者看來，關係徵妙復雜的特港問題，如循此計劃進行解決，決不如索性將該區劃聯南斯拉夫來得乾脆。</p>
<p>我們不能否認莫洛托夫蓮策演說，充滿活力的表現，還典華萊土演懦弱舞力，呈謀槿有趣的對照。綜觀莫氏演說的全文，其要點是在</p>
<p>威脅一般懦弱的人，迫使他們無條件接受蘇聯的一切政策。莫氏身為蘇聯外長，而於其演說中，一再提起英法各國，英美集國，一若那些資本主義的國察果貭在樹立什反蘇等國者；要計劃到民主制度，莫氏更老實不資氣的說祇有蘇聯的制度繼是澈底現代化之民主政治，可施行於其他國家，而英國的民主觀念己為陳腐。凡此所言，如果在納綷和決西斯打倒以前，出之於德義宣傅部長之口，也未必不是大同小異吧！</p>
<p>莫洛托夫提起了他所痛恨的慕尼黑協定，自然大家都要切記處的，不過人們也許要蓮帶同想到歐州第二次大戰爆發的前夕，德蘇不侵犯協的簽訂。如果慕尼黑協定是放緃了納綷瘋狗，則莫洛托夫與李賓特羅甫所簽訂的莫斯科協定，豈不更將是嗾使瘋狗咬人？算了罷，大家不必算這筆臭帳，還是誠心誠意的提携合作，共同締造世界和平，為最上上策。</p>
<p>莫洛托夫的演說，更坦白地指出一點，就是世界和平的維繫，必須接受蘇聯的觀點，這就是「蘇維埃和平」Pax　Sovietica。換言之，所有舆蘇聯觀點不同的政策均應放開，而蘇聯合的觀點，纔是道理。還眞是以蘇維埃為中心的「世界統治」。在犧牲了無數生命而羸得的和平，倘使就是建築基礎於這種Pax　Sovictica之上，則在太平洋荒島上，北非的沙漠上，諾曼地的海灘上，以及整個中國戰場上的英魂，必將揮淚。這是一個需要決定的時代！人類也正逢著一個歷史新階段的前夕！</p>
<h3 id="c38">要求收回香港的決議 <a href="#c38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>上海市參議會昨日大會一貫通過決議，請求政府交涉收回香港澳門及其他因不平等條約而割讓或租借之領土。這一個決議案，不僅可以代表上海四百萬人民的意見，也可以代表我全國四萬萬人民共同一致的願望！</p>
<p>中國與各國從前所訂的不平等條約，以鴉片戰爭後的南京條約為嚆矢，而香港之割讓即為南京條約之產物，與五口通商同。故收回割讓及租借之領土，應以香港為始。</p>
<p>英國應將香港九龍歸還中國，不論在法理上或在實際上，均為義不容緩之舉。在大戰期間，中英美三國巨頭，在開羅會晤，共商遠東百年大計時，在原則上曾一致同意，將香港九龍歸還中國。美國參議員且曾為英國不肯輕言放棄香港，而加以抨擊；即在英國當局，也曾表示，一俟時機成熟，當即與中國進行談判，討論香港歸還的問題。英國新任駐華大使施締文，自英啓程來華履新時，也曾鄭重表示：「英國在華，除商業而外，別無其他任何野心；亟願中國成為強大安定統一的國家。英國政府當在最大可能範圍內，盡力恊助中國，務使中國成為強大而統一的國家。」大家都以為隨著中英邦交新頁的展開。兩國外交史上的污點，都可以洗刷得一乾二凈了。</p>
<p>香港之歸英國統治，以及九龍之租與英國，都是英國往日侵略中國的結果。而今英國既以中國為盟邦，且在大戰期間，駢肩作戰，共同反對侵略主義，雙方的友誼，經血的洗煉，而益形鞏固；故在此際，不僅為中國，而尤其為英國計，從速消除過去英帝國主義的遺跡。彌補中英兩國人民間的裂痕，實在是最適時沒有了。</p>
<p>英國自工當秉政以來，不論其對內對外，無不採取開明政策。艾德禮首相一方面允許印度獨立，同時又宣佈英軍退出埃及。曾獲得全世界的好評。最近美國商務部長華萊士演說，調查英國在近東採取帝國主義政策，英人聞言，深為憤慨，於此可見今日的英國不復承認尚保有帝國主義的作風。準此而論，英國在遠東表示循其過去帝國上義道路走，更有將香港及九龍量還中國的必要。</p>
<p>惟香港九龍歸英國轄治，已有百年歷史，與我國進行談判歸還問題，在技術上因須若干時日，但我們決不能聽外交部老是擱置不談。英國或尚有一部份人希望拖延，但我們人民有督促政府從速開始交涉收回的權利。香港在遠東貿易，確實佔著極重要的地位。我們要求收回香港九龍，爲的是維持我國領土主權的完整，並沒有其他作用；而且我們還可以主張，把香港收回之後，仍作為國際贸易的自由港口，使其成為遠東南洋方面的贸易中心。這對於中英雙方。對於全世界，均有禆益。上海市參議會這一決戰。我們表示擁護，而且要求政府重視這一個代表民意的決議。</p>
<h3 id="c39">美國現代思想的轉變 <a href="#c39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>裴斐教授日前在同濟大學演講談話，提出兩個重要問題：第一是世界和平，第二是教育改革。從裴斐教授的觀點，我們可以看出美國現代思想的轉變。因為裴斐教授自己承認，他所說的不僅是他一個人的意見，而是現代美國大多數人意見。</p>
<p>關於世界和平，裴斐教授認為要為要避免戰爭，必須要建設世界警察的制度。警察代表一種力量，法律後邊沒有力量是不能推行的。他承認個建設工作非常困難，但是不可避免。有人問他是不是相信「力的政治」，他說這要看怎樣解釋。即如上海市要維持治安，因此設立警察，然而警察並不能算力的政治。</p>
<p>最近我們讀到許多美國政治當局，學者和新聞記者的言論，再觀察美國許多軍事準備和示威的行為，我們感覺在些言論行為的後邊，的確潛伏著大多數美國人對於國際關係已經有了一種新的看法。很少人能夠說美國人在今天蓄意戰爭，不願和平，但是他們的思想和第一次世界大戰以後完全兩樣。上一次戰後，他們相信可以用和平手段來爭取和平，這一次戰後，他們雖然一方面仍然採取和平手段，一方面卻積極準備武力，他們很明顯的，是想用軍畫力量來強迫和平。這是一般美國人的思想上一個劇烈的改變。</p>
<p>假如世界強國能夠在這次戰後的，同心協力，推誠相與，建設世界警察制度，世界並不難立致和平。然而他們彼此之間，疑懼橫生，特別是美蘇關係，日益尖銳。美蘇既然不能合作，爲著要求世界和平，大家都相信世界警察力量又是必需，結果丙國都打算擴張自身的軍事力量，來獨力建設世界警察制度。就算他們最後目的是在和平，他們目前的行爲似乎反而染上了爭霸的色彩。色彩愈濃，疑懼愈深，合作也愈難。這就是現在國際局勢上一切困難的癥結！</p>
<p>關於敎育改革，裴斐敎授給我們一個驚人的消息。他說美國敎育家很多主張學自然科學和工程的學生，以後應當兼終社會科學·哲學·和文學的課程。他還指出幾個有名的學校已經延長學生修業的年限，以便完成這個敎育理想的工作，如像最有名的麻城工業專門學校，已經從四年改爲五年。</p>
<p>這個改革的運動，發源於一個新的思想。好些美國智識界的人士，特別參加研究原子彈成功的幾位專家，都認爲現在人類對於「物與物」間關係的研究，已經到了驚人的進步，而對於「人與人」間關係的研究，卻依然故我。但是除非後一種研究能夠趕上前一種研究，科學的進步可能使人類自身毀滅！他指出世界學術上有兩方面，一方面是孔子，一方面是愛因斯坦，孔子的學術是講「人與人」，愛因斯坦是講「物與物」，拿現在來說，孔子的哲學也許有許多地方不適合於現代，而他的基本精神卻是目前最迫切的需要。</p>
<p>站在中國人的立塲，我們覺得裴斐敎授和一般美國敎育家這個新的認識，對於美國敎育制度是一個空前的革新，而對於中國的敎育制度更供給我們一個高明的遠見。中國人的科學研究，在敎授們最低限度的生活都很難維持的時代，當然談不上進步，絕對不會有知道太多的危險。不過中國近十幾年來，政府當局已經養成了一種偏見，重視研究科學和工程的學生，輕視文哲和社會科學的學生，即如每次留學的考試，後者的名額不過一二人，十分之九都派遣前者。這種偏見和偏重的政策，在敎育原則上是不合理的。今後中國的敎育，因爲時代迫切的需要，決不能放棄科學的研究，甚至處於反動複古，然而平衡發展，不偏向，不歧視，對於培養青年，至少也是一個最健全的辦法。我們的政府當局成開計劃，怎樣造成大批的「技術人材」，很少計劃怎樣造成大批的眞正的完全的「人」！我們的敎育家也成天提倡「科學敎育，」少提倡能夠推動科學運用科學的「精神敎育」！裴斐敎授的言論，對於我們今後的敎育，也可以視爲他山之石。</p>
<p>世界和平和敎育改革這兩個問題，是互相關聯的。世界要得和平，必須要人類互相幫助；人類要互相幫助，必須要世界上大多數的人澈底明瞭人與人的關係，互相了解。我們希望美國在兩種思想　轉變的過程中，努力敎育的改革，免除侵略獨霸的起點書吧；而在蘇聯方面，我們尤其希望也會發生同樣敎育思想的轉變。</p>

<p>〔法國新聞社伊斯丹埠十五日電〕官方頃宣佈，土耳其艦隊定于明日自斯米那瀝駛往愛琴海，舉行海軍大演習，惟英美兩國艦隊亦衕時在愛琴海舉行演習，三國海軍是否相值尚不可知。据土國負責噹局談稱，三國艦隊未必將魚貫駛入韃賴尼爾海峽，足以此舉為對付蘇聯之政治行動未免太露骨故也。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社開羅十五日電〕埃及政府方面人士頃談稱，自埃及國王法魯克最近訪問土耳其之后，預料埃及兩國關係在最短期內將有新發展。埃王訪土雖屬非正式性質，惟埃總理薛特基向報界發表公報，力言埃王訪問土國，對于兩國關係將發生令滿意之影響。又埃王此次在紅海一帶出巡，曾訪問煙波，足使埃及與沙地阿拉伯間之關係亦能改善。此外英國鑒於埃土關係有改善之可能，亦甚感興趣。又關于土耳其與敘利亞對於亞力山大地方問題所發生之爭議，亦可能由埃及出而調處而獲得解決。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社開羅十六日電〕埃及「米斯里」日報倫敦訪員電稱，蘇聯與土耳其關於修正土國韃靼海峽地位之談判倘若失敗，英國或將提議由英、美、希臘及土耳其締結軍事同盟，亦未可必。至以埃及而論，無需乎公開參加此種同盟，因依照英埃條約，埃及唯英国马首是瞻。按之四國同盟計劃，陸空兩軍歸美國指揮，海軍歸英國指揮，總司令部將設安加拉，供給站設貝魯特云。土項計劃尚無法證實。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦十六日廣播：對義政治及領土委會今日在巴黎召開會議，討論特港問題，英美代表重申其決心，謂特港應脫離義大利與南斯拉夫，同時亦應脫離任何國家之政治陰謀。</p>
<p>〔聯合社巴黎十六日電〕美國民主黨參議員康納萊今日要求和會設立特里埃斯特真正自由邦，不依附於南斯拉夫及義大利。康氏復引述外長會議對於特港商妥之原則稱，為和平計，此等協議應予遵重。「吾人須使特港成為世界和平安全之象征」。先是，南斯拉夫副總理卡臺里在義政治委會中發表演說歷一小時稱，西方強國企圖「在地中海區週　張下大鐵幕」，斯拉夫集團發動運動，欲使南斯拉夫在特里埃斯特自由區佔有控制的地位，英美方面反對斯拉夫之要求，僅為保護其在地中海之權利而已，其動機既非關心於特里埃斯特之人民，亦非關懷義大利人民云。按卡臺里之言，係擁護南斯拉夫建議，擬將特里埃斯特之海關貨　與外交，依附於南斯拉夫，特里埃斯特政府則由四強委員會共同成立</p>
<p>〔合眾社巴黎十五日電〕巴黎和會現已進入第八星期，然完成之事務，尚不及三分之一，當前最大之爭執，厥為兩點：一為義大利問題，另一為保希邊境爭執問題，形勢緊張，已臨擬牌之時，故欲在十月廿三日聯合國大會開會前結束巴黎和會之工作，顯已極少可能。此兩問題，不但對於和會本身實為難關，且於蘇聯及西方各國之關係亦伏危機。按特港自由港之命運，尤為和會最大之障礙，在今春四強外長會議中，亦以此項問題波折迭起。自經四強最后協議以該港為一自由港后，即曾成立一小組委會，以策劃特港將來設立政府之詳細計劃。然此一小組會一經開會，即因蘇聯與英美法之意見齟齬，辦事棘手，今在巴黎和會中亦發生同樣情形。簡言之，美英法及其與國均贊成特港應具國際性質，其行政長官，由聯合國種種指派，又特港與義南兩國，應同等脫離直接關係。行政長官在該港自由區內，具有廣大權力。然莫洛托夫所提出之蘇聯計劃，欲由該港全體人民投票選出一人大會，該港行政權力大部份即授予此一大會。至于行政長官之權力，當予以嚴格限制，且不對安理會負責，而對四強負責。至於保希邊界問題，東西兩集團亦意見分歧。前四強外長會議，曾決定於和會中，由保希兩國代表陳述意見，目下此一爭執正由和會之保加利亞領土委會處理。保國雖前為一敵國，而竟要求將西色，雷斯全部劃歸保國，俾在愛琴海獲得一出口，現已正式提出修正彊界案，然希臘僅要求沿現在之界線稍予修改，該國直至上星期五始正式提出彊界修正案。</p>

<p>〔路透社布達佩斯十五日電〕匈牙利新成立之反對黨自由黨領袖蘇爾育克，主張由歐洲較小國家，與法國結成同盟，以組成「第四強國」。蘇氏在議會中聲稱，目前世界大事，悉由三強指揮，英國距大陸太遠或太近，美國則在美洲，而蘇聯本身即等於一個大陸。匈牙利不應成為前述三強任何一強之附廣國，法國乃歐洲大陸上文化水準最高之強國，今法國雖尚忙於處理內政，但吾相信法國不久即可恢復其在重大政治事件中之地位。歐洲較小國家必須圍繞法國，組織第四強，參加聯合國機構之工作。蘇爾育克所發表之各次演說，顯示渠之自由黨乃一左翼民主及天主教派之政黨。</p>

<p>自由進步兩黨將合餅</p>
<p>〔本報東京特派員十六日電〕在吉田內閣成立時，人民成認吉田內閣為憲法內閣，即吉田內閣成立的目的，在修改憲法，提出本屆臨時談會通過而已，於護會才幕后，即將倒臺。惟本屆議會會期特別延長，且再有延長之說，而吉田本身似亦有自信可令其內閣維持至對日和會時為止。就一般政治情勢而論，吉田此種自信不無實現可能。因國外貿易即將開放，糧荒情形已漸和緩，社會黨對政府的攻勢力已不如想像中之猛烈。此次國鐵工潮談判中，社會黨態度頗為溫和，並未與共產黨取一致行動，在聲明書中，僅希望圓滿解決，甚恐這次罷工發展為一般政治性的罷工。共產黨本想將此次國鐵工潮轉換為全國政治性的罷工，再進而打倒吉田內閣，但此計劃終告失敗。於一日夜間國鐵工潮突告妥協，取消罷工之決議，其中當然不能不歸功於外援勢力的支持。國鐵工潮的解決，可說是吉田內閣的強心劑，自由黨所以推戴吉田為總裁的原因，也就由此情勢所造成。自由進步兩黨成認對日和會舉行時吉田將仍任首相，進步黨總裁幣原則將出任和會全權代表。因之可造成自由進步兩黨之合併。最近自由進步兩黨合併的傳說，塵黨日上，成認在明春有實現可能。現自由進步兩黨在議會中計二百五十席，恰過半數，但是吉田仍恐勢力單薄，極力拉攏少數黨派。吉田最近招待新政會之舉，亦可窺見吉田拉攏各黨之一斑。</p>

<p>我們認為當前建國最大的障礙，是一般國民戰后茍安因循的惰性心理，同時也由於共產黨的破壞和阻撓，我們要復興經濟，建設社會，而共產黨則破壞交通，潰決堤岸。我們要繁榮農村，恢復工業；而共產黨則要毀滅農村，摧殘工業。我們要使農工生產相互配合，提高人民生活；而共產黨乃是使農業與工業分離，使城市與鄉村隔斷。至於就整個建設來講：如果交通不能恢復，物資不能流通，經濟遭受割裂，社會遭受禍亂，當然要加增無窮的困難；但是我們民生的痛苦，非加緊建國不能解除，國家的生存和發展，非加緊建國不能保障。所以我們全國青年，必須認清目標，負起責任，克苦耐勞，掃除茍安畏難的惰性，羣策勞力，突破任何的阻力和困難，加緊我們建設國家的工作，以安慰抗戰先烈的英靈。關於實行三民主義，更是政府無可旁貸的責任，我們認為民族主義的實行，已經有了相當的成就，現在所亟待努力的是民權主義和民生主義的澈底實行。關於民權主義，我們認為要建立法治，保障自由，整飭政風，肅清寅汚，提高行政效率，切實施行地方自治，建立各級民意機關，健全基層政治組織，扶植真正人民力量，使民主憲政有確實的基礎。關於民生主義，我們認為政府應該立定決心，認真執行平均地權節制資本的政策。關於前者，要切實執行二五減租，實行土地法規，平均土地分配，務使耕者有其田，並倡辦合作農場與集體農場，以增進農業生產，提高農民生活。關於後者，要加強金融管理，仰制高利盤剝，誘導商業資本趨向工業生產，促進勞資協調，保護勞工利益，扶植農工組織，建立社會保險制度，切實推行生產運輸消費等合作事業。必如此，而後我們革命建國的工作才不致徒託空言，纔可以取得全國同胞的信任。（我們自信是熱誠的，勇敢的，純潔的中國革命青年。）我們具有革命的信念，對於中國和世界的前途，絕不悲觀，我們信仰三民主義是順乎天理，應乎人情，適乎世界潮流，合乎人羣需要的主義。只要我們努力實行，絕沒有不成功的道理，我們都抱定了服務的，創造的，正確而崇高的人生觀，我們關心中國政治和國家民族的前途，願為完成革命建國的偉業而犧牲奮鬥，而貢獻一切，我們願久恒的保持青年的忠誠，純潔的身份，排除世俗的升官發財的觀念。我們青年團員，誓必遵守團章，為人民服務，為革命犧牲，我們願做一個革命建國的無名英雄，我們絕對奉行國家法令，嚴守本國紀律，我們誓為三民主義的信徒，在我們團長領導之下，竭盡建國任務，自勉為國民革命的鬥士。我們對於政府今日所迫切要求的，就是為我全國男女青年，給予升學就業的充分機會，給予參加建國基層工作的充分機會，培養男女青年獨立創造的精神，加強全國學校各種科學與有關建國需要的教育，對於邊疆及海外青年同胞，尤須克盡教育扶植之責，務使全國青年都學習現代的知識與技能，集中於三民主義旗幟之下創造一個民有民治民享的新中國。</p>
<p>（四）本團已經成立了八年，我們的團民，無時不諄諄告誡，殷殷期望，要我們作為革命的幹部，使我們成為建國的動力，但是檢討過去，組織不夠嚴密，工作不夠實在，對團的任何方面說，都待我們作更進一步的努力，我們深切迫念在抗戰中與敵偽奮鬥而犧牲了生命的每一個同志，為了發揚他們光榮的史績，我們更應該發為奮雄、自強不息，以健全我們的青年團。</p>
<p>我們覺得為適應時代需要，加強革命力量，以掃除革命建國的障礙，以達成革命建國的任務，本團必須充實內部，強化組織，例如民主集權制之確立，基層組織幹部，政策之執行，優秀人才之徵求等等，無一不與團的前途成敗有關，茲已詳定辦法，必期嚴格推行。我們這一次大會，更有全黨重要的決定：（一）明確規定團在今後工作的方針，使我們團員今後的努力，更能切實而進步；（二）黨與團在同一主義，同一領袖之下，擔負國民革命的共同任務，但黨與團的幹部，則明確劃分，俾各專其職，各盡其能，使幹部有專一的責任，工作有專精的貢獻，期使我們的團成為健全而強固的三民主義青年的革命集團，克盡其對時代所負的重任。</p>
<p>最後我們特別提出幾點：（一）今後團員努力的方向，是要趨向於積極的建設，要從空洞的政治活動，轉向社會基層服務的工作，我們要認清我們文化經濟落後的根本原因，乃是中了幾千年士大夫不勞而得的錯誤觀念的遺毒，以致知識與生產分離，知識與職業分離，今後我們必須立定決心，確定職業崗位，走入農場，工廠、鑛山，進入邊疆，參加實際的生產工作，以糾正一般遊惰的風氣，以奠定國家建設的風氣，以奠立國家建設的基礎。（二）我們都是中國的青年，在精神上必須獨立自強絕不可喪失自信，不知不覺的作了人家的奴隸，固然我們在科學與工藝方面，要盡量的向人家學習；但須特別記著，我們學人家是充實自己，不是丟掉自己。（三）我們尊重學術自由，思想自由，對於研究共產主義、信仰共產主義，我們站在學術思想自由的立場，並不反對，但是共產黨破壞國家統一，破壞社會秩序，破壞民族德性之行為，不僅毀滅我們國家的前途，而且陷害我們青年為奴隸，我們真正愛國的青年，絕不能容忍。（四）我們深信有所不為，而后可以有為，我們不做官吏，我們鄙棄政客，我們必須努力於各種建設工作，願把我們的心力，貢獻到社會服務，貢獻到生產事業，我們認為改造社會為改造政治，仍可從建設社會為建設國家的根本，國家如果放棄社會上各種事業不和，那末澄清政治，建設國家，也就永遠沒有希望了。（五）我們要養成正確判斷能力，明是非，辨順逆，對於利用我們青年，欺騙我們青年，誘惑我們青年，使我們青年走上害國家，害民族，破壞社會風紀的任何黑暗勢力，我們不懂予以反對，而且要澈底的予以剷除。我們每一個青年，都有獨立自主的人格，都有對於國家民族的神圣義務，絕對不能供他人的利用，來危害我國家，危害我民族，破壞我們統一，破壞我們革命，以致斷送我們青年前途，我要喚醒全國青年，提高警覺，嚴防有人來利用我們青年，陷害我們青年。（六）我們要遵照團長「中國之命運」訓示，與第一次代表大會之決定，切實號召全國青年參加五大建設，並由團員率先倡導，以為示范，我們更要注重科學研究，必要實行社會服務，從實際工作中，年培養我們青年，訓練我們青來，否則就不是三民主義的青年，我們青年團決不能容納這種落伍的青年，以認其為團員同志。</p>
<p>以上所言，我們大家的認識，是我們代表全國青年所發出的呼聲。非常的時代，需要非常的事業，需要非常的努力，我們這一代絕不能放松我們對時代應負的使命。一切可以讓人，只有對國家對民族的義務和責任，不能讓人。一切可以妥協，只有對危害國家民族利益罪惡份子，不能妥協。同志們！同胞們！風雨如晦，雞鳴不已，我們務必團結一致，衝破艱難，以摧毀革命的障礙，拯救我們的國家。我們要負起責任，而對現實高峯三民主義的火炬，向前奮鬥，使三民主義的新中國，使博愛大同的新世界，早日是現於吾人之前。（完）</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕潘議長在紀念週中致詞稱：「參議會開始到現在，好比行路已走了一半，過去一星期的議程都是報吿和詢問，此外舉行了兩次小組審査會和一次全體審査會還沒有進行到討論和決議的階段任務的能吾完成尙待本星期內的努力。現在外界對於本會都很關切，因爲本會的任務非常重大，民主政治在上海也即是在中國表現出怎麽樣的精神來，完全要看這一次的參議會。大美晚報就有批評說：如果要知道國民黨政府下民意機關的精神如何，祇要看本屆的上海市參議會就够了。所以我今天十二萬分誠懇的希望大家要有實行民主政治制度的最好的表現和成績，要用求眞理的態度辨別是非，使人家明白我們確是眞心誠意的民意機構。其次，一般人往往以爲議會與政府站在敵對的地位，這種看法不是眞正民主的看法。舉例來說：英國政府本身就是由議會產生，當然沒有相互敵對的情形？中國現在雖然還在過渡時代，市政府尙未達到民選的階段，但是如果把整個上海市譬如一家大公司，市民是股東，市政府是經理部，參議會就好比董事會，也決不是相互敵對的。大美晚報又說：今後上海還是繼續發展成爲世界有名的大都市還是退爲第二流的不重要的都市，其責任全在這决參議會身上。所以我們特別要重視我們是指示方針和決定政策的機構，希望與大家共同勉勵來完成這重大的任務。這一次預算的審核希望至遲在第四次小組會議後能得出結果來。關於市政府的工作計劃，我個人的想法工作計劃其實就是預算的說明，現在大家把它分開來實在是很滑稽的事。好在下半牟度已經渦了將近三月，這一次審核如不能達到理想，下一年度一定要愼重從事。我們要市政府做事，就不能不給它錢，沒有錢那裏做得出事來，雖然能節省的當然還要節省。審査預算決算實在是這次參議會任務的重心，如果在這一點上能有良好的表現，也就是奠定了民主政治的基石，所以對於這次預算我們應予以合理的審查，祗要市府眞正做事，我們應該給他錢，不是增稅就發公債，這是我個人的一點意見。」</p>

<p>紀念週後休息十分鐘，由房屋分配委員會秘書長戴濟民報吿該會工作情形如下：</p>
<p>房屋分配委員會是在本年四月二十日才成立，以前虹口區日僑房屋共約八千餘幢，二三月間日僑陸續遣回後，遺下房屋被有力者紛紛佔據。日僑管理處曾會同市府及有關機關組織淸査隊淸查結果覺得情形甚壞，行政院認爲有成立專門機關處理之必要，遂於四月十八日開始籌備，二十日即成立房屋分配委員會，由市長兼任主委，分設總務調査執行分配四組，調用有關機關原有人員担任工作。</p>
<p>成立以後，最初計劃想先將可供分配之房屋數量及各機關需要數量等供求情形調査淸楚後再予以公平之分配，但事實上調査工作頗費時日，至七月底尙未能完成，乃改變辦法：一面調査，一面分配。</p>
<p>分配的標準係根據申請的先後次序提交大會審查後通過。事實上眞正的空屋不到二百幢，其餘都已早經佔用。對於那些已經擅行遷入的機關或私人，分配委員會准許他們塡具報吿加以審核，合乎規定的發給許可證，不合規定的設法加以驅逐，但是說到驅逐非常困難，有些武力機關根本趕不掉，甚至架起機關槍來抗拒。後來祗好向它們主管機關交涉，此外凡原來有業主的房屋則由中信局統一租賃，使業主得到相當的租金。</p>
<p>八千多幢房屋中，一部份是市房不在分配之列，可分配的祗五千餘幢，而各方面申請的數量需要一萬多幢。現在已經發給許可證的有二千四百三十九幢，分配予陸軍九百八十七幢，空軍一百三十六幢，海軍七十九幢，其他一千二百三十七幢。其中先佔住以後再發許可證的計一千五百二十四幢。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕市政府三十五年下半年度預算支出，行政部份，占全部預算支出百分之十四·四，總計爲一百三十二億。事業部份　占全部預算百分之八十五·六，總計七百十億。</p>
<p>行政部份經常費，包括市府及各局員工薪餉辦公費共十二億，連生活補助費，共爲九十五億。至於事業部份經常費，爲辦理各項業務之人員薪餉，如各校敎職員，各區工務處工塲，各衛生所，各救濟院，各警察分局等，共四十七億，加生活補助費三百六十三億，共四百十億。</p>
<p>行政部份臨時費，係市府及各局購置修繕費用，如印刷，傢具，汽油消耗，房屋車輛修理，廣吿，訓練等費，共三十七億。事業部份臨時費，係舉辦各項業務所需之材料工具，如市立學校增添學級設備，及補助私立學校，養護道路，新建道路，添裝路燈，開辦平民醫院，辦理淸潔所，補助市立醫院免費病床，警察冬服，印刷費等，共爲三百億。</p>

<p>參議員對於房屋分配委員會的質詢甚爲熱一烈，發言者有陸惠民瞿鉞陸蔭初等十一人，質詢的內容歸納起來有幾點：</p>
<p>（一）報吿內容過於空泛，數字不够詳確，究竟房屋分配委員會收到敵人佔據的房屋總數多少，地點何在，要求詳細披露。</p>
<p>（二）已分配房屋極多不公平的情形，有的一人分配到兩三幢而以金條出頂，不少公敎機關則根本分配不到。分配委員會究竟根據什麼標準，已分配到房屋的機關和人名要求公佈。</p>
<p>（三）非法强佔的情形非但目無法紀，而且是國民的恥辱，這種現象必須糾正。分配委員會應該將那些强佔機關的名稱在報上詳細公佈，用輿論的力量來制裁。</p>
<p>（四）政府定出一種法律，必須令出必行。房屋分配辦法是行政院規定的。行政院是最高執行機關，它定的法令如果不能執行，誰還能執行？事實上原定的辦法確有不妥之處，應該加以修正或另訂新辦法。</p>
<p>陳培德特別提出謝晉元夫人的居住問題，他說政府早有明令烈士還族應該有房子住，爲什麽到現在還不分配給她？</p>
<p>張志韓認爲制止强佔之風單靠輿論力量還不够，他主張參議會組織一個機構，以全體市民作後盾，加强房屋分配的工作。</p>
<p>王劍鍔則提出具體的事實，他說區公所要辦公地方，區裏面有三所房子，一所查良鑑住了，一所警備部偵緝隊用了，一所憲兵隊用了。聞分配委員會，答覆是已經有人住的，不要再轉念頭。他要問：所謂「分配」，倒底作何解釋？</p>

<p>首由公用局長趙會珏報告該局下半年度總預算，共計四十三億元其中經常行政管理費佔總預算百分之十六，事業費佔百分之六十二，補助營業費佔百分之十一。又由各附屬機關報吿公共汽車籌備處下半年度營業收支預算收入卅六億元，支出相等，擴充費支出二十二億元，其中一部份係借款，一部份由市府貼補。浦東自來水公司營業收人分表計收入五百八十五萬元，給水站三百九十三萬元·船舶給水三百二十八萬。支出方面：人車費約八百萬，開辦費二百萬，化騐費二百萬，雜費二百萬。市輪渡管理處營業收入十億元，支出相抵，增加建設後改良資產支出三億元。吳淞煤氣廠營業收人七億四千萬元，支出相抵擴充費十三億元，預計在一年內完成。</p>
<p>警察</p>
<p>次由警察局副局長俞叔平報告，俞氏首謂警局預算之編制，爲該局之經常業務項下計算之，蓋該局之工作當爲鞏固治安，禁絕烟毒，管理交通，正飭風俗，整理市容及加强消防等項，並依據各種工作之重要性，確定其編制，按照編制，總共人數爲二萬人，現有人數爲一萬三千人，與市民爲一與三百之比，俞氏繼則分析新預算之各種費別與需要，並舉例與前租界之警務經費稱。「以往租界警務經費，佔歲出百分之五十，消防費尙在外，爲百分之四，而照現在新預算，僅佔歲出百分之二十二云云」。</p>
<p>社會</p>
<p>社會局由李副長劍華報吿該局下半年預算當爲其最低限度，如冬賑費僅爲三千五百萬元，三個公典僅三百萬元。他如購買修繕印刷費三千萬元，事業及指導營業費一千四百萬元，農林擴充指導費九十萬元，公司工廠調査指導費一百萬元，其他調査指導費一百萬元，小本貸款損失費五百萬元，救濟事業補助費一千五百萬元。</p>

<h3 id="c67">關於公用工務 <a href="#c67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>第五審査委員會因有關公用工務提案約達八十件之多，故於昨日第三次審査會時，通過將全部提案歸併成二十大案。昨日討論者有二案：</p>
<p>統一車路·改善交通</p>

<p>淞滬警備司令部昨晨舉行絕食週時，宣司令就軍人强佔房屋事，有重要報吿，略謂頃奉蔣主席電令，對軍人非法强佔房屋者，均須速即自動遷出，吾則一經査明屬實，即將依軍法重辦。宣氏並表示限令强佔房屋者，均須於月底前遷出，逾期即以軍法處理。宣氏並將於日內召集陸海空軍將領談話。</p>
<h3 id="c69">組織考察團　考察國外教育　教育局所定私校補助費　李熙謀提交議充添免費額 <a href="#c69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>第六審査委員會審査關於敎育文化之提案，由周斐成主席。首將相似之提案歸併，分爲增設市立小學，補助私立中小學，增設民衆學校，職業學校，師範學校，提高敎員待遇等二十餘類。</p>
<p>關於敎育預算，市府規定佔總預算之百分之一九·七，本組各委員皆認爲應予增加，吾則敎育建設工作，無從着手。以增至百分之三十最合理想，至少亦應佔百分之二十五。</p>
<p>有關增設市立小學提案，達十九件推派審查委員二人加以整理，因時間關係，未及審査。</p>
<p>昨日主要審査工作，係關於私校收費問題。日前各參議員對私校收費無限制，指責頗厲，故各委員審查本案時，殊爲愼重，最後通過之審査意見如下：「私立中小學收費，應請市政府根據當時物價情形，斟酌規定，並詳訂使用分配標準，嚴加監督，倘有故意違背者，即予懲戒」。</p>
<p>出席本組審査之參議員，有私校校長數人，對私校收費，有所申述。皆認爲欲加强師資　發展敎育，目前之學費，不能謂之過高。敎育局副局長李熙謀氏亦列席，提議除嚴格規定百分之二十免費額外，並以敎育局所定之私校補助金，充作增添免費學額之用。各委員並決定在大會中報吿私校收費情形，並詳述苦衷云。</p>
<p>至於尊師金，已決定提議，不論中小學，下學期起一律不得徵收。關於各校敎員工作滿十年，休息一年，薪津照支案，擬請市政府切實辦理。</p>
<p>敎育局交議案：派遣敎育考察團，赴國外考察敎育，俾作復興本市敎育之借鏡，審査結果，決定辦法如下：由敎育局聘請對本市敎育文化有貫獻者，及在本市敎育界服務滿十年以上成績卓著者，組織國外考察團。</p>
<p>最後決定，對敎育局工作報吿作一決議案，推黃式金·陳保泰·王立本負責起草。</p>
<h3 id="c70">審查財政地政　初步議決要案 <a href="#c70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>第三組審査財政地政提案，昨日舉行第三次會議，初步議決案件擇要摘錄如次：（一）房租不加價案送請市府酌辦。（二）取締二房東額外需索及陋習應請市府從嚴禁止，並請市府酌定辦法切實施行。（三）建築平民住所送請市府酌辦。（四）房屋租賃糾紛案將與第十組審査法規委員會聯合討論（五）査明市區內荒廢公產，以資利用案未通過應另擬具遺產辦法呈准施行。（六）房屋原承租人有優先承租權，但有違反規定辦法者出租人得拒絕續租（辦法由大會通過後公布）。（七）停止征收保衛團服裝費，及免徵書業營業稅，均送請市府轉財政局辦理。（八）發還敵僞圈佔民地應請市府迅速切實辦理。（九）劃分共有土地，以免糾紛請地政局辦理。</p>
<h3 id="c71">房屋租賃管委會　仲裁時流弊百出　第十組審查規章引起激烈辯論　決定原則三項仲裁採取合議制 <a href="#c71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>第十審査委會負責審査法規提案，昨日討論房屋租賃管理委員會規章，計到委員陶百川，馬君碩，陳存仁，姜屛藩，朱亞揆，嚴諤聲，朱扶九，吳正矱·李文杰，范才揆，兪傳鼎等。地政局長祝平，房屋租質管理委員會主任秘書吳遵義亦列席，備作隨時解釋，以供審査參考。吳正矱，朱亞揆，兪傳鼎二委員首先發言，指摘房屋租賃管理委員會內部太不健全，仲裁糾紛時流弊百出，且經該會調解後，糾紛非唯不能解決，反因而引起訴訟，而法院對此類民事訴訟案件，輒不重視，一拖就是半年一年。又房屋租賃管理委員會之裁斷無法執行，且往往被法院推翻，因此該委員會已毫無威信，形同虛設，糾紛當事人對該會裁斷之公允，已發生莫大懷疑，故該委員會亟應加强組織，使本身健全。馬君碩參議員繼稱：房屋租賃管理委員會之產生，係根據戰時租賃條例第二十三條，但該條例第二十四條載明，該條例於戰後六個月失效，該委員會已　　法律上之　　，故修正房屋租賃管理規則，與處理糾紛辦法時，應愼重討論，且該會對房屋糾紛之裁斷時與法院有衝突，若目前本市仍需要該機構之存在者，必需先在「法」的方面考慮，將來建議中央完成立法程序。馬參議員又稱：過去該會之調解過於草率，僅由科負或專員單獨行之，因此弊端叢生，倘今後仍需要裁斷，則必需採取合議制。嚴諤聲則提出該委員會目前是否需要繼續存在，因事屬行政機關問題，故由陶參議員百川走詢第三組，得悉第三組之審査意見爲房屋糾紛可先由區公所調解，若調解不成再由租賃管理委員會仲裁。嚴參議員認爲第三組旣已如此決定此案可暫保留，俟與第三小組聯合審査後再定。馬參議員則認爲此純屬法律根據問題，第十組不能放棄。朱參議員扶九稱：市參議會有創制權，如屬需要可創單行特別法，再經主席批准或經過立法程序，優先應用。故目前先決是否需要存在問題。馬參議員則謂市單行法規性質屬於命令，命令不得牴觸中央法規，故該委員會之繼續存在與否，必先視其有無法的根據及其章規內容與法律有否牴觸。馬朱兩議員引經據典，爭辯甚久。後祝平局長起立聲稱：本市房屋糾紛仍多，該委會事實上仍屬需要，如存廢無問題，法規可討論。因爲時已晚，先定原則三項，其他問題俟與第三小組聯合審査討論再行決定。其三原則爲（一）區公所之調解，可由糾紛當事人自行決定取捨。（二）仲裁採取五人合議制，市政府，法院，警局各一人，地方公正人士二人，地方公正人士山參議會提出相當數額，由主任委員臨時抽籤決定二人。（三）修正草案由房屋租賃管理委員會自行擬定。</p>
<h3 id="c72">關於警務保安 <a href="#c72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>第二審查委員會。昨日下午審査有關警務保安之提案，分爲四大類：一，義務警察。自衛隊，保衛團問題。二，消防工作問題，三，提高警政效率問題，四警局應興應舉事宜。審査各提案時，以姜懷素氏發表意見最多。</p>
<p>本市勝利之初，原有保衛團之組織，嗣因中央有明令廢止各地保衛團，故前已取消。各委員皆認爲實無再予恢復之必要。至於義務警察，係遵照中央法令，輔助警察之不足，確屬需要，且應加强。冬防期近，市郊治安區保衛工作，殊爲重要，爲補足警力之不足，應組自衛隊，此係民政工作之一大重心，且有法律根據。各委員審査結果，認爲保衛團無須恢復，義務警察應予保留，自衛隊另行組織。</p>
<p>消防工作，關係市民安全，應予嚴密檢査，火警服務人員之道德，更屬不可忽略。但本年度市政預算中，並無消防一項。各委員會同審査結果認爲應請市府規定消防預算，加强消防設備，提高消防人員工作效率。</p>
<p>關於提高警政效率案，各審査委員認爲，必須澈底掃除過去巡捕房之遺毒，樹立新　政模範。警察爲人民服務，對待老百姓應有禮貌。揭警察員素質，規定須初中畢業，增加警員待遇，以委任最低級支薪。</p>
<p>至於警局應興應革事宜，就最切要待行者，分爲三類：査禁私娼烟毒。加强交通管制，肅淸扒竊小偸。皆照原則通過，請市府分別辦理云。</p>

<p>第七審査委員會，昨審査關於社會救濟及勞工之提案，共到十一人，由唐世昌主席，決定審査方法，並將全部提案，歸納爲十四類，由召集人作成初步審査意見，提出下次審査會，再作最後決定。並審査通過籌備主席花甲榮慶案。因潘議長等三十九人，以主席自出師北伐以來，無時不在宵旰憂勤之中。今歲恭値主席六旬榮誕，特向市參議會提議，發動民衆團體，組織慶祝元首花甲榮慶籌備會，建立永久紀念，以示崇德報功。</p>
<p>茲將十四類提案，分列於下：一，抑平物價及配給問題（四件）。二，勞資問題（三件）。三，社會福利問題（一件）。四，救濟問題（七件）。五，勞動義務服務（一件）。六，勵行新生活運動（三件）。七，農民福利問題（二件）。八，合作事業（二件）。九，失業問題（三件）。十，婦孺救濟問題（四件及臨時動議一件）。十一，抗戰損失賠償及救濟問題（一件）。十二，勞工福利（九件）。十三，臨參會決議案執行問題（二件）。十四，旅館業勞工請願案（一件）。</p>

<p>大會最後一個節目是討論幾項臨時動議。</p>
<p>周斐成等二十餘人聯名提議請市府接洽租借哈同花園闢作公園以供市民遊憇。討論結果因爲聽說工務局已經接洽過這件事，業主方面也有應允的表示，決議交第五審査小組會討論。</p>
<p>市長交議延長夏令時間至十月底以節省電力，參議員羣起反對。理由是時令已近霜降，如果再延長夏令時間，電力不見得能節省，對於起居工作倒有許多不方便，馮有眞更特別提出夏令時間對於新聞界早晨出報時間的影響。最後決議本案不通過，至於如何節省電力交由第五小組審査。</p>
<p>市府施政報吿的審査，議決由各組召集人聯合負責。</p>
<p>壓軸戲往往最精采，王先靑以沉痛的語氣喊出了「收回香港」的呼聲。他說：「今天報上有一段消息說香港政府發言人不承認九龍城是中國的領土。從九龍想到香港，目前上海資金向香港逃避的現象甚爲嚴重，最近港幣上漲，就連帶刺激了上海市塲。而且香港又是外貨走私逃稅的根據地，是一個驚人的經濟漏巵，香港居民都是中國國民，我們應該呈請國府迅速交涉把香港收回來。」</p>
<p>參議員們對他的提議熱烈嚮應，並且更提到另一個「毒瘤」澳門以及其他如新疆蒙古西藏等被侵佔的地方一律都應該收回來。最後由議長歸納意見，決定呈請國府積極進行交涉收回香港九龍澳門及其他因不平等條約割讓與租借之土地，以利領土完整案。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕關於跑馬的議案，昨再度在第三組審査財政地政提案席上興起了一番熱烈討論。熟悉跑馬廳歷史的陳參議員存仁提出了三點意見：（一）跑馬在任何國際大都市都有，並不能算是一種賭博，但不能在最閙熱地段內跑，應在郊區舉行，（二）根據土地法征收或令其遷栘，經費浩大，但跑馬廳產權問題頗値得硏究，故希望能組織一問題硏究會，根據跑馬廰條款，詳細研討，然後再作決定。（三）再由「問題研究會」放照大上海募債硏究會之辦法作爲參考，另行提供收回辦法，交下屆窖査會討論。後來由王劍鍔提出一個根木問題，他說：布長交議上　說「賽馬，我們先要問是純粹賽馬，還是帶賣彩票？如果發售彩票，我們可以請市政府轉呈司法院請示根據刑法第二六六條是否屬賭博　，如與中央法令有抵觸此案根本就毋庸討籲，但最後各位議員意見還是三三兩兩，越討論越達　了，這　闡　實在太大，結果遺是議決在下次審査會再討論。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕杭垣自去年冬季起，迄於目前爲止，連續發生「夜竊」案件不下二十餘起，但偸兒對象，俱爲軍政界長官，及律師與銀行界商界聞人，例如第三戰區長官部副司令長官上官雲相，淞滬警備司令宣鐵吾杭州寓邸，及中國銀行行長金潤泉，第三戰區長官部參議陳焱如，浙江全省保安司令部調查室主任胡錫文，律師葉葦，趙建新，所失竊者均屬金銀·珠寳·珊瑚·瑪瑙·金表·鑽戒。其間上官雲相寓所竊者爲現鈔四百餘萬元，宣司令寓所竊者，係貂皮大氅，灰背大衣，狐皮大衣，及珊瑚佛手玉鐲等。此外商務印書館，舒蓮記扇莊，拔嘉皮鞋店，延齡印刷所，恒昇漆店，及潘國剛師長之姪潘文彬，工務局技正張虎臣，王肅端等，均爲被害人。後經杭州市警察局擒獲窩贓犯一名，抄出手飾等物，根據供詞，乃獲主犯方正園，即上海濟豐當店總經理，據方犯供稱，在上海復興中路三一四號家中，有一部份贓物，遂由杭垣警局飭探長葉建中，於昨晨備文押帶方犯來滬，會同泰山分局員警密往方犯寓所，將方妻邱氏（湖北人三十六歲），乃子國斌（十九歲）逮捕，抄出「銀包金」手飾等贓物一大皮箱，旋復得悉另有是案要犯匿跡黃陂路五十二號，遂又折往拘獲熊楚安。張醒悟（均湖北人）等，人贓寄押警局，聽候押回杭州，歸案訊核。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕昨日美軍事法庭審判德籍「愛哈德特工局」戰犯時，被吿律師楊凜知曾對堂上痛施抨擊，謂爲非法楊律師稱：在司法院未正式表示同意以前，美軍在華審判戰犯，兩國政府間縱有協議，亦不能發生效力。故艾軍對此二十三名德僑，實根本上無審訊之權。彼並聲稱，就彼所知，司法院對此實從未正式表示同意，楊氏並引證美故總統羅斯福之言云，審訊戰犯之原則，應爲戰犯應於其犯罪之地點，由該地自由之政府予以審訊。楊氏稱：德人於一九二四年，即已喪失領事裁判權，此後即受中國之法律節制．但對美軍審訊日太戰犯一事，楊氏表示並不反對。</p>
<p>爲被吿普加曼男爵辯護之江一平律師，亦加入楊律師之抗議。彼於逐條誦讀美軍審訊戰犯法規後稱，被吿並未犯有此項法規中之任何一項。</p>
<p>德日一體　不可分割</p>
<p>至此，軍事法庭首席檢察官奧康納少校即予駁斥，謂中國法律所保護之德僑，係指普通商民，而非來華作中國之敵人者。彼謂各被吿皆係在戰區內所逮捕之戰犯，與普通罪犯不同。奧氏並稱：美軍駐中國，旣盡相當義務，亦即應享若十特權。對楊律師所稱，美軍來華，純爲擊敗日軍一點，奧氏駁稱，德日本屬一體，不可分割爲二。此决審訊各被吿，原爲維持世界和平，亦即保證勿使再有第三次大戰之發生。、</p>
<p>對楊氏所謂此次審判戰犯，係侵犯中國主權，且已引起中國人士反感一層，奧氏駁稱，如中美二國易地以處，美國極願於美國境內由中國軍事法庭審判戰犯。此次美眾事法庭之設立，事前經中國政府之全部同意，審判日軍戰犯迄今，亦從未聞中國政府表示抗議。彼謂：若中國軍隊亦被美政府邀請赴美，如中國政府現對美軍之所爲者，中國駐美軍隊如欲審訊戰犯，不特不致引起美國民衆之反感，且必引起美國民衆之擁護。</p>
<p>四嫌疑犯　在平被捕</p>
<p>奧氏否認被吿辯護律師所稱美軍不滿中國軍事法庭之說，但謂彼本人曾聞中國軍事法庭人才頗感缺乏，並建議能言善辯之楊律師，正不妨在中國軍事法庭中一展宏才。</p>
<p>對楊氏所稱，被吿係留華僑民，應受中國法律之保障一層，奧氏駁稱，彼等皆係中美二國之敵人，殊非普通僑民所可比擬。且承認彼等爲正式僑民者，實係汪逆精衛主持下之偽政府已耳。</p>
<p>另一被吿辯護人主張將被吿等釋放，因彼等不屬於德軍總司令管轄，故不應受德軍投降書之限制，此點爭執頗烈，至退庭時尙未結束，定於星期二晨八時續審</p>
<p>昨日開庭時，奧康納氏宣佈本案又有四嫌疑犯在北平被捕，彼等現尙覊押中國軍事機關，不久當可移解歸案。</p>

<h3 id="c89">刀劈親夫分屍案重判　詹周氏仍處極刑　·被告唯一申辯理由為非預謀　高等法院昨午開審一庭終結· <a href="#c89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕敵偽時期轟動上海之醬園弄血案——詹周氏刀劈親夫案詹雲影，事後並分屍十六塊，裝入箱內，企圖滅跡，為二房東王爕陽發覺報警，犯婦詹周氏由當時偽法院判處聆判時之詹周氏（中國社攝）死刑。被告奉判不服，正向偽最高法院上訴期中，勝利來臨，該項判決宣告無效，乃由本市高檢處重行偵查起訴。昨日下午二時半，在北浙江路高院開審，一庭終結，即席宣判被告仍處死刑。</p>
<p>（事前）詹周氏曾具狀高院，請求撤銷偽第一審原判決，依照刑法第二七三條，二四九條，第五七條減輕處斷。該項上訴狀係由義務辯護律師陳霞·施拜休所代撰，分述上訴之要旨，事實及理由各點如下。</p>
<p>（要旨）：查本案之發生係激於義憤，實在昏憒中臨時動機，並未深思熟慮，毫無預謀之因果。原審誤認購買菜刀為預謀之確證，支解拆割，乃殘酷之行為，從重處斷，判決極刑，實難甘服。</p>
<p>（事實）：緣與夫詹雲影結婚後，雖性暴勃谿，尚可應忍。自上海淪陷後，即嗜賭如命，不務正業。並開設嚮導社，日夜與敵偽勾結，引誘良家男女，妨害風化。對於家中生活，拒絕不顧，每月或返家一二次，必在午夜以後（備有敵偽通行證）長去時席捲當質，稍加勸導，即被兇毆，於卅三年十月，自覺生亦無益，吞服來沙而自殺，以了殘生。不幸為同居之露台上女房客發覺，車送新閘路宏仁醫院急救得生。十日後出院，夫雖明知而不蒙鑒憐，遺棄如昔，致生活更難，邀請鄰居集會助資，沿街叫賣醬豬肉等，以資過渡。故購菜刀·切板·竹籃等物，正擬開始營業，被夫夜返查悉，竟將流動資金刦去，以致又成泡影，遂代人繡花縫衣糊口。卅四年三月廿日晨三時夫返，口角毆打約兩小時，倦極均寐，於天明後，惡夢驚醒，在昏睡朦朧之中小便後，見有菜刀在側，頓覺夫禍國害民，遂突然動機，將夫頭割下後，悉大禍臨頭，乃將屍體支解，裝入箱內，擬携出棄去，不知如何，竟呆坐於床上，二房東王爕陽在樓下見血水下流，發覺報警，此本案之事實也。</p>
<p>（理由）：查上訴人因夫開設嚮導社與敵偽聯絡，禍國害民，一時義憤，有不堪容忍之刺激，造成殺夫巨案，法雖無可恕，而情實有可憫者。竊按舊刑法二八四條一項一款之罪，須以殺人出於預謀，方能構成。故殺害行為必須基於深思熟慮之結果，在實施以前，即具有一定計劃時，始能成立。如果殺意決於臨時，縱今夙有仇隙，為其促成殺意之遠因，要非蓄意圖害者所可同論。即未便繩以謀殺罪刑（參照廿一年上字二〇九七號判例）。而本案確係臨時決意，而並無絲毫預謀之行為與事實。原判但憑相像之詞鑄成預謀鐵案，何行法理之平，抑且支解折割，係　毀屍滅跡，並非殺人剜心割腹等殘酷行為所可比，故但構成刑法第二四九條第一項及同法二七三條之罪，對於犯罪之動機目的旣為臨時決定，並無深思熟慮之預謀行為，而上訴人前後所受之刺激尤為弱女子不能忍受時所反激。更無其他之蓄意，且生活困難，智識淺薄，均適合刑法第五十七條減輕之規定。伏乞恩准，從輕處斷，實為德便云云。</p>
<p>（周氏）現押於提籃橋上海監獄女監。昨日開庭前，特起解至北浙江路高院，身衣藍布短衫褲囚服，胸前繡有白色〔二二六〕號碼，赤足穿灰布搭口鞋。原有之長髮已剪與耳齊·身材矮小，面容慘澹。是時法庭之旁聽者，人頭擁擠，多家庭婦女。二時半，章慶瀾庭長偕推事王可權朱承讚，檢察官江公亮及書記官等蒞庭升座，即命法警押上詹周氏。先詢年歲籍貫住址，答稱：卅一歲，丹陽人，住醬園弄新昌路四三二弄八十五號後樓。網出檢察官陳述起訴意旨後，即開始詢問。問：你殺你丈夫是在卅四年三月廿日夜里三時？答：是早上天亮之事，我突然驚醒，起來小便。見馬桶旁小櫥抽屜中有把刀，即拿刀殺他。問：這時你丈夫是睡熟還是醒着？答：醒着，問：是向裏睡向外睡，還是仰睡或俯睡？答：記不清楚。問：第一刀斬在那裏？答：不知道，這時我自己已昏了，一點都不知道。問：殺時你丈夫叫喊沒有？答：老爺，喊不喊我不知道，我昏了。問：為何要殺你丈夫？答：並不是有心預謀，是立時三刻之事。平常他是不好，火氣大。吃著嫖賭，嚮導社常包。向他拿生活費，就要打。夫妻九年，一無感情。</p>
<p>（庭上）問：那末你可以離婚？答：我法律不懂。我丈夫幫人講，不給我生活費用，讓我軋姘頭，離婚時就可不津貼我離婚費。問：為何要斬十六段？答：殺死後，耳朵邊好像有人對我說斬斷他，斬斷他。問：你念凌空書沒有？答：沒有。問：家裏還有什麽人？答：沒有。問：娘家沒有什麽人？答：娘家沒有什麽人，詹家亦無親人。庭上繼問：你與小寗波有關係？答：沒有，一點沒有。問：以前為什麽承認？答：在巡捕房屈打成招，沒有辦法，自己作不得主意。問：你以前供切菜刀是由小寗波給你錢買的？答：沒有。問：是小寗波叫你殺的？答：他沒有說過。問：你一個人怎麼可以殺詹雲影這樣一個高大的人？答：我自己靈魂不在身上，〔出佬〕上身，殺時不當他人看待，像殺別的東西一樣。問：殺時亮燈沒有？答：沒有。問：你與住在前樓的賀大麻子通奸？答：沒有通奸，偕錢是有的。庭上即問：你現在為什麽把從前的口供都翻過來了？答：我一直是這樣說的。問：殺時賀大麻子幫你忙沒有？答：沒有。問：那末為什麽事後他要逃走？答：鄉下有人叫他帶餅回去，他就回鄉下去。</p>
<p>（詢問）至此完畢，審判長問周氏答：求老爺，我不是有心，實在因為一時糊塗，〔出佬〕上身。請老爺下筆（筆下）超生。繼即開始辯論，先由檢察官論告後，辯護律師繼之答辯。（理由詳見上訴狀）審判長宣佈辯論終結，待退庭評議後，即席宣判。時為三時另五分。被告暫時押下。旁聽者遂議論紛紛，空氣甚為緊張。三時十二分，法官重行蒞庭提上被告，即由審判長起立宣讀判決主文：詹周氏，殺人處死刑，褫奪公權終身，菜刀一把沒收。被告聞判尚欲多辯，連稱〔不是有心，〕庭上揮手阻當，告以如不服判決，於接到判決書後十天內，還可向南京最高法院申請覆判。被告遂仍由法警帶下羈押。</p>
<p>按此次開審時，被告方面會延美籍律師寇培太日籍律師數人。</p>

<p>〔本報特寫〕昨天下午二時，記者隨着市工務局第二區工務管理處處長吳文華，專員錢維藩，工程師徐德先等，參觀第二區的工務設施。工務局為求分工合作，事半功倍起見，對工程設施共分六區，所謂第二區，包括舊法租界中正南路以東之大部，南市舊場城廂全部，沿徐家匯路直至曹河涇閔行等處，又兼管浦東全部。我們乘上工務局的大卡車，自八仙橋青年會出發，至龍華，再轉南市，遊邑廟後各返原途。</p>
<p>謹記路　最大貢獻</p>
<p>工務局第二區的特點，便是它擁有了兩個歷史上的名勝——龍華塔和城隍廟，這兩大名蹟，經過八年戰爭的期間，都已破碎不全，景象悽涼！這一年來，在市民和當局全作下，大部分都已經復原，廟中的泥菩薩漆得亮亮的，登上龍華塔，就可以瞭望飛機場中一隻隻鐵烏的起伏，這些都是當地主持者自動集款修築的，相信明春朝廟進香的善男信女，必然更多。工務局第二邑廟中之九曲橋老西門英士紀念塔區在這兒最大的貢獻，是把謹記路——這條市區至龍華的唯一大道，每邊加寬了一公尺，今後每逢香汛到來，這條路上熙熙攘攘的擁擠程度，必然可以大見改進。</p>
<p>荷花池　清除污泥</p>
<p>遊完龍華塔，我們再轉向邑廟，邑廟是整個的商場兼遊樂場，歷年來經常地吞吐着大量的遊客，而長期戰爭給予它的破壞更烈，許多建築物都坍了燒了。光復後重建邑廟工程是地方人士發起的，經過工務局的同意後，組織整理委員會，一切經費都由市民與官方合　，現在都告完工了。其中工程最大的是清除邑廟荷花池污泥，逛過城隍廟的人，都知道九曲橋下的荷花池，歷來是讓念佛老太太當作放生池用的，那兒原是一池死水，並且也不知道已經過了多少年加以遊客們陸續地儘將垃圾拋入河中，所以早已臭不可聞了</p>
<p>捉烏龜　公開秘密</p>
<p>工務局因為這池污水，不但有碍觀瞻，而且直接影響了由高俯視龍華寺全景龍華古塔無數人的健康，所以在今年五月裏，把這池中十歲萬加侖的污水來了一次澈底的更換！抽水的工程由當地救火會擔任，據說當水抽完後，留在污泥上的，除極少量的魚類外，多的是大大小小不計其數的烏龜。賣烏龜的人，就不免趁此大捉一番，因為事實上，捉烏龜的人也必定就是賣烏龜的人，對這種公開的秘密，不知道那些專以放生修行的人，作何感想？</p>
<p>小世界　金碧輝煌</p>
<p>此外，邑廟附近的小世界，戰爭的一把野火，頓時成了瓦礫場，現在經過黃金榮，宗才良等的主持　，新的小世界已筑成了，比舊的更高大更堅固，裏面包括電影院，咖啡館，露天舞廳，書場等遊藝場所。據宗先生談：現在空着的二層樓，已決定租給前朱葆三路一帶的攤販，總計可容納貨攤二百個單位，一律裝置玻璃　台，現在合同已經簽訂，經租人大同公司每月凈得三百萬元，由二百攤販平均分担，俟裝歸竣工，不日即可開始營業了。一旦攤販在那兒復活後，小世界即將成為南市商業和娛樂的中心，那是毫無疑議的。</p>
<p>經過這一次的參觀，記者深深的覺得，龍華寺和邑廟，這本市的二大名勝，的確都已經復原了，但是單靠這兩個地方的恢復是不夠的，而且，復興後的中國，所需要的不僅是止於復原，更是在於創造！</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕瀋陽前敵軍戰俘　中營醫官川島，因對被俘盟軍之種種暴行，罪狀確鑿，榮為本市美軍事法庭判處絞刑。該集中營主任松田，因毒打美軍戰俘，且在彼任內，有美籍戰俘三人，因圖脫逃未成，重被逮捕，終至判處死刑，松田亦未謀阻止，因此二罪，亦被判處勞役七年。巴丹島之役，盟軍勇士多人，因眾寡懸殊，不幸被俘，即被拘禁於此集中營內。檢察官福勒少校宣讀供詞時，曾述及巴丹島英雄溫銳德將軍之證詞，溫氏否認曾與松田有　札往來之傳說。另一證人為美籍軍醫漢柏斯德，彼謂根據松田之命令，凡肺炎極重之病俘，日軍每日僅予以硫胺劑粉三公分，而即此戔戔之數，於病俘溫度稍降時，亦即靳而不興。美軍考來軍曹被捕時，患有盲腸炎，而川島故意延不為其診治，俟其盲腸潰　時，始首家入醫院，施行手術。于一九四四年的，川島又不允患有耳腺炎之病人與其同伴隔離，結果遂致被傳染者達戰俘全數三分之一。考來軍曹之證詞尤極悽慘，彼書面證明云：患盲腸炎達三日之後，始行送院開刀，時適麻醉藥業已用罄，彼遂不得不于神經完全清醒之時受英刀圭，偶或呻吟呼痛，川島即毆　其頭，高呼〔不准吵〕　。而手術完畢後，川島乃又命其自行從手術　爬起，走至牀鋪。按川島在集中營有二綽號，一曰〔屠夫〕，一即〔不准吵〕也。</p>
<p>雷訥遜軍曹之證辭稱，一日戰俘于勞役畢歸營時，川島命患病者皆行出列。應命而走出者約八九人，彼等之病症多係凍傷，足趾有凍至紫黑者。川島乃命彼等脫去鞋襪，立于冰塊之上，而其時天氣，實已寒至零下二十一度。川島乃向彼等嚴厲訓斥，謂天下初無〔凍瘡〕一物，然後始准彼等離去。</p>
<p>另一美軍曹賴氏證詞稱，彼曾目覩松田之助手三木，曾用長三尺粗半寸之木棍，痛毆戰俘四人，彼謂三木痛　此四人頭部耳下之處，往往一　甫下，即被　　，彼等踣地後，又繼續痛毆，使彼等不能動彈始已，且謂此係　育美軍之一法，彼言美軍正如禽獸，理應受禽獸所得之待遇。三木自稱年三十歲，且係東京市國大學經濟系畢業生，自認曾　辱美軍十人至十五人左右，彼現已被判處苦役二十年在案。</p>
<p>三木述及處決此圖逃未成之三美俘時稱：該次行刑，係于一九四三年七月十三日執行，先將彼等　目　住，然後將彼等之手臂申　于木十字架上，命令坐下，腿部交叉。七八公尺以外，日本槍手以跪下姿勢，向彼等瞄準，一人射頭，一人射胸，一一開槍，以資取樂。</p>
<p>另一美軍少尉證明，曾目覩日本軍官將皮鞋跟於一美海軍之面上用力碾磨，另一美籍軍俘則曾被命連續立正十日，此十日內，只許睡眠十小時。</p>

<p>〔本報南京訊〕敎育部聘任督學郝更生，向敎部呈報視察東北敎育情形，已略誌昨日本報，其關於東北中正大學，長春大學，吉林大學等之視察報吿，亦已呈部，茲再探誌於下：</p>
<p>接收敵偽產售價五萬萬</p>
<p>（一要私立東北中正大學籌備處：該校將設文·法·理·工·農五學院。文法學院，利用前興亞會館，房屋寬敞。理工學院，利用鐵西前奉天工業大學舊址，（日人曾費一百五十萬日元，建築該校），房屋面積佔一萬三千餘平方公尺，其中主要設備，曾被人運去，尙有一部份殘餘設備，差堪應用。農學院，在四平街，原係日本之農塲，規模頗大。關於基金，曾以接·收·敵。僞·財產，售·價·達·五·萬·萬元流通券。該校請求備案手續，正在積極辦理中。已另有公文呈部。同時該校董事長杜聿明長官，已有專函致部長，說明一切。</p>
<p>建築宮殿式具暖氣設備</p>
<p>（二）即將成立之長春大學：該校擬設文·法·理·工·農五學院。農學院，原爲僞滿建國大學校址，建大直屬偽滿國務院，學生多公務員受訓性質，建·築·多爲宮·殿·式，禮堂至少可容三千人以上。地板損壞，坐椅已空，暖·氣·設·備·尙完整。距該校不遠，有建國忠靈廟一座，全部宮殿式，建築十分精美，房舍雖有一部份遺留彈痕，但建築本身大體無壞。此廟規模宏大，當可供長春大學應用，惟正在硏究中，尙未確定。文法學院，在原僞文敎部，設備殘缺，建築無大損壞，將門窗加以修理，差可應用。工學院，即利用新京工業大學，破壞不多，現尙有軍隊居駐。醫學院，原爲新京醫科大學，其中一切設備完好，學生護校精神極佳，過去敎授幾全爲日人，現有台灣人郭松根君，對於維護學校十分努力，已由臧特派員暫請其任代理院長，以維院務，一俟長春大學籌備人員到達後，再予調整。學生人數，現有一百八十六名。該院上課情形一甚好。爲防霍亂，學生曾至街頭講演，施行注射，服務精神甚佳。在長春擬入長春大學之學生，來自瀋陽者，有八九百人，來自哈爾濱各地者近千人。該校學生與校舍，似皆無問題，要在主持有人，從速籌備開學。更生在北平曾催促黃司長如今尅日前往，聞已於八月十日首途赴長春矣。</p>
<p>堅固之玻窗燒成波浪形</p>
<p>（三）大陸科學院：該院在僞滿時　爲日人開發東北之豐富資源，促進其產業擴大國防技術硏究之中心。科學研究機構，規模雖不甚大，包括部門甚多。八一五後，曾有一部份設備，被刦奪未遂，毀壞焚燒，圖書室雖有避火設備，無如汽油烈燄，書架上之書籍，悉爲灰燼，堅固之玻窗，被燒成波浪形，可見焚燒之慘烈。該院現由經濟部接收，按學術研究系統言，似應交中央硏究院繼續辦理。</p>
<p>吉大不恢復地方人失望</p>
<p>（四）吉林大學補習班，設在前吉林大學舊址。吉大係九一八之前落成者，其前身在民國廿五年爲高等師範。廿七年日人改爲師道高等，卅一年改爲師道大學。當時學生有一千七百餘人。在八一五後，曾經駐軍，學生及敎職員自動組織護校，故校產破壞有限，損失亦微，（開過去曾駐兵七次）。現有敎職員廿五人，（職員十四人），學生三百五十三人，內有女生五十九名。敎員住宅有廿五所，可容四十家居住。圖書有三萬餘册，化學儀器，被人損壞，幸全部損失不及百分之廿五。現開辦補習班‘經費係由該校師生向各方籌募。更生與臧特派員視察後，已由特派員辦公處，每月允撥補助費四十五萬元流通券。該校學生生活淸苦炊食無油，只煮鹽豆佐食。八一五以來，敎員未曾領薪，自動授課，近四個月，校舍作爲師範學院，差堪足用。吉林地方人士，對於恢復原有吉林大學，頗具熱忱。梁主席曾的集地方人士，向更生說明恢復吉林大學之理由如下：（一）省政府早注意此事，曾在省府委員會議席上，決議從速恢復吉林大學。（二）恢復吉大，是恢復舊校，而非新設。（三）長春大學地點偏西，不如永吉之適中。（四）永吉山明水秀，文化水準較高，故希望有一大學。（五）如限於政府學校名稱之規定，以地名而不以省名，則永吉爲吉林市所在地，仍可稱爲吉林大學。（六）張作相曾以一人之力，舉辦一大學，而今日中央之力，不予恢復，實使地方人士失望。在更生離瀋陽北平時，黑龍江省韓主席，與合江省吳主席，及兩省敎育財政廳長等，亦曾一再請求轉陳，及時恢復吉林大學。</p>
<p>古物三萬件　先後遭刧掠</p>
<p>（五）博物館：原爲湯玉麟住宅，九一八之後，由日人改爲博物館。現本部特派員辦公處亦設於此。但樓上大部份爲軍部特派員辦公處所住用，迄未讀出。內有古物保管庫五處，原有古物三萬七千八百另三件，先後均遭刦掠，如熱河行宮佛像，不能取去者，即損壞之，所留者。僅爲碑文刻石等。現正準備成立東北文物保管委員會，從事整理散佚古物，擬聘金毓戰先生任主任委員，負責進行。</p>
<p>舊穩定文溯閣多明朝檔案</p>
<p>（六）（十三）圖書館：館址在舊皇宮，舊稱文溯閣，貯有四庫全書，計子部九〇七一册，集部一二二六五册，史部九四〇八册，經部五五〇九册，殿本圖書集成五〇二〇册，此外復有殿本四庫總目一二七册，四庫全書考證七二册，除四庫全書共四萬一千二百七十三册外，其他書籍十五萬册。該館存有明朝檔案甚多，另有日人島葉一部極珍貴之書籍，亦藏此館。島業原想出售，我方願保留應用，此問題迄未解決。文溯閣藏書庫，建築堅固，且防火險，書架皆以鋼製，門窗悉包鐵葉，以期萬全。</p>
<p>馮庸大學校暫不擬恢復</p>
<p>（七）此外瀋陽私立馮庸大學，據馮校長本人云：本年內以學校產業，尙無法收回，經費來源斷絕，故暫不擬恢復。關於哈爾濱之專科以上學校，以事實上之困難，未能前往視察，但於楊市長所塡具呈哈爾濱維持敎育部直轄大學經過中，亦可知其梗概。所有東北區專科以上學校之調整，除未收復區之各校外，餘皆與本部所指示辦法，無大出入。</p>

<p>戶口複查塡表須知</p>
<p>上海市政府民政處第二科，頃編「設籍登記過錄前戶口複査塡表須知」如左：</p>
<p>過錄設籍登記前，辦理戶口複査，關係至爲重要。因初次辦理設籍登記，聲請義務人不再另塡設籍登記聲請書，聲請書即以戶口調査表代替。本市自二月間辦理戶口淸査以來，戶口調査表所載戶口情形與戶口事實，多有不符，自不能貿然以原塡戶口調查表作爲過錄之根據，而必須於過錄前辦理戶口複査一次。</p>
<p>其次，現有戶口調查表，因（一）初辦戶口淸査，辦理人員不諳塡表方法，（二）法令迭有更改，致塡寫人員無所適從，故錯誤甚多。若即據以過錄，將一錯再錯，而設籍登記後更正錯誤，手續繁重，故必須於過錄前。詳爲複査，以免登記錯誤。</p>
<p>今過錄工作即將開始，過錄前辦理戶口複査，吾人必須認淸：（一）設籍登記各欄、絕對不可有錯誤、故過錄前戶口複査，必須使戶口調査表記載正確。（二）設籍登記開始後，本市戶籍行政，將納入正軌，自不應再有戶籍不正確之情形。（三）戶籍登記，欲求正確，必須由戶口始，一戶一口記載正確，一甲一保甚至全市自均正確，故每一市民，曁每一複査人員，必須認淸此點，愛護本市戶政，對戶口複査，不馬虎，不草率。</p>
<p>茲爲求複査正確，特將戶口調査表各欄塡寫方法，詳細說明於後，以供本市市民，曁各級戶政人員參考，又此項說明，爲過去各次塡表方法之統一規定，今後塡寫各項聲請書及登記簿，均以本說明爲準。</p>
<p>一·稱謂　「稱謂」爲說明戶內各口之身分關係，共同生活戶戶內各口之身分關係，以戶長爲中心，故各口如何稱謂，均以戶長爲想對人。調査戶口時，如非戶長對答調査人員，每易錯誤。如戶長爲「父」，調査時由「次子」對答，「長媳」易誤答爲「嫂」。故市民答覆調査人員，或自塡聲請書，應以戶長口吻，各人稱謂始不致誤。調査人員調査時，更須注意此種易誤之處。　共同事業戶戶內各口之身分關係，則按各人在此事業組織內之地位塡稱即可，如商店內「司帳，」「掌櫃，」學校內「敎師，」「學生」等。</p>
<p>二·姓名　「姓名」爲一個人在社會之記號，一個人之權利義務，均以姓名爲依據，故姓名應塡在社會上通用之名字。別號·化名·或婦女慣用之某某氏，均不能塡用。三十年七月十七日國民政府公布的「姓名使用限制條例」，關於姓名有下列之規定，足見戶籍登記時，塡寫姓名，須愼重爲之。</p>
<p>（第一條）中華民國人民之本名，以一個爲限。登記於戶籍上之姓名，爲本名。使用姓字或別號者，應表明其本名。（第二條）財產權之取得，設定，移轉，或變更，應使用本名，或表明其本名。（第三條）共有財產使用堂名，或其他名義者，應表明共有人之本名。共有人總額數超過二十人者，得僅表明代表人之本名。（第六條）對於公務員合法之調査，應用本名報吿，其不使用本名者，處拘役或一百元以下之罰金。</p>
<p>三·性別　塡明男或女。（未完）</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕證券交易所於昨日上午十時，正式開拍各種上市股票。市塲自紅盤開出後，交易極稱平穩。空氣亦殊閒散，二小時交易結果，各股價格均趨下游。</p>
<p>九時五十分，該所理事長杜鏞，總經理王志莘，協理楊蔭薄，顧善昌，主任秘書華文煜，經理陳續弊，副理張積三等，魚貫入塲。十時正，杜氏特親按開市鈴，鈴聲起處，各交易櫃即逐一開做紅盤。五分鐘後，各股票紅盤開奔，鈴聲再起，正式交易開始，各經紀人買賣之叫囂聲，隨以俱起。</p>
<p>昨日塲內一般行市，尚稱穩定，紅盤因心理上影響，熱股二大三小以及冷門一二中型股均見高價，開盤價開齊後，多頭獲利了結，漸被賣戶壓迫，惟因金融幫不時略予維持，過程雖疲而多盤，全塲除冷門小股華豐搪瓷及麗安百貨兩者最爲特出，前者有散戶游資哄抬，後者本身於近午時落手拉提，竟站高價結束，惟該兩股成交尚未普遍，結果較前收計永紗美亞跌落少許，景福新光勤興各跌半成，冷門各股除華豐麗安最爲生色，前者略告微升，後者開出即跌起二成餘，而以頂價結束，結果較上週六猛漲四成外，餘者均稍低落，中型股有回小半成者。</p>
<p>昨日各股漲跌限度，均係按各股開出之紅盤價格，分別計算。今後各股之漲跌限度，則將照前一日之收盤價格分別計算。</p>
<p>昨日股票成交額總計四，三四七，四〇〇股，成交數量最多者爲永安紗廠，計達一百二十萬股，景福亦近五十萬股，新光勤興永安公司各股成交量，亦均在三十萬股以上，中紡中國絲業較少，均不到萬股。</p>
<p>下午五時，各經紀人齊集市塲，實行集體封帳。至六時卅九分均告軋平，證交當局認爲滿意，又證交於昨日在股票市塲張貼公告數項，茲擇其重要者分誌如後：</p>
<p>第十四號公告各經紀人交貨時每張股票應附下證件：一，股票正面應附證券收解憑單。二，股票背面應附：</p>
<p>（一）股票過戶申請書。（二）股票買賣記錄表。（三）股票賣契紅或藍均可。以上均須經紀人蓋正式圖章。</p>

<p>— 中央社九日朝陽訊</p>
<p>熱河自九一八翌年淪陷於敵寇，桎梏了十三年，民衆日夜在盼祖國來解放他毋，霹靂一聲，小鬼投降，男婦老幼驚喜欲狂，而去年中秋節開來了陌生的八路軍，他們以爲是國軍，而顯示出欣慰歡迎的情緒，經過了個把用，領受到這冒牌國軍的恩賜，只是鬥爭，橫征暴斂，他們才茫然了，但共軍就在此眞假莫辨的時間，侵佔了承德，赤峯，以及熱北各縣，收復塞北之國軍，也就被阻於平泉以東，及古山（赤峯南七十里）以南，五月間，復被迫自古山退至葉柏壽，從此熱河西北兩面，遂陷入水深火熱之中。</p>
<p>反擊開始進軍神速　此後赤峯承德各縣民衆，不堪共軍騷擾，不斷推出代表面見國軍指揮軍官石覺將軍，及省府劉多荃主席，並請從速進軍，解除倒懸，當局總礙於停戰協定，而不能前進，這不但大拂民衆之意，同時還引起了中下級軍官及士兵之誤會，尤以古山退卻之後，朝朝夕夕遭受共軍不法襲擊，十三軍的官兵，幾乎憤懣欲死，這次爲了打破共軍進擊國軍打通冀東的陰謀，十三軍下了迎擊的前進命令，士兵們摩拳擦掌，個個露出笑容，不再怨滿他們的長官了。</p>
<p>反擊是自八月二十七日開始的，十三軍擔任北路，由葉柏壽直搗赤峯，當時的計劃，以爲九月五日可復未範，但是八月二十九日竟已完成使命，一百公里的崎嶇山路，祗費了兩天半的時間，而北路於同日亦恢復了古北，次日即逾黑水，挺至乃林，到達了赤峯的界內，進軍之速，正足證明了國軍的實力，同時劉冬葵主席，躬　危險，率領民工，隨軍搶修公路，左近居民，頭頂槍林彈雨，擔著水送到前綫，全然出於自願，這更處處顯出軍政官民的合作精神，及對共軍的厭惡。</p>
<p>美麗輪廓完全變形</p>
<p>記者於六月中，曾爲「承德一週記」一文，介紹過承德的美麗輪廊，而今這美麗都市變形了，經過共軍退卻時，破壞搜刮，電燈失明，房屋破損，財貨一空，在全熱規模最小而唯一具歷青跑道之飛機塲，亦被破壞的不堪再用，處處暴露共軍的盜行痕跡，而問過被掃蕩然的商民，他們倒說「東西雖沒了，精神上若釋云了一種枷鎖」，是的，他們接待了祖國的軍隊，確是覺得輕鬆了。</p>
<p>市面上的買賣雖多已開張，但是因爲以下的原因，所以仍然蕭條，（一）舊日商店十九被鬥爭，給清算了一空，幾月來繁榮的南營子大街的買賣，又都爲共黨的機關合作社所壟斷，此次退卻前，官私貨物，掃敗刧掠西運，（二）共軍祭用法幫，濫發邊幣，退卻時又搜刮民存之法幣，滿載而逃，收復後邊幣已無人接受，而法幣及流通券，又難供籌碼之用，（三），平古錦古路未通，日用品短期內不易自北平或錦州運來，今年熱河可望豐收，糧食本不成問題，但現在承德則頗感缺乏，白米麵粉一點看不到，這總是一時現象，石軍沓就任承德警備司令後，一面安撫軍民，一面趕修被毀之建築物，市面的秩序，恢復極速。</p>
<p>日夜搶修努力輸血</p>
<p>平泉至承德的公路鐵路，破壞的眞夠澈底，路基都已看不出來，枕木一根不見，鋼軌倒間斷可以看到幾條，歪斜的躺在或遠或近的道坡上，鐵橋無一完好，而橋椿上除了誹謗元首之標語外，還有「建設民主國家」，「建設新熱河」的粉刷白字，這「建設」的白字，正刷在破壞的橋椿上，可謂一大滑稽。錦州鐵路局萬國賓局沓，東北保安司令沓官部工兵指揮官李賢少將，已隨軍西上，督飭員工日夜搶修，凌源至平泉段，日內可望完成，倘能修至承德，則錦承路運一通，則承德無疑的可立告繁榮。劉多荃主席，八月二十七日隨軍西進，承德克服後，一度返朝陽，一面諭省府各廳處，準備復員承德，坐不暇暖，復偕李守廉委員，率承德灤平等縣沓，匆匆西上，昨至平泉，今往承德，省府各廳亦抽調一部人員，馳赴承德接收該管業務，刻承德已成立省府辦事處，預料月內，可全部復員，據劉主席語記者，一切準備就緒，只待交通工具有著，即可全部復員，另據劉敎育廳長談稱，「承德學校復員後，師資最感困難，尤以中學爲然」，極據稱劉主席亦決盡力提高，記者於此寄語平津學者斟酌之。</p>

<p>本市又有平價糖發售，這眞是市民的福音，因爲以前幾次，雖然發售過，但秩序非常混亂，結果還不是那些年輕力強的壯士得利，而且當局雖規定每人限購三斤，實則南貨商藉口普通發售，每人限購一斤二斤不等，能依當局規定發售者，絕無僅有，此次規定：每人憑自份證限購二斤，並放長時間，上午亦有發售，故秩序漸見良好，惟憑身份證，仍未公允，因身份證，要十三歲以上的人才有，所以十三歲以下的兒童，就無福享受。依事實言，兒童較成人之需糖量，實有過之無不及，尤基是嬰孩，故希望下次發售時，能再加改善，每戶憑戶口證一次領完，那麽對於時間手續等諸方面，簡便不少，希有關當局注意。　（周麗）</p>

<p>— 六日南京訊　楊雁冰</p>
<p>在國防部陳總長招待記者席上，記者得到另一同業的報導，翌日傘兵總隊在京作首次盛大演習。這一個寶貴的綫索，給記者們太興奮了，靜靜地想著明天的精彩節日，同時更推測著會不會讓我們臨空迫鎭地看「天兵天將」呢？心凝神馳，整夜在動盪中渡過。</p>
<p>五日一大早，記者在機聲隆隆中驚醒，看手錶已經七點二十分，急了，急了，三分鐘內忙將整個梳洗和內務整理作完，坐了汽車，拚命地向新街口集合的塲地去，這時街上人還不多，報販沿街叫喊，車過中正路，祗見同業們的車一輛一輛向中華門進駛著，出中華門車駛得更快，記者以最近一輛車，首先到達傘兵總隊檢閱地點，不禁興奮極了！</p>
<p>這時候，遙視一列一列的傘兵，在大操塲上整齊地排列著，記者尋著指路碑向校閱塲內進發，招待員笑迎過來，並贈送今天的節目單。在簽名簿上發現國防部白部長健生將軍也來了，白部長戎馬倥傯，與記者久別，今天能得重瞻豐采，這是參加盛典中之又一收穫。</p>
<p>八時正，白部長率領馬崇六中將，徐庭瑤中將，以下校閱官及隨員三十餘人，向校閱塲中前進，這時傘兵總隊馬司令師恭由蘇州防地趕到，陪同校閱，白部長行至每一行列，頻頻點首，顯似很愉快的樣子。以後參觀內務，摺傘實習，多所垂詢，並予指示。參觀武器時，馬崇六將軍以美式最新步槍向白部長說明，白部長提起槍來，並作錨準動作，向記者笑謂：「我是二十歲從軍的，一向慣用步槍，今天拿起這美式步槍，與三十年前使用的步槍，完全兩樣，科學進步，眞不勝今昔之感。</p>
<h3 id="c147">幼苗成長　徵象國家新生 <a href="#c147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>旋即參觀基本跳傘。記者想著這國防幼苗的成長，正徵象中華民國的新生。乘興詢白部長對於今後傘兵的建設目標，他告訴記者：「中國傘兵，是在民國三十二年建立的，兩年來突擊衡陽，丹竹，桂林的戰功，實在太偉大了；現在這一批一批的幼苗，一定使他好好的長成，我們預備擴成許多師許多軍，以擔任今後國防任務。」……十時十五分，參觀戰塲心理測騐，熱烈精彩的一幕，在一個數百公尺的塲地上展開，幾十個士兵在地雷，砲彈，炸彈，交熾的火鋼中，演習越過電綱的戰鬥動作，這時火力密集，響聲連天，地雷炸彈同時爆發，紅綠燃燒彈的煙火，籠罩著陳地，隱隱約約中祗見士兵在塲地匍匐行進，如臨大敵，白部長幾度詢講記者們：「動作好不好」？言下似有無限愉快。旋即參觀。戰鬥演習，成績亦極可觀。白部長於進行中向記者：「今天有沒有新華日報記者？他們來看看我們倒很歡迎的。」引起記者們一陣微笑。</p>
<p>十一時半，參觀完畢，在招待室裏略進茶點，即乘車返城。</p>
<h3 id="c148">空軍跳傘　節目特殊精彩 <a href="#c148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>午後一時半，在明故宮機塲，參觀空軍跳傘，這是最精采，也是首都空前未有的一個節目。傘兵戰士們的情緒，比炙熱的秋陽更熱烈，他們將要以在廣東，羅定·西江·以及衡陽上空的戰鬥美姿，呈現給首都百萬市民和高級軍事長官們，這時空軍運輸站室內門外到處是人，空軍總司令周至柔中將到得最早，白部長帶了夫人和二位公子也來了，馬崇天中將，徐庭??中將，張鎭中將，警察廳韓文煥廳長，國防部專車裝載了十位官員前來，另外還有幾十位女眷，三架47式的大型機面對著校閱台，參加跳傘的三十六位戰士分配了三〇二號，二九七號，二九六號三架專機，每架十二人。他們在排除上機的時候，記者羣看準了機會，要求隨棧參觀，結果記者九人剛好分成三組，每機三人，我懷著欣喜好奇的心情走進了機門，不一會，馬達發出巨響，機身慢慢的上昇，先搞空一匝，指揮敎官陳鐘貴·黃凱·王克裘·楊德潤領導著唱「傘兵歌」。他們多半在廣東開平作戰過的，在烽火中拼過死命的人，今天是值得驕傲的，再從窗口向下望，田畝溪流，星羅棋佈，揚子江水如帶，清涼山，中山陵園，…漸漸掠過去了。</p>
<h3 id="c149">一朶百合半空隨風飄盪 <a href="#c149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>祗五分鐘左右，到了一千英尺上空，鈴鈴鈴機尾傳出了一陣急促的鈴響，表示這是跳傘開始的信號，接著一具測定風向的橡皮人被推下機門，試騐風向，艙們的人趕快看隆落的姿勢，記者所乘三〇二號機，第一名表演的是敎官鳥啓發上尉，他在機門前做出準跳的姿勢，旁邊兩位敎官，給他檢查一番，機身一個大迴旋，已經到了明故官上空，鳥上尉隨即躍下機門，兩位助手忙著收扣帶，大家擠到機門前去看，一朶美麗的百合花在半空中隨風飄盪，慢慢的下墜，在陽光裏更顯得鮮艷，潔白，美麗。飛機繞城往返再回到明故宮時，觀衆們掌聲不絕，以後兩人三人一組的跳，各學員於躍出機門，三秒鐘後將傘張開，傘之直徑爲六呎，百合花一朶兩朶的出現在晴空，我不禁向指揮敎官致敬。到第五次回到機塲上空時候，十二個人都跳完了，駕駛員見任備完畢，就朝向明故宮機塲著陸，這時正是二點鐘，最後一次是十二個人，從兩架機裏，同時降落。美麗的傘有純白的，黃的，紅的，綠的，冉冉下降，這是多麽含有詩意的藝術品啊！</p>
<p>最後白部長發表校閱觀感：「這是我們傘兵的幼芽，我們是一定要使他健壯成長，傘兵是最新的一種科學兵種，我們一定要把它建設起來，配合我們的國防。」</p>
<h3 id="c150">黑海風雲 <a href="#c150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>— 本報駐京記者丁維棟</p>
<p>最近黑海風雲，十分險惡。蘇聯對於達達尼裘海峽，已經正式提出蘇士共同設防的要求；並視之爲黑海國家的問題，不願英美法參加談判。而在英美土方面，則認爲這是一個國際問題，蒙德裏公約的修改，應該出之以國際會議的方式，不能由蘇聯片面的意志來決定。到現在，百萬以上的紅軍已經雲集於兩國邊境上，神經戰已經在進行中！土國國會中是一片反抗之聲，美國露骨的警告蘇聯：控制達峽控制亞洲會引起戰爭。戰爭的陰雲，似乎又籠罩在燼餘殘的歐洲上空了。</p>
<p>一國的政體會變，執政的人物會變，但是一國的歷史背境地理形勢是不會變的。帝俄也好，蘇聯也好，事實證明俄羅斯的民族願望是不會改變的。所以要了解海峽問題的本質，與其求之於堂皇的外交辭令，不如求之於俄國的歷史。</p>
<h3 id="c151">「君士坦丁世界霸權」 <a href="#c151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>現代俄國的興起，一共擊破了兩個強敵，在大彼德手裏，他打敗了當時稱雄北歐的瑞典，取得了波羅的海的海港，北方的「窗」是打開了；在南方，大彼得的繼承者凱撒女王，一再的打敗土而其，擴充國土，使俄國成爲黑海的國家。在整個十九世紀中，俄國致力於南進政策，而以取得君王坦丁堡控制黑海海峽爲最大的目標。一八〇五年法國拿破崙稱雄歐洲，在波闌平原上大敗俄重，但是爲了防禦英國，轉過手來接攏俄國，兩方訂立的爾西特（Tilsit）和約。這個條約的作用，在平分歐陸成爲法俄兩國的勢力範圍，西歐中歐歸法國，東歐北歐屬俄國。談判時一切順利，但是當俄皇提到君士坦丁堡時，拿破崙突然打斷他的話，沉重的說：「君士坦丁堡？這是有關世界霸權的問題！」雙方一再折衝，始終未得協議，這個未決的問題，最後成爲一八一二法俄邦交破裂的種子。從維也納會議到第一次世界大戰，巴爾幹戰禍頻仍，民族仇恨之外，帝俄想削弱土國控制海峽是個重要的原因。</p>
<h3 id="c152">海峽故事不盡滄桑 <a href="#c152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>在第一次世界大戰之初，英法爲拉攏俄國，牽制德國兵力全部集中西線起見，曾允許於戰爭結束之後，將君士坦丁堡及黑海海峽作爲帝俄的勝利果實。當時聖彼得堡得此諾言，爲之欣喜欲狂。一九一六年俄軍在東線敗績，軍心動搖，同時因土國參戰，俄國無法從黑海路線求得英法的接濟，處境十分困難。當時法國的駐俄大使（一位歷史家和文學家），在廢冬積雪的時候，在彼得堡看到帝俄新兵的行列，這些可憐的補充兵，衣衫不周，有的還是赤腳，因爲步鎗缺乏，有的竟是徒手兵，在雪地中掙扎著向前方開拔，這位大使問自己：俄國在這種危局之下，如何還有信心繼續作戰？他的結諭是「君士坦丁堡的美麗遠景，引導著他們前進！」</p>
<p>英國至今有一個看法：在首次大戰中，土國的態度相當猶豫，其所以和德國帶成一氣，是出於偶然的機會。當大戰發生的前夕，土國曾向英海軍部訂購軍艦，但是軍艦方好，歐洲戰形已成，英國把這艘軍艦留作自用，引起土國之不快。而在戰事發生的時候，有兩條德國軍艦逃過了英海軍的搜索，進入黑海海峽，停泊在君士坦丁堡。這一連串的事實，成爲德國拉攏土國的精神資本。以後在戰爭過程中，英國在邱吉爾主張之下，來了一次所謂「達達尼爾的冒險」，結果犧牲慘重，掃興而返。但歷史家事後的研究，認爲此舉如告成功，土國必然求降，將加速中歐諸國的失敗，而使歐戰早兩年結束！在歐戰結束之後，土國與希臘發生戰爭，希臘的侵略軍從土國內地一直退到海峽，土軍長驅逐北，本可渡過一衣帶水的海峽，規復歐洲的舊土，但是當時英海軍封鎖海峽，嚴陣以待。邱吉爾在回憶錄中生活的寫著：「海軍部有絕對的自信，就是純憑海軍的力量，可以阻止土軍進入歐洲」。洛桑條約成立後，土胃　了自力更生的機會，但是海峽成了不設防狀態，因此造成了新土耳其的遷都。這一次世界大戰的歷史敎訓，足以證明黑海海峽是土國國防的生命綫，如果海峽落入他國之手，土國的獨立將名存實亡！</p>
<h3 id="c153">英美態度主張共管 <a href="#c153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>在這次大戰中，土國應付危局，機警而自主，終於避免了捲入戰爭的漩渦。她雖沒有參戰，但是從一九四〇年六月起，全國始終在動員狀態中。美國的租借法案，亦應用到土國。根據英土互助協定，土國如受攻擊，非洲基地的英空軍，五分鐘內即可進至土國領空。土國空軍基地，悉由英美專家改造，以便兩國空軍隨時進駐。事實上，土國雖不參戰，但是屏障中東，替聯合國間接盡力不小。在這次戰爭，土國與德蘇兩國關係上，相當微妙，而且發生兩次事件，始終沒有水落石出。第一次是德國駐土大使巴本，在土京被刺未中。柏林說是蘇聯人員做的，目的造成土德戰爭，而便於紅軍進入土境。莫斯科說是德國特務做的，目的是替德軍製造侵略的藉口。土國的態度是緘默，而這件事亦始終沒有破案。第二次是德國公布一批文件和地圖，有關蘇聯預備對土國的領土要求，這事掀起軒然大波。德國堅稱材料來自蘇聯，十分可靠；而莫斯科則痛罵納粹，破壞蘇土邦交。在整個戰爭期內，土國是戰戰兢兢，唯恐大禍將臨，對於德蘇兩國，根本都不信任。而戰爭一結束，蘇聯的自治邦即向土國「索土」，使土國當局維持大軍，不敢復員！</p>
<p>在波茨坦會議中，蘇聯曾正式提出共同防禦達達尼爾海峽的要求。她所根據的是「國際平等」的原則，這裏所謂國際，是指英美蘇三強而言，並不是指其他國家、在會議席上，史達林指著邱吉爾說：「蘇彝士運河對於你是生存有關的水道，你把它佔領而設防了，」再指著杜魯門說：「巴拿馬運河對於你是生存攸關的水道，你把它佔領而設防了；因此，根據國際平等的原則，蘇聯有權要求防禦黑海海峽。」英美一致反對這個要求，而主張國際主管。邱吉爾當時表示：海峽如果成爲蘇聯的海軍基地，則只有俄國船出來，不會有英國船進去了！</p>
<h3 id="c154">北方大熊醉心海洋 <a href="#c154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>蘇聯之醉心於海峽的控制，除了完成歷史願望之外，英美方面有一種新的觀察，就是蘇聯對於海洋，發生了極深的興趣。在雅爾達會議中，貝爾納斯已經惑覺到。以後事實的發展，與此相符。在東方，蘇聯已取得旅順海軍基地——黃海中的直布羅陀。在西方，蘇聯支持南斯拉夫獲取的港，一則的港是重要的中歐之海口，同時的港的造船設備和熟練工人可以利用。對於義大利，她要求三分之一的艦隊和北非的海軍基地。預料她對於日本，必要要求賠償大部份的軍艦的商輪漁船。共管黑海海峽，可使蘇聯成爲地中海強國，發展勢力至非洲和近東。北方的大熊又想控制海洋，這和視海洋如生命綫的英美，當然利益衝突；在其他政治軍事重要理由之外，這是英美堅決支持土國動機之一。</p>

<h3 id="c155">日戰犯罪行　本報次料室　毒劊子手近衛文麿 <a href="#c155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>提起侵華元兇近衛文麿，凡是中國人莫不恨之切齒。雖然他已死了，但我們對這樣一個惡毒的劊子手，豈能讓他「一死了之」？</p>
<p>近衛在日本的潛勢力相當濃厚：他生於一八九一年，在父執西園寺手下撫養長大，曾隨西園寺出席過巴黎和會，久已獲得西園寺的衣缽，歸入日本「重臣」階級，組織了什麽東洋學會，南洋學會之類，暗中準備發動侵華戰爭。林銑十郞下台後，近衛起而組閣，一上合便發動「華北事件」，動員兵力三師團，飛機百餘架進攻平津；一方面標榜所謂「近衛三原則」與「不變不擴大方針」，我國軍人民衆因此受到不可估計的損失。但是他的陰謀，終於在我賢明的最高領袖指導抗戰之下，暴露無遺。接着又有所謂「近衛聲明」，提出「大東亞新秩序」與「長期作戰」的口號，都被我國當局攻擊得體無一完膚，不得不宣吿倒閣。</p>
<p>民國二十九年六月，近衛看到德國在歐洲軍事的順利，再度登台組閣，完成了「日德義軍事大同盟」的得意傑作。蘇德戰爭發生後，松岡去職，近衛內閣改組，更一味窮兵黷武，軍閥氣燄不可一世。平沼被刺後，近衛第三次內閣又吿崩潰。</p>
<p>綜計他從登塲到下塲，三度組閣。第一次組閣造成中日戰爭；第二次組閣勾結德義，陷於國際孤立；第三次組閣失敗後，東條上台而造成太平洋戰爭。</p>
<p>請看近衛對汪逆精衛談話中的一段：「日政府在今年屢次聲明中宣示始終期以武力澈底掃蕩抗日國民政府，同時願與中國有識之士携手向東亞新秩序之建造而邁退。日「滿」華三國共期實現善鄰友好，共同防共，和經濟提携。」中國人民受汪逆之凌虐，多半還是近衛的「功績」。</p>
<p>勝利後，近衛忽然又以親英美的作風出現，向盟軍頻送秋波，並且提倡修改憲法，希望能重出組閣。還異想天開地想到中國來「謝罪」。但這畢竟掩飾不了他滔天的罪行，在去年十二月六日，麥帥逮捕戰犯的名單中，近衛「名列前茅」，終於在是月十六日晨，畏罪仰藥自殺，遺書中還一味狡賴，稱：「至相當時期，是非自有公論！」可謂至死不悟。</p>

<p>近衛二次組閣，因對華戰費毫無辦法，國際空氣惡劣，法西斯軍人又不滿意，終於下台。繼之而起，担負「造成新秩序，維持東亞永久和平」重任的，正是這位僅做了七個月首相的平沼騏一郞男爵。</p>
<p>平　生於一九六七年，東京帝大法科畢業，供職司法部，一九一一年受司法大臣松田正久的賞識，任司法次官，一九一二年任大審院檢事總長達八年之久，一九二一年陞任大審院長，一九二三年，山本內閣成立，出任司法大臣，在司法界上樹立了牢不可拔的勢力。一九二四年，任　密院顧問官，翌年四月任樞院副議長，一九三大年任樞密院議長。</p>
<p>平沼是日本法西斯的領袖，他手創過修養團，自任理事，在一九二四年又創立國本社，自任社長，高唱「皇室中心主義」，刋行「國本」及「國本新聞」。會員中網羅日本官僚·軍關·貴族等各界在內。鈴木　三郞，東鄕平八郞·驚藤實，荒木貞夫，小磯國昭，松井石根，菊池武夫，及財閥池田成彬，官僚學者山川健次郞等都是該社會員。他還和荒木貞夫合作過，竭力抨擊　會，幾番想出而組閣，都因反對者作粳而沒有成功。</p>
<p>一九三九年，平沼終於以七十三歲之高齡，償了他生平的願望，可是上任未及兩月，已遭各方猛烈抨擊，內閣成爲軍部附庸，無權干涉對外政策，一切悉爲陸相坂垣，文相荒木等所把持，是年八月即吿倒閣。一九四〇年曾一度出任內相，嗣任副首相，一九四五年復任樞密院議長。</p>
<p>去年十二月二日在麥帥所下令逮捕的五十九名戰犯中，平沼亦在其內，這八十歲的法西斯「功臣」終於瑯璫下獄，聽候國際法庭的審判了。</p>

<p>橋本欣五郞原是一個標準的日本浪人，在窮兵點武的日本法西斯政府中，居然也成爲一個了不起的人物。</p>
<p>橋本是「日本靑年黨」的黨魁，又是「黑龍會」的首領，他荒誕地自命爲超等納粹主義者，曾那麼說過：「國社主義與法西斯主義像晚空的星月，只有布大日本的晨曦中可以點綴得更明顯，」名作家約翰根室稱他是「一黨觀念的始祖，一個極其暴戾的少壯軍官。」又由於他幕後「黑龍會」的支持，經常生活於刦掠，暗殺與陰諜之中，造成了他可怕的聲名。</p>
<p>一九二七年任駐土大使館副官時，他已醉心於硏究德義納粹政治，到一九三六年由於他的靑年黨得勢，組成了一個文武官僚合併式的法西斯政府，發表「飛躍的大日本國家體制大綱」的宣言，（亦稱橋本欣五郞宣言）高喊着「天皇第一」與「國家統制管理」的口號。</p>
<p>一九三七年重入陸軍，指揮確兵艦隊侵華，造成慘絕人寰的南京火屠殺，並指揮轟擊美艦「巴納」號及英艦「飄虫」號。他著有大量作品，在「太陽大日本」雜誌及其他刋物上發表文章，並作公開演說。現已提交國際法庭作為物證的「革新的不可避免性」一書，就是他的「大作」，內中透露他在長江中溺斃我軍時，萬分欣喜，並欲驅逐在中國之英美勢力，實現日本的獨佔計劃。他又常用陰謀來推倒他所認爲「進取心不够」的文武官員。一九四〇年並爲大政翼贊會的創辦人。</p>
<p>這橫行不法的軍閥已在東京國際法庭受審，大家都希望把這條「老黑龍」予以最嚴厲的懲罰！</p>

<p>— 鎭江七日訊　王寒鷗</p>
<p>當記者和常地商人走出海安土城的時候，路上就看到一大聲共軍拋散在地面上的傳單標語，大家都懷着戰戰兢兢的戒心。據懷着鬼胎的一兩個人說：他們還看見遠處的樹林裏，有民兵在偸偸偵察。無論這話是眞是假，但一出土城，就有共軍活動，那是的確的事實。並且在這事前，海安就有了被合圍的情象；一到夜晚，手溜彈和機槍聲，成了按時出演的節奏。但駐軍和居民，並不加以過分的注視，祇有拿鎭靜兩字來沉着應付而已，這是對付共軍戰略的唯一好方法，也是適應當前環境的唯一好方法。因爲國軍自打通通揚綫後，需要一番整理與佈置，以備作次期作戰的規劃，它並沒有向北伸進，沿公路各城鎭，沒有「衛星」據點，共軍一作「反攻」，馬上兵臨城下，除了深溝高壘堅決守衛而外，是別無再好的辦法了。</p>
<p>工事整齊</p>
<p>記者在鎭上時，土城裏的碉堡，防禦工事，都築得整整齊齊。駐在鎭上的是六十五師，他們裏面好像個個都是工兵，都會做泥水匠，弟兄們自己挑磚頭，和泥灰，砌造碉堡。他們分住在民家，每個駐地的門前，也都砌好掩避短牆。每條街巷都堆置了障碍物，作着一切巷戰的準備，這些砌造堡壘的磚石，是挖自後街僻巷裏的路磚，木頭門板是向住戶臨時徵集的，也有少數的瓦木匠參加在裏面工作。</p>
<p>儲榖死守</p>
<p>海安區長王景怡，召集市民開會時，宣佈全鎭居民集體儲榖一萬二千担，作一個月圍城的準備，由各公會督導各商戶，保甲長督導各住戶，設法搜購，各自儲存，到額滿一萬二千石，口食充裕爲止。記者在鎭上時，居民均領臨時通行證，每天出城到附近鄕戶去購買米草，米價新米最低曾小到三萬四千元，但不久又回升到四五萬元一石，草便每担漲至八九千元，和每石一百三十斤的大麥價格相等，很多人都劈舊傢具作炊薪，雖然忍痛，但據說比較「挨貴價」要合算。</p>
<p>公路四達</p>
<p>海安土城是在淪陷期中僞軍所築，當時耗費民間血汗頗多。新四軍「解放」該地時，因爲他們感覺該地「必不可失」，所以幸蓮地，這土城不但未被拆毀，而且加工修葺，直至共軍退出該鎮時，這是完好無缺。加之城內外又有護城河兩道，這完全適合深溝高壘的條件。海安有怎樣「必不可失」的關係呢？它是連接東南西北的交通孔道，南路往通（州）如（皋），西路往揚（州）泰（縣），東路往栟（茶）李（堡）入海，北路往東（台）鹽（城），直達淮（陰）海（州），日前這些綫路且均有公路可通。總之，——海安——是交通的中心點，有了它可以控制載局，沒有它一大段公路綫就要被迫完全放棄。</p>
<p>民主官司</p>
<p>在抗戰中媲美於吳佩孚的前江蘇省長韓國鈞，就出身在鎭上。民卅年地方淪陷時，韓氏避難東北鄉，被敵寇派兵下鄕刧持，要其出任僞職，但韓堅貞自矢，臨危不屈，結果　志以殁。韓氏字紫石，新四軍「民主政府」假惺惺地特定該鎭名「紫石縣」，以紀念他的勞蹟，但因他的女兒韓柳　，是地方上三資階級之一，今年春天發動鬥爭時，也把她捉去吃「民主官司」，直到蘇北大戰將發動時，才被放出，現在柳閑女士也在鎭上主持軍民聯合辦事處和商會，擘劃興復地方事宜。</p>
<p>鳳山戰局</p>
<p>報紙電傳激載在城東北麓山，但海安並無麓山，也無北麓山，想係離鎭二里的東北角鳳山之誤。鳳山是海安三塘十景之一，風景優美，形似鳳凰，登山巔可以俯瞰全城，爲了控制戰局，當然雙方非誓死爭奪這高地不可了。鳳山上的廟宇，前被共軍拆去一部份，三塘十景，已經有善殘敗不全的現象；共軍摧毀廟宇的手段，的確厲害，海安廣福寺，爲下河廿四　林之一，建築比上海靜安寺還要偉大，也被共軍拆得七零八落，共軍「民主政府」所宣稱的「宗敎信仰有自由，」這話不知又說到那裏去了。</p>
<p>居民待哺</p>
<p>海安，目前是　北爭奪戰中的　個重地，軍民都在危城裏死守着，雖然共軍十二團兵力的攻勢已經衰弱，情勢已見鬆動，但對外交通仍沒有恢復，工商各業全在窒息狀態中。市民每天應付着戰爭，應付着生活，物價又是驚人奇昂，從國軍推進到現在，還沒有得着一點救濟物品，前傳行總蘇寗分署有五百噸麵粉運來，專爲救濟姜·曲·海。災區，但是曲塘區公路被截斷了，暫時難望運來，一般貧民，眞如「涸轍之鮒」，望眼欲穿了。</p>
<h3 id="c159">水災共禍煎迫下的海州 <a href="#c159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>— 本報三日海州訊　通訊員李尙農</p>
<p>海州在過去是一個偏僻的角落，自海禁洞開，隴海築路後，形成了蘇北心臟，海岸的大門，司時爲淮海地區軍事·政治·文化·經濟的重鎮，前有沃野數百里盛產豆麥，後有廣大的鹽田，和吐納貨物的通雲大港，中外人士，無不矚目。</p>
<p>現在所有地方軍事，政治及文化·金融機關，均設於距海州城十二華里的新浦，商業異常繁榮。陸上交通：有隴海鐵路，靑海公路，淮海公路。水上交通：從連雲港直航上海。靑島·廣東·大連·廈門等地。內有運鹽河，可以航行淸江。事變前，中國航，空公司在海州設有航空站，每日有南北航機降落，搭載乘客，運輸郵件，交通頗稱便利。</p>
<p>春天三四月間，難民唯一的希望，是共軍快快的退出海屬，讓人民回家收麥。等到五月麥黃時，海屬各縣流亡難民，曾經自動組織還鄕隊，分途回家收麥，不料各路民衆返鄕隊，均爲共軍槍砲擊回，所種之麥子，皆被共軍收割運走。</p>
<p>流亡的難民，見麥子已被共軍割去，生機斷絕，他們雖蒙救濟總署撥發麵粉，及地方當局設法救濟，但以杯水車薪，大家仍難免飢餓之苦，有不少的難民，由新浦向江南逃亡找出路，現在新浦難民尙有四萬四千七百零六人，較春天要少了二分之一强，這四萬餘的難民，終日盼望回家，因爲秋天已經到了，馬上就要棉衣穿，如再不能回家，凍餒就更難挨了。</p>
<p>破壞交通封鎖食糧</p>
<p>共軍佔據沭贛兩縣城後，復於一月間，違反停戰侖令，破壞交通，攻佔隴海路白塔埠，向西等處，强抽壯丁，殺害逃避兵役家屬，屢次進攻海州外園據點，新壩，張瀔等莊，灌雲縣近郊據點葛莊，亦時遭共軍進擊。</p>
<p>共軍雖不　向海灌兩縣外圍據點進襲，但地方團隊在國軍段霖茂將軍指揮之下，沉着防衛，共軍每次進攻，無不遭受痛擊，尋海國軍，曾舉行節省一餐飯運動，救濟海新難民，軍民互愛如家人，精誠團結，保衛淮海據點的海州。共軍見海州無法攻取，乃加强其封鎖政策，因爲出產糧栗的地區，皆被其佔踞，我方所肪守的，僅剩東灌兩縣城及新浦，連雲港等近郊地區，所產食糧寥寥，自食糧燃料被共軍封鎖後，糧價高漲，民食恐慌，其他物價亦隨之昂貴。</p>
<p>海州南北西三面首被共軍封鎖，祇有東面的連雲港海面，可以交通出入，輪船來往靑島，運輸點布疋雜貨，如若沒有連雲港這個海口，簡直呼吸。都將要被窒息了。</p>
<p>新浦原有各業商店，公司，鹽號，大小的七百家，商業非常繁榮，自城新外顯曁隴海被共軍攻佔封鎖後，商業一落千丈，各商店紛紛倒閉，商業旣不好，工業亦隨之而沒落，其他跑單帮做小生意的，因交通斷絕，無法經營，新浦失業賦閒的人，的七八千人，有不少失業窮苦的人，日無一餐，面呈菜色，佈滿了新城的角落，地方機關職員及學校敎員，因待遇低微，物價高貴，大多數　腹辦公，眞有說不出的痛苦。生活愉快的，惟有未捕的漢奸，發國難財的奸商，和少數發勝利的貪官等，其餘的人，均在悽苦中過日子。</p>
<p>掘堤放水淹沒秋禾</p>
<p>淮海地區共軍，因蘇北戰事失利，竟不顧民命，將沭。運河兩堤掘開，波浪洶湧，洪水橫流，徐州東南，海屬全境，除山嶺地帶外，均成澤國，人民房舍，牲畜，冲倒淹死極多，田內半熟之豆類，芝蔴，山芋等秋禾，悉被淹沒，被淹面積，的三百餘平方里。</p>
<p>魯南共軍、意圖淹沒海州城及新浦，復將臨沂縣境，沂河堤防挖開，河水東流，與沭運兩河之水匯合，向海新地區漫流，新浦北　薇河年久淤塞，宣洩不暢，以致海灌兩縣城郊，水深數尺，海州至新浦公路，已被冲斷，楊圩飛機塲，有被浸漫趨勢。</p>
<p>新浦地方軍民，深恐　圩飛機塲及街市被水浸人，乃於二十三·二十四兩日合力趕築新浦西橋外鹽河防堤，並將飛機塲防堤決口數處堵塞，軍民在火傘高張，揮汗如雨下，努力工作，毫無倦容，洪水雖不能淹沒海州，但海灌連地區數十萬人民食糧燃料來源斷絕、是目前最嚴重的問題。</p>

<p>生活陷絕境孤苦伶仃殊堪憐</p>
<p>編輯先生：家父歸鴻，號仲飛，今年卅三歲，失蹤於民國卅年春季，原因是這樣的：廿六年一月，我的母親因生產而死了！至秋季又因日寇侵略，就由我父同祖母帶領我和二個妹妹逃亡至鄕間，後來叉在一擊小舟上，我們過着流浪的生活，到過高郵·如皋·南通·鹽城等地，不知是什麽時候，大的是廿九年的秋季，我們到了五光十色的上海，這是富人的天堂，也就是窮人的地獄；到上海三個月以後，不幸的我們姊妹三人同時出起　子來，貧病交迫，父親又找不到職業，每大過着借貸的生活，徼倖的我們姊妹的病稍愈了，祖母爲了要减輕愛子的重負，就回到了生活費比較低的故鄉——常熟。那時常熟還被日寇佔居着，我爸爸怕受辱於日寇，就留在上海，起初還　着信，終於有一次我給爸爸的信被退回了，託人探聽也是徒然，直到如今，還是生死未明，不知不覺父親失蹤已整整的五年了！我們姊妹三人，在祖母的撫育下，過了幾年不懂事的孩子生活，可是老天對我們似乎特別苛刻，在前年秋季，又奪了我的祖母，祖母死後我們生活的變遷是寫不畫的，總之我們的生路快走完了！我天天盼望爸爸能見報速回，救女兒於水深火熱中，同時我也希望仁人君子能知我父下落者，寫信至「常熟焦桐街四十七號醫枚收」，我是十六歲的女孩子，去年剛畢業初中，爲經濟關係，沒有升學，國文也沒有一點根基，還得請先生指正，並予發表爲感。敬祝撰安孤兒歸枚。棻·榕同啓</p>

<p>— 李瑩</p>
<p>我國是有五千年燦爛史的一個禮義之邦，倫理觀念始終很尊嚴的存在着，父母愛護子女，子女孝敬尊親，夫和妻睦，兄禮弟悌，每個家庭都很融洽。不過，往往有許多家庭，娶了一位媳婦進來，就發生了隔膜猜妒，使和好的空氣一變而爲充滿陰霾憂憤，以致整個家庭分子都不渝快，倒是爲了什麽呢？</p>
<p>我們的祖先是在大家庭制度下生活的。到現在大家庭制仍沒有根絕，在都市中，思想較新的男女，才摔脫了桎梏，另建小家庭。「大」和「小」不是制度的改變，而且二十世紀生活趨向角度的轉移。在大家庭中，媳婦是最不易做，殺不討好的職務；她周旋於公婆妯娌間，假如丈夫的兄弟姐妹多的話，那更變成衆矢之的，常常是他們談笑的資料，冷嘲熱諷的目的物。而她呢？祇有忍受，她知道這是一生中必經的階段，也是舊制度下必然的結果，除了在丈夫前略得一點安慰，或把希望全部寄托在孩子身上外，她祇有在默默的安排好的命運下挨過去。她相信「念年媳婦念年婆，再是念年做太婆」，她知道做媳婦是什麽一會事，做婆婆又是什麽一會事，在嘗够念年媳婦滋味後，她又依樣待遇她的媳婦，與其說待遇，不如說報復。一代一代循環下去，思想逐漸新穎的下一代，到不能再忍受這一種「忍受」的時候，於是爭執，反抗，能自立的就脫離而另組小家庭，大半仍舊苟延下去的，她的環境當然更惡劣了。</p>
<p>組織小家庭後，她的地位無形提高，現在不是媳婦而是妻子甚或母親，她不再受拘束了。妻子對於丈夫是並行的，她在適當的侍奉，體貼外，不需要過分的伺候和屈服，也沒有誰再故意欺侮她，再使她難堪。當然這種生活也不免小缺憾，譬如說在經濟感到困難的時候，有賓客而自己忙不過來的時候，孩子太多招顧不及的時候，……有家人在一起，至少可以帮她一些忙，然而比起好處來，到底是算不了一回事的。</p>
<p>現在該談態度，在不能避免的大家庭中，做長輩的應該用寬恕。慈愛。樂觀的眼光，抱着不痴不龔不作阿家翁的精神，而且兒孫自有兒孫福，不必妒嫉咒駡；而做媳婦的，該時時想到他們是她的長輩，應該孝順，應該尊敬，理解老年人心理突存的變態，而且天天在一起，扯破了臉，又有什麽興味呢？兩方各在退一步想的態度下，一定能融融洽洽，安怡愉快的。</p>
<p>雖然，時至今日，我們實在也沒有維持大家庭制的必要了。</p>
<h3 id="c166">育兒三禁 <a href="#c166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>— 蘊玉</p>
<p>下面是關於育兒的三件大事，希望做母親的特別注意：</p>
<p>（一）不要讓人家吻你的孩子許多人因爲愛孩子，往往喜與孩子接吻。這是件很普遍的事，做母親的，十九不加注意。其實，我們知道：在接吻時，彼此呼出的空氣，會相互吸進；如果吻孩子的人患有疾病，很能由此傳染。你如果要你的孩子保持康健，快快禁止人家吻你的孩子罷！</p>
<p>（二）不要欺騙和恐嚇你的孩子　孩子是好奇的，常他遇到一件沒有見過的事，便會問：「這是什麼？」「爲什麽會這樣的？」做母親的就應該把所以然告訴孩子，如果不知道，就率直地回答不知，絕對不可以假話哄騙他，甚至威嚇他。若孩子提出的問題時常給你哄騙過去，威嚇下去，則孩子的腦中，將滿存虛偽和　懼，且其好奇心亦將因之减退，甚或消滅。試想：人沒有好奇心，則一切科學技術，如何能日新月異？我希望各位做母親的格外注意。</p>
<p>（三）不要讓人家撫摸你孩子的生殖器很多人常喜撫摸男孩的生殖器，做母親的，也大都以爲這是無關緊要的。如果這樣日積月累地下去，很能使孩子大了犯手淫，手淫的弊病，大家都曉得，用不到贅述。同時，孩子自己撫弄生殖器，也要絕對禁止才好。</p>
<h3 id="c167">美容的要訣　保護皮膚 <a href="#c167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>— 淸</p>
<p>往往有些女子，身段上雖然長得很苗條，可是由於她們面孔上的脂粉敷得過厚的緣故，在一顰一笑的時候，都顯不出一點皮膚的光澤來，完全好像一個着了顏色的石膏像，表示不出任何神情似的。這時候假如有人在旁邊一眼看見，一定會覺得很不順眼，替她們的皮膚生出一種憐惜的感覺來。</p>
<p>我們能够斷定，一個女子的外貌，首先着重於面部，而面部的美與不美，又在於她的皮膚是吾鮮艷與潤澤而定。說到這裏，也許又有人會提出疑問，究竟一個女十的皮膚如何纔能保持了光澤和鮮艷呢？</p>
<p>我們要保持皮膚的美觀，首先要能保護皮膚，使得它不因受外界的刺激而受虧損，凡是一切含有大量鉛質的東西，以及過少量的睡眠，都是最會刺激皮膚的。所以日常喜歡擦比較濃厚的而含多量鉛質的脂粉的女人，常常會皮膚粗糙，毛孔漲大，一個患失眠症或是熬夜的女人也常有面皮粗糙而乾枯的現象，就是這個緣故，因此營養皮膚的第一件要事，便是要小心的保護皮膚。</p>
<p>其次，使皮膚淸潔也是一條營養皮膚的方法，所以在可能的範圍內，最好少與汚穢與多灰的地方相接觸，因爲不潔的東西裏，都含有一種毒素，足以吸收皮膚的脂澤而使它枯燥。假如不可能的話，那末在你奔走回來之後，用淸潔的溫水與香皂，把臉上的灰塵洗去，也是一種補救的辦法；但是在洗去灰土之後，臉上原有的脂澤也跟着肥皂一同褪去，所以這時候我們應當用點養料去營養它，例如鷄蛋白，甘油，以及萍果，橘子，番茄等水果的汁液，都是很好的營養皮虞的原料。（以上一類的京西，最好用在臨睡之前，代替肥皂而除去汚垢。等到次日早晨起身後，再用淸水洗，皮膚就能顯得光潤柔滑了。）此外，當冬令天氣寒冷的時候，可用脂酸類化裝品（雪花膏）塗敷面部，以防皮膚的　裂。</p>
<p>如果一個女子臉部的皮膚，已經達到了淸潔而細膩的地步，那末再在她的皮膚上，施以薄薄的一層脂粉，以爲掩蓋臉上過份的油脂與補救蒼黃的面色而用，然後在這一層薄粉上，敷以少許的胭脂，便能够使皮膚顯出而生動的健康美了。</p>

<p>（一）生活的支路</p>
<p>常我年幼的時候，常當跟年輕的弟兄們爭噪，甚而口角，因甚我們都是剛愎成性，各行各素的。</p>
<p>一天父親帶我們上火車站去玩，看到一列火車自兩邊風馳電掣而來，同時東邊又有一列貨車亦疾馳西來。</p>
<p>「你們想什麽事將發生，道二列火車在同一軌這上，向對方行駛？」父親問我們。</p>
<p>我們睜大了眼睛，想可怕的撞車即將發生，但是在我們注視之下，那列貨車却駛上了支路，讓那客車安穩地飛逝而去。</p>
<p>「看！孩子們！」父親解釋道：「人們也好似火車，我們都在同一軌道上，向各方邁進，假使沒有支路設備，人與人間就有裂隙存在，眞如撞車一樣，幸而我們有着很多此種設備，諸如忍耐，友愛，寬容等都是，所以孩童間，成人間，甚而國際間，假使他們都能時常體念到生活上的支路，那末他們之間一定能更融和一些。」</p>
<p>（二）彈不虛發</p>
<p>我父親已允許我可以買第一枝口徑〇·二二來復槍，許多日子來我翻閱着郵定的目錄，最後決定選擇完全自動一次進續十五響的一枝。於是我請我們的保鑣平君，對於我的揀選加以同意，但是他看了看這槍的圖畫，然後微笑的轉向我說：「假使我是你的話，我就不要這一枝。」</p>
<p>「爲什麽呢？」我抑制着自己的失望問他。</p>
<p>他說：「我以爲單發的較佳，每次你看到這單發的槍，你一定會想到，假使這次射得不中，就沒有第二次機會了。但是，用了一枝自動的就不同，你再不注意於每顆子彈的重要，結果就不能做到你所能做到最好的一步。</p>
<p>平君的理論的確很完美。從此以後，無諭在事業上或社交上，我總常常想到他的話，彈不虛發。</p>
<p>（三）錶面與錶裏</p>
<p>我記得當我十一歲的某一日，我哭着返家，因爲在敎堂裏的兒童節目中我祇是派不關重要的後台。而我的遊伴却指派爲主角。</p>
<p>母親靜默地拿出她的錶，再放在我手中。</p>
<p>「你看到什麽？」她問我。</p>
<p>「金殼子錶面跟指針。」我回答。</p>

<h3 id="c169">羅賽蒂 <a href="#c169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>— 龐多爾</p>
<p>但丁。蓋白里。羅賽蒂Dante　Gabriel　Rossetli是詩人，也是畫家。他終身獻力於藝術，創立「前拉菲爾」畫派，領導雜多利亞後期的詩人藝人如摩立斯William　morris，本瓊斯Burne-Jones，斯溫本Swinburne等從事於獨立的創作。他的畫，興詩齊名。然而寗可說詩中有畫，不宜說畫中有詩。因爲他人手的主要點是色彩與氣氛，不是動作的敍寫。</p>
<p>羅賽蒂的藝術天性，源於他的血統。他的父親是個義大利文人，因爲他的革命思想，避居在倫敦。他的母親是義人與英人結合所生。因此羅賽蒂家裏兄妹四人都含有義大利人的藝術才能，在藝術上也都有相當的成就；但是但丁，蓋白里最年長，也最享盛名。</p>
<p>一八二八年五月十二日，羅賽蒂誕生於倫教時，他的家正是義國奔命者的聚集處。他從幼年便看到政治人物的一切活動，反而使他對於政洽發生厭惡；就連對祖國義大利的獨立運動，也不感到熱忱。他所以愛義大利完全是爲了文藝。</p>
<p>羅賽蒂十四歲人藝術學校，十八歲進皇家學院的舊院Autlque　School　of　the　Royal　Academy，除了繪畫外，又酷愛勃朗寗的詩。這時他開始對中古的文化與社會認識，便譯了許多義大利中古時代的詩及但丁的新生vita　Nu　ova；刋印後成爲羅賽蒂的第一部作品，也是早期義國詩的標準英譯本。</p>
<p>一八四八年羅賽蒂正式與朋友亨特Holman　Hunt，米萊Millais創立了「前拉菲爾社」Pre-Raphaelite　Brotherbood，主張恢復拉菲爾Raphael以前義大利畫家純潔簡單的作風。這是對當時專重技巧墨守成法的匠畫的反動。他們的結論是：拉菲爾畫技太完善，使後人無法自闢途徑，遂使藝術低落。以故要改革藝術，必須超越技巧，表現靈魂，要先回復到拉菲爾前的藝術空氣，然後自由創作，方能有成績。他們的繪畫裏，題材，色澤，結構及各種細處，都盡與時人不同，不求取悅俗世。最顯著的一點，便是他們不屑色彩表面的調和，祗用基本的强烈的顏色。這種精神他們又表現於詩。他們出版的刊物「種子」The　Germ中，含有羅賽蒂最著名的詩「幸福的天女」The　Blessed　Damozel。</p>
<p>在這時羅賽蒂遇見少女依利撒白，息德爾Elizabeth　Siddall。她有細長的身段，藍灰色的眼睛，豐滿的嘴唇，金黃的頭髮，正合中古美人的條件，使愛古美的羅賽蒂沉醉，以她作像，繪了悲阿特里絲Beatrice等名作。終於羅賽蒂娶了她爲妻。可是他的脾氣是那樣古怪，生活是那樣無規律，使她感到異常孤獨，不久染上肺病。一夜當羅賽蒂回家時，發現他的妻死在牀上。他在悲痛之餘，將數年的詩稿，盡以陪葬，以示懺悔。多年後他聽了朋友的勸吿，方又將詩稿從墓內掘出。</p>
<p>一八五四年，羅賽蒂認識了名批評家勒斯金Ruskin。勒斯金對他極加贊助，樹立了他在藝術界的地位。隨後摩立斯，本瓊斯等都受羅賽蒂的影響，棄學作畫。後進作家也多崇拜摹倣他。可是當他喪妻後，身心漸感不適。而那時勃坎能Buchanan等攻擊他的詩，說是太偏重記述五官的感覺，過份沉浸於聲色。他們的譏刺使他很覺得難堪，然而他仍不斷的寫作，直至一八八二年，五十四歲時，中風而死。</p>
<p>他的詩都是以極隨意的風格寫成，都含同一的思想，就是男人愛女人，象徵着上帝愛人類，而女人可愛之處象徵靈魂的美麗。他以爲「生命」就是「愛」「生命」和「愛」是同一物，因爲「愛」是宇宙的推動力，沒有「愛」就沒有了「生命」。（圖：羅賽蒂自畫像）</p>

<p>— 張白懷</p>
<p>「在一個黃昏裏，我看見你頽裏地　着頭，在綠色的田陌上躑躅，到後來又親見你擴大着喉嚨狂熱地唱歌，你究竟是作着期待，抑是作　什麽必要的召尋呢？」</p>
<p>「不，我祇是隨着自己的高與而已。」</p>
<p>「那我祈有爲你的歌聲惆悵。正如可　　麗的朝陽空對寂寞的樓窗。但你那時有沒有注意我們從你的背後走過呢？並且她曾低聲的說，你的眼睛一定爲什麽疑難的思慮迷戀住了。」</p>
<p>「迷惑住了，是的，你們却又爲什麽就這樣的走過去了呢？」</p>
<p>「你那時沉吟着，說站立在時日的廢墟之上，想用愛情的金磚來重建滿目的荒凉；但躊躇在昨天與明日之間。怕祇拾得一個繁華的夢想。她幾乎忍不住要發笑了，但我們終於沒有驚動你。」</p>
<p>「我實在不明白，何以畏懼靈魏的蒼白甚至於思想的空虛。這些日子來，你也看出我游移於心靈底里的寂寞嗎？」</p>
<p>「寂寞的人是沒有愛的，面你，愛的火　把你的生命也燒得通紅了。」</p>
<p>「唉，雖然我說，我比以前更加懂得生命的意義。然而在感情的書册上，我還沒有翻到過這樣難以索解的雜亂的一篇，我請敎所有的友人，但到現在還沒有誰能够領悟，他們都說那無字的辭句過於空茫，　隱而又艱澀。所以，我是長久地這樣懷疑，懷疑那上面記述着一個不幸的孩子，曾經怎樣的用懦弱和眼淚，憤然但却無力地把痛苦投擲於萎靡的命運之林裏…」</p>
<p>「你對自己有是過於放任，但現在却是一個可怕的苛求。」</p>
<p>「但是有一位詩人這麼吿訴了我，他說：當你無力繼續前行的時候，你就站在道傍看到行人。我覺得這才是眞正的殘酷。」</p>
<p>「你這回則是輕信了自己。」</p>
<p>「不不，我豈竟對自己也一無所知？我行走在一條狹隘的谷道上，那旁邊生長的不是繁花雜樹，而是荆棘叢莽，走動在前後四方的不是行人旅客，而是野獸豹　，……」</p>
<p>「那是你已經沒有意志，繼續攀登那夢裏所縈迴的這路了！」</p>
<p>「我可實在也沒有想過動搖和退　，我熱烈的心却是如此孤獨的。」</p>
<p>「那末你可也聽到一個詩人說　？他的悲哀同時就是他的喜樂，也許你的苦惱正同時是你的崇高吧。」</p>
<p>「　，那邊祗好如此安慰。記得我曾暗自想過，倘使眞的有人願意把自己拿來解剖，而在他動手之先，又復聲明這被解剖的生命係已經死亡，作爲一次最後的存在之回顧，也許沒有誰甘心殘忍，予他以嚴酷的精神的責備……」</p>
<p>「可是，這就是你整個究全的自己嗎？」</p>
<p>「唉，你定必是驚異於我的貧乏。我所想的艱深而表現的浮淺，或者是因爲我失去的太多，而所得的太少了！」</p>
<p>「我不願化費過多的時間去探求你的心之底秘。你可以驕傲發亮的前額上的汙珠，而不必慚愧你沒有爲更多的人做得更好。你走吧，如果嘲笑和妒嫉繼續，你就不容情地，用眞理的憎惡，擲給他們一顆冰冷的心！」</p>
<h3 id="c171">海湼的悲劇生涯 <a href="#c171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>— 李廈</p>
<p>哈因律希海湼，是一個浪漫的熱情詩人，可是他的一生是苦痛的薄命。在二元的矛盾之間，終生含辛茹苦，不得翻身。物質與精神，理想與現實，愛與恨，熱情與冷酷，自尊與失望，這種種矛盾的兩頭蛇，不斷地向他侵害着。</p>
<p>「我的心，我的心的悲苦。</p>
<p>雖然被這五月的淸麗的陽光所照射着，</p>
<p>我躑躅倚於菩提樹下，</p>
<p>在那高高的古城的傍邊。</p>
<p>我的胸中是海一般的汹湧，</p>
<p>也有颶風，也有潮汐，</p>
<p>雖然說是有美麗的珍珠，</p>
<p>然而是深沉海底。」</p>
<p>……還鄕紀</p>
<p>上面這一首小詩，正是反映了詩人的心底悲哀。詩人於一七九七年生於萊茵河畔的留賽爾德爾夫市。該市本是德意志領地，在當時却是屬於法蘭西的統治，所以在他的「備忘錄」裏說：</p>
<p>「自己是生當懷疑的十八世紀末期，並且我的幼年時代，不僅是法蘭西人，還是生於被法蘭西精神所支配着的都市。」</p>
<p>而作爲猶太人種而扶養了他的雙親，正好也是兩個極端的勢力。母親是賦有德意志風的精勤的實際的女性，由於她有着要把兒子造成一個官吏的心理，所以命他去學法律。然而，父親却是一個賦有法蘭西風的輕快的享樂的樂天主義的人物，對於兒子的敎養，並不給予怎樣的有效的設施。在這樣的空氣裏，詩人海湼便開始了他的矛盾的人生的首途</p>
<p>詩人憑着他母親的意志，十九歲時便移居到哈慕布爾克地方去從事於法律的修業，曾經有一時期他夢想着將來他要成為辯護士或學校的敎授，也曾經度過了三個月的初戀生活。而特別是這三個月的初戀結果，使他不得不踏上了宿命的悲哀。其實爲詩人所仰慕的對方，並不曾持有怎樣的心情的，這痛苦的經騐的殘痕，便首先在他的詩篇上投下了一個黑影子。在他第一部詩集「歌本」的前半部裏面，瀰漫着他的對於過去的惡夢忍痛的悲哀的調子。</p>
<p>當他離開這個「苦惱的搖籃」的哈慕布爾克市是在一八一九年的夏天，因爲得到了他叔父的資助，他入了蒙市的大學去學法律。在蒙市，他交了許多有着高度愛國精神的學生聯盟裏的朋友，他看到了學生聯盟的被解散，他參加了克羅逸麥爾克的盛大的戰勝紀念祭，於是在他的心理上次第的極成了反抗鬥爭的思想。</p>
<p>一八二一年春，他開始在柏林生活，在這繁盛的大都會中，他受到了光明與黑暗兩方面的更深的影響。但是在這裏他所特別感到痛苦的問題，是人種的差別觀念。作爲猶太人而屢屢遭受難堪的輕視的待遇的他，凡事都表示他的憤懣與反感，在這裏他逐漸增强了他的反抗氣氛，終於參加了「猶太人文化科學會」，執筆爲文，甚至到處進行他的宣傳活動。</p>
<p>一八二五年，終於通渦了那個討厭的卒業試騐，得到了博士的頭銜。並且由於他叔父的帮助，又去北海旅行。海是詩人所特別愛好的，由於海的引導，他終於又渡海去英國。海漸漸地引導他走向自然的懷裏，促進這生來的漂泊兒的旅情。漫遊的結果，他寫成了「北海」，「哈律茲紀行」等宏篇，而於一八二七年出版了「歌本」一作，便確立了他的詩人的名聲。</p>
<p>但是在詩集中所表現的思想上政治上的意見，到處招致了落後勢力的反對與攻擊。甚至有一部份受到了普魯士政府的發賣禁止，他的身邊逐漸增加了幻滅與不遇的壓迫，於是詩人於一八三一年的五月到了法國巴黎。</p>
<p>在巴黎的第一個印象，是十分强烈而新鮮的，對於拉夫安推虜，盧騷，拿破崙，以及其他一切法蘭西的偉大的過去的懷想，是潮水一般地在他的胸中洶湧着。允其是比較一切更有興趣的牽記的是聖西門的新的宗敎說。這學說使他在從來的德謨克拉西的見解與生成的貴族的藝術主義的中間，找到了調停。這學說是主張把舊的不平等廢除，代替了這個的是期待着不尙因襲的由於個性的能力而築成的新的階級。同時由於得到芳齡二十的女子馬推爾德的戀愛同居，使他的熱情更旺熾地燃燒起來，使他能以民衆的苦惱爲自家的苦惱，而以民衆的社會的向上的急先鋒自任。</p>
<p>「我是利劍，我是火燄。請在我的棺上放着一把劍吧。我是在人類的自由戰爭中的一個勇敢的戰士。」</p>
<p>他是這樣地叫喊着，雖然被巴黎人所排斥。然而他終於作爲一個祖國的救助者而站立起來，作爲一個民衆的擁護者而站立起來。</p>
<p>但是海涅終於還是個「爲藝術而藝術」的詩人，由於生來富於敏感，所以他的愛憎的程度當常要越出常軌，於是詩人晚年的詩作，把先前在詩上取得的快活代替了譏誚與滑稽。</p>
<p>一八四二年之後，曾大發過一次痼疾，使詩人的兩手兩足甚至眼臉也侵蝕到而麻木了。半生不遂的詩人的晚年生涯於是益感慘淡了。但正由於疾病，給了他更多的時間去空想，最後還寫成一首叙事長詩。在病床上經過了八年的長久熬煎，終於在一八五六年二月十七日的早晨，結束了這個「敗殘的」人生。</p>
<h3 id="c172">樹和鷹 <a href="#c172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>— 陳棘</p>
<p>一枝年輕的柏樹，挺着廣闊的胸膛，站在無邊的莽莽草原中，搖着上身終日自由地笑，縱情地唱。他看到的只是幸福的藍天，幸福的白雲。</p>
<p>有一個傍晚，紫色的暮靄單上草原，太陽脫落他憔悴的黃髮；柚樹枝叢裏泛上一片陰暗，年輕的歌人感到了憂鬱。這時一隻大鷹飛來，拍拍大翼歇足在柚樹的枝叢農，胸口還滴落着鮮紅的血。天黑了，鷹在凄凉的夜風中悲哭。</p>
<p>「喂，世上難道有什麼使你心傷？」</p>
<p>「世上，哦朋友，流浪人在世上有太多的憂愁，殘酷的人們有太多的陰謀。他們嫉忌我自由飛翔，暗地裏，他們對準我開槍……」</p>
<p>「人們難道不愛自由和幸福？」</p>
<p>「哦朋友，人們是要戕殺自由和幸福！……</p>
<p>第二天早上，柚樹抬頭要向朝陽歌唱，只是太陽沒有出來，天空全是烏雲蒼蒼。大　像一塊石頭從樹上跌下，仰天睡倒在柚樹的脚旁。從此，大鷹閉上光亮的眼，不再高飛，袖樹也低了頭，啞掉歌喉。</p>
<p>又是傍晚，一個胖胖的城裏商人走來，叫二個人鋸斷年輕的柚樹。在自己驚惶的叫嘯裏，柚樹折斷了上身，倒下在草原上。於是工人抬了樹拾了鷹，拿到城裏去出賣。而草原空空，失去了年輕的歌人！</p>
<p>日子去了，季節流轉，雨雪不斷洗淋着草原，再也不留樹的木屑，鷹的血跡！</p>
<p>等柚樹的根部又再生長出枝梗，年代又嶄新的換過啦！</p>

<p>— 葉勁風35</p>
<p>這北平的特工首腦，看樣子相當精明，無奈湊巧他這時碰到一個糟心的問題，正在那裏團團轉，無法辦理，弄得五神無主，他應付我的作風，和那位「猪玀」副隊長的方式，竟是大同小異，儘量供奉了些上等的烟酒食品。</p>
<p>「閣下的出巡，據本職的猜測，大概不外乎一三一聯第三隊副隊長的間題？」他帶着幾分酒意，很狡猾的想討討我的口氣。他用「閣下」兩字，由於我所揑造的身份與他相等。</p>
<p>誰是一三一聯第三隊的副隊長？您大概還記得被小老虎用技擊手法，把喉管拉出，因而喪却殘生的那位「猪玀」。事情只隔了二十餘小時，當時的那一幕劇情，當然還在我記憶中活躍着。可是猛然被他當面一提，倒是叫我吃了一驚。</p>
<p>「什麽一回事？」我裝出有些醉意，又好像明知故問的樣子。</p>
<p>「這件事、是總部分撥下來的，閣下從總部來，還有不明白的嗎？…大概是看不起鄙人，因爲職位很平常，所以竟不肯推心置腹了。」他裝出一副親密而又十分脅肩詔笑的樣子。</p>
<p>「事情呢，發生在貴區這邊，兄弟是從奉天出伐的，最快的行程，也得一二天，兄弟的消息，恐怕沒有這麽快吧！」我仍舊含糊着，可是很注意觀察他的神色。</p>
<p>「雖說從奉天來很慢，難道不能乘坐飛機？再說，憑鄙人的眼光，可以斷定閣下必是從天津來，想必總部一定有電報轉達閣下，這還是猜測的一方面，實地方面，閣下的蒞臨，早有敝區的小情報通知了。」他說着還打了一個假哈哈，又恐怕太放肆，這假哈哈祗打了一半，立即停止，連連吿罪。</p>
<p>「事情是得到一些傳聞，」我因他一口咬定我是總部派來，調査這件案子的專員，裝出正顏厲色的樣子：「還得閣下，把全案的首尾再說明一些，兄弟也好再定行止，因爲事情傳到總部去了，總是有些麻煩，而且又是閣下的職責呢！」我趁機會嚇他一嚇，同時打定了主義，要利用一下機會。</p>
<p>「關於案件，鄙人在今天早晨，已經得到一〇六師團行軍司令的訓令，說一三一聯第三隊有副隊長淸野四一名，和同隊司機一名，同時失踪。」這傢伙果然吃了一嚇，立刻收起了笑容。「鄙人立刻親自跑到第三隊駐在地去調査。根據第三隊的幾個當塲人報吿的綫索，又連同一三一聯的軍部情報員一名，一路尋踪追索、首先得到了失踪的自働車一部，然後又發現了兩個淹在水中的尸體，就是失踪人的正身。」</p>
<p>「那不是謀殺嗎？」我故意揣測一句，要看他是想糢糊影響地把事情隨意了結，還是想弄個水落石出。「可有傷痕——譬如刀傷槍傷之　？」</p>
<p>「很像謀殺事件。傷痕……是……」他眼珠轉了一轉，又楞了一楞，「因爲屍體泡腫了……」</p>
<p>「謀殺必有主兇，那麼誰是主兇呢？」我知道他沒有注意傷痕，便急於要曉得他們對於我和小老虎的關係。</p>
<p>「難題就在這一點，據說那副隊長是奉命護送二位總部派遣　大員，上北平來辦理要公的；其中一位是滿洲的特工，只有二十歲的一位靑年。」</p>
<p>「也許這二人就是主兇？」我又故意逼緊一步。</p>
<p>「事實上恐怕不可能，因爲那位副隊長在他本部下手和兵士面前，說得很淸楚；他說那是兩位貴賓，一位是總部特派員，還是他的同學舊交……」</p>
<p>「那麽，這兩位貴賓的屍體……哦，他們的踪跡尋到沒有？」</p>

<p>清查團分赴各地工作以來，幾乎沒有一個地方不查出毛病來，我們連天　到這些層出不窮的舞弊新聞，難過之外，還感覺到氣悶，這一現象，將得到一個什麼結論呢，不言而喻；實在危險萬分！</p>
<p>有人將清查團認為是清茶團，是淡淡的，認為是不過聊助談興而已，雖然各地清查團都很公正地認真工作，比如劉文島先生有拍到老虎的勇氣，錢公來先生有接收眼淚的決心，但實在也查不勝查，而且牽涉也太多。限期一到，於是移交××繼續辦理完事。</p>
<p>仔細研究，截到現在止，各地清查工作主要受阻礙的一件事，就是「沒有原始清冊」，原始肖冊沒有，怎能查出接收是否符合呢？可是據我們所知道的，無論敵偽機關團體工廠學校，當時沒有一個沒有原始清冊的，尤其是日本人，他們知道將來賠償問題，這筆移交的物資，是會撥抵賠償的，所以他們決不肯馬虎一分和毫；至於偽組織，理是膽戰心驚，他們並且還希冀因保管之功而赦免，一絲一縷都是弄得清清楚楚，在這一情形之下倘使沒有原始清冊，我們敢斷定其中必有疑　，因之，清查團可以賣成交出的，而不能輕描淡寫用這個理由就搪塞過去。</p>

<p>— 楊永彰</p>
<p>一只老鼠，縱然不死在貓的爪下，它的壽命也僅三四年而已，如果你能證明世界上有某一只老鼠，它確實已經活了十年的話，那麼你立刻會被許多研究生命問題的科學家所包圍。十歲的老鼠被認為長壽是決無疑問的；但如果放在小棺材裏面的死人巧好也是十歲，除了瘋子以外，誰也不會說他是長壽的這裏暗示著我們，長壽不單指年歲之長短，因為這和動物的種族有莫大的關係。人和鼠的標準固然不同，人和人也不致，丟開別的不談，據說，黃種人的壽命比較短，日本的統計每千人中只有一百五十名左右，他們能享七十歲的壽命，但保加利亞，芬蘭，挪威等國，確實有不少長壽的人。這和地理的條件（如氣候溫度）有相當關係；同時他們都很注重個人衛生。身體方面的攝生當然能影響壽命，他如心理上的變化個人的人生觀及生活方式都和壽命有關。</p>
<p>除了個人的種種條件以外，遺傳也很重要，「有其父必有其子」，Burgen地方有一位一百六十歲的壽翁，他的兒子竟已一百〇三歲，美國某地的庭上，為了要解決一件訴訟就傳詢證人，他帶了二個兒子同來大的一百〇二歲，小的也已一百足歲，他自已的年齡是不言而喻了，維也納養老院內，醫生調查七百名年已八十歲的老人，得悉這些老人的雙親也半是七十歲以上的。現在我告訴你如果你的爸爸能夠活到九十歲的話，你也許（不一定）將來也是一位壽翁。</p>
<p>在病人死亡的證明單上醫生所寫的都是那些可怕的病名，但醫學家都熱烈希望有那麼一天：不但醫學能治療疾病，且能更進步去預防疾病，因為疾病往往破壞人的生命，使人不能長壽，醫生雖然不能創造生命，但如果人不被疾病攻擊，長壽是可以不勞而獲的。</p>
<p>細菌學家Metchmikoff以為人體大腸內的細菌是「短命」的主因。你也許要想方法殺盡腸內的細菌，以確保長壽，其實這是根本不可能的。大腸內的細菌是消化機能上不可或缺的媒介，而且也沒有法子可以除去細菌，但至少胃腸的保健可以使人獲得健康，吃素食的人所以比較長壽，就是因為腸內不易起發酵現象（肉類較蔬菜為甚）。</p>
<p>營養也能影響長壽，一個營養不足的人，你想他會長壽的嗎？</p>
<p>有人主張腦子的重量和壽命也有關系，愈重愈長壽，不過到現在還不能證明。</p>
<p>長壽，長壽，人都希望長壽，其實我倒以為太長壽反而失去生活的緊張性和趣味性，你想如果人人都能生活上一千歲，這個世界恐怕還要弄得糟了。</p>
<p>我不求長壽，只希望在短短的年月中，努力創造自已的充實的人生。</p>

<p>— 文宗孔</p>
<p>文人抄襲，古時早有發現，不過大都屬於詩家，他們偶然在前人的詩詞中，擷取一二佳句，藉使自己的作品，可以生色，目的是盜些聲名而已，倒並無利的念頭。像何遜詩「薄雲　際出，初月渡中上」杜甫換去四個字，「薄雲嚴際宿，孤月浪中翻。」便成為杜詩了。又像林　把江為詩「竹影橫斜水清淺，桂香浮動月黃昏。」換「竹」為「疎」，易「桂」作「暗」，也就變成他的詠梅詩了。</p>
<p>但是到了今日，抄襲之風，蔚然昌盛，且有公開與走私之分，前者像市上所出版的「文摘」刊物，他們不外有兩種宗旨；（一）因為大好文章，讀者不容易全部看到，所以他們就實行博搜選摘，蒐集著刊載起來，以便讀者的閱覽便利。（二）因為這樣一來，對於他們稿費的支出，未嘗不可以節省。</p>
<p>往往有一般墮落的文人，為了生活的威協，感覺一般報紙和雜志，又難於使自已不夠水準的文章，被編者錄取刊登，於是不得不冒著危險，動了卑劣的腦筯。翻翻數年前他處已經刊載的較好文章，或是一些偏僻雜誌上的幽默翻譯，將它改頭換面一下，抄好了向報館裏一送，這樣的稿件，自然容易發表，那末他也就可以靜候稿費了。</p>
<p>但是處於園丁地位的編者，雖然對於自已的園地十分珍視，不過單憑著他僅有的一些限力與時間，決不易縝密地辦別各處農場寄來繁雜的種籽，因此待到遊客的光臨，才會給他們指摘出。這是不值栽培的　草，那是已經變種的花兒！</p>
<p>本月十日自由談的園地裏，居然被一位懷伊子先生，也在遊園的時候，發現了八月一日所載署名為「淩捉煙」投稿的「聰明與傻瓜」一文，竟是抄襲三十三年六月十二日出版之「潮流」叢刊第一二四頁丹心先生所作之「聰明人與傻瓜」。我覺得此公非常膽大，不過有趣的是被揭發的文章，卻恰巧題目為「聰明與傻瓜」，是不是文曲星在冥冥之中玩弄文抄公，說他聰明人反變為傻瓜呢？</p>
<p>看了「編輯室」的揭發抄襲所載，那位抄襲者也夠慘了，在這樣的情形下，我們還要「罔談彼短」的戳壁腳，似乎有傷忠厚，但是顧念到這塊珍貴的寸金之地，為保護嘉禾的滋長，與體恤園丁的精力，我們遊園的一群，就不能不咬緊牙根，放出尖銳的眼光，協助編者，來拔除那魚目混珠的稗草，使將來能得到優良的收獲！</p>

<h3 id="c180">羊毛出在誰身上 <a href="#c180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>— 范正邦</p>
<p>吳市長說兩年後收買跑馬廳羊毛出在身上，似乎即以跑馬廳收來之款收買跑馬廳，合算之至。其實出羊毛的羊是誰，不是十九為中國百姓嗎？外國人允許送給市府的羊毛不是出在中國羊的身上嗎，而同時外國人卻收去了更多的羊毛。此語自外國人　來方為確當，吳市長的算盤反被外國商人打了去哩。我們旁觀者清，此乃吳市長之政聲之關鍵，如果我是吳市長的智囊，我要勸吳市長隨參議會去議決，乃屬上策。如果加以說項，斯為下策。若能加以反對，斯乃最上上策。若雲兩年後收買誰又能擔保？去年底前五千元法幣可買一擔上好白米，此刻買不到一鬥好米。要買不如現在集合投資或中外合辦有利事業，於此偌大基地上。我想爽脆回絕於其既跑而拿其錢之後再禁其不跑耶？</p>
<p>兩點意見：第一，羊毛出在誰身上？第二，兩年之後的事，誰能保證？親愛的市長，尊從人民的意見吧！人民會擁戴你的！</p>

<p>— 菖蒲</p>
<p>日昨友人張君來訪，因為二人都是教育界中人，所以話題不離本行，隨後談到教員的進退問題上去。他告訴我一椿令人發指的事情，使我不得不把它記錄下來。讓讀者知道世界上還有這種令人啼笑皆非的事。</p>
<p>事情是這樣的：八月廿五日張君看到報載滬東某小學擬聘請男女教員數位的啟事，他就將履歷寄去，二天之後接到一信，叫他在廿九日上午赴大西路某某小學面洽試教事宜，他以為事情必是稍有希望了，豈知該日上午親往該校時，原來是一個簡陋的衛堂小學，僅僅六七十個學生，校長兼打鐘的校役，學生抬風琴，泡開水，兼做雜差。那位校長先生神氣十足，擺出似理不理的態度，當時使張君已經起了孤疑，後來叫他當日擔任了好幾個鐘點的課程，沒有水喝，弄得精疲力盡，口幹舌燥，才讓他回去，臨時說過不論聘請與否，隔日必給他回信，可是張君回家後等了五六天，竟毫音訊。知道已經上了當，自已費了事資，又在大熱天替他教書，「賠了夫人又折兵」了。原來那個精明的校長恐怕開學遲了學生會拉不住，所以提早開課；但又不願老教員自八月起薪，所以想出這種法子來。說得好聽些是請新教員試教，實際上卻是替他自已省去八月份薪津的支出。</p>
<p>凡此種種，真令人無話可說。</p>

<h3 id="c182">閩臺清查團長劉文島　臺灣打虎去 <a href="#c182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>— 君默</p>
<p>閩臺接收工作清查團團長劉文島到了臺灣，十二日招待記者，說：「我們此次來臺，是要打老虎，不是拍蒼蠅。」</p>
<p>見過劉文島的人，都可以相信他是能打幾下老虎的：高高的身材，結實的個子，方頭大耳，雖然似乎常常掛著張笑葉嘻嘻的臉孔，但不大說話，使人難以猜出他會要想做點什麼？</p>
<p>軍人出身</p>
<p>這是一位軍人出身的政治家，他半生的事業，一半化在自已的故鄉湖北，劉文島和漢口市的關係是特別悠長；另一半則化在國外—德國和意大利。他在保定軍校畢業以後，也和許多同班同學們一樣，到了日本，但他對於帶兵似乎一直是興趣很少，所以不久便去了法國，在巴黎大學學法律。回國的時候，正值北伐的大業展開；他，一個學過軍事而後轉到了法律路上的三十四幾的年青人，便擔任了國民革命軍前敵總指揮部的政治部主任。北伐軍占領了漢口，他便出任了這南北樞紐之城的市長。那時候，久被軍閥盤據的漢口，一切都還是亂糟糟，尤其又因為漢口的有特區和法日租界，治理上更多困難，就以交通這件事來說，那時漢口的人力車不能拉進特區和租界，特區和租界的人力車也不能夠拉出來。這件事情使交通上發生極多困難，經過了劉氏多次和租界當局的交涉，才算兩邊的「通軍」成功。但想不到這一段小小的「國際交涉」，卻正是他以後一長段的外交事業的開始。</p>
<p>一度使德</p>
<p>二十年，劉氏出任駐德公使；以後，又轉任駐義大利公使。戰前的幾年，中國和義大利間的關係，相當良好，尤其是航空方面，在飛機及飛行的訓練上，合作很多，當時杭州　橋的中央航空學校，大部分的外籍教官都是義大處人。劉氏在航空合作方面所作的工作，貢獻很大。但是二十六年，八一三戰起，這批忘恩負義的義大利教官卻坐在日本轟炸機裏，把杭州的火軍站炸成了個空殼，這又豈是劉氏當初所能料及呢！</p>
<p>頗懂幽默</p>
<p>劉文島頗有點幽默，但不大肯留情面。在他做漢口市長的時候，那裏有一位鼎鼎大名的堪與大家，名叫做丁壽陽，在漢口也混了有二十多年了。專替人看墳地風水，據說是無不中，市政府裏有一位局長對他信服得了不得，介紹了他到市長公館去，物色一棺佳城的牛眠吉地。這位風水先生在劉文島前面吹得個天花亂墜，說是看了這麼一塊墳地，必可以榮華富貴，萬世其昌。劉一聲不響，等他說完了，過了好半天，才慢吞吞地問道：「既然是這樣，那你可不先替自已看一塊呢？」把這位澆了一頭冷水的堪與大家，趕出了大門。</p>
<p>這自然只是拍了一只蒼蠅，但劉氏這次是自已去看看臺灣的風水了，想必可以扳一扳同樣的冷面孔，打它幾頭老虎回來吧！</p>

<h3 id="e1">Important Consultations Held in Beiping; Chen Cheng and Du Yuming Arrive in Shenyang; Communist Army to Launch Offensive in Liaoning Province <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Chen Cheng, Du Yuming</p>
<p>[Report from our Beiping office, 16th] Chen Cheng and Du Yuming flew to Shenyang from Beiping at 2:00 PM today. It is reported that Chen's visit to the north was to discuss with Li Zongren and others matters such as military reorganization, defense deployment, and is also said to be related to the restoration of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway traffic. Last night, Chen invited Li Zongren, Sun Lianzhong, Chen Jicheng, Wang Hongshao (Chief of Staff of the Provisional Headquarters), Song Yuntang, and Li Wen, Chief of Intelligence of the Commander-in-Chief's Office, to a military meeting, which lasted until after 1:00 AM. After 9:00 AM this morning, more than 30 leading figures from the party, government, and military of Beiping and Tianjin, including Li Zongren, Sun Lianzhong, Chen Jicheng, Xiong Bin, Zhang Boying, Mou Tingfang, and Hu Bohan, visited Chen at the Diplomatic Building. Du Yuming also accompanied them, bringing many others. In the spacious living room, they conducted a broad and informal review of various issues in North China. In addition, Chen had separate talks with Feng Qinzai, Chairman of Chahar Province, Zheng Jiemin, member of the Executive Headquarters, and Xu Kangliang, Commander of the Beiping Air Force District. Chen took a trip to the Summer Palace yesterday amidst his busy schedule and also visited Hu Shi and Fu Sinian. It is reported that Chen flew from Gu to Zheng on the 8th and inspected the areas around Kaifeng, Lanfeng, and Xinxiang. He only flew to Beiping yesterday with Du Yuming and Gao Guizi.</p>
<p>[Report from our Beiping office, 16th] Du Yuming accompanied Chen Cheng to Shenyang by plane today. Before his departure, he told our reporter that there would not be large-scale military conflicts in the Northeast recently, but if the Communist army attacked, the National army would resolutely counterattack at any time. This trip to Gu was to report the situation in the Northeast to the Chairman. When the reporter asked what instructions the Chairman had for the Northeast, Du replied that the Chairman instructed the Northeast to pay attention to restoring order and stabilizing people's livelihood. Du's face was much fuller than when he was recuperating in Beiping. He left Gu and flew to Zhengzhou on the 14th and arrived in Beiping yesterday on the same plane as Chen Cheng.</p>
<p>[Report from our Beiping office, 16th] If the Communist army does not lift the siege of Datong, will the National army attack Zhangjiakou? Chief of Staff Chen Cheng answered this question very cleverly. He said: "You can study and research it. If the Communist army does not lift the siege, is it better for the government forces to clear the Tongpu Road or attack Zhangjiakou?" The reporter pressed: "Didn't the Chief of Staff once say that Datong and Zhangjiakou are on the same battlefield?" Chen replied: "I said it, but it's a common practice in military strategy to make the real seem unreal and the unreal seem real." When asked about his mission to the Northeast, he cautiously said that he had not yet decided to go. Three hours later, he and General Du Yuming flew to Shenyang. Today, reporters from this newspaper and Ta Kung Pao only had a three-minute conversation with General Chen. It was when he was walking and talking as he got out of the building and into the car. Chen looked rosy, and his stomach ailment seemed to have healed, but his hair was even whiter than silver.</p>
<p>[Report from our Shenyang office, 16th] Chief of Staff Chen Cheng, accompanied by Chief Du Yuming, arrived at Beiling Airport at 4:30 PM on the 16th. Director Xiong and others went to welcome him. Those who came with Chief of Staff Chen included Xu Langxuan, Chief of the First Division of the Third Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense, and Gao Dechang, Chief of the Third Section of the same division. Chen told our reporter: "This is my first time in the Northeast. After arriving in Shenyang, I saw that many places in Shenyang were destroyed, but Shenyang is still our Shenyang. Everyone should work hard to build this land. This trip is to see the situation in the Northeast. I haven't decided where to go from here yet." Chen looked energetic and very happy. Chief Du flew to Gu on the 12th and returned on the 16th. According to what he told the reporter: "This time, I went to see the Chairman to report on the recovery of Chengde and the suffering of the people. The Chairman is very concerned about the Northeast, especially hoping to restore order and stabilize people's livelihood." He accompanied Chief of Staff Chen to Zhengzhou on the 14th for inspection.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Beiping, 16th] According to sources from the Communist side, the Northeast government forces divided into three routes yesterday and began to attack Harbin. The battle is currently taking place near Taolaizhao on the north bank of the Songhua River. Du Yuming, Commander of the Northeast Security, has returned to his defense post after seeking instructions from Chairman Chiang in Lushan. Du will directly command the military operations to attack Harbin.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 15th] According to reports: the 33rd Regiment of the 11th Brigade of the Communist army and the 3rd Regiment of the Independent Division, attached with two mountain guns and rapid-fire guns each, launched a fierce attack on the National army stationed at Xin Kai Ling, ten kilometers southeast of Dashiqiao, at 5:00 PM on the 13th. As of 8:00 AM on the 14th, the battle was still ongoing. Based on the overall situation in recent days, it seems that the Communist army will launch a large-scale offensive in the north and south of Liaoning Province.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Communist Forces in Jining Completely Eliminated; National Army Vanguard Reaches Sumu; Datong Garrison Launches Attack to Recover Strongholds <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 16th] Starting on the morning of the 16th, the Datong National army launched attacks in multiple directions. As of 11:00 AM, they had recovered eight strongholds, including the Police Academy west of the city, Wulidian, Majunying, Zhujiazhuang, and the airport south of the city, Shuiquanwan, Beiyue Temple, and Zhoujiadian. On the east side of the city, the National army had crossed the Yu River and were advancing towards Qijiadian, Caifulou, and Shaling.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 16th] More than 600 Communist troops in the Qilicun, Beiyue Temple, and Zhoujiadian areas south of Datong launched another attack on Nanguan and Wayao Lin around 10:00 PM on the 14th. After fierce fighting, they were repelled in the afternoon and are currently confronting the National army at a distance of 100 meters. On the same day, a unit of the Communist army, fifty kilometers south of Wulidian west of the city, infiltrated under the cover of mountain guns, but were suppressed by artillery fire from the city wall and fled back after suffering losses.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Gui Sui, 15th] The National army rescuing Datong continued to advance after recovering Jining. The vanguard has reached Sumu (one station away from Jining). There are currently no traces of the Communist army within thirty miles around Jining.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 16th] The people in the two counties of Hequ and Pianguan in northwestern Shanxi suffered unspeakable hardships under the occupation of the Communist army. Wei Zhuwuying, fearing the people of Hequ County, led the security team to recover Pianguan City on the 12th, dividing his troops to capture Guanhekou in the north and Louziying in the south. On the 13th, they continued to capture Hequ County, and are now advancing towards the Xunzheng area. The people of the two counties are overjoyed to see the light of day again.</p>
<p>[Report from our Beiping office, 16th] Yesterday's air force reconnaissance report stated that there were no traces of the Communist army within fifty li around Jining. The Communist army in Jining adopted a centrifugal strategy, retreating in all directions. One branch retreating towards the northeast was bombed by the air force en route, suffering half casualties. It is reported that the Communist army suffered more than 20,000 casualties in the Jining campaign, most of whom were killed after arriving at the periphery to reinforce Jining. The coordination between the National army's land and air forces was extremely thorough.</p>
<p>[Report from our Gui Sui office, 15th] The National army cavalry yesterday pursued and attacked the defeated Communist forces of E Yousan and Liu Chunfang, which had fled from Jining. At Honghaizi, forty li east of the city, they annihilated most of the 358th Brigade, killing 400, capturing 200 alive, and seizing 900 rifles, 20 light and heavy machine guns, and several mountain guns. The Communist army was surrounded by the cavalry. Many had blood coming from their mouths and noses, and they kowtowed to beg for mercy. Also, merchants from Beiping to Sui said that they saw the National army of the 11th War Area arrive in Xiahuayuan when they passed through, and they were advancing westward towards Zhangyuan.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Gui Sui, 16th] The eastern section of the Ping Sui Railway is being actively repaired. In addition to the fact that passenger trains have already resumed service from Gui Sui to Fusheng Zhuang, because the Communist army was defeated in both the Zhuozishan and Jining campaigns and did not have time to damage the tracks, repairs are relatively easy. It is estimated that the railway will be open to traffic in about five more days. However, the water towers and bridges that were originally damaged are difficult to repair due to the huge engineering work involved. Only temporary pontoon bridges are being built, and water tankers are carried with the trains to supply water along the way.</p>
<h3 id="e3">National Army in Eastern Hebei Recovers Pinggu <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>[Report from our Beiping office, 16th] A general who came to Beiping from Tianjin this morning said that the National army has recovered Pinggu, the last county town in eastern Hebei occupied by the Communist army. The National army is currently conducting cautious mopping-up operations in the eastern Hebei plains covered by the green gauze curtains.</p>
<p>[Report from our Tianjin office, 16th] In the battles around Baoding, the Communist army is driving innocent civilians as the vanguard. For days, the Communist army has been attacking the National army at night, all driving civilians to form the vanguard, each holding hand grenades to charge and kill. After inspecting the corpses outside the trenches on the 15th and discovering the above situation, the National army has decided to use infiltration tactics to disintegrate the Communist army from behind in order to reduce the death rate in the war.</p>
<h3 id="e4">National Army Going North Points Directly at Huai'an and Huaibei; Communist Forces in Northern Jiangsu Show Signs of Wavering; Moving Towards Huai'an and Bao'ying to Save the Critical Situation <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>[Report from our Taixian office, 16th] In the northern battlefront of northern Jiangsu, due to the National army pointing directly at Huai'an and Huaibei, the Communist army has shown signs of wavering. The Communist forces in the areas of Dongtai, Xinghua, and Yancheng are moving towards the area between Huai'an and Bao'ying in an attempt to save the critical situation. The Communist army in Shaobo is stepping up its defenses in view of the National army's northward advance. Also, a certain elite unit of the National army, after lifting the siege of Rugao, has now arrived in the vicinity of Hai'an and established contact with the National army originally stationed in the town. The Communist forces near Huangqiao have been moving towards Qutang and Baimi for days, their purpose being to strengthen the forces on the Qutang-Hai'an line in order to prevent the National army from advancing west.</p>
<p>[Report from our Xinpu office, 15th] The National army in northern Jiangsu has made rapid progress since recovering Suqian. The vanguard forces have now arrived at places such as Dingji and Xinji, more than twenty li southwest of Shuyang County. The Communist army's Fourth Regiment, entrenched in the territory of Shuyang County, seeing the tense situation, has experienced a mutiny in one unit. The Communist army has imposed martial law in its controlled areas starting from the 10th, prohibiting people from passing through, and conscripting young men from house to house, establishing a reserve regiment in each district in preparation for civil war.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] The Lianhai Line, the eastern section of the Longhai Railway, added automatic express trains on the 15th of this month, running four times a day in each direction.</p>
<p>[United Press, this city, 16th] According to a senior military officer of the National army in northern Jiangsu: except for a section of about fifty li along the Longhai Railway east of Xuzhou, the remaining Communist forces in northern Jiangsu and northeastern Anhui Province have almost been completely surrounded by the National army. It is rumored that in the Battle of Sixian, the 8th Division of the Communist Eighth Route Army was virtually annihilated, so those currently in contact with the National army are only the 2nd and 7th Divisions and the 9th Column of the New Fourth Army. The 8th Division is an elite force of the Communist army, and this spring it captured eight counties from the National army. Although the Communist army still occupies a section of fifty li of the Longhai Railway as a retreat, the National army officer said: "That section of land is flooded, which will make the transportation of the Communist army's troops and supplies extremely difficult, so its importance has been reduced. And since the recovery of Lingbi, Wuhu, and Sixian, the National army has broken into the western part of this rectangular encirclement, which is conducive to reducing the Communist forces."</p>
<p>National Army Recovers Many Strongholds</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 16th] Huaiyin is the main stronghold of the Communist army, and they often harass the National army. The National army there was forced to counterattack, and at 10:00 AM on the 15th, they recovered Chenjiaji (13 kilometers southwest of Huaiyin), Dabao (3 kilometers north of Chenjiaji), and Wangjia Taoyuan (9 kilometers southwest of Huaiyin). They then continued to counterattack Xiaoyuezhen (3 kilometers southeast of Chenjiaji), Matouzhen (7 kilometers southwest of Huaiyin), and Yangzhuangzhen (5 kilometers west of Huaiyin). The Communist army resisted stubbornly and counterattacked the National army at Matouzhen six times, but was finally repelled. By 4:00 PM, all of the above strongholds had been completely recovered by the National army. In this battle, about a thousand Communist soldiers were captured.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 16th] (1) The National army that recovered Siyang crossed the Grand Canal on the 14th and recovered Zhongxingji. The Communist army fled towards Shuyang. (2) The 9th Column of the Communist army, which had intruded into the Southern Xinjie (about 15 kilometers south of Siyang), was defeated by the National army on the 14th, and the area was recovered. The remaining Communist troops fled west towards Huaiyin.</p>
<h3 id="e5">National Army in Western Shandong Recovers Jining <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Jinan, 16th] The National army recovered Jining on the morning of the 15th, which is the first city in western Shandong (west of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway).</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 16th] The Communist army's 9th Column in Jining, Shandong, suddenly attacked the National army on the 15th. The National army immediately counterattacked, and the Communist army was defeated and routed. The National army took the opportunity to recover Jining City. More than 600 Communist soldiers surrendered and handed over more than 1,000 rifles.</p>
<h3 id="e6">Bumper Autumn Harvest, Grain Prices Fall Universally; Economic Situation Bound to Change; Xu Kan Talks to Our Reporter <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>[Report from our Nanjing office, 16th] Minister Xu of the Ministry of Food met with our reporter at 5:00 PM on the 16th and made the following statement: "This year's autumn harvest has been bountiful in most parts of the country, and grain prices have fallen universally. However, because (1) the damage suffered by rural areas during the long eight-year war of resistance was extremely great, and has not yet returned to its original state in the short term; (2) in the disaster-stricken areas last year, due to the severe lack of manpower, animal power, fertilizer, and seeds, cultivation was not widespread; (3) in some areas with particularly abundant grain production, grain is currently being blockaded or destroyed, and transportation is also being destroyed or obstructed, making it difficult for the flow of grain to return to a state of equilibrium between surplus and deficiency; (4) before the war, the average amount of grain imported overseas each year was about 1.6 million tons, even in years of good harvest, it was around 1 million tons. Based on the above four points, with regard to the future grain situation, we sincerely hope that domestic transportation can be restored quickly so that areas with surplus or deficiency can be adjusted accordingly. We also hope that rice, wheat, and flour from abroad can be transported in as scheduled to enrich the people's food supply. In the coming months, it will be a season of falling grain prices, and grain prices in various places will continue to fall. We sincerely hope that wages and general prices can fall equally, then the economic situation will be greatly improved."</p>

<p>[Report from our Nanjing office, 16th] Since the Communist Party issued a general mobilization broadcast from Yan'an, there have been active movements in various counties in northern Shaanxi, and a cadre meeting was held to discuss the issue of internal unrest. The central tasks determined for the present are as follows: (1) war first, production second; (2) expand the conscription of young men; (3) strengthen "suppression of traitors," strictly check pedestrians, and eliminate "villains"; (4) crack down on war-resistant elements and enhance the belief in the inevitable victory of the civil war; (5) strengthen wartime organizations, such as stretcher teams, transportation teams, guerrilla teams, and small groups; (6) strengthen wartime education, such as propaganda and clearing the fields.</p>
<h3 id="e8">Ambassador Marshall Leaves Gu to Return to Nanjing; Wu and Zhang Visit the Ambassador to Exchange Views; Zhou Enlai Arrives in Shanghai, Return Date to Nanjing Undetermined <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>[Report from our Nanjing office, 16th] Special Envoy Marshall and his wife will leave Gu on the 17th to return to Nanjing. The political activities in the capital will be determined after Ambassador Marshall comes down the mountain. At 10:30 AM on the 16th, Wang Bingnan of the Communist delegation visited Ambassador Stuart. Wang told him that the current war situation is serious and that there is an urgent need to convene a military three-person group meeting to discuss the necessity of a truce as soon as possible. He also said: "If we proceed through the political path through an informal five-person group meeting, it will not be easy to obtain the most effective way to resolve the current critical situation." Ambassador Stuart believed that the military problem is serious, but if we do not start from the political path to achieve the goal of a truce, then the so-called "truce" is still not a long-term solution. The Ambassador still believes that convening an informal five-person group meeting is the appropriate method at present. Wang left at 12:00. At 11:00 AM, Pi Zonggan, a counselor from the Nationalist government, also visited the Ambassador. Pi told reporters that this visit was half public and half private, because Pi brought his paperwork with him. At 11:20 AM, Pi drove away himself. At 4:30 PM, Zhang Lisheng visited Ambassador Stuart, and at 5:00 PM, Wu Tiecheng also arrived, and Pi Zonggan was also present during the meeting with the Ambassador. They left successively at 6:45 PM. It is reported that the content of the conversation was that Ambassador Stuart first told about his conversation with Wang Bingnan, and then they exchanged opinions. The Ambassador seemed eager to find an appropriate way to promote this peace negotiation.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guling, 16th] Chairman Chiang and his wife and Special Envoy Marshall and his wife revisited the Five Old Peaks at 5:00 PM on the afternoon of the 16th and had a picnic there. Marshall also had his first meeting with the Chairman after climbing Guling eight times. They returned with pleasure around 6:00 PM.</p>
<p>[Report from our Nanjing office, 16th] Zhou Enlai took a special plane to Shanghai from Nanjing Airport at 2:30 PM on the afternoon of the 16th. His secretary Zhang Wenjin and Communist Party spokesman Fan Changjiang and others accompanied him. In the evening, Wang Bingnan, spokesman for the Communist Party delegation, said that Zhou's stay in Shanghai was indefinite, and he would only return when the military three-person group meeting had a definite date to convene, which is also sufficient to show the Communist Party's stubborn attitude. Also, Zhou's trip will use the "masses'" order to suspend publication as a matter to negotiate with various parties.</p>
<h3 id="e9">Communist Army Uses Negotiations as an Excuse to Seek a Chance to Breathe <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 16th] The New York Times, according to what the American reporter stationed in Nanjing said, the Communist Party, in view of the recent military victories of the National army, wants to use Marshall to achieve a truce agreement, and said that there are signs that China has obtained a temporary peace. However, the newspaper expressed deep fear that this may be a Communist trick to gain a chance to breathe, thereby restoring its political war. Yan'an is good at political warfare, and propaganda and obstruction are its most important weapons. Yan'an, in addition to using guerrilla tactics, is not prepared to meet the National army on the battlefield. After the National army achieved a surprising victory in the Northeast last time, Yan'an showed a clear tendency to negotiate, which seems to happen again. But even if any concrete results can be produced, or it is only a tactical concession. Past experience tells us that this is just a Communist trick. The newspaper said: "The advancement of national policy has not launched a full-scale offensive against Yan'an, its purpose is only to 'force the Communist Party to withdraw from the many occupied lands it seized after the Japanese army surrendered, so as to end the economic paralysis caused by this occupation.'"</p>

<h3 id="e14">Traitors Zhou Fohai, Ding Mocun, and Others; Five Major Traitors Escorted to Nanjing Yesterday; Each Person Looked Discouraged, With Regret of "Thinking of Those Years" <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>[Report from our Nanjing office, 16th] The five major traitors, including Zhou Fohai and Ding Mocun, who are considered to have "special characteristics" by all parties, were flown from Chongqing and escorted to Nanjing at 4:45 PM on the 16th. Because the news was confidential, very few people knew about it in advance. Our reporter waited at the airport for two hours before seeing China National Aviation Corporation passenger plane No. 38 descending. The personnel responsible for the escort first deployed guards on the field. After the cabin door was opened, two small buses and two large trucks specially prepared by the Bureau of Investigation and Statistics drove up. Ding Mocun first stood at the cabin door, looking gloomy, wearing a gray gabardine long gown, white silk trousers, gray cotton black shoes, with a sallow complexion. Then Zhou Fohai also appeared. He was taller than Ding Mocun. According to observers on the field, he was much thinner than in the era of the puppet government, and his demeanor was also greatly discouraged, seeming to imply "I have also seen your end." Zhou was wearing a gray cloth long gown, white trousers, light red short socks, and black shoes. When getting off the plane, Ding was in front, and Zhou was second. Zhou entered the car box at a rapid pace. Next was Luo Junqiang, wearing a blue-gray gauze short gown and trousers, holding a raincoat. The three traitors rode in the same car. Then there were Ma, Yang (names unknown), and a maid riding in another car. There were also several men and women following, their facial expressions were very nervous, presumably they were their family members and followers. It is learned that they talked from time to time in the plane, their mood was discouraged, especially Zhou seemed to be unable to overcome the feelings of today and past, the luxury of when he invested in "Wang's regime" in the past and being a prisoner in Nanjing again. After getting off the plane, they were taken directly to the detention center at No. 19 Ninghai Road. Our reporter went to explore their life in the thunderstorm in the evening, but did not get to enter for a visit, but saw that the interior was a Western-style residence, with bright electric lights and open glass windows. The light and air were much better than the residences of the petty bourgeoisie. According to inquiries, Zhou and Luo lived in the same room, with two beds and a table in the room. Ding, Ma, Yang and their adjutant lived in one room, and the nurse and maid lived in one room. No one has visited after entering the prison. The guarding police officers all smiled and told that Zhou and others were very silent and did not say much, but their uneasy demeanor showed the regret of "thinking of those years" and "a single wrong step." It is also heard that Zhou and others will soon be transferred to the Capital High Court for trial.</p>

<p>[Our newspaper, Suzhou, 16th] Minister of Justice Xie, at 10:00 AM on the 16th, attended the joint weekly memorial service of the High Court and District Court, and addressed the assembled three hundred prosecutors and judges. He said: Reconstruction work, especially the judiciary, is the most important area, because the punishment of traitors and the resolution of civil and criminal disputes are all related to the national principles and social justice. The units below the Jiangsu High Court have achieved considerable results in the past year, but they are not yet perfect and require continued efforts from everyone. He also hoped that they would strive to implement the three words "New," "Fast," and "Practical" as demonstrated in the Chairman's speech, so that changing customs and turning weakness into strength would not be difficult to achieve. As for his explanation: "New" means adapting to the times, constantly striving for self-improvement, innovating daily, and evolving with the times. "Fast" means taking the psychology of the parties involved in litigation as your own, empathizing with others, and handling cases quickly. "Practical" means taking responsibility for judging cases, being down-to-earth, and handling cases impartially. He hoped that everyone would eliminate long-standing malpractices and strive to act diligently in all three areas. Xie continued to encourage his colleagues to take on responsibilities and endure hardships, and to bring glory to the entire judicial system. The weekly meeting ended at 12:00 PM. He then went to the Lion Grove for lunch and visited famous gardens such as Humble Administrator's Garden.

<p>(II) Here, we must also express our frank and sincere opinions on the current party issues in the country.</p>
<p>We believe that the ideal of communism and the Principle of People's Livelihood in the Three Principles of the People, which we believe in, differ only in philosophical foundation and implementation methods. However, the goal of transforming this economically deformed society into an economically equal and common society is the same. However, it is universally recognized by all Chinese and foreign people that Marxism, which originated in Western societies where capitalism has become deeply rooted after the Industrial Revolution, cannot be overly applied to China, which is lagging behind in industrial development. As for the discrepancy between the words and deeds of the Chinese Communist Party, it is even more obvious. The Communist Party used to call for resistance against Japan, but in reality, it used the opportunity of resistance to develop its power; it shouted for unity, but in reality, it attempted to divide the territory and undermine the unity of our country; today, it shouts for democracy, but in reality, it practices class dictatorship in the liberated areas it has opened up. From the advancement in the south and the invasion of the Northeast to the attack on Datong, it has never stopped its ambition to seize territory and attack cities, and its reckless actions that harm the country and the people. We really do not understand what their intentions are. What we especially and absolutely oppose is the Chinese Communist Party teaching people not to love their country and teaching people to diminish humanity. It is clear that the Communist Party disregards the interests of the country, does not hesitate to undermine our country's international status, and eliminates our nation's self-esteem. The inherent morality of the Chinese nation lies in loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, love, trustworthiness, righteousness, and peace. The reason why China was able to resist the aggression of Japan and obtain the final victory was not due to the superiority of science or organization in a few people, but due to the potential of the various inherent moral national spirits left by our ancestors. The Chinese Communist Party does not hesitate to destroy it ruthlessly. No matter what country or nation, it is especially necessary for its citizens to have the spirit of independence and freedom in order to establish itself in today's world. The Chinese Communist Party does not hesitate to ruthlessly destroy the most valuable cultural heritage of the country and the nation. Not only are we youths of the Three Principles of the People firmly opposed to it, but even the youths of all levels of society in the country, even those who have already joined the Chinese Communist Party, may not be able to bear it.</p>
<p>What we have always expected from the Chinese Communist Party is that they will abide by their promises made in the early days of the War of Resistance to support Chairman Chiang and thoroughly realize the Three Principles of the People, promote nationalization, integrate their armed forces into the country's military, and become a legitimate political party in order to promote the implementation of constitutional government. If they can win the sympathy of the people for their socialist policies and urge the government to implement them, then we, the youth of the Three Principles of the People, who originally regard the implementation of the Principle of People's Livelihood as our great duty, do not want to oppose them. Based on our conscience and our reason, we ask the many youths of the Chinese Communist Party to consider deeply, not to be intoxicated by a few ambitious people, and even more not to be coerced by dark violence and mislead the country and themselves. Only in this way can they be considered youths of the Republic of China and be worthy of being descendants of the Yellow Emperor.</p>
<p>In addition, we would also like to state here our opinions on other parties other than the Chinese Communist Party. We believe that in accordance with the great road of the Three Principles of the People and the grand plan of the National Father's revolution for our country, when the time comes for constitutional government, any party, as long as it does not violate the Three Principles of the People and does not plot to harm the Republic of China, can obtain legitimate existence and protection. The Three Principles of the People state that the country is owned by the people and politics is shared by the people. In the political thought of this century, this glorious and immortal proposition will inevitably be protected by all enlightened people. There is absolutely no reason for a fair and just political party to oppose the fundamental proposition of the Three Principles of the People. The policies advocated by the various parties now, although there are some differences, have not been able to escape the scope of the Three Principles of the People. The Chinese Nationalist Party has a glorious history of holding the Three Principles of the People revolution to save the country for fifty years, and today it has made great contributions to the Republic of China. At a time when the Chinese Nationalist Party is leading the people of the country to resist Japanese imperialism and is about to realize constitutional government, people from all parties have a patriotic conscience. They will inevitably cherish the past hard work of the Nationalist Party and accept the sincerity of the Nationalist Party to cooperate sincerely with all parties in order to achieve the goal of peaceful nation-building. If the interests of the party are placed above the interests of the country, and the morality of the political party is placed below the strength of the political party, it is not the demeanor that a politician should have. Especially for political parties in a democratic government, they must have the spirit of independence and autonomy and the magnanimity of being open and aboveboard. They must not be considered the outer circle of the Communist Party and speak for the Communist Party in vain. If their content and spirit are manipulated by the Communist Party and cannot be autonomous, and their actions and speeches are dominated by the Communist Party and they lose their independent purpose, then it does not conform to the spirit of today's democratic politics. We, the youth of the Three Principles of the People, not only feel sorry for them, but also feel disappointed in them.</p>
<p>(III) Based on the above-mentioned domestic enthusiasm and the various domestic political parties, we want to state our belief in the Three Principles of the People and our views on the current state affairs.</p>
<p>We deeply believe that the Three Principles of the People is not only the great road to save China, but also the truth to transform the lives of all mankind. The Three Principles of the People start from humanitarianism and focus on the survival of all mankind. It explores all the spirits of freedom, equality, and fraternity, and is guided by scientific thought. The Three Principles of the People is a combination of nationalism, democracy, and the Principle of People's Livelihood. We, the followers of the Three Principles of the People, naturally oppose fascism and imperialism. We cannot agree with the doctrine of class dictatorship that originates from materialism and ignores political freedom. We believe that to save today's chaotic China, we can only adhere to the Three Principles of the People and strive to implement the Three Principles of the People. Similarly, to save today's chaotic world, we can only seek a reasonable solution to the three major problems of human economy, politics, and nation based on the principles of the Three Principles of the People. First, internationally, we advocate faithfully abiding by the United Nations Charter, uniting all countries in the world, and solving all the urgent problems that need to be solved in a permanent way. All outdated ideas that attempt to use strong military force to dominate the world, as well as those that oppose racial equality, the freedom of the people, and economic interdependence, should not be allowed to exist. China, in its current chaotic situation, should promote the consistent spirit of justice and reason of our Chinese nation, fulfill our obligations as a member of the United Nations, to promote the cooperation of friendly countries, to implement our common war goals, to prevent the revival of strong politics, that is, to permanently eliminate the recurrence of war. The Three Principles of the People is the strength we rely on, and it is the unity of 450 million people. We must resolutely strive to realize the truth.</p>
<p>Secondly, domestically, we believe that today's China has entered a new era of constitutional government. It is the eve of the completion of the country by the people of the country, and it is also the beginning of difficult creation. The Peaceful Nation-Building Outline, etc., jointly decided by the government to convene the Political Consultative Conference of various political parties for the sake of peaceful nation-building, must be sincerely implemented throughout the country in order to achieve the goal of peaceful unification and democracy desired by the whole country.</p>
<p>However, what we want to point out painfully is that it has been a full year since the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, but why has the suffering of our compatriots deepened instead, the worries of the country have increased instead, the glory of victory has become increasingly dim, and the martyrs who sacrificed in the War of Resistance Against Japan have not been comforted? The creation of this humiliating phenomenon is really because the unity of our country has been threatened, the nation-building plan has not been realized, and also because the Three Principles of the People have not been implemented. Therefore, we want to awaken all compatriots in the country to truly recognize: (1) the necessity of supporting unity, (2) the necessity of implementing nation-building, and even more, to urge the government to fulfill its responsibility to implement the Three Principles of the People.</p>
<p>First: We must uphold national unity, which is an essential element of nation-building. It is the guarantee of social stability and the freedom of the people, and it is also a prerequisite for the implementation of democratic nation-building. We advocated the three major goals of peace, unity, and stability at the time of the end of the War of Resistance, and we have worked hard to use peaceful negotiation methods to make the Chinese Communist Party abandon its attempts to divide the country by armed secession and achieve true national unity. The government's consistent policy is precisely the urgent prayer of our compatriots and the unanimous support of our youth across the country; however, in the past year, despite the continuous negotiations, the Communist Party has always insisted on its concept of self-owned armed forces and feudal secession, constantly attacking the National Army and expanding its territory, and must destroy the unity of the country's military orders and political orders completely, creating the phenomenon of "a country within a country" and "an army outside the National Army," and even the traffic has been cut off section by section, the economy has been divided everywhere, and the restoration and relief work cannot be carried out. If this continues, not only will the people not be able to live, but the country will not be a country. In order to maintain the results of victory and safeguard the survival of the country, all our youth should not hesitate to sacrifice freedom, sacrifice life, sacrifice everything, to ensure national unity. It is determined that the urgency of saving the country today. For acts that undermine unity, our youth across the country must unite the will and strength of the entire nation, exert public opinion, and impose sanctions.</p>
<p>Second: We must implement the national construction strategy. Resistance and nation-building were originally national policies that went hand in hand. Immediately after the victory of the War of Resistance, nation-building should begin immediately. In the past year, it has been delayed and wasted. It must not be delayed any longer. We must do our best, overcome all difficulties, and speed up the progress of construction work. (The following text turns to the third edition)</p>

<h3 id="e37">Molotov's Astonishing Speech <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>Just as the vigorous debate in international circles sparked by American Henry Wallace's speech was beginning to subside, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, at the Paris Peace Conference's Committee on Italian Political and Territorial Questions, delivered a lengthy speech, lasting over sixty minutes. While ostensibly focused on the Trieste issue, the speech's scope was broad, and its underlying meaning demanded careful consideration. Regarding the veto issue, Molotov stated that rejecting or eliminating the veto would only aid those attempting to establish an Anglo-American bloc. Ignoring the Soviet Union in the pursuit of peace would be dangerous. The United Nations, if seeking to safeguard peace without Soviet participation, or even in opposition to the Soviet Union, was bound to fail. Any attempt aimed at eliminating the veto should be regarded as a prelude to a new war and rejected. He also asserted that 19th-century democratic principles were no longer suited to the 20th century, citing Greece and Bulgaria as examples of two different forms of democracy. While elections in Greece may have been marred by fraud and foreign interference, the Soviet Union had exerted no pressure on Bulgaria's referendum. Molotov's speech thus bordered on a veiled challenge. As Molotov's first speech since returning to Paris from Moscow, its significance was undoubtedly profound.</p>
<p>Regarding the Trieste issue, Molotov advocated rejecting the drafts proposed by Britain, the United States, or France, and fully adopting the Soviet plan, which outlined the following key points: (1) The Free Territory of Trieste should be designated as a neutral and demilitarized zone; (2) All foreign troops should withdraw from the Free Territory of Trieste within thirty days after the entry into force of the treaty of peace with Italy; (3) The Free Territory of Trieste should be economically integrated with Yugoslavia; (4) The government of the Free Territory should be responsible to the People's Assembly of the territory; (5) All Italian citizens residing in the territory, with the exception of those who supported the Italian Fascist regime, held official positions in the Fascist Party, served in the Italian police, were government officials who came to the territory from Italy after 1921, or were war criminals, should be granted citizenship in the territory; (6) An Allied Council composed of Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and France should be formed to organize the interim government of the Free Territory upon the treaty's entry into force, and should solicit the opinions of local democratic groups and parties; (7) The special responsibility of the interim government should be to convene elections for the People's Assembly within three months, forming the formal government of the Free Territory. On the surface, this plan appeared fair and just, but it concealed the following problems: (1) The plan did not specify a time limit for the existence of the Free Territory, unlike the drafts proposed by Britain, the United States, and France, which stipulated a period of ten years; (2) The establishment and existence of the Free Territory would be completely detached from the control of the United Nations; (3) The acquisition of citizenship by Italian citizens in the territory was subject to certain restrictions, effectively disenfranchising tens of thousands of Italians. As a result, Yugoslavs would gain control in the territory, and since this arrangement was not time-limited and the People's Assembly would be the highest decision-making body, the People's Assembly established under the Soviet plan could very well pass legislation annexing the Free Territory of Trieste to Yugoslavia. Thus, upon closer examination, the plan appeared to greatly benefit Yugoslavia. From the perspective of an objective observer, resolving the delicate and complex Trieste issue through this plan would not be as straightforward as simply annexing the territory to Yugoslavia.</p>
<p>We cannot deny that Molotov's speech was filled with vigor, presenting an interesting contrast to Wallace's weak and powerless remarks. In summary, the key point of Molotov's speech was to</p>
<p>intimidate generally weak-willed individuals, forcing them to unconditionally accept all of the Soviet Union's policies. As the Soviet Foreign Minister, Molotov repeatedly mentioned Britain, France, and the Anglo-American bloc in his speech, as if those capitalist countries were indeed establishing anti-Soviet states. When it came to the democratic system, Molotov candidly stated that only the Soviet system was a thoroughly modern democracy that could be implemented in other countries, while the British concept of democracy was outdated. All of this, if uttered by German or Italian propaganda ministers before the downfall of the Nazis and Fascists, would not have been much different!</p>
<p>Molotov brought up the Munich Agreement, which he abhorred, a matter that everyone should certainly remember. However, people might also recall the signing of the German-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact on the eve of the outbreak of World War II in Europe. If the Munich Agreement unleashed a rabid Nazi dog, wouldn't the Moscow Pact signed by Molotov and Ribbentrop be akin to instigating that rabid dog to bite people? Let's forget about this unpleasant matter. Sincere cooperation and joint efforts to create world peace would be the best course of action.</p>
<p>Molotov's speech bluntly pointed out that the maintenance of world peace requires accepting the Soviet viewpoint, which is "Soviet Peace" (Pax Sovietica). In other words, all policies that differ from the Soviet viewpoint should be abandoned, and only the Soviet viewpoint is correct. This is truly a "world domination" centered on the Soviet Union. If the peace won at the cost of countless lives were to be built on the foundation of such a Pax Sovietica, then the heroic souls on the Pacific desert islands, in the North African deserts, on the beaches of Normandy, and on the entire Chinese battlefield would surely weep. This is an era that requires decisions! Humanity is also facing the eve of a new historical stage!</p>
<h3 id="e38">Resolution Demanding the Recovery of Hong Kong <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council passed a resolution yesterday, requesting the government to negotiate the recovery of Hong Kong, Macau, and other territories ceded or leased under unequal treaties. This resolution not only represents the views of the four million people of Shanghai, but also the unanimous desire of our entire nation of four hundred million people!</p>
<p>The unequal treaties previously signed between China and various countries began with the Treaty of Nanking after the Opium War, and the cession of Hong Kong was a product of the Treaty of Nanking, along with the opening of five treaty ports. Therefore, the recovery of ceded and leased territories should begin with Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Britain should return Hong Kong and Kowloon to China. This is an obligation that cannot be delayed, both legally and practically. During the war, the leaders of the three major powers, China, Britain, and the United States, met in Cairo to discuss long-term plans for the Far East, and in principle unanimously agreed to return Hong Kong and Kowloon to China. US senators criticized Britain for its reluctance to easily give up Hong Kong. Even British authorities have stated that once the time is ripe, they will negotiate with China to discuss the return of Hong Kong. Stephen, the new British Ambassador to China, also solemnly stated when he departed from Britain to assume his new post: "Britain has no ambition in China other than commerce; it earnestly hopes that China will become a strong, stable, and unified country. The British government will do its utmost to assist China within the greatest possible scope to ensure that China becomes a strong and unified country." Everyone believed that with the unfolding of a new chapter in Sino-British relations, the stains on the diplomatic history of the two countries could be completely erased.</p>
<p>The British rule of Hong Kong and the lease of Kowloon to Britain are both the result of Britain's past aggression against China. Now that Britain regards China as an ally, and during the war, the two countries fought shoulder to shoulder against aggression, their friendship has been strengthened through the crucible of blood. Therefore, at this moment, not only for China's sake, but especially for Britain's sake, it is most timely to eliminate the vestiges of past British imperialism and to bridge the gap between the peoples of China and Britain.</p>
<p>Since the Labour Party came to power in Britain, it has adopted enlightened policies both internally and externally. Prime Minister Attlee has allowed India to become independent and announced the withdrawal of British troops from Egypt, earning worldwide acclaim. Recently, US Secretary of Commerce Wallace delivered a speech criticizing Britain for adopting imperialist policies in the Near East, which aroused deep indignation among the British people. This shows that Britain today no longer admits to maintaining an imperialist style. Accordingly, Britain's expression of following its past imperialist path in the Far East makes it even more necessary to return Hong Kong and Kowloon to China.</p>
<p>However, Hong Kong and Kowloon have been under British rule for a century, and negotiations with our country on the return issue will take some time technically. But we must not allow the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to keep delaying the matter. Some people in Britain may still hope to postpone it, but our people have the right to urge the government to start negotiations for recovery as soon as possible. Hong Kong does occupy a very important position in Far Eastern trade. Our demand for the recovery of Hong Kong and Kowloon is to maintain the integrity of our country's territorial sovereignty, and there is no other purpose. Moreover, we can also advocate that after Hong Kong is recovered, it should still be used as a free port for international trade, making it a trade center in the Far East and Southeast Asia. This is beneficial to both China and Britain, and to the world. We support this resolution of the Shanghai Municipal Council and demand that the government attach importance to this resolution representing public opinion.</p>
<h3 id="e39">Transformation of Modern American Thought <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>Professor Fei, in a speech at Tongji University the other day, raised two important issues: first, world peace; and second, educational reform. From Professor Fei's perspective, we can see the transformation of modern American thought. Because Professor Fei himself admits that what he said is not only his personal opinion, but the opinion of the majority of modern Americans.</p>
<p>Regarding world peace, Professor Fei believes that in order to avoid war, it is necessary to establish a world police system. The police represent a kind of power, and the law cannot be enforced without power behind it. He acknowledged that this construction work is very difficult, but inevitable. Someone asked him if he believed in "power politics," and he said it depended on how it was interpreted. Just as Shanghai needs to maintain public order, it has set up a police force, but the police cannot be regarded as power politics.</p>
<p>Recently, after reading many speeches by American political authorities, scholars, and journalists, and observing many military preparations and demonstrations in the United States, we feel that behind these speeches and actions, there is indeed a new view of international relations that is latent among most Americans. Few people can say that Americans today deliberately want war and are unwilling to have peace, but their thinking is completely different from what it was after World War I. After the last war, they believed that peace could be achieved by peaceful means. After this war, while they still adopt peaceful means on the one hand, they actively prepare military force on the other hand. They clearly want to use military force to compel peace. This is a drastic change in the thinking of the average American.</p>
<p>If the world powers can, in the aftermath of this war, work together with one heart and mind, and build a world police system, the world will not be difficult to achieve peace. However, suspicion and fear arise between them, especially the increasingly acute relations between the United States and the Soviet Union. Since the United States and the Soviet Union cannot cooperate, and in order to demand world peace, everyone believes that the world police force is necessary. As a result, both countries intend to expand their own military strength to independently build the world police system. Even if their ultimate goal is peace, their current behavior seems to be tainted with the color of hegemony. The stronger the color, the deeper the suspicion, and the more difficult it is to cooperate. This is the crux of all the difficulties in the current international situation!</p>
<p>Regarding educational reform, Professor Fei gave us a surprising message. He said that many American educators advocate that students who study natural sciences and engineering should also take courses in social sciences, philosophy, and literature in the future. He also pointed out that several famous schools have extended the length of students' studies in order to complete the work of this educational ideal, such as the most famous Massachusetts Institute of Technology, which has been changed from four years to five years.</p>
<p>This reform movement originated from a new idea. Some American intellectuals, especially the experts who participated in the successful research of the atomic bomb, believe that the research on the relationship between "things and things" has reached an amazing progress, while the research on the relationship between "people and people" remains the same. But unless the latter research can catch up with the former research, scientific progress may destroy mankind itself! He pointed out that there are two aspects in the world of learning, one is Confucius, and the other is Einstein. Confucius' learning is about "people and people," and Einstein's learning is about "things and things." In today's terms, Confucius' philosophy may have many aspects that are not suitable for modern times, but his basic spirit is the most urgent need at present.</p>
<p>Standing in the position of the Chinese people, we feel that Professor Fei and the general American educators' new understanding is an unprecedented innovation for the American education system, and it provides us with a high-minded foresight for the Chinese education system. Chinese scientific research, in an era when professors can hardly maintain a minimum standard of living, is of course out of the question, and there is absolutely no danger of knowing too much. However, in the past ten years or so, the government authorities have developed a prejudice, valuing students who study science and engineering, and despising students who study literature, philosophy, and social sciences. For example, in each overseas study examination, the number of the latter is only one or two, and nine out of ten send the former. This prejudice and biased policy is unreasonable in principle. In the future, Chinese education, because of the urgent needs of the times, must not abandon scientific research, or even be in a reactionary and backward state. However, balanced development, without bias or discrimination, is at least the most sound way to cultivate young people. Our government authorities plan how to create a large number of "technical talents," and rarely plan how to create a large number of true and complete "people"! Our educators also advocate "scientific education" all day long, and rarely advocate "spiritual education" that can promote scientific application and scientific use! Professor Fei's remarks can also be regarded as a mountain stone for our future education.</p>
<p>The two issues of world peace and educational reform are interrelated. If the world is to achieve peace, human beings must help each other; and if human beings are to help each other, the majority of people in the world must thoroughly understand the relationship between people and people and understand each other. We hope that the United States will strive for educational reform in the process of transforming the two ideas, and avoid the starting point for aggression and domination; and on the Soviet side, we especially hope that the same transformation of educational ideas will also occur.</p>

<p>[Agence France-Presse, Istanbul, 15th] It has been officially announced that the Turkish fleet is scheduled to sail from Smyrna to the Aegean Sea tomorrow for naval exercises. It is unknown whether the British and American fleets, which are also conducting exercises in the Aegean Sea at the same time, will meet. According to Turkish officials, the three fleets may not sail in single file through the Dardanelles Strait, as such a move would be too blatant a political action against the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Cairo, 15th] Egyptian government sources recently stated that after the recent visit of Egyptian King Farouk to Turkey, it is expected that relations between the two countries will have new developments in the shortest possible time. Although King Farouk's visit was informal in nature, Egyptian Prime Minister Nuqrashi Pasha issued a public statement to the press, strongly stating that King Farouk's visit to Turkey will have a satisfactory impact on relations between the two countries. In addition, King Farouk's inspection tour in the Red Sea area also visited Yanbu, which will also improve relations between Egypt and Saudi Arabia. Furthermore, Britain is very interested in the possibility of improved relations between Egypt and Turkey. In addition, the dispute between Turkey and Syria over the issue of the Alexandretta region may also be resolved through Egyptian mediation.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Cairo, 16th] The London correspondent of the Egyptian newspaper "Al-Misri" reports that if the negotiations between the Soviet Union and Turkey on revising the status of the Turkish Dardanelles Strait fail, Britain may propose that Britain, the United States, Greece, and Turkey conclude a military alliance. As for Egypt, it does not need to openly participate in such an alliance, because according to the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty, Egypt follows Britain's lead. According to the four-nation alliance plan, the land and air forces will be under the command of the United States, the navy will be under the command of Britain, and the headquarters will be located in Ankara, with supply stations in Beirut. This Turkish plan has not yet been confirmed.</p>
<h3 id="e42">US and British Representatives Firmly Advocate the Establishment of a Free State in Trieste; Should Be Separated from Direct Relations with Italy and Yugoslavia; It is Feared That the Peace Conference Will Be Difficult to Conclude Before the UN General Assembly <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>[Our Report] London, 16th Broadcast: The Committee on Italian Political and Territorial Questions held a meeting in Paris today to discuss the Trieste issue. British and American representatives reiterated their determination that Trieste should be separated from Italy and Yugoslavia, and also from the political conspiracies of any country.</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 16th] US Democratic Senator Connally today demanded that the Peace Conference establish a truly Free State of Trieste, not dependent on Yugoslavia or Italy. Connally further cited the principles agreed upon by the Council of Foreign Ministers regarding Trieste, stating that for the sake of peace, these agreements should be respected. "We must make Trieste a symbol of world peace and security." Earlier, Yugoslav Deputy Prime Minister Kardelj delivered a speech in the Italian Political Committee for an hour, claiming that Western powers were attempting to "draw a great iron curtain in the Mediterranean region." The Slavic bloc launched a movement to allow Yugoslavia to have control over the Free Territory of Trieste. The opposition of the United States and Britain to the Slavic demands is only to protect their rights in the Mediterranean. Their motives are neither concerned with the people of Trieste nor concerned with the people of Italy. According to Kardelj, he supports the Yugoslav proposal to have Trieste's customs and foreign affairs attached to Yugoslavia, while the Trieste government will be jointly established by the Four Powers Committee.</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 15th] The Paris Peace Conference has now entered its eighth week, but less than one-third of the work has been completed. The biggest disputes at present are two points: one is the Italian issue, and the other is the border dispute between Greece and Albania. The situation is tense and is about to reach the brink. Therefore, it seems highly unlikely that the work of the Paris Peace Conference can be concluded before the UN General Assembly convenes on October 23. These two issues are not only difficult for the Peace Conference itself, but also pose a crisis in the relationship between the Soviet Union and Western countries. The fate of the Free Port of Trieste is the biggest obstacle to the Peace Conference, and this issue has caused repeated twists and turns in the Four Powers Foreign Ministers Conference this spring. After the Four Powers finally agreed to designate the port as a free port, a small committee was formed to plan the detailed plan for the future establishment of the government of Trieste. However, as soon as this subcommittee met, its handling was tricky due to differences of opinion between the Soviet Union and the United States, Britain, and France. The same situation also occurred in the Paris Peace Conference. In short, the United States, Britain, France, and their countries all agree that Trieste should be international in nature, and its administrator should be appointed by the United Nations. Also, Trieste should be equally detached from direct relations with Italy and Yugoslavia. The administrator has broad powers in the free territory of the port. However, the Soviet plan proposed by Molotov wants a people's assembly to be elected by all the people of the port, and the administrative power of the port should be largely granted to this people's assembly. As for the power of the administrator, it should be strictly limited and not be responsible to the Security Council, but to the Four Powers. As for the issue of the Albanian-Greek border, there are also differences of opinion between the Eastern and Western blocs. The previous Four Powers Foreign Ministers Conference decided that representatives from Albania and Greece should present their views at the Peace Conference. At present, this dispute is being handled by the Peace Conference's Bulgarian Territorial Committee. Although Albania was formerly an enemy country, it demanded that the entire region of Western Thrace be assigned to Albania so as to obtain an outlet to the Aegean Sea. It has now formally proposed an amendment to the boundary, but Greece only requests a slight modification along the current boundary. The country did not formally propose a boundary amendment until last Friday.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 16th] Local newspapers report that the Soviet Union has delayed submitting a draft on the principles of the basic issue of organizing an international guard army, thereby delaying the work of the United Nations Military Staff Committee, because the drafts of the other four powers have already been submitted. The Military Staff Committee has been holding secret meetings since March 26 this year, and little is known about its activities. What is known is that the committee has carefully considered the draft of its rules of procedure and procedure.

<h3 id="e48">Newspaper Report from the New York Scripps-Howard Group: Calls for Wallace to Step Down; Truman's Approval of Speech Revealed <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] London Broadcast from Paris, 16th: The British Foreign Office spokesperson stated today that regarding the Wallace speech issue, the British government has made no diplomatic representations to Washington. This matter will be addressed by the Americans themselves in response to Wallace, it is said.</p>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Broadcast from San Francisco, 16th: Today, the New York Scripps-Howard newspapers published an editorial stating that Wallace has caused too much trouble for Truman and his cabinet. He should no longer use his position in the cabinet to conduct "harmful activities." He should resign from the position of Secretary of Commerce; otherwise, he should be forced to take this step. The newspaper's Washington correspondent, Childs, described the process of President Truman's approval of Wallace's speech, stating that Truman never had the full text of the speech in hand. When Wallace went to the White House, he hastily read out several sections of the speech, which were not anti-British, but supported American foreign policy. Truman said, "We all agree on this point; I certainly agree." Later, after the State Department received the initial draft of the speech, Deputy Secretary of State Clayton tried to persuade Truman to cancel the speech. However, the initial draft was already being transmitted by radio, so President Truman and his advisors believed that canceling the speech would have even more adverse effects.</p>
<h3 id="e49">US Drafts New Military Program Based on Atomic Bombs and Other Weapons (Arctic Ocean as the First Line of Defense for the Americas) <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>[United Press Washington, 15th] The Department of the Army revealed today that the American military authorities have abolished the military program of the Second World War and replaced it with a new military program. This new program, based on atomic bombs, radio-controlled missiles, and electronic inventions, has been drafted by the General Staff and has begun to be taught at the Army War College in Washington and the Command and General Staff School in Fort Leavenworth. The revisions to the military program include the following: (1) Expanded use of airborne infantry and paratroopers. (2) Intensified cooperation between ground forces and airborne forces. (3) Replacing the triangular divisions used in World War II with divisions composed of three combat units. (4) Using rockets and missiles for long-range bombardment. (5) Expanding the use of atomic bombs in radio-controlled missiles. (6) Taking the Arctic Ocean as the first line of defense for the American continent, with the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans as flanking defenses. (7) Intensified cooperation between the Army, civilians, and scientists. (8) Close cooperation between intelligence units and the Army, civilians, and scientists. (9) Organizing a strong air force with long-range bombing capabilities, training aviation detachments and air reserves. (10) Establishing a chemical warfare branch. (11) Developing radio-controlled missiles.</p>
<p>US Troop Numbers Sharply Declining [Report from our newspaper] Broadcast from Washington, 16th: A year ago, the total number of US troops was 12.1 million; a little over a year after Japan's surrender, the number of US troops has been reduced to 2.3 million, about one-sixth of the wartime peak strength. By the end of June next year, the number of US troops will be reduced again to 1,615,200, but this number only represents the "core" of the US Army, Navy, and Air Force, which can be rapidly expanded, making it more powerful than before Pearl Harbor. At that time, the US military could muster 450,000 troops.</p>
<p>Nimitz Discusses Troop Reductions [United Press, Philadelphia, USA, 16th] Chief of Naval Operations Nimitz declared here today that the US Navy currently has 500,000 personnel, one-sixth of the peak number during the war, which is large enough. He advocated an annual review in order to gradually reduce the number. All US Navy personnel who wish to leave have been allowed to do so, except for 3,000 naval personnel who remain in hospitals to care for wounded soldiers. Just as one cannot consider soldiers to be useless roots. As of today, science has yet to invent something that can replace soldiers.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Budapest, 15th] The leader of Hungary's newly formed opposition Liberal Party, Szurdiuk, advocates that smaller European nations form an alliance with France to create a "fourth power." Szurdiuk stated in parliament that current world affairs are directed by the three major powers. Britain is too far or too close to the continent, the United States is in the Americas, and the Soviet Union itself is equivalent to a continent. Hungary should not become an appendage of any of the aforementioned three powers. France is the most culturally advanced power on the European continent. Although France is still busy dealing with its internal affairs, I believe that France will soon regain its position in major political events. Smaller European nations must rally around France to form a fourth power and participate in the work of the United Nations. Szurdiuk's speeches show that his Liberal Party is a left-wing democratic and Catholic party.</p>

<p>[Remodeling Society, Tokyo, 16th] The International Tribunal convened at 9:30 am today. Two defendants, Matsui, who had not been present for a long time, were also seen to be thin. Except for Okawa, all other 26 defendants were present. The prosecutor first finished presenting the situation of Japanese troops using prisoners on the Siam-Burma Railway, which had not been completed last week.

In a small guardhouse, as many as 57 men and women were detained, sitting with their knees bent for countless hours, and were not released for months. One European was tortured for 55 hours, another was beaten 144 times, and Japanese soldiers poured water into the mouths and noses of those arrested. The various atrocities were endless.</p>
<h3 id="e57">Yoshida Cabinet's Position Becomes More Stable <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>Liberal and Progressive Parties to Merge</p>
<p>[Our Tokyo Correspondent, 16th] When the Yoshida Cabinet was formed, the people recognized it as a constitutional cabinet, that is, the purpose of the Yoshida Cabinet was to amend the constitution and submit it for passage at this session of the Provisional Diet. After the Diet session ended, it would collapse. However, the session of this Diet has been specially extended, and there is talk of further extensions, and Yoshida himself seems confident that he can maintain his cabinet until the Japanese peace conference. Generally speaking, such confidence on Yoshida's part is not impossible to realize. Because foreign trade is about to open up, the food shortage has gradually eased, and the Socialist Party's offensive against the government is not as fierce as imagined. In the negotiations of this National Railway labor strike, the Socialist Party's attitude was quite moderate and did not take unified action with the Communist Party. In the statement, it only hoped for a satisfactory solution, fearing that this strike would develop into a general political strike. The Communist Party originally wanted to transform this National Railway labor strike into a nationwide political strike, and then overthrow the Yoshida Cabinet, but this plan ultimately failed. The National Railway labor strike suddenly reached a compromise one night and canceled the decision to strike, which of course cannot be attributed entirely without the support of foreign aid forces. The resolution of the National Railway labor strike can be said to be a tonic for the Yoshida Cabinet, which is why the Liberal Party supported Yoshida as president. The Liberal and Progressive parties acknowledge that Yoshida will remain Prime Minister when the Japanese peace conference is held, and Progressive Party President Hiranuma will serve as the plenipotentiary representative to the peace conference. Therefore, the merger of the Liberal and Progressive parties can be achieved. Recently, rumors of a merger between the Liberal and Progressive parties have been growing, and it is recognized that it is possible to achieve this by next spring. Currently, the Liberal and Progressive parties have a total of 250 seats in the Diet, just over half, but Yoshida is still worried about his weakness and is trying to win over minority parties. Yoshida's recent reception of the Shinseikai also shows Yoshida's attempt to win over various parties.</p>

<h3 id="e60">Youth Corps Second National Congress Declaration: Text Continued from Page Two <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>We believe that the biggest obstacle to national construction at present is the inertia of the general public after the war, and also due to the sabotage and obstruction of the Communist Party. We want to revive the economy and build society, while the Communist Party destroys transportation and breaches dikes. We want to prosper the countryside and restore industry; while the Communist Party wants to destroy the countryside and destroy industry. We want to coordinate agricultural and industrial production to improve people's lives; while the Communist Party separates agriculture from industry and isolates cities from villages. As for the overall construction: if transportation cannot be restored, materials cannot circulate, the economy is divided, and society is in chaos, of course, endless difficulties will be added; but the pain of our people's livelihood cannot be relieved without intensifying national construction, and the survival and development of the country cannot be guaranteed without intensifying national construction. Therefore, our national youth must recognize their goals, take responsibility, endure hardship, eliminate the inertia of complacency and fear of difficulty, work together, break through any obstacles and difficulties, and intensify our work of national construction to comfort the spirits of the martyrs of the Anti-Japanese War. Regarding the implementation of the Three Principles of the People, it is the unshirkable responsibility of the government. We believe that the implementation of nationalism has already achieved considerable success, and what urgently needs to be done now is the thorough implementation of democracy and people's livelihood. Regarding democracy, we believe that it is necessary to establish the rule of law, guarantee freedom, rectify political morality, eliminate corruption, improve administrative efficiency, effectively implement local self-government, establish people's representative organs at all levels, improve grassroots political organizations, and support the real power of the people, so that democratic constitutionalism has a solid foundation. Regarding people's livelihood, we believe that the government should be determined to earnestly implement the policy of equalizing land ownership and controlling capital. Regarding the former, it is necessary to effectively implement the 25% rent reduction, implement land laws and regulations, equalize land distribution, ensure that tillers have their land, and advocate the establishment of cooperative farms and collective farms to increase agricultural production and improve farmers' lives. Regarding the latter, it is necessary to strengthen financial management, suppress high-interest exploitation, guide commercial capital towards industrial production, promote labor-management coordination, protect the interests of workers, support agricultural and industrial organizations, establish a social insurance system, and effectively promote cooperative undertakings such as production, transportation, and consumption. Only in this way can our work of revolutionary national construction not be empty talk, and can we gain the trust of compatriots throughout the country. (We are confident that we are enthusiastic, brave, and pure Chinese revolutionary youth.) We have revolutionary beliefs and are by no means pessimistic about the future of China and the world. We believe that the Three Principles of the People is a doctrine that follows the principles of heaven, responds to human feelings, conforms to the trend of the world, and meets the needs of the people. As long as we work hard to implement it, there is no reason why it will not succeed. We all have a service-oriented, creative, correct, and noble outlook on life. We care about Chinese politics and the future of the country and nation, and are willing to sacrifice, struggle, and contribute everything to complete the great cause of revolutionary national construction. We are willing to maintain the loyalty and purity of youth for a long time and eliminate the secular idea of ​​getting promoted and making a fortune. We Youth Corps members pledge to abide by the Corps charter, serve the people, and sacrifice for the revolution. We are willing to be an unsung hero of revolutionary national construction. We absolutely abide by national laws and regulations and strictly abide by the disciplines of our country. We pledge to be believers in the Three Principles of the People and, under the leadership of our Corps Leader, do our best to build the country, and strive to be fighters for the national revolution. What we urgently request from the government today is to give the young men and women of our country ample opportunities for further education and employment, to give them ample opportunities to participate in grassroots national construction work, to cultivate the spirit of independent creation of young men and women, to strengthen all kinds of science and education related to national construction in national schools, and to be responsible for educating and supporting young compatriots in the border areas and overseas, so that all young people in the country learn modern knowledge and skills and concentrate under the banner of the Three Principles of the People to create a new China owned by the people, governed by the people, and enjoyed by the people.</p>
<p>(4) Our Corps has been established for eight years. Our Corps members have been constantly admonishing and earnestly expecting us to be revolutionary cadres and to make us the driving force of national construction. However, reviewing the past, the organization is not strict enough, and the work is not solid enough. For any aspect of the Corps, we need to make further efforts. We deeply miss every comrade who struggled and sacrificed his life against the enemy puppets during the Anti-Japanese War. In order to carry forward their glorious history, we should be more vigorous, self-improving, and unremitting to improve our Youth Corps.</p>
<p>We feel that in order to adapt to the needs of the times and strengthen the revolutionary forces, to eliminate the obstacles to revolutionary national construction, and to achieve the task of revolutionary national construction, our Corps must enrich the interior and strengthen the organization, such as the establishment of the democratic centralism system, grassroots organizational cadres, the implementation of policies, the recruitment of outstanding talents, etc., all of which are related to the future success or failure of the Corps. Detailed methods have now been determined and must be strictly implemented. This conference of ours has even more important decisions for the entire party: (1) Clearly stipulate the direction of the Corps' work in the future, so that the efforts of our Corps members in the future can be more practical and progressive; (2) Under the same doctrine and the same leader, the Party and the Corps share the common task of national revolution, but the cadres of the Party and the Corps are clearly divided, so that each specializes in its duties and does its best, so that the cadres have specific responsibilities and the work has specialized contributions, so that our Corps becomes a sound and strong revolutionary group of Three Principles of the People youth, and fulfills its important responsibilities to the times.</p>
<p>Finally, we would like to emphasize a few points: (1) The direction of the Corps members' efforts in the future is to tend towards active construction, and to shift from empty political activities to grassroots social service work. We must recognize that the root cause of our cultural and economic backwardness is the poison of the thousands of years of the wrong idea of ​​the literati and officials who get something for nothing, which leads to the separation of knowledge and production, and the separation of knowledge and occupation. In the future, we must be determined to establish professional positions, enter farms, factories, mines, enter the border areas, and participate in actual production work, in order to correct the general atmosphere of idleness and lay the foundation for national construction. (2) We are all Chinese youth. We must be independent and self-reliant in spirit and never lose self-confidence. We must not unknowingly become slaves to others. Of course, we must learn from others as much as possible in science and technology; but we must especially remember that we learn from others to enrich ourselves, not to lose ourselves. (3) We respect academic freedom and freedom of thought. Regarding the study of communism and the belief in communism, we stand on the position of academic freedom of thought and do not oppose it; however, the Communist Party's behavior of undermining national unity, disrupting social order, and destroying national morality not only destroys the future of our country, but also harms our youth as slaves. We truly patriotic youth must never tolerate it. (4) We firmly believe that we can only do something after we have not done something. We do not become officials, we despise politicians, we must work hard in various construction works, and are willing to contribute our mind and energy to social services and to production undertakings. We believe that transforming society is the fundamental way to transform politics, and building society is the fundamental way to build the country. If the country abandons various undertakings in society and does not harmonize, then clarifying politics and building the country will never have hope. (5) We must develop the ability to make correct judgments, distinguish right from wrong, and distinguish good from bad. We must oppose any dark forces that use our youth, deceive our youth, lure our youth, and make our youth embark on harming the country, harming the nation, and disrupting social morality, and we must thoroughly eliminate them. Every one of us youth has an independent and autonomous personality and has a sacred obligation to the country and nation. We must never allow others to use us to harm our country, harm our nation, disrupt our unity, disrupt our revolution, and thus ruin the future of our youth. I want to awaken the youth of the whole country, raise vigilance, and be wary of people who come to use our youth and harm our youth. (6) We must follow the Corps Leader's instructions in "China's Destiny" and the decisions of the First National Congress, earnestly call on the youth of the whole country to participate in the five major constructions, and the Corps members should take the lead in advocating and serving as a demonstration. We must pay more attention to scientific research, and it is necessary to implement social services, and cultivate our youth and train our youth from practical work. Otherwise, they will not be youth of the Three Principles of the People. Our Youth Corps must not tolerate such backward youth and recognize them as Corps members and comrades.</p>
<p>What we have said above is our common understanding, which is the call we have made on behalf of the youth of the country. Extraordinary times require extraordinary undertakings and extraordinary efforts. Our generation must not relax our mission to the times. Everything can be given to others, only the obligations and responsibilities to the country and the nation cannot be given to others. Everything can be compromised, only those who harm the interests of the country and the nation cannot be compromised. Comrades! Compatriots! The wind and rain are dark, but the rooster crows incessantly. We must unite as one, overcome difficulties, destroy the obstacles to the revolution, and save our country. We must take responsibility, hold high the torch of the Three Principles of the People, and strive forward, so that the new China of the Three Principles of the People and the new world of universal love and great harmony will be realized before us as soon as possible.

<h3 id="e61">City Council Commemorative Week: Speaker Pan's Earnest Words, Hoping Councilors Demonstrate True Democratic Spirit and Conduct Reasonable Scrutiny of the Municipal Government Budget <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Speaker Pan stated in his address during the Commemorative Week: "Since the City Council began, it feels as if we have already walked halfway. The past week's agenda has been filled with reports and inquiries. In addition, we have held two subcommittee reviews and one full council review, but we have not yet reached the stage of discussion and resolution. Whether the mission can be completed still depends on our efforts this week. Currently, the outside world is very concerned about this council because its mission is extremely important. How the spirit of democracy is manifested in Shanghai, and thus in China, depends entirely on this council. The Shanghai Evening Post has criticized, saying: If you want to know the spirit of popular opinion bodies under the Kuomintang government, you only need to look at the current Shanghai City Council. Therefore, today, with the utmost sincerity, I hope that everyone will demonstrate the best performance and achievements in implementing a democratic political system. We must use a truth-seeking attitude to distinguish right from wrong, so that people understand that we are indeed sincere and genuine representatives of the people. Secondly, some people often think that the council and the government are in opposing positions, but this view is not a true understanding of democracy. For example, the British government itself is formed by the parliament, so of course there is no mutual opposition. Although China is still in a transitional period, and the municipal government has not yet reached the stage of being democratically elected, if we regard the entire Shanghai as a large company, the citizens are the shareholders, the municipal government is the management, and the council is like the board of directors, it is definitely not a mutually hostile relationship. The Shanghai Evening Post also said: Whether Shanghai continues to develop into a world-renowned metropolis or regresses into a second-rate, unimportant city in the future, the responsibility lies entirely with this council. Therefore, we must especially value our role as an institution that provides direction and decides policies. I hope to encourage everyone to work together to complete this important task. I hope that the budget review can be completed no later than the fourth subcommittee meeting. Regarding the municipal government's work plan, my personal thought is that the work plan is actually an explanation of the budget. It is really ridiculous that everyone is now separating them. Fortunately, almost three months have passed in the second half of the year. If this review cannot achieve the ideal result, we must proceed cautiously in the next year. If we want the municipal government to do things, we must give it money. Without money, how can things be done? Although we should, of course, still save where we can. Reviewing the budget and final accounts is really the focus of this council's mission. If we can perform well in this regard, we will lay the cornerstone of democratic politics. Therefore, we should conduct a reasonable review of this budget. As long as the municipal government is truly doing things, we should give it money, whether it is through increased taxes or issuing public bonds. This is my personal opinion."</p>
<h3 id="e62">Armed Agencies Cannot Be Driven Away; They Erect Machine Guns to Resist: Dai Jimin Reports on the Numerous Difficulties in Housing Allocation <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>After a ten-minute break following Commemorative Week, Dai Jimin, Secretary-General of the Housing Allocation Committee, reported on the committee's work as follows:</p>
<p>The Housing Allocation Committee was only established on April 20 of this year. Previously, there were approximately 8,000 Japanese-owned houses in the Hongkou district. After the Japanese residents were successively repatriated in February and March, the remaining houses were occupied by powerful individuals. The Japanese Property Management Office, together with the municipal government and relevant agencies, organized a cleanup team to investigate. The results were found to be very bad. The Executive Yuan believed that it was necessary to establish a specialized agency to handle the matter, so preparations began on April 18, and the Housing Allocation Committee was established on April 20. The mayor serves concurrently as the chairman, and the committee is divided into general affairs, investigation, execution, and allocation groups. Existing personnel from relevant agencies were transferred to perform the work.</p>
<p>After its establishment, the initial plan was to first clarify the supply and demand situation, such as the number of houses available for allocation and the number needed by various agencies, and then allocate them fairly. However, in fact, the investigation work took a lot of time, and it was not completed by the end of July, so the method was changed: investigation and allocation were carried out simultaneously.</p>
<p>The allocation standard is based on the order in which applications are submitted, which are then submitted to the general assembly for review and approval. In fact, there are fewer than 200 truly vacant houses; the rest have already been occupied. For those agencies or private individuals who have moved in without authorization, the Allocation Committee allows them to fill out reports for review. Those who meet the regulations are issued permits, and those who do not meet the regulations are attempted to be evicted. However, eviction is very difficult. Some armed agencies simply cannot be driven away and even erect machine guns to resist. Later, they had no choice but to negotiate with their supervising agencies. In addition, for houses that originally had owners, the China Trust Bureau (中信局) uniformly leases them, so that the owners receive reasonable rent.</p>
<p>Of the more than 8,000 houses, some are municipal properties and are not included in the allocation. Only over 5,000 houses are available for allocation, while the number of applications from various parties requires more than 10,000 houses. Currently, permits have been issued for 2,439 houses, allocated to the Army 987 houses, the Air Force 136 houses, the Navy 79 houses, and others 1,237 houses. Among them, 1,524 houses were occupied first and then issued permits.</p>

<h3 id="e64">Councilors' Representatives Gathered Yesterday to Discuss Participating in the Takeover and Investigation Team <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The five representatives of the City Council who will participate in the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Takeover Work Investigation Team received appointment letters yesterday, inviting them to participate in the work of the first group of the team (i.e., the investigation related to the Shanghai-Hangzhou area). They were also invited to attend the team's routine meeting at the Jiangsu Supervisory Office at 10:00 AM tomorrow (the 18th). The council representatives were convened by Zhao Junhao yesterday to discuss preliminary measures for participating in the investigation work.</p>
<h3 id="e65">Housing Allocation Subject to Criticism; Illegal Seizures Should Be Sanctioned; Demanding the Executive Yuan to Come Up With a Solution; Councilors' Interrogations Stirred Up Emotions <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>Councilors' interrogations regarding the Housing Allocation Committee were very heated. Eleven speakers, including Lu Huimin, Qu Yue, and Lu Yinchu, raised several points in their inquiries:</p>
<p>(1) The report's content is too vague, and the figures are not detailed enough. What is the total number of houses seized from the enemy that the Housing Allocation Committee received, and where are they located? A detailed disclosure is required.</p>
<p>(2) There are many unfair situations in the already allocated houses. Some individuals have been allocated two or three houses and are selling them for gold bars, while many public education agencies cannot be allocated any houses at all. What are the standards that the Allocation Committee is using? The names of the agencies and individuals that have been allocated houses must be made public.</p>
<p>(3) Illegal seizures are not only a disregard for the law, but also a national disgrace. This phenomenon must be corrected. The Allocation Committee should publish the names of those seizing agencies in detail in the newspaper and use the power of public opinion to sanction them.</p>
<p>(4) The government must issue a law that must be enforced. The Housing Allocation Measures are stipulated by the Executive Yuan. The Executive Yuan is the highest executive agency. If the laws and regulations it sets cannot be enforced, who else can enforce them? In fact, the original measures do have inappropriate aspects and should be revised or new measures should be formulated.</p>
<p>Chen Peide specifically raised the issue of Xie Jinyuan's widow's residence. He said that the government had long issued a clear order that the families of martyrs should have houses to live in. Why hasn't she been allocated one yet?</p>
<p>Zhang Zhihan believes that relying solely on the power of public opinion is not enough to stop the trend of seizures. He advocates that the council organize an agency with the support of all citizens to strengthen the work of housing allocation.</p>
<p>Wang Jian'e raised specific facts, saying that the district office needs a place to work, and there are three houses in the district: one is occupied by Zha Liangjian, one is used by the Security Department's Detective Team, and one is used by the Military Police. When he asked the Allocation Committee, the reply was that they were already occupied, so don't think about them anymore. He wants to ask: What exactly does "allocation" mean?</p>
<h3 id="e66">Continuing Budget Review: The Ninth Group Held Its Fourth Meeting Yesterday; Heads of Various Bureaus Attended and Reported Separately <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>The City Council held review meetings simultaneously in ten groups yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM. The ninth group was the most important because it continued to review the municipal government's new budget for the second half of the year. The ninth group held its fourth meeting yesterday, and various bureaus continued to report on their financial revenues and expenditures and budgets. In addition to oral reports, written materials were submitted to the council for reference. Attendees included the municipal government's accountant, heads of various bureaus, and accounting directors, totaling more than ten people. The meeting was presided over by Xu Yongzuo, the convener of the group. Councilors raised questions about any unclear or insufficiently detailed points in the reports of various bureaus, and the responsible bureaus supplemented their explanations.</p>
<p>Public Utilities</p>
<p>First, Zhao Huijue, Director of the Public Utilities Bureau, reported on the bureau's total budget for the second half of the year, totaling 4.3 billion yuan, of which regular administrative management expenses accounted for 16% of the total budget, operating expenses accounted for 62%, and subsidies for operating expenses accounted for 11%. Then, the affiliated agencies reported on the operating revenue and expenditure budget for the second half of the year for the Public Bus Preparatory Office. The revenue was 3.6 billion yuan, equal to the expenditure. Expansion expenses were 2.2 billion yuan, part of which was a loan and part of which was subsidized by the municipal government. The Pudong Water Company's operating revenue was 5.85 million yuan, the water supply station 3.93 million yuan, and the ship water supply 3.28 million yuan. On the expenditure side: personnel and vehicle expenses were approximately 8 million yuan, start-up costs were 2 million yuan, chemical testing fees were 2 million yuan, and miscellaneous expenses were 2 million yuan. The Municipal Ferry Management Office's operating revenue was 1 billion yuan, offsetting the expenses, and the expenditure on improved assets after increased construction was 300 million yuan. The Wusong Coal Gas Plant's operating revenue was 740 million yuan, offsetting the expenses, and the expansion expenses were 1.3 billion yuan, which is expected to be completed within one year.</p>
<p>Police</p>
<p>Next, Yu Shuping, Deputy Director of the Police Bureau, reported. Yu said that the police bureau's budget was compiled based on the bureau's regular operations, as the bureau's work should be to consolidate public security, prohibit opium, manage traffic, rectify customs, organize the city appearance, and strengthen fire protection. The staffing was determined based on the importance of various tasks. According to the staffing, the total number of people was 20,000, and the current number was 13,000, a ratio of 1 to 300 to the citizens. Yu then analyzed the various fee categories and needs of the new budget and cited examples comparing them with the police expenses of the former concessions. "In the past, police expenses in the concessions accounted for 50% of the annual expenditure, and fire protection fees were an additional 4%, for a total of 54%, while according to the current new budget, it only accounts for 22% of the annual expenditure," he said.</p>
<p>Social Affairs</p>
<p>Li Jianhua, Deputy Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, reported that the bureau's budget for the second half of the year should be its minimum limit, such as the winter relief fund of only 35 million yuan, and the three public memorial ceremonies of only 3 million yuan. Other items include 30 million yuan for purchasing, repairing, and printing expenses, 14 million yuan for business and guidance operating expenses, 900,000 yuan for agricultural and forestry expansion guidance expenses, 1 million yuan for company and factory investigation guidance expenses, 1 million yuan for other investigation guidance expenses, 5 million yuan for small loan loss expenses, and 15 million yuan for relief business subsidy expenses.</p>
<p>Health</p>
<p>Zhang Wei, Director of the Health Bureau, reported that the funding for the second half of the year only increased by one time compared to the first half of the year. The plan is to achieve 70% technology and 30% administration. The total budget for the Health Bureau in the second half of the year is 13.6 billion yuan, of which administrative expenses account for 3.4%, and business management expenses account for 95.6%, including medical and equipment expenses accounting for 34.9%, environmental health accounting for 46.8%, health care expenses accounting for 12.7%, and epidemic prevention expenses accounting for 5.6%.</p>
<p>Education</p>
<p>Li Ximou, Deputy Director of the Education Bureau, reported that the total budget for the second half of the year is 16.2 billion yuan, 1.3 billion yuan for adding classes and starting expenses, more than 550 million yuan for supplementary equipment for municipal schools and institutions, 300 million yuan for board expenses for normal school students, 1 billion yuan for subsidies to private schools and institutions, and only 25 million yuan for administrative affairs. At the same time, the Civil Affairs Office also submitted a written report.</p>
<p>After the reports were completed, the councilors briefly expressed their opinions and adjourned the meeting, and decided to hold another closed-door review meeting tonight, and the heads of various bureaus were still invited to attend.</p>
<h3 id="e67">Regarding Public Utilities and Public Works <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>The fifth review committee had about 80 proposals related to public utilities and public works, so at the third review meeting yesterday, it was passed to merge all the proposals into 20 major cases. Two cases were discussed yesterday:</p>
<p>Unify Transportation Routes, Improve Traffic</p>
<p>(1) Regarding unifying tram and bus routes, increasing vehicles, improving traffic, and training staff, it is proposed that the Public Utilities Bureau be instructed to urge the relevant companies to implement it conscientiously. It was discussed by merging eight cases. After the review, four points were initially resolved: (1) Public utilities should be operated by private companies in principle. (2) The China Merchant Electricity Company should be quickly restored and protected. (3) Public buses should also be handled according to the first principle. (4) The methods discussed in the relevant proposals should be compiled by the secretary and sent to the Public Utilities Bureau for reference.</p>
<p>Restricting Electricity Use, Discontinuing Electric Heating</p>
<p>(2) Regarding the proposal to request the municipal government to restrict electricity consumption, it was reviewed by merging seven cases. As a result, the following was initially resolved: (1) To restrict electricity consumption for heating, it is proposed that the power company not be allowed to provide electric heating again this winter. The French Power Company will resume connecting electricity next month, which should be canceled. According to Zhao Zengjue, Director of the Public Utilities Bureau, if electric heating is stopped, 20,000 kilowatts can be saved, so the city's electricity will no longer need to be worried about. (2) Restricting electricity use should be based on the electricity consumption record of February of this year. For newly installed electricity users, it should be based on the electricity consumption record of August. Those who violate the regulations three times should be severely punished. Detailed measures will be formulated by the Public Utilities Bureau. (3) Military electricity should be charged to show restriction. It is proposed that the municipal government submit a request to the Ministry of National Defense to issue an order to the military to pay for the lamp oil fees for electricity use.</p>
<h3 id="e68">Soldiers Who Seize Houses Will Be Severely Punished According to Military Law; They Must All Evacuate Before the End of the Month <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>When the Songhu Garrison Headquarters held a week of fasting yesterday morning, Commander Xuan made an important report on the matter of soldiers seizing houses, stating that he had just received a telegram from Chairman Chiang, ordering that soldiers who illegally seize houses must immediately evacuate voluntarily. If it is verified, they will be severely punished according to military law. Xuan also stated that those who seize houses must evacuate before the end of the month, and those who fail to do so will be dealt with according to military law. Xuan will also convene a meeting of army, navy, and air force generals in the coming days.</p>
<h3 id="e69">Organizing an Observation Group to Investigate Foreign Education; Li Ximou Submitted a Proposal to Use the Education Bureau's Stipulated Subsidy for Private Schools to Supplement Free Quotas <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>The sixth review committee reviewed proposals related to education and culture, with Zhou Feicheng as chairman. First, similar proposals were merged and divided into more than twenty categories, such as increasing municipal primary schools, subsidizing private primary and secondary schools, increasing public schools, vocational schools, normal schools, and increasing teacher salaries.</p>
<p>Regarding the education budget, the municipal government stipulates that it accounts for 19.7% of the total budget. All members of this group believe that it should be increased, otherwise, educational construction cannot be started. Increasing it to 30% is the most ideal, and it should at least account for 25%.</p>
<p>There were 19 proposals related to increasing municipal primary schools, and two review committee members were assigned to sort them out. Due to time constraints, they were not reviewed.</p>
<p>Yesterday's main review work was related to the issue of tuition fees for private schools. Recently, councilors have strongly criticized the unrestricted tuition fees of private schools, so the committee members were very cautious when reviewing this case. Finally, the following review opinion was passed: "The tuition fees for private primary and secondary schools should be requested by the municipal government to be stipulated according to the price situation at that time, and detailed standards for use and distribution should be established and strictly supervised. Those who deliberately violate them should be punished."</p>
<p>Several private school principals who attended this group's review gave explanations on the tuition fees of private schools. They all believe that if they want to strengthen the teaching staff and develop education, the current tuition fees cannot be said to be too high. Li Ximou, Deputy Director of the Education Bureau, was also present and proposed that in addition to strictly stipulating a 20% free quota, the private school subsidy stipulated by the Education Bureau should be used to supplement the number of free places. The committee members also decided to report the situation of tuition fees in private schools at the general meeting and detail the difficulties.</p>
<p>As for the teacher respect fee, it has been decided to propose that it should not be collected at all levels of primary and secondary schools starting from the next semester. Regarding the case where teachers in various schools who have worked for ten years should be given one year of rest, with salaries and benefits paid as usual, it is proposed that the municipal government should implement it conscientiously.</p>
<p>The Education Bureau submitted a proposal to send an education observation group to investigate education abroad to serve as a reference for the restoration of the city's education. After review, the following method was decided: The Education Bureau should hire those who have contributed to the city's education and culture and those who have served in the city's education sector for more than ten years and have achieved outstanding results to form a foreign observation group.</p>
<p>Finally, it was decided to make a resolution on the Education Bureau's work report, and Huang Shijin, Chen Baotai, and Wang Liben were responsible for drafting it.</p>
<h3 id="e70">Reviewing Finance and Land Administration: Preliminary Resolutions on Important Cases <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>The third group reviewed finance and land administration proposals and held its third meeting yesterday. Excerpts of the preliminary resolutions are recorded as follows: (1) The case of not increasing rents was sent to the municipal government for consideration. (2) The practice of cracking down on second landlords' extra demands and malpractices should be strictly prohibited by the municipal government, and the municipal government should formulate measures for conscientious implementation. (3) The construction of affordable housing was sent to the municipal government for consideration. (4) The housing lease dispute case will be jointly discussed with the tenth group's Legislative Committee. (5) The case of investigating and clarifying wasteland and public property in the urban area for utilization was not passed and should be resubmitted with a real estate management method for approval. (6) The original tenant of a house has the right of first refusal to lease, but the landlord may refuse to renew the lease if there is a violation of the regulations (the method will be announced after being passed by the general meeting). (7) Stopping the collection of defense corps uniform fees and exempting the book industry from business tax have been sent to the municipal government to be handled by the Finance Bureau. (8) Returning civilian land occupied by the enemy and puppets should be handled quickly and conscientiously by the municipal government. (9) Dividing shared land to avoid disputes should be handled by the Land Administration Bureau.</p>
<h3 id="e71">The Housing Lease Management Committee Has Numerous Malpractices in Arbitration; The Tenth Group's Review of Regulations Sparked FierCE Debate; Three Principles Were Decided: Arbitration Should Adopt a Collegial System <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>The tenth review committee was responsible for reviewing legislative proposals. The Housing Lease Management Committee regulations were discussed yesterday. The committee members present were Tao Baichuan, Ma Junshuo, Chen Cunren, Jiang Pingfan, Zhu Yakui, Yan Esheng, Zhu Fojiu, Wu Zhengxiao, Li Wenjie, Fan CaiKui, and Yu Chuanding. Zhu Ping, Director of the Land Administration Bureau, and Wu Zunyi, Chief Secretary of the Housing Lease Management Committee, were also present, ready to provide explanations at any time for reference during the review. Wu Zhengxiao, Zhu Yakui, and Yu Chuanding were the first to speak, pointing out that the internal structure of the Housing Lease Management Committee was too unsound, and there were numerous malpractices in arbitrating disputes. Moreover, after mediation by the committee, disputes not only could not be resolved, but also led to litigation. However, the courts did not pay attention to such civil lawsuits and often dragged on for six months or a year. In addition, the decisions of the Housing Lease Management Committee could not be enforced and were often overturned by the courts. Therefore, the committee has no credibility and is in name only. The parties involved in the dispute have great doubts about the fairness of the committee's decisions, so the committee should strengthen its organization to make itself sound. Senator Ma Junshuo continued to say: The Housing Lease Management Committee was established according to Article 23 of the Wartime Lease Regulations, but Article 24 of the regulations stated that the regulations would expire six months after the war. The committee has lost its legal basis, so the revision of the Housing Lease Management Regulations and the handling of dispute methods should be discussed carefully. Furthermore, the committee's rulings on housing disputes conflict with the courts. If the existence of this institution is still needed in the city, the legal aspect must be considered first, and it is recommended that the central government complete the legislative process in the future. Senator Ma also said that the committee's past mediation was too hasty, and it was done solely by the section chief or commissioner, resulting in many malpractices. If arbitration is still needed in the future, a collegial system must be adopted. Yan Esheng raised the question of whether the committee needs to continue to exist because it is a matter for administrative agencies. Therefore, Senator Tao Baichuan asked the third group, and learned that the third group's review opinion was that housing disputes can first be mediated by the district office, and if mediation fails, then the lease management committee will arbitrate. Senator Yan believed that since the third group had already decided this way, this case could be temporarily retained and decided after a joint review with the third group. Senator Ma believed that this was purely a legal basis issue, and the tenth group could not give up. Senator Zhu Fojiu said that the City Council has the right of initiative. If necessary, it can create a separate special law, and then, with the chairman's approval or through the legislative process, it can be applied with priority. Therefore, the first decision is whether it needs to exist. Senator Ma said that the nature of the city's separate laws belongs to orders, and orders must not conflict with central laws. Therefore, whether the committee continues to exist must first be determined by whether it has a legal basis and whether its rules and regulations conflict with the law. Senators Ma and Zhu quoted extensively and debated for a long time. Later, Director Zhu Ping stood up and stated that there are still many housing disputes in the city, and the committee is still needed in fact. If there is no problem with the abolition, the regulations can be discussed. Because it was late, three principles were set first, and other issues will be decided after a joint review and discussion with the third group. The three principles are (1) The mediation of the district office can be decided by the parties to the dispute themselves. (2) Arbitration shall adopt a five-person collegial system: one person from the municipal government, the court, and the police bureau, and two impartial local persons. The local impartial persons shall be proposed by the Mountain Council with a considerable number, and the chairman shall draw lots to decide two persons temporarily. (3) The revised draft shall be drafted by the Housing Lease Management Committee itself.</p>
<h3 id="e72">Regarding Police Security <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>The Second Review Committee. Yesterday afternoon, they reviewed proposals related to police security, dividing them into four major categories: 1. Volunteer police, self-defense forces, and security corps issues. 2. Firefighting work issues. 3. Issues related to improving police efficiency. 4. Matters that the police bureau should establish and implement. During the review of each proposal, Mr. Jiang Huaisu expressed the most opinions.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the city's victory, there was an original organization of security corps, but it was later abolished because the central government issued a clear order to abolish security corps in various places. All committee members believed that there was no need to restore it. As for the volunteer police, they were established in accordance with central laws and regulations to supplement the inadequacy of the police, which was definitely needed and should be strengthened. With winter defense approaching, the security work in the suburban security areas of the city is particularly important. To supplement the lack of police force, self-defense forces should be organized. This is a major focus of civil affairs work and has a legal basis. The committee members concluded that the security corps need not be restored, the volunteer police should be retained, and self-defense forces should be organized separately.</p>
<p>Firefighting work is related to the safety of citizens and should be strictly inspected. The ethics of firefighters is even more important and cannot be ignored. However, there is no firefighting item in this year's municipal budget. After a joint review by the committees, it was believed that the municipal government should be requested to stipulate a firefighting budget, strengthen firefighting equipment, and improve the work efficiency of firefighters.</p>
<p>Regarding the proposal to improve police efficiency, the review committee members believed that it is necessary to thoroughly eliminate the legacy of the former patrol rooms and establish a new police model. The police serve the people and should be polite to the common people. To improve the quality of police officers, it is stipulated that they must be junior high school graduates, and the treatment of police officers should be increased, with the lowest grade paid by appointment.</p>
<p>As for the matters that the police bureau should establish and reform, the most important and urgent matters are divided into three categories: investigating and banning private prostitutes and opium. Strengthening traffic control and eliminating pickpockets and petty thieves. All were approved in principle and the municipal government was requested to handle them separately.</p>
<h3 id="e73">Celebrating the Supreme Leader's Sixtieth Birthday; Mobilizing the Public to Prepare an Organization <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>The Seventh Review Committee. Yesterday, the review of proposals on social relief and labor was held, with a total of eleven people attending. Chairman Tang Shichang decided on the review method, and summarized all the proposals into fourteen categories. The conveners will prepare preliminary review opinions and submit them to the next review meeting for final decision. The proposal to prepare for the Chairman's Sixtieth Birthday celebration was also reviewed and passed. Because Speaker Pan and 39 others believe that since the Chairman launched the Northern Expedition, he has been working diligently day and night. This year coincides with the Chairman's sixtieth birthday, so they specially proposed to the Municipal Council to mobilize public groups to organize a preparatory committee to celebrate the Supreme Leader's sixtieth birthday and establish a permanent memorial to show respect for virtue and reward merit.</p>
<p>The fourteen categories of proposals are listed below: 1. Suppressing and stabilizing prices and rationing issues (4 items). 2. Labor-management issues (3 items). 3. Social welfare issues (1 item). 4. Relief issues (7 items). 5. Labor compulsory service (1 item). 6. Promoting the New Life Movement (3 items). 7. Farmers' welfare issues (2 items). 8. Cooperative enterprises (2 items). 9. Unemployment issues (3 items). 10. Women and children relief issues (4 items and 1 temporary motion). 11. Compensation for war losses and relief issues (1 item). 12. Labor welfare (9 items). 13. Implementation issues of the resolutions of the Provisional Council (2 items). 14. Petition from workers in the hotel industry (1 item).</p>
<h3 id="e74">A Solemn Appeal at the Council Meeting; Requesting the Recovery of Hong Kong, Kowloon, and Macau; The Owner of Hardoon Garden Has Agreed to Turn it into a Park <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>The last item on the agenda of the general meeting was to discuss several temporary motions.</p>
<p>Zhou Feicheng and more than 20 others jointly proposed that the municipal government contact the owner to lease Hardoon Garden and open it as a park for citizens to relax. The discussion concluded that because the Public Works Bureau had already contacted this matter and the owner had also expressed his consent, it was decided to hand it over to the Fifth Review Subcommittee for discussion.</p>
<p>The mayor submitted a proposal to extend daylight saving time to the end of October to save electricity, but the councilors strongly opposed it. The reason is that the time is near the Frost's Descent, and if daylight saving time is extended again, electricity may not be saved, but there will be many inconveniences for daily life and work. Feng Youzhen specifically mentioned the impact of daylight saving time on the morning newspaper publication time of the news industry. Finally, it was decided that this case would not be approved, and how to save electricity would be handed over to the Fifth Subcommittee for review.</p>
<p>The review of the municipal government's policy report was resolved to be jointly responsible by the conveners of each group.</p>
<p>The finale is often the most exciting. Wang Xianqing shouted out the call to "recover Hong Kong" in a solemn tone. He said: "Today there is a piece of news in the newspaper saying that the Hong Kong government spokesman does not recognize Kowloon City as Chinese territory. From Kowloon to Hong Kong, the phenomenon of Shanghai funds fleeing to Hong Kong is very serious. Recently, the Hong Kong dollar has risen, which has also stimulated the Shanghai market. Moreover, Hong Kong is a base for smuggling and tax evasion of foreign goods, which is an alarming economic loophole. Hong Kong residents are all Chinese citizens, and we should petition the national government to quickly negotiate and recover Hong Kong."</p>
<p>Councilors enthusiastically responded to his proposal and further mentioned another "tumor," Macau, and other places occupied such as Xinjiang, Mongolia, and Tibet, all of which should be recovered. Finally, the speaker summarized the opinions and decided to petition the national government to actively negotiate the recovery of Hong Kong, Kowloon, Macau, and other lands ceded or leased by unequal treaties, in order to benefit the integrity of the territory.</p>
<h3 id="e75">Preliminary Completion of the Review of Health Work <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>The Eighth Review Committee yesterday reviewed about 40 proposals related to the Health Bureau. More than 20 committee members attended, chaired by Pang Jingzhou. Because there were too many proposals and the content was mostly the same, in order to save time and facilitate review and discussion, they were first classified into three major categories: (1) related to hospitals, doctors, and public health; (2) related to fecal matter issues; (3) related to garbage removal and other issues. After all the proposals were read out by Councilor Pang, they were categorized according to their content. Therefore, the 40 proposals were cleared in less than an hour, and Councilors Fan Shouyuan, Chen Cunren, and Cen Zhiliang were publicly elected to be responsible for organizing and modifying the proposals (proposals with similar content were merged and the proposal title was changed), and compiling methods to facilitate discussion at the general meeting. The group's review work has now been initially completed.</p>
<h3 id="e76">Suggesting the Central Government Adopt a Cash Guarantee System <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>The Fourth Review Committee held its second meeting yesterday at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. The committee members Wang Xianqing, He Chengfu, Hong Fumei, Zhou Lianze, Huang Zhenshi, Yao Baozhen and others attended. The meeting was still chaired by Wang Xianqing. Two proposals were reviewed: The first proposal suggested that the central government abolish the current employee guarantee method and adopt the "Special Cash Guarantee System" that has been effectively tested by the Guangdong Provincial Bank, ordering government financial institutions to implement it as soon as possible in order to eliminate corruption cases and establish a sound guarantee system.</p>
<p>Wang Xianqing reported on the advantages of the cash guarantee system: (1) mutual supervision; (2) increasing savings; (3) due to the payment of the guarantee deposit, it has the effect of recovering legal currency; (4) it can also solve the difficulty of not being able to find a guarantor with a better reputation. Subsequently, other committee members expressed their opinions. The final review opinion was to submit it to the general meeting for approval. However, regarding the detailed methods and clauses of the system, it was proposed that Zhou Lianze conduct further research. The second proposal was the eight proposals submitted by the Municipal Chamber of Commerce in an official letter. The review opinion was to submit it to the general meeting for approval and recommend it to the Central Bank.</p>

<h3 id="e78">Solving Electricity Shortage; Planning to Purchase a Generator Ship <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>Shanghai Electric Power Company is currently consulting with relevant authorities to plan to order a generator ship from the United States to alleviate the current electricity shortage.

<p>[Our Newspaper] Football star Jia Youliang was previously accused of issuing bad checks for 30 million yuan, and the district court ruled that he should pay the plaintiff Zhu Xianghe according to the amount. Jia refused to accept the judgment and applied for a stay of execution, which was rejected. The district court held an execution hearing yesterday morning and summoned Jia Youliang for on-the-spot execution. Jia handed over three passbooks, each with a deposit of 10 million yuan. However, Jia's counter-suit against Zhu Xianghe will be heard in court on the 21st, so the money is temporarily stored in the court and will not be immediately handed over to Zhu Xianghe, pending a decision after the trial on the 21st.</p>

<h3 id="e81">Horse Racing Issue; Opinions Are Still; Three Three Two Two <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The horse racing proposal sparked a heated discussion again yesterday at the meeting of the Third Group Review Committee on Finance and Land Administration. Councilor Chen Cunren, who is familiar with the history of the racecourse, put forward three opinions: (1) Horse racing exists in any international metropolis and cannot be regarded as a kind of gambling, but it cannot be run in the most crowded area, and should be held in the suburbs; (2) Collecting taxes or ordering relocation according to the Land Law is costly, but the property rights of the racecourse are worth studying, so it is hoped that a problem research committee can be organized to study the racecourse clauses in detail and then make a decision; (3) The "Problem Research Committee" should use the method of the Greater Shanghai Bond Raising Research Committee as a reference and provide a separate recovery method for discussion by the next review committee. Later, Wang Jian'e raised a fundamental question. He said: "The Mayor's submission said that 'regarding horse racing, we must first ask whether it is purely horse racing or involves selling lottery tickets? If lottery tickets are sold, we can ask the municipal government to submit it to the Judicial Yuan to ask whether it is gambling according to Article 266 of the Criminal Law. If it conflicts with central laws and regulations, this case does not need to be discussed at all. ' "However, the opinions of the councilors were still mixed, and the more they discussed, the less clear they became. The scope was too large, and the result was still a decision to discuss it at the next review meeting.</p>

<h3 id="e83">Hangzhou's Major Theft Case Solved; Fang Zhengyuan is the Manager of the Pawnshop; The Victims are All Senior Officials and Celebrities <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Since last winter, no less than 20 "night theft" cases have occurred continuously in Hangzhou, but the targets of the thieves are all senior officials in the military and political circles, as well as lawyers and celebrities in the banking and business circles. For example, Shangguan Yunxiang, Deputy Commander of the Third War Zone Command, Xuan Tiewu's Hangzhou residence, Commander of the Songhu Garrison, Jin Runquan, President of the Bank of China, Chen Yanru, Councilor of the Third War Zone Command, Hu Xiwu, Director of the Investigation Office of the Zhejiang Provincial Security Command, lawyers Ye Wei, Zhao Jianxin, and others, all lost gold, silver, jewelry, coral, agate, gold watches, and diamond rings. Among them, Shangguan Yunxiang's residence was stolen of more than 4 million yuan in cash, and Commander Xuan's residence was stolen of sable coats, gray coats, fox coats, and coral Buddha hand jade bracelets. In addition, the Commercial Press, Shulianji Fan Shop, Baja Leather Shoe Store, Yanling Printing Factory, Hengsheng Paint Store, and Pan Wenbin, nephew of Division Commander Pan Guogang, Zhang Huchen, Technical Officer of the Public Works Bureau, Wang Sudan, etc., were all victims. Later, the Hangzhou Municipal Police Bureau arrested a receiver of stolen goods and seized ornaments and other items. According to the confession, the main culprit Fang Zhengyuan, the general manager of Shanghai Jifeng Pawnshop, was apprehended. According to Fang's confession, a part of the stolen goods was in his house at 314 Fuxing Middle Road in Shanghai. Therefore, the Hangzhou Police Bureau ordered Detective Ye Jianzhong to come to Shanghai with Fang under escort yesterday morning with official documents. Together with the police of the Taishan Branch, they secretly went to Fang's residence, arrested Fang's wife, Qiu (from Hubei, 36 years old), and his son, Guobin (19 years old), and seized a large suitcase of stolen goods such as "silver-clad gold" ornaments. It was then learned that another major criminal in the case was hiding at 52 Huangpi Road, so they went again and arrested Xiong Chuan and Zhang Xingwu (both from Hubei). The suspects and stolen goods were detained in the police station, awaiting escort back to Hangzhou for investigation.</p>
<h3 id="e84">US Military Tribunal Tries German War Criminals; No Infringement on Chinese Sovereignty; Prosecutor Sternly Refutes Defense Lawyer's Argument; Intense Dispute Over Whether to be Restricted by the German Surrender Instrument <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Yesterday, when the US military tribunal tried the German "Ehard Special Service Bureau" war criminals, defense lawyer Yang Linzhi launched a fierce attack in court, saying that the trial was illegal. Lawyer Yang said: Before the Judicial Yuan officially expresses its consent, even if there is an agreement between the US and Chinese governments, it cannot take effect. Therefore, the US military has no right to try these 23 German expatriates at all. He also claimed that, to his knowledge, the Judicial Yuan had never formally expressed its consent on this matter. Yang also cited the words of former US President Roosevelt, saying that the principle of trying war criminals should be that war criminals should be tried by the free government of the place where they committed the crime. Yang said: Germans had lost their consular jurisdiction in 1924 and had since been subject to Chinese law. However, Yang said that he did not object to the US military trying Japanese war criminals.</p>
<p>Lawyer Jiang Yiping, who defended defendant Baron Pugaman, also joined Yang's protest. After reciting the US military's regulations on the trial of war criminals one by one, he said that the defendant had not committed any of the items in these regulations.</p>
<p>German and Japanese are One and Indivisible</p>
<p>At this point, the chief prosecutor of the military tribunal, Major O'Connor, refuted, saying that the German expatriates protected by Chinese law refer to ordinary merchants and civilians, not those who come to China as enemies of China. He said that the defendants were all war criminals arrested in the war zone, which is different from ordinary criminals. O'Connor also said: The US military is stationed in China, having fulfilled its due obligations, and should also enjoy certain privileges. In response to Yang's claim that the US military came to China purely to defeat the Japanese army, O'Connor retorted that Germany and Japan were one and indivisible. The decision to try the defendants was originally to maintain world peace, that is, to ensure that there would be no third world war.</p>
<p>In response to Yang's claim that the trial of war criminals was an infringement of Chinese sovereignty and had aroused resentment among the Chinese people, O'Connor retorted that if the United States and China were to switch places, the United States would be very willing for Chinese military tribunals to try war criminals in the United States. The establishment of this US military tribunal was with the full consent of the Chinese government, and no protest from the Chinese government has been heard since the trial of Japanese war criminals. He said: If the Chinese army is also invited to the United States by the US government, as the Chinese government is doing to the US military now, if the Chinese troops stationed in the United States want to try war criminals, not only will it not arouse resentment from the American people, but it will definitely arouse the support of the American people.</p>
<p>Four Suspects Arrested in Peiping</p>
<p>O'Connor denied the claim of the defendant's defense lawyer that the US military was dissatisfied with the Chinese military tribunal, but said that he himself had heard that the Chinese military tribunal lacked talents, and suggested that Lawyer Yang, who is eloquent and eloquent, might as well show his talents in the Chinese military tribunal.</p>
<p>In response to Yang's claim that the defendants were overseas Chinese living in China and should be protected by Chinese law, O'Connor retorted that they were all enemies of the United States and China and could not be compared with ordinary overseas Chinese. Moreover, it was the puppet government presided over by Wang Jingwei who recognized them as official overseas Chinese.</p>
<p>Another defense attorney argued for the release of the defendants because they were not under the jurisdiction of the German Commander-in-Chief and therefore should not be restricted by the German instrument of surrender. The dispute was fierce, and it was not concluded until the adjournment. The hearing is scheduled to continue at 8:00 a.m. on Tuesday.</p>
<p>At the opening of the court yesterday, O'Connor announced that four more suspects in the case had been arrested in Beiping. They are currently detained in Chinese military institutions and will be transferred to justice soon.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper] Liang Shixun, a 24-year-old from Guangdong, does coal business. On the 5th of this month, he opened a room at No. 322 Yuandong Hotel on Tibet Road and met two Westerners. The two Westerners used the sale of radios as a reason to lure him in. Liang was fooled. At 11:00 p.m. on the 15th, he went to the room opened by the Westerners at No. 512 of the hotel, paid 500,000 in cash, and agreed to pay the remaining 100,000 on the 16th to take delivery of the goods. At 10:00 a.m. yesterday, Liang sent the remaining 100,000 yuan to the Westerners because the appointment had expired. After one of the Westerners received the money, he falsely claimed that he would go to Hongkou to pick up the goods together. When they arrived at the entrance of a lane on Wuchang Road, the Westerner asked him to wait a moment. After more than an hour, he did not see him return. Liang knew he had been deceived and rushed back to report the situation to the Laozha Branch, requesting investigation. The police bureau learned that the two Westerners were indeed unemployed vagrants who lived by fraud. They are now being strictly arrested and brought to justice.</p>

<h3 id="e89">Severe Sentence in the Case of Chopping Husband and Dismembering Body: Zhan Zhou Still Sentenced to Death · The Defendant's Only Defense Was Lack of Premeditation · High Court Opened Trial Yesterday Afternoon and Concluded in One Hearing · <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The sensational Jiangyuan Lane blood case in Shanghai during the enemy-puppet period – Zhan Zhou chopped her husband Zhan Yunying, and afterwards dismembered the body into sixteen pieces, packed them into a box, and attempted to destroy the evidence. The crime was discovered by the second landlord, Wang Xieyang, who reported it to the police. The female criminal Zhan Zhou was sentenced to death by the puppet court at the time. (Photo of Zhan Zhou taken by China Press during the hearing) The defendant refused to accept the sentence and was appealing to the puppet supreme court. Victory came, and the judgment was declared invalid, so the Municipal High Procuratorate re-investigated and prosecuted. Yesterday at 2:30 PM, the trial opened at the High Court on North Zhejiang Road, and it was concluded in one hearing. The defendant was immediately sentenced to death again.</p>
<p>(Before the Trial) Zhan Zhou submitted a petition to the High Court, requesting the revocation of the original judgment of the pseudo-first instance and a reduced sentence in accordance with Articles 273, 249, and 57 of the Criminal Law. The appeal was drafted by pro bono defense lawyers Chen Xia and Shi Baixiu, and the main points, facts, and reasons for the appeal are as follows.</p>
<p>(Main Points): The occurrence of this case was out of righteous indignation. It was a temporary motive in a state of confusion, without deep thought or premeditation. The original trial mistakenly regarded the purchase of a kitchen knife as definite proof of premeditation. The dismemberment was a cruel act. The severe sentence of death is difficult to accept.</p>
<p>(Facts): After marrying Zhan Yunying, although he was violent and quarrelsome, she could still endure it. Since the fall of Shanghai, he became addicted to gambling and neglected his proper business. He also opened an escort agency, colluding with the enemy and puppets day and night, enticing respectable men and women, and harming public morals. He refused to care for the family's livelihood, returning home once or twice a month, always after midnight (with enemy-puppet passes), and sweeping away pledges whenever he left. Any slight persuasion would result in violent beatings. In October of the 33rd year [of the Republic], feeling that life was meaningless, she swallowed Lysol and attempted suicide to end her life. Fortunately, she was discovered by a female tenant living on the terrace and rushed to Hongren Hospital on Xinzha Road for emergency treatment and survived. Ten days later, she was discharged from the hospital. Although her husband knew this, he did not show any compassion and abandoned her as before, making life even more difficult. She invited neighbors to gather and help fund her efforts, selling stewed pork and other items on the street to make ends meet. So, she bought a kitchen knife, cutting board, and bamboo basket, intending to start a business. However, her husband found out when he returned home at night and stole the working capital, causing her plans to fail. She then earned a living by embroidering and sewing for others. On the morning of March 20 of the 34th year [of the Republic], her husband returned at 3 AM. They argued and fought for about two hours, then fell asleep from exhaustion. She awoke from a nightmare at dawn. After urinating in a daze, she saw a kitchen knife nearby. Suddenly, she felt that her husband was harming the country and the people, so she acted on impulse and cut off his head. Realizing the enormity of her crime, she dismembered the body and packed it into a box, intending to carry it out and discard it. However, she sat blankly on the bed, unsure of what to do. The second landlord, Wang Xieyang, saw blood flowing downstairs, discovered the crime, and reported it to the police. This is the fact of the case.</p>
<p>(Reasons): The appellant’s husband opened an escort agency and colluded with the enemy and puppets, harming the country and the people. It was a temporary act of righteous indignation and intolerable provocation that led to the murder of her husband. Although the law is unforgiving, the circumstances are pitiable. According to Article 284, Section 1, Item 1 of the old Criminal Law, premeditation is required to constitute the crime of murder. Therefore, the act of killing must be based on the result of deep deliberation, and there must be a definite plan before implementation. If the intent to kill is decided on the spur of the moment, even if there is a long-standing feud, it is only a distant cause of the intent to kill and cannot be equated with intentional homicide. Therefore, it is inappropriate to impose the penalty for murder (see Precedent No. 2097, Shang Zi, 21st Year). This case was indeed a temporary decision, without any premeditation. The original judgment was based solely on conjecture to create a case of premeditated murder, which is not in accordance with legal principles. Furthermore, the dismemberment was to destroy evidence and cannot be compared to cruel acts such as heart-ripping or abdominal incision. Therefore, it only constitutes the crime under Article 249, Section 1, and Article 273 of the Criminal Law. The motive and purpose of the crime were decided on the spur of the moment, without deep deliberation or premeditation. The repeated provocations suffered by the appellant were intolerable for a weak woman, causing her to react impulsively. There was no other deliberate intention. Her difficult living conditions and lack of education are all in accordance with the provisions of Article 57 of the Criminal Law for mitigation. She humbly requests that she be granted leniency and a lighter sentence, which would be a great act of kindness.</p>
<p>(Zhou) is currently detained in the Women's Prison of the Shanghai Prison in Tilanqiao. Before the court session yesterday, she was specially brought to the High Court on North Zhejiang Road, wearing a blue cloth short shirt and trousers prisoner's uniform, with a white number [226] embroidered on her chest, and gray cloth closed-toe shoes on her bare feet. Her original long hair had been cut to ear length. She was short and had a pale face. At that time, the courtroom was crowded with spectators, mostly housewives. At 2:30 PM, Judge Zhang Qinglan, along with Judges Wang Kequan and Zhu Chengzan, Prosecutor Jiang Gongliang, and clerks, arrived and took their seats. They immediately ordered the bailiffs to bring up Zhan Zhou. They first asked her age, native place, and address. She replied: 31 years old, Danyang native, residing at No. 85, Lane 432, Xinchang Road, Jiangyuan Lane. After the prosecutor read out the indictment, the questioning began. Judge: Did you kill your husband at 3 AM on the night of March 20, 34th year? Answer: It was at dawn. I suddenly woke up and got up to urinate. I saw a knife in the drawer of a small cabinet next to the toilet, and I took the knife and killed him. Judge: Was your husband asleep or awake at this time? Answer: Awake. Judge: Was he sleeping facing in, facing out, on his back, or on his stomach? Answer: I don't remember clearly. Judge: Where was the first cut? Answer: I don't know. I was confused at this time and didn't know anything. Judge: Did your husband shout when you killed him? Answer: Sir, I don't know if he shouted or not. I was confused. Judge: Why did you kill your husband? Answer: It wasn't premeditated. It was a matter of the moment. He was usually bad-tempered. He ate, whored, gambled, and often ran the escort agency. If I asked him for living expenses, he would beat me. We were married for nine years without any affection.</p>
<p>(In Court) Judge: Then you could have divorced? Answer: I don't understand the law. My husband helped others say that he wouldn't give me living expenses and would let me have affairs, so he wouldn't have to pay me alimony when we divorced. Judge: Why did you chop him into sixteen pieces? Answer: After I killed him, it seemed like someone was telling me in my ear to chop him up, chop him up. Judge: Have you read "Ling Kong Shu"? Answer: No. Judge: Who else is in your family? Answer: No one. Judge: No one on your mother's side? Answer: No one on my mother's side, and no relatives on Zhan's side either. The judge then asked: Do you have a relationship with Little Ningbo? Answer: No, not at all. Judge: Why did you admit it before? Answer: I was forced to confess by torture at the police station. I had no choice and couldn't make my own decisions. Judge: You previously confessed that Little Ningbo gave you money to buy the kitchen knife? Answer: No. Judge: Did Little Ningbo tell you to kill him? Answer: He never said that. Judge: How could you, alone, kill Zhan Yunying, such a tall man? Answer: My soul wasn't in my body. I was possessed. When I killed him, I didn't treat him like a person, but like killing something else. Judge: Was the light on when you killed him? Answer: No. Judge: Did you have an affair with He Damazi, who lived in the front building? Answer: No affair, just some money. The judge immediately asked: Why are you now reversing all your previous confessions? Answer: I've always said this. Judge: Did He Damazi help you when you killed him? Answer: No. Judge: Then why did he run away afterwards? Answer: Someone from the countryside asked him to bring pancakes back, so he went back to the countryside.</p>
<p>(The Questioning) ended here. The presiding judge asked Zhou: Answer: Please, sir, I didn't do it intentionally. I was really confused for a moment, possessed. Please, sir, grant me a chance to live. Then the debate began, first with the prosecutor's argument, followed by the defense lawyer's response. (The reasons are detailed in the appeal). The presiding judge announced the end of the debate and waited for the court to deliberate before announcing the verdict on the spot. It was 3:05 PM. The defendant was temporarily taken away. The spectators discussed the matter animatedly, and the atmosphere was very tense. At 3:12 PM, the judges returned to the court and brought up the defendant. The presiding judge stood up and read the main text of the judgment: Zhan Zhou is sentenced to death for murder, deprived of public rights for life, and the kitchen knife is confiscated. The defendant wanted to argue more after hearing the verdict, repeatedly saying "not intentional." The court waved to stop her and told her that if she did not accept the verdict, she could apply for review to the Supreme Court in Nanjing within ten days after receiving the verdict. The defendant was then taken away by the bailiffs and detained.</p>
<p>It is noted that American lawyer Courtenay and several Japanese lawyers were retained on behalf of the defendant at this trial.</p>

<p>[City News] The Foreign Correspondents' Club of China yesterday telegraphed U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes and Wu Dingchang, Director of the Bureau of Civil Affairs of the Chinese National Government, to strongly protest the Chinese court's acceptance of the case of Shen Ke, a national of a former enemy state currently being tried for war crimes, against Maitland, manager of the United Press China bureau, for defamation. The telegram to Byrnes was signed by twenty-five British and American correspondents, requesting the U.S. government to advise the Chinese government to oppose the acceptance of this case. The telegram to Director Wu Dingchang urged him to [fully consider the significant implications of the case], because foreign journalists believe that this case seriously damages freedom of the press and threatens their safety and personal freedom, and requested [revocation based on appropriate Chinese legal procedures]. Both telegrams pointed out that Shen Ke accused Maitland of defaming him in his news reports by stating that he was a Nazi spy, but in fact, these reports were based on official announcements from the U.S. military authorities. The foreign correspondents pointed out that Shen Ke has been deemed a [despicable] Nazi, and the Chinese government has decided to deport him. Legal authorities say that in this situation, he should have been deprived of his public rights long ago.</p>

<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The High Court yesterday sentenced the four suspected traitors: Zhang Yifeng was sentenced to four years imprisonment, Chou Shuxian to three years, Xu Shengyang to two years and six months, and Qi Huichang to one year and six months. All property will be confiscated, except for what is deemed necessary for the living expenses of their families.</p>
<p>On the same day, the cases of Sun Zuji, the former mayor of the puppet Hangzhou government, and Liu Zhenqun, the former specialist of the secretariat of the puppet Central Political Committee, were concluded. The verdicts will be announced on the 23rd.</p>

<p>Xue Gengxin, the former inspector-general of the Municipal French Concession Police, colluded with the enemy and puppets during the occupation and arrested our underground comrades. After the victory, he fled to North China and was captured by the authorities and escorted to Shanghai. The High Procuratorate investigated and prosecuted him. Xue is currently 36 years old and a native of Shanghai. The indictment states that the defendant was formerly a translator in the Malong Squad of the French Concession Police and was promoted to inspector-general after the war of resistance. He colluded with Sheng You to transport opium and used the [Malong Squad] to help the enemy arrest our underground comrades. On August 1, 32nd year [of the Republic], the puppet government took back the Shanghai concessions, and the defendant served as inspector-general and chief of the economic section of the puppet Third Police Bureau, then rose to become chief of the Meilan District Branch Bureau, deputy chief of the Huangpu Branch Bureau, and deputy director of the Special High Department of the puppet Police General Bureau. He also used the name of the Japanese Goto, director of the Special High Department, to forcibly purchase materials from various manufacturers at low prices and sell them on the black market for profit. According to reports from Qi Zaiyu and others, secret workers of the Military Intelligence Bureau in Shanghai, in the 29th year [of the Republic], the Shanghai West Special Operations organization lacked henchmen in the French Concession, so they won over the defendant and paid him a stipend. He also fought with Police Inspector Li to establish the Criminal Eighth Station to assist the enemy and puppets in arresting our underground comrades. The case was adjourned for further hearing.</p>
<p>Zhao Riliang, a translator for the Special High Department of the puppet police bureau, was originally sentenced to eight years. The defendant appealed, and the case was remanded for retrial. The court opened the retrial yesterday afternoon for further investigation. The case of Chen Jiu, the former chief secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Baojia Preparatory Committee, was investigated yesterday, and Cheng Zhiliang and others were called as witnesses for questioning. The case of Zhang Yunfang, chairman of the Shanghai Hardware Industry Association, was continued for further hearing because the defendant himself did not appear.</p>

<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Due to the lack of public transportation in the city and the high prices of rickshaws, large trucks carrying passengers have emerged, stopping at fixed locations and soliciting business, especially in the Hongkou and Zhabei areas. The fares are very cheap, with the highest fare being only 500 yuan. After the trend of trucks carrying passengers became popular, it not only hindered traffic but also violated the Public Works Bureau's automobile management regulations. The rickshaw business has also been severely affected. Now, in order to maintain their livelihood, they have submitted a petition to the Police Bureau yesterday, requesting a crackdown. It is said that the Police Bureau has ordered all branches to implement it starting today.</p>
<h3 id="e94">Bathhouse Labor Dispute Rages · Dozens of Businesses Vandalized <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Although the bathhouse labor-management dispute was mediated by the authorities, the veteran workers did not accept it. After the vandalism that occurred at the Xinquan Pool on Fuxing Middle Road the night before last, dozens of bathhouses, both large and small, were vandalized yesterday afternoon throughout the city. In the central district, such as Grand View Garden, Anle Pool, and Paradise, there were also incidents in the Nanshi and Zhabei areas. The veteran workers rushed into the bathhouses in batches, posted slogans, and forced the new employees to stop working. Those who resisted were beaten, and glass windows, tables, and chairs were destroyed, resulting in heavy losses. It is said that in several locations, the district police arrested several perpetrators and took them to the bureau for interrogation.</p>
<h3 id="e95">· Visiting Engineering Facilities in the Second District · Two Major Scenic Spots Restored to Their Former Glory · Longhua Pagoda and City God Temple Have a New Look · Two Hundred Stalls Will Rent Space at Small World to Operate <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>[Special Report from Our Newspaper] At 2:00 PM yesterday, the reporter followed Wu Wenhua, director of the Second District Engineering Management Office of the Municipal Public Works Bureau, Specialist Qian Weifan, Engineer Xu Dexian, and others to visit the engineering facilities in the Second District. In order to achieve division of labor, cooperation, and greater efficiency, the Public Works Bureau divided the engineering facilities into six districts. The so-called Second District includes most of the area east of the former French Concession's Zhengzhong South Road, the entire old walled city of Nanshi, along Xujiahui Road to Caohejing, Minhang, and other places, and also manages the entire Pudong area. We boarded a large truck from the Public Works Bureau and departed from the YMCA in Baxianqiao, to Longhua, then to Nanshi, visited the City God Temple, and then returned to our original route.</p>
<p>Remembering Jinji Road: Greatest Contribution</p>
<p>The characteristic of the Second District of the Public Works Bureau is that it possesses two historical scenic spots – Longhua Pagoda and the City God Temple. Both of these major sites were broken and incomplete during the eight years of war, with a desolate appearance! In the past year, with the full cooperation of the citizens and the authorities, most of them have been restored. The clay Bodhisattvas in the temples are painted brightly, and from the top of the Longhua Pagoda, you can overlook the iron birds rising and falling in the airport. These were all automatically raised funds by the local leaders to repair them. It is believed that more pious men and women will come to the temple next spring to burn incense. The greatest contribution of the Second District of the Public Works Bureau here is the widening of Jinji Road – the only avenue from the city center to Longhua – by one meter on each side. In the future, the crowded conditions on this road during the incense season will definitely be greatly improved.</p>
<p>Lotus Pond – Removing Silt</p>
<p>After visiting Longhua Pagoda, we turned to the City God Temple. The City God Temple is a commercial and recreational center, constantly handling a large number of tourists throughout the years. The destruction it suffered during the long war was even more severe, with many buildings collapsing and burning. The reconstruction of the City God Temple after the recovery was initiated by local people. After the Public Works Bureau agreed, a reorganization committee was organized, and all expenses were jointly funded by the citizens and the government. Now, it is all completed. The largest project was the removal of silt from the Lotus Pond of the City God Temple. People who have visited the City God Temple know that the Lotus Pond under the Nine-Bend Bridge has always been used by old Buddhist ladies as a release pond. It was originally a stagnant pool, and it is unknown how many years had passed. Tourists continuously threw garbage into the river, so it had long been foul-smelling.</p>
<p>Catching Turtles – Open Secret</p>
<p>The Public Works Bureau believed that this pool of sewage not only detracted from the view but also directly affected the health of countless people. Therefore, in May of this year, it thoroughly replaced this pool of ten thousand gallons of sewage! The fire brigade was responsible for the pumping project. It is said that when the water was drained, in addition to a small number of fish, there were countless turtles of all sizes left on the silt. The people who sold turtles inevitably took the opportunity to catch them. In fact, the people who caught the turtles must also be the people who sold the turtles. It is unknown what those who specialize in releasing animals to cultivate virtue think of this open secret?</p>
<p>Small World – Splendid</p>
<p>In addition, the Small World near the City God Temple was instantly turned into a rubble field by a wildfire during the war. Now, under the auspices of Huang Jinrong, Zong Cailiang, and others, a new Small World has been built, which is taller and more solid than the old one, and includes cinemas, cafes, open-air dance halls, storytelling houses, and other entertainment venues. According to Mr. Zong: The vacant second floor has been decided to be rented to vendors from the Zhubaoshan Road area, accommodating a total of two hundred stalls, all equipped with glass counters. The contract has now been signed, and the lessee, Datong Company, will receive a net income of 3 million yuan per month, which will be shared equally by the two hundred vendors. After the installation is completed, it will be open for business soon. Once the vendors are revived there, Small World will become the commercial and entertainment center of Nanshi, which is beyond doubt.</p>
<p>After this visit, the reporter deeply felt that Longhua Temple and the City God Temple, the two major scenic spots in the city, have indeed been restored. However, it is not enough to rely solely on the restoration of these two places. Moreover, what China needs after the revival is not just restoration, but creation!</p>
<h3 id="e96">Appendectomy Without Anesthesia · Forced to Stand at Attention for Ten Consecutive Days · Allied Prisoners of War Suffered Torture · Japanese War Criminal Kawashima Sentenced to Hanging · Matsuda Sentenced to Seven Years of Labor · <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Kawashima, a medical officer at the Shenyang Forward Military Prisoner-of-War Camp, was sentenced to hanging by the U.S. Military Tribunal in this city for his confirmed atrocities against Allied prisoners of war. Matsuda, the director of the camp, was sentenced to seven years of labor for beating American prisoners of war and for failing to prevent the deaths of three American prisoners of war who were sentenced to death for attempting to escape during his tenure. Many Allied soldiers, heroes of the Battle of Bataan, were unfortunately captured due to the disparity in numbers and were detained in this concentration camp. When Prosecutor Major Fowler read out the depositions, he mentioned the testimony of General Wainwright, a hero of Bataan, who denied the rumors of any communication with Matsuda. Another witness was American medic Humberstone, who stated that according to Matsuda's orders, Japanese soldiers gave prisoners of war with severe pneumonia only three centimeters of thiamine powder per day, and even this small amount was withheld when the prisoners' temperature dropped slightly. American Sergeant Cole was suffering from appendicitis when he was arrested, and Kawashima deliberately delayed his treatment. Only when his appendix ruptured did he allow him to enter the hospital for surgery. In 1944, Kawashima refused to isolate patients with mumps from their companions, resulting in the infection of one-third of the prisoners of war. Sergeant Cole's testimony was particularly tragic. He wrote that he was sent to the hospital for surgery three days after suffering from appendicitis. At that time, the anesthetic had been used up, so he had to undergo the English surgery while fully conscious. Occasionally, when he groaned or cried out in pain, Kawashima would hit him on the head and shout, "No noise!" After the surgery was completed, Kawashima ordered him to get up from the operating table and walk to the bed himself. Kawashima had two nicknames in the concentration camp, one was "Butcher" and the other was "No Noise".</p>
<p>Sergeant Reynerson testified that one day, when the prisoners of war returned to the camp after labor, Kawashima ordered the sick to step forward. About eight or nine people responded, most of whom suffered from frostbite, with their toes frozen to a purplish-black color. Kawashima ordered them to take off their shoes and socks and stand on the ice. At that time, the weather was already twenty-one degrees below zero. Kawashima severely reprimanded them, saying that there was no such thing as "frostbite" in the world, and then allowed them to leave.</p>
<p>Another American sergeant, Lai, testified that he had witnessed Matsuda's assistant, Miki, beat four prisoners of war with a wooden stick three feet long and half an inch thick. He said that Miki severely beat these four people on the head below the ears, and they often fell to the ground after being hit. He continued to beat them until they could not move, and said that this was one way to educate the American army. He said that the American army was like beasts and should be treated like beasts. Miki claimed to be 30 years old and a graduate of the Economics Department of Tokyo Imperial University. He admitted to insulting about ten to fifteen American soldiers. He has now been sentenced to twenty years of hard labor.</p>
<p>Miki mentioned the execution of the three American prisoners who attempted to escape: The execution was carried out on July 13, 1943. They were first blindfolded, then their arms were stretched out on a wooden cross, and they were ordered to sit down with their legs crossed. From seven or eight meters away, the Japanese gunmen knelt down and aimed at them, one shooting the head and one shooting the chest, firing one shot at a time for fun.</p>
<p>Another American lieutenant proved that he had witnessed a Japanese officer grinding the face of an American sailor with the heel of his leather shoe. Another American prisoner of war was ordered to stand at attention for ten consecutive days, during which he was only allowed to sleep for ten hours.</p>
<p>It is noted that American lawyer Courtenay and several Japanese lawyers were retained on behalf of the defendant at this trial.</p>

<h3 id="e101">Ministry of Education Issues Nationwide Order Promoting National Education and Limiting Fees <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing News] In order to popularize national education, after the Ministry of Education promulgated the Second Five-Year Implementation Plan this year, it is urgently necessary to conduct a thorough investigation of whether various provinces and cities have increased the number of central national schools and Bao national schools in accordance with the plan and to seek promotion. The Ministry of Education is promoting the popularization of national education on the one hand, and taking care of poor students on the other hand. Moreover, national education is compulsory education and should not be charged. Therefore, a special order is issued nationwide to limit fees, so that families in difficult circumstances can easily enroll. All of these must be observed from the field and promoted and improved. Tang Deyuan, a member of the National Education Guidance Committee, has been sent to inspect the current status of the implementation of national education in the recovery of education in the provinces and cities of North China. Tang has already set off on an inspection tour. The extent to which national education has progressed in the cities of Beijing and Shanghai and other provinces and cities will also be followed up with the dispatch of personnel for inspection. Furthermore, since the provinces and cities have greatly increased the number of Bao national schools in accordance with the Five-Year Implementation Plan for National Education, a large number of teachers are needed. The Ministry of Education has taken this into account in the Educational Administrative Plan for the thirty-sixth year, and has given flexibility to provinces and cities that cultivate teachers for the promotion of national education. For example, in cases where teachers are urgently needed, short-term teacher training can be carried out according to the actual situation, and even a one-year simple teacher training program is not impossible. For the current emergency, the method of using substitute teachers can be adopted, and the standards can be raised and training increased at an appropriate time. Because national education originally had a stage of four years of primary school and two years of senior primary school, simple teachers can teach those with four years of education in Bao schools, it is said.</p>

<h3 id="e104">Students from Six Major Universities Request Distribution from the Ministry of Education; Minister Zhu Refuses <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing News, 16th] More than 30 representatives of returning students from six universities, including Chongqing University, went to the Ministry of Education at 10:30 a.m. on the 16th to petition. They were first received by Chief Secretary Huo Huan, but the talks yielded no results. Around 12:00 p.m., Minister Zhu came out to meet them and said that the distribution they requested had not been explicitly approved by the ministry and was not in accordance with the regulations, so it was difficult to do. He also rebuked the students for not making noise in the office and then left in a hurry. The students, unable to obtain results, waited on empty stomachs, firmly requesting an opportunity to speak. At about 4:00 p.m., Vice Minister Hang came out and explained four points to the students: (1) The students' petition in Chongqing was to ask for assistance in returning home, which the Ministry of Education has done. (2) Students from National Lin University and National Middle School have no schools to attend, while the students' situation is different. (3) Director He Shijun went to Shanghai to negotiate with the top ten universities for transfer exams and has achieved satisfactory results, and everyone can be accommodated as much as possible, so the students should not be afraid of taking the exams. (4) Director Zhou Hongjing will discuss the transfer exam methods for the Nanjing area with the presidents of various universities on the 22nd. The distribution is really difficult to do. After Hang finished speaking, he also left. The students continued to have earnest talks with Zhai Hezhou and others, but there were still no results. They did not leave the ministry until 5:00 p.m. According to them, the purpose of today's petition was to hear opinions, because they had no opportunity to speak until the end.</p>

<h3 id="e106">Hao Gengsheng's Report on Inspection of the Northeast: Students' Meals Lack Oil, Only Boiled Salted Soybeans as Accompaniment; Teachers Have Not Received Salaries, Voluntarily Teaching for Four Months <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing News] Hao Gengsheng, an inspector appointed by the Ministry of Education, submitted a report to the Ministry of Education on the inspection of education in the Northeast. A brief account was published in this newspaper yesterday. His inspection reports on Northeast China University, Changchun University, and Jilin University have also been submitted to the Ministry. A more detailed account is now published below:</p>
<p>Sale of Enemy and Puppet Property Reaches 500 Million</p>
<p>(1) Preparatory Office of the Private Northeast China University: The school will set up five colleges of Liberal Arts, Law, Science, Engineering, and Agriculture. The Colleges of Liberal Arts and Law will use the former Xingya Hall, which has spacious buildings. The Colleges of Science and Engineering will use the old site of the former Fengtian Industrial University in Tiexi (the Japanese spent 1.5 million yen to build the school), with buildings covering an area of more than 13,000 square meters. Among them, the main equipment has been transported away, and there is still a part of the remaining equipment that can be used. The College of Agriculture is located on Siping Street, which was originally a Japanese farm with a large scale. Regarding the funds, the proceeds from the sale of enemy and puppet property reached 500 million [currency unit unclear] in currency. The school's application for record filing is being actively processed. An official document has already been submitted to the ministry. At the same time, Du Yuming, the chairman of the school's board of directors, has sent a special letter to the minister explaining everything.</p>
<p>Palace-Style Construction with Heating Equipment</p>
<p>(2) Changchun University, which is about to be established: The school plans to set up five colleges of Liberal Arts, Law, Science, Engineering, and Agriculture. The College of Agriculture was originally the site of the Jian Country University of the puppet Manchukuo. The Jian Country University was directly under the puppet Manchukuo State Council, and the students were mostly civil servants undergoing training. The buildings are mostly palace-style, and the auditorium can accommodate at least 3,000 people. The floor is damaged, the seats are empty, and the heating equipment is still intact. Not far from the school is a Jian Country Martyrs' Shrine, which is entirely palace-style and beautifully constructed. Although some of the buildings have bullet marks, the building itself is generally undamaged. The scale of this temple is grand and can be used by Changchun University, but it is still under consideration and has not yet been determined. The Colleges of Liberal Arts and Law are located in the former puppet Ministry of Education. The equipment is incomplete, and the buildings are not greatly damaged. They can be used after repairing the doors and windows. The College of Engineering will use the former Xinjing Industrial University, which has not been much damaged and is currently occupied by the military. The College of Medicine was originally the Xinjing Medical University, with all of its equipment intact. The spirit of the students and nurses is excellent. In the past, almost all of the professors were Japanese. Currently, Guo Songgen from Taiwan is working hard to maintain the school. He has been temporarily appointed as acting president by Special Envoy Zang to maintain the school's affairs. Adjustments will be made after the preparatory personnel of Changchun University arrive. There are currently 186 students. The class situation at the college is very good. To prevent cholera, students have given lectures and administered injections on the streets, and their service spirit is excellent. Among the students in Changchun who plan to enter Changchun University, 800 to 900 are from Shenyang, and nearly 1,000 are from Harbin and other places. The students and school buildings of the school do not seem to be a problem. The key is to have someone in charge to prepare for the opening of school as soon as possible. Gengsheng urged Director Huang in Beiping to go there on a fixed date, and it is said that he set off for Changchun on August 10th.</p>
<p>Sturdy Glass Windows Burned into Wavy Shapes</p>
<p>(3) Chinese Academy of Sciences: During the puppet Manchukuo period, the academy was the center for the Japanese to develop the rich resources of the Northeast and promote the expansion of its industrial national defense technology research. Although the scale of the scientific research institution is not very large, it includes many departments. After August 15th, some of the equipment was looted unsuccessfully and destroyed by burning. Although the library had fire prevention equipment, gasoline flames turned the books on the bookshelves to ashes, and the sturdy glass windows were burned into wavy shapes, which shows the intensity of the burning. The academy is now taken over by the Ministry of Economic Affairs. According to the academic research system, it seems that the Central Research Institute should continue to run it.</p>
<p>Local People Disappointed that Jilin University Will Not Be Restored</p>
<p>(4) Jilin University Tutorial Classes are located at the old site of the former Jilin University. Jilin University was completed before September 18th. Its predecessor was the Higher Normal School in the 25th year of the Republic of China. In the 27th year, the Japanese changed it to the Shidao Higher School, and in the 31st year, it was changed to the Shidao University. At that time, there were more than 1,700 students. After August 15th, troops were stationed there, and students and faculty members spontaneously organized to protect the school, so the damage to the school property was limited, and the loss was minimal (troops had been stationed there seven times in the past). There are currently 25 faculty members (14 staff members) and 353 students, including 59 female students. There are 25 faculty residences, which can accommodate 40 families. There are more than 30,000 books. The chemical instruments were damaged, but fortunately the total loss is less than 25%. Currently, remedial classes are being offered. The funds are raised by the faculty and students of the school from all parties. After Gengsheng and Special Envoy Zang inspected the school, the Special Envoy's Office agreed to allocate a subsidy of 450,000 [currency unit unclear] per month. The students of the school live a hard life, and their meals lack oil, so they only cook salted soybeans as a side dish. Since August 15th, the teachers have not received their salaries and have been voluntarily teaching for nearly four months. The school buildings are suitable for use as a normal school. Local people in Jilin are very enthusiastic about restoring the original Jilin University. Chairman Liang once gathered local people and explained to Gengsheng the reasons for restoring Jilin University as follows: (1) The provincial government has long paid attention to this matter and resolved at the provincial government committee meeting to restore Jilin University as soon as possible. (2) Restoring Jilin University is restoring an old school, not establishing a new one. (3) Changchun University is located too far west, not as suitable as Yongji. (4) Yongji has beautiful mountains and rivers and a higher cultural level, so it is hoped that there will be a university. (5) If limited to the regulations of the government school name, using the place name instead of the province name, then Yongji is the location of Jilin City and can still be called Jilin University. (6) Zhang Zuoxiang once used his own strength to run a university, but today the central government is not restoring it, which really disappoints the local people. When Gengsheng left Shenyang and Beiping, Chairman Han of Heilongjiang Province, Chairman Wu of Hejiang Province, and the heads of the education and finance departments of the two provinces also repeatedly requested to forward the request to restore Jilin University in a timely manner.</p>
<p>30,000 Artifacts Looted One After Another</p>
<p>(5) Museum: Originally Tang Yulin's residence, it was converted into a museum by the Japanese after September 18th. Currently, the Special Envoy's Office of the headquarters is also located here. However, most of the upper floor is occupied by the military's Special Envoy's Office and has not yet been read out. There are five ancient relic storage rooms inside. There were originally 37,803 ancient relics, which were looted one after another. For example, the Buddha statues in the Rehe Imperial Palace that could not be taken away were destroyed. What remains are only inscriptions and stone carvings. The Northeast Cultural Relics Preservation Committee is now preparing to be established to sort out the lost relics. It is planned to appoint Mr. Jin Yuzhan as the director to be responsible for the work.</p>
<p>Former Stable Wen Su Ge Has Many Ming Dynasty Archives</p>
<p>(6) (Thirteen) Library: The library is located in the old palace, formerly known as Wen Su Ge. It stores the Complete Library of the Four Branches of Literature, including 9,071 volumes of the Zibu, 12,265 volumes of the Jibu, 9,408 volumes of the History Department, 5,509 volumes of the Classics Department, and 5,020 volumes of the Palace Edition of the Illustrated Compendium of Books. In addition, there are 127 volumes of the Palace Edition of the General Catalogue of the Complete Library of the Four Branches of Literature and 72 volumes of the Textual Research of the Complete Library of the Four Branches of Literature. In addition to the 41,273 volumes of the Complete Library of the Four Branches of Literature, there are 150,000 other books. The library contains many archives from the Ming Dynasty, and there is also an extremely valuable book by the Japanese Shimayo, which is also stored in the library. Shimayo originally wanted to sell it, and we are willing to keep it for use. This issue has not yet been resolved. The Wen Su Ge library has solid construction and is fireproof. The bookshelves are all made of steel, and the doors and windows are covered with iron sheets to ensure safety.</p>
<p>Feng Yong University Temporarily Not Planning to Restore</p>
<p>(7) In addition, according to President Feng himself, Shenyang Private Feng Yong University is not planning to restore this year because the school's property cannot be recovered and the source of funds has been cut off. Due to factual difficulties, I was unable to visit the above-mentioned schools in Harbin, but the general situation can be known from the process of Mayor Yang's filing of the Harbin Maintaining Education Ministry's Directly-Managed University. All adjustments to the schools above the junior college level in the Northeast region, except for the schools in the unrecovered areas, are generally in line with the methods indicated by the Ministry.</p>
<h3 id="e107">Education Bureau Regularly Convening Private Elementary School Principals for Talks <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>Second Batch of National Education Classes to Continue with 100 Classes</p>
<p>In order to promote national education, the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau has designated private schools to run national education classes. It is now designated that each school will run two classes from September (including children's classes and adult classes), and the principals of each school will serve as the heads of the classes.

<p>The Municipal Government's Department of Civil Affairs conducted an intensive training program for public administration personnel in the city. The first training session, which began on the 11th of this month, featured an exceptionally tight schedule, keeping the department's staff extremely busy. On the afternoon of the 13th, a practice exercise was held to re-verify household registrations. All 280-plus trainees were divided into 57 groups, led by instructors to the 81st Bao in the Fifth District for on-site re-verification. On the morning of the 14th, the results of the re-verification were transcribed. Each trainee also presented the difficulties encountered during the household registration re-verification and transcription for discussion in small group meetings in the afternoon. Instructors answered each question one by one. Finally, at 5:00 PM, Section Chief Chen delivered a closing speech before the trainees were dismissed. The trainees expressed great interest in this training and gained considerable knowledge and experience in public administration. They felt that the training period was too short and that they should maintain contact with each other in their future work to jointly seek improvements. To foster camaraderie among the graduating trainees, they suggested to Section Chief Chen that a alumni association be organized and a directory published. Section Chief Chen immediately agreed to plan this after the training of all public administration personnel in the city is completed. It is reported that the second and third training sessions will begin simultaneously on the 18th.</p>
<p>Instructions for Completing the Household Re-Verification Form</p>
<p>The Second Section of the Shanghai Municipal Government's Department of Civil Affairs has recently compiled "Instructions for Completing the Household Re-Verification Form Before Registration Transcription," as follows:</p>
<p>Re-verifying household registrations before transcribing them into the registry is of utmost importance. Because this is the first time setting up a household registry, the obligor is not required to fill out another household registration application. The household survey form will serve as the application. Since the household survey was conducted in this city in February, there have been many discrepancies between the household information recorded on the household survey form and the actual household situation. Therefore, the original household survey form cannot be rashly used as the basis for transcription. A household re-verification must be carried out before transcription.</p>
<p>Secondly, existing household survey forms contain many errors because (1) the personnel handling the initial household survey were unfamiliar with the form-filling methods, and (2) the laws and regulations have changed repeatedly, leaving the form-fillers at a loss. If transcription is based on these errors, the errors will be compounded. Correcting errors after household registration is cumbersome, so a detailed re-verification must be carried out before transcription to avoid registration errors.</p>
<p>Now that the transcription work is about to begin, we must clearly recognize the following points before re-verifying household registrations: (1) There must be absolutely no errors in any of the household registration fields. Therefore, the household survey form must be accurately recorded before transcription. (2) After household registration begins, household administration in this city will be brought onto the right track, and there should no longer be any inaccurate household registration information. (3) To ensure the accuracy of household registration, it must start with the household. Every household and every individual must be accurately recorded. One Jia, one Bao, and even the entire city will be accurate. Therefore, every citizen and every re-verification staff member must recognize this point, cherish household administration in this city, and not be careless or sloppy with household re-verification.</p>
<p>To ensure accurate re-verification, the form-filling methods for each field of the household survey form are explained in detail below for reference by the citizens of this city and all levels of public administration personnel. Furthermore, these instructions are a unified regulation for past form-filling methods. In the future, all application forms and registration books shall be filled out in accordance with these instructions.</p>
<p>1.  Relationship to Head of Household The "Relationship to Head of Household" explains the identity relationship of each member within the household. The identity relationship of each member within a common household is centered on the head of household. Therefore, how each member is related is based on the head of household as the referent. When surveying a household, it is easy to make mistakes if someone other than the head of household answers the surveyor. For example, if the head of household is the "father," and the "second son" answers during the survey, the "eldest daughter-in-law" may mistakenly answer as "sister-in-law." Therefore, when citizens answer surveyors or fill out application forms themselves, they should use the tone of the head of household so that the relationship of each person is not mistaken. Survey personnel should pay more attention to this type of error during surveys. The identity relationship of each member within a common business household can be filled out according to each person's position within the business organization, such as "accountant" or "shopkeeper" in a store, or "teacher" or "student" in a school.</p>
<p>2.  Name "Name" is a person's identifying mark in society. A person's rights and obligations are based on their name. Therefore, the name entered should be the name commonly used in society. Pseudonyms, assumed names, or a woman's customary use of "So-and-so Shi" should not be used. The "Regulations on Restrictions on the Use of Names" promulgated by the National Government on July 17, 1941, contain the following provisions regarding names, which demonstrate that filling out the name when registering a household must be done with caution.</p>
<p>(Article 1) A citizen of the Republic of China shall have only one given name. The name registered in the household registry is the given name. A person using a courtesy name or pseudonym shall indicate their given name. (Article 2) The acquisition, establishment, transfer, or alteration of property rights shall be done using the given name or by indicating the given name. (Article 3) If shared property is used under a trade name or other name, the given names of the co-owners shall be indicated. If the total number of co-owners exceeds twenty, only the given names of the representatives may be indicated. (Article 6) In response to a lawful investigation by a public official, the given name shall be reported. Failure to use the given name shall be punishable by detention or a fine of one hundred yuan or less.</p>
<p>3.  Gender Indicate male or female. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e119">Stock Exchange's First Day of Trading Sees Over 4 Million Shares Traded - Bull Market Shows High Prices but Lackluster Momentum - Collective Accounting at 5 PM Yields Good Results <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Stock Exchange officially opened trading on various listed stocks at 10:00 AM yesterday. After a bull market opening, trading was generally stable. The atmosphere was also quite relaxed. After two hours of trading, prices of all stocks trended downwards.</p>
<p>At 9:50 AM, Chairman of the Board Du Yong, General Manager Wang Zhixin, Assistant Managers Yang Yinbo and Gu Shanchang, Chief Secretary Hua Wenyu, Manager Chen Xubi, and Deputy Manager Zhang Jisan entered the trading floor in succession. At exactly 10:00 AM, Du himself rang the opening bell. As the bell rang, each trading counter began its bull market. Five minutes later, the bull markets for each stock opened. The bell rang again, and official trading began. The shouts of brokers buying and selling immediately followed.</p>
<p>Yesterday's market in general was relatively stable. Due to psychological factors, blue-chip stocks ("two big, three small") and a few unpopular mid-sized stocks saw high prices in the bull market opening. After opening prices were established, bullish investors took profits, gradually being pressured by sellers. However, financial backers intermittently provided some support, so although the process was lackluster, there were many fluctuations. Throughout the market, only the unpopular small stocks Huafeng Enamel and Liann Department Store stood out. The former was boosted by scattered speculative funds, and the latter deliberately pushed up its price near noon, ending at a high price. However, trading in these two stocks was not widespread. As a result, compared to the previous closing, Yong'an Textile and Meiya (probably a stock abbreviation) fell slightly, while Jingfu, Xinguang, and Qinxing each fell half a percent. Among unpopular stocks, besides Huafeng and Lian'an being the most prominent, the former rose slightly, while the latter opened low but rose by over 20%, ending at the highest price, resulting in a sharp increase of 40% compared to last Saturday. The rest fell slightly. Mid-sized stocks saw a rebound of half a percent.</p>
<p>Yesterday's price limits for each stock were calculated separately based on the bull market opening prices of each stock. In the future, the price limits for each stock will be calculated separately based on the previous day's closing price.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the total number of shares traded was 4,347,400. The stock with the highest trading volume was Yong'an Textile Factory, reaching 1.2 million shares. Jingfu also had nearly 500,000 shares. The trading volume of Xinguang, Qinxing, and Yong'an Company stocks also exceeded 300,000 shares each. China Textile and China Silk Industry had lower volumes, both under 10,000 shares.</p>
<p>At 5:00 PM, all brokers gathered at the market to collectively close their accounts. By 6:39 PM, all accounts were balanced. The Stock Exchange authorities were satisfied. The Stock Exchange also posted several announcements in the stock market yesterday. The important ones are summarized below:</p>
<p>Announcement No. 14: When delivering shares, each broker must attach the following documents to each share certificate: 1. A securities delivery voucher must be attached to the front of the share certificate. 2. The following must be attached to the back of the share certificate:</p>
<p>(1) Share transfer application form. (2) Share trading record form. (3) Share sale contract (red or blue is acceptable). All of the above must be stamped with the broker's official seal.</p>
<p>Announcement No. 15: Regarding securities settlement matters, please pay attention to the following points, listed separately: 1. For the convenience of settlement, each broker should submit bank drafts that can be exchanged, and must stamp the back of the draft with the broker's name and number seal. 2. To ensure smooth settlement for each broker, it is more convenient for even-numbered firms to open accounts with the Bank of China, and odd-numbered firms to open accounts with the Trust Department of the Bank of Communications. 3. Due to exchange time constraints, collections are from 9:00 AM to 11:00 AM. 4. Securities received are limited to 11:30 AM to 2:00 PM. 5. Securities issued are limited to 9:30 AM to 11:30 AM the next morning. 6. Payment for goods issued is limited to 1:00 PM to 3:00 PM.</p>

<p>Yesterday, smelting red gold was very ordinary. It opened in the morning at 2.155 million, which was quickly surrounded by sellers. The Central Bank had some control, gradually declining to below 2.14 million. After 10:00 AM, the Central Bank allocated four or five bars at a price of 2.14 million. Afterwards, it was more peaceful, hovering between 2.13 million and 2.14 million. At noon, it struggled at 2.14 million. The afternoon was slightly more stable, with no major changes. The result was a decline of 23,000 compared to last Saturday. Gold jewelry was at 22,700. Silver bullion was flat. Silver coins rose slightly. Black market interest rates have retreated to within 1.5 jiao.</p>
<p>Foreign currencies were quiet and slightly weak. The US dollar started selling at 3,400 yuan in the morning, gradually trending downward. It once fell as low as 3,350 yuan near noon. At noon, it hovered around 3,360 yuan. The afternoon was slightly better, but lacked special changes. The result was a drop of 20 yuan compared to last Saturday. Hong Kong dollars were unstable. Hong Kong telegraphic transfers were as high as 144.5 yuan, with the exchange rate just over 692 yuan, showing a slight weakness, with a result of 5 yuan lower than last Saturday.

<p>Government bonds yesterday still saw many short sales, slightly declining. Series C bonds opened in the morning at 2,350 yuan, which was quickly competed for by sellers, gradually trending downward.

After several firms actively traded, it closed above 2,100 yuan, resulting in a decline of 200 yuan compared to last Saturday. Series A and B fell slightly by 250 yuan. Series D fell by 100 yuan. Series E also fell by 150 yuan. The volume of transactions reached over 6 million yuan in face value.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks saw some short positions cut due to the lack of news about the opening of trading. The overall trend was unfavorable. Except for steel, which rose slightly, the rest fell from the opening price. As a result, compared to the previous closing, steel rose slightly, Yibier (probably stock abbreviation) fell slightly, Asian fell by 10%, and the rest fell by about half a percent.</p>
<h3 id="e122">Tea Market Transactions Decrease Slightly <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>For red and green tea varieties, Tianjin brokers' efforts to move goods remain stagnant. Foreign firms' transactions were also not as active as last week. Because ships sailing overseas on the 23rd have been loaded with a considerable amount of goods from each exporting firm, and are awaiting shipment, buying sentiment has been reduced. The sale of Taiwan fine red tea and native firm textile products has been discussed between buyers and sellers several times, but a satisfactory solution has not yet been reached.</p>

<p>[Our Report] The Niels Maersk, managed by the Great Britain Company, arrived from Bombay yesterday, carrying 8,000 tons of cotton, about 29,000-plus bales, as well as residual drums of glycerol.

<p>The recent market price of Mexican gold is US$1,200 per kilogram. One kilogram equals 2.204 pounds, which is equal to 2 Chinese market catties. Calculated at the current exchange rate of 3,350 yuan, the cost per ten taels is only worth 1,256,250 yuan in legal tender. If the exchange rate had not increased, each ten taels would still be less than one million yuan.</p>

<p>Rayon stocks are dwindling daily. Fangjian (probably a company abbreviation) has indicated that distribution will be suspended. Furthermore, due to repeated rumors that rayon to be shipped to Shanghai has completely disappeared, people are panicking, causing the black market price to rise wildly yesterday. No. 120 Tiantong Youguang opened at 2.78 million yuan, with transactions at 800,000 yuan. Afterwards, it rose to close at 870,000 yuan. In the afternoon, because there were many inquiries from manufacturers and actual users, holders were hoarding and raising prices, pushing it up to close at 960,000 yuan, which is more than 200,000 yuan higher than last Saturday. Assorted brands also rose by more than 200,000 yuan. Factory silk of high uniformity and fiber count saw no transactions because the market price did not match the international price. The opening price of the actual demand was high, priced at 40,000 to 50,000 yuan. Yesterday, Qingfeng Silk sold goods worth 75%, priced at 2.7 million yuan. Silk fabrics were strong and beautiful.

<p>[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 16th] Regarding the issue of industrial and commercial remittances, the Economic Committee of the Northeast Headquarters decided to handle it in accordance with the "Implementation Measures for Industrial and Commercial Remittances in the Nine Northeastern Provinces" promulgated in mid-September. The exchange rate between the nine northeastern provinces and the interior will be determined by the Central Bank posting daily rates. The exchange rate from the Northeast to Tianjin and Beiping is 1 to 11.5 yuan. The exchange rate from Tianjin and Beiping to the Northeast is 1 to 22.5 yuan. Except for remittances from military and government agencies, which are remitted by the Central Bank at the posted exchange rate, ordinary remittances are temporarily handled by the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, the Farmers Bank, and the Central Trust Bureau. In the past, public servants' family support remittances handled by the Central Bank will also be handled as ordinary remittances from now on. The difference between the old and new exchange rates will be subsidized by the Headquarters to prevent public servants from suffering losses due to exchange rate fluctuations. Furthermore, the ordinary exchange rate originally changes at any time depending on various factors such as market capital supply and demand, trade exports, and price levels.

<p>Yesterday morning was rainy. Although the rice market was bullish, it was unable to rise due to the flooding of supply. The situation was firm in the morning and weak in the afternoon, and the result was still flat. Medium-grade indica rice felt quite soft, as was new japonica. White rice transactions were scarce and remained downstream. Mid-grade white rice and new Yinyuan rice suffered from a lack of buyers. High-quality goods saw some inquiries. The future situation is temporarily difficult to improve. White rice in bulk in the Xihe area began to try using Douzi (a measuring tool) yesterday. The supply and demand of flour are balanced. The supply from Minyong and Qingdao to the Animal Husbandry Bureau is scarce, and prices are raised. The market also had little fluctuation. Bran prices were fluctuating. The oil market, due to the arrival of some goods in Qingdao, and factory supplies of soybean oil and rapeseed oil for the Grain United, store interest turned sluggish, and oil prices fell across the board by 3,000 to 4,000 yuan. Medium-grade soybeans in Shantou saw slight inquiries, and high prices moved slightly. Medium-grade products remained dull. Raw peanuts in Nanyang saw inquiries again, and high-quality goods weakened and turned strong, seeing an increase of 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Medium-grade products in Benjie and the market were still mediocre. High-quality goods were stable, and medium-to-low quality goods weakened first. Yellow hemp rebounded slightly by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e130">Double Horse Price Unchanged - 2,300 Bales of Yarn Distributed - Yarn Firms Get a Share - Market Is Flat and Lackluster - Piece Goods Sales Are Not Strong - Foundation Is Still Solid <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Silk Factory Joint Distribution Committee convened a regular meeting at 3:00 PM yesterday, selling a standard quota of 20-count cotton yarn. Fangjian received 1,814 bales, and private companies received 491.5 bales. The selling price was based on 1.3 million yuan per bale of 400-pound 20-count Double Horse yarn. Private factories were fully allocated according to their application amounts. In addition to the factories directly producing the textiles, Fangjian will also allocate to yarn firms according to their applications.</p>
<p>The yarn market was calm and uneventful yesterday. Because the Minyue gang had no ships and the route was blocked, large Double Horse yarn saw few inquiries. The market had a dismal outlook. Small and medium-sized yarns were purchased by the Changjiang gang. The supply and demand was balanced and the market was unchanged. The market gradually declined near noon. The initial price of 42-count Blue Phoenix was 2.3 million yuan, which later became 2.24 million yuan. The initial price of old Double Horse yarn was 1.5 million yuan, which later fell by 50,000 yuan. The new Singles initially fell from around 1.4 million to 1.35 million yuan.</p>
<p>The slump in business in the Southern gang is partly due to the lack of control over visa exports. Therefore, they all detour to Jiangxi for transport, which, although time-consuming, is still profitable. However, the inability to transport grain along that line smoothly has affected their revenue.</p>
<p>The cloth market remains old. Blue V-shaped cloth is 62,000 yuan. 3A Rainbow Ball is 62,500 yuan. Unbranded Rainbow Ball is priced at 55,500 yuan. The Dragon Head has not opened. Although the price is 27,500 yuan, there are no goods. Four Gentlemen Serge is priced as high as 65,500 yuan, because Fangjian has not distributed it several times. In short, yesterday the entire market was flat. Sales have not been brisk. Inventory is also lacking. The foundation is still solid.</p>
<h3 id="e131">Hong Kong's Ban on Cloth Exports Can Stabilize Yarn Prices - Official of Fangjian Says <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>An official in charge of the business division of China Textile Construction Company recently expressed the following opinions on the Hong Kong authorities' formal order to ban the export of cotton cloth from the 15th of this month: (1) Hong Kong's adoption of this strict measure was implemented at the request of Premier Song Ziwen. (2) Smuggling in South China is extremely rampant, and the smuggling and tax evasion will be eliminated immediately. (3) Smuggled cotton yarn in South China is woven into cloth in Hong Kong and then transported to the South Sea Islands. However, the current exchange rate in the South Sea has not been determined, so it cannot be allowed to leak out at will. The official finally stated that Hong Kong's ban on cotton cloth exports would be sufficient to maintain stable yarn prices.</p>

<p>[United Press, Washington, 15th] The high tariff policies adopted by countries such as India, Brazil, Mexico, Chile, and Australia have made the US plan to reduce pre-war trade barriers more complicated. Several countries attempting to industrialize have made it clear that while they support the US study of this issue, they feel that high tariffs are essential to protect their new industries. The US Department of Commerce has suggested that countries reduce tax rates simultaneously. US government trade experts admit that their mission seems more difficult than it initially appeared.</p>

<p>Elephant brand cement produced by Shanghai Cement Company was sold throughout the area before the war. Later, due to the retreat of the National Army to the west, it had to stop work. The factory was utilized by the enemy and puppets. In addition, the machine was only damaged but not repaired in the last eight years, and it was unusable. The factory owner, Mr. Liu Guanghong, set out to repair a part and continue operations. Unexpectedly, it was hit by foreign goods, resulting in a collapse. The Longhua factory announced the dismissal of 234 workers the day before yesterday afternoon due to sluggish business, accounting for about three-quarters of the total. This caused strong opposition from the labor side. Yesterday morning, the Cement Industry Union and several workers went to the Social Affairs Bureau to petition, demanding that the factory revoke the order.</p>

The conference was held here at the US Information Service and was similar in nature to a farewell to the people of Guangdong. The mission will depart from Guangzhou by plane this month via Shanghai to Taiwan. Dr. Hutchinson said: The mission believes that China's most valuable resource is its vast manpower, but it needs to be encouraged. He said: No country with agriculture as its foundation has a high standard of living. Therefore, China should move towards industrialization while improving agricultural methods.

<p>[Our Newspaper Report] The Municipal Chamber of Commerce recently addressed the Executive Yuan again regarding the lifting of the flour transshipment ban. The original petition stated in brief: “We recently received a telegram from the Jinjiang County Chamber of Commerce of Fujian Province, stating: Jinjiang is experiencing a grain shortage, and relies on Shanghai flour for supply. Due to crop failures last year, coupled with the ban on Shanghai flour transport, the grain shortage is particularly severe. As the time between harvests approaches, aid is urgently needed. We specifically request permission to allocate 100,000 bags of flour to be shipped to Jinjiang for emergency relief, etc.” Upon investigation, the matter of lifting the flour transshipment ban has been repeatedly requested by chambers of commerce from various regions. This reflects a real need that cannot be delayed. We have previously submitted a telegram on record. Given the current situation, it is appropriate to forward this to your esteemed Yuan. We implore you to consider the famine and grant special permission.”</p>

<p>With the arrival of autumn, major dyeing and printing factories in Shanghai are operating around the clock, resulting in a huge consumption of caustic soda. According to market estimates, there are currently over forty small and medium-sized dyeing and printing factories in the city, all of which need to purchase caustic soda. Yarn factories are also in urgent need, with each factory purchasing an average of fifty drums. Including the yarn factories, a total of two to three thousand drums of spot goods need to be supplied at once. Furthermore, merchants from Tianjin, Chongqing, Wuhan, and Jiangxi are all scouring Shanghai for supplies. In the past two weeks, the price has risen by 250,000 yuan per drum. It is reported that most raw material merchants have had their orders for caustic soda from the United States rejected, and foreign firms are unwilling to sell spot goods.</p>

<h3 id="e144">Record of the Recovery of Chengde <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>— Central News Agency dispatch from Chaoyang, 9th</p>
<p>Rehe fell to the enemy in the year following the September 18th Incident, held captive for thirteen years. The people longed day and night for the motherland to liberate them. When the Japanese devils surrendered with a thunderclap, men, women, old and young were overjoyed. Last year, during the Mid-Autumn Festival, unfamiliar Eighth Route Army troops arrived. They were mistaken for National Revolutionary Army, and welcomed with joy. After a period of time, they received the "blessings" of this fake National Revolutionary Army, which only brought struggle, and extortionate levies, and the people became lost. During this time of unclear authenticity, the Communist army invaded and occupied Chengde, Chifeng, and various counties in northern Rehe. The National Revolutionary Army recovering the northern frontier was blocked east of Pingquan, and south of Gushan (70 li south of Chifeng). In May, they were forced to retreat from Gushan to Yebaishou, and from then on, the northwest of Rehe was plunged into deep water and scorching fire.</p>
<p>Counterattack Begins, Rapid Advance　Thereafter, the people of Chifeng and Chengde counties, unable to bear the harassment of the Communist army, repeatedly sent representatives to meet with General Shi Jue, the military commander of the National Revolutionary Army, and Liu Duoquan, chairman of the provincial government, requesting a speedy advance to relieve them from their plight. The authorities were always constrained by the ceasefire agreement, and unable to advance. This not only went against the wishes of the people, but also caused misunderstandings among middle and lower-ranking officers and soldiers. Especially after the retreat from Gushan, the officers and soldiers of the 13th Army suffered illegal attacks from the Communist army day and night, and were almost consumed by anger. This time, in order to thwart the Communist army's conspiracy to attack the National Revolutionary Army and open up eastern Hebei, the 13th Army issued an order to advance to meet the enemy. The soldiers rubbed their fists and showed smiles, no longer complaining about their superiors.</p>
<p>The counterattack began on August 27th. The 13th Army was responsible for the northern route, heading straight for Chifeng from Yebaishou. The plan was to recover the territory by September 5th, but the mission was completed on August 29th. The 100 kilometers of rugged mountain roads took only two and a half days. On the same day, the northern route also recovered Gubei, and the next day crossed the Heishui River, reaching Nailin, within the borders of Chifeng. The speed of the advance was sufficient to prove the strength of the National Revolutionary Army. At the same time, Chairman Liu Dongkui personally braved danger, leading the civilian workers to repair the roads along with the army. The residents nearby braved the hail of bullets to carry water to the front lines, entirely out of their own volition. This showed the spirit of cooperation between the military, government, officials and people everywhere, and their hatred for the Communist army.</p>
<p>Beautiful Outline Completely Deformed</p>
<p>In mid-June, this reporter wrote an article titled "Chengde Weekly," introducing the beautiful outline of Chengde. Now, this beautiful city is deformed. The Communist army destroyed and plundered while retreating, leaving the city without electricity, the houses damaged, and the wealth gone. The airport, the smallest in scale and the only one with an asphalt runway in all of Rehe, was also damaged beyond repair. Everywhere exposed traces of the Communist army's thieving acts. However, when asked, the merchants and civilians who had been swept clean said, "Although our belongings are gone, spiritually, it's like a shackle has been lifted." Yes, they feel relieved to have received the army of the motherland.</p>
<p>Although most of the shops in the market have reopened, business is still sluggish for the following reasons: (1) Nineteen out of ten old shops were struggled against and liquidated. For months, the prosperous Nanyingzi Street trade was monopolized by the Communist Party's agency cooperatives. Before the retreat, official and private goods were swept away and plundered westward. (2) The Communist army used the "Legal Tender" extensively, issuing border currency in excess. During the retreat, they plundered the Legal Tender that civilians had saved, and fled with it fully loaded. After the recovery, no one accepted the border currency, and Legal Tender and circulating notes were difficult to use as chips. (3) The Pingquan-Gubei and Jinzhou-Gubei roads are not open, and daily necessities are not easily transported from Beiping or Jinzhou in the short term. This year, Rehe is expected to have a good harvest, and food is not a problem in itself, but Chengde is currently experiencing a shortage. White rice and flour are nowhere to be seen. This is all a temporary phenomenon. After Shi Jue took office as the Chengde Garrison Commander, he calmed the military and civilians while rushing to repair the destroyed buildings. The order of the market is recovering extremely quickly.</p>
<p>Rushing to Repair Day and Night to Provide Support</p>
<p>The highway and railway from Pingquan to Chengde were thoroughly destroyed. The roadbed could not be seen, and not a single sleeper was left. A few steel rails could be seen intermittently, lying crookedly on the distant slopes. Not a single iron bridge was intact. In addition to slogans slandering the head of state, the bridge piers also had white slogans such as "Build a Democratic Country" and "Build a New Rehe." This "build" slogan was painted on the destroyed bridge piers, which could be called a great farce. Wan Guobin, director of the Jinzhou Railway Bureau, and Li Xian, brigadier general and commander of the engineer corps of the Northeast Security Command, have followed the army westward, supervising the staff to rush to repair day and night. The Lingyuan-Pingquan section is expected to be completed within days. If it can be repaired to Chengde, then once the Jinzhou-Chengde Railway is open, Chengde can undoubtedly be declared prosperous. Chairman Liu Duoquan followed the army west on August 27th. After Chengde was captured, he returned to Chaoyang once, instructing the various departments and offices of the provincial government to prepare to return to Chengde. Without even warming his seat, he and Commissioner Li Shoulien led the Chengde, Luanping, and other county magistrates westward in haste. He arrived in Pingquan yesterday, and is heading to Chengde today. Various departments of the provincial government have also transferred a number of personnel to Chengde to take over the relevant business. A provincial government office has been established in Chengde, and it is expected that all personnel can be fully repatriated within a month. According to Chairman Liu's words to the reporter, all preparations are in place, waiting only for the availability of transportation. Chief Education Officer Liu said that "after the schools in Chengde are restored, the greatest difficulty is finding teachers, especially for middle schools." It is said that Chairman Liu is also determined to do his best to improve this. The reporter hereby sends a message to scholars in Beiping and Tianjin to consider this.</p>

<p>Opinions on Selling Sugar at Controlled Prices</p>
<p>This city is selling sugar at controlled prices again, which is truly a blessing for the citizens. Although there have been several sales before, the order was very chaotic. In the end, it was still the young and strong who benefited. Moreover, although the authorities stipulated that each person was limited to three catties, in reality, southern goods merchants used the excuse of general sales and limited each person to one or two catties. There were very few who sold according to the regulations of the authorities. This time, it is stipulated that each person is limited to two catties with their ID card, and the time is extended, with sales also in the morning, so the order is gradually improving. However, using ID cards is still not fair, because ID cards are only issued to people over the age of thirteen, so children under the age of thirteen do not have the fortune to enjoy it. In fact, children need more sugar than adults, especially babies. Therefore, I hope that next time, sales can be further improved, with each household using a household registration card to receive the sugar at once. This would greatly simplify the time and procedures. I hope the relevant authorities will pay attention. (Zhou Li)</p>
<p>Arbitrary Price Increases for Highway Bus Tickets</p>
<p>Editor: There are buses that go directly from Jianbi to Zhenjiang, departing every day in the morning and afternoon. A few days ago, they departed on time, with each ticket costing 800 yuan, and each bus carrying 30 people, selling tickets for 24,000 yuan. Yesterday afternoon, the bus from Zhenjiang to Jianbi, charged 2,000 yuan per person, with 22 passengers, totaling 44,000 yuan. They also did not sell tickets. I went to ask them why they did not sell tickets according to regulations? The staff replied in a nasty voice, "Those who want to ride can ride, what regulations?" I believe Zhenjiang is the capital of Jiangsu Province. Isn't the establishment of the highway for the convenience of the people? (Zhu Youming)</p>
<p>Please Restore Routes 1 and 9 Buses</p>
<p>Editor: I am a resident near Zhaofeng Park. In the past, there were Routes 1 and 9 buses from Zhaofeng Park that could go directly to the Bund, and there were also trolleybuses that could reach Jing'an Temple, which was very convenient for residents. Since the January 28th Incident, the buses have stopped running, relying only on trolleybuses, and the congestion is indescribable. Now that the War of Resistance has been won, public cars have been temporarily replaced in the public bureaus in various places, but only this place is still lacking. Why is the authorities favoring one over the other? The Zhaofeng Park area is a residential area, and residents travel back and forth to the central district several times a day. Moreover, there are passengers from the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway West Station, students from St. John's and Great China Universities, and visitors to Zhaofeng Park. The number of passengers is unparalleled. When Routes 1 and 9 buses were running in the past, it was also very crowded. Now, only three or four trolleybuses run between them. How can they be enough? As a result, visitors to Zhaofeng Park are becoming increasingly deserted. The misery of squeezing onto the bus is like escaping from a disaster. Now, temporary public cars are run every Sunday when the park holds concerts. It seems that the establishment of this car is only for the convenience of listening to music! If the cars could run according to the old Route 1, then the passengers at the trolleybus stops at Jing'an Temple, Seymour Road, Carter Road, and Chengdu Road would definitely not be so crowded. I hope the authorities will think twice. (Xu Bing)</p>
<p>Many Door Numbers Are Confused and Unclear</p>
<p>Editor: The door numbers of the shops and households along the lanes north of Zhongzheng Road are all made of tinplate, painted with white background and black characters. After years of disrepair, they have become unrecognizable. In many places, each household has two door numbers with different numbers. There are even those who deliberately remove the door numbers. I don't know what the purpose is. The door number is one of the addresses, which should not be ignored. I hope the relevant authorities will start to improve this immediately. (Zhang Qiu)</p>
<p>Unclean Lanes Hinder Hygiene</p>
<p>Editor: I am a student and live in Xicheng Lane, Ximen Road, Madang Road. The lane was originally very clean, but recently the entrance and bottom of the lane are extremely dirty. The reason is this: The street sweepers in the lane, citing that their salaries cannot be maintained, have gathered their fellow villagers and relatives to set up steamed bun stalls, etc., at the entrance of the lane, causing oil and water to splash everywhere and obstructing traffic. There was originally a wooden house at the bottom of the lane for the street sweepers to live in. Recently, they claimed that it was not easy to find a house, so their accomplices have been using the area next to the wooden house as a place to live, and storing a large amount of straw, raising chickens and ducks, and unlicensed fierce dogs (events of biting young children often occur). As a result, the stench is overwhelming, and cooking is done there, which is very easy to cause a fire. I hope the relevant authorities will take action to maintain local hygiene. (Cai Zhiping)</p>

<p>— Nanjing, 6th, Yang Yanbing</p>
<p>At the reception for reporters hosted by Chief of General Staff Chen of the Ministry of National Defense, the reporter received a report from another colleague that the Paratrooper General Team would hold its first grand exercise in Nanjing the next day. This valuable clue excited the reporters too much. Quietly thinking about tomorrow's wonderful festival, and at the same time, guessing whether they would let us look at the "heavenly soldiers and generals" descending to occupy the land from the air? The mind was concentrated and the spirit soared, and the whole night was spent in turmoil.</p>
<p>Early in the morning of the 5th, the reporter woke up in the roar of engines, and looked at his watch, it was already 7:20. Hurried, hurried, he rushed to complete the entire grooming and housekeeping in three minutes. He took a car and desperately went to the gathering place at Xinjiekou. At this time, there were not many people on the street. News vendors shouted along the street. When the car passed Zhongzheng Road, I saw the cars of colleagues driving towards Zhonghua Gate one by one. The car drove faster after leaving Zhonghua Gate. The reporter was in the closest car and was the first to arrive at the review location of the Paratrooper General Team, and couldn't help but be extremely excited!</p>
<p>At this time, I could see rows and rows of paratroopers neatly arranged on the large parade ground. The reporter followed the signpost and went to the inspection ground. The receptionists greeted with smiles and gave out today's program. On the signature book, I discovered that Minister of National Defense Bai Chongxi, General Jiansheng was also here. Minister Bai has been busy with military affairs, and I have not seen him for a long time. Being able to see his demeanor again today is another gain from participating in the grand ceremony.</p>
<p>At 8:00 AM sharp, Minister Bai led Lieutenant General Ma Chongliu, Lieutenant General Xu Tingyao, and more than 30 inspection officers and entourage forward to the inspection ground. At this time, Commander Ma of the Paratrooper General Team had rushed from the defense area in Suzhou to accompany the inspection. Minister Bai nodded frequently as he walked to each row, appearing very happy. Afterwards, he visited the internal affairs, parachute folding practice, asked many questions, and gave instructions. When visiting the weapons, General Ma Chongliu explained the latest American rifle to Minister Bai. Minister Bai picked up the gun and made an anchoring motion, and smiled at the reporter: "I joined the army at the age of twenty, and have always been accustomed to using a rifle. Today, I picked up this American rifle, and it is completely different from the rifle I used thirty years ago. Scientific progress is truly overwhelming."</p>
<h3 id="e147">The Growth of Seedlings, a Sign of National Rebirth <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>Immediately, he visited basic parachuting. The reporter thought that the growth of this seedling of national defense is a sign of the rebirth of the Republic of China. He excitedly asked Minister Bai about the future goals of paratrooper construction, and he told the reporter: "The Chinese paratroopers were established in 1943. In the past two years, the war exploits of attacking Hengyang, Danzhu, and Guilin were truly too great. We must make these batches of seedlings grow well. We are prepared to expand into many divisions and many armies to take on future national defense missions."... At 10:15, he visited battlefield psychological testing. A heated and wonderful scene unfolded on a field of several hundred meters. Dozens of soldiers practiced crossing the battlefield in a crossfire of landmines, artillery shells, and bombs. At this time, the firepower was dense, the sounds were continuous, and landmines and bombs exploded at the same time. The fireworks of red and green flares enveloped the Chen terrain. Dimly, I saw soldiers crawling forward on the field, as if facing a great enemy. Minister Bai asked the reporters several times, "Is the action good?" His words seemed to contain unlimited joy. Immediately, he visited. The combat exercises were also extremely impressive. Minister Bai said to the reporters during the proceedings: "Are there any reporters from the New China Daily today? We would be very welcome if they came to see us." This aroused a burst of smiles from the reporters.</p>
<p>At 11:30, the visit was over, and after a brief refreshment in the reception room, he took a car and returned to the city.</p>
<h3 id="e148">Air Force Parachuting, the Program Is Special and Wonderful <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>At 1:30 PM, at Ming Palace Airport, he visited Air Force parachuting. This was the most brilliant and unprecedented program in the capital. The emotions of the paratrooper soldiers were hotter than the scorching autumn sun. They were about to present the beautiful postures of combat in the skies over Guangdong, Luoding, Xijiang, and Hengyang to the millions of citizens and senior military officers in the capital. At this time, there were people everywhere inside and outside the Air Force Transportation Station. Commander-in-Chief of the Air Force, Lieutenant General Zhou Zhirou arrived the earliest. Minister Bai also came with his wife and two sons. Lieutenant General Ma Chongtian, Lieutenant General Xu Ting??, Lieutenant General Zhang Zhen, Police Chief Han Wenhuan, and a special car from the Ministry of National Defense loaded ten officials came. In addition, there were dozens of female relatives. Three large Model 47 aircraft faced the reviewing stand. The 36 soldiers participating in the parachuting were assigned to three special aircraft, No. 302, No. 297, and No. 296, with twelve people on each aircraft. When they were disembarking to board the plane, the reporter group seized the opportunity and requested to visit the plane. As a result, the nine reporters were divided into three groups, with three people on each aircraft. I walked into the aircraft door with joy and curiosity. After a while, the engine made a loud noise, and the aircraft slowly rose. It circled in the air first, and the commanding instructors Chen Zhonggui, Huang Kai, Wang Keqiu, and Yang Derun led the singing of "Paratrooper Song." Most of them had fought in Kaiping, Guangdong, and had risked their lives in the flames of war. Today they deserved to be proud. Looking down from the window again, the fields and streams were scattered like stars. The Yangtze River was like a belt, and Qingliang Mountain and Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum gradually passed by.</p>
<h3 id="e149">A Lily Drifting in the Air <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>After only about five minutes, we reached an altitude of one thousand feet. A series of rapid bells rang from the tail of the aircraft, indicating that this was the signal to start parachuting. Then a rubber man for measuring wind direction was pushed out of the aircraft door to test the wind direction. The people in the cabin quickly looked at the posture of the landing. The first person to perform on Aircraft No. 302, which the reporter was riding, was Instructor Bird Qifa, a captain. He made a ready-to-jump posture in front of the aircraft door. The two instructors next to him checked him. The aircraft made a large circle and had already reached above the Ming Palace. Captain Bird immediately jumped out of the aircraft door, and the two assistants were busy collecting the buckles. Everyone crowded to the aircraft door to watch. A beautiful lily was drifting in the air, slowly falling, and looked even more vivid, white, and beautiful in the sunlight. When the aircraft circled back and forth around the city and returned to the Ming Palace, the audience applauded continuously. After that, they jumped in groups of two and three. Each student opened the parachute three seconds after jumping out of the aircraft door. The diameter of the parachute was six feet. Lilies appeared in the clear sky, one after another. I couldn't help but salute the commanding instructor. When the fifth time they returned to the sky above the aircraft hangar, all twelve people had jumped. The driver, seeing that the mission was completed, headed towards the Ming Palace Airport to land. At this time, it was exactly 2:00 PM. The last time, twelve people landed simultaneously from two aircraft. The beautiful umbrellas were pure white, yellow, red, and green, slowly descending. What poetic works of art they were!</p>
<p>Finally, Minister Bai delivered a speech expressing his thoughts on the review: "These are the seedlings of our paratroopers. We must make them grow strong. Paratroopers are the newest type of scientific soldiers. We must build them up and coordinate with our national defense."</p>
<h3 id="e150">Black Sea Situation <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>— Our newspaper's Beijing-based reporter, Ding Weidong</p>
<p>Recently, the Black Sea situation has been very dangerous. The Soviet Union has formally proposed a demand for joint Soviet-Turkish defense of the Dardanelles Strait. They view it as a matter for the Black Sea nations, and do not want Britain, the United States, and France to participate in the negotiations. Britain, the United States, and Turkey, on the other hand, believe that this is an international issue, and any amendment to the Montreux Convention should be conducted through an international conference, and cannot be decided by the unilateral will of the Soviet Union. As of now, more than a million Red Army troops have gathered on the borders of the two countries, and a war of nerves is already underway! There is a chorus of resistance in the Turkish parliament. The United States has bluntly warned the Soviet Union that controlling the straits and controlling Asia could lead to war. The clouds of war seem to be looming again over the war-torn skies of Europe.</p>
<p>The political system of a country may change, the governing figures may change, but the historical background and geographical situation of a country will not change. Whether it is Tsarist Russia or the Soviet Union, the fact proves that the national aspirations of Russia will not change. Therefore, to understand the essence of the strait issue, it is better to seek it in Russian history than in grand diplomatic rhetoric.</p>
<h3 id="e151">"Constantinople World Hegemony" <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>The rise of modern Russia defeated two strong enemies in total. Under Peter the Great, he defeated Sweden, which dominated Northern Europe at that time, and obtained ports on the Baltic Sea. The "window" to the north was opened. In the south, Peter the Great's successor, Empress Catherine, repeatedly defeated Turkey, expanded its territory, and made Russia a Black Sea nation. Throughout the 19th century, Russia was committed to a southward policy, with the ultimate goal of obtaining Constantinople and controlling the Black Sea straits. In 1805, Napoleon of France dominated Europe, and defeated Russia on the plains of Poland, but in order to defend against Britain, he turned around and courted Russia, and the two sides signed the Treaty of Tilsit. The effect of this treaty was to divide the European continent into the spheres of influence of France and Russia. Western and Central Europe belonged to France, while Eastern and Northern Europe belonged to Russia. Everything went smoothly during the negotiations, but when the Russian Tsar mentioned Constantinople, Napoleon suddenly interrupted him and said heavily, "Constantinople? This is an issue of world hegemony!" The two sides negotiated repeatedly, but never reached an agreement. This unresolved issue eventually became the seed of the breakdown of French-Russian relations in 1812. From the Congress of Vienna to World War I, Balkan wars occurred frequently. In addition to ethnic hatred, the desire of Tsarist Russia to weaken Turkey and control the straits was an important reason.</p>
<h3 id="e152">The Straits Story: Endless Vicissitudes <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>At the beginning of World War I, in order to win over Russia and tie up German forces to prevent their concentration on the Western Front, Britain and France had agreed that after the war, Constantinople and the Black Sea Straits would be given to Imperial Russia as spoils of victory. St. Petersburg was overjoyed upon receiving this promise. In 1916, the Russian army suffered defeats on the Eastern Front, causing morale to waver. At the same time, due to Turkey's entry into the war, Russia was unable to receive supplies from Britain and France via the Black Sea route, putting it in a very difficult situation. At that time, the French ambassador to Russia (a historian and writer) saw lines of new Imperial Russian recruits in Petersburg during the snowy winter. These pitiful replacements were poorly clothed, some even barefoot. Due to a lack of rifles, some were even unarmed, struggling through the snow on their way to the front. The ambassador asked himself: How could Russia, in this critical situation, still have the confidence to continue fighting? His conclusion was, "The beautiful prospect of Constantinople is what guides them forward!"</p>
<p>Britain still holds the view that Turkey's attitude was quite hesitant during the First World War, and that its alliance with Germany was due to a chance occurrence. On the eve of the war, Turkey had ordered warships from the British Admiralty, but once the ships were completed, the European war situation had already developed, and Britain kept the warships for its own use, causing displeasure in Turkey. When the war broke out, two German warships escaped the search of the British Navy, entered the Black Sea Straits, and docked in Constantinople. This series of events became the spiritual capital for Germany to win over Turkey. Later, during the war, under Churchill's advocacy, Britain launched the so-called "Dardanelles Adventure," which resulted in heavy casualties and a disappointing retreat. However, historians later argued that if this operation had succeeded, Turkey would have certainly surrendered, which would have accelerated the defeat of the Central European powers and ended the European war two years earlier! After the end of the European war, Turkey and Greece went to war. The Greek invading forces retreated from the Turkish interior all the way to the straits. The Turkish army pursued them northward and could have crossed the narrow strait to recover its old territory in Europe, but the British Navy blockaded the straits at that time, waiting in battle array. Churchill wrote vividly in his memoirs: "The Admiralty had absolute confidence that it could prevent the Turkish army from entering Europe purely through naval power." After the Treaty of Lausanne was established, Turkey obtained an opportunity for self-reliance, but the straits became an undefended area, leading to the relocation of the capital of the new Turkey. The historical lesson of this World War is enough to prove that the Black Sea Straits are the lifeline of Turkey's national defense. If the straits fall into the hands of another country, Turkey's independence will exist in name only!</p>
<h3 id="e153">Britain and the US Advocate Joint Control <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>In this war, Turkey responded to the crisis with vigilance and autonomy, ultimately avoiding being drawn into the vortex of war. Although it did not participate in the war, the entire country remained in a state of mobilization from June 1940 onwards. The American Lend-Lease Act was also applied to Turkey. According to the British-Turkish Mutual Assistance Agreement, if Turkey were attacked, British air force from bases in Africa could reach Turkish airspace within five minutes. Turkish air force bases were completely transformed by British and American experts to facilitate the stationing of the air forces of both countries at any time. In fact, although Turkey did not participate in the war, it shielded the Middle East and indirectly contributed significantly to the Allied nations. During this war, Turkey's relationship with Germany and the Soviet Union was quite delicate, and two incidents occurred that were never fully resolved. The first was the attempted assassination of the German ambassador to Turkey, von Papen, in the Turkish capital. Berlin said it was done by Soviet personnel with the aim of causing a Turkish-German war and facilitating the entry of the Red Army into Turkish territory. Moscow said it was done by German special agents with the aim of creating a pretext for German aggression. Turkey's attitude was one of silence, and the case was never solved. The second was Germany's publication of a batch of documents and maps related to the Soviet Union's territorial demands on Turkey, which caused a great uproar. Germany insisted that the materials came from the Soviet Union and were very reliable; while Moscow strongly condemned the Nazis for undermining Soviet-Turkish relations. Throughout the war, Turkey was cautious, fearing imminent disaster, and fundamentally distrusted both Germany and the Soviet Union. As soon as the war ended, the Soviet autonomous republics immediately demanded territory from Turkey, causing the Turkish authorities to maintain a large army and dare not demobilize!</p>
<p>At the Potsdam Conference, the Soviet Union formally proposed the demand for joint defense of the Dardanelles Straits. It based this on the principle of "international equality." Here, the so-called international referred to the three great powers of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, and not to other countries. At the conference table, Stalin pointed to Churchill and said, "The Suez Canal is a vital waterway for your survival, and you have occupied and defended it." Then he pointed to Truman and said, "The Panama Canal is a vital waterway for your survival, and you have occupied and defended it; therefore, according to the principle of international equality, the Soviet Union has the right to demand the defense of the Black Sea Straits." Britain and the United States unanimously opposed this demand and advocated international control. Churchill said at the time: "If the straits become a Soviet naval base, only Russian ships will come out, and no British ships will go in!"</p>
<h3 id="e154">The Northern Bear Is Obsessed with the Ocean <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>In addition to fulfilling historical desires, the British and Americans have a new observation regarding the Soviet Union's obsession with controlling the straits, which is that the Soviet Union has developed a very deep interest in the ocean. By the Yalta Conference, Byrnes had already sensed this. Subsequent developments confirmed this. In the East, the Soviet Union had already acquired the Lushun naval base—the Gibraltar of the Yellow Sea. In the West, the Soviet Union supported Yugoslavia in acquiring ports on the Adriatic Sea. The port of Trieste is an important Central European seaport, and the shipbuilding facilities and skilled workers there could be utilized. Regarding Italy, it demanded one-third of the fleet and naval bases in North Africa. It was expected that it would demand a large portion of warships, merchant ships, and fishing boats from Japan as reparations. Joint control of the Black Sea Straits would allow the Soviet Union to become a Mediterranean power, developing its influence in Africa and the Near East. The Northern Bear also wanted to control the ocean, which, of course, conflicted with the interests of Britain and the United States, who regarded the ocean as their lifeline. In addition to other important political and military reasons, this is one of the motivations for Britain and the United States' firm support for Turkey.</p>

<h3 id="e155">Crimes of Japanese War Criminals - From Our News Data Room - The Poisonous Executioner: Konoe Fumimaro <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>When the name of Konoe Fumimaro, the chief culprit of the invasion of China, is mentioned, all Chinese people gnash their teeth with hatred. Although he is dead, how can we allow such a vicious executioner to "die and be done with"?</p>
<p>Konoe's latent power in Japan was considerable: He was born in 1891 and raised under the care of Prince Saionji. He had attended the Paris Peace Conference with Saionji and had long inherited Saionji's mantle, joining the ranks of Japanese "elder statesmen." He organized organizations such as the Toyo Society and the Nanyo Society, secretly preparing to launch a war of aggression against China. After Hayashi Senjūrō stepped down, Konoe rose to form a cabinet and launched the "North China Incident" upon taking office, mobilizing three divisions and over a hundred aircraft to attack Peiping and Tianjin. On the one hand, he flaunted the so-called "Konoe Three Principles" and the "policy of non-expansion," causing incalculable losses to the Chinese army and people. However, his conspiracy was finally exposed under the guidance of our wise supreme leader in the War of Resistance. Following this, there was the so-called "Konoe Statement," which put forward the slogans of the "Greater East Asia New Order" and "long-term warfare," all of which were thoroughly refuted by our authorities, forcing him to announce the collapse of his cabinet.</p>
<p>In June 1940, seeing Germany's military successes in Europe, Konoe took office again to form a cabinet, completing the proud masterpiece of the "Japan-Germany-Italy Military Alliance." After the outbreak of the Soviet-German War, Matsuoka Yōsuke was dismissed, and the Konoe cabinet was reorganized, even more recklessly pursuing militarism, and the arrogance of the warlords was unparalleled. After Hiranuma Kiichirō was assassinated, Konoe's third cabinet collapsed again.</p>
<p>In summary, from his rise to his fall, he formed a cabinet three times. His first cabinet led to the Sino-Japanese War; his second cabinet colluded with Germany and Italy, leading to international isolation; after his third cabinet failed, Tōjō Hideki came to power, leading to the Pacific War.</p>
<p>Please see the following excerpt from Konoe's conversation with Wang Jingwei: "The Japanese government has repeatedly declared in its statements this year that it will thoroughly eliminate the anti-Japanese National Government by force, and at the same time is willing to work hand in hand with enlightened Chinese people to move toward the construction of the East Asian New Order. Japan, Manchukuo, and China will jointly realize good neighborly friendship, joint anti-communism, and economic cooperation." The Chinese people suffered greatly under Wang Jingwei's tyranny, much of which was Konoe's "achievement."</p>
<p>After the victory, Konoe suddenly appeared in a pro-British and pro-American posture, frequently courting the Allied forces, and promoted constitutional amendments, hoping to emerge again to form a cabinet. He even fantasized about coming to China to "apologize." But this could not cover up his heinous crimes. On December 6th of last year, Konoe was "at the top of the list" of war criminals to be arrested by MacArthur. Finally, on the morning of the 16th of that month, he committed suicide by taking poison, leaving behind a will that continued to make excuses, claiming: "In due time, there will be public opinion on right and wrong!" He can be said to have been unrepentant until his death.</p>
<h3 id="e156">Old Fascist: Hiranuma Kiichirō <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>Konoe's second cabinet collapsed because he could do nothing about the war expenses in China, the international atmosphere was bad, and the fascist military was dissatisfied. The one who succeeded him, shouldering the heavy responsibility of "creating a new order and maintaining permanent peace in East Asia," was Baron Hiranuma Kiichirō, who served as prime minister for only seven months.</p>
<p>Hiranuma was born in 1867 and graduated from the Law Faculty of Tokyo Imperial University. He served in the Ministry of Justice. In 1911, he was appreciated by Justice Minister Matsuda Masahisa and appointed Vice Minister of Justice. In 1912, he served as Prosecutor General of the Supreme Court for as long as eight years. In 1921, he was promoted to President of the Supreme Court. In 1923, when the Yamamoto cabinet was established, he served as Justice Minister, establishing an unshakable power in the judicial field. In 1924, he was appointed Privy Councilor, and in April of the following year, he was appointed Vice President of the Privy Council. In 1933, he served as President of the Privy Council.</p>
<p>Hiranuma was the leader of Japanese fascists. He founded the Shūyōdan (Cultivation Group), serving as its director, and in 1924, he founded the Kokuhonsha (National Foundation Society), serving as its president, advocating "Imperial Household Centralism" and publishing "Kokuhon" and "Kokuhon Shimbun." Its members included bureaucrats, military officials, nobles, and people from all walks of life. Suzuki Kisaburō, Tōgō Heihachirō, Gotō Shinpei, Araki Sadao, Koiso Kuniaki, Matsui Iwane, Kikuchi Takeo, and zaibatsu Ikeda Seihin, and bureaucrat scholar Yamakawa Kenjirō were all members of the society. He also collaborated with Araki Sadao, vigorously attacking the Seiyūkai, and tried several times to form a cabinet, but failed due to opposition.</p>
<p>In 1939, Hiranuma finally fulfilled his lifelong wish at the high age of 73, but within two months of taking office, he was heavily criticized from all sides. The cabinet became an appendage of the military, with no power to interfere in foreign policy, and everything was controlled by Army Minister Itagaki and Education Minister Araki. In August of the same year, he resigned. In 1940, he briefly served as Minister of the Interior, and later as Deputy Prime Minister. In 1945, he was reappointed President of the Privy Council.</p>
<p>On December 2nd of last year, Hiranuma was among the 59 war criminals ordered to be arrested by MacArthur. This 80-year-old fascist "meritorious official" was finally thrown into prison, awaiting trial by the International Tribunal.</p>
<h3 id="e157">Violent Black Dragon: Hashimoto Kingorō <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>Hashimoto Kingorō was originally a standard Japanese rōnin, but in the militaristic Japanese fascist government, he actually became a remarkable figure.</p>
<p>Hashimoto was the leader of the "Japan Youth Party" and the head of the "Black Dragon Society." He absurdly styled himself as a superior Nazi, once saying that "National Socialism and Fascism are like the stars and moon in the evening sky, which can only be adorned more clearly in the morning light of Great Japan." The famous writer John Gunther called him "the founder of the one-party idea, an extremely violent young military officer." Because of the support of his "Black Dragon Society" behind the scenes, he often lived in robbery, assassination, and espionage, creating his terrifying reputation.</p>
<p>When he served as an adjutant at the Turkish embassy in 1927, he was already obsessed with studying German and Italian Nazi politics. In 1936, due to the rise of his Youth Party, he formed a fascist government combining civil and military bureaucrats, and issued a declaration of the "Leaping Great Japan National System Outline" (also known as the Hashimoto Kingorō Declaration), shouting the slogans of "Emperor First" and "National Control and Management."</p>
<p>In 1937, he rejoined the army, commanding a fleet of warships to invade China, creating the horrific Nanjing Massacre, and directing the bombardment of the American gunboat "Panay" and the British gunboat "Ladybird." He authored numerous works, publishing articles in the "Taiyō Dai-Nippon" magazine and other publications, and giving public speeches. The book "The Inevitability of Reform," which has now been submitted to the International Tribunal as evidence, is his "masterpiece," revealing his immense joy when he drowned our soldiers in the Yangtze River, and his desire to drive out British and American forces in China to realize Japan's monopolistic plans. He also often used conspiracies to overthrow civil and military officials whom he considered to be "lacking in ambition." In 1940, he was also the founder of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association.</p>
<p>This lawless warlord has been tried in the Tokyo International Tribunal, and everyone hopes that this "Old Black Dragon" will be given the most severe punishment!</p>
<h3 id="e158">Isolated City in Northern Jiangsu: Hai'an <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>— Zhenjiang, 7th Dispatch, Wang Hanou</p>
<p>When the reporter and local merchants walked out of the earthen city of Hai'an, they saw large numbers of Communist leaflets and slogans scattered on the ground. Everyone was filled with fearful apprehension. According to one or two people with ulterior motives, they also saw militiamen secretly reconnoitering in the distant woods. Whether this was true or false, the fact that there was Communist activity as soon as one left the earthen city was indeed true. Moreover, before this, Hai'an had shown signs of being surrounded; at night, the sound of hand grenades and machine guns became a regularly performed rhythm. But the garrison and residents did not pay excessive attention to it, only calmly dealing with it with the word "calm," which is the only good way to deal with the Communist military strategy, and the only good way to adapt to the current environment. Because after the National Army opened the Tongyang Line, it needed some reorganization and deployment in preparation for the next phase of operations, and it did not extend northward. Each town along the highway did not have "satellite" strongholds. As soon as the Communist military launched a "counterattack," they immediately approached the city, and there was no better way than to resolutely defend it with deep trenches and high ramparts.</p>
<p>Neat fortifications</p>
<p>When the reporter was in the town, the bunkers and fortifications in the earthen city were built neatly. The 65th Division was stationed in the town, and everyone inside seemed to be engineers, able to work as plasterers. The brothers carried bricks and mixed mortar themselves to build bunkers. They lived in civilian homes, and each outpost had a short protective wall built in front of it. Obstacles were piled up on every street and alley, preparing for all street battles. These bricks and stones for building fortifications were dug up from road bricks in the back streets and alleys, wooden door panels were temporarily requisitioned from residents, and a small number of tile and wood craftsmen also participated in the work.</p>
<p>Grain storage and death defending</p>
<p>When Hai'an District Chief Wang Jingyi convened a meeting of citizens, he announced that the entire town's residents would collectively store 12,000 dan of grain in preparation for a month-long siege. Each guild would supervise each merchant, and each baojia chief would supervise each household, trying to search for and store grain until the quota of 12,000 shi was filled and the food supply was sufficient. When the reporter was in the town, the residents all received temporary passes, and went out of the city every day to buy rice and grass from nearby villages. The lowest price of new rice was once as low as 34,000 yuan, but soon rose again to 45,000 yuan per shi. Grass then rose to 89,000 yuan per dan, equal to the price of large wheat at 130 jin per shi. Many people chopped up old furniture for cooking fuel, which, although painful, was said to be more cost-effective than "buying at expensive prices."</p>
<p>Roads extend in all directions</p>
<p>The earthen city of Hai'an was built by the puppet army during the period of occupation, and cost a lot of civilian blood and sweat at that time. When the New Fourth Army "liberated" the area, because they felt that the area was "indispensable," this earthen city was not only not demolished, but also processed and repaired, until the Communist military withdrew from the town, it was intact. In addition, there were two moats inside and outside the city, which was fully suitable for the conditions of deep trenches and high ramparts. What "indispensable" relationship did Hai'an have? It is the transportation hub connecting the southeast, northwest, south road to Tong (zhou) Ru (gao), west road to Yang (zhou) Tai (county), east road to Peng (cha) Li (bao) into the sea, north road to Dong (tai) Yan (cheng), directly to Huai (yin) Hai (zhou), and all these lines can be reached by road these days. In short, Hai'an is the center of transportation. With it, one can control the overall situation. Without it, a large section of the highway line would be forced to be completely abandoned.</p>
<p>Democratic lawsuit</p>
<p>Han Guojun, the former governor of Jiangsu Province who was comparable to Wu Peifu during the War of Resistance, was born in the town. When the local area fell in 1930, Han took refuge in a northeast village. He was kidnapped by enemy troops sent to the village to force him to take a puppet post, but Han resolutely vowed his allegiance and was unyielding in the face of danger, eventually dying for his ideals. Han's style name was Zishi. The New Fourth Army's "Democratic Government" hypocritically renamed the town "Zishi County" to commemorate his labor, but because his daughter, Han Liuqi, was one of the local capitalists, she was also arrested and subjected to a "democratic lawsuit" when the struggle was launched this spring. It was not until the Battle of Northern Jiangsu was about to begin that she was released. Now Ms. Liuqi is also in the town presiding over the Joint Military-Civilian Affairs Office and the Chamber of Commerce, planning to restore local affairs.</p>
<p>Battle of Fengshan</p>
<p>Newspaper telegrams intensely report on Mount Lushan, but there is no Mount Lushan in Hai'an, nor is there a North Mount Lushan. It is probably a mistake for Fengshan in the northeast corner two miles away from the town. Fengshan is one of the three ponds and ten scenic spots in Hai'an. The scenery is beautiful and shaped like a phoenix. Climbing the peak can overlook the entire city. In order to control the war situation, both sides must swear to defend this high ground. Part of the temples on Fengshan were demolished by the Communist army, and the three ponds and ten scenic spots have already shown signs of incompleteness. The Communist military's method of destroying temples is indeed terrible. The Guangfu Temple in Hai'an is one of the 24 forests in Xiahe. The architecture is even more magnificent than the Jing'an Temple in Shanghai, and it was also torn apart by the Communist military. The "religious freedom" declared by the Communist military's "Democratic Government," I don't know where this statement went.</p>
<p>Residents waiting to be fed</p>
<p>Hai'an is currently an important place in the battle for North Jiangsu. The military and civilians are defending the city to the death. Although the offensive of the Communist military's 12 regiments has weakened and the situation has become looser, external transportation has not yet recovered, and all industries are in a state of suffocation. The citizens deal with war and life every day, and prices are surprisingly high. Since the National Army advanced to the present, they have not received any relief supplies. It was previously reported that the Jiangsu-Ningbo branch of the Relief Headquarters had 500 tons of flour shipped in, specifically to relieve the disaster areas of Jiang, Qu, and Hai, but the highway in the Qutang area was cut off, and it is temporarily difficult to transport it in. The general poor people are like "carp in a dried rut," looking forward with longing eyes.</p>
<h3 id="e159">The Common Disaster and Oppression of the Flood in Haizhou <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>— Special Dispatch from Haizhou by Our Newspaper, 3rd. Correspondent: Li Shangnong</p>
<p>Haizhou, in the past a remote corner, has become the heart of northern Jiangsu and the gateway to the coast since the opening of sea trade and the construction of the Longhai Railway. It is now a major hub for military, political, cultural, and economic activities in the Huaihai region. It boasts hundreds of miles of fertile fields producing soybeans and wheat in the front, vast salt fields in the rear, and the Tongyun Grand Port, a major hub for goods, attracting attention from both domestic and foreign sources.</p>
<p>Currently, all local military, political, cultural, and financial institutions are located in Xinpu, which is twelve Chinese miles from Haizhou City, resulting in unusually prosperous commerce. Land transportation includes the Longhai Railway, Qinghai Highway, and Huaihai Highway. Water transportation offers direct routes from Lianyungang to Shanghai, Qingdao, Guangdong, Dalian, Xiamen, and other places. The Yunyan River provides inland navigation to Qingjiang. Before the incident, the China National Aviation Corporation had an aviation station in Haizhou, with daily north-south flights landing to carry passengers and transport mail, making transportation quite convenient.</p>
<p>During March and April of spring, the refugees' only hope was that the Communist army would quickly withdraw from the Haizhou territory, allowing people to return home to harvest wheat. By the time the wheat turned yellow in May, refugees from the various counties of Haizhou had spontaneously organized homecoming teams to return home to harvest wheat. Unexpectedly, all the returning teams were driven back by the Communist army's guns and artillery, and the wheat they had planted was harvested and transported away by the Communist army.</p>
<p>The displaced refugees, seeing that the wheat had been reaped by the Communist army and their livelihood destroyed, although they received flour from the Relief Administration and local authorities made efforts to provide relief, it was a mere drop in the bucket. Everyone still suffered from hunger. Many refugees fled from Xinpu to the south of the Yangtze River to find a way out. There are still 44,706 refugees in Xinpu, which is more than one-half fewer than in the spring. These more than 40,000 refugees look forward to returning home every day, because autumn has already arrived, and they will soon need cotton clothes. If they cannot return home, it will be even harder to bear the cold and hunger.</p>
<p>Disrupting Transportation and Blocking Food Supplies</p>
<p>After occupying the county towns of Shu and Gan, the Communist army violated the ceasefire order in January, disrupting transportation and occupying Baitabu on the Longhai Railway, as well as westward locations. They forcibly conscripted young men, killed family members who evaded military service, and repeatedly attacked outposts outside Haizhou, such as Xinba and Zhangwu, as well as Gezhuang near the outskirts of Guanyun County, which was also frequently attacked by the Communist army.</p>
<p>Although the Communist army did not cease attacks on outposts surrounding Hai and Guan counties, the local militia, under the command of General Duan Linmao of the National Army, defended with composure. Each time the Communist army attacked, they suffered heavy blows. The National Army in Haizhou launched a movement to save one meal to provide relief to refugees in Hai and Xin, with the army and civilians loving each other like family, sincerely united to defend the Haizhou base of the Huaihai area. Seeing that Haizhou could not be captured, the Communist army strengthened its blockade policy. Because the grain-producing areas were occupied by them, what we defended was only the county towns of Dongguan and Xinpu, Lianyungang, and other suburban areas, with very little grain production. Since the food and fuel were blockaded by the Communist army, food prices soared, causing public panic about food, and other prices also rose.</p>
<p>Haizhou was blockaded by the Communist army on three sides, north, south, and west. Only the sea off Lianyungang to the east allowed for traffic in and out, with ships traveling to and from Qingdao, transporting cloth and sundries. If it were not for the seaport of Lianyungang, even breathing would have been suffocated.</p>
<p>Originally, there were 700 stores, companies, and salt businesses of various kinds in Xinpu, and commerce was very prosperous. After the city's new outskirts and the Longhai Railway were occupied and blockaded by the Communist army, commerce plummeted, and stores closed one after another. As commerce declined, industry also fell into decline. Other peddlers and small businesses were unable to operate due to the interruption of traffic. There were seven or eight thousand unemployed and idle people in Xinpu. Many unemployed and poor people did not have a single meal a day, and their faces were pale, filling the corners of the new city. Local government officials and school teachers, due to low salaries and high prices, mostly worked on empty stomachs, truly experiencing unspeakable suffering. The only people who lived happily were the uncaptured traitors, profiteers who made a fortune from the national crisis, and a few corrupt officials who profited from victory. The rest of the people lived in misery.</p>
<p>Digging Dikes and Releasing Water to Submerge Autumn Crops</p>
<p>Because the Communist army in the Huaihai area suffered defeats in the northern Jiangsu battles, they disregarded the lives of the people and dug up the dikes of the Shu and Yun canals. The waves surged, and floods flowed horizontally. Except for the mountainous areas, the entire territory of southeast Xuzhou and Haizhou became a swamp. The people's houses and livestock were washed away and drowned in large numbers. The half-ripe beans, sesame seeds, sweet potatoes, and other autumn crops in the fields were all submerged, with a flooded area of more than 300 square miles.</p>
<p>The Communist army in southern Shandong, intending to flood Haizhou City and Xinpu, also dug up the dikes of the Yi River in Linyi County, causing the river water to flow eastward and merge with the waters of the Shu and Yun rivers, overflowing into the Hai and Xin areas. The Wei River north of Xinpu was silted up for years, hindering drainage, resulting in water depths of several feet in the suburbs of Hai and Guan counties. The highway from Haizhou to Xinpu was cut off, and the Yangyu airfield was in danger of being submerged.</p>
<p>The local military and civilians in Xinpu were deeply concerned that the Yangyu airfield and streets would be flooded, so they joined forces on the 23rd and 24th to rush to build the Yanyan River embankment outside the Xinpu West Bridge and blocked several breaches in the airfield embankment. Under the scorching sun, the military and civilians worked hard, sweating like rain, showing no fatigue. Although the flood could not submerge Haizhou, the interruption of the food and fuel supply for hundreds of thousands of people in the Hai, Guan, and Lian areas is the most serious problem at present.</p>

<p>(1) Lingering Athlete's Foot</p>
<p>Ping Shun: I started working in a different place in the autumn of the 32nd year [of the Republic, i.e. 1943]. Because the place was humid, in the summer of the following year, my feet (lower legs) felt rough. I fried and ate machine-milled rice bran, and took "Sanyou Industrial Society Athlete's Foot Medicine," which slightly reduced the swelling. In July of last year, the swelling of my legs returned as before. At that time, due to economic reasons, I used a folk remedy of eating several catties of boiled light red beans, but it was not effective. May I ask: (1) What is this exactly? What is the cause of the disease? (2) What is the impact of athlete's foot on the body? (3) Are there any effective medicines and preventive methods?</p>
<p>[Answer by Medical Doctor Yu Xinen] If it is athlete's foot, it will harm the heart. Injecting Vitamin B1: Injection medicine is very effective. In addition, a urine test should be done to see if there is kidney disease.</p>
<p>(2) Eye Pain</p>
<p>Pan Xilai asks: My elder brother suffered from trachoma several years ago, and it occurs every spring and autumn. It starts at five o'clock in the morning and stops at twelve o'clock. It does not cause redness or swelling when it occurs. He has to take painkillers one hour in advance to stop the pain. It recurred this summer as before, and painkillers are also ineffective. (1) If this continues, is there any danger to the eyes? (2) Is eating chives the cause of the disease? (3) Is this disease hereditary? (4) Is there any medicine that can cure it completely?</p>
<p>[Answer by Medical Doctor Yu Xinen] You should go to an ophthalmologist for examination and treatment, and do not randomly take medicine.</p>
<p>(3) Bladder Prolapse</p>
<p>Xu Mingjin asks: I am 33 years old and work as a shop assistant. I suffer from a left bladder prolapse. It is painful when it is severe, but it returns to normal every morning after a good night's sleep. It recurs when I overwork. The pain is more severe after eating. It has been almost a year, and I don't know why. Because I live in a remote rural area, there is no good doctor to seek help from. Please give me a treatment method.</p>
<p>[Answer by Medical Doctor Yu Xinen] What you are suffering from is a small intestine hernia. Surgery is the radical cure. You can temporarily use a T-shaped belt to lift the scrotum, especially when working and walking.</p>
<h3 id="e161">Visiting the Father of the Three Suffering Sisters in Changshu, Gui Zhongfei <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>Living in Desperate Straits, Lonely and Helpless, It Is Truly Pitiable</p>
<p>Editor: My father, Gui Hong, alias Zhongfei, is 33 years old this year. He disappeared in the spring of the 30th year of the Republic [1941]. The reason is this: In January of the 26th year [1937], my mother died due to childbirth! In the autumn, because of the Japanese invasion, my father, grandmother, and I, along with my two younger sisters, fled to the countryside. Later, on a small boat, we lived a wandering life, having been to Gaoyou, Rugao, Nantong, Yancheng, and other places. I don't know when, perhaps in the autumn of the 29th year [1940], we arrived in the colorful Shanghai. This is heaven for the rich and hell for the poor. Three months after arriving in Shanghai, unfortunately, the three of us sisters all broke out with rashes. Beset by poverty and illness, and unable to find a job, my father spent every day borrowing money. Fortunately, our sisters' illness slightly improved. In order to reduce the burden on her beloved son, my grandmother returned to her hometown of Changshu, where the cost of living was relatively low. At that time, Changshu was still occupied by the Japanese. My father was afraid of being humiliated by the Japanese, so he stayed in Shanghai. At first, we still corresponded, but finally, one of my letters to my father was returned. I asked people to inquire, but it was in vain. Until now, it is still unknown whether he is alive or dead. Before I knew it, my father had been missing for a full five years! The three of us sisters lived a few years of childish life under the care of our grandmother, but heaven seemed particularly harsh to us. In the autumn of the year before last, it also took my grandmother away. The changes in our lives after my grandmother's death are beyond description. In short, our path to survival is almost over! I hope every day that my father can see the newspaper and return quickly to save his daughters from the depths of misery. At the same time, I also hope that kind people who know the whereabouts of my father will write to "Gui Mei, c/o Doctor Yi Mei, No. 47 Jiaotong Street, Changshu." I am a 16-year-old girl who just graduated from junior high school last year. Due to economic reasons, I did not continue my studies. My Chinese is not very good, so I would like to ask the editor to correct it and publish it as a favor. I respectfully wish you good health. Orphan Gui Mei, Fen and Rong together.</p>

<p>As the cost of living rises every month, the lives of salaried employees are increasingly strained. Housewives find it a great hassle to manage the diet. If you buy more side dishes, the expenses are too high, and if you buy less, it is not enough to eat. I think housewives of salaried employees in the current environment must be very troubled by the problem of buying side dishes. I will now try to draft a menu for this week, based on a family of four or five people, with daily side dish expenses of around 3,000 yuan, with three dishes and one soup. I hope this can serve as a reference for housewives:</p>

<h3 id="e165">The Position and Attitude of a Daughter-in-Law <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>— Li Ying</p>
<p>Our country is a land of etiquette with a splendid history of five thousand years. Ethical concepts have always existed with dignity. Parents love their children, children respect their elders, husbands and wives are harmonious, brothers are respectful and fraternal. Every family is very harmonious. However, often many families, after marrying a daughter-in-law, have estrangement and jealousy, turning the harmonious atmosphere into one full of gloom and resentment, so that the entire family is not happy. Why is this?</p>
<p>Our ancestors lived under a large family system. Even now, the large family system has not been eradicated. In cities, only men and women with newer ideas have broken free from the shackles and established small families. "Large" and "small" are not changes in the system, but rather a shift in the perspective of 20th-century life. In large families, being a daughter-in-law is the most difficult and unrewarding job. She is surrounded by in-laws and sisters-in-law. If her husband has many siblings, she becomes the target of everyone, often the subject of their jokes, the object of cold ridicule. And what about her? She can only endure. She knows that this is an inevitable stage in life, and a natural result of the old system. Apart from gaining a little comfort in front of her husband, or placing all her hopes on her children, she can only get through it by silently accepting her arranged fate. She believes, "Years of being a daughter-in-law, years of being a mother-in-law, and then years of being a great-grandmother." She knows what it is like to be a daughter-in-law, and what it is like to be a mother-in-law. After tasting enough of the daughter-in-law's experience, she treats her daughter-in-law the same way. Instead of saying treatment, it is more like revenge. Generation after generation cycles through, until the increasingly innovative next generation can no longer endure this kind of "endurance," then there is strife and resistance. Those who can be independent break away and form small families, but most who continue to muddle along naturally have an even worse environment.</p>
<p>After organizing a small family, her position is invisibly raised. Now she is not a daughter-in-law but a wife, or even a mother. She is no longer restrained. A wife is equal to her husband. In addition to appropriate service and consideration, she does not need excessive service and submission, and no one deliberately bullies her or makes things difficult for her. Of course, this kind of life is not without small flaws, such as when economic difficulties are felt, when there are guests and she is too busy to manage, when there are too many children to care for, etc. Having family together can at least help her a little, but compared to the benefits, it is ultimately not a big deal.</p>
<p>Now it is time to talk about attitude. In large families that cannot be avoided, elders should use forgiving, loving, and optimistic eyes, holding the spirit of not being foolish, not being hypocritical, and not being an overbearing head of the family. Moreover, children and grandchildren have their own blessings, so there is no need to be jealous or curse. And those who are daughters-in-law should always remember that they are their elders, and should be filial and respectful, understand the psychological abnormalities that exist in the elderly. And being together every day, what's the point of tearing each other apart? With the attitude that both sides take a step back, they will definitely be able to live harmoniously, peacefully, and happily.</p>
<p>Although, to this day, we really don't need to maintain the large family system.</p>
<h3 id="e166">Three Prohibitions in Child Rearing <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>— Yunyu</p>
<p>The following are three important things about child rearing that I hope mothers will pay special attention to:</p>
<p>(1) Do not let people kiss your child. Many people often like to kiss children because they love them. This is a very common thing, and most mothers do not pay attention to it. In fact, we know that when kissing, the air exhaled by each other will be inhaled into each other. If the person kissing the child has a disease, it can be easily transmitted. If you want your child to stay healthy, quickly prohibit people from kissing your child!</p>
<p>(2) Do not deceive or scare your child. Children are curious. When they encounter something they have never seen before, they will ask, "What is this?" "Why is it like this?" Mothers should tell their children the reason why. If you don't know, answer frankly that you don't know. You must never deceive them with lies, or even threaten them. If the questions raised by children are often deceived or threatened, then the child's mind will be full of falsehood and fear, and their curiosity will also decrease or even disappear. Think about it: If people have no curiosity, how can all science and technology be improved day by day? I hope all mothers pay extra attention.</p>
<p>(3) Do not let people touch your child's genitals. Many people often like to touch boys' genitals, and most mothers think this is unimportant. If this continues day after day, it can easily cause the child to masturbate when they grow up. Everyone knows the drawbacks of masturbation, so there is no need to elaborate. At the same time, children must also be absolutely prohibited from touching their own genitals.</p>
<h3 id="e167">The Key to Beauty - Protecting the Skin <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>— Qing</p>
<p>Often some women, although they have very slender figures, because the foundation on their faces is applied too thickly, do not show any luster of the skin when they smile, completely like a colored plaster statue, unable to express any expression. At this time, if someone sees it at a glance, they will definitely feel very uncomfortable and feel a kind of pity for their skin.</p>
<p>We can be sure that a woman's appearance first focuses on the face, and the beauty or ugliness of the face depends on whether her skin is bright and smooth. Speaking of this, maybe someone will ask a question again, how can a woman's skin maintain its luster and radiance?</p>
<p>To maintain the beauty of the skin, we must first be able to protect the skin, so that it does not suffer damage from external stimulation. Anything that contains a large amount of lead, as well as too little sleep, are the most likely to irritate the skin. Therefore, women who usually like to apply relatively thick foundation that contains a lot of lead often have rough skin and enlarged pores. A woman who suffers from insomnia or stays up late often has rough and dry skin, and that's the reason. Therefore, the first important thing to nourish the skin is to carefully protect the skin.</p>
<p>Secondly, keeping the skin clean is also a way to nourish the skin, so within the possible range, it is best to avoid contact with dirty and dusty places, because unclean things contain a toxin that can absorb the skin's oil and make it dry. If this is not possible, then after you come back from walking, use clean warm water and soap to wash away the dust on your face, which is also a remedy; but after washing away the dust, the original oil on your face also fades away with the soap, so at this time we should use some nutrients to nourish it, such as egg white, glycerin, and the juice of fruits such as apples, oranges, and tomatoes, which are all good raw materials for nourishing the skin. (The above-mentioned ingredients are best used before going to bed, replacing soap to remove dirt. After getting up the next morning, wash with water, and the skin will appear radiant and smooth.) In addition, when the weather is cold in winter, you can apply lipid-based cosmetics (cold cream) to the face to prevent the skin from cracking.</p>
<p>If a woman's facial skin has reached the point of being clean and delicate, then apply a thin layer of foundation to her skin to cover up excessive oil on the face and remedy the sallow complexion, and then apply a small amount of rouge on this thin layer of powder, which can make the skin show a vivid and healthy beauty.</p>

<p>— Translated by Cheng Zhi</p>
<p>(1) The Branch Roads of Life</p>
<p>When I was young, I often argued with my younger brothers, even quarreled, because we were all stubborn and did things our own way.</p>
<p>One day, Father took us to the train station to play. We saw a train speeding towards us from both sides, and at the same time, a freight train was also rushing westward.</p>
<p>"What do you think will happen if two trains travel towards each other on the same track?" Father asked us.</p>
<p>We widened our eyes, thinking a terrible crash was about to happen, but as we watched, the freight train switched onto a branch road, letting the passenger train speed by safely.</p>
<p>"Look, children!" Father explained, "People are like trains, we are all moving in different directions on the same track. If there were no branch road facilities, there would be rifts between people, just like a train crash. Fortunately, we have many such facilities, such as patience, friendship, and tolerance. Therefore, between children, between adults, and even between countries, if they can always remember the branch roads in life, they will be more harmonious."</p>
<p>(2) Every Shot Counts</p>
<p>My father has allowed me to buy my first .22 caliber rifle. For many days, I have been flipping through the mail-order catalogs, and finally decided to choose a fully automatic one that fires fifteen rounds in succession. So I asked our bodyguard, Ping Jun, to agree to my choice, but he looked at the picture of the gun, then smiled and turned to me and said, "If I were you, I wouldn't want this one."</p>
<p>"Why?" I asked, suppressing my disappointment.</p>
<p>He said, "I think a single-shot is better. Every time you see this single-shot gun, you will think, if this shot doesn't hit, there will be no second chance. But, using an automatic is different, you no longer pay attention to the importance of each bullet, and as a result, you can't do the best you can."</p>
<p>Ping Jun's theory is indeed perfect. From then on, whether in career or in social life, I always think of his words, every shot counts.</p>
<p>(3) The Face and the Inside of the Watch</p>
<p>I remember one day when I was eleven years old, I returned home crying, because in the children's program at church, I was only assigned an insignificant backstage role. But my playmates were assigned the lead roles.</p>
<p>Mother quietly took out her watch and placed it in my hand.</p>
<p>"What do you see?" she asked me.</p>
<p>"The gold case face and the hands," I replied.</p>
<p>Then she opened the back of the watch and repeated the question. I now saw very small gears and screws.</p>
<p>"If any part is missing, even the ones you haven't seen yet, this watch is useless."</p>
<p>Her little lesson has made my life happier ever since, because I realize that everyone's work, even without others' admiration, is just as important.</p>

<h3 id="e169">Rossetti <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>— Pang Duoer</p>
<p>Dante Gabriel Rossetti was a poet and a painter. He dedicated his life to art, founded the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, and led poets and artists of the late Victorian era, such as William Morris, Burne-Jones, and Swinburne, to engage in independent creation. His paintings are as famous as his poems. However, it is more accurate to say that there is painting in his poems, rather than poetry in his paintings. Because the main point of his paintings is color and atmosphere, not the narrative of actions.</p>
<p>Rossetti's artistic talent stemmed from his lineage. His father was an Italian writer who sought refuge in London because of his revolutionary ideas. His mother was born from the combination of an Italian and an Englishman. Therefore, all four of the Rossetti siblings possessed Italian artistic talents, and all achieved considerable success in art; however, Dante Gabriel, as the eldest, enjoyed the greatest fame.</p>
<p>Rossetti was born in London on May 12, 1828. At that time, his home was a gathering place for Italian fugitives. From a young age, he witnessed the activities of political figures, which instead made him develop a distaste for politics. He even lacked enthusiasm for Italy's independence movement. His love for Italy was solely for its literature and art.</p>
<p>Rossetti entered art school at the age of fourteen and the Antique School of the Royal Academy at eighteen. In addition to painting, he also loved Browning's poetry. At this time, he began to understand medieval culture and society, and translated many Italian medieval poems and Dante's *Vita Nuova*. Published, it became Rossetti's first work, and also the standard English translation of early Italian poetry.</p>
<p>In 1848, Rossetti formally founded the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood with his friends Holman Hunt and Millais, advocating the restoration of the pure and simple style of Italian painters before Raphael. This was a reaction against the craftsmanship that valued skill and adhered to conventions at the time. Their conclusion was: Raphael's painting skills were too perfect, making it impossible for later generations to develop their own paths, thus causing art to decline. Therefore, to reform art, it is necessary to transcend skills and express the soul, and first return to the artistic atmosphere before Raphael, and then create freely in order to achieve results. In their paintings, the themes, colors, structures, and various details are all different from those of their contemporaries, and they do not seek to please the mundane world. The most obvious point is that they disdain the superficial harmony of colors, and only use basic, strong colors. They also expressed this spirit in poetry. Their publication, *The Germ*, contained Rossetti's most famous poem, "The Blessed Damozel".</p>
<p>At this time, Rossetti met a young girl, Elizabeth Siddall. She had a slender figure, blue-gray eyes, full lips, and golden hair, which met the conditions of a medieval beauty, causing Rossetti, who loved ancient beauty, to become infatuated. He used her as a model, painting famous works such as Beatrice. Eventually, Rossetti married her. However, his temperament was so eccentric and his life so irregular that she felt extremely lonely and soon contracted lung disease. One night, when Rossetti returned home, he found his wife dead in bed. In grief, he buried all his manuscripts of poetry from recent years with her to show his repentance. Many years later, he listened to the advice of friends and exhumed the manuscripts from the grave.</p>
<p>In 1854, Rossetti met the famous critic Ruskin. Ruskin greatly supported him, establishing his position in the art world. Subsequently, Morris, Burne-Jones, and others were all influenced by Rossetti and abandoned their studies to paint. Later writers also admired and imitated him. However, after losing his wife, he gradually felt unwell physically and mentally. At that time, Buchanan and others attacked his poems, saying that they focused too much on describing the senses of the five organs and were overly immersed in sensual pleasures. Their ridicule made him feel very embarrassed, but he continued to write until he died of a stroke in 1882 at the age of fifty-four.</p>
<p>His poems are all written in a very casual style and contain the same idea, that is, men love women, symbolizing God's love for humanity, and the loveliness of women symbolizes the beauty of the soul. He believed that "life" is "love," and "life" and "love" are the same thing, because "love" is the driving force of the universe, and without "love" there is no "life."

<p>— Zhang Baihuai</p>
<p>"One evening, I saw you with your head lowered in dejection, wandering on the green field paths. Later, I saw you enlarging your throat and singing fervently. Are you making an expectation, or are you doing some necessary search?"</p>
<p>"No, I'm just following my own high notes."</p>
<p>"Then I would like to feel melancholic for your song. Just like the adorable morning sun facing the lonely building window. But did you notice us walking past you from behind at that time? And she whispered, your eyes must be fascinated by some difficult thoughts."</p>
<p>"Fascinated, yes, but why did you just walk past like that?"</p>
<p>"You were pondering at the time, saying that you were standing on the ruins of time and wanted to use the golden bricks of love to rebuild the desolation you saw. But you hesitated between yesterday and tomorrow, fearing that you would only pick up a prosperous dream. She almost couldn't help but laugh, but we finally didn't disturb you."</p>
<p>"I really don't understand why I fear the paleness of the soul, even the emptiness of thought. In these days, have you also seen me wandering in the loneliness of the depths of my heart?"</p>
<p>"Lonely people have no love, and you, the fire of love has burned your life red."</p>
<p>"Alas, although I say that I understand the meaning of life more than before, I have not yet turned to such a difficult-to-understand and chaotic chapter in the book of emotion. I ask all my friends, but until now, no one has been able to comprehend it. They all say that the wordless sentences are too vague, hidden and difficult. So, I have been doubting for a long time, doubting that it describes an unfortunate child who once used weakness and tears, angrily but powerlessly throwing pain into the forest of languid fate…"</p>
<p>"You are too indulgent towards yourself, but now it is a terrible demand."</p>
<p>"But a poet told me this, he said: When you are unable to continue forward, you stand by the road and see the pedestrians. I think this is the real cruelty."</p>
<p>"This time you have trusted yourself too easily."</p>
<p>"No, no, am I really so ignorant of myself? I walk on a narrow valley path, and what grows beside it is not lush flowers and trees, but thorns and bushes. Walking in the four directions, front and back, are not pedestrians and travelers, but wild beasts and leopards…"</p>
<p>"That's because you no longer have the will to continue climbing the road you dreamed of!"</p>
<p>"I really haven't thought about wavering and retreating, but my passionate heart is so lonely."</p>
<p>"Then have you heard a poet say? His sorrow is also his joy at the same time, perhaps your pain is also your sublimity at the same time."</p>
<p>"Yes, it's better to comfort myself like that. I remember I secretly thought, if someone really wanted to take themselves apart for dissection, and before they started, they declared that the life being dissected had already died, as a review of the final existence, perhaps no one would be willing to be cruel and give him a severe spiritual reproach…"</p>
<p>"But, is this your whole being?"</p>
<p>"Alas, you must be surprised by my poverty. What I think is profound and what I express is superficial, perhaps because I have lost too much and gained too little!"</p>
<p>"I don't want to spend too much time exploring the secrets of your heart. You can be proud of the dirty pearls on your forehead, and not be ashamed that you have not done better for more people. Go, if ridicule and jealousy continue, you will mercilessly throw a cold heart at them with the hatred of truth!"</p>
<h3 id="e171">Heine's Tragic Life <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>— Li Xia</p>
<p>Heinrich Heine was a romantic and passionate poet, but his life was one of suffering and misfortune. Between the duality of contradictions, he endured hardships all his life and could not turn over. Material and spiritual, ideal and reality, love and hate, passion and coldness, self-esteem and disappointment, these two-headed snakes of contradiction constantly attacked him.</p>
<p>"My heart, my heart's sorrow.</p>
<p>Although illuminated by the clear May sunshine,</p>
<p>I wander and lean under the linden tree,</p>
<p>Beside that high old city.</p>
<p>My chest is surging like the sea,</p>
<p>There are also hurricanes and tides,</p>
<p>Although it is said that there are beautiful pearls,</p>
<p>But it is a deep seabed."</p>
<p>……Homecoming Memories</p>
<p>The above little poem reflects the poet's inner sorrow. The poet was born in 1797 in the city of Dusseldorf on the Rhine. The city was originally German territory, but at that time it belonged to French rule, so in his "Memorandum" he said:</p>
<p>"I was born at the end of the suspicious eighteenth century, and my childhood was not only French, but also born in a city dominated by the French spirit."</p>
<p>And as Jewish parents raising him, it was exactly two extreme forces. The mother was a diligent and practical woman with a German style. Because she had the mentality of making her son an official, she ordered him to study law. However, the father was a cheerful, hedonistic, and optimistic person with a French style, and did not give any effective facilities to the education of his son. In such an atmosphere, the poet Heine began his contradictory life.</p>
<p>Relying on his mother's will, the poet moved to Hamburg at the age of nineteen to engage in the study of law. For a time, he dreamed of becoming a lawyer or a school professor in the future, and he also spent three months of first love. In particular, the result of this three-month first love had to embark on the tragic of the fate. In fact, the other party admired by the poet did not hold any such feelings. The scars of this painful experience first cast a black shadow on his poems. In the first half of his first collection of poems, "Book of Songs", the tone of painful sorrow for the past nightmare is permeated.</p>
<p>When he left this "cradle of distress," Hamburg, it was in the summer of 1819. Because he received the assistance of his uncle, he entered the University of Bonn to study law. In Bonn, he made many friends in the student union with a high degree of patriotism. He saw the student union disbanded, and he participated in the grand victory memorial festival of Carl Ludwig Sand, so the thought of resistance struggle gradually became extremely in his mind.</p>
<p>In the spring of 1821, he began to live in Berlin. In this prosperous metropolis, he was more deeply affected by both the bright and dark sides. But the problem that he felt particularly painful here was the concept of racial discrimination. As a Jew who was repeatedly subjected to embarrassing contempt, he expressed his anger and aversion in everything. Here, he gradually strengthened his anti-resistance atmosphere, and finally participated in the "Jewish Cultural Science Association", wrote articles, and even carried out his propaganda activities everywhere.</p>
<p>In 1825, he finally passed that annoying graduation exam and got a doctorate. And with the help of his uncle, he went to the North Sea again. The sea is what the poet especially likes. Due to the guidance of the sea, he finally crossed the sea to England. The sea gradually led him to the embrace of nature, promoting the wanderlust of this born wanderer. As a result of his roaming, he wrote masterpieces such as "The North Sea" and "Harz Journey", and published the work "Book of Songs" in 1827, which established his poet's reputation.</p>
<p>But the ideological and political opinions expressed in the collection of poems aroused opposition and attacks from backward forces everywhere. Even some parts were banned from sale by the Prussian government, and the pressure of disillusionment and misfortune gradually increased around him. So the poet arrived in Paris, France in May 1831.</p>
<p>The first impression in Paris was very strong and fresh. The nostalgia for Raf Antiero, Rousseau, Napoleon, and all other great French past was surging in his chest like a tide. It is even more interesting than everything else is the new religious theory of Saint-Simon. This theory enabled him to find a mediation between the democratic views he had always held and the emerging aristocratic artisticism. This theory advocates abolishing the old inequality, and replacing it is the expectation of a new class built by the ability of personality without following the tradition. At the same time, due to the love and cohabitation of Mathilde, a twenty-year-old girl, his passion burned even more, so that he could regard the suffering of the people as his own suffering, and take the people's social progress as his urgent vanguard.</p>
<p>"I am a sword, I am a flame. Please put a sword on my coffin. I am a brave warrior in the human war of freedom."</p>
<p>He was shouting like this, although he was rejected by the Parisians. However, he finally stood up as a savior of his motherland, and stood up as a supporter of the people.</p>
<p>But Heine was ultimately a "art for art's sake" poet. Because he was born with sensitivity, the degree of his love and hatred often had to go beyond the norm. So the poet's later poems replaced the happiness he had previously gained in poetry with ridicule and humor.</p>
<p>After 1842, he had a severe attack of chronic disease, which eroded and numbed the poet's hands, feet, and even eyelids. The later life of the hemiplegic poet became even more bleak. But precisely because of the disease, he had more time to fantasize, and finally wrote a narrative poem. After eight years of long suffering on the sickbed, he finally ended this "defeated" life on the morning of February 17, 1856.</p>

<p>— Chen Ji</p>
<p>A young cypress tree, standing with its broad chest, stood in the boundless vast grassland, shaking its upper body and laughing freely all day long, singing heartily. All he saw was the happy blue sky and the happy white clouds.</p>
<p>One evening, the purple twilight shrouded the grassland, and the sun shed its haggard yellow hair. A piece of darkness swept over the branches of the pomelo tree, and the young singer felt melancholy. At this time, a large eagle flew over, flapped its wings and rested on the branches of the pomelo tree, with fresh red blood still dripping from its chest. It was dark, and the eagle cried sadly in the bleak night wind.</p>
<p>"Hey, is there anything in the world that hurts you?"</p>
<p>"In the world, oh friend, there are too many sorrows for wanderers in the world, and too many conspiracies for cruel people. They are jealous of me flying freely, and secretly, they aim their guns at me…"</p>
<p>"Don't people love freedom and happiness?"</p>
<p>"Oh friend, people want to kill freedom and happiness!…"</p>
<p>The next morning, the pomelo tree looked up to sing to the rising sun, but the sun did not come out, and the sky was full of gray clouds. The eagle fell from the tree like a stone, lying on its back at the foot of the pomelo tree. From then on, the eagle closed its bright eyes and no longer flew high, and the pomelo tree also lowered its head and became mute.</p>
<p>Again in the evening, a fat city merchant came and ordered two people to saw off the young pomelo tree. In its own panicked shouts, the pomelo tree broke its upper body and fell on the grassland. So the workers carried the tree and picked up the eagle and took them to the city to sell them. And the grassland was empty, losing its young singer!</p>
<p>Days went by, seasons changed, and rain and snow constantly washed over the grassland, leaving no wood chips from the tree or bloodstains from the eagle!</p>
<p>Wait for the roots of the pomelo tree to grow branches and stems again, and the era will be newly changed!</p>

<p>— Ye Jingfeng 35</p>
<p>This special agent leader in Beiping seemed quite shrewd, but unfortunately he encountered a troublesome problem at this time, and he was pacing around there, unable to handle it, and he was so distracted. His way of dealing with me was very similar to that of the "pig" deputy captain, offering as much high-quality tobacco, alcohol, and food as possible.</p>
<p>"Based on my humble opinion, your Excellency's tour is probably nothing more than the issue of the deputy captain of the Third Team of the 131st Liaison?" He wanted to get my tone with some tipsiness and cunning. He used the word "Your Excellency" because the identity I fabricated was equal to his.</p>
<p>Who is the deputy captain of the Third Team of the 131st Liaison? You probably still remember the "pig" who was killed by Little Tiger using grappling techniques to pull out his throat. The matter was only twenty-odd hours apart, and that scene was still active in my memory, of course. But I was surprised when he suddenly mentioned it to me.</p>
<p>"What's going on?" I pretended to be a little drunk and as if I knew it all along.</p>
<p>"This matter was allocated by the headquarters. Your Excellency came from the headquarters, don't you understand? …Perhaps you look down on me, because my position is very ordinary, so you are not willing to confide in me." He put on a close and very flattering look.</p>
<p>"The matter happened in your area. I started from Fengtian. The fastest trip would take one or two days. I'm afraid I wouldn't have received the news so quickly!" I was still vague, but I paid close attention to his expression.</p>
<p>"Although it is slow to come from Fengtian, can't you take a plane? Besides, with my humble eyes, I can determine that your Excellency must have come from Tianjin. The headquarters must have telegraphed your Excellency. This is still just a guess. In fact, the small intelligence of our area notified us of your Excellency's arrival early." He said, giving a fake laugh, but he was afraid of being too presumptuous, so the fake laugh stopped halfway and he apologized repeatedly.</p>
<p>"I have heard some rumors about the matter," I said, putting on a serious face, since he insisted that I was a commissioner sent by the headquarters to investigate the case: "I still need your Excellency to explain the whole case from beginning to end, so that I can decide what to do next, because the matter has been reported to the headquarters, it's always a bit troublesome, and it's also your Excellency's responsibility!" I took the opportunity to scare him and at the same time decided to take advantage of the opportunity.</p>
<p>"Regarding the case, I received an order from the marching headquarters of the 106th Division this morning, saying that Kiyono Shiro, a deputy captain of the Third Team of the 131st Liaison, and a driver from the same team, have disappeared at the same time." This guy was indeed scared, and immediately put away his smile. "I immediately ran to the Third Team's garrison to investigate in person. According to the clues reported by several people present in the Third Team, and together with a military intelligence officer from the 131st Liaison, we tracked down the missing vehicle. Then we found two bodies drowned in the water, which were the missing persons themselves."</p>
<p>"Isn't that murder?" I deliberately speculated to see if he wanted to muddle through the matter casually, or if he wanted to get to the bottom of it. "Are there any injuries—such as knife wounds or gunshot wounds?"</p>
<p>"It looks like a murder. The injuries…are…" He rolled his eyes and paused for a moment, "Because the bodies were swollen…"</p>
<p>"Murder must have a mastermind, so who is the mastermind?" I knew he hadn't paid attention to the injuries, so I was eager to know their relationship with me and Little Tiger.</p>
<p>"The difficulty lies in this point. It is said that the deputy captain was ordered to escort two senior officials sent by the headquarters to Beiping to handle important business; one of them is a special agent from Manchuria, a young man only twenty years old."</p>
<p>"Maybe these two are the masterminds?" I deliberately pressed forward.</p>
<p>"In fact, it is probably impossible, because the deputy captain made it very clear in front of his headquarters subordinates and soldiers; he said that they were two distinguished guests, one was a special commissioner from the headquarters, and also his classmate and old friend…"</p>
<p>"So, the bodies of these two distinguished guests…oh, haven't their traces been found?"</p>

<p>Since the investigative teams have gone to work in various places, there is hardly a place where problems have not been found. We hear about these endless corruption scandals every day, and besides feeling sad, we also feel suffocated. What conclusion will be drawn from this phenomenon is self-evident; it is extremely dangerous!</p>
<p>Some people regard the investigative teams as plain tea teams, as something light and bland, thinking they are merely helping to stir up conversation. Although the investigative teams in various places are working fairly and earnestly, such as Mr. Liu Wendao having the courage to catch tigers, and Mr. Qian Gonglai having the determination to receive tears, they really cannot investigate everything, and there are too many people involved. When the deadline arrives, they are handed over to ×× to continue handling and finishing the matter.</p>
<p>After careful study, the main obstacle to the investigative work in various places so far is "no original inventory list." Without the original inventory list, how can one investigate whether the takeover conforms to the records? However, as far as we know, every enemy-puppet organization, factory, or school at the time had an original inventory list, especially the Japanese. They knew about future compensation issues, and that these transferred materials would be used to offset the compensation, so they would never be sloppy in the slightest. As for the puppet organizations, they were naturally terrified and hoped to be pardoned for their efforts in safekeeping, so they made everything clear. In this situation, if there is no original inventory list, we dare to assert that there must be doubts. Therefore, the investigative team can sell what is turned over, but cannot lightly gloss over it with this reason.</p>
<p>It has been a full year, and we are still wallowing in taking over, handling, and investigating, in a chaotic and dizzying state, which is really disheartening.</p>

<p>— Yang Yongzhang</p>
<p>A mouse, even if it doesn't die in the claws of a cat, its lifespan is only three or four years. If you can prove that there is a mouse in the world that has indeed lived for ten years, you will immediately be surrounded by many scientists studying the problem of life. A ten-year-old mouse is undoubtedly considered long-lived; but if the dead person in the small coffin also happens to be ten years old, no one but a madman would say that he is long-lived. This suggests to us that longevity does not only refer to the length of years, because this has a great relationship with the species of the animal. The standards for humans and mice are certainly different, and even among humans, they are not the same. Leaving aside other things, it is said that the lifespan of the yellow race is relatively short. Japanese statistics show that only about 150 out of every thousand people can enjoy a lifespan of seventy years, but there are indeed many long-lived people in countries such as Bulgaria, Finland, and Norway. This has a considerable relationship with geographical conditions (such as climate and temperature); at the same time, they all pay attention to personal hygiene. Physical health preservation can certainly affect lifespan, and psychological changes, personal outlook on life, and lifestyle are all related to lifespan.</p>
<p>In addition to individual conditions, heredity is also important. "Like father, like son." There was a centenarian in Burgen who was 160 years old, and his son was already 103 years old. In a court in a certain place in the United States, in order to resolve a lawsuit, witnesses were summoned. He brought two sons with him, the older one was 102 years old, and the younger one was already 100 years old. His own age is self-evident. In a Vienna nursing home, doctors investigated 700 elderly people who were already eighty years old and learned that the parents of these elderly people were also mostly over seventy years old. Now I tell you that if your father can live to be ninety years old, you may (not necessarily) also be a centenarian in the future.</p>
<p>On the death certificates of patients, doctors write those terrible disease names, but medical scientists are eagerly hoping for the day when medicine can not only treat diseases, but also make further progress in preventing diseases, because diseases often destroy people's lives, making them unable to live long. Although doctors cannot create life, if people are not attacked by diseases, longevity can be obtained without effort.</p>
<p>Bacteriologist Metchmikoff believed that the bacteria in the human large intestine are the main cause of "short life." You may want to find a way to kill all the bacteria in the intestine to ensure longevity, but in fact this is fundamentally impossible. The bacteria in the large intestine are an indispensable medium for digestive function, and there is no way to remove the bacteria, but at least maintaining the health of the stomach and intestines can make people healthy. The reason why vegetarians live longer is because fermentation is less likely to occur in the intestines (meat is more likely than vegetables).</p>
<p>Nutrition can also affect longevity. Do you think a malnourished person will live long?</p>
<p>Some people argue that the weight of the brain is also related to lifespan, the heavier the longer, but this cannot be proven yet.</p>
<p>Longevity, longevity, people all hope for longevity, but in fact, I think too much longevity loses the tension and fun of life. Imagine if everyone could live to be a thousand years old, this world would probably be even worse.</p>
<p>I do not seek longevity, I only hope to strive to create my own fulfilling life in a short period of time.</p>

<p>— Wen Zongkong</p>
<p>Literary plagiarism was discovered in ancient times, but it mostly belonged to poets. They occasionally extracted one or two good lines from the poems of their predecessors to make their own works more colorful. The purpose was to steal some fame, and there was no idea of profit. For example, He Xun's poem "Thin clouds emerge at the edge, the first moon crosses the middle." Du Fu changed four words, "Thin clouds rest at the strict edge, the lonely moon turns in the waves," and it became a Du Fu poem. Also, Lin Bu's poem "Bamboo shadows slant across the shallow clear water, osmanthus fragrance floats in the yellow dusk moon." Changed "bamboo" to "sparse" and "osmanthus" to "dark," and it became his plum blossom poem.</p>
<p>But today, the trend of plagiarism is flourishing, and there is a distinction between open and smuggled. The former is like the "Digest" publications published on the market. They have only two purposes: (1) Because readers cannot easily see all the good articles, they implement a wide search and selection, collecting and publishing them to facilitate readers' reading. (2) Because of this, their expenditure on manuscript fees can be saved.</p>
<p>Often, there are some degenerate writers who, under the threat of life, feel that it is difficult for their substandard articles to be accepted and published by editors in general newspapers and magazines, so they have to take risks and use despicable brains. They flip through better articles that have been published elsewhere several years ago, or some humorous translations from obscure magazines, change their appearance, copy them well, and send them to the newspaper office. Such manuscripts are naturally easy to publish, so they can wait quietly for the manuscript fee.</p>
<p>However, the editor who is in the position of a gardener, although he cherishes his own garden very much, it is difficult for him to meticulously identify the complicated seeds sent from various farms with his limited power and time. Therefore, it is not until the arrival of tourists that they will point out that this is an unworthy weed, and that is a flower that has mutated!</p>
<p>In the garden of Free Talk on the tenth of this month, a Mr. Huai Yizi also discovered during a visit that the article "Intelligence and Fool" published on August 1 under the name of "Ling Zhuoyan" was plagiarized from the article "Intelligent People and Fools" by Mr. Danxin on page 124 of the "Tide" series published on June 12, 1944. I think this person is very bold, but what is interesting is that the title of the exposed article happens to be "Intelligence and Fool". Is it that the God of Literature is playing tricks on the literary plagiarist in the dark, saying that he has turned from an intelligent person into a fool?</p>
<p>After reading the exposure of plagiarism published by the "Editorial Office," the plagiarist is miserable enough. Under such circumstances, it seems unkind to us to "not talk about their shortcomings" behind their backs, but considering this precious inch of land, in order to protect the growth of good crops and to take care of the gardener's energy, we, a group of visitors to the garden, have to grit our teeth, release our sharp eyes, and assist the editor to remove the tares that mix fish eyes with pearls, so that we can get a good harvest in the future!</p>

In fact, who is the sheep that produces the wool? Isn't it the Chinese people? Isn't the wool that foreigners allow to be given to the city government taken from the Chinese sheep? At the same time, foreigners have taken away even more wool. This statement is accurate only if it comes from foreigners. Mayor Wu's calculation has been beaten by foreign merchants. We, the onlookers, are clear. This is the key to Mayor Wu's political reputation. If I were Mayor Wu's brain trust, I would advise Mayor Wu to follow the resolution of the Senate, which is the best policy. If we add persuasion, it is the worst policy. If we can oppose it, it is the best policy. If we say that we will buy it in two years, who can guarantee it? At the end of last year, 5,000 yuan of legal tender could buy a dan of good white rice, but now we cannot buy a dou of good rice. It is better to gather investment now or jointly operate beneficial businesses with Chinese and foreign parties on this huge base. I think it is better to refuse them outright than to take their money after they have run away and then prohibit them from running away?</p>
<p>Two points: First, who pays the bill? Second, who can guarantee what will happen in two years? Dear Mayor, respect the opinions of the people! The people will support you!</p>
<h3 id="e181">The Principal's Wishful Thinking <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>— Changpu</p>
<p>Yesterday, my friend Mr. Zhang came to visit. Because we are both in the education field, the topic was inseparable from our profession, and then we talked about the issue of teachers' advancement and retreat. He told me a scandalous thing that made me have to record it so that readers know that there is such a ridiculous thing in the world.</p>
<p>The thing is like this: On August 25, Mr. Zhang saw an advertisement in the newspaper that a certain elementary school in Pudong planned to hire several male and female teachers. He sent his resume. Two days later, he received a letter asking him to go to a certain elementary school on Daxi Road on the morning of the 29th for an interview and trial teaching. He thought that things must be slightly hopeful, but he did not know that when he went to the school that morning, it turned out to be a simple Weitang elementary school with only sixty or seventy students. The principal also served as the bell ringer, the school worker, the student who carried the organ, and the one who made boiled water, and also did chores. The principal was full of airs and showed an indifferent attitude, which made Mr. Zhang suspicious. Later, he was asked to teach several hours of classes that day, without water to drink, and he was exhausted and his mouth was dry before he was allowed to go back. He was told temporarily that whether he was hired or not, he would definitely receive a reply the next day, but Mr. Zhang waited five or six days after returning home, and there was no news at all. Knowing that he had been fooled, he had spent his own money and taught for him in the hot weather, "losing his wife and losing his army." It turned out that the shrewd principal was afraid that the students would not be able to stay if school started late, so he started classes early; but he did not want the old teachers to be paid from August, so he came up with this method. To put it nicely, it was asking new teachers to try out teaching, but in fact, it was saving himself the expense of salaries for August.</p>
<p>All of this is truly speechless.</p>
<p>News Figures</p>
<h3 id="e182">Liu Wendao, Head of the Fujian-Taiwan Investigative Team, Goes to Taiwan to Fight Tigers <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>— Jun Mo</p>
<p>Liu Wendao, head of the Fujian-Taiwan Takeover Work Investigative Team, arrived in Taiwan and hosted reporters on the 12th, saying, "We have come to Taiwan this time to fight tigers, not to swat flies."</p>
<p>People who have met Liu Wendao can believe that he can fight a few tigers: tall stature, strong build, square head and big ears, although he always seems to have a smiling face, he doesn't talk much, making it difficult to guess what he wants to do.</p>
<p>Military Background</p>
<p>This is a politician with a military background. Half of his life's work has been spent in his hometown of Hubei, and Liu Wendao has a particularly long relationship with Hankou; the other half has been spent abroad—Germany and Italy. After graduating from Baoding Military Academy, he, like many of his classmates, went to Japan, but he always seemed to have little interest in leading troops, so he soon went to France to study law at the University of Paris. When he returned to China, it was just as the Northern Expedition was unfolding; he, a young man in his thirties who had studied military affairs and then turned to the path of law, served as the director of the political department of the Forward Headquarters of the National Revolutionary Army. After the Northern Expeditionary Army occupied Hankou, he took office as the mayor of this city, which is the hub of north and south. At that time, Hankou, which had been occupied by warlords for a long time, was still in a mess, especially because Hankou had special zones and French and Japanese concessions, which made governance even more difficult. Taking transportation as an example, the rickshaws in Hankou could not be pulled into the special zones and concessions, and the rickshaws in the special zones and concessions could not be pulled out. This matter caused a lot of difficulties in transportation. After Liu's many negotiations with the concession authorities, the "military passage" between the two sides was finally successful. But unexpectedly, this small "international negotiation" was precisely the beginning of his long diplomatic career.</p>
<p>Once Envoy to Germany</p>
<p>In the 20th year of the Republic, Liu served as the minister to Germany; later, he was transferred to the minister to Italy. In the years before the war, the relationship between China and Italy was quite good, especially in aviation. There was a lot of cooperation in aircraft and flight training. At that time, most of the foreign instructors at the Central Aviation School at Jianqiao in Hangzhou were Italians. Liu made great contributions to the work in aviation cooperation. However, in the 26th year, when the August 13th Incident broke out, these ungrateful Italian instructors sat in Japanese bombers and bombed the Hangzhou fire station into an empty shell, which Liu could not have foreseen at the beginning!</p>
<p>Quite Humorous</p>
<p>Liu Wendao is quite humorous, but he is not willing to be lenient. When he was the mayor of Hankou, there was a very famous geomancer named Ding Shouyang who had been in Hankou for more than 20 years. He specialized in looking at the feng shui of tombs, and it was said that he was always accurate. A director in the city government admired him so much that he introduced him to the mayor's residence to find a good burial place for the ancestral tomb. This feng shui master boasted in front of Liu Wendao that after looking at this tomb, he would definitely be rich and prosperous for generations to come. Liu remained silent. After he finished speaking, after a long time, he slowly asked, "Since that's the case, why don't you find one for yourself first?" He drove the geomancer, who had been poured a bucket of cold water, out of the gate.</p>
<p>This was naturally just swatting a fly, but Liu is now going to see the feng shui of Taiwan for himself, and he will probably be able to pull a similar cold face and beat a few tigers back!</p>
