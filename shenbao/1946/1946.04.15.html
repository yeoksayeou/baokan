<h3>防守司令昨晨就職　長春宣布臨時戒嚴　近郊三處戰事進行中</h3>
<p>〔中央社長春十四日電〕長春防守司令陳家珍，副司令劉德摩，十四日上午十時正式就職，同時寫布接收長春全市防務，並立即張貼布告，宣布於十四日上午十時起，長春區臨時戒嚴，戒嚴期間執行下列事項：（一）暫時停止集會結社。（二）檢査新聞，郵件，電報及出版物。（三）除正規軍警及經防守司令部特許者外，禁止挑帶或收藏武器。（四）檢査旅館，公衆出入塲所及認爲可疑之私人住宅。（五）必要時實行街頭檢査。（六）每日下午六時起至翌日上午七時止，除正規軍警及持有防守司令部所發之通行證者外，一律禁止通行。（七）非經許可，一律禁止搬運大宗食糧及一切有關軍事之物資。下午三時陳家珍少將，首次招待中外記者，據稱：包圍長春之共軍，的三萬人，渠感覺長春周圍所受共軍壓力甚重，但渠表示決盡力保衛此已爲政府接收之城市，晚七時陳氏將向市民發表廣播演說，宣布保衛長春之決心。</p>
<p>〔中央社長春十四日電〕蘇軍最後撤退之今日，長春市郊三處，發生戰事，其中一處在西南言七公里家屯，該處係於今晨四時半遭共軍攻擊，四小時後即被當地守軍擊退。另一處在飛機塲附近之桑家窩舖，據官方稱，該處約有共軍二千五百至三千人，分三路向飛機塲進攻，戰况頗爲緊張，經駐防郊區之保安第四總隊第十三團派隊馳援，共軍之攻勢稍殺，至十時正雙方已呈對峙狀態。又一處在市區至飛機塲中途之綠園附近，該處戰事現正進行中，此外委城子附近之市警察第六分局，是晚已被共軍佔領，該處距畏春市甚近，已構成對長春之最大成脅。</p>
<p>〔又電〕十四日上午飛機塲附近之戰事，經四小時半之對峙，於下午三時半重趨激烈。五時，共軍已迫近機場邊沿，並有砲彈多枚一落於塲內，本日有飛機一架由瀋飛哈，該機原定午前於此間降落然後飛哈，當該機飛臨時，以機塲附近正有戰事，乃直接飛哈。下午三時，該機由哈歸來，曾於戰事停止之暫時間內，在機塲降落，甫行着地，戰事又起，該機遂起飛返瀋。按我機飛哈，此爲十四年來之首次。</p>
<h3>佔領長春二百廿八天　卡洛夫率部北撤　蘇軍戰時統治已完全消除</h3>
<p>〔中央社長春十四日電〕蘇軍城防司令卡洛夫少將十四日晨十時二十分，率其司令部人員及最後一批蘇軍登車北撤，蘇軍所加於長春之戰時統治，至是已完全消除。自本日起，長春市眞正獲得解放，我軍正式接管全市防務，市政亦不再受外力干涉，按蘇軍係於去秋八月十九日進入長春，迄今共歷時二百二十八天。卡浴夭本日率部離長春時，我國軍事代表團團員兼長春防守司令陳家珍少將曾到站歡送，兩氏原約定十四日上午九時晤談，臨時取消，改於車站相晤，開車前三分鐘，中蘇送行人員在車上共同舉杯祝卡氏旅途平安，卡陳兩氏一並在站上合攝一影留念。記者來長半年，今首次與此曾爲長春之戰時統治者之蘇軍將領談話，渠囑記者轉吿長春市民謂：渠在長期間，多蒙各方協助，甚爲感謝。記者係陪同甫於昨日來此之五美記者冒味前往車站，五美記者並不擬訪問此最後離去之蘇軍將領，渠等係爲參觀最後撤退之蘇軍而來。記者與叧外兩中國記者趨前與卡洛夫少將周旋時，五美記者則在站上散步，有人詢問卡氏是否願與美記者一談，卡氏稱吾。按美記者五人中，有三人曾于上次來長春與卡氏相談，而本日竟未交談一語。據卡氏行前吿陳家珍少將稱：長春市內現尙有蘇士兵三名，因事未及登車，此外已無其地蘇軍。</p>
<p>〔又電〕此間蘇軍雖已撤退，然蘇聯國旗仍飛揚於若干建築物上，此項雞築物門前，多訂有木牌，上書「此建築物及其一切爲蘇聯人所有」，記者曾見有若干最堅實最漂亮之新式住宅，現正有人從事改造，彼等均謂係自日人手中購得者。叧有若干樓房，內住新近搬來之蘇籍僑民，其中多自稱爲中長路職員，然有人確認彼等之中有不少人曾穿着蘇軍軍服，彼等住居之處，並常見有形跡可疑之中國人出入。</p>
<p>〔又電〕曾受蘇軍統治八月短五天之長春八十萬市民，於蘇軍最後離去之日，並無任何明顯表示，渠等於目擊城防司令部上之蘇聯國旗飄飄撤下時，心中或有輕鬆之感。然此種感覺瞬息即爲遠處傳來之槍聲所攪亂，渠等對於目前之局勢，雖多以沉默之態度處之，然渠等昨曾醵金八十萬元流通券，慰勞保衛長春之保安隊，此舉當能適切代表渠等之語言。</p>
<h3>中共對津郵局　提出要求三點</h3>

<h3>軍調部重申前令　各軍應恢復一月十三日位置</h3>
<p>〔本報北平十四日電〕北平軍事調處執行部近爲澈底澄淸各地軍事糾紛，曾頒布和字第六號命令，申誡政府及中共軍隊，必須停駐於本年一月十三日下午十二時正所在之位置，任何部隊，曾越過上述位置者，應立即退出，各指揮官應嚴格執行此項命令，各執行小組則應予以監督指導，但此項任務，在執行時不得碍及交通綫之開放，或執行部其他命令之執行，任何指揮官如不遵令撤退至上述之位置，將以違反停戰命令論罪。此項命令係以國府蔣主席及執行部委員鄭介民·饒伯森·葉劍英四人發出，並有附件，規定爲恢復一月十三日午夜之位置起見，政府方面高級指揮官與中共方面高級指揮官，應在執行小組之下，召開會議，中心小組應負責佈置開會事宜，確定與會人員，排定會議日期，地點，及其他事項，儘速召開會議，該項會議之目的，爲提出關於一月十三日午夜各所在位置之報吿，並盡可能範圍之內，調整各指揮官彼此之衝突之申訴。最近太原。濟南。及石家莊小組，俱正爲召開此項會議而努力。</p>
<h3>政協小組討論憲草　三點已獲得同意　國大代表名額決定擴充</h3>
<p>〔本報重慶十四日電〕政協綜合小組昨續舉行，諸代表首起立爲王若飛秦邦憲二氏默哀三分鐘，旋就憲草中行政院與立法院關係一項，進行討論，各方同意三點：（一）立法院對行政院有咨詢之權，行政院對立法院有作施政報吿義務。（二）行政院對立法院所交決議，實行時倘發生困雖時，可請總統提交立法院覆決，如有三分之二以上之同意時，即仍維持原案。（三）行政院認爲有某項立法之必要時，可向總統提交立法院，如徵得三分之二以上同意，可予討論。惟因政府代表提議將政協原定憲草修改原則中，立法院與政院關係一項之第一條取消，即取消行政院立法院負責之主張，政院應向總統負責，總統向國民大會負責，中共民盟對此均不能同意，主張保留，故未獲完全協議。嗣決定由各方自派一人，共組將歷次討論時獲得協議之點整理後，寫成文字記錄。昨日出席會議，除中共改由陸定一代表，靑年黨改由陳啓天常燕生代表外，其餘仍照舊。</p>
<p>〔法新聞社重慶十三日電〕政治協商會綜合小組於本日午後開會，決定將憲法草案整個問題，提交憲法審議會討論。國民黨代表王世杰已將政府改組案，提交綜合小組，綜合小組及決定，將國民大會代表名額自二千零五十名增加至二千四百名，共產黨與民主同盟，仍當佔其四分之一，俾克行使否決權，照此計算，僅能予以六百席，但共產黨堅持要求六百五十席，因此未能商有成議。要而言之，雙方對於行政院與立法院之相互關係，曁國府委員會非國民黨籍之委員人數分配兩大問題，意見仍未一致。</p>

<h3>周恩來招待記者</h3>
<p>〔聯合社重慶十四日電〕中共在渝代表周恩來今日招待新聞記者稱：東北局勢已發展成「內戰」狀態，共軍在此狀態中，保留反擊之權，包國長春之共軍，有「充分政治權利」，可於蘇軍如期於今日退出長春時，進佔該市。馬歇爾將軍現在返渝途中，將發覺中國局勢絞彼匝月前赴華盛頓時所料者，大爲危急。或問馬歇爾特使能取何種步驟，解決中國局勢，周氏稱：希望馬歇爾將一本過去公正精神，採取任何必要步驟。除非軍政問題，均吿解決，否則中共不致參加國民大會。如果就東北停戰，修改憲草，人民自由及遵守政協決議各點，商獲協議，則中共并無拒絕出席國大之理由。今距國大開幕期尙有二十天，如果解決上述各項問題，不獲進展，則在此二十天內，完全妥協之可能性，極爲渺茫。</p>

<h3>伊朗政府訓令駐美大使　向安理會提保證　履行蘇伊協定　謂亞省蘇軍一部份已撤退　蘇對逾期不撤兵有所辯護</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦十四日廣播：伊朗總理今日復以新訓令電達出席安全理事會之伊朗代表阿勒，向安全理事出保證，謂：蘇伊協定，將充分予以實施，據極可靠之情報，亞塞爾拜然省之蘇駐軍隊巳有一部份撤退，一俟撤退完竣，伊朗即將與亞塞爾拜然當局舉行談判。</p>
<p>〔聯合社德黑蘭十四日電〕伊朗宣傳部長費羅士今日稱：伊政府已訓令駐美大使阿勒，向聯合國安全理事會聲明蘇伊協定訂明蘇軍於五月五日前悉數退出伊朗，伊政府相信協定條件，將被忠實履行，毫無疑義。或問是英訓令是否爲伊朗案將從安全理事會議程中撤除，費氏稱，此乃手續問題，須由理事會自行決定</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦十四日電〕在此紐的安全理事會將商討伊朗申訴案將否加以撤銷一事之前四十八小時，莫斯科電台正式廣播蘇聯文吿，辯護紅軍超過一九四二年條約之期限而繼續留在伊朗一事。該文告并未提及英軍於一九四一年同時與蘇軍開入伊朗之經過情形，略謂：紅軍乃根據一九二一年蘇伊友好條約之規定而開入伊朗，蓋該的規定紅軍有開入伊朗國境，直至最後稍滅危機面止之權利。所謂危機，即指倘有外國欲利用伊朗爲進犯蘇聯之根據地而言，德國即欲利用伊朗自南面進攻蘇聯，蘇軍開入伊朗，遂挫敗德國此項計劃，目前德國之威脅已予消滅。故蘇軍開始退出伊朗。路透社外交訪員加以評曰：反軸心國戰爭去年即勝利結束，蘇直至簽訂蘇伊石油協定后，始認爲德國威脅消滅。此殊令人不明如何加以解釋。</p>

<h3>解決屋荒問題</h3>
<p>上海這　個月來，一般人感覺頭痛的問題似乎不少，屋荒也是其中之一。房屋租賃的糾紛，聲浪始終不絕，而頂費之大動輙需付黃金數十兩乃至一二百兩，租金且有以美金英鎊計算者，真可謂駭人聽聞，惟其如比，一般市民更感到居住問題之嚴重壓迫，而從後方復員到滬的各機關與公務人員，雖需要住房很迫切，却又不能負擔此種額外非法的需索，去和富商大賈競爭，於是問題愈形複雜。政府不能不負起責任，多少把這問題解決一部分，這是情勢所不得已。最近行政院爲上海敵僑即將遣送完畢，他們所遺留的住屋逐漸騰空，就乘這個時機，特別規定分配上海各機關房屋辦法七項，並且準備組織委員會，統　房屋的分配，其動機自然也是要想爲此屋荒問題，在無辦法中檀且　出一個辦法來。</p>
<p>本來，建國之首要在民生。人民有食衣住行的四大需要，政府即有設法滿足人民需要的責任。住旣爲其旣之一，故建國大綱就規定政府須建築屋舍以樂民居。收復區內的都市，兵燹之後，房屋損毀過多，各地都鬧屋荒，聽說南京更比上海爲甚。上海人口三百五十萬，未必減於戰前，但南市閘北江灣吳淞以及近郊一帶，頽垣敗璧，觸目皆是，八年之間旣未有所修建，勝利以後，政府和人民都紛紛忙於應付眼前，大家已感覺到透不過氣來，更沒有人想到如何可以促進新屋的添建，除了間或聽到所謂平民住宅的呼聲外，縱使臨時房屋也從未有人提及籌建的話，大家只知就原有的房屋上打主意。這是上海屋荒的主因，也是一切收復區內各都市屋荒的主因。所以，探本窮源，解決屋荒的根本辦法應該從儘速籌建新屋着手，怎樣集資，怎樣取材，怎樣鳩工，這都是在「籌建」的範團以內，恕不能逐一詳舉，而鼓勵籌建的前提，就首先在保障業主的所有權和取締非法漁利的「頂費」。</p>
<p>今天，我們如不能一步就根本解決此屋荒問題，則不得已而思其次，祗有針對迫切的現實，先謀局部的解決。我們以爲目前上海急待解決的房屋問題，不外下列三點：（一）各機關和公務人員覓屋困難問題；（二）原有業主權益的保障問題；（三）非法「頂費」「小租」等的取締問題。根據這三點，對於行政院所定的辦法試加檢討，我們以爲這辦法雖非盡善盡美，而在此時此地尙不失爲一種暫時補救的辦法，不過僅靠此辦法的確還不能完全全解決屋荒問題而已。</p>
<p>第一，各機關和公務人員覓屋困難，此爲盡人皆知之事實。就機關論，上海市內公產原屬不多，目前除原屬兩租界工部局公董局之屋舍仍可繼續使用外，其餘都需租賃。而最困難者，一般復員到滬的公務人員，無論政府機關或事業機關的職員，他們流離八載，一旦回來，或屋舍已毁，或租賃被奪，轉輾尋覓，棲遲無所，要他們一方面僅恃有限的待遇，一方面在真費小租的重壓下去解決住的問題，政府那有理由說得出？政府縱不能爲全市市民解決此住的問題，天公地道說句話，也該在此時至少爲這些復員歸來的窮公務員解決此住的問題。行政院辦法第三第四兩項規定，敵僑居住房屋，非敵僞所有者，爲應復員緊急需要，交中央信託局統一承租，儘先分租與復員來滬之機關及公務人員，以一年爲期，租戶須簽訂合同，祖保按月繳付規定租金，如果確能照此辦理，則九萬餘名敵僑所遺留的房屋七九六〇幢，除敵僞房屋二〇九九幢應由政府出售外，其餘五千八百餘幢，可以儘先分租於必需房屋的機關與公務人員，以免他們再和一般市民去競租其他的房屋而加重屋荒的程度，更免得他們租不到住房而徒喚奈何。</p>
<p>第二，或者以爲這樣辦，豈非侵害了原有業主的權益？其實，所謂「權益」，我們分析一下，不外居住權和出租權而已；因爲我們此時絕對不容許任何業主在今天旣不自住又不出租！果爾，則此五六千幢的房屋，除了極少數證明眞由業主自住者或當酌定公允辦法外，其餘地產公司之所有者，無非出租而已。那末，同樣出租，何以不能租與政府？今天政府爲了應復員緊急需要計，統一承租，並且訂約繳租，祗以一年爲期，期滿遷讓，不得展期，並不得轉讓，違者勒令遷出（原辦法第三項），而且未經核准擅自居住前項房屋者，均限期遷出（原辦法第五項），其對於原業主的出租權，在情理上已予以充分之保障，談不到有什麼侵害。若說是業主或已事前出租於房客，今這樣一辦，未免有破壞民間契的之嫌。那末我們應問：原業主如當年租與敵僑者，其契的是否於敵僑回國以後仍應繼續有效？如當年爲敵僑强占或故意媚敵而讓其住用者，現在於國家戰勝，政府遣回敵僑以後，由政府指定機關，與業主訂約承租，究竟破壞了什麽契約？至於若說有些房屋，已由業主最近與新房客訂有契約，不容漢視，則試間在敵僑尙在開始遣送，房屋尙未由政府發還業主以前，業主是否即已有權叧行擅自出租，而絲毫不顧政府當前之需要？換言之，國家打勝仗，政府封房屋，是否即爲此少數業主造成收回房屋大括金條（頂費）之惟一機會？平心而論，我們以爲政府統一承租，只要確能訂的在一定限期，照付合理租金，又在一定限期內担保遷讓，業主就無藉口權益，捍然拒絕之理。</p>
<p>（三）目前上海屋荒潮中最不可解的，無過於頂費小組之驚人，而政府以往似乎熟視無覩。今天無房可住的人固屬可憫，而建有房屋的眞正業主，其利益反不若狂索頂費之二房東與濫討小租之經租帳房。今天上海房地產幾無買賣市面可言，而只見頂來頂去之交易，頂費金條之價格，幾與置產所需不相上下。業主租與房客，幾經歲月，不知更換了若干姓名，而業主依然無權顧問。業主向其租戶所收的租金或僅抵戰前之幾十倍乃至一二百倍，而租戶轉頂與他人，或向三房客所勒索者，常十百倍蓰於其所繳之租金。房客租賃期滿，業主無權收回叧租，却只有眼睜睜看着房客因出頃而有鉅額的收入；甚至有業主眞須自住却反要向房客付頂費等於取贖房屋的笑話。在此種情形下，自然沒有人再願意投資造屋出租，招惹麻煩。於是屋荒勢必永久嚴重。行政院此次所訂辦法，是否美善，他姑不論，但以訂的一年，期滿遷讓，不得展期不得轉讓一點而言，如能認眞實行，確可爲打破頂費小租惡例開一新紀元。爲一般業主着想，與其只怪政府的統一承租，還不如加强要求政府嚴格履行辦法第三項。因爲只要房屋出租，能够依的如期收回，只要政府以後確能照此方針處理一般房屋租賃糾紛，不但業主的權益得到了確切的保障，並且掃除中問剝削者頂費小租的不法利得，對於一般正常租屋的房客也有莫大的利益。</p>
<p>話又說回來，「徒法不能以自行」。我們不能僅僅靠了行政院這一紙辦法就可解決上海的屋荒問題，還得有執行辦法的「人」。人不公正，一切良法美意都會變質！何况這辦法自然也不是根本解次屋荒盡善盡美的辦法？不過我們也得爲政府想想，爲一般窮公務員想想，更得爲一般業主被不法之徒强佔房屋，一無收入，而始終呼籲無門者想想，在此時此地，解決局部的屋荒，也只有先試行這個辦法。</p>

<h3>實施糧食配給制　應考慮問題尙多　關係方面表示：觀察目前國內情况未敢冒險嘗試</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕記者頃以外人方面迭有建議，本市急須實施糧食配給，及有效管制等方案，詢諸關係方面。據稱：糧食配給一案，政府早有考慮。惟硏究結果，認爲利弊參半。以中國兩前之情况觀，實未敢遽而冒險嘗試。揆厥困難原因：（一）中國各都市人口，從無精密統計；即有之，則量多不確，質更不論。（二）一配給制之施行，必須分地全面配給，免致人口羣集配給區，造成配給區人口膨脹之患。此外尙須考慮分物配給，蓋旣配糧食，其他待配之物品亦所在皆是，又何獨糧食而然。（三）政府勢須握有足敷數月耗用之配給糧，且尙須維持大批米糧源源不斷之供應，無形中將原有糧商，全部消滅。（四）配給糧價難定，過高旣非人民所欲，過低則又將造成羣集配給區爭購之現象。（五）因統籌配給之故，鄕村產地之糧價，經陸續大批收購後，必將較都市糧價反高。（六）無職業者寄生者，亦須配給。故考慮以上種種原因，認爲我國實施糧食配給制度，恐未能獲得預期之效果，而積弊反因而叢生云。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕本市英商法商電車公司，因數月來物價直綫上漲，工人巳照生活指數給薪，公司開支日見增高，而車票未漲，收入依舊，虧蝕甚鉅。日前呈請市公用局調整票價，聞已獲准，新票價將於十六日實行。電車之最高票價，將爲一百二十元及二百元。公共汽車最高票價爲三百元，較原價約增加二倍。至於公用局所辦之公共汽車是否將同時漲價，現尙未定。</p>
<h3>上海人談「住」色變　屋荒癓結可在？　投資於建造新房子很不上算　敵僞所遺空屋分配未盡合理</h3>
<p>〔本報特寫〕本市的屋荒問題，本不自今日始，不過於今爲烈罷了。最近市臨時參議會對房屋加租問題辯論的激烈，各方對日僑大批撤退後遺留空屋爭奪的白熱化，房屋租貨管理委員會調處房屋案件的有增無已，行政院分配上海各機關房屋緊急措置的頒佈，……都充分地暴露之屋荒問題的嚴重性。記者想探求這問題的解答，曾向各關係方面採訪了一下，得到以下的一篇零星資料。</p>
<p>添造新屋</p>
<p>百分之百的不利</p>
<p>解決屋荒問題的最根本辦法，莫過於大批添造新屋。可是以當前的情形看起來，對造屋的條件是百分之百的不利。目前造新屋最現實的阻礙，據一般的說法，是打不出利錢。造價太高，收穫太徵。現有房地產的人，想把租賃收入作爲營利事業的美夢，早成過去。相反的，他們只感到有了房地產，反增加了他們的累贅。有許多房屋，因爲租金的有限，而各種捐稅和管理費用支出的浩　，業主常有倒貼的情事發生。把它買了吧。直接稅則上偏又規定，在房地產出賣金額超過二百萬元以上的所得額，都要課百分之五十的財產出賣所得稅。業主對房地產的自然增値，免不了都有可望而不可即的苦衷。再說遺產稅率也相當大。所以有人喊出，現行的損稅率太高，也阻礙了新屋的誕生。</p>
<p>就建築材料的供應而談，據專家說，情况不算是頂嚴重。倒是八年抗戰使工作的技術人員大大减少。許多木匠泥水匠，八年中多沒收徒弟，改行的也不少，要蓋大批的新屋，人手上難免不感到缺乏。至於造屋的空地，熱鬧的市區，固然極少，郊外地區，則因市府要定新路綫的計劃，還不能發放造屋執照。即使有也是臨時性的建築。還有道契到地政局過戶換證時間的冗長，竟使道契的執有者，踟蹰不前，而在未領得正式的土地誰前，照規定是不許造屋的。</p>
<p>有過計劃</p>
<p>終於不能實現　　市府對造屋，也有過計劃。據說遠在去年十一月間，就已草擬了建築三千幢平民住宅的計劃。當初估計造價，的需法幣二十萬萬元。拿了這計劃先後向金融界洽談造屋資金，結果是因爲利息低，款斜大，時期長，而引不起金融界投資的興趣。可是一再因循，當初佔計的造價，到現在已漲到一百萬萬元，何處去覓取這龐大而需做利的資金呢？退一步而向「聯總」請領建築村料，又說要毀損在百分之五十以上的都市，才能享受配給建築材料的權利，這個希望，又無形消滅。中央信託局方面，當初也有計劃。擬將所接收的全國敵僞房地產，統盤標售，把所得資金，建築大批復興住宅。可是照目前的情形看起來，這計劃的命運，也早已束諸高閣了！</p>
<p>顧此失彼</p>
<p>是福音是惡耗</p>
<p>在新屋添建無望聲中，日僑撤退后所遺留下來的一部空屋，當然形成各方爭奪的矢的。於是人言嘖嘖，有抨擊佔屋人的不法者，有非難敵僞產業處理局處理的不當者，這種種終於在前天行政院規定分配上海各機關房屋的七項辦法後，獲得了一個暫時的解答。行政院顯然看到了處理敵僞居住房屋的複雜性，爲統籌解決起見，才規定最後的處理權，由行政院決定。這辦法對復員來滬的機關和公務人員，是一個福音。可是對有一部份已經合法取得業主租的，和戰赫原住戶的續租者，終不勉有滄海遺珠之憾。而虹口庫倫路一帶的租戶，已因勒令遷移，而羣起請願。想像中諸如此類的案件，前途必是方興未艾。於是呼籲聲聲，是希望行政院在這次的緊急措置外，能再有些補救的辦法。當然，辦法的初衷，聰是善良的。可是顧此失被，亦所難免，舉個例子，租賃法往往變了房客永遠佔據房屋的護身符，這豈是立法家的初衷嗎？</p>
<p>治本治標</p>
<p>總期公允合理</p>
<p>據估計本市在戰時房屋的毀損率，不過是百分之十五至二十。受損地區，是以南市閘北較量。而本市的人口，據市府最近的估計，也不過三百三十多萬，羅普斯金戰前并沒有增加。所以解決屋荒的治標方法，還是要在分配方面多多努力。合理分配敵偽居住房屋，不過是整個分配計劃的開端。有人建議，是否可仿照法國巴黎市府的辦法，調查空屋，或有多餘房間的房屋，踝以極重的空屋稅，直至屋主出租而後已。治本方面，還得要添造新屋，和向國外訂購大批活動房屋。在人民無意投資的局面下，政府應設法組織運銷合作社，統籌購運各種建築材料。籌集資金，不妨發募一種建設公債，指定各關係事業平均攤銷。這是火衆福利的事，有關的各方面都應攤出一份力量來，才能收衆擎淘修，水到渠成的效果！（蒼龍）</p>
<h3>王正延抵滬后談話　歎滬人享樂奢侈　希望當局多推行現代教育</h3>
<p>曾任我國駐美大使及戰後敵人罪行調査委員會主任委員王正廷氏，最近由渝轉港來滬，不久將搭船赴菲島一行。昨晨王氏在其私邸接見記者稱：此次赴菲島任務，究全私人行動，乃以設在馬城之交通銀行（馬城交通銀行係在菲政府註册幷非我交通銀行分行）董事長資格，參加該行行將舉行之股東大會。事畢，即須赴美，稍作勾留。王氏對記者所詢其本人將來對於政治興味如何時，稱：國家以人民爲本，本立而道生，本固邦裨，每一國民，都應對國家多負責任，多盡義務，更應從頭做起，由小至大。試觀歐炎各國之公共事業，均由人民自理，毫不依賴推諉於政府，先總理亦着重於地言自在治，可爲明證。關於我國踏入民主道路時期，王氏表示民主乃民衆的，以民衆爲依歸，當然特別擁護民意，更應密切注意人民生活，以發揚光大民生主義，使人民安居樂業，則種種悲觀暗影，可整個消弭。王氏末稱：上海一般人民，似覺亨樂奢侈，熱心投機，少數靑年，學非所用，見利思遷，造成人才恐慌現象，希望當局多推行現代敎育，加强訓練專門人材，從事建國，自力更生，使新中國能與世界先進民主國家駢肩邁進，共登民主之堂。</p>
<h3>市公共汽車　一度聯合停駛</h3>

<h3>濬浦局工作一斑　挖泥成織逐漸進步　托駁缺乏應響整個工作計劃</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕記者頃訪濬浦局局長施孔懷氏，承吿八載淪陷，本市浦江失濬，水道淤塞，大船航行困難。目下航業界最感困苦者，的可分三端：（一）碼頭灘岸因年久失溶水淺，巨輪難於起卸；（二）江岸一帶碼頭倉庫，堆積敵僞物資，外輪進口貨物，無處堆置；（三）較良之碼顯被美軍徵用，故碼頭感極度之缺乏。又云戰前濬浦局共有挖泥輪。拖駁輪。等共七十多艘。勝利後接收者僅三十艘，迄今已有五十餘艘，戰前有挖泥輪十六艘，現剩八艘，且內中僅五艘可應用，三艘必需修理。拖駁輪戰前有十四艘，現僅五艘。泥駁輪戰前二十六艘，現二十四艘，內八艘不能應用。濬浦局自去年九月中旬接收後，即恢復浦江挖泥工作。戰前每月挖出之泥沙平均爲二十五萬噸，去年九月十七起至九月底，濬浦局挖泥的一萬噸。十月份爲二萬餘噸，十一月份三萬噸，十二月份四萬噸，一月份五萬噸，二月份六萬噸，三月份八萬噸。預料本月可增至十萬噸之目標。由以上數字，可見濬浦局已不斷在改進中。據施局長云，照現在之挖泥輪工作效率，每月當可挖泥十八萬噸，惟拖駁輪缺乏，故整個工作計劃，不能儘量發展也。</p>

<p>本市各廠業已次第恢復生產，物資供應漸見充沛，且外來物資亦絡續有到，戰時供求失調之情勢，已漸消失，投機者黃金時代已成過去，最近貨物售價，雖尙在高峰盤旋，殆終難持久，一旦國內外交通暢達，進出口物資圓滑，商業競爭開始，物價前途，必有重大變化，茲將上週商業金融槪况分誌如左。</p>
<p>烚赤　上週傳說紛紜，又造成投機者取巧，中行配售價仍爲一六〇萬元未變，金業申請者極少，黑市已低於官價，週初開一四七萬，週二更低至一三八萬元，惟逢低有買，行情得以維持不墜，週三四在一四二萬至一四六萬間盤旋，週五中行及證券帮頻有吸收，價由一四七萬升至一五六萬，週六走勢更俏，一度穿至一六三萬，收市爲一六○萬五、</p>
<p>外幣　美鈔因中行美匯二〇二〇元供給價始終不動，交易沉　，週一至週四盤旋於一千八百七八十之間，至週五因有外匯放長謠言，市况轉變，買風頓盛，　　九一〇升至一九七〇，週六一度穿出二千元關外，收價二〇四〇，超過中行美匯供給價，港票自新老貨軋平後，已無風浪可起，全週上落不過一二十元而已。</p>
<p>公債　統一公債全週以週二三趨勢最見鋒鋩，因受百念倍還本傳說刺激。週二在利買傳說中，內種曾在五千元關內外徘徊，收價四八五〇元，其餘均見上　，週三多空傾軋甚劇，市勢迂迥曲折，數度創五千一二百元之新高價，終以散戶趁高吐售，軋低百元，週四至週六空頭帮羣起·動，價漸下游，丙種最後價跌至四三二〇元，甲乙見二千一百元，丁種二千一百五，戊種二干三百五、</p>
<p>股票　週初華股在賣氣瀰漫中，均吿挫落，新光減色允多，外股同趨下游，次日上午華股仍形軟弱，午後因游資灌注，頽勢略減，外股套買踵接，轉形堅穩，惟會德豐獨吿落後，週三華股波折甚多，結果三熱門股微挺，餘平平，外股套賣絡繹，致下挫，週四華股初呈盤旋狀態，終因銀根似鬆，買風重起，一致上漲，外股人心激昻，買氣旺盛，英聯躍升尤多，週五因金價報漲，人心振奮，華股市勢頓榮，外股連袂上升，週末華股初俏後疲，結果各挫半成光景，外股繼續上升，怡和喊一萬三千五百元，業廣迫六千大關，亞洲亦漲起一成多。</p>
<p>現紗　在上週間，初因黃金與股票不振，滬埠現紗有底充斥，粤漢等主要客帮實際銷路淸淡，多頭心思不安，大批斬結·空頭乘勢壓迫，星期二廿支特雙馬低峯曾到九十五萬，棧單貨竟小至九十二萬，旋以兩日間暴落過鉅，黃金又起漲風，客帮現銷轉形起色，引起散戶空頭獲利抵補，價復迂緩回上，金週除特雙馬比前週六獨跌九萬外，其餘各紗扯跌五六萬不等。</p>

<p>花市　廠家實際採辦欠佳，同業互做交易尙不寂寞，惟市價則以外棉時有來源，而廠家觀望日多，以致難以振作，較前週六的跌二三千元。</p>

<h3>業中人語　紗布衰落原因　　生產增加實銷不起</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕最近紗布市塲，由熱烈而趨澹泊，業中人談論市面不振之原因，的略如下：（二）上年歲暮，因製軍裝，動辦辦布疋甚多，一般投機者預料紅盤必漲，紛紛搜購，此時接收量未旺，現貨單薄，一時不敷應市，紗布市價，直綫上升，一般紗布商無不獲利甚厚，興高彩烈。（二）不料價格旣高，需要退縮，各路市面形成倒懸之局，靑島濟南烟臺方面坯布市價反較上海爲廉，申貨非但不能前往，該地之貨且運滬，至於漢口四川等處，市價亦不佳，於是販運者裹足不前，惟廣州商業較繁，紗布運往尙可獲利，無如船隻缺乏，假使大批貨物抵粤，市面亦受影響。（三）外匯市塲自開闢以來，趨勢安定，美棉進口踴躍，售價頗廉，廠方有此充足原料，努力恢復生產，日夜工作，以致物資增加，國營民營之紗布同時盡量開傅，久遠萎枯之市塲，已有充盈籌碼，囤積儲藏者咸具戒心，紗布市態乃緩步向下。（四）本年春初，中國紡織建設公司每逢開售紗布日期，布商紗號爭先恐後，擁擠不堪，棉紗登記有四百餘家，棉布登記有一千四百家之多，現在則逈非昔比，近日商品市價因受流言刺激，尙見昻騰，而紗布則平靜如故，蓋現銷不起，以後市面之榮辱，應從供求方面着想，不能專以投機爲目的也。茲將三月來之紗布高低價列下：</p>
<h3>雨衣原料　三度變遷</h3>
<p>戰後　貸崛起</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕雨衣之製着，始於民國元年之際，往後次第擴展，客帮需辦者，以靑島及漢口二帮爲最早，斯時材料，均係英製之雙面開水味及單面開水味，雙面紗與單面紗，普通條子和絲光條子幾種，顏色祗有藏靑，靑灰，黃灰等幾色，民國十年時，因都市人口增多，需要日盛，到銷因一此大旺，舶來品之新花色，有薄貨象皮裏者，如藍，紅，紫，綠，元，藏，灰，黃，靑，格子及點子等，五光十色，婦女雨衣更爲風行，普通條絲光條均相　淘汰，此時專門營做雨衣材料店家，計有匯康？怡康，昌記，恒元，榮昌德等，民國二十年左右·又見二次變遷，本客帮走銷與日俱增，西洋貨運到者有抱別林，東洋貨到申傾銷者，有紗面及薄貨冲麂皮漆皮等，面從前之貨，除單面開水咪盛行不衰外，又絡續淘汰，民國二十八年，逢第三次之變遷，因中外戰事發生，舶來品運到絕跡，本埠存貨相繼售罄，所有各種雨衣材料，大都均吿斷檔，而其民衆需要仍殷，於是國人互相硏究，發明象膠紗質雨衣布，而以原料及環境關係，不久又停頓，目今廣銷之防雨布，此時遂應運而出，中西裝雨衣，莫不趨之若鶩，風行全滬及京杭各地，査防雨布織製廠家馳名者，爲友生，大鳴，大昌，大公，雙鹿等，雨衣廠商經銷着名者，有榮昌德飛龍牌，祥生雙馬牌，上海之象牌等，永新愛地凱初亦譽滿春江，今因大昌不供給布料，遂見减色，此外尙有美綸光明等紡綢玻璃雨衣，化女喜其質輕價廉而美觀，銷路亦廣。</p>

<h3>東九省各大學　次第接收改組</h3>
<p>〔大華社瀋陽訊〕東九省各大學，業已次第接收。東北大學已遷回瀋陽，除原有之文學院及理學院外，幷將僞滿時期之奉天工業大學，併爲工學院，私立奉天商學院，改爲法商學院。新設之長春大學，除自設文學院及理學院外，幷合併僞滿時代之新京法政大學爲新法商學院，新京工業大學爲工學院，新京畜產獸醫大學爲農學院，新京醫科大學爲醫學院。濱江大學，除自設之文學院及理學院外，亦合併僞滿時代之哈爾濱學院爲商學院，哈爾演農業大學爲農學院，哈爾濱工業大學爲工學院，哈爾濱醫科大學爲醫學院。其他尙有僞滿時代之師道大學及師這學院，將合併改組爲國立東北師範學院，新京師道大學將改組爲國立東北女子師範學院，興安醫學院改組爲國立興安醫學院。至於佳木斯醫學院，北安開拓醫學院，廠井開拓醫院，因均爲日人設立，現已停辦。俄人所設之北滿學院，現分工商二部。敎會所設立之盛京醫科大學，頗負盛名，准其設立爲私立學院。另有敵僞設立之大陸科學院，規模宏大，設備完美，刻已由中央硏究院及東北敎育輔導委員會接收云。</p>
<h3>私校二次收費</h3>
<p>中小學聯會發表談話</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市私立中小學聯合會負責人蔣紀周氏，爲私校第二次收費事，特向本報記者發表談話如次：</p>
<p>收費標準</p>
<p>本市私立中小學核，本學期收費數額，係於本的一月間，參照市校教師待遇，以小學敎師月薪萬六千元，中學敎師月薪四萬四千元爲標準所規定。其時生活指數爲二十六年度之五百二十倍，至各校開學收費時，生活指數已高至一千八百餘倍，今則已逾二千倍，在　活極度成脅之下，全市八千餘　校敎師，急待救濟。其主要對策，如擴充敎育經費預算，及確定私校補助費等，固爲敎師所一致期望，臨時參議會亦已有同樣之決議。但此案本學期中恐難見諸實施。至尊師獻金，用意極善，惟私校需款過鉅，杯水車薪，於事無濟。</p>
<p>續徵原則</p>
<p>故經一再討論，並於教育局長召集之談話會中，曾有如下之決定：（一）各校得續徵學費一次，其數額以不超過上次各校所收學雜費爲原則，但小學至多一萬二千元，初中至多一萬六千元，高中至多二萬元，（二）淸寒學生應减免其學費，各校免費學額，不得少於百分之二十，（三）所收學費，除各校必需之開支外，以全部充作教薪爲原則。査本市各私校敎師，在任何困苦之下，未曾一日荒廢課業，此種崇高之敎育精神，各家長當均已體念，而樂予資助云。</p>

<h3>青白六比零克猶太　東華四比零勝義僑　分獲市長盃足球決賽權　逸園東義之戰幾成不歡</h3>
<p>昨市長盃足球複賽，上午在膠園，下午在逸園，均以開氣陰冷觀衆未如理想中擁擠，上午靑猶一役，頗見寥落，兩塲結果，靑白以六對〇大勝猶太，猶太福恩奧列維拉俱未臨陣，實力削弱不少，東華則以四對〇克義僑，自下半時十五分鐘時陳明哲撥入空門後，義僑認爲韓龍海早以手吻球，但裁判判決入網，義將氣憤之餘，遂實行怠工式足球，一任東華攻門，東華乃繼得二球焉。</p>
<p>敗走猶太</p>
<p>青白昨仍襲用戰東華一役之陣容，志在必勝，猶太非特拉將未遂，抑且福恩與奧列維拉相繼缺席，勢成必敗，開始後，混戰良久，狄亭左路切中，小顧首開紀錄，未幾秋亭再吊中，阿奎在廿五處一脚，又吿入網，上半時二對〇。下半時猶太雖岡收復，無奈實力不如，益以靑白後衛，無隙而入，十分鐘秋亭在左邊勾中，居然直接送入網內，費春華右路妙切，懶牛一頂，應聲聲入網，四對〇。此時盡是靑白天下，小費在最后十分鐘，竟爾運奪二城，靑白遂以六對〇勝猶太。</p>
<p>擊退義僑</p>
<p>東華昨以阿戴友仁不出塲，乃以龍海主中，幼良輔之，明哲右翼，友仁位置由老鐔權試，亦一理想中之變動。上塲東華即取攻勢，未見成功，義僑反攻，陷於拉鋸局面，上半時完程，雙方各無所獲。下半時戰鬥漸烈，精彩百出，十五分鐘時，李垚左邊傳中，龍海衝上與麥尼蒂相値，球門落空，明哲趕上一撥，送人網門，義僑認爲龍海用手打球，不能承認，唯裁判陳吉祥判有效，義將乃相率離塲，幸常局及瞿堯康解釋，再行入塲比賽，但義僑竟然演怠工方法，隨意應付，乃不旋踵間爲李垚先獲一球，韓龍海梅開二度，草草終塲，東華四對〇勝義僑，義僑隊員之此種精神，實不足爲法，深爲可惜。</p>

<h3>「廣州的春天比東京溫暖」　訪日本戰犯田中久一</h3>
<p>— 廣州五日航訊　本報特派員梁風寄</p>
<p>一輛略褪了色的藍色小轎車，載着記者穿過了熙攘的人羣！跨過了雄偉的海珠鐵橋，到達了河南，漸漸地離開了喧囂的城市，向着我們的目的地——大嗣戰犯拘留所急行。</p>
<p>正是暮春三月的清明時節，南國的氣候却宛如炎夏一般的悶熱。不過記者的心情仍是無限興奮的，因爲今天得到了熱心的行警政治部對敵廣播隊隊長黎　上校的協助，引領我們前去訪問那曾在華南叱咜風雲，號稱「南天王」，而現在被列爲戰犯於最近才被拘留的日本南支派遣軍總司令兼香港總督的日本陸軍中將田中久一。</p>
<p>車子在這多灰的小道上埃行了十分鐘，經過一次登記手續，才獲通過駛進裏面。</p>
<p>日戰犯拘留所</p>
<p>這戰犯拘留所在戰前原是太古貨倉和屈臣氏汽水廠，戰時被日人作爲日憲兵營房和汽車修理廠，可是現在，在一邊道旁堆滿了破爛的坦克車，小汽車和卡車等，另一邊是殘缺而彈痕纍纍的空廠房，一種荒凉的景象，使人意味到戰爭的殘酷和可怕。不過當你走進戰犯拘留所裏面的房屋，却又會有另一種感覺，因爲那裏正是珠江之濱；環境異常幽美，寬敞，空氣暢快清新。戰犯們優閒地坐樹蔭下；藏躲在房裏，看見記者們來到都擁出來看，裂開了嘴巴裝出怪樣子的笑容，經過他們身旁都立正敬禮，更有兩個熟悉黎隊長的跑過來親熱地和黎隊長握手言　。</p>
<p>日憲兵佔多數</p>
<p>「這裏拘留戰犯共有五百六十多人。」戰犯拘留所的所長袁熙圻少將對記者說：「這裏全是日人，其中日憲兵佔四百多人。日本的高級將領也不少，有三個是中將：一是田中久一，一是日軍第一三〇師團長近藤新八，一是本月二日才扣留的第一〇四師團長末　知交。另有三個少將：一是平野機一，一是下河邊憲二，這兩個都是旅團長，另一個是重藤憲文，是個憲兵司令官。」</p>
<p>帶來隨員五名</p>
<p>袁所長選綱續說：「現在他們是分三個地方住，將官們住在一塊，憲兵住在一塊，由各處解來的戰犯又住在一塊。他們的伙食：每天有米廿五兩，副食費一百元，在這範圍以內可以自由活動。戰犯進來時須將衣物登記，而且留下指紋，書籍經過檢查後可以閱讀的。田中久一是昨（四）日才解到這裏，行營張主任特許他帶來五個隨員：一侍從副官，一醫生，一看護，一勤務，和一個廚師」。</p>
<p>日本式小洋房</p>
<p>袁所長說完，即引記者到一幢日本式小洋房裏，那房子前後都是走廊，中間一連三室，第一間是田中久一獨居，室內陳設簡單，中央舖上幾張厚席，一張小儿塞在席的中間。左邊角落用布隔成一個更衣室。這時，田中正在前邊寬闊的走廊上，坐在一張大圓桌旁邊的騰椅上看樹，面對着綠水悠悠的江面，狀至悠閒。由黎隊長道達記者來意後，田中連忙謙虛地起立表示歡迎，我們便圍着大圓桌坐下來。</p>
<p>田中是一個短小精悍的人物，那瘦小的身軀，披上摘下了微章符號的日軍服。臉型瘦削，兩顴微　，眼角有點下垂，鼻樑上架着一副玳瑁眼鏡，咀上留有小鬍，倒是個典型的日本老軍人。任他怎樣故意裝成雍容鎮靜的態度，但却掩飾不了他那抑鬱深沉的情緒。他現年已五十八歲，日本九州人，畢業於士官及陸大，歷任日本各軍校教官和小隊長師團長，到華南已二年多。但他對人說：他並沒有參加過什麼戰役，僅在卅二年參加西江一役而已。在日本投降後，他便代表華南區日軍簽降，並任日俘連絡部部長。這次是由主使殺截被擊落美機師數人和殺害中國無辜百姓兩項犯罪理由視爲戰犯，而予以逮捕的。</p>
<p>侈談他的任務</p>
<p>袁所長對田中的生活略爲垂詢過後，田中不待記者發問，他便向黎隊長說要對記者談幾句話，黎隊長就義務的幫忙我們翻譯。</p>
<p>「我留在這裏的任務，是將十餘萬日俘遣送回國。現在既然本月十五日以前可以全部運送完畢，那末我的任務便算完成了」。他好像還沒有知道已被列爲戰犯似的，滔滔在說他的「任務」。</p>
<p>「這次日俘在集中營，厚蒙貴國萬分優待，他們都無限感謝。他們帶着一個極好的印象回去，必然會爲將來中日的友好努力，這是毫無疑問的。我正想用我的身份，準備寫一封信或者寫一篇文章，代表日本人民感謝貴國的寬大和優待。」</p>
<p>想讀三民主義</p>
<p>「現在我已如釋重担，心情如「出水明鏡」一般，異常清靜。我正懺悔着過去的一切，這可不必多說了。假如我這殘老的軀體能有機會回國，我必盡力爲將來中日友好而努力。現在我以戰犯身份，每天都在盼望中國能早日復員！」</p>
<p>他那一大套的巧言巧語和善頌善禱，已經是記者意料所及的談話了。記者問及他的生活和嗜好，他說他的心境甚佳，現在所住的地方有如別墅一般，甚感舒適。祇是他有胃病，甚願在天氣睛朗的時候多運動和種植。而他惟一的嗜好就是讀書。喜愛文學，他更想讀讀三民主義，他說祇可惜他的中文不大精，認爲最大憾事。他又向袁所長請求多給一點宗教方面的書籍給他看。他這番話，顯然是想表示他是個和平的人物，更以爲現在的懺悔，就可抹煞了他過去的罪行。至於他說想讀三民主義，這更未免是越來越說得巧妙吧。</p>
<p>承認過去錯誤</p>
<p>當記者問及他兩年來在中國戰塲上的感想，他衹說：「雖然貴國經這長時間的作戰，是很苦的，但相信作戰的時候，東京和大阪等地更苦哩！不過，所謂「不打不相識」，過去祇憑聽說而却没有了解中國，但現在裴却透澈了解中國了。我們承認過去的一切錯誤，我現在對貴國很同情的。自從九一八以後，你們受的是抗日教育，而日本人所受的侵略教育，而現在都成爲過去了。我祇希望中日兩國友誼重新建立，更希望中國能把日本拉起來，因爲日本的文化完全是源自中國的哩！」</p>
<p>家破人亡之痛</p>
<p>他說了這一篇似是而非的理論之後，記者再問他的家庭境况。</p>
<p>「我有兩個兒子：大的已經戰死。現祇有一個十三歲的幼子了。去年二月，曾接過他們來信，但後來我在東京的家，已被盟機炸毀，現在他們怎樣，已無從知道了。」他像有無限感慨地說。</p>
<p>這裏環境那麼幽靜，當你每天看到悠悠的江水，船隻的往來，你會有什麼感想嗎？」記者好奇地問</p>
<p>「柳綠花不紅」</p>
<p>「當我每天看到紅日西沉，斜陽反照在珠江水面，是非常愉快的。所以每天當潮水高漲的時候，有時也難免有些感觸而想寫幾首詩，不過尚未開始着手寫。」他掛上了一絲苦笑，一會再說：「我是崇拜老子學說的，所謂「柳綠花不紅」，我的心境和命運，正如「流水行雲」，祇有聽其自然而已。」</p>
<p>那時他低下頭去，兩眼凝視着擺在他面前的一本新關良三著的「日本演劇論」，一會又抬起頭來，望着遙遠的江面，似乎在沉思最後，記者問及當他在接到日本投降消息之後的感想，他說：「這真是一言難盡，當時復雜的思想是非言可喻。稍停了一會，他微微嘆了一口氣說道：「不過停戰以後，我們的官兵逃跑的甚少，而且還能嚴守紀律。他們現在都回去了。可是，他們回去能否看到他們的家人，他們有沒有飯吃，恐怕還難說哩！」</p>
<p>看「華南之虎」</p>
<p>黎隊長再引記者到第二室，那裏住着是前面說過的兩個中將，那時他二人正下着圍棋。黎隊長說：日本陸軍中有所謂一龍二虎，所謂「龍」者是在華北，一虎是「馬來亞之虎」山下舉文，其餘一虎就是這個正在下棋的「華南之虎」近　新八，他們就是以善戰著名的。</p>
<p>再過第三室，那裏就是三個日軍少將的住處，那個長着兩筆「仁丹　鬍子的下河邊憲二，正在那裏從事繪畫消遣，當他發現記者過去時，他便哈哈大笑道：「你看我這兩筆大鬍子像個典型的日本軍閥嗎？」其實他大概也是强顏歡笑罷了。</p>
<p>大約十分鐘後，我們的車子不覺又重跨上那雄偉的海珠鐵橋上，我們都俯瞰橋下的江水，輕輕的拂着橋腳。黎隊長頓即憶起了昨天的事，他說他昨天押解田中久一到戰犯拘留所的時候，也是在這橋上，田中有感而發說：「廣州的春天比東京還溫暖哩！」</p>
<p>（四，五，於廣州）</p>

<p>生產建設　特輯</p>
<h3>中國技術人才往何處？</h3>
<p>— 楊謀</p>
<p>面對着這一個戰火所留賜給我們的廢墟，每一個人，都會發生嚴重的責任感。無論，在抗戰的烽火中，我們已經擔受了多少的磨難和苦楚，但是，現在所到來的，決不是享福和安適，而應該用加倍的耐力去忍受克服一切的困難，要在廢墟上去重新建立　我們的國家來。</p>
<p>我們的國家，現在，正像是這體鱗傷，而渴望着全國民的奮起。歷史所賦予每一個中華子孫的責任是重的，而歷史所賦予每一個中華子孫的發展才能的機會也是優美無比的</p>
<p>試窮開一下報紙：</p>
<p>議路交通缺乏枕木，鐵軌，車頭，航運沒有輪船，空運沒有飛機，更普遍缺乏的是燃料，工廠，像一個個饑餓的野獸，正應努力加工邁進的時候，却頹然倒穩定，工潮的迭起，失業人數的激增，物資的缺乏，特價的飛漲，……。</p>
<p>多少艱苦的命運，降落在我們國家的頭上。</p>
<p>報載，當局爲修補津浦路南段起見，決將京蕪無路移拆，此訊一傳，南京糧價即直綫上漲。這種剜肉補瘡的消息，該令心弦震得多麽沉重？而全國公路會議席上，更普遍指出的是材料的缺乏，經費的無着。勝利已經六個月，但是　詳細觀察一切不上軌道的局面，真令欲哭無淚。一戰爭的恐怖的巨掌已經給我一們驅走，但是，戰後經濟恐慌的巨掌又已伸了進來。</p>
<p>這是一個難苦無比的局面！這是一個艱苦無比的局面！克服這一個難局，我們才能到達光明。無法云克服它，我們也就永遠沉淪在黑暗的深淵裏面。固然，我們也可以利用外力，但是，記住啊，「外力」所希望我們的，決不是單純的中國的富強，他們也有他們自己切身的打算，我們愈利用外力，我們本身所肩負的也愈是加重。</p>
<p>中國的技術人才呢？他們往何處去？</p>
<p>固然，我們不能抹煞，許多的技術人才艱苦自持，在后方替抗戰立下了不滅的功勳·但是，很多很多的，在生活的驅逼下，在種種牽掣的環境下，他們對中國的建設，表示了灰心，而轉逐到投機的商界去了。這不是一個偶然的現象，這是一個普遍現象　。許許多多的，訓練好了的技術人才，犧牲了他們所學的，在向投機之途奔逐。固然，在我們這一個什麽都一貧乏的國家，做一個技挪人才，的確是件太不容易的工作。固然，國家所給予技術人才的待遇，太不够維持家庭的生活。固然，國家對于技術人才的任用升遷，一直沒有明確的方法，一樣的概得亂七八糟。固然，國家對于技術人才的職位，毫無保障。——即使一切的理由都是眞實，都是充分，但是這都不能作爲逃避做一個技術人才的理由。</p>
<p>因爲，因爲國家在呼召你，，國家在需要你！</p>
<p>技術人才自身的命運，本來就是艱苦的，他要從赤手空拳中創造出來，他要從荊棘遍地中生長起來。一切的艱難威脅不了他，他的歷史就完全是一部創造性的，奮鬥歷史。現在，國家在召喚，更有什麼理由去拒絕呢？</p>
<p>現在，我們國家所需要的，還只是一種「修橋補路」式的工作。我們只希望把破壞的路修了起來，停工了的工廠開起工來，但是，誰都不能否認，更艱苦，更偉大的工作儘多儘多呢？</p>
<p>中國的技衛人才們？你們向何處去？挺起胸來走上艱苦的途一徑？還是綢續逃避？</p>
<p>歷史所賦予的，正是千載難逢的機會，我們只有接受的權利，沒有拒絕的權利！並且，這不只是權利，也是義務，國家在碎破的廢墟中，要恢復它的强大的雄姿，難道我們身爲國民的，還應該拳拳較量于個人利益的得失麽？</p>
<p>在砲火中，我們度過了八年最惡劣的命運。現在，新的生命在滋長，聽，國家的呼召！中國的技術人才，我要重覆一遍，這是千載難逢的機會啊！</p>
<p>詹天佑，范旭東，替我們開拓了先驅的道路，試翻閱一下他們的歷史，就可以知道中國技術人才每一個人所担負的，是多麽的沉重？</p>
<h3>豐富的東北資產</h3>
<p>— 咸</p>
<p>東北面積約五十萬方哩，合全國七分之一。人口四千三百萬，合全國人口十分之一。但擁有的資產，竟等於其他各地之和。東北資產（戰前）和本部比較是這樣的：陳北本部工贓數目　三九〇〇　三八五〇鐵路長度　七五九〇哩　七三一九哩鋼鐵產量（每年）四五〇〇〇〇　噸五〇〇〇〇噸煤（每年）一五〇〇〇〇〇〇噸　二五〇〇〇〇〇〇噸</p>
<p>至於東北未開發的富源（石油，金，錳，鎢，鐵，煤等）估計約有一五〇〇〇〇〇〇噸。（美·紐約時報海外周刋）</p>
<h3>工商管理概論</h3>
<p>— 徐百益</p>
<p>五·商業循環</p>
<p>無論那一種事業，除了自身組織，必須力求健全外，對於環境方面，也要顧到，因爲無論那一種事業，決不能離開環境而生存。</p>
<p>事實上，事業與環境，有兩種方法，一種是適應環境，一種是創造環境，在進行的難易上，適應環境固然並不容易，但創造環境，更爲困難。</p>
<p>在應該顧到的環境方面，最重要的就是商業循環（Business　Cycle）了。這可以應用圖表來說明，每一家廠商，應該把每年的銷售總額，生產總額，和利潤總領，有準確的統計，然后分別畫成統計圖表，可以一目了然</p>
<p>在統計表中，可以看出向上或向下的趨勢，由好轉的趨勢，就是逐漸走上不景氣的路，由壞轉好，就是一個轉機。一個管理人員，如果用了國表，就可以看出商業的趨勢，在逐衰落的時期就要設法挽救，不要等到了最后一步，再想辦法就更費力了，在情形一天天進步的時候，要時時刻刻留心，可能地了生的轉變，要有一定地步驟前進。如果一味激進，那末就要發生尾大不掉的情形，職工是加多了，設備也加多了，但結果銷路呆滯，就要使資金周轉不靈，到了那時候，不得不把貸品廉價售出或忍痛地裁員或减薪，使事業不能順利地經營。</p>
<p>美國在一九二〇年曾經遭遇着空前的不景氣，那不景氣的造成原因，有下列幾種：</p>
<p>一。當時的銀行，放款過多，突然收縮，於是工商業就不能利用銀行的透支，於是就不能向前發展而祗能保守，有一部份工商業爲了要清償銀行的借款起見，不得不把貸品廉價出售，因爲廉價出售，就不得不减少利潤，甚而至於　本。</p>
<p>二·　運輸機構因爲戰事而暫時失常，因此使貨品不能暢快地一達到各處去，生產之后，就有過剩的現象。</p>
<p>三·生活程度的高漲，使一般的進款，跟不上一般物價，祇能停止購買，零售商的營業淸淡以後，生產者的貨品，就下能順一利地銷行了。</p>
<p>四·市面一般人的囤積，希望獲得善價，因此原料和製成品，都囤積起來，一旦不景氣開始，就紛紛拋出，這種現象，對於一般工商業是不利的。</p>
<p>當上述的情形有一種存在的時候，就應該設法去謀補救，以挽救工商業的前途，決不要等到臨時設法，就要感覺到事實上是太晚了。以中國的情形講，在戰事時期，有不少工商業大量囤貸，大事增資，到了勝利以後，就要遇到空前的困難了。</p>
<p>爲了把事業處理得順利起見，我們要訓練在事前看到商業情形的可能的轉變，我們可以把美國一九二〇年的不景氣時代來解釋，一個够了解商業循環的人，在一九一九年就可以預先看到未來的危機。因爲在一九一九年之前，許多工商業都在大量生產一，因爲需要流動資金，於是都向銀行透支，結果使銀行的放款額不得不有一個限制，於是就將數額减少，利息增高，一個有眼光的管理人員，就能够及早看到而趕快使他的生產與銷售平衡。</p>

<h3>Defense Commander Assumes Office Yesterday Morning, Changchun Announces Temporary Martial Law, Three Battles Underway in Suburbs</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 14th] Chen Jiazhen, the Defense Commander of Changchun, and Liu Demo, the Deputy Commander, officially took office at 10:00 AM on the 14th. Simultaneously, they issued a written announcement taking over the entire Changchun defense and immediately posted notices announcing a temporary martial law in the Changchun area, effective from 10:00 AM on the 14th. The following matters will be enforced during martial law: (1) Temporary suspension of gatherings and associations. (2) Inspection of news, mail, telegrams, and publications. (3) Prohibition of carrying or possessing weapons, except for regular military police and those specially permitted by the Defense Command. (4) Inspection of hotels, public places, and private residences deemed suspicious. (5) Street inspections to be carried out when necessary. (6) A complete curfew from 6:00 PM to 7:00 AM the next day, except for regular military police and those holding passes issued by the Defense Command. (7) The transport of large quantities of food and all military-related materials is prohibited without permission. In the afternoon at 3:00 PM, Major General Chen Jiazhen held his first reception for Chinese and foreign journalists. According to him, the communist army besieging Changchun numbers 30,000. He felt that the pressure from the communist army surrounding Changchun was very heavy, but he stated that he was determined to do his best to defend this city that had been taken over by the government. At 7:00 PM in the evening, Mr. Chen will give a broadcast speech to the citizens, announcing his determination to defend Changchun.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 14th] On this day of the final withdrawal of Soviet troops, battles broke out in three areas on the outskirts of Changchun. One of them was at Jiatun, seven kilometers southwest, which was attacked by the communist army at 4:30 AM this morning, and was repelled by the local garrison after four hours. Another location was Sangjiawopu, near the airfield. According to officials, there were approximately 2,500 to 3,000 communist soldiers there, launching an attack on the airfield in three directions. The battle situation was quite tense. The 13th Regiment of the 4th Security Brigade stationed in the suburbs dispatched a team to assist, and the communist army's offensive was slightly weakened. By 10:00 AM, both sides were in a stalemate. Another location was near Lvyuan, midway between the city and the airfield. The battle there is currently underway. In addition, the 6th Branch of the City Police Bureau near Weichengzi was occupied by the communist army this evening, which is very close to Changchun and poses the greatest threat to Changchun.</p>
<p>[Another dispatch] The battle near the airfield on the morning of the 14th, after a four-and-a-half-hour standoff, became fierce again at 3:30 PM in the afternoon. At 5:00 PM, the communist army had approached the edge of the airport, and several shells fell into the field. A plane flew from Shenyang to Harbin today. The plane was originally scheduled to land here in the morning and then fly to Harbin. When the plane flew here, because there was a battle near the airport, it flew directly to Harbin. At 3:00 PM in the afternoon, the plane returned from Harbin and landed at the airport during a temporary lull in the fighting. As soon as it landed, the battle started again, and the plane took off and returned to Shenyang. According to reports, our plane flew to Harbin, which was the first time in fourteen years.</p>
<h3>Occupying Changchun for 228 Days, Karlov Leads Troops Northward, Wartime Rule of Soviet Army Completely Eliminated</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 14th] Major General Karlov, the city defense commander of the Soviet army, led his headquarters personnel and the last batch of Soviet troops by train northward at 10:20 AM on the 14th. The wartime rule imposed on Changchun by the Soviet army was completely eliminated. From this day on, Changchun City truly gained liberation, and our army officially took over the city's defense. Municipal administration is no longer subject to external interference. According to reports, the Soviet army entered Changchun on August 19th last autumn, lasting for a total of 228 days. When Karlov led his troops to leave Changchun today, Major General Chen Jiazhen, a member of our country's military delegation and commander of the Changchun defense, went to the station to see them off. The two had originally agreed to meet and talk at 9:00 AM on the 14th, but it was temporarily canceled and changed to a meeting at the station. Three minutes before the train departed, Chinese and Soviet send-off personnel raised their glasses together on the train to wish Karlov a safe journey. Karlov and Chen also took a photo together at the station as a souvenir. The reporter has been in Changchun for half a year and is now talking to the Soviet general who was once the wartime ruler of Changchun for the first time. He instructed the reporter to tell the citizens of Changchun that he was very grateful for the assistance he received from all parties during his stay. The reporter accompanied five American reporters who had just arrived here yesterday and ventured to the station. The American reporters did not intend to interview the last Soviet general who left. They came to see the final withdrawal of the Soviet army. While the reporter and two other Chinese reporters stepped forward to deal with Major General Karlov, the five American reporters strolled on the station. Someone asked Karlov if he would like to talk to the American reporters. Karlov said no. According to reports, three of the five American reporters had previously come to Changchun to talk with Karlov, but today they did not exchange a single word. Before leaving, Karlov told Major General Chen Jiazhen that there were still three Soviet soldiers in Changchun city who did not make it onto the train due to some matters, and there were no other Soviet troops in the city.</p>
<p>[Another dispatch] Although the Soviet army has withdrawn from here, the Soviet flag still flies over some buildings. In front of these buildings, there are many wooden signs with the words "This building and everything in it belongs to the Soviets". The reporter saw some of the most solid and beautiful new-style residences currently being renovated. They all said they were purchased from the Japanese. There are also some buildings where newly moved Soviet expatriates live, many of whom claim to be employees of the China Chang Railway. However, some people have confirmed that many of them have worn Soviet military uniforms, and suspicious-looking Chinese people are often seen entering and leaving their residences.</p>
<p>[Another dispatch] The 800,000 citizens of Changchun, who were ruled by the Soviet army for eight months less five days, did not show any obvious expressions on the day of the final departure of the Soviet army. They may have felt relieved when they saw the Soviet flag on the city defense headquarters being lowered. However, this feeling was instantly disturbed by the sound of gunfire from a distance. Although they mostly deal with the current situation with a silent attitude, they raised 800,000 circulation coupons yesterday to comfort the security team defending Changchun, which should appropriately represent their language.</p>

<h3>Political Consultative Conference Subcommittee Discusses Draft Constitution, Three Points Agreed Upon, National Assembly Delegate Quota Decided to Be Expanded</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Chongqing, 14th] The Political Consultative Conference Comprehensive Subcommittee continued to meet yesterday. The delegates first stood up and observed three minutes of silence for Wang Ruofei and Qin Bangxian. Then, they discussed the relationship between the Executive Yuan and the Legislative Yuan in the draft constitution. All parties agreed on three points: (1) The Legislative Yuan has the right to consult the Executive Yuan, and the Executive Yuan has the obligation to report on its administration to the Legislative Yuan. (2) If difficulties arise when the Executive Yuan implements a resolution submitted by the Legislative Yuan, it may request the President to submit it to the Legislative Yuan for reconsideration. If two-thirds or more agree, the original proposal will be maintained. (3) If the Executive Yuan believes that a certain legislation is necessary, it may submit it to the President to submit to the Legislative Yuan. If it obtains the consent of two-thirds or more, it can be discussed. However, because the government representative proposed to cancel the first article of the Legislative Yuan and the Executive Yuan's responsible relationship in the original draft constitution modification principles of the Political Consultative Conference, that is, to cancel the assertion that the Executive Yuan and the Legislative Yuan are responsible, the Executive Yuan should be responsible to the President, and the President should be responsible to the National Assembly. The Communist Party and the Democratic League could not agree to this and insisted on retaining it, so a complete agreement was not reached. Subsequently, it was decided that each party would send one person to jointly organize the points agreed upon in the previous discussions and write them into a written record. Yesterday's meeting was attended by Lu Dingyi representing the Communist Party, Chen Qitian and Chang Yansheng representing the Youth Party, and the rest remained the same.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Chongqing, 13th] The Comprehensive Subcommittee of the Political Consultative Conference met this afternoon and decided to submit the entire issue of the draft constitution to the Constitutional Review Committee for discussion. Wang Shijie, the representative of the Kuomintang, has submitted the government reorganization plan to the Comprehensive Subcommittee. The Comprehensive Subcommittee has decided to increase the number of National Assembly representatives from 2,050 to 2,400. The Communist Party and the Democratic League should still account for one-quarter of the total, so that they can exercise their veto power. According to this calculation, they can only be given 600 seats, but the Communist Party insists on asking for 650 seats, so no agreement has been reached. In short, the two sides still have different opinions on the two major issues of the mutual relationship between the Executive Yuan and the Legislative Yuan and the distribution of the number of non-Kuomintang members of the National Government Committee.</p>

<h3>Zhou Enlai Receives Reporters</h3>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 14th] Zhou Enlai, the Communist representative in Chongqing, received newspaper reporters today, stating: The situation in the Northeast has developed into a state of "civil war". In this state, the Communist army reserves the right to counterattack. The Communist army besieging Changchun has "full political rights" and may occupy the city when the Soviet army withdraws as scheduled today. General Marshall is now on his way back to Chongqing and will find that the situation in China is far more critical than he expected when he went to Washington a month ago. When asked what steps Special Envoy Marshall could take to resolve the situation in China, Zhou said: He hopes that General Marshall will take any necessary steps in the spirit of fairness in the past. Unless military and political issues are resolved, the Communist Party will not participate in the National Assembly. If an agreement is reached on a ceasefire in the Northeast, amending the draft constitution, people's freedom, and compliance with the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, then the Communist Party has no reason to refuse to attend the National Assembly. There are still 20 days before the opening of the National Assembly. If no progress is made in resolving the above issues, the possibility of a complete compromise within these 20 days is extremely slim.</p>

<h3>Iranian Government Instructs Ambassador to the U.S. to Offer Guarantees to the Security Council; Commits to Fulfilling Soviet Agreement; Says Part of Soviet Troops Have Withdrawn from Azerbaijan Province; Soviets Defend Delay in Troop Withdrawal</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] London, 14th Broadcast: The Iranian Prime Minister today sent a new instruction by telegram to the Iranian representative to the Security Council, Ahle, guaranteeing to the Security Council that the Soviet-Iranian agreement will be fully implemented. According to highly reliable information, part of the Soviet troops stationed in Azerbaijan Province have already withdrawn. As soon as the withdrawal is complete, Iran will hold negotiations with the authorities in Azerbaijan.</p>
<p>[United Press, Tehran, 14th] Iranian Minister of Propaganda Firooz said today that the Iranian government has instructed its ambassador to the United States, Ahle, to declare to the United Nations Security Council that the Soviet-Iranian agreement stipulates that all Soviet troops will withdraw from Iran by May 5. The Iranian government believes that the conditions of the agreement will be faithfully fulfilled, without any doubt. When asked whether the British instruction would lead to the removal of the Iranian case from the Security Council's agenda, Firooz said that this was a procedural matter that must be decided by the Security Council itself.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 14th] Forty-eight hours before the Security Council in New York discusses whether to withdraw the Iranian complaint, Moscow Radio officially broadcast a Soviet document defending the Red Army's continued stay in Iran beyond the deadline stipulated in the 1942 treaty. The document did not mention the British troops' entry into Iran simultaneously with the Soviet troops in 1941. It stated that the Red Army entered Iran according to the provisions of the 1921 Soviet-Iranian friendship treaty, which stipulates that the Red Army has the right to enter Iranian territory until the crisis is completely eliminated. The so-called crisis refers to the situation where a foreign country attempts to use Iran as a base for attacking the Soviet Union. Germany attempted to use Iran to attack the Soviet Union from the south. The entry of Soviet troops into Iran thwarted this German plan. Now that the threat from Germany has been eliminated, the Soviet troops have begun to withdraw from Iran. A Reuters diplomatic correspondent commented that the anti-Axis war ended victoriously last year, and the Soviets only recognized that the German threat was eliminated after the Soviet-Iranian oil agreement was signed. This is difficult to explain.</p>
<p>[U.S. News Service, Washington, 13th] The State Department announced today that the U.S. Ambassador to Iran, Murray, will return to the United States within the month due to illness.</p>
<h3>Franco Suggests the United Nations Send a Fact-Finding Mission to Spain</h3>

It is understood that the Spanish government does not intend to formally submit this suggestion to the Security Council because Spain is not a member of the United Nations organization, unless a third party proposes it, which would be another matter.</p>
<p>[United Press, New York, 13th] Representatives from Poland and Mexico today expressed their readiness to oppose the proposal of the Franco government. However, it is not yet known whether they can obtain sufficient support in the Security Council to defeat Franco's suggestion. Some representatives said privately that Franco's suggestion is subject to conditions and may be difficult to accept.</p>

<h3>Double Happiness for Japanese Communist Leader; Marries Brother's Widow, Wants to Go on Honeymoon</h3>

<h3>Washington Anxious About Future of Four-Power Foreign Ministers Meeting; Believes Paris Peace Conference May Never Be Held</h3>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 13th] It was announced here today that the French government has instructed its ambassadors to London, Washington, and Moscow to invite the foreign ministers of those countries to attend the Four-Power Foreign Ministers Meeting in Paris on April 25.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 12th Dispatch] While Washington officials remain silent on the future relationship between the U.S., Britain, the Soviet Union, and France in finally resolving the European issue, they hold a pessimistic view of the Four-Power Foreign Ministers Meeting to be held on April 25, which may not only postpone the long-awaited Paris Peace Conference on May 1, but may also never be held. If this is the case, the wartime allies may sign peace treaties separately with the enemy countries. One theory is that the outcome of the meeting to be held in Paris on April 25 may be a split between the Soviet Union and the three Western democracies. The Baltimore Sun quoted an official as saying: According to information from the U.S., Britain, and France, the three countries may abandon further cooperation with the Soviet Union to complete the treaties with Germany and its vassals, and separately sign treaties with Italy, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Romania. It is learned that the United States plans to discuss the internationalization of the Ruhr and Rhineland regions with France after the April 25 meeting. If the four powers cannot reach a consensus, U.S. officials believe there are three possibilities: (1) Hold a peace conference to resolve the disputes; (2) Each country separately sign peace treaties with the former enemy countries; (3) The U.S., Britain, France, and other countries that can reach an agreement jointly sign peace treaties.</p>
<h3>Strange Social Phenomenon in Java; 200,000 Women Eager to Find Mates</h3>
<p>[United Press, Los Angeles, 14th] Dutch novelist Fabricius recently told the public about the strange social phenomenon he saw in Java, saying that there are currently 200,000 women in Java who are eager to find male partners. Most of these women are Dutch or of mixed Dutch descent. After the outbreak of the Pacific War, they were isolated from men and imprisoned in concentration camps. For three and a half years, they did not see a Caucasian man, resulting in these women falling into a state of extreme depression. Once released, they went everywhere looking for nightclubs and refused to leave, talking about love all day long. Currently, the troops of the Netherlands, Australia, Britain, and the United States are helping these women solve their problems.</p>
<h3>Armenian Republic, One of the Soviet Union; Demands Turkey Return Territory; Georgian Republic Also Has Territorial Demands on Turkey</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Moscow, 14th] Officials of the Armenian Soviet Republic and Armenian patriotic organizations abroad are openly demanding that territory currently within Turkish borders be returned to Armenia, and their voices are growing louder. The Georgian Soviet Republic also has territorial demands on Turkey, but its public sentiment is not as high as that of Armenia. Armenia is currently publicly demanding from Turkey the return of six provinces: Kars, Ardahan, Artvin, Van, Erzurum, and Erzinjan. The first three provinces were proposed last year, and the latter three were proposed at the beginning of this year. The reason is that the above-mentioned areas were forcibly ceded, and now they need to be recovered for security reasons. Armenia is a mountainous region and one of the smallest republics in the Soviet Union, with an area of approximately 30,000 square kilometers and a population of approximately 1.3 million. Its industry, agriculture, and culture have made considerable progress in the past 25 years. Georgia's demands on Turkey have so far only been mentioned twice in Moscow newspapers. The territory it demands is Ardahan, Artvin, Volto, Tatom, Bebute, Ispira, Gambusang, Kirosen, Trabzon, and Lazistan. Regarding Ardahan, Armenian patriots have also listed it among the demands, but their Soviet spokesmen have not included it.</p>

<h3>Solving the Housing Crisis</h3>
<p>Over the past month in Shanghai, many people seem to be feeling headaches from various problems, and the housing crisis is one of them. Disputes over housing rentals have been constant, and the key money (premium for renting) has been as high as dozens or even one or two hundred taels of gold. Some rents are even calculated in U.S. dollars or British pounds, which is truly shocking. Because of this, ordinary citizens feel even more severe pressure from the housing problem. While agencies and civil servants returning to Shanghai from the rear desperately need housing, they cannot afford such excessive and illegal demands and compete with wealthy merchants and large businesses. As a result, the problem becomes increasingly complex. The government cannot shirk its responsibility and must solve at least part of this problem, which is inevitable given the circumstances. Recently, as the repatriation of enemy aliens from Shanghai by the Executive Yuan is about to be completed, the houses they left behind are gradually becoming vacant. Taking advantage of this opportunity, the Executive Yuan specifically stipulated seven measures for allocating houses to various agencies in Shanghai and is preparing to form a committee to manage the allocation of houses. The motivation is naturally to try to come up with a solution to the housing crisis where no solution seems possible.</p>
<p>Originally, the primary task in nation-building is the well-being of the people. People have four basic needs: food, clothing, housing, and transportation. The government has a responsibility to find ways to satisfy these needs. Housing is one of them, so the "Outline of National Reconstruction" stipulates that the government must build houses to provide comfortable living for the people. In the cities within the recovered areas, too many houses were damaged after the war, and all places are experiencing a housing shortage. It is said that Nanjing is even worse than Shanghai. Shanghai has a population of 3.5 million, which may not be less than before the war, but in Nanshi, Zhabei, Jiangwan, Wusong, and the surrounding suburbs, ruined walls and broken buildings are everywhere. Nothing has been rebuilt in the past eight years. After the victory, both the government and the people were busy dealing with the immediate situation. Everyone felt overwhelmed, and no one thought about how to promote the construction of new houses. Except for occasional calls for so-called "affordable housing," no one has even mentioned the construction of temporary housing. Everyone only knows how to focus on the existing housing. This is the main cause of the housing crisis in Shanghai, and it is also the main cause of the housing crisis in all cities in the recovered areas. Therefore, tracing back to the source, the fundamental solution to the housing crisis should start with the rapid construction of new houses. How to raise funds, how to obtain materials, and how to gather workers are all within the scope of "construction," which cannot be elaborated on one by one. The prerequisite for encouraging construction is, first of all, to protect the property rights of owners and crack down on the illegal profiteering of "key money" (premium for renting).</p>
<p>Today, if we cannot solve the housing crisis fundamentally in one step, we must consider the next best option and focus on the pressing reality, seeking a partial solution first. We believe that the housing problems in Shanghai that urgently need to be resolved are nothing more than the following three points: (1) the difficulty for agencies and civil servants in finding housing; (2) the protection of the rights and interests of existing owners; and (3) the crackdown on illegal "key money" and "small rents." Based on these three points, we will review the measures stipulated by the Executive Yuan. We believe that although these measures are not perfect, they are still a temporary remedy in this time and place. However, relying solely on these measures is indeed not enough to completely solve the housing crisis.</p>
<p>First, the difficulty for agencies and civil servants in finding housing is a well-known fact. As far as agencies are concerned, Shanghai has few public properties to begin with. Currently, except for the houses originally owned by the Public Works Department and the Municipal Council of the two concessions, which can continue to be used, the rest need to be rented. The most difficult situation is for the civil servants who have returned to Shanghai from the rear, whether they are employees of government agencies or business agencies. After eight years of displacement, once they return, their houses have either been destroyed or their leases have been seized. They search everywhere and have nowhere to live. How can the government possibly justify them having to solve the housing problem under the heavy pressure of key money and small rents, relying only on their limited salaries? Even if the government cannot solve the housing problem for all the citizens of the city, to be fair and reasonable, it should at least solve the housing problem for these poor civil servants who have returned at this time. The third and fourth provisions of the Executive Yuan's measures stipulate that the houses inhabited by enemy aliens, but not owned by enemies or collaborators, will be leased uniformly by the Central Trust Bureau to meet the urgent needs of repatriation and will be preferentially subleased to agencies and civil servants returning to Shanghai for a period of one year. Tenants must sign a contract and pay the stipulated rent monthly. If this can indeed be done, then of the 7,960 houses left behind by more than 90,000 enemy aliens, except for the 2,099 houses owned by enemies or collaborators, which should be sold by the government, the remaining 5,800-plus houses can be preferentially subleased to agencies and civil servants who need housing, to prevent them from competing with ordinary citizens for other housing and exacerbating the housing crisis, and to prevent them from not being able to rent housing and simply crying in vain.</p>
<p>Second, some may think that this approach infringes upon the rights and interests of the original owners. In fact, if we analyze the so-called "rights and interests," they are nothing more than the right to reside and the right to lease. Because we absolutely do not allow any owners to neither live in nor rent out their houses today! If so, then for these five to six thousand houses, except for the very few that can prove that the owners genuinely live in them themselves or a fair solution should be decided upon, the rest, which are owned by real estate companies, are nothing more than rentals. Then, if they are all rentals, why can't they be rented to the government? Today, the government is uniformly leasing them to meet the urgent needs of repatriation and is signing contracts to pay rent, only for a period of one year, with a guarantee to vacate upon expiration, without extension or transfer, and those who violate this will be ordered to move out (original measure third). Moreover, those who reside in the aforementioned houses without approval will be given a deadline to move out (original measure fifth). In terms of reason and principle, the rental rights of the original owners have been fully guaranteed, and there is no question of infringement. If it is said that the owners have already leased to tenants in advance, then this approach may have the suspicion of breaking private contracts. Then we should ask: if the original owners rented to enemy aliens in the past, should the contract continue to be valid after the enemy aliens return to their country? If they were forcibly occupied by enemy aliens or deliberately allowed them to live in them to curry favor with the enemy, now that the country has won the war and the government has repatriated the enemy aliens, if the government designates agencies to sign leases with the owners, what contracts are being broken? As for if it is said that some houses have recently been leased to new tenants by the owners and cannot be disregarded, then may we ask: before the enemy aliens were being repatriated and the houses had not yet been returned to the owners by the government, did the owners have the right to independently rent them out without regard to the current needs of the government? In other words, does the country winning the war and the government sealing up the houses create the only opportunity for these few owners to collect large amounts of gold bars (key money) for recovering their houses? Impartially speaking, we believe that if the government uniformly leases the houses, as long as it can be sure to set a fixed term, pay reasonable rent, and guarantee to vacate within a certain period of time, there is no reason for the owners to refuse to hand them over under the pretext of rights and interests.</p>
<p>(3) Currently, the most incomprehensible thing in the Shanghai housing crisis is the alarming amount of key money and small rents, which the government seems to have ignored in the past. Today, those who have no houses to live in are indeed pitiful, but the benefits of the real owners who have built houses are not as good as those of the second landlords who wildly demand key money and the rent collectors who wantonly demand small rents. Today, there is almost no market for buying and selling real estate in Shanghai; only the trading of key money, and the price of gold bars for key money is almost the same as the cost of buying property. Owners rent to tenants, and over the years, they don't know how many names have changed, but the owners still have no right to ask. The rent collected by the owners from their tenants may only be dozens or even one or two hundred times more than before the war, but what the tenants transfer to others or extort from third tenants is often ten or one hundred times more than the rent they pay. When the lease term of the tenant expires, the owner has no right to take back the house and re-rent it, but can only watch helplessly as the tenant has a huge income due to the key money; there is even a joke that the owner really needs to live in the house himself but has to pay the tenant key money, which is equivalent to redeeming the house. Under this situation, naturally no one is willing to invest in building houses for rent, inviting trouble. Thus, the housing crisis will inevitably be permanently serious. Whether the measures stipulated by the Executive Yuan this time are good or not, we will not discuss them for the time being, but in terms of stipulating a one-year term, with a guarantee to vacate upon expiration, without extension or transfer, if it can be earnestly implemented, it can indeed open a new era for breaking the bad practices of key money and small rents. Thinking for the general owners, instead of just blaming the government's uniform leasing, it is better to strengthen the demand that the government strictly implement the third provision of the measures. Because as long as the houses can be recovered as scheduled after being rented out, and as long as the government can continue to handle general housing rental disputes according to this policy in the future, not only will the rights and interests of the owners be effectively protected, but also the illegal gains of the middleman exploiters of key money and small rents will be eliminated, which will also be of great benefit to the general tenants who rent houses normally.</p>
<p>However, "laws cannot enforce themselves." We cannot solve the housing crisis in Shanghai solely by relying on this single set of measures from the Executive Yuan; we also need "people" to implement the measures. If people are not just, all good laws and good intentions will deteriorate! Moreover, this method is naturally not a fundamental solution to the housing crisis. However, we must also think for the government, think for the general poor civil servants, and think for the general owners whose houses have been forcibly occupied by unscrupulous people, who have no income and who have been constantly appealing without success. In this time and place, to solve the local housing crisis, we can only try this method first.</p>
<h3>Correspondences from Various Locations</h3>
<p>Suzhou</p>
<p>The Chief of the Tax Office Imprisoned for Embezzling Tax Revenue</p>
<p>Tao Jieyu, the 28-year-old chief of the Hengjing District Collection Branch of the Wuxian Autonomous Tax Bureau, embezzled 177,168.68 yuan in tax revenue during his tenure and illegally printed 171 license certificates. After being discovered by the general office, he was reported to the county government. The county arrested Tao and sent him to the Procuratorate of the District Court. After investigation and prosecution, the District Court sentenced him to three years and six months of imprisonment, deprived him of his civil rights for three years, and recovered the tax revenue.</p>
<p>Changshu</p>
<p>The Provisional Consultative Council Exposes Fake Secret Agents</p>
<p>At the second meeting of the County Provisional Consultative Council on the morning of the 10th, councilors stated that Deng Yongnian, a fake secret agent, and Leng Yimin (alias Shen Bairu), a translator for the enemy's constitutional police, had infiltrated the Changshu Disciplinary Team of the Beijing-Shanghai Garrison Command's Pacification Supervision Group, where they indiscriminately arrested people and subjected them to torture and beatings. The councilors demanded that the team be withdrawn. According to the report of County Magistrate An Weinan, Deng Yongnian had been arrested by the county government after being accused by the people, but was subsequently taken away by the team. It was found that there were as many as five enemy constitutional police translators and fake secret agents mixed in the team. After discussion, it was resolved to telegraph the Garrison Command to severely punish them.</p>
<p>Wuxi</p>
<p>A Tragedy of a Hand Grenade Explosion</p>
<p>On the 11th, in Yanghua Village near Xueyanqiao Town on the border of Xiwu, the "Great Master" temple was consecrated. In addition to holding a incense festival, a local opera troupe was hired to perform in the village. The theater was crowded with people, no less than two or three thousand. During a tense moment, a hand grenade suddenly flew into the theater, causing a loud explosion and a complete chaos throughout the theater. Five people, including Yang Arong, were killed on the spot, and 29 people were injured. They were successively sent to Wuxi to be treated in hospitals such as the Brothers and Puren Hospitals.</p>
<p>Jiaxing</p>
<p>Preventing Black Market Distribution of Silkworm Eggs</p>
<p>A large number of silkworm eggs, totaling more than 30,000 sheets, have been transported to Jiaxing. The township offices have submitted lists of households to order them. The two rearing households in Wangdian and Zhenru have the most, so they are also allocated the most. In order to take care of the rearing households before the Anti-Japanese War, those who hold the debt receipts for selling autumn silkworm cocoons from the 26th year of the former Silkworm Silk Control Association can order them first. In order to prevent people from manipulating prices in the market (the original price was 2,000 yuan per sheet) and selling on the black market, the local China Silkworm Silk Company has formulated a method for receiving silkworm eggs to prevent malpractices.</p>
<p>Hangzhou</p>
<p>Traitor Xu Pucheng Arrested and Escorted to Hangzhou</p>
<p>The notorious traitor Xu Pucheng, who roamed the areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, held important positions such as commander of the puppet army. After the victory, he hid in Shanghai. Xu dared to secretly go to Jiaxing to take care of his properties in the Jiahu area, and was discovered by detectives and quickly arrested, then escorted to Hangzhou for interrogation.</p>
<p>Published Based on Incoming Letters</p>
<p>To the Editor-in-Chief of Shen Bao,</p>
<p>Respectfully, I am writing to inform you that the news published in the Shanghai and Wuxi newspapers on March 21 about the railway police in Wuxi brutally beating news vendors is not consistent with the facts. Our office is responsible for the management of railway police affairs and the maintenance of order at stations and on trains. On March 20, the railway police stationed at Wuxi Station cracked down on unlicensed vendors entering the station, which was carried out in accordance with railway regulations and was the duty of the railway police. However, the news vendor failed to understand and did not abide by the regulations. The station's patrol officer was also inadequate in his response, and the garrison's military police mistakenly overstepped their authority by transferring Song Yousheng, a police officer in active service in our office, to the judicial authorities, resulting in a dispute. After mutual clarification of the truth, the matter has been resolved. The so-called "bayonet injuries" are purely fictitious. In order to avoid confusion and misrepresentation, we are writing to request that your newspaper publish this letter to clarify the facts.</p>
<p>Respectfully,</p>
<p>The Police Department of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway Administration.</p>

<h3>Implementation of the Food Rationing System: Many Issues Still Need to be Considered; Related Parties Express: We Dare Not Take Risks by Experimenting with the Current Domestic Situation</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] This reporter recently inquired about the suggestion from foreign parties that the city urgently needs to implement a food rationing and effective control program, from the related parties. It is said that the government has long considered a food rationing case. However, after research, it is believed that there are both advantages and disadvantages. Considering the situation in China two years ago, we dare not risk attempting it. The reasons for the difficulties are: (1) There has never been a precise population count of Chinese cities; even if there is one, the quantity is mostly inaccurate, not to mention the quality. (2) The implementation of a rationing system must be carried out on a ground-wide basis, to avoid people from crowding into the rationing area, causing the population of the rationing area to expand. In addition, consideration must be given to rationing goods, because since food is rationed, there are other items to be rationed everywhere, so why only food? (3) The government must hold enough rationed grain for several months of consumption and must maintain a continuous supply of large quantities of rice, which will invisibly eliminate all existing grain merchants. (4) It is difficult to determine the price of rationed grain. If it is too high, the people will not want it, and if it is too low, it will cause a phenomenon of crowding into the rationing area to compete for purchases. (5) Due to the overall rationing, the price of grain in the rural producing areas, after continuous large-scale purchases, will be higher than the price of grain in the cities. (6) The unemployed and parasites must also be rationed. Therefore, considering the above reasons, it is believed that the implementation of the food rationing system in our country may not achieve the expected results, and accumulated abuses will arise as a result.</p>
<h3>The Last Scene of Joy and Sorrow in the Hongkou Japanese Concentration Area; Can Foreign Couples Avoid Separation? Listen to the Instructions of the Enemy Prisoner Management Office; The Fate Will be Decided Within the Day</h3>
<p>The Hongkou Japanese concentration area is facing the last scene of joy and sorrow. Chinese men who married Japanese women during the war, and Chinese women who married Japanese men, have been racking their brains for many days, trying to keep their families from breaking up and trying to delay the days of being repatriated as much as possible, prolonging the soon-to-be-broken dream. However, the repatriation of Japanese has reached its final stage and cannot be delayed any longer. Therefore, at night, when people are quiet, these foreign couples do not know how many tears of parting have been shed. In view of this, the Enemy Prisoner Management Office has specially notified those who have been married to bring their marriage certificates to the office from today to the 17th to receive instructions. How these people's fate will be, can be decided.</p>

<p>Shen Jinding, a consultant to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and former minister to Central America, was assigned as a consultant to the Chinese delegation of the Allied Joint Control Commission for Japan. He flew to Shanghai from Chongqing the day before yesterday and will transfer to Tokyo to take office. Yesterday, he told reporters that, in his personal opinion, China has been ravaged by Japanese militarism for the longest and most severe period, and Chinese people have a deeper understanding of Japan than other countries. Therefore, regarding the issue of controlling Japan, the Allies should pay attention to our opinions. The Chinese delegation flew to Tokyo from Shanghai at the beginning of the month. Advisor Shen was originally scheduled to leave Shanghai yesterday, but due to the bad weather, the flight was rescheduled to today.</p>
<h3>The "Sea Leopard" Leaves Shanghai for America</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The latest (C4) type ship "Sea Leopard" of the American President Lines arrived in port at the beginning of this month. Due to the delay in unloading, it was only completed last Saturday. It is scheduled to leave Shanghai for the United States this morning. The "President Grant" was originally scheduled to return to Shanghai from Little Luzon in the South Pacific via Hong Kong tomorrow and sail directly from Shanghai to New York on the 17th. The Shanghai office received a telegram from the Little Luzon branch last Saturday stating that the ship had suspended its voyage to Shanghai and would return directly to the United States from Luzon. It is reported that the ship had allocated tonnage to various exporters in the city, and a large number of goods were to be shipped to the United States. Now the company has transferred the reserved goods to the "Liwu Jie Ketuo", which will arrive in Shanghai within days and is scheduled to sail directly from Shanghai to New York on the 22nd.

The inaugural meeting was held at the Jingu Hotel on Xizang Road at 2 pm yesterday. The Social Affairs Bureau sent Feng, a specialist, to attend and supervise. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce also sent people to attend. More than 200 member representatives arrived. The meeting was chaired by Yao, but the meeting ended due to a dispute over the qualifications of the member representatives, and the charter could not be passed. It is said that the representatives who attended the meeting yesterday were based on the number of employees in each member's business, with each company sending one to seven people to attend. However, some members temporarily proposed that representatives should be sent according to capital units and pointed out that there was no draft charter or list of member representatives at the meeting, which was considered inconvenient for discussion. The chairman was unable to resolve the situation and had to announce the adjournment of the meeting.</p>

<h3>A Chauffeur Robbed of Money; His Car Was Also Driven Away</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Li Gennan, a 33-year-old Ningbo native who lives at No. 341 Wuding Road, has a black-plated car with the number 20003, which he uses to solicit business on various roads. At about 10 pm the night before, Li picked up a passenger on Beijing Road and drove them to the Carlton Apartment on Baker Road. When they arrived at the door, two people jumped on the car and ordered him to drive to the vicinity of Xiaonanmen in Nanshi. When they arrived there, two more people got into the car one after another. One of the robbers showed a hand-made gun, handcuffed Li's hands, and told him not to make a sound. They robbed him of more than 60,000 yuan in legal tender and a watch from his pocket. One of the robbers drove the car away. When they arrived at the intersection of Dinghai Road in Yangshupu, they drove Gennan out of the car and drove away. Afterwards, Li reported the information to the police station and asked them to pursue the robbers.</p>
<h3>Traffickers of Morphine Are Apprehended</h3>
<p>The Xujiahui Police Station arrested Pan Yu, a morphine trafficker from Meilong, at Tianping Road the day before yesterday and confessed that he bought it from No. 18, Lane 549 in Huanjing.

<h3>Tram and Bus Fares to Increase Tomorrow</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The British and French tram companies in this city have been experiencing a continuous rise in the price of goods over the past few months. Workers have been paid according to the cost-of-living index, and the companies' expenses have increased daily. However, tram fares have not increased, and revenue has remained the same, resulting in significant losses. They recently submitted a request to the Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities to adjust fares, which we hear has been approved. The new fares will take effect on the 16th. The highest tram fare will be 120 yuan and 200 yuan. The highest bus fare will be 300 yuan, approximately double the original price. It is currently undecided whether the public buses operated by the Bureau of Public Utilities will also increase fares simultaneously.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Residents Turn Pale at the Mention of "Housing" - Can the Housing Crisis Be Resolved? - Investing in Building New Houses is Not Worthwhile - The Distribution of Vacant Houses Left by the Enemy and Puppets is Not Entirely Reasonable</h3>
<p>[Special Report from Our Newspaper] The housing crisis in this city did not begin today, but it is now more severe than ever. The recent intense debate in the Municipal Provisional Council regarding the issue of rent increases, the heated competition for vacant houses left behind after the large-scale withdrawal of Japanese residents, the ever-increasing number of housing cases handled by the Housing Rental Management Committee, the promulgation of emergency measures by the Executive Yuan to allocate housing for various agencies in Shanghai... all fully expose the severity of the housing crisis. The reporter wanted to explore a solution to this problem and interviewed various parties involved, obtaining the following fragmented information.</p>
<p>Building New Houses</p>
<p>One Hundred Percent Unfavorable</p>
<p>The most fundamental solution to the housing crisis is to build a large number of new houses. However, given the current situation, the conditions for building houses are one hundred percent unfavorable. The most immediate obstacle to building new houses, according to general opinion, is that it is not profitable. Construction costs are too high, and the returns are too low. The dream of those who own real estate, to use rental income as a profitable business, has long passed. On the contrary, they only feel that owning real estate has increased their burden. For many houses, due to the limited rent and the high expenses of various taxes and management fees, landlords often find themselves losing money. Selling them? Direct tax regulations stipulate that 50% of the income from the sale of real estate exceeding two million yuan must be taxed as property sale income. Landlords inevitably have a feeling of being able to see, but not reach, the natural appreciation of real estate. Furthermore, the inheritance tax rate is also quite high. Therefore, some people are shouting that the current damage tax rate is too high, which also hinders the birth of new houses.</p>
<p>Regarding the supply of building materials, according to experts, the situation is not extremely serious. However, the eight years of the war of resistance greatly reduced the number of skilled workers. Many carpenters and masons did not take apprentices during those eight years, and many changed careers. It is inevitable that there will be a shortage of manpower to build a large number of new houses. As for the vacant land for building houses, it is of course extremely scarce in the bustling city center, and in the suburban areas, building permits cannot be issued due to the municipal government's plan to determine new road routes. Even if there are permits, they are for temporary buildings. Moreover, the lengthy process of transferring deeds and exchanging certificates at the Land Administration Bureau has caused deed holders to hesitate, and according to regulations, they are not allowed to build houses before obtaining formal land ownership.</p>
<p>There Were Plans</p>
<p>But They Ultimately Could Not Be Realized</p>
<p>The municipal government also had plans to build houses. It is said that as far back as November of last year, it had already drafted a plan to build three thousand affordable housing units. The initial estimated cost was 200 billion yuan in legal tender. This plan was presented to the financial sector to discuss funding for building houses, but the result was that the low interest rates, large amounts, and long periods did not arouse the interest of the financial sector in investing. Because of repeated delays, the originally estimated cost has now risen to 1 trillion yuan. Where can this huge amount of funding be found? Taking a step back and requesting building materials from the "United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration" (UNRRA), they said that only cities with more than 50% destruction can enjoy the right to be allocated building materials. This hope was also invisibly extinguished. The Central Trust Bureau also had plans to sell all the enemy and puppet real estate it had taken over, and use the proceeds to build a large number of reconstruction houses. However, based on the current situation, the fate of this plan has long been shelved!</p>
<p>Robbing Peter to Pay Paul</p>
<p>A Blessing or a Curse?</p>
<p>In the midst of hopelessness regarding the addition of new houses, the vacant houses left behind after the withdrawal of Japanese residents have naturally become the target of competition from all sides. As a result, there are many complaints: some criticizing the illegality of those who occupy houses, others criticizing the improper handling by the Enemy and Puppet Property Administration Bureau. Finally, a temporary answer was obtained with the seven measures for allocating housing for various agencies in Shanghai, which were stipulated by the Executive Yuan the day before yesterday. The Executive Yuan clearly saw the complexity of dealing with enemy and puppet residential houses and stipulated that the final handling power should be determined by the Executive Yuan to solve the problem in a coordinated manner. This measure is a blessing for agencies and civil servants returning to Shanghai. However, it is inevitable that some who have already legally obtained leases from landlords, and those who are continuing to rent as original residents, will feel regret at being overlooked. The tenants in the Hongkou Kulun Road area have already launched a petition because they have been ordered to move. It can be imagined that similar cases will inevitably continue to emerge. Therefore, there are calls hoping that the Executive Yuan can have some remedial measures in addition to this emergency measure. Of course, the original intention of the measure is good. However, it is inevitable to rob Peter to pay Paul. For example, the rental law often becomes a talisman for tenants to occupy houses forever. Is this the original intention of the legislators?</p>
<p>Addressing the Root Cause and the Symptoms</p>
<p>Overall, Fairness and Reasonableness are Expected</p>
<p>It is estimated that the destruction rate of houses in this city during the war was only 15% to 20%. The most affected areas were the Nanshi and Zhabei districts. According to the latest estimates from the municipal government, the population of this city is only over 3.3 million, which has not increased compared to the pre-war period. Therefore, the symptomatic solution to the housing crisis is to make more efforts in the allocation of resources. A reasonable allocation of enemy and puppet residential houses is only the beginning of the entire allocation plan. Some people suggest whether it is possible to follow the example of the Paris municipal government in France, investigate vacant houses, or houses with extra rooms, and impose extremely heavy vacant house taxes until the owners rent them out. In terms of addressing the root cause, it is also necessary to add new houses and order a large number of mobile homes from abroad. In a situation where people are unwilling to invest, the government should find ways to organize marketing cooperatives to coordinate the purchase and transportation of various building materials. To raise funds, it may be possible to issue a construction bond and designate the relevant businesses to share the amortization equally. This is a matter of public welfare, and all relevant parties should contribute their share of strength to achieve the effect of everyone working together to overcome difficulties, and success will come naturally!

<h3>Wang Zhengting Talks After Arriving in Shanghai - Lamenting the Extravagance and Luxury of Shanghai Residents - Hoping that the Authorities Will Promote Modern Education</h3>
<p>Wang Zhengting, who served as China's ambassador to the United States and the chairman of the Post-War Enemy Crimes Investigation Committee, recently traveled from Chongqing to Hong Kong and then to Shanghai. He will soon be traveling by ship to the Philippines. Yesterday morning, Mr. Wang received reporters at his private residence and stated that his trip to the Philippines was entirely a private action, in his capacity as the chairman of the Board of Directors of the Bank of Communications in Manila (the Bank of Communications in Manila is registered with the Philippine government and is not a branch of our Bank of Communications), to attend the shareholders' meeting of the bank. After the meeting, he must go to the United States for a short stay. When reporters asked Mr. Wang about his future interest in politics, he said: "The country is based on the people. When the foundation is established, the path will be born. When the foundation is solid, the country will be prosperous. Every citizen should bear more responsibility and fulfill more obligations to the country. We should start from scratch, from small to large. Looking at the public works in European countries, they are all managed by the people themselves, without relying on or shirking responsibility to the government. Sun Yat-sen also emphasized local self-governance, which is a clear example." Regarding the timing of China's entry into the path of democracy, Mr. Wang said that democracy belongs to the people and is based on the people. Of course, it is particularly important to support public opinion and pay close attention to people's lives in order to promote and develop the Principle of People's Livelihood, so that people can live and work in peace, and all kinds of pessimistic shadows can be completely eliminated. Mr. Wang concluded by saying: "The general people of Shanghai seem to enjoy luxury and are enthusiastic about speculation. A small number of young people are not using what they have learned and are easily tempted by profit, creating a talent panic phenomenon. I hope the authorities will promote modern education and strengthen the training of specialized talents to engage in nation-building and self-reliance, so that the new China can advance shoulder to shoulder with the advanced democratic countries of the world and ascend to the hall of democracy together."</p>

<h3>A Glimpse of the Work of the Dredging Bureau - Mud Dredging Gradually Improves - Lack of Tugs Affects the Entire Work Plan</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The reporter recently visited Mr. Shi Konghuai, Director of the Dredging Bureau, who informed us that due to eight years of occupation, the Huangpu River in this city had not been dredged, and the waterway was silted up, making it difficult for large ships to navigate. The shipping industry is currently suffering from three main problems: (1) The wharf beaches are shallow due to years of neglect, making it difficult for large ships to load and unload; (2) Wharf warehouses along the riverbank are piled up with enemy and puppet materials, and there is nowhere to store imported goods; (3) Better wharves have been requisitioned by the US military, so there is an extreme shortage of wharves. He also stated that before the war, the Dredging Bureau had more than 70 vessels, including dredgers and tugboats. Only 30 vessels were received after the victory, and now there are more than 50 vessels. Before the war, there were 16 dredgers, but now there are only eight, and only five of them are usable, and three need to be repaired. Before the war, there were 14 tugboats, but now there are only five. Before the war, there were 26 mud barges, but now there are 24, and eight of them are unusable. Since receiving the property in mid-September last year, the Dredging Bureau has resumed dredging work on the Huangpu River. Before the war, an average of 250,000 tons of mud and sand were dredged each month. From September 17 to the end of September last year, the Dredging Bureau dredged 10,000 tons of mud. In October, it was over 20,000 tons, in November 30,000 tons, in December 40,000 tons, in January 50,000 tons, in February 60,000 tons, and in March 80,000 tons. It is expected that the target will increase to 100,000 tons this month. From the above figures, it can be seen that the Dredging Bureau is constantly improving. According to Director Shi, based on the current efficiency of the dredgers, 180,000 tons of mud can be dredged each month. However, the lack of tugboats prevents the entire work plan from being fully developed.</p>

<p>Commercial News</p>
<h3>Commodity Prices Show Signs of Weakness Last Week - Securities Speculation Remains Hot</h3>
<p>The factories in this city have gradually resumed production, the supply of materials is gradually becoming plentiful, and foreign materials are also arriving continuously. The situation of supply and demand imbalance during the war has gradually disappeared. The golden age for speculators has passed. Although the prices of goods have been hovering at their peak recently, it will be difficult to sustain in the long run. Once domestic and foreign transportation is smooth and import and export materials are smooth, and commercial competition begins, the future of commodity prices will have major changes. The following is a summary of the commercial and financial situation last week:</p>
<p>Gold: Rumors have been circulating last week, which have created opportunities for speculators to take advantage of. The Central Bank's allocation price remains unchanged at 1.6 million yuan. Very few people have applied to the gold industry. The black market has been lower than the official price. At the beginning of the week, it opened at 1.47 million, and on Tuesday it was even lower at 1.38 million. However, there were buyers at low prices, and the market was able to maintain its position. On Wednesday and Thursday, it hovered between 1.42 million and 1.46 million. On Friday, the Central Bank and securities firms frequently absorbed gold, and the price rose from 1.47 million to 1.56 million. The trend was even more favorable on Saturday, once breaking through 1.63 million, and closing at 1.605 million.</p>
<p>Foreign Currency: Because the Central Bank's exchange rate of 2020 yuan for the US dollar has remained unchanged, transactions have been slow. From Monday to Thursday, it hovered between 1878 and 1880. On Friday, due to rumors of a relaxation of foreign exchange, the market situation changed, and the buying trend suddenly became strong. The price rose from 1910 to 1970. On Saturday, it once broke through the 2,000 yuan mark, closing at 2,040, exceeding the Central Bank's supply price for the US dollar. Since the Hong Kong dollar has been leveled between new and old goods, there is no more waves to be made. The rise and fall throughout the week was only about 10 or 20 yuan.</p>
<p>Government Bonds: The trend of the unified government bonds was most promising on Tuesday and Wednesday of the entire week, due to the stimulation of rumors of principal repayment. On Tuesday, amid rumors of interest buying, the price once hovered inside and outside the 5,000 yuan mark, closing at 4,850 yuan. The rest all saw an increase. On Wednesday, the competition between buyers and sellers was very fierce, and the market trend was tortuous, creating a new high price of 5,120 yuan several times. However, retail investors took advantage of the high price to sell, pushing the price down by 100 yuan. From Thursday to Saturday, short sellers rose up, and the price gradually moved downstream. The final price of Type C fell to 4,320 yuan, Type A and B saw 2,100 yuan, Type D saw 2,150, and Type E saw 2,350.</p>
<p>Stocks: At the beginning of the week, Hong Kong stocks all fell amid a pervasive selling atmosphere. New Guang's depreciation was significant, and foreign stocks also trended downstream. The next morning, Hong Kong stocks were still weak, but in the afternoon, due to the influx of hot money, the downward trend was slightly reduced. Foreign stocks were bought one after another and turned firm. However, Jardine Matheson alone lagged behind. On Wednesday, Hong Kong stocks had many twists and turns. As a result, three popular stocks rose slightly, while the rest were average. Foreign stocks were sold one after another, resulting in a decline. On Thursday, Hong Kong stocks initially showed a hovering state, but in the end, due to the loosening of credit, the buying trend resumed, and prices rose across the board. Foreign stocks were excited and buying was strong. Hong Kong and Shanghai Hotels rose even more. On Friday, due to the rise in the price of gold, morale was boosted, and the market momentum of Hong Kong stocks suddenly flourished. Foreign stocks rose together. At the weekend, Hong Kong stocks were initially favorable and then tired. As a result, each fell by about half a percent. Foreign stocks continued to rise. Jardine Matheson called out 13,500 yuan, Ewo almost broke the 6,000 yuan mark, and Asia also rose by more than 10%.</p>
<p>Raw Yarn: In the past week, initially due to the sluggishness of gold and stocks, the Shanghai raw yarn market was flooded with inventory. The actual sales of major customers such as Guangdong and Hubei were weak, and bulls were uneasy and closed out in large quantities. Short sellers took advantage of the situation to put pressure on prices. On Tuesday, 20-count special double horses reached a low point of 950,000, and warehouse receipts were as low as 920,000. Then, due to the excessive drop in prices in the past two days, gold rose again, and the current sales of customers turned for the better, causing retail short sellers to make profits and cover their positions, and prices slowly recovered. In addition to special double horses, which fell by 90,000 compared to the previous Saturday, the prices of other yarns fell by 50,000 to 60,000.</p>
<p>Cloth Market: Customers and door shops still have no large purchases, but the market price has fallen to the bottom, so the market situation has not changed much during the week. As a result, the situation was mediocre compared to the previous Saturday.</p>
<p>Cotton Market: The actual purchases of manufacturers are poor, and the transactions between the same industries are still lively. However, because there is a source of foreign cotton from time to time, and manufacturers are increasingly waiting and seeing, the market is difficult to revitalize, and it has fallen by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan compared to the previous Saturday.</p>
<p>Rice and Grain: Rice prices rose little last week due to the abundant supply of goods, and the situation was relatively stable. Edible oil continued downstream, and only stopped falling and turned upward after Thursday. Due to the continued auction of enemy and puppet properties by the Enemy and Puppet Property Administration Bureau, the situation for sugar deteriorated. Flour was average, and miscellaneous grains rose and fell mixed.</p>
<h3>Comments from Industry Insiders - The Reason for the Decline of Cotton Yarn and Cloth - Increased Production, but Sales Cannot Keep Up</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Recently, the cotton yarn and cloth market has changed from enthusiastic to indifferent. Industry insiders have discussed the reasons for the sluggish market, as follows: (1) At the end of last year, due to the manufacture of military uniforms, a large number of cloth was handled, and speculators generally expected that the market would definitely rise, so they searched for and purchased it. At this time, the amount of goods received was not strong, and the spot goods were thin, and there was not enough to meet the market at one time. The market price of cotton yarn and cloth rose in a straight line, and all cotton yarn and cloth merchants made a lot of profit and were very happy. (2) Unexpectedly, the price was high, and the demand shrank. The markets in all regions formed an upside-down situation. The market price of grey cloth in Qingdao, Jinan, and Yantai was even cheaper than that in Shanghai. Not only could Shanghai goods not go there, but the goods from that place were also shipped to Shanghai. As for Hankou, Sichuan, and other places, the market price was also not good. Therefore, traffickers stopped moving forward. However, Guangzhou's commerce was more prosperous, and cotton yarn and cloth could still make a profit when transported there. However, there was a lack of ships. If a large number of goods arrived in Guangdong, the market would also be affected. (3) Since the opening of the foreign exchange market, the trend has been stable, the import of American cotton has been enthusiastic, and the price is quite cheap. With this sufficient raw material, the factory is working hard to resume production, working day and night, so that materials have increased. The cotton yarn and cloth of state-owned and private enterprises are also opening up as much as possible. The long-term withered market has sufficient chips, and those who hoard and store goods are cautious. The market situation of cotton yarn and cloth is slowing down. (4) At the beginning of this year's spring, the China Textile Construction Corporation opened sales dates for cotton yarn and cloth. Cloth merchants and yarn shops were eager to crowd. More than 400 companies registered for cotton yarn, and more than 1,400 companies registered for cotton cloth. Now it is very different from the past. Recently, the market price of commodities has been rising due to rumors, but cotton yarn and cloth are still calm. After the prosperity and disgrace of the market, we should think about the supply and demand, not just the speculation. The following are the high and low prices of cotton yarn and cloth since March:</p>
<h3>Raincoat Materials - Three Changes</h3>
<p>Post-War - Defense Emerges</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The manufacture of raincoats began around the first year of the Republic of China and gradually expanded thereafter. The earliest customers were the Qingdao and Hankou groups. At that time, the materials were all British-made double-sided open-water taste and single-sided open-water taste, double-sided yarn and single-sided yarn, ordinary stripes and mercerized stripes, etc. There were only a few colors, such as navy blue, blue-gray, and yellow-gray. In the tenth year of the Republic of China, due to the increase in the urban population, the demand became more and more prosperous. The new colors of imported goods included thin-skinned elephant skin lining, such as blue, red, purple, green, yuan, navy, gray, yellow, cyan, plaid, and polka dots, etc. Women's raincoats became more popular. Ordinary stripes and mercerized stripes were all eliminated. At this time, there were specialized stores that made raincoat materials, including Hui Kang, Yi Kang, Chang Ji, Heng Yuan, Rong Changde, etc. Around the twentieth year of the Republic of China, there was another change. The sales of this group increased day by day. Among the Western goods that arrived were Bao Bielin, and among the Eastern goods that arrived in Shanghai for dumping were yarn surface and thin suede leather paint, etc. The goods from the past, except for the single-sided open-water taste, which was still popular, were gradually eliminated. In the twenty-eighth year of the Republic of China, there was a third change. Due to the outbreak of war between China and foreign countries, the arrival of imported goods disappeared, and the inventory in this port was sold out one after another. All kinds of raincoat materials were mostly out of stock, but the public still needed them, so Chinese people researched and invented rubber yarn raincoat cloth. However, due to raw materials and environmental relations, it soon stopped again. The rain-proof cloth that is widely sold today came into being at this time. Whether it is Chinese or Western raincoats, they all flock to it. It is popular throughout Shanghai and the Beijing-Hangzhou area. The manufacturers of rain-proof cloth that are famous are Yousheng, Da Ming, Da Chang, Da Gong, Shuang Lu, etc. The raincoat manufacturers that are famous are Rong Changde Flying Dragon Brand, Xiang Sheng Shuang Ma Brand, and Shanghai's Elephant Brand. Yongxin Ai Di Kai was also well-known at first, but now it has been reduced in color because Da Chang does not supply cloth. In addition, there are also Meilun Guangming spun silk glass raincoats, which are popular among women for their light weight, low price, and beauty, and their sales are also wide.</p>

<h3>Universities in the Nine Northeastern Provinces Systematically Being Taken Over and Reorganized</h3>
<p>[Dahua News Agency, Shenyang] Universities in the nine northeastern provinces are being systematically taken over. Northeastern University has moved back to Shenyang. In addition to the original College of Liberal Arts and College of Science, the Fengtian Industrial University of the puppet Manchukuo period will be merged into the College of Engineering, and the private Fengtian Business College will be renamed the College of Law and Commerce. The newly established Changchun University, in addition to establishing its own College of Liberal Arts and College of Science, will also merge the Xinjing College of Law and Politics of the puppet Manchukuo era into the new College of Law and Commerce, the Xinjing Industrial University into the College of Engineering, the Xinjing Livestock and Veterinary University into the College of Agriculture, and the Xinjing Medical University into the College of Medicine. Binjiang University, in addition to its own College of Liberal Arts and College of Science, will also merge the Harbin College of the puppet Manchukuo era into the College of Commerce, the Harbin Agricultural University into the College of Agriculture, the Harbin Industrial University into the College of Engineering, and the Harbin Medical University into the College of Medicine. Other universities, such as the Shidao University and Shizhe College of the puppet Manchukuo era, will be merged and reorganized into the National Northeast Normal College. The Xinjing Shidao University will be reorganized into the National Northeast Women's Normal College, and the Xing'an Medical College will be reorganized into the National Xing'an Medical College. As for the Jiamusi Medical College, the Bei'an Reclamation Medical College, and the Changjing Reclamation Hospital, because they were all established by the Japanese, they have now been closed. The Beiman College, established by the Russians, is now divided into two departments: industry and commerce. The Shengjing Medical University, established by the church, has a high reputation and is allowed to be established as a private college. In addition, the Continental Scientific Institute, established by the enemy and puppet regime, is large in scale and perfectly equipped, and has now been taken over by the Academia Sinica and the Northeast Education Guidance Committee.</p>
<h3>Private Schools Collecting Fees for a Second Time</h3>
<p>The Federation of Primary and Secondary Schools Issues a Statement</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Mr. Jiang Jizhou, the person in charge of the Federation of Private Primary and Secondary Schools in this city, made the following statement to our newspaper reporter regarding the second fee collection by private schools:</p>
<p>Fee Standards</p>
<p>The fee amounts for private primary and secondary schools in this city for this semester were determined in January of this year, with reference to the treatment of teachers in city schools, using a monthly salary of 16,000 yuan for primary school teachers and 44,000 yuan for secondary school teachers as the standard. At that time, the cost of living index was 520 times that of the 26th year of the Republic (1937), but when the schools began collecting fees, the cost of living index had already risen to more than 1,800 times, and now it has exceeded 2,000 times. Under the threat of extreme poverty, more than 8,000 teachers in the city's schools urgently need relief. The main countermeasures, such as expanding the education budget and determining subsidies for private schools, are what teachers unanimously hope for, and the Provisional Council has also made the same resolution. However, it is feared that this plan will be difficult to implement this semester. As for the Teacher Appreciation Donation, the intention is very good, but the amount of money needed by private schools is too large, and it is a drop in the bucket.</p>
<p>Principles of Continued Collection</p>
<p>Therefore, after repeated discussions, and in a meeting convened by the Director of Education, the following decisions were made: (1) Each school may collect tuition fees once more, and the amount shall not exceed the miscellaneous fees collected by each school last time in principle, but no more than 12,000 yuan for primary schools, no more than 16,000 yuan for junior high schools, and no more than 20,000 yuan for senior high schools. (2) Students from poor families should have their tuition fees reduced or waived, and the number of free places in each school should not be less than 20%. (3) In addition to the necessary expenses of each school, all the tuition fees collected shall be used as teachers' salaries in principle. It is verified that teachers in private schools in this city have never neglected their studies for a single day under any hardship. This noble educational spirit should be appreciated by all parents, who will be happy to provide financial assistance.</p>
<h3>100 Free Primary Schools Plan</h3>
<p>Announced by the Tianjin Relief Branch</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 13th] In order to benefit out-of-school children from poor families, the local relief branch announced a plan for 100 free primary schools, with each school also establishing a milk station to provide milk for impoverished children in need.</p>

<h3>School Construction in the National Education Demonstration Zone Plans to Raise 10,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>[Our City News] The School Building Committee of the National Education Demonstration Zone in this city held its first meeting yesterday. Chairman Shan Qu Yue appointed Zhang Qiwen, Lu Guanliu, Guo Qixun, Yao Deming, and Shen Wenxin as standing committee members. It was resolved to raise 10,000 yuan for the construction of the Central National School building and the Lihang Middle School building.</p>
<h3>14 Schools Jointly Appeal for the Nianhua School Building to be Seized</h3>
<p>[Ta Kung Pao News] Fourteen schools in this city, including Aiguo, Mailun, Qingxin, and Chengzhong, stated that the Kunming Road school building of Nianhua Girls' High School was taken over and forcibly occupied by the Shanghai Aircraft Repair Factory of the Aviation Committee for eight months, and has not been completely evacuated, causing obstacles to the restoration movement of Nianhua Girls' High School. Yesterday, they jointly appealed to the Municipal Education Bureau to forward their appeal to the Municipal Government and the Aviation Committee and other agencies to take effective measures and order the factory to evacuate as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang University Once Went on Strike Demanding the School Increase Professors' Salaries</h3>
<p>(Our Newspaper, Hangzhou) The salaries of faculty and staff at National Zhejiang University were recently only 20,000 yuan in basic living allowance, plus a coefficient of 70 times that amount. At a time when prices are rising sharply, it is difficult to maintain a livelihood. The entire faculty and staff of the school discussed the issue of requesting improved treatment at Luoyuan in West Lake (the site of the school's normal college) the night before last, and resolved to take steps. It was decided that, in addition to sending a telegram to Principal Zhu at the Zunyi Main Campus, urging the Ministry of Education to quickly improve the treatment of the faculty and staff of Zhejiang University, the school should increase the treatment proportionally to the cost of living index and quickly allocate arrears. On the 11th, a three-day school-wide strike was implemented. Lu Jina, the person in charge of the school in Hangzhou, in order to take into account the students' studies, invited all faculty and staff to a symposium in the school's conference room on Daxue Road, expressing that the salaries owed to the faculty and staff would be temporarily advanced from the repatriation funds, and asked them to take into account the students' studies and immediately resume classes. As for the request to increase treatment and improve living conditions, the school would negotiate with the Ministry of Education and then resolve the matter. The faculty and staff, believing that the various requests had yielded concrete results, resumed classes in the afternoon and awaited the Ministry of Education's response. (Butterfly)</p>
<h3>Qingbai Beats Jewish 6-0; Donghua Beats Italian Overseas Chinese 4-0, Each Wins Right to Mayor's Cup Soccer Final; The Battle Between Yiyuan and Dongyi Almost Ended Unpleasantly</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Mayor's Cup soccer semi-finals were held in Jiaoyuan in the morning and Yiyuan in the afternoon. Both games were opened in cold weather, and the audience was not as crowded as expected. The Qing-Jewish match in the morning was quite sparsely attended. The results of the two games were Qingbai winning Jewish 6-0. Jewish players Fu En and Olivelia did not play, weakening their strength considerably. Donghua defeated Italian Overseas Chinese 4-0. After Chen Mingzhe broke into the empty net in the 15th minute of the second half, the Italian Overseas Chinese believed that Han Longhai had touched the ball with his hand earlier, but the referee ruled the goal valid. The Italian players were angry and implemented a strike-like soccer game, allowing Donghua to score at will. Donghua then scored two more goals.</p>
<p>Defeated Jewish</p>
<p>Qingbai still used the lineup from the match against Donghua yesterday, determined to win. Not only did the Jewish team fail to bring in the star player, but Fu En and Olivelia also failed to appear, making their defeat inevitable. After the start, there was a melee for a long time. Di Ting broke through on the left, and Little Gu scored the first goal. Soon after, Qiu Ting crossed again, and A Kui scored from 25 yards, resulting in another goal. The score was 2-0 at halftime. Although the Jewish team tried to recover in the second half, their strength was not as good as Qingbai's, and the Qingbai defenders did not allow any gaps. In the 10th minute, Qiu Ting hooked the ball from the left side, and it actually went directly into the net. Fei Chunhua made a wonderful cut on the right, and Lazy Niu headed the ball, sending it into the net, making the score 4-0. At this time, Qingbai was completely in control. Little Fei actually scored two goals in the last 10 minutes, and Qingbai won Jewish 6-0.</p>
<p>Defeated Italian Overseas Chinese</p>
<p>Donghua did not have A Dai Youren play yesterday, so Longhai was in the center, and Youliang assisted him. Mingzhe was on the right wing, and the position of Youren was tried by veteran Xin Quan, which was also an ideal change. Donghua took the offensive as soon as the game started, but it was not successful. The Italian Overseas Chinese counterattacked, and the game was in a seesaw situation. At the end of the first half, both sides did not score. The battle became more intense in the second half, and there were many highlights. In the 15th minute, Li Yao crossed from the left, Longhai rushed up and met with McNiti. The goal was empty, and Mingzhe rushed up and pushed the ball into the net. The Italian Overseas Chinese believed that Longhai had used his hand to hit the ball and could not accept the goal. However, referee Chen Jixiang ruled it valid. The Italian players then left the field together. Fortunately, the Standing Committee and Qu Yaokang explained, and they re-entered the field to play. However, the Italian Overseas Chinese actually played a strike-like soccer game and coped casually. Before long, Li Yao scored a goal, and Han Longhai scored twice, ending the game hastily. Donghua won Italian Overseas Chinese 4-0. This spirit of the Italian Overseas Chinese players is really not a good example and is deeply regrettable.</p>

<h3>"Guangzhou's Spring is Warmer than Tokyo's" - An Interview with Japanese War Criminal Tanaka Hisaichi</h3>
<p>— Guangzhou, 5th (Airmail) Our Special Correspondent, Liang Feng</p>
<p>A slightly faded blue sedan carried the reporter through the bustling crowds! It crossed the majestic Haizhu Iron Bridge, reached Henan, and gradually departed the noisy city, hurrying towards our destination - the Japanese War Criminal Detention Center.</p>
<p>It was during the Qingming Festival in the late spring of March, but the climate in the South was as sultry as high summer. However, the reporter's mood remained endlessly excited because today, with the enthusiastic assistance of Colonel Li, the head of the Political Department's Anti-Enemy Broadcasting Team, we were led to interview Tanaka Hisaichi, the Japanese Lieutenant General who once commanded the clouds and winds in South China, known as the "King of the South," and who, having been designated a war criminal, was recently detained. He was the Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Southern China Expeditionary Army and Governor-General of Hong Kong.</p>
<p>The car drove for ten minutes on the dusty path, and only after completing a registration procedure were we allowed to drive inside.</p>
<p>Japanese War Criminal Detention Center</p>
<p>This war criminal detention center was originally the Swire warehouse and Watson's soda factory before the war. During the war, it was used by the Japanese as barracks for the Japanese military police and a car repair shop. However, now, one side of the road is piled with broken tanks, cars, and trucks, while the other side has dilapidated and bullet-ridden empty factory buildings. A desolate scene makes one realize the cruelty and horror of war. However, when you enter the buildings inside the war criminal detention center, you have a different feeling because it is located on the banks of the Pearl River; the environment is exceptionally beautiful, spacious, and the air is fresh and pleasant. The war criminals leisurely sat under the shade of the trees; those hiding in the rooms, upon seeing the reporters arrive, crowded out to look, cracking their mouths into strange smiles. As we passed by them, they all stood at attention and saluted. Two of them, familiar with Captain Li, ran over to warmly shake hands and chat with him.</p>
<p>Japanese Military Police Predominate</p>
<p>"There are more than 560 war criminals detained here," Major General Yuan Xiqi, the director of the war criminal detention center, told the reporter. "They are all Japanese, among whom more than 400 are Japanese military police. There are also quite a few high-ranking Japanese officers; three are lieutenant generals: one is Tanaka Hisaichi, one is Kondo Shinpachi, commander of the Japanese 130th Division, and the other is Sue Tomochika, commander of the 104th Division, who was only detained on the 2nd of this month. There are also three major generals: one is Hirano Kiichi, one is Shimokawabe Kenji. These two are both brigade commanders and another is Shigetō Norifumi, a military police commander."</p>
<p>Brought Five Attendants</p>
<p>Director Yuan continued, "They are now living in three separate areas: the generals live together, the military police live together, and the war criminals transferred from various places also live together. Their food ration is 25 taels of rice per day, and the supplementary food allowance is 100 yuan. They can move freely within this area. When war criminals enter, their clothing must be registered, and fingerprints are taken. Books can be read after inspection. Tanaka Hisaichi was only transferred here yesterday (the 4th). Director Zhang of the military headquarters has granted him permission to bring five attendants: an adjutant, a doctor, a nurse, a servant, and a cook."</p>
<p>Japanese-Style Bungalow</p>
<p>After Director Yuan finished speaking, he led the reporter to a Japanese-style bungalow. The house had corridors in the front and back, with three rooms connected in the middle. The first room was occupied solely by Tanaka Hisaichi. The interior was simply furnished, with several thick mats spread in the center and a small stove placed in the middle of the mats. A cloth partition in the left corner formed a dressing room. At this time, Tanaka was on the wide corridor in front, sitting in a rattan chair next to a large round table, looking at the trees, facing the leisurely flowing river surface, in a very relaxed state. After Captain Li conveyed the reporter's purpose, Tanaka hurriedly and humbly stood up to express his welcome, and we sat down around the large round table.</p>
<p>Tanaka is a short and wiry figure. His small body was draped in a Japanese military uniform with the insignia removed. His face was thin, his cheekbones slightly protruding, the corners of his eyes drooped a little, and he wore a pair of tortoiseshell glasses on the bridge of his nose. He had a small mustache on his lips, and was a typical old Japanese soldier. No matter how deliberately he tried to assume an attitude of composure and serenity, he could not conceal his depressed and deep emotions. He is now 58 years old, from Kyushu, Japan, a graduate of the military academy and army university, and has served as an instructor and platoon leader in various Japanese military schools and as a division commander. He has been in South China for more than two years. But he told people that he had not participated in any battles, only in the Xijiang battle in the 32nd year of the Republic. After Japan surrendered, he represented the Japanese army in the South China region to sign the surrender, and served as the head of the Japanese prisoner liaison department. This time, he was arrested as a war criminal on the grounds of directing the killing of downed American airmen and the murder of innocent Chinese civilians.</p>
<p>Extravagant Talk of His Mission</p>
<p>After Director Yuan briefly inquired about Tanaka's life, Tanaka, without waiting for the reporter to ask questions, told Captain Li that he wanted to say a few words to the reporter. Captain Li then voluntarily helped us translate.</p>
<p>"My mission here is to repatriate more than 100,000 Japanese prisoners of war. Now that they can all be transported back to their country before the 15th of this month, my mission will be considered complete." He seemed to not yet know that he had been designated as a war criminal, and spoke at length about his "mission."</p>
<p>"The Japanese prisoners of war in the concentration camps have received the utmost courtesy from your country, for which they are infinitely grateful. They will return with an excellent impression, and they will undoubtedly work hard for future friendly relations between China and Japan. I am thinking of using my status to prepare to write a letter or an article, on behalf of the Japanese people, to thank your country for its generosity and courtesy."</p>
<p>Wants to Read the Three Principles of the People</p>
<p>"Now I feel as if a heavy burden has been lifted, and my mind is as clear as a 'newly washed mirror,' exceptionally serene. I am repenting of everything in the past, which need not be said further. If this old and decrepit body of mine has the opportunity to return to my country, I will do my best to work for future friendly relations between China and Japan. Now, as a war criminal, I am waiting every day for China to recover soon!"</p>
<p>His set of clever words, praise, and prayers were the kind of conversation the reporter expected. When the reporter asked about his life and hobbies, he said that his state of mind was very good, and the place he was staying was as comfortable as a villa. It was just that he had a stomach ailment and wished to exercise and plant more when the weather was sunny. His only hobby was reading. He loved literature, and he also wanted to read the Three Principles of the People. He said it was a pity that his Chinese was not very good, which he considered his greatest regret. He also asked Director Yuan to give him more religious books to read. These words were clearly intended to show that he was a peaceful person, and that his current repentance could erase his past crimes. As for his saying that he wanted to read the Three Principles of the People, this was becoming increasingly skillful.</p>
<p>Admits Past Mistakes</p>
<p>When the reporter asked about his feelings on the Chinese battlefield over the past two years, he only said, "Although your country has suffered greatly from this long period of warfare, I believe that Tokyo and Osaka were even more miserable during the war! However, as the saying goes, 'no discord, no concord.' In the past, I only heard about China, but I didn't understand it. But now I have a thorough understanding of China. We admit all the mistakes of the past, and I now sympathize with your country very much. Since the September 18th Incident, you have been receiving anti-Japanese education, while the Japanese have been receiving education in aggression, but now all of that is in the past. I only hope that the friendship between China and Japan will be re-established, and I even hope that China can pull Japan up, because Japanese culture is entirely derived from China!"</p>
<p>The Pain of a Broken Family</p>
<p>After he spoke this specious theory, the reporter further asked about his family situation.</p>
<p>"I have two sons: the elder one has already died in battle. Now I only have a young son who is thirteen years old. Last February, I received a letter from them, but later my home in Tokyo was destroyed by Allied planes, so I have no way of knowing how they are now." He said with what seemed like endless emotion.</p>
<p>"The environment here is so peaceful. When you see the leisurely river water and the coming and going of ships every day, what are your feelings?" the reporter asked curiously.</p>
<p>"Green Willows, Not Red Flowers"</p>
<p>"When I see the red sun setting every day, with the setting sun reflecting on the Pearl River, I am very happy. So every day when the tide is high, I sometimes can't help but feel some emotions and want to write a few poems, but I haven't started writing them yet." He hung a bitter smile on his face, and then said again, "I admire Lao Tzu's doctrine, the so-called 'green willows, not red flowers,' my state of mind and fate are like 'flowing water and floating clouds,' I can only let nature take its course."</p>
<p>At that time, he lowered his head, his eyes fixed on a copy of "Japanese Drama Theory" by Niizeki Ryozou lying in front of him. After a while, he raised his head again, looking at the distant river surface, seeming to be lost in thought. Finally, the reporter asked about his feelings after receiving the news of Japan's surrender. He said, "It is really difficult to express in words; the complex thoughts at that time cannot be conveyed in words." After a slight pause, he sighed softly and said, "However, after the ceasefire, very few of our officers and soldiers deserted, and they were able to strictly observe discipline. They have all returned now. However, whether they will be able to see their families when they return, whether they will have food to eat, I am afraid it is still hard to say!"</p>
<p>Seeing the "Tiger of South China"</p>
<p>Captain Li then led the reporter to the second room, where the two lieutenant generals mentioned earlier lived. At that time, the two were playing Go. Captain Li said that the Japanese army has what is called "one dragon, two tigers." The so-called "dragon" is in North China, one tiger is Yamashita Tomoyuki, the "Tiger of Malaya," and the other tiger is Kondo Shinpachi, the "Tiger of South China" who is currently playing Go. They are famous for being good at fighting.</p>
<p>Passing through the third room, there were the living quarters for the three Japanese major generals. Shimokawabe Kenji, who had a pair of "Hitomoto" mustaches, was there engaging in drawing as a pastime. When he discovered the reporter passing by, he laughed loudly and said, "Do you think my two big mustaches look like a typical Japanese warlord?" In reality, he was probably forcing a smile.</p>
<p>About ten minutes later, our car unknowingly crossed the majestic Haizhu Iron Bridge again. We all looked down at the river water under the bridge, gently caressing the bridge piers. Captain Li immediately recalled what happened yesterday. He said that yesterday, when he was escorting Tanaka Hisaichi to the war criminal detention center, he was also on this bridge. Tanaka was moved and said, "Guangzhou's spring is warmer than Tokyo's!"</p>

<h3>Where are China's Technical Talents Going?</h3>
<p>— Yang Mou</p>
<p>Facing the ruins left to us by this war, everyone will feel a serious sense of responsibility. No matter how much hardship and suffering we have endured in the flames of the War of Resistance, what is coming now is definitely not enjoyment and comfort, but we should use redoubled perseverance to endure and overcome all difficulties, and rebuild our country on the ruins.</p>
<p>Our country is now like a body covered in wounds, yearning for the rise of all the people. The responsibility that history bestows on every Chinese descendant is heavy, and the opportunity that history bestows on every Chinese descendant to develop their talents is also unparalleled.</p>
<p>Let's take a look at the newspapers:</p>
<p>Railroads lack sleepers, rails, and locomotives; shipping lacks ships; aviation lacks airplanes; and there is a widespread shortage of fuel. Factories, like hungry beasts, are supposed to be working hard to process and move forward, but instead, they are collapsing. Labor strikes are frequent, the number of unemployed is soaring, materials are scarce, and prices are skyrocketing...</p>
<p>So many difficult destinies have befallen our country.</p>
<p>According to reports, in order to repair the southern section of the Jinpu Railway, the authorities have decided to dismantle the Wuhu Railway near Nanjing. As soon as this news spread, food prices in Nanjing rose in a straight line. How heavy does such news of robbing Peter to pay Paul make your heart feel? And at the National Highway Conference, the universal complaint was the lack of materials and the lack of funding. Six months have passed since the victory, but after closely observing all the situations that are not on track, one truly feels like weeping but having no tears. The terrifying giant hand of war has already been driven away by us, but the giant hand of post-war economic panic has already reached in.</p>
<p>This is an extremely difficult situation! This is an extremely difficult situation! Only by overcoming this difficult situation can we reach the light. If we fail to overcome it, we will forever sink into the abyss of darkness. Of course, we can also use external forces, but remember, what "external forces" hope for us is definitely not simply the prosperity of China; they also have their own vested interests. The more we use external forces, the heavier the burden we ourselves bear.</p>
<p>Where are China's technical talents going?</p>
<p>Of course, we cannot deny that many technical talents have persevered through hardship and made immortal contributions to the War of Resistance in the rear. However, many, many more, driven by the necessities of life and constrained by various circumstances, have expressed discouragement towards China's construction and turned to the speculative business world. This is not an accidental phenomenon; it is a widespread phenomenon. Many, many trained technical talents have sacrificed what they have learned and are rushing to speculative paths. Of course, in our country, which is poor in everything, being a technical talent is indeed a very difficult job. Of course, the treatment that the country gives to technical talents is far from enough to support a family. Of course, the country has never had clear methods for the appointment and promotion of technical talents, and everything is always a mess. Of course, the country has no guarantee for the positions of technical talents. - Even if all the reasons are true and sufficient, they cannot be used as an excuse to avoid being a technical talent.</p>
<p>Because, because the country is calling you, the country needs you!</p>
<p>The fate of technical talents themselves is inherently difficult. They have to create from scratch, and they have to grow from thorny ground. No hardship can threaten them; their history is entirely a history of creativity and struggle. Now that the country is calling, what reason is there to refuse?</p>
<p>What our country needs now is only "repairing bridges and paving roads." We only hope to repair the destroyed roads and restart the factories that have been shut down, but no one can deny that there are many, many more arduous and greater tasks.</p>
<p>Chinese technical talents? Where are you going? Stand up straight and embark on the difficult path? Or continue to evade?</p>
<p>What history has bestowed is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. We only have the right to accept, not the right to refuse! Moreover, this is not just a right, but also an obligation. As the country restores its strong and majestic appearance from broken ruins, should we, as citizens, still be concerned about the gains and losses of individual interests?</p>
<p>In the flames of war, we have spent eight years of the worst destiny. Now, new life is growing. Listen to the call of the country! Chinese technical talents, I will repeat once more, this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity!</p>
<p>Zhan Tianyou and Fan Xudong have pioneered the way for us. By reviewing their history, you can know how heavy the burden that every Chinese technical talent bears is.</p>
<h3>Rich Assets of the Northeast</h3>
<p>— Xian</p>
<p>The Northeast covers an area of ​​approximately 500,000 square miles, accounting for one-seventh of the country. The population is 43 million, accounting for one-tenth of the country's population. However, the assets it possesses are equal to the sum of all other regions. A comparison of the assets of the Northeast (pre-war) with the mainland is as follows: Northeast Mainland Number of factories 3,900 3,850 Railway length 7,590 miles 7,319 miles Steel production (annual) 450,000 tons 50,000 tons Coal (annual) 15,000,000 tons 25,000,000 tons</p>
<p>As for the undeveloped resources of the Northeast (oil, gold, manganese, tungsten, iron, coal, etc.), it is estimated to be approximately 15,000,000,000 tons. (US New York Times Overseas Weekly)</p>
<h3>Introduction to Business Management</h3>
<p>— Xu Baiyi</p>
<p>V. Business Cycle</p>
<p>Regardless of the type of business, in addition to striving for a sound organization, one must also take into account the environment, because no business can exist apart from the environment.</p>
<p>In fact, there are two ways to deal with the relationship between business and the environment: one is to adapt to the environment, and the other is to create the environment. In terms of the ease or difficulty of implementation, adapting to the environment is certainly not easy, but creating the environment is even more difficult.</p>
<p>In terms of the environment that should be considered, the most important is the business cycle. This can be illustrated with charts. Every manufacturer should have accurate statistics on the total sales, total production, and total profits for each year, and then draw them into statistical charts, so that they can be seen at a glance.</p>
<p>In the statistical table, you can see the upward or downward trend. The trend from good to bad is gradually moving towards recession, and the change from bad to good is a turning point. If a manager uses the chart, he can see the trend of business. During the period of decline, he should try to save the situation, and don't wait until the last step before trying to find a solution, which will be more laborious. When the situation is improving day by day, pay attention to the possible changes at all times, and proceed with a certain step. If you are blindly aggressive, then a situation of being too big to fail will occur. The number of employees will increase, and the equipment will also increase, but as a result, sales will be stagnant, which will make capital turnover difficult. At that time, you will have to sell the goods cheaply or painfully lay off employees or reduce salaries, so that the business cannot be operated smoothly.</p>
<p>The United States experienced an unprecedented recession in 1920. The reasons for the recession are as follows:</p>
<p>1. At that time, banks over-loaned and suddenly contracted, so industry and commerce could not use bank overdrafts, so they could not develop forward and could only be conservative. Some industrial and commercial enterprises had to sell goods cheaply in order to repay bank loans, and because of cheap sales, they had to reduce profits, or even lose money.</p>
<p>2. Transportation agencies were temporarily disrupted due to the war, so goods could not be smoothly delivered to various places, and there was a surplus phenomenon after production.</p>
<p>3. The rise in the cost of living made the general income unable to keep up with the general prices. They could only stop buying, and after the retail stores' business was dull, the producers' goods could not be sold smoothly.</p>
<p>4. General hoarding in the market, hoping to obtain a good price, so raw materials and manufactured products were hoarded. Once the recession started, they were thrown out one after another, which was unfavorable to general industry and commerce.</p>
<p>When one of the above situations exists, you should try to seek a remedy to save the future of industry and commerce, and never wait until you temporarily find a solution, you will feel that it is too late in fact. In terms of China's situation, during the war, many industrial and commercial enterprises hoarded goods in large quantities and greatly increased their capital. After the victory, they will encounter unprecedented difficulties.</p>
<p>In order to handle the business smoothly, we must train ourselves to see the possible changes in the business situation in advance. We can use the recession era in the United States in 1920 to explain. A person who understands the business cycle can foresee the future crisis as early as 1919. Because before 1919, many industrial and commercial enterprises were in mass production, and because they needed working capital, they all overdrafted from banks, which resulted in the banks' lending amount having to be limited, so the amount was reduced and the interest rate was increased. A discerning manager can see this early and quickly balance his production and sales.</p>
