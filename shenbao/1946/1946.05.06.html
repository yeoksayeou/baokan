<p>〔中央社南京五日電〕蔣主席於五日出席首都各界慶祝還都大會，對全國同胞致訓，原詞如下：全國軍民同胞們，今天是我們國父廿五年前在廣州成立革命政府的紀念日，而我們國民政府亦於今日還都南京了。我們對日八年抗戰，賴我全國同胞始終一致，擁護抗戰國策，服從中央命令，百折不回，再接再厲，浴血犧牲，歷久彌堅，卒能獲得今日最後勝利，而且取消了一切不平等條約，滌除了我們中華民族百年來的國恥。今日，中正與我們同胞仍能在首都相見，聚首一堂，這是何等欣慰，實在是我們中華民國最値得紀念的一天。但是回想到民國廿六年十二月十三日南京淪陷時，首都同胞慘遭大屠殺的悲劇，我們就應該痛定思痛，時時不忘我們八年來在敵人鐵蹄之下所受的奴隸，牛馬，暗無天日生活更不能不驚惕黽勉，自立自强了。尤其是十五年前九一八東北潘陽被侵之時，整個民族的奇恥大辱，更應深切牢記，作為我中華民族世世代代永久的歷史敎訓。同胞們，所以今日政府還都，我以爲只能爲表示我們對日抗戰的結束，就是我們國民政府抗戰到底的國策，率領全體軍民同胞犧牲奮鬥得到一個勝利，但是我們今日瀋陽雖已收復，而東北整個的行政與主權的完整，還須要我們全國同胞爲國家，爲民族精誠合作，繼續的勞力奮勉，來保持我們最後勝利光榮的戰果。惟有如此，方能安慰我們八年來為抗戰革命而犧牲的軍民，同胞在天之靈。國民政府今後仍秉持國父遺敎和國民革命一貫的精神，始終領導着我們全國軍民同胞向前邁進，實現三民主議，完成抗戰建國的使命，幼望我全國同胞仍能以已往抗戰必勝的信心，來負起今後建國必成的大業。但是，我們全國同胞應該澈底認識建國的工作要比抗戰更加艱鉅，更加痛苦，然而，我們建國的工作固然艱雖，而民族的意志恰是完全自由了，所以我們建國的生活雖苦猶樂。總之，我們在此勝利還都歡聲沸騰之中，撫今思昔，更覺我們獲得勝利之艱難建國機會之可貴，務希我全體同胞同心一德，實事求是，人人以刻苦耐勞篤實踐履自矢以共同一致，互助合作相勉，務使我中華民旅黃帝子孫永永遠遠不再受過去八年間那樣異族侵凌蹂躪的慘禍與恥辱。因之，我今日對我同胞特別提出幾個要求，來作我們今後共同一致勞力建國的方針，就是（一）要戒浪費，（二）要尙節約，（三）要明禮義，（四）要知廉恥，（五）要負責任，（六）要守紀律。中正夫婦今日承受我們同胞這樣熟烈的歡迎和擁護，實在不勝慚愧之至，甚恐辜負了同胞的期望，只有以往日抗戰的精神，朝警夕惕，追隨全體同胞，擁護國民政府來建立三民主義統一獨立平等自由富强康樂的新中國，用副我全國同胞擁護之至意，恭祝全國軍民同胞抗戰勝利萬歲。又蔣主席五五國府還都之日，午後八時親臨中央廣播電台，將五日晨在首都各界慶祝還都大會中所致訓詞，復向全國軍民廣播。以資激勵。</p>

<h3 id="c8">東江共軍迄未允撤退　粵仍積極整軍中　張發奎氏報吿行營工作 <a href="#c8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>〔本報廣州五日電〕廣州行營主任張發奎，昨（四日）在行營官舍舉行雞尾酒會招待記者，報吿行營最近及今後工作</p>
<p>嚴重糧荒</p>
<p>張主任首報吿關於目前粵省糧荒嚴重問題，略謂：此次糧荒實較民國三十一年時尤甚，然過去因軍糧負擔過重，致影響民糧缺乏，故於四月一日前，已將所有日俘日僑韓僑悉數運走，現軍糧由十三萬大包減爲六千五百大包，軍糧減少即可使民糧增加。</p>
<p>東江共軍</p>
<p>次述及東江中共武裝人員撤退問題，曾經秉承委座指示三原則，與中共代表協商進行，並一切予以協助，不惜委曲求全，以求和平統一，中共方面又以種種枝節問題，迄今仍未允出發。現美方代表幼甚感苦悶，故彼本人甚願中共方面，能明白表示，究欲如何。</p>
<p>東北問題</p>
<p>張主任並對東北問題發表感想稱：東北問題已非政府與中共問題，實爲國際問題，蘇軍侮在一地撤退，必等共軍到達，而中共則極力反對美國協助國軍北運，其實國軍接收東北，係屬天經地義，中共一反對者，無非欲使東北特殊化，使既成事實，故將來東北可能演變爲第二「滿洲國，」此屬國家主種問題，吾人實不能忽視。</p>
<p>整軍工作</p>
<p>張主任復談及行營對軍隊整編工作，正積極進行，現決定由本月十日起開始整編，六月底即可完成，將先由軍變師再由師縮為兩旅，十一月前即可縮三分之二以上，可見政府對軍令政令貫澈，將有事實可證，然共黨究竟遵照協定縮軍與否，則不可知，因共黨報紙尙未有縮軍新聞記載也。</p>
<p>今後工作</p>
<p>最後張主任報吿行營今後工作稱：謂今後首爲轄區內軍隊之整訓，次爲監督地方政府澈底澄淸史治，掃除貪汚，並極力解除人民一切痛苦，甚望輿論界亦負督促責任。</p>

<p>〔本報漢口五日電〕徐永昌·周恩來及美方代表白魯德三氏工，五日午分由京平飛抵漢，晚間應程主任潛歡宴，並進行會談。聞三氏將於六日赴宣化店視察。又中共駐漢代表鄭紹文，五日晚曾宴武漢執行小組。</p>
<p>〔本報南京五日電〕三人小組政府代表徐永昌，中共代表周恩來曁共軍參謀陸童生，翻譯張文達，五日晨十時聯袂乘機飛漢，聞將會同美方代表白魯德將軍至宣化店等地鄂中衝突區，調査當地實況，以便進行調處。現政府及中共雙方均稱：鄂中祗有小衝突，無大規模戰事。</p>

<h3 id="c16">從農業看世界看中國 <a href="#c16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>— 程兆熊</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>一般人目前對世黑問題之認識，大抵着眼見於經濟，惟有從經濟上才可以看出世界問題的來踪去迹。賢本主義和社會主義都是經濟的產物，並將始於經濟終於經濟。而且大規模的集中的機器生產，就是這時代的經濟特色，同時這一特色又造成了現世界的五光十色和五花八門。</p>
<p>可是目前世界問題的解決，不能不同時着眼於人性。社會的改革須牽涉到制度的改革，制度的改革終於也需要牽涉到人生的文革。而所謂人性的改革，其實就是人性的復活。有人性的復活，方有心靈的　覺。</p>
<p>誰不知道現世界是物質的世界呢？可是當你要肯定這物質的世界時，你總得要賦予這物質的世界以精神的意義呀！這就是所謂心靈的醒覺。</p>
<p>讓都市田園化，同時又讓農業工業化，終於讓一切有了土的氣息，如此，一個世界，又一個世界，將使世界畢竟是不同了。心靈的醒覺，人性的復活，這是一個新的要求，這是一個好的要求。</p>
<p>世界問題是很複雜的，而中國問題更複雜。對於中國問題之認識，應特別着眼於歷史和文化。這理由很簡單，因爲誰都知道中國是一個特別有歷史和文化的民族。</p>
<p>中國所以能成功如此的中國，是有四個條件：一是亞洲特有的地理環境；二是農業；三是漢字；四是儒家學說。「以中國爲一人，以天下爲一家，」直到今天，我們還離不了這壞的儒家學說。「會內外之道也，故時措之宜也。」——儒家學說之於中國以至世界，在賦物質以精神意義上，是一直有用的。所謂着眼於文化，就應當着眼於此。</p>
<p>中國向後看，誰都知道歷史是悠長的；然則向前看呢？又誰道不是遙遠的嗎？所謂着眼於歷史，這實在是說，要從歷史上茁長一種理想主義。我們要提倡理想主義。中國在目前，應該是處在一種理想主義的大時代裏，而不當狗泥於淺薄的現實主義！</p>
<p>說到中國問題之解決，針對着經濟，我們自然要着眼於生產。生產，科學生產，機器生產，這在中國顯然是第一個需要。</p>
<p>人人都說，我們需要現代化；一點也不錯，我們是需要現代化；十分需要現代化。帶社會意義的工業化，這對於呻吟於資本主義鐵蹄之下已逾百年的中國，實是起死回生的良劑。這意思就是說中國的現代化，乃中國自救自活之道和更新更生之這。</p>
<p>只是從中國所特有的歷史和文化看，中國是有一種歷史的使命和文化的使命的。所謂歷史的使命，就是從中國歷史中所茁長之理想主義之究成。所謂文化的使命，就是賦物質以精神的意義，或直截了當說，賦「物」以「神」。淵明有詩：「義神去我久，舉世少復眞；汲汲魯中叟，彌縫使其醇。」在這樣一種意味上，我們不僅要現代化，而且要超現代化，這就是所謂後來居上。</p>
<p>工業化，工業之分散，工業之移植於農村，和農業。工業化，以及田園都市等等，這是我們一串的理想。我們如其能讓這些都見之於事實，這便是超現代化！亦惟有這樣，才可以免除那植根於游牧民族而完成於工業民族者之對人類世界的呑沒！</p>
<p>原子彈一下，每個國家的國防計劃，每個國家的生產計劃，都將要被壓迫着加以澈底的改變了！我們所有以前的打算，自然也應該有所修正了！</p>
<p>因農菜之受破壞和農民之受虐待，而引起的中國農民問題，是目前橫在我們面前必須解決的第一個問題。世界上沒有比中國農民更可憐更可敬的人們！甘地先生絕食時，全世界都予以莫大的注意，寄以莫大的同情，可是目前在中國的農民中，實在不知道已經有多少早做甘地了！在這一意義上，我們更需要現代化，我們又更需要超現代化了。</p>
<p>在現代化的意義上，我們需要民主，我們需要聯合國機構，我們也需要「倫理的」社會。可是在超現代化的意義上，我還可以姑且這麼說，我們是需要向心的民主，文化的大同，和「倫理的」社會。行政要效率化技術化；生活要情翁化農民化；學術要人道化性靈化。舉凡政治的分裂主義，外交的依存主義，和淺薄的功利主義，我們都是要反對的！</p>
<p>所有這些，我們是根據什麽呢？這都是由於我們不願意追求現代文化的黑影，我們也不願意迷戀現代文明的色相。我們要工業，我們又要農業的工業化。我們是大時代的人們，我們要有新的企圖，我們要有好的企圖。</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>目前二次大戰是結束了，聯合國是勝利了，我們也是勝利了。可是勝利之後又怎樣呢？勝利會不會可怕呢？</p>
<p>英名將威靈吞氏在滑鐵盧之戰大勝以後，曾說過：</p>
<p>「除了失收以外，我知道沒有什麽東西會比勝利更可怕！」</p>
<p>可是話雖如此，我們還是綢續着我們的慶祝，不斷的慶祝。我們分明知道現在是不同了，凡事窮則變，變則通，現在應該是變而通了。東方是農業的，東方也是智慧的，現在世界的眼光緊緊地看着東方，也正如我們的眼光緊緊地看着西方。東方與西方終於會是通了。目前西方的第一義是田園都市，而我們則應該是工業鄉村。如其不然，則原子彈毁滅力最的發展，當無底止，所謂勝利之後是什麽，也就難言了。</p>
<p>我們總應當了然於今後之努力，實在是離不了「簡單的活着，高明的想着」之一途徑。一些不必要的糜爛生活，一些不必要的虛空思想，眞應如普希金的詩句所說，「去吧，到那邊去吧！」在這裏我很想讓農村事業，帶世界性的農村事業，作成此次大戰的一種勝利的保障。而且遺感覺到這是一種善良的人們之一種善良的歸宿！</p>
<p>我們的先人會經有一套理想，也有一套辦法，這使中國成了亞洲的唯一大國，更成了世界上僅存的古邦。這理想和這辦法是什麽呢？這就是所謂「寓兵於農。」</p>
<p>只是在目前，這已是不够了。我們應當加上『寓學於農』，和『寓工於農』。我們要憑藉着一種嶄新的農業的科學化和農業的工業化，雖立起我們在原子能世紀裏的農業戰術和農業國防。</p>
<p>農業的枓學是生物的科學，也是生命的科學。</p>
<p>農業的企業是和平的企業，也是防禦的企業。</p>
<p>假如從今天起，以前的人類的世界是物理學的世界，又是戰爭的世界，那末，從今以後，總該是生物學的生命的世界與夫和平防禦的世界了。</p>
<p>現在物理科學的成就已到了原子能的階段，可是生物科學的成就，還沒有　人明白生物的究覺和生命的本質。因此，人們對生物和生命本身的破壞，已是力有所餘，而對生物和生命的把握，則是力有不足。不過憑了物理科學的成就，今後生物科學也會突飛猛進，是可以想像得到的。原子彈的發明，將會是物理學世界和生物學世界的交接點，老實說，今後的世界是不能不變樣了。</p>
<p>論理，今後的世界應該是和平的世界。只不過你要是過分樂觀，那也許又要錯了。因爲和平在以前是美妙的傳說，在今日也還只是一種靈巧的計劃！但，無論如何，今後的世界，會一定是一種防禦的世界。</p>
<p>在生物科學的世界和防禦的世界裏，現在的戰術和國防是要改變的。戰術與國防的憑藉，不外是一種生產的規模。一般說，規模是愈大愈好；可是，像現在人們所企圖着的大規模的集中的工萊生產，從戰爭的觀點上看，這徒然給原子彈作了一個很好的目標，從經濟的觀點上看，這也並不一定就很經濟。汽車大王亨利福特，是現世界一位最偉大的工業家，他曾說過：「按常規說來，一個大工廠的設置並不經濟」，「大規模經營，必須分散國中，以經常岡謀服務大衆。這不使是爲了要獲得最低的成本，而且是爲了那生產大衆中的購買」。</p>
<p>可是最大規模的生產經營，是能够以其他的方式形成的。法國一位名經濟學家杜卜盧依氏曾說着如次的話：「甚至最大的工業組織，也可以由若干獨立的自治的小組織。去構成起來。」</p>
<p>憑了物理科學的已有成就，再加上未來的生物科學的可能成就，我以爲工業化了的農業生產規模，會形成一種比現在大工業力量還更大的力量和更好的力量。有了這更大更好的力量，我們就有資格去欣賞一個生物科學的世界，這就是說一個活生生的世界，一個「雷雨之動滿盈」的世界，一個豐富而不會貧乏的世界，一個長樂永康的世界！</p>
<p>孔子曰：「余欲無言」，又曰，「天何言哉？四時行焉，百物生焉，天何言哉？」這個「四時行百物生」的世界，有日月星辰永遠照耀着，縱然是天有時昏，地有時黑，然終無損於一種永恒的光明。</p>
<p>生命不是機械。說生命是機械，乃現代人類的一種錯覺，不幸的錯覺！生命是一種「流」，—「逝者如斯夫，不舍晝夜！」這在田園都市和工業鄉村裏，這在花園的世界裏，是看得最分明的。</p>
<p>在農業裏在農業的工業化裏，至少會給人們一種好處，這就是不會失掉生命。我們現在是需要生命的科學，我們現在更需要生命的敎育！</p>
<p>我們要工業，也要農業，和工業化的農業，以及田園都市。</p>
<p>「天淸地寗，心安理得！」這將不會是現代的工業的單獨成就，道將是未來的農業的工業化的可能成就，和田園都市的成就。</p>
<p>（三）</p>
<p>在現世界，我們是分明知道，我們不能簡單；我們要是簡單，我們將要很艱難地活着。只是話雖如此，我們終得要簡單化，我們要化繁爲簡，以簡臤繁。我們要物質，我們又要賦物質以精神的意義。我們要速率，我們要進步，工業是進步的產物；可是我們也要進步中的安定。因此，我們要工業，也要農業，又要農業的工業化。</p>
<p>從農業去看世界，我以爲：　（一）人類的禍亂之由來，是在農業之受破壞和農民之受虐待；特別在中國是如此！　（）二　人是歷史與文化的動物，民族和國際問題是歷史與文化問題，而農民則是造成歷史的，農業則是茁長文化的。</p>
<p>（三）世界應成二花園，不應整個祗成一工廠。人應在機器之上便用機器，而不應自身成一機器和爲機器所使用着。</p>
<p>（四）對世界問題之認識，我們要着眼於經濟，可是對世界問題之解決，我們不能不着眼於人性，我們要提倡人性的復活，我們要提倡心靈的醒覺。</p>
<p>（五）對中國問題之認識，尤其應着眼於歷史和文化；對中國問題之解決，則應着眼於生產。同時，農民問題是中國的第一個問題。</p>
<p>（六）在上述之意義上，無疑義的，我們是需要現代化，而又需要超現代化。只有現代化，中國才可以抵擋一種人類新起的災禍；只有超現代化，中國才可以挽救一種人類新起的災禍。</p>
<p>（七）在超現代化的意義上，我們固然需要民主，需要聯合國機構，需要倫理的社會，我們這更需要向心的民主，文化的大同，和倫理的社會。</p>
<p>（八）前西方的第一義是田園都市，而我們則是工業鄕村，農村事業應該是善良的人們之善良的歸宿。</p>
<p>（九）農業的科學是生物的科學，也是生命的科學。世界應該是一個生物學的活生生的世界。在這個世界裏，我們的國防和我們的戰術都應該是嶄新的！</p>
<p>（十）農業科學和農業敎育的成就，終將決定人類的未來，因爲未來會是一種田園都市和一種淡業工業化的境界！</p>
<p>在又一次世界的浩刦和人類的大犧牲之餘，一種黎明前的痛苦，仍然是　上心頭。爲了人類的前程，誰也要正眼看看目前的世界。像以上所說的，隱隱約約地還是在承接一種特有的歷史和文化的傳統。我們要接上一點東西，再建立一點東西，再實際做出一點東西。這話在目前無數人的眼光中，看來也許是不新鮮的，然而這究竟是眞實的，是可以給人受用的。同時，我們又何嘗會忽視人類歷史和文化的交流呢？我們人類目前一個總的目標，是歷史文化的「延續」，可是這「延續」是只能求之於「傳統」與「交流」中的。我根據膝史和文化的觀點去看世界，我知道工業有其未來，農業也一樣有其遠景，要從這農業的遠景裏，我們才可更容易看見自己和自己的世界！</p>
<h3 id="c17">唱呵，南京！ <a href="#c17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>— 本報特約記者　越浩生</p>
<p>千萬種彩色，也誌國府還都內禮盛況</p>
<p>千萬種彩色，也畫不盡這空前的欣喜；千萬種音響，也表現不完這漫天的歡笑。中華民國三十五年五月五日，是一個雙重喜慶的日子，是一個光耀歷史的佳節，整個的南京，都沐浴在狂歡裏，聲個的南京都捲沒在歇唱中。</p>
<p>五月四日濟晨，當我跳下從上海到南京的第一班火車，我爲這還都前夕各處熱烈準備的情形，激動得馬上捲入極度緊張心情中，沒有一刻喘息的機會，我一口氣跑上中宣部大樓，擠在從全國各地趕來的同業中，領取第二天觀禮的記者證，那淺紅與深紅的兩種符號，同是代表着歡喜的顏色，但大家都搶着要深紅的一種，因爲那是攝影記者用的，可以更走近典禮中心的地方，費了四個鐘頭的時閒，辦完了領蹬的手續，在被霓紅燈照　得一片紅暈的夜市中，我開始巡視還都大典前夕的南京。</p>
<p>馬路上流動着如潮的人羣，大家以同樣快暢的脚步，同樣歡喜的心情，度過這個夜晚，年靑人像在新婚的前夜，孩子們像在除夕的晚上，老年人爲這生命最大歡喜的即將到臨，心情更加激動。</p>
<p>第條大街一片紅彩</p>
<p>每條大街上，與馬路同樣長的大輻「歡迎國民政府還都」「歡迎蔣主席勝利歸來」積標語，已經高高掛起，國府路上兩座新建的巨型牌棧，在燈光照耀與夜影烘托中，更顯得光華偉麗，是完全立體型中西合璧式的建築，四個朱紅色的巨柱，支撑着描繪精緻的拱頂，在凱旋門式的兩邊立柱上下，一邊堅立着五面彩色鮮麗的國黨旗，門頂，紅底上嵌着四個巨大而厚重的金字「慶祝還都」，被燈光映照得金光閃耀，一片紅彩。</p>
<p>國儲像個新奇星座</p>
<p>佇立在國民政府門前仰望國府大門，從高刺長空的旗杆頭，到門頂兩側，繫着一長串的電燈，以夜空作背景，遠遠望去像一個新奇的星座，又像一個繁星綴成的長幔。拿着才領到的新聞記者證，我與門前的衛隊交涉，進去參觀國府內部的夜景。</p>
<p>走進國府大門，是一片水門汀的廣塲，一條筆直直的道路，直通到最後一座大樓，道路兩邊的花園西週，竪立着不可勝數的國黨旗，一片靑葱四圈沿着一道彩色的花邊，眞是一個美麗無比的畫面。</p>
<p>朱紅大柱矗立庭中</p>
<p>順着這一條路，直路走進去，第一段，是一個高敞的大庭，六排共卅個朱紅大柱矗立在庭中，再進去，裏面完全換成綠色的油漆，一條大理石色站着紅邊的地毯，從這裏直舖到主席辦公大樓的天井前，在燈光下望去，像一條長蜿，無限曲折，無限悠遠。由第三道門轉灣，可以走進禮堂，燭形的電憕，把禮堂照得雪亮，中央電影攝影廠的水銀燈，已經在那裏佈置妥當。回到原來的路上，再穿着一條天井，就是主席辦公大樓了。一個站立在廊前的衛隊，走上來詢問我，我再次的說明來意以後，他允許我上去，走廊上的燈光都已開亮着。</p>
<p>在主席辦公大樓上</p>
<p>我仔細的巡視每一個房間。二樓左邊的第一間是主席辦公室，玻璃門緊鎖，門鈕上還褂着一個寫着「二樓十三號」的木牌鑰匙號碼，隔壁第二間是主席會客室，斜對過的是文官長室。三樓的會議室，山字形的會議桌，咖啡色的皮靠椅，室内靜靜的，屋頂的電扇與蓮在形的吊燈，像在等待着主人的「開」「動」。會議室週圍是委員休息室。四樓是無綫電檔案室等。站立在頂層的陽台上鳥瞰整個國府，一片燈光，到樓頂，除了碰到守衛的衛隊，和趕着夜工佈置的工人外，各處都是靜靜的，週圍的蛙嗚可以很淸楚的聽到。夜風送來陣陣花園裏的幽香，我徘徊在主席辦公大棋上，皮鞋與地毯的摩擦，成了最大的聲響。從陽台上走下來，我再次的走到主席辦公室門前，一個人把那綠色的鐵紗門，開而又閉，我撫摸着那發光的銅扶手，有無限嚴肅感情，有無限崇敬的遐想。這一個發光的門鈕，正是與千萬心靈連繫的地方呵！</p>
<p>和平建國的司令台</p>
<p>在這還都大典的前夕，我獨自深夜來看望這象徵無限崇隆的國府。明天，這座大樓，即將開始為和平建國最高的司令台的工作，也即將成為全世界人士「心　往之」的地方。在門口我與警衛的人閒談，他是去年十二月返京，抗戰前，他就在警衛隊工作。當我問起第二天的還都大典時，他在嚴肅的立正中，仍然抑制不住那滿臉的歡喜。</p>
<p>朋友家中孩子故事</p>
<p>走出國民政府轉到了一個朋友家中，我更爲這家庭中洋溢着的歡欣氣氛感動。母親在爲孩子從衣箱中檢出那最花最漂亮的衣服，孩子在跳鬧着，無論如何不願意睡覺。他旋繞在老祖父膝前，不斷詢問着關於「明天」的故事。這個僅僅七歲在抗戰中生長，第一次回到南京的孩子，愛聽南京的故事。當老祖父開始對他講述從南京淪陷的事情時，他依在老祖父的膝前，瞪起大眼睛一聲不響的聽着，最後，老祖父把他抱在懷裏，吿訴他：「孩子！要永遠的記着，愛中國！愛南京！」老祖父的聲音有此顫抖，孩子感動的大眼睛裏，有淚光在閃。</p>
<p>我再走到大街上，各處已裝點得花團錦簇，一切的光色，都在爲「慶祝還都」四個字描繪，五月四日是一個沒有黑夜的一天，千萬人用緊張的工作和無限的興奮，迎接來了黎明。</p>
<p>重慶行營代理主任張羣，本月二日就職，軍令部長徐永昌代表　蔣委員長授印情形。</p>
<p>瀋陽市民舉行國軍進駐大會為東北淪陷十四年來未有之盛舉。圖為會後遊行情景，右上角為東北行營主任熊式輝將軍。</p>
<h3 id="c18">莊嚴的聖地·莊嚴的大典　由太陽自己來揭幕 <a href="#c18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>今天，這千萬人的呼呼，洗盡了八年來蒙受的恥辱！</p>
<p>通日陰雨後，五日淸晨的太陽，像爲這個空前的盛典而特別出現的有太陽的天氣，黎明來得雖早，大街上混身滿貼着標語的大小汽車已經開始在穿梭奔走，各種各樣的車輛同向着中山門，向着太陽出來的方向急馳。</p>
<p>在光華門外濃蔭夾道的柏油路上，遙望中山陵，一縷淸晨霭靈的薄霧，籠罩在陵園上太陽，越來越高，薄霧越趨越淡，這莊嚴的聖地，莊嚴的大典，是要太陽自己來揭幕的。</p>
<p>到雪白光彩的陵園</p>
<p>到了，到了，那朝陽中顯得無限靑翠，巍巍然放着雪白光彩的陵園到了，在大門前的廣塲上下了汽車，仰望紫金山，陵園的台階像一列可以直登靑天的高梯，兩側的高桿上，國黨旗迎着朝陽，迎着晨風在飄揚。邁着莊嚴中含有無限愉快的步子，循級而上，每個人險上都是滿浮歡笑，彼此雖不認識，大家也是用歡笑在互打着招呼。</p>
<p>文武百官先後齊集</p>
<p>靈堂前的廣塲上，集中着文武官員參政員和國大代表們，大家在握手招呼，互問着：「甚麽時候到南京來的？」武官在左，全穿着新式的陸軍軍服，將星閃閃，文官在右，西裝和長袍馬褂，式樣不一。文官的一面，中央執監委員在前，參政員與國大代表在後，常務委員帶有特別的紅條，可以在靈堂中，新聞記者們排列在祭堂門外兩側。</p>
<p>孫院長和他的大公子被攝影記者們請到國父的坐像前集中拍照，宋院長穿着藍的中山服，和大家不斷握手，何應欽和陳誠從左邊定來，全體　　　　。當吳鐵老再從禮堂中走出迎接時，大家知道主席即將到來。一片掌聲響了，　主席與夫人從中央的交通路上走上來。</p>
<p>主席掛五枚大勳章</p>
<p>主席穿着新式的嗶嘰陸軍服，胸前配着五枚大勳章。夫人着墨呢大衣，和深藍底紫色喇叭花的旗袍，左襟上配着動章，左襟上配着航委會證章，夫人在左，主席在右，走進靈堂。</p>
<p>典禮開始，禮砲聲奏着震天的拍子，　式在禮砲中進行，奏樂，獻花。張道藩朗讀祭文，飛機在低空上散着傳單。靈堂內，光在閃儀式完舉，主席領導着全體繞進謁靈，一刻鐘後，邁着沉重的步子，走出靈堂，站立在階前的陽光下演講。講詞用大字寫在一叠便條紙上，簡短有力。常被熱烈的掌聲打斷。致詞完畢後，典禮結束。主席與夫人循着台階下去，羣衆在兩勞　擁着走。鼓掌聲和高　『主席萬歲！』的聲音，此起彼落，連續不斷。一段的手杖，環顧左右，在陽光下，面孔上閃着健康的紅色，　主席的健康，是全中國人的歡喜！</p>
<p>國父有知也在歡笑</p>
<p>兩邊的童子軍在跳躍歡呼，夫人揮動着四色的手巾向孩子們答禮。中外攝影記者趕在前面，爬得高高的，來攝取這珍貴的鏡頭。走出陵園了！　主席在上汽車前，立在車門前，向山頂致敬，向羣衆還禮。隨着汽車掀起的一縷輕塵，歡呼聲在作震天的轟響。今天，這千萬人的歡呼，是洗盡了陵園八年來蒙受的恥辱。長眠在紫金山頭的　國父有知，也會衷心歡笑的。城內大街上，擁着如潮的人羣，向着　主席的汽車歡呼。南京，被漫天的歡唱淹沒了！</p>
<h3 id="c19">在慶祝大會 <a href="#c19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>— 本報駐京記者　張明</p>
<p>與會每個中華子孫都感到奮慰：國民政府現今又遷回到了南京！</p>
<p>從陵墓出來，人的行列，車的行列，行進着。人們的情緒是激動的。聰那無邊的海似的聲浪在泛濫着。他們都爭取一個機會，就是能站在　主席和夫人的附近，乃至於向前走近一步都好，因爲這是一種光榮。</p>
<p>這一條人和車的潮流，在長長的兩邊整齊地栽着楊槐的寬敞的栢油路上湧過去。特別晴朗的陽光，照射着一切。人們的心，都向着光明！</p>
<p>許多富麗堂皇的慶祝牌坊，在各個衝要處竪立着。那增加東方色調的硃紅，描繪在高聋的樑柱上，使我們在熱烈之中，更添了不少景仰。等到牌坊落在後頭，我們到達目的地了——國民大會大廣塲。這兒將開始一個熱烈民衆大會，人們是自由地參加着。有機關代表，有市民個人，也有政府官長。</p>
<p>會塲的佈置很簡單，主席台在會塲的一端高峙着。這兒不許閒人上去，台上佈置了一些美的鮮鑿的盆花。同時，屛峙在中央的一巨幅旗幟是南京全體市民獻給主席的。上面是這麽四個大字：「勳彪京關」。金色的字，貼在紅底上面。</p>
<p>因為人羣在不斷地從入口處，湧了進來，於是指揮者不得不聲嘶力竭請大家注意秩序。大隊記者不曾被規入那一個部門，因此他們不斷的接受着擴音器裏送出來的命令。比方：「退到右邊」或「再退一步」，可是，記者們終究是在人的波浪裏守望，一直等到　主席蒞臨。</p>
<p>那是十時廿五分，歡呼的聲浪像炸裂了這個空間，主席走到台邊，人們還帶着更熱烈的希望歡呼着。於是，夫人也前進了一步，在台邊立定。就這麼，持續着一個聲浪的海。我親眼看着一個小女孩子，她在很艱困的情形下，擠到記者羣裏，呼着：「蔣主席萬歲！」接着，那一種很愉快樊貼的歡笑，就發射在她的臉上。自然，她會感到這麽接近主席一步，會使主席能親耳聽到她的聲浪，她是一個國民，她有這種希望，也得到應有的滿足。</p>
<p>歡呼聲裏，大會秩序開始了；但是直到　主席訓話開始，還是不斷的聽問着四周途到的「主席萬歲」……</p>
<p>主席的訓話很簡潔，很切實，也很打動人的感情。人們深深地覺得　主席今天是和我們站在一起，而且是這麽一直親親切切地記墨着這紫金山麓的人們的。主席曾經這麽追溯他廿六年離開南京的情形，那些黯然的回憶，更促成了今日還都的興奮與熱烈。同時，　主席這麼說：「今天仍然在南京，再見到我們全體同胞，而且我們得到了勝利，我們不平等的條約已取消，這都是全國同胞奮鬥的結果。心裏實在感奮。」把功勞全部放在同胞的身上，人們更以感激的心情聽下去。</p>
<p>「今天以後，我們要免除人家的屠殺，人家的侮辱，我們一定要自立自張，全體同胞要團結奮鬥，和衷共濟，以增加國家的力量，國家的地位。」這是一個提示，同時　主席以革除浪費，尙勤儉，守紀律，負責任，勉全體同胞。最後，祝大家的健康。這一興奮逾恒的塲面，就在這裏吿了一個段落。人們又瘋狂地呌吼起來。會塲的秩序，幾乎動盪起來，但是沒有混亂。今日晴空萬里，紫金山在金碧的色調下，輝煌地存在着。到處飄盪着靑天白日滿地紅的旗幟，每一個中華民族的子孫，都該是驕傲：國民政府又回到了南京！</p>

<p>— 本報駐京記者　毛樹奎</p>
<p>主席夫婦</p>
<p>蔣主席汽車抵陵園後，籌備會已備好藤轎二頂，主席夫婦拒絕趁坐，仍徒步走上靈堂，僅走十五分二十秒。　主席步履穩健，不氣喘，不臉紅，衆咸以　主席之健康爲喜。</p>
<p>蔣主席演講及行禮時，蔣夫人總退後一步，而上下汽車登石級時，則夫人在前，　主席在後。</p>
<p>主席演講稿，共九張，字跡特別大，蓋恐看不淸楚。　主席講畢，即交兪濟時收藏。</p>
<p>蔣夫人今日身着黑色大衣，黑地紫花高領長呢旗袍。黑色空趾高跟鞋，黑色耳環、全付素色，更顯莊嚴姿態。</p>
<p>會塲種種</p>
<p>還都大典籌備會昨夜通宵辦公，尤其是交通組發臨時通行證，最爲忙碌。</p>
<p>大會出席證，種類繁多。形式有長條子的，有扁方的，顏色有淡紅的，有深紅的，參加時「无哈希奇」，進靈塲，却大有分別。</p>
<p>維持陵園秩序之童子軍中，最年幼者名祁亞雄，僅九歲。人雖小，精神甚好。</p>
<p>總理祭堂前文武官員，分列左右，文官一邊，包括中央委員·參政員·國大代表·及各院各部簡任以上文官二千餘人。第一排第一人為女中委張默君；武官一邊包括海陸空軍諸將領一千餘人，辰小級階爲少校，第一排第一人爲黃其翔上將，第二人爲唐式遵上將。</p>
<p>中將司儀着芹這麽報吿：「中央委員站第一排，乃至幾十徘。」</p>
<p>凡屬武官，今天一律把勳章掛出，大有勳章展覽，勳章競賽之概。</p>
<p>上午兩會，在陵園的會中，特點是鼓掌多，在大廣塲的，是歡呼多。一個用手，一個用嘴，相對成趣。</p>
<p>人物之相</p>
<p>何總司令應欽，全身滿綴大勳章，共達十二枚之多，成爲攝影者好對象。</p>
<p>谷正綱谷正鼎兩昆仲，上陵園石階後，遇見劉文島，三人邊走邊談，皆以陵園未遭毁壞爲喜。走至另一處，谷正綱突停步，笑吿乃弟曰：「這裏的一個鼎，沒有了。」</p>
<p>邵力子今穿一全新派力司中山裝，與邵夫人携手同行，不稍分離，狀至親密。</p>
<p>女中委當中，以沈慧述爲最胖，唐國柏最高。沈抵陵墓時，顯上包着一塊很素淡美觀的紗巾。但是她說：「我並不是爲了美麗。」</p>
<p>滬商會會長王曉續於民衆慶祝大會散會時，被門口憲兵所阻，而後面人羣仍如潮湧，王會長前後受敵，大喊「讓開」「讓開」。幸有一少將級軍官經過，始得解閱。</p>
<p>大典以前，記者羣分別向新聞人物獲取資料，其中以吳國楨被包圍的時間頂長。吳氏今日身著長袍馬掛，但是今天滿面開花的笑着，因此雖莊嚴，却和藹。</p>
<p>汽車展覽</p>
<p>停放在陵墓一旁之汽車；多至千補，有最老的，也有最新的，有如長蛇。可謂集南京汽車之大成，洋洋大觀。</p>
<p>今晨破曉即有汽車行駛於陵圖大道上，據陵國守衛吿記者稱：最早一輛汽車到達陵園者，爲某報館之記者車，時間爲五時四十分。</p>
<p>中外記者</p>
<p>參加還都大典之記者共一百六十餘人，包括全國各地之報社，其中有六十高齡之河南靑白報老記者，白髯飄飄，頗受同行注目。</p>
<p>大典將要開始，外國記者隊蜂擁而至，聲勢赫赫，站在軍警後面的中國記者，也馬上提起精神，不甘落後，預備隨隊而進，但結果：「也被擋駕」。</p>
<p>爲了大典，中外各地記者齊集首都，有上海趕夜車來的，也有從重慶天上飛來的。眞所謂「冠蓋雲集」，「人山人海」。</p>
<p>陵園還都大典，除八位美聯社等記者參加採訪攝影外，餘無外國人。</p>

<p>海棠花開遍華盛頓  本報四月廿日航訊　駐美特派員毛樹淸寄　　陽曆四月初旬天氣，紐約街頭還刮着颼颼冷風，但是，在華盛頓，已經洋溢着無限春意。　　海棠花開遍了華盛頓，從帕都滿河岸到落磯公國，一路上，盡是各色各樣的海棠花。憲治路上，綠楊垂柳，點綴着美的首都。　　我沒有趕上最著名的櫻花的季節，當我到達的那天，林肯紀念堂台階四週的櫻花，已經凋謝了。『就祗有那麼三四天艷麗的日子，一忽兒就凋謝完了』。朋友們安慰着我：『沒關係的，到華盛頓來，你有看不盡的花草，聽不盡的故事』！　　那一天，正是羅斯福逝世一週年的紀念日，杜魯門總統，早一天下午，在白宮舉行了記者招待會，他所說的，和第二天在海德公園發表的公開演講相仿。紐的和華盛頓的報紙，都刋載了他在羅斯福墓上獻花沉思的照片。『美國歷史上的一代完人，如今長眠在地下了，後繼的人，將如何來貫澈羅斯福的遣志』？這問題現在普遍在全美國，無論那一種立塲，那一種黨派的報紙，現在都呌出同樣的呼聲來。　　有人說：美國人對羅斯福，有一種瘋狂的，幾乎是偶像式的崇拜。這在過去的美國歷史上，可以說是沒有先例的。紐的日報紀念羅斯福的專輯上說：『從前我們敬仰華盛頓國父，景仰林肯總統，祗不過紀念他每年的生日而已。現在我們紀念羅斯福總統，不僅耙念生日，並且還紀念忌辰……像這樣史無先例的紀念，正如同羅斯福連任四次的史無先例一樣』。我和好幾位紐約的美國同業談起過，他們的共同意見是：羅斯福一手造成了美國在世界中的領導地位，所以美國老百姓崇拜他。戰後的局面，美國似乎在遂漸喪失國際間的領導作用了，美國人懷念過去，因　之，更景仰着他了……」。如今被且爲相常左傾的紐約『下午報』，那天出版了一份非常生動的紀念專刋。裏封面有一幅漫畫。史達林委員長橫跨着半個地球，雙手揷腰，挺胸凸肚。旁邊一大羣弱者躲在山姆叔叔的後面，山姆叔叔臀下藏着三顆原子炸彈。漫畫的右上角，畫着羅斯福，他在雲霧的天堂，俯望着人間。旁邊寫着：這豈是他理想的世界。我認爲這幅畫可以代表美國人相當大多數人的意見。　　美國當仁不讓領導世界和平　　無論在白宮的週圍，在紐約，在芝加哥，乃至於遼遠的阿拉斯加，只要是美國人，都不會差得很遠。美國人決不會再成爲『孤立主義』者，美國人今天認爲他們所應該做的，是當仁不讓的領導和平世界的責任。　　領導責任，並不就是從事戰爭，相反的，大部份的美國年靑人，都不願再見第三次的世界大戰了。他們認爲：國際的紛爭，可以用外交步驟來解決。「羅斯福已經替金元王國，奠立了國際外交的領導地位，爲什麼後繼的人，不能　規曹隨呢？於是，若干美國人，對杜魯門總統的政見與能力，發生了懷疑。更激烈的輿論，甚至痛擊貝爾納斯。　　「下午報」曾經替民主黨的先後兩位白宮主人，作過比較。它說，羅斯福的眼光，手腕，儀態，言談，以及他的正直，都足以祖當一個大國的行政首領。杜魯門總統，是一個勤懇苦幹，做事情從不媽虎的人，但是，他缺乏一種磅礴的氣概，而這種氣槪，正是「國際社會間發生領導作用的最重要因素」。　　民主黨兩健將發動政治競賽　　英雄開創了不平凡的時勢，時勢也能够決定英雄的成敗。第一次世界大戰的結果，把一位神聖的大理想家，弄得失意，　　，終至嘔血而死。至今美國人講起　爾遜總統，仍然搖頭。今天杜魯門總統，正是唱的後半節威爾遜的戲。這種內在的底蘊和苦衷，決不是我們白宮圈子以外的人所能了解的。羅斯福逝世週年那大，紐約世界電訊報的首都記者　得，安迪遜，寫了一段短文，呌做「杜魯門與華萊士」，他說兩位民主黨的大將，羅斯福從前的密友，現在正開始着政治的競賽。等到一九四八年大選的時候，杜魯門將屆六十四歲，華萊士正好六十。到再下一屆一九五二年的選舉的時候，華萊士也將成爲六十四歲了。安迪遜的結語下得很奧妙：無論如何，六十四歲當總統，　嫌太老了一些　　　　　　　　過　　，　　　到過中國的商務部長華萊士先生，現在成爲慢慢被人注意的人物。羅斯福逝世週年紀念，華萊士在哥洛摩飯店公開講演，聽衆逾二千人。羅斯福夫人，勞工部長施倫伯，都在那裏，郵政總長哈理曼，派了代表到塲。那天，華萊士的演講激昂慷慨，他認爲美國不應該與英國並肩，與蘇聯爲敵。他說羅斯福總統當年培育的美國領導地位，眼見着就要毁滅，新的第三次的世界危機，正在醞釀。因之，他主張美國的外交準則，應該站在英國與蘇聯之間，既不偏袒英國的帝國主義，也不偏袒蘇俄的共產主義，『惟有這樣，世界才有和平』。許多報紙，都用大字刋載華萊士的演講，但沒看到具體的批評。　　紐約時報爲杜魯門總統進入第二年的施政，作種種內幕的推測，可能，政府會在短期間內局部改組。勞工部長和另外幾部，很有『下台』的可能。在一九四八年以前，以貝爾納斯爲中心的外交準則，不會有多大變動。　　黨務中心工作集中郵長身上　　國會的一部份人士，正在醞釀，抨擊郵正總長哈理曼，紐約每日鏡報的華府通訊寫著：縱然國會用多大力量攻擊他，他是不會倒的，只要他自己願意幹多久，他便能幹多久！根據美國的黨政慣例，大凡當郵政總長的多是執政黨的秘書長或總幹事。他是黨務的中心人物。美國每一次總統改選，如果總統的位置，由甲黨移轉到乙黨，郵政總長的位置，也必定由甲黨移轉到乙黨。不但如此，全國各地的郵政局長也常常隨之變換。一般說，美國的民主黨或共和黨，黨務內部，也是講究組織　，各州各縣各鄉鎮的郵政局長，有不少是黨務的負責人。彼此都聲氣相通，特別是競選全國性的或各州的議員，黨務人員有聯絡通訊的責任。我在華盛頓參觀國會的時候，曾經詳細和一位國會秘書處的職員談過，他說：郵政的工作，比較最機械，也最單純，郵政負責人員的更　，並不如其它各行政部門的更換，不會影響到行政的效率。　　然而，大多數對黨務最出力的人，並不願意當郵政局長，很多都是工商界中有地位的人，郵政的薪水縱然高，遠不及工商業的豐裕舒服。這些人都是對政見有興趣，而並不對行政有興趣，因此，他們不願意做官。他說：許多美國的資本家，或在實業界上有成就的人，也偶而參加美國政府，那是跟「票友」演戲一樣，表　一下才能而已，稍爾遜之出任戰時生產局，便是一個例子。『這些情形，和你們中國，和蘇聯的所謂政黨完全兩樣！』他微笑着結束了他的說明。　　歐爾利走紅運已成百萬富翁　　相反的情形，在美國也是有的，那便是當了官以後，再當工商界，幾年以前，全世界報紙上常常出現的白宮秘書歐爾利，現在當了美國一家規模極大的臥車公司的董事長，有位華盛頓的美國同業吿訴我：歐爾利出身是一個不知名的新聞記者，不知什麼人替他介紹給了羅斯福總統，羅斯福愛他聰明機敏，口齒伶俐，才交給他擔任總統私人起居的發言人，歐爾利幹了將近十年，憑白宮的關係，認識了不少美國各方面的人。羅斯福逝世以後，他卸了官，臥車公司爲也認識的人多，結交廣，爲便於推銷生意，請他擔任了費事長，『這小子算是走了紅運，現在是百萬富翁了』。那位同業很有些感　。也有些像羨慕。　　資本主議的社會，工商業是第一，我在參衆兩院，聽了三小時的討論，衆議院一大半時間，都是爲徵稅問題，許多許多數目字，時期，稅率，比例，百分比，嘮嘮叨叨一大篇。那天，四百多議席，祗到了五十多個人，議員們都具有充份的自由，有的看報，有的聯天，有的把大腿擱在前排椅背上，閉著兩眼養神，有的穿梭一般來來往往。議長坐在『太師椅』上，跟一位朋友聊天，議長的朋友，匐伏在議長台上，令人毫無絲毫莊嚴的感覺，祗有有關係的幾個議員，在彼此雄辯滔滔。參議院的情形，比較端重，九十六張紅漆的坐椅及桌子，都有固完的席次，（衆院自由入座），那天，到了二十三人。我聽他們討論有關菲律濱的案件，威斯康辛州的議員羅伯特，大聲疾呼：『美國要重視遠東』！　　太平洋上各島傳將續建工事　　原子能的管制權問題，現在是美國國會一個極重要的討論的題材。麥克麥閎法案，主張由政府及人民合組委員會管制，超脫於軍部以外，已經獲得了上院專門委員會的通過。但是，美國朝野，有不少輿論，主張交給軍部控制。四月七日美國陸　軍節那天，杜魯門總統在芝加哥的有力講演長，都有專文在全美各報發表。美國為保持和平，應該備有舉世無匹的戰鬥力。艾森豪威爾元帥，要美國健兒們珍視過去的光榮，永遠保持光榮的戰績。聽說：一度改變為平時工業的重轟炸機廠現在又停止了平時工業的製造。聽說，龐大的造艦工作，現在又步入了更新的階段。的傳說，像不同的海棠花的顏色一樣，開遍在華盛頓的每一個角落。重慶月夜  本報三日航訊　特約記者趙浩生　　十七日淸晨，坐着報館的吉普車趕往白市驛機塲，想起三天以前交通部的還都人員，因爲趕淸晨五點鐘起飛，深夜乘車到白市驟，結果半路翻率，許多人受傷的事。我們特別關照司機把速度放慢點，慢慢的是，可以更淸楚的看一看淸晨的山卻，同時也可以更多的呼吸一些這獨山中使人依　的空氣。　　在依別的心情中，許多平時常見到的事情，今天都變得特別引起人注意了，當我們的汽車繞着一個大山盤旋而上時，一部滑竿在循着小路走，滑竿總是趕到我們的前而，滑竿與吉普賽跑，結果，我們的吉普竟失敗了。滑竿，是極能代表四川風味的一種交通工具。那天，牠在我們的記憶中，是加上了一段更生動的印象。　　車子到達機塲時，中央黨部的專機已經起飛了，「小渝」現在正在空中向重慶吿別。九點鐘左右，航空公司及幾家報館的東子都開到了，周圍馬上熱鬧起來。中航公司上飛機的地方沒有休息室，社會部招待處的木板房尙未落成，僅僅有汽汕補圈起來的一塊空地，大家把毯子攤在草地上坐下，開頭是以晒晒太陽的心情坐着，慢慢的起飛時間，仍然茫無消息，當頂的太陽越來越利害，每個人都呌起苦來，從淸晨八點鐘等到十二點，依然不得結果，機塲中的工人臨時在那裏賣茶和點心，解決了飢渴問題。直到下午兩點鐘，才見到一架中航機降落，結果，是中央社優先起飛，把等待了半天的赴台人員擠下，他們只好到白市驛找旅館過夜。四時許，又來了一架，是立法院的專機，但因爲時間已晚，不能起飛，只能把行李遝上去，許多斯文老邁的立法委員們，也只好在飛機上過夜了。我們的命運已經注定，絕沒有走的希望，大家在考慮是否再回城裏去，因為想到第二天再趕來的交通工具問題，多數的人都決定不走，把今晚的時間打發在雞毛小店中，軍子把我們送到機塲附近社會部的復員招待所。出乎意外，那裏有很好的房間，很乾凈的床褥設備，是最近專為空運復員的新設建，還有許多房間尙未落成。如此，可以避免以後深夜趕來上飛機，再造成翻車的怪劇了。　　整日毫無結果的焦待和曝晒，最後，找到了這麽一個，「安身立命」的所在，大家都非當滿意。當晚正是陰曆十六，有好月亮，我們道一羣生命力時感過剩的年靑人，利用這難得的空閒，難得的月夜，要來解放一下。自從「民主以來」，重慶的新聞記者們，大家都是忙得團團轉，整日的開會，發電，寫稿，連吃飯睡覺的時間，都被剝奪了不少。幾個月來，心情從未輕鬆過，想又到在這趕赴國民大會之前，有了這一晚天賜的空閒。我們不需要睡覺，我們要玩，好好玩一夜，這是在重慶生活的最後一頁，應常把它寫得輕鬆點，有趣點。　　一頓飽飯過後，我們坐在田地上的露大茶館裏，在吐着半天朱殷的晚霞中送日落，在蒼茫的夜色裏迎月出。同行的一位沉默的小姐，在靜靜的吐着烟圈，把她的思想潛進了那被晚風吹散了的靑烟裏，作海闊天空的飛翔。一位愛唱的小姐在不斷的啍着：　　「太陽下山，明天還要爬起來，我的靑春，小鳥一去不回來」。　　是一片靜悠悠的空氣，一片閒蕩蕩的心情。　　當月亮爬上東邊的山頭時，我們挾着毛毯，順着公路，向着月出的方向走去。一路上，誰也不願意大聲的說一句話，來擾亂這甜蜜的安靜，誰也不願意把脚步放得太重、生怕踏碎了那如水的月光。有人提議每個人講一段有關月夜的記憶。有人說，他從今晚起，才眞正有了一個値得紀念的有關月夜的記憶了。　　在一個離開公路走往水田的草地上，大家坐了下來。春夜的露珠，使草地更溫軟，大家靜靜的傾聽着水田裏的蛙鳴，在月光中，凝望着遠處山頭上夜行人忽隱忽現的燈火。除了蛙鳴外，周遭沒有地點聲息。在靜寗中可以聽到自己和別人呼吸的聲音，在靜寗中，眞正的感到了生命的有在　　大家都不知道時間，大家都不願意看錶。但遠處的更聲和逐漸襲來的寒氣，已吿訴我們夜已很深，應該回去了。　　歸途上，大家互爲今晚的安睡和明日順利的起飛祝福。當天的沒有走成，却變爲並不使人埋怨的事情了。　　招待所一夜甜睡。第二天離開時，他們並不要錢，服務生連小費也不收，侮人只在登記表上簽一個字，這眞是澈底的服務機關，使大家很感到過意不去。新港督與新港鈔  本報航訊　特約記者林友蘭寄　　據香港軍政府發言人於發表英殖民地部的公報：「楊慕琦爵士Sir　Mark　young將於四月底遄返香港，復任香港總督兼海陸空軍總司令職。楊爵士抵埠之日，軍政當局即將政府移交楊爵上，英皇經敕准延長楊爵士任香港總督兼海陸軍總司令之任期，由渠復職之日起，爲期一年。」　　這無疑是渴望恢復民政的香港人士的一個喜訊。民政的恢復，在下月必可實現，　　老爵士　取華人名字　　楊慕琦是怎樣的一個人物呢？一九四一年九月十日，他首次抵港履新。不及五月，太平洋戰事便爆發了。　　照他的名字，一般譯作「楊格」，但香港專替洋大人　譯名字的「司爺」，硬要給他想出一個有聲有色的中國名字，好像惟有這樣譯法才可取得當地華僑的信心。楊爵士雅愛體育，是一個草地網球的能手，畢業於劍橋大學，現年六十歲。他的父親是一個派駐印度的英國將官，楊慕琦經過殖民地文官考試及格後，首被派往錫蘭服務。　　服務久　經驗極豐富　　上次大戰時，投軍入伍。戰後，仍返錫蘭。一九三零年，調任巴勒斯坦轉政司，巴勒斯坦是回敎徒和猶太人常常發生衝突的地方，最不容易統治。據說英國的殖民地官史，如欲升充大位，似乎每個都要經過這個試騐，假如他在巴勒斯坦應付有方，獲得榮銜，便被看作一個優秀人才，以後在殖民地的政海上，總可一帆風順，出人頭地。楊氏未任港督之前，曾任巴都總督，坦干伊喀總督，政績車著，對統治殖民地已有豐富的經騐。　　新任命　發生太波動　　戰前，楊慕　統治香港，祇有短短的一百天。香港人民對他的印象，似乎並不壞。　　他的任命發表後的驚人第一砲，就是港府於二日宣佈一律通用日軍佔領香港後港滬兩地匯豐銀行被迫發行的「迫簽紙幣」。驀地裏，霹靂一聲，當即引起重大的反響。金融市塲發生相當的波動，物價跟着浮昇。這個消息事前總算保持若干程度的秘密。半月前，市面開始盛傳「迫簽紙幣」在金融界中簡稱「新大」將有恢復行使的可能，牠的價値便由二成至二成五，驟升至五成左右，直至消息米有正式公佈的前刻，牠的價値還未超過五成。　　二日下午一時，香港政府新聞處召集記者發表這個重大的消息，因爲已趕不上晚報截稿的時間，所以，各報遲至三日的早晨，才正式刋出，但消息既到得新聞記者之手，當日下午二時，便已傳遍市面，人們相率驚吿：「發財機會錯過了！」好像自嗟爲什麼不够聰明：事前買進十萬八萬，而今豈不已够享用半生？　　滙豐行　收迫簽紙幣　　「迫簽紙幣」的數額，聽說總計在一萬萬以上。留落在澳門者比香港爲多，而留落在上海的數目，則比澳門更大。據說銀行當局在過去半年間，派人秘密在上海收購，已收回數千萬元。另有不可知之數，曾由日軍起運離港，其所附載的船隻，中途被盟國潛艇擊沉，鈔票亦隨之沉沒海底。現在尙流市面的數額，實際至多不過數千萬元，也許不致引起通貨膨脹的惡果。滙豐銀行自二日下午起，開始接收「迫簽紙幣」，價値和面額相等，整個下午的收入，共達四十餘萬元。　　投機商　收兌日軍票　　迫簽紙幣恢復行使後，法幣由二三六，漲至二六一。黃金由三九零，漲至四二三。有人說：港府故意使港幣跌値，因爲港幣的價値太過高漲，終非香港市塲之福。假如說廣州的生活程度已居全國的首位，那麽，香港的生活程度，便居中國首位的首位了！廣州內地的人民，還有誰願意到香港去作賠本的生意？　　由於「迫簽紙幣」的行使，現在已有投機分子，進行收兌日人在香港發行的軍票，每萬元出價七元。軍票是根據菲律賓會議的決定作廢的。我外交部接受港中僑商的請求，早經和英政府交涉復用，已獲　未能更改國際上的決定」爲答。　　新港督委出後，香港僑胞對他的期待實在至大至殷，相信他也能大展良猷，不致辜負他們的熱望吧？　（三日）圖片說明：享受着悠閒生活的美國農民之姿態。皖境長江兩岸五萬農民　趕築穀倉圍牆  本報五月一日蕪湖訊　林澍　　安徽善後救濟分署，目前集中精力在皖境修築有名的「穀倉　牆」。這圍牆，在皖境長江南北兩岸，是防止江水高漲時倒灌稻田的江堤。今年二月二十日，首先由江北岸無爲縣與和縣的無和大堤着手動工，迄今四十天，每天有五萬農夫農婦參與工作，已完成百分之五十，預定五月二十日在白茆灣工地，舉行無和段江堤落成禮。　　在修築無和段江堤的現在，一個修築全部皖境長江南北岸江堤計劃，亦在實施中。已動員皖境南北岸懷寗，東流，　江，桐城，銅陵，靑陽，繁昌，蕪湖等八縣農民十萬人，來參加工作。全部工程，約八百萬土公方。爲了避免妨害農作，預定在六月底全部完成竣工。這計劃的實施，依賴了救濟麵粉，農夫們每做究一個土公方。可得二十市斤麵粉。無和段江堤目下修築完工部份，據柯副署長育甫云：「堤基一百三十尺，堤面二十四尺。堤高比民國二十年水位（長江近百年水位最高的一年）近高出一公尺。安黴分署除了發給麵粉推動民工外，近派出醫療隊常駐工地，担任民工保健醫藥工作」。　　在糧荒以及米價高漲聲中，皖省穀倉是一個被重視的希望泉源。安徽救濟分署的蜀長葉元龍與副蜀長柯育甫雖然是二個書生，却因是農家子弟的家世，而能掌握到恢復並擴大糧食再生產這一工作重點。他們二人也都當川到堤工地段去實地參與工作，更可見其關壞穀倉圍牆的熱烈心腸。　　在產麥區的皖北，淮堤修築工程已在懷遠境內動工。淮堤的有六百萬土公方工程，工程技術則由導淮委員會負責指導，皖救濟分署亦以麵粉發給參與堤工的十萬淮上健兒，醫療隊亦在派出中，預定六月底全部完成。　　除了糧食生產間接工作之外，皖分署還分到行總的德字美棉種三十噸。但棉種下地的日子再遲十來天，即種不下去了，一個多月前，行總滬處即會表示運蕪，但迄今尙未運出，倘若在最近運至京蕪，柯副蜀長方尙可及時分發安慶及烏江棉作區供用，而不致躭誤下種。　　今年有夏是救濟工作的最重要關頭，因爲若果在下種生產季節做不出事來，秋收就成了大問題。如果秋收成了大問題，從今冬至明年秋收這一年期中，全國的糧荒及由比而生的問題就更大。記者在由皖來滬的途中雖因江北原野火厮殺的消息而憂愁，可是限看到江南田野中，麥秀菜花香，又覺得稍獲了一種安慰。圖片說明　上：無和大堤白茆灣生工　　下：葉元龍署長柯育甫副署長在工地督導全國食糧嚴重恐慌中　看江蘇麺粉工業  本報廿七晶鎭江通訊　特約記者和香林寄　　江蘇的民營工業除了紡織工業以外，要算麵粉工業了。麵粉工業，固然是江蘇省的一大工業，就是在全國，也佔有相當的地位。　　可是，正因爲牠是江蘇省的民營工業的一大部門，在八年的戰爭中，受盡了敵偽的摧殘和統制，倖免的祇有常州奔牛的裕豐麵粉廠，其餘的不是被敵僞强迫收買，就是被敵偽無條件的强佔，可憐嫩芽似的民族工業，竟變成爲敵偽剝削同胞的工具，這是件多麼使人痛心的事；「八一五」後，敵偽勢力既銷聲匿跡，這個民族工業的功苗，也就跟着獲致照蘇的機會了。第一步是由江蘇省田賦糧食管理處，會同江蘇省政府從敵偽手中接收過來，第二步是加以整頓，圖謀復工。一直到現在這些工廠，有的一天都沒有停工，有的已經復工，有的正在籌劃復工，不過因了燃料的缺乏，動力的不足，出粉的數量，在短期以內，恐怕不能到達預期的襟準。　　江蘇的麵粉廠，大多數集中在京滬沿綫各地，尤其是無錫，竟達二十餘家之多，其餘的是散佈在鎭江·揚州·溧陽·高郵·泰州·徐州·海州等縣城，現在且將各廠情形調査於後：　　（甲）已接收者　　（一）蘇州：新豐（民營被統制）馬達座數七，鋼磨部數七，職工人數一二二，侮日生產能力一三〇林袋，已復工。大華（民營被統制）馬達座數十三，鋼磨部數六，職工人數九十二，侮日生產能力八〇〇袋，現正籌劃復工，太和（民營被統制）馬達座數三，鋼磨部數十一，籌劃復工中。三豐（敵營）馬達座數一，鋼磨郃數八，職工人數四十八，現已收歸官辦復工改名蘇州麵粉廠。　　（二）無錫：永安二廠（民營被統制）馬達座數九鋼磨部數十一，職工人數三十三，每日生產能力一三〇〇袋，已開工。振華（民營被統制）馬達座數三，鋼磨部數七，職工人數六十二，每日主產能力二〇〇〇袋，正壽劃復工。廣豐（民營被統制）馬達庫數十一，鋼磨部數十一，職工人數一百二十五，每日生產能力二〇〇〇袋，已開工。民豐，（民營被統制）馬達座數三，鋼磨部數四，職工人數六十三，現正籌劃復工。華新（民營被統制）馬達座數四，鋼磨部數十八，職工人數一百十六，每日生產能力二四〇〇袋，已開工。泰豐（民營被統制）馬達座數三，鋼磨部數四，聯工人數五十五人，每日生產能力一〇〇〇袋，已開工。增豐（民營被統制）馬達座數三，鋼磨部數七，職工人數九十六，每日生產能力二〇〇〇袋，已開工。華友大豐（敵人強佔民營）鋼磨部數三十五，機件毁壞暫難復工。茂新（敵人强佔民營）鋼磨部數二十五，原業主接管復工。華友久成（敵人强佔民營）機件散失。順豐（民營被統制）馬達座數二。鋼磨部數五，職工人數七十一，每日生產能力一五〇〇袋，已復工。九福（民營被統制）馬達座數三，鋼磨部數八，職工人數六十五，每日生產能力一八〇〇袋，正淸理中。永安一廠（民營被統制）馬達座數二，鋼磨部數三，職工人數二十，每日生產能力二五袋，已開工。茂豐（民營被統制）馬達座數三，鋼磨部數四，職工人數三十，每日生產能力四〇〇袋，已開工。新豐盛（民營被統制）馬達座數一，鋼磨部數一，職工人數三十人，每日生產能力一〇〇袋，已開工。惠豐（民營被統制）馬達座數三，鋼磨部數二，職工人數三十六，每日生產能力一〇〇袋，已開工。和新（民營被統制）停工。聚豐盛（民營被統制）馬達座數二，鋼磨部數二，職工人數二十八，每日生產能力三〇〇袋，已開工，順豐新（民營被統制）馬達座數二，鋼磨部數二，職工人數四十四，每日生產能力一五〇袋，已開工。年豐（民營被統制），馬達座數三，鋼磨部數四，職工人數三十，每日生產能力一〇〇袋，已開生。裕甡（民營被統制）馬達座數三，鋼磨部數四，職工人數四十三，每日生產能力一〇〇袋，已七工。　　（三）常州：成餘（民營被統制），馬達座數八，鋼磨部數八，職工人數一百二十六，每日生產能力二四〇〇袋，己復工。信和（民營被統制）馬達座數四，鋼磨部數四，職工人數五十八，每日生產能力一二〇〇袋，現正籌劃復工。恒豐（敵營）廠屋焚毁，機件破壞，盈豐（民營被統制），馬達座數一，鋼磨部數一，職工人數十七，每日生產能力八〇袋，已開工。廣豐新（民營被統制）馬達座數一，鋼磨部數四，職工人數五十，侮日生產能力二〇〇袋，已開工。恒益（民營被統制馬達座數五，鋼磨部數二，職工人數四十三，每日生產能力一〇〇袋，已開工。鼎泰（民營被統制）馬達座數三，鋼磨部數八，職工人數一百二二眶，每日生產能力二〇〇〇袋，已復工。裕豐（民營未被統制）已開工。　　（四）鎭江：鎭江（民營被敵收買，馬達座數三，鋼磨部數二十四，職工人數一百三十四，每日生產能力二三〇〇袋，收歸官辦，已於本月十三日復工。　　（五）掦州：明記（民營被佔）並增加資產，淸理中。　　（六）溧陽：同豐興（民營僞軍强佔）機件損失殆盡。　　（乙）生產能力　　現在，再談他們的生產能力，根據調査所得的數字，蘇錫常三地的麵粉廠，每天可出粉二五八八〇包，事實上，目前因爲煤斤缺乏，因而各地電廠多不能日夜供給電流，以每天開開車十二小時計，可出粉一二九四〇袋，每月開車以二十六天計，每月可出粉三三五四四〇袋，每袋小麥以二百市斤凈麥一八〇市斤，製粉二七五袋計，月需小麥一三四，一〇六包，毛麥每包二百市斤，製成粉麩的需電六，五度，共需電八七二一四四度，煤每噸發電以四五〇度計，約需煤一九三八噸。這些數字，提出來的意思，也不過希望總攬全局的人們，能够注意到這一點，作統盤的籌劃和調配，原料和煤斤的缺乏，正是廠家所遭遇的困難，江蘇有這樣大的生產能力，何必讓他棄而不用，又何必讓他每天停車十二小時呢？　　（丙）兩個觀感　　此外，記者要提供兩點觀感，第一，利用各廠副產品：麩的產量約當於粉的四分之一，月出粉三三五四四〇袋，可出麩八三八六〇袋，麩皮可以製酒，飼豬，養馬，毛麥變成凈麥，就有下脚可得，其折耗率的爲十分之一，即每二百市斤一包的毛麥，就有二十市斤的下脚。江蘇各廠，月需一三四一七六包毛麥，就有二六八三五二〇市斤的下脚，下脚可以肥田，養鷄，飼豬，並無一點廢物。第二：蘇錫常的工商業，本來是枇當發達，工人數目也多，單就麵粉廠的工人的數

<p>商業新聞金米暴動壓平後　物價漸次疲落　　上週中行繼續拋售大量黃金，收縮通貨，黃金即於暴漲之後猛退，其他金融性各物，在銀根抽緊聲中，多吿軟化，米市塲一度發生風潮，亦因當局廳付得宜，幸吿平息，其餘各類商品，激升後于復均吿回疲，茲將各業動應分讀於后。　　烚赤　上週趨勢呈暴漲暴落局面，尤以週一鋒鋩尤甚，每十兩曾逾二百萬大關，惟好景不常，中間因中行無限制拋售黃金，收縮游資，以致人心頓虛，週二即由二百萬之頂高價猛挫至一七六萬元，週三起，徐徐下趨，最低在一五八萬，迄於週六，最後價爲一六二萬。　　外幣　外幣市勢甚堅，一則受黃金刺激，二則結匯者需胃孔股，故行懷慎與金市相競，週一因黃金猛漲，幣市交易熱鬧，由二三七〇盤高至二六六〇，週二曾創二七五〇元項峰，後退至二四五〇元，週三起與金市同吿下游，初由二四四〇元節節吿退，至週末最後價回至二二八〇元，港幣週一激昂至四七〇元，後即步軟，至週五已退至四二〇元，週六回升至四三〇元左右。　　統債　全週波動頗多，行情升降倏忽，自兪財長發表還本談話後，丙種即盤低至六千元間，一度又退至五千六百元左右，卒因投機者播弄是非，有說政府還本將以四十倍者，或謂銀行界要求以生活指數爲比例者，週三丙種復挺至六千五百元，終站六一五〇元，週四退至五二五〇元，週五回至五八五〇元，至週六最後價爲六千元，較前週末挫一千六百元，甲乙丁戊週初由五千七九百元降至四千二三百元，最低價在三千七八百元。　　華股　因當局拋售大量黃金，收縮銀根，投機者迫於頭寸，紛紛吐售，中聞雖有人拉提，欲振乏力，週一即吿軟化，週二微回，週三起逐步吿疲，永安紗廠，景福，新光，勤新，內衣，火柴，信和，中紡，榮豐均較前週軋小一成至二成光景，中法藥房市面反俏，聞因籌碼稀少所致。　　外股　在銀根趨緊聲中，萎靡不振，中途雖稍有波折，僅熱門股有套售，故升降不一，怡和紗廠週一即跌至一萬五八，英聯一萬五四，業廣六千四，會德豐二萬四五，怡啤三千八，紙業三千三，航業二千八，鋼業五千，週二再降，週三僅怡紗略回，價在一萬五四，其他均挫小，迄週末收價怡紗低見一萬三八，英聯一萬二九，業廣五千五，會德豐二萬三，怡啤三千三，紙業二千七五，航業二千三五，鋼業三千八，均與前週小一二成不等。　　糧食　週初食米市塲，因發生糾紛，市况極度混亂，無正式市價，麵粉以當局不准出口或轉口，人心惶恐，塲外喊價較上週低四·〇〇〇元，黃豆賡績高漲，平湖粗豆約升一成左右，餘亦　三五千元不等，生仁轉形平定，食汕展開猛烈跌風，生汕幾挫萬元，豆汕猛瀉一萬四千元，豆餅則上落殊少，糖市微降，週二食米初開尙形堅定，旋以現貨充斥，各米號存底充實，無意高吸，軋低頗多，麵粉市勢轉秀，較昨高五百元至千元，黃豆趨勢軟化，生仁略俏一二千元，食汕方面除生油稍形上漲外，餘均下挫，食糖漲跌參差，週三食米市况初呈頹勢，嗣以另銷店略有吸胃，又因陰雨人心轉挺，高粳微升五百元，糯米去化平庸，反挫二三千元，麵粉市勢平穩，雜糧中黃豆大部隨汕價下跌數百元，僅平湖粗續升千元，食油到貨湧躍，一致續入下游，食糖方面，中砂散戶以銀根緊迫，紛紛斬售，略吿下跌，餘尙平穩，週四食米因產區價落，多數回挫五百元，麵粉以多頭出籠，市勢亦呈不支，黃豆生仁迎袂下游，週五食米初呈堅挺，及後以銀根緊迫，吞胃平平，相率下降，中以　元潟三千五百元爲最疲，粉市轉定，雜糧亦以迫於銀根，一致削弱，食汕初平，後吿不支，食糖除中砂供求相埒，尙形穩定外，餘均下跌，週六食米到貨尙暢，價又挫五百元至千元，惟中下等薄稻反形略升，粉因各方收購，突漲四五百元，雜糧食汕亦均吿上掦。　　現紗　在上週間，初因環境空氣利於多頭，黃金與美鈔騰踴，新買戶與補空旺盛，市勢飛黃騰達，星二廿支特雙馬高峯曾創一百卅八萬，其他各紗亦無不俱創高價，十六支紗亦均漲至一百萬關口，嗣後以黃金曁美鈔俱下落，客帮實際去化時斷時續，多頭逢高轉賣，重小至一百十八萬，迄至最後，略見轉機，週間變動之烈，爲邇來罕有，全週間以四二支藍鳳二百〇八萬爲最高，十支同心八十萬爲最低，若以支數言，則粗紗俏而細紗軟，卅二支藍鳳漲十八萬，十支　子軍漲九萬，廿支及士六支各漲三五萬，惟四十二支藍鳳則跌十四萬。　　布市　初受金價曁美鈔漲風刺激，勢亦向榮，入後以客需欠發展，價轉鬆勢，結果以十六磅花蝶等各漲四千爲最多，其餘如士林嗶嘰灰光斜各漲二千，十二磅龍頭細布新老貨各僅漲千元云。　　花市　廠家與花號前半週需要尙暢，週末幾呈停頓，市勢先俏後鬆，結果各花較前扯小二三千之譜。　　絲綢　上週內絲綢普遍下降，人造絲慘瀉更鉅，一二〇號大橋週一一百八十五萬元，直至週末每日跌落十餘萬或四五萬不等，總計共短去四十萬元之鉅，雜牌小三十六萬元，七五半光小三十二萬元，其慘跌之原因，不外因銀根奇緊，綢廠有配給原料，及中紡公司大量拋售之故，廠經一週內交易，頗覺寂寥，洋行貨成交甚稀，市價週一與週末相較，八一分勻度計小十萬元之譜，高級與中級貨，計小十五萬元左右，普通貨及干經，約短十萬元許，綢貨於週二突呈高漲，週三即吿回跌，美亞被面一週內總計短十七萬元，大誠格子　縐共小五百元弱，其他綢貨，類皆低落，且交易亦頗有限，綢廠已經開工，實銷難望起色，據該業中人云，綢廠商處此環境之下，實未許樂觀。　　其他　至於其他各業，呈暴漲徐落局面，因此生活指數又見高升，燃料全週呈穩定局面，煤柴炭市價鮮有變動，日用品因執貨者故意居奇，人心恍惚，乍升乍降，固本皂高見五萬六千元，低見五萬二千元，敵僞產業處理局雖有日用品平價配給，但因原料及成本日增，各廠家均抱觀望，持價應市，故交易並不旺盛，桐油，五金，捲煙，呢絨，及西藥，工業原料等大都呆定，交易亦稀。南菲發現優秀金鑛　　〔路透社南菲約翰內斯堡四日電〕最近南菲洲某金鑛公司在橘河自由邦奧登達爾村附近發見歷史上空前豐富之金鑛，計每噸鑛石中含有純金一千二百五十二本尼威脫，（Pennyweights）（等於六八·六盎司），照目前金價計算，等於每噸鑛石五百九十磅，按南菲金鑛含量通常爲十二本尼威脫，八十至一百本尼威脫即認爲意外收獲，此項消息傳出以後，該公司之股票即自三十二先令漲至八十先令。美棉來華　兩萬包即起運　美棉借款之首批　　當局爲振興吾國紡織業，曾與美國訂立美棉借款，美金三千三百萬元，以購買美棉來華，據悉此項美棉，首批二萬包，業已由美啓運來華，於短時期內，即可運抵本市，其他亦絡續可以運到，按本市國營與民營紗廠，所開紗錠的有一百二十餘萬錠，尙有三分之一紗錠，因原棉不敷，未能開動，一俟大量美棉到達之後，全部紗錠，均可開工，此項美棉到滬後將暫儲於敵僞產業處理局，最近所　空之「公和祥」等碼頭倉庫，然後陸續分配各廠應用云。馬來亞當局　不許華人種稻　　（路透社新加坡五日電）華僑橡皮種植業協會之某代表主張由當局撤銷禁止華人種稻之命令，目前僅馬來亞人得以種稻，其禁止華人種稻之用意，蓋在防止土地之移轉，麻拉甲華僑領袖唐孝新稱，准許華人種稻，並移入馬來亞境居住始足援救糧食危局。鴻基發生工潮白煤來源受阻　　安南鴻基煤礦所出產之鴻基白煤爲製造煤球最佳原料，經燃料管理委員會疏通後，來源漸暢，四月份共運到二萬噸，已足敷全市煤球製造廠之需，故各煤球廠最近均已恢復開工，惟昨據該會消息，最近該煤礦發生工潮，工人阻撓運輸，故最近五日該地並無煤輪蒞滬，惟該礦工潮即可解決，且滬上所存儲之鴻基白煤存底尙豐，對於各製球廠之生產，不致有何影饗云。美華僑醵資　購土貨運美　　僑居美國之華商，最近舉行華商協會第四十二届年會，該會擁有代表二百餘人，會中僉認過去敷年我國出口貨物太少，在美之酒菜館及洗衣業均希望國內有茶·香料乾疎菜·晒乾之水菜運入美國，故決議籌集二百萬美金匯回國內，採購土產運美。美華合辦汽車廠　地點當在上海或南京　　據此間工業界消息，美國汽車製造廠，頃擬在南京或上海，與國人合辦一大規模之汽車製造廠，內部製造設備，完全由美運來，預期每年可產汽車十萬至二十萬輛，其中除一部份汽車，爲客車外，大部均爲遝貨大卡車，與公用汽車，據悉，此項計劃，若國內政治能臻安定，即可實現云。鹽商營業衰落　準備向當局呼籲　　本市食鹽，自鹽務局以每担萬四千元平價配銷以來，各鹽商營業一落千丈，究其原因有如下述：（一）受限價之約束，嬴利無多，（二）配銷之鹽，其質較差，且任何人均可請求配給，因之銷路不暢，（三）目前兩淮之鹽，爲共軍所阻，不能出運，餘姚塲之鹽，復限制運銷浙東浙西，靑島之鹽則限運漢口，各鹽商無法至產地直接購運，開滬上一百八十餘家鹽商擬於本月二十日左右召開鹽商同業公會成立大會時，將用公會名義，向鹽務局請求兩點：（一）將餘姚塲產鹽劃歸本地運銷，（二）輸出時業經納稅，至吳淞口進口時要求不另徵稅云。美政府促各國　結束駐美授權購機關　國際貿易將恢復常態　　〔聯合社華盛頓四日電〕美國已要求十五國外國政府，包括全部戰時盟國在內，及早解散其駐美採購委員會，此乃使貿易脫離國營而入於商營範圍之迅速行動，據國務院宣布之政策，謂官方機關如長此繼續從事世界貿易，則〔此類國營貿易機關，應依照普遍商業觀點，進行貿易，〕此項政策可望成爲來日對蘇貸款談判中重大問題之一，美國顉望蘇聯接受約束，使其國營貿易機關不用其力量於政治目標，而僅以普通商業目標為限，國務院在其聲明中對於採辦委員會之遲不撤消，僅承認一種情形為合法，即〔在過渡時期，政府或須繼續參與貿易，以迅速促成世界經濟改紐，穩定物價及所有物資之平等分配〕惟此種因素，亦惟全世界之生活與政治條件是賴，據外交界負責人士談稱，政治上恢復平時常態之最大發展，當爲中國　九省及伊朋境內駐軍全部或近乎全部　　　　。　　　　久疲不振，此次各物競起漲風，獨柏汕依然如故，雖人心稍見振奮，亦僅曇花一現，仍歸寂滅，總因銷塲斷續靡常，未能挽頹風於萬一，且到貨時有，尙在供過於求狀熊之中，非得皂用頻動，恐一時未易轉機，茲各行付售本軍油六英元，內坪油四萬八千元，的千四萬五千元，獨砠四萬二千元，蘭油三萬八千元，麻城三萬五千元。肺病特效藥　在硏究增產中　　（中央社台北四日電）台大敎授陳禮節博士向中央社記者稱，關於肺病特效藥左旋性洛丁酸，陳長官已允撥款繼續硏究及增產，結核硏究所與製藥工廠，均可望於最短期間成立，目前從事是項工作硏究及籌備者，有敎授八人，陳氏表示右旋性洛丁酸藥之硏究及製造，亦在計劃中。左右旋性洛丁酸均係由檜樹提煉而出。台灣盛產檜樹，故一般人均感飽途樂觀。陳氏復稱，將接收官　加股，設立藥廠，並擬在上海等地籌設分廠。染織業之　貨物稅與營業稅問題  諸尙一　　最近染織同業，困貨物稅與營業稅之徵收，對於各該稅則發生疑義頗多，歸納言之：（一）貨物稅與統稅有無區別？（二）棉紗征稅之後，棉布是否亦需再誤？其非單總織廠，即自紡自織之工廠，有於織成棉布後，始行完納出廠稅者，是否得免征營業稅？（三）假使自紡自織之工廠，係於棉布出廠時始行完稅，因而得免征營業稅；但單純織廠於購進棉紗時，已在事實上負担由紗廠轉嫁而來之棉紗出廠稅，同時於織成棉布銷售之後，又須完納營業稅，是否有一源兩稅之弊？其與非單純織廠相較是否負担特多，有失公平，今姑置事實於不問，專就法理論之。　　貨物稅者，爲以貨物爲課徵標之稅。國家對某一特定貨物，予以徵課，不論爲產稅，爲銷稅，爲取締稅，皆屬貨物我之範圍。統稅係就該特定之貨物，於其出產或出廠時征收之稅，於完稅之後，運銷各地，概免重征。故統稅之對象亦爲貨物，而爲貨物稅之一種，但貨物稅並非僅包括統稅一項。例如染織同業問題所在之稅法爲「修正貨物統稅條例」，但鹽稅雖亦爲貨物稅之一種，却自有其稅法，不能適用「修正貨物統稅條例」是。　　統稅完納之後，既免重徵，在法理上係屬「一物一稅」之原則。非若其他以貨物爲標的而微課之稅，得於征課產稅之外，兼課銷稅，或併課取締稅。是爲統稅之基本精神所在。爲貫澈此一精神計，統稅之完課，應在該貨出廠或出產時，其國外輸入之各該貨物，以不能就塲微課，因而由海關於進口稅之外，另按統稅率計徵統稅，雖屬例外，亦爲事實所限，不得不爾。足見立法原意，在使國貨與外貨同其負祖，不致使餃爭能力有所徧頗，實合稅法公平之原則。　　惟是統稅「一物一稅』之原則，其稱成條件有二：即（甲）必需爲法律所特定之貨物，非然者，即不能享受一物一稅之權利，亦不應承負此種義務。（乙）必需囿於對物稅之範圍。其因對人，對事，對行爲，曁對收益所課之稅，即使此人，此事，此一行爲，曁此收益所自，皆發源於該一貨物之產銷分佈，要其徵課對象已非該項貨物本身，自不能受「一物一稅」原則之拘束，至屬明顯。　　依據現行稅法，應征統稅之貨物共凡六類，棉紗亦其一種。本上所述，納稅貨物之種類既係列舉的，即凡未在列舉之內者，均無繳納統稅之義務。故單純織廠所產棉布之不應繳納出產稅，固無庸贅論，其自紡自織者，於其紡的成品部分應納統稅，而於織的部份，則絕無負担統稅之理，亦爲天經地義之解釋。至於因自紡自織之故，爲便利稽征計，因而於棉布出廠時始行徵課，亦宜以每疋棉布之含紗量從價徵課，不得併同織布工繳曁織布利潤計征，始與法意相符非然者，，在該非單純織廠平白多一額外之負担；在財政當局無殊自行破壞稅法之完整性矣。　　棉紗完納統稅之後，依營業稅法第五條第三款之規定，其納稅之工廠或出章八免納營業稅。査棉紗之納稅議務人爲紗廠。故在事實上，紗廠雖已將所納統稅轉嫁於織廠，但在法律上，享受此項免稅權利者，仍爲紗廠。蓋如前述：統稅爲對物稅，而營業稅爲行爲稅。行爲稅係對侮一行爲爲課徵之標的者，不受統稅「一物一稅」原則之拘束。故除紗廠之營業行爲，以法律明又轄免營業稅之繳納義務外，其運銷該項棉紗之商號，統應於每一交易行爲完畢之後，完納營業稅。單純繳廠之銷售者爲棉布，更不必論。至於自紡自織之工廠，既在法理上應就其紡的部份課以統稅，則在織的部份之營業行爲自不能援是而免徵營業稅。由是以言，單純織廠與非單純織廠間之負稅數率，固無異致，競爭能力自不因之而生影響。　　綜上所述：統稅爲對法令所列舉之貨物，於其出產或出廠時所徵收之一種貨物稅。與染織同業有關之應納統稅貨物爲棉紗一項，棉布則不然，亦不應負繳納統稅之義務。但享受免繳營業稅之權利者爲紗廠，或自紡自織工廠之紡的部份，其織的部份與單純織廠之營業仍應依其營業收入總額完納營業稅。　　至是有不能已於言者二端，請述之如后：　　（一）統稅與營業稅，在純法理的觀點上，固爲兩個納稅主體曁客體。但紗廠之出廠稅，事實上係由購紗之織廠承負。織廠於紗之進廠，則負担轉嫁而來之統稅，於布之銷售，則負担營業稅。法律於名義上之統稅納稅人，則轄免營業行爲所應納之營業稅；於事實上之統稅負担者，則惟恐其負担之不重，復益以營業稅。事之不平，莫甚於此。此不能已於言者一。　　（二）現行稅法並未明定對棉布有所微課，故海關曁貨物稅局萬無藉口稽征，勒征出廠稅之理。但據傳非單純織廠之稅局駐廠員，往往於該廠紡的部份徵課棉紗統稅之餘，復就其織的部份徵課棉布出廠稅。姑無論其於法無據，即使謂爲嚴密稽征，不得不爾，准於棉布出廠完稅之後，得申請退回棉紗統稅；但棉布出廠稅之數額，是否係依侮疋棉布之實際含紗量從價計征，亦殊難言。又，棉布出口，必需有統稅單始能報關，此在往時，爲稽征之故而有分運單之辦法，今稽征既無一定辦法，舊法似廢而又不廢，織廠爲圖出口便捷計，往往又另納棉布出廠稅以應命。誠不知此項出廠稅依據何項條文，何項法理！筆者愚見，紗廠（包括非單純織廠之紡廠部份在內）既已駐有稅務人員，完稅或逃稅之責任，即應由紗廠曁駐廠稅務員負之。織廠（包括非單純織廠之織廠部份在內）萬艱以稽征之故，而負担額外之稅額。分運單之辦法，行之已久，尙無流弊，似仍可採行。倘財政當局認爲無可採者，亦宜從速另訂辦法。在無辦法前，依法棉布旣非應納統稅之貨物，自得自由出廠，自由出口，萬不能藉口稽征，使人民有莫知適從之感。此不能已於言者二。謭陋之見，希明達有以敎之。敵產處理局　第四批標售工廠　　敵偽產業處理局第四批樑售之工廠，共有八十五單位，其中以產權糾紛或因其他關係，暫行保留者有十七單位，故實際標售者僅爲六十八單位，其中工廠佔四十一家，物資器材佔二十七起，共收到標函七十五件，可歸納爲三十五單位，內廿四單位係工廠，十一單位係器材部份，聞正由審議會審核中，不日即可將得標者予以公佈云。開煤兩萬噸　不日可望裝運來滬　　秦皇島開灤煤礦經當局積極整頓後，產量激增，現每月達三十萬噸以上，除供給華北各地應用以外，均將運銷本市以及華中各省，上週燃料管理委員會已派出英美輪多艘，裝運巨額煤斤來滬，現該會又復派遣美輪中山號，沙格號，英輪有格馬勒號駛往秦皇島繼續裝運，預計本週杪，至少可裝煤二萬噸來滬。香港工廠　　必須設於工廠區域　區外各廠勒限遷移　　〔香港訊〕香港勞工處，自正式宣佈全港大小各工廠重新登記註册後，各工廠之前往登記者，未見踴躍，蓋大部份工廠對於工廠與衛生及消防等條例，未能邀守，故勞工處當局必須各工廠依照各項規條辦妥，然後始行發牌，但其中最重要者，則爲各廠現多設置於非工廠區域之內，根據工廠設立規條，凡新設立之工廠，如非設立於工廠區域，如堅尼地城，筲箕灣，深水埗等地域之內，則不准許其設立，刻下各工廠因在戰爭時所受之影響，多胡亂擇一地址設立，又或新設立者，亦多不明此規條，月來為勞工局飭令遷往工廠區域設立者甚多，但當局鑑於目前工廠區屋宇之缺乏，不得已設於非工廠區之工廠，皆予以三個月至六個月之寬限，但今後新設立之工廠，對於此點，須加以特別注意云。日本經濟狀況　丙三年後可穩定　　〔合眾社華整頓四日電〕據英國某官員今日估計，日本經濟欲獲致高度之穩定，非兩三年不可，該完全熟悉遠東經濟背景之某官員，吿合衆社稱，渠相信有三件因素，遲延日本經濟之恢復，便不克迅復至盟國政策所預期之水準，按其性質之重要排列，應爲（一）物質的缺乏，（二）政治之不穩定（三）食糧之恐荒，英國計劃奪取德國顏料市場　　〔路透社倫敦五日電〕帝國化學工業組織，昨日宣佈以九百萬鎊作爲發展英國主要工廠及供硏究實騐用之計劃，目的在奪取德國顏料工業前所控制之海外市塲，按云年十二月該組織曾宣佈以一千萬鎊生產化學原料之計劃，紐約棉市（四日）　　（單位美元百磅計）　　五月期　　A二七·五〇　　B二七·五〇　　七月期　　A二七·五八　　B二七·五八　　支加哥小麥　　（單位美分以美斗計）　　五月期一八三1/2　　七月期一八三1/2　　九月期一八三1/2美加汽車產量　　〔路透社迭標律五日電〕上週內美加兩國之客車與卡車產量，據「華德〕所發表之汽車生產報吿書佔計，約爲六七·五八五單位，前週產量爲六四·六二〇單位，上年數字僅二〇·四七〇單位，一九四一年之同一星期內，則有一三〇·六一〇單位云，按自民間生產狀况重新恢復以來，上週之產量數字已新剏一高紀錄經濟簡報　　四聯總處奉令舉辦廠礦復工貸款，自去秋開始舉辦以來，迄今已貸出之款項，計逾一百八十餘億元，無論國營民營　礦均可前往申請，惟必須合於經濟復員政策，確係用於增加生產者。　　行總在四月份內共計運七〇二一九噸物資入內地及其他港口，其中食物佔三〇二三七噸，其主要救濟之地區爲漢口八五二七噸，開封四一〇二噸，富有營養之物如乾牛奶及奶粉，較三月份增加六八〇〇噸，尙有二二二七噸布及一九四六噸鞋襪等運入，作救濟難民及失業工人之用。　　塔斯社莫斯科五月四日電，未來五年內，蘇聯預定建立新廣播電台二十八座，而無綫電收音機之生產，亦將大增，新五年計劃規定生產無綫電器具三百萬套，若十城市內將設立無綫電傳形器中心，而無綫電傳形器則將大量生產。　　頃據進出口業權威方面稱：最近本市各進出口行向美實華藥廠所定之大宗藥品，業已絡續到滬，並有印刷及油漆用之金粉，搪瓷及玻璃陶器用之碗靑等，新貨業已運到，又美國製造之DDT尙有玻璃褲帶等物品，均將於本月內到滬。　　中蠶公司以繭易絲辦法，第一批經審査合格者共二十一家，現又以存繭三千担，仍照第一批辦法，交由各絲廠代繅，登記絲廠，頗爲踴躍，該公司已定在日內開始審査。　　華僑鉅子胡文虎氏，決集資開採閩西永定龍岩一帶無烟煤礦，並擬築輕便鐵道，以通海口。美國發明新防腐劑　新殺蟲劑勝過DDT　　〔路透社紐的五日電〕奴杜克斯物產公司經理宣佈，該公司已能生產若干種新化學藥品，可以防止疋頭，皮革等物生霉。此等藥品對於原物毫無損害，亦不影響更進一步之加工製造。此外，新無毒防腐劑一種，亦已製造成功，對於裝運易於腐敗之食物極爲有用，結果不必使用冷藏裝置矣。此種防腐劑無味無臭，因此對於保藏食物尤爲適宜，據試騐結果，聞對於保藏麵包，蔬菓汁，乾酪，新鮮水果汁，均能適用。復次，該公司並宣佈發明新殺蟲劑一種，聞其効力，較DDT有過之無不及，名爲〔一〇六八。對於若干種昆蟲，其效力勝過DDT數倍，可用以防止毛織品生蛾。此種藥品無毒而不引火，滲透力極速且勻。乾洗或暴露於空氣中，均不致影響其効用。上海新企業調查　　美豐建業　股份有限公司爲徐瑞章等所發起，資本五千萬元，由發起人認定二十分之一，餘公開招募，以經營毛紡織染工廠及羊毛工業機件之進出口爲業務。　　中新企業　股份有限公司，係黃金榮等所發起，資本二千萬元已全部認足，事務所設雲南南路餘慶里十號，其業務為（一）工商實業之經營或投資，（二）倉庫及運輸業務，（三）房地產之投資或買賣，（四）承辦建築工程及設計。　　萬象織造廠　股份有限公司，資本四千萬元，由發起人傳隆才等認定二分之一，以織造手帕及其有關事業爲業務。　　國泰電業廠　股份有限公司，資本三千萬元，已由發起人趙魯卿解全部認足，以製造電氣材料及用具爲業務。　　遠東產物保險　股份有限公司，資本二千萬元，已由發起人鄒駕白等全部認足。　　永新漂染起毛廠　股份有限公司，資本六百萬元，由發起人吳問源等全部認足，以代客漂染棉織品及起毛爲業務。　　百樂實業　股份有限公司，發起人爲姜次烈等，資本六千萬元已認足，其業務爲發展農林漁業，協助工廠生產，調劑供求運輸等。　　勵羣貿易　股份有限公司，爲蔡國基等所發起，資本五百萬元，已全部認足，以食物罐頭紙類洋貨之進口，生絲茶葉猪鬃刺繡品之出口爲業務。　　中國環球產物保險　股份有限公司，爲金宗城等所發起，資本五千萬元，分爲五十萬股，發起人認足廿六萬三千股，餘公開招募，地點在仁記路一二〇號。　　衆興企業　股份有限公司，爲汪伯繩等所發起，資本五千萬元，已全部認足，其業務分國外國內貿易兩部。　　寰球自行車　股份有限公司，爲徐國懋等所發起，資本一千萬元，已全部認足。來函紡建標售紗綫　建議改良辦法　　大戰之後，物資缺乏，我國紡織事業，急待恢復，近來紡建開標各牌紗錢，廠號家紛紛請購，而所得數量，如20支42/2雙股等，均以按戶分配一件爲限，如是者，已辦過數度，此項標售辦法，實有改革之必要，因廠行號性質不同，必須分類分配，以單純織廠，全靠紡建方面得到之紗綫，方可以補充其原料，而行號則不免囤積投機，從中取利。故請紡建當局，對於單純織廠，另立一格式，先令各廠，塡具布機若干台，每日夜產量多少，按其範國之大小，以定紗綫分配之多寡，或亦增加生產，减少投機之一法乎。（曹爲成投函）戰後上海呢絨市價比較觀　　自事變以後，呢絨來路斷檔，加以通貨膨脹，行市升升　，頗有一日干里之概，茲以近十年躉批每碼市價，列表比較如下（單位法幣一元但三十二年度係以偽幣中儲券計算）　　貨別　廿六年五月一日　廿九年五月一日　卅二年五月一日　卅五年五月一日　　二八八法西襯　〇·六一〇　一·一〇〇　二〇　一八〇〇　　普通黑炭襯　一·一七五　三·三〇〇　七五　五一〇〇　　怡和派力司　三·八〇〇　一一·五〇〇　四〇〇　四一〇〇〇　　九一八素嗶嘰　三·〇五〇　九·五〇〇　四〇〇　三五〇〇〇　　豐裕白嗶嘰　六·二五〇　二四·〇〇〇　七七五　五七五〇〇　　三十九厚嘰嘰　四·八〇〇　一八·〇〇〇　五八〇　三五〇〇〇　　財神虎華達呢　四·四〇〇　一五·〇〇〇　六二五　三五〇〇〇　　財神虎直貢呢　五·四〇〇　一九·〇〇〇　六五〇　三九〇〇〇　　二二二白直貢　七·〇〇〇　三一·〇〇〇　九〇〇　六一〇〇〇　　天馬灰法蘭絨　四·七〇〇　一七·五〇〇　六五〇　三九〇〇〇　　四五六薄花呢　二·八〇〇　一〇·〇〇〇　三七五　二四〇〇〇　　一六七西裝呢　七·七五〇　三六·〇〇〇　一·五〇〇　六七五〇〇　　頭號元馬褲呢　五·二五〇　二三·〇〇〇　八二五　三五〇〇〇　　頭號制服呢　二·八〇〇　七·五〇〇　二五〇　一二五〇〇　　本廠絲光羽紗　〇·六八〇　　·九〇〇　三四　二七五〇　　英製元色子貢　九·〇〇〇　三六·〇〇〇　一·四〇〇　六七五〇〇</p>

<p>生產建設特輯英國　家化學工業公司貝林翰工業區巡禮前言  楊存如　　天日重光以還「上海工業化」之呼聲，甚囂市上。惟以大規模工業區之創設，縝密之全盤計劃，尤爲先決要件。而吾人若能以他國之已成事業，資爲借鏡，則事半功倍，常在意中。筆者有鑒於此，爰爲迻譯本篇，以備本市有志人士之參考。　　試把英國皇家化學工業公司（即本市英商卜內門公司的母公司）在貝林翰的許多工廠當作一個單位看，其規模之宏大，可說是世間寥寥可數的了。該工業區位在英國北部提斯河的左岸，佔地一千英畝有餘，沿岸碼頭廠屋林立，深入內地有一哩半之遙。　　爲對於這個工業區的規模的廣宏，有更深切的認識起見，我們不妨將該區內的公用事業數字，和他處作一個比較。區內的自來水廠，每日的進水量，大至一百萬噸，除倫敦區內是有加倍的數字外，比在英國的任何其他的城市多。燃燒用及工業用的煤氣消耗量，侮小時達四百五十萬立方尺，亦祗有在倫敦能達到這樣大的產量。發電廠能經常供給六萬千瓦時，那是全英國沒有可於抗衡的了。消耗於水·電·蒸汽的煤，每日達三千噸，年計百萬噸。區內共有公路十二哩，鐵道八十哩。　　這樣規模的工業區，却是新近在極短時期內創造起來的。這個奇積當然是因爲當地有了天時地利人和三者有利的環境，還有縝密的計劃，加以運用的緣故。就原料方面說，當地的煤，灰石礦，粘土及鹽出產豐富。外來的有木焦汕和燐礦石，可以海陸聯運，大量裝到。區內的碼頭倉庫設備，可以吞收大量原料，吐放製成品到世界各角去。四外鐵道縱橫，聯達國內各處。區內水電供應充份，鋼鐵製品都可以就地取用。要說人力，附近有鎭市多處，羣居着許多有訓練的工人，交通便利，一呼即至。因爲原料的齊備，所以各種工業極易發展。含有氫·氣·氧·碳等的化學品，是以空氣，水·煤·及木焦油作爲原料。鈣類及硫類是以灰石礦。而鈉類及氣類製品，只是用鹽而已。　　這個龐大的工業區，內部分成若干系統，各司其事，有條不紊。最大的稱爲貝林翰系，專製以空氣·水·煤·灰石礦及木焦汕爲原料的出品。其南有加塞爾工廠，屬於通用化學系，專製以　爲原料的出品，和「潑司配師」不碎玻璃的基體。另有「可塑體」系的工廠來完成這基體的加工。這許多系統，雖說是各自爲政，却有高度的聯繫。凡是水，電，蒸汽，煤氣，電話，公路，鐵道，工塲等，都取給于同一源流。勞工福利事業，消防安全設備，衛生工作，築屋問題等，亦都集中管理，以收宏效。　　各廠共用員工　一萬三千名，祗是「貝林翰』系，已經佔用一萬名。提斯河二岸村落，如星棋密佈，都是依着這工業區而崛興的。皇家化學工業公司自建的住屋已有二千餘所之多。　　在勞工福利方面，該公司盡力培養工人們的「羣育」，使他們安居樂業。養老金及其他福利事業，都依着該公司一貫的政策和公式，有了相當的成就。區內更築有中央俱樂部大厦，內包括有戲院，圖書館等，作爲全區的社交及遊樂的中心。工作環境的改良，是該公司無時或懈的。凡是有關於完全設備，救急醫藥衛生事宜，甚至於更衣室，小食店，都隨時加以改良添設。生產珍聞  美　　三輪汽車　　美國汽車製造商加萊台維斯已作下了三輪汽車的製造計劃，可能在六個月內開始在加利福尼亞州製造。這種汽東重一千磅，有四汽缸，六汽缸，八汽缸等幾種。四汽缸的一種每加侖汽油可走四十哩，尋常速度每小時六十五哩，最高速度八十哩。（譯自十月六日「商業週報」）治肺藥物　　治療肺癆向無特效藥，唯據最近獲得消息，美國研究此項藥品的工作，每週均有新進展。據加利福尼亞大學博士塞爾宣布，新近他已從稻草中發現一種新藥汁，且已在試騐。然據一般估計這種藥汁可能和其他多種殺害癆菌藥品相同，不適服用。此外還有一種大豆化鍊的新藥物，這種藥品性質溫和常不至損害人體，惟其殺菌力量如何則尙有待硏究。（譯自十月一日美「時間雜誌」）五彩傳眞　　美五彩無綫電傳眞儀器發明人哥爾馬克比近又發明雷達無綫電傳眞儀器。該傳眞器較通常傳眞器的傳眞速率快十倍，電台採用雷達傳眞器後，其廣播節目即將呈現五彩而且較原先詳細二倍半可呈現於收音聽衆之前。（譯自十月卅一日「紐約時報」）滅鼠新藥　　美國某魚鮮公司發明一種稱爲『一〇八〇』的滅鼠藥，它是美國很好的滅鼠藥，無味而且藥性極烈，惟其因為常人如誤服該藥五十分之一盎司就有喪生的危險，還不准使用，製造『一〇八〇』的唯一廠家宣布該藥除供給防疫人員外絕不出售。（譯自十二日邪惡四日「時代」）人造橡皮  蘇咸　　美國的人造橡皮製造，已具有把握。據稱可以應付戰前各方所需的數量。　　天然橡皮的售價頗昻，所以人造橡皮的代價可以同他競爭。現今世界各國橡皮的消耗量，每年需三百五十萬噸。人造大然橡皮的產量，可得二百七十萬噸。工商管理概論  徐百益　　需要和供應　　工商業的發達，可以說是工作趨於專門化的結果，在人類沒有進化的漁獵時代也有物物交換的情形，漁人把他所捉到的魚，去換獵人所獵到的東西，人類的生活愈進步，那末各人所做的事，也愈加專門化起來。一個理髮師就專們做理髮師，當他要洗浴的時候，就要跑到浴室裏去。各有其業。各事其事，因此凡是不是一個人本行裏的事，就要去請敎專家，這樣彼此就有了接觸，也就產生了供應）Supply）和需要（Demand）的法則了。　　供應和需要，是有連帶關係的，牠們決不能單獨行動，而價格是工作的一種工具。譬如說供應方面，根據自己的成本，就能定出價格，使需要的一方，起而購買，購買的一方，見所定的價格是相巧的，於是就起購買的動作，供應和購買，因此就發生了關係。同時如果供應一方面因爲購買的人很少，就可以抑低售價，使銷行較爲迅速，反轉來講，購買的一方面，如果以為價格太高，就可以要求減低價格。所以價格是周旋於供應者和需要者兩方面的中間人。　　需要是什麽？　　第一，要使需要對於價格產生影響，這個需要，必須除了有需要的意思以外，還要有購買的願望，而能够給付相當的代價。譬如一家工廠，很有意思購買十萬磅糖，但是他們的經濟力量，祗能够購買二萬磅，所以糖的數量在十萬磅，以外的，不能迎合他們的需要，也不會發生什麼影響，他們所能夠產生影響的，是在二萬磅以內，如果價格相當，他們的需要，就得到供應了。　　介是貨品的代價，是有伸縮性的，有時候要受到同類出品或代替品的影響，譬如說道林紙印刷東西，固然比報紙淸楚，但是用報紙印刷也能够勝任，那末如果道林紙，每令二百元，而報紙每令只有五十元，本來想用道林約印刷的，也許要改用報紙，這就是代替品價格所產生的影響。　　在現在工商界裏，同業的競爭，是相當劇烈的，即使是質料相同的貨品，因爲甲廠大量生產，所以成本比乙廠的低，售價也比乙廠為廉，因此甲廠的貨品，就有更多的銷售的機會。　　除了價格的問題之外，尙有其他的問題，足以使貨品易於銷行，譬如甲的貨品比較地經用，或者甲廠的貨品，曾做過更多的廣吿，所以知道的人也更多，因此銷售的機會也比較地多了。　　無論那種工商業，終希望能够增加大衆的需要量，因爲需要的數量增多以後，他們的生產量，也可以增多，每年所得的利潤，也可以較多，這就有幾種方法。一種是利用優美的廣吿，使大衆閱讀以後，立即購買，使貨品的銷路，因而擴展起來。還有一種方法，就是把貨品的式樣，更改得更新更完善，而仍舊賣固有的價錢，這一種方法，可以說是變相的跌價，因爲貨品質料改進以後，成本不免增高，利潤不免减少，但因爲需要增多，大量生產以後，多中取利，也許比原來的利潤更多一點。同時一種貨品的品質，改進以後，銷售比較容易，雖則製造的成本不得不增加，但銷售的費用却可以减少，仍舊能够合乎經濟之道。　　事實上把貨品改進的一個步驟是很合理，而比減低售價是更好的措置，因爲貨品的質料改進以後，就比較地容易銷售，銷售愈廣那末聲譽愈隆，而基礎日就鞏固。反轉來講，如果把售價减低，而依舊沒有銷路，大衆對於貨品因爲沒有進步而逐漸淡忘，對於貨品的前途，是大有損害的。　　一個管理的人才，必須對於市塲的情形非常熟悉，要知道各種貨品的趨勢，和一般的情形，因爲別人的舉動，和同類貨品的一舉一動，都是足以影響自身的，如果一味的閉門造車，那末勢必不能和別人競爭，自己的生存，也許要發生問題，更談不到發展了。</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 5th Dispatch] The grand ceremony for the National Government's return to the capital and the anniversary of the founding of the revolutionary government was solemnly held at the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum at 9:00 AM on the 5th. Chairman Chiang led the rituals and delivered an address after paying respects at the mausoleum, urging the nation with eight points: (1) abstain from wastefulness, (2) value frugality, (3) eliminate selfishness, (4) eradicate arrogance and deceit, (5) uphold propriety and righteousness, (6) know integrity and shame, (7) take responsibility, and (8) abide by discipline. The words were earnest and hit the nail on the head, deeply moving all who heard them. After the ceremony, the Chairman went to the plaza of the National Assembly Hall to participate in the capital's celebration of the National Government's return to the capital. When Chairman Chang, accompanied by his wife, stepped out of the car and entered the venue, the assembled 100,000 citizens cheered and shouted "Long live the Chairman," the sound resonating through the clouds for a long time. The citizens' enthusiasm was unprecedented.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 5th Dispatch] The celebration ceremony for the return of the National Government to the capital and the anniversary of the founding of the revolutionary government was held jointly at the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum at 9:00 AM on the 5th, marking the largest grand ceremony since the victory of the War of Resistance. Around 8:00 AM, over 5,000 civil and military officials and representatives of the people arrived one after another, lined up on both sides of the stone steps at the entrance of the memorial hall, civil officials on the right and military officials on the left, their ranks neat. Overlooking the winding mausoleum avenue, countless national flags fluttered in the wind amidst a green sea of pines and cypresses, beautiful and solemn, fully symbolizing the glorious triumphant return of our central government. At 9:00 AM sharp, Chairman Chiang, accompanied by his wife, arrived amidst enthusiastic applause. The Chairman wore a new army uniform of a Special-Grade General, adorned with medals, while the wife wore a black wool coat, frequently nodding and returning greetings to the participants. After entering the memorial hall, the grand ceremony began. Amidst the high strains of military music and the booming of 101 gun salutes, the Chairman took his place, sang the national anthem, and offered flowers. Zhang Daofan then respectfully read the proclamation. The Chairman then led the ritual as before, and the entire assembly observed three minutes of silence in front of the portrait of the Father of the Nation, as well as the national army and allied soldiers who died in the War of Resistance, and the compatriots who perished. Afterwards, he led the members of the Central Standing Committee, members of the National Government, heads of various ministries and commissions, and representatives of the Presidium of the Political Participation Council in a procession into the mausoleum, circling the mausoleum once, completing the ceremony. Stepping out of the memorial hall, the Chairman delivered a speech at the entrance to the participants, recalling the historical traces of eight years of suffering and pointing out the direction of future efforts, which lasted for five minutes. After the speech, he stepped down the stone steps with his wife, and all those who attended the ceremony followed and shouted softly, the echoes reverberating in the Purple-Gold Mausoleum Valley for a long time. Furthermore, the National Government's flag-raising ceremony was moved to the capital from the 5th onwards.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Chairman Addresses the Nation, Urging All Compatriots to Remember the Lessons of History and Cooperate Sincerely to Preserve the Glorious Fruits of Our Final Victory <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 5th Dispatch] Chairman Chiang attended the capital's celebration of the return to the capital on the 5th and delivered an address to the nation. The original text is as follows: "Fellow countrymen, soldiers, and civilians across the nation, today is the anniversary of the founding of the revolutionary government in Guangzhou by our Founding Father 25 years ago, and our National Government has also returned to Nanjing today. For eight years, we resisted Japan, relying on the consistent unity of our compatriots, supporting the national policy of resistance, obeying the central government's orders, persevering through setbacks, fighting bravely, sacrificing blood, and enduring hardships, finally achieving today's final victory, and abolishing all unequal treaties, washing away the century-old national humiliation of our Chinese nation. Today, Zhongzheng and our compatriots can still meet in the capital, gathering together, which is truly gratifying and truly the most memorable day in our Republic of China. However, recalling the tragedy of the Nanjing Massacre when the capital fell on December 13, 1937, we should learn from the pain and never forget the enslavement, the life of beasts of burden, the dark and hopeless existence we endured under the enemy's iron heel for eight years. We must be vigilant and strive to be self-reliant and self-strengthening. In particular, the national shame and humiliation of the September 18th Incident fifteen years ago, when Northeast Shenyang was invaded, should be deeply remembered as a permanent historical lesson for our Chinese nation for generations to come. Compatriots, so today the government returns to the capital, I believe it can only be seen as marking the end of our War of Resistance against Japan, that is, the national policy of our National Government to resist to the end, leading all soldiers and civilians to sacrifice and struggle to achieve a victory. But even though we have recovered Shenyang today, the integrity of the entire administration and sovereignty of the Northeast still requires all our compatriots to cooperate sincerely for the country and the nation, continuing to work hard to preserve the glorious fruits of our final victory. Only in this way can we comfort the spirits of the soldiers, civilians, and compatriots who sacrificed for the War of Resistance and the revolution in the past eight years. The National Government will continue to uphold the teachings of the Founding Father and the consistent spirit of the National Revolution, always leading our soldiers, civilians, and compatriots across the nation to move forward, realize the Three Principles of the People, and complete the mission of resisting Japan and building the nation. I hope that our compatriots across the nation can still use the confidence of certain victory in the past War of Resistance to shoulder the great cause of certain success in building the nation in the future. However, our compatriots across the nation should thoroughly recognize that the work of building the nation is more arduous and painful than the War of Resistance. However, although our work of building the nation is arduous, the national will is completely free, so our life of building the nation, though bitter, is still joyful. In short, amidst the victory and return to the capital with joyful cheers, reflecting on the past and thinking about the present, we feel even more the difficulty of achieving victory and the preciousness of the opportunity to build the nation. I hope that all our compatriots will unite with one heart and one mind, be pragmatic and realistic, and everyone will be committed to hard work, endurance, and practical action, encouraging each other with common unity and mutual assistance, so that our Chinese nation, the descendants of the Yellow Emperor, will never again suffer the tragedy and humiliation of foreign invasion and trampling like the past eight years. Therefore, I would like to make a few special requests to my compatriots today to serve as our common and consistent guiding principles for building the nation: (1) We must abstain from wastefulness, (2) We must value frugality, (3) We must uphold propriety and righteousness, (4) We must know integrity and shame, (5) We must take responsibility, and (6) We must abide by discipline. My wife and I are truly ashamed to receive such warm welcome and support from our compatriots today. We are deeply afraid of failing to live up to the expectations of our compatriots. We can only use the spirit of the past War of Resistance, be vigilant morning and night, follow all our compatriots, and support the National Government to build a new China that is unified, independent, equal, free, prosperous, strong, and happy, to fulfill the ultimate meaning of the support of our compatriots across the nation. I respectfully wish all soldiers and civilians across the nation a long life for the victory of the War of Resistance." Furthermore, on the afternoon of the 5th, the day of the National Government's return to the capital, Chairman Chiang personally went to the Central Broadcasting Station at 8:00 PM to broadcast the address he delivered at the capital's celebration of the return to the capital that morning to the soldiers, civilians, and compatriots across the nation to inspire them.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Hankou, 5th Dispatch] All students of various levels of schools in Wuhan, due to the stubbornness and unyieldingness of the Communist army, have recently published a letter to Chairman Chiang, urging him to make a decisive decision to suppress internal turmoil.</p>
<h3 id="e6">Citizens of the Capital Present a Brocade Banner and a Volume of Odes Welcoming the Return of the National Government <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 5th Dispatch] After the capital's celebration of the return to the capital on the 5th, the citizens presented Chairman Chiang with a brocade banner and a volume of odes respectfully welcoming the return of the National Government. According to the item's odes, it was drafted by Lu Jiye and inscribed by Huang Zhen. The full text is as follows: "On May 5, 35th year of the Republic of China, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek of the National Government triumphantly returns to the capital. The spirits and wind and rain carry the Mao Jie eastward, the scholars and women of the capital await the westward arrival of the imperial carriage. We dance and sing, praising him. The key to the northern gate was destroyed in ordinary times, the beacon smoke of the southern country was set off at dawn and dusk. The Japanese warlords harbored evil intentions and accumulated plans for piecemeal encroachment, trying to indulge in whale-like annexation. Our Chairman, in a sudden rage, followed the wind, through hundreds of battles, finally thwarted their edge. The foundation of the country is forever solid, the glory of the nation is far-reaching. Turning the universe around, rebuilding China, enemies and external troubles are endless in history. Many examples of Southern Expeditions and Northern Expeditions have been set before. However, making the strong surrender and willingly prostrate themselves, avenging nine generations of hatred with eight years of effort, is truly rare in ancient times as it is today. Chairman's Qianmo is unique, and the Miao calculation is flawless. In addition to continuing efforts, the plans from the east to the west were determined, and finally our rivers and mountains were returned, and the sun and moon were restored. This is unprecedented since the birth of the people. The central government in Bashu, looking east at the mountains and rivers, is lost in the sea, and returning west to the clouds and trees, is separated by wind and smoke. Our scholars and people in the southeast, responding to Chairman's appeal, worry about the rise and fall of the world, and have no regrets after nine deaths. Ten thousand families endure the pain. Although they have been poisoned by tea, they are still loyal. Fortunately, the rocks and borders of the four seas finally returned to the territory. The elders of Sanwu restored our clothes. Seeing that the War of Resistance has been won, we look forward to the inevitable success of nation-building. Although the northern lands still yearn for the banners, we believe that these people will surely ascend the mats together. We will see that Anle is strong and solid, safer than golden soup, and blessings, longevity, health, and peace are stronger than pine and cypress. Who sings the ode to the return to the capital, borrowing the sincerity of expressing virtue."</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 5th Dispatch] The most lively program in the celebration of the return to the capital, the "May 5th Tea Party," was held in the National Government Auditorium at 4:30 PM. Ambassadors from various countries, heads of various ministries and commissions, members of the Central Committee, and senators all received invitations jointly signed by the Chairman and his wife. Each guest was given a round red guest pass. Mr. and Mrs. Marshall arrived at 4:20 PM. Marshal was full of joy and very interested in the magnificent architecture of the National Government. Before signing his name, he and his wife looked around the corridor with red pillars in front of the auditorium, laughing constantly. Marshal was wearing a grass-green wool military uniform, and his wife was wearing a light brown Western suit with light yellow leather shoes and a tea flower of red and yellow colors on her hat. Soviet Ambassador Petrov and his wife arrived early. The guests shook hands and chatted in the lounge and corridor. At that time, a certain gentleman from the Chairman's office, who was familiar with the reporter, told the reporter that the Chairman wanted to browse the Shanghai newspapers, and the reporter handed over a copy of the Shenbao in his bag to be forwarded to the Chairman. This was the first Shanghai newspaper that the Chairman read on the day of the grand ceremony of returning to the capital. At 4:30 PM, the Chairman and his wife stepped out of the lounge and entered the auditorium amidst military music. The guests followed in a single file.

<p>[Our Newspaper, Guangzhou, 5th Dispatch] Zhang Fakui, Director of the Guangzhou Headquarters, held a cocktail party at the Headquarters' official residence yesterday (the 4th) to entertain reporters and report on the recent and future work of the Headquarters.</p>
<p>Severe Food Shortage</p>
<p>Director Zhang first reported on the current serious food shortage in Guangdong Province, saying in brief: "The current food shortage is actually even more severe than in 1942. However, in the past, the military food burden was too heavy, which affected the lack of civilian food. Therefore, before April 1, all Japanese prisoners, Japanese residents, and Korean residents were transported away. Now the military food has been reduced from 130,000 large packages to 6,500 large packages. Reducing military food can increase civilian food."</p>
<p>Communist Army in Dongjiang</p>
<p>Next, he talked about the withdrawal of the Dongjiang Communist armed personnel. He had consulted with the representatives of the Communist Party of China in accordance with the three principles instructed by the Chairman and provided all assistance to them, sparing no effort to compromise in order to achieve peaceful unification. The Communist side has raised various trivial issues and has not yet agreed to leave. Now the American representatives are very frustrated, so he personally hopes that the Communist side can clearly express what they want.</p>
<p>Northeast Issue</p>
<p>Director Zhang also expressed his thoughts on the Northeast issue, saying: "The Northeast issue is no longer a problem between the government and the Communist Party of China, but an international issue. The Soviet army must wait for the Communist army to arrive before withdrawing from a place, and the Communist Party of China is strongly opposed to the United States assisting the National Army in transporting north. In fact, the National Army taking over the Northeast is a matter of course. The Communist Party of China's opposition is nothing more than trying to make the Northeast special and make it a fait accompli. Therefore, the Northeast may evolve into a second 'Manchukuo' in the future. This is a matter of national sovereignty, and we must not ignore it."</p>
<p>Army Reorganization</p>
<p>Director Zhang also talked about the Headquarters' work on army reorganization, which is being actively carried out. It has now been decided to start the reorganization from the 10th of this month and complete it by the end of June. It will first change the army into a division and then reduce the division to two brigades. It can be reduced by more than two-thirds before November. It can be seen that the government's implementation of military and political orders will have factual evidence. However, it is unknown whether the Communist Party will comply with the agreement to reduce the army, because there is no news of army reduction in the Communist Party's newspapers.</p>
<p>Future Work</p>
<p>Finally, Director Zhang reported on the future work of the Headquarters, saying: "The first is the reorganization and training of the army in the jurisdiction, the second is to supervise the local government to thoroughly purify history and governance, eliminate corruption, and do its best to relieve all the suffering of the people. I hope that the media will also take the responsibility of supervision."</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Hankou, 5th Dispatch] Xu Yongchang, Zhou Enlai, and Bedell Smith, the US representative, arrived in Hankou from Beijing and Beiping at noon on the 5th and were entertained by Director Cheng Qian at a banquet in the evening and held talks. It is reported that the three will go to Xuanhuadian on the 6th to inspect. Zheng Shaowen, the representative of the Communist Party of China in Hankou, hosted the Wuhan Executive Group on the evening of the 5th.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 5th Dispatch] Xu Yongchang, the government representative of the three-person group, Zhou Enlai, the representative of the Communist Party of China, and Lu Tongsheng, the staff officer of the Communist Army, and Zhang Wenda, the translator, flew to Hankou by plane at 10:00 AM on the 5th. It is reported that they will meet with General Bedell Smith, the US representative, to investigate the actual situation in the conflict area in central Hubei around Xuanhuadian in order to mediate. Currently, both the government and the Communist Party of China claim that there are only small conflicts in central Hubei and no large-scale battles.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Beiping, 5th Dispatch] Brigadier General Bedell Smith, the head of the Executive Group of the Military Mediation Department, was urgently summoned by Envoy Marshall and flew to Hankou by plane on the morning of the 5th with two officials from the Reporting Headquarters and several representatives of the Executive Group.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Hankou, 5th Dispatch] Zheng Shaowen, a senior staff officer of the Central Plains Military Region of the Communist Party of China, hosted a reception for reporters in Wuhan last night in the name of the spokesperson of the Communist Party of China in Hankou and made a speech, the general meaning of which was the same as that of the speech made by Lu Dingyi, the representative of the Communist Party of China, in Chongqing. He was eager to list the numbers of the National Army surrounding the Communist Army area of Xuanhuadian, in order to strengthen the seriousness of the conflict in northern Hubei, but after repeated calculations, he was unable to reach the number he claimed of "ten armies and twenty-six divisions." Even as he described, there was still a shortage of at least one army and two divisions. When the questioner asked, he could not explain himself, so he claimed: "There is another army number that has not yet received a formal report." A reporter then asked: "Is it a slight exaggeration that you are referring to ten armies and 200,000 people?" Zheng replied: "I also wish it were a real exaggeration, and I hope that this exaggeration will lead to peace." The whole place burst into laughter. Finally, Zheng listed the conflict locations in northern Hubei, elaborated on the strategic value of various places, and said in a stirring tone: "We certainly hope for peace, but we cannot put down our weapons. We have now decided to resolutely 'resist'." Between the lines, there was a lot of gunpowder. The locals and the public believe that this kind of exaggerated propaganda by the Communist Party of China is a consistent trick, obviously trying to undermine the ceasefire agreement to cover up the current military operations. Furthermore, the Wuhan Executive Group is scheduled to hold a meeting on the 6th to discuss mediation steps.</p>

<h3 id="e16">Looking at the World and China from the Perspective of Agriculture <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>— Cheng Zhaoxiong</p>
<p>(I)</p>
<p>Generally, people's current understanding of world problems mostly focuses on economics, believing that the origins and trajectories of global issues can only be understood through the lens of economics. Both capitalism and socialism are products of economics, beginning and ending with it. Furthermore, large-scale, concentrated machine production is the defining economic characteristic of this era, simultaneously creating the diverse and complex nature of the modern world.</p>
<p>However, the solution to current global problems cannot disregard human nature. Social reform must involve institutional reform, which ultimately requires reform of human values. This so-called reform of human nature is, in fact, its revival. Only with the revival of human nature can there be spiritual awakening.</p>
<p>Who doesn't know that the current world is a material world? But when you affirm this material world, you must imbue it with spiritual meaning! This is what is meant by spiritual awakening.</p>
<p>Let cities become ruralized, and at the same time, let agriculture become industrialized. Ultimately, let everything possess the essence of the soil. In this way, one world after another will transform the world. Spiritual awakening and the revival of human nature are a new and good demand.</p>
<p>World problems are very complex, and Chinese problems are even more so. To understand Chinese problems, one should particularly focus on history and culture. The reason is simple: everyone knows that China is a nation with a unique history and culture.</p>
<p>China's success in becoming the China it is today relies on four conditions: first, Asia's unique geographical environment; second, agriculture; third, Chinese characters; and fourth, Confucianism. "Treat China as one person, and the world as one family"—even today, we cannot escape this harmful Confucian doctrine. "Understanding both internal and external principles, one can act appropriately according to the times"—Confucianism has always been useful to China and the world in imbuing material things with spiritual meaning. Focusing on culture should mean focusing on this.</p>
<p>Looking back, everyone knows that China's history is long and rich. But what about looking forward? Who can say it isn't also distant and vast? Focusing on history truly means nurturing idealism from history. We must promote idealism. China, at present, should be in a great era of idealism and should not be bogged down in shallow realism!</p>
<p>Speaking of solving Chinese problems, naturally we must focus on production in terms of economics. Production, scientific production, machine production—this is clearly the primary need in China.</p>
<p>Everyone says we need modernization; that's absolutely right. We need modernization; we desperately need modernization. Socially meaningful industrialization is truly a life-saving remedy for China, which has been groaning under the iron heel of capitalism for over a century. This means that China's modernization is the way for China to save and sustain itself, to renew and regenerate itself.</p>
<p>However, viewed from China's unique history and culture, China has a historical mission and a cultural mission. The historical mission is the ultimate realization of the idealism nurtured from Chinese history. The cultural mission is to imbue material things with spiritual meaning, or simply put, to infuse "matter" with "spirit." Tao Yuanming's poem reads: "The meaning of justice has left me for a long time, and few in the world seek truth; the eager old man of Lu, is trying to mend it and keep it pure." In this sense, we not only need modernization but also ultra-modernization, which is to surpass the West.</p>
<p>Industrialization, the decentralization of industry, the transplantation of industry into the countryside, and agriculture—industrialization, as well as garden cities, etc.—this is a series of ideals for us. If we can realize all of these things in reality, then this is ultra-modernization! Only in this way can we avoid being swallowed up by those rooted in nomadic peoples and perfected by industrial nations!</p>
<p>The atomic bomb has forced every country's defense plans and every country's production plans to undergo thorough changes! All our previous plans should also be revised!</p>
<p>The Chinese farmer problem, caused by the destruction of agriculture and the abuse of farmers, is the first problem we must solve. There are no more pitiable or admirable people in the world than Chinese farmers! When Mr. Gandhi fasted, the whole world paid great attention and extended great sympathy. But currently, in China, there must already be countless people who have long been like Gandhi! In this sense, we need modernization even more, and we need ultra-modernization even more.</p>
<p>In the sense of modernization, we need democracy, we need United Nations institutions, and we need an "ethical" society. But in the sense of ultra-modernization, I might as well say, we need centripetal democracy, cultural harmony, and an "ethical" society. Administration should be efficient and technical; life should be emotional and pastoral; scholarship should be humane and spiritual. We must oppose all political separatism, diplomatic dependency, and shallow utilitarianism!</p>
<p>What are we basing all this on? It is because we do not want to pursue the shadow of modern culture, nor do we want to be fascinated by the superficial beauty of modern civilization. We want industry, and we also want the industrialization of agriculture. We are people of a great era, and we must have new and good aspirations.</p>
<p>(II)</p>
<p>Currently, World War II has ended, the United Nations has triumphed, and we have also triumphed. But what happens after victory? Could victory be frightening?</p>
<p>The famous British general, the Duke of Wellington, after his great victory at the Battle of Waterloo, said:</p>
<p>"Except for a bad harvest, I know nothing more dreadful than a victory!"</p>
<p>But despite this, we continued our celebrations, constantly celebrating. We clearly know that things are different now. When things reach their limit, they change; when they change, they flow. Now, we should change and flow. The East is agricultural, and the East is also wise. Now, the world's eyes are fixed on the East, just as our eyes are fixed on the West. The East and the West will eventually be connected. Currently, the primary meaning of the West is the garden city, while we should be industrial villages. Otherwise, the destructive power of the atomic bomb will continue to develop without end, and it will be difficult to say what comes after victory.</p>
<p>We should always be clear that our future efforts cannot be separated from the path of "living simply, thinking brilliantly." Some unnecessary decadent living and some unnecessary empty thoughts should truly "go there, go there!" as Pushkin's poem says. Here, I would like to see rural development, globally oriented rural development, become a guarantee of victory in this war. And I feel that this is a good ending for good people!</p>
<p>Our ancestors once had a set of ideals and a set of methods that made China the only major power in Asia and also the only ancient nation remaining in the world. What were these ideals and methods? This is what is called "soldiers in agriculture."</p>
<p>But at present, this is no longer enough. We should add "learning in agriculture" and "industry in agriculture." We want to rely on a new scientific and industrialized agriculture to establish our agricultural tactics and agricultural defense in the atomic age.</p>
<p>The science of agriculture is the science of biology and the science of life.</p>
<p>The enterprise of agriculture is a peaceful enterprise and also a defensive enterprise.</p>
<p>If, from today onward, the world of humanity before was the world of physics and the world of war, then from now on, it should be the world of biology and life and the world of peace and defense.</p>
<p>Now the achievements of physical science have reached the stage of atomic energy, but the achievements of biological science have not yet allowed people to understand the ultimate realization of biology and the essence of life. Therefore, people's destruction of biology and life itself is more than enough, while their grasp of biology and life is insufficient. However, based on the achievements of physical science, it is imaginable that biological science will also make rapid progress in the future. The invention of the atomic bomb will be the intersection of the world of physics and the world of biology. Frankly speaking, the world cannot but change from now on.</p>
<p>Logically, the world from now on should be a world of peace. However, if you are overly optimistic, you may be wrong again. Because peace was once a beautiful legend, and today it is still just a clever plan! But, in any case, the world from now on will certainly be a world of defense.</p>
<p>In the world of biological science and the world of defense, current tactics and national defense must change. The basis of tactics and national defense is nothing more than the scale of production. Generally speaking, the larger the scale, the better. However, the large-scale, concentrated industrial production that people are currently attempting only provides a good target for atomic bombs from the perspective of war, and it is not necessarily very economical from the perspective of economics. The automobile magnate Henry Ford, one of the greatest industrialists in the modern world, once said: "Conventionally speaking, the establishment of a large factory is not economical," "Large-scale operations must be decentralized throughout the country to regularly seek to serve the public. This is not only to obtain the lowest cost but also for the sake of purchasing among the masses of producers."</p>
<p>However, the largest scale of production and operation can be formed in other ways. A famous French economist, Dupluois, once said: "Even the largest industrial organization can be composed of several independent, autonomous small organizations."</p>
<p>Based on the existing achievements of physical science, coupled with the possible achievements of biological science in the future, I believe that the industrialized scale of agricultural production will form a greater and better force than the current industrial power. With this greater and better force, we are qualified to appreciate a biological world, that is, a living world, a world "full of the movement of thunder and rain," a rich world that will not be poor, a world of lasting joy and eternal health!</p>
<p>Confucius said, "I want to remain silent," and also said, "What does Heaven say? The four seasons proceed, and the myriad things are born. What does Heaven say?" This world of "the four seasons proceeding and the myriad things being born" is forever illuminated by the sun, moon, and stars. Even if the sky is sometimes dim and the earth is sometimes dark, it will ultimately not detract from a kind of eternal light.</p>
<p>Life is not a machine. Saying that life is a machine is a misconception of modern humanity, an unfortunate misconception! Life is a "flow"—"Like this flow, never ceasing day and night!" This is most clearly seen in garden cities and industrial villages, in the world of gardens.</p>
<p>In agriculture and in the industrialization of agriculture, people will at least have one benefit, which is not losing life. We now need the science of life, and we now need the education of life even more!</p>
<p>We want industry, and we also want agriculture, the industrialization of agriculture, and garden cities.</p>
<p>"Clear skies and peaceful earth, a peaceful mind and righteous principles!" This will not be the sole achievement of modern industry; it will be the possible achievement of the industrialization of agriculture in the future, and the achievement of garden cities.</p>
<p>(III)</p>
<p>In the current world, we clearly know that we cannot be simple; if we are simple, we will live very difficult lives. But despite this, we must ultimately simplify; we must transform complexity into simplicity, using simplicity to manage complexity. We want material things, and we also want to imbue material things with spiritual meaning. We want speed, and we want progress; industry is the product of progress. But we also want stability in progress. Therefore, we want industry, and we also want agriculture, and we also want the industrialization of agriculture.</p>
<p>Looking at the world from the perspective of agriculture, I believe: (1) The origin of human disasters lies in the destruction of agriculture and the abuse of farmers; this is especially true in China! (2) Humans are historical and cultural animals, ethnic and international issues are historical and cultural issues, and farmers are the creators of history, while agriculture is the nourisher of culture.</p>
<p>(3) The world should become a garden, not just a factory. People should use machines to benefit them, and they should not become machines themselves and be used by machines.</p>
<p>(4) To understand world problems, we must focus on economics, but to solve world problems, we cannot but focus on human nature. We must promote the revival of human nature, and we must promote spiritual awakening.</p>
<p>(5) To understand Chinese problems, we should especially focus on history and culture; to solve Chinese problems, we should focus on production. At the same time, the farmer problem is China's first problem.</p>
<p>(6) In the above sense, undoubtedly, we need modernization, and we also need ultra-modernization. Only with modernization can China resist a new human disaster; only with ultra-modernization can China save a new human disaster.</p>
<p>(7) In the sense of ultra-modernization, we certainly need democracy, United Nations institutions, and an ethical society. We even more need centripetal democracy, cultural harmony, and an ethical society.</p>
<p>(8) The primary meaning of the West is the garden city, while we are industrial villages. Rural development should be the good ending for good people.</p>
<p>(9) The science of agriculture is the science of biology and the science of life. The world should be a biological, living world. In this world, our national defense and our tactics should be brand new!</p>
<p>(10) The achievements of agricultural science and agricultural education will ultimately determine the future of humanity because the future will be a garden city and a realm of agricultural industrialization!</p>
<p>In the aftermath of another world catastrophe and great human sacrifice, a pre-dawn pain is still haunting our hearts. For the future of humanity, everyone must look squarely at the current world. Like what has been said above, we are implicitly continuing a unique historical and cultural tradition. We want to connect to something, then establish something, and then actually do something. In the eyes of countless people today, this may not seem new, but it is ultimately true and can benefit people. At the same time, how can we ignore the exchange of human history and culture? Our overall goal as human beings is the "continuation" of historical culture, but this "continuation" can only be sought in "tradition" and "exchange." I look at the world from the perspective of history and culture, and I know that industry has its future, and agriculture has its prospects. It is from these prospects of agriculture that we can more easily see ourselves and our world!</p>
<h3 id="e17">Sing, Nanjing! <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent for this Newspaper, Yue Haosheng</p>
<p>Ten thousand kinds of colors could not record the grandeur of the National Government's return to the capital.</p>
<p>Ten thousand kinds of colors cannot fully depict this unprecedented joy; ten thousand kinds of sounds cannot fully express the laughter filling the sky. May 5th, the thirty-fifth year of the Republic of China, is a day of double celebration, a glorious historical festival. The entire city of Nanjing is bathed in revelry, and all of Nanjing is immersed in incessant singing.</p>
<p>On the morning of May 4th, when I stepped off the first train from Shanghai to Nanjing, I was so moved by the fervent preparations underway for the return to the capital that I immediately plunged into a state of extreme excitement. Without a moment to breathe, I rushed to the Central Propaganda Department building, squeezed in with colleagues from all over the country, and collected my reporter's pass for the next day's ceremony. The two colors, light red and deep red, both represented joy, but everyone scrambled for the deep red one, because it was for photographers, allowing them to get closer to the center of the ceremony. After spending four hours completing the procedures, I began to survey Nanjing on the eve of the Return to Capital Ceremony amidst the neon-lit night market, bathed in a red glow.</p>
<p>Crowds surged along the streets like tides, everyone spending the evening with the same quick, cheerful steps and happy mood. Young people were like those on the eve of their wedding, children like those on the eve of the New Year, and the elderly were even more excited, for the greatest joy of their lives was about to arrive.</p>
<p>Every Street Aglow with Red</p>
<p>On every major street, huge banners as long as the roads themselves, reading "Welcome the National Government's Return to the Capital" and "Welcome Chairman Chiang's Victorious Return," had been hung high. The two newly constructed giant paifang (ornamental archways) on Guofu Road looked even more magnificent under the illumination of the lights and the backdrop of the night. They were entirely three-dimensional, a fusion of Chinese and Western architectural styles. Four vermilion pillars supported exquisitely painted archways. On both sides of the triumphal arch-style pillars, five brightly colored national flags and party flags stood firm. At the top of the arch, four massive and heavy golden characters on a red background read "Celebrate the Return to the Capital," shimmering in the light, a scene of pure red.</p>
<p>The National Government Like a Novel Constellation</p>
<p>Standing in front of the National Government Building, looking up at its main gate, a long string of electric lights was strung from the top of the sky-piercing flagpole to both sides of the gate. Against the backdrop of the night sky, it looked like a novel constellation from afar, or a long curtain woven with stars. Holding my newly obtained press pass, I negotiated with the guards at the gate to enter and see the night view inside the National Government.</p>
<p>Stepping through the gate of the National Government, one enters a cement square, with a straight road leading directly to the last building. Countless national flags and party flags were erected around the gardens on both sides of the road, surrounded by a ring of colorful floral borders, a truly beautiful scene.</p>
<p>Vermilion Pillars Standing in the Courtyard</p>
<p>Following this road straight ahead, the first section is a high-ceilinged courtyard with six rows of thirty vermilion pillars standing in the middle. Further in, the interior is completely painted green, with a marble-colored carpet with red edges running straight from here to the courtyard in front of the Chairman's office building. Under the lights, it looks like a long, winding dragon, infinitely meandering, infinitely far. Turning a corner from the third door, you can enter the auditorium. Candle-shaped electric lights illuminate the auditorium brightly, and the mercury lamps of the Central Film Studio were already arranged in place. Returning to the original road and passing through another courtyard, you reach the Chairman's office building. A guard standing on the porch came up to question me. After I explained my purpose again, he allowed me to go up, and the lights on the corridors were already on.</p>
<p>In the Chairman's Office Building</p>
<p>I carefully inspected every room. The first room on the left on the second floor is the Chairman's office. The glass door was tightly locked, and a wooden sign with the key number "Second Floor, Number 13" hung on the doorknob. The second room next door is the Chairman's reception room, and diagonally opposite is the Chief Secretary's office. The conference room on the third floor has a mountain-shaped conference table, coffee-colored leather chairs. The room is quiet, and the electric fans and lotus-shaped chandeliers on the ceiling seem to be waiting for their master to "turn them on." Surrounding the conference room are the committee members' lounges. The fourth floor houses the radio archives, etc. Standing on the top floor balcony, overlooking the entire National Government, all lit up. Except for encountering the guards and workers rushing to arrange things at night, everything was quiet, and the croaking of frogs from the surrounding gardens could be heard very clearly. The night breeze carried the faint fragrance of the garden. I lingered in the Chairman's office building, the friction of my leather shoes against the carpet being the loudest sound. Coming down from the balcony, I went to the door of the Chairman's office again. Someone opened and closed the green screen door. I stroked the glowing copper handrail, filled with solemn emotion and infinite reverent imagination. This shining doorknob is the very place connected to millions of hearts!</p>
<p>The Command Center for Peace and National Reconstruction</p>
<p>On the eve of this Return to Capital Ceremony, I alone came late at night to see this National Government, symbolizing infinite glory. Tomorrow, this building will begin to serve as the highest command center for peace and national reconstruction, and will also become the place to which people all over the world "yearn to go." At the gate, I chatted with the guards. He had returned to Nanjing last December, and had worked in the guard team before the war. When I asked about the Return to Capital Ceremony the next day, he could not suppress the joy on his face, even while standing at attention in a solemn manner.</p>
<p>A Story of Children at a Friend's Home</p>
<p>Leaving the National Government and going to a friend's house, I was even more moved by the joyful atmosphere permeating the family. The mother was taking out the most colorful and beautiful clothes from the wardrobe for the child, and the child was jumping around, unwilling to sleep. He circled around his great-grandfather's knees, constantly asking about the stories of "tomorrow." This child, who was only seven years old and grew up during the war, was returning to Nanjing for the first time and loved hearing stories about Nanjing. When his great-grandfather began to tell him about the fall of Nanjing, he leaned against his great-grandfather's knees, listening intently with wide eyes. Finally, his great-grandfather hugged him in his arms and told him, "Child! Always remember to love China! Love Nanjing!" The great-grandfather's voice trembled slightly, and tears glistened in the child's moved eyes.</p>
<p>I walked back to the street, which was now decorated with floral clusters everywhere. All the light and color were used to depict the four characters "Celebrate the Return to the Capital." May 4th was a day without night, with millions of people using their eager work and limitless excitement to welcome the dawn.</p>
<p>Zhang Qun, acting director of the Chongqing Military Headquarters, took office on the 2nd of this month, with Xu Yongchang, Minister of Military Affairs, representing Chairman Chiang in presenting the seal of office.</p>
<p>The citizens of Shenyang held a grand meeting to welcome the National Army's entry into the city, an unprecedented event in the fourteen years since the Northeast fell. The picture shows the parade after the meeting, with General Xiong Shihui, Director of the Northeast Headquarters, in the upper right corner.</p>
<h3 id="e18">Solemn Holy Ground · Solemn Grand Ceremony — Opened by the Sun Itself <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>Today, the cheers of these millions of people wash away the shame suffered for eight years!</p>
<p>After days of rain, the sun on the morning of the 5th appeared specifically for this unprecedented grand ceremony. Although dawn came early, cars and trucks of all sizes, covered in slogans, had already begun to shuttle back and forth on the streets, all kinds of vehicles rushing towards Zhongshan Gate, towards the direction of the rising sun.</p>
<p>On the asphalt road outside Guanghua Gate, lined with dense shade trees, looking towards Zhongshan Mausoleum, a wisp of ethereal morning mist enveloped the mausoleum. The sun rose higher and higher, and the mist faded more and more. This solemn holy ground, this solemn grand ceremony, was to be opened by the sun itself.</p>
<p>Arriving at the Snow-White, Glorious Mausoleum</p>
<p>Arriving, arriving, the mausoleum, infinitely verdant in the morning sun, shining with a snow-white radiance, had arrived. Getting out of the car in the square in front of the gate, looking up at Zijin Mountain, the steps of the mausoleum looked like a high ladder that could lead directly to the blue sky. On the high poles on both sides, the national flags and party flags fluttered in the morning sun and morning breeze. Taking steps full of solemnity and infinite joy, climbing up step by step, everyone's faces were full of smiles. Even if they did not know each other, everyone greeted each other with smiles.</p>
<p>Civil and Military Officials Gathered One After Another</p>
<p>In the square in front of the memorial hall, civil and military officials, senators, and national representatives gathered, shaking hands, greeting each other, and asking, "When did you arrive in Nanjing?" Military officials were on the left, all wearing new-style army uniforms, their stars gleaming; civil officials were on the right, wearing suits and long robes, their styles varied. On the civil officials' side, the Central Executive and Supervisory Committee members were in the front, with senators and national representatives in the back. Standing committee members wore special red stripes. They were allowed in the memorial hall. News reporters were arranged on both sides outside the gate of the memorial hall.</p>
<p>President Sun and his eldest son were asked by photographers to gather in front of the statue of the Father of the Nation for group photos. President Song, wearing a blue Zhongshan suit, constantly shook hands with everyone. He Yingqin and Chen Cheng came from the left, everyone ____. When Wu Tiecheng walked out of the auditorium again to greet them, everyone knew that the Chairman was about to arrive. A round of applause rang out, and Chairman and his wife walked up from the central traffic road.</p>
<p>Chairman Wearing Five Grand Medals</p>
<p>The Chairman wore a new-style khaki army uniform with five grand medals on his chest. The Madame wore a dark woolen coat and a dark blue cheongsam with purple morning glories. She wore a medal of honor on her left lapel, and a badge of the Aviation Committee. The Madame was on the left, and the Chairman was on the right, and they walked into the memorial hall.</p>
<p>The ceremony began, and the sound of the salute echoed with earth-shattering rhythm. The ceremony proceeded amidst the salute, playing music, and offering flowers. Zhang Daofan read the eulogy, and airplanes scattered leaflets in the low sky. Inside the memorial hall, lights flashed, and after the ceremony was completed, the Chairman led everyone around to pay their respects. After a quarter of an hour, they walked out of the memorial hall with heavy steps and stood on the steps in the sunlight to deliver a speech. The speech was written in large characters on a stack of memo papers, short and forceful, and often interrupted by enthusiastic applause. After finishing the speech, the ceremony ended. The Chairman and his wife walked down the steps, and the crowd embraced and walked along. Applause and shouts of "Long Live the Chairman!" rose and fell, continuously. A section of the cane, looking around, shining a healthy red in the sun, the Chairman's health, is the joy of all Chinese people!</p>
<p>The Father of the Nation Knows and Smiles in Joy</p>
<p>Boy Scouts on both sides jumped and cheered, and the Madame waved a four-colored handkerchief to greet the children. Chinese and foreign photographers rushed to the front, climbing high to capture this precious moment. Leaving the mausoleum! Before getting into the car, the Chairman stood in front of the car door, paying his respects to the top of the mountain and returning the salute to the crowd. Along with the light dust kicked up by the car, the cheers roared like thunder. Today, the cheers of these millions of people washed away the shame suffered by the mausoleum for eight years. The Father of the Nation, sleeping in Zijin Mountain, would know and smile wholeheartedly. On the streets of the city, crowds surged like tides, cheering towards the Chairman's car. Nanjing was submerged in songs of joy filling the sky!</p>
<h3 id="e19">At the Celebration Meeting <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Ming, This Newspaper's Correspondent in Nanjing</p>
<p>Every Chinese Son and Daughter Present Felt Comforted: The National Government Has Now Returned to Nanjing!</p>
<p>The procession of people and vehicles moved out of the mausoleum. People's emotions were excited. The boundless, sea-like sound was spreading. They were all striving for an opportunity to stand near Chairman and Madame, or even to take a step forward, because it was an honor.</p>
<p>This tide of people and vehicles surged on the wide asphalt road, neatly planted with poplars and locust trees on both sides. The particularly clear sunshine shone on everything. People's hearts turned towards the light!</p>
<p>Many magnificent celebratory paifang (archways) were erected at various important locations. The vermilion color that added to the Eastern tone was painted on the high beams and pillars, adding much admiration to our enthusiasm. When the archways fell behind, we reached our destination—the National Assembly Square. A grand popular meeting was about to begin here, and people were participating freely. There were representatives of institutions, individual citizens, and government officials.</p>
<p>The layout of the meeting place was very simple. The platform stood high at one end of the meeting place. Strangers were not allowed to go up here. Some beautiful fresh potted flowers were arranged on the platform. At the same time, a huge flag standing in the center was presented to the Chairman by all the citizens of Nanjing. The four large characters on it read: "勋彪京关" [Xūn biāo jīng guān, roughly translates to "Meritorious deeds illuminate Jinguan (Nanjing)"]. The golden characters were pasted on a red background.</p>
<p>Because crowds were constantly pouring in from the entrance, the commander had to shout at the top of his lungs, asking everyone to pay attention to order. The large group of reporters was not assigned to any particular section, so they were constantly receiving orders from the loudspeakers. For example, "Retreat to the right" or "Take another step back," but the reporters were ultimately waiting in the waves of people until Chairman arrived.</p>
<p>It was 10:25 when cheers like an explosion filled the space. Chairman walked to the edge of the platform, and people cheered with even more enthusiastic hope. Then, the Madame also stepped forward and stood at the edge of the platform. Just like that, a sea of sound continued. I personally saw a little girl who, in a very difficult situation, squeezed into the group of reporters and shouted, "Long Live Chairman Chiang!" Then, a very happy, intimate smile radiated on her face. Naturally, she felt that being so close to the Chairman, hearing her voice in person, she was a citizen, she had this hope, and she received the satisfaction she deserved.</p>
<p>Amid the cheers, the order of the meeting began; but until Chairman's speech began, the continuous sound of "Long Live the Chairman" could still be heard all around...</p>
<p>The Chairman's speech was very concise, very practical, and very moving. People deeply felt that Chairman was standing with us today, and was so intimately remembering the people at the foot of Zijin Mountain. The Chairman once traced the situation when he left Nanjing twenty-six years ago. Those dim memories further promoted the excitement and enthusiasm of today's return to the capital. At the same time, Chairman said, "Today we are still in Nanjing, seeing all our compatriots again, and we have won the victory, our unequal treaties have been abolished, all these are the results of the struggle of compatriots across the country. I am really moved." Putting all the credit on the compatriots, people listened with even more gratitude.</p>
<p>"From today on, we must avoid being massacred and insulted by others. We must be self-reliant and self-reliant. All compatriots must unite and struggle, and work together to increase the strength and status of the country." This was a reminder, and at the same time, Chairman encouraged all compatriots to eliminate waste, value diligence and thrift, observe discipline, and be responsible. Finally, he wished everyone good health. This scene of excitement beyond measure came to a conclusion here. People shouted madly again. The order of the meeting almost wavered, but there was no chaos. Today, the sky was clear, and Zijin Mountain existed brilliantly in golden tones. Flags with the Blue Sky, White Sun, and Red Earth flew everywhere. Every son and daughter of the Chinese nation should be proud: The National Government has returned to Nanjing!</p>
<h3 id="e20">Fragments of the Return to Capital Ceremony <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>— Mao Shukui, This Newspaper's Correspondent in Nanjing</p>
<p>Chairman and Madame</p>
<p>After Chairman Chiang's car arrived at the mausoleum, the organizing committee had prepared two sedan chairs. Chairman and his wife refused to sit and walked up to the memorial hall on foot, taking only 15 minutes and 20 seconds. Chairman's pace was steady, not breathless, not blushing, and everyone was happy for Chairman's health.</p>
<p>When Chairman Chiang gave a speech and saluted, Madame Chiang always stepped back one step, but when getting on and off the car and climbing the stone steps, the Madame was in front and Chairman was behind.</p>
<p>Chairman's speech draft consisted of nine pages with extra-large characters, probably because he was afraid he couldn't see clearly. After Chairman finished speaking, he handed it over to Yu Jishi for safekeeping.</p>
<p>Madame Chiang wore a black coat today, a high-necked long wool cheongsam with black background and purple flowers, black open-toed high-heeled shoes, and black earrings. The whole outfit was in plain colors, which made her look even more solemn.</p>
<p>Various Aspects of the Meeting Place</p>
<p>The organizing committee for the Return to Capital Ceremony worked all night yesterday, especially the transportation group, which was the busiest issuing temporary passes.</p>
<p>There were many types of attendance certificates for the meeting, some were long, some were flat, some were light red, and some were deep red. It didn't matter at all when participating, but it made a big difference when entering the memorial hall.</p>
<p>The youngest of the Boy Scouts maintaining order in the mausoleum was named Qi Yaxiong, only nine years old. Although he was small, his spirit was very good.</p>
<p>Civil and military officials in front of the Founder's Memorial Hall were divided into left and right sides. On the civil side, there were more than 2,000 central committee members, senators, national representatives, and senior civil officials from various ministries and departments. The first person in the first row was Zhang Mojun, a female central committee member; on the military side, there were more than 1,000 generals of the army, navy, and air force, with the lowest rank being major. The first person in the first row was General Huang Qixiang, and the second person was General Tang Shizun.</p>
<p>The Lieutenant General MC reported it like this: "Central committee members stand in the first row, and so on for dozens of rows."</p>
<p>All military officers wore their medals today, creating a medal exhibition and medal competition.</p>
<p>The characteristic of the meeting at the mausoleum in the morning was a lot of applause, while at the grand square, there was a lot of cheering. One used hands, and the other used mouths, which was quite interesting.</p>
<p>Character Portraits</p>
<p>Commander-in-Chief He Yingqin was covered with many medals, as many as twelve, making him a good target for photographers.</p>
<p>The two brothers Gu Zhenggang and Gu Zhengding, after climbing the stone steps of the mausoleum, met Liu Wendao. The three of them walked and talked, all happy that the mausoleum had not been damaged. When they reached another place, Gu Zhenggang suddenly stopped and smiled to his younger brother, saying, "One of the dings here is missing."</p>
<p>Shao Lizi wore a brand-new, tailor-made Zhongshan suit and walked hand-in-hand with Madame Shao, inseparable, looking very intimate.</p>
<p>Among the female central committee members, Shen Huishu was the fattest, and Tang Guobai was the tallest. When Shen arrived at the mausoleum, her face was covered with a very plain and beautiful gauze scarf. But she said, "I'm not doing it for beauty."</p>
<p>Wang Xiaoxu, president of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, was blocked by the military police at the entrance when the mass celebration meeting was over, and the crowd behind him was still surging like a tide. President Wang was attacked from both sides and shouted "Get out of the way" "Get out of the way." Fortunately, a major general-level officer passed by and was able to rescue him.</p>
<p>Before the ceremony, reporters obtained information from news figures, among which Wu Guozhen was surrounded for the longest time. Wu wore a long robe and mandarin jacket today, but he was smiling with all his heart today, so although he was solemn, he was still amiable.</p>
<p>Car Exhibition</p>
<p>There were as many as thousands of cars parked next to the mausoleum, some were the oldest, and some were the newest, like a long snake. It can be said that they are the collection of all the cars in Nanjing, a magnificent sight.</p>
<p>Early this morning, cars were driving on the road of the mausoleum. According to the guards of the mausoleum, the first car to arrive at the mausoleum was the reporter's car of a certain newspaper, at 5:40.</p>
<p>Chinese and Foreign Reporters</p>
<p>More than 160 reporters participated in the Return to Capital Ceremony, including newspapers from all over the country. Among them was an old reporter from Henan Qingbai Newspaper, who was 60 years old. His white beard was fluttering, which attracted the attention of his peers.</p>
<p>When the ceremony was about to begin, the foreign reporter team swarmed in, making a great show. The Chinese reporters, standing behind the military police, immediately perked up and were unwilling to fall behind, preparing to follow the team and enter, but the result: "They were also blocked."</p>
<p>For the sake of the ceremony, Chinese and foreign reporters gathered in the capital, some taking the night train from Shanghai, and some flying from Chongqing. It was truly "a gathering of officials" and "a sea of people."</p>
<p>In addition to eight Associated Press reporters and others participating in the interviews and photography, there were no other foreigners at the Return to Capital Ceremony at the mausoleum.</p>

<p>Internal Conflict Among Communist Troops in Northern Jiangsu: According to refugees from Xiangshuikou in Guanyun County: The newly reorganized Second Division of the Communist Army (formerly the Fourth Army of the puppet Second Front Army) has repeatedly clashed due to disobeying orders from the Communist Party's Yanzhao Military Region Command. Now, they have again disobeyed orders and marched north from Dongkan. The entire division, with approximately 10,000 men in three regiments, is stationed around Xiangshuikou. To prevent accidents, other Communist forces have deployed the Yanzhao Independent Brigade north of the Chao River in Xiangshuikou to block their advance, prohibiting all merchants from passing through. The two sides are on the verge of conflict, and the situation is quite serious.</p>

<p>Troops Demand Grain, Deadline Set for Allocation: Due to the urgent need for military grain in the county, the Provincial Field Grain Office specifically ordered County Magistrate Fang to allocate 200,000 city pounds of rice from the county's quota of 10,000 shi for the 49th Army to collect nearby. After receiving the order, County Magistrate Fang, considering that the county's military grain procurement had not yet begun and that the immediate supply of grain for the troops was impossible, convened an emergency meeting of the district offices on the 30th of last month. It was decided that before the military grain procurement, each district office would temporarily borrow grain by the deadlines of May 4th, 8th, 13th, and 18th.

<p>Enemy Translator Sentenced to Life Imprisonment: After Wuxing fell, the enemy's military police unit was established in the winter of the 26th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1937]. Huang Meisheng initially served as a translator, and after Huang took another position, Gong Lianbao succeeded him. He willingly collaborated with the enemy, oppressed the people, and harmed anti-Japanese personnel, which cannot be fully enumerated. After the victory, he was apprehended by the 49th Army of the National Army and transferred to the Wuxing Court. After investigation and prosecution by Chief Investigator Chen, he was handed over to the Wuxing Trial Division of the Zhejiang High Court for trial in accordance with the law.

<h3 id="e22">The Fate of All the People of India Hinges on It: Round Table Conference Opens Yesterday: Britain Suggests Establishing a Joint Government: Except for National Defense, Diplomacy, and Transportation, Regional Division Can Be Implemented <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] New Delhi, 5th Dispatch: The Simla Round Table Conference, concerning the fate of India's 400 million people, opened today, with twelve participants. The Congress Party representatives are Party Chairman Acharya Kripalani, Executive Committee members Nehru, Patel, and Ghaffar. The Muslim League representatives are Party Chairman Jinnah, Syed, Ismail, Mashtai, and three others. Gandhi is providing advice to the Indian people behind the scenes. After the opening, the main issue of Indian unity was immediately discussed. The British Cabinet delegation suggested establishing two separate governments, one for India and one for the Muslim community. Except for foreign policy and transportation, each could govern itself. Jinnah immediately opposed concentrating power in one government. The representatives resolved to meet twice daily and publish the results of the meeting daily.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Simla, 5th Dispatch] The British-Indian Round Table Conference began today at the Governor-General's residence to negotiate India's constitutional plan. The British representatives are Cabinet Ministers Lawrence, Cripps, and Alexander. This conference will not be very long but has extremely important and decisive significance. The British Cabinet representatives have proposed several suggestions: (1) Establish a joint government to control the national defense, diplomacy, and transportation of the entire country; (2) Provinces have various rights beyond the aforementioned stipulations, including delineating Muslim and non-Muslim areas according to the distribution of residents; (3) Indian states may also join after consulting with the joint government after an equal period. These suggestions are the starting point of the negotiations. However, the Congress Party and the Muslim League have both stated in advance that their participation in the meeting will not be bound by any restrictions and that they can resist, modify, or reject any disputed points. Observers predict that the mission of the British representatives is to find a compromise between the concessions that the Congress Party is willing to make and the minimum demands of the Muslim League. The first two or three days of the meeting are usually the most important.</p>

However, if one were to read the diary of his personal physician, such a notion would vanish. According to the diary, Hitler frequently received injections and swallowed vitamin pills. Due to his bad temper, he often suffered from stomach problems and was superstitious about the healing power of leeches. The diary also records that Hitler used hair oil on his left eye and other such "vulgar" behaviors. <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>Resolving World Problems Requires True Democracy – Speech by British Secretary of State</p>

Borders are not a guarantee of security; collective effort is essential to prevent aggression. Only collective peace can bring happiness to humanity. For the past six years, many believed that world problems could not be resolved without force. While force can defeat aggression, it cannot solve long-term problems. Such problems should be resolved through reason and agreement. Therefore, only true democracy can resolve world problems, and this is the goal we strive for.</p>

<p>\[Associated Press, Chicago, 5th\] The University of Chicago announced today that the world's first atomic "generator" has reached the blueprint design stage.

<p>Draft Constitution of the Fourth Republic – French Referendum to Be Held Again – If Rejected Again, a New Constitution Will Be Drafted – Foreign Ministers of Various Countries Pay Close Attention to This Matter</p>
<p>\[Reuters, Paris, 5th\] France is holding a referendum today to decide whether to adopt the new constitution. Some people rushed to the polling stations as early as 8:00 AM because today is Sunday, and they plan to go for a trip to the countryside after voting.</p>
<p>\[Associated Press, Paris, 5th\] The draft constitution of the French Fourth Republic, prepared by the French Constituent Assembly, is being submitted to a national referendum of 25 million citizens today. The Constituent Assembly is dominated by leftist parties. Judging from the current situation, the difference between the number of votes for and against is expected to be very small. This draft constitution adopts a unicameral system, stipulating that legislative, executive, and judicial powers are concentrated in one National Assembly. The Senate of the Third Republic has been abolished. The powers of the President are severely limited, and the Premier is produced by the National Assembly. The majority of judges of the Supreme Court and all thirty judges of the High Court are also elected by the Assembly. If the national referendum approves the draft constitution, a general election will be held on June 6 to elect official members of parliament. If it is rejected, a new Constituent Assembly will be elected in June to draft a new constitution. All French territories, except Vietnam, will participate in this referendum. Those who oppose this draft constitution claim that concentrating all powers in the Assembly will inevitably lead to a dictatorship by the majority party in the National Assembly, which is the Communist Party.</p>
<p>\[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 4th\] Well-informed sources here have said that foreign politicians and diplomats are gathering here, paying close attention to the French referendum to be held tomorrow to gauge public opinion on the draft constitution passed by the National Constituent Assembly. It is generally believed that the outcome of the referendum will determine what policies France will adopt within a year. For example, the attitude of the French representative at the Four Foreign Ministers Conference will be directly influenced by the composition of the cabinet. If the French people endorse this draft constitution in tomorrow's referendum, the question of whether Foreign Minister Bidault will resign will become an issue, and the foreign ministers of the UK, US, and Soviet Union will also question this. However, French officials say that the outcome of tomorrow's referendum will not affect the fate of the cabinet. Only after the general election in early June will the cabinet be reorganized. Therefore, external fears and the rumors of Bidault's resignation are unfounded.</p>

<p>Eisenhower Scheduled to Fly to Shanghai the Day After Tomorrow – States in the Philippines that the US Cannot Afford to Be Weak</p>
<p>\[Associated Press, Manila, 4th\] US Army Chief of Staff Dwight D. Eisenhower, after inspecting military facilities in the Manila area today, told reporters that the rapid demobilization of the US military is severely hindered by the need to maintain important military bases in the Pacific region. The US military strength in the Philippines depends on a political agreement between the United States and the Republic of the Philippines. Regarding the establishment of air bases, the United States hopes to reach an agreement with the Philippines. The newly elected President of the Philippines, Roxas, recently declared his guarantee of close cooperation with the United States in defense matters, which makes Eisenhower's statement significant. According to Washington sources, the former Philippine Army Chief of Staff and current head of the Philippine Military Mission to the United States, Valdes, stated, "I 100% agree with Roxas's policies and Eisenhower's hope to establish air bases in the Philippines." Eisenhower continued, "Existing equipment worth millions of dollars needs to be taken care of, but no one is paying attention to it." While Eisenhower could not specify the minimum number of divisions needed in the Pacific region, he said, "I would like history to prove that we can never afford to be weak." Eisenhower is scheduled to fly to Shanghai on the 8th of this month, and then proceed to Korea and Japan.</p>
<p>\[Associated Press, Washington, 5th\] On the 8th of this month, the anniversary of the victory in Europe in this great war, General Eisenhower issued a message stating, "The nations have not yet fulfilled their obligation to those who achieved victory until a lasting world peace is established." Secretary of War Patterson also issued a message, echoing Eisenhower's praise for the achievements of the armed forces.</p>

<p>Foreign Ministers of Four Powers Attempt to Break Impasse – The Key Lies in Different Basic Policies – The Resolution of the Italian-Yugoslavian Border Issue Is the Most Difficult</p>
<p>\[This Newspaper's Report\] London, 5th (Radio Broadcast): The Foreign Ministers of the Four Powers today renewed their efforts to break the impasse over the Italian-Yugoslavian border issue. A BBC correspondent in Paris reported that the "disagreements" among the Four Foreign Ministers are extremely deep, and the key lies in the different basic policies of the Four Powers. After many days of discussion, no progress has been made, and the only achievement is the agreement reached at the previous London conference. The Foreign Ministers of the UK, US, and France believe that Italy and other Axis countries should not be placed in a desperate situation, but the Soviet side does not share this view.</p>
<p>\[This Newspaper's Report\] London, 5th (Radio Broadcast): The informal meeting of the Foreign Ministers of the Four Powers, originally scheduled for 4:00 PM today, was postponed at the last minute. At the request of US Secretary of State Byrnes, it was rescheduled for 11:00 AM tomorrow.</p>
<p>\[Reuters, Paris, 5th\] The Foreign Ministers of the Four Powers discussed the border issue between Italy and Yugoslavia for five hours yesterday but still failed to reach a resolution. Byrnes proposed holding a referendum under Allied supervision between the borders proposed by the US and the Soviet Union, so that local residents could decide for themselves whether they wished to be governed by Italy or Yugoslavia. The Border Demarcation Team, composed of representatives from the Four Powers, proposed four different demarcation plans. The Yugoslav representative, Kardelj, stated yesterday that the demarcation plans proposed by the UK, US, and France are unacceptable to the Yugoslav government. The new border proposed by the Yugoslav government is still west of the line proposed by the Soviet Union. At the meeting yesterday morning, Molotov supported the Yugoslav proposal, Bevin stated that the border line proposed by the UK was the most appropriate, and the border line proposed by France was more in line with the principle of resident ethnicity.</p>
<p>\[Reuters, Paris, 5th\] After the Foreign Ministers Conference again reached an impasse on the Italian-Yugoslav border issue, attendees at the conference have been divided into two camps regarding the success or failure of the conference. The British side believes that yesterday's impasse will make it impossible to resolve the Italian peace treaty at this session, so Byrnes' proposal to replace the peace treaty with a revised armistice agreement is likely to be adopted. On the other hand, there is a more optimistic view, which is based on two reasons: (1) Byrnes came to Paris on President Truman's special plane, "Sacred Cow". Byrnes ordered the plane to return to the United States to be used by the President before May 10, so it is expected that Byrnes will stay in Paris until after May 10. Therefore, the conference cannot be considered to have broken down. (2) The US Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Smith, who was originally scheduled to return to the Soviet Union this weekend, is still staying in Paris, which shows that the United States is determined to break the impasse.</p>
<p>Switzerland's New Trends - A Nation That Has Never Been Involved in War - Translated Manuscript from This Newspaper's Compilation Office</p>
<p>General Economic Situation</p>
<p>According to the latest 1945 Swiss economic report published by the Swiss Federal Economic Research Committee, the number of employed workers increased by 4.3% in the third and fourth quarters of 1945, exceeding December 1944 by 12.1%. The labor shortage was most severe in the industrial and agricultural sectors, for two reasons: First, agricultural and industrial products were previously imported from foreign countries. Since imports have ceased, they must be produced domestically, thus increasing the demand for labor. Second, there is a need to meet the urgent demands of areas and countries ravaged by war. The sharp increase in exports offset the decline in domestic market demand. According to export quantity statistics, the quantity of Swiss exports increased by about three-quarters compared to the same period before the war.</p>
<p>Due to certain circumstances, especially the devaluation of major food imports, the price level in Switzerland showed a downward trend in the last quarter of 1945. The prices of domestically manufactured products remained relatively stable, but the prices of imported goods fell by 7.5%. Although the prices of clothing and fuel increased slightly, the cost of living index fell by about 1.4% due to the decrease in food prices. However, workers' wages are adjusted to the current situation, and the actual purchasing power of ordinary workers has reached the level of 1939.</p>
<p>Investments in Germany</p>
<p>Like most other countries, especially the Netherlands, the UK, and the US, Switzerland invested a large amount of capital in Germany between 1924 and 1931. The purpose of the investment was to help Germany rebuild, consolidate its national economy, and restore its international position. However, the inflow of Swiss capital into Germany suddenly stopped in 1931 (the year of the economic panic in Central Europe, two years before Hitler came to power). After this economic panic occurred, some Swiss capitalists even recovered their investments, but after a few months, Germany adopted currency control policies, and this transaction was terminated. Since 1932, Switzerland has no longer invested in Germany.</p>
<p>Contents of the National Defense Plan</p>
<p>During World War II, Switzerland had a total of about 500,000 troops in all its lines of defense, and about 300,000 men and women served in the front and rear. In addition, 100,000 people were mobilized to form the domestic defense force. Thus, the total number of Swiss troops actually participating in national defense work was 900,000, accounting for about one-fifth of the country's population of 4.3 million.</p>
<p>The wartime national defense expenditure was about 9 billion Swiss francs; of which 2.8 billion Swiss francs were used for military equipment, 830 million Swiss francs were used for fortifications, and about 4.5 billion Swiss francs were used for wartime mobilization emergency expenses. The remaining 1.1 billion Swiss francs were used for the military welfare fund. This 9 billion Swiss franc national defense expenditure means that each citizen was assigned more than 2,000 Swiss francs, which proves that the Swiss people are willing to sacrifice to defend the independence and neutrality of their motherland.</p>
<p>Overview of Hydroelectric Power</p>
<p>From 1944 to 1945, the total amount of electricity in Switzerland was 9.655 billion kilowatt-hours. There are several reasons why Switzerland's electricity production has increased significantly in the past few years: (1) Switzerland is a country rich in white coal, and hydropower is its only natural resource. (2) Due to the difficulty in obtaining coal, this natural resource has been fully utilized, and several large power plants have been built in the country, all using the natural power of mountain waterfalls and rivers.</p>
<p>Switzerland's electricity consumption has increased from 7.432 billion kilowatt-hours to 8.771 billion kilowatt-hours, representing the energy of 230,000 tons of imported coal. From 1944 to 1945, only 160,000 tons of coal were imported into Switzerland. Therefore, it is easy to imagine how important this modern power source is to a small country. The Swiss Federal Railways are completely electrified, and the electricity consumed last year was 1.5 million kilowatt hours more than in 1943, but the consumption in the industrial sector has decreased.</p>
<p>Survey of Factory Workers</p>
<p>On September 20, 1945, Switzerland conducted a national survey of factory workers. The survey results are as follows: On this day, the total number of workers employed in various industries was 435,603, an increase of 9,543 compared to 426,010 in the previous year. This survey figure is close to the highest record of September 17, 1941 (i.e., 435,862).</p>
<p>Trends in Industry and Commerce</p>
<p>Switzerland has a significant tendency toward high industrialization. This trend can be clearly seen from the country's government's industrial and commercial registration figures. At the end of 1945, there were a total of 110,090 formally registered commercial firms. Among these figures, an interesting feature is that sole proprietorships account for the largest number, totaling 59,713. The second largest is partnerships, totaling 18,243. The least common is limited companies, with only 890. Among all regions in the country, the region with the most developed industry and the most commercial firms has 17,058 companies. The second largest is the Canton of Bern, with 16,596 companies. The Canton of Vaud has 12,273, and then Geneva. The distribution of Swiss industry and commerce is roughly as described above.</p>

<p>The Whole City Joyfully Celebrates – Lanterns and Decorations Welcome the Return of the Capital – City Party Headquarters, Youth League, etc. Hold Commemorative Ceremonies – Deputy Mayor He Broadcasts Encouraging Citizens to Assist in Construction</p>
<p>\[This Newspaper's Report\] All sectors of the city celebrated the anniversary of the return of the National Government to the capital yesterday in a joyful mood.</p>
<p>All agencies, organizations, factories, and schools were closed, and national flags flew throughout the city. The authorities, with leaders gathered in the capital, did not hold any large-scale celebrations. The City Party Headquarters and the Youth League held commemorative ceremonies. The Heroes' Association also held a celebration of the return to the capital and a members' gathering at 9:00 AM yesterday.</p>
<p>Many stores throughout the city held special sales to decorate and celebrate the grand return of the capital. When reporters browsed the streets, they saw lanterns and decorations, and many stores announced their resumption of business or new openings. There were also firecrackers along Nanjing Road, and pedestrians were shoulder to shoulder, more so than usual. Ticket lines were seen in front of various entertainment venues.</p>
<p>The police department and the city defense corps dispatched patrol teams, armed with live ammunition, to patrol the streets. The order of the whole city was as peaceful as usual.</p>
<p>Yesterday's weather was still not sunny, with widespread overcast skies, which was like a symbol of the current domestic political situation. Generally, people hoped that after the return of the National Government to the capital, the political haze that had been gathering for a long time could be cleared. Last night, after listening to Chairman Chiang's broadcast of the return to the capital address to the city, the citizens of the city were more convinced that the National Government would be able to quickly reach a reasonable solution to the current political situation and lead the country to the road of revitalization and construction.</p>
<p>Deputy Mayor He Broadcasts Speech</p>
<p>Deputy Mayor He Dachan, from 7:50 PM to 8:00 PM last night, delivered a broadcast speech to the public at the Shanghai Broadcasting Station, celebrating the return to the capital. He said, "The return of the National Government to Nanjing is the most important event after our country's victory. The whole country is holding warm celebrations simultaneously. The grand return to the capital ceremony held under Zijin Mountain today was so solemn. Mayor Qian made a special trip to the capital to attend the grand event on behalf of the four million citizens of Shanghai. When we celebrate the return to the capital, we must first thank Chairman Chiang for his unparalleled achievements in leading the military and civilians of the whole country to victory in the War of Resistance. During the eight years of the War of Resistance, Shanghai was thousands of miles away from the wartime capital after its fall, and most citizens lived in isolation, unable to breathe the air of free China. Now that the government has returned to Nanjing, it can be said that the central government is within easy reach. We Shanghai citizens have the geographical privilege of 'being the first to enjoy the moonlight near the water.' From now on, we should invigorate our spirits and abide by the central government's laws as soon as we know them. Although it is now the period of national reconstruction after the war, our national difficulties have not yet been completely overcome, so we must 'worry about the world's troubles before others, and enjoy the world's pleasures after others.' We should take out all the advanced manpower and resources of Shanghai's industry and commerce to assist the government in promoting various construction projects related to the national economy and people's livelihood. Tomorrow's China will become a strong, prosperous, and happy country based on the Three Principles of the People, and the contribution of Shanghai citizens will be one of the main factors in its realization."</p>
<p>Congratulatory Telegrams Sent to Pay Respects</p>
<p>The Songhu Garrison Headquarters sent a telegram to Chairman Chiang to congratulate the return of the National Government to the capital, stating: "Respectfully to Chairman Chiang, on the occasion of the return to the capital on this grand Fifth of May ceremony, countless people are rejoicing, and both China and foreign countries are admiring. We celebrate the eternal consolidation of the country and wish for the complete elimination of the haze. We respectfully offer our congratulations and humbly request your consideration. Li Jier, Commander of the Songhu Garrison Headquarters, bows in respect, on the Chen day, the Zhi hour, sealed." Other government agencies and local elders in the city, such as Huang Jinrong, also sent telegrams to Chairman Chiang to extend their congratulations.</p>
<p>The "Triumph" Train Makes Its First Trip, Inviting Reporters to Tour Wuxi</p>
<p>\[This Newspaper's Report\] The Jinghu Railway Administration, in order to welcome the triumphant return of military and government personnel to the capital and reduce passenger congestion, has added a special express train, the "Triumph" train, from yesterday, the anniversary of the return to the capital. It departs from Shanghai at 7:00 AM every morning and arrives in Nanjing at 2:00 PM. It then departs from Nanjing at 3:50 PM and returns to Shanghai at 10:50 PM that night. The train made its maiden voyage yesterday morning. The Railway Administration specially invited reporters from Shanghai newspapers and news agencies to take the train to tour Wuxi. Gu Yaojie, head of the Business Section of the Transportation Department, and Shen Zunkong, director of the Passenger Transportation Section, accompanied them. After arriving in Wuxi, Station Master Zhang Mutao led them to visit famous scenic spots in Wuxi, such as Yuantouzhu, Xiaoji Mountain, Meiyuan, Huishan, and Taihu Lake. They enjoyed themselves to the fullest. The reporters returned to Shanghai on the original train at 11:00 PM that night.</p>
<p>It is reported that the train body is painted blue, and the interior is beautiful and clean. It is also disinfected with sprays from time to time to prevent the spread of diseases. It is also the first to implement reserved seating.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Offices of the Executive Yuan and the Military Statistics Bureau are Ordered to Close</p>
<p>According to reliable sources, the Executive Yuan has all returned to the capital. The temporary Shanghai office of the President of the Yuan was ordered to close yesterday. As for the application for airplane seats on the Shanghai-Beiping line, it was approved by the President of the Yuan and will continue to be handled by China National Aviation Corporation from the same date. It is also understood that if President Song needs to come to Shanghai for official business in the future, he may still meet with important guests at the original location.</p>
<p>The Military Affairs Commission's Investigation and Statistics Bureau established a Shanghai office at 70 Du Mei Road after the victory of the War of Resistance and during the Shanghai takeover, specializing in arresting traitors. Since the Statistics Bureau has now been restored and moved to the capital, and the traitor cases have been transferred to the courts, the Shanghai office is no longer necessary. Therefore, it has been ordered to close and be abolished at the end of April. The owner of the house at 70 Du Mei Road, Du Yuesheng, has also recovered the property for his own use.</p>
<p>The Work of the Engineering Planning Group Is Actively Underway - Concrete Plans for Improving Ports and Railways Have Been Drafted - Request Submitted to the Executive Yuan for Funding</p>
<p>\[This Newspaper's Report\] The Engineering Planning Group of the Executive Yuan has been established in Shanghai for two months and is actively carrying out its work. It has drafted a "National Preliminary Engineering Plan." Details were given in yesterday's newspaper. It is now learned that the group has also drafted concrete plans for the repair and improvement of transportation and port projects. The two most important points are: First, the construction of Tanggu New Port. The plan has now been finalized and is being submitted to President Song of the Yuan for funding. The port is of great importance to the prosperity of Tianjin, so this plan is a beneficial undertaking. It is planned to build two north and south breakwaters. The piers will be equipped with the latest loading and unloading equipment and automatic coal loaders. In addition, it is planned to build warehouses and concrete roads, and to add special stone-carrying trains on the Beining Road to facilitate the construction. The estimated cost of all the above projects is over 20 million US dollars. It is heard that the port project will use mechanized tools for construction. At the same time, a large number of young engineers will be trained. The first phase of the plan is expected to be completed within two years. After the initial plan is completed, the new port's annual throughput will be more than 4 million tons, and the water depth will be 6 meters at low tide, which can be expanded to 8 meters in the future. In terms of construction, there are 2.862 million tons of breakwaters, 15.5 million cubic yards of dredged deep waterways, 100,000 square yards of pier pavement, one pier No. 2, one barge pier, 50,000 cubic yards of rubble work, one sluice gate, 40,000 feet of railway, and 200,000 square yards of concrete road.</p>
<p>It is also heard that after the port was recently reopened, one ship sunk by the Japanese when they withdrew has been salvaged, and eight mud boats are still intact. The port's repair machine shop has also resumed work.</p>
<p>Secondly, the plan for repairing and building railways has also been finalized and submitted to the Executive Yuan. Among them, if the Jinpu Railway is to be completely repaired after it is opened, it will require more than 19 million US dollars. The group recommends the rapid organization of powerful material ordering, expediting, transportation, and allocation agencies, the use of medicated sleepers, and the organization of bridge and ballast engineering teams to piece together and utilize damaged bridges. Mechanical methods will be used to manufacture ballast to greatly supplement railway materials. It is also heard that the Yellow River Bridge on the Pinghan Railway is too old, and the group believes that it cannot bear the weight, so it is recommended to replace it together.</p>
<p>American Engineers Inspect for Days</p>
<p>The American engineers of the group, Ted Todd, Pushing, and Finney, have been inspected at the request of the Municipal Engineering Bureau, the Public Works Bureau, and the Railway Bureau for several days. From May 2, they inspected Wusong, the future location of foreign shipping terminals, Zhanghuabang Railway Pier, the Dredging Bureau Repair Shop, Qiujiang Pier, Fuxing Island, various roads in the old city center, Yixian Road, Jungong Road, Beijing Road Ferry, Zhoujiadu, Dongchang, Qingningsi, and other piers, and Shangnan Railway and Pudong Avenue. Yesterday afternoon, they inspected the Lianglu Central Station, Maigen Road Freight Station, and the proposed dry bridge location on Xizang North Road. The Engineering Bureau, the Public Works Bureau, and the Railway Bureau will seek the group's opinions on the construction of ports and transportation in the city.</p>
<p>In addition, the highway group of the group, engineers Fang Fusen and Lu Xiaodan, and American technical consultant Hurd Roberts, together with Director Wu of the Technical Office of the Highway Administration, and a group of five people, flew to Hankou on the 3rd and transferred to Changsha, Hengyang, Guiyang, Chongqing, Chengdu, Xi'an, and other places. Along the way, they will inspect the highways on the Hunan, Hubei, Southwest, Sichuan, and Shaanxi lines and discuss plans to improve construction projects with the relevant authorities. It is heard that this trip will last for three weeks. After returning to Shanghai, they will go to Beiping and other places. Mr. Hou Jiayuan, the head of the group, has returned to Shanghai after inspecting water conservancy in Qiuyan a few days ago.</p>
<p>Under the Drizzling Rain, Mr. Evans Carlson's Condition - The Cold Smile Felt Even More Sorrow</p>
<p>Hearing that Mr. Evans Carlson's condition has improved recently, I rushed to the quiet Hong'en Hospital again yesterday afternoon in the drizzling rain, full of joy.</p>
<p>Pushing open the door of Mr. Carlson's room, I suddenly felt that there were many more things than when I found him a month ago - there was a screen at the door, and three dark embroideries on the wall. A large red satin embroidery screen was hanging straight, and two white ones were hanging horizontally, all covered with small flowers. The embroidery seemed not very skillful. There were also several more bookshelves along the wall, densely lined with books. The colorful covers were very beautiful, mostly novels. There was also a very beautiful wireless radio in front of Mr. Carlson's bed.</p>
<p>His Spirit Is Not As Good As Before</p>
<p>However, his spirit is not as good as before. I feel that he is more haggard than the last time I saw him. I forced myself to cheer up and asked about his condition, and congratulated him on the progress of his condition. But after he looked at me with sharp eyes, he said: "The doctors are all trying hard to tell me that my illness has turned around, but there is still a lot of water in my lungs, and I have to drain a lot of water every week. If this water does not decrease, I am afraid that the condition may not improve much? Although the doctors want to make me believe it, they cannot prove their statement to me." He seemed to smile again unintentionally, but this cold smile only made me feel more desolate.</p>
<p>I talked about the books he was reading, and he said: "I am too lazy to pick any good books. Reading is just to keep me from thinking too much."</p>
<p>He Has Already Given Up Writing</p>
<p>Because there was white paper, a pen, and ink on the table in front of his bed, I asked him: "Have you been writing anything lately?"</p>
<p>"I have already given up writing. Although I started writing a memoir, I feel that it is better not to write it anymore. I only want to write down the facts, but in China - you will know in another ten or fifteen years that writing down the facts may not make you happy!"</p>
<p>I asked him to comment on Churchill's several speeches in the United States. He said: "I don't believe there will be a third world war. The United States has the atomic bomb, and the saying that the Soviet Union also has the atomic bomb is just a rumor. Under this situation, would the Soviet Union be willing to go to war? The current war of words is only because everyone does not know to what extent the Soviet Union's demands will go, but this is only a matter of time. We will know what the Soviet Union's demands are soon. I firmly believe that a world war can be avoided, because there is really no need to fight."</p>
<p>He Is Still Panting Very Badly</p>
<p>"What do you think of the Kuomintang-Communist issue?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Perhaps, from the perspective of the Communist Party, this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to expand their influence, so they will do anything to achieve their goals." He paused and said in an extremely slow and serious tone; "I only hope now that General Marshall's efforts and Chairman Chiang's repeated concessions can make the Communist Party understand that now is really the time for the whole country to unite as one."</p>
<p>When I saw Mr. Carlson this time, he didn't use his left hand to hold his lungs as often as last time, but he was still panting very badly. He smiled bitterly and said, "After the victory, everyone is getting worse and worse, and my own body is the same."</p>
<p>He is still being treated by two doctors, and only eats liquids and soft bread every day. He ate some ham a few days ago, but yesterday morning, the doctor said that it is better not to eat ham. One of the nurses said, "He is still in good spirits and sleeps well at night." However, when I asked her if there was any improvement in Carlson's condition, she suddenly became silent.</p>
<p>Gunfire Erupts in Front of the Taishan Cinema - Bullets Fly Across Xinmin Road, Injuring Four Soldiers and Passersby</p>
<p>The Moviegoers Watching the Movie Were Frightened</p>
<p>\[This Newspaper's Report\] At 8:00 PM last night, the evening show of the movie "Wu Song and Pan Jinlian" was being shown at the Taishan Cinema at 81 Xinmin Road at the end of Henan Road. The audience was crowded. At about 8:30 PM, several soldiers from the 6th Company of the 2nd Battalion of the Military Police Team went to inspect. They ordered any soldiers they saw to leave. Several people with improper clothing were ordered to stand aside, preparing to lecture them. Seeing that Lian Mingchun, a police officer from the 7th Squadron of the Traffic Police of the Ministry of Transportation, was particularly improperly dressed, they immediately corrected him. Unexpectedly, Feng Fushou, a first-class police officer from the 8th Squadron's machine gun squad, who had a pistol and 47 rounds of ammunition, came forward to mediate, causing a very intense dispute. Before long, more than a dozen armed people, carrying new-style carbine rifles and a machine gun, crowded over. Seeing the situation deteriorating, the cinema quickly closed the iron gates. The military police immediately prepared to resist, while notifying the garrison headquarters patrol team by telephone. More than 30 reserve team members were dispatched. As they approached the cinema gate, gunfire suddenly erupted, firing twice. The first time lasted about 15 minutes, and the second time lasted about 5 minutes. A hand grenade also exploded, breaking the power lines next to the road. The patrol team was caught off guard because the entrance was dark, and the injured soldiers included Chen Shaoqing, a soldier from the 5th Company of the Special Service Team, who was shot twice in the left leg, and Wang Baogen, a squad leader from the 4th Company, who was shot once in the buttocks. Stray bullets injured Yu Tanggen, a tea server at the Xindu Hotel, who was injured in the neck; and Cui Henglin, a fried rice cake vendor, who was injured in the right leg. When large numbers of military police and defense corps members rushed to the scene after hearing the news, the shooters had already left. Because the cinema had closed the iron gates, the audience was forbidden to leave, and the movie continued to be shown in the cinema without stopping, so the order was not chaotic. It was not until the movie ended that they were dismissed. The other soldiers on the scene were also questioned by the military police one by one before being released. The injured soldiers and passersby were taken to the Municipal Fourth Hospital and the Public Charity Hospital by ambulances. Lian Mingchun and Feng Fushou were arrested and sent to the Garrison Headquarters for disposal. The surrounding area of the cinema was patrolled by the Defense Corps and military police, traffic was cut off, and martial law was temporarily imposed until 11:00 PM when the situation returned to normal.</p>
<p>Central District Street Lights to Be Replaced with Germicidal Fluorescent Lights</p>
<p>The street lights on the roads in the central district of the city will be completely replaced with a new type of fluorescent light that has germicidal power, which will be of great benefit to our health. It is understood that the new fluorescent lights are expected to be shipped from the United States to Shanghai by the end of this month.</p>
<p>Two Sugar Experts Arrive in Shanghai After Completing Investigation Work in Taiwan</p>
<p>The Resources Committee hired two sugar experts from the American Engineering Consulting Firm, Handelmann and Cooper, to go to Taiwan Province in early February to investigate sugar production. After staying for two months, Handelmann and Cooper flew to Shanghai from Taiwan yesterday. According to them, although the sugar factories in Taiwan Province are gradually recovering, their production capacity and machine replacement still need to be improved. They have prepared a written opinion, which they will fly</p>

<p>Statistics on Supplementary Education for Out-of-School People Throughout China: 7 Million Adults, 3 Million Women</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch] Since the Ministry of Education formulated the "Five-Year Implementation Plan for National Education," all primary schools in various provinces and cities have been uniformly changed to Central National Schools and National Schools. Regardless of whether they are Central National Schools or National Schools, they should all concurrently conduct supplementary education for out-of-school people. Therefore, all National Schools, in addition to establishing a children's department for school-age children to attend, also conduct supplementary education for adults and women. In addition, there are People's Schools that provide supplementary education for out-of-school adults and women. It is now learned that the Ministry of Education, based on the results of the survey and statistics for the 32nd academic year reported by the education departments of various provinces and cities, has the following figures: (1) In Central National Schools, the number of out-of-school people receiving supplementary education is 1,198,861 adults and 637,056 women, totaling 1,885,917 men and women. (2) In National Schools, 4,664,664 adults and 2,237,530 women receive supplementary education, totaling 6,802,194 men and women. (3) In People's Schools, 12,785,18 adults and 2,137,530 women receive supplementary education, totaling 2,137,530 men and women. The total number of out-of-school people receiving supplementary education is 10,040,7612, including 7,142,043 adults and 3,265,569 women. (Fool)</p>
<p>Guangxi University to Rebuild Guilin Campus; Completion Expected This Month, Classes to Resume at the End of the Month</p>
<p>[Our Liuzhou Dispatch] Since President Chen Jian took office at National Guangxi University, he immediately organized a campus relocation committee to actively carry out work. It is reported that President Chen and staff have gone to Guilin in batches. The Guilin campus of the university is expected to be fully renovated by mid-May, and classes are scheduled to resume at the end of May to make up for the unfinished courses during the temporary suspension due to the relocation. The university has already held the first semester exams for students above the second grade of each department since April 11, and the first-year students of each department also held quizzes at the same time. In addition, students in Wuzhou took various exams starting from April 18. After the exams, classes were suspended, and the relocation to Guilin is now underway.</p>
<p>Ministry of Education Issues National Order: Temporary Measures for Aiding Out-of-School Children; Establishing Primary School Classes in Private Homes</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 4th] During the War of Resistance, local education institutions in the war zones were almost completely destroyed by the enemy and puppets. After the victory, the recovered areas are finding it extremely difficult to restore local education. In major cities, due to the restoration, the number of school-age children has increased sharply, and local educational administrative organs are temporarily unable to establish more national schools to accommodate them, resulting in an increasing number of out-of-school children. The Ministry of Education has specially formulated "Temporary Measures for Urban Organizations and Private Homes to Assist Local Governments in Aiding Out-of-School Children by Establishing Primary Schools or Primary School Classes," ordering education bureaus in various provinces and cities to mobilize organizations and private homes in various cities to establish primary schools or primary school classes to accommodate as many out-of-school children as possible, and to utilize existing houses, grounds, and equipment of organizations and private homes to facilitate the process. The necessary expenses will also be the responsibility of the various organizations to raise funds themselves, and if insufficient, the local educational administrative organs will provide appropriate subsidies. These measures will be announced soon.</p>
<p>Peiping University's Fifth Branch Requests to Be Changed to an Independent Institute of Technology</p>
<p>[Dahua News Agency, Peiping] The student union of the Fifth Branch of Lin Da University (formerly the Institute of Technology) became puzzled upon learning that the branch would be jointly run by Tsinghua University and Peking University. They all believed that after the victory, everything should be rebuilt, and the revitalization of industry was even more urgent. The original establishment should be restored as an Institute of Technology. More than 900 students of the branch yesterday issued a declaration to all sectors, opposing the joint operation by Tsinghua University and Peking University, and requesting the government to change the branch into an independent Institute of Technology.</p>
<p>Sichuan Education Restoration Funds Approved for Four Hundred Million</p>
<p>[Our Chengdu Dispatch] Education restoration in Sichuan Province is being actively prepared. The restoration funds account for 80% of the total funds, approximately 40 million yuan. The Ministry of Education had already adjusted the schools slightly during the winter vacation last year, using a huge sum of 160 million yuan. The excess funds were temporarily advanced by the provincial government. In mid-April, Director Liu Mingyang went to Chongqing to request the Ministry of Finance to increase Sichuan Province's restoration funds to 1 billion yuan, of which education restoration funds would account for 800 million yuan, and also requested approval for the provincial government to advance the funds. It is now confirmed that the Ministry of Finance has approved 400 million yuan. According to the ratio of the requested increase to the approved amount, education restoration funds will account for 320 million yuan. There are still more than 50 schools in the province that have not been restored. If savings can be made, the funds can be sufficient. (Quan)</p>
<p>Jiaozuo Institute of Technology to Restore Campus in Sichuan; Active Preparation, Huge Funds Raised</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Kaifeng, 4th] The Ministry of Education has approved the restoration of Jiaozuo Institute of Technology in Henan, but due to financial difficulties, there has been no concrete plan. Recently, a businessman from Sichuan, Mr. Zuozi, sent a letter requesting the university to restore its campus in Sichuan and has raised huge funds. It can be implemented once the board of directors of the university agrees.</p>
<p>Ministry of Education Rewards Recovered Areas for Restoring Secondary Schools; Monthly Reports and Rewards from Provincial and Municipal Education Bureaus</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Special] In order to quickly restore secondary schools in the recovered provinces and cities and actively promote secondary education, the Ministry of Education has specially formulated measures to reward the recovered provinces and cities (including Jiangsu, Shandong, Shanxi, Hebei, Henan, Guangxi, Hunan, Zhejiang, Guangdong, Hubei, Jiangxi, Anhui, Rehe, Chahar, Suiyuan, Fujian, and other provinces, and Beijing, Shanghai, Qingdao, Peiping, Tianjin, and other cities) for restoring secondary schools, which were submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval and implementation. For secondary schools in the above-mentioned recovered provinces and cities, the number established before the war will be the benchmark. Except for schools that were not damaged during the War of Resistance and have been restored after the end of the War of Resistance, each province and city will receive a bonus from the Ministry based on the degree of damage, divided into different levels. However, this will be temporarily limited to provincial and excellent private schools. As for county-level secondary schools, the Education Department should order the counties to mobilize local financial resources to restore them as soon as possible. The time for rewarding provinces and cities for restoring secondary schools has been set from February of this year to January of next year. The Education Department and Bureau of the recovered provinces and cities should report the restoration status monthly within the specified time, which will be reviewed and approved by the Ministry. The rewards will be submitted by the Ministry to the Executive Yuan for approval, and after reaching the Ministry, they will be allocated by the Ministry. (An)</p>
<p>Yingshi University Unrest Subsides, Classes Resume as Usual</p>
<p>[Our Hangzhou Dispatch] The unrest at National Yingshi University, which resulted in a strike, lasted for 41 days (from March 2 to April 11). The unrest subsided after Inspector Shen Yizhen from the Ministry of Education went to the school to investigate. After Inspector Shen arrived in Wenzhou on April 15, he immediately summoned students from the Law and Agriculture departments for a discussion the next day. The atmosphere was filled with intense discussion. Afterward, Inspector Shen held several meetings with representatives of the student union, listening to various reports. The students requested a thorough investigation into the school administration measures during President Du's tenure. Starting from April 18, students from various departments unanimously cut back on food to show their determination to improve the school. Inspector Shen was quite moved. Before leaving, he acknowledged in a semi-public speech that the students no longer trusted President Du. He also promised to convey the students' requests for various school administration reforms to the Ministry of Education. The students were extremely excited upon hearing this. Recently, classes in various departments have resumed as usual. (Butterfly)</p>

<p>Special Article: Education Restoration in Hunan (Continued)</p>
<p>Our Changsha Special Correspondent: Gao Yuanli</p>
<p>After the Xiang-Gui War</p>
<p>However, after the Xiang-Gui war in June of the 32nd year, Hunan's education suffered unprecedented blows and losses. Several education centers, such as Changsha, Xiangtan, Hengyang, and Shaoyang, were successively lost, school buildings were burned, equipment was damaged, and books and instruments were lost. In particular, higher education was completely wiped out. The three provincial vocational schools of agriculture, industry, and commerce were suspended. Among the 132 county and municipal secondary schools, 98 were affected. Among the 38 provincial secondary schools, 28 were affected. Among the 217 private secondary schools, 181 were affected. 649 central national schools were affected. 6,307 bao national schools were affected. 1,380 private primary schools were affected. 14 provincial primary schools were affected. In total, 8,350 public and private primary schools were affected, with a total loss of more than 89 billion yuan.</p>
<p>Although the losses were so great, the schools still moved from the cities to the countryside to continue classes. Many county secondary schools continued to have classes as usual not far from the enemy. Some students in some places even prepared for emergencies while attending classes. This kind of perseverance is truly admirable. Fortunately, the area west of Hunan was not ravaged by the enemy, and the schools there were preserved and continued to have classes.</p>
<p>This difficult support was maintained until the end of the war.</p>
<p>After the End of the War</p>
<p>After the end of the war, education should plan for restoration. The progress in the past six months has been quite smooth. The two provincial vocational schools of technology and engineering have been restored in Changsha. The business vocational school is temporarily restored with the Second Vocational School in Nanyue. In terms of secondary education, almost all provincial schools have been restored and moved back to their original locations. In terms of national education, because the schools are not concentrated in one place, restoration is easier, and most have actively started classes amid the ruins. The overall restoration situation is satisfactory.</p>
<p>However, the most difficult problem is still the school buildings. The restored schools either repair the existing school buildings for use, or rent civilian houses and ancestral halls to start classes. There is no ability to raise huge amounts of money to build school buildings. Hunan's disaster situation is also extremely tragic. According to the total estimated funds required for restoration by the Ministry of Education, more than 57.8 billion yuan is needed. The central government cannot approve these funds, and the local government cannot raise them on its own. It is not easy to restore the old appearance.</p>
<p>The allocation of temporary restoration funds is only given to provincial schools, and private schools are not included. Therefore, the restoration of private secondary schools is even more difficult. As a result, the schools stipulate that in addition to the grain salary, so-called relocation and construction fees are charged, with each person paying one dan of rice. The education authorities cannot provide assistance to private secondary schools, and it is not convenient to stop this matter. In fact, it is equivalent to tacitly approving it. As a result, the burden on students is increased, and a considerable number of students drop out of school because of this. This matter deserves attention.</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of standards, Director Wang admitted that the standards have been greatly reduced in recent years, partly because of insufficient equipment, and partly because the number of schools has increased dramatically, and there is a lack of teachers, resulting in this deformed phenomenon of quantity and quality. However, it is by no means easy to improve it in the near future.</p>
<p>Inspector He from the Zhejiang Education Department Departs to Inspect Various Places</p>
<p>[New Shanghai News Agency, Xingjia Dispatch] He Gang, an inspector from the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Education, has arrived in Jiaxing a few days ago to inspect the education restoration situation in various parts of Zhejiang Province. He will go to the provincial middle school, county middle school, and Xiumin middle school for inspection, and will then go to Huzhou for inspection.</p>
<p>Educational Facilities in Taiwan Province After Restoration</p>
<p>The Principle is That Schools Do Not Suspend Classes</p>
<p>[Dahua News Agency, Taipei Dispatch] Since Taiwan was taken over, under the principle of "schools do not suspend classes" by Chief Executive Chen, the main educational facilities are as follows: (1) In terms of higher education, Taiwan Province originally had Taipei Imperial University, which included the Faculties of Arts and Politics, Science, Agriculture, Engineering, Medicine, University Preparatory Course, and Medical Specialty Department. After being taken over by the Ministry of Education, it was renamed National Taiwan University. There are also three specialized schools: Taichung Agricultural and Forestry Specialized School, Tainan Industrial Specialized School, and Taipei Economic Specialized School, which were taken over by the Education Department of the Taiwan Provincial Government and renamed Taichung Provincial Agricultural Specialized School. Tainan Industrial Specialized School and Taipei College of Law and Commerce continue to have classes. In terms of secondary schools, after the takeover, those that were originally public were all changed to provincial, including three provincial normal schools, one provincial women's normal school, one provincial high school, eighteen provincial middle schools, twenty women's middle schools, nine provincial agricultural vocational schools, one aquatic vocational school, eight industrial vocational schools, and seven commercial vocational schools. In addition, there are six private middle schools and two vocational schools, which are all currently having classes. In terms of national education, the province has a total of 1,009 national schools and 95 kindergartens, with approximately 70% of children enrolled in school.</p>
<p>Responding to the Respect for Teachers Movement; Parents of Students in People's Schools Voluntarily Donate Funds; Kai Cheng Stationery Company Donates Commission</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Dispatch] Parents of students in various municipal people's schools are voluntarily participating in the Respect for Teachers Movement and soliciting donations. According to Yu Qingtang, the deputy director of the Respect for Teachers Movement Committee, the total amount of donations from various municipal people's schools is approximately one million yuan. The Municipal People's Experimental School independently raised 400,000 yuan, which has already been sent to the bank. (Ren)</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] Ding Brand stencil paper, produced by Kai Cheng Stationery Company in this city, has always been adopted by the education sector and is particularly popular in Chongqing, Chengdu, and other inland areas.

<p>Yesterday's Charity Football Match: Donghua Painfully Defeats British Naval Team, Winning 6-2; First Half Ends in a 1-1 Draw</p>
<p>The charity football match organized by the Football Committee of the Municipal Sports Association was held between the Donghua team and the British Navy team at 3:00 pm yesterday at Yiyuan Stadium. There were no less than 6,000 spectators. Director Gu of the Education Bureau did not attend due to business, so the opening ceremony was cancelled. Yesterday, the Donghua team demonstrated superb football skills and won a great victory. The fans on the left field were all overjoyed. The first half ended in a 1-1 draw, and the final score was 6-2. Yesterday's battle situation was as follows:</p>
<p>Donghua Team</p>
<p>Liu Xianhan, Li Ning, Zhuang Youren, Han Longbo, Fu Zhen, Lin Wenhu, Li Yao, Song Lingsheng, Han Longhai, Sun Jinshun, Jia Youliang</p>
<p>British Navy Team</p>
<p>Le Fumen, Qu Luomeng, Huo Li Huasi, Ge Lie Gu Lai, Ying Gelan, Fen Qu, En Shao Hui Si, Tang Na Lai, William Shi, Heng Tuo, Luo Si Ke</p>
<p>Taking the Lead with One Goal</p>
<p>At exactly 3:00 pm, referee Wang Shoufang and linesmen Huang Renyi and He Chunhui entered the field successively. The British Navy won the right to kick off and immediately attacked Donghua, but was blocked by Fu Zhen and Lin Wenhu. Geli Gulai strongly resisted. William Shi missed the opportunity, allowing Han Longbo to seize the ball. Song Lingsheng was about to shoot when Huo Li Huasi rushed to save and committed a foul. Li Yao executed, kicking the ball high into the net from 20 yards away. 1-0, Donghua took the lead, only five or six minutes into the game. The British team tried hard to counterattack, but they were unable to. After ten minutes, Li Yao launched an attack from the left, approaching the goal, but unfortunately missed. Not long after, En Shao Huisi, the left winger of the British Navy, crossed the ball into the middle. Tang Na Lai's leg rose like an arrow. Fortunately, Liu Xianhan was quick to react and prevented the goal. At the 22nd minute, Li Yao received a pass and launched a sharp kick. Le Fumen patted it out. At the 35th minute, William Shi broke through alone. Zhuang Youren failed to block him and entered the penalty area. The ball rolled in, and Liu Xianhan was slow to save, and the ball entered the net. 1-1, the British Navy tied the score. Not long after, the whistle blew, and the first half ended with each team scoring one goal.</p>
<p>A Great Victory</p>
<p>After halftime, the two teams continued to fight with the same lineup. Donghua became more courageous as they fought. Han Longhai seemed to have divine help, charging left and right. Looking back at the British army, they showed signs of fatigue, the battle lines shook, and there were loopholes everywhere. At the 20th minute, Longhai scored with the help of Fu Zhen, scoring close to the goal. 2-1, Donghua took the lead again. Five minutes later, Han Longhai sang and danced on his own, and once again made a great contribution, celebrating victory. 3-1, the British Navy lost another city. The British Navy was unwilling to give up and launched a joint counterattack. Tang Na Lai appeared behind the Donghua line, sweeping into the net from six or seven yards away. 3-2, the British Navy gradually became active. Seeing the situation was not good, Donghua quickly devised a countermeasure. The cooperation between Song Lingsheng was very hard work. At the 35th minute, Longhai shamelessly scored another goal. 4-2, the British Navy's overall situation was gone. In the last three minutes, Youliang, with a wonderful pass from the central army, tricked Qu Luomeng and lightly pushed the ball in, making it 5-2. The British Navy still tried to resist, but Dong's attack was very strong and refused to let go. Not long after, Sun Jinshun crossed the center line and ran to the left corner, hooking the ball from the baseline, making it 6-2. Time ran out, and Donghua won a great victory.</p>
