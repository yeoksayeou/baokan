<h3>抗戰勝利後首度元旦　蔣主席昭吿軍民　外患雖攘除內憂仍嚴重願完成遺敎求安定復興</h3>
<p>〔中央社重慶三十一日電〕蔣主席豐夫人，於民國三十五年元旦之前夕下午八時，在山洞林園官邸，為紀念盟國共同勝利年，　賀馬歇爾特使六十六歲壽辰，舉行盛大宴會，到各國駐華使節，美軍總部商級將領，中央執監委員，常務委員，國府委員，各院部會長官，參政會主席國等一五一人。席間蔣主席馬特使先後致詞，互祝盟國勝利與永久合作。至十時半，賓主盡歡始散。（蔣主席致詞及馬歇爾答詞明日續播）</p>
<p>〔中央社重慶卅一日電〕蔣主席卅五年元旦，向全國軍民廣播，原詞如下：全國軍民同胞們：今天是中華民國三十五年開國紀念日，是我們抗戰勝利結束後第一度元旦。我們自九一八事變以來，在這十四年中間，都是在黑暗恥辱的環境下，來度此令節。七七抗戰以後八年之間，更是在生死存亡的戰鬥中，度此令節。現在我們抗戰已吿勝利，日本業已投降，積年國恥已經湔雪，我中華民國的全體國民，應該都可以仰首伸眉，稍紓喘息，來慶祝這一個歲首良辰。我們每一個同胞，當然是格外的歡愉，格外的欣奮，但是我們國家的處境，還是備極艱難。外患雖已攘除，內憂卻更見嚴重。這幾個月以來，演變的經過，不容諱言的，使我們同胞，在重見天日之餘，心情上仍有重重的陰影。使我們八年餘流血犧牲所獲得的國家地位，與民族光榮，頓時為之降低。而革命抗戰期中，軍民先烈的在天之靈，亦不能得到安慰。興言及此，對於國家的現狀，眞所謂一則以喜，一則以憂。但是我們可以砍，國家民族在抗戰勝利以後，必有光明的前途，而如何開拓這一個光明的前途，消除內部存在的殷憂，敢獲眞正勝利的果實，這是我們共同一致無可旁貸的責任。</p>
<p>現在縈廻於我腦際的，就是我們國父的遺敎，如何完成：人民的要求，如何實現。我們國父最後的遺敎，就是要和平奮鬥救中國，就是要完成三民主義新中國的建設。至於今日人民迫切的要求，可一言以蔽之，是求安定復興。人民的要求，和國父的遺敎，是一致的。當此戰後滿目瘡痍，我各地同胞痛苦的待救濟，流離的待還鄉，失業的待復業，受殘破的待修　，被壓迫的待解放，但是簡單的說，一切復員建設工作的前提，不外科和平與安定，民心嗎，是我們國家民族的的絕對需要，也是世界和平安全的最大關鍵。因之，我們首先急要的工作，就在於造成整個國家和平安全的環境。惟有國內不再有變亂分裂的現象，而後續有和平建設的可能：也惟有內不再有擾攘紛爭的因素，而後國家的基礎續能鞏固。人民乃得以安居樂業。我們今日在戰勝侵略痛定思痛之餘，一切政治上過渡期間的設施。容有未週，政府無不積極改進，決不因循茍且，貽誤國家復興的時機。但是最重要的，無過於確定整個的國是，使政府與人民皆有共同的軌轍可以遵循。如果國家天天在紊擾攘之中，人民日日感受惶懼不安的痛苦，則戰後的安寧建設，就無從着手。所以我在今天要將當前重要的國是，我們政府的決策，和我們人民的責任，乘此歲首更新的時候，簡單扼要的提出來，以明吿于我們全國的同胞。</p>
<h3>國民革命之目的　在建立三民主義的新中國</h3>
<p>因為今天是我們中華民國開國紀念日，所以我要首先提出我們國民革命的目的與經過，以明示我們今後努力的途徑。我們國民革命的最大目的，在於建立三民主義的新中國，而就其經過步驟來說，可以分為三個時間：第一個時期是甲午以後，從已未以迄於辛亥。在這十八年期間，其目標在於　　滿清的帝制，建立主權在於中華民國。第二個時期，是由民國二年以迄於十七年的北伐完成。在此十六年间，其目标在于扫除军阀割据的局面，实现国家的统一。第三个时期，是从民国二十年以迄于去年抗战勝利。在此十四年間，其目標在於打倒日本帝國主義的侵略，掃除建國的障礙，完成獨立自由三民主義新中的建設。這三個時期，對眾穩中有降有不同，而革命建國的目的，則是一貫不變的。國父在世之時，親自領導全國同胞而奮鬥，國父逝世以後，中國國民黨的黨員，則秉承遺志而努力。期間障礙重重，內憂外患，錯雜相互，無不為國民革命的時代偉力所摧毀。我們國父自甲午倡導革命之初，即認非　　滿清專制，無以挽救中國的危亡，實現中國的民主。</p>
<p>國父祇知有救國建國的責任，從沒有自私自利的觀念，所以辛亥革命，一經成功，就讓政權於衰世凱。不　　氏竊國，民國顧危，國民不能眞正表達自由意志和力量，而造成軍閥的割據，於是有民國二年以後的革命。迄於北伐完成，乃始獲得中國的統一。但是日本帝國主義者嫌忌我們國家的統一，自始就勾續軍閥，製造割據，欲以分裂中國者，達成滅亡中國的目的。始則有九一八的侵略，製造偽滿傀儡；繼之以華北特殊化的要求。我國民政府深知日本帝國主義者一天不驅除，則國家就一天不能統一，民主黨政就無法進行。如此不特我國家民族的生存失了保障，而世界整個和平，也必受到威脅。我們七七抗戰，就為了執行這一個神聖偉大的任務，而第二次世界大戰，也就因日本侵略而發端了。由此可和中國如果不能保持統一與獨立，即威脅着世界的和平。我們若不能順利完成建國方略與民主的建設，即不能建立強盛的中國，以自　於世界現代國家之林。</p>
<h3>國家統一與民主　為今後吾人建國努力重點</h3>
<p>現在日本帝國主義是已被打倒了，妨碍中國統一與民阻擾中國民主的外在障碍，是已消除了。而我們中國以薄弱的國力，抵抗強敵武力十四年之久，所遭受的破壞與犧牲，實已無可計數。國家的元氣，人民的生機，亦已不絕如縷。我們今天若再不乘此時機，積極復員，使社會秩序迅速恢復，使國家政治進入正軌，則國家就再無復興的機會　了。我們今天眞需要　　時機，鞏固國家的統一，實現全民的政治，以並建國的仝功。因此，我在去年勝利以後，曾　　　同胞們鄭黨提出乘復員工作與進行建設的重要。我並且特別說明，今後努力的重點，在於「國家統一與政治民主」。全國同胞們，果能細心體察我們國家的需要，便知道今天重要的國是所在了。</p>
<p>全國同胞們，我們民國成立至今，已經三十五年了，為什麼還不能完成建國方略與全民政治，唯一的原因，就是由於我們國家不統一。而推原第二次世界大戰的禍因，實亦由於我們中國的不統一所致。我們革命抗戰的目的，就是要打消侵略者分裂中國以淪亡中國的企圖。八年餘流血犧牲，也就是為了要實現國家的統一，以保障民族的生存。所以我這幾年以業，　　向國民懇切說明，國家統一的必要。我曾說國家的統一，是近代立國絕對必需的要素，而且必須國民全體的協力愛護，乃有堅實的保證。惟有統一的國家，纔能眞正獲勝利的成果；叭有統一的國家，纔能順利推行　政，保障民主制度，發揚民意，集中民國，完成建國的大計，也唯有統一的國家，繼能順利推行各種經濟的建設，提高我們一般勤勞辛苦同胞的生活水準。更唯有統一的國家，纔能於戰後的新世界中，為人類和平福祉而有所貢獻。而且就當前事實來說，我們更唯有共同維護國家的統一，纔能碸進行我們的復員工作。否則，如果軍令政令不能統一，交通運輸節節破壞，地主秩序到處騷擾，則國家的復員工作，必是處處受着阻撓，而人民最基本安居樂業的要求，根本就無從談起。所以我們對於國家政事，無不可以處心忍讓，無不可以推誠相與，而軍令政令的必須統一，軍隊必須一律歸屬國家統轄，任何割據地盤，破壞交通，阻礙復員的軍事行動，必須絕對避免，則是解決目前紛爭不安的唯一先決條件。這是事實，也是眞理。凡有愛國良知的人士，所不能不承認，不能不履行的。</p>
<h3>今年的兩大任務　　要完成復員計劃實施憲政</h3>
<p>明白了這一個重要前提以後，我要為我同胞提出我們政府今年急須致國的兩項任務。</p>
<p>第一，我們要完成復員計劃，解除民眾痛苦，以確立建設的基礎。所以一方面要首先恢覆交通，使人民得以還鄉，物資得以暢通，而後經濟建設的工作，得以開展。一方面要收束軍事，普遍解除日軍的武裝，遣送俘虜回歸日本，切實整編軍隊，儘速恢復地方安寧秩序，禁止　民惡霸的榨取，壓迫，使人民得以安居樂業。唯有如此，而後人民的生命財產，得有保障，復興建國的事業，得以進行，纔可以安慰抗戰中受苦受　流血殘廢的軍民，與犧牲殉職先烈的英靈。</p>
<p>第二，我們要儘速實現民主憲政，憲政於民，造成全民的政治。關於這一點，我們政府的宣示，已不止一次了。我們國民革命的最終目的，是全民政治，而召開國民大會，選政於民，是唯一必經的建國程序。我在去年元旦，曾經宣示，國民大會可不待戰事結束而提先如今，在去年三月一日，我又向憲政實施協進會正式宣布，定於去年十一月十二日召集。後來因為　軍參政會與各黨派的意見，協議召開國民大會的辦法，不幸又遭遇各種的阻碍，以致不得不延展會期。於是國民政府乃明令改期於本年五月五日召集，這一件重大而且必需的　　，實在是萬萬不能再緩了。政府為使抗戰後的民意得以　　表　　　，準備增加國民大會代表的名額，使社會　　和各黨派人士，共同參加於國民大會。現在距各國民大會召開日期，只有五月，政府為進一步促成國內環境的安定，為實現全國的精誠團結，為使政治中　成為更充實而有力的機構，在國民大會召開以前，如準備延　社會賢　與各黨派人士來參加政府，不論是參加決定政策的會議機關，或是參加執行政策的行政機關，政府本於天下為公，先賢任能的原則無不竭誠接納以期集思廣益。而我們政府，於此所希望的，並無其他條件，祇是參加政府的各黨派，不能擁有其自主的軍隊，來作政爭的工具。這因為一個國家以內，如果容許有國軍以外的軍隊，無異這成國家以內的另一個國家。則國家即不能統一在一個政府之下。如果存在着兩種性質不同命令，各別的軍隊，則政府必不能健仝政治不能　其合作團結健全而有力了。有一於此，不僅隨時可促政府於分屬，更足以促使國家於危亡，這是無論為國家統一計，為政治合作計，都是事實上所不可空話的。我們今天為了國家，為了人民，　必須披肝裂膽，同德同心，做到澈底的合作，而不是形式的合作。最重要的一點，就是決不能使國家降於無秩序無政府的狀態，使政府成為不能負責的政府，我們中國在抗戰期中，還有國軍以外的自主軍隊，已是國家莫大的恥辱和損失。現在抗戰已吿勝利，亟須造成和平安定的環境，集中一國力量，來開始建國的工作。所以政府對政治必盡　開放，對民主必提前實現，　全國軍隊，必須統轄於國家，聽命於政府，實在是眞正愛國愛民的人士所應該　　　心，即促其質行的。</p>
<p>行政院例會　改二日在渝舉行　「中央社重試卅一日電」行政院本週例會，仍決定在　舉行，原定開會時間為星期二上午九時，是日適値元旦，全國休假一天，故必於星期三（二日）舉行。</p>
<p>蔣主席召見　赴　代表團「中央社重慶卅日電」蔣主席卅召見赴　代表團，有所訓示。</p>
<h3>望明辨是非利害　把握此千載一時建設良機</h3>
<p>上面所說的，乃是我們政府今年努力的方針。我們認為戰後人民的困苦。成不可再使加深。國家的基礎，萬不能稍有動搖。勝利的成果，萬不能稍有破壞。復員建設的工作，萬不能再有積延，所以，我們必將不餘任何容忍，以維護國內的和平；必將不惜任何努力，以恢復社會的秩序；必將不避任何障礙，艱難，以促成民主憲政的如期實話必將用一切可能的和平方法，以解決國內任何的紛爭。除了革命的責任不能放棄，國家的統一不容損害，根本大法不容變更政府基礎不容搖動以外，其他無不可以容忍，無不可以協商。務望我全體同胞，認清是非，明辨利害，痛念我中國百年以來國勢阽危，民族衰弱的痛苦，屈辱，省悟我民族千載一進復興建國的良機不可再得，根據事實洞察，終始自然，不致為流言所煽惑，而動搖其對於國事前途的信心，放棄其對於國家民族的天職。我懇切盼望我全國同胞，一方面要對於復員，對於民主，對於實行在三民主義的建設，務必竭盡力量，負責盡職，挺身奮起，以促其成功；同時要擁護政府實行民主統一政策，監督政府一切軍政的措施，檢舉貪污不法的官吏，清除積弊，滌蕩貪污，使國家眞正走上和平建設的軌道。</p>
<p>中正追隨國父，致力革命，志在拯救國族，裁抑強權。對內維護國家的統一，對外求取世界的和平。此身貢獻國家，生死成敗，早已置之度外。現在抗戰勝利，素願已遂，個人的得失榮辱，更是無所容心。我個人今日已別無所求，只希望全國同胞，對於國事，認識前途的艱辛，覺悟責任的重大，人人皆以昨死今生昨非信是的精誠，共同一致，起而負責，使五十餘年國民革命的成績，有所繼承，十四年軍民艱苦奮鬥犧牲，不致虛擲。本年五月，即將召開國民大會，實施憲政，以達成我們選政於民實現全民政治的願望。國家休戚興亡，與世界安危禍福的重大責任，即將交付於我們全體國民。深望我親愛的全體同胞，及時奮發，積極準備，以承受這一個神聖艱鉅的責任。我們今後究竟是完成國民革命的全功，實現三民主義的建設呢？還是使革命抗戰功虧一簣呢？是否能確保國家重蹈民國初年的覆轍，自陷於分崩離析的絕境呢？是否眞能獨立自由三民主義的民國初年的覆轍，自陷於分崩離析的絕境呢？是否能建設中國為一個眞正獨立自由三民主義的國家呢？還是願意蒙受百年來次殖民地的恥辱呢？是否眞能達成民族的解放呢？還是仍舊不免於危機相乘再受痛苦和壓迫呢？是否要我們中國成為支持世界和平的主要因素呢？還是任令中國成為國際上共棄的落伍者呢？這副重大的担子，就要落在全國同胞的肩上。中國兩運盛衰榮枯，　子孫的安危禍福，在實施憲政以後，將不僅由中國國民政府來抵當，而是要全國同胞作國家眞正的主人翁的來決定。現在距離五月，為時不久，所以中正要乘此時機，諄諄囑咐，紀要使我們政府還政於民的志愿，以及國父實現三民主義完成全民政治的願望，能為國家的將來，造成永久的幸福，這是我們全體同胞所應該及時黽勉的。</p>
<h3>我們要共同歡呼　以迎接勝利實行全民政治</h3>
<p>全國同胞們！我們經此抗戰，國家元氣已經凋喪，建國工作已經耽誤，我們要環顧今日的世界是怎麼樣突飛猛進的世界，時代是怎麼樣飛躍進步的時代，我們中國百事落後，要想立足於現代世界之林，需要有怎麼樣迎頭趕上的努力。回溯近百年的歷史，國家是處於次殖民地的地位，人民是處于奴隸牛馬非人生活之中，經甲午戰敗之役，庚於拳匪之亂，幾乎使國家陷於萬劫不復的境地。幸有我國父起而領導革命，全國同胞一致追隨，共同努力，到了這次抗戰勝利，國家乃因不平等條約的廢除，而　得獨立平等的地位，民族也得到了解放與自由。而我盟幫又是竭誠協助我國的復興，這種機會，眞是史無前例。這一個復興建設的良機，可說是千載一時，稍縱即逝，萬萬不可再有蹉跎以自誤。我們百廢待舉，全賴我同胞特別刻苦節　勤勞奮勉，人人明禮義，知廉恥，事事負責任，守紀律，而後我們的經濟建設，和其他建國工作，纔能夠如計劃進行。我們收復區的一切復興的計劃，纔能夠順利實施。我們抗戰以來，　多少軍民先烈，為戰爭而犧牲他們的生命。他們已不及親覩勝利，而我們乃能目擊五十年來國恥的湔雪，和國運的昭蘇，實在是人生的至幸。全體同胞們：我今天以熱烈的心情，祝賀你們的幸福！我同時要以「自求多福」與「自助人助」的箴言，作為我個人贈送你們新年的禮物。我深切期望你們以興奮積極的精神，承受這一個戰後建設無比艱鉅的工作。全體同胞們：我們要共同歡呼，迎接抗戰勝利，完成復員建設，鞏固國家統一，實行全民政治，三民主義萬歲！中華民國萬歲！（完）</p>

<h3>蘇軍二月一日前　自東北省撤退　經貝爾納斯演說予以證實</h3>
<p>〔合家社華盛頓卅一日電〕美國務卿貝爾納斯本日在廣播演說中稱：蘇聯準備於二月一日自東北各省撤退其軍隊之說，在莫斯科三國外長會議中已獲證實，貝氏謂莫斯科會議對於不干涉中國政策加以確定，並謂該會議決定之方案，足爲「美駐華特使馬歇爾將軍之有價値支援」。此外貝氏對於三國會議管制日本之協定，亦加以辯護」。</p>
<p>美國務卿播詞</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓卅一日電〕美國務卿貝爾納斯昨晚向美國人民廣播演說，報告莫斯科會議情形，謂莫斯科會議所成立之各種協定及諒解，完全顧到中國利益。中國於五國外長會議，遠東委員會，四國管制日本委員會，朝鮮臨時政府組織及託管制，均各參加，惟中國若因內社分裂，將不能在聯合國中佔有適當地位，以合法履行其國際責任。杜魯門總統最近宣布之對華政策，莫斯科會議中亦曾加以討論。聯合各國對於此項政策，意見一致。三國政府均承認中國應停止內爭，由各黨各派擴大參加國民政府，並重申遵守不千涉中國內政之政策。莫洛托夫曾與予討論美蘇兩國在華軍隊問題。蘇聯按照中蘇協定，擬在二月一日以前，自東九省撤兵。華北美軍則俠日軍繳械遣送回國，或中國能不藉美國援助而自行完成此項工作時，即行撤退。三强於對華政策成立諒解，亦可助馬歇爾將軍履行其所負之使命。</p>
<p>對韓國問題</p>
<p>與臨時政府合作</p>
<p>或母需實行託管</p>
<p>對於朝鮮問題，貝氏則稱：美蘇聯合委員會與朝鮮臨時民主政府合作，或可發覺其毋需實行托管。我人之目標，即在加速使朝鮮成爲聯合國獨立會員之日期。朝鮮管理政府曾試擬解決此項問題　聯合委員會將向美英蘇中建議成立一朝鮮臨時民主政府，特將就四國託管制向各該國政府建議準備朝鮮於五年內獨立</p>
<p>訂和平條約</p>
<p>蘇對美已行讓步</p>
<p>參加者皆可與會</p>
<p>貝氏又透露倫敦五國外長會議障礙之一，爲蘇聯堅持和平條約，僅由簽訂停戰條約之主要各國擬訂，而其他代表則謂凡曾積極參戰之國家，皆可參與和平會議。此事在倫敦未能成立協定，因此多有以倫敦會議爲完全失敗者，然在莫斯科協定已適應美國所堅持之主張，凡曾參戰者皆可參與和平會議，並經明白承認谷大國於構成和約之負責地位。此次協定爲和平條件首由簽訂停戰協定之主要各國起草，惟於草就以後，應立即提交美英蘇法中五國召集之和平會議，此五國組成外長會議，且爲聯合國機構安全理事會之常任委員。凡曾積極參加戰爭之國家，均將請其出席和平會議，此會議應在明年五月一日以前召集之。</p>
<p>美遠東政府</p>
<p>在造成和平條件</p>
<p>與盟國取得合作</p>
<p>美國遠東政策造成可以維持永久和平之條件，而與盟國合作，實爲此項政策之主要部份。美國於打倒日本雖獨任艱鉅，但常以對日戰爭爲對軸心國戰爭之一部份，故自始即擬以管制日本爲聯合國共負之責任，早在本年八月二十日，即邀請中英蘇三國與美國共同實行波茨坦宣言及日本投降條件，遠東顧問委員會雖於十月間成立，惟英國對於其顧問性質從事保留，蘇聯又花參加委員會工作前，請對東京管制機構，有所決定，美英蘇三國政府在莫斯科會議時，徵得中國同意，承認設立遠東委員會，此委員會將由中，美，英，蘇，法，荷蘭，澳洲，紐西蘭，加拿大，印度及菲律濱等國代表組織，貝氏力言遠東委員會及管制日本委員會之設立，對於麥帥行政方針並無東縛。美國在構成政策方面，仍居首要地位。遠東委員會有權擬訂管制日本之原則，其決定可包括在美國最高統帥指令中，對日政策雖須　得三强同意，然其基本政策，非經美國同意，不能實行，美國於遠東委員會成立任何協定之前，對一切緊急事件，可以自由頒發臨時指令。預料美國藉此項臨時權力所處理者，僅有下列三問題：（一）投降條件內所定管制日本方法之變更，（二）日本憲法機構之根本政策：（三）日本整個政府之變更。</p>
<p>原子彈問題</p>
<p>技術方面未討論</p>
<p>蘇政府亦未詢及</p>
<p>對於原子能問題，據貝氏宣稱：三國外長關於原子能之討論，僅以英美提議由聯合國設立管理委員會爲限。至於技術方面或科學方面之事，均未暇討論，蘇聯政府亦未詢及此項新兵器，貝氏對於一九四六年五月一日以前召集二十一國和平會議之協定，謂美國堅持凡曾積極參戰之國家，均應參加和平會議。關於羅馬尼亞及保加利亞兩國擴大政府，以取得英美承認一項協定。貝氏並未完全表示滿意，但希望兩國政府能於實質上改善其「民主性質」，伊朗問題未能成立協定，貝氏亦並不失望。</p>

<h3>向日本菲律賓兩地人民　麥統帥新歲獻辭　日人已獲解放今後宜好自爲之　勗菲人緊密團結努力戰後復興</h3>

<p>〔聯合社東京卅一日電〕在動盪混亂中，理想之新日本將於來年促其實現；惟日本人民猶茫然不知彼等應作何事。世界各國咸盼日本迅速改革，早獲成績，未免期望過殷，結果恐難令滿意。但手忙脚亂，躊躇猶疑，幾經錯誤之後，總可漸漸進步，使由變相之封建制度，過渡至民主範疇。其藍本今已交諸日本領袖。此項措置將在當有戲劇性之背景中完成。茲試舉其犖犖大者，如二月中將開始審訊主要戰犯，糧食匱乏，將日益深刻，通貨膨脹與罪行之增加，（此在四月中將達頂點）以及聯合國之管東等皆是。日本並非一民主國家，即至目前亦尚無變爲民主國家之準備，但與數月前之日本比較，則已面目大變，蓋顯有若干重要基本變化，惟革新工作尚在發端中。數月之前，盟軍壓境，日本臣民惴惴　等候日皇廣播命令與盟軍背城一戰，作最後衝殺。驕橫之領袖，在國內益厲行統制，益蓋誇稱日軍所據有之大帝國，並不洩露此帝國已經片片碎裂，宣傳家尚　續在報章中煊染西方人之野蠻。及至力竭屈服，眞相大白，遂舉國充滿憤恨，恰如行近懸崖之人，驚而却步。戰爭狂者，一旦幻夢破裂，均噤若寒蟬，人民則公開斥責其向日所信從之領袖，而投向戰勝之聯合國。故美軍進佔之後，並未遭遇游擊職事，而反獲得解放者之稱譽。日人且發現易與美國人相處，而美國人所携來者爲舒適平安，八年黑暗困苦，使其亟圖歡笑，以忘前事。故美日人之親善，日見普遍。且日本民情已根本改變，雖猶竭力反對日皇遜位，但最近麥帥令廢神道國敎，不啻直接侵害皇室地位，人民亦未嘗有間言。加於若干星期前提議及此，尚將招致日人無聲之反抗，今則連日皇地位亦已成公開討論之政治問題，不復干犯禁律。據時事新聞社稱：日本興論對日皇問題，可歸爲三類：（一）無條件支持日皇制；（二）主張君位立憲，日皇雖繼續在任，但其特權減小，（三）贊成廢除日島，建立共和國。事實上在日本戰後所興之許多政黨中，除共產黨外，俱主張保留日皇，惟共產黨獨主廢除君主。關於此問題，當作過許多次公衆測騐，大都非缺乏系統，即受騐者爲公衆中不重要部分，惟測騐結果，莫不關示相反意見，同時並存。東京帝大之社會硏究學會，曾就帝大學生一三一人測騐，結果贊成保留日皇而加以部分變革者，佔百分之四十，保留而加以根本改革者佔百分之三十五，謂日皇不應加以議論者佔百分之十二，主張完全廢除者佔百分之六，其餘不表示意見云。</p>
<h3>尼赫魯預言　未來大戰　東方民族運動澎湃　非原子彈所能鎮壓</h3>
<p>〔路透社賴普泰娜亞琴賽三十一日電〕印度國大黨領袖之一尼赫魯，今日在此主持全印土邦人民大會（印度酋長統治各邦人民擁護大會黨政策之機構）中致詞，預料亞洲將有千萬人民奮起反抗，從而釀成第三次世界大戰。赫氏述及東南亞洲及印度尼西亞稱：英國現正從事必將失敗之戰役，其實力來源漸見枯竭，此乃益形明顯之事。就近來發展觀之，美國竟容許此種行動，對於有關各方，實有極嚴重之後果。因亞洲各國次不願受任何帝國之統治，必將起而反抗之，且係千萬人民之不斷反抗，其熱情縱以原子炸彈亦不能鎭壓之，由此反抗，更將釀成可怖之第三次世界大戰。試觀英國干涉印度尼西亞之戰事，與義德干涉西班牙之戰事，實極類似，而西班牙戰事，乃第二次世界大戰之先謦也，吾人月繫印度軍被利用，從事英國之卑汚工作，而與吾人之友作戰，實不勝憤恨與愧恧。赫氏末稱：印度現將有偉大之發展，各士邦在印度境內充任英方「第五縱隊」，已歷一百五十年，今當明暸偉大之變動必然到來，各酋畏不能長此仰仗外國之保護云。</p>
<h3>加强革命力量　越南各黨團結　一切問題交國民大會解決</h3>
<p>〔中央社河內廿七日電〕（遲到）越南獨立同盟會與越南革命同盟會與越南國民黨，前以政見不同，時有磨擦。月來三黨領袖爲加强革命力量，曾數度會商團結辦法，經會議後，聯名簽署發表聲明團結一致，一切問題交一月六日選出之國民大會解決，定一月一日改組之臨時政府爲聯合臨時政府，由各黨共同參加。至國民大會後再組織新越南政府。</p>
<h3>聯合國大會　佈置開會事宜　六國小組赴美</h3>
<p>〔合衆社倫敦卅一日電〕六國小組委會，將於星期四離此前往美國，內有中國代表一人，該委員會赴美目的，爲擇定聯合國組織之永久會址。莫斯科三國外長會議之圓滿結束，使明年開始之聯合國會議更多成功希望。關於聯合國大會及出代表二千人赴會之佈置行將就緒。</p>
<h3>心臟移植試驗成功</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦三十一日電〕莫斯科電台今日廣播稱：蘇聯靑年生物學家薛尼辛，前會以蛙等試騐心臟移植，獲得成功。今又以兩顆心臟，移植一頭禽默之體內，結果圓滿。據薛氏稱，」余實騐室中，現有兩顆心臟之暖血禽獸，情形頗佳。余在初步試騐時，以第二顆心臟置於頸皮之下，移植雖成功，禽歟則因溫度關係，不能長久生存。茲余已發現移置第二顆心臟之更穩妥塲所，即除去一肺，換置一心，可分主要心臟之勞。」電台又稱，病人患心臟衰弱症者，若移植第二顆心臟，即可避免血液停止，因而挽救病人之生命。</p>
<h3>希特勒遺囑　第二部份發表</h3>
<p>〔聯合社紐倫堡卅日電〕希特勒遺囑第二部份，今日由聯合國當局發表，證明戈林及希姆萊於戰爭來期因與敵人談判，被希特勒免職。遺囑內稱，「戈林與希姆萊私通敵國，陰謀篡國，不僅矢忠於余，且使國家及民族蒙辱」。同時英國及德國諜報官亦宣布，在罕福特發現希特勒遺囑附件，由故宣傳部長郭培爾草擬，日期爲一九四一年四月二十九日午前五時三十分，在希特勒遺囑草成後半小時，僅簽「郭培爾博士」字樣。郭培爾於附件中決定尊重希特勒所頒離開柏林，就任新政府總理之命令，希特勒相信新政府可以作戰到底。並稱「處此危急之秋，元首被叛逆所包團，故至少應有一部份人對元首效忠到底死而後已」。希特勒於遺囑第一部份則宣布，余所有一切，無論價値如何，均贈予國社黨，黨如不存，贈諸國家，若國復摧殘，則余無再行可囑之必要。余所藏繪實，非爲私人計，實欲在多瑙河畔故鄉林茲城設立畫廊，以供同好。</p>
<h3>納粹衝鋒隊軍官　霍孟執行絞刑</h3>
<p>〔聯合社瑪登乃克三十日電〕據衝鋒隊軍官霍夫孟，因前在國社黨集中營內辦理火葬塲，判處死刑，已於今日在觀衆二萬人之前絞斃，霍氏直至最後猶自稱無罪。其絞刑架即設在火葬塲中，聯合國及波蘭人屍體在此焚化者甚多，據證人供述，且曾親見霍氏將新生嬰兒投入爐中。</p>
<p>〔聯合社敦敦三十日電〕莫斯科今日廣播：納粹戰犯倍恩哈特中將·哈門中將·及倫勒伍長，曾在勃里安斯克犯戰爭罪，由當地軍事法庭判處絞刑，四小時後即予執行。</p>
<h3>國際點滴</h3>
<p>蘇聯自一月一日起廢止一切戰時稅。</p>
<p>新加坡英國軍政府公務員一萬一千人，要求加俸，罷工三星期，已允卅一日復工。</p>
<p>政府下令驅逐自稱德國人民之史華比人約四十三萬名，所有財產一概不准携取。</p>
<h3>莫斯科會議後　世界政局動向　美對管制日本問題讓步　博取蘇聯附和對華政策</h3>
<p>〔路透倫敦卅一日電〕倫敦觀察報華盛頓特派員稱：國務卿員爾納斯欲博取參院好感，但蘇聯之參加對日本之管制，常爲其示大之阻礙，協定之中，此乃不能完全了解之一部。對日本之管制，其每日之行政雖無阻礙，蘇聯對於日本之復興工作，雖有否決之權，然而變更之處亦已不少，此等均須加以檢討，美國於此當可使用其否決權。史達林此次之允許結束朝鮮之現狀，並重申附和對華之政策，皆因獲得對管制日本之讓步之故。朝鮮之美蘇佔領區其間並無連繫存在。外界所獲悉者僅爲關於沒收與混亂之報告，至於中國方面，東北蘇軍之撤退當已無問題，蘇聯對於延安亦無多大興趣，使中國統一之問題當由美國駐華特使馬歇爾將軍一手辦理。莫斯科公報之未提伊朗及韃靼尼爾問題，殊令人感覺詫異。土耳其以其在戰時所採熊度之關係，未能博得較大之同情，蘇聯之向土發動神經戰，泰半亦因於此，蘇聯之行動雖不適合時宜，然而評論猶不多見。至於伊朗問題則較爲不同，德黑蘭協定已岌岌可危，有謂解決伊蘇問題之最佳辦法，即爲促進英美蘇三國之合作，以開發伊朗境內之油田。</p>
<h3>關懷伊士局勢　英國孤掌難鳴</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦三十一日電〕倫敦外交記者稱：倫敦對於士耳其及伊朋之局勢，正寄予莫大之關切。當貝文外相啟程赴莫斯科，深頤得使伊朗閣員有列席之權然而結果伊總理及外長並未獲得前往蘇京之便利。今伊朗境內之美軍幾已全部退出，而蘇聯在伊朗之用意又欠明朗，故英國在伊朗殊有孤掌難鳴之勢。再就土耳其而言，對土之神經戰旣不能削弱土政府之控制權，亦未見在卡爾斯及阿特漢發見自治運動，而土耳其之人民反而益趨團結，以爲政府後盾。蘇聯或不致强行奪取所要求之士地。但如亦聯繼續行使間接之要求，而土耳其又絕不屈服，則前途之發展如何亦難以預料。</p>

<h3>運用和平手腕方式　促成統一民主中國</h3>
<p>今天是中華民國三十五年的元旦，也是全國人民　　了八年英勇抗戰獲得最後勝利以後的第一個新年，全國人民痛定思痛，在此新年歡謌載舞富中，應確切認識戰後世界給予中國的重大責任，以及中國所有肩　　重大責任之道，進而　　　力，使我具有光榮歷史的中華民族得與世界列強并駕齊驅，永奠人　和平進步之基礎。</p>
<p>去年十二月十五日，美國杜　門總統，在美特使馬歇爾元帥來華啟程時，發表一道美國對華政策聲明，堅決地說明美國政府深信聯合國組織之成功，與世界和平之保障，均擊於中華民國之強盛統一與民主。美國政府此種堅定信心，不僅代表美國人民的意見，即世界遠見有識之士，亦所同感，強盛統一與民主的中國，實為今後我國人民共同努力，以求達到之最偉大崇高的目標。</p>
<p>蓋抗戰最後勝利，日本帝國消滅之後，阻碍中國強盛的惟一因素，業已消滅。今後中國，必須富強，始克盡其對戰後世界和平所該擔當的重大責任。</p>
<p>然所謂強盛的中國，不僅言乎軍備，而尤重在現代政治，經濟，社會，文化諸方面之建設，必具備現代國家的條件，足與世界潮流齊頭同進，始能達到強盛的地位。現代強盛的國家，必先達到統一，安定，而國內問題，尤其是政治問題，能以和平合理方法，平等協商方式，求得圓滿解決。過去藉革命手段以爭奪政權，或恃武力以謀統一的時代，均已成不適時勢之歷史陳跡，因此利用下力在國內作戰，不論稱為內亂，或認為戡亂，均為國家民族落後的表示。</p>
<p>杜魯門總統聲明中謂：世界任何一隅之頓足不前遭受破壞，即足以成不勢之威脅整個世界的和平。中國如因內政問題，而發生戰亂，即直接威脅世界的安定與和平，因此中國國內能否和平，已為世界一大問題。戰後世界已不容許中國之自相殘殺，我全國人民應痛切認識：欲求國家統一，尤其是要求民主政治，絕不應再事迷信武力，而應循政治協商的方式，民主和平的大道，以勇毅前進。</p>
<p>自去年八月六日美國對日本投擲原子彈之後，世界和科學家們均認為人類歷史已進入了原子力的新時代。人類若能以原子分裂而發出的力量，利用於戰爭，則極短的時間內，便可使世界人類毀滅，如以之用於和平建設，則人類生活便可進入於優裕至不可思議的境地。</p>
<p>不幸中國少數落後人士，卻有一極錯誤心理，彼等以為現在中國國力尚未建設成功，以本國單獨之力量，不足以對付第二第三個強國，幻想利用列強時間的磨擦衝突，甚或發生第三次戰爭，中國即可投機利用。此種心理錯誤落後，危險極大，蓋列強中今日力能對立搞衡者，只有美國和蘇聯。假如美蘇之間眞有不能和解的衝突，而致戰爭，則叛國必使用原子彈，以求迅速結束戰爭，但亦無人能保證，蘇聯不會同時利用原子彈，以為報復。美蘇衝突戰爭，如　涉及中國間　在內，則中國當不免亦　捲入漩渦。果如是，則中國將怎麼應付，故為中國計，為世界計，此種錯誤危險心理，必須消除。中國今後建國，必須努力於爭取國內與國際之和平，始為上策。</p>
<p>尤有進者：強盛、統一、民主三者，有其絕不可分性，而民主乃為強盛與統一之重要先決條件。中國民　政治不黽實現，民主制度不能建立，則眞正持久之強盛、統一、使無由獲致，我們所自求與世界所冀　者，乃建基於民主的強盛統一之中國，如僅求強盛與統一，則不求民主建設，則德日兩國可為前車之鑒。</p>
<p>因此，戰勝的民主國家，要求中國強盛統一，同時，更要求中國民主，以避免德日的覆轍，不希望中國成為第二個日本，成為世界的新威脅。今後吾人建國目標，必先完成民權主義的建設，使人民對國家政治有充份的自由，來發表意見及決定政策的機會　　茲　歲，全國人民對杜魯門總統對華政策　明，應切實體會，一致接受，努力求其實現，用種種和平方法手段，促進國家之強盛統一與民主，這個目的，為戰後世界對中國的要求，給予中國的責任，亦吾人今後建國之惟一目標，我希望全國有政治主張的人士，都能深切了解，以最大決心堅持此種方針，確以達到三民主義為本國幸福，為世界和平而建國的目的。吾為此敬祝我中華民國國運永昌，中國人民福祉無疆！</p>
<h3>祝勝利新年　寄無窮希望</h3>
<p>— 何應欽</p>
<p>今天是抗戰勝利後首次烈到的新元旦，全國各地熱欣慶祝的情緒，廻與往日不同。陷區同胞，在八年壓迫下得到了解放遇失去了五十年的台灣。亦重回祖國懷抱，自然都更歡，鼓舞。在這迎接歲序除準備新的時候，我們瞻念前途，固學希望無窮，但一回想到八年來聽險阻艱辛，軍民犧牲的滲　重大，以及國家一切的損失，及盟邦有力的援助，我們首先要追念和感謝為國犧牲的官兵和同胞，以及援助我們的盟邦，尤其是美國，英國，和蘇聯，更想到勝利獲得的非易，和今後建國事業的艱鉅，又會深感今後吾人責任之重大而益　警惕。</p>
<p>我們回溯這慘痛的歷史眞足以發人深省，假定民國成立以後沒有軍閥割據，北伐完成之後全國能一致團結，努力建國工作，那麼有了辛亥到七七廿餘年的時間，依照　國父的建國大綱，我們由軍政而而訓政，由訓政而憲政，老早已完成民主政治，而且有這二十餘年的時間，國防建設，至少也可具規模，日本那裏還敢來欺　我們，侵略我們呢？簡單的說：就是因為國家沒有統一，不能建設圖強，才會遭受侵略，今天我們痛定思痛，實在覺得我們國家的建設，不能再有一天的躭延遲誤，換言之：國家現在所急切需要的，是眞正的統一，惟有眞正的統一了，才談得上民主。</p>
<p>有的人以為中國之不能統一，是由於沒有實行民主政治，這種見解完全是因果倒置，試問國家若是不統一，而有割據分裂的現象，甚至以武力為割據的工具和後盾，眞正的民意被割據勢力所控制把持，　是欲求解放而不可得。那裏還有什麼民主呢？世界上無論那一種政體的國家，絕對只有一個發號施令的政府，來　澈軍令政令的實施，各個政黨，雖在義會傳開指摘政府的缺點，但一切老師以國家民族及人民的利益為前提，以眞理為依歸，絕沒有除了中央政府而外，還有另一個政府存在的，也沒有一個國家的軍隊，不服從中央政府命令的。英美蘇聯都是民主政治的國家，但是他們的人民都能忠愛國家，他們的軍隊都能絕對服從政府的命令，人人都能犧牲個人的利益，乃至生命，來謀國家的福利，所以能戰勝德國。假若他們是四分五裂，命令不行，試問如何能戰勝德國？所以我們要實現眞正的民主政治，也必須要國家眞正的統一。</p>
<p>全國各地同胞受八年戰爭的影響，尤其是陷區的同胞，直接受到日軍和漢奸的壓榨剝削，生活困苦達於極點，此乃三月來，視察各地所親見，我國一般同胞的生活，原來就很艱苦，現在更是不堪設想，所以今後我們不僅要使同胞們八年來的創傷，早日恢復，還要逐漸提高全國同胞的生活水準，使人人對於衣食住行樂，都得到合理的解決，但是到今天，日本投降已逾四月，而一部份的同胞，因為交通之破壞和治安秩序之尚未恢復，連想回家鄉都不可能，那裏談得到提高生活水準？這是國家還有不統一的現象存在的原故。所以我們要恢復同胞們八年來的創傷，要謀提高同胞們的生活水準，也必須要國家眞正的統一。</p>
<p>現在，抗戰獲得了勝利，正是我們國家民族建設復興最好的機會，假如我們把這復興的機會放過，不能集中意志力量來完成統一建國的工作，則國家終不免再被外人的輕視，乃至再被侵略，而永無　身之日。在這新歲開始的時候，我們全國同胞應該痛下決心，人人勿抱怎麼自利的觀念，一德一心，精誠團結，本着「國家至上」，「民族至上」的原則，把國家興亡之責，放在自己肩上，尤其是全國軍隊的官兵，要明瞭保國衛民責任之重大，大家一致來促進統一，維護統一，鞏固統一，大家一致來努力於國家的建設，民主的實現，和人民生活水準的提高。我們慶祝　勝利的新年，並對國家的前途，寄予無窮的希望。</p>

<h3>三十五年元旦獻辭</h3>
<p>今日何日？非中華民國三十五年之聚旦乎？非抗戰勝利以還首次遭逢歲序之更新乎？陽光乍啟，百絢閃呈。華離破碎之殷憂，已隨陳舊之年月而就渺。卓越穎異之希望，方挾新生之機能以俱來。人人以上中無不有此憧憬，即人人意念中無不有此嶄求。執一而詢之，則百口僉同。情有必至，理所固然也。吾儕報人，職司喉舌，第値年歷回換，例有獻歲之詞。然其意義之深遠，情緒之奔放，要未有如茲之甚者。何則？過去八年之抗戰，亦旣創鉅而痛深矣。敵寇蹂躪，廻軼尋常。千百萬謹愿循良之眾，橫受其奴役非刑之慘，或則摩頂放踵，櫻鋒鏑而靡悔，或則顛沛流離，遂載胥以及溺。此中荼酷，寧待深論？迨夫局勢驟更，魔障倐滅，由於蔣主席堅毅不屈之領導終能獲致最後勝利之標的，宜乎薄海歡騰，舉國之若狂矣。唯當吾人今日屬筆之頃，覺猶有若干閃爍之陰影，　掠於腦際，有幾許辛酸之意味，廻盡乎胸中。精神之失調歟？人謀之不　歟？孰主宰是？蓋難言之。殆如惡夢乍醒，餘悸猶滯，偶逢怫逆，即生嗔安。拔除不祥之已事，珍重今後之前途，闡揚蕩滌，茲為造端。敢藉時會，一　殷願。</p>
<p>自日本軍閥以其八絃一宇之野心，抱吞噬亞洲之迷夢，　于所　，殃與禍會。德意兩國，臭味相投，東西相應，於是以軸民為號召，作孤注之一擲。而彌天烽煙，無可收拾矣。頻年戰事損失之所　及，殆非通常數字得能估計。蓋不但文化摧毀，生靈涂炭而已。波流所屆，直令世界有陸沉之厄，人類與殄瘁之嗟。謂為　古奇災，要非過論。然而事實之所昭示，黷武恣肆者終必有自斃之日，輔持正義者，遂能操勝利之劵。巨慗已殲，康寧可期。英美之與蘇聯，客觀主義，容有不同，而民主精神，宜無二貫。方謂懲前毖後，三強間必有更密切之合作，而倫敦五長會議，忽吿頓失傳，訛言蔚起，揣測紛紜一時陰　，又復籠罩。所以然者何？法西之餘孽，剗除未盡，盟國之本身，團結不堅耳。唯其剗孽不盡，故難免有蟄伏潛滋之輩，竊發以圖一逞。唯其團結不堅，故授人以抵罅蹈隙之機，受算而不自覺。星星之火，可以燎原。抱杞憂者，豈止少數？猶幸莫斯科三國會議，迅能成立協定，以澄清兩月來密雲不雨之混沌局面，自茲以往，能以更和諧之精神，謀更團結之合作，捐棄私見，披瀝誠意，務使人寰慘禍，宇宙浩劫，不再顯現於目前，且永絕於今后。吾人所馨香　祝者，此其一。</p>
<p>民國自肇建以來，軍閥稱亂，內戰頻仍。國人厭苦怨慰之深，每懷時日曷喪之詛。迨北伐底定，全國統一，各地民眾，始稍稍有生業之樂。其後日寇憑陵，兵連禍結，八年來鐵蹄所布，幾遍朔南。於斯時際，人民雖備受煎迫艾刈之苦，家破人亡之痛，而從無一人不視抗戰之勝利者，足知民意向背，認識極清，外侮所宜必禦，固不能與　墻之爭等量而齊觀也。今於無所斷喪之餘，瘡痍滿目這地，忽復有內亂兵爭之醞釀。黃臺之瓜，豈堪再摘？無怪舉國人士，疾首慼額，奔走駭吿，斷斷然引為不可也。原夫同根所生之胞與，同氣相求之物類，有融通之情調無不解之冤結，何至必以兵戎相見，始為最後解決之途？煮豆然其之呤，尺布斗粟之謠，昔人之所深恫，今日可為殷鑒。廼者政治協商會議，召開在邇，朝野要人，列坐一堂，預計諸般錯綜糾紛之問題，不難於從容討論下，得合理之部署，而人民惶惑之情緒，當可消弭於無形。是為我政府當局最賢明之措置，亦即獻歲發祥最優惠之禮品。尤冀此後各黨各派，集中意見，互求諒解，益堅共推誠相與之信念，避免無謂之猜忌，以共策國家戰後之復興，奠定民生穩當之基礎。吾人所殷切祈求者，此其二。</p>
<p>貪污之必宜消滅，已為人人共稔之事實，而公務人員之以氣　陵人者，亦殊非民治國家應有之現象，當確切予以糾正或懲戒。我國一般之國民性，向以循良愿　著稱，然亦有其甚大之弱點，即不能自堅其　志，每易為環境所支配，或忽視本身之力量，好以依附為得計。故方其為平民時，畏見官府，憚於爭論，即有橫逆之來，唯以忍受為主，一旦得勢力之憑籍，亦寖思運用其威福，所謂一行作吏，面目全非，求之今日，固比比然也。日前，蔣主席巡視故都，許人民投訴冤抑，所獲揭帖，奚止千通，而未敢陳情者，酋不與馬。即此以證人民平日所受榨迫之苦痛，儘不在少，而公務人員不知自愛恣為私使者，正見其多。上有軫卹民瘼之　主席，下無深體力行之部屬，其為遺憾，自無待言。深願茲後全國上下，其矢惕厲，各自檢節。有勢位者，當以　主席愛護人民之心為心，而勿復妄用其權威；被榨迫者，應知以陳訴檢舉為原則，勿祇圖姑息而縱容。庶幾平等之旨獲符，民主之義以伸。吾人所熱烈期待者，此其三。</p>
<p>上述各端，大都老生常談，原管精義可尊。然即此而求實現，要為人民共有之斬嚮。卑之無甚高論，正以見吾人之言，式符與誦耳。謹持三祝，以期前途光輝之發惕，以佇中華民國國運之昌隆。</p>

<h3>勝利後首次元旦　滬市民熱烈慶祝　錢市長今年招待各界領袖</h3>
<p>今日爲民國三十五年元旦，同時亦爲勝利以後第一個光榮之中華民國立國紀念日，本市各機關各公團學校等均休假一天，全市並高懸國旗，以資慶祝。市府及各局各處科長以上人員，除於上午九時，在市府禮堂舉行團拜外，錢大鈞市長復將於中午十二時，在市府二樓會議室，舉行酒會，招待中外軍政黨警長官，暨社會文化等各界名流貴賓。三民主義靑年團上海支團部與市黨部，亦同時舉行聯合團拜。各警察局一律紥彩。魏德邁將軍定今日下午五時，在華懋飯店舉行鷄尾酒會，招待美軍長官，慶祝一九四六年元旦。</p>
<p>歲尾年頭　充滿和平氣象</p>
<p>八年以來，昨日上海首次歡度一九四五年之除夕，此一九四五年之最後一日，充滿和平氣象，東方大港之上海素有「不夜城」之稱，今冬因美軍近萬人在此度除夕，而更形熱鬧。上海光復後，舞塲酒吧與餐室之營業，倍形繁盛，所謂「夜間俱樂部」（舞塲與酒吧合而爲一）之設立，如雨後春筍。有爲中國人所經營者，有爲猶太人所經營者，白俄與法人所經營者亦不少。此間各戲院所上映之影片，均屬曾在內地放映者，有舊片數套，上映已近一週，賣座始終不衰。美軍鑒於各娛樂塲所索價奇昂，已由美軍自設俱樂部數處，專供美軍憇息遊樂。其中有美酒，有音樂，而享用者之所費，不及外間索價十分之一。昨晚各美軍俱樂部均有舞會，美軍紅十字會並免費招待士兵。軍委會戰地服務團，及盟軍服務委會，亦有種種節目，招待盟軍。除夕與元旦之體育節目，較平時精彩，各大公司與商店，均爭有鬥勝，以設計其大減價廣告。上海街上行人終日擁擠，除夕更見熙擾。連日天朗氣淸，除寒意日深外，未見陰霧天氣。雖除夕景况不大顯著，但上海人民數年來在日人管制下，一旦脫離縛束，均覺今年除夕，與往年有天壤之別。</p>
<p>中美將領　昨晚同樂一堂</p>
<p>本市大新公司亞洲舞廳自軍事委員會戰地服務團租借，專爲招待盟軍國軍高尚娛樂之所後，昨晚大除夕，盟軍國軍高級將領到有魏德邁二級上將，第三方面軍新聞聯絡組組長張玉麟及中外高級軍官二百餘人，中美軍人，同樂一堂，情形頗爲熱烈。充分表現中美友愛精神。</p>

<h3>殺人魔王　道斯兄弟落網</h3>
<p>自俄藉殺人魔王道斯兄弟已於日前相繼落網，在敵人佔領期內，彼倆　以曾殺若干人自豪，我愛國份子遭其兇殺者不知凡幾。此兩殺人犯，兄名沙基道斯，弟名巴立斯道斯，最初在僞滿憲兵隊任特務工作，廿八年始來滬，旋投入「七十六號」吳逆世賓部下。兄「七十六號」所執行之一切大暗殺案，皆由道斯兄弟主持。二十九年江蘇農民銀行之空前大暗殺血案，及大美晚報數度被炸死傷十餘人之大暴行案，均爲道斯弟兄之「傑作」。彼兩人身邊常常備手槍二枝，能雙手發槍，其槍法之敏捷準確，在敵僞劊子手中爲首屈一指者。勝利後，彼二人行踪極詭秘，此間美軍曾加以調查，偵捕未獲，若干日前，沙基道斯始爲我方所獲。巴立斯這斯亦於另一販賣槍械案中牽連而得綫索，於前晚爲警備總部稽查處設計捕獲，聞道斯對其在「七十六號」之暴行，均已承認。</p>

<h3>蔣慰祖　謠傳被扣眞相</h3>
<p>最近關於台灣高等法院首席檢察官蔣慰祖赴渝述職，誤傳被扣之事，各報屢有登載。日昨記者往訪滬上法界有關方面，探詢此案眞相，據謂蔣氏籍隸江蘇，大夏大學法學士，後又入法官訓練所畢業。歷任遵義·綦江·瀘縣·萬縣·等地法院院長，首席檢察官等職。秉性耿直，以淸廉苦幹著名。今春司法部創開台灣司法人員訓練班，蔣氏奉調受訓，期滿成績名列第一。勝利後，乃擢升簡派台灣高院首席檢察官之職。抵台後因辦理接收事宜，與院方作風不同，未能協調，乃奉召赴渝，報告詳情。十二月十四日，蔣氏蒙陳儀長官親署證件，搭美軍飛機來滬轉渝。外間即傳出種種離奇消息，諒係忌者故意中傷。此事除已由司法行政部在渝登報否認外，有關方面現正調查處理中。</p>

<h3>美新發明　撮「有味」電影</h3>
<p>中國業餘無綫電協會訊，美國某電影製片廠，最近製成一種影片，於放映時除與一般有聲電影能有聲有色外，幷能使在塲觀衆同時嗅到各種香味，與片中情節相配合，此種「有味」電影，誠爲電影界放一異彩，科學進步無止境，堪令人咋舌。</p>
<h3>本市軍事當局　整肅軍紀　逮捕肇事士兵九十七名</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕最近本市各電影院及戲院所發生之不幸事件，當　對　事士兵決予嚴懲，並爲防止今後不再發生同樣事件，淞滬警備總司令部已擬定辦法，俟錢總司令批准後，即可實行。大致今後士兵，每星期可得一次娛樂，時間規定爲日間，此係遵奉　蔣委員長之手令，每日下午六時後士兵無故不得外出故也。至優待戲劵由各院送至總司令部後轉發，令後各戲院開演時，並由淞滬警備總司令部派兵監護，凡遇士兵無票入塲一律禁止。</p>
<p>前晚在牛莊路中國大戲院因看白戲滋事而被捕之軍人，共有一百二十餘人，惟其中一部份約二十餘名，查係因當時强欲通過出事地點之禁戒區而被逮捕者，警備總部因彼等與看白戲滋事無關，故已於昨晨釋出，其餘尚有九十七名，現仍暫寄押於老閘分局內，將分別</p>
<p>予以嚴懲以昭儆戒，而肅風紀。按關於本市士兵軍風紀律，錢市長於二月前即已奉委座申寢電令，「自十月一日起，官兵除星期日外，不准外出，而星期日，於下午六時前亦必須一律歸隊，不得延誤，各級主管長官，尤應以身作則，嚴格遵奉，以免敗壞風紀，有礙軍譽，並免官兵體力精神之日漸墮落。」錢市長奉令後，即轉飭本市各部隊軍事機關，嚴格遵行，繼復一再嚴申前令，官兵絕對不得無票入堪觀劇，並由警備總部規定軍人看戲辦法，但仍有一部份不遵功令之　兵，强行看白戲並屢毆劇塲人員，當局對此極爲震怒，並抱迅即整肅本市軍風紀之決心，警備總部稽查處，乃於昨晚首先將在中國大戲院肇事之士兵，悉數</p>
<p>逮捕懲戒並計劃防止再有類似事件之發生，昨晨十時稽查處程處長一鳴，曾親往老閘分局向全體被捕滋事之士兵訓話，程氏詳細分晰軍人應盡之責職及應守之紀律，並告彼等此次發生之錯誤舉動，非但有失軍人信譽，且足以妨礙國家整個之聲譽，士兵聆訓後，有被感動流淚者，至十一時一刻，程氏始離老閘分局而返總部。</p>
<p>本市各電影院·平劇院及舞塲，連日發生軍人滋擾不幸事件，關係全市治安及軍風紀至深且鉅。紀者特爲此事，走訪留滬第三方面軍常局，據構：自三方面軍司令部及京滬衛戍司令部遷駐無錫後，此間僅成立上海指揮所，負責辦理遣送日僑戰俘回國及一切受降未了事宜。所有本市駐軍，不在指揮所指揮系統之內，連日軍人滋擾情事，確屬攸關治安，自應由負責當局查明嚴懲，以肅軍紀。</p>

<h3>周逆懿爲審結　辯論終結定七日宣判</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕漢奸周懿爲招工供敵一案，於昨日上午九時半，在提廠橋上海監獄高等法院審訊。先由林檢察宣讀起訴要旨，謂被告曾於前「石油聯合上海支店募集華工辦事處」担任繙繹及指導員，於民國三十三年五月間受該處委託，以鉅額</p>
<p>工資爲餌</p>
<p>在楊樹浦一帶募得工人約八十餘人，集中浦東後，用輪轉運往台灣等處，供給敵軍事方面使用。去年十月四日，始爲應募工人家屬唐欽章等，於東長治路三八五弄永昌里三十號，將被告扭交警局，轉解檢察處，事實業經被告供認不諱，且有應募工人家屬等在警局陳述，尚有二人多名至今不知下落，及證明書二紙，由是足資證明被告觸犯懲治漢奸條例第二條第三款</p>

<p>商業新聞</p>
<h3>台幣交換率公佈後　金鈔略見下挫　華洋股走勢仍俏</h3>
<p>烚赤昨因報載台幣對法幣之交換率，暫定一對三十，美金一元可兌台幣三十七元零五之訊，一部份人心竟推算美匯新率，應爲一千一百十一元半，引起賣風，晨開即自八〇萬五降至七九萬低價，後以大戶吸收美鈔不已，得以支持，此際美鈔對黃金之產額，已低至五百七十元以下，脫鈔換金者亦頗不乏人，漸漸回昇至八〇萬八，午刻則多空略有傾軋，徘徊於八〇萬大關內外，午後微升至八〇萬五左右，較上週六微挫七千，銀樓飾金八萬六，紋銀六百元，銀元四百四，暗拆初時仍爲一角弱，後因金股稍挫，去路稍呆，約八分左右。</p>
<p>美鈔因台幣對法幣美鈔之暫行交換率，已經陳長官公佈，一般人以此換率推算之下，美匯僅一千一百十元餘，（此乃台灣銀行換出台幣價，竟被一般人所忽略），陪都鈔市亦有報小，人心略受打擊，但大戶趁低仍在吸收，晨開一三八五元後逐漸拉上至一四二五元，午刻掙扎於一四二〇元左右，結果較上週六回小十元，港幣仍穩，港滬匯水有軋平之訊，對新貨頗多業外垂靑，形成求過於供，結果與上週六相較老貨平平，新貨則再好二元。</p>
<p>公債以業中人辦理結賬，昨無公開賣買，惟暗市照前日收價略有做開。</p>
<p>華股業中大戶屢施欲擒故縱策略，先放後收，是以上塲頗見疲軟，紗廠退至八百大關，美亞破六百元關，新光見四九元成交，勤興破四十元關口，不旋踵大戶出後覆進，各散戶爭先助威，業外人亦紛紛脫金購股，回騰殊速，紗廠見九百元高價，美亞七百元，新光漲至五十七元以上，景福五十三元，勤興四十八元，近午大戶二次先出後進，各股遂回寫半成以上，而收市仍被拉上，最後美亞異軍突起，走勢竟較紗廠爲堅，結果較前收計紗廠漲五十元，美亞七十五元，新光三元，景福四元半，動興五元，各大小冷門股亦頗能跟上。</p>
<p>外股亦隨華股同進退，中途極形堅俏，午收漸形穩定，結果較之上週六計怡紗漲二百三十元，怡啤二十元，紙業十五元，橡皮股依然求過於供，惟照收市價加一成漸有供源。</p>
<h3>現紗銷路大暢</h3>
<p>昨日紗市續見高翔，緣各路客銷仍極活躍，咸以現貨爲目標，汕厦等帮去化頗暢，京杭各客亦隨市吸收，均以廿支爲大宗，價約漲二萬上下，布廠襪敵對細紗及雙錢需要仍股，價又升高五六萬，廠方供售雖不見多，然業中人心想殊爲平淡。</p>
<h3>白煤漲風漸緩</h3>
<p>煤市堅穩如常，因逢年底，故交易不暢，陽泉白煤漲風漸緩，仍在高峯站穩，烟煤篩塊，用戶搜購不寂，市氣趨俏，烟煤層廠銷甚呆，潛勢頗軟，樹柴外洋到貨雖減，內河到貨則反見增加，但實銷戶採購亦衆，穩站原盤。</p>
<h3>銀錢業休假三日</h3>
<p>今日（一日）爲中華民國開國紀念日，二日三日爲銀錢業辦理全年次算，本市各行莊交易所均一律備例休假三天，惟各公司行號江海關郵政局則休假一天，在休假期內，所有票據交換，俟復業後補辦云。</p>
<h3>米市穩定　生仁芝蔴略漲</h3>
<p>米市消化仍淡，北運動而不旺，勢成擯局，惟中下南帮早薄稻微見上升百元，白陰元連日猛跌之後，昨因店方乘巧拾收，疲而復振，回漲三五百元，麵粉胃呆，續小一二百元，中次雜牌供多於求，苦無受主，價小二三百元，油市續小數百元，平價油各油店均在出貨之中，大約於新年開關出售，已先派一部份，後途尚有續派，豆餅汕頭厦門仍然續辦，形勢牢立，黃豆高定次削，生仁異常俏利，再加千元，芝蔴價升千餘元，去化尚活，棉菜餅以燃料上升，隨之堅挺，麩皮穩站，酒市看漲，自明日起，</p>
<h3>商情撮要</h3>
<p>染料掀起激烈漲風，江北漢口靑島溫州等帮大量吸收，因之硫化元黑靛粉雙鵝元快靛等染料無不較上週末昇二三成。</p>
<p>胡桃以到船報關手續未及辦妥，提貨須俠至新年休假滿期後，因之行家已有現貨者廢不扳持，討價彌俏。</p>
<p>十二磅細布白坯根子依然緊俏，染織廠因急於染色，願出較高代價收購。</p>
<h3>一年來金融與商業</h3>
<p>— 重伯</p>
<p>三十四年度爲滬市全社會最痛苦最黑暗期，雖德日兩國先後於五月八月降服，勝利已屬我國，但物價之狂潮，奔騰澎湃，僞幣折合率之低落，駭目驚心，洵上海商業史上可紀念之一頁，追憶往事，分述於左。</p>
<p>金融　年頭銀根緩和，千元日拆僅掛三角，一月下旬改掛六角五分後，直至八月下旬世界大戰告終，物價開始大跌，銀行錢莊大批停業淸理，乃冉冉下降，由三角至二角，九月下旬且小至五分，十月以後偽幣對法幣二百作一兌換比價確定，投機市塲及囤戶用銀增加，再由一角回升至三角，迄歲暮不變，暗息當以八月上旬俄對日宣戰時之大五角利爲最高，惟僅證券市塲三五日間事。烚赤一月上旬在八十萬關口盤旋，十七日低峯且見七十六萬元，下旬突破一百萬大關，自此扶搖直上，二月下句，陰歷年頭紅盤交易，忽傳日商與登部隊搜購，衝破三百萬元，三月上旬聞重慶金價廉，及僞方金證劵上市，價稍疲，其後德國局勢不佳，投機買氣步緊，四月中旬突達一千二百萬元，五月間德已屈服，偽金證劵濫售微平，六七月間日在太平洋戰事節節潰敗，金價飛騰，七月下句原子炸彈爆擊廣島時，十兩金價昂至一萬三千萬元，八月十日日皇裕仁宣佈無條件全面投降，頂峯竟見僞幣二萬萬元，斯時全世界戰事告終，我軍陸續空運來滬，囤戶爭先售出，僅九日間猛降至二千三百萬元，惟當時偽幣比價，尚祇六七十對一，爾後僞幣黑市愈跌，金價愈漲，重見一萬零六百萬元。直至九月二十八日明定二百對一，全滬物價一律以法幣買賣，金價站三十八萬四千元，十月下旬華北及東九省接收頓挫，國共談判未次，引起擁資者與投機家再度買金，三十一日重見高峯一百十萬元，比八月十一日僞幣頂峯二萬萬元更高二千萬元，十一月份在八九十萬元徘徊，旋因海運恢復，對外貿易開始，十二月十一日美鈔跌進一千元，金價由於六十美元對一兩之見解，連帶跌爲五十八萬三千元，然財政當局頗主提高美鈔兌換價，減少大量進口貨，以保護本國幼稚工業，故年底復回高至八十一萬三千元收盤，此三十三年底之偽幣七十八萬元，表面上漲法幣三萬三千元，實際暴漲偽幣一萬六千一百八十二萬元之鉅。紋銀與去年底同價，惟比僞幣暗漲亦鉅。美鈔年頭售一千二百元，九月下句我軍勢力開抵上海後，美鈔狂漲至偽幣十七萬元，十月初改以法幣呌價後，低峯六百七十五元，旋以外滙不定，進出口商以美鈔爲貨物結價標準，三十一日高峯見一千七百八十元，十二月十日美英銀行復業時，疑美滙將掛牌，美鈔步降至九百三十元，卒以我國法令不許外商重營外滙，當局並有提高美鈔傾向，復後　回漲，年底以法幣一千四百三十元收盤，較三·三年底僞幣一千元，表面漲法幣四百三十元，實際漲僞幣十八萬五千元。</p>
<p>證券　公債交易以統一丙種最活潑，一月初站三百六十元，旋因法幣滙價提高，及國際時局利於我國，市價步漲，八月中旬日軍降服，竟暴漲至十七萬元，九月下旬改用法幣叫價後，因額面償還關係，十月下旬一度小至二百十元，卒以傳有孫票還本，及勝利津貼金消息，同時實貨籌碼枯竭，引起軋空暴舉，十二月十九日高峯見八百五十元，與八月間偽幣頂峯十七萬元相並，年底以七百七十元收盤，比三十三年底，高三百九十元。華股外股買氣甚緊，年底均以新高價收盤，領袖華股永安紗廠年底價八百二十元，較三十三年底漲三百九十五元。</p>
<p>貨物　商品中紗花布明跌而暗漲，生絲以出口關係，明暗俱大漲，英美煙因外商及美煙葉，漲風亦萬，白煤因存貨不敷，明暗皆漲，其餘各物表面雖跌，就僞幣折合率推算，咸比三十三年爲高，茲將主要商品市價，列表比較於後。（單位元）</p>

<h3>新年獻詞</h3>
<p>— 張一渠</p>
<p>「敎育抬頭！」在這新年，在這勝利後第一個新年，我們應該這樣的虔誠祝禱。</p>
<p>從多方面的事實觀察一下，今後的敎育或許有「抬頭」的可能。浙江省府黃主席提議，民國三十五年定爲「敎育年」，這便是「敎育抬頭」的一個信號。敎育部規定民國三十五年爲實施電化敎育五年計劃的第一年，這便是「敎育抬頭」的一部分的設計。全國內遷各大學，定民國三十五年全部復校；識字敎育普及計劃，定民國三十五年全面展開，澈底實施；還有，敎育部與各省市敎育歷局通力合作，在民國三十五年度將有次舉行勝利後的各種留學生考試；並分別推進全國敎育復員後的各項新設施，如科學實騐所，勞作中心站，職業訓練班，以及輕重工業接收硏究……等等，一切一切都在顯示着「敎育抬頭」的新希望。</p>
<p>實在的，我們要把國家民族抬頭，不得不先把敎育抬起頭來！因此，我們應該檢討，應該時刻檢討：「敎育眞的抬頭沒有？」從這勝利後的第一個新年起。</p>
<h3>今年定為　敎育年</h3>

<p>小談</p>
<h3>元旦發筆</h3>
<p>— 今純</p>
<p>『元旦發筆，萬事大吉。』</p>
<p>『元旦書紅，萬事亨通。』</p>
<p>記得從小時候起，每到新年，早起第一件事，就是隨着大人，把裁成一條條約紅紙，恭恭敬敬的寫着發筆的瑞語。寫完貼在書桌邊牆上，還時時的去看。當時也不大明白這些句子的用意，但寫時總是那般興奮。</p>
<p>年年壁上發筆的吉語，元旦貼新了，又隨着歲月黯淡下去。我漸漸對寫發筆的吉語生了一種依戀，更起了無限的悵惘。</p>
<p>本來，靠筆桿爲生的文人，自然很珍惜他的筆桿。筆桿使他得到滿足，但更會使他遭到失望；筆桿使他得到快慰，但更會使他感到悲哀；筆桿使他被到光榮，但更會使他蒙到恥辱和不幸。他渴望能利用他的一枝筆，完成他偉大的任務，不願去寫那些瑣屑無調的作品；他渴望用他的一枝筆描寫人類快樂的事，不忍去記述那些悲慘不幸的事件；他渴望用他的一枝筆去自由表達自己的思想，傳達社會的公論，不想再因為文字得到意外的糾紛。以往這種願望大概是不易達到的，但至少是他一直渴想的。於是每逢元旦，我們很容易想象出：他帶着那種虔誠的心情，在紅紙上寫着；『萬事大吉，』『萬事亨通。』我再看不出那是一種節令的點綴，再不覺得那含有些微迷信或俗套的成份，我看到那紅紙條一年年的黯淡，又一年年貼新的，我就同情文人的悲哀，更欽佩文人的偉大。</p>
<p>八年來，我已將元旦發筆的事忽略，貼在壁上多年前的紅紙條，也黯淡得發了迷糊。</p>
<p>今天是勝利後第一個元旦，我一早起來，懷着一種特別的興奮情緒，感到更誠切，更自信，在紅紙上寫着：</p>
<p>『元旦發筆，萬事大吉。』</p>
<p>『元旦書紅，萬事亨通。』</p>
<p>我拿這兩句吉語來　勵自己，我謹用這兩句吉語，向讀者道賀。</p>
<p>風俗</p>
<h3>新年的掌故</h3>
<p>— 冬心</p>
<p>除夕守夜</p>
<p>風土記：『蜀之風俗，至除夕達旦不眠，謂之守歲。』東波守歲詩：『欲知垂盡歲，有如赴　蛇。』歐美人仕也有守歲的風俗，除夕坐守着不睡，靜聽敎堂中送舊迎新的鐘聲。據說除夕鳴這種鐘，起源於古代的英國人。英國人習俗，在除夕十二點鐘前，用布蒙住鐘，聽到的是低沉的聲音，一到十二點鐘，立刻除去蒙的布，鐘登時發出淸脆響亮的聲音，一個是代表衰殘的舊歲，一個是象徵嶄新的新年。文人們也多愛聽道鐘聲，鄧利生有除夕聞鐘的詩，蘭白也說，『鐘聲中最莊嚴動人的，是除夕的鐘聲。』</p>
<p>饋送年禮</p>
<p>我國新年饋送禮物，已是很古的習慣。西方人送年禮，起源於古代羅馬人。原來羅馬人照例要在元旦送元老院議員禮物，是要議員在這一年中保護他們。羅馬皇帝克老弟竟定下一條律法，規定議員平時不得需索禮品，但在元旦一天，儘可公開的需索。關於這類風俗，歷史家蘇東尼斯同達西大斯都有詳盡的記載。當時送的禮品不過是些小玩藝，送年禮的風俗後來流傳給英國人，漸漸遍及全歐洲，英國在伊利莎白女王時代，送年禮之風最盛，送的禮物也爭奇逐異，漸效奢華。據說伊利莎白女王的第一雙黑絲襪就是寵臣送的年禮，那是女太太穿絲襪的濫觴，因爲以前伊利莎白女王還一直是着的布襪子</p>
<p>講到送年禮，現在西方各國中，大概以法國同西班牙最道地。有一時，年禮最普通的是手套，後來大家都習用糖果，月份牌日歷因爲很合時令，也很風行，近來有好多人都喜歡買書，當年禮饋送。</p>
<p>拜年賀喜</p>
<p>新年團拜，我們至今仍沿襲着。有些老年人同婦女，整年不出門的，到了新年，也要振起精神來，套上新衣服，出去大拜其年。有一本書講英國人拜年很有趣，英國拜年的習慣也是從羅馬人處學來的。有一個時期，大家把這禮節看得很重，一到元旦，闔家都出去拜年，結果大家誰也碰不到誰，大家都不在家。其實我們拜年的情形也是這樣。</p>
<p>美國人拜年的習慣，又是由荷蘭人傳去的，因荷蘭人最多禮，又是好客。但現代因爲人事冗忙，這種古老的風俗，在歐美各國，已漸不被人所重視了。</p>
<p>慶祝新年</p>
<p>各國慶祝年年雖一樣的熱烈，但方式多少總有些不同。歐美各國，普通是耶誕比新年熟鬧，但其中法國人比較更重視新年。新年似乎是一個社交的節令。</p>
<p>蘇格關人有一種迷信，就是去人家拜年，若是第一個進去，一年中一定大交好運。你也早，我也早，後來是除夕十二點鐘一敲，拜年的已走了進來，於是大家整夜狂歡慶祝。</p>
<p>帝俄時代，慶祝新年是鳴炮，現在挪威，瑞典諸國，慶祝新年時，仍歡喜放槍，弄得新年時祇聽到槍炮聲音。</p>
<p>日本人新年，門上要縣掛松竹同蝦，據說松代表長壽，竹代表靑春，蝦代表快樂。</p>
<p>慶祝新年最普通的方式就是大吃上一頓，不過吃的方式種類也隨着各地不同。野蠻人吃東西，預祝身體强壯，文明人吃東西又參着得好運道的迷信。相傳波斯人過年時，要吃鷄蛋，據說蛋是象徵新生的意思，所以西方人復活節也饋贈蛋，我國過年時也吃茶葉蛋，但那是代表元實。</p>
<p>修養</p>
<h3>過新年，做新人</h3>
<p>— 劍如</p>
<p>一刹眼，三十四年又在不知不覺中溜過，繼着來的，便是値得抓住的三十五年的新年—抗戰勝利後第一個新年。我這樣打量着：過新年，做新人。</p>
<p>其實，我說錯了，新年是什麽？怎樣是新人？原來新年就是未來的一刹那，新人就是在那一刹兒中生了新的力，從事於新的發展，勞力於重新做人。不可捉摸的一刹那，便是新年了，我們要抓住一刹那，重做我們的人生</p>
<p>世界上有多少殘缺的生命，打破他們命運的遭遇。拜倫的脚是跛的，貝多芬的耳是聾的，塌鼻的米啓郞琪，瞎眼的米爾頓，他們是多少的不幸，生命上受到了殘缺；但是，他們却不斷的努力反抗，不斷的要求過新年，總於表現了天才，成就了偉大的事業，做了新人。</p>
<p>新年，什麽是新年？天天都是新年，祗要我們天天的奮鬥。前面有一盞光明的燈燃着，只要我們具了拜倫，貝多芬，密爾頓的努力，不斷地前進，光明的燈會落在我們手裏，我們運是新人了。</p>
<p>隨筆</p>
<h3>忘八旦與橫八旦</h3>
<p>— 渡雲</p>
<p>據傳古有一聯云「一二三四五六七，孝弟忠信禮義廉。」前隱忘八，後隱無恥。爲此打官話罵人，有忘八蛋一語。今日欣逢吾大中華民國三十五年元旦，怎可駡人，且把兩句話來解釋一下。</p>
<p>忘八旦者，呌我們可忘掉過去八年的元且，這個日子是艱苦的，環境是憂鬱的；現在是勝利了，過此第九個元旦，天日重光，世界和平。祝今年國事底定。一切都上軌道；物價下跌，民生問題解決；建國成功，保持着大國的光榮，比如「婦人生產時就憂愁，因爲他的時候到了。旣生了孩子，就不再紀念，那苦楚，因爲歡喜世上生一個人」在受了過去的艱辛，這所謂「抗戰是過程！」產生了一個活潑有生氣的直正自由國家，而完成革命的眞諦，這所謂「建國是目的」，目的達到，怎不呌我們歡樂！</p>
<p>還有從前敵　尋事侵略，老歡喜製造一個有八字的日子，什麽九一八，一二八，八一三，一二八。此番敵寇屈服後，後一個元旦來臨，呌我們不再紀念這不祥的八字，這也是呌「忘八旦」</p>
<p>至於過去我們在淪陷區的人民財產，遭了敵寇八年槓行，過了八個元旦，是謂「橫八旦。」到了第九個元旦。那擾亂世界和平，存野心好侵略的國家，已被打倒，就不能再事橫行了。</p>
<p>社會</p>
<h3>巧合的民間讖語</h3>
<p>— 徐縉卿</p>
<p>古時童謠往往含議玄奧，當時令人莫名其妙。但有時事實表現，竟也有「未卜先知」之妙。</p>
<p>本年夏季，寗波社會，不知由何人創始，說是敵寇將於秋季滾蛋。詢以何以知之？則謂「頂遠」（謂極遲）在「新稻擄落」之時。其理由是寗波倫陷後，第一任「專員」是「沈」　逆爾喬，次爲「陶」逆孝潔，又次爲「羅」逆夢薌，末後爲「陸」逆懋儀·「新」（沈）「稻」（陶）「據」（羅）「落」（陸）四逆以後，決無繼任之人。由此斷定「新稻擄落」爲日寇滾蛋「頂遠」之時。因爲當時浙江僞省主席是「丁」逆默村，鄞縣僞縣長是「袁」逆端甫，「丁袁」正好與「頂遠」諧音。</p>
<p>不料八月初蘇聯對日宣戰，美國使用原子彈，雙管齊下，寇軍不堪壓迫，無條件投降。當敵寇退出甬城時，正是新稻收穫之日，實在是一件有趣巧合的事。</p>
<p>社會服務</p>
<h3>賀勝利後的快樂新年　願讀者努力為「社會服務」</h3>
<p>今天欣逢勝利後第一個元旦，大家在艱苦的八年抗戰後，過着快樂新年，心坎裘自有說不盡的歡喜！追溯既往，全國人民，地無論南北，人無論老幼，誰不渴望早日勝利，重見光明！果然最後勝利來臨，又欣逢快樂的新年，不禁喜極而涕零。全國同胞，得有今天的光榮快樂，開宗明義，第一當感謝最高領袖　蔣主席偉大的勳業！</p>
<p>新年到了，我們對於自己的責任，應得檢討一下，爲社會，國家，爲勝利後的復興建設，任何方面，各人都不能輕易放棄責任。從今後，我們先得問自己，將做那一等人？還能因循偸安，意志頽唐，思想陳腐，行爲放蕩，投機取巧，損人利己麼？不！決不可再存劣等民族的氣息。大家要做自强不息，朝氣蓬勃，勤愼忠勇的第一等大國民；必人人爲國家以務，事事爲社會效勞；然後我們這國家，纔可以復興，纔可以富强！蔣主席所著「中國之命運」，不是說得很透澈麼？人生以「服務」爲目的，願全國同胞，盡其最大的努力！</p>
<h3>確保航行安全　請航政當局注意</h3>
<p>我國沿海，前經敵軍佔領以後，即埋置水雷等爆炸物，淪陷期中，不知已有幾許船隻觸雷沉失。本年五月間滬甬問之華泰輪在吳淞口外銅沙洋面觸雷沉沒，生命損失數以千計。自勝利光臨後，有關當局即行着手掃雷工作，但工作効能，普通市民當不能知悉，今番華陞輪自閩來滬，又在上述地點觸雷失事，生命財產損失不貲，誰負其過？昨報又載某英輪在佘山洋面遇險，據悉尙有其他船隻遭遇同一命運。是故敬請航政當局及有關機關協同商議，短期內舉行大規模掃雷工作，務希澈底消除水雷，俾可確保航行安全。</p>

<h3>文化運動的前瞻</h3>
<p>— 張道藩</p>
<p>為民國三十五年元旦而作</p>
<p>文化的本質，是向上與自由，亦即黑格爾所說的「求一種較高的解放」。這解放包含個人心靈求向上，與民族精神求自由。他的過程，就是一種運動。我國自清末變法以來，文化運動的路綫很多，步　亦亂。當時對外來的文化，旣未能善為選擇與吸收，而國際的政治侵略，又動搖了我固有的優良民族德性。晚清百年間，「國家民族在政治，經濟，社會，倫理與心理各方面，無不頹風外暴，危機內伏，幾至毀滅我再生的基礎，杜絕我復興的根源。」（引　蔣主席語）如果沒有國父一面適應世界的潮流，一面繼承歷史的傳統，三民主義的文化運動，今天中國文化不會重新得到向上的途徑。</p>
<p>文化運動的過程，應該包含兩個階段；一是文化鬥爭，一是文化建設，三民主義的文化運動，在國民革命過程中，業已完成其鬥爭的使命。今後的任務，應該是向積極的建設途上前進，以完成心理，倫理，社會，政治，經濟等五大建設為最終目的。</p>
<p>三十二年冬中央所頒佈的文化運動綱領，曾扼要的提出五大建設的原則。心理建設方面要「建立革命的人生觀，以改革國人茍且偷生，冷　自私的悲　，而能提起積極精神，確立自信，力行革命。」倫理建設方面，要「改進人民的行為，恢復民族固有的道德，從而發揚光大，養成國民高尚健全的人格，使我們四萬萬五千萬同胞，人人能夠犧牲小我，捨己利　，盡忠國家，盡孝民族，崇信重義，仁民愛物，和平互助。」社會建設方面，要「使社會上一切分子的生活行動，都能遵循一定的規律，使社會一切有關人民福利的基本事業，都有程序的興建起來。」政治建設方面，要「以響發國民自主自動的精神為基礎，加強行使四權的能力，促使全民政治的實現。」經濟建設方面，要「本人盡其才，地盡其利，物盡其用，貨暢其流之　教，以充實國防，裕厚民生。」</p>
<p>此五大建設，實際也就是建國的根本，在這　短文裏，　我們不能作詳盡的　發，今天我們所要說的是今後文化運動的方針，應如何配合此五大建設的原則，關於　一說，蔣主席在三十四年國慶日的勝利廣播中，曾給我們明確的指示。他說戰後文化建設的方針，在獎進科學研究，保障學術自由，並轉移社會風氣，請印論之。</p>
<p>建國工作，無事不需要人才，無事不需要技術，我們中國百事落後，而科學尤甚，目前的世界已進入原子能時代，而我們的工業發展尚未能步入機械時代，實是憆乎其後，今後我們一面要迎頭趕上，一面更要糾正近年來中國科學發展的偏廢趨向；那就是偏重應用科學，忽視純粹科學。就學術本身言，這是舍本逐末，就實用技術言，也是輕重倒置。因為實用的科學，有賴於高深的學理做基礎，今我國以一個科學落後的國家，而再有這種不健康的趨向，是應該特別有所警惕的。蔣主席在指示我們戰後文化建設的方針中，就已經特別闡明，對於純粹科學，當與運用科學同樣注重。</p>
<p>不過高深學術的研究，有賴於國家的教育政策和政治制度能尊重人民個性的發展，更有賴於學術研究的自由獲得合法的保障，然後學術研究，方能自由生長而發揚光大。</p>
<p>建國大業，經緯萬端，但有一個根本就是要踐履寫實的人才。近幾年我們的社會風氣太壞了。為國家民族盡忠的人固然不少，然而一般社會習尚是冷酷自私，　奪紛爭，我們今後文化建設努力的方向，應該要改造社會的風氣，中國有幾句老話「君子之德風，小人之德草，草上之風必偃」這裏所謂風就是一種風氣。我們的社會風氣若能轉移到精勤篤實，奉公守法，則過去那種因循怠惰，虛偽浮靡的病症，自可根絕，這是一種極艱巨的工作，但也是最基本的工作，我們常聽到對於某件事的失敗，社會的評論是人謀不滅，我們若作更深一層的觀察，就會發現這人的後面潛伏着一種惡劣的社會風氣，今當建國開始，我們首先要改造社會風氣。</p>
<p>語云「行百里者半九十」，我們八年的艱苦抗戰，雖已勝利結束，而建國前途，坎坷猶多，文化運動的鬥爭使命雖已完成，而文化建設工作，更繁且重，當茲歲始，謹略抒所見願與吾國文化界人士共勉之。</p>
<h3>基督教與中國文化的新生</h3>
<p>— 葉秋原</p>
<p>中華民國三十五年的元旦是抗戰勝利後第一個愉快的新年。這是積極建國開始的一年。在建國的工作上，其所包括的部門原是根廣；但是最重要而基本的實莫若文化建設或精神建設。在物質建設方面，我們今後雖可能興築一四，〇〇〇公里的鐵道和一，五〇〇，〇〇〇公里的公路，可以有一四，四一七，四〇〇　的商船，和一〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇的紗埞；但這些物質建設，若不伴隨以文化建設或精神建設。可能引起惡劣的後果。故　總　於「中國之命運」，論到建國工作的重點，　首先論到心理建設，倫理建設；　些原都是文化建設，或精神建設的一部。從　　建國的史實，我們看到兩個例子，可以作為我們建國的　　。第一是日本，第二是蘇聯。日本在維新以後，積極建國，將西方的物質文明，幾乎全部移殖了過去；用能日　富強。但在它建國的過程內，忽略了文化或精神建設，不能將西方精神文明的核心也同時加以接　，　至六十年來的艱巨建國工作毀於一旦。至於蘇聯，它以社會主義　建國的最高　　，故於連　　　五年計劃從事物實建國之際，　致力於社會主義文化建設的工作，它的後果如何，自有待於將來的　展；但無論如何，它之能同時注意到物質與文化建設，實足為我們借　。中國以三民主義為建國最高願望，物質精神，　方並　；此在我　　　及　總裁，固已迭有昭　，自富奉為　　。茲値積極建國開始之年，願就我國文化的新生，做一展望。</p>
<p>講到我國的文化，包括我們的思想行為生活習慣，以及起居衣食等等，這裏面原包有極多的外來成分，非我國自己的東西。我們居洋房坐汽車固不必說，即在一般事物中，我們接受了外國的東西，亦復所在皆有。我們的「國樂」，若琵琶胡琴，原本來是西域，不是我們道地的「國　」。我們的「國　」，掛首「華陀再生」的功德　，而這華陀是否為道地的中國人也是問題。我們鄉下的老太太，看了悲慘的事，洫然喊出一聲「阿彌陀佛」；這「阿彌陀佛」也不是我們原有的東西，孔子時代的人就不會這樣叫出來。就是我們藍禮袍黑掛的「國服」，也不是我們自己的服飾而是滿洲胡人的服裝。諸如此類，可見我國文化內所含的外國成分實在很多。這也許不是過分的話，就是當我國與外國接角頻繁與外國文化接觸特多的時候，也就是我國文化史上最燦爛的時期，若唐，若宋，若明末清初都是如此。如果中國文化有特點，這個特點，就在它的能吸收外國文化。</p>
<p>我國與西方的接觸，最初的引導是宗教，唐代的景教—基督教的一派—雖不來自西歐，但已來自海中海濱的羅馬世界，其所用的文字，還以敘利來文為主。元代時，羅馬教宗會派遣方濟各會會士來來華傳教，是為我國與西歐最初往來的紀錄，其後自明清以迄近世，中國與西歐的接觸愈益頻繁，留學生的大批前往歐美，以及歐美工商界人士的接踵來華，使中國的都市，中國人民的生活習慣上都起了變動。「工業化」「科學化」的呼號，使中國傳統的生活及文化，帶上了西方近代物質文明的外裝。但對於西洋精神生活，即西歐的宗教生活卻忽略了。我們看到西方的物質文明，往往對於西方的精神文明未加注意，一部分的人，甚至以為我們自己有高度的精神文明，對本文的精神文明不屑注意。這結果是造成出洋留學，住洋房，坐汽車，娶姨太太，以至營私舞弊，旣不講我國固有的禮義廉恥，亦不懂西方的精神價値，坐紀綱失墜；所以在建國工作上，實以倫理　設為最基本。</p>
<p>基督教為西歐精神生活之所寄。西歐人士如果有些美德，這些美德的源泉不是在他們政治的修明，而是在他們的生活為基督教所默化。政治的修明，衹是他們生活基督教化的結果。在非常的時候，我們常看見到英美的領袖帶着宗教的口吻呼　上蒼。他們的生活行為受宗教與道德的雙重制裁，用能井然有序，這些都是為我們取法的地方。西方物質文明的長處，我們固然應該吸收，就是西方精神文明的長處，我們也應採納，在採納西方精神文明上，我們就應該採納基督教。伴隨着「工業化」的建國，必須有「基督教化」的建國，必須有「基督教化」的建國。中國文化的新生是在如何吸收基督教和精華，便與我國傳統文化相調的，因而推進一種新的文化運動。在我國傳統的文化裏，一定要加上一些新的血，這新血就是基督教。我國固有的道德，都是基督教的道德，這些道德理想，經過近年來的廢馳，須用基督教的新血來培養始能滋長。</p>
<p>基督教在我國文化上　像是一宗未曾消化的東西。明代的徐光啟，李之藻及楊廷筠等人，雖曾通譯過一些有關基督教養的書籍，但這種工作後來因清廷的管教而遭到了停頓。近一百年來，天主教以深入民間為主，以致對於文化方面的活動未曾十分致力；其在所謂當反教方面，　　　設大學，也忽略了中國文化的研究，故其對於中國文化還不發生深刻的影響。現在不平，　　已經取消，基督教在中國的傳布等將益見興盛。基督教要在中國文化方面起作用，必先使之為中國人所接受；而欲使中國人接受，必先建立基督教文　。佛教到是國來，在中國文化上起作用，　在於致力佛教文獻的建立。基督教的典籍何可數計，這些還少被翻譯到中國文；因此，基督教還沒有在中國文學裏起影響，乃不為士大夫所重。今後基督教必先將基督教文學建立起來，然後基督教在中國的流傳，始能及於一般知識階段。我們　明的　蔣主席，於日理萬幾之中，還致力於聖經漢譯的修訂，即欲為中國建立基督教文獻，此其用意深長，何待　言。</p>
<p>就基督教的立場來說，基督教有吸收各文化傳統之使命，其本身却居各民族文化之上。故基督教在法國為法國文化，在美為美國文化，在西班牙為西班牙文化。但基督教本身却包有各民族文化傳統之長。基督教　　於布伯萊民族，其間自包有希伯來的傳統，及其流傳於希臘軍馬的　界裏又吸收了希臘軍馬的傳統。調和希臘傳統與基督教的這一　歷史使命一直到十六世紀才由　多瑪斯完成。他將亞裡斯多　的傳統基督教化了。這是　重要的綜合，基督教到中國來必須與中國傳統相調和，而中國的傳統實以儒家思想為骨幹，基督教之為世界宗教就在它的吸收調和能力，故它必須吸收中國儒家的傳統而加以調和；因這吸收調和，可為基督教進入一新階段，同時，又可為中國的儒家運動給以一種新的力量。這一調和，無疑地，將為中國文化史上燦爛的一頁。中國文化的新生，就在乎此。</p>
<p>嘆觀今世，文化的分野，　然呈現三種　　的趨勢。在一面，我們看見有蘇聯的積極在企圖建設它的社會主義文化，在另一面，在西歐，在美洲，澳洲乃至世界的一大部分都是基督教的世界。此外，就是文化落後的民族了。我們要自拔文化落後，若不走向社會主義的路，便得走向基督教文明的路，而且只有這一條才是我們的路。蔣論主席在到心理建設倫理建設的時候，一再地叮囑我們要恢復固有的道德，我國因有道德的恢復及新生，尤賴乎基督教在中國之推行，將我國舊有的倫理觀念基督教化，才能產生一種新力量，一種新風起。我們希望國人對基督教多多注意研究，基督教本身也能對中國文化多多注意研究，中國文化將因吸收了基督教而益活潑燦爛，基督教因吸收並調和了中國傳統而益加充實。文化建設，精神建設，其在乎斯。</p>
<h3>民主與法治</h3>
<p>— 楊幼炯</p>
<p>當前世界政治思潮之動向，莫不以民主政治為躇趨；惟民主政治必須以法治為基礎。今日國人所羨稱的英美民主政治，因有百年以上的法治習慣與傳統，遂能推行於長久的歲月中。英國　政習慣是國會對內閣表示不信任時，內閣便須辭職或解散國會，徵求民意以決定去留；美國黨法規定每四年舉行一次總統選舉。這是英美的民主政治所遵循的法治常賴。假使英國內閣在國會不信任時不首辭職，或　國總統到了四年任滿不肯下野競選，試問英美的民主政治能夠風平浪靜的延續至於今日麼？所以我們以為談民主必不可撇開法治。老實說，沒有維持法紀奉行法治的　意，決不可侈言民主。此理甚明，無待詳論。</p>
<p>政實施，為期不遠，但我們國人的法治觀念，培養未深，法紀更未能堅強的樹立起來。是非順逆旣未明　，如何能使人民對民主政治有深切的認識。法治的基本精神在使政治生活為理智所支配，理智是與武力相對立的，所以在國內一切足以引起政治糾紛的問題，都不能以武力　　求解決的途徑。我們當前需要建立一種法紀，使政府與人民有一種共同遵循的常軌。建國大綱所規定的建國程序，已為全國上下公認為民主黨政所依據的政治常軌，我們不應於此政治常軌之外，別尋其他政治解決的途徑。因此我們正視此時此際的政治局勢之演變。我們願望政府與各方不得撇開法紀，不可因政治之一時紛擾而不遵循民主專政的正常途徑，否則必有治絲愈紊之慮。</p>
<p>召開國民大會本為解決時局之唯一途徑，而政府以前一再延期，不能示國人以國民大會為建樹　政常軌之決心；一部分人士甚且有認召開國民大會將為引起時局糾紛之主因者。如果真想撇開國民大會，擱置不開，試問彼動亂以結束訓政實施　政為藉口之政論家，又將以　道而實現真正的民主？我們以為民主政治的精神，在理智，在真誠，但決不是一種政爭的工具。民主政治如果不能建立在法治的基礎之上，則政局徒增紛擾，政爭將無有已時。我們於此不得不提醒國人應認識民主與法治是惠政實施的兩大條件。</p>
<p>我們當然不能說有　法，就是民主政治，但在今日的中國，確需要一部為人民所擁護的　法。民國肇造已三十多年，而我們遠沒有一部根本大法。根本大法未立，如何如使　政常軌臻於承固？我們因此主張應儘早召開國民大會，完成制　工作，以奠立法治基礎。國人的法治習染不深，非積極造成　政常軌，不足以綱維社會秩序，即使所謂各黨各派人士，也應在　政上鬥智爭　，不必老是釘眼在現實政權的爭奪上。對於行將召開的政治協商會亟，我們衹希望做到「協商」的地步，萬不能聽其由黨派的協商而變更　政的程序。甚　國人對此加以密切的注視！</p>
<p>民國成立以來，每次變亂的發生，大半由於不依法定的程序，作不擇手段的政爭。政爭在民主國家，本非不祥名辭。政爭必須在法紀範圍之內，否則大家雖昌言民主，而實際仍無補於民主政治之實施。今日政論龐雜，似乎頭緒紛繁，其實談理論，我們衹聽到簡單的民主口號。民主政治一辭，包括一部廣泛的歷史，其內容往往因時因地而有相當的差別，但在歷史發展上，或從制度的趨勢來看，民主政治有一顯著的物質，就是各政黨以其主張，求得人民的擁護，以為取得政權的前提。我們希望今日所謂各黨各派的人士，各提出其顯明的政綱，徵求全國民眾的公意，在國家的法治常軌上爭取民眾的擁護，衹有大公無私的適合時代需要的政治主張，才能為民眾所信仰。民主政治決不是靠了政治談到所能實現，也斷非跳舞茶會拉攏交情所能建立，這些都是敷衍，都是　就，何嘗真為國家百年大計打算？真正民主政治的基礎，是要建立在為全民所擁護的政策之上的。我們主張各黨各派人士此時應該公開提出政治主張，展開關於政策之論辯，反對任何曖昧的政治勾當，任何秘密的政治談判。惟有大家在政策上的論辯，才能發現民主政治的真理，也衹有以政策爭取民眾的信仰，才能有取得政權或繼續政權的希望。否則便不是民主政治家的風度。我們站在純正的客觀立場，認定衹有遵循國家已定的建國程序，實施　政，經過八年來痛苦的人民，始得有和平康樂之日。</p>
<h3>設立工程專管機構議</h3>
<p>— 陳茹玄</p>
<p>抗戰勝利，建國益亟，中央近　擬訂一年建設計劃，依照國父手訂之實業計劃，與　總裁昭示之工業建設，今後建國工作之重心，固已準循有自，綜其大要，如鐵路公路之修建，沿海及內河港埠之建築，河道之疏溶，晨田水利之改良，動力之開發，電訊之敷設，公共住宅工鑛廠房之建造，都市自來水與下水道等等之設施，以及國防要塞與飛機場之修筑，實多屬於公共工程之範圍。</p>
<p>公共工程於經濟建設，具有導引動力之作用，先進各國當物質建設之初，幾無不藉之以立工業建設之始基，在經濟恐慌時期，尤　以舉辦公共工程為解決失業問題之要策，良以公共工程在運行之時，可以安插大量員工，而解決其生活；可以增加工具及原料之需要，而刺激其生產，一九三三年美總統羅斯福當經濟恐慌潮澎湃之時，施行新政」（New　Deal），舉辦防洪　殖市政電化諸端，即以公共工程為主幹，卒以安渡難關，充實國力，成效昭著，可為明證，至公共工程完成以後，則開發資源，促進生產，便利貨物之運銷，金融之流通，使大眾生活改善，社會繁榮，其功垂久遠，澤被民生，更無待　。</p>
<p>我國目前社會經濟正在動盪之秋，對日戰事結束未久，而後方工業以產品滯銷，銀根奇緊，已感不能支持，有岌岌不可終日之勢，停工解雇，時起風潮，呼　救濟之聲，遍於各埠，政府不得已廣發工貸，施行貼補，勉救一時之急，要非根本之間，同時軍事結果，戰士復員，實施編遣以後，將有大批編餘官兵，亟須妥為安插，又原辦軍事工程停止，多數技術員工，勢須改　，亦未便任其閒置，原有組織及工具物資，尤應設法利用，凡此情況，昭昭在目，語云「他山之石，可以攻玉」，盟邦前例，足資借鑑，則按照計劃，從速舉　各項公共工程，藉以安插人員，刺激生產，解決目前急迫之社會經濟問題，當無疑義。</p>
<p>按此範圍，是項工程專管機構，旣不致與原有行政機構發生職種劃分不清之問題，且可加速其業務之進展，對於建設計劃，乃得推行盡利，建國前途，其庶有豸，</p>
<p>公共工程為建國之基本工作，尤為目前當務之急，旣如上述，而主持此項工程之機構，對於施行之實效，關係綦大，殊有檢討之必要，茲根據過去經騐，旺　中外成制，一申論之。</p>
<p>公共工程之進行必求迅速經濟，必注意於人力物力之調配適當，當工程進行之時，需要大批人力物力，積極追趕，而在工程完成以後，則此項人力物力毋須繼續留置，應即轉移他項新工，俾人無閒散，物盡其用，故主管工程之機構，宜有專賣，庶能通盤籌劃，統一調度，此其一。</p>
<p>舉辦公共工程需要多數技術人員，此項人員必須預為儲備與組織，以免臨時凑集，曠日廢功，我國目前工程專才無多，應用之工具儀器有限，尤當集中力量，健全組織，統一指揮，以赴事功，此其二。</p>
<p>工程建設與行政管理性質不同，公共工程在施工時期，着重於技術，需要工程專才之處為多，公共工程完成以後，則成為公共事業，經營管理，需要事務人才之處為多，其情形自與施工時廻異，為求二者運用適當，各盡職責，故工程與管理，理宜分掌，不宜兼管，此其三。</p>

<h3>新上海文化建設的展望</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>抗戰勝利，租界交　，上海新市政府自成立以後，百端待理，而最大目的，就是在建設新上海。我們看到過去租界的一切措施，固然造成了上海的繁榮，而在文化事業方面，却是不加注意的。值得提出的，算是工部局的管　樂隊。最初亦不過專供西人欣賞，到後來繼有我國人參加。此外，只有圖書館和養成翻譯買辦人才的少數學校而已。前任吳　城市長，對此曾表示感慨。吳市長任內，在市中心建設了體育館，圖書館和博物館，這是上海市文化建設的初步成績。不幸在戰時都遭破壞了。現在市政當局要　　新上海，對於文化事業的建設，當然認為重要的，并且要積極進行的。關於圖書館的恢復，已　接收了前工部局的圖書館，暫時已足以　付。關於　　，　利用前租界裏各種場合，也可以　補應用，　時也不必多所考慮了。最近，聽說市政當局已　　一步在計劃設立科學實騐所，　是一個極好的消息，要代替研究科學的靑年們表示　　的。至於博物館的恢復，還沒有什麼消息。過去博物館的名稱　　　廣，而屋宇的建築，陳列的規模，似不能相　，在地方繁榮時期，思辦事業，尚　盡符理想，何况現在是大　之後，元氣未復的時候呢？博物館一時旣不易恢復，鄙見不如修正辦法，縮小範圍，設立一個美術館，這或許此　容易着手。將來經費寬裕的時候，另外再恢復博物館，亦無不可。科學實騐所成立之後，美術館就應該跟着進行。因為科學與　　的提倡，是應當同時並進的。</p>
<p>科學與美術，是現代文明的兩翼。科學是物質建設的原動力；美術是生活向上的原動力。國家要建設現代文明，兩者　一不可（在這裏，特別要紀念已故的蔣百里先生，他對於這個問題，認識得最深切。）專重科學而忽視美術，這是一偏之見，　　論也。誠然，抗戰勝利之後，我們緊急要做的工作，是建國。我們的建國，不僅是要求政治上的民主制度而已，主要的是在物質建設。我們要完成國家的物質建設，就需要科學，就需要科學的人才。聽說國民政府對於新中國的建設計劃，已經有相當的　　，準備　完步驟，分期實行，這工作的規模當然是偉大的。　　我們的科學人才，實在缺乏得可憐。政府方面需要如何　　　　，通盤計劃，造就各種科學人才，在這裏姑且不談。就上　情形　論，上海人民的科學水準，是比其他地方略高一籌，而各種研究的工具和設備，也比其他地方勝過多多。目前利用上海的　　，加緊培植，自然是當務之急。市政當局能在百端待理之中，注意到設立科學實騐所，可謂能見其大，能得其本。現在旣有舉辦的計劃，希望能從速實現。不但如此，我們更希望逐步推廣，由一所而至十所，由十所而至百所，並要由一般的而推進到專門的。不僅使在校的老師們學生們可以利用，同時要使學校以外的研究者，也有充分利用的機會。我想如果聯合起各學校各工廠各團體起來共同努力，這希望的達到，並非不可能的。</p>
<p>關於美術館的建設，目前或許要被認為是市政的點綴，可以從緩的。殊不知過去上海雖有文化中心之號，但從另一個角度看，却久蒙置辦文化之誚。在這市政更始之際，必須要有一個新的轉　，來一新觀感。美術對於人類思想生活的向止與提高，是最有作用的，也是最有效果的。從美術的製作方面說，是發揮人類的創造意志與創造力。從美術的欣賞方面說，是啟發人類的向上意志與同情心。美術的修養，能使人類生命　於最純潔，最優秀，最崇高的境界，這不是道德的訓導，法紀的約束所能比　的。蔡元培先生說到　　可代宗教，這真是一代大學者的真知灼見，値得現在一般　　教育文化者　　研索的。就最切近的情形而論，清潔整齊的　　，恆由愛　觀念的發　而養成，一切冷酷·自私·卑污下游的病態，亦恒由愛美心理的擴展而自然消　。至如一切工藝製作，由於觀　機會之多而自然競進，有助於工商事業發　的益處，更不待贅言。</p>
<p>美術的提倡，是應該　　的。所以希望市政當局在科學實騐所成立之後，就來準備設立美術館。在初步也不一定求其規模完備，　要建築適宜並有相當容量的屋宇，陳列中國的繪畫，雕塑及工藝美術三部門。然後逐漸推廣到本國人製作的西畫及雕塑。美術館的陳列品，顧名思義，當然應以造型　　為主。過去一般的作風，不明體要，只求各類之多，以致龐雜陸離，喧賓奪主。這種情形，必須加以糾正。倘一時不能有相當的經費來置備陳列品，則暫時不妨設法借私家的收藏，逐期更換。據個人聞見所及，上海敵偽產業中有不少名貴的美術品，不知負責當局如何處理？倘有切實的調查，由市政府設法接收，作為市立美術館的基礎，這是最理想的。同時為經常費的補助計，不妨在館中劃出一部分，專為借給各種展覽會之用，收取合理的費用，　在美術界方面，也是極表歡迎的。</p>
<p>我們知道目前市政　費支出造繁，當局正在　　緊縮。科學實騐所的設立，已經是難得之舉，何况希望要多設，更何况希望再設美術館？不過，文化事業，關係立國大計。家庭的　父母，尚且要節衣縮食，不辭勞苦，來維持子女們的教育費。政府的　長官，自亦得有賢父母的心腸，對於其他方面，可省則省，可免則免，惟有對於文化事業，不但不宜減省，還得儘可能範圍來擴充。希望今年—民國三十五年中，上海市有三個以上的市立科學實騐所，一個市立美術館，能夠成立起來。「一歲之計在於春，一日之計在於晨。」値此新年元旦，　　這一點小小的意見，願市政當局注意及之。</p>

<h3>上海市政的全貌</h3>
<p>—本報採訪室—</p>
<p>上海市經過戰爭的烽火，又被數僞百般的蹂躪；八年來市政的設施大　　於停頓狀態。今日勝利初臨，市府當局正面臨着千　萬緒的艱巨工作，而須積極的加以調整。本報爲欲明瞭三月來本市市政　展的狀况，特出動全體採訪人員分訪市政府及各局各單位，以期收集現實資料，向市民作一有系統的報導。</p>
<p>我們所提出的主要問題是：（一）自接收以來，三月中上海市政府及各局各機　對於本市行政及建設上最顯著的成績是什麽？（二）三月來市政上困難的　結在那　？（三）建設偉大的新上海市的中心計劃是什麼？（四）市府及各局各機構的工作效率如何？推動精神如何？</p>
<p>綜合我們的報告，我們所得的解答是：（一）在錢市長領導之下，市府各單位在過去三月中，雖然環境的阻力很大，工作的困難很多，然關於整頓過去的積弊，及推進全市建設都有很大成效，惟市民與市府接觸的機會不多，因此市府工作的情形，一般市民都很隔膜。（二）市府目前最大的困難是財政的支絀，一切行政建設在在皆需龐大的經費，在目前財政不能上正軌的時候，許多工作皆不能積極推行。（三）因時間及財力問題，建設新上海市的統盤計劃尙在難產的過程中，依照目前觀察，在短時期內，市府當局祇能傾力去恢復截敵偽破壞的各項設施而無餘力去推進建設新上海市的偉大計劃。（四）本市的各行政長官自市長以下皆是全國最有聲望的專門人才，各局局長障綫之强爲全國任何市所不及，然各局的組織目前尙欠緊凑，因此工作效率倘以工作人員的人數來做考核的標準，則尙不能達到理想的程度，辦事的手續在很多方面亦尙覺不能合簡捷的原則。</p>
<p>依據本報所收集的各項報告，市政府當前長重要的問題是：（一）在財政上須建立穩固的基礎，不但使收支能平衡，並得有相當的經濟力量去推進各項行政及建設的計劃。本市各項市政設施如推廣敎育，創設各種社會福利事業，興建新馬路，新碼頭，平民住宅，推行公衆衛生事業，加强警力，皆賴經濟的原動力。故目前最迫切之先決問題，皆集中在「錢」字。（二）推進市政建設須有一個整個計劃，制定全市五年或十年之建設，以使各項工作能有平均和合理的發展。依據我們的觀察，市政府應在短時期內將統盤的建設大綱，會同本市領袖來審愼硏究。俾上海市的建設可早日依據「藍本」而次第實施。（三）市政府一方面固然需積極的養成一般工作人員的廉潔。同時亦需在可能範開內逐步改善工作人員的待遇，俾上海市政府能仿照英美各國的先例，養成一般健全的，有專長的公務人員。</p>
<p>市政府</p>
<p>編者按：本文乃錢市長自撰之元旦論文，題曰「光復後之上海市政，」全文長約五千言，對於今後市政設施，分十大項目以爲闡明。本報今日旣特載市政全貌專稿，　市長之文，正堪冠弁篇首，爲之統率。惟文稿稍長，爲編輯形式計，乙段以下移登第五版。而以本報採訪室專稿緊接於甲段之後，閱者諒之。</p>
<p>今日爲中華民國三十五年元旦，亦即中華民國成立紀念日，我民國成立以來。飽經憂患，歷盡艱危，至去年而始獲得自由平等之地位，呈現光明燦爛之前途，加以八年以來，我同胞皆生活於戰爭之中，華於砲火聲中度其新歲，至今年而始苦盡甘來，熙熙　　，同慶昇平，斯實最可慶賀者也。</p>
<p>歲之始，各報業文，余意與其爲　泛之詞，無寗將過去三月餘來之市政設施，擇要紀述，旣可供自身據討之資，亦並爲市民了解之助，爰撰此文，以代論議，惟市政設施，千頭萬緒，茲分爲十月，述之如左：</p>
<p>甲·鞏固治安</p>
<p>上海爲國際都市，情形複雜，在敵僞八年盤據之後，盜匪猖獗，漢奸充斥，秩序紊亂，治安堪　，本人就任以後，即以恢復秩序，鞏固治安爲第一要務，其工作可分爲兩類述之：</p>
<p>一，　淸漢奸，防緝盜匪，本市自接收以來，對於調查漢奸行跡，搜集罪證，以及嚴密偵緝等項，無一不積極進行，經查緝及檢舉者計一二八件，共五七三名。至防緝盜匪，除加强警備力量外，並舉辦特種戶口檢查，民槍登記，管理　站碼頭旅店及其他公私塲所，拘捕散兵游勇，地痞流氓等，以杜匪源。計自接收迄今，破獲匪案五十六件，盜匪三百十一名，現正集中　力，從事防緝，以期肅情：</p>
<p>二，增强警力，充實警備　從量與質兩方面着手，就　言，則本市區域遼闊，現有長警，尙嫌不敬，正積極補充，以期充實。就質言，則提高應考資格，加强訓練工作，如甄訓敎育，新管敎育，補習敎育，皆在積極進行中。至充實警備方面，則組織車巡，騎巡，摩托車隊等分區巡邏，配合各分局，以確保治安。同時並組織保衛委員會，聯合社會各界，充實保衛團務，以分担保衛地方之責。</p>
<p>財政局</p>
<p>財政局長浦拯東</p>
<p>抗戰勝利以後，上海市財政局最先之設施爲廢除僞組織非法苛征之消費特稅與黃金特稅，而此二項特稅之收入，每月佔全市稅額達百分之七十强，驟然失之，挹注誠非易事。乃轉而整頓稅政積弊，剔除中飽，同時節省行政開支，充實建設經費，　　經營，工作至爲艱巨。按上海市地方稅捐，多屬零星，如屠宰稅，娛樂稅，筵席稅，牌照稅，旅棧捐，房捐等主要地方稅收，在敵僞時期，例如自卅四年一月起至八月底止，共所征各項捐稅以二百對一折合法幣計算，每月捐稅之平均數爲屠宰稅二、四〇九、七四〇元，筵席稅一五、四三四、五〇〇元，娛樂稅五、四二七、四九三元，牌照捐三六八、六五五元，旅棧捐二、二九一、五五一元，連同房捐九七一、一二四元、共計爲二六、九〇三、〇六三元。財局自九月二十四日開征至十一月底止，共計稅款四〇八、九八七、七四五元，其中九月份一六、四四七、〇八四元，十月份一一三，六二六、二七四元，十一月份二七八、八〇六、三八七元，十二月份預計可達五〇〇、〇〇〇、〇〇〇元左右，較諸僞政權時代，平均每月征收所得約增二十倍。就此數月來征收額依科目分別計算，則平均每月征收屠宰稅八四、〇〇〇、〇〇〇元，筵席捐一〇〇、〇〇〇、〇〇〇元，娛樂捐七四、〇〇〇、〇〇〇元，牌照捐一六，〇〇〇、〇〇〇元，旅棧捐二五、〇〇〇、〇〇〇元，共計二九九、〇〇〇、〇〇〇元。惟房捐因尙在重新估價，迄未起征，契稅附加，亦在不計之列。在最近之將來，稅收總額可望增至每月七〇〇、〇〇〇、〇〇〇元。此外中央征收各項稅捐中，應按百分率撥給市府者，營業稅約計四〇〇、〇〇〇、〇〇〇元，土地稅約計一五〇、〇〇〇、〇〇〇元，印花稅約計一五〇、〇〇〇、〇〇〇元。遺產稅約計五〇、〇〇〇、〇〇〇元，財產租賃出賣所得稅約計五〇、〇〇〇、〇〇〇元，共計八〇〇、〇〇〇、〇〇〇元，與地方稅捐收入相加，兩共合計每月共收稅捐一、五〇〇、〇〇〇、〇〇〇元。</p>
<p>就營業稅一項言，本市約可月征八〇〇、〇〇〇、〇〇〇元由中央征收，本市得撥到百分之五十。依實際行事而言，市府認爲此項稅收，如直接由本市征收，成該必較優良，因地方政府，對於本地市况，自較熟悉，易於稽征。且由本市稽征處附帶征收，不另設機構，則可節省開支，或能達到一、〇〇〇、〇〇〇、〇〇〇元，超過預計之數二〇〇、〇〇〇、〇〇〇元，則市府行政建設之費有着，毋須中央分撥其他稅捐，或尙可以超溢之營業稅二〇〇、〇〇〇、〇〇〇元撥歸中央也。</p>
<p>至於支付項下自本年九月十二日上海市政府成立之日起，至十一月底止，計九月份五六·八七〇·〇〇〇元十月份一·〇七九·六五〇·〇〇〇元，十一月份一·三七八·四三〇·〇〇〇元，共計支付二·四一四·九五·〇〇〇元，其中除開辦費三六〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇元，及警察制服費一·四九五·〇〇〇·〇〇〇元外，實支行政諸費共計五五九·九五〇·〇〇〇元。</p>
<p>房地　原穩本市重要收入，但目前本市房租，正在重新估計，尙未開始徵收。查前上海市區二十四年全年房地捐收入計二·七六〇·〇〇〇元，前法租界二十四年全年房地捐收入計五·八一〇·〇〇〇元，前公共租界二十六年全年房地捐收入計一六·三二〇·〇〇〇元，共計全上海三舊區之全年房地捐總收入爲二四·八九〇·〇〇〇元，如以六十倍計算，目前全年房地捐收入應爲一·〇〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇元，平均每月房地捐收入一三〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇元。</p>
<p>至於財政局三月來實施情形之犖犖大者，爲（一）釐訂稅捐制度，務求整齊劃一，與民更始；（二）調整征收機構，力求節省人力物力；（三）簡化稽征手續，剔除中飽，並免苛擾；（四）實施公庫制度，自十一月十日起，凡上海市府暨所屬機關所有稅捐及行政規費之各項收入，均由市銀行派員分駐各經征機關直接收款納庫，各經征機關僅負稽征之責。</p>
<p>此外，並設市公產監理委員會，市房租土地估計委員會，稅捐評議委員會。</p>
<p>財政局接收僞局職員名册，共計一千六百餘人，迭經裁汰，現僅有三百餘人以節費用，而增效率。該局爲杜絕　汚起見，並設密告箱，俾人民得以申訴。</p>
<p>局長浦拯東，字心雅，江蘇無　人，現年五十五歲，歷任財務行政，新聞記者，大學敎授，漢口市及重慶市臨時參議會參議員，漢口銀行公會主席，四聯總處貼放處長，交通銀行滬漢哈渝各大管轄行經理，重慶電力公司總經理等職。現任上海市財政局長，上海市銀行董事長，交通銀行中國農民銀行江蘇銀行湖北銀行江蘇農民銀行民生公司重慶電力公司太平洋保險公司等董事或常務董事。</p>
<p>社會局</p>
<p>社會局代理局長葛克信</p>
<p>在市政府所屬的各局中，社會局施政的對象，比較廣泛，無論是政治，經濟，社會，文化　方面，凡關促進社會的和諧與進步者都包含在內。</p>
<p>經歷八年戰學後的上海，所有的社會組織，早已破壞無餘，戰前我們國民經濟之生產運輸分配消費　過程是有機地聯　，現在脫節了，過去有系統的社會組織，現在沒有了，過去有一貫的文化傳統，現在是混淆了，過去本市房屋是過剩的，現在不够了，因而社會糾紛的　起是必然的事，問題的　結，不是在糾紛的多少而是怎樣加以合理調整使之正常化，物價穩定，生產恢復，勞實糾紛才有減少的可能，整頓社會組織，使各種團體能在政府領導下協助整個社會的復原，才能談到改革。</p>
<p>在今天，上海的情勢　予社會局的任務是多麽艱重，如果要建設敵僞八年來的破壞，整理敵僞八年來的損害恢復社會各部門的聯　，保持各階層的和階，正如整理一堆亂髮，需要主管長官和工作人員的忍耐和勇氣，審愼與合理的處理，才能從破碎支離的局面引上正軌。</p>
<p>當復員之初中樞特選任了吳紹澍葛克信兩氏担任正副局長，在千頭萬緒滿目瘡痍的病態社會中小心翼翼地遵照了已定國策和主席的訓示，分別緩急輕重，一一從新計劃，從新整理到現在爲止，雖離開我們的理想尙遠，但能在此極短時期內已能奠定了未來工作的基礎，却不可忽覦的上月吳氏因公務繁重辭去局長兼職後，現由葛副局長暫行代理。葛氏現年四十一歲，江蘇人，上海大學法學生。曾任國民革命軍三十三軍政治部秘書，漢口市黨部書記長，漢口市政府參議，武漢日報社評主幹，中央宣傳部專門委員，第三戰區司令長官司令部少將參議，上海市黨部執行委員兼書記長等職。</p>
<p>葛氏很和　地告訴記者說：本局過去三個月來的施政，因爲財政的因難，人力的有限以及其他各種不能避免的阻力，工作的進展顯然很慢，大抵是屬於渦渡時期性質的，其中主要者可分兩方面：（一）復員整理（二）社會安定。</p>
<p>關於復員及整理工作除整理舊有農工商社會文化乃至慈善性質的各種團體組織重行登記外，並擬訂各種章則，以便團體的組設或工作的進行。同時爲謀社會迅速趨向安定起見，曾舉辦各種社會工作如勞糾糾紛之調解，此項工作係根據收復區工資調整辦法處理，工資的決定，以生活指數爲依　，故勞資糾紛事件均在調解階段中解決而並無一件需經仲裁方式解決的。又如物價管制工作及評價委員會之組織，其目的在求消滅物價的波動性，協助各業集團採購，使生產早日恢復，民生稍蘇。另一方面，進行福利事業，如職業登記，勞工福利事業的改善，難民難童收容，公典的恢復，平民邨的整理，市府員工合作社的設立等。</p>
<p>接着葛氏告訴記者今後預定的工作計劃他說：「我們除了繼續完成未完的工作外，更擬具辦理若干新創的工作，隨手翻出了一份計劃書，送給記者看：計分經濟行政，社會組織，勞工行政，以及社會福利四大類。現在附錄如下：</p>

<p>末後，葛氏還希望新聞界在輿論上多予得促指導，並且還希望市民給予批許和協助。因爲社會局的工作與市民生活太密切了，絕對不可離開民衆的利益而單獨行動，所以市民的批評和協力是需要而迫切的。</p>
<p>公用局</p>
<p>公用局長趙會珏</p>
<p>所謂公用事業，大要不外水陸交通與水電煤氣等項，一現代化都市之繁榮，莫不與公用事業之發展息息相關。本市在復員之初，各項公用事業，資產混淆，設備殘壞，水電供應奄奄一息，交通工具稀少，電車，公共汽車，無不擴軋，如欲搭趁有如登天之難。特殊階級車輛不領牌照，水面航渡亦多停頓，入晚則路燈　暗，種種衰落現象，非可言喩。公用局對接收整頓之進行，首光組織委員會，除華中水電公司由經濟派員接收外，其餘各公用事業均由委員會，會同各公司原經辦人分別接收。交通方面，如電車公共汽車以及渡輪等，接收以後即交戰前原承辦人繼續經營，唯當局議訂原則三項：（一）事業不得稍有停頓，（二）一切資產應詳細查點列册，不得含　，如有損失，得依法向敵索賠，其中敵方增置之資產，則一律歸市府接收。（三）凡公用事業之工作人員，不問國籍，應享同職同薪之待遇，不得歧異。在此過渡時期中，本市公用事業，因而得未停　，而最感困難者，爲煤荒嚴重，當局乃邀集煤業航業界知名之士，組織上海市臨時燃料監理委員會，接管日方石炭聯合會，及其附屬煤　，統　支配，儘先　充公用事業應用、一面限制用煤，疏通來源，經二個月之努力，公用事業幸免中斷，此爲最苦難之時期。嗣後經濟部上海區燃料委員會成立，事有專司，乃告一段落。再爲調整價格問題，蓋各項公用事業受物價波動影響，收支差額過鉅，價格必需調整。其調整原則可槪爲三項：（一）力求全市價格之統一，消減戰前分區定價不合理之現象。（二）一方顧到市民之最輕負担，一方顧到各事業之最低成本。（三）注意小用戶之利益及各項工業用戶大量之需要。</p>
<p>三個月來，各公用事業經公用局督導整理，似尙不無進步，其較顯著者，如全市水電用量，目前已可不受限制；最重之工業用電，亦已恢復一部份，煤氣暫維現狀，但吳淞煤氣廠亦正積極籌備開工，即可擴充供應範圍。陸上交通，電車已恢復四綫，並增加二綫，公共汽車南市區之環城圓路，已於十二月十日通車，其他舊市區內各綫亦擬於短期內恢復。水上交通，浦江輪渡航綫，已自戰時之二綫擴充至六綫，民營濟渡，戰前原有三十五處，現已恢復二十六處。其他如舊市區之路燈，已增至三五五　，電話之接通比率已自百分之六十五增至百分之七十二。發電用煤，從前每度需用三·八磅，近已减至三磅。凡此種種，就目前觀察，固屬進步之現象。惟欲上海爲現代化都市，此區區成績，奚足稱道，其右待於推展改進者尙多。</p>
<p>記者爲欲明瞭今後公用局之計劃起見，特趨訪趙局長曾珏。趙局長是本市人，今年四十五歲，交通大學電機工程學士，美國哈佛大學電機工程碩士，曾在英德兩國實習多年，回國後歷任浙江大學副敎投，兼系主任。浙江省電話局局長，兼總工程師。浙東電力廠廠長。浙江工業改進所所長。交通部蘇·浙·皖·閩·贛·電政特派員。資源委員會，專門委員。交通部郵電司司長，及參事。中央設計局設計委員等職。趙局長體格魁梧，粗眉大眼，望之令人生畏，然與交談則和藹可親，故其屬員曰，我等怕之又愛之。</p>
<p>趙局長表示，上海電氣前途尙待發展，照統計倫敦（市每月每人之用電，平均爲一八〇度。而上海現僅四度，將來上海全部供電可能需要一百萬基羅華特之容量。電話方面，上海現平均九十人有一電話，而紐約每四人有一電話，故頗冀六個號碼之全部自動電話，早日採用。中央對於電氣，電話正計劃機成全國性之電氣，電話網，本市自當協助促成是項計劃之早日實現。自來水和煤氣爲都市中最便利而最衛生淸潔之給水與燃料，均應推廣使用。此項事業純　地方性質，本市亟應促其聯合管理，盡量發展。英商自來水公司之專勞合約，將於一九四七年期滿，法商自來水公司，則將於一九五〇年期滿，届時是否完全由市政府自辦，或國際共同投資，應審愼決定。交通方面，本市原有各交通綫非唯不够，且發展偏重於東西橫行，南北　綫則甚缺乏，爲促進都市發展。頗有組設一中外合資之交通公司之必要。該公司以聯繫之方式，經營電車公共汽車及輪渡。浦江渡輪亟應增多，則浦東一區亦大有發展希望。以上所述，俱可能在最近之將來，逐一實施，願四百萬市民盡最大之努力，促使上海成爲一完善之現代化都市。（下接第三版）</p>

<p>敎育局</p>
<p>敎育局長顧毓琇</p>
<p>蔣主席前曾昭告全國：戰爭期間置軍事於第一，戰爭結束後應以敎育爲第一，誠然，十年樹人，百年樹木，敎育興衰有關整個民族之前途，上海人口繁密爲文化中心地，政府特髮重視，任顧毓琇氏爲市敎育局局長，顧氏曾任敎靑部常務次長，中央大學校長，學者風度，樸素嚴肅，蒞任以後積極整頓市私立各中小學，提高敎職員待遇，充實圖書儀器節設備，且於今後本市敎育之改進擬有完備之計劃，茲特分述如下：</p>
<p>學校數量：本市現有市立中學十三所，小學一〇九所，附設幼稚園長二所，私立中學二二六所，小學五九四所，附設幼稚園一八五所，西僑學校三所，此外並有市立新陸師範及職業學校兩所，總計一、一五四所，以上海人口之多，此數顯屬不足，尤其小學更感太少。</p>
<p>學生人數：市立中學：五、〇六七人，私立中學五三、五四七人，共五八、六一四人，市立小學三五、四一三人，私立小學一三三、三九六人共一六八、八〇九人，市立幼稚園一、四五四人私立幼稚園七，二二〇人共八、六七四人，西僑中學三所及附小學二所幼稚園三所共學生六九三人新陸師範二〇六人以上總計全部學生總數達二三六、九九六人約佔全市人口百分之五强，換言之，本市市民二十人中僅有一人在受中小學敎育，若以每一家庭一學童平均計算之，此數至少應再加兩倍，即學童人數應爲市民人口總數百分之十五左右始爲合理，今無疑有兩倍於此之學齡兒童失學，此於國家社會前途之影響爲何如？</p>
<p>又市立學校數量顯屬不足，遂令學生不得不改入設備較陋之私校，尤其市立中學僅十三所而私立中學則達二二六所，約爲十七與一之比，學生人數則爲十與一之比，敎局以經費所限，維持原有學校已感支細，勢必無力再創新校，優秀淸寒之學子喁喁待哺，茍無助學金等項補助，失學人數必將更為增多矣。</p>
<p>市立中小學敎職員之待遇，僞府時代苦不堪言，茲已逐步調整與公務員一律待遇，即照底薪八十倍計算外再加生活津貼二萬八千元，俸給標準最高五二〇元（專校校長）最低六〇元（小學職員），令假定一普通中學敎師以底薪二五○元計可得俸給二萬元及津貼二萬八千元，普通小學敎師以底薪二百元計可得俸給一萬六千元及津貼二萬八千元，民衆學校敎職員俸給標準與小學校同，如上所述，家庭簡單之敎師巳堪溫飽。</p>
<p>市教育局現分設全市爲十六個敎育區，分別督導敎育事宜，尤特別注意學校分佈地域之平均，避免過稀過密，以減少學生跋涉之勞，又正在訓練國民學校校長舉辦小學敎師講習會，使皆能勝任愉快，廣設學術講座，俾便民衆進修，設市立科學實騐所於育才中學，使各設備不全學校少學生皆可輸流前往實驗，於學理進修當有極大之幫助，體育方面亦相當注重，現轄市中心體育塲，西門體有塲及市體育館，隨時發起各項競技，以增進市民之體格。</p>
<p>局務管理方面則分：一中等敎育處專管市私立各中學行政，二，國民敎育處，專管市私立各小學事務，將來或擬施行强迫敎育，三，職業敎育處，管理各職業學校及補習學校，且已設立上海市立專科學校及上海市立之補習學校各一所，四，社會敎育處，主要工作爲推行識字運動，及處理圖書館博物館，運動塲，演講會等事務，現又設音樂，勞作，美術三個中心站積極推進社會敎育，五，督察處，視察監督全市各學校之設施以謀今後之改進。</p>
<p>局方內部各職員之進修，顧局長深爲注意，特發起組織市敎育局同人進修會，由顧局長自兼主席，內部暫設：（一）讀書會，（二）研究會。（三）演講會，各處室同人可自由參加各組集會使於敎育制度及其他知識有充份之瞭解與修養，俾使增進行政效率，同人硏究所得如認爲確有重要敎育價値者，並將由局方發給獎金，以示鼓勵，此舉各地各機關大可仿行，於局務行政必有裨益。</p>
<p>最後，吾人希望在市敎育界種種不良狀况必須糾正，如衖堂中小學之存在實爲全國敎育界之恥，將來市校廣設後，私立學校除信譽卓著設備充善者外，自必將歸於淘汰，然目下此類學校無疑仍佔極大多數，其所造就之學生，素質低落無可掩飾，當局應先加以切實之調查，其過於簡陋勒令停辦，尙有可爲者嚴令其改進，又學生素質之需要提高，目前亦不容忽視，敵僞佔據以來，本市中學生素質方面日趨不良之情况深為嚴重，此舉應首先大量補充良好之師資，再提高學習精神，發揚硏究風氣，或尙不難恢復戰前之水準，然後可謀更進一步之提高，此兩點吾人認爲係目前敎育界之切要問題，全市市民均應協助當局決心達成崇高之目標。</p>
<p>民政處</p>
<p>民政處長張曉崧</p>
<p>隨着民國卅五年度的開展，第一件重要的民政工作，就是整編保甲；如何整編保甲，可從三方面來加以說明：</p>
<p>保甲的認識</p>
<p>第一，保甲制度是自治，而非官治的編制；這一點自民國二十八年中央頒佈縣以下各級組織綱要，實施新縣制後，更見具體化，保甲制度自是即被容納於自治組織之中，而爲鄕鎭內的　制，保設保民大會，甲設戶長會議，都是民意機構；他們可以選舉保甲長，也可以罷免保甲長，保甲長旣由人民選舉，而非政府核委，所以他們是自治人員，而非官吏。</p>
<p>第二·保甲制度適用於戰時，亦適用於平時。戰時固需要保甲，平時更需要保甲。因爲保甲是推行地方自治的細胞組織，如果這個基石不堅强，地方自治就無法完成。這次上海市整編保甲，也就是實行自治的先聲。不過都市編制保甲單位的大小，與縣各級組織綱要規定不同。依照市組織法第六條規定：「市以下爲區，區內之編制爲保甲，十戶至三十戶爲甲，十甲至三十甲爲保，十保至三十保爲區。」上海人口非常密集，交通也極方便，保甲單位以採取最大編制爲宜。故決定每甲以三十戶爲原則，不得少於十戶，多於三十戶；每保以三十甲為原則，不得少於十甲，多於三十甲。如此編制擴大。單位减少，不但運用靈活，抑日人力財力集中，各種事業容易主辦。</p>
<p>編查的程序</p>
<p>第一·編查的步驟：區劃應該是自上而下，編組應該是自下而上，根據上海市戶口分佈情形，以及交通形勢，經濟狀况，歷史關係等因素，將全市劃分爲若干區，每區復就所轄範圍內，以八百戶至九百戶爲原則，劃分爲若干整編段，這就是將來「保」的雛型。每整編段內復得以三十戶爲標準，劃分爲若干段，這就是未來的「甲」。整編段與整編分段劃成後，就可開始編查，先逐戶編查戶次，然後依據戶次淸册，編甲編保，順序推進。</p>
<p>第二·編查方法：將縣保甲戶口編查辦法第五條所規定之普通戶，船戶，寺廟戶，公共戶，外僑戶，特編戶，及臨時戶等七種，歸納於水上保甲和陸地保甲兩種。水上保甲以船戶爲編組單位，編成後附屬於常泊地之區公所。陸上保甲之編組，以普通戶爲基幹，而另以其他五種住戶心佐編組以成。</p>
<p>第三·編查的人員：除將各區劃分整編段及分段，產生段長及分段長主持其事外，並在各區成立整編委員會，與請區內熱輔自治人士，共同策劃辦理。一面由市府動員黨政軍機關與學校團體人員，分配至各整編段督導編查；並將設立講習會等，俾使各編查人員，熟悉保甲法令及編查手續。</p>
<p>應注意事項</p>
<p>第一·工作事效：爲了配合中央的方針，提早完成地方自治　以便實施憲政起見，次將於短期間內完成市以下各級保甲機構。時間迫促，不容稽延。所以編查工作，必須注意時效，務期迅速有效，但得如期完成。</p>
<p>第二·查詢方法：各編查員在出發編查前，應有種種充分的準備，查詢時態度要和藹，查詢手續和資料，務必完備和準確。</p>
<p>第三·編組的順序。本市編查時，應注意戶次順序；馬路街村自東而西，自南而北，數層以上之大樓，應自下而上等等是。</p>
<p>第四·表册呈報：這是編查結果的依據，應編造正確，按時呈報；如發現錯誤過多時，應責令重行編查。</p>
<p>地政局</p>
<p>地政局長陳石泉</p>
<p>談地政工作進展之前，先得要明暸土地行政的重要意義。因爲土地關係於民生的重要，所以土地方有行政上的意義。其次，講到土地的政策，可援總理遺敎中的兩句話一是「地盡其利」，二是「平均地權」。</p>
<p>所謂地盡其利，是土地政第的技術問題，要使人民均衡享受使用土地，並防止私人　斷土地，與限制投機，要使土地非因　本勞力改良所得的損益，歸爲公有，這就是平均地權的加稅政策，平均地權的實施方法，經規定爲申報地價，照價徵稅，照價收買，和漲價歸公四點。目前平均地權更爲經濟中心的重要問題，故應切實解決土地問題，務使地盡其利，才能够奠定民生的基礎。</p>
<p>上海經敵僞盤距八年，土地行政破壞殆盡；以致地籍紊亂，經界不淸，地權糾紛　起，而本市又雜有盟邦英美之產權，戰時曾遭敵强佔分割；再如前租界方面英法册道契的轉入日册，前法公董局在維希政權時所出售的公產，僞組織徵用的公私土地，人民地產在敵僞盤踞茶毒期間之買賣轉移等等，情形繁複，現決根據中央頒佈收復區土地權利淸理辦法，及地籍整理條例，在保障人民合法權益，及維護盟友產權之前提下，一一秉公處理。</p>
<p>四個月來工作的展開，着重於接收整理與準備實施的基礎工作，例如淸理圖籍表册，因所接收圖册，殘缺不全，須加核對，並依據八一三前本市的地政原有成果，加以整理，俾使按照圖籍，啣接淸理，目前中心工作，例如將舊特區呈准改爲黃浦區後，即趕辦該區的戶地測丈事宜。本市所轄區域，有卅二區，經已全部測量完成者有九區，其餘各區的測丈，正待陸續推進中，一方面並趕製戶地附圖九十萬張，及展開土地登記，換發所有權狀，需要魚鱗圖等。目前的工作，偏重於整理地籍的初期任務，此外關於積極工作方面，尙有土地登記，規定地價，淸查公地，調處地權等種種，其中土地登記一項，有其特殊的重要性，特加簡略說明如下：</p>
<p>倡導與協助</p>
<p>編制保甲，是一椿煩重的工作，也是實行地方自治的必要條件；成敗得失，關係建國的前途，至爲事大。上海市的人力，物力，財力，都餃優裕，編制保甲，也一定容易完成，保甲旣是自治組織，八人都有編制保甲的責任，在實施憲政的前夕，個個市民都有參加保甲工作的義務，希望地方賢達，隨時予以倡導協助，在政府與人民合力之下，來完成這椿重大的任務，這樣上海的市政，才有光明的前途，上海的自治，才有鞏固不拔的基礎。</p>
<p>現在負責領導整編保甲工作的是民政處處長張曉崧氏，張氏是中央軍校六期步科畢業，早年曾在寗波等地督導農民運動，爲黨奔走服務，民二十年曾任本市社會局視察員，二十五年任兪濟時將軍部隊之政訓處長。自八一三抗戰軍興，曾歷次參加瀏河，嘉定，北新涇，徐州，碭山，杞縣，開封等戰役。三十一年後，又歷任浙江新昌及餘姚兩縣縣長之職，在淪陷區內素以領導民衆，整編保甲，殲敵除匪，著名於時云。</p>
<p>土地登記，在辦理地政當局方面講，因登記而有了完備的籍籍，淸查可以便利，使政府對土地行政的施策，亦頗有裨益，而在人民依法聲請登記後，執有換發之土地所有權狀，人民產權，有絕對效力，政府予以保障；故第一次登記期內，希望市民所有產業坐落在黃浦，閘北，滬南，引翔，法華，漕涇六區者，迅速辦理登記，至於以前敵僞所發給的土地證件，根據中央法令是一律無效的。</p>
<p>對於永租契的處理，及敵僞所爲土地權利登記的淸理，土地估價等事宜，則正在迅捷劃分地價區段，調查合理地價，並參照民國三十年本市法幣尙在使用時期前法公　局及工部局僞組織所估地價册，採爲參考資料，目前正在繪製圖册，及實施調查中。</p>
<p>關於市有公地，最近初步統計，有一千一百八十六坵，合五千七百七十六畝，與僞組織公地册所列三百四十七坵，合一千五百另五畝相較，已多出八百三十九坵，合四千二百七十一畝，此項市有公地，現　設法盡量使用，務使本市無曠廢的土地，當目前上海「寸土寸金」的時候，在復興上海的市政規劃上，應竭力促進建設，例如由公家設置公共福利的建築，及平民住宅等，旣可減少市區房屋的恐慌，又可達到土地共享之目的。</p>
<p>現在領導推展本市地政工作的是地政局局長陳石泉氏陳氏曾歷任中央宣傳部委員，中央政治委員會專門委員，國民參政會第一，二，三，四，各届參政員，行政院參議，中央賑濟委員會委員等職，現任中央執行委員，國防最高委員會專門委員等職，以他豐富的經歷看來，本市地政工作的推展，雖是千端萬緒，艱鉅繁複，而其前程的光明，却是指日可待的！</p>
<p>衛生局</p>
<p>衛生局長兪松筠</p>
<p>衛生局局長兪松筠，年四十八歲，浙江吳興人，同濟大學畢業，德國漢堡大學醫學博士。曾任上海中德醫院院長，中德助產學校校長，江蘇省立醫政學院敎授，中央政治學校敎授，衛生署醫政處處長。於民國二十三年奉派赴歐美日本考察公共衛生及市政，回國後任江蘇省政府衛生設計委員會委員。三十二年任醫事人員高等考試典試委員等。兪局長並著關於醫學作品甚多，如衛生行政槪要，產科學，科學的達生篇，助產士職業論理學等。</p>
<p>衛生局行政範圍，乃按市府設置自治區計劃爲原則，將三至四個自治區合併成一衛生區，計全市劃成八個衛生區，每衛生區設衛生所一所及分所三至四所以推行工作。</p>
<p>關於本市市立醫院，據兪局長告記者，目前共有十所，包括二傳染病院，一監獄醫院，一戒烟醫院及一療養醫院，共計有病床九百七十五只，但按全市人口此例計算，至少應有五千只，市府當局計劃於明年度添二千病床，祇須有合適昨病院之房屋，即司立即着手進行。如市區內日本傷兵醫院騰出，此二千病床將不取問題。局方並已決定將前虹口篠崎醫院改爲平民產院，南市亦擬設平民產院一所，每院均可置病床五十只，將來於滬西尙擬添產院一所。至於私立醫院中，衛生局已接洽，約有百分之四十爲免費病床，一切費用均由局方担負。</p>
<p>本市醫師登記，迄至上週止，共計一〇五一人，均須備衛生署體書者方可合格，其中巳發執照者計六六〇人。外國醫師計二四五人，已有執照者爲一五〇人，中醫九五〇人，已登記者爲九二人，申請登記者共二六三人，牙醫生一七四人，發執照者七二人，登記者四〇八。又已有證醫之助產士二　三人及護士二二一人，鑲牙醫生計五十人。</p>
<p>關於里弄淸潔之整頓，前工部局時代，規定每十幢設置垃圾箱一只，執行頗爲嚴格。惟敵僞漠視此舉，破壞廢棄，迄今完好無缺者，所剩無幾，致里弄淸潔情况，日趨惡劣。今衛生局已設計垃圾箱圖樣，會同警察局警促各區趕製，務於一月二十日前全部設置究竣。現全市淸道夫包括小工，技工，垃圾夫二五〇五人，內淸道夫一二〇〇人，搬垃圾夫一二〇〇人，每日工作時間於晨四時開始至十一時，下午一時至五時。局方並設有服務組，居民如發現某里弄有不潔之處，均可電話一三四六九——四四，當即由局方派員前往調查整頓，聞此舉成績極佳。又如糞便淸除，規定每桶每月倒洗費用共計一百五十元，如有桶夫勒索等情，局方已編製號數，居戶可向局方報告懲罰。現衛生局已建議工務局以後任何建築必須裝抽水馬桶，以使减少此類不潔情形。</p>
<p>公共衛生方面，局方特設有衛生敎育委員會，集中專家設計衛生事業。藥品食物檢騐所，及水騐所均經常檢騐食品及水之淸潔，並每日檢查菜市，屠宰塲，販畜單幫等視察肉類是否新鮮。</p>
<p>至於本市衛生計劃，錢市長及兪局長均異常關懷。決以平民街生爲原則，首擬設立平民食堂，務使合乎經濟，衛生，簡單之目的，每人進食前均須洗手保持淸潔。俟經費充實後，尙擬普遍設置公共衛生浴室，廢除種種不衛生之舊習。市府並擬舉辦保健會，使人人能出少數費用而享受醫藥保護之權。一方面則予平民醫藥救濟，按時注射預防針，最近爲預防白喉傳染，已普遍於每學校，爲各員生注射白喉預防針等。俟善後救濟總署救濟物資到滬後，衛生局將充實本市一切衛生設施，以利全市數百萬居民之健康。</p>
<p>警察局</p>
<p>警察局長宣鐵吾</p>
<p>上海市警察局宣鐵吾局長，是一位歷任軍政界要職的良吏，剛毅幹練，經騐豐富。他是黃埔軍官學校第一期畢業，陸軍大學將官班畢業，曾任中央憲兵第四團團長，國民政府警術司令部參謀長，陸軍第八十八師參謀長，軍事委員會侍衛長，浙江省保安處處長兼特別黨部特派員，杭州警備司令。浙江省兵役管區司令，浙江全省防空司令，金蘭警備司令，陸軍第十預備師師長，陸軍第九十一軍軍長。財政部緝私署署長。勝利後，上海地面遼關，警政腐敗不堪，中央特命宣氏來滬主持警務。昨日記者走訪宜氏，他說：「中國自從開始辦理警察，一直到現在，可以說：沒有辦好過。所以一般社會，無論是在大都市，是在小城鎭，人民對於警察，已經有了很深的成見，只有厭惡，只有鄙視，在中國談起做警察工作，幾乎是一種差恥與侮辱。彷彿誰進入警察範圍，誰便沾汚了，其實警察是與人民關係最密切的行政人員。我們看到世界各國也在辦警察，他們的警察只是人民的保姆。所以我們必須把中國警察辦好，使其完全同於各國警察，同樣成爲人民的保姆。我們是抱了這種觀念來接辦上海警察的。</p>
<p>上海又和內地警察，有了很大的區別。一百餘年的租界，列國在不平等條約的特權下，把上海造成了一個特殊世界。上海租界時代的巡捕，當然有異於外國的警察，他們多少有些是和殖民地相類似的作風，成爲推行帝國主義的爪牙或工具。八年抗戰的混亂僞組織與敵寇統治時代，又把上海巡補和警察變了性質，「江河愈下」。幾乎可以說：警察成爲人民的寇警。我們是在這樣環境下，來接辦上海警察的。</p>
<p>現在我們只做了三個半月的工作，在敵人投降以後，我們從僞組織手上接收過來的警察局，其惡劣程度，正和整個上海的混亂成了正比例，敵人和僞軍槍彈的流散，更增重了我們的負擔。我們在這一個短短時期內，得到了多少成就，不須我們自己有什麽誇張。公道的人，自會有正當的評論，我們的辛苦，也已經獲得安慰。可是我們總覺得上海一般社會對於我們還不够了解。我們感覺還需要作一種必要的解釋。</p>
<p>一般人民所應當知道的，過去租界辦巡捕，是爲推行租界政令，所以巡捕的工作，是必須與租界政策配合的。我們不能否認租界政業類似殖民地政策。後來僞組織接收了巡捕，改爲警察。敵人統治下的偽組織，是「小朝廷」，日本軍憲高於一切，警察是奴隸爪牙，自也必須與敵人的奴役政策相配合的。現在我們來辦警察，我們是在國家主權收回以後第一任合法的中國警察局，我們受命國民政府，當然要秉承政府的政策，也就是要和絕大多數國民所擁護的三民主義政治相配合。也就當然和類似殖民地的租界政策相配合的巡捕，及敵人的奴役政策相配合的偽警察，截然的不同了。</p>
<p>我們的任務，在保安，在正俗。我們警察人員，在目下所應急切從事的工作，當然以防範和逮捕盜匪爲首要，敵僞流散的槍彈太多了，我們的警力也太薄弱。司是這二三個月我們對於盜案破獲，也有顯著的成績我們期待着短時期內的肅淸。因爲上海道路過狹，車輛的擁塞，行路也常常有生命的危險，警察負保安的實任，我們劃分若干幹線，規定車輛種類的行馳，加强交通管制以後，肇禍案件大减。正在俗一方面，租界時代，上海往往被人指爲「萬　之藪」，這也正是推行類似殖民政策後的必然現象。租界當局往往全不顧到中國的政令，尤其對於中國的善良風俗全不理會。所以淫亂邪毒，造成上海一切罪惡，我們當然不容許這些汚垢繼續存在，一定有一番改革。爲的是我們警察工作需要配合政府的政策，這是最明白不過的。</p>
<p>在我們配合政府政策推進工作中，自然會遭受到一部份的阻得。多少生活在上海的中國人，過去時代的租界，已經把他們麻醉了，他們已經被上海同化了，他們習慣了上海的生活，他們只覺得租界一切都是好的。這些人，假使不說他們是腐化（陳腐）份子，就可說他們是保守派，他們當然是落伍的一羣。還有一部份自私自利的人，他們只知道個人有利，沒有大公之心，不願意顧到公家的利益。因爲他們從過去租界時代敵為時代，得到了的私利，現在就要想保持着。對於我們爲公衆謀福利的舉措，他們也要起來反對。而不知時代的輪子，是不斷的在向前轉進，這班保守份子及自私自利的人們，一會兒就會落在時代的輪子後面。我們要跟着時代前進，希望一切保守份子和自私自利的人們，能改變他們的觀念。尤其希望社會前驅主持與論的人們，起來喚醒一般社會，了解我們警察的工作使我們得達成社會保姆的任務。</p>

<h3>元旦獻詞</h3>
<p>— 湯恩伯</p>
<p>民國三十五年元旦，是從苦難中　　出來的光榮，是從死戰中　　　來的　　，是何等的値得我們歡忻鼓舞的紀念和慶祝。然而怎樣來　　　勝利的光榮，確保　和平的佳果，這是民國三十五年主要的　題。　在歲首，必須要審慎　　的考慮，以痛定思痛的精神，以刻苦自勵的　度，來打下第一塊建國工作的基石。</p>
<p>我以為建國的前提，　在國家的統一，　　是政令和軍令，都不容許有紛歧破裂的現象。國人是如此看，國際是亦如此看。中國的古訓，「　精與一，允　　中」，便道破這　世　　的原理。　蔣主席領導我們從　　　　的軍　統治下，建立起國民革命的鮮明旗幟，又從　強兇暴的敵寇蹂躝下，爭取到自由和平的光明前程。他本身是站在一個救亡圖存的責任上，代表了整個國家民族和人民的利益，全國人民也是站在一個救亡圖存的責任上，代表了整個國家民族和自身的利益。目標一致，立場一致，這才凝結成一個偉大的力量。它有重心、有方向的表現出來，決不會因為某部分的利益，某個人的私慾，而有所動搖，有所損害。這就是說：在全民抗戰統一建國的洪　下，是沒有反動力量可以　　它的。不過希望國人要回憶歷史一下，歷史上割據　　民不聊生的血斑污點，這是誰給我們的？——敵人和匪類。同時也要體察現實，現實的自由和平歡忻快樂的勝利光輝，這是誰給我們的？——領袖和國家。在這個比　觀之下，擁護統一的國家，擁護英明的　領袖，便和我們的生命呼吸一樣，須臾不可離開，須臾不可隔絕。三十五年歲首，我願國人首先有這點認識，立下這點主張。必須在這一年，擁護我們的國家，在英明的領袖下統一起來。誰反對，誰破壞，都是我們的公敵。</p>
<p>其次，建國的目的，自在民生的安定。八年來顛沛流離苦而無吿的陷區同胞，我們應該及早使他們得到安息。然而我們知道在敵人的統治下，　兵的燒殺淫虜，匪類的欺　詐　，乃至於不肖豪紳官吏和　　部隊，都是在敲骨吸髓。這種暗無天日，慘無人道的情形，誰聽着都要掉淚，誰見着都要酸鼻。我們勝利了，敵人的殘暴，自然不會再存在，但是內在的危機，我們必須要去清掃。我在江南治安會議席上表示了安定治安的決心，提示了取締苛　的意見。我將不顧一切地來排除危害治安戕賊民生的障礙。不過軍事方面，僅僅是有形的力量，正是「野火燒不盡，春風吹又生」，根絕的工夫，還希望黨政同志和地方　達及全體的人民，　策　力的來完成這個工作。我們可以這樣講：有統一的局面，才有安定的民生，也可以說有安定的民生，統一才更有基礎。所以我想三十五年，我們必須致力於此，誰反對、誰破壞、都是我們的公敵。</p>
<p>政府是人民的公僕，軍隊是人民的武力。我們在勝利的第一年，我們都決心作這個　之無甚高的計劃。但是我們相信這確確實實是建國的基礎，必須在奠基的時候，樹下萬世不拔的根本。</p>
<p>謹以所感，卿作　詞。</p>
<h3>如何復興紡織工業</h3>
<p>— 潘士浩</p>
<p>一，注重國營乎抑並重民營乎</p>
<p>紡織工業為富世輕工業之重鎮，在戰事以前，英國美國及日本均賴以支持國力，蔚為輸出貿易之大宗，戰事以後，工業失其常軌，然除日本外，英美諸先進國當能重振斯業，以發揚光大之，且進而仍成為國力之重心，則斷斷元疑也，我國向為工業落後之國，而輕工業中之勉可稱道者，亦惟紡織，政府近已將全國劃為幾個棉紡織工業區，以助長其事，蘇浙皖三省指定為第六區，對於各該區棉紡織事業之注重，當不待吾人之催促也。</p>
<p>惟於此應首先注意者，今後之棉紡織業究注重國營乎，抑民營乎？換言之，即担當此輕工業之重任者，將為政府乎，抑為民間乎？查戰事以前，此業本不入於國營之列，而一般論者，僅以洋商華商分類，戰事以後，英美廠商深受摧殘，及勝利來臨，敵偽工廠，由政府接收開辦，則國營部份，始猛然抬頭，政府且設置中國紡織建設公司以管理之，其資本除接收敵偽紡織資產由經濟部估評價格外，再加國幣十億元，設總公司於上海，必要時得在國內外各地設分公司辦事處及工廠，其營業範圍為</p>
<p>甲，紡織品之製造及染整，</p>
<p>乙，紡織染原料與成品之購銷，</p>
<p>丙，紡織染機器與零件之製造及購銷，</p>
<p>丁，與前三項業務有關事業之經營，</p>
<p>戊，其他紡織染整有關事業之投資，</p>
<p>以言規模，不可謂不大，但據統計，匯款單我國紡織業重心之上海，其設備可列如右：</p>
<p>紗錠（枚）　綫錠（枚）　布機（台）</p>
<p>接收廠　九六三、四九二　二三四、〇二〇　一六、九七四</p>
<p>民營廠　一、六三六、七八八　一〇九、九八二　三〇、四四一</p>
<p>則生產能力，民營似在國營之上，又據紗錠之已開工者為</p>
<p>國營　一九三、二八五枚</p>
<p>民營　一、一七四、九四二枚</p>
<p>織機之已開工者為</p>
<p>國營　三、八七一台</p>
<p>民營　九、一一七台</p>
<p>二，民營廠商應如何復蘇</p>
<p>由前之說，今後之紡織工業，似當注重於民營，然民間企業家於此，將如何準備以承担此重大任務乎，技術之　改進，設備之　刷新，與　管理之當　頓，一　人　　言之，我人雅不願再　老生常談，但天下亦　常談中乃含有千古不變之真理，則此真理之應如何認真發揚光大，要不容忽視也。</p>
<p>抑猶有進者，今之世界交通日益便，國際關係日益切，舉凡關稅壁壘，匯兌限制，與夫輸出入之人為的統制，似非輕易所能做到，觀於美國所創導之國際貨幣協定，即可瞭然，則紡織工業將如何成為生產事業之重心，並進而為國際貿易之利器，企業家應深深自省，有所覺悟，着眼國際市場，調整同業步驟，均為當務之急，　居今而仍以一個公司或一個工廠之發財為本位，一味以等待政府配給敵偽工廠為捷徑，則中國之紡織工業，將永永不得抬頭矣。</p>
<p>惟在民間立場，處應力　上進，而為政府着想，凡有可以助長之者，終當不　緊瑣以為之，於此，我人不得不鄭重提出一問題，曰亟應救濟敵偽強迫收買紗布之損失，以蘇其元氣也，　棉紡織工業之資產，曰因定資產，機器廠房等是也，曰流動資產，原料製成品等是也，其賴以運營者，尤賴原料，然試往各家棉紡織工廠一為巡視，其所存之原料及製造品，蓋不及戰前之什一，今雖努力開工，其原料之不齊，及製品之不敷應市，情景可慘，問之，則曰民國三十二年八月敵偽之強迫收買紗布，已將紡織業元氣摧殘過半矣。</p>
<p>民營紡織業根底之深，及其開工之努力，宜値得吾人之重視，考英美先進國紡織業之發達，向為國人這所欣羨，但未聞以國營支持之，且據國防最高委員會所定第一期經濟建設原則，我國經濟建設事業之經營，必須遵照總理遺教，為有計劃的實施，以有計劃的自由經濟發展，逐漸達到三民主義經濟制度之完成，對於經營方式，儘量鼓勵民營企業，又經明定除郵政電訊兵工廠鑄幣廠主要鐵路大規模水力發電廠等外，惟有為民力所不勝，或政府認為須特別重視之事業如大規模石油　，銅鐵廠及航空事業政府得單獨經營或與民　外資合　，則紡織業本不在國營預定計劃之中，意者敵偽紡織工廠接收伊始，廠數旣多，頭緒紛繁，而其將如何支配為民營，又非短時期所能決定，乃以中國紡織建設公司之國營為之過渡乎？按該公司章程申有規定曰。</p>
<p>〔公司營業年限定為二年，必要時得　准展期一年，以一次為限〕</p>
<p>政府之不頤永久以國營的立場，支持我國紡織工業，當可昭然，　孜人於此，不　　有　矣，抗戰八年，幸　　　，國計民生，勞　　矣，今後整舊佈新，發揚光大，正舉國上下，官民互助之時，凡民力所　及，及民意之所　　者，政府應立於　　地位，助長其　　，與民爭利固其政府之所　出，分心企業，亦　百端待理之時之所應有，甚望上述之「過渡」時期，能儘量縮短，而將其生產機構，分批歸民營，以免國營民營同時　存之不便，則紡織工業之重心，庶幾能安定乎？</p>
<p>凡留心嚴時　仍政府之舉措者，當不忘三十二年八月九日強迫收買紗布之一幕，當時限期自八月二十三日起，開始　理出　申請，至九月六日截止，共得所　申請　表七千八百八十七份，共收　之　　　。</p>
<p>棉紗　九二、〇八一件　八九五小包　一、一七〇筒子　二二四支</p>
<p>白布　一、一九一、七四八、八一件　一、一二七、六七一·五九碼　一六四段　二、一一二·五〇碼　一、〇〇〇公斤</p>
<p>加工布　四、八五六、四四七、七四件　六、六五一、四二三·九七碼　二九、八三〇段　一二〇、二六七·二五碼　五、五五一·五〇公斤</p>
<p>總計上閒，應為紗九二、一〇三件，布六、四四〇、八八〇疋，此龐大之數字，皆出於上海一市紡織業及棉布業歷年辛勤之所積，當時一掃而空，　中人血與淚併，我人當不難想像其損害之重大也。</p>
<p>偽商統會將於此項紗布，亦曾極力設法保全，截至抗戰勝利，敵偽屈膝，政府派員接收，聞尚有存紗一萬餘件，布三百餘萬疋，此乃偽政府以非法手段，強奪民營企業之商品，以理而言，仍應查明實數，照總損失數比例發　，庶紡織工業之元氣，可賴以稍稍復蘇，此在政府第一舉手之勞，於國庫毫無損失，而企業家則普受其利，　諸停廠停業以待盟邦救濟者，其相去為如何耶？</p>
<p>收買紗布之損害如能於短期內獲得補救，則元氣稍復，脚跟自穩，在政府秉政者再進而以工業貸款，及配給敵偽移存染料以接濟之，在民間身富企業之任者，則節約使用，改進出品以振作之，民營紡織工業未始不可復蘇也。</p>
<p>三，國營民營應如何携手</p>
<p>國營雖為過渡，然在此過渡期內，應如何與民營携手乎，此亦値得討論之問題也。以現狀而言，在設備與技術方面，首應携手，蓋國營各廠，接自敵偽，其在上海者，如內外·豐田·日華·同興·大康·上海等廠，設備多屬良好，在戰事以前，民營染色整理廠之坯布，約有四分之三，向其購用，今收歸國營，開工範圍未廣，而民營各廠之受有戰事損失者，機器不無殘缺，正宜相與聯絡，或將呆置未開工之機器酌量分租一部份與民營，則變無用為有用，於國營廠無所損，於民營廠則受益矣。至於技術人員本出於民營各廠，現在國營各廠，因人手缺少，不得不留用一部分敵人在內，此事豈可久長，民營各廠正應予以協助，聽其調用，務使人盡其用，生產事業得以整個推動，則將來國營廠議歸民營時，國人自能駕輕就熟，各得其所，其次如國營各廠所出之製成品，將來如何發賣，亦應與民營廠家合作，其出品之種類，應儘量避免與民營相衝突，換言之，即民營廠所能普遍生產者，國營廠應即少製，民營工商業亦應予以協助，如業務成為聯系，出品不致侵乹，指臂之效旣得，整個紡織工業日入正軌，近日民營各廠，多抱一種恐慌，以為國營各廠雖已閒工多日，迄未開始發售，如將來發售時，標價過低，民營廠即不勝其壓迫，此雖似民營廠過分重視其本身利益，然國營廠之原料，出於接收敵偽之物資，或借自盟邦之　　品，成本可抑至極低，固井民營廠所能敵也。</p>
<p>再如原料一項，今之國營廠勝於民營廠多矣，染料紗布之原來堆積在接收廠中無論矣，即推而至於在德孚洋行等進口商行　房中者，當局亦未明白宣示可提若干配給民營，為整個紡織工業着想，要當加以　節，進口原料，二三個月以內即可旺到，國營廠可由政府出面向國外定貨，今日之所堆積者，世為將來之所多餘或過令者，如能趕撥若干以接濟民營，則可收入相當之資　，用於定　　用之極少貨品，　謂當局，應鄭重　意之。</p>
<p>國營各廠之已開工者，同開工矣，而未開工者是否必須仍占為國營，當局尚應加以考慮，今有小型敵廠四十餘家，着手估價標賣，其中除數廠外，大多規模狹小，不足以資展佈，然民間企業家之有意申請承購者，已有多起，於此可見民間對於可資生產之工廠，其需要為何等迫切，則國營各廠，似應擇其不即開工者，租賃若干與民營，我人如為整個紡織工業着想，當不以此部為多餘也。</p>
<h3>如何訂定匯率問題</h3>
<p>— 劉大鈞</p>
<p>抗戰勝利結束之後，大家對於外匯匯率又有不少的討論，而且討論的重心在於新匯率水準的高低，與改訂的時日。在戰事期中，雖然也有人論及這個問題，但因當時很少正常的外匯業務，所以對於改訂匯率，還不感覺有迫切的需要，討論的人只是未雨綢繆而已。現在國際交通逐漸恢復，我國對外不久將重建國際貿易關係，於是已往的外匯官價不能繼續維持，而必須改變，乃為一般人所公論。政府對於此事也有肯定的表示，所以尚未實行改訂者，不過新匯率水準一時還難確定而已。</p>
<p>有人以為改訂的時間甚關重要，因為目前國內經濟狀態還在動盪不定之中，無從覓得適當的改訂標準。更進一步也可說經濟旣未　安定，即或另訂新匯率，也不長久維持，而仍須繼續調整。作此說者認為與其一再改訂，不如暫時聽其自然，等到適當時期，國內經濟漸形安定之後，再行規定新匯率，庶可一成而不易。然而一國國內經濟與其國際經濟關係不能分離：當國際經濟關係正在逐漸恢復之時，國內經濟狀况實無從安定，而外匯匯率本身，直接地影響前者，間接地也影響後者。如果政府仍舊維持原來的官價，一面繼續結價的辦法，控制一部分的輸出外匯，一面嚴格審核　人商及其他　要外匯者的申請，那麼我國國際經濟關係仍不正常，即使國內經濟　　穩定，狀態也決不能持久。一般人皆知如此　　戰時的外匯政策是短期的辦法，已足以引起不安定，何况市場匯率，在這個前提之下，發動的幅度一定很廣，尤成為引起一般經濟波動的因素。我認為在半年或一年以內，甚或兩三年內，希望國內經濟安定，恐不可能；我們所僅能希望的，是減少經濟波動的幅度。所以在戰事未結束以前，我就曾根據這個看法，說明匯率改訂之後，必仍須經過幾度的調整。</p>
<p>反過來說，如採用合理的辦法調整匯率，雖不能安定國內經濟，而至少可以減弱牠的動　。匯率經如此調後，國內物價可與國外物價逐漸接近；兩種物價的差額減少，匯率本身的波動也可減弱。這原是按照購買力平價規定匯率的論據。近來很多人以為國內物價不安定，收復區與後方的物價仍有很大差額，即在各收復區物價也不一致，於是認為購買力平價學說在我國此時不便適用。他們大約要等候國內物價恢復一致以後，再行調整匯率。此說雖然似有理由，然事實上無法分為兩個時期，第一期先調整國內物價，第二期再調整國內物價與國外物價。況且如此進行，也與穩定我國經濟無益。</p>
<p>我國各區域間的交通工具甚為缺乏，需要很長的時間，方能貨暢其流，屆時各區域間的物價才能漸趨一致。所謂「一致」，也並非說他能完全相同，不過各區域間物價的差額只代表必須的轉移費用而已。（此項費用不以運費一項為限，而包括其他「轉移的費用」，就是瑞典學者俄林敎授在他的「區際與際質易」一書中所說Costof　transfer。）</p>

<h3>設立工程專管機構議</h3>
<p>— 陳茹玄</p>
<p>（本文上接第一版）</p>
<p>是以歐美各邦，多有工程專管機構之設置，如美國之聯邦工程署（Federal　Works　Agency）公共建築局（Public　Building　Administration）,英國之工程及建築部（Ninistry　of　Worksand　Buildings）工程與設計部（Ministry　of　Works　and　Planning）建設部（Minister　of　Reconstruoton）皆是也。</p>
<p>我國主管公共工程之權稱，在秦代有「將作」，漢代有「將作大匠」，隋唐以迄宋元明清則有「工部」，皆為專管性質，民國以選，對於公共工作之建造事項，均分屬於各管理機關，如交通部掌鐵道公路電訊造船等工程，軍政部　營房及軍需倉庫等工程，經濟部當動力及工鑛廠房等工程，農林部及水利委員會　農田水利等工程，市政府掌道路消埠及衛生等工程，是在無大量工程建設，或僅事工程之維持保養，固可勉以就會，若建國工作積極推動，在大規模的建設計劃　待開展之今日，以目前機構之紛繁，人才之分散，各方之需求不一，主張紛歧，緩急先後之間，尤難免於爭衡，欲期各項工程推行盡利，實為問題，僅就鐵道一項而論，交通部路政司旣主管已成各路之經營管理，復須負責已毀舊路之修復，與新路之建築，勢難勝任愉快，就會裕如，又如東方北方南方大港之建設，規模宏大，亦斷非一市政府或其他行政機構之力量所能兼任，</p>
<p>回憶在搞戰初期，飛機　之建築向由航委員會負責，工程與管理合一，洎緬局突變，國際通道隔絕，空運之需要激增。機　之擴建急切，我　領袖高瞻遠矚，有鑒及此，因於軍事委員會下特設工程委員會，主辦是項工程，以職責專，一人力集中，指揮靈使，調度迅速，故工程縱極鉅大，工限縱極迫促，悉能達成任務，以供軍需，此最近之實例，殊足為今後建設之圭臬。</p>
<p>故吾人以為國家積極從事建設，為期責任專一，力量集中，應設工程專管機構，棣屬於行政院，以主持全國之工程建設，庶事　統一，迅赴事功，且對於對外接洽利用外交，亦可國職有專司，而免各部紛歧，彼此爭衡之弊，</p>
<p>至此項機構旣屬專管工程，故于工竣以後，即應按其性質，移交其他行政機關分別管理，經營，庶工程建設與行政管理分工合作，各盡其最大之運用，</p>
<p>復次，關於此項工程專管機構之業務範圍，槪括言之，可別為三類：</p>
<p>（一）主辦部份　凡不屬於中央各部會及地方政府主管範圍以內之各項工程建設，如開關港埠（國父指示之東方南方北方三大港等，）航空基地，國防要塞，公共建築，以及技術人員之訓練等屬之，</p>
<p>（二）代辦部份　凡屬於中央各部會及地方政府主管範圍以內之各項工程建設，如鐵路公路之趕修，河道水壩之竣築，電氣電力之設備，工廠都市之建造等，均可隨時由中央指定或各機關委託代為辦理，工程完竣後即移交主管機關接收。</p>
<p>（三）合辦部份　凡友邦投資或中外合資創辦之事業，得因其技術合作或任何特別之使得，由中央隨時交辦；</p>

<h3>光復後之上海市政</h3>
<p>— 錢大鈞</p>
<p>（自第二版「市政府」段轉來）</p>
<p>乙·調整社會經濟</p>
<p>經濟措施，與民生息息相關，面其庭理，亦至不易，本市雖爲工商業會萃之區，然經敵僞剝創八年，致　員之初，社會經濟萎　　　，亟待調整發展，爰　可能，力加扶助。</p>
<p>一、評定物價　經設立評價委員會，各業價格如須提高，令飭先行提請該會共同評定，再予核准，以收調節與和綏之效，並通知各同業公會，按週查報物價，　送本府，以憑查核而資調整。</p>
<p>二、調節民食　民食事項，除由糧食部特派員通盤主持，本府亦特派專員，督導米業，將米市塲先後恢復，一面將米業行號在敵偽時代所有一切限制，悉於解除，回復自由買賣，與自由採購辦法，並經擬具辦法，令飭該業集團採購，以裕來源。</p>
<p>三、統　燃料　本市復員之初，煤荒嚴重，爰採緊急措置，設立燃料臨時監理委員會，負責接管存煤，統籌支配，故於收復期間，各公用事業幸免中斷，嗣後經濟部上海區燃料管理委員會成立，始將該項業務移交該會辦理。</p>
<p>四、調整公用事業價格　本市公用事業，以經長期摧殘，亟待整修補充，職工待遇，應予調整，並以所需林料價格飛漲，確已陷於無法維持地步，乃接受各公司請求，根據顧全市民負担及維持公司開支兩項原則，准將價格試行調整。</p>
<p>丙·舉辦救濟事業</p>
<p>本市自經戰爭破壞，敵偽摧殘後，一般平民生活極感苦痛，深爲政府所軫念，救濟之舉，實爲當務之急。</p>
<p>一、失業工人之救濟　復員以來，以接收各敵僞工廠，不免暫時停頓，加以物價高漲，動力未充，以致失業工人生活極爲艱困，而勞工風潮亦時有發生。計三閱月來勞資爭議案件，達七百廿九件，大都均經調解或勸導後自行和解。至失集工人之救濟，已會同社會部駐滬辦事處及有關各機關組織委員會積極辦理，惟此項救濟，尙係消極性質，根本之圖，厥爲從積極方面　手，即舉辦勞工福利事業，以減輕其生活之困難。此項工作，如調查各工廠原有勞工福利設備，檢查各工廠衛生安全等設備，提倡勞工消費合作社，舉辦勞工電影等項，均在設計進行中。</p>
<p>二、一般平民之救濟　首爲籌設市立救濟院，已先成立難民難童收容所，前後收容千餘人，尙擬設法擴充。次爲舉辦冬賑，組織冬令救濟委員會，網羅慈善界各領袖，共同辦理，次爲辦公典及平民邨，第一所公典業巳開辨，第二所即可成立，平民邨四所。已加整理，尙擬陸續推廣。至興建平民住宅，已初步設計完成。</p>
<p>丁·整頓全市交通</p>
<p>交通事業，與市民福利關係最切，本市交通原極發達，自經敵偽破壞，遂趨衰頽，故本府接收以後，不得不力圖整頓，以免影響市民生活：</p>
<p>一、道路方面，在黃浦區（舊租界區）急須塡補之路面約卅四萬平方公尺，溝渠尤須全部疏通，且全市各區道路系統，過去因行政權未能統一關係，極不整齊，必須全部整理修正。又幹道偪仄，交通擁擠，亦須逐漸計劃拓寬。以上各項，均已依據初步整理計劃，大體完成。至交通工具，除原有外，並籌復公共汽車，先就滬南區恢復行駛，及整理小型鐵路，維持上川上南兩路每月往返各二次。此外各區路燈，過去大都拆毀或減低光度，業經積極整理恢復甚多。關於管理交通，如淸查機動車輛，換領汽車牌照，整理交通標誌，亦均依照計劃，逐一實行。今年改為靠右行駛，事前曾竭力宣傳，並作充分準備。</p>
<p>二、水路方面　除黃浦吳淞兩江由濬浦局負責外，其他有關水利農田及四鄕交通之小河，幾全部淤塞，橋梁·碼頭·海塘，均屬失修，亟待疏浚修理。現此項修理工作，已照初步整理計劃，幾近完成，至疏浚工作，已計劃完竣，準備興工，察勘海塘，亦在擬具計劃中。至交通工具，一爲恢復輪渡數綫，一爲整理黃浦吳淞兩江濟渡，現已核准復航者，已有二十五處，此外船舶登記工作，亦已實行。</p>
<p>戊·轉移社會風氣</p>
<p>本市過去因租界關係，向爲藏垢納汚之所，自經敵偽侵佔，風氣尤爲敗壞，如不力予糾正，前途將不堪設想。糾正之道，可分消極積極二種：</p>
<p>一、消極方面　敵僞目的，原在摧殘我民族之體力與精神，以消滅我國家之自由與獨立，故施行腐化毒化政策，以圖遂其陰謀。乃至全市烟館林立，賭博衆多，娼妓充塞，沉溺其中者不知凡幾。本府接收以後，首須除此三害。除賭博已令嚴密查禁，並獎勵人民密告，以期禁絕外，業經訂定肅淸烟毒總檢查辦法，務期於最短期內，掃除烟毒。娼妓問題較爲複雜，刻正研究取締辦法中。</p>
<p>二、積極方面　爲推行新生活運動起見，業已成立新生活運動促進會，積極展開各項工作。目前主要目的，在養成市民蓬勃奮發之朝氣，而其具體方法之一，　爲推行社會敎育，提倡正當娛樂，以代參烟賭　之　　，而增進市民之身心健康。如整　關放各公園，以供市民之游　，充實恢復圖書館，以供市民閱覽，並成立體育委員會及體育協會，積極倡導各項運動，增關運動塲，將原有賭塲改爲民衆運動塲所，以便利市民之鍛鍊。其他如博物館動物園等亦已派員籌備，短期內當可逐謀恢復。此外則爲成立音樂中心站，籌設美術中心站，及勞作中心站，以捉高民衆音樂藝術之欣賞及創造能力。</p>
<p>己·推展全市敎育</p>
<p>敎育爲立國之本，承先啓後，關係最切。本市經敵僞刦掠敎育蒙受影響，整理推展，甚感繁重。下列數項，特其犖犖大者：</p>
<p>一·接收各級學校　本市市立及私立各中小學校，爲數極衆，敵偽入侵，擅加改制，紊亂不堪。本府接收以後，分別恢復接辦，力加整頓；其應予停辦者，則甄別學生，分發市立各校，對于私立學校，則逐一登記調查及視察。</p>
<p>二·籌設科學實騐所　爲注重科學敎育，補救各私學校理科設備之缺乏，特籌辦科學實騐所。現已設立兩實驗中心站，聘請指導員，排定日程，指定各公私立中學學生，輪流前往實習，俾增加敎學效能。</p>
<p>三·國民敎育　本府成立後，即開始作實施國民敎育之準備工作，擬訂實施計劃，調查全市各區人口分佈情形，次完劃分十六區，儘先改設中心國民學校十六校，特別加以督察指導。</p>
<p>四·掃除文盲　本市文盲甚多，急須推行補習敎育，現一方面分區調查文盲，一方面即從普設民校着手，除於實騐民衆學校設十七班外，另行籌設市立民校二十一所，並飭各市立中小學兼辦民校。</p>
<p>庚·促進市民健康</p>
<p>健康之重要，人所共知，無待煩　，其工作重要者有三：</p>
<p>一·淸　全市垃圾　本府據收　，各區坟圾　　，　計　一一，五一五噸。復　以後，以九晝夜之時間，集中人力工具，全部為之淸除。至於常淸除工作，迄未稍懈，並曾舉行淸潔運動週，以喚起市民之注意與協助。現雖尙未盡合理想，然較諸接收之初，已有顯著進步，仍在繼續努力中。</p>
<p>二，成立市立醫院　本市各醫療機構整理後，經正式成立市立醫院十所，病床九百餘，殊感供不應求，各院均設有免費病床，以務惠貧民。此項免費病床，全市共計四百八十六，占總床之半，將來添設醫院，並擬逐漸增加，以爲推行公醫制度之初階。</p>
<p>三，防治傳染疫病　本市去年九月間，曾發生眞性霍亂，勢甚猖獗，經採取緊急推施，疫　頓見稍挫。種疫工作，亦已施行。此外尙有滅蠅，滅蝨工作，經商請盟軍衛生當局協助，使用DDT特效藥，分往各監獄機塲等地噴射，今尙繼續辦理中。</p>
<p>辛·完成地籍整理</p>
<p>本市在淪陷期間，受敵僞之刧持侵奪，土地經界紊亂，人民產權頓失保障，本府收復之初，即確定以完成地籍之整理爲重要施政方針之一，以期淸理地權，安定民生，茲略述其進行狀况如下：</p>
<p>一，土地測量　計有完成黃浦區之戶地測丈，整理圖籍，添置魚鱗册及處理淸丈積案三項。</p>
<p>二，土地登記　一爲舉辦所有權及移轉登記，先就地籍測量完成之六區開辦，請登記者尙屬踴躍。二爲辦理土地推收，即於未開辦土地登記區域。土地權利有移轉者依法辦理推收，同時依據中央明令，整理契稅。三爲處理永租契土地，除外人持有之永租契土地，依行政院明令，在未規定換發新土地所有權狀辦法前，准予網續保有外，對於吾國人民持有永租契之土地，應一律聲請爲所有權登記。四爲淸理數僞　　所為之士　　利登記，　　所為，一律無茲。　另行　　登記，以保障　人及外商旣得之合法產權。</p>
<p>三，士地估價　在舉辦土地登記各區，分別將其地價分組觀查分定地價廠段，繪製圖表，此項工作正在積極進行中。惟爲控制人民土地登記之申報地價起見，暫就民國三十年估價表，參酌現時情形，予以提高二百倍，以爲暫時審核報價之標準。</p>
<p>壬·推行地方自治</p>
<p>中央業已決定早日實施憲政，而憲政之基礎，在於地方自治，故此項工作，實屬刻不容緩。惟本市爲全國文化經濟中心，人民知識水準，亦爲各地之冠，推行地方自治，自較其他各地爲易，爲達成此項任務起見，本府目前之設施如下：</p>
<p>一，編組保甲　本市辦理保甲係屬創舉，故決採用由上而下方式，即由市而區，由區而保，迨區公所暨保辦公處成立，然後着手辦理各種編保查戶工作，編查完竣，再行依法成立各級民意機構。現區公所業已成立，各區長人選，業已發表，短期內即可開始正式辦公，而編查戶口工作，亦可着手進行。</p>
<p>二，籌設各級民意機構　太市各級民意機構，俟保甲編組完竣後，即可逐步成立。預期本年一月開始辦理公民宣哲及公職候選人檢覆，二月普開保民大會，三月成立區民代表會，四月成立市參議會。並在市參議會未成立前，先行成立市臨時參議會，現已將參候人名單送呈中央核定，一俟發表，即行召開成立會。</p>
<p>此外可附帶述及者即諮議委員會之組織。市政設施允宜，博採周諮，集思廣益，而市參議會以法令所限，名額無多，爲適應需要計，爰組織諮議委員會，其人選不限國籍，庶僑居本市之外籍人士亦得參加，不特對於市政興革必能有所獻　，即對盟國友誼，當亦不無裨益也。</p>
<p>癸·整飭財務行政</p>
<p>整飭財務行政，旨在　淸　汚，剔　中飽，　　　此目的，除查獲貪汚情事，必予嚴辦外，尤須著重良好制度之建立。三閱月來業已實行者，計有三種：</p>
<p>一，勵行公庫制度　公庫制度之優點，即在一般財務管理人員及稅收人員均不直接經手現款，俾防杜其獲有舞弊之機會。其辦法係由市銀行就各稅收機構，分設公庫收款處，派員直接收款，市民納稅，直接交公庫核收。已令飭財政局與上海市銀行簽訂代理市公庫合的，業已實施。此項制度實行後，所有浮收折扣之弊，營私貪汚之風，當可掃除凈盡。</p>
<p>二，商化稽征手續　現有市稅，多局零星，具多由商人代征，納稅人與征收員司，交相勾結，弊竇叢生。簡化精征辦法，係組織稅捐評議會由納稅人將每月營業實情，分別向各該同業公會商會及征收機關申報，先聯合作初步審查，再提交評議會評定其應納稅額，如認有申報不實，始派人員抽查。實施以來，商民稱便，稅收遞增。</p>
<p>三，嚴肅外勤工作　規定外勤人員因公出勤，必須挑有外勸證及外勤單，到達出勤地點，必須先行交閱，否則可由商民扭送警局究辦。又財政局設有密告箱，逐日由局長親自開啓，俾可勤求民隱。施行以還，頗收實效。</p>
<p>以上所舉，僅其大略，此外如辦理工商登記，整理民衆組織，改進水電供應，管理房屋租賃等項，以限於篇幅，不備述焉。</p>
<p>大鈞奉　命來長滬中，臨行之際，主席曾諄諄指示，爲民衆去痛苦，謀幸福。就任之後，百次對僚屬訓話，即提出「以民爲本」一詞，所有市政設施，應以民衆利益爲前提，利民者必竭力以眞之，病民者必竭力以除之。觀於以上所列各項，無一不與市民福利有關，無一不爲市民利益着想，自信尙不負　主席之訓示，與本身之諾言。惟本市收復伊始，困難滋多，一切設施，深感未能滿意，甚盼社會賢達，各界領袖，時規敎言，共同協力，使今後上海市政，能有輝煌成就，斯則大鈞所馨香禱祝者也。</p>
<h3>上海市保衛總團概况</h3>
<p>都市越繁榮，治安則越難確立，本市人口爲四百餘萬，華洋雜處，昔日租界，尤爲罪惡淵藪，自經戰亂，民生凋疲，所謂饑寒起盜心，易使地方治安日趨不寗，當局有鑒於斯，遂於十一月十六日由市保衛委員會組織市保衛總團，茲將該總團概况介紹如下。</p>
<p>工作概况</p>
<p>該總團因員保衛市民，協力軍警，肅滅匪異，確保治安之重要使命，並勵行軍事訓練，完成國民敎育之基礎，遂於三十四年十一月十六日成立。總團長爲容有略將軍，現已着手將所屬各區團大隊之編成，團員團丁之召集，幹部之選用，防務訓練之準備，裝備被服之籌劃等事項，雖僅月餘，然已粗具雛型，至於諸種工作，尙待逐步展開。</p>
<p>編組　該總團隸屬於以市長爲主任委員之保衛委員會，關於軍事上之行動，則受淞滬警備總司令部之指揮，總團部下轄八個區團即：滬東，滬南，滬西，滬北，滬中，浦南，浦北，吳淞等區團，及五個常備大隊，各區團轄三或二個大隊，大隊轄三個中隊，以各該區域內之義務團員爲主幹編成之。平時擔當轄區內之防務，防遏奸匪活動，必要時可不限區域調動，以應情况之變化。常備大隊係以常備團丁編成，配置於必要之地點爲防務上之主要有力部隊，亦義務團員訓練實施之規範。</p>
<p>素質　團員團丁之召集及幹部之選用，力求「質」之優良，不圖「數」之龐大，以期去蕪存　，編成精練之團隊，故一般素質均屬優秀。義務團員除一部份係戰前成績良好之保衛團團員，及萬國商團市華隊隊員外，均係基於自發之精神，志願參加，經甄審合格之善良市民，常備團丁，係經過嚴格考選，學術，思想，體格俱屬優良之壯了，其素質均較勝於普通團隊。</p>
<p>各至級義務幹部係各地區能力幹練，具有服務之熱忱，故類係負有衆望之人士擔任，常備之幹部均爲曾受深湛之軍官敎育，並有抗戰經騐及功績之優秀軍官。</p>
<p>各區團成立後，由於市民責任之自覺，志願參加，備形踴躍，現各區團登記入國之義務團員，已達一萬一千名，常備國丁第一次考取者共五一二名，嗣後預定分期陸續審愼選募，以達編制之定額。</p>
<p>裝備　現在備有之武器，除步槍外，有輕重機槍及各式擲彈筒等，堪供防務及訓練之使用，惟官員服裝，因經費支絀，猶在積極籌劃中，於此希望各界能予協助。</p>
<p>今後計劃</p>
<p>編整　該總團因任務上之必要，預定於短時期內，對各區團義務團隊加以縝密適切之整編，並充實其裝備，使臻於健全，以爲防務之基礎。常備大隊，則以陸續募選之團了，漸次編成規定之部隊數，於一般步兵中隊外，並擬編設重機槍隊，如情形許可，可增編通信部隊，以達成轄區之通信連絡。</p>
<p>防務　該總團因鑒於冬季已臨，易起盜案，故爲達成「保衛」之任務起見，儘先以一部團員實施出防，時間至二月底，共兩個月，每日出防之時間，暫定爲五小時，如有必要，當酌予延長時間及增加出防團員之人數。至擔任出防之部隊區分警戒，巡邏，預備等班，與軍警密切協調，防過匪異。</p>
<p>訓練　訓練之主旨，除使修得達成任務上必要之知能外，着重通德敎育，激勵其堅苦奮勉之精神，養成嚴肅之軍紀及服從心，薰陶其善良之習性，鍛鍊其强靱之體魄，盪滌其因循苟延風氣，使成為健全之「國防人」。</p>
<p>敎育區分為團員（丁）敎育，部隊敎育，幹部敎育，特種敎育等。團員（丁）敎育之期間爲二個月，部隊（中隊以下）四個月，第一期之敎育預定自元旦起至六月底完成之。</p>
<p>團員（丁）及部隊敎育之主要課目如左：</p>
<p>基本職鬥敎練　陣中勤務</p>
<p>夜間敎育　射繫敎育</p>
<p>體據武技　公民常識</p>
<p>保甲常識　防空防毒及時代軍事常識</p>
<p>幹部敎育則依據其職務上之必要，採用美式訓練方法，並參照抗戰經騐選定輪迴實施，以期臻於至善而收事半功倍之効。</p>
<p>法制　該總團擬於短期內編訂該總及所屬團隊之諸種法規，以供目前及將來實施各種工作之遵循，其他關於團員運動，遊藝之組織，讀物之編發，以及諸種設施，亦均在着手計劃中。</p>
<p>容有略少將係廣東中山人，現年四十歲，中央軍校第一期，陸大特別班第三期畢業，曾任營國長，第十軍參謀長，及一九四師師長等職。</p>

<h3>敵產處理與經濟建設</h3>
<p>— 吳承禧</p>
<p>一　第龐大的敵產</p>
<p>八年血戰，老百姓雖然吃盡苦頭，但我們敢於說一句，除了千千萬萬爲國犧牲的寳貴的軍民生命是無可挽回的以外，我們在物質上並沒有吃虧，非但沒有吃虧，而且还獲得了一筆異常龐大的資產—該敵僞那兒所沒收得來的資產。從個人的立塲來說，有的家破，有的廠熾，有的財亡，大家多少都受到一點損失，但從整個國家的立塲來說，八年抗戰決非白白犧牲，而最後勝利的所獲則或者超過國民所遭受到的損害的總和也說不定。</p>
<p>敵產之所以龐大是與牠們那在妄的併吞中國與征服世界的企圖相關聯的，更與中國之長期的抗戰互爲因果。在九一八之後，牠們就積極開發東北，爲的是想把牠作爲侵略中國的根據地；七七事變以後，接着就是八一三的全面抗戰，在武漢退出以後，長期抗戰的局面日益顯著，於是他們便也以百年戰爭來與我們相周旋；在政治上就利用僞組織以遂行其奴化中國的野心，在經濟上則是一面統制，一而開發，一面搜括，澈底的實行以戰養戰，以華制華。在這一政策被執行的過程中，我們的次源被開發了，敵性的工廠在國土內建築起來了，倉庫，碉頭，鐵道，公路，農工業的試騐塲增添出來了，僞幣濫發，而物資却是被高度的集中了，有的更被窖藏起來以備數年之用。他們原是想在中國境內硬幹一輩子的，但不料日美戰爭爆發，他們逐漸的從優勢淪於劣勢，漸漸的本土被人侵入了，海外交通綫一天天被割斷，被封鎖，終至本土與大陸分離，而時隔不久，原子炸彈一擲，日本帝國就完全崩潰了，十幾年來敵人在中國所作的種種開發建設，其成果現在就完全爲我們所佔有了—雖然有不少已經受了相當的損毀，敵人在這幾年來所拼命搜括聚歛的物資終於無法運走而又不得不物歸原主的交還我們了—這就是廠大敵產之所以形成的由來。</p>
<p>這兒我們且看幾個其體的數字。</p>
<p>根據袁慶炎先生在過去兩年所作的研究，日人在華投次的範圍非常之廣，舉凡農，工，礦，金融，貿易與商業，交通與運輸，投次以及其他的雜業等等幾於總有盡有，其中工業一項所包括的計有織維工業，化學工業，五金機器業，建築業，食品工業，木材傢具業，衣着用品業，陶超業以及雜工業等，部門也是很繁多的。若以總公司在中國以及總公司在日本朝鮮與　灣者合計，則日人在華投次的公司，其家數的近四千家（袁君統計凡資本在十萬日圓以下的公司均未計入，吾則還要多）資本額的爲日圓八十萬萬圓。其詳可見下表：</p>
<p>日本在華投資統計（註）</p>
<p>總公司在日本臺灣朝鮮者　總公司在中國者</p>
<p>業別　家數　資本額（千圓）　家數　資本額（千圓）</p>
<p>農業　一　一，〇〇〇　五　四六〇</p>
<p>礦業　八　一，四一四，四八七　一八　七四，八五五</p>
<p>製造工業　一四二　八六九，九三六　七四六　五三三，四〇一</p>
<p>金融業　三四　五九四，〇六〇　四三　二四，〇七〇</p>
<p>貿易與商業　五一五　三，二二九，五二八　二，一〇五　二八五，一三六</p>
<p>交通運輸業　二二　四六二，九〇五　一二五　四〇，四八六</p>
<p>投資業　六　一八六，五七五　一八　三三，八八五</p>
<p>雜業　九　一五八，九〇〇　八九　五一，七四五</p>
<p>總計　七三七　六，九一七，三九三　三，一四九　一，〇四四，〇四〇</p>
<p>（註：本表摘自「經濟周報」一卷一期頁一七—一八）</p>
<p>袁先生上而所作的這一統計並未包括東北的敵產在內。如果加入，則「總計」一定還要龐大得多。關於東北方面的情形，我們現在還沒有確實的數字可考，惟據中國經濟建設協會的總幹事霍實樹先生在兩年前的估計，則日敵在那方而的投資，「的達一百七十萬萬元以上」，此一數字現在是否還能適用，我們不得而知，但從敵人在最近幾年來對於東北開發的積極精神來說，這一數字恐怕只能嫌少而不會多的。（霍先生數字詳見「經濟建設季刋」一卷四期頁十一）</p>
<p>以上是就全國的範疇來說的，現在再看看上海的情形如何？根據某有力方面的調查，截至三十四年九月底爲止，上海日人的產業二千〇三十七家中共有次產値法幣一千九百萬萬元，其詳如下：</p>

<p>從上海區敵偽產業處理局方面，我們也零星的得到一點林料，茲亦一併彙錄於此，以供大家參考：</p>
<p>（一）關於工廠—上海方面敵僞工廠之已被接收者聞已達四百餘家。其中紡織業都份，計有紗錠綫錠一百二三十萬枚。</p>
<p>（二）商店—日人商店之已被接收者已有五六百家，估値甚巨。德商中德孚及拜耳兩商行亦被接收，總値聞在二三百萬萬元以上</p>
<p>（三）物資—聞接收倉庫物資，在上海一埠即達九百餘座，現尚在進行查點中。大部份物資均未出籠運用。此項物資因其種類繁多，數量廠大，將來陸續應市，對物價前途必有良好影響。</p>
<p>（四）房地產—上海已接收者閱已達萬餘幢，現住敵僑尚未接收者尚未計入。</p>
<p>（五）此外如交通工具，機關設備，敎育文化機關，農塲，銀行，金銀錢幣等爲數更爲可觀。</p>
<p>上海一埠的敵產已經這樣可觀了，等平津東北等地的敵產也全部點淸之後，其總數一定大得令人難於置信。然則我們應當怎樣好好的把牠接收過來並予以好好的運用呢？</p>
<p>二　敵產運用與我經濟前途</p>
<p>從過去四個月的經驗來看，敵僞產業的接收工作確實有過一段非常紛亂的時期，接收機關不統一，辦事人員不能公正無私，「接收即是停擺」，倉庫失火，物資喪失損壞，完整的事業體系往往弄得四分五裂，凡此種種，都是勝利太快，政府缺乏準備，用人不當或根本缺乏人才所致。自各區敵僞產業處理相繼成立以後，以上所舉的種種惡劣情形已大爲改善，假以時日，相信敵產之接收整理當可有效的告一段落，今後的問題便是如何運用的問題了。</p>
<p>敵產的沒收在性質上是一種賠款的踝取。歷史上　利者對於戰敗者徵取賠款因而招致戰後之富强者眞是多不勝舉：普法之戰以後的德國，甲午一役之後的日本，便都是近代戰勝者從戰敗者那兒取得大量賠款因而使國內經濟突飛猛進的兩個最顯明的實例。今後的中國又何嘗不可以從龐大的敵產上去打下一部份經濟復興的基礎呢？</p>
<p>關於敵產今後應如何合理有效的加以運用，政府自有全盤政策，無庸我們代謀，且敵產之地域的分佈旣廣，種類又復極繁，具體的如何遝用亦非局外人所能籌劃，因此，我們現在所能談的，只能限於一二關於運用的原則。</p>
<p>大家都知道，中國是一個產業非常落後的國家，因此，今後在運用敵產時所應採用的第一個方針就是要把敵產轉化爲叻長我國工業化迅速開展的有力武器。敵人在我國，尤其是華北和東北所留下來的輕重工業的機構及其他各種設備是　當龐大的，我們應當　這一部份資本妥善完整的使其重復投入生產的行程，從而提高中國的生產力，改善人民的生活水準，加速工業化的進度，促進民族資本之高速度的積累。能夠這樣，相信中國工業化的過程是可以大大縮短的。爲了使得有生產性的敵產能够全部活用，我們以爲政府應當儘量動員所有的民間資本來參與經營，除了與國防有密切關係或民問資本一時無力經營者外，政府應當把所有的敵產以委託經營，官商合辦，出租，出賣等等方式來運用民間的資力和人力以求敵產之最有效的運用和發展。不必要的官辦和無效率的官辦都不足爲訓。</p>
<p>第二，關於從敵僞那兒所沒收得來的物資，我們以爲應該分開兩方而來運用：關於各種原料，凡政府所需用者提供政府，凡爲一般廠商所需要者，平價配與各廠商，凡能提供國外市塲者用以推進國外貿易，總之，不應濫用，但亦不應窖藏不用。關於各糧食糧，以及各種日用製品，我們以爲應當儘速的使其出籠應市，一以謀物資供應之增多，一以謀物價之經常的穩定。上海一埠就有九百座倉庫，價値連城；天津亦有六十萬萬元之物品分存於一百餘倉庫（見十二月十五日大公報）這些物資如果運用得宜，相信對於今後工業生產與人民生活都將是非常有利的。</p>
<p>第三，我們更應運用敵產來平衡財政，减少發行，穩定幣値並减輕民衆的負担。物資的平賣出籠，金銀錢幣的拋出，房地產的變賣，公司商店的處分，不必要的工廠的出租或標賣都可能獲得一筆非常龐大的資金，其數目恐怕要用三個萬字來做單位也說不定。對於這樣大的一筆收入，正是經過入年苦戰而現在又正面對着百廢待舉的財政當局所亟需的，也是今後解決過渡期間赤字財政的重要出路。這些年來，老百姓苦於搜括，苦於通貨膨脹與物價之飛騰者久矣，今後如能在處分敵產上打開出路，使政府不加重捐稅，不乞靈於印刷機，而歲出依然不患無辦法，則國計民生當兩受其惠。實際上，如果敵產處理得當，則政府在本年度中即使不徵一文稅，不發一張鈔票也許也能度過去的，因敵產的實値實在是太大了。</p>
<p>最後，對於敵僞的「偽」字似乎也應當重提一下。這幾年來，幾於無僞不貪，亦可謂凡僞多富，在肅好的過程當中，這批人所搜括的民脂民膏是應當把牠們儘量擠出來的，應當把他們在都市與農村裏所購買的田地房屋，所聚歛的黃金，外幣，所搜集的鑽石，珍玩，古董，字畫，所投資的股票以及所囤積的貨物一古腦兒加以沒收，予以標賣，收入國庫，作爲國用。這些東西共實都是老百姓的血汗，今後政府如能加以善用，則老百姓過去所流的血汗就沒有白廢，只不過在民間是預期繳付，在政府是延期運用而已。</p>
<p>敵產龐大，敵產的作用尤其龐大，願政府愼重處理，妥爲述用，今後民族經濟的復興，一部份宣利賴之。　三四，十二，廿三。</p>
<h3>如何訂定滙率問題</h3>
<p>— 劉大鈞</p>
<p>（本文由第四版轉來）</p>
<p>但戰事已經結束，我們不能採取閉關主義，在此長時間中不准有國際貿易。此點旣做不到，而國際交通工具比國內爲充足，則沿海各都市必先得到大量的舶來品，物價必繼續下跌，而此種物資不易運到後方，後方物價必與沿海各地物價保持頗大的差額。結果是沿海各地物價先與國外物價得到相當的調整，而國內各地物價的調整反要落後。</p>
<p>以上是假設政府繼續維持已往的統制外匯政策，一般輸入商的外匯是由黑市中得來，國外物價與沿海各都市物價的調整是按照黑市匯價計算。根據我們調查所得，雖按照民前黑市美鈔價格計算，有許多物品在國外的物價仍遠較上海爲低。所以一方面上海物價將下跌，一方面因輸入商的爭購外匯而使將來的黑市匯價上升，也就是使黑市匯率下降。至於後方物價，因當地供求關係未能恢復常態，而不免受投機者所操縱，所以同沿海物價不免相差很大。唯其如此，要先調整國內物價，或等候國內經濟安定，再行改訂匯率，調整國際物價，事實上恐不可能。</p>
<p>退一步說，即或此點可以辦到，於我國從前亦屬無益。第一，延綏國際貿易的恢復，使我國不能獲得所亟需的重要物資，於戰後經濟復員自屬有害。國際救濟總署所能供給的物資在類別及用途上有不少限制，而在數量上也不能十分充足，我們決不能倚賴這個機關供給我們一切的正常需要。第二，即我國內各地物價，經過某一個時期，居然獲得一致，而國際貿易一經恢復，全國物價又將發生很大的波動。延緩調整匯率的結果只是延長物價波動的時間，把一件事分做兩截辦而已。</p>
<p>延緩改訂匯率的好處，有人以爲可藉此觀察市塲的匯率的趨勞；如果市塲匯率達到某一水準之時，顯示相常安定，政府就可採用這個匯率，作爲官價。採取這個排法，政府須要開放外匯，准許各外匯銀行和輸出入商自由買賣，方能看出所謂『自然的水準』。但是猛然開放外滙，不免引起滙價與物價雙方很激烈的波動，而我國國際收支一時萬難獲得基本的均衡，滙率也自難達到相當安定的水準。國內物資如此缺乏，國外物價如此低廉（比餃戰前上升程度有限），我國市塲匯率恐不免江河日下，反究引起不良的心理作用。</p>
<p>筆者旣然主張從速改訂匯率，那麽究應採用何種水準泥？最合理的匯率自然是均衡匯率。但上文已說過我國國際收支一時難得基本的均衡，則制定與維持均衡匯率皆屬無望。計算均衡匯率是以購買力平價做參考；在國內物價波動頗大之時，雖不易計算購買力平價，但不妨作一種估計。好在目的旣然不是尋求一個長期的均衡匯率，稍爲偏高或偏低皆無關係。不過匯率與其偏高，不如偏低，因爲偏高的匯率將妨碍輸出而獎勵輸入。我國固然需要外國物資，但過份獎勵輸入，將屬不智。戰後不便嚴格統制輸出入，只能利用適當的匯率，防止非必需物品的輸入，而對於所亟需的，採用津貼或减稅免稅等辦法，使其進口。所謂非必需品不僅指奢侈品而言—奢侈品可以該稅—而應包含若干國內可以生產的日用品。海關對於此種物品，不能征妝重稅，只得藉偏低的匯率予以保護。這與從早恢復國際貿易的主張並無衝突，不過對於物品的種類加以滬擇而已。</p>
<p>日前此間報紙發表楊時進先生一文，以爲在新匯率之下，美元一元應合國幣二千二百元。他計算的根據是：美國躉售物價指數約爲一三五，上海指數約爲九〇〇〇〇，戰前中美匯價是美金一元合國幣三元三角，按照現在雙方物價指數，購買力平價應爲一對二二〇〇。他所引用的上海物價指數是八　份的，是以僞鈔價格計算如以當時市塲僞鈔折合率一對一百三四十折成法幣，一般物價的較戰前高七百倍。以上所用九〇〇〇〇的指數是估計最近上海物價的水準。我們現在已有十月份的上海物價指數，是五八四六六，而且是按法幣計算。牠的基期旣是民國二十五年，那麽這個指數顯示物價只漲了五百八十五倍。如按此指數計算購買力平價，美金一元應合國幣一千四百三十元。</p>
<p>上述指數是金城銀行同德學會所編製，係繼續中國經濟硏究會的工作。所用的雖是商單幾何平均，但從他的分類指數來看，紡織品類，燃料類等皆比總指數爲高，而金屬類高出三倍以上，只有食物一類的指數低於總指數。我們從此可以推測各項物品雖未經加權，而食物一類的項目一定極多，所以無形中將此類加了很重的權數。（楊光生所採用的也是這個指數）</p>
<p>本來計算購買力平價，也有人採用生活費指數爲根據。上海市政府硏究室所編的十一月份勞工生活費指數是一〇二，一九〇，比戰前高一倍以上（是用法幣計軍），而薪給階級的指數是一一一，一〇八，即比戰前高一千一百餘倍。如採用前者，則美金一元應合國幣二千四百九十五元，而採用後者，則應爲二千七百一十六元。生活費指數的榷數是根據多數家庭預算而來，比較前項躉售物價指數似乎稍好，而現在上海物價，根據一般觀察，比戰前實應在一千倍左右。</p>
<p>如此很高的匯價，恐政府因他種關係，未必採用，但我以爲在初改訂時寗可偏高（即是匯率寗可偏低），以後如洋貨進口，國內產量也增加，交通便利，物價下跌，不妨逐漸把匯價壓低。如此可以產生良好的心理作用，使資金不逃往國外，而已在外國的還可『返國』，帮助調整國際收支。</p>
<p>總之，我以爲國內經濟不能自動的達到安定，而需要爲合理的外匯政策加以督促，所以調整匯率宜於從早。一次改訂之後，在我國經濟狀况之下，必不免繼續調整，但以逐漸壓低匯價（即提高匯率）爲宜。至於上海所計算的幾種購買力平價，究應採取何者，甚或完全不用，並無甚大關係。好在此項平價只是一種參考資料，在偏低的原則之下，如何選擇，要看政府政策着重何事了。</p>

<h3>The First New Year After the Victory of the War of Resistance: Chairman Chiang's Proclamation to the Military and Civilians – Although External Threats Have Been Removed, Internal Troubles Remain Severe; Wishing to Fulfill the Legacy and Seek Stability and Revival</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, December 31st] Chairman Chiang and Madame Chiang, on the evening of the eve of the New Year's Day of the 35th year of the Republic of China, at 8 PM, held a grand banquet at the Shandong Linyuan official residence to commemorate the year of the Allies' joint victory and to celebrate Envoy Marshall's sixty-sixth birthday. Present were 151 people, including ambassadors from various countries to China, senior generals from the US military headquarters, members of the Central Executive Committee and Supervisory Committee, standing committee members, members of the National Government Committee, heads of various departments and ministries, and the chairman of the Political Participation Council. During the banquet, Chairman Chiang and Envoy Marshall delivered speeches successively, mutually congratulating the Allied victory and permanent cooperation. The guests and hosts dispersed with delight at 10:30 PM. (Chairman Chiang's speech and Marshall's reply will be broadcast tomorrow.)</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, December 31st] Chairman Chiang's New Year's Day address to the military and civilians of the country in the 35th year of the Republic of China, the original text of which is as follows: Fellow countrymen, military and civilians of the whole nation: Today is the anniversary of the founding of the Republic of China in its thirty-fifth year, and it is our first New Year's Day after the victory of the War of Resistance. In the fourteen years since the September 18th Incident, we have spent this holiday in an environment of darkness and humiliation. In the eight years since the July 7th Incident, we have spent this holiday in a battle of life and death. Now that our War of Resistance has been won, Japan has surrendered, and the national humiliation of many years has been washed away, all the citizens of the Republic of China should be able to raise their heads, stretch their brows, and take a breather to celebrate this New Year's Day. Every one of our compatriots is, of course, exceptionally joyful and exceptionally excited, but the situation of our country is still extremely difficult. Although external threats have been removed, internal troubles are even more serious. The developments of the past few months, it cannot be denied, have left a heavy shadow in the hearts of our compatriots, even after seeing the light of day again. The national status and national glory that we have gained through more than eight years of bloodshed and sacrifice have been diminished at once. And the spirits of the military and civilian martyrs in heaven during the revolution and the War of Resistance cannot be comforted. Speaking of this, regarding the current situation of the country, it is truly a mixture of joy and sorrow. But we can see that the nation will have a bright future after the victory of the War of Resistance, and how to open up this bright future, eliminate the internal worries that exist, and dare to obtain the fruits of true victory, this is our common and unshirkable responsibility.</p>
<p>What is currently occupying my mind is how to fulfill the legacy of our Founding Father and how to realize the demands of the people. The last legacy of our Founding Father was to strive for peace and save China, and to complete the construction of a new China based on the Three Principles of the People. As for the urgent demands of the people today, they can be summed up in one sentence: to seek stability and revival. The demands of the people and the legacy of the Founding Father are consistent. At this time after the war, with devastation everywhere, our compatriots in various places are suffering and awaiting relief, displaced and awaiting return home, unemployed and awaiting re-employment, damaged and awaiting repair, and oppressed and awaiting liberation. But simply put, the premise of all reconstruction work is nothing more than peace and stability. Public sentiment is an absolute necessity for our country and nation, and it is also the greatest key to world peace and security. Therefore, the first urgent task for us is to create a peaceful and secure environment for the entire country. Only when there are no more incidents of unrest and division within the country can there be the possibility of peaceful construction. Only when there are no more factors of disturbance and strife within the country can the foundation of the country be consolidated. Only then can the people live and work in peace. Today, after defeating the invasion and learning from the pain, all political transitional measures may have shortcomings, but the government is actively improving them and will never be perfunctory and delay the opportunity for national revival. But the most important thing is to determine the overall national policy, so that the government and the people have a common track to follow. If the country is in turmoil every day, and the people suffer from fear and anxiety every day, then the post-war peace and construction cannot begin. Therefore, today, at this time of the New Year's renewal, I want to briefly and concisely present the current important national policy, the decisions of our government, and the responsibilities of our people, to make it clear to our compatriots across the country.</p>
<h3>The Goal of the National Revolution: To Build a New China Based on the Three Principles of the People</h3>
<p>Because today is the anniversary of the founding of the Republic of China, I want to first present the purpose and course of our National Revolution to show the path of our future efforts. The greatest goal of our National Revolution is to build a new China based on the Three Principles of the People, and in terms of its course and steps, it can be divided into three periods: The first period was after the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895, from 1895 to 1911. During this eighteen-year period, its goal was to overthrow the Qing Dynasty's imperial system and establish a Republic of China where sovereignty belonged to the people. The second period was from the second year of the Republic of China to the completion of the Northern Expedition in 1928. During this sixteen-year period, its goal was to eliminate the situation of warlord separatism and achieve national unification. The third period was from the twentieth year of the Republic of China to the victory of the War of Resistance last year. During this fourteen-year period, its goal was to defeat the invasion of Japanese imperialism, remove the obstacles to national construction, and complete the construction of a new China based on independence, freedom, and the Three Principles of the People. These three periods have different emphases, but the purpose of the revolution and national construction has been consistent and unchanging. When the Founding Father was alive, he personally led the compatriots across the country in the struggle. After the Founding Father passed away, the members of the Kuomintang have striven to carry on his legacy. During this period, there were many obstacles, and internal and external troubles were intertwined, but they were all destroyed by the great power of the National Revolution. Our Founding Father, from the beginning of advocating revolution in 1894, recognized that without overthrowing the Qing Dynasty's autocracy, there was no way to save China from danger and realize China's democracy.</p>
<p>The Founding Father only knew the responsibility of saving and building the country and never had selfish or self-serving ideas. Therefore, once the Xinhai Revolution succeeded, he yielded power to Yuan Shikai. Yuan Shikai stole the country, and the Republic of China was in danger. The people could not truly express their free will and power, which led to the separation of warlords. Then came the revolution after the second year of the Republic of China. Until the completion of the Northern Expedition, China's unity was finally achieved. However, Japanese imperialists were jealous of our country's unity and, from the beginning, colluded with warlords and created separation, wanting to achieve the goal of destroying China by dividing China. First, there was the September 18th Incident, creating the puppet state of Manchukuo; then, there was the demand for the special status of North China. Our National Government deeply knew that if Japanese imperialists were not driven out one day, the country would not be unified one day, and democratic politics could not proceed. Not only would the survival of our country and nation lose its guarantee, but the entire peace of the world would also be threatened. Our July 7th War of Resistance was to carry out this sacred and great task, and the Second World War also began because of Japanese aggression. From this, it can be seen that if China cannot maintain unity and independence, it will threaten the peace of the world. If we cannot smoothly complete the national construction plan and democratic construction, we cannot build a strong China to stand among the modern countries of the world.</p>
<h3>National Unity and Democracy Are the Focus of Our Future Efforts in National Construction</h3>
<p>Now that Japanese imperialism has been defeated, and the external obstacles that hinder China's unity and obstruct China's democracy have been eliminated. However, the destruction and sacrifices suffered by China, resisting a strong enemy's force for fourteen years with its weak national power, are truly countless. The nation's vitality and the people's livelihood are also hanging by a thread. If we do not seize this opportunity today to actively recover, quickly restore social order, and put national politics on the right track, then the country will have no chance of revival. Today, we truly need to seize the opportunity, consolidate national unity, realize the politics of all the people, and work together for national construction. Therefore, after the victory last year, I earnestly proposed to my compatriots the importance of taking advantage of the recovery work and carrying out construction. I also specifically stated that the focus of future efforts lies in "national unity and political democracy." If our compatriots across the country can carefully understand the needs of our country, they will know where the important national policy lies today.</p>
<p>Fellow countrymen, it has been thirty-five years since the founding of our Republic of China, why have we not been able to complete the national construction plan and the politics of all the people? The only reason is that our country is not unified. And the cause of the Second World War can be traced back to the lack of unity in our China. The purpose of our revolution and War of Resistance was to eliminate the invaders' attempt to divide China in order to destroy China. More than eight years of bloodshed and sacrifice were also to realize national unity in order to protect the survival of the nation. Therefore, in these years, I have earnestly explained to the people the necessity of national unity. I once said that national unity is an absolutely necessary element for modern nation-building, and it must be cherished and protected by the cooperation of all the people in order to have a solid guarantee. Only a unified country can truly obtain the fruits of victory; only a unified country can smoothly promote constitutional administration, guarantee the democratic system, promote public opinion, concentrate the strength of the people, and complete the great plan of national construction; and only a unified country can smoothly promote various economic constructions and improve the living standards of our hard-working compatriots. Moreover, only a unified country can contribute to the peace and well-being of mankind in the new post-war world. And in terms of current facts, we can only jointly maintain national unity in order to smoothly carry out our recovery work. Otherwise, if military orders and political orders cannot be unified, transportation is destroyed section by section, and local order is disturbed everywhere, then the country's recovery work will inevitably be hindered everywhere, and the people's most basic demand for living and working in peace will be impossible to achieve. Therefore, we can be tolerant and yielding in all national affairs, and we can be sincere with each other, but the unification of military orders and political orders, the military must be uniformly under the jurisdiction of the state, and any military actions that separate territory, destroy transportation, and obstruct recovery must be absolutely avoided, which is the only prerequisite for resolving the current disputes and unrest. This is a fact and a truth. Anyone with patriotism and conscience cannot but recognize and fulfill it.</p>
<h3>This Year's Two Major Tasks: Completing the Recovery Plan and Implementing Constitutional Government</h3>
<p>After understanding this important premise, I want to propose to my compatriots the two tasks that our government urgently needs to address this year.</p>
<p>First, we must complete the recovery plan, relieve the suffering of the people, and establish a foundation for construction. Therefore, on the one hand, we must first restore transportation so that people can return home and materials can circulate smoothly, and then economic construction can be developed. On the other hand, we must end military operations, universally disarm the Japanese army, send prisoners back to Japan, effectively reorganize the army, quickly restore local peace and order, and prohibit the exploitation and oppression of the people by local bullies, so that the people can live and work in peace. Only in this way can the people's lives and property be guaranteed, the cause of reviving the country can be carried out, and the military and civilians who suffered, bled, and were disabled in the War of Resistance and the heroic spirits of the martyrs who sacrificed their lives can be comforted.</p>
<p>Second, we must implement a democratic constitutional government as soon as possible, and the constitutional government should belong to the people, creating a government for all the people. Regarding this point, our government has declared it more than once. The ultimate goal of our National Revolution is politics for all the people, and convening the National Assembly and electing politics to the people is the only necessary procedure for national construction. On New Year's Day last year, I declared that the National Assembly could be held in advance without waiting for the end of the war. On March 1st of last year, I officially announced to the Constitutional Implementation Promotion Association that it would be convened on November 12th of last year. Later, because of the opinions of the military council and various parties, the method of convening the National Assembly was agreed upon, but unfortunately, various obstacles were encountered, so that the meeting had to be postponed. Therefore, the National Government issued an order to reschedule the meeting to be convened on May 5th of this year. This major and necessary event cannot be delayed any longer. In order to enable post-war public opinion to be fully expressed, the government is preparing to increase the number of representatives to the National Assembly so that people from all walks of life and various parties can jointly participate in the National Assembly. Now that there are only five months until the date of convening the National Assembly, in order to further promote the stability of the domestic environment, to achieve the sincere unity of the whole country, and to make political cooperation a more substantial and powerful institution, before the National Assembly is convened, if preparations are made to invite social elites and people from various parties to participate in the government, whether it is to participate in decision-making meeting bodies or to participate in administrative bodies that implement policies, the government, based on the principle of public ownership of the world and the ability of the virtuous, will sincerely accept them in order to gather wisdom and benefit widely. And what our government hopes for in this regard is nothing else, only that the various parties participating in the government cannot possess their own independent armies to be used as tools for political struggles. This is because if a country allows armies other than the national army, it is tantamount to creating another country within the country. Then the country cannot be unified under one government. If there are two armies of different natures and orders, then the government must not be healthy, and politics cannot be cooperative, united, healthy, and powerful. To have this is not only to cause the government to belong to different factions at any time, but also to cause the country to be in danger. This is a matter of fact that cannot be avoided, whether it is for the sake of national unity or for the sake of political cooperation. Today, for the sake of the country and for the sake of the people, we must be frank and sincere, with the same heart and mind, to achieve thorough cooperation, not formal cooperation. The most important point is that we must never allow the country to fall into a state of disorder and anarchy, and make the government become an irresponsible government. During the War of Resistance, the fact that China still had independent armies other than the national army was the country's greatest shame and loss. Now that the War of Resistance has been won, there is an urgent need to create a peaceful and stable environment and concentrate the country's strength to begin the work of national construction. Therefore, the government must open up politics as much as possible and realize democracy in advance, and all the country's troops must be under the command of the state and obey the government. This is what truly patriotic people should carefully consider and immediately implement.</p>

<h3>Hoping to Clearly Distinguish Right and Wrong, Advantages and Disadvantages, and Seize This Once-in-a-Millennium Opportunity for Construction</h3>
<p>What has been said above is the direction of our government's efforts this year. We believe that the suffering of the people after the war cannot be allowed to deepen any further. The foundation of the country must not be shaken in the slightest. The fruits of victory must not be destroyed in the slightest. The work of recovery and construction must not be delayed any further. Therefore, we will not show any tolerance in maintaining domestic peace; we will spare no effort in restoring social order; we will not avoid any obstacles or difficulties in promoting the implementation of a democratic constitutional government as scheduled; and we will use all possible peaceful means to resolve any domestic disputes. Except for the revolutionary responsibility that cannot be abandoned, the unity of the country that cannot be harmed, the fundamental law that cannot be changed, and the foundation of the government that cannot be shaken, everything else can be tolerated and everything can be negotiated. I sincerely hope that all our compatriots will recognize right and wrong, clearly distinguish advantages and disadvantages, deeply remember the suffering and humiliation of China's national weakness and decline over the past century, be aware that the once-in-a-millennium opportunity for national revival and construction cannot be obtained again, observe based on facts, understand the beginning and the end, and will not be incited by rumors to shake their confidence in the future of the country and abandon their duty to the nation. I earnestly hope that all our compatriots across the country, on the one hand, must do their best, be responsible and dutiful, and stand up bravely to promote the success of recovery, democracy, and the construction of the Three Principles of the People; at the same time, they must support the government in implementing democratic and unified policies, supervise all the government's military and political measures, report corrupt and illegal officials, clear away accumulated malpractices, and cleanse corruption, so that the country can truly embark on the track of peaceful construction.</p>
<p>Chiang Kai-shek followed the Founding Father and devoted himself to the revolution, aiming to save the country and restrain the powerful. Internally, he maintained national unity; externally, he sought world peace. He contributed his life to the country, and success or failure, life or death, had long been put aside. Now that the War of Resistance has been won and his long-cherished wish has been fulfilled, personal gains and losses are even less of a concern. Today, I personally have nothing else to ask for, I only hope that all compatriots across the country will recognize the hardship of the country's future, realize the importance of their responsibility, and everyone will work together with the spirit of "yesterday's death, today's life; yesterday's wrong, today's right" to be responsible, so that the achievements of the National Revolution for more than fifty years can be inherited, and the hard struggle and sacrifice of the military and civilians for fourteen years will not be wasted. This May, the National Assembly will be convened to implement constitutional government, so as to achieve our wish to elect politics to the people and realize politics for all the people. The great responsibility of the country's prosperity and decline, as well as the world's safety and well-being, will soon be entrusted to all our citizens. I deeply hope that all my beloved compatriots will take timely action and actively prepare to shoulder this sacred and arduous responsibility. In the future, will we complete the great cause of the National Revolution and realize the construction of the Three Principles of the People? Or will we allow the achievements of the revolution and the War of Resistance to fall short? Can we ensure that the country does not repeat the mistakes of the early Republic of China and fall into a state of disintegration and collapse? Can we truly build China into an independent, free, and democratic country based on the Three Principles of the People? Or are we willing to bear the shame of a semi-colonial country for a century? Can we truly achieve national liberation? Or will we still be inevitable to suffer from crises and sufferings again? Should China become a major factor supporting world peace? Or should we allow China to become an outcast in the international community? This heavy burden will fall on the shoulders of all compatriots across the country. The prosperity and decline of China, the safety and well-being of our descendants, after the implementation of constitutional government, will not only be borne by the National Government of China, but will be decided by all compatriots as the true masters of the country. It is not long until May, so I want to take this opportunity to earnestly exhort, to make our government's desire to return power to the people, as well as the Founding Father's wish to realize the Three Principles of the People and complete politics for all the people, can create lasting happiness for the future of the country. This is what all our compatriots should strive for in a timely manner.</p>
<h3>We Must Cheer Together to Welcome Victory and Implement Politics for All the People</h3>
<p>Fellow countrymen! After this War of Resistance, the country's vitality has been depleted, and the work of national construction has been delayed. We must look around at today's world, a world that is advancing by leaps and bounds, an era that is making rapid progress. China is lagging behind in everything, and if we want to stand among the modern countries of the world, we need to make efforts to catch up. Looking back on the history of the past century, the country was in a semi-colonial position, and the people were living inhuman lives as slaves. After the defeat in the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895 and the Boxer Rebellion, the country almost fell into a state of eternal doom. Fortunately, our Founding Father rose up and led the revolution, and the compatriots across the country followed him and worked together. By the victory of this War of Resistance, the country was able to gain an independent and equal status because of the abolition of unequal treaties, and the nation also gained liberation and freedom. And our allies are also sincerely assisting in the revival of our country. This opportunity is truly unprecedented. This opportunity for revival and construction can be said to be once in a millennium, and it will be fleeting. We must not delay any longer and make mistakes. We have many things to be done, and we rely on our compatriots to be especially frugal, hardworking, and striving. Everyone should be polite, know shame, be responsible in everything, and abide by discipline. Only then can our economic construction and other national construction work proceed as planned. Only then can all the plans for the revival of our recovered areas be implemented smoothly. Since the War of Resistance, how many military and civilian martyrs have sacrificed their lives for the war. They have not had the chance to personally witness the victory, but we are able to witness the washing away of national humiliation for fifty years and the revival of the country. This is truly the greatest happiness in life. Fellow countrymen: Today, with a passionate heart, I congratulate you on your happiness! At the same time, I want to use the proverbs of "seek more blessings for yourself" and "self-help and others help" as my personal New Year's gifts to you. I deeply hope that you will inherit this incomparably arduous task of post-war construction with an excited and positive spirit. Fellow countrymen: We must cheer together to welcome the victory of the War of Resistance, complete the work of recovery and construction, consolidate national unity, implement politics for all the people, long live the Three Principles of the People! Long live the Republic of China! (End)</p>
<h3>Chairman Decides to Convene Political Consultative Conference on the 10th of This Month; Government Yesterday Proposed a Ceasefire Plan</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Telegram, Chongqing, 31st] It is learned that Chairman Chiang of the National Government has decided to convene the Political Consultative Conference on January 10th, with the conference scheduled from the 10th to the 23rd. Furthermore, at 6 PM on the 31st, Chang [unclear character], Wang Shijie, Shao Lizi [unclear character], Zhou Enlai, [unclear character] Biwu, Ye Jianying, and Gan Ruofei continued their discussions. The government representatives formally presented the following practical plan for cessation of conflict: Ceasing domestic military conflict has always been a hope of the government. To achieve this goal, both sides must have a practical agreement on methods; otherwise, an agreement to cease conflict will be difficult to effectively implement. To this end, the following is proposed: (1) Cease all military conflicts in all parts of the country and restore railway transportation. (2) Because domestic military conflicts and transportation obstructions are related to our country's obligations to the Allied nations regarding surrender acceptance and repatriation [of prisoners], all matters related to the cessation of military conflict, restoration of railway transportation, and other matters related to surrender acceptance will be addressed by one representative from the government, one representative from the CCP, and General Marshall jointly discussing methods and submitting them to the government for implementation. (3) The Presidium of the National Political Consultative Council will nominate five impartial individuals to form a military investigation team. This team will go to conflict zones nationwide to investigate military affairs, traffic conditions, and other matters related to domestic peace restoration. They will submit reports and publish the true facts at any time. When the Political Consultative Conference is established, they will also be asked to nominate impartial individuals to participate.</p>
<p>[Reuters Telegram, Chongqing, 31st] During negotiations with Zhou Enlai, the government stated that the Kuomintang is giving Chiang Kai-shek’s consideration to the three-point proposal for unconditional comprehensive cessation of hostilities put forth by the Communist Party. The Communist Party also pointed out yesterday that Chiang Kai-shek previously reached an agreement with Mao Zedong that included a provision that "resolute measures should be taken to avoid internal [conflict]."</p>

<h3>Soviet Troops to Withdraw from Northeastern Provinces Before February 1st; Confirmed by Byrnes' Speech</h3>
<p>[Associated Press Telegram, Washington, 31st] U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes stated in a radio address today that the claim that the Soviet Union is preparing to withdraw its troops from the northeastern provinces before February 1st has been confirmed at the Moscow Conference of Foreign Ministers. Byrnes said that the Moscow Conference reaffirmed the policy of non-interference in China and that the plan decided upon by the conference would serve as "valuable support for U.S. Special Envoy to China, General Marshall." In addition, Byrnes defended the agreement of the Three-Power Conference to control Japan.</p>
<p>U.S. Secretary of State Broadcasts</p>
<p>[United Press Telegram, Washington, 31st] U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes gave a radio address to the American people last night, reporting on the situation of the Moscow Conference, saying that the various agreements and understandings established at the Moscow Conference fully considered China's interests. China participates in the Five-Power Conference of Foreign Ministers, the Far Eastern Commission, the Four-Power Control Commission for Japan, the Korean Provisional Government organization, and trusteeship. However, if China is divided internally, it will not be able to occupy an appropriate position in the United Nations to legally fulfill its international responsibilities. President Truman's recent announcement of China policy was also discussed at the Moscow Conference. The United Nations agrees on this policy. The three governments all acknowledge that China should end its internal conflicts and that all parties should expand their participation in the National Government, and reiterate their adherence to the policy of non-interference in China's internal affairs. Molotov discussed the issue of U.S. and Soviet troops in China with me. In accordance with the Sino-Soviet Treaty, the Soviet Union plans to withdraw its troops from the nine eastern provinces before February 1st. U.S. troops in North China will either disarm Japanese troops and repatriate them, or withdraw when China can complete this task itself without U.S. assistance. The Three-Power reaching an understanding on China policy can also help General Marshall fulfill his mission.</p>
<p>On the Korean Issue</p>
<p>Cooperation with the Provisional Government</p>
<p>Or Trusteeship May Not Be Necessary</p>
<p>Regarding the Korean issue, Byrnes said that the U.S.-Soviet Joint Commission, in cooperation with the Korean Provisional Democratic Government, may find that trusteeship is not necessary. Our goal is to expedite the date when Korea becomes an independent member of the United Nations. The Korean management government has tried to solve this problem. The Joint Commission will recommend to the U.S., Britain, Soviet Union, and China to establish a Korean Provisional Democratic Government and will make suggestions to those governments regarding the preparation of Korea for independence within five years under four-power trusteeship.</p>
<p>Signing of Peace Treaties</p>
<p>Soviet Union Has Made Concessions to the U.S.</p>
<p>All Participants Are Eligible to Attend</p>
<p>Byrnes also revealed that one of the obstacles to the London Five-Power Conference of Foreign Ministers was the Soviet Union's insistence that peace treaties be drafted only by the major countries that signed the armistice treaty, while other representatives said that all countries that actively participated in the war should be allowed to participate in the peace conference. No agreement was reached on this matter in London, so many considered the London Conference a complete failure. However, the Moscow agreement has accommodated the position insisted upon by the United States, that all those who participated in the war are eligible to participate in the peace conference, and it has been clearly recognized that major countries are responsible for the formation of the peace treaty. This agreement stipulates that the initial drafting of peace terms will be done by the major countries that signed the armistice treaty, but immediately after the draft is completed, it should be submitted to a peace conference convened by the five countries of the U.S., Britain, Soviet Union, France, and China. These five countries form the Council of Foreign Ministers and are permanent members of the United Nations Security Council. All countries that actively participated in the war will be invited to attend the peace conference, which should be convened before May 1 of next year.</p>
<p>U.S. Far East Policy</p>
<p>Creating Conditions for Peace</p>
<p>Cooperate with Allies</p>
<p>Creating conditions that can maintain lasting peace in US policy in the Far East, and cooperating with allies, is an essential part of this policy. Although the United States shouldered difficult responsibilities in defeating Japan, it often regarded the war against Japan as part of the war against the Axis powers. Therefore, from the beginning, it intended to make the control of Japan a joint responsibility of the United Nations. As early as August 20 of this year, it invited the three countries of China, Britain, and the Soviet Union to jointly implement the Potsdam Declaration and the terms of Japan's surrender. Although the Far Eastern Advisory Commission was established in October, the British retained its advisory nature, and the Soviet Union requested that the Tokyo control mechanism be decided before participating in the work of the commission. The governments of the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union, with the consent of China, recognized the establishment of the Far Eastern Commission at the Moscow Conference. The commission will be composed of representatives from China, the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, France, the Netherlands, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, India, and the Philippines. Byrnes forcefully stated that the establishment of the Far Eastern Commission and the Control Commission for Japan does not bind MacArthur's administrative policies. The United States remains the primary leader in the formation of policy. The Far Eastern Commission has the power to formulate principles for the control of Japan. Its decisions can be included in the directives of the U.S. Supreme Commander. Although the policy toward Japan must be agreed upon by the three powers, its basic policy cannot be implemented without the consent of the United States. Before the United States concludes any agreement on the establishment of the Far Eastern Commission, it can freely issue temporary directives to deal with all emergencies. It is expected that the United States will use this temporary authority to deal with only the following three issues: (1) changes in the methods of controlling Japan stipulated in the terms of surrender, (2) the fundamental policies of the Japanese constitutional structure, and (3) changes to the entire Japanese government.</p>
<p>The Atomic Bomb Issue</p>
<p>Technical Aspects Not Discussed</p>
<p>The Soviet Government Did Not Inquire</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of atomic energy, according to Byrnes, the discussion of the three foreign ministers on atomic energy was limited to the British and American proposal to establish a management committee by the United Nations. As for technical or scientific matters, there was no time to discuss them. The Soviet government did not inquire about this new weapon. Byrnes said that with regard to the agreement to convene a 21-nation peace conference before May 1, 1946, the United States insisted that all countries that actively participated in the war should participate in the peace conference. Regarding an agreement on the expansion of the governments of Romania and Bulgaria to obtain British and American recognition, Byrnes did not fully express his satisfaction but hoped that the governments of the two countries would substantially improve their "democratic nature". Byrnes was also not disappointed that no agreement was reached on the Iranian issue.</p>

<p>Bengbu</p>
<p>Bandits Attacked Xuqiao, Repelled</p>
<p>The 9th District Security Regiment was ordered to concentrate in Xuqiao for inspection. On December 27th, Deputy Commander Wang (Yuancai) of the Special Security Commissioner's Office, along with Chief of Staff Yang (Ziqin) and Regiment Commander Cheng Shouzhi, led the troops and arrived at the location at 10:00 AM on that morning. Because the inspection procedures were not completed, they stayed in Xuqiao that night. Unexpectedly, more than a thousand bandits (17th and 18th regiment) carrying light machine guns, mortars, and grenades, took advantage of the security regiment's inspection troops to attack Xuqiao at about 10:00 PM that night. Fortunately, Deputy Commander Wang and others divided the soldiers and fought several times against the bandits. After a fierce battle lasting four hours, the bandits were finally defeated, and more than 30 bandits, including the company commander, were killed, and more than 20 were injured. Three Han-made rifles and more than 100 grenades were seized. The bandits were unable to withstand the attack and fled to the deep mountains near Dingning'an.

<h3>Published Correspondence</h3>
<p>To the Editor:</p>
<p>Regarding your newspaper's local dispatches on December 26th stating: "The Songjiang County government has received orders to purchase 50,000 shi of military grain, priced at 5,000 yuan per shi, but has only received 35 million yuan. It is difficult to complete the order. Furthermore, due to severe financial constraints in the county treasury, borrowing is impossible. After discussion among various government agencies, legal entities, and local gentry, it was decided to temporarily issue military grain exchange vouchers to serve as proof of purchase, not to be circulated in the market. It is stated that upon receipt of funds from the provincial government, a public announcement will be made to invalidate the vouchers," etc.</p>
<p>We have verified that the funds are disbursed in installments. The county believes it is essential to purchase the grain in a timely manner and must place the order all at once. To meet the deadline, they are forced to exhaust all resources. The method of issuing temporary military grain exchange vouchers was not submitted to the province for approval beforehand, and the procedure is indeed not in compliance. However, it is claimed that these vouchers, although not circulating in the market, have been ordered by this office to be collected and destroyed by the county.</p>
<p>Furthermore, your newspaper continued to report on the county's grain purchase situation on December 27th, stating: "It is heard that Zhu Ziyu, the chairman of the Rice Industry Association, has avoided going elsewhere, leading to the surveillance of the actions of Director Wu Zijing, etc." According to a telegram from the county to this office, Zhu Ziyu, the chairman of the Rice Industry Association, absconded with a large sum of 14 million yuan for grain purchase. This differs from the newspaper report. In addition to a thorough investigation, we are sending this letter to your newspaper to clarify the facts of the matter and request that you publish it.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

<h3>Chiang Ching-kuo in Moscow: To Return to Original Post in Northeast After Mission is Completed</h3>

<h3>General MacArthur's New Year's Message to the People of Japan and the Philippines: The Japanese People Have Been Liberated and Should Act Accordingly in the Future; Encouraging the Filipinos to Unite Closely and Strive for Post-War Reconstruction</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, December 31st] General MacArthur issued a New Year's message to the Japanese people today, stating: "The future of Japan will no longer be decided by a minority. Militarism, feudalistic thinking, and all other physical and mental restraints have been completely eliminated. Freedom of thought and militarized education have been liberated. The Japanese people can now enjoy freedom of religion and freedom of speech without unreasonable interference. Freedom of assembly has also been guaranteed. All measures to enslave the people have been removed, and the Japanese people have now obtained full freedom. However, after gaining freedom, the Japanese people must create their own thoughts and actions and must not blindly follow others. This is the responsibility of the Japanese people. The Japanese people must realize that they now have the ability to govern themselves, and they must do everything that should be done themselves. I hope that this New Year's Day can be the beginning of 'the right path, truth, and light' for the Japanese people."</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Tokyo, December 31st] General MacArthur recently issued a New Year's message to the people of the Philippines, saying: "I will never forget your determination and unity in achieving victory. You are currently in urgent need of establishing a new country and becoming a member of the United Nations. The completion of this great task depends on the full application of your faith and strength."</p>
<p>Multiple-Nation Control of Japan Will Only Create More Chaos</p>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, December 31st] Well-informed sources here announced today: General MacArthur is most dissatisfied with the establishment of a four-nation committee regarding the new method of controlling Japan, because it has already taken great pains to force the Japanese to implement the provisions of the Potsdam Declaration. The establishment of the four-nation committee will only create more chaos. General MacArthur's special statement last night that he "disagreed" refers to this. This dispute arose in early October when the Soviet Union requested the organization of a four-nation committee to jointly control Japan. General MacArthur's aides told United Press reporters that "such a committee would only cause disputes." The Japanese government organization and the thinking of the Japanese people are deeply ingrained. It is already difficult to make them obey and force them to make thorough reforms under the command of one person. If the government comes from multiple sources, it will disrupt the process. The cunning Japanese will definitely seize the opportunity to be opportunistic. Since the first landing of American troops in Japan, only General MacArthur has issued orders to the Japanese Emperor and his cabinet. As for General MacArthur acting on the instructions of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in Washington, the Japanese do not care. They only know that the supreme power in Tokyo is General MacArthur's headquarters. Once they see that General MacArthur's power has been reduced, it will "lose face" for General MacArthur in a country that values face, which will not help the situation. The new plan decided by Moscow has caused disturbance among the Japanese. The implementation of the various instructions issued by General MacArthur will inevitably be slackened.</p>
<h3>General MacArthur's Government to Reform Educational Curriculum Today</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Tokyo, December 31st] General MacArthur recently ordered the reform of the Japanese educational curriculum. From New Year's Day 1946, all history, geography, ethics, and other subjects that shaped Japanese students into extreme nationalist military figures should be stopped. General MacArthur ordered the Japanese Ministry of Education to recompile the curriculum to replace these subjects. The newly compiled curriculum should focus on the basic truths of the social economy and politics of the world and the students' lives. The classroom open debate system should be implemented as much as possible. At the same time, the Ministry of Education should submit the compilation plan for the school textbooks for the coming spring to General MacArthur for review.</p>
<h3>Japanese People Allowed to Display Rising Sun Flag on New Year's Day</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, December 31st] According to Japanese sources, Japan has been allowed by General MacArthur's headquarters to display the Rising Sun Flag on New Year's Day and on January 3rd and 5th.</p>
<h3>Deputy Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies to Return to Java with Concrete Proposals</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, December 29th] Van Mook, the Deputy Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies, has decided to return to Java on January 5th to resolve the East Indies crisis. He will grant the Indonesian leaders a transformed autonomy, but not a purely independent government. Van Mook first consulted with the Dutch government in The Hague last week, and then held talks with the British Prime Minister in London, which ended yesterday. He will soon return to Java to reopen the trial with the Indonesian leaders and interject concrete proposals.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Batavia, December 31st] The Indonesian cabinet held a meeting yesterday, which is expected to discuss the smooth takeover of the entire area of Batavia by the British army.

<h3>Strong Protest from Korea Against Five-Year Trusteeship; Telegram Sent to United Nations Agencies</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Chongqing, December 31st] Members of the Korean Provisional Government's delegation to Chongqing announced today: They have lodged a strong protest with the United Nations agencies against the trusteeship system established by the Moscow Three-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference.</p>
<p>Martial Law in Southern Korea</p>
<p>[United Press, Seoul, Korea, December 30th] After some Koreans claimed that they had been "sold out by the Allies," Lieutenant General Hodge, commander of the US military in southern Korea, issued a curfew order to all Americans in Korea today, prohibiting passage after 8 pm every night. Although Korean leaders have called on the public to take a passive stance to deal with the trusteeship proposed by the Moscow Three-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference, some nationalist elements have expressed that they will resist the occupying troops. There is now a possibility of a general strike in the transportation and business sectors. Lieutenant General Hodge invited Korean political leaders to discuss ways to clarify the situation, but the more important leaders ignored it.</p>
<h3>Dante's Remains Reburied in Roman Tomb</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] According to a San Francisco broadcast on December 31st: Italian newspapers reported that the remains of the great artist Dante have been reburied in a Roman tomb. During the war, these remains were placed in an armored coffin to prevent bombing.</p>
<h3>Looking Forward to Japan in Turmoil and Confusion: Transitioning from a Modified Feudal System to a Democratic Category</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, December 31st] In turmoil and confusion, the ideal new Japan will be realized next year; however, the Japanese people are still at a loss as to what they should do. Countries around the world hope that Japan will reform quickly and achieve results early, but expectations are too high, and the results may not be satisfactory. However, after being busy, hesitant, and making several mistakes, they can gradually progress and transition from a modified feudal system to a democratic category. The blueprint has now been handed over to the Japanese leaders. This measure will be completed in a dramatic setting. The following are some of the most important aspects, such as the trial of major war criminals, which will begin in mid-February, the food shortage will become increasingly severe, inflation and the increase in crime (which will reach its peak in mid-April), and the control of the United Nations. Japan is not a democratic country, and it is not even ready to become a democratic country at present, but compared with Japan a few months ago, it has changed a lot. There have been some important basic changes, but the reform work is still in its early stages. A few months ago, when the Allied forces were approaching, the Japanese people waited anxiously for the Emperor to broadcast an order to fight the Allied forces to the death. The arrogant leaders intensified their control at home and exaggerated the vast empire occupied by the Japanese army, without revealing that the empire had been shattered. Propagandists continued to smear the savagery of Westerners in the newspapers. When they were exhausted and surrendered, the truth was revealed, and the country was filled with resentment, just like people who were walking near a cliff, startled and retreated. The war maniacs, once their dreams were shattered, were all silent, and the people openly rebuked the leaders they had followed for a long time and turned to the victorious Allied forces. Therefore, after the American troops entered and occupied the country, they did not encounter guerrilla duties, but were praised as liberators. The Japanese also found it easy to get along with the Americans, and the Americans brought comfort and peace. Eight years of darkness and suffering made them eager to laugh and forget the past. Therefore, the friendship between the Americans and Japanese became more and more widespread. Moreover, the Japanese public sentiment has fundamentally changed. Although they still vehemently opposed the Emperor's abdication, General MacArthur recently ordered the abolition of Shinto as the state religion, which directly infringed on the position of the imperial family, but the people did not say anything. If this had been proposed a few weeks ago, it would have caused the Japanese people to resist silently. Now, even the position of the Emperor has become a political issue for public discussion, and it is no longer a violation of the law. According to Jiji News Agency, Japanese public opinion on the Emperor's issue can be divided into three categories: (1) Unconditional support for the Emperor system; (2) Advocate for constitutional monarchy, the Emperor continues to be in office, but his privileges are reduced; (3) Support the abolition of Japan and the establishment of a republic. In fact, among the many political parties that have emerged in Japan after the war, except for the Communist Party, all advocate for the retention of the Emperor. Only the Communist Party advocates for the abolition of the monarchy. Many public tests have been conducted on this issue. Most of them are either lacking in system, or the subjects are unimportant parts of the public. However, the results of the tests all show conflicting opinions, and coexist. The Social Research Society of Tokyo Imperial University tested 131 students of the Imperial University. The results showed that 40% supported retaining the Emperor with partial changes, 35% supported retaining the Emperor with fundamental reforms, 12% said that the Emperor should not be discussed, 6% advocated complete abolition, and the rest did not express their opinions.</p>
<h3>Nehru Predicts Future War: Eastern National Movements Are Surging, and Cannot Be Suppressed by Atomic Bombs</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Raipur, December 31st] Nehru, one of the leaders of the Indian National Congress, presided over the All India States People's Conference (an organization of people in the Indian chieftain-ruled states supporting the policies of the Congress Party) here today and predicted that millions of people in Asia would rise up to resist, leading to a third world war. Mr. Nehru mentioned Southeast Asia and Indonesia, saying: Britain is now engaged in a battle that will surely fail, and its source of strength is gradually drying up. This is becoming increasingly clear. Judging from recent developments, the United States has allowed this action, which has very serious consequences for all parties concerned. Because the countries of Asia do not want to be ruled by any empire and will rise up to resist, and it is the continuous resistance of millions of people, whose enthusiasm cannot be suppressed even by atomic bombs. This resistance will lead to a terrible third world war. The British intervention in the war in Indonesia is very similar to the intervention of Germany and Italy in the war in Spain, and the Spanish war was the prelude to the Second World War. We are deeply resentful and ashamed that Indian troops are being used to engage in Britain's dirty work and to fight against our friends. Mr. Nehru concluded by saying: India will have great developments in the future. The chiefdoms have served as the British "fifth column" in India for 150 years. Now they should understand that great changes are bound to come, and the chieftains cannot rely on foreign protection for long.</p>
<h3>Strengthening Revolutionary Forces: Vietnamese Parties Unite; All Issues to Be Resolved by the National Assembly</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hanoi, December 27th] (Delayed) The Vietnam Independence League, the Vietnam Revolutionary League, and the Vietnam Nationalist Party had frictions from time to time due to different political views. In recent months, the leaders of the three parties have repeatedly consulted on ways to unite and strengthen revolutionary forces. After the meeting, they jointly signed and issued a statement of unity and agreed to resolve all issues by the National Assembly elected on January 6th. The provisional government reorganized on January 1st will be a joint provisional government, in which all parties participate. A new Vietnamese government will be organized after the National Assembly.</p>
<h3>United Nations General Assembly: Arranging Matters for the Opening of the Meeting; Six-Nation Group to Go to the United States</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, December 31st] The Six-Nation Committee will leave here on Thursday for the United States. There is one Chinese representative. The purpose of the committee's trip to the United States is to select a permanent site for the United Nations organization. The successful conclusion of the Moscow Three-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference has given the United Nations conference, which will begin next year, more hope for success. The arrangements for the United Nations General Assembly and the dispatch of 2,000 representatives to the meeting are about to be completed.</p>
<h3>Heart Transplant Experiment Successful</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, December 31st] Moscow Radio broadcast today that Soviet young biologist Shenixin had previously experimented with heart transplantation on frogs and other animals and achieved success. Now he has transplanted two hearts into a bird and achieved satisfactory results. According to Shenixin, "There are now warm-blooded animals with two hearts in my laboratory, and they are in good condition. In the initial experiment, I placed the second heart under the neck skin. Although the transplant was successful, the bird could not survive for long due to temperature. Now I have found a safer place to transplant the second heart, that is, to remove a lung and replace it with a heart, which can share the labor of the main heart." The radio also said that if patients with heart failure transplant a second heart, they can avoid blood stoppage and save the patient's life.</p>
<h3>Second Part of Hitler's Will Published</h3>
<p>[United Press, Nuremberg, December 30th] The second part of Hitler's will was published today by the United Nations authorities, proving that Goering and Himmler were dismissed by Hitler during the war because they negotiated with the enemy. The will stated, "Goering and Himmler colluded with the enemy and conspired to usurp the country, not only failing to be loyal to me, but also humiliating the country and the nation." At the same time, British and German intelligence officers also announced that an annex to Hitler's will was found in Hanford, drafted by the late Propaganda Minister Goebbels, dated April 29, 1941, at 5:30 am, half an hour after Hitler's will was drafted, signed only "Dr. Goebbels." In the annex, Goebbels decided to respect Hitler's order to leave Berlin and assume the position of Prime Minister of the new government. Hitler believed that the new government could fight to the end. He also said, "At this critical time, the leader is surrounded by rebels, so at least a part of the people should be loyal to the leader to the end." In the first part of his will, Hitler announced that all his possessions, regardless of value, would be given to the Nazi Party. If the Party no longer exists, they will be given to the country. If the country is destroyed again, then I have no need to order anything else. The paintings I have collected are not for my own sake, but to establish an art gallery in my hometown of Linz on the Danube River for the enjoyment of fellow enthusiasts.</p>
<h3>Nazi Stormtrooper Officer Hofmeng Executed by Hanging</h3>

<h3>After the Moscow Conference: The Trend of World Politics: The United States Concedes on the Issue of Controlling Japan to Win Soviet Endorsement of its China Policy</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, December 31st] The Washington correspondent of the London Observer said: Secretary of State Vinar wants to win the favor of the Senate, but the Soviet Union's participation in the control of Japan is often a major obstacle for him to show his power. This is a part that cannot be fully understood in the agreement. Although the daily administration of the control of Japan is not hindered, the Soviet Union has the right to veto the reconstruction work of Japan. However, there have been many changes, and these must be reviewed. The United States can use its veto power here. Stalin's permission this time to end the current situation in Korea and reiterate his endorsement of China's policy are due to the concessions he obtained on the control of Japan. There is no connection between the US and Soviet occupied areas of Korea. What is known to the outside world is only reports about confiscation and chaos. As for China, there is no problem with the withdrawal of the Soviet troops from the Northeast. The Soviet Union is not very interested in Yan'an. The issue of unifying China will be handled by the US special envoy to China, General Marshall. It is surprising that the Moscow Communiqué did not mention the issue of Iran and Tatar Niel. Turkey has not won much sympathy due to its attitude during the war. Most of the Soviet Union's nerve war against Turkey is also due to this. Although the Soviet Union's actions are not in line with the times, there are not many comments. As for the Iranian issue, it is different. The Tehran Agreement is in danger. It is said that the best way to solve the Iran-Soviet issue is to promote the cooperation of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union to develop the oil fields in Iran.</p>
<h3>Concern for the Situation in Iran: Britain Can Hardly Act Alone</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 31st] London diplomatic correspondents report: London is paying close attention to the situation in Turkey and Iran. When Foreign Secretary Bevin departed for Moscow, it was deeply hoped that Iranian officials would have the right to attend, but in the end, the Iranian Prime Minister and Foreign Minister did not obtain the convenience of traveling to the Soviet capital. Now, almost all American troops have withdrawn from Iran, and the Soviet Union's intentions in Iran are unclear, so Britain finds itself in a position where it can hardly act alone in Iran. As for Turkey, the psychological warfare against Turkey has neither weakened the Turkish government's control nor has it seen the emergence of autonomous movements in Kars and Ardahan. On the contrary, the Turkish people are becoming more united to support the government. The Soviet Union may not forcibly seize the requested land. However, if the Soviet Union continues to make indirect demands, and Turkey refuses to yield, the future development is difficult to predict.</p>

<h3>Promote a Unified and Democratic China Through Peaceful Means</h3>
<p>Today is the New Year's Day of the 35th year of the Republic of China, and also the first New Year after the people of the whole country bravely resisted for eight years and achieved final victory. The people of the whole country, after much pain and reflection, should, amidst the singing and dancing of this New Year, accurately recognize the great responsibilities that the post-war world has given to China, as well as the ways in which China should shoulder great responsibilities, and then exert strength so that our Chinese nation, with its glorious history, can stand alongside the world's great powers and permanently establish the foundation for human peace and progress.</p>
<p>On December 15th of last year, US President Truman issued a statement on US policy toward China when US special envoy Marshal left for China, firmly stating that the US government firmly believes that the success of the United Nations organization and the guarantee of world peace both hinge on the strength, unity, and democracy of the Republic of China. This firm belief of the US government not only represents the opinion of the American people but is also shared by insightful people around the world. A strong, unified, and democratic China is indeed the greatest and most noble goal that our people should strive to achieve in the future.</p>
<p>After the final victory of the war of resistance and the elimination of the Japanese Empire, the only factor hindering China's strength has been eliminated. In the future, China must become prosperous and strong in order to fulfill its major responsibilities for post-war world peace.</p>
<p>However, the so-called strong China refers not only to military equipment but also to the construction of modern politics, economy, society, and culture. It must possess the conditions of a modern country and keep pace with the world trend to achieve a position of strength. A modern and strong country must first achieve unity and stability, and domestic problems, especially political problems, can be resolved satisfactorily through peaceful and reasonable methods and equal consultation. The era of seizing power by revolutionary means or seeking unification by force has become an outdated historical relic. Therefore, using force in domestic warfare, whether called internal strife or rebellion suppression, is a sign of national backwardness.</p>
<p>President Truman stated in his statement: "The failure or devastation of any part of the world is a threat to the peace of the entire world." If China experiences war due to internal problems, it will directly threaten the stability and peace of the world. Therefore, whether China can achieve domestic peace has become a major global issue. The post-war world no longer allows China to engage in self-destruction. Our people should keenly recognize that in order to achieve national unity, especially democratic politics, we should no longer blindly believe in force, but should advance bravely along the path of political consultation, democracy, and peace.</p>
<p>Since the United States dropped the atomic bomb on Japan on August 6th of last year, world scientists have believed that human history has entered a new atomic age. If humans can use the power generated by atomic fission for war, they can destroy the world in a very short time. If it is used for peaceful construction, human life can enter an unimaginably prosperous state.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, a small number of backward people in China have a very mistaken mentality. They believe that China's national strength has not yet been successfully built, and that its own strength is not enough to deal with a second or third strong country. They fantasize about using the friction and conflict between the great powers, or even a third war, to take advantage of the situation. This kind of mentality is extremely erroneous, backward, and dangerous, because among the great powers, only the United States and the Soviet Union are capable of confronting and balancing each other today. If there is a conflict between the US and the Soviet Union that cannot be reconciled, leading to war, then the traitorous country will use atomic bombs to quickly end the war, but no one can guarantee that the Soviet Union will not also use atomic bombs for retaliation. If the conflict between the US and the Soviet Union involves China, then China will inevitably be drawn into the vortex. If this is the case, how will China cope? Therefore, for the sake of China and the world, this kind of erroneous and dangerous mentality must be eliminated. China's future nation-building must strive for domestic and international peace, which is the best policy.</p>
<p>Furthermore, strength, unity, and democracy are inseparable, and democracy is an important prerequisite for strength and unity. If China's democratic politics are not realized and a democratic system cannot be established, then true and lasting strength and unity cannot be achieved. What we seek and what the world hopes for is a strong and unified China based on democracy. If we only seek strength and unity without democratic construction, then Germany and Japan can serve as a warning.</p>
<p>Therefore, the victorious democratic countries demand that China be strong and unified, and at the same time, they demand that China be democratic to avoid the mistakes of Germany and Japan, and do not want China to become a second Japan and become a new threat to the world. In the future, our goal of nation-building must first be to complete the construction of the Principle of Democracy, so that the people have full freedom to express their opinions and decide policies on national politics. In this new year, the people of the whole country should thoroughly understand and unanimously accept President Truman's policy statement on China and strive to realize it, using all kinds of peaceful methods and means to promote the strength, unity, and democracy of the country. This goal is the requirement of the post-war world for China, the responsibility given to China, and the only goal of our future nation-building. I hope that all people with political views in the country can deeply understand this and adhere to this policy with the greatest determination to achieve the goal of building a country based on the Three Principles of the People for the happiness of the country and the peace of the world. For this, I respectfully wish the Republic of China eternal prosperity and the Chinese people boundless happiness!</p>
<h3>Wishing a Victorious New Year and Sending Endless Hopes</h3>
<p>— He Yingqin</p>
<p>Today is the first New Year's Day since the victory of the War of Resistance. The enthusiastic celebrations throughout the country are different from the past. Compatriots in the occupied areas, who have been liberated after eight years of oppression, and Taiwan, which was lost for fifty years, have also returned to the embrace of the motherland, and naturally, everyone is even more happy and inspired. As we welcome the change of year and prepare for the new, we look forward to the future with endless hope. But when we recall the dangers, obstacles, hardships, and the great sacrifices of the military and civilians over the past eight years, as well as all the losses of the country and the powerful assistance of the Allied nations, we must first commemorate and thank the officers, soldiers, and compatriots who sacrificed for the country, as well as the Allied nations that assisted us, especially the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union. Thinking about the difficulty of obtaining victory and the arduousness of future nation-building, we will deeply feel the greatness of our responsibilities and become more vigilant.</p>
<p>Looking back at this painful history is truly thought-provoking. If there had been no warlord separatism after the establishment of the Republic of China, and if the country could have been united after the completion of the Northern Expedition to work hard on nation-building, then with the twenty-plus years from the Xinhai Revolution to the July 7th Incident, according to Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Outline of National Reconstruction, we would have completed democratic politics long ago by transitioning from military government to tutelage government to constitutional government. Moreover, with these twenty-plus years of national defense construction, we could at least have a decent scale, and how would Japan dare to deceive us and invade us? Simply put, it is because the country was not unified and could not build itself into a strong nation that it was subjected to aggression. Today, we feel deeply that the construction of our country cannot be delayed any longer. In other words, what the country urgently needs now is true unification. Only with true unification can we talk about democracy.</p>
<p>Some people think that China's inability to unify is due to the failure to implement democratic politics. This view is completely putting the cart before the horse. If the country is not unified, and there is a phenomenon of separatism and division, and even the use of force as a tool and backing for separatism, and the true will of the people is controlled and manipulated by the separatist forces, then how can there be any democracy? In the world, no matter what kind of political system a country has, there can only be one government that issues orders to ensure the implementation of military and political orders. Although various political parties can criticize the shortcomings of the government in Parliament, everything must be based on the interests of the country, the nation, and the people, and guided by truth. There is absolutely no other government existing besides the central government, and no army in any country that does not obey the orders of the central government. Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union are all countries with democratic politics, but their people can all love the country loyally, and their armies can all absolutely obey the orders of the government. Everyone can sacrifice personal interests, even life, to seek the welfare of the country, so they were able to defeat Germany. If they were divided and orders were not followed, how could they defeat Germany? Therefore, to realize true democratic politics, we must also have a truly unified country.</p>
<p>Compatriots all over the country have been affected by the eight-year war, especially those in the occupied areas, who have been directly subjected to the exploitation and oppression of the Japanese army and traitors, and their lives have been extremely difficult. This is what I have personally seen during my inspections of various places in the past three months. The lives of our ordinary compatriots were already very difficult, but now they are even more unimaginable. Therefore, in the future, we must not only restore the wounds of our compatriots over the past eight years as soon as possible, but also gradually improve the living standards of our compatriots throughout the country, so that everyone can have reasonable solutions to food, clothing, housing, and transportation. However, to this day, it has been more than four months since Japan surrendered, and some compatriots cannot even return to their hometowns because of the destruction of transportation and the lack of restored security. How can we talk about improving living standards? This is because there is still a phenomenon of disunity in the country. Therefore, to restore the wounds of our compatriots over the past eight years and to improve the living standards of our compatriots, we must also have a truly unified country.</p>
<p>Now that the War of Resistance has been won, it is the best opportunity for our country and nation to build and revive. If we let this opportunity for revival pass and cannot concentrate our will and strength to complete the work of unification and nation-building, then the country will inevitably be despised by foreigners again, and even be invaded again, and will never have a chance to recover. At the beginning of this new year, our compatriots throughout the country should make up their minds and not have any selfish ideas. We should be of one mind and unite sincerely, based on the principles of "nation above all" and "national interests above all," and put the responsibility for the rise and fall of the country on our own shoulders. In particular, the officers and soldiers of the national army must understand the importance of their responsibility to protect the country and defend the people. Everyone should work together to promote unification, maintain unification, and consolidate unification. Everyone should work hard to build the country, realize democracy, and improve the living standards of the people. We celebrate the victorious New Year and place infinite hope in the future of the country.</p>

<h3>New Year's Address for the Thirty-Fifth Year</h3>
<p>What day is today? Is it not the New Year's Day of the thirty-fifth year of the Republic of China? Is it not the first time since the victory of the War of Resistance that we have encountered the renewal of the year? The sunshine is just beginning, and hundreds of splendors are flashing. The deep sorrow of China's fragmentation and destruction has followed the old years into insignificance. The excellent and outstanding hope is coming with the new vitality. Everyone, above and below, has this aspiration, and everyone's mind has this new demand. Ask one person, and a hundred mouths will agree. The emotion is inevitable, and the reason is solid. We reporters, whose duty is to be the voice of the people, have a word of dedication to the year at the turn of the year. However, its meaning is profound and far-reaching, and its emotion is so exuberant that there has never been such a thing as this. Why? The eight years of the War of Resistance in the past were already deeply painful. The enemy ravaged us, and the hardships were beyond the ordinary. Millions of sincere and good people were subjected to the cruelty of slavery and torture, or they were dedicated and fearless, or they were displaced and carried away by the flood. The bitterness of this is not worth discussing in depth. When the situation suddenly changed and the devilish obstacles disappeared, due to President Chiang's firm and unyielding leadership, we were finally able to achieve the goal of final victory. It is appropriate for the country to rejoice. However, when we pick up our pens today, we feel that there are still some flickering shadows lingering in our minds, and there are some sour emotions swirling in our chests. Is it a disorder of the spirit? Is it a failure of human planning? Who is in charge? It is difficult to say. It is almost like waking up from a nightmare, with lingering fear. If we encounter something contrary to our wishes, we will become angry and uneasy. Removing the unfortunate past and cherishing the future, we will start anew. I dare to take this opportunity to express a sincere wish.</p>
<p>Since the Japanese warlords, with their ambition to unify the world, embraced the dream of swallowing Asia, disasters and misfortunes gathered together. Germany and Italy, with their foul stench, responded to each other from east to west, and called themselves axis nations, and made a desperate gamble. The smoke of war was overwhelming. The damage and loss of years of war are difficult to estimate with ordinary numbers. Not only was culture destroyed and lives devastated, but the currents reached the point where the world was in danger of sinking, and humanity was lamenting destruction. To call it an ancient and strange disaster is not an exaggeration. However, the facts show that those who are warlike and reckless will eventually commit suicide, and those who uphold justice will be able to hold the ticket to victory. England, America, and the Soviet Union may have different objective doctrines, but their democratic spirit should be consistent. Just as they said that they would learn from the past and be careful in the future, there must be closer cooperation among the three powers. However, the London Conference of Five suddenly announced a loss of communication, and rumors arose, and speculation was rampant. For a time, the gloomy clouds shrouded us again. Why is that? The remnants of fascism have not been completely eliminated, and the alliance itself is not firm. Only because the elimination of evil is incomplete, it is inevitable that there are dormant and concealed generations, secretly launching an attempt to succeed. Only because their unity is not firm, they give people the opportunity to take advantage of the gaps and crevices, and they are calculated without realizing it. A single spark can start a prairie fire. Those who worry about the sky are more than just a few. Fortunately, the Moscow Three-Power Conference was able to quickly reach an agreement to clarify the chaotic situation of no rain for two months. From now on, we can use a more harmonious spirit to seek a more united cooperation, abandon selfish opinions, and express sincere intentions, so that the tragic disasters of the world and the holocaust of the universe will no longer appear before us, and will be completely eliminated from now on. This is one of the things we pray for.</p>
<p>Since the establishment of the Republic of China, warlords have been in chaos and civil wars have been frequent. The people of the country have been deeply tired of suffering and resentment, and they often harbor a curse. After the Northern Expedition was completed and the country was unified, the people in various places began to enjoy the pleasure of living a little. After that, the Japanese invaded, and the soldiers were in constant trouble. In the past eight years, the iron hoofs have spread almost all over the country. At this time, although the people suffered from the pain of oppression, devastation, and death, no one did not regard the victory of the War of Resistance. It is enough to know that the people's hearts are clear, and the foreign invasion should be resisted, and it cannot be compared with the dispute between the walls. Now, after the loss of everything, in this land full of scars, there is a brewing of internal strife and war. How can the melons under the Yellow Terrace be picked again? No wonder people across the country are distressed, running around to warn us. The original brothers and sisters born of the same root and the things of the same kind who seek each other have feelings of harmony and no unsolved grievances. Why must they meet with soldiers and horses to be the final solution? The chants of cooking beans to burn the silk and the rumors of a foot of cloth and a bucket of millet are what the ancients deeply grieved about. Today, they can serve as a warning. Therefore, the Political Consultative Conference is about to be held, and the important figures of the government and the public are sitting together. It is expected that all kinds of complicated and disputed issues can be discussed calmly, and reasonable arrangements can be made, and the people's panic can be eliminated invisibly. This is the most wise measure of our government authorities, and it is also the most favorable gift for the New Year. I hope that all parties and factions can concentrate their opinions, seek mutual understanding, strengthen their belief in sincerity, avoid unnecessary suspicions, and work together to revive the country after the war and lay the foundation for a stable people's livelihood. This is the second thing we earnestly pray for.</p>
<p>The inevitability of eliminating corruption has been a common fact, and the phenomenon of public officials bullying people is also not a phenomenon that should exist in a democratic country, and it must be corrected or punished. The general national character of our country has always been known for its integrity, but it also has its great weaknesses, that is, it cannot maintain its ambitions, and it is easily dominated by the environment, or it ignores its own strength, and it is good to rely on attachment as a good plan. Therefore, when he is a commoner, he is afraid to see the government and is afraid of disputes. Even if there is a coming of injustice, he only takes tolerance as the main thing. Once he gains the support of power, he also thinks about using his power. The so-called one-time officer, the face is completely different, and today, it is really everywhere. A few days ago, President Chiang inspected the old capital and allowed the people to complain about their grievances. He received more than a thousand posts, and those who did not dare to petition were not more than horses. This proves that the people's daily suffering from oppression is not small, and public officials who do not know how to love themselves and use their power for private purposes are seeing more and more of them. There is a President who cares about the people's suffering, but there are no subordinates who deeply embody his efforts. It is a pity. I deeply hope that from now on, the whole country will be vigilant and self-discipline. Those in power should take the heart of President Jiang to protect the people as their heart, and do not use their authority recklessly. Those who are oppressed should know to take the principle of complaining and reporting, and do not seek to indulge and tolerate. The meaning of equality is consistent, and the meaning of democracy is extended. This is the third thing we eagerly look forward to.</p>
<p>The above points are mostly old sayings, and the original essence can be respected. However, to achieve this, it is a common aspiration of the people. It is not a very high argument, it is just to see that our words are in line with what is recited. We hold three wishes to look forward to the glorious beginning of the future and to wait for the prosperity of the Republic of China.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Citizens Enthusiastically Celebrate the First New Year After Victory, Mayor Qian Hosts Leaders from All Walks of Life This Year</h3>
<p>Today is the New Year's Day of the 35th year of the Republic of China, and it is also the first glorious National Founding Day of the Republic of China after victory. All agencies, public organizations, schools, etc. in the city will have a day off, and the entire city will hang national flags to celebrate. In addition to holding a group worship ceremony at the City Hall at 9:00 am, Mayor Qian Dajun will also hold a reception at the conference room on the second floor of the City Hall at 12:00 noon to entertain Chinese and foreign military, political, party, and police officials, as well as celebrities and distinguished guests from all walks of life in society and culture. The Shanghai Branch of the Three People's Principles Youth League and the Municipal Party Department will also hold a joint group worship at the same time. All police stations will be decorated with colorful decorations. General Wedemeyer is scheduled to hold a cocktail party at the Cathay Hotel at 5:00 pm today to entertain American military officers and celebrate New Year's Day in 1946.</p>
<p>End of the Year and Beginning of the Year, Full of Peaceful Atmosphere</p>
<p>Yesterday, Shanghai celebrated New Year's Eve in 1945 for the first time in eight years. This last day of 1945 was full of peaceful atmosphere. Shanghai, the oriental port, has always been known as the "city that never sleeps." This winter, with nearly 10,000 American troops spending New Year's Eve here, it is even more lively. After the recovery of Shanghai, the business of dance halls, bars, and restaurants has doubled. The establishment of so-called "night clubs" (dance halls and bars combined) has sprung up like mushrooms after a rain. Some are operated by Chinese, some are operated by Jews, and there are also many operated by White Russians and French. The films shown in the theaters here are all those that have been screened in the mainland. There are several old films that have been screened for nearly a week, and the box office is still strong. Seeing that the entertainment venues are charging exorbitant prices, the US military has set up several clubs to provide rest and entertainment for the US military. Among them, there is fine wine and music, and the cost of enjoyment is less than one-tenth of the price charged outside. Last night, there were dances in all the US military clubs, and the American Red Cross provided free hospitality to the soldiers. The Military Commission's Battlefield Service Corps and the Allied Forces Service Committee also had various programs to entertain the Allied Forces. The sports programs for New Year's Eve and New Year's Day are more exciting than usual. Major companies and stores are vying to win by designing their large discount advertisements. The streets of Shanghai are crowded with pedestrians all day long, and New Year's Eve is even more bustling. The weather has been clear and sunny for several days. In addition to the deepening cold, there has been no cloudy or foggy weather. Although the New Year's Eve scene is not very significant, the people of Shanghai, who have been under Japanese control for several years, feel that this New Year's Eve is very different from the past once they are free from bondage.</p>
<p>Chinese and American Generals Enjoyed Themselves Together Last Night</p>
<p>Since the Asia Ballroom of the Dashin Company in this city was rented by the Battlefield Service Corps of the Military Commission as a place for the noble entertainment of the Allied and National Armies, last night, on New Year's Eve, senior generals of the Allied and National Armies, including Lieutenant General Wedemeyer, Zhang Yulin, the head of the press liaison group of the Third Front Army, and more than 200 senior Chinese and foreign military officers, Chinese and American soldiers, enjoyed themselves together, and the situation was very enthusiastic, fully demonstrating the spirit of Sino-American friendship.</p>
<h3>A Whistle Blows, A New Beginning</h3>
<p>The first New Year's Day after the victory began with the simultaneous sounding of whistles across the city at the stroke of midnight. What were once air raid sirens have now transformed into sounds of peace, lasting for half an hour, giving residents a sense of renewal with each whistle. Simultaneously, naval vessels in the Huangpu River shone their lights, illuminating the city, symbolizing brightness, to celebrate the New Year's Day of the 35th year.</p>
<h3>Wang Shuxian and Yu Jianmin Arrested Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Wang Shuxian, the third son of the late philanthropist Wang Yiting, 53 years old, from Wuxing, residing at 64 Route Doumer, had served as a compradore for Nisshin Kisen Kaisha for many years. During the enemy and puppet period, he was once in charge of the "puppet organization's" grain monopoly. Yu Jianmin, 45 years old, from Zhenhai, residing at No. 8, Lane 5, Rue de Gasi, had served as the "Business Director of the puppet organization's China Merchants Steam Navigation Company." Both were arrested at their residences yesterday by military authorities on suspicion of aiding the enemy.</p>
<h3>Another Foreign Spy, Mike Berou, Detained</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Following Shali'er, another foreign spy named Mike Berou was captured by our Songhu Garrison Headquarters. He claimed to be of Dutch nationality, but after investigation, he was found to be a member of the Nazi Party. During the War of Resistance, he specialized in collecting important information about the United Nations and secretly providing it to Germany. After the victory, he resided near Rue Lingsen and Rue Muling, living a secluded life. After days of investigation by the Headquarters, he was finally captured a few days ago in a bar on Wuchang Road, Hongkou, and is currently detained at the Dege Bridge concentration camp.</p>
<h3>Murderous Demon Brothers Dos Arrested</h3>
<p>The Russian murderous demon brothers Dos were arrested one after another a few days ago. During the enemy occupation, they boasted of having killed many people, and countless patriotic individuals were murdered by them. The elder of these two murderers is named Shaji Dos, and the younger is named Balis Dos. They initially worked as special agents in the puppet Manchukuo Military Police, and came to Shanghai in the 28th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1939]. They then joined the ranks of Wu Shibin under "76." All major assassinations carried out by "76" were presided over by the Dos brothers. The unprecedented large-scale assassination bloodbath at the Jiangsu Farmers Bank in the 29th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1940], and the major acts of violence in which the Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury was bombed several times, resulting in more than a dozen deaths and injuries, were all the "masterpieces" of the Dos brothers. They always carried two pistols with them and could fire with both hands. Their agility and accuracy with firearms were second to none among the enemy and puppet executioners. After the victory, their whereabouts were extremely secretive. The American military here had investigated them, but failed to capture them. A few days ago, Shaji Dos was finally captured by our side. Balis Dos was also implicated in another arms trafficking case and a lead was obtained. He was captured by the Investigation Department of the Garrison Headquarters the night before last. It is reported that Dos has admitted to his atrocities at "76."</p>
<h3>Vehicles Keep to the Right, Starting This Morning</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Starting at 6:00 AM this morning, vehicles across the country began to drive on the right side of the road at the same time, and pedestrians are required to keep to the side. The Municipal Bureau of Public Works has completed the reconstruction of all tram waiting platforms in the city and has also replaced the "turn right" signs at midnight last night. Today, the police局 will dispatch a large number of traffic police to direct vehicles and maintain order in the bustling street areas.</p>
<h3>Mr. Ye and Mr. Niu Sympathize with and Relieve the Hidden Poor</h3>
<p>The Central Government's special envoys, Ye Chucang and Niu Yongjian, after arriving in Shanghai, noted that many hidden poor people in the area were coming to plead their difficulties. Therefore, they requested the Shanghai branch of the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration to coordinate everything, so that honest and upright people could gradually alleviate their distress.</p>
<h3>The Truth About Jiang Weizu's Rumored Detention</h3>
<p>Recently, various newspapers have repeatedly published reports about the chief prosecutor of the Taiwan High Court, Jiang Weizu, going to Chongqing to report on his duties and being mistakenly reported as being detained. Yesterday, our reporter visited relevant figures in Shanghai's legal circles to inquire about the truth of the case. According to them, Jiang's ancestral home is Jiangsu, he has a bachelor's degree in law from Great China University, and later graduated from the judge training institute. He has served as president and chief prosecutor of courts in Zunyi, Qijiang, Luxian, Wanxian, and other places. He is known for his upright character, integrity, and hard work. This spring, the Ministry of Justice launched a training class for judicial personnel in Taiwan, and Jiang was transferred to receive training. Upon completion, he ranked first in his class. After the victory, he was promoted to the position of chief prosecutor of the Taiwan High Court. After arriving in Taiwan, due to differences in style with the court in handling handover matters, he was summoned to Chongqing to report the details. On December 14, Jiang boarded an American military plane to Shanghai and then to Chongqing with documents personally signed by Chief Executive Chen Yi. Various bizarre rumors immediately spread, which were believed to be malicious slander from those who were jealous of him. In addition to the Ministry of Judicial Administration denying this in newspapers in Chongqing, the relevant authorities are currently investigating and handling the matter.</p>
<h3>Flagpole Installation Fees Vary Between Districts</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The various police stations in the city were ordered to standardize the method of hanging the national flag throughout the city, and ordered the various sub-bureaus to hire workers to install iron frames and flagpoles. According to the announced prices, each set of triangular frames costs 450 yuan, and each flagpole costs 255 yuan, totaling 705 yuan. However, the amounts charged in various districts of the city vary. Most of them are higher than the prescribed prices. Our newspaper's reporters specifically investigated the actual prices paid by citizens in various districts, and the figures are as follows: Huangpu District, 705 yuan; Old Gate District, two types: 705 yuan and 955 yuan; New City District, 960 yuan; Taishan District, 955 yuan; Changshu District, two types: 955 yuan and 1,000 yuan; Jing'an Temple District, 955 yuan.</p>
<h3>British Ship Yushan Encounters Danger, Investigation Reveals It Ran Aground</h3>
<p>The British ship Promethius, which transported more than 6,700 bags of wheat from the US Relief Administration to Shanghai, encountered difficulties in navigation when it sailed to the waters of Yushan, 90 nautical miles from the Wusongkou, and entered the port yesterday afternoon. According to the ship's crew, on the evening of the 26th, when sailing to the waters near Yushan, it suddenly ran aground, and the bow cabin hit a reef, immediately piercing a hole. Seawater entered, but fortunately, the ship's cabins were separated, so only the bow cabin was flooded, and the second cabin was unaffected. The shipowner immediately took rescue measures to plug the hole.</p>
<h3>Abolition of Livestock Monopoly Tax Implemented from New Year's Day</h3>
<p>Mayor Qian gave a speech yesterday about the abolition of the livestock monopoly tax: "It has been found that the city's livestock monopoly tax is levied on livestock passing through the border, similar to the old likin. It was originally a bad policy during the enemy and puppet period. After the city was recovered, various taxes were gradually sorted out, and the consumer special tax, poultry special tax, beef and mutton special tax, miscellaneous license tax, telephone donation, gold special tax, etc., which disturbed the people and did not comply with the central government's regulations, were abolished in succession. Now, in order to take into account the difficulties of the people and avoid harsh harassment, this livestock monopoly tax will be abolished starting from New Year's Day of the 35th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1946]. The Bureau of Finance has been ordered to do so, in order to relieve the people's difficulties."</p>
<h3>American Invention: "Scented" Movies</h3>
<p>According to the China Amateur Radio Association, an American film studio has recently produced a film that, in addition to having sound and color like ordinary sound films, can also allow the audience to smell various fragrances at the same time, corresponding to the plot of the film. This kind of "scented" movie is truly a shining point in the film industry. Scientific progress is endless, which is amazing.</p>
<h3>Military Authorities in the City Rectify Military Discipline, Arrest 97 Soldiers Who Caused Trouble</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Regarding the unfortunate incidents that have occurred recently in various cinemas and theaters in the city, the soldiers involved will be severely punished. In order to prevent similar incidents from happening again in the future, the Songhu Garrison Headquarters has drafted a plan, which will be implemented after Chief Commander Qian approves it. Generally, soldiers will be allowed to enjoy entertainment once a week, and the time will be set during the daytime. This is in accordance with Chairman Chiang's handwritten order that soldiers are not allowed to go out without reason after 6:00 PM every day. The preferential theater tickets will be sent to the Garrison Headquarters by the theaters and then distributed. When each theater opens, the Songhu Garrison Headquarters will send troops to supervise, and anyone who enters the theater without a ticket will be prohibited.</p>
<p>More than 120 soldiers were arrested the night before last at the China Grand Theater on Niuzhuang Road for causing trouble while trying to watch a free show. However, about 20 of them were found to have been arrested for forcibly trying to pass through the prohibited area where the incident occurred. The Garrison Headquarters released them yesterday morning because they were not related to the trouble caused by watching a free show. The remaining 97 are still temporarily detained in the Old Gate Branch Bureau and will be severely punished separately to serve as a warning and rectify discipline. Regarding the military discipline of soldiers in this city, Mayor Qian had received a telegram from Chairman Chiang two months ago, ordering that "From October 1st, officers and soldiers are not allowed to go out except on Sundays, and on Sundays, they must all return to their units before 6:00 PM without delay. Senior officers at all levels should set an example and strictly comply to avoid undermining discipline, harming military reputation, and preventing the gradual deterioration of the physical and mental strength of officers and soldiers." After receiving the order, Mayor Qian immediately forwarded it to the military units and military organs in the city for strict compliance, and then repeatedly reiterated the previous order that officers and soldiers must not enter the theater without a ticket, and the Garrison Headquarters stipulated regulations for soldiers to watch theater. However, some soldiers still did not obey the order, forcibly watched free shows, and repeatedly beat theater personnel. The authorities were extremely angry about this and resolved to rectify the military discipline in the city as soon as possible. The Investigation Department of the Garrison Headquarters first arrested and punished all the soldiers who caused trouble at the China Grand Theater last night and planned to prevent similar incidents from happening again. At 10:00 AM yesterday morning, Director Cheng Yiming of the Investigation Department personally went to the Old Gate Branch Bureau to speak to all the arrested soldiers who caused trouble. Cheng detailed the responsibilities and duties that soldiers should fulfill and the discipline they should observe, and told them that their mistakes this time not only damaged the reputation of soldiers but also hindered the reputation of the entire country. After listening to the speech, some soldiers were moved to tears. Cheng left the Old Gate Branch Bureau and returned to the Headquarters at 11:15 AM.</p>
<p>The unfortunate incidents of soldiers causing disturbances in various cinemas, Peking opera theaters, and dance halls in the city for days are deeply and greatly related to the city's public security and military discipline. Our reporter specially visited the Changju of the Third Front Army stationed in Shanghai for this matter. According to the organization, after the headquarters of the Third Front Army and the Nanjing-Shanghai Garrison Headquarters moved to Wuxi, only the Shanghai Command Post was established here, responsible for handling the repatriation of Japanese prisoners of war and all unfinished surrender matters. All troops stationed in the city are not within the command system of the Command Post. The incidents of military disturbances for days are indeed related to public security and should be investigated and severely punished by the responsible authorities to rectify military discipline.</p>
<h3>Major Extortion Case on Taicang Road, Preliminary Hearing Yesterday, Ring Leader Claims to be a College Student</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] On the 7th of last month, at the residence of tobacco merchant Li Wenxiang at No. 158 Taicang Road, Zhao Shiji, who falsely claimed to be a confidential secretary of the Intelligence Section of the US Army Headquarters, suddenly led three accomplices, riding in a black-licensed car, to Li's residence and extorted a huge sum of money from Wenxiang. The driver, Jiji, climbed over the wall and secretly reported it to the Taishan Branch Bureau, and they were all arrested on the spot, sent to the Garrison Headquarters, and punished according to law. Yesterday, the chief culprit was questioned by the Military Law Office. According to his confession, his name is Zhao Shiyi, 29 years old, from Shaoxing, residing at No. 2 Apartment, North End of Sichuan Road. He had studied at St. John's University for three years and studied at Waseda University in Japan. He falsely claimed to be a confidential secretary of the Intelligence Section of the US Army Headquarters, forged documents, and signed his name as Major Major Malson, Chief of the Intelligence Section of the US Army Headquarters. He did not deny leading three accomplices to extort money. He was forced to take this measure due to unemployment, but his subordinates and accomplices have not yet known their true identity. After an hour and a half of interrogation, he was ordered to be temporarily detained. Our reporter learned that when the suspect was arrested by the Taishan Branch Bureau, his clothes were neat and his documents were complete. The documents were sent to the US Army Headquarters in writing. According to the reply, there were no such personnel, and he was ordered to be severely punished. Therefore, the case was reported to the Headquarters for handling according to law.</p>
<h3>Zhou Yiwei's Case of Enlisting Laborers for the Enemy Concluded, Debate Ended and Sentencing Scheduled for the 7th</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The case of traitor Zhou Yiwei enlisting laborers to supply the enemy was heard at the Shanghai Prison High Court in Tilanqiao at 9:30 AM yesterday. First, Prosecutor Lin read out the main points of the indictment, stating that the defendant had served as a translator and instructor at the former "Shanghai Branch Office of the Petroleum Joint Venture for Recruiting Chinese Laborers." In May of the 33rd year [of the Republic, i.e., 1944], he was entrusted by the office to use huge</p>
<p>wages as bait</p>
<p>and recruited about 80 laborers in the Yangshupu area. After gathering them in Pudong, they were transported by ship to Taiwan and other places to be used by the enemy's military. On October 4th of last year, Tang Qinzhang and others, family members of the recruited laborers, tied up the defendant at No. 30, Yongchang Lane, Lane 385, East Changzhi Road, and handed him over to the police局, who transferred him to the Prosecutor's Office. The facts have been admitted by the defendant and testified by family members of the recruited laborers at the police局. There are also two or more people whose whereabouts are still unknown and two certificates. It is sufficient to prove that the defendant violated Article 2, Paragraph 3 of the Regulations on Punishing Traitors,</p>
<p>communicating with enemy countries</p>
<p>and recruiting laborers for military use. He requested the court to punish him according to law. Then, Zhou Yiwei asked Judge Liu for leniency. Subsequently, the defendant's lawyer, Yu Huimin, stood up to defend him, listing eight reasons and requesting the court to declare him innocent. At 10:15 AM, Judge Liu announced the end of the debate, the defendant was returned to custody, and sentencing was scheduled for the 7th.</p>
<h3>Dong Xianguang's Translation, Best Seller in the City</h3>

According to the victim's wife, she has applied to the Shanghai Women's Association for assistance and entrusted lawyers Zhang Hongwei, Lu Huimin, and Li Suzhen to appeal to the court according to law, demanding that the murderer be severely punished and compensation for damages be paid.

<h3>After the Announcement of the Taiwan Dollar Exchange Rate, Gold Notes Show a Slight Decline, Chinese and Foreign Stocks Still Trend Strong</h3>
<p>Because yesterday's newspapers reported the exchange rate of the Taiwan dollar to the legal tender was temporarily set at 1 to 30, and US$1 could be exchanged for NT$37.05, some people estimated the new exchange rate of the US dollar should be 1,111.5 yuan, triggering a selling trend. The opening price in the morning fell from 805,000 to a low of 790,000. Later, due to the absorption of US dollars by large investors, it was able to be supported. At this time, the output of US dollars to gold has been as low as 570 yuan or less, and there are quite a few people who exchanged notes for gold. It gradually rose back to 808,000. At noon, the bulls and bears fought slightly, hovering around 800,000. In the afternoon, it rose slightly to around 805,000, a slight drop of 7,000 compared to last Saturday. Silver bullion was 86,000, silver 600 yuan, silver dollar 440 yuan, and the secret discount was initially weak at one tenth of a yuan, but later, due to the slight setbacks in gold stocks, the road was slightly stagnant, about eight cents.</p>
<p>Because the temporary exchange rate of the Taiwan dollar to the legal tender and the US dollar has been announced by Chief Executive Chen, the general public calculated that the US exchange rate was only over 1,110 yuan (this is the price of the Taiwan Bank's exchange of Taiwan dollars, which was ignored by the general public), and the prices in Chongqing's note market were also reported lower, and people's hearts were slightly hit, but large investors took advantage of the low price to absorb them. After opening at 1,385 yuan in the morning, it gradually rose to 1,425 yuan, struggling around 1,420 yuan at noon. As a result, it fell back a little compared to last Saturday by 10 yuan. The Hong Kong dollar is still stable, and there is news that the exchange rate between Hong Kong and Shanghai is flattening. Many non-industry people are interested in new goods, forming an excess of demand over supply. As a result, compared with last Saturday, old goods were flat, while new goods were 2 yuan better.</p>
<p>Due to the closing of accounts by people in the government bond industry, there were no public sales yesterday, but the dark market slightly opened at the previous day's closing price.</p>
<p>Large investors in Chinese stocks repeatedly used a strategy of wanting to catch but letting go, first releasing and then receiving. As a result, the upper market was quite weak. Cotton mills retreated to the 800 yuan mark, Meiya broke the 600 yuan mark, Xingguang saw a transaction of 49 yuan, and Qinxing broke the 40 yuan mark. Immediately, large investors came out to cover their positions, and individual investors rushed to cheer, and non-industry people also divested gold to buy stocks, and the recovery was particularly rapid. Cotton mills saw a high price of 900 yuan, Meiya 700 yuan, Xingguang rose to over 57 yuan, Jingfu 53 yuan, and Qinxing 48 yuan. Near noon, large investors first released and then advanced a second time, and the shares wrote back more than half a percent, but the closing price was still pulled up. In the end, Meiya rose sharply, and the trend was even stronger than that of cotton mills. As a result, compared with the previous closing price, cotton mills rose by 50 yuan, Meiya by 75 yuan, Xingguang by 3 yuan, Jingfu by 4.5 yuan, and Dongxing by 5 yuan. All small and medium-sized unpopular stocks were also able to keep up.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks also moved up and down with Chinese stocks, and were extremely firm in the middle of the day. The noon closing gradually stabilized. As a result, compared with last Saturday, Yisha rose by 230 yuan, Yipi by 20 yuan, Paper Industry by 15 yuan, and Rubber stocks were still in excess demand, but the supply of goods increased gradually with a 10% increase in the closing price.</p>
<h3>Spot Yarn Sales are Smooth</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market continued to soar, because passenger sales from all directions were still extremely active, and they all took spot goods as their goal. The going rate for customers from Shantou and Xiamen was quite smooth, and customers from Beijing and Hangzhou also absorbed them as the market rose. Most of them were 20 counts, and the price rose by about 20,000. Cloth factories and socks factories still need fine yarn and double money, and the price has risen by another 560,000. Although the supply and sale from the factory side is not much, the people in the industry think that it is extremely flat.</p>
<h3>White Coal Price Increase Slows</h3>
<p>The coal market is as firm and stable as ever. Due to the year-end, transactions are slow. The price increase of Yangquan white coal has gradually slowed down, but it remains stable at its peak. Lump bituminous coal is eagerly sought after by users, and the market is trending briskly. Bituminous coal from layered factories sells very slowly, and the potential is quite soft. Although the arrival of firewood from overseas has decreased, the arrival on inland rivers has increased instead. However, there are also many buyers who are actually selling, and the price remains stable.</p>
<h3>Banking Industry Holiday for Three Days</h3>
<p>Today (the 1st) is the founding anniversary of the Republic of China. The 2nd and 3rd are for the banking industry to handle the annual accounting. All banks, firms, and exchanges in the city will uniformly take a three-day holiday. However, various companies, firms, the Jianghai Customs, and the Post Office will only take a one-day holiday. During the holiday period, all bill exchanges will be handled after resumption of business, it is said.</p>
<h3>Rice Market Stable, Peanuts and Sesame Slightly Rise</h3>
<p>The rice market digestion is still weak. Northern rice is moving but not brisk, leading to a stagnant situation. However, early thin rice from central, lower, and southern regions shows a slight increase of 100 yuan. After the continuous sharp drop in Baiyin yuan, yesterday, due to the stores taking advantage of a clever pickup, it recovered from fatigue and rose again, increasing by 300 to 500 yuan. Flour is sluggish, continuing down by 100 to 200 yuan. Medium and inferior miscellaneous brands are oversupplied and lack buyers, with prices down by 200 to 300 yuan. The oil market continues down by several hundred yuan. Flat-price oil is being sold by various oil stores, and it is expected to be sold after the New Year's opening. A portion has already been distributed, and there will be continued distribution in the future. Soybean cakes in Shantou and Xiamen continue to be processed and remain firmly established. The high price of soybeans is slightly reduced. Peanuts are exceptionally popular, increasing by another 1000 yuan. The price of sesame has risen by more than 1000 yuan, and the destocking is still active. Cottonseed cake is firming due to the rising price of fuel. Wheat bran is stable. The wine market is expected to rise from tomorrow.</p>
<h3>Summary of Market Conditions</h3>
<p>A fierce price increase has been triggered in the dye market. Large quantities are being absorbed in Jiangbei, Hankou, Qingdao, Wenzhou, and other areas. As a result, dyes such as vulcanized black, indigo powder, double goose yuan, and fast indigo have all increased by 20% to 30% compared to last weekend.</p>
<p>Walnuts have not completed the customs declaration procedures for arriving ships, and delivery must wait until after the New Year holiday. Therefore, dealers who have existing stock are reluctant to sell, and bargaining is brisk.</p>
<p>Twelve-pound fine cloth white fabric is still in short supply. Dyeing and weaving factories are eager to dye them and are willing to pay higher prices to purchase them.</p>
<h3>The Financial and Commercial Situation Over the Past Year</h3>
<p>— Chong Bo</p>
<p>The 34th year of the Republic was the most painful and darkest period for Shanghai's entire society. Although Germany and Japan surrendered in May and August respectively, and victory belonged to our country, the price inflation surged turbulently, and the depreciation rate of counterfeit currency was shockingly low. It was truly a memorable page in Shanghai's commercial history. Recalling the past events, I will describe them as follows:</p>
<p>Finance: At the beginning of the year, credit was relaxed, with the daily interest rate for 1000 yuan only at 3%. In late January, it was changed to 6.5%. It was not until late August, when World War II ended and prices began to fall sharply, that banks and money shops closed down and went into liquidation in large numbers. The rate gradually decreased from 3% to 2%, and even fell to 0.5% in late September. After October, when the exchange rate of 200 counterfeit yuan to 1 legal tender was determined, the use of silver by the speculative market and hoarding households increased, and it rose again from 1% to 3%, remaining unchanged until the end of the year. The highest interest rate was probably 50% in early August when Russia declared war on Japan, but it only lasted for three to five days in the stock market. The counterfeit currency fluctuated around 800,000 yuan in early January. On the 17th, it reached a low of 760,000 yuan. In late January, it broke through the 1 million yuan mark, and from then on, it soared. In late February, during the red plate trading at the beginning of the lunar year, it was suddenly rumored that Japanese merchants and Deng's troops were buying up, breaking through 3 million yuan. In early March, it was heard that the price of gold in Chongqing was cheap, and counterfeit gold securities were listed, causing the price to weaken slightly. Later, as the situation in Germany deteriorated, speculative buying became tighter. In mid-April, it suddenly reached 12 million yuan. In May, when Germany had surrendered, counterfeit gold securities were oversupplied and slightly leveled off. In June and July, as Japan suffered repeated defeats in the Pacific War, the price of gold soared. In late July, when the atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima, the price of ten taels of gold rose to 130 million yuan. On August 10, Emperor Hirohito of Japan announced unconditional and total surrender, and the peak reached 200 million counterfeit yuan. At that time, as the world war ended, our troops were successively airlifted to Shanghai, and hoarding households rushed to sell, causing it to plummet to 23 million yuan in just nine days. However, at that time, the exchange rate of counterfeit currency was only 60 or 70 to 1. Afterwards, the black market price of counterfeit currency fell further, and the price of gold rose further, returning to 10.6 million yuan. It was not until September 28, when it was clearly stipulated that 200 to 1, and all prices in Shanghai were traded in legal tender, that the price of gold stood at 384,000 yuan. In late October, the reception of North China and the Nine Northeastern Provinces suffered setbacks, and the negotiations between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party failed, causing asset owners and speculators to buy gold again. On the 31st, it saw a peak of 1.1 million yuan, which was 20 million yuan higher than the peak of 200 million counterfeit yuan on August 11. In November, it hovered around 800,000 to 900,000 yuan. Later, due to the resumption of sea transportation and the beginning of foreign trade, the US dollar fell to 1000 yuan on December 11. Due to the understanding of 60 US dollars per tael of gold, the price of gold fell to 583,000 yuan. However, the financial authorities were quite in favor of raising the US dollar exchange rate to reduce the large amount of imported goods in order to protect the country's nascent industries. Therefore, it returned to a high of 813,000 yuan at the end of the year, which was 33,000 yuan higher in legal tender than the 780,000 counterfeit yuan at the end of the 33rd year, and actually a huge increase of 161.82 million counterfeit yuan. The price of silver was the same as at the end of last year, but it also rose significantly in counterfeit currency. At the beginning of the year, the US dollar was sold for 1200 yuan. In late September, after our troops reached Shanghai, the US dollar soared to 170,000 counterfeit yuan. In early October, after switching to pricing in legal tender, the low was 675 yuan. Later, due to the uncertainty of foreign exchange, import and export merchants used the US dollar as the price standard for goods. On the 31st, the peak was 1780 yuan. On December 10, when American and British banks resumed operations, it was suspected that the US exchange rate would be listed, and the US dollar fell to 930 yuan. Finally, because our country's laws did not allow foreign merchants to re-engage in foreign exchange, and the authorities tended to raise the US dollar, it rebounded. At the end of the year, it closed at 1430 yuan in legal tender, which was 430 yuan higher in legal tender than the 1000 counterfeit yuan at the end of the 33rd year, and actually an increase of 185,000 counterfeit yuan.</p>
<p>Securities: Among government bonds, the Unified C-type was the most active. At the beginning of January, it stood at 360 yuan. Later, due to the increase in the exchange rate of legal tender and the international situation being favorable to our country, the market price gradually rose. In mid-August, the Japanese army surrendered, and it soared to 170,000 yuan. After switching to pricing in legal tender in late September, it once fell to 210 yuan in late October due to face value repayment. Finally, due to rumors of Sun Yat-sen's bonds being redeemed and victory subsidies, and at the same time, the exhaustion of actual chips, it caused a short squeeze. On December 19, the peak reached 850 yuan, which was comparable to the peak of 170,000 counterfeit yuan in August. At the end of the year, it closed at 770 yuan, which was 390 yuan higher than at the end of the 33rd year. The buying of Chinese and foreign stocks was very tight, and both closed at new high prices at the end of the year. The leading Chinese stock, Wing On Textile Factory, closed at 820 yuan at the end of the year, which was 395 yuan higher than at the end of the 33rd year.</p>
<p>Goods: Among commodities, yarn and flower cloth fell in name but rose in reality. Raw silk rose greatly in both name and reality due to export relations. British and American cigarettes also rose sharply due to foreign merchants and American tobacco leaves. White coal rose in both name and reality due to insufficient inventory. Although other goods fell in name, they were all higher than in the 33rd year when calculated based on the counterfeit currency exchange rate. The market prices of major commodities are listed for comparison below. (Unit: Yuan)</p>

<h3>New Year Start</h3>
<p>— Jin Chun</p>
<p>"New Year starts writing, all things are auspicious."</p>
<p>"New Year writes in red, all things are prosperous."</p>
<p>I remember from my childhood, every New Year, the first thing to do in the morning was to follow the adults and respectfully write auspicious words on strips of cut red paper. After writing, we would paste them on the wall next to the desk, and we would always go to look at them. At that time, I didn't quite understand the meaning of these sentences, but I was always so excited when writing them.</p>
<p>The auspicious words for the New Year start writing are pasted new every year, and then fade away with the years. I gradually developed a kind of attachment to writing auspicious words for the New Year start writing, and even more boundless regret.</p>
<p>Originally, a literati who made a living by the pen was naturally very cherished by his pen. The pen made him satisfied, but it also made him disappointed; the pen made him happy, but it also made him sad; the pen made him glorious, but it also made him shamed and unfortunate. He longed to use his pen to complete his great task, unwilling to write those trivial and untuned works; he longed to use his pen to describe the happy things of mankind, unwilling to record those tragic and unfortunate events; he longed to use his pen to freely express his thoughts and convey the public opinion of society, not wanting to get into unexpected disputes because of words. In the past, this kind of wish was probably not easy to achieve, but at least it was what he had always longed for. So, every New Year, we can easily imagine: he writes on red paper with that pious mood; "All things are auspicious," "All things are prosperous." I no longer see that it is a seasonal decoration, no longer feel that it contains some slight superstition or clichéd components, I see that the red paper strips fade year after year, and are pasted new year after year, I sympathize with the sadness of the literati, and even more admire the greatness of the literati.</p>
<p>For the past eight years, I have neglected the matter of writing for the New Year start writing, and the red paper strips pasted on the wall many years ago have also faded into a blur.</p>
<p>Today is the first New Year after victory. When I got up early in the morning, I was filled with a special excitement, felt more sincere and more confident, and wrote on red paper:</p>
<p>"New Year starts writing, all things are auspicious."</p>
<p>"New Year writes in red, all things are prosperous."</p>
<p>I take these two auspicious words to encourage myself, and I respectfully use these two auspicious words to congratulate the readers.</p>
<p>Customs</p>
<h3>New Year Anecdotes</h3>
<p>— Dong Xin</p>
<p>New Year's Eve Vigil</p>
<p>"Customs Records" says: "In the customs of Shu, until New Year's Eve, people stay awake all night, which is called 'guarding the year.'" Su Dongpo's poem "Guarding the Year" says: "Wanting to know the year that is about to end is like rushing to catch up with a fleeing snake." People in Europe and America also have the custom of guarding the year. On New Year's Eve, they sit and stay awake, quietly listening to the bells in the church ringing out the old and welcoming the new. It is said that the ringing of these bells on New Year's Eve originated with the ancient British. According to British customs, before twelve o'clock on New Year's Eve, the bell is covered with cloth, and what is heard is a low sound. As soon as it strikes twelve o'clock, the cloth is immediately removed, and the bell immediately emits a clear and loud sound. One represents the declining old year, and the other symbolizes the brand new New Year. Men of letters also love to listen to the sound of bells. Deng Lisheng has a poem about hearing the bells on New Year's Eve, and Lan Bai also said, "The most solemn and moving of all bell sounds is the New Year's Eve bell."</p>
<p>New Year's Gift Giving</p>
<p>In our country, giving gifts for the New Year is a very old custom. In the West, giving New Year's gifts originated with the ancient Romans. Originally, the Romans were supposed to give gifts to the senators on New Year's Day, so that the senators would protect them during the year. The Roman Emperor Claudius even set a law stipulating that senators should not solicit gifts at ordinary times, but could openly solicit them on New Year's Day. Historians Suetonius and Tacitus have detailed records of this type of custom. At that time, the gifts given were just small trinkets. The custom of giving New Year's gifts later spread to the British, and gradually spread throughout Europe. In England, during the reign of Queen Elizabeth, the custom of giving New Year's gifts was most popular, and the gifts given were also increasingly extravagant and varied. It is said that Queen Elizabeth's first pair of black silk stockings was a New Year's gift from a favored minister, which was the beginning of women wearing silk stockings, because before that, Queen Elizabeth had always worn cloth stockings.</p>
<p>Speaking of giving New Year's gifts, among the Western countries today, France and Spain are probably the most authentic. At one time, the most common New Year's gift was gloves. Later, everyone became accustomed to using candy. Monthly calendars were also very popular because they were very timely. Recently, many people like to buy books as New Year's gifts.</p>
<p>New Year Greetings</p>
<p>We still follow the custom of New Year group greetings. Some elderly people and women, who do not go out all year round, will also cheer up, put on new clothes, and go out to pay their respects on New Year's Day. There is a book that talks about the British New Year's greetings very interestingly. The British habit of New Year's greetings was also learned from the Romans. At one time, everyone took this etiquette very seriously. On New Year's Day, the whole family would go out to pay New Year's greetings, but as a result, everyone couldn't meet anyone, because everyone was not at home. In fact, our New Year's greetings are also like this.</p>
<p>The American custom of New Year's greetings was passed down from the Dutch, because the Dutch are the most polite and hospitable. However, nowadays, because people are busy, this ancient custom has gradually become less valued in European and American countries.</p>
<p>Celebrating the New Year</p>
<p>Although the way various countries celebrate the New Year is equally enthusiastic, the methods are somewhat different. In European and American countries, Christmas is usually more lively than the New Year, but among them, the French pay more attention to the New Year. The New Year seems to be a social season.</p>
<p>People in Scotland have a superstition that whoever is the first to visit someone's house on New Year's Day will have good luck all year round. You are early, and I am early. Later, as soon as the clock strikes twelve on New Year's Eve, the New Year's greetings have already entered the house, so everyone celebrates wildly all night.</p>
<p>In the era of Imperial Russia, New Year's celebrations involved firing cannons. Nowadays, in Norway, Sweden, and other countries, people still like to fire guns when celebrating the New Year, so that all that can be heard during the New Year is the sound of guns and cannons.</p>
<p>On New Year's Day in Japan, pine, bamboo, and shrimp are hung on the door. It is said that pine represents longevity, bamboo represents youth, and shrimp represents happiness.</p>
<p>The most common way to celebrate the New Year is to have a big meal, but the way of eating and the types of food vary from place to place. Savages eat to wish for strong bodies, while civilized people also mix in superstitions about good luck when they eat. It is said that Persians eat eggs during the New Year, because eggs symbolize new life. That's why Westerners also give eggs at Easter. We also eat tea eggs during the New Year, but they represent the original reality.</p>

<h3>Passing the New Year, Becoming a New Person</h3>
<p>— Jian Ru</p>
<p>In the blink of an eye, thirty-four years have passed unconsciously. What follows is the New Year of the thirty-fifth year, which is worth seizing—the first New Year after the victory of the War of Resistance. This is how I see it: passing the New Year, becoming a new person.</p>
<p>In fact, I misspoke. What is the New Year? What is a new person? Originally, the New Year is the moment of the future. A new person is someone who generates new strength in that moment, engages in new development, and toils to become a new person. The elusive moment is the New Year. We must seize the moment and remake our lives.</p>
<p>There are so many incomplete lives in the world that have shattered their fate. Byron's foot was lame, Beethoven's ear was deaf, Miró, with his flat nose, and Milton, who was blind—how unfortunate they were, their lives were flawed. However, they constantly struggled and resisted, constantly demanded to pass the New Year, and finally demonstrated their genius, achieved great careers, and became new people.</p>
<p>The New Year—what is the New Year? Every day is the New Year, as long as we strive every day. There is a bright lamp burning ahead. As long as we have the efforts of Byron, Beethoven, and Milton, and continue to move forward, the bright lamp will fall into our hands, and we will be new people.</p>

<h3>Forget Eight Eggs and Rampant Eight Eggs</h3>
<p>— Du Yun</p>
<p>It is said that there was an old couplet that said, "One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, filial piety, fraternal love, loyalty, faith, propriety, righteousness, and integrity." The former hides "forget eight," and the latter hides "shameless." For this reason, in Mandarin cursing, there is the phrase "forget eight eggs." Today, we are delighted to celebrate the New Year's Day of the thirty-fifth year of our great Republic of China. How can we scold people? Let's explain these two phrases.</p>
<p>"Forget eight eggs" means we can forget the past eight New Year's Days. Those days were difficult, and the environment was depressing. Now we have won. We are passing this ninth New Year's Day, the sun and sky are shining again, and the world is at peace. We wish for the country to be settled this year, everything to be on track, prices to fall, people's livelihood problems to be solved, the nation to be built successfully, and the glory of a great power to be maintained, just like "a woman who is in labor has sorrow because her hour has come; but when she has given birth to the child, she no longer remembers the anguish, for joy that a child has been born into the world." After enduring the hardships of the past, this so-called "War of Resistance is a process!" has produced a lively and vibrant truly free country, and the true meaning of the revolution has been completed. This so-called "nation-building is the goal." With the goal achieved, how can we not rejoice!</p>
<p>Also, the enemy used to seek out opportunities to invade, always liking to create a day with the number eight, such as September 18th, January 28th, August 13th, and January 28th. Now that the enemy has surrendered, the coming of this New Year's Day tells us not to commemorate these ominous eights anymore. This is also called "forget eight eggs."</p>
<p>As for the people and property of our former occupied territories, which suffered the enemy's eight years of rampaging, passing through eight New Year's Days, this is called "rampant eight eggs." By the time of the ninth New Year's Day, that country that disturbed world peace and harbored the ambition to invade has been defeated and can no longer be rampant.</p>
<p>Society</p>
<h3>Coincidental Folk Prophecies</h3>
<p>— Xu Jinqing</p>
<p>Ancient nursery rhymes often contained profound meanings that were incomprehensible at the time. However, sometimes the facts manifest themselves and have the wonder of "foreknowledge."</p>
<p>In the summer of this year, in Ningbo society, someone started to say that the enemy would scram in the autumn. When asked how they knew, they said that "at the latest" it would be at the time of "new rice fallen." The reason was that after Ningbo fell, the first "commissioner" was the traitor Shen Erqiao, the second was the traitor Tao Xiaojie, the third was the traitor Luo Mengxiang, and the last was the traitor Lu Maoyi. After the four traitors "New" (Shen), "Rice" (Tao), "Occupy" (Luo), and "Fall" (Lu), there would be no successors. Therefore, it was determined that "new rice fallen" was the "latest" time for the Japanese devils to scram. Because at that time, the chairman of the puppet Zhejiang Province was the traitor Ding Mocun, and the puppet county magistrate of Yin County was the traitor Yuan Duanfu, "Ding Yuan" was a homophone for "latest."</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, in early August, the Soviet Union declared war on Japan, and the United States used atomic bombs. Under the double pressure, the enemy army could not bear it and surrendered unconditionally. When the enemy troops withdrew from Yongcheng, it was the day of the new rice harvest, which was really an interesting coincidence.</p>

<h3>Celebrating a Happy New Year After Victory—Wishing Readers to Work Hard for "Social Service"</h3>
<p>Today, we are delighted to celebrate the first New Year after victory. After eight years of arduous war of resistance, everyone is having a happy New Year, and there is unspeakable joy in their hearts! Looking back, the people of the whole country, no matter where they were, north or south, no matter how old or young, who did not yearn for an early victory and to see the light again! Sure enough, final victory came, and we are delighted to celebrate a happy New Year. We can't help but shed tears of joy. The people of the whole country have today's glory and happiness. To state it clearly, the first thing we should do is thank the Supreme Leader, President Chiang, for his great achievements!</p>
<p>The New Year has arrived. We should examine our own responsibilities. For the society, the country, and the post-victory reconstruction, everyone must not easily abandon their responsibilities in any aspect. From now on, we must first ask ourselves, what kind of people will we be? Can we still follow the old ways, be complacent, have a declining will, outdated thinking, dissolute behavior, speculate and take advantage, and harm others to benefit ourselves? No! We must never retain the breath of inferior races. Everyone must be a first-class great citizen who is self-reliant, vigorous, diligent, cautious, loyal, and courageous. Everyone must serve the country and serve the society in everything. Only then can our country be revived and become rich and strong! Doesn't President Chiang say it very clearly in his book "China's Destiny"? Life is for "service." May all compatriots in the country do their best!</p>
<h3>Ensure Safe Navigation—Please Pay Attention to the Navigation Authorities</h3>
<p>After our country's coast was occupied by the enemy army, they buried mines and other explosives. During the occupation period, I don't know how many ships have been sunk by mines. In May of this year, the Huatai Wheel, traveling between Shanghai and Ningbo, sank after hitting a mine in the Tongsha waters outside Wusongkou, resulting in thousands of lives lost. Since the arrival of victory, the relevant authorities have begun mine-sweeping work, but the effectiveness of the work is not known to ordinary citizens. This time, the Hua Sheng Wheel, coming to Shanghai from Fujian, again hit a mine and crashed at the above-mentioned location, causing considerable loss of life and property. Who is responsible for this? Yesterday's newspaper also reported that a British ship encountered danger in the Sheshan waters. It is reported that other ships have also suffered the same fate. Therefore, we respectfully request that the navigation authorities and relevant agencies discuss and carry out large-scale mine-sweeping work in the short term, in order to completely eliminate mines and ensure safe navigation.</p>

<h3>Prospects for the Cultural Movement</h3>
<p>— Zhang Daofan</p>
<p>Written for New Year's Day of the 35th year of the Republic of China</p>
<p>The essence of culture is upwardness and freedom, which is what Hegel called "seeking a higher liberation." This liberation includes the individual's soul seeking upwardness and the nation's spirit seeking freedom. Its process is a movement. Since the Reform Movement of the late Qing Dynasty, there have been many routes for cultural movements in our country, and the pace has also been chaotic. At that time, we failed to choose and absorb foreign cultures well, and international political aggression shook our inherent fine national virtues. In the past hundred years of the late Qing Dynasty, "the country and the nation in politics, economy, society, ethics, and psychology, all suffered from declining customs, internal crises, and almost destroyed the foundation of our regeneration and blocked the source of our revival" (quoted from President Chiang). If it were not for the National Father adapting to the trends of the world on one hand and inheriting historical traditions on the other, the cultural movement of the Three Principles of the People, Chinese culture today would not have regained its upward path.</p>
<p>The process of a cultural movement should include two stages: cultural struggle and cultural construction. The cultural movement of the Three Principles of the People has already completed its mission of struggle in the process of the National Revolution. The task for the future should be to move forward on the path of active construction, with the ultimate goal of completing the five major constructions of psychology, ethics, society, politics, and economy.</p>
<p>The outline of the cultural movement promulgated by the Central Government in the winter of the 32nd year of the Republic of China briefly put forward the principles of the five major constructions. In terms of psychological construction, we must "establish a revolutionary worldview, reform the Chinese people's attitude of living in the moment, coldness, and selfishness, and be able to raise the spirit of initiative, establish self-confidence, and practice revolution." In terms of ethical construction, we must "improve the people's behavior, restore the nation's inherent morality, and promote it, cultivate the national character of nobility and soundness, so that our 450 million compatriots can all sacrifice the small self, benefit others, be loyal to the country, be filial to the nation, value integrity, love the people, and help each other peacefully." In terms of social construction, we must "enable the lives and actions of all members of society to follow certain rules, and enable all basic undertakings related to the people's welfare to be built in an orderly manner." In terms of political construction, we must "strengthen the ability to exercise the four powers based on the spirit of initiating the national autonomy and promote the realization of national politics." In terms of economic construction, we must "fill up national defense and enrich people's livelihood, with the aim that people do their best, land does its best, things do their best, and goods flow smoothly."</p>
<p>These five major constructions are actually the foundation of nation-building. In this short article, we cannot elaborate on them. What we want to say today is how the direction of the cultural movement in the future should be coordinated with the principles of these five major constructions. Regarding this point, President Chiang gave us clear instructions in his victory broadcast on the National Day of the 34th year of the Republic of China. He said that the direction of cultural construction after the war is to promote scientific research, guarantee academic freedom, and shift social customs. Please discuss it.</p>
<p>Nation-building work needs talent in everything, and needs technology in everything. Our China lags behind in everything, and science is even more so. The current world has entered the era of atomic energy, but the development of our industry has not yet entered the mechanical age, which is really lagging behind. In the future, we must catch up on one hand, and correct the tendency of neglecting the development of science in China in recent years on the other hand; that is, emphasizing applied science and neglecting pure science. From the perspective of academics themselves, this is neglecting the fundamentals and pursuing the branches. From the perspective of practical technology, it is also reversing the importance. Because practical science relies on deep academic theory as a foundation. Now that our country is a scientifically backward country, and there is such an unhealthy trend, we should be especially vigilant. In his instructions on the direction of cultural construction after the war, President Chiang has already clearly stated that pure science should be given the same importance as applied science.</p>
<p>However, the research of profound academics relies on the national education policy and political system to respect the development of people's individuality, and more relies on the legal guarantee of academic freedom, so that academic research can grow freely and flourish.</p>
<p>The great cause of nation-building has a myriad of details, but there is one fundamental thing, which is to practice realistic talent. In recent years, our social atmosphere has been too bad. There are indeed many people who are loyal to the country and the nation, but the general social customs are cold and selfish, competing and fighting. The direction of our future cultural construction efforts should be to transform the social atmosphere. There are a few old sayings in China, "The virtue of a gentleman is like the wind, the virtue of a villain is like the grass, and the wind on the grass must fall." The so-called wind here is a kind of atmosphere. If our social atmosphere can be shifted to diligence, honesty, and compliance with the law, then the past ailments of inertia, laziness, hypocrisy, and extravagance can be eradicated. This is a very difficult task, but it is also the most basic task. We often hear that the social commentary on the failure of something is that human planning is not destroyed. If we make a deeper observation, we will find that behind this person lurks a bad social atmosphere. Now that nation-building is starting, we must first transform the social atmosphere.</p>
<p>As the saying goes, "Those who travel a hundred miles are halfway at ninety." Although our eight years of arduous war of resistance have ended in victory, there are still many hardships ahead for nation-building. The struggle mission of the cultural movement has been completed, but the work of cultural construction is more complex and heavy. At the beginning of the year, I would like to express my views and share them with the cultural figures of our country.</p>
<h3>The Rebirth of Christianity and Chinese Culture</h3>
<p>— Ye Qiuyuan</p>
<p>The first day of the 35th year of the Republic of China is the first joyful New Year after the victory of the War of Resistance. This is the year when active nation-building begins. The departments included in the work of nation-building are originally broad; however, the most important and fundamental is cultural construction or spiritual construction. In terms of material construction, we may build 14,000 kilometers of railways and 1,500,000 kilometers of highways in the future, and have 14,417,400 merchant ships and 10,000,000 yarn spindles. However, if these material constructions are not accompanied by cultural construction or spiritual construction, it may lead to bad consequences. Therefore, Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, in "China's Destiny," when discussing the focus of nation-building work, first discussed psychological construction and ethical construction; these are all parts of cultural construction or spiritual construction. From the historical facts of nation-building, we see two examples that can serve as our model for nation-building. The first is Japan, and the second is the Soviet Union. After the Meiji Restoration, Japan actively engaged in nation-building, transplanting almost all of Western material civilization; thus, it was able to become increasingly rich and powerful. However, in the process of its nation-building, it neglected cultural or spiritual construction, and failed to simultaneously adopt the core of Western spiritual civilization, so that sixty years of arduous nation-building work was destroyed in an instant. As for the Soviet Union, it took socialism as its highest ideal for nation-building, so during the consecutive five-year plans for material construction, it devoted itself to the work of socialist cultural construction. The outcome of this remains to be seen in the future; but in any case, its ability to pay attention to both material and cultural construction at the same time is worthy of our reference. China takes the Three Principles of the People as its highest aspiration for nation-building, emphasizing both material and spiritual development; this has been repeatedly proclaimed by our Founding Father Sun Yat-sen and Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, and has long been regarded as a guiding principle. Now, at the beginning of the year of active nation-building, I would like to offer a perspective on the rebirth of our country's culture.</p>
<p>Speaking of our country's culture, including our thoughts, behaviors, habits, as well as daily life, clothing, food, and so on, it originally contains a large number of foreign elements, not just things of our own. It goes without saying that we live in Western-style houses and ride in cars, but even in ordinary things, we have accepted foreign things everywhere. Our "national music," such as the pipa and huqin, originally came from the Western Regions, not our authentic "national music." Our "national medicine" hangs a plaque of merit that says "Hua Tuo Reborn," but whether this Hua Tuo was an authentic Chinese is also a question. Our old ladies in the countryside, when seeing tragic things, burst out and shout "Amitabha"; this "Amitabha" is also not something we originally had; people in Confucius's time would not have shouted this. Even our "national costume" of a blue robe and black mandarin jacket is not our own costume, but the clothing of the Manchurian barbarians. Instances like these show that our country's culture contains many foreign elements. Perhaps it is not an overstatement to say that the times when China's interaction with foreign countries was frequent and its contact with foreign cultures was particularly abundant were also the most brilliant periods in the history of Chinese culture, such as the Tang, Song, and late Ming and early Qing dynasties. If Chinese culture has a characteristic, that characteristic lies in its ability to absorb foreign cultures.</p>
<p>China's initial contact with the West was guided by religion. The Nestorianism of the Tang Dynasty—a branch of Christianity—although not from Western Europe, already came from the Roman world in the Mediterranean, and its written language was mainly Syriac. During the Yuan Dynasty, the Roman Pope sent Franciscan friars to China to preach, which was the earliest record of our country's contact with Western Europe. Later, from the Ming and Qing dynasties to modern times, China's contact with Western Europe became increasingly frequent. Large numbers of students went to Europe and America, and European and American businessmen came to China one after another, causing changes in the lives of Chinese cities and Chinese people. The call for "industrialization" and "scientification" gave China's traditional life and culture the outward appearance of Western modern material civilization. However, Western spiritual life, that is, the religious life of Western Europe, was neglected. We see Western material civilization, but often do not pay attention to Western spiritual civilization. Some people even think that we ourselves have a high degree of spiritual civilization and disdain to pay attention to Western spiritual civilization. The result is that those who study abroad live in Western-style houses, ride in cars, and take concubines, even to the point of engaging in corruption and bribery, neither adhering to China's inherent propriety, justice, integrity, and sense of shame, nor understanding Western spiritual values, resulting in the loss of moral principles. Therefore, in the work of nation-building, ethical construction is the most fundamental.</p>
<p>Christianity is the foundation of Western European spiritual life. If Western Europeans have some virtues, the source of these virtues is not in the clarity of their politics, but in the fact that their lives are quietly influenced by Christianity. The clarity of politics is merely the result of the Christianization of their lives. In times of crisis, we often see British and American leaders invoking God with a religious tone. Their lives and behaviors are subject to the double restraint of religion and morality, so that they can be orderly. These are all things we should learn from. We should absorb the strengths of Western material civilization, but we should also adopt the strengths of Western spiritual civilization. In adopting Western spiritual civilization, we should adopt Christianity. Nation-building accompanied by "industrialization" must have nation-building accompanied by "Christianization." The rebirth of Chinese culture lies in how to absorb the essence of Christianity and blend it with our country's traditional culture, thereby promoting a new cultural movement. In our country's traditional culture, we must add some new blood, and this new blood is Christianity. Our country's inherent morals are all Christian morals. These moral ideals have been abandoned in recent years and need to be nurtured with the new blood of Christianity to grow.</p>
<p>Christianity seems to be something undigested in our country's culture. Although Xu Guangqi, Li Zhizao, and Yang Tingyun in the Ming Dynasty translated some books related to Christian faith, this work was later suspended due to the Qing court's management. In the past hundred years, Catholicism has mainly focused on penetrating into the people, so it has not devoted much effort to cultural activities; in the so-called anti-religious movement, even when establishing universities, it neglected the study of Chinese culture, so it has not had a profound impact on Chinese culture. Now that unequal treaties have been abolished, the spread of Christianity in China will become even more prosperous. If Christianity is to play a role in Chinese culture, it must first be accepted by the Chinese people; and to make it accepted by the Chinese people, it must first establish Christian literature. When Buddhism came to China, it played a role in Chinese culture by dedicating itself to the establishment of Buddhist literature. The number of Christian classics is countless, but few of these have been translated into Chinese; therefore, Christianity has not yet had an impact on Chinese literature and is not valued by the literati. In the future, Christianity must first establish Christian literature, and then the spread of Christianity in China can reach the general intellectual class. Our enlightened Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, in the midst of his busy schedule, still devotes himself to the revision of the Chinese translation of the Bible, in order to establish Christian literature for China. His intention is profound, and there is no need to say more.</p>
<p>From the standpoint of Christianity, Christianity has a mission to absorb the cultural traditions of various cultures, but it itself stands above the cultures of all nations. Therefore, Christianity is French culture in France, American culture in America, and Spanish culture in Spain. But Christianity itself contains the strengths of the cultural traditions of various nations. Christianity originated among the Hebrew people, and it naturally contains Hebrew traditions, and when it spread to the Greek and Roman world, it absorbed the traditions of the Greek and Roman world. The historical mission of harmonizing Greek tradition with Christianity was not completed until the 16th century by Thomas Aquinas. He Christianized the tradition of Aristotle. This is an important synthesis. When Christianity comes to China, it must be harmonized with Chinese tradition, and the core of Chinese tradition is Confucian thought. Christianity's position as a world religion lies in its ability to absorb and harmonize, so it must absorb and harmonize the Chinese Confucian tradition. This absorption and harmonization can bring Christianity into a new stage, and at the same time, it can give a new force to the Chinese Confucian movement. This harmonization will undoubtedly be a brilliant page in the history of Chinese culture. The rebirth of Chinese culture lies in this.</p>
<p>Looking at the world today, the division of cultures clearly presents three trends. On the one hand, we see the Soviet Union actively attempting to build its socialist culture. On the other hand, Western Europe, the Americas, Australia, and most of the world are Christian worlds. In addition, there are culturally backward nations. If we want to extricate ourselves from cultural backwardness, we must either take the road of socialism or the road of Christian civilization, and only this road is our road. When discussing psychological construction and ethical construction, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek repeatedly urged us to restore our inherent morality. The restoration and rebirth of morality in our country depend on the promotion of Christianity in China, Christianizing our old ethical concepts, so that a new force and a new atmosphere can be generated. We hope that the people of our country will pay more attention to the study of Christianity, and that Christianity itself will also pay more attention to the study of Chinese culture. Chinese culture will become more lively and brilliant by absorbing Christianity, and Christianity will become more enriched by absorbing and harmonizing Chinese tradition. Cultural construction, spiritual construction, are found in this.</p>
<h3>Democracy and the Rule of Law</h3>
<p>— Yang Youjiong</p>
<p>The current trend of world political thought is inevitably toward democratic politics; however, democratic politics must be based on the rule of law. The democratic politics of Britain and the United States, which are admired by the Chinese people today, have been able to be implemented for a long time because of more than a century of rule of law habits and traditions. The British political habit is that when Parliament expresses a vote of no confidence in the Cabinet, the Cabinet must resign or dissolve Parliament to seek public opinion to determine whether to stay or leave; the American party law stipulates that a presidential election is held every four years. These are the legal norms that the democratic politics of Britain and the United States follow. If the British Cabinet did not resign when Parliament expressed a vote of no confidence, or if the American president refused to step down and run for election after his four-year term expired, could the democratic politics of Britain and the United States have continued peacefully to this day? Therefore, we believe that talking about democracy must not be separated from the rule of law. To be honest, without the intention to maintain law and order and implement the rule of law, one must not extravagantly talk about democracy. This principle is very clear and does not need to be discussed in detail.</p>
<p>Constitutional implementation is not far away, but the Chinese people's concept of the rule of law has not been deeply cultivated, and law and order have not been firmly established. If right and wrong are not clearly distinguished, how can the people have a deep understanding of democratic politics? The basic spirit of the rule of law is to make political life dominated by reason. Reason is opposed to force, so all issues that may cause political disputes in the country cannot be resolved by force. We currently need to establish a kind of law and order, so that the government and the people have a common norm to follow. The nation-building procedures stipulated in the Outline of Nation-Building have been recognized by the whole country as the political norms on which constitutional and party politics are based. We should not seek other political solutions outside of this political norm. Therefore, we pay attention to the evolution of the current political situation. We hope that the government and all parties will not abandon law and order, and will not fail to follow the normal path of democratic constitutionalism due to temporary political disturbances, otherwise there will be concerns that the more one tries to straighten out the threads, the more tangled they become.</p>
<p>Convening the National Assembly is the only way to resolve the current situation, but the government has repeatedly postponed it in the past, and cannot show the people of the country the determination to establish the National Assembly as a normal path for building constitutionalism; some people even believe that convening the National Assembly will be the main cause of political disputes. If one really wants to abandon the National Assembly and put it aside, how will those political commentators who use the end of tutelage and the implementation of constitutionalism as an excuse for unrest achieve true democracy? We believe that the spirit of democratic politics lies in reason and sincerity, but it is definitely not a tool for political struggle. If democratic politics cannot be established on the basis of the rule of law, the political situation will only become more turbulent, and political struggles will never end. Here, we must remind the people of the country that they should recognize that democracy and the rule of law are two major conditions for the implementation of good governance.</p>
<p>We certainly cannot say that having a constitution means democratic politics, but in today's China, we do need a constitution supported by the people. More than 30 years have passed since the founding of the Republic of China, and we still do not have a fundamental law. If the fundamental law is not established, how can the norms of constitutional politics become more solid? Therefore, we advocate that the National Assembly should be convened as soon as possible to complete the constitution-making work, so as to lay the foundation for the rule of law. The Chinese people's habit of the rule of law is not deep. It is not enough to actively create norms for constitutional politics to maintain social order. Even the so-called people from various parties and factions should compete intellectually and politically in constitutional politics, and should not always focus on the struggle for real political power. We only hope that the upcoming Political Consultative Conference can achieve the level of "consultation," and must not allow it to change the procedures of constitutional politics due to the consultation of parties and factions. How closely the people of the country pay attention to this!</p>
<p>Since the establishment of the Republic of China, most of the disturbances that have occurred have been due to political struggles that do not follow legal procedures and use unscrupulous means. Political struggle in democratic countries is not an inauspicious term. Political struggle must be within the scope of law and order, otherwise, even if everyone advocates democracy, it will not help the implementation of democratic politics. Today's political theories are complex, and the threads seem to be complicated. In fact, when it comes to theory, we only hear simple democratic slogans. The term democratic politics includes a broad history, and its content often varies considerably with time and place, but in historical development, or from the trend of the system, democratic politics has a significant material, that is, each political party seeks the support of the people with its own propositions, as a prerequisite for obtaining political power. We hope that the so-called people from various parties and factions today will put forward their clear political platforms, solicit the public opinion of the people across the country, and strive for the support of the people on the legal track of the country, and only a selfless political proposition that meets the needs of the times can be believed by the people. Democratic politics can never be realized by relying on political talk, nor can it be established by dancing parties and cultivating relationships. These are all perfunctory and expedient, and how can they really plan for the country's long-term interests? The foundation of true democratic politics must be built on policies supported by the whole people. We advocate that people from various parties and factions should publicly put forward their political propositions at this time, and launch debates on policies, oppose any ambiguous political deals, and any secret political negotiations. Only through debates on policies can the truth of democratic politics be discovered, and only by winning the belief of the people with policies can there be hope of obtaining political power or continuing political power. Otherwise, it is not the demeanor of a democratic politician. We stand on a pure objective position and believe that only by following the established nation-building procedures of the country, implementing constitutional politics, and enduring eight years of suffering, can the people have a day of peace and happiness.</p>
<h3>Proposal to Establish a Special Agency for Engineering Management</h3>
<p>— Chen Ruxuan</p>
<p>With the victory of the War of Resistance, nation-building is becoming increasingly urgent. The central government has recently drafted a one-year construction plan. In accordance with the Industrial Plan personally drafted by the Founding Father Sun Yat-sen and the industrial construction indicated by Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, the focus of nation-building work in the future has been followed. In summary, the main points include the construction of railways and highways, the construction of coastal and inland river ports, the dredging of rivers, the improvement of Chen Tian water conservancy, the development of power, the installation of telecommunications, the construction of public housing and mining factories, the installation of urban tap water and sewers, as well as the construction of national defense fortresses and airports, all of which belong to the scope of public works.</p>
<p>Public works have a guiding and driving role in economic construction. At the beginning of material construction in advanced countries, they almost all used them to establish the foundation of industrial construction. Especially during periods of economic panic, they often used the holding of public works as an important strategy to solve the problem of unemployment. The reason is that public works can employ a large number of workers and solve their livelihoods; they can increase the demand for tools and raw materials and stimulate their production. In 1933, when the economic panic wave was surging, US President Roosevelt implemented the "New Deal," and held flood control, reclamation, municipal electrification, and other projects, which were mainly based on public works, and finally safely overcame the difficulties, enriched national strength, and achieved remarkable results, which can be clearly demonstrated. After the completion of public works, they develop resources, promote production, facilitate the transportation of goods, the circulation of finance, improve the lives of the masses, and make the society prosperous. Their merits are long-lasting and benefit the people's livelihood, which is even more unnecessary to mention.</p>
<p>At present, China's social economy is in a period of turmoil. The war against Japan ended not long ago, but the industry in the rear area feels unable to support itself due to the sluggish sales of products and the tight money supply, and there is a sense of impending doom. Shutdowns and layoffs are occurring from time to time, and calls for relief are heard everywhere. The government has no choice but to issue industrial loans and implement subsidies to barely save the immediate emergency, but it is not a fundamental solution. At the same time, after the military ends, veterans are demobilized, and when demobilization is implemented, a large number of surplus officers and soldiers will need to be properly settled. In addition, the original military engineering projects have been stopped, and most of the technical employees must change their jobs, and it is not convenient to let them idle. The original organization and tools and materials should be used. All these circumstances are obvious. As the saying goes, "The stones of other mountains can be used to polish jade." The precedents of the Allied countries can be used as a reference. It is undoubtedly necessary to quickly launch various public works according to the plan, so as to settle personnel, stimulate production, and solve the current urgent social and economic problems.</p>
<p>According to this scope, the special engineering management agency will not have the problem of unclear division of labor with the original administrative agency, and can accelerate the progress of its business. It will be able to promote the construction plan to its full advantage, and the future of nation-building will be promising.</p>
<p>Public works are the basic work of nation-building, and are especially the current priority. Since they are as described above, the agency in charge of this project has a great impact on the effectiveness of the implementation, and it is necessary to review it. Now, according to past experience, I will briefly discuss the Chinese and foreign systems.</p>
<p>The progress of public works must be rapid and economical, and attention must be paid to the proper allocation of manpower and materials. When the project is in progress, a large amount of manpower and materials are needed to actively catch up, and after the project is completed, this manpower and materials do not need to be kept for a long time, and should be transferred to other new projects, so that people are not idle and materials are used to their full potential. Therefore, the engineering agency in charge should have a special agency, so that it can plan and coordinate as a whole. This is the first point.</p>
<p>The holding of public works requires a large number of technical personnel. These personnel must be reserved and organized in advance, so as to avoid temporary gathering and wasting time and effort. There are not many engineering specialists in China at present, and the tools and instruments that can be used are limited. Special effort should be made to concentrate strength, improve the organization, and unify command, so as to go to work. This is the second point.</p>
<p>The nature of engineering construction is different from that of administrative management. During the construction period of public works, the emphasis is on technology, and the need for engineering specialists is greater. After the completion of public works, it becomes a public enterprise, and the management and operation require more administrative talents. The situation is different from that during construction. In order to make proper use of the two and each fulfill their responsibilities, engineering and management should be separately managed, and should not be managed concurrently. This is the third point.</p>

<h3>A Prospectus for New Shanghai's Cultural Development</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>With the victory of the War of Resistance and the return of the concessions, the new Shanghai Municipal Government, since its establishment, has faced a multitude of issues to address. The greatest objective is to build a new Shanghai. We observe that while the various measures taken in the past concessions created Shanghai's prosperity, they neglected cultural endeavors. The most notable aspect was perhaps the Municipal Council's band. Initially, it primarily catered to Western audiences, but later Chinese people joined. Besides this, there were only the library and a few schools dedicated to training comprador talents in translation. The former Mayor Wu Tiecheng expressed his regret regarding this situation. During his tenure, Mayor Wu constructed a gymnasium, a library, and a museum in the city center, representing the preliminary achievements of Shanghai's cultural development. Unfortunately, these were all destroyed during the war. Now that the municipal authorities aim to establish a new Shanghai, they naturally recognize the importance of cultural development and are determined to actively pursue it. Regarding the restoration of the library, the former Municipal Council's library has already been acquired, temporarily sufficient to meet needs. Concerning [gymnasiums/sports venues], various venues within the former concessions can be utilized to supplement needs, so excessive considerations are unnecessary at this time. Recently, we heard that the municipal authorities are planning to establish a scientific research institute, which is excellent news, and we would like to express gratitude on behalf of young people dedicated to scientific research. However, there has been no news about the restoration of the museum. In the past, the museum's reputation exceeded its physical structure and the scale of its displays, which seemed disproportionate. During periods of local prosperity, undertaking such a venture still fell short of ideal standards. How much more challenging is it now, after a major war, when vitality has not yet recovered? Since restoring the museum may be difficult in the short term, I humbly suggest revising the approach, scaling down the scope, and establishing an art museum. This might be easier to implement. When funding becomes more abundant in the future, restoring the museum separately would also be acceptable. Once the scientific research institute is established, the art museum should follow suit, as the promotion of science and art should proceed in parallel.</p>
<p>Science and art are the two wings of modern civilization. Science is the driving force behind material construction, while art is the driving force behind the improvement of life. A country aiming to build modern civilization cannot lack either of these elements. (Here, we must especially commemorate the late Mr. Chiang Pai-li, who had the most profound understanding of this issue.) Placing exclusive emphasis on science while neglecting art is a biased and inadequate perspective. Indeed, after the victory of the War of Resistance, our urgent task is national reconstruction. Our national reconstruction involves not only demanding a democratic political system but also, and primarily, material construction. To complete the country's material construction, we need science and scientists. We have heard that the National Government already has considerable plans for the construction of a new China, preparing comprehensive steps to implement them in phases. The scale of this endeavor is certainly grand. However, our scientific talent is woefully inadequate. How the government should broadly plan to cultivate various kinds of scientific talent is a topic I will not delve into here. Judging from the situation in Shanghai, the scientific literacy of the people of Shanghai is slightly higher than in other places, and the tools and equipment for various research endeavors are also superior to those in other places. Currently, it is imperative to utilize Shanghai's foundation and intensify cultivation. That the municipal authorities can attend to the establishment of a scientific research institute amidst numerous pressing matters demonstrates their ability to see the bigger picture and grasp the fundamentals. Now that there is a plan in place, we hope that it will be implemented as soon as possible. Not only that, but we also hope that it will be gradually expanded, from one institute to ten, and from ten to a hundred, and that it will progress from general to specialized fields. It should not only be available to teachers and students in schools but also provide ample opportunities for researchers outside of schools to utilize it. I believe that if we unite schools, factories, and organizations to work together, achieving this aspiration is not impossible.</p>
<p>Regarding the construction of an art museum, it may currently be viewed as a municipal embellishment that can be postponed. Little do people know that while Shanghai has been dubbed a cultural center in the past, it has also long faced accusations of neglecting cultural development from another perspective. At this juncture of municipal renewal, there must be a new turn to refresh perceptions. Art has the most significant and effective impact on guiding and elevating human thought and life. From the perspective of artistic creation, it unleashes humanity's creative will and capacity. From the perspective of artistic appreciation, it inspires humanity's upward aspirations and empathy. The cultivation of art can elevate human life to the purest, most excellent, and most sublime realm, which cannot be compared to moral instruction or legal constraints. Mr. Cai Yuanpei said that aesthetic education can replace religion, which is truly the insightful observation of a great scholar, worthy of thorough consideration by educators and cultural figures today. In terms of the most immediate situation, clean and orderly environments are invariably cultivated from the cultivation of the idea of beauty. All cold, selfish, base, and degenerated tendencies are also naturally eliminated by the expansion of an appreciation for beauty. As for all industrial and craft production, they will naturally compete and progress due to the increased opportunities for observation, which benefits commercial and industrial development – this benefit is self-evident.</p>
<p>The promotion of art should be accelerated. Therefore, it is hoped that the municipal authorities will prepare to establish an art museum after the scientific research institute is established. In the initial stages, it is not necessary to strive for comprehensive facilities. It is sufficient to construct suitable buildings with adequate capacity to display three sections: Chinese painting, sculpture, and applied arts. Then, gradually expand to include Western-style paintings and sculptures created by Chinese artists. As the name suggests, the exhibits in the art museum should primarily focus on visual arts. The general approach in the past was to neglect the essential elements and seek only a wide variety of items, resulting in a complex and disordered display that overshadowed the main purpose. This situation must be rectified. If sufficient funding is temporarily unavailable to acquire exhibits, one may temporarily consider borrowing from private collections and rotating them periodically. According to my personal knowledge, there are many valuable works of art among the enemy and puppet properties in Shanghai. I wonder how the responsible authorities will handle them? If a thorough investigation is conducted and the municipal government manages to acquire them as the foundation for the municipal art museum, this would be ideal. At the same time, to subsidize the running costs, a portion of the museum could be designated for rental to various exhibitions, charging reasonable fees, which would be greatly welcomed in the art community.</p>
<p>We are aware that the current municipal expenses are extravagant, and the authorities are currently trying to tighten their belts. The establishment of the scientific research institute is already a rare achievement, let alone hoping for more such institutes, and even more so hoping to establish an art museum? However, cultural undertakings are related to the grand strategy of building the nation. Parents in families are even willing to tighten their belts and work hard to maintain their children's educational expenses. Leaders of the government should also have the heart of virtuous parents and, while saving and eliminating expenses in other areas, should not only avoid cutting back on cultural undertakings but also expand them to the greatest possible extent. It is hoped that in this year—the thirty-fifth year of the Republic of China—three or more municipal scientific research institutes and one municipal art museum can be established in Shanghai. "The plan for the year lies in the spring, and the plan for the day lies in the morning." On this New Year's Day, I humbly offer this small suggestion, hoping that the municipal authorities will pay attention to it.</p>

<h3>The Full Picture of Shanghai's Municipal Administration</h3>
<p>—Special Report from Our Newspaper's Interview Team—</p>
<p>The city of Shanghai has endured the flames of war and been ravaged in countless ways by puppets. For eight years, municipal facilities have been largely at a standstill. Today, with the initial arrival of victory, the municipal government is faced with a daunting task involving a myriad of details, all of which require proactive adjustment. To understand the progress of the city's municipal administration over the past three months, our newspaper dispatched its entire interview team to visit the municipal government and its various bureaus and departments. Our goal was to gather real-world data and provide citizens with a systematic report.</p>
<p>The main questions we posed were: (1) Since taking over, what have been the most significant achievements of the Shanghai Municipal Government and its various bureaus and departments in terms of the city's administration and construction? (2) What are the main obstacles facing municipal administration in the past three months? (3) What is the central plan for building a great new Shanghai? (4) How efficient are the work of the municipal government and its various bureaus and departments? What is the spirit of promotion?</p>
<p>Summarizing our reports, we have obtained the following answers: (1) Under the leadership of Mayor Qian, although the various units of the municipal government have faced significant environmental obstacles and numerous work difficulties in the past three months, they have made great achievements in rectifying past malpractices and promoting the city's overall development. However, citizens have had limited opportunities to interact with the municipal government, and therefore, the general public remains largely uninformed about its operations. (2) The biggest difficulty currently facing the municipal government is the financial shortfall. All administrative and construction projects require substantial funding. With the current financial instability, many projects cannot be actively promoted. (3) Due to time and financial constraints, the overall plan for building a new Shanghai is still in the throes of difficult birth. Based on current observations, in the short term, the municipal government can only focus on restoring facilities destroyed by the enemy and puppets, with little capacity to advance the grand plan of building a new Shanghai. (4) The administrative leaders of this city, from the mayor down, are among the most respected professionals in the country. The caliber of the bureau directors is unmatched by any other city in the country. However, the organization of each bureau is currently not tight enough. Therefore, if the efficiency of work is assessed based on the number of staff, it still does not meet the ideal level, and the procedures for handling affairs are still not as streamlined as they should be.</p>
<p>According to the various reports collected by this newspaper, the most important issues currently facing the municipal government are: (1) Establishing a solid financial foundation to ensure not only a balanced budget but also sufficient economic strength to promote various administrative and construction plans. All municipal facilities in the city, such as expanding education, establishing various social welfare programs, building new roads and docks, building affordable housing, promoting public health, and strengthening police force, rely on economic driving forces. Therefore, the most pressing preliminary issue is centered on the "money" factor. (2) Promoting municipal construction requires a comprehensive plan, formulating a five-year or ten-year construction plan for the entire city to ensure the balanced and reasonable development of various projects. Based on our observations, the municipal government should, in the short term, consult with city leaders to carefully study the overall construction outline, so that Shanghai's construction can be implemented step by step based on a "blueprint" as soon as possible. (3) On the one hand, the municipal government must actively cultivate the integrity of its general staff. At the same time, it is also necessary to gradually improve the treatment of staff within possible limits, so that the Shanghai Municipal Government can follow the examples of Britain and the United States to cultivate a general pool of healthy, specialized civil servants.</p>
<p>Municipal Government</p>
<p>Editor's Note: This article is Mayor Qian's New Year's Day essay, entitled "Shanghai's Municipal Administration After the Restoration," which is about 5,000 words long. It elaborates on future municipal facilities in ten major categories. Today, our newspaper is featuring a special report on the full picture of municipal administration, and Mayor Qian's article is perfect as the leading piece to provide an overall framework. However, since the manuscript is a bit long, the sections below B will be moved to page five for editorial reasons. The special report from our newspaper's interview team will follow immediately after section A. Readers' understanding is appreciated.</p>
<p>Today is the New Year's Day of the 35th year of the Republic of China, which is also the anniversary of the founding of the Republic of China. Since its establishment, our Republic has been full of sorrows and dangers. It was not until last year that we gained a position of freedom and equality, presenting a bright and splendid future. In addition, for eight years, our compatriots have been living in war and spending their New Year in the sound of artillery fire. It was not until this year that the hard times came to an end, and everyone celebrated peace and prosperity. This is truly something to celebrate.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the year, various newspapers publish articles. I think that instead of writing general platitudes, it would be better to selectively record the municipal facilities of the past three months. This can provide a basis for self-assessment and also help citizens understand the situation. Therefore, I wrote this article to replace discussions. However, municipal facilities are complex and involve countless details. Now, they are described in ten months, as follows:</p>
<p>A. Consolidating Public Security</p>
<p>Shanghai is an international city with a complex situation. After eight years of occupation by the enemy and puppets, bandits are rampant, traitors are everywhere, order is chaotic, and public security is worrisome. After taking office, I made restoring order and consolidating public security the top priority. The work can be described in two categories:</p>
<p>1. Purging traitors and preventing bandits. Since taking over, the city has been actively investigating the actions of traitors, collecting evidence, and conducting strict investigations. A total of 128 cases involving 573 people have been investigated and reported. To prevent bandits, in addition to strengthening police force, special household registration inspections, civilian gun registration, management of stations, docks, hotels, and other public and private places, and the arrest of scattered soldiers, vagrants, and hooligans are carried out to eliminate the source of bandits. Since taking over, 56 bandit cases involving 311 bandits have been solved. Currently, efforts are being concentrated on prevention and suppression in order to clear the situation.</p>
<p>2. Strengthening the police force and supplementing police preparedness. This is done from both quantitative and qualitative aspects. Quantitatively, the city has a vast area, and the existing police force is still insufficient. Active efforts are being made to supplement it to ensure it is sufficient. Qualitatively, the qualifications for candidates are raised and training is strengthened. Training education, new management education, and refresher education are all actively underway. To supplement police preparedness, vehicle patrols, horseback patrols, and motorcycle teams are organized to patrol different areas in coordination with various branches to ensure public security. At the same time, a security committee is organized to unite with all sectors of society and supplement the security corps to share the responsibility of protecting the local area.</p>
<p>Bureau of Finance</p>
<p>Director of Finance, Pu Zhengdong</p>
<p>After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the first measure taken by the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Finance was to abolish the consumption tax and gold tax illegally levied by the puppet regime. The revenue from these two special taxes accounted for more than 70% of the city's total tax revenue each month. Suddenly losing it was indeed not easy to replenish. Therefore, the bureau turned to rectifying the accumulated malpractices in tax administration, eliminating embezzlement, and saving administrative expenses to replenish construction funds. The operation and work were extremely difficult. According to Shanghai's local taxes and levies, most of which are sporadic, such as the slaughter tax, entertainment tax, banquet tax, license tax, hotel tax, and property tax, the main local tax revenues during the enemy-puppet period, for example, from January to the end of August of the 34th year of the Republic of China, were converted into legal tender at a rate of 200 to 1. The average monthly tax revenue was 2,409,740 yuan for the slaughter tax, 15,434,500 yuan for the banquet tax, 5,427,493 yuan for the entertainment tax, 368,655 yuan for the license tax, 2,291,551 yuan for the hotel tax, and 971,124 yuan for the property tax, totaling 26,903,063 yuan. From September 24, when the Bureau of Finance started collecting taxes, to the end of November, the total tax revenue was 408,987,745 yuan, including 16,447,084 yuan in September, 113,626,274 yuan in October, and 278,806,387 yuan in November. It is estimated that the revenue for December will reach about 500,000,000 yuan, an increase of about 20 times compared to the monthly collection during the puppet regime. Calculating the collection amount by subject in recent months, the average monthly collection is 84,000,000 yuan for the slaughter tax, 100,000,000 yuan for the banquet tax, 74,000,000 yuan for the entertainment tax, 16,000,000 yuan for the license tax, and 25,000,000 yuan for the hotel tax, totaling 299,000,000 yuan. However, the property tax is still being re-evaluated and has not yet been collected, and the deed tax surcharge is also not included. In the near future, the total tax revenue is expected to increase to 700,000,000 yuan per month. In addition, among the various taxes collected by the central government, the percentage allocated to the municipal government is estimated to be 400,000,000 yuan for the business tax, 150,000,000 yuan for the land tax, 150,000,000 yuan for the stamp tax, 50,000,000 yuan for the inheritance tax, and 50,000,000 yuan for the property rental and sales income tax, totaling 800,000,000 yuan. Adding this to the local tax revenue, the total monthly tax revenue is 1,500,000,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Regarding the business tax, the city can collect about 800,000,000 yuan per month, which is collected by the central government, and the city can get 50% of it. In practice, the municipal government believes that it would be better if the tax revenue was directly collected by the city, because the local government is more familiar with the local situation and can easily collect taxes. Moreover, the tax can be collected by the city's tax collection office without setting up a separate agency, which can save expenses and may reach 1,000,000,000 yuan, exceeding the estimated number by 200,000,000 yuan. Then the city's administrative construction costs will be guaranteed, and there is no need for the central government to allocate other taxes, or even the surplus business tax of 200,000,000 yuan can be allocated to the central government.</p>
<p>As for the payment items, from the date of establishment of the Shanghai Municipal Government on September 12 of this year to the end of November, the total payments were 56,870,000 yuan in September, 1,079,650,000 yuan in October, and 1,378,430,000 yuan in November, totaling 2,414,950,000 yuan. Among them, excluding the start-up costs of 360,000,000 yuan and the police uniform costs of 1,495,000,000 yuan, the actual administrative expenses were 559,950,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Property and land donations were originally a stable source of revenue for the city, but currently, the city's rents are being re-evaluated and have not yet begun to be collected. According to the previous records, the total property and land donation income in the Shanghai city area in the 24th year of the Republic of China was 2,760,000 yuan, the total property and land donation income in the former French Concession in the 24th year of the Republic of China was 5,810,000 yuan, and the total property and land donation income in the former Public Concession in the 26th year of the Republic of China was 16,320,000 yuan. The total property and land donation income of the three old districts of Shanghai was 24,890,000 yuan. If calculated at 60 times, the current annual property and land donation income should be 1,000,000,000 yuan, and the average monthly property and land donation income should be 130,000,000 yuan.</p>
<p>As for the major implementations of the Bureau of Finance in the past three months, they are (1) defining the tax system, striving for standardization and unity, and starting anew with the people; (2) adjusting the collection agency, striving to save manpower and material resources; (3) simplifying collection procedures, eliminating embezzlement, and avoiding harassment; (4) implementing a public treasury system, starting from November 10, all tax and administrative fee revenues of the Shanghai Municipal Government and its affiliated agencies are directly collected and deposited into the treasury by city bank personnel stationed in each collection agency, and each collection agency is only responsible for collection.</p>
<p>In addition, a Municipal Public Property Management Committee, a Municipal Rent and Land Estimation Committee, and a Tax Review Committee have been established.</p>
<p>The Bureau of Finance received a list of more than 1,600 staff members from the puppet regime's bureau, which has been repeatedly reduced. Currently, there are only more than 300 people to save costs and increase efficiency. In order to prevent corruption, the bureau has also set up a secret report box to allow people to file complaints.</p>
<p>Director Pu Zhengdong, courtesy name Xinya, is from Wuxi, Jiangsu. He is 55 years old and has served in financial administration, as a news reporter, a university professor, a member of the Hankou City and Chongqing City Provisional Councils, the chairman of the Hankou Banking Association, the director of the loan department of the Four Joint Offices, the manager of the major controlled banks of the Bank of Communications in Shanghai, Hankou, Harbin, and Chongqing, and the general manager of the Chongqing Electric Power Company. He is currently the director of the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Finance, the chairman of the Shanghai City Bank, and a director or executive director of the Bank of Communications, the Chinese Farmers Bank, the Jiangsu Bank, the Hubei Bank, the Jiangsu Farmers Bank, the Minsheng Company, the Chongqing Electric Power Company, and the Pacific Insurance Company.</p>
<p>Bureau of Social Affairs</p>
<p>Acting Director of the Bureau of Social Affairs, Ge Kexin</p>
<p>Among the various bureaus under the Municipal Government, the Bureau of Social Affairs has a relatively wide range of policy objects. Whether in politics, economy, society, or culture, anything that promotes social harmony and progress is included.</p>
<p>Shanghai, after eight years of war, has had all its social organizations destroyed. Before the war, the production, transportation, distribution, and consumption processes of our national economy were organically linked, but now they are disconnected. The systematic social organizations of the past no longer exist. The consistent cultural traditions of the past are now confused. In the past, the city's houses were in excess, but now they are not enough. Therefore, social disputes are inevitable. The problem is not the number of disputes but how to reasonably adjust them to normalize them. Only when prices are stable and production is restored is it possible to reduce labor disputes. Only by reorganizing social organizations so that various groups can assist the restoration of the entire society under the leadership of the government can we talk about reform.</p>
<p>Today, the situation in Shanghai makes the tasks of the Bureau of Social Affairs so arduous. To rebuild what was destroyed by the enemy and puppets in the past eight years, to sort out the damages of the past eight years, to restore the connections between various sectors of society, and to maintain the harmony of all classes is like sorting out a pile of messy hair. It requires the patience and courage of the supervisors and staff, as well as careful and reasonable handling, to get it back on track from a broken and disjointed situation.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the restoration, the central government specially selected Wu Shaoshu and Ge Kexin to serve as the director and deputy director of the bureau. In a sick society full of thousands of details and ravaged sights, they carefully followed the established national policy and the instructions of the chairman, distinguishing between urgency and importance, and planning and reorganizing everything from scratch. So far, although it is still far from our ideals, the foundation for future work has been laid in this extremely short period of time, which cannot be ignored. After Wu resigned from his concurrent post as director due to heavy official duties last month, Deputy Director Ge is now temporarily acting as director. Ge is 41 years old, from Jiangsu, and a law student at Shanghai University. He has served as the secretary of the Political Department of the 33rd Army of the National Revolutionary Army, the chief secretary of the Hankou City Party Department, a member of the Hankou Municipal Government Council, a chief commentator of the Wuhan Daily, a specialist member of the Central Propaganda Department, a major general councilor of the Third War Zone Commander-in-Chief's Office, and an executive committee member and secretary-general of the Shanghai City Party Department.</p>
<p>Ge told reporters in a very amiable manner: "The policies of this bureau in the past three months have been obviously slow due to financial difficulties, limited manpower, and various other unavoidable obstacles. They are mostly of a transitional nature. The main ones can be divided into two aspects: (1) restoration and reorganization, (2) social stability."</p>
<p>Regarding the restoration and reorganization work, in addition to reorganizing and re-registering various old agricultural, industrial, commercial, social, cultural, and even charitable organizations, various regulations are being drafted to facilitate the establishment of groups or the progress of work. At the same time, in order to ensure that society quickly moves towards stability, various social works have been carried out, such as the mediation of labor disputes. This work is handled in accordance with the wage adjustment measures in the recovered areas. The determination of wages is based on the cost of living index. Therefore, labor disputes are resolved in the mediation stage, and no case needs to be resolved through arbitration. For example, the price control work and the organization of the evaluation committee aim to eliminate price fluctuations and assist various industry groups in procurement, so that production can be restored as soon as possible and people's livelihoods can be slightly improved. On the other hand, welfare undertakings are carried out, such as job registration, improvement of labor welfare undertakings, accommodation of refugees and orphans, restoration of public pawns, organization of civilian villages, and establishment of cooperative societies for municipal employees.</p>
<p>Then Ge told reporters about the planned work plan for the future. He said: "In addition to continuing to complete the unfinished work, we also plan to handle some newly created work." He casually flipped out a plan and handed it to reporters. It is divided into four categories: economic administration, social organization, labor administration, and social welfare. The following is an appendix:</p>
<p>Economic Administration</p>
<p>1.

Therefore, the criticism and cooperation of citizens is necessary and urgent.</p>
<p>Bureau of Public Works</p>
<p>Director of the Bureau of Public Works, Zhao Huijue</p>
<p>The so-called public utility undertakings are generally nothing more than land and water transportation, water, electricity, and gas. The prosperity of a modern city is closely related to the development of public utility undertakings. At the beginning of the city's restoration, the assets of various public utility undertakings were confused, the equipment was damaged, the supply of water and electricity was on the verge of collapse, and the means of transportation were scarce. Trams and buses were all overcrowded, and it was as difficult to take a ride as it was to climb to the sky. Special class vehicles did not have license plates, and water navigation was also mostly suspended. At night, the street lights were dim. All kinds of declining phenomena cannot be described in words. The Bureau of Public Works took the lead in organizing a committee to carry out the reception and rectification. Except for the China Water and Electricity Company, which was received by the Ministry of Economy, the remaining public utility undertakings were received by the committee, together with the original operators of each company. In terms of transportation, such as trams, buses, and ferries, after receiving them, they were handed over to the original operators before the war to continue operating. However, the authorities discussed and agreed on three principles: (1) the undertaking must not be interrupted in the slightest, (2) all assets should be carefully checked and listed, and no omission should be allowed. If there are any losses, compensation should be claimed from the enemy according to law. The assets newly added by the enemy should be received by the municipal government, (3) all staff of public utility undertakings, regardless of nationality, should enjoy the same treatment as their counterparts in terms of salary and must not be discriminated against. During this transition period, the city's public utility undertakings were able to avoid interruption. The most difficult thing was the serious coal shortage. The authorities invited well-known people in the coal and shipping industries to organize the Shanghai Temporary Fuel Supervision Committee to take over the Japanese Coal Federation and its affiliated coal mines and to control the distribution. They gave priority to supplying public utility undertakings, restricted coal consumption, and dredged sources. After two months of efforts, public utility undertakings were fortunately spared from interruption. This was the most difficult period. Later, the Shanghai Fuel Committee of the Ministry of Economy was established, and there was a dedicated agency for the matter, so it came to an end. Another issue was adjusting prices. The various public utility undertakings were affected by price fluctuations, and the difference between revenue and expenditure was too large, so prices had to be adjusted. The adjustment principles can be summarized into three items: (1) Strive for the unity of prices in the city and eliminate the unreasonable phenomenon of zoning pricing before the war, (2) On the one hand, consider the lightest burden on citizens, and on the other hand, consider the minimum cost of each undertaking, (3) Pay attention to the interests of small users and the needs of large industrial users.</p>
<p>In the past three months, the various public utility undertakings have been guided and reorganized by the Bureau of Public Works, and it seems that there is still progress. The more obvious ones are that the city's water and electricity consumption is currently unrestricted; the most important industrial electricity consumption has also been restored in part, and the gas is temporarily maintained. However, the Wusong Gas Plant is also actively preparing to start work, which can expand the supply range. In terms of land transportation, the tram has restored four lines and added two lines. The ring road in the Nanshi district of the bus has been opened to traffic on December 10, and other lines in the old city area are also planned to be restored in the short term. In terms of water transportation, the Pujiang ferry line has been expanded from two lines during the war to six lines. There were 35 private ferries before the war, and 26 have been restored. Others, such as the street lights in the old city area, have been increased to 3550, and the connection rate of telephones has increased from 65% to 72%. The coal used for power generation has been reduced from 3.8 pounds per degree to 3 pounds recently. All of these, based on current observations, are progressive phenomena. However, if Shanghai is to become a modern city, these achievements are not worth mentioning, and there are many more things to be developed and improved.</p>
<p>To understand the future plans of the Bureau of Public Works, the reporter specifically visited Director Zhao Huijue. Director Zhao is a native of the city and is 45 years old this year. He has a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering from Jiaotong University and a master's degree in electrical engineering from Harvard University in the United States. He has practiced in Britain and Germany for many years. After returning to China, he served as an associate professor and head of the department at Zhejiang University. Director of the Zhejiang Provincial Telephone Bureau and Chief Engineer. Director of the Zhejiang Electric Power Plant. Director of the Zhejiang Industrial Improvement Institute. Special Commissioner of the Ministry of Communications for Electricity Administration in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Fujian, and Jiangxi. Specialist member of the Resources Committee. Director and Counselor of the Postal and Telecommunications Department of the Ministry of Communications. Member of the Central Design Bureau. Director Zhao is tall and has thick eyebrows and big eyes, which makes people feel awe. However, when talking to him, he is amiable and approachable. Therefore, his subordinates said, "We are afraid of him and love him."</p>
<p>Director Zhao said that Shanghai's electrical future has yet to be developed. According to statistics, the average monthly electricity consumption per person in London is 180 degrees, while Shanghai currently has only four degrees. In the future, Shanghai's total power supply may require a capacity of one million kilowatts. In terms of telephones, Shanghai currently has an average of one telephone for every 90 people, while New York has one telephone for every four people. Therefore, it is hoped that all automatic telephones with six numbers will be adopted as soon as possible. The central government is planning to form a national electrical and telephone network, and the city will assist in promoting the early realization of this plan. Tap water and gas are the most convenient, hygienic, and clean water and fuel in the city and should be promoted for use. This undertaking is purely local in nature, and the city should promote its joint management and development as much as possible. The exclusive labor contract of the British Shanghai Water Company will expire in 1947, and the French Shanghai Water Company will expire in 1950. It should be carefully decided whether the municipal government will handle it completely by itself or whether international joint investment will be made at that time. In terms of transportation, the city's original transportation lines are not only insufficient, but also have a bias towards east-west traffic, while north-south lines are very lacking. In order to promote urban development, it is necessary to form a Sino-foreign joint venture transportation company. The company will operate trams, buses, and ferries in a combined manner. The number of Pujiang ferries should be increased as soon as possible, so that the Pudong area will also have great hope for development. The above may be implemented one by one in the near future. I hope that the four million citizens will do their best to make Shanghai a perfect modern city. (Continued on page 3)</p>

<p>Bureau of Education</p>
<p>Director of the Bureau of Education, Gu Yuxiu</p>
<p>Chairman Jiang once announced to the whole country: "Military affairs should be the first during the war, and education should be the first after the war." Indeed, it takes ten years to cultivate people and a hundred years to cultivate trees. The rise and fall of education is related to the future of the entire nation. Shanghai has a dense population and is a cultural center. The government attaches special importance to it and appointed Gu Yuxiu as the director of the Municipal Bureau of Education. Gu once served as the permanent vice minister of the Ministry of Education, the president of the Central University, and has the demeanor of a scholar, simple and solemn. After taking office, he actively reorganized municipal private middle and primary schools, improved the treatment of teachers and staff, enriched library instruments and equipment, and has a complete plan for the future improvement of education in the city. The following is a detailed description:</p>
<p>Number of schools: The city currently has 13 municipal middle schools, 109 primary schools, 2 attached kindergartens, 226 private middle schools, 594 primary schools, 185 attached kindergartens, 3 Western schools, and 2 municipal Xinlu normal schools and vocational schools. In total, there are 1,154 schools. Given the large population of Shanghai, this number is obviously insufficient, especially primary schools.</p>
<p>Number of students: Municipal middle schools: 5,067 students, private middle schools 53,547 students, totaling 58,614 students, municipal primary schools 35,413 students, private primary schools 133,396 students totaling 168,809 students, municipal kindergartens 1,454 students, private kindergartens 7,220 students, totaling 8,674 students, Western middle schools 3 schools and attached primary schools 2 schools kindergartens 3 schools total students 693 people Xinlu Normal 206 people Above the total number of students reached 236,996 people, accounting for about 5% of the city's population. In other words, only one in twenty Shanghai citizens is receiving primary and secondary education. If calculated on the basis of one student per family, this number should be at least doubled, that is, the number of students should be about 15% of the total population of the city to be reasonable. There is no doubt that there are twice as many school-age children who are out of school. What is the impact of this on the future of the country and society?</p>
<p>In addition, the number of municipal schools is obviously insufficient, which makes students have to go to private schools with poorer facilities. In particular, there are only 13 municipal middle schools, while there are 226 private middle schools, which is a ratio of about 17 to 1. The ratio of students is 10 to 1. The Education Bureau is limited by funds and feels that it is difficult to maintain the existing schools, and it will inevitably be unable to create new schools. Excellent and poor students are waiting to be fed. If there is no subsidy such as scholarships, the number of students out of school will inevitably increase.</p>
<p>The treatment of teachers and staff in municipal primary and secondary schools was unspeakable during the puppet government era. It has now been gradually adjusted to the same treatment as civil servants, that is, calculated at 80 times the base salary plus a living allowance of 28,000 yuan. The salary standard is up to 520 yuan (president of the specialty school) and a minimum of 60 yuan (primary school staff). Assuming that an ordinary middle school teacher is paid 250 yuan, he can get a salary of 20,000 yuan and an allowance of 28,000 yuan. An ordinary primary school teacher with a base salary of 200 yuan can get a salary of 16,000 yuan and an allowance of 28,000 yuan. The salary standard for teachers and staff in people's schools is the same as that of primary schools. As mentioned above, teachers with simple families are able to make ends meet.</p>
<p>The Municipal Education Bureau is now divided into sixteen education districts throughout the city, which separately supervise education matters. Special attention is paid to the average distribution of schools in the region to avoid being too sparse or too dense in order to reduce the labor of students' trekking. It is also training principals of national schools and holding workshops for primary school teachers so that they can all be competent and happy. It is setting up academic lectures to facilitate the public's further education. It is setting up a municipal science experiment institute in Yucai Middle School so that students from schools with incomplete equipment can go to the experiment in shifts. There will be great help in academic studies. Physical education is also quite emphasized. It currently manages the city center sports field, Ximen Sports Field, and the City Gymnasium, and initiates various competitions at any time to enhance the physique of citizens.</p>
<p>In terms of bureau affairs management, there are: 1. The Secondary Education Office is responsible for the administration of municipal private middle schools, 2. The National Education Office is responsible for the affairs of municipal private primary schools. In the future, it may be planned to implement compulsory education, 3. The Vocational Education Office manages various vocational schools and tutoring schools, and has established one Shanghai Municipal College and one Shanghai Municipal Tutoring School, 4. The main work of the Social Education Office is to promote literacy campaigns and handle libraries, museums, sports fields, lecture halls, and other affairs. Now, it has set up three centers for music, work, and fine arts to actively promote social education, 5. The Inspectorate inspects and supervises the facilities of various schools in the city in order to improve them in the future.</p>
<p>Director Gu pays close attention to the further education of the internal staff of the bureau. He initiated the organization of the Municipal Education Bureau Colleagues' Further Education Association. Director Gu himself serves as the chairman. The internal departments are temporarily set up: (1) Reading Club, (2) Research Association. (3) Lecture Hall, colleagues from various departments can freely participate in the group meetings so that they have a full understanding and cultivation of the education system and other knowledge, so as to increase administrative efficiency. If the colleagues believe that the research results have important educational value, the bureau will award bonuses to encourage them. This approach can be followed by various places and agencies, which will definitely benefit the bureau's administration.</p>
<p>Finally, we hope that various undesirable situations in the city's education sector must be corrected. The existence of middle and primary schools in the alleys is a shame to the national education sector. In the future, after the city schools are widely established, private schools, except for those with outstanding reputation and excellent facilities, will inevitably be eliminated. However, at present, there is no doubt that this type of school still occupies the vast majority, and the quality of the students it cultivates is low and undeniable. The authorities should first conduct a thorough investigation, and those that are too simple should be ordered to stop running. Those that can be done should be strictly ordered to improve. The need to improve the quality of students should not be ignored at present. Since the occupation of the enemy and puppets, the quality of middle school students</p>
<h3>New Year's Message</h3>
<p>— Tang Enbo</p>
<p>The New Year's Day of the 35th year of the Republic of China is a glory emerging from suffering, it is gained from mortal combat, and it is so worthy of our joyful and encouraging commemoration and celebration. However, how to uphold the glory of victory and ensure the fruits of peace, this is the main topic of the 35th year of the Republic of China. At the beginning of the year, we must consider it cautiously, with the spirit of learning from past pain, and with a self-improving attitude, to lay the first cornerstone of national construction.</p>
<p>I believe that the prerequisite for national construction lies in the unity of the country, in that there is no room for division or rupture in government orders and military orders. This is how the Chinese people see it, and this is how the international community sees it. The ancient Chinese saying, "Concentrate your spirit and unify your actions," clearly reveals this universal principle. Chairman Chiang led us to establish the clear banner of the National Revolution from the military rule, and also fought for a bright future of freedom and peace from the ravages of powerful and brutal enemies. He himself stands on the responsibility of national salvation, representing the interests of the entire nation and people, and the people of the whole country also stand on the responsibility of national salvation, representing the interests of the entire nation and themselves. With consistent goals and consistent positions, this is how a great force is formed. It has a center of gravity and a direction, and it will never be shaken or damaged by the interests of a certain part or the personal desires of a certain individual. That is to say, under the mighty torrent of national resistance against Japan and unified national construction, no reactionary force can stop it. However, I hope that the people of the country will recall history for a moment. Who gave us the bloody stains of separatism and the people's suffering in history? -- Enemies and bandits. At the same time, we must also understand the reality. Who gave us the victorious glory of freedom, peace, joy, and happiness in reality? -- The leader and the nation. In this comparison, supporting a unified country and supporting a wise leader is as essential as our life and breath, and we must not leave it for a moment, and we must not be separated from it for a moment. At the beginning of the thirty-fifth year, I hope that the people of the country will first have this understanding and establish this proposition. We must unite our country under the wise leadership this year. Whoever opposes it, whoever destroys it, is our common enemy.</p>
<p>Secondly, the purpose of national construction lies in the stability of people's livelihoods. We should enable our compatriots in the occupied areas, who have been displaced and suffered without recourse for eight years, to find peace as soon as possible. However, we know that under the rule of the enemy, the burning, killing, raping, and looting of soldiers, the deception and fraud of bandits, and even the unscrupulous wealthy gentry, officials, and corrupt troops, are all plundering the people. Who can bear to hear about this dark and inhuman situation without shedding tears, and who can bear to see it without feeling sorrow? We have won, and the enemy's brutality will naturally no longer exist, but we must clear away the internal crises. I expressed my determination to stabilize public order and proposed the idea of ​​abolishing harsh taxes at the Jiangnan Public Security Conference. I will spare no effort to remove obstacles that endanger public order and harm people's livelihoods. However, the military aspect is only a tangible force. As the saying goes, "Wildfires cannot burn it out, and the spring breeze blows it back to life." For the effort to eradicate it, I hope that comrades in the Party and government, local leaders, and all the people will work together to complete this task. We can say that there is a stable people's livelihood only with a unified situation, and it can also be said that unity has a stronger foundation only with a stable people's livelihood. Therefore, I think that in the thirty-fifth year, we must devote ourselves to this. Whoever opposes it, whoever destroys it, is our common enemy.</p>
<p>The government is the public servant of the people, and the army is the armed force of the people. In the first year of victory, we are all determined to make this selfless and lofty plan. But we believe that this is indeed the foundation of national construction, and we must lay an unshakable foundation when laying the foundation.</p>
<p>I respectfully present my feelings as a New Year's message.</p>
<h3>How to Revive the Textile Industry</h3>
<p>— Pan Shihao</p>
<p>I. Should we focus on state-owned enterprises or emphasize both state-owned and private enterprises?</p>
<p>The textile industry is an important pillar of the light industry, which enriches the world. Before the war, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Japan relied on it to support their national power and developed it into a major export trade. After the war, the industry lost its normal track, but except for Japan, the advanced countries in the United Kingdom and the United States will be able to revitalize this industry to promote and enhance it, and it will continue to become the center of national power, which is beyond doubt. China has always been an industrially backward country, and the only thing that can be said to be commendable in the light industry is textiles. The government has recently divided the country into several cotton textile industrial zones to promote this matter. The attention to the cotton textile industry in these areas does not need our urging.</p>
<p>However, what should be noted first is whether the future cotton textile industry will focus on state-owned enterprises or private enterprises? In other words, will the government or the private sector be responsible for this important task of light industry? Before the war, this industry was not included in the list of state-owned enterprises, and general commentators only classified it as foreign merchants and Chinese merchants. After the war, British and American manufacturers were severely damaged. When victory came, the enemy and puppet factories were taken over and operated by the government. Then the state-owned part began to rise sharply. The government also established the China Textile Construction Corporation to manage it. In addition to the assets of the enemy and puppet textiles received by the Ministry of Economic Affairs for valuation, its capital was also increased by 1 billion national currency. The head office was set up in Shanghai, and branch offices, offices and factories may be set up in China and abroad when necessary. Its business scope is</p>
<p>A. Manufacture and dyeing of textiles,</p>
<p>B. Purchase and sale of textile and dyeing raw materials and finished products,</p>
<p>C. Manufacture and purchase and sale of textile and dyeing machines and parts,</p>
<p>D. Operation of businesses related to the first three items,</p>
<p>E. Investment in other businesses related to textile dyeing and finishing.</p>
<p>In terms of scale, it cannot be said to be small, but according to statistics, Shanghai, the center of my country's textile industry in terms of remittances, has equipment that can be listed as follows:</p>
<p>Spindles (pieces)　Thread spindles (pieces)　Looms (units)</p>
<p>Received factories　963,492　234,020　16,974</p>
<p>Private factories　1,636,788　109,982　30,441</p>
<p>Then the production capacity of private enterprises seems to be above that of state-owned enterprises. According to the spindles already in operation:</p>
<p>State-owned　193,285 pieces</p>
<p>Private　1,174,942 pieces</p>
<p>The number of looms already in operation is:</p>
<p>State-owned　3,871 units</p>
<p>Private　9,117 units</p>
<p>II. How should private manufacturers recover?</p>
<p>From the previous statement, the future textile industry should focus on private enterprises. However, how will private entrepreneurs prepare to undertake this important task? The improvement of technology, the renewal of equipment, and the appropriate management, for my own part, I am really unwilling to repeat old platitudes. However, the truth that contains the unchanging principles of the ages lies within the old platitudes, so how to earnestly promote and enhance this truth cannot be ignored.</p>
<p>Moreover, today's world transportation is becoming more and more convenient, and international relations are becoming closer and closer. It seems that tariff barriers, exchange restrictions, and artificial controls on imports and exports cannot be easily achieved. You can see this clearly from the International Monetary Agreement initiated by the United States. Therefore, how the textile industry will become the center of the production industry, and then become a tool for international trade, entrepreneurs should deeply reflect on themselves, have an awareness, focus on the international market, and adjust the steps of the industry, which are all urgent tasks. If they still take making a fortune for a company or a factory as the basis, and simply wait for the government to allocate enemy and puppet factories as a shortcut, then China's textile industry will never be able to rise.</p>
<p>However, from the perspective of the private sector, we should strive to make progress, and think for the government. If there is anything that can promote it, we should not be stingy and do it. Here, we have to solemnly raise a question, that is, we should urgently rescue the losses of forced purchase of yarn and cloth by the enemy and puppet regimes in order to restore its vitality. The assets of the cotton textile industry are: fixed assets, such as machinery and factory buildings, and current assets, such as raw materials and manufactured products. It relies on raw materials to operate. However, if you go to various cotton textile factories for an inspection, the raw materials and manufactured products they store are less than one-tenth of what they were before the war. Although they are now working hard to start work, the lack of raw materials and the shortage of manufactured products on the market are tragic. When asked, they said that the forced purchase of yarn and cloth by the enemy and puppet regimes in August of the 32nd year of the Republic of China had destroyed more than half of the vitality of the textile industry.</p>
<p>The deep foundation of the private textile industry and its efforts to start work should be valued by us. The development of the textile industry in advanced countries such as the United Kingdom and the United States has always been admired by our people, but we have never heard of it being supported by state-owned enterprises. According to the first phase of economic construction principles set by the Supreme National Defense Council, the operation of my country's economic construction industry must follow Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings to implement planned implementation, to develop a planned free economy, and gradually achieve the completion of the Three People's Principles economic system. As for the method of operation, private enterprises should be encouraged as much as possible. It has also been clearly stipulated that except for post offices, telecommunications, arsenals, mints, major railways, and large-scale hydropower plants, only those industries that private forces cannot overcome or that the government considers to be particularly important, such as large-scale oil fields, copper and iron plants, and aviation industries, may be operated by the government alone or jointly with private or foreign capital. Then the textile industry was not originally in the state-owned plan. Was the state-owned China Textile Construction Corporation a transition after the receipt of the enemy and puppet textile factories? According to the company's articles of association, it is stipulated that:</p>
<p>[The company's business term is limited to two years, and it may be extended for one year at a time if necessary]</p>
<p>It is clear that the government does not intend to permanently support my country's textile industry from a state-owned perspective. How can we not rejoice? Fortunately, we won the eight-year War of Resistance Against Japan. National economy and people's livelihood, hard work. Now is the time for the whole country to renovate and promote, and for officials and people to help each other. For all things that the private sector can reach and the public opinion wants, the government should stand in a fair position to promote its development. It is the government's fault to compete with the people for profit, and it is also something that should be done when there are many things waiting to be managed. It is hoped that the above-mentioned "transitional" period can be shortened as much as possible, and its production mechanism can be distributed to private enterprises in batches, so as to avoid the inconvenience of the co-existence of state-owned and private enterprises. Then can the focus of the textile industry be stabilized?</p>
<p>Anyone who pays attention to the government's actions at the time will not forget the scene of the forced purchase of yarn and cloth on August 9 of the 32nd year. At that time, the deadline was set from August 23 to September 6, and a total of 7,887 application forms were received, and the following were collected:</p>
<p>Cotton yarn 92,081 pieces 895 small packages 1,170 cones 224 pieces</p>
<p>White cloth 1,191,748.8 pieces 1,127,671.59 yards 164 sections 2,112.50 yards 1,000 kg</p>
<p>Processed cloth 4,856,447.74 pieces 6,651,423.97 yards 29,830 sections 120,267.25 yards 5,551.50 kg</p>
<p>In total, it should be 92,103 pieces of yarn and 6,440,880 pieces of cloth. This huge number is all the result of years of hard work by the textile industry and cotton cloth industry in Shanghai. At that time, it was swept away, and the blood and tears of the people are intertwined, and we can easily imagine the magnitude of the damage.</p>
<p>The puppet Chamber of Commerce also tried its best to preserve this yarn and cloth. As of the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the enemy and puppet regime surrendered, and the government sent personnel to take over. It was reported that there were still more than 10,000 pieces of yarn and more than 3 million pieces of cloth in stock. This was a commodity that the puppet government forcibly seized from private enterprises through illegal means. In terms of reason, it should still be ascertained the actual number and distributed in proportion to the total loss, so that the vitality of the textile industry can be slightly restored. This is the government's first easy task, without any loss to the national treasury, and entrepreneurs will benefit from it, how is this compared to those who stop factories and stop business waiting for aid from the Allied countries?</p>
<p>If the damage caused by the purchase of yarn and cloth can be compensated in a short period of time, then the vitality will be slightly restored and the foothold will be stable. The government in power will then provide industrial loans and allocate enemy and puppet dyes to help them. Those in the private sector who are rich in entrepreneurial responsibilities will save on use, improve products to revitalize them, and the private textile industry may not be able to recover.</p>
<p>III. How should state-owned and private enterprises work together?</p>
<p>Although state-owned enterprises are a transition, how should they work together with private enterprises during this transition period? This is also a question worthy of discussion. In terms of the current situation, state-owned and private enterprises should first work together in terms of equipment and technology. The state-owned factories received from the enemy and puppet regimes, such as Neiwai, Toyota, Rihua, Tongxing, Dakang, and Shanghai factories in Shanghai, have mostly good equipment. Before the war, about three-quarters of the grey cloth from private dyeing and finishing factories was purchased from them. Now that they have been taken over by the state, the scope of operation is not wide, and the equipment of private factories that have suffered war losses is incomplete. It is appropriate to contact each other, or lease a portion of the idle machinery to private enterprises, so that the useless can be turned into useful, which will not harm the state-owned factories, but will benefit the private factories. As for the technical personnel, they originally came from private factories. Now, due to the lack of manpower in state-owned factories, they have to retain a part of the enemies. How can this be sustained for a long time? Private factories should provide assistance and allow them to be transferred, so that everyone can make the best of their talents and the production industry can be promoted as a whole. Then, when state-owned factories are transferred to private ownership in the future, the people of the country will be able to handle it with ease and each will get what they deserve. Secondly, how state-owned factories will sell their manufactured products in the future should also cooperate with private manufacturers. The types of products should avoid conflicts with private factories as much as possible. In other words, state-owned factories should produce less of what private factories can generally produce, and private industrial and commercial enterprises should also provide assistance to them. If the business becomes related and the products do not infringe, the effectiveness of the arms and fingers will be achieved, and the entire textile industry will be on the right track. Recently, private factories have mostly been in a state of panic, thinking that although state-owned factories have been idle for many days, they have not yet started selling. If the price is too low when they sell in the future, private factories will not be able to withstand the pressure. Although this seems to be private factories overemphasizing their own interests, the raw materials of state-owned factories come from the materials received from the enemy and puppet regimes, or are borrowed from Allied countries. The cost can be suppressed to a very low level, which is something that the well-run private factories can do.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in terms of raw materials, state-owned factories are now superior to private factories. It goes without saying that the original accumulation of dyes and yarn and cloth is in the receiving factories. Even in the import merchants such as De Fu Foreign Firm, the authorities have not clearly announced how much can be distributed to private enterprises. For the sake of the entire textile industry, it should be added to the section, and imported raw materials can be delivered within two or three months. State-owned factories can ask the government to place orders abroad. What is accumulated today will be what is surplus or outdated in the future. If some can be allocated to help private enterprises, then considerable capital can be used to order very few goods for private use. The authorities should pay serious attention to this.</p>
<p>The state-owned factories that have started work have all started work. The authorities should also consider whether the ones that have not started work must still be occupied by the state-owned enterprises. There are now more than 40 small enemy factories, and valuation and bidding are underway. Among them, except for a few factories, most of them are small in scale and not enough for expansion. However, there have been many private entrepreneurs who intend to apply for purchase. From this, it can be seen how urgent the demand for factories that can be used for production is in the private sector. Therefore, state-owned factories should select some that will not start work immediately and lease some to private enterprises. If we are thinking about the entire textile industry, we should not consider this part to be superfluous.</p>
<h3>How to Determine the Exchange Rate</h3>
<p>— Liu Dajun</p>
<p>After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, everyone had a lot of discussions about the foreign exchange rate, and the focus of the discussion was on the level of the new exchange rate and the date of the revision. During the war, although some people discussed this issue, because there were very few normal foreign exchange transactions at that time, they did not feel an urgent need to revise the exchange rate. The people who discussed it were just planning ahead. Now that international transportation is gradually恢复, China will soon rebuild international trade relations, so the past official foreign exchange price cannot continue to be maintained and must be changed, which is the general consensus. The government has also made a positive statement on this matter, so the reason why the revision has not yet been implemented is that the level of the new exchange rate is still difficult to determine for a while.</p>
<p>Some people think that the timing of the revision is very important, because the current domestic economic situation is still in turmoil, and it is impossible to find an appropriate standard for revision. Furthermore, it can also be said that since the economy has not yet stabilized, even if a new exchange rate is set, it will not last long and will still need to be adjusted continuously. Those who make this statement believe that it is better to let it go for the time being rather than revising it repeatedly. After the domestic economy gradually stabilizes at an appropriate time, the new exchange rate will be set again, so that it can be achieved once and for all. However, a country's domestic economy cannot be separated from its international economic relations. When international economic relations are gradually recovering, the domestic economic situation cannot be stabilized, and the foreign exchange rate itself directly affects the former and indirectly affects the latter. If the government still maintains the original official price, continues the method of settlement, controls a part of the export foreign exchange, and strictly reviews the applications of import merchants and others who need foreign exchange, then my country's international economic relations will still be abnormal. Even if the domestic economy is stable, the situation will definitely not last. Everyone knows that such a wartime foreign exchange policy is a short-term measure, which is enough to cause instability. What's more, the market exchange rate is bound to fluctuate widely under this premise, and it will become a factor that causes general economic fluctuations. I think it is impossible to hope that the domestic economy will stabilize within half a year or a year, or even two or three years. What we can only hope is to reduce the amplitude of economic fluctuations. Therefore, before the end of the war, I had already explained based on this view that the exchange rate must still go through several adjustments after the revision.</p>
<p>Conversely, if a reasonable method is used to adjust the exchange rate, although it cannot stabilize the domestic economy, it can at least weaken its dynamism. After the exchange rate is adjusted in this way, domestic prices can gradually approach foreign prices. As the difference between the two prices decreases, the fluctuation of the exchange rate itself can also be weakened. This is originally the argument for setting the exchange rate according to purchasing power parity. Recently, many people think that domestic prices are unstable, and there is still a big difference between the prices in the recovered areas and the rear areas. Even in each recovered area, the prices are not consistent, so they think that the purchasing power parity theory is not suitable for my country at this time. They probably want to wait until domestic prices return to consistency before adjusting the exchange rate. Although this statement seems to have a reason, in fact, it cannot be divided into two periods. The first period is to adjust domestic prices first, and the second period is to adjust domestic prices and foreign prices again. Moreover, doing so will not help stabilize my country's economy.</p>
<p>My country lacks transportation tools between various regions, and it will take a long time for goods to circulate smoothly. By then, the prices between various regions will gradually become consistent. The so-called "consistency" does not mean that it can be exactly the same, but the price difference between each region only represents the necessary transfer costs. (This cost is not limited to freight, but includes other "transfer costs", which is the Cost of transfer mentioned by Swedish scholar Professor Ohlin in his book "Interregional and International Trade".)</p>

<h3>Proposal for Establishing a Specialized Engineering Management Agency</h3>
<p>— Chen Ruxuan</p>
<p>(This article continues from the first page)</p>
<p>Therefore, many countries in Europe and America have established specialized engineering management agencies, such as the Federal Works Agency and Public Building Administration in the United States, and the Ministry of Works and Buildings, Ministry of Works and Planning, and Minister of Reconstruction in the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>In our country, the titles of officials in charge of public works have varied. In the Qin Dynasty, there was "Jiang Zuo," in the Han Dynasty, there was "Jiang Zuo Da Jiang," and from the Sui and Tang Dynasties to the Song, Yuan, Ming, and Qing Dynasties, there was the "Ministry of Works," all of which had specialized management functions. Since the Republic of China, the construction of public works has been divided among various administrative agencies. For example, the Ministry of Transportation manages projects such as railways, highways, telecommunications, and shipbuilding; the Ministry of Military Affairs manages projects such as barracks and military supply warehouses; the Ministry of Economic Affairs manages projects such as power and industrial and mining plant buildings; the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry and the Water Conservancy Commission manage projects such as farmland irrigation; and the municipal government manages projects such as roads, wharves, and sanitation. This system may be adequate when there is no large-scale engineering construction or when only maintenance is required. However, with the vigorous promotion of national construction and large-scale construction plans about to be launched, the current fragmentation of institutions, the dispersion of talent, the varying needs of all parties, and the differences in opinions will inevitably lead to disputes over priorities. It is truly problematic to expect all engineering projects to be carried out efficiently. Take railways alone. The Road Administration Department of the Ministry of Transportation is responsible for the operation and management of existing lines and also for the repair of damaged old lines and the construction of new lines, which is difficult to handle effectively. Furthermore, the construction of large ports in the East, North, and South is of such a grand scale that it cannot be undertaken by a single municipal government or other administrative agency.</p>
<p>Recalling the early days of the War of Resistance, the construction of airfields was the responsibility of the Aviation Commission, which combined engineering and management. However, after the sudden change in Burma, international channels were cut off, and the need for air transport increased dramatically. The expansion of airfields became urgent. Our national leaders, with foresight, established an Engineering Committee under the Military Affairs Commission to handle this project. Because of its specialized responsibilities, concentrated manpower, flexible command, and rapid deployment, the committee was able to accomplish its tasks, even when the projects were extremely large and the deadlines extremely tight, to meet military needs. This recent example serves as a valuable model for future construction.</p>
<p>Therefore, we believe that, as the nation actively engages in construction, to ensure specialized responsibility and concentrated effort, a specialized engineering management agency should be established under the Executive Yuan to oversee national engineering construction. This will ensure unified management, rapid progress, and the ability to deal with foreign affairs and utilize diplomacy without the confusion and conflicts among various departments.</p>
<p>Since this agency is specifically for engineering management, once a project is completed, it should be transferred to other administrative agencies for management and operation according to its nature. This will allow for division of labor and cooperation between engineering construction and administrative management, maximizing the effectiveness of each.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the scope of this specialized engineering management agency can be broadly divided into three categories:</p>
<p>(1) Projects to be handled directly: All engineering construction projects that do not fall under the jurisdiction of central ministries and local governments, such as the opening of ports (the three major ports in the East, South, and North as instructed by Sun Yat-sen), air bases, national defense fortresses, public buildings, and the training of technical personnel.</p>
<p>(2) Projects to be handled on behalf of others: All engineering construction projects that fall under the jurisdiction of central ministries and local governments, such as the expedited repair of railways and highways, the completion of river channels and dams, the installation of electrical power equipment, and the construction of factories and cities. These can be handled on behalf of the relevant agencies as designated by the central government or entrusted by the agencies themselves. Once the projects are completed, they will be transferred to the relevant administrative agencies for handover.</p>
<p>(3) Projects to be handled jointly: Projects funded by foreign countries or jointly funded by Chinese and foreign parties may be handled by the central government at any time due to technical cooperation or any other special circumstances.</p>

<h3>The Shanghai Municipal Government After the Restoration</h3>
<p>— Qian Dajun</p>
<p>(Continued from the "Municipal Government" section on page two)</p>
<p>B. Adjusting the Social Economy</p>
<p>Economic measures are closely related to people's livelihoods and are extremely difficult to manage. Although this city is a commercial and industrial center, it suffered eight years of exploitation and devastation by the enemy and puppets. At the beginning of its restoration, the social economy was weakened and in urgent need of adjustment and development. Therefore, we have done our best to provide assistance.</p>
<p>1. Assessing Prices: An evaluation committee was established. If the prices of various industries needed to be increased, they were required to submit a request to the committee for joint evaluation before being approved. This was intended to achieve regulation and stabilization. Trade associations were also notified to report prices weekly to the Municipal Government for verification and adjustment.</p>
<p>2. Regulating Food Supply: The food supply was overseen by a special commissioner from the Ministry of Food, and the Municipal Government also appointed a special commissioner to supervise the rice industry. The rice market was restored, and all restrictions on rice businesses imposed during the enemy and puppet regime were lifted, restoring free trade and procurement. Measures were also drafted to order the industry to purchase in bulk to ensure supply.</p>
<p>3. Centralized Fuel Control: At the beginning of Shanghai's restoration, there was a severe coal shortage. Emergency measures were taken to establish a Temporary Fuel Supervisory Committee, responsible for taking over the existing coal supply and coordinating its distribution. This ensured that public utilities were not interrupted during the restoration period. Later, when the Shanghai Fuel Management Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs was established, this responsibility was transferred to that committee.</p>
<p>4. Adjusting Public Utility Prices: The city's public utilities had suffered long-term damage and were in urgent need of repair and replenishment. Employee compensation needed to be adjusted, and the soaring prices of needed materials had made it impossible to maintain operations. Therefore, the requests of the various companies were accepted. Based on the principles of protecting the burden on citizens and maintaining the companies' expenses, permission was granted to adjust prices on a trial basis.</p>
<p>C. Undertaking Relief Efforts</p>
<p>The people of this city suffered greatly after the destruction of war and the devastation by the enemy and puppets. The government was deeply concerned, and relief efforts were a top priority.</p>
<p>1. Relief for Unemployed Workers: Since the takeover of enemy and puppet factories inevitably resulted in temporary shutdowns, coupled with rising prices and insufficient power, unemployed workers faced extremely difficult living conditions, and labor unrest occurred from time to time. In the past three months, there have been 729 labor disputes, most of which have been resolved through mediation or persuasion. Regarding relief for unemployed workers, a committee has been actively organized in conjunction with the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Social Affairs and other relevant agencies. However, this relief is only a passive measure. The fundamental solution is to start from the proactive side, that is, to carry out labor welfare programs to alleviate their living difficulties. This work includes investigating the original labor welfare facilities in various factories, inspecting the health and safety facilities in various factories, promoting labor consumer cooperatives, and organizing labor films, all of which are in the design and implementation phase.</p>
<p>2. Relief for the General Public: The first step was to establish a municipal relief center, which first set up refugee and orphan shelters, accommodating more than 1,000 people. There are plans to expand. The second step was to organize winter relief, establishing a Winter Relief Committee, bringing together leaders from the charitable community to work together. The third step was to establish pawnshops and public housing. The first pawnshop has been opened, and the second will soon be established. Four public housing estates have been reorganized, and there are plans to gradually expand. The preliminary design of the construction of public housing has been completed.</p>
<p>D. Rectifying Citywide Transportation</p>
<p>Transportation is most closely related to the welfare of citizens. The city's transportation was originally very developed, but it has declined since the enemy and puppet occupation. Therefore, after taking over, the Municipal Government had to make every effort to rectify it to avoid affecting the lives of citizens:</p>
<p>1. Roads: In Huangpu District (the former concession area), about 340,000 square meters of road surface urgently needed to be repaired, and the ditches needed to be completely cleared. Moreover, the road systems in various districts of the city were extremely disorganized due to the failure to unify administrative power in the past and had to be completely reorganized and revised. In addition, the narrow main roads and traffic congestion also needed to be gradually widened according to plan. The above items have been largely completed based on the preliminary reorganization plan. As for transportation, in addition to the original ones, there are also plans to restore public buses, first restoring operations in the South Shanghai area, and to reorganize small railways, maintaining two round trips per month on the Upper Chuan and Upper South lines. In addition, most of the street lights in various districts were demolished or reduced in brightness in the past, and many have been actively reorganized and restored. Regarding traffic management, such as checking motor vehicles, renewing car licenses, and reorganizing traffic signs, these are also being implemented one by one according to plan. This year, the change to driving on the right side of the road was made after extensive publicity and thorough preparation.</p>
<p>2. Waterways: In addition to the Huangpu and Wusong rivers being the responsibility of the Dredging Bureau, the small rivers related to water conservancy, farmland, and transportation in the four rural areas were almost completely silted up, and bridges, docks, and seawalls were in disrepair and urgently needed to be dredged and repaired. The repair work has been nearly completed according to the preliminary reorganization plan, and the dredging work has been planned and is ready to begin. Reconnaissance of the seawalls is also in the planning stage. As for transportation, one is to restore several ferry lines, and the other is to reorganize the Huangpu and Wusong rivers ferry service. Twenty-five routes have been approved for resumption. In addition, ship registration work has also been implemented.</p>
<p>E. Transforming Social Mores</p>
<p>The city has always been a breeding ground for corruption due to the concessions. Since the enemy and puppets occupied it, the social atmosphere has deteriorated. If it is not corrected forcefully, the future will be unimaginable. The way to correct it can be divided into two types: passive and active.</p>
<p>1. Passive Aspects: The enemy and puppets aimed to destroy the physical and mental strength of our nation in order to eliminate the freedom and independence of our country. Therefore, they implemented a policy of corruption and poisoning in order to achieve their conspiracy. As a result, opium dens were everywhere in the city, gambling was rampant, and prostitutes were everywhere, and countless people were addicted to them. After the Municipal Government took over, it first had to eliminate these three evils. In addition to strictly banning gambling and rewarding people for reporting it secretly in order to eliminate it, a general inspection method for eliminating opium poison has been formulated to eliminate opium poison in the shortest possible time. The prostitution problem is more complicated, and the methods for suppressing it are being studied.</p>
<p>2. Active Aspects: In order to promote the New Life Movement, a New Life Movement Promotion Association has been established to actively carry out various tasks. At present, the main purpose is to cultivate the citizens' vigorous and enterprising spirit. One of the specific methods is to promote social education and promote legitimate entertainment to replace opium smoking and gambling, and to improve the citizens' physical and mental health. For example, the parks are being reorganized and opened for citizens to play, and the libraries are being replenished and restored for citizens to read. A sports committee and sports association have been established to actively promote various sports, increase sports venues, and convert the original gambling venues into public sports venues to facilitate citizens' exercise. Other museums and zoos have also been assigned personnel to prepare, and they should be gradually restored in the short term. In addition, a music center station will be established, a fine arts center station will be planned, and a labor center station will be established to improve the public's ability to appreciate and create music and art.</p>
<p>F. Promoting Citywide Education</p>
<p>Education is the foundation of a country, and it is most closely related to inheriting the past and opening up the future. The city's education has been affected by the enemy and puppets, and it is very heavy to reorganize and promote it. The following items are especially noteworthy:</p>
<p>1. Receiving Schools at All Levels: There are a large number of municipal and private primary and secondary schools in the city. When the enemy and puppets invaded, they arbitrarily changed the system, which was chaotic. After the Municipal Government took over, it restored and took over them separately and worked hard to reorganize them; those that should be closed were identified and the students were assigned to municipal schools; private schools were registered, investigated, and inspected one by one.</p>
<p>2. Planning to Establish a Scientific Experiment Institute: In order to focus on scientific education and remedy the lack of science equipment in private schools, a scientific experiment institute was planned. Two experimental center stations have been established, instructors have been hired, schedules have been arranged, and students from public and private middle schools have been assigned to practice in rotation to increase teaching effectiveness.</p>
<p>3. National Education: After the Municipal Government was established, it began to prepare for the implementation of national education, formulated an implementation plan, and investigated the population distribution in various districts of the city. Next, it divided the city into sixteen districts and prioritized the establishment of sixteen central national schools, which were given special supervision and guidance.</p>
<p>4. Eliminating Illiteracy: There are many illiterate people in the city, and supplementary education needs to be promoted urgently. At present, illiteracy is being investigated by region, and folk schools are being established. In addition to setting up seventeen classes in the experimental folk schools, twenty-one municipal folk schools are being planned, and municipal primary and secondary schools are ordered to run folk schools concurrently.</p>
<p>G. Promoting Citizens' Health</p>
<p>The importance of health is well known and need not be repeated. There are three important tasks:</p>
<p>1. Cleaning Up the City's Garbage: When the Municipal Government took over, there was garbage piled up in various districts, totaling 111,515 tons. After the restoration, manpower and tools were concentrated to clear it all in nine days and nights. The regular cleaning work has not been relaxed at all, and a Cleanliness Movement Week has been held to awaken the attention and assistance of citizens. Although it is not yet ideal, it has made significant progress compared to the beginning of the takeover and is still continuing to work hard.</p>
<p>2. Establishing Municipal Hospitals: After the medical institutions in the city were reorganized, ten municipal hospitals were officially established with more than 900 beds, which is far from enough. Each hospital has free beds to benefit the poor. There are a total of 486 free beds in the city, accounting for half of the total beds. In the future, hospitals will be added and gradually increased as the first stage of promoting the public medical system.</p>
<p>3. Preventing and Controlling Infectious Diseases: Last September, there was a serious outbreak of true cholera in the city. After emergency measures were taken, the epidemic was slightly curbed. Vaccination work has also been carried out. In addition, there is fly and louse control work, which has been done with the assistance of the Allied health authorities, using DDT special medicine to spray in prisons and airports, and is still continuing.</p>
<p>H. Completing Cadastral Reorganization</p>
<p>During the occupation of the city, the land boundaries were disrupted by the enemy and puppets, and the people's property rights were no longer guaranteed. At the beginning of the Municipal Government's restoration, it was determined that the completion of land registration was one of the important administrative guidelines in order to clear up land rights and stabilize people's livelihoods. The progress is briefly described as follows:</p>
<p>1. Land Surveying: There are three items completed in Huangpu District: household land surveying, organizing maps and registers, adding fish scale registers, and handling accumulated survey cases.</p>
<p>2. Land Registration: One is to carry out ownership and transfer registration, which will be opened in the six districts where land surveying has been completed, and those who apply for registration are enthusiastic. The second is to handle land transfer, that is, in areas where land registration has not yet been opened, those who have transferred land rights will be handled according to law, and at the same time, according to the central government's order, the deed tax will be reorganized. The third is to handle perpetual lease land. Except for perpetual lease land held by foreigners, which will continue to be retained before the method of exchanging new land ownership certificates is stipulated, according to the order of the Executive Yuan, Chinese people who hold perpetual lease land should apply for ownership registration. The fourth is to clear up the land rights registration made by the puppet regime, which are invalid. Another land registration will be carried out to protect the legal property rights of Chinese people and foreign businessmen.</p>
<p>3. Land Valuation: In the districts where land registration is being carried out, the land prices will be divided into groups to observe and determine the land price segments, and maps and charts will be drawn. This work is in progress. However, in order to control the declared land prices of people's land registration, the valuation table of 1941 is temporarily used, and the current situation is taken into account to increase it by 200 times as a temporary standard for reviewing declared prices.</p>
<p>I. Promoting Local Autonomy</p>
<p>The central government has decided to implement constitutional government as soon as possible, and the foundation of constitutional government lies in local autonomy. Therefore, this work is imminent. However, this city is the cultural and economic center of the country, and the people's level of knowledge is also the crown of all regions. It is easier to promote local autonomy than in other regions. In order to achieve this task, the current facilities of the Municipal Government are as follows:</p>
<p>1. Organizing the Baojia System: The city's handling of the Baojia system is a pioneering initiative. Therefore, it is decided to adopt a top-down approach, that is, from the city to the districts, and from the districts to the bao. When the district offices and the bao offices are established, various bao compilation and household checking tasks will be started. After the compilation and checking are completed, people's representative bodies at all levels will be established according to law. At present, the district offices have been established, and the candidates for district heads have been announced. They will be able to start working officially in the short term, and the household checking work can also begin.</p>
<p>2. Planning to Establish People's Representative Bodies at All Levels: People's representative bodies at all levels in the city will be gradually established after the Baojia system is compiled. It is expected that citizen publicity and the review of candidates for public office will begin in January of this year, the bao people's congress will be opened in February, the district people's congress will be established in March, and the municipal council will be established in April. Before the municipal council is established, a temporary municipal council will be established first. The list of candidates has been submitted to the central government for approval, and the establishment meeting will be convened as soon as it is announced.</p>
<p>In addition, the organization of the Advisory Committee can be mentioned. Municipal facilities should be widely consulted, gather ideas, and benefit from each other. However, the number of municipal councillors is limited by laws and regulations. In order to meet the needs, the Advisory Committee is organized. Its candidates are not limited to nationalities, so foreign residents in the city can also participate. Not only will they be able to make contributions to municipal construction, but they will also benefit the friendship of the Allied countries.</p>
<p>J. Reorganizing Financial Administration</p>
<p>Reorganizing financial administration aims to eliminate corruption and eliminate embezzlement. In order to achieve this goal, in addition to severely punishing corruption, emphasis must be placed on establishing a good system. There are three types that have been implemented in the past three months:</p>
<p>1. Enforcing the Treasury System: The advantage of the treasury system is that general financial management personnel and tax collection personnel do not directly handle cash, so as to prevent them from having the opportunity to commit fraud. The method is that the city bank sets up treasury collection offices in various tax collection agencies, and dispatches personnel to directly collect money. Citizens pay taxes and directly hand them over to the treasury for verification. The Finance Bureau has been ordered to sign an agency city treasury agreement with the Shanghai City Bank, which has been implemented. After the implementation of this system, the evils of floating collection discounts and the practice of pursuing private gain and corruption will be completely eliminated.</p>
<p>2. Simplifying Collection Procedures: There are many municipal taxes, and they are scattered in various bureaus. Most of them are collected by merchants on behalf of the government. Taxpayers and collectors collude with each other, and many malpractices arise. The way to simplify and refine collection is to organize a tax review committee. Taxpayers report their monthly business operations to the relevant trade association chambers of commerce and collection agencies, and conduct preliminary joint review before submitting it to the review committee to assess the amount of tax payable. If it is found that the report is false, personnel will be sent to conduct spot checks. Since its implementation, merchants and people have found it convenient, and tax revenue has increased.</p>
<p>3. Making Outdoor Work Serious: It is stipulated that outdoor personnel must have an outdoor pass and an outdoor order when they go out on official business. When they arrive at the place of work, they must first hand it over for inspection, otherwise the merchants and people can escort them to the police station for investigation. In addition, the Finance Bureau has a secret reporting box, which is opened by the director himself every day, so that he can diligently seek people's opinions. Since its implementation, it has been quite effective.</p>
<p>The above are just the highlights. In addition, there are items such as handling industrial and commercial registration, organizing public organizations, improving water and electricity supply, and managing housing rentals, which will not be described due to space limitations.</p>
<p>Dajun was ordered to come and be the head of Shanghai. Before leaving, the Chairman repeatedly instructed him to relieve the people of their suffering and seek happiness. After taking office, he gave hundreds of speeches to his subordinates, in which he put forward the term "people-oriented." All municipal facilities should be based on the interests of the people. Those that benefit the people must be done with all their strength, and those that harm the people must be eliminated with all their strength. Seeing that the above items are all related to the welfare of citizens and are all for the benefit of citizens, I am confident that I have not failed the Chairman's instructions and my own promises. However, at the beginning of the city's restoration, there were many difficulties, and all facilities were felt to be unsatisfactory. I hope that social elites and leaders from all walks of life will provide guidance and advice from time to time and work together to make Shanghai's municipal administration have brilliant achievements in the future, which is what Dajun sincerely prays for.</p>
<h3>Overview of the Shanghai City Defense Corps</h3>
<p>The more prosperous a city, the more difficult it is to establish public order. This city has a population of over four million, with Chinese and foreigners intermingling. The former concessions were especially a breeding ground for crime. Since the war, people's livelihoods have declined, and as the saying goes, "Hunger and cold breed theft," making local public order increasingly unstable. Recognizing this, the authorities organized the City Defense Corps on November 16th through the City Defense Committee. An overview of the Corps is introduced below.</p>
<p>Work Overview</p>
<p>The Corps, with the important mission of protecting citizens, assisting the military and police, eliminating bandits and dissidents, and ensuring public order, also strives to implement military training and complete the foundation of national education. It was established on November 16th, 1945. The commander of the Corps is General Rong Youlue. He has already begun to organize the constituent district regiments and brigades, recruit corps members and guards, select cadres, prepare for defense training, and plan for equipment and uniforms. Although it has only been a little over a month, it has already taken shape. As for other tasks, they remain to be gradually unfolded.</p>
<p>Organization</p>
<p>The Corps is subordinate to the Defense Committee, with the mayor as the director. Military actions are directed by the Songhu Garrison Headquarters. The Corps headquarters has jurisdiction over eight district regiments: Pudong, Hunan, Husi, Hubei, Hubei, Punan, Hubei, and Wusong, as well as five standing brigades. Each district regiment has jurisdiction over three or two brigades, and each brigade has jurisdiction over three companies, mainly composed of volunteer corps members within the respective areas. They are responsible for defense within their jurisdiction during peacetime, preventing the activities of traitors and bandits. When necessary, they can be mobilized regardless of region to respond to changes in the situation. The standing brigades are composed of standing guards, stationed at necessary locations as the main powerful forces for defense, and also serve as a model for the implementation of training for volunteer corps members.</p>
<p>Quality</p>
<p>The recruitment of corps members and guards and the selection of cadres strive for excellent "quality" rather than massive "quantity," in order to eliminate the dross and retain the essence, forming a well-trained team. Therefore, the general quality is excellent. In addition to a portion of volunteer corps members who were members of the defense corps with good performance before the war, and members of the Shanghai Chinese Company of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps, all are good citizens who volunteered based on a spirit of initiative and passed the selection process. The standing guards are strong men who have passed strict examinations and are excellent in academics, thought, and physique, and their quality is better than ordinary teams.</p>
<p>The voluntary cadres at all levels are capable and experienced people from various regions, with enthusiasm for service, so they are all respected figures. The standing cadres are excellent military officers who have received profound military officer education and have war experience and merits.</p>
<p>After the establishment of the district regiments, due to the citizens' awareness of responsibility, they volunteered to participate enthusiastically. Currently, the number of volunteer corps members registered in each district regiment has reached 11,000. The first batch of standing guards recruited totaled 512. It is planned to carefully select and recruit in stages to reach the fixed quota.</p>
<p>Equipment</p>
<p>The weapons currently available, in addition to rifles, include light and heavy machine guns and various grenade launchers, which can be used for defense and training. However, due to financial constraints, the uniforms of officers and soldiers are still being actively planned. It is hoped that all sectors can provide assistance.</p>
<p>Future Plans</p>
<p>Reorganization</p>
<p>Due to the necessity of the mission, the Corps plans to reorganize the volunteer teams of each district regiment in a meticulous and appropriate manner within a short period of time, and to replenish their equipment to make them sound, as a foundation for defense. The standing brigades will gradually form the prescribed number of troops with the guards recruited successively. In addition to the general infantry companies, it is also planned to establish heavy machine gun squads. If the situation permits, communication units can be added to achieve communication and contact in the jurisdiction.</p>
<p>Defense</p>
<p>In view of the approach of winter, which easily leads to theft cases, the Corps, in order to achieve the "defense" mission, will implement out-defense with a part of the corps members as soon as possible. The time is until the end of February, a total of two months. The daily out-defense time is tentatively set at five hours. If necessary, the time will be extended and the number of out-defense corps members will be increased. The troops responsible for out-defense are divided into alert, patrol, and reserve squads, and closely coordinate with the military and police to prevent bandits and dissidents.</p>
<p>Training</p>
<p>The main purpose of training, in addition to acquiring the necessary knowledge and skills to accomplish the mission, is to focus on moral education, stimulate the spirit of perseverance, cultivate strict military discipline and obedience, inspire good habits, exercise strong physique, and eliminate the atmosphere of following old ways, so as to become healthy "national defense people."</p>
<p>Education is divided into corps member (guard) education, unit education, cadre education, and special education. The duration of corps member (guard) education is two months, unit (company and below) education is four months, and the first phase of education is scheduled to be completed from New Year's Day to the end of June.</p>
<p>The main subjects of corps member (guard) and unit education are as follows:</p>
<p>Basic Combat Training - Field Service</p>
<p>Night Education - Shooting Education</p>
<p>Physical Training and Martial Arts - Civic Knowledge</p>
<p>Baojia Knowledge - Air Defense and Anti-Poison and Modern Military Knowledge</p>
<p>Cadre education will be based on the necessity of their duties, using American training methods, and referring to war experience to select rotations for implementation, in order to achieve perfection and achieve twice the result with half the effort.</p>
<p>Legal System</p>
<p>The Corps plans to compile various regulations for the Corps and its subordinate teams in the near future, for the purpose of following them in the implementation of various tasks now and in the future. Other organizations concerning corps member sports and recreation, compilation and distribution of reading materials, and various facilities are also being planned.</p>

<h3>Handling Enemy Property and Economic Construction</h3>
<p>— Wu Chengxi</p>
<p>I. The Vast Enemy Property</p>
<p>Although the people suffered greatly during the eight years of bloody war, we dare to say that, except for the invaluable lives of soldiers and civilians who sacrificed for the country, which are irretrievable, we have not suffered materially. Not only have we not suffered, but we have also gained an exceptionally vast asset—the assets confiscated from the enemy and puppets. From an individual standpoint, some families were destroyed, some factories were burned, and some wealth was lost. Everyone suffered some losses, but from the standpoint of the entire country, the eight years of resistance were by no means a sacrifice in vain. The gains from the final victory may exceed the sum of the damages suffered by the people.</p>
<p>The vastness of enemy property is related to their vain attempt to annex China and conquer the world, and it is also mutually causative with China's long-term resistance. After the September 18th Incident, they actively developed the Northeast in order to use it as a base for invading China. After the July 7th Incident, the all-out resistance of August 13th followed. After the withdrawal from Wuhan, the situation of long-term resistance became increasingly prominent, so they also used a century-long war to deal with us. In politics, they used puppet organizations to carry out their ambition to enslave China, and in economics, they controlled on the one hand and developed on the other, and plundered thoroughly to implement the policy of using war to support war and using Chinese to control Chinese. During the execution of this policy, our resources were developed, enemy factories were built in the country, warehouses, blockhouses, railways, highways, and agricultural and industrial experimental fields were added, counterfeit currency was rampantly issued, but materials were highly concentrated. Some were even hoarded for several years. They originally wanted to work hard in China for a lifetime, but unexpectedly the Japanese-American war broke out, and they gradually fell from advantage to disadvantage. Gradually, their homeland was invaded, and overseas transportation lines were cut off and blockaded day by day, until the homeland was separated from the mainland. Not long after, the atomic bomb was dropped, and the Japanese Empire completely collapsed. The results of the various development and construction projects carried out by the enemy in China over the past ten years are now completely occupied by us—although many have suffered considerable damage. The materials that the enemy desperately searched for and gathered in these years could not be transported away and had to be returned to their original owners—this is the origin of the vast enemy property.</p>
<p>Here we can look at a few specific numbers.</p>
<p>According to the research conducted by Mr. Yuan Qingyan in the past two years, the scope of Japanese investment in China is very wide. Agriculture, industry, mining, finance, trade and commerce, transportation and other miscellaneous industries are almost all included. Among them, the industrial item includes textile industry, chemical industry, hardware machinery industry, construction industry, food industry, wood furniture industry, clothing supplies industry, ceramics industry and miscellaneous industries, and the departments are also very numerous. If we add up the companies whose headquarters are in China and those whose headquarters are in Japan, Korea, and Taiwan, the number of Japanese-invested companies in China is nearly 4,000 (Mr. Yuan's statistics do not include companies with capital below 100,000 yen, but I think there are more) and the capital amount is 80 billion yen. The details can be seen in the table below:</p>
<p>Statistics of Japanese Investment in China (Note)</p>
<p>Headquarters in Japan, Taiwan, Korea Headquarters in China</p>
<p>Industry Number of Companies Capital (Thousands of Yen) Number of Companies Capital (Thousands of Yen)</p>
<p>Agriculture 1 1,000 5 460</p>
<p>Mining 8 1,414,487 18 74,855</p>
<p>Manufacturing Industry 142 869,936 746 533,401</p>
<p>Financial Industry 34 594,060 43 24,070</p>
<p>Trade and Commerce 515 3,229,528 2,105 285,136</p>

<p>Total 737 6,917,393 3,149 1,044,040</p>
<p>(Note: This table is excerpted from "Economic Weekly" Volume 1, Issue 1, pages 17-18)</p>
<p>The statistics made by Mr. Yuan above do not include enemy property in the Northeast. If added, the "Total" will definitely be much larger. Regarding the situation in the Northeast, we do not have accurate figures to verify now. However, according to the estimate made by Mr. Huo Shishu, the director of the China Economic Construction Association, two years ago, the Japanese enemy's investment in that area "reached more than 170 billion yuan." We do not know whether this figure is still applicable now, but from the enemy's active spirit in developing the Northeast in recent years, this figure is probably only too small and not too large. (See Mr. Huo's figures in "Economic Construction Quarterly" Volume 1, Issue 4, page 11 for details)</p>
<p>The above is in terms of the national scope. Now let's see what the situation is in Shanghai. According to a survey by a powerful source, as of the end of September 1945, the net asset value of the 2,037 Japanese industries in Shanghai was 19 billion yuan in legal currency. The details are as follows:</p>

<p>From the Shanghai District Enemy and Puppet Property Disposal Bureau, we have also obtained some scattered information, which is also compiled here for everyone's reference:</p>
<p>(1) Regarding factories—It is said that more than 400 enemy and puppet factories in Shanghai have been taken over. Among them, the textile industry has 1.23 million spindles and yarn spindles.</p>
<p>(2) Shops—560 Japanese shops have been taken over, and the estimated value is very large. The two German merchants, China-Germany Fufu and Bayer, were also taken over, and the total value is said to be more than 200-300 million yuan.</p>
<p>(3) Materials—It is said that more than 900 warehouses of materials have been taken over in Shanghai, and the counting is still in progress. Most of the materials have not been used. Because of the wide variety and large quantity of these materials, they will have a good impact on the future of prices when they are put on the market one after another.</p>
<p>(4) Real estate—It is said that more than 10,000 buildings have been taken over in Shanghai. Those still living in enemy residences have not yet been included.</p>
<p>(5) In addition, the number of transportation tools, machinery and equipment, educational and cultural institutions, farms, banks, gold and silver coins, etc. is even more considerable.</p>
<p>The enemy property in Shanghai is already so considerable. After the enemy property in Tianjin, Pingjin, and the Northeast is all counted, the total number will definitely be so large that it is hard to believe. So, how should we take it over and use it well?</p>
<p>II. Enemy Property Utilization and Our Economic Future</p>
<p>Judging from the experience of the past four months, the work of taking over enemy and puppet property has indeed gone through a very chaotic period. The receiving agencies were not unified, the staff could not be fair and selfless, "receiving is stagnation," warehouses caught fire, materials were lost and damaged, and the complete business system was often fragmented. All these are caused by the victory being too fast, the government's lack of preparation, improper use of people, or simply a lack of talent. Since the establishment of enemy and puppet property disposal in various regions, the above-mentioned bad situations have been greatly improved. Given time, it is believed that the reception and sorting of enemy property can be effectively brought to an end. The question for the future is how to use it.</p>
<p>The confiscation of enemy property is essentially a form of war indemnity. Historically, there are countless examples of victors collecting indemnities from the defeated and thus causing the rich and powerful after the war: Germany after the Franco-Prussian War and Japan after the Sino-Japanese War are two of the most obvious examples in modern times of victors obtaining large amounts of indemnity from the defeated and thus making rapid economic progress in their countries. Why can't China in the future lay a part of the foundation for economic recovery from the vast enemy property?</p>
<p>Regarding how the enemy property should be rationally and effectively used in the future, the government has its own overall policy, which we do not need to plan for. Moreover, the geographical distribution of enemy property is wide and the types are extremely complex, and the specific use is not something that outsiders can plan. Therefore, what we can talk about now is limited to one or two principles of use.</p>
<p>As everyone knows, China is a country with a very backward industry. Therefore, the first policy to be adopted in the future when using enemy property is to transform enemy property into a powerful weapon to quickly develop my country's industrialization. The light and heavy industrial institutions and other various equipment left by the enemy in our country, especially in North China and the Northeast, are considerable. We should properly and completely invest this part of capital into the production process, thereby improving China's productivity, improving people's living standards, accelerating the progress of industrialization, and promoting the high-speed accumulation of national capital. If this can be done, it is believed that the process of China's industrialization can be greatly shortened. In order to make all productive enemy property fully utilized, we believe that the government should mobilize all private capital to participate in the operation as much as possible. Except for those that are closely related to national defense or that private capital is unable to operate for a while, the government should use all enemy property in the form of entrusted operation, joint government-business operation, lease, sale, etc. to use private capital and human resources to seek the most effective use and development of enemy property. Unnecessary government operation and inefficient government operation are not enough to be a lesson.</p>
<p>Second, regarding the materials confiscated from the enemy and puppets, we believe that they should be used separately in two aspects: for various raw materials, those needed by the government should be provided to the government, those needed by general manufacturers should be allocated to various manufacturers at a fair price, and those that can be provided to the foreign market should be used to promote foreign trade. In short, they should not be used indiscriminately, but they should not be hoarded and unused. Regarding various grains and various daily necessities, we believe that they should be put on the market as soon as possible, one to increase the supply of materials and the other to maintain the stable price of materials. There are 900 warehouses in Shanghai, which are worth a lot; there are also 600 billion yuan of goods stored in more than 100 warehouses in Tianjin (see the Dagong Newspaper on December 15). If these materials are used properly, it is believed that they will be very beneficial to industrial production and people's lives in the future.</p>
<p>Third, we should also use enemy property to balance finances, reduce issuance, stabilize currency value, and reduce the burden on the people. The fair sale of materials, the sale of gold and silver coins, the sale of real estate, the disposal of companies and shops, and the lease or sale of unnecessary factories can all obtain a very large amount of funds, the number of which may have to be expressed in units of three "wan" characters. For such a large income, it is urgently needed by the financial authorities who have gone through years of hard war and are now facing the need to rebuild everything, and it is also an important way to solve the deficit finance during the transition period in the future. For many years, the people have suffered from extortion, inflation, and soaring prices. If a way out can be opened up in the disposal of enemy property in the future, so that the government does not increase taxes, does not resort to printing presses, and the annual expenditure is still not worried about having no way, then the national economy and the people's livelihood will benefit from both. In fact, if the enemy property is handled properly, the government may be able to get through this year even if it does not levy a single tax or issue a single banknote, because the actual value of enemy property is too great.</p>
<p>Finally, the "puppet" character of the enemy and puppets seems to need to be mentioned again. In recent years, almost all puppets are greedy, and it can also be said that all puppets are rich. In the process of purification, the people's fat and ointment searched by this group of people should be squeezed out as much as possible. The fields and houses they bought in cities and villages, the gold, foreign currency, diamonds, treasures, antiques, calligraphy and paintings they gathered, the stocks they invested in, and the goods they hoarded should all be confiscated, auctioned off, and the income should be put into the national treasury for national use. These things are actually the people's blood and sweat. If the government can make good use of them in the future, then the people's blood and sweat in the past will not have been wasted. It is only paid in advance in the folk, and it is used in arrears in the government.</p>
<p>Enemy property is vast, and the role of enemy property is especially vast. I hope the government will handle it carefully and use it properly. The revival of the national economy in the future will depend on it. 34, 12, 23.</p>
<h3>How to Determine the Exchange Rate</h3>
<p>— Liu Dajun</p>
<p>(This article is continued from page four)</p>
<p>But the war has already ended, and we cannot adopt a policy of isolationism, prohibiting international trade for a prolonged period. Since this is not feasible, and international transportation is more abundant than domestic, coastal cities will inevitably receive a large influx of imported goods first. Prices will continue to fall, and these goods will not be easily transported to the rear, causing a significant price difference between the rear and coastal areas. As a result, prices in coastal cities will first adjust to match international prices, while price adjustments in inland areas will lag behind.</p>
<p>The above assumes that the government continues to maintain its previous foreign exchange control policy, where foreign exchange for general importers comes from the black market. The adjustment between international prices and prices in coastal cities is calculated based on the black market exchange rate. According to our research, even calculated based on the pre-Republic black market price of US dollars, the prices of many goods are still much lower abroad than in Shanghai. Therefore, on the one hand, Shanghai prices will fall, and on the other hand, competition among importers to purchase foreign exchange will cause the future black market exchange rate to rise, meaning the black market rate will depreciate. As for prices in the rear, they will inevitably be manipulated by speculators due to the failure to restore normal supply and demand, so they will inevitably differ greatly from coastal prices. Given this situation, it is probably impossible to first adjust domestic prices or wait for domestic economic stability before revising the exchange rate and adjusting international prices.</p>
<p>To take a step back, even if this could be done, it would still be detrimental to our country in the long run. First, delaying the restoration of international trade would prevent our country from obtaining essential materials that we urgently need, which would be harmful to post-war economic recovery. The goods that the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) can provide have many limitations in terms of type and use, and the quantity is not sufficient. We cannot rely on this organization to provide all our normal needs. Second, even if prices in various parts of our country were to reach a consensus after a certain period, a significant fluctuation in prices across the country would occur once international trade resumes. The result of delaying the exchange rate adjustment is simply prolonging the period of price fluctuations, dividing one thing into two stages.</p>
<p>Some believe that delaying the revision of the exchange rate allows for observation of market exchange rate trends. If the market exchange rate reaches a certain level, indicating relative stability, the government can adopt this rate as the official rate. To adopt this approach, the government must open up foreign exchange, allowing foreign exchange banks and importers/exporters to freely buy and sell, in order to see the so-called "natural level." However, a sudden opening of foreign exchange will inevitably cause drastic fluctuations in both exchange rates and prices, and our country's balance of international payments will be difficult to achieve a fundamental equilibrium in the short term, making it difficult for the exchange rate to reach a relatively stable level. With such a shortage of domestic materials and such low international prices (with a limited increase compared to pre-war levels), our country's market exchange rate may inevitably decline rapidly, ultimately causing adverse psychological effects.</p>
<p>Since the author advocates revising the exchange rate as soon as possible, what level should be adopted? The most rational exchange rate is naturally the equilibrium exchange rate. However, as mentioned above, it will be difficult for our country's balance of international payments to achieve a fundamental equilibrium in the short term, making it hopeless to establish and maintain an equilibrium exchange rate. Calculating the equilibrium exchange rate uses purchasing power parity as a reference. Although it is not easy to calculate purchasing power parity when domestic prices are fluctuating greatly, it is possible to make an estimate. Fortunately, since the goal is not to seek a long-term equilibrium exchange rate, a slight deviation above or below does not matter. However, it is better for the exchange rate to be slightly undervalued than overvalued, because an overvalued exchange rate will hinder exports and encourage imports. While our country needs foreign materials, it would be unwise to excessively encourage imports. After the war, it is not convenient to strictly control imports and exports, so it is necessary to use an appropriate exchange rate to prevent the import of non-essential goods, while adopting subsidies or tax reductions/exemptions for the goods that are urgently needed to facilitate their import. The so-called non-essential goods do not only refer to luxury goods—luxury goods can be taxed—but should include certain daily necessities that can be produced domestically. Customs cannot impose heavy taxes on such goods, but must use an undervalued exchange rate to protect them. This does not conflict with the proposal to restore international trade as soon as possible, but it merely involves selecting the types of goods.</p>
<p>The other day, a newspaper here published an article by Mr. Yang Shijin, who believes that under the new exchange rate, one US dollar should be equal to 2,200 national currency units. His calculation is based on: the US wholesale price index being approximately 135, the Shanghai index being approximately 90,000, and the pre-war Sino-US exchange rate being 3.3 national currency units per US dollar. According to the current price indices of both sides, the purchasing power parity should be 1 to 2,200. The Shanghai price index he used is from August, calculated based on the price of counterfeit currency. If converted into legal tender at the market conversion rate of 1 to 130-140 at that time, general prices would be 700 times higher than before the war. The index of 90,000 used above is an estimate of the recent price level in Shanghai. We now have the Shanghai price index for October, which is 58,466, and is calculated in legal tender. Since its base period is 1936, this index shows that prices have only risen 585 times. If the purchasing power parity is calculated according to this index, one US dollar should be equal to 1,430 national currency units.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned index was compiled by Jin Cheng Bank and the Tongde Society, continuing the work of the China Economic Research Association. Although a geometric mean of commercial lists is used, the classified indices show that textiles, fuels, etc., are higher than the total index, and metals are more than three times higher, while only the food index is lower than the total index. From this, we can infer that although the items have not been weighted, there must be a large number of food items, so this category has been given a very heavy weight in a subtle way. (Yang Guangsheng also uses this index)</p>
<p>Originally, some people also use the cost of living index as the basis for calculating purchasing power parity. The Shanghai Municipal Government Research Office's November labor cost of living index is 102,190, more than 1000 times higher than before the war (calculated in legal tender), while the salary class index is 111,108, which is more than 1100 times higher than before the war. If the former is used, one US dollar should be equal to 2,495 national currency units, while if the latter is used, it should be 2,716 units. The weights of the cost of living index are based on the budgets of most families, which seems slightly better than the previous wholesale price index. According to general observations, current Shanghai prices should be around 1,000 times higher than before the war.</p>
<p>The government may not adopt such a high exchange rate due to other considerations, but I believe that it is better to err on the high side (that is, the exchange rate can be undervalued) when it is initially revised. Later, if foreign goods are imported, domestic production increases, transportation is convenient, and prices fall, it may be possible to gradually lower the exchange rate. This can produce good psychological effects, preventing capital from fleeing abroad, and allowing capital already abroad to "return," helping to adjust the balance of international payments.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I believe that the domestic economy cannot automatically achieve stability and needs to be urged by a rational foreign exchange policy, so it is advisable to adjust the exchange rate as soon as possible. After one revision, continued adjustments will inevitably be necessary under China's economic conditions, but it is appropriate to gradually lower the exchange rate (that is, increase the rate). As for which of the several purchasing power parities calculated in Shanghai should be adopted, or even if none of them are used at all, it does not matter much. Fortunately, this parity is only a reference, and how to choose under the principle of being undervalued depends on what the government policy emphasizes.</p>
