<h3 id="c1">中美友好商務條約　兩國首都同時公布　王外長司使爲簽訂代表 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓二日電〕據悉：美國務院與我外交部將於華區頓時間四日晨三時，即南京時間下午四時，同時公布中美友好商務條約全文。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京三日電〕國府四日令，特派王世杰，王化成，爲商訂中美友好通商航海條約全權代表。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓三日電〕國務院三日宣布，中美兩國已在南京簽訂友好通商及航海條約，定期五年。國務院官員並鄭重向聯合社記者聲明，美政府於此時與中國政府簽訂此約，絕無政治意義。代表美國簽字者爲駐華大使司徒雷登及美國特派員駐天津總領事史密士，商約條文共一萬字，包涵甚廣，俟美國參議院及中國立法院批准之日起發生效力。此約以亙惠平等爲原則，凡美國個人及公司在中國享受之權利，中國個人及公司亦可在美享受同樣權利，各項權利均於約中有明白詳盡之規定。此約係代替兩國間原有九種條約，如一八四四年七月三日簽訂之最初和平友好及通商條約等。</p>
<p>消除治外法權痕跡　規定相互經商原則</p>
<p>美官員稱：中美兩國必須簽訂此約，有多種原因，其一爲消除所謂治外法櫂之最後痕跡。此次新約，旨在以明白而合法之方式，規定兩國互相經營商業之原則，美商公司在中國所獲權利，因此稍爲擴大，惟中國內亂未已，美商所獲擴大的權利，目今多半僅存在紙上，不克實施。新約准許一國公民之公司與協會，得在另一國各地「居住，旅行及經商」，又可從事另一國法律所不禁之「商業，製造，科學·敎育，宗敎與慈善活動」，更可「取得，佔有，建造或租用相當屋宇」及租地，以進行上述各項活動。美國人可在中國會同中國人組織與加入公司，中國在美國亦然。所謂「最惠國」原則，屢見於新約中。新約又規定，如果兩國之一，以任何權利給予第三國之個人或公司得探測與開發鑛源，亦須以同樣權利給予另一簽約國。按照「通商與航海自由」條款，一國商船行駛另一國領海，並停泊各港口，但軍艦及漁船不在此例。</p>

<p>〔又電〕三日抵京訪問之暹羅元老　比里伯農榮，是暹羅現在强有力的領袖，暹羅政治舞台幕後的張綫人。從前他以鑾巴力著稱，「鑾」在暹羅是「子爵」的意思，鑾巴力在一九三二年六月政變後，自動把爵位取消恢復他原來　比里伯農榮的名字。他原籍廣東潮州，姓陳，漢名很少人知道，他不用漢名，也不承認是中國人，因爲他生在暹羅，依照暹羅法律，凡是生在暹羅的外國人，一律是認爲暹羅人，　比里未曾到過中國，他是法國留學生，習法律，天資聰明，有辦事才，從法國返暹後，參加政府工作，有相當地位，他是六月政變的智　，政變計劃是在他指導下完成的，政變後他成爲遇羅一個很有力量的領袖。翌年　比里擬就「新經濟政策，主張政府收買士地，然後分給人民耕種，農民變爲受僱於政府，人民議會認爲這個政策有共產黨色彩，他被認爲左傾，當時暹羅法律取締共產主義，　比里站不住脚，只好往外國一跑。後來暹政府組織審省委會，審査他是否眞正爲共產主義者，結果認爲他沒有左傾，於是他共產的「罪名」撤銷了，他又重上暹羅政治備台，先後出任外長·財長。一九三九年歐戰爆發，他看英國勢力日漸棄頹，日本勢力在亞洲膨脹，他於是向日本頻送秋波，擬博得日本的歡心，那時候旅暹華僑激於愛國心，紛起抵制日貨，捐款救國，鑾披汶政府在　比里幕後指導下，用高壓手段，禁阻華僑愛國行動，曼谷中華總商會主席蟻光炎，因爲領導捐款和其他愛國行動，而死於非命。根據這個政策，暹羅又和日本締結同盟協定，結果太平洋戰事發生時，暹羅假道日本侵略緬甸和馬來亞，同時宣布對英美宣戰，戰爭末期，　比里見勢不佳，一方面表面上敷衍日本，另一面又向同盟國通往來，在國內，他領導地下組織，呌做「自由泰，秘密抵抗日本。在國外，他派出「自由泰」工作人員，駐在英·美和中國，去年勝利時，　比里是攝政王，暹政府爲了要洗刷它和日本勾結的罪行，立刻發表宣言，宣布對英。美宣戰爲「不合法」及無效」，一面派代表到康提東南亞盟軍總部，商談「消弭戰爭狀態的條約，結果簽定英暹條約，因爲有寬大的美國從旁支持，暹羅除賠償英國戰時在暹利益所蒙受的一切損失和允許讓同盟國統制它的主要產物一米，柚木，錫和樹膠一之外，沒有受到十分嚴厲的制裁。去年十二月　故皇由瑞士返國，　比里辭退攝政，人民議會乃決議給以「元老」的頭銜，他達到道樣崇高的地位，可是他的年紀只不過是四十七歲左右。　比里在幕後操縱暹羅政治，本年春間遇到首次反抗，一個素以坦白直率誠實民主著稱的政變份子一　阿派旺一聯合一部份其他的政變份十，起而反對　比里，說他「不民主」，攻擊他爲獨裁」，結果在三月間　比里從幕後出來，正面負起執政責任，出任國務院長，　寬却和他的同志組織「民主黨」，在人民議會席上站在反對地位，本年五月初，暹羅新憲法頒布，人民議會由一院制改爲兩院制，選舉上議院職員，　比里派得到壓倒的勝利，上議院議員幾全部是他所領導的政變份子。六月間進　暴崩，人民都認爲被弒，紛紛責難政府，　比里仍然是國務院長，就成爲一般攻擊目標，「民主黨乘機活動，作反　此里行動，　比里用高壓手段對付，他最先宣布全國在「緊急時期」，接着實施新聞檢査，　制譽論，拘捕反政府」的新聞記者，甚至人民代表有及政府嫌疑的亦遭拘捕，動盪局面才漸趨平靜。　比里雖然原籍中國、但對祖國並無認識，對於暹羅華僑沒有好感，去年九月暹軍警在曼谷慘殺華僑，僑領數人往　比里處抗議，他非特不說暹羅軍警行動爲非法，却反說華僑不對。他這次訪華，有很好機會使他明知我們對暹羅是怎樣的好感，中國人是怎樣的寬大和容忍，我們對於退羅絕沒有領土或其他一切的野心。</p>

<h3 id="c37">會見克夫人　她說：對黃河堵口工程很感興趣　希望「中國之憂」變成「中國之樂」 <a href="#c37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>〔本報鄭州二日電〕克利浦斯夫人於一日自延安飛抵鄭州。從香港算起，她已在中國大陸上旅行了一萬七千華里。她特別到鄭州來看看著名的黄河，留鄭兩日，冒天着彌風沙，先後去花園口和中牟港口。他對記者說：對於黄河的堵口工程，頗感興趣，希望這被稱爲「China＇s　Sorrow」：（中國之憂）的黄河，將來能成爲「China＇s　Joy」（中國之樂）。在花園口，她曾坐中國木船，横渡黄河到北岸去，他的同行者克洛絲小姐，在搭船時跌了一交，從高岸上滑踢到河灘，絲襪扯破，皮破血流。這古老的黄河，在陽光下閃爍着銀鱗，汨汨東流，默默無語，克利浦斯夫人也默默無語。當她從太原飛延安的時候，一路陪他旅行的中國人，都停止在大原等地，幷鄭途中，在新鄕機塲停留了半小時，這是日軍在黄河邊上所建的最大機塲。</p>
<p>她己有六十四歲，許多人讚美他的精神好。據說，蔣夫人十分關懷她，願意她不必在長途旅行中應付煩雜的招待塲面。昨晚七時半，劉茂恩主席具柬邀宴她，出席了這宴會，由豫省社會處長李鴻音代表劉茂恩主持，大家默默的吃了一個鐘頭。</p>
<p>她在今天上午八時半正式的見記者，先由她和英國援華會秘書密勒夫人向記者說了一遍援華會過去的工作，然後讓記者提問題。記者的第二個問題還沒有提出，她就說因爲時間匆促，希望記者頂多再提兩個問題，作五分鐘的談話，她深沉莊重，充分表現了英國人的性格。她對記者說：她在中國旅行，學習，正在吸取印象，無論「左」「右」，都有接觸，因爲援華會過去的工作，也是這樣，不採取政治態度的。她在延安的時候，對於該地的農業方面甚感興趣，然而無諭如何，目前還不能明確發表觀感，爲的是外國人到中國不過幾天，就發表見解，那是最危險不過的事。關於延安設立醫院，對於各方的諒解，表示感謝，至於這醫院辦得不好，則無法和別處比較，由干設備和別的條件不能用一個標準來衡量它的好壞。她繼續對記者說，和有一點可以說的，就是中國人民目前正陷於非常悲慘的境地，希望各方有忍耐心，和平是有希望的。說完了不發表意見的意見之後，就和記者吿別，準備啓車到中牟渡口去，再看黄河。記者追上去，想問一句直接有關中英友誼的話，但她已跑進他的房間去了。回過頭來，看她的女兒佩琪小姐，她坐在椅子上，記錄着他母親的談話，執行着私人秘書的任務。她一路勤勤懇懇，爲她母親寫日記，在飛行途中，也把打字機擱在滕上，利用時間努力寫作。</p>

<h3 id="c38">不可忽視的朝鮮問題 <a href="#c38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>朝鮮南部民主協會日昨向聯合國大會呼籲，提出三項要求：（一）立即實施開羅宣言及波茨坦宣言，確保朝鮮之自由與獨立；（二）美蘇兩國駐軍立即自朝鮮撤退；（三）准許朝鮮臨時政府加入聯合國機構爲會員國，得與蘇聯直接進行談判，討論取消美蘇兩國佔領區之分界綫問題以及蘇軍撤退問題。</p>
<p>朝鮮，過去是中國的屛藩，現在是中國的鄰國，將來吏必是中國志同道合的友邦，所以中國對於朝鮮過去的不幸遭遇，一向表示同情，而對於朝鮮未來的命運，尤其關切。朝鮮致函聯合國大會稱：「將朝鮮劃分爲兩個佔領區，實爲對世界和平的一種直接威脅」。這一句警語，我們不僅有同感，而且還希望美蘇兩國佔領當局能撇除成見，高瞻遠矚，庶幾可以體認朝鮮人士呼聲的正確性。</p>
<p>朝鮮是亞洲最大的半島，突出於日本海與黄海之商，適居於中日蘇三國的中間，形成了她在戰略上的重要地位。近四十年來，日本帝國主義者一直利用朝鮮，作爲踏入亞洲大陸的跳板，並曾企圖以此作爲進攻蘇聯的基地。伹是經過這次大戰之後，窮兵續武的侵略者終於屈膝投降，卒使亡國已久的朝鮮，解脫了日本軍閥統治的枷銷。朝鮮從此獲得解放，由殖民地一躍而爲亞洲獨立自由的民主國家，本該是沒有絲毫問題的；但因命運的擺佈，日本專斷的統治崩潰之後，相繼而來的乃是美蘇的分治，以人爲的方法，硬把整個不可分割的朝鮮國劃分爲南北兩部，受美蘇兩國佔領當局的統治，以致在一國之內，成了兩個世界，至今還沒有獲得統一與獨立！</p>
<p>回想起大戰期間，朝鮮的人民在日本軍閥統治之下，雖然暗無天日，嘗盡亡國的苦味，但是聽到聯合國領袖迭次發表「作戰目標」如大西洋憲章所標榜的民族自由之類，終覺得朝鮮的前途將有無限光明，一俟日本戰敗之後，朝鮮當即可以獲得解放。例如在一九四一年八月間羅邱二巨頭在大西洋某處會晤時發表宣言稱：「英美尊章各民族有自有決完其所賴以生存的政治形式之權利；在各民族中，如有被剝奪此項權利者，則兩國均欲使其恢復原有的主權與自治權。」再如一九四三年十二月間羅邱蔣三巨頭在開羅開會後發表宣言稱：「中英美三國作戰之目的，乃在剝奪日本自一九一四年第一次大戰開始以後在太平洋上所奪得或佔領之一切島嶼，並剝奪日本所竊取於中國之領土，例如滿洲·台灣·嘭湖羣烏等均應歸還中國。此外，日本亦將被逐出於其以武力或貪婪所攫取之土地。中英美三國爲軫念朝鮮人民所受之奴隷待遇起見，乃決定在相當時間，應使朝鮮獲得自由與獨立。」這些皇皇國際文吿，使一般生活在水火中的朝鮮人民都獲得無限溫暖，在他們的眼前，都閃鑠着一議希望的明燈。及至納粹德國無條件投降後，勝利在望，朝鮮人民更加樂觀了，尤其是英美蘇三國領袖所發表的波茨坦宜霄，給朝鮮人民更大的興奮與衝動。因爲蘇聯對於朝鮮的態度，以前從來沒有鮮明的表示，伹這波茨坦宣言裏也鄭重聲明：「開羅宣言之條文，應予以實施。」蘇聯旣已簽署波茨姐宣言，自然也就參加了國際對於刺鮮獨立所提供的保證。這在朝鮮人民看來，波茨坦宣言是何等的神聖，何等的値得慶幸呀！</p>
<p>但是到了日本屈膝投降之後，朝鮮人民渴望國際諾言見諸事實之際，却突然發生了波折。因爲在大戰吿終之後，過去駢肩作戰的盟國，竟爲了利害的衝突，而似乎處於相互猜忌的地位了。對德奧的間題，姑置勿論，僅以遠東而言，美蘇不僅在中國間題上似有若感意見的出入，而且在朝鮮也發生了磨擦，使遠東的天際，陰霾未净，大有山雨欲來之勢。後來幸賴美國國務卿貝爾納斯首倡對蘇妥協的論調，親自到莫斯科去，與莫洛托夫外長曁英國外相貝文，舉行三國外長會議，除了對德問題成立協議而外，對於朝鮮問題，也商得一個妥協辦法：（一）設立朝鮮臨時政府，以發展其農工業及其民族文化；（二）由朝鮮南部美國佔領軍當局與朝鮮北部蘇聯佔領軍當局，組成聯合委員會；（三）朝鮮由中英美蘇四强託管，爲期五年，期滿後許其獨立；（四）美蘇兩國佔領當局應切實合作，並應立即舉行會議，討論各種緊急問題，獲致解決辦決。</p>
<p>朝鮮人民聽到了莫斯科三國外長會議的宣言，好比晴天霹　，殊出意外。因此一般愛國的人民，於失望之餘，便在國內發起反對託管五年辦法的民衆運動，悲壯熱烈，如火如荼，迄今未已。此在美蘇方面，雖然也知道朝鮮人民的願望及其在美蘇分治下的痛古，但是雙方的意見，不啻南轅北轍，實在無法接近。美蘇兩國佔領當局雖一再進行談判，討論這兩個佔領區在政治上經濟上實行合併的問題，俾使朝鮮國內不復有兩個世界的存在，可是談判到了本年五月六日，就陷於破裂的邊綠，無法繼續下去，至今還沒有恢復談判。</p>
<p>朝鮮人民所懷抱的願望，固然非常明顯，而且也十分簡單；一言以蔽之，就是反對五年託管的辦法，而要求立即成立臨時政府，以實現韓人自治的願望。蘇聯方向，則堅持着莫斯科三國外長會議的決議，將朝鮮交四强託管五年，然後許其獨立；同時又在朝鮮北部蘇軍佔領區內，張起一幕堅厚的鐵幕，不容許外界人士獲悉朝鮮北部的實際情形，更不讓美蘇兩佔領區有什麽往來。蘇聯　舉動，儼然使朝鮮成了兩個世界，朝鮮人民自更感到國家已被肢解的痛苦，益加迫切地要求國家的獨立與自由。至於在美軍佔領區內，霍琪將軍的管制，的確非常高明，頗能獲得朝鮮人民的擁護，但其管制朝鮮南部唯一的目標，乃在防制蘇聯勢力的南侵，伸入朝鮮南部，所以也始終沒有辦法，能與蘇聯成立妥協，使朝鮮「復歸於統一」。</p>
<p>要而言之，今日的朝鮮，已成爲美蘇兩國勢力角逐的舞台了。由朝鮮人民的觀點而論，不僅對於獨立的前途，益感渺茫，而且對於自身所處地位，也更加覺得危險萬分。美蘇在朝鮮所採取的政策，如盯再不加以修改，則雙方猜忌，難免愈演愈烈，而不測之禍也許竟會有降臨的一天。所以朝鮮南部民主協會說：「朝鮮劃分爲兩個佔領區，實爲對世界和平的一種直接威脅」，我們完全同感，而且希望成功湖畔的聯合國大會，對於朝鮮人民的呼聲，不可置若罔聞。間時，四國外長會議今日在紐約舉行，對於此一間題，亦應加以討論，因爲朝鮮的如何安排，實在不應我們忽視的。</p>

<p>— 本報資料室</p>
<p>這個問題說來話長，我們且先叙一叙它的源流歷史。「託管」二字最早見諸於羅馬法中，但作近代意義的大規模的實施，則始於第一次世界大戰以後。那時德國和土耳其戰敗了，戰勝國對它們留下來的一些殖民地如何處置，覺得頗費躊躇。給與它們獨立吧？道些殖民地在政治經濟和文化等各方面都還够不上水準，如果貿然予以自主，結果恐反將爲强鄰覬覦的目標，貽日後無窮的禍息。考慮再三，乃於凡爾賽和會中決定把這些殖民地作爲「委任統治地」，通過國際聯盟，託付給一個適當的强國代管，有如一個保姆之照料嬰孩。委任統治制有目標，有方策，担任統治的國家並須竭力設法幫助這殖民地在各方面能够獨立自主，並將進步的情形隨時報告國際聯盟。一俟這殖民地能够獨立自主了，嬰兒長大成了，担任統治的國家方吿任務終了，讓它獨立。在道個辦法下，担任委任統治的國家有英·法·澳·南非聯邦·紐西蘭·比利時和日本。被統治的殖民地，亦眞有能够獨立自主了的，例如伊拉克，即在一九三二年正式宣吿獨立了。但大部分的殖民地則被担任統治的國家常作私產，攫在手裏不放了。</p>
<p>道次大戰結束，軸心國戰敗，它們所留下來的殖民地和舊委任統治地如何解決，自然又成了頗爲棘手的問題。很自然地，大家就想到了和委任統治相彷彿的「託管」辦法。</p>
<p>國際託管制度係規定於聯合國憲章第十一·十二·及十三章中。這些部分當初在舊金山會議中討論之際，眞是絞盡了專家代表們的腦汁心血，一字一句之爭，時常要辯論到好幾個禮拜。由此，也可見這件事情是何等的重要了！</p>
<p>一九四四四年八月鄧巴頓橡樹會議時，美國方面本即擬提出關於國際託管制度的辦法，但因爲那時蘇聯還沒有對日本宣戰，所以太平洋上的一些託管問題此時如果討論。將來定必仍要引起麻煩，於是會中就根本未曾提出。直到次年二月克里米亞三巨頭會議時，才正式討論到了託管問題。</p>
<p>不過克里米亞會議也並未曾討論到實際問題，而抵不過談到了一此原則，大略如下：（一）三強應於五月間在舊金山會議中提出意見一致的託管辦法；（二）託管應包括現有的委任統治地，戰後敵國的殖民地，以及其他國家自願交付託管的領土；（三）託管領土的詳細分配，在舊金山會議中暫不討論。按這最後一點，自然還是爲了太平洋上的基地問題，因爲那時蘇聯還沒有對日宣戰，不便討論。</p>
<p>舊金山會議中，費盡了九牛二虎之力，總算在憲章中把國際託管制度的條文通過了。美國提出的草案中，對太平洋上的基地劃出了一些轉殊的「戰略防區」，這一點結果雖仍通過，但討論時曾大受蘇聯代表的反對。一九四五年六月廿六日，聯合國憲章終於簽字成立。國際託管制度的辦法，就包括在憲章之中。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕上海美術協會，最近假南京東路慈淑大樓四樓星五餐廳舉行孫靑羊畫展。根據孫伏園氏的意見，孫的作品是「內慧外樸，技巧之純熟，爲近來國內所僅見。以火熱的心，有力的筆，作時代的寫眞，傳人類的共鳴。」</p>
<p>這次孫氏所展覽的作品有國畫，水彩畫，素描和油畫四類。孫氏的國畫，無論人物山水，筆意仍保守傳統的風致，唯渲染方面，體量使其合乎立體的透視。孫氏所畫的馬，極得好評，普通國畫中的馬，不是身段太短，就是馬腿太長。孫氏的馬，筆法古拙，同時比例合乎解剖，這應歸功於西洋畫的根底。這次展覽中的「南海東山，」「玉虎牽絲汲井迴，」都是少見的好畫。</p>
<p>水彩畫極難畫，因爲着筆不好改。孫氏的水彩畫有寫景，更多感時的作品。千字文水彩畫就是。這是用千字文的文句，一一加以新的解說，使於現實社會情形密合，然後構成一幅幅畫面，以表現出社會種種現象。此外「故事新畫，」也是用古人古事，如卓文君，壽陽公主，垓下之圍等，來表現一種新意識。</p>
<p>總而言之，孫靑羊氏的作品，有深入淺出之妙，藝術大家當然認爲不凡，販夫走卒也能欣賞。</p>

<p>市公用局爲統籌本市水陸交通，以期配合大上海都市計劃總岡起見，除積極籌備市輪渡公司外，復將原有之公共汽車委員會及電車籌備處兩單位，合併成立上海市交通公司籌備會，專司調配及計劃組織上海市陸上交通網。據悉交通公司之初步計劃，於三月內儘量設法增闢市區及郊區之公共汽車，俾與法商公共汽車相接啣，完成全市公共汽車之交通網。第二步工作計劃尙未確定，大致爲整頓路權，電車及公共汽車之行駛權。査英商公共汽車之行駛權，雖尙有年月，然該公司之車輛已損毁無遺，迄今尙未恢復，現公用局已限於本月底前恢復，否則其行駛權將收歸市有。至英商電車公司之行駛權，將於明年十月九日滿期，最近市參議會曾建議收歸市有，市府亦曾計劃收買該公司所有資產，至於法商電車公司及公共汽車之行駛權，尙有數年，是否將提前收回行駛權，該局正縝密考慮中云。</p>
<p>本市中區交通，自於本年九九實行改善，在規定時間內，車輛肇禍事件已漸减少，茲悉市公用局鑒於南京路，北京路兩處，於傍晚五時許各機關及寫字間休息後，西行車輛倍形擁擠，現該局已籌備再行改善辦法，以解決該兩路交通之困難，聞上項問題將提交最近交通會議討論。</p>

<p>〔本報特寫〕從皮裘業老闆們的一片訴苦經中，正可窺出這金玉其外的病態都市，心窩深處正蘊育着一顆工商不景氣的癌！</p>
<p>本來，天時已寒該是添置冬裘的時候了·可是，各皮貨店的櫃面交易，還是門可羅雀。據說拋球塲幾家皮裘業的大同行，每天的門市營業額，不過二三百萬元。這是都市的兒女們，忘了學時髦麽？不像！</p>
<p>且聽皮裘業的老闆們打開天窗說亮話。他們說：今年天氣熱得長，是個「近因」。遠因是今年市面各業，十九蕭條。以前叱咤風雲的投機事業，又吿一一消聲歛跡。發財的行業旣沒有，那來主顧呢？</p>
<p>再說：皮裘業的本身，吃本重，高利貸的威脅，姑置不談。而每年可以營業的時間，不過夏曆十，十一，十二，三個月。一年的盈利得失，全看這一季。據他們多年的統計：要添新裘的人們，都趕在夏曆年關前備好。一過夏曆新正，任你春寒料峭，新裘就乏人問津了！他們的生意眼裏，已敏感到這一年來不景氣的市面，好像已預示了他們這一季營業慘淡的徵兆！</p>
<p>皮毛種類和產地</p>
<p>記者不願使話題儘往苦悶中下沉，於是又扯到毛皮本身的問題上去。老闆們於是如數家珍的點出毛皮的種類　　地來。選犖犖大者說，南方有雲南的虎的，水獺，點貓，獾皮·貴州與浙江有白擔。北方有甘肅，新疆，蒙古，察哈爾的羊皮，狐皮。東北一地，尤爲出產毛皮的溫床。據說：所產有灰鼠，黃狼，貉，狐，貂等皮種。</p>
<p>皮裘在上海服裝的遞　史上，着實也有說不盡的滄桑。過去在專制的帝王時代，皮裘被且爲貴族之品。穿皮也分了等級。某種人只准穿某種皮，要是越了級，不但爲官府所不許，就是在自夥中，亦將被訕笑。當時還有什麽「一品玄狐，二品貂，三品四品穿倭刀」的說法。曾幾何時，民主的在潮，捲去這一切時代的殘渣。皮裘給「平民化」到一般經濟有辦法的人身上來。接着歐風東漸，先生們似乎比小姐們更敏感些。十年來，西服普遍盛行起來。穿慣西服的先生們，禦冬的衣服，多捨笨重的皮裘，而取厚呢大衣。就是穿大掛的，也都愛穿輕暖的絲棉袍，再罩上件馬褲呢之類的夾大衣。這無形中减少了皮裘的需要。皮裘業因此而遭受的打擊，是够嚴重的。</p>
<p>全賴小姐們撑腰</p>
<p>可是，失之東隅，收之桑楡。千幸萬幸，近四五年來，都市的小姐們，也未甘洛後。她們在服裝上，也效先生們染上了歐化的風氣。這年代，一個穿西服長褲的女郞在街上走，決不會被人目爲怪物。於是，禦寒的大衣，當然也不能例好。記得以前的女大衣，大都是用呢絨或甚致毛葛料子爲面。就是做襲皮大衣，那毛皮的一面，總是做裏子的多。可是，歐美的時髦女士，偏愛把毛皮的一面，做在外邊。於是，這種皮大衣，從四五年前開始琉行到近兩年已經盛極一時了！有錢的娘兒們，找她們的丈夫，或正在熱烈地追求她的男士，上時裝店定上件把。家道小康的女兒們，縱使沒法央人做，也會瞞上爸媽，到箱裏發掘一件爸爸的舊皮裘，交給時裝店裏的裁縫們「妙手回春」一下，只要毛皮翻在外邊，不也就是襲雍容華貴儀　萬千的皮大衣。時髦小姐們這股愛美的蠻勁，終算替目前不景氣的皮裘業，做了個撑腰人。　不得皮裘業的老闆們，見了娘兒們上櫃面選購皮大衣，終要笑逐顏開，招待唯恐不週。</p>
<p>據老闆們說：上海皮裘的幾種大路貨（意即最盛銷者），是權皮，貓皮，白楣，及羊皮。而這幾種毛皮最大的去處，就是做翻皮的女大衣。其他像玄狐，白狐，灰背，豹皮，貂皮之類，雖也有採製爲女大衣的，但銷數究屬有限。</p>
<p>貓皮價漲得最多</p>
<p>談到各貨的市價，老闆們不由撥動算盤珠。據說：各種皮貨，平均較戰前漲起四五千倍。假使單獨舉例講起來，當以貴族皮貨玄狐白狐等所漲最微，只有戰前的千倍。可是出人意料的是，以前皮毛中最廉賤的貓皮，所漲的倍數却最高，計漲的一萬倍。記者不禁懷疑起這句話的眞諦來。老闆們却說得好：貓皮大都取自家貓身上。年來人工大昻，一方貓皮從剝洗硝製到拚凑成裘，正不知要花費多少工銀。再說年來烽火遍野，飢莩載道，人都吃不飽肚子，誰來餘力豢貓。貓兒少了，貓皮也少了，皮價當然也接翁漲。這句話，包含着多少辛酸。</p>
<p>吿訴你，時髦的先生小姐們！目前皮貨的代價，先生們的一襲皮裘，做白羊皮的；每件自二十萬至三十萬元。灰鼠皮的，每件自五十萬至一百萬元。狐皮的每件約七八十萬元。比較名貴的細狐皮袍，每件約一百五六十萬元。其他像希有的紫貂皮，因爲產自俄國，上海存貨不多，價也奇昻。大家就有件把，也都當作古董般的賣出買進。聽說市價每件自二三百萬元起，至八百餘萬元止。</p>
<p>白猸的銷路最廣</p>
<p>小姐們的翻皮大衣，最普銷的白楣大衣，每件自七八十萬元至一百二三十萬元。貓皮大衣，每件自四十萬元至六十萬元。點貓皮大衣，每件自五十萬元至七十萬元。染色年皮大衣，每件自四十萬元至六十藝元。權皮大衣，每件自五十萬元至七八十萬元。較名貴的黃狼，玄狐，灰背，豹皮等大衣，市價每件約在一百萬元至二百萬元之間。</p>
<p>從上面的市價中，可以看出同一種貨品，市價起迄的幅度很大。這正說明了毛皮種類的繁複，同一種類的貨品，因毛的鬆密緊懈，槍毛之長短，毛的色澤，每襲皮裘所用的隻數，剝洗硝製工程的繁簡，皮裘尺寸之大小，而有上落。這些想來決不是穿皮裘的兒女們所會關注到的。</p>
<p>末了，老闆們又搬出他們精確的估計，他們說：目前皮裘業中所做的生意，三分之二强全靠小姐們的翻皮大衣，先生們皮裘所能作成的生意經，還不到三分之一。去年勝利初臨，照說八年長期抗戰，一旦氣復蘇，正可買件新裘慶祝勝利新年。可是說也悽慘，去年一冬，拋球塲上五家大同行裘業的營業總額，也不過三億元。這是怎樣渺小的一個數字！說到這裏，老闆們又恢復了他們開頭的那套訴苦經。苦雖苦，倒也有它不可抹殺的事實在。例如說。在戰前幹他們這一行業的，大大小小一共有卅四家。八年戰爭，毛皮的來源都給遮斷了。毛皮之不存，皮裘業其將焉附。終於關的關了，歇的歡了，凄凄凉凉的剩下目前大小的十一家。更不幸的是，連這僅有的十一家皮毛業，也有不勝目前百業蕭條之脅逼。時髦的兒女們，你們有動於中吾？他們正眼巴巴地，佇候着你伸過一隻溫暖的手去，給予同情的拯助！</p>

<p>關於本市工人生活指數之計算，自市府派生活指數編製室代表周世述前往市總工會講述該項指數計算方法後，各業工會代表紛紛向市總工會提出詢問及建議，歸納七項，詳情已見報載，査該項建議，經由市總工會轉呈市府，並於昨日接獲市府復文如下：「據陳第二項（在指數表食品類中取消黃豆麥粞提高蕪秈品質）爲顧全營養觀點言，米質碾白，對於營養反爲有損，糙米之營養價値，遠勝品質優良之白粳，所請應毋庸議，至其餘各項建議，已交有關部份硏討，以備採擇。」</p>

<h3 id="c104">上海路名考 <a href="#c104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>我們在上海天空，鳥瞰這世界大都市，稠密的房屋，有許多馬路分隔着，好如一張棋盤，也許更密一些。這許多從横的動脈，交織而造成上海的繁榮。一個從後方復員歸來的人，雖是「老上海，但見到這許多路名，也會感覺到陌生，因爲已經過了</p>
<p>一番大更改。在敵僞統治時，上海路名，曾更改過一次，勝利以後，敵僞雷下的殘跡，當然不能讓他留存下去，而以前老路名，又不適用，是以再改一次，可以說是三易其名了。上海路名，單獨更改，已不止一次，不過這兩次是澈底的更換，所以大家特別注意。可是這許多新路名，大家還沒有牢牢記往，電車到站，售票員仍喚着舊路名，雇人力車，假使用新路名，車夫會膛目不知所對。習慣使然，推行尙需時日。</p>
<h3 id="c105">道路別名 <a href="#c105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>上海有許多地方，名稱是莫明其妙的，在地圖上也找不出來。這許多道路的俗名，往往使初到上海的人，手足無措。現在把他們對列如下，以資參考。（俗稱）　（舊路名）石路福建路　大新街湖北路小花園、浙江路廣西路漢　口路一帶</p>
<h3 id="c106">石路得名之由來 <a href="#c106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>這條衣莊薈集的福建路，俗稱石路，這是什麼綠故呢？三十年前，上海馬路，除南京路和四川路坩火磚或鐵黎木不　成外，其餘都是用沙和石子拌和而成的，此外便是大小碎石砌疊而成的石路。常租界初開埠時，居民用水，都在洋涇浜和蘇州河中汲取，早晚兩潮上漲，相率而往，洋涇浜上的打狗橋，鄭家木橋，蘇州河上的珊記碼頭等處，均爲取水要道。那裏附近的道路，全用碎石砌成，旣可防汲水者之傾滑，又可免道路因水淋二坍壞。福建路因連接南北兩水道，全用碎石片砌成，因此得名。</p>
<p>另外又有一種傳說。在淸道光年間，城內縣署東首，住着一家姓李的鉅富。他那位千金嫁給老閘橋北堍的瞿家爲婦，瞿家也是富室，可謂門當戶對。這時租界未闢，城外道路崎嶇，阡陌縱横，行走非常不便。李氏因置備大石數千方，雇人從洋涇浜舖起，沿着福建路，一直向北，舖至老闡橋爲止，每隔咫尺，即舖一塊，使他女兒出閣，豐廠的妝奩送去時，較爲方便。從此以後，即有石路之名，也可說是「豪舉」了。</p>
<p>又有人謂石路當作閘路，閘指老閘云。</p>
<h3 id="c107">蓬路得來源 <a href="#c107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>在北火車站前面，那條華洋分界的馬路，以前稱爲界路界路的前身是文監師路，又稱蓬路，這是照英文的讀音譯出來的。</p>
<p>文監師路在英文何以叫做落逢路呢，道是有來歷的。</p>
<p>當時有位美國聖公會的主敎，姓逢名惠廉，因常和中國人接觸的關係，所以另外取了一個道地的中國姓名，叫做文惠廉。自從英法先後開闢租界之後，美國人看了十分欣羨，也希望有一塊租界。文惠廉那時要在虹口建造教堂，便向上海道交涉，上海道於一八四八年泛指虹口一帶爲美僑居留區，所以文惠廉實在是美租界的創始人。</p>
<p>這樣一個有功於租界歷史的重要人物，自然非把他的各字搬到路上，作爲紀念不可。英文名字仍叫「蓬路」，中文則用他的中國姓氏，主敎從前譯作監師，就成爲「文監師路」了。但這中文名字看來多少有點莫名其妙，而且英文名字讀起來又很簡便，所以大家喚作「蓬路」。平日不大走勁的朋友，要找蓬路是萬找不到的。蓬路今改稱爲天目路</p>
<p>白昇樓　浙江路南京路</p>

<h3 id="c108">新名路　是怎樣改題的？ <a href="#c108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>上海路名，在租界時期，全是從西文翻　過來的，　上去旣不順口，又不易記，有些還帶點「洋氣」。太平洋事變發生以後，敵僞進駐租界，改換路名。勝利以後，敵偽殘　，在所必去，而恢復　名，也覺不妥，所以又更改了一次。</p>
<p>這次政府改換路名，是將市區中心劃成一個田字。中山路團統於外，中正路縱横貫穿之。中山路原從龍華起，向西向北，　蜓而達閘北，這次將黄浦　路改爲中山東路，裏馬路康衢路改爲中山南路，便與原中山路接　，成爲一大圓圈。其間雖尙有缺口一段，但已將市區積華，幾乎完全包括進去了。</p>
<p>在這圓圈的中央，再劃兩條縱橫的幹綫。白東向西的原爲愛多亞路福煦路和大西路。這又長又寬的這路，自是上海的主要通　，改稱爲中正東路，中路，西路。自南市北的原爲金神父路，聖母院路，同孚路和卡得路，改稱爲中正南路，北路。</p>
<p>「一元化」爲改名的原則。凡兩三條路相連接的，一律改成統一的名稱，而以東西南北等字樣分則之。東西的路，將原寗波路（前法租界）霞飛路，陸家路合併爲林森路，原　嘉路，辣斐德路，白棄中路合併爲復興路，原康悌路，薛華立路，福履理路合併爲建國路，原靜安寺路改稱爲南京西路，原愛文義路改稱爲北京西路。由南而北的也是如此，而且有很好的界綫來劃分爲南路，中路，和北路，即蘇州河和過去公共租界與法租界的界綫是也。凡西藏路以東各路，在蘇州河以北的爲北路，在前法租界的爲南路，在前公共租界的爲巾路。仍依前公共租界例，以中國地名爲名。</p>
<p>新改路名，其中大部分以地名爲主，但有少數是例外的。中山中正林森各路情爲人名。薩坡賽路改爲英士路，是紀念先烈陳英士的，因爲英士先生的故居，正在薩坡賽路上。</p>
<h3 id="c109">路名的分類 <a href="#c109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>上海路名，大致可分爲幾類。（一）用中國省名地名的，這最容易記，從前公共租界中區德馬路都是如此，像南京路，九江路，漢口路，浙江路，江西路之類。虹口閘北一帶有許多。（二）因建築物而得名的，像靜安寺路以靜安寺而得名，公館馬路以法領事館而得名，菜市路鄰近小菜塲，愚園路地臨愚園。（三）沿出舊地名的，像小沙渡路因通小沙澱，徐家匯路因通徐家匯情是。</p>
<p>上海路名，幾乎有一半以上用外國名字，大都是人名，包括駐華外交官，駐滬領事，旅滬敎士僑商，前工都局和公董局的董事等靜，直接或間接，和上海發生過關係。</p>
<p>用外國地名爲路名的，不很多見，像東京路，合灣路，現在已不能列入外國地名之例，還有香港路澳門路等等，也不能算是外國地名。</p>
<p>用中國人名題作路名的也很少。寥寥可數，因爲過去租界是在外僑掌握之中，不把中國人放在眼內。這僅有的幾條，也因特別關係，才肯把他們的名字放到路牌上去。</p>
<h3 id="c110">霞飛路 <a href="#c110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>這條被人認爲神秘繁榮的霞飛路，是富有詩意的，同時也頗有歷史的意味。</p>
<p>霞飛路原爲前法租界越界築路之一。至民國三年第三次擴充租界後，遂正式劃入界內。此路東自　體　　路，　　　　，至海格路止，計長五千五百公尺，爲前法租界最長而又最直的一條路，今稱林森中路。</p>
<p>霞飛路原名寳昌路。「寳昌」兩字是前法公董局董事的名字。他從一八八一年起，至一九〇七年止，接連選任至十七次，又做過六次總理。霞飛路是一九〇〇年才決定興建，至一九〇一年完成。這時寳昌正榮任總董，所以就把此路稱爲寳昌路。</p>
<p>第一次歐戰時，法國東路軍總司令以瑪納一戰，救了垂亡的法國，這是很偉大的戰績。霞飛在一八八五年曾到過上海，那時他僅是一個　周得工兵士官，因這一段淵源，所以前法租界當局，便把這最重要最繁盛的寳昌路，改名爲霞飛路。當時霞飛將軍在戎馬惚倥之中，還特地來函申謝。歐戰終了，霞飛將軍於一九二二年三月九日特來上海觀光，其時霞飛路上，頗有一番盛况，霞飛路之名也在是日正式宣布。</p>
<p>因寳昌服務租界至十七年之久而得名的寳昌路，從此便成爲歷史上的陳迹。在霞飛路白賽仲路麥琪路的岔道間，有一方三角地，於一九二〇年間闢爲公園，名曰寳昌公園，作爲替代的紀念品，現也改爲迪化兒童公國了。</p>
<h3 id="c111">洋涇改造的「愛多亞路」　河舖路工程費時二年有餘 <a href="#c111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>塡浜築路，是上海開埠後外人的第一件德政。在百年前這一塊滿佈着河　水溝的土地，現在都已改了樣子，最寬闊的那條愛多亞路，就是把洋涇浜改建而成的。</p>
<p>洋涇浜源是一條小水浜，僞舊英法兩租界的分界綫。在自來水尙未普通使用以前，此浜與蘇州河皆居民取水之所。但汚穢不堪，糞船柴船，　集浜中，夏日經過其地，莫不掩鼻而過。</p>
<p>最初所謂三茅閣橋，鄭家木橋，西新橋等，都是破舊木橋。後來英法兩租界於一八五六年，計劃在洋涇浜上，建造一座溝通兩租界外灘的橋。道橋於一八五六年三月廿五日造成，計長六十九呎，寬三十呎，有三個橋洞，全部用新加坡木料建造，橋的兩頭，則用花岡石，共費洋二千餘元。</p>
<p>至一九一四年，兩租界覺得這條臭水浜實無存在的必要，便決定塡塞，改爲馬路。這塡河舖路的工程，共費二年多的時間，至一九一六年才完成。在未建馬路以前，洋涇浜沿岸，最早的名稱爲洋涇浜灘路後又改爲松江路。迨馬路完成，才改稱愛多亞路，即今中正東路，這是用英皇愛德華七世的名字，因照法文的發音和拚法，故變爲愛多亞。</p>
<p>洋徑浜　塞後，還發生過一段出浦水面的交涉。照租界約章，舊英租界以洋涇浜爲南界，舊法租界以洋涇浜爲北界，那末洋涇浜河道並不在央法租界之內。民國十一年夏，浦東善後塘工局提議將洋涇浜口作爲渡輪碼頭，未得前兩租界當局同意，計劃未能實現。至民國二十三年春，市公用局再與前工部局磋商，結果由前工部局將北京路外灘原有十五號碼頭向南遷移，騰出適當岸線，讓與市渡輪建造碼頭之用，此即現在的市輪渡碼頭。</p>
<p>洋涇浜的上游，原名北長浜，後繼愛多亞路而改爲馬路，初名大西路，又名長浜路，乃因浜得名。第一次歐戰時，法國陸軍上將　熙　有功績，乃將長　路改名爲福煦路，即今中正東路。</p>
<h3 id="c112">太平天國時　留下來得紀念 <a href="#c112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>上海有三條馬路，是與太平天國的史事有關係的，此即徐家匯路海格路（即今華山路）和戈登路（即今江寗路）一八六〇年太平軍擊敗包圍南京之淸軍，接着下常州，攻蘇州，上海大震。上海道吳煦一面請英法駐軍援助防守，一面又雇用美人華爾，組織洋人軍隊，後來稱爲常勝軍。</p>
<p>是年八月十七日，太平軍進展至徐家匯，駐紮該地的法軍廿五名已經撤退，上海陷入戰爭狀態。爲行軍便利起見，開始築一軍用大道，由上海縣城西門，沿方浜橋以通徐家匯，即現在的徐家匯路便是。後來華爾所統率的常勝軍，也築了一條路，自蘇州河沿岸起，經法華鎭而達徐家匯。迨兵事結束，前工部局時加修理，便把靜安寺至徐家匯一段也稱爲徐家匯路。一九一四年，舊法租界擴展至徐家匯，這條路的南段，便成爲華法兩界的界路。第一次歐戰結束，因紀念英將海格戰時功績，自一九二一年起，改稱海格路。</p>
<p>戈登</p>
<p>在當時爲英駐軍參謀，一八六二年太平軍第三次攻上海時，協助李鴻章攻克上海縣城，相繼收復崑山，松江，蘇州等地，頗有功績，事平之後，乃以戈登題作路名，以資紀念。</p>
<p>賈西義乃一艘法國軍艦之名，於一八五三年春駛抵上海，時値太平軍進攻甫京，上海道欲借以開赴南京，助淸兵作戰，因法領事敏體尼蔭不允而罷。事雖未成，但此法國軍艦之名，却已留下，作爲上海的路名了。</p>
<h3 id="c113">愛而考克路　紀念感情最惡德英領事 <a href="#c113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>在虹口有一條「愛而老克路」，現在已經改稱爲安國路了。這條路從華德路監獄所在之處起，向北稍稍偏西，可以直達岳州路的東端，靠近前公共租界界綫爲止，路不很長，而且也算不得十分重要。但從前公共租界的歷史上看來，却也很有關係。</p>
<p>愛而考克是英國駐滬第二任領事，於一八四六年接事。在較舊一點的書上，譯作阿利國　任後，曾做過許多潑辣的事件。</p>
<p>現在黄浦灘外白渡橋畔，乃英領事署所在地，購買基地，發動於第一任英領事巴爾福，可是蕭規曹隨，繼續　商，終於得到本國政府的核准，是在後任的愛而考克手裘。一八四八年，前英租界的而積從八百卅畝擴充至二千八百二十畝，也是愛而考克和當時上海道麟桂所辦交涉的結果。</p>
<p>愛而考克　辱打上海道</p>
<p>在擴充租界的一年，上海近郊靑浦地方，發生了英國敎士與糧船水手的衝突事件。受傷敎士返滬，向領署報吿，愛而考克即親訪上海道，片面袒護英敎士，要求懲兇賠償。這時上海道已非麟桂，並不懼「洋」媚「外」，正色相吿，謂，「鬥毆細故，不足深詰」。豈知愛而考古聽了，竟老　成怒，忘掉了堂堂外交官的身份，拿起手中的長柄　　，來打那上海道德頭　。如此野　舉動，在弱國無外交的上海道，祗能拂袖　人，　　　對上滬縣知縣金咸說：「上海轄境，華洋雜處，民間毆打，事極平常，要我壓一迫本國百姓而獻媚外人，情願丢官不爲」。可是終因上峯兩江總督李星沅怕事，竟接受了愛而考克的無理要求，拘捕浦筆事水手十人，送往英領署，在黄浦灘枷示，又賠償受傷敎士的醫　費紋銀二百兩了事。可憐理直氣壯的上海道，却白白地紛他打了一下。</p>
<p>升任公使　野心勃勃</p>
<p>太平天國崛起以後，前租界採取所謂武裝中立政策，擅自改訂地皮章程，組織工部局、這成上海市政的　　組織，推本求源，愛而考克又是個始作俑者。也許就是爲這些功績罷，後來便升任爲駐　公使。他做了公使以後，對於手創的前工部局，十分　祖，一反前英公使布魯斯及美國駐華公使磐林格的原意，把已經前租界納稅外人會通過的地皮章程修改，將條文中加入中國　詢委員一節删去。愛而考克的作風，不僅對於中國，懷有偏貝，即對於上海工部局亦有獨霸的心，不惜利用職權來推翻原案</p>
<p>任性妄爲　印象惡劣</p>
<p>愛而考克任性妄爲，中國人對他的印象是惡劣極了。上海父老稱他爲感情最惡劣的英領事。但他在中國的工作，英政府是很合意的，因此，英皇竟賜予爵士的封號。</p>
<h3 id="c114">條用中國人名的路 <a href="#c114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>前租界道路，用外僑名字的很多，但是用華人名字的却少得可憐。最爲大家所熟知的只有朱葆三路，一度改稱的處洽卿路，還有一條不很川名的　桂路。</p>
<p>靈桂路在蒲石路北，巨籍達路南，是一條短短的汚穢小路，這是租界上最早以中國人命名的路，以紀念上海道麟桂的，因誤「麟」爲「靈」，乃寫成靈桂路。麟桂是旗人。一八四九年時任上海道，他雖科甲出身，但不脫粗疏之習。止海之有法租界，是麟桂含糊答應下來的，所以在法國人方面看來，麟桂不無可感，因此把這條路，來緦念這位上海道、此乃當時租界上惟一用業人名字的道路。</p>
<p>以前美貨　販全盛之時，在朱葆三路上是熙熙　攘地擠滿了人。此乃紀念上海商人朱葆三的。朱葆三，定海人，在滬經營商業很久，一九一八年至一九二〇年間任上海總商會會長，在商界上很有地位，擁有地產不少，據說朱葆三路的地，也是朱家的。不道將他的名字寫在路名牌上，並不是因爲他的地產，實在是因爲當初法租界曾得到朱氏不少的助力。朱葆三路，現在已改名了，稱爲漢口路。</p>
<p>洽卿也是上海甬　鉅商，曾任上海總商會會長，前工部局華董。中外人士因他常爲社會服務，在租界上建立了不少的公共福利事業，所以在他七十歲的時候，將西藏路改爲虞治卿路，以作紀念。民國廿五年十月一日，處洽卿路命名典禮舉行時，頗有一番盛况，虞氏手創的萬國商團中華隊，在路上遊行，更見威武。但此路現已復名西藏路。</p>

<p>當上海租界開闢的初年，面積雖小，馬路又不多，但路名却十分混亂，毫無系統可言，同時又有許多類同或近似的路名，更使人混淆不淸。這計多路名大都是外國人題了爲他們百己用的，假使用中文譯出來，看了覺得很不順眼。現在把舊英租界的許多原始路名，列表於下：四川路、初名權街，旋改名爲江蘇路。</p>
<p>江西路　名敎堂街</p>
<p>河南路　界街</p>
<p>山東路　廟街</p>
<p>山西路　老閘路</p>
<p>天津路　球塲弄</p>
<p>北京路　領事館路</p>
<p>南京路　花園弄</p>
<p>九江路　縴道路</p>
<p>漢口路　海關路</p>
<p>福建路　敎會路</p>
<p>廣西路　印度路這許多都是租界最原始的路名，一直到一八六五年年底，通過了嚴格的議案，把界內從南到北的馬路都改用中國省名，由東而西的馬路，改爲中國重要城市之名，此即現在一般人口頭所叫喚的名字。</p>
<p>虹口一帶的馬路，都取印度地名。茲將這一類路名譯成中文（音譯）如下：</p>
<p>濟寗路　愛根路</p>
<p>河間路　孟買路</p>
<p>置州路　科隆布路</p>
<p>黑龍路　加爾各答路</p>
<p>凉州路　客勃爾路</p>
<p>臨靑路　剛達哈爾路</p>
<p>寗國路　賴霍爾路</p>
<p>寗武路　勒克諾路</p>
<p>眉州路　客拉契路</p>
<p>海州路　倍耐爾斯路</p>
<p>桂陽路　康樸爾路</p>
<p>平凉路　麥特拉司路</p>
<p>「印度文字本來是很難讀的，這許多路名，記起來實在太不容易。前工部局因怕中國人不易讀，這許多路名將永遠不會通行，所以在一九一五年，重定一批新路名，來代替這雞記的印度字，從此之後，沿用至今。</p>
<h3 id="c116">極司非爾路　一段戀愛故事 <a href="#c116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>這條從靜安寺愚園路以迄白利南路的極司非爾路，得名之初，是有一段很有趣味的浪漫史的。</p>
<p>「位住在極司非爾路的葡萄牙人，有一天在虹口，經過一家馬戲班的帳幕之旁，聽見有一女子，嚶嚶哭泣，十分悲慘。這引起了他的好奇心，入內探問。原來這可憐的女孩子，因受不了班主的虐待而悲傷。那葡萄牙人頓起惻隱之心，付去一筆代價，將那女子贖了出來。</p>
<p>那女子脫離了馬戲班之後，即由敎會收養葡，旋又送至美國求學。數年後，回到上海感激那葡萄牙人搭救之恩，便嫁給了他。</p>
<p>那女子名叫極司。所以那葡萄牙人便把所住的那條路稱爲極司非爾路。後來連曹家渡都稱爲極司非爾村，兆豐公園稱爲極司非爾公園，西站也稱爲極司非爾站了。極司非爾路今已改稱爲梵王渡路。</p>

<p>我國的毛紡織業僅有二十年的歷史，還沒有脫離幼稚工業的階段；在今日的處境下，技術水準上和原料供應上，都不能和先進國競爭。一位有地位的毛紡織商吿訴記者：他們的機器，經過九年的折舊，苦無補充的機會。在上海所能購買的，都是二等貨色，效率不能和最新設備比擬。但是如向外國定貨，因爲人家本身的需要，要三年後才能交貨。在這種不相等的技術之下，再加上中國特有的高工資，我們能和外貨競爭嗎？</p>
<p>西北所產羊毛　不能職高等貨</p>
<p>原料供應的展望，同樣的不能使人樂觀。西北的羊毛，因爲過　忽略了選種，出品是不能用來織高等呢絨的。記者親自把西北羊毛和澳洲舶來品比較過，也無法　國貨吹噓。據說十天以前，有一位靑海省政府的要員，奉命來滬採辦毛紡織機器，因爲青海省當局預備以巨大資本，建立一　現代毛紡織。這種建設的精神是値得欽仰的，將來這個廠的出　可能在西北市塲立得住脚；但　由於人類的習慣和愛美的天性，和外貨競爭尙嫌不足。可是，反過來說，如果以外國羊毛作原料，就困難萬分，這是今日我國毛紡織界的主要痛苦。何以世界羊毛的取得如此之困難？第一是戰爭以後的必然現象，大家都在大戰中節衣縮食，把「提高生活水準」的打算寄托在戰後，現在，大戰像惡夢似的過去了，提高生活程度的計劃自需積極執行」</p>
<p>英國早已壟斷　國際羊毛市場</p>
<p>第二、全世界應該感謝」英倫的政治家和理財家，這班人在倫敦大霧之中，鍊出了驚人的商業眼光。遠在戰爭沒有結束的時候，他們已經看到戰後羊毛原料必感缺乏。於是去年在英國召開了一個羊毛會議，決定由聯合王國，澳洲，新西蘭，及南非聯邦諸國政府成立一個大公司，取名爲「聯合王國及自治領羊毛經銷公司」，經銷世界過剩之羊毛。現在這個公司已經正式組織，主持者是一位英國人。這個機構成立之後，羊毛在國際市塲上再不能自由流通。因此我國的毛織工業，是在一種仰人鼻息的處境中，勉强的存在着。</p>
<p>麥帥總部支持　日本毛織工業</p>
<p>最可痛心的事實：是羊毛原料的供給情况，五强之一的中國，尙比不上被人佔領的日本！日本被佔領以後，她的毛織工業因美軍以軍用物品接濟，竟能維持生產。同時日商已經呈請麥帥總部核准輸入羊毛三十五萬包，內中的三分之一，將於製成呢絨以後輸出國外；其餘的羊毛，留作自用。反觀我國，英國商業訪華團抵京之日，我們的專家曾和他們的紡縱代表懇商這個問題，但是沒有什麽　體的結果。可是將來日本毛織業之取得澳洲羊毛，似乎已經是定局的了。</p>
<p>中國毛紡織業　基礎薄弱可</p>
<p>生產的展望也不能使我們更有信心。現在一般的工廠，因爲工作紀律的關係，效率遠不如戰前。而我國現有毛紡織的錠子，爲數不多。以台柱的中紡而論，亦只有五萬錠，且因損壞甚多，尙在修理階段，開工有待。可是以日本而言，眞値得我們警惕。在戰前共有一百三十八萬錠子，戰後剩下了殘破的四十八萬錠，記者自權威方面得悉，她立刻就有三十二萬錠子可以總動。不特此也，日本還刊備恢復戰前的規模。至於日本人的工作精神呢？一週以前，有）位英國工黨議員應　帥之請，赴日參觀。回到英國以後公開的說。日本人是神奇的工作者，他們的活力和勤勞沒有被戰爭所損害；如果純從物質的觀點上看，他們的復興是必然的</p>
<p>欲求突破環境　只有澈底改造</p>
<p>在這種黯淡局勢之下，我們應尋求自處之道。記者感到唯一可走之路，是我國需有一長期的整個計劃，從羊種的改良起，到呢絨的推銷爲止。一位有經騐的廠主吿訴我：中國羊種的改良，起碼要三代（五年）；要有大的成效，需要二十年。經費常然很大。這種長期的大規模的事業，只有國家能够做，願意做。新機器的取得，亦　　家設法，我們不能白等三年，　人家在壓倒的優勢下，摧毁我們的薄弱基礎。在戰爭結束的前一年，美國有兩位紡議專家，奉派至重慶和戰時生　局接洽，想以美國的機械技術，改造我國的整個紡織業，來應付一個可能的長期戰爭。這是我園的黃金機會，可惜局勢的演變把它打消了。戰後再和美國談供給紡織機器的事，或是中美在我國合辦紡織機器廠的事，都是唯唯否否，得不到要領。事勢使然，不足爲怪。在日本工業力量重新威脅我們的今日，只盼盟國壓制日本，旣不是根本辦法，而且不會有效。唯一自衛之道，是自强和競爭；特別是中國工業界，必需有此抱負和志氣。</p>

<p>紡建公司鑒於本市電力供應不足，致影響所屬各廠生產量，爲補救起見，特向行政院物資供應局申請配售最新式小型透平發電機四架，裝置於該公司第十九廠內，現已開始裝配機件，該項發電機每架每日可發電一千瓩，係由美國運滬，並由宋院長批准配予紡建者，按該公司最近開工紗錠總數日夜各爲六十餘萬錠左右，所需電量一整日的爲八千餘瓩，故該項發電機裝竣後，可解決需電量二分之一强。</p>
<p>又據該公司負責人談，該公司增加產量計劃，可分三項，（一）自行設法供應電量，（二）多收棉花，分派人員至各地收購，本年度爲八十萬担，已於漢口，鄭州，沙市，南通等處收得五萬餘担，其他如天津，瀋陽東　鹽墾區等地，亦可收得大批棉花，（三）增加技術人員，俾加强技術能力及改善技術上之缺點，又該公司業於東北瀋陽設立分公司，生產力頗爲强大云。</p>
<h3 id="c120">高利貸問題　發生原因有三　平之方法亦有三端 <a href="#c120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕高利貸爲今日工商業發展之最大障礙；記者今日特走訪某銀行家，詢問其起因及消滅辦法。承答：今日商業銀行一般之放款利率爲一角二三分，在銀行方面言，不能謂過高。蓋銀行收到外界存款之後，須提出百分之二十存人中央銀行，再留出相當數目作爲準備，再需付出存款之利息；一併計算，收入固大，而開支亦殊可觀。追源今日高利貸之成因二第一爲幣値不穩定，法幣之購買力續有跌落，相對的即爲物價之不斷上漲，高利貸自然產生。同時民間富有者，將大量資金購買黃金美鈔，以保存幣値，致市面頭寸奇缺，利率爲之增高。其次爲今日銀行之營業範圍，較之戰前縮小甚多。例如外匯賣買本爲業務之一種，今日已被統制，國內匯款固尙許經營，但國家銀行匯水之低，使商業銀行根本無法競爭。不得已只有集中全力經營貸款，恃爲收益之主要來源。再其次，過去有一時期，物價不斷上漲，毫無波折，因之商人借錢囤貨者甚多，因供需關係，提高利率。目前銀行之利率，除特殊景氣之工商業外，普通均不堪長期負擔，在手續上爲謹愼起見，信用放款已成過去，平常均採用抵押放款。至於消滅高利貸，須從根本着手，大體言之，方法有三：（一）重建幣制，使其價値穩定，恢復人民之信心；如此美鈔黃金將有大量拋出，市面頭寸一多，市塲利率自然跌落！（二）國家銀行放棄緊縮信用政策，蓋工商業如不能於正當金融機關取得低利借款，只能出高利求之於黑市，如此黑市利率愈拉愈高；（三）官僚資本應加以取締，因此類有背景之事業，佔有特殊之優越地位，壓迫無背景之工商事業，使其舉債維持，無暇顧及利息之高低，亦間接促成高利貸之一因也。</p>
<h3 id="c121">工商業面危機　銀行亦不能例外 <a href="#c121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>昨據本市金融界某權威人士語稱，社會上若干人士以爲工商業已而臨危機，其主要之緊急解救辦法爲向銀行界舉行緊急貸款，低利貸款，殊不知目前金融界亦正遭遇難關，以目前各銀行存款總額與戰前相較，約爲戰前之二百倍。戰前各銀行的爲三十億，現則約爲六千億，而各銀行之　支則較　前增加五六千倍，以少數存款維持開支，自屬不可能，以故乃有高利放款等不正常之現象出現，又因各銀行存款數額旣少，則頭寸必緊，成求過於供之現象，亦爲造成高利原因之一，是故工商界欲向金融界要緊急貸款或低利貸款，其實各銀行自身頭寸不足，亦正遭遇困難，若干銀行現正以召開股東會，增加資金等辦法，挽救自身之生存云。</p>
<p>文化事業</p>
<p>大同文化事業股份有限公司，爲規模最鉅之新興文化生產機構，該公司經營造紙出版，文具之製造生產，並於蘇州虎邱山置造紙工廠，出品報紙書面紙等，該公司原計劃自印自編，澈底爲文化事業奮鬥，唯以資金不　，雖將造紙工廠籌備就緒，但所負高利貸達六億餘元，復以外貨湧到，國產紙張蒙受影響，雖力圖掙扎，截至目前則受高利貸之壓迫，日益嚴重，以致週轉不靈，遂已宣吿淸理，至該公司資產聞尙可抵償所負債務。</p>
<p>典當業</p>
<p>本市典業，分典押質等多種，以會員典取息比較稍低，其他押當一月利息，再加存箱，所有利息在三角五分，尙有押店（即質店）利息，每月取息按十天一期、有取至五分渚，故目前一般貧民，幾視典常爲畏途，即需上當，寗將衣物變賣，一勞永逸，致一般典常營業，一落千丈，記者昨　常業人員談，大都當業資金，均乘機經營地　錢莊，利息雖低收，約在二角半左右，但無消耗，且屬整筆，非典業手續之零碎，更有一般當主，視質當已成副業，雖則門市照　營業，實際派　奔波南北，大做其單帮生涯，因當業之沒落關係，一般估衣業亦受影響，舊式衣服難銷，新式衣服來源斷絕，因之最近估衣業，亦改變作風，取其工價低廉，咸製新衣出售，更有改弦易轍，門市零售棉布呢羢，以維營業云。</p>

<p>〔路透社舊金山二日電〕舊金山聯邦準備銀行預料在未來相當長之時期中，仍將感受白銀缺乏，據稱：自戰爭結束以來，白銀求過於供，其間之距離頗大。財政部中可以流動之存銀，自一九四二年五月十四萬萬盎司之高峯至一九四五年底已减少至四萬萬〇三百萬盎司。世界戰時白跟之產量在不斷减少中。一九四六年上半年，美國白銀產量僅九百萬盎司，而一九四一年之產量爲七千一百萬盎司，一九四五年之產量爲二千九百萬盎司。一九四六年中、美國白眼之一般需要，估計爲一萬萬二千萬盎司，而去年全世界之產量僅的一萬萬六千萬盎司。是故，美國一國幾可消耗目下全世界所生產之白銀矣。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓二日電〕美國今夏將白銀買價提高至每盎斯美元九角一厘二五後，十六個產銀國家紛向美國市塲輸出，八月份美國進口白銀達九百三十萬盎斯，七月份爲八百九十萬　斯，此在五月份每盎斯七角一分一厘時，僅進口一百二十萬盎斯。六月份爲一百五十萬盎斯。</p>

<p>上半時　昨日下午三時，東華與合羣在逸園交鋒，球迷三千人，頗不寂寞。法官鄧效良，鳴笛開　，東華阿戴不出塲，黃克厚任中鋒，東華攻勢猛烈，但以合羣球運亨通，東華騰攻未入，合羣偶亦有侵入東華禁區機會，惟更難得逞，半小時內，未開紀錄。直到卅四分鐘，幼良邊陲得球，疾趨而前，深入腹地，即行勾中，李垚候個正着，左足起處，應聲入網。二分鐘後，韓龍海帶球進攻，姚崇棄關出救，但龍海已兵臨城下，舉足斜射，送入空門，但同時與姚崇互撞，二人均昏厥倒地，龍海未幾即甦醒，姚崇則受傷較重，不得已離塲，由閔約翰庖代，上半時完了，東華二比〇前導。</p>
<p>下半時　易門再鬥，東華以陳明哲替出黃克厚，龍海改掛中鋒，合羣唐根福暫休，方明康上場東羣攻勢仍盛，惜陳明哲屢失良機，未有所獲，二十分鐘時，明哲妙傳，龍海橫掃，東華遂三破合羣之門。二分鐘後，韓龍彼犯規，張挺主罰任意球，遠射而入，合羣扳回一球。不久劉隆興頭頂，適逢陳明哲舉足，致鼻部流血，受傷離塲，卅七分鐘，孫老錦射門，閔約翰拍成角球，幼良開來，恰到好處，「外甥」頭頂命中。此後戰局益見鬆懈，終塲時　華以四對一克服弟子兵。</p>

<h3 id="c142">談談社會教育問題 <a href="#c142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>— 楊汝熊</p>
<p>社會敎育漸漸被大家遺忘了！今天不提起他來，不但一般社會人土，就是敎育界中人，也許已經記不起他。我在想：是不是有一天社會敎育會被擯棄到敎育的領域以外？</p>
<p>這是社會敎育當前的一大危機，它必然的會阻滯了社會敎育前途的發展！站在國家民族的立塲上，站在前進的整個敎育的觀點上，站在提高民智促進民主實現憲政的立塲上，難道還不應該提出這個問題來檢討檢討嗎？</p>
<p>社會敎育是敎育事業的一種，它的歷史和社會同樣久長，有了社會，就有了社會敎育，比學校制度的產生還來得早。受學校敎。育的，只限於兒童和靑年；而社會敎育的對象，却包括了全體的人民，無論男女老幼，都是施敎對象。可是社敎事業太少了，太不受人重視了，現在誰還知道社會敎育是重要的？誰還認識社會敎育事業的重要性而願提倡它的？我曾聽說有一位負着高級敎育行政責任的人，公然的說：全國的民衆敎育館都應該關門！我不知道這是一種怎樣看法？不過，由此也可以證明：現在不但社會人士不認識社會敎育，就是敎育界裏的人們，也把社會敎育視作可有可無的東西！我們聽了這種話，實在令人嘔氣，今後要發展社會敎育，我覺得先決的條件，必須使大家對社會敎育有更淸楚的認識，換句話說：要發展社會敎育，必須從心理建設做起！</p>
<p>小學，中學，大學，這有一貫的制度，定型的做法，敎育界人士對於它們認爲是理所當然，而社會一般人士也很容易有淸晰的瞭解。可是，社會敎育怎探呢？主持敎育行政的人，似乎總覺得它不配成立一套制度，也就有意無意的不使它制度化，而形成一種龐雜紛亂的局面，可有可無的結果。我覺得：要使社會敎育在人們眼光中，換換它的印象，頂要緊的便是使它制度化，體系化；什麽地方應該設置什麼社教關，什麽社敎機關應該做什麽工作，都必須有明確的規定才行。</p>
<p>社會敎育的對象那麽衆多，社會敎育的事業那　麽複雜，而社會敎育的經費却少得可憐，大家覺得社會敎育既可辦可不辦，那麽社敎經費當然也可多可少，能多固然很好，少了又有什麽大關係？其實，早在民國十八年，中央便已經規定過：「各省市社敎經費應佔敎育經費總數百分之十至二十」；可是現在有幾個省市社敎經費達到這個標準？</p>
<p>敎育是人與人之間的一種關係，必須受敎者願意學習，必須敎者善於施敎，然後這一種教育關係才會獲得預期的良好的效果。我們根據這一個根本的認識，我們才知道師資的合格與否，是對於敎育效果的好壞具有決定性的。小學，中學，和大學都需要良好的合格師資，道是大家所公認的；爲什麽辦社曾敎育却可以隨隨便便找個人去辦？可是，許多人的觀念確是如此，的確認爲社會敎育是人人能辦的。看看現在國內專門訓練社敎人才的學校太少了；除了國立社敎學院和江蘇省立敎育學院以外，訓練高級社會教育人才的學校就找不到了。至於訓練中級社敎人才的學校，本來敎育部規定各省市應該辦社敎師範學校，可是已經成立的太少了。大家責難各地民敎館圖書館辦不好，辦理的人不能稱職，這能怪誰？</p>
<p>五　社會教育教材教具問題</p>
<p>「空口說白話」的教學法早經落伍了，要加強教學的效率，必許盡量利用圖書儀器，標本模型，甚至最新的電影和廣播。各　學校應該編敎科書，這是大家所公認的天經地義的事實，可是，社敎機關就不應該對準民衆生活上各方面的需要，來編印各種適當的敎材嗎？敎育行政當局對於編輯及審定各級學校各科敎科　，十分認眞，絲毫不苟，這是我們贊成的；可是，我們對於敎育行政當局不爲社敎機關編輯及審定各種民衆需要的敎材，却不能讚美。有了機構，有了人才，如果沒有施敎的材料，或者僅黨　時的隨便的亂找些材料，是不會收獲良好的效果，甚至還有錯誤的危險的！</p>
<p>六社會教育成績攷核問題</p>
<p>辦小學辦得好不好，可以他的學生成績來答覆；辦中學，辦大學，辦得好不好，同樣的也可以它們的學生成績來答覆。學生成續好，社會一般人便會說這學校辦得好，便會從種種方面贊助它。社敎　　的好壞，拿什麼表明呢！大家都說某一社敎機關辦得沒有成績，因爲他們看不到它的學生成績的表現。學校的學生是固定的，是專心受敎的，自然容易攷査到它的好壞；社敎對象　麽複雜，那麼不固定，而且還只能分出他們一小部份時間受敎，成績當然難以表現，所以今後的問題，要把社敎機關成績考査　準先行確定，並公開於社曾一般人士，使大家心目中都知道各　社敎機關辦得好壞的標準，這麽一來，辦的人知道努力的目標，社會人士也才會有公正的評判。以上六點：我個人對於肚會敎育的「罪言」，也是對於社會敎育的「危言」，讀者或不致以爲是「危言聳聽」吧？（三十五年十月卅一日於敎育部）</p>

<p>蔣主席在無錫　卅一日無錫訊　高武弘</p>
<p>這消息在三十一日早晨，從湯恩伯將軍的口中證實了，頓時像飛馬一樣的傳播開去，果然，主席的專車，在萬衆鵠候恭迎下，於十二時二十分抵站，停靠後，主席衣莊嚴的藍袍黑掛大禮服，右手執銀灰色便帽足登黑紋皮鞋黑絲襪，首先下車，繼之者爲蔣夫人，御莊靑色西服，儀態萬方，雍容華貴。其次爲馬歇爾特使夫婦，美國「生活」雜誌發行人魯斯，及主席隨員曁侍從等五十餘人，依次魚貫下車，一行緩步出車站後，主席於民衆夾道歡呼聲中，首先與馬歇爾夫人登「〇〇七一四」專用汽車，蔣夫人與馬特使，登另一輛藍色轎車，各隨員亦相繼登車，由陳大慶乘吉普卡前導，經吳橋，惠山，循錫宜路，直達小箕山，沿途受民衆熟烈歡呼，主席在車中而露笑容，揮帽示意，頻呼：「謝謝你們！」</p>
<p>駐節五小時轟動全城　太湖風色添無限光彩</p>
<p>主席六秩華誕，簿海同慶，全國各地都展開了偉大的祝典，以酬答主席的豐功偉績。主席在這一夭，却避壽到無錫來，藉以得到半日休息，並飽覽闊別十載的湖山勝景，以使他的華誕過得更靜穆”更有意義，在他輝煌的生命史上，佔去了美麗明快的一頁。</p>
<p>京滬衛戍司令部無錫指揮所，於十月三十日令無錫縣府，飭屬淸潔街道，修理路政，整頓市容，縣府奉令後，立即手諭城區區長，會同憲兵隊警察局負責澈底淸掃城內外各街道及火車站等地段，限當日黃昏前畢事。同時徵集民伕六百名，於早晨起修築損壞不堪的湖濱大道，駐錫傘兵部隊，也出動協助，限於當晚究成。並由憲警負責取締街頭攤販工作，十分緊張嚴厲。同日上午，在　築成的無錫機塲上，先後有二架飛機降落，第一架不知是誰，第二架則是湯恩伯將軍。從這些上面看來，大家使紛紛懸測，也許主席要到無錫來皮他的花甲壽誕，記者們也無心坐在編輯室裏寫稿，連夜出去採訪，但各方面都守口如瓶，不肯透露半點消息。</p>
<p>「蘋香號」畫舫向黿頭渚行進</p>
<p>十二時五十分抵小箕山，主席挽馬夫人，馬特使挽蔣夫人，下車後相偕登預泊於湖邊的「蘋香」號畫舫，主席在艇首小坐，又單獨上岸駐足岸際，眺望遠處風景片刻，一暢胸襟，始緩步上船，由舟子解纜直放太湖。當</p>
<p>主席座船向黿頭渚進行時，左右後面，有隨員所乘之艇船簇擁，沿途戒備森嚴，禁止船隻通行，「明湖」號小砲艇，以半圓形在湖面上往來巡邏。全體執役車夫，每人於胸前佩有紅布條，以資辨識，設想可謂週到。</p>
<p>「蘋香」號畫舫前艙置長餐桌，桌中白色花瓶內，插着一束紅菊花，四窗綴以藍綢窗帘，與白色檯布相映成趣。開船後十分鐘，即在艙中設席進午膳；全部菜餚，爲迎賓樓所辦其菜單爲：什景大拚盆，炒大肉，紅烤冬筍，冬菰冬笋豆腐，松鼠桂魚，醬包鷄丁，鷄油菜心，蟹粉魚翅，香酥全鴨，玫瑰壽桃，伊府壽麵，火鍋，（包括四暈四素，鷄，生蛋，生腰片，士件；老豆腐，白菜，綫粉菠菜）主席甚表贊許，餐畢，面露笑容，悠然自得地遠眺着碧波遠山，對夫人和馬歇爾夫婦笑謂：「吃魚蟹，要到無錫來。」</p>
<p>七十二峯山館小坐府瞰太湖</p>
<p>主席於餐時頻頻與各貴賓乾杯，馬帥夫婦，也一再起立，向主席夫婦祝賀，據接近主席者談，主席己數年未曾如此開懷豪飲。二時許賓主皆微醺，乃進台灣西瓜。主席對湯恩伯進獻的壽字蛋糕，甚表滿意，即在艙內將蛋糕置於餐桌上，上插壽燭十六支，經夫人燃點後，由主席親自一氣吹熄，預祝福壽無疆。</p>
<p>二時三十分，船抵　頭渚，主席與馬夫人爲首，全體捨舟登岸，遊客肅立道旁恭迎，主席溫容頷首答禮，與各貴賓拾級登山，至七十二峯山館，面對湖山，小坐品茗，俯視太湖，全景盡收眼底，主席笑問馬特使：「此間風景如何」？「余隨主府所到各地，風景無有不美者」。這是馬歇爾的回答。</p>
<p>在山上盤　約歷三十餘分鐘，即相率下山，主席十分高典，對湯恩伯將軍說：「黿頭渚的風景比四湖好」！是的，本報通訊中，也曾把西湖和太湖作過一個簡明的比較：「一個是婉變的少女，一個就是俊拔的英雄」。（參閱六月二日本報第七版）一經主席品評，更是身價十倍了。至黿頭渚邊，席地而坐，耳聽湖水激石，塵意盡滌，主席復股股以太湖的民生，水產，運輸諸問題垂詢，馬歇爾夫人喜歡山間的楓葉，囑侍從大量擷取後帶回，以作紀念。</p>
<p>主席一行，於四時一刻與黿頭渚吿別，時無錫小敎聯誼會同人適在黿頭渚聚餐，聞訊後率領小學生列隊恭送，高呼：「蔣主席萬歲」，主席頻頻頷首，揮左手示意。登汽車後出橫雲公園，沿環湖大道進西門，經復興路，公園路，圓通路，出光復門巡視無錫全城一週，沿途民衆夾道相迎，爆竹聲與歡呼聲，響徹雲霄，情緒熱烈，盛况空前，具見主席受民衆敬仰愛戴之深。抵車站時，有銀色單冀機一架，盤旋上空，散發恭祝主席壽誕的傳單，民衆爭於攫取傳誦。</p>
<p>主席專車，於五時三十分在萬民歡送聲中啓動，一時歡呼之聲雷動，主席自車中起立，至車門口揮手示意，含笑連聲說：「好，好，好！謝謝你們」。羣衆再度高呼：「主席萬歲」！目送專車於暮靄中漸漸隱去。</p>
<p>按：主席之駕臨無錫，此爲第三次，第一次爲民國十八年北伐完成後，第二次爲民國二十五年；三次俱偕夫人共來。主席每次到無錫來，時代環境都有極大的轉變，這三次遊錫，在中國歷史上剷分了三個不同的時期，也正代表了主席三個奮鬥的階段。</p>
<p>最近正式收回的租界　廣州沙面輸廓畫</p>
<p>十月廿九日廣州航訊　本報特派員梁風</p>
<p>就在這個十月杪，廣州市當局發出公吿，將廣州僅有的租界——沙面，正式收回管轄。這消息使廣州人士無限興奮；因爲沙面這地方雖然不大，但它是過去在滿淸季年（西歷一八五九年），以不平等條約關係，而劃爲英法租界的，後來經過我們政府歷二十餘年，爲廢除不平等條約而努力；到今天才得友邦的同意，在他們取消在華治外法權及其他特權的條約之下，才使這地方的管轄權歸還我們手裏，這怎能使我們不興奮呢？而這塊雖屬小小的地方，也自然有它在歷史上的價値了。</p>
<p>最美麗的一角</p>
<p>如果我們是從河道到廣州來的話，當抵達廣州市區的邊緣時，便先會在西南角落發現一個樹蔭濃蔽，景色雅緻的小島，這便是廣州最美麗的一角——沙面。這地方全面積有五十五英畝有四平方里，浮在珠江河面，由珠江一條小小支流把它和市區隔離，它便靠東西兩橋來和市區連接。自從在八十年前道地方劃爲英法租界之後（其中英佔四十六英畝法佔九英畝），英法人士利用道個四面環水的天然環境，加上人工的鳩築，使它成爲一個優美的所在。在這區內，全是宏偉而精緻的洋房；環島堤邊滿植了參天的古樹，和一幅幅碧靑靑的草坪相映，倍襯出這區域一張幽雅的氣氛；每當淸晨或者黃昏，緩步堤邊，遙望珠江帆影上下，更有無限佳趣；所以沙面這地方，實在是一個最理想的公園。</p>
<p>那裏旣然環境優美，而且又是租界，因此一向都是外僑聚居之地；各國駐粤的領事陀都設在那裏，其餘便是外商洋行和商店。那裘雖然是中國的地方，但裏面不但沒有中國人的住宅，就中國人要進去，非經過把守住橋頭的紅頭阿三幾番的盤問，也不能通過的。道一條不滿四丈寬的小小河流相隔，使廣州和沙面變爲兩個世界，廣州市民祇可隔河相望，來幻想沙面裏面隱藏的神秘；恐怕在廣州住了一輩子，而從未到過沙面的人，正多着哩！所以數十年來的沙面，實是稱爲「特區」，或者「禁區」地帶，一點也不過份。</p>
<p>不再是特區了</p>
<p>正因爲有了這個「特區」，廣州才有了民國十四年的「六二三」慘案。因爲是年五月，上海市民爲反抗日紗廠槍殺顧正紅，遊行示威，竟遭租界巡捕槍擊死傷載道，演成「五卅」慘案。消息傳至廣州，市民極表憤慨，遂亦於同年六月二十三日，全市大中小學生及社團民衆示威巡行，路經沙而對岸的沙基，竟就同樣的被在沙面駐紥的英法守備隊用機槍掃射，一時血肉橫飛，屍骸枕藉，使一條遙長的沙基，染滿鮮血，其慘狀實目不忍覩，當時因記者亦曾參與行列，故印像特別深刻。後來，市政府爲紀念這次殉難的市民，便將沙基改爲「六二三」路，並在沙面通沙基的西橋北端，立了一個石碑，上面題着「毋忘此日」四個大字，現在這石碑依然屹立，供人憑弔。道事件現在說來，祇是一種歷史上的陳跡吧了！</p>
<p>現在的沙面，當然不再是一個「特區」或者「禁區」了！自從日軍投降後，沙面便由我政府隨同其他收復地區，逕從敵僞手中收回。記者在光復後回到廣州，苜先感到與前不同的，就是沙面有了廣州市警察局沙面分局的設置，同時東西橋站着的已不是佩着「皇冠」的紅頭阿三，而是我們戴上靑天白日帽徽的警察了。而沙面區內，自然减少了若干「洋味」，但它的風光如舊，一切景物依然；那裏有輝煌壯麗的勝利大厦，裏面設有酒樓，旅館，和跳舞廳，這是達官貴人招待貴賓最理想的塲所；還有省府辦的康樂會，裏面也有餐間，球塲和泳塲等設備；市府的網球塲和靑年團辦的靑年游泳塲也在那裏。去年新一軍駐粤時，孫立人的總部也是設在沙面的。現在那裏重要的機關有：華南區的海軍總司令部，敵僞產業處理局，「聯總」辦事處，「行總」廣東分署，「中電」和「中製」辦事處等；以外便是美，英，法，葡，丹麥，瑞士，挪威等國的駐粤領事館，和一些回來復員的外商洋行；其餘大部份的華麗洋房，都變了我們達官貴人的公館所佔有。據沙面警察分局的統計；沙面全區有二百餘戶籍，人口共在三千以上，其中外僑僅四五百人而已。</p>
<p>誠然，沙面的收回，是足以使我們興奮的；現在全國已經沒有租界了！有的恐怕祇是香港九龍和澳門吧！我們更希望不久的將來，我們能够得到一個更興奮的消息，這便是我們的友邦能够尊重彼此間的友誼，將這些僅有的地方主權歸還給我們，這大槪不是一種奢望吧！</p>
<p>星期論壇　發揚我國的和平教育！　周尙</p>
<p>巴黎和會閉幕之後，接下來又舉行聯合國大會，同時第二届聯合國敎育科學文化會議，亦將於巴黎開幕。報載吾國代表決定本月初啓程。我們希望這個國際性的文敎會議，眞能奠定世界和平的基礎。誠如組織的章宣言所說，「僅以政府間政治與經濟之協商爲基礎之和平，不能取得全世界人民一致永久眞誠之維護。」他們已覺悟到非用敎育文化的力量，不足以奠定世界眞正和平。吾國有法寳可致世界永久和平，只要這法寳使全人類澈底明暸，世界便不難大同，更不難和平。深盼此次吾國代表能實現這個初步的使命。</p>
<p>人類的戰爭，起源於思想的衝突。這次戰爭是民主主義思想與法西斯主義思想的衝突。民主主義的聯合國家已經贏得勝利，而理想的世界和平，剛剛翻開第一頁。縱然我們有憲章宣言等等的和平保障，但作戰時所揭的理想戰後能否實行，我們要看各種國際會議能否成功。</p>
<p>法西斯主義者的侵略，固已成水小撈月，但建設美麗的愉快的和平世界，應將與企求戰爭勝利同樣努力。這次的血流够了，就不該讓下一代流第二回。讓這次戰爭成爲人類最後一次的戰爭吧！凡爾賽條約是前車之鑑。當時戰敗後的德國，像切去四肢的可憐蟲，可是國民敎育完全自由。國力空虛的德國，大量投資於國民敎育。可惜他們投資的敎育是施行尼采超人暴力思想的教育，卒造成人煩再來一向自相殘殺，把人類努力的文明結品化爲砲灰。</p>
<p>敎育的力量爲什麼會這樣大？因爲敎育是培養思想，而思想是行爲的前驅，也可說思想就是行爲。我們祈求和平世界，先該用敎育培養人類的和平思想。「牛飲水成乳，蛇飲水成毒。」敎育好比水，運用得法，就成補品，不得法，便成毒素。覇道的國家川教育作侵略工具，王道的國家則用敎育作播種和平種子的利器。爲了實現世界永久的和平，我們該以和平教育，促進世界和平。德日已在進行着再敎育，應該使其精神上能解除武裝。而聯合國自己的作風之無懈可擊，尤爲再敎育的最高而最有效的精神之所存。</p>
<p>戰爭是一根新陳代謝的鞭子，要鞭策政治家變新，教育家變新，敎育變新，世界變新。杜魯門總統於九月廿五日在白宮暢談國際文敎組織的重要性，並謂，「吾國如無諒解，吾人即無和平可言；吾人如無敎育，吾人亦無和平可言。」美國伊利諾州工業學校敎授戴勞建議將國聯舊址改設世界大學作改造心理維持和平的基礎。九月中紐約安狄柯城成立了一個世界敎育組織，計二十五國代表，代表百萬敎師，兩屋期會議中大部份時間化在討論如何以敎育來促進國際和平。澳洲所舉行的「新敎育研究會國際會議，」亦集中注意於未來的世界和平。</p>
<p>過去世界敎育，除中國而外，不脫三派：（一）民主主義教育，（二）法西主義敎育，（三）社會主義敎育。第一種陷於個人的實用主義，第二種爲辯證唯心論，第三種爲辯證唯物論，各有其幣，以此造成功利侵略鬥爭的世界，唯有三民主義敎育才是眞正民主主義敎育，才能造成眞正世界和平。它含有民主·法西·社會主義三派的敎育哲學之綜合性。具有揚棄作用，揚其長而棄其短，民生主義即社會主義，即大同主義，民族主義是國族主義，非國家主義。民權主義反對洛克盧梭的「天賦權利，」要求得眞平等。</p>
<p>三民主義敎育是中國傳統敎育的一脈相承，可是王道敎育，是和平敎育，是至善敎有。全世界該採用中國敎育的精神，世界才能永久和平。中國傳統敎育的精神是「重德主義」。漢興，重德主義成了確定的敎育政策。孔子的修身齊家治國平天下，一以貫之。老子也說，「修之於身，其德乃眞，修之於家，其德乃餘，修之於鄕，其德乃長，修之於邦，其德乃豐，修之於天下，其德乃善。」他們都提出「以天下爲一家，以中國爲一人」。</p>
<p>孔子講仁，老子講慈，而中國的家庭可謂「仁慈培養塲」，爲西洋人所缺乏·西洋人由自然到人，中國人由人到自然。西洋以征服自然着眼，對象是力，社會生活爲鬥爭，中國以調節人生爲着眼，對象爲生機，社會生活是萬物並育。在西洋物質開發已經發達，而人類關係猶欠完美。在中國物質生活雖露貧乏，而人生關係猶感和樂。這都是傳統的敎育結果，這種敎育就是我們的法寳。</p>
<p>三民主義敎育宗旨，實則就等於大學上舉出的「大學之道……在止於至善」的一段綱領。精神物質，雙方兼顧，物吾並重，不但爲現在，且爲將來，個人有自由，團體有自由，爲人亦爲己，不抹殺民族國家，同時倡世界大同。把這種「放諸四海而皆準」的至善敎育，推行於世界，世界何患無永久的和平。</p>
<p>中國自昔稱爲禮義之邦，個人旣貴無爭，政治亦尙德化。禮樂之盛，揖讓之美，原屬內政，有讓德的政府，對外政策，一定反侵略，尙和平，尙書堯典則曰「協和萬邦」，顧命則曰「爕和天下」。古代的賓禮，充滿着一種穆穆的和平氣象。這便是否國敎育的表現。</p>
<p>兩月前紐約時報雜誌載有熟悉中國文敎的撥雷脫的「世界和平與中國哲學」一文，他以爲中國社會政治哲學，是以義務而不是以權利爲基礎。又謂獨立國家必須承認對於其他國家的義務，自認是整個家庭的一員，才能和好相處；保有强大力量的國家，必須瞭解他們有運用這種力量，增進人類福利的責任，才能防止侵略。他認識這種理想，在中國哲學中可以找到，因爲中國哲學都是研究人類和好相處的方式。又曰，孔子的理想世界是美麗的，唯有培養人類的責任感運用到國際方面去，才能實現眞正的國際社會。</p>
<p>人家已看出我們維持世界和平的法寳了，我們希望此次代表應帶一套中國的大道理去，翻成各國語言，普遍宣傳，尤其是三民主義敎育的理論體系，自己要好好用一番功夫報吿世界，使他們接受歡迎我們的文敎俾作和平的酵母。並須提議組織國際敎育機稱，作世界安全機構的中心，實施中國王道的和平的敎育，以謀世界的和平。</p>

<h3 id="c143">中國紡織工業之發展 <a href="#c143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>— 燈裘紹</p>
<p>紡織工業在中國的工業上佔着最重要的　　　　　着二十萬以上的工人，三百億以上的資金。在戰前，國家要靠他五千萬元以上的納稅，所以紡織工業有關於整個國民經濟的興替，也長中國工業現代化的前驅，對於這項重要的工業，我們希望從檢討過去的情形中，知道今後的中國紡織工業應當從那一條路上去努力。</p>
<p>中國自設紡織廠當以李鴻章氏首創上海洋布局爲開端，此後紡織工廠即續有設立，可是自鴉片及中日戰爭後，外商獲得在通商口岸設立工廠的權利，因之在中國之外商紗廠乃驟然增加。至光緒三十四年，全中國雖有紗廠五十二家，但其中日商却佔有八家，英商六家，德商二家，中外合辦的佔有二家，直至民國三年八月歐戰的爆發，才奠定了這項民族工業的基礎，因在戰爭期內，各國正竭力於自身生死的間題，無暇顧及工商業的發展，即執紡織業牛耳的英國，亦努力减少工人，以致無力生產，出貨驟减，因之紡織品的市價，乃逐日騰貴，所以當時中國紡織工廠，莫不一本萬利，盈餘積厚，而有資產的，亦見有利可圖，都投資於紡織工業上面，以致新設工廠，如雨後春筍，一時簇生，把中國的紡織工業造成一新局面，至民國十一年末，全國總綻數，由五十九萬枚，劇增至二百萬枚，紡織工廠增加十七家之多，此時爲中國工業最可稱述的一頁。</p>
<p>民國十二年以後，中國紡織事業無甚特殊發展，蓋其時政治未上正軌，軍閥割據，連年內戰，不事建設，交通不便，而許多組工廠，皆因營業不振，有的改，有的停閉，不過在此時期內添設的新廠亦不少，然咸因上述緣因，紡織工業未能得以充分發展。</p>
<p>以至民國廿年九一八事變，日以武力侵佔東三省，翌年又於中國的蘭開夏上海（註一）發生一二八戰爭，道二次戰爭，故予中國人民最悲痛的傷痕，同時也給了紡織工業最嚴酷的打擊，當時遭戰事炸燬，及被迫而停工的廠達於全國五分之一，而所受損失，更非短時期所能恢復者。且東三省被日武力侵佔後，使我國輸往東北之紡織物（佔全國百分之卅一强），由日益减而至完全斷絕銷路，而日本爲擴張其政治勢力起見，而增强對華北市塲的控制，日商又不顧成本，跌價競爭，更使華商束手無策，銷路短縮。</p>
<p>銷路减少和紗價跌落，乃使我們的紡織工業，幾於一敗塗地，各工廠雖一再掙扎，减工裁員，加重工作，但結果仍難維持，至廿三年六月全國紡織工業聯合會統計，全國紡織工廠完全停工者達十二廠之多，此外各工廠雖勉維現狀，但盡皆縮小營業範圍。</p>
<p>一國工商業的繁榮，是與政治有密切關係的，在民國廿五年內，中國國勢仍浸在熱度惡劣的狀態之下，國內的企業也同樣遭過到空前未有的危機，所以紡織工業還是跑不出不景氣的厄運，不過在中國紡織工業在這衰落時期還有着一種很特殊的現像，就長從民國廿二年起，國內紗綻數年之在增加着，但是再依工作狀况而言，停工减工的增加，也足以看出綻數增加是種不正常的現像。</p>
<p>直至民國廿五年下半年，法幣政策實行，國內交通亦較前發達，又因農村經濟復蘇，人民購買力增强，以致紡織工業驟形起色，紡織品銷路猛暢，各廠存貨銷售一空，雖各廠日夜開工，仍有供不應求之勢，且紗價飛漲，各廠均獲厚利。因此前停工歇業之各廠，皆乘機絡續復工，而計劃中添設之新廠及紗廠擴充紗綻，計該年六個月中，計新增紗綻達十五萬之多，此又爲紡織工業之黃金時代。</p>
<p>不過曾幾何時，中日戰爭爆發，紡織工業又陷於危急狀態，且於廿六年上半年之間，允値得一提者，即天津，靑島兩地之紡織業幾盡落於日人之手，錢綻數佔全地達百分之七十，因之華商乃汲汲可危，而日商却方興未艾。</p>
<p>戰時各紡織工廠損失甚重，後淪陷區又被敵僞强迫收買棉布後，各廠乃幾全部停工，歇業，而遷回內地之各廠，亦因交通隔絕，原料運輸不便，得能全部維持開工者，亦屬寥寥，然勝利以後，敵僞紡織廠統由我國接管，在華三十餘年來之日本經濟改爲國家經營，洵屬我國紡織工業史上空前盛事，更因戰後國內紡織品普遍缺乏，益以紗貴花賤，各紡織廠乃莫不積極活動，藉謀復興，故各地紡織工業進行復工情形甚較迅速，至本年六月底，平均復工者百分率已達百分之六〇—八〇，惟有上月外匯調整後，紡織原料市價驟漲，工人工資又增加不已，且利息負担日重，日本紡織業復興程度復凌駕我國之上，長此以往，紡織業是否久持不變，殊難預卜。</p>
<p>以上所述，爲我國三十五年來紡織業發展之概略，在這裘，我們也可以看到一點以往紡織工業發展的綫索，然作者學識淺陋，遺漏固多，而見解錯誤之處，亦在所難免，深望斯界名士，有以敎之爲幸。</p>
<h3 id="c144">改進中國蠶絲業 <a href="#c144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>— 蔡耀椿</p>
<p>蠶絲發源於我國，爲我國農業副產之大宗對外貿易之主要貨品，而產地遍全國，利潤澤萬民，其繁榮衰替，亦足以左右我國國民經濟之榮枯，惟我國人民，素重保守，以致數千年來，對於飼育繅製，毫無改進，固步自封，反被英意等國後來居上，爲欲挽回權利，復興絲業與歐美各國相競爭，則非從事改革不可，茲將管見所及，累述如下，尙祈諸專家有以賜敎焉：</p>
<p>甲·生產技術方面</p>
<p>A·灌漑農人育蠶，選種，裁桑等智識。</p>
<p>普及敎育之工作決非在短時期內可以辦理竣事，而改進蠶絲業乃急不容緩之事故在現階段欲達到上次目的不得不暫採用間接之方法，即由政府在產絲區設立蠶桑指導所，積極派員指導蠶戶育蠶等科學方法，並隨時加以化騐及統計，切實取締劣種。對於裁桑，應較其如何施肥，如何綸流剪代，與如何防止害虫，桑質乃得提高，絲質自亦隨之改進。</p>
<p>B·充實絲廠資本</p>
<p>此種含有國家性之事業最好國營，不然亦須使絲廠資本充足。蓋資本充實之絲廠始得注意於繅製，技術方面之改進。如雇用專門人材，添購新機器等。其辦法乃由政府舉辦登記，規定絲廠最低資本額，資本不足者不得開工，由政府以公允之價格收買其產業，加以改良後，由國家出資經營。如此則粗製濫造之弊乃可除去，蠶絲業之復興可期。</p>
<p>C·專門人材應大量培植</p>
<p>政府應於各地設立專門學校，聘請學識淵博經騐豐富之敎授，從事訓練專門人材，灌輸專門智識，多予實習機會。此後對於歷年中國蠶絲業失敗之原因，以及改進之方法，允應切實加以硏究，則學生畢畢業後始能有所貢獻於國家，否則徒成資本家剝削工人之工具耳。</p>
<p>乙·生產組織方面</p>
<p>A·政府應實施統制</p>
<p>晚近世界各國之工業，莫不由政府予以統制及資助，良以工業之繁榮與衰替，關係一國之國本，豈可一任其興衰哉？中國工業幼稚不堪。與歐美各國相競爭，是以允需政府以充分之保護與統制。前車之鑒，豈可忽視？故今後政府當於各產區設立機關統制蠶繭價格，以及收繭事宜，然後以公允之價格售與絲廠，絲廠內容亦由政府機關予以監督，及指導。出品須嚴厲檢騐，分成等級，各級之售價槪須一律，苟能如是，則國內各地生產情形漸趨規律化，當局自易察出各種缺點逐漸加以改進。</p>
<p>B·設立直接推銷機關</p>
<p>爲避免間接銷售商人從中剝削利潤起見，應在國內各大口岸設立總機關，辦理登記各廠之出品，種類，存貨數額。一面在各銷絲國家設立分機關，調査銷絲情形，且能熟悉各國蠶絲市塲之供給情形，收「知己知彼百戰百勝」之效。</p>
<p>C·金融機關應與農人及絲商切實合作</p>
<p>近年世界經濟極度空荒，歡美各國又乘機侵入中國，中國農村在雙重壓迫下瀕於破產，各地農民赤貧如洗，何來本錢大量育蠶？故近年中國蠶絲產量激增，而各絲廠亦因連年失敗，資本拮据，未能大量生產，此種困難，我國金融界實應切實予以援助。於春秋蠶汎，對農民實行低利借貨，以所產蠶　作爲抵押，爲時雖僅一月，而農民則受惠不淺矣。一方面在絲暢銷時，金融機關對絲廠大量放款。俾可積極生產，以免坐失時機。</p>
<p>上述數點，均爲急要之務。及時努力，按步改進，則夙執世界年耳之中國蠶絲業，不難再度稱雄於全球也。</p>
<h3 id="c145">等待 <a href="#c145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>— 鶯</p>
<p>在工業的經營方面，等待是一個很重要的成功的要素。這裏所說的等待，並不是萎縮不前，等待時日，而是在平日要努力，前進，等到機會來臨，就把握住那個機會，不要輕易放棄。</p>
<p>在環境不利的時候，應該等待，等待環境好轉。</p>
<p>但要能够等待，倒也並不容易，必需有一種維持的力量，這種維持的力量，果然經濟的支持等都是非常重要的，但可以由於不怕艱難的毅力而產生。</p>
<h3 id="c146">工商管理概論 <a href="#c146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>— 徐百益</p>
<p>雇員心理</p>
<p>前言</p>
<p>在企業的經營上，一般人都認爲最難於解決的是人事問題，有許多很好的事業，因爲人事上發生意見，弄得不得進行，甚至走上結束或解散的途徑。</p>
<p>這一種情形，往往是指上級人員之間的人事問題，在雇用勞工的地方，那末對於勞工的問題也是很難於解決的。</p>
<p>有許多人都不知道什麼叫做科學管現和科學管理與工商管理有什麽分別，這可以簡單地加以解釋。所謂科學管理是對於工商管理的實施，都要照着科學的方法做去，譬如說向來處理日常事務，是用口頭說話沒有記錄，這就是不科學，照着科學管理的原則，那末應該有記錄。</p>
<p>但這是狹義的科學管理，科學管理的大目標，是以最少限度費用和勞力，能够有最大限度的生產和最高的利潤，在一二八滬戰之後，商務印書館的印刷廠和編譯所都燬於砲火，那時候，正是一個極度困難的時期，但該館的總經理王雲五先生曾經每天自己以十二小時的工作盡力的規劃各種事務的進行，因此不到一年，生產力量反比一二八之前增加幾倍。這就是用了科學管理的方法所得到的結果，他對於時間是非常寳貴的。所以他說一個人吃飯祇要五分鐘就够了。有許多他的下屬都譏笑他這是不可能的，其實，這雖是一個極淺顯的例子，但可以用到事務的處理上。一個人能够把事務處理得十分完善，那是第一步。第二步就要减少所需要的時間，本來需要十分鐘的，如果能够在五分鐘之間做好，那末不是一天之中就可以多做許多事嗎？所以科學管理有一個極大的原則，那就是减少所有無謂的耗費。</p>
<p>科學管理還有一個先決的條件，那就是一方面要產生極豐富的利潤，一方面，還要促進工人的福利，因爲單從資方着想，一個事業尙不能持久地繁榮，一定要使工人的生活能够改善，使他們能够安定地工作，那末他們方能够有健全的身體，健全的思想，而產生優美的工作。</p>
<p>在國外有許多偉大的工廠裏，都建立起一個市鎭，工人們都住在裘面，他們的生活非常安定，更用了消費合作社等的辦法把他們日常所需的東西，因爲集團購買而享受較廉的代價，他們有公共食堂，甚至有運動塲，有電影院，有義務學校，圖書館，使所有的工人可以安居樂業，不願也不必再離開那可愛的市鎭到外面去求取娛樂，他們在這種環境之下生活着，自然能够造成一種善良的風氣，在這種情形之下，事業與家庭，眞可以說是打成一片了。</p>
<p>但在中國，因爲生產事業尙沒有發達到相當時候，所以尙不能辦到那種完善的程度，但是在人爲，祇要有工商管理的人才，硏究工商管理的方法，（我們暫時名之謂工商管理，不要把科學管理的大帽子帶起來，因爲我們還是注重實際）進步是不生問題的。</p>
<p>在以前經營一種企業，祇知道用最低的價目買進原料，從事生產，售相當價目而獲得相當的利潤，對於勞工的問題，不十分注意。</p>
<p>但時代是在進步的，因此對於勞工問題，也要比前用更多的注意，所以雇用勞工就要援用心理學的原理。這一種工作的目的，就是要知道勞工方面的心理是否健全，是否能够適合工作上的需要。</p>
<p>向來雇用勞工，並沒有經過測騐，因此往往有良莠不齊的現象，如果經過了測騐，再加以訓練，那末可以使工人的工作程度有一個標準，這在工作的進行和生產方面，都有極大的關係，同時這一種方法，不但適應於勞工，即使是職員方面，也可以應用的，所以我們可以統稱做雇員心理。</p>

<p>根據醫學家硏究所得，亞米諾酸共有二十多種，但主要的共有十種，這十種亞米諾酸，不能缺少一種，如果再加入適量的維他命和礦物質，就可以成爲補品中最補的一種。</p>

<h3 id="c148">秋暮蒼涼話西湖 <a href="#c148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>— 趙清閣</p>
<p>旅行原是一件快活的事，而且我生平最愛旅行，但這次我竟一點也不快活。許多天來，各方面的氣壓低得使我窒息，我載着沉重的心情，陪幾位朋友勉强到了杭州，雖然這兒是山靑水秀的風景區，我的心情却並不因此稍感輕鬆。當我投進西子懷抱的時候，久別重逢的歡愉，霎時化爲了一股烟，一股包含着萬千人事滄桑的烟。於是，我流下幾滴傷感的淚！</p>
<p>廿三年的秋天，爲了畢業寫生，我以一個學生的身份帶着興奮的心情，第一次到了杭州，那是和許多美專的同學住在環湖路上的惠中旅館。成天提着一隻油畫箱到處寫生，而最使我流連忘返的，是西泠橋頭的蘇小小墓亭，和孤山下放鶴亭前的曼殊墳。因此我繪了兩幅紀念畫，一幅是「西泠橋上月」，取景還依稀記得是一片恬靜的湖光上橫着一架有半月洞的石橋，橋頭斜角的蘇小小墓亭凄涼地伴着一株垂柳，冷月一勾掛在柳梢頭上。另一幅是「孤山詩魂」。取景好像是以曼殊的墳爲重心，墳上聳立一隻泥塑的白鶴，孤山懷抱着埋葬了詩人的墳園，一角馮小靑的墓亭减去了曼殊不少的岑寂。詩魂伴着詩魂，西子在一邊助長他們的詩興。這兩幅畫算是我相當滿意的作品，可惜保存到戰爭發生，終於毁滅在砲火裏了。爲了小時候讀了不少關於蘇小小的詩文，所以非常憐愛她。特別是曼珠，我讀過不少她的小說，信札，對於他的思想性格以及身世遭遇，都深深地欽佩與同情。常常在日暮黃昏，我一個人躺在他的墳前，作種種無涯的遐想。有時我帶着一支洞簫，坐在他的墳頭上靜靜地吹奏，我嘗天眞地希望過，能用這幽塲的樂聲喚醒他的酣寢，把他那一縷詩魂再縴回到這個世界上來！我是那樣誠摯地哀悼他，懷念他。當時在杭州躭擱了一個多星期，除了遊覽湖上的一些風景名勝以外，還去過靈隱。韜光。天竺·九溪十八澗·虎跑等處。也去過錢塘，畫了一幅「錢塘塔影」。見取景錢塘江與六和塔。（這幅畫便被學校選作了畢業的成績。）但在這些所有去過的風景名勝地方裏面，我還是比較喜歡和留戀西泠橋和孤山。</p>
<p>第二次到杭州是廿五年的秋大同文一道，心情是悠閒的。我們就住在西泠橋頭的蝶來飯店，於是我更得朝夕的偎依着蘇小小的墓亭，過了橋，傍着西湖走一段短短的草地，便是曼殊的墳園。這次我雖然沒有帶畫箱，却帶了攝影機，因此我又在這裏拍了幾張照片。我們遊覽所有杭州的風景各勝，我們常常到肅穆莊嚴的岳墳廟內品茗談天。我們划着小舟往凈寺，在月下老人的塑像前，求些個令人發笑而又羞澀的籤文。我們赴劉莊對酌賞菊，微醺而後已。我們披着月光，盪漾湖心中，高歌，或默默沉思。我們曾步行至玉泉寺，雙脚蹂着珍珠池邊的石頭震動出成串的水泡，比賽着看誰的成績好。我們競走上靈隱；爬雙峯；趨韜光；登天竺；一路碧綠成蔭，翠竹爲伍，野花黃白點綴，格外風趣可人，我不禁贊賞江南的秋比華北的春還要嫩，還要嫵媚。我們又攀山越嶺渡過九溪十八澗，沿途驚呌着前而彷彿是絕路！我們用虎跑泉的水泡龍井的茶，淸香滌去了無限心靈的風塵！我們那樣盡興的玩；縱情的樂；我們忘記了窘困；忘記了疲倦；我們好像不知道憂愁爲何物，我們的心還是年靑的哩！</p>
<p>想不到十二年後，第三次我又到了杭州，却依然是一個秋天。而如今，旅伴不同，心情不同，景况也不同了！美專的那些同學，散了！文，已經變成兩個孩子的母親，第一次的心情是興奮的，西子湖和我一樣生氣勃勃；第二次的心傷是悠閒的，西子湖和我一樣愉　，可是，這第三次的心情是蕭索的，西子湖和我一樣萎靡憔悴！</p>
<p>當和大家遊玩的時候，我總是械默寡言，我一直陷入茫茫的沉思中。我似逍憶過去曾失悼的什麼；也似悲傷一切灰黯的現實；又似展望些未來飄渺的憧憬！總之，我對一草，一花，一石，一水，都有着萬千的感慨，我說不淸我那漫無邊際的遐想，我的情緒昏亂而又眩惑，我鐵一頭山野裏迷了路的羔羊！</p>
<p>第一眼使我難過的是，西泠橋頭上的蘇小小墓亭，途上了煞風景的醜陋的紅顏色。岳廟的大門也有着同樣惡劣的記號。抗日的革命女烈士秋瑾祠堂已經無踪迹了，只賸下一座凋零的紀念塔。我彷彿覺得這都是敵僞所給予我們的詩魂與國魂的侮辱！</p>
<p>第二眼使我難過的是，受殊的墳園變成了一片荒墟，墳頭上的白鶴飛了，墳週圍的靑松翠柏不知去向，滿地盡是枯草，湖邊的殘荷更烘拖着萬分的凄楚！孤山問梅無消息！幾株枯桿矜持地佇立在荒墟上。放鶴亭無恙，但是亭下的博覽會橋拆了，據說爲日本人用作我築材料了。三潭印月和平湖秋月的亭台閣榭，都破爛不堪，顯然多年失修的樣子，令人不勝觸目蒼涼之感！</p>
<p>劉莊的景物還有着舊日富麗堂皇的痕迹，但也是滿室塵垢堆積，滿園荒草瀰漫。昔日的菊花盛况沒有了，一池死水僅留着幾根殘荷萎華。</p>
<p>大家都想去訪候凈寺的月下老人，有一位朋友還要急於問卜一個喜訊的籤文。但是舟子吿訴我們凈寺也被日本人拆了，月下老人葬身火穴中！聽見這消息，誰都無限惋惜！誰都爲這位專作好事的紅綫使者——月下老人叫屈！洪深先生很幽默地說：「怪不得今日悲劇多，原來月下老人壽終正寢，有情人無人縴綫，於是都成不了眷屬！」翰笙更講得妙，他願月下老人顯個靈騐，罰日本男子盡成鰥夫！</p>
<p>這一回沒有去九溪十八澗，只到了靈隱。在濟公佛像前大家求籤問運道；問財氣；問安寗；問時局。洪深先生爲問艮主求一上吉籤，大意吿訴他：有志者事竟成。於是他立刻許下宏誓大願，一旦艮主實現，常籌金條建廟宇，答謝菩薩。大家爲這個渺茫的希望歡樂了，述老和尙都哈哈大笑起來！我也求了一個問禍福的籤，籤文上的首句是：「無風無雨忽聞雷」，我心裏不禁跳了幾跳。天，像我這樣一個緘默冷靜的人，難道也還要平日無辜地遭受無風無雨的雷擊嗎？我不信，但我却有些怕！</p>
<p>來不及再去韜光，天竺，歸途玩了玉泉寺，大家在珍珠池的沿口跥水泡。我沒有，我的心沉朮得像要一跥就掉下去的樣子。</p>
<p>最後進謁岳墳，秦檜夫婦還長跪在岳老夫子的面前，我這時想：爲什麼不再添塑兩個銅像，讓汪精衛夫婦也跪向我們的岳武穆懺悔懺悔呢。</p>
<p>薄暮時分，走出岳廢，鐘聲鏗然，驚破我一佩白日的惡夢！</p>
<p>行將離去的淸晨，我獨自漫步於綠柳爲林的白堤。西湖平靜無波，秋風起處，一片落葉飄散在水面上。遊人寥寥，小舟寂寞地停泊堤岸下，航影搖拽着像一羣游魚。幾聲幽　的鳥叫，像幾聲嘆息，彷彿沉吟着：</p>
<p>『十年風雨，病了西子湖！十年滄桑，老了西子湖！十年闊別，故人已非舊心情！十年夢，一般沮喪！』</p>
<p>我無聲地掉下幾滴淚！歟默地祈禱着：願第四次再來的時候，西子湖已經恢復了健康；恢復了年靑；我也恢復了快活；整個宇宙都恢復了和平幸福的景象！</p>

<p>— 齊哴</p>
<p>剛纔看到申報「春秋」鮑先生的「施耐庵在白駒塲」一文，不啻對於耐庵的身世做了一回見證，眞是高興之至</p>
<p>一位興化人吳先生，名字恕我記不起了，吿訴過我，耐庵就住在典化草垠鎭，離城九十里，鎭上很多姓施的，是耐庵的子孫。據我們說，耐庵原是中州人，元朝末年，張士誠起兵，他帮助士誠，後來士誠失敗，朱元璋做了皇帝，猜忌好殺，他就住在草垠鎭，不出來了。</p>
<p>記得看過一種什麽「澄江舊話」，誰作的可也忘了，仿彿有這麽一段；耐庵字子安，淮安人，元順帝時賜進士，爲江陰徐姓墊師，嘗官錢塘，張士贓據高郵，徵之，不起，士誠敗，耐庵亦死云云。</p>
<p>一位胡先生曾經向我證實，他到過東台白駒橋，査過白駒橋施姓族譜，譜上所載正是這樣，於今讀鮑先生這篇文章，知道白駒橋係白駒塲之誤。而白駒塲有耐庵的堂房後裔，有耐庵的祠堂，有施公墓，草垠鎭又有耐庵子孫，耐庵的晚年當在興化東台之間度過的。</p>
<p>胡應麟莊嶽委談稱耐庵爲武林施某，大概聽說他在錢塘做過官，纔這麽說。又說他恁樣寫水滸傳，門人羅某亦效之爲三國志。李卓吾百二十回本水滸傳，題着施集撰，羅纂修，金聖歡七十回本，辯正七十回以後爲羅貫中橫添狗尾。耐庵與貫中旣爲師弟，創作上又有這些模仿和合作，他們該是常常在一起的，王圻續文獻通考謂貫中爲杭州（東都）人，據此，或者耐庵原籍巾州，而做官，敎書，著作，在南方的時間反而久些。</p>
<p>他是北人，而且是賜進士，他可不滿意腐敗的朝政。或者他是南人，當時南人是比北人還低的，他受不了種種侮辱和迫害，張士誠在白駒塲起義，他就參加。「徵之不起」，這話恐不可靠。耐庵子孫怕朱元璋看到耐庵帮士誠而慘殺其家族，祇好寫着「不起」，其實「起」了。</p>
<p>之後，士誠敗死，耐庵回到他所紀念的白駒塲，把他對於黑暗政治的反抗從戰塲移到文塲，於是產生了水滸傳，是很可能的吧？</p>
<p>無書可考，姑且記下來，將以質之高明。好在東台興化不遠，將來實地考察，也不是難的。</p>
<h3 id="c152">施耐庵與張士誠 <a href="#c152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>— 王者興</p>
<p>讀本刋十月二十九日鮑雨君：「施耐庵在白駒塲」一文，對水滸傳作者施耐庵曾在蘇北興化東台間之白駒塲故事，有所記載。鮑君並親歷其地，看到施先生之祠堂及其後裔，而對此一代偉大作者憑弔，令人不勝嚮往。</p>
<p>施耐庵在興化最久，因白駒屬於興化東陲一名鎭，故興化人久經將施先生認作興化籍。鮑雨君謂施係洛陽人，當有所根據，不過照筆者所論斷，或者施耐庵原籍是洛陽，但旅居興化以至於老死，年代悠久，實已無異乎屬於興化籍了。</p>
<p>因爲談到施耐庵之在白駒，所以不得不提起一位曾經在蘇州稱王而爲老百姓所愛戴至今不忘的張士誠。而施耐庵又與張士誠有極深淵源，張並係白駒人，故很有一述的價値。</p>
<p>張士誠乳名「小四」，興化白駒人，白駒爲濱海一鹽塲，張微時即以販鹽爲業，與施耐庵曾同事一老師，學習文事和武藝，兩人的工夫很不相上下。當元末的時候，朝政不綱，政治腐敗，天下羣雄崛起，他們兩人頗以挽救國家撫輯人民爲職志。後來張士誠據蘇州稱吳王，施耐庵則參佐樞密，贊襄戎幕，建樹極多。無奈後來許多獻策未能實施，他們兩人間也就互相猜疑起來，終於施耐庵捨棄故人而去，到江陰一個大地主家作西席。這一代吳王失去了臂助，很影響後來的成敗，然而施耐庵所遺留下來的規模，使張士誠始終的愛民如子，這種德政，恐怕非同時的朱元璋陳友諒所可及，惜乎張施未能合作到底，不然或許那時候的天下，不會爲一個和尙所有。</p>
<p>施耐庵在江陰某大地主家除敎授學生以外，看了主人的財力雄厚，很可以作一番大事業，便極力敦勸主人起義，也招集了許多志士和鄕勇，積極訓練。詎主人後以志趣不同，未能及時崛起，施很替其惋惜，乃怏怏然引去。可是，江陰的民氣，却從此蓬勃發揚，後來的抗倭禦賊以及諸死難死節的英烈事跡，無不由此而啓發的。</p>
<p>施耐庵離別江陰以後，覺到大勢已去，天下將屬朱明，乃回到老家白駒，閉門著書，於是此一偉大著作——水滸傳，便產生出來了。水辯傳的筆法生動而深刻，有人說很像史記。的確，施耐庵的胸懷鬱悶，也與司馬遷心中的憤滿差不多，所以他們的作品都在抒憤而已。假設施耐庵在那時能够風雲得意，咤叱一世，那決沒有餘暇來作水滸傳了，這却是我們後人的福分。說句私話，幸喜施耐庵先生一生未能得意，否則他的功業雖彪炳，而其在文學上定不能放此奇葩。百姓老眼看着古今來所謂英雄豪傑的王業覇業够受了，他們說倒不如閑來一壺淸茶，讀讀水滸傳的好！</p>

<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>到了溪邊，我忽然吃了一大驚，聽得禁衛區內，好像有幾聲犬吠。我問虎弟聽見沒有，他好像心不在焉的說：「狗想必總是有的吧。」我也想到，但凡有日寇的地方，也少不了惡狗，這日寇訓練過的狗，兇惡殘暴，不僅能够循味追踪，跳躍搏噬，並且巧於偸襲，誘敵，報警，格鬥。不讓咬住便罷，一下咬住，便不得脫身，而且一聞血腥，就會變成野獸一般，非得將人撕碎，嚙嚼幾塊。</p>
<p>這時已經七點多鐘，天已入暮，雲頭甚低，兩三丈外，不火能辨別景物的細微，祇是一片漠糊。我們隱藏在這溪邊的野叢裏、計劃跨過這道溪流。虎弟就手在地上拾了幾片小石，從近到遠，將小石逐一投到水裏，見那泡沫翻起的速度，知道溪水不深。至多淹齊半人高。</p>
<p>「小姨，我前邊走！」虎弟把斜掛在身邊的小口袋，拴在　子上，兩枝手槍，一手一枝，側過身來，看了我一眼，便探步下水。我也拾授爽利，四面掃了一眼，跟在虎弟後面，也下水一步一探走着，虎弟雖說比我小了八九歲，身個幾乎比我高着半寸，我們兩人都能游泳；這水倒沒什麽可怕，可恨就是那溪底的汚泥，任你怎麽提着氣，脚下總要陷下去半尺，一步一拔，眞有些費勁。最深的地方，水已經浸到腰下了。喜得並非死水，並無氣味，反正我的衣服已經呌汗濕透，倒也不大難過</p>
<p>到了岸邊，因爲是一片土坡，毫無掩護，我們祗好傴樓身體，順着坡的斜度，蠕動着，一步一步上去。剛剛爬到石牆根脚，只見閃電一般，一股豪光從對岸野叢，跨過溪水，橫掃到牆根脚。這突如其來的探照燈光，把我驚得一身冷汗，一顆心跳得幾乎頂住了咽喉。我同虎弟，同時木能的一伸手，彼此一邀攔，像要把我們的身子，按壓到牆根裏面去似的。</p>
<p>「咦，給鬼子看見哪？」虎弟悄沒聲的驚詫着。</p>
<p>「不見得，」我呌虎弟安心，「這光好像是那邊橋頭發出的，不是嗎？」</p>
<p>我們倆都把背靠住石牆，坐在牆根，腿子順着斜坡直伸着，儘量减少目標。這時簡直不能亂動，只有靜待事態的發展。諜探訓練的七字訣，這裏倒用得着「冷」與「忍」兩字。</p>
<p>我們地面靜待，一面各人都把兵器，偸偸握住在手，也許一秒鐘後，就要子彈像雨點般對着掃射起來。這時最用得着的是耳，其次是目，所以我把精神聚會在聽與視的兩個官覺上。雖說膽大神淸，到底也覺得心口不住怦怦的跳動。我們這時的感覺，很像兩隻糜鹿，被獵犬拌制着，祇有準備着死鬥。</p>
<p>我想最多五六分鐘模樣，那探照燈又照前橫掃過來。我聽得虎弟用悄沒得聽不見的小聲自言自語說：他媽的，有種就跑過來，弄這鬼火吓唬誰？」</p>
<p>正在這時候，聽得石牆那邊，遠遠地有軍靴踏在石子路上的步聲，好像只有一個人，從橋頭的那邊，走向我們這裏來，步子很慢。一會兒又聽見有咻咻的唏噓，好像一隻龐大的猛獸，發出的一種威猛氣息，夾着　沉重的脚步，愈來愈離我們這事近了。</p>

<p>— 少夫</p>
<p>中央信託局第二次標售敵僞房地產卅九個單位的公吿，業於前天刋佈了，同日，這卅九個單位中的住戶出緊要啓事；雙方弓弦刀鞘，形勢十分緊張，　件事如果處置失當，極可能引出意外來。</p>
<p>昨天，信託局與處理局兩局負責人對此事曾發表意見，新聞的第一段稱：</p>
<p>「勝利以還，本市房荒嚴重，中央信託局爲協助政府解決居住困難起見，曾擬墊建房屋，分宅出售，　計經費四百億元，由國家行局及商業行莊組設銀團，並經擬興建築墊款辦法，提交四聯總處核示。此項計劃，甫於十月廿四日經該處第三二五次理事會通過，在未付實施前……（下面講到要標賣了）。」</p>
<p>喏喏，你們看，政府已在爲你們設法了，不過在未付實施前，先賣出這批房地產罷了，喏喏，你們眞不織抬舉呀！</p>
<p>立刻有失居無家的痛苦，叫這般人又怎能識抬舉呢？這般人旣不是蠶貨，又不是童騃，然而信託局是叫他們丟掉急待飽肚子的手中的大餅而構想明年的滿漢筵席。</p>
<p>能不能就拿這筆四百億元買進這批房屋，而出租給原來住在裏面的房客呢？集籌建標售爲一事，這是最賢明的辦法，而又完成了政府解決小民居住困難的目的，想賢明的信託局處理局，定可考慮及此的。</p>

<h3 id="c155">閒話地震 <a href="#c155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>— 錦霞</p>
<p>報載：二日下午東京西北發生四小時之强烈地震。</p>
<p>這里，且順便談談地震：</p>
<p>地球始終不息的有各種微小分子的遝動，平常不容易爲人類察覺，因爲道種震動，極其輕微；但在特殊情形之下，起了劇烈的變動，這就是地震。</p>
<p>地震的原因有三：火山爆發，地層陷落和地層斷裂。</p>
<p>火山爆發時，附近地方受到震動，坍屋傷人，但地震限於火山區域以內，爲害較小。地層陷落是地殼中的石灰岩，受了地下水的浸蝕作用，一部份的礦物質被溶解，成了空洞和裂隙，支持力减削，遂向下陷，造成陷落地震。地球遂漸冷凝收縮，發生摺曲的現象，使地球的深內層起了裂縫，地屏沿了深巨的裂縫上下移動，便產生震域最廣，强度最烈的地層斷裂的地震。</p>
<p>記錄</p>
<p>有史以來，就有地震發生，時至今日，依然隨時隨地，都有發生地震的可能。過去，單以法國地震學者拜祿所收集的各國地震紀錄，已有十七萬次之多，分別統計的結果，發現慣常地震的地方，一爲環太平洋四週，一爲沿地中海，阿爾卑斯山，高加索而至喜馬拉雅山兩大區域。</p>
<p>近廿年以內，發生地震的國家計有：土耳某，日本，智利，羅馬尼亞，美國，中國，保加利亞，南斯拉夫，阿根廷，蘇聯，墨西哥，法國，義大利，印度，希臘等十五國。</p>
<p>慘極</p>
<p>以下是幾次傷亡最重，損失最鉅的地震紀錄：一九二三年日本的東京大地震，東京死八萬四千餘人，橫濱也遭波及，死傷四萬餘人。一九三九年一月二十四日，智利南部發生猛烈地震，災區遍及十數城，二十萬居民之中，罹難者竟佔百分之二十五—即五萬人，全燬者，計有九個城。一九四〇年十一月十日，東南歐洲大地震，以羅馬尼亞首當其衝，死傷民衆一萬餘人，十二層巨　卡爾登公寓，爲羅國京城內最堅固的鋼骨水泥建築物，也被震坍，旅客葬身瓦礫堆中，爲數極多，但該公寓守夜人，値班時適逢地震發作，遂用重毯裏身護頭，由十二層高樓跳下，雖受重傷，仍向救火會報警。我國災情最慘的一次地震，是甘肅大地震，共死二十餘萬人，崩坍之地，竟有長三四千尺，闊兩千尺，深四五百尺者多處，房屋人畜盡被掩覆。</p>
<p>虛驚</p>
<p>也有僅僅令人飽受虛驚，却無人命損失的地震，一九四二年六月二十九日深夜，智利京城突然發生劇烈地震數次，居民驚恐之餘，跣足裸體，爭先奔到街道中央，佇立多時，地震忽吿停息，無一死傷。巴黎在一九四〇年三月間，曾發生連續不已的輕微地震，市民多高臥未起，竟不知有此等事，翌晨讀報，方才呼出一口氣。</p>
<p>雖然同是地震，也有幸與不幸的分別。</p>
<h3 id="c156">加薪　加乎哉？不加也！ <a href="#c156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>報上見到中樞決議調整公敎人員薪給了，區區所在地的常州，叨列第二等，照標準算一算，月入可以到十多萬了，正做着如何添衣易着的美夢，但事實把我驚醒了過來。</p>
<p>在兩月前的時光吧，在同一報的差不多同樣的地位上，看到了調整公敎人員待這的消息，江蘇區的標準是底數是五萬五千元，加成二百四十倍，比當時原標準增加了約三分之二，聞訊之下，也曾打算如何添衣如何購鞋，可是等着，等着，中央級實行了，省級也實行了，伹却「到此爲止」。我們因爲是　級，竟沒有資格受到惠。同事們常自相問着：是不是因爲縣級公務員比上面的公務員事情就少做一點呢？顯然不是的！我會有機會與地方長官談到過這問題，他吿訴我，理由是地方收入不足，　收實支，標準雖加却無款可加。這我相信是事實，伹是我要問當局：在決議時是否認爲標準定後，省級以下公務員假使地方收入不足便可以不管的？抑根本沒有考慮到標準定後，地方會無款可付，所以也就不設法補助，使決議能行？在沒有明瞭這答案以前，我不敢對此次的調整有什麼希望。</p>
<p>今天一位朋友碰到我，帶着肯定的話　問我：「加薪乎？」「不加也！一　只能暫時這樣問答。</p>

<p>三毛弟弟：</p>
<p>我很敬佩你的能幹，你雖然是一個天眞活潑未成年的兒童，伹是，你的志氣，智謀，果敢……却處處像成人。不，甚至連成人都不及你，尤其是處世方面，你乃能自如地應付着，活躍於長官同志之間，這使我驚奇你是一個不平凡的兒童，也是超過於一般兒童的特點，正因着你的年輕，所以常常受着上司們的凌辱，同志的欺侮，但是，你並不氣餒，並不怨恨……仍然剛毅地站定着自身的崗位，把握着自身的責任，運用你愛國智謀，處處予敵人打擊。</p>
<p>當你卸去了軍服，辭別了長官以後，踏上社會征途時，那V字形的歧路，正逼着你，無所適從地呆立着，俯首瞧着路旁的十字義塚，盡是戰死沙塲的鬥士。這裏有你過去相處的同志，也有建功立勳光榮成仁的志士和名標靑史的烈士，而今，他們都默默的長眼於九泉之下了。我想，你心中也會感到無限的悲哀，伹是當你翹首看着V字的尖端時，恐怕你會感到比死更難受的痛苦—失業，那佈滿着蛛網的屋偶之一角，高矗的烟囱，正是封閉着的工廠—（做工無工可做），另一面則所謂「復員還鄉」的家鄕，殘餘的枯樹，望不見屋宇，也看不見炊烟。當我看到你居無處，饑無食的時候，不禁爲你吸一口冷氣，難道爲國效勞了數載，就含糊一無保障，落得如此下塲嗎？你眞是太年靑了，自然，對於世態的炎涼，人情的冷暖，無澈底的了解，然而，你也不必悲觀，這正是你體嘗到眞諦的人生，也是吿訴你「自力更生」的警鐘。我希望你本着以往投軍時的意志，忍耐着，一次失敗再來一次，直至成功爲止，在人生世事的不平道上，只許進不許退！</p>

<p>— 洛</p>
<p>周逆佛海已於最近公開受審了，據說受審的那一天，把首都高等法院的木凳都擠壞了。怪不得周逆感到十分的尷尬。偶然翻閱周逆在敵僞時期的傑作「往矣集」，在「走火記」裏，周逆自述其在偽府時代寓所被火燒的經過，如今在周逆成爲「待決之囚」的時候讀起來，着實替周逆寒心。原文節抄如下：—</p>
<p>「燒得正猛烈的時候，第一個親來慰問和照料的，便是汪夫人，她聽見這個消息，立即就跑來照料，並恐怕我們沒有棲身之所，立即電話民誼，把他的房子，空出幾間。因爲民誼夫人去上海，房子可以空得出。隨着她又陪着我們到了民誼家中，……」</p>
<p>以上幾句話，敎那些「因果家」或拆字先生分析起來，我們實在爲周逆今後的「去處」寒心。褚民誼已經被正法了，「汪夫人」還要介紹周逆去住褚逆的鬼屋。周逆之叛國，多少也是陳逆璧君拉綫拉來的。想想多麼寒心啊。</p>
<p>在「四遊北平經感」裏，周逆自述民國廿九年僞府還都後赴平，當地斷絕行人交通以歡迎他的盛况。</p>
<p>「伹是在三十多年以前，就是王公大臣出門，也不見得完全斷絕交通。我以一個窮學生，竟在數百年帝王之都，出入斷絕交通起來，下意識也之禁引以自豪。然而不是在三十多年以前這樣。不是在中國統一的時候這樣，實覺美中不足」。</p>
<p>其實呢，那時僞府的奸逆動輒被刺殺。所以紙有以斷絕交通來維特治安。周逆居然「自康」起來。不怕讀者毛骨悚然乎？</p>
<p>「廣州之行」裏，周逆又述</p>
<p>「……十一時起飛，繞香港入珠江流域，經香港的時候，回想二十七年十二月與公博河內飛到九能，思平到機塲去接的情形，猶歷歷在目。……」</p>
<p>周逆眞是多情善感慨。陳逆梅逆現在都在陰間飛機塲等着你。請你耐性佇候見而罷。</p>

<p>— 幼南</p>
<p>……新任農工部長……</p>
<p>勝利後在南京躭過的，一定都熟悉二度主京的馬超俊。</p>
<p>南京這個市，當市長當然很難；第一，國府所在，中外觀瞻所繫，一個冷不防，就要挨駡。勝利後，南京總是不大起勁似地，街道路旁，凌亂而無生氣，記得當蔣主席首次凱旋還都時，對京市一切，都不示滿意。伹是在京市府方面說來，却是錢少事多，種種困難。</p>
<p>兩馬相鬥</p>
<p>馬市長任內，最轟動南京的一件事，是京中央日報提倡禁舞時的一篇文章，那題目呌「接受市政府的挑釁」，文里說「馬市長治下的南京，顯然是向提倡節約的我們挑釁」，文巾最激烈的句子有「你死我活」的字樣，一時，弄得馬市長頗難爲情。這事，當時由京副市長馬元放出而調停，大剛報做了題目說：「兩馬相鬥，另馬調停。」（按，京中央日報社長爲馬星野）</p>
<p>平心而諭，馬市長治下的南京，未盡人意者確是不少。現在，京市易長，馬先生調任農工部長，我們希望京市與農工部，都能深慶得人。</p>
<p>按馬氏以其致力工人運動十年的硏究心得，馬氏編著有：「中國勞工問題」，「中國國民黨農工政策」，「工資物價指數表」，「農產物價指數表」等書，皆係在百忙中，偸閒所成。今日所調任新職，我想自應更適宜於馬氏的才幹。</p>
<p>馬超俊又名馬共，廣東台山籍，早歲在香港「庇利機械專門學校」畢業後，東渡入日本明治大學肄業，奔走革命事業，始於光緒三十三年，當時馬氏在粤省欽廉鼓吹革命，曾被地方官郭人璋逮捕，得美國牧師夏士古保釋，當黃花岡七十二烈士舉義前，馬氏曾以炸藥藏在髪中（當時尙行長髪繞辮），由香港運至廣州接濟革命黨人，竟未被發覺。</p>
<p>武昌起事，馬氏充任敢死隊長，駐守漢陽兵工廠。民國二年，會被誣由黎元洪氏下命禁於湖北陸軍監獄，歷時四月，方得釋放。</p>
<p>領導工運</p>
<p>民國十年以後，馬先生拋却武裝，專一致力工人運動及敎育，被選爲廣州市政參事。十一年陳逆烱明叛變，馬先生和夫人沈慧蓮　　，曾保護孫夫人出險，事平，國父　　先生爲大本營宣傳委員，不久調任廣東　工廠長。十四年三月，國父北上，　病天津，病起以至逝世，馬先生始終隨侍在側，親牽湯藥。</p>
<p>十八年，馬氏常選由央執行委員，四月，奉派出席日內瓦國際勞工大會，提議「有色人種應與各會員國平等侍遇」，以堅持不屈的精神，卒獲通過。</p>
<p>馬先生第一次任南京市畏是在民國二十四年四月，勝利後，仍復原職。</p>
<p>在南京，給我印象最深刻的是馬氏和他的太太（沈慧蓮），兩兒都是老大塊頭，在招待盟友的舞會中，他們倆兒的「大塊舞」，總是引起哄堂大笑的。</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 3rd] The National Government issued an order on the 4th, specially appointing Wang Shijie and Wang Huacheng as plenipotentiary representatives for negotiating the Sino-American Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 3rd] The State Department announced on the 3rd that the United States and China have signed a Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation in Nanjing, with a term of five years. A State Department official solemnly declared to United Press reporters that the U.S. government's signing of this treaty at this time has absolutely no political significance. The signatories for the United States were Ambassador to China Stuart, and U.S. Special Commissioner and Consul General in Tianjin Smith. The treaty consists of 10,000 words, covering a wide range of topics. It will take effect upon ratification by the U.S. Senate and the Chinese Legislative Yuan. This treaty is based on the principle of mutual benefit and equality. The rights enjoyed by U.S. individuals and companies in China can also be enjoyed by Chinese individuals and companies in the United States. All rights are clearly and thoroughly stipulated in the treaty. This treaty replaces the existing nine treaties between the two countries, such as the initial Treaty of Peace, Friendship and Commerce signed on July 3, 1844.</p>
<p>Eliminating Traces of Extraterritoriality; Stipulating Principles of Mutual Business</p>
<p>U.S. officials stated that there are several reasons why the United States and China must sign this treaty, one of which is to eliminate the last traces of so-called extraterritoriality. The new treaty aims to stipulate the principles for mutual business operations between the two countries in a clear and legal manner. The rights obtained by U.S. companies in China have been slightly expanded as a result. However, due to the ongoing internal turmoil in China, most of the expanded rights obtained by U.S. businesses currently exist only on paper and cannot be implemented. The new treaty allows companies and associations of citizens of one country to "reside, travel, and conduct business" in various parts of the other country, and to engage in "commercial, manufacturing, scientific, educational, religious, and charitable activities" that are not prohibited by the laws of the other country. They may also "acquire, possess, construct, or lease suitable buildings" and lease land to carry out the above activities. Americans can form and join companies with Chinese people in China, and vice versa in the United States. The "most-favored-nation" principle appears frequently in the new treaty. The new treaty also stipulates that if one of the two countries grants any rights to individuals or companies of a third country to explore and develop mineral resources, the same rights must be granted to the other signatory country. According to the "freedom of commerce and navigation" clause, merchant ships of one country can navigate the territorial waters of the other country and dock at various ports, but warships and fishing boats are not included in this provision.</p>

<h3 id="e14">Behind-the-Scenes Figure on Siam's Political Stage; Pridi Arrives in Nanjing for Visit; Departs China for England After Three-Day Stay <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 3rd] Former Prime Minister and Regent of Siam, Pridi Banomyong, accompanied by his wife and staff, and escorted by Sun Binggan, section chief of our Ministry of Foreign Affairs, flew to Nanjing from Siam on the 3rd afternoon at 5:00 PM on a U.S. Pacific Overseas Airlines special plane. Li Jun, Director of Protocol of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Yang Yunzhu, Director of the Asian Department, Feng Zongyao representing Wu Tiecheng, and Feng Erhe, a Siamese community leader, all went to welcome them. After Pridi got off the plane, he shook hands with the welcoming personnel one by one, and then took a special car prepared by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to the official residence of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to rest. According to Pridi, he is visiting China, England, and the United States in a private capacity. Your country's victory in the war of resistance has raised its international status, and it is honored as one of the five great powers. He is here for a visit in order to see the new China after the war. He plans to stay in Nanjing for three days, visit various leaders, and then leave China for England. Others accompanying him include Luan Sukun, Director of the Siamese Propaganda Department. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is preparing a grand welcome for Pridi's visit to China, which will enhance friendly relations between the two countries.</p>
<p>[Another Telegram] Pridi Banomyong, a Siamese elder statesman who arrived in Nanjing for a visit on the 3rd, is the powerful leader of Siam and the behind-the-scenes manipulator on Siam's political stage. He was formerly known as Luan Balik. "Luan" in Siam means "Viscount." Luan Balik automatically canceled his title and restored his original name, Pridi Banomyong, after the June 1932 coup. He is originally from Chaozhou, Guangdong, with the surname Chen. Few people know his Chinese name. He does not use a Chinese name and does not acknowledge being Chinese because he was born in Siam. According to Siamese law, any foreigner born in Siam is considered Siamese. Pridi has never been to China. He studied law in France. He is talented and capable. After returning to Siam from France, he joined the government and held a considerable position. He was the mastermind of the June coup, and the coup plan was completed under his guidance. After the coup, he became a powerful leader in Thailand. The following year, Pridi drafted a "New Economic Policy" advocating that the government buy land and then distribute it to the people for cultivation, turning farmers into government employees. The People's Assembly believed that this policy had communist overtones, and he was considered leftist. At that time, Siamese law outlawed communism. Pridi could not stand his ground and had to flee abroad. Later, the Siamese government organized a review committee to examine whether he was truly a communist. The result was that he was not considered leftist, so his "crime" of being a communist was revoked, and he returned to the Siamese political stage, serving as Minister of Foreign Affairs and Minister of Finance. When the European War broke out in 1939, he saw the British power gradually declining and the Japanese power expanding in Asia. Therefore, he frequently courted Japan, trying to win their favor. At that time, overseas Chinese in Siam, motivated by patriotism, rose up to boycott Japanese goods and donate money to save the country. Under Pridi's behind-the-scenes guidance, the Luan Phibuns government used high-handed means to prevent the patriotic actions of overseas Chinese. Antih Kwang-eng, chairman of the Bangkok Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, died tragically for leading donations and other patriotic actions. Based on this policy, Siam also concluded a treaty of alliance with Japan. As a result, when the Pacific War broke out, Siam invaded Burma and Malaya through Japan, and declared war on Britain and the United States. In the late stages of the war, Pridi saw that the situation was not good. On the one hand, he superficially perfunctorily dealt with Japan, and on the other hand, he communicated with the Allied countries. Domestically, he led an underground organization called "Free Thai," secretly resisting Japan. Abroad, he sent "Free Thai" personnel to be stationed in England, the United States, and China. When the victory was achieved last year, Pridi was the regent. In order to wash away its guilt of colluding with Japan, the Siamese government immediately issued a declaration declaring that the declaration of war against Britain and the United States was "illegal" and invalid." It sent a delegation to Kandy, the headquarters of the Allied Forces in Southeast Asia, to negotiate a "treaty to eliminate the state of war." As a result, the Anglo-Siamese Treaty was signed. Because of the generous support of the United States, Siam, in addition to compensating Britain for all the losses suffered by British interests in Siam during the war and allowing the Allied countries to control its main products—rice, teak, tin, and rubber—was not subjected to very severe sanctions. When the late King returned to the country from Switzerland last December, Pridi resigned as regent. The People's Assembly then resolved to give him the title of "Elder." He reached such a lofty position, but he is only about forty-seven years old. Pridi manipulated Siamese politics behind the scenes, and in the spring of this year, he encountered his first resistance. A coup member known for his candor, directness, honesty, and democracy, Khuang Aphaiwong, united with some other coup members and stood up to oppose Pridi, saying he was "undemocratic" and attacking him as a "dictator." As a result, in March, Pridi came out from behind the scenes and took responsibility for governing head-on, taking the post of Prime Minister. Khuang and his comrades organized the "Democratic Party" and took an opposition stance in the People's Assembly. At the beginning of May this year, the new Siamese Constitution was promulgated, and the People's Assembly was changed from a unicameral system to a bicameral system. In the election of Upper House officials, the Pridi faction won an overwhelming victory, and almost all of the Upper House members were coup members he led. In June, King Ananda Mahidol suddenly collapsed and died, and people believed he was assassinated, blaming the government. Pridi was still the Prime Minister, and became a general target of attack. The Democratic Party took the opportunity to act, taking anti-Pridi action. Pridi used high-handed means to deal with it. He first declared a nationwide "emergency period," then implemented press censorship, controlled public opinion, and arrested anti-government" journalists, even People's Representatives and those suspected of being pro-government were also arrested, and the turbulent situation gradually calmed down. Although Pridi's ancestors were Chinese, he has no knowledge of the motherland and no goodwill towards overseas Chinese in Siam. Last September, Siamese military police massacred overseas Chinese in Bangkok. Several community leaders protested to Pridi, but not only did he not say that the actions of the Siamese military police were illegal, but he instead said that the overseas Chinese were wrong. His visit to China is a good opportunity for him to know how much goodwill we have towards Siam, and how magnanimous and tolerant the Chinese are. We have absolutely no territorial or other ambitions towards Thailand.</p>

<h3 id="e19">Yoshiko Kawashima's Case of Colluding with the Enemy: Hebei High Court Prosecutor Files Indictment; Full Text of Indictment Recounts Her Crimes <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 3rd] The famous female spy Jin Bihui (i.e., Yoshiko Kawashima) has been investigated by Cheng Sansheng, prosecutor of the Hebei High Court, who has concluded that the charges against her of colluding with the enemy and resisting her own country are significant. He has charged her on the 31st of last month in the criminal court of that court with violating Article 2, Paragraph 1, Item 1 of the Regulations for the Punishment of Traitors. The full text of the indictment is excerpted below:</p>
<p>Defendant Jin Bihui is the daughter of Prince Su of the abdicated Qing Dynasty. She was born in Japan and orphaned at the age of three. She was adopted by the Japanese Kawashima Naniwa, hence the name Yoshiko Kawashima. At the age of nine, she was re-recognized by the Japanese Tada Naru as her adoptive father, but was still raised by Kawashima. She studied at the Tokyo Women's Academy. In addition to her studies, she learned everything about politics, military affairs, languages, painting, horseback riding, shooting. She was proficient in swimming, running, skating, dancing, and driving cars and airplanes. Her ambition was to use the power of Japan to restore the imperial cause of the Aisin Gioro clan, because Prince Su had advocated Sino-Japanese friendship during his lifetime, recommending Kawashima Naniwa as a Qing court consultant. Kawashima was extremely pro-China and received preferential treatment from the Qing court. After the abdication of the Qing court, he sympathized with Prince Su. The defendant inherited her father's legacy and listened to Kawashima's teachings, regarding the National Revolution of our country as an enemy and constantly plotting resistance. In 1932, the defendant first returned to Shanghai and became very close to the Japanese Consulate and military attaché Tanaka. Later, when she went to Changchun, she carried many letters for Commander Tada. At that time, her brother Jin Bidong was the mayor of the puppet Manchukuo's Xinjing and concurrently the garrison commander, and later became the commander of the Dian'an guerrillas. He discussed with the defendant and Tada the affairs of building an army in Manchuria. The defendant participated in the incorporation of Chen Guorui's troops into the Dingguo Army and the resolution of Su Bingwen's troops guarding the railway. Later, she discussed with her nephew Yu Jing the plan to move the Manchu Emperor to the Rehe detached palace and then back to Beiping to restore the imperial cause. Because the Japanese army did not agree, she went to Tianjin and invested 30,000 yuan to open the Dongxinglou Restaurant as a place to contact the Japanese. Later, Tada was transferred to Tianjin as the head of the special service agency, and he contacted the defendant at the Dongxinglou to discuss Chinese issues, advocating the use of Wang Jingwei, and dispatched Gu Qian to contact him, proposing "South China to remain untouched, Central China to Wang, and North China to Zhu Chen." Later, when the Dongxinglou went bankrupt, the report again stated that when she came to Beiping, Usami was the president of the North China Transportation Company, and Ba Jiaxiang was the president of the Wude Newspaper, specializing in intelligence work with Li Xianglan, Nakagawa Shigeko, and others. At that time, the defendant interacted with them. Many people who attached themselves to the enemy for personal gain, such as Luo Qingshan, Zhu Fuchang, Yuan Guan, Jiang Yapeng, and others, all flocked to her and conspired to provide resources to the enemy, benefit the enemy, harm the country and the people. In 1935, the defendant returned to Japan once and broadcasted Sino-Japanese friendship on radio stations in Tokyo and Osaka. In 1941, she returned to Fukuoka, Japan. When Matsuoka Yosuke returned from Germany, the defendant personally welcomed him at the airport. Later, she went to Tokyo. When Wang Jingwei was in Japan, he studied Sino-Japanese issues with Toyama Mitsuru, advocating that cooperation with the central government was the only way to succeed. She also published an article titled "Chinese Affairs" in the Women's Public Opinion. She also launched a celebration and welcomed the puppet emperor with lanterns when he visited Japan for the second time. When the defendant returned to China from Japan, she used an exit permit issued by Prime Minister Konoe and forwarded by Prime Minister Tojo, and suggested to Tojo's wife to quickly seek peace. During her twelve years in this country, the defendant served as the president of the Beijing Manchurian Association, the chairman of the China Gold Mining Company, and the commander-in-chief of the North China People's Self-Defense Army, among other puppet positions. She has admitted this without hesitation, and there are photos, pictorials, and Xiaofang Hachiro's confession as evidence. The content of her actions was nothing more than contacting enemy and puppet personnel, using Japanese military force to achieve her dream of restoring the Manchu Qing Dynasty. Her crime of colluding with the enemy and plotting to resist her own country is significant and should constitute a violation of Article 2, Paragraph 1, Item 1 of the Regulations for the Punishment of Traitors.</p>

<h3 id="e24">Building Temples and Erecting Pagodas to Endure for Eternity; Comforting Orphans and Aiding the Young to Console Loyal Souls: Ministry of National Defense Requests Internal Affairs Ministry to Handle Three Matters <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 3rd] During the War of Resistance, many of our loyal and brave officers and soldiers sacrificed themselves for the country. In order to reward their merits, the government, through the former Military Affairs Commission, had previously consulted with the Ministry of Interior to build martyrs' shrines, memorial arches and pagodas, and hold national funerals, public funerals, and public cemeteries. In order to facilitate the application for pensions by the bereaved families, condolence inquiry offices were established in various townships, towns, and district offices, and teachers and staff of various schools were appointed as agents to handle the pension procedures on behalf of the bereaved families. The Ministry of National Defense believes that all of the above items need to be actively carried out and has sent a telegram to the Ministry of Interior requesting them to handle the following matters: (1) Regarding the establishment of condolence inquiry offices in various township and district offices, many provinces and counties have not yet reported their establishment, and none have been established in the recovered areas. Please reiterate the previous order and set a deadline for reporting their establishment within this year; (2) The funding for the construction of martyrs' shrines and memorial arches and pagodas is to be planned and handled by local governments at all levels. However, it has been found that many have not been built. Now that more than a year has passed since the victory of the War of Resistance, active efforts should be made to show respect for the loyal and righteous and to maintain the righteous spirit of the nation; (3) Regarding the implementation of national funerals, public funerals, and public cemeteries, the Central Standing Committee and the Supreme National Defense Council have previously resolved to postpone them during the rehabilitation period. Now that the capital has been restored for nearly half a year, it seems that planning and implementation should be considered.</p>

<h3 id="e26">Trade in Northern Vietnamese Ports: French Announce Restriction Regulations; Imports and Exports Must Be Approved for Exchange <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hanoi, 2nd] Concurrently with the implementation of the new Franco-Vietnamese Treaty, the French and Vietnamese authorities announced a regulation stipulating that from November 1st, all goods entering and leaving Northern Vietnamese ports must first be approved for exchange by the French authorities before being allowed to enter or leave. The main points of the regulation are as follows: Imports: Goods shipped from France to Vietnam can be traded freely. Goods shipped from other countries to Vietnam must first be approved and the Vietnamese currency value of the goods must be exchanged at the Foreign Exchange Control Office. It is specifically stipulated that liquid fuels and lubricants are strictly prohibited from being imported. Exports: All goods approved for export must apply for an export permit. Rice, rubber, raw rubber, textiles, refined metals, precious metals, automobiles, automobile materials, machinery and equipment, etc., are strictly prohibited from being exported. All goods approved for export must be exchanged. Foreign exchange must be paid to the French government at the official rate. The principle of Vietnamese import and export trade is balance. Exporters have priority in applying for import transit. Goods transshipped through Northern Vietnamese ports to China should apply for transit at the port management office and can only be transshipped after approval. Domestic Trade in Vietnam: Imported goods are all controlled by the Economic Affairs Bureau's Control Bureau. After approval, they are either directly allocated to users by the government or freely sold by merchants, with separate regulations to be determined. The French authorities also stipulate that Chinese merchants should form chambers of commerce or join French chambers of commerce and can only operate after establishing contact with the French authorities. In order to facilitate the exchange of import and export goods, the French Foreign Exchange Control Office has specifically stipulated that one Vietnamese dollar is equivalent to 500 national dollars, 7 Vietnamese dollars are equivalent to one US dollar, and 1 Vietnamese dollar and 7 jiao 3 fen are equivalent to one Hong Kong dollar. The official exchange rate of the Vietnamese dollar this time, 7 jiao 3 fen is equivalent to one Hong Kong dollar. However, the official exchange rate of the Vietnamese dollar differs greatly from the actual transaction figures in the market. Many of our overseas Chinese merchants have expressed opposition to the measures announced by the French authorities, and whether they can be implemented will depend on the facts.</p>

They were also amazed by the high prices and extravagant lifestyle. They were all concerned about the disaster and, after talking about the news of the famine in some areas, they sighed and said that the Northeast produces more grain, but it cannot be imported into the customs due to transportation issues. The floating capital in Beijing, Shanghai, and other places is rampant, disrupting the market. Wouldn't it be better to use it to revitalize the Northeast? Most of the representatives from the Northeast stayed in a small hotel in the south of the city, discussing national affairs. Their desire for governance was greater than anyone else's.

He should be publicly commended to recognize his loyalty and dedication.</p>
<p>(2) The Executive Yuan submitted a report from the Ministry of Interior stating that Wang Zhaoxiang had made meritorious contributions in resisting the enemy and died from overwork. It was determined that he met the requirements of the Regulations for Commending Loyal Martyrs of the War of Resistance and requested a review and public commendation. Wang Zhaoxiang participated in the revolution at an early age. When the July 7th Incident occurred, he assisted in the War of Resistance, recruiting soldiers and raising funds, enduring extreme hardship and dying from overwork. It is particularly regrettable.

<h3 id="e37">Meeting with Mrs. Cripps: She Says She Is Very Interested in the Yellow River Damming Project; Hopes "China's Sorrow" Will Turn Into "China's Joy" <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>[Our Zhengzhou Dispatch, 2nd] Mrs. Cripps flew to Zhengzhou from Yan'an on the 1st. Counting from Hong Kong, she has traveled 17,000 li on the Chinese mainland. She came to Zhengzhou specifically to see the famous Yellow River and stayed in Zhengzhou for two days, braving the sandstorms, visiting Huayuankou and Zhongmou port. She told reporters that she was very interested in the Yellow River damming project and hoped that the Yellow River, known as "China's Sorrow," would one day become "China's Joy." At Huayuankou, she crossed the Yellow River to the north bank in a Chinese wooden boat. Her companion, Miss Klose, tripped while boarding the boat and slid from the high bank to the river beach, tearing her stockings and scraping her skin. The ancient Yellow River sparkled with silver scales in the sunlight, flowing eastward, silently. Mrs. Cripps was also silent. When she flew from Taiyuan to Yan'an, the Chinese who accompanied her on the trip stopped in Taiyuan and other places. During the trip to Zhengzhou, she stopped at Xinxiang Airport for half an hour, which was the largest airport built by the Japanese army on the banks of the Yellow River.</p>
<p>She is 64 years old, and many people praise her good spirits. It is said that Madame Chiang is very concerned about her and wants her to not have to deal with complicated receptions during her long journey. At 7:30 PM last night, Chairman Liu Maoen sent an invitation to a banquet for her. Li Hongyin, director of the Henan Provincial Department of Social Affairs, hosted the banquet on behalf of Liu Maoen. Everyone ate silently for an hour.</p>
<p>She officially met with reporters at 8:30 AM today. First, she and Mrs. Miller, secretary of the British United Aid to China Fund, gave reporters an overview of the fund's past work, and then let reporters ask questions. Before the reporter's second question was asked, she said that because time was short, she hoped that reporters would ask no more than two questions, for a five-minute conversation. She was serious and dignified, fully demonstrating the British character. She told reporters that she was traveling and learning in China, absorbing impressions, and contacting both the "left" and the "right," because the fund's past work was also like this, not taking a political stance. She was very interested in the agriculture in Yan'an, but in any case, she could not clearly express her views at the moment, because it was most dangerous for foreigners to come to China for only a few days and then express their opinions. Regarding the establishment of a hospital in Yan'an, she expressed gratitude for the understanding of all parties, but as for whether the hospital was well-run, it was impossible to compare it with other places, because the equipment and other conditions could not be measured by the same standard. She continued to tell reporters that one thing she could say was that the Chinese people were currently in a very tragic situation, and she hoped that all parties would have patience and that peace was possible. After saying the opinions of not expressing opinions, she said goodbye to the reporters and prepared to drive to the Zhongmou ferry to see the Yellow River again. The reporter chased after her, wanting to ask a question directly related to Sino-British friendship, but she had already run into her room. Turning around, I saw her daughter, Miss Peggy, sitting in a chair, recording her mother's conversations, performing the duties of a private secretary. She worked diligently all the way, writing a diary for her mother. During the flight, she put the typewriter on her lap, taking advantage of the time to work hard.</p>

<h3 id="e38">The Unignorable Korean Problem <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>The Korean Southern Democratic Association yesterday appealed to the United Nations General Assembly, putting forward three demands: (1) Immediately implement the Cairo Declaration and the Potsdam Declaration to ensure Korea's freedom and independence; (2) The US and Soviet troops should withdraw from Korea immediately; (3) Allow the Korean Provisional Government to join the UN agencies as a member state, to negotiate directly with the Soviet Union to discuss the issue of abolishing the demarcation line between the US and Soviet occupation zones and the withdrawal of Soviet troops.</p>
<p>Korea, in the past, was China's protective screen, now it is China's neighbor, and in the future, it will surely be China's like-minded ally. Therefore, China has always expressed sympathy for Korea's past misfortunes, and is especially concerned about Korea's future destiny. Korea, in its letter to the United Nations General Assembly, stated: "Dividing Korea into two occupation zones is a direct threat to world peace." We not only sympathize with this warning, but also hope that the US and Soviet occupation authorities can put aside their prejudices and have a broad vision, so that they can recognize the correctness of the Korean people's demands.</p>
<p>Korea is the largest peninsula in Asia, protruding into the Sea of Japan and the Yellow Sea, and is located in the middle of China, Japan, and the Soviet Union, forming its important strategic position. In the past forty years, Japanese imperialists have been using Korea as a springboard into the Asian continent and have attempted to use it as a base to attack the Soviet Union. However, after this great war, the aggressors, who continued to wage wars of exhaustion, finally surrendered, and Korea, which had been subjugated for a long time, was freed from the shackles of Japanese warlord rule. Korea has since been liberated, leaping from a colony to an independent and free democratic country, which should not have been a problem at all. However, due to the twists and turns of fate, after the collapse of Japan's dictatorial rule, what followed was the division of Korea by the United States and the Soviet Union. By artificial means, the entire indivisible Korean nation was forcibly divided into North and South, and was ruled by the occupation authorities of the United States and the Soviet Union, resulting in two worlds within one country, which has not yet achieved unification and independence!</p>
<p>Recalling that during the war, the Korean people, under the rule of Japanese warlords, although living in darkness and suffering the bitterness of national subjugation, still felt that the future of Korea would be infinitely bright when they heard the leaders of the United Nations repeatedly issue "war aims" such as the national freedom advocated by the Atlantic Charter. Once Japan was defeated, Korea could be liberated immediately. For example, in August 1941, when the two giants, Roosevelt and Churchill, met somewhere in the Atlantic Ocean, they issued a declaration stating: "The United States and Britain respect the right of all peoples to choose the political form on which their survival depends; in all nations, if this right is deprived, the two countries want to restore their original sovereignty and autonomy." Furthermore, in December 1943, the three giants, Roosevelt, Churchill, and Chiang Kai-shek, issued a declaration after meeting in Cairo, stating: "The purpose of the operations of the three great powers, China, Britain, and the United States, is to deprive Japan of all the islands it has seized or occupied in the Pacific since the beginning of the First World War in 1914, and to deprive Japan of the territories it has stolen from China, such as Manchuria, Taiwan, and the Penghu Islands, which should be returned to China. In addition, Japan will also be expelled from the land it has seized by force or greed. The three great powers, China, Britain, and the United States, in view of the slave treatment suffered by the Korean people, have decided that Korea should be granted freedom and independence in due course." These magnificent international documents gave infinite warmth to the general Korean people living in misery. In their eyes, a bright light of hope was shining. By the time Nazi Germany surrendered unconditionally, victory was in sight, and the Korean people became even more optimistic, especially with the Potsdam Declaration issued by the leaders of the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union, which gave the Korean people greater excitement and impetus. Because the Soviet Union had never expressed its attitude towards Korea clearly before, but in this Potsdam Declaration, it was also solemnly stated: "The terms of the Cairo Declaration shall be implemented." Since the Soviet Union had signed the Potsdam Declaration, it naturally participated in the international guarantee provided for the independence of Korea. In the eyes of the Korean people, how sacred and worthy of celebration the Potsdam Declaration was!</p>
<p>However, after Japan surrendered, when the Korean people were eager to see international promises come to fruition, a sudden twist occurred. Because after the end of the war, the Allied countries, who had fought shoulder to shoulder in the past, seemed to be in a state of mutual suspicion due to conflicts of interest. Setting aside the German and Austrian issues for the time being, in the Far East, the United States and the Soviet Union not only seemed to have differences of opinion on the China issue, but also friction occurred in Korea, causing the sky in the Far East to remain cloudy, with a sense of impending storm. Later, fortunately, US Secretary of State Byrnes took the lead in advocating a compromise with the Soviet Union and personally went to Moscow to hold a meeting of the three foreign ministers with Foreign Minister Molotov and British Foreign Secretary Bevin. In addition to reaching an agreement on the German issue, a compromise was also reached on the Korean issue: (1) Establish a Korean Provisional Government to develop its agriculture, industry, and national culture; (2) The US occupation authorities in southern Korea and the Soviet occupation authorities in northern Korea should form a joint committee; (3) Korea should be placed under the trusteeship of the four powers, China, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, for a period of five years, after which it would be granted independence; (4) The US and Soviet occupation authorities should cooperate effectively and should immediately hold a meeting to discuss various urgent issues and reach solutions.</p>
<p>When the Korean people heard the declaration of the Moscow Three Foreign Ministers' Conference, it was like a bolt from the blue, completely unexpected. Therefore, after being disappointed, the patriotic people launched a mass movement in the country to oppose the five-year trusteeship plan, which was tragic, enthusiastic, and in full swing, and has not stopped to this day. On the US and Soviet sides, although they also know the wishes of the Korean people and their pain under the US-Soviet division, the opinions of the two sides are completely different, and it is really impossible to reach an agreement. Although the US and Soviet occupation authorities have repeatedly held negotiations to discuss the political and economic merger of the two occupation zones, so that there would no longer be two worlds in Korea, the negotiations reached the brink of collapse on May 6 this year and could not continue. No negotiations have resumed since then.</p>
<p>The wishes of the Korean people are very clear and simple: in a word, they oppose the five-year trusteeship plan and demand the immediate establishment of a provisional government to realize the Korean people's desire for self-governance. The Soviet Union, on the other hand, insists on the resolution of the Moscow Three Foreign Ministers' Conference, placing Korea under the trusteeship of the four powers for five years before granting it independence; at the same time, it has erected a thick iron curtain in the Soviet occupation zone of northern Korea, not allowing outsiders to know the actual situation in northern Korea, and not allowing any interaction between the US and Soviet occupation zones. The Soviet Union's actions have virtually turned Korea into two worlds, and the Korean people feel even more the pain of the country being dismembered, and they are more urgently demanding national independence and freedom. As for the US occupation zone, General Hodge's control is indeed very clever and can win the support of the Korean people. However, his sole goal in controlling southern Korea is to prevent the southward invasion of Soviet forces into southern Korea, so there has been no way to reach a compromise with the Soviet Union to "restore Korea to unity."</p>
<p>In short, today's Korea has become a stage for the struggle of the United States and the Soviet Union. From the perspective of the Korean people, they not only feel increasingly hopeless about the prospect of independence, but also feel that their own position is extremely dangerous. If the policies adopted by the United States and the Soviet Union in Korea are not revised, the mutual suspicion between the two sides will inevitably intensify, and an unforeseen disaster may even come one day. Therefore, the Korean Southern Democratic Association said: "Dividing Korea into two occupation zones is a direct threat to world peace." We completely sympathize with this, and we hope that the United Nations General Assembly by Lake Success will not turn a deaf ear to the voices of the Korean people. At the same time, the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference is being held in New York today, and this issue should also be discussed, because how Korea is arranged should really not be ignored.</p>

<p>[Zhenjiang News] The Jiangnan Seawall in Jiangsu Province starts from the Jin Si Niang Bridge on the border of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, passes through Jinshan, Songjiang, Fengxian, Nanhui, Chuansha, Baoshan, Taicang, Changshu, and ends at Jiangyin, with a total length of more than 300 kilometers. It is located in the estuary of the river and the sea, where the tides are surging, so seawalls are built to defend against them. Over the past eight years, the seawall has collapsed, especially in the four counties of Taicang, Songjiang, Changshu and Baoshan, where the situation is particularly dangerous. The piles and stones have been completely destroyed, and more than 4,000 meters of the seawall have collapsed, and dozens of large and small soil seawalls have collapsed. The Jiangsu-Ningbo Branch of the Executive Yuan, the Water Conservancy Committee, and the Jiangsu Provincial Government jointly repaired the seawall to protect the coastal farmland and the lives and property of the people, using work as compensation. According to reporters, since the start of construction in March this year to the end of September, the first phase of the project has been completed. The actual work of piles and stones in the four counties of Changshu, Taicang, Baoshan and Songjiang is 45,826 man-days, 1,605 tons of flour and 800 tons of rice were distributed, 7,500 cubic meters of earthwork and 11,175 cubic meters of stonework were completed. In addition, the soil seawall project in the nine counties of Chengjiang, Changshu, Taicang, Baoshan, Nanchuan, Fengxian, Songjiang, and Jinshan actually did 106,839 man-days, and 800 tons of flour and 150 tons of rice were distributed. 124,806.53 cubic meters of earthwork and 11,180.34 cubic meters of stone were thrown. It is reported that Zheng Tonghe, Director of the Jiangsu-Ningbo Branch of the Executive Yuan, Shen Baixian, Deputy Chairman of the Water Conservancy Committee, Dong Zanyao, Director of the Construction Department, and Mr. Kang Yi of the United Relief Association, jointly went to inspect the completed project on the 3rd of this month, and to guide the continuation of the second phase of the project, the piles and stones of the Changshu, Taicang, Baoshan and Songjiang sections of the seawall, which are proceeding rapidly according to plan. It is said that the second phase of the project requires up to 2,200 tons of flour.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper Wuxi News] The new recruits from the three counties of Wuxi, Chengjiang and Yixing in the Wuxi Military Region have been ordered by the county magistrates of each county to draw lots in various townships and towns respectively, and have successively completed the process and sent them to the Huishan New Recruits Training Center for enlistment training. In this county, 422 able-bodied young men of the right age have been sent to the center. As many as 231 people failed the inspection, and only 191 people passed. New recruits from Jiangyin and Yixing counties have also been sent to the center in recent days, and the situation is very enthusiastic. This time, the center is particularly strict with physical examinations for new recruits, preferring to have too few rather than too many, in order to establish a modern national defense army.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Jiangyin News] This county was ordered to conscript 580 new recruits. County Magistrate Fang actively ordered each district and town to draw lots to determine the recruits. A total of 293 people passed the inspection. The Wuxi Military Region has sent personnel to Chengjiang to check and accept them. At 12:00 noon today (the 2nd), they were gathered in the city stadium and reorganized into two companies. All sectors held a consolation meeting, and each new recruit was given consolation goods worth 5,000 yuan. A variety show was held in the county government auditorium. At 2:00 PM, they took cars to Wuxi to enter the camp. After the first batch of new recruits went to Wuxi, various agencies will organize an investigation team to go to various townships to investigate whether there are any corrupt practices. If any occur, they will be reported to the military region for handling. As for the 168 unqualified young men, the military section has strictly ordered each township to transfer qualified young men to supplement the number, so as to meet the public orders in a short period of time.</p>

<h3 id="e45">Prices Rise, Rice Prices Fall: Labor-Management Disputes in Suzhou <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Suzhou News] The workers in various industries in this county once had labor-management disputes because the price of rice rose endlessly and wages could not keep up. After mediation by the relevant authorities, it was finally agreed to pay wages based on rice, and both labor and management were able to see mutual benefits. However, in recent months, the price of rice has fallen and the price of goods has risen, and the wages of the workers have suddenly been shortened, and it has become difficult to meet their living needs, so they have once again proposed to increase wages. The summary is as follows: (1) The wages of shoe-making workers are calculated per pair. Making a pair of shoes can earn 1.9 to 3.5 liters of rice. Labor feels that the price of rice has fallen and other commodity prices have risen. It is requested that the employer increase wages based on the proportion of shoe-making workers, but the employer agrees. Therefore, a general strike was launched on the 1st, and the county's social department is currently mediating. (2) Construction workers feel that the value of each worker's wages in Shanghai is more than 10,000 yuan, and Wuxi also has 6,400 yuan, while this county only has more than 3,000 yuan, so they have proposed a price increase request to the employer. The employer said that when the price was adjusted last time, it was agreed that it could only be changed after six months, but only one month has passed, and it is difficult to break the contract. Therefore, the two sides are deadlocked and have not been resolved so far. (3) The tofu workers recently asked the employer to calculate their wages based on 60,000 yuan per stone of rice to maintain their livelihood. The employer said that it has been agreed that since the price of rice has fallen, it cannot be converted according to this standard. The two sides are currently waiting for mediation.</p>

It was resolved that the county government, the county Party headquarters, and the Provisional Council would launch the construction. (2) When Chairman Chiang was looking at the scenery on Longtouzhu, he believed that there were too few trees in Wuxi and that more afforestation movements should be carried out. It was decided to expand the afforestation of Zhongzheng Forest and build Jieshou Hall. (3) To solicit 10,000 outstanding Party and Corps members as a birthday celebration. All were passed for handling.</p>
<h3 id="e50">The Winter Cultivation of Some Farmland in Northern Jiangsu Has Been Delayed: The Spring Famine Next Year Is Worrying, Relying Only on Stored Grain: Observations Released by Inspection Teams from Central Agencies <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Suzhou Electric, 3rd] A group of 12 people from the inspection team of central agencies set off from Nanjing on October 2 and traveled to more than 30 counties north and south of the Yangtze River, arriving in Suzhou yesterday. Our reporter went to visit after hearing the news. When asked about the impressions of this trip, they told us that the inspection task was centered on the newly recovered areas in northern Jiangsu. The general impression was that it was unbearable to see. The entire rural area of northern Jiangsu was either a natural disaster or a man-made disaster. Most farmers are now eating sweet potato porridge every day. Although it is time to plant wheat, some farmland is barren and no one is cultivating it. There are two reasons for this: (1) The coastal counties cannot be cultivated due to flooding; (2) When the communists controlled the area, they distributed land rights in a disorganized manner. After the recovery, some landowners did not dare to continue cultivating, while most of the original owners fled and did not return. Therefore, at present, they are only relying on a small amount of stored grain to maintain themselves. It is expected that the spring famine next year will be severe and needs to be saved urgently. It is learned that the team has come to Suzhou to sort out the report and does not plan to set out for inspection again. They will return to Nanjing in the next few days.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper Jinhua News] The Jinhua Chamber of Commerce believes that the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway and other lines are being actively repaired, and it is expected that the transportation in the southeast and southwest will be smooth soon. At the time when Taiwan returns to the motherland's territory, in order to consolidate national defense, it is urgent to build the Jin-Ou Railway to connect with the mainland and achieve the effect of control. Moreover, the sugar production in Taiwan is very abundant, and the seafood in Yongjia is also abundant, and it is particularly necessary to open up more transportation routes to facilitate domestic sales. The leakage of imports in Shejin, the alum in Pingyang, and the fluorine stone in Wuyi are all related to increasing agricultural production and manufacturing military supplies. If this road is completed, its benefits to both national defense and economy will be far-reaching. It is heard that Cheng and others have drafted a proposal and submitted it to the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce for discussion.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper Bengbu News] In the past two months, under the shadow of the commercial recession, the market in this area has become increasingly depressed. Lively streets have been holding closing sales, and the words "Liquidation at 60% off" reflect the shopkeepers' anxiety to sell off their goods. Those who have closed down are following one after another, and the empty houses after the announcement of closure are also unattended. Those who depend on renting houses for a living are complaining endlessly. According to the survey of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the businesses that closed down in September and October are as follows: September: grain stores, salt and grain stores, oil and grain stores, leather and oil stores, sugar and paper stores, wood industry, silk and cloth stores, sauce gardens, Western medicine stores, and sock factories, one each; department stores, two; grocery stores, two; gauze stores, two; earth cloth stores, eight; cloth stores, four; Suzhou bag stores, two; leather factories, three; for a total of 33. October: grain stores, salt and grain stores, cotton cloth stores, tobacco industry, grocery stores, cloth stores, department stores, one each; transportation, two; leather factories, eight; for a total of 17. A total of 50 businesses closed down in the two months, with the earth cloth stores and leather shops accounting for the largest number, and their operations were also the most tragic. After entering winter, the market is even more deserted, and it is expected that more businesses in various industries will continue to close down in the future.</p>

<p>Provincial Government's Redistribution Plan Difficult to Implement</p>
<p>[Our Hangzhou Dispatch, 3rd] The salaries of public school teachers in various counties of Zhejiang are meager, many still below 30,000, making it impossible to make ends meet. It is often heard of teachers sending their children off to work at a young age. The provincial government intends to redistribute funds from wealthier counties to poorer ones, but this requires the approval of the Provincial Assembly. However, the resident assembly members still have differing opinions on this matter. The Hangzhou city assembly members have already submitted a request to the provincial government to be exempted from assisting other counties due to their own financial difficulties, and it is feared that the Ningbo, Shaoxing, Jiaxing, and Huzhou regions will also be unable to provide assistance.</p>

<p>[Our Hangzhou Dispatch] Zhao Yanxiu, a rickshaw puller assemblyman in Hangzhou, was pulling an empty rickshaw around 6 a.m. on the 1st when he passed through Guanxiangkou to Sanyuanfang. There, traffic officer Fu Xiulan, claiming to be acting on police orders, stopped him, saying that empty rickshaws were not allowed to pass through. Fu then confiscated the rickshaw seat cushion. Zhao questioned Fu's actions and asked to see the police order, leading to a conflict. Fu took Zhao to the Zhongzheng Street police station. The patrol officer Zhang Guowei was away, so police officers Gong Jian and three others detained him for obstructing traffic, citing violation of police regulations. Zhao then produced a name card bearing the titles "Hangzhou City Assemblyman, Zhejiang Branch Member of the Chinese Labor Association, Executive Director of the Hangzhou General Labor Union, Standing Director of the Hangzhou Rickshaw Pullers Union" and questioned the police officers for the reason. The police officers, thinking he was impersonating someone, forcibly dragged him into the detention cell. Zhao resisted, and Gong and others slapped Zhao's face, causing his left eye to swell and bruise. After the City Assembly learned of this, they sent someone to the police station to negotiate and expressed their condolences to Zhao. At the same time, they located officer Zhang. By this time, Zhao, feeling that the police officers had abused their power and that his face had been assaulted and injured, refused to be released. It was not until around 12 p.m., when the Deputy Bureau Chief of the Second Precinct of the Police Bureau, Ren Shuduo, personally punished the two police officers with confinement and expressed deep remorse, that Zhao left the station. After hearing the news, Shen Pu, the director of the Municipal Police Bureau, personally went to Zhao's residence and the City Assembly at 2 p.m. to apologize, stating that he would be responsible for investigating the personnel involved. However, Zhao, feeling that the police officers had publicly insulted a city assemblyman, infringed on his personal freedom, and caused bodily harm, filed a legal complaint.</p>

<p>Reason for Collecting Supplementary Fare at Xujiahui Station</p>
<p>Reply to a Passenger: Regarding your previous letter pointing out the matter of collecting supplementary fare for fourth-class passengers at Xujiahui Station, the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway Administration has replied stating: "It has been found that a considerable number of fourth-class passengers on the 68th train disembark at Xujiahui Station every day and are charged a supplementary fare. There are regulations specifying which stations on this line sell fourth-class tickets and which do not. Xujiahui Station is a station that does not sell fourth-class tickets. If passengers purchase fourth-class tickets to Shanghai West but disembark at Xujiahui Station, it is indeed not in accordance with the regulations. Xujiahui Station charges each passenger 300 yuan as a supplementary fare, which is in accordance with the regulations and is not inappropriate. A receipt numbered 77173 was issued at the time. However, according to the regulations, this receipt must be sent along with the passenger ticket to the Accounting Department of this line for review, so it must be taken back immediately after it is issued and cannot be given to the passenger to keep, causing a misunderstanding. It has also been found that the stationmaster personally supervises and railway staff members are present to observe whenever the station collects supplementary passenger tickets upon arrival of each train. In order to clarify the facts, Xujiahui Station was specially ordered to report in detail the situation of collecting supplementary fares every day from October 1st to 10th, which has been reviewed and found to be accurate," etc., and this is hereby replied.</p>

<p>[Agence France-Presse, New York, 3rd] The four foreign ministers are scheduled to meet at 4 p.m. on the 4th in the pale green living room on the 37th floor of the Waldorf Astoria Hotel here, sitting around an oval table to decide the final peace terms for Germany's five satellite states. The hotel is world-renowned, and its meeting rooms are particularly opulent. The foreign ministers of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union will attend in person. French President and Foreign Minister Bidault, due to the upcoming general election in the country, is unable to attend and has specially appointed Deputy Foreign Minister Couve de Murville as his representative. According to well-informed sources, the request of Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg for the four foreign ministers to allow them to attend the discussion on the German issue will be considered. If these countries are invited, then Germany's eastern neighbors, especially Poland and Czechoslovakia, will also have to attend. It is heard that the exploration of the German issue is under consideration, especially by Secretary of State Byrnes. Byrnes seems to insist that this issue needs to be resolved quickly, especially the issue of Germany's borders, at least regarding the western border of that country.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] London, 3rd Broadcast: British Foreign Secretary Bevin and French Deputy Foreign Minister Couve de Murville arrived in New York today on the mail ship "Aquitania." On the ship, Bevin told reporters that he was neither pessimistic nor optimistic about the future of the United Nations organization. Bevin hoped that the United Nations could develop according to its original purpose, but believed that the formation of a world organization constitution would take a long time, just as the formation of the constitutions of the United States and the United Kingdom required a long time. He said, "We cannot expect the United Nations to proceed smoothly in its first year of life; difficulties are inevitable. If we do not move forward bravely, deal with all the problems, and try to understand various viewpoints, we will not be able to solve the current problems. Our main difficulty at present is that on the one hand, we must sign peace treaties, and on the other hand, we must establish the United Nations; the contradictions and conflicts between them make the problem more complicated. Therefore, we can only solve the problem step by step, and cannot solve all the problems at the same time. We cannot solve all the problems of mankind within one year; what is most needed at present is caution, patience, and tolerance." Couve de Murville said: "It is difficult to predict how the four foreign ministers' meeting will turn out. All the issues discussed in the New York meeting have been discussed in the Paris Peace Conference. Some of them were passed by a unanimous majority, others by a simple majority or a two-thirds majority, so we need to discuss again all the proposals that have not been unanimously decided."</p>

<p>[Our Dispatch] San Francisco, 3rd Broadcast: U.S. Secretary of the Army Patterson and Secretary of the Navy Forrest today met with Secretary of State Byrnes to urge President Truman to clearly express his views on the bases on the Pacific Islands seized from Japan, so as to avoid disputes between the State Department and the military, and to clarify the U.S. policy before the United Nations General Assembly discusses the trusteeship issue. The disagreement between the Army, Navy, and State Department began in 1944, when the military requested that the islands be incorporated into the United States. The late President Roosevelt rejected this and accepted the principle of trusteeship as a solution. It is expected that President Truman will continue to implement this policy and adopt the same position as the State Department.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Lake Success, 2nd] According to today's information, the Soviet Union is preparing to propose authorizing one of the five powers to veto the United Nations Trusteeship Draft Convention. This proposal will be submitted to the UN Trusteeship Committee, which will inevitably cause a great reaction in the committee. The U.S. delegation is said to firmly oppose this proposal by the Soviet Union on the grounds that the Soviet Union has too much say over the Pacific Islands seized by the U.S. military from Japan. According to reliable sources, the Soviet representative intends to argue that the five powers of the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, and France all have "direct relations" to the submission of the Trusteeship Draft Convention. According to the provisions of the United Nations Charter, every draft convention must be approved by the countries directly related to the trust territory, otherwise it cannot be implemented. Therefore, if the Soviet proposal is adopted, any one of the five powers may veto any trusteeship proposal.</p>

<p>[Reuters, New York, Flushing, 2nd] When asked for his opinion on the United States' suggestion to locate the permanent headquarters of the United Nations in New York or San Francisco, Soviet representative Vyshinsky asked, "Aren't New York and San Francisco very far from the Soviet Union?" It is generally believed that Vyshinsky's words may be an indication that the Soviet Union will request a re-examination of this entire issue at the General Assembly in order to overturn the decision of the London UN Conference to establish the permanent headquarters of the United Nations in the United States.</p>

At the same time, Ms. Eun sent a telegram to UN Secretary-General Lie, urging Chairman Lie to take swift action in view of the deteriorating situation in North Korea. It is understood that Ms. Eun's recent appeal to Lie was based on a telegram sent by Syngman Rhee, which mentioned the crisis situation in Korea, so immediate action was necessary. The telegram, which was delivered today, briefly stated that Koreans in North Korea are currently being forced into the Soviet army.</p>

As a result of the vote, the recommendation of the Social and Economic Council was upheld, and Spain was refused participation in this matter, which will be directly submitted to the General Assembly for debate.</p>

<p>[Reuters, New York, Lake Success, 3rd] The Egyptian delegation today submitted a resolution to the UN General Assembly, requesting immediate and vigorous steps to end policies of discrimination and exclusion against religions and races. The resolution stated that after investigation in Central European countries, it was found that after the victory of democratic forces, religious minorities still suffered from cruel exclusion and discrimination, and therefore could not enjoy equal treatment with other citizens, and their situation was very difficult. Such policies of exclusion and discrimination completely disregard the basic principles of humanity and are contrary to the purposes of the United Nations.

<p>Japanese People Flock to Meiji Shrine to Pay Respects</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Tokyo, 3rd] Japanese Emperor Hirohito today issued an edict promulgating the new constitution, which reads: "This constitution is a complete revision of the Imperial Constitution. It seeks the foundation for national revival, stipulates that the people may freely express their will, declares that Japan automatically renounces war, and hopes for the establishment of permanent peace. We hope that the people will devote their full efforts to implement this constitution and build a civilized country." The edict was read to the members of the House of Representatives and the House of Peers. The House of Peers ceased to exist upon the promulgation of the constitution. Prime Minister Yoshida said in his reply that he was determined to do his best to comply with the Emperor's will, and the President of the House of Peers, Tokugawa, also assured that they would unite and promote the constitution.</p>
<p>[Remodeling Corporation, Tokyo, 3rd] Although the new Japanese constitution was promulgated this morning, many Japanese people still feel reluctant to part with the old "Imperial Constitution," especially the upper classes. Tokyo University President Nanbara said in a speech at the university this morning: "Although the national system has been changed, the foundation of the new emperor system has been established here. When we bid farewell to the Meiji Constitution, which we once called the eternal and unchangeable Grand Canon, we think of the glorious Meiji era and do not forget that the new constitution was drafted under the restrictions of the fate of defeat." These words frankly express the mood of the Japanese people. Today happens to be Meiji Day, and the Meiji Shrine, which has been deserted for a long time after the war, is suddenly lively, and worshipers flock to it. Members of the imperial family, as well as Prime Minister Yoshida and others, are among them, and the former King of Korea, Lee Eun, also went to pay his respects.</p>

<p>— Our Newspaper Archives</p>
<p>This issue has a long history, so let's start by recounting its origins. The term "trusteeship" first appeared in Roman law, but its large-scale implementation in the modern sense began after World War I. At that time, Germany and Turkey were defeated, and the victorious nations hesitated about how to handle some of the colonies they left behind. Should they be granted independence? These colonies did not meet the required standards in terms of politics, economy, and culture. If they were rashly granted autonomy, the result might make them targets for strong neighbors, causing endless future troubles. After careful consideration, the Versailles Peace Conference decided to treat these colonies as "mandated territories," entrusting them to a suitable power for trusteeship through the League of Nations, like a nanny taking care of an infant. The mandated territories system had goals and strategies. The countries assuming trusteeship had to make every effort to help these colonies become independent and autonomous in all aspects and report the progress to the League of Nations. Once the colony was capable of independence and autonomy, and the infant had grown up, the country assuming trusteeship could declare the mission accomplished and grant it independence. Under this system, the countries assuming the mandates were Britain, France, Australia, the Union of South Africa, New Zealand, Belgium, and Japan. Some of the mandated territories were truly able to become independent and autonomous. For example, Iraq formally declared independence in 1932. However, most of the colonies were often treated as private property by the countries assuming trusteeship, seized and held onto.</p>
<p>With the end of the Second World War and the defeat of the Axis powers, how to resolve the issue of the colonies and former mandated territories they left behind naturally became a difficult problem again. Naturally, everyone thought of the "trusteeship" method, which was similar to the mandate system.</p>
<p>The international trusteeship system is stipulated in Chapters XI, XII, and XIII of the United Nations Charter. When these sections were discussed at the San Francisco Conference, the experts and representatives truly racked their brains, arguing over every single word, often debating for weeks. This also shows how important this matter was!</p>
<p>At the Dumbarton Oaks Conference in August 1944, the United States had intended to propose a plan for an international trusteeship system, but because the Soviet Union had not yet declared war on Japan, discussing some of the trusteeship issues in the Pacific at this time would certainly cause trouble in the future. Therefore, the issue was not raised at all during the conference. It was not until the Yalta Conference of the Big Three in February of the following year that the trusteeship issue was formally discussed.</p>
<p>However, the Yalta Conference did not discuss practical issues but only some principles, roughly as follows: (1) The three powers should propose a trusteeship plan with unanimous agreement at the San Francisco Conference in May; (2) Trusteeship should include existing mandated territories, post-war enemy colonies, and territories voluntarily submitted for trusteeship by other countries; (3) The detailed distribution of trust territories would not be discussed at the San Francisco Conference for the time being. According to this last point, it was naturally still for the sake of the base issue in the Pacific because the Soviet Union had not yet declared war on Japan, making it inconvenient to discuss.</p>
<p>At the San Francisco Conference, after expending a great deal of effort, the articles of the international trusteeship system were finally passed in the Charter. In the draft proposed by the United States, some special "strategic zones" were delineated for the bases in the Pacific. Although this point was ultimately passed, it was strongly opposed by the Soviet representatives during the discussion. On June 26, 1945, the United Nations Charter was finally signed and established. The plan for the international trusteeship system was included in the Charter.</p>

<p>To celebrate Chairman Chiang's 60th birthday, people from all walks of life in the Philippine overseas Chinese community organized a "Philippine Overseas Chinese Delegation to Nanjing to Celebrate His Birthday." They returned to the country some days ago and paid respects to the Chairman to wish him longevity. Taking advantage of this rare opportunity to establish contact with business people in the country and to investigate the commercial situation in coastal provinces and cities, and the possibility of developing trade between China and the Philippines, they formed a separate business delegation to investigate the provinces of Taiwan, Guangdong, and Fujian. The delegation was headed by Xue Fensi, the deputy head of the birthday celebration delegation, and Shi Xing, the deputy head, leading delegation members Yang Shibing, Liu Qingping, and others, a total of sixteen people. They flew from Nanjing to Shanghai at 10:00 yesterday morning and stayed at the Jinmen Hotel.

<h3 id="e89">"Inner Wisdom and Outer Simplicity" Viewing Sun Qingyang's Painting Exhibition <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] The Shanghai Art Association recently held Sun Qingyang's painting exhibition at the Xingwu Restaurant on the fourth floor of the Cishu Building on Nanjing East Road. According to Sun Fu Yuan, Sun's works are "inner wisdom and outer simplicity, with a level of skill that is rarely seen in the country in recent times. With a passionate heart and powerful brush, he creates a true portrayal of the times and conveys the common feelings of mankind."</p>
<p>Sun's exhibited works include four categories: Chinese painting, watercolor painting, sketching, and oil painting. Sun's Chinese paintings, whether figures or landscapes, still retain the traditional style in brushwork, but in terms of rendering, the volume is adjusted to conform to three-dimensional perspective. Sun's horses are highly praised. The horses in ordinary Chinese paintings are either too short in body or too long in legs. Sun's horses are simple and archaic in brushwork, while the proportions conform to anatomy, which should be attributed to his foundation in Western painting. The "South China East Mountain" and "Jade Tiger Pulling Silk to Draw Well" in this exhibition are rare good paintings.</p>
<p>Watercolor painting is extremely difficult because it is difficult to correct a bad stroke. Sun's watercolor paintings include landscapes, and more works that are sensitive to the times. The Thousand Character Classic watercolor painting is one example. It uses the sentences of the Thousand Character Classic, one by one, to give new explanations, making them closely related to the real social situation, and then forms a series of pictures to express various social phenomena. In addition, "New Stories in Painting" also uses ancient people and ancient events, such as Zhuo Wenjun, Princess Shouyang, and the Battle of Gaixia, to express a new consciousness.</p>
<p>In general, Sun Qingyang's works have the beauty of being profound yet easy to understand. Art masters will certainly recognize them as extraordinary, and ordinary people can also appreciate them.</p>

<p>Since its establishment, the Chinese Victory Pigeon Association has actively developed its affairs, guiding its members to study and improve pigeon breeds and train pigeons for long-distance flights. During the first visit of the chairman to Shanghai and the recent celebration of his 60th birthday, the association released peace pigeons at the Racecourse and the Ningbo Fellow Association, showing their congratulations. The pigeons soared into the sky, creating a spectacular sight. This year, the juvenile pigeon race between Shanghai and Xixi, a distance of 128 kilometers, was held on Double Ten Day. The pigeon of member Zhang Yongqing flew back in 2 hours and 10 minutes, winning the championship, which was truly commendable. It is now learned that in order to continue to strengthen the long-distance transmission efficiency of homing pigeons, the association has decided to continue to hold the second race on the Nanjing-Shanghai line. Friendship races will be held in Changzhou on the 10th of this month and in Danyang on the 24th, and then the Cup race will be officially held in Nanjing, the endpoint of the Nanjing-Shanghai line, on the 8th of next month. The entire route is more than 290 kilometers long. Zhu Yongnian and Chen Feipeng will still be responsible for the release. The homing pigeons participating in the competition are limited to young pigeons hatched this year.</p>

<p>In order to coordinate the city's water and land transportation and to cooperate with the overall plan of the Greater Shanghai urban plan, the Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities is actively preparing for the Municipal Ferry Company, and has merged the original Public Bus Committee and Tramway Preparation Office to form the Shanghai Transportation Company Preparatory Committee, which is dedicated to coordinating, planning, and organizing the Shanghai land transportation network. It is learned that the initial plan of the Transportation Company is to try to open up public buses in the urban and suburban areas as much as possible within March, so as to connect with the French public buses and complete the transportation network of public buses in the city. The second step of the work plan has not yet been determined, but it mainly involves reorganizing road rights and the rights of tramways and public buses to operate. It is verified that although the British public bus company still has years remaining on its operating rights, the company's vehicles have been completely damaged and have not yet been restored. The Bureau of Public Utilities has now set a deadline for it to resume operations by the end of this month, otherwise its operating rights will be taken over by the city. As for the British tram company's operating rights, they will expire on October 9 next year. Recently, the Municipal Council suggested that it be taken over by the city, and the Municipal Government also planned to buy all the assets of the company. As for the French tram company and public bus company's operating rights, they still have several years remaining. The Bureau is carefully considering whether to take back the operating rights in advance.</p>
<p>Since the implementation of traffic improvements in the central area of the city on September 9 of this year, the number of traffic accidents during the specified time has gradually decreased. It is learned that the Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities, in view of the fact that the number of vehicles heading west on Nanjing Road and Beijing Road is twice as crowded after the various agencies and offices close at around 5:00 PM, is now preparing to improve the situation again in order to solve the traffic difficulties on these two roads. It is said that the above issue will be submitted to the recent traffic conference for discussion.</p>

Young and old gathered together, talking and laughing. During the party, Sun Chuntai's wife told the story of her exile, and sculptor Liu Kaiqu talked about the upper, middle, and lower classes, humbly claiming that he was a lower-class person who only knew how to use his hands and didn't know how to use his mouth. His words were humorous and thought-provoking. Afterwards, there were harmonica solos, guessing games, and other entertainment.</p>
<p>The Star Six Literary Tea House held its third tea party at Xiangxue Garden on the afternoon of the day before yesterday, with Zhao Qingge, Shen Hui, Jing Youlin, Ma Gongyu, Qian Huafo, Xu Shiqi, Hua Lin, Wang Jinshan, and others, a total of more than 40 people, attending.

<p>[Our Newspaper News] At around 11:00 AM yesterday, a bloody case of a divorced husband stabbing his ex-wife occurred inside No. 134 Taoyuanfang, Tiantong Road, Hongkou. Fortunately, the neighbors discovered it and caught the murderer on the spot and sent him to the Hongkou Police Station. The injured person was rushed to the Kung Chi Hospital for treatment. There were three wounds, in front of the chest and on the left and right shoulders on the back. At that time, she was in a coma and unconscious due to excessive bleeding. She was given first aid and was out of danger by the evening. The woman's name is Ren Aiyu, 20 years old, from Guangdong. Two years ago, she met He Youshui (38 years old), a clockmaker from the same hometown, and they became a couple out of friendship. They lived together at No. 4 Shaoxingli, Shanxi North Road. Recently, their relationship broke down, so they agreed to an unconditional divorce on September 2. Aiyu also moved to No. 134 Taoyuanfang, Tiantong Road. At 11:00 AM yesterday morning, He suddenly went to the woman's place for something. The two sides started arguing. He became angry for a moment and found a sharp knife in the room, stabbing the woman fiercely. The woman was caught off guard and was stabbed in the chest and on the left and right shoulders on the back. Blood splattered everywhere, and she screamed for help. The neighbors heard the sound and went to investigate. At that time, the murderer was trying to escape through the door and was caught. According to He's confession at the police station, it was because the woman was entangled with him and he was greatly stimulated. He deeply regretted it afterwards. The details are still under investigation at the police station.</p>

<h3 id="e101">A Fox Fur Coat Costs Millions; Where Can Anyone Find the Extra Money for a New One? Furriers' Business Is Depressed <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper] From the chorus of complaints of furriers, one can glimpse the ailing state of this outwardly glamorous city, with a cancerous tumor of economic depression festering deep in its heart!</p>
<p>Originally, the cold weather should be the time to buy winter furs. However, transactions at the counters of various fur shops are as deserted as graveyards. It is said that the daily retail turnover of several major furriers at the Canidrome is no more than two to three million yuan. Have the city's sons and daughters forgotten to be fashionable? It doesn't seem so!</p>
<p>Let's hear the furriers speak frankly. They say: the long, hot weather this year is an "immediate cause." The distant cause is that most industries in the market this year are depressed. The speculative businesses that once dominated the scene have also disappeared one by one. Since there is no industry making a fortune, where will the customers come from?</p>
<p>Furthermore, the fur business itself requires heavy capital, and the threat of high-interest loans is a constant concern. The time available for business each year is only from October to March on the lunar calendar. The profit and loss of the entire year depends on this one season. According to their years of statistics, people who want to buy new furs usually prepare before the Lunar New Year. Once the Lunar New Year is over, no matter how cold the spring weather, there will be few inquiries about new furs! In their business eyes, the depressed market this year seems to foreshadow a bleak season for them!</p>
<p>Types and Origins of Furs</p>
<p>The reporter was unwilling to let the conversation sink further into gloom, so he steered it towards the issue of the furs themselves. The furriers then enumerated the types and origins of the furs as if counting their treasures. To mention the more prominent ones, the southern regions have tiger, otter, spotted cat, and badger skins from Yunnan; and white deer from Guizhou and Zhejiang. The northern regions have sheep and fox skins from Gansu, Xinjiang, Mongolia, and Chahar. The Northeast is particularly a hotbed for the production of furs. It is said that it produces skins of squirrel, yellow weasel, raccoon, fox, sable, and other species.</p>
<p>Fur coats have a history full of vicissitudes in the evolution of Shanghai fashion. In the past, during the era of autocratic emperors, fur coats were considered the product of the nobility. Wearing furs was also hierarchical. Certain people were only allowed to wear certain types of fur, and if they exceeded the limit, not only would the government not allow it, but they would also be ridiculed among their peers. There was even a saying at the time: "First-rank officials wear black fox, second-rank wear sable, third and fourth-rank wear Japanese knife (otter)." How long ago was it that the tide of democracy swept away all the remnants of this era? Fur coats have been "popularized" to those with general economic means. Then, as Western trends gradually spread eastward, gentlemen seemed even more sensitive than ladies. Over the past decade, Western suits have become prevalent. Gentlemen who are used to wearing Western suits mostly abandoned heavy fur coats for winter, opting for thick woolen overcoats. Even those who wear traditional Chinese robes prefer light and warm silk-cotton robes, topped with a worsted wool coat. This has invisibly reduced the need for fur coats. The blow suffered by the fur industry as a result has been severe enough.</p>
<p>Relying Entirely on the Ladies</p>
<p>However, what is lost in the east is gained in the west. Fortunately, in the past four or five years, the city's ladies have not been willing to lag behind. They have also adopted European styles in their clothing, like the gentlemen. In this era, a woman wearing a Western suit and trousers on the street will certainly not be seen as a monster. Therefore, overcoats for keeping warm also followed suit. I remember that women's overcoats used to be mostly made of woolen fabric or even serge. Even if they made a fur coat, the fur side was mostly used as the lining. However, fashionable European and American women prefer to have the fur side facing outwards. As a result, this type of fur coat has become popular starting four or five years ago and has reached its peak in the last two years! Rich women ask their husbands, or the men who are passionately pursuing them, to order one from a fashion store. Daughters from moderately wealthy families, even if they can't ask someone to make one for them, will secretly ask their parents, digging out an old fur coat from their father's wardrobe and handing it over to the tailors in the fashion store for a "magical revival." As long as the fur is turned to the outside, isn't it also a luxurious and elegant fur coat? This fierce determination to be beautiful among fashionable ladies has ultimately supported the currently depressed fur industry. No wonder the furriers smile broadly and treat the ladies who come to the counter to buy fur coats with utmost care.</p>
<p>According to the furriers, the most popular types of fur coats in Shanghai (meaning the best-selling ones) are raccoon, cat, white deer, and sheepskin. The biggest use for these types of fur is to make reversible fur-lined women's coats. Other types of fur, such as black fox, white fox, gray back, leopard skin, and sable, are also used to make women's coats, but their sales volume is limited.</p>
<p>Cat Skin Prices Have Increased the Most</p>
<p>When talking about the market price of various goods, the furriers couldn't help but start calculating on their abacuses. It is said that the average price of various furs has increased by four to five thousand times compared to before the war. If we take a single example, the increase in prices of noble furs such as black fox and white fox is the smallest, only a thousand times compared to before the war. However, unexpectedly, the increase in the price of cat skin, which used to be the cheapest fur, is the highest, estimated to be ten thousand times. The reporter couldn't help but doubt the truth of this statement. However, the furriers explained it well: cat skins are mostly taken from domestic cats. In recent years, labor costs have greatly increased. From skinning, washing, tanning, to piecing together a fur coat, it is unknown how much labor costs are required. Furthermore, in recent years, war has raged everywhere, and people are starving. People can't even feed themselves, so who has the extra energy to raise cats? With fewer cats, there are also fewer cat skins, and the price of fur has naturally increased along with it. This statement contains so much bitterness.</p>
<p>Let me tell you, fashionable gentlemen and ladies! The current price of furs is as follows: for gentlemen's fur coats, made of white sheepskin, each costs from 200,000 to 300,000 yuan. Those made of squirrel skin cost from 500,000 to 1,000,000 yuan each. Fox fur coats cost about 700,000 to 800,000 yuan each. More expensive fine fox fur robes cost about 1,500,000 to 1,600,000 yuan each. Other rare sable furs, because they are produced in Russia and there is not much stock in Shanghai, are also priced extraordinarily high. Those who have one or two pieces are selling and buying them as if they were antiques. It is said that the market price ranges from 2,000,000 to 3,000,000 yuan to over 8,000,000 yuan each.</p>
<p>White Deer Sells the Most</p>
<p>For ladies' reversible fur-lined coats, the most popular white deer coats cost from 700,000 to 800,000 yuan to 1,200,000 to 1,300,000 yuan each. Cat fur coats cost from 400,000 to 600,000 yuan each. Spotted cat fur coats cost from 500,000 to 700,000 yuan each. Dyed sheepskin coats cost from 400,000 to 600,000 yuan each. Raccoon coats cost from 500,000 to 700,000 yuan each. More expensive yellow weasel, black fox, gray back, and leopard skin coats cost about 1,000,000 to 2,000,000 yuan each.</p>
<p>From the above market prices, it can be seen that the price range of the same type of goods is very large. This illustrates the complexity of the types of fur. The price varies depending on the density and looseness of the fur, the length of the guard hair, the color of the fur, the number of animals used for each fur coat, the complexity of the skinning, washing, and tanning process, and the size of the fur coat. These are certainly not things that those who wear fur coats would pay attention to.</p>
<p>Finally, the furriers presented their accurate estimates. They said: currently, two-thirds of the business in the fur industry depends on ladies' reversible fur-lined coats. The business that can be done with gentlemen's fur coats is less than one-third. Last year, when victory first arrived, it was said that after eight years of long-term resistance against the war, once the economy recovered, people could buy a new fur coat to celebrate the victorious New Year. However, sadly, last winter, the total turnover of the five major furriers at the Canidrome was only 300 million yuan. What a small number this is! At this point, the furriers returned to their initial complaints. Although it is bitter, there is an undeniable reality. For example, before the war, there were a total of thirty-four fur businesses, large and small. During the eight years of war, the source of furs was cut off. Without furs, what could the fur industry rely on? In the end, some closed down, some rested, and only eleven fur businesses of various sizes remained. More unfortunately, even these limited eleven fur businesses are unable to withstand the pressure of the current economic depression. Fashionable sons and daughters, are you moved by this? They are eagerly waiting for you to extend a warm hand to give them compassionate assistance!</p>

<p>Regarding the calculation of the cost of living index for workers in this city, after Zhou Shishu, a representative from the Municipal Government's Cost of Living Index Compilation Office, went to the Municipal General Labor Union to explain the calculation method of the index, representatives from various industry unions have successively raised inquiries and suggestions to the Municipal General Labor Union, which were summarized into seven items, the details of which have been reported in the newspaper. Upon investigation, the suggestions were forwarded by the Municipal General Labor Union to the Municipal Government, and a reply from the Municipal Government was received yesterday, stating: "According to the second item presented (canceling soybeans and wheat bran in the food category of the index table and improving the quality of Xian rice), from the perspective of nutritional considerations, polishing rice is actually detrimental to nutrition. The nutritional value of brown rice is far superior to that of high-quality white rice. The request should not be discussed. As for the remaining suggestions, they have been submitted to relevant departments for discussion to prepare for adoption."</p>

<p>The Municipal Health Bureau has recently been rectifying the city's sanitary environment. Plans have been made to improve various markets, vegetable markets, cemeteries, and slaughterhouses. The city's funeral parlors have been ordered not to allow coffins to be kept any longer, and there is currently no space for burial plots in public cemeteries, which is causing difficulties for the general public. A reporter visited the person in charge of the bureau, who said: due to the excessive accumulation of coffins over the past eight years, the cemetery space is limited. The existing public cemeteries are unable to cope with the existing coffins, and it is even more difficult to deal with those who have recently died. Therefore, the bureau intends to actively promote cremation and add public cemeteries to facilitate burials for the public. In addition to the existing Hongqiao, Wanguo, and Panyu cemeteries in the western district of Shanghai, and the First Cemetery in the northern district of Shanghai, privately owned land will be leased near the existing cemeteries for expansion. Land will also be sought in the Yangshupu area in the eastern district of Shanghai and the Pudong area in the southern district of Shanghai for construction.</p>

<h3 id="e106">A Study of Shanghai Street Names <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>When we look down at this world-class metropolis from the Shanghai sky, the dense buildings are separated by many roads, like a chessboard, perhaps even denser. These many horizontal and vertical arteries intertwine to create the prosperity of Shanghai. A person returning from the rear after the war, even if he is an "old Shanghai resident," will feel unfamiliar when he sees these many street names, because they have already undergone a major change. During the enemy's puppet regime, Shanghai street names were changed once. After the victory, the remnants left by the enemy's puppet regime naturally could not be allowed to remain, and the old street names were no longer applicable, so they were changed again, which can be said to be a three-time change of name. Shanghai street names have been changed more than once individually, but these two times were thorough changes, so everyone paid special attention. However, everyone has not yet firmly remembered these many new street names. When the tram arrives at the station, the ticket seller still calls out the old street names. When hiring a rickshaw, if you use the new street names, the rickshaw puller will stare blankly and not know what to do. Habit dictates that it will take time to promote them.</p>
<h3 id="e107">Alternative Street Names <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>There are many places in Shanghai whose names are inexplicable and cannot be found on the map. These many colloquial names of roads often make people who come to Shanghai for the first time at a loss. Now, let's list them side by side for reference. (Colloquial Name) (Old Street Name) Stone Road Fujian Road Daxin Street Hubei Road Little Garden, Zhejiang Road Guangxi Road Hankou Road area</p>
<h3 id="e108">The Origin of the Name "Stone Road" <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>This Fujian Road, where clothing stores gather, is commonly known as Stone Road. What is the reason for this? Thirty years ago, Shanghai roads, except for Nanking Road and Szechuan Road, which were made of fire bricks or iron elm wood, were all made of a mixture of sand and gravel. In addition, there were stone roads made of small and large crushed stones. When the concession was first opened, residents took water from Yangjingbang and Suzhou Creek. They went there together when the tide rose in the morning and evening. Daggou Bridge on Yangjingbang, Zhengjia Wooden Bridge, and Sanji Wharf on Suzhou Creek were all important water collection points. The roads near there were all paved with crushed stone pieces, which could prevent those who drew water from slipping and prevent the roads from collapsing due to water. Because Fujian Road connects the north and south waterways, it is entirely paved with crushed stone pieces, hence the name.</p>
<p>There is another legend. During the Daoguang period of the Qing Dynasty, there was a wealthy family named Li living on the east side of the county government in the city. His daughter married into the Qu family in the northern end of the Lao Zha Bridge. The Qu family was also wealthy, which can be said to be a good match. At this time, the concession had not been opened, and the roads outside the city were rugged and crisscrossed, making travel very inconvenient. The Li family bought thousands of large stones and hired people to pave them from Yangjingbang, along Fujian Road, all the way north to Lao Zha Bridge, placing one stone every foot, making it more convenient for his daughter to send her abundant dowry when she got married. From then on, it was known as Stone Road, which can also be said to be a "heroic act."</p>
<p>Some people also say that Stone Road should be written as Zha Road, and Zha refers to Lao Zha.</p>
<h3 id="e109">The Origin of the Name "Peng Road" <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>The road in front of the North Railway Station, which is the dividing line between China and the West, was previously called Boundary Road. The predecessor of Boundary Road was Wenchamshi Road, also known as Peng Road, which is translated from the English pronunciation.</p>
<p>Why is Wenchamshi Road called Luo Feng Road in English? There is a story behind it.</p>
<p>At that time, there was an American Episcopal Church Bishop named Boone, who, due to his frequent contact with Chinese people, also took a local Chinese name, called Wen Huilian. After the British and French successively opened concessions, the Americans were very envious and also hoped to have a concession. Wen Huilian wanted to build a church in Hongkou at that time, so he negotiated with the Shanghai Daotai. In 1848, the Shanghai Daotai generally designated the Hongkou area as a residential area for American expatriates, so Wen Huilian was actually the founder of the American concession.</p>
<p>Such an important figure who contributed to the history of the concession should naturally have his name moved to the road as a memorial. The English name is still called "Peng Road," and the Chinese name uses his Chinese surname. The bishop was formerly translated as Jianshi, so it became "Wenchamshi Road." However, this Chinese name seems a bit inexplicable, and the English name is very simple to read, so everyone calls it "Peng Road." Friends who don't usually walk on the road much will never find Peng Road. Peng Road is now renamed Tianmu Road</p>

<h3 id="e110">How Were the New Street Names Changed? <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>Shanghai street names were all translated from Western languages during the concession period. They were not easy to pronounce or remember, and some even had a bit of a "foreign" feel. After the Pacific War broke out, the enemy and puppet forces entered the concession and changed the street names. After the victory, the remnants of the enemy and puppet regime had to be removed, and restoring the old names was also considered inappropriate, so they were changed again.</p>
<p>This time, the government divided the city center into a grid. Zhongshan Road surrounds the outside, and Zhongzheng Road runs horizontally and vertically through it. Zhongshan Road originally started from Longhua, went west and north, and then reached Zhabei. This time, Huangpu Road was changed to Zhongshan East Road, Limar Road and Kangqu Road were changed to Zhongshan South Road, and then connected to the original Zhongshan Road, forming a large circle. Although there is still a gap, it has almost completely included the city area.</p>
<p>In the center of this circle, two more vertical and horizontal main lines are drawn. The original Avenue Edward VII, Avenue Foch, and Great Western Road from east to west. This long and wide road is naturally the main thoroughfare of Shanghai, and it was renamed Zhongzheng East Road, Zhongzheng Central Road, and Zhongzheng West Road. The original Rue Paul Henry, Rue des Soeurs, Avenue du Roi Albert, and Carter Road from the southern city to the north were renamed Zhongzheng South Road and Zhongzheng North Road.</p>
<p>"Unification" is the principle of renaming. All two or three connected roads are changed to a unified name and divided by east, west, north, and south. The roads from east to west will merge the original Ningbo Road (former French concession), Avenue Joffre, and Lujia Road into Linsen Road. The original Zhaojia Road, Avenue Lafayette, and Baiqi Central Road are merged into Fuxing Road. The original Route Conty, Avenue Haig, and Route Ferguson are merged into Jianguo Road. The original Bubbling Well Road is renamed Nanjing West Road, and the original Avenue Haig is renamed Beijing West Road. The same is true from south to north, and there are very good boundaries to divide them into South Road, Central Road, and North Road, namely Suzhou Creek and the boundary between the former Public Concession and the French Concession. All roads east of Tibet Road, north of Suzhou Creek, are North Road, those in the former French Concession are South Road, and those in the former Public Concession are Central Road. Following the example of the former Public Concession, Chinese place names are used.</p>
<p>Most of the newly renamed roads are named after place names, but there are a few exceptions. Zhongshan, Zhongzheng, and Linsen Roads are all named after people. Route Saipo Sai Road was renamed Yingshi Road to commemorate the martyr Chen Yingshi, because Mr. Yingshi's former residence was on Route Saipo Sai Road.</p>
<h3 id="e111">Classification of Street Names <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>Shanghai street names can be roughly divided into several categories. (1) Those that use Chinese province names and place names are the easiest to remember. Demar Road in the central area of the former Public Concession was like this, such as Nanjing Road, Jiujiang Road, Hankou Road, Zhejiang Road, Jiangxi Road, and so on. There are many in the Hongkou and Zhabei areas. (2) Those named after buildings, such as Bubbling Well Road named after the Jing'an Temple, Consulate Road named after the French Consulate, Vegetable Market Road near the small vegetable market, and Yu Garden Road near the Yu Garden. (3) Those that follow old place names, such as Xiaoshadu Road because it leads to Xiaoshadu and Xujiahui Road because it leads to Xujiahui.</p>
<p>Almost half of Shanghai's street names use foreign names, mostly personal names, including diplomats stationed in China, consuls stationed in Shanghai, missionaries, expatriate merchants, former directors of the Municipal Council, and directors of the Public Works Bureau, who were directly or indirectly related to Shanghai.</p>
<p>There are not many street names that use foreign place names, such as Tokyo Road and He Wan Road, which cannot be included as examples of foreign place names, and there are also Hong Kong Road, Macau Road, etc., which cannot be regarded as foreign place names.</p>
<p>There are also very few street names named after Chinese people. There are only a few because the concession was in the hands of foreigners in the past, and they did not pay attention to the Chinese. These few were only willing to put their names on the street signs due to special relationships.</p>
<h3 id="e112">Avenue Joffre <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>This Avenue Joffre, which is considered mysterious and prosperous, is both poetic and historically meaningful.</p>
<p>Avenue Joffre was originally one of the roads built by the former French Concession beyond its boundaries. It was officially included in the boundary after the third expansion of the concession in the third year of the Republic of China. This road stretches from Jieti Road in the east to Haig Road in the west, measuring 5,500 meters in length, and is the longest and straightest road in the former French Concession, now called Linsen Central Road.</p>
<p>Avenue Joffre was originally named Avenue Beauchamp. The name "Beauchamp" is the name of a director of the former French Municipal Council. He was continuously elected for seventeen times, from 1881 to 1907, and also served as the general manager six times. The construction of Avenue Joffre was decided in 1900 and completed in 1901. At this time, Beauchamp was serving as the general manager, so the road was named Avenue Beauchamp.</p>
<p>During the First World War, the commander-in-chief of the French Eastern Army saved France from the brink of death with the Battle of the Marne, which was a great achievement. Joffre had been to Shanghai in 1885, when he was only a junior engineering officer. Because of this connection, the authorities of the former French Concession renamed the most important and prosperous Avenue Beauchamp to Avenue Joffre. At that time, General Joffre specially sent a letter of thanks amidst his military duties. After the end of the European War, General Joffre came to Shanghai for sightseeing on March 9, 1922. At that time, there was a grand occasion on Avenue Joffre, and the name of Avenue Joffre was officially announced on that day.</p>
<p>Avenue Beauchamp, which was named after Beauchamp's seventeen years of service in the concession, has since become a historical relic. In the triangle between Avenue Joffre, Rue Bayle, and Route Mercier, a triangular plot was opened as a park in 1920, named Beauchamp Park, as a replacement souvenir, which is now renamed Dihua Children's Republic.</p>
<h3 id="e113">"Avenue Edward VII" Transformed from Yangjing Canal: Canal Filling and Road Construction Took More Than Two Years <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>Filling the riverbanks and building roads was the first act of kindness by foreigners after Shanghai opened as a port. This land, once full of rivers and ditches a century ago, has now been transformed. The widest of these, Avenue Edward VII, was created by rebuilding the Yangjing Canal.</p>
<p>The Yangjing Canal was originally a small waterway, serving as the boundary between the old British and French Concessions. Before the widespread use of tap water, this canal, along with the Suzhou Creek, was where residents obtained water. However, it was extremely filthy, with manure boats and firewood boats gathering in the canal. In summer, people passing by would cover their noses.</p>
<p>The earliest bridges, such as the San Mao Ge Bridge, Zhengjia Wooden Bridge, and West New Bridge, were all dilapidated wooden structures. Later, in 1856, the British and French Concessions planned to build a bridge over the Yangjing Canal to connect the Bunds of the two concessions. The bridge was completed on March 25, 1856. It was 69 feet long, 30 feet wide, and had three arches, all constructed with Singapore timber. The ends of the bridge were made of granite, costing a total of more than 2,000 silver dollars.</p>
<p>By 1914, both concessions felt that this stinking canal had no need to exist and decided to fill it in and convert it into a road. The project of filling the canal and paving the road took more than two years, and was completed in 1916. Before the road was built, the earliest name for the area along the Yangjing Canal was Yangjing Canal Bund Road, later changed to Songjiang Road. When the road was completed, it was renamed Avenue Edward VII, which is now East Zhongzheng Road. This name was taken from King Edward VII of England, and the pronunciation and spelling were based on the French version, hence "Edward."</p>
<p>After the Yangjing Canal was filled, there was also a negotiation regarding the issue of water access to the Huangpu River. According to the concession agreements, the old British Concession was bounded to the south by the Yangjing Canal, and the old French Concession was bounded to the north by the Yangjing Canal. Therefore, the Yangjing Canal waterway was not within either the British or French Concessions. In the summer of the eleventh year of the Republic of China (1922), the Pudong Reclamation Bureau proposed using the mouth of the Yangjing Canal as a ferry terminal, but this was not agreed to by the authorities of the former two concessions, and the plan was not realized. In the spring of the twenty-third year of the Republic of China (1934), the Municipal Public Works Bureau again consulted with the former Shanghai Municipal Council, and as a result, the former Shanghai Municipal Council moved the original Pier 15 on the Bund outside Beijing Road southward, freeing up suitable shoreline for the construction of a municipal ferry terminal, which is the current municipal ferry terminal.</p>
<p>The upstream of the Yangjing Canal was originally called North Chang Canal, and after Avenue Edward VII, it was changed to a road, initially called Daxi Road, also known as Changbang Road, named after the canal. During the First World War, the French Army General Foch achieved great merit, so Changbang Road was renamed Foch Road, which is now East Zhongzheng Road.</p>
<h3 id="e114">Memories Left Over from the Taiping Rebellion <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>Shanghai has three roads that are related to the historical events of the Taiping Rebellion: Xujiahui Road, Haig Road (now Huashan Road), and Gordon Road (now Jiangning Road). In 1860, the Taiping army defeated the Qing army besieging Nanjing, then attacked Changzhou and Suzhou, causing great shock in Shanghai. Shanghai Daotai (local governor) Wu Xu requested the assistance of British and French troops for defense on one hand, and hired the American Frederick Townsend Ward to organize a foreign army, later known as the Ever Victorious Army.</p>
<p>On August 17th of that year, the Taiping army advanced to Xujiahui. The 25 French troops stationed there had already withdrawn, and Shanghai entered a state of war. For the convenience of troop movements, a military road was begun, from the west gate of Shanghai County, along Fangbang Bridge to Xujiahui, which is now Xujiahui Road. Later, the Ever Victorious Army led by Ward also built a road, starting from the banks of the Suzhou Creek, passing through Fahua Town, and reaching Xujiahui. When the military affairs ended, the former Shanghai Municipal Council repaired it, and also named the section from Jing'an Temple to Xujiahui as Xujiahui Road. In 1914, the old French Concession expanded to Xujiahui, and the southern section of this road became the boundary road between the French and Chinese areas. After the end of World War I, in commemoration of the British General Haig's wartime achievements, it was renamed Haig Road from 1921 onwards.</p>
<p>Gordon</p>
<p>was a staff officer for the British garrison at the time. In 1862, when the Taiping army attacked Shanghai for the third time, he assisted Li Hongzhang in capturing Shanghai County, and successively recovered Kunshan, Songjiang, Suzhou, and other places, achieving considerable merit. After the affair was settled, the road was named after Gordon in commemoration.</p>
<p>Jassief was the name of a French warship that arrived in Shanghai in the spring of 1853. At that time, the Taiping army was attacking Nanjing, and the Shanghai Daotai wanted to borrow it to go to Nanjing to help the Qing army fight. However, the French Consul Montigny refused, and the matter was dropped. Although the matter did not succeed, the name of this French warship was left behind as the name of a road in Shanghai.</p>
<h3 id="e115">Alcock Road: In Memory of the Most Detestable British Consul <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>In Hongkou, there was a road called "Alcock Road," which has now been renamed Anguo Road. This road starts from the location of the Ward Road Prison, slightly westward to the north, and can directly reach the eastern end of Yuezhou Road, near the boundary of the former International Settlement. The road is not very long, and it is not considered particularly important. However, from the perspective of the history of the former International Settlement, it is quite relevant.</p>
<p>Alcock was the second British Consul in Shanghai, taking office in 1846. In older books, it is translated as Ali Guo. After taking office, he engaged in many brash incidents.</p>
<p>The area outside the Waibaidu Bridge (Garden Bridge) on the Bund, where the British Consulate is now located, was purchased as a base. The initiative to purchase the land was started by the first British Consul, Balfour, but Alcock followed suit, continued negotiations, and finally obtained the approval of his government. In 1848, the area of the former British Concession expanded from 830 mu (approximately 137 acres) to 2,820 mu (approximately 466 acres). This was also the result of negotiations between Alcock and the Shanghai Daotai Lin Gui at the time.</p>
<p>Alcock Humiliates and Beats the Shanghai Daotai</p>
<p>In the year of the concession expansion, a conflict occurred between British missionaries and grain boat sailors in the Qingpu area near Shanghai. The injured missionary returned to Shanghai and reported to the consulate. Alcock immediately visited the Shanghai Daotai, unilaterally siding with the British missionary and demanding that the perpetrators be punished and compensation paid. At this time, the Shanghai Daotai was no longer Lin Gui, and he was not afraid of "foreign" flattery. He told him in a serious tone, "A petty quarrel is not worth investigating deeply." Who knew that Alcock, upon hearing this, became enraged, forgetting his status as a dignified diplomat, and picked up the long-handled whip in his hand to beat the Shanghai Daotai's head. Such a barbaric act could only be met with a dismissive departure in the Shanghai Daotai's office, where weak nations had no diplomacy. He said to the Shanghai County Magistrate Jin Xian, "Shanghai's jurisdiction is a mix of Chinese and foreigners. Civil fights are extremely common. Asking me to suppress my own people to curry favor with foreigners, I would rather lose my official position." However, in the end, Li Xingyuan, the superior Liangjiang Governor, fearing trouble, accepted Alcock's unreasonable demands, arrested ten Pudong sailors, sent them to the British Consulate, displayed them in stocks on the Bund, and paid 200 taels of silver as medical expenses to the injured missionary. It's a pity that the righteous Shanghai Daotai was beaten for nothing.</p>
<p>Promoted to Minister: Ambitious and Arrogant</p>
<p>After the rise of the Taiping Rebellion, the former concession adopted a so-called armed neutrality policy, arbitrarily revised the land regulations, and organized the Shanghai Municipal Council. To trace the origins of this, Alcock was also one of the initiators. Perhaps it was for these achievements that he was later promoted to minister to China. After becoming minister, he was very protective of the Shanghai Municipal Council, which he had created. Contrary to the original intentions of the former British Minister Bruce and the American Minister to China, Anson Burlingame, he revised the land regulations that had already been approved by the foreign taxpayers in the former concession, deleting the section in the articles that included Chinese advisory committee members. Alcock's style was not only biased against China, but he also had a desire to dominate the Shanghai Municipal Council, not hesitating to use his authority to overturn the original plan.</p>
<p>Willful and Arbitrary: Bad Impression</p>
<p>Alcock was willful and arbitrary, and the Chinese had an extremely negative impression of him. The elders of Shanghai called him the British consul with the worst attitude. However, the British government was very pleased with his work in China, and therefore, the British Emperor bestowed upon him the title of knight.</p>
<h3 id="e116">Roads Named After Chinese People <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>In the former concession roads named after foreigners were numerous, but roads named after Chinese people were pitifully few. The most well-known was Zhu Bao San Road, once renamed Yu Qiaqing Road, and a not very well-known Lin Gui Road.</p>
<p>Lin Gui Road is north of Pu Shi Road and south of Ju Ji Da Road, a short, dirty alley. This was the earliest road in the concession named after a Chinese person, in memory of Shanghai Daotai Lin Gui. Due to a mistake, "Lin" was written as "Ling," and it became Ling Gui Road. Lin Gui was a Manchu. He served as Shanghai Daotai in 1849. Although he came from an official examination background, he did not shed his rough habits. The existence of the French Concession in Shanghai was due to Lin Gui's ambiguous agreement. Therefore, from the French perspective, Lin Gui was worthy of gratitude, so they used this road to commemorate this Shanghai Daotai. This was the only road at that time named after a Chinese person.</p>
<p>In the past, during the heyday of American goods sales, Zhu Bao San Road was bustling with people. This was to commemorate the Shanghai merchant Zhu Bao San. Zhu Bao San, from Dinghai, had been engaged in business in Shanghai for a long time. He served as the president of the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce from 1918 to 1920 and had a high position in the business community, owning a considerable amount of real estate. It is said that the land for Zhu Bao San Road also belonged to the Zhu family. However, the reason his name was written on the street sign was not because of his real estate, but because the French Concession had received a lot of help from Zhu in the beginning. Zhu Bao San Road has now been renamed Hankou Road.</p>
<p>Yu Qiaqing was also a prominent Ningbo merchant in Shanghai, who served as the president of the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce and a Chinese director of the Shanghai Municipal Council. Chinese and foreigners alike recognized that he often served the community and established many public welfare undertakings in the concession. Therefore, on his seventieth birthday, Xizang Road was renamed Yu Qiaqing Road in commemoration. When the Yu Qiaqing Road naming ceremony was held on October 1, 1936, it was quite a grand occasion. The Chinese team of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps, founded by Yu, paraded on the road, which made them look even more powerful. But this road has now been renamed Xizang Road.</p>

<h3 id="e117">Original Road Names in the Early Years of the Shanghai Concessions <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>In the early years of the opening of the Shanghai concessions, although the area was small and there were not many roads, the road names were very chaotic and lacked any system. At the same time, there were many similar or approximate road names, which made it even more confusing. Most of these road names were given by foreigners for their own use, and if they were translated into Chinese, they would be very unpleasant to read. Now, I will list many of the original road names of the old British Concession below:</p>
<p>Sichuan Road, initially named Quan Street, was soon renamed Jiangsu Road.</p>
<p>Jiangxi Road: originally Church Street</p>
<p>Henan Road: Boundary Street</p>
<p>Shandong Road: Temple Street</p>
<p>Shanxi Road: Old Gate Road</p>
<p>Tianjin Road: Ball Field Lane</p>
<p>Beijing Road: Consulate Road</p>
<p>Nanjing Road: Garden Lane</p>
<p>Jiujiang Road: Towpath Road</p>
<p>Hankou Road: Customs Road</p>
<p>Fujian Road: Church Road</p>
<p>Guangxi Road: India Road</p>
<p>These were many of the most original road names in the concession. It was not until the end of 1865 that a strict resolution was passed, changing the north-south roads within the boundary to Chinese province names, and the east-west roads to the names of important Chinese cities. These are the names that people generally call today.</p>
<p>The roads in the Hongkou area were named after Indian place names. The translations of these road names into Chinese (transliterations) are as follows:</p>
<p>济宁路 (Jining Road): Elgin Road</p>
<p>河间路 (Hejian Road): Bombay Road</p>
<p>置州路 (Zhizhou Road): Colombo Road</p>
<p>黑龙路 (Heilong Road): Calcutta Road</p>
<p>凉州路 (Liangzhou Road): Kabul Road</p>
<p>临清路 (Linqing Road): Kandahar Road</p>
<p>宁国路 (Ningguo Road): Lahore Road</p>
<p>宁武路 (Ningwu Road): Lucknow Road</p>
<p>眉州路 (Meizhou Road): Karachi Road</p>
<p>海州路 (Haizhou Road): Benares Road</p>
<p>桂阳路 (Guiyang Road): Cawnpore Road</p>
<p>平凉路 (Pingliang Road): Madras Road</p>
<p>"Indian writing is inherently difficult to read, and these many road names were really too difficult to remember. The former Shanghai Municipal Council, fearing that the Chinese would find it difficult to read, felt that these many road names would never be popular. Therefore, in 1915, a new batch of road names was redefined to replace these hard-to-remember Indian words, and they have been used ever since."</p>

<p>The origin of the name Jessfield Road, which stretches from Jing'an Temple and Yuyuan Road to Brenan Road, has a very interesting romantic story.</p>
<p>"A Portuguese man living on Jessfield Road, one day in Hongkou, passed by the tent of a circus and heard a woman sobbing sadly. This aroused his curiosity, and he went inside to inquire. It turned out that the poor girl was sad because she could not bear the abuse of the circus master. The Portuguese man was filled with compassion and paid a price to redeem the girl.</p>
<p>After the girl left the circus, she was taken in by the church and later sent to the United States to study. Several years later, she returned to Shanghai, grateful for the Portuguese man's kindness, and married him.</p>
<p>The girl's name was Jess. So the Portuguese man named the road where he lived Jessfield Road. Later, even Caojiadu was called Jessfield Village, Zhaofeng Park was called Jessfield Park, and the West Station was also called Jessfield Station. Jessfield Road has now been renamed Fanwangdu Road.</p>

<p>Shanghai's many diverse roads are already difficult to distinguish, and the streets with the same name in the past made it even more confusing.</p>
<p>Ningbo Road: one south of Beijing Road, one between Minguo Road and Montigny Road in the former French Concession.</p>
<p>Washington Road: one east of Taopeng Road in Hongkou, one near Guangfu Road in Zhabei.</p>
<p>Taiwan Road: one east of Fujian Road, one between the Bund and Minguo Road.</p>

<h3 id="e120">Warning for Chinese Industry: Japanese Woolen Goods Will Be Heavily Sold in the Far East <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] Recently, MacArthur's headquarters ordered the Japanese Board of Trade to produce 2.16 million yards of woolen fabrics for export to the Far East market. At the same time, the headquarters' Economic and Scientific Section stated that this woolen fabric will be the first export product made by Japan after the war. This news is nothing less than a warning for China's nascent woolen textile industry and other industries!</p>
<p>China's woolen textile industry has only twenty years of history and has not yet emerged from the stage of nascent industry. In today's situation, neither its technical level nor its raw material supply can compete with advanced countries. A well-placed woolen textile merchant told the reporter: Their machines have been depreciating for nine years, and there is no opportunity to replenish them. What can be bought in Shanghai is second-rate goods, and their efficiency cannot be compared with the latest equipment. But if they order from foreign countries, it will take three years to deliver the goods because of their own needs. Under this unequal technology, coupled with China's unique high wages, can we compete with foreign goods?</p>
<p>Wool Produced in the Northwest Cannot Be Used to Weave High-End Goods</p>
<p>The prospects for the supply of raw materials are similarly discouraging. The wool of the Northwest, because of the neglect of selection, cannot be used to weave high-end woolen fabrics. The reporter personally compared the Northwest wool with Australian imports and could not praise the domestic product. It is said that ten days ago, a key official of the Qinghai Provincial Government was ordered to come to Shanghai to purchase woolen textile machinery because the Qinghai Provincial Government was preparing to use huge capital to establish a modern woolen textile factory. This spirit of construction is worthy of admiration. In the future, the products of this factory may be able to gain a foothold in the Northwest market; but due to human habits and the nature of beauty, it is still insufficient to compete with foreign goods. However, on the other hand, if foreign wool is used as raw material, it will be extremely difficult, which is the main pain of China's woolen textile industry today. Why is it so difficult to obtain world wool? The first is the inevitable phenomenon after the war. Everyone has been tightening their belts during the war, entrusting the plan to "improve the standard of living" to the post-war era. Now that the war has passed like a nightmare, the plan to improve the standard of living needs to be actively implemented.</p>
<p>Britain Has Long Been Monopolizing the International Wool Market</p>
<p>Second, the whole world should thank the British politicians and financiers, who have forged amazing business acumen in the London fog. Long before the war ended, they had already foreseen that there would be a shortage of raw wool after the war. So last year, a wool conference was held in the UK, deciding that the governments of the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, and the Union of South Africa would form a large company called the "United Kingdom and Dominion Wool Disposals Ltd." to sell surplus wool around the world. Now this company has been formally organized, and it is presided over by a British person. After the establishment of this organization, wool can no longer flow freely in the international market. Therefore, China's woolen textile industry is reluctantly existing in a state of dependence on others.</p>
<p>MacArthur's Headquarters Supports the Japanese Woolen Textile Industry</p>
<p>The most distressing fact is that the supply of raw wool, one of the five great powers, China, is not even as good as Japan, which is occupied! After Japan was occupied, its woolen textile industry was able to maintain production because the US military supplied it with military goods. At the same time, Japanese merchants have applied to MacArthur's headquarters for approval to import 350,000 bales of wool, one-third of which will be exported abroad after being made into woolen fabrics; the remaining wool will be kept for their own use. In contrast, on the day that the British trade delegation to China arrived in Beijing, our experts had earnestly discussed this issue with their textile representatives, but there were no concrete results. However, it seems that it is already a foregone conclusion that the Japanese woolen textile industry will obtain Australian wool.</p>
<p>The Weak Foundation of the Chinese Woolen Textile Industry Is Lamentable</p>
<p>The prospects for production also do not give us more confidence. Nowadays, due to the regulations of work discipline, the efficiency of general factories is far less than before the war. And China's existing woolen textile spindles are few in number. Taking the China Textile Construction Company as a pillar, it only has 50,000 spindles, and because many are damaged, they are still in the repair stage and the start of work is pending. But as for Japan, it is really worthy of our vigilance. Before the war, there were a total of 1.38 million spindles, and after the war, there were only 480,000 broken spindles left. The reporter learned from authoritative sources that it immediately has 320,000 spindles that can be mobilized. Not only that, but Japan is also preparing to restore its pre-war scale. As for the work ethic of the Japanese? A week ago, a member of the British Labour Party went to Japan to visit at the invitation of MacArthur. After returning to England, he said publicly. The Japanese are magical workers. Their vitality and hard work have not been damaged by the war. If viewed purely from a material point of view, their revival is inevitable.</p>
<p>To Break Through the Environment, Only a Thorough Transformation Is Possible</p>
<p>In this bleak situation, we should seek a way to deal with ourselves. The reporter feels that the only way to go is that China needs to have a long-term overall plan, from the improvement of sheep breeds to the promotion of woolen fabrics. An experienced factory owner told me: The improvement of Chinese sheep breeds will take at least three generations (fifteen years); to have a big effect, it will take twenty years. The cost is of course very large. Only the state can do and is willing to do this kind of long-term large-scale business. The acquisition of new machines also requires state assistance. We cannot wait for three years while others destroy our weak foundation under overwhelming advantage. In the year before the end of the war, two American textile experts were sent to Chongqing to contact the wartime production bureau, wanting to transform China's entire textile industry with American mechanical technology to cope with a possible long-term war. This was a golden opportunity for our country, but the evolution of the situation eliminated it. After the war, talking to the United States about the supply of textile machinery, or the joint establishment of a textile machinery factory in our country by China and the United States, was all yes and no, and no clue could be obtained. This is natural and not surprising. Today, when Japan's industrial power is threatening us again, simply hoping that the Allies will suppress Japan is neither a fundamental solution nor will it be effective. The only way to defend ourselves is to strengthen ourselves and compete; in particular, the Chinese industrial community must have this ambition and spirit.</p>
<h3 id="e121">Jian Textile Expands Production Capacity: Self-Installation of Generators Can Supply Half of the Required Electricity <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>Jian Textile Company, in view of the insufficient power supply in the city, which affects the production volume of its affiliated factories, in order to remedy this, specially applied to the Executive Yuan's Materials Supply Bureau for the allocation of four of the latest small turbine generators, which are installed in the company's 19th factory. The installation of machine parts has now begun. Each of these generators can generate 1,000 kilowatts of electricity per day, and they were shipped to Shanghai from the United States and allocated to Jian Textile by President Song. According to the company's recent total number of spindles operating day and night, there are approximately 600,000 spindles, and the electricity required for a full day is more than 8,000 kilowatts. Therefore, after the generators are installed, they can solve more than one-half of the electricity demand.</p>
<p>According to the person in charge of the company, the company's plan to increase production can be divided into three items: (1) Find ways to supply electricity on its own, (2) Collect more cotton, assign personnel to purchase it in various places, and the quota for this year is 800,000 dan (approximately 40,000 metric tons). More than 50,000 dan have already been collected in Hankou, Zhengzhou, Shashi, Nantong, and other places, and large quantities of cotton can also be collected in Tianjin, Shenyang, and the Eastern Salt Reclamation Area, (3) Increase technical personnel to strengthen technical capabilities and improve technical deficiencies. In addition, the company has established a branch company in Shenyang, Northeast China, with considerable production capacity.</p>
<h3 id="e122">The Problem of High-Interest Loans: Three Causes and Three Solutions <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] High-interest loans are the greatest obstacle to the development of industry and commerce today. Today, our reporter made a special visit to a certain banker to inquire about the causes and ways to eliminate them. The banker replied: Today, the general lending interest rate of commercial banks is 12.3%, which cannot be said to be too high from the bank's perspective. After all, after the bank receives deposits from the outside world, it must deposit 20% into the Central Bank, reserve a considerable amount as preparation, and then pay interest on deposits. All of these considered, the income is indeed large, but the expenses are also considerable. Tracing the causes of high-interest loans today, firstly, the value of currency is unstable, and the purchasing power of legal tender continues to decline, which relatively leads to the continuous rise in prices, and high-interest loans naturally arise. At the same time, wealthy people in the private sector purchase large amounts of gold and US dollars to preserve the value of currency, resulting in a severe shortage of funds in the market and an increase in interest rates. Secondly, the scope of business of today's banks is much smaller than before the war. For example, foreign exchange trading was originally a type of business, but today it has been controlled. Domestic remittances are still allowed to be operated, but the low exchange rate of national banks makes it fundamentally impossible for commercial banks to compete. As a last resort, they can only concentrate their efforts on operating loans and rely on them as the main source of income. Thirdly, in the past, there was a period when prices continued to rise without any fluctuations, so many merchants borrowed money to hoard goods, which increased interest rates due to supply and demand relationships. At present, bank interest rates, except for industries and businesses with special prosperity, are generally unbearable for long-term burdens. In terms of procedures, for the sake of prudence, unsecured loans have become a thing of the past, and mortgage loans are usually used. As for eliminating high-interest loans, we must start from the root. Generally speaking, there are three methods: (1) Rebuild the monetary system to stabilize its value and restore people's confidence. In this way, a large amount of US dollars and gold will be thrown out, and once there is a lot of money in the market, the market interest rate will naturally fall! (2) The national bank should abandon its tight credit policy, because if industry and commerce cannot obtain low-interest loans from legitimate financial institutions, they can only seek them from the black market at high interest rates. In this way, the black market interest rate will be pulled higher and higher. (3) Bureaucratic capital should be cracked down on, because this type of business with a background occupies a special and superior position, oppressing industrial and commercial businesses without a background, making them maintain themselves by borrowing money, without being able to take into account the height of the interest, which also indirectly promotes one cause of high-interest loans.</p>
<h3 id="e123">Industrial and Commercial Enterprises Face Crisis, Banks Are No Exception <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, according to an authoritative figure in the city's financial circles, some people in society believe that industrial and commercial enterprises are facing a crisis, and the main emergency rescue method is to conduct emergency loans and low-interest loans to the banking industry. Little do they know that the financial community is also encountering difficulties. Compared with the total amount of deposits in various banks today, it is about 200 times that of before the war. The assets of various banks before the war were 3 billion, and now they are about 600 billion, while the expenses of various banks have increased 5,600 times compared with before. It is naturally impossible to maintain expenses with a small number of deposits, so abnormal phenomena such as high-interest loans have appeared. Also, because the amount of deposits in each bank is small, the capital must be tight, forming a phenomenon of demand exceeding supply, which is also one of the reasons for creating high interest rates. Therefore, if the industrial and commercial community wants to seek emergency loans or low-interest loans from the financial community, in fact, the banks themselves have insufficient capital and are also encountering difficulties. Some banks are currently convening shareholders' meetings and increasing capital to save their own survival.</p>
<p>Cultural Enterprises</p>
<p>Datong Cultural Enterprise Co., Ltd. is a new cultural production organization with the largest scale. The company operates paper-making, publishing, and the manufacturing and production of stationery. It has also established a paper-making factory in Huqiu Mountain in Suzhou, producing newspapers and writing paper, etc. The company originally planned to print and edit its own books and strive for cultural undertakings thoroughly. However, due to insufficient funds, although the paper-making factory was prepared, it had high-interest loans of more than 600 million yuan. In addition, with the influx of foreign goods, domestic paper was affected. Although it tried hard to struggle, it has been increasingly oppressed by high-interest loans, resulting in inflexible turnover, and has declared liquidation. As for the company's assets, it is said that they can still offset the debts it owes.</p>
<p>Pawnshops</p>
<p>The pawnshop industry in this city is divided into various types, such as pawn, mortgage, and pledge. The interest charged by member pawnshops is relatively low. Other pawnshops charge interest of 35% per month, plus storage box fees. There are also pawnshops (i.e., pledge shops) that charge interest every ten days, with some charging as much as 5%. Therefore, the general poor people currently regard pawnshops as a fearful path. Even if they need to pawn, they would rather sell their clothes once and for all, resulting in a sharp decline in the business of general pawnshops. Yesterday, our reporter spoke with pawnshop personnel, who said that most of the pawnshop funds are taking the opportunity to operate underground money shops, which charge low interest rates, about 25%, but there is no consumption and the transactions are in bulk, unlike the piecemeal procedures of pawnshops. Moreover, some pawnshop owners regard pledging as a sideline. Although the storefront is still open, they actually send people to run around the north and south, doing their own single business. Due to the decline of the pawnshop industry, the used clothing industry has also been affected. Old-fashioned clothes are difficult to sell, and the source of new-fashioned clothes has been cut off. Therefore, recently, the used clothing industry has also changed its style, taking advantage of low labor costs and making new clothes for sale. Some have even changed course and are retailing cotton cloth to maintain their business.</p>
<h3 id="e124">After the End of World War II, the Demand for Silver Increased Sharply, and the US Silver Production This Year Was Not Very Saw-Toothed. <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters, San Francisco, 2nd] The San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank expects that the shortage of silver will continue to be felt for a considerable period of time in the future. It is said that since the end of the war, the demand for silver has exceeded supply by a large margin. The Treasury Department's circulating silver reserves have decreased from a peak of 1.4 billion ounces in May 1942 to 400.3 million ounces at the end of 1945. World wartime silver production is constantly decreasing. In the first half of 1946, US silver production was only 9 million ounces, while the production in 1941 was 71.1 million ounces, and the production in 1945 was 29 million ounces. In mid-1946, the general need for US white eyes is estimated to be 120 million ounces, while last year's global production was only 160 million ounces. Therefore, the United States alone can consume the silver currently produced worldwide.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 2nd] After the United States raised the purchase price of silver to 91.25 US cents per ounce this summer, 16 silver-producing countries exported to the US market. In August, US silver imports reached 9.3 million ounces, and in July, 8.9 million ounces. This was only 1.2 million ounces in May when it was 71.1 cents per ounce. June was 1.5 million ounces.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Ottawa, 2nd] In August, Canada's total gold production was more than 231,000 ounces, while in July it was 239,500 ounces. Silver production fell from 1,265,821 ounces in July to 1,185,905 ounces.</p>
<p>Cigarette Shops</p>
<p>According to the Cigarette, Soap, Candle and Match Industry Association, since the victory last year, the cigarette shops in this city have been experiencing sluggish business, and several have closed down every day. The reasons for this are nothing more than the pressure of high-interest loans and the impact of heavy government taxes. Moreover, foreign goods are competing for sales, and domestic cigarettes are in a slump. The price of foreign cigarettes is low, and smuggling is rampant. There are vendors all over the streets and alleys, with no expenses or taxes, selling at low prices. Therefore, cigarette shops cannot compete with them. More than 4,000 cigarette shops in the city have successively requested the industry association to appeal to the government for relief. Yesterday, it was reported that the Mei Chang Xie Chang Dao Cigarette Company had also closed down.</p>

<p>Regarding the auction of enemy and puppet factories and the priority purchase by industrialists from the rear, the Enemy and Puppet Property Processing Bureau of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Central Trust Bureau have repeatedly consulted and decided that the purchase will be made by industrialists from the rear. The factories have now been taken over in batches. The original 22 factories were entrusted by the Ministry of Economic Affairs to industrialists from the rear as factory directors to prepare for resumption of work. However, the results of the resumption of work were not good. Now, most of them are purchased by the original factory directors, who are actively planning to refresh the system and increase production. It is reported that the current 22 factories have only 1,500 workers. After preliminary reorganization, it is expected to increase to more than 5,000 people. Then, the unemployed workers from the rear who have been unemployed for a long time can all obtain work. The list of factory names and the names of the purchasers of the 22 factories are listed below.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Hankou, 3rd] The turmoil at Zhonghua University against the president has become increasingly acute. Yesterday, students from the attached high school and university students engaged in a "full-scale brawl," with three seriously injured and more than ten slightly injured. Middle school students and some teachers and professors posted slogans listing ten counts of Wang Yihuan's malfeasance, etc., vowing to drive Wang out of the school. Later, the Education Department sent unarmed police to dissuade them, and the fighting stopped. This afternoon, the school authorities entertained reporters and reported on the incident. It was said that a few lecturers and staff members requested promotions and fought for salaries that were not approved, and the middle school department was controlled by the former president Chen Shi, so it was also related to Chen's instigation.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 3rd] Huang Rujin, president of Changchun University, came to Beiping from the Northeast and then to Beijing. Huang told reporters today that three points should be paid special attention to in education in the Northeast: First, special attention must be paid to language and writing. In the past, students used "Concord Language," that is, the characters were Chinese characters, but what they talked and wrote was Japanese grammar, and the students' attitude was also extremely humble, so it is urgent to thoroughly correct this. Second, the enemy's technical, industrial, and scientific foundations in the Northeast, and the research on soil, animals, and plants, etc., should be well utilized and continued. The reason why Changchun University established six colleges is actually because Changchun has six universities run by the enemy. Third, the patriotic enthusiasm of Northeastern students needs to be strengthened, that is, history and geography subjects should be taught from scratch. Also, Northeastern students have a very good spirit of autonomy because they have been ruled by the enemy for fifteen years and struggled to survive.</p>

<h3 id="e139">The A-League Football Game Initially Had an Upset: Youyou Defeats the Jewish Team, 2-0, The Dark Horse Suffers Its First Waterloo <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>In this year's A-League football league, the Jewish team is known as a strong team. Last week, it defeated the Soviet Union 3-1, and the crowd paid attention to it. However, to everyone's surprise, it encountered Waterloo yesterday morning and lost to Youyou 2-0. It can be said to be a major upset and a proud masterpiece of Youyou. Youyou's victory was due to its defense, and the Jewish team could not cross the line. In the second half, Youyou took advantage of the wind and launched a major offensive. Cao Qinfang first scored, followed by a penalty kick, laying the foundation for victory. More than a thousand spectators in Jin Yuan Park were overjoyed.</p>
<p>The Battle Process</p>
<p>He Chunhui was the referee. The Jewish team, with the remaining power of defeating the Soviet Union, and with the help of the Italian general Silati Baojie, and Jack Jacob making a comeback, everyone thought that they could win without a doubt. Unexpectedly, Youyou would be motivated and act, which was unexpected. In the first half, although the Jewish team encountered the wind, it was of no use because of Youyou's strong resistance, and no record was opened. After the break, the battle restarted. Youyou took advantage of the wind and launched a major offensive. The Jewish team tried its best to defend. After holding on for 20 minutes, Cao Qinfang shot, hit the left goal post, bounced off the right goal post and went inside. Youyou broke the record first. After that, the battle situation was in a stalemate. Until the 35th minute, Manya committed a foul and was sentenced to a penalty kick. Cao Qinfang took the knife and scored in one fell swoop, making it 2-0. The Jewish counter-offensive was in vain. When Yuan Kuntian was sent off the field, the game ended hastily, and the troops were withdrawn. Youyou won 2-0, which was a proud work.</p>

<p>The Result Was Four to One in the First Half:</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 pm, Donghua and Hequn fought in Yiyuan, and 3,000 fans were quite lively. Judge Deng Xiaoliang blew the whistle to start the game. Donghua Ade did not appear, and Huang Kehou served as the center forward. Donghua's offensive was fierce, but because Hequn's luck was smooth, Donghua Teng did not score. Hequn also occasionally had the opportunity to invade Donghua's penalty area, but it was even more difficult to succeed. No record was opened within half an hour. It was not until the 34th minute that Youliang got the ball on the edge, rushed forward quickly, went deep into the hinterland, and immediately hooked it in. Li Yao waited for the right moment, and his left foot rose up and went into the net in response. Two minutes later, Han Longhai dribbled the ball to attack, and Yao Chong abandoned the pass to save, but Longhai had already reached the city, raised his foot and shot obliquely, and sent it into the empty goal. At the same time, he collided with Yao Chong, and both of them fell unconscious. Longhai woke up after a while, but Yao Chong was more seriously injured and had to leave the field, replaced by Min Yuehan. At the end of the first half, Donghua led 2-0.</p>
<p>Second Half: Changing the gate to fight again, Donghua replaced Huang Kehou with Chen Mingzhe, and Longhai changed to center forward. Hequn Tang Genfu rested temporarily, and Fang Mingkang came on the stage. Dong Qun's offensive was still strong, but Chen Mingzhe repeatedly missed opportunities and gained nothing. At 20 minutes, Mingzhe passed the ball wonderfully, and Longhai swept it across, Donghua then broke Hequn's goal three times. Two minutes later, Han Longbi committed a foul, and Zhang Ting took a free kick, shooting from a distance. Hequn pulled back a goal. Soon Liu Longxing headed the ball, just as Chen Mingzhe raised his foot, causing his nose to bleed and was injured and left the field. At 37 minutes, Sun Laojin shot, and Min Yuehan patted it into a corner kick. Youliang opened it, just right, and the "nephew" headed it in. After that, the battle situation became more relaxed, and at the end of the game, Donghua overcame his disciples 4-1.</p>

<h3 id="e142">Talking About Social Education Issues <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>— Yang Rubiong</p>
<p>Social education is gradually being forgotten by everyone! If it is not mentioned today, not only the general public, but even people in the education field may have forgotten it. I am wondering: will social education one day be excluded from the realm of education?</p>
<p>This is a major crisis facing social education, and it will inevitably hinder the development of the future of social education! Standing on the position of the nation and the country, standing on the perspective of advancing the entire education system, standing on the position of raising public intelligence, promoting democracy, and realizing constitutional government, shouldn't we raise this issue for discussion?</p>
<p>Social education is a type of educational undertaking, its history as long as society. Where there is society, there is social education, even earlier than the emergence of the school system. Those receiving education in schools are limited to children and youth, while the target of social education includes all people, regardless of gender or age. However, there are too few social education undertakings, and they are not taken seriously enough. Who still knows that social education is important? Who still recognizes the importance of social education undertakings and is willing to promote it? I once heard someone with high-level educational administrative responsibilities publicly say: all public education centers (Minzhong Jiaoyu Guan) across the country should be closed! I don't know what kind of view this is? However, this also proves that not only the general public does not recognize social education, but even people in the education field regard social education as something dispensable! Hearing such words is really infuriating. To develop social education in the future, I feel that the prerequisite is to make everyone have a clearer understanding of social education. In other words: to develop social education, we must start with psychological construction!</p>
<p>Elementary schools, middle schools, and universities have a consistent system and fixed practices. People in the education field consider them to be a matter of course, and the general public can also easily have a clear understanding. However, how should social education be explored? People in charge of education administration always seem to feel that it is not worthy of establishing a system, and they intentionally or unintentionally do not systematize it, forming a complex and chaotic situation, resulting in it being seen as something dispensable. I feel that to change the impression of social education in people's eyes, the most important thing is to systematize and organize it; where should social education institutions be established, and what work should social education institutions do, all must have clear regulations.</p>
<p>The target of social education is so large, the undertaking of social education is so complex, but the funding for social education is pitifully small. Everyone feels that social education can be done or not, so social education funding can naturally be more or less. More is certainly very good, but what does it matter if there is less? In fact, as early as 1929, the central government had already stipulated that "the social education funding of each province and city should account for 10% to 20% of the total education funding"; but how many provinces and cities have reached this standard now?</p>
<p>Education is a kind of relationship between people. The recipient must be willing to learn, and the educator must be good at teaching, so that this educational relationship can achieve the expected good results. Based on this fundamental understanding, we know that whether the teachers are qualified or not has a decisive effect on the quality of education. Elementary schools, middle schools, and universities all need good qualified teachers, which is universally recognized; why can social education be done by just casually finding someone to do it? However, many people's views are indeed like this, and they definitely believe that social education can be done by anyone. Looking at the current situation, there are too few schools in the country that specialize in training social education talents; apart from the National Social Education College and the Jiangsu Provincial Education College, it is impossible to find schools that train senior social education talents. As for schools that train intermediate social education talents, the Ministry of Education originally stipulated that each province and city should establish social education normal schools, but too few have been established. Everyone blames the local public education centers and libraries for not being well-run, and the people running them are not competent. Who can be blamed?</p>
<p>Five. Social Education Teaching Materials and Teaching Aids Issues</p>
<p>The teaching method of "empty talk" is already outdated. To strengthen teaching efficiency, we must try to use books, instruments, specimens, models, and even the latest movies and broadcasts. Each school should compile textbooks, which is a universally recognized and justified fact. However, should social education institutions not compile and print various appropriate teaching materials according to the needs of the public in all aspects of life? The educational administrative authorities are very serious and meticulous in editing and reviewing textbooks for all subjects at all levels of schools, which we approve of; however, we cannot praise the educational administrative authorities for not editing and reviewing various teaching materials needed by the public for social education institutions. With institutions and talents, if there are no teaching materials, or only some random materials are found temporarily, good results will not be achieved, and there is even the danger of errors!</p>
<p>Six. Social Education Achievement Assessment Issues</p>
<p>Whether an elementary school is run well or not can be answered by the performance of its students; whether a middle school or a university is run well or not can also be answered by their students' performance. If the students' performance is good, the general public will say that the school is run well and will support it in various ways. What can be used to show the quality of social education institutions? Everyone says that a certain social education institution is not doing well, because they cannot see the performance of its students. The students of a school are fixed and focused on learning, so it is naturally easy to check its quality; the targets of social education are so complex and unfixed, and they can only spend a small part of their time on education, so the results are naturally difficult to show. Therefore, the issue in the future is to first determine the standards for assessing the performance of social education institutions, and publicize them to the general public, so that everyone knows the standards for evaluating the quality of each social education institution. In this way, the people running them will know the goal of their efforts, and the public will have a fair evaluation. The above six points are my personal "unworthy words" for belly society education, and also my "alarming words" for social education. Readers will perhaps not think they are "alarming words to scare people", right? (October 31, 1946, at the Ministry of Education)</p>

<p>Chairman Chiang in Wuxi. 31st Wuxi News, Gao Wuhong</p>
<p>This news was confirmed by General Tang Enbo on the morning of the 31st and spread like wildfire. As expected, the Chairman's special train arrived at 12:20 amidst the anticipation of the crowd. After stopping, the Chairman, dressed in a solemn blue robe and black formal attire, holding a silver-gray soft hat in his right hand, and wearing black-patterned leather shoes and black silk socks, stepped off the train first. Following him was Madame Chiang, dressed in a royal blue suit, with a graceful and dignified demeanor. Next were Special Envoy Marshall and his wife, the publisher of "Life" magazine, Luce, and more than fifty of the Chairman's staff and attendants, who disembarked one after another. After the group slowly exited the station, the Chairman, amidst the cheers of the crowd, first boarded the "〇〇714" special car with Mrs. Marshall. Madame Chiang and Special Envoy Marshall boarded another blue sedan, and the staff followed in other cars. Led by Chen Daqing in a jeep, they passed through Wuqiao, Huishan, and followed the Xiyi Road straight to Xiaojishan. Along the way, they were warmly cheered by the public. The Chairman smiled in the car, waved his hat, and repeatedly said, "Thank you!"</p>
<p>Five-Hour Stay Stuns the City, Lake Tai Scenery Adds Infinite Glory</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang's sixtieth birthday is being celebrated throughout the world, with great celebrations held across the country to repay the Chairman's great achievements. On this day, the Chairman avoided the birthday celebrations and came to Wuxi to get half a day of rest and enjoy the scenic beauty of the lake and mountains that he had not seen for ten years, so that his birthday would be more peaceful and meaningful, occupying a beautiful and bright page in his glorious life history.</p>
<p>The Wuxi Command of the Jinghu Garrison Headquarters ordered the Wuxi County Government on October 30 to clean the streets, repair the roads, and tidy up the city. After receiving the order, the County Government immediately instructed the district chiefs of the urban area to work with the Military Police Bureau to thoroughly clean all streets and areas inside and outside the city and the train station, to be completed before dusk on the same day. At the same time, 600 civilian laborers were mobilized to repair the badly damaged lakeside avenue, starting in the morning. The paratrooper unit stationed in Wuxi also dispatched personnel to assist, to be completed that night. The military police were responsible for cracking down on street vendors, which was very tense and strict. On the morning of the same day, two planes landed successively at the newly built Wuxi Airport. The first one was unknown, and the second one was General Tang Enbo. From these signs, everyone speculated that the Chairman might come to Wuxi to celebrate his sixtieth birthday. The reporters had no intention of sitting in the editorial office writing稿 and went out to interview all night, but all parties kept their mouths shut and refused to reveal any information.</p>
<p>The "Pingxiang" Pleasure Boat Heads to Yuantouzhu</p>
<p>At 12:50, they arrived at Xiaojishan. The Chairman, arm in arm with Mrs. Marshall, and Special Envoy Marshall, arm in arm with Madame Chiang, disembarked and boarded the "Pingxiang" pleasure boat pre-docked by the lake. The Chairman sat briefly on the bow of the boat, then went ashore alone and stood on the shore, gazing at the distant scenery for a moment to broaden his mind, before slowly boarding the boat, and the boatmen untied the ropes and headed straight for Lake Tai.</p>
<p>When the Chairman's boat headed towards Yuantouzhu, it was surrounded by boats carrying staff on the left, right, and behind. Security was tight, and boats were prohibited from passing through. The "Minghu" gunboat patrolled back and forth on the lake in a semicircle. All the drivers and carriage drivers wore red ribbons on their chests for identification, which was considered thoughtful.</p>
<p>The front cabin of the "Pingxiang" pleasure boat had a long dining table, with a bouquet of red chrysanthemums in a white vase in the center. The windows were decorated with blue silk curtains, which complemented the white tablecloth. Ten minutes after the boat set sail, a lunch was set up in the cabin. All the dishes were prepared by Yingbinlou, and the menu was: assorted cold dishes, stir-fried large meat, braised winter bamboo shoots, winter mushrooms and bamboo shoots with tofu, squirrel mandarin fish, braised chicken cubes, chicken oil greens, crab roe shark fin, crispy whole duck, rose longevity peach, Yifu longevity noodles, hot pot (including four meat and four vegetable dishes, chicken, raw eggs, raw kidney slices, tofu, Chinese cabbage, vermicelli, spinach). The Chairman expressed his appreciation, and after the meal, he smiled and comfortably gazed at the blue waves and distant mountains, and said to his wife and the Marshalls, "To eat fish and crabs, you have to come to Wuxi."</p>
<p>A Short Rest at the Seventy-Two Peak Mountain Hall, Overlooking Lake Tai</p>
<p>During the meal, the Chairman frequently toasted with the guests. The Marshalls also repeatedly stood up to congratulate the Chairman and his wife. According to those close to the Chairman, the Chairman had not had such a hearty drink in several years. At about 2 o'clock, the guests were all slightly drunk and had Taiwan watermelon. The Chairman was very satisfied with the longevity cake presented by Tang Enbo and placed it on the dining table in the cabin. After Madame Chiang lit the sixteen longevity candles, the Chairman personally blew them all out in one breath, wishing longevity without end.</p>
<p>At 2:30, the boat arrived at Yuantouzhu. The Chairman and Mrs. Marshall took the lead, and the entire group disembarked and went ashore. Tourists stood respectfully on both sides of the road to welcome them. The Chairman warmly nodded in reply and climbed the steps with the guests to the Seventy-Two Peak Mountain Hall. Facing the lake and mountains, they sat for a short rest, drinking tea and overlooking Lake Tai, taking in the panoramic view. The Chairman smiled and asked Special Envoy Marshall, "How is the scenery here?" "Wherever I have been with your Excellency, the scenery is beautiful." This was Marshall's reply.</p>
<p>After lingering on the mountain for about thirty minutes, they went down the mountain together. The Chairman was very happy and said to General Tang Enbo, "The scenery of Yuantouzhu is better than that of the West Lake!" Yes, this newspaper's dispatch also made a brief comparison between the West Lake and Lake Tai: "One is a gentle girl, and the other is a handsome hero." (See page 7 of this newspaper on June 2) After being evaluated by the Chairman, it is even more valuable tenfold. At the edge of Yuantouzhu, they sat on the ground, listening to the lake water hitting the rocks, and all worldly thoughts were washed away. The Chairman repeatedly inquired about the people's livelihood, aquatic products, and transportation problems of Lake Tai. Mrs. Marshall liked the maple leaves in the mountains and instructed her attendants to take a large amount back as a souvenir.</p>
<p>The Chairman's group said goodbye to Yuantouzhu at 4:15. At that time, the Wuxi Small Education Association was having a dinner at Yuantouzhu. After hearing the news, they led the elementary school students to line up and send them off respectfully, shouting, "Long live Chairman Chiang!" The Chairman repeatedly nodded and waved his left hand. After getting into the car, they exited Hengyun Park, entered the west gate along the Huanhu Avenue, passed through Fuxing Road, Gongyuan Road, and Yuantong Road, and exited Guangfu Gate to inspect the entire city of Wuxi for a week. Along the way, the people lined the streets to welcome them, and the sound of firecrackers and cheers resounded through the clouds. The atmosphere was enthusiastic and unprecedented, showing the depth of the people's respect and love for the Chairman. When they arrived at the station, a silver single-winged plane circled overhead, distributing leaflets congratulating the Chairman on his birthday. The people scrambled to grab and read them.</p>
<p>The Chairman's special train started at 5:30 amidst the cheers of the people. The cheers were thunderous. The Chairman stood up from the car and waved his hand at the car door, smiling and repeatedly saying, "Good, good, good! Thank you!" The crowd shouted again, "Long live Chairman!" and watched the special train gradually disappear into the twilight.</p>
<p>Note: This is the third time Chairman Chiang has visited Wuxi. The first time was after the completion of the Northern Expedition in 1929, and the second time was in 1936. All three times were with his wife. Every time Chairman Chiang comes to Wuxi, the times and environment have undergone tremendous changes. These three visits to Wuxi have divided three different periods in Chinese history, which also represent three stages of the Chairman's struggle.</p>
<p>The Concession Recently Formally Recovered - A Sketch of Shameen, Guangzhou</p>
<p>October 29, Guangzhou Air Mail, Special Correspondent Liang Feng of this newspaper</p>
<p>Just at the end of this October, the Guangzhou City authorities issued a public announcement that the only concession in Guangzhou, Shameen, has been formally recovered. This news has greatly excited the people of Guangzhou, because although Shameen is not a large place, it was designated as a British and French concession in the late Qing Dynasty (1859 AD) due to unequal treaties. Later, our government spent more than twenty years working to abolish the unequal treaties. Today, with the consent of our friendly countries, under the treaty that abolished extraterritorial rights and other privileges in China, the jurisdiction of this place has been returned to our hands. How can this not excite us? And this small piece of land naturally has its historical value.</p>
<p>The Most Beautiful Corner</p>
<p>If we are coming to Guangzhou by waterway, when we reach the edge of the Guangzhou city area, we will first find a small island with dense shade and elegant scenery in the southwest corner. This is the most beautiful corner of Guangzhou - Shameen. This place has a total area of fifty-five acres and four square li, floating on the Pearl River. A small tributary of the Pearl River separates it from the city area, and it is connected to the city area by two bridges, east and west. Since the place was designated as a British and French concession eighty years ago (of which the British occupied forty-six acres and the French occupied nine acres), the British and French people used the natural environment of being surrounded by water, plus artificial construction, to make it a beautiful place. In this area, there are all magnificent and exquisite foreign houses. The embankment around the island is full of towering ancient trees, which are contrasted by stretches of green lawns, enhancing the elegant atmosphere of this area. Whenever it is morning or dusk, strolling along the embankment and looking at the sails of the Pearl River going up and down is even more enjoyable. Therefore, Shameen is indeed an ideal park.</p>
<p>Since the environment there is beautiful and it is a concession, it has always been a place where foreigners gather. Consulates of various countries stationed in Guangdong are located there, and the rest are foreign firms and shops. Although it is a Chinese territory, there are not only no Chinese residences inside, but even if Chinese people want to enter, they cannot pass without being questioned several times by the red-turbaned guards guarding the bridgehead. This small river, less than four zhang wide, separates Guangzhou and Shameen into two worlds. Guangzhou citizens can only look across the river and imagine the mystery hidden inside Shameen. I am afraid that many people who have lived in Guangzhou for a lifetime have never been to Shameen! Therefore, for decades, Shameen has been called a "special zone" or a "forbidden zone" area, which is not an exaggeration at all.</p>
<p>No Longer a Special Zone</p>
<p>It was because of this "special zone" that Guangzhou had the "June 23" massacre in 1925. Because in May of that year, Shanghai citizens protested against the Japanese纱厂 shooting Gu Zhenghong, and the parade and demonstration were shot and killed by the concession police, resulting in the "May 30" massacre. When the news reached Guangzhou, the citizens were extremely indignant, so on June 23 of the same year, all middle and elementary school students and community members in the city demonstrated and paraded. When they passed through Sha-Er (沙而, a place name) on the opposite bank of Shameen, they were shot by machine guns by the British and French garrison stationed in Shameen. Blood and flesh flew everywhere, and corpses were strewn about, making a remote and long Sha-Er stained with blood. The tragic scene was unbearable to witness. At that time, I, the reporter, also participated in the ranks, so the impression was particularly profound. Later, in order to commemorate the citizens who died in this disaster, the municipal government changed Sha-Er to "June 23rd" Road, and erected a stone tablet at the north end of the West Bridge connecting Shameen and Sha-Er, with the four characters "Never Forget This Day" inscribed on it. This stone tablet still stands there for people to pay their respects. The Dao incident is now just a historical relic!</p>
<p>The current Shameen is certainly no longer a "special zone" or a "forbidden zone"! Since the Japanese army surrendered, Shameen has been taken back by our government along with other recovered areas, directly from the hands of the enemy and puppets. When I, the reporter, returned to Guangzhou after the restoration, the first thing I felt was different from before was the establishment of the Shameen Branch of the Guangzhou City Police Bureau. At the same time, standing at the east and west bridges were no longer red-turbaned people wearing "crowns," but our police officers wearing Qing Tian Bai Ri (Blue Sky with a White Sun) cap badges. Naturally, there are fewer "foreign flavors" in the Shameen area, but its scenery remains the same, and everything remains the same. There is the splendid and magnificent Victory Building, which houses restaurants, hotels, and dance halls, which is the most ideal place for high-ranking officials and dignitaries to entertain distinguished guests. There is also the Recreation Club run by the provincial government, which also has dining rooms, ballrooms, and swimming pools. The municipal government's tennis court and the Youth League's youth swimming pool are also there. When the New First Army was stationed in Guangdong last year, Sun Liren's headquarters was also located in Shameen. Currently, the important agencies there are: the South China Naval Headquarters, the Enemy and Puppet Property Disposal Bureau, the "United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration" office, the "Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration" Guangdong Branch, the "China Electric Corporation" and the "China Manufacturing Corporation" offices, etc. In addition, there are the consulates of the United States, Britain, France, Portugal, Denmark, Switzerland, Norway, and other countries stationed in Guangdong, and some foreign firms that have returned to resume business. The rest of the magnificent foreign houses have been occupied by the mansions of our high-ranking officials and dignitaries. According to statistics from the Shameen Police Branch, there are more than two hundred households in the Shameen area, with a total population of more than three thousand, of which only four or five hundred are foreigners.</p>
<p>Indeed, the recovery of Shameen is enough to excite us. There are no more concessions in the country! What remains are probably only Hong Kong, Kowloon, and Macau! We hope that in the near future, we will be able to receive even more exciting news, which is that our friendly countries can respect each other's friendship and return the sovereignty of these remaining places to us. This is probably not an extravagant hope!</p>
<p>Weekly Forum: Promoting Our Country's Peaceful Education! Zhou Shang</p>
<p>After the Paris Peace Conference closed, the United Nations General Assembly will be held, and the Second United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Conference will also open in Paris. According to reports, our country's representatives decided to depart at the beginning of this month. We hope that this international cultural and educational conference can truly lay the foundation for world peace. As the organization's charter declaration says, "Peace based solely on intergovernmental political and economic consultations cannot achieve the consistent, permanent, and sincere maintenance of all the people of the world." They have realized that the power of education and culture is not enough to lay the foundation for true world peace. Our country has a magic weapon to achieve permanent world peace. As long as this magic weapon is thoroughly understood by all mankind, the world will not be difficult to achieve great harmony, and it will not be difficult to achieve peace. It is hoped that this time our country's representatives can realize this preliminary mission.</p>
<p>Human wars originate from conflicts of ideas. This war was a conflict between democratic ideology and fascist ideology. The united democratic countries have won victory, and the ideal of world peace has just opened the first page. Even though we have charter declarations and other peace guarantees, we must see if various international conferences can succeed in whether the ideals revealed during the war can be implemented after the war.</p>
<p>The aggression of the fascists has solidified into grasping at the moon in the water, but the construction of a beautiful and happy peaceful world should be as much effort as the pursuit of war victory. There has been enough bloodshed this time, and the next generation should not be allowed to bleed a second time. Let this war be the last war of mankind! The Treaty of Versailles is a lesson from the past. At that time, Germany after defeat was like a pitiful insect with its limbs cut off, but national education was completely free. Germany, with its empty national power, invested heavily in national education. Unfortunately, the education they invested in was the implementation of Nietzsche's superman violent ideology education, which eventually created human vexation and mutual slaughter, turning the civilized crystallization of human efforts into cannon fodder.</p>
<p>Why is the power of education so great? Because education is to cultivate thought, and thought is the precursor of behavior, and it can also be said that thought is behavior. We pray for a peaceful world, and we should first use education to cultivate human peaceful thought. "Cows drink water to become milk, and snakes drink water to become poison." Education is like water. If used properly, it becomes a tonic. If used improperly, it becomes a toxin. Hegemonic countries use education as a tool of aggression, while Wangdao (benevolent rule) countries use education as a sharp tool to sow the seeds of peace. In order to realize permanent world peace, we should promote world peace through peace education. Germany and Japan are already undergoing re-education, and their spirit should be able to be disarmed. The impeccable style of the United Nations itself is the highest and most effective spirit of re-education.</p>
<p>War is a metabolic whip that whips politicians to change, educators to change, education to change, and the world to change. President Truman talked about the importance of international cultural and educational organizations at the White House on September 25, and said, "If our country does not have understanding, we will have no peace; if we do not have education, we will have no peace." Professor Dai Lao of the Illinois Institute of Technology in the United States suggested that the old site of the League of Nations be changed to a world university as a basis for transforming psychology and maintaining peace. In mid-September, a world education organization was established in New York's Andico City, with representatives from 25 countries representing millions of teachers. Most of the two-house meeting was spent discussing how to promote international peace through education. The "International Conference on New Education Research" held in Australia also focused on future world peace.</p>
<p>In the past, world education, except for China, did not escape three factions: (1) Democratic education, (2) Fascist education, (3) Socialist education. The first type falls into individual pragmatism, the second type is dialectical idealism, and the third type is dialectical materialism. Each has its own shortcomings, which created a world of utilitarian aggression and struggle. Only the Three People's Principles of Education is truly democratic education and can create true world peace. It contains the comprehensive nature of the educational philosophy of the three schools of democracy, fascism, and socialism. It has a selective function, promoting its strengths and discarding its weaknesses. The Principle of People's Livelihood is socialism, which is Datongism (the Great Unity), and nationalism is national ideology, not statism. The Principle of People's Rights opposes Locke and Rousseau's "natural rights" and demands true equality.</p>
<p>The Three People's Principles of Education is a continuation of Chinese traditional education. However, Wangdao education is peaceful education, which is Zhishan (Utmost Good) education. The whole world should adopt the spirit of Chinese education, and the world can only be permanently peaceful. The spirit of Chinese traditional education is "emphasis on morality." With the rise of the Han Dynasty, emphasis on morality became a definite education policy. Confucius' cultivation of self, family, governance of the country, and pacification of the world are all consistent. Lao Tzu also said, "Cultivate it in yourself, and its virtue is true; cultivate it in your family, and its virtue is surplus; cultivate it in your village, and its virtue is long; cultivate it in your state, and its virtue is abundant; cultivate it in the world, and its virtue is good." They all proposed "taking the world as a family and China as one person."</p>
<p>Confucius spoke of benevolence, and Lao Tzu spoke of compassion, and the Chinese family can be called a "benevolence and compassion cultivation field," which is lacking in Westerners. Westerners go from nature to man, while Chinese go from man to nature. The West focuses on conquering nature, and the object is power, and social life is struggle. China focuses on regulating life, and the object is vitality, and social life is the coexistence of all things. In the West, material development is already developed, but human relations are still imperfect. In China, although material life is poor, human relations still feel harmonious. These are all the results of traditional education, and this kind of education is our magic weapon.</p>
<p>The purpose of the Three People's Principles of Education is actually equivalent to the outline of "The Way of Great Learning...rests in resting in the Utmost Good" mentioned in the Great Learning. Mental and material, both are taken care of, things and I are equally important, not only for the present, but also for the future, individuals have freedom, groups have freedom, for others and for oneself, without erasing the nation-state, while advocating world Datong (Great Unity). If this kind of Zhishan (Utmost Good) education, which is "applicable to the four seas," is promoted to the world, why worry that the world will not have permanent peace?</p>
<p>China has been called the land of etiquette and righteousness since ancient times. Individuals value no contention, and politics also value moral transformation. The prosperity of ritual music and the beauty of yielding are originally internal affairs. A government that yields virtue will definitely be anti-aggressive and uphold peace in its foreign policy. The Yao Dian of the Book of Documents says "harmonize all nations," and Gu Ming says "harmonize the world." Ancient guest rituals were full of a solemn and peaceful atmosphere. This is the manifestation of whether the country is educated.</p>
<p>Two months ago, the New York Times Magazine published an article by Boli Tuo, who is familiar with Chinese culture and education, entitled "World Peace and Chinese Philosophy." He believed that Chinese social and political philosophy is based on obligations rather than rights. He also said that independent countries must recognize their obligations to other countries and regard themselves as members of the entire family in order to get along well; countries with strong power must understand that they have the responsibility to use this power to promote the welfare of mankind in order to prevent aggression. He recognizes that this ideal can be found in Chinese philosophy, because Chinese philosophy is all about studying how humans can get along well. He also said that Confucius' ideal world is beautiful, and only by cultivating a sense of responsibility and applying it to the international aspect can a truly international society be realized.</p>
<p>People have already seen our magic weapon for maintaining world peace. We hope that the representatives this time should bring a set of great Chinese principles to translate into various languages and widely publicize, especially the theoretical system of the Three People's Principles of Education. We must make a good effort to report to the world and make them accept and welcome our culture and education as the yeast of peace. We must also propose the organization of international education organizations as the center of the world security mechanism, implement China's Wangdao (benevolent rule) peaceful education, in order to seek world peace.</p>
<p>Random Notes on the Paris Peace Conference</p>
<p>The Film is 30,000 Meters Long, and the Daily Paper Consumption is 150 Tons</p>
<p>October 20 Air Mail, Hong Fu Sent from Paris</p>
<p>The Second Paris Peace Conference began on July 27, 1946, and ended on October 15 of the same year. The grand occasion was unprecedented, as can be seen from the statistical figures:</p>
<p>(1) Expenses: The total expenditure was 136 trillion and 25 million francs, which is equivalent to about 3,725 trillion Chinese currency, all borne by the French government alone.</p>
<p>(2) Consumption: The conference had 158 vehicles. The monthly consumption of gasoline was about 125,000 liters. The five countries of the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, France, and China had the most vehicles, all reaching six. During the conference period, in addition to the Ministry of Propaganda, there was a large-scale reception center for foreign journalists in the "Journalist Hall" (according to the journalist, the third wife of Louis XIV was the writer and her name, its international intelligence agency stationed in the Luxembourg Palace conference venue was divided into four shares:</p>
<p>(A) News: There were 2,520 journalists from various countries attending the conference, and 20,000 tourists. A total of 1,038 journalist entrance permits were issued. The large hall (Hemi-cycle) on the third floor of the semi-circular hall for the conference was specially set up for journalists with 292 seats, occupying three boxes. In addition, 292 long-term seat tickets were issued, and about 2,000 short-term seat tickets valid for one day or one week were issued. The audience seats in the various committees of the various sub-collections were 20 people, and the few were five or six people. About 600 sub-hall seat tickets were issued.</p>
<p>Two postal offices were set up throughout the venue. The journalist sent out a total of 500,000 letters, postcards, printed matter, etc., including 50,000 airmail letters. There were 200,000 letters sent to journalists from various places. There were 2,000 vacuum express letters in Paris. The telegrams totaled 13,000 domestic and foreign pieces, with nearly 5 million words. The telephone calls totaled approximately 320,000 times in the local port and international ports.</p>
<p>(B) Compilation of archives and issuance of documents. The minutes of the meeting and other 13,500 documents were printed by 15 Reneotype machines, with the strength of 35 people, day and night, and printed in English, French and Soviet languages in turn. The daily paper consumption was 2 tons in peacetime, and 5 tons in busy times, for a total of 150 tons of paper.</p>
<p>(C) Wireless radio broadcasting and television. There were 180 telephones installed in the venue, with a total length of 36 kilometers of wire, and 66 amplifiers for receiving and broadcasting books, 8 film-making machines for recording sound on phonograph discs, and 8 testers for checking after the film was completed. There were 20 microc-phones placed next to the speakers' seats to transmit and record the 47 conferences, 114 committees, and 36 interviews. Either transmit and record, or record first and then transmit, or send to London by telephone first, and then send by shortwave electricity from them. A total of 428 hours were used for wireless work.</p>
<p>(D) Photography. Each country could enter the venue for photography and projection with a quota of 20 journalists, with the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, and France each occupying four places, and the remaining 17 countries sharing the rest. The restrictions on painters were slightly looser. The film made by the General Assembly was 30,000 meters long, or 30 kilometers. It was based on two sets of electric motors with a current intensity of 600 amperes, and ten spot lights with very strong light were working at the same time. The photography for each important person was limited to ten minutes. As for the television screen attached to the radio receiver, which can be used by journalists to watch and listen at the same time, there are three. At this time, although the journalist is far away from the venue, he can secretly observe the sound, appearance, and smile of each important person's speech in the small shrine to his heart's content.</p>

<h3 id="e145">The Development of China's Textile Industry <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>— Deng Qiu Shao</p>
<p>The textile industry occupies the most important position in China's industries, employing over 200,000 workers and involving over 30 billion in capital. Before the war, the nation relied on it for over 50 million yuan in taxes. Therefore, the textile industry is related to the rise and fall of the entire national economy and is also a pioneer in the modernization of Chinese industry. Regarding this important industry, we hope to understand the path the Chinese textile industry should take in the future by reviewing past situations.</p>
<p>The establishment of textile factories in China began with Li Hongzhang's establishment of the Shanghai Foreign Cloth Bureau. After this, textile factories continued to be established. However, after the Opium War and the Sino-Japanese War, foreign merchants obtained the right to establish factories in treaty ports, resulting in a sudden increase in foreign-owned yarn factories in China. By the 34th year of the Guangxu reign, although there were 52 yarn factories in China, Japanese merchants owned 8 of them, British merchants 6, German merchants 2, and Sino-foreign joint ventures 2. It was not until the outbreak of the European War in August of the 3rd year of the Republic of China that the foundation for this national industry was laid. During the war, countries were focused on their own survival and had no time to attend to the development of industry and commerce. Even the United Kingdom, which held the reins of the textile industry, also tried to reduce workers, resulting in a lack of production and a sharp decrease in exports. As a result, the market price of textiles rose day by day. Therefore, at that time, Chinese textile factories were all extremely profitable, accumulating thick profits. Those with assets also saw the potential for profit and invested in the textile industry, resulting in a sudden emergence of new factories like bamboo shoots after rain, creating a new situation in China's textile industry. By the end of the 11th year of the Republic of China, the total number of spindles in the country had increased dramatically from 590,000 to 2 million, and the number of textile factories had increased by 17. This was the most remarkable page in Chinese industrial history.</p>
<p>After the 12th year of the Republic of China, there was no special development in China's textile industry. At that time, politics were not on the right track, warlords were dividing the country, and there were years of civil war without construction. Transportation was inconvenient, and many factories were reorganized or closed due to poor business. However, many new factories were added during this period. However, due to the above reasons, the textile industry could not be fully developed.</p>
<p>Until the September 18th Incident in the 20th year of the Republic of China, Japan invaded the three northeastern provinces by force. The following year, the January 28th War occurred in Shanghai (Note 1), China's Lancashire. These two wars gave the Chinese people the most painful scars and at the same time gave the textile industry the most severe blow. At that time, factories destroyed by the war and forced to shut down accounted for one-fifth of the country, and the losses suffered could not be recovered in a short period of time. Moreover, after the three northeastern provinces were occupied by Japanese forces, our country's textile exports to the Northeast (accounting for over 31% of the country) gradually decreased to complete cessation of sales. In order to expand its political power, Japan strengthened its control over the North China market. Japanese merchants disregarded costs and competed by lowering prices, making it even more difficult for Chinese merchants, and sales shortened.</p>
<p>The decrease in sales and the drop in yarn prices almost brought our textile industry to complete defeat. Although the factories struggled repeatedly, reducing workers, cutting salaries, and increasing workloads, the results were still difficult to maintain. By June of the 23rd year, according to statistics from the National Textile Industry Federation, as many as 12 textile factories across the country had completely shut down. In addition, although the factories tried to maintain the status quo, they all reduced their business scope.</p>
<p>The prosperity of a country's industry and commerce is closely related to politics. In the 25th year of the Republic of China, China's national power was still immersed in a hot and deteriorating state, and domestic enterprises also faced an unprecedented crisis. Therefore, the textile industry still could not escape the unfortunate fate of recession. However, there was still a very special phenomenon in the Chinese textile industry during this period of decline, that is, from the 22nd year of the Republic of China, the number of yarn spindles in the country increased year by year. However, according to the working conditions, the increase in shutdowns and salary reductions was enough to show that the increase in the number of spindles was an abnormal phenomenon.</p>
<p>Until the second half of the 25th year of the Republic of China, the implementation of the legal currency policy and the domestic transportation were more developed than before, and because of the rural economic recovery, the people's purchasing power increased, the textile industry suddenly picked up. Sales of textiles were so strong that the factory inventory sold out. Although the factories opened day and night, there was still a situation of supply exceeding demand, and yarn prices soared, and the factories earned huge profits. Therefore, the factories that had previously shut down and closed seized the opportunity to resume work in succession, and the planned new factories and yarn factories expanded the yarn spindles. It is estimated that in the six months of that year, the number of new yarn spindles reached more than 150,000, which was another golden age for the textile industry.</p>
<p>However, not long after the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the textile industry fell into a critical state again. Moreover, between the first half of the 26th year, what is worth mentioning is that the textile industry in Tianjin and Qingdao almost fell into the hands of the Japanese, and the money spindles accounted for 70% of the land. Therefore, Chinese merchants were precarious, while Japanese merchants were booming.</p>
<p>During the war, the textile factories suffered heavy losses. Later, after the occupied areas were forced to buy cotton cloth by the enemy and puppets, the factories almost completely stopped working and closed down. The factories that moved back to the inland were also unable to maintain full operation due to the isolation of transportation and the inconvenience of raw material transportation. However, after the victory, the enemy and puppet textile factories were taken over by our country. The Japanese economy in China for more than 30 years was changed to national management, which is truly an unprecedented event in the history of China's textile industry. Moreover, due to the general lack of domestic textiles after the war, and the high price of yarn and low price of cotton, the textile factories were actively seeking to revive. Therefore, the resumption of work in the textile industry in various places was relatively rapid. By the end of June this year, the average rate of resuming work had reached 60-80%. However, after the foreign exchange adjustment last month, the market price of textile raw materials rose sharply, the wages of workers increased endlessly, and the burden of interest became heavier. The degree of recovery of the Japanese textile industry surpassed our country. If this continues, it is difficult to predict whether the textile industry will remain unchanged for a long time.</p>
<p>The above is a brief overview of the development of China's textile industry in the past 35 years. In this, we can also see a clue to the development of the textile industry in the past. However, the author's knowledge is shallow, and there are many omissions, and the errors in understanding are inevitable. I hope that celebrities in this field will teach me.</p>
<h3 id="e146">Improving China's Silk Industry <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>— Cai Yaochun</p>
<p>Silk originated in our country and is a major agricultural byproduct and a major commodity for foreign trade. The production areas are all over the country, and the profits benefit the people. Its prosperity and decline are also sufficient to influence the prosperity and decline of our national economy. However, the people of our country have always valued conservatism, so that for thousands of years, there has been no improvement in breeding and reeling. They have remained stagnant and have been overtaken by countries such as England and Italy. In order to regain rights and revive the silk industry and compete with European and American countries, reform must be carried out. I will now describe the opinions I have learned as follows, and I hope that experts will give me some advice:</p>
<p>A. Production Technology</p>
<p>A. Instilling knowledge of silkworm breeding, seed selection, and mulberry cultivation to farmers.</p>
<p>The work of popularizing education cannot be completed in a short period of time, and improving the silk industry is an urgent matter. In order to achieve the above-mentioned objectives at the current stage, it is necessary to temporarily adopt indirect methods, that is, the government should establish silkworm and mulberry guidance centers in silk producing areas, actively send personnel to guide farmers in scientific methods of silkworm breeding, and conduct chemical tests and statistics at any time to strictly crack down on inferior species. For mulberry cultivation, we should teach them how to fertilize, how to rotate pruning, and how to prevent pests, so that the quality of mulberry can be improved, and the quality of silk will naturally be improved accordingly.</p>
<p>B. Replenishing Silk Factory Capital</p>
<p>This kind of cause containing national characteristics is best state-owned, otherwise the silk factory must be adequately capitalized. Silk factories with sufficient capital can pay attention to the improvement of reeling and technology, such as employing professional talents and purchasing new machines. The method is that the government should conduct registration and stipulate the minimum capital amount of silk factories. Those with insufficient capital are not allowed to start work. The government purchases its assets at a fair price, improves them, and then operates them with state funds. In this way, the drawbacks of rough manufacturing can be eliminated, and the revival of the silk industry can be expected.</p>
<p>C. Specialized Talents Should be Cultivated in Large Quantities</p>
<p>The government should establish specialized schools in various places, hire professors with extensive knowledge and rich experience, engage in training specialized talents, instill specialized knowledge, and provide more opportunities for practice. Afterwards, the reasons for the failure of the Chinese silk industry over the years and the methods of improvement should be carefully studied, so that students can make contributions to the country after graduation, otherwise they will only become tools for capitalists to exploit workers.</p>
<p>B. Production Organization</p>
<p>A. The Government Should Implement Control</p>
<p>In recent years, the industries of various countries in the world have been controlled and subsidized by the government. The prosperity and decline of industry is related to the foundation of a country. How can it be allowed to rise and fall? China's industry is immature. To compete with European and American countries, the government should provide full protection and control. How can the lessons of the past be ignored? Therefore, in the future, the government should set up institutions in various production areas to control the price of silkworm cocoons and the collection of cocoons, and then sell them to silk factories at a fair price. The internal affairs of silk factories should also be supervised and guided by government agencies. The products must be strictly inspected and divided into grades, and the prices of each grade must be uniform. If this can be done, the production situation in various parts of the country will gradually become regularized, and the authorities will easily detect various shortcomings and gradually improve them.</p>
<p>B. Establishment of Direct Sales Agency</p>
<p>In order to avoid the exploitation of profits by indirect sales merchants, general agencies should be set up in major ports in the country to register the products, types, and inventory of each factory. On the one hand, branch agencies should be set up in various silk sales countries to investigate the silk sales situation, and to be familiar with the supply situation of the silk market in various countries, and achieve the effect of "knowing yourself and your enemy, you will never be defeated."</p>
<p>C. Financial Institutions Should Cooperate Closely with Farmers and Silk Merchants</p>
<p>In recent years, the world economy has been extremely empty, and the United States and other countries have taken the opportunity to invade China. Under the dual pressure, the Chinese countryside is on the verge of bankruptcy, and farmers are extremely poor. Where do they get the capital to breed silkworms in large quantities? Therefore, in recent years, China's silk production has increased sharply, and various silk factories have also failed year after year. The capital is stretched, and they have failed to produce in large quantities. The financial community in our country should provide practical assistance to this kind of difficulty. During the spring and autumn silkworm flooding, low-interest loans should be provided to farmers, using the produced silkworm cocoons as collateral. Although the time is only one month, the farmers will benefit greatly. On the one hand, when silk is selling well, financial institutions provide large amounts of loans to silk factories so that they can actively produce and avoid missing the opportunity.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned points are all urgent matters. If we work hard in time and improve step by step, it will not be difficult for the Chinese silk industry, which has long been at the top of the world, to once again dominate the world.</p>

<p>In the management of industry, waiting is a very important element of success. The waiting mentioned here is not shrinking back and waiting for time, but working hard and moving forward on weekdays, and when the opportunity comes, seize the opportunity and do not give up easily.</p>
<p>When the environment is unfavorable, you should wait, waiting for the environment to improve.</p>
<p>But being able to wait is not easy, it must have a sustaining power, this sustaining power, financial support, etc. are very important, but can be produced by the perseverance of not being afraid of difficulties.</p>
<h3 id="e148">Introduction to Business Administration <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Baiyi</p>
<p>Employee Psychology</p>
<p>Foreword</p>
<p>In the operation of an enterprise, most people think that the most difficult thing to solve is personnel problems. Many good businesses have opinions due to personnel problems, making it impossible to proceed, and even going on the path of ending or dissolving.</p>
<p>This kind of situation often refers to the personnel problems between senior staff. In places where labor is employed, then the problems of labor are also very difficult to solve.</p>
<p>Many people do not know what is called scientific management and what is the difference between scientific management and business administration. This can be simply explained. The so-called scientific management is that the implementation of business administration must be done according to scientific methods. For example, dealing with daily affairs has always been done verbally without records, which is unscientific. According to the principles of scientific management, there should be records.</p>
<p>But this is scientific management in a narrow sense. The great goal of scientific management is to achieve the maximum production and the highest profit with the least amount of expenses and labor. After the January 28th Shanghai War, the printing factory and translation bureau of the Commercial Press were destroyed by artillery fire. At that time, it was a very difficult period, but Mr. Wang Yunwu, the general manager of the library, used twelve hours of work every day to do his best to plan the progress of various affairs. Therefore, in less than a year, the production power was several times higher than before January 28th. This is the result of using scientific management methods. He values time very much. Therefore, he said that it only takes five minutes for a person to eat. Many of his subordinates ridiculed him that this was impossible. In fact, although this is a very simple example, it can be used in the handling of affairs. If a person can handle affairs perfectly, that is the first step. The second step is to reduce the time required. If what originally took ten minutes can be done in five minutes, then can't many more things be done in a day? Therefore, scientific management has a great principle, that is, to reduce all unnecessary waste.</p>
<p>Scientific management also has a prerequisite, that is, on the one hand, it must generate extremely abundant profits, and on the other hand, it must also promote the welfare of workers, because a business cannot prosper sustainably if it only thinks from the perspective of the capitalists. It is necessary to improve the lives of workers, so that they can work stably, so that they can have a healthy body and a healthy mind, and produce excellent work.</p>
<p>In many great factories abroad, a town has been built, and the workers all live in it. Their lives are very stable, and they also use methods such as consumer cooperatives to enjoy lower prices for their daily necessities because of group purchases. They have public canteens, even sports grounds, cinemas, compulsory schools, and libraries, so that all workers can live and work in peace and contentment, and are unwilling and do not need to leave that lovely town to seek entertainment outside. They live in this environment, naturally, can create a good atmosphere. In this case, career and family can truly be said to be united.</p>
<p>However, in China, because the production industry has not developed to a considerable time, it is not yet possible to achieve that level of perfection, but if there are talents in business administration and the methods of business administration are studied (we temporarily call it business administration, and do not bring up the big hat of scientific management, because we still focus on reality), progress is not a problem.</p>
<p>In the past, when operating an enterprise, I only knew to buy raw materials at the lowest price, engage in production, sell at a corresponding price and obtain a corresponding profit, and did not pay much attention to the problems of labor.</p>
<p>But the times are progressing, so more attention should be paid to labor problems than before, so employing labor requires the use of the principles of psychology. The purpose of this work is to know whether the psychology of the labor side is healthy and whether it can meet the needs of the work.</p>
<p>In the past, there was no testing when employing labor, so there was often an uneven phenomenon. If testing is carried out and then training is given, then the working level of workers can be standardized, which has a great relationship with the progress of work and production. At the same time, this method is not only suitable for labor, even for staff, it can also be applied, so we can collectively call it employee psychology.</p>

<p>It is now well known that vitamins are essential nutrients for everyone every day, but there are some substances in the human body that cannot be produced internally and must be digested and then entered into the body. Amino acids (Amino Acid) are one of these precious substances.</p>
<p>According to medical research, there are more than 20 kinds of amino acids, but there are 10 main ones. These 10 kinds of amino acids cannot be missing one. If an appropriate amount of vitamins and minerals are added, it can become the most nourishing type of supplement.</p>
<h3 id="e150">A Desolate Conversation About West Lake in Late Autumn <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>— Zhao Qingge</p>
<p>Traveling is inherently a joyful thing, and I, in my life, love traveling the most. But this time, I feel no joy at all. For many days, the atmosphere from all sides has been so oppressive that it suffocates me. Carrying a heavy heart, I reluctantly accompanied a few friends to Hangzhou. Although this is a scenic area of ​​green mountains and clear waters, my mood has not eased in the slightest because of it. When I threw myself into the embrace of West Lake, the joy of a long-awaited reunion instantly turned into a wisp of smoke, a wisp of smoke containing the vicissitudes of thousands of affairs. Thus, I shed a few sentimental tears!</p>
<p>In the autumn of my twenty-third year, for the sake of graduation sketching, I came to Hangzhou for the first time as a student with an excited mood. At that time, I and many students from the art school lived in the Huizhong Hotel on Huanhu Road. I spent all day carrying an oil painting box sketching everywhere. What made me linger the most was the Su Xiaoxiao Tomb Pavilion at the head of Xiling Bridge and the Manju burial mound in front of the Release Crane Pavilion under Gushan Mountain. Therefore, I painted two commemorative paintings. One was "Moon over Xiling Bridge." The scene, I can still vaguely remember, was a tranquil lake surface with a stone bridge with a semi-circular hole spanning it. At the corner of the bridge, the Su Xiaoxiao Tomb Pavilion was desolate, accompanied by a weeping willow, with a cold moon hanging on the willow tip. The other was "The Poetic Soul of Gushan." The scene seemed to focus on Manju's grave, on which stood a clay white crane. Gushan embraced the cemetery where the poet was buried, and a corner of Feng Xiaoqing's Tomb Pavilion reduced much of Manju's loneliness. Poetic souls accompanied poetic souls, and West Lake fostered their poetic inspiration on the side. These two paintings can be considered my quite satisfactory works, but unfortunately, they were preserved until the war broke out and were finally destroyed in the flames of war. Because I read a lot of poems and articles about Su Xiaoxiao when I was a child, I feel great pity for her. Especially Manju, I have read many of her novels and letters, and I deeply admire and sympathize with her thoughts, character, and life experiences. Often at dusk, I would lie alone in front of his grave, indulging in all kinds of boundless reveries. Sometimes I would bring a bamboo flute and sit on his grave, playing it quietly. I once naively hoped that I could use this secluded music to awaken his slumber and bring his poetic soul back to this world again! I mourned him and missed him so sincerely. At that time, I stayed in Hangzhou for more than a week. In addition to visiting some scenic spots on the lake, I also went to Lingyin, Taoguang, Tianzhu, Nine Streams and Eighteen Gullies, and Hupao. I also went to Qiantang and painted a "Shadow of Qiantang Pagoda." The scene was Qiantang River and Liuhe Pagoda. (This painting was selected by the school as my graduation work.) But among all the scenic spots I visited, I still prefer and miss Xiling Bridge and Gushan Mountain.</p>
<p>The second time I came to Hangzhou was in the autumn of my twenty-fifth year with Wen Yidao. My mood was leisurely. We stayed at the Die Lai Hotel at the head of Xiling Bridge, so I was able to lean against Su Xiaoxiao's Tomb Pavilion morning and evening. After crossing the bridge and walking along a short stretch of grass by West Lake, you arrive at Manju's cemetery. This time, although I didn't bring a painting box, I brought a camera, so I took a few more photos here. We toured all the scenic spots in Hangzhou. We often went to the solemn and solemn Yue Fei Temple to taste tea and chat. We rowed a small boat to Jingci Temple and asked for some funny and embarrassing fortune slips in front of the statue of the Old Man Under the Moon. We went to Liu Zhuang to drink and appreciate chrysanthemums, stopping only when we were slightly drunk. We draped in moonlight, swayed in the heart of the lake, sang loudly, or meditated silently. We once walked to Yuquan Temple, our feet treading on the stones by the Pearl Pool, shaking out strings of bubbles, competing to see who could do better. We raced to Lingyin; climbed the Twin Peaks; went to Taoguang; ascended Tianzhu; the road was lined with green trees and bamboos, dotted with yellow and white wildflowers, which was especially interesting and lovely. I couldn't help but admire that the autumn in Jiangnan is more tender and charming than the spring in North China. We also climbed over mountains and crossed Nine Streams and Eighteen Gullies, exclaiming along the way as if the road ahead was a dead end! We used the water from Hupao Spring to brew Longjing tea, and the clear fragrance washed away the infinite dust from our souls! We had so much fun; we enjoyed ourselves to the fullest; we forgot our difficulties; we forgot our fatigue; we seemed to not know what sorrow was, our hearts were still young!</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, twelve years later, I came to Hangzhou for the third time, and it was still autumn. But now, the travel companions are different, the mood is different, and the circumstances are different! Those classmates from the art school are scattered! Wen has become the mother of two children. The first time, the mood was excited, and West Lake and I were full of vitality; the second time, the mood was leisurely, and West Lake and I were as happy. But this third time, the mood is desolate, and West Lake and I are as listless and haggard!</p>
<p>When playing with everyone, I am always taciturn and speak little. I am always lost in endless contemplation. I seem to recall something I lost in the past; I also seem to grieve for all the gloomy reality; I also seem to look forward to some illusory dreams of the future! In short, I have thousands of feelings for every grass, every flower, every stone, and every drop of water. I can't express my boundless reverie. My emotions are confused and dizzy. I am like a lamb lost in the mountains and fields!</p>
<p>The first thing that made me sad was that the Su Xiaoxiao Tomb Pavilion at the head of Xiling Bridge was painted with an ugly red color that ruined the scenery. The gate of the Yue Fei Temple also has the same terrible mark. The Qiu Jin Shrine, the revolutionary female martyr who resisted Japan, has disappeared, leaving only a dilapidated memorial tower. I seem to feel that these are all insults to our poetic souls and national souls given to us by the enemy and puppets!</p>
<p>The second thing that made me sad was that the Manju cemetery had become a wasteland. The white crane on the grave had flown away, and the green pines and cypresses around the grave were nowhere to be found. The ground was covered with withered grass, and the remaining lotus flowers by the lake added to the infinite sorrow! Gushan asking for plum blossoms yielded no news! A few withered poles stood rigidly on the wasteland. The Release Crane Pavilion was intact, but the Expo Bridge under the pavilion was torn down, supposedly used by the Japanese as construction material. The pavilions and towers of Three Pools Mirroring the Moon and Peaceful Lake in Autumn Moon are all dilapidated, obviously in a state of disrepair for many years, which makes people feel unbearable desolation!</p>
<p>The scenery of Liu Zhuang still has traces of its former splendor, but it is also full of dust and dirt, and the garden is full of weeds. The former grand occasion of chrysanthemums is gone, and only a few withered lotus flowers remain in a pool of stagnant water.</p>
<p>Everyone wanted to visit the Old Man Under the Moon in Jingci Temple, and one friend was eager to ask for a fortune slip for good news. But the boatman told us that Jingci Temple was also demolished by the Japanese, and the Old Man Under the Moon was buried in the flames! Hearing this news, everyone felt infinite regret! Everyone complained for this matchmaker who specialized in doing good deeds—the Old Man Under the Moon! Mr. Hong Shen said humorously: "No wonder there are so many tragedies today. It turns out that the Old Man Under the Moon has died a natural death, and no one is helping lovers to tie the knot, so they can't become couples!" Han Sheng said it even more wonderfully. He wished the Old Man Under the Moon would show a miracle and punish Japanese men to all become widowers!</p>
<p>This time I didn't go to Nine Streams and Eighteen Gullies, but only went to Lingyin. In front of the Jigong Buddha statue, everyone asked for fortune slips to ask about luck; to ask about wealth; to ask about safety; to ask about the current situation. Mr. Hong Shen asked for a very auspicious slip for Mr. Gen, which roughly told him: Where there is a will, there is a way. So he immediately made a grand oath that once Mr. Gen is realized, he would raise gold bars to build a temple to thank the Bodhisattva. Everyone rejoiced for this vague hope, and even the old monk laughed heartily! I also asked for a slip to ask about good and bad fortune. The first sentence on the slip was: "Suddenly hearing thunder without wind or rain," and my heart couldn't help but skip a few beats. Heaven, am I, such a silent and calm person, still have to suffer thunder strikes innocently without wind or rain? I don't believe it, but I am a little afraid!</p>
<p>I didn't have time to go to Taoguang and Tianzhu again. On the way back, I played at Yuquan Temple, and everyone stomped on the edge of the Pearl Pool to make bubbles. I didn't, my heart was so heavy that it seemed like it would fall if I stepped on it.</p>
<p>Finally, I paid homage to Yue Fei's tomb. Qin Hui and his wife were still kneeling in front of Yue Fei. At this time, I thought: Why not add two more bronze statues and let Wang Jingwei and his wife also kneel to our Yue Wumu and repent?</p>
<p>At dusk, I walked out of the Yue Fei's tomb, and the sound of the bell rang, breaking my daydream!</p>
<p>On the morning of my departure, I wandered alone on the Bai Causeway lined with green willows. The West Lake was calm and waveless. As the autumn wind rose, a fallen leaf drifted on the water. There were few tourists, and small boats were lonely moored under the embankment. The shadows of the sails swayed like a school of fish. A few faint bird calls were like a few sighs, as if murmuring:</p>
<p>'Ten years of wind and rain have sickened West Lake! Ten years of vicissitudes have aged West Lake! Ten years of separation, old friends no longer have their old moods! Ten years of dreams, all are depressing!'</p>
<p>I shed a few tears silently! I silently prayed: May West Lake have regained its health when I come again for the fourth time; regained its youth; I have also regained my joy; and the entire universe has regained its peaceful and happy appearance!</p>

<p>Everyone knows that time sometimes flies as fast as a bird, and sometimes crawls as slow as a snail; but the happiest time is when one doesn't notice whether it passes quickly or slowly.</p>
<p>What's the use of discussing the future? Nine-tenths of the future is not up to us. If there is an opportunity to do something at that time—it is best not to have it; if there is no opportunity—at least you can congratulate yourself for not saying many boring empty words in advance.</p>
<h3 id="e153">Addendum to "Bai Ju Chang" <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>— Qi Liang</p>
<p>I just saw Mr. Bao's "Shi Nai'an in Bai Ju Chang" in Shen Bao's "Chun Qiu," which is no less than a testimony to Shi Nai'an's life, which is really gratifying.</p>
<p>A Mr. Wu from Xinghua, whose name I'm sorry I can't remember, told me that Shi Nai'an lived in Cao Yan Town, Dianhua, ninety miles away from the city. There are many people with the surname Shi in the town, who are Shi Nai'an's descendants. According to us, Shi Nai'an was originally from Zhongzhou. At the end of the Yuan Dynasty, Zhang Shicheng raised troops. He helped Shicheng. Later, Shicheng failed, and Zhu Yuanzhang became the emperor. He was suspicious and murderous, so he lived in Cao Yan Town and never came out again.</p>
<p>I remember reading a "Chenjiang Old Tales" of some kind, but I forgot who wrote it. It seems that there was such a passage: Shi Nai'an, courtesy name Zi'an, was from Huaian. During the reign of Emperor Shun of Yuan Dynasty, he was awarded a Jinshi and served as a tutor for the Xu family in Jiangyin. He once served as an official in Qiantang. When Zhang Shicheng occupied Gaoyou, he recruited him, but he refused. Shicheng was defeated, and Shi Nai'an also died.</p>
<p>A Mr. Hu once confirmed to me that he had been to Baiju Bridge in Dongtai and checked the Shi family genealogy of Baiju Bridge. What was recorded on the genealogy was exactly like this. Now, after reading Mr. Bao's article, I know that Baiju Bridge is a mistake for Baiju Chang. And Baiju Chang has Shi Nai'an's collateral descendants, Shi Nai'an's ancestral hall, and Shi Gong's tomb. Cao Yan Town also has Shi Nai'an's descendants, so Shi Nai'an's later years should have been spent between Xinghua and Dongtai.</p>
<p>Hu Yinglin's Zhuang Yue Wei Tan calls Shi Nai'an a certain Shi from Wulin, probably because he heard that he had served as an official in Qiantang, that's why he said that. It also said that he wrote the Water Margin like that, and his disciple Luo also imitated him to write the Romance of the Three Kingdoms. Li Zhuowu's 120-chapter version of Water Margin is titled Shi Ji compiled, Luo revised, and Jin Shenghuan's 70-chapter version argues that everything after the 70th chapter is Luo Guanzhong's superfluous ending. Since Shi Nai'an and Guanzhong were both master and disciple, and there were these imitations and collaborations in their creation, they should have often been together. Wang Qi's Continued Comprehensive Examination of Literature says that Guanzhong was from Hangzhou (Dongdu). Based on this, perhaps Shi Nai'an's original hometown was Zhongzhou, but he spent more time in the south as an official, teacher, and writer.</p>
<p>He was a northerner, and he was also awarded a Jinshi, so he may not have been satisfied with the corrupt government. Or he was a southerner. At that time, southerners were even lower than northerners, so he couldn't stand the various insults and persecutions. When Zhang Shicheng revolted in Baiju Chang, he joined. "Refused to be recruited," this statement may not be reliable. Shi Nai'an's descendants were afraid that Zhu Yuanzhang would see that Shi Nai'an helped Shicheng and massacre his family, so they had to write "refused," but in fact he "joined."</p>
<p>Afterwards, Shicheng was defeated and died, and Shi Nai'an returned to Baiju Chang, which he commemorated, and moved his resistance to dark politics from the battlefield to the literary field, and thus the Water Margin was produced, which is very possible, right?</p>
<p>There is no book to examine, so I will record it for the time being, and I will use it to consult with the wise. Fortunately, Dongtai and Xinghua are not far away, so it will not be difficult to conduct on-the-spot investigations in the future.</p>
<h3 id="e154">Shi Nai'an and Zhang Shicheng <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Zhexing</p>
<p>I read Mr. Bao Yujun's article "Shi Nai'an in Bai Ju Chang" in the October 29th issue of this journal, which records the story of Shi Nai'an, the author of Water Margin, in Bai Ju Chang between Xinghua and Dongtai in northern Jiangsu. Mr. Bao personally visited the place and saw Mr. Shi's ancestral hall and his descendants, and paid homage to this great author, which makes people yearn for it.</p>
<p>Shi Nai'an stayed in Xinghua for the longest time. Because Bai Ju belongs to a famous town in the eastern part of Xinghua, the people of Xinghua have long regarded Mr. Shi as a native of Xinghua. Mr. Bao Yujun said that Shi was from Luoyang, which must be based on something, but according to my judgment, perhaps Shi Nai'an's original home was Luoyang, but he lived in Xinghua until he died of old age. The time is long, and it is no different from belonging to Xinghua.</p>
<p>Because we are talking about Shi Nai'an's presence in Bai Ju, we have to mention Zhang Shicheng, who once claimed to be king in Suzhou and was loved by the people so much that they have not forgotten him to this day. And Shi Nai'an has a very deep relationship with Zhang Shicheng. Zhang is also from Bai Ju, so it is very valuable to describe it.</p>
<p>Zhang Shicheng's childhood name was "Xiao Si." He was from Bai Ju, Xinghua. Bai Ju was a salt farm by the sea. Zhang made a living by selling salt when he was young. He and Shi Nai'an once studied literature and martial arts with the same teacher. Their skills were comparable. At the end of the Yuan Dynasty, when the government was corrupt and the political situation was corrupt, heroes from all over the world rose up. The two of them took it as their duty to save the country and appease the people. Later, Zhang Shicheng claimed to be King of Wu in Suzhou, and Shi Nai'an served as a privy councillor, assisting in military affairs and making many achievements. Unfortunately, many of the plans failed to be implemented later, and the two of them became suspicious of each other. Finally, Shi Nai'an abandoned his old friend and went to work as a tutor in the house of a big landlord in Jiangyin. The loss of this arm and assistant to the King of Wu greatly affected the later success or failure. However, the scale left by Shi Nai'an made Zhang Shicheng always love the people like his own children. This kind of virtue may not be comparable to Zhu Yuanzhang and Chen Youliang at the same time. It is a pity that Zhang and Shi could not cooperate to the end, otherwise the world at that time might not have belonged to a monk.</p>
<p>In addition to teaching students in the house of a landlord in Jiangyin, Shi Nai'an saw that the owner's wealth was abundant and that he could make a great career, so he strongly urged the owner to revolt, and also recruited many patriots and local braves for active training. However, the owner later failed to rise up in time due to different interests, which Shi regretted very much, so he left in disappointment. However, the people's morale in Jiangyin has since flourished. The later heroic deeds of resisting Japanese pirates and defending against thieves, as well as the martyrs who died in various disasters, were all inspired by this.</p>
<p>After Shi Nai'an left Jiangyin, he realized that the general trend was over and the world would belong to the Ming Dynasty, so he returned to his hometown of Bai Ju and closed the door to write books. Thus, this great work—Water Margin—was produced. The writing style of Water Margin is vivid and profound. Some people say it is very similar to the Records of the Grand Historian. Indeed, Shi Nai'an's depressed feelings were similar to Sima Qian's anger in his heart, so their works were all expressing their anger. If Shi Nai'an could have been successful and domineering in that era, he would definitely not have had the time to write Water Margin. This is a blessing for us later generations. To be private, fortunately, Mr. Shi Nai'an was not successful in his life, otherwise his achievements would be remarkable, but he would definitely not be able to release such a wonderful flower in literature. The old people have seen enough of the so-called heroic and domineering achievements of kings in ancient and modern times. They say that it is better to have a pot of clear tea and read Water Margin in their spare time!</p>
<h3 id="e155">An Inch of Mountains and Rivers, An Inch of Blood 82 <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>When I got to the stream, I was suddenly startled to hear what sounded like a few dog barks from within the restricted area. I asked Tiger if he heard it, and he said absentmindedly, "There must always be dogs, right?" I also thought that wherever there are Japanese devils, there are bound to be vicious dogs. These dogs trained by the Japanese devils are vicious and brutal. Not only can they track by scent, jump, bite, and devour, but they are also good at stealing, ambushing, luring the enemy, giving alarms, and fighting. If they don't bite you, fine, but once they bite you, you can't escape. Moreover, once they smell blood, they will turn into wild beasts and have to tear people apart and chew them into pieces.</p>
<p>It was already past seven o'clock, and dusk had fallen. The clouds were very low, and details of the scenery could not be distinguished beyond two or three zhang, only a blur. We hid in the wild thickets by the stream, planning to cross the stream. Tiger casually picked up a few small stones from the ground and threw them into the water one by one, from near to far. Seeing the speed at which the bubbles rose, he knew that the stream was not deep, at most reaching waist height.</p>
<p>"Aunt, I'll go first!" Tiger tied the small bag slung over his body to his belt, held a pistol in each hand, turned to look at me, and stepped into the water. I also acted nimbly, glanced around, and followed Tiger into the water, probing with each step. Although Tiger was eight or nine years younger than me, he was almost half an inch taller than me. We both could swim, so the water wasn't scary. What was hateful was the mud at the bottom of the stream. No matter how hard you tried to hold your breath, your feet would always sink half a foot, and it was really hard to pull each step out. At the deepest point, the water was already up to our waists. Fortunately, it wasn't stagnant water, and there was no smell. Anyway, my clothes were already soaked with sweat, so it wasn't too uncomfortable.</p>
<p>When we reached the bank, because it was a slope of soil with no cover, we had to crouch down and crawl along the slope, step by step. We had just climbed to the base of the stone wall when a beam of light, like lightning, swept across the stream from the wild thickets on the opposite bank to the base of the wall. The sudden beam of light startled me into a cold sweat, and my heart beat so hard that it almost hit my throat. Tiger and I instinctively reached out at the same time and stopped each other, as if to press our bodies into the wall.</p>
<p>"Oh, did the devils see us?" Tiger whispered in surprise.</p>
<p>"Not necessarily," I reassured Tiger, "it seems like the light is coming from the bridge over there, isn't it?"</p>
<p>We both leaned our backs against the stone wall, sat at the base of the wall, and stretched our legs straight down the slope to minimize our target. At this time, we couldn't move rashly, we could only wait for the situation to develop. The seven-character secret of espionage training came in handy here: "Cold" and "Endure."</p>
<p>While we waited quietly, we both secretly held our weapons in our hands, perhaps a second later, bullets would be raining down on us. At this time, what was most useful was the ear, followed by the eye, so I focused my energy on the two senses of hearing and sight. Although I was brave and clear-headed, I still felt my heart pounding. Our feeling at this time was like two deer being restrained by hunting dogs, only prepared for a death match.</p>
<p>I think after five or six minutes at most, the searchlight swept across again. I heard Tiger muttering to himself in a whisper that could barely be heard: "Damn it, if you have the guts, come over here, who are you scaring with this ghost fire?"</p>
<p>Just then, I heard the sound of military boots stepping on the gravel road far away on the other side of the stone wall. It seemed like there was only one person, walking towards us from the bridge, very slowly. After a while, I heard a huffing and puffing sound, like a kind of mighty aura emanating from a huge beast, mixed with heavy footsteps, getting closer and closer to us.</p>

<h3 id="e156">Sold by Auction <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>— Shao Fu</p>
<p>The Central Trust Bureau's second public notice for the auction of 39 units of enemy and puppet properties was published the day before yesterday. On the same day, the residents of these 39 units issued an urgent notice. The situation between the two sides is very tense. If this matter is handled improperly, it may lead to unexpected events.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the heads of the Trust Bureau and the Disposal Bureau expressed their opinions on the matter. The first paragraph of the news stated:</p>
<p>"Since the victory, the housing shortage in this city has been serious. In order to assist the government in solving housing difficulties, the Central Trust Bureau has planned to advance funds to build houses and sell them in installments. The estimated cost is 40 billion yuan, which will be funded by a banking syndicate established by national banks and commercial banks, and a method for advancing construction funds has been drafted and submitted to the Joint Treasury for approval. This plan was just approved by the 325th board meeting of the Joint Treasury on October 24. Before it is actually implemented... (The following talks about selling it by auction)."</p>
<p>Yes, yes, you see, the government is already trying to help you, but before it is actually implemented, it will sell this batch of real estate first, yes, yes, you really don't know how to appreciate it!</p>
<p>How can people who are suffering from the pain of losing their homes know how to appreciate it? These people are neither silkworms nor children, but the Trust Bureau is asking them to give up the big cake in their hands that they desperately need to fill their stomachs and imagine the Manchu Han banquet next year.</p>
<p>Can't they just use this 40 billion yuan to buy this batch of houses and rent them out to the original tenants? Combining fundraising, construction, and auction into one thing is the most wise way, and it also fulfills the government's goal of solving the housing difficulties of the common people. I think the wise Trust Bureau and Disposal Bureau will definitely consider this.</p>

<h3 id="e157">Idle Talk on Earthquakes <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>— Jinxia</p>
<p>Newspapers report: A strong earthquake occurred in the northwest of Tokyo on the afternoon of the 2nd, lasting for four hours.</p>
<p>Here, let's talk about earthquakes in passing:</p>
<p>The Earth is constantly experiencing various minute molecular movements, which are usually not easily noticed by humans because these vibrations are extremely slight. However, under special circumstances, drastic changes occur, and this is what we call an earthquake.</p>
<p>There are three causes of earthquakes: volcanic eruptions, land subsidence, and fault rupture.</p>
<p>During volcanic eruptions, the surrounding areas are shaken, causing houses to collapse and people to be injured. However, earthquakes are limited to the volcanic region and cause relatively little damage. Land subsidence occurs when limestone in the Earth's crust is eroded by groundwater. A portion of the minerals is dissolved, creating cavities and fissures. The supporting force is weakened, leading to downward subsidence and causing subsidence earthquakes. As the Earth gradually cools and contracts, folding occurs, causing cracks in the deep inner layers of the Earth. The Earth's crust moves up and down along these deep, large cracks, resulting in fault rupture earthquakes, which have the widest range and greatest intensity.</p>
<p>Records</p>
<p>Earthquakes have occurred since the beginning of recorded history, and even today, there is a possibility of earthquakes happening anytime, anywhere. In the past, the French seismologist Bayeux alone collected records of 170,000 earthquakes from various countries. Statistical analysis revealed that earthquakes commonly occur in two major regions: around the Pacific Ocean and along the Mediterranean Sea, the Alps, the Caucasus Mountains, and the Himalayas.</p>
<p>In the past twenty years, countries that have experienced earthquakes include: Turkey, Japan, Chile, Romania, the United States, China, Bulgaria, Yugoslavia, Argentina, the Soviet Union, Mexico, France, Italy, India, Greece, and fifteen other countries.</p>
<p>Tragic Extremes</p>
<p>The following are records of some of the most devastating earthquakes with the highest casualties and greatest losses: The Great Tokyo Earthquake in Japan in 1923 killed over 84,000 people in Tokyo, and Yokohama was also affected, with over 40,000 deaths and injuries. On January 24, 1939, a violent earthquake occurred in southern Chile, affecting dozens of cities. Among the 200,000 residents in the disaster area, the death toll reached 25 percent—50,000 people—and nine cities were completely destroyed. On November 10, 1940, a major earthquake struck southeastern Europe, with Romania bearing the brunt. Over 10,000 people were killed or injured. The twelve-story Carlton Apartments, the most solid reinforced concrete building in the capital of Romania, collapsed in the earthquake, burying many travelers in the rubble. However, the night watchman of the apartment, who was on duty when the earthquake struck, used a heavy blanket to protect his head and jumped from the twelve-story building. Although seriously injured, he still reported the incident to the fire department. The most tragic earthquake in China was the Gansu earthquake, which killed over 200,000 people. There were many places where the ground collapsed, with lengths of 3,000 to 4,000 feet, widths of 2,000 feet, and depths of 400 to 500 feet, burying houses, people, and livestock.</p>
<p>False Alarm</p>
<p>There were also earthquakes that only caused false alarms without any loss of life. On the night of June 29, 1942, several violent earthquakes suddenly occurred in the capital of Chile. In their panic, residents ran barefoot and naked to the center of the streets. After standing there for a long time, the earthquakes suddenly stopped, with no deaths or injuries. In Paris, minor earthquakes occurred continuously in March 1940. Many citizens were asleep and unaware of these events. It was not until they read the newspapers the next morning that they breathed a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>Although they are all earthquakes, there are differences between fortune and misfortune.</p>

<p>I saw in the newspaper that the central government has decided to adjust the salaries of public school teachers. Changzhou, where I am located, is listed in the second tier. According to the standard calculation, the monthly income can reach more than 100,000. I was dreaming of how to buy new clothes, but reality woke me up.</p>
<p>Two months ago, in almost the same position in the same newspaper, I saw the news of adjusting the treatment of public school teachers. The standard for the Jiangsu region was a base of 55,000 yuan, multiplied by 240 times, which was about two-thirds more than the original standard at that time. Upon hearing the news, I also planned how to buy new clothes and shoes, but waiting, waiting, the central level was implemented, and the provincial level was also implemented, but it "stopped here". Because we are at the county level, we are not qualified to benefit. Colleagues often ask each other: Is it because county-level civil servants do less work than civil servants above? Obviously not! I had the opportunity to talk to the local officials about this issue, and he told me that the reason is that the local income is insufficient. The county collects and spends on its own. Although the standard is increased, there is no money to increase. I believe this is true, but I want to ask the authorities: When making the decision, did you think that after the standard is set, provincial-level and below civil servants can be ignored if the local income is insufficient? Or did you not consider that the local government would have no money to pay after the standard was set, so you did not find a way to subsidize it so that the decision could be implemented? Before I understand this answer, I dare not have any hope for this adjustment.</p>
<p>Today, a friend met me and asked me with certainty: "Salary increase?" "Not increased!" I can only temporarily answer like this.</p>
<h3 id="e159">To Sanmao <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>— Xiaotian</p>
<p>Dear Sanmao,</p>
<p>I admire your ability. Although you are an innocent and lively underage child, your ambition, wisdom, and courage... are everywhere like an adult. No, even adults are not as good as you, especially in dealing with people. You can handle it freely and actively among the leaders and comrades. This surprises me that you are an extraordinary child, and it is also a characteristic that surpasses ordinary children. Precisely because of your youth, you are often humiliated by your superiors and bullied by your comrades, but you are not discouraged or resentful... You still stand firmly on your position, grasp your own responsibilities, and use your patriotic wisdom to strike at the enemy everywhere.</p>
<p>When you take off your military uniform and bid farewell to your superiors, embarking on the social journey, that V-shaped fork in the road is forcing you, standing there helplessly, looking down at the cross-shaped cemetery beside the road, which is full of fighters who died on the battlefield. Here are your comrades you used to get along with, as well as patriots who have made meritorious deeds and gloriously sacrificed themselves, and martyrs who have been recorded in history. Now, they are all silently sleeping in the underworld. I think you will also feel infinite sadness in your heart, but when you look up at the tip of the V, I am afraid you will feel pain more unbearable than death—unemployment, that corner of the house covered with cobwebs, and the high chimneys, are the closed factories—(no work to do). On the other hand, the so-called "returning to hometown after demobilization", the remaining dead trees, you can't see houses, and you can't see smoke. When I see you have no place to live and no food to eat, I can't help but take a cold breath for you. Is it true that after serving the country for several years, you will be vaguely unprotected and end up like this? You are really too young. Naturally, you don't have a thorough understanding of the vicissitudes of the world and the warmth and coldness of human relationships. However, you don't have to be pessimistic. This is precisely the life you have tasted, and it is also an alarm bell that tells you to "rely on your own efforts." I hope that you will persevere in the will you had when you joined the army, endure it, fail once and come again until you succeed. On the uneven road of life, you are only allowed to advance and not retreat!</p>
<p>I have been concerned about your news, and I wish you good health!</p>
<h3 id="e160">Past Events of the Traitor Zhou <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>— Luo</p>
<p>The traitor Zhou Fohai has recently been publicly tried. It is said that on the day of the trial, the wooden benches of the High Court in the capital were crushed. No wonder Zhou felt very embarrassed. I accidentally flipped through Zhou's masterpiece "Collection of the Past" during the enemy and puppet period. In "Record of a Fire", Zhou described the experience of his residence being burned down during the puppet government era. Now, when Zhou has become a "prisoner awaiting execution", reading it really makes me feel cold for Zhou. The original text is excerpted as follows: —</p>
<p>"When the fire was raging, the first person to come to comfort and take care of us was Madam Wang. When she heard the news, she immediately ran to take care of us, and she was afraid that we had no place to live, so she immediately called Minyi and vacated a few rooms in his house. Because Madam Minyi went to Shanghai, the house could be vacated. Then she accompanied us to Minyi's house..."</p>
<p>If those "causality experts" or word-splitting gentlemen analyze the above sentences, we really feel cold for Zhou's future "destination". Chu Minyi has been executed, and "Madam Wang" still wants to introduce Zhou to live in Chu's haunted house. Zhou's betrayal of the country was also pulled in by the traitor Chen Bijun. Think about how chilling it is.</p>
<p>In "Feelings After Four Travels to Beiping", Zhou described the grand occasion of welcoming him after the puppet government returned to Ping in the 29th year of the Republic of China, when local pedestrian traffic was cut off.</p>
<p>"But even more than 30 years ago, even when princes and ministers went out, the traffic was not completely cut off. As a poor student, I actually entered and exited the capital of hundreds of years of emperors, and the traffic was cut off. Subconsciously, I couldn't help but feel proud. However, it was not like this more than 30 years ago. It was not like this when China was unified. I really felt that it was not perfect."</p>
<p>In fact, at that time, the traitors of the puppet government were often assassinated. Therefore, the only way to maintain security was to cut off traffic. Zhou actually became "self-comfortable". Aren't you afraid that the readers will be horrified?</p>
<p>In "Trip to Guangzhou", Zhou said again:</p>
<p>"...Take off at 11 o'clock, bypass Hong Kong and enter the Pearl River Basin. When passing through Hong Kong, I recalled the scene when I flew to Jiuneng with Gongbo in Hanoi in December of the 27th year, and Siping went to the airport to pick us up. It is still vivid in my mind..."</p>
<p>Zhou is really sentimental and full of emotion. Traitor Chen and Traitor Mei are now waiting for you at the airport in the underworld. Please wait patiently to meet.</p>

<h3 id="e162">Remembering Ma Chaojun <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>— Younan</p>
<p>……The new Minister of Agriculture and Labor……</p>
<p>Anyone who has stayed in Nanjing after the victory must be familiar with Ma Chaojun, who presided over the capital for the second time.</p>
<p>For Nanjing, it is certainly difficult to be the mayor; first, it is the seat of the National Government, and it is related to the observation of China and foreign countries. One can be scolded if one is not careful. After the victory, Nanjing was always not very energetic, the streets and roadsides were messy and lifeless. I remember that when Chairman Jiang first triumphantly returned to the capital, he did not show satisfaction with everything in the capital. However, from the perspective of the municipal government of Nanjing, there was little money and much work, and various difficulties.</p>
<p>Two Horses Fighting</p>
<p>The most sensational thing in Nanjing during Mayor Ma's tenure was an article in the Central Daily News in Nanjing advocating the prohibition of dancing. The title was "Accept the Provocation of the Municipal Government". The article said, "Nanjing under Mayor Ma's rule is obviously provoking us who advocate frugality." The most intense sentence in the article had the words "you die or I live", which made Mayor Ma quite embarrassed for a while. At that time, the matter was mediated by Ma Yuanfang, the deputy mayor of Nanjing, and the Dagang News made a title saying: "Two Horses Fight, Another Horse Mediates." (Note: The president of the Central Daily News in Nanjing was Ma Xingye)</p>
<p>In all fairness, there are indeed many things that were not satisfactory in Nanjing under Mayor Ma's rule. Now, the mayor of Nanjing has changed, and Mr. Ma has been transferred to the Minister of Agriculture and Labor. We hope that Nanjing and the Ministry of Agriculture and Labor will be able to find someone who is deeply competent.</p>
<p>According to Mr. Ma's research experience in the labor movement for ten years, Mr. Ma has compiled and written books such as "Chinese Labor Problems", "Agricultural and Labor Policies of the Chinese Kuomintang", "Wage and Price Index Table", and "Agricultural Product Price Index Table", all of which were completed in his spare time. Today, he has been transferred to a new position, and I think it should be more suitable for Mr. Ma's talents.</p>
<p>Ma Chaojun, also known as Ma Gong, is from Taishan, Guangdong. He graduated from "Bili Mechanical School" in Hong Kong in his early years. After that, he went to Japan to study at Meiji University, and devoted himself to the revolutionary cause, starting in the 33rd year of Guangxu. At that time, Mr. Ma advocated the revolution in Qinlian, Guangdong Province. He was arrested by the local official Guo Renzhang and released on bail by the American pastor Xia Shigu. Before the uprising of the Seventy-Two Martyrs of Huanghuagang, Mr. Ma hid explosives in his hair (at that time, long hair was still braided) and transported them from Hong Kong to Guangzhou to support the revolutionaries, but he was not discovered.</p>
<p>During the Wuchang Uprising, Mr. Ma served as the captain of the daredevil team and was stationed at the Hanyang Arsenal. In the second year of the Republic of China, he was falsely accused and imprisoned in the Hubei Army Prison by the order of Li Yuanhong, and was released after four months.</p>
<p>Leading the Labor Movement</p>
<p>After the tenth year of the Republic of China, Mr. Ma abandoned arms and devoted himself to the labor movement and education, and was elected as a municipal senator in Guangzhou. In the eleventh year, the traitor Chen Jiongming rebelled, and Mr. Ma and his wife Shen Huilian protected Madam Sun from danger. After the incident was quelled, the national father Sun Yat-sen became a propaganda member of the headquarters, and soon he was transferred to the director of the Guangdong Arsenal. In March of the fourteenth year, the national father went north, and he was ill in Tianjin. From the onset of the illness until his death, Mr. Ma stayed by his side and personally prepared the medicine.</p>
<p>In the eighteenth year, Mr. Ma was often selected as a central executive committee member. In April, he was sent to attend the International Labor Conference in Geneva, proposing that "colored people should be treated equally with all member states", and he finally passed it with his unyielding spirit.</p>
<p>Mr. Ma first served as the mayor of Nanjing in April of the twenty-fourth year of the Republic of China, and he was reinstated after the victory.</p>
<p>In Nanjing, the most impressive thing to me was Mr. Ma and his wife (Shen Huilian). Both of their sons were big and strong, and in the dance parties that entertained the allies, their "big dance" always caused laughter.</p>
