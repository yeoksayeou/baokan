<h3>馬司聯袂訪蔣主席　企求打開和平之門　美正注視馬帥調停發展</h3>
<p>〔合衆社南京十三日電〕美國駐華特使馬歇爾將軍及駐華大使司徒雷登，十三日下午五時聯袂往訪蔣主席，以謀對垂死之和平談判，作最後之努力。此次會議極關重要，至於結果如何，目下尙無所知。馬司兩氏於訪問蔣主席前，先於今晨會談兩小時。此間消息靈通人士認爲調人雖不斷努力，但國共問題解決之一切希望，實際上已完全消失矣。同時共產黨代表董必武與王炳南，今日竟日在家，據共產黨方面消息，共產黨之正式答覆正由周恩來根據延安訓令在上海起草中，預料將於明後日送達南京。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十三日電〕馬特使十三日上午十時赴大使館與司徒大使接談，至十二時許始出，下午八時大使再訪馬特使，據悉兩調人對和談問題仍願盡最大努力，企使瀕於破裂之危局，即有轉機，並確信國共間糾紛表面看去雖屬軍事，實際仍爲政治，故戰事應不致影響政治商談。聞兩氏將仍就政治方面求取途徑，以解決軍事問題，惟馬司兩氏一二日內，或仍保持緘默暫不表示任何意見。</p>
<p>〔路透社南京十三日電〕某報載，預料馬司二調人，不久將發表第三次聯合聲明。</p>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓十二日電〕白宮及美國務院對於有關馬歇爾元帥任務之發展，刻在密切汴意中。</p>
<p>政協代表與孫科商各黨國大名單</p>
<p>〔本報南京十三日電〕十三日中共方面發表頑强表示後，首都人士對時局觀察，咸寄盼於孫院長科之返京，孫於下午四時抵京，休息未半小時，政協代表吳鼎昌，陳立夫，吳鐵城，張厲生，王世杰，邵力子，陳布雷，雷震等，即往孫宅集會商談　進各黨派人士參加國大問題，由孫報吿在滬與各黨派接觸情形，並曾表示，希望彼等來京，據聞在座諸人交換意見甚久，商定政府對各黨派國大名象之提出，在程序上及手續上均留最大餘地並對民盟所提建議再加研究，壉聞已獲有新的決定，並於晚間送呈主席。又靑年黨李璜，十二時搭機飛滬，民盟梁漱溟今晨曾訪李氏晤談，梁對記者表示，不願多發言，僅稱，一切待留滬代表硏究決定。另息，民盟在滬人士，因形勢改觀，雖暫時中止來京，但聞全體態度亦不一致，一部份持重者正在靜　變化，日內或將有新的表示。</p>
<h3>各黨即使不參加國大仍如期舉行</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社南京十二日電〕中共及民主同盟對於政府頒令如期召開國民大會，雖指斥政府意欲粉碎各方面對於國共問題和平解決所有希望，但政府積極籌備，佈置會塲及招待國大代表，所有員工，均日夜工作。據國民大會發言人向本社記者談稱，關於代表名額問題，代表總數爲二千零五十名，其中一千五百六十名，業已選出成指派，政府尙須指定七十四人爲代表，即使各黨派不參加，國大仍將如期舉行，大抵中共與民盟不參加，靑年黨及各黨派代表均將出席。</p>
<h3>共產黨代表團　可能撤返延安</h3>
<p>靑年黨　續促成和平</p>
<p>〔合衆社南京十三日電〕延安中央執行委員會某要員今日强硬表示，中國之和平談判已最後破裂。而此間共產黨某方人士則暗示共產黨代表團可能不久宣布退出談判，返歸延安。當有人詢以共產黨代表團是否將撤返延安時，該方人士謂：「吾人在南京旣無事可做，當然不會逗留於此」。又詢以共產黨代表團何時可能撤退時，則謂　下尙未自延安接到此　命令。</p>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕昨日下午記者赴華山路訪中國靑年黨中央黨部秘書長陳啓天氏，詢其對於中國和平前途之意見，承答如下：中國和平前途，尙未至完全絕望之境，只須大家繼續努力，即不難促成和平，現在時機迫切，希望各方迅速從事商談。以挽回和平之危機，靑年黨方面，渴望和平之心，實未敢後人，當隨國人之後，繼續努力促成和平。</p>

<p>莫斯科電台亦予廣播　　〔中央社莫斯科十三日電〕此間各報本日刋載塔斯社十月十日自南京所發關於蔣主席雙十廣播辭一訊，今晨莫斯科電台亦廣播該訊。</p>
<h3>平漢鐵路北段　戰事側重兩端</h3>
<p>石家莊外圍突緊張</p>
<p>〔本報北平十三日電〕平漢路北段戰局將改觀，國軍已調剩餘兵力前往驅遂逞能半月之共軍。</p>
<p>〔本報保定十三日電〕石家莊外圍突緊張，共軍正由　沱河沿岸及石家莊西北大量集結兵力，保定市外沉靜，市內成立綏靖協進會，平漢北段戰爭側重兩端，正對共軍主力實行掃蕩，一部國軍已抵徠冰，易縣城。</p>
<p>〔本報天津十三日電〕平漢北段國軍增援部隊，與共軍在定興附近進行激戰，南段戰事亦在定縣，海風店間。</p>
<p>〔中央社保定十三日電〕共軍賀龍部一百廿師主力，刻在保定迤北大王子城一帶活動。共軍新六旅馬輝部，與國軍九十四軍，在高碑店西北楡林村激戰後，潰不成軍，現向徠水方面竄去。</p>
<h3>四平梅河口綫威脅吿消除</h3>
<p>〔本報長春十二日電〕四平，梅河口路威脅已消除，且於雙十節試車，自四平至梅河口全綫，經過良好。</p>
<p>〔本報長春十二日電〕長春以北，年內或不致有軍事行動，某軍事觀察家對記者談稱：國軍目前在東北北部顯呈相安狀態，但共軍果有竄擾行動，國電在力量上，足予以嚴重打擊。至於松江織橋之修復問題，共方頗持異議，認爲該橋修復對松北共軍各據點有致命之威脅，實際此種看法純爲共軍心理上一種不安之自擾。</p>
<h3>劉翰東談話</h3>
<p>深盼共軍停止竄擾　以免人民再罹兵燹</p>
<p>〔中央社長春十一日電〕四平電話，遼北省主席劉翰東，對遼北共軍發動攻勢，不法佔領西豐，攻擊東豐，西安事件，特發表談話，謂本人奉中央命令主持省政，守土有責，深望共軍能及時覺悟，停止竄擾企圖，以免我東北民衆刦後餘生，再罹兵燹，否則本人職責所在，自當督飭所屬，守土衛民，而由此引起之一切後果，自當由共軍方面負之也。</p>
<h3>懷來宣化均收復　孫傳兩部國軍即可會師　延安正式承認退出張垣</h3>
<p>〔本報北平十三日電〕鏖戰旬餘之懷來戰綫，終於十三日晨二時被國軍完全擊潰，共軍殘部以汽車二百餘輛急向蔚縣退却，懷來正式收復，現過懷來正面之國軍，已與先期繞過懷來而收復下花園之部隊相銜接，刻平綏東段迄下花園已無共軍正面抵抗，該方面國軍即可與昨下午收復宣化之傳作義部會師，而貫通張垣以東平綏綫，現察省戰事除柴溝堡方面詳情不明外，共軍殆已完全喪失戰意，按懷來之戰酷烈非常，兩軍損失均慘重，共軍掘有數丈寬深溝，阻止坦克，防空工事亦甚强，共軍撤退之重要地點，均置有大量地雷，故軍方特訓練掃雷隊，以助交通當局槍悠鐵路</p>
<p>〔本報北平十三日電〕國軍收復張家口後，繼續分兵兩路，一路向東，業於十二日下午五時三十分進駐宣化，該部日內可與收復下花園之十一戰區長官孫連仲部會師於其間之辛莊子。向西推進之部隊已達柴溝堡，察省共軍殘部已失戰意。</p>

<h3>蔣主席撥款犒軍　陳誠總長晤傳李等商談</h3>
<p>〔本報歸綏十三日電」蔣主席撥五億元，犒賞收復張垣國軍。</p>
<p>〔本報北平十三日電〕陳總長誡十三日淸晨欣聞懷來戰綫共軍被完全擊潰後，上午赴北平行轅與李宗仁等歡聚。</p>
<p>〔本報北平十二日電〕陳總長誠十二日飛歸緩，慰問傅長官後，當晚六時返平。</p>
<p>〔本報歸綏十二日電〕陳誠十二日上午十一時飛臨張垣上空視察，十二時抵綏，與傳長官有所商談，下午返平。同時對此事發表評論如下：張家口的撤離，對人民當然是一個損失，但就現實的軍事觀點來談，對於人民卻沒有造成困難，現時中國內戰決定關鍵，不在少數城市的暫時得失，而在雙方軍事實力的消長，我們在十年內戰開始時，沒有一個城市，在八年抗戰開始時，陜甘密邊區也沒有一個縣城，還能殲滅敵軍實力，而取得勝利；那麼今天在一萬萬四千萬人口的解放區巾，暫時退出一些城鎭來換取殲滅敵軍的條件，又有什麽不好呢？今後解放區人民，解除了對和平的幻想，解除了對保衛張家口城市的負担，以後其軍事力量必更見愈戰愈强，其兵力使用必愈見機動，國民黨的困難必愈見增加，弱點必愈大，戰綫必愈長，其補給必愈難維持，雖然他還可以再佔一些城市，但解放區軍民必更團結一致，發　反抗，在殲滅他的力量到一定程度時，一定能澈底粉碎他的進攻，收復張家口·承德·集寗和淮陰及一切失地。</p>
<h3>張北飛機塲修復</h3>

<h3>平警備司令易人</h3>
<p>〔本報北平十三日電〕十一戰區副長官陳繼承，繼九十二軍軍長侯鈴如之後，任北平警備司令</p>
<h3>平市中外記者　接洽赴張視察</h3>
<p>〔本報北平十三日電〕此間中外記者爲視察戰後張垣，已請平行轅交涉交通工具，李宗仁主任十三日急電傳作義長官，詢問張垣機塲能否迅速修復。</p>
<h3>馮欽哉即赴懷來　主持察哈爾省復員事宜　谷正綱將入察辦理急賑</h3>
<p>〔本報北平十三電〕察主席馮欽哉，定十四日晨離平赴懷來，主持察省復員。</p>
<p>〔本報北平十三日電〕察省主席馮欽哉，已命令駐外地之省保安團即速返省，配合國軍綏靖地方，並命令潛伏省內各縣之地下保安團，起而規復縣城，據云：懷安即係此等保安團所收復。</p>
<p>〔本報北平十三日電〕察省戰事結束在即，善後工作隨之而至，察省府雖已派員隨軍先行，但人財兩缺的環境下，能否馬上展開有效的善後復員工作，而不踏其他收復區的前例，似尙待認眞考慮。省主席馮欽哉昨吿記者，渠已連電傅長官作義，詢問察省現狀，中央已准由四聯總處撥款五億元，由谷部長正綱親自携帶入察辦急賑。但澈底破壞之後，五億元之數似不能收多大效用。另一流亡於北平之察省名流稱：渠憂心大兵過後的地方秩序，如冀東一部縣分，大部隊收復據點後，即交無效的地方團隊維持治安，不但不能控制，甚將得而復失，該時武裝人可以撤走，老百姓便遭了殃，故其將考慮還鄕問題。反之，武裝還鄕隊報復主義也須預先想到，敎科書也還無準備。</p>
<h3>集寗小組辦理　交換國共人員</h3>
<p>〔本報歸綏十二日電〕集寗小組美方代表竇奎士及政府代表尹漢初，十二日晨十時專機由平來綏，下午二時將共方派駐歸綏之聯絡官袁鏗常，電台合長鄭毅等五人接往大同，在該地交換十二戰區派往共區之高級連絡官周北峯及電合人員。</p>

<p>〔中央社北平十三日電〕熱境國軍於收復沽源後，已於十二日上十時進入多倫。</p>
<h3>馬使專機受損</h3>
<p>饒伯森另機飛返美</p>
<p>〔本報南京十三日電〕饒伯森十三日十二時乘專機離京返美，馬特使未往送行。</p>
<p>〔合衆社南京十三日電〕馬歇爾將軍之巨型C—五四型機今晨向上海飛抵此間降落時，因左輸滾入泥地而受損傷。飛機向前翻去，損壞引擎三座。機中僅有駕駛員在內，無人受傷。該機飛往南京之任務，係接送饒伯森及其眷屬前往東。但在一小時左右後，同一駕駛員則駕另一架C—五四型載饒氏及其眷屬啓程。</p>

<h3>前中印緬美軍總司令　史迪威將軍病逝　蔣主席特電致唁史夫人</h3>
<p>〔中央社舊金山十二日合衆電〕前中緬印區美軍總司令史迪威（見岡）上將，已在此間醫院因肝病逝世，年六十三歲，彼現任第六軍長，彼係於九月廿八日入醫院，檢査肝臟，五日後陸軍軍醫即爲施行手術，病况木已較佳，本月九日，突然轉劣，體力日弱，終於十二日下午三時四十八分逝世。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京十三日電〕史迪威將軍在美病逝，蔣主席聞訊，特電致唁，原文如下：史迪威將軍夫人禮鑒，驚聞史迪威將軍病逝，不勝慟悼，又悉將軍之疾，係在印緬領導華軍及其他盟軍並肩作戰時所致，將軍之死，不特爲吾夫婦所痛惜、且爲全中國人民之一損夫，蔣中正。</p>
<h3>哀念史迪威</h3>
<p>— 本報編輯室</p>
<p>死無遺憾</p>
<p>「假使我能證明中國士兵像任何盟國士兵一樣好，我就死無遺憾了」。</p>
<p>這句話是史迪威上將開始在印度訓練中國軍隊時對記者說的，現在史將軍已在美病逝，惡耗傳來，我國軍民對於這位厥功甚偉的大將的去世，自必哀痛逾恒；但是史上將已無遺憾了，因爲中國士兵已被證明和世界任何士兵一樣的勇敢善戰。</p>
<p>史氏在一九四二年三月三日到達中國，即負責策劃並指揮緬甸戰役。他生平有二十年的時間服務於中國，他熟，悉中文，日文，也熟悉中國部隊的能力與需要。兩年八個月中，緬甸一役，反守爲攻，這是他功績的主要部份。</p>
<p>本報編譯定</p>
<p>史迪威是每個士兵的叔父和老人，他是他的軍隊的父親。他路過戰地醫院，總要停住，用中國話向傷兵問候。他時常同中美士兵生活在一起，吃他們的醃菜，隨便談笑，他在叢林中到處突然出現。</p>
<p>民國卅一年春季，日軍在緬境獲得成功，盟軍被逐出，史迪威上將就在此時立志報仇雪恥，他擔任了中印緬戰區美軍司令，在那時候，他就有了打開一條通往中國的新供應路的計劃，同時他要在印度建立一些訓練中心，由美國人員訓練出一支新的現代的中國軍隊來。</p>
<p>計劃實現</p>
<p>民國卅一年十月，他的計劃開始實現了。許多英美軍官認爲這是不可能的，他們指出史迪威的行動，祇是增加華軍士氣的政治表演；但是事實證明史氏並不是政治家，他是個十分實際的人。</p>
<p>印度訓練中心最初建立的時候，以孫立人和廖耀湘少將從緬甸撤退的中國軍隊爲核心，後來逐漸擴大，一年後，美國訓練的一師華軍，携帶最新式的美國武器，離開了印度的訓練中心到了前綫。在緬甸淪陷後的一年半，中國軍隊的攻勢開始了，這是中國對日作戰六年來第一次的眞正攻勢行動。</p>
<p>史迪威將軍時常親上火綫，這種大無長精神，獲得了中國士兵對他的尊崇和敬重。在他領導之下，兩師中國軍隊佔領了日寇盤據的一千多平方英里的領土，打死日寇七千多，深人日寇佔領區，這是遠東戰爭爆發以來，任何盟軍在亞洲大陸所未能做到的。</p>
<p>英勇故事</p>
<p>要描寫史迪威的戰績與爲人，我們應該追述他在緬甸的一段故事。</p>
<p>胡康之戰的時候，有一次史迪威發覺一營中國軍隊迷路了，在胡康河谷以西的山岳業林裏尋路。</p>
<p>他們跑進了日軍的交錯小路綱裏，並且佔領了一塊小小的開拓地，他們以爲這塊開拓地就是他們的目標。史迪威偕着發愁的中國師長，兩國美國聯絡官和少數衛兵，自去尋找這個迷途的一營人。他還帶着他的著名的「小斧頭」。他眼睛裏嚴肅的神氣，表示他要使用他的「小斧頭」了。</p>
<p>他利用指南針，率領着他焦灼的一羣人，沿着象踏出的或喀欽人砍出來的叢林小路越過山嶺。前幾天經過這個區域的中國軍隊，在離一連日軍不過幾百碼的地方渦去，居然一點兒也不知道那兒有日軍。但是日本狙擊兵和伏兵並未發現這個老人（指史迪威）攪擾他們。他十分焦急。快到晚間時，他們找到了迷路的那營人，史迪威經過師長的同意，把營長換防下來讓他們休息休息，指給新營長如何到達他的目標。然後史迪威在一個避彈洞裏就寢。第二天早晨，這營中國軍際朝着正確的方向移動，史迪威　到師部。</p>
<p>生平事績</p>
<p>史迪威一九〇四年畢業於西點車事學院，曾在菲律濱美駐軍中服務；一九一七至一九一八年，參加歐洲大戰；一九二〇，二三在北平華北語言專校攻讀；一九二六至一九二九年在駐津美軍第十五步兵師服務；一九二九至于九三三年任美國駐華軍隊參謀長；一九四二至一九四四年任中印緬戰區美軍總司令，並任委員長參謀長。</p>
<p>史迪威所獲的勛章多不勝計，其重要的計有服務優良十字章，立功勛章等，但是他最喜歡拿到的却是戰鬥步兵勛章，爲了達到他的願望，美陸長柏德遜在他去世前二十四小時，把這勛章贈給他。</p>
<p>史迪威上將享年六十有三，在去世的時候，他的職位是美第六軍軍長。</p>

<p>王師亮將談</p>
<p>記者昨訪即將赴魯之王氏，據稱：最近曾與聯總行總當局及中共代表周恩來氏在滬會議數次，明日將隨萬恒輪北上，與當地中共代表再商談其他未獲決議之細節，同時並進行擴大烟台辦事處之工作範圍，兩星期後將返滬報告一切工作情况。王將軍又鄭重十聲明，渠在烟台工作原則計有兩點：（一）渠本人擔任烟台辦事處主任之職，乃該處工作之執行人，不願有何主張，只願依照聯總之決議與政策，執行行總之善救工作，一切接受行總之指示，行總交到多少救濟物資，渠即分配多少救濟物資，一本大公無私之精神，爲人民服務；（二）行總救濟物資之分配，並非無秩序之分配，一切救濟物資必需由行總與聯總工作人員擔任分配，並親見救濟物資交到人民手中，換言之，凡行總與聯總員不能到之地區救濟物資亦不運去，以期物資確能救濟需要救濟之人。王氏表示渠自擔任該處善救工作以來，即本此兩大原則執行任務，此次運往烟台辦事處之物資一千五百噸·包括食糧·麵粉·藥品·醫院器材。衣服等，爲造福人民起見　後扔不斷將物資遝往該區。記者詢以最近與周恩來氏所解決之工作問題爲何？據王氏告稱：（一）該辦事處之通訊問題—爲解決通訊方面之困難，烟台辦事處將設兩無綫電台，以便與外方通消息，一設在烟台，一設在臨沂；（二）幣制問題—中共控制區所用者爲北海幣，將來貨幣交換，以一比十五爲原則（即國幣十五元換北海幣一元），而行總工作人員之宿舍，伙食與傢供，則由當地供給；（三）行動問題—以前凡嚴軍事區，即爲禁地，現已由周恩來去函當地，指明除特別軍事區外，其他地區應使行總人員自由行動。以上三項問題，均爲最近取得協議，尚有內地運轍費用問題，頗爲嚴重，因碼頭工人運費，及自烟台運往其他地區之運費，其價甚昻，行總方面，自願負擔該項費用三分之二，而請求巾共方面負責三分之一，此種辦法，可行試辦，中共對於建議正在考慮中。與王氏同行者，有行總工作人員廿餘人，其中一部份人員</p>

<h3>古稀老人袁希洛　再向中共進忠言　致共黨諸領袖電托本報發表</h3>
<p>前以「拚老命」與「絕食」呼籲停止內戰之袁希洛老人，、於國慶日，又手繕其致中國共產黨諸領袖之代電，託本報發表，作最後之呼籲。茲節錄如下：</p>
<p>上海申報館轉中國共產當代表周恩來先生，並輔延安毛澤東先生，朱德生，暨共產軍諸將領，政治工作人員及黨員同胞均鑒：今値雙十佳節，願爲諸公進一言。計日寇投降已達一年。此一年中，若貴黨與國民政府間，能以國家爲重，民命爲重，不逞兵爭奪地盤，同心組織全國人民之政府，一切向建設復興方面着手，則此一年中，可增加國利民福多少，而竟不能！希洛不得已，再當大聲疾呼，以警醒貴黨。憶本歲一月，曾寫禮運大同一節兩紙，面託黃炎培老友，交周恩來先生，寄贈毛朱兩先生，請其讀誦。此大同一節，實爲救我人類世界之金科玉律，不但可救中國現時之內爭，亦可永息世界之戰爭。所謂大道，即天下爲公之道也。天下爲我人類之天下，決非在君主時代一姓一家之天下，更非在民主時代一黨及一領袖之天下，故一黨專政，若現在之蘇維埃共產政府一黨專政，實未明了天下爲公之要義。中國國民黨現旣決心還政於人民，不能再加以非議，常促其實現。中國共產黨常理解天下爲公之義，不能學蘇聯之一黨專政。所謂，選賢與能講信修睦者，實爲治國之要圖。今日中國之不治，實爲賢能未能任用。故用人必以賢能爲首提，不能以黨派爲前提，而互相爭奪位置。至國共兩黨之內戰，先後達十數年，皆不講信不修睦所致也。在抗日八年戰期中共產黨表面與政府共同抗日，而實際則擴張其地盤，而政府則一面須與日本作戰，一面又須防制共產軍之擴大，不能以全力對外，故日寇得以深入。李明揚一軍，在蘇北，前有日軍之進逼，後有新四軍之進攻，無地可立足，乃爲日人所俘，此明證也。而日寇投降後，國共兩方談判和平，停戰令歷下，而屢無効果，此不講信不修睦之爲害也。兵猶火也，不戢將自焚。希特勒，墨索里尼，東條英機，爲世界稱兵好戰之罪寇，今何在乎？可爲股鑑。乃苦戰八年間，國共兩黨貌合神離，令人太息。八年抗戰勝利之果，實賴美國之戰勝而得。今日本投降已一年餘矣，國共衝突亦一年餘矣，我國民所不滿於共產黨者，有數事：（一）專事破壞鐵路，將國家交通命脈斷送，物資不能交流，人民飢不得食，寒不得衣。（二）共軍與國軍衝突，力不敵而退，則破壞各河流堤岸，使洪水橫流，汨沒人民之田廬，致數十萬家數百萬人無食無住，以保護其一黨之武力，不仁已極（三）平均地權爲中山先生主義之一，須由政府商訂妥善辦法始可執行，共黨輕舉妄動，擅自分配土地，以共產方法使業主自耕農佃農皆受痛苦，而遊惰者反得其利。（四）鼓勵階級鬥爭淸算使社會秩序紛亂，良善者不能安居。（五）强迫人民表示坦白，侵犯思想自由，其手段更甚於秦始皇之偶語棄市，此何可哉？希洛深愛毛朱兩先生爲中國傑出之士，不忍以主義手段之不擇而失敗，再進忠告之言。毛朱兩先生當知洪秀全先生之歷史。洪秀全起兵金田，將驅逐胡虜，還我漢族之天下，乃爲曾左李所敗。至使淸祚延長七十年之壽命。我對洪先生非常尊敬之，而對曾左李則責備之，以其忘民族也。繼而硏究洪先生所以失敗之原因，則以其組織太平天國，對中國先聖先賢之禮敎一切不顧，對孔廟佛寺道院付之一炬。曾左李，皆儒生也，故起而反對，此戰遂成中國之禮敎聖戰。而洪先生之革命，光復漢土之雄圖，歷十七年而終至消失，甚可惜也。今我爲先生等計，亦覺有此危險。先生用中國共產之名義，以表示異於蘇維埃，然共產主義實發生於馬克斯，至列寧而行之於蘇俄。馬克斯學說不能如我孔子所述之大同之完美，則何必師馬而忘孔？若先生等不覺悟，而以兵力割據地盤，不與國人合作，其結果必爲外蒙古第二，此必然之結果也。周恩來先生批評美國對華政策，以爲美國助國民黨，我則以國共兩黨之衛突，至煩馬歇爾特使之調解，調解不成又煩司徒雷登大使之調解人令此七十以上之外人老人，爲中國弟兄不和而僕僕飛機汽車，爲國共兩黨恥，爲中國全體人民恥也。洛亦七十以上矣，願得飛機汽車供奔走而阻止中國之內戰，先此再警告中國共產黨諸位先生：希洛在四十年前，參加中山先生組織之同盟會，辛亥壬子之間，任組織中華民國臨時政府江蘇省代表，代行臨時參議員事。中山先生就大總統任時，洛手持大總統印，代表中華民國人民，授之中山先生。此後即退居敎育界，敎育中華民國國民，我非國民黨部各級黨部之委員，亦非國民黨以黨員而任院部之首長或委員，但我深參佛乘，具大無畏精神，有割肉喂虎之毅力，視中國同胞之　爲己饑，同胞之溺爲己溺。若　戰殃民者，不問爲國民黨共產黨，我皆反對。在國民政府未合洗改紙以前，我敬提辦法如下：（一）請毛澤東先生即日赴南京，與蔣主席携手，一面電邀　亥年組織中華民國之十七省代表，現在人仳者（曾充在兆銘僞政府之漢奸不在邀請之列）到京，參加會議。再由國民政府電邀　黨無派之父老十人進京參加會議，此十人，中共民盟得提出各一人。馬特使司徒大使聘請爲此會議之顧問，由此會議，解決國事，即日請蔣主席電令停止進攻張家口。毛澤東先生電令共軍退出張家口外三十里，蘇北共軍退至蘇魯交界處六十里之區域，以免衝突。中華民國　　民袁希洛。佳，代電。</p>
<p>「荷印」是政治上的一個區劃，不是純地理的名稱。它在</p>
<p>社諭</p>
<h3>荷印僑胞宣慰</h3>
<p>「荷印」是政治上的一個區　，不是純地理的名稱。它在地理上是東印度羣島的一部份。荷自一五九六年初次入爪哇後逐漸擴展，至一六〇九年，脫離西班牙獨立爲共和國，即建立立吧城爲他們政治中樞。一六〇二年，荷蘭東印度公司成立，荷印帝國由此植共基。從那時起，荷人是成功了，華僑是失敗了！報載我國派赴爪哇特使李迪俊氏十一日甫抵新加坡，不日將赴荷印。今天李特使的宣慰荷印僑胞，就是華僑失敗的最顯明的實證。</p>
<p>荷印的僑胞，豈但失敗而已，節直是「人爲刀俎，我爲魚肉」，舊創未愈，新痛疊來。請瞧一八八六年（光緒十二年）粵督張之洞的加拉巴七萬餘僑胞痛苦的報告，請瞧一九〇一年（光緒二十七年）荷奧公使呂海寰上書痛言荷屬虐待僑胞的慘狀。一七四〇年荷人正式下令屠殺吾僑，巴城火光燭天，哭聲遍野，老幼婦孺咸膏荷人斧　，血流所被，河水爲亦，死者萬餘，史稱「紅河之役」，慘絕人寰！</p>
<p>抗戰勝利，我二百萬的荷印骨肉仍陷於水深火熱之中。例如（一）聯車與印尼人泗水衝突，炸死僑胞逾千，無家可歸者萬五，（二）芝巴德被聯軍轟炸，吾僑殉難者數百；（三）兩方拉鋸戰時，即變膠漢一處，吾僑失蹤者數百；（四）巴東全體僑胞被圍，困苦　連，　棉蘭二萬餘僑民半年內被焚刦六百二十一起；（六）比卡錫華僑難民三千三百餘不堪安居；（七）大規模屠殺坦其降的慘案血瀋未乾，巴根慘案又相繼而至，僑胞因自衛而死者已有二百人。此外則經商的華僑受變重拙殘，一而印尼政府提高進出口稅至驚人程度，一面荷印政府截留吾僑商船四十艘，復枸禁船員加以凌辱，損失達國幣七十萬元以上。</p>
<p>祖國忍不住了，僑務委員會自去年急到如今，才急出了一個荷印宣慰團。這項組織，由僑委會。外交部·和海外部等五代表構成。我們於李特使出發以後，又聽得有此宣慰之舉，不得不先以數言欲告。構成宣慰團的各份子要健全組織，行動一致，切忌個人的單獨活動。中國應該是「萬乘之國」出國代表必須有「萬乘」的氣槪。所貴乎僑務家外交家者，是眼光要放在遠處與將來。王安石對曾子固云：「讀經而已，則不足以知經」，意即須多讀他書以知經。辦僑務，辦外交，更應如是，更要在問題外找尋問題，然後可以解決問題。</p>
<p>對荷印史地·政治·經濟·社會·民族，尤其是宗敎，代表們須有澈頭澈尾的明白。此去除對我們連理枝的海外黃帝子帝寄以溫暖的宣慰外，還該帶些敎育給他們，更要鼓勵他們，提醒他們。正義總是最後勝利的。天下事，「行有不得者，反求諸己」，對荷人，對印尼人，乃至對有關係的第三國人，該着實用一番工夫，只知說一聲「中立」，究在還嫌不够。</p>
<p>我們要敬告荷人，你們統治了荷印三百年，迄今留着百分之九十的文盲在溢塊沃土上，這是大恥辱。一九一八年創設的國民參議會（Voksraad）雖於一九二二年和一九二五年兩度改善，可是代表的階層不普遍，權限太狹，這是火失策。一般人民生活太苦，終年徉徊在饑饉綫上，在你們　斷手中所得的工資每週僅五角至一元一角五分，每人侮日平均收入祇二分錢，這是大禍根，用血腥手段加害華僑，身受法西斯蹂躪的你們，靠着中國抗戰，盟軍勝利，你們又回到東方來，拿法西斯所對付你們的暴行，來對付有功你們的盟友中國僑胞，這更是大卑劣！世界正在變，你們也該變變了！你們不變，人家會逼你們變的。我們奉勸荷印政府，還是聰明點，讓久年被壓迫的人們透一口氣，少吃些苦頭，免得他們走上岔路，兩敗俱傷。</p>
<p>同時，我們要忠告印尼人幾句話：你們在三百年內已掀起七十餘次反荷運動，從年青人的Bocdi　Octomo愛國起迭經左翼的同敎同盟宗敎性的政治的革新運動，PFB工會的大罷工，共產黨的不合作，一直到全國印尼黨（PNI）眞正民族主義運動，我們無時不在懷念中。扶助弱小民族，是孫中山先生遣敎所定的國策，世界上如果有眞能同情你們帮助你們的，就該是中國。你們有七三五二六七方哩肥沃土地，等於法，意，阿和瑞典合起來的面積；六千七百萬人口中你們佔到百分之九七，你們有一三〇種種族，二五種文字，二五〇種土話，應加緊團結，加緊統一，加緊信任你們兄弟之邦的中國。</p>
<p>華僑在荷印是帮助當地繁榮的。他們赤手空拳、全無國家武力作後盾，更絲毫沒有侵佔的意味。他們都是受到中國體就的王道文化的洗禮，是最仁愛者，是最和平者，「四海之內皆兄弟也」，是華僑的做人之道。在大戰期間，敵人雖用惡意的挑撥，毒素的宣傳，說中國人是「侵略者」「侵略者」，但僑胞們應該時時與印尼人接觸，用鐵的事實來證明，究竟誰是霸者，誰是侵略者。僑胞們不能僅僅以「中立」爲口實，而避開現實，必須針對荷印常前的問題，勸告印尼人要有是非，要分友敵，千萬勿中敵人的計！宣慰團必須爲僑胞們提醒印尼人：要知世界上暴亂無謀的屠夫決不能殺出天下來的！印尼人的同情，在求之於純潔的華僑，這是最大的憾事！</p>
<h3>秋涼病又多</h3>
<p>秋來了，天氣突然凉起來，霍亂固然退，瘧疾傷寒和感冒等病，及時而至。生老病死，人生四大苦難，病是介乎生與死中間的一關，雖未必最嚴重，但在精神上和肉體上，究竟受着打擊。</p>
<p>據近日報載，患白喉者似乎特別多，炎熟已退，嚴寒未來，這種溫度，應是人生最舒適的天氣，却不料這種不熱不冷的氣候也適宜於病菌的繁殖。我們應當特別在這種適宜的天氣中，加意保護着體氣康健。</p>
<p>現在生活高漲得駭人，病是更生不起了！重病，請醫生出診，已到了每次要十萬元的驚人診費；須待至下午五時以後，有的醫生的出診費才可减爲減中次五萬元，但患急病的人，片刻間即有生命之虞，何能從容待至黃昏時候？這還是診費而已，此外尚有手續費，藥費，和醫生車夫的小費，病人實難負荷。門診固稍便宜，普通的每次一萬元，可是短短一個上午，在名醫的小小診所中擠滿了許多病人，還有出額外門診費拔號的，於是無錢的患重病和急病的人，只好奄奄待斃。市立公立醫院，取費遠較私人　生爲康，而以上海人口如此衆多，區域如此龐大，公家事業經濟又甚拮据，勢不能爲全市病民作普通的服務。在這種情况之下，每一個在上海患病的人，莫不深深地呌苦。</p>
<p>行醫辦以救世，醫師之所以受人尊敬，厥在其抱有濟世救人崇高的宏願。不料戰爭影響，這些都談不到了。試計算出診每次十萬的醫費，一個稍有地位的醫師，一個月的收人，將比一國主席的月俸，高出不知多少倍？此外門診有收入，配樂有收入，手續有收入，其一個月收入的豐厚，常可驚人。行醫至此，成爲私人的發財工具。此種現象，於社會爲害之烈，於個人受痛之深，實難言喩，無怪英國工黨政府也主張醫藥改　國營了。</p>
<p>常今百物有限制，米有限價，油有限價，黃金有拋售，美鈔可禁止交易，甚至黃包車三輪車的車費，不久以前也都公布了一個標準。但對於人命關天的醫費，却任若干醫師任意勒索，未聞衛生當局有一言，市政當局有一令，爲全市的病民謀一錢的生機。醫生及其家屬當然也要生活，這是天經地義，可是醫生的工作，也不能紙是念茲在茲的弄錢。要發財，索性痛痛快快做生意，至於醫生，則在生活以外，另有其神聖的責任。</p>
<p>我們要求衛生當局，立即澈底調查全市醫生的取費情形，從而以最迅速的方法，予以合理的限制。人生血肉之軀，誰能保終年無病？一個人於有病時的請醫服藥，其需要，比無病時的吃飯，似更迫切，其問貧病交迫之苦，恐更非豐衣足食的朋友所能明瞭其萬一。市政當局現似應於一切措置漸上軌道的今天，對此問題予以注意。</p>
<p>我們絕對沒有攻擊任何醫師的意思。論理，醫師工作，危險而辛苦，收取診金，義所當取。可是我們爲了全市市民的康健計，却必須反對少數貪財好利醫德墮毀的不良醫師，籍行醫爲其私人發財的利器。當此深秋來臨，幾乎每個人的家中小孩，妻子，或自己，或其他家人，大槪輕輕重重的，對於秋病又有一種新的經騐。無論診費，藥費，或手續費，無一不是薪水階級的最大的悲哀。今天多數人已到臨了生不能生，死不能死甚至病也不能病的邊緣，上海社會中呈現出一個很大很嚴重的問題。這個問題，市政當局應盡其可能設法解決，使貧病的市民减少一些痛苦。</p>

<h3>武丹金三縣邊境匪熾　自姨隊槍械被繳　並綁走隊員八名悉加殘殺</h3>
<p>〔木報武進訊〕武進居京滬綫的巾心地帶，北枕長江，西南臨滆湖，與丹陽金壇接壤，東南瀕太湖，一片平原，禾黍盈野，本爲江南最富庶的魚米之鄉，可是經八年來敵僞蹂躪，兵匪擾亂，元氣斵傷殆盡，尤其是武丹金交界處，地勢複雜，管轄不統一，近竟形成股匪結集的窠巢，慘殺暴行，層出不窮。　國慶日的前一天，深夜十二時，在武進距城西南四十餘里二區厚圩鎭，又發生一件股匪襲擊自衛隊繳槍的案子，結果自衛隊的槍全部被繳，並死傷隊員十一名之多，自上月二十日與厚圩鄰近九區東安鎭自衛隊槍械全部被匪繳去後，人心已感惶惶，此案再起，震動遐邇，鄕區治安，益成問題，鄕區民衆人人感自危，苟不及時淸剿，則星星之火，勢將燎原，後患殊堪憂。</p>
<p>深夜突襲</p>
<p>厚圩爲武進西南一大市鎭，惟地臨滆湖，西通丹金，素爲股匪山沒之所，本年四月廿六日認，該鎮自衛隊曾一度被匪繳去長短一槍五支，隊員王金生中槍三處，事隔五月，兇案始終未能破獲，不料一波未平，一波又起，二次繳槍又突然發生，緣該二區欽和，厚圩，徐右，錦鳳四鄉組聯合自衛隊，縣派朱聞瑜負責督練，有步槍二十五支，輕機槍一挺。短槍五支，實力相常雄厚，駐防厚圩鎭，本月九日深夜十二時，自衛隊哨兵初發見一小孩，自遠而來，形跡可疑，當予帶隊偵詢，待回出時，忽槍聲四起，匪首莊子明（本地人）率領股匪五六十人分三路蜂湧向自衛隊急襲，自衛隊員倉卒應戰，一時槍聲大作，彈如雨飛，激戰約一小時，隊員張慶海楊福因受重傷，江全根殉職，股匪亦死四人受傷四五人，無奈因自衛隊彈盡，無以爲戰，股匪乘勢包圍，强迫繳械，當被繳去步槍二十二支，機槍一梃，快機二支，並將全隊所有裝備用具，悉數檢集一起，舉火焚毁，臨去除將匪屍及傷匪担走外，並架走隊附戴傳勳，段吉元，機槍手楊振華，隊員余龍生，石坤生，余鳳生等八名，至離鎭西南二里餘之黃泥墩傅宗祠內，一一加以殘殺，身目異處，血肉換糊，手段酷辣，慘不忍睹。事後，二區區公所即將經過情形，飛報縣府，並以督練員朱聞瑜是晚離隊家居，有失戰守，一併　　法辦，縣府據報後，當分向首都衛戌司令部無錫指揮所，及省保安司令部，暨二區專員公署，當丹揚聯防指揮所等機關呈報，聽候處理。</p>

<p>我們這一羣，都是浦東的居民而每天必須到上海工作的，每天晨晚二次的路程，全仗市輪渡往還，然自十月一日夏令時刻撤消後，輪渡公司爲聯絡上川路火車班起見，將行船時刻變更，較前相差殊甚，而早晨自吳淞到上海須遲至九時，必誤工作時刻。頃閱貴報載有輪渡公司新修竣「江蘇」一輪，亦將加入淞滬綫行駛，讀之不勝欣慰。故請偕一角披露苦衷，希輪渡公司能採納愚見，加駛早班，俾於八時左右抵申實爲公便。（東溝及慶寗寺一羣居民）</p>
<p>不合理加租之質詢</p>
<p>（一）我是三十四年四月間，租得謝姓亭子間一間，每月租金三百元，至本年三月間，曾接房東通知云：房價要增加了，惟當特沒有言明增加若干，直至本年九月，始言自三月份起，每月增爲七千元，依照倍計爲廿五倍左右。若論物價高漲，房租增加，理所應然，惟須依照公平市價，方爲合理。這市參議會，議決房價無一增加必要，並取締二房東額外需索，送呈市政府核辦聲中，該二房東竟漲至廿五倍之數，是否合理？九月份追征三月份起同加廿五倍，更屬無理。同里房屋，不論優劣，每幢之內，有的增加七十倍，有的六十倍，有的是十六七倍等等，是吾合法？——綜上二點，祈請賢明常局注意有妥善辦法。</p>

<h3>和會通過對匈和約　決定如開多瑙河會議</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦十三日廣播：巴黎和會已定十五日晚閉幕。　　〔聯合社巴黎十三日電〕和會昨晚已將匈牙利和的全部討論完畢，定於下週一開始討論芬蘭和約。昨晚表決通過之匈牙利和的條款，亦規定多瑙河航行自由，與羅馬尼亞及保加利亞和的相同。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社十三日電〕和會昨日舉行全體會議，檢討對匈和的時，法國提議召集四强及多瑙河流域各國舉行國際會議，討論多瑙河自由航運問題，當經以三分之二多數通過。同時對匈和的大部份政治與領土條款，均未經討論迅速通過。經濟條款方面，關於蘇聯有權管理匈境內德國奮有資產一條，經全塲一致通過。</p>
<p>〔聯合社巴黎十二日電〕和會全會今日討論匈牙利對蘇聯捷克及南斯拉夫三國賠款條款，其中規定總額爲三億美元，美國提議减爲二億美元，遭十二票對二票否決，仍維持原議，附和美國主張者僅加拿大，另有七國棄權。和會同時通過其他條款，規定匈牙利與捷克談判捷境二十萬匈牙利少數民族撤退閒題，匈牙利並以多瑙河岸附近三城割讓捷克，以擴大勃拉蒂斯伐省。最後通過軍事條款，限制匈陸軍爲六萬五千名，空軍限制戰鬥機七十架，運輸機二十架，空軍人員五千名。大會至今日爲止，已結束第十一星期之工作，在休會以前尚餘四次會議，十三日星期日休會，十四日將舉行會談三次，通過芬蘭和的，十五日舉行閉幕禮，以上各次會議均由法總統兼外長皮杜爾主席。</p>
<h3>組織國際軍隊　蘇聯未曾拒絕</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社成功湖十三日電〕據聯合國軍事參謀會義法國某代表談稱；蘇聯對於設立國際警衛軍一事，並未如美國若干報紙所謂完全拒絕參加。蘇代表團曾以備忘錄送達聯合國參謀會議，聲明蘇聯拒絕宣佈其參加國際警備軍之軍隊數額，須俟將來國際確實發生危機，需要此項軍隊干涉時，始有考慮之餘地。蘇聯並未完全拒絕中，美，英，法所擬之計劃，於此可獲證明。聞四國業已供給參謀會議今後工作之各項必要之情報，蘇聯則僅供給其第一部份情報，對於蘇方調出之軍隊及其分配辦法，並未有所表示。但蘇代表團與其他各國代表團間時時舉行談判，或有成立妥協可能云。</p>

<h3>蘇聯推行五年計劃　積極準備新戰爭　前蘇金屬廠長在英報撰文</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦十三日電〕兩年前在美國宣告脫離蘇聯共黨之克拉夫欽哥，在倫敦之星期日報紙「世界新聞」撰文，指責史達林盡力準備在下一代內發動新戰爭。克氏原係蘇聯金屬廠之廠長兼總工程師，赴美係爲定購貨物，最近渠並出版「自由乃余之選擇」一書。渠今日在報端發表之文有謂：史達林不但相信有新戰爭之威脅，且其政府復盡力準備此一戰爭，其整個外交內政政策，可以證實此說。</p>
<p>完成原子武備　僅屬時日問題</p>
<p>蘇聯之第四期五年計劃，目的在增加防禦力量，以最新式之科學技術配備紅軍，預定至一九五〇年，使戰其機械生產量增加五倍之多。除軍火部外，復設立專部，開始建立陸海軍工廠，史達林得以完成原子武備，殆屬毫無疑義。凡此種種，將保衛蘇聯以抗何人，渠不以國帑解除人民戰後疾苦，反使其更趨凋敝，動機何在？史達林以目前之戰爭空氣，歸責他人，採用希特勒之方法，以己之所爲，反責英美，呼喊英美帝國主義有對蘇威脅新戰爭者，豈非克林姆宮內之政治賭徒乎？</p>
<p>採用希魔方法　求達政治目標</p>
<p>蘇聯政府此項政策之目的，在於（一）恐嚇盟邦從事神經戰，以獲得最大限度之政治及軍事讓步；（一）向本國人民證實其大規模擴軍計劃之需要，（三）使蘇聯軍隊深信確有保持武裝之必要。史達林口與心違，言與行背，目的在欺騙西方國家，渠掩飾其在德國之政治及軍事目標，以欺騙輿論。渠深知目前正進行在政治上佔有德國之爭奪戰，其結果足以影響其在歐洲權勢之增减，同時在蘇聯國內烏克蘭，莫斯科，列寧格勒各處，則從事大規模之肅淸運動，凡有同情西方，忽略馬克斯主義或其個人學說之嫌疑者，悉在肅淸之列。史達林深知原子彈乃重要武器，任何軍事秘密決不可使史達林知道，否則其世界革命之目的，眞可實現矣。</p>
<p>共產國際解散　完全一種煙幕</p>
<p>共產黨國際之解散，完全一種烟幕，政治局之政策與共產國國際完全相同。法國之陶萊士及馬蒂，羅馬尼亞之保格·匈牙利之阿諾茜·義大利之埃柯里，保加利亞之狄密特洛夫及柯拉洛夫·德國之畢克諸人，均在實行政治局之政策，彼等乃其全權代表，聽其指揮，西方國家於考慮相互間及對蘇之關係時，應勿忘此一事實，即史達林目光中今日之英格蘭及其社會改革之積極推進，爲其主義上及政治上之第一號敵人。英美應捐棄私見，共同爲大西洋憲草之原則奮鬥，成爲他國政府及人民精神上之支持。</p>
<h3>回盟決議　轉達印督</h3>

<h3>美籌設火箭實驗區　英亦進行秘密試驗　最遠射程可越半個澳洲</h3>
<p>〔聯合社南遠科泰州揚頓十二一日電〕本州共和黨參議員戈納今日談稱：頃接華盛頓電話，藉悉政府正擬設一實騐區，雇用三萬六千人，硏究火箭炸彈，超音連飛機及原子能之用度。測量隊正在踏勘實騐區地址。軍事當局將於明春向國會要求撥款進行，實騐區廣的五十方哩，需用大量電力。</p>
<p>〔中央社倫敦十二日合衆電）供應部本日聲稱：由艾維茲中將領導之人員十人，已被選以試騐秘密火箭武器，其射程爲全球最遠者，將越過半個澳洲，而進入太平洋。供應部預計：此一工作初步將耗費五千萬美元，一年後又將耗費一千二百萬美元。</p>
<h3>日企圖取得琉球　政界人士私相授受秘密文件　深信美蘇間必發生戰爭</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社東京十二日電〕日政界人士現正以一駭人聽聞之文件私相授受，全文共計七頁，內容在說明日本對將來對日和會之各項目標，該項文件並未擬定任何確切之條款，僅揭櫫若干指導原則，俾使日本出席和會之代表團得有所遵循。此項文件提議在對日和約草案之緒言中，插入兩項特別條款：（一）譴責作戰權，以示日本其有和平意向，（二）承認一切種族之平等。日本在凡爾賽和會前，即一度主張稱族平等；至於領土問題，日本擬取得琉球羣島（冲繩島即係其中之一）之託管權，良以該羣島不論在傳統上，種族上及文化上，均與日本有密切關係故也。關於千島列島，並未提出任何建議，僅謂在蘇聯領海內之捕魚權問題，實需要日本外交家運用一切手腕云。日政界人士對此文件反響不一；但多數均認爲在國際條約中插入譴責作戰權之條款，未免欠妥。某政界要人語本社記者稱：吾人僅在憲法中插入譴責作戰之條款已足，因美蘇之間，日後必將發生戰爭，故者人如在條約巾插入此等條款實無意義可言。一般政界人士對於稱族平等問題亦認爲不妥，蘇聯若贊成此項理論，則其他各國勢將羣起反對，其結果足使蘇聯在表面上陽爲亞洲各民族之保護者，而實爲遠東擴張其勢力。日政治家一致贊成日本至少能取得琉球羣島，而將冲繩島留與美國，作爲軍略上之基地。</p>
<h3>哥倫布紀念日　弗朗哥演說</h3>

<h3>日本之正常與義會（上）</h3>
<p>〔本報東京特派員十二日專電〕日本議會即將閉幕，地方選舉迫在目前，日政界逐漸活躍，日人所謂政治季節即將開始。最近日政界引人注月之處，爲保守勢力大同團結具體事實之表現，自由。進步兩黨之合併運動，與于社會黨之右傾，政黨之任務在維持旣成的政治秩序，並擁護旣得之權利義務，代表一個旣成勢力之社會集團。日本社會之基本形態是資本主義；日本政治之根本使命即在維持資本主義之發展；但日本資本主義無法克服原有的封鎖生產關係，自</p>
<p>明治維新以來，即與軍國主義密切接洽，而對鎖性日益强大。日本雖曾實行議會政治，實則並未充分發達，常受軍國主義限制；故旣成政黨的政策多動搖不定，未能完成自身所負歷史使命，即未能完成資本主義階段中之民主革命。自由黨原負之歷史任務，應爲民主主義自由的實現，自由黨雖曾宣言自由乃人之天性，保持自由乃人類之大道；但自由黨關於國體之主張，則公然支持天皇制之存在，議會審議憲法</p>
<p>議會審議憲法時，與進步黨一致主張：應在憲法中規定天皇爲元首，換言之，主權之所在應屬於天皇。自由黨雖曾偽裝民主，於去年十一月緊急政策聲明書中主張應嚴厲制裁戰犯，而該黨前任總裁鳩山一郞即在麥帥肅淸令之列，故不得不推出總裁以作後盾。日憲政專家懌者尾崎行雄於議會開幕時，對自山黨此舉曾加痛駡，認爲近於發在，在現在一股民衆要求實現政黨制度之呼聲中，自由黨居然拉一在議會中未佔一席之</p>
<p>官僚出任總裁，可見日本旣成政黨之無節操可言，充分表示日本政治之封鎖性。至於進步黨不過是戰時大政黨贊會與日本政治會之別名，構成份子多係　政友會及民政黨人物。在政友會中，太有中島派中島知之平，及久原派久原房之助兡。過去民政黨與政友黨本來勢不兩立，惟日政黨史中兩派對立之政黨，互推萍閥爲黨魁而合併之事實屢見不鮮。例如大隈之改進黨，與坂垣之自由黨。自由黨與伊藤博文合作</p>
<p>乃成立政友會，改進黨則投入桂太郞門下，組成同志會，該會后身即民政黨。此二政黨均因不能純粹以民黨立塲掌握政黨，乃在中途變節。又例如政友會，曾以官閥軍閥之對立，伊藤博文·西園寺公。望原敬。高橋明淸。田中義一。犬義毅·鈴木喜三郞爲掌魁，而握得政權。民政黨則曾擁桂太郞·加藤·瞳明若櫬禮次郞·濱口拭幸·町出忠治等爲黨魁·而執政。因之，日本民主主義與議會政治多因政黨與藩閥官閥妥協，而入歪曲路綫。進步黨推幣原爲自由黨魁，不過是日本封鎖政治</p>
<p>日本封鎖政治史的搨煆，進步黨推幣原爲黨魁之目的　，在利用幣原之官僚地位，俾便握得政權；但此舉不幸而告失敗，乃轉而與自由黨採取合作形式，向吉田內閣推薦閣員，作吉田之與黨，故吉田內閣有第二幣原內閣之稱也。可謂支持吉田內閣之政黨，其主體實係進步黨，而非自由黨，因吉田內閣本質</p>
<p>吉田內閣本質係　一官僚內閣，而非一政黨內閣。軍國主義時代日本迎合軍閥，任其橫行者，即此等進步黨前身之政客。歷史上事實明示我人，東三省事件發生時，幣原在當時民政黨內閣中身任外相，中日戰爭發生前一年，即一九三五年時，民政黨與政友會之中島派及久原派，均願解散自己之政黨，參加軍部與官僚之法西斯體制。在廣田內閣時代，此輩政客曾與官僚勾結，贊成現役軍人出任大臣。在近衛內閣實行新體制政治運動時，此輩政客對軍部之獨裁政治，在議會中拍手盛贊，且均曾參加侵略中國計劃</p>
<p>侵略中國計劃。自由黨總務長　橋渡，戰時曾在北平經營北平飯店，發了一筆橫財。據稱：自由黨費大部份係由渠供給，自由黨前任總裁鳩山一郞於一九三三年文相任內，對言論大事壓迫，會將反對軍訓之京都帝大敎授隴川幸辰免職。自由進步兩黨所代表之社會集團，及其所標榜之政策，並無懸殊，皆在於國體之護持；換言之，即維持並擁護旣成勢力之利益，且吉田內閣成立時，得力於幣原之處不少。吉田之組閣參謀，即由幣原親信前國務相石黑武重擔任，閣內有進步黨之河合良成一（厚相），幣原　市（國務相），齋藤隆夫（國務相），及一松定吉（遞相）。吉田內閣之出現，可謂自由進步</p>
<p>兩黨黑市交易之結果。吉田內閣所代表之社會集團，與進步黨所代表者完全一樣，仍係重臣官僚與樞府勢力爲後盾。官僚勢力中心人物如：伊澤·多喜欲·松平恒雄·鈴木貫太郞·岡田啓介·米內光政·三土忠造·若櫬禮决郞·池田成彬及其岳丈牧野伸願等，渠等雖係東條派，在戰時仍爲投機份子。</p>

<h3>南市又一被殺女　發現於滬車營車站前　情形與兩週前引綫弄慘案彷彿　揣測係女後敝斃警局懸賞嚴</h3>
<p>〔本報訊」上月廿四日，南市引綫弄內曾發生謀殺女屍案一起，迄不破案。不料爲日無多，昨又發生一類同之慘案，詳情誌决。</p>
<p>南市滬軍營車站前路，即前舊南區救火會原址荒塲上，於昨晨七時許，忽發現一女子被殺事件。該女屍仰臥於草坪上。一時聞訊前往觀看者，紛至沓來。滬軍營警察派出所警士宋金潮發現後，即據情轉報蓬萊警局。立由姚分局長親偕刑事股長姚元龍率股員吳志鵬·警長張書生·童伯榮等馳往查勘。見被害之女子年僅廿四五歲，姿色平庸，頭東脚西，大部份臉上發現靑紫色，短發蓬亂，口流白沫，身穿花洋布格子旗袍，內襯白色絲汗衫，紅色條子洋布短袴，肉色絲襪。滿面泥跡斑斑，足上一皮鞋巳不知去向，尚有一皮鞋拋擲於距離屍體約三十碼之電綫桿旁，內燙有德昌隆鞋號字樣。屍體頸項間，圍有小型藍手帕一方，外又有一黑色白點類似包袱之網巾一方綑紮。經警員審視良久，發現左手無名指上有戒指痕跡，惟戒子已失所在。旗袍上，兩鈕扣解開，白汗衫翻起，乳房外露。陰部兩旁有足踢傷印。在屍旁有深凹三四寸之泥穴，據一般推測，或係生前被姦汚後，加以殺害。其殺害方法，或先將女之面部强撳入泥中，將其悶斃，而後又故意在死者頸項繫以手帕。又可斷定死者所戴之戒指，事後爲兇手所刧去。依據以上之檢騐與判斷，此案係屬先行姦汚，然後害死，再行搶刧財物無疑。惟以死者身畔，並無國民身份證，故其姓名住址無法查悉。迄昨晚止，尚無家屬前往警局領認屍體。嗣總局方面據報，立由刑事警察處派員攝取照相，並捺死者手印，以備家屬認領。午後屍體舁送同仁輔元堂，定今晨報請法院勘騐。分局長姚啓洪返局後，因二旬中在轄境內運續發生離奇女屍案兩起，乃偕姚股長召集刑事股警員等，嚴諭偵緝，限日破案。並懸巨額賞金，俾購綫索，務獲兇犯歸案究辦。</p>

<h3>兩路無票軍人乘車日益增多　重新規定辦法　嚴禁強行佔座　定今日起正式實行</h3>
<p>據兩路局消息最近軍人無票乘車，日益增多雖經擬定免費乘軍辦法，及規定無票軍人乘車之班次，但仍有一部份軍人，不遵守定章乘軍，甚至京滬綫凱旋。太湖號，滬杭綫金陵·西湖號等對號車，亦多强行佔座，因是料紛隨時發生，影響行車秩序及旅客安全頗鉅，以致脫班誤點，日有所聞。據最近統計：京滬綫無票軍人，平均每日有四千五百人左右，最多時達五千五百人，滬杭綫每日計七百人左右，最多時達一千六百人，佔兩路全部旅客總數十分之一，影響路局庫收甚鉅，此項數字，並未包括按章乘軍之無票軍人。日前陸軍總司令官湯恩伯將軍來滬時，該局負責人，曾往趨謁，詳爲報告，當承湯將軍面允設法取締。該局爲便利無票軍人乘車起見，除對乘車辦法考慮簡化外，並改訂規定乘坐之車次爲：京滬綫五十一至五十四及五七，五八次，滬杭綫之四一，四二，六一，六二，六七，六八次所掛之「軍人乘坐車」准許現役軍人，憑差假證，經駐站憲兵簽證後，得免費乘坐。此外京滬綫之第五次至十二次車（除臥舖）七三次至八十次車，滬杭綫二三，二五，二六，九二，九四次車，特准軍人持恁甲種車照或差假證，現款購買「軍人半價票」乘坐，除上項各次列車外，絕對嚴禁無票軍人佔座，上項辦法，定今日起正式實行。</p>

<p>中央電影攝影塲，勝利後第一部劇情影片「忠義之家」吳永剛編導，劉瓊秦怡主演，在上海大光明戲院，賣座一月，塲場客滿，於此外片充斥吾國市塲之際，無疑與國產影片極大鼓舞。該塲總負責人羅學濂正積極籌劃，令各製片廠，加緊製片工作。現將各廠近况報導於後：「中電」第一廠設於上海天通菴路，由裘逸葦任廠長，以攝製新聞片，紀錄片爲主要工作。該廠技術設備最佳，由唐煌致力於新聞片，紀錄片之編輯，每月出產新聞片紀錄片約六本。已完成者有紀錄片」農爲邦本』，「活潑的初夏」，「廬山眞面目」，「蔣主席畫傳」，「雛鷹」，「天山南北」等。編號新聞片已由一二〇出至一四九號之多。其中尤以「日本投降典禮」，「蔣主席返京」，「審判陳逆公博」，「審判陳璧君褚民誼」，「凱旋還都」，「湘災」等特號新聞最富有歷史價値。一般編號新聞中又特編入「上海之窗」，以上海市之活動爲材料，形形色色，包羅萬象。最近又計劃新聞片與紀錄片混合編輯之雜誌電影，計有「時代生活」，「歐風美雨」等。現該廠亦正在增加設備，拍攝劇情長片。正由廠長裘逸葦，編導唐煌積極推行。預計半年內完成劇情片二部至三部。「中電」第二廠設於上海建國西路，由徐蘇靈任廠長。除已出「忠義之家」外，新片「遙遠的愛」（陳鯉庭編導，趙丹秦怡主演），和「驚飛人間」，（方沛霖編導，歐陽飛鶯主演、）下月底可以全部兀成。正在積極籌劃拍攝中之影片，有（一）「人與鼠」（吳永剛編導，金　劉瓊主演）。（二）「衣錦還鄉』（趙丹顯而已編導，路明主演）。（三）「草野忠魂」（馬徐　邦編導，袁如梅主演）。（四）「　樓　夢」（徐昌霖　　丹編導，路明主演）。（五）「某夫人」（六）徐蘇靈編導，舒繡文主演）。（六）『紫金城之月』，（方沛霖編導）。「中電」第三廠設於北平，由徐昻千任廠長，該廠除攝製劇情片外，兼攝新聞片紀錄片。已完成新聞片紀錄片，如「北平受降典禮」，「蔣主席抵平」，「遣送日俘」等均逐時攝製，現已出至第十四號。每號一兩本，（每本的千尺左右）不等。劇情片除「聖城記」，（沈學編導，白楊謝添主演），最近即可完成外，屠光啓編導之「歸去來兮」，近已開拍。在準備中者，有沈浮編導的「一生難忘」，吳永剛編導的「慈母頌」，張駿祥編導的「北京人」，華北影壇亦漸入繁榮時期矣。</p>
<h3>荒蕪·寂寞·淒涼　刦後的「新上海」　破碎了的當年建設之夢　希望大家努力重行綴補起來</h3>
<p>「本報特寫〕建設新上海，曾是常年一個美麗的夢。到了夢的影子剛在地面上實現時，敵人的砲火把它炸碎了。昨日下午，秋光正好，記者等驅車往尋這破碎的夢，但景物已非，昔日的風光，無論如何也綴補不全了。</p>
<p>一個美國小兵，孤獨地坐在「上海特別市政府」大厦後面的草坪上，呆望着　下的雕刻花紋，像是出神了。再過去一段路，有幾個我們的弟兄們，望着這位異邦的同志，充滿了興趣和驚奇。他們就住在這大厦內，生活在這內部毀損，玻窗破碎的建築裏，他們不懂，這有甚麽好看的呢？</p>
<p>記者走近美國小兵身傍時，他轉過頭來招呼，說是「美極了！」他原是硏究室內裝飾的，對於這純東方的花紋，有極深的愛好。但他把這座昔日的市府誤認爲廟宇。記者告訴他之後，他問道：「這樣美的建築，爲甚麼不修修好？」記者說：「那是需要很多錢的。」但記者也很懷疑，租界收復了的今天，人們是不是還有心情綴補這破碎的夢呢？</p>
<p>市博物館是過去市府文化建設的一大成就。成立以後，廣爲收藏，企圖在這裏保存下人類活動的遺痕。今日所留下的，僅是破毀的遺痕。不僅遭到敵人的破壞，也有自己人的手留下的兇跡。勝利以來，輾轉接收，有的部隊因爲柴薪缺乏，就在室內砍伐。昔日人們伐木營屋，今日大家砍屋生火，時代就是這樣的在進步嗎？</p>
<p>現在這裏樓下住着輪汽二團第七連的官兵，他們雖盡最大的力量修理，但限於經費，也修理不出頭緒來。樓上都空着，荒廢寂靜，如同踏進了偵探小說中的怪屋。凄凉中，似聞屋角柱側有哭泣之聲。</p>
<p>體育館已經封鎖了。裏面堆藏着輕輜重火藥。四面的大門，不是攔着鐵絲網，就是站着衛兵。</p>
<p>但市立醫院却在積極的活動中，現在是軍政部上海陸軍醫院和軍醫學校。過去敵人的陸軍醫院也在這裏，他們增添了許多房屋和設備。我們接收之後，又加以改進。同時還有許多新計劃在積極實施呢！</p>
<p>至於過去新上海美麗的住宅，都看不見了。殘存的幾處小洋房也大多是門窗破損不堪了。</p>
<p>當年建設新上海的夢是完全碎了！但願大家重行努力，再把它綴補起來。</p>

<h3>答復讀者　法律質疑</h3>
<p>（一）舊情復熾</p>
<p>楊有爲問茲有甲·乙·丙三人，甲二十三歲，乙十九歲，丙三十歲，（女）乙丙於二年半前實行同居。（無婚姻　據惟乙方家長默認丙爲女婿。）最近因乙方不滿丙方性情，時遭丙方虐待，故與甲互商應付辦法，（甲乙三年前已相饑分離二年半，半年前發生愛情）於本年三月間訂婚，立有訂婚紙兩張，（各執一張因乙方恐生麻煩，故存於甲處，）舉行議式時到賓客共十二人，介紹人證婚人各二位簽名或蓋章，目前甲乙之情形被丙方及乙方家庭知悉，（乙方家庭竭力反對，惟訂婚事不知，）故生疑點，如下，敬懇解答！</p>

<h3>上海交通三部曲　青樓堂差坐官轎　媲美當時上海道</h3>
<p>上海初　租界的時候，除了獨輪的羊角車之外，比較高貴一點的代步品，要算是轎子。官塲往來，一律坐轎，而且階級有別，與補服頂子相同。上海道坐的是八抬八扛的絲呢金頂大轎，知縣只能用四人抬的紅漆朱頂藍呢轎了。縉紳　秀所坐的轎子，頂華　　，旁嵌玻璃，謂之「撑陽轎」。一般平民只坐藍布小轎，醫生之類即是如此。</p>
<p>新嫁娘所坐的花轎，最爲艷麗，至今仍有許多人家結婚時沿用着，稱爲「四明彩轎」。到時花轎有紅綠兩色，依周堂術十吩咐，擇用其一。坐在這花團錦簇的轎子中的新嫁娘，喜氣洋洋，等於狀元乘馬遊街！</p>
<p>犯人押赴刑塲，送入監牢，也坐轎子，一種無頂小轎。妓女出堂差，倒可以坐綠呢官轎。碼頭上，車站上，都停着不少快轎，兜欖主顧。轎子實爲當時惟一交通工具。後來人力車輸入了，市塲上的轎子，漸漸减少。上海最後一個坐轎子的，恐怕要算傷寒名家張聲聲。馬路上早已滿布着汽車，他老人家却依然故我，坐他的轎子。到現在，張氏子孫仍把這頂轎子吊在門房裏，眞可與周蓮棠的一號汽車媲美。　轎子受人力車的影響而淘汰了，但起而代之者却是馬車。帽影鞭絲趁晚晴，暗塵隨馬鈿車輕，正可表示他是當時的「驕子」。官員，洋人，王孫公子，閨閣千金，靑樓妓女，出門皆以馬車代步，成爲一時風氣。乘馬車，兜圈子，遊張園，最爲時髦。即從內地來的闊老第一件事也是先備馬車。</p>
<h3>雙馬並駕八蹄飛　摩登堪稱享士美</h3>
<p>馬車都仿外國式樣，與舊有騾車大同小異。車有雙輪四輪之別，馬有單馬雙馬之分，式樣更有轎車篷車，種種不同，更有非轎非篷，車後豎着鐵柱，上張車蓋的。車上設備，也極考究。綠呢的窗帘，白銅的痰盂，又光的鏡子，插絹花的花瓶，冬天舖上狐皮褥墊，帶了白銅手爐脚爐，衝風冒雪，滿車生春。馬夫服裝，也是特製的，夏天穿葛紗，戴凉帽，冬日着皮衣，加披肩。後面跟着俊僕，雙馬並駕，八蹄飛馳，風光十足，招搖過市，路人側目。上海鎭守使鄭汝成便是坐了雙馬車赴白渡橋領事館拜客而被刺的。</p>
<p>當時官家眷屬，大都愛坐轎車；洋人，貴冑，妓女，則愛坐篷車，取其可以游目騁懷，此外又有一種橡皮鋼絲輪小馬車，呌做「享士美」的可以自己扣繮，駕上阿拉伯名馬，最稱摩登，專爲大爺們兜風之用，正經人很少坐他。當馬直風行之時，也有出租馬車的馬房，以「龍飛」馬第一塊招牌，即在今跑馬廳對面「國際戲院」的地方，這所房子，已久歷滄桑了。</p>
<h3>洋人氣燄高　坐車不平等</h3>
<p>當時駕御馬車，尙有一項規定，凡華人車輛，不得超越洋人，洋人車輛，儘可超越華人，這也由於租界當局歧視華人之故，猶之從前公園門口掛着「狗與華人不准入內」的牌子一般。會記猶太巨商哈同有一輛紅輪盤的馬車，但其時在英國，除非有爵位的貴族，才能㈦朱輪華轂」，平民是禁止使用的，何况哈同是個猶太人呢？哈同爲了這部車子，罰過很多的錢，據說南京路一條櫪木舖成的路，大半是用哈同罰款所造成的。</p>
<p>回想當年，在夕陽殘照中，坐了「享士美」的鋼絲馬車，蹄聲得得，馳騁於跑馬廳畔是何等的富有詩意。「時代巨輪」，又把馬車淘汰了。在民國廿六年市政當局的報吿中，祇剩了八匹馬，八輛車，不勝有今昔之感。</p>
<h3>車輛統計</h3>
<p>甲機動車</p>

<p>（二）營業小客車　六〇九</p>

<p>（七）汽胎輪貨車一〇，〇六五</p>
<p>（八）三輪貨車　四，六二九</p>
<p>（九）馬車　七二</p>
<p>上海的馬車，至今還殘留着幾十輛，不過已經沒有往日夕陽西照下，遊騁跑馬　的雅景了。而今僅僅是幾匹搜骨嶙峋的老弱殘馬，在北火車站前爲了接送旅客。博一些血汗錢罷了。（本報攝）</p>
<p>戰前盛行的二層公共汽車</p>
<p>這部初來的上海汽車，像不像一部四輪馬車？</p>
<h3>「行時怪嘨怒吼沿路亂放黑煙」</h3>
<p>汽車最初出現於上海，乃淸光緒末年的事。那時有兩位僑居上海的洋人，偶然回國，學會了駕駛汽車，覺得新鮮有趣，再到中國，便帶了兩部回來，洋　十里，從此也有汽車在街頭行駛，耳目一新。</p>
<p>那時的汽車，構造極爲幼稚，機件也很簡單，車身和馬車大致相彷彿，開車人坐在車廂外面，高高的好像坐在二層樓上。車行時塵土飛揚，開車者穿工裝，戴飛機眼鏡，鄭重其事。當時在踏脚板上，調節速率，突然停車之際，往往手忙脚亂。至於在路上拋錨，反爲馬車所追出，更是不足爲奇之事。因在那時坐汽車，只當作一種新奇的游戲，與現在乘坐游艇之類相同，並不以代步爲唯一目的。</p>
<p>那時新世界以西，完全是鄉村，繁盛之區，在泥城橋一帶，馬路也比較開闊。市民閒着無事，便站在路旁瞻仰車中人物，遇見「嗚，嗚，嗚」的汽車，放着黑烟駛過，便高聲呌喊，拍手大笑。當時的馬車階級看到了這不用馬拖的車子，不免有點妬意。「行時怪嘯怒吼，車馬驚躍」，「沿路亂放黑烟，右碍衛生」，「中途時常拋錨，妨碍交通」。以種種理由，聯名呈請工部局加以取締。可是工部局當時希望租界內也有幾輛汽車，，以　點綴而壯市容，所以對於馬車階級的呈請取締，未予照辦。</p>
<h3>司機奇貨可居</h3>
<p>後來汽車漸多，豪富之家，趨向時髦，紛紛向外洋定購，汽車夫遂成爲奇貨可居。許多比較年靑的馬夫，趁此機會，學習駕駛汽車。但汽車牌號不同，式樣申互異，駕駛方法亦不一，汽車夫知其一，不知其二，往往有人買了汽車，不會駕駛，因而擱在龍飛車行的棧房中，一年半載不足爲奇。至於會開汽車的，不問技術如何，人品如何，車主都出相當高的代價來僱用。可是那時許多購買汽車的闊人，仍另備馬車爲不時之需，足見他們對於汽車，還不十分信任。</p>
<h3>哈同夫人快車罰款</h3>
<p>第一次到上海的兩輛汽車，其中一輛爲猶太巨商哈同所得，哈同夫人羅迦陵常坐着玩，可是當時馬路狹隘，熙來接往，汽車像　午般行駛着，還要撞倒行人，打　東西。工部局對於這新「怪物」，不知應歸何類，遲疑許久，才決定照馬車徵捐，發給執照。但對於汽車行駛章程，却無規定，因哈同夫人的車子出事太多，於是將取締馬車辦法，推廣到汽車方面去，嚴禁疾駛違者罰款五百元。這在哈同夫人，却滿不在乎，身携鈔票，駕車飛馳於南京路中，遇巡捕上前干涉，立刻照付罰款，罰不勝罰，巡捕也慢慢地放任了。</p>
<h3>第一號車　第一輛</h3>
<p>哈同對於這第一輛汽車，非常珍視，爲保持這車的歷史起見，凡遇損壞，必定做零件配換，絕不另換新車。在羅迦陵未死之前，此本尙見其徐行過市。哈同旣有了這上海第一輛的汽車，很希望得到一張第一號的車照。而第一號的車照，已爲周湘雲所捐得，不肯輕易示人，所以第一號車向不出門，好在他所備的汽車，不至一輛，儘可把他安置在車間中。哈同曾以重價，商請轉讓，周氏不允。迄今這第一號汽車和第一輛汽車　，仍分　在滬兩家的　中。</p>
<h3>出租汽車海銀洋十元</h3>
<p>汽車初行之時，除豪富之家外，無法乘坐。民國五年，有一退職爲夫，的了同伴數人，在南京路前市政　舊址，即今新雅酒樓所在地，創設了家飛龍汽車行，專做出租生意，供人試坐，代價每小時銀洋十元，起碼半小時六元。雖取値較昂，但因事屬創舉，好奇者樂於一試。此爲上海出租汽車業之嚆矢　第一次歐戰發生時，汽車製造，已有進一步，戰事結束，歐美經營汽車事業者爭向中國開闢市塲，上海汽車，突然增加。出租汽車的營業日漸開展，公共汽車也在行駛了。上海的交通，竟成爲汽車的天下。雖然在淪陷時期。因汽油來源中斷，市上汽車，一度减少。勝利之後，許多擱置已久的汽車，又復出現，加以軍用的吉普車和大卡車，把馬路塞得滿滿的。再無人追憶到三十年前，車轔轔馬蕭蕭的時代了。</p>
<h3>漫談人力車　遠在同治十三年　法人携來東洋產</h3>
<p>人力車爲現在很普通的交通工具。用科學的眼光來看，不但太落伍，而且也不人道，可是在公共車輛如此擁擠的今日，人力車仍有存在的可能。</p>
<p>人力車是日本的產物，第一次到上海，遠在同治十三年。有一法國人呌米拉的，從日本輸入了這東西，經法租界公董局核准，於三月廿四日發出第一張照會。米拉旋得法公董局和公共租界工部局的許可，備車三百輛，在租界內營業。這是上海有人力車的第一幕。但米拉辦人力車營業兩年，並未因此發財，反而虧本，結果逃到海參衛去了。</p>
<p>人力車因來自日本，故起初名爲東洋車，其後車身一律改漆黃色，故又名黃包車。當初車輛，兩輪高大，與馬車後輪相似。輪爲木製，圍以鐵圈，行時轆轆作聲，震撼得很利害。車身較現在所見者爲大，可坐兩人，略如今之三輪車，其後因有男女苟且之事發生，捕房以有關風化，嚴行取締，改小車身，祇容一人。</p>
<h3>鋼絲橡皮輪一度被禁止</h3>
<p>人力車用鋼絲橡皮輪，是一大改進。當時泥城橋畔，有日通公司者，發明鋼絲代替木輪，鐵圈改爲橡皮胎，行車時不致顚簸，當時最稱摩登。但又以行走無聲，車夫不先警吿，常有衝撞行人之事發生，故工部局曾一度禁止，至民國三年鋼絲橡皮車始盛行。</p>
<p>在過去租界存在時，人力車有大照會小照會之分，大照會指有公共租界執照，同時又有法租界執照，假使再捐一張華界執照，便可通行無阻，最爲便利。小照會祗有法租界執照，而無公共租界執照，不能在公共租界內行駛，活動範圍旣小，價錢也較便宜。苦祇有華界執照而無租界執照，乃是第三流的車子。此是租界時代的一貫作風，不僅人力車一端而已。</p>
<h3>不分風霜雨露　整日東奔西跑</h3>
<p>人力車夫憑他們的氣力，來做這牛馬般的工作，生活最苦。整天整夜在風霜雨露之下，東奔西跑，出賣汗血，以維持其最低生活，還要受層層的剝削，悲慘痛苦，實非筆墨所能形容。民國廿三年七月，在工部局創導之下，成立了一個人力車夫互助會，辦理人力車夫的福利事業，很有一點成績。</p>
<p>當電車罷工或馬路水漲的時候，人力車夫成爲天之驕子，短短的一段路，會二千三千的討價。在閙市成爲澤國，不能涉水而渡的時候，祇得借重他們，雖然貴一點，也只好忍痛了。</p>
<p>野鷄包車乃人力車發跡的第一步。野鷄包車的車夫，大都是人力車夫出身，從拉軍而積錢，買得一輛半一新舊的車子，捐到一張自用人力車的執照，就可以在十字街頭大做其「野鷄」買賣。這類車子較新，乘客可以充作自有，所以車價也較貴。野　包車的車夫，有時有成爲租放車子的老板之可能。</p>
<h3>時代巨輪下人力遭淘汰</h3>
<p>人力車是被認爲不人道，不科學的。本市已有逐漸淘汰人力車的計劃，行政院在全國交通會議中，也有廢除人力車的議案。但遠在十年以前，工部局已實施其初步，如限制人力車登記，減少發給人力車執照，舉辦人力車夫登記之類皆是。其後抗戰軍興，租界上人口驟增，而公共交通反受限制，人力車不但不曾減少，反而大量增加。目前舊事重提，看來這通行七十餘年的人力車，終究有「判處死刑」的一天，但這五六萬人力車夫的生活，將如何解決？閒接依靠人力車爲生的也有三十萬人，更是個難題了。</p>
<h3>公共交通事業創立記</h3>
<p>一度行駛市區的流綫型公共汽車電車和公共汽車，是上海市民的唯一代步工具，雖然乘客如此擁擠，等候車輛，要費很多時間，但車資低廉，市民大都不肯放棄權利。考電車和公共汽車的歷史，並不很長，電車行駛遠不到四十年，公共汽車只有二十年。</p>
<p>上海自從開追以後，外僑絡續到滬，至一八九五年，洋涇浜以北租界的外僑，已有四千六百八十四人，法租界也有外僑四百三十二人，他們爲本身便利起見，覺得有創辦公共交通工具的必要</p>
<h3>電車</h3>
<p>一八八一年七月，上海怡和洋行向法租界公董局請求創辦電車，乃於八月一日召開租界納稅人大會聽取電車的意見，結果在九十三人中，有五十三人贊成，遂確定了籌備創辦租界電車的原則。</p>
<p>一八九五年美人享脫提議興辦洋涇浜公共租界內之電車，請工部局提交納稅人火會審査。上海自來水公司與自來火公司聞訊，以電車軌道用　　電流，如果佈置失當，曾銷蝕或損壞埋在路下的管子，故致函工部局，表示異議，不久享脫返美。另有一個呌韋斯脫的，向工部局聲請，謂納稅人會如接受享脫之提議，彼願出資十五萬兩，　築鐵軌二公里，經營電車。但享脫原議已遭否決，其議遂寂。</p>
<p>一八九七年，比商軌道　築公司提出在租界　　電車，共後復有法商里昂遠東工業　築公司，提出　　請求。其時法公董局原意欲與公共租界合　電車事業，所以將這案擱置下來。</p>
<h3>英人企圖專利　法商分道揚鑣</h3>
<p>一八九八年三月廿四日，公共租界工部局和法租界公董局合組了一個電車設計委員會，由公共租界派董事兩名，法租界派董事一名會同兩局工程師組成之。時公共租界工部局主張採用寬一四四公尺的標準軌，而法公董局認爲標準暫需費過昂，工資難以民衆化，不如採用一公尺的寬度，結果雙方各行其是。至一八九九年十月四日，公共租界工部局和法租界公董局又開聯席會議，審査所收各國工廠計劃書，投標的工廠計六家：（一）法商立興洋行，（二）德商聯合電氣公司，（三）比商軌道建築公司、（四）法商里昂工業建築公司，（五）美商上海電車公司，（六）英商英國電氣運輸公司。審査結果，認爲美商上海電車公司的計劃最好，條件也最合。逐將計劃書於十月七日在字林報上公布，十七日召集兩租界選舉人大會，徵救同意，結果又爲大會所否決。</p>
<p>據說否決的原因，由於其時選民，多數爲英人，大家希望將這項企業，留給英人專利，所以法國總領事向公董局說，公共租界選民大會，旣決定將電車企業留給英商包辦，我們也該研究法商包辦的計劃來對付。因此法國廠商，大肆活動。終於一九〇五年十一一月，比　國際遠東公司與法公電周成立初步協定，次年一月廿四日正式訂立合同，今法商電軍公司遂自此誕生。</p>
<h3>一九〇八年電車誕生</h3>
<p>公共租界工部局對謚電車行駛計劃。雖經否決，但仍積極進行。一九〇二年重行招標，結果核准了白魯電氣工程公司的計劃，於一九〇三年五月十四日簽訂合同，規定在三年內實行通車，嗣因闊軌缺乏，狹軌載重太少，以致擱淺。至一九〇五年，商得工部局之同意，將這專營權　給上海電車公司。</p>
<p>兩租界的電車，經當局決定後，分別進行敷設路軌，樹立電竿的工作。當時規劃的路綫，公共租界計三條：（一）自靜安寺至虹口公園，（二）自靜安寺至十六鋪，（三）自楊樹浦至十六舖。法租界規定兩條；（一）自小東門至徐家匯，（二）自寳昌路至徐家匯。一九〇八年二月，法租界電車，開始通車，一個月後，公共租界的電車，也行駛了。許多人渴望已久的電車終於實現。</p>
<h3>坐者無恙　生意興旺</h3>
<p>當車行駛之初，市民都覺得很奇怪，於是外灘一帶每天立滿了看熱閙的人。洋涇浜一帶的馬路兩旁，口講手　，街談巷議，悉以電車爲資料。乘坐者除西人外，華人極寥寥。因當時認電氣爲十分危險，袋中如有金銀，乘者即有觸電之處。大衆爲此荒唐之言所惑，不敢身試。故當時車身上，大書「穩快價廉，大衆可坐」字樣，以廣招徠，一月之後，坐者無恙，生意始逐漸興旺。</p>
<h3>民國二年　南市通車　無軌電車繼之而起</h3>
<p>南市電車，與公共租界法租界電車，鼎足而三，惟創立較租界爲遲。在租界電車實現之後，外僑早已注目及此，屢向當局請求，都未接受。民國元年，內地電燈公司經理陸件鴻，困公司中有儲電機若干架，極合行駛電車，呈請市政當局試辦，核准後，便集資二十萬元，向國外訂購材料，開始建築。民國二年材料始到上海，進行敷軌，閱三個月工竣，七月試車，八月一日正式開駛。從此南市也有常車了。</p>
<p>一九一四年，公共租界開始行駛無軌電車，共分兩路：（一）自北河南路老靶子路至民國路，（二）自乍浦路海寗路口至愛多亞路。法租界無軌電車至一九二六年始開駛，當時共分三路：（一）自吉祥街至江西路，（二）自鄭家木橋至福建路，（三）自敏體尼蔭路至徐家匯，交通更見便捷。一度曾傳擬以無軌電車代替有軌電事，但終未實現，不過近來新添設的路綫，已都是無軌的了。</p>
<h3>公共汽車應時而生</h3>
<p>公共汽車的行駛，是在一九二四年開始的，但遠在創辦電車的時候，已有人主張行駛公共汽車，以爲汽車不必舖軌設綫，工程此較簡易，費用亦可减省。結果工部局已決定開辦電車計劃，公共汽車的提談遂擱淺。</p>
<p>一九二零年，英人童漢生組織中國汽車公司，計劃在公共租界內行駛公共汽車，所走的路綫，自黃浦灘出愛多亞路經西藏路海寗路至吳淞路，與工部局訂立特別契約，准其營業，但因經費關係，不曾實現。一九二一年，童漢生舊事重提，計劃從靜安寺經愚園路到兆豐花園的路綫，與工部局交涉後，以可坐三十人的汽車兩部，開始行駛，但也因經費大得出乎意外，收支不能相抵，不久又停駛‘</p>
<h3>一九二四年巨型車出現</h3>
<p>這時另有亞諾爾特和弗蘭特利克也在擬一公共汽車計劃，在中國汽車公司停業後，弗蘭特利克即以代表資格，向公部局請求在公共租界內行駛公共汽車，至一九二三年一月，獲得專利權。八月間，乃集資本一百萬兩，正式創立中國公共汽車公司。開始建造廠房，定造車輛，積極進行。行駛的路綫與工部局商議的結果，決定爲十條。第一路自黃浦灘經愛多亞路，福煦路，哈同路而至靜安寺，於一九二四年十月，以車六輛開始行駛。上海第一次巨型公共汽市出現，姿態遠比落伍的電車爲摩登，大家踞坐皮墊之上，竊幸平民階級也有大衆可坐的汽車了。據說黃色公共汽車的構造，乃依技術專家塞立克的建議，採用史蒂芬生標準底盤，减少車胎與路面的磨擦，行駛平穩，管理容易，乘客也安全舒適。確是經過一翻研究的。一九二九年，工部局修正公共汽車公司的臨時契的，締結正式特殊事業協定，公司一面付給工部局馬路使用費，一面完全獨佔公共租界的公共汽車事業。</p>
<p>公共汽車公司自取得公共租界的專利權後，努力展開其業務，擴張其路綫，先後增闢十五綫，全長七十餘哩。其全感時期共有各式汽車一七四輛，建造車棚，設立裝配修理的車廠，雇用司機四百二十人，售票員五百八十七人，査票員九十二人，機匠一百三十三人，雜役一百五十餘人，此外尙有臨時雇工，乃一組織龐大的機關，每天乘客在一九一三八年曾至二十五萬人的最高額。</p>
<p>大家爲了上電車，互相「傾軋」着，結果造成了一團糟的秩序，賣票的口裏不免發出許多不中聽的怨言，因此常常發生許冬糾紛事件。其實如果大家都守秩序，排隊上車，這是一件多麽好的事呢？</p>
<p>（本報攝）</p>
<h3>一九二九年添開特快車</h3>
<p>公共汽車在初行駛時，僅有一種巨型車輛，規定班决。一九二九年添開特別快車，在上辦公處時行駛。除起點終點外，沿途概不停留。一九三四年因乘客擁擠，又創行雙層公共汽車，爲上海交通史上創一新紀錄，一九三七年，更添造流綫型車加入行駛，尤爲新穎。迨一二八後，汽油來源斷絕，公共汽車隨而停駛，經過四年的敵僞摧殘，這許多車輛都已不知去向，大槪給日人搬走了，所剩下的，只是些殘破得無法法應用的車子。現在市公用局限其在十一月以前復業，否則將取銷其專利權，不知公共汽車公司的主持人，作何計劃？</p>
<p>法租界的公共汽車，爲電車公司的附帶營業，一九二五年電車公司和法公董局訂立開辦無軌電車和公共汽車的合同，規定在無軌電車行駛後六個月內，即應開駛公共汽車兩綫。一九二七年二月，法租界亦有公共汽車了。</p>
<h3>華商汽車迭遭戰亂</h3>
<p>華界的公共汽車，乃華商公共汽車公司所經營的，華商公共汽車公司於十七年四月與市政府簽訂合同，獲得專利權，十一月，先在閘北通車。「一二八」時，損失奇重。市政府遷入市中心區之後，又復擴充路綫，以致南市浦東兩處不遑兼顧，自願放棄。南市原有滬南公共汽車公司放車行駛，因經營不善，於二十年宣吿停業，乃由市公用局自辦，迨抗戰發生，上海淪陷，也停駛了。</p>

<h3>加加組織之因果　已往的缺點內在的困難　實行管制須具先決條件</h3>
<p>配紗機構</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕紗廠聯合配貨，自上星期五，吳市長表示加強管制，前途發展如何，各方均在期待中，查自八月三十日，民營紗廠開始聯配，迄今一月又半，結果未盡圓滿，頗遭各方指摘，本月四日，立法院孫九錄委員等之查問，尤僅經濟當局無以自圓其說，遂有吳市長兼任管理委員會主任委員加強管制之新措施，據消息靈通者方面稱：此舉醞釀已久，並非出於突然的措置，聞當初政府之意，原擬將各紗廠之生產額，全鑒於紡建支配之下，其聯合機構，當然頗有力量。</p>
<p>初步通融</p>
<p>嗣以不欲操之過急，且紗廠業表示願以自治之精神，協助政府之平價政策，故實施時相當通融。依其辦法，請購者，須經向各該紗廠紡業公會，在紡管會督率之下，議定價格，公表配售數量。照此辦法，紡管會除參與議價外，對於實際分配情形，並未深究，故每逢星期一，三，五開紗時，紡建與紗廠業仍各行其是，惟複製工業界之有力分子，指爲聯配未曾實行，要非無因。</p>
<p>聯配失敗</p>
<p>惟開始時之數期，掛牌尚能勉強維持，迨後黑市日漲，紗廠之配售實況，即日益模糊，棉製品複製工業當初之不滿紡建者，頗覺紡建貨雖少，而公開程度，尚遠勝於民營紗廠，且用紗實銷戶，向之與紗廠在往來者，其請購較聯配前愈難，紗號業屢次表示向隅，無法沾光，而黑市紗之流通則日盛，業內業外，乃　懷疑念，而紗廠定乃爲眾矢之的矣。據紗廠業方面透露消息，似亦有其困難之點。</p>
<p>紗廠困難</p>
<p>如本市紗廠之加入聯配者，爲二十六家，而小型廠及市區以外之大廠不與爲，平配既帶有犧牲性，何厚彼薄此，此其一，八月十九日外匯變率之始，當局曾明言各廠用花，已由政府設法配給，照舊匯率結清，則原料之來源既未漲價，紗價也不應漲，而有少數大廠，匯票至今未結，當請求照舊匯率結算，但始終未邀准，此其二，黑市超過二百萬（二十支）時配價限於一百五十五萬，紡建出紗三分之一，商廠了紗三分之二，紗廠認爲犧牲太重，此其三，紗廠連配多期，實際當有若干之犧牲，而黑市騰漲，民無實惠，從予取巧者轉賣發財之機會，此其四，因此種種，疑憤交集，而政府迄無改進之表示，遂有一部份同業當發爲憤激之言，以爲紗廠既無法賺錢，則停工而改回本錢可也，政府能犧牲，則讓給政府墊本開工亦可也，事態愈益深刻化，乃有景近變更管理組織之舉。</p>
<p>後果可慮</p>
<p>據內行看法，此後民營紗廠所出之紗，將完全置於紡建管理之下，而以紡建開售之法處理之，限價或將略加，黑市當不致公然無忌，用紗實銷廠家，政府亦必將加強管制，其最後階段可能管至布號，惟本市之管制日強，紗布之生產或將日減，而管制綫以外之市面，將益熱鬧，其市價亦將益漲，則就社會全般之見地言，爲利爲害，頗值得研究云，聞棉製品複製工業界之權威者曾面告紡管會某君，請鄭重考慮，勿操之過急，致欲速不達，造成物資之恐慌，某君亦甚爲動容，惟表示紗廠不肯與政府真誠合作，政府亦自有不得已之處，故管制雖必須加強，而其後果如何，頗堪注目。</p>
<p>最後決策</p>
<p>紡織事業管理委員會之主任委員原爲朿雲章氏，此君爲紡織業之耆宿，宋院長本極倚重，且其本人出身於事業界，於實際疾苦，知之較詳，此次請辭，據聞出於氏所力請，以自卸仔肩，今主任由吳市長兼任，而朿氏仍任委員，紡建方面，除朿總經理外，尚有副經理二人，一爲吳味經氏，一爲李升伯氏，吳本爲委員，此次李亦任委員，觀察家認爲機構重心，仍在紡建，朿氏恐仍爲操有決策權之唯一有力人物，吳市長則將運用其政治上之權力，使此項決策，能加強實施耳。</p>
<p>學者意見</p>
<p>一般經濟學家對於紗布漲價，固表示不滿，而對於統制之加強，亦認爲執行不易，某有地信者稱，經濟事態，仍須以經濟政策處置之，統制必須有全面之打算，與完備之統計材料，始克有濟，今實施限於本市，恐將促成物資之逃避，統計偏於一隅，未可爲統盤之調節，最後不若米糧有硬性之補充，黑市終難俯首，敵偽時期紗布業已受盡打擊，元氣薄弱，紗廠遭逢時會，頗有盈餘，應善爲疏導，勿使資金逃避，生產萎頓，在紗廠業亦就適可而止，公開其配售之內容，以與社會相共見云。</p>
<h3>美鈔規定買賣價格後錢兌業大受影響　公會要求恢復自由交易</h3>
<p>本市美鈔市價，自中央銀行規定各錢兌業之合法買賣價目後，市場冷靜，各錢莊整日皆少有買賣，茲悉上海市錢兌業公會已據情呈請當局准予恢復七日以前之自由交易，否則非特該同業等遭受損失不貲，且恐與政府管制原意成完全相反之結果，聞當局接受與否，目前尚未答覆云。</p>
<h3>棉價將漲　埃及棉農預測</h3>
<p>〔路透社亞歷山大利亞十二日電〕埃及之棉花種植者不願將新棉出售，因彼等相信和平會議結束以後，棉花價將告激漲，屆時歐洲方面之業務即將展開，埃及棉之需要勢必激增也。</p>
<h3>國貨展覽商場明日舉行開幕禮</h3>
<p>中國生產促進會上海分會，爲提倡國貨重建國人愛用國貨心理同同，以挽救我國工商業危機起見，特在南京路四四四號（仙樂舞宮隔壁）建搭場址，主辦上海市國貨展覽暨商場，業經籌備就緒，定於十月十五日上午十時舉行開幕儀式，該會並於今（十四）日下午三時在該場大禮堂茶會招待新聞界，報告籌備經過云。</p>
<h3>上週人造絲漲起五正萬　絲綢亦有增無減</h3>
<p>人造絲上週又呈高翔，一二〇號天橋有光，　一爲三百七十萬元，週二大五萬元，週三突形興奮，開高三十五萬元，週四續抬升二十五萬元，直至週末紡建公司配貨量增加，乃告下挫，跌落十五萬元，一週內結果漲起五十萬元，雜牌有光及各號半光等俱亦跟進，總之，配售量不能滿足實銷數即人造絲價無抑平之望，因執貨者識透此中玄機，逐步提高，使廠商不得不低頭屈服也。</p>
<p>廠經形勢堅穩，CDE各級，始終盤旋上落，只有五萬元差額，於經新岸總在二百七十萬至七十五萬之間，開口貨在五十萬至五十五萬元之左，人心尚望看好，不過交易殊少，以致欲漲無力，綢貨大都有增無減，美亞被面週一做二百七十萬元，最小週二三做六十五萬元，最大週末喊二百七十五萬元，華錦縷上週內總計漲起一百元，盛杭各貨，類皆平穩，無甚更變。</p>
<h3>銻進口仍須管制　美政府頃宣佈</h3>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓十二日電〕生產管理局頃宣佈：銻及銻鍍物業已恢復進口統制，據稱此項措置之目的在限制供提煉用之銻鍍或下等銻之輸入。</p>
<h3>參議員請辦低利借款救濟小型工商業　由市銀行劃出若干資金　財委會今日商具體辦法</h3>
<p>本市目前之利率，自每月一角二分至二角不等，均爲三日五日七日十日一結，平均三個月至五個月，本利即可增達一倍，商人之物價亦以同樣比例累進，方可經維持本息，因此百分之八十以上之民眾，終日辛勤血汗所獲得之些微收支，均爲少數之銀行錢莊及擁有財產者坐享其成，而社會愈形安，近來各界向政府所請各項低利貸款，亦不免有用於放息者，市民不僅未得絲毫實惠，反受其害，糧貸即其一例，同時所謂工商借款，能借得者亦均屬有勢力有辦法之上層人物，政府多借貸一次，彼輩即多發一次財，若下層人民生計不能改善，國家難臻富強康樂之境，社會無法確保治安，參議員　襄等有鑒於此，特提出請上海市銀行舉辦低利借款以抑平物價，而安全大多數民眾生活之提案一項，其辦法爲由市府令上海市銀行劃出若干資金，以每月最低利率分借於確實經營日用品之小型工業及小資本商店與日常菜蔬行家，凡受貸之工廠商店與行家，政府並得限制其售價，市參會財政委員會對此案頗爲重視，已決於今日下午三時假交通銀行三樓舉行小組會議，討論具體辦法。</p>
<h3>南昌物價飛漲　省府組物價評議會</h3>

<h3>意大利通貨膨脹　物價漲四千六百倍</h3>
<p>〔路透社羅馬十二日電〕意大利現正遭遇極危險之通貨膨脹時期，倘政府不即採取適當措置，則意國脆弱之經濟機警，或將趨於崩潰。目前里拉之失去信用，其主要緣由乃因巴黎和會決議義國應賠償蘇聯一億美元之故。同時其他各國之賠償要求，至少亦須履行其一部份。</p>
<p>〔路透社巴黎十二日電〕意大利之鈔票發行額，幾十六倍於戰前數額，官市物價指數，較前高二千三百倍，黑市物價指數，較戰前高四千六百倍。</p>
<h3>美貨化學品侵入　國產化工瀕絕境</h3>
<p>本市現有化學工廠十餘家，於勝利後五個月中，曾一度興盛，該廠等大多以漂白粉，氯酸鉀，燒鹼碳酸鎂，碳酸鈣等供給市上各工廠，然自美貨漂白粉，氯酸鉀等侵入市場後，因其價格較本貨成本低廉，幾乎獨佔本市化學原料之買賣，至此各化學工廠已瀕絕境，紛紛自動停止，天原化學廠。每月可出漂白粉四·五百箱，氯酸鉀三十箱左右，現在此兩項主要生產部門，工作已全部停頓，僅數製碳酸鎂及碳酸鈣（製橡膠原料）維持營業云。</p>

<h3>新貨物稅的檢討</h3>
<p>— 徐日清</p>
<p>政府於本月一日，開征新貨物稅，計有麥粉，水泥，茶葉，皮毛，錫箔及迷信用紙，飲料品，化妝品七種，並將棉紗的稅率從百分之三·五提高至百分之五，捲烟，烟葉熏火，柴食糖，按舊率無變動，洋酒與啤酒，由百分之六十增至百分之百，近日廠商一片呌苦聲，毛織業婉拒貨物稅暫緩派員駐局，永嘉茶商且停止茶葉運滬。但據上海貨物稅局表示，貨物稅是轉嫁消費者之間接稅，並不影響廠商等語，究竟貨物稅，是怎麼一回事，這是很值得探討。</p>
<p>貨物稅確是間接稅，所以課稅對象，不是直接課於所得者而課於消費者。因此，不能符合能力負担之原則，也未能符合財政充分原則，在一般理論上其缺點有四：</p>
<p>（一）間接收入及納稅時間與費用，均不確實。</p>
<p>（二）間接稅創辦時調查費雖微，但其日後檢查費徵收費等甚鉅。</p>
<p>（三）間接稅確能轉嫁，但其歸宿，大都在無產階級或中產階級，違反公平之原則。</p>
<p>（四）間接稅的徵收，妨礙產業發展及交通發展，不合國民經濟原則。</p>
<p>所以現代租稅發展過程，均由1比例稅漸至累進稅，2分類稅漸至綜合稅3對物稅漸至對人稅，處處爲求達到平等，確實，便利，經濟四大原則。貨物稅其實不合時代潮流，吾國政府欲求財政收支平衡，增加稅收，現在還在擴大貨物稅範圍，這種措施，只好說是一種不得已的手段。</p>
<p>但是這種稅收，真能彌補這赤字財政嗎？拿茶葉來說，當此入超數字非常龐大，出口萎靡不振的時候，自然只好限於內銷，但這個稅收的數字，不能不幾何？拿毛織業來說，在「價廉物美」美貨來與洋貨競爭，倘再加上貨物稅成本和銷路更成問題，結果恐怕止有減工關門。麥粉，火柴，食糖，本是人民必需品，論理不應當加稅。只有化妝品算是一種奢侈品，不妨課以重稅，無奈在美國化妝品傾銷之下，早已站不信脚，何況生產量還有限得很，收入又有幾何？至於皮毛，錫箔及迷信紙，更非主要商品，於財政上並無多大帮助。據說：上海市八月份貨物稅的收入，大概在二百六十億左右，恐怕新貨物稅開征以後，未必能照理想增加，而其弊則有下列四點可以預測。</p>
<p>（一）壓抑民族工業　已經無法與外貨競爭的國貨，再加征貨物稅，其銷售成本不是更增加了嗎？其競爭力不是更薄弱了嗎？</p>
<p>（二）加重平民負担　貨物稅大部是消費品，是人民日用必需品。征稅以後，廠商勢必至將價格提高，結果只有平民增加了負担。與政府的平價政策，可說背道而馳。</p>
<p>（三）使外貨益發暢銷　美貨充斥已引起社會人士的憂慮，今國貨成本增高，外貨不是更易於推銷嗎？雖然江海關已代徵國外輪入貨物稅，外貨的成本，是照印華司價值課稅，國貨則照市價課稅的，叫國貨怎樣競爭呢？</p>
<p>（四）私貨逃稅必將增加　目前私貨逃稅，已成公開的秘密，政府似乎並無切實辦法。在重稅率之下，無疑地將增加一般奸商的徼倖心理。</p>
<p>現在，一般廠商已經支持不住了，都在那裏大聲疾呼。這個時候政府應該仔細地考慮一下，這種捨本逐末的政策，到底是否值得推行。</p>

<h3>邊疆文化敎育館　將籌設邊文印刷所　中央邊報在京復刊</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十三日電〕敎部爲宣揚民族文化，鼓勵邊民內向起見，曾於去年十月，發行蒙藏文中央邊報各一種，嗣因還都關係，停刋數月，茲已在京復刋，改爲雜誌型，十六開、本，仍定每月發行一次。又敎部所屬國立邊疆文化敎育館，已決定籌設邊文印刷所一所，儘先成立蒙文藏文回文三部份，並完成銅模鑄字等重要設備。</p>
<h3>大學生程度水準　敎部決予以提高　首先着重一年級</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十三日電〕敎部以年來大學生程度水準降低，應予改進提高，例如上年大學錄取新生及格標準爲四十分者，（各校情形不一致，並非各校皆以四十分爲及格），敎部規定今年必須增高標準十分爲五十分。根本辦法，在修訂大學課程標準，及人學制度。</p>
<p>制度方面</p>
<p>在已往敎部曾設立少數先修班，以收容高中畢業未考入大學之學生，經過先修考試及格，保送升入大學，以百分之五十名額爲限，本年敎部已通令各大學，及獨立學院，皆設有先修班。現在性質，與往昔不同，在班修習一年，經考試及格，一律直升大學。同時，將各大學之課程標準修訂，於各種主要課程，整理內容，汰除繁複，以期適合，而減少已往在高中讀過之敎材於大學一年級前期再行複習之弊。蓋現制先修班一年，已修習相當課程，不必重複，濫費學習時聞。</p>
<p>課程方面</p>
<p>大學各學院全部課程，敎部早經着手修訂，現仍在繼續進行中。惟茲事體大，須經過許多專家一再開會討論，簽註意見，精益求精，始可作爲定案。公布標準之期，恐須延至明年。聞大學生敎育水準之提高，首先着重一年級。循先修班已經修習之過程，將課程之教材內容汰除繁複，予以演進，以免耗費時間。故敎部將於通令各大學提高英文程度之外，對其他主要科目之程度水準，亦一併應予提高云。</p>

<p>征輪昨晚戰來大爲進步，三前鋒之傳遞投擲，亦時有美妙表演，守衛方面，大爲成功，使用人釘人防守法，竟使汕隊一籌莫展。惜乎征輪在球規方面，似尚未嫻熟，如後塲十秒鐘之規定等等，該隊如能假以時日訓練，年靑力壯，大有希望也。汕隊則大爲反常，全隊凌亂不堪，投籃不中，竟似爲一乙組籃球，致遭敗績。</p>

<h3>參觀空軍軍官學校　筧橋一日</h3>
<p>每個人的心坎裏對那雄壯而又美麗的『中國空軍的搖籃』都懷着一種依依不捨的情感。筧橋的每一角落都是可愛的。</p>
<p>本報民者　謝寶珠</p>
<p>朋友們一個個都到杭州去玩了，聽來不免有點羨慕。五年了，未曾見到過西子湖。秋高氣爽，西子湖上，輕舟葉葉，晚霞映入秋波，比往日更輕盈更美麗吧。蘇　兩旁的綠葉，也該豐滿些了吧。可是，時間不允許，也祇能打消去意，好在西子湖景給我的印象依舊是那麼鮮明，那末深刻。忽然，雙十節前一天，有人問我要不要到杭州去，那兒筧橋空軍軍官學校請上海幾位音樂家去演奏，特派飛機接送。一聽到「筧橋」兩個字，頓時使我覺得自己是在一個極大的機場內，再從空軍將士和敵人作戰直想到電影上的緊張鏡頭，不禁感到：西子湖雖然隨時可以一遊，空軍學校却非在此時前去參觀一下不可。這樣，我們就在國慶日的早晨到了這個「中國空軍的搖籃」。飛機還未降落，就見到了它的荘嚴，它的偉大二十七架飛機在你面前作大編隊表演，接着是形成了一个「　」字。再到地面，又看见司令台上满紮花彩，國旗在四周飄揚，一排又一排的空軍健兒正在軍樂聲中操練，原來是閱兵節目剛完畢。</p>

<p>承駕駛我們飛機的空軍學校飛行敎官李成源中尉帶我們到敎育長辦公室，由小提琴家費曼爾小姐給我們介紹胡敎育長偉克，胡夫人和胡老太太·胡敎育長給我的第一個印象，就是一位非常精明能幹的長官，體格魁梧，十足的英武氣槪，同時却又彬彬有禮，一眼看去，便知道他曾受過高深敎育。</p>
<p>胡教育長是江西萍鄉人，今年三十八歲。他本人就是軍官學校第一期畢業的，距今已有十五年。胡氏早年曾任戴院長季陶的武官，到過德國。一九四三年到印度，任該校初級班教練主任。一九四四年赴英國硏究航空敎育，在去年年底回國。本年八月，到筧僑主持校政。胡敎育長本身的一舉一動，就是代表了他敎育的宗旨：「嚴肅時絕對嚴　，活潑時絕對活潑。」他自己覺得學生們一定認爲他管理太嚴，可是，在一個軍事的集團中，在一個龐大的隊伍中，當我們看到一切都是井井有條，整齊不亂，有記律，有系統時，我們對於州領導者的功續當然不會抹欣。</p>
<p>十點鐘，開始舉行國慶紀念大會，我們以來賓的資格，參加開會，看到二百來個官生，機械士，整齊地排列在佈置簡單莊重，同時又寬敞的大禮堂內，主席胡敎育長致詞。這種種精神上的表現，使我們每個人都感到興奮，我們爲着國家的力量，爲着空軍的前途而感到歡迎。</p>
<h3>全校佔地數千畝　內部設備簡潔整齊完整</h3>
<p>李成源敎官，是敎育長的副官，承他殷勤招得我們到各處參觀。空軍學校塲地之大，遠在我想像之外。據李敎官說，佔地的數千畝，單以校內一個跑馬塲來講，就等於上海的跑馬廳那末大。</p>
<p>軍官學校，現在爲第二十五及二十六期，另有少數廿四期的，共有學生及機械士，的四百四十名，平均年齡爲十入至二十二歲。敎官的八十名。此外還有勤務兵等，他們分住在一排排的宿舍內，內部佈置十分簡潔整齊。每人床旁的櫃子，都是整日的開着，以備値日官隨時檢查。學生休息室，娛樂室，各種陳設，一一齊備。室內運動有檯球桌，還有特　的彈子房。游泳池設備很講究，池水碧綠淸洌。四週還裝有水銀燈，晚上亦可游泳。大禮堂雖然不太大，可是光綫和佈置都够得上標準。合後並附建復合，專供演劇化裝之用。　在淪陷期間，敵人在該校建築堡壘，駐有騎兵，把一切建築都破壞損毀。以前的大禮堂也是受到災殃之一部分。一年前，學校恢復時，按照舊樣重建而成。同時，許多軍官的住宅，也一座座建立起來。當軍官學校復員而重回筧橋時，曾命令日俘二千名修理機塲，校舍，種植樹木，作爲對日俘的一種實際上的敎訓。　除了跑馬塲有天小十六匹馬，每晨七至八時供學生輪流騎騁外，校內還有狩獵的荒地。最多是野兎，野鷄等動物，有時還能獵到小狐狸，小狼之類。記者們到校的時候，有該校美軍官顧問二人，正去找敎育長派人陪同打獵，看他們的興緻都非常濃厚。</p>
<p>校中的飛機，因爲戰後恢復不易，僅有數十架，大多是訓練用的PT-17。此外，還有自用火車站，有往來上海筧橋間鐵路綫，專作運貨等用途。</p>
<h3>校務一斑</h3>
<p>關於空軍學校敎育處業務，大致分四科：（一）飛行科，初級教練爲六個月，分四個階段，初步飛行，需達七十小時，至畢業爲止，應飛二百五十小時。（二）敎授科，專負學術科敎育之　。（三）站務科，負責筧橋，西興，喬司，嘉興四機場修建，警衛及有關飛行敎練上之業務。（四）編譯科，譯述敎材，出版刋物增編航空字典。</p>
<p>政治部的業務，負責政治敎育，訓育，精神訓練，考核與防奸，小組討論，學術硏究，康樂活動等種種。</p>
<p>經理部業務，分：（一）給養，除了衣食，洗衣，理髮，種種都由校方負担外，每月每生另給　津約四萬元。（二）服裝分特種及普通裝具兩種。（三）撫卹。</p>
<p>衛生科有門診部份，機塲救護，體格檢査，環境衛生，及病院等。其他如修理工廠及空軍電臺等設備，都很週詳。校內有女護士及女職員，共三十餘人。</p>
<h3>音樂演奏　聽衆鴉雀無聲</h3>
<p>很不巧，國慶日放假，學生們都分散了，致未能見到他們課內外的活動。可是晚上的音樂演奏在今年空校的國慶紀念史上，留下了最精彩的一頁。在色彩調和，燈光柔　的台上，我們接連　廳到費曼爾小姐的小提琴獨奏，女高音獨唱，名提琴家普度希加老教授的中提琴表演，齊耐羣君的低音獨唱，最辛苦的要算是曾惠錫小姐的鋼琴表演，除了她獨奏二個節目外，自開始到底，全部由她伴奏。每一位的表演，都是非常精彩，美妙悅耳，難怪全塲數百聽衆鴉雀無聲，一個個都被陶醉了。</p>
<p>正是月圓光輝的晚上，空軍學校內一切都是靜悄悄的，惟有陣陣淸風拂而，秋天的夜，在筧橋的月下，更顯得詩意動人，頓時使你忘記了世界上的煩惱，比起溷濁喧鬧的上海來，眞好像天堂與汚池之分。</p>
<p>在馬蹄答答聲中，我們又看到了筧橋美麗的早長，空中的機聲也自遠而近。記者們利用了上午的時間，到離校二十里的西子湖上划船。下午，匆匆　機場返滬。可是每個人的心坎裏，對那雄壯而又美麗的「空軍搖籃」都懷着依依不捨的情感。筧橋的每一角落都是可愛的。願它「如日之升」，不斷地發揚光大！</p>
<h3>西安發衆自衛隊</h3>
<p>— 九月十四日西安訊　本報特約記者李馳</p>
<p>從各地的報導上，我們看到國內好些地方已先後組織起民衆自衛隊或其他相類似的組編，西安市並不例外，而且有七千個市民，已經編調在第一期裏，而且已經受訓結業。除了屬於市的自衛隊以外，還有屬於長安縣的民衆自衛總隊，前者的總隊長由西安警備司令孔令恂氏兼任，這兩個職任都是在八月間就任的。後者的總隊長是王定邦氏，全縣三十一鄉，每鄕分別設立一大隊。</p>
<p>西安市民衆衛總隊的成立，適在日本投降週年紀念日前夕的入月十三日，日本被打垮了一年還要民衆自衛，自然另有原因。大家總總記得：八月初旬李先念部由河南進入陝西之東南角。接着還有一般人不易判別的種種流言，而後來我們看到的，在省境內，確有幾個縣長被明令處分了：柞水縣縣長周夢飛爲了「於流匪擾境，未將情况判明前搜自行動，臨事張皇，舉措失當，有虧職守」，受撤職留任的處分；同縣的警察局局長亦因「搜自撤退，放棄職守」被撤職査辦；鎭安縣縣長趙文斌，因「擅離崗位，放棄職守，致造成重大過失」，被扣押法辦。這些文吿，不僅補充當時半官方新聞報導的不足而已</p>
<p>最明確的解釋，倒不如節錄陜省主席祝紹周氏在市民衆自衛總隊始業禮中一段演講詞：「……我們爲什麼要自衛？……第一，共產黨部隊不聽中央命令，到處竄擾，李先念部更由河南進入本省，並意圖竄擾關中，我們要保衛自己的生命財產，不能不起而自衛，第二，暴徒匪類破壞地方治安，安分守己的老百姓，不能不自衛。…」這一段話，比較「西安市民衆自衛隊規章」冒頭所開列的兩項使命，說得具體得多了。「規章」上僅說：「民衆自衛隊的使命有二：一，爲鞏固城防；二，爲永久離持社會秩序及市區治安。」</p>
<p>根據本年八月底最新的統計：西安全市居民已經再度增加至五十四萬，屬男性的佔五分之三，計三十三萬。這三十三萬之中，究竟有多少壯丁，合乎該隊「規章」所規定的年齡，（即二十歲起至四十歲止）很「粗校大葉」地估計一下，除了大半數二十歲以下和四十歲以上的老幼男性，適齡壯丁全部當在十萬左右，而今次要集訓的，按原定計劃就有兩萬人，分三期先後實施。這計劃遲兩三個月全部完成後，按數字推算一下，每五個壯丁之中，就有一個編在自衛總隊裏，這比率不能不說相當高。此外，還有駐防軍隊，軍官總隊，警備隊，警察，……等等，這些本來就足够維持地方治安而綽有餘裕了。　「規章一的條文很精密規定了受訓者和免訓者及緩訓者的界說。從記者的眼中看來，它比諸廣西的「民團」或「國民兵團」的，綿密得多。像這種組織，假如能够提早在八九年前全國普遍推行，定必增加民間的抗敵實力至若干倍。這原則已經有是够的事實證明：民衆自衛力的最高度發揮，必在於動用這力量的目的與全民衆的利益及其要求完全符合。</p>
<p>市內二萬名受訓的適齡壯丁，將按警察局十二個　管區　爲十二個大隊，四十七分隊，每個大隊和中隊，除隊長外，尙有政治指導員。爲了調訓便利，這兩萬名分三期先後舉行，每期的七千人。截至目前爲止，已有三分之一即第一受訓完畢。一個隊員在調訓期中要受足六十小時的訓練，才算結業。訓練時間，在市內是上午六時至八時八市郊是上午五時至七時。換句話說，每天兩小時的要受足三十天，才算完畢。「規章」上又規定了「受訓練的隊丁，不得藉受訓之名義與機會，向保甲，住戶，機關，學校，廠方，店戶需索要求受訓津貼財物」，不過「工廠工人受訓時間，如每日工作十至十二小時者，由廠方負担仍給十二小時工資；如工作在十小時以下者，由工人本身負担，仍僅取得十小時之工資」。又，「工資之給與如以工程數量爲計者，（如紡紗若干，織布若干）由總隊部函廠方計議決定」。</p>
<p>屬於適　壯丁，雖和尙、道士亦不能免；自由職業更無例外。不過醫師則參加防護團編組救護隊；律師，會計師，與報人記者，則另定辦法施行。因爲報人大半係「夜作日息」，晨早六時就要趕到操塲受訓，自有困難，他們將來或者另編一隊，可能就編在下月初即將開始的第一一期裏。總隊長孔令恂氏曾以愼重的語調吿本市新聞界：「爲執行國家法令，遵重國民身份之平等，君等必須受此一　！」抗戰中徵兵而新聞記者曾享受「免役」，今回沒有這份「特典」了。</p>
<p>爲了加强市內治安，除了加緊調　自衛隊隊丁以外，最近正嚴密抽査戶口；（甚至警備司令也親自出馬去覆査高級官員住宅，作爲示範）。昨日起，開始登記自衛槍枝。　此外，本省當局已奉令籌設新兵役管區，全省共有兩個師管區司令部，分設在西安和南鄭，五個團管區司令部，分設在西安，南鄭，大茘，寳鷄，安康等地。</p>
<p>至於國民義務勞動服役，本市亦將日內實行。勞動時日計每人每年十天，服役的是十八歲至三十五的男子，從事於築路，水利，自衛，地方造產和其他，地方公益事項。不過按自衛總隊的「規章」規定；原則上在組訓期內，適齡壯丁祇參加一種編受一種訓練，服役一種勤務自衛隊隊丁當然可以免除義務勞動服役。</p>

<h3>新兵役法的特色</h3>
<p>— 儲子凋</p>
<p>新兵役法，於雙十節公布了。我國之有兵役法，自民國二十二年六月國府公佈，廿五年三月施行以後，已有十年的歷史一。其間曾經二度修正，一次在抗戰正殷的三十二年三月，這是第二次。此次修正的主要原則，在樹立國防建軍的基礎。國府在恢復徵兵令上說得很淸楚，「立國於今日，非鞏固國防，不足以圖存，尤非實行徵兵制度，不足以謀國力之充實」，所以「將原頒兵役法規重加修訂，並將各師團管區重新建立，針對國防需要，確定平時徵兵制度」。於此，可知這次公佈的新兵役法，是確定平時徵兵制度的基本大法，含有永久的性質與抗戰時期的徵兵，用意不盡相同。凡我中華民國的人民，人人皆有服兵役的義務，際此停徵期滿，國府明令恢復繼續徵兵的時候，人人與這新兵役法發生關係，都應認議其意義，了解其內容。茲特申論新兵役法的特色於次：</p>
<p>第一，新兵役法是超黨派的，純粹國家化的。這一次的修改兵役法，最使人滿意的，是本着軍隊國家化的原則，眞正實現使軍隊脫離政黨的活動，而純粹國家化。國家統一，是立國必備的要件，而其唯一的前提，必先不使任何一黨擁有獨立的軍隊，以武力作政治鬥爭的工具，從而做到國軍以外無軍隊，國防以外無武力。能够做到如此境地，社會安定和人民自由才有保障，政治民主化也才不致落空。如果一國之內有兩個對立的軍隊，形成武力割據的局勢，那就不能稱爲眞正統一的國家。所以這次新兵役法第三十條第三款規定：「應徵應召人員，未經長官之許可，不得參加任何集會或結社，已參加者在服役中應停止活動」，使軍隊不黨，軍人不黨。在舊兵役法同條第一款，原規定有「應宣誓效忠中華民國國民政府」一句，也因國民政府還政於民以後，是否仍其（舊稱尙不得而知，深恐國人誤會有强應徵應召人員效忠於國民黨之嫌，也把它自動删改爲「應宣誓效忠中華民國政府」。國民政府氣度的公正與大方，及希望和平統一的眞誠與殷切，於此更可窺見一斑。因此，我敢說新兵役法是超黨派的，是實施軍隊國家化的根本大法。</p>
<p>第二，新兵役法是本男女平等的原則，鼓勵女子服兵役。</p>
<p>在中國的政治地位上，男女平等是早已確定的，女子應享受的權利與應履行的義務，按照法理，應與男子相同。換句話說，男子服兵役，女子亦應服兵役。這不是一種理想或高調，這一次世界大戰的事實就可證明。根據美國一九四四年婦女新聞報導，美國有陸海軍婦女補助隊，各有十萬人，海防隊與海軍陸戰婦女隊各有二萬五千人。戰事結束，估計有二十五萬婦女由軍隊中退伍，美國國會竟有人提議，主張專爲婦女設立如同西點與安那浦立斯一般的陸海軍女子大學，以便訓練女子在軍事中担任正規工作。所以女子服兵役是今後必有的趨勢。我國在三十二年修正的兵役法的原案規定，「凡合於兵役年齡之女子，戰時得徵集服任軍事輔助勤務」，至平時應如何，未有明文規定，這次國防部修正時，特增「平時得施以軍事輔助動務敎育」，以便戰時服務勝任愉快。惟立洗院例會審議時，僉以目前我國敎育尙未普及，而文盲中尤以女子爲多，故普遍强迫施以軍事補助勤務敎育，事實上恐難辦到，因特加「依其志願」四字，其新兵役法第三十三條改爲，「合於木法第三條年齡之女子，平時得依共志願施以相當軍事補助勤務敎育，戰時得徵集服任軍事補助勤務，其徵集服務另以法律定之」。這完全聽憑女子自己的志願，而不加以强迫，自可適合國情了。兵役旣是國民應盡的光榮義務，希望忠勇前進的智識女子，淬勵奮發，踴躍受訓，爲戰時服役的準備。</p>
<p>第三，新兵役法提高服兵役者的身份資格。服兵役是國民應盡的義務，明恥教戰，捍衛國家，是最榮譽的事業。所以惟有健全的公民，才有參加的資格。遇去「好鐵不打釘，好人不當兵」的錯誤觀念，必須澈底剷除。唯有不許參加兵役的人，才是奇恥大辱。在新兵役法中規定服兵役的積極資格，雖祇規定（一）國籍，必須中華民國之國民，（二）性別—男子，（三）年齡—年滿十八歲至四十五歲，此外無其他嚴格條件。但在消極的資格方面，（一）凡身體畸形殘廢，或有痼疾者，免服兵役；（二）凡曾判處七年以上有期徒刑者，禁服兵役。較之三十二年修正兵役法原案規定「凡判處無期徒刑或褫奪公權終身者，禁服兵役」，其禁役的標準提高得多，並規定判處有期徒刑或褫奪公權經核准者予以停役。良民是良兵的基礎，良兵是良民的模範，新兵役法這種的修正，是必要的。</p>
<p>第四，新兵役法緊縮緩召緩征之範圍。在抗戰之初，實施征兵，乃依照二十二年六月公佈之兵役法，全文僅八條，將一切緩召緩征之決定，均授權於行政機關，斟酌事實情形予以決定。故當時對於緩召緩征之範圍，極爲廣泛，以致形成有錢者不當兵，有勢者不當兵，有智識者不常兵，距平等平允平均的、三平原則甚遠。同時，予執行兵役者以舞弊的機會。及三十二年修正兵役法，始特加以明文規定，予以限制。此次新兵役法，則更加以緊縮，如緩征的條件，原有六項，新兵役法僅採取其三項，，即（一）因公出國者，（二）高中以上學校學生未畢業者，（三）犯重罪在追訴中者。而將其餘的三項，則（一）身體疾病不堪行動，經證明確實者，（二）直系血親尊親屬或配偶死亡未滿一個月者，（三）獨負家庭生計責任無同胞兄弟者，一律删險。又緩召的條件，亦將三十二年之修正兵役法原有的（一）現任薦任以上官職經銓叙合格者，（二）現任正規警察者二項删除。這種規定，至少有三優點：第一，例外少，可以格外顯得平等平允平均；第二，兵源廣，可以增加優秀份子服兵役；而最大的優點是第三，可以以减少兵役人員的舞弊機會。因爲緩召緩征的範圍廣，條件多，就可以從中變通作弊的。</p>
<p>第五，新兵役法調整服兵役者享有之權利。三十二年修正兵役法實行於戰時，故對於現役兵享有的權利，不得不特別優待，以資鼓勵。如（一）應徵前所負債務，無力淸償時，得延至服役期滿後二年內淸償之自，（二）配偶及直系親屬得享受生活救濟之優待；（三）退伍後對於機關法團學校工廠之職務，有優先充任之權利；（四）勛賞撫卹及其他法令規定應享之權利。以上除第四項外，在平時似嫌過於優渥。新兵役法將現役兵享受權利，以「爲國服兵役」爲限，如爲私人爭地盤，爲政黨作工具，當不在其列。配偶及直系親屬生活之救濟，應在担任作戰勤務巾，且須其家庭確實不能維持生活時，始得享受。至「退伍後對於機關法團學校工廠之職務有優先充任「權利」一項，亦與人盡其才的原則不合，頗難做到，這次復員官兵改禁的困難，即是明證。所以新兵役法改爲「應征應如時學生准保留學籍，職工准保留底缺，無職業者退伍復員後，有優先就業之權利」。至於債務之淸償，應從民法及一般之規定，故不復採取。蓋兵役制度普遍推行後，全國皆兵，大家都是一樣，對於私權利的享受，不應再有特殊規定了。</p>
<p>第六，新兵役法分常備兵役，補充兵役，國民兵役三種。</p>
<p>以前的兵役，僅分國民兵役與常備兵役二種，新兵役法則另增補充兵役一種。在新兵役法第八條規定，補充兵役分爲現役預備役二種：現役，凡適合常備兵現役之超額男子，視國防需要，每年征集一部入營，由常備師或管區施以四個月至六個月之訓練，期滿退伍，服預備役，至屆滿四十五歲止除役。這種規定，爲常備兵役之補充。因爲國家財力有限，平時不能徵集大量適齡壯丁入營服常備兵役，只能在經徵兵檢査合格人員巾抽籤一部份入營，但一旦國防上發生問題，需要多量兵源時，如以國民兵補充，素質似嫌過差，故另增補充兵役之一級，入營受四至六個月之軍事訓練，以備不時之補充。平時與戰事兼顧，不失爲進步之一着。</p>
<p>第七，新兵役法重新規劃管理機構。兵役度制，供應作戰兵源，爲建國圖强唯一要圖，尤爲一切軍政的始基，故應由中央政府統一辦理，維持獨立機構與系統，不假手於地方政府。過去於省設軍管區，省以下設師管區團管區，其管區之範圍，與地方行政區域一致，而不以人口多寡爲對象，以致兵額支配頗有軒輊，而其權復操之於省主席兼軍管區司令之手。故此次新兵役法，重新建立各管區機構，取消軍管區制，而以人口爲標準，劃分全國爲若干師管區及團管區，設置師團管區司令部，受常地軍事高級機關指揮監督，分別辦理各該管區內之兵役及其有關事務（見第十六條、）。縣市長爲縣市征兵官，受該管管區司令之指揮監督，辦理區內兵役及其有關事務，完全是屬於委辦事項。至省政府主席與院邊轄市市長，爲徵兵監督，僅負協助之責，不復爲軍管區司令，以維持獨立的兵役制度，少受地方政府的牽掣。專權集巾，爲其特點之一。</p>
<p>第八，新兵役法特別重視海空之發展。海空軍在國防上應特別重視，其理由至爲明顯，無待　述。海空軍人的體力：智力標準，需要特別嚴格，也是事實。在過去的修正兵役法，可以說完全以陸軍兵役爲主體，對於海空軍，僅在附則中輕描淡寫的列這樣一條「海空之兵役，除法得有特別規定外，準用本法之規定」。次新兵役法中，則另列海空軍專章，並明文規定「凡適合常備丘現役，其體力智力合於海空軍軍官佐役，軍士役，兵卒役時，得儘先以志願者征集之。如自願者不足征額時，得就合格者以抽籤決定之。」海空軍兵役列入專章，這是第一次，其重視海空軍自可想見。</p>
<p>總之，兵役法是國家的大法，實爲國家樹立建軍的基礎，其重要不亞於操典。這次新兵役法的修訂，使成爲旣不受時間空間的限制，也不受政治上的影響的最可寶貴的偉大法典，同時軍隊國家化亦即以此爲始基。我們旣欽佩國民政府立法超黨派的氣度，而一般國民更應認識新兵役法意義的重大，及其特色之所在，忠實奉行，踴躍應徵，以樹立國防建軍的基礎。</p>

<h3>美國工業革命回溯</h3>
<p>— 嚴皓英</p>
<p>在十八世紀末，十九世紀初的時候，當歐洲的人民移殖到美洲的時候，他們必定將歐洲所用的手工方法，帶入美洲，這是很自然的一件事實。　至工業革命發生的時候，歐洲人民勢又必將新發明的製造方法，帶人美國，這也是很自然的。可是英國政府已經很快地見到這些新機械在商業上底利益，而發布嚴令禁止各種機械底圖書，輸出到外洋各國，或殖民地———所以美國人民就只得自己努力去謀各種新機械底發明，但都沒有顯著的成績。直至一七九〇年，斯雷忒（Samuel　Slater）爲羅得島（Rhode　Island）彼塔刻特（Pawtucket）底阿爾美布拉文（Almy　and　Brown）工廠構造幾個阿克來底紡機，纔可算有些成功。斯雷忒是一個英籍的靑年，從前曾在阿克來底同事斯特剌特（Strutt）處工作，所以對於這種機械，到有些經騐。他所造的紡機可以回時轉動七十二個紡錘，其工廠底外觀很壯觀。此外其他各處在同時期也有九部紡機構造出來，但都沒有斯雷忒底成績那樣顯著。因之斯雷忒底工廠就被認爲美國工廠制度　胚胎，而斯雷忒就被認爲美國製造事業底鼻祖了。至在一所工廠內而能　自原料一直織成布疋的，則在全世界中，票算　爾坦（Woltham）在一八一四年所建的工廠爲最早。</p>
<p>這些早年的工廠當然都是仿照英國底辦法其規模底大小，也常常爲可得底水力所限。雖然該地底人民，在很早的時候，就顯出有特殊的工業技能，因之使新英格蘭底名望格外顯著。但手工的工藝利手工的工業，在別的職業中還是繼續繁盛好幾年，而新工廠制度底發展；在十九世紀底初葉，也比較地遲緩。</p>
<p>關於這時工業情形底報告最早的而最可靠的，是一八五〇年底戶口調查報告。這時製造二字還是很廣義地包括任何機　底工作，而且在有組織的工廠之外，還加上　築工業和手工工業二種。據這個報告，這個時期工業出品底總値，一共可値美金五萬萬元，而一八四九年所有工廠平均出品額則値四三〇〇元。此外其他現代工業生活底特徵，在那時也漸漸地打的基礎。例如從事國內外貿易的商業階級，就在這時發展起來；而我們近代工業生活中所常見的製造業，運輪業躉賣業和零售業底種種組合，也一一地在這時發現。而且當商業底範　漸漸擴大，工業底規模漸漸發展的時候，那些，專供給工商業資本爲職業的企業家、也因金融問題底緊張而應時興起了。</p>
<p>到了十九世紀底後半，美國王業，突然發展，無論在出品底價値上或數量一都使　國自幼稚工業的地位，一躍而登世界領袖的地位，可是這種情形，都不是沒有原因的。第一因爲該國底人口激增，國內市塲當然不能不隨之而擴大。第二因爲該國這時已經完全開拓，天產原料，非常豐富，而可耕的士地和煤　的產額，又是極爲充足。第三最爲重要的，一方呢，因爲該國企求進步的慾望，使發明家工程家，和製造家們都知道手藝移　原則底重要。一方呢，因爲該國公開坦白的態度，使他國上等的技術會源源不絕地傳人美國。所以最終該國居然能够發展一種大規模的生產方法，以儘量利用各種新發明的製造方法，幷使分工制底用途越發可以擴充。我們只要看到該國　表，縫機，割刈機，汽車等製造就可以知道該國在製造上底種種特徵，如出品數額底巨大，出品標準底劃一，和出品各部分底可以互相交換，已經和仍舊大半依靠手藝的歐州方法，大不相同了，所以在一八九九年的時候，美國　國製造品底一總値，就高至一〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇元其中由手工造成的還不及十分之一所謂大企業的世界，可謂已經開始了，到了一九〇四年，美國全國製造品中由每年可以出貨一〇〇，〇〇〇元以上的工廠製造出來的，共佔百分之七九。三，一九一四年這種比例又增至百分之八四六。</p>
<p>美國工廠制度在這個時期所以能够突飛猛進是有一個很重要的原因，就是蒸汽機底發明已使一個工廠底規模可以沒有限制地擴充。這個原因底影響，尤以發常機和電力散佈法（ElectricalDiotribution　of　Energy）發明以後更爲明顯因爲這些方法和電燈，業已根本改革工廠底建造比較一百年前全靠水力來轉動機械的工廠進步了，此外汽機之應用於水陸運輸方面，也是一個很重要的進步，他不但有助於製造品底行銷，而且也使原料運至工業中心更加便利所以在起始的時候，所有各種新發明的紡織機，雖然都要依靠水力，而且水力也是當時所能得到的唯一能力，而自汽機發明以後工廠底地位，就不必一定設在近水的地方了。而且運輸方法旣然改良，不但工人底羣聚，和機械底集中在經營上可以辦得到就是完成的製造品，也可以更易分散到各處去這又是增加生產方法底效率以外的一個利益。此外從前因爲運輸不便的緣故，各地離開工廠較遠的手藝工人，常常可以和工廠競爭；現在這種競爭也無形消滅了。可是運輸方法底本身，也常常隨着生產方法底進步而進步，因爲生產方法旣然改進，人們也就用新的生產方法來構造運輸底機械。</p>
<p>除了以上各種發明以外，我們還要加上電報電話，無綫電機其他種種改良的交通方法。這些東西都是在商業上有應用底可能，而且幾乎爲全體人們日用品和便利品；可是牠們底用途所以能够這樣普遍還是要依賴着近代的生產方法，所以交通和運輸底進步固然可以幫助生產方法底改良，而生產方法底改良，又可以翻轉來使交通和運輸底效率，越發提高；這些生產機分配制度底非常的發展，實在是從前的人所不曾見到的，換一句說，生產工具底進化和交通方法底進化，本來是鼓勵人們去向前努力的最早的三大問題現在這些東西已同時發展到我們祖先所不曾夢見的地步，而使工業制度底效率也發展到人力幾乎難以控制的地步。</p>
<h3>農塲收入與農地價格</h3>
<p>— 鍾德祺譯</p>
<p>農地市塲價格與農塲收入之開係極大，但我國則對此問題極少注意，本文作者露易斯（Ardron　B．Lewis）爲美國著名農業經濟學者。於民國二十二年十月來華講學，並參加「中國土地利用」調查，任統計主任，至二十五年六月始去職，曾撰寫「中國土地利用」中「物價與賦稅」一章，現任職美國際敎育局（Infernational　Training　Acministration），對我國農業極爲關切，今特向我國提出此問題，並希與美國共同硏究比較，茲譯出以供各方參考。　譯者附誌。</p>
<p>現在戰爭已經勝利，中國，美國及其他各國的農業經濟學者可以再掉轉他們的全部注意於各種建設工作，而特別著重在永久及主要有益的硏究上。有很多農業經濟事實中的關係是管理法令還不能充分解釋的。其中一個就是農塲收入與農地市塲價格之關係。在戰前我在美國調查的結果，表示出農場的總價値—，土地，建築，牲畜及工具—在不同經濟等級的土地中，是與各種等級土地的「每人之報酬」（Return　prn　man）（譯者按：「人」指「入工等數」（Man—cquivaleut）成比例關係的。「每人的報酬」是塲主，農塲地王和農塲僱工以這年在農塲中，所工作的「人工年數」（Man　years），（譯者按：成年男工在田塲一日工作十小時者，即稱爲一個人工單位，如全年工作者，可稱爲一人工年）總數分得的總收入，常常是田塲地主算一「人工年」，塲主算一「人工年」，不管田塲是塲主所有或否。</p>
<p>如果上面的原則成立，則跟着就有很多有趣的結論。而且那些結論將會影響政府關係農貸，農塲租稅，和地價等的政策。爲了試騐這種原則。兩種農業經濟研究的基本工具是需要的，即農塲管理調查記錄和土地經濟分類地圖，金陵大學農業經濟系在很多硏究中是已經作過而且都利用過這些工具，自然，將來也會繼續利用。</p>
<p>在建立農業經濟原則中，中美兩國應該雙方硏究，而且兩國的農業經濟學者，應該繼續互相觀察和糾正對方的工作，兩個國家所建立的原則是可能靠得住；而且兩國問任何一個原則的不同顯示，將會給我們很多敎訓，而且領導我們去發現更遠的眞理。</p>
<h3>互商管理概論</h3>
<p>— 徐百益</p>
<p>成本會議與薄記　生產機構問題之六</p>
<p>要討論這一種工作的時候，先要從實行的决序講起，在管理部分通知生產的部份開始工作的時候，一定要一種手續，這一種手續，我們可以稱之謂通知單，這通知單的數目可以隨情形而定，通常是三張，）張給生產部份、一張給成本曾計部份，一張由管理部份存留，成本會計部份，就可以拿這通知單做根據，然後根據原料單（由生產部份向棧房取用原料的時候）定有一種單據）可以訊錄所需要的原料，根據付出的工資單，可以記錄所用的工資，這一項比較地簡單，比較複雜的是開支方面的支配。</p>
<p>對於開支方面，可以分爲固定的和不固定的二種，像房租，保險，捐稅，拆舊，光熱，電等都可以說是固定的，即便有超出也是很有限的數目，至於其他各節，那末隨時可以有伸縮的。</p>
<p>對於固定的開支，那末他們的分配有幾種方法：</p>
<p>A關於房租方面的開支以地位計算，例如某一家工廠共有多少方尺的地位，就可以由所付房租方面計算出每一方尺的代價是多少。舉例來說明：某廠北有地位三千方尺，每月所付房租是三萬元，那末就是平均每方尺的地位的代價是十元，如果管理部份所佔的地位是五百方尺那末在房租項下，管理部份應負担五千元的支出，反轉來講就是有五千元是爲管理部份所佔去的地位而支付的。</p>
<p>B光燈和熱度的開支，以地位計算</p>
<p>C電力以實際消耗量，平均計算</p>
<p>D其他各項：隨着情形而定奪</p>
<p>舉例說明</p>
<p>警如說，我們所製造的一件貨品，某一批總共製造一千件，所用的開支如下</p>
<p>一，原料（根據原料單據方面所記載的實際消耗量）五萬元</p>
<p>二，工資（總共製造日期是五天每天平均工資五千元）二萬五千元</p>
<p>三，開支</p>
<p>管理（以五天計算）二萬元</p>
<p>房租（以五天計算）五千元</p>
<p>保險（以五天計算）一千元</p>
<p>捐稅（以五天計算）一千元</p>
<p>折舊（以五天計算）二千元</p>
<p>光熱電力（以五天計算）二千元</p>
<p>總共是十萬零六千元，那末就是每件貨品的成本是一百零六元。</p>

<h3>小說瑣談</h3>
<p>— 振子</p>
<p>平妖全傳</p>
<p>「平妖全傳」，明人撰，孫楷第「中國通俗小說書目」卷二「明淸講史部」著錄，無卷數回數。記云：「馬隅卿藏明本，殘存卷二至卷五四卷，卷五止於六十回，不知全書之卷數回數。」又云：『明無名氏撰，題「吳興會極淸隱居士編决」，「洪都瀛海嬾仙居士參閱」你　，「彭城雙龍延平處士訂正」，演天啓間徐鴻儒叛亂事。』「書目」成於民國二十二年春，所見僅有馬藏殘本。同年長樂鄭氏始得全書於北平，書內「東夷」，「撻虜」均被挖改，當是淸初翻印本。全書凡六卷七十二回，演天啓二年白蓮敎徒徐鴻儒倡亂山東蔓延各地事。書題「新編皇明通俗演義七曜平妖全傳」，而原書卷首却題「新編皇明通俗演義七曜平妖後全卷之一」，揆其初稱當是「平妖後傳」，以續「三遂平妖傳」者；後乃改名「平妖全傳」，將「後」字挖改爲「全」，而挖改卷一時偶不當心移下一字，遂誤「後傳」爲「後全」。書首有天啓四年甲子文光斗序，則成書時亦當相距不遠，離徐鴻儒倡亂僅有二年，蓋亦當時「今聞」小說。文序略述亂事經過，中云：「吾友會極，且覩其顚末而視奕者也，乃爲之傳，以紀其治亂之由。寓褒貶于美刺之中，設宿以滅祟，用術以平妖。此中以幻易幻，藉假發之義也。」又云：「會極，吳興氏，爲淮南十洲太史公孫。浪遊湖海，笑傲乾坤，笥百家於內，會性命于中，物外人也。」</p>
<p>按書題「吳興會極淸隱居士」，則淸隱居士自是別署，會極當爲其字或號，而吳興則沈氏之世系所由出，是作者當爲沈會極。會極旣爲沈十洲之孫，亦不無綫索可尋。按十洲名坤，淮安人，嘉靖二十年進士，以一甲一名授翰林院修撰，掌南翰院，居喪時値倭寇侵入，集鄉兵大破之，後爲人所訐告，赴詔獄。著有「沈祭酒集」。十洲與吳承恩友善，「射陽存稿」中有「贈沈十洲」，「贈翰林院修撰儒林郞沈公合葬墓志銘」等詩文。「墓志銘」爲十洲父煒作（撰於嘉靖三十五年丙辰），其記煒之後云：『曾孫男三：　庚，聘陸氏；　甲，聘金氏；　辛，聘張氏。』煒之曾孫即坤之孫，是會極之名亦當爲　口。此庚，甲諸人，疑是會極兄輩，而非會極。當吳氏撰「墓志銘」時，沈坤年僅五十（正德二年丁卯生，西歷一五〇七，據范以煦「淮流一勺」卷下「沈祭酒殿試册書後」會試時年三十五計。），其孫年必甚幼。假定庚等三人彼時的十歲（已聘），至天啓四年撰小說時，已是七十餘歲之老翁，恐怕無一此興緻。故會極當是　庚等之弟，吳氏撰文時尚未生，世系巾無名。沈氏後裔式微，譜牒亦未見，否則常不難一考也。又沈坤文　開程氏藏有抄本，兵燹中故意拆毀，未見，不識其中曾涉及會極否？</p>
<h3>滿文小說譯者</h3>
<p>漢文通俗小說之譯爲滿文者，據孫楷第「中國通俗小說書目」附錄（五）「滿文譯本小說簡目」所載，計有：「前七國」，「三國演義」，「金瓶梅」，「水滸傳」，一覺世名　」，「　支　」，「迎城壁」，「賽紅絲」，「兩交婚」，「歸蓮夢」，「八洞人」，「三敎同理小說」（三種），「　史演義」，「平山冷燕」，「西遊記」，「後西遊記」十八種及他書四種而已。僅於「聊齋志異」題扎克丹譯，「可信錄」題　　　，餘均未著譯者　。</p>
<p>按就孫書所著錄者言之，其中譯者亦有可知者。</p>
<p>陳康祺「燕下鄉脞錄」卷十云：「羅貫中「三國演義」，多取材於陳　習　齒之書，不盡子虛烏有也。太宗崇德四年，命大學士達海譯「孟子」，「通鑑」，「六韜」，兼及是書，未竣。順治七年，演義告竣，大學士范文肅公文程等　賞　馬銀幣有差。國初滿洲武將不識漢文者，頗多得力於此。』是「三國演義」一書之譯者爲達海，范文程等，疑達海，范文程二人乃總其事者，未必全書悉出二人之手，蓋內廷著書大抵署首事者之名也。又謂演義於順治七年告成，按「審目」載北平圖書館，故宮博物院各藏有順治七年滿漢合　刋本一，當是此書之最早刻本。</p>
<p>汲修主人昭　「嘯亭續錄」卷一「翻書房」條云：一有户　郞中和素者，翻譯絕精，其翻「西廂記」，「金瓶梅」諸書，疏節字句，咸中綮肯，人皆爭誦焉。』據此則兩書譯者當爲和素其人。然伍某（拉納子）「批本隨園詩話「於原書卷五記徐　園事批云：『繙譯「金瓶梅」，即出徐蝶園手，其滿漢文爲本朝第一。蝶園姓舒穆魯，滿洲正白旗人，然與開國功臣正黃旗之楊古利，雖亦姓舒穆魯，非一族也。』按袁氏「詩話」謂徐蝶園名元夢，康熙癸丑進士。此謂徐氏所譯，與昭　說異。「書目」記「金瓶梅」有康熙四十七年刻本，與徐元夢年代相及；至和素時代則不詳。　索八旗文獻，問題常不難解決，惜南中不易得書耳。</p>
<h3>槳</h3>
<p>— 石碚</p>
<p>在外灘公園，我獨自坐在靠黃浦江邊的椅子上，靜靜地望着波瀾動蕩的江心。那些密密列隊的挺着肥滿肚子的龐大的輪船，塞住遙遙的一邊江面，烟囱裏冒出烏黑的濃烟，烟霧遮蓋了一邊天；在空中搖動的旗子也看不見了，只能看見發出强光的電燈。不少輕巧的裝着馬達的小火輸，像紡紗機上的梭子，不停地撞着飄着，飛濺白色的浪花，像一堆亂麻，拖在屁股後面。在這昻揚巨型的潑辣小型的火輪中間，挾着我們一隻小木船，這是唯一靠人力搖槳的小船兒，牠與那些龐然大物，和跳躍小鬼，便形成了黃浦江上兩種鮮明的對照，——一個是尖說的，一個是沉鬱的情調。</p>
<p>木船後面繫着一枝長長詞曲的大槳，憑着這枝大獎，才能够把船推進，或者左右擺動方向。先起是父親母親，和年輕的女兒搖着，這六隻手拼命地握在吊着大獎的繩子上，搖呀搖的，他們整個身體，也隨着繩子搖動了。浪濤衝激他們的船，他們瞧着前面，不慌不急，盡力地搖。不一會兒，那　在船尾的老人，也站起來攀着繩子，不聲不響地和他們一同搖着船槳。這老人大槪是祖父了，皺摺迷惘的眼睛，注視一個從前面猛衝而來的火輪，一陣大浪掀來，他們幾個人的身體，完全與這繩子絞紐在一起了。</p>
<p>不知爲什麽，我只愛着這隻小木船，我的限睛跟着牠移動。對着江上這兩種不調和的情調，我是同情這小木船的渺小，抑是担心他們會被浪濤掩沒的厄運呢？我說不出自己的感覺……</p>
<p>這老人頭髮已經花白了，他搖着這枝槳，已經搖了一輩子了，現在他的後兩代，又要搖着這枝槳！他們要搖到什麽時候，才能完結呢？勁力搖盡了，但是，江上的水是永遠搖不靜的呵！</p>
<p>在南方的故鄉，從鄉間進城去，必要趁小木船渡江，每次我跟母親趁船進城時，我愛看在船側搖動的兩枝槳，愛聽搖槳的老人訴說生活的狀况；老人的兒子另有一隻小木船每天他也是替人擺渡搖槳。夏秋兩季江水漲潮的時候，我們便可看見老人的孫兒，站在船頭帮忙搖槳了。我記得有一次母親對我說過：「他們三代，就是靠着一枝槳活着哩！」這些久遠的記憶，現在又鮮明的喚回眼前了。</p>
<p>人生像一個無邊的汪洋，槳是我們每一個人不能缺少的生活工具，在茫茫的江面，在澎湃的海洋，在熙攘的地上，……各種人把握着各種不同的生活之槳，爲了求生，我們不停的搖呀！</p>
<p>憶起故鄉搖槳的老人，眼前又看見正在搖着一枝船槳的三代，我要鼓起勇氣，我要搖動我自已的槳呵！</p>
<h3>餞行</h3>
<p>— 謝梓文</p>
<h3>記向培良</h3>
<p>— 趙景深</p>
<p>向培良是狂　社的幹部，與高長虹齊名。阿英的「史料索引」（中國新文學大系）上說他是「戲劇家，批評家，湖南黔陽人。竹主編靑春月刋。著作甚多，主要者有「人類的藝術」，「中國戲劇概評」，「光明的戲劇」，「沉悶的戲劇」，「紫歌劇集」，「英雄與美人」，「我離開十字街頭」等。」　裏面「中國戲劇槪評」一種我曾經仔細地讀過，因爲當時我正編着「中國文學小史」，而當時系統地論述中國新文學的書極少，新以這一本書特別使我注意並且　歡。</p>
<p>前幾天，他留着許地山一樣的　子，月光烱烱有神，拄着拐杖到我家裏來看我。我對於他這拐杖很感興趣。記得十幾年前我們倆一同在城內的女子文學專門學校裏演講，他就已經拄着一根拐杖。我說：「你這根拐杖用了十幾年了吧？」他說是去年從他哥哥那兒拿的，他的那一根已經丟掉了。</p>
<p>他談起在無錫國學專　館敎了幾年書，跟着學校到處遷移，從桂林搬到各處去逃難。有一次曾經逃到搖民的窰洞裏。他們除了猺話以外，也能够說桂林官話，所以語言毫不隔閡，跳月的風俗也沒有了。我希望他把各地的風土人情記錄下來，一定很有興趣，能够增廣我們的見聞。</p>
<p>國專搬回無錫時，他常與周貽白晤面，國專與周寓相距甚近，無錫又沒有多少朋友，所以他們倆的來往很密，貽白也常向他談起我。</p>
<p>最近培良在蘇州拙政園內社會教育學院專任戲劇的課程，這當然是出色當行的。記得　前他在漢口一所藝術專門學校裏敎過好幾年藝術學和美學，對於這方面的硏究也是頗爲精湛的。</p>
<h3>秋夜</h3>
<p>— 啸風</p>
<p>剔亮了燈，坐近窗前，諦聽着窗外的雨聲。我聽見這秋夜的風，搖撼着後園的竹叢，發出了細碎的繁　。我聽見這寒宵的雨滴，正從屋簷邊溜滴下來，一聲聲地敲打着簷下的階石。在這風雨的秋夜裏，我開始感覺到凄凉，寂寞，更勾起了我無限的回憶。</p>
<p>我記起了八年前的一個秋夜裏，在一條泥濘古道上，我和同學們在黑暗中摸索。那時，我們正從一個小鎭上宣傳歸來，秋天的雨，淋濕了我們的衣服，淋碎了我們「抗敵宣傳隊」的旗子。雖然我們摸索在這泥濘道上，跌倒在泥田裏，然而我們爽朗的歌聲和笑語聲，却像我們的熱情般的飛迸。</p>
<p>我又記起了在一個風風雨雨的秋夜裏，我遭受了生活的鞭策，而單獨地奔走於荒涼的路途上。在那廣闊的原野中，沒有客店，沒有燈火，我只有懷着無限的恐怖。在這茫茫的暗夜裏奔波，那時，我多麼的渴望光明，多麽的嚮往於溫暖啊！我希望在一閒小小的茅棚下，趨避這秋夜的風雨。</p>
<p>我埋下頭，閉上了眼睛，默默地想着，在这數年後的今夜裏，我更珍惜那許多陳舊的苦難的回憶。</p>
<p>忽然，從窗外飄來一兩聲低微的呻吟，像誰在這風雨的秋夜夜裏，悠悠的歎息。我推開窗子，探頭四顧，我要找尋出這呻吟的處所。街道已顯出了凄凉的樣子，電燈的光也似乎變得暗淡了，只有一輛射出光柱的小汽軍，慢慢的在泥　中駛過。</p>
<p>借助於微弱的燈光，我看到對面一帶曲折的房屋，在牆壁的深入處，蜷伏着一個蓬頭的乞兒。當風在雨急的時候，他在微微的動顫着，盡量使自己的身體和牆壁接得更近，微弱的呻吟，代替了他深心的咀咒。</p>
<p>夜半，當我從夢中醒來時，風雨已經停息了，一綫昏暗的夜月光芒，正透過了紙窗的縫隙，凄然的撒落在書案上。我閉上了眼睛，靜靜地傾聽這深夜的世界，我聽見窗外的桐葉，在微風裏飄零，籟籟的細響，有如老年人的輕喟。凄凄的秋蟲聲，正在替這凋　樹葉的不幸而悲泣。</p>
<p>我又聽見了，從窗外飄來的那低微的呻吟，我想到了這是秋的季節，在秋季的後面，正隱藏着那一串嚴寒的冬日。雖然冬天過去了，春天便會來到，春天的陽光，會解除了　人們的威脅。可是，這酷寒的季節，還是多麼的長啊！</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血　　62</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>我同虎弟一商量，想　汽車走，但汽車不僅價錢高，而且不準包到，不能過去，就得打　票，還不退綫。我們正談着，瞥見一個鄉下打扮的婦人，逕直跑到我們這裏「借光，」說不認得字，問牌上什麼時候有車。我們倆仔細打量了那婦人一下，便由我告訴她，「寫是寫的七點，可時間已經過了。迎票都沒賣。」</p>
<p>這婦人獨自嘟噥着，「四十多里地，叫人怎麼走？等罷咧，反正得開車。」說着便把自己的小提包放在我們身邊，挨在我們椅子上坐下來了。一會牠又問我們上那裏？雙橋？通州？可是姊弟？這是親戚？還是隣舍？我們不大理會，只含糊說是親戚。</p>
<p>「你們大槪是上通州？」她過了一會又問着我們。我正想再敷衍她一句，預備換一個地方坐，就在這時候，虎弟輕輕拐了我一下，突地站了起來，指着車站食堂說，「小姨，咱們吃點什麼去。」說着提了他的小包和我的小提箱，逕自走了。我向那婦人點了點顯，跟着也走開。</p>
<p>我們本來商量過，從此叫虎弟叫我大姐姐，因我喜歡叫他虎弟弟。但虎弟怕將來回家給他媽駡，堅決不肯，雖不喊「紀姨，」必得喊「姨，」大姨，二姨，三姨。後來說我比他母親說小得太多，就喊小姨罷。這時伙，一用手時拐我，知道他也必有所見，也只好不跟那婦人搭腔了。</p>
<p>我們眞的到站上食堂裏坐下了。早晨雖在總部吃過早飯，因恐耽誤，無心吃下，這時車子沒來，也正想找補點。至於虎弟，他一日二十四小時，除了睡熟了之外，無時不能吃，可以吃得不住口。</p>
<p>我們正向跑堂的要着點心，那跑堂的一邊應着，却向窗外　了一眼。我跟着向外一看，却不見什麽，只好像有一個人影窗晃動了一下，跑堂的去了，食堂只我們　人；雖有兩三個打　的，却站得很遠，我便問虎弟「怎麽說」虎弟美　告訴我，他一點沒猜錯，那婦人好岔眼，不　趕　的，果然我們過來，她也來偸着在窗外張。</p>
<p>我很佩服虎弟能隨地留心，竟比較我受渦特殊訓練的人，也不差什麽。原來那卿下人，乍一走來，我已經覺得她有些岔眼，她的衣裝打扮，大槪沒經過正式訓練，竟違犯了偵探化裝學上的一個基本忌條—均一律—換句話說，一切化裝衣着，必須跟自已本身皮相，慣常，動作，等項，得一律相稱。所以偵探術化裝學上說；「與其化裝，不能做到均一地步，不如本色來得簡易；故非萬不得，而造詣相當深到，寗可本色」。換句話說，化裝之後，簡眞要顧到一切，不能有一點不均一的地方。</p>
<p>這隊伙誰說是村婦打扮，她的一雙手，那們剎嫩，指甲，掌紋，那們整潔，除了洗臉，簡直不下水的那種保養成績，很明顯的罷在那裏；其餘如眼神的靈活，犀利，頭髮的汕潤整齊，行動的故意做作等等，那　有些村婦意味，簡直像話劇場十上的摸倣動作，所以也更不用再仔細觀察了。</p>
<p>照我本意，本來想同她開開玩笑，至少也應不動聲色，怎麽來怎麽應付。因爲碰到這一類的人，最好聽其自然；，否則，一有　動或逃避，反而被她證實。無　虎弟一發見　岔眼，使不耐煩同　周旋，幸虧我們的動作都很自然，故此也無需乎過于八　小怪。至）至於那傢伙跑到窗外來張看，更顯得本領平常了。不過　虎弟說，曾經見她向　面的跑堂的打過手勢　。</p>

<h3>性命根本</h3>
<p>— 少夫</p>
<p>馮玉祥將軍奉派赴美考察水利去了，臨行之前，曾上書蔣主席，信中共五點，最後一點說：</p>
<p>風紀敗壞，危險之極，職司多貪污，行政少效率，民心太萎靡，文化不發皇。而允顯著者，莫過軍紀之廢弛，官常之不振，今日官吏欺民，軍隊擾民，無不肆意爲之。即以通都大邑而言，憲警打百姓，軍警相毆鬥，憲警相衝突，何地無之，此爲性命根本之事，數十百年不易培成，而今掃地以盡。</p>
<p>這段話說得太沉痛了，我們如果翻撿這一月來的報紙，上海的電車，公共汽車的好幾次罷工事件，就可以證實馮玉祥將軍的話是有鐵的事實作根據的。</p>
<p>馮將軍自稱丘八，他是行伍出身，有幾十年的軍中生活經騐，他看到這情形而大聲疾呼「危險之極」，實在嚴重透了！</p>
<p>問題的癥結還在敎育，敎育程度不够，使許多人不大能明白理性，一知半解尤其糟糕，因爲他們會編造一套似是而非的理由來歪曲是非。愚之外，還有一個貧字，俗語說，窮極無聊，一個人無聊還顧什麼道德法律？</p>
<p>這都是社會的病態，而它的影響是會及於整體的。馮將軍上書蔣主席請「力求防範糾正，以挽在瀾」，我認爲我們也得負責任，每個人要爲道德法律做好事之徒，有犧牲勇氣；祛除「莫管他人瓦上霜」的不澈底的自觀念。</p>

<h3>荷印僑胞　血淚相和流</h3>
<p>— 魯鈍父</p>
<p>—送李宣慰使赴荷印</p>
<p>荷印宣慰使李迪俊氏，已在赴程中了。國府特派大員往荷印，這還是破天荒第一次。據李氏臨行對記者發表此行任務，第一是對荷印僑胞作精神上的慰問，第二是調查當地僑胞所歷受的苦痛與壓迫，供給政府參考。數百年來，荷印的僑胞，受盡了外人與土人雙重欺凌，受盡了荷人對僑胞不平等待過的管束，從一七四〇年「紅河之役」一直到勝利後的「坦其隆慘案」，最近還不斷傳來巴眼等地方華僑被殺害的消息，把這筆舊脹，細細算來，眞是血淚斑斑，說不盡的悲憤與酸辛！</p>
<p>華僑的南移荷印，在唐宋時已經開始，明代鄭和七下南洋時，華僑在荷印地方已有相當勢力。後爪哇，蘇門答臘爲荷蘭所佔，因開闢需人，很歡迎華僑前往。由於僑胞的耐苦忍勞，刻意經商，人數日多，在商業上操執牛耳，遭荷人所嫉妬，遂常受虐待，荷蘭官吏習向華僑索詐，荷人認爲無正當職業者，或處以酷刑，或竟投之海中。歷史上慘絕人寰的「紅河之役」，僑胞死難者凡一萬餘人。照理說，中國政府應該亟謀對策，保護僑胞們的安全，而當時淸帝乾隆竟聲稱：「海外僑民，並非大淸子民，朝庭概不過問」。</p>
<p>虐待與殘殺</p>
<p>民國以來，僑胞的橫被屠殺，更屢見記載。民國十六年，國民黨東婆羅洲支部執行委員岑菊鄰，及駐生瓦生瓦分部主席鄧謙懷，被荷蘭官警無理逮捕，僑胞向荷當局要求釋放，反被開槍射擊，死傷四五十人，並捕去多名。事後國民政府向荷政府提出抗議，荷蘭不理，反將岑鄧二氏驅逐出境，並將僑胞十餘人予以監禁。</p>
<p>華僑所受殘殺及歧視，不獨荷人爲然，當地土人，因見僑胞占有經濟勢力，不免如恨，加以荷人從中推波助瀾。因此兇焰益高。殘殺僑胞之舉，時有所聞，著名如「古突士慘案」，被殺華人十一名，財物被搶五十萬盾，焚毀房屋十九間。而事後荷政府並未賠償損失，而中國領事也不得干預其事。</p>
<p>一九〇九年起，中國雖有領事駐在荷印的大概　　，泅水，棉　，巴東各地，而在外交上無權邊問，形同虛設。而東印度政府，向有「漢務司」的設立，雇用敗類華人，爲非作惡，使僑胞所受痛苦，更進一層！</p>
<p>無母的孤兒</p>
<p>華僑入境荷印，其條例的苛刻，手續的麻煩，無出其右。先在船上繳納所謂「人口稅」一百盾，託人担保，領得「登坡字」，方可以上岸，還有什麽担保妻子手續，領「王字」等，使你纏得頭搭腦漲。據他們的「入境居留條例」，凡是荷政府認爲「不能謀生自養」或「恐有危及法律之虞」的華僑，都可任意拒絕其登岸。蔡元培先生就是被他們藉口「危及治安」而不許上岸的一位</p>
<p>華僑居留在荷印的，有二百萬人之多，構成了荷印國民生活中的主要部分依照民族自決的立塲，是和印尼同樣是荷印的主人，况且已居住了有數百年的歷史，自稱「僑民」，乃是「客氣」的話，像如此橫遭欺凌歧視，難道還能就此這樣地讓他下去，使僑胞們永無安寗之日嗎？</p>
<p>這次李氏前往荷印，荷印僑民，飽經戰禍，創痛至深，戰後復遭印尼排華屠殺，自有宣慰的必要；更希望於學氏的，在調查得僑胞在荷印身受之各項痛苦後，報告政府，迅速實施護僑政策，廢止一切對僑胞的不平等條例，保障僑胞的安全和自由！</p>

<h3>倮倮同胞的來信</h3>
<p>— 梨黎阿閏</p>
<p>（編者按：二日刋載一鶴君「關於倮倮」一文後，有倮倮同胞「梨黎阿閏」者，認爲所述倮倮殺害漢胞一節不確，基於團結的熱誠，投書本刋，有所辯護，我們非常珍視這位倮倮同胞的熱情，特將原信披露，不過關於對原作者過分指責的地方，則予保留，因爲我們希望，倮倮同胞和我們，一點隔膜都不存在。又這位倮倮靑年寫得一手流利國文，令人佩服，其中文字方面除了很少的地方略爲酌易數字外，大部都是原投書者的原筆。）</p>
<p>一鶴先生：</p>
<p>在申報上先後的看見了有關西南夷苗民族的兩件事情，就是；一，猓猓部落間有爭戰，二，關於「倮倮」（刋於自由談）</p>
<p>不至如此</p>
<p>第一件事先生旣沒有提及，亦與本文無關，我們不必多費紙筆。先就第二件事情來談吧！先生說；「倮倮」以殺害漢人爲榮，更以年老漢人的頭來作祭祀，我想是誤傳。（中略）雖然知識不够的人是帶有些野蠻性，但世界到了今天就是任何未開化的民族，我想也不致不盡情理到如是。再說，自從上帝把我降生在夷苗人家，在夷苗區內過活十多年，我從沒有看見如是的舉動，更沒有聽到如是的傳聞，何况端午節是夷苗靑年惟一談愛的一年中僅有的一天，這是異於漢人而較西方的戀愛更優的風俗，因爲它不使靑年人，因愛浪費時間亦不耗費金錢。這是神聖的貞愛的表示。除了年節和端午，靑年男女們都各司其事，都在爲人類盡其所能。年節更是勞苦終年中一個使筋骨肉體休息的時候，那有耐心作殺人事情呢，至於年青的漢人被俘去在夷苗區作雄媳婦更屬無稽可笑。若說是先生自已所見聞，那也許先生年老昏花，神智失常，和二目不明的結果吧！</p>
<p>現在我來告訴先生一些我們夷苗的一般概况吧：</p>
<p>可以說我們夷苗民衆對得起國家的，這怎購呢！紙要一說明了，任何人都曉得。夷苗民族都住居山地，如說湘西，貴州全部西康的寗屬全部廣西全部，廣東北部及順沿往西北西南至海南島，四川西部雲南全境，湖北西南部，福建北部遠在國外的緬北，越北，那裏居住的不是山地嗎？可是交租，納稅是照樣，也許還要比漢人納的多多呢！至於當兵，也不例外。</p>
<p>一片忠誠</p>
<p>雖然如此，然而夷苗民衆從沒有呌過苦，也從沒喊過不平，反過來說，夷苗民衆對國家是都有一片忠誠之心的。我更可以告訴你，在西南的夷苗靑年，現在已有不少是大學畢業，不少的高中畢業，還有許多正在將畢業中；可是從沒有一個想踏進宦途，沒有一個不是回，去幹實地工作的，辦學開墾是他們一向的願望，但是又還有許多呢！從沒見過書，也從不識一字。更有的辛辛苦苦在敎會學校念了個小學，初中，或者高中就輟了學。</p>
<p>幾年來祇聽見西南邊疆上有剿夷的工作而欠缺敎化的試騐。（中略）總之夷苗靑年是在水深火熱中生活，他們有的以半工半讀而取得了小學初中或者高中的程度，然而實際能再深造的却很少，終於又回去握鋤頭，受盡人生的冷暖和卑視，而從朱見過一綫的同情，雖然國父手訂國內各民族一律平等，但平等在你先生的這篇文字雖在後段使我很不滿，而氣奮，但是爲「倮倮」二字先生來作如是的辯正，並呼籲「不要歧視我們」我敢代表夷苗靑年向先生致謝，更向先生和全國的父老保證，祇要國內各民族一律平等，眞正的平等，無論政治，經濟，軍事，以及任何方面。夷苗靑年絕對是國家的好公民，好百姓，不信請先生和全國的父老拭目以待到眞平等到來時看看是如何？專此，謹祝平安。夷苗靑年梨黎阿閏上</p>
<h3>羅斯福如何應付　史達林（1）</h3>
<p>— 法蘭絲·潘金著　葛春樑譯</p>
<p>（按：這是一個和羅斯福同事了三十五年的女人所寫的。她很接近地當着他的政治同僚，州政府公務員和國會議員，在這一章中，她叙述着羅斯福是如何的贏得史太林的心。）</p>
<p>佛蘭克林，羅斯福並不是一個平凡的入。那造成偉大和高貴的一種簡單的德性却不是他所有的，他是我所知道的一切人類中腦子最複雜的一個人，在他複雜的天性中，有着力量使他向着創造偉績的路前進，更有着無窮十盡的同情，使他喜歡了那些各式各樣，種族不同的人們，同時，也被他們所喜歡着，更有着力量使他在看戲或是休息中暫時的忘記一下他的許許多多的問題，更有着力量常常使他在矛盾中掙扎着，那常使那些和他一同工作的人們，那些希望着他有未卜先知和決不動搖的剛强的意志的那些人們，感到非常困惑的，但是，這天性的複雜，使他有了見識和理想來深入那些各式各樣種族不同的人們的生活經騐中，甚至於，在他的後半生，他竟然把那些種族不同的人們的體格上，社交上，地理上，經濟上，以及軍事上的情形，担負起來，當作他自己的責任。</p>
<p>一個最好的榜樣，來述說他的才能，就是他和史太林元帥在德黑蘭會議的時候。那些俄國人使羅斯福感到有趣和好奇，他不能够使那些在屋子中來往的僕役們和他談話，他們服務得很週到，工作得很勤懇，時常高興地，誘人地微笑着，可是却不開口，一句話也不說，他仍舊非常喜歡他們。</p>
<p>他設法準備着去喜歡史太林，同時決心使他自己也被喜歡着，當我想和他談議會中一件特殊的法律議案時，他告訴了我和史太林邂逅的故事，當我在談着法律議案的時候，他的眼睛中若有所思，心彷彿不知道在那裏，他唯唯地說着：『唔！唔！』</p>
<p>後來，驀然地他轉過頭來，那是他常有的動作，說出了他所在想着的話：『你該知道俄國人是很有趣的人民，在起初的三天中，我沒有一絲一毫的進步，我簡直得不到任何和史太林私人交接的機會，雖然他要求我做的事，我甚麽都替他做了，我住在他的大使館中，出席着他的宴會，被介紹給了他的大臣和將軍們。他是一個準確的，强硬的，莊嚴的人，却不常微笑，沒有可以使我抓得住的人心。　（未完）</p>

<h3>奔走和平的孫科　不常開口的政論家</h3>
<p>— 征凡</p>
<p>『胡展堂會客時，只有他說的，沒有你說的；×××會客時，見你說多少，他也說多少；只有孫哲生先生冷冷的對着客人，你不說他也不說。』這是十餘年前記者羣中極流行的論調。孫科先生原是一個沉默寡言的人物，他老是那麽不開；，連得客人們也只得閉起口來。但是，由於多方周旋接觸的緣故，現在的孫先生已是雄辯滔滔的政論家了，雖然他對於一切寒暄客套之類，也許還不十分內行。</p>
<p>孫氏的學生時代，完全受的美國式敎育。童年肄業於夏威夷；民國初元，以政府公費留學美國，進加里福利州立大學，畢業後又入哥倫比亞大學攻政治及經濟學，得碩士學位。在校學業冠羣，爲留美學生會會長，協助國父在海外鼓吹革命甚力。民國六年返國時，對中文還不大熟悉。因此有人說過：『顧孟餘先生不吃中國飯，孫哲生先生不寫中國字。」孫氏在任廣州市畏及鐵道部長的時候，批閱公文，還用鋼筆簽名。後來有位朋友勸他改用毛筆寫字，他模仿國父筆法，開始練習，居然學得非常相似，從此對毛筆字非常感到興趣，時常替人題字，寫對聯，爲人寫墓誌銘。試一比孫氏簽名式的「孫」字，與國父簽名式的「孫」字，就知道是一模一樣的。</p>
<p>記者出身</p>
<p>黨國要人中出身新聞界的指不勝數，如于右任，邵力子，戴季陶，與敬恒，陳布雷等。孫氏也曾做過新聞記者，那是在他剛回國的時候，在廣州時報任主筆，撰論甚多。</p>
<p>孫氏現年五十六歲，比國父夫人宋慶齡女士長三歲。長立法院到現在也已經十多年了，他的政績，無容　述。所著書籍甚多，其文字散見於報章雜誌者亦復不少，特論向極中肯，對中蘇關係硏究允深，一向主張「中蘇友善合作」，他是中蘇文化協會會長。</p>
<p>很像父親</p>
<p>孫氏的性格，好幾處像他的父親，大家知道國父生平的兩大嗜好，是「革命與讀書」，孫氏除了從事革命建設以外，最大的嗜好，便是「讀書」。他的私邸中，有一座幽雅宜人的書房，有吳稚輝先生的補題「不足齋」四字。另有一副對聯，是：「養浩然氣，讀有用書。』關於國際問題，政黨，政治，經濟，社會等書籍，搜藏得非常豐富。除了讀書以外，騎馬，游泳，游覽名勝，收藏書畫碑帖等也是他的附帶嗜好。</p>
<p>前不多時，孫氏曾爲其生母盧太夫人祝壽，盧太夫人今已八十歲，體軀仍極他吒。孫氏性較燥急，但對盧太夫人極能順其意。</p>
<p>在烽火遍地的今日，孫氏是最竭力鼓吹和平的一人。最近，留滬第三方面各領袖，邀孫氏出而斡旋大局，孫氏已懇　允諾。願孫氏出其全力，爲和平作最大的努力！</p>

<h3>Marshall and Stuart Leighton Jointly Visit Chairman Chiang, Seeking to Open the Door to Peace; The U.S. is Watching the Development of Marshall's Mediation</h3>
<p>[United Press Agency, Nanjing, 13th] U.S. Special Envoy to China General Marshall and U.S. Ambassador to China Stuart Leighton jointly visited Chairman Chiang at 5:00 PM on the 13th to make a final effort for the dying peace talks. This meeting is extremely important, but the outcome is currently unknown. Before visiting Chairman Chiang, Marshall and Stuart Leighton held talks for two hours this morning. Well-informed sources here believe that although mediators continue to work hard, all hope for resolving the KMT-CPC issue has effectively disappeared. Meanwhile, Communist Party representatives Dong Biwu and Wang Bingnan stayed at home all day today. According to Communist Party sources, the official response from the Communist Party is being drafted in Shanghai by Zhou Enlai based on instructions from Yan'an and is expected to be delivered to Nanjing in the next day or two.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 13th] Special Envoy Marshall went to the embassy to meet with Ambassador Stuart at 10:00 AM on the 13th, leaving around 12:00 PM. The ambassador visited Special Envoy Marshall again at 8:00 PM in the afternoon. It is reported that the two mediators are still willing to make the greatest effort to facilitate a turnaround in the precarious situation that is about to collapse. They firmly believe that the KMT-CPC dispute, although seemingly military, is actually political. Therefore, the war should not affect political negotiations. It is heard that the two will still seek a way to resolve the military issue through political means. However, Marshall and Stuart Leighton may remain silent for a day or two and not express any opinions for the time being.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Nanjing, 13th] A certain newspaper reported that Marshall and Stuart Leighton are expected to issue a third joint statement soon.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 12th] The White House and the U.S. State Department are closely monitoring developments related to Marshal Marshall's mission.</p>
<p>Political Consultative Conference Representatives Discuss National Assembly List with Sun Ke</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 13th] After the Communist Party issued a stubborn statement on the 13th, people in the capital, observing the current situation, pinned their hopes on President Sun Ke's return to Nanjing. Sun arrived in Nanjing at 4:00 PM in the afternoon. After resting for less than half an hour, Political Consultative Conference representatives Wu Dingchang, Chen Lifu, Wu Tiecheng, Zhang Lisheng, Wang Shijie, Shao Lizi, Chen Bulei, Lei Zhen, etc., went to Sun's residence to discuss the issue of various parties participating in the National Assembly. Sun reported on his contacts with various parties in Shanghai, and expressed the hope that they would come to Nanjing. It is reported that those present exchanged opinions for a long time and agreed that the government would leave the greatest leeway in procedures and formalities for the proposal of the National Assembly list by various parties and would further study the suggestions made by the Democratic League. It is said that a new decision has been reached and was submitted to the Chairman in the evening. Also, Li Huang of the Youth Party flew to Shanghai by plane at 12:00 AM. Liang Shuming of the Democratic League visited Li this morning for a meeting. Liang told reporters that he did not want to say much, only that everything would be studied and decided by the representatives staying in Shanghai. In other news, although people from the Democratic League in Shanghai have temporarily suspended their trip to Nanjing due to the changing situation, it is said that their overall attitude is also inconsistent. Some cautious people are quietly observing the changes, and there may be new expressions in the coming days.</p>
<h3>The National Assembly Will Proceed as Scheduled Even if Various Parties Do Not Participate</h3>
<p>[French News Agency, Nanjing, 12th] Although the CPC and the Democratic League denounced the government's order to convene the National Assembly as scheduled, saying that it intended to shatter all hopes for a peaceful resolution of the KMT-CPC issue, the government is actively preparing, arranging the venue, and receiving the National Assembly representatives, with all employees working day and night. According to the National Assembly spokesperson's conversation with our agency's reporter, regarding the number of representatives, the total number of representatives is 2,050, of which 1,560 have already been elected or appointed. The government still needs to designate 74 people as representatives. Even if the various parties do not participate, the National Assembly will still proceed as scheduled. Generally speaking, the Youth Party and representatives from various parties will attend, even if the CPC and the Democratic League do not.</p>
<h3>Communist Party Delegation May Withdraw to Yan'an</h3>
<p>The Youth Party Continues to Promote Peace</p>
<p>[United Press Agency, Nanjing, 13th] A certain official of the Central Executive Committee in Yan'an stated firmly today that the peace talks in China have finally broken down. And a certain person from the Communist Party here hinted that the Communist Party delegation may soon announce its withdrawal from the negotiations and return to Yan'an. When asked if the Communist Party delegation would withdraw to Yan'an, the person said: "Since we have nothing to do in Nanjing, we will certainly not stay here." When asked when the Communist Party delegation might withdraw, they said that they had not yet received such orders from Yan'an.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City] Yesterday afternoon, a reporter visited Chen Qitian, Secretary-General of the Central Party Headquarters of the Chinese Youth Party on Huashan Road, and asked for his opinion on the future of peace in China. He replied as follows: The future of peace in China has not yet reached a state of complete despair. As long as everyone continues to work hard, it will not be difficult to promote peace. Now is a critical time. I hope that all parties will quickly engage in consultations to save the crisis of peace. The Youth Party's desire for peace has never dared to lag behind others, and it will follow the people of the country and continue to work hard to promote peace.</p>

<h3>Chairman's National Day Speech Published by Soviet Newspapers</h3>
<p>Moscow Radio Also Broadcasts It</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Moscow, 13th] Local newspapers today published a TASS dispatch from Nanjing on October 10 regarding Chairman Chiang's Double Tenth broadcast speech. Moscow Radio also broadcast the news this morning.</p>
<h3>The Northern Section of the Pinghan Railway: The Focus of the War is on Both Ends</h3>
<p>The Outskirts of Shijiazhuang Suddenly Tense</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 13th] The war situation in the northern section of the Pinghan Railway is about to change. The National Army has transferred the remaining forces to drive away the Communist Army, which has been showing off for half a month.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Baoding, 13th] The outskirts of Shijiazhuang are suddenly tense. The Communist Army is massively concentrating forces along the Tuotuo River and northwest of Shijiazhuang. The outside of Baoding City is calm, and a Pacification Promotion Association has been established in the city. The northern section of the Pinghan Railway is focusing on both ends, carrying out a mopping-up operation against the main force of the Communist Army. Part of the National Army has arrived in Laibing and Yixian City.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Tianjin, 13th] The National Army's reinforcements in the northern section of the Pinghan Railway are engaged in fierce fighting with the Communist Army near Dingxing. The war in the southern section is also between Dingxian and Haifengdian.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Baoding, 13th] The main force of the 120th Division of He Long's Communist Army is currently active in the Dawangzicheng area north of Baoding.

<h3>The Threat to the Siping-Meihekou Line Has Been Eliminated</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Changchun, 12th] The threat to the Siping-Meihekou road has been eliminated, and a trial run was conducted on the Double Tenth Festival. The entire line from Siping to Meihekou is in good condition.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Changchun, 12th] There may not be any military actions north of Changchun this year. A certain military observer told reporters: The National Army is currently in a state of peace in northern Northeast China, but if the Communist Army does carry out harassment actions, the National Army has the strength to give it a serious blow. As for the issue of repairing the Songjiang Weiqiao bridge, the Communist side strongly disagrees, believing that the repair of the bridge poses a fatal threat to the Communist Army's strongholds north of Songhua. In fact, this view is purely a psychological disturbance of the Communist Army's own insecurity.</p>
<h3>Liu Handong Speaks</h3>
<p>Deeply Hoping That the Communist Army Will Stop Harassment to Prevent the People from Suffering War Again</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 11th] Siping Telephone, Liaobei Province Chairman Liu Handong, specifically issued a statement regarding the Communist Army of Liaobei launching an offensive, illegally occupying Xifeng, and attacking Dongfeng and Xi'an events, saying that he has been ordered by the Central Government to preside over the provincial government and has a responsibility to defend the territory. He deeply hopes that the Communist Army can realize its mistakes in time and stop its harassment attempts to prevent the people of Northeast China from suffering war again after the disaster. Otherwise, he will, as his duty dictates, supervise his subordinates, defend the territory, and protect the people, and the Communist Army will be responsible for all consequences arising therefrom.</p>
<h3>Huailai and Xuanhua Have Been Recaptured; The National Armies of Sun and Fu Will Soon Join Forces; Yan'an Formally Admits to Withdrawing from Zhangjiakou</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 13th] The Huailai front, which had been fought fiercely for more than ten days, was finally completely defeated by the National Army at 2:00 AM on the 13th. The remnants of the Communist Army retreated to Yuxian in more than 200 cars. Huailai was officially recaptured. The National Army passing through the front of Huailai has now connected with the troops that bypassed Huailai earlier and recaptured Xiahuayuan. There is currently no frontal resistance from the Communist Army from the eastern section of the PingSui Railway to Xiahuayuan. The National Army in that area can join forces with Fu Zuoyi's troops, who recaptured Xuanhua yesterday afternoon, and connect the PingSui line east of Zhangjiakou. As for the war in Chahar Province, except for the unknown details of the Chaigoubao area, the Communist Army has almost completely lost its will to fight. According to reports, the battle of Huailai was extremely fierce, and both armies suffered heavy losses. The Communist Army dug ditches several feet wide and deep to prevent tanks, and the air defense works were also very strong. The Communist Army placed a large number of mines in important retreat locations. Therefore, the military specially trained mine-sweeping teams to assist the transportation authorities in repairing the railway.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 13th] After the National Army recaptured Zhangjiakou, it continued to divide its troops into two routes. One route went east and entered Xuanhua at 5:30 PM on the 12th. This unit can join forces with the 11th War Zone Commander Sun Lianzhong's troops, who recaptured Xiahuayuan, in Xinzhuangzi between them within days. The troops advancing westward have reached Chaigoubao. The remnants of the Communist Army in Chahar Province have lost their will to fight.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 13th] Reliable news, after the National Army Fu Zuoyi's troops recaptured Zhangjiakou, one side deployed city defenses and reorganized the city. The other side quickly went south. The city of Xuanhua was recaptured by Sun Bingfeng's troops at 5:00 PM on the evening of the 12th and will soon join forces with the 11th War Zone troops, who broke through the Communist Army's defense line in Huailai after a bloody battle, in Xiahuayuan according to the original plan.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 13th] Mei Yi, a spokesperson for the CPC delegation, officially stated at noon on the 13th that the Communist Army voluntarily withdrew from Zhangjiakou on the afternoon of the 11th. The National Army attacking Zhangjiakou was Fu Zuoyi's troops who went south from Zhangbei. The war is currently taking place in the Xuanhua-Huailai area. Yan'an announced on the 12th that the Eighth Route Army withdrew from Zhangjiakou on the 11th.</p>
<h3>Chairman Chiang Allocates Funds to Reward the Troops; Chief of Staff Chen Cheng Meets with Fu, Li, etc. to Discuss</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Gui Sui, 13th] Chairman Chiang allocated 500 million yuan to reward the National Army that recaptured Zhangjiakou.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 13th] After hearing the good news early in the morning of the 13th that the Communist Army on the Huailai front was completely defeated, Chief of Staff Chen went to the Beiping Pacification Headquarters in the morning to meet with Li Zongren and others.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 12th] Chief of Staff Chen Cheng flew back to Gui Sui on the 12th, comforted Commander Fu, and returned to Beiping at 6:00 PM that evening.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Gui Sui, 12th] Chen Cheng flew to Zhangjiakou to inspect the area above on the morning of the 12th and arrived in Sui at 12:00 PM to discuss with Commander Fu. He commented on this matter as follows: The evacuation of Zhangjiakou is of course a loss to the people, but from a realistic military point of view, it has not caused difficulties for the people. The key to deciding the current Chinese civil war is not the temporary gains and losses of a few cities, but the ebb and flow of military strength between the two sides. When we started the ten-year civil war, we did not have a single city, and at the beginning of the eight-year war of resistance, there was not a single county town in the secret border area of Shaanxi and Gansu, and we could still annihilate the enemy's forces and achieve victory; then today, in the liberated area with 400 million people, what's wrong with temporarily withdrawing from some cities and towns in exchange for the conditions to annihilate the enemy's forces? In the future, the people of the liberated areas will be relieved of their illusions about peace and the burden of defending the city of Zhangjiakou. Afterwards, their military strength will become stronger and stronger, and their use of troops will become more mobile. The Kuomintang's difficulties will increase, its weaknesses will become greater, its front lines will become longer, and its supplies will be more difficult to maintain. Although it can still occupy some cities, the military and civilians of the liberated areas will be more united and launch resistance. When its power is annihilated to a certain extent, it will definitely be able to completely crush its offensive and recover Zhangjiakou, Chengde, Jining, Huaiyin, and all lost territories.</p>
<h3>Zhangbei Airport Repaired</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Gui Sui, 13th] The Zhangbei Airport has been repaired. A test takeoff and landing was successfully conducted on the 13th.</p>

<h3>The Commander of the Beiping Garrison Changes</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 13th] Chen Jicheng, Deputy Commander of the 11th War Zone, succeeded Hou Lingru, Commander of the 92nd Army, as Commander of the Beiping Garrison.</p>
<h3>Chinese and Foreign Journalists in Beiping Contacted to Visit Zhangjiakou</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 13th] In order to inspect Zhangjiakou after the war, Chinese and foreign journalists here have asked the Beiping Pacification Headquarters to negotiate for transportation. Director Li Zongren urgently telegraphed Commander Fu Zuoyi on the 13th to inquire whether the Zhangjiakou airport could be quickly repaired.</p>
<h3>Feng Qinzai Will Go to Huailai to Preside Over the Demobilization Affairs of Chahar Province; Gu Zhenggang Will Enter Chahar to Handle Emergency Relief</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 13th] Chahar Chairman Feng Qinzai is scheduled to leave Beiping for Huailai on the morning of the 14th to preside over the demobilization of Chahar Province.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 13th] Chahar Chairman Feng Qinzai has ordered the Provincial Security Corps stationed in other places to return to the province immediately to cooperate with the National Army in pacifying the local area, and ordered the underground security corps lurking in various counties in the province to rise up and restore the county towns. It is said that Huai'an was recovered by these security corps.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 13th] The war in Chahar Province is about to end, and post-war reconstruction will follow. Although the Chahar Provincial Government has sent personnel to follow the army, it remains to be seriously considered whether it can immediately launch effective post-war reconstruction work without repeating the precedents of other recovered areas in an environment of lack of both personnel and funds. Provincial Chairman Feng Qinzai told reporters yesterday that he had repeatedly telegraphed Commander Fu Zuoyi to inquire about the current situation in Chahar Province. The Central Government has approved the allocation of 500 million yuan by the United Relief Association, which Minister Gu Zhenggang will personally bring to Chahar to handle emergency relief. However, after thorough destruction, the amount of 500 million yuan seems unable to achieve much effect. Another famous Chahar person who fled to Beiping said: He is worried about the local order after the passage of the troops. For example, in some counties in eastern Hebei, after the large army recovered the strongholds, it was handed over to ineffective local teams to maintain security. Not only could they not control the situation, but they might even lose what they had regained. When the armed people could withdraw, the common people would suffer. Therefore, he will consider the issue of returning home. Conversely, the revenge tendencies of the armed return teams must also be anticipated, and textbooks are still not prepared.</p>

<h3>Former Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Army in China, India, and Burma, General Stilwell, Dies of Illness; Chairman Chiang Sends a Special Telegram to Mrs. Stilwell to Express Condolences</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, San Francisco, 12th, United Press Agency] Former Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Army in the China-Burma-India Theater, General Stilwell (Gangjian), has died of liver disease in a hospital here at the age of 63. He was currently the commander of the Sixth Army. He was admitted to the hospital on September 28 to check his liver. Five days later, army doctors performed surgery. The condition was better, but it suddenly deteriorated on the 9th of this month, his physical strength weakened day by day, and he finally died at 3:48 PM on the 12th.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 13th] Chairman Chiang sent a special telegram to express condolences upon learning of General Stilwell's death in the United States. The original text is as follows: "To Mrs. Stilwell, I am deeply saddened to hear of the death of General Stilwell. I also understand that the General's illness was caused by leading Chinese and other allied forces side by side in India and Burma. The General's death is not only mourned by my wife and I, but is also a loss to the entire Chinese people. Chiang Kai-shek."</p>
<h3>Mourning Stilwell</h3>
<p>— Our Newspaper Editorial Department</p>
<p>No Regrets in Death</p>
<p>"If I can prove that Chinese soldiers are as good as soldiers from any allied country, I will have no regrets in death."</p>
<p>This is what General Stilwell said to reporters when he began training Chinese troops in India. Now that General Stilwell has died of illness in the United States, and the bad news has spread, the military and civilians of our country will inevitably mourn the death of this great general who made great contributions. But General Shi has no regrets, because Chinese soldiers have been proven to be as brave and good at fighting as any soldiers in the world.</p>
<p>Stilwell arrived in China on March 3, 1942, and was responsible for planning and commanding the Burma campaign. He had served in China for twenty years of his life. He was familiar with Chinese, Japanese, and also familiar with the capabilities and needs of the Chinese troops. In two years and eight months, the Burma campaign turned from defense to offense, which is the main part of his achievement.</p>
<p>Translated and compiled by our newspaper</p>
<p>Stilwell is every soldier's uncle and old man, he is the father of his army. When he passed by the battlefield hospital, he always stopped to greet the wounded soldiers in Chinese. He often lived with American and Chinese soldiers, ate their pickled vegetables, and chatted casually. He suddenly appeared everywhere in the jungle.</p>
<p>In the spring of 1942, the Japanese army succeeded in Burma, and the Allied forces were driven out. General Stilwell was determined to avenge his humiliation at this time. He served as the commander of the U.S. Army in the China-India-Burma theater. At that time, he had a plan to open a new supply route to China. At the same time, he wanted to establish some training centers in India, where American personnel would train a new modern Chinese army.</p>
<p>The Plan is Realized</p>
<p>His plan began to be realized in October 1942. Many British and American officers thought this was impossible. They pointed out that Stilwell's actions were just a political performance to increase the morale of the Chinese army; but facts proved that Stilwell was not a politician, he was a very practical person.</p>
<p>When the India training center was first established, it used the Chinese troops who had retreated from Burma under the command of Generals Sun Liren and Liao Yaoxiang as the core, and later gradually expanded. A year later, a division of Chinese troops trained by the United States, carrying the latest American weapons, left the training center in India and went to the front line. One and a half years after the fall of Burma, the offensive of the Chinese army began. This was the first real offensive action by China in its six years of war against Japan.</p>
<p>General Stilwell often went to the front line in person. This great spirit of selflessness has won the respect and respect of Chinese soldiers for him. Under his leadership, two divisions of Chinese troops occupied more than 1,000 square miles of territory occupied by the Japanese Kou, killing more than 7,000 Japanese Kou, and penetrating into the Japanese-occupied areas. This is something that no Allied force in the Asian continent has been able to do since the outbreak of the Far East War.</p>
<p>Heroic Story</p>
<p>To describe Stilwell's achievements and personality, we should trace back to a story about him in Burma.</p>
<p>During the battle of Hukang, Stilwell once discovered that a battalion of Chinese troops was lost and searching for a way in the mountains and jungles west of the Hukang Valley.</p>
<p>They ran into the Japanese army's crisscrossing trail network and occupied a small clearing, believing that this clearing was their target. Stilwell, along with a distressed Chinese division commander, two American liaison officers, and a few guards, went to find this lost battalion of people. He also carried his famous "little axe." The solemn look in his eyes indicated that he was going to use his "little axe."</p>
<p>Using a compass, he led his anxious group across the mountains along jungle trails that had been trampled out or cut by the Kachin people. The Chinese troops who had passed through this area a few days ago were only a few hundred yards away from a company of Japanese troops, and they didn't even know that there were Japanese troops there. But Japanese snipers and ambushers did not discover this old man (referring to Stilwell) disturbing them. He was very anxious. Late in the evening, they found the lost battalion of people. Stilwell, with the consent of the division commander, replaced the battalion commander to let them rest, and pointed out to the new battalion commander how to reach his target. Then Stilwell went to sleep in a bomb shelter. The next morning, this battalion of Chinese troops moved in the right direction, and Stilwell returned to the division headquarters.</p>
<p>Life Deeds</p>
<p>Stilwell graduated from West Point Military Academy in 1904 and served in the U.S. garrison in the Philippines; from 1917 to 1918, he participated in the European War; in 1920, 23 he studied at the North China Language School in Beiping; from 1926 to 1929, he served in the 15th Infantry Division of the U.S. Army stationed in Tianjin; from 1929 to 1933, he served as the Chief of Staff of the U.S. Army in China; from 1942 to 1944, he served as the Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Army in the China-India-Burma Theater and also served as the Chief of Staff of the Chairman.</p>
<p>Stilwell has received countless medals, the most important of which are the Distinguished Service Cross and the Medal of Merit, but his favorite to receive was the Combat Infantry Badge. In order to fulfill his wish, U.S. Secretary of the Army Patterson presented him with this medal 24 hours before his death.</p>
<p>General Stilwell died at the age of 63. At the time of his death, his position was the commander of the U.S. Sixth Army.</p>

<h3>National Army in Northern Jiangsu Recovers Linze; Advances Rapidly Towards Xinghua, Dongtai, and Lianshui; Communist Army in Southern Shandong Cornered, Major Battle Imminent</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Zhenjiang, Thirteenth] The National Army at Jieshou recovered Linze at 7:00 AM yesterday, and is victoriously advancing towards Xinghua.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, Thirteenth] Military News: The Communist forces in Xinghua and Dongtai are on the verge of collapse and will soon retreat. The National Army has separately pressed close to the outskirts.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Taixian, Thirteenth] Confirmed information states that Xinghua can be recovered within ten days. The local Home Return Corps is actively preparing to enter the city. The war situation in Dongtai is brewing. It is reported that the recovery of Dongtai will be earlier than that of Xinghua. The Home Return Corps is scheduled to advance eastward from Taixian on the 14th.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Taixian, Thirteenth] Near Fanchuan and Xiaoji, the Communist army launched a sneak attack on our military supply line, which was repelled by the National Army, and the Communist forces have been routed.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Taixian, Thirteenth] The Communist government of the Jiangsu-Anhui border region, in light of the changing situation in northern Jiangsu, has specially designated the five counties under the jurisdiction of the First Administrative Region—Rugao, Nantong, Qidong, Haimen, and Chongming—as the Ninth Commissioner's Office, appointing Liang Lingguang as the commissioner. The First Administrative Commissioner has been replaced by Zhu Hai'ao, who also serves as the Director of Education. The deputy commissioner is Dong Shangbai, former county magistrate of Dongtai, who also serves as the Director of Civil Affairs. Ji Kai serves as the Director of Construction, and Liu Hegeng serves as the Director of Finance and Food.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Taixian, Thirteenth] After the reorganization of the Communist administration in the northern Chuzi region, the county magistrates of various counties have been reassigned as follows: Lu San, county magistrate of Rugao; Liu Hao, county magistrate of Jingjiang, and Xue Guangle, deputy county magistrate; Wu Ming, county magistrate of Taixian, and Zuo Kaiyun, deputy county magistrate; Zhu Jianming, county magistrate of Chaishi; He Huan, county magistrate of Dongtai, and Lu Wenbin, deputy county magistrate.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Xuzhou, Thirteenth] Chief of Staff Li of the Xuzhou Pacification Command stated: For the past two months, the Communist forces in Jiangsu and Shandong have gathered more than 25 divisions of troops to launch a planned general offensive. The National Army was forced to counterattack, and the Communist forces suffered repeated defeats, which proves that the Communist forces can only fight sneakily; they are not worth a blow in a fair battle. Currently, the main force of the Communist forces in northern Jiangsu, the New Fourth Army's Third Division, Fourth Division, and Seventh Column, consists of no more than 70,000 men. They have been routed and are retreating to southern Shandong. Xinghua, Dongtai, and Lianshui will be recovered imminently. If progress is smooth, northern Jiangsu can be cleared by the end of the month. Liu Bocheng's unit in western Shandong, with one division and seven columns of over 50,000 men, is on the border between Juye and Jiaxiang. Six of its columns have been defeated, and morale is shaken. The National Army can move into Juye and Jiaxiang at any time. However, the Communist forces in the two regions of Shandong will inevitably fight desperately as trapped beasts, and a major battle will occur.</p>
<h3>Relief Work in Communist-Controlled Areas; Difficult Problems Resolved; 1,500 Tons of Supplies to be Shipped Tomorrow</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City] The second batch of relief supplies from the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) to the Communist-controlled areas of Shandong Province, totaling 1,500 tons, will be shipped to Yantai tomorrow (the 15th) by the Wanheng vessel and then transported to Shiguan (southern Shandong) for distribution to various disaster areas. In the past, there have been various difficulties in transporting UNRRA relief supplies to Communist-controlled areas, but thanks to the continuous efforts of General Wang Shiliang, director of the UNRRA office in Yantai, in the past two months, and his detailed explanations and consultations with relevant authorities, all major problems have been resolved. UNRRA's work in the Beihai region (Shandong Province and southern Hebei) is expected to proceed smoothly.</p>
<p>An Interview with Wang Shiliang</p>
<p>This reporter interviewed Mr. Wang, who is about to go to Shandong, yesterday. He said: Recently, he has met several times in Shanghai with officials from the UNRRA administration and Zhou Enlai, the representative of the Chinese Communists. He will go north on the Wanheng vessel tomorrow to discuss other unresolved details with the local Communist representatives, and also expand the scope of work of the Yantai office. He will return to Shanghai in two weeks to report on the progress of all work. General Wang also solemnly declared that there are two principles for his work in Yantai: (1) As the director of the Yantai office, he is only an executor of the office's work and does not wish to have any opinions of his own. He only wishes to implement UNRRA's resolutions and policies and execute UNRRA's relief work, accepting all instructions from UNRRA. He will distribute as many relief supplies as UNRRA provides, with a completely impartial spirit, to serve the people. (2) The distribution of UNRRA relief supplies is not disorderly. All relief supplies must be distributed by UNRRA and UNRRA personnel, and they must personally see the relief supplies delivered to the people. In other words, relief supplies will not be transported to areas where UNRRA and UNRRA personnel cannot reach, so as to ensure that the supplies can truly relieve those who need relief. Mr. Wang stated that since he took on the task of relief work, he has been carrying out his duties based on these two major principles. The 1,500 tons of supplies being transported to the Yantai office this time include food, flour, medicine, hospital equipment, and clothing. For the sake of benefiting the people, supplies will continue to be transported to the area in the future. When asked what working problems had been resolved recently with Mr. Zhou Enlai, Mr. Wang replied: (1) The communication problem of the office—to solve the communication difficulties, the Yantai office will set up two radio stations to communicate with the outside world, one in Yantai and one in Linyi. (2) The currency system—the currency used in the Communist-controlled area is the Beihai currency. In the future, the exchange rate will be 1 to 15 (i.e., 15 national currency equals 1 Beihai currency), and the accommodation, food, and furniture for UNRRA staff will be provided locally. (3) Freedom of movement—previously, all strict military areas were prohibited areas. Now, Zhou Enlai has sent a letter to the local authorities, stating that, except for special military areas, UNRRA personnel should be allowed to move freely in other areas. The above three issues have been agreed upon recently. The issue of inland transportation costs is quite serious, because the labor costs for dockworkers and the transportation costs from Yantai to other areas are very high. The UNRRA is willing to bear two-thirds of the costs and requests the Communists to be responsible for one-third. This method can be tried. The Communist Party is considering the proposal. Accompanying Mr. Wang are more than 20 UNRRA staff members, some of whom...</p>

<h3>We Treat Female Guests with State Guest Etiquette; Mrs. Cripps is the First; Foreign Minister Wang Hosts Banquet and Delivers Welcoming Speech Last Night</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, Thirteenth] Minister of Foreign Affairs Wang Shijie hosted a banquet for Mrs. Cripps on the evening of the 13th. In his speech, he said: "Two and a half years ago, when I and the members of the Chinese delegation to Britain visited Britain, the British United Aid to China Fund warmly received us. Mrs. Cripps delivered a welcoming speech during the banquet. After the speech, Sir Cripps told me that this was Mrs. Cripps' first public speech. I therefore know that Mrs. Cripps is not a person who likes to talk much. She would rather do practical work than be a speaker. Thinking about this, I feel that my welcoming speech tonight, even if it is a little short, does not need to be particularly apologized to Mrs. Cripps. The first thing I want to say is that our country treats female guests with state guest etiquette, and this is the first time. My wife and I are honored to be able to host this banquet tonight. Another noteworthy point is that the huge amount of money donated by the United Aid to China Fund led by Mrs. Cripps has deeply impressed us, but I believe that it is even more valuable that the United Aid to China Fund has enabled the British people to deeply understand the value of China during and after the war. The United Aid to China Fund, led by Mrs. Cripps, has intimately introduced wartime China and the Chinese people to the British people through countless lectures, exhibitions, and publications organized by its numerous branches. This contribution is very important. Finally, I would like to assure Mrs. Cripps and all those who have come with her that your Chinese friends will definitely cooperate with you to the best of their ability to promote Sino-British friendship and understanding. Please join me in raising a glass to wish Mrs. Cripps and all those who have come with her greater success."</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, Thirteenth] Mrs. Cripps is scheduled to leave Beijing by air for Chongqing at 9:30 AM on the 14th.

She is scheduled to return to Beijing on November 16, and then go to Guangzhou and Hong Kong before flying back to England. It is reported that Mrs. Cripps may make a trip to Shenyang when she arrives in Beiping. Yu Chaoying and Li Zijian Inspect Overseas Chinese in Various Parts of Nanyang.</p>

<h3>Septuagenarian Yuan Xiluo Offers Loyal Advice to the Communists Again; Sends a Telegram to Communist Leaders Through This Newspaper</h3>
<p>Yuan Xiluo, the elder who previously appealed for an end to the civil war by "risking his old life" and "going on a hunger strike," wrote his final telegram to the leaders of the Chinese Communist Party on National Day and entrusted this newspaper to publish it as a final appeal. Excerpts are as follows:</p>
<p>To the Shanghai Shenbao, transfer to Mr. Zhou Enlai, representative of the Chinese Communist Party, and to Mr. Mao Zedong in Yan'an, Generals Zhu De and other communist military leaders, political workers, and party members: Now that it is the Double Ten Festival, I would like to offer you a word. It has been a year since the Japanese invaders surrendered. During this year, if your party and the National Government could put the country first and the lives of the people first, and not engage in military struggles for territory, and work together to form a government of the people of the whole country, and focus on construction and reconstruction, how much could the national interest and the welfare of the people have been increased during this year? But it could not be done! I, Yuan Xiluo, have no choice but to shout loudly again to alert your party. I recall that in January of this year, I wrote two papers on the Datong chapter of the Book of Rites and entrusted my old friend Huang Yanpei to give them to Mr. Zhou Enlai and send them to Mr. Mao and Mr. Zhu, asking them to read them. This Datong chapter is truly a golden rule for saving the human world. It can not only save China from the current internal strife, but also permanently end wars in the world. The so-called Great Way is the way of the world belonging to all. The world belongs to all of humanity. It is definitely not the world of a single family or a single surname in the era of emperors, nor is it the world of a single party or a single leader in the era of democracy. Therefore, the one-party dictatorship, such as the current Soviet communist government's one-party dictatorship, has not truly understood the essence of the world belonging to all. The Chinese Kuomintang has now decided to return power to the people and cannot be criticized further. We should constantly urge it to realize this. The Chinese Communist Party should understand the essence of the world belonging to all and not learn from the Soviet Union's one-party dictatorship. The so-called "selecting the virtuous and capable, emphasizing credibility and cultivating harmony" is truly the key to governing the country. The reason why China is ungoverned today is that the virtuous and capable have not been appointed. Therefore, the use of people must prioritize virtue and ability and not party affiliation, and people should not compete for positions with each other. As for the civil war between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, which has lasted for more than a decade, it is all due to the failure to emphasize credibility and cultivate harmony. War is like fire, and if it is not suppressed, it will burn itself. Where are Hitler, Mussolini, and Tojo Hideki, the war criminals who were notorious for warmongering? They can serve as a warning. It is regrettable that the Kuomintang and the Communist Party appeared to be united but were divided in spirit during the eight years of bitter war. The fruits of the eight-year War of Resistance were actually due to the victory of the United States. Now, more than a year has passed since the Japanese surrendered, and there have been more than a year of conflicts between the Kuomintang and the Communists. There are several things that our people are dissatisfied with the Communist Party: (1) It specializes in destroying railways, disrupting the national transportation lifeline, preventing the exchange of materials, and causing people to go hungry and cold. (2) When the Communist army clashes with the National Army and retreats due to inferior strength, it destroys the embankments of various rivers, causing floods to inundate the people's homes and fields, leaving hundreds of thousands of families and millions of people without food or shelter, in order to protect its party's military force. This is extremely inhumane. (3) Equalization of land ownership is one of Mr. Sun Yat-sen's principles and must be implemented by the government after consultation and proper measures. The Communist Party acts rashly and arbitrarily distributes land, using communist methods to make landowners, owner-farmers, and tenant farmers suffer, while idlers benefit. (4) It encourages class struggle and purges, disrupting social order and making it impossible for good people to live in peace. (5) It forces people to express their frankness, infringing on freedom of thought, and its methods are even worse than Qin Shi Huang's "even word abandoned on the market." How can this be allowed? I, Yuan Xiluo, deeply love Mr. Mao and Mr. Zhu as outstanding figures in China and cannot bear to see them fail due to the indiscriminate use of ideologies and methods. I offer loyal advice again. Mr. Mao and Mr. Zhu should know the history of Mr. Hong Xiuquan. Hong Xiuquan started an uprising in Jintian, vowing to expel the Manchus and restore the Han Chinese world, but was defeated by Zeng, Zuo, and Li, thus extending the Qing dynasty's lifespan by seventy years. I have great respect for Mr. Hong and condemn Zeng, Zuo, and Li for forgetting their ethnicity. Then I studied the reasons for Mr. Hong's failure. He disregarded the etiquette of the Chinese sages and wise men and set fire to all Confucian temples, Buddhist temples, and Taoist temples when he organized the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom. Zeng, Zuo, and Li were all Confucian scholars and therefore rose up in opposition, turning this war into a holy war of Chinese etiquette. And Mr. Hong's revolution, the grand plan to restore the Han Chinese territory, disappeared after seventeen years. This is very regrettable. Now, I am worried that you will face a similar danger. You use the name of Chinese communism to indicate that you are different from the Soviets, but communism actually originated with Marx and was implemented in Soviet Russia by Lenin. Marx's theory cannot be as perfect as the Great Harmony described by our Confucius, so why must we learn from Marx and forget Confucius? If you do not wake up and continue to seize territory by force and do not cooperate with the people of the country, the result will inevitably be Outer Mongolia II, which is an inevitable result. Mr. Zhou Enlai criticized the United States' China policy, saying that the United States is helping the Kuomintang. I believe that the conflict between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party has troubled Special Envoy Marshall to mediate, and the mediation has failed, and then we have to trouble Ambassador Stuart to mediate. It is embarrassing for these foreign elders over seventy years old to be running around on airplanes and in cars for the sake of the disharmony of Chinese brothers. It is a disgrace to the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, and a disgrace to all the people of China. I am also over seventy years old and would like to have an airplane and car to run around and prevent the internal war in China. First of all, I would like to warn the gentlemen of the Chinese Communist Party: Forty years ago, I joined the Tongmenghui organized by Mr. Sun Yat-sen. Between Xinhai and Renzi, I served as the representative of Jiangsu Province in organizing the Provisional Government of the Republic of China, acting as a provisional senator. When Mr. Sun Yat-sen took office as the President, I held the seal of the President, representing the people of the Republic of China, and presented it to Mr. Sun Yat-sen. After that, I retired to the field of education and educated the citizens of the Republic of China. I am not a member of the Kuomintang at all levels, nor am I appointed as the head or member of a department or committee of the Kuomintang as a party member, but I deeply understand the Buddhist Vehicle, possess a great fearless spirit, and have the perseverance to cut flesh to feed a tiger. I regard the hunger of my Chinese compatriots as my own hunger and the drowning of my compatriots as my own drowning. If there is anyone who starts a war and harms the people, whether they are from the Kuomintang or the Communist Party, I will oppose them. Before the National Government is completely reformed, I respectfully offer the following measures: (1) Please Mr. Mao Zedong go to Nanjing immediately and join hands with President Chiang Kai-shek. At the same time, invite the representatives of the seventeen provinces who organized the Republic of China in the year of Xinhai (excluding those who were in Zhao Ming's puppet government) to Beijing to participate in the meeting. Then, the National Government should invite ten elders from the non-partisan parties to Beijing to participate in the meeting. The Chinese Communist Party and the China Democratic League may each propose one person. Special Envoy Marshall and Ambassador Stuart are invited to serve as advisors to this meeting. This meeting will resolve national affairs. Immediately, please President Chiang Kai-shek order a ceasefire and stop attacking Zhangjiakou. Mr. Mao Zedong should order the Communist army to withdraw to 30 li outside Zhangjiakou, and the Communist army in northern Jiangsu should withdraw to 60 li in the area bordering Jiangsu and Shandong, in order to avoid conflicts. Yuan Xiluo, citizen of the Republic of China. Good, telegram.</p>
<p>"Dutch East Indies" is a political division, not a purely geographic name. It is in...</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Comforting Overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies</h3>
<p>"Dutch East Indies" is a political region, not a purely geographical name. Geographically, it's part of the East Indies archipelago. After the Dutch first entered Java in 1596, they gradually expanded, and in 1609, after breaking away from Spain and becoming a republic, they established Batavia as their political center. In 1602, the Dutch East India Company was established, laying the foundation for the Dutch East Indies empire. From then on, the Dutch succeeded, and the overseas Chinese failed! Reports say that Special Envoy Li Dijun, dispatched by our country to Java, just arrived in Singapore on the 11th, and will go to the Dutch East Indies soon. Today, Special Envoy Li's comforting of overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies is the most obvious proof of the failure of overseas Chinese.</p>
<p>The overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies have not only failed, but are simply "people as the cutting board, and we as the fish and meat," old wounds not healed, new pains piled up. Please look at the Guangdong Governor Zhang Zhidong's report in 1886 (Guangxu 12th year) on the suffering of more than 70,000 overseas Chinese in Batavia, please look at the Minister to the Netherlands and Austria, Lü Haihuan's memorial in 1901 (Guangxu 27th year), bitterly denouncing the atrocities of the Dutch authorities against overseas Chinese. In 1740, the Dutch officially ordered the massacre of our overseas Chinese, the fire in Batavia lit up the sky, cries echoed everywhere, the old and young, women and children all died under the Dutch axes, blood flowed everywhere, even the river water turned red, with over ten thousand dead, historically known as the "Red River Massacre," an unprecedented tragedy!</p>
<p>After the victory of the War of Resistance, our two million compatriots in the Dutch East Indies are still trapped in deep waters. For example: (1) In the conflict between the Allied forces and Indonesians in Surabaya, over a thousand overseas Chinese were bombed to death, and 15,000 were left homeless; (2) In Cibaduyut, bombed by the Allied forces, hundreds of our overseas Chinese died; (3) During the tug-of-war between the two sides, Jiao Han became a battlefield, and hundreds of our overseas Chinese went missing; (4) All overseas Chinese in Padang were besieged, suffering endlessly; (5) In Medan, over 20,000 overseas Chinese were subjected to 621 incidents of arson and looting within half a year; (6) Over 3,300 Chinese refugees in Bekasi were unable to live in peace; (7) The bloody tragedy of the large-scale massacre in Tangerang has not yet dried, and the Baken tragedy followed one after another, with 200 overseas Chinese dying in self-defense. In addition, overseas Chinese engaged in business suffered even more severely, with the Indonesian government raising import and export taxes to an alarming extent, while the Dutch East Indies government intercepted 40 of our overseas Chinese merchant ships, and detained and humiliated the crew, resulting in losses of over 700,000 national currency units.</p>
<p>The motherland couldn't bear it anymore, and the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, after rushing about since last year, finally managed to produce a Dutch East Indies Comfort Mission. This organization is composed of representatives from the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Overseas Department, among others. After Special Envoy Li's departure, we heard about this comfort mission, and couldn't help but offer a few words of advice. The members constituting the comfort mission must have a sound organization and act in unison, avoiding individual activities. China should be a "nation of ten thousand chariots," and representatives going abroad must have the demeanor of "ten thousand chariots." What is valued in overseas Chinese affairs experts and diplomats is that their vision should be placed far ahead and in the future. Wang Anshi said to Zeng Zigou, "Reading the classics alone is not enough to understand the classics," meaning that one must read other books to understand the classics. Handling overseas Chinese affairs and diplomacy should be even more so, and one should look for problems outside the problems, and then one can solve the problems.</p>
<p>The representatives must have a thorough understanding of the history, geography, politics, economy, society, and ethnicity of the Dutch East Indies, especially religion. In addition to extending warm comfort to our overseas Chinese compatriots, who are like branches connected to the same root, one should also bring some education to them, and even more so encourage them and remind them. Justice always triumphs in the end. In all matters under heaven, "if you act and do not succeed, turn inward and examine yourself." One should truly put in effort with the Dutch, the Indonesians, and even relevant third-country individuals, and merely saying "neutrality" is still not enough.</p>
<p>We want to respectfully tell the Dutch that you have ruled the Dutch East Indies for three hundred years, and to this day you have left 90 percent of the people illiterate on this fertile land, which is a great shame. The People's Council (Volksraad), established in 1918, although improved twice in 1922 and 1925, still had representatives from not universally representative classes, and too narrow of powers, which was a great mistake. The general population lives too poorly, lingering on the brink of starvation all year round, with wages earned in your hands only 50 cents to 1.15 yuan per week, with an average daily income of only two cents per person, which is a great source of disaster. You have harmed overseas Chinese with bloody means, and having suffered the ravages of fascism yourselves, you relied on China's War of Resistance and the Allied victory, and you have returned to the East, taking the atrocities that the fascists used against you to inflict upon your ally China's overseas Chinese compatriots, which is even more despicable! The world is changing, and you should change too! If you don't change, others will force you to change. We advise the Dutch East Indies government to be smarter, let the long-oppressed people breathe a sigh of relief, and suffer less, so as to avoid them going astray, resulting in a lose-lose situation.</p>
<p>At the same time, we want to offer a few words of sincere advice to the Indonesians: In three hundred years, you have launched more than seventy anti-Dutch movements, from the patriotic beginnings of the youth organization Budi Utomo, through the leftist Islamic League and religious political reform movements, the major strikes of the PFB trade union, the non-cooperation of the Communist Party, all the way to the truly nationalist movement of the All-Indonesia Party (PNI), we have always remembered them. Supporting small and weak nations is the national policy set by Sun Yat-sen, and if there is anyone in the world who can truly sympathize with you and help you, it should be China. You have 735,267 square miles of fertile land, equal to the combined area of France, Italy, Austria, and Sweden; you account for 97 percent of the 67 million people; you have 130 ethnic groups, 25 written languages, and 250 dialects, and you should strengthen unity, strengthen unification, and strengthen trust in your fraternal country, China.</p>
<p>The overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies help local prosperity. They are empty-handed, with no national military force as a backing, and even less with any intention of encroachment. They have all been baptized by the Chinese Kingly Way culture, are the most benevolent, the most peaceful, "all within the four seas are brothers," is the overseas Chinese way of life. During the war, although the enemy used malicious instigation and poisonous propaganda, saying that the Chinese are "aggressors," the overseas Chinese should always be in contact with the Indonesians, and use iron facts to prove who is the hegemon and who is the aggressor. The overseas Chinese cannot merely use "neutrality" as an excuse to avoid reality, and must, in light of the current problems in the Dutch East Indies, advise the Indonesians to have right and wrong, to distinguish friends from enemies, and never fall into the enemy's trap! The comfort mission must remind the Indonesians for the sake of the overseas Chinese: they must know that reckless and murderous butchers can never kill their way to heaven! Seeking the sympathy of the Indonesians from the pure overseas Chinese is the greatest wish!</p>
<h3>Many Illnesses in the Cool Autumn</h3>
<p>Autumn has arrived, and the weather has suddenly turned cooler. While cholera has receded, diseases such as malaria, typhoid fever, and colds have arrived on time. Birth, old age, sickness, and death are the four major sufferings of life, and sickness is a barrier between life and death. Although it may not be the most serious, it is still a blow to both the spirit and the body.</p>
<p>According to recent reports, there seem to be especially many cases of diphtheria. The hot summer has receded, and the bitter cold has not yet arrived. This temperature should be the most comfortable weather for life, but unexpectedly, this not-hot-not-cold climate is also suitable for the propagation of germs. We should especially take care to protect our health in this suitable weather.</p>
<p>Now, the cost of living has risen alarmingly, and getting sick is even more unaffordable! For serious illnesses, asking a doctor for a house call has reached the shocking price of 100,000 yuan per visit; only after 5 p.m. can some doctors' house call fees be reduced to a still-substantial 50,000 yuan, but for those suffering from acute illnesses, life is at risk in an instant, how can they leisurely wait until dusk? This is just the consultation fee, and there are also handling fees, medicine fees, and tips for the doctor's driver, which patients find difficult to bear. Outpatient visits are slightly cheaper, usually 10,000 yuan per visit, but in the short space of a morning, many patients are crowded into the small clinic of a famous doctor, and there are even those who pay extra fees to jump the queue. Thus, those who are poor and suffering from serious and acute illnesses have no choice but to await death. Municipal and public hospitals charge far less than private doctors, but with Shanghai's population so large, its area so vast, and public finances so strained, it is impossible to provide ordinary services to the city's sick. Under these circumstances, everyone who falls ill in Shanghai cannot help but deeply lament their suffering.</p>
<p>The purpose of practicing medicine is to save the world, and doctors are respected because they hold the lofty ambition of helping the world and saving people. Unexpectedly, due to the impact of the war, all of this is now out of the question. If we calculate a doctor's fee of 100,000 yuan per house call, a doctor with a little status will have a monthly income many times higher than the monthly salary of a national president? In addition, there are income from outpatient visits, income from prescriptions, and income from handling fees, and their monthly income is often astonishing. Practicing medicine has become a private tool for making money. The harm that this phenomenon does to society and the deep pain that individuals suffer is difficult to express. No wonder the British Labour government also advocates nationalizing medicine.</p>
<p>Currently, there are restrictions on everything, price controls on rice and oil, gold sales, and the prohibition of trading in US dollars. Even the fares for rickshaws and pedicabs were announced with a standard not long ago. But for medical expenses, which are a matter of life and death, doctors are allowed to extort arbitrarily, and it has not been heard that the health authorities have said a word, or that the municipal authorities have issued a decree, to seek a penny of life for the city's sick people. Doctors and their families naturally need to live, which is a matter of course, but doctors' work cannot just be about making money. If you want to make a fortune, just do business straightforwardly, but as for doctors, they have a sacred responsibility in addition to living.</p>
<p>We demand that the health authorities immediately and thoroughly investigate the fee situation of doctors in the city, and then take the most rapid measures to impose reasonable restrictions. Who can guarantee to be free from illness all year round? When a person is sick and needs to see a doctor and take medicine, the need is more urgent than eating when not sick, and the suffering of being poor and sick is probably something that friends with plenty to eat and wear cannot understand even a fraction of. The municipal authorities should now pay attention to this issue as all measures are gradually getting on track.</p>
<p>We absolutely have no intention of attacking any doctor. Logically, doctors' work is dangerous and hard, and collecting consultation fees is justified. However, for the sake of the health of the city's citizens, we must oppose the small number of greedy and profit-seeking unethical doctors who use practicing medicine as a private tool for making a fortune. As this deep autumn arrives, almost every family has children, wives, or themselves, or other family members, who are having a new experience with autumn illnesses, whether mild or severe. Whether it is consultation fees, medicine fees, or handling fees, none of them are not the greatest sorrow for salaried workers. Today, the majority of people have reached the point where they cannot live, cannot die, and even cannot afford to be sick. A very large and serious problem is emerging in Shanghai society. The municipal authorities should do everything possible to solve this problem and reduce some of the suffering of the poor and sick citizens.</p>

<h3>Security of Transportation Lines in Northern Jiangsu Can Be Guaranteed, Post-War Affairs in Townships Actively Handled, Remaining Communist Troops Actually Massacring the People</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper in Gaoyou, 13th] The commander of the 25th Division of the National Army, Huang Baishao, arrived in Gaoyou on the morning of the 12th, when soldiers and civilians alike reached the county seat, the people all hung the Blue Sky White Sun national flag and set off firecrackers to welcome them. The order in Gaoyou City has now been restored. The use of the anti-currency has also been stopped, and the Central China Bank, the Bank of Communications, the Agricultural Bank, and the Provincial Bank have established offices, and the serious currency system problem can now be easily solved. After the recovery of the entire line along the Grand Canal, the security of all highway and waterway transportation problems can be guaranteed, but the security order in the countryside of Gaoyou and Baoying counties is very worrying. The National Army is now actively handling post-war affairs in the townships, and is being very lenient, and has issued proclamations, allowing all people who have been coerced by the Communist troops to participate in work to register for self-renewal with the respective township offices. However, there are still a few bad elements in these two counties who collude with the remaining Communist troops to oppress good people and disturb the security. People in Northern Jiangsu are unanimously hoping that the central and Jiangsu provincial authorities will quickly eliminate the remaining Communist troops in the rural areas along the Grand Canal. For this major plan of elimination, it is appropriate to quickly come up with a solution and seek a unified plan for post-war affairs. The relief work in Northern Jiangsu has now been actively launched. Commander Huang is convening people from all walks of life to discuss thorough post-war solutions for relief work in Gaoyou City and rural areas. According to reports, in the Zhuoyang Lake rural area at the border of Gaoyou and Jiangdu, there are still a small number of remaining Communist troops who are arbitrarily ravaging the area and do not hesitate to kill many people. More than one hundred people were killed the day before yesterday, and the situation is extremely tragic. At the same time, similar situations have occurred in the rural areas of Fanchuan and Xiaoji towns. This matter is extremely worthy of attention. It is heard that Commander Huang is now preparing to start suppressing them in order to achieve the goal of ensuring local security and stabilizing people's livelihoods.</p>
<p>[Another dispatch] This newspaper's special correspondent, Fang Canglang, left Zhenjiang on the afternoon of the 12th, taking with him the elder generation of Taibao newspapers, and took a boat to Shaobo and Gaoyou in the recovered area of Northern Jiangsu to provide spiritual food for comforting the soldiers and civilians in the front lines.</p>
<h3>The Homecoming Corps Undertakes Night Patrols, Raids Qidong Again, Posts Slogans and Propaganda, and Returns</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper in Nanpu] The various units that went to the various ports of this county on the 8th to carry out a second raid returned at midnight on the 10th. According to reports, the units participating in this raid included the First Brigade of the Homecoming Corps, the Water Police Team, the Police Detachment, and part of the First Security Detachment. Late at night on the 8th, taking advantage of the initial rising tide, they departed in eleven civilian boats, divided into two routes. One route went to Yongchang Port in this county, led by Sun Xuxian, the chief of the police detachment, and the other route went to Yonglong Port in this county, led by Shi Zhengqiu, the chief of the First Brigade of the Homecoming Corps. The route to Yongchang Port failed to set sail due to the tide and wind direction, and joined the other route at Yonglong Port in the evening of the 9th. The Communist troops stationed in this port were part of Cao Shiying's unit of the Southeast Guard Regiment, consisting of more than forty people, carrying a light machine gun. After the units landed, they were on strict alert while searching forward. At that time, the bright moon was in the sky, and autumn insects were chirping. The residents were all awakened from their dreams. The Communist troops, upon learning of our landing, first fired a gun to demonstrate. Our units immediately returned fire and simultaneously advanced in different directions. For a time, gunfire broke the silence of the long night. After more than ten minutes, the Communist troops were unable to withstand and retreated north. The units, having completed their mission, rested briefly in the town, and after posting slogans and propaganda, returned on the original boats within the specified time. According to Sun Xuxian, the chief of the police detachment, all ports in this county are stationed with the Communist Southeast Guard Regiment, militiamen, and tax collectors, but the number of people is extremely uncertain, and their purpose is purely to collect taxes and inspect incoming and outgoing ships, and their strength is minimal and cannot withstand a single blow. When the reporter inquired about how the materials seized by the various units in the first raid were handled, it was said that the seized materials were mostly printed cloth, broad beans, newsprint, and buttons, and that these materials were directly related to the Communist troops. After investigation, it has now been clarified that the materials of merchants who were not colluding with the Communist troops have been returned one by one by the county government, while the various materials related to the Communist troops have to be dealt with.</p>

<h3>Disaster in Dongting Xishan</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper in Suzhou] Dongting Xishan suffered continuous heavy rain at the beginning of summer. Fortunately, the local authorities and the Suzhou Fellow Villagers Association did their best to help, using motorized boats to pump water day and night, so that the farmland was spared from being submerged, and the farmers were able to breathe a sigh of relief. However, on the 23rd of last month, they were suddenly hit by a hurricane, followed by torrential rain, which caused the water level to rise sharply by more than two feet. More than 2,800 mu of polder land in the Donghe Town, Qixian Township, and Dongyuan Township under its jurisdiction were all submerged. The rice ears were also blown by the hurricane and immersed in the water. The early rice had already sprouted and looked severely like a seedling field and was completely lost. If the late rice can be rescued urgently, there may be a 10-20% harvest. Yesterday, Zhu Rongqing, the town chief of Donghe Town in the area, together with local people, publicly elected Zhu Chuansheng to go to Wuxi via Suzhou to hire four motorized boats to transport to the mountains day and night to pump water in order to carry out emergency rescue. In addition to jointly submitting a report to the district office, county government, and temporary council by the township chiefs, they also telegraphed the Xishan Suzhou Fellow Villagers Association to call for relief.</p>
<p>[Another report] More than 400 mu of paddy fields in Guanchang Township, First District, were flooded due to heavy rain, and all were submerged. The autumn harvest is imminent, and all hope has been lost. Hundreds of farming families have been affected, and the disaster is severe. Township Chief Shi Yushan specially submitted reports to the County Temporary Council, County Government, District Office, Food and Grain Office, and the Field Industry Improvement Association on the 11th to find ways for relief.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Province Approved for Appropriation to Build Prisons and Courts</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper in Hangzhou, 13th] Although the facilities of the judicial organs in the counties of Zhejiang are better than those of other provinces in the country, only six counties in the province did not fall during the eight years of the War of Resistance, and the various recommendations were greatly destroyed by the artillery fire. The judicial organs were not spared, and only a few places such as Hangzhou and Yin County suffered less loss, while other places, even if they were complete, were old and unsuitable for use. Therefore, how to urgently seek reconstruction has become a top priority. When Xie Guansheng, Minister of Judicial Administration, came to Hangzhou, he investigated the situation in detail. It is now learned that he has agreed to allocate 2.5 billion yuan for the construction of prisons and courts throughout Zhejiang Province, of which Hangzhou can allocate more than 1.2 billion yuan, but the fundamental construction still requires a large amount of assistance from the central government.</p>
<h3>Zhou Zhongyue Arrives in Hangzhou</h3>

<h3>Rampant Banditry on the Border of Wu, Dan, and Jin Counties; Self-Defense Team Firearms Confiscated; Eight Team Members Kidnapped and Brutally Murdered</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Wujin] Wujin is situated in the heart of the Nanjing-Shanghai railway line, bordered by the Yangtze River to the north, Lake Ge to the southwest, adjacent to Danyang and Jintan, and bordering Lake Tai to the southeast. It is a vast plain with fields of grain, originally the wealthiest land of fish and rice in the Jiangnan region. However, after eight years of enemy and puppet regime devastation and banditry, its vitality has been almost entirely depleted. In particular, the border area between Wu, Dan, and Jin, with its complex terrain and inconsistent governance, has recently become a nest for bandit gangs, with tragic killings and atrocities occurring frequently. On the eve of National Day, at midnight, a case of bandit gangs attacking the self-defense team and seizing firearms occurred again in Houxu Town, District 2, more than forty li southwest of Wujin city. As a result, all the firearms of the self-defense team were confiscated, and more than eleven team members were killed or injured. Since the firearms of the self-defense team in Dong'an Town, District 9, adjacent to Houxu, were completely confiscated by bandits last month on the 20th, people have been feeling anxious. This case has caused widespread shock, and the security of the rural areas has become an increasing concern. The rural populace is universally feeling insecure. If timely suppression is not carried out, a single spark will start a prairie fire, and the aftermath is deeply worrying.</p>
<p>Midnight Attack</p>
<p>Houxu is a large market town in the southwest of Wujin, but its location near Lake Ge, with access to Dan and Jin to the west, has always been a haven for bandit gangs. On April 26th of this year, the self-defense team in the town had five long and short firearms confiscated by bandits, and team member Wang Jinsheng was shot in three places. Five months passed, and the murder case was never solved. Unexpectedly, before one wave had subsided, another arose, and a second firearm confiscation suddenly occurred. The reason was that the four villages of Qinhe, Houxu, Xuyou, and Jinfeng in District 2 formed a joint self-defense team. The county assigned Zhu Wenyu to be responsible for supervision and training, with 25 rifles, 1 light machine gun, and 5 pistols. The strength was quite substantial. Stationed in Houxu Town, at midnight on the 9th of this month, the self-defense team sentries initially saw a child approaching from afar, whose behavior was suspicious. They took him to the team for questioning. Upon their return, gunshots suddenly rang out. Bandit leader Zhuang Ziming (a local) led a gang of fifty or sixty bandits, surging towards the self-defense team from three directions. The self-defense team members hastily fought back. For a time, gunshots rang out, and bullets rained down. After about an hour of fierce fighting, team members Zhang Qinghai and Yang Fu were seriously injured, and Jiang Quangen died in the line of duty. Four bandits were also killed and four or five were injured. Helplessly, because the self-defense team ran out of ammunition and had nothing to fight with, the bandits took advantage of the situation to surround them and force them to surrender their weapons. Twenty-two rifles, one machine gun, and two quick-firing guns were confiscated. All the equipment and utensils of the entire team were collected together and set on fire. Before leaving, in addition to carrying away the bandit corpses and injured bandits, they also kidnapped deputy commander Dai Chuanxun, Duan Jiyuan, machine gunner Yang Zhenhua, and team members Yu Longsheng, Shi Kunsheng, Yu Fengsheng, and others, a total of eight people. They were taken to the Fuzong Ancestral Hall in Huangnidun, more than two li southwest of the town, where they were brutally murdered one by one. Their bodies were dismembered, and their flesh and blood were blurred. The methods were cruel and unbearable to witness. Afterward, the District 2 District Office immediately reported the situation to the county government and suggested that supervisor Zhu Wenyu be prosecuted for leaving the team that night and failing to defend the area. After receiving the report, the county government immediately reported the situation to the Capital Garrison Headquarters, the Wuxi Command Post, the Provincial Security Command, and the District 2 Commissioner's Office, as well as the Danyang Joint Defense Command and other agencies, awaiting instructions.</p>
<p>Elusive Bandit Traces</p>
<p>According to those familiar with the rural areas, bandit gangs are everywhere in the rural areas these days. They form small groups of three or five, lurking and rising at night, elusive and unpredictable. Upon hearing of any major activity, they can gather fifty or sixty people, or even more than a hundred, with complete firearms. The villagers know where they stay, but they dare not report it. If they do, death will immediately follow. The areas where they often lurk are the border areas of the three counties of Wu, Dan, and Jin, such as Dong'an, Dadun, Caixi, Laohezhuang, Lizhuangqiao, Huangtang, Zhanglou, etc., which are their frequent haunts. The bandit leaders are Xue Bin and Zhuang Ziming. They constantly roam every night, forcibly collecting land taxes everywhere, stipulating fifteen dan of white rice per village. If anyone refuses, they will be assassinated. The villagers are forced by their power and influence to pay in order to avoid danger, causing them unbearable suffering. They all deeply hope that the army can suppress them in the shortest possible time and relieve the people from their distress.</p>
<h3>Wuxi Self-Government Tax Revenue Exceeds 90 Million Last Month</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Wuxi] The five self-government taxes collected by the county's tax collection office, including business licenses, vehicle licenses, entertainment tax, slaughter tax, and property tax, totaled 90,967,323 yuan in September. The revenue from deed tax was 49 million yuan. In addition, the business tax has already been collected and will be investigated starting next Monday.</p>
<h3>Suzhou Conscription to Begin Immediately; Jiangyin to Hold Draft Lottery Today</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Suzhou] This county has been ordered to implement conscription. The quota approved by the provincial government is 980. The county government has decided on the distribution method at a meeting of district chiefs, with conscription based on the bao (group of households) as the unit, and each district conscripting an average number of recruits. District 1: 300 recruits, District 2: 80 recruits, District 3: 63 recruits, District 4: 86 recruits, District 5: 48 recruits, District 6: 128 recruits, District 7: 50 recruits, District 8: 48 recruits, District 9: 48 recruits, District 10: 42 recruits, District 11: 28 recruits, District 12: 21 recruits, District 13: 30 recruits, totaling 980 recruits.

Migrants, vagrants, and adventurers will also be recruited.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Jiangyin] This county has been ordered to handle the first phase of conscription. The county government has organized a conscription committee to actively handle the matter. The roster of eligible men from each district and town has been completed. On the 13th, eligible men will go to designated hospitals for physical examinations. On the 14th, a lottery will be held at the county government to determine the conscripts. The selected conscripts will be announced within 1-2 days and will report on a specified date. They will then undergo temporary training for half a month before being sent to the Wuxi Corps Area for collective training.</p>
<h3>Bandit Suppression in Zhangzhu</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Zhangzhu] Yixing's Zhangzhu borders the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, with thousands of mountains and valleys. Therefore, bandits appear and disappear unpredictably, and the local area has suffered greatly. A troop has recently been dispatched to the mountains to begin suppression. County Magistrate Guo, accompanied by Secretary Xu of the county party headquarters, made a special trip to Zhangzhu to convene a meeting of the district office, party headquarters, chamber of commerce, town hall, youth league, and all the bao chiefs and industry directors of Zhangzhu to instruct them on three important policies: reorganizing the baojia system, electing councilors, and eradicating opium. Separate meetings were also held with the heads of each township to inquire about the local bandit situation and various tasks.</p>
<h3>Illegal Operation of Suzhou Public Buses Arouses Public Opinion; County Provisional Council Launches Fierce Criticism</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Suzhou] After the Jinshan Motor Company started operating public buses in the city, the county government, considering that it concerned the public welfare and transportation of the citizens of Suzhou, sent a letter to the Provisional Council to investigate whether the company complied with the construction regulations. The council sent Deputy Speaker Fan Gongren and councilors Zhang Shoupeng and others to conduct an inquiry on the morning of the 3rd. After days of extensive interviews and consultations, they have prepared an investigation report. A reporter notes that the issue of public buses in the city has previously sparked fierce debate in society. Some believe that if public buses are not operated, then so be it. If they are operated, they must be fully equipped and safe, and should be invested in and operated by local entities. Others believe that the operation of public buses is an evolution of social transportation, and even if it is simple and crude at the beginning, or if it is impossible to attract local investment, it should be encouraged and assisted. The debate has continued until now without a conclusion. Although the Construction Department has strictly ordered the Jinshan Company to organize and operate according to the former principle, it is doubtful whether they will comply. The society is paying close attention to this matter. The reporter specially visited Councilor Zhang Shoupeng, who participated in the investigation, and received his ten points of opinion: (1) Although the capital is 100 million yuan, there is a certificate issued by an accountant, but there are no formal account books or proof of verification for verification. (2) The company claims to have adopted the method of establishment by initiation, and the fixed capital is fully subscribed and paid by the founders, without publicly soliciting shares in the local area. (3) When the company applied for registration and permission, it stated that the location was No. 224 Jingde Road, but now it claims that there is another general management office in Shanghai. Therefore, all important documents and account books are kept at the general office in Shanghai. If this is not an excuse, it is clearly inconsistent with the original articles of association. (4) There are currently seven trucks, and all the equipment is incomplete and unsafe. They are simply called temporary public buses. According to Deputy Manager Hu Qida, there are also 111 new vehicles that will soon arrive in Suzhou, and ten more bodies have been purchased to be gradually assembled into formal public buses, each worth about 9.4 million yuan. However, according to the company's business plan, the method of using capital to install vehicles is 90 million yuan, but the vehicles purchased now exceed the total capital. If this is not empty talk, it is clearly contradictory. (5) It was originally planned to open two lines first, but only one line is currently operating, and it does not match the original route map. (6) The actual daily revenue is about 1 million yuan, which is much less than the original budget. This shows that the estimated budget is either deliberately reduced or too inaccurate. (7) This public welfare transportation undertaking is completely controlled by the thirteen founders and shareholders, who monopolize the benefits. This is unreasonable and cannot be ignored for the sake of the entire Suzhou area. (8) The biggest legal basis for the company's establishment and operation is only a business license from the Provincial Highway Bureau. However, it is doubtful whether the operation of public buses in the city is under the jurisdiction of the Provincial Highway Bureau. (9) Su and Huan, two companies organized by local people, have also complied with the construction regulations and submitted a request to the county government for permission to operate public buses in the city. The county government has ignored them, which is ignoring the laws, regulations, and public opinion, and cannot be ignored. (10) Jiang Zhongyi, the chief of the county construction section, privately dispatched investigators to Jinshan Company to be responsible for auditing. Whether this is appropriate should also be studied. At the 23rd resident meeting of the Provisional Council, based on the above ten points, the Jinshan Motor Company and the county government were severely criticized. It was believed that it was both illegal and unpopular, and it was decided to send a letter back to the county government to report to the province for handling.</p>
<h3>Woman Hangs Herself from a Beam After Losing Money Trading Yarn</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Jiangyin] Recently, the market price of yarn has been fluctuating, making it difficult for those who trade in it to maintain stability. Zhu Yonghong, a resident of Zhujiatun, Yaosai Township, and his wife, Dai, were trading in yarn and had lost more than 2 million yuan. They sold three mu of land, but it was still not enough. On the night of the 9th, his wife, Dai, hanged herself to death.</p>
<h3>Tunxi Detective Squad Leader Protects Opium Dens</h3>
<p>[Tunxi] The Seventh District Commissioner's Office yesterday received a confidential report that Yu Bin (aka Yu Baiqing), a patrol officer and detective squad leader of the Tunxi Police Bureau, was suspected of protecting opium dens. The Commissioner's Office immediately ordered the Tunxi Police Bureau to detain and interrogate Patrol Officer Yu Bin. It also dispatched personnel to conduct investigations based on the clues in the confidential report, arresting two opium offenders and confiscating opium paraphernalia, and sent them to the Commissioner's Office for legal processing.</p>
<h3>Automobile Lane on Top Layer of Qiantang River Bridge to be Temporarily Repaired with Foreign Pine; Permanent Repairs to be Studied and Designed in the Long Term</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from Hangzhou, 13th] The Qiantang River Railway Bridge was blown up by the National Army during the retreat in November 1937. The Japanese army actively repaired it starting in 1941, and it was finally opened to trains. However, the automobile lane on the top layer is still destroyed for five spans, more than 1,000 feet long. It has now been contracted to the Dongya Construction Company. Ironworkers and carpenters have been brought in from Shanghai. The design engineer is Yuan Zhigang of the China Bridge Company. According to Yuan, the current work is to replace the concrete with foreign pine to pave the bridge surface and repair the severely damaged steel frames so that automobiles weighing less than 20 tons can pass. At the same time, the road south of the bridge to Xiaoshan, which has also been destroyed for about one kilometer, will also be repaired to the point where it can be opened to traffic. The entire project is expected to be completed within two months. As for permanent repairs, they will be studied and designed in the long term.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Provincial Government Decides to Hold Special Meeting to Discuss and Implement Resolutions of the Provincial Council</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Hangzhou, 13th] The 208 resolutions of the first general meeting of the Zhejiang Provincial Council have been delivered to the provincial government and relevant agencies one by one. They will be delivered within the next few days. In order to carefully consider the implementation of these resolutions, the provincial government has decided to hold a special government committee meeting dedicated to discussing implementation methods. According to a responsible person of the provincial government, they will try their best to respect the opinions of the people's representative body and implement them, unless it is absolutely necessary to refuse to comply. However, for some resolutions that require a central government decision, the provincial government can only forward its opinions.</p>

<p>Not long ago, at the Xikang Road/Changshou Road terminal of the No. 24 trolleybus, whenever an empty bus turned around, the passengers on the platform would rush forward, scrambling to get on. The disorder was unbearable to describe. Often, the young and strong would push their way through, disregarding everything. Women, children, and the elderly and infirm would be pushed down. Clothes would be torn, and there would even be shouts and cries. In this kind of situation, getting on the bus was like escaping a disaster. No one would believe that such a chaotic scene existed unless they had experienced it firsthand. Because I live there and have to go to the central district for work every day, I have been suffering from the crowding for more than a day. But at that time, there was no police officer to maintain order, and the chaos and jostling continued. However, since last month, the order has suddenly improved. Whether old or young, men or women, people line up in a single file, and enter the bus in an orderly manner when it arrives. There is no more rushing and jostling. It turns out that several military police are regularly maintaining order at the station. It is said that they were sent by the Putuo District. From then on, residents in that area no longer have to worry about taking the bus. I hope that other stations can also have the same measures taken, and the passengers will be extremely grateful.</p>

<p>Streetlights Should be Monitored to Save Electricity</p>
<p>In order to save electricity, the water and electricity companies in this city have stopped supplying outdoor neon lights, etc., reducing consumption and advocating thrift. This is indeed a good way. However, the streetlights on the roads are inevitably a little dim, especially on the side streets and lanes, where it is simply impossible to see clearly. At a time when there are many vehicles, each driving at full speed and advancing like flying, one cannot help but worry that there will be collisions due to the darkness and blurring. In addition, many tricycles and bicycles do not turn on their lights in accordance with the regulations. This is very dangerous. It is hoped that the police authorities will pay attention to this and strictly urge all vehicles to turn on their lights at night and to drive more slowly. On the one hand, this will reduce the harm of accidents, and on the other hand, it will preserve the excellent system of saving electricity.</p>

<p>Request for More Early Morning Ferry Services</p>
<p>We are a group of residents of Pudong who have to go to Shanghai for work every day. The round trip twice a day depends entirely on the municipal ferry. However, since the abolition of summer time on October 1, the ferry company has changed the sailing schedule in order to connect with the trains on the Shanghai-Chuansha Railway. The difference compared to before is very large, and in the morning, it is necessary to wait until 9:00 to get from Wusong to Shanghai, which will inevitably cause delays in work. I recently read in your newspaper that the ferry company has newly completed the "Jiangsu" ferry, which will also be added to the Songhu Line. I am very pleased to read this. Therefore, please reveal our grievances in one corner of the newspaper, hoping that the ferry company can adopt my humble opinion and add more early morning services so that we can arrive in Shanghai around 8:00, which would be a public convenience. (A group of residents from Donggou and Qingning Temple)</p>
<p>Questioning Unreasonable Rent Increases</p>
<p>(1) I rented a small attic room from the Xie family in April 1945 for a monthly rent of 300 yuan. In March of this year, I received a notice from the landlord saying that the rent would be increased, but he did not specify how much. It was not until September of this year that he said that the rent would be increased to 7,000 yuan per month starting from March, which is about 25 times the original amount. If the price of goods rises and the rent increases, it is reasonable, but it must be in accordance with the fair market price to be reasonable. The Municipal Council decided that there was no need to increase the rent at all and cracked down on the extra demands of second landlords. While submitting it to the municipal government for approval, the second landlord actually increased the rent by 25 times. Is this reasonable? It is even more unreasonable to retroactively collect the increased rent of 25 times from March in September. In the same neighborhood, regardless of the quality of the houses, some increased by 70 times, some by 60 times, and some by 16 or 17 times. Is this legal? — In summary of the above two points, I humbly request the wise and virtuous Standing Bureau to pay attention to this and have a proper solution.</p>

<h3>Diplomatic Center of Gravity to Shift to New York; Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference to be Held on November 1st; Chinese Delegation to UN General Assembly Departs India for US</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 13th] A British Foreign Office spokesperson announced today that the Four-Power talks will be held "formally" on the luxury liner "Aquitania," which is scheduled to carry the delegates of various countries to New York in the last week of October. It is reported that the only one confirmed to be traveling to New York on the ship is British Foreign Secretary Bevin. Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov is expected to leave Southampton on Wednesday aboard the "Queen Elizabeth." US Secretary of State Byrnes plans to fly to Washington. French Prime Minister Bidault may not be able to depart for a while due to the elections and will fly to New York later. The "Aquitania" is expected to leave Southampton on October 27, which means it will arrive in New York ten days after the opening of the UN General Assembly.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, New Delhi, 13th] The Chinese delegation to the UN General Assembly is scheduled to leave here for New York this afternoon. The delegation met with Nehru here.</p>
<p>[Report] San Francisco, 13th Radio: The Indian delegation to the UN General Assembly left India today and flew to New York.</p>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 13th] The UN General Assembly will soon open in New York. The UN Secretariat has booked 100 rooms in various hotels for the delegations of various countries to settle in. However, the Foreign Ministers' Conference is also scheduled to be held in New York on November 1, so the US government, in its capacity as host, has booked another 50 rooms in various hotels for the Four-Power Foreign Ministers and their staff to reside in. The location of the Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference is in downtown New York City, while the old site of the UN General Assembly is the old site of the World's Fair in Long Island. The meeting place for the various committees is at Success Lake, about six miles from there. Many officials agree to use the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel as the meeting place for the Four Powers. One or two of the Four-Power Foreign Ministers may reside in that hotel. The government is planning not only for the accommodation of the various representatives but also for office space. The British delegations to the Security Council and the Economic and Social Council were the first to request a portion of the 1233rd floor of the Empire State Building as office space. The ordinary residents of the building have all moved out and are dedicated to the representatives attending the UN General Assembly. One British representative said that half of the members of my delegation sit on charity beds all day working, and those who sit in the office are almost knee-to-knee.</p>
<h3>Peace Conference Passes Treaty with Hungary; Decides to Convene Danube River Conference</h3>
<p>[Report] London, 13th Radio: The Paris Peace Conference is scheduled to close on the evening of the 15th. [United Press, Paris, 13th] The Peace Conference has completed all discussions on the Treaty with Hungary last night and is scheduled to begin discussing the Treaty with Finland next Monday. The terms of the Treaty with Hungary, which were passed last night, also stipulate freedom of navigation on the Danube River, the same as the Treaties with Romania and Bulgaria.</p>
<p>[French News Agency, 13th] The Peace Conference held a plenary meeting yesterday to review the Treaty with Hungary. France proposed convening an international conference of the Four Powers and the countries of the Danube River basin to discuss the issue of free navigation on the Danube River, which was passed by a two-thirds majority. At the same time, most of the political and territorial clauses of the Treaty with Hungary were quickly passed without discussion. Regarding the economic clauses, the clause regarding the Soviet Union's right to manage German-owned assets within Hungary was unanimously passed by the entire assembly.</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 12th] The plenary meeting of the Peace Conference today discussed the clauses of the Treaty with Hungary regarding reparations to the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia, which stipulated a total amount of 300 million US dollars. The United States proposed reducing it to 200 million US dollars, which was rejected by a vote of twelve to two. The original proposal was maintained. Only Canada supported the US proposal, and seven other countries abstained. The Peace Conference also passed other clauses stipulating that Hungary and Czechoslovakia should negotiate the issue of the withdrawal of 200,000 Hungarian minority people from the Czech border. Hungary should also cede three cities near the Danube River bank to Czechoslovakia to expand the province of Bratislava. Finally, military clauses were passed, limiting the Hungarian army to 65,000 men and the air force to 70 fighter jets, 20 transport aircraft, and 5,000 air force personnel. The General Assembly has completed the work of the eleventh week to date. There are four meetings left before the recess. There will be a recess on Sunday the 13th. Three meetings will be held on the 14th to pass the Treaty with Finland. The closing ceremony will be held on the 15th. All the above meetings will be presided over by French President and Foreign Minister Bidault.</p>
<h3>Organizing International Forces: The Soviet Union Has Not Refused</h3>
<p>[Agencia France-Presse, Succes Lake, 13th] According to a representative of France at the United Nations Military Staff Committee, the Soviet Union has not completely refused to participate in the establishment of an international peacekeeping force, as some American newspapers have claimed. The Soviet delegation submitted a memorandum to the United Nations Staff Committee stating that the Soviet Union refused to declare the number of troops it would contribute to the international peacekeeping force until a real international crisis arose that required intervention by such a force. This proves that the Soviet Union has not completely rejected the plans proposed by China, the United States, Britain, and France. It is reported that the four countries have already provided the Staff Committee with all the necessary information for its future work, while the Soviet Union has only provided the first part of its information, without indicating the troops it would deploy or how they would be allocated. However, negotiations are frequently held between the Soviet delegation and other delegations, and a compromise may be possible.</p>
<h3>The Price of Peace</h3>
<p>An Account from the French Foreign Ministry</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 12th] The accounts of the French Foreign Ministry show that the price of peace is 1,300,585 yuan. In the two and a half months since the conference began, the French government has spent an average of 10,170 yuan per day on behalf of the representatives of twenty-one countries.</p>
<h3>The Soviet Union Promotes the Five-Year Plan, Actively Preparing for a New War: Former Soviet Metal Factory Director Writes in British Newspaper</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 13th] Kravchenko, who announced his defection from the Soviet Communist Party in the United States two years ago, wrote an article in the London Sunday newspaper "World News," accusing Stalin of doing his best to prepare for a new war within the next generation. Kravchenko was originally the director and chief engineer of a Soviet metal factory, and he went to the United States to order goods. He recently published a book entitled "I Chose Freedom." In his article published in the newspaper today, he said: Stalin not only believes that there is a threat of a new war, but his government is also doing its best to prepare for this war, and its entire diplomatic and domestic policies can prove this.</p>
<p>Completion of Atomic Armaments is Only a Matter of Time</p>
<p>The purpose of the Soviet Union's Fourth Five-Year Plan is to increase its defense capabilities and equip the Red Army with the latest scientific technology. It is planned that by 1950, the production of its war machinery will increase fivefold. In addition to the ordnance department, a special department has been established to start building army and navy factories. There is no doubt that Stalin will be able to complete atomic armaments. All of this will defend the Soviet Union against whom? He does not use the national treasury to relieve the people's post-war suffering, but instead makes them more impoverished. What is his motive? Stalin blames others for the current war atmosphere, adopts Hitler's methods, blames Britain and the United States for his own actions, and shouts that British and American imperialism threatens the Soviet Union with a new war. Are they not political gamblers in the Kremlin?</p>
<p>Adopting Hitler's Methods to Achieve Political Goals</p>
<p>The purpose of this policy of the Soviet government is (1) to intimidate the Allies and engage in a war of nerves in order to obtain the maximum political and military concessions; (2) to prove to its own people the need for its large-scale military expansion plan; (3) to make the Soviet army firmly believe in the necessity of maintaining arms. Stalin's words and heart are contradictory, and his words and deeds are inconsistent. His purpose is to deceive Western countries. He conceals his political and military goals in Germany in order to deceive public opinion. He knows very well that a battle is currently underway to politically occupy Germany, and the result will affect the increase or decrease of his power in Europe. At the same time, large-scale purges are being carried out in Ukraine, Moscow, and Leningrad in the Soviet Union, and all those suspected of sympathizing with the West, neglecting Marxism, or his personal doctrines are being purged. Stalin knows very well that the atomic bomb is an important weapon, and no military secrets must be allowed to be known to Stalin, otherwise his goal of world revolution can really be realized.</p>
<p>The Dissolution of the Comintern is Completely a Smokescreen</p>
<p>The dissolution of the Communist International is completely a smokescreen. The policies of the Politburo are exactly the same as those of the Communist International. France's Thorez and Marty, Romania's Pauker, Hungary's Erno Gero, Italy's Togliatti, Bulgaria's Dimitrov and Kolarov, and Germany's Pieck are all implementing the Politburo's policies. They are its plenipotentiaries and listen to its commands. When considering their relationship with each other and with the Soviet Union, Western countries should not forget this fact, that in Stalin's eyes, today's England and its vigorous promotion of social reform are his number one enemy in terms of ideology and politics. Britain and the United States should abandon their prejudices and jointly strive for the principles of the Atlantic Charter, and become the spiritual support of other governments and peoples.</p>
<h3>The Resolution on Returning to the Muslim League Is Conveyed to the Viceroy of India</h3>
<p>The Content is Not Revealed</p>
<p>[United Press, New Delhi, 13th] Muslim League Secretary Ali Khan claimed today that the Muslim League Standing Committee has reached a resolution on whether to participate in the Indian independence plan, but refused to reveal the nature of the resolution. The Muslim League leader Jinnah has been asked to convey this resolution to the Viceroy of India, Lord Wavell, and it is expected that the Viceroy will make an announcement as a result. New Delhi newspapers generally expect that although direct negotiations between the Congress Party and the Muslim League have broken down, the Muslim League will still participate in the independence plan based on the conditions negotiated with Wavell. If it does not succeed, it will file a lawsuit with the United Nations.</p>
<h3>Egyptian Prime Minister to Fly to Britain on Wednesday to Discuss Treaty Revision Issues</h3>

<h3>The United States Plans to Set Up a Rocket Test Range, Britain is Also Conducting Secret Experiments, with the Farthest Range Able to Cross Half of Australia</h3>
<p>[United Press, South Yanton, 12th] Senator Gona of this state said today that he had received a phone call from Washington, learning that the government is planning to set up a test range, employing 36,000 people, to study rocket bombs, supersonic aircraft, and atomic energy. Survey teams are surveying the site of the test range. Military authorities will request funds from Congress next spring to carry out the project. The test range covers an area of fifty square miles and requires a large amount of electricity.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 12th, United Press] The Ministry of Supply announced today that a team of ten people led by Lieutenant General Eves has been selected to test secret rocket weapons, whose range is the farthest in the world, which will cross half of Australia and enter the Pacific Ocean. The Ministry of Supply estimates that the initial stage of this work will cost 50 million US dollars, and another 12 million US dollars will be spent a year later.</p>
<h3>Japan Attempts to Acquire Ryukyu, Politicians Privately Exchange Secret Documents, Confidently Believing That War Will Inevitably Break Out Between the United States and the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 12th] Japanese politicians are now privately exchanging a shocking document totaling seven pages, which explains Japan's future goals for the peace treaty with Japan. The document does not stipulate any specific clauses, but only reveals some guiding principles to enable the Japanese delegation attending the peace conference to follow. The document proposes inserting two special clauses in the preamble to the draft peace treaty with Japan: (1) condemning the right to make war, to show Japan's peaceful intentions, and (2) recognizing the equality of all races. Japan once advocated racial equality before the Versailles Peace Conference; as for territorial issues, Japan intends to obtain the trusteeship of the Ryukyu Islands (including Okinawa Island), because the islands have close ties with Japan in terms of tradition, race, and culture. No suggestions were made regarding the Kuril Islands, only stating that the issue of fishing rights in Soviet territorial waters requires Japanese diplomats to use all means. Japanese politicians have had mixed reactions to this document; however, most believe that it is inappropriate to insert clauses condemning the right to make war into international treaties. A senior politician told this agency's reporter: It is enough for us to insert clauses condemning the right to make war into the constitution, because war will inevitably break out between the United States and the Soviet Union in the future, so it is meaningless for us to insert such clauses into the treaty. The general political circles also believe that the issue of racial equality is inappropriate. If the Soviet Union agrees with this theory, other countries will inevitably rise up in opposition, and the result will be to make the Soviet Union ostensibly a protector of Asian nations, but in reality expand its power in the Far East. Japanese politicians unanimously agree that Japan should at least be able to acquire the Ryukyu Islands, and leave Okinawa Island to the United States as a military base.</p>

<h3>French Referendum: Deciding the Fate of the New Draft Constitution</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 13th] The French referendum on the new constitution began this morning in a harmonious atmosphere. Because it was a Sunday, the residents of Paris got up later. After getting up, they went directly to the polling stations to vote. To save procedures, voters only need to show their ID and election certificate. While voting was in progress, masses were being held in various churches, and voters from various churches gathered to discuss politics with great enthusiasm. Patients in the hospital either sat in wheelchairs or were helped by attendants to go to the polling stations to vote, while other patients used absentee voting methods. President Bidault voted at a polling station near the Ministry of Foreign Affairs building this morning. The president looked like an ordinary citizen, without guards, and smiled as he passed through the voter queue and put his ballot into the box. The situation in Marseille was not enthusiastic. As of 10:00 a.m., only 44,815 of the 315,000 voters had voted. During the voting in June, the same time had 70,400 people voting.</p>

<h3>The Normalization and Righteousness of Japan's Diet (Part 1)</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Tokyo Correspondent, 12th] The Japanese Diet is about to adjourn, and local elections are imminent. The Japanese political scene is gradually becoming active, and what the Japanese call the political season is about to begin. Recently, the most noteworthy aspect of the Japanese political scene is the concrete manifestation of the grand unity of conservative forces. The merger movement of the Liberal and Progressive parties and the rightward leaning of the Socialist Party all show that the task of political parties is to maintain the established political order, uphold vested rights and obligations, and represent a social group with an established power base. The basic form of Japanese society is capitalism; the fundamental mission of Japanese politics is to maintain the development of capitalism; but Japanese capitalism cannot overcome the original feudal productive relations, and has been closely connected with militarism since the Meiji Restoration, and its regressive nature has become increasingly strong. Although Japan has implemented parliamentary politics, it has not yet fully developed and is often restricted by militarism; therefore, the policies of established political parties are often wavering and unable to fulfill their historical mission, that is, unable to complete the democratic revolution in the capitalist stage. The historical task originally shouldered by the Liberal Party was the realization of democratic freedom. Although the Liberal Party once declared that freedom is the nature of man and maintaining freedom is the way of mankind, the Liberal Party's claims regarding the national polity openly support the existence of the Emperor system. When the Diet deliberated on the constitution, it unanimously advocated with the Progressive Party that the constitution should stipulate that the Emperor be the head of state. In other words, the sovereignty should belong to the Emperor. Although the Liberal Party once pretended to be democratic, it claimed in its emergency policy statement in November last year that war criminals should be severely punished, but the former president of the party, Ichiro Hatoyama, was on MacArthur's purge list, so he had no choice but to remove the president to serve as a shield. When the Diet opened, the constitutional expert Ozaki Yukio strongly scolded the Self-Defense Party for this move, believing that it was close to being dispatched. Amidst the current calls from the people for the realization of the party system, the Liberal Party actually pulled a bureaucrat who did not occupy a seat in the Diet to take over as president. It can be seen that the established political parties in Japan have no integrity, which fully demonstrates the regressive nature of Japanese politics. As for the Progressive Party, it is nothing more than an alias for the wartime Taisei Yokusankai and the Japanese Political Association. The constituent elements are mostly members of the Seiyukai and the Minseito. In the Seiyukai, there are people such as Nakajima Chikuhei of the Nakajima faction and Kuhara Fusanosuke of the Kuhara faction. In the past, the Minseito and the Seiyukai were originally incompatible, but in the history of Japanese political parties, it is not uncommon for two opposing political parties to mutually recommend pingfa [a term referring to people from the Mitsui or Mitsubishi zaibatsu] as party leaders and merge. For example, Okuma's Kaishinto and Itagaki's Jiyuto. The Liberal Party cooperated with Ito Hirobumi to establish the Seiyukai, while the Kaishinto joined the ranks of Katsura Taro to form the Doshikai, the successor of which was the Minseito. These two political parties were unable to purely grasp the political parties from the standpoint of the people's party, and they changed their stance midway. Another example is the Seiyukai, which once held the power by opposing the guanfa [bureaucratic clique] and the junfa [military clique], with Ito Hirobumi, Saionji Kinmochi, Hara Takashi, Takahashi Korekiyo, Tanaka Giichi, Inukai Tsuyoshi, and Suzuki Kisaburo as party leaders. The Minseito once held power with Katsura Taro, Kato Takaaki, Uchida Kosai, Hamaguchi Osachi, and Machida Chuji as party leaders. As a result, Japanese democracy and parliamentary politics have often been distorted because political parties compromise with hanbatsu [feudal clan cliques] and guanfa. The Progressive Party's recommendation of Shidehara as the leader of the Liberal Party is nothing more than a tactic of the regressive political history of Japan. The purpose of the Progressive Party in recommending Shidehara as the party leader is to use Shidehara's bureaucratic status to gain power; but this move unfortunately failed, so they turned to cooperate with the Liberal Party, recommending cabinet members to the Yoshida cabinet, and becoming Yoshida's ally party, so the Yoshida cabinet is also known as the Second Shidehara Cabinet. It can be said that the main body of the political parties supporting the Yoshida cabinet is actually the Progressive Party, not the Liberal Party, because the Yoshida cabinet is essentially a bureaucratic cabinet, not a political party cabinet. In the era of militarism, Japan welcomed the military cliques and allowed them to run rampant, which was exactly what these politicians, the predecessors of the Progressive Party, did. Historical facts clearly show us that when the September 18th Incident occurred, Shidehara was the Foreign Minister in the Minseito cabinet at the time. One year before the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, that is, in 1935, the Nakajima and Kuhara factions of the Minseito and the Seiyukai were willing to dissolve their own political parties and participate in the fascist system of the military and the bureaucracy. During the Hirota cabinet, these politicians colluded with bureaucrats and agreed to allow active military personnel to serve as ministers. During the Konoe cabinet's New System political movement, these politicians applauded and praised the military's dictatorial politics in the Diet, and all participated in the plan to invade China.</p>
<p>The Secretary-General of the Liberal Party, Wataru Hashimoto, made a fortune during the war by running the Peiping Hotel in Peiping. It is said that most of the Liberal Party's funds were provided by him. Ichiro Hatoyama, the former president of the Liberal Party, suppressed speech during his tenure as the Minister of Education in 1933, and dismissed Takigawa Yukitoki, a professor at Kyoto Imperial University who opposed military training. There is no disparity between the social groups represented by the Liberal and Progressive parties and the policies they advocate. They all lie in the protection of the national polity; in other words, they maintain and uphold the interests of established forces, and when the Yoshida cabinet was established, it owed a lot to Shidehara. Yoshida's cabinet formation staff was served by Shidehara's confidant, former State Minister Ishiguro Takeshige. The cabinet includes Kawai Yoshinari (Minister of Health), Shidehara Kijuro (State Minister), Saito Takao (State Minister), and Ichimatsu Sadayoshi (Minister of Communications) from the Progressive Party. The emergence of the Yoshida cabinet can be said to be the result of black market transactions between the Liberal and Progressive parties. The social groups represented by the Yoshida cabinet are exactly the same as those represented by the Progressive Party, still backed by senior ministers, bureaucrats, and the privy council. The central figures of the bureaucratic forces include Izawa Takio, Matsudaira Tsuneo, Suzuki Kantaro, Okada Keisuke, Yonai Mitsumasa, Mitsuchi Chuzo, Wakatsuki Reijiro, Ikeda Seihin, and his father-in-law Makino Nobuaki. Although they are of the Tojo faction, they were still speculators during the war.</p>

<h3>Another Woman Murdered in Nanshi: Found in Front of the Shanghai Garrison Railway Station; Circumstances Resembling the Xin Xian Lane Tragedy of Two Weeks Ago; Speculation Suggests Rape and Murder; Police Bureau Offers Reward for Strict Investigation</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper's Report] On the 24th of last month, a case of a murdered female corpse occurred in Xin Xian Lane in Nanshi, which remains unsolved. Unexpectedly, before many days had passed, another similar tragedy occurred yesterday. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Yesterday morning at approximately 7:00 AM, a woman was discovered murdered on the road in front of the Shanghai Garrison Railway Station in Nanshi, specifically on the wasteland where the old South District Fire Brigade used to be. The woman's body was lying face up on the lawn. Upon hearing the news, crowds rushed to the scene to observe. After being discovered by Police Officer Song Jinchao of the Shanghai Garrison Police Station, he immediately reported the situation to the Penglai Police Bureau. Yao Qihong, the head of the branch bureau, personally led Criminal Section Chief Yao Yuanlong, along with section members Wu Zhipeng, Police Chief Zhang Shusheng, and Tong Borong, to rush to the scene for investigation. The murdered woman appeared to be only 24 or 25 years old, of ordinary appearance, with her head pointing east and her feet west. Most of her face was found to be bluish-purple, her short hair was disheveled, and white foam was coming from her mouth. She was wearing a checkered qipao made of floral foreign cloth, with a white silk undershirt underneath, red striped short pants made of foreign cloth, and flesh-colored silk stockings. Her face was covered with mud stains, and one of her leather shoes was missing. The other leather shoe was found thrown near a telephone pole about thirty yards away from the body, with the words "Dechanglong Shoe Store" branded inside. Around the corpse's neck was a small blue handkerchief, and outside of that was a black and white polka-dotted net-like kerchief used for carrying things. After a long examination by the police officers, a ring mark was found on the ring finger of her left hand, but the ring was missing. Two buttons on the qipao were unbuttoned, the white undershirt was pulled up, and her breasts were exposed. There were signs of kicking injuries on both sides of her genitals. Next to the corpse was a mud pit three or four inches deep. According to general speculation, she was likely raped before being murdered. The method of murder was probably to forcefully press the woman's face into the mud, suffocating her, and then deliberately tying a handkerchief around the deceased's neck. It can also be concluded that the ring the deceased was wearing was robbed by the murderer afterward. Based on the above examination and judgment, this case undoubtedly involves prior rape, followed by murder, and then robbery of property. However, since the deceased did not have a National Identity Card with her, her name and address could not be ascertained. As of last night, no family members had come to the police station to claim the body. After receiving the report, the General Bureau immediately dispatched personnel from the Criminal Police Division to take photographs and fingerprint the deceased for family identification. In the afternoon, the body was transported to the Tongren Fuyuan Hall, and the court will be requested to conduct an examination this morning. After Branch Bureau Chief Yao Qihong returned to the bureau, due to the continuous occurrence of two bizarre female corpse cases in the jurisdiction within the past two weeks, he summoned the police officers of the Criminal Section and strictly instructed them to investigate the cases and set a deadline for solving them. He also offered a substantial reward to encourage the purchase of clues, so as to bring the murderer to justice for investigation.</p>
<h3>Substitute Senators Organize an Anti-Traitor Association: Will Host Reporters Today to Make a Statement</h3>
<p>In recent days, there have been widespread rumors that the Substitute Senators Liaison Association has reported eleven senators on suspicion of being traitors. However, to date, the person in charge of the association, Mr. Wei Yunong, has still stated that the association has never proactively conducted reporting work in the name of the organization in the past. However, the association has recently decided to organize an Anti-Traitor Committee to assist citizens in carrying out anti-traitor work. As for reporting several city senators suspected of being traitors, it is only one part of the committee's work.</p>
<p>Also, it is reported that the Substitute Senators Liaison Association is scheduled to host the press of this city at the New Life Club at 2:00 PM this afternoon to make a statement.</p>
<h3>Memorial Service for He Bingsong: Attended by More Than Five Hundred People from All Walks of Life</h3>
<p>The memorial service for the late He Bingsong, president of National Jinan University, was held yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM at the Zhonghua Xueyi Society on Shaoxing Road. More than five hundred prominent figures from all walks of life attended. A portrait of Mr. He was hung in the center of the altar, with many elegiac couplets hanging beside it. The elegiac couplet from Minister Chen Lifu read, "Trace the origins back to Lize, rise up and revitalize the dying cause of Beishan; diligently write until twilight years, suddenly return to Tusita, losing this scholar." Innumerable elegiac banners and couplets covered the four walls.</p>
<h3>Managing Jinan University Was Hard Work</h3>
<p>The memorial service was chaired by a presidium consisting of Pan Gongzhan, Li Zhaoshi, Jiang Zhuzhuang, Ou Yuanhuai, Liu Baimin, Du Zuozhou, Zhang Yi, Zai Zhuyi, Zhou Changshou, and others. After Pan led the memorial ceremony, he delivered a speech on the spot, praising He's lifelong spirit of engaging in education and cultural work, as well as his contributions to the education and academic circles in our country. He also praised the value of the Chinese Indigenous Culture Declaration published by He and other ten professors in the history of Chinese culture. Subsequently, Du Zuozhou reported on He's life deeds, and Xu Bingkun gave a lecture. Then, Wang Zhuyi, a representative of the Shanghai Alumni Association of Jinan University, delivered a speech, expressing infinite admiration for He's extreme hard work in managing the affairs of Jinan University for eleven years. He also paid the utmost respect for He's planning of Jinan University's relocation to the interior during the War of Resistance to avoid being controlled by the enemy and puppets, and to continue singing in Fujian. He also hoped that the students of Jinan University would diligently follow He's instructions during his lifetime to comfort his spirit. Then, students from Jinan University and teachers and students from the Cultural Middle School offered public sacrifices. Finally, He De Kui, He's nephew, delivered a thank-you speech on behalf of the family, and the service ended at 4:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Police Dog Training Completed: Assist in Inspecting Drug Dealers</h3>
<p>The City Police Bureau, recognizing that there are still many drug traffickers and that they often use ingenious methods to evade the eyes and ears of inspectors, established a police dog training class with eighty German Shepherds received from the enemy and puppets, and hired experts to complete the training. The trained police dogs have particularly sensitive senses of smell, and even if drug traffickers use cunning methods, it will be difficult for them to escape the police dogs' sense of smell. The City Police Bureau has now distributed the dogs to twenty-eight branch bureaus, and they will immediately accompany the police bureau's inspectors to conduct inspections at various transportation hubs.</p>
<h3>Outdoor Exposed Colored Lights Are Also Prohibited</h3>
<p>Since the prohibition of outdoor neon lights, general merchants have replaced them with sunlight-colored lights, which consume even more electricity than neon lights, greatly violating the principle of saving electricity. According to Director Zhao of the Public Works Bureau, since outdoor neon lights are prohibited, all outdoor decorative lights are also prohibited. If there is any deliberate violation, the same measures will be taken as for those who install outdoor neon lights.</p>
<h3>Ship Oil Pipes Stolen: Two Thieves Arrested</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper's Report] The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Yongfu Steamboat and Oil Tanker No. 104 were both docked at the Laobaitu Wharf. At 2:00 PM on the 5th, the Oil Tanker No. 104 was suddenly stolen of an oil pipe by "water rats" in the Huangpu River. On the night of the 9th, the Yongfu Steamboat was also stolen of eight oil pipes at night. The total value of the two incidents was over 10 million yuan. The incidents were reported to the Maritime Police Bureau for investigation. Director Wu immediately ordered Section Chief Sun Fang and Police Chief Tang Wanjin, among others, to investigate. It was learned that the oil pipes were sold to a second-hand shop near the Old North Gate and two places in Gujialong on Beijing Road. Subsequently, the receiver of stolen goods, Qian Si, was arrested and taken to the bureau for interrogation. Based on his confession, two accomplices, Xu Guiting and Xu Zhengzi, were also arrested. It was also revealed that the thieves were hiding in Pudong, Nanshi. Police went to those addresses and arrested Liu Xiaowuzi and Jiang Asan, both from Jiangbei. The masterminds, Wang Huailiang and Zhou, are still at large and are currently being strictly pursued.</p>
<h3>White Powder King Arrested: Large Quantities of Morphine Confiscated</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper's Report] The Zhongzheng West Road Police Station of the Changning Road Police Bureau arrested drug dealer Shen Yingbin (47 years old, from Baoding, Hebei, nicknamed "White Powder King") at No. 19 Xibin, Jiangsu Road, at 1:00 AM yesterday morning, and confiscated more than ten packets of morphine. Due to the complexity of the case, he will be transferred to the branch bureau this morning for handling.</p>
<h3>All High-Type Public Buses to Be Completely Overhauled</h3>
<p>The Public Works Bureau believes that the high-type public buses with doors at the rear, which operate on routes 4 and 5, need to be improved and renovated, such as: (1) The body is heavy and cumbersome, and the ride is bumpy. (2) The doors are at the rear, which is not only inconvenient for passengers to get on and off, but also prevents the driver from responding. (3) The roof leaks. It is reported that the bureau has decided to improve the above points. Of the thirty-eight trucks purchased by the Bureau of Materials Supply, ten have been renovated and are running on Route 7. The remaining twenty-eight will be completed in the shortest possible time and first transferred to Routes 4 and 5 for replacement. At the same time, all high-type vehicles will be completely overhauled.</p>

<h3>The Number of Military Personnel Riding Without Tickets on Both Railways is Increasing Daily: Revised Regulations; Strictly Prohibit Forcibly Occupying Seats; Officially Implemented Starting Today</h3>
<p>According to news from the two railway bureaus, the number of military personnel riding without tickets has been increasing daily recently. Although measures for military personnel riding for free have been drafted, and the train schedules for military personnel riding without tickets have been stipulated, there are still some military personnel who do not comply with the regulations and ride the trains, and even forcibly occupy seats on designated trains such as the Triumph and Taihu trains on the Beijing-Shanghai line and the Jinling and West Lake trains on the Shanghai-Hangzhou line. As a result, disputes occur from time to time, which greatly affects traffic order and passenger safety, resulting in delays and cancellations of trains, which are heard of daily. According to recent statistics, there are an average of about 4,500 military personnel riding without tickets on the Beijing-Shanghai line every day, and up to 5,500 on the busiest days. There are about 700 military personnel riding without tickets on the Shanghai-Hangzhou line every day, and up to 1,600 on the busiest days, accounting for one-tenth of the total number of passengers on both railways, which greatly affects the railway bureau's revenue. This figure does not include military personnel riding without tickets in accordance with the regulations. When General Tang Enbo, Commander-in-Chief of the Army, came to Shanghai a few days ago, the person in charge of the bureau went to see him and reported the situation in detail. General Tang promised to take measures to ban this practice. In order to facilitate military personnel riding without tickets, the bureau has simplified the procedures for riding and revised the train schedules for riding to: Trains 51 to 54 and 57 and 58 on the Beijing-Shanghai line, and trains 41, 42, 61, 62, 67, and 68 on the Shanghai-Hangzhou line, which are marked with "Military Personnel Seating Cars," allow active-duty military personnel to ride for free with their leave permits endorsed by the station military police. In addition, military personnel are specially allowed to purchase "half-price military tickets" with type A train passes or leave permits on trains 5 to 12 (except for sleepers) and 73 to 80 on the Beijing-Shanghai line, and trains 23, 25, 26, 92, and 94 on the Shanghai-Hangzhou line. Military personnel are absolutely prohibited from occupying seats without tickets on all trains other than the above-mentioned trains. The above measures will be officially implemented starting today.</p>
<h3>The Public Works Bureau's Two Transportation Agencies Will Hold Joint Weekly Meetings and Change Their Names</h3>
<p>Since the establishment of the Public Works Bureau's Tram Company Preparatory Office, it has actively carried out investigation and statistical work. Now, in order to meet the needs, seek closer contact with the routes operated by public buses, and simplify matters, the above agencies will be merged with the Public Bus Preparatory Committee and renamed the Shanghai Public Transportation Company Preparatory Committee. This decision has been approved at the Public Works Bureau's weekly meeting last week, and it will be implemented as soon as Mayor Wu approves it. It is also learned that Director Zhao Zengyu of the bureau will serve as the chairman of the committee, with Zhang Mingtao as his deputy.</p>
<h3>Amidst the Influx of American Films, "China Electric" Strives to Revitalize: Two New Films to Be Completed Next Month</h3>
<p>The Central Film Studio's first feature film after the victory, "The House of Loyalty," directed by Wu Yonggang and starring Liu Qiong and Qin Yi, played to full houses at the Shanghai Grand Theater for a month. At a time when foreign films are flooding our country's market, it is undoubtedly a great encouragement to domestic films. Luo Xuelian, the person in charge of the studio, is actively planning to order all film studios to speed up film production. Here is a report on the recent situation of each studio: The "China Electric" First Studio, located on Tiantong'an Road in Shanghai, is headed by Qiu Yiwei as the factory director and mainly focuses on the production of newsreels and documentaries. The studio has the best technical equipment, and Tang Huang is dedicated to the editing of newsreels and documentaries, producing about six newsreels and documentaries every month. Completed documentaries include "Agriculture is the Foundation of the Country," "Lively Early Summer," "The True Face of Mount Lu," "The Portrait of Chairman Chiang," "Fledgling Eagles," and "North and South of the Tianshan Mountains." The numbered newsreels have already been released from No. 120 to No. 149. Among them, the special newsreels such as "Japanese Surrender Ceremony," "Chairman Chiang Returns to Nanjing," "Trial of Traitor Chen Gongbo," "Trial of Chen Bijun and Chu Minyi," "Triumphant Return to the Capital," and "The Hunan Disaster" are the most historically valuable. The "Shanghai Window" is specially included in the general numbered newsreels, using the activities of Shanghai as materials, with various aspects. Recently, there are also plans to mix and edit newsreels and documentaries into magazine films, including "Modern Life" and "European and American Styles." The studio is also increasing equipment and shooting feature-length films. Factory Director Qiu Yiwei and Director Tang Huang are actively promoting this. It is expected that two to three feature films will be completed within half a year. The "China Electric" Second Studio is located on Jianguo West Road in Shanghai, headed by Xu Suling as the factory director. In addition to "The House of Loyalty," which has already been released, the new films "Distant Love" (directed by Chen Liting, starring Zhao Dan and Qin Yi) and "Flying to the World" (directed by Fang Peilin, starring Ouyang Feiying) can all be completed by the end of next month.

<h3>Desolate, Lonely, and Miserable: The "New Shanghai" After the Calamity; The Dream of Construction of That Year Shattered; Hope Everyone Works Hard to Piece It Together Again</h3>
<p>[Special Feature from This Newspaper] Building a new Shanghai has always been a beautiful dream. When the shadow of the dream had just begun to materialize on the ground, the enemy's artillery fire shattered it. Yesterday afternoon, the autumn light was just right, and reporters and others drove to find this shattered dream, but the scenery was no longer the same, and the former glory could not be pieced together no matter what.</p>
<p>An American soldier sat alone on the lawn behind the "Shanghai Special Municipality Government" building, staring blankly at the carvings under the eaves, as if lost in thought. A little further on, several of our brothers were watching this foreign comrade with interest and surprise. They lived in this building, which was damaged inside and had broken glass windows. They didn't understand what was so good about it.</p>
<p>When the reporter approached the American soldier, he turned his head and greeted, saying "It's beautiful!" He was originally a researcher of interior decoration and had a deep love for these purely Eastern patterns. But he mistakenly thought that the former municipal government building was a temple. After the reporter told him, he asked, "Why don't you repair such a beautiful building?" The reporter said, "That would take a lot of money." But the reporter also doubted whether people were still in the mood to piece together this shattered dream today, when the concessions had been recovered.</p>
<p>The Municipal Museum was a major achievement of the municipal government's cultural construction in the past. After its establishment, it was widely collected, attempting to preserve the traces of human activity here. What is left today is only the traces of destruction. Not only was it damaged by the enemy, but it also had the ominous traces left by our own people. Since the victory, it has been taken over many times, and some troops cut down trees indoors because of a lack of firewood. In the past, people cut down trees to build houses, but today everyone cuts down houses to make fires. Is this how times are progressing?</p>
<p>Now, the officers and soldiers of the 7th Company of the Lunqi Second Regiment live downstairs here. Although they tried their best to repair it, they could not repair it due to limited funds. The upstairs is all empty, deserted, and silent, as if stepping into a haunted house in a detective novel. In the misery, it seemed that there was a sound of crying from the corners of the roof pillars.</p>
<p>The gymnasium has been sealed off. Light and heavy explosives are stored inside. The doors on all four sides are either blocked by barbed wire or guarded by guards.</p>
<p>But the Municipal Hospital is actively operating. Now it is the Shanghai Army Hospital and Military Medical School of the Ministry of Military and Political Affairs. The enemy's army hospital was also here in the past, and they added many houses and equipment. After we took over, we improved it. At the same time, there are many new plans being actively implemented!</p>
<p>As for the beautiful residences of the new Shanghai in the past, they can no longer be seen. Most of the few remaining small foreign-style houses are also damaged with broken doors and windows.</p>
<p>The dream of building a new Shanghai in the past is completely shattered! But I hope everyone will work hard again and piece it together again.</p>

<h3>Yang Wendao: Ten Years of Wrongful Imprisonment Rectified; Relatives and Friends Celebrate Together</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper's Report] At 7:00 AM yesterday, after Yang Wendao's ten-year wrongful imprisonment was declared innocent by the High Court in court the day before yesterday afternoon, Yang's relatives and friends all said that they were endlessly rejoicing that he had been wrongly accused for ten years and his grievance had been redressed one day. The members of the "Hongshun Mutual Aid Association" presided over by Yang took the name of "Members and Friends Joint Celebration Meeting" and held a grand "Celebration" meeting at the Hongguang Grand Theater on North Sichuan Road at 10:00 AM yesterday morning, and issued a special publication to commemorate it. In the special publication, unlimited respect was expressed for lawyers Tang Huaiqun and Rui Zhaoji for their legal protection, for the just words of the public opinion circles, upholding justice, and for Yu Zhijing's great benevolence and righteousness in providing bail. After the meeting, there were performance programs with profound implications. The meeting ended at about 12:00 noon.</p>
<h3>Forging Documents and Extorting: Repeated Offenses; Jiang Weilian and Another Accomplice Arrested Yesterday</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper's Report] Jiang Weikang (pictured), a native of Anhui, 40 years old, lives at No. 266, Jian'an Road, and is the accounting director of the Shen Ren Zhongxing Construction Export Bank. Recently, he and his colleague Hu Guanghan (24 years old, a native of Shanghai) forged documents, impersonated the name of the Shanghai Garrison Fourth Inspection Office of the Songhu Garrison Command, and specialized in extortion. The number of victims before and after is countless. The case was learned by the Penglai Road Branch of the Police Bureau and arrested him at the home of Peng Aqijia, No. 19, Deqing Lane, Lujiabang Road, Nanshi. At the beginning of this month, the two criminals went to Peng's home with a forged approval from the former commander Qian Dajun, saying that he was suspected of privately hiding enemy property and must be taken to the headquarters for investigation. Later, Peng's wife, Caiying, interceded and agreed that if he could pay 2 million yuan, he could be exempted from investigation. Finally, a settlement of 500,000 yuan was agreed upon, and Peng's wife paid it off in two installments. Unexpectedly, the two criminals went to Peng's house again the day before yesterday, saying that the superiors believed that the matter was of great importance and that Peng must personally write a letter to the headquarters. Peng's wife reported to the Penglai Police Bureau because the two criminals repeatedly caused trouble. The chief sent Director Yao Yuanlong, team members Wu Zhipeng, police chief Tong Borong, police officer Fang Gaoshan, Ye Guanbao and others to rush to capture them. Many forged documents were confiscated from the two criminals on the spot, as well as more than forty returned checks from Guanghua Bank, Hetai Bank, and Yuanxiang Money House. After being taken to the bureau for interrogation, they confessed that they had resorted to this strategy because their income was insufficient. After investigation by the police bureau, the victims who have been discovered include Wang Zhongyu and Le Mingsheng at No. 3, Tianlefang, Xieqiao Lane. The police bureau has applied for custody, and it is hoped that the victims will report to the bureau so that the case can be handled together.</p>
<h3>Tram Disregards Red Light: Crashes into Truck and Injures People</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper's Report] At 7:00 AM yesterday morning, a case of a British-owned No. 8 tram crashing into a truck occurred at the south end of the Waibaidu Bridge. In addition to the tram driver Guan Youli injuring both hands, passengers Guo Shuchun and conductor Shun Erren were seriously injured in the head. The truck that was hit was a No. 35032 cargo truck owned by Huaxing Company at No. 39, Zhongzheng East Road, fortunately without any major problems. The cause of the accident was that the driver of the tram did not pay attention to the red light ahead. After the accident, the police on duty urgently summoned an ambulance to send the injured to Renji and Gongji Hospitals for treatment.</p>
<h3>Two Sailing Boats on the Suzhou Creek: Four Boatmen and Others Kidnapped</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper's Report] A week ago, two sailing boats from northern Jiangsu, loaded with 150 bales of cotton, arrived in Shanghai and docked at Wharf No. 18 on the west side of the Sichuan Road Bridge on Suzhou Creek. One day, five or six people in uniforms arrived and, without asking the reason, took away the boatmen Lu Wenxiang, Shi Guoxiang, and the ship officers Huang Boqing and Xiao Huang, accusing them of having some kind of suspicion. Before leaving, they sent two people in plain clothes to stay on the ship to guard it, claiming that they were sent by a certain agency. Afterwards, the cargo owner inquired with a certain agency, and found that there was no such thing, nor was there any kidnapping of the four people. The truth of the case is being thoroughly investigated by the authorities.</p>

<p>Commendable Service Spirit of Railway Staff</p>
<p>Mr. Shen, an employee of a certain organization in this city, traveled with his wife to Changzhou on the Kuai Dong express train of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway on the 6th. After getting off the train, he remembered that he had forgotten a women's handbag worth more than 2 million yuan in the car, so he asked the Changzhou stationmaster Lu Henian to find it. Lu immediately telegraphed various stations to search for it. When the car passed through Zhenjiang Station, Stationmaster Ge of the station managed to find it and immediately returned it to the original owner. After checking, nothing was missing. The spirit of service is particularly commendable.</p>

<h3>Reply to Readers - Legal Questions</h3>
<p>(1) Old Love Rekindled</p>
<p>Yang Youwei asks: There are three people, A, B, and C. A is 23 years old, B is 19 years old, and C (female) is 30 years old. B and C cohabited two and a half years ago (without marriage, only B's parents tacitly acknowledged C as their son-in-law). Recently, because B was dissatisfied with C's temperament and often suffered abuse from C, she discussed countermeasures with A (A and B had been in love three years ago, separated for two and a half years, and rekindled their love half a year ago). They got engaged in March of this year and had two engagement papers (each holding one, but B, fearing trouble, stored hers with A). Twelve guests attended the ceremony, and two introducers and two witnesses signed or stamped the papers. Currently, C and B's family know about the situation between A and B (B's family is strongly opposed, but they don't know about the engagement), so the following questions arise. Please answer them:</p>
<p>(1) Has a marital relationship been established between B and C after two and a half years of cohabitation? (2) Can C sue A? (3) Does B's age allow her to have autonomy in marriage? (4) Can B's family sue A? (5) Is the engagement agreement between A and B legally valid? (6) What procedures should A and B follow to get married?</p>
<p>[Lawyer Fu Kuangling replies] (1) Since B and C have not formally married, they cannot establish a marital relationship. (2) Since C is not B's husband, he has no right to sue A. (3) B is not yet an adult (20 years old is considered adulthood), so both engagement and marriage should have the consent of her legal guardian. (4) If B has not left her family and gone with A, even if her family sues A, A has no criminal responsibility. (5) See answer to question 3 for details. (6) They should wait until B turns 20 years old and then hold the engagement and marriage ceremony. At that time, even if B's parents oppose or do not act as the officiant, it will not be an obstacle.</p>
<p>(2) Wanton Abuse</p>
<p>Yu Yongfen asks: A relative has a daughter who married last year. Unexpectedly, her husband is naturally unruly, and often abuses and scolds her for trivial matters. Daily life is like sitting on pins and needles. Although she has not suffered violent beatings, her mental suffering has reached its limit. Because it is difficult to grow old together, she returned to her mother's home. Her husband came to take her back, and after her father repeatedly warned him, her husband obediently listened and took her back. However, not long after, the old habits returned, and the abuse continued. Now there are several legal questions, please answer them: (1) Under these circumstances, it is difficult to cohabit. Can the woman file for divorce? (2) Can the woman request alimony? (4) If the man does not agree to a divorce, what should be done?</p>
<p>[Lawyer Fu Kuangling replies] (1) Since she has suffered unbearable pain in cohabitation, she can legally divorce. (2) She can request alimony. (3) If both parties cannot agree on a divorce, she can file a lawsuit for divorce in court.</p>

<h3>A Shanghai Transportation Trilogy: Brothel Runner Sitting in Official Sedan, Comparable to the Shanghai Daotai of the Time</h3>
<p>In the early days of the Shanghai concession, besides the single-wheeled "goat carts," the more prestigious mode of transportation was the sedan chair. Officialdom traveled exclusively by sedan chair, and the hierarchy was as strict as with mandarin squares and hat knobs. The Shanghai Daotai rode in a large, eight-bearer sedan chair with silk cloth and a golden top. A county magistrate could only use a four-bearer sedan chair with red lacquer, a vermillion top, and blue cloth. Gentry and scholars rode in sedan chairs with ornate tops and inlaid glass, called "sun-shielding sedan chairs." Commoners only rode in small sedan chairs with blue cloth, as did doctors and similar professions.</p>
<p>The bridal sedan chair, used for newly married brides, was the most flamboyant. Many families still use it for weddings today, calling it the "Ningbo colored sedan chair." At that time, flower sedan chairs came in red and green, and one color was chosen based on instructions from the Zhou Tang divination method. The bride sitting in this flower-bedecked sedan chair was full of joy, like a top scholar parading through the streets on horseback!</p>
<p>Convicts being escorted to the execution ground or sent to prison also sat in sedan chairs, a type of small, topless sedan chair. Prostitutes on official errands could ride in green cloth official sedan chairs. Many fast sedan chairs waited at docks and stations, soliciting customers. Sedan chairs were indeed the only mode of transportation at the time. Later, when rickshaws were introduced, the number of sedan chairs on the market gradually decreased. Perhaps the last person in Shanghai to ride in a sedan chair was Zhang Shengsheng, a famous expert in treating typhoid fever. The roads were already full of automobiles, but he still insisted on riding in his sedan chair. To this day, Zhang's descendants still hang this sedan chair in the gatehouse, truly comparable to Zhou Liantang's No. 1 automobile. Sedan chairs were eliminated due to the influence of rickshaws, but they were replaced by horse-drawn carriages. "Hat shadows and whip silks catch the evening sun, faint dust follows the light wheels of the horse-drawn carriage," perfectly representing its status as the "darling" of the time. Officials, foreigners, princes, ladies of the inner chambers, and courtesans all traveled by horse-drawn carriage, becoming a fashion of the time. Riding in a horse-drawn carriage, circling around, and visiting Zhang Garden was the most trendy activity. Even rich old men from the interior would first acquire a horse-drawn carriage.</p>
<h3>Double Horses Side by Side, Eight Hooves Flying; Modern Can Be Called a "Handsome"</h3>
<p>Horse-drawn carriages were all modeled after foreign styles, similar to the old mule carts. Carriages were either two-wheeled or four-wheeled, and horses were either single or double. Styles included sedan carriages, covered carriages, and various other types, even ones that were neither sedan nor covered, with an iron pole erected behind the carriage and a canopy attached. The equipment inside the carriage was also very elaborate. Green cloth curtains, white copper spittoons, shiny mirrors, flower vases with silk flowers, fox fur cushions in winter, and white copper hand warmers and foot warmers, filling the carriage with spring warmth despite the wind and snow. The coachman's attire was also specially made, with gauze in summer and a coolie hat, and leather clothing with a cape in winter. Followed by a handsome servant, double horses galloping side by side, eight hooves flying, the scene was full of splendor, flaunting through the city, and passersby would cast sidelong glances. Zheng Rucheng, the garrison commander of Shanghai, was assassinated while riding in a double-horse carriage to visit the consulate on the Waibaidu Bridge.</p>
<p>At that time, families of officials mostly loved to ride in sedan carriages; foreigners, nobles, and courtesans loved to ride in covered carriages, enjoying the freedom to roam and relax. In addition, there was a small horse-drawn carriage with rubber steel wire wheels called a "Handsome," which could be driven by oneself with the reins, riding a famous Arabian horse, which was considered the most modern and was only used by young masters for pleasure rides. Serious people rarely rode in them. During the peak of horse-drawn carriages, there were also carriage rental stables. "Longfei" Carriage was the first brand, located opposite the racetrack at the "International Theater" today. This building has a long and storied history.</p>
<h3>Foreigners' Arrogance: Unequal Treatment in Carriages</h3>
<p>At that time, there was also a regulation for driving horse-drawn carriages: all Chinese vehicles were not allowed to overtake foreigners, and foreign vehicles could overtake Chinese vehicles at will. This was also due to the concession authorities' discrimination against the Chinese, like the sign "Dogs and Chinese are not allowed" that used to hang at the entrance of the park. The wealthy Jewish merchant Hardoon had a horse-drawn carriage with red wheels, but at that time in England, only nobles with titles could use "vermilion wheels and ornate hubs." Commoners were prohibited from using them, let alone Hardoon, who was Jewish. Hardoon was fined a lot of money for this carriage. It is said that most of the mahogany-paved road on Nanjing Road was built with Hardoon's fines.</p>
<p>Looking back, how poetic it was to sit in a "Handsome" steel wire horse-drawn carriage in the fading sunset, the sound of hooves echoing, galloping along the edge of the racecourse. The "wheels of time" have eliminated horse-drawn carriages. In the municipal authority's report in 1937, only eight horses and eight carriages remained, filled with feelings of the past and present.</p>
<h3>Vehicle Statistics</h3>
<p>A. Motor Vehicles</p>
<p>(1) Privately Owned Cars: 4,819</p>
<p>(2) Commercial Cars: 609</p>
<p>(3) Privately Owned Trucks: 1,635</p>
<p>(4) Motorcycles: 5,601</p>
<p>(5) Test Cars: 131</p>
<p>(6) Military Vehicles: 4,957</p>
<p>B. Non-Motor Vehicles</p>
<p>(1) Commercial Tricycles: 9,715</p>
<p>(2) Privately Owned Tricycles: 5,146</p>
<p>(3) Bicycles: 98,154</p>

<p>(7) Pneumatic-Tired Trucks: 10,065</p>
<p>(8) Three-Wheeled Trucks: 4,629</p>
<p>(9) Horse-Drawn Carriages: 72</p>
<p>Dozens of horse-drawn carriages still remain in Shanghai today, but they no longer have the elegant scene of galloping around the racecourse in the setting sun. Now, they are just a few old, weak, and emaciated horses picking up and dropping off passengers in front of the North Railway Station to earn a little bit of hard-earned money.

<p>Doesn't this early Shanghai automobile look like a four-wheeled horse-drawn carriage?</p>
<h3>"Strange Howls and Roars While Driving, Randomly Emitting Black Smoke Along the Road"</h3>
<p>Automobiles first appeared in Shanghai in the late Qing Dynasty during the Guangxu era. At that time, two foreigners living in Shanghai happened to return to their home countries, learned to drive cars, and found it fresh and interesting. When they returned to China, they brought back two cars. Along the foreign Bund, cars began to drive on the streets, a novelty to behold.</p>
<p>The automobiles of that time had extremely rudimentary structures and very simple mechanisms. The car body was roughly similar to a horse-drawn carriage. The driver sat outside the car compartment, high up as if sitting on the second floor. When the car moved, dust flew. The driver wore work clothes and aviator goggles, taking the matter seriously. At that time, they adjusted the speed on the footboard, and when suddenly stopping, they often became flustered. As for breaking down on the road and being overtaken by horse-drawn carriages, it was not uncommon. Because riding in a car at that time was regarded as a novel game, similar to riding a yacht today, and not solely for transportation purposes.</p>
<p>At that time, the area west of the New World was entirely countryside, and the prosperous area was around the Mud City Bridge. The roads were also relatively wide. Citizens with nothing to do would stand by the roadside to admire the people in the cars. When they saw a "woo, woo, woo" car emitting black smoke drive past, they would shout loudly and clap their hands and laugh. The horse-drawn carriage class at that time could not help but feel a bit jealous of this vehicle that did not require horses. They submitted a joint petition to the Public Works Department to ban it for various reasons: "Strange howls and roars while driving, causing horses and carriages to jump in fright," "Randomly emitting black smoke along the road, hindering hygiene," "Often breaking down midway, obstructing traffic." However, the Public Works Department at that time hoped that there would be a few cars in the concession to embellish and enhance the city's appearance, so they did not act on the horse-drawn carriage class's request for a ban.</p>
<h3>Drivers Were Highly Sought After</h3>
<p>Later, as automobiles gradually increased, wealthy families, pursuing fashion, ordered them one after another from foreign countries, and car drivers became highly sought after. Many relatively young coachmen took this opportunity to learn to drive cars. However, the car brands were different, the styles were different, and the driving methods were also different. Car drivers knew one thing but not the other. It was not uncommon for people to buy cars but not know how to drive them, and therefore leave them in the storage of the Longfei car dealership for a year or six months. As for those who knew how to drive cars, regardless of their skills or character, the car owners would pay a considerable price to hire them. However, many wealthy people who bought cars at that time still kept horse-drawn carriages as a backup, showing that they did not fully trust cars.</p>
<h3>Hardoon's Wife Fined for Speeding</h3>
<p>Of the first two automobiles to arrive in Shanghai, one was acquired by the wealthy Jewish merchant Hardoon. Hardoon's wife, Luo Jialing, often rode it for fun. However, at that time, the roads were narrow and crowded, and the car drove like a snail, often knocking down pedestrians and bumping into things. The Public Works Department did not know what category to put this new "monster" in. After hesitating for a long time, they decided to levy taxes and issue licenses according to the horse-drawn carriage standards. However, there were no regulations for driving automobiles. Because Hardoon's wife's car caused too many accidents, they extended the measures for banning horse-drawn carriages to automobiles, strictly prohibiting speeding, with a fine of 500 yuan for violators. Hardoon's wife did not care. She carried banknotes with her and drove wildly on Nanjing Road. If a patrolman came forward to interfere, she would immediately pay the fine. The fines were endless, and the patrolmen slowly became indifferent.</p>
<h3>The First Car, the First License Plate</h3>
<p>Hardoon cherished this first automobile very much. To preserve the car's history, whenever it was damaged, he would replace the parts and never replace the car with a new one. Before Luo Jialing died, it could still be seen driving slowly through the city. After Hardoon had this first automobile in Shanghai, he hoped to get the first license plate. However, the first license plate had already been donated by Zhou Xiangyun, who was unwilling to show it easily. Therefore, the first car never went out, but he had more than one car, so he could just keep it in the garage. Hardoon once offered a high price to buy it, but Zhou refused. To this day, the first automobile and the first license plate are still stored separately in the garages of the two families in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Rental Car, 10 Silver Dollars from Haiyin</h3>
<p>When automobiles first appeared, only wealthy families could afford to ride in them. In 1916, a retired official and several companions established the Feilong Automobile Company at the former site of the municipal building on Nanjing Road, now the location of the Xinya Restaurant, specializing in rental business, providing rides for people to try, with a price of 10 silver dollars per hour, or a minimum of 6 yuan for half an hour. Although the price was relatively high, because it was a pioneering effort, curious people were happy to try it. This was the beginning of the rental car industry in Shanghai. When the First World War broke out, automobile manufacturing had made further progress. After the war ended, European and American automobile operators competed to open up markets in China. The number of automobiles in Shanghai suddenly increased. The rental car business gradually expanded, and buses were also in operation. Transportation in Shanghai became the domain of automobiles. Although during the occupation period, due to the interruption of gasoline supply, the number of automobiles in the city decreased. After the victory, many long-abandoned automobiles reappeared, coupled with military jeeps and large trucks, filling the roads. No one remembers the era of clattering carriages and neighing horses thirty years ago.</p>
<h3>A Casual Discussion on Rickshaws: As Early As 1874, French Introduced Eastern Product</h3>
<p>The rickshaw is a very common means of transportation today. From a scientific point of view, it is not only too backward, but also inhumane, but with public transportation so crowded today, rickshaws still have the possibility of existing.</p>
<p>The rickshaw is a product of Japan. It first arrived in Shanghai as early as 1874. A Frenchman named Mira imported this thing from Japan. With the approval of the French Concession Council, the first notice was issued on March 24. Mira then obtained permission from the French Concession Council and the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession to prepare 300 vehicles for business in the concession. This was the first scene of rickshaws in Shanghai. However, Mira did not get rich from running the rickshaw business for two years, but instead lost money. As a result, he fled to Vladivostok.</p>
<p>Because rickshaws came from Japan, they were initially called Eastern Cars. Later, the car bodies were all painted yellow, so they were also called Yellow Packet Cars. At first, the wheels were tall, similar to the rear wheels of horse-drawn carriages. The wheels were made of wood, surrounded by iron rings, making a rattling sound when moving, which was very loud. The car body was larger than what is seen now, and could seat two people, slightly like today's tricycles. Later, because there were cases of men and women engaging in improper behavior, the police strictly prohibited it for reasons related to morality, and reduced the size of the car body to only accommodate one person.</p>
<h3>Steel Wire Rubber Wheels Were Once Prohibited</h3>
<p>The use of steel wire rubber wheels in rickshaws was a major improvement. At that time, a company called Nitto Trading near Mud City Bridge invented steel wire to replace wooden wheels, and rubber tires were used instead of iron rings. The ride was less bumpy, which was considered very modern at the time. However, because the wheels were silent when walking, the rickshaw pullers often did not warn people first, which often led to collisions with pedestrians. Therefore, the Shanghai Municipal Council once prohibited it. The steel wire rubber wheels only became popular in 1914.</p>
<p>In the past when concessions existed, rickshaws were divided into large licenses and small licenses. A large license referred to a license from the Public Concession and also a license from the French Concession. If a Chinese license was also donated, it would be able to pass without obstruction, which was the most convenient. A small license only had a French Concession license and no Public Concession license, and could not be driven in the Public Concession. Because the scope of activity was small, the price was also cheaper. If there was only a Chinese license and no concession license, it was a third-rate car. This was the consistent style of the concession era, not just for rickshaws.</p>
<h3>Regardless of Wind, Frost, and Dew, Running East and West All Day Long</h3>
<p>Rickshaw pullers rely on their strength to do this work like cattle and horses, and their lives are the hardest. All day and night, in wind, frost, and dew, running east and west, selling sweat and blood to maintain their minimum living, they also suffered from layers of exploitation. The misery and pain were beyond description. In July 1934, under the leadership of the Shanghai Municipal Council, a rickshaw pullers' mutual aid association was established to handle the welfare of rickshaw pullers, which achieved some success.</p>
<p>When tram workers go on strike or when the roads are flooded, rickshaw pullers become the favored ones. They demand 2,000 to 3,000 yuan for a short distance. When the bustling city becomes a watery country and it is impossible to wade through, people have to rely on them, even if it is a little expensive, they have to endure it.</p>
<p>"Wild Chicken" chartered rickshaws were the first step in the development of rickshaws. The pullers of "Wild Chicken" chartered rickshaws were mostly rickshaw pullers who accumulated money from pulling soldiers, bought a half-new or old rickshaw, donated a license for a privately-used rickshaw, and could make their "Wild Chicken" business at the crossroads. These cars are newer, and passengers can pretend that they are their own, so the fare is more expensive. The pullers of "Wild Chicken" chartered rickshaws sometimes had the possibility of becoming the owners of rental rickshaws.</p>
<h3>Rickshaws Eliminated Under the Wheels of Time</h3>
<p>Rickshaws are considered inhumane and unscientific. The city has a plan to gradually eliminate rickshaws, and the Executive Yuan also has a motion to abolish rickshaws at the National Transportation Conference. However, as early as ten years ago, the Shanghai Municipal Council had implemented its preliminary measures, such as restricting rickshaw registration, reducing the issuance of rickshaw licenses, and organizing rickshaw puller registration. Later, during the war, the population in the concession suddenly increased, while public transportation was restricted, so not only did the number of rickshaws not decrease, but it increased significantly. Now that the old matter is being brought up again, it seems that the rickshaw that has been in use for more than 70 years will eventually be "sentenced to death," but how will the lives of these 50,000 to 60,000 rickshaw pullers be solved? There are also 300,000 people who indirectly rely on rickshaws for a living, which is even more difficult.</p>
<h3>Founding Record of Public Transportation</h3>
<p>Trams and buses, which once traveled in the city, are the only means of transportation for Shanghai citizens. Although passengers are so crowded and it takes a lot of time to wait for vehicles, the fares are low, and most citizens are unwilling to give up their rights. The history of trams and buses is not very long. Trams have been running for less than 40 years, and buses have only been around for 20 years.</p>
<p>Since Shanghai opened up, foreigners continued to arrive in Shanghai. By 1895, there were 4,684 foreigners in the concession north of the Yangjingbang, and 432 foreigners in the French Concession. For their own convenience, they felt it necessary to establish public transportation.</p>
<h3>Tram</h3>
<p>In July 1881, Jardine Matheson requested the French Concession Council to establish trams. On August 1, a meeting of taxpayers in the concession was convened to hear opinions on trams. As a result, out of 93 people, 53 people agreed, thus determining the principle of preparing to establish trams in the concession.</p>
<p>In 1895, an American named Hent proposed to build trams in the Public Concession of Yangjingbang, and asked the Shanghai Municipal Council to submit it to the Taxpayers' Association for review. Upon hearing the news, the Shanghai Water Company and the Shanghai Gas Company believed that the tram tracks used electric current, and if the layout was improper, it would corrode or damage the pipes buried under the road, so they sent a letter to the Shanghai Municipal Council, expressing their disagreement. Shortly after, Hent returned to the United States. Another person named Waste applied to the Shanghai Municipal Council, saying that if the Taxpayers' Association accepted Hent's proposal, he would be willing to invest 150,000 taels to build 2 kilometers of tracks and operate trams. However, Hent's original proposal had been rejected, so his proposal was silenced.</p>
<p>In 1897, a Belgian track construction company proposed to build trams in the concession. Later, a French company, Lyon Far East Industrial Construction Company, also submitted a construction request. At that time, the French Concession Council originally intended to jointly operate the tram business with the Public Concession, so the case was shelved.</p>
<h3>British Attempt to Patent, French Merchants Go Their Separate Ways</h3>
<p>On March 24, 1898, the Shanghai Municipal Council of the International Settlement and the Conseil d'Administration of the French Concession jointly formed a Tram Design Committee.  The International Settlement dispatched two directors, and the French Concession dispatched one director, who, together with the engineers from both administrations, composed the committee. At the time, the Shanghai Municipal Council advocated using a standard gauge of 1.44 meters, while the French Concession argued that the standard would be too expensive and that wages would be difficult to make affordable for the public. It would be better to use a width of one meter. As a result, the two sides went their separate ways. On October 4, 1899, the Shanghai Municipal Council and the Conseil d'Administration of the French Concession held another joint meeting to review the plans received from factories in various countries. Six factories submitted bids: (1) French firm Lixing Foreign Firm, (2) German firm United Electrical Company, (3) Belgian firm Track Construction Company, (4) French firm Lyon Industrial Construction Company, (5) American firm Shanghai Tram Company, and (6) British firm British Electrical Transportation Company. After review, the plan from the American firm Shanghai Tram Company was considered the best, and the conditions were the most suitable. The plan was then published in the North-China Daily News on October 7, and an electors' meeting was convened on October 17 in both concessions to solicit consent, but the meeting rejected the plan.</p>
<p>It is said that the reason for the rejection was that at that time, the majority of voters were British, and everyone hoped to reserve the patent for this business to the British. Therefore, the French Consul General told the Conseil d'Administration that since the International Settlement's electors' meeting had decided to reserve the tram business for the British, we should also study a plan for the French merchants to handle it as a countermeasure. As a result, French manufacturers engaged in extensive activities. Finally, in November 1905, the Belgian International Far East Company and the French Concession Electric Weekly established a preliminary agreement, and the contract was formally signed on January 24 of the following year. Thus, the French Concession Electric Military Company was born.</p>
<h3>Tram Birth in 1908</h3>
<p>Although the Shanghai Municipal Council's plan for trams was rejected, it continued to actively pursue it. In 1902, it re-tendered, and as a result, the plan of the White-Lu Electrical Engineering Company was approved. A contract was signed on May 14, 1903, stipulating that traffic should be opened within three years. However, due to the lack of wide-gauge tracks and the insufficient load capacity of narrow-gauge tracks, the plan was shelved. In 1905, with the consent of the Shanghai Municipal Council, the franchise was given to the Shanghai Tram Company.</p>
<p>After the authorities of the two concessions made their decisions, they proceeded to lay tracks and erect poles separately. The planned routes at that time for the International Settlement were three: (1) from Jing'an Temple to Hongkou Park, (2) from Jing'an Temple to the Bund, and (3) from Yangshupu to the Bund. The French Concession stipulated two routes: (1) from Xiaodongmen to Xujiahui, and (2) from Baochang Road to Xujiahui. In February 1908, the French Concession trams began operating, and a month later, the International Settlement trams also began operating. The tram, which many people had longed for, was finally realized.</p>
<h3>Passengers Safe and Sound, Business Thriving</h3>
<p>When the tram first started operating, the citizens found it very strange, so the Bund area was full of people watching the excitement every day. On both sides of the roads in the Yangjingbang area, people gesticulated and talked about the tram in the streets and alleys. In addition to Westerners, very few Chinese people rode the tram. This was because at that time, electricity was considered very dangerous, and people believed that if they had gold and silver in their pockets, they would be electrocuted. The public was confused by this absurd rumor and dared not try it out. Therefore, the words "Safe, Fast, and Cheap, the Public Can Ride" were written on the tram to attract customers. After a month, people found that passengers were safe and sound, and the business gradually began to thrive.</p>
<h3>In the Second Year of the Republic, Nantao Opens to Traffic, Trackless Trams Follow</h3>
<p>The Nantao trams, together with the International Settlement and French Concession trams, formed a tripod. However, its establishment was later than the concessions. After the concession trams were realized, foreigners had already paid attention to this and repeatedly requested the authorities, but they were not accepted. In the first year of the Republic (1912), Lu Jianhong, the manager of the Inland Electric Light Company, submitted a request to the municipal authorities to trial-run trams because the company had several storage engines that were very suitable for operating trams. After approval, he raised 200,000 yuan and ordered materials from abroad to begin construction. In the second year of the Republic (1913), the materials arrived in Shanghai, and the tracks were laid. After three months of work, a trial run was conducted in July, and official operation began on August 1. From then on, Nantao also had trams.</p>
<p>In 1914, the International Settlement began operating trackless trams, with two routes: (1) from North Henan Road and Laobazi Road to Minguo Road, and (2) from Zha Pu Road and Haining Road to Avenue Edward VII. The French Concession trackless trams began operating in 1926, with three routes: (1) from Jixiang Street to Jiangxi Road, (2) from Zhengjia Wooden Bridge to Fujian Road, and (3) from Mintiniyin Road to Xujiahui, making transportation more convenient. There was once a rumor that trackless trams would replace trams, but this never happened. However, the newly added routes in recent years have all been trackless.</p>
<h3>Public Buses Emerge in Response to the Times</h3>
<p>The operation of public buses began in 1924, but as early as when trams were being established, some people advocated operating public buses, believing that buses did not need to lay tracks and set up lines, making the project simpler and the cost lower. As a result, the Shanghai Municipal Council had already decided to start a tram project, and the proposal for public buses was shelved.</p>
<p>In 1920, British citizen Tong Hansheng organized the China Motor Company, planning to operate public buses within the International Settlement. The route would run from the Bund, along Avenue Edward VII, through Xizang Road, Haining Road, to Wusong Road. A special contract was signed with the Shanghai Municipal Council, allowing the company to operate, but due to financial reasons, it was not realized. In 1921, Tong Hansheng brought up the old matter again, planning a route from Jing'an Temple, along Yu Garden Road, to Zhaofeng Garden. After negotiations with the Shanghai Municipal Council, two 30-person buses were started. However, because the expenses were much higher than expected, and the income and expenses could not be offset, the operation was soon suspended.</p>
<h3>Giant Buses Appear in 1924</h3>
<p>At this time, Arnold and Frantrick were also drafting a public bus plan. After the China Motor Company closed, Frantrick, in his capacity as a representative, requested the Shanghai Municipal Council to operate public buses within the International Settlement. In January 1923, he obtained a patent. In August, he raised one million taels of capital and formally established the China Public Bus Company. He began to build factories, order vehicles, and actively prepare. After discussions with the Shanghai Municipal Council, ten routes were decided. The first route ran from the Bund, along Avenue Edward VII, Avenue Foch, Hart Road, to Jing'an Temple, and began operating in October 1924 with six buses. The first giant public bus in Shanghai appeared. Its appearance was far more modern than the outdated trams. Everyone sat on leather cushions, secretly rejoicing that the common people also had buses that the public could ride. It is said that the structure of the yellow public buses was based on the suggestion of the technical expert Selick, using the Stephenson standard chassis to reduce the friction between the tires and the road surface, making the ride smooth, the management easy, and the passengers safe and comfortable. It was indeed the result of a thorough study. In 1929, the Shanghai Municipal Council revised the temporary contract of the China Public Bus Company and concluded a formal special business agreement. The company paid the Shanghai Municipal Council a road usage fee and completely monopolized the public bus business of the International Settlement.</p>
<p>After obtaining the patent for the International Settlement, the Public Bus Company worked hard to expand its business and expand its routes, successively opening fifteen routes, with a total length of more than seventy miles. At its peak, it had a total of 174 various types of buses, built sheds, established assembly and repair factories, and employed 420 drivers, 587 ticket sellers, 92 ticket inspectors, 133 mechanics, and 150 miscellaneous workers. In addition, there were also temporary workers. It was a huge organization. The daily number of passengers reached a peak of 250,000 in 1938.</p>
<p>Everyone "struggled" to get on the tram, resulting in a chaotic order. The ticket sellers inevitably uttered many unpleasant complaints, and many disputes often occurred. In fact, if everyone kept order and lined up to get on the bus, what a good thing that would be!</p>

<h3>Express Buses Added in 1929</h3>
<p>When public buses first started operating, there was only one type of giant vehicle, with fixed schedules. In 1929, express buses were added, operating during office hours. Except for the starting and ending points, they did not stop along the way. In 1934, due to crowded passengers, double-decker buses were introduced, creating a new record in the history of Shanghai transportation. In 1937, streamlined buses were added, which were even more novel. After the January 28th Incident, the supply of gasoline was cut off, and the public buses stopped operating. After four years of enemy and puppet destruction, the whereabouts of these vehicles are unknown. Most of them were taken away by the Japanese, leaving only some damaged vehicles that could not be repaired. Now the Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities has set a deadline of November for them to resume operations, otherwise it will revoke their patent rights. What plans do the managers of the Public Bus Company have?</p>
<p>The public buses of the French Concession were an affiliated business of the tram company. In 1925, the tram company and the Conseil d'Administration of the French Concession signed a contract to operate trackless trams and public buses, stipulating that two public bus routes should be opened within six months after the trackless trams began operating. In February 1927, the French Concession also had public buses.</p>
<h3>Chinese Merchants' Buses Repeatedly Suffer War</h3>
<p>The public buses in the Chinese area were operated by the Chinese Merchants Public Bus Company. The Chinese Merchants Public Bus Company signed a contract with the municipal government in April of the seventeenth year (1928) and obtained a patent. In November, it first opened to traffic in Zhabei. During the January 28th Incident, the losses were extremely heavy. After the municipal government moved to the city center, it expanded its routes again, so it was unable to take care of both the Nantao and Pudong areas and voluntarily gave them up. The original Hunan Public Bus Company in Nantao operated buses, but due to poor management, it declared bankruptcy in the twentieth year (1931). It was then operated by the Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities. When the War of Resistance broke out and Shanghai fell, it also stopped operating.</p>

<h3>Causes and Consequences of the Yarn Allocation Organization, Past Shortcomings, Internal Difficulties, Preconditions for Implementing Control</h3>
<p>Yarn Allocation Mechanism</p>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] Since Mayor Wu expressed his intention to strengthen control over the joint yarn allocation by yarn factories last Friday, all parties have been anticipating how the future will develop. It has been learned that since private yarn factories began joint allocation on August 30, the results have been less than satisfactory for a month and a half, and have been criticized by all parties. In particular, the inquiry by Legislator Sun Jiulu and others of the Legislative Yuan on the 4th of this month left the economic authorities unable to justify themselves. Therefore, Mayor Wu's concurrent appointment as the director of the management committee to strengthen control is a new measure. According to sources familiar with the matter, this move has been brewing for a long time and is not a sudden measure. It is said that the government's original intention was to place the production of all yarn factories under the control of the Textile Construction, and the joint organization would naturally have considerable power.</p>
<p>Initial Accommodation</p>
<p>Later, in order not to be too hasty, and because the yarn factory industry expressed its willingness to assist the government's price stabilization policy with the spirit of self-governance, considerable accommodation was made during implementation. According to the method, purchasers must negotiate prices with the various yarn factory textile industry associations under the supervision of the Textile Management Committee and publicly announce the allocation quantity. According to this method, in addition to participating in price negotiations, the Textile Management Committee did not delve into the actual distribution situation. Therefore, every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday when yarn was opened, the Textile Construction and the yarn factory industry still went their separate ways. It is not without reason that powerful figures in the replica industry pointed out that the joint allocation had not been implemented.</p>
<p>Joint Allocation Fails</p>
<p>However, in the initial few periods, the listing price could barely be maintained. Later, as the black market rose daily, the actual allocation situation of yarn factories became increasingly blurred. Cotton product replica industries, which were initially dissatisfied with Textile Construction, felt that although Textile Construction had less goods, the degree of openness was far better than that of private yarn factories. Moreover, users of yarn who had dealings with yarn factories in the past found it more difficult to purchase than before the joint allocation. Yarn firms repeatedly expressed their disappointment, unable to benefit, while the circulation of black market yarn became increasingly prevalent. People both inside and outside the industry became suspicious, and yarn factories became the target of public criticism. According to disclosures from the yarn factory industry, they also seem to have their difficulties.</p>
<p>Yarn Factory Difficulties</p>
<p>For example, 26 yarn factories in this city have joined the joint allocation, while small factories and large factories outside the urban area have not participated. Since equal allocation has a sacrificial nature, why favor them over us? This is one. Since the beginning of the exchange rate change on August 19, the authorities have clearly stated that the flowers used by the factories have been provided by the government and settled at the old exchange rate, so the source of raw materials has not increased in price, and the price of yarn should not increase either. However, a small number of large factories have not yet settled their drafts and are requesting settlement at the old exchange rate, but they have never been approved. This is two. When the black market exceeds 2 million (20 counts), the allocated price is limited to 1.55 million. Textile Construction sells one-third of the yarn, and commercial factories sell two-thirds of the yarn. Yarn factories believe that the sacrifice is too heavy. This is three. Yarn factories have made many allocations, and there must be some sacrifice, but the black market is soaring, and the people are not benefiting. Those who take advantage of the opportunity to resell and make a fortune. This is four. For these reasons, suspicions and anger are mixed, and the government has not made any improvements. Therefore, some colleagues have made angry remarks, saying that since yarn factories cannot make money, they can stop working and return their capital. If the government can sacrifice, then they can let the government advance funds to start work. The situation has become increasingly profound, and there has been a change in the management organization in the near future.</p>
<p>Consequences are Worrying</p>
<p>According to insiders, the yarn produced by private yarn factories will be completely placed under the management of Textile Construction, and will be handled in the same way as the yarn sold by Textile Construction. The price limit may be slightly increased, and the black market will not be openly unscrupulous. The government will also strengthen control over yarn users. The final stage may be to control the cloth shops. However, as control in this city becomes stronger, the production of yarn and cloth may decrease, and the market outside the control line will become more lively, and its market price will also rise. Therefore, from the perspective of the overall society, whether it is beneficial or harmful is worth studying. It is said that an authority in the cotton product replica industry once told a gentleman from the Textile Management Committee to seriously consider it and not be too hasty, lest it be counterproductive and cause a panic of materials. The gentleman was also very moved, but said that the yarn factories are unwilling to sincerely cooperate with the government, and the government also has no choice. Therefore, although control must be strengthened, the consequences are worth noting.</p>
<p>Final Decision</p>
<p>The director of the Textile Business Management Committee was originally Mr. Shu Yunzhang. This gentleman is a veteran of the textile industry. President Song relied heavily on him, and he himself came from the business world and knew more about the actual hardships. This time, he resigned, reportedly at his strong request, in order to relieve himself of responsibility. Now the director is held concurrently by Mayor Wu, while Mr. Shu remains a member. In addition to General Manager Shu, Textile Construction also has two deputy managers, one is Mr. Wu Weijing and the other is Mr. Li Shengbo. Wu was originally a member, and Li has also been appointed as a member this time. Observers believe that the center of gravity of the organization is still in Textile Construction. Mr. Shu is probably still the only powerful figure with decision-making power. Mayor Wu will use his political power to strengthen the implementation of this decision.</p>
<p>Scholarly Opinions</p>
<p>Economists generally express dissatisfaction with the rise in yarn and cloth prices, and also believe that it is difficult to enforce the strengthening of control. A well-informed person said that economic matters still need to be handled with economic policies. Control must have a comprehensive plan and complete statistical materials before it can be effective. Now that implementation is limited to this city, it may promote the escape of materials. Statistics are biased to one area and cannot be used for comprehensive regulation. In the end, it is not as good as hard-line supplements of rice and grain, and the black market is still difficult to succumb. The yarn and cloth industry has suffered enough blows during the enemy and puppet period and is weak. Yarn factories are encountering opportunities and have considerable surpluses. They should be guided well and not allowed to escape capital and production to decline. The yarn factory industry should also know when to stop, and disclose the content of its allocation to share with the society.</p>
<h3>Money Exchange Industry Greatly Affected After Setting Purchase and Sale Prices for US Dollars, Association Requests Restoration of Free Transactions</h3>
<p>Since the Central Bank stipulated the legal purchase and sale prices for US dollars for various money exchange firms in this city, the market has cooled down, and there are few transactions in money shops all day long. It has been learned that the Shanghai Money Exchange Industry Association has submitted a report to the authorities requesting permission to restore free transactions as before seven days, otherwise, not only will the industry suffer significant losses, but it is feared that it will be completely contrary to the government's original intention of control. It is said that the authorities have not yet responded to whether or not they will accept it.</p>
<h3>Cotton Prices to Rise, Egyptian Cotton Farmers Predict</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Alexandria, 12th] Egyptian cotton growers are unwilling to sell the new cotton because they believe that cotton prices will rise sharply after the end of the peace conference, when business in Europe will begin and the need for Egyptian cotton will inevitably increase.</p>
<h3>Opening Ceremony of the National Goods Exhibition Mall to be Held Tomorrow</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Branch of the China Production Promotion Association, in order to promote national goods and rebuild the national psychology of loving national goods, and to save the crisis of China's industry and commerce, has specially built a site at No. 444 Nanjing Road (next to the Xianle Dance Palace) to host the Shanghai National Goods Exhibition and Commercial Mall. Preparations have been completed, and the opening ceremony is scheduled to be held at 10:00 AM on October 15th. The association will also hold a tea party for the press in the main hall of the venue at 3:00 PM today (14th) to report on the preparations.</p>
<h3>Artificial Silk Rises by 500,000 in the Past Week, Silk Also Increases Steadily</h3>
<p>Artificial silk rose sharply again last week. 120 Bridge of Heaven Light, one was 3.7 million yuan, up 50,000 yuan on Tuesday. On Wednesday, it suddenly became excited, opening 350,000 yuan higher. It continued to rise by 250,000 yuan on Thursday. It did not fall until the end of the week when the Textile Construction Company increased its allocation, falling by 150,000 yuan. The result was a rise of 500,000 yuan in one week. Miscellaneous brands of light and semi-light, etc., also followed suit. In short, if the allocation cannot meet the actual sales volume, there is no hope of suppressing the price of artificial silk, because the holders of goods see through this mystery and gradually increase the price, forcing manufacturers to bow their heads.</p>
<p>Factory warp is stable, CDE grades, always hovering up and down, with only 50,000 yuan difference. The warp of the new bank is always between 2.7 million and 750,000. Open goods are around 500,000 to 550,000 yuan. People still hope to be optimistic, but there are few transactions, so there is no power to rise. The price of silk goods has increased steadily. The Meiya quilt surface was 2.7 million yuan on Monday, and the smallest was 650,000 yuan on Tuesday. The largest shouted 2.75 million yuan on the weekend. The China Jin embroidery increased by 100 yuan in total last week. The various goods in Shenghang are generally stable, without much change.</p>
<h3>Antimony Imports Still Subject to Control, US Government Recently Announced</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 12th] The Production Management Bureau recently announced that the import control of antimony and antimony-plated materials has been restored. It is said that the purpose of this measure is to limit the import of antimony plating or inferior antimony for refining.</p>
<h3>Senators Request Low-Interest Loans to Rescue Small Industrial and Commercial Enterprises, City Bank Allocates Funds, Finance Committee to Discuss Specific Measures Today</h3>
<p>The current interest rate in this city ranges from 1.2 to 2 cents per month, all settled in 3, 5, 7, or 10 days. On average, in 3 to 5 months, the principal and interest can double. Merchants' prices also increase in the same proportion in order to maintain the principal and interest. Therefore, more than 80% of the people's meager income obtained from hard work all day long is enjoyed by a small number of banks, money shops, and property owners, and the society becomes more stable. Recently, the various low-interest loans requested from the government by various sectors have inevitably been used for lending. Not only have the citizens not received any real benefits, but they have also been harmed. The grain loan is one example. At the same time, the so-called industrial and commercial loans are only available to the upper-level figures with power and means. The government borrows more money, and they make more money. If the livelihood of the lower-level people cannot be improved, the country will not be able to achieve prosperity and happiness, and the society cannot ensure law and order. Senator Xing Xiang and others, in view of this, specially proposed that the Shanghai Bank should provide low-interest loans to suppress prices and ensure the safety of the lives of the majority of the people. The method is for the municipal government to order the Shanghai Bank to allocate funds to lend to small industrial and commercial stores and daily vegetable sellers who are indeed engaged in daily necessities at the lowest monthly interest rate. The government can also restrict the selling prices of the factories, stores, and sellers that receive loans. The Finance Committee of the Municipal Council attaches great importance to this case and has decided to hold a subcommittee meeting at 3:00 PM today on the third floor of the Bank of Communications to discuss specific measures.</p>
<h3>Nanchang Prices Soar, Provincial Government Forms Price Review Committee</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper, Nanchang, 13th] The Nanchang market fluctuated greatly this week, especially with the astonishing rise in the price of yarn and cloth. A woolen overcoat, which only cost around 150,000 last week, rose by 60,000 in one day, costing no less than 200,000. Winter cosmetics have also soared. The gold market was affected by the Shanghai market and climbed by 10,000 this weekend, selling for 250,000. Decorated gold is charged an additional 10,000 for labor, but transactions are weak. Grain prices have also fluctuated slightly. Three-engine Wan rice is 32,000, early rice is 28,000, and snow-white rice is 124,000. Rock sugar is 300,000. The provincial government will form a price review committee due to the high prices affecting the people's livelihood.</p>
<h3>Italian Currency Inflation, Prices Rise 4,600 Times</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Rome, 12th] Italy is currently experiencing a period of extremely dangerous currency inflation. If the government does not take appropriate measures immediately, Italy's fragile economic alert may collapse. The main reason for the current loss of credit in the lira is the Paris Peace Conference's decision that Italy should compensate the Soviet Union with 100 million US dollars. At the same time, at least a portion of the compensation demands of other countries must also be fulfilled.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 12th] The amount of banknotes issued in Italy is almost sixteen times the amount before the war. The official market price index is 2,300 times higher than before, and the black market price index is 4,600 times higher than before.</p>
<h3>American Goods and Chemicals Invade, Domestic Chemical Industry on the Verge of Collapse</h3>
<p>There are currently more than a dozen chemical factories in this city. They prospered briefly in the five months after victory. Most of these factories supplied the city's factories with bleaching powder, potassium chlorate, caustic soda, magnesium carbonate, calcium carbonate, etc. However, since American bleaching powder, potassium chlorate, etc., entered the market, because their prices were lower than the cost of domestic goods, they almost monopolized the trade of chemical raw materials in this city. At this point, the various chemical factories were on the verge of collapse and stopped operating automatically. The Tianyuan Chemical Factory can produce 4-500 boxes of bleaching powder and about 30 boxes of potassium chlorate per month. Now the work in these two major production departments has completely stopped, and only the production of magnesium carbonate and calcium carbonate (rubber raw materials) is maintained.</p>
<h3>Sugar Production Estimated at 30 Million Tons Worldwide</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 12th] The US Department of Agriculture predicts that the world's sugar production for 1946-47 will be 30 million tons, an increase of 10% over 1945-46, but a decrease of 13% from the average production of 1935-39.</p>
<h3>China Silk Changes to Yunnan Silkworm Eggs</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper, Hangzhou, 13th] Regarding the Japanese refusal to transport silkworm eggs to China, this reporter visited Mr. Ge Jingzhong, General Manager of the China Silk Company.

<h3>A Review of the New Goods Tax</h3>
<p>— Xu Riqing</p>
<p>The government began collecting the new goods tax on the 1st of this month, including seven categories: wheat flour, cement, tea, fur, tin foil and superstitious paper, beverages, and cosmetics. The tax rate on cotton yarn was increased from 3.5% to 5%. There were no changes to the old rates for cigarettes, smoked tobacco, firewood, and sugar. The rate for foreign wine and beer increased from 60% to 100%. Recently, manufacturers have been crying out in pain. The woolen textile industry has politely refused the temporary dispatch of personnel to the bureau to collect the goods tax, and tea merchants in Yongjia have even stopped transporting tea to Shanghai. However, according to the Shanghai Goods Tax Bureau, the goods tax is an indirect tax that is passed on to consumers and does not affect manufacturers. What exactly is the goods tax? This is worth exploring.</p>
<p>The goods tax is indeed an indirect tax, so the taxation target is not directly on income earners but on consumers. Therefore, it cannot meet the principle of ability to pay, nor can it meet the principle of sufficient finance. In general theory, it has four shortcomings:</p>
<p>(1) Indirect income, tax payment time, and expenses are all inaccurate.</p>
<p>(2) Although the investigation fee when establishing an indirect tax is small, the subsequent inspection fees, collection fees, etc. are very large.</p>
<p>(3) Indirect taxes can indeed be passed on, but their ultimate destination is mostly the proletariat or the middle class, which violates the principle of fairness.</p>
<p>(4) The collection of indirect taxes hinders industrial development and transportation development, which is not in line with the principles of national economy.</p>
<p>Therefore, the modern tax development process has gradually changed from 1 proportional tax to progressive tax, 2 classified tax to comprehensive tax, and 3 tax on objects to tax on people, all in order to achieve the four principles of equality, accuracy, convenience, and economy. The goods tax is actually out of step with the times. Our government wants to balance fiscal revenue and expenditure and increase tax revenue, but it is still expanding the scope of the goods tax. This measure can only be said to be a last resort.</p>
<p>But can this tax revenue really make up for the deficit finance? Taking tea as an example, when the import surplus is very large and exports are sluggish, it is naturally limited to domestic sales. But how much can this tax revenue be? Taking the woolen textile industry as an example, when "cheap and beautiful" American goods compete with foreign goods, if you add the cost of the goods tax, sales will be even more problematic. The result may only be reduced work and closures. Wheat flour, matches, and sugar are essential commodities for the people, and theoretically should not be taxed. Only cosmetics can be considered a luxury, and it is okay to levy a heavy tax. However, under the dumping of American cosmetics, they have long been unable to gain a foothold, and the production volume is still very limited. How much revenue is there? As for fur, tin foil, and superstitious paper, they are not major commodities and do not provide much help to finance. It is said that the income from the goods tax in Shanghai in August was about 26 billion. I am afraid that after the new goods tax is levied, it may not be able to increase as expected, and the following four disadvantages can be predicted.</p>
<p>(1) Suppressing National Industry: National goods that are already unable to compete with foreign goods, will the cost of sales not increase if the goods tax is levied again? Will its competitiveness not be weaker?</p>
<p>(2) Increasing the Burden on the Common People: Goods tax is mostly consumer goods, which are daily necessities for the people. After the tax is levied, manufacturers will inevitably increase prices, and as a result, only the common people will increase the burden, which is contrary to the government's price stabilization policy.</p>
<p>(3) Making Foreign Goods Sell Even Better: The flooding of American goods has already caused concerns among the community. Now that the cost of domestic goods has increased, will foreign goods not be easier to sell? Although the Jianghai Customs has collected the goods tax on imported foreign goods, the cost of foreign goods is taxed according to the value of the invoice, while domestic goods are taxed according to the market price. How can domestic goods compete?</p>
<p>(4) Tax Evasion of Smuggled Goods Will Inevitably Increase: Currently, tax evasion of smuggled goods has become an open secret, and the government does not seem to have effective measures. Under the high tax rate, it will undoubtedly increase the gambling mentality of ordinary merchants.</p>
<p>Now, the general manufacturers can no longer hold on and are crying out loudly. At this time, the government should carefully consider whether this policy of abandoning the fundamentals and pursuing the trivial is worth pursuing.</p>

<h3>Border Culture and Education Center to Establish a Border Language Printing Press Central Border News to Resume Publication in Beijing</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing 13th Electric] In order to promote national culture and encourage border people to look inward, the Ministry of Education issued a Central Border News in Mongolian and Tibetan in October last year. Later, due to the return to the capital, it was suspended for several months. It has now resumed publication in Beijing and changed to a magazine format, 16 open, and is still issued once a month. In addition, the National Border Culture and Education Center under the Ministry of Education has decided to establish a border language printing press, giving priority to the establishment of Mongolian, Tibetan, and Hui sections, and completing important equipment such as copper mold casting.</p>
<h3>The Ministry of Education Decides to Improve the Academic Level of University Students Focusing on the First Year First</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing 13th Electric] The Ministry of Education believes that the academic level of university students has declined in recent years and should be improved. For example, the passing standard for newly admitted university students last year was 40 points (the situation varies from school to school, and not all schools use 40 points as the passing mark). The Ministry of Education stipulates that the standard must be increased by 10 points to 50 points this year. The fundamental method is to revise the university curriculum standards and the enrollment system.</p>
<p>System Aspects</p>
<p>In the past, the Ministry of Education had established a small number of preparatory classes to accommodate high school graduates who had not been admitted to universities. After passing the preparatory examination, they were guaranteed to be promoted to universities, with a limit of 50% of the quota. This year, the Ministry of Education has issued a notice to all universities and independent colleges to establish preparatory classes. The nature is different from the past. After studying in the class for one year and passing the examination, they will be directly promoted to the university. At the same time, the curriculum standards of various universities will be revised, the content will be sorted out for various major courses, the complicated will be eliminated, and the suitability will be sought, so as to reduce the malpractice of reviewing the teaching materials that have been read in high school in the early stage of the first year of university. The current preparatory class has studied a considerable curriculum for one year and does not need to repeat it, wasting study time.</p>
<p>Curriculum Aspects</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education has long started to revise the entire curriculum of university colleges and is still continuing to do so. However, this matter is of great importance and must be discussed by many experts repeatedly, signed and commented on, and refined before it can be used as a final decision. The date of publication of the standard may be postponed to next year. It is said that the improvement of the education level of university students first focuses on the first year. Following the process already studied in the preparatory class, the curriculum content is eliminated from the complicated, evolved, so as to avoid wasting time. Therefore, in addition to issuing a notice to all universities to improve the English level, the Ministry of Education will also improve the level of other major subjects.</p>

<p>Carrying the Skull Fossil of the Original Man</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Shenyang 12th Electric] Chinese archaeologist Dr. Pei Wenzhong left Shenyang for Ping at 1:30 p.m. on the 12th, carrying the skull fossil of the Zhalainuoer original man.

<p>Great Progress in the Battle</p>
<p>The Conquered Wheels made great progress in the battle last night. The passing and throwing of the three forwards also had wonderful performances from time to time. The defense was very successful. The use of man-to-man defense made the Shantou team helpless. It is a pity that the Conquered Wheels seem to be not yet proficient in the rules of the game, such as the ten-second rule in the backcourt, etc. If the team can be trained for a period of time, young and strong, there is great hope. The Shantou team was very abnormal, the whole team was disorganized, and the shooting was inaccurate. It seemed like a B-group basketball team, resulting in a defeat.</p>
<p>The Conquered Wheels Took the Lead All the Way</p>
<p>The referees Liu Hesheng and Hu Hongxin blew the whistle to start the game. The Conquered Wheels took Yu Ruizhang, Cai Zhongqiang, Zhang Gengsheng, Wang Binghuan, and Tu Wenlong on the court. The Shantou team took Lin Weiting, Liu Jingxing, Ji Nankang, He Lide, and Chen Qingjiang into battle. In the center jump, Yu Ruizhang of the Conquered Wheels opened the scoring. Before long, Lin Weiting of the Shantou team won two free throws, but both missed. Yu Ruizhang of the Conquered Wheels made one free throw and one shot, adding three points. The Shantou team lost its color. Yu Ruizhang and Cai Zhongqiang of the Conquered Wheels were active and abnormal. At the end of the first half, the Conquered Wheels took the lead by 27 to 16.</p>
<p>The Shantou Team Closely Followed but Failed</p>
<p>After the break, Tu Wenlong broke the basket from a distance, and Lin Weiting returned the color. At 33 to 20, Liu Jingxing replaced Lin Weiting, and Cai Yanxiong was pushed into the crowd. The Conquered Wheels called a timeout. At this time, the Shantou team gradually became active, forcing it to 29 to 36. Tu Wenlong was sent off for five fouls, and Liu Zhenjun replaced him. At this time, Lin Jicong entered the field and transferred Cai Yanxiong. The lineup of the Conquered Wheels was inevitably affected by this change. When it was 31 to 36, Cai Zhongqiang fouled again and graduated, and Wang Binghuan replaced him. Chen Qingjiang shot from a distance and hit. Wang Binghuan added three points with a series of throws and penalties. At the end of the statutory time, the Conquered Wheels defeated the Shantou team by 39 to 32.

<p>Civil Affairs Briefing</p>
<h3>Municipal Government Circular to All Districts: Investigate Neglected Public Properties for Transfer to Commercial Use and Promotion of Productive Enterprises</h3>
<p>The Municipal Government approved a resolution from the Municipal Council's first session, which stated that many public buildings in the city had been damaged during the war, leaving behind ruins or wasteland. It was regrettable that these properties remained neglected without reconstruction. Meanwhile, districts seeking to develop projects such as productive enterprises, parks, and public sports fields faced difficulties in finding land. If these neglected public properties could be utilized, with the Municipal Government consulting the relevant authorities for temporary transfer or custodianship, they could serve local public welfare purposes. While temporary, this would still provide some benefit, preserving public assets, preventing neglect, and benefiting the local community significantly. The resolution requested the Municipal Government to issue a circular to all districts to investigate and report on public properties suitable for temporary use, and to transfer them to the relevant authorities for provisional use. The Municipal Government, recognizing the urgent need to develop productive enterprises in each district, issued a "Neglected Public Property Investigation Form" and instructed all districts to investigate and report any suitable neglected public properties for temporary use, so they could be transferred for commercial use.</p>

<p>By Our Reporter Xie Baozhu</p>
<p>My friends have all gone to Hangzhou to play, which makes me a little envious. It's been five years since I last saw West Lake. In the crisp autumn air, the West Lake is filled with light boats, and the sunset reflects on the autumn waves, making it even more graceful and beautiful than before. The green leaves on both sides of Su Causeway should also be fuller now. However, time does not permit, so I can only dismiss the idea. Fortunately, the impression of West Lake is still so vivid and deep. Suddenly, the day before the Double Tenth Festival, someone asked if I wanted to go to Hangzhou. The Jianqiao Air Force Academy had invited some musicians from Shanghai to perform, and a special plane would provide transportation. As soon as I heard the word "Jianqiao," I immediately felt like I was in a huge airport. I imagined the Air Force soldiers fighting the enemy and the tense scenes from movies, and I felt that while West Lake could be visited anytime, the Air Force Academy should be visited now. So, on the morning of National Day, we arrived at this "Cradle of the Chinese Air Force." Before the plane landed, I saw its solemnity and greatness. Twenty-seven planes performed a large formation display, followed by forming a "中" character. On the ground, I saw the podium decorated with flowers, the national flag fluttering around, and rows of Air Force soldiers drilling to the sound of military music. It turned out that the parade had just ended.</p>
<p>Jianqiao Air Force Academy airfield is packed with planes, as dense as dragonflies.</p>
<p>Three Air Force Generals: (Right) General Liu Muqun, (Center) Air Force Commander General Zhou Zhirou, (Left) Air Force Academy Education Director Hu Weike.</p>
<h3>First Impression of Education Director Hu</h3>
<p>Lieutenant Li Chengyuan, a flying instructor at the Air Force Academy who piloted our plane, took us to the Education Director's office. Miss Feiman'er, a violinist, introduced us to Education Director Hu Weike, his wife, and his mother. My first impression of Education Director Hu was that he was a very astute and capable officer. He was tall and sturdy, with a strong military presence, yet also courteous. At first glance, it was clear that he had received a high level of education.</p>
<p>Education Director Hu is from Pingxiang, Jiangxi, and is 38 years old this year. He is a graduate of the first class of the military academy, fifteen years ago. Hu served as an aide to President Dai Jitao and traveled to Germany. In 1943, he went to India and served as the director of the junior class training program at the academy. In 1944, he went to England to study aviation education and returned to China at the end of last year. In August of this year, he came to Jianqiao to preside over school administration. Education Director Hu's every move represents his educational philosophy: "Absolutely strict when strictness is required, absolutely lively when liveliness is required." He himself feels that the students must think he is too strict, but in a military group, in a large team, when we see that everything is well-organized, orderly, disciplined, and systematic, we certainly cannot deny the merits of the leader.</p>
<p>At ten o'clock, the National Day memorial meeting began. We attended the meeting as guests and saw two hundred officers, students, and mechanics neatly arranged in the simply decorated, solemn, and spacious auditorium. Chairman Hu, the Education Director, gave a speech. These expressions of spirit made everyone feel excited. We were happy for the country's strength and for the future of the Air Force.</p>
<h3>The Academy Covers Thousands of Acres with Simple, Orderly, and Complete Internal Facilities</h3>
<p>Instructor Li Chengyuan, the Education Director's adjutant, kindly invited us to visit various places. The size of the Air Force Academy's grounds was far beyond my imagination. According to Instructor Li, it covers thousands of acres, and the racecourse alone is as large as the Shanghai Racecourse.</p>
<p>The military academy currently has the 25th and 26th classes, as well as a small number of 24th class students, totaling 440 students and mechanics. The average age is eighteen to twenty-two years old. There are eighty instructors, as well as support soldiers. They live in rows of dormitories, the interiors of which are very simple and orderly. The cabinets next to each bed are always open for inspection by the officer of the day. Student lounges, recreation rooms, and various facilities are complete. Indoor sports include billiard tables and a special bowling alley. The swimming pool is well-equipped, with clear, turquoise water. Mercury lamps are installed around the pool so that it can be used at night. The auditorium is not very large, but the lighting and layout meet standards. A dressing room is attached to the back for theatrical performances. During the occupation, the enemy built fortresses and stationed cavalry at the academy, destroying all the buildings. The old auditorium was one of the casualties. When the academy was restored a year ago, it was rebuilt according to the old design. At the same time, many officers' residences were also built. When the military academy returned to Jianqiao, it ordered 2,000 Japanese prisoners of war to repair the airfield, school buildings, and plant trees as a practical lesson for the Japanese prisoners. In addition to the racecourse with sixteen small horses, which students take turns riding every morning from seven to eight o'clock, there is also a hunting area on the grounds. There are many wild rabbits and pheasants, and sometimes small foxes and wolves can be hunted. When the reporters visited the school, two American officers who were advisors to the school were about to ask the Education Director to send someone to accompany them hunting. They seemed very enthusiastic.</p>
<p>The school has only a few dozen planes, mostly PT-17s for training, as recovery after the war has not been easy. In addition, it has its own train station and a railway line between Shanghai and Jianqiao, used exclusively for transporting goods.</p>
<h3>A Glimpse of School Affairs</h3>
<p>The Air Force Academy's educational affairs are divided into four departments: (1) The Flight Department, where elementary training lasts for six months, divided into four stages. Preliminary flight training requires 70 hours, and 250 hours must be flown by graduation. (2) The Instruction Department, which is responsible for academic education. (3) The Station Affairs Department, which is responsible for the construction, security, and flight training of the four airfields in Jianqiao, Xixing, Qiaosi, and Jiaxing. (4) The Translation Department, which translates teaching materials, publishes publications, and compiles an aviation dictionary.</p>
<p>The Political Department is responsible for political education, moral education, spiritual training, assessment and anti-espionage, small group discussions, academic research, and recreational activities.</p>
<p>The Business Department is divided into: (1) Provisions. In addition to food, clothing, laundry, and haircuts, which are all provided by the school, each student receives a monthly allowance of about 40,000 yuan. (2) Clothing, which is divided into special and ordinary equipment. (3) Pensions.</p>
<p>The Health Department has an outpatient clinic, airfield rescue, physical examinations, environmental health, and a hospital. Other facilities, such as repair factories and air force radio stations, are also well-equipped. There are more than thirty female nurses and female staff members in the school.</p>
<h3>Musical Performance: The Audience Was Silent</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, it was a holiday on National Day, and the students were scattered, so we were unable to see their classroom and extracurricular activities. However, the evening's musical performance left the most brilliant page in the history of this year's National Day celebration at the Air Force Academy. On a stage with harmonious colors and soft lighting, we listened to Miss Feiman'er's violin solo, soprano solos, renowned violist Professor Pudu Xiga's viola performance, and Mr. Qi Naiqun's bass solo. The most hardworking was Miss Zeng Huixi's piano performance, as she accompanied all the performances from beginning to end, in addition to her two solo pieces. Each performance was very wonderful and beautiful, so it's no wonder that the hundreds of audience members were silent, all captivated.</p>
<p>It was a night of bright moonlight, and everything was quiet in the Air Force Academy. Only the gentle breeze rustled, and the autumn night under the moon in Jianqiao seemed even more poetic and moving, instantly making you forget the troubles of the world. Compared to the turbid and noisy Shanghai, it was truly like the difference between heaven and a filthy pond.</p>
<p>To the sound of horses' hooves, we saw Jianqiao's beautiful early morning again, and the sound of planes in the sky came closer and closer. The reporters took advantage of the morning to row boats on West Lake, which is twenty miles from the school. In the afternoon, we hurried back to the airfield and returned to Shanghai. However, everyone cherished a deep affection for the magnificent and beautiful "Cradle of the Air Force." Every corner of Jianqiao is lovely. May it "rise like the sun" and continue to flourish!</p>
<h3>Xi'an Forms People's Self-Defense Corps</h3>
<p>— Xi'an, September 14 (Our Special Correspondent Li Chi)</p>
<p>From reports from various places, we see that people's self-defense corps or similar organizations have been established in many parts of the country. Xi'an is no exception, and 7,000 citizens have been organized into the first group and have already completed training. In addition to the city's self-defense corps, there is also the Chang'an County People's Self-Defense Headquarters. The former is headed by Kong Lingxun, the Xi'an Garrison Commander, who assumed both positions in August. The latter is headed by Wang Dingbang, and each of the county's 31 townships has a battalion.</p>
<p>The establishment of the Xi'an City People's Self-Defense Headquarters coincided with the anniversary of Japan's surrender on August 13. The fact that a people's self-defense force was still needed a year after Japan's defeat naturally had other reasons. Everyone remembers that in early August, Li Xiannian's troops entered the southeastern corner of Shaanxi from Henan. This was followed by various rumors that were difficult for the general public to discern. Later, we saw that several county magistrates within the province were explicitly punished. Zhou Mengfei, the magistrate of Zhashui County, was demoted and retained for "acting rashly and panicking without clarifying the situation when bandits disturbed the border, failing to fulfill his duties." The county's police chief was also dismissed for "withdrawing without authorization and abandoning his post." Zhao Wenbin, the magistrate of Zhen'an County, was detained and prosecuted for "leaving his post without authorization, abandoning his duties, and causing major negligence." These official documents not only supplemented the inadequacies of the semi-official news reports at the time.</p>
<p>The clearest explanation can be found in an excerpt from a speech by Shaanxi Province Chairman Zhu Shaozhou at the inaugural ceremony of the City People's Self-Defense Headquarters: "...Why do we need to defend ourselves?... First, the Communist Party troops do not listen to the Central Government's orders and roam around everywhere. Li Xiannian's troops even entered our province from Henan and intend to harass Guanzhong. We must protect our lives and property, so we must rise up and defend ourselves. Second, thugs and bandits are disrupting local security. Law-abiding citizens must defend themselves..." This statement is much more concrete than the two missions listed at the beginning of the "Xi'an City People's Self-Defense Corps Regulations." The "Regulations" only state: "The missions of the People's Self-Defense Corps are two: first, to strengthen city defenses; and second, to permanently maintain social order and urban security."</p>
<p>According to the latest statistics at the end of August this year, the population of Xi'an City has increased again to 540,000, with men accounting for three-fifths, or 330,000. How many of these 330,000 men are able-bodied and meet the age requirements stipulated by the "Regulations" (i.e., 20 to 40 years old)? A rough estimate would be that, excluding the majority of men under 20 and over 40, the total number of able-bodied men is around 100,000. The original plan was to train 20,000 of these in three phases. Once this plan is completed in two or three months, the numbers indicate that one out of every five able-bodied men will be in the Self-Defense Headquarters. This is a very high ratio. In addition, there are garrison troops, officer corps, guard units, police, etc., which are already sufficient to maintain local security. The "Regulations" meticulously define the categories of those who are required to train, those who are exempt, and those who are deferred. From the reporter's perspective, it is much more comprehensive than the "People's Militia" or "National Defense Corps" in Guangxi. If this kind of organization could have been widely implemented across the country eight or nine years ago, it would certainly have increased the people's ability to resist the enemy many times over. This principle has been proven by sufficient facts: the maximum mobilization of the people's self-defense power must be when the purpose of using this power is fully aligned with the interests and demands of the entire people.</p>
<p>The 20,000 able-bodied men in the city who are receiving training will be divided into twelve battalions and forty-seven companies according to the police bureau's twelve jurisdictions. Each battalion and company will have a political instructor in addition to the commander. For convenience of training, these 20,000 men will be divided into three phases, with 7,000 in each phase. To date, one-third, or the first phase, has completed training. A recruit must complete 60 hours of training during the training period to graduate. Training time is from 6:00 AM to 8:00 AM in the city and from 5:00 AM to 7:00 AM in the suburbs. In other words, recruits must train for two hours a day for thirty days to complete the program. The "Regulations" also stipulate that "recruits may not use the name or opportunity of training to solicit training subsidies or goods from neighborhood associations, residents, agencies, schools, factories, or shops." However, "factory workers whose training time overlaps with a daily work schedule of ten to twelve hours will be paid twelve hours' wages by the factory; workers whose work schedule is less than ten hours will only receive ten hours' wages." Also, "if wages are calculated based on the quantity of work (e.g., spinning a certain amount of yarn, weaving a certain amount of cloth), the headquarters will negotiate with the factory to decide on the amount."</p>
<p>Even monks and Taoists are not exempt if they are able-bodied men; there are no exceptions for freelancers. However, doctors will participate in the protective corps and be organized into rescue teams; lawyers, accountants, and reporters will have separate procedures. Because most reporters "work at night and rest during the day," it is difficult for them to rush to the training ground at 6:00 AM. They may be organized into a separate team in the second phase, which will begin at the beginning of next month. Commander Kong Lingxun told the local press in a serious tone: "In order to implement national laws and respect the equality of citizens, you must undergo this training!" During the War of Resistance Against Japan, news reporters enjoyed "exemption from military service," but they do not have this "privilege" this time.</p>
<p>In order to strengthen security in the city, in addition to intensifying the training of self-defense corps recruits, a strict household registration check is being conducted recently (even the garrison commander is personally conducting spot checks of senior officials' residences as a demonstration). Starting yesterday, registration of self-defense weapons began. In addition, the provincial authorities have been ordered to set up new conscription districts. There are two divisional headquarters in the province, located in Xi'an and Nanzheng, and five regimental headquarters, located in Xi'an, Nanzheng, Dali, Baoji, and Ankang.</p>
<p>As for national compulsory labor service, it will also be implemented in the city soon. Each person will perform labor for ten days each year. Men between the ages of eighteen and thirty-five will be engaged in road construction, water conservancy, self-defense, local productive enterprises, and other local public welfare projects. However, according to the "Regulations" of the Self-Defense Headquarters, in principle, during the training period, able-bodied men will only participate in one type of organization, receive one type of training, and perform one type of service. Self-Defense Corps recruits will of course be exempt from compulsory labor service.</p>

<h3>Characteristics of the New Conscription Law</h3>
<p>— Chuzi Diao</p>
<p>The new conscription law was promulgated on Double Ten Day. The Republic of China's conscription law, since its promulgation by the National Government in June 1933 and its implementation in March 1936, has a history of ten years. It has been amended twice, once in March 1943, during the height of the War of Resistance. This is the second time. The main principle of this amendment is to establish the foundation for national defense and military construction. The National Government stated clearly in its resumption of conscription order, "To survive today, it is necessary to consolidate national defense, and to enrich national strength, it is essential to implement a conscription system." Therefore, "the original conscription laws and regulations have been revised, and the divisions and regimental districts have been re-established, focusing on national defense needs to determine a peacetime conscription system." From this, it can be seen that the newly promulgated conscription law is the basic law for establishing a peacetime conscription system, containing permanent characteristics and differing in purpose from wartime conscription. All citizens of the Republic of China have the obligation to perform military service. Now that the suspension of conscription has ended, the National Government has explicitly ordered the resumption of continuous conscription. Everyone is related to this new conscription law and should recognize its significance and understand its content. Therefore, the characteristics of the new conscription law are specifically discussed as follows:</p>
<p>First, the new conscription law is non-partisan and purely nationalized. The most satisfying aspect of this revision of the conscription law is that it adheres to the principle of nationalization of the military, truly realizing the separation of the military from political party activities and making it purely nationalized. National unity is a necessary condition for establishing a country, and its only prerequisite is to prevent any one party from possessing an independent army to use force as a tool for political struggle, thereby ensuring that there is no army outside the national army and no military force outside national defense. Only when such a state can be achieved can social stability and people's freedom be guaranteed, and political democratization will not fail. If there are two opposing armies within a country, forming a situation of armed separatism, then it cannot be called a truly unified country. Therefore, Article 30, Paragraph 3 of the new conscription law stipulates: "Conscripts and draftees shall not participate in any gatherings or associations without the permission of their superiors, and those who have already participated shall suspend their activities during their service," so that the military is non-partisan and soldiers are non-partisan. In the old conscription law, Article 1 of the same article originally stipulated the sentence "should swear allegiance to the National Government of the Republic of China," but because the National Government returned power to the people, it is not yet known whether it still has (the old term) any suspicion of forcing conscripts and draftees to be loyal to the Kuomintang, so it was also automatically deleted and changed to "should swear allegiance to the Government of the Republic of China." The fairness and generosity of the National Government's demeanor, as well as its sincerity and eagerness for peaceful unification, can be seen here. Therefore, I dare to say that the new conscription law is non-partisan and is the fundamental law for implementing the nationalization of the military.</p>
<p>Second, the new conscription law is based on the principle of equality between men and women and encourages women to serve in the military.</p>
<p>In China's political status, equality between men and women has long been established, and the rights and obligations that women should enjoy and fulfill should be the same as those of men according to legal principles. In other words, men perform military service, and women should also perform military service. This is not an ideal or a high-sounding statement, as the facts of this world war can prove. According to a 1944 U.S. women's news report, the United States had women's auxiliary corps in the army and navy, each with 100,000 people, and the Coast Guard and Marine Corps women's teams each had 25,000 people. At the end of the war, it was estimated that 250,000 women were discharged from the military. Some members of the U.S. Congress even proposed that women's colleges like West Point and Annapolis be established specifically for women to train them to take on regular work in the military. Therefore, women serving in the military is an inevitable trend in the future. The original draft of the conscription law amended in 1943 stipulated that "women who meet the conscription age may be conscripted to perform military auxiliary duties in wartime." There was no explicit provision on what should be done in peacetime. When the Ministry of National Defense revised it this time, it specifically added "military auxiliary service education may be implemented in peacetime" so that service in wartime can be competent and pleasant. However, when the Legislative Yuan's example meeting deliberated, it was considered that my country's education has not yet been popularized, and there are more illiterate women, so it is feared that it would be difficult to universally force the implementation of military auxiliary service education in practice. Therefore, the four words "according to their wishes" were specifically added, and Article 33 of the new conscription law was changed to "Women who meet the age specified in Article 3 of this Law may be given appropriate military auxiliary service education according to their wishes in peacetime, and may be conscripted to perform military auxiliary service in wartime, and the conscription service shall be determined by law separately." This completely depends on the wishes of the women themselves and does not force them, so it can be suitable for the national conditions. Since military service is the glorious obligation that citizens should fulfill, it is hoped that loyal and courageous knowledgeable women will work hard, actively receive training, and prepare for service in wartime.</p>
<p>Third, the new conscription law raises the status and qualifications of those who perform military service. Military service is an obligation that citizens should fulfill. Teaching about shame and fighting, and defending the country are the most honorable undertakings. Therefore, only healthy citizens are qualified to participate. The erroneous idea of "good iron is not used for nails, good people do not become soldiers" must be completely eradicated. Only those who are not allowed to participate in military service are a great shame and humiliation. In the new conscription law, although the positive qualifications for performing military service only stipulate (1) nationality—must be a citizen of the Republic of China, (2) gender—male, (3) age—full 18 to 45 years old, there are no other strict conditions. However, in terms of negative qualifications, (1) those with physical deformities, disabilities, or chronic diseases are exempt from military service; (2) those who have been sentenced to imprisonment for more than seven years are prohibited from military service. Compared with the original draft of the conscription law amended in 1943, which stipulated that "those sentenced to life imprisonment or deprived of public rights for life are prohibited from military service," the standard for prohibiting military service is much higher, and it is also stipulated that those sentenced to imprisonment or deprived of public rights who have been approved shall be suspended from military service. Good citizens are the foundation of good soldiers, and good soldiers are the model of good citizens. Such amendments to the new conscription law are necessary.</p>
<p>Fourth, the new conscription law tightens the scope of deferred conscription and delayed enlistment. At the beginning of the War of Resistance, the implementation of conscription was in accordance with the conscription law promulgated in June 1933, which had only eight articles in full, and authorized the administrative organs to decide on all decisions on deferred conscription and delayed enlistment, taking into account the actual circumstances. Therefore, at that time, the scope of deferred conscription and delayed enlistment was extremely broad, resulting in the formation of a situation where the rich did not become soldiers, the powerful did not become soldiers, and the knowledgeable did not become soldiers, which was far from the three principles of equality, fairness, and averaging. At the same time, it gave those who carried out military service the opportunity to commit fraud. When the conscription law was amended in 1943, it was specifically stipulated in writing to restrict it. This time, the new conscription law tightens it even more. For example, the conditions for delayed enlistment originally had six items, but the new conscription law only adopts three items, namely (1) those who go abroad on official business, (2) students above high school who have not graduated, and (3) those who are being prosecuted for serious crimes. And the remaining three items, namely (1) those whose physical illness makes them unable to move, and who have been proven to be true, (2) those whose direct relatives or spouses have died for less than one month, and (3) those who are solely responsible for the livelihood of the family without siblings, are all deleted. In addition, the conditions for deferred conscription have also deleted the original two items in the conscription law amended in 1943: (1) those who are currently serving as recommended officials or above and have been qualified by the銓叙, and (2) those who are currently serving as regular police officers. This regulation has at least three advantages: first, there are fewer exceptions, which can make it appear more equal, fair, and average; second, the source of soldiers is wide, which can increase the number of outstanding people serving in the military; and the biggest advantage is the third, which can reduce the opportunity for military service personnel to commit fraud. Because the scope of deferred conscription and delayed enlistment is wide and there are many conditions, it is possible to change and cheat from it.</p>
<p>Fifth, the new conscription law adjusts the rights enjoyed by those who perform military service. The conscription law amended in 1943 was implemented during wartime, so the rights enjoyed by active soldiers had to be specially favored to encourage them. Such as (1) debts incurred before enlistment, when unable to pay, may be extended to be paid within two years after the expiration of the service period, (2) spouses and direct relatives may enjoy preferential treatment for living relief; (3) after discharge, they have the priority to fill positions in institutions, legal entities, schools, and factories; (4) the rights that should be enjoyed under meritorious awards, pensions, and other laws and regulations. Except for the fourth item, the above seem to be too generous in peacetime. The new conscription law limits the rights enjoyed by active soldiers to "serving in the military for the country." If they are fighting for territory for private individuals or acting as tools for political parties, they are not included. Relief for the lives of spouses and direct relatives should be provided only when they are performing combat duties and their families are indeed unable to maintain their livelihoods. As for the item "after discharge, they have the 'right' to priority to fill positions in institutions, legal entities, schools, and factories," it is also inconsistent with the principle of making the best use of talents and is quite difficult to achieve. The difficulty of changing the ban on veterans is proof of this. Therefore, the new conscription law has been changed to "Students who are enlisted and should be enlisted shall be allowed to retain their student status, and employees shall be allowed to retain their original positions. Unemployed persons shall have the right to priority employment after discharge and repatriation." As for the repayment of debts, it should be based on the Civil Code and general regulations, so it is no longer adopted. After the conscription system is universally implemented, the whole country will be soldiers, and everyone will be the same. There should no longer be special regulations on the enjoyment of private rights.</p>
<p>Sixth, the new conscription law divides into three types: standing military service, supplementary military service, and national military service.</p>
<p>In the past, military service was only divided into two types: national military service and standing military service. The new conscription law adds a supplementary military service type. Article 8 of the new conscription law stipulates that supplementary military service is divided into two types: active service and reserve service. Active service: All men who meet the excess number of standing soldiers in active service shall be conscripted into the camp each year according to national defense needs, and the standing division or管區 shall give them four to six months of training. At the end of the period, they shall be discharged from the army and serve in the reserve until they reach the age of 45 and are discharged from service. This regulation is a supplement to standing military service. Because the country's financial resources are limited, it cannot conscript a large number of young men of the right age to serve in the standing army in peacetime. It can only draw a part of those who have passed the conscription inspection into the camp by lottery. However, once a problem occurs in national defense and a large number of soldiers are needed, if the national army is used as a supplement, the quality seems to be too poor. Therefore, a supplementary military service level is added, and they are enlisted into the camp to receive four to six months of military training to prepare for supplementary service at any time. Taking into account both peacetime and wartime is a progressive step.</p>
<p>Seventh, the new conscription law re-plans the management organization. The military service system, which supplies combat soldiers, is the only way to build a strong country and is the foundation of all military administration. Therefore, it should be handled uniformly by the central government, maintaining an independent organization and system, without resorting to local governments. In the past, military管區s were set up in provinces, and division and regimental管區s were set up below the provinces. The scope of the管區s was consistent with the local administrative regions, rather than based on the population. As a result, the distribution of兵額 was quite different, and the power was in the hands of the provincial chairman兼military管區 commander. Therefore, this time, the new conscription law re-establishes the institutions of各管區, cancels the military管區 system, and divides the country into several division管區s and regimental管區s based on population, sets up division and regimental管區 command headquarters, which are under the command and supervision of the常地 military senior organs, and separately handle military service and related affairs within their respective管區s (see Article 16). The county magistrate and city mayor are the county and city conscription officers, and are under the command and supervision of the 管區 commander, handling military service and related affairs within the district, which are completely entrusted matters. The provincial governor and the mayor of the院轄市 are conscription supervisors, who are only responsible for assistance and are no longer military 管區 commanders, so as to maintain an independent military service system and be less constrained by local governments. Exclusive power集巾 is one of its characteristics.</p>
<p>Eighth, the new conscription law pays special attention to the development of the navy and air force. The navy and air force should be given special attention in national defense, for reasons that are very obvious and need not be stated. The physical strength: intelligence standards of naval and air force personnel need to be particularly strict, which is also a fact. In the past revised conscription laws, it can be said that the army's conscription was the main body, and the navy and air force were only lightly mentioned in the appendix with a clause such as "Except for the special provisions of the law, the provisions of this law shall apply mutatis mutandis to the conscription of the navy and air force." In the new conscription law, a special chapter is listed for the navy and air force, and it is clearly stipulated that "Those who meet the requirements for standing 丘 active service, and whose physical and intellectual abilities meet the requirements for naval and air force officers, non-commissioned officers, and soldiers, may be given priority to be conscripted as volunteers. If the number of volunteers is insufficient for the conscription quota, the qualified persons may be determined by lottery." The inclusion of naval and air force conscription in a special chapter is the first time, and its emphasis on the navy and air force can be imagined.</p>
<p>In short, the conscription law is the great law of the country, and it is the foundation for the country to establish the army. Its importance is no less than that of the military regulations. This revision of the new conscription law makes it the most precious and great code that is not restricted by time and space, nor is it affected by politics. At the same time, the nationalization of the army also takes this as its foundation. We admire the non-partisan demeanor of the National Government's legislation, and the general public should recognize the importance of the new conscription law and its characteristics, faithfully abide by it, and actively enlist to establish the foundation for national defense and military construction.</p>

<p>Production and Construction</p>
<h3>A Retrospect on the American Industrial Revolution</h3>
<p>— Yan Haoying</p>
<p>In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, when Europeans migrated to the Americas, they must have brought the handcraft methods used in Europe to America, which is a very natural fact. When the Industrial Revolution occurred, the Europeans were bound to bring the newly invented manufacturing methods to America, which is also very natural. However, the British government quickly saw the commercial benefits of these new machines and issued strict orders prohibiting the export of various machine drawings to foreign countries or colonies—so the American people had to work hard to seek the invention of various new machines, but there were no significant achievements. It was not until 1790 that Samuel Slater constructed several Arkwright spinning machines for the Almy and Brown factory in Pawtucket, Rhode Island, that it could be considered somewhat successful. Slater was a young Englishman who had previously worked with Strutt, a colleague of Arkwright, so he had some experience with this type of machine. The spinning machine he built could rotate 72 spindles at a time, and the appearance of the factory was very spectacular. In addition, nine spinning machines were constructed elsewhere at the same time, but none of them had such significant achievements as Slater's. Therefore, Slater's factory was regarded as the embryo of the American factory system, and Slater was regarded as the ancestor of the American manufacturing industry. As for the factory that can weave cloth from raw materials in one factory, the Woltham factory built in 1814 is considered the earliest in the world.</p>
<p>These early factories were of course modeled on the British method, and the size of the scale was often limited by the available water power. Although the people in that area showed special industrial skills very early, which made the reputation of New England even more prominent. However, manual craftsmanship and manual industry continued to prosper in other occupations for several years, and the development of the new factory system was also relatively slow in the early 19th century.</p>
<p>The earliest and most reliable report on the industrial situation at this time is the census report at the end of 1850. At this time, the word "manufacturing" still broadly included any machine work, and in addition to organized factories, it also included the建築 industry and handicraft industry. According to this report, the total value of industrial products during this period was US$500 million, and the average output of all factories in 1849 was US$4,300. In addition, other characteristics of modern industrial life gradually laid the foundation at that time. For example, the commercial class engaged in domestic and foreign trade developed at this time; and the various combinations of manufacturing, transportation, wholesale, and retail industries commonly seen in our modern industrial life were also discovered one by one at this time. And when the scope of commerce gradually expanded and the scale of industry gradually developed, those entrepreneurs who specialized in providing capital for industrial and commercial enterprises also arose in response to the tension of financial problems.</p>
<p>In the second half of the 19th century, the American Wang industry suddenly developed, both in terms of the value and quantity of its products. The country leapt from the status of a nascent industry to the position of world leader, but this situation was not without reason. First, because the country's population increased sharply, the domestic market naturally could not but expand accordingly. Second, because the country had been completely developed at this time, natural raw materials were very abundant, and the yield of arable land and coal mines was extremely sufficient. Third, and most importantly, on the one hand, because the country's desire for progress made inventors, engineers, and manufacturers aware of the importance of handicraft transfer principles. On the other hand, because of the country's open and frank attitude, the best technologies of other countries were continuously introduced to the United States. Therefore, in the end, the country was able to develop a large-scale production method to make the most of various newly invented manufacturing methods and to further expand the use of the division of labor system. We only need to see the country's tables, sewing machines, reapers, automobiles, and other manufacturing to know the various characteristics of the country's manufacturing, such as the huge number of products, the uniformity of product standards, and the interchangeability of product parts, which are very different from the European methods that still mostly rely on handicrafts. Therefore, in 1899, the total value of American manufactured products reached 10,000,000,000 yuan, of which less than one-tenth was made by hand. The world of large enterprises can be said to have begun. By 1904, 79% of the manufactured products in the United States were manufactured by factories with an annual output of more than 100,000 yuan. In 1914, this proportion increased to 84.6%.</p>
<p>There is a very important reason why the American factory system was able to make rapid progress during this period, that is, the invention of the steam engine has made it possible to expand the scale of a factory without limit. The impact of this reason is even more obvious after the invention of the generator and the Electrical Diotribution of Energy, because these methods and electric lights have fundamentally reformed the construction of factories, which is more advanced than the factories that relied entirely on water power to turn machines a hundred years ago. In addition, the application of steam engines to land and water transportation is also a very important advancement, which not only helps the marketing of manufactured products, but also makes it more convenient to transport raw materials to industrial centers. Therefore, in the beginning, although all kinds of newly invented textile machines had to rely on water power, and water power was also the only ability that could be obtained at that time, the location of the factory did not have to be near the water after the invention of the steam engine. Moreover, since the transportation method has been improved, not only can the gathering of workers and the concentration of machinery be managed in operation, but also the completed manufactured products can be more easily distributed to various places, which is another benefit in addition to increasing the efficiency of the production method. In addition, in the past, because of the inconvenience of transportation, handicraft workers in various places far away from the factory could often compete with the factory; now this competition has also disappeared invisibly. However, the transportation method itself often progresses with the advancement of the production method, because since the production method has been improved, people also use new production methods to construct transportation machinery.</p>
<p>In addition to the above inventions, we must also add telegraphs, telephones, wireless machines, and other improved means of transportation. These things have the possibility of being applied in commerce, and are almost daily necessities and conveniences for all people; however, the reason why their use can be so universal still depends on modern production methods. Therefore, the progress of transportation and transportation can certainly help the improvement of production methods, and the improvement of production methods can turn around to make the efficiency of transportation and transportation even higher; the extraordinary development of these production machine distribution systems is really something that people in the past had never seen. In other words, the evolution of production tools and the evolution of transportation methods were originally the earliest three major problems that encouraged people to strive forward. Now these things have developed to a degree that our ancestors had never dreamed of at the same time, and have developed the efficiency of the industrial system to a degree that is almost difficult for human power to control.</p>
<h3>Farm Income and Farmland Prices</h3>
<p>— Translated by Zhong Deqi</p>
<p>The relationship between farmland market prices and farm income is extremely large, but our country pays very little attention to this issue. The author of this article, Ardron B. Lewis, is a famous American agricultural economist. He came to China in October 1933 to give lectures and participate in the "China Land Utilization" survey, serving as the chief statistician. He left his post in June 1936. He wrote a chapter on "Prices and Taxes" in "China Land Utilization." He is currently employed by the U.S. International Training Administration and is very concerned about China's agriculture. Now he specifically raises this issue to our country and hopes to conduct joint research and comparison with the United States. The translation is provided for reference by all parties. Translator's note.</p>
<p>Now that the war has been won, agricultural economists in China, the United States, and other countries can turn their full attention to various construction projects again, and particularly focus on permanent and mainly beneficial research. There are many agricultural economic facts whose relationships cannot be fully explained by management regulations. One of them is the relationship between farm income and farmland market prices. The results of my investigation in the United States before the war showed that the total value of farms—land, buildings, livestock, and tools—in different economic grades of land is proportional to the "Return prn man" of various grades of land (Translator's note: "Man" refers to "Man—cquivaleut"). The "Return prn man" is the total income divided by the total number of "Man years" (Translator's note: an adult male worker working 10 hours a day in the field is called an artificial unit. If he works all year round, he can be called an artificial year) obtained by the farm owner, farm landowner, and farm employees in the farm this year, often the field owner counts one "artificial year", and the farm owner counts one "artificial year", regardless of whether the field is owned by the farm owner or not.</p>
<p>If the above principle holds, then there are many interesting conclusions that follow. And those conclusions will affect the government's policies on agricultural loans, farm taxes, and land prices. To test this principle, two basic tools for agricultural economic research are needed, namely farm management survey records and land economic classification maps. The Department of Agricultural Economics of Jinling University has already done and used these tools in many studies, and will naturally continue to use them in the future.</p>
<p>In establishing agricultural economic principles, China and the United States should conduct joint research, and the agricultural economists of the two countries should continue to observe and correct each other's work. The principles established by the two countries are likely to be reliable; and any differences in the principles between the two countries will give us many lessons and lead us to discover even more distant truths.</p>
<h3>General Introduction to Business Management</h3>
<p>— Xu Baiyi</p>
<p>Cost Accounting Meetings and Bookkeeping - Sixth Problem of Production Organizations</p>
<p>When discussing this type of work, we must first start with the order of implementation. When the management department notifies the production department to begin work, there must be a procedure. This procedure can be called a notification form. The number of notification forms can be determined according to the situation, but it is usually three: one for the production department, one for the cost accounting department, and one to be kept by the management department. The cost accounting department can then use this notification form as a basis, and then, based on the material requisition (a document that the production department uses to obtain materials from the warehouse), can record the required materials. Based on the wage payment slip, the wages used can be recorded. This item is relatively simple; what is more complex is the distribution of expenses.</p>
<p>Expenses can be divided into two types: fixed and variable. Rent, insurance, taxes, depreciation, light and heat, electricity, etc., can all be considered fixed. Even if there is an excess, it is a very limited amount. As for other items, they can be adjusted at any time.</p>
<p>There are several methods for allocating fixed expenses:</p>
<p>A. For rent expenses, calculate based on location. For example, if a factory has a total area of ​​so many square feet, the cost per square foot can be calculated from the rent paid. To illustrate with an example: A factory in the north has an area of ​​3,000 square feet, and the monthly rent paid is 30,000 yuan, then the average cost per square foot is 10 yuan. If the management department occupies an area of ​​500 square feet, then the management department should bear an expenditure of 5,000 yuan under the rent item. Conversely, 5,000 yuan is paid for the area occupied by the management department.</p>
<p>B. Expenses for lighting and heating are calculated based on location.</p>
<p>C. Electricity is calculated based on actual consumption and averaged.</p>
<p>D. Other items: determined according to the situation.</p>
<p>Example illustration:</p>
<p>Suppose we are manufacturing a product, and a batch totals 1,000 pieces. The expenses incurred are as follows:</p>
<p>1.  Raw materials (based on the actual consumption recorded in the material requisition): 50,000 yuan</p>
<p>2.  Wages (total manufacturing time is five days, with an average daily wage of 5,000 yuan): 25,000 yuan</p>
<p>3.  Expenses</p>
<p>Management (calculated for five days): 20,000 yuan</p>
<p>Rent (calculated for five days): 5,000 yuan</p>
<p>Insurance (calculated for five days): 1,000 yuan</p>
<p>Taxes (calculated for five days): 1,000 yuan</p>
<p>Depreciation (calculated for five days): 2,000 yuan</p>
<p>Light, heat and electricity (calculated for five days): 2,000 yuan</p>
<p>The total is 106,000 yuan, so the cost per piece of product is 106 yuan.</p>

<h3>Random Notes on Novels</h3>
<p>— Zhenzi</p>
<p>The Complete Biography of Subduing Demons</p>
<p>"The Complete Biography of Subduing Demons" was written by a person of the Ming Dynasty. Sun Kaidi's "Bibliography of Chinese Popular Novels" Volume 2, "Historical Stories of the Ming and Qing Dynasties" records it, without volume or chapter numbers. It records: "Ma Yuqing's collection has a Ming edition, with only volumes two to five remaining, volume five ends at chapter sixty, and the total number of volumes and chapters in the book is unknown." It also says: "Written by an anonymous person of the Ming Dynasty, titled 'Compiled by Layman Qingyin of Wu Xing Hui Ji,' 'Reviewed by Lazy Immortal Resident Yinghai of Hongdu,' and 'Revised by Scholar Shuanglong Yanping of Pengcheng,' it narrates the rebellion of Xu Hongru during the Tianqi period." The "Bibliography" was completed in the spring of the 22nd year of the Republic of China, and only the incomplete Ma collection was seen. In the same year, Zheng of Changle first obtained the complete book in Peiping. The words "Eastern Yi" and "Tatar Slave" in the book were all dug out and changed, which should be a reprint from the early Qing Dynasty. The complete book has six volumes and seventy-two chapters, narrating the Shandong rebellion initiated by Xu Hongru, a member of the White Lotus Sect, in the second year of Tianqi, which spread throughout the country. The book is titled "Newly Compiled Popular Romance of the Imperial Ming Dynasty, The Complete Biography of Subduing Demons of the Seven Luminaries," but the beginning of the original book is titled "Newly Compiled Popular Romance of the Imperial Ming Dynasty, The Later Complete Volume One of the Subduing Demons of the Seven Luminaries." It is speculated that its initial name should be "The Later Biography of Subduing Demons," to continue "The Three Suis' Biography of Subduing Demons"; later it was renamed "The Complete Biography of Subduing Demons," and the word "Later" was dug out and changed to "Complete," but when digging out and changing volume one, one carelessly moved the next word down, thus mistakenly changing "Later Biography" to "Later Complete." At the beginning of the book is a preface by Wen Guangdou in the fourth year of Tianqi, Jiazi, so the time of completion should not be too far away, only two years away from Xu Hongru's rebellion, which was probably also a "newly heard" novel at the time. Wen's preface briefly describes the course of the rebellion, saying: "My friend Huiji, who has also witnessed the beginning and end of the matter, has written a biography to record the causes of its rise and fall, expressing praise and criticism through subtle language, setting up lodging to eliminate evil, and using magic to subdue demons. This uses illusion to replace illusion, borrowing the meaning of using falsehood to reveal truth." It also says: "Huiji, of the Wu Xing clan, is a descendant of Taishi Gong of Huainan Shizhou. He wanders the lakes and seas, laughs and is proud of the universe, storing hundreds of schools of thought within, and harmonizing nature and destiny within, a person beyond the world."</p>
<p>According to the book title "Layman Qingyin of Wu Xing Hui Ji," Qingyin Layman is a pseudonym, Huiji should be his given name or alias, and Wu Xing is the origin of the Shen family's lineage, so the author should be Shen Huiji. Since Huiji is a grandson of Shen Shizhou, there may be clues to be found. According to Shizhou, whose given name is Kun, a native of Huai'an, he was a Jinshi in the twentieth year of Jiajing, and was granted the title of Compiler of the Hanlin Academy, in the first rank, and was in charge of the Southern Hanlin Academy. When he was in mourning, he encountered the invasion of Japanese pirates, gathered local soldiers and defeated them greatly, but was later accused and went to the imperial prison. He wrote "The Collection of Shen Jijiu." Shizhou was a good friend of Wu Cheng'en. There are poems and prose such as "Gift to Shen Shizhou" and "Epitaph for the Joint Burial of the Hanlin Academy Compiler Ru Linlang Shen Gong" in "The Remaining Manuscripts of Sheyang." The "Epitaph" was written for Shizhou's father, Wei (written in Bingchen, the thirty-fifth year of Jiajing), which records Wei's descendants: "Three grandsons: Geng, engaged to the Lu family; Jia, engaged to the Jin family; Xin, engaged to the Zhang family." Wei's grandsons are Kun's grandsons, so Huiji's name should also be  口. These Geng, Jia, and other people are suspected to be Huiji's older brothers, not Huiji. When Wu wrote the "Epitaph," Shen Kun was only fifty years old (born in Dingmao, the second year of Zhengde, 1507 in the Western calendar, according to Fan Yixu's "A Scoop of Huai Flow" Volume Down, "After the Palace Examination Register of Shen Jijiu," calculated at the age of thirty-five during the provincial examination), his grandsons must have been very young. Assuming that Geng and the other three were ten years old at the time (already engaged), they would have been elderly men in their seventies when they wrote the novel in the fourth year of Tianqi, and probably would not have had such enthusiasm. Therefore, Huiji should be a younger brother of Geng and others, not yet born when Wu wrote the article, and there is no name in the lineage. The descendants of the Shen family are declining, and the genealogy has not been seen, otherwise it would not be difficult to investigate. Also, Shen Kun's article  Kai Cheng's collection has a manuscript, which was deliberately destroyed during the war. It has not been seen. I don't know if Huiji was mentioned in it?</p>
<h3>Translators of Manchu Novels</h3>
<p>According to Sun Kaidi's "Bibliography of Chinese Popular Novels" Appendix (5) "Brief List of Manchu Translations of Novels," there are: "Former Seven Kingdoms," "Romance of the Three Kingdoms," "Golden Lotus," "Water Margin," "A Jue Shi Ming," " Zhi," "Welcoming the City Walls," "Sai Hongsi," "Two Marriages," "Returning Lotus Dream," "Eight Immortals," "Three Teachings Novel" (three types), " History Romance," "Ping Shan Leng Yan," "Journey to the West," "Post-Journey to the West," eighteen types and four other books. Only "Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio" is titled Zakedan, and "Ke Xin Lu" is titled     , the rest are not written by the translator.</p>
<p>According to Sun's book, the translator can be known.</p>
<p>Chen Kangqi's "Yan Xia Xiang Cuo Lu" Volume 10 says: "Luo Guanzhong's "Romance of the Three Kingdoms" mostly draws materials from Chen  Xi's  Chi's book, which is not entirely fictitious. In the fourth year of Chongde, Emperor Taizong ordered Grand Secretary Dahai to translate "Mencius," "Comprehensive Mirror," "Six Secret Teachings," and also this book, but it was not completed. In the seventh year of Shunzhi, the Romance was completed, and Grand Secretary Fan Wensu Gong Wencheng and others  awarded  silver coins for their efforts. In the early years of the Qing Dynasty, many Manchu generals who did not know Chinese benefited from this." The translator of "Romance of the Three Kingdoms" is Dahai, Fan Wencheng, etc. It is suspected that Dahai and Fan Wencheng were in charge of the matter, and the entire book was not necessarily written by the two of them alone, because most of the books written in the inner court are signed with the name of the person in charge. It is also said that the Romance was completed in the seventh year of Shunzhi. According to the "Review," the Peiping Library and the Palace Museum each have a Manchu-Chinese joint  edition from the seventh year of Shunzhi, which should be the earliest printed edition of this book.</p>
<p>Ji Xiu Zhuren Zhao  "Xiao Ting Xu Lu" Volume 1 "Translation Room" says: "There is a household  Langzhong Heshu who translates extremely well. His translations of "Romance of the West Chamber" and "Golden Lotus" are accurate in every detail, and people scramble to recite them." According to this, the translator of the two books should be Heshu. However, Wu (son of Lana) in his "Annotated Edition of Suiyuan Poetry Talks" noted Xu in the original book Volume 5  Yuan's affairs and wrote: "The translation of "Golden Lotus" came from the hand of Xu Dieyuan, whose Manchu and Chinese were the best in the dynasty. Dieyuan's surname is Shumulu, a Manchu from the Zhengbai Banner, but although he and Yang Guli, a meritorious minister of the founding of the country from the Zheng Huang Banner, also have the surname Shumulu, they are not from the same clan." According to Yuan's "Poetry Talks," Xu Dieyuan's name is Yuanmeng, a Jinshi of Kangxi Guichou. This says that Xu translated it, which differs from Zhao's  statement. The "Bibliography" records that "Golden Lotus" has a carved edition from the forty-seventh year of Kangxi, which is in the same era as Xu Yuanmeng; the era of Heshu is unknown.  Searching for the Eight Banner documents, the problem is often not difficult to solve, but it is not easy to obtain books in southern China.</p>
<h3>Oar</h3>
<p>— Shibei</p>
<p>In the Bund Park, I sat alone on a chair by the Huangpu River, quietly watching the turbulent river. Those densely lined, huge ships with fat bellies blocked the far side of the river, and black smoke billowed from the chimneys, obscuring the sky on one side; the flags waving in the air could not be seen, only the brightly lit electric lights could be seen. Many light and nimble motorboats, like shuttles on a spinning machine, kept bumping and splashing white waves, like a pile of tangled hemp, dragging behind them. In the middle of these high-spirited giant and lively small motorboats, was our small wooden boat, the only small boat powered by oars. It and those behemoths and jumping imps formed two distinct contrasts on the Huangpu River—one was sharp and the other was a somber mood.</p>
<p>A long, curved oar was tied to the back of the wooden boat. With this oar, the boat could be propelled forward or swayed left and right. At first, the father, mother, and young daughter were rowing. These six hands desperately held onto the ropes hanging from the oar, rowing and rowing, and their whole bodies swayed with the ropes. The waves crashed against their boat, and they looked ahead, unhurried and calm, rowing with all their might. After a while, the  old man at the stern of the boat also stood up and climbed onto the ropes, silently rowing the oar with them. This old man was probably the grandfather. His wrinkled, confused eyes stared at a motorboat rushing towards them from the front. A large wave surged, and their bodies were completely intertwined with the ropes.</p>
<p>I don't know why, but I only love this small wooden boat. My eyes follow its movements. Faced with these two discordant moods on the river, do I sympathize with the smallness of this small wooden boat, or am I worried about the fate of being overwhelmed by the waves? I can't express my feelings...</p>
<p>The old man's hair is already gray. He has been rowing this oar all his life, and now his descendants will have to row this oar! When will they be able to finish rowing? Their strength is exhausted, but the water on the river will never be still!</p>
<p>In my hometown in the south, to go from the countryside to the city, it is necessary to cross the river by small wooden boat. Every time I went to the city with my mother by boat, I loved to watch the two oars moving on the side of the boat, and I loved to listen to the old man rowing the oars tell about his life. The old man's son had another small wooden boat, and he also rowed oars for people every day. During the flood season in summer and autumn, we could see the old man's grandson standing at the bow of the boat helping to row the oars. I remember once my mother said to me: "They live by rowing an oar for three generations!" These distant memories have now been vividly recalled before my eyes.</p>
<p>Life is like a boundless ocean, and the oar is a living tool that each of us cannot lack. On the vast river, in the surging ocean, on the bustling land, ... all kinds of people grasp all kinds of different oars of life, and in order to survive, we keep rowing!</p>
<p>Recalling the old man rowing the oars in my hometown, and seeing the three generations rowing an oar in front of me, I want to muster up the courage and row my own oar!</p>
<h3>Farewell Dinner</h3>
<p>— Xie Ziwen</p>
<h3>Remembering Xiang Peiliang</h3>
<p>— Zhao Jingshen</p>
<p>Xiang Peiliang was a cadre of the Kuang Biao Society, and was as famous as Gao Changhong. A Ying's "Historical Material Index" (Chinese New Literature Series) says that he was "a playwright and critic from Qianyang, Hunan. He was the editor of the Qingchun Monthly. He wrote many works, the main ones being "The Art of Mankind," "A General Review of Chinese Drama," "Bright Drama," "Depressing Drama," "Purple Song Opera Collection," "Hero and Beauty," "I Left the Crossroads," etc." I once carefully read "A General Review of Chinese Drama," because at that time I was compiling "A Short History of Chinese Literature," and there were very few books that systematically discussed Chinese New Literature at that time, so this book especially made me pay attention and  like it.</p>
<p>A few days ago, he, with a  resembling Xu Dishan, his eyes bright and energetic, came to my house on crutches to see me. I was very interested in his crutches. I remember more than ten years ago, when we both lectured at the Women's Literary College in the city, he was already using a crutch. I said, "Have you used this crutch for more than ten years?" He said that he had taken it from his brother last year, and his own had been lost.</p>
<p>He talked about teaching at the Wuxi Guoxue Institute for several years, and followed the school everywhere to move, from Guilin to various places to escape the war. Once, he even escaped to the Yao people's cave. In addition to the Yao language, they could also speak the Guilin Mandarin, so there was no language barrier, and the custom of jumping the moon was also gone. I hope that he will record the local customs and customs, which must be very interesting and can broaden our horizons.</p>
<p>When Guozhuan moved back to Wuxi, he often met with Zhou Yibai. Guozhuan was very close to Zhou's residence, and there were not many friends in Wuxi, so their interactions were very close, and Yibai often talked to him about me.</p>
<p>Recently, Peiliang has been teaching drama courses at the Social Education College in Zhuozheng Garden, Suzhou, which is of course outstanding and suitable. I remember that  before, he taught art and aesthetics at an art college in Hankou for several years, and his research in this area was also quite profound.</p>
<h3>Autumn Night</h3>
<p>— Xiaofeng</p>
<p>I turned on the lamp, sat close to the window, and listened attentively to the sound of the rain outside the window. I heard the wind of this autumn night shaking the bamboo bushes in the backyard, making a rustling sound. I heard the raindrops of this cold night dripping down from the eaves, knocking on the stone steps under the eaves one by one. In this windy and rainy autumn night, I began to feel desolate, lonely, and it aroused my infinite memories.</p>
<p>I remembered an autumn night eight years ago, on a muddy ancient road, my classmates and I groped in the dark. At that time, we were returning from propaganda in a small town, and the autumn rain drenched our clothes and shattered our "Anti-Japanese Propaganda Team" flag. Although we groped on this muddy road and fell into the muddy fields, our hearty singing and laughter, like our enthusiasm, burst forth.</p>
<p>I also remembered on a windy and rainy autumn night, I suffered the spurs of life, and walked alone on a deserted road. In that vast wilderness, there were no hotels, no lights, and I only had endless horror. Wandering in this vast dark night, how much I yearned for light and warmth! I hoped to avoid the wind and rain of this autumn night in a small thatched shed.</p>
<p>I lowered my head, closed my eyes, and thought silently. On this night after several years, I cherish the many old and bitter memories even more.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a faint moan floated in from outside the window, like someone sighing leisurely in this windy and rainy autumn night. I pushed open the window, poked my head out and looked around, wanting to find the source of this groan. The street had a desolate appearance, the light of the electric lamp seemed to have become dim, only a small military vehicle with a beam of light slowly drove past in the mud.</p>
<p>With the help of the faint light, I saw a row of winding houses on the opposite side, and a disheveled beggar curled up in the depths of the wall. When the wind was strong and the rain was heavy, he trembled slightly, trying to get his body closer to the wall, and faint moans replaced his deep curses.</p>
<p>In the middle of the night, when I woke up from a dream, the wind and rain had stopped, and a faint moonlight was seeping through the gaps in the paper window, sadly scattering on the desk. I closed my eyes and quietly listened to the world in the deep night. I heard the paulownia leaves outside the window drifting in the breeze, the rustling sound like the light sigh of an old man. The sad sound of the autumn insects was grieving for the misfortune of these withered leaves.</p>
<p>I heard again the faint groan coming from outside the window. I thought that this is the season of autumn, and behind the autumn season, there is a string of cold winter days hidden. Although winter has passed, spring will come, and the sunshine of spring will relieve  people's threats. However, this harsh season is still so long!</p>
<h3>An Inch of Territory, An Inch of Blood 62</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>I discussed with my brother Hu, and thought  to take a car, but not only was the price high, but it was also not guaranteed to be chartered. If we couldn't get through, we had to get  tickets, and they couldn't be refunded. As we were talking, we caught sight of a woman dressed like a countrywoman, walking straight to us and saying, "Excuse me," that she didn't recognize the words, and asked what time the car was on the sign. We carefully looked at the woman, and then I told her, "It's written seven o'clock, but the time has already passed. The tickets haven't been sold yet."</p>
<p>The woman muttered to herself, "More than forty miles, how can people walk? Wait then, the car will have to come anyway." As she spoke, she put her small handbag beside us and sat down on our chair. After a while, she asked us where we were going? Shuangqiao? Tongzhou? Are you siblings? Are they relatives? Or neighbors? We didn't pay much attention, and vaguely said they were relatives.</p>
<p>"You're probably going to Tongzhou?" She asked us again after a while. I was about to perfunctorily say something to her again, preparing to find another place to sit, when Hu Di lightly nudged me, suddenly stood up, pointed to the station canteen and said, "Auntie, let's go get something to eat." As he spoke, he picked up his small bag and my small suitcase and walked away. I nodded to the woman and followed him away.</p>
<p>We had originally discussed that from now on, Hu Di would call me elder sister, because I liked to call him younger brother Hu. But Hu Di was afraid that his mother would scold him when he went home, so he firmly refused. Even if he didn't call "Auntie Ji," he had to call "Auntie," eldest auntie, second auntie, third auntie. Later, he said that I was too young to be his mother, so he called me little auntie. At this time, he elbowed me with his hand, knowing that he must have seen something, so I had no choice but to ignore the woman.</p>
<p>We really sat down in the station canteen. Although we had eaten breakfast at the headquarters in the morning, we were afraid of being delayed, so we didn't feel like eating. At this time, the car hadn't come, so we wanted to make up for it. As for Hu Di, he could eat at any time, except when he was sound asleep, 24 hours a day, and he could eat non-stop.</p>
<p>We were just asking the waiter for some refreshments, and the waiter, while answering,  looked out the window. I followed him and looked out, but didn't see anything, only as if a figure flickered outside the window. The waiter left, and there were only  people in the canteen; although there were two or three  , they were standing far away. I then asked Hu Di "what's going on." Hu Di  told me that he hadn't guessed wrong at all, that the woman was good at cheating and wasn't  , and sure enough, when we came over, she also came to spy outside the window.</p>
<p>I admire Hu Di's ability to pay attention to everything, and he's not much worse than me, who has received special training. Originally, when that fellow walked over at first, I already felt that she was a bit off. Her clothes and dress probably hadn't undergone formal training, and she violated a basic taboo in detective disguise—uniformity—in other words, all disguise clothes must be consistent with one's own appearance, habits, movements, and other items. Therefore, detective disguise says; "Rather than disguise, if you can't achieve uniformity, it's better to be natural; therefore, unless it's absolutely necessary, and the attainment is quite deep, it's better to be natural." In other words, after disguising, you really have to take care of everything, and there can't be a single place that isn't uniform.</p>
<p>Who said that this fellow was dressed as a countrywoman, her hands were so tender, her nails and palm lines were so clean, that she hardly touched water except for washing her face. That kind of maintenance achievement was obviously there; the rest, such as the agility and sharpness of her eyes, the oily and tidy hair, the deliberate affectation of her actions, etc., were some countrywoman's means, simply like the imitation actions on the theatrical stage, so there was no need to observe more carefully.</p>
<p>According to my original intention, I wanted to joke with her, at least I should be indifferent and deal with it as it comes. Because when you encounter this kind of person, it's best to let it happen naturally; otherwise, any  movement or avoidance will instead prove it to her. No  Hu Di  discovered  the strangeness, and was impatient to deal with  her. Fortunately, our movements were very natural, so there was no need to make a fuss about it. As for the fellow running outside the window to spy, it shows that her skills are ordinary. But  Hu Di said that he had seen her make gestures to the  waiter in front.</p>

<h3>Root of Life</h3>
<p>— Shaofu</p>
<p>General Feng Yuxiang has been assigned to the United States to investigate water conservancy. Before leaving, he wrote to Chairman Jiang, listing five points, the last of which said:</p>
<p>The moral climate is deteriorating, which is extremely dangerous. Many officials are corrupt, the administration is inefficient, the morale of the people is too low, and the culture is not developing. What is most obvious is the abandonment of military discipline and the decline of official norms. Today, officials deceive the people, and the military disturbs the people, doing whatever they want. Even in large cities, there are cases of police beating civilians, police fighting each other, and police clashing with each other everywhere. This is a matter of the root of life, which is not easy to cultivate in dozens or hundreds of years, but now it is swept away.</p>
<p>This passage is too painful. If we look through the newspapers of the past month, the many strike events of trams and buses in Shanghai can confirm that General Feng Yuxiang's words are based on ironclad facts.</p>
<p>General Feng calls himself a soldier. He came from the military and has decades of military life experience. He saw this situation and cried out "extremely dangerous," which is really serious!</p>
<p>The crux of the problem lies in education. Insufficient education makes it difficult for many people to understand reason. A smattering of knowledge is especially bad, because they will concoct a set of specious reasons to distort right and wrong. In addition to ignorance, there is also poverty. As the saying goes, extreme poverty leads to boredom. When a person is bored, what does he care about morality and law?</p>
<p>These are all social pathologies, and their impact will affect the whole. General Feng wrote to Chairman Jiang, asking him to "strive to prevent and correct them, in order to save them from the waves." I think we also have a responsibility. Everyone must be a do-gooder for morality and law, have the courage to sacrifice; and remove the incomplete self-concept of "don't care about the frost on other people's roofs."</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Thoughts on Current Affairs</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese in Dutch East Indies: A Tale of Blood and Tears</h3>
<p>— Foolish Old Man</p>
<p>— Seeing Off Special Envoy Li to the Dutch East Indies</p>
<p>Special Envoy Li Dijun to the Dutch East Indies has already departed on his journey. This is the first time the National Government has specially dispatched a high-ranking official to the Dutch East Indies. According to Mr. Li's statement to reporters before his departure, his mission is twofold: first, to offer spiritual comfort to the overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies; and second, to investigate the sufferings and oppression endured by the local overseas Chinese, providing information for the government's reference. For hundreds of years, the overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies have suffered from the dual oppression of foreigners and indigenous people, and from the unequal treatment of the Dutch authorities. From the "Red River Massacre" in 1740 to the "Tangkilong Massacre" after the victory, and more recently, the continuous news of the murder of overseas Chinese in places like Bagan, when this old debt is carefully calculated, it is truly a tale of blood and tears, an endless story of sorrow and bitterness!</p>
<p>The southward migration of overseas Chinese to the Dutch East Indies began during the Tang and Song dynasties. During Zheng He's seven voyages to the South Seas in the Ming Dynasty, overseas Chinese already had considerable influence in the Dutch East Indies. Later, Java and Sumatra were occupied by the Dutch. Due to the need for manpower for development, overseas Chinese were welcomed to go there. Thanks to the perseverance and hard work of the overseas Chinese, who focused on business, their numbers increased daily and they dominated the commercial world, which aroused the jealousy of the Dutch, who often mistreated them. Dutch officials were accustomed to extorting money from the overseas Chinese. The Dutch believed that those without legitimate occupations should be subjected to torture or even thrown into the sea. In the historically tragic "Red River Massacre," over 10,000 overseas Chinese died. In principle, the Chinese government should have urgently sought countermeasures to protect the safety of the overseas Chinese, but at the time, the Qing Emperor Qianlong declared: "Overseas Chinese are not subjects of the Great Qing, and the court will not intervene."</p>
<p>Abuse and Slaughter</p>
<p>Since the founding of the Republic of China, the indiscriminate massacre of overseas Chinese has been repeatedly recorded. In 1927, Cen Julin, the executive member of the Kuomintang East Borneo branch, and Deng Qianhuai, the chairman of the Shengwashengwa sub-branch, were unreasonably arrested by Dutch police. Overseas Chinese demanded their release from the Dutch authorities, but were instead shot at, resulting in dozens of casualties and numerous arrests. Afterward, the National Government protested to the Dutch government, but the Netherlands ignored it, instead deporting Cen and Deng and imprisoning more than ten overseas Chinese.</p>
<p>The massacres and discrimination suffered by overseas Chinese were not only perpetrated by the Dutch. Local indigenous people, seeing that overseas Chinese had gained economic power, inevitably harbored resentment, and the Dutch further fueled the flames. As a result, the violence escalated. Acts of massacring overseas Chinese were frequently heard of, such as the famous "Kudus Massacre," in which eleven Chinese were killed, 500,000 guilders worth of property was looted, and nineteen houses were burned down. Afterward, the Dutch government did not compensate for the losses, and the Chinese consul was not allowed to interfere.</p>
<p>Since 1909, although China has had consuls stationed in various places in the Dutch East Indies, such as the approximate areas of swimming, cotton, and Padang, they had no diplomatic power to intervene and were merely symbolic. Moreover, the East Indies government had a "Chinese Affairs Department" that employed corrupt Chinese people to do evil, further exacerbating the suffering of the overseas Chinese!</p>
<p>Orphans Without a Mother</p>
<p>The regulations for overseas Chinese entering the Dutch East Indies were exceptionally harsh, and the procedures were extremely troublesome. First, they had to pay a so-called "population tax" of 100 guilders on the ship, find a guarantor, and obtain a "landing permit" before they could disembark. There were also procedures for guaranteeing wives and obtaining "Wang characters," which were so complicated that they made one's head spin. According to their "Entry and Residence Regulations," any overseas Chinese whom the Dutch government deemed "unable to make a living and support themselves" or "likely to endanger the law" could be arbitrarily refused entry. Mr. Cai Yuanpei was one such person who was denied entry under the pretext of "endangering public order."</p>
<p>There are as many as two million overseas Chinese residing in the Dutch East Indies, constituting a major part of the national life of the Dutch East Indies. Based on the principle of national self-determination, they, like the Indonesians, are masters of the Dutch East Indies, and they have lived there for hundreds of years. Calling themselves "overseas Chinese" is merely a matter of "politeness." Can such blatant bullying and discrimination be allowed to continue, leaving the overseas Chinese with no peace of mind?</p>
<p>This time, Mr. Li is going to the Dutch East Indies. The overseas Chinese there have suffered deeply from the ravages of war, and after the war, they were subjected to anti-Chinese massacres in Indonesia. There is certainly a need for a special envoy to offer comfort. It is hoped that after investigating the various sufferings endured by the overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies, Mr. Li will report to the government and promptly implement policies to protect the overseas Chinese, abolish all unequal treaties against the overseas Chinese, and guarantee the safety and freedom of the overseas Chinese!</p>

<h3>Letter from a Lolo Compatriot</h3>
<p>— Li Li Arun</p>
<p>(Editor's note: After publishing Mr. Yi He's article "About the Lolo" on the 2nd, a Lolo compatriot, "Li Li Arun," believes that the section describing the Lolo killing Han compatriots is inaccurate. Based on the enthusiasm for unity, he submitted a letter to this publication, defending his people. We greatly cherish the enthusiasm of this Lolo compatriot and are publishing the original letter. However, we have reserved the overly critical parts of the letter directed towards the original author, because we hope that there will be no estrangement between our Lolo compatriots and us. Furthermore, we admire this Lolo youth for writing such fluent Chinese. With only a few minor adjustments, most of the text is from the original submission.)</p>
<p>Mr. Yi He:</p>
<p>I have seen two things about the Yi and Miao ethnic groups of the Southwest in the Shen Bao newspaper; one, there are conflicts between the Lolo tribes, and two, about the "Lolo" (published in Freedom Talk).</p>
<p>Not So Much</p>
<p>The first matter you did not mention, and it is irrelevant to this article, so we need not waste paper on it. Let us first discuss the second matter! You said, "The Lolo" take pride in killing Han people, and even use the heads of elderly Han people for sacrifices. I think this is a misunderstanding. (Omission) Although those with insufficient knowledge are somewhat barbaric, even the most uncivilized ethnic group in the world today, I think, would not be so unreasonable as that. Furthermore, since God brought me into this world into a Yi and Miao family, and I have lived in Yi and Miao areas for more than ten years, I have never seen such actions, nor have I heard of such rumors. Moreover, the Dragon Boat Festival is the only day of the year for Yi and Miao youths to express their love, which is a custom that differs from the Han people's and is superior to Western romance, because it does not cause young people to waste time or money on love. This is a sacred expression of chaste love. Except for the New Year and the Dragon Boat Festival, young men and women are all engaged in their respective duties, doing their best for humanity. The New Year is also a time for the year-long laborers to rest their muscles and bodies, so how can they have the patience to commit murder? As for young Han men being captured and becoming male spouses in the Yi and Miao areas, that is even more absurd and laughable. If this is what you have seen and heard yourself, then perhaps you are old and senile, and your mind is deranged, and your eyes are blind!</p>
<p>Now let me tell you some general information about our Yi and Miao people:</p>
<p>It can be said that our Yi and Miao people are worthy of the country, and how is that? Once I explain it, everyone will understand. The Yi and Miao people all live in mountainous areas, such as western Hunan, the entirety of Guizhou, the entirety of Ning County in Xikang, the entirety of Guangxi, northern Guangdong, and along the northwest and southwest to Hainan Island, western Sichuan, the entirety of Yunnan, southwestern Hubei, northern Fujian, and far abroad in northern Burma and northern Vietnam. Is that not where mountainous areas are located? However, they pay rent and taxes as usual, and perhaps even more than the Han people! As for military service, it is no exception.</p>
<p>A Heartfelt Loyalty</p>
<p>Despite this, the Yi and Miao people have never complained or protested. On the contrary, the Yi and Miao people all have a heartfelt loyalty to the country. I can also tell you that among the Yi and Miao youths in the Southwest, many have already graduated from university, many have graduated from high school, and many more are about to graduate; but none of them want to enter officialdom, and all of them are returning to do practical work. Running schools and reclaiming land are their consistent desires. But there are also many who have never seen a book or recognized a single word. There are even some who have studied diligently at missionary schools and dropped out after elementary school, middle school, or high school.</p>
<p>In recent years, I have only heard of the work of pacifying the Yi in the southwestern frontier, but there has been a lack of educational experimentation. (Omission) In short, the Yi and Miao youths are living in dire straits. Some of them have obtained elementary school, middle school, or high school degrees through part-time work and study, but few can actually pursue further studies, and they eventually go back to holding hoes, enduring all the warmth and coldness and contempt of life, and have never seen a glimmer of sympathy. Although the Founding Father personally stipulated that all ethnic groups within the country are equal, but that equality, in your article, although in the latter part it makes me very dissatisfied and angry, but because of the word "Lolo" you make such a defense, and appeal "do not discriminate against us" I dare to represent the Yi and Miao youths to thank you, and to guarantee to you and the elders of the whole country, as long as all ethnic groups in the country are equal, truly equal, in politics, economics, military, and in any aspect. The Yi and Miao youths are absolutely good citizens and good people of the country, if you do not believe me, please wait and see for yourselves for the arrival of true equality and see how it is? With this, I wish you peace. From the Yi and Miao youth Li Li Arun</p>
<h3>How Roosevelt Dealt with Stalin (1)</h3>
<p>— Written by Frances Perkins, Translated by Ge Chunliang</p>
<p>(Note: This was written by a woman who worked with Roosevelt for thirty-five years. She was very close to him as a political colleague, a state government official, and a member of Congress. In this chapter, she narrates how Roosevelt won Stalin's heart.)</p>
<p>Franklin Roosevelt was not an ordinary person. The simple virtue that creates greatness and nobility was not all that he possessed. He was the most complex person I have ever known. In his complex nature, there was a strength that enabled him to advance on the path to creating great achievements, and there was an inexhaustible compassion that made him like those diverse people of different races, and at the same time, he was liked by them. There was also the ability to temporarily forget his many problems while watching a play or resting, and there was also the strength to constantly struggle in contradictions, which often made those who worked with him, those who hoped that he would have pre-science and an unwavering will, feel very confused. However, this complexity of nature gave him the insight and ideals to delve into the life experiences of those diverse people of different races, and even, in his later life, he took the physical, social, geographical, economic, and military conditions of those different races as his own responsibility.</p>
<p>One of the best examples to describe his talent is his meeting with Marshal Stalin at the Tehran Conference. The Russians intrigued and intrigued Roosevelt. He was unable to talk to the servants who came and went in the house. They served very thoughtfully, worked very diligently, and often smiled happily and temptingly, but they did not speak, not a single word. He still liked them very much.</p>
<p>He set out to like Stalin and was determined to make himself liked as well. When I wanted to discuss a particular piece of legislation in Congress with him, he told me the story of his encounter with Stalin. When I was talking about the legislation, his eyes were thoughtful, and his mind seemed to be elsewhere. He said 'Um! Um!'</p>
<p>Later, suddenly he turned his head, a common gesture of his, and said what he was thinking: 'You should know that the Russians are very interesting people. In the first three days, I made not a shred of progress. I simply could not get any private contact with Stalin, although I did everything he asked me to do. I lived in his embassy, attended his banquets, and was introduced to his ministers and generals. He is a precise, strong, and solemn man, but he doesn't smile often, and there is no human warmth that I can grasp.' (To be continued)</p>
<p>News Figures</p>
<h3>Sun Ke, the Peace Advocate, the Political Commentator Who Rarely Speaks</h3>
<p>— Zheng Fan</p>
<p>'When Hu Zhantang receives guests, only he speaks, and you don't. When ××× receives guests, he speaks as much as you do. Only Mr. Sun Zhesheng coldly faces guests, and if you don't speak, he doesn't speak either.' This was a very popular saying among reporters more than a decade ago. Mr. Sun Ke was originally a man of few words. He was always so quiet that the guests had to shut their mouths. However, due to various interactions and contacts, Mr. Sun is now an eloquent political commentator, although he may still not be very adept at greetings and pleasantries.</p>
<p>Sun's student days were entirely American-style education. He studied in Hawaii as a child. In the early years of the Republic of China, he studied in the United States at government expense, entered the University of California, graduated, and then entered Columbia University to study political and economic science, earning a master's degree. He excelled in his studies at school and was the president of the Chinese Students Association in the United States, assisting the Founding Father in promoting the revolution overseas with great effort. When he returned to China in 1917, he was not very familiar with Chinese. Therefore, some people have said: 'Mr. Gu Mengyu does not eat Chinese food, and Mr. Sun Zhesheng does not write Chinese characters.' When Sun was the mayor of Guangzhou and the Minister of Railways, he still signed official documents with a pen. Later, a friend advised him to use a brush to write, and he imitated the Founding Father's calligraphy and began to practice, and he actually learned it very similarly. From then on, he became very interested in brush calligraphy, often writing inscriptions for others, writing couplets, and writing epitaphs for people. If you compare Sun's signature-style "Sun" character with the Founding Father's signature-style "Sun" character, you will see that they are exactly the same.</p>
<p>Reporter Origin</p>
<p>There are countless leading figures in the party and the country who come from the journalism field, such as Yu Youren, Shao Lizi, Dai Jitao, Yu Jingheng, and Chen Bulei. Sun also worked as a newspaper reporter. That was when he had just returned to China. He was the editor-in-chief of the Guangzhou Times and wrote many articles.</p>
<p>Sun is currently fifty-six years old, three years older than the Founding Father's wife, Ms. Soong Ching-ling. He has also been the Speaker of the Legislative Yuan for more than ten years, and his political achievements are beyond description. He has written many books, and his articles are also scattered in newspapers and magazines. His theories are extremely pertinent, and his research on Sino-Soviet relations is very in-depth. He has always advocated "Sino-Soviet friendship and cooperation." He is the president of the Sino-Soviet Cultural Association.</p>
<p>Very Like His Father</p>
<p>Sun's personality is similar to his father's in several ways. Everyone knows that the Founding Father's two great hobbies in life were "revolution and reading." In addition to engaging in revolution and construction, Sun's greatest hobby is "reading." In his private residence, there is an elegant and pleasant study with the inscription "Buzuzhai" (Insufficient Studio) by Mr. Wu Zhihui. There is also a couplet: "Cultivate the spirit of integrity, read useful books." He has a very rich collection of books on international issues, political parties, politics, economics, and society. In addition to reading, horseback riding, swimming, visiting scenic spots, and collecting calligraphy and paintings are also his secondary hobbies.</p>
<p>Not long ago, Sun celebrated the birthday of his birth mother, Madam Lu. Madam Lu is now eighty years old and still in good health. Sun is more irritable, but he is very accommodating to Madam Lu.</p>
<p>In today's world of widespread war, Sun is one of the most ardent advocates of peace. Recently, the leaders of the Third Force in Shanghai invited Sun to come forward and mediate the situation, and Sun has reluctantly agreed. I hope that Sun will do his best to make the greatest effort for peace!</p>
