<p>增加國庫收入　解決勞資糾紛</p>
<p>〔合衆社重慶十七日電〕二中全會今日採取革命性之斷然措置，以解決中國目前之經濟危局。行政院長宋子文謂，此項捐置將遭遇多方之反對，但目前情勢迫切，不得不採取强硬步驟也。該項措置之用意，在遏止通貨膨賬，增加國庫收入，解決勞資糾紛，並調整公務員，軍人及其他政府工作人員之薪給，使與物價配合。該項決議包括下列數點：（一）根據三民主義節制資本與平均地權之主張，規定增設財產稅，特種過份利得稅及股票交易稅，此項新稅均挅累進制，財產稅即行開征。（二）組織勞資糾紛仲裁委員會。其決議由政府施行，倘仲裁不能成立，政府得接管該企業，國營事業員工視作公務員，不準罷工。（三）薪給每三月調整一次，以物價指數爲依據，百分數之增加與底薪成反比例。軍人餉給將酌予提高，但在整軍計劃完成以前，不致提高至與公務員水準相同。（四）要求共產黨停止發行鈔票，促成中國之幣制統一。</p>
<p>〔中央社重慶十七日電」二中全會今晨開十九次大會，修正通過地方行政報吿決議案，關於充實地方財力者，辦法與密查案稍有變更，土地稅收入省市佔百分之二十，縣市佔百分之五十，中央佔百分之三十，院辖市土地稅之收人，院轄市佔百分之六十，中央佔百分之四十。</p>

<p>〔中央社重慶十七日電〕二中全會閉幕時，蔣總裁致閉幕詞，　謂：今天全會閉幕，我們對於內政。外交各項問題，都有了切實的次議，本黨今後努力的方針，也已經詳載於宣言，我們今後以最大多數的黨領導建國，應該如何努力自强，實行三民主義，爲國家與人民謀永久的幸福，我已迭次對各位有所說明，不必　述。今天所要特別提出的，就是現在的時代已完全不同於五年前或十年前的時代，這一次大戰的結果，使全世界人民都感覺到和平之可貴，惟有發揮正義和平。互信互助的力量，纔能防止侵略主義者的再起。任何一國的安危治亂，都與全世界的禍福息息相關，全世界的和平，寄託於所有國家的和平，而任何一國的安全，都必須於全世界的和平中求之。我們中國抗戰最久，受戰爭的痛苦也最深，所以我們在抗戰結束以後，就決定了中國必須採取和平統一的道路，國內任何問題，必以互諒互讓的精神，謀取解決，以達和平統一的目的。這平年來，政府一切的措施，都依照這個政策而行，政治協商會議的舉行，停止衝突恢復交通命令的頒布，軍事調處執行部的成立，以及軍事三人小組關於整編與統編方案的議定，都足以證明我們不辭任何犧牲，不惜任何忍讓，以求得國家和平統一的苦心，我們今後仍將一秉初衷，力求其貫澈執行，這中間，我要特別提到馬歇爾將軍的貢獻，馬將軍來到我們中國三個月間，始終不懈的工作，是完全以盟友資格，誠心誠意來協助我們中國的和平統一，使我國能走上和平建國的道路，以貢獻於太平洋和平，乃至世界的利平。他們這個主張，是與我國的政策適相符合的，他是完全用客觀的立塲，審愼的考慮，與我們共同尋求解決的途徑，他以公平而切實的主張，克服了不少的困難，我們對他的苦心與誠意，十分感佩，十分信任。我們的盟友，對中國的和平統一，尙且如此熱心關切，何况我們中國自已的同胞，當然應該捐棄任何的成見，顧全整個中國的前途，貫澈我們和平統一的目的。我希望中國共產然，能與我們政府一樣的眞誠接受盟邦友人的一片好意，對於議定的方案，忠實履行，勿作規外的行動，勿生意外的枝節，那我相信馬歇爾將軍的使命一定可以如期成功的。我們要知道，這不僅是馬歇爾將軍的成功，是美國杜魯門總統政策的成功，亦就是我們政府和平統一政策的成功，我們認爲這個政策的成敗，其關係是整個的，各位特別注意此點，因之，我們大家必須推誠置信，相忍爲國，務使當前任　　何難題能够得到眞正的解次，爲國家早闢和平建設的坦途。</p>

<h3 id="c5">宣言全文 <a href="#c5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>〔中央社重慶十七日電〕中國國民黨第六屆中央執行委員會第二次全體會議宣言，全文如次：抗戰的勝利，已經在本黨第六次全國代表大會以後得到了，這使我們踏進了和平建國的新階段，本會議舉行於這個重要的時期，要首先提出和平建國是我們全黨和全國努力的目的。在第一次世界戰以後，本是實行總理建國方略的時機。可是在帝制遺孽和割據軍閥手裏鉛過了，現在當第二次世界磊戰以後，我們經過了八年的血戰，排除了日本侵略的障碍，得到了千載一時的建國良機，我們斷不能再有錯過我們爲保持勝利的戰果，必須把握住這個歷史的關鍵，本會議爲求得舉國一致的協力，特列舉下列各點，以告我全國同胞：</p>
<p>第一·要安定社會，恢復秩序，完成復員計劃，以及和平建國的工作。要建國必須安定，安定必須和平，這是互相關聯的，我們面對着八年抗戰後的瘡痍滿目，經歷了半年來復員工作所遭遇的種種障碍和困難，目覩各地同胞痛苦的待救濟，流離的待還鄕，失業的待復業，被壓迫的待解放，確認我們國內不應該再有擾攘紛爭的現象，各地方也不應該再有秩序紊亂的現象，惟有符合我們國家和人民的需要，纔不負本黨努力奮鬥的目的。政府這半年來，多方忍讓，以求復員工作的進行，本會議認爲是正確的措施，政府所以委曲求全，在國民大會召集以前，召集國內各黨派和社會人士共同協商，也就是為要獲得安定和平的環境，以利建國工作的推行，這對於本黨所定的建國秩序容有變更，但是本黨爲國爲民的精神，當爲全國同胞所共知。我們要貫澈這種精神，不惜任何犧牲，以求得復員計劃迅速的完成。</p>
<p>第二，要如期召集國民大會，還政於民，以達成我們實施憲權的素願，本黨領導國民革命的目的，在於建立民國，實現三民主義。民主政治實在是本黨革命奮鬥的主要目標，遠在五十年前，興中會已經明白宣示，本黨的革命歷史，就是爲中國創造民主的歷史，如果沒有暴日的侵略和國</p>
<h3 id="c6">參政會後日揭幕　本屆會期決定為十四天 <a href="#c6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>〔本報重慶十七日電〕參政會決定廿日假軍事委會大禮堂揭幕，昨日起開始報到，一日間報到者已有八十七名，本日仍有繼續報到者留滬參政員黃炎培，陶百川，端木愷，劉百閔，留蓉參政員李幼春，吳貽芳，邵從恩等數十人，均定廿五日專機來渝出席。本屆會期爲十四日自廿日起至下月二日止，必要時得延長之，定十八日午後三時舉行茶會交換意見</p>
<p>〔聯合社重慶十七日電〕參政會定廿日開幕，討論內政外交諸問題，並向政府供獻意見。</p>
<p>〔聯合社南京十七日電〕據參政員披露，本屆參政會議，將以物價，政府改組及東北局勢爲討論主題。內的軍事阻碍，憲政早已按着規定實行，本黨歷次的決議和本黨總裁歷年來的宣示，無不表示我們早日實施憲政的決心。政府雖在軍事緊張的期間，也從未疏忽對於實施憲政的準備，我們迫切的期望，在還政于民，而召集國民大會，是還政于民秘經的途徑，五月五日召開國民大會，政府已明令宣布，我們一定要如期舉行。</p>
<p>第三，要說明我們對于貫澈致治協商會議決議的誠意與堅持五權憲法的決心，我們對於政治協商會議的各項協議，經過了詳密而鄭重的檢討，我們鑒於國內和平安定與精誠團結的必要，以及同胞痛苦的必須解除，國家基礎的必須穩定，對於政治協商會議各項協議，都願以最大的誠意與各黨派及社會人士精誠相與，協力一致，以促其實行。但是我們所必須堅持的，就是憲法草案的修正，必須符合於五權憲法的遺敎，這因爲三民主義與五權憲法是不可分割的，放棄了五權憲法，則三民主義便不能完全實現。總理在政治制度上這一個偉大精深的發明，是借鑒於歐美的憲法，斟酌我們的國情，爲國家立長治久安的根本，今後我們國家政治組織的健全與鞏固，需要有一部完善可行的憲法，如果憲法的內容違背了五權憲法，在實際行使的時候扞格難通，必致陷國家於不利，所以本然對於五權憲法必當遵奉保持，終始無間，這實在是爲着國家久遠的利害，希望各黨派和社會人士明瞭我們的立塲，了解我們的主張。〔未完〕</p>

<p>〔中央社華盛頓十六日電〕馬歇爾元帥本日於國務院舉行之大規模記者招待會中，發表渠以杜魯門總統駐華特使之資格，作在華三月之一般報吿，申述渠已完成之工作，並列舉渠再度返中國後，將予致力之若干重要問題。渠即席報吿渠在華工作及中國之近况，允許認者直接引述。記者繼之提出若干詢問，均欲獲悉中蘇美蘇關係，及中國燕北現局之詳情，馬帥對各記者所提問題，均予以直接謙遜及外交方式之答覆。馬帥之聲明全文如下：</p>
<p>完成民主國家</p>
<p>中國人民今日正從事努力，自余視之此項努力，實應獲得全世界之合作，此種努力，幾無前例，中國人民之領袖，刻逐日致力于和平討論解決過去廿年中失和而痛苦之衝突，逐日均獲進展，彼等現已順利結束過去廿年之敵對情况，彼等已商獲協議，現正努力復員，從事統編軍隊爲國軍，彼等已同意完成本國政治及經濟進步之基本原則，而西方民主國家完成此類進步，則係以若干世紀之時間始得之。吾人如欲獲得和平「世界如欲獲得和平」，則中國目前努力必需成功，實有迫切之理由。</p>
<p>有賴其他國家</p>
<p>中國努力之成功，大部份有賴于其他國家之行動，中國如被忽視，或如遭遇妨碍其統一發展及目前願望之企圖，彼等之努力，定將失敗，余信美國於此最能予中國以協助。余深信美國人民對於中國表示同情之關切，吾人於太平洋繼續維持和平，中國目前致力促進團結及經濟穩定努力之成功，對於美國民極爲重要。余不信任何國家有理由猜疑，吾人在中國之動機吾人不要求獲得經濟，以及類此方面之任何特殊利益，吾人對本身之友誼，不索取任何代價，中國之穩定政府，對吾人有重要關係。今後數月，對於中國人民極爲重要，僉信對於未來世界和平，亦極重要。亞洲各穩定政府之建立，對於吾人極爲重要。</p>
<p>北平軍調處部</p>
<p>余在華之短期間內，情形實極複雜，首受美國太平洋區軍隊之騷擾，後復受中國東北嚴重局勢之影響，雖有諸此困難，余信已獲極大進步。並願君等對吾人所稱執行總部設於北平之組織，稍獲有瞭解，此乃吾人於目前在中國所有之最重要工具。彼等組織若干小組，分赴中國各危急地帶，實行各項協議之具體命令，而藉此傳達至發生糾紛地點，不論爲戰鬥行爲，或恢復交通，或令某城解圍，或遣送日人，以及即將推行之縮軍，改編，及統一中國所有武裝部隊，莫不由此種小組執行。</p>
<p>苟無調處執行總部，吾人將一無成就，調處執行總部，對於實施軍事協定，包括交通，至爲重要。　在余留華之最後一個晚上，直至離余動身前之十分鐘，我等尙在關於遣派執行小組前往東北作成協定，須知各地無線電交通缺乏，在此等長距離之孤立地區中，幾無公路交通可言。傳遞命令，非常困難。余竟須旅行三千五百英里之遙，前往尙有糾紛之主要地區。在東九省內迄今尙無執行總部之代表，該處情形變動甚速，軍隊到處調動，當然難免各種小衝突，此等軍隊，尤其在共黨方面，幾不知吾等已成立協定，因此，吾人必須速即派執行小組前往東北，此等執行小組之服務，確屬難能可貴，彼等不但在極困難之情形下工作，而且冒極大之危險，余願重言，若無吾人在北平所設之調處執行部，則吾人實無法實行此等協定。　余在日本進見麥克阿瑟將軍，與渠討論華軍參加佔領之事，麥帥極表歡迎，余想蔣主席不久將發表關於此事之公吿。</p>
<p>答覆記者問話</p>
<p>在問答時，馬歇爾稱：（一）東北情勢極端嚴重，（二）彼即將返華，但確實日期未定，（三）糧荒問題嚴重，將近饑饉程度，（四）中國極需交通器材及工廠之機械設備，（五）對華財政援助，非常複雜，但極需要，美國應以財政援助，優先給予中國。馬歇爾對所謂之（內蒙）問題，拒作評論，謂對此情勢不熟悉，對中國共產黨之定義及其理想，亦拒加評論。彼復宣佈中國軍隊正待三五〇師縮編爲五〇師，並稱此爲「巨大之復員」。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十六日電〕杜魯鬥總統駐華特使馬歇爾今日在此間招待記者，發表在華觀感稱：東北局勢「千鈞一髮」，國軍二百五十師，其中受美式訓練者三十九師，正陸續開往該處，此項美式部隊前會在緬甸方面作戰。</p>

<p>自外匯市塲開放以來，最爲一般人所屬目的，有下列幾件事：一，中央對於外匯，雖沒有規定固定的比率，但成竹在胸，自有其一定的目標。這目標究竟如何？是否還要提高，高到如何程度？倘或撳低，低到如何程度？日前爲了遠期較高的事實，曾經哄動了外匯市塲，投機市塲，乃至整個市塲，可見一般人關懷的深切。二，與外匯同時開放的，爲黃金市塲。中央銀行，自本月八日以來，不斷配售，總數已達二千八百五十一條，因而吸進的法幣，已達四十七萬萬元以上。本埠黃金的市價，已得到相當的穩定。假如本埠外埠，大量買進，大量流出，不知是否繼續配售？是否無限制准予登　？過去情形，似乎祇有配售，還沒有買進，假如金價低落，是吾照市收進？換句話說：中央銀行有沒有意思，把金價穩定在某一個水準上？又用金條換得的法幣，是否眞正回龍？抑或左手進來，右手依舊出去？與通貨的調節或緊縮上，究竟有沒有關係？</p>
<p>三，緊隨着匯市開放的，便是對外貿易問題。因爲國內外物價距離得太遠；按照現時匯價，似乎出口業還得不到相當的和普遍的鼓勵，而且美元又在鬧着要貶值，不知將來的匯價，會不會進一步，加以適當的調整？至於進口貨物，情形適得其反。一切定貨，非常熱閙。據傳美國染料的進本，比本埠市價，要便宜到五分之四！美元如果貶值，其成本益發要减輕了。這在物資的供應方而，常然可以獲得相當的補救，從而國內的高物價，亦可望收到若干冲淡的功效。所成爲問題的，就是許多生產事業，不堪壓迫，已遭遇到非常困難的苦境。有些工廠，已經結束了，有些正在謀脫手。大後方工廠整批停閉的現象，在這裏究竟能否避免？</p>
<p>以上這些問題，（一）（二）兩項，只好讓當局拿事實來解答。第（三）項，形勢愈趨愈嚴重。倘或沒有補救的方法，似乎勝利後，後方經濟界騷動的情形，與工業界不景氣的現象，很可能地會迅速發現。然則如何加以補救？我們認爲這問題太複雜，應從多方面下手。例如：</p>
<p>（一）需要許可的進口貨物，中央原已特設機關，專司其事，從嚴從寬，自可斟酌需要，加以適當的調節。</p>
<p>（二）自由進口的貨物，在進口時，原無須經過許可。但頭寸的來源，仍在中央銀行。頭寸扣緊，一切不必要的來源，未嘗不可以節制。</p>
<p>（三）敵偽物資中原料部份，據說：非常之多，早有一部份已經配售出來。關於配售情形，如果放棄，待時而沽的策略，即改變單純的收入主義，而以扶助生產爲方針，把售價儘量抑低，使廠家有低廉的原料可得，那末，於國貨工廠的競爭上，生存上，便可增加不少的助力。</p>
<p>（四）有許多物資，原被敵僞刦奪去的，應當迅速地儘量發還，不可多兜圈子，使人可望而不可即。尤其是事實上十分明顯的商家貨物，例如强迫收買的紗布，敵僞還沒有處分掉的，不論已搬動，未搬動，易辨認，或不易辨認，應常依照批准的原案，迅予全部發還，爲刦後商民稍蘇喘息，不司掯住不放，加深了他們的痛苦。須知這是商民的物資，不是敵偽的物資。已處分的，尙許提請索償，未處分的，何可加以沒收，重行處分？</p>
<p>（五）許多輕工業，現在多收歸國營，其唯一的理由，是在帮助他們，恢復生產，並非與民爭利。這個理由，政府早已信誓旦且，向民衆聲明過了。那末，沒有收歸國營的工廠，旣在極度困難之中，是否應當本此原則，分別加以實質上的援助？我們認爲予以貸款，也好，供給原料，也好，减稅免稅，也好，替他們解除運輸上，動力上的困難，也好。總而言之：要兌現，不單要口惠。</p>
<p>最重要的，尤在於廠家的自覺與自助。抗戰期間，以來源斷絕，需要孔殷之故，一切粗製濫造的低次貨品，都可以得到廣泛的銷路，與豐厚的利潤，這原是反常的現象。市靠囤積，投機來增加利潤，尤其是可暫而不可久的手段。便是上面所舉種種外來的補助，也都是臨時性質，不可視同經常。所以管理上，技術上，推銷上，凡是與營業上生產上有關係的，統應該力圖改善，精益求精，務使自身立於不敗的地位，方才可久可大，達到眞正工業化的目的。</p>
<p>我國的工業，原以工價抵廉，爲有利條件之一。但以物價不斷上漲之故，工資亦不斷增加。有人估計：照現在的匯價來計算，有許多工資，比美國工資，早已有過之而無不及。那末，這個有利條件，也要漸漸地消失了。倘或那些鬆懈，散漫，冗濫，浪費的作風，繼續存在，不加整飭，前途如何，實堪隱憂。</p>

<p>〔聯合社華盛頓士六日電〔原子彈實騐五月間將在中太平洋比基尼珊瑚島附近舉行，美國人士頗懼此項實騐有殃及世界其他地區之虞。原子彈製造工程主持人葛羅夫斯少將今日特發表地麥學家（支加哥大學田拉博士及康耐爾大學貝斯博士）宣言，以袪除恐懼，安定人心。宣言如下：「原子彈無論在近水面處，水面上，或在水面下爆炸，僅于就地發表局部擾亂，恰與大量尋常炸藥相同，此種爆炸并不足以使海水發生放射性蛻變，否則，此種蛻變自行繼續不歇，將造成地球之原子性爆炸，吾人於此曾細加推考，首先，水中所含原素已知其亦充斥於各屋球之中，苟星球上有高速度連鎖作用，則星球將爆裂而自行消滅，但星球上並無此種現象。由此可知在海水中亦然。其次，原子彈中遲純物質之成份亦佔不少，因此近炸彈處海水溫度的在一百萬度左右，較之星球腹部溫度約二百萬度以上，相去甚遠故水中所發生情况恰與距星球中心極遠地點相似。科學家咸知原子核作用即在溫度一百萬度，尙不足以抵補輻射損失，使其繼續不已，原子彈在中太平洋爆炸，亦決不至於發生連鎖作用，使海洋蒸發或地球爆裂。是以吾人確信原子彈在水面下爆炸不致發生自行繼續之運鎖作用。就原子彈現有形式而言，此確係實情，苟原子彈別含敏銳物質，則在施放時尙需三思，蓋水中溫度或將因此更高」云。</p>

<p>行總浙閩分署長來滬請款搶修</p>
<p>目前而臨於我江浙兩省最嚴重之問題，爲八年失修之錢塘海塘，在七堡等地已崩潰成災。近似春汛潮漲，其餘各堡亦岌岌可危，水勢可能冲至長興，而將滬杭路切斷。此海塘之安危，非特浙屬杭嘉湖一帶生靈有關，即蘇屬蘇常松太等各縣，亦共受影響，關係整個東南人民之生存。如於秋汛前不搶修完成，其後患將不堪設想。水利專家錢江大橋總工程師茅以昇及自美來華視察災情之聯總秘書長蒙納，東南宣慰使鈕永鍵等，於最近相繼前往視察，見此險象環生之海塘，均抱極大隱憂。中央雖已撥款六千萬元搶修海寗險塘，但與事實所需，尙相去極遠。行總浙閩分署署長孫曉樓，乃於前日</p>
<p>又據孫氏談：本署包括浙閩兩省，浙江省共七十七縣市，祗六縣未遭敵人擾殺，如長興武康蕭山等三十八縣市，爲敵長期盤踞，房屋損失有七十萬二千九百間。現有二千萬人民無衣無食，流浪他鄕。又如福建省，亦有廈門等七縣市全部淪陷，部份淪陷者，有連江等十三縣。該分署現正設法積極救濟云。</p>

<p>— 本報記者惺吾</p>
<p>上海到杭州四小時比特快車還要快</p>
<p>輕盈流利一點鐘百哩行程　整潔華美遊覽車名符其實</p>
<p>宣傳已留下的新式汽油火車，昨日在滬杭綫作處女行駛。北站總站長童士達氏，爲要主持開車禮，所以來得特別早。運務處侯處長·關副處長·歐陽秩段長·及由杭州特地趕來的黎松柏段長，以及兩路各部各處的高級人員，把站長室擠滿了。林孝錦站長忙着打電話，催促這望眼欲穿的「西湖號一出來。一次，二次，直到七點五十五分，才姍珊到站。</p>
<p>三輛紫色流綫型的「遊覽車」，隨着一股强烈的汽汕味，出現在人們眼前，立刻引起了騷動，忙壞了童總站長。這裏要向他請示，那邊要求他解釋。還要抽功夫，陪着記者們參觀。他說：這是從華鐵接收下來之汽汕客車，現在已經政裝整新，修理完竣的共有四輛，暫以三輛組成一列，每逢星期一·三·五行駛上北無錫間，當日往返一次，定名爲「太湖號」。每逢星期二·四·六日行駛上北杭州間，沿途祇停嘉興·蘇州·各一次。</p>
<p>汽油火車每小時速率可行一百哩，因無需加水加煤等麻煩，開行也極簡易，所以四個鐘頭另五分可以到杭州，比特快車還快上五十五分鐘。每輛車子有一具引擎，前後兩端都裝着與汽車相似的開動機。如要倒退行駛，可以不必掉頭。</p>
<p>昨日是第一日行駛，爲謹愼起見，每輛備有兩各司機。八時二十五分，一聲汽笛，火車徐徐動了。記者爲要實地採訪，所以隨車出發。因爲第一次開行，知道的人還不多，又因天下雨，所以二百二十二個座位，竟空了三十二隻。一出北站，速度就快了。十二分鐘到西站，原定停兩分鐘，但昨天因爲侯處長。歐陽段長。等要下車，所以多停了四分鍾。</p>
<p>潔白的車廂，簇新柔軟的絲絨沙發，處處顯得華貴。車童殷勤地送開水和熱手巾，可以叫你忘記你是在車子裏。打開車窗，一陣油菜花香，久雨初霽，淸新的空氣，使人心曠神怡。蟄居於都市的人們，可設永遠享受不到這大自然的美景。</p>
<p>隨車的修理機匠汪阿小，不厭求詳的講解汽油火車的結構。八隻汽缸串連式排列着，具有一百五十匹馬力的動力。汽油的、消耗要視引擎的好壞而定。昨天的三個車輛中，GC1和GC3由上海至杭州，共用了一百十立托（約合三十加侖）汽油，而GC2却消耗了一百六十立托。大的每加侖汽油可供一個車子走四哩餘。可惜記者對此道是門外漢，不能更詳實的報吿。</p>
<p>最後要提到的，普通的車子總是閙着脫班，而昨天汽油火車却相反的閙「早到」。杭州回上海時，至嘉興早到了二十四分鍾，到西站又早了一刻。因爲時間是有規定的，所以祇好停在嘉興或西站等待。嘉興站的黃站長說：「開行時間扣準之後，立刻要調整的」。</p>

<p>曾犯案累累　林步武　原非好東西</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕霞飛路泰山公寓號屍案破案後，兇犯林步武轉　逃往蘇州·十六日淸晨卒被吳縣警局司法科偵緝隊在桃花塢有幢弄將其逮捕，前日由盧家灣分局派員往蘇將該犯迎提來滬。各情彙誌於次：</p>
<p>該案共犯王正中</p>
<p>自十二日在憶定盤路逸安坊弄內就擒後，林犯潛逃無蹤。當塲承辦警員即至二十七號林寓搜查，結果獲得照相百餘張，及通訊地址多處，由分局長趙佩瑾　俊厚詳加研究，結果斷定其逃京滬一帶無疑。當由趙分局長行文至崑山蘇州等處各警局，並附林之照相。吳縣警察局長楊槐春接得公函，諭令司法科科長田文宗轉令債緝隊隊長曹安昌，在各旅社嚴查往來旅客。十四日晚曹率幹警在　門外天然飯店翻閱循環簿時，瞥見載有旅客翁松泉者，頓起疑竇，乃嚴結侍者以翁之面貌及服裝等，並出示林之照相，經侍者認明即爲此人，但已不知去向。至此，各籌員知林確已來蘇。翌日黎明後，由曹隊長派警四出偵查，直至午後，經眼綫回隊報吿，得悉林及其妻</p>
<p>均隱匿于桃花塢</p>
<p>石幢弄卅七號其岳父許長根家（許爲金城飯店賑房）。至十六日黎明三時許，由曹率警按址前往，叩門數下，啓門者爲林之妻許洛雲。即問你丈夫可在？許答「在」已睡，便衣警等即一擁而入，其時林正在床熱睡，乃束手就擒。並在枕邊抄出新式三號左輪槍一支，子彈八粒已上腌。即帶回警局覊押，十六日上午十時盧家灣趙分局長接得蘇州楊局長長途電話通知後，是日下午由趙分局長飭刑事股代理股長薛敏傑便衣巡官倪家鳳。股員馬秉璋、警長張鈞等四人，帶同王妻王陸氏搭乘三時慢車往蘇迎提。七時餘抵蘇，面謁楊局長，躭　一宵。昨日上午，薛代股長曾有長途電話來滬，向趙分局長報吿經過情形，並認明確係林步武，午後二時半　特快車來滬。當時深恐該犯狡猾，在車中發生意外，故由警長張鈞共同連　，以免脫逃。該犯此時穿　靑棉袍，破棉褲，頭戴羅宋帽。</p>
<p>由蘇押登馬車時</p>
<p>林犯將羅宋帽拉下，蓋掩面部，僅露雙眼。蓋此案已哄動蘇垣，沿途觀者途爲之塞。迨抵北站後，載上警備車，直駛盧家灣分局。總局余副局長對此案甚爲重視，於四時許赴分局，該犯到局後，曾親自預審，諭令收押待查。據該犯供：十二日在滬西逃逸後，即至姚主敎路王正中家，携妻許洛雲步行至眞茹，當日搭火車至無錫，住一夜，再乘車至常州，亦躭擱一宵，十四日折回蘇州，　室天然飯店二〇九號房間。因閱報悉風聲緊張，翌晨即移居岳父處。原擬逗留一二日，再化裝他往。又據　副局長云：該犯前曾犯盜案多起，十五年前被判徒刑十年，且又曾參加僞組織熊劍東部下充任副官，實爲殺人不眨眼之惡魔。該犯於槍殺老七之佈置，亦有其聰慧周密之處，蓋以誘引一女子至過於僻靜區域，則</p>
<p>死者決不願隨往，則又易於敗露，故誘至泰山公寓四樓最高處槍殺，實爲一種「鬧中取靜」之穩妥方法，故得於事後從容逃逸。　局長又吿記者稱：該案發生後，接獲報吿時之時間，爲下午四時五十五分，待此案全部破獲，主犯林步武由蘇迎提回滬，時間亦爲下午四時五十五分，可云巧合。按此案轟動蘇滬，成爲街頭巷尾之談話資料，自案發以至結束，祗僅一星期，實可謂神速異常云。</p>

<p>希望地方當局速籌經費以維敎育</p>
<p>編輯先生：鄙人代表川沙縣小敎同人向貴報懇賜一角，代爲披露，我們淸苦得使人難以相信的待遇，本學期薪津一萬八千五百元，但是至今還未領到，去年只有二千另五十元，而且到了物價高漲的十二月底纔領到，十一·十二·一月·三個月還是遙遙無期。幸虧校方津貼六十斤米，所以能維持個人的膳食。我們爲國家社會及兒童學業着想，從未有怠敎罷敎的事，就因爲我們不怠敎罷敎政府當局就置若罔聞，主管當局，好像是等待罷工罷敎，如我們負了重大的職責，享受如此菲薄的待遇，你想是應該的嗎？比請撰安</p>
<p>（編者按）陳先生函述的實情，恐怕不僅川沙一縣如此，敢說各縣都有同樣情形，戰後政費無從寬籌，常然是事實，但復員後的地方當局，總得多方設法，敎育事業，關係重大，忍令淸苦的小敎同人，枵腹從公，實在太說不過去！我們希望各地方當局，急切設法，維持敎費，一面請小敎同人，從大處着想，勿生意外，以維護這神聖的敎育事業。</p>

<p>武吉生問　舍弟前年參加抗戰，不幸負傷，彈貫雙腿，自右腿入左腿出，當時即覺左腿下部失去知覺，不能轉動，時經醫診斷，始知右腿無礙，而左腿大腿骨被穿，稍下部震斷并創及神經，上夾板臥床者凡三月，一骨雖經接住，但不十分吻合，卸夾板後，膝部僵直，經一週之强壓，始能彎曲，踝部以下，仍無知覺，及不能轉動，故僅能以雙杖代步，日久膝部筋肉收縮，竟不能再度伸直，而肌肉亦日見消瘦。痛苦萬狀，懇示醫法。</p>
<p>張仲明醫師答：貴恙須先照X光片，以觀折斷之左腿骨接合成績如何，下腿部不能行動，無知覺，乃係肌肉多時不用而退化，或因局部神經受損，宜用按摩透熱機能物理治療，可能收效。</p>
<p>桑梓標問　家姊自去年春間，因身感痰乏，四肢無力，漸覺不支，即往四明醫院診治，據醫生診斷，乃初期肺結核症，須打空氣針，延至六月間，病勢忽累及腸部，食後腹瀉不止，而常作隱痛，時斷時續，送廣慈醫院住院求醫，五月來更形惡化，骨瘦如柴，寸步難行，請專科名醫，賜予良方，沒齒不忘。</p>
<p>張仲明醫師答：令姊所患係肺結核兼腸結核，須注重營獲，增加抵抗力，此外並無特效良藥。</p>
<p>盧守範問：敝人於五六年前忽患一種如濕疹類似之症，發於臀部，發時奇癢難熬，非用熱水燙不可，燙後皮膚變硬，抓破且出黃水，雖經打針服藥抹藥並照過Xp光電療數次，終不能瘉。據醫生云係皮膚細胞內細菌繁殖，相當難醫。貴欄倘能賜吾良方，實爲大衆造福。</p>
<p>張仲明醫師答：用百分之十永楊酸油膏搽抹癢處，可能見效。來函述及Xp光治療無效，或係所照次數不夠關係。</p>

<p>上週金融趨勢尙稱平穩，中行不斷拋售黃金，投機份子已大受威脅，行情穩定在一六零萬左右，中行美匯價格亦掛定二零二零不變，惟華股統債，塲外小有彼動，因當局聲稱統債還本付息，另訂辦法，係俟查明有無敵僞刦掠情事，致投機家大爲沮喪，掀起慘烈跌風，丙種曾瀉至一千二百五十元，惟游資見低拾取，同時又有統債可調新公債傳股，故不久即又見高翔，週三曾做到一千九百元，終以支持乏力，一度反振，便盤旋而下，華股週初即鋒俏異常，美亞紗廠均創新高價，廣帮更積極活動，逐步向高峯邁進，直至週四，在多空爭逐下，起伏巨大，結果略見軋低，週五又復回俏，週六遊資轉向，於是連日俏利之華股轉趨疲軟，而閑散多日之外股又一變而爲挺俏，至於其他商品，以食米市價迭漲，最爲引人注意，但據關係方面調查，最近本市民食存底甚厚，足够數月之需，且糧政常局已向國內外產米區採辦大宗米糧運滬，近來因天雨連綿，來源略稀，商人藉口抬似，再則一般游資參與活動，擾亂市面，亦爲米價步漲之一因，聞當局對過剩通貨運用，將有新措置，以便游資歸人正途云。</p>
<p>現紗在上週問，初因黃金與股票漲風刺激，客帮現紗銷路良好，新買戶與補空踴躍，市價扶搖直上，入後因粵漢等主要客帮實際去化轉滯，而紡建公司接收日商之紗廠增開夜工，積極生產，以致市上供給籌碼充裕，勢遂急轉下游，全週以星期三之六十支日光二百九十二萬爲最高，星期六之十支九魚五十五萬爲最低，若以支數言，廿支特雙馬比前週跌九萬五千元爲最鉅，其餘各級紗的小三五萬元。</p>
<p>布市情况極平庸，毫無粉彩可言，結果較前週末無甚變幻，僅一二千元之升降，花市因紡建公司採辦獨旺，尤以細絨原料需要爲最鉅，致細絨市價俏而粗絨市價疲，除籽花一牌，比前週的小八千元外，其餘如米特林巴西花通州大中集等細絨花，俱昻五六千元不等。</p>

<p>— 嚴嘉榮</p>
<p>頃閱十三日貴報「讀者意見」內，刋載施君請當局闡明國債政策一則，關後感覺非但公債業同人苦悶，對於持券人更加撲朔迷離，據筆者見解，統一公債論法論情，自有其不可磨滅之價値，茲列舉四點如下。</p>
<p>（一）查一九三三年盟邦美國前大總統羅斯福令美元貶値百分之四十，一切債務概以通用貨幣償付，因此引起國債持券人之不滿，與政府發生爭執，遂有震動全球之金條款訟案，此案歷時二載，於一九三五年二月十八日經最高法院判決，分全國債務爲二部，（一）對於私人債務，當遵令以通用貨幣償付，（二）國債部份，按照發行時幣値償付，以盟邦先例言之，統債應保持戰前之價値。</p>
<p>（二）八二一一抗戰軍興，財部命令證券交易所停市，（當時專營國債舉股尙不在內）所有八九月期全部買賣，概以七十元價格結價了結，財部常局維持國信，大可欽佩，當時旣以七十元價格爲標準，理常保持上項價値，了無疑義。</p>
<p>（三）自抗戰勝利後，步入建國之途，各項建設開發以及復員縮軍，皆須大量支出，在此國家收支不平衡之時，祇有增高賦稅及發行國債二途，欲使國債得人民踴躍投資，樂於購買，必須保障債券之原有價値，吾則人民視公債爲長途，對於發行前途，未免窒礙。</p>
<p>（三）二十五年統一公債，本係將舊債券整理發行，持券人已歷受損失，爲數不貲，以前因鑒於國家環境關係，故含痛忍受，毫無怨言，今抗戰勝利，國家已列强國之林，沒收敵偽巨額資產，倘再使持券人受無名損失，豈得謂事理之平。</p>
<p>總上列四點，足證統債本身理當應有原値之存在，筆者意見如是，尙望海內賢達有以敎之。</p>
<p>按統債時價，超過票面已久，且其漲度極高，其所持理由，大的常與嚴君相同，故爲照刋如上。至於政府見解如何，可參看二中全會中之議論。</p>

<p>財政部花紗布管制局，原定本月底結束，但結束工作，未辦理完竣，結束期間，將因此延長</p>
<p>經濟部煤焦管理處，近來燃煤供應情形得悉如下：二月份產量爲八萬九千八百八十噸，配售額爲八千九百十九噸，近以渝市工廠大部停工，且人口漸次减少，故重慶區存煤日益富裕，多有運往宜昌者，每月約三千噸，</p>
<p>據經濟部負責人稱：關於收</p>
<p>區敵產接收情形，以台灣較爲利，　台灣行政長官辦公處對經濟事業之接收，僅指派數人前往接收後，即令其織續生產，然後再加以整理，故工廠生產從未中斷，此與國內平津京滬，粵漢等地敵產之接收方法，逈然不同，故其收效亦甚宏大云。</p>
<p>美國戰時對於猪　進口及銷售限制辦法，已由當局明令廢止，牛羊尾髮及馬　等進口管理條例，亦因戰事終止，而同時宣佈取銷此類貨款之進口及轉口，惟仍須經過申請，目前美國猪鬃存底尙足數月之用，預料於本年六七月間，將有大量猪鬃由中國運往，</p>
<p>我國向美國要求長江水利鉅額貸款，美方條件，須中國蠶絲增產達日本之年產五十萬關担數量，目前我國全年產絲量不過十一萬關担，中央當局次計擴大生絲產量，以供國際市塲需要。</p>

<p>— 陳紹祖</p>
<p>關於剩餘紗布發還問題，雖爲處理敵產案件之部份，然已引起社會人士之注意，如長此陷於處理不確定之狀態，對於滬民衣的問題，不能謂無影響。敵僞產業處理局對此，初曾以核准發出批示，繼則蔽僞產業審議委員會第四九次會議，又復以僞棉統會徵購紗布，歷時已久，所有紗布自接收以來，多已移動或變賣，無從查證，審議結果，礙難照准發還。（已載見本報新聞版。）按政府機關對人民之批核，前後矛盾參差，徒使人民對政府之信仰無由堅定，茲姑勿論，即以事論事，過去本市各商所被敵僞强迫收買之紗布，其爲脅迫强制而非木於交易上受讓人之資格而收受，尤非出於出賣人自由意志之意思表示，殊爲明顯，在法律上其所有人即得請求返還，蓋依民法第九二條之規定，被脅迫之意思表示，得爲撤銷，且依其法意解釋，並不以無償行爲爲限，有償行爲亦得爲之、故無論其行爲爲有償無償，皆得撤銷其意思表示，蓋法律幷未規定須以表意人不收對價方爲無效或始得撤銷爲要件也。　又敵僞產業處理辦法第四條第一項，「產業原屬本國盟國或友邦人民經查明確實證據，係由日本强迫接收者，應發還原主。」此項規定，亦即根據民法上意思表示之原則所制定，紗布發還一案，業經該處理局提交法律顧問委員會研討，已認爲依照處理辦法及法律觀點，應予發還，幷經核准批示，則審議委員會之審議結果，又突予人民以相反之駁斥，究係處理辦法之不適用於紗布一物乎？抑審議機關與處理機關對已經修正公布之處理辦法有所異議乎？殊令人民無所適從。</p>
<p>至四九次審議會議之審議意見，關於過去所購之紗布，認爲接收以來，多已移動或變賣，無從查證諸點，凡此皆不足以為請求發還事實上之障礙，蓋物在法律上，無論其爲特定物或不特定物，代替物或不代替物，惟其因違法行為被取去的，所有人皆得請求返還，紗布爲不特定物，亦爲代替物，更可以同種類數量品質之物而爲處理，且本案內被强迫收買之各商，尙願就其剩餘之紗布，依照數額比例領回，利害關係人間旣無所爭議，則當局無須查證原物而為發還之標的物，是在事實上亦幷無因難可言，總之；各商請求領回此項紗布之剩餘額，在法律上旣無違背，於處理又辦法不相悖，事實上亦無困難，當局爲體恤民艱，實有予以發還之必要也。</p>

<p>— 倫敦特約記者雪岩寄</p>
<p>本報二日航訊</p>
<p>英國內部，現在最重要的問題，是如何加緊生產，恢復英國的繁榮。光其看到美國的商品，已在向世界市塲推銷，而英國工廠則方閙煤荒，勞工不够等問題，遲遲不前，更不由人不着慌。內閣總理艾德禮，特於三月三日晚上向全國廣播打氣，向實業家及勞慟家同時呼籲，請以全力滑加生產。同時在三月的第二個星期內，從艾德禮起，貝文，摩理遜等一班要人，全體出馬，作公開演講，檢討英國的生產情形。英國政府的大員，言論平常都發表於上下兩院，廣播不多，更不作應時應節的點綴廣播，所以這次大規模發動，總算是盡最大努力了。此外工商界與勞働界，亦同時動員，籌組英實業界舉國生產總參謀部，其任務爲就一般生產政策和生產事業優先權方向，向政府提供意見，其組成分子，爲勞工界代表與廠主方面各佔牛數。將來此項組織，對英國生產增加的貢獻必多。</p>
<p>單調食譜嘖有煩言</p>
<p>大兵之後，必有凶年，這句話古今中外，皆無二致。大戰去年方了，現在到處閙着飢荒。英本國的食單，本來已嫌太單調，各方噴有煩言，但嚴近看到印度及德境英軍佔領區的飢荒情形，實在可憐。而英倫三島，得獲倖免，也頗能以此知足自慰了。在各荒區中，尤以歐洲的災荒，最爲倫敦所關切，蓋近水樓台，無怪其然也。據說英軍佔領區內的德國境內，已無辦法，祗能減少每人每天的食糧。現在每人所能得到的食糧是每人一千五百五十卡洛里熱里，平常每人維持健康所需的熱量爲二千卡洛里，所以現在的標準，已不夠維持康健，再　少三分之一，僅能勉强維持到不致飢死罷了。但這種情勢，已無解決辦法，則最近將來，非但無法改善，或需更減短。據一般估計，或許一旦要按照目前每人的口糧，再減三分之二。換句話說，即每人每大祗能吃兩片薄麵包，一個蕃芋了。形勢實在嚴重，所以英佔領軍總司令蒙哥馬利特籲請英國政府，迅撥船隻，運糧急救，且看以後是否能有改善的辦法。</p>
<p>倫敦提出房子問題</p>
<p>房子問題，在英國嚴重極了。凡是嚴重的問題，必然成爲保守及工黨爭論的焦點。近來倫敦市議會中，因競選二個議席，又抬出房子的建築問題了。保守黨說，工黨去年在竸選時，許諾解決房子問題，但現在執政半年，顯然不能實有他們的諾言。但工黨的人却說，工黨執政半年，比保守黨執政十年所建的房子還多，於是舉出許多製字。從實際看，二邊的話都對。今年英國房子問題的嚴重，距離間題解決的時間猶甚遠，是毫無疑義的。但工黨說它執政牛年，較保守黨十年還有成績，也有道理，因爲在以前，房子不成問題，所以建築是私人問題，不關政府之事，所以自然不這房子。在戰爭期間，房十雖已成問題，但政府無暇及此，所以也不建築。迨去年工黨執政，把建築住宅，列爲最重要的政衆之一，所以成絨比保守黨好是當然的。</p>
<p>關於建築問題，兩黨意見衝突之處，尙不止此。保守黨認爲私家建築公司，規模宏大，效努力甚高，所以政府應把問題委託他們，津貼他們。工黨反是，認此舉乃使私人公司發財，所以主張應由政府直接鳩工辦理。據衛生大臣裴文最近發表住宅問題報吿，謂工黨執政以來的六個月中，已共建房子一千九百零九幢。其中由私人公司建築的爲一千一百十六幢，而政府工人所建的爲三百五十二幢。保守黨報紙大字標題，譏諷着說，「裴文的一羣嘍囉到今才建三百五十二幢房子。」　連日報載印度，埃及等各地反英，要求英軍撤退。一家報紙很敏銳的述想到房子問題上去，開着玩笑說，倫敦的房東太太在了這些消息一定很高興，各地英人都被趕回國來，出租房子一定是筆好買賣了。</p>
<p>衣服分配　點數增加</p>
<p>英國工業復員，雖然自覺很慢，上起政府與議會，下迄報章雜誌的言論，都討論這個問題，焦慮着如何可以恢復英國的繁榮。但實際上，今日之倫敦，已比去年秋冬之間，有顯然的進步了。譬如說衣服分配制的點數，自三月起，巳普遍增加每季四點，即以前每人每季僅得廿點，現在可以得二十四點了。同時點的價値，對於許多物品，已經提高。譬如女大衣一件，以前需要十八點，現在祇要十二點了。此外，許多戰時的特殊限制，三月份起，亦一律取消，例如一套男西裝上所能做的口袋和所能釘的鈕扣，在戰時都有限制，以節省材料。限制的結果，倫敦西裝，袖口上都沒有鈕扣，因爲袖口上的鈕扣，完全是裝飾品，戰時自然沒有存在的權種。但自三月份起，此項限制，亦已取消，你在西裝喜歡釘多少鈕扣，縫多少口袋，都沒人過問了。此外戰時女鞋跟的高度有限制，從三月起，這限制也取消，女鞋跟任你高到頂得着天，據說也悉聽尊便，國家再也不來麻煩你省鞋跟材料了。</p>
<p>反弗朗哥　已　潮流</p>
<p>軸心戰敗，法西斯主善跟着籌終正寢。現在全世界中，仍舊打着法西斯牌號的殘孽，祇剩西班牙的弗朗哥政權一個孤種了，同時，它也成爲世界各國唾駡的對象了。從聯合國會議決議宣布與弗朗哥政權絕緣起，今天英國職工同盟發一個宣言，臭駡弗朗哥政權，要求政府與它絕交，明天布魯塞爾的社會主義黨又發動一個遊行示威，反對弗朗哥。而法國的各左傾政黨及西班牙逃在海外的共和主義者，更每火不駡一次弗朗哥彷彿不過癮似的。但說來也奇怪，弗朗哥彷彿很精通小國哲學，笑駡由他笑駡，做官我自爲之。他在馬德里稱孤這寡，元首位置，似乎坐得挺穩式的，駡的人衹能在西班牙國境以外，在西班牙國以內，至少暫時還不能動他分毫。幾個在法國境內，曾參加過對德作戰的西班牙革命分子，最近潛入西境，密謀有所活動，反比弗朗哥逮住法辦。這下可眞觸動了世界公憤，法國首先提議，以弗朗哥政權事，提交聯合國安全理事會討論，但法國還不打緊，法國要眞有所行動，正如法外長吿訴法議會式的，必先徵得英美同意，所以祗要英美不同意，弗朗哥也還可以滿不在乎。　現在美國忽然也主張有所動作了。主張由英美法三國互相咨商，籌組建於廣泛民主基礎上的看守政府，以弗朗哥政權萬一壽終正寢，可以原班人馬，開人西班牙去辦理後事。此舉雖非直接以英美法之力，推倒弗如哥政權，而另設政府。但此舉假定弗朗哥政權必倒，而且明示英美法的同情，在新政府一方面，所以予以援助方便，也是很可能的。假使英美法眞的一政行動，弗朗哥恐怕就無法支撑了。在這三國中，英國以前曾宣布過，不主張強以外力云推倒弗朗喬政權，而應由西班牙人民自行去努力，這話的作用，無異宣布對弗朗柯不侵犯諾言，所以弗朗哥在過去半年中很放心。但現在美國出來領導，並且發表十件在德國俘獲的公文，指明弗朗哥與希特勒等在大戰期間的勾結，且弗朗哥有要求佔領直布羅陀等約，於是英國政府，也改變態度，參加美英法三國宣言，鼓勵西班牙人民，起來和平的取沙弗朗哥政權，組成在民主基礎上的看守政府。弗朗哥政權，至此，或者眞不能再支持了。又紐約大主敎斯比爾曼現方銜敎皇之命，在馬德里，或則正在有所實際接洽，亦無所知。（三月二日）</p>
<h3 id="c81">英蘇外交大辯論　現存二十年友好條約　貝文提議展至五十年 <a href="#c81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>這一兩個月來，倫敦人士注意的中心，是聯合國會議，而聯合國會議中，最受人注意的，是安全理事會中接連着的幾塲大辯論，自伊蘇糾紛案，蘇聯提議希臘英軍應撤退案，烏克蘭要求聯合國派遣調查團調查荷印英軍是否危及國際和平案，至叙利亞黎巴嫩聯合要求撤退其國內駐軍案。其中除了最後的一件提案外，其他幾件都是英蘇間爭論的焦點，幸而英國在這幾塲辯論中都佔了上風，安全理事會的最後決定，實際上都是按照英國意見作結論的。會議結束，英國人放心了，插了一口氣，彷彿天下又可以太平了似的。有機會可以仔細反省檢討英蘇這幾次爭辯的後果了。</p>
<p>外交辯論　兩日不輟</p>
<p>在聯合國開會期間，因爲外相貝文太忙，致無暇辯論外交問題的議會，本週會議旣經結東，議會便規定以二十·二十一兩整旦專辯論外交事件。辯論的中心，自然又集中到英蘇的關係上去。政府黨和反對黨都有很多的意見發表，一致承認英蘇關係，不够圓滿，同時又復一致承認這是很遺憾的現象。英國報紙，在這兩天中，也都有社論，評述英蘇關係，所表示的意見，也和國會相彷，很可以看出英國是如何焦慮英蘇關係的不圓滿。</p>
<p>辯論是由前任近東事務大臣麥克米倫（MacMillan）開始的（反對黨），他很稱許貝文外相在聯合國安全理事會中的成功。接着發言的人很多，最重要的有不管部大臣培克（Noel　Baker），前任外相現在反對黨的代領袖艾登和現任外相貝文，兩黨的立塲，雖各有不同，但在對蘇政策這件事上，意見幾乎一致。所以就與其說是辯論，母寗說是闡明英國一致的對蘇立塲。總結起來，不外希望蘇聯了解英國對蘇的態度，相信英國的善意，和希望與蘇聯合作的然忱。同時英國也相　蘇聯希望在戰後世界中彼此合作的誠意。不過正似艾登所說，「聯聯需要合作，但她需要的合作，似祇能依照她的條件。這是不行的，遲早會使我們碟到困難。」艾登又說，「蘇聯的盟邦，不能忍受蘇聯一方面盡嚷着需要一致，似乎魔術一般，另方面儘追求她自己的政策，全不顧其盟邦的感情和利益」。</p>
<p>英蘇戰爭　似無可能</p>
<p>眞的，英蘇之間，今日需要和平相處，彼此合作，是千眞萬確的。彼此都很明白，誰也不含糊。問題祗是利害怎樣相調和，允其是不要因其中一國追求片面的利益，而不顧另一國的利益。假使有人認爲今日英蘇間的衝突，會釀成戰爭，那是傻子，至少在短期內不但是不可能的，而且是不可想像的。實際上英蘇間許多劍拔弩張的衝突，是假定在英蘇不會作戰的信念上的。譬如外相貝文，在答覆艾登的辯論中就說，一據說我們有傾向與蘇聯作戰之嫌，或則勢必出此，但我却不能想像英蘇在任何環境下至於作戰。蘇聯的領土，自千島羣島起，直至其附雜國，是個其大無比的大陸國，我不知我們有什麼可戰之處。此種思想，絕未進過我腦海，我同時確信也未進過政府中任何同人的腦際。」貝文甚至說，他去年底到莫斯科時，曾向蘇聯領袖解釋英國對蘇友善之意，他向蘇方建議，「我們之間，現在訂有二十年的友好條約，你一們如果願意，我們可把二十年展長至五十年。」</p>
<p>我們相信，貝文的話，是誠懇而又坦白的。我們如仔細分析英國在朝在野兩黨兩日間在議會中的辯論，和因此而引起的報紙官論，很可以看出英舉國承認英蘇關係，目前見善。同時關係縱然惡劣，也相信不致於遽至戰爭，因爲雙方都沒有此意，在英國的六場，自信對蘇不懷敵意，尤其沒有扶植其鄰近小國，以和蘇聯故意爲難之意，希望蘇聯不必猜疑。反之，英國在世界各地，也有很多利益，希望蘇聯也能顧及尊重，英國自覺對蘇讓步已多，但也有不能讓步的限度，譬如說伊朗問題就是一個。英國希望和蘇聯調整關係，但英國不能讓步的處所，立塲也是很堅定的。在戰後世界中。英國極盼能與蘇聯友好合作。但問題是在利害衝突之處，彼此有沒有方法調整。</p>
<p>說起英蘇衝突，我們知道是近半世紀來的老話。凡是兩國勢力同時擴張的時候，利害就交錯而發生衝突了。衝突的地點，在帝俄時代，從近東一直亘及遠東，本世紀初的英日同盟，就是英國想藉新興日本的力量，來抑制帝俄勢力在遠東發展的結果，在近東一帶，英蘇關係也在外交史上添上許多糾紛。直至第一次做界大戰起，蘇聯發生革命，忙於內部問題，無暇向外發展，所以英蘇關係雖米見怎樣改善，但因互相擴充勢力而引起的利害衝突，暫時得吿平靜。迨此次大戰的後半期，英蘇成爲戰友，在作戰期間，合作無間，關係確至友善。不過德國旣敗，蘇聯乘戰勝餘歲，四面八方的求發展，於是英蘇間的矛盾衝突又起來了。從波蘭，南斯拉夫等流亡政府的問題爭論起，直至最近聯合國會議中的一大堆爭辯止，總算到了頂峯。我們知道去年倫敦舉行的五外長會議無結果而散。貝文曾在這會議中，和莫洛托夫直接衝突過。及至年底莫斯科舉行三外長會議，不論官方怎樣說法，三外長會議，實是補救五外畏會議的失敗，並爲聯合國會議前夕的一種預備會議，謀求三大强國間的協調的。會議結果，莫斯科方面認爲非常成功，因爲蘇聯的要求，大致達到了目的。華盛頓方面，也認爲相當滿意，妥協已有了結果。惟有倫敦的輿論，普遍表示不滿，而且相當沉痛。至於不滿的原因，乃英國認爲莫斯科會議，祗是，美蘇間的互相妥協，英國參與祗是陪襯而已，英國的希望，完全被忽視了，蘇聯對英，絲毫不肯讓步。當莫斯科會議召開時，伊期北部的獨立運動，正有燎原之勢，因此英國對莫斯科會議，期望甚高，希望能在會談中尋求出一個解次的辦法。且在會議期間，英國駐伊朗公使，也特地趕至蘇京，藉備咨詢。但結果因蘇聯態度，意外強硬，英國原來的期望，絲毫不能達到目的。直至這次聯合國會議，伊朗問題，提出於安全理事會，蘇聯才承認伊蘇繼續直接交涉，將來還報吿聯合國。接着希臘，印度納西亞等案，英國都算很成功，於是英國在莫斯科所受的悶氣，彷彿發洩了，現在可以冷靜的檢討英蘇關係，謀求補救邦交上的缺憾了。</p>
<p>英蘇衝突　最大關鍵</p>
<p>近東一帶，實在是英國是通達印度的生命綫，大英帝國的完整，就寄託在這條生命綫上，所以英國重視這條交通綫的安全，不讓大國威嚇，是理所常然的。反之，蘇聯到處在求溫水港，伊朗是它通達波斯灣印度洋的橋樑，蘇聯但有力量時，就沒有放鬆過。遠在一九〇七年的帝俄時代，英俄在波斯，阿富汗，印度等一帶利害衝突的結果，曾訂立協定，其中關於波斯部分，其可作爲我們今日伊朗問題的參考。根據一九〇七年的英俄協定，把波斯的勢力範圍，分成三部分，北部包括德赫鬧，伊斯巴漢（Ispahen）在內，作爲帝俄的勢力範圍，中部為緩衝地帶，而通達波斯灣的木特阿巴斯和通達印度與阿當汗的孔道塞斯坦Seista，一帶，則爲英國的勢力範圍。若以這條約規定，來和今日在伊朗的英蘇勢力的分野來相比較，則今日英國的勢力範團，似較當年還大些。不過我們不要忘記一</p>
<p>九〇七年的英俄協定，祗是甚多協定中的一個，當時勢力範圍的割分，是多種交換條件的結果。在分析今日英蘇在伊朗的衝突的，不能太拘泥此見。據說貝文在莫斯科會議中所提的解決伊朗糾紛的方法，是英美蘇三國派代表團至蘇軍駐區內調查，但爲蘇方所拒。據貝文廿一日在議會中說，他對派遣調查團一舉，以後如有可能，依然贊成。從英國所提出的方法來看，自始就很緩和，將來如條件適常，英蘇在伊朗仍有妥協可能。</p>
<p>貝文檢討蘇土邊疆</p>
<p>英蘇在近東第二個衝突之點，是在土耳其。我們記得當三外長在莫斯科開會時，蘇方報紙，對土耳其突然攻擊甚力，貝文稱之謂神經戰。後來王耳其態度堅定，似乎反較安靜了。此次貝文在檢討英蘇關係時，也談到土耳其問題，他說「蘇土邊疆，今仍成爲爭論題材，不勝遺憾」。至於達達尼爾海峽，他說英國「準備考慮由土蘇自行或由其他盟國參加，共同修改蒙德婁協定，在修改中，我人亟盼保持水道之國際性。」這可以看出土耳其問題也許在討論中，同時也說明了英國讓步的限度。　另據美國報紙所傳消息，五强外次在擬訂對義大利等國的和的時，蘇聯要求以特黎波利坦尼亞爲蘇聯的託治地，否則要求佔有多特堪尼斯島，如果此說果確，而且實現，則英蘇今後在地中海一帶，或恐播下衝突的新種子。　從上面的檢對中，我們可知英蘇利害衝突，決非偶然的，但以互讓的精神，皆可從交涉中獲得解決。爭辯時　形勢洶洶，那是彼此都深信不會導成戰爭才如此的。尤其我們知道英國是現實的民族，有可以商措的問題，爲什麼不從外交逾徑謀解決呢。所以在經過一度緊張後，英蘇將在外交上謀求妥協諒解，可能性是很大的。（二月廿三日）</p>

<p>自伊朗屬勢急轉直下，而邱吉爾與史達林又復反唇相　後，英國人已發生兩重心理：一方面則頗欲面對現實，不論現實是如何的令人不愉快；一方面却不信英蘇兩國的關係，已黑暗到如史達林所說的一般。英國人最希望的，便是能將目前的危屬予以澄淸，英國人所最關切的，還是在莫斯科眞正的目標。伊朗境內紅軍的移動，諸强間的不和，尙的在其次，一般人民預料貝文外相，當俠聯合國安全理事會於三月廿五日開會以後，才能對以下幾個令他最感不安的問題，獲得答覆：（一）蘇聯政府目前似已不顧他　是否反對一味從事領土的擴張，這種擴張究竟有無限度？（二）如何可自莫斯科獲得明晣的答案？（三）英美兩國的容忍是否亦有限度？（四）英美兩國官方的政策，在該方面能有如何程度的合作？（五）安全理事會開會時，如果伊朗問題僵局不能打破，蘇聯是否將脫　聯合國機權？（六）果爾，將發生如何的後果？</p>

<h3 id="c85">如何穩定生產 <a href="#c85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>— 王鷺</p>
<p>勞工問題，在工業界中，是相當嚴重的。在某種行業之中，因爲出品的銷行有旺月和淡月的分別，因此生產很不平均。因爲生產不能平均，於是在吒月就需要更多的勞工，在淡月需要較少的勞工。爲了解次生產上的需要起見，在旺月中就不惜用較高的待遇，從同業中去挖用勞工，甲廠挖用乙廠的勞工，乙廠又挖用甲廠的勞工，使勞工們不能安心工作。同時勞工們也往往在旺月中，提出增加待遇的要求，這種情形，在生產的進行中，是十分不利的。</p>
<p>一般工廠，也很想終年有規定的生產量，按照旺月的生產量做根據，在淡月中所生產的貨品，貯藏起來或是設法增加銷路。但在調整的期內，實在沒有力量，可以支持所有原料的購監，和勞工的薪給等開支，如果向普通銀行貸款，那末又不能負担巨大的利息。</p>
<p>據筆者的意見，最好的辦法是由國家銀行對工業界實行抵利放款，低利押款，或是普遍推行承兌匯票，那末工廠可以從容支配全年的生產量。因爲生產量能够固定，就可以有統盤的預算，勞工的待遇，也可以固定，或隨着生活情形，逐步提高，他們就可以安居乐业，同業之間，也不必有挖用劳工的必要。</p>
<p>因為工廠的種類很多，在着手之初，似乎可以從同業工會入手，加以調整。研究，然後實行，不知社會賢達，以爲如何。</p>

<p>— 清和</p>
<p>我們誰都不能否認，我國一般人的知識程度，實在太淺，因此進步非常遲緩。</p>
<p>在美國的工人，不但組織他們自已，而且敎育他們自已，道一種情形，正可以作爲我國的參考。</p>
<p>美國歷史最久的工人敎育機關，是「工人敎育處」在一九二一年，開始設立，分處遍及全美，他們的工作，包括書籍和小冊子的印刷，以及出版工人敎育的新聞。在美國各部都駐有各區代表，主要工作是設立討淪班，每次的討淪特間從一天到五天。參加的人數車等，有時有二十至三十人，作較深的研究，有時候有六百多人參加，一九四〇年六月，第十屆的研究班和新澤西州的勞工協會在路特加斯大學舉行，有三百人參加，舉行了五天，討論的題目是「勞工與世界危機」</p>
<p>第二個在全國設立的工人敎育機關是「美國勞工敎育服務社」經常供給全國各處以研究材料，答覆關于工會，工人敎育委員會，勞工大學，圖書館等的諮詢。還出版小冊子和書目，協助工會的敎育處計劃課程並聘請敎員。</p>
<p>有一個國際女子服裝工會的敎育處，成立於于一九一六年，到了一九三六年，全國有五十八個城市設立敎育處，參加上課或作團體研究的有二萬二千人。各班的功課，包括英文，議會法，演講術，時事，國際女子服裝工會歷史，經濟學，勞工問題等。</p>
<p>政府方面，對於工人敎育，也是非常注意的，一九三三年政府的工人設計處，特別設立工人服務計劃來推進工人敎育，在三十五州設有特別的督學來獎勵，組織工人敎育。</p>

<p>效能專家卡遜先生曾說要使一個企業組織的純益加多，首先要做到的就是銷路的增加。如果銷售額能够增加百分之二十，那末利益也就可以增加。</p>

<p>在美國通用汽車公司的研究部裏，有一個六十九歲的凱得林先生。在通用汽車公司的研究部裏，工作了五十年，並不能算一回事，而只是一個良好的起點而已，對於無盡量的前途，是微小得很的。</p>
<p>但凱得林先生對於通用汽車公司的貢戲很大，他曾發明自動開車器，使美國的車輛得到一種準步；他所發明的伊脫汽油，使第二次世界大戰，獲得勝利；他的狄賽爾火車頭，使鐵道上獲得了新的發展；他又發明了人造熱度器，使醫士們容易判斷梅毒和別種嚴重的疾病。</p>
<p>這些偉大的功績，在凱得林自己看來，是不足為奇的，因為他有一種人生哲學，就是：「當你自已認爲滿足的時候，你就不會進步」他永遠不滿足的精神，使他永遠年輕，他正在自已敎育自已成爲一個工程方面的醫生，這是科學界的一種新的職業，他希望從事研究醫治痛症的方法，他的志願，曾在去年獲得通用汽車公司施樂安先生的同情，捐助了四百萬元作為基金，已在紐約</p>
<p>凱得林先生吿訴別人，要獲得事實，唯一的辦法是用試騐的方法，他在家裏也隨時隨地都要做試騐的工作，他的太太拖他出去看電影，等到他從電影院裏回來，節目單上已經劃滿了各種符號，他曾把他太太的打蛋器來試騐無綫電的綫圈，到處是試騐。</p>
<p>李有下列的幾條眞理，是値得記下來的：</p>
<p>「研究的工作是試騐佔百分之十，和同事們能夠和衷共濟要佔百分之九十」。</p>
<p>「所有的研究工作，是百分之九九·九的失敗，祇要有一次的成功，就可以大功告成。」</p>
<p>「你要使你的試騐不失敗，就要要你繼續努力，直到試騐成功之前的最后一次試騐。」</p>

<h3 id="c89">工商管理概論 <a href="#c89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>— 徐百益</p>
<p>（一）均衡的管理</p>
<p>工商管理，在中國似乎是一個比較新穎的名詞，實際上它的肇始和發展，也還是近五十年來的事，因爲工業日益發達，就不能再缺少組織，和有系統的管理方法，而必須利用科學化的有秩序，有系統管理方法，因此工商管理，又可以名爲科學管理。</p>
<p>工商管理的最大的原則，就是要做到以最低限度的資力和勞力，產生最高限度的效率。因此工商管理，在一個順利的組織中，固然可以推行以後而發生效果；在一個亟待挽救的事業中，一經採用，更可以有顯著的效力。在國外有許多工商管理專家，他們的工作，是研究一個組織中的缺點在什麽地方，在找到缺點以后，就利用工商管理的原理，加以改革調整，或實施各種新的方案，例使一個垂危的事業，走上復興之路。</p>
<p>據一般專家的意見，以爲創設一個新的組織，比較去整理一個固有的事業，容易得多。因爲創設一個新的紙織，可以步步留意，完全有計劃，有步驟的做去，有條不紊，沒有牽制；在一個固有的組織中，那末往往有許多積習，一時不易改革。然而在興趣上着想，那末能够把一個垂危的事業，挽救過來重復具備一種蓬勃的現象，是比較興趣濃厚而更能够顯出一個專家的才識的。</p>
<p>然而事業到了危險的境地，再加以挽救，是消極的工作，積極的工作，應該在最初創立的時候，或在感覺有一點進行不很順利的時候，立刻施行各種新的管理方案，可以節省許多時間，人力，以及金錢上的損失。</p>
<p>通常談到工商管理，是指一個整個的工作而言。因爲工商管理，非要顧到一個組織的各個部門不可。向來有許多組織中，因爲某一個部份。發展得非常迅速，其餘的部份，不能並駕齊驅，就要造成脫節則現象。譬如說某一個工廠，推銷部份的工作，突飛猛進，然而生產部份，始終不能有足量的生產以供需要，結果就不免使主顧失望，或改買其他工廠的出品。反過來講，如果某個工廠的生產量相當地大，然而推銷部份不能盡責，那末結果所製成的貨品，無法銷售，使資本不能周轉。</p>
<p>工商管理最重要的，是各個部份的平均的發展，各個部份，都要有適當的管理人才，並且各部份的管理人才，要取密切的合作，使事業可以迅速地發展。間時駁萵的主持人物，必須具備着管理的學識，和各個部份的專門學識。</p>
<p>很有許多企業組織的主持人，或者是由會計主任升任的，他所知道的不能越出會計的範圍，因此對於生產方面，對於銷售方面，都不熟悉，因爲不熟悉，就不能作適當的處置，即使有了缺點，也不能加以挽救或改善。</p>
<p>或者他是一個由營業主任升任爲主持人物的。他所知道的祇是屬於營業方面的，就不能了解生產部份或會計部份事務方面處理的實際情形。</p>
<p>也很有許多主持人物，對於工商管理的各個部份，完全沒有什麼知識，因此他在處理事務的時候，完全憑着他的理想或是已往的經騐，知其然而不知其所以然。如果他處理得成功，他並不知道因爲那幾點而成功；如果他失敗，也不知道由於那幾點而失敗。這在於主持人物的個人方面，果然是一種極大的損失，一個事業付託給這樣一個主持人物，也就非常危險了。</p>
<p>關於工商管理原理的應用，一般的工商管理專家，都認爲應用原理，可以節省時間，免除錯誤，和不必要的損失，同時更能够使事務簡單，進行順利。</p>
<p>在第二次大戰之後，美國竭力希望帮助幾個落後的國家走上工業化之路，他們準備派遣專家，襄助一切。在他們號稱這種專家是懂得怎樣做的（Krow　How），這懂得怎樣做就是懂得怎樣應用原理，而以原理付諸實施的。</p>
<p>在原理的應用方面，一個主持人物，不但自身要懂得工商管理的原理，同時更必須使他的同事們也要懂得工商管理的原理，並且還要充分利用他們所具備的關于工商管理的智識，聯合起來成爲一個事業的强大的推動力。</p>
<p>爲適應環境，應付裕如起見，現代的工商業，必須實行均衡的管理。所謂均衡的管理，就是Balanced　Management使三個最重要的部份——生產（Production），銷售（Sales），經濟調度（Financing）——有密切的聯繫。</p>
<p>這三個部份，不但要取密切的聯繫，更要有平均的發展，無論工作，人事，以至於開支方面，都要經過整個的規劃分佈得非常平均。</p>
<p>如果我們研究幾個成功的組織，一定可以發現他們的三個主要部份，是在平均而聯繫的狀態之下發展的</p>

The closing ceremony was held at 1 p.m. on the 17th after the nineteenth plenary session. Over two hundred committee members attended. President Chiang chaired the ceremony, leading the attendees in paying respects before delivering the closing address. The session concluded successfully.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 17th] The Second Plenary Session concluded on the 17th. The nineteenth plenary session in the morning passed several proposals and a declaration. The closing ceremony was then held. The session began at 9:30 a.m., with 343 committee members present. President Chiang presided. The secretariat read the minutes of the eighteenth session and announced the election results for the Standing Committee of the Central Executive Committee and the party representatives to the National Assembly. The presidium proposed five messages of condolence: (1) to the families of soldiers who died in the War of Resistance; (2) to wounded soldiers; (3) to commend and comfort the officers and men of the National Army; (4) to express sympathy to compatriots and comrades in distress throughout the country; and (5) to express sympathy to overseas Chinese. These were unanimously passed.

<p>Increase National Treasury Revenue, Resolve Labor-Management Disputes</p>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 17th] The Second Plenary Session today adopted radical and decisive measures to resolve China's current economic crisis. President of the Executive Yuan Song Ziwen stated that these measures would encounter opposition from many parties, but the current situation was pressing, and tough steps had to be taken. The purpose of these measures is to curb inflation, increase national treasury revenue, resolve labor-management disputes, and adjust the salaries of civil servants, soldiers, and other government workers to match prices. The resolutions included the following points: (1) Based on the Three Principles of the People, to regulate capital and equalize land ownership, it was stipulated to add property tax, special excessive profit tax, and stock transaction tax. These new taxes would all adopt a progressive system, and property tax would be levied immediately. (2) To organize a labor-management dispute arbitration committee. Its decisions would be implemented by the government. If arbitration failed, the government could take over the enterprise. Employees of state-owned enterprises would be regarded as civil servants and would not be allowed to strike. (3) Salaries would be adjusted every three months based on the price index.

<h3 id="e2">President's Closing Address: Resolving to Adhere to the Original Intention and Implement the Policy of Peace; Hoping the Communist Party Will Faithfully Fulfill the Agreed-Upon Plan <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 17th] At the closing of the Second Plenary Session, President Chiang delivered a closing address, stating: "Today, the plenary session concludes. We have had practical discussions on various domestic and foreign affairs issues. The direction of our party's future efforts has also been detailed in the declaration. How should we, leading the country with the support of the majority of the party, strive to strengthen ourselves, implement the Three Principles of the People, and seek lasting happiness for the country and the people? I have repeatedly explained this to you all, so I need not reiterate. What I want to emphasize today is that the current era is completely different from the era five or ten years ago. The result of this war has made people around the world realize the preciousness of peace. Only by leveraging the power of justice, peace, mutual trust, and mutual assistance can we prevent the resurgence of aggressors. The safety, security, governance, and chaos of any country are closely related to the misfortunes and blessings of the world. World peace depends on the peace of all countries, and the security of any country must be sought in the context of world peace. Our China has resisted the longest and suffered the deepest from the war. Therefore, after the end of the War of Resistance, we decided that China must take the road of peaceful unification. Any domestic issues must be resolved through mutual understanding and concession to achieve the goal of peaceful unification. In recent years, all government measures have been carried out in accordance with this policy. The holding of the Political Consultative Conference, the promulgation of the order to stop the conflict and restore transportation, the establishment of the Military Mediation Executive Department, and the agreement on the reorganization and unified compilation plan by the military three-person group are all sufficient proof of our painstaking efforts to seek national peace and unification at any sacrifice and any concession. We will continue to adhere to our original intention and strive for its thorough implementation. In the meantime, I want to especially mention General Marshall's contribution. General Marshall has worked tirelessly during his three months in China, sincerely and sincerely assisting our China's peaceful unification as an ally, so that our country can embark on the road of peaceful nation-building, so as to contribute to the peace of the Pacific and even the world. Their proposition is in line with our country's policy. He is completely seeking a solution with us from an objective standpoint and prudent consideration. He has overcome many difficulties with fair and practical proposals. We are very impressed and very trusting of his hard work and sincerity. Our allies are so enthusiastic about China's peaceful unification, not to mention our own Chinese compatriots, who should abandon any prejudices, take care of the entire future of China, and implement our goal of peaceful unification. I hope that the Chinese Communist Party can sincerely accept the kindness of our friendly allies, just like our government, and faithfully fulfill the agreed-upon plan, without any extra-curricular actions or any unexpected complications. Then I believe that General Marshall's mission can be successful as scheduled. We must know that this is not only General Marshall's success, but also the success of President Truman's policy of the United States, and the success of our government's policy of peaceful unification. We believe that the success or failure of this policy is related to the whole situation. Everyone should pay special attention to this point. Therefore, we must all trust each other sincerely and tolerate each other for the sake of the country, so that any current problems can be truly solved and a clear path for peaceful construction can be paved for the country as soon as possible."</p>

<h3 id="e5">Full Text of the Declaration <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 17th] Declaration of the Second Plenary Session of the Sixth Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, full text as follows: The victory of the War of Resistance has been achieved since the Sixth National Congress of our party, which has allowed us to step into a new stage of peaceful nation-building. This conference is held during this important period. First of all, it must be pointed out that peaceful nation-building is the goal of our party and the nation. After the First World War, it was time to implement the President's nation-building strategy. However, it was missed in the hands of the remnants of the imperial system and separatist warlords. Now, after the Second World War, we have gone through eight years of bloody battles, eliminated the obstacles of Japanese aggression, and obtained a once-in-a-thousand-year opportunity to build the nation. We must not miss it again. In order to maintain the fruits of victory, we must grasp this historical key. In order to obtain the united cooperation of the whole country, this conference lists the following points to inform our compatriots across the country:</p>
<p>First, we must stabilize society, restore order, and complete the demobilization plan, as well as the work of peaceful nation-building. To build a nation, there must be stability, and stability must have peace. These are interrelated. Facing the devastation after eight years of the War of Resistance, experiencing the various obstacles and difficulties encountered in the demobilization work in the past six months, and witnessing the painful compatriots in need of relief, the displaced in need of returning home, the unemployed in need of restoring their jobs, and the oppressed in need of liberation, we confirm that there should be no more disturbances and disputes in our country, and there should be no more disorder in various places. Only by meeting the needs of our country and people can we live up to the purpose of our party's hard work and struggle. The government has made many concessions in the past six months in order to promote the progress of demobilization work. This conference believes that it is the correct measure. The reason why the government seeks perfection is to convene domestic parties and social figures to jointly negotiate before the National Assembly is convened, which is also to obtain a stable and peaceful environment to facilitate the promotion of nation-building work. This may change the nation-building order set by our party, but our party's spirit for the country and the people should be known to all compatriots across the country. We must implement this spirit and spare no sacrifice in order to achieve the rapid completion of the demobilization plan.</p>
<p>Second, we must convene the National Assembly as scheduled, return the government to the people, and achieve our long-cherished wish to implement constitutional power. The purpose of our party's leadership of the National Revolution is to establish the Republic of China and realize the Three Principles of the People. Democratic politics is indeed the main goal of our party's revolutionary struggle. As early as fifty years ago, the Xingzhonghui had clearly declared that our party's revolutionary history is to create democracy for China. If there had been no brutal Japanese aggression and national</p>
<h3 id="e6">Councilors' Conference Opens the Day After Tomorrow; This Session Decided to be Fourteen Days <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Chongqing, 17th] The Councilors' Conference has decided to open at the Military Committee Auditorium on the 20th. Registration began yesterday. Eighty-seven people registered in one day. Councilors Huang Yanpei, Tao Baichuan, Duanmu Kai, and Liu Baimin, who remained in Shanghai, and Councilors Li Youchun, Wu Yifang, and Shao Congen, who remained in Chengdu, and dozens of others, are scheduled to come to Chongqing by special plane on the 25th to attend. This session will last for fourteen days, from the 20th to the 2nd of next month, and may be extended if necessary. A tea party will be held at 3 p.m. on the 18th to exchange views.</p>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 17th] The Councilors' Conference is scheduled to open on the 20th to discuss domestic and foreign affairs issues and provide advice to the government.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 17th] According to councilors, this session of the Councilors' Conference will focus on prices, government reorganization, and the situation in the Northeast. military obstacles, the constitution would have been implemented as planned long ago. Our party's resolutions and our party president's declarations over the years have all expressed our determination to implement the constitution as soon as possible. The government has never neglected the preparation for the implementation of the constitution even during the period of military tension. We urgently hope to return the government to the people, and convening the National Assembly is the secret path to returning the government to the people. The government has clearly announced that the National Assembly will be convened on May 5th. We must hold it as scheduled.</p>
<p>Third, we must explain our sincerity in implementing the resolutions of the Constitutional Government Consultative Conference and our determination to adhere to the five-power constitution. We have conducted detailed and solemn reviews of the various agreements of the Political Consultative Conference. In view of the necessity of domestic peace, stability, and unity, as well as the need to relieve the suffering of compatriots and stabilize the foundation of the country, we are willing to sincerely cooperate with all parties and social figures on all agreements of the Political Consultative Conference to promote its implementation. However, what we must insist on is that the revision of the draft constitution must conform to the legacy of the five-power constitution. This is because the Three Principles of the People and the five-power constitution are inseparable. Abandoning the five-power constitution will prevent the complete realization of the Three Principles of the People. The President's great and profound invention in the political system is to draw lessons from the constitutions of Europe and the United States and consider our national conditions to establish a long-term stability for the country. In the future, the soundness and consolidation of our national political organization require a perfect and feasible constitution. If the content of the constitution violates the five-power constitution, it will be difficult to implement in practice, and it will inevitably put the country in a disadvantageous position. Therefore, we must abide by and maintain the five-power constitution from beginning to end. This is really for the long-term interests of the country. I hope that all parties and social figures understand our position and understand our views. [To be continued]</p>
<h3 id="e7">Railway Management Rights Dispute Still Unresolved <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 17th Urgent Telegram] Chongqing News, Chairman Chiang is deeply concerned about the progress of the railway restoration project. He has summoned Song Ziwen, Zhang Zhizhong, and Yu Feipeng twice last week to inquire in detail, and personally ordered Song Yu to restore traffic on the Jinpu and Jiaoji Railways within one month. It is heard that Zhang Zhizhong has discussed the dispute between the KMT and the Communist Party over the railway management rights with Zhou Enlai, but there is still no result. It is now believed that this matter can be resolved after Marshall returns to China. However, judging from the fact that the Communist army controls traffic on various lines, the CCP apparently wants to emulate its friendly country and use fragmented railways as collateral and delay this issue until after the government is reorganized before dealing with it.</p>
<h3 id="e8">President of the Executive Yuan Will Not Be Changed for the Time Being <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 17th] Chongqing News: It is confirmed that the President of the Executive Yuan will not be changed for the time being before the government is reorganized. Sun Ke seems to be interested in this position. Zhang Qun has publicly stated that he still intends to engage in local work in the future, implying that he has a great desire to build a new Sichuan.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 17th] The Ministry of Finance will further streamline its subordinate units. The General Administration of Customs, which is equivalent to a parallel agency, is planned to be merged into the Customs Administration. It is also rumored that the Customs Administration will also be streamlined in the future.</p>
<h3 id="e9">Telephone Lines South of Changchun Cut Off; National Army in Shenyang Advancing; Sipingjie Under Siege in Critical Situation <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Shenyang, 17th] The National Army in Shenyang has been consolidating its defenses in the suburbs for days and making effective advances in the east, south, and north. Sujiatun on the south bank of the Hun River in the southern suburbs is an example. The city is peaceful, and water and electricity are sometimes available and sometimes not. People are scrambling to dump Jiang military tickets, so prices have risen by 100% in three days and are still rising. The plague is slightly slowing down.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Chongqing, 17th] The military uniforms issued by the Soviet army in the Northeast are red, light blue, pure black, without Russian or English, and the pattern is simple. Currently, the currencies circulating in the Northeast include the fake Manchukuo currency, the Soviet military currency, and the CCP currency issued by the Communist Party.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Chongqing, 17th] It is reported that a certain party is training 500,000 Japanese prisoners of war on an island near Dalian, with an unclear intention. There are 200,000 foreign soldiers, which are said to be the Soviet Union's preparations for major international events.</p>
<p>(Central News Agency, Changchun, 17th) The chairmen of the two provinces of Heilongjiang and Heilongjiang and all the receiving personnel arrived in Changchun by car from Harbin at 4 p.m. today. Since 4 p.m. today, long-distance telephone lines south of Changchun have been completely cut off, and the situation in Sipingjie under siege is critical.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Peiping, 17th] A certain political figure told reporters that the situation in the Northeast is still very chaotic. The CCP army may enter Harbin and even Changchun with the Li Zhaolin case. However, there is currently no diplomatic contact between China and the Soviet Union. Fu Bingchang is still stranded in Chongqing and has not returned. Jiang Jingguo has returned to Zhejiang to sweep tombs. How to resolve the Northeast issue is still hovering in the minds of Chiang Kai-shek, Xiong Shihui, and Du Yuming. It is generally judged that after Marshall consults with Truman, major diplomatic actions between China and the United States can be decided and started. Xiong Shihui is currently in Jinzhou dealing with the complex situation that is changing rapidly. Although there are criticisms of the Northeast receiving officials in Chongqing, there is currently no possibility of reorganizing the Northeast military and political organization and personnel. The claim that they will return to Chongqing to report is also inaccurate. Although there is news from Chongqing that the military three-person group has reached an agreement on the Northeast issue, the mediation department here has not received any specific instructions. But generally speaking, if the military three-person group can reach an agreement on the broad issues of the Northeast, the seriousness of the Northeast issue can be reduced.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Peiping, 17th] Li Zhaolin's death has thrown a new bomb into the current situation in the Northeast. This new bomb will be the roar of a hurricane that will soon hit the Northeast. What kind of background Li was assassinated by is widely speculated here. Some say that it is likely that a certain party wanted to use this to dilute and offset the Zhang Xinfu case. Others say that Li was quite close to the central officials in Harbin, which led to suspicion by radical elements of the Communist Party, and he was assassinated. The Liberation Sanrikan, a publication issued by the CCP here, firmly claims that it is a conspiracy by Chinese reactionaries against the Soviet Union and communism. Although the rumors are inconsistent, what is only known here about this matter is that Li Zhaolin was a very sensible Communist Party member. [Central News Agency, Washington, 16th, United Press] Senior State Department officials are gradually discussing the situation in Northeast China. Some people hope that the Soviet Union may take action soon to ease the tension, especially since Soviet Ambassador Gromyko has returned to Washington.</p>
<h3 id="e10">The Situation in Northeast China is Extremely Grave; China's Efforts Will Surely Succeed; Marshall Hosts Journalists to Discuss Impressions of China <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 16th] Marshal Marshall held a large-scale press conference at the State Department today, giving a general report on his three months in China as President Truman's special envoy. He stated the work he had completed and listed several important issues he will focus on after returning to China. He immediately reported on his work in China and the current situation in China, allowing readers to quote directly. The journalists then asked several questions, all seeking details on Sino-Soviet, U.S.-Soviet relations, and the current situation in northern Hebei Province, China. Marshal Marshall responded to the journalists' questions directly, humbly, and diplomatically. The full text of Marshal Marshall's statement is as follows:</p>
<p>Completing a Democratic Nation</p>
<p>The Chinese people are currently engaged in an effort that, in my view, deserves the cooperation of the entire world. This effort is almost unprecedented. The leaders of the Chinese people are working daily on peacefully discussing and resolving conflicts from the past twenty years, and making daily progress. They have now successfully ended the past twenty years of hostility. They have reached an agreement and are now working on demobilization and organizing the military into a national army. They have agreed to complete the basic principles of their country's political and economic progress, which Western democracies have taken centuries to achieve. If we want to achieve peace, "if the world wants to achieve peace," then China's current efforts must succeed, and there is an urgent reason for this.</p>
<p>Dependent on Other Countries</p>
<p>The success of China's efforts largely depends on the actions of other countries. If China is ignored, or if it encounters attempts to hinder its unified development and current aspirations, their efforts will surely fail. I believe the United States is best positioned to assist China in this. I deeply believe that the American people have a sympathetic concern for China. Our continued maintenance of peace in the Pacific, and the success of China's current efforts to promote unity and economic stability, are extremely important to the American people. I do not believe that any country has reason to suspect our motives in China. We do not seek to obtain any special interests in economics or similar areas. We do not ask for any price for our friendship itself. A stable government in China is of great importance to us. The coming months are extremely important for the Chinese people, and I believe they are also extremely important for the future peace of the world. The establishment of stable governments in various Asian countries is extremely important to us.</p>
<p>Beiping Military Mediation Department</p>
<p>The situation during my short stay in China was extremely complex. First, I was troubled by the U.S. military in the Pacific region, and then I was affected by the serious situation in Northeast China. Despite these difficulties, I believe that great progress has been made. I would also like you to have a better understanding of the organization we call the Executive Headquarters in Beiping, which is our most important tool in China at present. They organize several small groups that go to various critical areas in China to implement specific orders from various agreements, thereby transmitting them to the location of the conflict, whether it is combat behavior, restoring transportation, relieving a city under siege, sending back Japanese people, or the upcoming troop reduction, reorganization, and unification of all Chinese armed forces, all of which are carried out by these groups.</p>
<p>Without the Mediation Executive Headquarters, we would accomplish nothing. The Mediation Executive Headquarters is extremely important for implementing military agreements, including transportation. On my last night in China, until ten minutes before my departure, we were still making agreements on dispatching executive teams to the Northeast. It must be known that there is a lack of radio communication in various places, and there is almost no road transportation in these long-distance isolated areas. It is very difficult to transmit orders. I even had to travel 3,500 miles to the main areas where there were still disputes. There are still no representatives of the Executive Headquarters in the East Nine Provinces. The situation there is changing very quickly, and troops are being transferred everywhere, so various small conflicts are naturally unavoidable. These troops, especially on the Communist side, hardly know that we have established an agreement. Therefore, we must quickly send executive teams to the Northeast. The service of these executive teams is indeed invaluable. They not only work in extremely difficult circumstances, but also face great dangers. I would like to reiterate that without the Mediation Executive Headquarters we established in Beiping, we would not be able to implement these agreements. I met with General MacArthur in Japan and discussed the participation of Chinese troops in the occupation. General MacArthur expressed great welcome, and I think President Chiang will soon issue a public announcement on this matter.</p>
<p>Answering Journalists' Questions</p>
<p>In the question and answer session, Marshall stated: (1) The situation in Northeast China is extremely serious, (2) He will return to China soon, but the exact date has not been determined, (3) The food shortage problem is serious, approaching famine levels, (4) China urgently needs transportation equipment and factory machinery, (5) Financial aid to China is very complicated, but very necessary. The United States should give financial aid to China as a priority. Marshall refused to comment on the so-called (Inner Mongolia) issue, saying that he was not familiar with the situation. He also refused to comment on the definition of the Chinese Communist Party and its ideals. He also announced that the Chinese army is awaiting the reduction of 350 divisions to 50 divisions, and called this a "huge demobilization."</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 16th] President Truman's special envoy to China, Marshall, hosted journalists here today, and expressed his impressions of China, saying that the situation in Northeast China is "hanging by a thread." 250 divisions of the National Army, including 39 divisions trained by the Americans, are successively heading to that area. These American-style troops previously fought in Burma.</p>

No incidents occurred on the date due to strict precautions. The US authorities have investigated the names of these secret parties clearly, but have not arrested them because they have not been able to prove their connection to the Black Dragon Society.

<h3 id="e21">Editorial: How to Save the Industrial Crisis <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>Since the opening of the foreign exchange market, the following are the most concerned things for the general public: First, although the central government has not stipulated a fixed ratio for foreign exchange, it has a clear goal in mind. What exactly is this goal? Is it still going to be raised, and to what extent? If it is lowered, to what extent? The fact that the higher forward price caused a sensation in the foreign exchange market, the speculative market, and even the entire market some time ago shows the depth of general public concern. Second, the gold market was opened at the same time as foreign exchange. Since the eighth of this month, the Central Bank has continuously allocated and sold gold, and the total amount has reached 2,851 bars, thus absorbing more than 47 trillion legal tender. The market price of gold in this port has been fairly stabilized. If this port and other ports buy in large quantities and flow out in large quantities, I wonder if it will continue to allocate and sell? Is unlimited approval granted? In the past, it seems that there was only allocation and sale, and no purchase. If the price of gold falls, will we purchase according to the market? In other words: Does the Central Bank intend to stabilize the price of gold at a certain level? Also, is the legal tender exchanged for gold bars truly recovered? Or does it come in with the left hand and still go out with the right hand? What is the relationship with the adjustment or tightening of currency?</p>
<p>Third, closely following the opening of the foreign exchange market is the issue of foreign trade. Because the distance between domestic and foreign prices is too far; according to the current exchange rate, it seems that the export industry is still unable to obtain considerable and general encouragement, and the US dollar is also making a fuss about devaluation, I wonder if the future exchange rate will be further adjusted appropriately? As for imported goods, the situation is exactly the opposite. All orders are very lively. It is rumored that the import cost of American dyes is four-fifths cheaper than the market price in this port! If the US dollar is devalued, its cost will be further reduced. This, on the one hand, can of course obtain considerable remedies in terms of the supply of materials, and the high domestic prices are also expected to receive some dilution. The problem is that many production industries are unable to withstand the pressure and have encountered very difficult situations. Some factories have already closed down, and some are planning to sell. Can the phenomenon of large-scale closure of factories in the Great Rear Area be avoided here?</p>
<p>Regarding the above-mentioned issues, for the first two (1) and (2), we can only let the authorities answer with facts. For the third (3), the situation is becoming increasingly serious. If there is no remedy, it seems that after the victory, the turmoil in the economic circles of the rear area and the phenomenon of depression in the industrial circles are very likely to be discovered quickly. Then how to remedy it? We believe that this issue is too complicated and should be addressed from many aspects. For example:</p>
<p>(1) For imported goods that require a permit, the central government has originally set up a special agency to handle them. They can carefully consider the needs and make appropriate adjustments.</p>
<p>(2) Goods that are freely imported do not need to go through a permit when imported. However, the source of funds is still in the Central Bank. Tightening up the funds, all unnecessary sources can not be restricted.</p>
<p>(3) Among the enemy and puppet materials, the raw materials part is said to be very large, and some of it has already been allocated and sold. Regarding the allocation and sales situation, if the strategy of abandoning and waiting for the opportunity to sell is changed, that is, changing the simple income doctrine and taking the promotion of production as the guiding principle, and suppressing the selling price as much as possible, so that manufacturers can obtain cheap raw materials, then, in the competition of national goods factories, survival, it can increase a lot of help.</p>
<p>(4) Many materials that were originally plundered by the enemy and puppets should be returned as quickly and as much as possible, without going around in circles, making people hopeful but unreachable. Especially for merchants' goods that are very obvious in fact, such as gauze forcibly purchased, which the enemy and puppets have not yet disposed of, whether they have been moved or not, easy to identify or not easy to identify, should always be fully returned in accordance with the approved original plan, so that merchants who have been plundered can breathe a sigh of relief, rather than holding them back and deepening their pain. It must be known that these are merchants' materials, not enemy and puppet materials. If they have been disposed of, they may be requested for compensation, but if they have not been disposed of, how can they be confiscated and re-disposed of?</p>
<p>(5) Many light industries are now mostly taken over by the state, and the only reason is to help them restore production, not to compete with the people for profit. The government has long sworn an oath and declared this to the public. Then, are the factories that have not been taken over by the state, since they are in extreme difficulty, should they be substantially assisted separately in accordance with this principle? We believe that whether it is providing loans, supplying raw materials, reducing or exempting taxes, or helping them solve transportation and power difficulties, it is all the same: it must be fulfilled, not just verbal benefits.</p>
<p>Most importantly, it lies in the self-awareness and self-help of the manufacturers. During the War of Resistance, due to the interruption of sources and the urgent need, all kinds of crudely manufactured and low-grade goods could obtain wide sales and high profits, which was originally an abnormal phenomenon. Relying on hoarding and speculation to increase profits is especially a temporary and unsustainable means. Even the various external subsidies mentioned above are all temporary in nature and cannot be regarded as regular. Therefore, in terms of management, technology, and sales, everything related to business and production should be improved, striving for excellence, and striving to stand on an invincible position, in order to last long and become great, and achieve the goal of true industrialization.</p>
<p>The low labor cost was originally one of the favorable conditions for China's industry. However, due to the continuous rise in prices, wages are also constantly increasing. Some people estimate that according to the current exchange rate, many wages are already higher than those in the United States. Then, this favorable condition will also gradually disappear. If those loose, disorganized, redundant, and wasteful styles continue to exist and are not rectified, what the future holds is really worrying.</p>

<p>[United Press, New Delhi, 16th] Secretary of State Byrnes, in a speech given today at St. Patrick's Hall, said that America has no intention of uniting with the Soviet Union to deal with Britain, or with Britain to deal with the Soviet Union. America's hopes are placed in achieving security through the United Nations organization, which is the path to achieving lasting strength. I wholeheartedly support the implementation of universal military training, so that America can always maintain a well-trained reserve army. When necessary, America must use force to uphold the principles and objectives declared in the United Nations Charter. The world is currently embroiled in serious disputes, but if we all seek solutions in a spirit of concession and friendship, they can be resolved without difficulty. Eliminating the wartime mentality will take considerable time; we must be patient, persistent, stand our ground, and not be driven by emotion.</p>

<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 17th] According to a report from the Berlin correspondent of "The Observer": German</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Miami City, Florida, USA, 17th] Leading figures from American political, scientific, educational, and labor union circles recently formed a committee and today submitted a plan to President Truman advocating that the United Nations organization be transformed into a world government and that the veto power of the major powers be abolished. It is reported that this plan will also be submitted to members of the United Nations General Assembly and the United States Congress. The plan was drafted by Supreme Court Justice Douglas, with the assistance of members of the World Government Committee and the Atomic Energy Control Committee. [United Press, Miami, Florida, 15th] U.S. Supreme Court Justice Douglas told reporters here today that due to a lack of education, three-quarters of the world's population has not been able to read the Atlantic Charter or any other charter, and even if translated into their native language, they would not be able to understand it. If world peace is to be maintained in the modern era, the United Nations Charter should be revised to unite all countries in the world into a world federation, taking the same actions and not acting independently. However, to ensure that a world federation can be realized, it is essential to develop education so that the people can learn the meaning and purpose of a global federation. Douglas outlined the content of a world government as follows: (1) The world federal government will be modeled after the American federal system. (2) A world court will be organized according to the organization of the U.S. Supreme Court. (3) All countries should cede a portion of their sovereignty to the world federal government, but individual freedom must never be sacrificed. (4) Organize an international police force to maintain world security.  The Soviet occupying forces in eastern Germany will soon be redeployed, replaced by well-armed and well-trained police squads. Seventy-five percent of the Soviet troops have already withdrawn, and the rest will be withdrawn in a few weeks. This withdrawal has gone almost unnoticed.</p>

<p>[United Press, Neuhause, Bavaria, 16th] Emmy, the wife of Nazi second-in-command Göring, first met Göring when she was performing a Goethe play at the Weimar Theater. After their marriage, they lived a life of extreme luxury during the heyday of the Nazi regime, owning priceless jewelry, gorgeous clothing, and several enchanting residences that they could move between. Since the collapse of Hitler's Third Reich, she has become utterly impoverished. She was imprisoned in an American military concentration camp near Munich for five months, but after her release, she had no money, no direction, and nowhere to turn. Therefore, she and her eight-year-old daughter, Edda, live in a small, humble three-room residence.</p>

<p>[United Press, Hertfordshire, England, 16th] When a United Press reporter asked George Bernard Shaw today for his opinion on British Prime Minister Attlee's remarks in the House of Commons yesterday regarding the Indian question, Shaw replied that self-government should be earned through effort, not given by others.

Shaw also said that if India gains independence, it will encounter a difficult period of self-government, but after a considerable period of time, it will gradually improve. Shaw agreed with President Truman's statement on the Iranian question, saying, "Truman's view is correct; the situation in Iran is not dangerous."

<p>[Reuters, Paris, 17th] Forty-nine-year-old Dr. Petiot, a medical practitioner, murdered as many as 63 people between 1941 and 1944. The case is scheduled to be tried tomorrow in the Seine Court. In the basement of the defendant's Le Sueur Street residence, there was a death chamber. While the victims struggled and screamed in the chamber, he watched with pleasure through a periscope in his study. The corpses were then sent to the furnace for cremation. The victims were mostly Jews who wanted to go to South America, criminals carrying赃 who wanted to escape, or people who held evidence of the defendant's drug trafficking. Petiot claimed that his "Philetoxe Party" had also killed Germans and French traitors, and that there would be worthwhile statements to hear during the trial.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 6th] [The atomic bomb experiment will be held in May near Bikini Atoll in the Central Pacific. American people are quite afraid that this experiment will endanger other parts of the world. Major General Groves, the person in charge of the atomic bomb manufacturing project, today issued a statement by scientists (Dr. Teller of the University of Chicago and Dr. Bethe of Cornell University) to dispel fears and calm people's hearts. The statement is as follows: "Whether the atomic bomb explodes near the water surface, on the water surface, or under the water surface, it only causes local disturbances on the spot, just like a large amount of ordinary explosives. This explosion is not enough to cause radioactive transformation of seawater. Otherwise, this transformation will continue non-stop, causing an atomic explosion of the earth. We have carefully considered this. First, the elements contained in water are known to be abundant throughout the globe. If there is a high-speed chain reaction on the planet, the planet will explode and destroy itself, but this phenomenon does not exist on the planet. This shows that it is also the case in seawater. Second, the composition of delayed pure substances in the atomic bomb also accounts for a large proportion. Therefore, the temperature of seawater near the bomb is about one million degrees, which is far from the temperature inside the planet, which is about two million degrees or more. Therefore, the situation occurring in the water is similar to the location very far from the center of the planet. Scientists all know that the nuclear reaction at a temperature of one million degrees is not enough to compensate for the radiation loss to keep it going. The atomic bomb explosion in the Central Pacific will definitely not cause a chain reaction to evaporate the ocean or explode the earth. Therefore, we are convinced that the underwater explosion of the atomic bomb will not cause a self-sustaining chain reaction. This is indeed the case with the current form of the atomic bomb. If the atomic bomb contains sensitive substances, it is still necessary to think twice when releasing it, because the temperature in the water may be even higher."</p>
<p>[United Press, Roswell, 17th] It was announced here today: The Army and Navy had practiced with practice bombs shaped like atomic bombs in the turbulent sea near San Diego on Friday. Three B29 Superfortress bombers departed from Albuquerque, and nine F13 photography planes departed from here, flying more than a thousand miles to a point 200 miles off the coast, using a Liberty ship as the target. This was the last rehearsal before the atomic bomb test.</p>

<p>The most serious problems facing Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces now are the dangerous situation of the seawalls, with the Qiantang seawall already collapsing and causing disasters in Qibao and other places. With the approaching spring flood tide, the remaining seawalls are also in imminent danger. The water could potentially reach Changxing, cutting off the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway. The safety of this seawall is not only related to the lives of the people in the Hangzhou-Jiaxing-Huzhou area of Zhejiang, but also affects the survival of the entire southeastern people, including the counties of Suzhou, Changzhou, Songjiang, and Taicang in Jiangsu. If repairs are not completed before the autumn flood, the consequences will be unimaginable. Water conservancy expert Mao Yisheng, the chief engineer of the Qiantang River Bridge, as well as UNRRA Secretary-General Monner, who came from the United States to inspect the disaster situation, and Southeast Envoy Niu Yongjian, have recently visited one after another, and they all expressed great concern about the dangerous seawalls. Although the central government has allocated 60 million yuan to repair the dangerous seawall in Haining, it is still far from what is actually needed. Sun Xiaolou, director of the UNRRA Zhejiang-Fujian Branch, rushed to Shanghai the day before yesterday</p>

<p>According to Sun, the Zhejiang-Fujian branch includes the two provinces of Zhejiang and Fujian. Out of the 77 counties and cities in Zhejiang Province, only six counties were not disturbed by the enemy. Thirty-eight counties and cities, such as Changxing, Wukang, and Xiaoshan, were occupied by the enemy for a long time, and the loss of houses amounted to 702,900 rooms. Currently, 20 million people have no food or clothing and are wandering in other villages. In Fujian Province, seven counties and cities, such as Xiamen, were completely occupied, and thirteen counties, such as Lianjiang, were partially occupied. The branch is now actively seeking relief, he said.</p>
<p>The photo shows the situation of the Zhong Zi Hao stone seawall in Wubao, Haining, being destroyed by the tide in the autumn of the 34th year of the Republic of China.  He worked through the night to request an additional 200 million yuan in materials from the Executive Headquarters to repair the seawall. However, the entire project is estimated to require at least 600 million yuan. It is hoped that the central government, UNRRA, and local authorities will jointly assist in completing this barrier that protects the safety of the Southeast. According to Sun, if the seawall is thoroughly repaired to seek a permanent solution, it will require as much as 1.5 billion yuan.</p>

<p>A New Page in the History of Passenger Transport on the Two Railways Gasoline Train's Maiden Voyage: As Fast as a Rabbit</p>
<p>— Xingwu, reporter of this newspaper</p>
<p>Shanghai to Hangzhou in Four Hours: Faster Than the Express Train</p>
<p>Sleek and Smooth: One Hundred Miles per Hour Clean and Beautiful: The Tour Car Truly Lives Up to Its Name</p>
<p>The new-style gasoline train that had been advertised made its maiden voyage on the Shanghai-Hangzhou line yesterday. Tong Shida, the chief of the North Station, arrived especially early to preside over the departure ceremony. Director Hou of the Transportation Department, Deputy Director Guan, Section Chief Ouyang Zhi, Section Chief Li Songbai, who had come specially from Hangzhou, and senior personnel from various departments of the two railways crowded the station chief's office. Station Chief Lin Xiaojin was busy making phone calls, urging the much-anticipated "West Lake" to appear. Once, twice, until 7:55, it finally arrived at the station.</p>
<p>Three purple, streamlined "tour cars," accompanied by a strong gasoline odor, appeared before the people, immediately causing a commotion and keeping Chief Tong busy. Here, someone wanted to ask him for instructions; there, someone wanted him to explain. He also had to find time to accompany the reporters on a tour. He said: These are gasoline passenger cars received from China Railway. Now they have been renovated and repaired. There are four in total that have been completed. Three of them will be temporarily formed into a train, running once a day between Shanghai North and Wuxi every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, named "Taihu." Every Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday, and Sunday, it runs between Shanghai North and Hangzhou, stopping only once along the way at Jiaxing and Suzhou.</p>
<p>The gasoline train can travel at a speed of one hundred miles per hour. Because there is no need to add water or coal, it is very easy to operate, so it can reach Hangzhou in four hours and five minutes, which is 55 minutes faster than the express train. Each car has an engine, and both ends are equipped with starters similar to those of automobiles. If you want to reverse, you don't have to turn around.</p>
<p>Yesterday was the first day of operation. To be cautious, each car had two drivers. At 8:25, with a whistle, the train moved slowly. Because the reporter wanted to conduct an on-the-spot interview, he set off with the train. Because it was the first operation, not many people knew about it, and because it was raining, 32 of the 222 seats were empty. Twelve minutes after leaving the North Station, we arrived at the West Station. It was originally scheduled to stop for two minutes, but yesterday it stopped for four minutes because Director Hou, Section Chief Ouyang, and others wanted to get off.</p>
<p>The white carriages, the brand-new and soft velvet sofas, everywhere showed luxury. The car attendant diligently delivered hot water and hot towels, which can make you forget that you are in a car. Opening the car window, the fragrance of rapeseed flowers, the clear air after a long rain, made people feel relaxed and happy. People who live in cities can never enjoy the beauty of this nature.</p>
<p>Wang Axiao, the repair mechanic accompanying the train, explained the structure of the gasoline train in detail. The eight cylinders are arranged in series, with a power of 150 horsepower. The gasoline consumption depends on the quality of the engine. Yesterday, the three vehicles, GC1 and GC3, used a total of 110 liters (approximately 30 gallons) of gasoline from Shanghai to Hangzhou, while GC2 consumed 160 liters. One gallon of gasoline can allow one car to travel more than four miles. Unfortunately, the reporter is a layman in this field and cannot report in more detail.</p>
<p>Finally, it should be mentioned that ordinary trains are always delayed, but yesterday the gasoline train did the opposite, arriving "early." On the way back to Shanghai from Hangzhou, it arrived in Jiaxing 24 minutes early and arrived at the West Station a quarter of an hour early. Because the time is fixed, we had to stop in Jiaxing or the West Station to wait. Station Chief Huang of Jiaxing Station said: "The operating time will be adjusted immediately after the driving time is accurately deducted."</p>

<p>With the stabilization of foreign exchange rates, foreign trade has gradually begun to expand. Hu Yunqiu, the director of the Foreign Trade Group of the Enemy and Puppet Property Administration Bureau, stated that in order to attract foreign exchange for imports, reduce trade deficits, and stabilize currency values, efforts should be made to promote the export of native products. Currently, tung oil, hog bristles, casings, wool, cowhide, tea, and other commodities have markets abroad, but costs are still too high, quality is not yet refined, and transportation is difficult, all of which need to be improved. Furthermore, if commodity inspection procedures can be handled quickly, it will also be a convenience for exporters. In addition, the Enemy and Puppet Property Administration Bureau will soon have a large batch of seized goods that can be exported after inspection is completed.</p>

<p>Another Weakness in the Industrialists</p>
<p>Mr. Ren Shigang, Chairman of the Board of the China National Products Company and General Manager of the Wuhe Weaving Factory in this city, passed away at his residence on Sappho Road at 1:30 PM yesterday (the 17th) due to illness.

After graduating from the University of Hong Kong, he devoted himself to operating industrial enterprises, being cautious and honest, and strictly self-disciplined. He was especially kind and amiable in his dealings with people. Unfortunately, several years ago, he suddenly suffered from high blood pressure due to overwork. He consulted famous doctors, but ultimately could not be cured. He died at the age of 52. In addition to the two projects mentioned above, Mr. Ren also served as Chairman of the Cuizhong Manufacturing Factory, Renyi Hat Factory, and Mainland Leather Factory. He was about to develop his ambitions when he suddenly passed away, which is a major loss to the industrial community of our country.</p>

<p>A Repeat Offender; Lin Buwu Was Never a Good Person</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] After the corpse case at the Taishan Apartments on Xiafei Road was solved, the murderer Lin Buwu fled to Suzhou. On the morning of the 16th, he was finally arrested by the detective team of the Judicial Section of the Wuxian Police Bureau in the Stone Pavilion Lane in Taohuawu. Yesterday, the Lujiawan Branch sent personnel to Suzhou to escort the suspect back to Shanghai. The details are summarized as follows:</p>
<p>Wang Zhengzhong, an Accomplice in the Case</p>
<p>Since being captured in the Yianfang Lane on Yidingpan Road on the 12th, the suspect Lin fled without a trace. The police officers handling the case at the scene immediately went to Lin's residence at No. 27 to search. As a result, they obtained more than a hundred photos and many communication addresses. After careful study by Zhao Peijin, the Director of the Branch Bureau, it was determined that he had undoubtedly fled to the Beijing-Shanghai area. Director Zhao then sent official letters to the police bureaus in Kunshan, Suzhou, and other places, along with Lin's photo. Yang Huaichun, the Director of the Wuxian Police Bureau, received the official letter and instructed Tian Wenzong, the Section Chief of the Judicial Section, to order Cao Anchang, the Captain of the Debt Enforcement Team, to strictly check the travelers coming and going in various hotels. On the evening of the 14th, when Cao led officers and police to review the circulation book at the Tianran Hotel outside the gate, he glimpsed a traveler named Weng Songquan, which aroused suspicion. He then strictly asked the waiter about Weng's appearance and clothing, and showed Lin's photo. After the waiter confirmed that it was the same person, but did not know where he had gone. At this point, each officer knew that Lin had indeed come to Suzhou. After dawn the next day, Captain Cao sent police officers to investigate everywhere. Until the afternoon, an informant reported back to the team that Lin and his wife</p>
<p>Were Hiding in Taohuawu</p>
<p>At No. 37, Stone Pavilion Lane, the home of his father-in-law Xu Changgen (Xu is a staff in the JinCheng Hotel Relief House). At around 3:00 AM on the 16th, Cao led police to the address and knocked on the door several times. The person who opened the door was Lin's wife, Xu Luoyun. He immediately asked if her husband was there. Xu replied, "Yes," and was asleep. The plainclothes police officers rushed in. At that time, Lin was sleeping soundly in bed and was captured without resistance. A new-style No. 3 revolver and eight bullets were found under his pillow, already loaded. He was taken back to the police station for detention. On the morning of the 16th, after Director Zhao of the Lujiawan Branch received a long-distance telephone call from Director Yang of Suzhou, Director Zhao ordered Xue Minjie, the Acting Section Chief of the Criminal Section, Ni Jiafeng, a plainclothes patrol officer, Ma Bingzhang, a staff member, and Zhang Jun, a police chief, to take Wang Zhengzhong's wife, Wang Lu, on the 3:00 PM slow train to Suzhou to escort him back. They arrived in Suzhou after 7:00 PM, met with Director Yang, and stayed overnight. Yesterday morning, Acting Section Chief Xue made a long-distance telephone call to Shanghai to report the situation to Director Zhao, and confirmed that it was indeed Lin Buwu. They took the 2:30 PM express train to Shanghai in the afternoon. At that time, they were deeply afraid that the suspect would be cunning and that accidents would occur in the train, so Police Chief Zhang Jun jointly restrained him to prevent him from escaping. At this time, the suspect was wearing a blue cotton robe, torn cotton pants, and a Russian hat.</p>
<p>When the Suspect Lin was Escorted into a Carriage in Suzhou</p>
<p>The suspect Lin pulled down his Russian hat to cover his face, revealing only his eyes. This case had caused a sensation in Suzhou, and the onlookers along the way blocked the road. After arriving at the North Station, he was taken to a police car and driven directly to the Lujiawan Branch. Deputy Director Yu of the General Bureau attached great importance to this case and went to the branch bureau at around 4:00 PM. After the suspect arrived at the bureau, he personally conducted a preliminary trial and ordered him to be detained pending investigation. According to the suspect's confession, after escaping in Shanghai West on the 12th, he went to Wang Zhengzhong's home on Yaozhujiao Road, took his wife Xu Luoyun, and walked to Zhenru. That day, he took a train to Wuxi, stayed overnight, and then took a train to Changzhou, where he also stayed overnight. On the 14th, he returned to Suzhou and stayed in Room 209 of the Tianran Hotel. Because he read in the newspaper that the situation was tense, he moved to his father-in-law's house the next morning. He originally planned to stay for a day or two and then disguise himself and go elsewhere. According to Deputy Director Yu, the suspect had committed many theft cases in the past and was sentenced to ten years in prison fifteen years ago. He had also participated in the puppet organization under Xiong Jiandong and served as an adjutant. He was truly an evil demon who killed without blinking an eye. The suspect's arrangement for the shooting of Laoqi also had its clever and meticulous aspects. By luring a woman to an overly remote area,</p>
<p>The deceased would definitely not want to go, which would easily lead to exposure. Therefore, luring her to the highest floor of the Taishan Apartments for the shooting was a safe method of "seeking tranquility in the midst of chaos," so he was able to escape calmly afterwards. The director also told reporters that the time the report was received after the case occurred was 4:55 PM. The time the entire case was solved and the main culprit Lin Buwu was escorted back to Shanghai from Suzhou was also 4:55 PM, which can be said to be a coincidence. This case caused a sensation in Suzhou and Shanghai and became a topic of conversation in the streets and alleys. From the occurrence of the case to its conclusion, it only took a week, which can be said to be extraordinarily rapid.</p>
<h3 id="e48">Shanghai Branch of the Chinese Municipal Association Established Yesterday; Connecting Specialized Talents to Promote Municipal Development <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Shanghai branch of the Chinese Municipal Association held its inaugural meeting yesterday afternoon at the 9th floor of the Wing On Department Store. More than 100 members including Xi Yushu, Huang Boqiao, He Dekui, Zhao Zukang, Zhao Zengjue, and Gu Tiyang attended. Mayor Qian also personally attended to give instructions. Chairman Xi Yushu reported on the preparation process, saying that</p>
<p>When the Chairman Got Married in Beijing and Shanghai, he had summoned me personally, and provided detailed instructions on the association's organization and the selection of personnel for preparation. Mayor Qian said in his speech that he was humble and said that municipal administration was not his specialty. He hoped that after the establishment of the Municipal Association, people in the association who were concerned about municipal administration could provide assistance from time to time, so that the association could become a bridge between the people and the municipal government. Huang Boqiao said that Shanghai is</p>
<p>An International City. He hoped that the association could work hard and become a bridge between Shanghai and the international community. Zhao Zukang said that Shanghai was previously divided into several districts, each with different jurisdictions, and often only sought to cope within its own district without considering the city as a whole. For example, the recent heavy rains and flooding were due to the lack of an overall plan in the past, making it difficult to remedy today. In addition to hoping that the colleagues of the association would work with the municipal government, he also hoped that the association could become a bridge between the local and central governments. Tong Hangbai hoped to pay attention to the economic problems of the municipal government and how to</p>
<p>Distribute Fairly. Deputy Mayor He said that he was participating as a member and hoped that everyone would pay attention to the serious situation of the current labor unrest. He also said that times are different, and it is appropriate to study whether the excessive density of population between cities is appropriate. Then, the articles of association were passed, and a declaration of establishment was issued, stating that the purpose of the association was to connect municipal talents, study municipal academics, and promote municipal development. He hoped to enable the citizens and the municipal government to communicate their opinions, awaken the public's universal understanding of democratic politics, and arouse their interest in municipal research. The conference also paid respect to Chairman</p>
<p>Xiao with a telegram, saying: "Chairman: The rivers and mountains are forever stable, the cities are rebuilt, leading the founding of the country, and moving forward. This branch was officially established on March 17, remembering the hard work of eight years of struggle and feeling the heavy burden of the three mountains. Special telegram to pay tribute, endless admiration (omitted below)". Subsequently, Xi Yushu, Huang Boqiao, Zhao Zukang, Yin Tiyang, Zhao Zengjue, and others were elected as directors, and Pan Gongzhan, He Dekui, Shen Shihua, and others were elected as supervisors. The association has reached more than 200 members, and it is said that academic lectures and thematic seminars will be held soon, and publications will be compiled and printed.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper] The former US military gasoline depot at No. 520, Yuanfang Road, Daming Road, Hudong, next to the Gonghexiang Wharf, suddenly caught fire at 3:10 AM yesterday. More than ten pump trucks from the Central Fire Brigade rushed to the rescue, but unfortunately, the amount of gasoline stored was too large to be controlled. By about 9:00 AM, the fire had subsided slightly, but the embers had not been completely extinguished. It is reported that the oil in the depot was completely destroyed, resulting in huge losses. As a result, the three huge buildings in the depot were completely destroyed by the fire, causing the trams on Lines 7, 8, and 10 that ran through the area to be temporarily cut off. The police authorities are investigating the cause of the fire.</p>

<h3 id="e52">Social Services; Colleagues of Chuansha Elementary School Express Grievances About Working Selflessly on an Empty Stomach <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>Hoping that the Local Authorities Will Quickly Raise Funds to Maintain Education</p>
<p>Dear Editor: I am writing to your newspaper on behalf of my colleagues at the Elementary School in Chuansha County to reveal the treatment we get, which is so poor it’s unbelievable. The salary for this semester is $18,500, but we have not received it yet. Last year we only received $2,050, and we received it at the end of December when prices were high. The last three months of last year (November, December) and January of this year are still nowhere to be seen. Fortunately, the school gives us 60 pounds of rice a month, which we use to maintain our personal food intake. We think of the country, the society, and the children’s education and have never stopped or gone on strike. It’s because we do not stop or go on strike that the government ignores us. The authorities are just waiting for us to stop or go on strike. If we have a major responsibility but receive such meagre treatment, do you think it's okay? We beg you to write a postscript.</p>
<p>(Editor’s Note) What Mr. Chen described is likely not only the situation in Chuansha County. I dare say the same situation exists in many countries. It’s a fact that there is no funding after the war, but after the recovery, the local authorities must find ways. Education is a very important industry, and it is wrong for the young elementary school teachers to work selflessly on an empty stomach. We hope the local authorities find ways to maintain education costs, and we ask all the teachers to think about the bigger picture and not to cause any accidents, so as to safeguard the holy education industry.</p>

<p>(Note) Readers should try to be as succinct as possible with their inquiries. Lengthy, continuous writing is bothersome for both parties. It would be best to list in table format, such as on the first line the name, age, and gender; on the second line the cause of the illness and a brief history; and on the third line the points to be answered. This way, the editor and consultant can understand the inquiry at a glance and will not feel inconvenienced.</p>
<p>Wu Jisheng asks: My younger brother joined the war of resistance two years ago and was unfortunately injured. A bullet pierced both legs, entering through the right leg and exiting through the left. At that time, he immediately felt that the lower part of his left leg had lost sensation and could not move. After medical diagnosis, it was discovered that the right leg was unharmed, but the femur in the left leg was pierced and the lower part was fractured, damaging the nerves. He was placed in a splint and confined to bed for three months. Although the bones were connected, they were not perfectly aligned. After removing the splint, the knee was stiff. After a week of strong pressure, it could be bent. The area below the ankle still had no sensation and could not move, so he can only use crutches. Over time, the muscles in the knee contracted and could not be straightened again, and the muscles also became thinner. He is in great pain and requests advice on medical treatment.</p>
<p>Dr. Zhang Zhongming replies: For your brother's condition, an X-ray should first be taken to observe how the fractured femur in the left leg has healed. The inability to move the lower leg and the lack of sensation are due to muscle atrophy from prolonged disuse or local nerve damage. Massage and diathermy physical therapy should be used, which may be effective.</p>
<p>Sang Zibiao asks: My older sister has been feeling tired and weak in her limbs since last spring, and gradually felt unable to support herself. She went to Siming Hospital for diagnosis and treatment. According to the doctor's diagnosis, she had early-stage pulmonary tuberculosis and needed to have air injected. In June, the illness suddenly affected her intestines, causing continuous diarrhea and frequent, intermittent pain after eating. She was sent to Guangci Hospital for medical treatment. Over the past five months, her condition has worsened, and she has become as thin as a rail and cannot walk. Please ask a specialist doctor to give a good prescription, and I will never forget it.</p>
<p>Dr. Zhang Zhongming replies: Your older sister suffers from pulmonary tuberculosis and intestinal tuberculosis. It is necessary to focus on nutrition and increase resistance. Besides this, there is no particularly effective medicine.</p>
<p>Lu Shoufan asks: Five or six years ago, I suddenly suffered from a disease similar to eczema, which appeared on my buttocks. When it appears, it is unbearably itchy and must be treated with hot water. After scalding, the skin hardens, breaks when scratched, and oozes yellow water. Although I have had injections, taken medicine, applied ointment, and had X-ray and electrotherapy several times, I have not been cured. According to the doctor, it is a bacterial reproduction within the skin cells, which is quite difficult to treat. If your column can provide me with a good prescription, it would be a blessing to the public.</p>
<p>Dr. Zhang Zhongming replies: Apply 10% salicylic acid ointment to the itchy area, which may be effective. Your letter mentions that X-ray therapy was ineffective, which may be due to the number of treatments.</p>

<h3 id="e54">Financial Situation Gradually Stabilizes; Securities Speculation Becomes Heated; A Summary of Commercial and Financial Conditions for the Week <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>The financial trend last week was still relatively stable. The Bank of China continued to sell gold, and speculators have been greatly threatened. The market price has stabilized at around 1.6 million. The Bank of China's US dollar exchange rate has also been fixed at 2020 unchanged. However, the China stock unity bond had small fluctuations outside the market. Because the authorities claimed that the principal and interest of the unity bond would be repaid, another method was set, which was to wait until it was found out whether there was any robbery by enemies and puppets. This caused speculators to be greatly frustrated, triggering a tragic decline. Class C once plummeted to 1,250 yuan, but idle funds were picked up at low prices. At the same time, there was also news that the unity bond could be used to transfer new government bonds, so it soon rose again. On Wednesday, it once reached 1,900 yuan. Due to insufficient support, it once rebounded and then hovered downward. China stocks were unusually strong at the beginning of the week. American Asia Yarn Mill all hit new highs, and the Guangdong merchants actively moved forward, gradually moving towards a peak. Until Thursday, with the competition between bulls and bears, the fluctuations were huge. As a result, it was slightly lowered. On Friday, it returned to being strong. On Saturday, idle funds shifted, so the China stocks, which had been profitable for several days, became weak, and the foreign stocks, which had been idle for many days, changed to be strong. As for other commodities, the price of food rice rose sharply, which attracted the most attention. However, according to investigations by relevant parties, the recent stock of food in this city is very thick, enough for several months. Moreover, the Grain Administration Bureau has purchased large quantities of rice from rice-producing areas at home and abroad and transported them to Shanghai. Recently, due to continuous rainy days, the source is slightly scarce, and merchants are raising prices on the pretext. Furthermore, the participation of general idle funds and disrupting the market is also one of the reasons for the rising rice prices. It is said that the authorities will have new measures for the use of excess currency in order to guide idle funds back to the right track.</p>
<p>The raw silk on the last week’s question, initially stimulated by the rising wind of gold and stocks, the raw silk sales of the guest gang were good, and new buyers and short coverings were enthusiastic, and the market price rose. After entering, the actual digestion of the main customers such as Yuehan and other gangs turned sluggish, and the yarn factories received by the construction company opened night shifts and actively produced, so that the supply of chips in the market was abundant, and the situation turned sharply downstream. The highest for the entire week was 2.92 million for the 60s sunlight on Wednesday, and the lowest was 550,000 for the 10s nine fish on Saturday. In terms of support, the 20s special Shuangma fell 95,000 yuan from the previous week, the most significant. The others fell by 35,000 yuan for each level of yarn.</p>
<p>The cloth market situation is very mediocre and lacks color. As a result, there was no much change from the previous weekend, only a rise and fall of one or two thousand yuan. Because of the construction of the company’s procurement monopoly, especially the demand for fine velvet raw materials, the fine velvet market was strong and the coarse velvet market was weak.

<p>Since the opening of foreign exchange, import and export traders have a basis for purchasing and settling foreign exchange, so international trade is gradually developing. For example, silk, which is a major export of our country, has been continuously shipped out by Jardine Matheson for about 800 dans. Other foreign companies also have good suction. Dachang recently purchased 100 dans, with a maximum value of 2.75 million and a minimum value of 2.3 million. As for domestic sales, an average of about 20 dans are traded every day. As for tea exports, tea groups are actively carrying them out. Once the loan problem is resolved, they can implement procurement. There are now many trading companies operating tea exports.</p>

<h3 id="e60">A Discussion on the Value of Unified Bonds <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>— Yan Jiarong</p>
<p>Having recently read Mr. Shi's request in the "Reader's Opinions" section of your newspaper on the 13th, asking the authorities to clarify national debt policy, I feel that not only are public bond professionals distressed, but bondholders are even more confused. In my opinion, unified public bonds inherently possess an undeniable value both legally and ethically. I present four points below.</p>
<p>(1) In 1933, U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt devalued the U.S. dollar by 40%, mandating that all debts be repaid in legal tender. This caused dissatisfaction among national debt bondholders, leading to disputes with the government and the globally impactful "Gold Clause Cases." This case lasted two years and was adjudicated by the Supreme Court on February 18, 1935. The court divided national debts into two parts: (1) private debts should be repaid in legal tender as mandated; (2) the national debt portion should be repaid based on the currency value at the time of issuance. Following the precedent of allied nations, unified bonds should maintain their pre-war value.</p>
<p>(2) When the July 7th Incident broke out, the Ministry of Finance ordered the stock exchange to close (excluding institutions specializing in national debt and stock trading at the time). All buying and selling in the August-September period was settled at a price of 70 yuan. The Ministry of Finance maintained national credit, which is admirable. Since 70 yuan was established as the standard price at that time, it is reasonable to maintain this value without question.</p>
<p>(3) Since the victory of the War of Resistance, we have entered the path of national reconstruction. Various construction projects, development initiatives, and troop reductions all require significant expenditures. During this period of imbalance between national revenue and expenditure, there are only two options: increasing taxes and issuing national debt. To encourage the public to actively invest in and willingly purchase national debt, the original value of the bonds must be guaranteed. Otherwise, the public will view public bonds with suspicion, hindering future issuances.</p>
<p>(4) The 25th Year Unified Public Bonds were a reorganization and reissue of old bonds. Bondholders have already suffered losses, a number of incalculable proportions. They have endured this pain silently and without complaint, given the circumstances of the nation. Now that the War of Resistance has been won and the nation has joined the ranks of the great powers, with vast amounts of enemy and puppet assets confiscated, it would be unjust to subject bondholders to further unwarranted losses.</p>
<p>In conclusion, these four points sufficiently demonstrate that unified bonds should inherently maintain their original value. This is my opinion, and I hope that experts from across the country will enlighten me further.</p>
<p>[Note: The current market price of unified bonds has long exceeded its face value, and the increase is extremely high. The reasons given are often the same as Mr. Yan's. Therefore, it is printed as above. For the government's view, please refer to the discussions at the Second Plenary Session.]</p>
<h3 id="e61">Economic Briefs <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance's Cotton Yarn and Cloth Control Bureau was originally scheduled to close at the end of this month, but the closure work has not been completed. The closure period will therefore be extended.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Economic Affairs' Coal and Coke Management Office recently disclosed the following information on the supply of coal: February production was 89,880 tons, and the allocation was 8,919 tons. Due to the closure of most factories in Chongqing and the gradual decrease in population, Chongqing's coal reserves are becoming increasingly abundant, with many shipments to Yichang, about 3,000 tons per month.</p>
<p>According to responsible persons from the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the takeover of enemy property in Taiwan has been more successful. The Taiwan Administrative Governor's Office only dispatched a few people to take over economic enterprises and then instructed them to continue production before reorganizing them. This ensured that factory production was never interrupted. This differs greatly from the methods used to take over enemy property in Tianjin, Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Wuhan, resulting in much greater efficiency.</p>
<p>The United States has officially abolished wartime import and sales restrictions on hog bristles. Import regulations for cattle, sheep, horse tail hair, and horse manes have also been cancelled due to the end of the war. However, applications are still required. Current U.S. hog bristle reserves are sufficient for several months, and a large quantity of hog bristles is expected to be shipped from China between June and July of this year.</p>
<p>China's request to the United States for a large loan for Yangtze River water conservancy projects is contingent on China increasing silk production to 500,000 *dan* per year, the level of Japanese annual production. Currently, China's total annual silk production is only about 110,000 *dan*. The central authorities are planning to expand raw silk production to meet international market demand.</p>
<p>In addition to establishing a real estate department, the Central Trust Bureau has recently established a barter trade department to expand foreign trade. The main tasks are to handle the export of mineral products from the Resource Commission and the export of tung oil, Shantou oil, and hog bristles from the Trade Commission's Reconstruction Corporation.</p>
<p>According to sources from British Overseas Airways Corporation in Shanghai, the company will open a new route from Hong Kong to Japan, with a stopover in Shanghai. It is reported that a group of key personnel and experts from the company have arrived in Shanghai and are actively preparing. This is expected to be the first step in the relationship between the British aviation industry and our country.</p>

<p>The Hong Kong Far East United Shipping Bureau has officially announced its closure, with management returning to the original shipping companies. Butterfield &amp; Swire Shipping Company has begun operations at its original location, actively preparing for business recovery. The company manages two major groups of ships, "Blue Funnel Line" and "China Navigation Company". "Blue Funnel Line" ships are responsible for transportation between Hong Kong and the United Kingdom and its territories. Five major routes have been decided: Australia Route, London Route, Pacific Route, New York Route, and Liverpool Route. However, there are very few "Blue Funnel Line" ships currently available. The only ships capable of operating are the *Adis* sailing to Australia (via Singapore) and the *Eridanus* sailing the Pacific Route to Vancouver. The other routes will have to wait for new ships to arrive in Hong Kong before they can be assigned. Therefore, there is currently only one sailing per month. The "China Navigation Company" ships suffered heavy losses during the war. There are now only fourteen ships, all between 1,500 and 2,000 tons. The routes are mainly coastal routes to Shantou, Shanghai, Xiamen, Guangzhou, Tianjin, etc., and overseas routes to Singapore, Haiphong, Siam, etc. The following routes have been assigned for inauguration: Guiyang (Hong Kong-Shantou route has passenger seats), Shandong (Hong Kong-Shanghai route has no passenger seats), Yuezhou (Shanghai-Haiphong route has no passenger seats), Jinan (Hong Kong, Shanghai, Tianjin routes have passenger seats), Hanyang (Hong Kong-Shanghai route has no passenger seats), Niuzhuang (Hong Kong-Shanghai route has no passenger seats), Beihai (no passenger seats in Shanghai), Fuzhou (Shanghai-Hong Kong route has no passenger seats), Shengjing (route to be determined, has passenger seats), Foshan (Hong Kong-Guangzhou route has passenger seats), Nanchang (Hong Kong-Vietnam route has no passenger seats), Suiyang (has passenger seats on the way to Hong Kong), Ninghai (no passenger seats in Shanghai), Anhui (Hong Kong-Singapore route has passenger seats, undergoing repairs in the dock), fourteen ships in total. However, only the Hong Kong-Shantou, Hong Kong-Shanghai, Hong Kong-Guangzhou, and Hong Kong-Siam routes are currently operating. The Hong Kong-Xiamen and Hong Kong-Singapore routes can be restored soon, depending on whether there is cargo transportation after the routes are restored. The Taikoo Dockyard is actively recovering and has begun repairing ships. If trade in various regions is smooth in the short term, each route will have at least one or two ships operating.</p>
<h3 id="e64">On the Issue of Returning Cotton Cloth: A Discussion on the Handling of Enemy and Puppet Assets <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Shaozu</p>
<p>The issue of returning surplus cotton cloth, although part of the handling of enemy property cases, has already attracted public attention. If this situation persists in a state of uncertainty, it cannot be said that it will not affect the clothing of the people of Shanghai. The Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau initially approved the issuance of instructions, but then the 49th meeting of the Enemy and Puppet Property Review Committee reversed the decision, stating that the requisition of cotton cloth by the Puppet Cotton Association had taken place over a long period, and that since the receipt of the cotton cloth, much of it had been moved or sold, making it impossible to verify. The review resulted in a decision that it would be difficult to approve the return. (As reported in the news section of this newspaper.) Government agencies issuing contradictory approvals to the people only undermine public confidence in the government. Regardless, the fact that businesses in this city were forced to buy cotton cloth by the enemy and puppets shows a clear pattern of coercion and duress, rather than voluntary transactions or free will. Legally, the owners are entitled to request its return. According to Article 92 of the Civil Code, a declaration of intent made under duress may be revoked. Further, according to the interpretation of the law, this is not limited to gratuitous acts. Remunerated acts can also be subject to the provision. Therefore, regardless of whether the act is remunerated or unremunerated, the declaration of intent may be revoked, as the law does not stipulate that the declarant must not receive consideration for the act to be invalid or revocable. Furthermore, Article 4, Paragraph 1 of the Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Measures states: "Property originally belonging to citizens of this country, allied nations, or friendly nations that was forcibly seized by Japan should be returned to the original owner, provided that clear and reliable evidence is available." This provision is based on the principle of freedom of will in civil law. The Bureau has already submitted the cotton cloth return case to the Legal Advisory Committee for discussion, and it has been deemed that, in accordance with the handling measures and legal viewpoints, the return should be approved. The review committee's decision to suddenly reject the people's request is confusing. Is it that the handling measures are not applicable to cotton cloth? Or do the review agency and the handling agency have differing opinions on the handling measures that have been revised and promulgated? This leaves the people at a loss.</p>
<p>As for the review opinions of the 49th review meeting, the points regarding the impossibility of verifying the cotton cloth purchased in the past due to the fact that much of it has been moved or sold since its receipt are not sufficient to be factual obstacles to the request for return. Legally, whether a property is a specific item or a non-specific item, a replaceable item or a non-replaceable item, its owner is entitled to request its return if it has been taken illegally. Cotton cloth is a non-specific item, and it is also a replaceable item that can be dealt with using items of the same type, quantity, and quality. Furthermore, in this case, the businesses that were forcibly bought out are willing to take back their remaining cotton cloth according to the proportion of their share. Since there is no dispute between the interested parties, the authorities do not need to verify the original item as the subject matter of the return. In fact, there are no difficulties. In short, the merchants' request to retrieve the surplus amount of this cotton cloth does not violate the law, is not contrary to the handling measures, and there are no difficulties in fact. In order to alleviate the hardships of the people, the authorities have the necessity to return it.</p>

<h3 id="e65">Ministry of Education Supervisors' Inspection Guidelines: Vice Minister Hang Reviews Inspection Reports from Various Supervisors <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent] Before the war, the Ministry of Education's Supervisory Office had fewer than ten supervisors. During the War of Resistance, in 1940 (Republic Year 29), due to the promulgation of the National Education Implementation Act, each province and city had a five-year plan to promote national education. The Ministry of Education needed many personnel for supervisory work, so it amended the Education Organization Regulations.</p>
<p>Qualifications of Supervisors: Regarding supervisors, there were six hired supervisors, four reappointed supervisors, and thirty assigned supervisors. Hired and senior supervisors received the same treatment, but the qualifications for hired supervisors were generally that they had served as presidents of colleges or universities, heads of education departments, or equivalent positions. Hired and senior supervisors were assigned areas of inspection by the Ministry, mostly related to higher education matters above the college level. Assigned supervisors generally inspected primary and secondary schools and local education.</p>
<p>Scope of Inspection: Pei Lin, after taking office as president of Henan University when the War of Resistance was won, is now in the Ministry of Education with only hired supervisors Hao Gengsheng, Peng Baichuan, and Ren Tai. The senior supervisors are Zhong Daozan, Chen Dongyuan, Shen Yizhen, and Huang Longxian. Of the thirty assigned supervisors who have departed for inspection, Li Zhigang is inspecting education in Peiping and Tianjin, Zhang Danxiang is inspecting Jiangsu and Nanjing, Ding Xianzeng is inspecting Shanghai and Nanjing, Chen Zongying is inspecting Fujian and Taiwan, Qiu He is inspecting Jiangxi and Hunan, Cai Ruoshui is inspecting Anhui, and Cheng Kuanzheng is inspecting local education in Zhejiang and Shanghai. It is also heard that in order to handle daily affairs, the Supervisory Office must have one member in charge each time. The current person in charge is Supervisor Zhong Daozan.</p>
<p>Meeting for Review: [Also reported] Vice Minister Hang of the Ministry of Education recently convened a meeting in Nanjing for various supervisors in Beijing to review their inspection reports, with department heads and above also in attendance. Supervisor Cai Ruoshui reported on the inspection of education in northern Anhui, and Supervisors Ding Xianzeng and Zhang Danxiang reported on the completion of inspections of education in Nanjing City. It is heard that Supervisor Cheng Kuanzheng has already submitted a report to the Ministry, having inspected education in Hangzhou and Jinhua, and is now inspecting Lanxi. Supervisor Cai Ruoshui must still go to southern Anhui for inspection. Supervisors Ding Xianzeng and Zhang Danxiang must still go to Jiangsu for inspection. It is also heard that Senior Supervisor Shen Yizhen, currently in Chongqing, will come to Beijing to work at the Ministry within days. (Fool)</p>

<p>[Chongqing Dispatch] The Victory Cup Basketball Open Tournament organized by the Chongqing Sports Association includes five teams in the senior division: Fourth Motor Transport Battalion, CU Combined Team, Resurrection, Tianjian, and Central Cadre School. The regular division includes sixteen teams: Liangyou, Xiaoguang, Qingquan, Police Third, Public Works Bureau, Fourth Motor Transport Battalion B, CU Changfeng, China University, Vitality, Dove Team, China-India, Jianglian, Dagong Daily, and Engineering Committee. The high school boys division includes six teams: CU Affiliated High School, Nutao, Municipal Normal School, Cadre School Affiliated High School, Ningzhong, and Qiujing. The high school girls division includes five teams: Municipal Girls' High School, Central Cadre Affiliated High School, Qiujing, Wende, and Municipal Normal School. The first game will be held on March 11th at the East Sichuan Normal School Sports Association field. Mayor Zhang Dulun will be invited to perform the opening ceremony. The schedule includes Police Third vs. Qingquan in the regular division, and Resurrection vs. Central Cadre in the senior division. Resurrection defeated Central Cadre easily, and Police Third defeated Qingquan. It is expected to end by the end of May. The Fourth Motor Transport Battalion in the senior division has famous players such as Wang Shixuan and Liao Dihang, and has always held the top position in Chongqing. The CU Combined Team is composed of CU teachers and students, with strong players Wang Liquan and Ren Shuheng. Their performance is excellent and they once defeated the National Association. This time, they are the only strong opponent of the Fourth Motor Transport Battalion in the senior division. Liang Yunming and Zhou Dayun of the Resurrection team have not been seen on the court, and their strength has been greatly reduced. They are probably no match for the Fourth Motor Transport Battalion and the CU Combined Team. The Changfeng team of CU is strong in the regular division, but it is unknown who will emerge victorious. The strength of the high school boys and girls teams is average because Nankai did not participate.</p>

<p>National Teachers College Establishes Educational Materials Office</p>
<p>Summary of Plans The main points of the educational materials office's work plan are as follows: (1) Hire several special instructors and correspondents from domestic and foreign educational and cultural institutions to organize an educational communication network to facilitate the supply of materials. (2) Collect and purchase materials on education at all levels across the country since the Anti-Japanese War. (3) Design and draw various charts to show the actual situation and problems of education at all levels in each year for the research of teachers and students of the college and for the reference of people in the education field. (4) Translate the aforementioned materials and charts into English for the reference of foreign educational and cultural institutions. (5) Clip and paste educational news and treatises published in newspapers. (6) Carry out cooperation matters with the Teachers College of Columbia University: A. Compile and exchange domestic and foreign educational bibliographies. B. Purchase two copies of various educational materials, one for exchange and one for self-preservation. C. Organize and keep the materials exchanged by Columbia University.</p>
<p>Brief Account of Work The Educational Materials Office has not been established for a long time, and all work is in its initial stage. Due to the limitations of objective conditions during the war, it is not easy to fully develop the original plan. The following is a brief description of the work that the office has already started to clarify the current situation: (1) Subscribe to Newspapers: The office has searched for all important newspapers in major cities. In addition to collecting materials, it has a scheduled opening time every day for public exhibition, and many teachers and students come to the office to consult them. (2) Solicit and Purchase Books and Periodicals: The office sent letters to educational administrative and publishing institutions across the country to solicit and purchase publications of an educational nature; and entrusted educational and cultural figures in various places to search for and purchase them on their behalf. Subsequently, it received reply letters from the Education Department and other institutions, donating more than 600 kinds of educational laws, statistics, plans, reports, magazines, and books. It also directly selected and purchased various educational books and magazines from various bookstores. (3) Draw Charts: The office referred to the statistics on education and created new types of school system diagrams and educational opportunity distribution charts. It has now completed six diagrams of the school systems and educational opportunity distribution of China, Japan, the United States, France, Italy, and the United Kingdom. The diagrams of the school system and educational opportunity distribution of Denmark are being drawn. In addition, in order to meet the needs of teaching, it has drawn diagrams of the organizational relationships at all levels of the county, a table of the evolution of education in various periods of human history, an activity table for the four grades of the primary school department of national schools, a diagram of the current school system in China, a diagram of the school system in Switzerland, a diagram of the school system in Denmark, a diagram of the relationship between gene combination and heredity (three diagrams), a diagram of the heredity of sex-linked traits, a diagram of the determination of personality and gender, and a diagram of cell reproduction and division, a total of twelve diagrams. (4) Carry out Exchanges: The China school system and the chart of abandoning weaknesses and using strengths to distribute opportunities created by the office have been redrawn with the latest statistical figures and a large English explanation. Director Zhu also personally wrote an English paper on Chinese national education, and Professor Zhu Youxu, director of the Department of Education of the college and instructor of the office, wrote an English paper on Chinese secondary education. They will be sent to Columbia University in the United States as the first batch of exchange materials. In addition, the various educational books and periodicals purchased by the office have been prepared as another set for Columbia University, and will be shipped to the United States by mail after sea transportation is smooth. The weekly magazines donated and purchased by Columbia University will also be shipped in batches at that time. In addition, (5) clipping news, (6) compiling bibliographies, and (7) collecting materials are also being actively promoted. In short, although the progress of various tasks of the Educational Materials Office is extremely difficult in the wartime environment, all staff members have worked hard and have gradually achieved results. Now that the Anti-Japanese War has ended victoriously and the objective conditions after the war have improved, the office will not only gradually complete the established plan, but also expand the scope of work in the hope of contributing to educational research. If people in the national educational and cultural circles cooperate, advocate, and provide assistance in various ways, then the development of this new undertaking of international culture is unlimited.</p>

<h3 id="e80">Attlee and Bevin Broadcast to the Business World to Form a Production General Staff <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Xueyan from London</p>
<p>This newspaper's 2nd day airmail</p>
<p>The most important issue internally in Britain right now is how to speed up production and restore Britain's prosperity. Seeing that American goods are already being sold to the world market, while British factories are still struggling with coal shortages and labor shortages, people can't help but panic. Prime Minister Attlee gave a pep talk to the nation on the evening of March 3rd, appealing to business people and laborers to do their best to increase production. At the same time, during the second week of March, from Attlee to Bevin and Morrison, a group of important people will all come forward to give public speeches and review the production situation in Britain. British government officials usually express their opinions in the upper and lower houses of Parliament, and there are not many broadcasts, let alone timely and festive broadcasts, so this large-scale mobilization can be regarded as the greatest effort. In addition, the business and labor circles are also mobilizing at the same time to form a national production general staff in the British business world. Its task is to provide advice to the government on general production policies and the direction of production priority. Its members are composed of labor representatives and factory owners, each accounting for half of the number. In the future, this organization will definitely make more contributions to increasing British production.</p>
<p>Monotonous Recipes Cause Complaints</p>
<p>After a great war, there must be a lean year. This saying is the same in ancient and modern times, at home and abroad. The war ended last year, and now there is famine everywhere. The British food list was already too monotonous, and there were complaints from all sides. However, seeing the famine situation in India and the British-occupied areas of Germany, it is really pitiful. The British Isles are fortunate to be spared, and they can be content and comforted by this. Among the famine areas, the famine in Europe is the most concerning to London, because it is close to the water tower. It is said that there is no way to deal with the situation in Germany within the British-occupied area, and it can only reduce the daily food ration per person. The amount of food that each person can get now is 1,550 calories per day. The calories normally needed to maintain health are 2,000 calories, so the current standard is not enough to maintain health. If it is reduced by another one-third, it can only barely maintain until starvation. However, there is no solution to this situation, so not only will it not be improved in the near future, but it may also need to be shortened further. According to general estimates, it may once be necessary to reduce the current ration per person by two-thirds. In other words, each person can only eat two slices of thin bread and a sweet potato every day. The situation is really serious, so the commander-in-chief of the British occupying forces, Montgomery, urgently requested the British government to quickly allocate ships to transport food for emergency relief, and see if there will be a way to improve the situation in the future.</p>
<p>London Raises the Housing Problem</p>
<p>The housing problem is extremely serious in Britain. All serious problems will inevitably become the focus of debate between the Conservative and Labour parties. Recently, in the London City Council, the issue of housing construction has been raised again due to the competition for two seats. The Conservative Party said that the Labour Party promised to solve the housing problem when it was campaigning last year, but now that it has been in power for half a year, it is clear that it cannot fulfill its promise. But the Labour Party said that the Labour Party has built more houses in half a year in power than the Conservative Party has built in ten years, and then cited many figures. From a practical point of view, both sides are right. There is no doubt that the severity of the housing problem in Britain this year is still far from being solved. However, the Labour Party said that it has achieved better results in its half-year term than the Conservative Party in ten years, which is also reasonable, because the housing problem was not a problem before, so construction was a private matter and not the concern of the government, so naturally there was no housing. During the war, although housing had become a problem, the government did not have time for this, so it did not build housing either. It was not until the Labour Party came to power last year that it listed housing construction as one of the most important policies, so it is natural that the results are better than the Conservative Party.</p>
<p>The conflict between the two parties on the construction issue is not limited to this. The Conservative Party believes that private construction companies are large in scale and highly efficient, so the government should entrust them with the problem and subsidize them. The Labour Party is against it, believing that this move is to make private companies rich, so it advocates that the government should directly hire workers to handle it. According to the housing problem report recently released by Health Minister Bevin, a total of 1,909 houses have been built in the six months since the Labour Party came to power. Among them, 1,116 were built by private companies, and 352 were built by government workers. Conservative newspapers sarcastically headlined, "Bevin's gang has only built 352 houses so far." Newspapers have been reporting on anti-British incidents in India, Egypt, and other places, demanding the withdrawal of British troops. A newspaper very keenly thought of the housing problem and joked that London's landladies must be very happy to hear these news, because British people from all over the world are being driven back home, and renting out houses must be a good deal.</p>
<p>Clothing Allocation Points Increased</p>
<p>Although the recovery of British industry is considered very slow, from the government and parliament to the opinions of newspapers and magazines, they are all discussing this issue and worrying about how to restore British prosperity. But in reality, London today has made obvious progress compared to the autumn and winter of last year. For example, the number of points for the clothing rationing system has been generally increased by four points per quarter since March, that is, previously each person only got 20 points per quarter, but now they can get 24 points. At the same time, the value of points has been increased for many items. For example, a woman's coat used to require 18 points, but now it only requires 12 points. In addition, many special wartime restrictions have also been lifted in March, such as the number of pockets and buttons that can be made on a man's suit, which were limited during the war to save materials. As a result of the restrictions, London suits did not have buttons on the cuffs, because the buttons on the cuffs were purely decorative, and naturally there was no right to exist during the war. However, since March, this restriction has also been lifted. No one will care how many buttons you like to put on your suit or how many pockets you sew on. In addition, there were restrictions on the height of women's shoe heels during the war. From March, this restriction has also been lifted. Women's shoe heels can be as high as they can reach the sky. It is said that you can do whatever you want, and the country will no longer bother you to save heel materials.</p>
<p>Anti-Franco Is Already a Trend</p>
<p>With the defeat of the Axis powers, Fascism is also about to die. Now, in the whole world, the only remaining remnant that is still playing the Fascist card is the Franco regime in Spain. At the same time, it has also become the object of scorn from all countries in the world. Since the United Nations Conference passed a resolution to sever ties with the Franco regime, the British Trades Union Congress issued a declaration cursing the Franco regime and demanding that the government sever ties with it. Tomorrow, the Socialist Party in Brussels will launch a demonstration against Franco. The left-leaning parties in France and the Spanish republicans who have fled overseas curse Franco every time, as if they are not satisfied if they don't curse him once. But strangely enough, Franco seems to be very proficient in the philosophy of small countries. He laughs at the curses, and I will be an official myself. He calls himself an orphan in Madrid, and his position as head of state seems to be very stable. The people who curse him can only do so outside the borders of Spain. Within the borders of Spain, at least for the time being, they cannot move him at all. Several Spanish revolutionaries who participated in the war against Germany in France recently sneaked into the Spanish border and plotted to do something, but Franco caught them and dealt with them according to the law. This really touched the public outrage in the world. France took the lead in proposing that the Franco regime be submitted to the United Nations Security Council for discussion, but France is not a big deal. If France really wants to take action, as the French Foreign Minister told the French Parliament, it must first obtain the consent of Britain and the United States, so as long as Britain and the United States do not agree, Franco can still be indifferent. Now the United States suddenly advocates taking action. It advocates that the United States, Britain, and France consult with each other to form a caretaker government based on broad democratic foundations, so that if the Franco regime suddenly dies, the original team can send people to Spain to handle the aftermath. Although this move does not directly overthrow the Franco regime with the power of the United States, Britain, and France, and establish another government, it assumes that the Franco regime will fall, and clearly shows the sympathy of the United States, Britain, and France on the new government's side, so it is very likely that it will provide assistance and convenience. If the United States, Britain, and France really take action, Franco may not be able to support it. Among these three countries, Britain had previously announced that it did not advocate overthrowing the Franco regime by external force, but that the Spanish people should work hard on their own. The effect of this statement was tantamount to announcing a non-aggression promise to Franco, so Franco was very relieved in the past six months. But now the United States has come out to lead, and has published ten documents captured in Germany, pointing out Franco's collusion with Hitler and others during the war, and that Franco has requested the occupation of Gibraltar, etc. As a result, the British government has also changed its attitude and joined the joint declaration of the United States, Britain, and France, encouraging the Spanish people to rise up peacefully and take the power of Franco and form a caretaker government based on democracy. Franco's regime, at this point, may not be able to support it any longer. Also, Archbishop Spellman of New York is currently in Madrid on the orders of the Pope, and it is unknown whether he is having any practical contact. (March 2nd)</p>
<h3 id="e81">Major Anglo-Soviet Debate: Existing Twenty-Year Treaty of Friendship, Bevin Proposes Extension to Fifty Years <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>For the past month or two, the focus of attention in London has been the United Nations conference. Within the UN conference, the most attention-grabbing events have been the series of major debates in the Security Council. These included the Iran-Soviet dispute, the Soviet proposal for the withdrawal of British troops from Greece, the Ukrainian request for the UN to send an investigation team to determine if British troops in the Dutch East Indies endangered international peace, and the joint request by Syria and Lebanon for the withdrawal of foreign troops from their countries. With the exception of the last proposal, the others were all focal points of contention between Britain and the Soviet Union. Fortunately, Britain prevailed in these debates, and the Security Council's final decisions were, in effect, based on British opinions. With the end of the conference, the British felt relieved, as if the world could finally be at peace. There was an opportunity to carefully reflect on the consequences of these Anglo-Soviet disputes.</p>
<p>Diplomatic Debate Continues Non-Stop for Two Days</p>
<p>During the UN conference, Foreign Secretary Bevin was too busy, so the parliament had no time to debate diplomatic issues. Now that the conference has ended this week, the parliament scheduled the 20th and 21st as two whole days to exclusively debate diplomatic events. The focus of the debate naturally centered again on Anglo-Soviet relations. Both the ruling and opposition parties expressed many opinions, unanimously acknowledging that Anglo-Soviet relations were not satisfactory, and also unanimously admitting that this was a regrettable phenomenon. British newspapers also published editorials these past two days, commenting on Anglo-Soviet relations, and expressing opinions similar to those in parliament, which clearly shows how anxious Britain is about the unsatisfactory state of Anglo-Soviet relations.</p>
<p>The debate was initiated by former Minister of State for Near Eastern Affairs, MacMillan (from the opposition party), who highly praised Foreign Secretary Bevin's success in the UN Security Council. Many people then spoke, the most important being Minister of State Noel-Baker, former Foreign Secretary and current opposition leader Eden, and current Foreign Secretary Bevin. Although the positions of the two parties differed, their opinions on policy towards the Soviet Union were almost identical. Therefore, it was less of a debate and more of a clarification of Britain's unified position on the Soviet Union. In summary, they hoped that the Soviet Union would understand Britain's attitude towards it, believe in Britain's goodwill, and appreciate Britain's sincere desire to cooperate. At the same time, Britain also believed in the Soviet Union's sincerity in wanting to cooperate with each other in the post-war world. However, as Eden said, "The Soviet Union needs cooperation, but the cooperation it needs seems only to be on its terms. This is not going to work; sooner or later, it will lead us into difficulties." Eden also said, "The Soviet Union's allies cannot tolerate the Soviet Union constantly claiming it needs unity, almost magically, while pursuing its own policies, completely disregarding the feelings and interests of its allies."</p>
<p>Anglo-Soviet War Seems Impossible</p>
<p>Indeed, it is absolutely certain that Britain and the Soviet Union need to live in peace and cooperate with each other today. Both sides understand this very well; there is no ambiguity. The only problem is how to reconcile interests, especially not to let one country pursue its own narrow interests while disregarding the interests of the other. If anyone believes that today's Anglo-Soviet conflicts will lead to war, they are fools. At least in the short term, it is not only impossible but also unimaginable. In fact, many of the tense Anglo-Soviet conflicts are based on the belief that Britain and the Soviet Union will not go to war. For example, Foreign Secretary Bevin, in response to Eden's debate, said, "Some say that we are inclined to go to war with the Soviet Union, or that we are bound to do so, but I cannot imagine Britain and the Soviet Union going to war under any circumstances. The Soviet Union's territory, from the Kuril Islands to its satellite countries, is an incomparably large continental country. I don't know what we have to fight over. This idea has never entered my mind, and I am sure it has not entered the minds of any of my colleagues in the government." Bevin even said that when he went to Moscow at the end of last year, he explained Britain's friendly intentions towards the Soviet Union to the Soviet leaders. He suggested to the Soviet side, "We now have a twenty-year treaty of friendship between us. If you are willing, we can extend the twenty years to fifty years."</p>
<p>We believe that Bevin's words are sincere and frank. If we carefully analyze the debate in parliament by both the ruling and opposition parties in Britain over the past two days, and the resulting newspaper commentary, we can clearly see that the entire country acknowledges that Anglo-Soviet relations are not currently good. At the same time, even if relations are bad, they believe that they will not immediately lead to war, because neither side wants this. Britain, in its position, is confident that it harbors no hostility towards the Soviet Union, and especially has no intention of supporting its neighboring small countries to deliberately make things difficult for the Soviet Union, hoping that the Soviet Union will not be suspicious. Conversely, Britain also has many interests around the world and hopes that the Soviet Union will also take them into account and respect them. Britain feels that it has made many concessions to the Soviet Union, but there are also limits to what it can concede. For example, the Iranian issue is one such limit. Britain hopes to adjust relations with the Soviet Union, but Britain's position on what it cannot concede is also very firm. In the post-war world, Britain sincerely hopes to have friendly cooperation with the Soviet Union. But the problem is whether there is a way to adjust where interests conflict.</p>
<p>Speaking of Anglo-Soviet conflicts, we know that this is an old story going back half a century. Whenever the two countries' power simultaneously expands, interests will intersect and conflicts will arise. The locations of the conflicts, in the era of Imperial Russia, stretched from the Near East all the way to the Far East. The Anglo-Japanese Alliance at the beginning of this century was the result of Britain's desire to use the power of a newly emerging Japan to restrain the development of Imperial Russia's power in the Far East. In the Near East, Anglo-Soviet relations also added many disputes to diplomatic history. Until the outbreak of World War I, the Soviet Union underwent a revolution and was busy with internal problems, having no time to expand outward. Therefore, although Anglo-Soviet relations did not improve much, the conflicts of interest caused by mutual expansion of power temporarily came to a standstill. During the second half of World War II, Britain and the Soviet Union became allies, and during the war, they cooperated seamlessly, and relations were indeed friendly. However, after Germany was defeated, the Soviet Union took advantage of its victory to seek development in all directions, and then the contradictions and conflicts between Britain and the Soviet Union arose again. From the disputes over the problems of the Polish, Yugoslav, and other governments-in-exile, to the pile of debates in the recent UN conference, it can be considered to have reached its peak. We know that the Five Foreign Ministers Conference held in London last year ended without results. Bevin had a direct conflict with Molotov at this conference. By the end of the year, the Three Foreign Ministers Conference was held in Moscow. Regardless of what officials said, the Three Foreign Ministers Conference was actually to remedy the failure of the Five Foreign Ministers Conference and was a preparatory conference for the eve of the UN conference, seeking coordination among the three major powers. As a result of the conference, Moscow believed that it was very successful because the Soviet Union's requests were largely achieved. Washington also considered it quite satisfactory; compromises had been reached. However, the public opinion in London generally expressed dissatisfaction and was quite saddened. As for the reason for the dissatisfaction, Britain believed that the Moscow conference was only a mutual compromise between the United States and the Soviet Union, and Britain's participation was only incidental. Britain's hopes were completely ignored, and the Soviet Union was unwilling to make any concessions to Britain. When the Moscow conference was convened, the independence movement in northern Iran had a raging momentum. Therefore, Britain had high hopes for the Moscow conference, hoping to find a solution to the problem in the talks. During the conference, the British ambassador to Iran also specially rushed to the Soviet capital to be available for consultation. However, as a result of the Soviet Union's unexpectedly tough attitude, Britain's original hopes could not be achieved at all. Until the Iranian issue was raised in the Security Council at this UN conference, the Soviet Union finally admitted that Iran and the Soviet Union would continue to negotiate directly and would report to the UN in the future. Following the Greek, Indonesian, and other cases, Britain was considered very successful. Therefore, the frustration that Britain had suffered in Moscow seemed to be vented, and now it can calmly review Anglo-Soviet relations and seek to remedy the shortcomings in diplomatic relations.</p>
<p>The Biggest Key to Anglo-Soviet Conflict</p>
<p>The Near East is indeed Britain's lifeline to India. The integrity of the British Empire depends on this lifeline. Therefore, it is natural for Britain to value the safety of this transportation line and not allow major powers to threaten it. Conversely, the Soviet Union is seeking warm-water ports everywhere, and Iran is its bridge to the Persian Gulf and the Indian Ocean. The Soviet Union has never let go of this when it has the power. As early as the era of Imperial Russia in 1907, Britain and Russia, as a result of the conflict of interests in Persia, Afghanistan, India, and other areas, had signed an agreement. Among them, the part about Persia can be used as a reference for our Iranian problem today. According to the Anglo-Russian Agreement of 1907, the sphere of influence of Persia was divided into three parts: the northern part, including Tehran and Isfahan, was the sphere of influence of Imperial Russia; the central part was a buffer zone; and the coastal areas, including Bandar Abbas leading to the Persian Gulf and Seistan, the passage leading to India and Adakhan, were the sphere of influence of Britain. If we compare this treaty's provisions with the division of Anglo-Soviet spheres of influence in Iran today, it seems that Britain's sphere of influence today is even larger than it was then. However, we should not forget that the Anglo-Russian Agreement of 1907 was only one of many agreements. The division of spheres of influence at that time was the result of various trade-offs. In analyzing the conflict between Britain and the Soviet Union in Iran today, we should not be too rigid in adhering to this view. It is said that Bevin's proposed method for resolving the Iranian dispute at the Moscow conference was for Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union to send a delegation to investigate within the Soviet military-occupied area, but this was rejected by the Soviet side. According to Bevin's statement in parliament on the 21st, he still supports the idea of sending an investigation team in the future if possible. From the method proposed by Britain, it has been very moderate from the beginning. In the future, if the conditions are right, Britain and the Soviet Union may still be able to compromise in Iran.</p>
<p>Bevin Reviews Soviet-Turkish Border</p>
<p>The second point of conflict between Britain and the Soviet Union in the Near East is in Turkey. We remember that when the Three Foreign Ministers met in Moscow, the Soviet newspapers suddenly attacked Turkey very strongly. Bevin called it a war of nerves. Later, Turkey's attitude became firm, and it seemed quieter. This time, when reviewing Anglo-Soviet relations, Bevin also talked about the Turkish issue. He said, "It is regrettable that the Soviet-Turkish border is still a matter of controversy." As for the Dardanelles Strait, he said that Britain is "prepared to consider jointly revising the Montreux Convention by Turkey and the Soviet Union themselves or with the participation of other allies. In the revision, we urgently hope to maintain the international nature of the waterway." This shows that the Turkish issue may be under discussion, and it also illustrates the limit of Britain's concessions. According to a report from American newspapers, when the five foreign ministers were drafting the peace treaties with Italy and other countries, the Soviet Union demanded that Tripolitania be a Soviet trusteeship, otherwise it demanded to occupy the Dodecanese Islands. If this statement is true and realized, then Anglo-Soviet conflicts may sow new seeds of conflict in the Mediterranean region in the future. From the above review, we can see that the Anglo-Soviet conflict of interests is not accidental, but it can all be resolved through negotiations with a spirit of mutual concession. When debating, the situation is turbulent because both sides are deeply convinced that it will not lead to war. Especially since we know that Britain is a pragmatic nation, why not seek a solution through diplomatic means if there are problems that can be discussed? Therefore, after a period of tension, it is very likely that Britain and the Soviet Union will seek a compromise and understanding in diplomacy. (February 23rd)</p>
<h3 id="e82">Sea Wall at Jinshanwei Collapses, Urgent Repairs Needed! <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>[Our paper's dispatch on the 16th] The Jinshanwei sea wall in Jiangsu Province, where the borders of Songjiang and Jinshan counties meet, the embankment is the point where the Beijing-Hangzhou National Highway is impacted by the flow of Hangzhou Bay, and the water force is comparable to Haining in Zhejiang Province. Since the enemy troops landed in the area in the 26th year of the Republic [1937], the seawall construction has fallen into disrepair, and the embankment body has been collapsing day by day, especially at the two sites of Fangdun and the Weijiadun Bathing Beach, which are the most dangerous. The embankment body of the Fangdun section has been destroyed. The piles that used to protect the embankment were close to the embankment body, but now, because of the crumbling of the stone, the embankment body is collapsing day by day and is far away from the embankment piles. The scouring and erosion are very worrying. (See Figure Two.) As for the Qijiadun section, its steel and concrete construction has also been destroyed. This project was built in the 22nd year of the Republic [1933], originally filled with stones, flush with the embankment surface, but now many places have been destroyed by flushing, and the embankment body is gradually collapsing, which shows the urgency of the water force. (See Figure Two.) Once the above two places collapse, not only will the national highway be interrupted, but the residents of several counties along the coast will be in a flooded country. More than one million acres of rice-producing farmland in Pudong and Punan will be irrigated by saltwater, making it impossible to cultivate, and the impact on the people's food supply is unimaginable. It is heard that all parties are hoping to purchase materials and start construction as soon as possible to avoid future troubles. It is heard that the authorities are planning emergency repair strategies.</p>

<p>Since the situation in Iran took a sharp turn for the worse, and after Churchill and Stalin turned against each other, the British have developed a dual psychology: on the one hand, they are quite willing to face reality, no matter how unpleasant the reality is; on the other hand, they do not believe that the relationship between Britain and the Soviet Union has been as dark as Stalin has said. What the British most hope for is to clarify the current crisis. What the British are most concerned about is the true goal of Moscow. The movement of the Red Army within Iran, the discord between the great powers, are secondary. The general public expects that Foreign Secretary Bevin will be able to obtain answers to the following questions that trouble him most after the UN Security Council convenes on March 25: (1) To what extent is the Soviet government currently expanding its territory, disregarding whether others oppose it? (2) How can a clear answer be obtained from Moscow? (3) Are there limits to the tolerance of Britain and the United States? (4) To what extent can the official policies of Britain and the United States cooperate in this regard? (5) If the deadlock on the Iranian issue cannot be broken when the Security Council convenes, will the Soviet Union withdraw from the UN mechanism? (6) If so, what will be the consequences?</p>
<p>Foreign Secretary Bevin has repeatedly stated that the British government will not change its policy until a proper solution is reached through international institutions. Most of the British people apparently share the same attitude.</p>
<p>The recent crisis between Britain and the Soviet Union is easily compared to the Munich Conference. The Soviet propaganda's attack on Iran, accusing Iran of intending to invade nearby Soviet territory, is indeed too similar to the Nazi propaganda at the beginning.</p>
<p>Practical theorists in London can be divided into two factions: one believes that the Soviet Union does not want to cause any more disputes, and the other believes that the Soviet Union believes that Britain or the United States will never use force again, and that it can take advantage of this opportunity. To sum up, it is still generally believed that an understanding with the Soviet Union can eventually be established sooner or later. (Reuters, London, March 17)</p>

<p>Suzhou: Coal Shortage, Request for Additional Allocation of Electricity. The Suzhou Electric Power Plant is short of coal. Ordered coal has not been delivered on time. Except for the lights, which are maintained with difficulty, it is still difficult to restore the use of electric motors, which has affected industrial production. In particular, most of the workers who depend on it for a living are requesting the factory to resume work as soon as possible. Now, more than ten guilds such as papermaking and rice milling have written to the County Chamber of Commerce for relief. The Chamber has already telegraphed the higher authorities on the 16th, requesting additional allocation of electricity fuel and designating it for the use of motors in various factories in order to quickly restore production.</p>
<p>The head of the warehouse of the 35th warehouse of the Suzhou Receiving Group of the Ministry of Military Administration, Yuan Zihua, colluded with staff members Chen Dingxuan, Wang Mengliu, etc., and stole and sold large quantities of materials from the warehouse, such as cement, iron pots, white sugar, asphalt, matches, and glass. Later, because the news leaked, they illegally tortured Gu Shiguan, a villager in Xikuatang Township. Because he was beaten, Gu was determined to take revenge, and he joined Yu Renyuan and witness Wang Rongmin (warehouse cook), etc., to report to the local military police. After the military police sent personnel to arrest and interrogate, they were confirmed to be true and were detained. A document was prepared to ask the superiors for verification. Later, the team received a letter from the receiving group of the Ministry of Military Administration, and the prisoner was brought back to handle the handover procedures. Unexpectedly, the prisoner took the opportunity to escape. The receiving group has now requested the superiors to issue a warrant for his arrest.</p>
<p>Changshu: Two Criminals of a River Robbery Case Arrested. The police detective team purchased a line to capture the thieves who robbed the Yangtze River vessel of the State-owned China Merchants Bureau outside Hupukou, Wang Shenghua, Shi Baosheng and other two key criminals who were selling more than 400 bags of flour. According to the confession, He Fuxing, Wang Ping, Wang Haihai, Li Baosheng, Chen Jindada, Chen Fusheng, Wang Jinsheng, and other seven criminals who bought the stolen goods were arrested in Xiyang and other places. After interrogation, it was found that He Fuxing and others had indeed mistakenly bought stolen goods. In addition to ordering them to pay the full value of the 400 bags of flour, they were released on bail. As for Wang Shenghua and Shi Baosheng, they were decided to be handed over for investigation.</p>
<p>Wuxi: Second Meeting of National Assembly Representatives. The National Assembly Suzhou Representatives Friendship Association convened its second meeting at the County Chamber of Commerce at 10 am on the 14th. Li Tieping and other ten people attended and discussed the following matters: (1) On the revision of the Five-Five Draft Constitution, it was unanimously advocated that the Three Principles of the People and the Five-Power Constitution should be the principles. Any revision that violates this principle will be corrected. (2) The representatives of this province are scattered in various places. On the political reforms in each place, it was decided to concentrate them at this meeting and send them to the provincial government or the central government for adoption. (3) The Communist troops in northern Jiangsu are wantonly harassing the area. How should we save them? It was decided to forward the request to the central government to immediately transfer the Communist troops in northern Jiangsu. (4) There are more than one million refugees in this province. How should we provide relief? It was decided to: 1. Telegraph the Executive Yuan, ordering the General Relief Administration to quickly send a large amount of materials for relief. 2. Write to the Su-Ning Branch, publicizing the distribution of received materials to local newspapers at any time. 3. Suggest that the provincial party and government jointly form a Suzhou Refugee Relief Committee. (5) Prepare to set up a democratic publication and a Shanghai edition of the daily newspaper. The rest are omitted.</p>
<p>Taixing: Calling for Adjustment of Councilors' Candidates. The list of interim councilors in this county was previously announced by the provincial government. It is learned that since reading the list, the people of the county have been discussing it. The County Chamber of Commerce was originally a legal national organization, and there is no lack of talent. The election of the councilors this time did not get a seat, which is obviously controlled by a few people. It is a pity. Yesterday, several representatives of various industry associations went to the county party and government agencies to petition, calling for them to comply with the situation and quickly forward the report to find a way to adjust it in order to comfort the public.</p>
<p>Guangming: Fundraising to Improve the Lives of Prisoners. The Prison Coordination Committee, which was established by the county's judicial office, previously decided to raise funds for improving the lives of prisoners and adding a few necessary houses.

<h3 id="e85">How to Stabilize Production <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Lu</p>
<p>Labor issues are quite serious in the industrial world. In some industries, because the sales of products are divided into peak months and off-peak months, production is very uneven. Because production cannot be averaged, more labor is needed in peak months and less labor is needed in off-peak months. In order to understand the needs of secondary production, during the peak months, it is not hesitate to use higher treatment to dig up labor from the same industry. Factory A digs up labor from Factory B, and Factory B digs up labor from Factory A, so that workers cannot work with peace of mind. At the same time, workers often make requests for increased treatment during peak months. This situation is very unfavorable in the process of production.</p>
<p>General factories also want to have a prescribed production volume all year round, based on the production volume in peak months, storing goods produced in off-peak months or finding ways to increase sales. However, during the adjustment period, there is really no power to support all the purchases of raw materials and the expenses such as labor wages. If you borrow from ordinary banks, you cannot afford the huge interest.</p>
<p>According to the author's opinion, the best way is for the national bank to implement low-interest loans and low-interest mortgages to the industrial sector, or to universally promote acceptance drafts, so that factories can calmly manage the annual production volume. Because the production volume can be fixed, there can be a comprehensive budget, and the treatment of workers can also be fixed or gradually improved with the living situation, so that they can live and work in peace and contentment, and there is no need for factories in the same industry to dig up labor.</p>
<p>Because there are many types of factories, it seems that we can start with industry associations at the beginning and make adjustments. Research and then implement, I don't know what the wise people of society think.</p>
<h3 id="e86">The Self-Education of American Workers <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>— Qinghe</p>
<p>None of us can deny that the general public's knowledge level in our country is indeed too shallow, which is why progress is so slow.</p>
<p>The way American workers not only organize themselves but also educate themselves can serve as a valuable reference for our country.</p>
<p>The oldest workers' education institution in the United States is the "Workers Education Bureau," established in 1921. It has branches throughout the United States. Their work includes printing books and pamphlets and publishing workers' education news. District representatives are stationed in various parts of the United States, and their primary work is to establish discussion classes. Each discussion session lasts from one to five days. The number of participants varies. Sometimes there are twenty to thirty people for in-depth study, and sometimes more than six hundred people participate. In June 1940, the tenth research class and the New Jersey Labor Association held a meeting at Rutgers University, with three hundred participants attending for five days to discuss the topic "Labor and the World Crisis."</p>
<p>The second national workers' education institution is the "American Labor Education Service," which regularly provides research materials to various parts of the country and answers inquiries about trade unions, workers' education committees, labor universities, libraries, etc. It also publishes pamphlets and bibliographies, assists trade union education departments in planning courses and hiring teachers.</p>
<p>The education department of an International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union was established in 1916. By 1936, education departments had been established in fifty-eight cities across the country, with 22,000 people participating in classes or group studies. The courses included English, parliamentary procedure, public speaking, current events, the history of the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union, economics, labor issues, etc.</p>
<p>The government also pays close attention to workers' education. In 1933, the government's Workers' Design Bureau specifically established a workers' service program to promote workers' education, and special supervisors were appointed in thirty-five states to encourage and organize workers' education.</p>
<h3 id="e87">Increasing Profits <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>— Li</p>
<p>Efficiency expert Mr. Carson once said that to increase the net profit of a business organization, the first thing to do is to increase sales. If sales can be increased by 20%, then profits can also be increased.</p>
<p>He said that, for example, a streetcar needs to carry sixteen passengers on a trip to cover its costs. If it only carries fifteen people, it will lose money; if it carries nineteen or twenty people, it can make a profit.</p>
<p>Therefore, his argument is that even a small increase in sales can lead to profits. Expanding sales, even by a very small amount, can have a significant impact.</p>
<h3 id="e88">The Omnipotent Doctor of Engineering <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>— Jiaxi</p>
<p>In the research department of General Motors in the United States, there is a Mr. Kettering, who is sixty-nine years old. Working in the research department of General Motors for fifty years is not a big deal; it is only a good starting point. The endless future is very small.</p>
<p>But Mr. Kettering has made great contributions to General Motors. He invented the automatic starter, which made American vehicles take a step forward; the ethyl gasoline he invented helped the Second World War to win; his diesel locomotive brought new developments to the railway; he also invented the artificial heater, which made it easier for doctors to diagnose syphilis and other serious diseases.</p>
<p>These great achievements, in Kettering's own view, are not surprising, because he has a philosophy of life: "When you think you are satisfied, you will not progress." His eternally dissatisfied spirit makes him eternally young. He is educating himself to become a doctor of engineering, which is a new profession in the scientific community. He hopes to study methods of treating pain. His aspiration was sympathized with by Mr. Sloan of General Motors last year, who donated four million yuan as a fund, which has been established in New York.</p>
<p>Mr. Kettering tells others that the only way to obtain facts is to use the method of experimentation. He also does experimental work at home anytime and anywhere. His wife drags him out to see a movie. By the time he returns from the movie theater, the program list is already covered with various symbols. He once used his wife's egg beater to test the coils of a radio. Experiments are everywhere.</p>
<p>Li has the following truths that are worth remembering:</p>
<p>"Research work is 10% experimentation and 90% getting along with colleagues harmoniously."</p>
<p>"All research work is 99.9% failure, and only one success is needed to achieve great success."</p>
<p>"If you want your experiment not to fail, you must continue to work hard until the last experiment before the experiment succeeds."</p>
<p>China's industrial circles really need talents like Mr. Kettering.</p>
<h3 id="e89">Introduction to Business Administration <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Baiyi</p>
<p>(1) Balanced Management</p>
<p>Business administration seems to be a relatively new term in China. In fact, its inception and development have only been in the last fifty years. Because industry is becoming increasingly developed, it can no longer lack organization and systematic management methods, and must utilize scientific, orderly, and systematic management methods. Therefore, business administration can also be called scientific management.</p>
<p>The biggest principle of business administration is to achieve the highest possible efficiency with the minimum amount of capital and labor. Therefore, business administration can be effective after it is implemented in a smooth organization; in a business that is in dire need of salvation, it can have significant effects once adopted. There are many business administration experts abroad whose job is to study the shortcomings of an organization. After finding the shortcomings, they use the principles of business administration to reform and adjust them, or implement various new programs, so that a dying business can embark on the road to revival.</p>
<p>According to the opinion of general experts, it is much easier to create a new organization than to reorganize an existing business. Because creating a new paper weaving can be done step by step, completely planned, and step by step, in an orderly manner, without constraints; in an existing organization, there are often many accumulated habits that are not easy to reform at once. However, in terms of interest, being able to save a dying business and repeat a vigorous phenomenon is more interesting and can better show the expertise of an expert.</p>
<p>However, it is passive work to rescue a business that has reached a dangerous situation. The active work should be to implement various new management programs at the beginning of the establishment, or when it feels that the progress is not very smooth, which can save a lot of time, manpower, and monetary losses.</p>
<p>Usually, when talking about business administration, it refers to an entire work. Because business administration must take into account all departments of an organization. In the past, in many organizations, because a certain part developed very rapidly, the other parts could not keep pace, which would create a disconnection phenomenon. For example, if the sales part of a factory is making rapid progress, but the production part cannot always have sufficient production to meet the needs, the result will inevitably disappoint customers, or switch to buying products from other factories. Conversely, if the production volume of a factory is quite large, but the sales part cannot fulfill its responsibilities, then the resulting goods cannot be sold, and the capital cannot be circulated.</p>
<p>The most important thing in business administration is the average development of each part. Each part must have appropriate management talents, and the management talents of each part must take close cooperation so that the business can develop rapidly. At the same time, the leaders of Bogo must have management knowledge and specialized knowledge of various parts.</p>
<p>There are many business organization leaders who are promoted from accounting directors. What they know cannot go beyond the scope of accounting. Therefore, they are not familiar with the production aspect or the sales aspect. Because they are not familiar, they cannot make appropriate arrangements. Even if there are shortcomings, they cannot be rescued or improved.</p>
<p>Or he is a person who has been promoted from the sales director to the leader. What he knows only belongs to the business aspect, so he cannot understand the actual situation of the production part or the accounting part.</p>
<p>There are also many leaders who have no knowledge of the various parts of business administration at all. Therefore, when he handles affairs, he relies entirely on his ideals or past experiences, knowing what is but not why. If he handles it successfully, he does not know because of which points it is successful; if he fails, he does not know because of which points it is failed. This is indeed a great loss for the individual of the leader. It is also very dangerous to entrust a business to such a leader.</p>
<p>Regarding the application of business administration principles, general business administration experts believe that applying the principles can save time, avoid mistakes, and unnecessary losses, and at the same time, it can make affairs simple and proceed smoothly.</p>
<p>After the Second World War, the United States was eager to help several backward countries embark on the road to industrialization. They were prepared to send experts to assist in everything. They called these experts people who know how to do it (Know How). This knowing how to do it is knowing how to apply the principles and putting the principles into practice.</p>
<p>In terms of the application of principles, a leader must not only understand the principles of business administration himself, but also must make his colleagues understand the principles of business administration, and must also make full use of their knowledge of business administration, and unite them to become a powerful driving force for a business.</p>
<p>In order to adapt to the environment and cope with abundance, modern industry and commerce must implement balanced management. The so-called balanced management is Balanced Management to make the three most important parts - Production, Sales, and Financing - have close ties.</p>
<p>These three parts must not only have close ties, but also have average development. Whether it is work, personnel, or even expenditures, they must be distributed very evenly after the entire planning.</p>
<p>If we study several successful organizations, we can definitely find that their three main parts are developing in an average and connected state.</p>
