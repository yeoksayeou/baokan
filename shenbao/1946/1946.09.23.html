<p>〔本報南京廿二日電〕未來局勢有無進展，今日已可獲大部結論，因共產黨今日向馬特使提出第二次備忘錄，堅持召開軍事三人會議，強論戰事形勢嚴重，已表明態度堅決。兩日前馬特使曾有一調處意見交王炳南，內容係以召開非正式五人小組會議，商談改組國府委會，俟獲有成就，再談停戰，此意見常由王炳南請示周恩來，今日接獲周氏指示，乃向馬特使作一答覆，亦即拒絕出席五人會議之意。馬特使接見王炳南時，曾向王提出若干意見，並稱：被將徵求政府代表意見。又王炳南今日之談話中，曾提及共產黨有公布全部談）話紀錄之要求，馬特使亦表示須與政府代表商談後再說。今日下午記者曾訪詢王炳南，王稱：此乃共產黨方面最後一次要求，局勢已屆最嚴重關頭。記者曾詢如政府方面亦復如共產黨堅決之態度，堅特召開五人會議，則局勢將不堪想像，共產黨方面是否有次一步之措置，王答以須待周恩來表示，因今日馬時使口頭所提意見，王已轉滬也。</p>

<p>〔本報南京廿二日電〕商談擱淺期中，屢有政府提議召開政協綜合小組會傳說，民盟秘書長梁漱溟昨對本報記者談話時，亦認政府方面吳鼎昌·雷震諸氏曾向張君勱有此表示，但綜合各方觀察，咸認目前決無召開綜合小組可能。廿二日晨記者特走訪吳文官長　昌，請解釋此事，據吳稱：本人係九日赴滬，十日上午於歡送張兼主席羣之機塲上，與吳鐵城·張君勱諸氏相値，於張羣氏起飛後，即偕張君勱同至吳鐵城寓所小坐，泛談時局，並表示盼五人小組會議即能召開，從未提及綜合小組之事，旋張氏於十五日答訪，因有他客未晤，十六日本人回訪，所談仍如上述，至邀其來京，不過私人意見，並非代表政府吳對中外傳種種，極表詫異。旋記者再訪雷副秘書長震，對赴滬任務，請加詮釋，雷稱：本人赴滬，並非專與民盟代表會晤，尙有其他公務，至於張君勱氏所談，絕未涉及綜合小組一事，並吿記者，彼廿三日擬訪梁潄溟，有所談詢。</p>

<p>英太平洋艦隊總司令包毅德爵士，日前乘巡洋艦貝爾法斯特號抵達下關江面，向我政府作官式的訪間，旋即在其旂艦舉行鷄尾酒會，招待我政府長官，一時賓主盡歡。次日，我國防部長白崇禧答宴，並聞在爵士留京期內，我海軍及政府當局將與之討論我新海軍建立問題。這無疑的是中英友好關係之一種親睦表示。願乘此機會，對我國新海軍之建立及在此方面之中英合作，略抒所見。</p>
<p>無海軍即無國防，此爲我在此次大戰中所受的慘痛經騐。因此，今後我國國防的建設，自不可忽略海軍在國防巾所應有之地位。我國之訓練及經營海軍的建立，原已有了六七十年的歷史，在甲午戰前，且曾稱雄東亞，其後以濟政窳敗，人謀不臧，抱殘守缺到如今。經過此次慘痛的經騐，我們纔踏上重建海軍的新路。國防部的成立，糾正了過去海陸兩軍自成系統的惡習，這纔使中國海軍有了新機運。新任海軍副總司令桂永淸中將，雖出身陸軍然以桂氏對國際情勢之熟悉，必能在陳兼總司令督導之下，將我國新海軍建立起來。</p>
<p>明瞭作戰及近代戰爭的人，即使在利用原子能的時代，不會否認海軍在國防上的效用，海軍不因原子能的利用而淘汰，反因原子能的利用而增加其效用，擊敗日德的主要軍力，還是靠海軍的力量。因爲我國海軍的落後，而我國的海岸綫有這麼綿長，所以在我們國防的建設上，也特別應該注重海軍的建設。在我們新海軍的建設上，我們尤其需要中英的合作。誰都知道英國是近代海軍的先進國，中國最初致力於海軍的建設，當時曾得到英國的協助。如今我們重建海軍，我們還得需要我們的老友協助。這在我們，誠然是萬分慚愧的。</p>
<p>英國雖有老大帝國之號，但在近代戰爭上，英國的貢獻特多。第一次大戰中，由於英人有坦克車的發明，擊敗了德國，使近代戰爭從壕溝陣地回復到流動戰，完全改變了近代戰爭的型式。在第二次世界大戰中，由於英人最初有雷達的使用，致使戈林的空軍打得落花流水。此外，若英人有盤尼西林的發明，雖不與戰爭直接有關，然在此次戰爭中亦是一種極重要的勝利因素。「周雖舊邦，其命維新。」古老的英國，當之可以無愧。講到海軍，英國若干海軍設備或不如人，但英國海軍有其光榮的傳統，優良的訓練，凡此，均是我新生海軍所應取法借鏡的。包毅德爵士此次來華，深信必能加强中英的合作，特別是中英海軍方面的合作。</p>
<h3 id="c44">美軍退出中國的宣傳 <a href="#c44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>美國若十人民團體，例如紐約爭取和平委員會與民主遠東政策委員會等。聯名發起「美軍退出中國週」。全國主要城市三十五處，均已於昨日開始舉行這一個宣傳運動，至廿八日爲止，這種運動，在民主自由的美國，司察見慣，本不足過分重視；但是這一個運動牽涉到中國的政治，尤其是我們不願在中美兩國人民之間還有誤會與隔閡的存在，不得不再爲這一小部份的美國友人進一言。</p>
<p>中國目前的局勢，確宣非常危急。中國爲反侵略的急先鋒，苦撑了八年，好容易獲得勝利。詎知中國共產黨，乘大戰之後，秩序尙未恢復，稱兵作亂。擴充地　，圖以武力奪取政權，使中國仍陷於戰亂的困境。美國政府當局，爲完成結束戰事締造和平的任務，決定將美軍暫留中國，協助中國遣送敵僑敵俘返國，並促成中國的和平統一，一年以來，美國政府本此方針，推行其對華政策，迄無變更，最近雖有一小部份的美國人士。一方面看到中國國內戰亂的日益擴大，另一方面又受了中共宣傳攻勢的欺騙，紛紛向美國軍政當局，要求美軍退出中國，但是美國負責當局。依然堅定如故。例如美國第七艦隊司令柯克上將於本月九日在北平凡稱，美國海軍陸戰隊之留駐中國，其唯一的任務，厥在協助中國遣送敵僑敵俘返國以及樹立中國國內的和平秩序。一俟此項任務完成，即可自中國撤退回國，同時，美國務院聯絡司司長羅塞爾，於本月十五日答覆美國和平委員會稱：「美國政府已決定：一俟中國和平恢復，强大的統一的民主的中國實現之後，美國軍隊即當全部自由國撤退。杜魯門總統於去年十二月間發表對華政策，聲明美國對華採取不干涉政策，此項政策，迄無變更。」美國政府的態度，光明磊落，實無可以懷疑之處。</p>
<p>美國輿論界，對於中國問題的看法，顯然可以分爲兩派：一派認爲美國對於世界和平，負有重大責任，對於遠東和平的締造，更是責無旁貸，尤其對於中國，應履行其在戰時所提供的諾言。「密勒氏評論報」發行人鮑威爾所領導的美國對華政策協會，可認爲是這一派的代表。該會曾於本月八日上杜魯門總統函，要求美國政府應立即堅持蘇聯放棄其在政治上對於中國所有領土之控制，內稱〔中國共產黨受莫斯科控制，並無意與蔣主席成立協議。但僅欲利用和平商談，以遷延時日，俾得乘機鞏固其地盤，自蘇聯獲取軍備，在東北編練軍隊，其中有一部份，係屬日人，高麗人，以及僞軍，並設法離間美國對於　蔣主席之同情與援助。」此在另一派人士，則以爲中國戰亂的局勢已成，非人力所能挽回，美國爲本身利益計，應以不捲入漩渦爲宜，故要求美軍退出中國。該派可以參議員愛蘭德及布特萊等爲代表，曾迭次發表要求美軍退出中國的言論。波士頓郵報也加以評論稱：「美軍在日軍逐出中國之後，實不應再留駐中國。蓋此舉不但使吾人負担龐大費用，而且有捲入中國內亂的遊渦之虞。」這一派的言論主張，與美國參戰前的孤立派無異，並不能獲得大多數人民的擁護。</p>
<p>美國人民對於美軍留駐中國，雖有兩種不同的見解，但是他們渴望中國早日獲致和平，則完全相同。因此，我們要問：中國戰亂不已的根本原因，是否在美軍的留駐中國？美軍一旦撤退之後，中國的戰亂能否立即可以停止？如果是正面的答覆，則我們也贊成並將要求美軍立即退出中國。但是按之實際，此時美軍留駐中國，猶負有其協助中國遣送敵僑敵俘以及恢復和平秋序的任務，爲中國和平計，同時也爲世界和平計，美國應貫澈其旣定的對華政策。但是在美國爲什麽會有一小部份的人士，不明遠東眞相，主張美軍應退出中國呢？這不能不說是中共反美運動所造成的結果。因爲美國現行對華一政策，承認國民政府爲唯一合法的政府，並希望中國能成爲强大的統一的民主的國家，中共乃不惜千方百計以破壞之，甚至造成意外事件，企圖嚇退美國。在一般明瞭中國眞相的人，對於中共所玩弄的這一套手法，固然看得非常淸楚，但是終不免有一小部份，懾於中共的威脅，遂襲過去孤立派的作風，採取消極態度，而主張美軍退出中國，殊不知此實中了中共之計。</p>
<p>要之，我們以爲中國確實需要和平，並盼望美國協助中國獲致和平，至少要使中共所製造的戰亂在中國不再擴大。對於主張美軍退出中國的美國友人，因其用意亦在希望中國和平，故不論其主張如何，我們仍負有使他們眞正了解中國政情的義務。否則他們的錯誤行動，適足以更增強中共反美的宣傳攻勢，不特無利於中國和平，抑且對於美國也是有害無益的。</p>

<p>〔聯合社紐約廿一日電〕英前首相邱吉爾最近在沮利希演說，主張組織「歐洲合衆國」後，蘇聯方面振振有詞，謂邱氏正在進行西方集團運動，以便與蘇聯對抗。邱氏演說可與貝爾納斯在斯都伽特之演說先後呼應，目的在使德人振作，允許給予彼等西方民主陽光之一席地位。耶氏明白要求歐洲各小國與蘇聯脫輻，而依照渠所提法德合夥之計劃，自定方向，此種計劃即使對極端邱吉爾主義派、亦爲一種挑釁。試想波·匃·羅·與南斯拉夫能吾脫離蘇聯勢力範圍，而協助法·德·弗朗哥的西班牙及其他國家在蘇疆附近組成可能爲世界最强大之國家？言念及此，即覺光景黯淡。「歐洲合衆國」爲若干世界最優秀理想家之目標，尤以首次大戰後爲然。法故總理白禮安乃主要提議人之一，而曾爲國聯所接受者，預定組成一自治聯邦，由聯邦議會綜其事，解決一部份邦內關係問題，並設聯合軍隊，以資防禦，一如美聯邦政府初期計劃然。後雖有人主張，統一的歐洲應自烏拉爾山脈起，至大西洋爲止；但一般相信：當以波羅的海以西崎嶇區域，至多瑙河口爲範圍。第一步當在樹立各邦間之自由貿易。蘇聯之國家壟斷對外貿易制度，自不適用於新聯邦；但今日之歐洲已非二次世界大戰以前可比，蘇聯與西方各國鴻溝顯然，即邱吉爾所謂鐵幕是也，故聯邦制度終難實現耳。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦廿一日電〕關於組織歐洲合衆國之具體計劃，歐洲問題國際硏究會頃發表宣言，署名者有英國貝佛里治勛爵。佛勤明爵士。曁法國赫里歐·居里等。文內稱：「聯合國旣不能單獨阻止另一戰爭發生，在其現行方式之下，亦不能弭戰，安理會無能爲力。按諸經騐，則唯有另創一新世界。目前世界必須承認：組織一世界聯邦殆不可能，即欲成立若干集團，以待日後統一亦不可能。邱吉爾旣已倡議歐洲合衆國，吾人自應提出若干具體辦法，俾消滅締造和平途中所有一切障礙。同時又一主張在各國議會中成立一國際關係委員會，相互諮詢，日後再組成一共有之國際議會，蘇聯亦得隨時參加。惟在德國，則必須證明其有和平意向之後，始可加入。因此凡在聯合國控制下之區域，如特里埃斯特區，以及魯爾區等，均可獲得良好發展矣。</p>

<p>〔本報東京特派員廿一日電〕盟國對日基本政策大多由華盛頓十一國組成的遠東委會決定，交麥帥總部執行。此外在日本還有一個近於諸詢性質的盟國對日管制委員會，係由中·美·英·蘇。四國代表組成。本年四月以來，該會曾就日本擴充漁區問題，農地改革問題有所討論。最近兩星期來的中心議題，是日本</p>
<p>煤礦國有</p>
<p>問題，我國代表朱世明將軍在前次（四日）會議中，主張煤礦應歸國有，並願將中國高級焦煤與日本低級煤斤交換。在十八日開會時，朱代表再提出該案，並謂我國對麥帥總部復興日本經濟的計劃，願予以主持。我方提出此案，對日本經濟復興的影響甚大，自不待言。因煤是各種工業的基礎，爲各種動力所必需，但日本所出煤質極劣，且含灰份極多，疎鬆易碎，不宜於冶金工業。戰前日本冶金工業所需之煤，多由我國東北，華北，及越南輸入，最近日本煤礦出產的情形，可說是一蹶不振。據讀賣新聞稱：一九四一年每月平均出煤四百六十萬噸，該年所僱礦工爲卅三萬四千人。本年迄七月十五日止，礦工的人數雖未减少，而每月出炭量則逐漸减少。一九四一年每人每月平均出炭量爲一三·五噸，本年四月爲五·三噸，六七月間則僅爲五噸。現在日本工業所需之煤，最低量爲每月二百萬噸。煤礦生產不振的原因在</p>
<p>資材不足</p>
<p>此外糧食缺乏自然是一種主要的　　，因爲礦坑的工作，本　於一種重量勞動，其次的原因是煤價過低，現行煤價係採二重制，有生產者擭格及消費者擭格　種，生產者　　係由政府貼補，以　成本，可是政府的貼補　追不上物價的上漲，以致無從刺激生產的增加，現在政府的貼補額爲每噸二百六十元，而生產成本則需三百六十八元。資材方面如鋼條，硝，鐵，白金，水泥，纖維用品，油類等，都感缺乏。最根本的原因是礦山荒廢的問題，舊有礦山因戰時採掘過多，埋藏炭量多已採掘殆盡，一切設備亦多有損壞。例如常磐炭礦，出煤一噸，須排水八十噸，如不着手開發新礦，日本煤斤生產的增加自有限度。我國代表的提案對日本工業關係甚大。自在對日管制委員會中提出煤礦國有問題後，政府及</p>
<p>業主反響</p>
<p>並不甚佳，星島商相九日於衆議院物資供應調整法案委會中聲稱：今日的情形，首在增加生產，但實行國有，却是阻礙生產，故不擾予以考激，而各礦業主爲了本身利益，自不贊成炭礦國有。業主主張（一）糧食的配給應予以保證。（二）廢止貼補制，以生產費爲標準，決定販賣價格。（三）應優先配給各種資材。各政黨對此問題亦甚注意，自由，進步，社會三黨主張成立三黨硏究煤礦應否國營審議會。社會黨不主張立即實行國營，而實行社會化的國家管理。自由進步兩黨的主張則爲：（一）廢除貼補制度，木材及機械類配給實物。（二）恢復一九四三年的煤斤配給辦法，即由日本煤業公司將各礦之煤一一收買下，再賣與各業主，由業主根據政府配給計劃，自行販賣，以提高各業主的生產意識，及加强其責任觀念。（三）對於製鐵·電氣·煤氣·鐵道·肥料等工業，與以貼補。關於煤礦</p>
<p>經營方式</p>
<p>的意見，眞可說是層出不窮，最後的決定將待之於　帥　　，可是據記者個人的意見，經營方式的變更，不一定可以促進生產的增加，應該從目前日本盡個經濟情勢去把握這個問題。目前的日本經濟情形，可說是尙未達到恢復健康的狀態，戰後的惡性通貨膨脹，及物價體系的混亂，而且各種資材因戰時使用過度，多已腐朽不堪，在在均足以使各業生產停滯不前，從煤之生產而言，日本工業如無國外資材輸入，甚難恢復健康狀態。據日本經濟學者西村義太郞說：現有資本設備均已老朽不堪且均屬舊式，戰時不僅未加修補，且多强加使用，不要說擴充生產，即維持現有生產亦甚困難。所以目前最大的問題是資材補充問題，煤斤生產在目前這種生產條件之下，即使實行國營，也不過是官僚式的國營，於實際無所裨益。在一個資本設備均已腐朽的廣墟上，又怎能使他甦生呢？</p>

<p>蘇浙皖區接收處理敵僞物資工作淸査團滬杭組，工作結束在即，特於昨日上午十時，假中國銀行二樓二一八室舉行茶會，招待各界，報吿該團辦理淸査工作之意義及其經過，到團長張知本，委員程中行，范爭波，及市參議會推派之代表趙君豪，馬君碩，何元明，王劍鍔四議員，參議會正副議長潘公展，徐寄廎，市商會常務理事金潤庠，中國工業協會理事長吳蘊初，及各報社新聞記者等六十餘人，首由張團長報吿稱：「此次由中央監察委員會國民參政會監察院合組淸査團，以極少數的人力，最短的期限，責成我們明瞭接收工作的眞相，果何恃而不恐呢？就是大家都相信，各當地民意機關，民衆團體，新聞記者必能以其一年來所見所聞及其感想，盡量的吿訴我們，那麽無形中已不啻由少數人增加至兩百萬人，由短時間增加至一年以上，即如木團到滬以來，承各界推誠相與，充分表示合作精神，使本團工作加强，已是收效大騐，另一方面，關於敵僞物資之接收處理不當，以及接收人員之舞弊等，原應由正常機關予以糾正或制裁，例如接收物資之　匿侵佔，係屬刑事範圍，產權之糾紛，係屬民事範圍，行政處分之不當或違法，則應依照行政訴願法及行政訴訟法之程序辦理。其他如接收人員之貪汚舞弊等，亦有監察機關可以檢舉，本團係一臨時機構，工作僅限於淸查，淸査完畢，一切均應交由有權管轄機關依法處理。國家不幸而有臨時機構，原屬不得已之舉，深望正常機關皆能依據國法，充分行使其職權，循常軌而崇法治，才是國家之福</p>
<p>不侮鰥寡不畏強禦　公平正直進行工作</p>
<p>本團自到滬開始辦公迄今，計收文五二五件，其中關於密吿案件計三五五件，經就其性質分類合併爲二九三案，截至本月二十日止，經本團辦結者二〇八案，向各機關查詢未復，及尙在調査中者八五案，此外上海各接收機關已經送到報吿書者計八五單位，其餘尙有四單位，已函其上級機關飭令補送中，本團工作人員除委員外，關於公文之收發撰擬繕校等僅有九人，且限於規定，均係向各機關調用，時値　暑，仍須整日辦公，其勤勞至爲可念。</p>
<p>本團同人抱定：「不侮鰥寡，不畏强禦」之精神，從事公平正直的淸査工作，無論是民衆的密吿檢舉，或是各機關送來的案件，本團必須要明瞭事實的眞相，求得證據的確鑿，如果證據確鑿，便立即予以摘發，惟不肯憑空武斷，犧牲他人之信譽，以邀「風厲」之名，蓋「淸査」之對象，爲淸査接收處理之工作，對事多而對人少，故與「査辦」不同，惟因事而影響於人者，則無論其爲何如人，皆應付諸法律之裁制，本團同人方面「其難其愼」，一方面「任勞任怨」，這是所敢自信的，光哲有言：「刑罰不中，則民無所措手足」。又說：「是非不明，節義不講，天下所由亂也」。譬如公務員貪污，應由國法加以嚴厲的制裁，但是現在大多數公務員，都是過着清苦的生活，甚至有不能維持生活者，而社會上一般輿論，對於公務員籠統的認爲貪汚，致使一般奉公守法的公務員皆思潔身引退，而少數眞正貪汚之徒，反而逍遙法外，暢所欲爲了。又如抗戰時期，在倫陷區內的同胞，可以說大多數都是具有愛國的熱忱，因爲裏面有少數不肖份十有奸僞行爲，一般輿論遂認爲淪陷區內的人都有奸僞行爲，致使大多數被敵僞綁票受盡痛苦的同胞蒙受不白之寃，而眞正爲虎作倀之徒，反而可以銷聲匿跡，掩其罪行了。所以我們覺得明辨是非，是大家所應該注意的。</p>
<p>三點感想</p>
<p>本團在滬期間，博採衆論，默察輿情，歸納起來、所得的如下述：（一）政府於接收處理之政策，似有失當，常抗戰朋中，工商業被摧毀殆盡，人民皆顚沛窮困，政府接收敵僞之物資，自應儘量利用，來扶持工商業復興和拯救人民之痛苦，似不宜以此項接收物資，冀爲平衡政府財政收支之需。（二）接收機構，組織散漫，滬上接收機構竟達八十九單位之多，各自爲政，缺乏聯繫，職責不明，相互爭執，此對彼揭，甚至封條重重，致形成騷擾凌亂之象。（三）接收處理工作，過於遲緩，接收機構旣屬散漫，處理工作自亦因之遲緩，接收封存之工廠倉庫，因處理之遲延，內部物資，或隱匿盜賣，或因時間過久，腐臭霉爛，甚且尙有未及接收者，致令有用之物資未能充分予以利用，工廠停閉，生產衰落，物價因之騰貴，人民生活並不堪其苦，這幾點意見，可以說是忠直之言，接收工作之未能盡滿人意，這是無可諱言的，我們自應轉達於行政當局，行政當局也必定能受盡言樂於接受而予以斟酌改進的。至於外間一般傳說，對於政府由重慶派來上海接收人員，加以種種徽號，例如什麽：「天上飛下來的」，「地下鑽出來的」，「重慶而孔」等等，本團同人聽見，這種傳說，固視爲「言者無罪」「聞者足戒」之列，但是這種過近惡意的流言，在道德上，在法律上，都是說不過去的。語云：「流丸止於甌臾，流言止於智者」，市井不乏流言，殊望其止於智者。</p>
<p>感謝協助</p>
<p>據敵僞產業處理局報吿，上海一地接收敵僞物資總値的在萬億以上，而杭州僅百億以上，其比例相差甚鉅，以本團少數之人力，短促之時間，自難期其澈底的淸査，幸在滬月餘，承各界隨時予以鼔勵，或予以督促，並且各業同業公會還提供我們許多誠摯的意見，這是本團深表感謝的，尤其最近上海市參議會推派代表五位參加工作，足以表現民意機關與本團之熱誠合作，而使淸查工作更能獲得迅速妥善之效果。</p>
<p>本團定於本月底結束，所有收受密吿曁接收機關報吿，以及經辦各案件，正在整理分類彙列表册之中，將來當可公諸社會，以待各界之指正。</p>
<p>程監察使　繼起致詞</p>
<p>繼續監察使中行發表其感想謂：我政府推行五權制度，已有二十年，此五權制度，尤其是司法與監察兩機關，向保持充分獨立精神，不受任何方面之牽制千涉，此次組織淸査團，終因其爲臨時性之機構，在在有被勢力及人情包圍之可能，惟雖如此，本團仍當保持固有之獨立精神，不畏强暴，不恂私情，及其他種種牽制，使每一淸査案件，均能獲得結果，希望社會人士及輿論界協助我們完成任務</p>
<p>程氏答覆　潘再聲明</p>
<p>末由程中行對潘議長所提各點加以答覆：（一）淸査團係一臨時機構，對外並未規定發言人，同時因爲新聞界同人來團探訪消息者，極爲踴躍，故充分表現自由空氣，且有若干密吿案件，係原密吿人直接招待記者發表。（二）對於工作不在造成「風厲」一點，本人認爲木團的工作實在不够「風厲」，到今天爲止，能辦了多少重要案件？關於孫田昌植案，本團已送法院，至該院如何偵査，不是我們的責任，此外本人謂爲「對事不對人」一點，朱必全對，因爲「事」一定是「人」辦的，要追究事的責任，當然要連帶的懲罰辦事的人。</p>
<p>潘議長於程氏答覆後，提出聲明兩點：（一）本人原意絕非限制新聞記者採訪新聞，（二）對孫田昌植案，本人並未提及，惟現在本人却願對該案略述惑想，本人以爲孫田昌植個人固應負法律上之責任，接收處理機關對其倉庫忽而査封，忽而發還，其責任允當追究。」潘程二氏雖小有辯論，然均希望淸査工作獲得圓滿結果，語重心長，全體一致報以熱烈掌聲。最後本市記者紛紛起立，發表意見，直至十二時許始散。</p>
<p>明辨案件是非　審查母縱母枉　參議會議長潘公展致詞</p>
<p>嗣請參議會議長潘公展致詞：渠首對淸査團在人力財力如此拮据之下工作如此認眞，表示欽佩。盼能保持以往精神，完成使命。對參議會參加淸查工作之五代表，並望本人民代表的立塲，謹愼細密，保持獨立精神，協助淸査工作。潘氏繼稱：「才張團長說，有了淸査團的臨時組織，是國家的不幸，本人頗有同感。因爲正常的監督機關，假使對接收處理工作，都能盡糾正監督之責，就不需要組織淸査團，因此本人認爲淸查團的期限愈長，就表示國家政治還沒有眞正走上軌道，對於淸査國過去的工作精神，本人惟有一點貢獻，即各委員對外發表談話時，意見不能集中，內容難免出入，本人以爲每一案件，旣採合議方式，似可由負責人對外發表，較爲妥善，此外本人認爲淸査團旣不是藉工作表現「風厲」，誠如張團長所謂，對於每一案件都辨明是非，審査確實，毋「縱」毋「枉」，才能免去「籠統」的弊病。最後還要補充一句話，就是淸査接收工作，重在主管接收機關及責負辦理接收工作的人，淸査團的工作，顧名思義，雖然對事不對人，但是因辦理接收工作而舞弊的人，常爲淸査的對象，如果所辦的不是接收工作的人，而是被接收的人，果爾，則每一次淸査，無異就增加人民一次痛苦，這種不合理的現象，當然應該由辦理淸査團移送案件的各主管機關來負責。潘氏詞畢，市商會常務理事金潤庠，繼對團長所稱：「接收物資應作扶助工商從事建設之用，不應用於平衡收支」一點，希望直接向最高領袖提出建議，俾能發生效力。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕國防部預算局局長趙志垚氏，昨午會同新任第一補給區司令富文中將，聯合假座北四川路底補給司令部俱樂部，招待本市新聞界。席間對過去軍政部京滬　特派員及第一補給區司令任內，所有經辦之軍品接收處理，以及補給情形，均有詳情報吿。趙氏首稱自去年九月九日奉命成立特派員辦事處後，因所轄地區除京滬綫外，尙包括揚州，杭州，嘉興，寗波，餘姚，慈谿，象山，安慶，蕪湖等地，故工作頗爲艱鉅煩重。</p>
<p>接收方式</p>
<p>至於接收方式由各受降主官分別規定：（一）南京區；敵偽倉庫及廠所場院由本處直接　接收。敵軍所保有之武器彈藥糧服及一切軍品，由新六軍接收，再交本處。接收卡車歸新六軍接收。乘車由陸軍總部接收。（二）鎭江區：（包括揚州）敵僞倉庫除五十七師所接受敵第三師團所保有者，係逕交第一補給區接管外，餘由本處直接接收。（三）上海區：除有一部份軍需工廠及僞經理總監部向僞棉統會定購布疋花紗，由本處直接接收外，其餘軍需倉庫及一切軍品均由前三方面軍軍品接收委員會接收後，再交本處接收。（四）京滬綫其他各處：統由前三方面軍軍品接收委會所屬混合接收組接收後，再交木處接收。（五）浙江區及蕪湖之一部份：由前三戰區設置接管組接收後，再陸續交本處接收。（六）安慶：由前第十戰區派駐該處部隊接收後，再交本處接收。接收單位共一百〇五處——包括軍需工廠塲听院站及倉庫，計南京三十四處，上海三十四處，杭州十一處，嘉定七處，蘇州七處，常州四處，嘉興八處，其他如鎭江，揚州，安慶，太倉，寗彼等地，僅接收一部份糧珠或一部份軍品。</p>
<p>處理方法</p>
<p>接收單位及軍品，除軍需工廠以不停止工作爲原則，分別性質由各主管署派員接辦外，其餘物資奉令作如下之處理：（一）報繳，凡接收物資屬於非軍品或雖係軍品而暫時不用者，一律報繳敵僞產業處理局，計報繳者有布疋三百〇五萬七千餘疋，棉紗八千三百餘件，棉花二萬七千三百餘擔，尙有一部份因軍中需要，曾於去年十一月間經敵僞產業審議會通過，留作軍用。估計由本處報繳處理局之物品，（包括一切日用品如汗衫，香烟，洋火，肥皂，鹽等）約値時價三千億元以上。（二）補給，凡屬補給品者，如糧秣，副食物以及被服，裝具，衛生藥品，通信器材，彈藥等，均交第一補給區司令部接管補給。（三）儲備，凡屬儲備品者，如槍砲器材，醫療品械，車輛，船隻，兵工，被服，原料等，均交各主管署分別接儲備用。</p>
<p>竊盜主因</p>
<p>趙富兩氏並承認接收倉庫中，確有舞弊盜竊情事發生，其主要原因爲無原始清冊，管理員遂乘機竊盜。其次爲接收時敵僞產業堆積如山，以接收人員缺少，致誤用匪人。惟現已糾正此情形。據二氏謂：上海發生是　竊盜情事者申二三起，蘇州）起，但被　之　　均已追圃。竊盜　　　中分別處罪，重者槍斃，輕者　　，在上海方面因竊盜倉庫而拘押者有數十人。趙氏並表示接收地區遼關，人員缺乏，發生弊端，自難諱言，但接收工作雖已吿一段落，如有問題發生，決不推諉，仍當負責。趙富二氏最後談及第一補給區之情况，按趙氏原任該區司令，於本年六月始調任國防部預算局長，遺缺乃由副司令富文升任，據稱：第一補給區之業務有全國性，南至廣東，北至東九省，補給均由上海轉出。而其最大困難爲（一）物資不充分，（二）預算限制，（三）籌辦運輸等各方配合不靈活，致各部隊所需補給，時常不能很快運到，對此現正力求改進中。又辦人員亦良莠不齊，有不負責任且有理弊端者，希各方隨時將聽到見到者，轉吿本部。如査得確有非法情事或不盡職者，決不袒護部下，定予嚴懲。</p>

<p>公教人員承購物品普無強制</p>
<p>市配處首决配售食盒盒，近以有少數發霉，外間致有微言。昨據該處處長殷體揚語記者稱：公敎人員實行配售物品，係仿照京市辦理，憑票配給制度，頗爲公允，倘不願某决配售物品，並不强制承購，每次配售品，均陳列本處門首玻璃櫉內，如認爲不甚實用，自可放棄，惟事實上配購人數，至爲踴躍，十日之中，已出售半數以上，且有欲購雙份一份以上者。至於其中容有因存放地位關係，日久發霉，本處爲避免調換之煩，即日起加緊開箱，逐一檢查，如有損壞，即不發出，希望領物之人，稍爲等待，因開箱檢査手續增加，發物速率必將稍減。其已領之發霉食盒，設有調換地方，希望由各機關彙總來換，以期便利。記者詢以天氣已寒，棉布何時可以配售，殷氏答稱，俟中信局撥到，即可配售。記者又詢南京將配給呢制服及燃料，本市如何，據稱已向經濟部請求，燃料委員會亦函本處調査人數，想京滬公敎人員待遇相同，京市所有，本市當不致見缺。此外救濟總署上海分署，不久或將指定物品，由本處配售，行政院物資供應局物品種類允多，本處自當按照合約規定，遂步推進配售業務，爲公敎人員服務，現開辦伊始，希望本市公敎人員，予以協助。</p>

<p>又據物品配售處，負責人稱：食盒內食品如發現有發霉者，可向木處倉庫掉換：（一）市政府修車廠倉庫，（二）跑馬廳倉庫，（三）百老匯倉庫，本處指派專員負責調換。</p>

<p>〔本報特寫〕上海的書畫展覽會一向是免費入塲，無需門票的，所以像寗波同鄕會等處的展覽會塲裏，常見看客們扶老携幼，闔第光臨，大家擠在唐伯虎祝枝山的作品前面，因爲他們在「三笑姻緣」彈詞裏聽到過這兩位的名字，看見了牆上掛着的仕女畫，有些人會批評「有點像陳雲裳」而上海有幾個畫家也當眞會把自己筆下的仕女努力畫得極像陳雲裳。展覽會的會塲裏吵得烟霧瘴氣並不是難得的事情，而滿地西瓜子殼更似乎大家覺得司空見慣。</p>
<p>然而，昨天的中國畫苑却不同。門票雖售二千一張，參觀的人仍舊相當擁擠。不過，閒閒磕着瓜子聊天的人倒是一個都沒有了。這次中國文物公司和中國文物硏究會所主辦的歷代書畫展覽會，作品在質量上都和平日畫賈主辦的展覽會大不相同。從他們的目錄上看，作品中自唐朝褚遂良到近人吳昌碩王一亭，一共二百另六件，全部是私家收藏，而這些藏家本身就有不少是可以有資格開作品展覽會的人，如龐虛齊，吳湖帆，劉海粟，吳子深等。展覽品的取舍似乎頗有斟酌，仕女中不見改七薌，山水中不見陸廉夫，前一陣在上海忽然頗出風頭的虛谷也祇有一件陳列。此外，有楊椒山而無趙松雪，也不像偶然。錢南園有畫而無字，更是深得我心了。</p>
<p>我常覺得評騭書畫，祇能各求會心。故「翰墨」之知，神髓還是在于「因緣」二字。我以爲好的就是好，我不能強你阿我所好，我更不願崇拜偶像，或把好好書畫視爲可以論斤計兩的商品。祇求使我心愛，不必求「眞」，更無需　「古」。</p>
<p>因之，我所最喜歡的幾件出品是：（一）惲南田的「魚藻圖」，看上去祇覺得淸麗絕俗，嬌艷無比，有宋詞的境界，　灑到了極點。（二）王右谷的「秋樹昏鴉圖」我以爲此圖成就之高，已達巔峯，筆筆迥護於有意無意之間，會見者爲之心曠神怡，全會塲四王之作，此圖允可壓卷。（三）項聖謨的「愚卉」，　的是一盆蒼蒲，上棲蝴蝶一頭，雖不設色，而看來却像是五彩繽紛似的，蝶翅上繁縟細緻的花紋和蒼蒲的質樸遒勁恰成一個相得益彰的對比，使我想起了中國的芳干建築物—很本的槪念常以質朴見長，而裝飾却往往不厭華聸。即如中國的瓷器，它的式樣決不如日本人那樣做得奇形怪狀，而瓷器上的釉彩之常　華貴，却就能叫全世界的藝術愛好者歎爲觀止。○李日華的「荷花」閒逸而圓潤，令人想起故弘一大師「華枝春滿，天心月圓」的境界。（五）邵彌的「右軍換扇圖」，此圖的一個啓示是「寫意」與「寫實」得到了合一，明明是「從心所欲」，然而這鵝的綫條是何等準確—這裘，簡直就有西洋畫素描的氣息，和西洋畫不同的，是：這裏有神韵，有風致，有畫家的人格。（六）仇十洲的「松陰高士圖」，沈石田的「桂花書屋圖」，看時祇覺可喜。（七）文徵明的「煮茶圖」，這張畫的木身倒還不見得怎麽樣，而蠅頭小楷的長題却使你流連忘返，揣摩不盡。（八）夏珪的「春山遊騎圖」，疏疏朗朗，格調極高。（九）這次展覽最古的一件出品是何尊師的「葵石戲貓岡」，絹色己黝，然而岡中幾只貓却眞是玉雪可珍，神彩奕奕，設色運筆，大有可觀！這張畫問世的時候，達文奇和米凱朗琪羅正還不知在什麽地方呢！</p>
<p>化兩千塊錢看一次書畫展覽會，在上海是要算空前之舉，不過，道一次展賣會的內容實在太整富了，看這樣一次展覽，無論如何此看一場「出水芙蓉」之類的電影要有意義得多！</p>

<p>〔本報訊」市參議員陳保泰周斐成等，向市參議會提議，請市府轉呈中央，在本市敵僞產業收入項下，撥發百分之十二，作爲本市敎育補助費，其理由如下：抗戰八載，各地文化敎育機關，多被摧毁，尤以滬市爲甚，中央對其他省市，業已撥發款項補助，（如南京市即已撥款十億元），惟本市迄未被澤及，本市人口衆多，求學者自亦不少，因復員之各校，多遭破壞。然又限於經費，無力修葺，故對莘莘學子，弗克盡量容納，致本季考生，多有失學向隅之感。茲擬請市府援照中央撥給各省市補助費案，呈請中央，在本市敵偽產業收入項下，對本市敎育機關酌撥經費補助，則取之於地方者，仍用之於地方矣，庶幾失學之青年幸甚，敎育幸甚，國家幸甚。（辦法）（一）擬請市府援照中央撥給各省市補助費案，呈請中央，在本市敵僞產業收入項下，撥發百分之十二，作爲本市敎育補助費。（二）南京人口的六十萬人，已蒙中央撥發敎育補助費十萬萬元，上海人口的四百萬人，擬請依比例，在敵偽產業收入項下撥發，在未撥發以前，由國家銀行先借發敎育補助費六十萬元，以濟眉急。聞市參議會今日將討論此案，事關補助敎育，當不致發生異議云。</p>

<p>（一）不勞而獲之收入，不算報酬，如房地財產租賃收入，資金之利息收入，公家之救濟或私人之資助，如撫恤金，養老金等，凡倚此爲生活者，爲無業。（二）一個人同時有兩種以上職業者，以其有直接報酬者爲主要職業。如兩種職業均有直接報酬，則以其所費工作時間較多者爲主要職業。調査時僅塡主要職業一種。（三）曾經有業，調査時因故休息者，例如因放假·臥病·應塡原有職業。（四）一向有業，調査時因未攬得工作，致休閑者，應填其原有職業。例如汽車站之挑夫，今日雖未攬得生意，仍應塡汽車站挑夫。（五）失業者，應塡其原有職業，在職位欄或服務處所欄，塡失業。（六）從未就業之人，縱然即將就業，然尙未從事是項作業者，仍應塡無業。（七）家屬帮助家長之作業者，增加家長或家庭之收入，但另無其他聯業者，以其帮助家長之作業爲職業。如另有獲得直接報酬之作業者，應以該獲有直接報酬之作業爲職業。（八）恃罪惡行爲爲生者，如娼妓·賭博·等，均爲無業。（未完）</p>

<p>吾國所得稅，發軔於二十五年，創辦未久，適逢戰事，政府西遷，沿海淪喪，關　統各稅銳减，所得稅迫於環境需要；稅收猛普，成爲國稅主要來源，考諸英美先進國家，其所得稅亦產生於戰時，如英國所得稅產生於一七九八年拿破崙大戰，法國所得稅產生於第一次世界大戰，美國所得稅產生於解放黑奴南北戰爭，吾國所得稅產生於七七蘆溝橋抗戰之時，可謂後先輝映。</p>
<p>去年日寇屈膝，國土重光，政府以過去八年係試辦性質，因陋就簡，缺點在所不免，乃於本年四月十六日公佈新所得稅法，考其內容。業將舊所得稅法缺點均加修改，並能參酌實際情形，漸趨合理化，茲將新舊所得稅法加以比較硏究，以供檢討。</p>
<p>（二）新舊比較</p>
<p>吾國舊所得稅法計二十二條，新所得稅法計四十二條，現將其相異　進步之處，臚述如下：</p>
<p>（一）併入財產租賃所得，而將財產出賣所得廢止。</p>
<p>吾國舊所得稅法，分一，營利事業所得，二，薪給報酬所得，三，證券存款所得三類，三十二年參酌環境需要，另於一月二十六日公佈財產租賃出賣所得稅法單行條例，征收土地房屋堆棧碼頭森林礦塲舟車機械之租賃所得及出賣所得，夫財產出賣，均係土地買賣，吾國土地本有地價稅·契稅·土地增値稅等項，而直接稅局於土地買賣之間，仍袖財產出賣所得稅，似有軍複之嫌，故此次新所得稅法中，將財產出賣所得廢止，極爲合理，以至於所餘財產租賃所得稅，新稅法將其列入第四類，同時增加漁塲一項，並將土地房屋堆棧森林礦塲漁塲與碼頭舟車機械之租賃所得分別輕重課稅，後者除按前者規定外，每加征十分之一。　（二）工商事業，公司或非公司組織分別課稅</p>
<p>營利事業包括公司·商號·等組織，舊所得稅法規定（第一條第一類甲項）凡公司商號行棧工廠，或個人資本，在二千元以上營利之所得，不論其獨資，合資，公司非公司，一體課稅，而新所得稅法將營利事業所得（第二條第一類）項下將股份有限公司，股份兩合公司有限公司營利所得與無限公司兩合公司合夥獨資及其他組織營利事業之所得，分別課稅，前者所得，合資本實額未滿百分之五者爲免稅點，後者所得，未滿十五萬元者爲免稅點，所得屬於製造業者，其稅額依前項規定减征１０％，値此建國伊始，富民強國，再以工業資金週轉慢，商業資金週轉快，現今工業頻於破產，商業投機利潤　優厚之時，均棄工業而從商業投機，以致市塲投機風熾，游資充斥，立法者爲减輕工業負擔，規定製造業之稅率，依規定减輕十％，實屬一大進步，再公司與非公司之分別課稅，意在獎勵公司組織因有限公司股份有限公司等，靠股本靠金錢，無限公司合夥獨資，靠私人，靠信用，新所得稅法能作進一步分析，獎勵前者組織，亦屬得常。</p>
<p>（三）業務或技藝報酬與薪給報酬區別課稅</p>
<p>舊所得稅法規定，（見第一條第二類）凡公務人員自由職業者及其他從事各業者薪給報酬，其稅率相同，而新所得稅法（見第二條第一類）將薪給報酬所得中分（甲）業務或技藝報酬之所得，（乙）　報酬之所得二項，在所得稅法施行細則中詳細規定，田項指律師會計師工程師醫　師及戲劇藝員演員等（第卅三條），乙項指公務人員及被雇用之自由職業者，前者免稅點是未超過十五萬元者，後者免稅點是每月所得未超過五萬元者，因前者所得較流動，後者較固定，同時前者所得較後者常較多，立法者能詳盡分析，實一進步</p>
<p>（四）國營事業一律課稅</p>
<p>吾國國營事業，本不課稅，其理由是國營事業課稅與不課稅，實異途同歸，俗語云，「羊毛出在羊身上」，均係國庫之錢，初視之，似屬有理，細析之，國營獨不課稅，實有未妥，茲臚述理由如下。</p>
<p>一，舊所得稅法規定官商合辦營利事業之所得，應繳營利所得稅，按此條例而言，官商合資者課稅，商人獨資者課稅。獨國營者不課稅，况國營事業又無獨佔性質者，（獨佔性質者不在內）以致官商合資或商人獨資者。其生產成本或售價，必比國營爲高，使官商合資者或民營者必無法競爭，爲站在保護民族工業立塲，國營事業確不應免稅，此其理由一</p>
<p>二，國營獨不課稅，其成本與售價較低，使主特者不肯力求改進，倘一律課稅，形成「適者生存」競爭狀態，主持者必須當心主持力求改進，於國家，於人民，均有裨益，吾國過去國營事業經營失敗，興此不無關係，此其理由二。</p>
<p>三，國營事業若不課稅，其盈餘繳庫之時，包括一部份稅款，爲求統計數字正確，盈餘與稅額均應劃分，此其理由三</p>
<p>基於上述三點理由，國營事業應一律課稅，此次新所得稅法（見新所得稅法施行細則第三條）規定，「本法所稱營利事業，包括各級政府所辦公營事業及官商合辦事業在內」此實極大進步，想今後民營與國營均可在平等原則之下，互相競爭，同時主持國營事業者，當時具戒心，亦可剷除國營事業弊端之一，上述三點，係新所得稅法犖犖大者之進步，尙有綜合所得稅開征，在吾國所得稅史上實有劃時代意義，特在下節專述。（未完）</p>

<h3 id="c121">兩大民族的一個新試煉　中國主權在香港（下） <a href="#c121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>— 特約記者凌芳</p>
<p>本報十九日香港航訊</p>
<p>繼港府發言人之後，我外交駐遷當局亦應就我國立塲對九龍城問題，發表了正式聲明，讓關懷祖國的僑胞獲得一個正確的認識。果然，恰在記者寄稿的前刻，接獲我外部兩廣特派員郭德華十六日下午已會見港督楊慕琦，聲明「中國政府將不放棄條約權益，九龍城設治正在進行。」對我官方這個正式聲明，僑胞所能引起的反響，是不言可喩。這個事件發展下去，我國的主權在香港，將有一種嶄新的表現了</p>
<p>一個多月前，我司法行政部參事倪徽噢山英倫聯同英駐華新火使施諦文過港返京後，本港新生晚報於七月廿九日便發表了「我國短期內將在九龍設法庭」那個轟動僑胞心弦的消息。新生晚報言之　　的說；</p>
<p>本報記者頃從最可靠方面探得消息，我國在最短期內，將在九龍方面，設立法院，推事山我國司法行政部委派，凡中外民刑案件，統由我國法院辦理，其性質與上海租界未撤銷以前之第一第二特區法院相同。</p>
<p>此法院爲我國寶安地方法院之九龍分庭。我國司法當局認定，香港爲割讓地，而九龍爲租界，在</p>
<p>九龍設中國法院</p>
<p>實爲國際法所容許。在廣州未淪陷以前，廣州法院史院長延程，早回香港方面，進行交涉，現在我國司法行政部將舊事重提，並向英大使提出。</p>
<p>司法行政部的意見，認爲香港與中國，僅隔一衣帶水，而民衆之風俗習慣，亦無極大分別，但香港之法例，與中國之法例差別甚多。例如：（一）中國女子當然有繼承權及特留份，（編者按，特留份者，即死者遺產之一半，應爲繼承人所當然平均領受，而不能由死者自由支配），而香港中國女子無繼承權。（二）在香港，有夫之婦與人通姦，須坐牢六月，而有婦之夫與人通姦，則無罪名，此與中國法律違背；（三）在香港，長子嫡孫（即承重孫），有特殊之地位，而中國民法法典，早將此種封建之立法制度廢除。我國司法行政部，極希望中國與香港法律上之歧異，能早日廢除。</p>
<p>我國司法界指出，香港法院判案，乃根據一八四三年前之中國法律，但此種法律，已爲中國民法法典所揚棄，故在九龍設立中國法院以前，不能不求法律觀念之混同，否則，對於人民之權利義務將難於確定。</p>
<p>關於九龍法庭之庭長人潠，我司法當局，現正縝密加以考慮，蓋特別庭庭長在中國法吏之銓叙上，地位不高，但所負責任甚爲重要，我國擬在本港之華人律師中，衡銓適當人物，目前尙未決定。</p>
<p>新生晚報仍在英國統治下的杳港，單獨發表這個驚人的消息，自然有充分的論據，才敢暢所欲言，聽說這個問題曾令到港府當局發生相當的不愉快。翌日港府新聞處便發表一個聲明，否認這個消息：「香港政府對於新生晚報於七月廿九日所登載中國法庭將於最近將來在九龍設立之消息，已加以注意。香港政府欲大衆週知，羣項消息完全失實。關於在英屬領土，不論割讓或租借地區，設立中國法庭之談判，從米提及，亦未嘗予以考慮。」</p>
<p>然而，因爲事實俱在，這是不容否認的。新生晚報當日爲了港府這個聲明，認爲該報報譽遭受一個重大損失，便向港府提出交涉，港府報不過新生晚報的爭持，便也讓新生晚報來一個對港府聲明的聲明，挽回已損失的報譽。新生晚報於八月一日發表聲明道。</p>
<p>「……香港政府的聲明，是包括現在，而不包括將來，是聲明事實，而不排除國際法的原理，以及中國政府之意岡的。</p>
<p>在中英邦交敦睦的今日，我們之刋登這一個消息，是作爲一個國際法上的問題。中英兩國，都是崇信法律的民族，在法律的前面，自然都可以當得起試鍊的。所以我們也得聲明。我們『登這一個消息，以及這一個聲明，對於中英邦交友好的前途，我們是時時都加以考慮的。」</p>
<p>新生晚報當日在那　聲明之上，還刋出一段「中英將予討論香港未來地位」的七月二十三日新加坡航訊說：「英國新任駐華大使中施諦文於離新加坡赴南京前宣稱云：蔣主席與英政府在適當時間討論香港未來的地位。蔣主席已表示將討論香港歸還中國問題，他要討論這件事似無問題，這也是英國政府的態度。」</p>
<p>借英大使的談話</p>
<p>引起僑胞對香港未來地位的認識，間接回應「我國短期內將在九龍設法庭」的話。僑胞根據種種事實，港府雖有聲明，他們還是相信中國法庭與中國海關相同，將依國際法例在九龍租借地上出現。（我國在九龍設有佔全國出入口第二位的九龍關）我當局旣有意圖於先，當必有結果於後的。</p>
<p>談香港問題的人，很多祇知道有香港而不知有九龍新界。在條約上，香港是割讓地，九龍新界是租借地。在地理上，香港是海島，九龍新界是大陸。前者面積祗廿英方里，後者達二百八十六英方里。單有香港島而沒有對岸九龍新界，則香港是一個名符其實的孤島。九龍是香港的脊樑，上次日軍是先陷九龍才進攻香港的。英人一八四二年取得香港島後，一八六零年（北京條約）便加佔對岸九龍半島的尖端兩三英方里的土地，便有新九龍和老九龍的區分。再到了一八九八年英人更租借九龍以北一大塊土地和若干島嶼，定名新界，才展開香港今日的局面，所以，在一般人看來，所謂香港，就是包括九龍新界而言，道是不能不加辨別的。上月港督宣佈香港新政體時，對市政委員會所屬的行政區，初期亦僅以香港島九龍及新九龍爲限，可見即就英人的立塲，也不把香港九龍新界混爲一談。戰後不平等條約業已廢除，中英邦交已有劃時代的轉變，英人一時縱不能放棄香港，但九龍新界儘應提前交還我們。我們爲了顧全兩大民族的交誼，香港鳥的收回縱可稍待時日，但九龍新界的恢復主權，似不容再可蹉跎，而引起諸不多必要的掣肘。如國軍過江北上及其他運輸和交通問題）。所以，九龍設法庭和九龍城設治的問題，連一接二而起。在我們方面，固應作縝密的考慮，周詳的規劃，澈底的進行，以求恢復國土主權的完整。在英人方面，亦須認識時代的轉變，正視現實的需要，作善意的表示，以修睦中英兩大民族的友誼。我們不是「操之過急」，就是「永保沉默」的表示，固然不對，英方「强詞奪理」或「迷戀過去」的態度，亦不見得高明。說　上述兩個事件，港府輿其不問事實，硬作「此地無銀三百兩」的聲明，（即使在砲艦威脅下，也不容易强人信服）何如開誠佈公與中國方面尋求最合理的解決——有了問題，終歸是要解決的。</p>
<p>爲了香港問題，中英兩大民族已面臨一個歷史的試練。兩大民族在戰時能够全力合作，打倒共同的敵，難道在戰後就不能完全諒解，對本身的問題取得圓滿的解決嗎？</p>

<h3 id="c122">兩西報　同聲呌囂 <a href="#c122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>九龍城設治問題經港府在本月十四日發表聲明後，十六日兩廣外交特派員郭德華奉我外部訓令，向港楊慕琦作「我政府將不放棄條約權益」的聲明，翌日我外部發言人情報司長何鳳山在京針對港府的聲明發表談話，英駐華大使館人員亦發表談話，再加上滬粵各方面的響應和嚴正表示，這個問題已由地方問題變爲中英邦交上的一個問題。這問題的起因及其經過，上文已經作了詳細的報道，茲再就迎日來港中輿論界和僑胞對道問題的反響，摘要分析，以爲關心的讀者吿。</p>
<p>在兩廣外交特派員郭德華正式向港府表示我政府的意見前，港中與論界除新生晚報和工商晚報外，其他還未有任何表示（該兩晚報的意見，已見上次通訊）港中僑報的言論，似還震懾於三個月前的國民日報事件，對港府那條「可大可小」的防衛法，倒有幾分「談虎色變」！迨外交特派員和外部發言人相繼作嚴正表示後，星島晚報，國民日報，中國日報，才陸續著論檢討這個問題。但牠們仍然爲環境所限，未能暢所欲言：</p>
<p>星島晚報十八日以「關於九龍城設治問題」爲題，引證條約，認爲「九龍城治權之屬於中國，當爲不爭的事實」，最後根據我外部發言人的談話，「希望九龍城設治儘速恢復，儘速進行。」國民日報對港府十四日的聲明，十五日不予發表，至郭德華向港督作反聲明後，才於十七日把兩項聲明聯同刋出，這可算是一個「獨具隻眼」的措施，十九日，該報寫了一篇「九龍城地位問題」的社論，證明「九龍城的主權始終是　於中國的」，該報針對南京英大使館發言人所說，九龍城的地位乃係一種「條約解釋」問題的話稱，「在中英的友誼和諒解下，彼此很不妨碍條約來考究考究……我們相信誰也不會固執己見的。」廿日，復以原有社論的地位，轉載杭州大同日報的「今日的香港問題」一稿，並發表「九龍　城滄桑錄」的特寫。</p>
<p>中國日報廿日那篇題名「九龍城設治問題」的社論，比較設得明快有力：該報說：「……在中英兩國邦交敦睦的今日，在英國宣佈放棄不平等條約後的今日，彼此還須斤於不平等條約內</p>
<p>一城一池的爭執</p>
<p>我們祇有覺得慚愧，覺得遺憾，別無他言。……我們希望英國當局高瞻遠編，從遠處大處着眼，千萬別因此種小事，抱殘守缺，致彼此都感覺不愉快……。」</p>
<p>我們回頭看看香港西報對這個問題的言論，我們實在感慨不盡！僑報的言論，多是半吞半吐，已如上述，有的且禁若寒輝，有的祇「旁敲側擊」，或轉載滬參議會上主席請求收回港九澳領土的原電，或刋載中國國民外交協會上海支會秘書長汪竹一那篇對九龍城設治問題的談話，有的甚至把郭德華對港府的聲明，也不敢全文刋載，僅略說「有所商洽」，充分表現他們的漢奸面目（華僑日報）……西報的言論便不同了，牠們明白袒護自己的國家，不惟强辭奪理，抑且冷嘲熱諷，所謂中英盟誼，早已拋在腦後。十八日那天，兩份西報南華早報和德臣西報都著論檢討九龍城問題。南華早報一口咬定「此事無足新頴，亦不引起刺激」。該報說：「在地理上，經濟上，社會上，九龍城是香港殖民地的一部分，中國治權就算在城裏建立，那對中國無益，對當地人民亦無利。」該報認爲倘中國政府堅持是項要求，當爲「很有組織的」，乃建議倫敦與南京直接談判，而不應當作地方事件辦理。該報指這個問題爲「戰後的神經病」，並說「任由自稱『愛國者』的人來搞牠，實在可惜」。德臣西報說：「這一個荒廢而祇餘破屋數椽的城，相信無論何人總可一致認爲對中國政府無甚重要。條約成立已逾半世紀，相安無事，今忽提出收回，相信對中英邦交無大裨益，反引起麻煩和不協調吧了。」該報好像還要怪責我們不識相；「如中國堅以爲此一小事，而引起嚴重注意，便應循正式途徑提出意見。」——那是何等的口氣！</p>
<p>不特此也，南華早報的「鳥瞰攔」——一種「三言兩語」的雜評文字——尤充分露出</p>
<p>一副險詐的面孔</p>
<p>如十九日那一段說：「馬士灣的中國漁村被一批携機關槍和手溜彈的海賊所刦掠。九龍的市民們，請看」二十日又有一段說：『據大公報說「太平洋戰事之初，華軍日夜兼程馳救香港」，但趕至現在還未趕到，倒有點來遲了』。假如說南華早報的叫囂不做一個「紳士」，則德臣西報的胡說八道，簡直是「無賴」了！德臣西報對汪竹一那段談話以「嘸哼」！那些具有輕蔑字眼作標題，我外部發言人情報司長對港府聲明的談話，該報亦竟冠以「呸啐！」兩字的標題，請問是何居心？該報這種態度已引起僑胞極大的反感。假如僑報對港府那段聲明以「呸啐！」兩字作標題，港府又將如之何？德臣西報一再失儀，可見港中大多數英人對我國的眞正態度與九龍城問題——我國收回失地恢復主權的問題——激起他們如何的氣憤！</p>
<p>九龍城設治問題，經各方面的表示，現已變爲當前中英邦交的一個問題，港中僑胞正懇切地盼望我政府下大決心立刻與英方正式開始收回港九的談判，對這百年來的問題作一總淸算！</p>

<p>此次市政府民政處長張曉崧，代表民政處向參議會提案：撥用寺廟房屋爲自治機構辦公處，因有『像玉佛寺，靜安寺等一類和尙，專門軋姘頭又麻將』兩句話，觸動了和尙的肝火，以爲是摧殘宗敎，侮辱和尙，於是結隊請願，要求市參會撤銷已通過的：『撥用或借用寺廟房屋爲自治機構辦公處　的原案，並要求市府撤懲張曉崧，一面公然登報，要求張曉崧書面道歉。</p>
<p>我們看到和尙上面幾種舉動以後，突在有些心中不平，張曉崧的提議：是撥用寺廟房屋，作爲自治機構的辦公處，這裏很明顯的是，可以撥用的，當然是寺廟空餘房屋的一部，而不是所有寺廟房屋的全部，更非沒收寺廟產權之謂，與和尙自己的房屋也不相關，根本談不到摧殘宗敎，我敢武斷的認定張曉崧所提議撥用寺廟房屋的語句裏面，並沒有趕出和尙的意思存在其間，張曉崧提案的用意，不過是以寺廟有餘的空屋，補自治機構辦公處的不足而已。現在市府規定，民間如有空屋，必須出租，查民間的空屋，是私有產權，在屋荒嚴重的今日，政府尙住要强制其出租，何况寺廟的空屋，多數是化緣或捐助所造成的產業，在屋荒嚴重的今日，撥用一部作爲自治機構辦公，誰謂不宜？參議會通過此案時，在撥用下加「或借用』三字，已經防到佛法無邊，不料和尙請願的要求，竟欲將全案撤銷。</p>
<p>總之，張曉崧的提案，是爲公，並不是爲私，現在他爲了自治機構的辦公地點，受到和尙的無理攻擊，我們市民，應該一致起來援助，並要求當局設立一「寺廟空屋租賃管理委員會」專司其事，請看現在全國都在閙着屋荒，只有寺廟的廣厦，都空着，租用寺廟空屋，作爲自治機關，或地方行政機構的辦公地點，是絕對合理的舉動，決不是摧殘宗敎。我勸和尙也不要仗着佛法無邊，要本着慈悲爲懷，方便爲門，那才像是佛門子弟。（郭永熙）</p>

<p>讀者住上海縣第二區曹行鎭，鄰居一老媼，求乞度日，本月八日晨，得保甲長之知照，囑往塘灣鎭區公所，領取行政院救濟署，救濟麵粉，媼即往領，比至，有監放員（行政院救濟總署蘇寗分署專員）竟予拒絕，經該區公所職員根據戶口冊證明該媼確係貧發，且亦列入名冊之內者，而監放員強欲得保甲長之證明書，然後發放，不得已，媼唯有返鎭，要求保甲長書面證明再往，一六十餘歲之老貧婦，往返十餘里之路，又饑又勞，趕至區公所，已午後五時，而發放大員，均已離去，詢諸區公所職員，據云：「麵粉尙存八十餘袋，因辦公時間已過，汝等自願放棄，沒有了。因此事爲救濟署所辦，區公所無權顧問，完全由監放員主持」云云。竊思救濟署經辦救濟事業，當以救濟爲主者，當不爲時間所限止，該監放員於區境內尙存有大量麵粉，而發放時竟藉故留難，輕視救濟工作，藐忽責任，試問天良何在？莫怪小民再不敢妄想天半朱霞了！（王金祥）</p>

<p>編輯先生：鄙人有幾個小意見，借貴報「讀者意見」欄刋登。</p>
<p>（一）上海市國民身份證，報上說過當局宣布頒發完竣，何以黃浦區尙有未曾領到？</p>
<p>（二）本市娛樂塲所以及旅館浴室，售價之高，已達極點，遠非平民階級所能負荷，且其升漲之快，實較其他物品爲甚，以前尙謂米貴可以藉口，現在米價下降，漲勢依然如昔，此種急性膨脹，刺激一般物價，不知當局，有無顧及，並予以限制。</p>
<p>（三）肅淸貪汚，必先安定公務員生活，否則敦品勵行之士，絕足仕途，蓋祿不足以養廉，何能安心工作。貪汚之徒，深入要津，營私舞弊，上下其手，十官九貪之現象，亟應改善與嚴懲，務使貪汚絕跡，社會安寗，實利賴之。（孫少侯）</p>

<p>編輯先生：自房屋戰時租賃法廢止後，上海法院房屋糾紛案特多，大半因出租人向承租人苛索不遂，藉口收回自用，實則另祖他人，以達余條自的。故釀成嚴重之人爲房荒。立法院爲保障人民居住安全，特商討租賃條例；望當局於該條例未頒佈前，對於房屋糾紛案暫緩判決。倘仍根據戰前法律，則薪水階級輩，流離失所，益不堪設想矣。（金明鏡）</p>

<p>— 崇楨</p>
<p>十二日揚州訊</p>
<p>時届中秋，天上月　，一舉首望　月，低頭思故鄕」，值此佳節，蘇北漫天烽火，我這一顆遊子的心情，怎能不想念故鄉呢？</p>
<p>因此，我披着滿身的風沙，踏着沉重的步子，馳聘在六楊公路上（六圩至揚州，）終於回到久別了的故鄕。</p>
<p>在汽車裏，向窗外瞭望，公路兩旁草木全無，一片凄凉與寂寞，跟從前十里珠　，垂楊夾這，那一種古廣陵旖旎豪邁的風情相對照，眞不勝今昔之感。「二十四橋明月後，玉人何處敎吹蕭？」的憶念，又重　了我那久經飄泊的心靈。不過今日歸來，人事巳遷，「昔日兒童皆長大，常年親友半　　低徊凝想，我悵惘地步進一這龍罩着憂鬱氣氛的古城。</p>
<p>當今蘇北戰局，在趨於似緊張又似平靜的狀態中。我曾有機會分訪了在揚的軍政首長，叩詢蘇北局勢，對這「謎」似的局面，得到下少明確的解答。</p>
<p>會見張縣長</p>
<p>七日上午，會見了張濟傳縣長，他正忙於計劃着安頓絡繹不絕，逃亡到揚州來的五萬多的難民，他說：「這數字已佔着全城之三分之一，平均每保約有三甲，都是從共區中逃出來的難民。這一批難民，將增加了揚州城內人民意外的負担，然而，揚州的因民並不因此而恐慌，物價也並不此而增高，相反的他們同情這些難民不幸的遭遇，很能予以熱情的援助。他們現在是太熟悉於共軍種種毒辣殘酷的手段了：不管大資。小資，貧民，每人只准種三畝田；命田主繳出田契；「有飯大家吃」的口號，煽動與號召地痞流氓主持鬥爭；—這些，使他們分外地感到　生活在國軍　保護下的溫</p>
<p>目前的情況，共軍是無法威脅揚州的。城防戒備極嚴，四郊防衛鞏固。東至戴橋（距城五十里），南至李典鎭人，（距城卅里），西至大議，（距城六十里），北至三里　，（距城廿七里），均在國軍與縣自衛隊的控制中。所以，揚州的人民，都在異常安靜的生活着。</p>
<p>關於公路方面，大半已經修復。揚泰公路，（揚州至泰州），揚儀公路，（揚州至儀徵），皆已暢通。揚天公路，（揚州至天長），已通至大儀。惟最　的一條公路，是從六圩至揚州，高低起伏不平，汽車行駛危險萬分，目前由鎭揚公司等積極趕修中，約一月可竣工。教育方面：學校比戰前增多，中學省立兩所，縣立一所，私立有八所，小學約廿餘所。因此，失學學生較少，敎育可無問題。</p>
<p>風景區的瘦西湖，在淪陷期中憔悴了，本來已組織風量區整理委員會預備整理，因爲經費與時局關係。無形中不得不擱置起來。</p>
<p>蘇北的近況</p>
<p>談到此地，我就與張縣長怱忽的吿辭。我探知八月初旬林專員吳副司令（現調任泰興縣長）等，曾費了兩旬的時間去視察黃橋·姜堰，如臯，海安等地。</p>
<p>我設法尋到了有過交誼的專署劉視察的私寓，想探聽一些關於視察的經過，年靑人的情感使他滔滔不絕的講出了許多寶貴的資料。</p>
<p>兩月以來、蘇北局勢曾）度嚴重，幸賴國軍沉着應付，暫吿平靜。自從共軍猛撲泰興未逞後，野心未死，伺隙而動，等到東綫黃橋，姜堰，如臯，海安，相綱爲國軍克復，國軍因欲避免內戰烽火擴大，故未乘勝沿范堤追擊『不料共軍竟藉此機會再度反攻，遂使黃橋復陷，如皋危急，共軍蓄意內戰，破壞和平，在這裏又得到了一個　力的證明。</p>
<p>國軍一向處於防禦地位，絕不輕舉妄動，違背協規定；必不得已時方採取自衛。因此，在行軍調防中，往　遭遇共軍不意的　擊，使　軍無可奈何的還擊，忍痛的還擊。結果，人民弄得驚惶無揹。萬一該地再被共軍佔領，則人民之痛苦，絕非　墨所能描寫。任憑共軍用各種手段宣傳，欺騙民衆，終因事實的證明，而失去民心。因此，當國軍奉命調駐他地，當地民衆都痛哭失聲，竭力挽留，最後只有失望的夾道歡送，直待國軍的行列這一個影子也見不到時。每個老百姓才懊喪的回家去。</p>
<p>所以，老百姓對國軍有一種希望，「旣來勿走」，—因爲國軍到了一個地方駐紥以後，共軍一定是知道的，等國軍一走，共軍馬上開到，大肆騷擾，洗刧一空。「旣走速來」，民衆仍整日盼望國軍早日再來。老百姓的批判總是這樣有力的表現着。</p>
<p>其實，共軍這次在蘇北也是孤注一擲，企圖佔領整個蘇北，威脅京滬。國軍僅處於被動地位，絕不願主動的攻擊。若論軍隊士氣與戰鬥力，實在是共軍所不能想像的。每每國軍一連或一排駐入一個碉堡內，共軍都是以一團或一營兵力想解決國軍，結果終難得逞，國軍並不因此驕傲，依舊堅守自已的崗位，執行他的任務與使命。</p>
<p>種種的問題</p>
<p>最近國軍收復的縣鎮，經濟方面，因爲共軍盤踞已久，且因它曾濫發抗幣，人民蒙受的影響很大，希望政府能早日設立銀行，妥善處理此事。土地方面，在共軍統制下，濫施分割，土地業權凌亂萬分，許多原業主要求收回，希望國軍把那些帮助共軍共同蹂躪人民，混水摸魚的光棍，重重的嚴辦，另一方面請求公平方法整頓田地業權問題。</p>
<p>人口方面，因共軍無法招兵，且補充不易，於是在解放一區內，盡量強徵壯丁，十八歲至四十五歲的男子，一律强迫入伍，予以極短期訓練，即開赴前綫與國軍作戰，結果，悉數白白犠牲做了他們的砲灰。年靑女子的抽微。亦難倖免。因此，地方人口大减，剩下的都是老弱之輩。許多田地無人去種，食糧　穫大成問題，這是共軍所賜。蘇　最大的恩惠。</p>
<p>最後，他吿訴我：目前　蘇北境內，沒有一個共軍的，只人有兩縣：即揚　與江浦。</p>
<p>劉視察的話吿了一個結束，我因爲要到傷兵醫院去看一看，就此和他緊緊地握手道別。</p>
<p>連長的控訴</p>
<p>三個傷兵醫院，我　次第的巡禮了一番，每到一個醫院，都由那些白衣使者陪伴着我，從他（她）們沉痛的談吐中，知道了共軍使用的武器多半是敵人的。尤其是一個身中四彈負了重傷的連長控訴似的吿訴我在邵伯戰役中。共軍的砲手與重兵器射手，皆爲敵俘。第一綫部　都是利用日俘與十八歲到二十歲左右的靑年，他們的基幹皆留在後方，絕不輕易犧牲，讓那些無辜的靑年送死。「我總以爲抗戰結束，可以凱旋返故鄕，誰想到共產黨會　動內戰呢？我的負傷，不是共產黨害我的嗎？我並不願意內戰，然而沒有辦法，我不自衛，共軍就要我的命。他們破壞了我家庭的幸福，破壞了國家的和平，我誓死與共軍拚命到底。」我聽了他這一番慷慨激昂的話，使我無限的感動，馬上去安慰他，勸他好好的養傷。</p>
<p>共俘卅五名</p>
<p>有一個醫院裏，住着卅五個負塲的俘　，由野戰醫院第二療養所王醫宮引導着我。進入了他們的病室，對於那卅五個共軍俘虜的而孔，那就是「年靑，力壯，好老百姓。」我很同情他們的處境，情感支配着我很關懷的採詢他們過去的身世略述於下：周傳洪—新四軍之連指導員，揚州人，廿五歲，初小畢業，家有五口。務農，卅四年四月被迪加入共軍，首先任地方衛隊（即民兵隊）隊長，勝利後，共軍揚言敵寇拒絕投降，遂將他騙入前綫，担任指導員工作，此次在小四莊（揚州東鄉）因傷被俘。</p>
<p>褚慶—新四軍士兵，合肥人，廿二歲，智識水準尙可，家道小康，有田一百二十畝，皆被共軍鬥爭一光，只留下十五畝〔五口，每人三畝），因此，三十四年六月，遂被迫人伍，其時抽徵的名義是打日本人，豈知訓練三月後，和國軍自相殘殺，自知受騙，無可奈何，逃也無法逃，此次在天長負傷被國軍俘虜，他非常高興，從此可以重見天日矣。</p>
<p>楊金根—新四軍士兵鎭江人，十七歲，種田出身，卅四年八月被共軍從江南强迫調出充當士兵，其藉口爲赴江北接收及受降，誰知道共軍是欺騙他呢？如今在邵伯戰役中因與國軍內戰負傷了，他很痛苦想回江南故鄕去。</p>
<p>其他卅二個俘虜，大半是農人子弟出身，家裏的田被共軍鬭光了，才被强迫加入新四軍。一小時後，我帶着同情的目光，吿別了那卅五個負傷的共軍俘虜。出了醫院，心裏一陣陣不住地跳，爲那些不幸命運的遭遇者憐惜。</p>
<p>揚中亂收費</p>
<p>次日中午，我準備返滬了，一個親戚約我吃飯，三番兩次的來邀請，使我無法推辭。席間，陌生的客人帶來了一個轟動揚州城的消息，省立揚州中學除學費外，尙征收敎師生活補助費，每一學生一萬八千元，聞悉之下，甚爲驚奇，以至於不敢相信。餐後，偶而見到江都日報，所載省立揚州中學學生家長告各界人士書的文字，證實了那位客人的話是千眞萬確。頓時，腦海中不停地思索省揚中爲何有這種舉動，想來想去，總想不出，我畢竟懷疑，以省揚中全校一千二百個學生計算，這一筆將近兩千萬的鉅款，拿來供給敎師生活之不足原是名正言順，然而自居省立中學，敎職員都是列入公務員之列，有政府的固定薪水，而且，敎部亦曾訓令通飭各校恪遵規定辦法，不准搜自違背，强徵敎師生活補助費，對於省揚中這一種冒昧的舉動，不禁使我們感覺萬分的遺憾。尊師重道，是學生應有的行爲，但學生並未出自內心，而敎師自己發動尊師，豈非變態的尊師？故鄕小住兩日，印象甚深，以上所記，不過什之一二，聊以表示我對凋零的邦江的情感而已。</p>

<h3 id="c136">中國怎樣工業化？ <a href="#c136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>— 鄧紹裘譯</p>
<p>一個戰後五年計劃的綱要</p>
<p>去年八月美國的對外經濟處供應局工程部發表了一篇題名「中國工業化指南—一個戰後五年計劃的基本要素」。十月，又發表了續篇，至今年六月，又以該二篇設計的大槪編成節略，茲爰譯出爲供研究關心中國工業建設復興之參考。譯者紹裘誌。</p>
<p>（一）中國工業化的目的</p>
<p>中國現有四萬萬五千萬的人民代表全世界人口的五分之一，但中國不是一個於衆多城市集聚而成的國家，而是於鄕村，農田併合而立的，百分之八十五的人民就是依靠它而生活。所以中國，今日的中國如何才可以在數十年內變成一個工業國，究竟依照什麽速度，這些都是基本的問題，而美國工業化是經過了百年的努力才得成功的，所以這本指南就是予以鼓勵的幫助，給中國怎樣工業化徬徨的計劃路程中，一個五年初步計劃的基本要素。</p>
<p>在理想中，這本指南設被中國採用，在一個廣泛的工業建設程序中，那末對中國的利益可槪括如下：</p>
<p>（一）可以完成了工業化的初步基礎建設，以備將來作第二步完美平衍的發展。</p>
<p>（二）使人力轉化而爲生產之用，而使經營的技術及生產的各種技巧得以發展。</p>
<p>（三）農礦資源得以充分利用。</p>
<p>（四）因生活程度的提高後國民收入亦得以普遍增加，而生產亦因之可成依倍比定律增大。</p>
<p>（五）生產增加，一方面可以促進國際貿易，又一方面可以還償淸款。</p>
<p>（六）政府收入增加，而政府政治經濟機構亦可得以加强。</p>
<p>（二）中國工業化的計劃</p>
<p>事實上中國工業化早已在中日戰爭之前就開始了，那時，中國就有不少已具規模的煉鋼廠。化學工廠，黏料工廠，但是八年來又有什麽成績可言呢，其癥結所在，就是缺乏一個最實際和有效的辦法計劃，以應付正在擴大發展的中國工業，所以現在中國怎樣工業化呢，就該有着一有秩序的效力的計劃</p>
<p>（一）在中國本部建立工業中心</p>
<p>（二）擴大出口的貿易。</p>
<p>（三）戰前損害及現存的工業計劃以向平時工業的轉化。</p>
<p>（四）仿照蘇國田納西河流域水利工程的水利及水電工程的發展</p>
<p>在這四個計劃步驟中，第一個項目因爲中國在發展工業經濟中的最大需要，是建立許多基本工業，而以爲大規模工業化的基礎，然關於這建立和發展的計劃，必須依賴目前所有更詳盡的關於中國資源和狀况的測勘。而至於擴大出口貿易方面的計劃，大部涉及廣泛的國際貿易問題，所以可以認爲是一個經濟問題，而不是工程問題，關於戰前損害及現存的工業轉化問題，亦須待各種工業之狀况性質充分報吿獲得後，始可着手而加以特殊的分析，而至於水利工程以及水電工程的未來發展，極爲重要，而更需要多年的區械研究設計和建設不過關於這方面的發展的初步研究，已由美國墾植局設計總工程師薩凡奇博士，奉美國務院之命，來中國視察，設計Ｔ·V·A·型式的揚子江水閘等水利工程。</p>
<p>（三）中國工業化的步驟</p>
<p>（一）選擇幾種爲中國人民物質生活所必需的幾件工業的發展再以開發天然資源，並用作基礎—種子，這許多種子開發結果，將供給基本的工具材料零件，以助長未來的工業發展。</p>
<p>（二）適應需要以及工作能力經濟的生產單位而決定工廠的範圍大小。但工業發展必談平衡—即工廠之大小及種類亦須適合而一律—藉使各種工業均能得到保障與相互支持援助。</p>
<p>（三）運輸工具之改良和擴大，因爲原料燃料電力水力運輸等與勞力，乃可決定工業，分配，以至於將來前途之發展。</p>
<p>（四）熟練的工人，技師及管理人才的訓練，因中國技工缺乏，而相反多數人民都需要工作及訓練。</p>
<p>（五）作爲工業設計一部份的工業發生，必得使高度機械化動作與適於早期工業發展的低度機械工作相合。</p>
<p>（四）中國工業化所需的財力</p>
<p>這計劃需要的財力有如下表：錢數以美金千元爲單位。</p>
<p>附運輸工業所需建設的財力鐵道（改良及擴大各鐵路系統）　需五〇三，七五〇公路（四季通行的公路）　需一六五，四〇〇自動車（商業性貨車隊及店舖）　需二二三，四八〇河流交通（改良水上運輸）　需四〇六，三〇〇其他　需　四五，〇〇〇小計　一三四八，九三〇總計　三〇二七，六〇三</p>
<p>（附說明）上一表中所謂工廠建設費用的估計，係指房屋建築及設備裝置，而其他如財產錄營業資本槪未列入。</p>
<p>又上一表中所謂「其他費用」乃包括初步機械工程的費用一千五百萬美金，及購買承利水電建設設備費三千萬元美金，</p>
<p>又上一表中電力工業，發電工業，以工業建設所需一百廿萬瓩電力計算（其中四十七萬瓩電力包括用於工廠建設用傳導錢千哩）</p>
<p>上二表中運輸工業，僅以鐵路公路水道爲最標準確實，河流運輸輸僅爲一約數，蓋材料不足。未能列舉數字，而空運雖亦異常重要，但未估計列入，蓋中國空運可能發展的程度至今實難確定</p>
<p>（五）中國怎樣工業化所需的勞力</p>
<p>（甲）工業</p>
<p>（千美金）化學工業　一一九·八五〇製造工業　四二·六四〇電力工業　九九·四二〇紡織工業　八四·三〇〇食品生產　二六七·四〇〇其他　一·〇〇〇小計　七五六·七一〇</p>
<p>（乙）運輸鐵道　八二·三〇〇公路　五〇〇自動車　一九三·一三〇河流交通　一〇〇小計　二七六·〇三〇總計　一〇三二·七四〇</p>
<p>（附註）上一·二表中就業人歡估計以直接生產及監督人員爲限，其他管理及推銷人員因各工廠工作塲所及內部組織不同，未計入，一表中所謂食品生產加工分配者內包括從車漁業者四十萬人。</p>
<p>大家說中國工業化的先決條件是高度的需要量。中國人民必需是中國商品　　　顧。中國人對於棉衣，香　　其他　製品的需量已相當可觀，加以近年萊奢侈品需要的迫切性，很可以替中國今後工業化鋪下一塊基石。</p>
<p>我看中國的工業假如欲健全化，那麽它的最大的問題—　是在於幹與不幹耳。</p>

<p>在普通一般工廠裏面，對於成本的計算，並不十分注意，甚至在有些工廠裏，即使設立了一個成本會計部份，在担任製造工作的人看來好像是多餘的有一般人的意見以爲與其把人力或時間費在成本會計上，毋寗從事於生產工作，更爲合算，這種見解，當然是錯誤的，事實上，因爲這些人往往是從一種小範圍的工塲裏出來的，所以不能了解成本會計的價値。</p>
<p>事實上，如果以成本會計作爲一種記錄一樣的東西，而帶有一點歷史的性質，那末，成本會計就不會有什麼了不起的功用，實在呢，成本會計的用度，可以分爲下列幾點：</p>
<p>Ａ成本會計可以指示我們一條生利的路，如果一個工廠單製造一種貨品那末就簡單得多，因爲只有二條路，一條是繼續生產，一條是停工，但一般工廠往往所製造的不祗一種貨品，那末，我們就要知道在幾種貨品之中那一種的利潤最厚？我們能不能把利潤最厚的貨品加多產量而把利潤較薄的貨品减少產量經過這樣一種更動就可以獲得更多的利潤要査出終究那一種貨品的利潤較厚就要用到成　本會計來　計算成本。</p>
<p>Ｂ市價上落無定的時候，在市價上落無定的時候我們就要受着市價的影響，如果是漲，那末漲到如何程度，如果是跌，那末跌到如何程度，我們的製成品漲跌，原料也要隨着有漲跌，在近幾年來，有時候製成品的市價一天天高漲，但原料的價格並不動，有時候原料的價格飛漲，然而製成品的價格並無更動，這種情形，前者與電力限制，米價高漲，影響工資等問題有關。後者與社會大衆的購買力薄弱有關，在這種市價漲落的時候，我們就要計算成本，終究我們所製造的貨品有沒有利潤可得，如果任憑市價漲落，自己毫無預算，那末虧了本自己還開得莫名其妙，在企業的經營上是絕對不應該有的現象。</p>
<p>Ｃ展望未來，一個工廠要謀將來的發展光要對於目前的一切，十分明瞭，知這了目前的成本和其他一切，方才可以展望未來。即以計算成本而論，如果我們知道了目前的成本，我們就可以估計，萬一將來的成本要增加二成或者三成，那末我們應該怎樣應付如果，要增加一倍至二倍，那末我們應常怎樣應付，道種對於未來的規劃，一定要根據目前的成本會計。</p>
<p>Ｄ分淸各部份的責任；一個工廠製造一種貨品，那末事情比較簡單，對於成本會計的需要也比較不如製造這許多貨品的工廠來得殷切，但在一個工廠而製造許多貨品的，那末我們就要借着成本會計，把各都份製造貨品的成本，加以計算，使各個部份的責任，有明白的規定，這雖則並不是一種企業對內的法則，但至少是一種很有用的參加，譬如在上月份某一部份的製造成本是每件一百元，到了本月份突然增加到二百元，那末主管部份，就要研究那增漲的理由，而看這理由是不是充足的。同時還可以根據幾個月來的記錄而展望、未來的情形。</p>
<p>Ｅ，市塲競爭劇烈的時候。在工商界裏，同業的競爭，是隨時存在着的但有時候的競爭，格外劇烈，諸如兩個廠家的貨品在市塲上都有地位，售價方面，因此有了限制不能自由增加，那末唯有從减低成本方面着想，要减低成本，第一步就要實行成本會計，又如有幾個工廠，同時要去參加一個機關的招標，實行投標，那對於成本也非要有準確的計算不可。</p>

<p>— 謝冰瑩</p>
<p>感謝上蒼，我抵山海關的第二天，幸好過着晴天。</p>
<p>吃過早點後，首先去車站打聽消息，知道去瀋陽的車仍然沒有開的消息，但徐站長好意地安慰我說：</p>
<p>「今天要開一列貨車去試試看，如果能趕着修好，也許明天可以通車。」</p>
<p>「不開客車嗎？」</p>
<p>「不能，因爲恐怕又發生覆車的事，寃枉地犧牲許多人命。」我想旣然不能走，我索性在山海關痛快地玩一天。</p>
<p>山海關是臨楡縣屬的一個周圍不到五里大的小市鎭，市面上呈現着簡樸的現象，城內的街道有的狹窄得只能行駛一輛汽車，有的寬到二三丈，舖面都是平房，間或也可看到很少數二三層的樓房，但仍然免不了帶着幾分土氣。</p>
<p>人們走在街上，非常安閒，絕不像大都市的人們的那麼慌慌張張，匆匆忙忙，這原因很簡單，因爲沒有橫衝直撞的汽車，也沒有什麽馬車三輪車來往，僅有的交通工具是洋車和驢子。</p>
<p>洋貨店裏的日用品，可以說應有盡有，但大半都是十年以前的，玻璃貨還沒有運來，小姑娘們仍然穿着紅褲子綠短衫，騎在　背上，得得地從街上經過，吸引着外來的遊客凝視，誰的心裏都有一種新奇的感覺，山海關的風俗還停留在十八世紀時代，古色古香，別有一番趣味。</p>
<p>出東門不久，便述遠地望見「天下第一關」五個大字，字的下面就是，蔣主席的肖像，繪得太胖了，使人一見就要發笑。</p>
<p>環抱着這座關樓的是我國歷史上有名的萬里長城。爬上城牆，那蜿蜒曲折，係一條巨蟒似的伸展到天外的長城，實在太偉大了！回想當年秦始皇，爲的要鞏固自己世世代代的皇位，不惜犧牲全國民衆的生命財產來修築「萬里長城，一路上聽到許多人在談孟姜女哭長城的故事，甚至還有人想去城外憑弔姜女廟的，一位中年的男子很感慨地說道：</p>
<p>「可惜我們不知道孟姜女是在什麽地方哭，爲什麼不替她立一個碑做紀念呢？</p>
<p>他們只知道孟姜女哭長城的民間傳說，而且硬說是在靠近山海關這一段哭的，所以離城外十餘里的地方，修有一座姜女廟，至今香火很旺。求兒女，求財富的人們，每到過年過節，便男女女成羣結隊地去燒香朝拜，但近來爲了時局的關係，很少有人去　險了</p>
<p>我站在最高的城　上，遠眺着起伏的山巒，好一個險要的所在阿，關的南面是一望無垠的渤海，那洶湧澎湃的波濤，恰係千兵萬馬在縱動，北面是險峻的角山，仔細望去，似乎每一座山，每一塊大石頭，都有虎踞亂蟠的形勢，重重疊疊的山，做了山海關的屛幛，也像一排排一列列的隊伍在站山岡，這樣一個形勢險要的地方，怪不得自古以來就爲兵家必爭之地，雖然「天下第一關」的題字很多，但這兒却是真正的第一關，而且那形勢，的確有「一夫當關，萬夫莫敵」之險。</p>
<p>凉風一陣陣吹來，四顧寥闊，使我憶起了一段古事來。</p>
<p>在武漢住過的人，都知道武昌有一條馬路叫做熊廷弼路，而很少有人知道他就是明朝有名的文將，當他在山海關做遼東經略使的時候，他守禦嚴密，淸兵幾次來犯都不得逞，後來皇上因爲聽了小人的讒言，就把熊廷弼罷免；不久，吳三桂奉命鎭守山海關，李自成攻破了北京城，明思宗在煤山縊死樹上，（即今之景山。）吳三桂的父親也被李自成押起來了，要他招降吳三桂，當他的父親着人送信給他的時候，他說：「沒有關係，我去就會釋放我父親的。」但他按兵不動，接着又有人來報吿：「老爺的全家都被抄封了。」吳三桂毫不着急地回答道：「沒有關係，我一去他就會發還的。」仍然按兵不動，及到最後有人來報吿：「陳圓圓被俘了！」這時吳三桂氣的怒髮衝冠，拍案大叫道：</p>
<p>「此仇不報，何以爲人！」於是立刻出兵，名義上是討賊，實際上他是投降了滿淸，去迎接淸兵入關，最可笑的是吳三桂寫給他父親的信中有這樣的句字：「父旣不忠，兒亦不孝。」</p>
<p>像這樣的一個軍人，皇帝縊死，父親被俘，全家被封，都不着急，而獨對一個妓女這樣迷戀，這樣愛護，這樣關心，爲了一個女人而把國家的主權斷送，把全國民衆出賣的軍人，在國法上，他應該接受何種懲罰，不言可知，因此有名的詩人，吳梅村在「圓圓曲」裏譏評吳三桂道：</p>
<p>一鼎湖（指思宗）當日棄人間，破敵收京下玉關（指山海關），痛哭六軍皆縞素，衝冠一怒爲紅顏。一至今誦之，猶有餘恨。</p>
<p>關於「天下第一關」這五個字的來源有好種說法，最初是出自明書家嚴嵩宰相之手，但因爲他是個最壞的奸相，所以把他寫的那塊匾額藏起來了。現在掛着的，是出於蕭顯的手筆，蕭顯是明代能書能文的著名好手，有人說，他的墳墓，就在角山的山麓。</p>
<p>這裏有一個關頭「天下第一關」這　額的故事，非常有趣；</p>
<p>看來一字非常簡單，但寫起來時就不容易，尤其當牠介乎長形的「第」字和方形的「關」字中間，要使分量上配合勻稱，實在不容易。（見圖）</p>
<p>話說有一天，在一家小飯舖門外，忽然來了一個像叫化子一樣的窮人，向飯舖的老掌櫃討飯，老掌櫃看他生的眉淸目秀，像個讀書人，不像乞丐，遂留他在店裏住下來，每天無條件地供給他的吃和住，一連住了好幾天，臨走時，這住不平凡的叫化子，用一張大紙寫了一個有三尺長寬那麽大的「一」字送給老掌櫃，並且說：</p>
<p>「這就是我報答你的禮物，好好地把牠存起來，將來有一天會有大用的。」</p>
<p>說完話，這窮人忽然不見了，後來康熙皇帝到關上巡幸，看見這地勢的險要，因而贊賞道：</p>
<p>「好一個依山傍海的險要形勢，眞是天下第一關。」</p>
<p>因此立刻下令大臣寫一塊「天下第一關」的匾額，但是無論誰寫，天·下·第·關四個字都寫得好，祗有這「一」字永遠配不好，不是筆劃太長，便是太短，不是太粗，便是太細，於是皇上又下詔旨，誰能配上這個「一」字，就賞銀多少兩，這時那飯鋪的老掌櫃迎忙把叫化子交給他的那個「一」字呈上去，拿來和那四個字一試，果然非常合式，當下得了重賞，因此他便發了大財，不再開飯店了。</p>
<p>這雖然是一個神話式的傳說，但住在山海關過了四十以上的人，誰都知道這個故事，尤其那位替我照相的老頭兒，更說得津津有味，有聲有色。</p>
<p>在城牆上散步了很久，循着原路回來，忽然看見一塊倒了的石碑，上面刻着「忠勇義烈」四個大字，旁邊還有一行小字是「故警長半澤良知戰死之地」一看，我知道這兒曾經不知經過多少次血戰，殺死了多少敵人，犧牲了多少我們弟兄們的血肉。有人在「良知」的旁邊寫下「王八」兩個大字，看的人都覺得痛快，這不知是一種什麽心理，無以名之，我只好名之曰「阿Ｑ」的心理勝利。</p>
<h3 id="c139">自由與枷鎖 <a href="#c139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>— 叔孫如瑩</p>
<p>從法國大革命以來，自由這名詞被便叫得震天價響。在藝術的領域里，自由也是被視同塊寳而爲藝術家們所崇奉服膺的。藝術創作的自由，不論在內容上抑形式上，都一樣地重要。任何思想的壓抑，限制，以及對藝術形式的的束，都是藝術創作的枷鎖，不能爲藝術家所接受。</p>
<p>爲了崇尙自由，於是枷鎖便遭擊碎·「三」律」，「自然主義」，以及一切限制作家思想與表現方法的規律，都在滬原因之下被推翻，被黜棄了。創作家推開理論的範圍，走向更新的領域，便是藝術的進步。而這進步，正是自由的勝利，也是藝術家的勝利。</p>
<p>其實，今日的枷鎖在常初　本不是枷鎖，它無碍於自由，或反而有助於自由。當古典主義盛興蓬勃之日，「三一律」會給羅馬的作家以極大的帮助與指示，但當時代前進了，而古典主義的規律不能有更新的變革時，於是它便成爲阻碍藝術發展的枷鎖，終於從被人崇敬的寳座上推下來，跌得粉碎。</p>
<p>即使是極度崇尙自由的浪漫主義，它終於也變成了枷鎖，而被寫實主義代替了它的地位。在產業革命以後，科學日益發達，以熱情與發展個性爲主張的浪漫主義常然不能再被人崇信，於是逐漸沒落。</p>
<p>總之，藝術的自由常因時代之演變而有異，彼一時代的藝術自由，與此一時代的藝術自由，往往大相逕庭。同樣，限制藝術發展的枷鎖也常常變遷，它也因時代之進步而有變化。枷鎖不常爲枷鎖，自由不常爲自由，但要看藝術理論的內容是否與時代精神相合而已。</p>
<p>藝術品因材料，創作方法等的不同，而有各種型款。藝術品由材料與創作方法等所產生，但同時，也就受了材料與創作方法的限制。這限制，在作家看來，有時認爲也是一種枷鎖，使他們失去了自由。對於這限制的掙扎，會有兩種結果：（一）尋求新的創作方法或新的材料，而成爲另一型類的藝術。（二）要衝出限制，但終於被局限於限制中，而使藝術的統一性遭受損失，致影響到作品的價値。</p>
<p>這裏，便是認錯了自由與枷鎖的意義。</p>
<p>譬如木刻，它因材料（木板）與工具（木刻刀）的限制，而有了它的特質，它粗擴，有力，明顯，有着强烈的對比，這也便是木刻藝術的獨特的美。又如戲劇，必須在觀衆，演員，舞台等三種限制下來創作，失去其一便不復是戲劇。這些限制決不是枷鎖，而且，在這限制中儘有着無限的自由。一枝木炭，一張白紙的限制下，畫家能表現出無窮的構圖，無窮的情趣來。一堆泥土，在雕塑家的手中可以變幻無窮，顯示千萬種雄奇秀美的形體。</p>
<p>在限制中去尋求無限，在「枷鎖」中去尋求自由，對於一個藝術家是必要的修養。</p>
<p>要認淸什麽是局限，什麽是枷鎖；什麽是自由，什麽是放蕩，又覺僅藝術家爲然？</p>
<p>舊俄時代的大作家果戈里，在他的一封信中說：「假如我去做戲子，我還可以有保障…但是我是一個作家，因此就得餓死。」</p>
<p>批評家伊斯瑪洛夫說：「作家的妻子！是一個廚娘，洗衣婦，和洗碗碟者，僅有一點不同，就是不取酬報。假如上帝給了她們幾個孩子，那她們更是受難者了，終日默想，終日不安；明天拿什麼東西給孩子們吃呢？」</p>
<p>嚴寒凍紅的鼻子的作者，俄國平民詩人湼克拉梭夫說：「作家的命運，是大家都知道的命運；悲慘的一生，不雅的尊稱；在半飢半餓底孤獨中了結這一生…」。他又說：「整整的三個年頭，我沒有一天不是挨餓的，在大飯店裏常常有人進去看報，並不叫什麽吃；我也常常如此做。當我看報的時候，我就順便把旁邊的麵包盤拿過來，把麵包吃了。—這便是我唯一的食糧」。</p>

<p>現代作家魯彥先生，不死於災難，不毀於烽火，而也是死於貧困的生活中。</p>
<p>近來友人吿訴我，作家們生活的艱苦情况，眞不禁爲之鼻酸。聽說目下居住上海的××先生，近來爲了生活費用的難於張羅。竟將他太太的金飾兌了救急。堂堂皇皇的老作家們，生活竟如此凄凉，如此狼狽，我眞懷疑以後的文學史是否還能繼續寫下去？但是翻翻往昔的關於作家們的生活，結果我發覺也是一樣的慘淡，而他們在艱苦中，却更給後人點燃起先知的明燈，照引着廣大的人羣於是我想：這該是眞眞愛人類的人。他們默默地爲了人羣而犧性一切；爲了人羣而遺忘了自己！</p>

<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>二十六的黎明到了。我們從上午八點起，就在緊張的情緒下，守候消息。我們要看看日人究竟用什麽方式發動這個「三部曲」陰謀？九點。九點半。十點。仍舊沒有消息來。我正想打電話給Ｗ君，問問情形，那送信給鼎元的人忽然跑了進來。我奇怪他爲什麽耽擱了這多時候。原來鼎元已經病了幾天了，是每年一度的阿米巴下痢，外帶一點神經衰弱。剛巧有點起色，早晨睡得很好，所以送信的人，待在那裏守候回信。鼎元要我立刻去看。他</p>
<p>好在路局的廠房離我們這裏，只有幾分鐘路程，我把事情交給〇四號，又倣照「空谷傳聲」，佈置了一個　信方式，用三個人；一個站在本宅前的山埂坡上，一個站在上路局拐角的所在，一個在鼎元住宅不遠的地點。只要消息一到，第一人給第二人一個手式，第二人轉給第三人，這樣，最多一二秒鐘，我就可以得到信息。</p>
<p>我因知道日人這次大舉進攻，目的必在消滅第二十九軍，長辛店是個要衝，絕對免不了遭划，所以我也必得讓鼎元知道一點，讓他作個準備。至於長辛店全鎭的男女老小，限前實無辦法，只看臨時有沒有一些解救的方法。</p>
<p>鼎元住在工廠裏一所小屋子內，爲了面子關係，他不大鞦迎來賓。連我這樣的朋友，也僅僅只去過一次，這回設非病倒了床，絕對不會讓我光臨的。</p>
<p>僅僅幾天不見面，他消瘦了不少，面色十分難看，據說下痢，用灈方法，已經止住；現在就是無端的焦躁，連連失眠，這是憂慮過分，影響了神經系，我必得來見他一見，就是看他能否起床走動；因爲我已經替他打算了一去處—成都，成都大學。</p>
<p>我把我的計劃，委宛地吿訴了他，關於路上用度盤川等項，因爲他老是一派英國紳士作風，不能說資助的話，免得傷了他的「自尊精神」，僅僅說我有一點不動的款子，預備匯給一個成都朋友，託他買點東西，假使盤川短少的話，可以先用，只要在一年內歸還，加上些銀行相等的利息就行了，總共不過千多塊錢，在我這光杆兒看，毫無所謂，難道還要斤斤較量，問他要什麼利息？無奈不這麼辦，必定遭他拒絕。</p>
<p>我說了這話，正要注意他的反應，誰知我這片心思，完全白費，他身體衰弱，不大能多說話，他的太太，那位賢　的夫人，替他說明了他的計劃。</p>
<p>以前他不是想遷家避難嗎？後來聽見我說這一次「事變」並非局部性質，是全面戰事的局面，他忽然改了計劃；預備參加軍隊，擔任電訊工作。這是就一技之長，替國家盡一份子力量的辦法。太太和梅君，如若可能的話，連閘君在內，願意參加軍隊病院的看護工作。兩個男孩子士仁，士義，由他自己帶着學習通訊技術，竹君當然由母親姐姐們帶着，希望最好能在一個軍團之內工作，免得全家分離。</p>
<p>「祇要能够起床，我就要去投効了」！」他很興奮的吿訴我。</p>

<p>— 彌山</p>
<p>歷年來上海的氣候，反常的時候多，正常的時候少，今年的天氣更是作怪；乍冷乍熱，變幻無常。過了中秋節，還是驕陽逼人，秋行夏令。但一陣雨，却從盛暑，一跳跳到了深秋。六月裏徐家匯天文台還發表過「今年無夏季」，誰知夏季特別延長，倒變成了一今年無初秋一。</p>
<p>把歷年上海氣象報吿翻開來，先從最熱的一年算起：</p>
<p>是年爲民國二十三年，最高溫度達一〇四·四度，打破六十三年的紀錄。</p>
<p>民國二十四年，最高溫度爲一〇〇·八度。</p>
<p>民國二十五年，最高溫度爲九七·二度</p>
<p>民國二十六年，最高溫度爲九九·九度。</p>
<p>民國二十七年，最高溫度爲九八度。</p>
<p>民國二十八年，最高溫度爲九九·一度。</p>
<p>民國二十九年，最高溫度爲九九度。</p>
<p>民國三十年，最高溫度爲九八·四度。</p>
<p>民國三十一年，最高溫度爲一〇三。六度。</p>
<p>民國三十二年，最高溫度爲九八·四度·</p>
<p>民國三十三年，最高溫度爲一〇二·七度</p>
<p>民國三十四年，即去年，最高溫度爲一〇〇度。</p>
<p>本年度的最高溫度是一〇一度，比起上列各年的最高溫度，似乎還沒有什麼了不得，但是到了九月，熱度重又高漲，最高竟達一百度；比起民國二十六年同月最高溫度九九·九度，高過了〇·一度，造成七十三年以來的最高紀錄。</p>
<p>幾陣雨，好容易把秋老虎送走了，但據本市天文台的報吿，這兩天天氣就要轉熱，究竟如何！瞧着吧</p>

<h3 id="c146">是投資·非投機　談證券交易所 <a href="#c146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>— 彌陀</p>
<p>證券交易所在本月九日開幕，經過了一星期的演習交易和對賬手續，已在十六日正式開拍了。</p>
<p>中國有證券交易所，歷史甚暫。以前我國商業組織，都由個人獨資經營，或數人合資，根本沒有股份有限公司的組織。在淸代有一二爿店號代理外埠股票交易，當時的買主，以買辦階級爲多。後來股票發行增多，交易日盛，光緒十七年有「洋商股票掮客公會」出現，在光緒三十一年，改爲「衆業公所」。</p>
<p>民國三年，華商股票商業公會成立，所做股票交易，有中國銀行，交通銀行，商務，中華，招商，漢冶　等二十餘種。到民國九年，擴充爲「上海華商證券交易所」，才是中國第一個正式的證券市塲，距倫敦第一個證券交易所的成立，相　一百四十七年。當時資金爲三百萬元，開拍公司股票，抗戰時停辦。</p>
<p>戰時的上海，一般商人紛紛創立新興車業，從事投機。三十二年股票公司達二百數十家，造成市塲的紊亂，僞政府當局也看得太不像話，下令取締，但不久就有三四十家「合法復業」。同時偽「證券交易所」也開拍了，其中內幕烏烟瘴氣，不堪聞問。</p>
<p>中國的股票交易，是素以上海爲總樞的。除了上海以外，只有平津和武漢了·北平的證券交易所在民國七年早就成立，津漢似乎還沒有交易所的設置。</p>
<p>交易所原是徹頭徹尾法治的經濟組織，其作用能　導游資，又能扶　工商，但是　容易被投機家所利用，買空賣空，　　市價，助長賭博風氣，搖動市面安全，誠如吳國楨先生所說：「交易所倘能辦好，可能協助政府。穩定金融，安定民生，否則金融民生均受其影響，」在今日工商業不景氣、金融還不十分安定的時候，對今後證券交易所的發展，大家都予以與　　關切！</p>
<p>於此得重申我們的希望：</p>
<p>「希望證券交易所成爲一個投資市塲，而不是一個投機市塲！」</p>

<p>我輩小學敎師自命不凡，着實書卷氣太重。十多年前一個高足於日前把晤，他已經全部美式配備。他勸我改行，帮他忙走洋行的路，凡心幾乎一動，總算君子自重，婉詞謝絕。吿訴了老婆，捱得一頓臭駡，駡聲中雜着我的唸詞，曰：「學問之這無他，求其放心而已矣」，不防老婆抽了一口冷氣，她道：「惟老人與士大夫，爲難養者也」！摸摸下巴上的鬍髭，沒有話說。</p>
<p>老同事冉熙來談，他估計我的主任薪大約至少在五十萬以上；當我吿訴他廿三萬幾撇的時候，他的面都表悄不是我笨拙的筆尖可以畫得出來，總之一句在他認爲是一個奇跡。他說自己塗一張水彩畫寥寥數筆可以抵得過市小一月的薪金。這一氣我險乎暈將下來，對老朋友吐了我最後一句：「呵呵，哈哈！尼采說得好：「這是一切該重新估價的時代……一下意識地浮上了一絲自傲的苦笑。</p>

<h3 id="c150">年靑的上將陳誠 <a href="#c150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>— 重征</p>
<p>在中國，以及全世界，以四十八歲的年齡，身爲一級上將的僅有陳誠將軍一人。因此，中外人士，都認爲他是一個少壯軍人。典型的靑年將領。</p>
<p>一八九九年，浙江最小的縣城——靑田，一個農村老學究的家裏，誕生了一個小天使，就是現任國防部參謀總長陳誠將軍。</p>
<p>刻苦與勤學，是他唯一的本色，幼時的他，讀書極用功，直到保定畢業，任黃埔第一期區隊長時，亦復如此，記得有一天早晨，天還未亮，他帶着一本書到操塲上練器械操，做健身運動，因爲急於先行跑步，把書暫時去在地下；那時，蔣校長恰巧到操塲去散步，發覺遠遠的草地上有一本書，蔣氏很奇怪，想在書上找名字，但是東方未明，看不出。正在猜測的時候，又發現了一個黑的影子在蠕動，蔣校長即刻發問：「誰！）他答：「我是陳誠。」蔣氏因此知道那一本書一定又是他的了，心裏默默的想，這一位年靑的區隊長居然能刻苦勤學求進，頗値得嘉許，於是，在全校官生舉行升旗典禮以後，特別將陳誠嘉獎了一番，說他是全校官生的模範。不久，他被調出校外，任職營長。從此，他得了將校長的信任與賞識。廿多年來，蔣氏總是很器重他。他也極敬仰校長。</p>
<p>卅一年，蔣委員長曾訪問印度，成行以前，陳誠還在湖北前綫國他對於蔣氏印度之行，深爲不滿，曾上一電呈述意見，但蔣委員長並未採納。等蔣氏由印度回到重慶，他特地從戰時的湖北省會恩施趕到重慶，又面述前次他的意思。這雖然是小事，可是却表現他是多麽眞誠。</p>
<p>當第一次長沙會戰時，他以第六戰區司令兼第九戰區司令的身份，在前綫指揮，任憑敵人的飛機不斷的轟炸與掃射，却毫無畏懼之色，仍泰然處之，保持鎭靜。有一次，敵機數十架不斷在上空盤旋，雪片似的槍彈向地面掃射，他的衛士都嚇得臥倒在壕溝裏，他仍然不動聲色的注意敵機的行動，有一個胆小的衛士，担心司令長官的安全，大呼「司令長官臥下！」他帶部下，恩威並施，這也許是他成功的要訣。有一次，一個師長苦守某一個陣地，損失慘重；但他的命令要那師長維持到某一個時間才退，面那個師長竟到了最後一剎那，（距命令撤退的時間僅二十分鐘）忍耐不住而退出陣地；結果，陳誠毫不猶疑的把師長槍決了。還有一次，當他任職湖北主席時，某廳長小舅子，管理公糧，侵吞公款，被人吿發舞弊，他也絲毫不留情面把那舞弊者槍斃了。據說，他執政湖北時，只要有一點貪汚，不管事體大小，絕對正法。在另一方面他很關懷部下，愛戴部下，每每在前綫戰鬥混亂之中，許多官兵（包括負傷的與未負傷的）因戰鬥關係與都隊失去了連絡，祇要給他看到或知道了，立刻會發一筆救濟費。</p>
<p>他是砲兵出身，因爲他的成名，許多人歌頌砲兵的偉大。有些人說，蔣主席，拿破崙，段祺瑞，陳誠以及許許多多中外的名將，都是砲兵出身；於是大家不約而同的在部隊中流傳一種佳話：「砲兵至上」。其實，砲兵也沒有什麼了不起地方，只不過因爲學砲兵的主要要求是數學（三角幾何微積分大代數等）根基要好；否則，在射擊的學理上與實際射擊的時候，會感到很大的困難，而數學好的人，腦子是比較科學一點。</p>
<p>陳誠一向胃腸不好，腸潰瘍的病一度很危險，後來接着十二指腸出血，普通食物不能進，只飲些流質的食品。但在他就任國防部參謀總長時以到現在，健康是漸漸恢復了。他上台的第一件事，是在南京取締吉普戴女郞。這一命令，在事實上確有需要，但在理論上，却對於婦女的地位確有些不利。因此命令未行，而女同胞們却在報上寫文章說長話短了。陳誠，中國的少壯將領，我們感謝他對於抗戰的努力，祝福他永遠康樂！</p>

<p>[Dispatch from Xuzhou by Central News Agency, 22nd] The National Army recovered the county seat of Huai'an (southeast of Huaiyin) on the morning of the 22nd. [Another dispatch] The Communist army led by Xu Xiangqian, retreating from Huaiyin, deployed defenses in Huai'an, southeast of Huaiyin, and launched sneak attacks on the National Army. On the 21st, after being counterattacked by the National Army, they were forced to the outskirts of Huai'an, and after several hours of fierce fighting, the National Army finally broke into the city. The Communist army fought from street corners, and on the morning of the 22nd, the Communist army, unable to withstand the pressure, collapsed and retreated. The city was then recovered by the National Army.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from Zhenjiang by this newspaper, 22nd] According to official sources, after the National Army recovered Huaiyin, the remaining Communist troops retreated eastward and southeastward in two routes. The National Army took advantage of the victory to pursue them, and the fall of Lianshui is imminent. Another unit has already advanced to Cheqiao Town, east of Huai'an, where more than 20,000 Communist troops are relying on the undulating terrain of the paddy fields to put up a stubborn resistance. It is also reported that the Communist army is transferring troops from the Yancheng and Funing area to reinforce the town in a final struggle.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from Taizhou by this newspaper, 22nd] Since the recovery of Huaiyin and the opening of the Hai'an line, the Communist army in northern Jiangsu feels that their end is near. Senior Communist generals have been holding emergency meetings in Gaoyou and Ninghai for days, planning everything. According to sources familiar with the situation on the eastern front in northern Jiangsu, no large-scale battles have occurred due to the rapid advance of the National Army. However, a major battle is brewing and may break out on the western front. The fate of the Communist army in northern Jiangsu was initially decided in Huaiyin, and Shaobo will be the second point of contention. At this moment, this small town on the bank of the Grand Canal has become the biggest target for both sides. Furthermore, after the recovery of Qutang and Baimi, the local party and government leaders personally went to comfort the residents, and order in the two areas is gradually stabilizing.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from Taizhou by this newspaper, 22nd] The Communist army that attacked Dongchengzhuang in Tongzhen was met with a head-on attack by our reinforcing troops, and they have now retreated north.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from Nanjing by this newspaper, 22nd] The Chinese Communist Party acknowledged on the 22nd that the Communist army withdrew from Huaiyin at 2:30 PM on the 19th.</p>

<p>[Dispatch from Nanjing by this newspaper, 22nd] As the National Army advances towards Zhangjiakou, it is rumored that the Communist side, due to insufficient troop strength, is preparing to withdraw. According to a dispatch from Zhangjiakou by the New China News Agency on the 21st, a joint command has been established in the city. [Dispatch from Beiping by this newspaper, 22nd] There is still no news of contact on the Ping-Sui Railway front today, but it is reported that the air force launched a large-scale operation today. Although today is Sunday, Commander Sun Yunzhong still went to the commander's headquarters to work and consulted with Chief of Staff Song Kentang several times. However, there were fewer staff members in the commander's headquarters than usual, and there was no excessive tension, which seemed to indicate that the Ping-Sui front had not yet entered a state of combat. Today's intelligence from Huai'an indicates that 3,000 to 4,000 people have infiltrated the vicinity of Shunyi.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from Beiping by this newspaper, 22nd] The Communist army east of Zhangjiakou has built three lines of defense: the first line is Kangzhuang, the second line is Huailai, and the third line is between Xiahuayuan and Xuanhua.</p>

According to reports from the front, the damage is most severe between Suji and Guancun, and between Gushan and Datong. The employees in the western section have been working hard day and night for half a month, and there is a shortage of materials, so it is feared that the railway will not be open to traffic by the end of the month.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from Tianjin by this newspaper, 22nd] More than 10,000 Communist troops recently infiltrated the Liuzhongwang area, 7 kilometers northeast of Gaobeidian on the Ping-Han Railway, attempting to sabotage the railway.</p>

<p>Soviet Union Denies Supplying the Chinese Communist Army</p>
<p>[Dispatch from Washington by United Press, 21st] Members of the House Military Committee, who recently returned from a tour of the Far East, stated today: The Soviet Union wants to control China and is trying to force the United States to abandon its role as a mediator in China. They believe that the Soviet Union secretly supports the Chinese Communist army and encourages Communist leaders to sabotage the ceasefire agreement and the tripartite joint adjudication military mediation department in Beiping. The committee members said: If Marshall's efforts to end the Chinese civil war fail, the differences between the US and the Soviet Union on the China issue may become extreme. Marshall is undertaking an extremely difficult task with limited resources, and the success or failure of his mission will be determined in the near future. They also said that some people in various parts of the Far East hope that the United States will stop its mediation efforts and let the two sides fight to the finish, but others believe that the United States is already deeply involved and cannot easily withdraw. [Dispatch from Moscow by Agence France-Presse, 22nd] Chinese newspapers reported that when warships of the Chinese Second Fleet were patrolling between Lushun and the Shandong Peninsula, they detained several illegal vessels flying Soviet flags and carrying military supplies to the Communist army in Yantai and Weihaiwei. This claim has been denied by TASS, which stated that it is completely unfounded.</p>

<h3 id="e11">Wang Bingnan Visits Special Envoy Marshall Yesterday; Submits Memorandum from the Chinese Communist Party; Requests the Opening of a Military Tripartite Meeting Again <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>[Dispatch from Nanjing by this newspaper, 22nd] A large part of the conclusions as to whether there will be progress in the future situation can be obtained today, because the Communist Party submitted a second memorandum to Special Envoy Marshall today, insisting on convening a military tripartite meeting, arguing that the war situation is serious, and has expressed a firm attitude. Two days ago, Special Envoy Marshall had submitted a mediation opinion to Wang Bingnan, the content of which was to convene an informal five-person group meeting to discuss the reorganization of the National Government Committee, and after achieving success, to discuss a ceasefire. This opinion was often consulted with Zhou Enlai by Wang Bingnan, and today he received instructions from Zhou and gave a reply to Special Envoy Marshall, which was to refuse to attend the five-person meeting. When Special Envoy Marshall met Wang Bingnan, he made some suggestions to Wang and said that he would seek the opinion of the government representatives. In today's conversation, Wang Bingnan mentioned the Communist Party's request to publish the entire record of the talks, and Special Envoy Marshall also said that he needed to discuss it with the government representatives before making a decision. This afternoon, reporters interviewed Wang Bingnan, and Wang said: This is the Communist Party's last request, and the situation has reached a critical juncture. The reporter asked if the government also maintained the same resolute attitude as the Communist Party and insisted on convening a five-person meeting, the situation would be unimaginable, and whether the Communist Party had any further measures. Wang replied that he had to wait for Zhou Enlai to express his views, because Wang had already conveyed the opinions expressed orally by Marshall today to Shanghai.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from Nanjing by this newspaper] The content of the first memorandum submitted by the Communist Party on the 17th was to appeal for a ceasefire and request a military tripartite meeting. The second memorandum was submitted on the 22nd, with largely the same content. Wang Bingnan submitted it to Special Envoy Marshall at 10:00 AM. After Marshall and Wang met for an hour, the former left and went to the US Embassy to orally inform Ambassador Stuart of the content of the memorandum. After Wang left, the ambassador discussed it with his personal consultant, Fu Jingbo, who then visited Wu Tiecheng and Zhang Lisheng at 12:30 PM, presumably to convey this opinion. Today, reporters repeatedly visited these gentlemen, but the doormen of their residences all said that they were "out." When we inquired by telephone at 12:00 PM, we were told that they were very busy today and were not at home, and were already asleep. The reporter speculates that all parties may have had some consultations or are looking for a proper way to save the crisis.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from Nanjing by this newspaper, 22nd] In addition to receiving Wang Bingnan in the morning, Ambassador Stuart went to church with Fu Jingbo at 5:00 PM and then Special Envoy Marshall visited the embassy, where they watched a movie in the guest room and enjoyed the holiday.</p>

<p>[Dispatch from Nanjing by this newspaper, 22nd] Yesterday morning, the reporter visited Secretary-General Shao Lizi, who, with a relaxed expression, was sorting through long-accumulated letters and documents and said that on this trip back to his hometown, he was able to see the sea tide that he had been away from for ten years. Mrs. Shao said: The crowds are even more turbulent than the sea tide, which shows how many people are watching the tide. Mr. Shao will go to Shanghai and Hangzhou again in half a month and will attend the Fudan University anniversary. When reporters asked Mr. Shao about the overall political situation, he said, "Now I can relax." and avoided answering.</p>

<p>Never Mentioned Opening a Comprehensive Sub-Committee Meeting</p>
<p>[Dispatch from Nanjing by this newspaper, 22nd] During the stalled negotiation period, there have been rumors that the government proposed convening a comprehensive sub-committee meeting of the Political Consultative Conference. Liang Shuming, the secretary-general of the Democratic League, told reporters from this newspaper yesterday that Wu Dingchang and Lei Zhen from the government had made this statement to Zhang Junmai. However, based on observations from all parties, it is generally believed that there is no possibility of convening a comprehensive sub-committee meeting at present. On the morning of the 22nd, the reporter specially visited Wu Dingchang, the Secretary-General of the Civil Service, to ask for an explanation on this matter. According to Wu, he went to Shanghai on the 9th. On the morning of the 10th, at the airport to see off Chairman Zhang Qun, he met Wu Tiecheng, Zhang Junmai, and others. After Zhang Qun took off, he went to Wu Tiecheng's residence with Zhang Junmai for a brief sit-down, during which they generally discussed the current situation and expressed the hope that the five-person group meeting could be convened as soon as possible. He never mentioned the comprehensive sub-committee. Zhang then visited him on the 15th, but they did not meet because of other guests. He returned the visit on the 16th, and the discussion was still as described above. As for inviting him to Beijing, it was only a personal suggestion and did not represent the government. Wu expressed great surprise at all kinds of rumors. Subsequently, the reporter visited Lei Zhen, the Deputy Secretary-General, to ask for an explanation of his mission to Shanghai. Lei said: His visit to Shanghai was not solely to meet with representatives of the Democratic League, but also for other official duties. As for what was discussed with Zhang Junmai, it never involved the comprehensive sub-committee. He also told reporters that he planned to visit Liang Shuming on the 23rd to ask about some matters.</p>

<h3 id="e18">Chairman in Nanchang; Pays Respects at the Martyrs' Cemetery and Inspects the Officers' Corps; Welcome Meeting in Gan'an Rescheduled for This Morning <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>[Dispatch from Nanchang by this newspaper, 22nd] After Chairman Chiang arrived in Nanchang yesterday, he only met with Chen Zhaoying, Wang Lingji, Hu Jing'an and a few others that evening, inquiring about the recent party and government affairs in Jiangxi Province and the educational affairs of the Provincial Cadre Training Corps. Because the war disaster in Jiangxi Province was severe and the New Life Movement still needed efforts, the Chairman told Chen Zhaoying and Wang Lingji that he would not attend any banquets or see any plays for the time being. After strolling around the command headquarters for a moment around 9:00 PM, he still wrote in his diary as usual and silently read a few pages of scripture before going to bed. In addition, Madame Chiang spoke with the Chairman by phone from Shanghai last night and wished each other good night. The Chairman rose at dawn today, lightly dressed, wearing a khaki wool Zhongshan suit. At 9:00 AM, Chen Rongying came to visit, and the Chairman changed into military uniform and drove to the Qingyun Martyrs' Cemetery at 9:45 AM, and inspected the Sixth Officers' Corps of the Central Training Corps. Aide-de-camp Shi Juemin and Secretary Cao Shengfen followed in another car. Wang Lingji, the Chairman of the Jiangxi Provincial Government, and Chen Pei, the commander of the Sixth Officers' Corps, had been waiting in front of the tomb one hour earlier. After the Chairman arrived, he got out of the car and slowly walked up the tomb path, first bowing to the memorial tower, and silently paying respects for three minutes. Later, he saw the dilapidated archway and was saddened for a long time, often looking back at the people accompanying him and instructing them to repair it properly. The Chairman lingered at the Martyrs' Cemetery for a long time, and also went to the graves of the martyrs who died in the Northern Expedition and General Hu Zuyu, who died suppressing bandits, and Cheng Maoxing, the good grain official who died for grain, to silently pay respects for a moment.</p>
<p>After paying respects at the Martyrs' Cemetery, the Chairman then went to the flagpole in front of the first battalion of the Officers' Corps to inspect the more than 900 demobilized officers who were receiving short-term training in the corps and about to be transferred to other jobs. The Chairman examined the appearance, complexion, clothing, and even leggings of each officer in great detail. Seeing that the officers' clothing was neat and their spirits were strong, he repeatedly said "Good", "Good". After the inspection, the Chairman stepped into the classrooms and officers' dormitories on the upper floor of the battalion headquarters, as well as the kitchen, toilet, and vegetable garden outside the corps headquarters, inspecting them one by one, inquiring in great detail about the corps' food, nutrition, and miscellaneous affairs, and giving instructions.

It is said that the Chairman did not bring luggage on this trip to the province, and the provincial government temporarily made quilts and mattresses, one each. The mattress makers were reportedly to supply the Chairman's use, worked happily, and firmly refused payment, which fully demonstrates the enthusiasm of the Jiangxi compatriots for loving and supporting the head of state.</p>

<p>[Dispatch from Singapore by Central News Agency, 20th] The 20,000 overseas Chinese in Bagan, on the east coast of Sumatra, are now in the most dangerous situation. If the Dutch and Allied forces fail to provide timely assistance, they will all be eliminated by Indonesians. According to a report from representatives of the local overseas Chinese to our Consul General in Singapore, hundreds of armed Indonesians invaded Bagan from neighboring islands on September 14th, and some overseas Chinese were killed. On the 19th, they launched an organized attack on the overseas Chinese, who put up an effective resistance. As a result, both sides suffered 20 casualties each. The overseas Chinese are running out of ammunition and are deeply afraid that the Indonesians will retaliate. Jiang Jiadong, the Consul General in Batavia, notified Keiran, the British High Commissioner for Southeast Asia, today and requested British assistance. At the same time, Keiran ordered the British Consulate in Batavia to ask the Dutch and Allied authorities to deal with this matter and ordered them to first evacuate 8,000 women and children. Although Bagan is under Dutch control, there are very few troops stationed there, so it is very vulnerable to attacks.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency Singapore, 21st] The Dutch Consulate in Singapore announced last night that all ships and goods detained in Muntok would soon be released, and the Muntok incident would be resolved satisfactorily.

However, representatives from the Chinese Importers and Exporters Association informed a Central News Agency reporter that they would likely take the latter course of action, as they feared that proceeds from selling sugar in Muntok might not be remittable to Singapore. Furthermore, the following issues related to this incident remain unresolved: (1) Compensation for our sailors tragically killed by the Dutch Navy on July 7th; (2) Compensation for losses suffered by our compatriots' ships and goods detained in Muntok.

<p>Gu Zhengkang Comforts Refugees in Zhenjiang</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 22nd] Minister of Social Affairs Gu Zhengkang arrived in Zhenjiang on the night of the 21st. At 10:00 AM on the 22nd, he presided over the sixth meeting of the Northern Jiangsu Refugee Relief Conference, which resolved the following important matters: (1) The Executive Yuan originally allocated 5,000 tons of flour for the first batch of relief supplies. The Jiangsu-Nanjing Branch reported that only 3,000 tons had been allocated. It was decided to telegraph President Chiang and Premier Song, requesting that the full 5,000 tons be allocated as originally ordered and on schedule. (2) The Jiangsu-Nanjing Branch will handle relief efforts for Northern Jiangsu refugees in towns along the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway in southern Jiangsu, as well as refugees in Jiangyin, Changshu, Jiading, and Liyang outside the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway. (3) Military progress in Northern Jiangsu has been rapid. It was decided to allocate 200 million yuan in emergency relief funds to the recovered counties in the Huai area. The Jiangsu-Nanjing Branch will also allocate 200 tons of flour and 400 bundles of used clothing from materials being transported to Xuzhou and establish an office in Huaiyin. (4) The Xuzhou office's request for continued emergency relief was retroactively approved, with an additional 40 million yuan allocated, bringing the total to 70 million yuan, as well as 50 million yuan for clothing and bedding for refugee children. An additional 6 million yuan was allocated for emergency relief in Rugao. (5) As the weather is getting colder, straw mats should be distributed to each station based on the actual number of people, and the Jiangsu-Nanjing Branch will distribute winter clothing. (6) The flour distributed in Yangzhou during the first round was often moldy and lumpy, and contained bran, making it inedible. The Jiangsu-Nanjing Branch is requested to report this to the General Administration for prompt improvement and to instruct all stations to immediately stop distributing any moldy flour and have the Branch replace it with edible flour.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Hangzhou, 22nd] The Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, a vital transportation artery in Southeast China, is being actively restored after the victory. It has already been repaired to Zhuji. However, due to a lack of railway materials, the existing equipment can only support service to Yiwu. According to railway officials, this project will take at least until the end of the year to complete. As a result, Jinhua, which prospered during the war, has now declined due to the railway's closure. Regarding highway transportation in the nearby area, the regional commissioner stated that the Zhejiang-Fujian Branch of the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration has provided 50 tons of flour, 20% of which has been used for embankment construction. The entire project is expected to be completed by the end of the year.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Hankou, 21st] The Hunan-Hubei-Jiangxi Investigation Team issued a detailed announcement late last night regarding the investigation into the Wuhan District Secret Goods Materials Committee of Hubei Province's handling of opium and tung oil, and based on investigative findings, made accusations against the personnel involved. The main points are as follows: (1) Opium Reception: The Investigation Team believes that although the opium received by the Committee was publicly burned, significant problems still need to be investigated: (a) Only 123 boxes of opium were burned, 16 boxes short of the original reported quantity. (b) One box of opium had been opened, with about four pounds missing, and five boxes of opium were completely different from the other boxes, indicating obvious infiltration and replacement. (c) There is strong suspicion that Wang Yukun and other handlers embezzled opium. (2) Tung Oil Section: The team found that the original reported quantity was 326 barrels, of which all were clear water, and 37 barrels were mixed with clear water. This was clearly a planned replacement fraud, and since the water and oil were difficult to separate, all 320-plus barrels of tung oil could not be auctioned, effectively becoming waste, causing significant losses to the public. Lu Qitong, Wang Guanghua, Sun Dianfu, and other responsible custodians are difficult to absolve of responsibility. After the team published the investigation into the opium, the responsible parties responded publicly with a self-justifying statement. The team considered that there were attempts to cover up the facts in the self-justification, so it drafted a nearly 10,000-word announcement overnight, marking a major written battle in the midst of the investigation.</p>

Ma and Xu presided over the meeting. Both Ma and Xu delivered earnest speeches, stating that the government's launch of this large-scale anti-banditry operation would focus on politics, with military force only playing a supporting role. County military and political leaders should deeply understand this intention, properly promote appeasement work, and show leniency. After the speeches, discussions began. It was decided to further divide the Yangcheng Lake area into eastern and western zones. Kunshan and Taicang belong to the eastern zone, with Liu Zheng, commander of the Fourth Paratrooper Battalion stationed in Kunshan, appointed commander.

<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 22nd] The sixth annual conference of the Political Examination Society opened grandly in Nanjing at 9:30 AM on the 22nd. Over 300 members attended, as well as ministers and officials from various ministries, including President Dai Chuanxian of the Examination Yuan, Vice President Zhou Zhongyue, Minister of Civil Service Jia Jingde, Minister of Organization Chen Lifu, and Minister of Education Hang Liwu. President Chen Manruo presided over the ceremony and delivered an opening speech, followed by the reading of President Chiang's message. President Dai then delivered a speech, stating that the essence of national construction is to implement the Three Principles of the People with the Five-Power Constitution, integrating the best laws and systems from ancient and modern times, both Chinese and foreign, to build China. The purpose of the examination system is to supplement the shortcomings of the modern electoral system. China has always been a country ruled by law with a personnel system at its center. If we can adopt the strengths of modern countries ruled by law and integrate them with our ancient excellent systems, it will not be difficult to build a modern country ruled by law. However, institution building is not an easy task, and it is difficult to expect it to be accomplished overnight. He recalled that when he was selected to head the Examination Yuan in 1928, he felt that it would take 30 years to complete its work. He hopes that all members will carefully study this system. Minister Chen Lifu then delivered a speech, elaborating on the connection between examination and education and administration, and how to coordinate examination and election. Finally, Vice Minister Hang Liwu and others delivered speeches. The opening ceremony concluded at 12:00 PM. At 1:30 PM, the general assembly resumed, with a moment of silence for members who died in the war. This was followed by the reading of academic papers, most of which were on the study of examination institutions and personnel systems, totaling 68 papers. The report on association affairs and discussion of proposals followed. The most notable proposals were those on establishing a civil service protection system and improving civil service salaries. Finally, the entire assembly stood in solemnity and unanimously resolved to send a telegram of respect to President Chiang and President Dai. The conference closed at 6:00 PM.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Nanjing, 22nd] The message issued by the President of the annual conference of the Chinese Political Examination Society is as follows: "The examination system was clearly defined by the Founding Father in the Outline of National Construction and is one of the five governing powers of the National Government. Since the implementation of various examinations, numerous talented individuals have been selected. All qualified personnel have served in central and local positions and have been able to contribute to their duties. During the War of Resistance, they especially relied on sharing hardships and exerting their effectiveness, which is no less meritorious than fighting on the battlefield. Now that the war has been over for more than a year, and the work of national construction is underway, political reform is even more urgent. Members of the association are distributed throughout the country and are the backbone personnel of various departments. They should understand the current needs, express their loyalty, sharpen their talents and wisdom, and work together to bring the country to a unified and prosperous state. With the National Assembly convening soon, shifting power to the people and entering the justice of civil rights politics, how should we thoroughly implement the examination function and improve the personnel system so that national administration is not affected by political competition, but can seek continuous progress in stability? Members should carefully study this and offer good suggestions. They must not fail the original intention of the Founding Father in establishing this system, nor the expectations of the government in selecting talents through various terms. Let us encourage each other."</p>

<p>[United Press Nanjing, 21st] It has been learned that several American B-29 pilots were forced to land near the northern border of Burma two years ago and are now serving as slaves under savage natives. At least three Americans have recently been discovered in the Lolo tribes of western Sichuan, forced to tend livestock, collect wood, and perform other tasks, with poor treatment. The tribe is located west of Xichang, near Burma, the Indian province of Assam, and Tibet. The area is surrounded by mountains, making it inaccessible to Chinese officials. It is rumored that only a few missionaries are scattered in the area. Many American airmen believe that in 1944, when American B-29 bombers were flying from India to China, several aircraft went missing en route. The crew members parachuted to safety and disappeared. However, the U.S. military mortuary registry has never accounted for these missing persons. [Another Telegram] Ambassador Stuart today confirmed the United Press report, stating that the U.S. Embassy has received a report that American airmen who landed in the remote mountainous areas of western China more than two years ago are still alive and are being forced into slavery by the semi-savage Lolo tribes. One of the most reliable sources is Dr. Gralan, of the Chengdu United University. Dr. Gralan is a researcher of primitive peoples in the remote areas of the Tibetan border and has a great reputation. The American airmen are believed to be crew members of downed B-29s, possibly sold to the Lolo tribes as slaves by opium traffickers. These drug traffickers have considerable influence in the tribal areas. The U.S. Embassy has forwarded the report to the U.S. military authorities for rescue efforts.</p>

<h3 id="e43">Editorial: Sino-British Naval Cooperation <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>Sir Philip Vian, Commander-in-Chief of the British Pacific Fleet, recently arrived at the Nanjing docks aboard the cruiser HMS Belfast for an official visit to our government. He promptly held a cocktail reception on his flagship, entertaining our government officials, and a pleasant time was had by all. The next day, our Minister of National Defense, Bai Chongxi, reciprocated with a banquet. It is also reported that during Sir Vian's stay in Nanjing, our naval and government authorities will discuss the establishment of our new navy with him. This is undoubtedly a sign of amicable relations between China and Britain. We would like to take this opportunity to express our views on the establishment of our new navy and Sino-British cooperation in this area.</p>
<p>Without a navy, there is no national defense. This is the painful lesson we learned during the recent war. Therefore, in the future construction of our national defense, we must not ignore the role of the navy. We have a history of training and managing the establishment of a navy for sixty or seventy years. Before the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-95, we were once a power in East Asia. However, due to political corruption and incompetent leadership, we clung to the old ways and fell behind. After this painful experience, we are finally embarking on a new path to rebuild our navy. The establishment of the Ministry of National Defense has corrected the bad habit of the army and navy operating as separate systems, which has created a new opportunity for the Chinese navy. The newly appointed Vice Commander-in-Chief of the Navy, Lieutenant General Gui Yongqing, although originally from the army, is familiar with the international situation and will certainly be able to establish our new navy under the supervision of Commander-in-Chief Chen Cheng.</p>
<p>Those who understand warfare and modern warfare will not deny the effectiveness of the navy in national defense, even in the age of atomic energy. The navy will not be eliminated by the use of atomic energy, but will instead increase its effectiveness. The main military forces of Japan and Germany were defeated by naval power. Because our navy is backward, and our coastline is so long, we should pay special attention to naval construction in our national defense construction. In the construction of our new navy, we especially need Sino-British cooperation. Everyone knows that Britain is an advanced country in modern naval warfare. China initially devoted itself to naval construction and received British assistance at that time. Now that we are rebuilding our navy, we still need the assistance of our old friend. This is, of course, a matter of great shame for us.</p>
<p>Although Britain is called an old empire, it has made many contributions to modern warfare. During World War I, the British invention of the tank defeated Germany, transforming modern warfare from trench warfare back to mobile warfare, completely changing the pattern of modern warfare. In World War II, the initial British use of radar caused Goering's air force to suffer a crushing defeat. In addition, the British invention of penicillin, although not directly related to the war, was also a very important factor in victory. "Although Zhou was an old state, its mandate was new." Ancient Britain can be proud of this. Speaking of the navy, some British naval equipment may not be as good as others, but the British navy has a glorious tradition and excellent training, all of which our new navy should learn from. It is believed that Sir Philip Vian's visit to China will strengthen Sino-British cooperation, especially in the naval field.</p>
<h3 id="e44">Propaganda for the Withdrawal of U.S. Troops from China <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>Several American people's organizations, such as the New York Committee for Peace and the Committee for a Democratic Far Eastern Policy, have jointly launched a "U.S. Troops Out of China Week." Thirty-five major cities across the country have already begun this propaganda campaign yesterday, which will last until the 28th. Such movements are common in democratic and free America and should not be overemphasized. However, this movement involves Chinese politics, and especially because we do not want misunderstandings and estrangement between the people of China and the United States, we must say a word to these small group of American friends.</p>
<p>The current situation in China is indeed very critical. China was at the forefront of the fight against aggression, persevering for eight years, and finally achieved victory. However, the Chinese Communist Party took advantage of the post-war situation, when order had not yet been restored, to raise troops and create chaos, expand its territory, and attempt to seize power by force, plunging China back into war. In order to complete the task of ending the war and creating peace, the U.S. government decided to temporarily keep U.S. troops in China to assist China in repatriating enemy nationals and prisoners of war, and to promote China's peaceful unification. For the past year, the U.S. government has been pursuing its policy towards China based on this principle, and there has been no change. Recently, a small number of Americans, on the one hand, saw the increasing expansion of the civil war in China, and on the other hand, were deceived by the CCP's propaganda offensive, and successively asked the U.S. military and political authorities to withdraw U.S. troops from China. However, the responsible U.S. authorities remain as firm as ever. For example, Admiral Kirk, commander of the U.S. Seventh Fleet, said in Beiping on the 9th of this month that the only mission of the U.S. Marine Corps stationed in China is to assist China in repatriating enemy nationals and prisoners of war and to establish a peaceful order in China. Once this task is completed, they can withdraw from China and return home. At the same time, Russell, Director of Liaison of the U.S. State Department, replied to the American Peace Committee on the 15th of this month: "The U.S. government has decided that once China's peace is restored and a strong, unified, and democratic China is realized, the U.S. military will withdraw completely and freely. President Truman issued a statement on China policy in December last year, stating that the United States would adopt a non-interference policy towards China. This policy has not changed." The U.S. government's attitude is clear and straightforward, and there is no reason to doubt it.</p>
<p>American public opinion on the China issue can be clearly divided into two factions: one faction believes that the United States has a major responsibility for world peace, and an even greater responsibility for the creation of peace in the Far East, especially for China, and should fulfill its promises made during the war. The American China Policy Association led by Powell, publisher of the "China Weekly Review," can be considered a representative of this faction. The association sent a letter to President Truman on the 8th of this month, requesting that the U.S. government immediately insist that the Soviet Union abandon its political control over all Chinese territories, stating that "The Chinese Communist Party is controlled by Moscow and has no intention of reaching an agreement with Chairman Chiang. They only want to use peace talks to delay time so that they can take the opportunity to consolidate their territory, obtain military equipment from the Soviet Union, train troops in the Northeast, some of whom are Japanese, Koreans, and puppet troops, and try to alienate American sympathy and assistance to Chairman Chiang." The other faction believes that the situation of war in China has become inevitable and cannot be reversed by human effort. For the sake of its own interests, the United States should avoid getting involved in the vortex, so it demands the withdrawal of U.S. troops from China. This faction can be represented by Senators Eiland and Butler, who have repeatedly issued statements demanding the withdrawal of U.S. troops from China. The Boston Post also commented that "U.S. troops should not remain in China after the Japanese troops have been driven out of China. This action not only puts a huge financial burden on us, but also has the risk of getting involved in the vortex of China's civil war." The arguments of this faction are no different from those of the isolationists before the U.S. entered the war, and cannot win the support of the majority of the people.</p>
<p>Although the American people have two different views on the U.S. military's stay in China, they are completely united in their desire for China to achieve peace as soon as possible. Therefore, we must ask: Is the fundamental reason for the endless war in China the U.S. military's stay in China? Once the U.S. military withdraws, can the war in China be stopped immediately? If the answer is positive, then we also agree and will demand that the U.S. military withdraw from China immediately. However, in reality, at this time, the U.S. military's stay in China still has the task of assisting China in repatriating enemy nationals and prisoners of war and restoring peace and order. For the sake of China's peace, and also for the sake of world peace, the United States should implement its established policy towards China. But why is it that a small number of people in the United States do not understand the truth about the Far East and advocate the withdrawal of U.S. troops from China? This must be said to be the result of the CCP's anti-American movement. Because the current U.S. policy towards China recognizes the National Government as the only legitimate government and hopes that China can become a strong, unified, and democratic country, the CCP spares no effort to undermine it, even creating unexpected incidents in an attempt to scare away the United States. Those who understand the truth about China, of course, see very clearly the tricks played by the CCP. But there are still some who are intimidated by the CCP's threats and adopt the style of the past isolationists, taking a passive attitude and advocating the withdrawal of U.S. troops from China. Little do they know that this is exactly what the CCP wants.</p>
<p>In short, we believe that China does need peace and hope that the United States will assist China in achieving peace, at least to prevent the war created by the CCP from expanding further in China. As for the American friends who advocate the withdrawal of U.S. troops from China, because their intention is also to hope for peace in China, regardless of their arguments, we still have the obligation to make them truly understand the political situation in China. Otherwise, their erroneous actions will only further strengthen the CCP's anti-American propaganda offensive, which will not only be detrimental to China's peace, but also harmful to the United States.</p>

<h3 id="e45">Four Foreign Ministers Gather in Paris, Conference to Reopen, Various Difficult Problems to Be Resolved <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] Paris, 22nd Broadcast: British Foreign Secretary Bevin returned to Paris from London on Saturday night. The four major foreign ministers will meet again. Moreover, convening a four-power foreign ministers' meeting is the only way to break the deadlock in the Trieste issue sub-committee.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 21st] The British chief delegate to the Peace Conference, Foreign Secretary Bevin, returned to London half a month ago to attend the round table conference on the Palestine issue. During this period, the four major foreign ministers showed little concern for the progress of the Paris Peace Conference. Even Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov has not appeared for several days, and the Peace Conference has fallen into a standstill. Foreign Secretary Bevin has now returned to Paris for a short stay. Whether the four foreign ministers will meet again has not been officially announced. But judging from the current situation, it seems quite possible. At the last meeting of the four foreign ministers, U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes was represented by Dunn, and Bevin was also represented by Navy Minister Alexander, so it was not possible to effectively discuss various issues. If the four foreign ministers can hold a plenary meeting this time, it will be of great benefit to the resolution of various difficult problems.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 21st] British Foreign Secretary Bevin's plan to go to Paris this weekend was kept secret for security reasons. For the past two weeks, personal protection for Bevin has been extremely tight, as it is not appropriate to allow Jewish extremists to engage in intimidation during the Palestine Conference.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper Report] Paris, 22nd Broadcast: In today's Paris Peace Conference, the British and American groups again clashed seriously with the Soviet group. The Economic Committee discussed the draft treaty with Romania. The two sides had widely divergent opinions. The British and American sides insisted that Romania should compensate for the losses caused to the Allies in full; however, the Soviet Union believed that one-third of the compensation was sufficient, so an agreement could not be reached.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 21st] Among the special measures decided after it was decided that each committee of the Peace Conference must complete its work before October 17, one was that meetings should be held for 12 hours a day, but the Trieste sub-committee decided to limit meetings to five hours a day.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Paris, 21st] The Italian Political and Territorial Committee today passed a proposal jointly submitted by Belgium and the Netherlands, deciding to include in the Italian Treaty the recently concluded Italian-Austrian agreement on guaranteeing the German-speaking residents in South Tyrol have the same rights as Italians. During the discussion, the Slavic group disagreed with the proposal. The Belarusian representative, Kislev, believed that the Italian-Austrian agreement was a domestic affair between the two countries and did not need to be recognized by the Paris Peace Conference. As a result, it was still passed by a vote of thirteen to six. Then, Article 10 of the draft Italian Treaty, concerning the Italian-Austrian guarantee of passenger and freight transportation between North Tyrol and East Tyrol, was passed without difficulty. Article 11 stipulates that Italy cede the islands off the southern coast. The Southern representative, Bebler, requested a clearer provision. The French representative suggested that the matter be referred to a sub-committee for discussion. As a result, the article was also adopted. Then, Article 12, on Italy ceding the Dodecanese Islands to Greece, was discussed. The Greek representative, Politis, argued that the names of the islands should be listed and that it should be explicitly stipulated that the small islands belonging to the group should also be ceded. This was unanimously passed.</p>

The exchange will begin one year after the treaty comes into effect and must be completed within three years. A Hungarian spokesperson said that the agreement was beneficial to Yugoslavia because there were 500,000 Hungarians in Yugoslavia, while there were only 40,000 Yugoslavs in Hungary. It was also learned that the restoration of diplomatic relations between the two countries was also mentioned during the negotiations.</p>

<p>[United Press, New York, 22nd] The strike by U.S. West Coast maritime workers has been going on for 16 days. Today, it was decided to resume work, and the maritime workers' strike seems to have come to an end.

Unless the maritime workers and pilots were "satisfied," they would not resume work, which hindered the resolution of the strike. The union members then sent a letter stating that they agreed to return to work.

<p>[United Press, Tehran, 21st] Government troops, led by tanks and aircraft, advanced on Shiraz today and surrounded the rebellious tribes, who are defending their capital of Fars Province on the Persian Gulf. At the same time, in Kangun County, another part of Iran, the situation is extremely tense. The government troops are not allowed to enter, as the area was transferred to the Tehran authorities by the Azerbaijan government.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Tehran, 21st] Hundreds of members of the Qashqai tribe, riding horses and carrying weapons, invaded the cities of Kazerun and Qir and disarmed the military police before fleeing towards Shiraz. Shiraz is a large city with a population of 129,000 and a strong military force, so it is unlikely to be occupied by them. However, rumors are rife here, and the cabinet has convened an emergency meeting. At the same time, the Iranian army has dispatched several motorized units and five aircraft to Shiraz to increase its defense.</p>
<h3 id="e63">Fifty Years of Blood Debt, Japanese Exploitation of Taiwanese Assets, Numbers Shocking and Difficult to Estimate <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taipei, 22nd] The truth about Japan's exploitation of Taiwan for 50 years has now been preliminarily explained with numbers. The total value of Japanese public and private assets received by our country in Taiwan is 3,139,500,000 yen, while the total amount of debt owed by the Japanese in Taiwan is 4,400,800,000 yen. After offsetting the assets and liabilities, there is still a debt of 1,268,500,000 yen. However, this number is still only a small part of the total amount of Japan's exploitation of Taiwan. During the past half century, Japanese imperialists invaded Taiwan and implemented a colonial policy. The total amount of exploitation, if all the numbers could be obtained, would be extremely shocking. It is currently impossible to obtain this accurate number, and it is expected that the day when this shocking historical number can be obtained will never come.</p>

<h3 id="e68">The Rift Between the Soviet Union and Western Countries is Obvious, the European Federation is Difficult to Achieve, British and French Celebrities Propose Concrete Plans <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>[Associated Press, New York, 21st] After former British Prime Minister Churchill recently gave a speech in Zurich advocating the organization of a "United States of Europe," the Soviet side made a strong statement, saying that Churchill was carrying out a Western group movement to confront the Soviet Union. Churchill's speech can echo Bernas's speech in Stuttgart, with the aim of invigorating the Germans and allowing them a place in the sunshine of Western democracy. Yers explicitly demanded that the small European countries break away from the Soviet Union and set their own direction according to his proposed Franco-German partnership plan. This plan is a provocation even to extreme Churchillists. Can you imagine Poland, Romania, and Yugoslavia breaking away from the Soviet sphere of influence and helping France, Germany, Franco's Spain, and other countries form what could be the most powerful country in the world near the Soviet border? Thinking of this, one immediately feels a bleak outlook. The "United States of Europe" has been the goal of some of the world's best idealists, especially after the First World War. The late French Prime Minister Briand was one of the main proponents, and what was accepted by the League of Nations was planned to form an autonomous federation, with a federal parliament in charge of its affairs, resolving some internal relations issues, and establishing a joint army for defense, just like the early plan of the American federal government. Later, although some argued that a unified Europe should extend from the Ural Mountains to the Atlantic Ocean, it is generally believed that it should be limited to the rugged area west of the Baltic Sea, up to the mouth of the Danube River at most. The first step should be to establish free trade between the states. The Soviet Union's state monopoly on foreign trade system is not applicable to the new federation. However, today's Europe is no longer comparable to the Europe before World War II. The rift between the Soviet Union and Western countries is obvious, which is Churchill's so-called Iron Curtain, so the federal system will ultimately be difficult to achieve.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 21st] Regarding a concrete plan for organizing the United States of Europe, the International Research Institute for European Issues has recently issued a declaration, signed by British Lord Beveridge, Sir Fleming, and French Héliot Curie, among others. The declaration stated: "The United Nations cannot alone prevent another war from happening, nor can it stop wars in its current form. The Security Council is powerless. According to experience, only a new world can be created. The current world must recognize that it is almost impossible to organize a world federation, and it is also impossible to form several groups to wait for future unification. Since Churchill has proposed the United States of Europe, we should put forward some concrete measures to eliminate all obstacles in the way of creating peace. At the same time, another proposal is to establish an international relations committee in each national parliament for mutual consultation, and then form a common international parliament, in which the Soviet Union can also participate at any time. However, in Germany, it must be proved that it has peaceful intentions before it can join. Therefore, all areas under the control of the United Nations, such as the Trieste region and the Ruhr region, can be well developed."</p>

<h3 id="e70">Allied Control Council Discusses the Issue of Nationalization of Japanese Coal Mines, Lack of Resources and Low Production are the Current Crisis <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper, Tokyo Correspondent, 21st] The basic policies of the Allied Powers toward Japan are mostly decided by the Far Eastern Commission composed of eleven countries in Washington and implemented by MacArthur Headquarters. In addition, there is an Allied Control Council for Japan, which is close to advisory in nature, and is composed of representatives from China, the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union. Since April of this year, the council has discussed the issue of expanding Japan's fishing grounds and the issue of agricultural land reform. The central issue in the past two weeks has been the Japanese</p>
<p>Nationalization of Coal Mines</p>
<p>In the previous meeting (4th), the Chinese representative, General Zhu Shiming, advocated that coal mines should be nationalized and expressed his willingness to exchange China's high-grade coking coal for Japan's low-grade coal. At the meeting on the 18th, Representative Zhu raised the case again, saying that China is willing to host the MacArthur Headquarters' plan to revive the Japanese economy. The impact of our country's proposal on the revitalization of the Japanese economy is undoubtedly significant. Because coal is the foundation of various industries and is necessary for various power sources, but the quality of coal produced in Japan is extremely poor, with a high ash content, loose and brittle, and not suitable for the metallurgical industry. Before the war, the coal required by the Japanese metallurgical industry was mostly imported from Northeast China, North China, and Vietnam. Recently, the situation of coal mine production in Japan can be said to be in a slump. According to the Yomiuri Shimbun, the average monthly coal production in 1941 was 4.6 million tons, and the number of miners employed that year was 334,000. By July 15 of this year, although the number of miners had not decreased, the monthly coal production gradually decreased. In 1941, the average monthly coal production per person was 13.5 tons, in April of this year it was 5.3 tons, and in June and July it was only 5 tons. At present, the minimum amount of coal required by Japanese industry is 2 million tons per month. The reason for the sluggish coal mine production lies in</p>
<p>Insufficient Resources</p>
<p>In addition, the lack of food is naturally a major factor, because the work in the mines is based on a kind of heavy labor. The second reason is that the price of coal is too low. The current coal price adopts a dual system, with a producer price and a consumer price. The producer price is subsidized by the government to cover the cost, but the government's subsidy cannot keep up with the rise in prices, so it is impossible to stimulate the increase in production. At present, the government's subsidy is 260 yuan per ton, while the production cost is 368 yuan. There is a lack of materials such as steel bars, explosives, iron, platinum, cement, textile products, and oils. The most fundamental reason is the problem of abandoned mines. The old mines have been over-mined during the war, and most of the buried coal has been mined out, and most of the equipment has been damaged. For example, for the Joban Coal Mine, 80 tons of water must be drained for every ton of coal produced. If new mines are not developed, the increase in Japanese coal production will be limited. Our country's representative's proposal has a great relationship with Japanese industry. Since the issue of nationalization of coal mines was raised in the Allied Control Council, the government and</p>
<p>Owners' Reactions</p>
<p>have not been very good. Minister of Commerce Hoshijima stated in the Materials Supply Adjustment Bill Committee of the House of Representatives on the 9th that the most important thing today is to increase production, but implementing nationalization would hinder production, so he would not consider it, and the mine owners, for their own benefit, naturally do not agree with the nationalization of coal mines. The owners advocate (1) that the allocation of food should be guaranteed. (2) Abolish the subsidy system and determine the selling price based on the production cost. (3) Priority should be given to the allocation of various materials. Various political parties are also paying close attention to this issue. The Liberal, Progressive, and Socialist parties advocate the establishment of a three-party review committee to study whether coal mines should be nationalized. The Socialist Party does not advocate immediate nationalization, but the implementation of socialized national management. The proposals of the Liberal and Progressive parties are: (1) Abolish the subsidy system and allocate materials such as wood and machinery in kind. (2) Restore the coal allocation method of 1943, that is, the Japan Coal Industry Company will purchase coal from each mine and sell it to the owners, who will sell it according to the government allocation plan, in order to increase the production awareness of each owner and strengthen their sense of responsibility. (3) Subsidize industries such as iron and steel, electricity, gas, railways, and fertilizers. Regarding coal mine</p>
<p>Management Methods</p>
<p>the opinions can be said to be endless, and the final decision will be made by General MacArthur, but according to the reporter's personal opinion, changes in management methods may not necessarily promote the increase in production, and the problem should be grasped from the current economic situation in Japan. The current economic situation in Japan can be said to have not yet reached a healthy state. The post-war malignant inflation and the confusion of the price system, and the fact that various materials have been overused during the war and are mostly dilapidated, all make the production of various industries stagnate. From the perspective of coal production, without the input of foreign materials, it is difficult for Japanese industry to recover to a healthy state. According to Japanese economist Yoshitaro Nishimura, the existing capital equipment is old and outdated and mostly old-fashioned. Not only was it not repaired during the war, but it was mostly used forcibly. Not to mention expanding production, it is difficult to maintain existing production. Therefore, the biggest problem at present is the material replenishment problem. Under the current production conditions, even if nationalization is implemented, coal production will only be bureaucratic nationalization, which will not be of any practical benefit. How can a vast wasteland where capital equipment is decayed be revived?</p>

<h3 id="e72">Report on the Work of the Investigation Team: Director Zhang Speaks with Earnestness; Deep Dissatisfaction with the Reception and Handling Work; The Investigation Team Upholds Impartiality and Does Not Seek Undeserved Praise; Speaker Pan Offers Several Suggestions <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai-Hangzhou Group of the Investigation Team for the Reception and Handling of Enemy and Puppet Assets in the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Region, nearing the end of its work, held a tea party yesterday morning at 10:00 AM in Room 218 on the second floor of the Bank of China, inviting people from all walks of life to report on the significance and process of the team's investigation work. Those present included Team Director Zhang Zhiben, members Cheng Zhonghang and Fan Zhengbo, as well as City Council representatives Zhao Junhao, Ma Junshuo, He Yuanming, and Wang Jian'e, Speaker and Deputy Speaker of the Council Pan Gongzhan and Xu Jiying, Standing Director of the Chamber of Commerce Jin Runxiang, Chairman of the China Industrial Association Wu Yun Chu, and more than sixty news reporters from various newspapers. First, Director Zhang Zhiben reported: "This investigation team, jointly formed by the Central Supervisory Committee, the National Political Council, and the Control Yuan, with very limited manpower and the shortest possible deadline, is charged with understanding the truth of the reception work. What do we rely on and why are we not afraid? It is because we all believe that local public opinion organs, mass organizations, and news reporters will be able to tell us as much as possible about what they have seen and heard over the past year, along with their feelings. In this way, the small number of people will in effect increase to two million, and the short time will increase to more than a year. For example, since our team arrived in Shanghai, we have received sincere cooperation from all sectors of society, which has strengthened our work and yielded significant results. On the other hand, improper reception and handling of enemy and puppet assets, as well as corruption by reception personnel, should originally be corrected or punished by normal agencies. For example, the concealment and appropriation of received assets fall within the scope of criminal law, property disputes fall within the scope of civil law, and improper or illegal administrative actions should be handled in accordance with the procedures of the Administrative Appeal Law and the Administrative Litigation Law. Other issues such as corruption and malfeasance by reception personnel can also be reported to the supervisory authorities. Our team is a temporary organization, and our work is limited to investigation. Once the investigation is completed, everything should be handed over to the competent authorities for legal processing. It is unfortunate that the country has temporary organizations, which are a last resort. We deeply hope that normal agencies can fully exercise their powers in accordance with national law, follow normal procedures, and respect the rule of law, which is the blessing of the nation.</p>
<p>Not Insulting the Widowed and Weak, Not Fearing the Powerful and Arrogant: Conducting Work with Fairness and Integrity</p>
<p>Since the team began working in Shanghai, it has received 525 documents, including 355 confidential reports, which have been classified and consolidated into 293 cases. As of the 20th of this month, the team has completed 208 cases, while 85 cases are still pending response from various agencies or are still under investigation. In addition, 85 units of Shanghai's reception agencies have submitted reports, with 4 units yet to submit them. Their superior agencies have been instructed to submit them as soon as possible. In addition to the members, the team's staff responsible for receiving, drafting, copying, and editing official documents consists of only nine people, who are all seconded from various agencies and are limited by regulations. Despite the hot weather, they still have to work all day, and their diligence is commendable.</p>
<p>The team members are determined to uphold the spirit of "not insulting the widowed and weak, not fearing the powerful and arrogant," and to conduct fair and upright investigations. Whether it is a confidential report from the public or a case submitted by various agencies, the team must understand the truth of the facts and seek conclusive evidence. If the evidence is conclusive, it will be immediately exposed. However, we are unwilling to make arbitrary decisions or sacrifice the reputation of others to gain a reputation for "severity." The object of the "investigation" is the work of reception and handling, with more emphasis on matters and less on people. Therefore, it is different from "investigation and prosecution." However, those who are affected by matters should be subject to legal sanctions, regardless of their identity. The team members are "cautious and careful" on the one hand, and "willing to work hard and endure complaints" on the other, which we dare to assure ourselves of. As the wise men say, "If the punishment is not appropriate, the people will not know what to do." They also say, "If right and wrong are not clear and morality is not emphasized, the world will be in chaos." For example, public officials who are corrupt should be severely punished by national law. However, the majority of public officials are now living a frugal life, and some are even unable to make ends meet. Yet, public opinion generally assumes that all public officials are corrupt, causing law-abiding public officials to consider retiring to preserve their integrity, while a few truly corrupt individuals remain at large, doing whatever they please. Similarly, during the Anti-Japanese War, most of the compatriots in the occupied areas were patriotic. However, because a few unfilial elements engaged in traitorous acts, public opinion generally assumed that all people in the occupied areas were traitors, causing most of the compatriots who were kidnapped and suffered great pain to be unjustly accused, while the true accomplices could disappear and conceal their crimes. Therefore, we believe that clarifying right and wrong is something that everyone should pay attention to.</p>
<p>Three Thoughts</p>
<p>During its time in Shanghai, the team has gathered a wide range of opinions and observed public sentiment. Summarizing these, we have come to the following conclusions: (1) The government's policy on reception and handling seems to be inappropriate. During the War of Resistance, industry and commerce were destroyed, and the people were impoverished. The government should have made the most of the received enemy and puppet assets to support the revival of industry and commerce and alleviate the suffering of the people. It does not seem appropriate to use these received assets to balance the government's fiscal revenue and expenditure. (2) Reception agencies are disorganized and scattered. There are as many as 89 reception agencies in Shanghai, each acting on its own, lacking coordination, unclear responsibilities, and conflicting with each other. This leads to an image of harassment and chaos. (3) The reception and handling work is too slow. Since the reception agencies are scattered, the handling work is also delayed. Factories and warehouses that have been sealed are subject to concealment and theft, or decay and rot due to the delay in handling. Some have not even been received, so that useful resources cannot be fully utilized, factories are closed, production declines, prices rise, and the people's lives are unbearable. These points can be said to be honest words. It is undeniable that the reception work has not been satisfactory. We should convey this to the administrative authorities, who will surely be willing to listen and accept and make improvements. As for the rumors circulating outside, which attach various labels to the government's reception personnel sent from Chongqing, such as "flying down from the sky," "drilling out from the ground," and "Chongqing Four Families," the team members regard these rumors as "the speaker is not guilty" and "the listener should take warning." However, these overly malicious rumors are morally and legally unacceptable. As the saying goes, "A rolling ball stops at a slight unevenness, and rumors stop with the wise." There is no shortage of rumors in the marketplace, and we hope that they will stop with the wise.</p>
<p>Grateful for Assistance</p>
<p>According to the Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau, the total value of enemy and puppet assets received in Shanghai alone is over one trillion yuan, while in Hangzhou it is only over one hundred billion yuan, a significant difference in proportion. With the limited manpower and short time of this team, it is difficult to expect a thorough investigation. Fortunately, during our stay in Shanghai for more than a month, we have received encouragement and supervision from all sectors of society at any time, and various trade associations have provided us with many sincere opinions. This is something that the team deeply appreciates. In particular, the recent dispatch of five representatives from the Shanghai City Council to participate in the work demonstrates the sincere cooperation between the public opinion organs and the team, which has enabled the investigation work to achieve faster and more appropriate results.</p>
<p>The team is scheduled to conclude at the end of this month. All confidential reports received, reports from the reception agencies, and cases handled are being sorted, classified, and compiled into a list, which will be made public in the future for correction by all sectors of society.</p>
<p>Inspector Cheng's Speech</p>
<p>Subsequently, Inspector Cheng Zhonghang delivered his remarks, saying: "Our government has been implementing the Five-Power Constitution for twenty years. The judicial and supervisory agencies, in particular, have maintained a fully independent spirit, free from any interference or constraint. The organization of this investigation team is ultimately due to its temporary nature, making it possible to be surrounded by power and favoritism. However, even so, the team should still maintain its inherent spirit of independence, not fearing violence, not being partial to private feelings, and resisting other kinds of constraints, so that every investigation case can achieve results. We hope that the public and the media will assist us in completing our mission."</p>
<p>Cheng Responds, Pan Clarifies</p>
<p>Finally, Cheng Zhonghang responded to the points raised by Speaker Pan: (1) The investigation team is a temporary organization, and there is no designated spokesperson to the outside world. At the same time, because news reporters are very enthusiastic in visiting the team to inquire about news, it fully demonstrates the freedom of expression. In addition, some confidential reports were directly disclosed by the original informants to the reporters. (2) Regarding the point of not creating a "severe" image through work, I believe that the team's work is not "severe" enough. How many important cases have been handled to date? Regarding the Sun Tianchang case, the team has already sent it to the court. How the court investigates it is not our responsibility. In addition, I said that "it is about the matter, not the person," which is correct, because "the matter" must be done by "the person." To investigate the responsibility for the matter, of course, we must also punish the person in charge.</p>
<p>After Cheng's response, Speaker Pan made two clarifications: (1) My original intention was never to restrict news reporters from interviewing. (2) I did not mention the Sun Tianchang case, but now I would like to briefly state my thoughts on the case. I believe that Sun Tianchang himself should bear legal responsibility, and the responsibility of the reception and handling agencies for suddenly sealing and then returning his warehouse should also be investigated." Although Mr. Pan and Mr. Cheng had a minor debate, they both hoped that the investigation work would achieve satisfactory results, and their words were earnest, receiving enthusiastic applause from everyone. Finally, the city's reporters stood up one after another to express their opinions, and the meeting did not end until around 12:00 noon.</p>
<p>Clarify the Right and Wrong of Cases, Review Cases Carefully, Neither Indulge Nor Wrong: Speech by Speaker Pan Gongzhan of the Council</p>
<p>Subsequently, Speaker Pan Gongzhan of the Council was invited to speak: He first expressed his admiration for the team's seriousness in working under such limited manpower and financial resources. He hoped that they would maintain their past spirit and complete their mission. He also hoped that the five representatives from the Council participating in the investigation work would maintain their position as representatives of the people, be prudent and meticulous, maintain an independent spirit, and assist in the investigation work. Mr. Pan continued: "Director Zhang said that the temporary organization of the investigation team is a misfortune for the country, and I quite agree. Because if the normal supervisory agencies could fulfill their responsibilities of correcting and supervising the reception and handling work, there would be no need to organize an investigation team. Therefore, I believe that the longer the term of the investigation team, the more it indicates that the country's politics have not yet truly gotten on track. Regarding the spirit of the investigation team's past work, I have only one suggestion, that is, when the members make public statements, their opinions cannot be concentrated, and the content is bound to be inconsistent. I believe that for each case, since it is adopted through a collective decision, it can be published externally by the person in charge, which is more appropriate. In addition, I believe that the investigation team is not trying to show a "severe" image through its work. As Director Zhang said, for each case, we must clarify right and wrong, review it carefully, and neither "indulge" nor "wrong," in order to avoid the problem of "generalization." Finally, I would like to add one sentence, that is, the investigation and reception work focuses on the responsible reception agencies and the people in charge of the reception work. Although the investigation team's work, by its name, is about the matter and not the person, the people who commit malfeasance in handling the reception work are often the objects of investigation. If the person being handled is not the person in charge of the reception work, but the person being received, then each investigation is tantamount to adding to the people's suffering. This unreasonable phenomenon should, of course, be the responsibility of the competent authorities that transfer cases from the investigation team." After Mr. Pan's speech, Jin Runxiang, the standing director of the City Chamber of Commerce, continued to express his hope that the director's statement that "received assets should be used to support industry and commerce and engage in construction, not to balance revenue and expenditure" would be directly suggested to the supreme leader, so that it could have an effect.</p>

Zhang Junfu opened Yongshunxing Used Bookstore at No. 603 Beijing Road, specializing in buying and selling Chinese and foreign newspapers and various used books, operating diligently and accumulating savings over the years. Several years ago, he opened a new branch at No. 521 on the same road. Zhang, due to his old age and illness, was unable to manage both stores, so he divided the family property into four shares two years ago. His sons Zhongfu and Zhongming each received one share, with Zhongming managing the old store and Zhongfu managing the new store. The old store had better business and a yearly surplus, while Zhongfu, being young and inexperienced in business, had mediocre sales. Therefore, he could not help but be jealous of his brother, and his sister-in-law, Ms. Sheng, often made sarcastic remarks, causing friction between the sisters-in-law. Fortunately, their father was still alive and often reprimanded them, preventing any incidents from occurring. Recently, Junfu returned to his hometown, and the brothers' disputes over business matters became more intense. The day before yesterday, after dinner, Zhongming, Zhongfu, Zhongming's wife Ms. Sheng, and the new store employee Lu Axing played mahjong in the old store until midnight. After eight rounds, Zhongfu and Axing were heavily in debt, so they asked to play four more rounds. Zhongming and his wife refused because it was late. Zhongfu left resentfully. The brothers returned to their respective rooms (Zhongming on the second floor, Zhongfu on the third floor). Around 5:00 AM yesterday morning, Zhongfu's employee Axing (who also slept in the attic on the third floor) got up to use the restroom and saw the door to the second-floor room wide open and heard groaning sounds. He rushed into the room and found Zhongming and his wife lying on the bed, covered in blood. Zhongming had been slashed six times in the head, and once each on his right shoulder and right finger, for a total of eight wounds. At the same time, Ms. Sheng had been stabbed twice in the head, and her right ear was almost severed. Axing witnessed the tragedy and shouted loudly, waking up the neighbors from their dreams. They rushed over and immediately notified the police at the post and telephoned the Old Gate Police Station. Criminal Division officers Feng Xiushan and Chief Sun Zhiming rushed to investigate and used a vehicle to rush the injured Zhang Zhongming and his wife to Renji Hospital for emergency treatment. Zhongming died at 10:45 AM due to severe head wounds, brain damage, and excessive blood loss. Zhang's wife, Ms. Sheng, is also in critical condition, and has not yet emerged from danger as of 0:00 AM this morning. There is no doubt that the perpetrator of this case is Zhongfu. At the time of the incident, Zhongfu was nowhere to be found, having already fled without a trace. The police station is currently investigating the matter. Furthermore, the knife used by the murderer was a military-style broadsword, which was both sharp and heavy. Zhongming was slashed as many as eight times, making it difficult to avoid death.</p>

<h3 id="e78">Joint Reception for the Press by the New and Old Commanders of the First Supply Zone: Report on the Reception and Handling of Military Supplies in the Nanjing-Shanghai Area; Wide Area, Heavy Workload, Severe Punishment for Any Detected Malfeasance <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Mr. Zhao Zhiyao, Director of the Budget Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense, yesterday afternoon, together with the newly appointed Commander of the First Supply Zone, Lieutenant General Fu Wen, jointly hosted a reception for the press in the club of the supply headquarters at the end of North Sichuan Road. During the reception, they gave a detailed report on the reception and handling of military supplies and the supply situation during their tenure as Special Commissioners of the Ministry of Military Affairs in the Nanjing-Shanghai area and as Commander of the First Supply Zone. Mr. Zhao first stated that since being ordered to establish the Special Commissioner's Office on September 9 of last year, the work has been quite difficult and heavy because the area under its jurisdiction includes not only the Nanjing-Shanghai line, but also Yangzhou, Hangzhou, Jiaxing, Ningbo, Yuyao, Cixi, Xiangshan, Anqing, Wuhu, and other places.</p>
<p>Reception Methods</p>
<p>The reception methods were separately stipulated by the surrender officers: (1) Nanjing Area: Enemy and puppet warehouses and factories were directly received by this office. Weapons, ammunition, food, clothing, and all military supplies held by the enemy army were received by the New Sixth Army and then handed over to this office. Trucks were received by the New Sixth Army. Vehicles were received by the Army Headquarters. (2) Zhenjiang Area (including Yangzhou): Except for the enemy's Third Division's warehouses accepted by the 57th Division, which were directly handed over to the First Supply Zone, the rest were directly received by this office. (3) Shanghai Area: Except for some military factories and cloth yarn ordered by the puppet Cotton Administration Council from the puppet Management Department, which were directly received by this office, the rest of the military warehouses and all military supplies were received by the Military Supplies Reception Committee of the Former Third Front Army and then handed over to this office. (4) Other places along the Nanjing-Shanghai Line: All were received by the Mixed Reception Group of the Military Supplies Reception Committee of the Former Third Front Army and then handed over to this office. (5) Zhejiang Area and part of Wuhu: They were received by the takeover group established by the Former Third War Zone and then handed over to this office in succession. (6) Anqing: They were received by the troops stationed there by the Former Tenth War Zone and then handed over to this office. A total of 105 receiving units, including military factories, yards, stations, and warehouses, were received, including 34 in Nanjing, 34 in Shanghai, 11 in Hangzhou, 7 in Jiading, 7 in Suzhou, 4 in Changzhou, 8 in Jiaxing, and others such as Zhenjiang, Yangzhou, Anqing, Taicang, and Ningbo, which only received a part of the food or a part of the military supplies.</p>
<p>Processing Methods</p>
<p>The receiving units and military supplies, except for military factories, which were taken over by personnel from the relevant departments with the principle of not stopping work, the remaining materials were ordered to be handled as follows according to their nature: (1) Report and Hand Over: All received materials that were non-military supplies or military supplies that were temporarily not needed were reported and handed over to the Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau. A total of more than 3.057 million pieces of cloth, more than 8,300 pieces of cotton yarn, and more than 27,300 bales of cotton were reported and handed over. A part of them were needed by the military and were approved by the Enemy and Puppet Property Review Committee in November of last year to be retained for military use. It is estimated that the value of the items reported and handed over by this office to the Handling Bureau (including all daily necessities such as undershirts, cigarettes, matches, soap, salt, etc.) is more than 300 billion yuan at current prices. (2) Supply: All supplies, such as grain, non-staple food, clothing, equipment, sanitary medicines, communications equipment, ammunition, etc., were handed over to the headquarters of the First Supply Zone for supply. (3) Storage: All stored items, such as guns, artillery equipment, medical supplies, vehicles, ships, ordnance, clothing, and raw materials, were handed over to the respective competent departments for storage.</p>
<p>Main Cause of Theft</p>
<p>Mr. Zhao and Mr. Fu also admitted that there were indeed cases of malfeasance and theft in the receiving warehouses. The main reason was the lack of original inventory lists, which allowed the managers to take the opportunity to steal. The second reason was that enemy and puppet properties were piled up like mountains during reception, and due to the lack of receiving personnel, criminals were mistakenly used. However, this situation has now been corrected. According to the two gentlemen, there were two or three theft cases in Shanghai and one in Suzhou, but the stolen goods have been recovered. The thieves were punished separately, with the most serious being shot and the lighter ones being imprisoned. In Shanghai, dozens of people have been detained for stealing from warehouses. Mr. Zhao also stated that it is difficult to deny that corruption occurred due to the vast reception area and the lack of personnel. However, although the reception work has come to an end, if any problems arise, we will not shirk our responsibility and will still be responsible. Zhao and Fu finally talked about the situation of the First Supply Zone. Zhao was originally the commander of the zone, but was transferred to the director of the Budget Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense in June of this year. His vacancy was filled by the deputy commander, Fu Wen. It is said that the business of the First Supply Zone is national in scope, from Guangdong in the south to the three eastern provinces in the north, and supplies are all transferred from Shanghai. Its greatest difficulties are (1) insufficient supplies, (2) budget restrictions, and (3) inflexible coordination in transportation, resulting in the required supplies for various troops often not being delivered quickly. Efforts are currently being made to improve this. The personnel are also of varying quality, with some being irresponsible and corrupt. We hope that all parties will promptly report what they hear and see to this headquarters. If it is found that there are indeed illegal activities or dereliction of duty, we will not protect our subordinates and will definitely punish them severely.</p>
<h3 id="e79">Wool Uniforms and Fuel Will Not Be Missed, Cotton Cloth Will Be Allocated and Sold Upon Arrival <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>Public School Employees Have No Obligation to Purchase Goods</p>
<p>The City Allocation Office first decided to allocate food boxes, but recently, some have become moldy, causing some complaints from the outside. According to Yin Tiyang, director of the office, who spoke to reporters yesterday, the distribution of goods to public school employees is done in imitation of the system in Beijing, with tickets for allocation, which is quite fair. If they do not wish to purchase certain allocated items, they are not forced to purchase them. Each allocated item is displayed in the glass window at the front of the office. If they are deemed not very practical, they can be given up. However, in fact, the number of people who purchase is very enthusiastic, and more than half have been sold in ten days, and some want to purchase double or more. As for some moldy items due to storage conditions, the office will immediately step up the opening of boxes and check them one by one to avoid the trouble of replacement. If there is any damage, it will not be issued. We hope that those who receive the goods will wait a little, as the speed of issuing goods will be slightly reduced due to the increase in the opening of boxes and checking procedures. For those who have already received moldy food boxes, there are places for replacement. We hope that each agency will collect them and bring them for replacement for convenience. When asked when cotton cloth could be allocated, Yin replied that it would be allocated and sold upon arrival from the China Trust Bureau. When asked about the allocation of wool uniforms and fuel in Nanjing, it was said that the Ministry of Economic Affairs had been requested, and the Fuel Committee had also written to the office to investigate the number of people. It is thought that the treatment of public school employees in Beijing and Shanghai is the same, and what is available in Beijing should not be missing in Shanghai. In addition, the Shanghai branch of the Relief Administration may soon designate items to be allocated by this office. The Administrative Yuan's Materials Supply Bureau has many types of items, and this office will certainly promote the distribution business step by step in accordance with the contract provisions to serve public school employees. Now that it is just starting, we hope that public school employees in Shanghai will assist us.</p>
<p>Moldy Food Boxes Can Be Replaced at Three Locations</p>
<p>In addition, according to the person in charge of the Goods Distribution Office, if mold is found in the food inside the food box, it can be replaced at the office's warehouse: (1) the Shanghai Municipal Government's Repair Shop Warehouse, (2) the Racecourse Warehouse, and (3) the Broadway Warehouse. The office has assigned special personnel to be responsible for the replacement.</p>

<p>[Our Dispatch] The Police Bureau has long established management and registration measures for prostitutes in this city. All prostitutes without licenses are strictly prohibited from operating. However, recently, unlicensed private prostitutes have been openly active, especially in the amusement venues of Sincere, Wing On, and other companies. The Police Bureau believes that the established policy must be thoroughly implemented. Therefore, it has reiterated the previous order to each branch bureau, enforcing strict crackdowns. The Lao Zha, Xin Cheng, and Taishan branch bureaus are ordered to intensify patrols from today onwards, and any prostitutes found violating regulations will be arrested.</p>

According to a report by the Datong News Agency, recently many have applied to a certain agency in this city to become automobile drivers. The examination courses are very crowded every day. Most of them are changing professions from rickshaw and tricycle pullers. It is said that there are about 10,000 people applying for automobile driver's licenses.</p>

<p>[Our Dispatch] The first batch of seventy-eight dependents of U.S. troops stationed in China arrived in Shanghai yesterday evening aboard the Ainsworth. In the fading twilight, one of the most joyful reunions on earth played out outside Wusongkou: husbands, wives, parents, children, passionate embraces, sweet kisses, hearty laughter...

Because it is not easy to find houses in Beijing, they are temporarily staying at the Broadway Mansions and the Peace Mansions on Yuyuan Road. It is said that the U.S. officers' club, the U.S. soldiers' club, and the U.S. Red Cross will hold grand welcome parties.</p>

<h3 id="e89">Visiting the Exhibition of Calligraphy and Painting of Past Dynasties: Treasures of Art, A Grand Sight; All 206 Pieces Are Privately Owned <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>[Our Special Feature] Shanghai's calligraphy and painting exhibitions have always been free of charge, requiring no tickets. Therefore, in exhibition halls such as the Ningbo Tongxiang Association, it is common to see visitors bringing their families, young and old, everyone crowding in front of the works of Tang Bohu and Zhu Zhishan, because they have heard of these two names in the "Three Smiles Fate" ballads. Seeing the paintings of beautiful women hanging on the wall, some people would criticize, "A bit like Chen Yunshang." And some painters in Shanghai would really try their best to paint the beautiful women in their works to look very much like Chen Yunshang. It is not uncommon for the exhibition hall to be noisy and smoky, and everyone seems to take the watermelon seed shells all over the floor for granted.</p>
<p>However, yesterday's China Painting Garden was different. Although tickets were sold for two thousand each, the visitors were still quite crowded. However, there was not a single person leisurely chatting while cracking melon seeds. This exhibition of calligraphy and painting of past dynasties, jointly organized by the China Cultural Relics Company and the China Cultural Relics Research Association, has works that are very different in quality from the exhibitions hosted by painting dealers on weekdays. According to their catalog, there are a total of two hundred and six pieces in the works, from Chu Suiliang of the Tang Dynasty to Wu Changshuo and Wang Yiting of modern times. All of them are private collections, and many of these collectors themselves are qualified to open their own works exhibitions, such as Pang Xuqi, Wu Hufan, Liu Haisu, and Wu Zishen. The selection of exhibits seems to have been carefully considered. Gai Qixiang is not seen among the paintings of beautiful women, Lu Lianfu is not seen among the landscapes, and Xu Gu, who suddenly became quite popular in Shanghai some time ago, only has one piece on display. In addition, the presence of Yang Jiaoshan without Zhao Songxue does not seem accidental. The fact that Qian Nanyuan has paintings but no calligraphy is even more to my liking.</p>
<p>I often feel that judging calligraphy and painting can only be done by seeking mutual understanding. Therefore, the knowledge of "brush and ink" ultimately lies in the two words "fate." I think what is good is good, I cannot force you to like what I like, and I am even more unwilling to worship idols or regard good calligraphy and painting as commodities that can be weighed by the pound. I only seek to make my heart happy, I don't need to seek "authenticity," and I don't need to value "antiquity."</p>
<p>Therefore, my favorite pieces are: (1) Yun Nantian's "Fish and Algae Picture," which looks only clear, beautiful, and unparalleled, with the realm of Song lyrics, extremely refined. (2) Wang Yougu's "Autumn Trees and Crows Picture." I think the achievement of this picture has reached its peak, with each stroke subtly protected between intentional and unintentional, and those who see it will feel relaxed and happy. Among the works of the Four Wangs in the entire venue, this picture can be considered the best. (3) Xiang Shengmo's "Stupid Herbs" is really a pot of old iris, with a butterfly perched on it. Although it is not colored, it looks like it is colorful. The intricate and detailed patterns on the butterfly's wings and the simplicity and strength of the iris form a complementary contrast, reminding me of Chinese Fanggan buildings—the basic concept often excels in simplicity, while the decoration is often not afraid of extravagance. Just like Chinese porcelain, its style is never as strangely shaped as the Japanese do, and the glaze on the porcelain is often so gorgeous that it can make art lovers all over the world admire it. (4) Li Rihua's "Lotus" is leisurely and mellow, reminding people of the realm of the late Master Hongyi's "Branches full of spring, the moon round in the heart of heaven." (5) Shao Mi's "Wang Xizhi Exchanging Fans Picture." One of the inspirations of this picture is that "freehand" and "realistic" are united. It is clearly "doing whatever one wants," but how accurate are the lines of this goose—this is almost the breath of Western painting sketches. What is different from Western painting is that there is charm, style, and the painter's personality here. (6) Qiu Shizhou's "High Scholar under Pine Shade Picture" and Shen Shitian's "Osmanthus Bookstore Picture" are just pleasing to see. (7) Wen Zhengming's "Tea Boiling Picture." The wood itself of this painting is not necessarily anything special, but the long inscription in small regular script makes you linger and ponder endlessly. (8) Xia Gui's "Spring Mountain Riding Picture" is sparse and bright, with a very high style. (9) The oldest piece in this exhibition is He Zunshi's "Sunflower Stone Playing with Cats," the silk is already dark, but the cats in the hill are really precious like jade and snow, with vivid spirits. The coloring and brushwork are very impressive! When this painting was created, Da Vinci and Michelangelo were still unknown.</p>
<p>Spending two thousand yuan to see a calligraphy and painting exhibition is unprecedented in Shanghai, but the content of this exhibition is so rich. Seeing such an exhibition is much more meaningful than watching a movie like "Lotus in the Water"!</p>

<h3 id="e90">Appropriately Allocate Educational Funds from Income of Enemy and Puppet Property: Proposal by Municipal Councilors Chen Baotai and Others <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Municipal councilors Chen Baotai, Zhou Feicheng, and others proposed to the Municipal Council that the municipal government should forward to the central government a request to allocate 12% of the income from enemy and puppet property in this city as educational subsidies for this city. The reasons are as follows: During the eight years of the War of Resistance, cultural and educational institutions in various places were mostly destroyed, especially in Shanghai. The central government has already allocated funds to subsidize other provinces and cities (such as Nanjing, which has already been allocated 1 billion yuan), but this city has not yet been benefited. This city has a large population, and the number of students is naturally large. However, the schools that have been restored after the recovery have been mostly destroyed. However, they are limited by funds and cannot afford to repair them, so they cannot accommodate as many students as possible, resulting in many candidates feeling that they have lost their chance to study this season. It is now proposed that the municipal government follow the central government's allocation of subsidies to various provinces and cities, and request the central government to appropriately allocate funds to subsidize educational institutions in this city from the income of enemy and puppet property in this city. Thus, what is taken from the local area will still be used in the local area. It is hoped that the young people who have lost their chance to study will be fortunate, education will be fortunate, and the country will be fortunate. (Measures) (1) It is proposed that the municipal government follow the central government's allocation of subsidies to various provinces and cities, and request the central government to allocate 12% of the income from enemy and puppet property in this city as educational subsidies. (2) Nanjing has a population of 600,000, and has been allocated 100 million yuan in educational subsidies by the central government. Shanghai has a population of 4 million, and it is proposed to allocate it proportionally from the income of enemy and puppet property. Before it is allocated, the National Bank will first lend 60 million yuan in educational subsidies to meet the urgent need. It is heard that the Municipal Council will discuss this case today. As it concerns subsidizing education, it is unlikely that there will be any objections.</p>

Regarding the promotion of party affairs in Rehe-Mongolia, Yu Shiheng and Zhang Bingzhong have also been specially sent by the central government to supervise and guide. According to Yu, it is planned to first use Chaoyang as the center and then develop towards Chifeng. Zhang also said: The Rehe-Mongolia compatriots are very supportive of the central government. Although some young people mistakenly recognized the Communist army and blindly joined Chifeng, they realized that it was wrong and many fled back to the recovered areas.</p>

<p>Talk by Chief Supervisor Zhong Daozan</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch, Nanjing] Zhong Daozan, the chief supervisor of the Educational Supervision Office, has been a supervisor of the Ministry of Education for more than ten years before and after the war, making him the most senior supervisor. Recently, he came to the ministry from Chongqing. In an interview with our reporter in Nanjing, he said that the supervisors of the Ministry of Education, in the past year after the victory, up to the summer vacation of this year, went to various recovered areas to inspect and assist in guiding the educational restoration in various places. Except for Rehe, Chahar, Suiyuan, Taiyuan in Shanxi, and the nine northeastern provinces, which could only be inspected in part and could not be fully visited, all areas that could be reached by transportation in other provinces and cities were inspected separately. In the future, the educational inspection will be after the summer vacation. The method of distributing the supervisors to inspect different areas is being prepared, so that they can set off separately at that time. In this period, more attention is paid to secondary education, national education, and social education in the recovered areas, and guidance and promotion are given. As for higher education, because the return to school from the interior has just begun, or the entire return has not yet been completed, the higher education in the recovered areas is temporarily postponed. However, the colleges and universities and vocational schools above the specialist level that were originally in the rear, the so-called universities and colleges in the southwest and northwest, were not fully inspected in the past, so the supervisors will go to inspect them separately in this period. As for the inspection standards, except for the schools above the specialist level, roughly for primary and secondary education, social education, and educational administration, etc., nine standards have been formulated and printed into a special booklet. However, the post-war educational level is still difficult to reach the ideal standards of the past, so the supervisors can only use the actual situation as guidance.</p>

<h3 id="e94">Government-Funded Students Studying Abroad: Scheduled to Leave the Country This Year; Results of the Examination for Students Studying Abroad to Be Announced Soon <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch, Nanjing, 22nd] The examination papers for this year's government-funded and self-funded study abroad examinations have long been transported to Beijing and sent to experts for review. Most of the papers have now been reviewed, but for a very small number of specialized subjects, it is not easy to find suitable candidates to review them in the Beijing and Shanghai areas, so experts will be invited from other places to review them. The Examination Committee for Students Studying Abroad of the Ministry of Education hopes to announce the results of the examination at the end of this month, but if unexpected difficulties are encountered, it will be postponed to early October. The general performance of the students who participated in the examination this time is not high. Among the general examination subjects, the English subject is the worst. Generally speaking, students in the rear are better than students in the recovered areas, graduates of national universities are better than graduates of private universities, students who have not migrated are better than students who have just returned, and government-funded students are better than self-funded students. In addition, students who are admitted to study abroad at public expense should participate in training courses organized by the Ministry of Education for several weeks. Recently, because the Ministry of Education ordered all students to leave the country this year in order to enroll in this semester, it is planned not to hold training courses.</p>

<h3 id="e97">Shen Lu Arrives in Beijing to Report to the Ministry of Education on the Situation of Tsinghua's Restoration <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch, Nanjing] Shen Lu, the Secretary-General of National Tsinghua University, professor of Southwest Associated University, and acting Director of General Affairs, recently returned to Beijing from Kunming. According to him, the three universities of Southwest Associated University were restored to their original schools after the victory. Nankai went to Tianjin, Peking University and Tsinghua went to Peiping, and the restoration was a complete joint mobilization. Most of the faculty and staff traveled by air, while the students transferred from Guiyang to Changsha to Hankou, and then took a boat through Beijing and Shanghai to Tianjin and Peiping. Because the prices of plane and boat tickets increased, the travel expenses increased, which differed greatly from the original budget and were insufficient. He came to report the actual situation to the Ministry of Education and requested an increase in travel expenses. During the war, Japanese wounded soldiers lived in Tsinghua University, and the school buildings were severely damaged. In addition, the number of students before the war was two thousand and several hundred, and now it has reached three thousand. The repair and addition of school buildings require a lot of money. Fortunately, Minister Zhu agreed to provide assistance and said that he would try his best to provide relief. Now, half of the faculty and staff of Tsinghua University have arrived in Peiping, and about one-third of the students have arrived in Peiping. The remaining staff and students are on their way. This time, the three schools of Southwest Associated University jointly enrolled students, with recruitment examinations in eight locations. There were more than 30,000 students who took the examination. The examination papers have been collected and concentrated in Peiping. Because there are too many examination papers and the professors are still on the way, it will still take some time before the admission of new students can be announced. The principle of opening Tsinghua University on Double Ten Day will not be changed. If the start of classes can be advanced, it will be after October 20, at the latest November 1. Tsinghua will have a new life from the date of restoration. Shen will go to Shanghai in the next few days and then go to Peiping from Shanghai to assist Principal Mei Yiqi in actively preparing for the opening of school.</p>

The funds are limited to countries that purchase surplus materials, and are limited to 1 million U.S. dollars per year. The United Kingdom has already concluded an agreement with the United States for this purpose. China is currently in discussions. Once such an agreement is concluded, all U.S. students studying in China, U.S. professors lecturing in China, or Chinese students studying in schools in China that are supported by the United States, can be subsidized from these special funds. Chinese students studying in the United States will also be given travel expenses.</p>

<h3 id="e100">Raising Teachers' Salaries: Request from Municipal Primary Schools <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>Scheduled to Petition the Education Bureau This Thursday</p>
<p>Yesterday morning at 10 o'clock, the principals of municipal primary schools in this city held a principals' meeting at the Municipal He'an Primary School on Xin Zha Road. Wang Zunwu was elected chairman, and the resolutions were as follows: (1) Regarding the issue of raising teachers' salaries, primary and secondary school teachers should be treated equally. Secondary school teachers have already had their salaries increased this term, but primary schools have not been included, so it is requested to increase the base salary. Moreover, the teachers of the municipal kindergarten attached primary school already have a method for increasing their salaries, with an increase of 40 yuan for teachers, 60 yuan for directors, and 70 yuan for principals. There is precedent to follow. (2) Regarding the salary amounts of teachers who have been newly hired for this semester, which have not yet been approved by the Education Bureau, the school cannot afford to pay in advance. It is requested that the Education Bureau temporarily lend 400,000 yuan per person for the salaries of the new teachers for the eighth and ninth months. (3) Regarding the issue of the construction fee of 5,000 yuan per student collected by the school, it is not necessary to submit it to the Bureau. It is sufficient for the Bureau to send someone to review it. (4) Regarding the issue of leave for teachers who have been working for a long time, there are many teachers who have been working for more than ten years, or twenty or thirty years. The regulations stipulated by the Ministry of Education should be followed, such as the provision that those who have worked for more than ten years should take a year's leave. It is requested that the Education Bureau implement it. After discussion, it was decided that the principals of the central national schools in each district would gather at the conference room of the Education Bureau at 3 p.m. this Thursday to petition the Bureau.</p>

<p>Since the arrival of the Philippine Qunsheng Basketball Team in Shanghai, they have successively defeated Renyu and Huanan. Their skills are superb and have been widely praised. The team is scheduled to make its third appearance at 8:00 PM today, still at the Municipal Stadium, against the rising Dongfang Basketball Team of this city. Tickets are still 2,000 yuan upstairs and 5,000 yuan downstairs. Another grand occasion is expected on the side of Shaanxi Road.</p>
<p>The Qunsheng team has excellent teamwork and stamina. The three musketeers of the team, Chen Jinde, Chen Jinzhi, and Cai Wenhua, have a legendary reputation among fans for their miraculous shooting skills. The Dongfang team has enjoyed a considerable reputation in the mainland over the years. Taking advantage of the return of overseas Chinese this time (opportunity?), they have reorganized. Examining their roster, each member is a veteran with courage and skill. It is a pity that shooter Liu Zhenyuan is unable to attend due to intestinal disease. However, others such as Ren Xiangcheng, Tang Baokun, Wang Nanzhen, and Xu Heng have superb skills. Cai Yanxiong, who was injured in the hand during the Shantou team's match against the Air Force, has now recovered and is determined to play today. The momentum of the Dongfang team is strong, and today they may be able to show their skills and compete with Qunsheng.</p>

"Iron Foot" Sun Jinshun, "Iron Head" Huang Ruihua, and goalkeeper Zhang Rongcai were all former members of Youyou. During the War of Resistance, the team members dispersed, which led to the suspension of the association's affairs. After the victory, the former members of the team returned to Shanghai one after another. The organizer, Cheng Yize, specially invited former veterans to hold a symposium to decide to reorganize. Once preparations are complete, the official roster will be announced.</p>

<p>And Stipulates Two Measures for Compliance</p>
<p>The Municipal Government issued a notice to all agencies yesterday: "It is hereby notified to all agencies that the state establishes officials and distributes duties, each with its own responsibilities. Civil servants may not hold other public positions or any concurrent positions in addition to their assigned duties. The central government has long had explicit orders strictly prohibiting this. The Municipal Government previously received Administrative Yuan Decree Jingrenzi No. 4772, which was forwarded to be followed. However, fearing that over time, this would be disregarded or even openly violated, strict enforcement is necessary to uphold the law and regulate official conduct. Therefore, two measures are specifically stipulated as follows: (1) If it is indeed necessary to hold a concurrent position and it does not hinder the performance of one's assigned duties, it must be approved by the supervising officer and reported for record before the concurrent position can be held, but no additional salary may be received. (2) If it is not absolutely necessary and concurrent positions are held without permission from higher authorities, once discovered or reported, in addition to the suspension of the individual, the direct supervisors at all levels who failed to detect the matter in advance and did not report it for approval afterward shall also be subject to appropriate punishment in order to rectify the situation. Hereafter, all levels of personnel in this city should deeply understand this intention and strictly comply, and not regard it as a mere formality, lest they incur blame."</p>

<p>The Municipal Government approved a letter from the Ministry of Personnel, forwarding an order from the Examination Yuan, which approved a letter from the Secretariat of the Supreme National Defense Council, based on a proposal from the National Political Council, stating that those who participated in the War of Resistance in the occupied areas should be given priority for hiring and commendation. The Administrative Yuan was instructed to investigate and handle the matter. After investigation, civil servants who participated in the War of Resistance in the occupied areas risked danger, braved difficulties, and faced death. Their patriotism is truly commendable. Now that the War of Resistance has been won, those who are unemployed, without support, or unable to return to their hometowns due to banditry and traffic congestion, and who are destitute and lack food and clothing, should be given priority for hiring or commendation in order to clarify rewards and punishments and encourage morale. The Ministry has drafted separate letters to the provincial and municipal governments, instructing them to promptly investigate and register these personnel and give them priority for hiring. Those who meet the requirements of the regulations for awarding victory medals may also be requested to be awarded and commended. The situation of hiring and rewarding shall be reported to the Administrative Yuan and the Ministry for record every three months in order to streamline procedures and achieve practical results. The Administrative Yuan has approved the proposal and, in addition to replying to the Examination Yuan, has issued a letter to the Administrative Yuan to be forwarded for implementation. It is reported that the Municipal Government has instructed its subordinate units to begin investigating and registering personnel who participated in the War of Resistance in the occupied areas and to give them priority for hiring.</p>

<p>(Continued)</p>
<p>9. Occupation: All persons aged 12 or older must fill in this information. Persons under the age of 12 may not need to fill in this information. However, if a person under the age of 12 is employed, they must still fill in the actual situation. When filling in the occupation, it is first necessary to distinguish between employed and unemployed. Except for the three types of work: "managing one's own household affairs," "attending school," and "serving in the military," the standard for determining whether one is employed or unemployed is whether there is remuneration.</p>
<p>(1) Income that is not earned through labor does not count as remuneration, such as rental income from real estate property, interest income from capital, government relief or private assistance, such as pensions, etc. Those who rely on this for a living are considered unemployed. (2) If a person has more than one occupation at the same time, the occupation that provides direct remuneration is the primary occupation. If both occupations provide direct remuneration, the occupation that requires more working hours is the primary occupation. Only one primary occupation should be filled in during the survey. (3) If a person has previously been employed but is taking a break at the time of the survey, for example, due to vacation or illness, the original occupation should be filled in. (4) If a person has always been employed but is idle at the time of the survey because they have not found work, their original occupation should be filled in. For example, a porter at a bus station should still fill in "bus station porter" even if they have not found business today. (5) Unemployed persons should fill in their original occupation and fill in "unemployed" in the position or employer field. (6) A person who has never been employed, even if they are about to be employed, but has not yet engaged in that work, should still fill in "unemployed." (7) If a family member helps with the work of the head of household, increasing the income of the head of household or the family, but has no other related employment, their occupation is helping with the work of the head of household. If they have other work that provides direct remuneration, the occupation should be the work that provides direct remuneration. (8) Those who live by committing criminal acts, such as prostitutes, gamblers, etc., are all unemployed. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e112">15% Commodity Tax Rate Causes Great Shock to Wool Textile Industry: Limited Production Volume Does Not Compensate for Tax Revenue, Intolerable to Impose Heavy Taxes Under Pressure from Foreign Goods <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] The Shanghai Woolen Textile Dyeing Industry Association hosted the press last night. More than thirty directors, supervisors, and reporters from various newspapers attended. Cheng Nianpeng, chairman of the association, reported that the association currently has 57 members. The oldest has a history of just over ten years, while the youngest is only one or two years old. The machinery and raw materials are mostly purchased from abroad. In the past, wages were lower than in foreign countries, and costs were relatively light, so there was still a small profit to be made. However, since the victory, workers' arrogance has been rampant, and wages have been raised repeatedly, exceeding more than 10,000 times the pre-war level. In addition, the interest rate is too high, so costs have increased sharply, all of which are higher than foreign goods. All factories in the industry are feeling unable to maintain themselves. The government announced the Commodity Tax Regulations on August 16, stipulating that wool yarn, wool fabrics, and wool products will be taxed at 15%. The high tax rate and wide scope, once implemented, will only cause the entire industry to collapse. The object of commodity tax should be industries with a wide scope and a large output, which can indeed supplement the tax source. Currently, the industry only has over 20,000 spindles and only about 1,000 looms, including wooden looms. About 60% to 70% of them are currently operating. More than half of the factories have simple equipment, with only a dozen or two or three looms. Therefore, in terms of scope and output, it is not suitable for the collection of commodity tax. This is the first reason. The unified tax for cotton yarn is too high at 2.5%. It has now been changed to 5%, while wool yarn and finished products are as high as 15%. Both are essential clothing items, but the tax rates are so different. Examining the reason for this discrimination, it may be mistaken that woolen fabrics are luxury goods. This is the second reason. Adding taxes is tantamount to increasing production costs, which is contrary to the government's policy of suppressing commodity prices. This is the third reason. The price of domestic woolen textiles, even without taxes, is difficult to compete with foreign goods. Adding taxes will make it even more difficult to revive. This is the fourth reason. Finally, he appealed to the media for sympathy and assistance, hoping that the authorities would adhere to their consistent policy of production and construction, consider the difficulties of businesses, and withdraw the order.</p>

<h3 id="e114">Go to the Northeast: Rich Underground Resources, Fertile Above-Ground Products - Zhang Xiaomei Talks About the Northeast as a Base for International Commercial Warfare <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Shenyang 22nd Dispatch] Zhang Xiaomei, Director of the China National Economic Research Institute, recently came to the Northeast to collect and research Northeast economic data. He has visited factories and production institutions in Shenyang and Changchun and will soon return south to the United States. According to his conversation with a Taibao reporter, the Northeast is the lifeline of our country and a major resource area. I saw the outline of the Northeast factories, I saw the Northeast soybeans and sorghum, and I know that our eight years of bloody battle were not in vain, because Jiangnan produces mostly above ground, and North China produces mostly underground. The Northeast has both underground and above ground. From an economic point of view, it is an obvious surplus. International commercial warfare will inevitably take this as a competitive base. In the near future, there will be a factual manifestation. The Japanese have more than 40 years of history in the study of the Northeast economy. We cannot but admire their spirit of research. Of course, what they studied was to cooperate with their military actions. Today, what they have studied has disintegrated and is in chaos, but we must sort it out and transform it to complete it to suit our needs. The current issue in the Northeast is to revive the dead factories, to make the smokeless chimneys smoke, to export as much surplus products as possible, and to open up the exchange between inside and outside the customs. This is to open up this economic transportation line. The talents and capital of Beijing and Shanghai will soon flow to the Northeast. The loose funds in Shanghai have nowhere to use, or they may be the pioneers to the Northeast. In the past, there were about 1.5 million Japanese technical engineers in the Northeast. Most of them have now been deported, and it is estimated that less than 50,000 will remain. In my personal opinion, excellent Japanese technology and workers should still be retained. They are the keys to opening or restoring factories. Without this key, there may be concerns that the treasure house cannot be opened smoothly. In addition, a large number of domestic technical personnel should come to the Northeast. There is nothing to be afraid of in the Northeast. Everyone may compare the Northeast to the front line of the war. That is too much consideration, or it is a misunderstanding of the rumors. Currently, economists, engineers, and journalists in the Northeast should do more to open up the exchange between inside and outside the customs in order to develop the economy, to rebuild or build a new Northeast.</p>
<h3 id="e115">White Tung Oil Exports Stagnant: Hongjiang Tung Oil Sales Have Declined <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>Since the adjustment of foreign exchange, foreign trade in white tung oil has shown some vitality. However, the production area has also increased accordingly, so the recent export price seems to be miscalculated. Before the foreign exchange rate was changed, the export price in this port was 35 cents per pound in US dollars, but after the exchange rate was lengthened, it could only be sold for 33 cents. Including iron drums delivered to the dock, it only amounted to 115,000 to 116,000 yuan per market dan. Therefore, whether it is Zhejiang tung or Hankou tung transported for resale, the profit is very thin, and the operators find it tasteless. Domestic wholesale sales are between 117,000 and 118,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Hongjiang tung oil summer sales have already declined, and autumn sales have not yet started. The source and accumulation in western Hunan are still numerous, so the market is difficult to improve for a while. However, in terms of the proportion of all things, Hongjiang tung is not expensive. The overall reason is that the purchasing power of rural areas after the robbery is far less than before, resulting in oversupply. Although each brand, such as Yang Hengyuan, Qingyuan, Liu Tongqing, Liu Qingyuanfeng, Xiao Hengqing, and Xu Rongchang, are slightly different, the approximate selling price is always around 85,000 to 86,000 yuan.</p>

<p>[Reuters London 21st Dispatch] According to London tea authorities, the first batch of Chinese black tea since 1940 has arrived. The second batch of orders is larger and is expected to arrive in mid-October. The quantity of this tea is small and of low quality. The Ministry of Food has approved tea merchants to import 2.5 million pounds of Chinese tea. However, due to the precarious economic and political situation in the country and the rising price of new goods, transactions are difficult, so even the export of this small amount of tea is still problematic. Moreover, the Ministry of Food recently announced that the retail price of Chinese tea is 4 shillings and 10 pence per pound, while news from China says that most of the existing tea is not suitable for export. The import volume of Chinese green tea and black tea before the war fluctuated annually. In 1932, it was 5,428,000 pounds. In 1934, it increased to 17,795,000 pounds. In 1939, it fell again to 659,000 pounds. In 1940, it rebounded to 2,161,000 pounds.</p>

Soon, the ship will tow six barges and sail directly to Qingdao to transport raw oil from the China Edible Oil Company's scattered warehouses to Shanghai.

<h3 id="e120">A Comparative Study of the Old and New Income Tax Laws <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Riqing</p>
<p>(I) Introduction</p>
<p>Our country's income tax originated in the 25th year of the Republic. Not long after its establishment, it coincided with the war. The government moved west, the coastal areas were lost, and customs and other taxes sharply decreased. Income tax was compelled by environmental needs, and tax revenue rapidly increased, becoming the main source of national tax revenue. Examining advanced countries such as England and the United States, their income taxes also originated in wartime. For example, the British income tax originated in 1798 during the Napoleonic Wars, the French income tax originated in World War I, and the American income tax originated in the Civil War that emancipated black slaves. Our country's income tax originated during the July 7th Marco Polo Bridge Incident, which can be said to be a mutually illuminating event, following the examples of others.</p>
<p>Last year, the Japanese bandits surrendered, and the national territory was restored. The government considered the past eight years to be a trial period, and simplifications and deficiencies were inevitable. Therefore, it promulgated the new Income Tax Law on April 16th of this year. Examining its contents, the shortcomings of the old Income Tax Law have been modified, and it has been able to take into account the actual situation, gradually becoming more rational. Now, a comparative study of the old and new Income Tax Laws is presented for review.</p>
<p>(II) Old and New Comparison</p>
<p>Our country's old Income Tax Law had 22 articles, and the new Income Tax Law has 42 articles. Now, the differences and improvements are listed as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Property Rental Income is Merged, While Property Sale Income is Abolished.</p>
<p>Our country's old Income Tax Law was divided into three categories: 1. Profit-seeking Enterprise Income, 2. Salary and Remuneration Income, 3. Securities and Deposit Income. In the 32nd year of the Republic, considering the needs of the environment, the Separate Statute of Property Rental and Sale Income Tax Law was promulgated on January 26th, levying taxes on rental income and sale income of land, houses, warehouses, docks, forests, mines, boats, vehicles, and machinery. Property sales are all land sales. Our country already has land value tax, deed tax, land value increment tax, and other items. However, the direct tax bureau still levied property sale income tax on land sales, which seemed to be a duplicate. Therefore, in the new Income Tax Law, the abolition of property sale income is very reasonable. As for the remaining property rental income tax, the new tax law lists it as the fourth category, while also adding fisheries, and separately taxing the rental income of land, houses, warehouses, forests, mines, and fisheries, and the rental income of docks, boats, vehicles, and machinery according to their weight. The latter is taxed an additional 10% on top of the former's regulations. (2) Industrial and Commercial Enterprises, Companies or Non-Company Organizations are Taxed Separately.</p>
<p>Profit-seeking enterprises include organizations such as companies and businesses. The old Income Tax Law (Article 1, Category 1, Item A) stipulated that all companies, businesses, firms, factories, or individual capital with profits of more than 2,000 yuan would be taxed regardless of whether they were sole proprietorships, partnerships, companies, or non-companies. The new Income Tax Law will tax the profit-seeking income of limited companies, joint-stock limited companies, and limited companies, and the profit-seeking income of unlimited companies, general partnerships, sole proprietorships, and other organizations (Article 2, Category 1) separately. For the former, the tax exemption point is when the actual capital amount is less than 5%. For the latter, the tax exemption point is when it is less than 150,000 yuan. If the income belongs to manufacturers, the tax amount will be reduced by 10% according to the previous regulations. At the beginning of national construction, to enrich the people and strengthen the country, and considering that industrial capital turnover is slow, and commercial capital turnover is fast, and that industry is now on the verge of bankruptcy, while commercial speculation profits are generous, everyone abandons industry and engages in commercial speculation, resulting in a rampant speculative market and abundant floating capital. Legislators, in order to reduce the burden on industry, stipulate that the tax rate for manufacturing is reduced by 10% according to regulations, which is a major improvement. Furthermore, the separate taxation of companies and non-companies is intended to encourage company organization, because limited companies, joint-stock limited companies, etc., rely on share capital and money, while unlimited companies, partnerships, and sole proprietorships rely on individuals and credit. The new Income Tax Law can make further analysis and encourage the former organization, which is also appropriate.</p>
<p>(3) Business or Artistic Remuneration is Taxed Differently from Salary Remuneration</p>
<p>The old Income Tax Law stipulated (see Article 1, Category 2) that the tax rate for salaries and remuneration of civil servants, freelancers, and others engaged in various occupations was the same. The new Income Tax Law (see Article 2, Category 1) divides salary and remuneration income into two items: (A) Income from business or artistic remuneration, and (B) Income from remuneration. The detailed regulations are in the Implementing Rules of the Income Tax Law. Item A refers to lawyers, accountants, engineers, doctors, and drama performers, actors, etc. (Article 33). Item B refers to civil servants and employed freelancers. The tax exemption point for the former is those who do not exceed 150,000 yuan. The tax exemption point for the latter is those whose monthly income does not exceed 50,000 yuan, because the former's income is more fluid and the latter's is more fixed. At the same time, the former's income is often more than the latter's. The legislator can analyze in detail, which is a real improvement.</p>
<p>(4) State-Owned Enterprises are Taxed Universally</p>
<p>Our country's state-owned enterprises were originally not taxed. The reason is that whether state-owned enterprises are taxed or not taxed, the outcome is the same. As the saying goes, "the wool comes from the sheep's back," which is all money from the national treasury. At first glance, it seems reasonable, but upon closer analysis, it is inappropriate for state-owned enterprises to be exempt from taxes. The reasons are listed below.</p>
<p>1. The old Income Tax Law stipulated that the income of jointly operated government-business profit-seeking enterprises should pay profit-seeking income tax. According to this regulation, those with government-business joint ventures are taxed, and those with merchant sole proprietorships are taxed. Only state-owned ones are not taxed, especially since state-owned enterprises do not have a monopoly nature (those with a monopoly nature are not included), so that those with government-business joint ventures or private enterprises, their production costs or prices must be higher than those of state-owned enterprises, making it impossible for those with government-business joint ventures or private enterprises to compete. From the standpoint of protecting national industry, state-owned enterprises should not be exempt from taxes, this is the first reason.</p>
<p>2. If state-owned enterprises are not taxed, their costs and prices are lower, making the hosts unwilling to strive for improvement. If taxes are levied uniformly, a "survival of the fittest" competitive state is formed, and the hosts must be careful and strive for improvement, which is beneficial to the country and the people. The failure of our country's past state-owned enterprises is not unrelated to this, this is the second reason.</p>
<p>3. If state-owned enterprises are not taxed, when their profits are turned over to the treasury, they include a portion of taxes. In order to obtain accurate statistical figures, profits and tax amounts should be divided, this is the third reason.</p>
<p>Based on the above three reasons, state-owned enterprises should be taxed uniformly. The new Income Tax Law (see Article 3 of the Implementing Rules of the New Income Tax Law) stipulates that "the profit-seeking enterprises mentioned in this law include public enterprises and jointly operated government-business enterprises run by governments at all levels." This is a great improvement. It is expected that in the future, private and state-owned enterprises can compete with each other on an equal footing. At the same time, those who host state-owned enterprises should be vigilant, and can also eradicate one of the malpractices of state-owned enterprises. The above three points are the obvious improvements of the new Income Tax Law. The implementation of comprehensive income tax has epoch-making significance in the history of income tax in our country, which will be specifically described in the next section.

<h3 id="e121">A New Trial for the Two Major Ethnic Groups: China's Sovereignty in Hong Kong (Part 2) <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Ling Fang</p>
<p>Hong Kong Airmail, 19th of this month, from our newspaper.</p>
<p>Following the Hong Kong government spokesperson, our foreign affairs stationed authorities should also issue a formal statement regarding our country's position on the Kowloon Walled City issue, allowing overseas Chinese compatriots who care about the motherland to gain a correct understanding. Indeed, just before the reporter sent the manuscript, I received news that my Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Special Envoy to Guangdong and Guangxi, Guo Dehua, had met with Hong Kong Governor Yang Muqi on the afternoon of the 16th, stating that "the Chinese government will not abandon treaty rights, and the establishment of a administration in the Kowloon Walled City is in progress." The reaction that this formal statement from our officials can cause among overseas Chinese compatriots is self-evident. If this matter develops further, our country's sovereignty in Hong Kong will have a brand-new expression.</p>
<p>More than a month ago, after Ni Hui, a consultant from our Ministry of Judicial Administration, and Mr. Shidiwen, the new British envoy to China, passed through Hong Kong and returned to Beijing, the Hong Kong Xinsheng Evening News published on July 29th the news that "Our country will set up a court in Kowloon in the near future," which caused a sensation among overseas Chinese compatriots. The Xinsheng Evening News stated affirmatively:</p>
<p>This newspaper's reporter has learned from the most reliable sources that our country will set up a court in Kowloon in the very near future. Judges will be appointed by our Ministry of Judicial Administration. All Chinese and foreign civil and criminal cases will be handled by our country's court. Its nature will be the same as the First and Second Special District Courts in the Shanghai Concession before it was abolished.</p>
<p>This court will be the Kowloon Branch of our Baoan District Court. Our judicial authorities believe that Hong Kong is a ceded territory, while Kowloon is a leased territory. Establishing a Chinese court in Kowloon is permitted by international law. Before Guangzhou fell, Shi Yancheng, the president of the Guangzhou Court, had already returned to Hong Kong to conduct negotiations. Now, our Ministry of Judicial Administration is reviving the old matter and has raised it with the British Ambassador.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Judicial Administration believes that Hong Kong and China are only separated by a strip of water, and the customs and habits of the people are not very different, but Hong Kong's laws are very different from China's laws. For example: (1) Chinese women naturally have inheritance rights and special portions (Editor's note: a special portion is half of the deceased's estate, which should naturally be received equally by the heirs and cannot be freely disposed of by the deceased), while Hong Kong Chinese women have no inheritance rights. (2) In Hong Kong, a married woman who commits adultery will be imprisoned for six months, while a married man who commits adultery is not guilty, which violates Chinese law; (3) In Hong Kong, the eldest grandson has a special status, while China's Civil Code has long abolished this feudal legislative system. Our Ministry of Judicial Administration sincerely hopes that the legal differences between China and Hong Kong can be abolished as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Our judicial circles pointed out that Hong Kong courts judge cases based on Chinese law before 1843, but this type of law has been abandoned by China's Civil Code. Therefore, before establishing a Chinese court in Kowloon, it is necessary to seek a confusion of legal concepts; otherwise, it will be difficult to determine the rights and obligations of the people.</p>
<p>Regarding the selection of the president of the Kowloon Court, our judicial authorities are currently considering it carefully, because the position of the president of the special court is not high in the selection and appointment of Chinese legal officials, but the responsibility is very important. Our country intends to select suitable figures from Chinese lawyers in Hong Kong, but it has not yet been decided.</p>
<p>The Xinsheng Evening News dares to freely publish this shocking news alone in Hong Kong, which is still under British rule, naturally has sufficient arguments. It is said that this matter has caused considerable displeasure to the Hong Kong government authorities. The next day, the Hong Kong government's Information Department issued a statement denying this news: "The Hong Kong government has taken note of the news published by the Xinsheng Evening News on July 29th that a Chinese court will be established in Kowloon in the near future. The Hong Kong government wants the public to know that this news is completely untrue. Negotiations on the establishment of a Chinese court in British territory, whether ceded or leased areas, have never been mentioned or considered."</p>
<p>However, because the facts are all there, this cannot be denied. On the same day, the Xinsheng Evening News believed that the newspaper's reputation had suffered a major loss due to the Hong Kong government's statement, so it lodged a protest with the Hong Kong government. The Hong Kong government could not resist the Xinsheng Evening News's contention, so it also allowed the Xinsheng Evening News to issue a statement on the Hong Kong government's statement to recover the lost newspaper reputation. The Xinsheng Evening News issued a statement on August 1st saying.</p>
<p>"...The Hong Kong government's statement includes the present but does not include the future. It is a statement of facts but does not exclude the principles of international law and the intentions of the Chinese government.</p>
<p>Today, when Sino-British relations are harmonious, we publish this news as a matter of international law. Both China and the United Kingdom are nations that believe in the law, and naturally they can withstand trials in front of the law. Therefore, we must also declare that we are always considering the future of Sino-British friendly relations when publishing this news and this statement."</p>
<p>On the same day, the Xinsheng Evening News also published a Singapore airmail report dated July 23rd entitled "China and Britain Will Discuss the Future Status of Hong Kong," which said: "British Ambassador to China Shi Diwen, who is newly appointed, declared before leaving Singapore for Nanjing: Chairman Chiang and the British government will discuss the future status of Hong Kong at the appropriate time. Chairman Chiang has expressed that he will discuss the issue of returning Hong Kong to China. It seems that there is no problem for him to discuss this matter, and this is also the attitude of the British government."</p>
<p>Borrowing the British Ambassador's words</p>
<p>To raise overseas Chinese compatriots' awareness of the future status of Hong Kong and indirectly respond to the statement that "Our country will set up a court in Kowloon in the near future." Based on various facts, although the Hong Kong government has made a statement, overseas Chinese compatriots still believe that Chinese courts, like Chinese customs, will appear on the leased territory of Kowloon in accordance with international law. (Our country has the Kowloon Customs in Kowloon, which ranks second in the country in terms of import and export.) Since our authorities have intentions first, there will be results later.</p>
<p>Many people who talk about the Hong Kong issue only know about Hong Kong but do not know about the New Territories of Kowloon. In the treaty, Hong Kong is a ceded territory, and the New Territories of Kowloon are leased territories. Geographically, Hong Kong is an island, and the New Territories of Kowloon are the mainland. The former has an area of only 20 square miles, while the latter reaches 286 square miles. Having only Hong Kong Island without the opposite shore of the New Territories of Kowloon makes Hong Kong a veritable isolated island. Kowloon is the backbone of Hong Kong. Last time, the Japanese army first captured Kowloon before attacking Hong Kong. After the British obtained Hong Kong Island in 1842, they occupied an additional two or three square miles of land at the tip of the Kowloon Peninsula on the opposite shore in 1860 (Treaty of Beijing), which resulted in the distinction between New Kowloon and Old Kowloon. Then, in 1898, the British leased a large piece of land north of Kowloon and some islands, named the New Territories, before developing the current situation in Hong Kong. Therefore, in the eyes of the general public, the so-called Hong Kong includes the New Territories of Kowloon, which must be distinguished. When the Hong Kong Governor announced the new Hong Kong political system last month, the administrative districts under the Municipal Council were initially limited to Hong Kong Island, Kowloon, and New Kowloon. It can be seen that even from the British standpoint, Hong Kong, Kowloon, and the New Territories are not treated as one. After the war, the unequal treaties have been abolished, and Sino-British relations have undergone an epoch-making change. Even if the British cannot abandon Hong Kong for a while, the New Territories of Kowloon should be returned to us in advance. In order to take into account the friendship between the two major ethnic groups, the recovery of Hong Kong Island can be delayed for a while, but the restoration of sovereignty over the New Territories of Kowloon should not be delayed any longer, as this will cause many unnecessary restrictions (such as the national army crossing the river to the north and other transportation and traffic issues). Therefore, the issue of setting up a court in Kowloon and establishing a administration in the Kowloon Walled City arose one after another. On our side, we should make careful considerations, detailed plans, and thorough implementations in order to restore the integrity of national territorial sovereignty. On the British side, we must also recognize the changes of the times, face the needs of reality, and make goodwill expressions in order to repair the friendship between the two major ethnic groups. We are neither "overly hasty" nor "permanently silent," which is certainly not right. The British side's attitude of "arguing unreasonably" or "being obsessed with the past" is not necessarily clever either. It is said that in the above two incidents, the Hong Kong government should not ignore the facts and make a statement of "no silver buried here" (even under the threat of gunboats, it is not easy to force people to believe). Why not seek the most reasonable solution with the Chinese side openly and honestly? Problems must be solved eventually.</p>
<p>For the sake of the Hong Kong issue, the two major ethnic groups of China and the United Kingdom are facing a historical trial. The two major ethnic groups were able to fully cooperate during the war to defeat the common enemy. Can't they fully understand each other after the war and achieve a satisfactory solution to their own problems?</p>

<h3 id="e122">Two Western Newspapers Shout in Unison <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>After the Hong Kong government issued a statement on the Kowloon Walled City administration issue on the 14th of this month, Guo Dehua, the Special Envoy for Foreign Affairs in Guangdong and Guangxi, acting on instructions from our Ministry of Foreign Affairs, declared to Hong Kong's Yang Muqi that "Our government will not abandon treaty rights." The next day, He Fengshan, the Director of the Information Department and spokesperson for our Ministry of Foreign Affairs, issued a statement in Beijing in response to the Hong Kong government's statement. Personnel from the British Embassy in China also issued statements. In addition, with the responses and solemn expressions from various parties in Shanghai and Guangdong, this issue has changed from a local issue to an issue in Sino-British relations. The cause and course of this issue have already been reported in detail above. Now, I will summarize and analyze the reactions of the Hong Kong media and overseas Chinese compatriots to this issue in recent days to inform concerned readers.</p>
<p>Before Guo Dehua, the Special Envoy for Foreign Affairs in Guangdong and Guangxi, formally expressed our government's opinion to the Hong Kong government, only the Xinsheng Evening News and the Gongshang Evening News in the Hong Kong Chinese media had made any expressions (the opinions of these two evening newspapers have been seen in the previous newsletter). The Hong Kong Chinese newspapers' remarks seemed to still be intimidated by the National Daily incident three months ago, and they were somewhat "terrified" of the Hong Kong government's "flexible" defense law! After the Special Envoy for Foreign Affairs and the spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs successively made solemn expressions, the Sing Tao Evening News, the National Daily, and the China Daily successively began to discuss and review this issue. However, they are still limited by the environment and cannot speak freely:</p>
<p>The Sing Tao Evening News, on the 18th, used the title "On the Issue of Establishing a Administration in the Kowloon Walled City," cited the treaty, and believed that "the sovereignty of the Kowloon Walled City belongs to China, which is an indisputable fact." Finally, according to the spokesperson of our Ministry of Foreign Affairs, "It is hoped that the establishment of a administration in the Kowloon Walled City will be restored as soon as possible and proceed as soon as possible." The National Daily did not publish the Hong Kong government's statement on the 14th. Only after Guo Dehua made a counter-statement to the Hong Kong Governor on the 17th did it publish the two statements together, which can be regarded as a "unique measure." On the 19th, the newspaper wrote an editorial entitled "The Status of the Kowloon Walled City," proving that "the sovereignty of the Kowloon Walled City has always belonged to China." Targeting the words of the spokesperson of the British Embassy in Nanjing that the status of the Kowloon Walled City is a matter of "treaty interpretation," the newspaper said, "Under the friendship and understanding between China and Britain, it is very possible to study and study the treaty without hindering each other... We believe that no one will stubbornly cling to their own opinions." On the 20th, the newspaper republished the Hangzhou Datong Daily's manuscript "Today's Hong Kong Issue" in the original editorial's position, and published a special article entitled "A Record of the Vicissitudes of the Kowloon Walled City."</p>
<p>The China Daily's editorial on the 20th, entitled "The Issue of Establishing a Administration in the Kowloon Walled City," was relatively clear and powerful: the newspaper said, "...Today, when Sino-British relations are harmonious, and after Britain has announced the abandonment of unequal treaties, we still need to be scrupulous about the disputes over</p>
<p>one city and one pool</p>
<p>within unequal treaties. We can only feel ashamed and regretful, and have nothing else to say... We hope that the British authorities will have a broad and long-term vision, and focus on the big picture from a distance. Do not cling to the old and stick to the obsolete because of such small matters, causing displeasure to each other..."</p>
<p>Looking back at the Hong Kong Western newspapers' remarks on this issue, we are really filled with emotions! The overseas Chinese newspapers' remarks are mostly half-hearted, as mentioned above. Some are silent as cicadas in winter, some only "indirectly hint," or reprint the original telegram from the chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council requesting the recovery of the territories of Hong Kong, Kowloon, and Macau, or publish Wang Zhuyi, the secretary-general of the Shanghai branch of the China National Diplomacy Association, that conversation regarding the Kowloon Walled City establishment issue; some even did not dare to publish the full text of Guo Dehua's statement to the Hong Kong government, only briefly saying "something was negotiated," fully demonstrating their traitorous faces (Huaqiao Daily)... The Western newspapers' remarks are different. They clearly protect their own country, not only arguing unreasonably but also being sarcastic. The so-called Sino-British alliance has long been thrown to the back of their minds. On the 18th, two Western newspapers, the South China Morning Post and the De Chen Western Newspaper, both wrote articles reviewing the Kowloon Walled City issue. The South China Morning Post categorically stated that "This matter is not new and does not cause stimulation." The newspaper said, "Geographically, economically, and socially, the Kowloon Walled City is part of the Hong Kong colony. Even if Chinese rule is established in the city, it will not benefit China or the local people." The newspaper believes that if the Chinese government insists on this request, it should be "very organized" and suggests that London and Nanjing negotiate directly instead of treating it as a local event. The newspaper refers to this issue as "post-war neurosis" and says "It is a pity to let people who claim to be 'patriots' to mess with it." The De Chen Western Newspaper said: "This deserted city with only a few broken houses left, I believe that anyone can agree that it is not very important to the Chinese government. The treaty has been in place for more than half a century without incident. Now suddenly proposing to take it back, I believe that it will not greatly benefit Sino-British relations, but will cause trouble and disharmony." The newspaper seemed to blame us for not knowing what's good for us: "If China insists that this small matter will cause serious attention, it should submit its opinions through formal channels." — What an attitude!</p>
<p>Not only that, the South China Morning Post's "Bird's-Eye View Column" — a kind of "three words and two words" miscellaneous commentary text — especially fully reveals</p>
<p>a treacherous face</p>
<p>For example, the paragraph on the 19th said: "The Chinese fishing village of Ma Shi Wan was robbed by a group of pirates carrying machine guns and hand grenades. Citizens of Kowloon, please see." There was another paragraph on the 20th that said: "According to the Ta Kung Pao, 'At the beginning of the Pacific War, the Chinese army rushed to rescue Hong Kong day and night', but it has not arrived yet, it is a bit late." If it is said that the South China Morning Post's shouting is not done by a "gentleman," then the nonsense of the De Chen Western Newspaper is simply "rascally"! The De Chen Western Newspaper used the contemptuous word "Hum!" as the title of Wang Zhuyi's conversation. The newspaper also titled the Information Director and spokesperson of our Ministry of Foreign Affairs' conversation on the Hong Kong government's statement with the words "Pui Tsui!" What is the intention? This attitude of the newspaper has aroused great resentment among overseas Chinese compatriots. If the overseas Chinese newspapers used the words "Pui Tsui!" as the title of the Hong Kong government's statement, what would the Hong Kong government do? The De Chen Western Newspaper has repeatedly lost its manners, which shows the true attitude of most British people in Hong Kong towards our country and the Kowloon Walled City issue — the issue of our country recovering lost territory and restoring sovereignty — and how much anger it has aroused in them!</p>
<p>The Kowloon Walled City administration issue has become a problem of current Sino-British relations through various expressions. The Hong Kong and overseas Chinese compatriots are earnestly hoping that our government will make a major decision and immediately begin formal negotiations with the British side to recover Hong Kong and Kowloon and make a total settlement of this century-old problem!</p>

<h3 id="e125">Opinions on the Monks' Petition <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>Recently, Zhang Xiaosong, the Director of the Civil Affairs Bureau of the Municipal Government, proposed to the Municipal Council on behalf of the Civil Affairs Bureau: to allocate temple buildings for the use of autonomous organizations as office space. Because of the phrase "monks like those in the Jade Buddha Temple and Jing'an Temple, who specialize in having mistresses and playing mahjong," it stirred the anger of the monks, who believed it was destroying religion and insulting monks. Therefore, they formed a group to petition, demanding that the Municipal Council revoke the previously passed proposal: "To allocate or borrow temple buildings for the use of autonomous organizations as office space," and demanded that the Municipal Government punish Zhang Xiaosong, while openly publishing in the newspaper, demanding a written apology from Zhang Xiaosong.</p>
<p>After seeing the above actions of the monks, we suddenly felt indignant. Zhang Xiaosong's proposal was to allocate temple buildings for the use of autonomous organizations as office space. It is very obvious here that what can be allocated is of course a part of the temple's spare buildings, not all of the temple's buildings, and even less is it about confiscating the temple's property rights, nor is it related to the monks' own houses. There is no question of destroying religion at all. I dare to assert that the sentence in Zhang Xiaosong's proposal to allocate temple buildings does not contain the meaning of driving out monks. Zhang Xiaosong's intention in the proposal is only to use the temple's surplus vacant houses to supplement the lack of office space for autonomous organizations. Now the Municipal Government stipulates that if there are vacant houses among the people, they must be rented out. Vacant houses among the people are private property. In today's severe housing shortage, the government still wants to force them to be rented out, let alone the vacant houses of temples, most of which are industries created by alms or donations. In today's severe housing shortage, who says it is not appropriate to allocate a part for use as office space for autonomous organizations? When the Municipal Council passed this case, it added the three words "or borrow" under "allocate," which has already prevented boundless Buddhism. Unexpectedly, the monks' petition demands that the entire case be revoked.</p>
<p>In short, Zhang Xiaosong's proposal is for the public, not for personal gain. Now that he has been unreasonably attacked by monks for the location of the autonomous organization's office, we citizens should unite to help him and demand that the authorities set up a "Temple Vacant House Leasing Management Committee" to take charge of this matter. Please see that the whole country is now suffering from a housing shortage, but only the temples' grand buildings are vacant. Renting temple vacant houses as office space for autonomous organizations or local administrative organizations is an absolutely reasonable act, and it is definitely not destroying religion. I advise the monks not to rely on boundless Buddhism, but to be compassionate and convenient, which is what Buddhist disciples should be like. (Guo Yongxi)</p>
<h3 id="e126">Where Is the Conscience of the Relief Officials! <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>A reader living in Caoxing Town, District 2 of Shanghai County, a neighboring old woman, begs for a living. On the morning of the 8th of this month, she was notified by the Baojia head to go to the Tangwan Town District Office to receive flour from the Relief Administration of the Executive Yuan. The old woman went to receive it, but when she arrived, the supervisor (the commissioner of the Su-Ning Branch of the Relief Administration of the Executive Yuan) refused to give it to her. After the staff of the District Office proved according to the household register that the old woman was indeed poor and was also included in the roster, the supervisor insisted on getting a certificate from the Baojia head before distributing it. Helpless, the old woman had to return to town, ask the Baojia head for a written certificate, and go again. A sixty-year-old poor woman traveled more than ten miles back and forth, hungry and tired. When she rushed to the District Office, it was already after 5 p.m., and all the distributors had left. When asked the staff of the District Office, they said, "There are still more than eighty bags of flour left, but because the office hours have passed, you voluntarily give up, and there is no more. Because this matter is handled by the Relief Administration, the District Office has no right to advise, and it is completely controlled by the supervisor," etc. I think that the Relief Administration should focus on relief when handling relief work, and should not be limited by time. The supervisor still has a large amount of flour in the district, but he makes things difficult when distributing it, despises relief work, and neglects his responsibility. May I ask where his conscience is? No wonder the common people no longer dare to fantasize about the rosy clouds in the sky! (Wang Jinxiang)</p>
<h3 id="e127">Eliminate Corruption and Stabilize Prices <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>Dear Editor: I have a few small opinions that I would like to publish in your newspaper's "Reader's Opinions" column.</p>
<p>(1) The Shanghai Municipal National Identity Card, the newspaper said that the authorities announced the completion of the issuance, why is it that Huangpu District has not yet received it?</p>
<p>(2) The prices of entertainment venues, hotels, and bathhouses in this city have reached an extreme point, far beyond the ability of the common people to bear, and their rise is faster than other goods. It used to be said that the price of rice was expensive as an excuse, but now that the price of rice has fallen, the rising trend is still the same. This kind of acute expansion stimulates general prices. I wonder if the authorities have considered it and restricted it.</p>
<p>(3) To eliminate corruption, we must first stabilize the lives of civil servants. Otherwise, those who cultivate morality and integrity will never enter officialdom, because the salary is not enough to support integrity, how can they work with peace of mind? Corrupt people go deep into important positions, seek personal gain and engage in malpractice, and the phenomenon of "nine out of ten officials are corrupt" should be improved and severely punished, so that corruption is eliminated, society is peaceful, and practical benefits are relied upon.

<h3 id="e128">Poor People Cannot Get Relief Flour <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>Dear Editor: The second batch of relief flour arrived in Tai before the Mid-Autumn Festival, and the Relief Association deliberately delayed the distribution until the Mid-Autumn Festival. The custom in Taixing is that everyone, big and small households, must make steamed buns before the Mid-Autumn Festival to celebrate the festival. This approach really disappointed many people! There is also an unexpected thing. Before the flour was distributed, it was said that each person would only receive two catties. Now the flour is distributed, two large families get one bag, and two small families get half a bag. It is still those with assets who have the special privilege to enjoy it. The orphans and poor people are completely not given any, and the flour list made for the first time has been completely erased. I don't know what the intention is? At that time, many people questioned the Relief Association? According to the person in charge of the association, "This time is the method stipulated by the branch, and it limits the relief population to 4,500 people. It is to relieve refugees and those who cannot live due to the war. I have no right to handle it. In addition, the flour stamps have been issued, and it is inconvenient to withdraw them. We can only wait for the third batch of flour to come to Tai and then reissue them. Now I want to ask you all to forgive me." Such relief is still suffering a group of powerless small people.

<h3 id="e129">Housing Disputes Should Be Postponed <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>Dear Editor: Since the abolition of the Wartime Housing Lease Law, there have been many housing dispute cases in Shanghai courts, mostly because landlords demanded too much from tenants and used the excuse of taking back the house for their own use, but in fact they rented it to others to achieve their own goals. Therefore, a serious man-made housing shortage has been created. The Legislative Yuan is discussing the Lease Ordinance to protect the safety of people's housing. I hope that the authorities will postpone the judgment on housing dispute cases before the ordinance is promulgated. If it is still based on the pre-war law, then the salaried class will be displaced and it will be even more unbearable. (Jin Mingjing)</p>

<p>— Chongzhen</p>
<p>Yangzhou News, 12th</p>
<p>It is the Mid-Autumn Festival, the moon in the sky, "Raise your head to look at the bright moon, lower your head to think of your hometown." On this festive occasion, there are fires of war all over northern Jiangsu. How can my heart as a traveler not miss my hometown?</p>
<p>Therefore, I, covered in wind and sand, and with heavy steps, galloped on the Liu-Yang Highway (Liuxu to Yangzhou), and finally returned to my long-separated hometown.</p>
<p>In the car, looking out the window, there were no trees on both sides of the road, a scene of desolation and loneliness. Compared with the previous ten miles of beaded curtains and willows, the elegant and heroic charm of ancient Guangling is really unbearable to feel the changes of the past and present. The memory of "Where does the jade person teach the flute after the bright moon over the Twenty-Four Bridges?" again weighed on my wandering heart. However, today I return, things have changed, "The children of the past have all grown up, and half of the longtime friends have passed away." Lingering in thought, I walked sadly into this ancient city shrouded in a gloomy atmosphere.</p>
<p>The current war situation in northern Jiangsu is in a state that is both tense and peaceful. I had the opportunity to separately visit the military and political leaders in Yangzhou and ask about the situation in northern Jiangsu. I got some clear answers to this "mystery"-like situation.</p>
<p>Meeting with County Magistrate Zhang</p>
<p>On the morning of the 7th, I met with County Magistrate Zhang Jichuan, who was busy planning to settle the more than 50,000 refugees who were constantly fleeing to Yangzhou. He said, "This number already accounts for one-third of the entire city. On average, each Bao has about three Jia, all of whom are refugees who have fled from the Communist areas. This group of refugees will increase the unexpected burden on the people in Yangzhou City. However, the people in Yangzhou are not panicked by this, and prices have not increased because of this. On the contrary, they sympathize with the unfortunate experiences of these refugees and are very able to provide them with enthusiastic assistance. They are now too familiar with the various vicious and cruel methods of the Communist army: regardless of large capital, small capital, or poor people, each person is only allowed to plant three Mu of land; the landlords are ordered to hand over their land deeds; the slogan of 'Everyone eats' incites and calls on local thugs to preside over the struggle—these make them feel particularly warm living under the protection of the National Army."</p>
<p>The current situation is that the Communist army cannot threaten Yangzhou. The city defense is extremely strict, and the defense of the four suburbs is solid. From Daiqiao in the east (50 Li from the city), to Lidianzhen in the south (30 Li from the city), to Dayi in the west (60 Li from the city), to Sanlidian in the north (27 Li from the city), all are under the control of the National Army and the county self-defense forces. Therefore, the people of Yangzhou are living in unusual peace.</p>
<p>Regarding the roads, most of them have been repaired. The Yang-Tai Highway (Yangzhou to Taizhou) and the Yang-Yi Highway (Yangzhou to Yizheng) are both open. The Yang-Tian Highway (Yangzhou to Tianchang) has been opened to Dayi. However, the worst road is from Liuxu to Yangzhou, which is uneven and dangerous for cars to travel on. It is currently being actively repaired by Zhenyang Company and others, and is expected to be completed in about a month. In terms of education, the number of schools has increased compared to before the war. There are two provincial middle schools, one county middle school, and eight private schools. There are about 20 primary schools. Therefore, there are fewer students out of school, and education is not a problem.</p>
<p>The Slender West Lake in the scenic area was haggard during the period of its fall. Originally, a scenic area renovation committee was organized to prepare for the renovation, but due to funding and the current situation, it had to be put on hold indefinitely.</p>
<p>Recent Situation in Northern Jiangsu</p>
<p>Speaking of this, I hurriedly said goodbye to County Magistrate Zhang. I learned that in early August, Commissioner Lin, Deputy Commander Wu (now transferred to Taixing County Magistrate), and others spent two weeks inspecting Huangqiao, Jiangyan, Rugao, Hai'an, and other places.</p>
<p>I managed to find the private residence of Inspector Liu of the Commissioner's Office, who had had some friendship with me, hoping to hear some details about the inspection. The young man's emotions made him speak eloquently about many valuable materials.</p>
<p>In the past two months, the situation in northern Jiangsu has once been severe. Fortunately, the National Army responded calmly, and it has temporarily become peaceful. Since the Communist army's fierce attack on Taixing failed, their ambition has not died, and they are waiting for an opportunity to move. When the eastern line of Huangqiao, Jiangyan, Rugao, and Hai'an were all recovered by the National Army, the National Army, in order to avoid the expansion of the flames of civil war, did not take advantage of the victory to pursue along the Fandi. Unexpectedly, the Communist army took this opportunity to counterattack again, causing Huangqiao to fall again and Rugao to be in danger. The Communist army deliberately launched a civil war and destroyed peace, which has once again been strongly proven here.</p>
<p>The National Army has always been in a defensive position and never acts rashly, violating the agreement. It only takes self-defense when it is absolutely necessary. Therefore, in the course of troop movements and defenses, it often encounters unexpected attacks by the Communist army, forcing the National Army to helplessly retaliate and painfully retaliate. As a result, the people are left in panic and confusion. If the area is occupied by the Communist army again, the suffering of the people is beyond description by ink. No matter what means the Communist army uses to publicize and deceive the people, it will eventually lose the hearts of the people due to the proof of facts. Therefore, when the National Army is ordered to be stationed elsewhere, the local people cry bitterly, try their best to keep them, and finally only disappointedly welcome them in the street until the shadow of the National Army's ranks is no longer visible. Every common person then goes home disappointed.</p>
<p>Therefore, the common people have a hope for the National Army, "Once you come, don't leave"—because the Communist army will definitely know after the National Army is stationed in a place. As soon as the National Army leaves, the Communist army will immediately come and harass and loot everything. "Come quickly after leaving," the people still hope that the National Army will come again soon. The criticism of the common people is always so powerfully expressed.</p>
<p>In fact, the Communist army's gamble in northern Jiangsu this time was to try to occupy the entire northern Jiangsu and threaten Beijing and Shanghai. The National Army is only in a passive position and is unwilling to actively attack. In terms of troop morale and combat effectiveness, it is really unimaginable for the Communist army. Whenever a company or a platoon of the National Army is stationed in a bunker, the Communist army always wants to solve the National Army with a regiment or a battalion of troops, but in the end it is difficult to succeed. The National Army is not proud of this, and still sticks to its position and performs its task and mission.</p>
<p>Various Problems</p>
<p>Recently, in the counties and towns recovered by the National Army, the economy has been greatly affected because the Communist army has been entrenched for a long time and because it has issued counterfeit currency. It is hoped that the government can establish banks as soon as possible to properly handle this matter. In terms of land, under the control of the Communist army, there has been arbitrary division and the land ownership is extremely chaotic. Many original owners are demanding to take it back. It is hoped that the National Army will severely punish those thugs who helped the Communist army to ravage the people and fish in troubled waters, and on the other hand, request a fair way to rectify the land ownership problem.</p>
<p>In terms of population, because the Communist army cannot recruit soldiers and it is not easy to replenish them, they try their best to conscript able-bodied men in the liberated areas. Men aged 18 to 45 are forced to join the army. After a very short period of training, they are sent to the front line to fight the National Army. As a result, all of them are sacrificed in vain as their cannon fodder. The conscription of young women is also difficult to avoid. Therefore, the local population has been greatly reduced, and what is left are the old and weak. Many fields are unattended, and the food harvest has become a major problem. This is the greatest favor given by the Communist army in northern Jiangsu.</p>
<p>Finally, he told me that currently there is not a single Communist soldier in the entire northern Jiangsu, except for two counties: Yangzhou and Jiangpu.</p>
<p>Inspector Liu's words came to an end. Because I was going to the wounded soldiers' hospital to take a look, I shook hands with him tightly and said goodbye.</p>
<p>The Platoon Leader's Accusation</p>
<p>I visited the three wounded soldiers' hospitals one by one. Every time I went to a hospital, I was accompanied by those white-clothed angels. From their painful conversation, I learned that the weapons used by the Communist army were mostly those of the enemy. In particular, a seriously wounded platoon leader with four bullets in his body told me like an accusation that in the Battle of Shaobo, the Communist army's artillerymen and heavy weapons shooters were all enemy captives. The first-line troops all used Japanese prisoners and young people around 18 to 20 years old. Their core personnel all stayed in the rear and would never sacrifice them easily, letting those innocent young people die. "I always thought that the War of Resistance was over and I could return to my hometown in triumph. Who would have thought that the Communist Party would launch a civil war? Isn't my injury caused by the Communist Party? I don't want a civil war, but there is no way. If I don't defend myself, the Communist army will take my life. They destroyed the happiness of my family and destroyed the peace of the country. I swear to fight the Communist army to the end." I was infinitely moved by his passionate words and immediately went to comfort him and persuade him to take good care of his wounds.</p>
<p>35 Communist Captives</p>
<p>In one hospital, there were 35 wounded captives, led by Dr. Wang of the Second Convalescent Hospital of the Field Hospital. I entered their ward. The faces of those 35 Communist prisoners were "young, strong, and good people." I sympathized with their situation and was emotionally driven to ask them about their past lives with great concern. A brief account is given below: Zhou Chuanhong—Political Instructor of a company in the New Fourth Army, from Yangzhou, 25 years old, elementary school graduate, family of five, farmer. In April of the 34th year, he was tricked into joining the Communist army. He first served as the captain of the local guard (i.e., the militia). After the victory, the Communist army claimed that the enemy refused to surrender, so they tricked him into the front line and served as an instructor. This time, he was captured in Xiaosizhuang (eastern Yangzhou) due to injuries.</p>
<p>Chu Qing—Soldier of the New Fourth Army, from Hefei, 22 years old, knowledge level is acceptable, family is well-off, has 120 mu of land, all of which was struggled away by the Communist army, leaving only 15 mu (5 people, 3 mu per person). Therefore, in June of the 34th year, he was forced to join the army. At that time, the name of conscription was to fight the Japanese, but who knew that after three months of training, he would kill each other with the National Army. He knew that he had been deceived and could not escape. This time, he was injured in Tianchang and captured by the National Army. He was very happy and could see the light of day again.</p>
<p>Yang Jingen—Soldier of the New Fourth Army, from Zhenjiang, 17 years old, born into a farming family. In August of the 34th year, he was forcibly transferred from Jiangnan by the Communist army to serve as a soldier. The excuse was to go to Jiangbei to take over and accept surrender. Who knew that the Communist army was deceiving him? Now he is injured in the civil war with the National Army in the Battle of Shaobo. He is very painful and wants to return to his hometown in Jiangnan.</p>
<p>Most of the other 32 captives were from farming families. The fields in their homes were struggled away by the Communist army before they were forced to join the New Fourth Army. An hour later, with sympathetic eyes, I said goodbye to the 35 wounded Communist prisoners. After leaving the hospital, my heart was beating incessantly, feeling sorry for those who had encountered unfortunate fates.</p>
<p>Yangzhou's Chaotic Fee Collection</p>
<p>The next day at noon, I was preparing to return to Shanghai. A relative invited me to dinner, inviting me repeatedly, making it impossible for me to refuse. During the meal, a stranger brought news that shocked the city of Yangzhou: in addition to tuition fees, Yangzhou Provincial Middle School also charged teachers a living subsidy of 18,000 yuan per student. I was very surprised to hear this, so much so that I couldn't believe it. After the meal, I happened to see the text of a letter from the parents of students at Yangzhou Provincial Middle School to people from all walks of life in the Jiangdu Daily, confirming that what the guest said was true. Suddenly, my mind was constantly thinking about why Yangzhou Provincial Middle School did this. After thinking about it, I couldn't figure it out. I still suspected that with 1,200 students in the entire school of Yangzhou Provincial Middle School, this huge sum of nearly 20 million yuan was originally justified to provide for the teachers' lack of living expenses. However, the teachers and staff of the provincial middle school are all listed as civil servants, with fixed salaries from the government. Moreover, the Ministry of Education has also issued instructions to all schools to strictly abide by the regulations and not to arbitrarily violate them and forcibly collect teacher living subsidies. We can't help but feel extremely sorry for this rash move by Yangzhou Provincial Middle School. Respecting teachers is the behavior that students should have, but if students do not come from the heart, and teachers themselves initiate respect for teachers, isn't this a perverted form of respect for teachers? I stayed in my hometown for two days and was deeply impressed. The above is only one or two of the records, just to express my feelings for the withering state of Jiangdu.</p>

<p>Legal Questions</p>
<p>(1) Debt Treatment</p>
<p>Qu Shiyin asks: I borrowed 20,000 yuan in jewelry from a relative in 1929. I made a loan note, stating that the interest rate would start at 2%, and there was also a piece of farmland as collateral. But to this day, I have not received a penny of principal or interest. Although I have repeatedly asked for it, it has been unsuccessful. (1) Is this loan note still valid after 19 years? (2) If a pre-war debt is repaid after the war, should it be repaid in the original amount, or are there other methods? (3) Is it legal to calculate it in terms of rice price or 1,200 times in the countryside? (4) If he is unable to repay, is it legal to sell the male list as collateral?</p>
<p>[Lawyer Duanmu Kai's answer] (1) According to Article 880 of the Civil Code, the right to claim a debt secured by a mortgage has been extinguished due to the statute of limitations (refer to Article 125 of the Civil Code, the right to claim is extinguished if it is not exercised for 15 years). If the mortgagee does not exercise his mortgage right within 5 years after the statute of limitations is completed, his mortgage right is extinguished; (2) Refer to Article 12 of the Supplementary Example for Handling Civil Litigation After Recovery; (3) According to Article 878 of the Civil Code, the mortgagor may enter into a contract to obtain ownership of the mortgaged property in order to receive repayment after the maturity date of the debt.</p>
<p>(2) Cancellation of Marriage Contract</p>
<p>Yan Yangji asks: My friend Mr. Zhang is 21 years old this year (not of actual age). Three years ago, his parents made the decision and hired a matchmaker to arrange a marriage contract with Miss Chen. At that time, Mr. Zhang was forced by his mother to go to the woman's house for a blind date, and afterwards he said that it was okay or not. Since then, Miss Chen has often gone to Mr. Zhang's house, but Mr. Zhang himself is doing business outside and has never had a romantic relationship, nor has he ever said a word. Recently, Mr. Zhang has another lover and wants to cancel the marriage contract. The Chen family is demanding compensation for losses. Please ask (1) Mr. Zhang's marriage contract with Miss Chen is legally valid? (2) Is a marriage contract made by parents when they are 18 years old legally recognized? (3) Is Miss Chen's demand for compensation justified? (4) What kind of procedure should be taken for this kind of cancellation to be the most appropriate?</p>
<p>[Lawyer Duanmu Kai's answer] (1) The marriage contract is invalid; (2) It cannot be considered valid if consent is not expressed after adulthood; (3) Damages may be claimed; (4) Resolving the conflict through reconciliation is a better solution. Otherwise, there is only the verdict of the Yangzhou Court.</p>
<p>(3) Inheritance of Estate</p>
<p>Huang Xuan asks: I have been married for six years, and I am poor and unemployed. My father-in-law is deceased, and my mother-in-law has considerable assets. But she regards money as her life. Please ask (1) Does my wife have the right to open her mouth to share? (2) Must we wait until after my mother-in-law's death? (3) If it can be shared now, what are the procedures? What is the amount? (Her adopted son has already been divided into 200 mu, and my wife is her adopted daughter)</p>
<p>[Lawyer Duanmu Kai's answer] If your mother-in-law is willing to distribute the property, she can do so by giving it away during her lifetime. Otherwise, your wife can only wait for her death and claim her inheritance as an adopted daughter.</p>

<h3 id="e133">Another New Posture for Transportation Services: Bicycle Owners Can Avoid Theft Concerns <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>Setting up stations for management in various public places, with a small fee and responsibility for compensation</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Shanghai General Bicycle Parking Management Office, after half a year of preparation, was approved for operation last month by the Municipal Public Works Bureau. The bureau has designated 32 locations throughout the city, including parks, amusement grounds, large buildings, and public places, each to be equipped with one or two bicycle racks and wooden signs for identification. Each station will have one to two attendants wearing armbands. When bicycle owners park their bicycles, they will be issued a numbered parking ticket, and the fee is 300 yuan per visit, doubled for stays exceeding three hours. If bicycles are stolen or damaged during the parking period, the office will investigate the facts and be responsible for compensation. Yang Ziqiang, the promoter of the Shanghai General Management Office, is known for his enthusiasm in serving the transportation industry. Since the commencement of this service, bicycle owners can park their bicycles safely, with someone responsible, avoiding concerns about theft and lack of parking space. It is reported that when the office began its service earlier this month, a certain theater organized a crowd to cause trouble, destroying bicycle racks to obstruct its business. Subsequently, a request was submitted to the Public Works Bureau for investigation. Yesterday, a reply was received stating: "Both reports are acknowledged. In addition to forwarding the situation to the Police Bureau for comprehensive protection, and separately instructing theaters not to obstruct the operation, you are authorized to request assistance from the relevant police sub-bureaus at any time for protection. Please be informed, this is the reply." It is expected that this matter will proceed smoothly in the future, serving the city's transportation.</p>
<p>After Wang Lingji returned to the province, on the evening of the 18th and the morning of the 19th, he separately summoned the Deputy Commander of the Provincial Security and the Chief of the Municipal Police Bureau to inquire about the conflict between the security team soldiers and the police on the Mid-Autumn Festival evening. He strictly ordered an investigation into the perpetrators to uphold the law. Regarding the rash incident caused by the misunderstanding between Hu Jingan, Director of Education of the Provincial Cadre Training Corps, and Tang Xin, Mayor of Nanchang, due to the conflict between the security police, he also used an extremely impartial attitude to persuade Hu and Tang not to harbor resentment, hoping to appeal to the reporters' corps on this matter. The reporter replied: "Hu Jingan is a brave warrior who often performs on the streets, which is quite pitiful. Tang Xin is a humble scholar who lets insults pass, and his courtesy is admirable, each with their own strengths."</p>
<p>Before the war, there were about 13,200 shops in Nanchang. Current statistics show only 3,500. The most ornate shops are the silver and gold shops. At night, the dazzling neon lights indicate gold shops. The businesses doing best are cloth and timber. It is reported that timber has risen from 40,000 to over 60,000 yuan per load. Once Nanchang undertakes a large-scale reconstruction project, repairing 10,000 city houses, Jiangxi timber will be in short supply.</p>
<h3 id="e134">Sights and Sounds of Nanchang <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent of this Newspaper, Fang Canglang</p>
<p>The Jiangxi Branch of the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (RRA) has established eight refugee shelters in Nanchang, housing a total of 2,163 refugees. Among them, the elderly, weak, women, and children are unable to earn a living, and many are crying out in hunger and cold. After three visits to the refugee camps, reporters from Nanjing, Shanghai, and Hankou suggested to the Jiangxi Branch of the RRA that it provide relief, which has been adopted.</p>
<p>The Jiangxi Provincial Government has dispatched troops to suppress the clan fights in various townships of Fenyi County. It is reported that this trend is very prevalent in the province. Recently, it has been reported that several large households in Nanchang County are vying for seats in the county council and are brewing clan fights. The authorities are currently mediating.</p>
<p>On the 18th, the 34th meeting of the Standing Committee of the Provincial Assembly, after listening to the report by Dean Xiao of the Agricultural College, Chairman Wang Zhenxin suggested: (1) Select mountainous counties to promote early rice varieties such as "Nante No. 1" and "Poyang Early" to enrich the people's food supply; (2) Restore Yongxiu Cotton Field and improve cotton seeds to enrich the people's clothing; (3) Veterinary specialists should be trained in serum production to prevent animal epidemics.</p>
<p>The salaries of Jiangxi provincial civil servants have been adjusted since August, according to a central government order, in line with central government standards. However, the Ministry of Finance has only approved a 90% loan for the 490 million yuan difference in the adjusted salaries in Jiangxi province, and it has not yet been allocated, so civil servants are mostly full of worry.</p>
<p>Nanchang is the source of the New Life Movement. Opium and drugs will be eradicated, prostitution has long been eliminated, and gambling is not prevalent. However, the order in entertainment venues after the war is still chaotic, and there are open disturbances, causing the authorities considerable headaches.</p>
<p>On the evening of the 19th, the Nanchang Municipal Council and other twelve units hosted a banquet for the reporters' corps from Nanjing, Shanghai, and Hankou, as well as the American municipal expert Pei Te, the section chief of the Ministry of Interior Shen Erpeng, and the UNRRA representative in Jiangxi Duncan. It is heard that Nanchang's model city is certain to be realized. (Dispatch from Nanchang on the 19th)</p>

<h3 id="e136">How Can China Industrialize? <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>— Translated by Deng Shaoqiu</p>
<p>An Outline of a Post-War Five-Year Plan</p>
<p>Last August, the U.S. Department of Commerce's Office of Foreign Economic Affairs, Engineering Division, published a document titled "Guide to China's Industrialization—Basic Elements of a Post-War Five-Year Plan." A sequel was published in October, and this June, an abridged version was compiled from the general design of the two documents. This translation is provided as a reference for studying and caring about China's industrial construction and recovery. Translator: Shaoqiu.</p>
<p>(1) The Purpose of China's Industrialization</p>
<p>China has 450 million people, representing one-fifth of the world's population, but China is not a country composed of numerous cities; rather, it is based on villages and farmland, on which 85% of the people depend for their livelihood. Therefore, how can China, today's China, become an industrialized country in a few decades, and at what speed? These are fundamental questions. American industrialization took a century of effort to succeed, so this guide aims to provide encouragement and assistance, giving China a basic element of a five-year preliminary plan in its perplexed path of industrialization.</p>
<p>Ideally, if this guide is adopted by China in a broad industrial construction program, the benefits to China can be summarized as follows:</p>
<p>(1) It can complete the initial infrastructure of industrialization, preparing for the second step of perfect and balanced development in the future.</p>
<p>(2) It can transform manpower into productive use, and develop operational skills and various production techniques.</p>
<p>(3) Agricultural and mineral resources can be fully utilized.</p>
<p>(4) National income can be universally increased after the standard of living is improved, and production can be exponentially increased.</p>
<p>(5) Increased production can promote international trade on the one hand, and repay loans on the other.</p>
<p>(6) Government revenue can be increased, and the government's political and economic institutions can be strengthened.</p>
<p>(2) The Plan for China's Industrialization</p>
<p>In fact, China's industrialization began before the Sino-Japanese War. At that time, China had several well-established steel mills, chemical plants, and cement factories. But what achievements have been made in the past eight years? The key problem is the lack of a most practical and effective planning method to cope with the expanding development of Chinese industry. So how should China industrialize now? It should have an orderly and efficient plan:</p>
<p>(1) Establish industrial centers in mainland China.</p>
<p>(2) Expand export trade.</p>
<p>(3) Transform pre-war damage and existing industrial plans to peacetime industry.</p>
<p>(4) Develop water conservancy and hydropower projects, modeled after the Tennessee Valley Authority water conservancy project in the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Among these four planning steps, the first item is the greatest need in China's development of an industrial economy, which is to establish many basic industries as the foundation for large-scale industrialization. However, the plan for this establishment and development must rely on more detailed surveys of China's resources and conditions. As for the plan to expand export trade, it largely involves broad international trade issues, so it can be regarded as an economic problem rather than an engineering problem. The issue of transforming pre-war damage and existing industries also requires a full report on the status and nature of various industries before it can be addressed and specifically analyzed. As for the future development of water conservancy and hydropower projects, it is extremely important and requires years of regional research, design, and construction. However, preliminary research on this aspect has been conducted by Dr. Savage, Chief Designing Engineer of the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, who was commissioned by the U.S. State Department to inspect China and design TVA-type Yangtze River dams and other water conservancy projects.</p>
<p>(3) Steps for China's Industrialization</p>
<p>(1) Select several industries that are necessary for the material life of the Chinese people and develop them, then develop natural resources and use them as a foundation—seeds. The results of the development of these many seeds will provide basic tools, materials, and parts to help future industrial development.</p>
<p>(2) Determine the size of the factories according to the needs and the economic production units of work capacity. But industrial development must be balanced—that is, the size and type of factories must also be suitable and uniform—so that various industries can be protected and mutually supported and assisted.</p>
<p>(3) The improvement and expansion of transportation tools, because raw materials, fuels, electricity, water power, transportation, labor, etc., can determine the development of industry, distribution, and even the future.</p>
<p>(4) Training of skilled workers, technicians, and management talents, because China lacks technicians, and conversely, most people need work and training.</p>
<p>(5) As a part of industrial design, industrial occurrence must combine highly mechanized operations with low-level mechanized work suitable for early industrial development.</p>
<p>(4) The Financial Resources Required for China's Industrialization</p>
<p>The financial resources required for this plan are shown in the table below: Amounts are in thousands of U.S. dollars.</p>
<p>Appendix: Financial Resources Required for Transportation Industry Construction</p>
<p>Railways (Improvement and expansion of various railway systems): Requires 503,750</p>
<p>Highways (All-weather roads): Requires 165,400</p>
<p>Automobiles (Commercial truck fleets and shops): Requires 223,480</p>
<p>River Transportation (Improvement of water transportation): Requires 406,300</p>
<p>Other: Requires 45,000</p>
<p>Subtotal: 1,348,930</p>
<p>Total: 3,027,603</p>
<p>(Explanation) The estimated construction costs of factories in the above table refer to building construction and equipment installation, while other items such as property records and operating capital are not included.</p>
<p>Also, the "Other Expenses" in the above table include the cost of preliminary mechanical engineering, $15 million USD, and the cost of purchasing hydropower construction equipment for profit, $30 million USD.</p>
<p>Also, the electricity industry and power generation industry in the above table are calculated based on 1.2 million kilowatts of electricity required for industrial construction (of which 470,000 kilowatts of electricity include thousands of miles of transmission lines for factory construction).</p>
<p>In the above two tables, the transportation industry only considers railways, highways, and waterways as the most standard and accurate. River transportation is only an approximate number because there is insufficient material and no figures could be listed. Although air transport is also extremely important, it is not estimated and included because the possible extent of China's air transport development is still difficult to determine.</p>
<p>(5) The Labor Required for China's Industrialization</p>
<p>(A) Industry</p>
<p>(Thousands of USD)</p>
<p>Chemical Industry: 119.850</p>
<p>Manufacturing Industry: 42.640</p>
<p>Electric Power Industry: 99.420</p>
<p>Textile Industry: 84.300</p>
<p>Food Production: 267.400</p>
<p>Other: 1.000</p>
<p>Subtotal: 756.710</p>
<p>(B) Transportation</p>
<p>Railways: 82.300</p>
<p>Highways: 500</p>
<p>Automobiles: 193.130</p>
<p>River Transportation: 100</p>
<p>Subtotal: 276.030</p>
<p>Total: 1032.740</p>
<p>(Note) The estimated number of employees in the above Tables 1 and 2 is limited to direct production and supervisory personnel. Other management and sales personnel are not included due to the different factory workplaces and internal organizations. The so-called food production processing and distribution in Table 1 includes 400,000 people engaged in fishing.</p>
<p>Everyone says that the prerequisite for China's industrialization is a high degree of demand. The Chinese people must be consumers of Chinese goods. The Chinese people's demand for cotton clothing, fragrant soap, and other manufactured products is already considerable. In addition, the urgency of demand for luxury goods in recent years can lay a cornerstone for China's future industrialization.</p>
<p>In my opinion, if China's industry wants to be sound, then its biggest problem is whether to do it or not.</p>
<h3 id="e137">An Overview of Industrial and Commercial Management <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Baiyi</p>
<p>Manufacturing and Cost</p>
<p>——Fifth of the Problems of Production Organizations——</p>
<p>In ordinary factories, not much attention is paid to cost accounting. Even in some factories, even if a cost accounting department is set up, people who are engaged in manufacturing work seem to think it is superfluous. Some people think that it is more cost-effective to spend manpower or time on production work rather than on cost accounting. This view is of course wrong. In fact, because these people often come from small-scale workshops, they cannot understand the value of cost accounting.</p>
<p>In fact, if cost accounting is used as a kind of record and has a historical nature, then cost accounting will not have any great use. In fact, the use of cost accounting can be divided into the following points:</p>
<p>A. Cost accounting can point us to a profitable path. If a factory only manufactures one kind of goods, it is much simpler, because there are only two paths, one is to continue production, and the other is to stop work. But in general, factories often manufacture more than one kind of goods. Then, we need to know which kind of goods has the highest profit? Can we increase the production of the most profitable goods and reduce the production of the less profitable goods? After such a change, we can get more profits. To find out which kind of goods has a higher profit in the end, we need to use cost accounting to calculate the cost.</p>
<p>B. When market prices are unstable, when market prices are unstable, we will be affected by market prices. If it rises, then how much does it rise? If it falls, then how much does it fall? The prices of our manufactured products will also rise and fall, and raw materials will also rise and fall with them. In recent years, sometimes the market price of manufactured products has been rising day by day, but the price of raw materials has not moved. Sometimes the price of raw materials has skyrocketed, but the price of manufactured products has not changed. The former situation is related to power restrictions, high rice prices, and the impact on wages. The latter is related to the weak purchasing power of the public. When market prices rise and fall, we need to calculate the cost to see if we can still get a profit from the goods we manufacture. If we let market prices rise and fall without any budget, then we will lose money and not know why. This should absolutely not happen in business management.</p>
<p>C. Looking forward to the future, if a factory wants to develop in the future, it must have a clear understanding of everything at present. Only by knowing the current costs and everything else can we look forward to the future. Taking cost accounting as an example, if we know the current costs, we can estimate how we should deal with it if the future costs increase by 20% or 30%. If it is to increase by one or two times, then how should we deal with it? This kind of future planning must be based on current cost accounting.</p>
<p>D. Clearly distinguish the responsibilities of each department; if a factory manufactures one kind of goods, then things are relatively simple, and the need for cost accounting is not as urgent as in a factory that manufactures many kinds of goods. But in a factory that manufactures many kinds of goods, we need to use cost accounting to calculate the cost of manufacturing goods in each department, so that the responsibilities of each department are clearly defined. Although this is not a law for internal enterprises, it is at least a very useful participation. For example, if the manufacturing cost of a certain department in the previous month was 100 yuan per piece, and suddenly increased to 200 yuan in the current month, then the responsible department must study the reason for the increase and see if the reason is sufficient. At the same time, we can also look forward to the future situation based on the records of the past few months.</p>
<p>E. When market competition is fierce. In the industrial and commercial world, competition among peers is always present, but sometimes the competition is particularly fierce. For example, the goods of two manufacturers have a place in the market, and therefore there are restrictions on the sales price and they cannot be increased freely. Then the only thing we can think about is reducing costs. To reduce costs, the first step is to implement cost accounting. Also, if several factories are going to participate in a tender of an agency at the same time, then we must have an accurate calculation of the cost.</p>

<h3 id="e138">The First Pass Under Heaven <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>— Xie Bingying</p>
<p>Thank goodness, I was fortunate enough to have clear weather on my second day at Shanhaiguan.</p>
<p>After breakfast, I first went to the train station to inquire about news. I learned that the train to Shenyang was still not running, but Station Master Xu kindly comforted me, saying:</p>
<p>"A freight train will be sent out today to test the tracks. If repairs are completed in time, perhaps passenger service can resume tomorrow."</p>
<p>"No passenger trains?"</p>
<p>"No, because we fear another derailment, resulting in the unjust sacrifice of many lives." Since I couldn't leave, I decided to enjoy a day in Shanhaiguan.</p>
<p>Shanhaiguan is a small market town with a circumference of less than five *li*, belonging to Linyu County. The marketplace presents a simple appearance. Some streets inside the city are so narrow that only one car can pass, while others are twenty to thirty *zhang* wide. The shops are mostly single-story buildings, with only a few two- or three-story buildings that still retain a rustic feel.</p>
<p>People walk leisurely on the streets, not as hurried and rushed as people in large cities. The reason is simple: there are no cars speeding around, nor horse-drawn carriages or rickshaws. The only modes of transportation are rickshaws and donkeys.</p>
<p>The imported goods stores have almost everything one needs for daily life, but most of them are from ten years ago. Glassware has not yet arrived. Little girls still wear red pants and green short shirts, riding on donkey's backs, passing through the streets, attracting the gaze of foreign tourists. Everyone feels a sense of novelty. Shanhaiguan's customs still remain in the eighteenth century, quaint and charming.</p>
<p>Not long after leaving the east gate, one can see from afar the five large characters "The First Pass Under Heaven." Below the characters is a portrait of Chairman Chiang, drawn too fat, making people want to laugh.</p>
<p>Embracing this gate tower is the famous Great Wall of China. Climbing onto the city wall, the winding and twisting Great Wall, like a giant python stretching to the horizon, is truly magnificent! Recalling Emperor Qin Shi Huang's efforts to consolidate his dynastic throne, sacrificing the lives and property of the entire nation to build the "Ten Thousand Li Great Wall," I heard many people talking about the story of Meng Jiangnü weeping at the Great Wall. Some even wanted to visit the Meng Jiangnü Temple outside the city. A middle-aged man said with emotion:</p>
<p>"It's a pity we don't know where Meng Jiangnü cried. Why not erect a monument to commemorate her?"</p>
<p>They only knew the folk tale of Meng Jiangnü weeping at the Great Wall and insisted that it happened near Shanhaiguan. Therefore, a Meng Jiangnü Temple was built more than ten *li* outside the city, which is still very popular. People seeking children and wealth go in groups to burn incense and worship during the New Year and festivals, but recently, due to the current situation, few people dare to risk it.</p>
<p>Standing on the highest watchtower, looking into the distance at the undulating mountains, what a strategically important place! To the south of the pass is the boundless Bohai Sea, with surging waves resembling thousands of soldiers and horses in motion. To the north is the precipitous Mount Jiaoshan. Looking closely, it seems that every mountain and every large rock has the form of crouching tigers and coiled dragons. The overlapping mountains serve as a screen for Shanhaiguan, like rows and columns of troops standing on the hills. Such a strategically important place is no wonder it has been a battleground for strategists throughout history. Although the inscription "The First Pass Under Heaven" exists in many places, this is truly the first pass, and its terrain does indeed have the danger of "one man guarding the pass, ten thousand cannot break through."</p>
<p>A cool breeze blew in gusts, and the vastness around me reminded me of an ancient story.</p>
<p>Those who have lived in Wuhan know that there is a road in Wuchang called Xiong Tingbi Road, but few know that he was a famous general of the Ming Dynasty. When he was the Liaodong Pacification Commissioner in Shanhaiguan, his defenses were tight, and the Qing army could not succeed in several attacks. Later, the emperor dismissed Xiong Tingbi after listening to slander from petty people. Soon after, Wu Sangui was ordered to guard Shanhaiguan. Li Zicheng captured Beijing, and Emperor Chongzhen of the Ming Dynasty hanged himself on a tree on Coal Hill (now Jingshan Park). Wu Sangui's father was also arrested by Li Zicheng, who wanted him to persuade Wu Sangui to surrender. When his father sent someone to deliver a message to him, he said, "It doesn't matter, I will go and release my father." But he remained idle. Then someone came to report, "The entire family of the Master has been confiscated." Wu Sangui replied calmly, "It doesn't matter, I will go and he will return them." He still remained idle. Finally, someone came to report, "Chen Yuanyuan has been captured!" At this moment, Wu Sangui was enraged, slammed the table, and shouted:</p>
<p>"If I don't avenge this, how can I be a man!" So he immediately sent out troops, nominally to suppress the rebels, but in reality, he surrendered to the Manchus and welcomed the Qing army into the pass. Most laughably, Wu Sangui wrote in a letter to his father such phrases as: "Father is unfaithful, son is unfilial."</p>
<p>A soldier like this, not anxious when the emperor hanged himself, his father was captured, and his entire family was confiscated, but so obsessed, so protective, and so concerned about a prostitute, a soldier who betrayed the country's sovereignty and sold out the entire nation for a woman, what punishment should he receive under the law of the nation? It goes without saying. Therefore, the famous poet Wu Meicun satirized Wu Sangui in "Ballad of Yuanyuan":</p>
<p>When the emperor (referring to Chongzhen) abandoned the world, he repelled the enemy and recovered the capital below the Jade Gate (referring to Shanhaiguan), the six armies wept in white, and in a rage he defended her beauty. Even today, reading it still evokes lingering resentment.</p>
<p>There are several theories about the origin of the five characters "The First Pass Under Heaven." Initially, it was from the hand of Yan Song, the Grand Secretary of the Ming Dynasty, but because he was a bad traitorous minister, the plaque he wrote was hidden away. The one hanging now is from the hand of Xiao Xian, a famous calligrapher and writer of the Ming Dynasty. Some say that his tomb is at the foot of Mount Jiaoshan.</p>
<p>There is a very interesting story about the origin of the inscription "The First Pass Under Heaven" here:</p>
<p>The character "One" looks very simple, but it is not easy to write, especially when it is between the long "Di" character and the square "Guan" character. It is not easy to make the weight match evenly. (See picture)</p>
<p>It is said that one day, outside a small restaurant, a poor man who looked like a beggar came and asked the old owner of the restaurant for food. The old owner saw that he had delicate features, looked like a scholar, not a beggar, so he let him stay in the shop and provided him with food and lodging unconditionally every day. After staying for several days, this extraordinary beggar used a large piece of paper to write a "One" character three feet long and wide and gave it to the old owner, saying:</p>
<p>"This is my gift in return for your kindness. Keep it well, and it will be of great use one day."</p>
<p>After saying that, the poor man suddenly disappeared. Later, Emperor Kangxi went to the pass on an inspection tour and saw the strategic importance of this place, so he praised:</p>
<p>"What a strategically important place with mountains and the sea! It is truly the first pass under heaven."</p>
<p>Therefore, he immediately ordered his ministers to write a plaque with the words "The First Pass Under Heaven," but no matter who wrote it, the four characters "Tian, Xia, Di, Guan" were well written, only this "One" character could never be matched well, either the stroke was too long or too short, too thick or too thin. So the emperor issued another edict that whoever could match this "One" character would be rewarded with a certain amount of silver. At this time, the old owner of the restaurant hurriedly presented the "One" character that the beggar had given him. When he tried it with the other four characters, it was indeed very suitable. He immediately received a great reward, so he became rich and no longer ran a restaurant.</p>
<p>Although this is a mythical legend, everyone who has lived in Shanhaiguan for more than forty years knows this story, especially the old man who took my picture, who told it with relish and vividness.</p>
<p>After strolling on the city wall for a long time, I returned along the original route. Suddenly, I saw a fallen stone tablet with the four characters "Loyal, Brave, Righteous, and Valiant" engraved on it. Next to it was a line of smaller characters: "Site where former Police Chief Hanzawa Yoshitomo died in battle." I knew that this place had been through countless bloody battles, killing many enemies and sacrificing the flesh and blood of many of our brothers. Someone had written the two characters "Wang Ba" (turtle, a derogatory term) next to "Yoshitomo," and everyone who saw it felt relieved. I don't know what kind of mentality this is, I can only call it the psychological victory of "Ah Q."</p>
<h3 id="e139">Freedom and Shackles <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>— Shusun Ruying</p>
<p>Since the French Revolution, the word freedom has been shouted loudly. In the realm of art, freedom is also regarded as a treasure and is worshiped by artists. Freedom of artistic creation, whether in content or form, is equally important. Any suppression, restriction, or constraint on artistic forms is a shackle on artistic creation and cannot be accepted by artists.</p>
<p>In order to advocate freedom, shackles have been smashed. The "Three Unities," "Naturalism," and all the rules that restrict the thoughts and methods of expression of writers have been overthrown and discarded for this reason. When creators push open the boundaries of theory and move towards newer fields, it is the progress of art. And this progress is the victory of freedom and the victory of artists.</p>
<p>In fact, today's shackles were not shackles at the beginning. They did not hinder freedom, or even helped freedom. When Classicism was flourishing, the "Three Unities" gave Roman writers great help and guidance, but when the times advanced and the rules of Classicism could not be updated and changed, it became a shackle that hindered the development of art, and it was finally pushed down from its revered throne and shattered to pieces.</p>
<p>Even Romanticism, which highly advocated freedom, eventually became a shackle and was replaced by Realism. After the Industrial Revolution, science became increasingly developed, and Romanticism, which advocated passion and the development of individuality, could no longer be worshiped, and gradually declined.</p>
<p>In short, artistic freedom often varies with the evolution of the times. The artistic freedom of one era is often very different from the artistic freedom of another era. Similarly, the shackles that restrict the development of art also change frequently. It also changes with the progress of the times. Shackles are not always shackles, and freedom is not always freedom, but it depends on whether the content of art theory is in line with the spirit of the times.</p>
<p>Artworks have various styles due to different materials, creation methods, etc. Artworks are produced by materials and creation methods, but at the same time, they are also limited by materials and creation methods. This limitation, in the eyes of writers, is sometimes considered a shackle, causing them to lose their freedom. The struggle against this limitation will have two results: (1) seeking new creation methods or new materials, and becoming another type of art; (2) wanting to break through the limitation, but finally being confined to the limitation, causing the unity of art to suffer losses, affecting the value of the work.</p>
<p>Here, the meaning of freedom and shackles is mistaken.</p>
<p>For example, woodcut art, due to the limitations of materials (wooden board) and tools (woodcut knife), has its own characteristics. It is rough, powerful, obvious, and has strong contrasts, which is the unique beauty of woodcut art. Another example is drama, which must be created under the three restrictions of audience, actors, and stage. Losing one of them is no longer drama. These restrictions are by no means shackles, and there is infinite freedom within these restrictions. With the limitations of a charcoal stick and a piece of white paper, the painter can express infinite compositions and infinite feelings. A pile of clay can be transformed infinitely in the hands of a sculptor, displaying thousands of majestic and beautiful forms.</p>
<p>Seeking infinity within limitations, seeking freedom within "shackles" is a necessary cultivation for an artist.</p>
<p>To recognize what is limitation, what is shackle; what is freedom, what is licentiousness, why is it only true for artists?</p>
<p>The great writer Gogol of old Russia said in one of his letters: "If I were to become an actor, I would still have security... but I am a writer, so I have to starve to death."</p>
<p>Critic Ismailov said: "The writer's wife! is a cook, a laundress, and a dishwasher, with only one difference, which is that she does not receive compensation. If God gives them several children, then they are even more sufferers, meditating all day long, restless all day long; what will they give the children to eat tomorrow?"</p>
<p>Nekrasov, the Russian commoner poet with a nose reddened by the cold, said: "The fate of the writer is a well-known fate; a miserable life, an indecent title; ending this life in loneliness, half-starved...". He also said: "For three whole years, there was not a single day that I was not hungry. In big hotels, people often came in to read the newspaper without ordering anything to eat; I often did the same. When I was reading the newspaper, I would take the bread basket next to me and eat the bread. - This was my only food."</p>

<p>Even when Lu Xun was dying, he said: "I am like a cow, eating grass and squeezing out milk, blood." He even wrote a heavy and sad line in his will: "In the future, children, never teach them to be empty-headed literary men again."</p>
<p>The modern writer Mr. Lu Yan did not die in a disaster, nor was he destroyed by the flames of war, but also died in a life of poverty.</p>
<p>Recently, a friend told me about the hardship of writers' lives, which made me feel very sad. I heard that Mr. ××, who is currently living in Shanghai, has recently exchanged his wife's gold jewelry for emergency relief because of the difficulty in raising living expenses. The lives of dignified old writers are so desolate and so embarrassed. I really doubt whether the history of literature can continue to be written in the future? But when I flipped through the past records about the lives of writers, I found that it was the same bleak situation, and in their hardships, they lit up the light of prophets for future generations, illuminating the vast crowd. So I thought: these should be people who truly love humanity. They silently sacrificed everything for the crowd; they forgot themselves for the crowd!</p>

<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>The dawn of the 26th arrived. From eight o'clock in the morning, we waited anxiously for news. We wanted to see what method the Japanese would use to launch this "three-part" conspiracy. Nine o'clock. Nine thirty. Ten o'clock. Still no news came. I was just about to call Mr. W to ask about the situation when the person who delivered the letter to Dingyuan suddenly ran in. I wondered why he had been delayed for so long. It turned out that Dingyuan had been sick for several days with his annual bout of amoebic dysentery, along with a bit of neurasthenia. He was just starting to get better, and he slept very well this morning, so the person who delivered the letter stayed there waiting for a reply. Dingyuan wanted me to come see him immediately. He</p>
<p>Fortunately, the road bureau's factory buildings were only a few minutes away from us. I handed the affairs over to Number 04 and imitated "echoes in the valley," setting up a message relay system using three people: one standing on the hillside in front of the house, one standing at the corner of the road bureau, and one at a point not far from Dingyuan's residence. As soon as the news arrived, the first person would give the second person a hand signal, the second person would relay it to the third person, so that I could receive the information in a second or two at most.</p>
<p>Because I knew that the Japanese's major offensive this time was aimed at eliminating the Twenty-ninth Army, and Changxindian was a key point, inevitably bound to be affected, I had to let Dingyuan know a little so that he could make some preparations. As for all the men, women, old, and children of Changxindian, there was no way to limit them in advance. I could only see if there were any rescue methods available temporarily.</p>
<p>Dingyuan lived in a small house in the factory. For the sake of face, he didn't welcome guests very much. Even I, as a friend, had only been there once. If he hadn't fallen ill in bed this time, he would definitely not have let me visit.</p>
<p>It had only been a few days since I had seen him, but he had lost a lot of weight and looked very ill. It was said that the diarrhea had been stopped using a clyster method, but now he was just inexplicably anxious and constantly suffering from insomnia. This was because excessive worry had affected his nervous system. I had to see him, just to see if he could get up and walk around because I had already planned a destination for him - Chengdu, Chengdu University.</p>
<p>I told him about my plan euphemistically regarding travel expenses and provisions. Because he always acted like an English gentleman, I couldn't mention financial assistance to avoid hurting his "sense of self-esteem." I only said that I had some immovable funds, which I was preparing to remit to a friend in Chengdu, entrusting him to buy some things. If provisions were short, he could use them first, as long as they were returned within a year, plus interest equivalent to that of the bank. In total, it was only a little over a thousand dollars. As far as I, a single person, was concerned, it didn't matter. Did I still have to haggle over every penny and ask him for interest? But if I didn't do this, he would definitely refuse.</p>
<p>I said these words, paying close attention to his reaction. Who knew that my good intentions were completely wasted. His body was weak, and he couldn't say much. His wife, that virtuous lady, explained his plans for him.</p>
<p>Wasn't he thinking of moving his family to take refuge before? Later, when he heard me say that this "incident" was not a local affair, but a full-scale war, he suddenly changed his plan: he was preparing to join the army and work in communications. This was a way to use his expertise to contribute to the country. His wife and Meijun, if possible, including Zhajun, were willing to join the army hospital as nurses. The two boys, Shire and Shiyi, would be brought by him to learn communication technology. Zhujun would naturally be brought by his mother and sisters. He hoped that they could work within the same military corps to avoid family separation.</p>
<p>"As long as I can get out of bed, I will go and join!" he told me excitedly.</p>

<p>Autumn Rainy Night</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, we Shanghainese had our first autumn rainy night. Unfortunately, the rain was too heavy and too fierce, as if showing off the power of autumn. The bleakness exceeded the mood.</p>
<p>The world is not short of people who love rain, nor is it short of people who love autumn rainy nights. Except for those who are physiologically or psychologically abnormal, this is also a kind of persistence in taste. A kind of cultivation and appreciation that nature gives to people.</p>
<p>In the rain, the scenery of the city streets changed. Pedestrians were flustered, vehicles hesitated, and the lights were dim. Even the newly added sound of raindrops falling only further illustrated the surrounding tranquility. Rain is beautiful, especially rainy nights! You hold an umbrella, you walk alone, you carefully appreciate all this, and you will feel like you are enjoying it.</p>
<p>Balancing the Budget</p>
<p>Zhang Zhiben, the head of the investigative delegation, said at a reception yesterday:</p>
<p>"The first of the three main reasons for the poor handling of the work of receiving and dealing with enemy and puppet materials is an erroneous policy. After the victory, the authorities should have used the received enemy and puppet materials to cultivate people's strength and should not have used them to balance the financial budget."</p>
<p>In the past two months, the financial authorities have repeatedly announced that they have not increased the number of banknotes issued, and this has been achieved by bidding on enemy and puppet materials. If another two or three months pass and these materials are sold out, then what will happen? It's really worrying!</p>
<p>Chairman Zhang's words were a little late. Now, even if it is used to balance the financial budget, there are few days left.</p>
<h3 id="e144">Shanghai's Climate Is Often Abnormal; This Year's Weather Is Even More Bizarre <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>— Mishan</p>
<p>Over the years, Shanghai's climate has been more abnormal than normal. This year's weather is even more bizarre: suddenly cold, suddenly hot, unpredictable. After the Mid-Autumn Festival, the scorching sun still presses down, with autumn behaving like summer. But a burst of rain jumped from the height of summer to deep autumn. In June, the Xujiahui Observatory even announced that "there will be no summer this year," but who knew that summer would be particularly long, and it became "no early autumn this year."</p>
<p>Open the historical Shanghai meteorological reports and start with the hottest year:</p>
<p>That year was the 23rd year of the Republic of China (1934), and the highest temperature reached 104.4 degrees, breaking the 63-year record.</p>
<p>In the 24th year of the Republic of China (1935), the highest temperature was 100.8 degrees.</p>
<p>In the 25th year of the Republic of China (1936), the highest temperature was 97.2 degrees.</p>
<p>In the 26th year of the Republic of China (1937), the highest temperature was 99.9 degrees.</p>
<p>In the 27th year of the Republic of China (1938), the highest temperature was 98 degrees.</p>
<p>In the 28th year of the Republic of China (1939), the highest temperature was 99.1 degrees.</p>
<p>In the 29th year of the Republic of China (1940), the highest temperature was 99 degrees.</p>
<p>In the 30th year of the Republic of China (1941), the highest temperature was 98.4 degrees.</p>
<p>In the 31st year of the Republic of China (1942), the highest temperature was 103.6 degrees.</p>
<p>In the 32nd year of the Republic of China (1943), the highest temperature was 98.4 degrees.</p>
<p>In the 33rd year of the Republic of China (1944), the highest temperature was 102.7 degrees.</p>
<p>In the 34th year of the Republic of China (1945), that is, last year, the highest temperature was 100 degrees.</p>
<p>The highest temperature this year was 101 degrees. Compared with the highest temperatures of the above years, it doesn't seem to be anything remarkable, but in September, the heat soared again, and the highest reached 100 degrees, which was 0.1 degrees higher than the highest temperature of 99.9 degrees in the same month in the 26th year of the Republic of China (1937), creating the highest record in 73 years.</p>
<p>Several rains finally sent the autumn tiger away, but according to the report of the city's observatory, the weather will turn hot again in the next two days. What will happen? Let's wait and see.</p>

<p>— Mituo</p>
<p>The stock exchange opened on the 9th of this month. After a week of practice trading and reconciliation procedures, it officially opened on the 16th.</p>
<p>China has a very short history of stock exchanges. In the past, China's commercial organizations were all run by individuals or jointly funded by a few people, and there was no organization of joint-stock companies at all. In the Qing Dynasty, one or two shops acted as agents for stock trading in other cities. At that time, most of the buyers were compradores. Later, as the number of stocks issued increased and trading became more prosperous, the "Foreign Stock Broker Association" appeared in the 17th year of Guangxu (1891), which was changed to the "Zhongye Public Office" in the 31st year of Guangxu (1905).</p>
<p>In the third year of the Republic of China (1914), the Chinese Stock Business Association was established. The stock trading included more than 20 kinds of stocks such as the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, the Commercial Press, China, China Merchants, and Hanyeping. By the ninth year of the Republic of China (1920), it was expanded into the "Shanghai Chinese Stock Exchange," which was the first official stock market in China, 147 years after the establishment of the first stock exchange in London. At that time, the capital was 3 million yuan, and company stocks were opened for trading. It was suspended during the War of Resistance.</p>
<p>During the war, Shanghai businessmen flocked to establish new industries and engaged in speculation. In the 32nd year of the Republic of China (1943), the number of stock companies reached two hundred and several dozen, causing chaos in the market. The puppet government authorities also felt it was too outrageous and ordered a crackdown, but soon thirty or forty companies "legally resumed operations." At the same time, the puppet "Stock Exchange" also opened, and the inside story was smoky and unbearable to ask.</p>
<p>China's stock trading has always been centered on Shanghai. Besides Shanghai, there were only Beiping, Tianjin, and Wuhan. The Beiping Stock Exchange was established as early as the 7th year of the Republic of China (1918). It seems that Tianjin and Wuhan did not have exchanges established.</p>
<p>The stock exchange is originally a completely legal economic organization, and its role can guide idle capital and support industry and commerce. However, it is easily used by speculators to buy and sell short, manipulate market prices, encourage gambling, and shake market security. As Mr. Wu Guozhen said: "If the stock exchange can be run well, it may assist the government, stabilize finance, and stabilize people's livelihood; otherwise, finance and people's livelihood will be affected." At a time when industry and commerce are sluggish and finance is not very stable, everyone is giving special attention to the future development of the stock exchange.</p>
<p>Here, we must reiterate our hope:</p>
<p>"We hope that the stock exchange will become an investment market, not a speculative market!"</p>

<p>We elementary school teachers consider ourselves extraordinary, indeed possessing too much scholarly air. More than a decade ago, a former outstanding student greeted me the other day; he is now fully equipped with American goods. He advised me to change careers and help him with his foreign firm's business. My ordinary heart almost stirred, but I managed to maintain my gentlemanly self-respect and politely declined. I told my wife, and I received a scolding, mixed with my own mantra: "The essence of learning is nothing more than seeking peace of mind." Unexpectedly, my wife took a cold breath and said, "Only old people and scholar-officials are difficult to please!" I touched the beard on my chin, speechless.</p>
<p>An old colleague, Ran Xilai, came to talk. He estimated that my head teacher's salary was at least 500,000 or more. When I told him it was 230,000 and change, the expression on his face was beyond my clumsy pen's ability to depict. In short, he considered it a miracle. He said that a few strokes of his watercolor painting could equal a month's salary in a small city. This almost made me faint, and I blurted out my last sentence to my old friend: "Hehe, haha! Nietzsche said it well: 'This is an era in which everything must be re-evaluated...' "A hint of proud, bitter smile unconsciously floated up.</p>

<p>— Re-conquest</p>
<p>In China, and even worldwide, General Chen Cheng is the only one to hold the rank of first-grade general at the age of forty-eight. Therefore, Chinese and foreigners alike consider him to be a young and promising military man, a typical young general.</p>
<p>In 1899, in Qingtian, the smallest county town in Zhejiang, an old rural scholar's family welcomed a little angel, who is now General Chen Cheng, the Chief of the General Staff of the Ministry of National Defense.</p>
<p>Diligence and studiousness are his only characteristics. As a child, he studied extremely hard. Even after graduating from Baoding and serving as a squad leader in the first class of Huangpu, he remained the same. I remember one morning, before dawn, he took a book to the training ground to practice calisthenics and exercise. Because he was eager to start running first, he temporarily placed the book on the ground. At that time, President Chiang happened to be walking in the training ground and noticed a book on the grass from afar. Chiang was very surprised and wanted to find a name on the book, but it was not yet light, and he could not see it. Just as he was guessing, he discovered a dark shadow wriggling. President Chiang immediately asked, "Who is it!" He replied, "I am Chen Cheng." Chiang then knew that the book must be his again, and he thought to himself that this young squad leader was able to study diligently and seek progress, which was worthy of commendation. Therefore, after the flag-raising ceremony for all officers and students in the school, he specially commended Chen Cheng, saying that he was a role model for all officers and students in the school. Soon, he was transferred out of the school and appointed as a battalion commander. From then on, he gained the trust and appreciation of the president. For more than twenty years, Chiang has always valued him very much. He also admired the president very much.</p>
<p>In the 31st year [of the Republic, 1942], Chairman Chiang visited India. Before the trip, Chen Cheng was still on the front lines in Hubei. He was deeply dissatisfied with Chiang's trip to India and sent a telegram to express his opinions, but Chairman Chiang did not adopt them. After Chiang returned to Chongqing from India, he specially rushed from Enshi, the wartime capital of Hubei Province, to Chongqing, and once again expressed his meaning from the previous time in person. Although this is a small matter, it shows how sincere he is.</p>
<p>During the first Battle of Changsha, as the commander of the Sixth War Zone and the Ninth War Zone, he commanded on the front lines. Despite the enemy's continuous bombing and strafing, he showed no fear and remained calm and composed. Once, dozens of enemy planes were constantly circling overhead, and bullets rained down on the ground. His guards were so frightened that they lay down in the trenches, but he remained calm and paid attention to the enemy planes' movements. A timid guard, worried about the safety of the commander, shouted, "Commander, lie down!" He treated his subordinates with both kindness and strictness, which is perhaps the key to his success. Once, a division commander stubbornly defended a certain position, suffering heavy losses. But his order required the division commander to hold out until a certain time before retreating, but that division commander could not bear it until the last moment (only twenty minutes from the time of the order to retreat) and withdrew from the position. As a result, Chen Cheng executed the division commander without hesitation. Another time, when he was serving as the chairman of Hubei, the younger brother of a certain department director, who was in charge of managing public grain, embezzled public funds and was reported for corruption. He also showed no mercy and executed the corrupt official. It is said that when he was in charge of Hubei, as long as there was a bit of corruption, no matter how big or small, he would definitely enforce the law. On the other hand, he cared for his subordinates and loved them. Whenever there was chaos in the front-line battles, many officers and soldiers (including the wounded and the uninjured) lost contact with their units due to the fighting. As long as he saw or knew about it, he would immediately issue a relief fund.</p>
<p>He came from the artillery corps. Because of his fame, many people praised the greatness of the artillery. Some people say that President Chiang, Napoleon, Duan Qirui, Chen Cheng, and many other famous generals from China and abroad all came from the artillery. So, everyone unanimously circulated a good story in the troops: "Artillery is supreme." In fact, the artillery is nothing special. It's just that the main requirement for studying artillery is a good foundation in mathematics (trigonometry, geometry, calculus, algebra, etc.); otherwise, one will feel great difficulty in the theory of shooting and in actual shooting. People who are good at mathematics have a more scientific mind.</p>
<p>Chen Cheng has always had a bad stomach. His peptic ulcer was once very dangerous, followed by duodenal bleeding. He could not eat ordinary food and could only drink liquid foods. But since he took office as the Chief of the General Staff of the Ministry of National Defense, his health has gradually recovered. The first thing he did after taking office was to ban jeep girls in Nanjing. This order was indeed necessary in fact, but in theory, it was indeed somewhat detrimental to the status of women. Therefore, before the order was implemented, female compatriots wrote articles in the newspapers to express their opinions. Chen Cheng, a young general of China, we thank him for his efforts in the War of Resistance, and we wish him eternal health and happiness!</p>
