<h3>政府改組在商洽中　二全會將作初步決定</h3>
<p>〔本報重慶八日電〕政府改組問題，仍在醞釀之中，各方未提出正式名單，吳鼎昌曾於前日代表政府，分別與各方交換意見，各黨派尙作觀望狀態，均待二中全會之結果如何，始能決定參加政府之人選，故政府改組目前獲得多數之擁護，僅對憲草一章，堅持五權憲法之意見。至政府內部之人事，亦有種種傳說，茲據各方所得消息，政府各部人選，確有變動，組織亦有調整，財糧兩部，將有歸併可能。內政部組織決擴大，將由二中全會作初步之決定，一俟與各方協調再行宣布，政府之人選，屆時始能正式決定。</p>
<p>〔聯合社重慶八日電〕陪都今日謠傳國府議會大的在本月底組成，惟委員四十人擬在議會組成之前即全體辭職。中央執行委員多人始終認爲政治協商會議各決議案，對中共及其他黨派讓步過巨，故不斷抨擊，惟蔣主席力主採納，必可獲二中全會通過。此次全會自三月一日召開以來，政府本身與王外長等數要員，均遭直言責難，數委員指責政府接收東北措置失當，且不滿於東北行營主任熊式輝，主張免職，另派軍政部長陳誠繼任。又行政院長宋子文，今日在二中全會初次報吿政治經濟情况稱：對外貿易新條例實施後，二個月可見具體結果，四個月大獲成就，至本年底，經濟基礎可吿穩定。</p>
<h3>宋院長報告政治對經濟現狀決不推諉卸責　但必須追思過去計劃將來</h3>
<p>〔中央社重慶八日電〕二中全會八日第十次大會，除交通報吿外，大部時間俱在熱烈檢討政治報吿，大會於三時廿分開始，出席委員二〇三人，何委員應欽主席，首由主席團代表張道藩報吿稱：主席團接到委員一一〇人對於政治協商會議報吿國大問題之臨時動議，因指定由渠代表主席團加以說明，旋即宣讀說明書，旣畢，提案人認爲此案旣由主席團詳加說明，無容提出討論，而自動收回，主席依照議程，宣吿對於政治報吿之檢討，惟宋院長子文是時因事未到會，乃將交通問題提前報吿。交通部長兪飛鵬就鐵道。公路。航運。船舶·郵電諸端分別報吿，至四時四十分始畢。休息後，開始檢討政治，發言委員有呂雲章，胡庶華，馬元放，袁雍，李宗黃，羅貢華，胡秋原，黃宇人，鍾天心等，檢討中心仍爲人事制度，行政效率及經濟財政諸問題，後宋院長親自分別答復，秘書處宣讀政治報吿審查會委員名單，召集人爲李文範，谷正倫，范予遂。又九日上下午大會至六時十五分散會。</p>
<p>〔中央社重慶八日電〕二中全會八日上午舉行第九次大會，行政院長宋子文作政治報吿，原詞如次：主席，各位同志，本席今天奉命作政治報吿，在政治方面包括的部門很多，行政院已經將一般的工作報吿印好，分送各位同志檢討。主要的各部門如外交，經濟·財政等，亦已另由各部負責同志在大會上口頭報吿，今天本席所報吿的，是當前最緊要，最嚴重的問題，也是各位亦最注意的問題，就是經濟問題。目前的經濟狀况，可以說人人都不滿意，這是勢所必然的，即本席個人，亦覺得不但不能滿意，而且是極不滿意的一個人。不過本席絕對沒有推諉卸責的意思，現在但川事實向各位同志報吿，歷史敎訓我們，沒有過去，即不能有現在，沒有現在，不能有將來，所以要談到經濟狀况，必須要追想過去，要明白現在，然後可計劃將米。</p>
<p>應付最後一戰　支出日見增大</p>
<p>本席奉命担任行政院的事，是在撒卅三年十二月四日，在那個時候，正是日本軍隊向貴陽前進的時候、是我們抗戰最危險的階段，那時我們不幸，繼續的失陷了河南湖南。河南是產麥的，湖南是產米的兩個都是後方最重要的糧食供應區，並且又先後失了廣東，廣西兩省的大部份，斷絕了後方與東南各省的聯絡，財政收人的區域，已經减縮到祗可靠四川，雲南，貴州等省，而同時會卒遣凋軍隊，布置防務，招募新兵，補充缺額，凋遣一切物資，來應付最後的一戰，支出一天比一天膨脹，收入一天比一天减少，危險情形實在到了極點。卅四年春間，局勢稍爲穩定，盟軍在各方戰塲節節勝利，國軍也積極準備反攻，軍費更形龐大，當時各方面都以爲士兵待遇太壞，軍隊不得一飽，因此軍費不得不增加幾倍，但是收入並不能增加，政府在這種艱難狀况之下，爲求勝利之來臨，幾乎可說是赤手空拳來應付當前的局勢，祗可賴發行鈔票，以補收入的不足，這種情形，常然使物價飛漲，而且我們也都知道，自從抗戰開始之後，敵人佔據了我國的經濟要點，我們就靠發行來彌補一年一年的累積，收支相差一天比一天增加，而同時使用法幣的地區一天比一天縮少。這危險之大，無論何人均可明瞭，所幸全國同胞，都能深明大義，忍受戰時的一切艱難困苦，遂有抗戰勝利的一天，但是我們不能不注意，抗戰雖然勝利，戰事雖已結束，而因爲在這樣長久的抗戰期中，所受的物質和人事上的損失，財政上的損害，以致有今日經濟上這樣的困難。</p>
<p>戰後英法諸國經濟同樣困難</p>
<p>我們要知這，經濟上困難往往不表現於戰時，而反實現於戰時了結之後，第一次世界大戰後的情形，現在都還能記憶，這一次大戰後在經濟上的震動，常然比第一次還要劇烈，我們看法國，法人工業幾乎完全沒有被德國人破壞，因爲德國侵佔法國以後，還利用法國工業來製造兵工器材，而且德國投降也在日本投降以前，但是今日法國經濟上的困難，已經達到極點。再拿英國來說，英國本土從未被敵人侵佔，而亦以經濟關係，雖戰事終了，依然計口授糧，並且今日英國人民所享受的營養，比較戰時時期還低，我國經過了八年的抗戰，所受的損害，比較任何國家爲重，這好像一個久病的人，決不是一貼藥所能醫治，也不是一朝一夕所能恢復健康。</p>
<p>我國經濟不安四項主要原因</p>
<p>說到我國經濟不安定的原因，當然很多，但主要的不外下列四項；</p>
<p>第一，是一切重要的物資，因爲抗戰中長期消耗，加以敵人封鎖，雖有空運接濟，運輸力究屬有限，民用物資平均每月運到國內的不滿一千噸，至於淪陷區內被敵人搜括，而且因生產减少，物資亦極短絀，因之全國物資供應不能平衡，物價自然上漲。</p>
<p>第二，是在抗戰期內後方區域縮小，收入自爲减少，支出却是日增，政府倚賴發行增加，以爲彌補，因此發行愈多，物價愈漲，政府支出愈增，因而又不得不增加發行，以致演出循環的因果。等到戰事結束，淪陷各地一一收復，收入之增添尙未實現，而復員之支出甚爲浩大，須多加發行，物價之刺激，因之尤爲深刻。</p>
<p>第三，交通方面，因長期戰爭，敵人破壞及經濟封鎖的結果，交通工具逐漸减少，運輸物資的效能，也日形低落，幾乎達到完全停頓的狀態。（未完）</p>
<h3>軍調部嚴令熱河共軍　撤離平泉英里　執行小組到平已告停戰</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山八日廣播稱：北平調處執行部今日正式向熱河南部共軍提出哀的美敦書，要求共軍自熱河南部平泉北撤一百英里，至赤峯西北一帶，共軍若不接受命令，將負發動內戰之責任。調處執行部此項命令發表後，東北各大學留平學生，再度舉行反蘇示威，要求政府立即向蘇聯索回柬北九省。</p>
<p>〔中央社錦州七日電〕東北保安司令長官部參謀長趙家驤將軍，昨已由平返錦，趙氏四日奉杜氏電召赴平洽商要公，其主要任務，即爲辦理熱河境內共軍不遵守停止衝突之協定，公然製取平泉事。趙氏在平與三人小組之中央代表鄭介民會晤，聞北平執行部已嚴令共軍於二十四小時內，撤至赤舉西北地區，靜候調查解次，否則應負內戰責任。三月一日，共軍以執行小組到達平泉，圍攻始見緩和，乃逐漸後撤，陽爲停戰，陰謀襲擊。執行小組現正規定平泉內，違的運到建平之共軍，速予撤退，尙無具體解次</p>

<p>〔聯合社重慶八日電〕此間接中共方面消息稱，晋省臨汾執行小組已商妥附近四區，政府與中共兩軍，各退至一月十三日原陣地。</p>
<p>經濟部派專員接收焦作煤礦</p>
<p>〔中央社開封八日電〕接收焦作煤礦一事，原係新鄕執行小組討論問題之一，馬歇爾元帥飛新之行，對此亦極重視，軍事衝突徐　彬氏，於八日晨起程赴新，與中共方面代表交涉接收，如不節外生枝，或可達成新鄉小組此一命令之任務。</p>
<h3>二中全會增加整軍停戰報告</h3>
<p>〔本報重慶八日電〕據悉：二中全會於旣定報吿之外，決定增加整軍停戰情形報吿，由張委員治中報吿，中共對軍事停戰之眞實態度，由張委員羣報吿。</p>

<h3>瀋陽蘇軍開始北運　潛伏共產軍已入市內活動</h3>
<p>〔本報長春七日電〕瀋陽電話，瀋陽蘇軍已於七日起開始北運，長春蘇軍當局曾向我交涉，擬借用前經我修理之營房未遂。</p>
<p>〔本報長春七日電〕瀋陽電話，今日此間蘇軍開始北運情形下，而外圍之情勢爲（一）皇姑屯蘇軍撤走，僅留軍官二人，（二）通知我方前往接收距城南的十公里之運河鐵橋，（三）瀋陽通撫順綫蘇軍亦撤退，（四）大連亦有蘇軍兵車運瀋者。就一般現象言，蘇軍似有突然離開瀋陽或南滿之可能，於此景况下，潛伏之共軍似趨活躍，瀋陽市內已發現便衣武裝者，警察當局正謀對策中。又今日下午三時，西區前日人經營之富士電政會社發生大火，該處爲蘇軍倉庫，火光熊熊，我警察往救，爲蘇軍所阻，聞內中物資存儲頗豐云。</p>
<p>〔本報長春七日電〕今日飛來一機，經濟部一部份人員飛平，前四日飛來之機發生障故，迄今猶未修復。</p>
<h3>行總東北分署在錦設辦事處</h3>
<p>〔中央社北平八日電〕行總東北分署副署長南秉方以遼熱等省救濟工作，亟待展開，八日率該署一部職員，由平搭車赴錦，即在錦設立辦事處，就近處理各項救濟工作。關於東北來平學生之救濟，東北平津兩分署正會商辦理。又平津分署原設北平，茲為適應實際工作之需要，決於本月中旬遷至天津。</p>
<h3>共軍破壞路政</h3>
<p>〔中央社重慶八日電〕據交通界息，共軍在津浦連鎭，成立津浦鐵路管理局，派王煥章爲局長，泰安成立濟汶鐵路管理委員會，派曹星在爲主任委員，在膠濟路金嶺鎭成立濟灘段鐵路管理局派何夙池爲局長，王村成立濟灘段鐵路管理局辦事處，博山成立溜博礦區鐵路管理局，派曲臨為局長，所有路局原派各站站長，均被驅逐，由共軍另派站長接替。按組織鐵路機構及派用人員，均屬鐵路行政範圍，為政府主管部之事，任何方面不能隨便組織管理機構及委派主辦人員。</p>
<h3>會同調查張莘夫案　中蘇商談尙未獲具體結果</h3>
<p>〔中央社長春七日電〕我軍事代表團團長董彥平，今日與蘇方馬林諾夫斯基元帥參謀長德羅生柯中將，會談七小時，董氏曾提議由中蘇雙方合組調查團，會同調查張莘夫案。董氏並曾提及利用大連港口，運輸救濟物資問題，聞均無具體結果。</p>
<p>〔聯合社北平八日電〕東北大學學生五百人，昨一律着黑色制服，在此間舉行示威游行，沿途散發宣言，指斥蘇聯壓迫東北，並提出四項要求，大致與過去兩週內北平學生示威游行時所提出者相同，其中第二項爲要求澈查張莘夫遇害眞相，並迎回張君靈柩。</p>
<p>〔中央社長春八日電〕此間蘇軍當局，今上午十時對張莘夫案發表書面新聞稿。略謂：蘇軍曾在張莘夫慘案發生後捉獲。認爲有參加殺害張莘夫及其隨員嫌疑之中國人兩名唐托明及張春魁，但檢查結果，證明該二人並未參加殺害張莘夫，故已釋放，對於兇犯，據稱蘇軍常局尙在搜索中。此項活動，想係東北方面之匪帮事先準備，企圖從中挑撥，而使中蘇關係惡化者。</p>

<h3>社論　確立民主政制的規模</h3>
<p>自政治協商會議圓滿閉幕以來，很有人對「政協」所成立的協議，特別是所成立的關於修改政治體制的協議，感到憂慮。中國經過長期的抗日戰爭以來，亟需生養休息，不應再有兵禍，是舉國人民的一致要求。中國國民黨領導全民抗戰而獲致勝利，還政於民以實行憲政之治，又是它的宿願；同時其它各黨各派又在公認蔣主席爲民族領袖，服膺三民主義爲建國的最高指導原則下，準備參加實際政治。爲協調各方而的意見，於是有政治協商會議的召開。全國人民，對於這個具有歷史意義的會議的召開，曾寄予熱列的期望；而這次會議的收穫，在大體上，也實在是令人相當可以滿意的。不過，就中所成立的關於政治體制的協議，「對五五憲草」爲澈底的修正，實已拋棄了五權憲政的精義。兩院代議制度的模倣，類似責任內閣制的樹立，與夫所謂政黨政治的重行採取，凡此種種，若果將來成爲事實，不特違反了三民主義的精神，破壞了五權憲政的規模，使五十年來國民黨的努力，盡付東流，抑且將使中國政治回復到比民初情形更爲惡劣紛亂的局勢。我們應該尊重「政協」所成立的協議，那是毫無問題的事：不渦若干協議倘使中國將來的政治轉趨於紛亂，那自須於按受提付實施之前，不得不有一番審慎的考慮。</p>
<p>國民黨二中全會的召開，本報著論有所論列，曾謂：「查三民主義爲我國建國最高指導原則，原爲各黨各派所接受，則如何實行三民主義五權憲法，本應不成問題。可是這次政協會議所成立的協議，頗有違反三民主義及五權憲法的精神的。如關於五院制度及省的地位者均是，五權憲法爲國父給予中國人民之一大遣產，系列謹嚴，其目的在挽救西洋議會政治之弊，爲三民主義立一健全政治體制，不容誤會曲解。此次政協會議對憲草所爲之協議，將三民主義所欲建立的政治體制，予以支離宰割；若果付諸實施，將使五十年來國民黨的努力，盡付東流。…此次國民黨中央委員集會於陪都，希望能於接受政協成果之中，保全三民主義的精神。」一昨重慶電訊，謂國民黨二中全會八次大會席上，對政協曾作熱烈檢討，僉以各黨派旣遵奉三民主義，確認蔣主席領導建國，則對三民主義不應有所曲解。又謂「五權憲法爲國父遺敎，不容率予變更；「憲草修改原則，」必須設法糾正。。「鑒於三權分立制之缺點，及多黨內閣制之流弊，今後我國應採用五院制，總統制。」「國民大會應發揮民主精神，不應約束其權力。」凡上所言，將來如能制成決議，付諸實施，實足符本報乃至中國人民的股切期望</p>
<p>原來三民主義與五權憲法是不可以分割的，在某一意義下，五權憲法是三民主義的核心。三民主義的充分實施，必須有三民主義的政治體制，這體制就是國父所遺給我們的關於五權憲法的理論，表現在根據國父遺敎而制定的五權憲法。共產主義有它的政治體制，就是所謂蘇維埃政制。英國的內閣制，和美國的聯邦總統制都是英國和美國歷史的產物；我們無席將它們全部輸入進來，這正如我們無須輸入蘇維埃政制一樣。今各黨各派旣遵三民主義爲建國最高指導原則，自不應將五權憲法的規模予以拋棄。拋棄了五權憲法就拋棄了三民主義。國府所公布的「五五憲草」，原是立法院根據國父遺敎而制定的憲法草案，雖然經過院內外人士的再番研討，其中思慮不周的地方，似猶難免；但這裏面所擬立的制度，却是條列謹嚴自成法系。我們準備實行憲政，大家旣遵奉三民主義，將來大憲的訂立，自應以此草案爲藍本而爲必要之修正，斷不能根本予以摒棄，重新擬訂。五院制度是五權憲法精神之所寄，允不可輕易鄙棄。</p>
<p>於此，使我們想起蔣主席在二中全會紀念周席上所講的一段話：「此次全會，關係本黨之成敗與國家之存亡，各同志必須平心靜氣，認識國內外之現實環境，研究實際辦法，不可以表面片段之觀察，作憤慨空洞之議論…政治協商會議…係本黨對國家對人民負負之表現，吾人應爲國家之利益，而促其實施，惟三民主義五權憲法，爲本黨一貫奮鬥之目標，兩者實不可分離。外間有人認爲祗要承認三民主義，即可不必採用五權制度，此點實有詳加闡明之必要。憲法為國家百年大計，各同志應根據總理重要遺教，加以檢討，惟當時會議旣有所決定，吾人祗能就其犖犖大端，妥籌補救。」從而可知蔣主席對於政協在此方面所成立的協議，如何關注；如何在防止三民主義的變質。的確，防止三民主義的變質，不僅是國民黨一黨之事，實需要全國人民的共同努力。國民黨與中國民族解放運動結着歷史的深緣，而三民主義又爲國父給予中國人民的偉大遺產，凡屬國民，均有防衛三民主義之責。　確立五權憲政的規模，是中國人民的要求。我們不需要採取舶來的政制，我們要建立我們自己所獨有的民主政治體制。</p>

<h3>英商電車公司車輛昨局部恢復行駛　百貨工潮調解尙未生效　永安公司發生衝突流血</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕英商電車公司一部份職工，因張學奎等三工會理事被捕，而引起罷工風潮，至前日發展至最高潮。後經警備司令部解釋，此三人因被檢舉有附逆嫌疑，且吿發人提出相當充份之證據，故加逮捕，與工會無絲毫關係，現已解送法院，如檢察處偵查無罪，即可釋放。工人經此曉諭後，大部已明事理，昨晨紛紛赴公司辦公，一部份電車亦出廠行駛。</p>
<p>派兵駐軍保護行駛</p>
<p>然仍有一小部份職工，堅持繼續罷工，並分頭出發將已出廠之電車攔阻，因此而引起工人間小衝突數起。故七時半許，除匯山虹口兩區外，英商各路電車曾再度停駛。市警察局·淞滬警備司令部等軍警機關得訊後，即派大批警員，赴赫德路總廠，調查及勸吿復工，大部工人皆表示按受。十時一刻許，恢復行駛之每輛電車上，山警備司令部派駐憲兵兩名，以資保護。昨日計有一路·二路·三路·有軌電車二十餘輛，及無軌電車二十四路·十六路·二十餘輛恢復行駛。</p>
<p>職工代表招待報界</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕永安·新新·先施·中國國貨。麗華·中華·大新·麗安·友信·大滬，等百貨公司。因勞資糾紛釀成聯合停業。諸公司職工為報吿事件之經過與眞相起見，特於昨日下午一時半，假南京路三三四號勸工大樓三樓，招待各報記者。新新公司代表韓武成宣稱：二月廿三日勞方聲請改善待遇，提出要求十一萬六千，資方如照此辦理，每月仍有七千餘萬以上之盈利。惟雖經社會局屢次調解，仍未實行。且自七日起，自動停止營業。此項舉動，足以造成社會不安寗，社會局張振遠科長亦認爲不合，令各公司復業，資方不獨未遵其命，且宣稱如勞方再不讓步，次停業三月，且以停止供給膳食相威脅。職工方面亦表示，即六月之久，亦不屈服。但勞方代表，深願爲大局着想，決定遵照社會局裁定書所載，職員底薪六十元，助理職員五十元，練習生四十五元之議，予以考慮，然資方則仍無意談判。不過據張科長語勞方，彼可保證於五日內予以解次，一而則繼續勸導勞方復工，資方復業。</p>
<p>雙方衝突竟至流血</p>
<p>當百貨公司勞資糾紛猶未解決之時，永安公司已發生流血事件。緣永安公司新廈通往經理案之過道上，駐有職工所派巡察隊員陳祖良·王振新·朱保根。三人，昨午十二時三刻，公司總監督郭禮安命彼等離去未果，乃邀高級職員廿餘人與之交涉，引起衛突。陳祖良爲郭打下牙齒，王振新則被擊傷眼部，幸爲該公司警察白　榮所克，電吿軍警當局，由憲兵會同警察同來維持秩序。因與職工代表商談未得結果，乃將郭禮安。陳祖良。王振新·朱保根·等一併帶入警局。職工方面聞訊，羣情憤激，提出要求兩點。（一）要求公司登報向受傷職工道歡；（二）賠償醫藥費用，並保證以後不再有類似行動。</p>
<h3>「謝謝你，市長」妙哉「三字」評</h3>

<h3>潮漲水急船舶失事　江泰輪撞擊鐵駁　吊車鐵桿折斷壓下　水手乘客五人受傷</h3>
<p>招商局江泰輪，上月十四日應差駛津，昨由津返滬。中午十二時許進吳淞口，於二時二十五分，駛至中棧浦面，前有五百二十二號美驅逐艦，緩緩前駛，至前東洋公司碼頭前（即白渡橋外），該艦掉頭停泊。斯時適值漲潮，流水甚急，據熟悉航務者言，船在漲潮時掉頭，應向左繞轉，該艦突向右掉頭，江泰輪在其後隨之前進，不防其向右轉，江泰爲避免與該艦磨擦，船頭向右略移，但駕駛之視綫，又被該艦船身遮蔽。</p>
<p>江面一號浮筒，適有海關山海工程處J.M.G.之吊車鐵駁，繫於該浮筒修理，將於今日工竣。江泰待該艦行過，在後梢駛出，該鐵駁已近在咫尺，雖</p>
<p>急打倒車</p>
<p>但潮流甚急，無法避讓，該輪船頭即順流向鐵駁吊車二桿中問衝入，其力之大，不言可知。二鐵桿有一抱之大，高的二十呎，立時折斷，向江泰輪船頭甲板倒下·該甲板上有車錨機器，及吊車吊桿，</p>
<p>均被壓毀</p>
<p>船頭右舷，船邊鐵板約二尺許損壞。當時在船頭工作之水乎二名，及立於甲板上之旅客三人，均遭壓傷。其中水手一個，旅客一人，傷勢甚重，不省人事。船主劉勳達旋即放</p>
<p>汽笛呼救</p>
<p>海關港務處得訊，即派水警乘小輪趕往，一面急電救火會派救護車馳往碼頭施救，即將受傷者五人，車至上海療養醫院，二上傷勢沉重，尙未脫險。至鐵駁上修理器械，</p>
<p>大部損壞</p>
<p>但未傷人。該輪原定進口後停泊楊家渡碼頭，因出事後大船船頭套在吊車間、一時無法拆開，乃即在附近（前東洋公司）碼頭停靠。該吊桿係鋼質，異常笨重，須將其鋸斷後，船駁始可分離，至雙方之捐失，尙待調查。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕各界對中央銀行開出之外匯期貨價格，頗多推測，致引起種種誤會，本報記者特提出問題多則，詢諸該行負責人，茲將其解答分陳如下：（）一該行此次開放外匯及黃金市塲，係察酌市面情形，以平穩外匯黃金價格爲前提，此一措施，純係根據全世界最新之學說，爲世界各國所採用，確可收平穩貨幣與黃金價格之效。（二）此次該行開出外匯期貨行市，純爲便利各進出口商之貿易，以進口商而言，如向美國定貨一筆，預期可望在下月八日交貨，該進口商爲避免因匯率之變動，而影響其進口貿易之實際盈虧計，可向指定銀行交付規定之小量金額，預購四月八日期應付美匯貨款若干，以備如期付款。而售出此筆期匯之銀行，例須如數補購現匯一筆，以貯待該進口商於四月八日時前去結匯，故售出期匯之銀行，無形中即有一筆資金，投資於期匯中，在上述之例中，其投資期爲一個月，故應計給一個月之利息，以爲進口商利用銀行資金之補償。現按該行所開之期匯行市計算，所計之利息，不足月息五分，而暗息則每月達二角以上。（三）該行或其他指定銀行，如有外匯結出，申言之，即有進口貨定就待運。以日來外匯結款頻增之情形觀之，則不久即將有定購之物資，源源運來，此於平抑本國物似方面，不無小補。（四）該行所公布之美匯行市，迄未更動，對平穩匯市，已具最大之次心。又據某經濟學家觀測：該行開出四月份期匯爲二一二〇元，次非爲四月份之美匯率，將定爲二一二〇元之謂，此中除一百天爲銀行所加之利息外，無形中顯示四月份之美匯率，將不致較現行之電匯率爲高。若以期現兩匯率拔開之狹小及所加利息之低微而言，則月份之匯率，實有再低廉之可能云。</p>

<h3>教部推進電化教育　本年內擬成立五個工作隊</h3>
<p>〔本報重慶專訊〕敎育部對電化敎育，素極注重，曾辦有中華敎育電影製片廠，已製成敎育影片四十八部，同時並與英美電影新聞處聯絡，利用影片，實施電化敎育。在本年內，擬成立電化敎育工作隊五隊，上半年決先成立兩隊，一隊留在首都，隨時在附近各地施行電化敎育，另一隊則爲出發遠處施敎之用。最近蔣主席又有手諭，令擬首次五年電化敎育實施計畫，及民衆敎育電影計畫，敎部已在擬具計畫之中。聞電化敎育，將實施普遍時，敎部可自有敎育廣播電台，無諭紀念週或上課及娛樂時間，皆可播音，隨時可聽名人演講。並以播音代民衆敎育，而民衆敎育電影實施時，則所有電影院，一律改良，其各地電影院管轄權雖仍操之於社會局，而指導權則屬於敎育行政機關。如此則督學亦可視察電影院，視察其所放映電影，是否合於民衆敎育，有無違背及不合民衆衛生之處，皆可指導糾正。電化敎育，將多方促進云。（安）</p>
<p>教育影片由渝運京</p>
<p>〔本報南京訊〕教部為推行電化教充，已由在渝社會司主管電化敎育之第三科科長杜維濤，主任楊汝熊，携帶敎育電影製片廠所製之敎育影片卞二部，於四日來京，到部辦公。聞電化敎育工作將從此展開。（愚）</p>
<p>美各學校放映電影</p>
<p>〔紐約電訊第二次世〕界大戰武裝部隊訓練之迅速，引起各種新的敎授方法，其中最有效者，爲有聲電影。因此向武裝部隊施敎之教育影片，現正移用於學校。現美國四十八州各學校皆普遍利用有聲電影，作爲敎授之工具，在課室中放映影片之前，先由敎師描述各生將見到之事物，然後再由學生發問，如此電影不但帮助理解，且可引導創造性之計劃與補充讀物，但敎師仍處於重要地位。</p>
<h3>青年復學就業</h3>
<p>各省市設立輔導處</p>

<h3>哈爾濱大學生　無校可入</h3>
<p>〔中央社哈爾濱七日電〕僞滿時代於此間設有哈爾濱醫大，農大，工大三校。八一五光復後，工大已由中長鐵路接牧復課，一切課本均改俄文，中國學生因語言不通，皆陷無校可入之境。農大，醫大，雖由哈市府盡力維持，因損壞均重，不堪復課。所有學生，除一小部赴北平投學外，餘均待補習，希望敎部早日舉辦。</p>
<h3>改革日本教育　美敎育國到日協助</h3>
<p>〔聯合社東京八日電〕美國知名敎育二十八人，前應麥帥之請，組織敎育視察國來此，協助改革日本敎育。該團今日與日本敎育界代表三十人，舉行首次聯席會議，日本文部省大臣阿部，於會議席上演說稱：日本願與視察團合作，擬定一「自由的」敎育改革計劃，並希望能以「忍耐」精神，解決日本敎育問題。</p>

<h3>雷克在聊城受驚　自謂如蠻荒探險</h3>
<p>魯西聊城，彼共軍圍困日久，城內軍民煤糧俱缺，情形嚴重。濟南執行小組雷克上校等一行，特於二十四日乘汽車由濟南駛赴該地調處，往返四日，已於二士七日下午五時返抵濟南。</p>
<p>濟南執行小組雷克上校，政府代表涂叙五，中共代表鄭任農，偕政府二十集團軍參謀長阮建華，中共魯軍區外事處處長黃遠，及翻譯汪溪等，由濟南乘吉普汽車一輛出發。雷克上校自任司機，公路雖極坎坷，卒因駕駛技術精練，直駛北行。下午過齊河西北行，約六十里，抵朱莊，已人共軍範圍。汽車正行近朱莊時，突然槍聲一鳴，子彈空中飛行，即有大隊共軍由莊內聲擁而出，車即憂然停止，被共軍所包圍，一時情勢嚴重，如臨大敵。雷克上校亦以事出意外，乃下車連聲大呼：「我是美國武官雷克上校」。中共方面　黃二人，均下車向包圍之共軍竭力解說，始悉該莊駐有共軍朱經武部一團，因誤認爲敵人，故而有此一度　擾，歷半小時，汽車始得通行。雷克上校笑云：「此行道路如此不平，遭遇又時出不意，眞不亞於　荒探險！」下午五時抵窩唐縣，當有共方縣長解金聲，率軍民列隊歡迎，雷氏等偕至縣府休息，接見民衆代表，多半携訴狀控吿漢奸者。</p>
<p>雷氏於二十六日上午九時，接見聊城民衆代表，立於汽車上向羣衆演說，大意謂：中國國民黨也好，共產黨也好，現在經政府各方決定共軍改編二十個師，國軍爲九十個師，統爲　家的軍隊。先是敵人，後來就是良友。希望中國不要再分化自己的力量，共同集合全力，來建設一個新的現代國家。美國情願以對日作戰所準備未用的武器，來協助中國足够裝備）百一十一個師所用，使每個軍人，都有自動步槍，且有一〇五生的口徑的大砲，唐克車。本人在東北甚久，深知爲中國之東北，蘇聯早應遵約撤兵，因爲中國和平，即爲世界和平奠定基礎。所以本人犧牲了個人在美國物質的享受，來為中國和平努力等語。至晚，風雪交加，至二十七日始晴，九時半離城，冒寒歸來，已午後五時。</p>
<p>……本報二十七日航訊　何冰如寄……</p>
<h3>一片征塵出潼關</h3>
<p>— 范鴻寄</p>
<p>本報二月二十日河南航訊</p>
<p>上重慶難，在重慶生活難，離開重慶更難。記者幸獲各方協助，在重慶過了四個多月，又在無定期的持久等候中，獲得到西安的飛機座位，不能不算是大幸。飛行的前夕，得戰地服務團戚良羽先生招待住宿，免除白市驛等機的種種困難，益使內心感到無限的安慰和溫暖，兼增加了赴華北採訪的次心。</p>
<p>西安行程</p>
<p>十二日晨，飛機開始起飛，這一日的天氣，萬里時空，陽光斜照，是低空飛行最理想的天氣。機內開放着暖氣管，宛若春天一般，人們都露出喜悅的面孔，伴着嗒嗒的馬達聲，靜候着飛機的前進。航行穩妥迅速，兩小時就到達西安機場，是歷來飛仃所僅見的。</p>
<p>出了飛機，人們把一個大擔都放了下來，順着刺人面手的西北風，迎着正空的和暖陽光，吐出了一口舒適的長氣。</p>
<p>坐上汽車進城，車輪軋起的灰　，眾滿了車後的街道，更無情的洛在路上每個人的頭上和身上我們開始進人西安了，西安是一個古老的國都，在西北高原上，雖然是荒凉，但還够偉大。高而闊的城樓，寬闊的街道，古朽的老樹，敦厚樸實的民風，都給你一個絕對不同的新印象，不客氣的說：西安在全國各大城市中，有點太落伍。</p>
<p>此間女人旗袍蓋住脚，男人沒有西裝革履。口紅，高跟，幾乎絕跡。理髮廳，影戲院，「馬虎」之至。皮鞋店，百貨店，貨樣不全，也不炫人，跳舞廳根本沒有。如果出現一個燙髮和高跟的女郎，會引起很多人的注意，有些落伍女性還追她們到襄面看一看。</p>
<p>西安的大館子不多，江浙粵湘京滬的更少，妓院亦多，其原因據說是旅館太少，旅客太多之故。其實旅館並不少，統計在百家以上，而旅客之多，確是事實，但游資充斥，娛樂不進步，也是促使妓女存在增多的一個主要原因。</p>
<p>西安的報紙，有西京日報，正報，靑年日報，西北文化日報，益世報，秦風工商聯合版，西京平　，華北新聞，新秦晚報，經濟快報等數家，正報銷路最廣。雜誌除「高原月刊」外，無其他可見。西安文化界極苦悶，文化工作無發展，新聞人員無保障，新聞工作實難於發展。</p>
<p>一般的物價，比之重慶，算得上低，低得有五分之一到三分之一，不過質上量上都太差。所以與其說西安物價便宜，例還不如說生活低劣。西安保有古都之風，次不是豪華驕奢的都市，靡靡之音是聽不到的。聽到的，却是暗中不自由的呌苦呌屈。</p>
<p>西安也許是地方太大了，　得人少，房少，機關少，政治的成績還不大顯著。不過當局很有一番苦幹的次心，對於一切都有遠大的眼光和計劃。將來西安甚至陝西，也許能成爲進步的地區。</p>
<p>記者到西安停了一週，過了元宵節後就繼續踏上自已的旅程。</p>
<p>隴海踏勘</p>
<p>西安一週過後，就搭上隴海車東行。隴海路是戰時國內僅存的唯一鐵路，它担負起抗戰的大任，又繼續了復員的艱辛，爲中國出盡了不小的力氣。現在的隴海綫西邊可以通到天水，東邊可以通到陝州，（售票僅至潼關），陝州至洛陽正在趕修，預計五月底可以完成。洛陽到鄭州可以直達，鄭州到開對，有二路可行：一條搭輕便車，循舊黃河鐵橋至新鄉，轉車東行。一綫由中牟過黃河，搭車東行。前者需二日，後者需一日。開封以東通徐州。徐州以東自上月十四日爲共軍破壞後，迄今已斷絕至連雲港的路錢。這是赴華北人民最感痛恨的一件事。</p>
<p>由西安到潼關每日有三車，票價三等到潼關六百九十元，二等加一倍，頭等再加一倍。東來旅客沿路下車的很少，到潼關的佔全數百分之九十。有些旅客，買不到票，是上車後補的。人們艱苦的過了八年抗戰生活，坐車是不允許再選擇的，把身子放上不走路就行，把行李放上不　就行，還談什麼要坐要臥要舒適嗎？車上一切已經是比過去降了等，加上乘客的擁集，除了空氣汚濁，行動拘束，坐臥無處的諸種難受之外，是沒有一點享受的。　東行的客人，西安寳鷄都有聯運處辦理聯運登記，每處二十人，可以省去到潼關等車的麻煩，登記者除具有軍公人員證件外，有人事關係者更快一點，但弊病和不平已經沒有，較飛機登記更進步公正萬分。</p>
<p>記者十一點半到潼關，留在軍上睡到天明才出站，這也是給旅客一關方便，</p>
<p>潼關透視</p>
<p>潼關面河背山，負風陵渡之鋒，是國人盡知的天險地區。戰時曾抵擋了敵人的進犯，但吃砲彈最多的要算是潼關了。滿城殘垣斷壁，沒有人烟　馬雜草，十足表示牠戰時所受創痕的痛深。爲國家幾乎犧牲掉牠整個的生命。</p>
<p>潼關西關靠車站的地方，是一個新興的街道。過去火車來往陝豫，曾經繁盛一時，待鐵路通車，洛陽西安便奪去了牠的地位，到了現在牠才重新成了陝豫旅客的必經之所，所以一切都是爲旅客所設置的。</p>
<p>使你想像不到的是：街上都很新鮮，旅館十之八九是才蓋成的。房間小而矮，價格每間有四百，五百，八百等數種，被褥每條一百五，算是相當的貴。吃食也比西安貴，一盤菜不下三百元，窮人多食稀飯饅頭度日。小小的一條街，不到半里長，却有很多的花樣，比得上都市。</p>
<p>菜市的後邊也有不少的玩藝，等於重慶的較塲口，那裏有賣藝的，賣藥的，測字算命的，唱戲的，說書的，五花八門，很够閒人玩味。過了那個範圍便是河灘，你可以到黃河邊上去欣賞一下那浪濤奔騰晝夜湍流的黃河，望啓被敵人佔據了多年的風陵渡，大好河山，急待整理，令人無限感憤。　聯運處站在火車站的後邊，車子座位的分配，是軍人佔百分之五十，公敎人員百分之三十，平民百分之二十。票價至洛陽是六千五百三十元，只賣長途到洛陽。（共二百六十一公里，每公里計二十五元。）每天開出車輛七輛，隴海及聯運處聯遝旅客車各二輛，全爲卡車，間有數重棚子草，仍無坐位。</p>
<p>每日到潼關的旅客，以火車三趙計，的六千人。除有百分之十到由風陵渡過河到山西外，至少還有五千人要東行，代步工具大馬車，有三馬四馬拖拉者，呌啦啦車，每車載重二千餘斤，每日均有三十餘輛開行，要五六天到洛陽，但可以多裝行李，可以不在潼關高生活下焦急的久等。膠輪人拉車呼爲架子車，多爲短途，價格不定，步行的也很多。由潼關北渡的，每日約二三十船。多循小路至太原，最快者八天到幷。</p>
<p>潼關城內有申報等代售處，有西安各報的駐邊訪員。縣級工作異常沉悶，每日早晨九時至下午四時爲上班時間，都是照例的公事。新政和建設工作地點也看不見。善後救濟總署晉察綏分署第一工作也在城內，正在着手籌備中。（二月二十日）</p>
<p>美軍將作原子彈試驗之地點</p>
<h3>原子彈轟炸戰艦　將分作三次實驗</h3>
<p>一九四六年五月及七月，美軍在中太平洋馬紹爾羣島之比基尼島，將作二次原子彈轟炸戰艦之實騐。此二次試騐，對未來海上戰鬥力將有所決定。原子彈一一枚，將炸毀海上目標物一百個。其中三十五個係日德及其他他艦艇，種類自潛艇至母艦，戰艦，應有盡有，參加試騐者，達二萬人。</p>
<p>美國聯合參謀部，業已選定白蘭第海軍中將爲第一聯合特種艦隊司令，第一次試騐中，B2型超空堡壘，將自瓜雅林啓飛，離目標物數百呎擲下原子彈一枚，艾尼咸吐克及其他半徑二百哩以內之壞狀珊瑚島，均將首先撤退。第二枚原子彈，定於七月一日擲下，目標物爲艦艇若干艘，第三深水實騐，或將於一九四七年舉行。</p>
<p>（上）美艦賓夕爾凡尼亞號，係美國之旗艦，亦將成爲一個轟炸目標中之一個。</p>
<p>（中）美艦紐約號，將爲本年五月及七月舉行之原子彈實駝目標之一，其他目物包括美戰艦河　基斯號，拿伐達號，母艦薩拉吐加號獨立號，驅逐艦十六艘，艇潛八艘，德國大型巡洋艦猶根皇子號，日戰艦永戶號，及小型巡洋艦佐川號。</p>
<p>（下）另一轟炸止標，爲日戰艦永戶號。（美譯）</p>
<h3>海上重逢舊雨情深　空軍隊長毛尙貞　加緊訓練滬空動員</h3>
<p>上海江灣機塲是中美空軍在滬主要基地，每天飛機起落，像荒山懸岩附近蒼鷹起落一樣多。馬歇爾·柏德生·魏德邁·都曾在這裏降落過，又飛掉，江灣機場永遠有不斷的人與車馬在流走，成了上海人視綫所集中的一個焦點。</p>
<p>在二公里範圍的軍營區域裏，中國空軍第一聯隊第一大隊的駐滬部隊，第二中隊隊長是毛尙貞，坐在辦公桌旁‘從早至暮在解決紛紛而來的問題。</p>
<p>出戰廿二次</p>
<p>毛尙貞隊長，疲長條兒，大眼睛，不大看人，在笑的時候，也垂着眼皮。他在航校學成飛行按術後，即在部隊裏作戰，駕蘇聯喀求莎飛機，駕B25型。一年之中，以四川梁山爲基地，他們第二中隊炸遍了武漢至鄭州新鄕，間的平漢鐵路沿綫日軍軍事目標。他本人即領機出發二十二次，最艱苦一次，為去年四月十二日炸鄭州黃河鐵橋。敵人在鐵橋上佈置了密如珠網的高射砲陣地。鐵橋是炸中二孔，橋　崩斷了，但他們全部飛機都打得像蜜聲窩一樣。一架B25型永沒有回來。</p>
<p>精銳轟炸機</p>
<p>空軍第一大隊原本是中國空軍裏精銳的轟炸部隊。現任大隊長吳壗陳少校，即為一年出發轟炸敵陣三十次以上的老戰士。陸軍裏的作戰，到團畏級即很少有機會直接戰鬥，多半在第一綫工事裏，或者在推進途中担任指揮之責。可是空軍不然，越是職位高越是要親冒彈雨與危險，飛在先頭領導全個部隊前進戰鬥。第一聯隊司令徐煥昇氏，就是一個有名的親冒彈雨與各種危險的戰鬥領導人。</p>
<p>空勤受訓員</p>
<p>目前第一大隊，正在使一部戰鬥員改飛空運機。在中國最先來的美國空運機，為C47，運輸量爲每機四千五百磅。在中國內地被封鎖的初期，C47型機，運輸不小精貴的必需軍用品到中國來。後來，空運物資要求提高，C47型機落伍了，（但在客運上仍然是最好的飛機，可坐三十客。比戰前十四座的運輸機大。）一種被稱爲C46型的空運機漸多，此項飛機可裝八千五百磅物資，也是雙發動機。第一大隊駐滬部隊在江灣，正由毛尙貞隊長負責C46型空運機訓練的工作。</p>
<p>訓練實施法</p>
<p>這些在滬受訓空勤員，都是一大隊老戰士。第一批五組，由美空軍施以訓練，先由飛機講解入手，然後作飛機性能飛行。（在飛行中感覺領會該種飛機性能。）接上作正常起落，作單發動機起洛。（萬一雙發動機懷了一個，用一個也可以起或降落。（作使用器飛行，接上個側風起落，短場起落，（萬一你找不到規定起落的機場。找到小機場，也可起落。）最後載重起落，臨了來一次長途載重飛行。全部訓練時間二十小時，一個轟炸機飛行員總是被改造空運機飛行員訓練完成。</p>
<p>空運保安隊到東北，送調部小組人員視察前綫與鐵路，裝給養到交通中斷的小村落。這一切都可以做得十分週到。</p>
<p>舊雨喜相逢</p>
<p>毛尙貞隊長在滬三個月中，已把若干組這種訓練完成。打仗似乎成了夢一般消逝了。的烟影。當年在梁山那個萬山叢中，毛隊畏在我隨B23型出發轟炸平漢鐵路鐵橋時，他敎我保險傘的用法，危險的應變技術，那些事全過去了。現在，在車如流水馬如龍的上海，在衣食住行完全近代化的上海，舊雨重逢，喝一杯電爐煮出的咖啡，看着燒在火爐木柴的紅光，買恍如隔世。</p>
<p>獨身老青年</p>
<p>由戰鬥到空運，空軍部隊裏的沉重負担，毫未因戰爭時代轉到和平時代向有所改變。毛尙貞出航校八年了，熬受戰爭苦難八了，他把自已變成三十二歲獨身老靑年。歲月流走了，他小小行囊中，只裝了幾塊花彩的銅與鐵。那是華　獎章一座，（指定爲黃河鐵橋之役的勛獎）一等與二等宣　獎章各一座，三等空軍復興勛章一座，據他自己告記者說：愛吃好的香煙，愛吃咖啡，愛在冬季　火，愛與一羣同命運的年靑小夥子，聚集撩天。每天淸晨六時起身，夜九點談天的戰友散去，他一人處理隊務，至十二時就寢。　聽說這隊長怏成家啦，他指一張照片說：「我倒很歡喜她！」（朱民威。）</p>

<h3>論「也罷」</h3>
<p>— 小山</p>
<p>中國舊劇裏，有一句非常普通，又非常緊要的『台詞』，就是『也罷』。</p>
<p>問題不在『也罷』這兩個字的本意，而在『也罷』的『跨越性』，演劇者一唸也罷之後，常致劇悄遽變，有新的發展，新的演出。</p>
<p>比方賽爾墩拿回了雙銅，還要向黃大　翻臉算舊賬，經朱光祖開誠佈公地一說，忽然大澈大悟，來一個斬釘截鐵，剛毅明朗的『也……罷！』底下就沖出一句『兩家的怨仇一筆勾！』握手言歡，利平重光。</p>
<p>比方莫成見了主人死禍臨頭，不禁熱淚橫流，拼出一個千鈞一髮的『也……罷』來，一死以報！劇情於是大轉。</p>
<p>『也罷』的產生，是非常吃力的。演劇至此，只見演者瞪住眼珠，握緊拳頭，提起嗓子，『也』是奪口而出，長而且冲，把尾子吊成『飛音』，再將兩唇一閉，脚一蹬，頭一點，逼出一個短促而沈重的『罷』來，同時『場面』點子一跥，大羅一『鏘』，把空氣拉得緊張得透不過氣來。劇人的『做功』臻於此，觀衆的情緒集於此，劇情的最高潮也止於此。</p>
<p>所以，『也罷』在劇人口吻中是一個轉機，一個表示，也是一個『決心』。山窮水盡疑無路，一經『也罷』，就又轉入『柳暗花明又一村』了！</p>
<p>不少具有劇情常識的觀衆，是能測計『也罷』來蹤的，此劇，此情，此時，此地，『也罷』應該出口了，他們觀察得十分淸楚。</p>
<p>糟糕的是：大家都在伸着勃子，等候台上來個『也罷』來個新的表情，新的決心，新的作風，新的設施，但演者仍是慢吞吞的在那裘舞『水袖』，唱『迴龍』，一貫老調兒，觀衆怎不掃興？</p>
<p>因此，儀態萬千的『也罷』，也就變質而另有所解了：『算了吧！』</p>
<p>觀衆喝個滿堂彩：『不唱也罷！』</p>

<h3>宇宙間生命微渺</h3>
<p>— 鋼人</p>
<p>看，星體在運行，江河在奔騰，一切的一切，告訴我們，偉大的宇宙是多麼的調諧，世界是多少的有生氣，並且這一切調諧，偉大，有生氣，都在有生命的世界上表現出來。使我們體騐到空間的廣大，時間的永恒，戀念過去的宇宙，而展望着未來的世界。</p>
<p>『原子能』使我們得到無上的動力，『雷達』將使我們得到典月球的連繫，更增加了生命世界的動人，展開了人類無限的希望。</p>
<p>生命可說是一切生動的主宰，是如此的重要，那末這宇宙裏有多少生命的世界呢？一從古代傳說及神話裏，可知一百代對生命存在之處認爲極多，但這些，祇是傳說和神話而已。</p>
<p>近代天文物理學告訴我們，空間如此大，星體如此多，但生命世界卻少得可憐。</p>
<p>我們所見的星體，其表面溫度已在一千六百度至三萬度之間，如此高熱，分子存在亦不可能，在這擾動極述的原子圈中，誰也不信存在着生命罷！何况包團在外的空間溫度在華氏零下四百六十度，存在生命，簡直是不可能的。但天文學家告訴我們除太陽系外，宇宙中都是如此；要求迪合於生命所需的物理條件——過當的溫度如液體環境，宇宙中僅有一千萬萬萬分之一而已。</p>
<p>在僅有的太陽系中，太陽表面達六千度，生命存在殆不可能。而圍繞其外的九大行星中，捨地球上有生侖外，海王星，冥王星距太陽過遠，成爲一冰結硬塊；水星又因距日太近，成爲沸騰的一團，都沒有存在生命的希望。木星，土星，天王星上溫度均在零下一百五十至一百七十度之間，內在熟能缺乏，僅靠太陽光，不足維持生命；且亦無海洋等水之存在，遍地冰雪，生命是不能存在的。</p>
<p>金星上溫度雖較近地球溫度，但日間炎熱異常，晚間又突降至零下七十五度，即有生命，亦難適應吧！</p>
<p>至於火星，渦去認爲與地球相似，自轉一周所需時間，亦與地球相似（僅差數分），而二極溫度在零下九十至一百二十度間，赤通溫度約四十度，口觀察得有運河交叉，氣候變化，最有可能存在生命，但在百吋天文鏡中看來使人失望，前所認爲氣候變化，運河交叉等，可說是沙漠等狂變形成，因此，至少有意識的生命缺乏存在的實據，然而必要推測別處有生命，火星上比較可能而已。</p>
<p>可貴的生命之花，卻以非常偶然的機會，怒放在這適合生命的地球上，由有意識的人類來測量和研究這宇宙，努力地去揭開一切物理宇宙的神秘，這是多有意味的事。</p>
<p>宇宙問生命稀有旣是如此，人類怎可以不互求福利，携手向前進呢？</p>

<p>『中國人眞弄不好』一句話，近來不知怎樣，在社會上普遍的流行着。讀者們大概也曾聽到。說得不客氣一些，也許你也說過吧？我們今日試不妨就這句話的妥當與吾，有意義嗎，來作一個客觀的評價。據我個人分析，說這句話的人，其心理固大部由於耳聞目睹社會上許多不平的事實，腐敗的道德，或政府不當的措施，自己沒有辦法，而來一聲長嘆；但是同時必具有二種心理：其一是中國人眞弄不好，但大家像我一樣必弄得好，我才是中國最具希望的人，另一是表示中國人已失望了，無論如何弄不好了，即使我個人努力也是徒然的了。總之，無論它其含什麼意義，它總是一句消極話，而絕不會有積極意義的。奇怪的是，它雖是這樣流行，我却從沒有聽見主席說過，或其他社會上賢達說過。我以爲即使中國人現在是不好，但也絕對不應該說：『中國人眞弄不好』。因爲不好了，你就希望他永違不好渦去嗎？你就不想設法把他弄好嗎？再進一步說，我們口口聲聲說中國人眞弄不好，我們是不是也是中國人，我們自己弄好了嗎？不錯，也許中國人是弄不好，但中國人爲什麼會弄不好呢？我們有沒有下過一番研究？所以，與其說中國人眞弄不好，還不若說：中國人爲什麼弄不好』？一句來得妥當。不然，若是大家永遠消極地喊『中國人眞弄不好』，中國也許眞的不會好了。但是，於少我們都是希望中國弄好的。</p>

<h3>早春晨光好</h3>
<p>— 溯因</p>
<p>朝陽的光輝照耀著晨空，在沉寂的空氣中傳來了一二聲鷄啼和細碎的島鳴。啊，這是一個多麼明凈，靜謐的早春的早晨喲！雖然空氣還是相當的冷峭，但這正是早春所特有的一種表徵——淸澈，靜肅。在這麼幽美的晨光裹，我們正談帶着孩子到戶外去，迎接早春的來臨，讓淸澈的晨風洗去我們夜來的濁氣，讓我們萎靡的心靈受著朝氣的振刷。</p>
<p>可是有許多沒福消受的懶蟲們正在擁被高臥，他們不理會幼小孩子要求起身的呼喊。窗子關得緊緊的，簾幕遮得重重的，唯恐那清新的空氣，輝耀的陽光透了進來。他們呼吸着被窩，帳帷中的惡濁空氣，拘禁在殘留著隔夜景象的斗室中，和外面的景象形成了一個仳界：外面是早春的晨光，明麗而生氣充沛：裏面卻是夜來的陰沈，灰　而死氣沉沉！裏面的人意識不到這是另一天的開始，夢　猶纏繞在他們的心頭，他們還是隔夜的人物。</p>
<p>可憐的懶蟲們，你們太蠢愚了！你們以為『胭宴朝』是幸福吧？但聽明的太陽在嘆息。他把寳貴的陽光，春天的生氣賞賜給你們，滿望你們會好好地領受他的慈惠，像大地上其他一切烏蟲，花木等一樣，使你們生意盎然，活力培增。但你們竟是這麼蠢愚，像一條蟄伏的懶蛇一樣輾轉在被高裏。</p>
<p>祇有農人們是最幸福的。他們在晨曦朦朧中就起來迎接光明的來臨，他們浴著晨光，吸著清氣，耕耘者，收穫著，把黃金般的給世人。工作，陽光，空氣使他們健康，愉快。</p>

<h3>Government Reorganization Under Discussion: Second Plenary Session to Make Preliminary Decision</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Chongqing Eighth Dispatch] The issue of government reorganization is still under deliberation, and no formal lists have been submitted by any party. Wu Dingchang, representing the government, exchanged opinions with all parties the day before yesterday. Various parties are in a wait-and-see state, all awaiting the outcome of the Second Plenary Session before deciding on candidates to participate in the government. Therefore, the government reorganization currently has majority support, with only insistence on the Five-Power Constitution in the draft constitution chapter. As for personnel matters within the government, there are also various rumors. According to information obtained from various sources, changes are indeed expected in the government's departmental personnel, and there will also be organizational adjustments. It is possible that the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Food will be merged. The organization of the Ministry of Interior will definitely be expanded, and a preliminary decision will be made by the Second Plenary Session. Once coordination with all parties is completed, it will be announced, and the government's candidates can then be formally decided.</p>
<p>[United Press Chongqing Eighth Dispatch] It is rumored in the temporary capital today that a large National Government council will be formed by the end of this month, but the forty members plan to resign en masse before the council is formed. Many members of the Central Executive Committee consistently believe that the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference made excessive concessions to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and other parties, and have therefore continuously criticized them. However, Chairman Chiang insisted on adoption, which is expected to be approved by the Second Plenary Session. Since the convening of this plenary session on March 1, the government itself and several important officials, such as Foreign Minister Wang, have been directly criticized. Several members accused the government of mishandling the takeover of Northeast China and were dissatisfied with Xiong Shihui, the director of the Northeast Headquarters, advocating for his removal and replacement by Minister of Military Administration Chen Cheng. Furthermore, Premier Song Ziwen of the Executive Yuan, in his initial report on the political and economic situation at the Second Plenary Session today, stated: After the implementation of the new foreign trade regulations, concrete results can be seen in two months, great achievements in four months, and the economic foundation can be declared stable by the end of this year.</p>
<h3>Premier Song Reports on Political and Economic Situation: Will Not Shirk Responsibility, But Must Reflect on the Past and Plan for the Future</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Chongqing Eighth Dispatch] The tenth meeting of the Second Plenary Session was held on the eighth. Apart from the transportation report, most of the time was spent in a heated review of the political report. The meeting began at 3:20 PM, with 203 members in attendance, chaired by Committee Member He Yingqin. First, Zhang Daofan, representing the presidium, reported that the presidium had received a temporary motion from 110 members regarding the National Assembly issue in the Political Consultative Conference report. He was designated to explain it on behalf of the presidium. After he finished reading the explanation, the proposer believed that since the presidium had explained the case in detail, there was no need to put it to a discussion, and automatically withdrew it. The chairman, according to the agenda, announced the review of the political report. However, Premier Song Ziwen was not present at the time due to other business, so the transportation issue was brought forward for reporting. Minister of Transportation Yu Feipeng reported on railways, highways, shipping, ships, and postal and telecommunications. He finished at 4:40 PM. After the break, the review of politics began. The speakers included Lü Yunzhang, Hu Shuhua, Ma Yuanfang, Yuan Yong, Li Zonghuang, Luo Gonghua, Hu Qiuyuan, Huang Yuren, and Zhong Tianxin. The focus of the review was still on personnel systems, administrative efficiency, and economic and financial issues. Later, Premier Song himself responded separately. The Secretariat announced the list of members of the Political Report Review Committee. The conveners were Li Wenfan, Gu Zhenglun, and Fan Yushui. The Ninth Session of the Plenary session convened again on the 9th in both the morning and the afternoon, and adjourned at 6:15 pm.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Chongqing Eighth Dispatch] The ninth meeting of the Second Plenary Session was held on the morning of the eighth. Premier Song Ziwen of the Executive Yuan gave a political report, the original text of which is as follows: Chairman, fellow comrades, I have been instructed today to give a political report. The political aspect includes many departments. The Executive Yuan has already printed general work reports and distributed them to all comrades for review. The main departments, such as foreign affairs, economics, and finance, have also been reported orally at the conference by the responsible comrades of each department. What I am reporting today is the most urgent and serious issue at the moment, and it is also the issue that everyone is most concerned about, which is the economic issue. It can be said that everyone is dissatisfied with the current economic situation. This is inevitable. Even I, personally, feel that not only am I not satisfied, but I am also one of the most dissatisfied people. However, I absolutely do not mean to shirk responsibility. Now, I am reporting the facts to all comrades. History teaches us that without the past, there cannot be the present, and without the present, there cannot be the future. Therefore, to talk about the economic situation, we must reflect on the past, understand the present, and then plan for the future.</p>
<p>Coping with the Final Battle: Expenditures are Increasing Daily</p>
<p>I was appointed to take charge of the Executive Yuan on December 4th of the 33rd year of the Republic [1944]. At that time, the Japanese army was advancing towards Guiyang. It was the most dangerous stage of our War of Resistance. At that time, unfortunately, we continued to lose Henan and Hunan. Henan, which produces wheat, and Hunan, which produces rice, were both the most important food supply areas in the rear. Furthermore, we successively lost most of Guangdong and Guangxi, cutting off the connection between the rear and the southeastern provinces. The area of financial revenue had been reduced to relying only on Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, and other provinces. At the same time, we had to urgently mobilize troops, deploy defenses, recruit new soldiers, replenish vacancies, and dispatch all kinds of materials to cope with the final battle. Expenditures inflated day by day, and revenues decreased day by day. The dangerous situation was truly at its extreme. In the spring of the 34th year of the Republic [1945], the situation stabilized slightly. The Allied forces achieved victories on all fronts, and the National Army was actively preparing for a counteroffensive. Military expenditures became even more enormous. At that time, all parties believed that the treatment of soldiers was too poor and that the troops could not be fully fed. Therefore, military expenditures had to be increased several times. However, revenues could not be increased. Under these difficult circumstances, the government, in order to achieve victory, could almost be said to be coping with the current situation bare-handed, and could only rely on issuing banknotes to make up for the insufficient revenue. This situation naturally caused prices to soar. We also all know that since the beginning of the War of Resistance, the enemy occupied our country's economic key points, and we relied on issuing currency to compensate for year-by-year accumulation. The gap between revenue and expenditure increased day by day, and at the same time, the area using legal tender shrank day by day. The magnitude of this danger was clear to everyone. Fortunately, the people of the whole country were able to deeply understand the righteousness and endure all the hardships of wartime, and thus achieved the day of victory in the War of Resistance. However, we must pay attention to the fact that although the War of Resistance was victorious and the war was over, the material and personnel losses and financial damage suffered during such a long period of resistance have led to the economic difficulties we face today.</p>
<p>The Economies of Britain and France Faced Similar Difficulties After the War</p>
<p>We must understand that economic difficulties often do not manifest during wartime, but are realized after the end of the war. The situation after the First World War is still fresh in our memory. The economic shock after this great war was naturally even more severe than the first. Let us look at France. French industry was almost completely undamaged by the Germans, because after Germany occupied France, it also used French industry to manufacture military equipment. Furthermore, Germany surrendered before Japan. However, today, France's economic difficulties have reached an extreme. Take Britain as another example. British territory was never occupied by the enemy, and yet, due to economic factors, even after the war ended, rations were still distributed by head count. Furthermore, the nutrition enjoyed by the British people today is even lower than it was during wartime. Our country has undergone eight years of resistance, and the damage suffered is heavier than in any other country. It is like a person who has been ill for a long time, who cannot be cured by a single dose of medicine, nor can health be restored in a day or two.</p>
<p>Four Main Reasons for Our Country's Economic Instability</p>
<p>Speaking of the reasons for our country's economic instability, there are of course many, but the main ones are no more than the following four:</p>
<p>First, all important materials were consumed over a long period during the War of Resistance, coupled with the enemy's blockade. Although there were airlifted supplies, the transportation capacity was ultimately limited. On average, less than 1,000 tons of civilian materials were transported to the country each month. As for the enemy's plunder in the occupied areas, and because production decreased, materials were also extremely scarce. Therefore, the supply of materials nationwide could not be balanced, and prices naturally rose.</p>
<p>Second, during the War of Resistance, the rear area shrank, and revenues naturally decreased, while expenditures increased day by day. The government relied on increasing issuance to compensate. Therefore, the more issuance, the higher the prices, and the more government expenditures increased, so it had to increase issuance again, thus creating a cyclical cause and effect. By the time the war ended and the occupied areas were recovered one by one, the increase in income had not yet been realized, while the expenditure on recovery was very large, requiring more issuance, and the stimulus to prices was therefore particularly profound.</p>
<p>Third, in terms of transportation, due to the long-term war, the enemy's destruction, and the economic blockade, transportation equipment gradually decreased, and the efficiency of transporting materials also declined day by day, almost reaching a state of complete stagnation. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Military Mediation Department Strictly Orders Rehe Communist Troops to Withdraw from Pingquan Yingli: Executive Group Arrives in Pingquan and Ceasefire is Announced</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] San Francisco Eighth Broadcast says: The Beiping Mediation Executive Department today formally issued an ultimatum to the Communist troops in southern Rehe, demanding that the Communist troops withdraw one hundred miles north of Pingquan in southern Rehe to the area northwest of Chifeng. If the Communist troops do not accept the order, they will bear the responsibility for starting a civil war. After the release of this order by the Mediation Executive Department, students from universities in the Northeast studying in Beiping held another anti-Soviet demonstration, demanding that the government immediately demand that the Soviet Union return the nine northeastern provinces.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Jinzhou Seventh Dispatch] Chief of Staff of the Northeast Security Command Headquarters, General Zhao Jiaxiang, returned to Jinzhou from Beiping yesterday. Zhao was summoned to Beiping by Du [Yuming] on the fourth to discuss important matters. His main task was to handle the matter of the Communist troops in Rehe not complying with the agreement to cease conflict and openly capturing Pingquan. Zhao met with Zheng Jiemin, the central representative of the three-person group, in Beiping and heard that the Beiping Executive Department had strictly ordered the Communist troops to withdraw to the area northwest of Chiju within 24 hours and wait for investigation and resolution, otherwise they should bear the responsibility for civil war. On March 1, the Communist troops' siege began to ease when the executive group arrived in Pingquan, and they gradually retreated, ostensibly ceasing fire, but plotting to attack. The executive group is currently ordering the Communist troops who have entered Jianping in violation of regulations in Pingquan to withdraw quickly, but there is still no concrete resolution.</p>
<p>[Reuters Chongqing Eighth Dispatch] Yishi Daily published today that the Communist army in the Northeast, along with other troops, launched a large-scale offensive against the National Army. The National Army is firmly resisting, awaiting orders from the Central Government.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Xuzhou Eighth Dispatch] The Xuzhou group of the Military Mediation Department quickly discussed the issue of Wanli traffic and other issues and reached an agreement. It is reported that the government has issued an order to its subordinate troops to earnestly comply. The contents of the agreement are as follows: (1) Commanders of each unit shall not obstruct railway workers repairing or carrying out repairs to destroyed roads, bridges and roadbeds, and shall be responsible for assisting the aforementioned workers in carrying out railway repair work. (2) The public shall be allowed to move freely or pass freely within military areas for the purpose of trade and agricultural production. (3) People in or passing through the above-mentioned areas shall not carry weapons. Those suspected of carrying weapons may be inspected. If weapons are found to be carried, they shall not be allowed to move freely within the area. [Also by telegraph] The principles of relieving the siege of Zaozhuang and restoring production have been determined, and technical issues are currently being discussed. The Transportation Group will go to Zaozhuang with the Xuzhou Group to discuss the organization of the Mining Area Production Committee together. It was unanimously agreed that there would be one representative from the government, one from the Communist army, one from the Transportation Group, and one technical representative from the mining area. The current dispute is over the area of the demilitarized zone.</p>
<p>[United Press Chongqing Eighth Dispatch] News from the CCP side here claims that the Linfen Executive Group in Jin Province has agreed that the government and the Communist armies in the four nearby areas will each retreat to their original positions as of January 13.</p>
<p>Ministry of Economic Affairs Sends Special Commissioner to Take Over Jiaozuo Coal Mine</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Kaifeng Eighth Dispatch] The matter of taking over the Jiaozuo coal mine was originally one of the issues discussed by the Xinxiang Executive Group. Marshal Marshall also attached great importance to his trip to Xinxiang. Xu Bin from the military conflict set off for Xin on the morning of the 8th to negotiate the takeover with representatives from the Communist side. If there are no unexpected problems, the task of this order from the Xinxiang Group may be achieved.</p>
<h3>Second Plenary Session Adds Report on Troop Consolidation and Ceasefire</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Chongqing Eighth Dispatch] It is learned that in addition to the established reports, the Second Plenary Session decided to add a report on the situation of troop consolidation and ceasefire, to be reported by Committee Member Zhang Zhizhong, and the CCP's true attitude towards military ceasefire, to be reported by Committee Member Zhang Qun.</p>
<h3>Plenary Session Continues Review: Report on Political Consultative Conference</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Chongqing Eighth Dispatch] The ninth meeting of the Second Plenary Session was held at 9:20 AM on the eighth. The attending Central Committee members were Yu Youren, Sun Ke, He Yingqin, Chen Cheng, Song Ziwen, Dai Chuanxian, Wu Tiecheng, Chen Guofu, Cheng Qian, Wang Shijie, and 333 others. Committee Member Ju Zheng chaired the meeting. After the Secretariat read the minutes of the eighth meeting, the chairman announced the continuation of the review of the Political Consultative Conference. The committee members who spoke included Cheng Tianfang, Lü Xiaodao, Zhang Jiuru, Zheng Yitong, Liu Wendao, Sun Jingya, Xue Dubi, Fang Zhi, Deng Feihuang, and Tang Zong. The session recessed at 11:00 AM. Summarizing the opinions of the various committee members, they still agreed with the principles of consultative unification, peaceful nation-building. However, regarding the spirit of the Five-Power Constitution, the exercise of the five types of rights, the organization of the National Assembly, and the various aspects of the citizen's oath, they advocated that no changes should be made lightly. Xue Dubi even stated that the Communist army was obstructing river management, making it impossible to measure and construct. He called on the party's representatives to the Political Consultative Conference to quickly negotiate with the Communist side, because the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) must end in March of next year, and our country must start construction as early as possible during the existence of UNRRA in order to utilize relief materials. The meeting continued at 11:25 AM. Premier Song Ziwen gave a political report that lasted half an hour, and then the Secretariat read the list of members of the Political Consultative Conference Review Committee. The conveners were Gu Zhenggang, Zhang Zhiben, and Lin Bin. The meeting adjourned at 11:50 AM.</p>
<h3>Soviet Troops in Shenyang Begin to Move North: Concealed Communist Troops Have Entered the City to Operate</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Changchun Seventh Dispatch] Shenyang Telephone: Soviet troops in Shenyang began to move north on the 7th. The Soviet authorities in Changchun negotiated with us, intending to borrow the barracks that we had previously repaired, but were unsuccessful.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Changchun Seventh Dispatch] Shenyang Telephone: Under the circumstances of the Soviet troops in Shenyang beginning to move north today, the situation on the periphery is as follows: (1) The Soviet troops in Huanggu District have withdrawn, leaving only two officers. (2) We have been notified to take over the Yunhe Railway Bridge, ten kilometers south of the city. (3) The Soviet troops on the Shenyang-Fushun line have also withdrawn. (4) There are also Soviet military vehicles from Dalian transporting to Shenyang. Generally speaking, it seems possible that the Soviet troops may suddenly leave Shenyang or southern Manchuria. Under these circumstances, the concealed Communist troops seem to be becoming active. Armed men in plain clothes have been discovered in the city of Shenyang, and the police authorities are planning countermeasures. Also, at 3:00 PM today, a major fire broke out at the Fuji Electric Company, which was formerly operated by the Japanese in the western district. The site was a Soviet warehouse. The fire was raging, and our police went to rescue, but were blocked by the Soviet troops. It is said that there was a lot of material stored inside.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Changchun Seventh Dispatch] A plane flew in today, and some personnel from the Ministry of Economic Affairs flew to Beiping. The plane that flew in four days ago had a malfunction and has not yet been repaired.</p>

(3) To establish a federal Vietnamese army, with Vietnamese people serving as officers. (4) To organize local autonomous governments; and (5) To establish autonomous police forces.

<h3>Marshall Returns to the U.S. from Geneva; Wedemeyer Arrives in Shanghai from Chongqing and Will Go to Beiping Tomorrow; Soviet Chargé d'Affaires Visits the U.S. Secretary of State to Deliver a Reply to the U.S. Note</h3>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 8th] It was learned tonight: General Marshall, who has just returned from inspecting the areas of military conflict in China, is preparing to leave China for the United States on March 12. According to reliable sources, Lieutenant General Wedemeyer, Commander of U.S. Forces in the China Theater, also plans to return to the U.S. within this month. Some observers have recently speculated that Wedemeyer might take over Marshall's work of supervising the reorganization and reduction of the Chinese army. However, well-informed sources believe that General Marshall will return to China to continue his mission until the Chinese army is reorganized. Neither Marshall nor Wedemeyer has made any statement regarding the possible duration of their stay in China. It is expected that General Wedemeyer will meet with Marshall, Lieutenant General Gillem, and Brigadier General Caraway, Commander of U.S. Forces in Chongqing, this weekend.</p>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 8th] It is rumored that General Marshall is currently discussing a visit to various parts of the Northeast in coordination with the U.S. State Department's decision to break the deadlock on the "Northeast issue." If this rumor is true, Marshall will face the most difficult task of his mission to China, and perhaps the most challenging of his life.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] General Wedemeyer, Commander-in-Chief of U.S. Forces in China, returned to Shanghai from Chongqing yesterday. He is scheduled to meet with reporters at 11:00 a.m. today on the eighth floor of the Construction Building. He will go to Beiping tomorrow or next Monday.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 7th] Secretary of State Byrnes instructed the chargé d'affaires at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow to present a note to the Soviet government regarding the activities of the Red Army in the Nine Eastern Provinces of China. The State Department did not release this note at the same time as the note on the Iranian issue. It is said that this is because it is not yet known whether the Soviet government has received the note, and therefore it has been postponed. Soviet Chargé d'Affaires in Washington, Novikov, visited Byrnes this afternoon. Neither side has made any statement about what was discussed, but Novikov was seen carrying a briefcase containing official documents, which may have been a reply from the Soviet Union regarding the Iranian and Northeast China events. Novikov told reporters that he could not disclose the nature of the meeting and was very sorry. When a reporter asked him to comment on the current world situation, he replied, "Some reporters seem to like to hear bad news and hate to hear good news." A State Department official said that the recent U.S. overt expressions on world affairs are not only directed at the Soviet Union, but also a new approach for the U.S. to deal with international events, hoping to force a quick and peaceful showdown. Past secret diplomacy only caused suspicion and did not help the overall situation. MacArthur Headquarters announced</p>

<h3>Truman Announces: The Anglo-American Joint Chiefs of Staff Will Continue to Perform Their Duties Until the End of the State of Emergency</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] San Francisco, 8th Broadcast: President Truman announced today that the Anglo-American Joint Chiefs of Staff will continue to perform their duties until the end of the declared state of war emergency.

<h3>Churchill Reiterates the Call for Close Cooperation Between Britain and the United States; The Compassionate Must Also Have Armor and Swords to Ensure the Safety of the Pilgrimage Road</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Richmond, Virginia, 7th] Churchill delivered a speech to the Virginia State Legislature today, urging close cooperation between Britain and the United States again, not to disadvantage anyone, nor to seize any interests, but to defend the most valuable principles of our people, not only for our own benefit, but also for future generations, to obtain honor and happiness. Before making this appeal, Churchill asked the audience: Do you know that it is quite dangerous for me to express my opinion? What I am saying, others know it is true in their hearts, but they dare not speak of it publicly. After making these remarks, Churchill said: In the past few years, I have deeply felt that there is a sentence I want to tell you, that is, we must be united. We should move forward courageously on the path to peace. This is our destiny, and it is also the will of God. As for how to achieve this goal, I still cannot tell you. Regarding whether Britain will therefore become a part of the United States, or the United States will re-enter the British Empire, I feel that the path of wisdom lies between these two extremes. We should find a way to cooperate, not only in times of war or difficulty, but also in times of peace. Wars must be prevented in peacetime. If the virtues of victory are not obtained, peace cannot be maintained. Peace cannot be maintained by empty words or diplomacy alone. Peace cannot be maintained by abandoning strength in times of danger. We must have sincere thoughts, a broad vision, and a loyal will. The compassionate must also have armor and swords to ensure the safety of the pilgrimage road. The English-speaking people must work together to fight for common principles. This is my construction and my hope.</p>

During the defense, his lawyer, Stahmer, first requested the court to summon two more witnesses: one was a German Air Force major currently detained in Nuremberg, who was dismissed by Goering for mistreating Allied Air Force personnel, and the other could prove that the assassination of Poles in the Katyn Forest in Russia in 1943 was done by the Soviet Union, not by Germany. In this regard, the court urged him to submit a written request. Stahmer continued, "The defendant's charge of repeatedly destroying the Treaty of Versailles is unreasonable.

<h3>Editorial: Establishing the Framework of a Democratic Political System</h3>
<p>Since the successful conclusion of the Political Consultative Conference (PCC), many people have expressed concern about the agreements reached by the "PCC," especially those concerning the modification of the political system. China, after a long war of resistance against Japan, urgently needs to recuperate and should no longer experience the calamity of war. This is the unanimous demand of the people of the country. The Chinese Nationalist Party (Kuomintang), which led the entire nation in the war of resistance and achieved victory, also has the long-cherished desire to return power to the people and implement constitutional governance. At the same time, other parties and factions are preparing to participate in actual politics under the recognized leadership of President Chiang Kai-shek as the national leader and with adherence to the Three Principles of the People as the supreme guiding principle for nation-building. To coordinate the opinions of all parties, the Political Consultative Conference was convened. The people of the country placed high expectations on the convening of this historically significant conference, and the results of this conference, on the whole, are indeed quite satisfactory. However, the agreements reached regarding the political system, especially the thorough revision of the "May 5th Draft Constitution," have essentially abandoned the essence of the Five-Power Constitution. The imitation of a bicameral representative system, the establishment of something similar to a responsible cabinet system, and the renewed adoption of so-called party politics—all of these, if they become reality in the future, will not only violate the spirit of the Three Principles of the People and undermine the framework of the Five-Power Constitution, rendering the efforts of the Kuomintang over the past fifty years futile, but will also cause Chinese politics to revert to a situation even worse and more chaotic than it was in the early years of the Republic. We should respect the agreements reached by the "PCC"—that is beyond doubt. However, if some agreements lead China's future politics towards chaos, it is necessary to give careful consideration before accepting them and putting them into practice.</p>
<p>This newspaper has commented on the convening of the Second Plenary Session of the Kuomintang Central Committee, stating: "Since the Three Principles of the People are the supreme guiding principle for nation-building in our country and have been accepted by all parties and factions, there should be no question as to how to implement the Three Principles of the People and the Five-Power Constitution. However, some of the agreements reached at this PCC meeting violate the spirit of the Three Principles of the People and the Five-Power Constitution, such as those concerning the five-yuan system and the status of provinces. The Five-Power Constitution is a great legacy left to the Chinese people by the Founding Father of the Republic and is a rigorous and precise system designed to remedy the defects of Western parliamentary politics and establish a sound political system for the Three Principles of the People, which should not be misunderstood or distorted. The agreements made at this PCC meeting regarding the draft constitution dismember and undermine the political system that the Three Principles of the People seek to establish. If implemented, they will render the efforts of the Kuomintang over the past fifty years futile... It is hoped that the Central Committee members of the Kuomintang, gathering in Chongqing, will be able to preserve the spirit of the Three Principles of the People while accepting the results of the PCC." Yesterday's Chongqing telegraph stated that the Second Plenary Session of the Kuomintang Central Committee held a heated review of the PCC, with the consensus that since all parties and factions adhere to the Three Principles of the People and recognize President Chiang Kai-shek's leadership in nation-building, there should be no distortion of the Three Principles of the People. It was also stated that "the Five-Power Constitution is the teaching of the Founding Father of the Republic and should not be changed rashly; the 'principles for revising the draft constitution' must be corrected." "In view of the shortcomings of the separation of powers system and the abuses of multi-party cabinet systems, our country should adopt a five-yuan system and a presidential system in the future." If the above can be formulated into resolutions and implemented in the future, it will truly meet the earnest expectations of this newspaper and the Chinese people.</p>
<p>Originally, the Three Principles of the People and the Five-Power Constitution cannot be separated. In a certain sense, the Five-Power Constitution is the core of the Three Principles of the People. The full implementation of the Three Principles of the People must have a political system based on the Three Principles of the People, and this system is the theory of the Five-Power Constitution that the Founding Father of the Republic left to us, expressed in the Five-Power Constitution formulated based on the teachings of the Founding Father of the Republic. Communism has its political system, which is the so-called Soviet political system. The British cabinet system and the American federal presidential system are both products of British and American history. We do not need to import them all wholesale, just as we do not need to import the Soviet political system. Now that all parties and factions adhere to the Three Principles of the People as the supreme guiding principle for nation-building, they should not abandon the framework of the Five-Power Constitution. Abandoning the Five-Power Constitution is abandoning the Three Principles of the People. The "May 5th Draft Constitution" promulgated by the National Government was originally a draft constitution formulated by the Legislative Yuan based on the teachings of the Founding Father of the Republic. Although it has undergone repeated discussions by people inside and outside the Yuan, it seems that there are still unavoidable shortcomings in the areas where considerations were insufficient. However, the system proposed within it is strictly and meticulously structured and forms a legal system in itself. We are preparing to implement constitutional governance, and since everyone adheres to the Three Principles of the People, the future drafting of the great constitution should use this draft as a blueprint for necessary revisions and should not fundamentally reject it and re-draft it. The five-yuan system is where the spirit of the Five-Power Constitution resides and should not be easily despised.</p>
<p>Here, we are reminded of a passage spoken by President Chiang Kai-shek at the memorial week of the Second Plenary Session: "This plenary session concerns the success or failure of our party and the survival of the country. All comrades must be calm and recognize the real environment at home and abroad, study practical methods, and not make indignant and empty arguments based on superficial and fragmented observations... The Political Consultative Conference... is a manifestation of the responsibility of our party to the country and the people. We should promote its implementation for the benefit of the country. However, the Three Principles of the People and the Five-Power Constitution are the consistent goals of our party's struggle, and the two cannot be separated. Some outsiders believe that as long as the Three Principles of the People are recognized, it is not necessary to adopt the five-yuan system. This point needs to be clarified in detail. The constitution is a major plan for the country's century. All comrades should review it based on the Premier's important teachings. However, since the conference has already made a decision, we can only carefully plan for remedies based on its broad outlines." From this, we can see how concerned President Chiang Kai-shek is about the agreements reached by the PCC in this regard and how he is preventing the Three Principles of the People from changing its nature. Indeed, preventing the Three Principles of the People from changing its nature is not only the business of the Kuomintang alone, but requires the joint efforts of the people of the country. The Kuomintang has a deep historical connection with the Chinese national liberation movement, and the Three Principles of the People is a great legacy left to the Chinese people by the Founding Father of the Republic. All nationals have a responsibility to defend the Three Principles of the People. Establishing the framework of the Five-Power Constitution is the demand of the Chinese people. We do not need to adopt imported political systems. We want to establish our own unique democratic political system.</p>

<h3>British Tram Company Resumes Partial Operation Yesterday; Department Store Labor Dispute Settlement Not Yet Effective; Clash at Wing On Company Results in Bloodshed</h3>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] A portion of the employees of the British Tram Company went on strike due to the arrest of three union directors, Zhang Xuekui and others. The strike reached its climax the day before yesterday. The Garrison Headquarters explained that these three individuals were arrested because they were reported to be suspected of collaborating with the enemy, and the informant provided sufficient evidence. Therefore, they were arrested and it has nothing to do with the trade union. They have now been sent to the court. If the prosecutor's office finds them innocent after investigation, they will be released. After this explanation, most workers understood the situation and went to work at the company yesterday morning. Some trams also left the factory to operate.</p>
<p>Troops Stationed to Protect Operation</p>
<p>However, a small portion of the employees insisted on continuing the strike and went to intercept the trams that had already left the factory, which caused several minor conflicts among the workers. Therefore, at around 7:30 AM, except for the Hongkou and Huishan districts, all British tram lines were suspended again. After receiving the news, the Municipal Police Bureau, Songhu Garrison Headquarters, and other military and police agencies immediately dispatched a large number of police officers to the head factory on Hart Road to investigate and persuade the workers to resume work. Most workers expressed their acceptance. At around 10:15 AM, two military policemen dispatched by the Garrison Headquarters were stationed on each tram that resumed operation for protection. Yesterday, more than 20 trams on lines 1, 2, and 3, as well as more than 20 trolleybuses on lines 24 and 16, resumed operation.</p>
<p>Employee Representatives Receive Press</p>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] Wing On, Sincere, Lane Crawford, China National Goods, Lihua, Zhonghua, The Sun, Lian An, Yushin, Dahu, and other department stores have jointly suspended operations due to labor-management disputes. To report the details and truth of the incident, the employees of the companies held a reception for reporters at 1:30 PM yesterday at No. 334 Nanjing Road, 3rd floor of the Industry Promotion Building. Han Wucheng, a representative of Sincere Company, stated that on February 23rd, the labor side requested improved treatment and proposed a requirement of 116,000 yuan. If the management handled it according to this, there would still be a profit of more than 70 million yuan per month. However, despite repeated mediation by the Social Affairs Bureau, it has not been implemented. And since the 7th, they have automatically stopped business. This action is enough to create social unrest, and Section Chief Zhang Zhenyuan of the Social Affairs Bureau also considered it inappropriate and ordered the companies to resume business. The management not only disobeyed its orders but also threatened that if the labor side did not make concessions, the business would be suspended for three months, and the food supply would be stopped. The employee side also stated that they would not yield even for six months. However, the labor representatives, deeply willing to consider the overall situation, decided to consider the Social Affairs Bureau's ruling that the base salary for staff is 60 yuan, the assistant staff is 50 yuan, and the trainees are 45 yuan. However, the management still has no intention of negotiation. However, according to what Section Chief Zhang said to the labor side, he can guarantee a solution within five days, and then continue to persuade the labor side to resume work and the management to resume business.</p>
<p>Conflict Between Both Parties Results in Bloodshed</p>
<p>While the labor-management dispute in the department store has not yet been resolved, a bloodshed incident has occurred in Wing On Company. The reason is that Chen Zuliang, Wang Zhenxin, and Zhu Baogen, the patrol team members dispatched by the employees, were stationed on the passageway leading to the manager's office in the new building of Wing On Company. At 12:15 PM yesterday, Guo Li'an, the general supervisor of the company, ordered them to leave unsuccessfully, so he invited more than 20 senior staff to negotiate with them, which caused a conflict. Chen Zuliang knocked out Guo's teeth, and Wang Zhenxin was injured in the eye. Fortunately, Bai Rong, the company's police, controlled the situation and telegraphed the military and police authorities, and the military police and police came together to maintain order. Because the negotiation with the employee representatives was unsuccessful, Guo Li'an, Chen Zuliang, Wang Zhenxin, Zhu Baogen, etc. were taken to the police station together. Upon hearing the news, the employees were indignant and raised two demands: (1) The company is required to publish an apology to the injured employees in the newspaper; (2) Compensation for medical expenses, and a guarantee that there will be no similar actions in the future.</p>
<h3>"Thank You, Mayor": The Wonderful "Three-Word" Review</h3>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] In order to comply with the request of the US military, the municipal government has exempted US military personnel from paying food retail donations from now on. US officers and soldiers do not need to pay other taxes in restaurants and dance halls except for food and beverage expenses. Before the municipal government clearly ordered the cancellation of the food tax payment for US military personnel, the US Army Newspaper repeatedly called on the municipal authorities to exempt taxes. Now that it has been fulfilled as desired, the newspaper expressed its gratitude, but the entire text uses only three words, namely: "Thank you, Mayor." The position of the publication is very prominent. The three words are not large, but there is blank space all around them, like news that has been censored. If it is not a regular reader of the newspaper, it may be inexplicable. This style has been common in the United States, but it can be called unique in this city.</p>
<h3>Tide Surge, Water Rushes, Ship Accident: Jiangtai Wheel Collides with Iron Barge; Crane Iron Rod Breaks and Falls Down; Five Sailors and Passengers Injured</h3>
<p>The China Merchants Bureau's Jiangtai Wheel sailed to Tianjin on the 14th of last month, and returned to Shanghai from Tianjin yesterday. At about 12:00 noon, it entered the Wusongkou, and at 2:25, it sailed to Zhongzhanpu surface. The US destroyer No. 522 in front slowly drove forward, and when it reached the front of the former Dongyang Company Wharf (that is, outside the Baidu Bridge), the ship turned around and anchored. At this time, it happened to be high tide, and the current was very fast. According to those familiar with navigation, the ship should turn to the left when turning around at high tide, but the ship suddenly turned to the right. The Jiangtai wheel followed it in the rear, advancing without guarding it turning to the right. In order to avoid friction with the ship, the Jiangtai slightly shifted its bow to the right, but the driver's sight was blocked by the ship's hull.</p>
<p>The first buoy on the river, there happened to be a crane iron barge of the Customs Shanhai Engineering Office J.M.G., tied to the buoy for repairs, which will be completed today. The Jiangtai waited for the ship to pass, and the iron barge was close at hand, although</p>
<p>Hard Reverse</p>
<p>But the tide was too fast, it was impossible to avoid, and the bow of the wheel ship rushed into the crane two-pole in the middle, and its power was great, no need to say. The two iron poles are big, about twenty feet high, and broke at once, and fell to the deck of the Jiangtai wheel. The deck was where the anchor machine was, and the crane jib,</p>
<p>All Were Crushed</p>
<p>The right side of the bow, the side iron plate was damaged by about two feet. At that time, two workers working on the bow and three passengers standing on the deck were all crushed. One of the sailors and one of the passengers were seriously injured and unconscious. The ship owner, Liu Xunda, immediately</p>
<p>Horn Sounded For Help</p>
<p>The Customs Port Affairs Department, upon receiving the news, sent the water police to rush there by small wheel. On the one hand, he urgently telegraphed the fire brigade to send an ambulance to the dock to rescue. The injured five people were sent to Shanghai Sanatorium, and the two above were seriously injured and have not been out of danger. The machinery on the iron barge to repair the equipment,</p>
<p>Most of It Was Damaged</p>
<p>But no one was injured. The wheel was originally scheduled to stop at Yangjiadu Wharf after import, but after the accident, the bow of the ship was stuck in the crane, unable to be disassembled for a while, so it stopped near the (former Dongyang Company) Wharf. The boom is made of steel, very heavy, and must be sawed off before the ship can be separated, and the loss of both parties is pending investigation.</p>

<h3>One Family Turned Traitor, Abusing Power and Doing Evil, Puppet Detectives Poisoned Relatives</h3>
<p>Wife Detained, Son Beaten to Death</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] Wang Zhiyuan, the current company commander of the 6th Company of the Motor Vehicle Corps of the Third Theater, is from Dongyang County, Zhejiang Province. At the beginning of the Anti-Japanese War, he followed the army to fight in various places. In April 1942, when Dongyang County fell into enemy hands, Wang's distant relative, Wu Xunhao, willingly became a traitor and served as a detective for the puppet Zhejiang Provincial Political Security Bureau. His father, Wu Zhaoqi, held an important position in the bureau, his brother, Wu Cheng, served as a warden, and his brother-in-law, Zhang Xiaoda, served as a team leader. The whole family turned traitor and colluded with each other, relying on the enemy's power and committing all kinds of evil. They led enemy police to detain Wang's wife, Lin Ailian, and Wang's uncle, Wang Nenghai. Wang Nenghai was severely tortured and became disabled. Wang's young child was pushed to the ground by Wu Xunhao and died as a result of illness. Because Wang's Whampoa Military Academy graduation certificate and letter of appointment were found in the house, they demolished the more than twenty rooms on the pretext. After spending a large sum of money, Lin Ailian and Wang Nenghai were released on bail. After the victory, Wang Zhiyuan came to Shanghai with the army and learned that Wu and others were hiding at No. 4 Juqingli, Xinzha Road. He reported to the Xincheng Police Sub-bureau, which ordered detectives to arrest them. However, Wu Zhaoqi and Wu Xunhao, father and son, had fled, and only Wu Cheng and Zhang Xiaoda were arrested and transferred to the High Procuratorate for investigation on suspicion of treason. The case was formally prosecuted. Yesterday morning, Judge Cao Jun of the Criminal Division of the High Court opened a hearing to investigate the case. The two defendants denied having served in puppet positions. Wang Zhiyuan was unable to attend due to official duties, and his company adjutant Yang Bozhou represented him in court, stating that the victims had now come to Shanghai and could attend the next hearing to testify. The court ordered the two criminals to be detained pending further hearing.</p>
<h3>Truth About Barge Accident: Caused by Kerosene Mixed with Gasoline</h3>
<p>The (HOLK203) boat rented by the Huasheng Shipping Bureau at No. 847 North Sichuan Road was undergoing repairs at the Ma Le Company shipyard in Yangshupu. Before completion, at 6 AM, when the cook on the boat was cooking, because there was kerosene on the deck, he was cleaning the machinery. At that time, the wind was strong, and the fire spread, burning four crew members, Huang Buwang, Gao Yuxian, Jin Baoxing, and Yuan Chonghan, on the spot. Fortunately, they were rescued in time, and there were no other losses. The cause of the fire was due to the oil purchased by the oil company, which disregarded commercial ethics and mixed it with gasoline.</p>

<h3>Difficult to Settle US Dollar Exchange, Importers Search for Cash</h3>
<p>The US dollar exchange rate fluctuates with the gold market. Recently, importers of various substandard foreign goods must settle in cash in order to fulfill their contracts and make up for their positions, resulting in continuous buying. Although the Bank of China's exchange rate is flat, it is difficult to obtain permission for this settlement, and they can only search for cash. The US dollar is easily stabilizing due to this support. Since the morning opening low of 2,070 yuan, the market has gradually pulled up, reaching a high of 2,200 yuan before noon, and then falling back slightly. As a result, the closing price was not much different from the previous day. The US exchange rate did not change. It is rumored that metal, yarn, and cotton are being settled.

The China Textile Construction Company seemed to be full of absorption due to the huge purchases in recent days. Only 400 bales of middling and Brazilian cotton were purchased. In addition, the price was difficult to negotiate with private cotton mills, resulting in no transactions. The market price was roughly the same as before.</p>
<h3>Rice Market Is Chaotic, Authorities Should Pay Attention</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, the rice price was once chaotic. Shopkeepers rushed to buy and sell, and the market was in turmoil. Later, the person in charge of the association persuaded the industry to stabilize the market, so the market became slightly more moderate. As a result, the price rose by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan compared to yesterday. Flour sales were also smooth, continuing to rise by 600 to 700 yuan.

<p>[Our Newspaper News] Yesterday, the rice price rose again, and white rice again knocked on the 30,000 mark. This reporter visited a person in charge of the Food and Political Affairs Office. According to the person, there are four key issues in the rice price rebound: (1) The gold market price has increased by 20% in the past two days; (2) General commodity prices have all increased; (3) After the recent decline in rice prices, there have been quite a few people who have been buying; (4) The weather has been raining and getting colder, hindering the supply. However, it is reported that Yang Xibiao, a special commissioner of the Food and Political Affairs Office, is expected to return to Shanghai today or tomorrow. The issue of rice purchase loans will be put into practice. At that time, a people's food commission may be established in this city to coordinate the handling of rice purchase loans. In addition, the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration will soon ship 20,000 tons of rice to Shanghai for distribution.</p>
<h3>Silk Continues to Rise</h3>

<h3>Dark Blue Serge Is in High Demand</h3>
<p>Stocks Are Not Abundant, Market Prices Are Quite High</p>
<p>Recently, the demand for dark blue serge is higher than usual in this street. Due to insufficient inventory and the factory's inability to continue production, the market is extremely popular. The prices of thick and thin grades are all firm, with medium-thick grades being less active than thin grades. Due to the spring weather, rayon and silk are less popular than all-wool serge, due to the manufacturing of garment makers and the preference of all walks of life for all-wool.</p>
<h3>Tea Market Transactions Subsided</h3>
<p>The Trade Association Has Elected Directors</p>
<p>Recently, tea transactions have been as rare as morning stars, probably because buyers are frequently constrained by tight money, lacking the motivation to buy. However, those holding goods are reluctant to easily sell due to the significant costs of their respective goods, resulting in a stable market with prices fluctuating. There has been no significant change compared to before.</p>
<p>[Our Report] On the 7th of this month, at 2:00 PM, the Shanghai Tea Trade Association held a general meeting of members at the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce near Tianhou Temple Bridge. Besides the members present, the following results were achieved: Shi Yuan was elected as Chairman of the Board; Wu Hongsheng, Zhu Zhenhuan, Li Naichang, Zhang Jialin, Hong Jingwu, and Song Qifan were elected as Directors.</p>
<h3>Bank of China Official Explains: Reasons for Higher Forward Exchange Rates</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Various sectors have speculated about the forward exchange rates offered by the Central Bank, leading to various misunderstandings. This newspaper's reporter specifically raised several questions to an official from the bank. The official's answers are presented below: (1) The bank's opening of the foreign exchange and gold market this time is based on observing market conditions, with the premise of stabilizing foreign exchange and gold prices. This measure is purely based on the latest theories worldwide and has been adopted by various countries. It is indeed effective in stabilizing currency and gold prices. (2) The bank's offering of forward exchange rates this time is purely to facilitate trade for importers and exporters. For importers, if they order a batch of goods from the United States and expect delivery on April 8th, to avoid the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on their actual import trade profits and losses, they can pay a specified small amount to a designated bank to pre-purchase a certain amount of US dollars due on April 8th, in preparation for timely payment. The bank selling this forward exchange is required to repurchase an equivalent amount of spot exchange as a reserve for the importer to settle the exchange before April 8th. Therefore, the bank selling the forward exchange effectively invests a certain amount of funds in the forward exchange. In the above example, the investment period is one month, so one month's interest should be calculated as compensation for the importer's use of the bank's funds. Based on the bank's current forward exchange rates, the calculated interest is less than 0.5% monthly, while the hidden interest reaches more than 2% monthly. (3) If the bank or other designated banks have foreign exchange settlements, it means that imported goods have been ordered and are awaiting shipment. Judging from the recent frequent increase in foreign exchange settlements, ordered materials will soon be shipped in continuously, which will help stabilize domestic prices to some extent. (4) The bank's announced US dollar exchange rate has not changed, providing the greatest confidence in stabilizing the exchange market. According to an economist's observation, the bank's offering of the April forward exchange rate at 2120 yuan does not mean that the April US dollar exchange rate will be fixed at 2120 yuan. In addition to the interest charged by the bank for one hundred days, it implicitly indicates that the April US dollar exchange rate will not be higher than the current telegraphic transfer rate. Given the small difference between forward and spot exchange rates and the low interest charged, there is a possibility that the April exchange rate may be even lower.</p>
<p>Education and Sports</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Promotes Electrified Education; Plans to Establish Five Work Teams This Year</h3>
<p>[Our Chongqing Report] The Ministry of Education has always attached great importance to electrified education. It has established the China Educational Film Studio, which has produced 48 educational films. At the same time, it is in contact with British and American film news agencies to implement electrified education using films. This year, it plans to establish five electrified education work teams. In the first half of the year, it will first establish two teams: one will remain in the capital to implement electrified education in nearby areas, and the other will be used for teaching in remote areas. Recently, Chairman Chiang also issued a handwritten order to formulate a preliminary five-year electrified education implementation plan and a public education film plan, which the Ministry of Education is currently drafting. It is heard that when electrified education is widely implemented, the Ministry of Education will have its own educational broadcasting station. Whether it is during commemorative weeks, class time, or entertainment time, broadcasts can be made, allowing people to listen to celebrity speeches at any time. Broadcasting will be used as a substitute for public education, and when public education films are implemented, all cinemas will be improved uniformly. Although the jurisdiction of local cinemas will still be in the hands of the Social Affairs Bureau, the guidance rights will belong to the educational administrative organs. In this way, supervisors can also inspect cinemas, checking whether the films they show are in line with public education and whether they violate or are unsuitable for public health, and they can provide guidance and corrections. Electrified education will be promoted in many ways. (An)</p>
<p>Educational Films Transported from Chongqing to Nanjing</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Report] In order to promote electrified education, the Ministry of Education has sent Du Weitao, Section Chief of the Third Section of the Social Affairs Department in Chongqing, which is in charge of electrified education, and Yang Rubiong, Director, to Nanjing on the 4th, carrying 22 educational films produced by the Educational Film Studio to work at the ministry.

<p>Movies Shown in American Schools</p>
<p>[New York Telegram Second World] The rapid training of armed forces during the Great War has led to various new teaching methods, the most effective of which is sound films. Therefore, educational films used to teach the armed forces are now being used in schools. Currently, schools in all forty-eight states in the United States are widely using sound films as a teaching tool. Before showing films in the classroom, teachers first describe what the students will see, and then the students ask questions. In this way, films not only help understanding but also guide creative planning and supplementary reading materials, but teachers still hold an important position.</p>

<h3>Leake Startled in Liaocheng; Claims It Was Like Exploring a Wilderness</h3>
<p>Liaocheng, western Shandong, has been besieged by the Communist army for a long time. The military and civilians inside the city lack coal and food, and the situation is serious. Colonel Leake and his party from the Jinan Executive Headquarters traveled by car from Jinan to the area on the 24th to mediate. They returned to Jinan at 5:00 PM on the 27th after a four-day round trip.</p>
<p>Colonel Leake of the Jinan Executive Headquarters, government representative Tu Xuwu, Communist representative Zheng Rennong, along with Ruan Jianhua, Chief of Staff of the government's 20th Group Army, Huang Yuan, Director of the Foreign Affairs Office of the Communist Shandong Military Region, and translator Wang Xi, departed from Jinan in a jeep. Colonel Leake acted as the driver. Although the road was extremely bumpy, he drove directly north due to his skilled driving techniques. In the afternoon, they passed Qihe and traveled northwest for about 60 li to Zhuzhuang, which was already within the Communist army's territory. As the car approached Zhuzhuang, a gunshot suddenly rang out, and bullets flew in the air. A large group of Communist soldiers emerged from the village, surrounding the car. The situation became serious and felt like facing a formidable enemy. Colonel Leake, surprised by the unexpected turn of events, got out of the car and shouted repeatedly, "I am U.S. Military Attaché Colonel Leake." The Communist side, Huang and others, got out of the car and explained vigorously to the surrounding Communist soldiers. They learned that the village was stationed with a regiment of the Communist army's Zhu Jingwu unit, which had mistaken them for the enemy, causing this incident. After half an hour, the car was allowed to pass. Colonel Leake laughed and said, "The road on this trip is so uneven, and the encounters are so unexpected, it's truly no less than exploring a wilderness!" At 5:00 PM, they arrived at Wotang County, where the Communist County Chief Jie Jinsheng led the military and civilians in welcoming them. Leake and his party went to the county government to rest and met with representatives of the people, most of whom carried petitions accusing traitors.</p>
<p>At 9:00 AM on the 26th, Leake met with representatives of the people of Liaocheng. Standing on the car, he addressed the crowd, saying: Whether it is the Chinese Kuomintang or the Communist Party, the government has decided that the Communist army will be reorganized into 20 divisions, and the National army will be 90 divisions, all of which will be national troops. Previously enemies will become good friends later. He hopes that China will no longer divide its own strength and will gather all its strength to build a new, modern nation. The United States is willing to provide China with weapons prepared for the war against Japan (enough to equip) one hundred and eleven divisions, so that every soldier has an automatic rifle and a 105mm howitzer. I have been in the Northeast for a long time and know very well that the Soviet Union should have withdrawn its troops from China's Northeast according to the agreement, because China's peace is the foundation for world peace. Therefore, I have sacrificed my personal material enjoyment in the United States to work for China's peace, etc. In the evening, it was windy and snowy. It only cleared up on the 27th. They left the city at 9:30 AM, braving the cold to return, arriving at 5:00 PM in the afternoon.</p>

<h3>A Cloud of Dust Leaves Tongguan</h3>
<p>— Fan Hong</p>
<p>This Newspaper's Henan Airmail Dispatch, February 20th</p>
<p>It's difficult to reach Chongqing, difficult to live in Chongqing, and even more difficult to leave Chongqing. Fortunately, I, the reporter, received assistance from various parties. After spending more than four months in Chongqing and waiting an indefinite amount of time, I was fortunate enough to get a plane seat to Xi'an, which can only be considered great luck. On the eve of the flight, Mr. Qi Liangyu of the Battlefield Service Corps kindly provided accommodation, sparing me the various difficulties of waiting for the plane at Baishi Station, which made me feel infinitely comforted and warm inside, and also increased my anticipation for the interview trip to North China.</p>
<p>Xi'an Itinerary</p>
<p>On the morning of the 12th, the plane began to take off. The weather that day was perfect, with clear skies and the sun shining obliquely, ideal for low-altitude flight. The heating pipes inside the plane were turned on, making it feel like spring. People showed joyful expressions, quietly waiting for the plane to move forward, accompanied by the sound of the engine. The journey was smooth and fast, reaching Xi'an Airport in two hours, a rare occurrence in previous flights.</p>
<p>After getting off the plane, people felt a great burden lifted. They took a comfortable breath of fresh air, facing the piercing northwest wind and welcoming the warm sunshine in the sky.</p>
<p>Sitting in a car into the city, the dust kicked up by the wheels filled the streets behind the car, mercilessly falling on everyone's heads and bodies. We began to enter Xi'an. Xi'an is an ancient capital, and although barren on the Northwest Plateau, it is still grand enough. The tall and wide city walls, the broad streets, the ancient old trees, and the honest and simple folk customs all give you a completely different new impression. To put it bluntly, Xi'an is a bit too backward compared to other major cities in the country.</p>
<p>Here, women wear cheongsams that cover their feet, and men don't wear suits and leather shoes. Lipstick and high heels are almost extinct. Barber shops and movie theaters are extremely "careless." Shoe stores and department stores have incomplete goods and are not flashy. There are no dance halls at all. If a woman with a perm and high heels appears, it will attract the attention of many people, and some backward women will even chase them to see them up close.</p>
<p>There aren't many big restaurants in Xi'an, and even fewer serving Jiangzhe, Cantonese, Hunan, Beijing, or Shanghai cuisine. There are also many brothels, which is said to be due to the lack of hotels and the large number of travelers. In fact, there are not few hotels, with statistics showing over a hundred, and the large number of travelers is indeed a fact, but the abundance of idle money and the lack of entertainment are also major reasons for the increase in prostitutes.</p>
<p>There are several newspapers in Xi'an, including the Xijing Daily, Zheng Bao, Qingnian Daily, Northwest Cultural Daily, Yishi Bao, Qinfeng Industrial and Commercial Joint Edition, Xijing Ping Bao, North China News, and Xinqin Evening News. Zheng Bao has the widest circulation. Apart from the "Plateau Monthly," there are no other magazines to be seen. The cultural circles in Xi'an are extremely depressed, cultural work has no development, news personnel have no security, and news work is really difficult to develop.</p>
<p>The general price level is lower than that of Chongqing, by about one-fifth to one-third, but the quality and quantity are too poor. So, rather than saying that prices are cheap in Xi'an, it's better to say that the standard of living is low. Xi'an retains the style of an ancient capital, but it is not a luxurious and extravagant city. One cannot hear decadent music. What one hears instead is suppressed, unfree cries of suffering and injustice.</p>
<p>Perhaps Xi'an is too large, lacking people, houses, and institutions, and political achievements are not yet very significant. However, the authorities have a determination to work hard and have far-sighted vision and plans for everything. In the future, Xi'an, and even Shaanxi, may become progressive regions.</p>
<p>The reporter stayed in Xi'an for a week and continued on his journey after the Lantern Festival.</p>
<p>Reconnaissance of the Longhai Railway</p>
<p>After a week in Xi'an, I boarded a Longhai Railway train heading east. The Longhai Railway is the only railway remaining in the country during the war. It has shouldered the great responsibility of the War of Resistance and continued the hardship of recovery, contributing greatly to China. Currently, the western end of the Longhai Line can reach Tianshui, and the eastern end can reach Shanzhou (tickets are only sold to Tongguan). The section from Shanzhou to Luoyang is being rushed to repair and is expected to be completed by the end of May. Luoyang to Zhengzhou can be reached directly. There are two routes from Zhengzhou to Kaifeng: one is to take a light train, follow the old Yellow River railway bridge to Xinxiang, and transfer east; the other is to pass through Zhongmou over the Yellow River and take a train east. The former takes two days, and the latter takes one day. East of Kaifeng is connected to Xuzhou. East of Xuzhou, after being destroyed by the Communist army on the 14th of last month, the road to Lianyungang has been cut off to this day. This is something that the people going to North China deeply resent.</p>
<p>There are three trains from Xi'an to Tongguan every day. The third-class fare to Tongguan is 690 yuan, second-class is doubled, and first-class is doubled again. Few passengers get off along the way; those going to Tongguan account for 90% of the total. Some passengers can't buy tickets and have to buy them on board. People have endured eight years of hard life during the War of Resistance, and they are no longer allowed to choose when taking the train. It's enough to put their bodies on and not walk, and it's enough to put their luggage on and not carry it. What's the point of talking about sitting, lying down, or being comfortable? Everything on the train is already inferior to the past, and with the overcrowding of passengers, there is no enjoyment at all, only the discomfort of polluted air, restricted movement, and no place to sit or lie down. For passengers heading east, Xi'an and Baoji both have joint transportation offices to handle joint transportation registration, with twenty people at each office, which can save the trouble of waiting for the train in Tongguan. Those who register, in addition to having military or public personnel certificates, those with personal connections are faster. However, abuses and unfairness are gone, and it is much more advanced and fair than airplane registration.</p>
<p>The reporter arrived in Tongguan at 11:30 AM and stayed at the military station until dawn before leaving the station, which is also a convenience for passengers.</p>
<p>Tongguan in Perspective</p>
<p>Tongguan faces the river and backs the mountain, bearing the brunt of the Fenglingdu Pass, which is a natural barrier known to all Chinese people. During the war, it resisted the enemy's invasion, but Tongguan was the one that took the most artillery shells. The city is full of ruined walls and broken buildings, with no human habitation, only weeds and horses, fully showing the deep pain of the wounds it suffered during the war. It almost sacrificed its entire life for the country.</p>
<p>The area near the station in Tongguan West Pass is a newly emerging street. In the past, when trains traveled between Shaanxi and Henan, it was once prosperous. When the railway opened, Luoyang and Xi'an took its place. Now, it has once again become a necessary stop for travelers between Shaanxi and Henan, so everything is set up for travelers.</p>
<p>What you can't imagine is that the streets are very new, and eight or nine out of ten hotels have just been built. The rooms are small and short, and the prices are 400, 500, or 800 yuan per room. Each quilt costs 150 yuan, which is quite expensive. Food is also more expensive than in Xi'an, with a plate of food costing no less than 300 yuan. Poor people mostly live on porridge and steamed buns. The small street, less than half a mile long, has many patterns and is comparable to a city.</p>
<p>Behind the vegetable market, there are also many entertainments, like Chongqing's Jiaochangkou. There are street performers, medicine sellers, fortune tellers, opera singers, and storytellers, a variety of things to amuse idlers. Beyond that area is the river beach, where you can go to the Yellow River to admire the rushing waves and the turbulent flow of the Yellow River day and night, and look at Fenglingdu Pass, which has been occupied by the enemy for many years. The beautiful rivers and mountains urgently need to be restored, which fills people with indignation. The joint transportation office stands behind the train station. The allocation of train seats is 50% for military personnel, 30% for public and educational personnel, and 20% for civilians. The fare to Luoyang is 6,530 yuan and only long-distance tickets to Luoyang are sold (a total of 261 kilometers, calculated at 25 yuan per kilometer). Seven trains depart daily, two for the Longhai Railway and two for the joint transportation office, all of which are trucks, with only a few simple sheds and no seats.</p>
<p>About 6,000 passengers arrive in Tongguan every day, with three trains. Except for 10% who cross the river to Shanxi via Fenglingdu, at least 5,000 people want to go east. Large horse-drawn carts, drawn by three or four horses, are called "Jialala" cars. Each cart carries more than 2,000 catties and runs about thirty a day. It takes five or six days to reach Luoyang, but it can carry more luggage and avoid the anxious long wait in Tongguan with its high cost of living. Rubber-wheeled carts pulled by people are called "Jiazi" carts, mostly for short trips, with uncertain prices. Many people also walk. About twenty or thirty boats cross the river north from Tongguan every day, mostly taking small roads to Taiyuan. The fastest takes eight days to reach Taiyuan.</p>
<p>There are sales points for the Shen Bao and other newspapers in Tongguan, as well as resident reporters from various Xi'an newspapers. The county-level work is extremely dull. The working hours are from 9:00 AM to 4:00 PM every day, and it's all routine official business. New policies and construction sites are also nowhere to be seen. The Shanxi-Chahar-Suiyuan Branch of the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration is also in the city and is preparing to start work (February 20th).</p>
<p>American Military to Conduct Atomic Bomb Tests</p>
<h3>Atomic Bombing of Warships: Three Experiments to Be Conducted</h3>
<p>In May and July 1946, the American military will conduct two experiments of atomic bomb bombing warships on Bikini Atoll in the Marshall Islands in the Central Pacific. These two experiments will determine the future of naval combat power. A single atomic bomb will destroy one hundred naval targets. Among them, thirty-five are Japanese, German, and other foreign ships, ranging from submarines to aircraft carriers and battleships. Up to 20,000 people will participate in the experiments.</p>
<p>The United States Joint Chiefs of Staff has selected Vice Admiral Blandy as the commander of the First Joint Special Task Force. In the first experiment, a B-29 Superfortress will take off from Kwajalein Atoll and drop an atomic bomb a few hundred feet from the target. Eniwetok and other coral islands within a radius of 200 miles will be evacuated first. The second atomic bomb is scheduled to be dropped on July 1st, targeting several warships. The third deep-water experiment may be held in 1947.</p>
<p>(Top) The USS Pennsylvania, the flagship of the United States, will also be one of the bombing targets.</p>
<p>(Middle) The USS New York will be one of the atomic bomb test targets to be held in May and July of this year. Other targets include the USS Arkansas, the USS Nevada, the aircraft carriers USS Saratoga and USS Independence, sixteen destroyers, eight submarines, the German heavy cruiser Prinz Eugen, the Japanese battleship Nagato, and the light cruiser Sakawa.</p>
<p>(Bottom) Another bombing target is the Japanese battleship Nagato (American translation).</p>
<h3>Old Friends Reunite at Sea: Air Force Captain Mao Shangzhen Intensifies Training for Shanghai Air Mobilization</h3>
<p>Shanghai Jiangwan Airport is the main base for the Sino-American Air Force in Shanghai. Airplanes take off and land every day, as frequently as eagles take off and land near cliffs in the wilderness. Marshall, Patterson, and Wedemeyer have all landed and taken off here. Jiangwan Airport always has a constant flow of people and vehicles, becoming a focal point of attention for the people of Shanghai.</p>
<p>In the military camp area within a two-kilometer radius, the Shanghai-based unit of the 1st Squadron, 1st Group of the Chinese Air Force, has Captain Mao Shangzhen of the 2nd Flight as its leader, sitting at his desk, solving the constant stream of problems from morning to night.</p>
<p>Twenty-Two Missions</p>
<p>Captain Mao Shangzhen is tall and thin, with big eyes, and doesn't look at people much, even when he smiles, his eyelids droop. After graduating from aviation school, he immediately fought in the unit, piloting Soviet Ilyushin Il-4 and B-25 aircraft. Based in Liangshan, Sichuan, his 2nd Flight bombed Japanese military targets along the Pinghan Railway line between Wuhan, Zhengzhou and Xinxiang throughout the year. He personally led the aircraft on twenty-two missions. The most difficult one was the bombing of the Yellow River Railway Bridge in Zhengzhou on April 12th last year. The enemy had deployed dense anti-aircraft artillery positions on the railway bridge. Two holes were blown in the bridge, and the bridge piers collapsed, but all their aircraft were riddled with bullets like a hornet's nest. One B-25 never returned.</p>
<p>Elite Bomber Squadron</p>
<p>The 1st Squadron of the Air Force was originally an elite bomber unit in the Chinese Air Force. The current Squadron Leader, Major Wu Kunchen, is a veteran who has taken off to bomb enemy positions more than thirty times in a year. In army combat, officers at the regimental level rarely have the opportunity to fight directly, mostly serving in the front-line fortifications or taking command during the advance. But the Air Force is different. The higher the position, the more they have to brave bullets and danger, flying in the lead to lead the entire unit forward to fight. Xu Huansheng, the commander of the 1st Wing, is a famous combat leader who personally braves bullets and various dangers.</p>
<p>Air Crew Trainees</p>
<p>Currently, the 1st Squadron is converting some combatants to fly air transport aircraft. The first American air transport aircraft to come to China were C-47s, with a transport capacity of 4,500 pounds per aircraft. During the early stages of China's blockade, C-47 aircraft transported essential military supplies to China. Later, the demand for air transport increased, and C-47s became outdated (but they are still the best aircraft for passenger transport, seating thirty passengers, larger than the fourteen-seat transport aircraft before the war). A type of air transport aircraft called C-46 became more common. These aircraft can carry 8,500 pounds of supplies and are also twin-engine. The Shanghai-based unit of the 1st Squadron in Jiangwan is responsible for the C-46 air transport aircraft training, under the direction of Captain Mao Shangzhen.</p>
<p>Training Implementation Method</p>
<p>These aircrew trainees in Shanghai are all veterans of the 1st Squadron. The first five groups are trained by the American Air Force, starting with aircraft instruction, then aircraft performance flights (experiencing and understanding the performance of the aircraft in flight), followed by normal takeoffs and landings, single-engine takeoffs and landings (in case one of the two engines fails, you can still take off or land with one engine), instrument flying, and crosswind takeoffs and landings (in case you can't find a designated airport, you can also take off and land at a small airport), and finally loaded takeoffs and landings, culminating in a long-distance loaded flight. The entire training time is twenty hours, and a bomber pilot is transformed into an air transport aircraft pilot.</p>
<p>The Air Transport Security Team goes to the Northeast, sends investigation teams to inspect the front lines and railways, and delivers supplies to small villages where transportation is disrupted. All of this can be done very thoroughly.</p>
<p>Happy Reunion with Old Friends</p>
<p>Captain Mao Shangzhen has completed the training of several groups in Shanghai in three months. Fighting seems to have faded away like a dream, a shadow of smoke. Back in Liangshan in those mountains, when I followed the B-23 to bomb the Pinghan Railway bridge, Captain Mao taught me how to use parachutes and dangerous response techniques. All of that is in the past. Now, in Shanghai, where cars flow like water and horses like dragons, in Shanghai, where food, clothing, housing, and transportation are completely modernized, we old friends reunite, drink a cup of coffee brewed on an electric stove, watch the red glow of firewood burning in the stove, and it feels like another world.</p>
<p>Single Old Youth</p>
<p>From combat to air transport, the heavy burden on the Air Force has not changed from the war era to the peace era. Mao Shangzhen has been out of aviation school for eight years, enduring the hardships of war for eight years. He has turned himself into a thirty-two-year-old single old youth. Time has passed, and he only has a few colorful pieces of copper and iron in his small luggage. Those are a Huaguang Medal (designated for the Battle of the Yellow River Bridge), a first-class and second-class Propaganda Medal each, and a third-class Air Force Restoration Medal. According to what he told the reporter, he likes to eat good cigarettes, loves to drink coffee, loves to keep warm by the fire in winter, and loves to gather and chat with a group of young men with the same fate. He gets up at 6:00 AM every morning, and after his chatting comrades disperse at 9:00 PM, he handles team affairs alone until he goes to bed at 12:00 AM. I heard that the captain is getting married soon. He pointed to a photo and said, "I like her very much!" (Zhu Minwei.)</p>

<h3>On "So Be It"</h3>
<p>— Xiaoshan</p>
<p>In old Chinese dramas, there is a very common and very important 'line,' which is 'So be it.'</p>
<p>The problem is not the original meaning of the two words 'So be it,' but the 'transcendent nature' of 'So be it.' After the actor says 'So be it,' the plot often changes suddenly, with new developments and new performances.</p>
<p>For example, when Saierdun gets back his double copper coins, he still wants to settle old scores with Huang Daquan. After Zhu Guangzu explains it frankly, he suddenly has a great epiphany, and with a decisive and clear 'So... be it!' he blurts out 'Let's write off the feud between our families!' They shake hands and make peace, and Leping regains its glory.</p>
<p>For example, when Mo sees that his master is about to die, he can't help but burst into tears, and with a desperate 'So... be it!' he decides to die to repay his master! The plot then takes a major turn.</p>
<p>The production of 'So be it' is very laborious. At this point in the drama, the actor is seen staring, clenching his fists, raising his voice, 'So' is blurted out, long and forceful, with the tail dragged into a 'flying tone,' then closing his lips, stamping his foot, nodding his head, and forcing out a short and heavy 'be it,' while the 'scene' strikes a beat, and the big gong 'clangs,' making the air so tense that you can't breathe. The actor's 'doing' reaches this point, the audience's emotions gather at this point, and the climax of the plot also ends here.</p>
<p>Therefore, 'So be it' is a turning point, a representation, and a 'determination' in the actor's mouth. When the mountains and rivers are exhausted and you suspect there is no road, once 'So be it' is said, it turns into 'a new village appears with bright flowers and dark willows!'</p>
<p>Many audience members with knowledge of drama know how to predict the arrival of 'So be it.' This play, this situation, this time, this place, 'So be it' should be said, they observe very clearly.</p>
<p>What's terrible is: everyone is stretching their necks, waiting for the stage to come up with a 'So be it,' a new expression, a new determination, a new style, a new facility, but the actor is still slowly dancing his 'water sleeves,' singing 'Return of the Dragon,' in the same old tune, how can the audience not be disappointed?</p>
<p>Therefore, the graceful 'So be it' is also distorted and understood differently: 'Forget it!'</p>
<p>The audience shouts a full house: 'Better not sing!'</p>

<h3>Life in the Universe is Insignificant</h3>
<p>— Gangren</p>
<p>Look, celestial bodies are in motion, rivers are flowing, everything tells us how harmonious the great universe is, how lively the world is, and all this harmony, greatness, and vitality are expressed in the living world. It makes us experience the vastness of space, the eternity of time, cherish the universe of the past, and look forward to the future world.</p>
<p>'Atomic energy' gives us supreme power, and 'radar' will connect us with the moon, further increasing the moving nature of the living world and unfolding the infinite hope of mankind.</p>
<p>Life can be said to be the master of all things, it is so important, then how many living worlds are there in this universe? From ancient legends and myths, it can be known that people in the past thought there were many places where life existed, but these are just legends and myths.</p>
<p>Modern astronomical physics tells us that space is so large, there are so many stars, but the living world is pitifully small.</p>
<p>The surface temperature of the celestial bodies we see is between 1,600 and 30,000 degrees. At such high temperatures, molecules cannot exist. In this extremely turbulent atomic circle, no one believes that life exists! What's more, the temperature outside the enclosed mass is 460 degrees below zero Fahrenheit. It is simply impossible for life to exist. But astronomers tell us that this is how it is everywhere in the universe except for the solar system; the physical conditions required for life—a suitable temperature such as a liquid environment—are only one in ten thousand trillion in the universe.</p>
<p>In the solar system, the surface of the sun reaches 6,000 degrees, and the existence of life is almost impossible. Among the nine planets surrounding it, except for the Earth, which has life, Neptune and Pluto are too far from the sun and have become frozen hard blocks; Mercury is too close to the sun and has become a boiling mass, and there is no hope of life. The temperatures on Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus are all between 150 and 170 degrees below zero. There is a lack of internal heat, and relying solely on sunlight is not enough to sustain life; also, there is no water such as oceans, and the ground is covered with ice and snow, so life cannot exist.</p>
<p>Although the temperature on Venus is closer to the temperature on Earth, the daytime is extremely hot, and the nighttime suddenly drops to 75 degrees below zero. Even if there is life, it would be difficult to adapt!</p>
<p>As for Mars, it was once thought to be similar to Earth, with a rotation period similar to Earth's (only a few minutes difference), and the temperature at the poles is between 90 and 120 degrees below zero, and the red passageway temperature is about 40 degrees. It was observed that there were intersecting canals and climate changes, and it was most likely to have life. However, it is disappointing when viewed through a 100-inch telescope. What were previously thought to be climate changes and intersecting canals can be said to be formed by wild changes in deserts and the like. Therefore, at least conscious life lacks evidence of existence, but if it is necessary to speculate that there is life elsewhere, Mars is more likely.</p>
<p>The precious flower of life blooms in this Earth suitable for life with a very accidental opportunity, and conscious human beings measure and study this universe, striving to uncover the mysteries of all physics and the universe, which is very meaningful.</p>
<p>Since life is so rare in the universe, how can humans not seek mutual benefit and move forward hand in hand?</p>

<p>Various Thoughts</p>
<h3>Are Chinese People Really Incapable?</h3>
<p>— He Enguang</p>
<p>The phrase "Chinese people are really incapable" has recently become strangely popular in society. Readers have probably heard it. To put it bluntly, perhaps you've even said it yourself? Today, let's try to objectively evaluate the appropriateness and meaning of this phrase. In my personal analysis, the psychology of those who say this largely stems from witnessing many unfair facts, corrupt morals, or inappropriate government measures in society, leaving them feeling helpless and sighing in resignation. However, it also inevitably contains two kinds of psychology: one is that Chinese people are really incapable, but everyone else, like me, must be able to do well, and I am the most hopeful person in China; the other is to express that China has been disappointed and cannot be improved no matter what, and even my personal efforts are in vain. In short, no matter what meaning it contains, it is always a negative statement and will never have positive significance. Strangely, although it is so popular, I have never heard the chairman say it, or other worthy people in society say it. I think that even if Chinese people are not good now, it should never be said: "Chinese people are really incapable." Because if they are not good, do you want them to remain bad forever? Don't you want to find a way to make them better? Furthermore, we keep saying that Chinese people are really incapable. Are we also Chinese? Have we done well ourselves? True, perhaps Chinese people are not capable, but why are Chinese people not capable? Have we done any research on this? Therefore, instead of saying that Chinese people are really incapable, it is better to say: "Why are Chinese people incapable?" That would be more appropriate. Otherwise, if everyone always shouts "Chinese people are really incapable" in a negative way, China may really not improve. However, at the very least, we all hope that China will improve.</p>

<h3>Good Early Spring Morning Light</h3>
<p>— Su Yin</p>
<p>The brilliance of the morning sun shines on the morning sky, and in the silent air, one or two crowings of chickens and the subtle chirping of birds can be heard. Ah, what a clear and tranquil early spring morning this is! Although the air is still quite chilly, this is a unique characteristic of early spring – clear and solemn. In such a beautiful morning light, we are taking our children outdoors to welcome the arrival of early spring, letting the clear morning breeze wash away the turbidity of the night, and letting our languid souls be revitalized by the vigor of the morning.</p>
<p>However, many lazybones who are not blessed to enjoy this are still lying in bed, ignoring their young children's calls to get up. The windows are tightly closed, and the curtains are heavily drawn, for fear that the fresh air and radiant sunlight might seep in. They breathe in the foul air of the bedding and curtains, confined in the small room that still retains the image of the previous night, forming a clear boundary with the outside world: outside is the morning light of early spring, bright and full of vitality; inside is the gloom of the night, gray and lifeless! The people inside do not realize that this is the beginning of another day, and dreams still entangle their hearts; they are still figures from the previous night.</p>
<p>Poor lazybones, you are too foolish! Do you think "lying in bed until sunrise" is happiness? But the bright sun is sighing. He bestows his precious sunlight and the vitality of spring upon you, hoping that you will receive his kindness, like all other insects, flowers, and trees on the earth, making you full of vitality and vigor. But you are so foolish, writhing in bed like a hibernating lazy snake.</p>
<p>Only the farmers are the happiest. They get up in the hazy dawn to welcome the arrival of light, they bathe in the morning light, breathe in the fresh air, cultivate and harvest, bringing golden grain to the world. Work, sunshine, and air make them healthy and happy.</p>

<h3>Social Services　Answers to Readers</h3>
<p>Zhang Zuxiang from Anhua County asks: (1) Is "air injection" the latest treatment method? What is the method of injection? Is it injected regularly or daily? Do ordinary hospitals have this treatment equipment? (2) My current condition is that my chest sometimes feels slightly painful and there is an unnatural sensation. My throat constantly secretes a mucus-like substance with a salty taste. I don't cough, and my appetite is good. In addition to "air injection," are there any other medicines that are easy to mail? Dr. Zhang Zhongming answers: (1) Air injection is a type of atrophy treatment for lung disease. The method of implementation is to inject air into the pleural space to compress the affected part of the lung, stopping the erosive effect early. It is injected once a week or every few days and continues for one to two years to see results. However, whether this method can be used must be determined by X-ray or fluoroscopy. (2) The main treatments for lung disease still involve rest, air, sunlight, and nutrition. There are no special drugs for sale on the market. Chen Shunshun from Baiguan, Zhejiang Province, asks: My wife is in her twenties and has been suffering from stomach pain since March of last year. Many Chinese medicine doctors have seen her and said they can't do anything. Now her lower abdomen is very large, and there is a hard lump starting from the middle of her abdomen, which is extremely painful. At this moment, her lower back is also swollen, and sometimes her chest is very painful and she cannot breathe. Her appetite is still good, her hands, feet, and face are not swollen, she has not had her period for eight months, her urination is short, and she cannot sleep peacefully at night. Please ask a famous doctor to indicate an effective pill formula for her to purchase and take.</p>
<p>Dr. Zhang Zhongming answers: I don't know if your wife is pregnant. Otherwise, it may be an ovarian cyst that needs to be surgically removed. It is best to have a gynecological examination by a doctor to clarify the situation.</p>
