<h3>國軍進抵長春近郊　共軍昨晚起向吉林退卻　白副總長離瀋飛平轉京</h3>
<p>〔本報北平廿二日電〕熊式輝·杜聿明聯名希望中共自動退出長春，安東之通電，迄今猶未見中央社播出，一般推測或係恐刺激中共及影響南京談判情緒所致。此電係廿日　自瀋拍出者，熊杜在通電所提出之解決東北問題意見，為「只要共產黨軍隊遵守停止軍事衝突與軍隊整編方案等協定，自動退出安東及長春等地及我政府前已接收之各地，並退出鎭口沿綫，儘先恢復交通，而由三人小組或執行部負責調處」。</p>
<p>〔中央社瀋陽廿二日電〕廿二日夜十二時范家屯急電報告，國軍已迫近長春近郊。據先頭部隊報告，長春全城暗無燈火，電源顯已斷絕。廿二日黃昏時，共軍即已開始向吉林方面退卻。</p>
<p>〔中央社瀋陽廿二日電〕白副長日前偕杜長官梁副總長兵官司等赴四平街視察，今早返瀋，白氏復於今午偕李廳長佼龍離瀋飛平轉京。</p>
<p>〔合眾社北平廿二日電〕今日據此間權威方面消息，向長春推進之國軍五縱隊之一，已抄越公主嶺正面與共軍作戰。</p>
<p>〔合眾社南京廿二日電〕軍令部宣稱：國軍已於昨日收復長春與四平街間之公主嶺，並收復四平街東三十七哩之西安與該城七哩之朝陽坡（譯音）。國軍部隊刻集結於公主嶺東廿六哩之伊通，正向公主嶺後第二站鎭柳桑子（譯音）推進，距離最後目標長春五十哩。</p>
<p>〔聯合社瀋陽廿二日〕電據此間昨夜接到前綫軍事消息，國軍正分五路向長春推進，新一軍中路已於昨晚七時進駐公主嶺，該地在長春南一百廿華里，國軍先頭部隊追擊退卻共軍，已開抵公主嶺北面廿一華里處。西路國軍已開到朱家店及遼陽，東路開到公主嶺東面九十華里處，東南路則已收復四平街東面一百廿華里之西安。</p>
<h3>共軍增兵平綏路　揚言將進攻南口</h3>
<p>〔本報北平廿二日電〕官方消息，共軍正向平古路平綏路中間地區之懷柔昌平一帶增兵，昨又開到懷柔縣屬之麻　嶺橫嶺五個團，軍調部內中共負責人並曾公開表示，共軍根據某種理由，有進攻平綏路南口之準備，懷柔縣城西方十里之橋梓村，新開到共軍一個團，作攻擊準備。</p>
<p>〔本報北平廿二日電〕北平附近衝突已日漸擴大，今日西鄉來人談，西山一帶有零星衝突，惟執行部原擬派遣調處北平附近衝突之卅三小組，刻因熱河調處糾紛之牽連，今日尙未出發，且亦無出發確期，該小組乃由負責視察北平外圍之執行部人員，擴充而成，政府代為李競俊中校，中共代表為宋紹德中校，美方代表為馬利上校，原定視察路綫為先赴安次，龐各莊調處，再轉懷來視察，現不知何時日始能成行。現故都南北軍事衝突，正激烈進行，安次之後，聞俘菜軍二千餘，官方宣稱國軍力量，足可鞏固平津保安全。</p>
<h3>軍事三人組正準備復會</h3>
<p>〔本報北平廿二日電〕軍調部昨接南京長途電話謂，軍事三人小組正準備復會。</p>
<h3>加強調處工作　協定尙未簽字</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿二日電〕據悉：馬歇爾特使鑒于執行調處工作之頻遭困難，認為執行小組之職權必須加強，並應提高威信，最近曾與經北平飛來之政府代表鄭介民，美方代表饒伯遜及三人會議國共雙方代表商得補充辦法五項，已見前報，該項協議，原撥以和字第七號命令發表，但因三人委員中共方代表臨時不願簽字故暫行擱置。眾信廿一日馬帥與周恩來氏之二小時長談，即與此事有關。</p>
<p>銅圖說明：中丹商約簽字情形王外長（左）丹麥專史考夫曼（右）</p>
<h3>市內治安周密無虞　濟國軍靜待調處　周至柔昨飛抵濟南視察</h3>
<p>〔本報濟南廿二日電〕共軍蓄意撕毀停戰命令，近從各地調集大軍，企圖四路進犯濟南，國軍為恪遵停協定，始終忍讓，靜待執行小組進行調處，俾化干戈為玉帛，惟當局對於濟市治安，措施周密，確保無虞。</p>
<p>〔本報濟南廿二日電〕航委會周主任至柔，今日飛抵濟南視察。</p>
<p>〔本報濟南廿二日電〕濟陽共軍千餘人，廿一日進攻距濟南東北四十里黃河以北之石家務，當於清晨四時與國軍發生遭遇戰，迄晚戰事仍在激烈進行中。</p>
<p>〔本報濟南廿二日電〕軍息，番號不明之共軍約三萬人，近由東北取道海運在煙台登陸，刻已越過平度，向濰縣進迫中。</p>
<p>〔本報濟南廿二日電〕據悉，魯境共軍已下令各縣鄉鎭，實行青苗總登記，一俟麥熟秋收後，即將實施計口授糧制，每口日給新糧一斤半，餘均沒收，以供軍用。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿二日電〕據政府某要員告本報記者，濟南之被共軍包圍，已逾半年，近頃山東共軍受延安密令，發動廣泛之攻勢，並自士週起縮小濟南東西南三面之包圍圈，向省垣進攻，其用意顯在聲援長春垂危之共軍，以期拯救其必敗命運。猶憶上週中共負責人發表恫嚇性之宣傳時，曾謂如政府堅持必須收復長春之主張，一旦春長共軍失敗，中共即將在他處發動攻勢，以賠償東北共軍之損失，足見共軍擴大內戰之軍事陰謀，蓄意已久。目前圍攻濟南之一幕，亦為其聲東擊西之慣技，觀於最近膠濟·津浦·平綏·北寗·同蒲各路及皖北，蘇北各地共軍挑　之行動，可見共軍之目的，不僅在濟南一地而已。政府現深體歇爾特使斡旋全面和平之苦心，並尊重馬使日前為呼籲雙方停止宣傳戰發表之聲明，對共軍之暴行，不欲多所論列，但對目前共軍不惜　喪國家元氣，犧牲人民生命財產，將內戰擴大至關內各地之軍事陰謀，恐已無法再事容忍，局勢業面臨重要關頭，惟望中共懸崖勒馬，迅速停止圍攻濟南之妄圖，以謝國人。</p>
<h3>熱河情勢漸穩定　調處工作目前尙難展開</h3>
<p>〔本報北平廿二日電〕官息，熱河方面國軍已有援車開到，情勢漸見穩定，但軍調部之調處工作仍難開展。官方聲稱：執行部派往承德，赤峯等地之小組，在共軍發動攻勢前，已失去工作及行動之自由，為重新恢復其和平工作，執行部於十九日派朱戒吾上校（政府），李聚奎少將（中共）偕美方代表飛往承德，與共軍高級將領交涉，但彼等到達後，中共代表李聚奎及遲不與政府，美方代表見面，致此項交涉又告停頓，執行部則對此甚為焦慮。</p>
<p>〔中央社北平廿二日電〕錦縣訊：侵據北票之共軍，突於十八日晚開始撤退。</p>
<h3>共軍砲擊泰安　守軍未予還擊　遵停戰命令</h3>
<p>〔本報濟南廿二日電〕泰兗共軍，調動頻繁，駐軍迭遭射擊，屢有傷亡。共軍新四軍第一師第一旅廖政國部一二三團，約三千餘眾，由兗州附近北竄，其中二千餘名，已於十六名迫夫安車站，構築工事，企圖攻勢，共軍魯中軍區張振武率部七千餘人，於五月十五日開抵泰安東西三十里一帶，十六日晚復竄至萬德以南泰肥邊區一帶，十五日共軍並以迫擊砲向泰安西關守軍陣地射擊二發，彈落空地，我無傷亡。守軍恪遵命令，未予還擊。</p>
<h3>共軍猛攻東明　展開激烈戰鬥</h3>
<p>〔中央社開封廿二日電〕軍息，久被圍困之東明縣城，今日指曉遭共軍兩　之眾警撲，與守軍展開激烈戰鬥，情況異常緊急，截至下午六時止，戰鬥仍在進行中。</p>
<h3>瀋陽以北地區　並無美機飛行　吉倫謂蘇聯廣播可疑</h3>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦廿二日電〕莫斯科電台今日廣播塔斯社電訊稱：據「可靠消息」，美方飛機在東北轟炸人民革命軍時，被擊落七架，旋經證明駕駛員係美國人，人民革命軍不勝憤懣。</p>
<p>〔聯合社本埠訊〕駐華美軍司令吉倫將軍稱：莫斯科廣播，謂有美機在東北被擊落情事，此說「甚屬可疑」本人並未接有何種報告，並追述中共以前宣稱美國飛機在東九省活躍以後美軍所發表之命令，謂瀋陽以北並無美國飛機飛行。</p>
<h3>參政會駐委會　明日在京集議</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿二日電〕國民參政會駐會委員會，定廿四日上午九時舉行，計現在京之駐會委員有林虎，范予遂，尹述賢，許孝炎，薛明劍，何春帆，劉眞妍，達浦嘗，甘家馨，汪寶瑄。又現在滬可能趕到者有左舜生，張君勵，陳啓大，　揆一諸氏。</p>

<p>〔中央社重慶廿二日電〕記者頃訪王寵惠博士，叩詢國防最高委員會改組事，渠稱：議會原為戰時機構，即將改組為中央政治委員會而為本黨政治上最高決策機關。該會改組後，原負軍事及政治方面之職責，將交由國防部及國民政府委員會，分別經管，中央政治委員會之成立，將在國府全部改組就緒後，王氏頃在渝候船東下，渠與鄒魯氏可能於短期內內船赴京。</p>
<h3>蘇軍司令宣布　完全退出東北</h3>
<p>〔合眾社倫敦廿二日電〕莫斯科廣播塔斯社電訊稱：蘇軍駐東北總司令馬林諾夫斯基元帥總長宣布：蘇軍已於五月三日完全退出東北。</p>
<h3>邵力子對本報記者談　局勢有好轉可能　停止宣傳戰將見諸實行</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿二日電〕時局已至瞬息萬變之緊要關頭，制止關內戰事蔓延，國共雙方停止宣傳戰，即將見諸行動。今晚邵力子曾於百忙中，以異常之笑容接見本報記者，曾謂：先將長春問題解決，再談其他，雙方之意見，頗為接近，惡化之局勢，有急遽好轉之可能，願蒼天佑我中華，救我同胞。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿二日專電〕自馬歇爾呼籲停止宣傳戰之聲明發表後，政府與中共之雙方宣傳負責人彭學沛·陸定一，昨今曾頻有接觸，聞馬使於昨日接見周恩來·彭學沛時，復懇切說明目前雙方均須停止宣傳戰之必要。今日下午三時，周恩來·陸定一曾聯袂往訪彭學沛，而九時雷震及彭學沛二人復至瑯琊路八號，與邵力子作長談。據邵語本報記者，尊重馬歇爾先生意見，停止無謂之宣傳戰，使凄厲殘酷之兵爭，軍事，化為文明之舌爭，和平可立待。</p>
<p>〔合眾社南京廿二日電〕中央黨部秘書長及政協政府代表吳鐵城，今日往訪共黨代表董必武與李維漢。</p>

<h3>長春廿九天（五）</h3>
<p>— 本報特約記者邵愼之</p>
<p>重砲坦克攻中行</p>
<p>這裏是中央銀行的最後戰鬥情形，愼之親歷這場戰穴。</p>
<p>十七日下午，竹舟的　享把趙市長·貝克特·艾伯娜·世洵·卓之等五人送回寓所之後，居然還開車回到中央銀行。愼之正在等司機回來，只見他滿頭大汗，跑進地下室來說外面的情形，汽車無論如何不能再出去了。</p>
<p>自此以後，中行對外交交通完全斷絕，愼之喜歡鑽來鑽去，雖然子彈橫飛，但沒有一天不到中央銀行跑兩回，他有一種特別哲學，以為子彈如果找得到你時，什麼地方也找得到，這下子擱在中央銀行無法活動，竹舟對他說：你命定要住到中央銀行來的。他只好無話可說。</p>
<p>這天我們發出最後一個英文電報，我們到長春後每天發電報給中央新聞兩報，我們現在還不知道有沒有完全能夠收到。</p>
<p>這　　　投的彈藥，全是七九步彈，不合口徑，全不中用，守軍白喜歡了一陣，而情況由於國務院及滿炭的失守而趨緊急，共軍這兩天來照例是拂曉攻擊一次，傍晚攻擊一次。十六日中央銀行北三日公尺處的三中井洋行落一砲彈，大同廣場也落十幾發，這分明是對中央銀行發的，但是中行還沒有中到一顆，今晚可開始中砲彈了。</p>
<p>國務院遭砲擊起火，於是守軍只好退卻，守軍自十二日起接觸算起，到今天已有六天，保安隊從沒有奪回已經失去的據點，戰綫愈縮愈短。昨天放棄了新皇宮西北角和宮內府，今天中午放棄國務院，在共軍傍晚攻擊中，又放棄了博物館·電報局和白山公園·大同公園地區，北面守軍退到豐樂路，南面守軍退據協和會館（即前蘇軍司令部）市政府·警察廳一帶。</p>
<p>這時已有許多文職人員商討到突圍問題，他們向陳家珍提出，但陳不作這樣的打算。</p>
<p>十八日上午雖然槍聲很密，比較起來，並不是劇戰，大有感到沉寂，中央銀行的人越擠越多，負傷的都到這裏來求醫藥，幾天沒有吃到飯的，希望能夠在這裏獲得一點食物，然而這裏已沒有所謂後方，擠着上千的人，外面是砲火連天，這些問題都不易解決。</p>
<p>中午共軍的重砲調整了砲位，從東西兩面對中央銀行，市政府，東拓大樓一帶轟擊。到處起火，市政府的是火箭砲彈，而且分明是使用燒夷彈，這是總攻擊的開始。共軍坦克車也出動了，從火車站方向開過來，停在大興公司門口，南面開來的停在協和會館門口，誰也沒有知道的共軍有坦克，共軍使用坦克是不可想像的事，據報告說是打死了一個日本坦克手，我們這時無法看到屍首。</p>
<p>中央銀行雖然極為堅固，但是還是有些搖撼，共軍把藥包拖到建筑物旁邊，使它爆炸，重迫擊砲彈曾經有一顆掉到屋頂上。有些砲彈打破玻璃窗攢到裏面爆炸。</p>
<p>這時投送彈藥的飛機來了，在上面盤旋，共軍的砲火就暫時萎熄下去，不像昨天一樣拼命用機關槍打它了。可是當被辨明是運輸機後，砲彈又繼續發射，這天所投的彈藥多落入大同公園，全部給共軍抬去。</p>
<p>市府已經着彈起火，中央銀行後部也起火，戰事達最高潮，戰事就在大同廣場區，中央銀行打到最後，因為有發電機，還有電燈，還可以打水，雖然數次起火，所以很容易灌救，市政府和東拓的火卻越燒越大。</p>
<p>愼之還想爬到屋頂上去看看，可是無論如何也辦不到了，登在樓上的士兵，也統統擠到地下室，砲彈和槍彈就在屋子裏飛來飛去。</p>
<p>陳家珍這時開始討論如何突園。</p>

<h3>當前國事已至決定階段　政府方針迄未變更　盼共黨為國家留一綫生機</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿二日電〕本報記者連日與京中中外各方人士，頻頻接見，談話每涉及當前國家大局，所獲印象可綜合報道如下：當前國事，一般人所關切者，厥為政治與經濟兩大問題，此兩大問題實則為一單純之政治問題，蓋當前經濟難關之克服，非僅緊於經濟本身，諸如交通破壞，時局不安，均為生產阻滯，物價高漲之事實及心理因素。故政府自去秋勝利以來，即一再委屈求全，舉行政治協商，政府改組，國大代表增加名額等等，均在求得問題之和平解決。因唯如此，全國交通方能恢復，地方秩序，方能安定，走上經濟建設之大道，確收抗戰勝利之結果。所惜共黨始終未具誠意，尤以東北接收問題，更違反停戰命令，故前此對協商寄予多少熱望之第三者我盟邦人士，今日口頭上雖仍抱樂觀，但察其內心，對共黨之眞面目，實已獲有一新認識。然以上所述，非謂當前政治問題，已至不能和平解決之階段，若干人士並具體指出，政府一貫方針迄今固仍未變，問題癥結，端視共黨是否尙有國家觀念，並願為國家民族，留下一綫生機。惟此須有事實表現，目前各方之渴望於共黨者，一為東北方面之長春接收問題，勿蹈四平街之覆轍，和平談判之重開關鍵，即在於如此。二為勿將軍事行動擴大至關內各地，徒使局勢複雜，無補於事實，亦絕非解決問題之道。至各方對於政府，僉認當政者應對國家負責任，此種責任，不僅在於目前，且須顧及今後千百年之歷史批評，舉棋不定之作風，如長此延續，人民實在已不堪再拖。此種看法，記者遽來默察政府中若干人士，似亦已抱有同感，現大局已至一決定階段矣。</p>

<h3>資源會石油公司設滬　統一經營石油事業　三年內可望完成初步建設</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京廿二日電〕關於資源委員會成立中國石油有限公司事，頃該會負責人發表談話如次：石油對於國防及民生關係極為重大，故各國政府對石油事業，均十分注意。我國石油事業，方在萌芽，亟應加強組織，積極推動，我國礦業法正式規定，油礦應歸國營，資源委員會以職責所在，爰經於本月十八日設立中國石油有限公司，統一經營中國石油事業之產煉運銷事宜，資源委員會原有之石油機構，如甘肅油礦局，四川油礦探勘處及新近在收復區接收之台灣油礦，上海煉油廠，錦州及覺西煉油廠，與各地油粒儲運設備等，一槪併入該公司，預計三年內，可完成初步建設。甘肅方面，產煉並重，台灣方面，注意購買外國原油，加以精煉，同時對甘·青·川·台各省油田探勘工作，亦將加緊進行，上項工作，擬約請美國著名工程公司協助實施。該公司董事長由翁文灝擔任，且已派定孫越崎·吳兆洪·許本純·孫拯等為董事，公司地點與各方面接洽便利起見，設在上海。</p>
<h3>共黨破壞郵政眞相　交部有關當局對記者談</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿二日電〕月來各地共黨割裂郵政，破壞郵政及發行郵票之事，曾迭有所聞，記者昨特走訪交通部有關當局，詢問眞相，據談：抗戰勝利以前，共產黨雖曾封鎖郵路及干涉郵政，但正式割裂郵權，破壞郵政系統，則始於勝利之後。共黨破壞郵政系統，其方式有如下述六種：（一）擅自設立郵政機構，名稱則各地不一，如在河北北平及河南各郵區者稱「交通局」，在山東郵區者稱「戰郵局」，在蘇北者稱「淮北邊區交通局」，由「專員公署管轄」。此外在遵化及河間則設有郵政管理局，在蘇北各地又設「交通站」，名稱雖不一，而其經營郵政業務，公開寄遞郵件則一。（二）擅自發行郵票，共黨所發行郵票，據調查所得，至少有三種，一為在煙台發行之印有毛澤東照像郵票，二為在江蘇啓東海門一帶發行之「抗幣」郵票，三為在河北易縣發行之「蒙疆郵票」。（三）接收原有郵局，截至目前止，江蘇·河北·山東·河南及北平等郵區內，已被接收之郵政局所，雖尙無詳確之調查與統計，但相信至少已在二百以上，接收日期多在三十四年十二月以後。（四）拘捕郵政員工，已調查明白者，有如城·青縣·高陽·邯鄲·修武·煙台等地之局長以及員工共約三千餘人。（五）封鎖郵路。（六）強迫郵局全體員工限期退出。基於上述事實，則本月七日上海大公報所載陳光昭先生所作「論中共地區內郵政問題」一文中，謂因郵政自中共地區撤退，予人民及中共以口實，中共之「交通局」乃不得不擴大組織，取而代之，殊有背事實。例如煙台郵局之被接收，在三十四年八月廿六日，冀東各縣郵局之被接收，在本年一二月間，先此各該處郵局，固均未撤退也。且證之共黨更換郵政人員，封鎖郵政路綫，非法發行郵票，則不但未子人民以便利，反予人民以不便。至對此事之態度，簡要言之，可有兩點：（一）郵政機構，應維持其一貫的統一，絕對不容有破壞或分割情事。郵政之設立，旨在為人民服務，不應因政局之轉變，而有所更張，是以過去多次內戰，迄未聞對郵政有「接收」情事，即敵僞時代，亦能遵守國際郵政公約，維護郵政固有之系統。茲共黨擅自設立機構，發行郵票，不但破壞郵政系統，抑亦有背國際郵政公約與郵政法之精神，如謂「解放區」之郵政局所，未能普遍成立，共黨乃不得不出此策，則只須共黨能予以便利及保障，本部固願視其需要，普遍設立。（二）郵政人事制度，應保持其獨立的精神，不容因人擇事，加以破壞，郵政人員之任用，「高級人員由考試院考，中級人員由高試院授權各區管理局辦理」，絕無因人擇事與倖進等情事，此實行之幾十年為我國最健全之人事制度，乃共黨接收各地郵局後，紛紛委派人員，甚至以郵差提升局長，不但破壞健全之人事制度，且將造成倖進之風。</p>

<h3>另設聯合國救濟機構　聯總將宣告結束　中國方面延至明春三月</h3>
<p>〔中央華盛頓廿一日合眾社電〕聯總署長拉加第亞今日可盼向聯合國提出撤消該署之建議，該署官員稱：杜魯門糧食特使胡佛，曾建議設一新聯合國機構，包含聯總之職權在內，拉加第亞表示同意。原定於聯合國糧食農業委員會召開世界糧食會議前發表演說，渠或將於該演說中，宣布贊同將該署之職權，移交聯合國。拉加第亞已令其部屬，準備結束計劃，俾提出該署八月所召開之理事會，渠告其助手謂：該項工作，於移交予一永久組織後，仍為環球所切需者，該署於歐洲之合法存在時期，將以六月為止，於中國則可賡續至明年三月。</p>
<p>〔合眾社香港廿二日電〕喬治慕拉德在「港華郵報」上撰文謂：上海一地對聯總貨物之投機行為，「嚴重阻礙聯總之工作，並構成暗損中國政府領土完整之威脅。」並稱：「中國各埠投機家市儈，毫無約束之買賣行為，已迫使聯總停止其低價出售救濟物品之舉。明國當局正探求其種顧全面子之計劃，從中國官場手中取出其分配權。麵粉之公費，幾全為黑市商人之雇員與親友所得，而市儈們則染指於裝往長江各埠之聯總船貨。」慕拉德又稱：二月一日前，廿萬噸救濟物品中，運出上海者，僅三萬噸，但至三月廿二日時，廿四萬七千噸救濟品中所運出者，已增至十四萬六千噸，主要原因，乃將華宇運護送工作委託與美國海軍所致云。</p>

<h3>起來，不願做奴隸的人們！</h3>
<p>— 謝雲翼</p>
<p>「起來，不願做奴隸的人們！」這是中國民族作曲家故聶耳先生當中國民族的生死關頭，為中國民族的解放而喊出來的悲壯歌聲。故聶耳先生作這首歌的時候，正是「瀋陽事變」以後，日本步步加緊侵略中國的時候；「不願做奴隸的人們」，是不願做日本奴隸的人們啊！經過八年的苦鬥，中國民族在聶耳歌聲的感召下振奮了起來，卒顛覆了日本的軍閥及其侵略主義。在過去的八年中，聶耳的故鄉雲南，做了我們抗戰的重鎭，我們民族的生命綫。如今抗戰是勝利了，日本軍閥是擊潰了；聶耳太平洋下有知，曾富含笑。然而橫在中國民族前面的危難，卻較聶耳在日更為嚴重；我們將日本擊潰了，卻又臨到更嚴重的民族生死關頭。當時是有開的民族的生死關頭，現在似有形而無形，似無形而有形，正惟其如此，所以較當時的「最危險的時候」更為「危險」，更為嚴重；這民族的歌手泉下有知，想亦不期而會喊出「起來！不願做奴隸的人們！」的雄壯的呼聲。</p>
<p>現在是怎樣一個更危險的時候？對日作戰是勝利了，國府也已經凱旋還都；可是自東北，熱河，以至蘇北，戰爭又在進行中，國有鐵道幹線的交通迄未恢復，而國內各地的糧價乃至一般物價均一致地不斷騰漲，民生日趨艱　。這種局勢是怎樣造成的呢？任何客觀的觀察者都會異口同聲一致地指出是由於共黨的搗亂和破壞。政府為了顧到戰後民生的艱困，中國統一的必要，不惜委曲求全與中共及其它黨派及無黨派份子開誠協商，原　協商獲有成果，中國可以從此太平，交通可復，干戈可息，以致力於建國大業的展開。可是協商方慶成功，而陰　又集，戰爭又起，交通不但未復，毀路之風益熾，擺在眼前的事實，明明在指出，凡此種種，都由於中共的發動，中共應負全責，而若干無聊政客卻呼籲雙方息爭，此其所為，實等於聲援中共的破壞，為虎作倀，助紂為虐。若干國民，不加判斷，不滿於政府現實的施政，又從而遙為呼應，影響所及，實足以動搖國本。這種局勢若不加糾正，不特我們八年來艱苦的奮鬥將付東流，甚且將使我們民族倫為奴隸；到那個時候，必將悔恨已晚。這正是我們民族的生死存亡的又一緊要關頭，在這個時候，我們要重新提出「起來，不願做奴隸的人們！」的呼號！</p>
<p>的確，政府的現實施政有令我們不能滿意之處，但我們不能因政府施政的不能滿意，而移轉我們對政府的忠忱。糧價漲到將近七萬，人民生計日蹙，不錯，是由於政府的未能有妥善的措施，但我們對當前的經濟危難若加追究，便可以發見經濟危險之所以未能減輕，乃至解除，一部份固由於政府舉措的失當，而其主因卻由目前國內現實的政治環境。共黨破壞交通，使貨不能暢其流，在共黨控制區域內有「抗幣」的發行，使幣制益趨混亂，使政府對已經膨脹了的通貨整理更覺為難，使物價步步高升。政府為了顧到戰後民生疾苦，亟待善後復興，所以不惜委曲求全；希望舉國一致，解民倒懸。然而政府這一種苦心，卻遭到共黨的破壞，使政府不但不能積極展開種種興民更始的措施，轉使當前的經濟危難趨於嚴重。是則此項局面的形成，中國共產黨又該負其責任。</p>
<p>這是共產黨的一種政略，要使中國不安，要使中國的經濟危難深刻化，要使中國交通系統的擴大破壞，要使政府加重困難，然後它希望可以得到更多的羣眾來做它的奴役，來建立它所理想的社會主義的蘇維埃中國。理想的追尋，原是人情之常；不滿於現實施政，而自我陶醉於未現實的理想，是亦不足為例外。利用了這種政治心理資本，共黨呼號「民主」，呼號「社會主義的建設」，呼號「新華」。蘇維埃政制之下而有「民主」，那眞得侮辱了我們這位「德先生」，這無待我們的指陳。至於說「新華」，共黨統治下的「新中華民國」將不再是中國，將使我們整個中國變成「九一八」以後的「滿洲國」，做了別人的傀儡。中國將沒有民族工業，將加入其它一個正在進行中的「共榮圈」，「農業中國」「工業××」，將使我們的民族經濟沒有發展的一天，四萬五千萬的中國自由人，均將淪為奴隸。這是怎樣一種可怕的策略！不願做奴隸的人們！把我們的血肉，來保衛我們的中華！</p>
<p>本年四月號的「哈伯」雜誌「Harper's」刋出了一篇關於蘇聯的文章，其中說到如何蘇聯當日本投降之日，正式公布第四五年計劃的實行。依據這個計劃，在一九五〇年，蘇聯須年產純銅三千五百萬至四千萬噸，積極擴充海軍，在遠東建立強固海軍基地，添造商船等等。蘇聯之所以實施第四五年計劃，據公布文告是：「蘇聯必須具有供給歐亞兩洲蘇維埃勢力圈內各國以資本裝配的能力」。蘇聯的政論家認為蘇聯的安全將受到威脅，如果各隣邦不從蘇聯方面獲致資本商品；蘇聯與各隣邦如欲維繫緊密的政治合作必須建立在一個堅固的基礎上，就是政治的密切合作必須基於經濟的密切合作，而以經濟合作中，必須以蘇聯為中心，從波羅的海以至高麗，蘇聯必須為這廣大區域內資本商品的中心。這不是「共榮圈」是什麼？明乎此，所以我們在東北的工礦設備要被搬走。在「大東亞共榮圈」被擊潰了的今日，卻有國家企圖在建立起另一種新的「共榮圈」，而在我們的國內，卻有呼號「民族解放」的一些「前　份子」，企圖將我們牽入另一種「共榮圈」去。我們預備做奴隸嗎？起來，不願做奴隸的人們！</p>

<p>短評</p>
<h3>美國的和平攻勢</h3>
<p>美國國務卿貝爾納斯自巴黎返國之後，即在前天，向美國人民發表廣播演說，報告此次四國外長會議失敗的經過，並強調美國政府所採取的和平攻勢，聲明美國決為歐亞兩洲曁世界其他各處政治的經濟的和平而努力，務須達到此目的。其所提出的具體計劃，質言之，如下次四國外長會議對於召開廿一國和平會議仍不能商得協議，則美國將以此事訴諸聯合國大會，不問蘇聯贊成與否，和平會議必須於最短期間召開。</p>
<p>我們對於貝爾納斯國務卿的奔走號呼，致力於世界和平的奠定，素所欽佩；對於他們提出的新計劃，更表贊同。但仍有加以補充說明的必要。</p>
<p>戰後的世界各國，尤其是美國莫不盼望戰後的世界能步入民主和平的新時代，由國際間的合作，奠定世界和平的百年大計；無如國際上矛盾，旣無法解除；而各國的『安全感』又各有不同，因此這個希望就難有實現的可能。去年九月五國外長會議不歡而散於先，今年五月四國外長會議失敗於後，連一個和平會議也召開不成，還要談什麼國際合作？更談不到世界永久和平。這足以證明貝爾納斯致力和平，已歸於失敗，且已到了山窮水盡的關頭；但是貝爾納斯不折不撓，仍欲採取和平攻勢，務使其目的實現而已。這種剛毅堅決的精神，誠令人肅然起敬。</p>
<p>我們研究國際局勢，深知時局的癥結所在。簡言之，就是在英美與蘇聯之間，不能互信互忍，蘇聯對於英美保守原子彈的秘密，認為是威脅蘇聯，故指摘英美採取強權外交政策；此在英美，對於蘇聯的倔強頑固的態度，則將戰後所有國際會議失敗的責任，完全推諉於蘇聯。因此雙方互相攻擊，互相詆毀，無有已時。結果所屆，徒使國際局勢益陷於混亂狀態。</p>
<p>所以我們認為唯有下次外長會議能一致同意，召開歐洲和平會議，國際的僵局始有打開的希望；否則不顧蘇聯的參加與否，英美逕行召開和會，即使開成，對於世界和平的前途，也是毫無裨益的。貝爾納斯前天的演說，是對世界各國發出的警告，一則促起蘇聯的覺悟，立即改變態度，在下次外長會議中同意英美在今夏召開和會的主張；另則表示美國對於和平攻勢，具有絕大的決心，即使蘇聯不參加，美國也要召開和會，對於一切後果，均所不計。果爾，則國際局勢將來的發展，又添了一種新的因素。但望美國的和平攻勢能夠獲得最後勝利。</p>

<p>連日經吳聞先朱學範兩氏之斡旋，職工已於昨日下午復工，並曾開出定價車數輛，但因票務號衣等手續一時不及辦竣，故今日始能正式恢復行駛。吳朱兩氏均認為此次工潮，係由資方增加職員底薪之不合理而起，昨日下午二時朱氏親至赫德路廠內，向全體職工勸導解釋，職工要求推翻公司增職員底薪之舉，恢復年功加薪之公允辨法，且應自三月一日起實行。朱氏表示負責與公司當局商洽，並於三星期內答覆。此外職工因日來物價飛漲，要求每名借予十萬元，以濟眉急，吳朱兩氏亦允負責辦到。職工並表示為服從政府法令，停止罷工行為，願誠意與資方談判解決。</p>
<p>江海關</p>
<p>關務署長張福運臨時批准，允預借全體職工每人薪津一月，此與職工方面呈請發給一個月救濟金之要求，已相吻合，故僵持多日之工潮，即告急轉直下。全體職工聞訊後，當召集會議，旋於下午二時起，全體即告復工，一切恢復常態。據副總稅務司丁貴堂語記者：江海關全體職工預借一月薪津，所需之款至鉅，現正向中央銀行借支中，以便籌發。至日前呈請財部調整關員之辦法，尙未獲得批示。</p>
<p>西服業　經朱學範氏出任調解，職工已遵從朱氏之勸導，先行復工。由職工會通知各會員準備復工手續，如今日趕得及，則今日復工，否則需延至明日。同時社會局亦去文資方同業公會，通知職工復工之事。關於被捕十三職工中尙有一人未被釋放，朱氏允負責保釋。至各項條件及搗毀店號等事，當由朱氏負責與資方折衝商談，以謀解決。昨日職工會，並招待新聞界，報告職工所得低微，俾外界得明眞相，並稱決先行復工，靜候合理解決。</p>
<h3>借得水一個月書記錄事今銷假</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市高地兩院及檢察處全體書記官，錄事二百餘人，為物價飛漲，待遇菲薄，難以維持生活，因請司法當局作緊急救濟，並要求提高薪俸，昨日正午起全體總請假要求從速允准。業經兩院院長批准，每人預支薪俸一月，即本月底可領取一個半月之俸金，故決定今晨八時起，全體書記官錄事恢復辦公。</p>
<p>又昨日總請假期內，僅楊書記官大器，因礙於劉庭長毓桂之情面，被堅邀出庭辦公，事後因覺有違諸同事之信約，乃毅然提出辭呈，惟聞當局方面正竭力挽留中。</p>

<h3>全市國民身份證　一月後頒發完畢</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕頃據市府已政處消息：該處頒發國民身份證學，前因集中辦理選舉市參議員，致稍有躭擱。自選擇完畢後，該處第二科，即加緊整理。昨據該科科長陳璞語記者稱：各區國民身份證申請書，及索引冊等，頗多尙未送全者，且問有全部未曾送到者，故於頒發工作，頗受影響。據告目前每日可整理國民身份證十萬張，照此速度計算，全市國民身份證頒發完畢，為期約需一月。現除第九及第十九兩區，業已頒發完畢外，第十八區亦已於昨日發交該區區公所。</p>
<h3>袁履登再審一堂　其子具狀申請調查「善績」　昨略加審詢庭諭改期辯論</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕海上（三老）之一袁履登，高院特刑庭原定昨日下午開始辯論，殊料袁之家屬於事前轉告辯護人陳霆銳	·李寶森·巢紀梅三律師，宣稱袁於獄中患病，不克受審，需緩期再訊，故昨日開庭時被告辯護律師　均未到庭。而袁由法警提押上公堂時。身穿咖啡色長袍。足登黑布鞋。灰襪子鼻上架黑框眼鏡。髪已灰白。老態畢露，但精神猶佳。態度鎭靜，固未見一毫病色。據其供稱：僞米糧統制會有植田賢次郎等日籍委員五名。其子袁森齊曾具狀申請調查袁在上海之「善績」，以證明袁逆確有功於民者。其所要求調查之事有三：即（一）收買米糧之價格，確較前提高，（二）戶口米之配給，確曾盡力維持，（三）曾設立施粥廠，救濟貧民。經蕭庭長爕棻約略訊問一過後，即諭改期辯論。</p>
<p>邵鴻鑄　四十八歲，戰前在交通銀行服務，淪陷後被僞政府改組，邵即離職失業。及民國卅年一月，由其友任逆援道介紹入僞中央儲備銀行，任發行局副局長，卅二年二月，升任僞正局長，奉中儲行「總裁」周逆佛海，錢逆天　之命，辦理僞鈔收付，撥調及準備金之保管事宜，至勝利為止，共發行僞券達三萬萬又八千八百萬元。昨日提審一過，庭諭定本月二十八日下午二時半宣判。</p>
<p>李漢　德州人，三十三歲，住拉都路四三三弄一號，於民國三十一年入僞，曾在軍事方面迭任少校敎官及特務等工作。昨亦提審，諭廿九日下午二時宣判。</p>
<p>顧輯人　上海人四十四歲，住西摩路一一九弄八號；戰前經營雜糧業。民國卅二年九月起，經陳子彝之介紹，投入僞米糧經制曾任儲備處副處長。一年又七個月後，僞儲備處縮併入僞業務處，顧乃改任業務處副處長，據高檢處偵悉，顧曾供給敵軍登部隊等軍米二百萬石，僞軍警軍米四十萬石，提起公訴，昨開審時，顧對以米糧資敵資僞事，完全否認，據　：「我在米統會所做的事，是在雀巢鳩估之下，爭回米糧，配給平民」。言次，大有得意之狀。</p>

<h3>寗波路紗布公會內　發生離奇暗殺案　保衛團副隊長與公會會計　兩人慘死一室之內</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕上海市保衛團滬中區第三大隊第五中隊，設於寗波路紗布公會四十四號房間，對面四十六號住有浙江人田維仁，田</p>
<p>年逾不惑</p>
<p>，充任紗布公會會計之職，育有兩子，長子建中，任工務局專員，另住他處，次子建楙，尙在求學中，則與乃父同居。前晚八時，建中與其父某處宴會畢，用汽車伴送返寓，建中即遄歸已家。比至昨晨，建楙一覺醒來，不見其父，驚訝異常，遂致電乃兄詢問，當答以昨晚曾親至歸寓一面立即馳返遇所探視，果不見其父，因乃向對門四十四號保衛團機關叩詢其父行蹤，詎門戶緊閉，叩門久久不應，破扉而入，</p>
<p>忽見二屍</p>
<p>赫然呈於眼前。一處認明為保衛團第五中隊副隊長徐戰（河北人廿五歲），後腦中一槍，另一死者即係田維仁，右眼擊中一彈，均倒於地板上，鮮血四濺，厥狀殊慘。黃浦警局得報，由刑事股股長周光輝·率股員王克誠·傅連峰等，會同淞滬警備總司令部少校參謀陳銘堅，偵防第二隊李詩倩，保衛團吳銘鏞等，詳細查勘，瞥見法幣一包，計十餘萬元及手錶一只，仍置寫字檯上，尙有日本製造馬槍廿七枝，子彈二十餘粒，服裝多件，亦</p>
<p>完整無缺</p>
<p>，惟遺留木壳槍袋三只，手槍套四具。據陳參謀云死者徐戰，戰時曾服務於三民主義青年團行動總隊，嗣參加僞軍部隊，迨整編裁餘後，任警備司令部特務團第三營營附，經派往該中隊為副隊長，負責敎練工作，已將四月。此次之死，或係結怨仇殺所致。至田之慘死，顯係入睡後，聞聲探視，遂遭暴徒暗算，以為滅口之計。據一般推測，此驚人謀殺案，似含有</p>
<p>政治作用</p>
<p>，蓋兇手於達到目的後，仍極鎭靜，除將燈炮擊碎外，財物分文未動，彈壳一一檢去，故毫無痕跡可尋。昨午地檢處派員檢騐，當諭屍屬領殮，警務當局已飭屬嚴緝兇犯，務獲歸案究辦。</p>
<h3>上海婦女三團體　歡迎吳市長夫人　先有強壯之母親　才有強壯之子女　吳人勉勵婦女界注重衛生</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕上海市婦女新生活運動促進會，醫藥界婦女聯誼會，及精武體育會女子部三團體，昨日下午三時，假亞爾培路賽維納西菜社聯合歡迎吳市長夫人，到各該會代表等約七十人。</p>
<p>首由大會主席錢劍秋女士致詞稱：吳夫人學貫中西，輔助市長，在各方面努力，其賢德及成就，向為滬市同胞所敬仰。在此大時代中，婦女肩負之責任重大，在今後建國途中，更不能疏忽。上海婦女界希望為國出力，早具熱忱，此次幸得吳夫人蒞滬領導，實為全市婦女之榮。相信今後夫人定能給我們許多帮助及指示。上海環境雖然複雜，推動工作比較困難，但吳夫人在漢渝領導婦女工作，素具經騐，若本過去之經騐在滬進行，必有很大之表現，本人特代表上海婦女表示感激之意，並熱烈歡迎。</p>
<p>張湘紋　繼由人和醫院院長張湘紋女士報告：滬市淪陷學校被毀甚多，失學青年激增，婦運會會務雖告停頓，但仍竭力維持義務學校，並舉辦醫學助金及貧寒助學金，後又組織育嬰部，收留棄嬰或貧苦嬰孩，但均限於經濟，無從擴大發展，現得吳夫人出面領導，各種工作將可順利推進。</p>
<p>劉劍秋　醫藥界婦女聯誼會會長劉劍秋女士謂：數十年來中國婦女居於被動地位，現已漸漸改革，婦女有選舉及被選舉權，希望從此不再屆於被動地位，應担負起國家百分之五十的責任，今後能在吳夫人領導之下，更應努力效勞。家庭婦女對於造成健康思，加強國家力量乃最大責任，蓋預防往往勝過治療也。</p>
<p>吳夫人　吳市長夫人當即致答辭：表示能與新舊朋友見面，無限欣慰。並發表感想三點：（一）婦女對於醫學常識，家庭衛生，本身體格，均應特別注意，過去纏足時代完全係不合理制度，試問無健全體格如何有健全之國家，有強壯之母親才有強壯之子女。（三）今日見了許多女醫師女藥劑師等，本人非常高興，女子除了職業外，還要料理家務，這一點是我十分引以為榮的，婦女負有二重責任，不但在社會上服務，還負起家庭的責任。婦女對於衛生一項，務必隨時留意，夏天已經到了，在外國，虎列拉已成了過去的名詞，而在中國尙流行着，大家要早為預防。</p>
<p>交際應酬打算要不得</p>
<p>（三）由婦運會想起社會上有許多婦女，一旦結婚後即一事不問，整天沉緬於交際應酬打牌上面，置國事於腦後，這一點也是應該改革的。推動社會工作，由家庭婦女着手是最合適的。希望全市婦女能努力實行新生活，使建國必成。</p>
<p>婦運委員徐　瑞女士與吳夫人前曾在漢渝時共同工作，特起立介紹吳夫人之服務精神，稱其為「無名英雄」，因吳夫人辦事均埋頭苦幹，完成後從不作口頭宣傳。在漢口時，敵機狂炸漢口，吳夫人擔任兒童保育工作，救濟火綫上接來之難童，均親自往車站相接，安置於準備之房屋中，親自照料衣食，並手縫童服。在警報未解除時，常與吳市長赴各處慰問，此種精神，實為我國最需要者。</p>
<p>繼又由蘇祖斐醫師·陸禮華·姚季琅·朱素萼等發表演說，詞多勉勵，並表示願在吳夫人之指導下，努力邁進。</p>

<h3>吳市長首次出席分配房委會　佔住者一律勒遷　虹口十一條里弄先行處理　業廣公司迄未登記</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕行政院分配上海各機關房屋委員會，昨晨九時例會，由吳主任委員國楨及何副主任委員德奎出席舉行就職禮。會中吳主委發表談話，勗勉全體同人，繼續努力工作，增高工作效率，共同合作，以求處事合理。吳氏因近日公務繁忙，不及延長開會時間，故無其他討論。同時為便利以後開會起見，自下週起，每星期三例會，改在市府大禮堂舉行。</p>
<p>聞該會將於日內先行處理虹口區日僑及其他居民所住之十一里弄，其中義豐里	·東興里·大興里三弄，將用以集中日僑，其餘慶坊·源茂里·北四川里·東長安里·共和里·浙興里及壽蔭坊等里弄中，非法強佔之各住戶，均將勒令遷出，由該會強制執行　又外商地產公司造具清冊向該會登記者，除華商業廣公司外，已全部辦竣，現該會已再三催促該公司呈報，否則將予強制處理矣。</p>
<h3>追悼戴笠將軍定廿六日舉行</h3>

<h3>華工一批今日返滬　目前待遣送日僑俘　尙有三十萬名</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨據港口司令　　齡氏語本報記者稱：最近遣送日俘工作，已因發生虎列拉而稍受影響，惟渠深信在六月底前當可全部完成。日前尙待遣送之日俘日僑約計三十萬，計漢口十六萬（內日僑一萬）在途中者六萬，已集中上海者八萬，將來日僑抵滬，決集中復興　，俾前指定之虹口區日僞房屋即可由分配房屋會加以運用，本月底起每日遣送人數可增加至一萬名以上。至於　國光復軍昨亦有一批返國，計二千六百名，現留滬者僅千餘名。</p>
<p>又訊：戰時被日非法招募之華工一批一千四百人，可能於今日午後搭自由輪抵滬，本市當局已派員屆時前往招待。</p>
<h3>殉情明德里槍聲</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨晚十時半，洛陽路明德里發生一開槍案，緣有吳介池者，年三旬，平日穿西裝戴眼鏡，去秋　一吳江女子袁立秀（二十六歲）情好逾恒，不料袁有未婚夫同鄉人名沈玉清（三十歲），一月前由重慶返滬，即擬舉行婚禮。吳由妨生恨，致起毒念，偵知沈有一戚居明德里一〇一號，袁亦常至其家。吳乃預伏於弄側，當時瞥見袁由該號外出，即拔槍狙擊，中其右眼角，貫穿左頸應聲倒地。同時吳又向自己右腦開放一槍，傷要害畢命。事後由盧家灣分局組長薛敏傑卒警員高賢才·馮伯鈞前往調查，將袁飛送醫院，聞性命已危。在出事地點檢得六寸手槍一支，內存子彈五粒。死者身畔抄出當票五張，襪一雙，遺書兩通。遺書一致情敵沈玉清，大致謂立秀早在去年八月許身於余，且懷孕兩月等語。一致其兄嫂，謂患略血症痼疾，終不久於人世云云。</p>
<h3>衛生局女職員　于歸有期忽爾仰毒</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市衛生局第二衛生所女職員陳冰玉，又名貞榕，（廿三歲松江人）家居南市董家渡蔡陽弄十三號，於十三歲時，由父母之命，許配於同鄉人雷嘉駿為室，不久即將舉行婚禮，兩人情感頗篤。其未婚夫現供職於南京公路總局工務處，平日魚雁時通。當上月間其未婚夫曾來滬遊玩，住宿陳女家中，達十餘天之久，詎陳冰玉忽於前日今晚五時半，在家中潛服毒藥自殺身死。據該管警局調查結果，自殺原因，除因不久將舉行婚禮，而其未婚夫及伊本人均為經濟所困，以致鬱鬱寡歡，恒抱消彬，此外其母對女有不諒解之處，陳女受此雙重刺激，遂憤而自戕云。</p>
<h3>工潮物價等問題　江一平發表意見</h3>
<p>法學家江一平氏，日前由後方返滬，記者訪晤於其寓所，并叩詢對於本市一般問題之意見，茲將江氏談話略記如下：（一）物價上漲，均係供求問題，如市府能發揮人民力量，在各業自由採運，遇有困難，並盡力予以協助，則物資湧進，物價自平。（二）關於工潮問題，勞資雙方必須通力合作，增加生產，以求生活之安定，故廠方必須體念工人之勞苦，工人亦應體諒廠方統籌之艱巨，若相互對立，一旦工廠停閉，勢將引起失業問題，勞資均有不利；最好工廠當局能於事前將廠內眞實狀況，昭告工人，並每設身處地代工人着想，以喚起工人之眞摯同情，則工潮決不致發生。本人在四川獨立支持兩個酒精工廠，在最不景氣時代，仍能與工人澈底合作，蓋工人已視工廠如家庭，廠主為家長，自無工潮之可言也。（三）警管區之設計，在警局方面，余信其並無侵犯人民自由之惡意，但警察以代人民服務為天職，今人民對於此項制度旣普遍感有不安，則警局處以勉循民意為合宜，若吾人不推求警局之動機，遽予警局以激烈之　評，將有礙市民與市政當局合作精神之推進云云。</p>
<h3>衡陽災荒亘古未有　發起商人節食運動　市商會籲請各業響應</h3>
<p>上海市商會，以接湖南衡陽市商會急電，此次衡陽災荒，為亘古所未見，千餘萬同胞，無從覓食，餓　載道，慘絕人寰，災情之重，災區之廣，實駭聽聞。衡陽商會，目擊心傷，如坐針氈，在此青黃不接之期，尤屬生死關頭，爰發起商人節食運動，電請上海商界亟起響應，以救垂絕之災黎。上海市商會接電後，經提付常務會議，一致議決響應，籲請本市各業實行商人節食運動，如蒙捐助現金，不論多寡，可　交該會彙轉。</p>
<h3>敵僞強佔民產　從速澈底清查</h3>
<p>程監察使中行，鑒於敵僞產業之接管與使用，雖經政府一再規定及補充辦法，而辦理仍多紛歧，致原屬民有，在淪陷時期，為敵僞所攫取或強佔使用部份，延不發還，使人民最感失望與痛苦，特電監院，轉請中央主管機關，嚴令所屬，加意整飭，從速澈底清查。</p>

<h3>首都臨大補習班學生　要求無條件分發　向敎育部請願未准　學生留部過宿始散　敎授勸告仍須考試</h3>
<p>〔本報南京專訊〕首都臨時大學補習班，借金大校舍上課，原約至四月底歸還校舍，經杭次長斡旋，（杭係金大校長陳裕光之妹丈），延借至五月底，故該班能延期至五月底結束，已定自二十開始考試。該班有一部份學生，主張再延長一月結束，當提出五項意見：（一）延期至六月底結束，（二）所讀學分要分發之校一律承認，（從前有些大學對新生從前所學，診斷成績不佳時，得令重行補習學分，但考試成績及格者，可免此患），（三）保留分發權一年，（即是被分者，一時不到校，在一年以內，仍可入該校）。（四）公布分發學校名稱，及各該校支配收容本班生之名額，（五）考試成績不及格者，不按照部頒標準，要一律分發。而實際最要者，即是一律無條件分發，因組織糾察隊，阻止不附從同學考試，並封鎖其宿舍。</p>
<p>向敎部請願</p>
<p>於二十日上午九時，集合四百餘人，到敎部請願。該班主任王書林，同到教部，阻止無效，由學生代表數人請見高等敎育司司長周鴻經。周說明金大員生來京需用校舍，不得不及時結束，敎部頒布分發辦法，學校絕無不論成績升學者，并對要求各點加以解釋理論，勗以大義，望守法應考。學生認為不滿，乃先後在敎部大禮堂及荷花池前空塲，集合開會，聲言非達到要求目的不可，并有時高呼三聲口號，要求朱部長訓話，朱次長訓話，杭次長訓話，因值陰雨，敎部職員到塲，以求大義，勸學生離開雨地，勿自尋苦惱。學生移時，乃改在大禮堂集合，經學生代表與王書林主任多次向敎部請求。</p>
<p>杭次長訓話</p>
<p>至晚燈已上，杭次長乃向學生訓話，約分數點：（一）金大校舍已經迭次情商，始得以五月底為度，且中大金大兩校，即將有六千人來京，補習班至五月底結束，勢非得已，（二）各大學尙未呈報表冊，無從預先支配分發各校名額，（三）升學之分發辦法，知識青年從軍復學之分發，先修班優秀學生之分發，皆有標準依行，不獨補習班學生如此，行政所定辦法，理應遵行，勢難變通，（四）青年力圖上進，而家在匪區者，敎部對力爭上游之學生，自應為之想法救濟，（五）本人對學生福利事業，向來注重，如倡辦世界學生服務社等，希望各生勿徇一時感到蠢動，要循軌守法，有事儘可用書面建議，勿棄眾請願。杭次長辭畢而退，已逾七點，各生認為目的未達，仍留部不去，問有少數不辭而別，大多數仍在敎部會客各室過夜，至廿一日清晨六點而散。</p>
<p>敎授會勸導</p>
<p>該班敎授會常務理事會，臨時召集緊急會議，謂如此要不求，實不合理，（無論何校，即如小學生升學，亦須經過考試），勸勉學生必須考試之後，始可以言分發。學生無異議。廿一日，由王主任書林出布告云：茲准本班敎授會常務理事會建議，本班結束考試期，順延三日，自五月廿四日（星期五）起，照原定程序舉行，以便各生復習學業，并於下午四時開全體敎授聯席會議，準備考試事宜，此事可告一段落云。（愚）</p>
<h3>北平臨大工學院學生　反對合辦共管　要求恢復獨立工學院</h3>
<p>〔本報北平訊〕北平臨大第五分班，原係工學院。該班全體學生，為反對北大，清華合辦共管，要求成立獨立工學院事，於本月十六日上午九時，全班學生九百餘人整隊遊行，首赴臨大總班往訪陳雪屏主任。學生代表當要求陳主任即電敎育部，准工學院獨立，並請敎部於三日內答覆。陳主任表示渠無此權力，對同學之要求極表同情，願盡力奔走。最後並謂「共管」似有「併吞」之意，渠願代表北大當局決無併吞之意，僅為奉政府命令辦理。該隊繼赴行營，適李主任未在，由蕭一山秘書長接見，說明行營方面，對工學院應獨立一事，深表同情，並出示已擬就之呈主席意見書，各生表示大體滿意，乃辭出，赴政院駐平辦事處及監察使署請願，均予以接見，並允轉電敎部。直至下午二時，全班學生始整隊回校。頃刻院學生為反對合辦共管，要求恢復獨立，特發表宣言如下：</p>
<p>告全國同胞書</p>
<p>親愛的全國同胞們：敝分班學生數近九百，以人數論，為全國工學院之冠，以程度論，亦非淺陋，且校址為前北平工學院之舊地，確具有獨立性工學院之條件，然政府在此建國之初，竟欲將敝分班暫由清華與北大二校合辦，聞訊不勝驚訝。蓋因北大旣無辦理工學院之經騐，清華工學院僅能容納四百人，而對我九百同學無力兼顧合辦之法，顯係臨時敷衍之性質。敝分班之前身為平大工學院，創於前清光緒年間，沿革已久，成績昭著，抗戰以來，雖受敵人種種壓迫，然設備敎師及課程方面，尙無甚變動，數年以來，全體師生仍保持舊平大工學院之校風，不曾有所改變，抗戰勝利之今日，自應恢復此校，以繼續造就有用之人材。今由清華北大暫時合辦，決不能長期繼續，換言之，即不能永久造就造福國家社會之人材。國家以同一校址，相等經費，不恢復永久性之工學院，而仍造成合辦之臨時大學，實毫無理由。我國工業敎育如不迅速發展，地下寶藏，將何以開採，大好山河，將何以利用，工業不振，國本不固，將何以與諸盟邦並駕齊驅？敝分班學生有鑒及此，曾召開全體大會，一致通過下列決義：（甲）堅決反對不合理措置。（一）應與其他工學院享受同時待遇（如清華，交大，北洋等工院，皆將恢復）。（二）北平臨時大學八分班，而其七已有正當歸宿，獨工學院暫時合辦共管，實為不當。（三）大學共管，為中外史所未有之空前措置。（乙）中國需要大批工業人材來建設國家，唯有依需要而發展之獨立性工學院，才能滿足此項要求，而本分班有成獨立學院之資格。（一）歷史悠久，自清末迄今。（二）畢業校友，遍於全國，於抗戰功績卓著。（三）本分班擁有九百人，為全國工學院之冠，並無大學能容納之。（四）現有之設備，實可為發展中國工業敎育之基礎。敝分班九百同學，以十二分熱誠，呼籲全國同胞，願得到有力的響應與支援，促使政府早日接受我們合理的要求，北平臨時大學補習班第五分班（工學院）學生自治會啓。</p>

<h3>北平中國大學將復校　美人渴望來華就學　已有一部分美國學生到達北平</h3>
<p>〔合眾社北平廿二日電〕此間之「中國大學」，可於本年十月一日復校。此美人所辦之著名大學，在珍珠港事件發生後，曾被日人封閉，現在錄取學生名單上，已有入學生一百名之多。馮亨利博士來此已三週，刻正研究有關從速復校之各項問題，渠希望在六月一日前，完成其調查工作。按馮博士在過去三年間，一向擔任中國湘雅大學敎職。渠稱：美人中渴望來華就學才，為數頗多，有若干人業已到達北平，因彼等認為該校已經復校。中國大學係由十五不同單位之美國敎會所資助，此外尙有中國敎育基金會之加州大學。支援該校之教會，其單位數目，較戰前已增三倍。現正擬訂計劃，以資助研習華文之美國學生，俾便留華深造。</p>

<h3>四強籃球第二幕　良會今晚戰汕隊　前奏插曲記者同發會師</h3>
<p>四強籃球奪標賽，日前揭幕，良華旗開得勝，擊敗不可一世之信號隊，汕隊則不幸以一球之袏，受挫於西青。今日下午在市體育館展開第二幕，門票仍售樓下二千，樓上一千，及塲內榮譽座一萬元，前發長期贈券停止使用，軍警一律購票入塲，除原有二塲節目外，六時起增加前奏曲一支，由記者與名伶組織之同發隊交鋒，屆時除難民難童收容所樂隊，仍到塲奏樂外，並由格致中學童子軍，維持撤，三塲秩序如下：</p>
<p>同發—記者（友誼賽）　下午六時</p>
<p>信號—西青（奪標賽）　下午七時</p>
<p>良華—汕隊（奪標賽）　下午八時</p>
<p>名伶登塲</p>
<p>同發與記者之戰，首先登塲，同發係名伶組織，如鬚生李宗義，武生李盛斌，小生高維廉等，不但蜚聲於紅氍毺上，而對籃球一項，亦極有心理。李宗義與良華諸將，均極熟稔，昔日曾同隸一隊，故其球藝超羣，該隊日前甫敗胖隊，足見其戰鬥力之充沛。記者隊自成軍以還戰績不弱，屢挫強敵，威震體壇，麾下如王微君，周濬，錢旭滄，許桂強，曹錫珍，金家標等，亦久戰沙塲，陣容堅強，當可與名伶一決雌雄。</p>
<p>奪標比賽</p>
<p>奪標賽七時起，信號與西青角逐，兩隊技術各具千秋，信號進攻迅速，投籃準備，惟守來較為鬆懈，隊長塞摩勒，短小精悍，最為可畏，日前旣受辱於良華，今當力圖振作，以求一逞，西青係巨人與恩卡斯聯軍，巨人曾於市長盃決賽中，以一分之差，敗於信號，則此番正復仇之良機，望諸健兒奮起爭鬥，湔雪前恥。</p>
<p>良華出馬</p>
<p>末塲良華對汕隊八時開始，良華前晚一仗，擊退信號，揚眉吐氣，恢復昔日英名，李震中指揮若定，三軍靈魂，沈聿獲分之　，而劉福善張少卿南派之良材，表演優異，相得益彰，今夜二度出馬，必有更美妙之演出。汕隊此次健將歸來，重整旗鼓，賴其快速之擋人戰術，於日前對西青一仗中，發揮無遺，殊為可惜，今對良華，雖箕豆相煎，但亦必奮力相搏，屆時演出緊張，蓋可預卜。</p>
<p>又籃委會為增厚經費收入，盼望熱心人士，踴躍捐款，日前已由程伯庵君慨助一百萬元，將來在體育館內鑄建銅牌一方，刋出捐款者姓氏，以資永久紀念。今晚六隊出塲人馬錄下：</p>

<h3>蔣湘青敎授談　上海為中國之體育首都　體育之動態與發展必須重視心理建設　學西洋貴學得其致用勿徒學其享用</h3>
<p>本市體育始創人蔣湘青敎授，在別離九年後，於日前請假由筑返滬。顧局長獲悉，即畀予市體育塲塲長一席，挽被留滬服務，渠正考試中。渠於戰時主持武大五年後，即赴國立貴陽師範學院創辦體育科，培植大後方師資，開發西南體育，貢獻殊大。著有「體育與人生」一書，都二十萬言，除得敎育部學術審議會之專門著作獎勵金外，並經該部正式核定其敎授資格，此為我國體育界非留學生中取得教授證書之第一人。近年渠仍繼續其研究工作，補充並修正其作品，期於政局安定後，付梓問世。中華敎育文化基金董事會特給特別研究補助金，用竟其志。氏之被聘為獨立學院敎員資格升等審查委員，取得崇高之學術地位，亦正以此。查體育敎授膺此殊榮，實足為其同儕張目。據氏談稱：上海不僅為我國之經濟首都，實亦我國之體育首都。體育在工業都市中，休閑教育的價值，自當高於一切，但除以消遣娛樂為目的外，尙須不忘其更遠大之意義—即改造後一代，承擔現代國民之重負是。故其發展，萬不可與敎育脫節而背馳。良以全國唯上海之馬首是瞻，必須做出好榜樣，供人矜式，不為識者詬病。三等體格，造不起頭等國家，四強之一尊稱，非口宣傳所能使之名實相符，是則造人，實猶重於造產。如何造人，不外二途：（一）必須認識體育為勞務的一種，所異於一般勞務者，祇穿上了一套快樂的衣服，及僅能間接生產而非直接生產耳。所謂間接生產，即學了體育，必須提高其工作效能，生產於無形，收穫於有形。如為學生，則必須能加其課業與品德。總之，運動塲與工作崗位之間，絕對應有一橋樑可通。若將此一橋樑截斷，則體育為浪費，體育人亦為消耗者而非生產者，就社會問題講，且是一種罪行，正如家庭中有一病人，非特少一生產者，並尙須若干不病之人，向彼提送湯藥，同其消耗人力與物力也。浪費的消耗的體育，尙非現階段經濟極度貧弱的中國所需要，我們學西洋以維新，必須學得其「致用」，不可徒學其「享用」，至少在中國尙未走上現代之路以前，必須強調此一主張，因我人猶未具備體育享用之資格也。（二）單純的生理健康，無裨國族，必心理同樣健康，始能對小我與大我有貢獻。生理不健康固為一種罪行，而心理不健康實為一種更大之罪行。此一國父心理建設之所以重，為我體育界及愛好體育之人士所不可不黽勉者。故體育首都之稱，任重而道遠，名高而離居，實足發人深思云云。</p>

<p>（三）陳克昌問　敝人前向三房東乙租得店面一間，言明杜被間公用，共住房客七戶，該灶間原係用鉛皮搭出，八年未加修葺，破爛不堪，爰向甲乙修葺，然乙答以無力裝修，甲答云將鉛皮及樓板全數拆除，估計需費五十萬元，擬由所有住戶公攤，而遭拒絕，請問（一）敝人獨資修理，而甲方定欲拆除而阻止，應如何處置？（二）裝修費甚鉅，如由敝人獨修，仍歸公用，而灶披樓上可否要求讓與敝人居住？甲方是否有權阻止？</p>
<p>〔端木愷律師答〕（一）該灶披間如有使用必要，祇能要求乙修繕。（二）該灶披樓如向係乙使用，則乙旣同意，自無問題。</p>

<h3>桐油外銷不動</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕白桐油轉輾盤旋，毫無蹊景，乃近日漢桐續有大批到貨，致市面疲弱不堪，查植物油類，食油一再漲價，獨桐油依然如故，人心難免不服，然而去路不同，蓋桐油全靠外銷，現出口貿易尙未調整，致業出口者無從發展，市面因之絕少變動，造成長疲短俏之局勢，本埠售價近又稍廉，白桐油六萬六千元，西副洪江桐油每桶八萬二千元·本地洪油六萬三四千元。</p>
<p>戰前桐油，每年出口數量，恒達七萬噸以上，榨製桐油之桐籽·戰前價格，倍於穀價，戰時僅及三分之一，川湘鄂諸省，農民因增產糧食，而將桐樹砍伐者，比比皆是。</p>
<p>我國近年桐油產量，雖無正確統計，然就勝利迄今，由滬輸出數字，據悉，尚不足二千噸，而川，陝，桂，湘，鄂，浙，皖，諸產桐區域，近八年來出口斷絕，各地存積，亦極薄弱，國內交通未盡暢達，運輸實多困難，但外銷不動，縱使貨運無阻，市面仍難起色，又桐油之輸出，較其他物資爲難者，因其價輕貨重，故在勝利時風起雲湧之出口商，曾經一時之活躍，現復吿冷寂，經營是項出口商現多緊縮業務或改營進口貿易，以靜待將來發展</p>
<p>美國方面極需桐油，紐約價格較戰前已提漲三倍，（現每磅爲三角八分）但以我國一般農作物價値之高貴，此種價値，仍與國內相差甚遠云。</p>

<h3>揚子江大水閘偉大設計者　薩凡奇博士素描</h3>
<p>— 本報編譯室特譯</p>
<p>如果你想物色一位工程師，在密士失必河，亞馬孫河或其他鉅大的河流上而建築一座水閘，利用水力發電以供家庭及工業應用的話，你得去找薩凡奇博士，惟有他纔能解決這問題。</p>
<p>看上去，他好像一位謹嚴而和藹的老祖父，實際上，却是散佈在各地的許多靑年的歡喜遊伴。他不吸烟，不飲酒，也不出口駡人，可是他曾經徒步或騎馬，越過返洛基山，希馬拉耶山和其他險峻的山嶺。</p>
<p>六十六歲　依然孜孜服務</p>
<p>薩凡奇博士所設計的大水閘，比歷史上任何人所設計的爲多。許多國家，現在正渴望着他的指導。依照他所計劃的圖樣而造成的水閘，至少有六十座之多，價値在十億美元以上。他所設計建造的水力發電廠所發生的電力之强，恐非愛迭生所能夢想得到。</p>
<p>薩凡奇博士曾經在胡佛總統任期內，主持哥羅拉多州波爾達水閘的打樣事宜。這在常時是一件空前艱鉅的水閘工程。後來，薩氏又替羅斯福總統設計兩座更大的發電及灌漑水閘，即哥倫比亞河上的古里大水閘——亦即今日世界上最大的人造建築物——和加利福尼亞州的沙斯泰水閘。</p>
<p>你也許以爲薩凡奇博士旣經建立下這許多偉大的成績，現在年届六十六歲的高齡，也該歸田吿老了，的確，自從一九〇三年一直到去年，除了八年的間歇外，他替美國墾務局孜孜服務，可從來沒有歇手過。然而，這位水閘建築的巨擘現在正潛心從事於一個空前偉大的計劃。</p>
<p>工程龐大　開鑿隧道廿條</p>
<p>這個計劃，就是把幾百萬磅的水泥堆置於世界第四大河揚子江三峽中，而發生五倍於古里大水閘的電力。利用揚子江水力的理想是由中國國父孫中山先生所首先發動的。蔣主席對於薩凡奇博士的偉大計劃非常感奮，決定借重這位美國的水閘專家來協助中國開發一切的天然資源。</p>
<p>薩凡奇博士的揚子江水閘工程，差不多等於把密士失必河灌入大涸谷而後堵塞起來。哥羅拉多的波爾達水閘，和它比較起來，何啻小巫見大巫了。</p>
<p>在此龐大工程的所在地，上面是削壁千似，下面是波濤洶湧。薩凡奇博士估計需要排出的水量，五倍於波爾達水閘，因此，他得從山石中開鑿直徑五十英尺的隧道二十條，因爲波爾達水閘鑿有同樣的隧道四條。</p>
<p>揚十江水閘工程的代價，估計需美金十億元。水閘築成後，可使航行大洋的巨輪溯江而上，行駛一千餘英里，直達陪都重慶。</p>
<p>世界上最大的水閘閘門，至多能使船隻升起五六十英尺。現在薩凡奇博士擬建立一個龐大無比的閘門和隧道設備，使巨輪從隧道裏進去，然後用巨大的起重機吊起五百三十英尺到閘門的頂部</p>
<p>在揚子江水閘的電力分佈區域裏，住着一萬萬四千萬居民，等於美國的全人口。薩氏計劃實現後，這一個東方遼闊而落後的區械，將初步沾到工業化的利益。現代的灌漑系統，將賦與幾百萬畝的舊式田地以新的生命，同時，揚子江的水患也可從此消滅了</p>
<p>薩氏計劃　中美雙方有利</p>
<p>這一件事，對於全世界的政治和外交局面，顯然有着重大的影響。有些人以爲落後的中國即使有鉅大的工業潛勢力，也不知道怎樣去利用它。也有人覺得中國富强以後，將予美國製造商以一種威脅，因此，不贊成美國政府或銀行家資助中國的揚子江計劃。在此項計劃得到美國全融界的帮助以前，華府的官塲須得從長硏究，以決定此項開發遠東的計劃是否與美國有利。</p>
<p>贊成這個計劃的人都說它對於美國是有利的。他們說建立一個强盛的中國，把四萬萬五千萬美國之友的人民出水火而登袵席，是有利於美國的，因爲美國需要中國協力維持遠東的和平。此外，假如中國永遠貧窮飢饉，美國的工商界決不能獲得貿易的利益。中國工業化以後，美國可得到四萬萬五千萬的好主顧。</p>
<p>已故羅斯福總統，爲了協助中國解決戰時生產問題，曾特派前戰時生產局局長納爾遜來華訪問。納爾遜在重慶遇到薩凡奇博士，聽到他的計劃以後，大爲興奮，立刻拍電到華盛頓去，竭力推薦薩氏的計劃。常薩氏的工程圖樣寄達華盛頓時，國務院裏的一部份官員似乎不很感到興趣。後經納爾遜的戲吹，終於去年秋間，美國墾務局和中國政府簽訂了五十萬美元的合同，駐在鄧佛總局的美國　務局工程師就根據此項合同，開始硏究該項計劃的細節，並有在鄧佛地方的中國工程師從旁協助。薩凡奇博士便正式擔任中國的設計工程師。</p>
<p>鬚眉皤然　態度溫文謙和</p>
<p>薩凡奇博士有着高大的身段，皤然的鬍鬚，態度異常溫文謙和。一對烱烱有光的碧眼，嵌在因多年戶外工作而變成黝黑的臉上。一直到去年爲止，他每年所支領的政府俸給，從來超過八千七百五十元，但是薩凡奇毫不介意。他說：「我不是一個精明的商人。對於金錢，並不感到多大興趣。」</p>
<p>薩凡奇於一八七九年聖誕節，生於威斯康新州柯克斯維爾附近的小農塲。長大以後，在麥迭遜地方的威斯康新大學裏攻讀工程科。畢業後，不久即入美國墾務局任事。</p>
<p>薩氏的第一件工程是伊大和州南部蛇河的治水工程，每天十四小時的工作，在他是慣常的一回事。數年以後，有名惠來的工程師邀他加入他的公司，兩人共同設計建築水閘，曾發明許多新奇的意匠。薩氏至今常對人說：「我的工程學識，是惠來傳授的。」</p>
<p>一九一六年，薩凡奇先生重入美國墾務局，數年後，他變成了鄧佛總局的工程設計主任。薩氏對於建築水閘的經騐漸漸豐富起來。一九二〇年，他奉政府命令建築哥羅拉多河上的波爾達水閘。這是世界上第一座大水閘，由美國西部的六大建築公司共同投資，足見規模的偉大。薩氏在這件艱鉅的工程中，發明一種使三百五十萬立方碼的水泥冷却的新方法。</p>
<p>到了羅斯福時代，各地的建築計　如雨後春笋，盛極一時，　凡奇和他的問事加緊工作，趕製國樣，以應需要。當他在巴本馬時，他突然奉急召主持坦納西流域水利工程（ＴＶＡ），担任諾立斯和維勒水閘的設計主任。接着又主持古里及沙斯泰兩水閘的設計事宜。不久，薩凡奇的大名便傳遍世界各地，各國政府紛紛拍電到華盛頓去，邀請薩氏給予指導。</p>
<p>澳洲新南威爾斯邦恐怕那裏的柏林吉克水閘沒有專家管理，有崩潰的危險，特地電邀薩氏前往倫敦參加工程師緊急會議。在他動身的當兒，有人發見美國有一條法律禁止美國公務員接受外國薪給。降氏便發電給他的上司聲明願意不受任何酬報，於是便出發前往倫敦。</p>
<p>後來，美國國會在一九四一年通過一條法案，准許總統選派薩凡奇前往澳洲及印度。他便前往澳洲實地踏勘柏林吉克水閘。此時適値日軍進襲珍珠港，薩氏從澳洲回國途中，幾次遭遇潛水艇的危險，但是因爲他忙於繕寫報吿，並沒有注意到這些危險。</p>
<p>水閘專家　關懷中國問題</p>
<p>一九四四年，薩氏出發前往中國取道印度，阿富汗，最後到了中國的陪都。他看到了揚子江三峽水閘的可能性－可能產生十倍於波爾達水閘的電力一千零五十萬基羅瓦特－他生平所經辦的建築工程，（包括波爾達水閘工程在內）就渺乎其小了。</p>
<p>這位全世界的水閘專家是素來關心中國問題的·他在報吿中說：揚子江的開發計劃，可列爲人類史上偉蹟之一。他深信此項計劃的完成，將使中國轉弱爲强。</p>
<p>但是懷疑這一個計劃的人說：中國人的能力太差，永遠造不起這座起想的水閘，即使造得起，也不會好好利用它。然而，如果你去問薩凡奇，他對中國工程師的能力覺得怎樣時，他會拿出在中國寫成的四篇報吿，爽直地吿訴你說：「這幾篇報吿能够寫得這樣完備，這樣迅速。完全靠了二三十位中國靑年工程師的帮助。其中有幾位是在美國有過建築經騐的，另外幾位現在還在鄧佛地方帮助完成最後的設計。」</p>
<p>他又說：「毫無疑義的中國已經踏上工業發展的戶檻，正和幾十年前美國的情形沒有兩樣。誰說中國不會像我們一樣的得到成功呢？」</p>
<h3>黃河工程新略　淮運兼治　裕國福民的前提條件</h3>
<p>— 十四日濟南通訊　孟明</p>
<p>南中運河之存廢問題：運河爲以往皇帝運漕之卸用糧道，自宋室南遷，恐遝道資敵，下令破壞，而規制蕩然。明初本沿元制，利用海運，壞船甚多，乃以平江伯陳瑄尙書宋禮分浩南北運河，以轉輸江南之糧赴京，爲惟一目的。當開河之初，未嘗詳審地勢，計及水利民生，以作萬全之策，於是一恃人力矯揉造作，强驅河淮汶濟爲一綫，以微山洪澤高寳諸湖爲逆旅。諸河之趨向不一，蓄洩不同，於是堤堰閘壩，雜置其間，設官戌卒，日夜守望。然而水性難馴，不能久服，潰溢堙塞，變遷不常，補救苞苴，大工屢興。越河也，中堤也，老堤也，淸水潭也，高家堰也，泇河也，中河也，新河也，洽水之名臣輩出，每役皆動民伕數萬，或數十萬，用銀數十萬兩，或數百萬兩，旋修旋毁，卒無補於運道之敝壞不通。今也每上之巨艦可航，陸路之軌道已通，帝王之天庚不存，則此勞民糜財，供給朝廷之運河，其價値實有另行考慮之必要。江都淮陰問之運河，日南運河，淮陰至微山湖間之運河，曰中運河。此兩段運河，與治黃有密切關係，治運意見，亦附塵於此，餘者離黃較遠，則不具論。</p>
<p>西運河</p>
<p>洪譯湖爲淮河之尾閭者數百年，湖底淤淺，容水之量，逐年減小，每値淮漲，洪澤湖即不能容，澎湃浩渺，匯爲巨浸，更兼高寳邵伯諸湖，漭瀁三百餘里，粘天無涯，不獨湖濱田盧，有昏墊之塵，且常冲次運堤，淹沒裏下河）帶，爲害爲烈，故宜乘此黃淮並治之時，洪澤等湖，與以澈底之整理，由眙盱（適當地點在盯眙東北洪澤湖之中心）至江都，遵實業計劃，開一運河，經洪澤高寳諸湖中心，南入長江，北通黃河，（新道）名爲西運河，使諸湖之水，分入江河，涸爲沃壤，增加耕田，農產之收穫，地價之收人，可充開河經費，倘使解甲之士治河，則涸出之田，歸之解甲之士。</p>
<p>東運河</p>
<p>南運河以東，高實等七縣之地，舊稱下河一帶，故有射陽廣洋等三十六湖，形如釜底，爲淮河及滁泗天長諸水之尾閭，伏秋水漲，各水以下河爲壑，不舍晝夜，越運河而東注，然東海之濱，又有范公堤，以障海潮，下河之水，又被阻不得入海，停蓄橫流，漫田沒村，終古成爲澤國，故下河一帶，苦水患最深，統計下河之地，有由約三十萬頃，能耕者十之四，爲湖者十之六，茲黃河新道旣成，滁鳳淮泗之水，又分由西運河及黃河人江歸海，則下河一帶，不受上河之害，惟當地積水，尙須排除，是宜通接長江黃河（新道），開一新運河，命名爲東運河，藉以疏導下河一帶積水，分人江河，多年沮洳之地，變爲穰穰杭稻之鄕，不獨東運河爲溝通江河之第一通衢，且涸出沃田十數萬頃，國家收益，亦非淺鮮。</p>
<p>南運蔞</p>
<p>本河河身，高於洪澤等湖六尺，高於淮者數丈，運河無源，故水力維艱，動須人力疏治，時至今日，而鄭重以治運爲務，實屬得不償失，倘東西運河已開，疏水濟航，必著明效，則此更無耗費大量人力金錢，從事火規模工事之必要，只可稍事浚渫，維持小舟通行即可，然高寳興泰鹽各屬，向賴運堤涵洞啓閉，以灌田畝，故宜利用運堤，節制水量，以裕灌漑之利，黃河長江東運河西運河，四水結成一方形地帶，四河圍繞，其中必饒水利，在此方形地帶中，開掘東西平行河渠若干，西起西運河，東通東運河，支渠溝洫，遍達田內引西運河之水，輸送渠中，遍灌諸田，其南運河堤之各涵洞，以時啓閉藉以調劑裏下河一帶之水量，雨晹因火，蓄洩在人，江淮千里之間，嚮之連年苦水者，今則港汶縱橫，舉目沃壤，蔚然魚米之鄕，財賦充盈，媲美江南矣。</p>
<p>中運河</p>
<p>明時淮陰至微山湖之運道，利用黃河，以濟漕運，因避呂梁　之險，萬歷間，李化龍開泇河，由韓莊以述直河口，避黃河三百餘里之險，終以皂河至淸口一段黃河險難，重運運滯，康熙間，又開鑿中河，泇河中河，合爲中運河，觀其開河動機，全　補綴性質，旋浚旋淤，澇浚極費人力，且韓莊台兒莊之間，八十里之遙，置閘九門，尤爲地勢不平之證，矯揉造作，不便航行，亦不可大興工事，勞民害財，稍事疏浚通行小舟即可，惟爲貫通南北運河起見，宜由眙盱西運河之口，利用汴泗支諸水，向北開闢運河一道，經徐州以入微山湖，壩韓莊運河舊口，使微山湖常年蓄水，以濟運道，再北藉汶泗之水，以通臨淸天津，韓莊淮陰盱胎之間，因黃河（新道）中運河新中運河之圍繞，成一三角地帶，亦可東西開渠數道，藉資灌溉疏洩，徐泗數百里之間，桑麻之野，稻粳之川，交織綜錯，易荒凉之境，爲富庶之域矣。</p>
<p>運河與黃河交會之處，曰運口，運河水弱，黃河水强，故黃河之水，常倒灌運口，黃水入運，水力分散，下游流緩沙墊，發生壅塞，下游壅塞，則上游潰次，是黃河倒灌運口，爲患甚大，不可不防，凡運河各口人黃之處，俱應避用仰角，改用俯角，庶黃運之水，交會下注，不至倒灌爲患。</p>
<h3>徵工：三種來源</h3>
<p>治黃計劃，包括治淮治運，工程偉大，以多數之人伕，任長期之工作，對於徵用人伕辦法，應釐訂專章，以期組織嚴整，指揮靈活，工作可獲速效，人伕來源，分爲以下三種：</p>
<p>（甲）編餘士兵</p>
<p>現時整軍，業已着手，編餘士兵，可以祖任治河工作，將來治河成功，上下游新涸拓荒之田，必不在少，按人授田，使解甲之士，有田可歸。</p>
<p>（乙）徵工</p>
<p>河道兩岸，若干里以內，徵用民工若干萬名，工具自備，即以保甲組織，為徵工之組織，從事工役，時間以晨間為限，其工作界限，以居住附近河工完竣爲止，由政府着給津貼，以示體恤。</p>
<p>（丙）災工</p>
<p>國內某區水旱為災，發生　饉，居民乏食者，可募集運往工次，是爲災工，其應用工具，由災工酌量挾帶，政府設法供給食宿，是爲以工代賑，逮其原籍田熟，准其自行辭工回籍收割，不加留難。</p>
<p>古代治河，多爲官員主持，但求平成有功，可以保薦優叙，莫顧民間疾苦，其徵用民伙，視同牛馬，督責嚴厲，惟期早日報竣，民伕飲食，起居，皆非官員之所關懷，馴致因饑寒勞瘁，多罹疾病，寖假死亡，委蛇工次，無人聞問，每讀史至此，輒爲　然，今者國號民國，世趨火同，不得已而興動大工，役使民衆，龜手繭足，櫛風沐雨，無非爲國家利益，則國家對於人伕之健康，應予以適當之保障，如河工醫院等之設立，實屬必要。</p>
<p>治黃工程浩大，所需經費浩繁，慮者或疑國家承大戰之後，無力担負如許鉅款，此種顧慮，顯有不當之處，今爲進一解，以破其疑，黃河自大禹治水後，相安千餘年，至周而有砛礫之次，漢時河次八次，以武帝時瓠子次口，爲患最烈，東漢王景治河，頗得其妙，歷三國兩普隋唐，河患甚鮮，五代河決十數次，北宋次河四十七八次，元次十九次，明次三十六次，淸代河患亦多，竟由封蘭改道，仍入渤海，以上皆爲規模較大之次口，載在史策，其中尙有一年數次者，數年一次者，役民堵塞，少則數萬人，多則數十萬人，有河決一二年始塞者，有河決數年始塞者，最多者，達二十餘年始塞，塞決之外，尙有歲修之役，所謂帑金糜於歲修，民力憚於塞決，曾不能保一年之無事，誠慨乎言之，如將河決時，人民性命財產之損失，塞河時材料工役徵歛之糜費，詳加統計，則知河患損失之如何龐大，所加於人民之痛苦，如何鉅深，且自滿淸末年，政治窳敗，上下欺罔，以河官爲肥缺，以河工爲利藪，於是河防大敝極壞，險工隨處皆是，益不可問，若不及時修治，直是草菅人命，爲患何堪設想，値此全國高唱建設之際，對於黃河尤應澈底修治，一勞永逸。</p>
<p>治黃爲國家百世大計，淮運並治，首尾萬里，亦爲世界有數工程，惟其工程偉大，故施治之先，尤常詳審研究，勘察測量，作按術上之探討，以比較得失優劣，然後製成方案，編妥施工程序，按步就班，循序進展，無見小利，無急近功，不難卒底於成，裕國福民·垂利無窮。茲再附記數點如下：（一）宋元明淸以來，對於黃河，不注重治河，僅斤斤於防河，可名曰河防政策，殊非治河眞諦。本篇所論，旨在澈首澈尾，治理全河，從此一勞永逸，惟個人智力有限，深望社會賢達，羣起硏討·俾治河計劃，健全可用。（二）本篇所論，皆爲原則問題，至於詳細計劃，如黃河入海之口，應用灌河口，抑用舊黃河口，以及淮河某段，應截曲取直等等，須待專家製定。（三）抗戰以來，國軍在各地所掘戰溝，地方軍隊所開交通溝，以及敵僞在鐵路城鎭所掘之阻絕壕，若統計全數，或較黃河改道之工程爲大，又敵軍在各重要據點，所鑿山洞，儲藏軍用品，其工程亦較開鑿鳥鼠山之工程爲大，可見治黃工程，祇要集中力量，必可成功·以上計劃，不可因工程鉅大，而生畏難苟安心理，必須大智大勇，付之實施，須知遲遲不治，黃河決口，國家所受損失，決不小於治河經費也。</p>
<p>此次赴京報到，出席國民大會準備會議，計開大會十二次，業於十三日休會，發表休會辭。在休會期內，一切事務由幹事會負責辦理，俟必要時再開第二次準備會議。質言之，在國民大會開幕以前，此準備會議之機構，不使消滅，「休會」，不過暫時不開大會而已。</p>
<h3>晉京記</h3>
<p>— 朱鳳蔚</p>
<p>此次赴京報到之國大代表，約近五百名，超過民選代表總額之半數。其區域，有海外華僑，西藏，蒙旂，甘肅，陝西，山西，四川，雲南，責州，廣東，廣西，湖南，湖北，河南，福建，山東，西康，江西，靑海，安徽，新疆，江西，浙江，上海市，南京市，及全國性之律師，會計師，醫師，新聞記者，敎育界，的有三十個單位。每一單位推出主席一人，幹事一人至三人。組織主席團幹事會二個機構，幹事會承主席團之命，辦理事務，分總務，文書，財務等七組。而主席團則每於大會開會前一小時開會一次，整理當日議案，推定當日主持會塲之主席七人，再由七人推定一人爲總主席。（採輪流制，周而復始）。此四五百名代表，來自全國各地，千山萬水，跋涉而來。雖國民大會正式開會日期尙留以有待，而準備會議，却足以表現全國人民代表之團結精神，與發揮力量，成績至佳，彌足慶幸。</p>
<p>大會旣已休會，一切都成過去，惟有一事，似尙有追記價値，即訪問是。訪問分兩組：一組爲訪問馬歇爾將軍，推定四人爲朱經農·奚玉書·張靜愚·胡靖安·四代表。大約因蒐集共軍蹂躪山東蘇北證件未齊，致遲未實行。一組則推定林虎·黃志大·蘇邨圃·何冰如·賈鴻珠·及下走六代表，（以下走爲召集人）訪問邵力子·吳鐵城·陳誠·陳立夫·張厲生·（此五人似皆爲政治協商會議政府代表，尙有三人爲孫科·張羣·陳布雷·此時皆不在京。如筆者　　，則在不是陳誠而爲王世杰。）訪問之目　，包括（一）國大召集開會延期原因。（二）無期延展，究竟至何日何時？（三）來京之代表應繼續報到招待。（四）請政府速定期召集開會，以及籲請政府立刻收回東北各省，戡定山東蘇北戰亂，統一全國，還政於民，實旅憲政等諸大問題。因爲時間事務關係，訪五人分三天：第一天是訪內政部長國大代表選舉總事務監督張厲生。國民大會籌備委員會主任委員邵力子第二天訪中央常務委員中央黨部秘賽長吳鐵城。第三天訪中央組織部長大籌委會委負陳立夫，軍政部長陳　·</p>
<p>張部長　詞婉意誠</p>
<p>訪張厲生於內政部，張都長態度語言異常誠懇。說得一口好京片子，刮辣鬆脆·我們六代表，都先後發言。張綜聆六代表之言，而來了一個總答復。他說：</p>
<p>「諸位代表，奉會來京報到，間關跋涉，辛苦已極。到廿五日，忽見政府下令，將開會日期，無期延期，常然氣憤。此舉在政府，當然有不得已之苦衷，但失信於代表，頗難辭咎。故各代表能原諒政府固佳，否則要譴責政府，政府亦將接受而不加聲辯，但請弗譴責其他各黨各派，否則是增加政府困難，而無益於國大本身。國大會期雖無期延期，但以情勢度之，決不甚遠。各位意見，自當轉達政府，政府必當設法解除困難與癥結，使國大早日開會。各省代表旣巳到京，政府總不好意思就請代表回去，總不能隨便停止招待·道一點，諸位可以放心，我是個辦理此事負責人之一，不能不對諸位表示歉意！」</p>
<p>我們覺得張部長詞婉而意誠，聽了他一番答復，不能不在不滿意中表示局部滿意，就辭出內政部，趨瑯琊路去訪問政治協商會議政府代表與共黨周恩來等接觸最多之國大籌委會主委邵力子先生。</p>
<p>邵主委　答非所問</p>
<p>我和邵先生，本屬老友，林隱靑（虎）與邵亦素熟識，但今天係談公事，就大家正經地談吧。我們就將對張厲生所說，特別加强語調，對邵再說一遍，而對政府被少數黨派所要挾，不惜將國大開會無期　展，失信於全國民衆，以及政治協商會議之失敗。政府對共軍之攻佔長春，騷擾蘇北山東，究屬如何處置？是否任其猖獗，容忍到底？一一提出質問。但邵先生答復前半節事講過去，後半節答非所問。他說：「政治協商會議卅八位代表，只有十位，贊成廿五年選出之代表有效，政府煞費苦心，將四百六十位中央委員讓出二百六十名，又增加四百四十名，共計七百名，分配於各黨各派，方得承認舊代表有效。至於國大召開無期延期，實因到四月廿四日，各黨派尙未將代表名單交出，政府才不得已宣吿延期。一面通令全國選舉事務所轉知各代表中止啓程，暫緩報到。現在各代表紛紛來京，開準備會議，實在於法無據，揆之形勢，似非秋後不能開會。政府不能常期招待，應請各代表暫時回去。譬如請客，客到而主人菜餚未齊，聲請展期，又譬如公司召集股東會議，届時股東缺席太多，經理聲明展期，兩者皆爲事理之常，無足怪異。至於政治協商會議，絕對成功，政局前途，絕對樂觀。……」</p>
<p>六代表聆畢，異常憤慨。以邵所言，不像是國民黨中央委員，更不像是國大籌委會主委口吻，將邵之言，逐一駁詰。主要之點，準備會議，乃根據政府定期召集國民大會而產生，在大會之前，準備一切，焉能指爲「於法無據」？然則政治協商會議，豈能目爲於法有據？各省市代表不能任政府召之使來，揮之使去，非俟大會開會，代表決不回去。政治協商會議，國人莫不目爲失敗，而公獨恣言成功，誠別具肺肝。請客股東會議之喻，儗非其倫，即使請客，開會，亦不能隨便失信。共軍到處攻城略地，殘殺民衆，公乃一言不提，誠出料外。雙方反復辯論，卒不得要領，六代表回去報吿大會，無不憤激，乃釀成六日下午邵氏茶會招待全體代表席上之紛起責難局面。</p>
<p>蔣主席　採納羣言</p>
<p>六日上午七時，邵先生來政校宿舍訪下走。下走與邵先生三十年老友，乃告知其全體代表對公印象至劣。下午茶招待席上，發言須考慮謹愼，邵諾之，同訪林代表隱靑（虎）茶叙，林亦以是勸。不料邵在茶會席上，依然顯愎自憲，將答復六代表之言，申述一遍。（當時陳立夫先生與下走坐一　，聆邵言，頓足，頻言糟了糟了，怎麽辦·）致引起全體代表之反感，紛起責難，轟轟烈烈，聲震屋瓦，幾致邵先生不能突國而出·平心而論，邵侮人然後被人侮，蓋自召之也·（七日下午四時，蔣主席茶會招待全體代表於勵志社，主席態度溫和誠篤，未嘗勸代表回去，亦未言準備會議於法無據。並言國大召集期，爲期決不過遠，各代表對國事如有意見，儘可書面提送，予（主席自稱）必在可能範　內，盡量采納接受！可見邵之剛愎，實爲失態。）</p>
<p>陳部長　盡瘁國事</p>
<p>六日下午三時，訪吳秘書長鐵城於中央黨部。吳態度謙和，對各代表陳述，表示接受。其扼要語，爲「和，國大即當開會·不和，國大亦即當開會·故國大開會之期，決不過遠……」六代表認爲滿意而退。</p>
<p>七日上午八時，訪陳組織部長立夫於寓邸，長談二小時·立夫先生彬彬儒雅，抵掌談論時局，洞中肯綮。渠深以六代表所陳爲是，允轉達政府，儘量采納。渠更深以「政治協商會議失敗」爲確論，更懼局勢演變將至不可收拾爲焦慮，而以政府一再容忍爲失策也。</p>
<p>七日下午七時，訪軍政部長陳辭修（誠）將軍於普渡路寓邸，促膝長談兩小時。陳將軍年未五十，而兩鬢已斑，可見其盡瘁國事之賢勞。為言上將月薪十二萬，賴夫人（譚組安先生女公子，名祥，）典質釵珥以助家用，方得苦度。談整軍縮編，正嚴格執行中，即山西閻百川，雲南盧漢兩部，裁縮極多，煞費周章。陳硏究地政，頗有心得。對六代表陳述，全部接受，並嘅嘆共黨之野心，共軍之攻殺騷擾，深懼相忍不能謀國也。（十七日，上海）</p>

<h3>上海少年村</h3>
<p>— 自芳</p>
<p>——流浪兒童的大家庭</p>
<p>八年長期的戰爭，無數安樂甜蜜的家庭是被摧毁了，於是街頭上便增加了許多風餐露宿無家可歸的兒童，除了乞食之外，其中不少是幹着犯罪的勾當。他們不僅有礙市容，妨害社會秩序，抑且是國家的一種很大的損失；因爲世界上沒有不可敎的壞孩子，祗要把這些兒童加以合理的教導，授以生活的技能，是可以變成良好有用的公民的。在美國，這種敎養流浪兒童的事業已有優異的成績，而這種組織就是所謂『少年村』（Boys　Town）。</p>
<p>在美國俄亥俄州的克里芙蘭城就有六處少年村，有八歲至十人歲的公民三千。他們都是被他們的父母所遺棄的，他們的雙親不是已死，便是離婚了，也有許多是因爲父母窮到不能養活自己的孩子。</p>
<p>村中有警察，法庭，利長，報紙，音樂隊，工塲，俱樂部，運動塲，球場，攝影會，都是少年或兒童所充任，組織與管理。村裏的少年和兒童，每天利用空暇的時間，一起工作，一起遊戲，他們練習合作，學習奉公守法·他們在少年村中，得到了新的興趣，有了新的習慣，養成了新的人格，良好的社會適應能力·</p>
<p>在一九三七年克里芙蘭城發生少年犯罪案件二千一百零一起，可是自從有了少年村後，少年犯罪的案件顧均每年減至二百三十五起。</p>
<p>這是一個奇蹟，但這種奇蹟能發生在美國，爲甚麽不能發生在中國，發生在上海呢？因此最近便有惠生慈善社，淨業敎養院發起創設『上海少年村』（Shanghai　Boy　Town），邀請陸梅僧，畢範宇，趙樸初，田耕信爲籌備委員，積極進行，由惠生慈善社撥借大塲社產地百餘畝，作爲村址，並得到蔣夫人宋美齡女士，魏德邁將軍，何德奎副市長等贊助。於上月十六日在靑年會召開董事會，討論並通過了少年村的章程，推選陸梅僧爲董事長，趙樸初爲村長·値得欽佩的是董和甫光生當塲認捐二千萬元作爲少年村的經費，和董士徐國懋先生慨允長期担任敎務長的薪給。</p>
<p>在過去和現在，上海所有的兒童敎養院，祇給予那些收養的流浪及犯罪兒童以普通的陳舊的敎育，這樣的敎育工作是不夠的。少年村特聘請專家組織敎育委員會，硏究敎育工作如何實施，以確定敎育方案·他們的敎育原則是少強制灌輸，多啓發鼓勵，以信任愛護來代替嚴格的督導，以革除流浪和犯罪兒童已有的不良的言行習慣，以及反社會和自卑的心理，而培養互助，合作的精神，使他們成爲自尊，自立，自治的良好公民。</p>
<p>在大塲的寳華寺裏，上海少年村，現在正由二位老師與六個孩子在進行拓荒的工作。相信在不久的將來，這百餘畝荒蕪田，被墾闢成流浪兒童的樂園，建築起一個甜蜜溫暖的大家庭</p>
<p>家庭</p>
<h3>從一件家庭慘劇　說到建立健全家庭生活</h3>
<p>— 復仁</p>
<p>據二十日本埠報載：皖籍少婦程汪氏，年二十九歲，於民國二十六年嫁同鄕人銀行職員程某爲妻，結褵後感情尙洽，育有二子詎好景不常，程因出人歌台舞榭，與交際花朱姓結識，賃屋同居，經髮妻探悉，規勸無效。前日又因此事發生口角，汪一時氣憤，即購得烟泡四只，私自吞服兩只，其餘兩只分令二孩吞服，幼孩已中毒斃命，汪氏尙未脫離險境云云。</p>
<p>從程某所演出的家庭慘劇裏，我們可以想到社會問題和倫理問題。這慘劇造成的主因是由於程某平日行動不檢，所交非人，以至因丈夫外遇而妻尋短見。如果他平時能够想到自己已是有婦之夫，應該以全副精力用在事業上和家庭裏，愛自己的妻子，增進家庭生活的樂趣，那便不會發生這次不幸的事件了。况且程已有兩個孩子，自已也應該想到對於孩子敎養責任的重大，還能够另求新歡嗎？</p>
<p>記得張伯苓博士曾在一次演講中說：「要建立一個幸福的家庭，必須夫妻雙方彼此能調協，能諒解，能忘却彼此的缺點，時時想到對方的長處。」這確是經騐之談，可作現代家庭的良箴。就說程某吧，他最初和他的妻子，感情還不差，相安無事，終於因爲日久對妻子發生厭倦，敵不過社會惡劣環境的誘惑，而走上歧路。喜新厭舊是人之常情，許多做丈夫的起初還能愛他的妻子，到後來往往一變初心，轉去愛其他的女人了。在這個不合理的社會裏，一般男子心目中的女人的好像還是于種供遊樂供消遣的玩物，一個男人儘可愛上幾個女人而不被社會與論所貶斥所制裁，這種「重男輕女」的流毒，常常足以破壞健全家庭的組織。女子爲什麽樂願和有婦之夫結識甚至同居呢？那是因爲一個男人可以愛幾個女人而不被人視爲罪過，同時由於男女知識技能的沒有能達到眞正平等的地位，女人的命運總比較悲慘，結婚或和男十同居有時便是一個女人解決生活問題的唯一出路。一個是以金錢換取「愛情」，（這樣的愛情當然不是眞正的愛情），一個是以色相換取給養。在這種情形下，社會的道德水準被降低了，家庭的幸福被剝奪了。</p>
<p>要彌補這個缺陷，我們一方面要改變人們對於男女兩性不正確不合理的觀念，促成眞正的一夫一妻制的實現。我們不但希望法律上規定一夫一妻制，同時還得在倫理觀念上轉移社會的不良風尙·建立適當的正常的兩性關係。另一方面我們要求建立健全的家庭生活，增進兩性對於家庭生活的適應能力，使夫妻雙万能維持永遠的和諧，延續雙方的愛情生活。要做到這點，必須先在夫妻之間培曰養一種健全的心理，力求生活的適應和改善。上面所說的張伯苓博士的一段話頗値得記取，力其是做丈夫的，要認淸自己對社會對家庭所負的深重的責任，把眼光放得遠些，大些，切莫貪圖一時的歡樂，而貽永久的悔恨！</p>
<p>至於做妻子的，也應以整個的家庭爲重，如果丈夫有外遇，不妨誠懇地給丈夫勸導，並設法使家庭生活增加和諧快樂的氣氛，把丈夫的興趣移到事業上家庭上。理想的妻子一定能使自己的丈夫對於子女發生一種關切，能使丈夫滿足家庭生活的需要·有許多女人，動輒就和丈夫口角爭吵，縱使丈夫做了錯事，你要想以憤怒去勸服他，結果不但無效，而且反足引起反感。我想誠能動人，所謂「精誠所至，金石爲開」，以眞情去化導一個人，不怕不能使他內心感動的。還有，做妻子的又須仔細硏究丈夫爲什麽對自己冷淡，爲什麽不滿意現在的家庭生活，爲什麽要有外遇，把這些父母加以考盧，至少也可以設法予以補救，求彼此間的接近和諒解。</p>
<p>像程汪氏的因一時口角，激於當下的一股憤懣之火而尋短見，甚至要把兩個孩子一齊毒斃了，也未免想不透，這實在不是聰明的辦法，這是「不了了之」的消極行爲，是懦弱之極的表現。自己自盡還要同孩子一起自盡，更有些說不去。大的她的動機是由憤怨而希達藉「同歸於盡」作無聲的反抗，這裏面實在含有一種報服的意思。母親沒有不愛自已的孩子的，然而到了絕望時（其實那能算是絕望）也只有忍痛犧牲不顧一切了。而且在她也許會這樣想：你去和新人歡聚吧，我是不値得你愛憐了，孩子是我生的，我離開你，也伴同他們一同離開你。人在情緒特別騷動和刺激最厲害的時候，感情無法控制情感，便會鑄成大錯。憤恨，嫉妬，失歡，沮喪使一個正當盛年的少婦毀滅了自己，更毀滅了孩子。但是她何嘗想到這是何等的悽慘的事，丈夫固然不好，但孩子也總是無辜的</p>
<p>總之，我們爲了要避免同類慘劇的發生，決不能把這責任委諸法律，我們要造成社會有力的輿論，轉移社會的風氣，從倫理觀念上確立夫妻之間的正確的和諧的關係。同時，我們也可以更相信：建立健全的家庭生活實爲解決一切家庭糾紛和不幸事件發生的最有效的方法。</p>
<h3>唸佛婆</h3>
<p>— 巴玲</p>
<p>『唸佛婆，眞糊塗；葷不吃，只吃素；早點燭；夜做課；用銅錢，不計數；到後來，家產破；丈夫病，拜泥婆；兒子病，吃香灰；夫旣死，子也故；沒法想，去投河；唸佛婆，自討苦。』</p>
<p>這是一首形容婦女們迷信的歌謠，非常確切。在中國的社會裏，爲了婦女敎育的不發達，一般的婦女，－尤其是農村中的婦女，對於生病吃藥，大都不肯信仰醫生，而一味的拜求泥佛，結果不但化費了許多的寃枉錢，還送掉了病人的性命，這眞是異常可憐的一件事。</p>
<p>職業</p>
<h3>蘇州的女轎夫</h3>
<p>— 君宜</p>
<p>凡是到過蘇州鄧尉天平諸山的，都知道那裏有一種男女混雜而抬的山轎，在沿途招攬着上山的遊客。操此業者，均屬附近山下的農戶，在梅開桃落的一個時期田忙尙未開始便利用這個空閒把抬轎作爲春天唯一的副業，藉以貼補一年的家用。其中不乏父媳婆女或夫妻等合抬一轎的。乾坤相配，當地人便把它喚做「八卦轎」了。轎的構造雖祇是在兩根竹桿中間裝上一隻籐椅，但加上乘客的重量，也在一二百斤之間。由於平時這些婦女下田　水，訓練已慣，抬時看來竟毫不費力，就是豐容盛鬋的女子，雙肩往往也能撑上百來斤的擔子，健步如飛，往來於城鄕之間。可見蘇州女人的嬌生慣養，鄉村女子是不在此例了。</p>
<p>筆者上月赴蘇時，曾作天平之遊，據一位女轎夫的報告，抗戰以來當推今年和遊客為最盛，她們所收的代價以里程計算，途中更須收取點心錢，顧均每天約有一萬五六千元的收入。倘使雨水不多，就能扯到兩三萬了。提起她們對於點心錢的索取，跡近詐欺的勒迫行為，如若不肯付給的話，便將你停在半途而不前，致令坐者不得不敷衍若干。有些熟悉情形的遊客，事先將費用言明已一應包括在內，她們就奈何不得了。</p>
<p>在這高唱提倡婦女職業運動聲中，我們對於這般耐勞忍苦向食其力的女轎夫，自然應予敬佩，雖然遊客因其無理索詐而不免引起惡感，然而較之一般不勞而獲的市儈，究竟要高明得多。而且她們根本米受敎育，更應曲予原諒啊！</p>

<h3>台灣的按摩</h3>
<p>— 乃藩</p>
<p>台灣的黃昏，是輕鬆而凉快的。平靜的柏油路，白晝飛揚的黃沙。已經給熱帶的風吹凈了。高大的椰子樹，聳立在夜色裏，像一尊尊巨人。這時，會有一聲聲短笛，輕清的，幽怨的，傳入你的耳際。這聲音此起彼伏，決不是詩人的吟嘯，也不是流浪者的吹奏。他們是一羣職業者，他們的職業是按摩。</p>
<p>正和江南鄉鎭上躑躅街頭的那些算命先生一樣，台灣的按摩者，都是盲人。有男的也有女的，他們憑着一根杖，或是由一個小孩牽引着，像幽魂般徘徊在街頭。</p>
<p>台灣人洗浴都在自己家裏。浴後按摩是一種享受。按麽者的技術異常高明，他像貓顯鷹一樣蹲在你的身旁，憑着兩只熟練的手，細膩的，貼切的，捻徧了你全身的關節。這樣，使你好像做了一次劇烈的運動，又好像睡了一次舒暢的覺。</p>
<p>每次按摩，所費的時間，大概是半小時。隨着物價的上漲，每次的代價，也從十元漲到三十元了。</p>

<h3>National Troops Advance to the Outskirts of Changchun; Communist Troops Retreat Towards Jilin Last Night; Deputy Chief of Staff Bai Departs Shenyang by Plane to Transfer to Beijing</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Beiping, 22nd] Xiong Shihui and Du Yuming jointly hoped that the Chinese Communists would voluntarily withdraw from Changchun and Andong via telegram, but the Central News Agency has yet to broadcast it. It is generally speculated that this is to avoid provoking the Chinese Communists and affecting the Nanjing negotiations. The telegram was sent from Shenyang on the 20th. Xiong and Du's proposed solution to the Northeast problem in the telegram was: "As long as the Communist Party troops abide by the agreements such as cessation of military conflict and troop reorganization, voluntarily withdraw from Andong and Changchun and other places already received by our government, and withdraw from the Zhenkou railway line, prioritize restoring transportation, and allow the three-person group or the Executive Headquarters to be responsible for mediation."</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 22nd] At 12:00 AM on the 22nd, an urgent telegram from Fanjiatun reported that the National troops had approached the outskirts of Changchun. According to reports from the vanguard troops, the entire city of Changchun was dark, with the power supply clearly cut off. At dusk on the 22nd, the Communist troops had already begun to retreat towards Jilin.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 22nd] Deputy Chief Bai recently went to Sipingjie with Commander Du, Deputy Chief Liang, and the Military Affairs Department to inspect. He returned to Shenyang this morning and departed Shenyang by plane this afternoon with Director Li Jiaolong to transfer to Beijing.</p>
<p>[United Press, Beiping, 22nd] Today, authoritative sources here reported that one of the five columns of National troops advancing towards Changchun had outflanked the main Communist forces at Gongzhuling and engaged them in battle.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 22nd] The Ministry of Military Affairs announced that National troops had recovered Gongzhuling between Changchun and Sipingjie yesterday, and recovered Xi'an, 37 miles east of Sipingjie, and Chaoyangpo (transliteration), 7 miles from the city. National troops are currently gathering in Yitong, 26 miles east of Gongzhuling, and are advancing towards Liusangzi (transliteration), the second station town behind Gongzhuling, 50 miles from the final target, Changchun.</p>
<p>[United Press, Shenyang, 22nd] A military dispatch received here last night reported that National troops are advancing towards Changchun in five routes.

<h3>Communist Troops Reinforce Ping-Sui Railway, Threaten to Attack Nankou</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Beiping, 22nd] Official sources report that Communist troops are reinforcing the Huairou-Changping area in the middle of the Ping-Gu and Ping-Sui Railways. Yesterday, five regiments arrived in Ma Ling and Heng Ling, which are under the jurisdiction of Huairou County. The Communist representative in the Military Mediation Department openly stated that the Communist troops were preparing to attack Nankou on the Ping-Sui Railway for some reason. A new regiment of Communist troops has arrived at Qiaozicun, 10 li west of Huairou County seat, preparing for the attack.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Beiping, 22nd] Conflicts near Beiping are gradually escalating. A person from Xixiang today said that there are sporadic conflicts in the Xishan area. However, the 33rd group of the Executive Headquarters, originally intended to be dispatched to mediate the conflicts near Beiping, has not yet departed today due to entanglement in the Jehol mediation dispute, and there is no definite date for departure. This group was expanded from Executive Headquarters personnel responsible for inspecting the periphery of Beiping. The government representative is Lieutenant Colonel Li Jingjun, the Communist representative is Lieutenant Colonel Song Shaode, and the American representative is Colonel Mali. The original inspection route was to go to Anci and Panggezhuang for mediation first, and then transfer to Huailai for inspection. It is now unknown when it will be possible to depart. The military conflict north and south of the ancient capital is currently intense. It is said that 2,000 peasant soldiers were captured after Anci. Official sources claim that the strength of the National troops is sufficient to consolidate the security of Beiping, Tianjin, and Baoding.</p>
<h3>Military Three-Person Group Preparing to Reconvene</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Beiping, 22nd] The Military Mediation Department received a long-distance call from Nanjing yesterday, stating that the Military Three-Person Group is preparing to reconvene.</p>
<h3>Strengthening Mediation Efforts; Agreement Not Yet Signed</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 22nd] It is reported that Special Envoy Marshall, given the frequent difficulties encountered in implementing mediation work, believes that the authority of the Executive Group must be strengthened and its prestige should be increased. He recently consulted with Zheng Jiemin, the government representative who flew in from Beiping, American representative Robertson, and representatives from both the KMT and the CCP at the three-person conference, and obtained five supplementary measures, which have been seen in previous reports. This agreement was originally intended to be issued under Order Hezi No. 7, but it was temporarily shelved because the CCP representative in the Three-Person Committee was unwilling to sign it. It is widely believed that Marshal Marshall's two-hour talk with Zhou Enlai on the 21st was related to this matter.</p>

<h3>City Security Well-Ensured; National Troops in Jinan Await Mediation; Zhou Zhirou Arrived in Jinan Yesterday for Inspection</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Jinan, 22nd] The Communist troops deliberately tore up the ceasefire order and have recently mobilized large armies from various places in an attempt to invade Jinan in four routes. In order to strictly abide by the ceasefire agreement, the National troops have always been patient and await the Executive Group to conduct mediation in order to turn hostility into friendship. However, the authorities have taken thorough measures for the security of Jinan City, ensuring that there will be no danger.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Jinan, 22nd] Director Zhou Zhirou of the Aeronautics Committee arrived in Jinan by air today for inspection.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Jinan, 22nd] More than a thousand Communist troops from Jiyang attacked Shijiawu, 40 li northeast of Jinan and north of the Yellow River, on the 21st. They encountered National troops at 4:00 AM, and the battle was still in progress until late evening.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Jinan, 22nd] According to military sources, approximately 30,000 Communist troops of unknown designation recently landed in Yantai via sea from the Northeast and are currently crossing Pingdu, pressing towards Weixian.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Jinan, 22nd] It is reported that the Communist troops in Shandong Province have ordered the registration of all green crops in various counties, townships, and towns. Once the wheat is ripe and the autumn harvest is over, they will implement a system of grain allocation based on population, with each person receiving one and a half catties of new grain per day, and the remainder will be confiscated for military use.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 22nd] According to a certain government official who told our reporter, Jinan has been surrounded by Communist troops for more than half a year. Recently, the Shandong Communist troops received secret orders from Yan'an to launch a widespread offensive and have been shrinking the encirclement of Jinan on the east, west, and south sides since last week, attacking the provincial capital. Their intention is clearly to support the Communist troops in Changchun, who are on the verge of collapse, in order to save their inevitable defeat. It is remembered that when the Communist responsible person issued intimidating propaganda last week, he said that if the government insisted on recovering Changchun, once the Changchun Communist troops failed, the Communist Party would launch an offensive elsewhere to compensate for the losses of the Northeast Communist troops. This shows that the Communist military conspiracy to expand the civil war has been premeditated for a long time. The current siege of Jinan is also their usual tactic of attacking in the east and west. Judging from the recent provocative actions of the Communist troops on the Jiaoji, Jinpu, Pingsui, BeiNing, and Tongpu railways, as well as in northern Anhui and northern Jiangsu, it can be seen that the Communist Party's goal is not limited to Jinan alone. The government is now deeply aware of the suffering of Special Envoy Marshall in mediating a comprehensive peace and respects the statement made by Marshall the other day calling on both sides to stop the propaganda war. It does not want to comment much on the Communist atrocities, but it fears that it will no longer be able to tolerate the Communist military conspiracy to expand the civil war to various parts of China, regardless of the destruction of national vitality and the sacrifice of the lives and property of the people. The situation is facing a crucial juncture. It is hoped that the Communist Party will pull back from the brink and quickly stop its attempt to besiege Jinan in order to thank the people of the country.</p>
<h3>Situation in Jehol Gradually Stabilizing; Mediation Work Difficult to Start Currently</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Beiping, 22nd] Official sources state that National troops have arrived in Jehol as reinforcements, and the situation is gradually stabilizing. However, the mediation work of the Military Mediation Department is still difficult to start. Official sources claim that the groups dispatched by the Executive Headquarters to Chengde and Chifeng lost their freedom of work and movement before the Communist troops launched their offensive. In order to restore their peace work, the Executive Headquarters sent Colonel Zhu Jiewu (government), Major General Li Jukui (Communist) and an American representative to Chengde on the 19th to negotiate with senior Communist generals. However, after they arrived, the Communist representative Li Jukui refused to meet with the government and American representatives, resulting in the suspension of the negotiation. The Executive Headquarters is very anxious about this.</p>

<h3>Communist Troops Shell Tai'an; Defending Troops Did Not Retaliate; Abiding by Ceasefire Order</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Jinan, 22nd] Communist troops in Tai'an and Yanzhou are moving frequently, and the stationed troops have been repeatedly shot at, suffering casualties. The 123rd Regiment of the 1st Brigade of the 4th Division of the New Fourth Army, led by Liao Zhengguo, with approximately 3,000 troops, fled north from near Yanzhou. More than 2,000 of them forced the people of An station on the 16th and constructed fortifications in an attempt to launch an offensive. Zhang Zhenwu, commander of the Luzhong Military Region of the Communist Army, led more than 7,000 troops and arrived in the area 30 li east and west of Tai'an on May 15. On the evening of the 16th, they fled to the area south of Wand and on the border of Tai'an and Fei counties. On the 15th, the Communist troops also fired two mortar shells at the positions of the defending troops in the west gate of Tai'an. The shells fell in empty areas, and we suffered no casualties.

<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 22nd] The current situation has reached a critical juncture of rapid change. Halting the spread of the war inside the customs, and the cessation of the propaganda war between the KMT and the CCP is about to be put into action. Tonight, Shao Lizi, in his busy schedule, received our reporter with an unusual smile. He said: "First, resolve the Changchun issue, then talk about other issues.

<p>[Our Report] After Mr. Zhang Qun (see picture) came to Shanghai the other day, he invited Shen Junru, Huang Yanpei, Liang Shuming, Zhang Bojun, Zhang Junli and other leaders of the Democratic League staying in Shanghai at 4:00 PM yesterday to Zhang Junli's residence in Fan Garden, Haig Road, for an informal exchange of views.

Mr. Shen said: "The war has reached the current stage, it is no longer the time to talk about a political solution, so it is difficult to decide when to go to Beijing." In addition to the people of the Democratic League, Chen Qifu of the Youth Party and Guo Moruo, who is non-partisan, were also not invited yesterday.</p>
<h3>Changchun Twenty-Nine Days (5)</h3>
<p>— By Our Special Correspondent Shao Shenzhi</p>
<p>Heavy Artillery and Tanks Attack the Bank of China</p>
<p>This is the last battle situation of the Central Bank, which Shenzhi personally experienced.</p>
<p>On the afternoon of the 17th, Zhu Zhou drove Mayor Zhao, Beckett, Ebner, Shixun, Zhuo Zhi and the other five back to their residences. Surprisingly, he drove back to the Central Bank. Shenzhi was waiting for the driver to return. He saw him running into the basement in a sweat, saying that the situation outside was that the car could not go out anyway.</p>
<p>From then on, all external transportation of the Central Bank was completely cut off. Shenzhi liked to wander around. Although bullets were flying, he went to the Central Bank twice a day. He had a special philosophy, thinking that if bullets could find you, they could find you anywhere. Now that he was stuck in the Central Bank and unable to move, Zhu Zhou said to him: "You are destined to live in the Central Bank." He had nothing to say.</p>
<p>We sent out the last English telegram that day. After we arrived in Changchun, we sent telegrams to the Central News Agency and the two newspapers every day. We still don't know if they were completely received.</p>
<p>The ammunition delivered this time was all 79 rifle bullets, which were of the wrong caliber and completely useless. The defending troops were happy for a while in vain, and the situation became urgent due to the loss of the State Council and Mantan. As usual, the Communist troops attacked once at dawn and once in the evening these past two days. On the 16th, a shell landed at the Sanzhongi Yoko Company three meters north of the Central Bank, and more than a dozen shells landed on Datong Square. This was clearly aimed at the Central Bank, but the Central Bank had not been hit by a single one yet. Tonight, shells may start to hit.</p>
<p>The State Council caught fire after being shelled, so the defending troops had to retreat. The defending troops have been in contact for six days since the 12th. The Security Team has never retaken the lost strongholds, and the battle line is shrinking. Yesterday, the northwest corner of the New Imperial Palace and the Imperial Household Ministry were abandoned. At noon today, the State Council was abandoned. During the evening attack by the Communist troops, the Museum, Telegraph Office, Baishan Park, and Datong Park area were also abandoned. The defending troops on the north retreated to Fengle Road, and the defending troops on the south retreated to the Xiehe Guild Hall (formerly the Soviet Army Command), the Municipal Government, and the Police Department.</p>
<p>At this time, many civil servants were discussing the issue of breaking through the siege. They proposed it to Chen Jiazhen, but Chen did not intend to do so.</p>
<p>Although the gunfire was very dense on the morning of the 18th, it was not a fierce battle compared to the previous days. The Central Bank was becoming more and more crowded. The wounded came here for medical treatment, and those who had not eaten for several days hoped to get some food here. However, there was no so-called rear here. Thousands of people were crammed in, and there was artillery fire outside. These problems were not easy to solve.</p>
<p>At noon, the Communist troops adjusted their heavy artillery positions and bombarded the Central Bank, the Municipal Government, and the Dongtuo Building from the east and west. Fires broke out everywhere. The Municipal Government was hit with rocket shells, and it was clear that incendiary bombs were being used. This was the beginning of the general attack. Communist tanks also came out, driving from the direction of the railway station and stopping at the entrance of the Daxing Company. The tanks coming from the south stopped at the entrance of the Xiehe Guild Hall. No one knew that the Communist troops had tanks. It was unimaginable that the Communist troops would use tanks. According to reports, a Japanese tank driver was killed, but we could not see the body at this time.</p>
<p>Although the Central Bank was very strong, it was still shaking. The Communist troops dragged explosive packs to the side of the building and detonated them. One heavy mortar shell fell on the roof. Some shells broke through the glass windows and exploded inside.</p>
<p>At this time, the plane delivering ammunition came and circled above. The Communist fire temporarily weakened and did not fire machine guns at it desperately as it did yesterday. However, after it was identified as a transport plane, the shells continued to be fired. Most of the ammunition delivered that day fell into Datong Park and was all carried away by the Communist troops.</p>
<p>The Municipal Government had already caught fire, and the rear of the Central Bank also caught fire. The battle reached its climax. The battle was in the Datong Square area. The Central Bank fought to the end because it had a generator, so there were still lights and water. Although there were several fires, it was easy to put them out. The fire in the Municipal Government and Dongtuo Building was getting bigger and bigger.</p>
<p>Shenzhi still wanted to climb to the roof to take a look, but he could not do it anyway. The soldiers on the upper floors also crowded into the basement. Shells and bullets were flying around in the building.</p>
<p>At this time, Chen Jiazhen began to discuss how to break through the siege.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, this matter had been proposed on the 17th, and many people had already prepared for it, because it seemed that there was nothing else to do but fight until completely annihilated. In fact, it had reached the point where ammunition was exhausted and assistance was cut off. Documents and codes began to be burned, and the radio station began to be destroyed. Therefore, when the plane came this afternoon, there was no way to contact it. The Central Bank only had a small radio station from the Ministry of Communications to report to Shenyang.</p>
<h3>The Current National Situation Has Reached a Critical Stage; The Government's Policy Remains Unchanged; Hoping the Communist Party Will Leave a Glimmer of Hope for the Nation</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 22nd] This newspaper's reporter has been frequently meeting with people from all walks of life, both Chinese and foreign, in the capital these past few days. The conversations often touch upon the current national situation. The impressions gained can be summarized as follows: The general public's concerns regarding the current national situation revolve around two major issues: politics and economics. These two major issues are, in fact, a single, purely political problem. Overcoming the current economic difficulties hinges not only on economics itself. Factors such as the destruction of transportation infrastructure and the instability of the current situation are all contributing factors, both factual and psychological, to the obstruction of production and the rise in prices. Therefore, since the victory last autumn, the government has repeatedly compromised in an attempt to seek complete accommodation, holding political consultations, reorganizing the government, increasing the number of National Assembly representatives, etc., all in an effort to find a peaceful resolution to the problem. Only in this way can national transportation be restored, local order be stabilized, and the path to economic construction be embarked upon, truly reaping the rewards of the victory in the War of Resistance. Unfortunately, the Communist Party has consistently lacked sincerity, especially regarding the Northeast handover issue, further violating the ceasefire order. Therefore, those third parties, our Allied friends, who previously held high hopes for negotiation, now, while still expressing optimism verbally, have gained a new understanding of the true face of the Communist Party in their hearts. However, the above does not mean that the current political problem has reached a stage where a peaceful resolution is impossible. Some individuals have specifically pointed out that the government's consistent policy remains unchanged to this day. The crux of the problem lies in whether the Communist Party still possesses a national consciousness and is willing to leave a glimmer of hope for the nation and its people. However, this requires concrete action. Currently, what all parties are hoping for from the Communist Party is, first, that the handover of Changchun in the Northeast will not repeat the mistakes of Sipingjie. The key to reopening peace talks lies in this. Second, that military actions will not be expanded to various parts of Guannei, which would only complicate the situation and be of no help in reality, and would certainly not be a way to resolve the problem. As for the government, all parties believe that those in power should be responsible for the nation. This responsibility lies not only in the present but also must take into account the historical criticism of future generations for thousands of years. The indecisive style of decision-making, if continued for a long time, is something the people can no longer endure. This reporter has silently observed that some individuals within the government seem to share this sentiment. The current situation has reached a decisive stage.</p>

<h3>The Resources Committee Establishes a Petroleum Company in Shanghai to Unify the Management of Petroleum Operations; Initial Construction Expected to be Completed Within Three Years</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 22nd] Regarding the Resources Committee's establishment of the China Petroleum Co., Ltd., the person in charge of the Committee recently issued the following statement: Petroleum is of great importance to national defense and people's livelihood. Therefore, the governments of all countries pay close attention to petroleum operations. China's petroleum operations are still in their infancy and urgently need to be strengthened and actively promoted. China's Mining Law officially stipulates that oil mines should be state-owned. The Resources Committee, as its duty lies, established the China Petroleum Co., Ltd. on the 18th of this month to unify the management of the production, refining, transportation, and sales of petroleum operations in China. The Resources Committee's original petroleum organizations, such as the Gansu Oil Mine Bureau, the Sichuan Oil Mine Exploration Office, as well as the Taiwan Oil Mine, the Shanghai Refinery, the Jinzhou and Juexi Refineries, and the oil grain storage and transportation facilities in various places, which were recently taken over in the recovered areas, will all be incorporated into the company. It is expected that initial construction can be completed within three years. In Gansu, production and refining will be given equal importance. In Taiwan, attention will be paid to purchasing foreign crude oil for refining. At the same time, exploration work on oil fields in Gansu, Qinghai, Sichuan, and Taiwan provinces will also be intensified. It is planned to invite a well-known American engineering company to assist in the implementation of the above work. Weng Wenhao will serve as the chairman of the company. Sun Yueqi, Wu Zhaohong, Xu Benchun, and Sun Zheng have been appointed as directors. The company's location will be in Shanghai for the convenience of contact with all parties.</p>
<h3>The Truth About the Communist Party's Destruction of Postal Services; Relevant Authorities of the Ministry of Communications Speak to Reporters</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 22nd] In recent months, there have been repeated reports of the Communist Party dividing postal services, destroying postal services, and issuing stamps in various places. Yesterday, this reporter made a special visit to the relevant authorities of the Ministry of Communications to inquire about the truth. According to their statement: Before the victory of the War of Resistance, the Communist Party had blocked postal routes and interfered with postal services, but the formal division of postal rights and the destruction of the postal system began after the victory. The Communist Party's destruction of the postal system takes the following six forms: (1) Unauthorized establishment of postal organizations, with different names in different places. For example, those in the Hebei-Beiping and Henan postal districts are called "Transportation Bureau," those in the Shandong postal district are called "War Postal Bureau," and those in northern Jiangsu are called "Huaibei Border Area Transportation Bureau," which are "under the jurisdiction of the Commissioner's Office." In addition, there are postal administration bureaus in Zunhua and Hejian, and "transportation stations" in various places in northern Jiangsu. Although the names are different, they all openly operate postal services and deliver mail. (2) Unauthorized issuance of stamps. According to investigations, the Communist Party has issued at least three types of stamps. One is the stamp issued in Yantai with a photograph of Mao Zedong, the second is the "Anti-Currency" stamp issued in the Qidong and Haimen areas of Jiangsu, and the third is the "Mengjiang Stamp" issued in Yixian, Hebei. (3) Taking over existing post offices. As of now, although there is no detailed investigation or statistics on the number of postal offices that have been taken over in the Jiangsu, Hebei, Shandong, Henan, and Beiping postal districts, it is believed that there are at least more than two hundred. Most of the takeovers took place after December 1945. (4) Detaining postal employees. It has been investigated and confirmed that the directors and employees of the bureaus in Chengxian, Qingxian, Gaoyang, Handan, Xiuwu, Yantai, and other places total more than three thousand people. (5) Blocking postal routes. (6) Forcing all postal employees to withdraw within a specified period. Based on the above facts, the article "On the Postal Problem in the Communist Area" written by Mr. Chen Guangzhao and published in the Shanghai Ta Kung Pao on the 7th of this month, which stated that because the postal service withdrew from the Communist area, giving the people and the Communist Party an excuse, the Communist Party's "Transportation Bureau" had to expand its organization and replace it, is contrary to the facts. For example, the takeover of the Yantai Post Office took place on August 26, 1945, and the takeover of the post offices in various counties in eastern Hebei took place in December of this year. Before this, the post offices in these places had not withdrawn. Furthermore, the Communist Party's replacement of postal personnel, blockade of postal routes, and illegal issuance of stamps not only did not provide convenience to the people but also inconvenienced them. As for the attitude towards this matter, in short, there are two points: (1) The postal organization should maintain its consistent unity, and there should be absolutely no destruction or division. The establishment of the postal service aims to serve the people and should not be changed due to changes in the political situation. Therefore, in the past, during many civil wars, there was never any "takeover" of the postal service. Even during the enemy-puppet period, it was able to abide by the international postal conventions and maintain the inherent system of the postal service. Now, the Communist Party's unauthorized establishment of organizations and issuance of stamps not only destroys the postal system but also violates the spirit of the international postal conventions and the postal law. If it is said that the postal offices in the "liberated areas" have not been universally established, and the Communist Party has had to resort to this strategy, then as long as the Communist Party can provide convenience and guarantee, this Ministry is willing to universally establish them according to their needs. (2) The postal personnel system should maintain its independent spirit and should not be destroyed by selecting people for positions. The appointment of postal personnel, "senior personnel are examined by the Examination Yuan, and intermediate personnel are authorized by the Higher Examination Yuan to be handled by the various regional administration bureaus." There is absolutely no such thing as selecting people for positions or seeking advancement by flattery. This has been the most sound personnel system in our country for decades. However, after the Communist Party took over the postal offices in various places, they have been appointing personnel one after another, even promoting mail carriers to directors, which not only destroys the sound personnel system but also will create a trend of seeking advancement by flattery.</p>
<h3>Shen Honglie Returns to Hangzhou; Will Inspect Western Zhejiang Again</h3>
<p>[Our Hangzhou Dispatch, 22nd] Zhejiang Chairman Shen Honglie went to eastern Zhejiang on the 13th to inspect and visited more than ten counties, including Xiao, Zhuji, Yiwu, Jinhua, Lanxi, Longyou, Quzhou, Jiangshan, Changshan, Kaihua, Suian, Chun'an, Jiande, Tonglu, and Fuyang.

<h3>Wu County Police Chief Zhao Weijun Takes Office Yesterday</h3>

<h3>A Separate United Nations Relief Agency is Established; UNRRA Will Announce Its End; Extended to March of Next Spring in China</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 21st] UNRRA Director La Guardia is expected to submit a proposal to the United Nations today to abolish the agency. Officials of the agency said that Truman's food envoy Hoover had suggested establishing a new United Nations agency that includes the powers of UNRRA. La Guardia expressed his agreement. Before delivering a speech at the World Food Conference convened by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, he may announce in that speech his support for transferring the agency's powers to the United Nations. La Guardia has ordered his staff to prepare for the termination plan to be submitted to the agency's board meeting in August. He told his assistants that this work is still needed globally after being transferred to a permanent organization. The agency's legal existence in Europe will end in June, and in China, it can continue until March of next year.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 22nd] George Muller wrote in the "Hong Kong China Mail" that speculation in UNRRA goods in Shanghai "seriously hinders the work of UNRRA and constitutes a threat to the territorial integrity of the Chinese government." He also said: "The unconstrained buying and selling behavior of speculators in various ports of China has forced UNRRA to stop its low-priced sales of relief goods. The Ming government is seeking a plan to save face and take back its distribution rights from Chinese officials. The public funds for flour are almost entirely obtained by employees and relatives of black market merchants, and speculators interfere with UNRRA shipments to various ports along the Yangtze River." Muller also said that before February 1, only 30,000 tons of the 200,000 tons of relief goods were shipped out of Shanghai, but by March 22, the amount shipped out of the 247,000 tons of relief goods had increased to 146,000 tons, mainly because the transportation work was entrusted to the US Navy.</p>

As of now, this issue has not been resolved. Q: Did the Soviet Union request punishment for the killing of 18 Soviet citizens in Changchun? Vice Minister Liu replied: Some time ago, the Soviet ambassador protested to our Ministry of Foreign Affairs, requesting an investigation into this case.

Q: What is the main reason for General He Yingqin's transfer? Minister Peng replied: I would like to ask you to review the report made by General He at his headquarters press conference on May 9 regarding this matter. Q: If Changchun is recovered by the government, does the National Army plan to advance and recover Harbin? Minister Peng replied: It is the responsibility of the National Government to take over the entire Northeast, but if it can be resolved peacefully, the government sincerely wishes for it. Q: Does the Minister believe that if the National Army directly attacks Changchun, it will cause the Communist Army in the Northeast and other parts of North China to retaliate? Minister Peng replied: We hope that the Communist Army will voluntarily withdraw from Changchun. The government has never wanted to use force. Q: Is there any more detailed confirmation about the rumors that Chairman Chiang will visit the United States? Minister Peng replied: Regarding this matter, I have nothing to say except for the speech made by the Chairman himself in Shanghai. Q: Are there any plans to separate the Central News Agency from the government? Minister Peng replied: The Central News Agency is planning to reorganize into an independent organization, and I am willing to fully support this matter. Q: What is your department's reaction to Marshal Marshall's recent statement? Minister Peng replied: We admire the efforts of Marshal Marshall and his staff, and Marshal Marshall will certainly receive our sincere cooperation. Q: For the sake of a peaceful future, if the Communist Party agrees to do the same, is your department willing to issue an order requiring all newspapers in the country to stop reporting rumors and sentiments that may be harmful? Minister Peng replied: This department has encouraged all newspapers in the country to ensure that all editorials and news are accurate and truthful. We will continue to advise all newspapers, including Communist Party publications, not to violate this principle. Q: Does the government still control the buying and selling of newspapers? Minister Peng replied: No, the government does not control this at all.</p>

<p>Liu Adai, a nineteen-year-old girl from Yaogang, about one mile outside the north gate of this city, is reasonably attractive. In October of last year, she became involved with Tianhuo Zhou Changqing. The two were secretly intimate and quite fond of each other.

Zhou, upon learning of this, was resentful and plotted to get rid of his rival. On the night of the 14th of this month, Zhou Changqing returned to the girl's house for a secret rendezvous. Ji Yibin, learning of this, decided to strike first. He gathered Qian Yulin and Zhu Xiaohuaizi and went to catch them in the act. Zhou Changqing was unable to escape and cried for help. Ji Yibin, fearing exposure, was seized by murderous intent. He strangled Zhou with a rope, tied a large stone to his body, and dumped it into the river. Several days later, Zhou's father, not seeing his son return, searched everywhere and learned that Ji and others were suspected. He reported this to the detective team, who arrested Ji for interrogation.

<p>Cocoon Factories Open, Dates Set</p>
<p>The silkworms in Jiaxing's four rural areas have largely passed the dormant stage, and the early ones have reached the stage of spinning silk. However, due to weather conditions, only 20-30% of the silkworms are producing silk. Inspecting mulberry trees in rural areas, the leaves are still on the trees. According to silkworm farmers, this situation is unprecedented in decades. Cocoon merchants, hearing this news, have also tightened their cocoon purchasing plans. Surveys show that out of the originally planned twenty factories to be opened, only about ten have decided to open. Some rural areas are hesitant due to security concerns. Recently, the local silk cocoon industry association has held a meeting of silk cocoon merchants to discuss issues such as security and taxes. These issues have not yet been resolved and will require another meeting to decide. The opening date for cocoon purchase is set for the 25th of this month in Jianan, and the 26th of this month in Jiabei. The cocoon price is temporarily set at 100,000 yuan per market dan, and further negotiations with silk factories are scheduled for the 24th to increase the price as much as possible.</p>

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>Arise, Ye Who Refuse to Be Slaves!</h3>
<p>— Xie Yunyi</p>
<p>"Arise, ye who refuse to be slaves!" This is the tragic song cried out by the late Mr. Nie Er, the Chinese national composer, for the liberation of the Chinese nation at a time when the Chinese nation was facing a life-or-death crisis. When the late Mr. Nie Er composed this song, it was after the "Mukden Incident," when Japan was stepping up its aggression against China; "Ye who refuse to be slaves" are those who refuse to be Japanese slaves! After eight years of arduous struggle, the Chinese nation, inspired by Nie Er's song, rose up and finally overthrew Japan's warlords and their aggression. In the past eight years, Yunnan, Nie Er's hometown, has been our important base of resistance and the lifeline of our nation. Now that the War of Resistance has been won, the Japanese warlords have been defeated; Nie Er, knowing this in the Pacific, would surely be smiling with joy. However, the crises facing the Chinese nation are even more serious than those Nie Er faced in his day; we have defeated Japan, but we are facing an even more serious crisis of national life and death. At that time, it was an overt crisis of national life and death, but now it is seemingly intangible and tangible, or seemingly intangible but tangible, and precisely because of this, it is more "dangerous" and more serious than the "most dangerous time" back then; this national singer, knowing this in the afterlife, would not hesitate to cry out again the magnificent cry of "Arise! Ye who refuse to be slaves!"</p>
<p>What is this more dangerous time? The war against Japan has been won, and the National Government has returned to the capital in triumph; but from the Northeast and Rehe to northern Jiangsu, war is still going on, the transportation on the national railway trunk lines has not yet been restored, and the prices of grain and even general commodities across the country are rising steadily, making people's lives increasingly difficult. How did this situation come about? Any objective observer would unanimously point out that it is due to the disruption and destruction of the Communist Party. In order to take into account the post-war hardship of people's livelihood and the necessity of China's unification, the government has not hesitated to compromise and seek peace, and sincerely negotiated with the CCP and other parties and non-party members, hoping that the negotiations would be fruitful, and China could be at peace, transportation could be restored, and wars could be stopped, in order to devote ourselves to the development of national construction. However, just as the negotiations were about to succeed, dark clouds gathered again, and war broke out again. Not only was transportation not restored, but the destruction of roads became even more intense. The facts before our eyes clearly indicate that all of this is due to the actions of the CCP, and the CCP should bear full responsibility. Some frivolous politicians are calling for both sides to cease fighting, which is tantamount to supporting the destruction of the CCP, assisting the wicked, and abetting evildoers. Some citizens, without making a judgment, are dissatisfied with the government's current policies and are echoing them from afar, and their impact is enough to shake the foundation of the country. If this situation is not corrected, not only will our eight years of hard struggle be in vain, but it will even make our nation slaves; by that time, it will be too late to regret. This is another critical moment for the survival of our nation, and at this time, we must re-propose the call of "Arise, ye who refuse to be slaves!"</p>
<p>Indeed, the government's current policies have things that make us dissatisfied, but we cannot transfer our loyalty to the government because we are not satisfied with the government's policies. Grain prices have risen to nearly 70,000, and people's livelihoods are deteriorating. It is true that this is due to the government's failure to take appropriate measures, but if we investigate the current economic crisis, we can find that the reason why the economic danger has not been reduced or even resolved is partly due to the government's improper measures, but the main reason is the current political environment in the country. The Communist Party destroys transportation, making it impossible for goods to flow smoothly. In the areas controlled by the Communist Party, "anti-currency" is issued, making the currency system even more chaotic, making it even more difficult for the government to consolidate the already inflated currency, and making prices rise step by step. In order to take into account the post-war hardship of people's livelihood, the government is eager to carry out post-war reconstruction, so it has not hesitated to compromise; hoping that the whole country will be united to relieve the people from their suffering. However, this good intention of the government has been sabotaged by the Communist Party, making it impossible for the government to actively launch various measures to promote people's well-being and start anew, and turning the current economic crisis into a serious one. Therefore, the Communist Party should be held responsible for the formation of this situation.</p>
<p>This is a strategy of the Communist Party, to make China uneasy, to deepen China's economic crisis, to expand the destruction of China's transportation system, to make the government more difficult, and then it hopes to get more people to be its slaves and to build its ideal socialist Soviet China. The pursuit of ideals is human nature; it is not uncommon to be dissatisfied with the current policies and be self-intoxicated with unrealized ideals. Using this political and psychological capital, the Communist Party calls for "democracy," calls for "socialist construction," and calls for "New China." The "democracy" under the Soviet system insults Mr. "De," and we do not need to point this out. As for "New China," the "New Republic of China" under the Communist Party's rule will no longer be China, and will turn our entire China into the "Manchukuo" after the "September 18 Incident," becoming someone else's puppet. China will have no national industry, and will join another "co-prosperity sphere" that is in progress. "Agricultural China" and "Industrial ××" will make our national economy have no day of development, and 450 million Chinese free people will be reduced to slaves. What a terrible strategy! Arise, ye who refuse to be slaves! Put our flesh and blood to defend our China!</p>
<p>The April issue of "Harper's" magazine published an article about the Soviet Union, which mentioned how the Soviet Union officially announced the implementation of the Fourth Five-Year Plan on the day Japan surrendered. According to this plan, by 1950, the Soviet Union must produce 35 million to 40 million tons of pure copper per year, actively expand its navy, establish strong naval bases in the Far East, and add merchant ships, etc. The reason why the Soviet Union implemented the Fourth Five-Year Plan, according to the published communique, is: "The Soviet Union must have the ability to supply the countries within the Soviet sphere of influence in Europe and Asia with capital equipment." Soviet political commentators believe that the Soviet Union's security will be threatened if its neighboring countries do not obtain capital goods from the Soviet Union; if the Soviet Union and its neighboring countries want to maintain close political cooperation, they must be based on a solid foundation, that is, close political cooperation must be based on close economic cooperation, and in economic cooperation, the Soviet Union must be the center. From the Baltic Sea to Korea, the Soviet Union must be the center of capital goods in this vast area. Isn't this a "co-prosperity sphere"? Knowing this, we know why the industrial and mining equipment in our Northeast must be moved away. In today's world where the "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere" has been defeated, there are countries attempting to build another new "co-prosperity sphere," and in our country, there are some "progressive elements" calling for "national liberation," attempting to drag us into another "co-prosperity sphere." Are we prepared to be slaves? Arise, ye who refuse to be slaves!</p>

Spain's potential for work warfare is also limited by a shortage of raw materials and industrial equipment, as well as transportation difficulties. In the event of war, it can only rely on its extremely simple and ordinary military equipment.</p>
<p>[French News Agency] New York, 21st - The memorandum submitted by the US government to the United Nations agency, explaining the state of Spain's national defense, said: Most of the defense fortifications built by Spain in the Pyrenees Mountains (bordering France) are improved bunkers. It is doubtful whether the effectiveness of these bunkers can withstand well-equipped troops. Spain has stationed approximately 150,000 troops along the French border, and 325,000 troops in other parts of the mainland and Spanish Morocco. According to the Spanish government, the country's air force has a total of 300 aircraft, of which 65% are fighter jets. The training level of the Spanish army is ranked second. As for the importance of local war materials, in 1943, only 700,000 tons of copper and iron were produced. The Spanish navy includes five cruisers, fourteen destroyers, and a small number of submarines.</p>

<h3>Stalin to Make Historic Decisions on Foreign Policy, Indicating the Extent of Cooperation with Britain and the United States</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 22nd] Washington diplomatic authorities predict today that before the Council of Foreign Ministers reconvenes in Paris on June 15th, Soviet Premier Stalin and Foreign Minister Molotov will make several historic decisions regarding foreign policy. These decisions will influence the trends of the post-war world and determine the extent to which the Soviet Union will cooperate with Britain and the United States to maintain peace. The Kremlin is apparently close to a decision on the following three issues: (1) Do Soviet leaders consider it more important to maintain a long-term occupation of all of Eastern Europe, or will they conclude normal treaties with Eastern European countries to restore them to a peacetime basis? (2) Are they willing to resolve the Trieste dispute by not ceding the entire Trieste area to Yugoslavia? (Some officials believe Trieste has become a symbol of whether the Soviet Union can transport goods to friendly communist governments.) (3) Will Stalin dismiss Molotov's opposition to U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes' proposal for a four-nation treaty to control Germany for 25 years?</p>

<h3>Truman Orders Interior Secretary to Take Over Coal Mines, Immediately Discusses Measures with Union President, Mine Owners Write Letter Pledging Full Cooperation</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 21st] President Truman today ordered Secretary of the Interior Krug to take over 4,000 bituminous coal mines nationwide, with 400,000 miners, all members of the United Mine Workers of America, producing a total of 12 million tons of coal per week. Secretary Krug, upon receiving the order, immediately met with UMWA President John L. Lewis and mine owners' spokesman O'Neill to discuss the government takeover measures and urged miners to continue working under government supervision until the current truce expires at midnight on Saturday. Krug stated that the strike wave had caused "irreparable damage" to the national economy, but he believed that since the miners had agreed to a truce, they all understood that a complete work stoppage would "strike a devastating blow to the United States, from which it may take years to recover." He will ask mine owners to negotiate a plan to ensure that all coal mines continue to operate under government supervision until an agreement is reached that is consistent with the wage and price stabilization policies. At the same time, the coal mine owners have jointly written to the President, guaranteeing full cooperation in continuing coal mining, but hoping to be given the opportunity to express their opinions on the labor contract mediated and signed by the government, and further hoping that the Office of Price Administration will raise the price ceiling for coal to compensate for the increase in miners' wages. The coal mine labor and management sides have been negotiating since March 12th, and a strike was implemented on April 1st, with normal work only resuming during the current truce.</p>

<h3>British Linguist Can Speak Twenty-One Languages, Discusses Beginner's Guide</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 22nd] Linguist T.A. Detho, 64, who can speak twenty-one European languages, has been an interpreter in London courts for 43 years.

It is best to gain some basic knowledge of a language and then devote oneself to reading and applying it at any time."</p>
<h3>U.S. President Renews Call for Soviet Cooperation in Famine Relief, Stalin First Responds to Truman by Telegram, Accepting in Principle But Saying That He Is Unable</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper's Report] San Francisco, 22nd Broadcast: According to the U.S. Department of State, President Truman has for the second time appealed to Stalin to provide some Russian grain to relieve the current world famine. The request was conveyed to the Soviet government by the U.S. Embassy in the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 22nd] Moscow Radio broadcast today that President Truman had previously appealed to Stalin to cooperate in solving the world food shortage. Stalin expressed his regret to the President, saying that if the United States had made this appeal three months earlier, the Soviet Union would have had something to contribute, but now it is powerless. The US made the request to the Soviet Union in mid-May, by which time the Soviet Union had already allocated considerable relief food to France and other countries, and was no longer able to bear the burden. Stalin replied that he did not object to this in principle, but that if the Soviet Union wanted to make a practical contribution, "special consideration" was still required.</p>
<p>China and India's Food Shortages Are the Most Severe</p>

<p>[United Press, Washington, 22nd] Yang Xizhi, the Chinese representative to the Emergency Relief Committee meeting and Shanghai Food Commissioner, told the United Press today that many Chinese people are . . . . The imported food is far from meeting the needs to date. He said: "The Chinese delegation will ask the Emergency Relief Committee meeting for fair and effective food allocation and effective methods to facilitate shipping to needy areas, etc. China needs imports of basic foods such as rice and flour. China's food shortage is the most severe and urgently needs relief."</p>

<h3>U.S. Democratic and Republican Parties' Common Foreign Policy Develops Because of Foreign Ministers' Conference, Vandenberg Reports in Senate</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 21st] Republican Senator Vandenberg, the U.S. representative to the Paris Foreign Ministers' Conference, declared to the Senate today that the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference has developed a "constructive and peace-seeking bipartisan foreign policy" for the United States. He did not explain the various difficulties encountered by the U.S. delegation at the meeting, as had been rumored, saying only that he wished to temporarily limit himself to what Secretary of State Byrnes announced in his broadcast last night. Vandenberg acknowledged that the Foreign Ministers' Conference failed to reach agreement on most major issues, but said that the conference had solidified U.S. policy to draft permanent peace treaties based on justice, not revenge. The United States' new bipartisan foreign policy not only calls for peace treaties with Italy, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Finland, but also wants to conclude a treaty with Austria, whose status is close to the heart of the European continent's problems. Vandenberg also listed other goals of the U.S. bipartisan policy as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Resolve to unify Germany and abolish the current four military occupation zones. (2) Prevent the resurgence of Axis aggression as much as possible. (3) The peace plan must be based on justice and disarmament, not for the purpose of revenge. (4) National borders should be based on race, and no longer trade in the lives or destinies of helpless people. (5) Draft "people's peace treaties," with all United Nations participating in the discussion, not "secret great power cooperation."</p>

<h3>US, Britain, and France Reach Agreement to Divide German Assets in Switzerland</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 22nd] The State Department announced today that the United States, Britain, and France have reached an agreement to share Germany's assets in Switzerland, which amount to tens of millions of dollars.

The Soviet Union has agreed to participate in the division. The real estate owned by Germany in Switzerland can yield about 700,000 yuan after liquidation. It is said that the agreement can effectively prevent any German group from obtaining funds to launch a new war. Switzerland was previously unwilling to hand over these assets, but has now changed its attitude. The main reason is that Switzerland has $1.5 billion in assets frozen by the United States.</p>
<p>Short Comment</p>
<h3>America's Peace Offensive</h3>
<p>After returning from Paris, U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes delivered a broadcast address to the American people the day before yesterday, reporting on the failure of the recent Council of Foreign Ministers meeting. He emphasized the peace offensive adopted by the U.S. government, stating that the United States is determined to strive for political and economic peace in Europe, Asia, and the rest of the world, and must achieve this goal. The specific plan he proposed, in essence, is that if the next Council of Foreign Ministers meeting still fails to reach an agreement on convening a twenty-one-nation peace conference, then the United States will bring the matter to the United Nations General Assembly. Regardless of whether the Soviet Union agrees or not, the peace conference must be convened in the shortest possible time.</p>
<p>We have always admired Secretary of State Byrnes' efforts to promote and lay the foundation for world peace. We also agree with the new plan they have put forward. However, there is still a need for further explanation.</p>
<p>After the war, all countries in the world, especially the United States, hoped that the post-war world would enter a new era of democracy and peace. Through international cooperation, a century-long plan for world peace would be established. Unfortunately, international contradictions cannot be resolved, and each country's "sense of security" is different. Therefore, this hope is difficult to realize. The Five-Power Foreign Ministers' Meeting ended in discord last September, and the Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Meeting failed this May. Even a peace conference cannot be convened. What international cooperation can be discussed? There is even less talk of lasting world peace. This is enough to prove that Byrnes' efforts for peace have failed and have reached a dead end. However, Byrnes is unyielding and still wants to take a peace offensive to achieve his goal. This spirit of fortitude and determination is truly admirable.</p>
<p>We study the international situation and deeply understand where the crux of the situation lies. In short, it is that there is no mutual trust and tolerance between Britain, America, and the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union believes that Britain and America's keeping the atomic bomb secret is a threat to the Soviet Union, so it accuses Britain and America of adopting a policy of power diplomacy. As for Britain and America, they attribute the responsibility for the failure of all post-war international conferences entirely to the Soviet Union's stubborn and unyielding attitude. Therefore, the two sides attack and slander each other endlessly. As a result, the international situation becomes increasingly chaotic.</p>
<p>Therefore, we believe that only if the next Foreign Ministers' meeting can unanimously agree to convene a European peace conference will there be hope of breaking the international deadlock. Otherwise, regardless of whether the Soviet Union participates or not, if Britain and America proceed to convene a peace conference, even if it is successful, it will be of no benefit to the future of world peace. Byrnes' speech the day before yesterday was a warning to all countries in the world. On the one hand, it urged the Soviet Union to realize its mistake and immediately change its attitude, agreeing to the British and American proposal to convene a peace conference this summer at the next Foreign Ministers' meeting. On the other hand, it showed that the United States has great determination for the peace offensive. Even if the Soviet Union does not participate, the United States will convene a peace conference and will not consider any consequences. If so, then the future development of the international situation will add a new factor. It is hoped that the American peace offensive can achieve final victory.</p>

<h3>British Tram Company Resumes Operations Today, Labor Disputes Resolved One by One, Director Wu and Zhu Xuefan Mediate to Reach Agreement, Customs Employees Resumed Work Yesterday</h3>

The Western clothing industry also has news that it will resume operations starting today or tomorrow. These three labor disputes can be said to have come to an end. The details are reported as follows:</p>
<p>British Tram Company</p>
<p>Through the mediation of Wu Wenxian and Zhu Xuefan for several days, the employees resumed work yesterday afternoon and also dispatched several fixed-price trams. However, because the procedures for tickets, uniforms, etc. could not be completed in time, it was only able to officially resume operations today. Wu and Zhu both believe that this labor dispute was caused by the employer's unreasonable increase in the basic salary of employees. Zhu personally went to the Hart Road factory at 2:00 PM yesterday afternoon to persuade and explain to all the employees. The employees requested that the company's move to increase the basic salary of employees be overturned, and that the fair method of seniority-based salary increases be restored, and that it should be implemented from March 1st. Zhu expressed his responsibility to negotiate with the company's authorities and respond within three weeks. In addition, because prices have soared in recent days, employees have requested a loan of 100,000 yuan per person to help with their urgent needs. Wu and Zhu also agreed to take responsibility for this. The employees also stated that in order to comply with government laws and regulations, they would stop the strike and be willing to sincerely negotiate with the employer to resolve the issue.</p>
<p>Jianghai Customs</p>
<p>Customs Director Zhang Fuyun temporarily approved the prepayment of one month's salary to all employees, which coincided with the employees' request for one month's relief fund. Therefore, the labor dispute, which had been deadlocked for many days, took a sharp turn. After hearing the news, all employees convened a meeting and immediately resumed work at 2:00 PM yesterday afternoon, and everything returned to normal. According to Deputy Chief Inspector Ding Guitang, the funds required for the prepayment of one month's salary to all employees of Jianghai Customs are huge. We are currently borrowing from the Central Bank in order to raise the funds. As for the method of adjusting customs officers submitted to the Ministry of Finance a few days ago, approval has not yet been obtained.</p>
<p>Western Clothing Industry: After Zhu Xuefan took the post of mediator, the employees followed Zhu's advice and resumed work first. The labor union notified its members to prepare for the resumption of work. If they can catch up today, they will resume work today; otherwise, it will have to be postponed until tomorrow. At the same time, the Social Affairs Bureau also sent a letter to the employer's trade association, notifying them of the employees' resumption of work. Regarding the thirteen arrested employees, one has not yet been released. Zhu agreed to take responsibility for bail. As for the various conditions and the destruction of store names, Zhu will be responsible for negotiating with the employer to seek a solution. Yesterday, the labor union also hosted the press, reporting on the low wages of employees, so that the outside world could understand the truth. They also stated that they would resume work first and wait for a reasonable solution.</p>
<h3>Clerks and Recorders Who Borrowed a Month's Salary Resumed Work Today</h3>

The presidents of the two courts approved the prepayment of one month's salary to each person, which means that they can receive one and a half months' salary at the end of this month. Therefore, it was decided that all clerks and recorders would resume work starting at 8:00 AM this morning.</p>
<p>Also, during the total leave yesterday, only Clerk Yang Daqi was firmly invited by Judge Liu Yugui to appear in court to handle official business out of consideration for Liu's face.

Currently, except for the ninth and nineteenth districts, which have been fully issued, the eighteenth district was also delivered to the district office yesterday.</p>
<h3>Yuan Ludeng's Retrial Held Again, His Son Submits a Petition Requesting Investigation of "Good Deeds," Court Orders Postponement of Debate After a Brief Interrogation</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The High Court Special Criminal Tribunal originally scheduled the debate for Yuan Ludeng, one of the "Three Elders" of Shanghai, to begin yesterday afternoon. However, Yuan's family informed the defense lawyers Chen Tingrui, Li Baosen, and Chao Jimei in advance that Yuan was ill in prison and unable to stand trial and needed to be postponed for another hearing. Therefore, none of the defendant's defense lawyers were present when the court opened yesterday. When Yuan was escorted to the court by bailiffs, he was wearing a coffee-colored robe, black cloth shoes, gray socks, and black-rimmed glasses on his nose. His hair was already gray, and he looked very old, but his spirit was still good and his attitude was calm. He stated that the puppet rice control association had five Japanese members, including Ueta Kenjiro. His son, Yuan Senqi, submitted a petition requesting an investigation into Yuan's "good deeds" in Shanghai to prove that Yuan's defection did indeed benefit the people. The matters he requested to be investigated were three: (1) The price of rice purchased was indeed higher than before, (2) Efforts were made to maintain the distribution of household rice, and (3) Soup kitchens were established to relieve the poor. After Judge Xiao Xiefen briefly questioned him, he ordered a postponement of the debate.</p>
<p>Shao Hongzhu, 48 years old, worked at the Bank of Communications before the war. After the puppet government reorganized the bank after the occupation, Shao resigned and became unemployed. In January of the 30th year of the Republic (1941), he was introduced by his friend Ren Nidao to the puppet Central Reserve Bank, where he served as the deputy director of the Issuing Bureau. In February of the 32nd year of the Republic (1943), he was promoted to the puppet director, and under the orders of Zhou Fohai and Qian Tian, the "president" of the Central Reserve Bank, he was responsible for the receipt and payment of puppet currency, the allocation of funds, and the custody of reserves. By the time of victory, a total of 388 million yuan of puppet currency had been issued. After being interrogated yesterday, the court ordered that the sentence be pronounced at 2:30 PM on the 28th of this month.</p>
<p>Li Han, from Texas, 33 years old, resided at No. 1, Lane 433, Ladulu Road. He entered the puppet regime in the 31st year of the Republic (1942) and served in the military as a major instructor and special agent. He was also interrogated yesterday, and it was ordered that the sentence be pronounced at 2:00 PM on the 29th.</p>
<p>Gu Jiren, from Shanghai, 44 years old, resided at No. 8, Lane 119, Seymour Road. He ran a grain business before the war. Starting in September of the 32nd year of the Republic (1943), he was introduced by Chen Ziyi to the puppet rice control association and served as the deputy director of the Reserve Office. After one year and seven months, the puppet Reserve Office was merged into the puppet Business Office, and Gu was appointed as the deputy director of the Business Office. According to the High Prosecutor's Office, Gu supplied 2 million shi of military rice to the Deng troops and other enemy troops and 400,000 shi of military rice to puppet troops and police. He was prosecuted and, when the trial opened yesterday, Gu completely denied providing the enemy and puppet troops with rice. According to him, "What I did in the rice control association was to win back rice under the pretense of helping others and distribute it to the common people." He seemed very pleased with himself.</p>
<p>Sun Zuji, from Jiangsu, 47 years old, resided at No. 30, Mingcun, Wangxi Road. He graduated from the Law Department of Soochow University in the 18th year of the Republic (1929) and studied in the Philippines. Before the 20th year of the Republic (1931), he successively served as the section chief of the Jiangsu Civil Affairs Department, the magistrate of Wuxi County, and the counselor of the Hainan Provincial Government and the director of local administrative personnel education. Starting in the 21st year of the Republic (1932), he engaged in lawyer business in Shanghai, but later defected to the enemy, resulting in his arrest. When the court opened yesterday, the defendant hired lawyer Chen Tingrui to appear in court to defend him, claiming that he had not engaged in "work that betrayed this country and benefited the enemy and puppets." He also claimed that during his tenure as the puppet Finance Director of the Huaihai Province, he had exempted land taxes and reduced donations and taxes, and had reduced the increase in land taxes. During his tenure as the mayor of Hangzhou, he had raised winter clothes and set up factories in Guanzhen and at the site of the Sanqiao Bridge. He requested the court to summon witnesses Li Wenjie, Dong Hancha, and Deng Dongming to prove that he had not harmed merchants during his tenure as the puppet Insurance Supervision Bureau Director. The above three cases were all ordered to be retried on a later date.</p>

<h3>Huang Yuan Sentenced to Three Years</h3>
<p>The High Court Special Criminal Tribunal sentenced Huang Yuan, the puppet Ministry of Finance secretary and the puppet Central Trust Company Board of Directors secretary and deputy general manager, to three years of imprisonment for disrupting the market and harming merchants and the people during his tenure in the puppet government. He was also deprived of his civil rights for three years, and all his property was confiscated, except for the necessary living expenses for his family. Liu Xingchen, the puppet Shanghai Municipal Commodity Distribution Director, Zhang Haoran, the puppet Incense and Candle Tax Bureau Director, and Tan Shenjiang, the puppet Executive Yuan secretary, were also debated and concluded regarding being traitors. The sentences will be pronounced at 2:00 PM on May 29th.</p>
<h3>Bizarre Assassination in the Ningbo Road Gauze Association: Deputy Captain of the Defense Corps and Accountant of the Association Found Dead in the Same Room</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The fifth company of the third brigade of the Shanghai Municipal Defense Corps in the central district of Shanghai was located at Room 44 of the Ningbo Road Gauze Association. Tian Weiren, a Zhejiang native who was over forty years old, lived across the street at No. 46. Tian served as the accountant of the Gauze Association, and had two sons. The eldest son, Jianzhong, was an engineer in the Bureau of Public Works and lived elsewhere. The younger son, Jianmao, was still studying and lived with his father. At 8:00 PM the night before last, Jianzhong and his father attended a banquet somewhere and were driven back to their residence by car. Jianzhong then returned home. When Jianmao woke up yesterday morning, he could not find his father and was very surprised. He called his brother to inquire. Jianzhong replied that he had personally escorted his father home the night before and immediately rushed back to his father's residence to investigate. Sure enough, he could not find his father. He then knocked on the door of the Defense Corps office at No. 44 across the street to inquire about his father's whereabouts. However, the door was tightly closed and there was no response after knocking for a long time. He broke down the door and entered.</p>
<p>Suddenly, two corpses</p>
<p>were shockingly presented before his eyes. One was identified as Xu Zhan (25 years old, from Hebei), the deputy captain of the fifth company of the Defense Corps, who had a gunshot wound to the back of his head. The other deceased was Tian Weiren, who had been shot in the right eye. Both fell to the floor, and blood splattered everywhere, a truly tragic sight. Upon receiving the report, the Huangpu Police Bureau, led by Criminal Division Chief Zhou Guanghui and officers Wang Kecheng and Fu Lianfeng, along with Major Staff Officer Chen Mingjian of the Songhu Garrison Headquarters, Li Shiqian of the Second Detective Team, and Wu Mingyong of the Defense Corps, conducted a detailed investigation. They saw a package of legal tender, totaling more than 100,000 yuan, and a watch, still placed on the desk,</p>
<p>Completely intact.</p>
<p>There were also 27 Japanese-made rifles, more than 20 rounds of ammunition, and several pieces of clothing. However, three wooden holster bags and four pistol holsters were left behind. According to Staff Officer Chen, the deceased Xu Zhan had served in the Sanmin Zhuyi Youth League Action Corps during the war, and later joined the puppet army. After the reorganization and downsizing, he served as the camp adjutant of the third battalion of the Garrison Regiment and was assigned to the company as deputy captain, responsible for training work, for almost four months. His death may have been caused by a grudge. As for Tian's tragic death, it was clear that he was attacked by thugs after hearing the sound and investigating, in order to silence him. According to general speculation, this shocking murder case seems to have</p>
<p>Political implications.</p>
<p>After achieving their goals, the murderers remained extremely calm, and except for breaking the light bulbs, they did not touch any of the valuables and collected all the bullet casings, so there were no traces to be found. The District Prosecutor's Office sent personnel to examine the scene yesterday afternoon and ordered the corpses to be claimed by their families. The police authorities have ordered a strict search for the murderer and are determined to bring him to justice.</p>
<h3>Shanghai's Three Women's Organizations Welcome Mayor Wu's Wife: "First, Strong Mothers; Then, Strong Children." Mayor Wu Encourages Women to Focus on Hygiene.</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Shanghai Women's New Life Movement Promotion Association, the Medical and Pharmaceutical Women's Association, and the Women's Department of the Jingwu Athletic Association jointly welcomed Mayor Wu's wife at the Servi Naxi Restaurant on Albert Road yesterday at 3:00 PM. Approximately 70 representatives from each association attended.</p>
<p>The meeting began with a speech by the chairperson, Ms. Qian Jianqiu, who stated: "Mrs. Wu is well-versed in both Eastern and Western knowledge and assists the Mayor in all aspects of his work. Her virtue and achievements are admired by the citizens of Shanghai. In this great era, women bear a great responsibility and cannot be neglected in the future path of national construction. The women of Shanghai have long been eager to contribute to the country, and we are fortunate to have Mrs. Wu come to Shanghai to lead us. We believe that Mrs. Wu will surely provide us with much help and guidance in the future. Although the environment in Shanghai is complex and promoting work is more difficult, Mrs. Wu has extensive experience in leading women's work in Hankou and Chongqing. If she applies her past experiences in Shanghai, it will surely yield great results. I would like to express my gratitude on behalf of the women of Shanghai and extend a warm welcome."</p>
<p>Zhang Xiangwen Ms. Zhang Xiangwen, the director of Renhe Hospital, then reported: "Many schools in Shanghai were destroyed during the occupation, and the number of out-of-school youth has increased dramatically. Although the Women's Movement Association's activities have been suspended, we are still striving to maintain compulsory schools and offer medical and poverty assistance grants. Later, we organized an infant care department to take in abandoned or impoverished infants. However, all of this is limited by finances and cannot be expanded. Now that we have Mrs. Wu to lead us, various tasks can be smoothly advanced."</p>
<p>Liu Jianqiu Ms. Liu Jianqiu, the president of the Medical and Pharmaceutical Women's Association, said: "For decades, Chinese women have been in a passive position, but now they are gradually reforming. Women have the right to vote and be elected. We hope that we will no longer be in a passive position and should assume 50% of the country's responsibility. Under the leadership of Mrs. Wu, we should work even harder to serve. Homemakers have the greatest responsibility for creating healthy minds and strengthening the nation because prevention is always better than cure."</p>
<p>Mrs. Wu Mrs. Wu, the Mayor's wife, immediately gave a reply, expressing her great joy at meeting both old and new friends. She also expressed three points: "(1) Women should pay special attention to medical knowledge, family hygiene, and their own physical health. The past practice of foot-binding was a completely unreasonable system. How can there be a healthy nation without a healthy body? Only strong mothers can have strong children. (3) I am very happy to see so many female doctors and pharmacists today. In addition to their professions, women also have to take care of household affairs. This is something I am very proud of. Women have a dual responsibility, not only to serve in society but also to take on the responsibility of the family. Women must pay attention to hygiene at all times. Summer has arrived. In foreign countries, cholera has become a thing of the past, but it is still prevalent in China. Everyone should take precautions early."</p>
<p>Socializing and Entertainment Should Not Be Considered</p>
<p>(3) Thinking of the Women's Movement Association, there are many women in society who, once married, do not care about anything and indulge in socializing, entertainment, and playing cards all day long, putting national affairs behind them. This should also be reformed. It is most appropriate to start promoting social work from homemakers. I hope that the women of the city can work hard to implement the New Life Movement so that nation-building will surely succeed."</p>
<p>Xu Rui, a member of the Women's Movement Committee, had previously worked with Mrs. Wu in Hankou and Chongqing. She stood up to introduce Mrs. Wu's spirit of service, calling her an "unsung hero" because Mrs. Wu always buried herself in hard work and never engaged in verbal publicity after completing tasks. In Hankou, when enemy planes were bombing Hankou wildly, Mrs. Wu was in charge of childcare, rescuing refugee children brought in from the front lines. She personally met them at the station, placed them in prepared houses, and personally took care of their food, clothing, and shelter, even sewing children's clothes by hand. When the air raid alarm was not lifted, she often went to various places with Mayor Wu to offer condolences. This kind of spirit is what our country needs most."</p>
<p>Subsequently, Dr. Su Zufei, Lu Lihua, Yao Jilang, Zhu Su'e, and others gave speeches, mostly encouraging words, and expressed their willingness to work hard under the guidance of Mrs. Wu.</p>

<h3>Mayor Wu Attends the Housing Allocation Committee for the First Time: Illegal Occupants Must Be Evicted; Eleven Lane Neighborhoods in Hongkou to Be Processed First; Yeguang Company Still Has Not Registered.</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Executive Yuan's Shanghai Agencies Housing Allocation Committee held a routine meeting yesterday morning at 9:00 AM, attended by Director Wu Guozhen and Deputy Director He Deqiu to perform their inauguration ceremony. At the meeting, Director Wu gave a speech, encouraging all colleagues to continue to work hard, increase work efficiency, and cooperate to handle matters reasonably. Because Mr. Wu has been busy with official duties recently, he did not extend the meeting time, so there was no other discussion. At the same time, to facilitate future meetings, starting next week, the routine meeting every Wednesday will be changed to the City Hall Auditorium.</p>
<p>It is reported that the committee will process eleven lane neighborhoods in the Hongkou district inhabited by Japanese residents and other residents in the coming days.

<h3>A Batch of Chinese Laborers Returns to Shanghai Today; Currently, 300,000 Japanese Prisoners of War and Residents Await Repatriation</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Yesterday, Mr. Ling of the port command, told our newspaper's reporter that the repatriation of Japanese prisoners of war has been slightly affected due to the outbreak of cholera. However, he firmly believes that it can be completed by the end of June. Currently, there are approximately 300,000 Japanese prisoners of war and residents awaiting repatriation, including 160,000 in Hankou (10,000 of whom are Japanese residents), 60,000 en route, and 80,000 concentrated in Shanghai. In the future, Japanese residents arriving in Shanghai will be concentrated in Fuxing so that the Japanese puppet houses in the designated Hongkou district can be used by the Housing Allocation Committee. Starting at the end of this month, the number of repatriations per day can be increased to more than 10,000. As for the National Restoration Army, a batch of 2,600 returned to China yesterday, and only a little over 1,000 remain in Shanghai.</p>
<p>It is also reported that a batch of 1,400 Chinese laborers illegally recruited by Japan during the war may arrive in Shanghai this afternoon on the Liberty Ship. The municipal authorities have sent personnel to greet them at that time.</p>
<h3>Lovers' Suicide in Mingde Lane: Gunshots Heard</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Last night at 10:30 PM, a shooting occurred in Mingde Lane on Luoyang Road. Wu Jiechi, around thirty years old, usually dressed in a suit and wore glasses, had fallen deeply in love with Yuan Lixiu, a woman from Wujiang (26 years old), last autumn. Unexpectedly, Yuan had a fiancé, Shen Yuqing (30 years old), who returned to Shanghai from Chongqing a month ago and planned to hold a wedding. Wu, out of hatred, harbored malicious thoughts. He learned that Shen had a relative living at No. 101 Mingde Lane, where Yuan often visited. Wu ambushed himself beside the lane. When he saw Yuan coming out of that house, he drew his gun and shot her, hitting her right eye, penetrating her left neck, and she fell to the ground. At the same time, Wu fired a shot into his own right brain, fatally wounding himself. Afterward, Section Chief Xue Minjie and police officers Gao Xiancai and Feng Bojun from the Lujiawan Precinct went to investigate. Yuan was rushed to the hospital, where her life was said to be in danger. A six-inch handgun was found at the scene, with five bullets inside. Five pawn tickets, a pair of socks, and two letters were found on the deceased's person. One letter was addressed to his rival in love, Shen Yuqing, stating that Lixiu had pledged herself to him as early as last August and was two months pregnant. The other letter was addressed to his elder brother and sister-in-law, saying that he suffered from a chronic blood disease and would not live long.</p>
<h3>Female Employee of the Health Bureau Poisons Herself Before Her Wedding</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Chen Bingyu, also known as Zhenrong, (23 years old, from Songjiang), a female employee of the Second Health Station of the Municipal Health Bureau, lived at No. 13 Caiyang Lane, Dongjiadu, Nanshi. At the age of thirteen, she was betrothed to Lei Jiajun, from the same town, by her parents. The wedding was to be held soon, and the two were deeply in love. Her fiancé currently works at the Engineering Department of the Nanjing Highway Administration and they often corresponded. Last month, her fiancé came to Shanghai to visit and stayed at Chen's house for more than ten days. Unexpectedly, Chen Bingyu suddenly poisoned herself at home at 5:30 PM the day before yesterday and died. According to the investigation results of the police station in charge, the reason for the suicide was that, apart from the fact that the wedding was to be held soon and both she and her fiancé were financially distressed, which led to melancholy and constant pessimism, her mother also had misunderstandings about her daughter. Chen was angered by this dual stimulus and committed suicide.</p>
<h3>Jiang Yiping Expresses His Views on Labor Unrest, Prices, and Other Issues</h3>
<p>Mr. Jiang Yiping, a jurist, recently returned to Shanghai from the rear. Our reporter visited him at his residence and asked for his opinion on general issues in the city. Here is a brief record of Mr. Jiang's remarks: (1) Rising prices are all about supply and demand. If the municipal government can unleash the power of the people, allowing free collection and transportation in various industries, and assist them whenever difficulties are encountered, then goods will flood in and prices will naturally fall. (2) Regarding the issue of labor unrest, both labor and management must work together to increase production in order to seek stability in life. Therefore, factories must understand the hardships of workers, and workers should also understand the difficulties of the factories' overall planning. If they oppose each other, the closure of factories will inevitably lead to unemployment problems, which is detrimental to both labor and management. It is best if the factory authorities can inform the workers of the true situation within the factory in advance and put themselves in the workers' shoes to evoke the workers' sincere sympathy, then labor unrest will definitely not occur. I independently supported two alcohol factories in Sichuan. In the most depressed times, I was still able to cooperate thoroughly with the workers because the workers regarded the factory as their home and the factory owner as the head of the family, so there was no question of labor unrest. (3) Regarding the design of the police control zone, on the police bureau's side, I believe that they have no malicious intent to infringe on the people's freedom. However, the police's duty is to serve the people, and now that the people generally feel uneasy about this system, the police bureau should follow public opinion. If we do not investigate the police bureau's motives and give the police bureau a sharp critique, it will hinder the promotion of the spirit of cooperation between the citizens and the municipal authorities."</p>
<h3>The Famine in Hengyang is Unprecedented; A Fasting Movement for Merchants is Launched; The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Calls on All Industries to Respond</h3>

More than 10 million compatriots have no way to find food, and starvation is rampant, causing a scene of utter horror. The severity and extent of the disaster are shocking to hear. The Hengyang Chamber of Commerce witnessed the scene with heartache, as if sitting on pins and needles. At this critical juncture of the lean season, a fasting movement for merchants has been launched, urging the Shanghai business community to respond quickly in order to save the dying people in the disaster area. After receiving the telegram, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce submitted it to the Standing Committee, which unanimously resolved to respond and urged all industries in the city to implement a fasting movement for merchants. Donations of cash, no matter how much or how little, can be handed over to the chamber for transfer.</p>
<h3>Thoroughly Investigate the Seizure of Civilian Property by the Enemy and Puppets as Soon as Possible</h3>
<p>Inspector Cheng Zhongxing, in view of the fact that although the government has repeatedly stipulated and supplemented methods for the takeover and use of enemy and puppet property, there are still many differences in handling, resulting in the failure to return the part of the property originally owned by civilians that was seized or forcibly used by the enemy and puppets during the occupation, causing the people to feel the most disappointed and painful. He specially telegraphed the Supervisory Yuan, requesting the central competent authorities to strictly order their subordinates to pay attention to rectification and thoroughly investigate as soon as possible.</p>

<h3>Students in the Capital Provisional University Preparatory Class Demand Unconditional Admission; Petition to the Ministry of Education Rejected; Students Stay Overnight at the Ministry Before Dispersing; Professors Advise That Exams Are Still Required</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Special Report from Nanjing] The Capital Provisional University Preparatory Class, which borrows the Jinling University campus for classes, originally agreed to return the campus by the end of April. After Deputy Minister Hang's mediation (Hang is the brother-in-law of Jinling University President Chen Yuguang), the loan was extended to the end of May. Therefore, the class was able to extend its term to the end of May and is scheduled to start exams on the 20th. A portion of the students in the class advocated extending the term by another month and put forward five points: (1) Extend the term to the end of June, (2) The credits earned should be recognized by all the schools to which they are assigned (In the past, some universities, when diagnosing poor grades in new students' previous studies, could order them to retake the credits, but those who passed the exam could be exempted from this problem), (3) Retain the right to assignment for one year (that is, those who are assigned but do not go to the school temporarily can still enter the school within one year), (4) Announce the names of the assigned schools and the number of students from this class that each school will allocate and accept, (5) Those who fail the exam should be assigned unconditionally, not according to the standards set by the Ministry. The most important thing is unconditional assignment. They organized a disciplinary team to prevent students who did not agree from taking the exam and blockaded their dormitories.</p>
<p>Petition to the Ministry of Education</p>
<p>At 9:00 AM on the 20th, more than 400 people gathered to petition the Ministry of Education. Wang Shulin, the director of the class, went to the Ministry of Education with them, but his attempts to stop them were ineffective. Several student representatives requested to meet with Zhou Hongjing, Director of the Higher Education Department. Zhou explained that the staff and students of Jinling University needed the campus to return to Beijing, so it had to be ended in time. The Ministry of Education had promulgated assignment methods, and schools would never admit students regardless of their grades. He explained and reasoned on each of the requests, urging them to uphold righteousness and take the exams in accordance with the law. The students were dissatisfied and gathered in the Ministry of Education's auditorium and the open space in front of the Lotus Pond, declaring that they would not achieve their goals unless their demands were met. They shouted slogans, demanding that Minister Zhu speak, Deputy Minister Zhu speak, and Deputy Minister Hang speak. Because it was raining, the staff of the Ministry of Education went to the scene, seeking righteousness, and advised the students to leave the rain and not seek trouble. The students moved to the auditorium for a while. Student representatives and Director Wang Shulin repeatedly requested the Ministry of Education.</p>
<p>Deputy Minister Hang Speaks</p>
<p>By the time the lights were on in the evening, Deputy Minister Hang spoke to the students, mentioning several points: (1) After repeated requests, Jinling University's campus was only available until the end of May, and Jinling University and Central University will have 6,000 people coming to Beijing. It is inevitable that the preparatory class will end by the end of May. (2) The universities have not yet submitted the forms, so it is impossible to pre-allocate the number of students assigned to each school. (3) The assignment methods for entering school, the assignment of returning students who joined the army as educated youth, and the assignment of outstanding students in the preparatory class all have standards to follow. This is not unique to students in the preparatory class. The methods set by the administration should be followed and cannot be changed. (4) The Ministry of Education should find ways to help students who are trying to make progress but whose families are in bandit areas. (5) I have always paid attention to student welfare, such as initiating the World Student Service Society. I hope that the students will not be swayed by temporary feelings and will follow the law. If anything happens, they can make suggestions in writing and not abandon the crowd to petition. After Deputy Minister Hang finished speaking, it was past 7:00 PM. The students felt that their goals had not been achieved and remained in the ministry, while a small number left without saying goodbye. Most stayed overnight in the ministry's reception rooms and dispersed at 6:00 AM on the 21st.</p>
<p>Professor's Association Advises</p>
<p>The Executive Council of the Professor's Association of the class convened an emergency meeting, stating that it was unreasonable to ask for something without examination (no matter what school, even elementary school students must pass an exam to enter). They urged the students to take the exam before talking about assignment. The students had no objection. On the 21st, Director Wang Shulin issued a notice: "With the approval of the suggestion of the Executive Council of the Professor's Association, the end-of-term exam of this class will be postponed by three days, starting from May 24 (Friday), and will be held according to the original procedure, so that students can review their studies." A joint meeting of all professors was held at 4:00 PM to prepare for the exam. This matter can be said to have come to an end. (Fool)</p>
<h3>Peking Provisional University of Engineering Students Oppose Joint Management and Demand the Restoration of an Independent Engineering College</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Peking] The Fifth Branch of the Peking Provisional University was originally the College of Engineering. All the students of this branch, in order to oppose the joint management by Peking University and Tsinghua University, and to demand the establishment of an independent engineering college, marched in formation at 9:00 a.m. on the 16th of this month with over nine hundred students. They first went to the General Branch of the Provisional University to visit Director Chen Xueping. The student representatives demanded that Director Chen immediately telegraph the Ministry of Education to approve the independence of the College of Engineering and requested a response from the Ministry within three days. Director Chen expressed that he did not have this authority but showed great sympathy for the students' demands and was willing to do his best to advocate for them. Finally, he said that the term "joint management" seemed to imply "merger," and he was willing to represent Peking University in assuring that there was no intention of merger, only to act according to government orders. The group then went to the Military Headquarters, but Director Li was not present, so Secretary-General Xiao Yishan received them, explaining that the Military Headquarters deeply sympathized with the independence of the College of Engineering and showed them a draft of their opinion report to the Chairman. The students expressed general satisfaction and then left to petition the Executive Yuan's office in Peking and the Office of the Censor, both of whom received them and promised to forward the telegram to the Ministry of Education. It was not until 2:00 p.m. that the entire student body returned to the school in formation. Shortly thereafter, the students of the college, in order to oppose joint management and demand the restoration of independence, issued the following declaration:</p>
<p>To Our Fellow Countrymen:</p>
<p>Dear fellow countrymen, our branch has nearly nine hundred students. By numbers, it is the largest engineering college in the country, and its level of education is not shallow. Moreover, the campus is the old site of the former Peking College of Engineering, which certainly has the conditions for an independent engineering college. However, at the beginning of this nation-building, the government intends to have our branch temporarily jointly managed by Tsinghua and Peking Universities, which is alarming. Since Peking University has no experience in running an engineering college and Tsinghua's engineering college can only accommodate four hundred students, they are unable to care for our nine hundred students, so joint management is clearly only a temporary measure. The predecessor of our branch was the Peiping University College of Engineering, founded during the Guangxu reign of the late Qing dynasty. It has a long history and obvious achievements. Since the War of Resistance, although it has suffered all sorts of oppression from the enemy, there have been no major changes in equipment, teachers, and curriculum. For several years, the entire faculty and student body have maintained the school spirit of the old Peiping University College of Engineering without any change. Today, after the victory of the War of Resistance, this school should be restored to continue to cultivate useful talents. Now, being temporarily jointly managed by Tsinghua and Peking Universities cannot continue for long. In other words, it cannot permanently cultivate talents for the benefit of the country and society. The state uses the same campus and equivalent funding, but it does not restore a permanent engineering college; instead, it creates a jointly-managed temporary university, which makes no sense. If our country's industrial education is not rapidly developed, how can underground treasures be mined? How can our beautiful mountains and rivers be utilized? If industry is not prosperous, the foundation of the nation will not be firm. How can we keep pace with the allied nations? The students of our branch, recognizing this, have convened a general meeting and unanimously passed the following resolutions: (A) Resolutely oppose unreasonable measures. (1) We should enjoy the same treatment as other engineering colleges (such as Tsinghua, Jiaotong, Beiyang, and other engineering colleges, all of which will be restored). (2) Of the eight branches of Peking Provisional University, seven already have proper destinations. It is inappropriate for the College of Engineering to be temporarily jointly managed. (3) Joint management of universities is an unprecedented measure in Chinese and foreign history. (B) China needs a large number of industrial talents to build the country. Only an independent engineering college that develops according to needs can meet this requirement, and our branch is qualified to become an independent college. (1) It has a long history, from the late Qing Dynasty to the present. (2) Its graduates are all over the country and have made outstanding contributions to the War of Resistance. (3) Our branch has nine hundred students, the largest of any engineering college in the country, and no university can accommodate it. (4) The existing equipment can be the foundation for developing China's industrial education. The nine hundred students of our branch, with twelve points of enthusiasm, call on our fellow countrymen across the country, hoping to receive strong response and support, to urge the government to accept our reasonable demands as soon as possible. The Student Self-Government Association of the Fifth Branch (College of Engineering) of Peking Provisional University.</p>

<h3>Peking China University to Reopen; Americans Eager to Study in China; Some American Students Have Already Arrived in Peking</h3>
<p>[United Press, Peking, 22nd] "China University" here may reopen on October 1st of this year. This famous university, run by Americans, was closed by the Japanese after the Pearl Harbor incident. The enrollment list now has more than one hundred entering students. Dr. Feng Henry has been here for three weeks and is currently studying various issues related to the rapid reopening of the school. He hopes to complete his investigation by June 1st. Dr. Feng has been teaching at Xiangya Medical College in China for the past three years. He said that there are many Americans who are eager to study in China, and some have already arrived in Peking because they believe that the school has reopened. China University is funded by fifteen different American church units, as well as the China Education Fund's University of California. The number of church units supporting the school has tripled compared to before the war. Plans are now being drawn up to fund American students studying Chinese, so that they can stay in China for further studies.</p>
<h3>Respect Teachers Movement Committee Plans to Solicit Donations from Industrial and Commercial Circles; Yesterday's Tea Party for Middle School Principals</h3>
<p>[Our City News] The Respect Teachers Movement Committee of this city held a tea party at the auditorium of Yucai Middle School yesterday at 4:00 p.m., gathering principals of middle schools from the entire city. More than one hundred units, including school principals, attended. First, Deputy Director Li reported the purpose of the meeting and requested the principals of each school to assist in guiding the student fundraising committee to launch a full-scale fundraising campaign to all factories, merchants, and firms in the city. Subsequently, Deputy Secretaries-General Chen Heqin and Pan Chuantong reported that the original plan was to solicit donations from the guilds, but this was still far from the target. Therefore, students from each school were requested to launch a fundraising campaign to the industrial and commercial circles on Saturday and Sunday. The results should be excellent, but because time is tight, there may not be enough time for preparation, and most major stores are closed on Sundays. Due to these two reasons, it is hoped that the campaign can be extended to Monday and Tuesday (the 27th and 28th), and students who participate will not be marked as absent or truant. The discussion then turned to the distribution method. Principals of various private schools in the city successively expressed their opinions, believing that the city schools have already received 80,000 yuan, while the private schools have not received this amount, so the distribution situation is very complicated. Finally, it was decided that representatives from the city's private school principals, the Respect Teachers Movement Committee, industrial and commercial circles, and students should be sent to discuss the matter together, so that the distribution problem could be resolved satisfactorily. The discussion was very lively, and the meeting adjourned at 6:30 p.m.</p>

<h3>Second Act of the Final Four Basketball Tournament: Lianghua vs. Shantou Tonight; Prelude Interlude: Journalist Team and Tongfa Team Meet</h3>
<p>The Final Four Basketball Championship kicked off the other day. Lianghua made a winning start, defeating the invincible Xinhao team, while the Shantou team unfortunately lost to Xiqing by one point. The second act will begin this afternoon at the City Gymnasium. Tickets are still sold for 2,000 downstairs, 1,000 upstairs, and 10,000 for honorary seats in the arena. Previously issued long-term gift certificates will no longer be used. Military and police must purchase tickets to enter the arena. In addition to the original two programs, a prelude will be added at 6:00 p.m., with a match between the Tongfa team, organized by journalists and famous actors. At that time, in addition to the band from the refugee and orphaned children's shelter still playing music, the Boy Scouts of Gezhi Middle School will maintain the order. The three games are as follows:</p>
<p>Tongfa - Journalists (Friendly Match) 6:00 p.m.</p>
<p>Xinhao - Xiqing (Championship Game) 7:00 p.m.</p>
<p>Lianghua - Shantou (Championship Game) 8:00 p.m.</p>
<p>Famous Actors Take the Stage</p>
<p>The battle between Tongfa and the Journalists will take the stage first. Tongfa is organized by famous actors, such as Lao Sheng (old male roles) Li Zongyi, Wu Sheng (martial male roles) Li Shengbin, and Xiao Sheng (young male roles) Gao Weilian. Not only are they famous on the stage, but they also have great interest in basketball. Li Zongyi and the Lianghua generals are very familiar with each other and used to be on the same team, so his basketball skills are superb. The team recently defeated the Pang team, which shows its abundant fighting power. The journalist team has had good results since its formation, repeatedly defeating strong enemies and shaking the sports world. Players such as Wang Weijun, Zhou Jun, Qian Xucang, Xu Guiqiang, Cao Xizhen, and Jin Jiabiao have also fought in the arena for a long time and have a strong lineup, which should be able to compete with the famous actors.</p>
<p>Championship Competition</p>
<p>The championship game will start at 7:00 p.m., with Xinhao and Xiqing competing. The two teams have different skills. Xinhao's offense is fast and the shooting is prepared, but the defense is more lax. Captain Seymour, short and agile, is the most formidable. After being humiliated by Lianghua the other day, they should try to cheer up and seek revenge. Xiqing is a combined force of Giants and Encas. Giants lost to Xinhao by one point in the Mayor's Cup final, so this is a good opportunity for revenge. I hope the athletes will rise up and fight hard to wash away their previous shame.</p>
<p>Lianghua Enters the Battle</p>
<p>The last game, Lianghua vs. Shantou, will start at 8:00 p.m. In the battle the other night, Lianghua defeated Xinhao, raising their eyebrows and restoring their former fame. Li Zhenzhong's command was decisive, and he is the soul of the three armies. Shen Yu won the point. Liu Fushan and Zhang Shaoqing are good materials from the Southern faction, and their performances are excellent and complement each other. Tonight, they will make their second appearance, and there will be an even more wonderful performance. This time, the Shantou team's generals have returned to reorganize their forces. Relying on their fast blocking tactics, they showed it without reservation in the previous battle against Xiqing, which is a pity. Although the competition will be tough, they will fight hard. The tension of the performance can be predicted.</p>
<p>In addition, the Basketball Committee hopes that enthusiastic people will enthusiastically donate money to increase funding income. The other day, Mr. Cheng Bo'an generously donated one million yuan. In the future, a bronze plaque will be cast in the gymnasium, listing the names of the donors as a permanent memorial. The six teams playing tonight are listed below:</p>
<p>(Journalists) Qu Yaokang (Leader), Zhang Guochun (Captain), Wang Weijun, Qian Xucang, Zhou Jun, Cao Xizhen, Qiu Guoxiang, Jin Jiabiao, Xu Guiqiang, Chen Yinshan, Zhang Zhengwei, Di Xian, Ma Youyu, Li Houcheng.</p>
<p>(Tongfa) Li Zongyi, Li Shengbin, Zhang Shitong, Li Zongcheng, Li Zongqi, Zhang Chuntie, Zhang Xupu, Wu Xianyun, Zhao Zongzheng, Gu Geng, Gao Weilian, Zhou Ji.</p>
<p>(Xinhao) Peigan, Telam, Mann, Angeli, Max, Seymour, Slavaf, Jackson.</p>
<p>(Xiqing) Taoblinji, Funik, N Sasijin, T Sasijin, Steven, Carson, Katie Milov, Chochinson, Qiang Dulai, Botuo.</p>
<p>(Lianghua) Qian Xulun (Coach), Xu Song (Manager), Tang Bao (Captain), Li Zhenzhong, Shen Yugong, Wu Bishun, Zhang Shaoqing, Tao Lin, Wang Xuewu.</p>
<p>(Shantou) Lin Zuozhan (Leader), Ma Xi (Captain), Chen Qingjiang, Lin Cong, He Lide, Ji Nanlian, Zhou Bin, Chen Mingyi, Lin Ziliang, Xu Yougai, Tang Wenjun.</p>

<h3>122 Teams Participate in Small Football League</h3>
<p>The Small Football Committee of the City Sports Association held its third meeting at the Liao Association Hall yesterday at 5:00 p.m. The attendees were Pei Shunyuan, Qian Xucang, Qian Weilie, Wu Zibin, Shen Huichun, Xi Zheng, Chen Zhong, Zhang Baokui, etc. Shao Rugan, the general secretary of the Sports Association, was present for guidance. First, the chairman reported that a total of 122 teams are participating in the league: 14 in Group A, 24 in Group B, and 84 in Group C. Subsequently, the following cases were resolved:</p>
<p>(1) The committee's funds are insufficient, and it was decided to request the City Sports Association to increase funding, and the committee will prepare a budget table for review. (2) It was decided that Group A would be divided into two sections, each with seven teams, Group B would be divided into four sections, and Group C would be divided into fourteen sections, each with six teams. (3) Due to Shen Huichun's illness, the chairman will temporarily take over the duties of the secretary, and Gong Shunbao will be added as a secretary of the committee. (4) It was decided to invite Mayor Wu to kick off the inaugural league organized by the committee.</p>
<p>In addition, the league venues will be divided into four districts: Hunan, Husi, Huzhong, and Northeast. Participating teams can choose a convenient venue and are hoped to go to the committee's designated location in Jing'an Building within three days.</p>
<h3>First Volleyball League: Registration on June 1st</h3>
<p>The Volleyball Committee of the City Sports Association held its second meeting at the City Gymnasium yesterday (the 21st) at 5:00 p.m. The attendees were Yu Yunjun, Xie Yiqin, Zhang Biru, Liu Hesheng, and six other committee members. Shao Rugan was present for guidance. Chairman Zhang Baokui and recorder Yin immediately passed the rules for the first Shanghai Volleyball League. It was decided to divide it into four groups: men's A, men's B, women's A, and ordinary women's schools. All adopt a single round-robin system. Men's A is best of five sets, men's B and women's groups are best of three sets. Registration is scheduled from June 1st to the 11th, and each team will be charged a registration fee of 3,000 yuan and a deposit of 5,000 yuan. The meeting adjourned after the discussion.</p>
<h3>Professor Jiang Xiangqing Discusses: Shanghai as China's Sports Capital; The Dynamics and Development of Sports Must Emphasize Psychological Construction; Learning from the West Requires Mastering Practical Application, Not Merely Enjoying its Benefits</h3>
<p>Professor Jiang Xiangqing, the founder of sports in this city, has returned to Shanghai on leave from [Chengdu] after a nine-year absence. Director Gu, upon learning of this, immediately offered him the position of director of the Municipal Sports Field, urging him to stay and serve in Shanghai. He is currently taking the exam [for this position]. After presiding over Wuhan University for five years during the war, he went to the National Guizhou Normal College to establish a sports department, cultivating teachers for the rear area and developing sports in the Southwest, making significant contributions. He is the author of "Sports and Life," a book of two hundred thousand words, which, in addition to receiving a special publication grant from the Academic Review Committee of the Ministry of Education, was also officially approved by the Ministry as proof of his professorial qualification. This makes him the first person in the Chinese sports world without foreign study experience to obtain a professor's certificate. In recent years, he has continued his research, supplementing and revising his work, hoping to publish it after the political situation stabilizes. The Board of Directors of the China Education and Culture Foundation has granted him a special research grant to fulfill his ambition. His appointment as a member of the qualification review committee for the promotion of teachers in independent colleges, achieving a lofty academic status, is also due to this. It is truly an encouragement to his peers that a sports professor has received this honor. According to him, Shanghai is not only China's economic capital but also its sports capital. In industrial cities, the value of recreational education naturally surpasses all else, but in addition to entertainment, one must not forget its greater significance—reforming the next generation to bear the heavy burden of modern citizenship. Therefore, its development must not be detached from or run counter to education. Since the whole country looks to Shanghai as a leader, it must set a good example for others to emulate, so as not to be criticized by discerning people. A nation of third-rate physiques cannot build a first-rate country. The title of one of the "Big Four" cannot be made to match reality through mere lip service. Therefore, cultivating people is even more important than creating wealth. How to cultivate people? There are only two ways: (1) One must recognize sports as a form of labor. What distinguishes it from general labor is merely that it is dressed in a happy garment and can only produce indirectly rather than directly. So-called indirect production means that after learning sports, one must improve one's work efficiency, produce invisibly, and reap tangible rewards. If one is a student, then one must be able to enhance one's academic performance and moral character. In short, there should be a bridge between the sports field and the workplace. If this bridge is cut off, then sports is a waste, and sports people are consumers rather than producers, which, in terms of social problems, is a crime. It is like having a sick person in a family, who not only reduces the number of producers but also requires some healthy people to provide medicine, sharing in the consumption of manpower and resources. Wasteful sports is not what China, which is currently in extreme economic poverty, needs. We learn from the West to innovate, but we must learn how to "apply" it, not merely how to "enjoy" it. At least until China embarks on the road to modernity, this proposition must be emphasized, because we do not yet have the qualifications to enjoy sports. (2) Mere physical health does not benefit the nation. Only when the mind is equally healthy can one contribute to both the individual and the greater good. Physical ill-health is a crime, but mental ill-health is an even greater crime. This is why Dr. Sun Yat-sen's emphasis on psychological construction is something that our sports community and sports enthusiasts must strive for. Therefore, the title of sports capital carries a heavy responsibility and a long journey, a high reputation and a distant abode, which is truly thought-provoking.</p>

<h3>Answering Readers' Legal Questions</h3>
<p>(1) Cui Lin asks: During the war, my father was forced by the enemy and puppet forces to sell his house at a low price. I have recently returned from the rear, but I do not know what legal basis I should use [to reclaim it]. Please advise.</p>
<p>[Lawyer Duanmu Kai replies:] If you have concrete proof that you were forced by the enemy and puppet forces, you can submit it to the Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau for review.</p>
<p>(2) Xia Ru asks: (1) Does Article 12 of the Supplementary Measures for Civil Litigation, regarding remedial measures, refer to "leases and loans that have undergone drastic changes in circumstances, and whose effectiveness under the original relationship is obviously unfair," or does it refer to "private debts and the redemption and return of all real estate sales, mortgages, and leases"? Or does it refer to both? Please explain in detail. (2) During the enemy and puppet era, what method should be used to redeem a mortgage contract established using puppet currency, now calculated in legal tender? (3) If a mortgage contract was established using puppet currency, and the other party still refuses to allow redemption even when legal tender is used to redeem it at the appropriate rate, what should be done? (4) Please explain the text of Article 12 of the Supplementary Measures.</p>
<p>[Lawyer Duanmu Kai replies:] (1) (4) According to the Interpretation of Article 12 of the Supplementary Regulations for Handling Civil Litigation After Recovery, legal acts are not limited to leases and loans, but include all legal acts. (2) (3) Puppet Central Reserve Notes should be converted to legal tender at a rate of two hundred to one. If the other party disputes this, you can seek a court decision to resolve it.</p>
<p>(3) Chen Kechang asks: I previously rented a shop from Mr. B, who is a sub-landlord. It was agreed that the stove room would be shared by seven tenants. The stove room was originally built with lead sheeting, which has not been repaired for eight years and is in disrepair. I asked Mr. A and Mr. B to repair it, but Mr. B replied that he could not afford to repair it, and Mr. A said that he would demolish all the lead sheeting and floorboards, estimating that it would cost 500,000 yuan, which he proposed to be shared by all the tenants, but this was rejected. I ask: (1) If I repair it at my own expense, and Mr. A insists on demolishing it and preventing me from doing so, what should be done? (2) If the repair cost is very high, and I repair it at my own expense, but it is still for public use, can I ask for the stove room to be transferred to me for residence? Does Mr. A have the right to prevent this?</p>
<p>[Lawyer Duanmu Kai replies:] (1) If the stove room is necessary for use, you can only ask Mr. B to repair it. (2) If Mr. B has been using the stove room, then there is no problem since Mr. B has agreed.</p>
<h3>Enthusiastic Disaster Relief by Employees of China Textile Mill No. 17; Earnestly Requesting Donations from All Sectors</h3>
<p>To the Editor: From the newspapers, the famine in Hunan and Guangxi is becoming increasingly serious. Eating clay, gnawing on tree bark, and cannibalism—all kinds of horrific scenes are being enacted day by day and spreading day by day. Faced with this situation, all of us compatriots, reading about it, should ask ourselves, can we remain unmoved? We are a group of workers in the textile mill, working day and night, heads down, toiling diligently. News of the famine in Hunan and Guangxi has reached everyone's ears, and the most fervent cries are coming from the depths of everyone's hearts! We need to provide relief for the famine in Hunan and Guangxi; we cannot be numb. Although the literate among us are a definite minority, compassion is something everyone possesses. We need to provide relief for the famine in Hunan and Guangxi—regarding others' drowning as our own, regarding others' hunger as our own. Moreover, since we are all descendants of the Yellow Emperor, how can we stand idly by and not care? Those with money should contribute money, those with strength should contribute strength. Disaster relief is like putting out a fire; we hope that all people of goodwill will rise up together to help, so that the disaster-stricken people of Hunan and Guangxi can be spared from death. It's not only the disaster-stricken people who will be saved, but the safety of society is also at stake. We have collected 1,460,650 yuan in legal tender and hope that your esteemed newspaper will forward it to the relevant authorities and publish it. We are extremely eager to see this happen. We hereby wish you good health. Respectfully, All Employees of China Textile Mill No. 17.</p>
<h3>Wounded Soldier Pleading for Relief</h3>
<p>To the Editor: I am a wounded sergeant from Huarong County, Hunan Province. In the 31st year of the Republic [1942], I went on an expedition to India and Burma and was wounded in the war. This February, I returned to the country with honor and reported to the Army Headquarters. I then returned to Huarong to recuperate, only to find that my old home had been destroyed by enemy aircraft, and my family members had all died. I have no relatives or friends, and I am destitute. I did not hesitate to travel to Shanghai, hoping that the military and political authorities in Shanghai would provide relief. I have described my plight in detail to the municipal government, the garrison headquarters, the social bureau, and other agencies, requesting relief and placement, but all of them said that they had no authority to handle it. I have no relatives or friends here, and I have been in Shanghai for many days, and I am about to become a vagrant. I have no choice but to implore your esteemed newspaper to show sympathy and publish my situation in the newspaper to appeal to all sectors of society. I also earnestly hope that the compatriots in Shanghai will act with love and sincerity to provide relief to prevent me from becoming a vagrant. I would be eternally grateful. Hereby wishing you good health. Respectfully, Tang Xiangqing</p>

<h3>Allocation Price Rises with Black Market; Gold Market Atmosphere Cheerful; Continues to Rise by 40,000 Compared to Previous Closing</h3>
<p>Following yesterday's continued prosperity, the Central Bank allocated 221 bars to colleagues, and the price rose to 1.91 million. People's apprehensions have been swept away, and the market price has continued to rise steadily. The morning opened flat, and after opening, many floating positions were closed, causing a slight dip to 1.89 million. However, after the floating chips from overnight were cleared, the market hovered around 1.91 million after 10:00 AM. The Central Bank allocated to colleagues at a price of 1.91 million. Generally, people believe that the allocation price is always comparable to the black market. Based on past examples of forward foreign exchange and cloth allocations, the future of the Central Bank's control of gold prices is not underestimated. Everyone believes that the floor price may rise further. The psychology of retail investors is fluctuating. After the allocation was completed, the market gradually improved, rising to around 1.96 million at noon before stabilizing slightly. In the afternoon, same-day delivery still stood at around 1.95 million, up 40,000 from the previous close. After 2:00 PM, partly influenced by the atmosphere of peace, next-day delivery saw small sales down to 1.93 million. Gold jewelry hung at 10,060, silver ingots at 1,800, silver dollars were stable, and the covert discount gradually decreased from 17 fen to 14 fen.</p>
<h3>US Dollar Slightly Rises</h3>
<p>Hedging Expanded to Over 800</p>
<p>Foreign currency US dollars remained passive. The morning opened at 2405 yuan with selling, and after opening, the low price was seen at 2390 yuan. After entering, it rose with the gold price to above 2430 yuan. At noon, it was slightly flat, and in the afternoon, it was still fluctuating between 2420 yuan and 2440 yuan. As a result, it rose slightly by 10 yuan compared to the previous close, and hedging expanded to over 800 yuan. Hong Kong dollars were stable and unremarkable. The result was similar to the previous day, and Hong Kong exchange rates and Robi were flat, as were US exchange rates.</p>
<h3>Government Bonds Stable; Buyers Seek Out Miscellaneous Brands</h3>
<p>The situation of government bonds is stable, and buyers continue to seek out miscellaneous brands. The popular Unified Bing could only temporarily linger around the previous closing price, waiting for an opportunity to move. The high price was 6780 yuan, and the low price was 6480 yuan. As a result, it rose slightly by 50 yuan compared to the previous close. Jia, Yi, and Wu each rose by 100 yuan, and Ding rose by 150.</p>
<h3>Silk Slightly Improving; Rayon Still Weak</h3>
<p>Rayon has been hovering around 1.4 million yuan for several consecutive days. Yesterday, the market for Great Bridge 120 had light activity, and the opening showed fatigue, with asking prices at 1.35 million yuan. The closing price still maintained the original opening price, 20,000 yuan lower than the previous day's closing price. Someone asked for 370,000 yuan to sell, but there were no takers. In the afternoon, the price suddenly rose to 1.4 million yuan. The miscellaneous brand Blackbird asked for 40,000 yuan more than yesterday, and the rest were similar to the previous day, but there were no transactions. In general, affected by the China Textile sale, people's hearts are weak, and it is difficult to raise prices. Raw silk foreign firms had slight transactions. The price of high uniformity 81 points was 2.37 million yuan. The price of user silk in each grade increased by about 50,000 yuan. Qianjing also improved. Silk goods were also slightly better yesterday. Mei Ya bed sheets were 1.18 million yuan per hundred, and Da Cheng checkered crepe was 4,100 yuan per yard.</p>
<h3>Sugar Price Slightly Declines</h3>
<p>Longan and Dried Lily Flowers Both Scarce</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market trend was slightly flat. The association's price for medium sand white first-grade was 76,500 yuan to 77,000 yuan, then slightly down to 73,000 to 74,000 yuan. In the afternoon, it returned to 75,000 yuan, and then called 76,000 yuan. Raw sand was 64,500 yuan. Gao Diaoqing opened at 52,000 to 53,000 yuan. The lower grade identity was softer and the color was worse, returning 42,000 yuan, not opened. Miscellaneous red was 56,000 to 57,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Dried lily flowers are trending firmly due to shortage. Yesterday, the market price at the Te Gao Xiangzhuang vegetable shop was 160,000 to 170,000 yuan, ordinary 140,000 to 150,000 yuan, and the next best 120,000 to 130,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Recently, longan has been short of stock, especially Xinghua longan, which is even rarer, leading to repeated price increases. Several dozen loads of miscellaneous large goods were opened, rising another 10,000 yuan compared to the previous day, so the market price also followed step by step, climbing up the ladder.</p>
<h3>Customs Labor Dispute Resolved; Ships Enter and Exit One After Another</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The customs strike was resolved yesterday afternoon. At 2:00 PM, all resumed work, and all shipping companies resumed normal operations, handling customs declarations according to the original procedures. The American President Lines has about twenty ships in port, with a total of about 150,000 tons of cargo. The British Company's Sam Zhi Ya entered the port yesterday morning, berthed at the Gong He Xiang Wharf to unload cotton, and then sailed to the Qujiang Wharf to unload railway materials. The Fulai Company has three ships in Shanghai, one of which brought about 14,000 feet of timber. The Norwegian merchant Hua Lun Foreign Company has two ships in the port, and one ship, Yi Pai Wei Er, is outside the Wusong estuary and will also enter the port within days. The Blue Funnel Line's Atlas arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon, and at the end of the month, there will be 300 tons of tung oil transported to the United States in bulk cargo. In addition, the China Merchants Bureau's Hai Gui ship will sail to Guangdong today, loaded with 1,500 bales of cotton yarn and 1,000 bales of cotton, and the rest of the cargo is full of medicinal materials and other miscellaneous goods.</p>
<h3>Fifteen Minutes of Market Activity; Few Yarn Transactions</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn industry market was virtually suspended because the 5th Company of the 2nd Brigade of the Central District Regiment of the Shanghai Municipal Defense General Corps was stationed on the fourth floor of Tonghe Guli Yarn and the association. The night before, it was suddenly visited by rioters who attempted to seize the team's firearms, and the association clerk Mr. Tian and the team's instructor, who were staying on the fourth floor, were killed, and several handguns were snatched away (details can be found in the local news section). As a result, the front and back doors of the association were closed yesterday morning, and colleagues had no way to gather. Although it was opened for fifteen minutes at 10:15 AM, the association announced at 11:00 AM that the market would close early, so there were very few transactions. In the alleyway trading, Da Sheng Factory sold more than 100 pieces of 20-count Cai Kuixing yarn, priced at 1.11 million. The supply of other 20-count spot goods was not much. Zhejiang, Fujian, and Beijing-Wuhu merchants slightly reduced their inventory, and prices rose by about 10,000 to 20,000 compared to the previous day, with a very firm foothold. At noon, Fangjian opened yarn as usual. Among them, 10-count double-strand and 20-count coarse yarn rose by 50,000 to 70,000 compared to the previous period, while 32-count and 42-count thread decreased by 20,000 to 100,000. It was also heard that another set of 12 kinds of fine yarn and thread were sold by bidding. The development of spring silkworms in Xiangchun is early. The early batch has already spun cocoons, the large batch is shedding leaves after the big sleep, and the late batch is in the third sleep stage. The early batch of spring silkworms in Houzhai, Shengli Fang, Qiaodong, and other places have all had their big sleep, and the silkworms are healthy. However, the price of mulberry leaves has soared. The price was previously 6,000 yuan per load, but now it has risen to 11,000 yuan due to the influence of rice prices.</p>
<h3>Situation Gradually Improving; Stock Market Sentiment More Stable</h3>
<p>Chinese stocks began to compete between bulls and bears. Small stocks, due to the overall situation improving, attracted some speculative funds, and retail investors' panic gradually stabilized. The process was much better than that of large stocks. Yongsha opened at 5230 yuan, Meiya at 4200 yuan, and closed at lower prices. Jingfu's midpoint was at the highest 365 yuan, Xinguang at 300 yuan, and Qinxing at 265 yuan. At noon, it was influenced by the fatigue of large stocks and was also brought down. As a result, large stocks Yongsha and Meiya only rose slightly compared to the previous close, while small stocks continued to rise by half a percentage. The rest were slightly better. Foreign stocks had balanced supply and demand. A certain trust company cut more, and the securities firms filled the short positions. The process was in a stable state, with slight gains. As a result, except for Jardine Matheson, which was flat, large stocks rose very little, while small stocks rose by half a percentage.</p>
<h3>Bituminous Coal Rises; White Coal Falls; Fuel Management Committee Continues to Allocate</h3>
<p>The sales of bituminous coal lumps are slightly more active, and sellers want to raise prices slightly, and the market price has risen slightly by 10,000 yuan. The arrival of white coal lumps in the north continues smoothly, but sales are still limited to lower-grade goods such as small coal, and the market price is hovering in a soft range. There are two main reasons for the current sluggish sales of white coal: (1) because the season for coal stoves has passed, and (2) most restaurants previously used mud coal as a substitute due to the interruption of the source of white coal lumps and the high price. Now, if they reuse white coal lumps, their bellows and stoves will have to be completely refitted to be suitable, and the refitting cost is huge, so the sales of white coal lumps to the restaurant industry are difficult to promote for a while.</p>
<p>[Another Report] In order to completely stabilize fuel, the Fuel Management Committee continues to purchase on a large scale from various places. On the one hand, it still allocates coal to the actual users of various industries according to their actual needs. According to the daily spot needs of each coal merchant in the city, the committee assigns the Minsheng Coal Management Office to be responsible, and the allocation price is 160,000 yuan per ton of No. 1 bituminous coal dust and 140,000 yuan per ton of No. 2 bituminous coal dust. As for trains, ships, and industrial factories, the management committee directly assigns them: (1) Trains: 70,000 yuan per ton, (2) Ships: 70,000 yuan per ton, (3) Industrial factories: 135,000 yuan per ton. It is heard that the merchants are afraid that it will be difficult to sell in the future due to the high allocation price.</p>
<h3>Active Spot Cotton Trading</h3>
<p>The New York American cotton market reported a decline of six to eight pound coins, calculated as 27.38 for near-term US dollars, 27.91 for long-term, and 27.97 for Mitchell's spot goods. The local spot cotton trading is lively. The Fangjian Company smoothly handled Mitchell's price from 94,000 to 97,000, and Qielila's second-grade was 70,000 yuan, for a total of 2,670 bales. China New No. 7 Factory imported 103,000 yuan of super Mitchell.</p>
<h3>Indian Merchants Purchasing Extracted Tribute</h3>
<p>In the foreign tea market, recently, only Indian merchants are still trading for high-quality special extracted tribute tea. Unfortunately, this variety was mostly converted by tea factories in the city into domestic tea during the war due to transportation issues. Although the new goods have been on the market for a long time, they have not been made yet, so there are still a few stocks of old goods in the market, and holders believe that they are rare goods to be sold. As a result, the trend tends to be good. Yesterday, about 100 loads were dragged in by Qianyi Foreign Company, and the price was 38,000 yuan per load, which was more than 1,000 yuan higher than the previous day. Other firms such as Ruichang Nianmazhi are still negotiating with the cargo side. Looking at the current situation, the 40,000 yuan mark is very easy to break through. As for the American New York market, although there are telegrams asking about prices, the offered prices are harsh, and there is no hope for transactions to develop. Domestic routes, Tianjin merchants are moving ineffectively, while this street and Suzhou-Wuxi and other places are very smooth, and the situation is firmly unchanged.</p>
<h3>Wuxi Silkworm Season is Still Good; Mulberry Leaf Price is 11,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>[Wuxi News] The weather has been warm for several days, and the development of spring silkworms in the countryside is good. The early silkworms have already spun cocoons, the large batch is shedding leaves after the big sleep, and the late batch is in the third sleep stage. The early batch of spring silkworms in Houzhai, Shengli Fang, and Qiaodong have all had their big sleep, and the silkworms are healthy. However, the price of mulberry leaves has soared. The price was previously 6,000 yuan per load, but now it has risen to 11,000 yuan due to the influence of rice prices.</p>
<h3>Social Bureau Has Agreed Yesterday; Regulated Price Flour Sales Method; Preparation Ready to Go into Effect Soon; List of Sales Points Decided</h3>
<p>In order to relieve the people's food shortage, the Social Bureau has agreed with the office of the Special Commissioner of the Grain Department to sell regulated-price flour on a regular basis. Fifty rice shops in the city have been designated to sell it widely. The bureau specially convened the persons in charge of each of these rice shops at 10:00 AM yesterday to discuss the implementation method. It was decided that each store should sell flour at a regulated price at a rate of 20 bags per day, until it is sold out. Every morning, the Grain Administration Special Commissioner's Office will send the flour to each rice shop by car for sale that day. The time is from 2:00 PM to 6:00 PM. Each household should purchase based on their household registration card, up to six catties per household, at 250 yuan per catty. The proceeds from the sales of each store should be submitted every five days to the Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank and its branches for collection and forwarding. If the amount of flour purchased by each buyer is short or if there is corruption, the bureau is allowed to report it for investigation. The fifty designated rice shops are mostly located in Guomin districts such as Nanshi, Zhabei, and Huxi. Each shop will be given a handling fee of 1,000 yuan per bag. The retail price will be reviewed and announced once a week, and each sales point must display a sign for public knowledge. The names of the rice shops have been found out as follows: Gongyi, Tongfeng, Wanxiang, Zhihe, Desheng Gong, Hongsheng, Tongfaxin, Yongfu, Hongshengtai, Hetai, Hengkang, Huang Changsheng, Yinchang, Baocheng, Mintai, Tongtai, Jiahejiang, Hefeng, Shanghai, Hongfutai, Wufu Company, Xinfeng, Hengchang, Shixing, Huasheng, Yuantai, Wanchangxin, Yonghengchang, Wanyuxin, Hengyigong, Fulong, Hongtaiyuan, Shenyuanchang, Xiefeng, Ling Wantai, Wanxing, Chenghongxing, Daxing, Wantai Xing, Yihe, Tongmao, Dong Sanyang, Longsheng, Tongsheng Taiji, Wanchangfu, Jintai, Yuanchang, Yong'an.</p>
<h3>Inactivity of Tung Oil Export</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] White tung oil has been fluctuating and stagnant, showing no signs of improvement. Recently, large quantities of Han tung oil have continued to arrive, leading to a weak and sluggish market. While the prices of other vegetable oils, especially cooking oils, have repeatedly increased, tung oil prices have remained unchanged. People are understandably dissatisfied. However, the problem lies in different sales channels, as tung oil relies entirely on export. Currently, export trade has not been adjusted, leaving exporters unable to develop, and the market with little change, creating a situation of long-term stagnation and short-term spurts. The local selling price has recently decreased slightly, with white tung oil at 66,000 yuan, West Fuhongjiang tung oil at 82,000 yuan per barrel, and local Hong oil at 63,000 to 4,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Before the war, the annual export volume of tung oil consistently reached over 70,000 tons. The price of tung seeds for producing tung oil before the war was twice that of grain. During the war, it was only one-third. In the provinces of Sichuan, Hunan, and Hubei, farmers increased grain production and cut down tung trees.</p>
<p>Although there are no accurate statistics on China's tung oil production in recent years, according to the export figures from Shanghai since the victory, the output is less than 2,000 tons. The export from Sichuan, Shaanxi, Guangxi, Hunan, Hubei, Zhejiang, and Anhui has been cut off for the past eight years, and the stock in each place is also very weak. Domestic transportation is not smooth, and shipping is difficult. However, without export activity, the market cannot improve even if freight is unimpeded. Furthermore, tung oil export is more difficult than other materials because of its low price and heavy weight. Therefore, exporters were active at the time of victory, but are now experiencing a return to inactivity. Most exporters are now shrinking their operations or switching to import trade, waiting for future developments.</p>
<p>The United States has a great need for tung oil, and the price in New York has increased three times compared to pre-war levels (currently 38 cents per pound). However, given the high value of general agricultural products in our country, this price is still far from the domestic price.</p>
<h3>Loan and Deposit Businesses</h3>
<p>Must Not Be Operated Without Authorization</p>
<p>Shanghai Branches Are Considered Branches</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] According to Article 2 of the Banking Management Regulations issued by the Ministry of Finance, any commercial bank establishing a branch must first apply to the Ministry of Finance for approval. Before approval, it must not be established without authorization, nor should it cleverly create other names to conduct loan and deposit businesses. Although the regulations are strict, some branches in Shanghai are operating deposit and loan businesses under the guise of Shanghai Branches, which has come to the attention of the Ministry of Finance, which has wired orders to the relevant authorities in Shanghai to strictly prohibit this.</p>
<h3>Mayor Wu Earnestly Informs Rice Merchants to Sincerely Comply with Emergency Measures; Legitimate Transactions Will Be Protected by Law</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] After Mayor Wu Guozhen took office, he announced four emergency measures to stabilize grain prices in the city, which gradually led to a decline in rice and grain prices. Yesterday afternoon at 3 PM, Wu met with Wan Molin, the chairman of the Bean and Rice Industry Association, to hear reports. It was reported that rice prices in the city continued to fall by 5,000 to 6,000 yuan yesterday, and the bean and rice industry sincerely supports the government's measures. Mayor Wu told them that the government will fully protect legitimate merchants, and he hopes that legitimate merchants will also do their best to assist the government. The four emergency measures announced the day before must be thoroughly implemented to stabilize grain prices and ensure the people's livelihood. He asked Wan to inform all bean and rice industries in the city to comply with the measures. Wan said that he would inform all bean and rice industries in the city to comply.</p>
<h3>Social Affairs Bureau Explains the Purpose of Registering Rice Stocks</h3>
<p>Registering rice stocks is one of the emergency measures adopted by the authorities to stabilize rice prices. The Social Affairs Bureau is gradually promoting this. A reporter from the Central News Agency, in order to understand the current situation and future handling of this matter, visited Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau and was granted an interview. The following are excerpts from the questions and answers at that time:</p>
<p>Question: How is the registration of rice stocks being handled by your bureau?</p>
<p>Answer: Very smoothly. Many people come to the bureau every day to inquire about the filing procedures.</p>
<p>Question: Should rice stock owners report to their respective industry associations, or can they apply directly to your bureau for registration?</p>
<p>Answer: The principle is to report to the respective industry associations first, and then have the association report to us. However, if they are not related to any association, they can register directly with our bureau.</p>
<p>Question: What will be done after registration?</p>
<p>Answer: First, we will conduct random inspections; second, we will make public announcements; and third, we will appropriately observe the market supply and demand situation and supervise sales at any time to maintain the people's food supply.</p>
<p>Question: If the public reports on national rice but cannot clearly understand the situation, can they be allowed to consult the registration book in your bureau?</p>
<p>Answer: Of course, they can be allowed.</p>
<p>Question: What will be done with the rice that arrives daily after the registration period expires?</p>
<p>Answer: Newly arrived rice is still allowed to be registered at any time, without any restrictions.</p>
<p>Question: If there is a sale or movement after registration, should permission be applied for in advance, or should a movement permit be issued?</p>
<p>Answer: There is no need to apply for permission in advance, and our bureau will not issue movement certificates. However, the transaction price, quantity, and the names of the buyer and seller should still be reported to the association and then to the bureau for verification. It should be understood that the purpose of this registration of rice stocks is to: (1) clearly understand the exact amount of stocks; (2) crack down on hoarding; and (3) prohibit non-industry individuals from operating in grain, in order to bring rice prices down naturally. That is all. There are no other effects. Our bureau will still protect legitimate transactions and the procurement of grain by rice merchants in accordance with the law, and there are no new restrictions or special procedures.</p>
<p>Question: Are there any fees for registration?</p>
<p>Answer: There are no fees.</p>
<p>Question: Has a period of implementation been predetermined for this measure?</p>
<p>Answer: No. Once rice prices return to normal and the market returns to normal, we can report to the municipal government and end it at any time.</p>
<h3>Sales in Stores Greatly Reduced; Rice Prices Continue to Fall</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the rice market remained stagnant, with a sharp decline in sales by stores. People were weak and uncertain, and more rice continued to plummet by 5,000 to 6,000 yuan. Xian rice also fell by 3,000 to 4,000 yuan. Flour sales in stores decreased, and there was little trading, resulting in a decline of 700 to 800 yuan. There was no export route for soybeans, and the local market was weak. High-quality goods remained stable, but medium and low-quality goods fell by another 1,000 yuan. Soybean cakes followed suit and continued to weaken by 200 to 300 yuan. Bran sales were sluggish, and prices gradually declined, dropping by another 200 to 300 yuan. After a small price drop in the oil market, some activity resumed. However, the market was weak in the morning and stabilized at noon. Yesterday, according to the rice market information, a total of more than 6,000 piculs of rice arrived in the city, with the following types and picul numbers: White Geng 3,155 piculs, Bo Dao 730 piculs, Early Rice 82 piculs, Yang Xian 615 piculs, Du Xian 509 piculs, Wu Xian 420 piculs, Bai Yuan 55 piculs, Yin Yuan 85 piculs.</p>

<h3>A Sketch of Dr. John Lucian Savage, the Great Designer of the Yangtze River Dam</h3>
<p>— Special Translation by the Editorial Department of This Newspaper</p>
<p>If you are looking for an engineer to build a dam on the Mississippi River, the Amazon River, or other large rivers, and to use hydroelectric power to supply homes and industries, you must find Dr. Savage. Only he can solve this problem.</p>
<p>He looks like a strict and kind grandfather, but in reality, he is a welcome companion to many young people everywhere. He does not smoke, drink, or swear, but he has hiked or ridden over the Rocky Mountains, the Himalayas, and other treacherous mountain ranges.</p>
<p>Sixty-Six Years Old, Still Diligently Serving</p>
<p>Dr. Savage has designed more dams than anyone else in history. Many countries are now eager for his guidance. At least sixty dams have been built according to his plans, with a value of over one billion US dollars. The power generated by the hydroelectric power plants he designed and built is likely beyond Edison's dreams.</p>
<p>Dr. Savage presided over the design of the Boulder Dam in Colorado during President Hoover's term. This was an unprecedentedly difficult dam project at the time. Later, Savage designed two even larger power generation and irrigation dams for President Roosevelt: the Grand Coulee Dam on the Columbia River—the largest man-made structure in the world today—and the Shasta Dam in California.</p>
<p>You may think that Dr. Savage has achieved so much and, at the age of sixty-six, should retire. Indeed, from 1903 until last year, except for an eight-year hiatus, he has diligently served the US Reclamation Bureau and has never stopped working. However, this giant of dam construction is now concentrating on an unprecedentedly great plan.</p>
<p>A Massive Project, Excavating Twenty Tunnels</p>
<p>This plan involves placing millions of pounds of cement in the Three Gorges of the Yangtze River, generating five times the power of the Grand Coulee Dam. The idea of using the Yangtze River's water power was first initiated by the founding father of China, Dr. Sun Yat-sen. President Chiang Kai-shek was greatly inspired by Dr. Savage's grand plan and decided to enlist the help of this American dam expert to assist China in developing all of its natural resources.</p>
<p>Dr. Savage's Yangtze River dam project is almost equivalent to channeling the Mississippi River into the Grand Canyon and then blocking it. Compared to it, the Boulder Dam in Colorado is like a small wizard seeing a great wizard.</p>
<p>At the site of this massive project, there are steep cliffs above and turbulent waves below. Dr. Savage estimates that the amount of water that needs to be discharged is five times that of the Boulder Dam, so he has to excavate twenty tunnels, each fifty feet in diameter, through the mountains, because the Boulder Dam has four similar tunnels.</p>
<p>The cost of the Yangtze River dam project is estimated at one billion US dollars. Once the dam is completed, ocean-going vessels will be able to sail upstream for more than a thousand miles, reaching the capital Chongqing.</p>
<p>The world's largest lock gate can only lift ships by fifty to sixty feet at most. Now Dr. Savage plans to build an unparalleled gate and tunnel system, allowing giant ships to enter the tunnel and then be lifted by huge cranes up to the top of the gate, 530 feet high.</p>
<p>The Yangtze River dam's power distribution area is inhabited by 140 million residents, equal to the entire population of the United States. Once Savage's plan is realized, this vast and backward region of the East will initially benefit from industrialization. Modern irrigation systems will give new life to millions of acres of old-fashioned fields, and the Yangtze River's floods will be eliminated from now on.</p>
<p>Savage's Plan Benefits Both China and the United States</p>
<p>This matter clearly has a significant impact on the global political and diplomatic landscape. Some people think that even if backward China has huge industrial potential, it does not know how to use it. Others feel that a strong China will pose a threat to American manufacturers, and therefore do not approve of the US government or bankers funding China's Yangtze River plan. Before this plan can receive the help of the American financial community, officials in Washington must carefully study whether this plan to develop the Far East is beneficial to the United States.</p>
<p>Those who support this plan say that it is beneficial to the United States. They say that building a strong China and bringing the 450 million people who are friends of the United States out of misery is beneficial to the United States, because the United States needs China's cooperation to maintain peace in the Far East. Furthermore, if China remains poor and starving forever, the American business community will not be able to obtain trade benefits. After China industrializes, the United States can have 450 million good customers.</p>
<p>The late President Roosevelt specially dispatched Nelson, the former director of the War Production Board, to visit China to assist China in solving wartime production problems. Nelson met Dr. Savage in Chongqing and, after hearing his plan, was greatly excited and immediately wired Washington, strongly recommending Savage's plan. When Savage's engineering drawings arrived in Washington, some officials in the State Department did not seem very interested. However, after Nelson's constant advocacy, the US Reclamation Bureau and the Chinese government finally signed a $500,000 contract last fall. The engineers of the US Reclamation Bureau stationed at the Denver headquarters began to study the details of the plan based on this contract, and Chinese engineers in Denver assisted. Dr. Savage officially serves as the design engineer for China.</p>
<p>White Hair, Gentle and Humble Attitude</p>
<p>Dr. Savage has a tall figure, a white beard, and an exceptionally gentle and humble attitude. A pair of bright blue eyes are embedded in a face that has become dark due to years of outdoor work. Until last year, his annual government salary never exceeded $8,750, but Savage did not mind. He said, "I am not a shrewd businessman. I am not very interested in money."</p>
<p>Savage was born on Christmas Day in 1879 on a small farm near Kirksville, Wisconsin. After growing up, he studied engineering at the University of Wisconsin in Madison. Shortly after graduating, he joined the US Reclamation Bureau.</p>
<p>Savage's first project was the water management project on the Snake River in southern Idaho, where working fourteen hours a day was a common occurrence for him. Several years later, a famous engineer named Whaley invited him to join his company, and the two jointly designed and built dams, inventing many novel ideas. Savage often tells people to this day, "Whaley taught me my engineering knowledge."</p>
<p>In 1916, Mr. Savage rejoined the US Reclamation Bureau. A few years later, he became the chief design engineer of the Denver headquarters. Savage's experience in building dams gradually became richer. In 1920, he was ordered by the government to build the Boulder Dam on the Colorado River. This was the first large dam in the world, jointly invested by the six major construction companies in the western United States, which shows the greatness of the scale. In this difficult project, Savage invented a new method of cooling 3.5 million cubic yards of cement.</p>
<p>During the Roosevelt era, construction plans sprung up everywhere like bamboo shoots after a rain. Savage and his colleagues intensified their work to rush out designs to meet the needs. When he was in Babbitt, he was suddenly summoned to preside over the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), serving as the chief design engineer for the Norris and Wheeler dams. He then presided over the design of the Coulee and Shasta dams. Soon, Savage's name spread all over the world, and governments around the world sent telegrams to Washington, inviting Savage to provide guidance.</p>
<p>The state of New South Wales in Australia was afraid that the Burrinjuck Dam there would not have an expert to manage it and that it would collapse, so it specially telegraphed Savage to attend an emergency meeting of engineers in London. Just as he was about to leave, someone discovered that there was a US law prohibiting US civil servants from accepting foreign salaries. Savage telegraphed his superiors, stating that he was willing to accept no remuneration, and then set off for London.</p>
<p>Later, the US Congress passed a bill in 1941 allowing the President to select Savage to go to Australia and India. He went to Australia to survey the Burrinjuck Dam. At this time, the Japanese army attacked Pearl Harbor. On his way back to the United States from Australia, Savage encountered the danger of submarines several times, but because he was busy writing reports, he did not notice these dangers.</p>
<p>Dam Expert Concerned About China's Problems</p>
<p>In 1944, Savage set off for China, passing through India and Afghanistan, and finally arrived in China's capital. He saw the possibility of the Three Gorges Dam on the Yangtze River—which could generate 10.05 million kilowatts, ten times the power of the Boulder Dam—and all the construction projects he had undertaken in his life (including the Boulder Dam project) were insignificant.</p>
<p>This worldwide dam expert has always been concerned about China's problems. In his report, he said: The Yangtze River development plan can be listed as one of the great achievements in human history. He firmly believes that the completion of this plan will turn China from weak to strong.</p>
<p>However, those who doubt this plan say that the Chinese are too incompetent and will never be able to build this dreamlike dam. Even if they can build it, they will not use it well. However, if you ask Savage what he thinks of the abilities of Chinese engineers, he will take out the four reports he wrote in China and frankly tell you: "These reports were able to be written so completely and so quickly, entirely thanks to the help of twenty or thirty young Chinese engineers. Some of them have had construction experience in the United States, and others are still helping to complete the final design in Denver."</p>
<p>He also said, "There is no doubt that China has stepped into the doorway of industrial development, just like the situation in the United States decades ago. Who says that China will not succeed like us?"</p>
<h3>A New Strategy for the Yellow River Project: Combined Governance of the Huai River and Water Transport – A Prerequisite for National Prosperity and the People's Well-being</h3>
<p>— Jinan Correspondence, 14th [Day of Month Unknown] - Meng Ming</p>
<p>The Question of the Existence or Abolition of the Southern Transport River: The transport river was the grain route used by past emperors for water transport. Since the southward move of the Song dynasty, fearing that the river route would supply the enemy, orders were issued to destroy it, and the regulations were completely abandoned. In the early Ming dynasty, the Yuan system was followed, utilizing maritime transport. Many ships were damaged, so the Earl of Pingjiang, Chen Xuan, and the Minister Song Li were assigned to manage the north and south transport rivers, with the sole purpose of transporting grain from the Jiangnan region to the capital. At the beginning of the river's construction, the terrain was not carefully examined, nor were water conservancy and the people's livelihood considered to create a perfect plan. Thus, reliance was placed on artificial manipulations, forcibly connecting the Yellow River, Huai River, Wen River, and Ji River into a single line, using the lakes of Weishan, Hongze, and Gaobao as temporary stops. The courses of the various rivers were inconsistent, with different storage and discharge capacities. Therefore, dikes, weirs, and dams were interspersed throughout, with officials and soldiers stationed to guard them day and night. However, the nature of water is difficult to control and cannot be subdued for long. Breaches, silting, and changes occur frequently, and repairs and bribes are used. Large-scale projects are repeatedly undertaken. Crossing the river, middle dikes, old dikes, the Clearwater Pond, the Gaojia Weir, the Jia River, the Middle River, the New River – famous ministers specializing in water management emerge one after another. Each project involves tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of laborers, using hundreds of thousands or millions of taels of silver, only to be repaired and destroyed again, ultimately failing to remedy the damage and blockage of the transport route. Now, with giant ships capable of sailing at will and land routes of railways already open, and the emperor's granary system no longer in place, the value of this transport river, which burdens the people and wastes resources to supply the court, really necessitates re-evaluation. The section of the transport river from Jiangdu to Huaiyin is called the Southern Transport River, and the section from Huaiyin to Weishan Lake is called the Middle Transport River. These two sections of the transport river are closely related to the management of the Yellow River. Opinions on the management of water transport are attached to this discussion. The remaining sections, being further away from the Yellow River, will not be discussed.</p>
<p>The West Transport River</p>
<p>For hundreds of years, Hongze Lake has been the tail end of the Huai River. The lakebed has become shallow due to siltation, and the water storage capacity has decreased year by year. Whenever the Huai River swells, Hongze Lake cannot contain it, and the surging waters gather into a vast inundation. Combined with the lakes of Gaobao and Shaobo, the boundless expanse stretches over three hundred *li*, reaching the horizon. Not only are the fields near the lake at risk of being submerged, but the transport dikes are often breached, flooding the Lixia River area, causing severe harm. Therefore, it is appropriate to take advantage of this time of combined governance of the Yellow and Huai rivers to thoroughly reorganize Hongze Lake and other lakes. From Yiyu (an appropriate location in the center of Hongze Lake, northeast of Dingyi) to Jiangdu, following an industrial plan, a transport river should be opened, passing through the centers of Hongze and Gaobao lakes, entering the Yangtze River in the south and connecting to the Yellow River in the north (a new route), named the West Transport River. This will allow the water from the lakes to flow into the rivers, turning the drained land into fertile soil, increasing farmland. The income from agricultural production and land prices can be used to fund the river opening. If demobilized soldiers are used to manage the river, the drained land should be allocated to them.</p>
<p>The East Transport River</p>
<p>East of the Southern Transport River, the lands of the seven counties, including Gaoyou and Shiyang, were formerly known as the Xiahe area. Therefore, there are thirty-six lakes, such as Sheyang and Guangyang, shaped like the bottom of a pot, serving as the tail ends of the Huai River and the waters from Chuzhou, Si River, and Tianchang. When the autumn water rises, all the waters flow into the Xiahe area as a ravine, day and night, flowing east beyond the transport river. However, along the coast of the East Sea, there is the Fan Gong Dike to block the sea tide. The water of the Xiahe area is then blocked and cannot enter the sea, stagnating and flowing horizontally, flooding fields and submerging villages, becoming a waterlogged area forever. Therefore, the Xiahe area suffers the most from flooding. Statistics show that the Xiahe area covers approximately 300,000 *qing*, of which 40% can be cultivated and 60% is lake area. Now that the new route of the Yellow River has been completed, and the waters of Chuzhou, Feng, Huai, and Si rivers are diverted by the West Transport River and the Yellow River into the Yangtze River and the sea, the Xiahe area will not suffer from the harm of the upper rivers. However, the accumulated water in the local area still needs to be drained. It is appropriate to connect the Yangtze River and the Yellow River (new route) by opening a new transport river, named the East Transport River, to guide the accumulated water in the Xiahe area, diverting it into the rivers. The long-term marshy land will be transformed into a land of abundant rice crops. Not only will the East Transport River be the primary thoroughfare connecting the rivers, but it will also drain over one hundred thousand *qing* of fertile land. The national revenue will also be considerable.</p>
<p>The Southern Transport River</p>
<p>The riverbed of this river is six *chi* higher than Hongze Lake and other lakes, and several *zhang* higher than the Huai River. The transport river has no source, so the water force is difficult to maintain and requires human effort to dredge. In this day and age, focusing on the management of water transport is actually more loss than gain. If the east and west transport rivers have been opened, and dredging water for navigation proves obviously effective, then there is no need to expend vast amounts of manpower and money to undertake large-scale construction. Only slight dredging should be done to maintain the passage of small boats. However, the salt-producing areas of Gaobao and Xingtai have traditionally relied on the opening and closing of culverts in the transport dikes to irrigate their fields. Therefore, it is appropriate to utilize the transport dikes to regulate the water volume to increase the benefits of irrigation. The Yellow River, Yangtze River, East Transport River, and West Transport River form a square area. Surrounded by these four rivers, there must be abundant water conservancy. Within this square area, several east-west parallel canals should be excavated, starting from the West Transport River and ending at the East Transport River. Branch canals and ditches should extend throughout the fields, drawing water from the West Transport River and transporting it into the canals to irrigate all the fields. The culverts on the Southern Transport River dikes should be opened and closed in a timely manner to regulate the water volume in the Lixia River area. Rain and drought should be managed according to the situation, with storage and discharge controlled by people. The area of thousands of *li* between the Yangtze and Huai rivers, which used to suffer from continuous flooding, will now have intersecting canals, with fertile land visible everywhere, becoming a prosperous land of fish and rice, with abundant wealth, comparable to Jiangnan.</p>
<p>The Middle Transport River</p>
<p>During the Ming dynasty, the transport route from Huaiyin to Weishan Lake utilized the Yellow River to facilitate water transport. In order to avoid the dangers of the Lüliang area, Li Hualong opened the Jia River during the Wanli era, from Hanzhuang to Shuzhi River Estuary, avoiding over three hundred *li* of danger on the Yellow River. Ultimately, the section of the Yellow River from Zao River to Qingkou remained dangerous and difficult, causing congestion in transport. During the Kangxi era, the Middle River was also excavated. The Jia River and the Middle River combined to form the Middle Transport River. Observing the motivation for opening the river, it was entirely supplementary in nature. Dredging and silting occurred repeatedly, and the dredging was extremely labor-intensive. Moreover, between Hanzhuang and Tai'erzhuang, a distance of eighty *li*, nine gates were placed, which is evidence of the uneven terrain. Artificial manipulation makes navigation inconvenient. It is also inadvisable to undertake large-scale construction projects, which would burden the people and harm the country. Slight dredging to allow small boats to pass is sufficient. However, to connect the north and south transport rivers, it is appropriate to open a transport river northward from the mouth of the West Transport River in Yiyu, utilizing the waters of the Bian River, Si River, and their tributaries, passing through Xuzhou to enter Weishan Lake. The old mouth of the Hanzhuang canal should be dammed to allow Weishan Lake to store water throughout the year, to facilitate water transport. Further north, the waters of the Wen River and Si River should be used to connect to Linqing and Tianjin. The area between Hanzhuang, Huaiyin, and Yiyu forms a triangular area surrounded by the Yellow River (new route), the Middle Transport River, and the New Middle Transport River. Several east-west canals can also be opened to facilitate irrigation and drainage. Between Xuzhou and Si River, for hundreds of *li*, mulberry and hemp fields, rice and japonica rice fields are intertwined, transforming the desolate area into a prosperous region.</p>
<p>The place where the transport river and the Yellow River meet is called the Yun Kou (Transport Mouth). The water of the transport river is weak, and the water of the Yellow River is strong. Therefore, the water of the Yellow River often backflows into the Yun Kou. When the Yellow River water enters the transport river, the water force is dispersed, the downstream flow slows, and silt accumulates, causing blockage. When the downstream is blocked, the upstream breaches. The backflow of the Yellow River into the Yun Kou causes great harm and must be prevented. At each location where the transport river enters the Yellow River, the use of an upward angle should be avoided, and a downward angle should be used instead, so that the water of the Yellow River and the transport river converges and flows downward, preventing backflow and its associated harms.</p>
<h3>Recruiting Labor: Three Sources</h3>
<p>The Yellow River management plan includes the management of the Huai River and water transport. The project is grand, requiring a large number of laborers for long-term work. For the method of recruiting laborers, special provisions should be formulated to ensure organized structure, flexible command, and efficient work. The sources of laborers are divided into the following three categories:</p>
<p>(A) Demobilized Soldiers</p>
<p>The current military restructuring has already begun. Demobilized soldiers can be assigned to river management work. In the future, the success of river management will lead to the reclamation of a significant amount of new land upstream and downstream. Land should be allocated to individuals so that demobilized soldiers have land to return to.</p>
<p>(B) Conscripted Labor</p>
<p>Several tens of thousands of laborers should be conscripted from within a certain number of *li* on both sides of the river. They should provide their own tools. The *baojia* system should be used as the organization for conscripting labor. Work time should be limited to the morning. The work area should be limited to the completion of river works near their residence. The government should provide subsidies to show consideration.</p>
<p>(C) Disaster Relief Labor</p>
<p>If a certain area in the country suffers from water or drought disasters, resulting in famine and food shortages, residents who lack food can be recruited and transported to the worksite. This is disaster relief labor. The tools they use should be brought by the disaster relief laborers as much as possible. The government should provide food and lodging, which is a form of work-for-relief. When the fields in their original hometown are ripe, they should be allowed to resign from work and return home to harvest, without being detained.</p>
<p>In ancient times, river management was mostly overseen by officials who sought to achieve results in order to be recommended for promotion, without regard for the suffering of the people. The laborers they recruited were treated like cattle and horses, and supervision was strict, with the sole aim of completing the project as soon as possible. The food, drink, and lodging of the laborers were not the concern of the officials. Consequently, many suffered from diseases due to hunger, cold, and overwork, and died in the workplace, without anyone paying attention. Every time I read history to this point, I am deeply saddened. Now, our country is called the Republic of China, and the world is moving towards great unity. When large-scale projects must be undertaken, and the people are made to work hard, enduring the elements, it is all for the benefit of the nation. Therefore, the nation should provide appropriate protection for the health of the laborers. The establishment of river work hospitals and the like is necessary.</p>
<p>The Yellow River management project is vast, and the required funds are enormous. Some may doubt that the country has the financial capacity to bear such a large sum after the great war. This concern is clearly inappropriate. Now, I will offer further explanation to dispel their doubts. After Da Yu tamed the floods, the Yellow River remained peaceful for over a thousand years. By the Zhou dynasty, there were instances of breaches. During the Han dynasty, there were eight breaches of the river. The breach at the Huzi estuary during the reign of Emperor Wu was the most severe. Wang Jing's management of the Yellow River during the Eastern Han dynasty was quite effective. During the Three Kingdoms, the Two Jins, the Sui, and the Tang dynasties, river disasters were rare. During the Five Dynasties, the river breached more than ten times. During the Northern Song dynasty, there were forty-seven or eight breaches. During the Yuan dynasty, there were nineteen breaches. During the Ming dynasty, there were thirty-six breaches. River disasters were also frequent during the Qing dynasty, ultimately leading to the diversion of the river at Fenglan, returning to the Bohai Sea. The above are all large-scale breaches recorded in historical records. Among them, there were also instances of several breaches in one year or one breach in several years, requiring the mobilization of tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of people to block them. Some breaches took one or two years to close, while others took several years to close. The longest took more than twenty years to close. In addition to blocking breaches, there were also annual repair projects. As the saying goes, "Treasury funds are wasted on annual repairs, and the people dread blocking breaches," yet even then, one year of peace cannot be guaranteed. It is truly lamentable. If we thoroughly calculate the losses of life and property caused by river breaches, as well as the waste of materials, labor, and levies during river closure, we will know how enormous the losses from river disasters are and how deep the suffering inflicted on the people is. Moreover, since the late Qing dynasty, with the corruption of politics and the deception of superiors and subordinates, river official positions have become lucrative posts, and river works have become sources of profit. As a result, river defenses have deteriorated greatly, with dangerous worksites everywhere. It is even more impossible to ask about them. If repairs are not made in a timely manner, it is simply treating human lives like grass. The harm is unimaginable. At this time when the whole country is advocating for construction, the Yellow River should be thoroughly repaired once and for all.</p>
<p>Yellow River management is a century-long plan for the nation. Combined governance of the Huai River and water transport, stretching for thousands of *li*, is also one of the world's major projects. Because the project is grand, detailed investigation, research, surveying, and measurement should be conducted first, with technical discussions to compare gains and losses, advantages and disadvantages. Then, a plan should be formulated, a construction schedule should be prepared, and progress should be made step by step, following the proper order. Without seeing small profits, without rushing for immediate results, success will not be difficult to achieve, benefiting the country and the people, and providing endless benefits. Now, I will add a few points below: (1) Since the Song, Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties, the focus on the Yellow River has not been on river management, but only on river defense, which can be called a river defense policy, far from the true meaning of river management. The discussion in this article aims to thoroughly manage the entire river from beginning to end, once and for all. However, individual intelligence is limited. I sincerely hope that social elites will rise up to discuss and research, so that the river management plan is sound and usable. (2) The discussion in this article is all about principles. As for detailed plans, such as whether the Yellow River's mouth into the sea should use the Guan River estuary or the old Yellow River estuary, and whether a certain section of the Huai River should be straightened, etc., experts must be waited on to formulate them. (3) Since the War of Resistance, the trenches dug by the national army in various places, the traffic trenches opened by local troops, and the obstruction ditches dug by the enemy puppets in railways and towns, if the total number is calculated, may be larger than the Yellow River diversion project. Also, the mountain caves dug by the enemy army in various important strongholds to store military supplies are larger in scale than the project of excavating the Niaoshu Mountain. It can be seen that as long as the Yellow River management project concentrates its forces, it will definitely succeed. The above plans should not be made difficult to do because the project is huge, and the psychology of complacency should not be generated. It must be given great wisdom and great courage, and put into practice. It must be known that if the Yellow River is not managed for a long time and the Yellow River breaches, the losses to the country will definitely be no less than the river management funds.</p>
<p>This time, I went to Beijing to report and attend the preparatory meeting for the National Assembly, which was held twelve times and adjourned on the 13th. An adjournment speech was given. During the adjournment period, all affairs are handled by the secretariat. A second preparatory meeting will be held when necessary. In other words, before the opening of the National Assembly, the organization of this preparatory meeting will not be eliminated. "Adjournment" only means that the general meeting is not open for the time being.</p>
<h3>Report from Beijing</h3>
<p>— Zhu Fengwei</p>
<p>Approximately 500 National Assembly representatives have reported to Beijing this time, exceeding half of the total number of popularly elected representatives. Their regions include overseas Chinese, Tibet, Mongol Banners, Gansu, Shaanxi, Shanxi, Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, Guangdong, Guangxi, Hunan, Hubei, Henan, Fujian, Shandong, Xikang, Jiangxi, Qinghai, Anhui, Xinjiang, Jiangxi, Zhejiang, Shanghai Municipality, Nanjing Municipality, and 30 national-level units for lawyers, accountants, doctors, journalists, and educators. Each unit nominates one chairman and one to three executive officers to form two organizations: the presidium and the executive committee. The executive committee operates under the direction of the presidium, handling affairs through seven groups, including general affairs, documentation, and finance. The presidium meets one hour before each general assembly session to organize the agenda for the day, appoint seven chairmen to preside over the session, and then those seven chairmen appoint one overall chairman (on a rotating basis, cyclical and repetitive). These four to five hundred representatives have come from all over the country, traversing thousands of mountains and rivers. Although the official opening date of the National Assembly remains pending, the preparatory meetings are sufficient to demonstrate the spirit of unity and the powerful capabilities of the representatives of the entire nation, and the results are excellent, which is truly fortunate.</p>
<p>Since the assembly has been adjourned, everything is in the past. However, one matter seems worth further recounting: the visits. The visits were divided into two groups: one group to visit General Marshall, with Zhu Jingnong, Xi Yushu, Zhang Jingyu, and Hu Jingan nominated as the four representatives. Apparently, the collection of evidence of the Communist army's ravaging of Shandong and northern Jiangsu was incomplete, causing a delay in its implementation. The other group nominated Lin Hu, Huang Zhida, Su Cunpu, He Bingru, Jia Hongzhu, and myself (I, the undersigned, being the convener) to visit Shao Lizi, Wu Tiecheng, Chen Cheng, Chen Lifu, and Zhang Lisheng. (These five seem to be government representatives to the Political Consultative Conference, with Sun Ke, Zhang Qun, and Chen Bulei as three others, all not in Beijing at this time. If I am correct, it should be Wang Shijie instead of Chen Cheng.) The objectives of the visit included: (1) The reasons for the postponement of the convocation of the National Assembly. (2) If the postponement is indefinite, to what date or time will it be extended? (3) Should the representatives who have come to Beijing continue to report and be accommodated? (4) To urge the government to set a date for the convocation of the assembly as soon as possible, and to appeal to the government to immediately recover the northeastern provinces, quell the war in Shandong and northern Jiangsu, unify the country, return power to the people, and implement constitutional governance. Due to time and business constraints, the visits to the five individuals were spread over three days: The first day was a visit to Zhang Lisheng, Minister of Interior and Chief Supervisor of National Assembly elections. The second day involved visiting Shao Lizi, Chairman of the National Assembly Preparatory Committee and Central Standing Committee Member Wu Tiecheng, Secretary-General of the Central Party Headquarters. The third day was a visit to Chen Lifu, Minister of Central Organization and member of the National Assembly Preparatory Committee, and Minister of Military Affairs Chen [blank].</p>
<p>Minister Zhang's Words were Gentle and Sincere</p>
<p>We visited Zhang Lisheng at the Ministry of Interior, and Minister Zhang's attitude and language were exceptionally sincere. He spoke excellent Beijing dialect, crisp and clear. All six of us representatives spoke in turn. Zhang listened attentively to the statements of the six representatives and then provided a comprehensive response. He said:</p>
<p>"Representatives, you have come to Beijing to report, traveling arduously and enduring great hardship. On the 25th, we suddenly saw the government's order indefinitely postponing the assembly date, which naturally caused resentment. This action, from the government's perspective, certainly has unavoidable difficulties, but losing faith with the representatives is difficult to excuse. Therefore, it would be best if the representatives could forgive the government; otherwise, if you wish to condemn the government, the government will accept it without argument. However, please do not condemn other parties, as that would increase the government's difficulties and would not benefit the National Assembly itself. Although the National Assembly has been postponed indefinitely, judging from the situation, it should not be too far off. Your opinions will naturally be conveyed to the government, and the government will certainly find ways to resolve the difficulties and obstacles so that the National Assembly can convene as soon as possible. Now that representatives from various provinces have already arrived in Beijing, the government would be embarrassed to ask the representatives to return and cannot simply stop providing accommodations. On this point, you can rest assured. I am one of the responsible individuals handling this matter and must express my apologies to you all!"</p>
<p>We felt that Minister Zhang's words were gentle and sincere. After listening to his response, we could not help but express partial satisfaction amidst our dissatisfaction. We then left the Ministry of Interior and headed to Langya Road to visit Shao Lizi, Chairman of the National Assembly Preparatory Committee and the government representative to the Political Consultative Conference who had the most contact with the Communist Zhou Enlai.</p>
<p>Chairman Shao's Answer Missed the Point</p>
<p>Mr. Shao and I are old friends, and Lin Yinqing (Hu) is also well acquainted with Shao. However, today we are discussing official business, so let's speak seriously. We reiterated to Shao what we had said to Zhang Lisheng, particularly emphasizing the tone, and questioned the government's concession to the demands of a small number of parties, even to the point of indefinitely postponing the National Assembly, losing faith with the people of the entire nation, and the failure of the Political Consultative Conference. How will the government handle the Communist army's occupation of Changchun and harassment of northern Jiangsu and Shandong? Will it allow them to run rampant and tolerate them to the end? However, Mr. Shao's response addressed the first part of the matter by speaking about the past, while the second part of his answer missed the point. He said, "Of the 38 representatives to the Political Consultative Conference, only 10 supported the validity of the representatives elected in 1936. The government worked painstakingly to give up 260 of the 460 Central Committee seats and added 440 more, totaling 700, to be distributed among the various parties, in order to gain recognition of the validity of the old representatives. As for the indefinite postponement of the National Assembly, it was because the various parties had not submitted their lists of representatives by April 24th, which forced the government to announce the postponement. At the same time, it instructed election offices nationwide to notify the representatives to halt their journeys and temporarily postpone reporting. Now, the representatives are coming to Beijing one after another and holding preparatory meetings, which is really without legal basis. Judging from the situation, it seems unlikely that the assembly can be convened before autumn. The government cannot provide long-term accommodations and should ask the representatives to return temporarily. It's like inviting guests, but the host's dishes are not ready, so he asks for a postponement. It's also like a company calling a shareholders' meeting, but too many shareholders are absent, so the manager announces a postponement. Both are normal and not surprising. As for the Political Consultative Conference, it was absolutely successful, and the future of the political situation is absolutely optimistic..."</p>
<p>The six representatives, having heard this, were extremely indignant. What Shao said did not sound like a member of the Kuomintang Central Committee, let alone the Chairman of the National Assembly Preparatory Committee. We refuted Shao's words one by one. The main point was that the preparatory meeting was based on the government's scheduled convocation of the National Assembly. To prepare everything before the assembly, how could it be described as "without legal basis"? Then, how could the Political Consultative Conference be considered to have legal basis? Representatives from various provinces and cities cannot be summoned and dismissed by the government at will. The representatives will not return until the assembly is convened. People across the country see the Political Consultative Conference as a failure, yet you alone arbitrarily claim it to be a success, truly possessing a unique perspective. The analogy of inviting guests and holding shareholders' meetings is inappropriate. Even with inviting guests and holding meetings, one cannot simply break faith. The Communist army is attacking and seizing territory everywhere, slaughtering the people, yet you do not mention it at all, which is truly unexpected. The two sides debated back and forth, but ultimately we achieved no resolution. The six representatives returned to report to the assembly, all indignant, which led to the scene of accusations erupting during Mr. Shao's tea reception for all the representatives on the afternoon of the sixth.</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang Adopted the Opinions of the Masses</p>
<p>At 7:00 a.m. on the morning of the sixth, Mr. Shao visited me at the Political Academy dormitory. Having been friends with Mr. Shao for thirty years, I informed him that the overall impression of him among the representatives was extremely negative. I advised him to consider his words carefully when speaking at the afternoon tea reception. Shao agreed and visited Representative Lin Yinqing (Hu) for tea, and Lin also advised him in the same way. Unexpectedly, Shao still stubbornly insisted on his own views at the tea reception and reiterated what he had said in response to the six representatives. (Mr. Chen Lifu was sitting next to me at the time. Hearing Shao's words, he stamped his feet and said repeatedly, "This is terrible, what should we do?") This aroused the resentment of all the representatives, and accusations erupted, creating a tumultuous scene that shook the roof tiles, almost preventing Mr. Shao from escaping. In all fairness, Shao insulted others and was then insulted himself, bringing it upon himself. (At 4:00 p.m. on the afternoon of the seventh, Chairman Chiang held a tea reception for all the representatives at the Lixing Society. The Chairman's attitude was gentle and sincere. He did not advise the representatives to return, nor did he say that the preparatory meeting was without legal basis. He also said that the convocation of the National Assembly would not be too far off. If the representatives had any opinions on national affairs, they could submit them in writing, and he (the Chairman, referring to himself) would do his best to adopt and accept them within the scope of what was possible! This shows that Shao's stubbornness was indeed a misstep.)</p>
<p>Minister Chen Dedicated Himself to National Affairs</p>
<p>At 3:00 p.m. on the afternoon of the sixth, we visited Secretary-General Wu Tiecheng at the Central Party Headquarters. Wu's attitude was modest, and he expressed acceptance of the representatives' statements. His key words were, "If there is peace, the National Assembly should convene. If there is no peace, the National Assembly should still convene. Therefore, the date of the National Assembly's convocation will not be too far off..." The six representatives felt satisfied and left.</p>
<p>At 8:00 a.m. on the morning of the seventh, we visited Minister of Central Organization Chen Lifu at his residence for a two-hour conversation. Mr. Chen Lifu was refined and elegant, and his discussions of the current situation were insightful and to the point. He deeply agreed with what the six representatives had stated and promised to convey it to the government and adopt it as much as possible. He also deeply believed that the "Political Consultative Conference had failed" and was anxious about the impending unmanageable turn of events, and he considered the government's repeated tolerance to be a misstep.</p>
<p>At 7:00 p.m. on the afternoon of the seventh, we visited Minister of Military Affairs General Chen Cixiu (Cheng) at his residence on Pudu Road for a long two-hour conversation. General Chen, not yet fifty, already had graying temples, showing his hard work and dedication to national affairs. He said that an army general's monthly salary was 120,000, and his wife (Miss Tan Zu'an's daughter, named Xiang) pawned her jewelry to help with household expenses, barely making ends meet. He said that the military downsizing and reorganization was being strictly implemented, and even the units of Yan Baichuan in Shanxi and Lu Han in Yunnan had been greatly reduced, which involved a great deal of trouble. Chen studied land administration and had gained considerable insight. He accepted all the statements of the six representatives and lamented the Communist Party's ambition and the Communist army's attacks and harassment, deeply fearing that mutual tolerance would not serve the nation.

<h3>Shanghai Boys Town</h3>
<p>— Zifang</p>
<p>——A big family for homeless children</p>
<p>The eight-year-long war destroyed countless peaceful and sweet families, and as a result, many homeless children living on the streets increased, in addition to begging for food, many of them were engaged in criminal activities. They not only hinder the appearance of the city and disrupt social order, but are also a great loss to the country; because there are no incorrigible bad children in the world, as long as these children are reasonably educated and taught life skills, they can become good and useful citizens. In the United States, this cause of educating and nurturing homeless children has achieved excellent results, and this organization is called "Boys Town."</p>
<p>In Cleveland, Ohio, there are six Boys Towns, with three thousand citizens aged eight to ten. They were all abandoned by their parents, their parents are either dead or divorced, and there are many who cannot afford to raise their children.</p>
<p>The village has police, courts, mayors, newspapers, music teams, factories, clubs, sports fields, ballrooms, and photography associations, all of which are staffed, organized and managed by teenagers or children. The teenagers and children in the village work and play together in their spare time every day, practicing cooperation and learning to abide by the law. In Boys Town, they gain new interests, new habits, and form new personalities and good social adaptability.</p>
<p>In 1937, there were 2,111 juvenile crime cases in Cleveland, but since Boys Town, the number of juvenile crime cases has been reduced to an average of 235 cases per year.</p>
<p>This is a miracle, but this miracle can happen in the United States, why can't it happen in China, in Shanghai? Therefore, recently, the Huisheng Charity Society and the Jingye Nursing Home jointly initiated the establishment of the "Shanghai Boys Town", and invited Lu Meiseng, Bi Fanyu, Zhao Puchu, and Tian Gengxin to be preparatory committee members to actively carry out the work. The Huisheng Charity Society allocated more than 100 mu of land in Dachang as the village site, and received support from Madame Chiang Song Meiling, General Wedemeyer, Deputy Mayor He De'kui, etc. On the 16th of last month, a board of directors meeting was held at the YMCA to discuss and approve the charter of Boys Town, and Lu Meiseng was elected as the chairman and Zhao Puchu as the village chief. It is admirable that Dong Hefu Guangsheng donated 20 million yuan on the spot as the funds for Boys Town, and Mr. Dong Shixu Guomao generously agreed to take on the salary of the director of education for a long time.</p>
<p>In the past and present, all children's nurseries in Shanghai only provided ordinary and outdated education to those homeless and criminal children they adopted. This kind of educational work is not enough. Boys Town has specially hired experts to organize an education committee to study how to implement education and determine the education plan. Their educational principles are to reduce forced indoctrination and encourage inspiration, to replace strict supervision with trust and love, to eliminate the existing bad behaviors and habits of homeless and criminal children, as well as anti-social and inferiority complexes, and to cultivate the spirit of mutual assistance and cooperation, so that they can become self-respecting, self-reliant, and autonomous good citizens.</p>
<p>In the Baohua Temple in Dachang, Shanghai Boys Town is now being pioneered by two teachers and six children. It is believed that in the near future, these more than 100 mu of barren land will be reclaimed into a paradise for homeless children, and a sweet and warm big family will be built.</p>

<h3>From a Family Tragedy to Establishing a Sound Family Life</h3>
<p>— Furen</p>
<p>According to a local newspaper report on the 20th, Ms. Cheng Wang, a young woman from Anhui Province, 29 years old, married Mr. Cheng, a bank clerk from the same hometown, in 1937. Their relationship was quite harmonious after marriage, and they had two sons. Unfortunately, this good time did not last long. Cheng went to cabarets and dance halls and met a hostess named Zhu. He rented a house to live with her. His wife found out and tried to dissuade him, but to no avail. The other day, they had an argument over this matter again. Wang became angry and bought four opium pills, took two privately, and ordered her two children to take the other two. The younger child died of poisoning, and Ms. Wang is still in critical condition, it is said.</p>
<p>From the family tragedy performed by Cheng, we can think of social and ethical issues. The main cause of this tragedy was Cheng's undisciplined behavior and improper associations, which led to the wife's suicide attempt due to her husband's affair. If he could have thought that he was a married man, and should have devoted all his energy to his career and family, loved his wife, and increased the joy of family life, then this unfortunate event would not have happened. Moreover, Cheng already has two children, shouldn't he have thought about the importance of his responsibility for raising his children, and still be able to seek new love?</p>
<p>I remember Dr. Zhang Boling said in a speech: "To build a happy family, both husband and wife must be able to coordinate, understand, and forget each other's shortcomings, and always think of each other's strengths." This is indeed experienced advice that can be used as a good saying for modern families. Take Cheng for example, his relationship with his wife was not bad at first, and they lived in peace, but eventually he became tired of his wife over time and could not resist the temptation of the bad social environment, and embarked on the wrong path. It is human nature to like the new and dislike the old. Many husbands can still love their wives at first, but later they often change their original intention and turn to love other women. In this unreasonable society, women seem to be seen as playthings for entertainment and recreation in the minds of most men. A man can love several women without being criticized or sanctioned by social opinion. This poisonous influence of "valuing men over women" is often enough to destroy the organization of a sound family. Why are women willing to associate with or even cohabitate with married men? That's because a man can love several women without being regarded as a crime, and at the same time, due to the lack of true equality in knowledge and skills between men and women, women's fate is always more miserable. Marriage or cohabitation with men is sometimes the only way for a woman to solve the problem of life. One is to exchange money for "love" (such love is certainly not true love), and the other is to exchange beauty for supplies. In this case, the moral standards of society are lowered, and the happiness of families is deprived.</p>
<p>To remedy this defect, on the one hand, we must change people's incorrect and unreasonable views on both sexes and promote the realization of a true monogamous system. We not only hope that the law stipulates a monogamous system, but also have to shift the bad social customs in ethical concepts. Establish appropriate and normal relationships between the sexes. On the other hand, we demand the establishment of a sound family life, improve the adaptability of both sexes to family life, and enable husband and wife to maintain eternal harmony and continue their love life. To achieve this, we must first cultivate a sound psychology between husband and wife and strive for adaptation and improvement in life. The words of Dr. Zhang Boling mentioned above are worth remembering, especially for husbands, to recognize the profound responsibility they bear to society and family, and to look farther and bigger, and never covet temporary happiness and leave eternal regret!</p>
<p>As for wives, they should also put the entire family first. If the husband has an affair, they may sincerely advise the husband and try to increase the atmosphere of harmony and happiness in the family, and shift the husband's interest to his career and family. An ideal wife can certainly make her husband have a concern for his children and can make her husband satisfy the needs of family life. There are many women who often quarrel with their husbands. Even if the husband has done something wrong, if you want to persuade him with anger, the result will not only be ineffective, but will also cause resentment. I think sincerity can move people, as the saying goes, "Sincerity moves even metal and stone." If you use true feelings to transform a person, you are not afraid of not being able to make his heart moved. Also, wives must carefully study why their husbands are indifferent to them, why they are dissatisfied with their current family life, and why they want to have an affair. If these parents are considered, at least they can also try to remedy them and seek closeness and understanding between each other.</p>
<p>Like Cheng Wang, who sought suicide due to a momentary quarrel and driven by a fire of resentment, and even poisoned her two children to death, she may not have thought it through. This is really not a smart way. This is a "settled" passive behavior, and an extreme expression of weakness. It is even more unspeakable to commit suicide oneself and also commit suicide with children. The biggest of her motives is to reach silent resistance by "dying together" due to resentment. There is really a kind of revenge in it. There is no mother who does not love her own children, but when she is desperate (in fact, that can be regarded as despair) she can only endure the pain to sacrifice and disregard everything. And she may also think this way: You go and have fun with the newcomer, I am not worthy of your love, the children are born by me, I will leave you and accompany them to leave you together. When a person's emotions are particularly agitated and stimulated the most severely, emotions cannot control emotions, and a big mistake will be made. Anger, jealousy, disappointment, and frustration destroyed a young woman in her prime, and even destroyed her children. But she never thought about how tragic this was. The husband is certainly not good, but the children are always innocent.</p>
<p>In short, in order to avoid the occurrence of similar tragedies, we must not entrust this responsibility to the law. We must create a strong public opinion in society, shift social customs, and establish a correct and harmonious relationship between husband and wife in ethical concepts. At the same time, we can also more believe that establishing a sound family life is the most effective way to solve all family disputes and unfortunate events.</p>
<h3>Buddhist Grandma</h3>
<p>— Baling</p>
<p>"Buddhist grandma, really confused; doesn't eat meat, only eats vegetables; lights candles in the morning; does homework at night; uses copper coins, doesn't count; in the end, the family property is broken; the husband is sick, worships mud goddesses; the son is sick, eats incense ash; the husband is dead, the son is also gone; can't think of a way, goes to drown in the river; Buddhist grandma, asks for hardship."</p>
<p>This is a very accurate nursery rhyme describing the superstition of women. In Chinese society, due to the underdevelopment of women's education, most women, especially women in rural areas, are unwilling to trust doctors for medical treatment, and only worship mud Buddhas, and as a result, not only spend a lot of unjust money, but also send the patient's life, which is really an extremely pathetic thing.</p>

<h3>Suzhou's Female Sedan Chair Carriers</h3>
<p>— Junyi</p>
<p>Anyone who has visited the Dengwei and Tianping Mountains in Suzhou knows that there is a type of mixed-gender sedan chair service there, soliciting tourists going up the mountains along the way. Those engaged in this profession are all farmers from the nearby foothills. During the period when plum blossoms bloom and peaches fall, before the fields become busy, they take advantage of this free time to use carrying sedan chairs as their sole side business in the spring, in order to supplement the family's income for the year. Among them, there are not a few who carry a single sedan chair as a family unit, such as father-in-law and daughter-in-law, mother-in-law and daughter, or husband and wife. With the pairing of male and female, locals call it the "Bagua (Eight Trigrams) Chair." Although the structure of the chair is simply a rattan chair installed between two bamboo poles, adding the weight of the passenger, it also weighs between one and two hundred catties. Because these women usually work in the fields and wade in water, they are accustomed to the training. When carrying the chair, they appear effortless. Even robust women with abundant hair can often support a load of over a hundred catties on their shoulders, walking swiftly between the city and the countryside. It can be seen that the pampered upbringing of Suzhou women does not apply to rural women.</p>
<p>When I went to Suzhou last month, I took a trip to Tianping Mountain. According to a female sedan chair carrier, since the War of Resistance, this year has been the most prosperous in terms of tourists. The price they charge is calculated by mileage, and they must also collect snack money along the way. Each person earns approximately fifteen to sixteen thousand yuan per day. If there is not much rain, they can even earn twenty to thirty thousand. Speaking of their demands for snack money, it is akin to extortion. If one refuses to pay, they will stop you halfway and not proceed, forcing the sitter to grudgingly pay a certain amount. Some tourists who are familiar with the situation specify in advance that the fee includes everything, and they can do nothing about it.</p>
<p>In the midst of the high-pitched promotion of women's occupational movement, we should naturally admire these female sedan chair carriers who are hardworking and resilient and rely on their own strength to earn a living. Although tourists inevitably feel resentment due to their unreasonable demands, they are ultimately much more refined than the general unearned-gain merchants. Moreover, they have not received any education at all and should be forgiven leniently!</p>

<h3>Taiwan's Massage</h3>
<p>— Naifan</p>
<p>The twilight in Taiwan is relaxing and cool. The quiet asphalt road, the yellow sand that flew during the day, has already been cleansed by the tropical wind. Tall coconut trees stand tall in the night, like giant statues. At this time, there will be short flute sounds, light, clear, and melancholic, passing into your ears. These sounds rise and fall, and are definitely not the chanting of poets, nor the playing of wanderers. They are a group of professionals, and their profession is massage.</p>
<p>Just like those fortune tellers who wander the streets of Jiangnan towns, the masseurs in Taiwan are all blind. There are men and women, and they wander the streets like ghosts, relying on a cane or being led by a child.</p>
<p>Taiwanese people bathe in their own homes. After bathing, massage is a kind of enjoyment. The technique of the masseurs is exceptionally skillful. They squat beside you like cats or eagles, and with their two skilled hands, delicately and precisely, knead all the joints of your body. This makes you feel like you have done a strenuous exercise, and also like you have had a comfortable sleep.</p>
<p>Each massage takes about half an hour. With the rise of prices, the price of each session has also risen from ten yuan to thirty yuan.</p>
