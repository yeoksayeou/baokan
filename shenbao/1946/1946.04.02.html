<h3>蔣主席在參政會政詞　闡釋政府戰後措施　力言中蘇合作重要性</h3>
<p>〔中央社重慶一日電〕參政會一日晨舉行第十八次會議，蔣主席十一時十五分親自出席，於全體起立熱烈掌聲中登講台致詞，報吿抗戰結束後政府重要措施，對（一）東北問題，（二）伊寗問題，（三）憲草問題說明政府方針與處理經過，闡釋甚詳。主席首對參政會兩週來未能常到會與各參政員硏討表示歉意，繼謂：抗戰結束後六個月來，政府之重要措施與目標，乃在爭取國內和平安定與共謀世界和平安全，主席於歷述召開政治協商會議，成立軍事調處執行部與制定整編軍隊基本方案等重要揹施後，並就東北問題，伊寗問題及憲草問題分別說明政府之方針與處理經過情形，歷一小時零五分，詞畢，羅參政員霞天等提議擁護蔣主席報吿案，經主席付表決，通　，十二時半散會。下午七時半，主席在軍委會大禮堂，邀宴全體參政員備致讚許。</p>
<p>〔合衆社重慶一日電〕蔣主席一日在參政會致詞，力言中蘇合作爲遠東以及全世界幸福之基本原則。渠稱：蘇聯希望和平一如中國，故將信守中蘇友好條約及其附件，因此係兩國合作之基礎。</p>
<p>蘇聯令東北駐軍直接與我商交替</p>
<p>蒋主席謂：國府於答覆蘇軍撤退之照會中，已要求蘇方確切說明蘇軍行將撤退各地，並請其協助國軍進行接收工作。渠稱：蘇聯已訓令東北蘇軍司令部與董彥平將軍直接會商接收事宜。蔣主席力言東北必不能有政治問題，並指責爲滿足本身利益而造成政治問題之政黨或個人，妨礙接收工作，並增加外交上之困難。主席干報吿一九四四年十一月初之新　事件時，承認曾有一時情勢極爲嚴重。去年迪化之安全曾遭極大威脅，爲解決此項問題起見，政府派張治中將軍赴新疆，討論結果，包括十一點之協定一種，自下大致已吿成立。渠指出新疆在地理上及經濟上與蘇聯有密切關係，是故與新疆及蘇聯同時保持友好關係實屬重要。但渠同意按照中蘇條約，新疆爲中國內政之一部，蘇聯將不予干涉。</p>
<p>除由國大制憲外無任何法制可代</p>
<p>蔣主席繼謂，二中全會認爲政治協商會議之四項決議與憲法相牴觸，渠謂：政治協商會議規定，遇立法院不信任行政院時，行政院得提出辭職或要求總統解散立法院，但行政院長要求解散立法院不得超過一次以上。二中全會建議：行政院不應對立法院負責，亦無要求解散立法院之權，共產黨並朱指定參加政府之該黨黨員，亦未將國大代表姓名送交國民大會，蔣主席對此表示遺憾。續稱：「共產黨建議廢止臨時憲法，組織各黨各派之新政府，吾人表示驚異一。除國民大會通過之憲法外，任何法制均不能取而代之，政治協商會議所成立之擴大現政府之協議，亦即推翻現政府之謂」。蔣主席感謝杜魯門總統派遣馬歇爾特使來華，俾促成中國和平團結之至意。</p>

<h3>魏德邁後日返國　昨舉行末次記者招待會　席間暢述美軍今後任務</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中國戰區美軍總司令魏德邁將軍，將於本月四日啓程取道關島，珍珠港，及加利福尼亞，返華盛頓述職，並將在美延醫施行輕微手術，稍作休養後，可能再度來華。昨日上午十一時半在建設大厦舉行返國前最後一次記者會，由繼任駐華美軍訓司令麥第克少將陪同出席。</p>
<p>美軍總部下月撤銷</p>
<p>魏將軍稱：中國戰區美軍總部將於五月一日正式撤銷，但撤消後尙有若干人員留華，其主要工作可分五類：（一）處置美軍剩餘物資，（三）助華完成遣送日軍及僑民，並運送中國軍隊及軍器，（三）協助中國政府訓練軍隊及顧問事務，（四）協助馬歇爾特使在北平調處中共問題，（五）處理美軍善後事宜，如整理墳墓及搜覓美軍失蹤人員等。</p>
<p>中國區美軍復員工作，始於一九四四年十月，美軍人員已自六萬五千人之最高峯减至六千人，美軍人員在四月份繼續撤退後，中國區之美軍人員將僅剩五千人，且所有戰鬥隊伍均將撤退，同時，美軍陸戰隊人數亦自五萬三千人减至三萬四千人，並將繼續减少。中國戰區司令部結束後，陸戰隊改由海軍指揮。凡五月一日以後，所不需要之人員，決不留於中國。凡未有資格撤退之官兵，或將另授以其他工作。</p>
<p>協助撤退東北日軍</p>
<p>關於派赴東北調處執行，但現已出發，美軍人員不久亦可前往担任撤退日軍工作，至搜査東北美軍失蹤人員，目前僅在中國軍隊管轄範圍內施行，如該區域擴大，則美軍搜覓範圍，亦常隨之擴展。處理善後事宜人員，除協助馬歇爾特使外，空軍人員需要亦多，蓋不僅爲訓練中國空軍，並需協助中航公司，美軍官員尙有三百或四百人來華，彼等乃有專門技術及經騐者，對訓練工作，當有所貢獻。在渝美軍人員在政府還都後，亦將於五月一日全部解散，目前尙有數百人需協助美大使館遷移工作。</p>
<p>基倫中將繼任司令</p>
<p>中國戰區美軍總部結束後，改名爲駐華華美陸軍司令部，魏將軍離華後，其任務由基倫中將繼任，至五月一日後改爲在華美陸軍總司令，但基倫將軍乃代表馬歇爾特使，須在北平担任工作，不克時常來滬，在滬美軍主管任務，由副司令麥第克將軍代理，麥克魯將軍則在南京籌備美軍事顧問團事宜，該團目前尙未開始工作。又美軍總部新聞聯絡組組長卡脫中校·業已返滬，特由魏將軍在席間介紹。</p>
<p>魏將軍繼稱：曾由蔣主席授與靑天白日勳章，渠謂此勳章實爲美軍所共有，乃表示過去十八月間美軍官兵之功績，對彼等表示謝意。最後由中國記者及美記者相繼代表本市記者向魏將軍致敬，並希望魏將軍能再度返華，魏將軍除答謝外並向翻譯員鄧樹勛致讚揚之意。</p>

<h3>蘇聯尚無答覆徵象　安理會仍難樂觀　葛羅米柯繼續保持緘默　蘇外交遞信員携重要公交飛美</h3>
<p>〔合衆社紐的卅一日電〕安全理事會休會已二日，關於聯合國要求蘇伊兩國說明蘇軍撤退談判真相一節，蘇聯是否將予答覆，尙無新的啓示，因此安全理事會代表之樂觀態度今日已見减退。蘇聯大使葛羅米柯繼續保持緘默，拒絕對記者發表意見，但記者詢以渠曾吾接到克林姆宮之訓令時，葛氏答稱：「余正如其他代表，隨時與本國政府取得聯繫。」渠並未表明蘇聯政府有何行動。安全理事會代表咸希望蘇伊政府早日答復，俾理事會取得蘇軍撤退之保證，蘇聯要求伊朗讓步可趨緩和，同時葛羅米柯可於星期三重行參加理事會議。據伊駐美大使稱：蘇軍撤退之說，雖甚囂塵上，但亞塞爾拜然·吉蘭·馬桑地蘭。高甘及科拉桑等地區仍有蘇軍留駐。</p>

<h3>經濟復員與工潮</h3>
<p>目前朝野上下，都擔心着中國的經濟復員，尤其是工業建設，有沒有趕快收效的希望。中國的工業建設，在西洋先進國家看來，眞所謂「後生可畏」，爲什麽我們現在選要發出「有沒有希望」這樣的疑問呢？說來很簡單，因爲目前若干當局似乎還沒有把鼓勵生產認眞當作一回事，有時甚至在有意無意之問，反而阻礙生產或斷傷生產。經濟復員是國家大規模經濟建設的初步工作，而此初步的經濟復員，其第一義即是生產。可是如今生產偏只爲一般人所口頭提及而不是實際重視，於是經濟復員便遭受了莫大的創傷，——甚至可以說中國工業在襁褓中就將遭受到致命傷！</p>
<p>古今中外，講論經濟的著作儘管多、可是最簡明而重要的話，莫過於大學中「生之者衆，食之者寡，爲之者疾，用之者舒』的四句。我們現當大戰以後，兵費方平，瘡痍未復。勝利雖已七個月，交通還未全通，秩序也沒有大定。後方關廠，前方封廠的怪象，至今並沒有多大改善。物價高昂，生活不安，各地工潮，尤其是上海，風起雲河，好像傳染病一般。在這種情况下，罷工怠工旣視爲家常使飯，則離開「爲之者疾」的名言，不知幾千萬里。而其結果，必致舊有工廠倒閉，新興工業停擺，勞工生活更不安定，失業潮將繼工潮而起，於是勢必與一生之者衆」這句指示更將背道而馳。可是在另一方面，做工時儘管或怠或罷，失業後儘管家徒四壁，然而飯選是要吃，衣還是要穿，不但要吃要穿，而且每月要按照着「生活費指數」的比例來吃來穿，於是坐食者「衆」，待救濟者「更衆」，個人固窮，社會更窮，國家尤其要窮。假使此時我們大家就存心和平旣然光臨，人們應該享受，不間生產情况如何，更不設法去努力增進生產，却只知道要求恢復我們戰前的消費水準（所以要求照生活費指數領取薪工者，意義就在此），以爲如此纔算稱心如意，那末中國幼稚的工業，其前途必斷傷於具有此種心理者之手，到末了還不是同歸於盡？</p>
<p>國民黨二中全會通過財政金融經濟次議案，明白的說：「無論經濟財政，治標洽本，總宜增加生產，過去前尤封廠後方停工之現象，萬不可再任其存在，致使工人失業，社會不安。」現在距離二中全會閉會又已牛月了，究竟已有多少進步？據各方的表現看來，金融資本依然在股票公債上打滾，游資依然在金融圈外猖狂作祟，沒有被引導到正軌的用途上來，高利貸的惡劣現象還是“益厲害，交通運輸仍然沒有暢通，原料和一切物價照舊未能穩定，燃料因過份管制始終未能充分供應，動力據說也就將到達不能再增負担的地步（這就等於說不能再供應復工工廠的動力），凡此種種，都顯示着生產事業還是荆棘重重，使人望而裏足。不但如此，最近且因物價暴騰而刺激了勞工生活的動盪，更內怠工罷工風潮的一帆風順，工資與物價幾乎比賽增高的速度，以致生產事業又平添一種更新的障礙。我們爲工業前途計，爲勞工生活計，爲國家的整個經濟建設計，都不能不指出整個經濟界的病症現在已經非常嚴重。</p>
<p>二中全會最後一天的會議，通過了宋院長所提加速經濟復員緊急措施辦法，規定勞資糾紛應由政府調解仲裁，不得擅自怠工罷工，如仲裁不能成立，政府得接管該已營企業，至於國營事業的員工視作公務員，更不准罷工。上海市錢市長最近也宣示了處理勞資糾紛四原則：（二）國營事業不得怠工罷工；（二）罷工怠工如未經合法程序應予取締；（三）要求條件如非今日中國生產狀况所能接受，應予拒絕；（四）非法越軌行動應予制裁。可見中央和地方當局都已看到了經濟復員聲中這個妨碍生產的大危機，而想有所補救。我們願再就最近處理工潮事件指出若干可議的地方來，希望當局趕快有合理的糾正，吾則無形中勢將斷傷經濟復員的命脈。</p>
<p>第一，員工薪工，可以生活指數作酌定的參考，使他們的生活得以安定，但不應絕對以生活指數爲依據，使工廠超過負担的能力。目前全國恃薪工爲生的人，除了上海極少數的一部分人外，從沒有絕對依照生活指數領取薪工的。尤其是士兵與公教人員，爲抗戰的有力支柱，但試問他們的所得幾何？即以最近調整加薪而論，底薪一百元者，僅可得六萬五千元，等於戰前的六百五十信，薪級愈高，其倍數亦慈少。士兵生活則更望塵莫及。政府旣握有發行通貨的大權，鈔票儘可隨便添印，更有獨占的營業在掌握中，尙且不敢一律根據生活指數照發員工薪工，何能先强民營事業獨須於一月份發一千八百四十五倍，三月份發二千七百五十四倍。須知員工薪工固宜增加到他們可以安定生活，但同時應顧到一般生產情况，力量能否負担。我們一面固已有生活指數作參考，但試問我國各種農工礦架的生產指數究竟怎樣情形？政府只知力促大家恢復戰前的消費水準，却沒有顧到社會生產能力此時絕沒有恢復戰前的生產水準。（更談不到增加生產），這樣顧前不顯後，勢必要釀成不可收拾的結局。因爲工廠開支加大了，生產不足以副之，除了加高物價茍延殘喘而外，只有「開門大吉！』由前之說，則物價與工資追逐，工資或仍趕不上物價，在員工只是顯到眼前而已；由後之說，則工廠關門，員工失業，更何有照生活指數領取薪工之可言？無論如何，都與工廠及員工雙方不利。</p>
<p>第二，員工的戰前薪工，應各從其本職，而不應有硬性一般的規定。因爲各人職務不同，所領薪工亦不同，旣以生活指數作參考，當各依其本職，參酌比例，擬訂目前的薪工。然後仿照公敎人員待遇辦法，每三個月調整一次。若必勉强把一業的戰前工資，先硬性規定其最低額，而後依此倍乘，則此所謂最低額者實已等於嚮壁虛造。甚且在調査未盡明確之際，隨便決定此戰前薪工，多少是提高了底薪，名爲扶助勞工，實則使工廠增加不合理的額外負擔，終至一旦不勝負擔而關廠，在勞工固反受失業的痛苦，在國家亦將蒙經濟衰落的損害。</p>
<p>第三，同工同酬不應廣泛引用而變爲同業同酬。原來同工同酬一語，乃指男女工人，如做同樣工作，應得同樣酬報，並非指同業的工人必須支取同樣的工資。在工人，工作性質有分類的不同，工作技術有高下的不同，工作年資有久暫的不同，即同在一廠的工人，他們的薪工也斷無完全一律之理。在工廠，則資本有大小，營業有盛寂，同業各廠也只可大體相仿，却不能絲毫無異。假使糊糊塗塗的濫用「同工同酬」的術語，以爲吃某一行的飯，就得拿某一種的薪工，則試問華懋飯店的侍者，是否與老高陞棧一類的茶房，應該領同樣的工資？天下事不外情理，在情理上不可通，而要勉强推行，必致碰壁而後止。等到辦法碰壁之後，工業前途已不堪設想了。</p>
<p>目前，大家正焦盼着經濟復員，更進而至於經濟建設。我們必須牢記，第一總得使工廠可以開門，第二要使員工可以安定，所以應該干萬小心，不可讓無限制的工潮傳染病蔓延開來，弄到員工天天嚷着罷工怠工，工廠天天準備關廠停業。必須認淸這個前提，不走錯路，則國家經濟復員的工作，纔不致受到致命的打擊。</p>

<h3>市商會召集各公會舉行談話會　商應付工業危機　將由商會　具呈政府　對工潮建議五點</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕市商會團呈絨紡織業等公會之要求，特於昨日下午三時，假該會會讓室召集全市各工業公會，舉行談話會。出席各工業公會代表二十餘人，由商會常務理事金潤庠擔任主席。略稱：本日會議</p>
<p>動機有三</p>
<p>（一）市商會以前對工商兩部門，均為滋合紙織，今擬應工業界之　要，另立工業委員會。（二）最近接到社會局之公函，略稱為組織本市各工廠員工消費合作社事，已召開籌備會三次，而第二次籌備會時決議，商會應為該籌備會之當然常務籌備委員，並請本市各工業公會，共推派籌備委員二十人，以便推進籌備事宜。（三）近來工潮澎濟，各工廠首當其衝，應設法覓求合理解決，勿使工潮惡化。纔由商會秘書長嚴鍔擊報告社會局及毛絨紡工業公會來函內容。誕毛絨紡織工業公會。手帕織造工業公會。電機織綢廠業公會等代表，　起發言，對當前工業危機，及各業工潮處理各點，痛切陳詞。駱清華及市黨部委員王先青等，亦先後致詞，對各難題亦多所剖析。談話會討論至入晚七時半，始告一段落。歸納要點，關於</p>
<p>工潮問題</p>
<p>將山市商會具函送呈市府及社會局等，建議五點：（一）各廠工資基數，應以戰前者為標準，再按每月之生活指數計算。（二）在調解勞資糾紛前，應先與資方協談，調查實際情形。（三）請主管當局注意調解時之紀律，例如雙方出席談判時，其代表人數應相等。（四）廠方對本身一切行政事務之處理或規定，勞方不得干涉。（五）處理工潮，應一秉錢市長於三月廿五日所發表之四項原則為準則。此外尚有</p>
<p>零星建議</p>
<p>多則：（一）向四聯總處呈請發放六個月期之低利貸款。（二）呈請軍餮當局，再行公告，罷工怠工須經合法程序，否則將于取締。（三）在市商會下，另組工業委員會之機構，定期招待新聞界，報告工業界當前困難。（四）呈請燃料管理委員會，仿照配給國營工業平價燃料之辦法，同樣優待民營工業。（五）儘量節約進口，以保護國內之工業。（六）改善當前課稅制度，以减輕工業界之生產成本。（七）請各工業公會將各該工業常前困艱危機及生產狀况，備就報告，以便提交各關係方面參考。（八）請市商會逖集各工運團體負責人，懇切商討工業危機，以謀挽救。</p>
<h3>此起彼伏之工潮　第三區機器業　七十餘廠解次　浴業今亦復工</h3>
<p>本市第三區機器業一百五十餘廠之勞資爭資事件，經社會局數度調解，情形好轉，現已有七十餘家復工。該業工會正竭力勸導各廠不友，迅速複工。各廠工友，亦盼早日解決。昨日下午推派代表一百廿餘人，赴社會局請願，期望從速解決，關於工資調整問題，雙方之談判，亦漸趨接近。又浴業上潮尚待調解，但今日決先一律復工。</p>
<p>外國通訊社</p>
<p>本市商通訊社，英國路透社，美國聯合社，及合眾社等華籍職工，昨日發生勞資糾紛。路透社二月份職工底薪原四為十一元六角，惟三月份全部薪金僅四萬五千元。聯合社原允三月份底薪為四十五元，今忽推翻前議，改為二十二元至二十五元。勞方　求維持原薪，按生活指數算給，昨日在全市張貼標語，擴大宣傳，並己其文呈請社會局調解。</p>
<h3>市臨參會第二三次大會　參議員紛提質詢　兩局長分別答復情緒熱烈</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕上海市臨時參議會第二次大會，放昨晨九時一刻開始，同時舉行紀念週。到會廿九人，續到七人，旋由工務局長趙祖康報告工務局工作（報告要點另錄）。在報告中趙局長曾用中英文兩種專門名詞解釋，但永祥雲參議員，則起立要求局長勿用英文。</p>
<p>積水改進</p>
<p>報告完畢後，各參議員即紛紛提出詢問，馮參議員有眞起立謂：本人居住滬西，最近連日下雨，雖積水仍多，但較以往已見改善，對工務局工作努力、値得欽佩。又對該局收取受益費及發行市公債為補充經費亦表同意，但希望有詳細說明。</p>
<p>候雋人謂：蘇州河兩旁及北新涇一帶，時有水患，劉農出捐毀甚重，工務局應趕快採具補救辦法。曹俊提出：工務局工作全部偏重市區，忽略市郊，此後希望兼承。同時修建平民住宅時，應優先救濟受災最深之市民，尤其如大場。　華等飛機塲附近一帶之居民，因彼等之房屋，被敵國築機場，流離失所者，為數至鉅。沈　表示對工務局報告尚嫌不足，請局長將計調詳細說明，不能因經濟困難而敷信過去。</p>
<p>趕造預算</p>
<p>潘序倫貢獻意見：對工務局之工作，須有具體計劃在本屆臨參會提出，分為三年或五年計劃，趕急佔計預算。經本屆參議會決定後，早日實行，水詳雲認為下水道陰講之疏濬，不夠努力。工人待遇，膳宿等問題如何？除西人人名之路名外，希望避免更改，同時應多作宣傳，使人容易記識。此外應放寬馬路，以利行人，建議市府應擴大工務局預算。葉風虎要求急速解決房荒。里弄汚眾溝渠，應趕快修理，以利衛生。徐永祚想起前次詢問北浙江路拆屋問題要求答覆。又工務局工作祇重表面。不切實際，祇修要人所經馬路，而失修兩旁的道路。此外市長報告工務局輕費與局長報告相差三億，何以有此不符？工務局經費佔全市七分之一，實覺太少。傳統先問閘北織絲網圈地數百畝，為何尚未拆除？上海海塘危險，負責修築，賞為當務之急·沈春暉表示，目去年九月至，及本年度之工作計劃，各局都應有應有詳細報告。</p>
<p>局長答復</p>
<p>趙局長當即答覆：（一）都市計劃及工程經費，均已有所籌劃，可供各位參考商討。（二）郊外工程，已盡力進行，但實在限於經費，無從擴展。（三）疏通里　滿渠，須　私人集合設法，局方已推行此項辦法，（四）拓寬浙江路界路，乃欲增闢南北交通，現市民請求緩拆，可請市府當局再行考慮。（五）房荒問題，乃因經費及材料不足。其他問題由書面詳覆，十二時十分散會。主席接到書面提議，謂有參議員數位，反對茶點招待，以資節約。經全體通過取消。</p>
<p>三次大會</p>
<p>下午三時半，繼續舉行三次大會，但最初僅到二十六人，參議員王延松臨時動議，大會出席人數太少，請矛限制。王艮仲動議請各局口頭報告，最多以一小時為限，其書面報告，應在前一天分發，以便晚問詳細閱讀。繼即由公用局局長趙曾玨出席報告，（報告要點另錄）休息十分鐘後，各參議員提出詢問：徐永祚認為路燈依舊太暗，尤其在下雨天行路，不便殊甚。希望趕快恢復到二十六年七月時期情形。又有市民批評敵偽車輛牌照有人包辦，應請查究。傅統先亦有同感葉風虎謂：「四」字頭及「五」字頭電話，最好拆至「一」字及「九」字區，藉以解決該區內用戶之不便。又交通部電訊局通話亦感不便，能否有改進機構及技術辦法？並希望在最短期間內，擴充南北綫公共汽車，對統一公用事業原則亦當有祥細說明。潘序倫發覺局長報告，祇在技術方面，而未及財務及經費預算，電車價格可提高至二百元，這樣也許可增加車輛，以免擁擠。</p>
<p>電話黑市</p>
<p>趙班斧說：交通公司內最缺乏者為輪胎，能否由政府出面，代向美軍當局購買？又聽說普遍裝置電話發現黑市。南市電話尤其不清楚，打二個電話，要汗流浹背！又對大會休息三個鐘點，殊覺太費時間。呂恩滬提出：自來水管不加修理，於是房東限制用水時間，不但引起房客間糾紛且浪費物資。電話名不符實，修理又不盡善，有何計劃辦法，以期改善？</p>
<p>郊外運輸</p>
<p>徐士浩盼望公用局法規，早日加給檢討，美軍用卡車載重過度，有損路面，應予禁止。曹俊要求增加商營公共汽車公司。候雋人顧及郊外鄕民運　疏菜食糧不便，應設法擴充路綫，撥給車輛。</p>
<p>答復各點</p>
<p>趙局長即加以一一答覆，（一）對財務及法規遺漏公布，甚覺抱散，明日當發公用月刊，分期載有各項法規，可與參考。（二）公用局經費自接收至今，領款甚微，而多數費於渡輪及公共汽東方面。（三）調整車價自須按中央規定，不得任意行之。但一方面須顧全市民負担，一方面亦應不使公司虧蝕。接收一百輛之公共汽車，僅能併湊成為五十輛。（四）關於增加車輛問題。估計最短期內英商即將增加二百　十輛，郊區蔬菜運輸，亦已與商營汽車公司初步商洽准予經營。（五）輸胎己請聯合國善後救濟總署設法代辦。（六）牌照包辦事，正竭力查究，苟職員中發覺涉有嫌疑，自當立送警局究辦，並停止職務。（七）電話接綫生不夠，致不易立刻接通，以後機關用綫擬另設交換機。俾內部電話，可不經過外綫。（八）修理水管，決採適當處置辦法。（九）路燈預計明年內，可望逐漸恢復。至六時始告散會。今日上午山衛生局報告，下午教育局報告，三日上午社會局報告，則與四日上午第一次分組審查會對換。</p>
<p>又參祇員朱素　及陸惠民等，前日下午二時在陶爾斐斯路五八三號與本市婦女團體交換意見，商討參議會應提出有關婦女問題，昨晚七時，又假中央西菜社招待本市各報記者發表提案數則。</p>
<h3>春元里房客　請顧</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕南市春元里房客聯合會百餘人，代表全弄房客六百餘人，昨晨八時許集合南昌路一一一號臨時參議會門口請願，原因乃房東欲拆屋强迫遷移。當由參議會負責人應允與有關當局商討，將請願書保留。</p>
<h3>招商局新船　海義輪昨進口　其美號改今晨接收</h3>
<p>（本報訊）招商局由美訂購之新輪，已絡續到滬，海忠輪於上月二十九日抵埠。昨日下午，又有海義輪進口，該項船隻船名，在美即已以華文命名，並懸掛國旗。海忠改名眞美，原定昨晨接收，因手續上關係，改今晨正式接收。船長朱文秉，大副陸樂，輪機長曲公信等，今晨登輪接交，旗幟已懸國旗，故不換旗。接收時談局總經現徐學禹，船務處長黃某等，均將親自到船主持。昨日到滬之海義輪照例應改伸愷號，俟來貨卸清後，完期接收。其餘各新輪已自美首途來滬。</p>
<h3>虬江路舊貨商　私買日僑物品　經憲兵部查獲沒收</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕四川北路虬江路一帶收買舊貨之攤販，鱗次櫛比，獲利優厚。最近有專收舊貨之攤販十餘名，以康價收購日僑各種物件，如木器衣物傢具等項，堆儲於虬江路五百二十二號協記估物商店間壁之空屋內，待價轉售。惟對於日僑物品不准私相買賣，當局早有規定，卒被憲兵獨立第三營查悉，於昨日上午派兵按址馳往查抄，搜出大批日僑傢具，堆儲空屋數間，乃以軍用卡車多輛，將上項物件運往司令部，予以沒收。</p>
<h3>兩局長出席大會報告　建設整個都市為目標　促使公用事業企業化</h3>
<p>上海市臨時參議會昨舉行第二次會議，工務局局長趙祖康出席報告工務情形茲節錄要旨如次：</p>
<p>工務局報告</p>
<p>屬於實施業務者有八，即道路。溝渠。房屋。園場。橋棵。碼頭。河飲。堤塘。而以整個都市建設為其目標。</p>
<p>修疏溝渠河浜，本市共有雨水溝管：長約四十三萬公尺，已疏通者有四分之一。汚水溝管長約十一萬公尺，已通者計三分之一强。已清淞泥二萬四千三百餘立方公尺，故滬西積水較去歲為少，現正計劃拆除棚戶等，以便擴展疏濬河浜工程。</p>
<p>修繕道路橋樓碼頭：本市共有一道路一千公里，應修補路面三十四萬餘平方公尺，現已完成十分之八，行人道己修者，約四萬平方公尺，又新築路面及人行道一部分。橋樑共有二頁二十二座，已修竣者計十座，正在修理者七座。碼頭共三十五座，已修竣者二十四座，正在修理者一座，此外有無需修理，亟待修理，及不能修理者多座。</p>
<p>修建平民住宅：去年冬曾查勘設計擬恢復原有平民村四處，當時預算票款約三億五千萬元，但因經費困難，無法動工，現正洽商中．另計劃新建十二村。</p>
<p>整修南北幹路：以黃浦區為基地，向南北開展，預定閘北通至舊市中心區，南市展至壟華漕涇等處。</p>
<p>設計滬西溝渠及整個都市計劃：分　標治本兩項，治標工作，則為（一）通溝，（二）清浜，（三）加設潮閘與築壩，（四）酌量提高若干段路面。治本工作則為設計與建文，開濬河道，及組　防汛委員會主持之。都市計劃已迭次召技術座談書，　具計劃綱領，呈請市府領導。</p>
<p>全市堤岸：共長十一萬四千公尺，海　對計二十八公里，八年來損毀甚鉅，巳派員詳查擬具計劃，然而費浩大，目前擬異緊急措施辦法，組織工程敵凖備動工。</p>

<p>公用局報告</p>
<p>下午第三次大會時，公用局局長趙會玨出席報告，要旨、如下：</p>

<h3>殺害美飛行員案　被告律師　搜獲新證據　據稱澤田所為可不負責　本案有新發展今晨再審</h3>
<p>被美軍控告殺害美飛行員之日陸軍中將澤田茂等，昨日續受美軍法庭審訊。被告辦論律師波特尼中校與花路上尉，於前數星期親赴東京，搜集辯論證據。據稱，曾親見頁京某學校校長設明，有學生因美機來炸身死，並攜回碎玻璃作證。其後又呈堂上日前陸相夾條，與前日駐華軍司令田焌六之供詞，東條與田焌六均禁獄中，但親書誓言，證明澤田茂無罪。並稱：其一切所為，均由於東京之命令，又稱：澤田茂乃一明智之君子，其一切所為均受東京方面直接指示，故審判美飛行員之事實，與澤田茂無關。被告辯論律師又從東京傳來證人二名，為被告等解罪。據主理該案者稱：該案將有新發展。恐非一時可以了結，定今晨再審。</p>
<h3>歐美習俗　國人爭效　愚人節笑話百出</h3>
<p>按照歐美習俗，昨日為一年一度之愚人節，本市中外人士，方解脫因長期戰爭所遭之災難，逐漸走向充滿希望與幸福之生活，值此佳節，豪興特濃，遂未能免俗。</p>

<h3>重遊滇緬公路舊戰場　一葉皮舟渡怒江</h3>
<p>— 本報二十日順寗航訊　秦寄</p>
<p>自從勝利爆竹一響，大後方的人民，慢慢地能看到上海的報紙，因其紙張潔白，印刷鮮明，看報的人個個稱快。上海只賣卅元一份，到了昆明就賣二百元，到了保山就値四百元一份，求過於供。整大的希望有一個機會，一天就飛到上海去。可是事實常與願望相反，心裏想東去，偏偏會向西走。記者這一次再過怒江，就可說是個想不到的事情。</p>
<p>油管</p>
<p>十日上午九時，兩輛吉普車，離了大理，不到一小時，就過了山明水秀的漾　縣，上大波走了廿公里，下坡到黄璉樹，越過拔海2350公尺的鐵絲鑄，下午二時到達永平縣，休息一小時，繼續出發，再越過拔海2532公尺的麥莊丫口，就此下坡卅公里到瀾滄江，過功過橋，緣江而走廿公里，向西折而至瓦窰，天快黑了，再行五十六公里，即可到保山。沿途看到美軍運輸站及油管站，不下數十處。再講到油管，現在已經破壞了，這世界著名的油管，越過世界著名的駝峯到中國，每卅公里要設一個帮浦站（Pump）。記得一位美軍官吿訴我，一　的汽油從印度運到霑益，値美金五元。照現在的價値來算，値七萬五千元，可見當時汽油的代價。這一個輸油管，除了政府的力量來運用牠出外，商行及私人的力量是絕對不能經營的。關於西南工業和交通，輸油的地方，全靠越南的海防。我們希望海防之成爲自由港，滇越鐵路之共管，能够快快實現，對於西南的繁榮是極有關係的。還有一個消息，有美國四個商行，組織一個公司，將印度的汽油運到緬甸，利用已成的油管輸入滇省。這種消息，我們是非常渴望的，現在滇省的油價已經到廿五萬元一桶。（53嗧）。如果再沒有進油的口岸，西南的交通就要受到大大的威脅。至於油管機器長時擱置，雖然有兵看守，不久也會變成廢鐵，希望當局不要只顧海岸地方的復原，而忘記民族復興的西南各省的繁榮，這是應當特別注意的。</p>
<p>保山</p>
<p>天已經黑了，吉普燈光照在公路上時常能看到兩盞小小紅燈，慢慢地移動，或者穿過公路，向山溝去。大的八時光景，我們到保山。</p>
<p>保山這個地方，相傳是孟獲故居，諸葛亮五擒孟獲處和諸葛營等等的古蹟，還可找到。城內的房屋，已經在戰時毀了十分之七，炸死的人大約二千以上，聽說當時有返國的一批華僑車輛。停在城外炸得更慘，這一筆血債，我們是永不能忘記的。後來，保山變一個反攻的基地，大批軍隊來了，大批美國人也來了，飛機塲築了。飯館戲院也開設了。到了去年春季，保密公路通了，美軍運輸隊，每天數百輛汽車開來，保山是一個膳宿站，至今表現了畸形的繁榮，變成一個臨時的現代都市。</p>
<p>怒江</p>
<p>十二日上午八時，我午繼續出發。自從下關到保山，是二百五十九公里，從保山到匯通橋，是九十公里。翻了一個山頭，下去就是怒江了。怒江，即薩而溫江，冬天的怒江，並不發怒，碧綠的一條水，慢慢地向南流，沙灘襯在綠色的水中，分外明　。我吿訴你，怒江發怒的時候，在雨季，記者前年於九月中由象達回到後方，過江的一個渡口，是「罕拐渡」，前一大晚上下了一夜大雨，淸早起身跑到江邊，在上皮舟，冒險出渡，瞬息數百公尺。江心自上流打下來的牲蓄，草屋，甚至還有屍體，滾滾冲下來，兩岸的距離，因爲水漲血增加了兩倍寬。土黄色的水，照着數千尺高的密林，眞是可惜。在我生命中永遠不會忘記的，即是「風雨皮舟渡怒江」的一天。（强渡怒江之部隊，均乘橡皮船。）匯通橋是滇緬公路的一頂大橋，也是怒江上唯一的橋樑。據說最初有一位商人，他的名字忘記了，他時常往緬做生意，感覺到過）江的不便利，立了一個終身大顧，修了一頂匯通橋。匯通橋上鐵練横空，上舖木板，人馬過橋，搖搖欲動。民國二十九年修滇緬公路，改建了一頂現代化的鐵索橋，上面可以走汽車。卅年日本人打進國境綫，我們將橋樑炸燬，與敵人隔江相持了二年多。一直到前年反攻的時候，在美工兵領導之下建築起來，爲時不過幾十天。旣堅固，又迅速。</p>
<p>嵩山</p>
<p>過了匯通橋，就是上九十公里的上坡了，如果是人走的話，也許走了三天還不到山頂，在上山後四十公里的地方呌做臘猛，有幾間房子，這是半山中的一條街。過了臘猛上去，就是嵩山了。提起了嵩山，也許在大後方的人個個會知道，嵩山的血戰是抗日史上不可磨滅的一頁。士普卡盤旋而上，大家談起嵩山的戰史，我們經過國軍陣亡官兵公墓之前，停車，深深地向他們致敬禮，他們的英靈當與名山同爲不朽。吉普卡盤上最高頂，氣候愈冷，每一個人的心裏也同樣的冷。密集的砲痕，我記得有一天打過尤發的砲彈，現今還看到五六個土人。</p>
<p>龍陵</p>
<p>我們踏着寸土必爭的地方，每一寸土地上我們都見有血跡。自嵩山到龍陵，的有三小時吉普卡的里程。下午三時到了龍陵，龍陵也是敵人死守的地方，整個縣城被毁滅。現在的一條街，全部房屋都是新造的。</p>
<p>芒市</p>
<p>過南天鬥，看見桐菓園。下去就是芒市　子了。芒市的氣候特別溫暖，竹子是終年常綠的，大榕樹漲得高大，樹下面可以居住。進到芒市是緬滇風光了，居民多數是白夾，服裝言語和我們不同，生活習慣也和我們不同。他們的土司年紀很小，有一個代辦姓方名克光，年紀的四十多歲，人家呼之爲三代辦。日本人來時，據說他是做俘虜，日本人退走，他是逃回來的。但是據現在外面的四代辦說，方克光是跟敵人常漢奸的，不知究竟誰是通敵，誰是愛國，總之敵人來大家通敵，敵人去了，大家愛國而已。土司的衙門裕豐園，從前是敵人的司令部，現在是駐軍的團部。園中經整理後花木茂盛，山茶花，美人蕉，都開着，中午的時光，穿一件羊毛衫，還覺得熱，可見芒市的氣候特異。</p>
<p>方代辨吿訴我：現在有十二個中正小學，並且有相當的經費，他準備二萬籮殼辦一個中正小學，敎員的待遇每年四百鋼洋，合國幣四十萬元，我曾到新街上去參觀他們的中正小學，有簡單的房屋幾座，棹椅板橙還算整齊，敎員是漢人，課程中沒有夷文，我希望有一點種白夷文，白夷文是向夷和尙讓的文字，這種文字並不够用，我又聽到方代　說，在抗戰前辦學校，白夷不願來，每家出錢　一個孩子來讀書，日從日本人來了以後，白夷受到敵人種種的蹂躪，中國最後打了勝仗，現在家家自願來求學。現在，我們要保持白夾的白夷文，並且希望他受同等的敎育，同我們漢人在法律上同享平等的權利，而盡同等的義務，不像日本人追着白夷充砲灰。</p>
<p>方代辦有一個兒子，今年十六歲，曾經到過緬滇華僑中學讀一年書。穿着西裝，生得淸秀，和我們的蘇州少爺不多。我勸他快上昆明去讀書，不要在家裏躭誤靑春。</p>
<p>騰衝</p>
<p>從芒市折向能陵，有一條向西北支路，大約八十公里，可以直達騰衝。「騰衝」是邊疆名城。我們當小學生的時候就知道，是我們極西南的一個重鎭，中英條約開過商埠，可是有領事館而沒有英國人來，現在騰衝城是一座空城。三十三年反攻之役，騰衝城血戰四十夕，才將敵人全部殲滅。騰衝在敵八工事最堅强，而我們攻克他也最早。有人說是霍總司令的福氣大，的確霍總司令生得天官式的貌相，誰都承認他是一個國家的福將。在騰衝城外牛里路的地方，來鳳山麓一個小包包上葬了五千多人的骨灰，這是國場公園，也就是反攻騰衝的陣亡將士的公墓，墓前紀念堂階墓前面，有「碧血千秋」四個大字，下款寫着「蔣中正題，雲貴監察使李根源書」。我們走進國殤公園，看見這四個大字，想到題的人，寫的人，葬的人，不覺肅然起敬。離紀念堂百公尺之地，有一個小小墳墓，上寫「倭塚」兩個大字。聽說裏面葬有三百多敵人的骨灰，今日對着烈士墓前水久的站着，這些孤魂野鬼死而有靈，不知有什麽感想。墓上有霍總司令的紀念碑，略云：</p>
<p>騰衝城垣堅厚，河流環繞，鎖渝邊陲，素構險固。倭寇　層兩年，密集守備，清穴隧道縱横，交通砲壘槍業。星羅棋佈，我軍於八月二日趁空軍之轟炸，奮勇登城前仆後繼，勢如潮湧，盡毁城上堡壘，三面進人市區，兇悍之敵，猶復負隅困鬥，憑籍堅强之工事，與街市之房屋，步步爭持，處處激戰，硝烟敝日，彈雨連天，肉搏血飛，歷四十餘晝夜，至九月十日將敵完全殲滅。……我官兵本革命無畏之精神，受領袖感德所感召，忍飢耐寒，冒險犯難，出死入生，有進無退，十盪十決，再接再厲，卒能摧堅陷說，掃穴殲渠，發揚國威，轉捩戰局，除國際交通之障碍，開反攻勝利之先聲，虜廷作慘敗之哀鳴，盟友有英勇之讚譽。凡此光榮之戰果，實爲革命之奇葩。</p>
<p>戰事太偉大了，我們反攻緬滇路，不是一件容易的事，有人說我們八年來沒有打過敵人，不知這些先生們到了騰衝去看了，會有什麽新感想。與騰衝齊名的是李根源先生，他是騰衝人，想不到在極還的騰衝地方出此偉大人物，今年六十七歲，布袍布掛，精神非常好，身體也十分康健。記者同他談話頗引以爲榮幸。這是他的談話斷片：人家以爲我有八九十歲，其實我只有六十多歲。綜計我的一生，八年在日本，十六年在蘇州，抗戰八年到大後方來，民闕初年我在雲南省當第二師師長，只有三十威，在日本利總理一起首次開同盟會。現在活的只有六個人。爲了革命，居覺生曾經逃難到我家裏，我父親招待他兩次。我從小就好革命，爲了反對學老師加錢，我還在永昌府坐幾天板房哩。陳作民這個漢奸，我在蘇州時對顧墨之說過：早該殺的。李先生說到殺字，眉宇間還存少年剛銳之氣，因爲先生常師長時在大理殺幾，百人載入誌書。記者又問：印公何日返蘇州？啊！今年四月吧！記者約印公今年四月在蘇州相會，這是我國之元老，一代政治家。</p>
<p>與李印公齊名的是金廷臣先生，今年已經九十七歲了，能吃，能走，能和常人一樣生活，家裏子孫滿堂，還要料理家務，當敵人佔據騰衝的時候，老先生到昆明去。騰衝克服了，就回來，依這位先生的康健，活到一百歲，是不成問題的，記者有一次和他談話，問他長壽的秘訣，他說：一天吃四餐，三十歲後就不近女色，這證明他的先天生得厚，後天保養得好，這是長壽的秘訣。</p>
<p>短短的十天，完成我的再過怒江紀錄，寫此以吿上海的老鄕們。</p>
<p>銅岡說明：（上）遼寧兵工廠之一部。（下）蘇軍搬走遼寧兵工廠機破時，嫌其門口太小，無法搬運，乃將門戶開大。</p>
<h3>難民數十萬在鎮江</h3>
<p>— 本報廿九日鎮江訊　陶匋寄</p>
<p>目前集中在鎭江的難民，約有數十萬，這一個龐大的數字，是從蘇北旅鎭各縣同鄕會調査得來的。在鎭的難民，可以包括下列幾縣：高郵·寳應·興化·淮城·淮陰·以及漣水·泗陽，以至於豐·沛·蕭·碭·他如鹽城·皁寗·東台·及揚州·泰州·通州·徐州·海州·這五大州，也集中一郃份，然而總不及鎭江多。</p>
<p>難已成羣　絡繹於途</p>
<p>現在這還不能算是一個止數，因爲陸續成羣而來的，尙在不絕於途。他們爲甚麽這樣的望外在奔，當然是有一種非跑不得已的苦衷，那一個人不明白「在家千般好，出外一時難」？而况出來並不是即有辦法，就有救濟，在這種情况之下，固然有一種是自動的，和另一種是被動的。（指怕抽丁）而道兩種比較起來，數字正是一個平衡。然而在事實上，屬於後者倒反而好有辦法，因爲均是來自田間，粗事勞工，都能够做到，決不像前者儘是一些知識份子，旣不好脫却長衫，又不能肩挑貿易，眞是‘無一用是書生。</p>
<p>朝求張良　暮拜韓信</p>
<p>大早起來，先是忙着購買大餅，到了中午和夜晚，再忙着怎樣去吃飯，小吃食館子，到了這個時候宣吿客滿。可憐昔日養尊處優之輩，到今日則與販夫走卒同餐共桌。至於住的問題，祗要是有一些關係，便硬行的住了下來，因爲是旅社住不起，更有一些舉目無親的難民，便合伙兒起來「宿廟」，雖然亦需付以租金，但是比之於租賃住房，那總是合算一些。空閒的時候，除了在街坊徜徉而外，便是忙着寫信，或者塡寫履歷表，「求張良，拜韓信」，想謀一枝之棲。在這種情况之下，是不折不扣的同病相憐，正也不知有多少可歌可泣之事。而他午最怕的一件大事，便是生恐一旦害病，然而天老爺也好像是在滑路上趕人，入春以來，差不多全是陰雨天。而且一雨便是三朝和五日，每每爲了一頓飯，淋成落湯鷄的模樣回來。內憂外攻，身非鐵石，能不面容憔悴者，眞是鮮有其人。他們這受着這樣的痛苦，和這樣非人類的生活，不會就乾脆的回去嗎？</p>
<p>三資鬥爭　鬥光為止</p>
<p>故鄕是一種甚麼情况呢？據來人談起來說是相互尋釁，進行三資鬥爭。</p>
<p>甚么呌三資？第一個是「資產」祇要有資產，便是被鬥的對象，一直到鬥光為止。第一個是「資望」祇要是略具聲響，便也有被鬥的資格。第一個是「資歷」，大約是指過去服務方面而言，這也是其中之一。像這三種的當事人，似使是都逃亡外出，即以其家屬爲對象，鬥爭之所得，以二成給鬥爭者，其餘的沒收歸公，逃亡出之家屬悉數貫入逃籍，予以一徉驅逐，並沒收其財產，在暗中更煽動民衆，相互尋釁，更派有鬥爭委員，分發各縣，次第實施，實行其一家哭何如一路哭之慘劇。家鄕環境如此，所以那一個人敢言「歸去來兮」，祗有抱定主意，到那兒再說那兒話。可是坐吃山要空，更何况連山也沒有呢？</p>
<p>鐵的事實　血的文件</p>
<p>蘇北各縣旅鎭同鄕會，鑒於長此以往，前途非常之嚴重，昨特聯合呼籲寫成血漬斑斑的文字，分呈中央省府及善後救濟總署蘇寗分署，請求設法救濟，原呈云：査善後救濟總署蘇寗分署救濟工作綱要，以老弱殘廢爲標準，今後救濟辦法，本此施行，竊以此項標準，在軍令統一政令統一之地區，而循此經常不易之法，誠屬盡善盡美，環顧蘇北今日之局勢，其實際究爲何如耶？蘇北各縣，奸匪久佔，據爲巢穴，軍權在握，完全寇　動態，政治獨立，造戍割據局面，尤其對於地主士紳，知識份子，靑年男女等人，竭力網羅，必欲吸收無餘，與其同化而甘心，誘惑之不入，繼之以威脅，威脅之不濟，加之以封鎖，封鎖之不及，臨之以刑戮。</p>
<p>當削爭務　救濟流亡</p>
<p>可　蘇北　　，陷於水深火熱之中，無法擺脫。甘願拋家失業，相率逃亡，父母兄弟，妻子離散，各不相顧，常其出亡之時，二肩明月，多半深夜潛逃，兩袖清風，不少裏腹跋踄，非無田產，背負不能，雖有僞幣，易地不用，况其出亡之後，家鄕隔絕，無法接濟，甫離天羅地網，又値露宿風餐，其飽嘗非人生活之慘痛，實與老弱殘廢者不相上下。而其痛恨奸匪之決心，與信仰政府之熱忱，則又過之。是故以氣　論，以艱苦論，以危急論，救濟此項流亡難民，實爲當務之念。譬之人家子弟，因其愛　父兄，致遭意外之禍災，其父兄哀矜憐惜之心，自必勃發而不可遏，此人事之常情也。目前流亡難民所處之境地，與子弟同，政府所處之地位，與父兄同。念彼難民，本爲氣節而來，無論救濟與否，尙復何怨何允？特恐處此艱苦危急之境，國家復員之初，若不續予救濟，則難民之生死所繫，即羣情向背有關，我賢明仁慈政府長官定能鑒察及此，不罪情詞之迫切也。代表等責任義務，俱無可辭，旣有所知，不敢不言，旣有所言，不敢不盡，爲此聯合其呈，代陳苦情，仰祈鑒核俯准，對於蘇北各縣避匪流亡難民，列爲救濟重要對象，陸續救濟，培養國運，安定民心，實利賴之。</p>
<p>六項請求　冀獲解次</p>
<p>除了這篇呈文而外，還有六點請求，按照規定補發。一，請求將蘇北各縣實際情形，申報善後救濟總署，轉向聯盟國說明變更旣定救濟綱要，側重當前蘇北難民急用。二，請求每月規定發給難民麵粉一定數量。三，請求發給衣服，四，請求在鎭江·揚州·泰州·通州·徐州·海州·廣設臨時診所，普遍診治難民。五，各縣繼續流亡難民，在冬令救濟結束後，請求繼績辦理春令急賑，以資救濟。六，請求在冬賑期內原定三月，照規定每人大口應得麵粉三袋，小口應得袋半，實際第一期大口僅得十四斤，小口僅領得七斤，第二期大口領得二十八斤，小口領得十四斤，合計大口僅得四十二斤，不足一袋，小口領得二十斤，不足半袋。按照原定數，僅得三分之一，不足及剩餘麵粉，請應仍按原規定補發。</p>
<h3>參政會十五次會通過　對教育報告次議</h3>
<p>參政會卅日第十五次會凝時，通過對於敎育報吿之決議，原文如下：</p>
<p>本會同人，讀此次敎育部工作報吿，於國民敎育則建立第二次五年計劃，期於確能普及於中等敎育，則比例設置中學師範及職業學校，期於均衡發展，於高等敎育則注意於專科以上學校之地域分布，期無偏於一隅，具見敎育當局籌劃之苦心。茲敬以同人讀後所見，臚陳如下：</p>
<p>（甲）國已教育</p>
<p>（一）普及國民敎育，非一蹴可幾，學齡兒童，父兄未有不願子弟入學者，然赤貧之家，則童年亦需做工，方能維持其衣食，武訓是其顯例。將來應至少保留現有公費一百零六億之預算，並遵照國父地方自治開始施行法，對於赤貧學生，供給其書籍膳食衣服等費，俾五年中普及國民敎育之計劃，確能實現，此事當早日籌謀。</p>
<p>（二）小學敎員之待遇，報告書中謂「經於修訂國民學校敎職員任用待遇保障進修辦法時規定，應以當地個人衣食住三者所需生活費之三倍爲標準。」誠能如此，必可使其安心敎學，然據同人所知，敎職員今日能維持其本身之最低生活者，爲數甚少，遑論三倍，希雜能早日補救，庶三倍之數不致成爲空懸之目標。</p>
<p>（三）現在敎科書係屬國定，不容外間編輯，其所編者亦未比商家前經審定之本爲善，而供應允感遲緩，以致全國兒童陷入無書可讀之境，應即廢止此辦法。惟各書肆暫時印行戰前菜經審定之敎科書以後，仍許其公開競爭，由部審定，以求妥善。</p>
<p>（四）現在教科書由七大書肆承印，在交通便利之區，固無不可，而偏僻省份，七大書肆或無分店，亦或爲其發行網所不及，同人認爲應行開放，俾敎廳書肆並可翻印。</p>
<p>（五）民衆敎育館，成人補充敎育等，應發動已衆之力量，又推進之，如再用官吏提倡，保甲包辦之法，必無實效，應請敎部另擬新辦法。</p>
<p>（乙）中等教育</p>
<p>（一）據敎部最近統計，全國共有中學七六九校學生八〇二一六三人，師範四九八校學生一三〇九九五人，師範校生數巨，遠較中學爲少，而報吿中，則稱期於五年內增加師範生五十萬人，誠恐難於實現，似宜再在中學儘量添設師範科，以期確能供給國民敎育師資之需要。</p>
<p>（二）經敵僞及他種軍隊之摧殘，各巾等學校之圖書儀器，大半　然無存。爲救濟計，應令各校暫時就近通用借用他校設備，並宜嚴訂借用時損壞賠償之辦法，以杜流弊，並擇一摧殘較少之學校，作供給之中心。至於省會所在地，普遍遍設立科學試騐館，以便施敎，將來物資充裕，再圖發展。</p>
<p>（三）職業學校之設備，最關重要，國家應盡量使之充實，並切實與工廠取得聯緊以便隨時實習。</p>
<p>（四）現在靑年失學之嚴重性不减於抗戰時期，爲救濟中等學生計，惟有多予公費，俾流亡學子咸有安插，而敎部規定招致失學靑年名額過少，聞僅有兩萬餘名，按之實際，有一省逃亡之失學靑年，達一萬餘人者，故該項名額亟應擴大。</p>
<p>（五）國內經濟狀况穩定後除師範生及職業學校學生例給公費外，中學可改設獎學金名額以選拔家境貧寒無力升學之優秀學生。</p>
<p>（丙）高等教育</p>
<p>（一）科學研究，爲民生與國防之所繫。近年來科學進展，入於原子能之新世紀，尤屬驚人，我國對於科學研究，如不迅謀有效之推進方法，必無以應付此新時代之要求，永爲世界之洛伍國家。目前各科學先進國家，每年用於硏究科學之經費，其數額達國家預算總額百分之一。必須有此充裕之經費，然後可望有理想之成就，而我國現時各大學及研究院所，財力均極艱窘，遂使人才設備，兩感缺乏，陷於有名無實之境，應謂教育當局向中樞痛切陳詞，請求指撥國幣一百億，爲本年度科學復員及發展經費，以後逐年增加，期達國家預算總額百分之一。（中央社重慶卅一日電，續稿待刋。）</p>

<p>紹興在外地人的印象中，倒不是他曾經做過越王的故都，或文人義士的故鄕，而是「紹典酒」「紹興戲」和「紹興師爺」一連串熟悉的名詞，在小市民階層流傳着。但知識階級則有另外一種感覺，他們從史地常識上知道山陰，會稽，越王，魯迅……一類更高級的名詞，而在地理上，它更握有杭甬鐵路的要衝。</p>
<p>臭水溝　垃圾堆</p>
<p>紹興，在我們的想像中，是一個現代　鹿的江南都市。然而，想像和現實往往隔着一段很遼遠的距離。到紹興以後，給我第一個印象是：船在臭水溝行進，兩岸無門的廁所，很公開地在上面陳列垃圾堆像小山一樣在路旁矗立。除了一兩條外表稍微像樣的馬路以外，其餘都是臭水溝和垃圾堆一樣齷齪而骯髒的房屋與街道。另一個印象，則是大街小巷都有着面黄肌瘦的窮苦孩子，伸出可怕的手，向你求乞，也有不能生活的老太婆，在凜冽的朔風中，發出飢寒的慘狀。</p>
<p>越王臺　破瓦礫</p>
<p>越王台可鳥瞰全城和郊上的景物。城裏的房子都是些不規則的建築，郊外綜錯的河流，縱横的阡陌，起伏的邱陵，交錯的湖泊，迤長的村莊，靑葱的景色給這江南的郊原，披上了一件絢爛的新裝。</p>
<p>緊接着越王台的山坡下，還遺留着一片遠年的頹坦瓦礫，雖然沒有任何標識可以說明這是越王的故宮，然而我們從高聳的城碟，宏偉的屋基，可以斷定這曾經是勾錢嘗胆的所在。我們對這一個生聚敎訓復仇雪恥的人物，不禁起了無限的崇敬。</p>
<p>風雨亭　憶女俠</p>
<p>和越王台對峙的山坡，有一個曾進破壞的六角亭。</p>
<p>我們從上面的聯句：「碧血廿年，還我河山思往事」；「孤亭一角，愁人風雨寄吟魂！」斷定這是爲紀念秋瑛而建立的風雨亭。而秋瑾女俠的紀念碑，則在城內軒亭口。據說這是一代女傑紀元前五年六月五日就義的地方，回怨革命締造的艱辛，我們對建國工作，怎可不賣一點力？</p>
<p>魯訊鎭　豎空牌</p>
<p>魯迅之家，在紹興着好奇，也曾作過一次訪問。據說現在已經是地方法院了。在「三味書屋」徘徊了很久，想不到一代文豪，在他的故鄕找不到一點可資紀念的柬西，雖然也有一個空牌的魯迅鎭，然而那是多麼的空虛呵！</p>
<p>紹興酒　地方戲</p>
<p>紹興酒為什么享有盛名，據當地的朋友說：那是因爲山陰河里的水分量蠶味淳的緣故，紹興的釀酒工人，到別處就釀不成這樣的洒了。不信還可以把山陰和會稽的水拿來比較，可惜沒有工夫作這樣一種試騐。</p>
<p>紹興城里的幾家戲班子，似乎還沒有外地紹劇的角色來得齊全，舞台的古舊和設備的簡陋，幾乎使我們不相信這就是現代都市的娛樂塲所。</p>
<p>八卦城　文人多</p>
<p>至於紹興師爺，那更是過去了的產物，然而不可否認，紹興人才，特別是文人之多，簡直難以計算，據說這也是因爲紹興是八卦城的關係，這自然近於迷信而不足爲信。</p>
<p>使人發生極大感慨的，就是：人家的國度製造原子，而紹興大多數的居民，還在打着錫箔。</p>
<p>紹興城現在有六個鎭。鎭上的名稱，都冠以近代名人如湯公，成章，錫麟，秋瑾，元培，魯迅。據說人口有二十五萬，但這里面有不少的阿Q，老拴，潤土，孔乙己，華大媽，祥林嫂，單四嫂子之類窮苦絕望的人物，追求光明，渴望幸福，我謹以最誠摯的心情，向他們祝福！</p>

<h3>談名鎖利韁</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>我國過去有一些目淡泊不慕榮利的女士，拿「名鎖利韁」來形容名利對於一個人的牢籠和　　，要我們擺脫名與利約束縛。</p>
<p>爭名貪利無論對於社會和個人都是很不好。一味追求名望的人，有時只知唯名是趨，　虛榮而不求實際，好浮飭　而忽視事功。至於因爭名而傾軋他人，因爭名而剝奪他人的利益，那更不行了。社會上有不少慕虛名的人，不從自己實際的工作上努力，只知終日奔走於權貴之家，出入於顯達之門，鎮營惟恐後人，謀路惟恐不周。這樣的人不但於社會有害無益，努對他個人也是徒耗精力而無所獲的。因為名與實本是相聯的，丟開實際的工作表現，就算自己認為已獲得相當的社會地位，也只能說是虛名，不是真實的名譽。傎正的名譽，非勉強求得，沽名釣譽所得的名譽，不是名譽，反是恥辱。柏拉圖說過：「不是我們應得的名譽，接受了反而玷污了自己的人格」。那些驚名若狂而不求實際的人，自以為在求名譽，實則自己先毀了名譽！</p>
<p>至於利，那更是人人所好的。社會上正不知有多少人因貪利而釀成爭端，不能個人與個人之間的　　給這個「利」字摧毀了，而且整個的社會弄得紊亂不堪，使大家無法安定生活。投機　積之風一日不戰，則這會秩序一天不能安定，國民道德一天不能提振。自私心理的產生，實源根於「自利」，因為自利，當然不　人家的利益，當然不取正當的獲利方法，一意囤積居奇，你欺壓我，我欺壓你，我有貨在手，便可贏得過你，我有錢在手，我便是活財神，管他天大的事不問。這樣我剝削你，你剝削我，誰有貨誰贏，誰有錢誰有辦法，傎是孟子所說的「上下交爭利，而國危矣」！</p>
<p>求名與求利　上去是兩件事，實則兩者之間也有　聯繫關係，統榨求名或純粹求利事實上是很少的。求名原就帶有求利的目的，本來求名應該做到「名至實歸」，而一般人則希冀「名至實歸」。甚至有人把「名至實歸」的意義誤解了，以為「實歸」云　，即是獲利之另一說法。更有許多人們求名視為求利的一種手段，以為既有了名，那有無利可圖之理？當然，還有一些人　　於利，輔銖必較，抱定既求得了利，名必隨之而來。大約是由於高官厚錄，可　相當的代價而得，而且在那些「唯金錢主義者」的心目中，以為錢能通神，錢能操縱一切，支配一切，邊論一個人的名？但是他們何當想到傎正的名譽，是自己的學術人格，思想，經騐等精神的財產不假　求而獲致的。不經過艱苦的勞力，（體力的或智力的），就算自己已經認為達到所謂「名利雙輝」的目的，至多取人信仰於一時，終究還是要失敗的。何況虛名並不能聚焦於人，不由自己勞力而獲的利，更不能逃避盜　之名。利必須取之以養，這是一定的道理，不義之財的獲得，實在和盜　沒有兩樣，人格上所損失的，在　上所損失的，達過於所獲的不義之財以上。</p>
<p>淡於名與利　泊的高士們，他們看穿了免得的牢籠人，（也可以說是人自牢籠，便　「名鎖利韁」來暗示人不要披他們牽絆，以至喪失灭性，惹起除不盡的煩惱。他們的見解自然是很對的。我們對於名利如果能認識得清楚，當然不致被混濁的「　世」所迷蒙。但是，要一個人完全丟　免得的觀念也許並不可能。我　傎能不為名鎖利韁所　縛的人，世間實在很少。即是在過去，人類的生活　　很　單，不必你爭我奪，然而傎能視寶貴如浮雲的能有幾個。　板橋所企　的漁家生活，要我們也跟着學，除非時代倒轉過去在物賞文明的現代社會中，我們根本不能也不必企義過去所謂「高士」「隱者」的生活，但同時我們也不能不追求合理的精神生活，讓心靈有一個安慰的所在，不必學樵夫漁者，更不必羨　那般古代的高士隱者之流，只要對名與利有一番新的認識就夠了。</p>
<p>照心理學家的研究，人類從出生以來，就有一種滿足欲望的需要。有些學者說，欲望為人類的本能，是與生俱來的。這點且不去管他，但人類的欲望和需求隨生長與發展的程度而增多總是事實，所處的社會環境愈復雜，則對於生活的欲望和需求也愈增多。無論如何我們不能離開社會而生活，就是生活在孤島上的人，也總有他們的欲望利需求的。最低限度的生活不能維持，最低限度的物質欲望不能滿足，你就無法敎人甘於淡泊。　目下物價如此之高，一般人的生活艱難到萬分，要找像陶淵明那樣過恬淡間適的「採菊東籬下」的生活簡直談不到，貴村經濟破達了，社會組織動搖了，任憑你怎樣愛好農村的生活，也不容　你的心有一天的安定。主要的是由於古代的農業社會和現代的農業社會在本質上發生了變選。至於要找像陶淵明那樣「不為五斗米折腰」的縣官　，更是不可能了。</p>
<p>我們不必勉強去擺脫名利，只須把名與利的觀念導入合理的適當的途徑。就談名吧，好名，求名都不能算是壞事，只在求之當與不當。古人說：「三代之下惟恐不好名」。林肯也說過：「傎能好名的人，一定能愛名，也一定不肯輕易玷污自己的名」。可見傎能好名的人到選是有志氣的。就憑他們的好名，便能表現出他們的自愛和自重，不甘流於庸俗。利用人類好名的本能，又可以激發一個人的志向，　勵一個人的上進。不過有一點却要認清：好名是追求應得的榮譽，不是徒　虛名可比。愛榮譽的人，他們的生活理想一定很　高，很偉大，對於「人格」兩個字更看得很　。外界的稱許，困係實至名歸，當然安心接受，但絕不願聽流俗的恭維和諛慕。除非學術上或事業上有值得人推崇的地方，決不以稱得虛名而沾沾自喜。　這樣的愛名的人，必定能自尊，同時也能尊人。如此愛名，榮譽不求而自得，於個人於社會可說團得其益，傎是夠得上澈底明　名的意義了。</p>
<p>再來談利。求利也不是一件壞事，當得之利是心智體力勞動的代價，是我們做人應享受的權利，我們如果一味的漠說利，不但我們不能獲得生活的資料，也無異放棄自己應享受的權利。不能享受權利，就不能當義務。利可以使人習於自私，甚至因他毀掉名譽和人格，或致　身。利也可以使人獲得物質和精神上的安慰，改善自己的生活並利益人眾社會，全　如何的去求利。正如求名一樣，我們不能苟得，必須取之以正當的手段，辨別利與義的傎　，以「義」做求利的前提，用多少力得多少利，絲毫不存懷倖心，貪得心，那便不致敗壞的人格。對學術和事業的成就，不能自滿，而於個人所得的利，却要知足，當然我們也要能維持最限低度的生活。</p>

<h3>勞資合股</h3>
<p>— 楊希堯</p>
<p>近數月間，本市物價直線上升，引起了嚴重普遍的工潮，一波未平，一波又起，幾乎無工不意，勞資雙方各走極端，整個社會頓受動蕩。雖經社會當局極力從中調解，逐步解決，漸趨平靜，但是目前物價仍難穩定，所以對未來之勞資糾紛，殊難過分樂觀。譬如說，這次勞方的工資已經加到照目前的物價可以維持生活的數字了，自然各安其樂。然而物價倘繼續上漲，經過若干時日，是不是要再請求加　呢？這樣下去，真是令人不敢設想。</p>
<p>筆者以為要根本解決工潮，莫若將給薪制，改為資方以資本為股份，勞方以勞力為股份。簡單的說，一方錢股，一方人股，將盈餘的利潤，各依應得之比例分配。這樣物價上漲，彼此得的利潤多，當然受不到影響。一且物價下跌，大家的利潤也得了不少。可是物價下跌，消費自然而然的也少了，還是受不到影響。而且這樣一來，勞方因利益切身，自必忠於職務。勞方忠心服務，業務自然發達。業務日臻發達，對資方自然也有利。這更可促成勞資合作。</p>
<p>至於勞資雙方怎樣合作，怎樣配合條件，怎樣分配利潤，則必須雙方自行商討。</p>
<p>筆者既無經濟學識，又無工商經難，所達當然是片面的理想。未知這種環想是否是合理？希望專家討論，且待事實證明。</p>
<h3>浦東出會</h3>
<p>— 厲生</p>
<p>浦東仍有不少迷信的民衆，除了去年因為東昌路高廟等處甩炸彈而暫停外，今年春天又在籌備襄會了。雖然當地分局曾出求布告，但怎能禁得信這般愚民呢？</p>
<p>迎　賽會雖說是敬神，但大部份都是流氓們，好勇鬥狠，百把斤香爐鉤在胳臂上，跑上幾里路，（結果殞命的很多）。更有淫詞　　，什麼十八摸啊！打　花啊！如此種種；難道　　亦愛這些調調兒嗎？</p>
<p>出會種田的農人便晦氣，良好的麥苗，給　會的人　成枯草。　會使幾千幾萬的男女老少丟了應做的工作，　藹上幾天。</p>
<p>出會時除了照照施主們牌頭的和尚道士，以及要出風頭的毛頭夥子外，其他人士，實一無沾惠！</p>
<p>我希望市政當局，切實　　下令，　予禁止！否則一方面既更助長迷信，另一方面，八年遭殃民困未　，若一出會，耗費之金錢更不在少數，對於復興地方不無阻碍！且出會時人擠，踏　兒童，扒手　盜，爭風調笑等，不一而足，對於治安亦有妨碍。</p>
<h3>真空抽血器</h3>
<p>— 沈時</p>
<p>當醫生需要從病人的血管中抽取血液來作實騐診斷的時候，是用普通靜脈注射器來抽血的。</p>
<p>最近有一種新式的傎空抽血器，形式和我們所見的注射器相仿，一頭駿有變孔的針頭，而在手動　　的一面，換了一個橡皮　的吸頭，內曾裝有一個能自動對　的傎空的儲血管。</p>
<p>這一種傎空抽血器能在一秒鐘內抽取血液一西西，較普通的快幾倍。當抽血完畢的時候，因能自動閉封，所以沒有將血液潑出和傳染雜菌的危險，而且不需加任何抗凝血性藥物，因此抽血的手續較現在的靜脈注射器簡便安全得多了。</p>
<h3>同情</h3>
<p>— 小山</p>
<p>人與人之間，永遠是相互的，不止是外面的「互助」，更是表面的「同情」。</p>
<p>有人以為互助是積極的，同情是消極的，其實不然。慣於助人的，不見得他是同情於人的，倒是可能是「背情」的。因為沒有真實的同情心，才使今天許多互助的事落到虛偽和欺騙中。</p>
<p>人與人，可以有許多外面的不同—地位，敎育，生活，年齡，種族，甚至嗜好和興趣，可以這些都是立體；但裏面的應該彼此拉成平面，彼此的心應該是隨時都能溶化在一起的。但今天的情形，似乎裏面的封鎖，更甚於外面的縣殊，每一個人的心門幾乎都是關　緊緊地，甚至有人把「保持一種相當的疏遠」當作新的　世學！</p>
<p>我們分拆心門關閉的原因，並不由於外面那些縣殊關係，只不過因着人們為了某一種的恐懼，驕傲，懷疑，或是僅是純粹的懶惰，就把天賦的同情心丟了。</p>
<p>解鈴仍須系鈴人，為什麼不拾起這把寶貴的鑰匙，打開封鎖的心門呢！</p>
<p>「同情」並非「憐憫」之謂。見了一個頻於死亡線的乞者，誰都會慈悲地歎上一口氣。這不夠「同情」，反之，這可能是「驕矜」！同情乃是在你同別人的關係裏，把你自己和你的傎實的情感注進去一點！它是含有一種說不出來的適宜，溫暖，和可愛的未兒的。</p>
<p>同情是自己站在別人的現實裏，了解他的情緒，與志　，而使他感到一種實際的「新鮮」，一如他自己所長發的血液一樣。</p>
<p>同情不能單用　語和姿態來實現，而是把自己毫無保留地交給人家—　　地交給，不是冰冷一片的。</p>
<p>「同情人的必得同情」！許多同情的果子，使自己更感到湧溢的「活力」！因為當別人的心門給你打開時，那個「傎情」的流露，永遠是互相分受的。</p>
<p>如果人類能學習裏面的同情，就許多形式的「互助條約」不致習慣性地被粉碎無存了。</p>
<h3>不反光的眼鏡</h3>
<p>— 吳大權</p>
<p>戴眼鏡的人，都感覺至鏡片有時有反光看不清楚的毛病。最近已有補救辦法。就是在鏡片上塗上一層化學質的薄膜。這薄膜雖然不能阻止反光，但有使反光相互抵銷的效力。照相機的鏡頭塗上道一層薄膜，即使向陽直拍，也不致底片模糊。</p>

<h3>Chairman Chiang's Political Address at the People's Political Council: Elaborating on the Government's Post-War Measures and Emphasizing the Importance of Sino-Soviet Cooperation</h3>
<p>[Chongqing, Central News Agency, 1st] The People's Political Council held its 18th meeting on the morning of the 1st. Chairman Chiang personally attended at 11:15 AM, stepping onto the podium amidst enthusiastic applause from the entire body, to deliver an address reporting on the government's important measures after the end of the war of resistance. He explained in detail the government's policies and handling of (1) the Northeast problem, (2) the Yining problem, and (3) the draft constitution problem. The Chairman first apologized to the Council members for his inability to attend meetings regularly and discuss matters with them over the past two weeks. He then stated that the government's important measures and goals in the six months since the end of the war of resistance have been to strive for domestic peace and stability, and to jointly seek world peace and security. After recounting important measures such as the convening of the Political Consultative Conference, the establishment of the Military Mediation Executive Headquarters, and the formulation of a basic plan for reorganizing the armed forces, the Chairman explained the government's policies and handling of the Northeast problem, the Yining problem, and the draft constitution problem respectively, speaking for one hour and five minutes. After his address, Councilor Luo Xia Tian and others proposed a motion to endorse Chairman Chiang's report, which was put to a vote by the Chairman and passed. The meeting adjourned at 12:30 PM. At 7:30 PM in the evening, the Chairman hosted a banquet for all the Council members at the Military Affairs Commission auditorium, expressing his high praise.</p>
<p>[Chongqing, Associated Press, 1st] In his address to the People's Political Council on the 1st, Chairman Chiang forcefully stated that Sino-Soviet cooperation is a fundamental principle for the happiness of the Far East and the entire world. He said: The Soviet Union desires peace as much as China does, and will therefore abide by the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and its annexes, which form the basis for cooperation between the two countries.</p>
<p>Soviet Union Orders Troops Stationed in Northeast to Directly Negotiate with Us on Handover</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang stated: In its response to the Soviet Union's note regarding the withdrawal of troops, the National Government has requested the Soviet side to specify the locations from which Soviet troops will withdraw and to assist the National Army in carrying out the takeover work. He said that the Soviet Union has instructed the Northeast Soviet Military Headquarters to directly consult with General Dong Yianping on handover matters. Chairman Chiang forcefully stated that there must be no political issues in the Northeast, and pointed out that political parties or individuals who create political issues to satisfy their own interests are hindering the takeover work and increasing diplomatic difficulties. When reporting on the Ghulja Incident in early November 1944, the Chairman admitted that the situation had been extremely serious for a time. The safety of Dihua was under great threat last year. To resolve this issue, the government sent General Zhang Zhizhong to Xinjiang. As a result of discussions, an agreement including eleven points was largely reached. He pointed out that Xinjiang has close geographical and economic relations with the Soviet Union, and it is therefore important to maintain friendly relations with both Xinjiang and the Soviet Union at the same time. However, he agreed that according to the Sino-Soviet Treaty, Xinjiang is an integral part of China's internal affairs, and the Soviet Union will not interfere.</p>
<p>No Legal System Can Replace the Constitution Drafted by the National Assembly</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang continued, saying that the Second Plenary Session of the Kuomintang believed that the four resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference contradicted the constitution. He said: The Political Consultative Conference stipulated that if the Legislative Yuan loses confidence in the Executive Yuan, the Executive Yuan may tender its resignation or request the President to dissolve the Legislative Yuan, but the Premier of the Executive Yuan may not request the dissolution of the Legislative Yuan more than once. The Second Plenary Session suggested that the Executive Yuan should not be responsible to the Legislative Yuan, nor should it have the power to request the dissolution of the Legislative Yuan. The Communist Party has also designated members of the party to participate in the government, and has not submitted the names of National Assembly representatives to the National Assembly. Chairman Chiang expressed his regret for this. He continued: "The Communist Party's suggestion to abolish the Provisional Constitution and organize a new government of all parties and factions has surprised us. No legal system can replace the constitution passed by the National Assembly.

Not only to train the Chinese Air Force, but also to assist China National Aviation Corporation. There are still 300 or 400 US military officers coming to China. They are specialized and experienced and will contribute to the training work. The US military personnel in Chongqing will also be completely disbanded on May 1st after the government returns to the capital. There are currently several hundred people who need to assist the US embassy in relocating.</p>
<p>Lieutenant General Gillon to Succeed as Commander</p>
<p>After the US military headquarters in the China Theater is closed, it will be renamed the US Army Command in China. After General Wedemeyer leaves China, his mission will be succeeded by Lieutenant General Gillon. After May 1st, it will be changed to the Commander-in-Chief of the US Army in China, but General Gillon represents Special Envoy Marshall and must work in Beiping and cannot come to Shanghai often.

<h3>Soviet Union Still Shows No Sign of Reply; UN Security Council Remains Pessimistic; Gromyko Continues to Remain Silent; Soviet Diplomatic Courier Flies to the US Carrying Important Official Documents</h3>
<p>[United Press, New York, 31st]: The Security Council has been adjourned for two days. There is no new indication as to whether the Soviet Union will respond to the United Nations' request for the Soviet and Iranian governments to explain the truth about the Soviet troop withdrawal negotiations. Therefore, the optimistic attitude of the Security Council representatives has diminished today. Soviet Ambassador Gromyko continues to remain silent, refusing to make any comments to reporters, but when reporters asked whether he had received instructions from the Kremlin, Gromyko replied: "I, like other representatives, am in constant contact with my government." He did not indicate any action by the Soviet government. Security Council representatives hope that the Soviet and Iranian governments will reply soon, so that the Council can obtain assurances of Soviet troop withdrawal, and the Soviet demand for Iranian concessions can be eased. At the same time, Gromyko can re-attend the Council meeting on Wednesday. According to the Iranian Ambassador to the United States, although the talk of Soviet troop withdrawal is rampant, Soviet troops are still stationed in areas such as Azerbaijan, Gilan, Mazandaran, Gorgan, and Khorasan.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, New York, 31st]: The United Nations Security Council is now in the stage of collecting reports. Its second step will be to determine whether the presence of Soviet troops in Iran constitutes a "threat to peace, breach of the peace, or act of aggression." If it has to take this decision, the Council will encounter a major test. However, if the Soviet Union can provide satisfactory assurances, declaring that its troops will unconditionally withdraw from Iran, then the Council can avoid taking this step. If the Soviet Union does not provide assurances, then the Council will request the submission of reports again, otherwise it will proceed in accordance with Article 39 of the United Nations Charter. That article stipulates that the Security Council must determine whether peace has been threatened or broken, and then decide how to deal with it.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, New York, 1st]: Iran and the Soviet Union signed a treaty of friendship on February 26, 1921. During this discussion of the Soviet-Iranian dispute by the United Nations Security Council, this treaty may be suddenly submitted as evidence before the discussion is completed.</p>

Although military personnel do not need to provide opinions on world politics during peacetime, warning of the terribleness of future wars is also permissible. Even in the past, World War I was more dangerous than any previous war, and World War II was even worse than World War I, so future wars will inevitably be even more terrible and will become a global war. With the development of long-range rockets and atomic energy, controlled by radio, the extent of destruction can be imagined.</p>

<h3>Greek Elections May be Announced Today; Right-Wing Dominates; Prime Minister Tsaldaris Submits Resignation Requesting Temporary Stay</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper]: London broadcast on the 1st: In the Greek elections, the right-wing party has clearly gained an absolute advantage, and Greek Prime Minister Tsaldaris has submitted his resignation. The Regent has asked him to temporarily stay in his post until a new government is formed.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Athens, 1st]: Conflicts broke out between the Greek Communist Party and government forces today, killing twenty people. The conflict was caused by the holding of general elections. According to unofficial vote count reports, the Communist Party and other left-wing parties have suffered a crushing defeat. According to initial vote count reports, the People's Party (a united political party composed of right-wing parties such as royalists) has won the most votes and may occupy seventy-five seats in Congress.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Athens, 1st]: Yesterday, under the protection of a large number of military police preventing conflicts between left-wing and right-wing parties, the Greek people conducted their first general election in ten years. All left-wing parties refused to participate in the election, so the victory of the royalist group led by the People's Party is a foregone conclusion. Voting began early yesterday morning. A total of 2,317,911 people are eligible to vote. Election monitoring teams from the United Kingdom, the United States, and France were assigned to inspect the voting stations. A conflict occurred in Merigala Village, Peloponnese, killing two people. In Athens, the police clashed with demonstrators protesting the election the night before the election, resulting in injuries to fifteen civilians and four police officers. The voting was originally scheduled to end in the evening, but it was extended by three hours due to the large number of voters flocking near the end. The final results are expected to be announced tomorrow.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Athens, 31st]: Greek Prime Minister Tsaldaris declared before the start of voting that the current situation is not conducive to fair elections. He told reporters again this evening that the Athens election was a model and that he was quite satisfied.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Athens, 31st]: Although left-wing parties in the Greek general election distributed slogans calling on the people to "not participate in the election manipulated by the United Kingdom," voters voted very enthusiastically, accounting for 63.5%, more than any previous election.</p>

<h3>Lava Flows From Japanese Sakurajima Volcano</h3>
<p>Villagers Say It Is Caused By Offending Heaven</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Tokyo Dispatch]: The Sakurajima Volcano in southern Japan has been spewing ash smoke and rocks for 22 days. The lava is boiling, half a mile wide and two and a half miles long, and continues to flow down the slope towards the small village of Kurokami at a rate of three or four feet per hour. It will soon flow into Kagoshima Bay, and may solidify into a narrow path connecting Sakurajima to the Kyushu mainland. The above is a report from our news photographer, Taisorio, who made aerial observations from a Navy plane. Common old villagers believe that Japan's defeat angered the gods, so the volcano erupted. It is said that the Emperor's brother recently went to a shrine in the mountains behind Kagoshima to report to the gods that Japan had been defeated, and soon after, the Sakurajima volcano erupted.</p>

<h3>New Inventions Emerge Daily; Alloy Light Emitting Body Compares with the Sun and Moon; Radar Guided Missiles Possess Astonishing Power; Infrared Electric Eyes Can See in the Dark</h3>
<p>[Reuters, New York, Day 1] Several new scientific inventions have recently been announced here. One is a new light emitting body invented by Western Union Telegraph Company, the light emitted by which is said to be half that of sunlight. The light emitting body that has already been manufactured is made of alloy and has a diameter of only three thousandths of an inch. The entire light bulb is only the size of the smallest vacuum tube in an ordinary household radio, and the light it emits is one-sixteenth of that of sunlight. When observing it, one must wear the darkest sunglasses to avoid eye damage. Another new invention is a radar-guided bomb nicknamed "Bat," which is twelve feet long and ten feet wide, with a radar device weighing only two hundred pounds installed at its nose. The bomb stores half a ton of explosives. When used, it is carried by a mother ship to a location closer to the target and released. Guided by the radar on the bomb, it can automatically search for ships on the sea surface and sink them. During the later stages of the Pacific War, American aircraft used this amazing new weapon to sink many enemy ships. Another invention is an infrared electric eye, which can observe the situation within ten to fifteen miles in the dark. It is invented by applying the principle of absorbing infrared rays. Therefore, any object that emits heat, such as trains, cars, airplanes, and human bodies, can be observed using these electric eyes. Other new inventions include air exchangers in submarines, methods for manufacturing high explosives, and mosquito repellents. Using these mosquito repellents, mosquitoes will avoid them for six hours.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Economic Recovery and Labor Strikes</h3>
<p>Currently, both the government and the public are concerned about China's economic recovery, especially whether the industrial construction will quickly yield results. China's industrial construction, in the eyes of advanced Western countries, is truly "a promising younger generation," so why are we now raising questions like "is there hope?" It's quite simple. Because currently, some authorities do not seem to genuinely regard encouraging production as a priority, and sometimes, intentionally or unintentionally, they hinder or damage production. Economic recovery is the preliminary work for large-scale national economic construction, and the primary meaning of this preliminary economic recovery is production. However, nowadays, production is only mentioned verbally by most people and not actually valued. As a result, economic recovery has suffered a tremendous setback – it can even be said that Chinese industry will suffer a fatal blow in its infancy!</p>
<p>Throughout history, Chinese and foreign works on economics are numerous, but the most concise and important words are the four sentences from the "Great Learning": "Produce in abundance, consume sparingly; work diligently, spend freely." We are now in the aftermath of a great war, with military expenses just subsiding and wounds still unhealed. Although victory has been seven months, transportation is not yet fully open, and order is not yet fully established. The strange phenomenon of factories closing in the rear and being sealed off at the front has not improved much to this day. Prices are high, life is unstable, and labor strikes are erupting everywhere, especially in Shanghai, like an epidemic. In this situation, strikes and slowdowns are seen as commonplace, which is far removed from the famous saying "work diligently." As a result, existing factories will close down, emerging industries will stall, and the lives of laborers will become even more unstable. A wave of unemployment will follow the wave of strikes, inevitably contradicting the instruction "produce in abundance." On the other hand, despite the slowdowns or strikes during work and the poverty after unemployment, food still needs to be eaten, and clothes still need to be worn. Not only that, but every month, eating and clothing must be done according to the "cost of living index." Thus, there are "many" who only consume and "more" who need relief. Individuals are poor, society is poorer, and the nation is especially poor. If at this time we all believe that since peace has arrived, people should enjoy themselves, regardless of the production situation, and without making efforts to increase production, but only know how to demand the restoration of our pre-war consumption standards (which is the meaning of demanding wages according to the cost of living index), thinking that this is satisfactory, then China's immature industry will inevitably be damaged by those with this mentality, and in the end, everyone will perish together?</p>
<p>The Second Plenary Session of the Kuomintang Central Committee passed a financial and economic sub-proposal, clearly stating: "Whether in economics or finance, to address the symptoms and the root causes, the general principle should be to increase production. The phenomena of factories being sealed off at the front and停工ing in the rear in the past must not be allowed to exist again, causing workers to lose their jobs and society to be unstable." Now, half a month has passed since the closing of the Second Plenary Session. How much progress has actually been made? Judging from the manifestations of all parties, financial capital is still gambling on stocks and bonds, and floating capital is still rampant outside the financial circles, without being guided to the proper use. The bad phenomenon of usury is still "increasingly severe," transportation and transportation are still not smooth, raw materials and all prices still cannot be stabilized, fuel is still not fully supplied due to excessive control, and power is said to be reaching a point where it cannot bear any more burden (which is equivalent to saying that the power cannot be supplied to the resuming factories). All these indicate that production is still full of thorns, making people hesitate. Not only that, but recently, the soaring prices have stimulated the turmoil in the lives of laborers, and the wave of slowdowns and strikes is smooth, with wages and prices almost racing to increase, adding a new obstacle to production. For the sake of the future of industry, for the sake of the lives of laborers, and for the sake of the country's entire economic construction, we cannot help but point out that the disease of the entire economic world is now very serious.</p>
<p>The meeting on the last day of the Second Plenary Session passed the emergency measures for accelerating economic recovery proposed by President Song, stipulating that labor-capital disputes should be mediated and arbitrated by the government, and no slowdowns or strikes should be allowed without authorization. If arbitration fails, the government may take over the operating enterprise. As for the employees of state-owned enterprises, they are regarded as civil servants and are not allowed to strike. Mayor Qian of Shanghai recently also announced four principles for handling labor-capital disputes: (1) State-owned enterprises shall not slow down or strike; (2) Strikes and slowdowns should be banned if they have not gone through legal procedures; (3) Demands that cannot be accepted by China's current production situation should be rejected; (4) Illegal and excessive actions should be sanctioned. It can be seen that the central and local authorities have seen this major crisis hindering production in the sound of economic recovery and want to make some remedies. We would like to point out some questionable points in the recent handling of labor strike incidents, hoping that the authorities will quickly make reasonable corrections, otherwise, it will invisibly damage the lifeline of economic recovery.</p>
<p>First, employees' wages can use the cost of living index as a discretionary reference to stabilize their lives, but they should not be absolutely based on the cost of living index, so that factories exceed their ability to bear. At present, people across the country who rely on wages for a living, except for a very small part of the people in Shanghai, have never received wages absolutely according to the cost of living index. Especially soldiers and civil servants and teachers, who are strong pillars of the war of resistance, but what is their income? Even with the recent adjustment of salary increases, those with a base salary of 100 yuan can only get 65,000 yuan, which is equivalent to 650 times before the war. The higher the salary level, the smaller the multiple. The lives of soldiers are even more unattainable. The government has the power to issue currency, and banknotes can be printed at will. It also has a monopoly business in its hands, but it still does not dare to issue wages to employees based on the cost of living index. How can it first force private enterprises to issue 1,845 times in January and 2,754 times in March? It must be known that employees' wages should be increased to the point where they can stabilize their lives, but at the same time, the general production situation should be taken into account to see if the strength can bear it. We already have a cost of living index as a reference on one hand, but what is the production index of our various agricultural, industrial, and mining industries? The government only knows how to urge everyone to restore the pre-war consumption level, but it has not considered that the social production capacity at this time has absolutely not restored the pre-war production level (let alone increase production). This kind of caring for the past without considering the future will inevitably lead to an irreversible ending. Because the factory's expenses have increased, and the production is not enough to match it, in addition to raising prices to survive, there is only "open the door and be lucky!" According to the former, prices and wages chase each other, and wages may still not catch up with prices, which is only obvious to employees in front of them; according to the latter, factories close down, and employees lose their jobs, so how can they receive wages according to the cost of living index? In any case, it is unfavorable to both the factory and the employees.</p>
<p>Second, employees' pre-war wages should be based on their respective positions and should not have rigid general regulations. Because each person's job is different, and the salary they receive is also different. Since the cost of living index is used as a reference, the current wages should be formulated according to their respective positions and with reference to the proportion. Then, follow the treatment methods of civil servants and teachers and adjust them every three months. If you must force a minimum amount for the pre-war wages of a business first, and then multiply it according to this, then the so-called minimum amount is actually equal to creating something out of nothing. Moreover, when the investigation is not clear enough, casually determining this pre-war salary will increase the base salary to a certain extent, which is nominally helping laborers, but in fact, it increases the factory's unreasonable additional burden, and eventually, it will not be able to bear it and close down. Laborers will suffer the pain of unemployment, and the country will also suffer the damage of economic decline.</p>
<p>Third, equal pay for equal work should not be widely cited and become equal pay for equal industry. Originally, the term equal pay for equal work refers to male and female workers. If they do the same work, they should get the same remuneration. It does not mean that workers in the same industry must receive the same wages. For workers, the nature of work has different classifications, the technical skills have different levels, and the length of service has different lengths. Even workers in the same factory have no reason to have completely the same salaries. For factories, the capital has different sizes, and the business has different booms and slumps. Each factory in the same industry can only be roughly similar, but it cannot be the same without any difference. If you indiscriminately use the term "equal pay for equal work" in a confused manner, thinking that if you eat in a certain industry, you must take a certain kind of salary, then should the waiters of the Waldorf Hotel receive the same wages as the tea houses of the Lao Gao Sheng Zhan class? Everything in the world is beyond reason. If it is not reasonable, and you want to promote it forcibly, you will inevitably run into a wall and then stop. By the time the method runs into a wall, the future of industry will be unimaginable.</p>
<p>At present, everyone is anxiously looking forward to economic recovery, and even more so to economic construction. We must remember that the first thing is to make factories open their doors, and the second is to make employees stable, so we should be very careful not to let the unlimited epidemic of labor strikes spread, causing employees to clamor for strikes and slowdowns every day, and factories to prepare for closing down and shutting down every day. We must recognize this premise and not take the wrong path, so that the country's economic recovery work will not suffer a fatal blow.</p>

<h3>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Convenes Various Guilds to Hold a Discussion Meeting; Discuss How to Cope with the Industrial Crisis; The Chamber of Commerce Will Submit Five Points of Advice on Labor Strikes to the Government</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] In response to the requests of the woolen textile industry and other guilds, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce specially convened various industrial guilds in the city at its meeting room at 3 p.m. yesterday to hold a discussion meeting. More than 20 representatives from various industrial guilds attended, chaired by Jin Runxiang, the executive director of the Chamber of Commerce. He briefly stated that there are three motivations for today's meeting:</p>
<p>(1) In the past, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce served both industry and commerce, but now it is proposed to establish an Industrial Committee separately to meet the needs of the industrial community. (2) Recently, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce received an official letter from the Bureau of Social Affairs, roughly stating that it is organizing a consumer cooperative for employees of various factories in the city. It has convened preparatory meetings three times, and the second preparatory meeting decided that the Chamber of Commerce should be the natural standing preparatory committee member of the preparatory committee, and invited the various industrial guilds in the city to jointly nominate 20 preparatory committee members to promote preparatory matters. (3) In recent years, labor strikes have been rampant, and various factories have been the first to bear the brunt. A reasonable solution should be sought to prevent labor strikes from deteriorating. Then, Yan Eji, the secretary-general of the Chamber of Commerce, reported the contents of the letters from the Bureau of Social Affairs and the woolen textile industry guild. Representatives from the woolen textile industry guild, the handkerchief weaving industry guild, the electrical machinery weaving industry guild, etc., spoke one after another, expressing their heartfelt words on the current industrial crisis and the handling of labor strikes in various industries. Luo Qinghua and Wang Xianqing, members of the Municipal Party Headquarters, also spoke one after another, analyzing many of the difficulties. The discussion meeting lasted until 7:30 p.m. before it came to an end. The main points are summarized as follows: Regarding</p>
<p>Labor Strike Issues</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce will send a letter to the Municipal Government and the Bureau of Social Affairs, suggesting five points: (1) The base salary of each factory should be based on the pre-war level and then calculated according to the monthly cost of living index. (2) Before mediating labor-capital disputes, the employer should be consulted first to investigate the actual situation. (3) Please pay attention to the discipline when the competent authorities mediate, for example, the number of representatives from both sides should be equal when attending negotiations. (4) The labor side shall not interfere with the factory's handling or regulations of its own administrative affairs.

<h3>Recurring Labor Strikes: Over Seventy Factories in the Third District Machinery Industry Resume Work; Bathhouse Industry Also Resumes Operations</h3>
<p>Labor-management disputes in over 150 factories in the Third District machinery industry of this city have shown improvement after several mediations by the Social Affairs Bureau. Over seventy companies have now resumed work. The industry's labor union is making every effort to persuade the remaining factories to resume operations quickly. Workers in various factories also hope for an early resolution. Yesterday afternoon, they sent a delegation of over 120 representatives to the Social Affairs Bureau to petition for a swift resolution. Negotiations between the two parties regarding wage adjustments are also gradually nearing an agreement. Furthermore, the labor strike in the bathhouse industry is still awaiting mediation, but it was decided to resume work across the board today.</p>
<p>Foreign News Agencies</p>
<p>The Chinese employees of this city's commercial news agencies, including British Reuters, American Associated Press, and United Press, experienced a labor dispute yesterday. Reuters' employee base salary for February was originally 41,160 yuan, but the total salary for March was only 45,000 yuan. The Associated Press originally promised a base salary of 45 yuan for March, but suddenly reversed the agreement and changed it to 22 to 25 yuan. The labor side demanded to maintain the original salary, calculated based on the cost of living index. Yesterday, posters were put up throughout the city to expand publicity, and a written request was submitted to the Social Affairs Bureau for mediation.</p>
<h3>Second and Third General Meetings of the Municipal Provisional Assembly: Councilors Raise Numerous Questions, Two Bureau Chiefs Respond Separately with Enthusiasm</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The second general meeting of the Shanghai Municipal Provisional Assembly began yesterday morning at 9:15 AM, concurrently holding a memorial week. Twenty-nine members attended, with seven more arriving later. The Director of the Public Works Bureau, Zhao Zukang, then reported on the work of the Public Works Bureau (report highlights recorded separately). During the report, Director Zhao used both Chinese and English specialized terms in his explanation, but Councilor Yong Xiangyun stood up and requested that the Director not use English.</p>
<p>Improvements in Water Accumulation</p>
<p>After the report was completed, the councilors raised questions one after another. Councilor Feng Zhenqi stood up and said: I live in West Shanghai. Although there has been continuous rain recently, there is still a lot of water accumulation, but it has improved compared to the past. The hard work of the Public Works Bureau deserves admiration. He also expressed his agreement with the bureau's collection of benefit fees and issuance of municipal bonds to supplement funding, but hoped for a detailed explanation.</p>
<p>Hou Junren said: The banks of the Suzhou River and the Beixinjing area often suffer from floods, causing severe damage to farmers' fields. The Public Works Bureau should quickly take remedial measures. Cao Jun proposed that the work of the Public Works Bureau is entirely focused on the urban area, neglecting the suburbs. He hoped that the bureau would also take care of the suburbs in the future. At the same time, when building public housing, priority should be given to helping the most severely affected citizens, especially those in areas such as Dachang and the Hua Flying Field, whose homes were destroyed by the enemy to build airports, leaving a large number of people displaced. Shen expressed that the report of the Public Works Bureau was still insufficient and asked the Director to provide a detailed explanation of the plan, and not to gloss over the past due to economic difficulties.</p>
<p>Rushing to Create a Budget</p>
<p>Pan Xulun contributed his opinion: The Public Works Bureau must submit a concrete plan to this Provisional Assembly, divided into a three-year or five-year plan, and urgently estimate the budget. After this assembly makes a decision, it should be implemented as soon as possible. Shui Xiangyun believed that the dredging of underground sewers was not sufficient. What about the workers' treatment, accommodation, and other issues? In addition to Western people's names for roads, he hoped to avoid changes, and at the same time, should do more publicity to make it easier for people to remember. In addition, the roads should be widened to benefit pedestrians, and it was suggested that the municipal government should expand the budget of the Public Works Bureau. Ye Fenghu requested a rapid solution to the housing shortage. Dilapidated public ditches in the alleys should be repaired quickly to improve sanitation. Xu Yongzuo recalled his previous inquiry about the demolition of houses on North Zhejiang Road and requested a response. Furthermore, the work of the Public Works Bureau only focuses on the surface and is impractical, only repairing roads traveled by important people, while neglecting the roads on both sides. In addition, the Mayor's report on the Public Works Bureau's expenses differed from the Director's report by 300 million. Why is there such a discrepancy? The Public Works Bureau's expenses account for one-seventh of the city's total, which is too little. Tong Chuantian first asked why the hundreds of acres of land encircled by the silk weaving network in Zhabei have not been demolished? The Shanghai Sea Dike is dangerous, and taking responsibility for building it is a matter of urgent priority. Shen Chunhui expressed that each bureau should have a detailed report on the work plan from September of last year to this year.</p>
<p>Bureau Director's Response</p>
<p>Director Zhao immediately responded: (1) Urban planning and project funding have all been planned and are available for everyone to refer to and discuss. (2) Suburban projects have been carried out to the best of our ability, but are really limited by funding and cannot be expanded. (3) To dredge the ditches and canals, private individuals must gather together to find ways, and the Bureau has promoted this method. (4) Widening Zhejiang Road is intended to expand north-south traffic. Now that citizens are requesting a delay in demolition, the municipal government authorities can be asked to reconsider. (5) The housing shortage is due to insufficient funding and materials. Other issues will be answered in writing. The meeting adjourned at 12:10 PM. The chairman received a written proposal stating that several councilors opposed tea and refreshments in order to save money. It was passed by the entire body to cancel them.</p>
<p>Third General Meeting</p>
<p>At 3:30 PM, the third general meeting continued, but only 26 people attended initially. Councilor Wang Yansong temporarily moved that the number of attendees at the meeting was too small and requested a restriction. Wang Genzhong moved that each bureau be asked to give an oral report, limited to a maximum of one hour, and that their written reports should be distributed the day before so that they could be read in detail in the evening. Then, Director of the Public Utilities Bureau, Zhao Zengjue, attended to report (report highlights recorded separately). After a ten-minute break, the councilors raised questions: Xu Yongzuo believed that the street lights were still too dim, especially when walking on rainy days, which was very inconvenient. He hoped to restore them to the situation in July 1937 as soon as possible. Some citizens criticized that the enemy and puppet vehicle licenses were being handled by someone, and an investigation should be requested. Fu Tongxian also felt the same way. Ye Fenghu said: "4" and "5" series telephone lines should best be moved to the "1" and "9" districts to solve the inconvenience for users in those areas. The Telecommunications Bureau of the Ministry of Transportation also felt inconvenient to call, can there be improvement mechanisms and technical measures? And hope to expand the north-south bus lines in the shortest period of time, and there should also be a detailed explanation of the principle of unified public utilities. Pan Xulun found that the director's report only focused on the technical aspects, and did not include financial and budget matters. The tram price can be increased to 200 yuan, so that may be able to increase the number of vehicles, in order to avoid congestion.</p>
<p>Telephone Black Market</p>
<p>Zhao Banfu said: The traffic company lacks tires the most, can the government come forward to purchase them from the US military authorities on its behalf? It has also been heard that a black market has been discovered for the widespread installation of telephones. Telephones in the Nanshi area are particularly unclear. Calling twice makes you sweat! He also felt that resting for three hours during the meeting was too time-consuming. Lu Enhu pointed out that if the water pipes are not repaired, the landlord will restrict the water usage time, which will not only cause disputes between tenants but also waste materials. Telephone names do not match reality, and repairs are not satisfactory. What are the plans to improve?</p>
<p>Suburban Transportation</p>
<p>Xu Shihao hoped that the Public Utilities Bureau's regulations would be reviewed as soon as possible. US military trucks are overloaded, damaging the road surface and should be prohibited. Cao Jun requested the increase of commercial public bus companies. Hou Junren took into account the inconvenience of suburban villagers transporting vegetables and food, and methods should be found to expand the routes and allocate vehicles.</p>
<p>Responding to Various Points</p>
<p>Director Zhao immediately answered one by one: (1) I feel very sorry for the omissions in the financial and regulatory announcements. A public utilities monthly magazine will be issued tomorrow, with various regulations published in installments, for reference. (2) Since the Public Utilities Bureau was taken over, very little money has been received, and most of it has been spent on ferries and public buses. (3) Adjusting vehicle prices must be done in accordance with central regulations and cannot be done arbitrarily. However, on the one hand, the burden on citizens must be taken care of, and on the other hand, the company should not be allowed to suffer losses. Only 50 of the 100 public buses received can be pieced together. (4) Regarding the issue of increasing vehicles, it is estimated that the British company will increase 210 vehicles in the shortest period of time. Preliminary negotiations have also been conducted with commercial bus companies to allow them to operate suburban vegetable transportation. (5) Tire matters have been requested from the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration to handle on their behalf. (6) Regarding the matter of license handling, we are making every effort to investigate. If it is found that any staff member is suspected, they will be immediately sent to the police station for investigation and suspended from their duties. (7) There are not enough telephone operators, making it difficult to get through immediately. In the future, it is planned to set up a separate exchange for lines used by agencies so that internal calls do not have to go through external lines. (8) Appropriate measures will be taken to repair water pipes. (9) It is expected that street lights will gradually be restored within the next year. The meeting adjourned at 6:00 PM. Today, the Health Bureau will report in the morning, the Education Bureau will report in the afternoon, the Social Affairs Bureau will report on the morning of the 3rd, and the first group review meeting will be exchanged on the morning of the 4th.</p>
<p>Also, Councilors Zhu Su and Lu Huimin exchanged views with local women's groups at 583 Tao'erfeis Road at 2:00 PM the day before yesterday to discuss women's issues that should be raised by the assembly. At 7:00 PM last night, they also held a reception at the Central Western Restaurant to release several proposals to local newspaper reporters.</p>
<h3>Please Consider the Tenants of Chun Yuan Li</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Over 100 members of the Chun Yuan Li Tenants Association in Nanshi, representing over 600 tenants in the entire alley, gathered at the entrance of the Provisional Assembly at 111 Nanchang Road at around 8:00 AM yesterday morning to petition because the landlord wanted to demolish the houses and forcibly relocate them. The person in charge of the Assembly promised to discuss the matter with the relevant authorities and kept the petition.</p>
<h3>China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's New Ship: Hai Yi Arrives Yesterday; Qi Mei Scheduled to Be Received This Morning</h3>
<p>(Report from this newspaper) New ships ordered by the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company from the United States have continued to arrive in Shanghai. The Hai Zhong arrived on the 29th of last month. Yesterday afternoon, the Hai Yi also arrived. The names of these ships were named in Chinese in the United States and were flying the national flag. The Hai Zhong was renamed Zhen Mei and was originally scheduled to be received yesterday morning. Due to procedural issues, it was changed to be officially received this morning. Captain Zhu Wenbing, Chief Officer Lu Le, Chief Engineer Qu Gongxin, and others boarded the ship this morning to take over. Since the national flag was already flying, it was not changed. At the time of the takeover, Tan Ju, General Manager Xu Xueyu, and Shipping Department Director Huang, etc., will all personally come to the ship to preside. The Hai Yi, which arrived in Shanghai yesterday, should normally be renamed Shen Kai. After the goods are unloaded, the takeover will be completed on schedule. The other new ships have already started their journey from the United States to Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Old Goods Dealers on Qiujiang Road Secretly Buy Items from Japanese Nationals: Confiscated After Being Discovered by the Military Police Department</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The stalls that buy old goods along Sichuan North Road and Qiujiang Road are densely packed, generating substantial profits. Recently, more than ten stalls specializing in buying old goods secretly purchased various items from Japanese nationals at low prices, such as woodenware, clothing, furniture, etc., and stored them in the empty houses next door to the Xieji Appraisal Store at 522 Qiujiang Road, waiting for the price to rise before reselling them. However, there are regulations prohibiting the private buying and selling of items from Japanese nationals. The authorities had long had regulations in place, and they were eventually discovered by the Third Independent Battalion of the Military Police. Yesterday morning, they dispatched troops to search the address and seized a large number of Japanese furniture, stored in several empty houses. They then used many military trucks to transport the items to the headquarters for confiscation.</p>
<h3>Two Bureau Chiefs Attend Assembly to Report: Aiming to Build the Entire City; Promoting the Enterprise-ization of Public Utilities</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Provisional Assembly held its second meeting yesterday. The Director of the Public Works Bureau, Zhao Zukang, attended to report on the public works situation. The main points are excerpted as follows:</p>
<p>Public Works Bureau Report</p>
<p>There are eight areas of operational implementation: roads, ditches, housing, parks, bridges, docks, rivers, and seawalls, all aiming to build the entire city.</p>
<p>Repairing and dredging ditches and rivers: The city has approximately 430,000 meters of rainwater drainage pipes, of which one-quarter have been dredged. There are approximately 110,000 meters of sewage drainage pipes, of which more than one-third have been dredged. More than 24,300 cubic meters of silt have been removed, so there is less water accumulation in West Shanghai than last year. We are currently planning to demolish shantytowns in order to expand the dredging of rivers and canals.</p>
<p>Repairing roads, bridges, and docks: The city has 1,000 kilometers of roads, with 340,000 square meters of road surface that needs to be repaired. Approximately 40,000 square meters of sidewalks have been repaired, and a portion of new road surfaces and sidewalks have been built. There are 222 bridges, of which 10 have been repaired and 7 are being repaired. There are 35 docks, of which 24 have been repaired and one is being repaired. In addition, there are many docks that do not need repair, urgently need repair, and cannot be repaired.</p>
<p>Building public housing: Last winter, we surveyed and designed four original public housing villages for restoration, with an estimated cost of 350 million yuan at the time. However, due to funding difficulties, construction could not begin. We are currently in negotiations. We are also planning to build 12 new villages.</p>
<p>Renovating the north-south trunk roads: Based in Huangpu District, we will expand north and south, planning to connect Zhabei to the old city center area and Nanshi to Longhua and Caobing.</p>
<p>Designing ditches in West Shanghai and the entire city plan: Divided into two categories: palliative and fundamental. Palliative work includes: (1) clearing ditches, (2) clearing rivers, (3) adding floodgates and building dams, and (4) appropriately raising several sections of the road surface. Fundamental work includes designing and building structures, dredging rivers, and forming a flood control committee to preside over it. The urban plan has repeatedly convened technical symposiums, formed a plan outline, and submitted it to the city government for guidance.</p>
<p>City seawalls: The total length is 114,000 meters, and the sea walls account for 28 kilometers. They have been severely damaged in the past eight years. We have sent staff to investigate in detail and formulate a plan. However, the cost is huge. We are currently planning to take emergency measures and organize an engineering team to prepare for construction.</p>
<p>City parks open to the public: There are 13 parks. As of the end of February, there were more than 1.755 million visitors (excluding those who do not sell tickets). There are 2,744 trees planted along the roads.</p>
<p>There are 30 vegetable markets, with 10,000 fixed stalls. If 8,000 more are needed, we plan to expand the existing vegetable markets and build 10 new ones.</p>
<p>There are also eight areas of preparation or basic work: planning, surveying, inspecting, scaling, documentation, personnel, funding, and materials, all aimed at assisting the implementation of operations. Inspection has been implemented gradually, and norms can be compiled and published soon. Documentation will be simplified, and a system of tiered responsibility is currently being tested. In terms of regulations, a special Regulations Consolidation Committee has been formed to consolidate and formulate regulations, and the first compilation has already been published. The bureau's expenses, as of the current date, total 1.373890464 billion yuan in national currency, including 22 million yuan in repatriation expenses, 288,270,000 yuan in recurring expenses and living allowances, 292,520,000 yuan in recurring expenses for affiliated agencies, and 771,109,0509 yuan in project expenses. Recurring expenses include wages and allowances for regular workers, but funding is limited for various urgent and important projects. As for material supply, it is a prerequisite for all projects. As of now, according to the Materials Department report, the value of building materials received from the Third Front Army and the enemy and puppet regimes is 310,388,960 yuan. The conclusion of the latest report states: The prerequisite for all material construction lies in funding and materials. Therefore, whether the promotion of public works in this city will be effective in the future will depend on the adequacy and readiness of funding and materials. Building materials have been purchased separately from abroad. The sources of funding for municipal engineering projects, in addition to general tax revenue, are the collection of project benefit fees and the issuance of municipal bonds, so as to take from the people and use for the people.</p>
<p>Public Utilities Bureau Report</p>
<p>At the third general meeting in the afternoon, Director of the Public Utilities Bureau, Zhao Huijue, attended and reported. The main points are as follows:</p>
<p>Water Supply: There are currently five units. After the takeover, we stepped up efforts to increase the water supply, removed restrictions, improved water quality, replaced all the filter sand in the pools, transported a large number of alum from Wenzhou, ordered a large amount of liquid gas, filled 20 public wells, and reorganized water pipes and water meters. In the future, the water supply zones will be redrawn. Water plants can be freely invested in by the people. The British Shanghai Waterworks Company will expire next year, and the Shanghai Water and Electricity Company will expire in 1950. At that time, the municipal government will carefully decide on the management methods.</p>
<p>Electricity: There are six units. First, we should remedy the coal shortage, then increase power generation, prevent electricity theft, remove restrictions, expand industrial electricity use, and unify citywide electricity prices. The price for small users within 10 degrees is 12 yuan per degree. In the future, it is planned to be jointly organized by various companies in Shanghai and operated in an enterprise manner. The central government will be in charge of setting up the Jiangnan Electric Power Bureau.</p>
<p>Gas: The supply has been relaxed from 12 degrees per household to 45 degrees. The Wusong Gas Plant has been restored, and the establishment of the Shanghai Urban Gas Company is planned.</p>
<p>Land Transportation: Improving tram transportation. There were 28 lines before the war, and 19 lines have been restored, with 381 vehicles running.</p>
<p>Ten public buses have been repaired, with a total of 41 running. There are currently 5 small train locomotives and 19 passenger and freight cars. A total of 10,529 motorized vehicles and 135,496 non-motorized vehicles have been approved for registration. All vehicles used by the National Army or Allied forces must display a unified license plate. Traffic order has been changed to one-way traffic lines in sections. It is also planned to prohibit rickshaws from operating on Fuzhou Road from Henan Road to Zhongzheng East Road during designated hours. The trolley wires on Nanjing Road will also be removed to facilitate the operation of public buses in the future.</p>
<p>Water Transportation: Ferries have been repaired, with 6 available for use, and docks have been repaired to restore routes. A total of 1,401 ships have been registered. In the future, a municipal ferry company is planned to be established.</p>
<p>Telephone: As of now, Shanghai Telephone Company has approximately 60,000 subscriber lines, 87,000 subscriber telephones, and 16 million calls per month. In the future, it is planned to remove and relocate a portion of the "4" and "5" series lines to the urban area for use. Within five years, the plan is to increase to 140,000 numbers.</p>
<p>Streetlights: Before the war, there were 22,183 streetlights and 1,092 traffic lights. Currently, there are 8,228 streetlights and 932 traffic lights. It is planned that only the old city area can be expanded to 6,000 within this year.</p>
<p>In short, the future plan is to address both the symptoms and the root causes, so that all public utilities can be "rationalized," "enterprised," and "popularized" in order to realize Shanghai as a modern city in the world.</p>
<h3>Case of Murder of American Pilot: Defense Lawyer Discovers New Evidence; Claims That What Sawada Did May Not Be His Responsibility; New Development in This Case, Retrial This Morning</h3>
<p>The Japanese Lieutenant General Sawada Shigeru and others, accused by the US military of murdering an American pilot, continued to be tried by the US military court yesterday. The defendant's defense lawyers, Lieutenant Colonel Bortney and Captain Huaru, personally went to Tokyo several weeks ago to collect defense evidence. It is said that they personally met with the principal of a school in Tokyo who stated that students died because of the American bombing, and brought back broken glass as evidence. Subsequently, they presented the former Japanese Minister of the Army's notes and the former Commander of the China Expeditionary Army, Tian Junliu's testimony to the court. Tojo and Tian Junliu are both imprisoned, but they personally wrote oaths proving Sawada Shigeru's innocence. They also stated that everything he did was due to orders from Tokyo, and also stated that Sawada Shigeru was a wise gentleman, and everything he did was directly instructed by Tokyo, so the fact that he judged the American pilots had nothing to do with Sawada Shigeru. The defendant's defense lawyer also summoned two witnesses from Tokyo to exonerate the defendants. According to those in charge of the case, there will be new developments in the case. It is feared that it will not be possible to conclude it for a while, and a retrial will be held this morning.</p>
<h3>Western Customs: Chinese People Compete to Imitate; April Fool's Day is Full of Jokes</h3>
<p>According to Western customs, yesterday was the annual April Fool's Day. People in this city, both Chinese and foreign, are finally free from the disasters caused by the long-term war and are gradually moving towards a life full of hope and happiness. On this festive day, their excitement is particularly strong, so they could not avoid following the customs.</p>
<p>Yesterday, a certain newspaper in this city first published the news that General Feng Yuxiang and Mr. Guo Moruo and others had jointly flown to Shanghai. Friends of Feng and Guo inquired in various directions after seeing the news, only to learn that the news was an "April Fool's" news item. In another case, a certain gentleman instructed someone to notify his friends by phone yesterday that he had been crushed to death by a car. Everyone who received the call rushed to various places to prepare for the funeral. When they arrived, they saw that their friend was indeed alive and well, and they couldn't help but laugh. There are countless such things of fooling oneself and others, but according to reports from various parties, fortunately, no events have occurred that have caused trouble because of this.</p>
<h3>Slanting Xu Road Dye Factory Robbed – One Wounded Thief Escapes</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] Shao Maotang, the owner of Yu Yi Dye Factory at 1622 Slanting Xu Road in the southern city, woke up around 3:00 AM yesterday. Upon hearing voices from the rear, he roused the staff to investigate. In the back shed, they discovered that several packages of dyed yarn had been stolen, approximately four small packages. Shortly after, they heard knocking on the outer door, which was opened by his eldest son, Chengbing. Two men entered, one claiming to be a police officer from the police station, and the other holding a package of dyed yarn, pretending to be a thief. They inquired whether any dyed yarn had been stolen. Chengbing, believing them to be genuine, did not suspect anything and invited them inside. Unexpectedly, the two men immediately threatened and intimidated them, confining the factory staff in one room. At that moment, more than ten other bandits entered, stormed upstairs into the storage room, and looted fifty-one packages of cotton yarn. During this time, Shao's second son, Shanrong, seized an opportunity to exit through a side door and reported the incident to a guard post at Fenglin Bridge, who then telephoned the Changshu Branch Bureau. Criminal Investigation Squad Inspector Sun Danggeng, Police Chief Xu Shirong, Sergeant Wang Jikui, and several reserve police officers, heavily armed, rushed to the scene with the victim. Upon arrival, Shanrong knocked on the glass window. The unarmed bandits had already taken the stolen goods inside, leaving only one person with a gun. Hearing the knocking, the gunman fled towards the side door. The officers gave chase, but due to the extreme darkness, they only saw a black shadow ahead. They pursued him to Slanting Xu Road, where he fled east into a small lane, reaching the Damu Bridge area, Lane 261. The bandit scaled a wall to escape. The police continued their relentless pursuit. The bandit attempted to fire his weapon to resist arrest, but the bullet jammed. The officers then fired two shots, one hitting him in the abdomen. Despite being wounded, the bandit fled, reaching a horizontal lane and entering the kitchen of a two-unit bungalow. He pushed a hole through the wall and escaped through the hole, disappearing without a trace. At dawn, the bandit's gun was found hidden in a crevice in the mud wall, covered with woolen cloth. The officers returned to the bureau. Around 9:00 AM, Squad Leader Zhang Canguang, accompanied by Inspector Lang Tuanbin from the Pingyin Bridge Police Station, led officers to continue the search. At around 3:30 PM, they discovered the stolen goods, a total of fifty-six small packages, in a grass shed north of Xiaomu Bridge, and brought them to the branch bureau for safekeeping, while intensifying the search for the fleeing bandits.</p>

<p>[Our Reporter] In light of the inability to store the large volumes of supplies successively arriving in Shanghai from UNRRA and the US military, the Enemy and Puppet Industries Handling Bureau of Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Anhui Regions has taken emergency measures starting yesterday, requiring the emptying of sealed warehouses along the riverfront, including Zhaoshangju North Wharf, Central Wharf, Yongxing Warehouse, Jinliyuan Dock, Gonghexing Dock, Dalai Dock, Taigu Dock, and other large and small warehouses, totaling over sixty. Regarding the handling of the supplies, aside from a small portion auctioned by the bureau through customs, the bureau will take a step-by-step auction of each warehouse, thus it is predicted that prices will continue to fall.</p>
<p>[Our Reporter] Jiang Gongmei, the former Shanghai Military Police Commander, seized a large number of enemy and puppet assets during his tenure. The Investigation Team of the Handling Bureau successively discovered a large amount of fabrics, Western medicine, and tires in the Ronghua Warehouse on Jiangxi Road; sugar, oil, and kapok in the Huatong Warehouse at No. 8 the Bund; and frozen meat in the Maotai Refrigeration Warehouse at the Sixteenth Embankment. The estimated value is tens of millions of yuan, and the 23rd Military Police Regiment is guarding them. After approval by the Chongqing Military Police Headquarters, the bureau will auction the goods.</p>
<p>Furthermore, since its establishment, the Investigation Team has discovered over 2,200 cases of enemy and puppet assets by the end of last month, all of which have been submitted to the Handling Bureau for separate processing.</p>

<h3>Bulls Take Profits, Hua Stocks Fall Across the Board, Only Xiangtai Foreign Firm Rises in Foreign Stocks</h3>
<p>Hua stocks saw profit-taking by bulls. At first, the "counterparty" firms continued to respond as usual, but the appetites of the big Sichuan and Hunan "gangs" were enormous, and they gradually sold off. Securities firms sensed a strong downward momentum and soon felt overwhelmed. When the "counterparty" firms were no longer able to absorb the excess volume, they stopped bidding. A scene of panic selling ensued. Yong Yarn fell from 5,650 yuan, Meiya from 4,600 yuan, and Jingfu from 450 yuan. Yong Yarn fell to 4,750 yuan, Meiya to 1,750 yuan, and Jingfu to 375 yuan. The market stabilized slightly after a low at noon. Other less popular stocks, as well as established stocks, followed suit, with those that had risen the most falling the hardest. Those keen on stock speculation should take this as a warning. At noon closing, stocks fell by more than 10% across the board compared to last Saturday. In reality, while yarn factories are profitable, other industries lag far behind. Labor unrest is increasing, foreign goods are flooding in, costs are rising day by day, and inventories are difficult to match imported goods. Although the bubble is getting bigger, it cannot escape the Earth's gravity and fly straight into the distance. If President Song can fulfill his promise to sell all stored materials, credit will inevitably tighten. At that time, those who are bullish on stocks for speculative purposes will become long-term owners. After noon, bids were slightly lower. Among foreign stocks, only Xiangtai Timber Firm rose due to news of its dissolution. It is generally speculated that the firm's assets are sufficient to fully cover the par value in US dollars. The stock jumped by 20%, with few sellers and many buyers. Other stocks, affected by the general downward trend, showed weakness from the start. As a result, Huide Iron and Steel fell by 0.5%, while the rest fell by more than 10%.</p>
<p>Type C Bonds Plunge</p>
<p>The government bond market also collapsed yesterday. Type C bonds opened at 3,460 yuan, immediately pressured by profit-taking. The overall trend was unfavorable, and there were no buyers. The price broke through six major levels, falling to 2,820 yuan. The market stabilized slightly after a low at noon, ending the day down more than 500 yuan compared to last Saturday. Other bonds fell by 180 to 280 yuan.</p>
<h3>Speculative Activity Ceases, Hong Kong Dollar Bills Weaken, US Dollars Also Decline Slightly</h3>
<p>Foreign exchange US dollars generally weakened due to pressure from gold prices, but there was underlying strength due to arbitrage activity involving the purchase of dollars with gold. The market opened around 1,920 yuan, and the price briefly fell below 1,870 yuan at noon, before recovering slightly. The final price was around 1,890 yuan, a slight decrease of 20 yuan compared to last Saturday. Hong Kong dollar bills were also oversupplied, with old bills falling by 15 yuan and new bills, due to the cessation of activity by speculative gangs, weakening and falling sharply by 20 to 25 yuan. Hong Kong dollars were at 435 yuan and Robis at 535 yuan, both selling prices.</p>
<h3>The Netherlands Implements Regulations on Foreign Exchange and Precious Metals – Aiming to Strengthen Foreign Exchange</h3>

Jewelry, valuables, and legitimate merchants' gold and precious metal inventories are excluded.</p>
<h3>Oil Prices Fall by Over 4,000 Yuan, Rice, Noodles, and Beans Also Weaken, Raw Peanuts See Activity from Foreign Firms</h3>
<p>Yesterday's rice market, despite strong sentiment due to the cloudy weather, was unable to rise due to the continuous arrival of goods downstream. The market was stable in the morning but weak in the afternoon, remaining mediocre. Baimi (white rice) was stable at 100 yuan, but there were few buyers. The price of flour from UNRRA, although sales have ceased, continued to fall slightly by 200 yuan due to sluggish sales in other ports and the local market. The oil market continued to weaken, falling by over 4,000 yuan due to the arrival of goods from various sources and a large shipment of rice and goods from Qingdao. Soybean cakes also fell slightly by 200-300 yuan, and bran fell by 100-200 yuan. Soybeans declined again by 500-600 yuan due to abundant arrivals from various ports and poor sales. Corn was sluggish, falling by 1,000 yuan. Sesame was stable, but raw peanuts saw activity from foreign firms, and because local nut shops have resumed operations, retail sales are smooth, and prices have risen by 2,000-3,000 yuan. Cottonseed cakes and vegetable cakes were unchanged.</p>
<h3>Guangdong Gang Stops Purchasing, Yarn Market Languishes</h3>
<p>Yesterday's yarn market entered a slump again. Due to the Guangdong gang's purchasing reaching a temporary saturation point, there was little demand. The price of 20-count "Double Horse" yarn fell to 1.15 million, a decrease of 80,000-90,000 yuan compared to last weekend. Other smaller 20-count yarns also fell by 10,000-20,000 yuan. Only local buyers made occasional purchases. At noon, Textile Construction (紡建) offered a large quantity of yarn, with 42-count and above double-ply yarns marked down by tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of yuan. In particular, 60-count "Yanghe" single yarn was priced at 3.3 million, a decrease of 650,000 yuan compared to the previous period, but purchasing was still not active.</p>
<h3>Textile Construction Purchases Heavily, Raw Cotton Trading Flourishes – Prices Remain Flat</h3>
<p>Yesterday, New York American cotton futures fell by 13 to 15 points. The near-term price was US$27.55, the far-term price was US$27.50, and the Middling spot price was US$28.10. The local raw cotton market was flat, but trading was active again due to purchases by Textile Construction. However, the price was determined by Zhu's sales, resulting in smooth sales but flat prices. Textile Construction acquired 3,900 bales of Midttlingen and Brazilian cotton, and Nantong Dasheng also acquired 200 bales of Midttlingen cotton.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Commission Doubled – Approved by the Central Bank</h3>
<p>The Central Bank's approved foreign exchange brokers expressed that the commission set by the bank was too low and repeatedly requested an increase. After a one-month trial period for brokers, it was resolved at a public meeting yesterday to request a doubling of the commission (originally, the bank's commission was 1.25 cents per 1,000 yuan, and the commission for importers and exporters was 2.5 cents per 1,000 yuan). This was approved by the designated Chinese and foreign banks handling foreign exchange and by the Central Bank.</p>
<h3>Black Tea Stems Have Sales</h3>
<p>With Mingqian Longjing tea (a highly prized green tea harvested before the Qingming Festival) about to be released, tea merchants are becoming less active in trading aged varieties. Those who have made profits are eager to sell, resulting in large-scale unloading and a sharp decline in market sentiment. As a result, prices have fallen by more than 4,000 yuan per dan compared to last week. As for the long-dormant black tea stems, also known as "fragrant Suzhou tea," demand from Suzhou merchants suddenly increased at this opportune time, with substantial buying. However, market sentiment remains weak.</p>
<h3>300,000 Silkworm Eggs Distributed to Silk-Producing Provinces</h3>

<h3>Foreign Timber Arrives Steadily, Market Prices Have All Declined</h3>

<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company (招商局) has ordered ten new ships from the United States for use in Shanghai. Two ships have already arrived in Shanghai, named "Haizhong" and "Haixiao."

It is said that the remaining eight ships will also arrive in Shanghai successively loaded with timber.</p>
<h3>Sellers Arrive in an Endless Stream, Gold Prices Steadily Decline</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market was extraordinarily sluggish, with a sense of desperation. Although the Bank of China's allocation price remained unchanged, rumors spread that it was secretly selling at a discounted price, leading to speculation that the exchange rate against the US dollar was being suppressed to 600 yuan per ten taels. Holders unanimously liquidated their positions, and operators, facing an overwhelming supply, were unable to accommodate all sellers. As a result, the market collapsed. How quickly everything has changed! It is evident that human intervention is at play. If the authorities adopt restrictive measures instead of laissez-faire policies, fragile speculators will likely comply. The market opened with offers to sell at 1.52 million yuan, but quickly broke through the 1.5 million yuan mark. Sellers continued to arrive, leading to despair in the gold market. Operators struggled to cope, and holders became even more panicked. With this selling pressure, the market plummeted to 1.41 million yuan in the afternoon before rebounding slightly to around 1.45 million yuan, a decrease of 45,000 yuan compared to last Saturday. Gold ornaments fell to 158,000 yuan before recovering to 160,000 yuan. Silver was at 1,600 yuan, silver dollars were around 1,000 yuan, and the black market interest rate was stable at 1.6 to 1.8 cents.</p>

The prices are approximately 60% lower than market prices. Therefore, the market price of caustic soda has fallen below 400,000 yuan, and the prices of daily necessities such as soap are also expected to decline. Furthermore, the American firm Hengxin Foreign Firm has recently shipped many kinds of dyes, and the prices are also low. It is said that Indanthrene dyes are also arriving. The liquidation office of Defu Foreign Firm has notified factories to register for the allocation of materials, but the prices are very high. Indanthrene dyes are priced at 16.2 million yuan per dan, 3 million yuan higher than the market price. Factories that received the allocation of these goods suffered losses because they were unaware of the selling price beforehand.</p>

<h3>Panda Gift to England as Reward for Free Education for Chinese Students in England</h3>
<p>[British News Agency, London, 1st] The London Zoo is currently arranging to transport a panda from Chengdu to England. This panda is a gift from the Chairman of the Sichuan Provincial Government and the Director of Education as a gesture of friendship towards England. Several months ago, the panda originally donated by China in the London Zoo unfortunately died, a blow that was not overlooked by Chinese in London. Shortly thereafter, Dr. Y.C. James Yen, the representative of the Chinese Central Propaganda Department stationed in London, wrote to the London Zoo inquiring what gift would be considered most valuable. The London Zoo authorities replied that nothing was more valuable than a panda. Dr. Yen immediately conveyed this intention to the Chinese authorities, who then launched a search to capture another rare panda. At the same time, the London Zoo authorities asked Dr. Yen what reward China most desired. Dr. Yen replied that China wished England could provide free education to a Chinese zoology student. Therefore, as this panda is being shipped to England, a Chinese student will be a guest of the London Zoological Society next year.</p>

<h3>Retracing the Old Battlefields of the Yunnan-Burma Road - Crossing the Nu River in a Single Leaf Pirogue</h3>
<p>— Special Dispatch from Shun-ning by Our Newspaper on the 20th - Qin Ji</p>
<p>Since the joyous sound of victory firecrackers, the people of the rear have slowly been able to see Shanghai newspapers. Because their paper is clean and white, and the printing is clear and bright, everyone who reads them praises them. In Shanghai, they only sell for 30 yuan a copy, but in Kunming they sell for 200 yuan, and in Baoshan they are worth 400 yuan, with demand exceeding supply. Everyone greatly hopes for an opportunity to fly to Shanghai in a day. However, reality often contradicts desires; one wants to go east, but ends up going west. For this reporter to cross the Nu River again is something quite unexpected.</p>
<p>Oil Pipeline</p>
<p>At 9:00 AM on the 10th, two jeeps left Dali. In less than an hour, they passed the scenic Yangbi County. They traveled 20 kilometers uphill to Dabo, then downhill to Huanglian Shu, crossing the Tiesizhu at an altitude of 2350 meters. At 2:00 PM, they arrived at Yongping County, rested for an hour, and continued, crossing the Maizhuang Ya Kou at an altitude of 2532 meters. From there, they descended 30 kilometers to the Lancang River, crossed the Gongguo Bridge, and traveled 20 kilometers along the river, turning west to Wayaopu. As darkness approached, they traveled another 56 kilometers to reach Baoshan. Along the way, they saw dozens of American military transport stations and oil pipeline stations. Speaking of the oil pipeline, it has now been destroyed. This world-famous oil pipeline crossed the world-famous Hump to reach China, with a pump station set up every 30 kilometers. I remember an American officer telling me that one gallon of gasoline transported from India to Zhan Yi cost five US dollars. Calculated at the current value, that's worth 75,000 yuan, demonstrating the cost of gasoline at that time. This oil pipeline could only be operated by the government; commercial firms and private individuals absolutely could not manage it. Regarding southwest industry and transportation, the oil transport relied entirely on Haiphong in Vietnam. We hope that Haiphong will become a free port and that the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway will be jointly managed, which would be greatly beneficial to the prosperity of the southwest. There is also news that four American commercial firms are organizing a company to transport gasoline from India to Burma, using the existing oil pipeline to import it into Yunnan Province. We are very eager for this news, as the price of oil in Yunnan Province has already reached 250,000 yuan per barrel (53 gallons). If there are no more oil import points, southwest transportation will be greatly threatened. As for the oil pipeline machinery being left idle for a long time, even with soldiers guarding it, it will soon turn into scrap metal. We hope the authorities will not only focus on the recovery of coastal areas but also remember the prosperity of the southwestern provinces for national rejuvenation. This is something that should be paid special attention to.</p>
<p>Baoshan</p>
<p>It was already dark when we arrived in Baoshan. The jeep headlights often illuminated two small red lights moving slowly on the road or crossing it and heading into the mountain gullies. Around 8:00 PM, we arrived in Baoshan.</p>
<p>According to legend, Baoshan is the former residence of Meng Huo. The historical sites of Zhuge Liang capturing Meng Huo five times and Zhuge's camp can still be found. About seven-tenths of the houses in the city were destroyed during the war, and approximately 2,000 people were killed in the bombings. It is said that a batch of vehicles belonging to returning overseas Chinese were stopped outside the city and bombed even more severely. We will never forget this blood debt. Later, Baoshan became a counter-offensive base. Large numbers of troops arrived, and many Americans came as well. An airfield was built, and restaurants and theaters were opened. In the spring of last year, when the Burma Road was opened, hundreds of American military transport vehicles arrived every day. Baoshan became a lodging station, exhibiting an abnormal prosperity and transforming into a temporary modern city.</p>
<p>Nu River</p>
<p>At 8:00 AM on the 12th, I continued my journey. From Xiaguan to Baoshan, it is 259 kilometers. From Baoshan to Huitong Bridge, it is 90 kilometers. After climbing over a mountain, we descended to the Nu River. The Nu River, also known as the Salween River, does not rage in winter. A green ribbon of water slowly flows southward, and the sandy beaches contrast with the green water, making it particularly clear. I can tell you that when the Nu River rages during the rainy season. As a reporter, I returned to the rear from Xiangda in mid-September the year before last, crossing at a ferry crossing called "Hanguai Ferry." The night before, it rained all night. Early in the morning, I ran to the riverbank and boarded a leather pirogue, venturing to cross. In an instant, we were hundreds of meters away. Livestock, thatched huts, and even corpses rushed down from upstream, rolling down the river. The distance between the two banks had doubled due to the rising water. The earth-yellow water reflected the dense forest thousands of feet high. It was truly awe-inspiring. I will never forget that day of "crossing the Nu River in a pirogue in the wind and rain." (The troops that crossed the Nu River forcefully all used rubber boats.) Huitong Bridge is a large bridge on the Yunnan-Burma Road and the only bridge over the Nu River. It is said that initially, a merchant whose name I have forgotten, who often did business in Burma, felt the inconvenience of crossing the river and made a lifelong commitment to building a Huitong Bridge. Iron chains hung in the air above the Huitong Bridge, with wooden planks laid on top. People and horses crossed the bridge, swaying precariously. In 1940, when the Yunnan-Burma Road was built, a modern iron cable bridge was rebuilt, which could be crossed by cars. In 1941, when the Japanese invaded, we destroyed the bridge and held out against the enemy across the river for more than two years. It was not until the counter-offensive the year before last that it was rebuilt under the leadership of American engineers in just a few dozen days. It was both sturdy and fast.</p>
<p>Song Mountain</p>
<p>After crossing the Huitong Bridge, there was a 90-kilometer uphill climb. If one were to walk, it might take three days to reach the summit. Forty kilometers uphill is a place called Lameng, with a few houses, which is a street in the middle of the mountain. Beyond Lameng is Song Mountain. When Song Mountain is mentioned, perhaps everyone in the rear knows that the bloody battle of Song Mountain is an indelible page in the history of the war against Japan. As the jeep spiraled upwards, everyone talked about the battle history of Song Mountain. We passed the cemetery of fallen officers and soldiers of the National Army, stopped the car, and deeply paid our respects to them. Their heroic spirits will be immortal along with the famous mountain. The jeep climbed to the highest peak, the weather became colder, and everyone's heart felt equally cold. Amidst the dense shell craters, I remembered the shells that hit Youfa one day, and now I still see five or six indigenous people.</p>
<p>Longling</p>
<p>We stepped on the land where every inch was fought for, and we saw bloodstains on every inch of land. From Song Mountain to Longling, it is a three-hour jeep ride. We arrived in Longling at 3:00 PM. Longling was also a place where the enemy stubbornly defended, and the entire county seat was destroyed. The current street is entirely made up of newly built houses.</p>
<p>Mangshi</p>
<p>After passing Nantian Dou, we saw the Tongguo Garden. Down below is Mangshi City. The climate in Mangshi is particularly warm, the bamboo is evergreen year-round, and the banyan trees grow tall, with people living under the trees. Entering Mangshi is like entering a Burmese-Yunnan landscape. Most of the residents are Baiyi, and their clothing and language are different from ours, as are their customs. Their chieftain is very young. There is a deputy named Fang Keguang, who is in his forties, and people call him Deputy Fang the Third. When the Japanese came, it is said that he was a prisoner. When the Japanese retreated, he escaped. But according to the current Deputy Fang the Fourth, Fang Keguang was a traitor who collaborated with the enemy. It is unknown who was collaborating and who was patriotic. In short, everyone collaborated when the enemy came, and everyone became patriotic when the enemy left. The chieftain's yamen, Yufeng Garden, was formerly the enemy's headquarters and is now the regimental headquarters of the garrison. After being renovated, the garden is full of lush flowers and trees. Camellias and cannas are in bloom. At noon, even wearing a woolen sweater, one still feels hot, showing the unique climate of Mangshi.</p>
<p>Deputy Fang told me that there are now twelve Zhongzheng Elementary Schools and that there is adequate funding. He plans to use 20,000 baskets of rice husks to run a Zhongzheng Elementary School. The teachers' salary is 400 silver dollars per year, equivalent to 400,000 yuan in national currency. I visited their Zhongzheng Elementary School in Xin Jie and saw a few simple buildings, with desks, chairs, and benches in fairly good order. The teachers are Han Chinese, and the curriculum does not include Yi language. I hope there will be some instruction in Baiyi language. The Baiyi language is the written language passed down by Yi monks, but this written language is not sufficient. I also heard Deputy Fang say that before the war, the Baiyi were unwilling to attend school, and each family had to pay money to get a child to study. After the Japanese came, the Baiyi suffered all kinds of abuse from the enemy. China finally won the war, and now every family is willing to send their children to school voluntarily. Now, we must preserve the Baiyi language of the Baiyi and hope that they receive the same education, enjoy equal rights with us Han people in law, and fulfill the same obligations, unlike the Japanese who forced the Baiyi to become cannon fodder.</p>
<p>Deputy Fang has a son who is sixteen years old this year. He attended the Overseas Chinese Middle School in Burma and Yunnan for a year. He wears Western clothes, is handsome, and is not much different from our Suzhou young masters. I advised him to go to Kunming to study soon and not waste his youth at home.</p>
<p>Tengchong</p>
<p>From Mangshi, turning towards Longling, there is a northwest branch road, about 80 kilometers, which leads directly to Tengchong. Tengchong is a famous border city. We knew it when we were elementary school students. It is an important stronghold in the extreme southwest of our country. The Anglo-Chinese treaty opened it as a commercial port, but there was a consulate without any British residents. Today, Tengchong is an empty city. During the counter-offensive in 1944, the battle for Tengchong lasted forty evenings before the enemy was completely annihilated. Tengchong had the most heavily fortified enemy defenses, and we were also the first to conquer it. Some say it was due to the great fortune of Commander-in-Chief Huo. Indeed, Commander-in-Chief Huo has an auspicious appearance, and everyone acknowledges that he is a lucky general for the country. Outside Tengchong City, in Niulipu, on a small knoll at the foot of Laifeng Mountain, lie the ashes of more than 5,000 people. This is the National Cemetery Park, also known as the cemetery for the fallen soldiers in the counter-offensive of Tengchong. In front of the tomb's memorial hall, there are four large characters: "碧血千秋" (Eternal Loyalty), with the inscription "Written by Chiang Kai-shek, Inscribed by Li Genyuan, Supervisor of Yunnan and Guizhou." As we walked into the National Cemetery Park and saw these four characters, thinking of the person who wrote them, the person who inscribed them, and the people who were buried there, we couldn't help but feel a sense of solemn respect. A hundred meters from the memorial hall is a small tomb inscribed with the two large characters "倭塚" (Japanese Tomb). It is said that the ashes of more than 300 enemies are buried inside. Today, standing in front of the martyrs' tombs for a long time, one wonders what these wandering souls feel, having died and having spirits. There is a memorial碑 of Commander-in-Chief Huo on the tomb, which reads:</p>
<p>The walls of Tengchong are thick and strong, surrounded by rivers, locking the borders of the Yu area and inherently dangerous. The Japanese pirates entrenched themselves for two years, densely defending it, with clear holes, tunnels running horizontally and vertically, and transportation fortresses with gun emplacements. Scattered like stars, our army took advantage of the air force's bombing on August 2nd, bravely climbing the city walls, advancing one after another, with the momentum of a tide, completely destroying the fortresses on the city walls, entering the urban area from three sides. The ferocious enemy continued to fight stubbornly, relying on strong fortifications and street houses, fighting inch by inch, engaging in fierce battles everywhere, with smoke obscuring the sun and rain of bullets filling the sky. Engaging in hand-to-hand combat, blood flying, it lasted for more than forty days and nights until September 10th when the enemy was completely annihilated… Our officers and soldiers, with the fearless spirit of the revolution, moved by the gratitude of the leader's virtues, endured hunger and cold, risked danger and overcame difficulties, faced death and entered life, advancing without retreat, fighting ten times and deciding ten times, pressing forward again and again, and finally being able to destroy the strongholds, sweep away the thieves, promote national prestige, reverse the battle situation, remove obstacles to international transportation, create the first victory in the counter-offensive, and make the enemy's court lament a miserable defeat, with allies praising their courage. All these glorious results of the battle are truly a gem of the revolution.</p>
<p>The battle was too great. Our counter-offensive on the Burma-Yunnan Road was not an easy task. Some people say that we have not fought the enemy for eight years. I wonder what new thoughts these gentlemen would have if they went to Tengchong to see it. Equally famous with Tengchong is Mr. Li Genyuan, who is from Tengchong. It is unexpected that such a great figure came from the remote area of Tengchong. He is sixty-seven years old this year, wears a cloth robe and a cloth coat, and is in very good spirits and health. The reporter felt honored to talk with him. Here are fragments of his conversation: People think I am eighty or ninety years old, but in fact, I am only in my sixties. In total, I spent eight years in Japan, sixteen years in Suzhou, and eight years in the rear during the war. In the early years of the Republic of China, I was the second division commander in Yunnan Province, only thirty years old. I opened the Tongmenghui (Revolutionary Alliance) for the first time in Japan with Prime Minister Katsura. Now, there are only six of us alive. For the sake of the revolution, Ju Juesheng once fled to my home, and my father hosted him twice. I have loved revolution since I was a child. In order to oppose the schoolteacher increasing his salary, I even sat in a detention cell in Yongchang Prefecture for a few days. This traitor Chen Zuomin, I told Gu Mozhi in Suzhou that he should have been killed long ago. When Mr. Li said the word "kill," his eyebrows still retained the vigor of his youth because Mr. Li, as a division commander, killed hundreds of people in Dali, which was recorded in the local annals. The reporter then asked: When will Mr. Li return to Suzhou? Ah! This April, perhaps! The reporter agreed to meet Mr. Li in Suzhou this April. He is a senior statesman of our country, a politician of a generation.</p>
<p>Equally famous with Li Yin Gong is Mr. Jin Tingchen, who is already ninety-seven years old this year. He can eat, walk, and live like a normal person. His house is full of descendants, and he still manages household affairs. When the enemy occupied Tengchong, the old gentleman went to Kunming. After Tengchong was recovered, he returned. Judging by this gentleman's health, living to be one hundred years old is not a problem. The reporter once talked with him and asked him the secret to longevity. He said: Eat four meals a day and have not been close to women since I was thirty years old. This proves that his innate endowment was thick and his postnatal care was good. This is the secret to longevity.</p>
<p>In just ten days, I completed my record of crossing the Nu River again. I write this to tell the old folks in Shanghai.</p>

<h3>Tens of Thousands of Refugees in Zhenjiang</h3>
<p>— This Newspaper, Zhenjiang Dispatch, 29th, Tao Tao Reports</p>
<p>Currently, the number of refugees concentrated in Zhenjiang is approximately several hundred thousand. This huge figure comes from a survey conducted by various county associations of northern Jiangsu natives living in Zhenjiang. The refugees in Zhenjiang include those from the following counties: Gaoyou, Baoying, Xinghua, Huaicheng, Huaiyin, as well as Lianshui, Siyang, and even Feng, Pei, Xiao, and Dang. Places like Yancheng, Zaoning, Dongtai, and the five major prefectures of Yangzhou, Taizhou, Tongzhou, Xuzhou, and Haizhou also contribute a portion, but the number is generally not as high as in Zhenjiang.</p>
<p>Refugees Coming in Droves, An Endless Stream</p>
<p>The current number cannot be considered final, as groups continue to arrive in an endless stream. Why are they fleeing in such desperation? Naturally, they have a compelling reason to do so. Who doesn't understand that "home is best, hardship awaits outside"? Moreover, coming here doesn't guarantee solutions or relief. In this situation, some are acting voluntarily, while others are compelled (referring to fear of being drafted). Comparatively, these two reasons are balanced in number. However, in reality, those compelled fare better because they are mostly from rural areas and can do manual labor. It's unlike the former group, primarily intellectuals, who are reluctant to shed their long gowns and cannot engage in manual labor. Truly, they are "useless scholars."</p>
<p>Morning Prayers to Zhang Liang, Evening Prayers to Han Xin</p>
<p>Early in the morning, they are busy buying large pancakes. By noon and evening, they are preoccupied with how to get a meal. Small eateries announce they are full. It's pitiful that those who once lived in comfort now share tables with laborers and peddlers. As for lodging, those with connections force their way into accommodations because they cannot afford inns. Some refugees, having no relatives, band together to "live in temples." Although they must pay rent, it's more affordable than renting a house. When they have free time, besides wandering the streets, they are busy writing letters or filling out resumes, "praying to Zhang Liang, worshipping Han Xin," hoping to find a place to settle. In this situation, they are undoubtedly sharing the same plight. There are countless stories of heroism and tragedy. What they fear most is falling ill. However, it seems Heaven is pushing them along a slippery path. Since the beginning of spring, it has been mostly overcast and rainy. Often, they are soaked to the bone for a single meal. Beset by internal worries and external attacks, their bodies are not made of iron. Few can avoid appearing gaunt and haggard. Enduring such suffering and inhuman conditions, why don't they simply go back home?</p>
<p>Three-Category Struggle, Continuing Until Depleted</p>
<p>What is the situation back home? According to those who have come, they are engaged in mutual harassment, conducting a "three-category struggle."</p>
<p>What is the "three-category struggle"? The first is "assets." Anyone with assets is targeted for struggle until they are completely depleted. The second is "reputation." Anyone with a slight reputation is eligible for struggle. The third is "qualifications," presumably referring to past service. If the individuals in these three categories flee, their families are targeted. Twenty percent of the proceeds from the struggle go to the combatants, and the rest is confiscated. The families of those who flee are all labeled as fugitives, expelled, and their property confiscated. Covertly, the masses are incited to harass each other. Struggle committees are dispatched to various counties to implement this policy, enacting the tragedy of "one family crying is better than an entire road crying." With such conditions at home, who dares to say "I shall return"? They can only resign themselves to their fate, figuring things out as they go. But one cannot live on what one has forever, especially when one has nothing.</p>
<p>Ironclad Facts, Blood-Stained Documents</p>
<p>The associations of northern Jiangsu natives living in Zhenjiang, recognizing the grave situation if this continues, have jointly appealed in writing, stained with blood, to the Central Government, the Provincial Government, and the Su-Ning Branch of the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, requesting assistance. The original document states: "The relief work guidelines of the Su-Ning Branch of the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration prioritize the elderly, the weak, and the disabled. Future relief efforts will be implemented according to this standard. While this standard is truly perfect in areas where military and political orders are unified and follows a consistent and unchanging method, what is the actual situation in northern Jiangsu today? Northern Jiangsu counties have long been occupied by bandits, who use them as their nests. They wield military power, behaving entirely like bandits. They are politically independent, creating a separatist situation. They spare no effort in capturing landlords, gentry, intellectuals, young men and women, etc., determined to assimilate them without exception. If persuasion fails, they resort to threats. If threats are ineffective, they impose blockades. If blockades fail, they inflict punishment.</p>
<p>Eliminate Struggle, Relieve the Refugees</p>
<p>"Consequently, the people of northern Jiangsu are trapped in dire straits, unable to escape. They willingly abandon their homes and livelihoods, fleeing en masse. Parents, siblings, wives, and children are scattered, each fending for themselves. Often, they flee under the moonlight, mostly escaping in the dead of night, with nothing but the clothes on their backs. Many walk barefoot and hungry. They are not without property, but they cannot carry it. Even if they have counterfeit currency, it is unusable in other places. Moreover, after they flee, their families are isolated, unable to provide assistance. Barely escaping the clutches of the bandits, they face exposure and hardship. The misery of their inhuman lives is no different from that of the elderly, weak, and disabled. However, their determination to hate the bandits and their fervor to trust the government surpass even theirs. Therefore, based on morality, hardship, and urgency, relieving these refugees is the most pressing task. It is like a family whose children suffer unexpected misfortune due to their love for their parents and siblings. The parents and siblings would naturally feel profound pity and concern. The current situation of the refugees is like that of the children, and the position of the government is like that of the parents and siblings. Considering that these refugees came for the sake of their principles, whether they receive relief or not, they have no complaints or demands. However, there is a fear that if they are not provided with continued assistance during this difficult and perilous time at the beginning of national recovery, the lives of the refugees will be at stake, and the people's sentiments will be affected. We believe that the wise and benevolent government officials will recognize this and not blame the urgency of our words. As representatives, our responsibilities and obligations are undeniable. Having knowledge of this, we dare not remain silent. Having spoken, we dare not withhold anything. Therefore, we jointly submit this petition, presenting the plight on their behalf, hoping that it will be reviewed and approved. We request that the refugees from various northern Jiangsu counties who have fled from the bandits be designated as an important target for relief, to be provided with continuous assistance, to cultivate the nation's strength, and to stabilize the people's hearts, which is truly what we rely on."</p>
<p>Six Requests, Hoping for Resolution</p>
<p>In addition to this petition, there are six requests to be fulfilled according to regulations: 1. Request that the actual situation in northern Jiangsu be reported to the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, which will then explain to the Allied nations the need to change the established relief guidelines, focusing on the current urgent needs of the northern Jiangsu refugees. 2. Request that a fixed amount of flour be distributed to the refugees each month. 3. Request the distribution of clothing. 4. Request the establishment of temporary clinics in Zhenjiang, Yangzhou, Taizhou, Tongzhou, Xuzhou, and Haizhou to provide widespread medical treatment to the refugees. 5. Request that continued relief be provided to the ongoing stream of refugees from various counties in the spring, after the winter relief has ended, to provide assistance. 6. Request that the original allocation of three bags of flour for each adult and one and a half bags for each child during the three-month winter relief period be fulfilled. In reality, only 14 catties were received by adults and 7 catties by children in the first phase. In the second phase, adults received 28 catties, and children received 14 catties, totaling only 42 catties for adults, less than one bag, and 20 catties for children, less than half a bag. Only one-third of the original amount was received. Please reallocate the remaining flour according to the original regulations.</p>
<h3>Fifteenth Session of the Political Consultative Conference Passes Resolution on Education Report</h3>
<p>During the fifteenth session of the Political Consultative Conference on the 30th, a resolution on the education report was passed. The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>The members of this conference, having read the work report of the Ministry of Education, note that the Ministry has established a second five-year plan for national education, aiming to ensure its widespread implementation. For secondary education, the Ministry intends to establish secondary normal schools and vocational schools in proportion, aiming for balanced development. For higher education, the Ministry is paying attention to the geographical distribution of specialized schools and above, aiming to avoid favoring one region. This demonstrates the meticulous planning of the education authorities. We respectfully present the following observations after reading the report:</p>
<p>(A) National Education</p>
<p>(1) The universalization of national education cannot be achieved overnight. Parents and elder brothers of school-age children do not wish their children to be excluded from education. However, in extremely poor families, children must work to support their clothing and food. Wu Xun is a prime example of this. In the future, at least the existing budget of 10.6 billion yuan for public expenses should be maintained. Furthermore, in accordance with Dr. Sun Yat-sen's "Local Autonomy Begins" law, extremely poor students should be provided with books, meals, clothing, and other expenses so that the plan to universalize national education within five years can be truly realized. This matter should be planned for as soon as possible.</p>
<p>(2) Regarding the treatment of primary school teachers, the report states, "It has been stipulated in the revised Regulations on the Appointment, Treatment Guarantee, and Further Education of National School Teachers and Staff that the standard should be three times the cost of food, clothing, and shelter for an individual in the local area." If this can be done, it will surely allow teachers to focus on teaching. However, according to what we know, very few teachers and staff today can maintain even their most basic living expenses, let alone three times that amount. We hope that this can be remedied as soon as possible so that the goal of three times the amount does not become an empty promise.</p>
<p>(3) Currently, textbooks are nationally mandated, and external editing is not allowed. The textbooks that are compiled are not necessarily better than those previously vetted by merchants. Furthermore, the supply is often delayed, causing children nationwide to be without books to read. This method should be abolished immediately. However, bookstores should be allowed to temporarily print pre-war textbooks that have been vetted. Afterwards, they should still be allowed to openly compete, with vetting by the Ministry, to ensure quality.</p>
<p>(4) Currently, textbooks are printed by seven major bookstores. This is acceptable in areas with convenient transportation, but in remote provinces, the seven major bookstores may not have branches, or their distribution network may not reach those areas. We believe that this should be opened up so that the education bureau and bookstores can also reprint textbooks.</p>
<p>(5) Mass education centers, adult supplementary education, etc., should mobilize the power of the masses to promote education. If officials continue to promote education and the baojia system continues to handle it, it will be ineffective. The Ministry of Education should draft new methods.</p>
<p>(B) Secondary Education</p>
<p>(1) According to the Ministry of Education's recent statistics, there are 769 secondary schools nationwide with 802,163 students, and 498 normal schools with 130,995 students. The number of normal school students is much smaller than that of secondary school students. However, the report states that it aims to increase the number of normal school students by 500,000 within five years. This is likely to be difficult to achieve. It seems appropriate to add normal school departments to secondary schools as much as possible to ensure that the needs of national education for teachers are met.</p>
<p>(2) Due to the destruction by enemy puppets and other troops, the books and instruments of various secondary schools have mostly disappeared. For the sake of relief, schools should be allowed to temporarily use the facilities of other schools nearby. Strict methods should be established for compensating for damage during borrowing to prevent abuses. A school with relatively little destruction should be selected as a supply center. In the provincial capitals, science experiment centers should be established to facilitate teaching. Further development should be planned when resources are abundant in the future.</p>
<p>(3) The equipment of vocational schools is of utmost importance. The state should make every effort to enrich them and establish close ties with factories to provide opportunities for practical training.</p>
<p>(4) The seriousness of youth dropping out of school is no less than during the War of Resistance. To help secondary school students, more public funding should be provided so that displaced students can be accommodated. The quota for attracting out-of-school youth stipulated by the Ministry of Education is too small. It is said that there are only 20,000 places. In reality, there are more than 10,000 out-of-school youth who have fled from a single province. Therefore, this quota should be expanded urgently.</p>
<p>(5) After the domestic economic situation stabilizes, in addition to providing public funding to normal school students and vocational school students, secondary schools can establish scholarship quotas to select outstanding students from poor families who cannot afford to attend school.</p>
<p>(C) Higher Education</p>
<p>(1) Scientific research is related to people's livelihood and national defense. In recent years, scientific progress has entered the new age of atomic energy, which is particularly astonishing. If China does not quickly seek effective methods to promote scientific research, it will not be able to meet the requirements of this new era and will forever be a backward country. Currently, advanced scientific countries spend 1% of their total national budget on scientific research each year. Only with such ample funding can ideal achievements be expected. At present, universities and research institutes in China are facing extremely difficult financial situations, which leads to a lack of talent and equipment, creating a situation of being nominally established but lacking real substance. The education authorities should urgently petition the central government to allocate 10 billion yuan of national currency for this year's scientific recovery and development expenses, and increase it year by year to reach 1% of the total national budget. (Chongqing Dispatch from the Central News Agency on the 31st, continuation to be published.)</p>
<h3>Impressions of Shanyin</h3>
<p>In the minds of outsiders, Shaoxing is not known as the ancient capital of the Yue kingdom or the hometown of literati and righteous people. Instead, it is associated with a series of familiar terms like "Shaoxing wine," "Shaoxing opera," and "Shaoxing advisors," which circulate among the common people. However, the intellectual class has a different perception. From their knowledge of history and geography, they know Shanyin, Kuaiji, the King of Yue, Lu Xun, and other more sophisticated terms. Geographically, it also holds a strategic position on the Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway.</p>
<p>Stinking Ditches, Garbage Piles</p>
<p>In our imagination, Shaoxing is a modern, elegant Jiangnan city. However, imagination and reality are often separated by a vast distance. After arriving in Shaoxing, my first impression was: boats traveling in stinking ditches, open-air toilets on both banks, and garbage piles displayed very publicly, standing like small mountains on the roadside. Apart from one or two roads that look relatively decent on the outside, the rest are houses and streets as filthy and dirty as stinking ditches and garbage piles. Another impression is the presence of thin and impoverished children on the streets and alleys, extending their dreadful hands to beg. There are also elderly women unable to make a living, emitting miserable cries of hunger and cold in the biting north wind.</p>
<p>Yue King's Terrace, Broken Tiles</p>
<p>From the Yue King's Terrace, one can get a bird's-eye view of the entire city and the scenery of the suburbs. The houses in the city are irregular buildings. In the suburbs, the crisscrossing rivers, intersecting fields, undulating hills, interwoven lakes, and extended villages give this Jiangnan suburb a splendid new look.</p>
<p>Adjacent to the Yue King's Terrace, a pile of dilapidated tiles and rubble from a distant age remains. Although there are no signs indicating that this was the palace of the King of Yue, we can determine from the towering city walls and magnificent foundations that this was once the place where Goujian tasted bitterness and endured hardship. We cannot help but feel infinite admiration for this man who fostered growth, taught lessons, and sought revenge and redemption.</p>
<p>Wind and Rain Pavilion, Remembering the Female Knight-Errant</p>
<p>Opposite the Yue King's Terrace, on the hillside, there is a hexagonal pavilion that has been damaged.</p>
<p>From the couplet above, "Twenty years of green blood, return my rivers and mountains, thinking of the past"; "A corner of a solitary pavilion, melancholy people in the wind and rain send poetic souls!", we can determine that this is the Wind and Rain Pavilion built to commemorate Qiu Jin. The monument to the female knight-errant Qiu Jin is located in Xuantingkou in the city. It is said that this is where the outstanding woman died on June 5th, five years before the revolutionary era. Recalling the hardships of the revolutionary creation, how can we not dedicate a little effort to nation-building?</p>
<p>Lu Xun Town, Empty Sign</p>
<p>Lu Xun's home is a curiosity in Shaoxing. We also made a visit. It is said that it is now the local court. We lingered in "Three Flavors Study" for a long time. Unexpectedly, in the hometown of a great literary figure, it is impossible to find anything worth commemorating. Although there is also an empty sign for Lu Xun Town, it is so empty!</p>
<p>Shaoxing Wine, Local Opera</p>
<p>Why is Shaoxing wine so famous? According to local friends, it is because the water from the Shanyin River has a unique taste. Shaoxing winemakers cannot brew wine like this elsewhere. If you don't believe it, you can compare the water from Shanyin and Kuaiji. Unfortunately, we didn't have time to do such an experiment.</p>
<p>The several opera troupes in Shaoxing City do not seem to have as many Shaoxing opera roles as those from other places. The antiquity of the stage and the simplicity of the equipment almost make us unable to believe that this is the entertainment venue of a modern city.</p>
<p>Bagua City, Many Scholars</p>
<p>As for Shaoxing advisors, that is a product of the past. However, it is undeniable that the number of talented people in Shaoxing, especially literati, is simply impossible to calculate. It is said that this is also because Shaoxing is a Bagua (Eight Trigrams) city, which is naturally close to superstition and not believable.</p>
<p>What makes people feel extremely emotional is that other countries are making atomic bombs, while most residents of Shaoxing are still making tin foil.</p>
<p>Shaoxing City now has six towns. The names of the towns are prefixed with the names of modern celebrities such as Tang Gong, Cheng Zhang, Xi Lin, Qiu Jin, Yuan Pei, and Lu Xun. It is said that the population is 250,000. However, there are many poor and desperate characters like Ah Q, Old Shuan, Runtu, Kong Yiji, Hua Da Ma, Xianglin's Wife, and Aunt Shan Si, pursuing light and longing for happiness. I extend my most sincere blessings to them!</p>
<p>This Newspaper, Shaoxing Dispatch, Mao Yingpeng Sent from Shaoxing on the 27th</p>
<h3>Central Anhui Construction: The First Sound. Repairing Over Two Hundred Li of River Embankments, Mobilizing a Total of Three Million Laborers, Adopting a Competitive Approach to the Work</h3>
<p>The Wuwei County river embankment, extending from Qinggang Temple in the north to Tangjiawan in the south, spans over two hundred li and serves as the lifeline for the seven counties of Shu, Lu, Wu, Chao, He, and Han. However, due to years of neglect since the War of Resistance, the area near Gujia Mill has been eroded by the river current, leading to the collapse of the embankment foot and cracks in the embankment body, threatening its collapse. After the Wuwei County government moved its offices to the county town, County Magistrate You and local gentry, recognizing the danger of the embankment, submitted a proposal to the provincial government to establish a County Embankment Workers' Union to handle the embankment repair work. They also consulted with water conservancy experts and inspected the embankment carefully. Furthermore, the Provincial Water Conservancy Department and the Anhui Relief Branch successively sent personnel for on-site surveys, estimating a total soil requirement of over 1.76 million cubic meters, with a completion deadline set for April 26th. To ensure the solidity of the project and its completion on schedule, a General Embankment Works Office was established at Tangjiagou, in coordination with the Supervision Team stationed by the Tang Branch Office. The entire embankment was divided into six sections: Zhanjia Mill, Yaojiagou, Niwen, Xinba, Wangci, and Jiji, each with an Embankment Works Office to cooperate with the Supervision Team, supply station, and flour station in supervising embankment work, verifying quantities, and distributing flour. Medical clinics were also established in Tanggou, Xinba, and Gujia Mill, fully equipped. The regulations for conscripting laborers, distributing work relief flour, and rewards and punishments are recorded below:</p>
<p>(A) Labor Conscription: (1) Beneficiary Laborers. For official embankments: one conscripted laborer plus one additional laborer, totaling two laborers. For private embankments: one conscripted laborer plus two additional laborers, totaling three laborers. (2) Obligatory Laborers: 220 laborers from each township (exempting townships outside the river embankment, but not those on the embankment surface). The county government will dispatch personnel to supervise and verify the work.</p>
<p>(B) Organization: (1) Official Embankments: For the allotted laborers, each village elects one person to be the company commander and one person to be the company deputy commander. The current year's village head serves as the platoon leader, and the allotted laborers elect one person to be the platoon deputy commander. (2) Private Embankments: The current year's village head serves as the platoon leader, and the allotted laborers elect one person to be the platoon deputy commander. (3) Obligatory Laborers: Each township establishes a company, with the township head as the company commander. Each bao establishes a platoon, with the bao head as the platoon leader. Each jia establishes a squad, with the jia head as the squad leader. (4) Company and platoon deputy commanders are to be filled by impartial local individuals recommended by each township and bao. (5) The county establishes an Engineering General Team, with the county magistrate concurrently serving as the general team commander. The district establishes a brigade, with the district head as the brigade commander. All company and platoon units of beneficiary and obligatory laborers, according to the original administrative divisions, are to be commanded and managed by the brigade commander under the orders of the general team commander.</p>
<p>(C) Equipment: (1) Each laborer is to bring their own lodging shelter, cooking utensils for salt, oil, firewood, and vegetables, and prepare twenty days' worth of rice to cover their food. (2) Every ten laborers are to bring eight bamboo baskets and four hoes. (3) Each platoon is to prepare two red cloth flags, to be erected at both ends of the work area during construction for starting, eating, and dismissing laborers.</p>
<p>(D) Work Relief: (1) The Anhui Relief Branch will provide one jin of flour per cubic meter. Every five days, the platoon deputy commander will prepare a register of laborers' fingerprints based on the volume of earthwork estimated by the branch office and directly collect and distribute the flour from the designated distribution point. (2) The Anhui Branch will directly pay for the transportation costs of the flour from the waterway to the distribution point. (3) The method of implementation will be based on the volume of earthwork measured by the Anhui Branch. The county will divide the construction sections based on the number of laborers in the company or platoon, set up marker posts, and construct according to the specifications. Any instances of underreporting quantities or using inferior soil will be severely punished.</p>
<p>(E) Rewards and Punishments: (1) The current embankment repair will adopt a competitive approach, with the county government providing rewards and punishments based on performance. (2) Staff at all levels with excellent performance will be awarded flags, medals, and reported to the province for preferential commendation. (3) Laborers with excellent performance will be awarded certificates by the county government. (4) Staff at all levels who are ineffective in their work, as well as laborers who are negligent, will be severely punished by the county government in accordance with the reward and punishment measures promulgated by the higher authorities.</p>

<h3>On the Lock of Fame and the Tether of Profit</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>In the past, some ladies in our country who had a detached outlook and did not covet fame and fortune used the phrase "the lock of fame and the tether of profit" to describe the prison and fetters that fame and profit imposed on a person. They wanted us to break free from the constraints of fame and profit.</p>
<p>Striving for fame and greed for profit are very bad for both society and the individual. Those who blindly pursue fame sometimes only know to follow trends for the sake of reputation, valuing vanity over practicality and favoring superficial embellishments over actual achievements. It is even worse when people engage in infighting to compete for fame or deprive others of their benefits. In society, there are many people who admire false reputations and do not work hard in their own actual work. They only know to spend their days running around the homes of the powerful and entering the gates of the prominent, fearing to be behind others in currying favor and meticulously planning their path to advancement. Such people are not only harmful to society but also waste their energy for nothing. Because fame and reality are inherently linked, even if one believes they have gained a considerable social status without practical work performance, it can only be described as a false reputation, not a true one. Genuine reputation cannot be obtained by force. Reputation gained through seeking fame and fishing for praise is not reputation but rather a disgrace. Plato said, "Accepting fame that we do not deserve only defiles our character." Those who are frantic for fame and do not pursue practicality actually destroy their own reputation first!</p>
<p>As for profit, that is something everyone desires. In society, countless people have caused disputes due to greed for profit. The harmony between individuals has been destroyed by this word "profit," and the entire society has become chaotic, making it impossible for everyone to live in peace. If the trend of speculation and hoarding is not stopped, then social order cannot be stabilized for a day, and national morality cannot be improved for a day. The emergence of selfishness stems from "self-interest." Because of self-interest, one naturally disregards the interests of others and does not adopt legitimate methods of earning profit. One is intent on hoarding and speculating, oppressing others, and being oppressed by others. If I have goods in hand, I can win over you. If I have money in hand, I am a living god of wealth, ignoring everything else. In this way, I exploit you, and you exploit me. Whoever has the goods wins, and whoever has the money has the means. This is truly what Mencius said: "When superiors and inferiors contend for profit, the state is in danger!"</p>
<p>Seeking fame and seeking profit seem to be two different things, but in reality, there is also a close connection between them. Purely seeking fame or purely seeking profit is actually rare. Seeking fame originally carries the purpose of seeking profit. Originally, seeking fame should lead to "name and reality matching," but most people hope for "name leading to reality." Some even misunderstand the meaning of "name leading to reality," believing that "reality arriving" is another way of saying gaining profit. Furthermore, many people regard seeking fame as a means of seeking profit, believing that once they have fame, how can there not be profit to be gained? Of course, there are also some people who are obsessed with profit, calculating every penny, believing that once they have obtained profit, fame will surely follow. This is probably because high officials and generous salaries can be obtained at a considerable price. Moreover, in the minds of those "money worshippers," they believe that money can move gods, money can manipulate everything, and control everything, let alone a person's fame? But what they should consider is that true reputation is the spiritual wealth of one's own academic character, thought, and experience, obtained without seeking it. Without going through arduous labor (physical or intellectual), even if one believes they have achieved the so-called goal of "both fame and fortune," they can at most gain people's trust for a time, but will eventually fail. Moreover, false reputation cannot focus on people, and profit obtained without one's own labor cannot escape the name of theft. Profit must be obtained justly, which is a definite principle. Obtaining ill-gotten gains is really no different from theft. The loss in character and the loss in standing are far greater than the ill-gotten gains.</p>
<p>High-minded scholars who are indifferent to fame and profit have seen through the cage that fame and profit create for people (or it can be said that people cage themselves), and thus use "the lock of fame and the tether of profit" to suggest that people should not be bound by them, lest they lose their nature and cause endless troubles. Their views are naturally very correct. If we can clearly recognize fame and profit, we will certainly not be confused by the turbid "world." However, it may not be possible for a person to completely abandon the concept of fame and profit. I believe that there are very few people in the world who can truly not be bound by the lock of fame and the tether of profit. Even in the past, when human life was very simple and there was no need for you to compete with me, how many people could truly regard wealth and honor as floating clouds? The fisherman's life that Zheng Banqiao yearned for, asking us to follow along, is impossible unless time is turned back. In today's materialistic and civilized modern society, we fundamentally cannot and do not need to envy the lives of the so-called "high-minded scholars" and "recluses" of the past. But at the same time, we cannot but pursue a reasonable spiritual life, giving our souls a place of comfort. There is no need to learn from woodcutters and fishermen, and even less need to envy those ancient high-minded scholars and recluses. It is enough to have a new understanding of fame and profit.</p>
<p>According to the research of psychologists, since birth, humans have a need to satisfy desires. Some scholars say that desire is a human instinct, something that is innate. Let's leave that aside for now, but it is a fact that human desires and needs increase with the degree of growth and development. The more complex the social environment, the greater the desires and needs for life. In any case, we cannot live apart from society. Even people who live on isolated islands still have their desires and needs. If the minimum standard of living cannot be maintained, and the minimum material desires cannot be satisfied, you cannot teach people to be content with simplicity. With prices so high at present, the lives of ordinary people are extremely difficult. It is simply impossible to talk about living the tranquil and leisurely life of Tao Yuanming, "picking chrysanthemums under the eastern fence." If the rural economy is broken and social structures are shaken, no matter how much you love rural life, it will not allow your heart a single day of peace. The main reason is that the nature of ancient agricultural society and modern agricultural society has changed. As for finding a county magistrate like Tao Yuanming who "does not bow his waist for five pecks of rice," it is even more impossible.</p>
<p>We do not need to force ourselves to get rid of fame and profit, but only need to guide the concepts of fame and profit into reasonable and appropriate paths. Let's talk about fame. Liking fame and seeking fame cannot be considered bad things, only whether the pursuit is appropriate or not. The ancients said, "After the Three Dynasties, there was fear of not liking fame." Lincoln also said, "A person who truly likes fame will surely love fame and will definitely not easily tarnish his own name." It can be seen that people who truly like fame are ambitious. Based on their liking of fame, they can demonstrate their self-love and self-respect, unwilling to fall into mediocrity. Utilizing the human instinct to like fame can also stimulate a person's ambition and encourage a person's progress. However, one point must be clearly recognized: liking fame is pursuing deserved honor, not merely comparable to pursuing false reputation. People who love honor must have very high and great ideals in life, and they value the word "character" very highly. External praise, if it is truly deserved, can of course be accepted with peace of mind, but one should never listen to the flattery and adulation of the vulgar. Unless there is something in one's academics or career that deserves people's admiration, one should never be complacent about gaining a false reputation. Such a person who loves fame must be able to respect themselves and respect others. Loving fame in this way, honor is gained without seeking it, and it can be said to be beneficial to both the individual and society, truly reaching a thorough understanding of the meaning of fame.</p>
<p>Next, let's talk about profit. Seeking profit is also not a bad thing. Profit that is earned is the price of mental and physical labor, and it is a right that we should enjoy as human beings. If we blindly despise profit, not only will we not be able to obtain the necessities of life, but we will also be abandoning the rights we should enjoy. Without the ability to enjoy rights, we cannot fulfill obligations. Profit can lead people to be accustomed to selfishness, even to the point of destroying their reputation and character, or even leading to their ruin. Profit can also bring people material and spiritual comfort, improve their lives, and benefit the public and society. It all depends on how we seek profit. Just as with seeking fame, we must not seek it through improper means. We must obtain it through legitimate means, distinguishing between the true meaning of profit and righteousness, using "righteousness" as the premise for seeking profit, and earning profit according to the amount of effort exerted, without any thoughts of luck or greed. In that case, one's character will not be corrupted. One should not be complacent about achievements in academics and career, but should be content with the profit one has earned. Of course, we must also be able to maintain the minimum standard of living.</p>
<p>Society</p>
<h3>Labor-Capital Partnership</h3>
<p>— Yang Xiyao</p>
<p>In recent months, prices in this city have risen sharply, causing serious and widespread labor unrest. One wave has barely subsided before another arises, affecting almost every industry. Labor and management have taken extreme positions, and the entire society has been shaken. Although the social authorities have tried their best to mediate and resolve the situation gradually, leading to a gradual return to calm, it is difficult to be overly optimistic about future labor-management disputes, as prices are still difficult to stabilize. For example, the current wage increases have reached a level where they can maintain the livelihood of workers given the current prices, so everyone is naturally content. However, if prices continue to rise, will there be another request for wage increases after a certain period of time? It is truly unimaginable to continue like this.</p>
<p>I believe that to fundamentally resolve labor unrest, it is better to change the salary system to one where the capitalist contributes capital as shares, and the laborer contributes labor as shares. Simply put, one side contributes money shares, and the other side contributes labor shares. The surplus profits are distributed according to the corresponding proportions. In this way, if prices rise, everyone's profits will increase, so they will naturally not be affected. Once prices fall, everyone's profits will also decrease. However, when prices fall, consumption will naturally decrease as well, so they will still not be affected. Moreover, in this way, the laborer, having a personal stake in the profits, will naturally be loyal to their duties. When laborers are loyal and dedicated, the business will naturally prosper. When the business is thriving, it will naturally also benefit the capitalist. This can further promote labor-capital cooperation.</p>
<p>As for how labor and capital should cooperate, how to coordinate conditions, and how to distribute profits, the two sides must discuss these matters themselves.</p>
<p>I have no knowledge of economics and no experience in industry and commerce, so what I have expressed is naturally a one-sided ideal. I do not know if this idea is reasonable. I hope experts will discuss it and await factual proof.</p>
<h3>Pudong Temple Fair</h3>
<p>— Li Sheng</p>
<p>There are still many superstitious people in Pudong. After temporarily suspending the temple fair last year due to the bombings at Gao Temple and other places on Dongchang Road, they are planning to hold the temple fair again this spring. Although the local sub-bureau has issued public notices, how can it stop these ignorant people from believing in superstitions?</p>
<p>Although the temple fair is said to be for worshiping gods, most of it is controlled by hooligans who are fond of bravery and fighting. They hook hundred-pound incense burners onto their arms and run for several miles (resulting in many deaths). There are also obscene lyrics and ditties, such as "Eighteen Touches" and "Striking Flowers"! Does the god of heaven really love these tunes?</p>
<p>For the farmers who are planting crops, the temple fair is unlucky. Good wheat seedlings are trampled into withered grass by the people at the temple fair. The temple fair causes thousands upon thousands of men, women, and children to abandon their work, idling for several days.</p>
<p>During the temple fair, other than the monks and Taoists who are showing off the plaques of the patrons and the young punks who want to show off, no one else really benefits!</p>
<p>I hope the municipal authorities will strictly issue an order to prohibit it! Otherwise, on the one hand, it will further encourage superstition. On the other hand, after eight years of suffering and hardship for the people, if a temple fair is held, the amount of money wasted will be considerable, which will hinder the reconstruction of the region! Moreover, the temple fair is crowded, resulting in children being trampled, pickpockets and thieves, and arguments and teasing, all of which are detrimental to public order.</p>
<h3>Vacuum Blood Collection Device</h3>
<p>— Shen Shi</p>
<p>When a doctor needs to draw blood from a patient's blood vessel for diagnostic tests, they use an ordinary intravenous syringe.</p>
<p>Recently, there has been a new type of vacuum blood collection device. The form is similar to the syringes we have seen. One end has a needle with a side opening, and on the manual suction side, it has been replaced with a rubber-sealed suction head that contains an automatically aligned vacuum storage tube.</p>
<p>This type of vacuum blood collection device can draw one cubic centimeter of blood in one second, which is several times faster than ordinary ones. When the blood draw is completed, it can automatically seal, so there is no risk of spilling blood or transmitting bacteria, and there is no need to add any anticoagulant drugs. Therefore, the blood drawing procedure is much simpler and safer than with current intravenous syringes.</p>
<h3>Sympathy</h3>
<p>— Xiaoshan</p>
<p>The relationship between people is always reciprocal, not only in external "mutual assistance" but even more so in superficial "sympathy."</p>
<p>Some people think that mutual assistance is active and sympathy is passive, but this is not the case. People who are accustomed to helping others are not necessarily sympathetic to people; they may even be "unfeeling." Because without genuine sympathy, many acts of mutual assistance today fall into hypocrisy and deception.</p>
<p>People can have many external differences—status, education, lifestyle, age, race, even hobbies and interests. These can all be three-dimensional, but internally, they should be flattened out, and each other's hearts should be able to melt together at any time. But the current situation seems to be that the internal blockade is even greater than the external separation. The door to each person's heart is almost tightly closed. Some people even regard "maintaining a considerable distance" as a new form of worldly wisdom!</p>
<p>We attribute the reason for the closed heart doors not to the external separation relations but simply to the fact that people, out of some kind of fear, pride, suspicion, or just pure laziness, have abandoned their innate sympathy.</p>
<p>The one who tied the bell must untie it. Why not pick up this precious key and open the blocked heart door!</p>
<p>"Sympathy" does not mean "pity." Seeing a beggar on the brink of death, everyone will compassionately sigh. This is not enough "sympathy." On the contrary, it may be "arrogance!" Sympathy is to inject yourself and your genuine emotions into your relationship with others! It contains an unspeakable suitability, warmth, and the flavor of loveliness.</p>
<p>Sympathy is standing in the reality of others, understanding their emotions, and their goals, so that they feel a kind of practical "freshness," just like the blood that they themselves have grown.</p>
<p>Sympathy cannot be achieved simply with language and gestures, but by giving yourself to others unreservedly—genuinely giving yourself, not coldly and completely.</p>
<p>"Those who sympathize with people will receive sympathy!" Many fruits of sympathy make oneself feel an overflowing "vitality!" Because when another person's heart door opens for you, the manifestation of that "true feeling" is always shared mutually.</p>
<p>If humanity can learn internal sympathy, many formal "mutual assistance treaties" would not be habitually shattered and cease to exist.</p>
<h3>Non-Reflective Glasses</h3>
<p>— Wu Daquan</p>
<p>People who wear glasses feel that the lenses sometimes have glare, making it difficult to see clearly. Recently, there has been a remedy. That is to coat the lens with a thin film of chemical substance. Although this film cannot prevent reflection, it has the effect of making the reflections cancel each other out. A camera lens coated with this thin film, even when shooting directly into the sun, will not result in blurry negatives.</p>
<h3>Reply to Readers</h3>
<p>Wang Ming asks: The question was seen in yesterday's newspaper.</p>
<p>Dr. Zhang Zhongming replies: Your wife is suffering from cervicitis. She needs to check her blood pressure and urine, and it is best to be treated in the hospital.</p>
<p>Weng Zhen asks: (1) What is the treatment for "deep bronchial shadow"? (2) What special medicines are available?</p>
<p>Dr. Zhang Zhongming replies: There is no specific medicine for "deep bronchial shadow." It is advisable to rest, recuperate more, and calcium tablets and cough medicine can be used for symptomatic relief.</p>
<p>Jiang Wenbin asks: I am thirty-four years old this year. When I was twenty-three, I suffered from hemoptysis. At the age of thirty, the disease relapsed, and my constitution gradually weakened. The following autumn, after an X-ray examination, there were spots on both sides of the lungs, with the right side being more severe. According to the doctor, it is chronic pulmonary tuberculosis and there is no radical cure. I now request several points: (1) Is the special American medicine for lung disease "Streptomycin" or is there another medicine? (2) When will Chinese people have the opportunity to enjoy it? (3) In your opinion, Dr., what is the best method of treatment for my illness?</p>
<p>Dr. Zhang Zhongming replies: There are many rumors about special American medicines for lung disease, but there are no documents in formal medical journals. If there are any, they only describe the experimental procedures in the experimental airspace and the effects of the theory. Therefore, you do not yet have the opportunity to enjoy it. Your condition must be first photographed with a Cox-light film or viewed with fluoroscopy before a decision can be made.</p>
<p>Shen Luchang asks: I am thirty-four years old this year and have suffered from premature ejaculation for fifteen or sixteen years. My body is weak. I have the following three points and would like to request a reply: (1) Is there any medicine that can cure this disease, and where can I buy it? (2) Is hospitalization effective, and how many days will it take? (3) Is the potency of the Prabha advertised in your newspaper reliable?</p>
<p>Dr. Zhang Zhongming replies: (1) Taking nerve sedatives or phospholipid brain supplements is effective. (2) If you can calm your mind and recuperate yourself, you do not need to be hospitalized. (3) I am sorry that I cannot casually recommend medicines advertised in the newspaper.</p>
