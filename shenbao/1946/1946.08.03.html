<h3>馬帥今日再赴蘆山　昨訪宋院長並晤俞大維　商談重點移至安平事件</h3>
<p>〔本報南京二日電〕馬歇爾特使今日繼續處理在華美軍諸問題，上午十時，曾與美籍軍官三人晤談，十時四十分離去，十一時，馬帥單獨乘車往訪宋院長，晤談甚久，並同進午餐，迄午後四時始出，談話內容不悉。茲聞馬帥有明日與宋院長同飛牯嶺之說。又本日下午六時，兪大維曾應約往訪馬帥，談半小時即出。馬師將於明日下午赴牯嶺，行前可能再邀約周恩來晤談，然對國共商談一事，顯無進展。據某氏稱：共產黨堅不讓步，談判即無法進行，故目前欲使商談之門重啓，必須有新的意見，就此情勢觀之，今昨兩日之馬帥與各人之接談，屬於國共商談者少，其重點實已移轉至「安平」事件矣。</p>
<p>〔本報牯嶺二日電〕聞馬歇爾特使明日將與宋院長同來蘆山。又司徒大使昨晚於主席行轅返館時，因天寒受凉，又感不適，故中午仍臥床休息。柯克去訪時，其醫官曾表示大使三日內仍不擬返京。</p>
<p>〔中央社牯嶺二日電〕司徒雷登大使，二日繼續搜集美海軍陸戰隊在平津公路被襲事件之有關資料，期能迅速澈底明暸其眞像，大使對此事之處理，極力避免感情用事，頭腦異常冷靜，馬帥日內即將由京再來牯，傳與處理此事有關。</p>
<p>〔中央社牯嶺二日電〕美駐華艦隊總司令柯克上將，二日晨十時赴行轅晋謁蔣主席，作到牯後之首次正式拜會，歷四十分鐘辭出，繼訪司徒雷登大使於其旅邸，將美海軍陸戰隊在平津公路被襲擊事件商談約半小時，正午由黄總幹事仁霖導遊仙人洞，柯克夫人及男女公子亦參加，遊罷復至河東路勵志社游泳池游泳，晚八時半應蔣主席夫婦邀，携眷屬參加行轅茶會，馬歇爾夫人，國府宣傳顧問貝爾，中宣部彭部長亦奉邀作陪，十時始散。</p>
<h3>主席對國內紛爭有政治解決辦法　彭部長在牯對記者談話</h3>
<p>〔中央社牯嶺二日電〕中宣部長彭學沛，二日晚八時偕貝爾顧問赴行轅，晋謁蔣主席。</p>
<p>〔又電〕彭學沛二在牯嶺記者公宴會中發表簡短談話，車最多祇需十分鐘，坐電車則需三分鐘，可見中國事情因條件不具備，往往要慢一點。中國內部紛爭，一定要解決，要快解決。解決國內紛爭，沒有人比政府還急，沒有人比蔣主席更急，但是總需要一點時間，蔣主席已經解決了中國的軍阀問題，又已經解決了日本侵略的問題，他定能够解決國內的紛爭問題，我曉得他有了一個辦法，而且曉得是一個政治解決的辦法，他是一個知道病人的習慣和歷史的醫生，我們應該要給他一點時間。今日貝爾顧問，陶希聖·盧祺新·曾漢光及美國生活時代雜誌記者席爾，均被邀請，作東之記者爲中央社及京·滬·漢·赣十八家報館特派員。</p>
<h3>軍調部小組今日出發　調查美軍被襲案　高松元等視察結果謂係預謀行動</h3>
<p>〔本報北平二日電〕（一）軍調部廿五小組，定三日出發香河縣安平鎭，調查美軍被襲事，政府代表爲呂能定·共黨雷任江·美方代表亞力山大。（二）爲美軍安平鎮被襲事，雖係共軍肇事，地方當局亦有責任，聞此間當局將向美軍道歉。</p>
<p>〔本報北平二日電〕十一戰區副參謀長高松元，偕河北省第五區專員黄任材，奉李宗仁主任命，赴平津公路大小沙河視察美軍被襲地點，二日下午三時歸來，據云：此行視察結果，謂係有計劃行動，當局即根據此行調查結果報告蔣主席，高氏等係一日下午六時出發，首赴大小沙河西方之馬頭鎮，因國軍尚未進至大小沙河，遂宿於馬頭鎭，二日晨始隨軍前進，在大小沙河逗留二小時，由當地居民口中得悉，共軍預知美軍通過，本擬在安平刦擊，但經安平村民之跪哭請求，乃改在大小沙河。因該地地勢宜於伏擊，並預將經過該路之牛車兩輛扣留，横置路旁，用作障礙物，美軍到時，驟然開槍，美軍卒不及防，乃有傷亡。根據此種經過判斷，可知共軍此舉預有計劃，據村民目擊者談：是役共軍傷亡慘重，除以大車運回香河城內，傷亡官兵六十餘人外，埋於當地者數十人云云，十一戰區長官部將根據調查所得，有所聲明。</p>
<h3>被襲殞命美兵昨日在津安葬</h3>
<p>張市長等親往弔唁</p>
<p>〔合衆社北平二日電〕美陸戰隊當局宣布：星期一被襲美陸戰隊員，今晨又死一人，計亡死已達四人，同時據確悉，國府爲美兵被襲事，已決定向平軍調部共方代表提出兩項要求，（一）所有施行伏擊美陸戰隊之人員，應交與政府審訊，（二）立即向陸戰隊死者及其家屬致送賠償金。報載美當局爲被襲事，已向共方提出抗議。</p>
<p>〔中央社天津二日電〕平津公路安平附近被共軍襲擊而死亡之美海軍陸戰隊官兵三名，二日安葬於津東局子美國公墓，美軍舉行追悼會時，津市長張廷諤，九十四軍軍長牟廷芳等，均親往弔唁。</p>
<h3>共黨將在華北繼續反美運動</h3>
<p>解放日報又著謬論</p>
<p>〔聯合社北平二日電〕美國今日接到警告，預料華北反美運動將繼續發生，與七月廿九日之美兵中伏案及半月前之美兵七名被綁案性質相同。共黨方面對該兩案業已承認，但關於前一案，共黨指責美軍與國軍並肩攻擊「八路軍」，同時美軍方面仍不願正式確認襲擊美軍者爲共黨部隊。又悉延安方面曾令華北共軍與美軍發生衝突，並動員美軍駐紮區域之人民發起反美運動，其用意乃在造成意外事件，迫使美軍退出中國。</p>
<p>〔合衆社北平二日電〕據延安電：中共機關報解放日報，本日著論評美陸戰隊被襲事，要求美軍自華撤退，認爲此乃解決目前時局糾紛之「基礎」。該報並謂：「吾人更應要求天津美陸戰隊道歉，懲罰負責官佐，並公開保證不致攻繫或擾亂「解放區」。」</p>
<h3>共黨發言人稱目前局勢嚴重</h3>
<p>〔本報南京二日電〕華北安平共軍襲繫美軍一事發生後，各方均極注意，頃據共產黨代表團稱：共產黨現已獲有報告，（一）已確定爲美國武裝巡邏隊，（二）安平屬解放區，（三）雙方確曾發生「衝突」，頃周恩來已電囑葉劍英派特別小組前往調查，以便追究責任。據某觀察家稱：此事或為故意製造者，然做得太不聰明，致使目前局勢趨於嚴重。</p>
<p>〔路透社南京二日電〕共黨發言人王炳南昨夜於周恩來與馬歇爾「廣泛交換意見」三小時後，申稱：「目前時機極爲重要，」繼謂：馬周會談雖屬一般性質，但涉及美軍之安平事件，亦未「特別」加以考慮，吾人尚未接獲衝突之報告，但感覺此爲不愉快事件，吾人刻已建議派一特別小組前往調查。關於馬歇爾曾否自牯嶺携歸任何具體建議一項詢問，王炳南答曰：「尚無確定之議，吾人現在等候司徒雷登大使，此時評論司徒雷登將否携來停止衝突及打開政治談判僵局之折衷建議，則尚嫌過早。」王炳南未談及「重要時機」一語曰：「倘各項問題能獲解決，則中國可得和平，倘不獲解決，則內戰將益擴大而嚴重。」</p>
<h3>平行轅發言人駁斥延安廣播</h3>
<p>〔中央社北平二日電〕北平行轅發言人，二日鄭重否認延安廣播所稱國軍八十名曾於七月二十九日晨聯同美陸戰隊士兵六十名進攻共軍之消息，發言人指稱，此項廣播純係無稽濫言，且爲最卑劣惡意之宣傳。</p>
<h3>第九小組返漢　昨乘原機飛陜</h3>
<p>〔本報漢口二日電〕第九小組政府代表盧濟時少將，美方代表何柱堅上校，共方代表薛子正少將，及翻譯電訊人員等一行十餘人，於昨日下午二時自老河口乘美專機返抵漢，定今午乘原機飛西安。</p>
<h3>白部長昨飛豫檢閱駐軍</h3>
<p>〔本報南京二日電〕國防部白部長崇禧，今晨十時專機飛豫新鄕，檢閱軍隊，偕行者有隨員六七人。</p>
<h3>潘光旦等抵京</h3>
<p>顧祝同今昆市長</p>
<p>慰問李聞兩家屬</p>
<p>〔本報南京二日電〕於昆明李聞被刺後曾避入昆美領館之潘光旦，費孝道兩敎授，二日由渝飛抵京，同來者有敎部派赴昆明慰唁聞一多家屬之劉參事英士，記者曾訪晤潘費兩氏，潘氏稱：余等乃一敎授，性近敎育，故亟不欲轉入政治漩渦，對李聞被刺之事，不願發表任何談話，僅稱：願待政府處理，彼等在京僅作數日勾留，即將北飛赴淸華執敎。</p>
<p>〔中央社昆明二日電〕顧總司令祝同，二日命昆市長曾恕懷，慰問李公樸，聞一多兩家屬，幷詳詢被刺經過情形。</p>

<h3>蘇北國軍迫近海安　魯共軍南下增援　揚天公路交通即可恢復</h3>
<p>〔本報南京二日電〕軍息，蘇北前綫，戰事沉寂，但共軍調遣頻繁，顯示大規模之軍事攻勢，不日將於揚，泰，台，如，以及隴海東段宿遷東北展開。共軍現由魯省調來大批援軍，穿越隴海綫，進抵沭陽，準備北園東海，南攻宿遷，一部份援軍直達淮陰，沿運河南下，至汜水附近登岸，指向臨澤，沿臨興（化）公路開抵東台，企圖挽救海安危局。揚泰公路附近少數共軍，企圖蠢動，國軍在密切注視中。通如公路通車情况良好，揚州儀徴公路，國軍在日夜搶修中。揚州至天長公路附近，共軍已漸肅淸，軍用卡車已可行駛於揚天之間。總觀蘇北局勢，仍屬異常混亂。據軍方某觀察家謂，二月之內，蘇北之局勢，可望澄淸，此間蘇北難民，已紛作返鄕之準備。</p>
<p>〔本報江都二日電〕揚城國軍今沿揚天公路出擊，於下午一時克復甘泉山·甘泉集·方家巷等據點，同時天長國軍，亦相繼出擊，刻已進駐化和集。共軍爲阻擾國軍，恢復揚天公路交通，頃自高郵方面，調動三師兵力，至菱塘橋一帶騷擾，國軍已進行驅逐，決於短期內，恢復該路交通</p>
<p>〔本報江都二日電〕進至黎城鎭蔣家壩一綫國軍，現作緩緩推進，兩側共軍殘部，亟待肅淸。</p>
<p>〔中央社徐州二日電〕共軍於一日復增援向徐州東南外圍地區猛犯，戰鬥正烈。</p>
<h3>參議員惠勒斥國務院　美何以支持中共？　實非中國人民所能了解</h3>
<p>〔本報紐約特派員毛樹淸一日專電〕內勃拉斯加州參議員惠勒，今日在參議院中發出警告稱：「美國對南斯拉夫等極權國家貸給鉅額借款，而對於盟邦之中國則靳而不予，此中原因，實非覺醒之中國人民所能了解者。」惠勒攻擊美國外交政策之錯誤，該項政策足以促成第三次世界大戰。渠稱：「國務院支持中國共產黨，直接與蘇聯有利。蘇聯已成世界和平及世界安全之眞正威脅，吾人在美國外交人員之領導下，正向原子戰爭之途中前進。」惠勒於指陳穌聯侵入東歐之局勢後宣稱：史達林與羅斯福簽訂之雅爾達協定，將中國人民出賣於共產黨，同時並出賣美國在遠東之重大利益。惠勒要求參議院詳細調查中國事件，謂蘇聯在密約護衛下，公然刧掠東北財產，中國遂分裂而爲二。惠勒批評稱：「社魯門總統似相信共產黨之參加中國政府可使其成爲所謂「民主」政府，而吾人則視共產黨為極權主義者，其故安在？」惠勒復將美國政府及中國政府加以此較稱：「何以美國政府主張共產黨參加中國政府，而國會委負會及司法部則竭力阻止共產黨參加美國政府？何以杜魯門相信中國共產黨爲民主主義者及農業改革家，而吾人則視美國共產黨効忠於外國政府？何以杜魯門並不堅持共產黨應開放其佔領區，以便恢復交通，拯救數百萬饥民？何以聯總對華援助數量有限，而美國給予蘇聯附庸國甚至以前敵國之援助則殊爲豐厚？」</p>
<h3>蔡文治發表聲明　共黨目的圖迫美軍撤退　再在華北發動全面內戰</h3>
<p>〔本報北平二日電〕軍調部政府參議長蔡文治，今日爲美軍七月廿九日在安平鎮附近被襲事發表聲明，認爲共軍此舉係欲逼迫美軍撤退，並欲於美軍撤退後，在華北各省發動全面內戰，原聲明大要如次：（一）共黨已承認係共軍襲擊。（二）共產黨所謂美軍進入解放區，國軍協同前往一節，純係造謠抵賴，該地爲平津公路，美軍輸運給養，每三日一次，均有車輛往來，並非所謂解放區。（三）美軍經常由津向平輸運執行部美方人員及駐平陸戰隊之給養，何來國軍隨同，共軍潛入公路區，事先於公路上設置障礙物，布置伏兵，此事出自預謀。（四）共黨謂當日有國軍隨行，如然，則國軍方面應有準備，何以事出倉卒，美軍傷亡如此之多，國軍並無傷亡，共黨所云，顯係殺人後反行誣賴。（五）美軍北戴河被綁後十日，又發生安平鎭美軍被襲擊案，顯係共產黨最高當局預謀。（六）美軍駐防中國，恊助遺俘，並不侵害我主權。</p>
<h3>政工改制問題已有初步決定</h3>

<h3>東京日警槍擊台胞　慘案之經過詳情　駐日佔領軍司令派員調查後　李伯鈞廖季威返國發表報吿</h3>
<p>〔本市訊〕七月十九日車京　谷　署門前，發生日警槍殺台僑五名，輕重傷十八名慘案，我駐日佔領軍司令部外事組李伯鈞，廖季威奉命調查，已將該案前因後果及經過情形，調查淸楚，李伯鈞日昨返國抵滬，據其發表調查報吿大要如下：</p>
<p>先是七月十四日下午三時，有台僑張育勳由新橋斷途中，忽遇日本流氓用短刀將其顎部剌傷，渠乃至松田組請交出犯人，以該組不肯交出，乃於十五日前往愛宕警署作同樣中訴，該警署亦未受理，張遂憤怒返家，七月十六日下午左右，新橋方面醫集日方流氓約數百名，對新橋露天商店台僑百餘名襲擊，時台僑中見來勢不佳，乃奔至東京華僑聯合總會，請會長急來調停，巴禮桂會長聞訊，即往新橋當塲調停，逎自陳會長去後，約在下午三時左右，又有日方流氓約十名，手持有日本刀·木棍·　子等武器，馳往台僑　販尋　，台僑為自衛計，曾將日方所持武器奪去而與之拒抗，結果互有負傷。</p>
<p>七月十七日，凡與本案有關者，請陳會長為之謂停，並報吿僑務處林定平盧長辦理，當由林處長向警視應提出損害賠償，國旗佈摩，令日方道歉，並保證今後不再發生同樣事件之抗議，警視廳乃允於三日後答復，京濱僑案因國旗被辱，乃知松田組存心挑置，羣情憤急，故於七月十九日下午四時在華僑聯合會集合，其意乃請求僑務處，設法和平妥善處理，故該日集合並無開會謀對抗之性質。且僑務處　台僑刺激過甚，為鎭定憤激情緒計，林處長應陳會長之請，親到聯合會對台僑曉諭勤解令各人自行返家，且云渠因十六日新橋事故，台僑飽受精神痛苦。當時有一部份僑衆聞語散去，另一小部份仍以為未足，乃集衆同往表團請願，時李立柏少將適將外出，見狀，除與林處長作同樣　諭以安慰台僑外，並深知警察維持治安，自有責任。又以台僑決無尋　之行為，故曾當衆宣稱，歸途安全，不致發生事故，並派吉普國陪送，乃係徇台僑之請，因台僑已知日警與松田組早有勾結，隨時隨地，俱懷戒戄之心，初不料日警竟敢演成槍殺台僑慘案，此某責任，日方當局哄堂大笑不能辭其責。</p>
<p>僑衆由代表團中散去後，即紛乘卡車分途而歸。當各車魚貫由代表團發前後約十數分鐘之間，卡車前有代表團吉普事　　　送，路經　谷警署前，一日警突出車前，並另有日人三四百名齊集於警署門前，僑衆正　　之際，忽又有武裝警察多名經到，內警官十餘名，攔阻去路，並吹警笛，放空槍，勒令停車，路傍排列之日警將吉普車停止行駛，同時並聞「殺」！「殺」！及「發槍」！「發槍」！之聲，於是坐於吉普東之藉僑謝聞畫君，用日語高呼「止」！「止」！並謂，「何以停車行駛？何以持槍相對」？日警非特不理，仍堅囑下車，此間另一警察一手握車，一手作拔擊姿勢，並謂「日本對聯合國尙有治外法權」。正威脅間，　谷警察署長土田馳至經華僑周祥匿君吿以「此係因解散歸家之僑衆。有吉普車護送」等語，署長始允通通過。</p>
<p>逎車輪甫轉，忽聞　　及　　槍聲突起，急如爆竹，於是隨行各車輛所乘坐之多數台僑，於赤手空拳在無可抗拒之下，中彈負傷。及各車陸續駛回代表團時，即有一名受傷，當塲身死，運同受傷十二人均託美國聖路加病院派救護車載往療治，其餘分送同仁會，及廣尾醫院治療。</p>
<p>十九日事故發生至廿六日為止，因重傷致死者計其五名輕重傷者計十八名，至於吉善車及卡車所被擊之彈痕有照卡車為證。又查第四卡車，因遭日警喝令停下，司機范姜利　當塲中彈畢命，車中各人因車無人駕駛，以致所有二十八人均遭警局拘去，現仍拘留在警署中，此乃當晚日警在　谷警署門前槍殺台僑之經過情形。</p>

<h3>僞無錫縣長太湖落草　與共軍取得默契　蘇省保安部嚴令五縣會同圍剿</h3>
<p>〔本報蘇州二日電〕僞無錫縣長楊逆彥斌，勝利後即流竄太湖為寇，曾潛稱總司令，近據確悉，尙有敵無錫憲兵隊長武植隆，亦率殘部五百餘名，與楊逆合夥，號召亡命之徒，總數在三千人左右，已與共軍外團部隊取得默契，竊據湖中平台山·「江南民主聯軍」僞幟，自號司令官，且獲得一部份美式槍戒，聲勢日益浩大，現蘇省保安司令部已嚴令蘇·錫·武·證·吳五縣，自八月上旬會同　剿。</p>
<h3>和平努力迄未成功　共產黨應負全責　吳秘書長在京記者公會說演</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京二日電〕吳秘書長鐵城，為一日在首都記者公會成立大會長官致詞之第一人，吳氏曾以沉痛之語調，對當前時局作情警之分析，渠指出政府對勝利後復員工作之不能順利完成，建國工作遭受障碍，致令人民繼續蒙受災禍與犧牲之不幸，決不閃避責任，並自負起責任，為全國人民解除痛苦，吳氏繼稱：今日局勢，似戰非戰，似和未和，似統一未統一，似團結未團結，人民所受有形與無形之損失，實不可佔計。交通未恢復，生產被窒息，共產黨軍隊還未曾接受政府命令，中共在各地建立之地方政權，亦未嘗奉行政府法令，致軍令，致令至今無法統一，其原因在於本年政府在重慶所作之各種努力完全失敗，政府召開政治協商會議，要求各黨各派參加政府，並召開國民大會，實施軍隊統編整編，恢復交通，停止軍事衝突之所有努力，全部失敗，吾人謀致和平所作努力，終歸失敗之責任，雖雅不願明言，然亦不得不指出，中國共產黨不斷提出問題，不斷製造糾紛，以致破壞政協決　，義壞和平應負之全部責任。</p>
<p>設本年初國共雙方所作之努力及馬歇爾特使協助擬訂之各種方案能付諸實施，則中國之眞正和平，永久和平，眞正統一，永久統一，早已獲致。彼時更不必怕政府將以軍職消滅其黨，更不必怕其黨以武力威脅政府，今舉國渴望和平，國民黨渴望和平，共黨亦願和平，面和平終不可得者，其故在此。</p>
<p>以蘇北　突而論，蘇北均為其產　　　所佔，　　　　　　安全，　覆政府之全　，政府言請其駐防他處，非僅不願接受，且作大搜模攻勢，國軍為自　　，乃不得不予以抵抗，　　界無一國家，無一政府　容許共旁有足以威會其安　之武　都隊也，國內所有紛　　因，由此亦均可得一解釋，吳民最後聲稱：目前局勢雖如此，舉政府仍黨本相忍為國之決心，以一切和平方法，解決一切困難。</p>

<h3>中共的反美行動</h3>
<p>美國駐華海軍陸戰巡邏隊一隊，上月廿九日自天津開往北平，在平津公路上的安平附近，突然遭遇中共部隊的伏兵狙擊，美軍死官兵三名或四名，傷十三名至十五名。此事發生以後，各方莫不認為是一種「不幸事件」，馬歇爾特使本在牯嶺與　蔣主席晤談，聞訊之後，即匆匆飛返南京，以便迅速處理。截至本文執筆時為止，馬熟已接獲詳枞鞭告，鵪已約略遂知中共代表周恩來。同時司徒雷登大使亦在牯嶺舆　蔣主席討論此事，蔣主席除表示關切而外，並命令北平行轅李主任宗仁，進行澈查。此一「不幸事件」的眞相不久當可水落石出。</p>
<p>中共方面對於此案，初則囁嚅其詞，企圖諉卸責任，甚至詭稱該處地帶早無共軍，大概欲以此嫁禍於人。旣而事態漸顯，知道不可復掩，乃由其代表周恩來發言，謂尙未接到報吿，但如有此事，中共願責任，同時卻又稱三星期來，美陸戰隊屢在冀東挑撥共軍，故此事當視美陸戰隊當局之態度而定，中共方面絕無引起衝突之意。甚至急急聲辯「此決非中共對美之政策」。殊不知此種「掩耳盜鈴」之宣傳辭今，眞所謂「欲蓋彌彰」的了。</p>
<p>當此中美邦交益臻親密之際，竟發生此種「不幸事件」，似出於一般人意料之外，尤其是遠在千萬里以外的美國人民，更覺得不可思議。其實揭破內幕，假使早一些把中共的陰謀詭計，赤裸裸的暴露出來，那末，中共的反美攻勢，如何由宣傳而進於行動，更如何由行動而擴大其宣傳，不難一目了然，而此次「不幸事件」發生的作用何在，我們也可「如見期肺肝」。</p>
<p>本報社論早經指出，中共有兩種武器在運用，其一為「反美」宣傳，其二為「反內戰」口號，而自延安發出「七七宣言」公開反美以後，已達圖窮七見的階段。故中共的「反美」，由宣傳而進於行動，乃是奉命而行，與國際相配合的行動，只有淺見短視的人，才會視為突厄。我們預料，美國政府和人民，如過於重視這種行動，誤認為美軍留華將引起麻煩，則中共此類行動，或且層出不窮。聯合社北平二日電稱，美國今日接得警吿，預料華北反美運動將繼續發生，這正是我們所料及的情勢。</p>
<p>中美兩國邦交，素極友好；在這次大戰中，中美兩國的兒女，駢肩作戰多年，兩國已成了運命擊的患難朋友；不但彼此希望共享和平與繁榮，而且還要通力合作，共同促進人類文明的進步。在這次大戰結束之後，美國政府即基於上述崇高的理想，決定了她的對華政策，即希望中國成為和平，民主，統一，強大的國家，在聯合國機構中能盡其維持世界和平的責任。去年十二月間杜魯門總統發表的對華宣言，就是這一五政策的重申。從那時起，一直到今天，美國不論在言語上或行動上，均以此為準繩，從未越過雷池一步。美國駐華軍隊的暫時駐留中國，不僅能協助我國解除日軍武裝，將其遣送返國，完成我國的復員工作，而且對於我國國內和平的恢復，也有重大的裨益。美國這種對華政策的動機，完全是天眞的，是純潔無瑕的。美國的朝野，都相信和平是不可分割的，而中國為遠東的大國，如在擾攘不安之中，則美國亦不能獨享其和平與繁榮。美國協助中國民主統一而強大，能夠維持遠東和平，不僅為中國，實在是為美國，而也就是為世界人類。故凡是中國人，以及具有「人性」的愛好的平者，對於美國的對華政策，決不會存心破壞的。而現在居然有別具肺肝的少數敗類，不惜千方百計以「反美」，其至可能煽動無知愚民，重演「義和團」事件於華北，眞令我們慨　這些人的不長進一至於此！</p>
<p>然則他們為什麼要這樣做呢？回答這句話，只要大家回憶汪精衛陳公傅這班漢奸當年為什麼要大喊「大東亞」，大唱「反英美」，就可思過半矣！當年英美只承認　蔣主席所領導的抗戰的國民政府為唯一的合法政府，故汪陳輩漢奸只好「反英美」。現在美國仍舊只承國民政府為唯一的合法政府，並以一切援助畀予國民政府，那末這些和汪陳輩「默契」之徒自然也就認美國為敵人而鼓動反美了。毛澤東自先發表反美言論，要求美國立即停止對華援助，並撤退在華美軍，其至誣詆美國援華不啻製造內亂，使中國陷於紊亂及貧困。接着中共的應聲蟲，亦即受其導演，羣起叫囂，企圖混亂美國人民的視聽，從而要求其政府停止援華，並撤退在華的駐軍。可是美國除了一小部份人，因見聞不周，誤認為中國國內局勢混沌，前途悲觀，要求政府改策而外，多數有識之士，無不洞悉中國政局的內情，擁護政府的旣定政策，絕不為之動搖。尤其是杜魯門總統與國務卿貝爾納大公報，對於中國前途，抱有信念及決心，以十二萬分的熱忱，切望中國能成為和平，強大與統一的國家。中共方面鑒於其所策動的反美宣傳，不能奏效，乃更進一步，以行動威嚇美國，先之以綁架美兵，繼之以陰襲美國巡邏隊，無非想因此「精彩的演出」，而收到舞臺上「撤退美兵」的「效果」而已。他們為什麼先要美兵此時自華撤退呢？一句話說穿，就是他們想沒有美兵在旁，就可無遮無碍的「全內亂」，大打出手了。所以中共這次襲擊美軍事件，是有計劃的行動，而周恩所說「此決非中共之對美政策」這句話，大有等於「此地無銀三百兩，對門阿二不曾偷」的幽默了。</p>
<p>國民政府於這種大之類似「義和團」，小之類如「臨城刦車」的排外案件，究竟應採何種態度呢？我們以為很簡單：中共與國軍戰，猶可諉為「內戰」，或許可以容認：而今心存排外，事類匪徒，只有斷然剿辦，絕無假借。否則「當斷不斷，反受其亂」，戒之愼之！</p>

<h3>波蘭要求參加匈約討論　遭美代表反對自動撤回</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦二日廣播：規程委員會今日開會討論時，貝爾納斯對波蘭請求出席對匈　和約之委員會時，初次與蘇聯代表莫洛托夫發生公開之爭執。貝氏拒絕波蘭之請求，謂美國遵守四強決議，祗准曾與各軸心附庸國作戰之國家對和約有發言權。波蘭為避免貝氏與莫氏間發生公開之衝突起見，卒將其請求撤回。</p>
<h3>大小國意見不應對立　使和會蒙上暗影　加首相金氏發表演說　捷克代表稱願始終効忠盟邦</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕巴黎廣播：和會第五次大會，於今日下午四時〇二分（上海午夜）開會，捷克代表團團長馬薩里克發表演說，謂捷克國少數民族權利之協定，如戰前所有者·馬氏並未指明何種少數民族，但衆人皆知渠所指者乃捷克境內至匈牙利民族也，此輩匈人，於第一次戰後，依照協定，事有特殊權利，最近捷凶商談時，匈牙利外長即會提出要求，恢復此種少數民族特殊權利之協定。馬氏繼對法國備加稱頌，並稱，捷克始終效忠於盟邦，並以能成為一斯拉夫國家為榮。捷克軍隊曾於烏克蘭作戰，參與鄧扣克之役，並與偉大盟邦美國之軍隊並肩作戰，吾捷克代表團於大會中將有所建議，氏並強調稱，捷克絕不欲尋求任何報復。</p>
<p>馬氏操英語致詞，先向法國表示敬意，繼謂東西各鄰國在此後許多年間，盼能相互保證其安全。我人應認識中歐之情形，及兩次世界大戰之深大原由，我人當明白過去方法之慘敗經驗，試覓新的解決方案，捷克願向和平的，進步的民主主義，暨我盟邦各國效其忠誠云云。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕巴黎二日廣播：在今日和會全體大會中，繼捷外長而發言者，為加拿大總理金氏。金氏要求大會對和約爭執部份勿作決定，並　請四強同時舉行外長會議，以便加速最後和平之獲得。金氏強調各國方面，必須减少分裂，此為參加會議者及全世界人士之衷心願望。金氏續稱，就地理上言，中歐之地位對我人並無密切關係，但不應否認我人參戰極早之事實，因我人立即明瞭世界和平乃一整個而不容分割者。我人之希望實未達到。</p>
<p>此次和會之意養不僅在修正和約草案，對若干問題且應發表各自之意見，以獲得一般的協議，但因大小國間利　衝突而存在不應有之對立，致使和會之真正目標蒙上陰影，此則誠屬憾事也。</p>

<p>〔聯合社倫敦一日電〕艾德禮首相昨晨特自巴黎飛回，參加特別閣議，討論巴勒斯坦問題，英軍參謀長蒙哥馬利亦列席提供意見。英官場對於杜魯門總統不滿英美專家所擬巴勒斯坦分區計劃，驚異之情，顯而易見。樞密院長莫里遜曾宣稱，英國是否接受巴勒斯坦分區計劃，須視美國態度如何為轉移，希望美國能加以結守護。未幾杜魯門總統即電召駐倫敦代表團返國協　。</p>

<h3>英印關係險惡</h3>
<p>〔聯合社紐約一日電〕印度對英關係形勢異常惡劣，若不能獲得一部份解決，又將趨向另一危機。回盟已拒絕參加八月杪或九月初開幕之制憲議會，從事制定印度獨立憲法，並聲言將開始「直接行動」，達到分治目的，另建一回教獨立國。回教領袖已號召於八月十六日休業一日，並停止一切非政治活動，預料回盟領袖將於是日詳細說明其「直接行動」之目的。</p>

<h3>在杜魯門總統家鄉　歡度美國慶節日（上）　聽老華僑談古說今</h3>
<p>— （本報駐美特派員毛樹清）</p>
<p>〔肯薩斯城七月十日航訊〕七月四日美國獨立紀念日，肯薩斯城內，家家戶戶插上國旗，街上寂靜得鴉雀無聲，人們都享受他們的假期去了。上午十點半鐘，老華僑何麗園先生駕着車子，來到了菲列浦旅館。這位七十歲的古希老翁，精神健壯得和三十歲的小伙子一樣。在美國的中國留學生，特別是早輩的留美學生，幾乎沒有不認得他的。他是那樣的勤勞，謙恭和好友，他拍着肩膀告訴我：「我到美國的時候，毛先生，你恐怕還沒出世呢！」他又說：　顯光先生在米蘇里大學念書的時候，是他的老朋友，如今在美國，他依然無時無刻不關懷着　先生的兒子和女婿。他能夠記憶很多在米蘇里州或肯薩斯念書的留學生他從不承認老，他覺得他依然年青。這位老華僑，是關東的「中醫」，早年曾到過上海兩次。來美國已三十多年了。他因為住在肯薩斯城，和當今的白宮主人杜魯門總統，有過廿五年的友誼。一直到現在，他們還時常通訊。他看見杜魯門的青年時代，在田莊耕作，他熟識杜魯門的母親和弟弟，他和杜魯門的兩個侄子，現在當海軍少校和陸軍上尉的兩個年輕人，有很熟的感情。</p>
<p>杜魯門誕生地</p>
<p>格林威村莊，也就是早年何麗園耕作的地方。格林威村離肯薩斯城十三英里，何老自駕的汽車內坐着沈作乾領事和我，我們三個沿大路駛去，肯薩斯城外的無數個村落，像中國的長江流域，一望無際的田疇菓園。格林威村在城外東北部，全村的面積，似乎比整個肯薩斯城還大。村內有很多大草坪，那是高爾夫球場，很多美國青年，在玩高爾富球消受他們的國慶。一座一座的大莊園，相隔七八百米，遙遙相接。許多莊園的主人是猶太人，猶太人積了錢，購買美國的地皮。當年用很低的價格收進，現在都漲了幾倍。村子中間，有一座一百四十英畝的莊園，掛着「出讓」的條子，裏面有魚池·草坪·耕地·山坡，有數不盡的大樹森林。聽說「賣主祗要二萬六千塊錢」。他說這是非常合算的一筆買賣。這座出賣的莊園，離開格林威鎮不遠，市鎮的端角，有杜太夫人住宅</p>
<p>一座很小的白色木屋，二層樓，屋外一塊小小的草坪，草坪外有新修的鐵絲藩籬，猜想起來，大概這是杜魯門「得發」了以後，唯一報效老母的裝飾。杜魯門的母親，經常住在這裏，那天我們原想去順道一見「杜太夫人」的，偏偏不巧，她外出，鐵絲藩籬的矮門，上着闊鎖。杜魯門父親早死，幼年時代，就隨着母親，過着這兒的田莊生活。他母親有四百英畝耕地，因為沒有錢還田糧，好幾次幾乎被拍賣沒收。鄉裏人稱杜魯門為「放牛童」，杜魯門年青時，經濟境况是相當悲慘的。杜魯門的母親，是一個勤儉為本的婦人，她養雞，喂豬，靠微薄的收入，維持全家的經濟生活。杜魯門總統和林肯總統的出身貧窮是一致的，但青年時代的經濟背景，却有差別。林肯是一個以自力為主的流亡青年，而杜魯門却是十足的田園風味人物。</p>
<p>農業社會的特性是穩重和保守，這和林肯那種「雄才大略」的陶冶，顯然不同。杜魯門後來進城當商店職員，研究法律，乃至於當州郡的法官，一貫都是以守成穩健著稱的。何麗園老華僑，現在還保存有一九三〇年的中醫准許開業執照，是杜魯門當州郡法官時頒發的。不過，「杜魯門」一字的，簽名式，已經和現在的不同了。從州郡法官到聯邦參議員，這裏面，得力於一個人的「提拔」，這個人便是前任肯薩斯市的市長潘迪貢斯。潘迪貢斯當年的聲望，和當今的支加哥市長開萊一樣，被稱為民主黨中的「鐵腕」後台，肯薩斯市的市民，也和支加哥一樣稱牠為「潘迪貢斯機器」，在美國，某人被某班底；被稱為「機器」，這意義是好壞互見的，「機器」表示他有社會力量，有聲望，操縱地方事務，同時，又是全國性的政黨後台。但在另一方面，機器，也暗示著他包攬「嫖賭吃喝」，從中漁利。但潘迪貢斯終於倒了霉，原因是民主黨內部人士的檢舉。告發潘迪貢斯的，是現任肯薩斯市參議會的議長戴萊，也是一個民主黨有力人物，同時也是老華僑何麗園的老朋友。他控告潘氏的罪名是匿報「所得稅」，這在美國，特別在戰時的美國，是視同非凡。當時的「官司」，打到華盛頓大理院，最後判定有罪，因為身體健康失調，法院給予「緩刑」，緩刑期間，這位杜魯門的「恩人」，去年便鬱鬱而死在肯薩斯城。杜魯門並不因當了總統而富，何麗園老華僑可以從杜魯門的家境上斷定，因為何老知道他們的家，知道杜魯門在任職參議員任內，每年都有「虧空」，還要向何老家請求補助。在一九三〇年以後，杜魯門的老弟，仍然「躬耕」於格林威村的莊園，却因農產品漲價而逐漸致富，如今，杜魯門的弟弟，已是格林威村七百英畝田莊的主人了。因為放假，我們沒有會著這位「務農為本」的元首弟弟却仔細看到了他的耕作。那兒有冬瓜，洋芋，番茄，青菜，也有稻麥。杜魯門的兩個侄子，也有一座白色的新屋，築在莊園側面。都當軍官出征去了，何老說：「他們在英國」。</p>
<p>奉命　　撙節開支</p>
<p>〔　華盛頓一日電　〕杜魯門　軍參謀長艾森　威　　　尼米資之抗議　　海軍均實節省開支·海軍局亦　到同樣命令，新式郵船七艘因之勢將停造。美國除由運兵船改造者外，大型郵船現無一艘。杜魯門並通令各機關主管人員稱，為避免通貨膨脹情形及减少公債起見，各機關均須縮减開支至最低限度。</p>
<h3>美要求遠東委會　重訂日賠償辦法</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓一日電〕本日據悉：美要求遠東委會將前草擬之日本賠欵案，全部予以廢棄，並根據美新提案重行起草。該提案曾于前週提出，現由委會檢討中，據悉該案建議于遠東委員下，另建一種機構，由該機構向遠東委會提出報告，惟各職員應以全部時間，從事賠償案起草工作。該機構將運續舉行會議，俾使根據巴黎和會之德賠欵案，獲致一適當之决定。巴黎和會已决定與德交戰各國之分配額，規定德內外資產之劃分，並决定該項資產，各盟國應如何取得之。美因對國務院及鮑萊賠償團在遠東委會所作之工作，有所不滿，故乃提出該案，予以改善云。</p>
<h3>通貨惡性膨脹　日鈔發行額　突破五百億圓</h3>
<p>〔改造社東京二日電〕日本銀行券發行額已突破五百億日圓關。按迄七月底止發行額總數為四百九十七億三千萬圓。昨日因提取生活資金等，復增發約三億圓。七月份日本銀行券膨脹額，計共六十九億七千二百萬圓，每日平均增加二萬五千八百萬圓。</p>
<h3>遠東國際法庭　各證人保持一貫作風·東北事變歸咎關東軍·力圖為日本政府卸責</h3>
<p>〔改造社東京二日電〕陸東國際法庭今日續傳前駐葡公使森島守人到庭作證。按遠東法庭所傳各證人，自前任兵務局長田中隆吉以迄森島，所作證言均步驟一致，保持一貫作風，即將東北事變之發動，歸咎於關東軍若干將校，及其他若干個人之思想行動，力圖為日政府卸責，更避免牽涉日皇在內。</p>
<p>〔聯合社東京二日電〕遠東國際法庭今日續審日戰犯，檢察官方面證人即一九三一年任駐瀋陽總領事之森島守人供稱，張作霖於皇姑屯被炸一案，關東軍應負責任，田中首相曾計劃審訊此案幕後之煽動人，但遭日本軍人反對，田中內閣且因此提出辭職。田中對滿洲所採政策，似以維持滿洲治安保護滿洲及中國本部之日人及其合法利益，不干涉中國內政，及支持門戶開放主義為根據。惟田中內閣對滿洲所採政策，較其前任內閣為積極。</p>
<h3>森島荒謬言論　庭長予以駁斥</h3>
<p>〔中央社東京二日專電〕日本前駐瀋陽總領事森島，今晨在國際法庭嚴厲審　之下，轉為偏向被告之作證，謂鑒於當時蔣委員長手下之軍隊，已有趨向革命之危機，故迫使關東軍不得不取保障中國東北日人生命財產之行動。又稱，張作霖被害後，猛烈之反日運動即在東北形成。森島認為此乃由於張學良之心向國民黨，均及孫總理之三民主義（滲入）東北之故。森島以關東軍在東北使用武力之事實，歸咎於當地反日情緒之高漲時，庭長魏勃即阻斷其語，斥之曰：「一味猜測，決無作證價值。」</p>
<h3>伊朗總理沙丹納　組成新內閣</h3>
<p>一身仍兼三職　兩派勢力平均</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社德黑蘭一日電〕伊朗新內閣頃告成立，左派杜德黨亦參加政府，此為第一次。據公報載稱，沙丹納仍任總理兼內政外交兩部長。杜德黨員獲得三部，即葛却伐茲任教育部長，艾斯簡達利任工商部長，猚慈第任衛生部長。此外政府發言人費洛　親王·社會宣傳部長譚平·陸長阿瑪第均未調動。前任財長赫基爾再度參加，據此間觀察家談稱，伊朗新內閣為「親俄派」與「親英派」兩種勢力所平均分配。</p>
<h3>蘇聯鎗决奸逆</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社莫斯科二日電〕蘇聯奸逆伐拉索夫將軍及其僚屬十一人　，曾在戰時組織蘇聯輔助隊，幫助德軍作戰，罪大惡極，經法庭判決死刑，已於本日槍決。</p>
<h3>紐倫堡法庭素描　胖子戈林　是最有氣概的一個　柵欄門外擠滿了看客</h3>
<p>〔聯合社紐倫堡一日電〕在紐倫堡法庭受案的廿二名納粹戰犯。已成為德國吸引遊客的最大目標。每次休息時間，看客們擠滿柵欄外，想一瞻各犯真面目，有些人喊道：「看赫斯！看施特萊轍！他正在吃麵包呀！」有些看客用雙眼放大鏡向他們凝視，使犯人們特別惱　。瘦削而赤　的前德軍參謀總長卓特爾怒不可遏，有時把兩手圈在眼睛四周，好像拿着一對望遠鏡，向討厭的看客反看，操德語喃喃叱斥。這種把戲常常引起閧笑，致使卓特爾怒上加怒。他們這一批犯彌天大罪的納粹要人們，因長期的監禁，已大多數失去傲慢。當德國律師提出他們最後辯護狀時，都呆若木雞，或者怏怏然四顧法庭。八個月的長篇大論已使整個法庭疲倦，審訊至最高潮倒反而覺得遲鈍了。只有在休息的時間，各被告才從半昏迷狀態復蘇，交換字條，略作說笑。戈林看上起仍為最有氣概威風的一個。他最得法庭的尊敬，因為他不掩飾，且繼續效忠已死的希特勒，美國人喜歡忠心的人。他患着坐骨神經痛，據法庭職員說：「他企圖造成希特勒為傳奇人物失敗後，已失去了興趣。當德國律師誹謗希特勒時，戈林埋臉入手，微微搖頭。</p>
<h3>匈發行新貨幣</h3>
<p>〔路透社布達佩斯一日電〕匈牙利政府今日發行新貨幣，定名為弗勞林特，每一弗勞林特值舊幣四千萬萬班戈，匈政府已按新幣計算生活指數，並訂立日用品之限價。</p>
<h3>國際點滴</h3>
<p>日吉田內閣內部因新舊思想之衝突，不無裂痕，內閣有局部改組之象，尤其是　相和田之辭職，短期內即將實現。</p>
<p>挪威代表團二日抵莫斯科，與蘇聯當局討論最後邊境問題。</p>

<p>程中行致詞</p>
<p>嗣由程委員中行致詞，渠首先說明召集談話會的動機，是要聽各公會代表說話，繼補充張團長意見稱：「接收工作，由去年鬧到現在，鬧到國內與國外，實在是一種恥辱，洗刷這種恥辱的責任政府首先要努力，人民也要努力，我國社會風氣，向來有一種病態，就是大家對於任何一件事，都喜歡背後批評，不願當面檢舉，這是不負責任的表現，中國政治多少年沒有進步、也許就種因在這種病態上，今天我們要求商界領袖，對接收工作之錯誤，能直言無　，充分表示負責任的精神，本團謹以最誠懇最處心的態度，接受諸位的意見，希望能與諸位合作，上海見一個關係極複雜的都市接收工作所發生的問題，一定很多，本團派到這個地方來做淸查工作，以我們的經費人力來估計，均感不够，如何能不辱使命，使清查工作發生一點效果，實在要靠諸位的協助，換句話說，我們的力量，就是諸位的力量，我們的成就，也就是諸位的成就，希望諸位今天都能表現出公民應盡的責任，提示我們很多的綫索、共同努力，完成使命，程氏詞畢，各公會代表衣紛紛發表意見。</p>

<h3>磯谷谷壽戴夫兩罪魁　今日移解軍事法庭　谷壽夫對南京大屠殺力圖推諉　磯谷率直承認侵華罪行</h3>
<p>發動侵華戰事之磯谷康介及谷壽夫兩主要戰犯，自經國防部電令我駐日代表團咨照美方，業於前日傍晚專機押解抵滬，當由國防部戰犯管理處收押於該處將校收容所內。茲悉，該兩犯已定今晨移解上海軍事法庭依法偵訊審辦，中央社記者特於昨日赴江灣高境廟該處收容所，由姚副處長開白引導參觀，並與磯谷等談話。該兩犯係另囚一室，與其他收容之日藉將校戰罪嫌疑犯隔離，似較他犯優待，門外則派有士兵二名，荷槍監視。記者入室時，兩犯正各沿床而坐，狀頗憂　，因前日在機塲曾一度晤而交談，故見記者至，均起立示迎，而谷壽夫「哈　」之聲，已脫口而出，立即退去其鼻樑上之黑邊限鏡，舉手讓坐，狀至謙恭查該兩犯中磯谷較爲率值坦白，對其過去之罪行，亦勇於承認，而谷壽夫則吾，談話時多方設法掩飾其罪行。據磯谷廉介稱：太平洋事變後，渠雖位尊至香港總督，煊赫一時，今春乃以戰罪嫌疑被捕，刻轉解來華，渠深信與香港總督之職務無關，故其罪行，應屬於在津浦綫一帶作戰時事，如其所屬在津浦綫作戰時有違反人道之行爲，渠爲部隊長，當應負完全責任，願判以應得之罪，蓋中日八年戰事中，中國損失太大，日本實應負責，渠雖係以戰罪押解來華，而極願向中國友人謝罪云。至此，磯谷又轉而作丑表功，謂其任香港總督之初，即釋放遭日軍逮捕華人，令其各自離去，內中多數，係至重慶及上海者云。磯谷又謂：當張鼓峯事件後，日蘇衝突之「諾門罕事件」，渠亦參加，時任關東軍參謀長，並詳述戰敗免職，三聯隊長切腹自殺之事蹟，不勝感慨系之。至谷壽夫，對於南京大屠殺案，企圖卸責，反覆跪稱不知，因其在京僅駐三天，同時進兵攻佔南京者，尚有其他師團，渠不能負此責任云云。記者曾詢以今春被捕後，在巢鴨獄中之情況，據該兩犯稱：日本在戰後，食糧缺乏，而獄中食糧，則由日政府供給，故每日均　薄粥，從未得食乾飯，監獄鐵窗石壁，異常堅固，蓋此係日人自造者，言至此，彼等亦不覺失笑。美軍管理監獄甚嚴，所有拘押人犯，一律不得交談，東條等人，僅在每天體操時見一面，各犯人家屬，每月僅能接見一次云云。</p>

<p>防止工潮　共同努力</p>
<p>最後谷部長歸納各方意見作實施社會保險，允其對於一般經濟生活不安的勞工，要施行上海保臉和失業保險。本部已經車准在本年內成立中央社會保險局籌備處，積極進行籌備的工作，社會保險是勞資協調最有效的一種方法，對勞方而　是保陣勞工生活、增進勞工服利的，對資方而言，是發揮勞動效能增加生意的，並且也是政府和勞資三方合作最具體的一種東西，這個問題，與各位都有密切的關係，今天就此機會特別提出來，我們願意與工業界勞工界的各位先生共同努力。</p>

<h3>青年中學近訉</h3>
<p>本市林森中路靑年中學，因歷史悠久，環境優良，校務夙稱發達。今春，潘公展氏出任該校董事長，即請季灝祖任校長。季氏革新校務，增進設施，一時市中心區靑年執經問難者，咸以一入其門爲譽。頃間，該校正利用暑期，一面辦理補習，兼施義敎，一面繕修校舍，擴充設置，幷準備新敎訓計劃之實施。刻已遴聘廣東省文理學院敎授皮禹爲秘醫，任敎該校十餘年之數理敎員濮梓祥爲敎務主任，他如訓育主任翟樹榮，體育主任儲休芳，圖書館主任任苯生，及各科敎員等，又均爲敎育界知名之士。並聞該校因鑒於一社會風氣，日漸下墮，决定今後敎訓實拖，以培義民族道德爲主要目標云。</p>
<h3>中教職業保障問題　董洗凡發表聲明</h3>
<p>日前滬市若干報紙，載有同濟大學校長董洗凡，對「上海中等學校敎負職業保障會」某君之談話一則，頃據董氏談稱：該項新聞之內容實與原意，頗有出入。當時該會某君來校訪問時，曾謂：敎育局應通令各中學當局，不可無故解聘敎員。余即表示因係初來上海，地方情形，甚不熱悉，對於他校事件，尤無置喙餘地。至於任何學校聘任敎員，皆應以敎學能力作權衡之標準，此乃自然之理，實無通令之必要。若於晤談之問，主張聘任之事項，以敎學能力作標準，則凡從事敎育者，自皆贊同等語。是故日前報載之談話，未免有斷章取義之處，理應有所聲明云。</p>

<h3>美國第一所盲童學校　一八二九年創立的配肯斯</h3>
<p>配肯斯盲童學校，位於美國麻省波斯頓城的郊外。那裏，從世界各地來的盲童在散步，讀書，歡笑，遊戲，如常人一樣快樂。他們不用狗引路，不用手杖，但能從教室問跑來跑去，樓梯上走上走下，在廣達五十四的校園中散步。到週末，他們自己整好手提箱，回家去過假日。</p>
<p>這個學校，創立於一八二九年，是美國第一所盲童學校。他門的目標，是要使殘疾的人也能有機會把自己的力能貢獻給社會。畢業生中，已有許多是社會上的知名之士，作家，和音樂家。</p>
<p>配肯斯是一片愉快的樂土。一百十七年來，它的敎育都是很嚴格的。學校十分明暸每個學生的個性才能，敎師們依着他們的個性才能來敎導。特別靈敏的觸覺和聽覺，並不是盲童天生就有的這也需要長期的耐心訓練。</p>
<p>在學期開始時，你可能會碰到一個學生在兩所屋子問走着，突然地停了下來，拍了一下掌，然後又向前走了。靠了拍掌傳來的但聲，他可以知道自己已走了離屋子多遠了，但幾天以後，連這一點也不可需要了。</p>
<p>一百年前，配肯斯就拋業了「盲人看不見，一切可馬虎」的錯誤觀念，而和別的正常學校一樣地造起了巍峨的校舍，高塔，花國。裏面有花草，樹木，池沼，小徑，其美麗簡直似一所地上的天堂。漂亮的敎室中閒，都有走廊，孩子們不必怕雨雲。</p>
<h3>草地網球賽　定九日開始　男子單雙打秩序抽定　女子參加寥寥無幾</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市首屆草地網球競賽，男子單打已定於本月九日起開始比賽，高級幼級單打同時開始，雙打則定於八月二十六日起賽，女子賽及混合雙打因報名者寥寥，報名展期至六日截止。</p>

<p>實力觀測</p>
<p>男子高級單打，參加者共十人，以陶冠球柯拉沙卡遜王文正實力最强，複賽不出此四人，柯拉沙於第二週將遇周冠軍謝兆良之勝者，周冠軍是吾能勝柯拉沙，殊無把握。李國璠第一週即遇卡遜，不勝可惜。</p>
<p>男子雙打參加者共計十對，以卡遜史規亞，余田光朋納維區。王文正陶冠球，李國璠蔡國基四組最强，屆時當由此四組複賽、惟余田光朋納維區第二週中將逢謝兆良許承位，李國璠蔡國基第一週逢周冠軍李磊石，恐有劇列競爭。男子幼級單打參加者二十八人，形勢尚難預測。抽定秩序錄下：</p>

<p>民政簡報</p>
<h3>本市禮俗行政　劃歸社會局主辦</h3>
<p>本市禮俗行政原由社會局主辦，嗣因該項業務屬於民政範圍，移交民政處辦理。市府近以民政處限於人事編制，又將增添兵役優待等業務，所有禮俗行政接辦，自有困難。昨分令各該局處，仍歸社會局繼續辦理云。</p>
<p>第二區區民代表　請劃地建築區址</p>
<p>本市第二區區民代表會，第一次會議議決建造該會會址，及該區區公所所址，經推定代表劉協勛·汪仰眞·賀惠德等六人，組織請求團，而向市長請求劃撥空餘公地土案，於昨日（一日）上午十時，由該區區長李汝椿陪往市府謁見市長。經該代表等陳述理由及辦法後，吳市長頗爲贊同，允即轉飭有關局處調查後劃撥。而於該代表等對地方自治工作之熱忱，更爲欣慰。並以希望該區成爲本市模範區相勉。最後復指示今後區保工作方針，各代表以已得圓滿結果，即欣辭而去。</p>
<p>廿三區興修碼頭</p>
<p>第二十三區轄境之吳淞鎭，爲上海海道必經之鉅埠，商業繁盛，帆　林立。自八一三戰事起後，沿江各碼頭悉遭暴敵毀壞，致起卸貨物，極感不便。該區區公所有鑒及此，特發動當地紳商各界，向各工廠商店及股戶捐募鉅款，將較爲重要之外馬路長勝樓碼頭，先行修築，現正估計工料，不日將開始動工。</p>
<p>又訊，第二十三區（吳淞），救濟麵粉已於五月三十一日分發赤貧戶，計三百七十八包，尚有剩餘六十八包，經委托該區區公所辦理，迄至七月廿八日止，已代爲發放完竣。</p>
<h3>戶籍法規　疑義問答（續）</h3>
<p>（十四）問：有未進過私塾，又未受過學校敎育而能識字者，應如何塡記，其敎育程度？</p>
<p>答：可視其識字之程度列爲「私一」或「私二」等。</p>
<p>（十五）問：理髪匠有開舖營業，與挑担營業者，應歸入何業？</p>
<p>答：經營理髮爲生者，無論開舖與流動者，均可列爲其他職業</p>
<p>（十六）問：銀行職員，是否爲商業抑係公務？</p>
<p>答：國家銀行職員可列爲一公務」，其他地方或私人銀行職員，可列爲「商業」。</p>
<p>（十七）問：僧道募化誦經，是否列爲宗敎事業，抑係無業？</p>
<p>答：僧道若以募化爲生，則所得收入，係屬贈與，而非報酬，與沿門托鉢之乞丐同爲「無業」。若以誦經取得報酬，自屬宗敎事業，應列爲「自由職業」。若誦經取得報酬，仍兼募化，則應以其有報酬之部份爲主，列為自由職業。</p>
<h3>各區簡訉</h3>
<p>第二十二區公所昨（一）下午三時，召集所屬十二保幹事舉行會議。區長出席主持，聽取各保幹事上月份經辦工作報告，並對今後工作方針，有所指示。</p>

<p>本市第六區（盧家灣）區長章鵬若因病辭職，市府派民政處督導鄭俠接充，鄭區長已於昨日到區視事。鄭區長服務黨政各界歷二十餘年，老成練達，此次出任區長，定多建樹云。</p>
<p>十一區（新成）區公所，特聘同德，中美，惠旅，宏仁，平民療養院，新閘衛生實騐所，同濟大學附屬醫院等七醫院，實施貧民免費診治。又注射防疫工作，自即日起，每日下午四時至六時，改由區民逕往同孚路同德醫院注射。</p>

<h3>民政處答長虹君</h3>
<p>說話半月刋第一期長虹君「向民政處建議」一文，據民政處主管人員談：長虹君愛護本市保甲制度，向本處建議各點，深爲欽佩。惟所舉問題多與事實不符，茲分別說明，以釋誤會。</p>
<p>（一）身分證原爲便利持證人隨時證明本人身份之用，故證內須詳載各項事實，如過分簡略，仍須赴市府驚局，區公所查閱戶口調查表，則身分證完全失却效用。</p>
<p>（二）新印遜入聲請書「年齡」欄，並非遺漏，而係依照中央訂頒表式擬訂。至中央表式何以不列年齡，因年齡須年年增加，本年所塡，明年即須推算，故改用出生年月，因出身年月係永久不變，可减少年齡錯誤。</p>
<p>（三）戶內有三人，係由三個地方而來者，吾人不能疏忽，此三人決非同時到達。如先後到達，即應先後分別塡書聲請，根本不成問題。如湊巧此二人同時到達，則可合塡一張聲請書，何處來與原住址一欄，不敷塡寫時，可於備考攔內註明。</p>
<p>（四）房客已去而不申報遷出，保甲長自應督促申報。門上加鎖，尚有返回之意思，於返回時督促申報即可。又全家一走了之，近於逃避，保甲長一時如何得知？責備保甲長，實屬無辜。但保甲長對逃亡之戶口，亦有查報之責耳。</p>
<p>其餘長虹君指出表式過於繁複，其實均參照中央所訂頒者，且此項表式，戰時施行於各省縣鄉，已具成效，上海文化水準，當不致較各省縣鄕爲低，似毋庸過慮也。圖示：風光旖旎的配肯斯盲童學校</p>

<h3>金價升　美鈔小挫</h3>
<p>烚赤昨有實銷，尚形穩定，起仆有限，交易尚不見暢，晨初一八八萬，開後需要者托錢兌業來進，繼續徽挺至一八八萬八，而後見定，央行以一八八萬五之價配給六三條，十時後漸趨平定，低價曾退至一八七萬八，午刻則站定於一八八萬以上，午後繼續穩健，仍在原價掙扎，結果較前收微升二千，銀樓飾　微升爲念萬〇二，紋銀平而銀元升，唶拆銀根平衡，息價自一角至一角三不等。</p>
<p>外帶美鈔亦是穩定，隨金市稍作推進，展開二五一〇元，高價二五二〇元，低價二四九〇元，午刻又在二五一〇元左右盤旋，並無任何特殊活動，午後仍在二五〇〇元左右徘徊，結果較前收回挫十五元，港票在五六〇元內外徘徊，結果則微降三元，港匯五四五元至五五五元，印匯六六〇元至六七〇元，英匯八千八至八千九，賣價尚肯酌减，美　仍告呆滯。</p>
<h3>公債雜牌見秀</h3>

<h3>華股盤旋不定</h3>
<p>華股在高檔盛旋，永紗有某炙手可熱之大戶，大量出罷，欲漲而止者再，美亞則低後屢有反動，各小股倍形冷淡，察共形勢，永紗仰高而止，難免　度盤旋，晨初最高價時永紗七三〇元，美亞則最低三七三〇元，三小股則由高而下，景福自二五元退至二三三元，新光自二四五元退至二二七元，勤興自一八五元退至一六七元，中途永紗見低價六九五元，美亞則反見高價四一五〇元，仍在背道而行，近午都由低微回，結果較前收永紗回跌二十元、美亞則平，景　新光各跌半成，勤與則微降而已，較冷各中小型除新亞世界告平，餘者均見微挫，元老股平平。</p>
<p>外股欲漲又止，怡紗晨開九五〇〇元後，不進則退，引起多方不安，開後陸續小挫，退至九〇〇〇元而後定，怡啤更爲遜色，業廣紙業兩者尚告平定，結果較前收計怡紗會德　跌落半成，怡啤跌一成光景，亞洲鋼業英聯微跌，羹廣紙業尚平。</p>

<h3>爪哇茶產劇減</h3>
<p>〔路透社爪哇二日電〕爪哇茶產量一九四〇年曾達六二·〇〇〇噸，但去年已說減至一·七〇〇噸，其原因一係由於糧食缺乏，茶園皆改種糧食，二係由於日本佔領時之不予注意，而只顧及戰爭原料之種植，荷屬東印度政府刻正努力設決恢復生產，一年後期能達戰前生產量百分之廿。</p>

<h3>農貸　對象共有七種　期限多在一年以內　月息最低祗有二分</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕記者頃訪中國農民銀行本市分行，訽以該行辦理農貸情形。承告滬行：辦理農貸，按農業之性質而分，共有七種：即生產·運銷·倉庫·推廣·副業·水利·急貸等是。貸款對象，以農會及合作社爲主。此外如公營有關農業之推廣及改進等機構，私人創辦之農塲等，亦酌量貸給款項。貸款年限，以普通生產貸款而言，大多在一年以內。此外如水利等貸款，時期比較冗長，惟最長以不超過三年爲原則。目前農貸，以生產性之放款居多。滬行放款範圍，包括二十一縣。惟現以交通阻滯關係，實際辦理農貸者，僅江南十六縣。此中尤以蘇州·無錫·常熟·吳江一帶之蠶絲貸款；太倉·嘉定·崑山一帶之棉花貸款；佔數尤鉅。普通農貸，最高月息以不超過四分爲原則。至如含有救濟性質之緊急貸款，則月息僅二分。滬行自本年三月初開始辦理農貸以來迄已貸出款項總數達二十億元。此中屬於生產方面之農貸，則佔一半以上云。</p>

<p>（本報訊）中國植物油料廠囊理李廷棟氏頃語本報記者稱：本市食油供應情形，可不致發生問題。對汕價前途，亦表樂觀。緣按該廠目前之生產量而言，足供本街實銷一半而有餘。如公用局能着電力公司對該廠恢復正常供電址，則該廠對全市食油之需要量，足可全力員担供應。現估計全市每日約需消耗食油一千餘担，而該廠目前直接配售於各零售店者，日達七百市祖。該廠之配售食油，初係受敵僞產業處理局之委託，登報接受全市零售店由請直接配售。經該廠調查結果，合格者有六百家。當分甲乙丙三組，每組兩百家，遂日輪流配售，昨日配售丙組零售店二百家，每家配　荳油一桶。計重三十担半。每担配售價爲七萬三千元，包括運費在內。各店門售價規定最多利潤，不得超過百分之十，故約計每斤約在八百十元左右。該廠現决每日繼續直接配售，决不中斷，以達抑平油價之目的，又該廠日前自青島運到生油一千担，中國食油公司亦運到七千担，故本市食油問題，决無　匱乏云。</p>

<h3>偵查中的李聞案</h3>
<p>— 本報廿九日昆明航訊　特派員張生力</p>
<p>李聞被刺兩案，相繼發生於五日內，迄今時逾半月，案情尚未大白，各地傳說紛紜，昆市謠諑尤多，不管「謠諑」來自何方，「宣傳」作用何在，而在全案未告公佈之際，一般人無從遽下「想當然耳」的結論。記者根據個人在昆的片段見聞，及各方面對此案的反應，綜合報道其概略如下：</p>
<h3>李公樸　被刺經過</h3>
<p>李公樸被刺案，發生於七月十一日晚。這個突發的血案，在十二日的昆市各報上，均無詳細紀載，一般人認為左傾的「人民壁報」，也只在翌晨發出了一張簡略的緊急號外，報告李先生的死訊。民主周刊（民盟機關報）等十四個期刊，十五日出版了聯合增刊第二期，刊載「李公樸先生被刺經過，」（無作者姓名）略稱：「十一日晚七時許，李公樸先生因事，與其夫人張曼筠女士先後外出，八時餘事畢，同往昆明大戲院觀電影，十時電影畢，在南屏街搭公共汽車，回返北門街寓所，於青雲街車站下車，甫行至青雲街通至大興街的小巷中，就突聞槍聲自後面傳來，李夫人尚以為是車胎破裂聲，不料即見李氏中彈倒地，呻吟於泥濘中，李夫人情急大呼：「捉人吶，槍打人了！」雨中行人疏落，未見人來。」</p>
<h3>槍聲一響</h3>
<p>聯合增刊上另一文，題為「從近日樓到青雲街，」似以目擊者的身份，描述當時的情況。略稱「李公樸先生與夫人坐在汽車中部的旁坐上，李先生着雨衣，李夫人着旗袍，罩茄克，頭裏白圍巾，他們的兩旁，各坐一着黃色軍便服的青年，有一個的頭髮，斜遮右眼。他們的斜對面，坐一摩登女人，旁亦坐一着黃色軍便服的青年，此外車上尚有着黃衣者數人，餘均為普通人。車至青雲街車站停下，首先有幾個普通人下去，繼之李公樸夫婦下，緊跟着他們下去的，是那坐在他們斜對面摩登女人旁的黃制服青年，繼之三個普通人，繼之則是那兩個坐在他們旁邊的黃制服青年。」「本人並不在此下車，當然坐於車內，忽聞「槍聲」一響，人即嘈亂，本人遂與每人爭於下車一睹究竟，只見後下的那兩個黃衣青年高呼：「拿着了。拿着了！」是雲南口音，人拿電筒一照，見被打着的即是李先生…這時人聲嘈雜，那位摩登女人則高呼：「兇首就是坐在我旁邊的那一個。」本人猛然想起時，兇首已向青雲街西端逃走，那兩個喊「拿着了」的，亦已不見。李夫人也追了去，本人乃用力跟大家一齊追去，至警察三分局門口，見那黃衣的兇首，已被警察擋獲於街旁，兩手舉起，連說：「不是我，不是我，」亦為雲南口音，中等身材。後被帶進局內去。不久，來一個小脚太婆對警士說：「他買我的東西，差五十塊錢，嚇跑了。」意思是想使警察輕輕放了。」</p>
<p>根據聯合增刊的紀載，兇犯似有三人，均捉黃衣，而且是雲南口音。槍聲有似「車胎破裂聲」。其非滅音手槍可知矣。</p>
<h3>昆市治安機關　對李案的表示</h3>
<p>十三日昆市報紙，刊載治安機關對李案的表示，略謂「曾市長當晚（十一日晚）十時許據報後，星夜駐守市府，督飭警局及各分局暨各區公所，上緊緝兇，並飭龔局長（警察局長）率領幹員，到達出事地點偵查，暨通知法院檢騐。聞市府對李公樸先生被刺殞命一案，極為重視，除將當場捉獲嫌疑犯一人，解請警備總部審訊，並立即分報省府及警備總部鑒核外，現已加派幹員四出偵緝。」（雲南社訊）</p>
<p>又據警察局龔局長談稱：「前晚（十一）十時許，李公樸先生在青雲街大興街坡脚被暴徒狙擊中槍，當由警察第三分局聞聲趕至，將嫌疑犯李成業一名帶局，輕訊供稱：我是四川人，在航空委員會第十修理工廠充機械軍士，由馬市口乘公共汽車往大梅園巷訪一陳姓友人，甫下車，驟聞槍聲，為避免危險，驚忙走馳，致被警局拿獲等語。三分局員當由該犯身上，搜出法幣三萬元，小刀一把，並無其他凶器，當即解送警備總部訊辦。…現霍總司令對本案極為重視，除將嫌疑犯李成業交軍法處嚴訊外，並嚴飭所屬限期緝兇歸案究辦，以維治安」。（載於十三日各報）</p>
<p>李成業的初次口供，與聯合增刊紀載的經過，實已大有出入之處。孰是孰非，記者無從判斷。</p>
<h3>民盟滇支部　對李案抗議</h3>
<p>民主同盟雲南支部，十二日向政府提出抗議：（一）澈查造成本案之直接負責人及兇手，並予以嚴厲懲處。（二）對死者家屬優予撫卹。（三）立即實踐四項諾言，取消特務組織，維護人權，並保障以後，不得不發生同類事件。（載於七月十五日聯合增刊）</p>
<h3>街頭　標語　傳單</h3>
<p>李案發生後，聯大雲大附近，標語傳單壁報甚多。最注目者有兩種：一種由昆明學生聯合會或某某壁報署名，宣稱「李公樸先生是國特殺死的。」一種由「銀南反共大同盟」署名，文曰：「共產黨殺死李公樸。」「艾思奇殺死李公樸。」另外，還出現一個「中國共產黨雲南支部通告」：「查李公樸近來言行荒謬，諸多違反本黨黨綱，本支部奉延安毛主席密令，將李公樸槍決。李公樸旣不遵守黨紀，違抗命令，死有餘辜。（餘略）」</p>
<h3>滇省警備總部　申明立場</h3>
<p>滇省警備總司令部發言人，十三日發表談話稱：「（前略）本部職司治安之責，自應盡力緝兇歸案法辦，以慰幽靈，乃日內有少數人對本部妄肆詆毀，意圖嫁禍，惟恐天下不亂，言之殊堪痛惜。本部責任在治安，對治安以外之任何問題，素不干預，故對本案除加緊嚴令所屬緝兇務期破案外，尚祈社會人士多予協助」。（中央社訊）</p>
<h3>兩件公函</h3>
<p>同日，（十三）警備總部致函民盟滇支部，函云：「（前略）本日（十三）據報，街衢張貼之標語壁報，有由學聯會署名，有由學生自治會署名，其中關於李公樸先生被害之紀載，竟有誣衊本部者，事關誹謗公署明譽，法有懲處明文，該類壁報標語，是否與貴同盟有關，或為貴同盟所主使，應請注意，並希望明見復。」（中央社訊）</p>
<p>民盟滇支部接函後，翌日復警備總部函云：「（前略）敝同盟自有政治立場與尊重法治之主張，貴部所見標語壁報，旣有署名團體，是否為該團體所張貼，雖不可知，但其與本同盟無關，至極明顯。貴部所稱，似係敝同盟主使，　請負責更正，以正視聽。惟敝同盟有不能已於言者：李公樸先生之死，羣情憤激。青年學生尤難免感情用事。貴部負責治安，務祈鎮靜處理，以　羣情喁喁望治之心，專此奉覆。」（刊於十五日之觀察，正義，雲南等日報）</p>
<h3>兩次報告</h3>
<p>十五日下午一時，李公樸先生治喪委員會在雲大至公堂舉行大會，據學生報載稱：到會者千餘人，主席致詞後，即由李公樸夫人張曼筠女士報告，略謂：「他在死前，就知　　死。他出街時和我說：「我今天跨出了這道門，不知道能否跨進來。」所以，他早就有這種預感了！他問過我：「假若我死了，你怎麼打算」？我雖沒有說，但在心裏也早打算好了，——我決定跟着他繼續奮鬥。…他是我的好丈夫，我的好朋友。（慟哭）」張女士報告畢，最後由聞一多先生講演。聞氏首稱：「這幾天，大家曉得，在昆明出現了歷史上最卑劣最無恥的事情！李先生犯了什麽罪，竟遭此毒手？…這成什麽話？今天，這裏有沒有特務？你站出來，是好漢的站出來！你出來講：憑什麼殺死李先生？（厲聲，熱烈的鼓掌）屠殺了人，還要誣衊人，說什麼「桃色案件」，說什麼共產黨殺共產黨！（熱烈的鼓掌）末稱：我們要準備像李先生一樣，前脚跨出大門，後脚就不準備再跨進大門！」（載於二十一日學生報，該報係由昆明學生聯合會編輯兼發行）</p>
<p>十五日下午三時，民盟滇支部負責人，在府甬道民主周刊社招待各報記者，到十餘人。首由楚圖南報告，略謂今天招待各位記者，不願提出任何問題，也不願答覆任何問題。今天只報告李先生被害的經過及其生平。報告，略謂今天招待各位記者，不願提出任何問題，也不願答覆任何問題。今天只報告李先生被害的經過及其生平。報告畢，某記者問：近來街頭張貼之壁報標語，有謂此案是滇省警備總部所主使，貴支部對此有何意見？楚圖南答稱：這些壁報與本支部無關，我們致總部的覆函中，已申明此點。又問：貴支部對地方當局有何希望？答：希望治安當局鎮靜處理，緝兇破案，依法解決。另一記者問：街頭標語，有云李先生係共黨暗殺者，有云係國特暗殺者，貴支部是否獲知此事？答：不得而知。又問：有云此係出於情殺者？聞一多答稱：此乃誣衊之詞，人已死了，實不應再加誣衊。聞氏在記者招待會中，態度鎮靜，發言極少，連連招呼記者用茶點，新近整容的臉上，有時微露笑容。招待會於五時完畢，聞氏送記者至門口，一一握手道別。半小時後，聞氏忽又被暗殺殞命！</p>
<h3>聞一多　被刺經過</h3>
<p>十六日昆市各報，刊載兩條新聞，一為昆市警察局息，公佈聞氏被害經過如下：</p>
<p>「昨（十五）日下午五時三十分，聯大教授聞一多，偕其子聞義和，（記者按，此乃聞立鶴之誤）由府甬道十四號民主周刊社外出北向行進之際，突被一穿青色衣服，一穿灰色衣服之暴徒兩人，開槍狙擊，聞氏父子當即應聲倒地，暴徒向錢局街方向逃逸。崗警間聲追捕不獲，在肇事地點撿獲大拉八彈壳一只，盒子槍彈壳三只，當經將受傷之聞氏父子送　醫院救治。聞一多腹部中彈多發，於送醫院途中斃命。其子中彈五發，一腿已斷，不能言語。市警局　局長聞訊，即趕到出事地點查勘，暨分別加派幹員出動追緝兇犯，分報省市府及警備總部嚴緝歸案。」</p>
<h3>懸賞緝兇手</h3>
<p>另一消息，為警備總部懸賞緝兇啟事：「查近有反動份子，居心叵測，企圖擾亂社會治安，製造事件，圖謀不軌。本部責在保持地方治安，為求迅予破案起見，特登報懸賞緝兇。凡能捕獲兇犯解部法辦者，各獎法幣一百萬元。凡能聞風報訊因而緝獲者，各獎法幣五十萬元，破案之日，即行發給。」十六日和平日報載稱：滇省府亦懸賞五十萬元緝兇。</p>
<p>二十一日出版的學生報，刊載「聞一多先生被刺經過」一文，內稱：「據附近的居民說：行刺的暴徒不下五人，他們很早就潛伏在聯大教職員宿舍附近，早有幾個是隱伏在附近的一所米倉大門裏，俟聞先生偕公子經過，暴徒即前後包圍，集中射擊，見聞氏父子已倒臥血泊中，才登上一吉普車往錢局街逃逸。」</p>
<p>該報又載「聞先生家屬訪問記」，內述聞小姐（十三四歲）談稱：「那天，爸爸在府甬道十四號招待新聞記者，在四點鐘左右，大哥（指立鶴）從家裏出來接爸爸」在路上就見三個「特務」沿街徘徊，大哥把情形告訴了爸爸後，就暫等一下，過了一會，大哥再出來看看，見街上已沒有人，就隨同爸爸一齊回家。等走到距家（即聯大教職員宿舍）有二十多步的地方，見從錢局街那邊來了兩三個身穿藍布中山裝的彪形大漢，同時在後面也來了兩三個穿藍布裝的傢伙。不多時，槍就響了。第一槍打着爸爸的頭，爸爸馬上倒在地上，哥哥趕緊抓着爸爸，就在這時候，幾個「特務」就對着哥哥打了好幾槍，哥哥被打中後，仍舊爬起見，想跑回家裏去報信，但這時又被打中了一槍，哥哥見爸爸倒在地上，流血不止，口吐白沫，就回轉到爸爸的身旁，「特務」就對着爸爸亂打了四五槍，槍打後，那些「特務」就向兩邊跑了。」</p>
<h3>民盟人士　請美領館保護</h3>
<p>聞案發生後，民盟人士潘光旦·費孝通·楚圖南等聞訊，即在雲大電請美國駐滇總領事署，請求暫予保護，該館代理總領事麥加理，於當日（十五）午後七時赴滇省警備總司令部，說明此事。據聞麥氏稱：自李公樸聞一多暗殺案發生後，謠諑甚多，治安堪虞，有華人數名，為安全起見，到領署居住，請求保護，業已收容。十七日警備總部曾以備忘錄一件，送交麥加理，聞其內容如次：「本案發生後，本部正多方設法懸賞緝兇歸案究辦。查保境安民，維護治安，本部則無旁貸，貴署應無予以保護之必要。貴我國邦交，相極敦睦，復經並肩作戰，及中美平等新約之簽訂，中美關係更臻親善。貴署以領事身份，保護主權國人民，顯違中美平等新約精神，本部對貴署此項措施，深引為憾。茲向歸總領事申明，根據上述理由，應即將受保護人交本部依法保護。」數日後，聞潘光旦氏已自動離開美領館，居於清華辦事處內。二十一日晚，梅校長貽琦之包車伕，拉空車由外歸來，途遇便衣，盤問梅氏家住多少人，潘氏聞訊不安，又回至美領館。近數日中，聞民盟人士已離領署，由治安機關派兵保護其住處。</p>
<h3>一幕揷曲</h3>
<p>李聞兩案發生期中，曾有一幕揷曲。一中年孀婦，名張靜貞，年四十餘，滇省迤西人，在昆無固定住址，常寓旅館中，舊文學頗有根底，能背誦全部聖經，且能測字看相。李聞案發生前後，此一似瘋非瘋之婦人，曾在聯大雲大測字，散佈流言。她說聞一多之多字，拆開來　，夕上加一，為一歹字，她說他是歹人，要死在晚上。她又為雲大熊校長測字云：熊字從水，利於北，不利於南。有人傳說，熊氏提前離昆，或係受此影響。駐昆憲兵團問此訊，曾將此孀婦拘捕審訊，結果一無所獲。</p>
<h3>聯大常委會　對聞案態度</h3>
<p>聞案發生之後，西南聯大常委會推定查訓導長良釗，黃院長鈺生，沈總務長履等五人，組織聞一多教授喪葬撫卹委員會。二十一日昆市各報刊載該會發言人談話，略謂「本校中國文學系教授聞一多先生，不幸遇狙逝世，本校師生，均不勝悲悼。…頃已決定本月二十四日下午三時，在昆北大教室開會追悼，一本學校立場，表達師生哀痛之忱。其他團體，如有舉動，與本會及本校無關，本會亦無與其他任何團體合併有所舉動。聞先生喪葬費用及聞夫人聞公子醫藥費用：　由本校負責籌付，無須向外捐募。至撫恤一節，在辦法未定以前，亦決不募捐。」</p>
<h3>新團體的出現</h3>
<p>李聞兩案發生之後，昆市忽出現了幾個新團體，其中有「昆明李公樸聞一多兩先生血案後援會。」該會曾在二十一日學生報上，刊載「致美國爭取和平聯合委員會書」·「向全滇父老作沉痛呼籲書」·「上馬歇爾司徒雷登」。另有「雲南清流國學社」，亦散佈「為李聞慘案向全國同胞呼籲」傳單。還有一個「雲南人民正義社」，電請蔣主席懲兇。</p>
<h3>幾種傳說散佈</h3>
<p>國防部秘書長顏逍鵬氏，於十八日由京飛抵昆後，昆市即於十九日起發生了一些傳說。傳說滇省警備總部，破獲了幾個秘密組織，其中有一個××黨，和三個特務機構。另一個傳說，有謂楊立德之被捕，與李聞兩案有關。有謂楊之被捕，係因另一案件。這些傳說，在該案尚未破獲之前，固不足以作為事實的根據，但對滇垣人心之影響不小。二十三日晨，霍總司令飛廬山的消息，昆市各報均未公佈，於是又一傳說又起。或謂滇省府將改組，或謂霍氏不願再來。直至盧霍二氏於二十七日同機返昆之翌日，滇局將變之謠言始息。</p>
<h3>問題期待解決</h3>
<p>中樞對於李聞兩案，根據各方面的表示，極端關懷與重視。全國軍警憲最高主官，均已先後來昆，辦理破案工作，顏秘書長於二十二日離昆，翌日各報刊載中央社訊，云對二案，已得有確實綫索，不日全案當可大白。二十三至二十六日，警察總署唐署長縱在昆，繼續督查兩案。二十七日，蔣主席復特派顧總司令祝同率同憲兵司令張鎮，陸軍總部副參謀長冷欣來昆，全權處理。三氏蒞昆，迄今已達三日，現正聽取各方報告，詳細檢討案情。或謂案情複雜，牽涉甚大，想係此案迄今尚未公佈的最大原因。</p>

<p>望重視師資</p>
<p>編輯先生：</p>
<p>當上海正鬧着失業而又人才荒的今日，我要提出一個問題來！中國的社會恁的矛盾！尤其供求更是不能相需（雖然還有所謂職業介紹）。同樣性質的「召聘」與「待聘」廣告，往往會在報紙上先後輝映的一起發現，爲什麽不讓它們來一個合作呢！即以小學教師而論，報紙上，也時常見着一些「聘請」和「待聘」的廣告，足見「粉筆匠」也居然依樣了。其實合格的教師已不算多了，而待聘的偏大有人在。真是矛盾！前天報載，教局小學教師登記檢定結果，合格的固有，不少的還須來一個試騐檢定。這裏面當然包含着公私立小學全有，弄堂小學不說了，堂堂市立國民學校，似乎應儘量聘用合格教師，以免誤人子弟才對。很希望教育當局，不僅是發表「登記」合格而已，還請進一步注意到小學規程第六十八條，「於每學年開始兩個月前，公佈其資歷。」並令飭各市校，於聘請時「應以登記公佈者為限。」不久秋季開學，第二代被送入火坑的嚴重性，多少該能减低點。這在社會人士固然求之不得，賢明的教育當局，想來也不會否認這措施的應該，而且要批一個「速辦！」的吧！何况法令規定的呢！（繼柏）</p>
<p>賭聲擾鄰居</p>
<p>中國人喜賭，往往狂賭全夜，雀聲劈拍，令人不得安睡。余住北京西路，隔鄰甯渡人房屋，同余所居者一樣寬大，但雀牌聲已清淅如在自己房中。因時值夏令，窗戶皆開，傳聲極易，若隔一樓面為鄰，則聲音如在耳邊。雀牌之聲，劈拍刺耳，不算數，還要夾雜唱牌聲的甯波調，你唱過了我唱，我唱過了他唱，一直要到天明方始罷休，各鄰皆感此家討厭，若去干涉他們，不免要動氣惱。本來一個人遊樂也有限度，在十二時以前儘可大家胡鬧，但，人家要睡了，不能使人家受累。滬上不少此種情形，深望當局再加注意，應派警士沿街沿弄巡查無綫電聲及麻雀聲，若麻雀牌聲音已能刺入警察耳中，即已為擾人安睡之聲，可逕入禁止之。至於賭博是否犯禁，則亦須另行依法取締，請警局注意及之。（蔣一民）</p>
<p>新橋路擠塞</p>
<p>編輯先生：</p>
<p>新橋路為貫通新成與閘北兩區要道，近來攤販林立，穢物遍地，該處路面原極狹窄，致是更見車馬塞途，行人駐足，非但阻碍交通，更且有礙衛生，而　門沿戶，影響兩旁商店營業匪淺，特此函促當局注意，迅予取締。（沙吉人）</p>
<h3>我所知道的石津運河　七月廿六日天津訊</h3>
<p>— 毓新</p>
<p>石津運河，可以媲美塘沽新港，它的起點是石家莊（石門），終點在天津碼頭。日本為經營這工程，動員了許多日本內地技師來協助偽工務總署尅期完成，並使日軍與技師合作，不惜耗用大批工費，運輸鉅量資材，而使用華北大批廉價的伕子—說起來，是十二萬分痛心的，我們石德縣以及平漢綫四周左右十三縣的鄉民都曾受它們驅使「華北勞工協會」也曾助桀為虐，代為搜索民夫「華北交通工司」各站免費代運，可憐這一批批的縣民，死在中途以及染病困頓在工務總署集中蓆棚的，每天不知有幾千人，偽工務總署在石門柳辛莊站和石門黃壁莊間，都有輕便小型貨車負責裝運，這些民夫半途潛逃的，大半都被工警用槍打死，日本這種「武裝建設」徒使大批鄉民心理趨於惡化，這種罪惡暴虐的統治，無不遭人切齒痛恨！</p>
<p>然而，到現在，石津運河局部已經完工，在納粹被殲滅的前一個月—去年四月，偽工務總署石門工程局舉行了一次通水式，地點是在河北南部平山縣黃壁莊，在取水口上面高地，設立碑石，來紀念為該工程殉職人員，這些死者共計五十二名，偽總署的警備隊日本指導官，要佔五分之四。黃壁莊取水門有五個閘，水閘上安設捲揚機，事先都油漆得通紅的，那天由日本兩個部隊長，偽工程局長，日本負責者矢野以及兩個日本包工的主持開閘通水「大典」。當場這日本參事矢野致詞謂：「此項工程局部的已經完成，其他的尚待繼續努力，我們要向「日華」軍官民各位致謝並對這三年施工期間殉職者靈前，致其莫大的敬意。」</p>
<p>石津運河是在民國三十一年啟工，導水路這部分，分隧道，暗渠，開渠三階段，已經整個完竣。隧道之前，就是引水滹沱河水的取水口（包括五個水閘）至於日本想建立的一個取水堰堤Dam　至去年，只將「基　工」做了八成，爲了井筒沈下，並由黃河北岸借來不少不用的九米長大鐵軌，來壓沉這些鋼筋洋灰的井筒—井筒是堰堤下面的基礎—這工作相當繁重，由河床下層鑽探土質起，測量，繪畫，作井筒，壓沉，再增高，再壓沉。壓沉到相當於計劃的規定為止，然後動工，作Dam　日本人沒把它完成，怪可惜的，直到去年，它們改了計劃好多次，結果只敷衍「軍方面」，做了一個假取水工事，完事大吉。（假取水就是臨時通水）</p>
<p>它們並不是真不想把取水堰堤完成，原因是（一）地方治安不靖，施工地帶附近，遊擊隊的鬥士們遊戲三昧，時常光臨，（二）資材困難，偽工務總署大批購料，非經北京（日本興亞院）御准，以及日本皇軍各方認可才行。德國崩潰以前，一切軍需物資，遭逢到嚴格地統制，所以動工以來，即時感材料不足，然而竟讓此河通了水也就很不容易了。（三）日本技術的膽怯，日人監工走過工段，時常遇到遊擊隊優待他們而預置的地雷，經過數度冒險的受乍，也就畏縮却步不敢領教了。而且長途運輸的乘客汽車，也常受威脅，所以將計劃一再改訂，越來越偷工减料，希望速成，以圖减卸責任，它們施工計劃是如此，分成五個區段（見後列一表）</p>
<p>上述計劃，預定五年完成，截至去年四月止，不過畫好了一個輪廓，基本的堰堤，是沒有告成的。</p>
<p>施工地點河北平山縣管，地名黃壁莊。這運河總計劃是由黃壁莊引水到石門（石家莊）並在石德綫（石門東行到德州）沿綫晉縣　城兩地，利用新導水路引水灌溉耕地，促進棉麥增產。自晋　而東，與子牙河舊到合流，並將舊河道修濬舒暢以後，逆行而上，直達天津。這種計劃就是日本想運出貨物並鞏固沿綫地盤的野心。談到它的水源問題，原定地點在井陘縣威州鎮，修建貯水堰堤，就是利用滹沱河支流冶河之水，增建水庫，調劑水量。貯水堰堤預定用鋼筋混凝土做成。貯水總量一·二億立方米，有效貯水量是八二〇〇萬立方米，並利用此鉅量之水修建水利發電所一處，約計四千K.W.（電量）。</p>
<p>該河導水路部份，全長三〇公里，計有兩公里的隧道，暗渠五公里，此外則係開渠。敵偽時代，興修三年之久；算是完成，隧道口及取水口，均樹有橫石額各一方，是蘇體仁他們題的。</p>

<h3>浙江的急務　治安第一</h3>
<p>— 本報廿五日杭州訊　特派員儲裕生</p>
<p>當記者在本年四月初由上海到杭州來的時候，在火車中碰着一位滿腮鬢髭的紹典人，他說：「有幾縣鄕下着實不太平，什麼游擊隊，新四軍攪一個不淸，現在雖是勝利了，但這批吃慣便宜飯的人，誰肯再回老家去辛辛苦苦的種田呢？」來浙江已將是四個月了，在四個月中，却滿耳都是盜匪出沒洗刦的新聞，我曾去浙西平原地帶，縣政當局也承認對於治安的問題感到棘手。以故杭州市的報紙上，差不多天天以大字標題揭載盜匪搶刦的消息，不是公路上的客車被搶了；便是江河裏的汽划子被刦了；航船被盜了；住家的東西被搬走了；甚至縣自衛隊譁變了；遊客的手飾被拿去了。最近，我在上海×報上看到一節副刋特稿，內有一篇文章，以「浙道難」來命題的，當然這篇文章裏，一定有很多地方叙述交通路綫上治安的大成問題。</p>
<p>吃慣便宜飯誰肯去辛苦種田</p>
<p>浙江省政府主席沈鴻烈氏，他也覺得當前浙江的最急要措施莫如治安問題的解決。的確，如果治安沒有辦法，一切都將停頓，好像一個人若血脈不流通，便要死了。洽安問題已被提出後，記者曾多次與浙省當局接觸，知道這事已與衢州綏靖公署商得具體辦法，即兩省交界處的盜匪，由兩省派隊會剿，由綏署派員指揮，主要幹綫之盜匪，由綏署派隊淸剿，縣與縣間的盜匪由行政督察專員公署剿辦，縣境內散匪由縣府淸剿，股匪由省保安隊淸剿，此項經費，省定爲三千萬元，又散兵游勇，由縣收容送回原籍，其屬外省者，由鄰縣轉送隔省者由鄰省轉送。最近省府舉行的全省行政會議，復決定聯保制，即一戶戶均具結聯保，保證不容留歹匪，並決定淸鄕經費爲一萬萬元。沈主席也曾對記者說。「現在的盜匪，眞正土匪的少，散兵游勇的多，道些散兵游勇，有的是編餘官兵，外籍多於本籍，有的是編餘游擊隊有的是裁汰的僞軍，本籍多於外籍，這些人總要使他們能復員就業，浙江的治安才有辦法」。但正如這位紹興人說：「這批吃慣便宜飯的人，誰肯回家去辛辛苦苦地種田呢」？</p>
<p>匪盜尙匿跡　災患日益加深了</p>
<p>本來，浙江可說很少匪患，雖然從前傳說仙居　縣兩處有土匪，但究也不十分嚴重，只因浙東山鄕交通不便，所以傳有匪患者有之。但當時浙西的太湖之匪時常出沒，擾害嘉興吳興各屬，民國十八九年時，有所謂太保阿書者即在太湖一帶稱霸一時，因爲太湖不屬一省管豁，而且面積很廣，湖匪極易匿跡。另爲溫台一帶的海盜，亦極著名的。不過他們往往出沒於海面之上，與浙江省內似很少關係。其他仙霞嶺因爲是閩浙交界的關係有時也感到不寗，但也並不太形嚴重。抗戰期中，大家都從事抗戰，只有敵僞軍的騷擾，有時「新四軍」也來閙一下。總算也沒有盜匪如毛的現象。現在，在抗戰勝利及年的今天，浙西的湖匪程度加深了，浙東的仙霞嶺交界處不必說，而溫台一帶的括蒼山，上虞，餘姚，奉化，寗波，嵊縣，新昌，慈豁七縣交界的四明山更是不甚安寗，聽說四明山敵人和「新四軍」都曾住過。這座山面積甚大，山內很深，「新四軍」曾創「川山政策」就是在四明山，天目山，會稽山這三個山打成一片，則可囊括浙東十餘縣。可是這些計劃沒有成功，據當地有幾位人士對我談：其實當時也沒有共產黨，共產黨只來幾個人，把當地的一些土匪散兵游勇，偽軍流氓組織一下罷了。</p>
<p>現在的盜匪，誠如沈鴻烈氏所言，是散兵游勇，但這許多散兵游勇，這樣的擾亂來，也足以釀成大患的。而且勝利後的政治，實在不能令人感覺十分滿意，捐稅層層地加在人民身上，而對人民的生命財產却絲毫沒有保障，怎叫人能够忍耐的生活下去。自然有的也挺而走險了。</p>
<h3>淸剿嫌不足　政治亦需要修明</h3>
<p>所以雖然是一個治安問題，但其牽涉到很廣泛的，我們剛是淸剿是不足的，還要政治修明，實在講，政治修明就可以遏止亂源的。當然在現在這一個階段，我們並不反對淸剿，我們要廉潔的政治與淸剿散匪兼併實施。不要因爲淸剿的關係，挾嫌誣害，不要因爲淸剿的關係，成立很多淸鄉的機構，反而來向人民需索，這都是不對的。正如沈鴻烈氏所言，現在要「與民休息」，所以要淸鄉，是要去剷除擾民不安的歹徒，來「與民休息」。</p>
<p>我們要求政府積極收容散兵游勇，遇服裝不整齊，不佩符號的軍人一律扭送收容所，並且要獎勵老百姓如此作。我們要求政府嚴格管制四明山，天目山，會稽山等地區，以免歹徒藏身。我們希望浙江回復到安居樂業的時代</p>
<p>有一位朋友有些氣憤的說：「旣然國共仍舊要打，那麼何必要裁軍縮編，以致於編餘裁汰的兵員們如此胡閙，使我們浙江如此的不安。「但裁汰兵員到底是國家必要之政，我們到底不希望國共眞的打起來，我們寗願想辦法解決我們目前的痛苦。</p>
<h3>浙行政會議全貌</h3>
<p>— 廿一日杭州訊　本報記者黃行天</p>
<p>「十九省區報災荒，三千萬人在饑餓。」今日中國的現狀，已臻於破產的地步了，可是竟還有人在不顧民生疾苦，蓄意內亂！單就浙江來說，我們翻開省會杭州的報紙，每天都有匪徒行刧，災情慘重之類的新聞，借用沈主席自己的話，他視察了五個行政區，計二十餘縣之後，「看到各縣縣城及大鎭市多被敵寇澈底破壞，各地童山濯濯，水利失修，民食不足，洽安不良，對於軍糧之負担，尤感竭蹶，而各縣縣府多借住民房，學校多借用廟宇，警保衣食缺乏，公敎人員生活艱窘，百廢待舉，而一錢莫名……」人民的苦痛，政府的困難，盡在他底話裏了。可是怎樣才能打破這個難關呢？沈主席視事甫及三月，即行召開全省行政會議，其最大動機，即在蘇解民困，在替患着嚴重底貧血症的地方政府，找一貼對症良藥。</p>
<h3>行政會議　猶如醫師會診</h3>
<p>「浙江是個健康的人，不過現在患着嚴重的傷寒病，官吏本來就是醫生，行政會議就等於醫生會議。」這些醫生們對於浙江這個病人的處理，是根據沈主席的指示，從五個中心問題着手。第一個問題是民政，主要的是以整理地籍戶政，健全基層組織，裁併冗員機構，提高公敎人員待遇，縮小警保編制來推進行政效力。第二個問題是財政。解決財政的困難是目前行政工作的急務，他們認爲除正當課稅經中央厘定者須遵照征收整辦外，首須廢除苛雜，嚴禁攤派，剔除糧政積弊，簡化辦事程序，依照中央規定，非經地方民意機關通過，幷呈奉省府核准，不得任意取之於民。方今瘡痍滿目，目前要務，重在與民休息，不急之事，儘可緩辦，擾民之舉，必須戒除。省府對財政之措施，以「量入爲出」爲平衡收支之道，故需節流，以减輕人民負担。第三個問題是敎育。咸認爲以改進質量爲主，因浙江原有敎育基礎，多被戰火摧殘，不但校舍不足，設備短少，而且敎師們多掙扎在飢餓綫上，自難安心供職。且因人材都集中於都市，小學師資缺乏，已成普遍現象，今後各縣中等敎育，固應力圖充實，即國民敎育方面，亦必須待遇標準化，基　制度化，以期取之於鄉，用之於鄕。第四，建設問題，首在開闢水利，以禦天災；增產五谷，以裕民食。抗戰以來，歷年林木被砍極衆，河道壅塞亦多，目前水患，雖已可觀，但尚屬初步，如果循此不治，後患將不堪設想，故各縣小型與大型水利，必須量力並舉，以期轉禍爲福。浙江雖號富庶之鄉，而今食糧猶需仰給鄰省，不能自給，殊不合理，故須提倡冬耕，開闢荒地，以謀面積增產，改良種籽，防治病蟲，以謀單位增產。第五，是保安問題，剿匪雖已二月，猶鮮成效，其根本辦法，在拔源塞流，標本兼施，始以法治，繼以德化，生聚敎訓，使人民不能爲匪，不必爲匪，亦不肯爲匪。</p>
<h3>一萬萬元　撥充清鄉經費</h3>
<p>現在省府決定以一億元撥充淸鄉經費，以各縣治安狀况（百分之四十）人口總數（百分之三十）土地面積（百分之二十）交通狀况（百分之十）爲分配標準，將全浙各縣分爲十等，計甲等一縣撥一七五萬元，乙等四縣各撥一六五萬元，丙等三縣各撥一五五萬元，丁等四縣各撥一四五萬元，戊等八縣各撥一三五萬元，已等十三縣各撥一二五萬元，庚等十二縣各撥一一五萬元，辛等十三縣各撥一〇五萬元，壬等十二縣各撥九五萬元，癸等七縣各撥八五萬元，各縣須已百分之二十為辦公費百分之三十為聯保切結等印刷費，百分之四十爲清鄉川　費，百分之十為雜支，清勦和聯保是對付「股匪」和「盜匪」的，對於散丘游勇，則令收容，所需食米，每人每日廿五兩，副食費暫按每人月支四千元，由各縣積穀項下動支；其遣送回籍之行旅費，由省府另撥五千元。淸鄕也好，聯保也好、其目的在减輕人民痛苦而不能徒增人民痛苦，過去的工作顯然辦得不很好，省臨參會林秘書長就說過：「現在各鄉農村簡直亂得不像個世界！」今日抱「救民於水火」之雄心來，治浙的賢明長官們，是應該深爲警惕的。</p>
<h3>財政收支　多方緊縮平衡</h3>
<p>其次，是財政收支的平衡問題。老百姓經過八年抗戰的苦難，已是精疲力盡，對於中央的徵實和地方的苛雜，已感到不勝負担，先後有十區代表來杭請求减賦區代表來杭請求免征實物，而政府呢，一面要供應軍糧，一面要常年經費，各機關俱有人不敷出之感。因此會議中有人要求，各縣得以應實際需要，設置因地制宜之賦稅，而不採取「通過稅」與「入境稅」之方式，但終因民政廳長阮毅成的堅決反對而未獲通過。所以，對於財政措施、還是量入為出，照明年度預算，省府約需二百八十餘億，而收入僅一百八十餘億；縣級預算約需五百五十餘億，而收入祗有四百餘億。其不足之數，擬多方緊縮以平衡之。至於征收實物，除依法應收「征實」「征借」「省縣公糧」及「地主積殼」外，不得假借名義，另作征派或變相之帶征</p>
<p>由於政府經費之拮據，公敎人負待遇的低落，已成爲一般的現象，二區專員於樹巒曾向大會報告：「縣級人員待遇最高的是吳興，但月薪三百元之縣長，連加成（一〇五倍）生補（三一，〇〇〇元）等費，不過六萬三千餘元，最低的是長與，月薪五〇元之職員，連加成（六〇倍），生補（二〇，〇〇〇元）等費不過二萬三千元。鄉級人員待遇，亦以吳興最高，但月薪八〇元之職員連加成（一〇五倍）生補（三一，〇〇〇元）等費，不國三萬九千餘元；德清最低，月薪四五元之職員，連加成（三五倍）生補（一〇，〇〇〇元）等費，僅一萬一千餘元。在這樣的窘狀之下，不是造成無官不貪之現象，便陷工作於「半身不遂狀態」。因此，他大聲呼籲，中央祇知道提高中央公務員待遇而不顧省，省不管縣級公務員待遇，而縣又不去顧鄉！總之沒有通盤籌劃……」現經大會決議：「縣級公敎人負待遇，分五十元加成二四〇倍，最低四萬元，以四五，六月份當地平均米價為區別標準，鄉鎮級人員爲縣級之七成。」數字是增加了，但仍追不上物價，看來非至大局澄淸，匪患絕跡，國泰民安的時候，公務員是祇好苦守一輩子了。</p>
<h3>消弭水患　舉辦防洪工程</h3>
<p>水患成災，也是浙江的嚴重問題，因爲本省地勢西南高聳而多山，東面臨海而多平原，全省山地面積達一億零七百餘萬畝，佔全省陸地面積百分之七十六，故西南各縣，耕地缺乏。而全省森林面積，據戰前實業部之統計，不及一千萬畝，山地荒禿，水源無從涵蓄，　雨則山洪暴發，平原遂成澤國；久旱則田地龜裂，赤土千里。抗戰後，食糧調濟困難，毀林燒懇之風益盛，水旱災害，愈趨愈烈。故急需厲行造林，保林，實施圍墾以保水土，防治水旱災害，而安民生。建設廳並以興修各縣防洪工程及小型農田水利爲中心提案，其具體辦法，先就爲患最烈之各主要河流，自本年起先行舉辦緊急防洪治標工程；乘本年冬林農閑，利用國民義務勞動服役辦法，辦理全部防洪工程，及征集必要材料。其主要防洪地區爲（一）錢塘江上游：由江山·常山·開化·衢縣·龍游·湯溪·建德·桐盧·新登·富陽·金華·浦江·諸豊等縣會同辦理；（二）浦陽江·由諸暨蕭川·浦江·義烏等縣會同辦理，（五）新安江：由淳安·建德·壽昌·遂安等縣會辦；（四）　江·由東陽·義烏·金華·蘭谿·永康·武義·湯溪等縣會辦；（五）曹娥江，由紹興·上處·　縣·新昌·東陽等縣會辦，（六）東西　溪，由安吉·孝豊·長興·吳典·德淸·餘杭·臨安·武康等縣會辦，（七）靈江·由黄岩·臨海·天台·仙居等縣會辦；（八）甌江·由慶元，龍泉，麗水·靑田·遂昌·松陽·缙雲·景寗·宣平等縣會辦；（九）飛雲江·由平陽·瑞安·泰順等縣會辦，（十）鰲江，由平陽縣辦理，至於小型農田水利工程，平原各縣以灌溉排水爲中心；山區各縣以中央倡導之挖塘蓄水及條繕閘　等引水工程爲中心，各縣市每年平均以受益農田五千畝，全省每年完成三十八萬餘畝爲目標。平原灌溉河流及圩堤，一律疏浚培修完成；山區無水原高田，卅六年起由完成一保一塘，達到二十畝一塘之目標。</p>
<h3>大會通過　三年建設計劃</h3>
<p>除以上四個衆所注目，急待解決的中藥問題之外，大會還通過了浙江三年建設計劃，卅六年度工作計劉綱要，卅五年度下半年中心工作計劃網要，及其他建設性提案數十件。由浙江現在的病狀看來，「醫生會議」議決的那劑藥方雖不是「仙丹」，但可預期有相當的成效，是必然的事，而其成功的程度，主要的還得看「醫生」們服侍得如何。診斷是一件事，治療又是一件事，如果沒有謹慎的熱心的照顧，專心盡力地治療，病是不會有起色的。議而已經決了，我們還深望決而能夠行。國父雖倡導和難行易的學說，但如果沒有大勇氣，沒有大毅力，行也是不易的。所以沈主席在閉幕詞中向各廳處首長，專員縣長等以「致知力行」相勵外，更以「任勞任怨」相勉。的確，對於浙江這樣一個患着嚴重的傷寒症的病人，如果「體生」們再不肯任勞任怨，前途就不堪設想了！</p>

<h3>廬山之夏</h3>
<p>— 平齋</p>
<p>自後民國二十六年夏天之後，我們不能再專拿看風景名勝的眼光來看廬山了。</p>
<p>八年轟轔烈烈的抗戰，在廬山寫下了光榮的序幕。廬山，從此以從，已經成為中華民族復興史上一個不朽的名字。這個名字將永遠象徽着統一，英勇，勝利，光榮。</p>
<p>今夏，廬山正面臨着勝利之後第一個夏天．在九年冷落之後，這中國的﹁夏都﹂蘇醒了。</p>
<p>勞苦功高的蔣主席夫婦回到了舊遊之地。而且中國真正的友人馬歇爾元帥，也到了這美麓的夏都，他夙夜辛勤的努力，將永遠在全中國民眾的記憶中存在。</p>
<p>司徒雷登大使步行着到</p>
<p>主席行轅呈遞了國書，這是在外交史上空前的一件事——司徒大使為外交史增添了空前的風韻：但願以後在國際上折衝樽　之間，讓這種真摯與簡樸永遠代替了繁文縟節！</p>
<p>接着，挪威的奧爾大使，阿富汗的公使，先後到達，呈遞了國書。不久，英國的新大使斯蒂文遜爵士也將接踵而來了。</p>
<p>九年前，廬山帶給過我們統一；今天，我們深深相信，廬山一定會使這個統一更鞏固，更永久！</p>

<h3>奪調重彈</h3>
<p>— 西廷</p>
<p>—聽音樂，學音樂！</p>
<p>人不分窮富，都有他未能盡如人意的事情，因此每個人有每個人的難題和苦悶。解救遵煩悶的方法，只有以精神的滿足，來彌補這現實的缺陷。此之謂精神的滿足，不是宗敎，不是道德觀念，而是藝術。——生活離不開科學，尤離不開藝術。</p>
<p>藝術自然不只音樂一門，但這里所指的只是音樂。音樂之於藝術，最抽象也最直覺，它直接地引起人心的共鳴　音樂的本身只是空氣的振動，但這振動，直接地觸動人們耳膜和心臟。當你聽完了一首進行曲，我問你「起了共鳴沒有？」也許你會回答說：「我並沒叫起來。」但是我却明明看見你當交饗樂隊高奏進行曲時，你的身子在節奏地搖動，你的脚在踏着同樣的節拍，因此你的心的跳動也快起來了。</p>
<p>——這就是共嗚。共嗚的時候，你把世俗的煩悶，都置諸身外了。</p>
<p>時在此時，地在此地，使你傷心的事情太多了，長此以往地傷心下去，會引起極度的神經衰弱，應有個補救方法。我不勸大家逃避現實，逃避責任，但我以爲目前在上海，精神病院，設備簡陋，收費又昂，患輕性的精神病的，如入病院，旣犯不着，一般人也沒這習慣；最好的方法該是使自己常有陶醉的時候，使神經有鬆弛的時候。道就是聽樂或者學音樂。音樂不是藥品，不會立即見效，但它却是一種營養品，長期的吸收，可以使你的生命更豐盛</p>
<p>在上海，唯一的交響樂隊（市府交響樂團）每週有固定的兩次演奏，爲了顧到聽衆的興趣，所奏的節目大都很Popular，不致有很多人不能接受。而且他們在固定的練習時間，免費招待各界，更何樂而不聰？</p>
<p>在上海，租鋼琴，私人敎授音樂，所在多有；如不是生活十分艱苦，那麼你在學校課本之外，正式職業之外，抽一個時間學習音樂，俱太理想！</p>
<p>一寫音樂文章，難免老生舊調，但舊調仍有重彈的必要！</p>
<h3>今後的出版事業</h3>
<p>— 王平陵</p>
<p>提倡學術，振興文化，雖然要有思想自由，學術獨立的精神；可是，依然十分股切地需要政府切實的獎進，有計劃的倡導，更需要有健全而負責的文化機構，博大精深的文化政策，不遺餘力地爲文化界服務，團結全國文化工作者在張開建設新中國的大旗下，準對百分之百有利於國族生存的方向，盡到最善的努力。醫如，關於科學專著的印行，系統地翻譯域外的哲學文學的名著，計劃地編譯科學敎本及叢醫，大量發行通俗的科學讀物，就決不是一般的出版家所能勝任，非由政府出全力來祖當不可，祇有打開了研究科學的風氣，使科學的常識，已爲民衆生活所必需，才能爲一般的出版界開闢一條獲利的大路，轉向於科學的提倡與印行；但在今天不能不仰仗於政府。</p>
<p>建設新中國，必須有最新的智慧，最進步的科學知識和技術，政府在獎進學術的計劃中，就得密切適合建國的需要而執行其光榮的任務，如仍舊是戰戰競競，惟恐國故失傳，僅以做到保存國粹爲能事，是非常不够的！</p>
<p>（四）今後的希望</p>
<p>生活在黑夜裏的人類，總覺得有一個希望像太陽似的縣在頭頂，就算太陽的光一時被烏烟療氣所遮蔽，變成漆黑的夜，相信發光的太陽是不會消滅的；所以，人類都有一股耐勁，咬緊牙齦，忍受一切可能遭遇的災難，等待烟霧的撲滅，光明的來臨。我一向就有這樣一個不可動搖的信念，從不悲觀，永過是抱着熱烈的希望，期待着有一個光輝的明天。同樣，我也相信，中國的文化，此刻雖然在戰後蕭條的廢據裘，呈現着空前的衰頹；雖然在大戰甫平，禍亂又起的浩刧中，問蒙着慘淡的愁霧，不過，值得告慰的，中國的年靑人受了八年血火的洗禮，已能辨得出是非，看得淸曲直，認得明眞僞，至少他們不會盲從了，他們無所求於誰，因此也決不懼怕誰的面目可憎，而有所戒心，他們相信人吃人的時代，畢竟過去了，巳有胆量憑自己的知覺與良心，經過「看貨色，貨比貨」的結果，拿出大公無私的判斷了。待遺種大公無私的判斷，已存在於超利害的老百姓的心窗，無論你是怎樣的不服氣，如何的眼紅，忌妒，而必思有以構陷，誣蔑那些扣鼎的成就，也免徒然的勞苦。因爲道樣，今後的文化事榮，大家都在萬目睽睽下，公開的擺下擂台，作公開的比賽，祇要你有「眞貨色」，一千個放心吧！決不會被埋沒！今後無論是泥塑的，木雕的，裝合的……各式各樣的偶像，早被大時代的鐵鞭，打得粉碎，或另行改作了解使的馬桶，儘管也塗滿了輝煌的金色；然決不會再混亂我們的觀綫了，決不會使你被他們的金色所歲脅，一聽到這些人的大名，就自動地解除了「元龍的豪氣」，問這些把偶際改作的馬桶，頂禮膜拜了！</p>
<p>在今天無論什麼人，小伙子，老頭子，男的，女的，……祗要你捨得對某一種學問，某一件事業，不取巧，不投機，盡心力而爲之，能够耗費你全生命的三分之二的年齡，我包管你必有顯耀的成就；而且遵稱成就，是與地球同終始的成就，祇有天算地合，才可以燬滅你的成就。像道樣一個心理上的大轉變，我確認是締這新中國的新動機，不僅是中國的文化從此可以蒸蒸日上的因素。可是，得來眞不容易呵！要知道，這都是經過八長年的血戰，二千萬人的鮮血換來的呵！</p>
<p>目前政局的動盪不寗，自然能使各方面感受些許不良的影響；但我們不能放棄一切，靜待少數人的欲望滿足以後，再開始趕做我們應做的工作。政局即長此動邊，我們還是要活下去的，我們不能因爲他們的欲望未達而投河上吊，我們爲什麽不能在他們尚未波及的乾凈土，積極建設呢！</p>
<p>如果要建設的話，自然還是祈望「不在其位，不謀其政！」的老百姓，肯努力，肯幹，能够不存絲亳依賴的念頭，在各種應異應革的工作上，作勇往無前的邁進。我們不必過分爲今人躭憂，祇有認定必須要做，不得不做的工作，努力幹自己的。</p>
<p>無論如何，中國和文化發達的美國，經過了長期間的並肩作戰，多少已有了一些獲步。今後讀書者的數字，必較戰前和戰時，增加若干倍，或由於生活水準的提高，逼迫着大家不能不具備一些知識和技能，作爲爭取生存的資本。</p>
<p>是無疑的；何况，廣大淪陷區敵僞用以麻醉靑年的敎料書及出版物，自不能再聽其毒害人心。這樣說，僅靠後方幾個出版家的書，供給戰後全國的需要，照常識來判斷，當其感不足。但求政爭平息，天下太平，國人求知的慾望，必然如飢如渴，尤甚於過去的五四時代；所以，中國的出版界祗須好自爲之，一定是有光輝的前途的！（績完）</p>
<h3>小木屐</h3>
<p>— 拉馬丁著　錫壽譯</p>
<p>我們帶了孩子們去遊山，一直登到分開我們的深谷和沙納大山谷的那些山上的最高處。</p>
<p>山峯曆曆叠叠的矗立着，好像上帝的手用麵粉捏成的。那些山上蓋着塔松和山毛鄉，有幾處開着黄色的金雀花，彷彿一張鍍金的風景片，除此之外，還有一簇一簇的紫色的　木，和淡綠的細草地，還望去像鷄那樣大小的　羊，染白了草地。泡沫發光的小瀑布到處可以見到，他們的水道夾在蒼翠茂密的山毛樺，栗樹，柳樹的屏障裏，由山上流到山下。</p>
<p>我們在高處望得見白嶺（註）和整條阿爾卑山脈上蓋着永恒的白雪。我的丈夫是同了衛兵步行的，我同孩子們騎在驢子上，由幾個少年帶領着前進，那些　子是我們的朋友—那個年老的敎區理事的。他認識那些小路，一路上由他指揮。要達到最高的山巔，須費三小時，但是以前從我的窗口望去，似乎很容易攀登，只要半小時就能達到。在山上的距離正如生命裏的時間，往往會欺騙人的。不過時間的騙人與距離的騙人是相反的；人家以爲那些山是低的，實際很高；人家以爲時間是長的，實際很短；時間似乎是無邊無際的，但是一忽兒已經過去了。</p>
<p>我們和孩子們把整整的一天如此消磨掉：走一程，在草地上坐一回，瞻望着高處的美景，麥松奶村裏的白邱上，遠遠地傳來報午的鐘聲；在白闌斯村有無垠的草地，好像在荷蘭公使館當秘書的哥哥，當我們幼小時候，他從那裏寄來的風景片；白嶺依了時辰和太陽，變換着顏色，有時作白色，有時作玫瑰色，有時作紫色；宛如一塊鐵在爐子裏變換着顏色，一回見呈白，一回兒呈紅。</p>
<p>我們這一批人，主人和鄕人一同在草地上野餐。飯後，我們重新上了驢背，取着另一條通道絕頂的在野榧樹間的小路回來。</p>
<p>驢蹄擊着岩石的聲音，孩子們的歡呼，我丈夫和衛兵打紅色的竹鷄擊的槍聲，嚇走了烏鶴的齋嗚。敎區理事和少年間的會話，在我們這隊人馬前閙成一片大聲音，人家也許會以爲我們是一隊在山上巡行的强盜。也許就爲這點，恐嚇了那些在我們經過的榧樹旁邊看羊的孩童。</p>
<p>走了不多一會兒，我們望見小路上面的一塊無遮蓋的空地上，有幾羣沒有牧童看守的羊，由兩隻黑狗看守着。他們朝我們恐怖地吠叫。再遠些，我們看見在小路中央，兩塊大石之間有一堆已經熄滅的火灰，在旁邊放着兩雙小木屐，那是這地方的孩子所穿的。我們馬上會意到那些孩子，從他們底茅屋出來看羊的孩子，離開這裏並不達。我們猜他們一定被榧樹底下發出的不常聞的人聲和槍聲嚇走了，他們大槪是急急忙忙地藏匿在灌木中，來不及穿他們的木屐。我想給他們一個出其不意的贈禮，這個頭孩子們也覺得很好。於是，我們趕緊走到熄滅的火堆旁；我的丈夫在每一只木屐裏放了一個銀角子，我的女孩子把帶來的小吃糖漬杏子投一把在木屐要。繼而，我們繼續趕路，一邊談着逃走的小牧童底驚奇和快樂，當我們走了好久，不再聽見什麼，他們安心地回到原先看守那些羊羣的地方。穿他們的木屐時，他們一定猜想這些東西是常常來往於這個山上的仙女，棲息在夜霧中的仙女經過這地方時，贈給他們的。走下汨汨的水窪時，我們的孩子大笑起來了，他們料想着牧童的恐懼和驚奇，猜測他們的喜悅，和將在晚上向他們的母親訴說一</p>
<p>我們所料想的事情畢竟寬現了。那兩個小牧童回去穿木屐時，發現木屐裏裝着糖果和銀角子，迷惑起來，以爲是仙女的賜與。但他們的父母並不迷惑，他們拿了鄕人所有的輕巧方法來還報我們賦與的驚奇，表示他們曉得我們底好意。</p>
<p>翌日早長，我們的僕人推開那扇向着沒有牆垣的院子開的大門時，在門外的戶限旁發現四只草心編成的小籃，裏面裝滿了榧子，羊酪和做成小木屐形的奶油麵包。這一定是那些孩子偷偸地放下了他們底禮物，逃走開來，不過想以謎語還報謎語，以神秘還報神秘，以禮物還報禮物。這種匿了名巧捷地送來的小禮物，使我們又愉快又惶惑，我們實在不知道那些孩子住在哪一所茅屋裏，這些懦怯的——惟恐舛錯了對象的謝意，也不知是誰拿來的。但他們寗願舛錯，不願不還敬。</p>
<p>這種鄕人和號稱爲富人之間的互敬，是多麽的淸白啊，把我們底孩子們的心都感動了。</p>
<p>註：白嶺（Mont　Banc）爲歐洲阿爾卑羣山之最高的山巔拉馬丁的母親常常同了丈夫和孩子去遊山，回來時把她美麗的印象記下。上面就是她兒子所發表出來的一頁遊記。</p>
<h3>諦聽的女郎</h3>
<p>— 格羅斯作（一七二五—一八〇五）</p>
<p>陳列於倫敦華拉斯美術院</p>
<p>格羅斯爲法國一無名畫師之子，生於多尼，後至巴黎，因作歷史盡，稍享聲名。三十歲時，往遊義大利，歸國以後，曾作有關義大利生活之盡幅甚多。格氏作品，以描寫少年女郎之盡像爲最知名，本幅「諦聽的女郎」，即爲其一。其所作女郎盡像，蘊有一種特殊的新顥作風，故幾可謂已自成一種典型。格氏所盡，大抵只及於女郎頭肩二部，各盡不但狀貌相似，且其作風與手法，亦復相類，雖然體態色澤，常多變化。</p>
<p>格氏所盡女郎，雖皆屬少女單純之典型，但皆從不以單純描寫；雖皆稚年天眞，但常多顯露一種性感的風韻與誘惑，此固爲作者一大特色。格氏生前，迄未成名，晚年窮困潦倒以終。</p>
<h3>夜簡</h3>
<p>— 楊廉沅</p>
<p>素手輕彈失去韻致的七弦，我想你心裏蘊藏有說不盡的哀愁。</p>
<p>爲什麼你七弦的旋律，如是急躁，忽又變得如是鬱鬱呢？</p>
<p>雨中的向晚，我是瘦損了。</p>
<p>告訴你，我剛從一個苦難的夢裏蘇醒</p>
<p>那個小城，它和所有其它的小城一樣，古老，殘破，氲氤着一份憂鬱的氣息。請不要忘記它也保存我們國家所特有淳樸。</p>
<p>現在，我想借自己拙劣的畫筆來描繪一番這小城了：</p>
<p>我是從另一個小城，順着山溪，搭乘着被稱爲交通船底帆船上這小城去的。</p>
<p>在迷離的睡夢中，我給一陣尖銳的海螺聲吹醒，醒轉來就覺得迎面有冰冷的寒風襲來，遂記得昨天凭船舷，閑眺溪畔紅葉的情緒了，一絲暮秋的寞落之感乃又襲上心頭。</p>
<p>是不是感到凄凉了呢？不，那是浪遊人的行脚踏上一塊新土常有的感情，親切又似陌生，說是喜悅又有些微空虛。</p>
<p>我是站在碼顯的沙灘上了。靈山阻住了親綫，綠林夾雜着艷紅的楓葉。山，雄偉的山，呵，我是在山之國長大的。</p>
<p>你可以想像得到山溪從山溪從遙遙的山國裏奔流出來，通過這小城時，它已在入海之中途了。山溪通常總是以平穩底旋律輕唱她自已識成的樂曲，應該知道，遵時候，溪水是深湛的藍色，藍得像透明的藍實珠，但比寳珠更其鮮明。</p>
<p>於是我走在山城的街上。</p>
<p>有人說：「貧窮使得人們自私和猜忌，」對呵，那末你可以想像得到這躲藏在山國中小城底居民了。</p>
<p>小城的居民是貧窮的。</p>
<p>但是，他們還是保有一份淳樸的氣質，這很簡單，他們的生活並不完全建築在人與人之間的榨取上，很多的居民，都有足够一家子食用的糧食，用自已的手耕耘得來的糧食。</p>
<p>他們的生命和土地有着緊緊的關聯。這小城的少女眞够迷人呢。這樣說來，你會笑我是淺薄得近乎無聊了麼？</p>
<p>我說過是在暮秋的季節，駐足到這小城去的，那一年應該是戰爭開始底第五個年頭吧，前方的戰事情况緊得很這小城也不免受到渡動。不過，那年的冬天，一個嚴寒的冬天，終究度過去了。春三月，小城。</p>
<p>想着：繞滿了葛藤和葛蘿的樓房，黄昏張開它黑色的羽翼，包圍住這幢樓房，庭園的碧桃花合攏了，她淺笑的花瓣，一池水遂也有春天的氣息，給黄昏的風吹得微微起皺。外邊石板道上的夜歸客，他們細心得怕踏死一隻蟻螻似地，輕捷的走去，眞是靜極了，這時，你應該發見殘留西邊山頗的紅霞是褪盡了，暮色完完全全制伏了西山，此刻我說那樓房的桐油燈也應該亮了吧！</p>
<p>是的！油燈是亮了，並且還發出「必剝」的聲響，窗邊隱約着一個憂響的孩子，一個少女。</p>
<p>她呵，千八歲的年紀，這年靑的生命卻有了這麽多的苦楚和說不盡的哀愁。稅吧，從她身上我們也窺見了這小城；那一份新生的力受着舊的沒落的勢力底脅迫的掙扎。</p>
<p>這少女是憂鬱的，但更是迷人。</p>
<p>我親迷人，倒是說她的性格，通過她美麗的外貌我更觸及她美麗的靈魂。</p>
<p>她，就像一塊新土，散放着坭土的醇香，貞靜，質樸，說不盡的讚美呵，她的素手輕彈悲哀的調子了。她的調子竟敎春三月黄昏氳氤了深秋落寞的氣息。這少女是够悲哀的，她的不幸也就是這小城的不幸。和隨戰爭俱來的悲劇。</p>
<p>唉，我說，我是從隔樓偸聽她彈奏七弦琴的，到第二天黄昏，我們是成爲一雙要好的朋友了：……。</p>
<p>戰爭的年代是悠長的，多難的時代，感情的野馬開始奔馳時，我們畢竟還能够收住牠的。</p>
<p>那些日子裏，我們對某個地方即使有了愛情，無疑的，一個巨大無比的力控制了我們，我們不應該有一些兒女的留戀！</p>
<p>戰爭第五年代的春三月，是我們的開始，也是我們的結束。</p>
<p>——樣，你應該瞭然於我此刻對那小城纏綿的情懷了。</p>
<p>都會的一角，從對窗紅色的洋樓又傳來那喚起我懷辦的調子。</p>
<p>我應該寫下一些什麼了；很慘的，那位少女的生命是終結在一次難產裏，再後來那小城不斷接受了人爲的戰亂和災害。</p>
<p>向同一代的年靑孩子傾訴我的情愫，我們還得向時代控訴！</p>
<p>今天，我寫着，一行又一行，美麗的靈魂，請聽我的聲音。</p>
<p>「瘦損了？爲誰？」「爲我們這一代人的命運！」你說，我歡喜的。</p>
<p>可是，這不過是一個夢。</p>
<p>（三五，七，十五，上海）。</p>

<h3>讀書</h3>
<p>— 少夫</p>
<p>出版界的不景氣，經濟方面的影響倒在其次，最嚴重的危機是民智的低落。說給人家聽好像是笑話，一本暢銷的書祇有二三千本，而雜志最多也不過在一萬册左右。爲什麽有這樣的現象呢？有人說這是讀者購買力的薄弱，這話祗可聊備一格，事實上我是絕對不相信的。</p>
<p>不必再舉別的例子。星東隊在滬，每塲門票收入若干，最高的票價賣到萬元。馬連良梅蘭芳的戲票價多少。也許有人會說，這是名球嚴的表演，名伶的演出，不足爲例的。那麽，每天舞塲，酒樓，電影院的收入呢？購買力薄弱這一說法，頗難成立。老實說，今日的上海人，寗肯花一萬塊錢買一條玻璃褲帶，或者七萬五千元買一隻玻璃烟盒，却不肯花六百元買一本「見聞」或「新聞天地」，八千元買一本「約翰克里司朶夫」的。這不是購買力不購買力的問題，而是不願續書無心讀書的問題。</p>
<p>且不用功利觀點來說什麽讀書有益，書中自有黄金屋，即以消遣娛樂來說，讀書也是最經濟最方便的方法。任何時問，任何地點，任何形式都可以攫取書中的樂趣，而且花幾千塊錢就有幾本書在，不像跳舞，鬆了手停了脚，什麽都沒有了，也不像看電影，走出大門，什麽也沒有了，所以，讀書是最經濟最方便也是最實惠的一種娛樂。</p>
<p>我們顧意發起一種讀書運動，我們希望大家每天能抽出一點鐘半點鐘的時間來讀幾頁書，甚至看兩本雜誌也是好的。不過有許多誨淫海盜造謠生事之類的東西，並不在我們所應讀的範圍。</p>
<h3>美國影片在上海　袖珍影片將來華</h3>
<p>— 蔭槐</p>
<p>「到目前爲止，好萊塢電影在中國，它的對象還僅限於幾個大城市中的比較少數的智識份子這是不够的。」一個美國影片公司的駐滬負責人最近如此對記者說：「影片是最好的敎育工具，它將知識形象化。此次大戰，它曾帮助美國政府訓絲出一個龐大的軍隊，减短了時間，擴大了效果。它的娛樂價值也極大，在一天勞作以後，影片會帶來莫大的愉快。因此它不當屬於少數幾個高貴的都市人們，它應該深入民間，讓千千萬萬鄕村間的勞苦大衆共同享受。—好萊塢幾家最前進的製片公司都已如此決定。」</p>
<p>中國的農民，總數佔總人口百分之八十以上，他們大多數陷在無知的暗影裏，沒有娛樂，只有勞作。今日的好萊塢能注意到中國如此廣大而無人關懷的平民羣，該說是相當溫暖的一點同情</p>
<p>他們的辦法是把大戰期中新發明的十六米厘袖珍電影介紹到中國來。好萊塢電影通常是卅五米厘的大型尺寸，因爲放映設備較笨重，流動性校差，因此不易音遍。十六米厘佔地較少，放映機器輕便，它可以深入到最荒僻的鄉村去。祗要有一間屋子，聚幾個人，便立即可以放映。同時，因爲需用電力較小，它自備有小型發電機應用，不必担心農村裏沒有電廠。</p>
<p>國語對白</p>
<p>怕農民不懂英語嗎？好萊塢的製片家早考慮到這一點，他們準備全部給配上國語的說明與對白，加上中文的片頭。這，在最近幾張新聞片中大致已經透露了些端倪。</p>
<p>十六米厘影片中將有許多是敎育文化短片，這種影片對敎育我們的農民，諒來可收頗火的效果的。但其中多數將是通常卅五糎片的縮影。農民將以較低廉的代價享受這第八藝術。</p>
<p>好萊塢影片商在上海約十餘家。其中較大的八家：雷電華，米高梅，聯美，環球，哥倫比亞，二十世紀，華納與派拉蒙，組織了一個電影協會，幹着些折衝與議價等等有集體利害關係的工作。開展與推進十六糎電影便是他們的議題之一。雖然其中像米高梅與雷電華據說早已運到了一些這類的影片，然而實際的推行却至少還有二重困難。</p>
<p>也有困難</p>
<p>第一，因爲美國本國對放映十六糎片的機器亦極端的需要，目前還無法大量輸出。第二，上海海關方面進口的困難。江海關遠在本年三月間，便有了個新的決策，由於外匯的缺乏，規定美國影片商每季祗准運進六萬公尺的新片，並不論部計算。如此，美國影片商的紐約總公司便大傷腦筋了。究竟輸人供都市中放映而買座極有把握的卅五糎片呢？還是輸入只能供農村中放映的十六糎片呢？（因爲美國方面規定，十六糎片只許在沒有卅五糎電影院設備的所在放映。）商人的腦筋，常然不會忘懷收入的外匯。他們究竟不會爲了一個好聽的「空名」而運來悅目的影片。</p>
<p>他們終極的目標仍然在於外　。</p>
<p>收入不差</p>
<p>試閱他們收獲的數字。像「一千〇一夜」，據說已上映了六十餘天每天三塲的售票收入是一千餘萬元，除去娛榮捐及營業稅，淨利約六百餘萬元。影片商與戲院的分拆比例在百分之四十至五十間，即是，片商可獲三百萬元法幣。六十餘天的凈收入就快近一億八千萬元。雖說折成美匯，只九萬元不足的戔戔之數·但是合起來却也成了一個可觀的數字。</p>
<p>金錢，這是全世界任何一個商人囑目的獵物，美國影片商也並未例外。十六糎影片的另一種看法正可以此作註解。那便是：廣大的農村是一片尚未開墾的處女地，可能成爲他們的遼闊無垠的獵塲。海關的限制，也正可以此說朋，是想節制止一些漏出的外匯。而電影的敎育價值又是一個不能否認的事實。因此誰是誰非，是頗非容易決定的。</p>
<p>從六月廿九以後，美國遝華影片便實際上受了此項限制條例的管束。在滬美片商（主要的便是電影協會）業已經由美領事館在交涉中，紐約總公司也已經由外交方面向我政府商討一折衷辦法。他們提議，該項限制以新片的部數爲單位，俾尺數及拷貝可以隨需要而伸縮。據他們估計，每家公司每季輪入卅六部新片，每部新片三部拷貝，大約便可適應中國電影市塲的需要。</p>
<p>後文究竟如何，惟有留待下回分解了。</p>
<h3>中國饑餓　上海打醮</h3>
<p>— 新方</p>
<p>廢歷的七月又來了，上海的各里弄又在發起打太平公醮了；對於打太平公醮這種事，我覺得當局實在有絕對禁止的必要·中國各地，甚至是世界各地，可以說都在閙着饑荒；上海現在霍亂流行，時疫猖獗；有許多人受着經濟的關係，不能獲得合理的醫治而損失了他們的生命。我們難道把這些事視若無睹囑，難道鬼神會保護我們免染時疫嗎？在今日原子時代，我不希望再有一個中國人相信這種蠢舉，我要大聲呼喊廢除打醮！</p>
<p>中國人向有一種崇拜迷信不聞不問的脾氣；打醮習俗的不能打破大半亦是爲了這種　故；可是抗戰勝利後的新中國是絕對再不容許打醮道種事了！我們經過了八年艱苦的戰爭後，國家社會經濟已瀕破產，民衆精神或物質上的損失亦已不可計，無聊滑稽的打醮，誰可以說不應該廢除呢？</p>
<h3>市府樂園今晚節目</h3>
<p>市府響樂團，今晚（八月三日）在逸園舉行演奏會。節目有恰依可夫斯基之「花的圓舞曲」，普茜尼之「蝴蝶夫人」等名曲。此次特聘名女高音茅愛立女士獨唱，茅女士係海上名師蘇石林敎授之高足。今晚茅女士與管絃樂隊合作演奏「唐璜」中的詠歎調「托斯卡」中的羅曼曲等名歌</p>
<p>今晚節目如下：羅西尼之「咸廉泰爾」序曲，恰依可夫斯基的「花的圓舞曲」選自「胡挑夾」舞曲及其「如歌的並步板」選自其第五交響樂，第利必斯舞踴樂「克丕利亞」茅愛立女士獨唱，莫札特「唐璜」，瑪斯卡尼「田間騎士」，普茜尼「托斯卡」中選曲及歌劇「蝴蝶夫人」之選曲，與「西格，朱薩發」組曲中之進行曲等。</p>
<h3>大勢所趨</h3>
<p>— 羅汀</p>
<p>上海學校的收費，花樣翻新，愈來愈奇。我們校中（滬東某大學）自下學期起宿費分成各種等級，最高價目爲二萬四千元，房間兩面有窗，空氣新鮮，最低爲一萬八千元，面北房間，冬天吃西北風，夏天晒驕陽，面南房間二萬元。這樣可以權利與義務相等，好的房間高的價目，壞的房間低的價目。</p>
<p>遺倒是很新奇的，很適合於上海的風氣的。</p>
<p>一切商品化，大勢所趨，沒有辦法！</p>
<h3>未結婚先蜜月　在蘇聯沒關係</h3>
<p>— 張天佑</p>
<p>當我讀完了吳劍華先生的大作「牢騷」一文，不禁有所感想，所以也來說幾句。</p>
<p>吳先生爲了二個未滿二十歲的男女學生沒有給婚而度蜜月，還在法庭上自稱「自由」，便感慨無窮的說：「那麽的懂得『自由』？可嘆！」並且還以爲婚姻仍有必要，否則怎樣維持社會組織？</p>
<p>的確，娟姻制度仍有必要。然而世界上却已確乎有未結婚先度蜜月的國家。不信，那就是蘇聯的婚姻制度。現在我抄一些『萍踪寄語』三集裏的話：</p>
<p>「關於兩性間的關係，在蘇聯認爲這是屬於個人的事情，所以並不加以瑣曆的干涉，但對兒童的幸福和保障方面，却加以鄭重的注意。這個要點可說是蘇聯婚姻律的主幹。</p>
<p>「此外還有一個要點，便是在婚姻律上，男女處於完全平等的地位。</p>
<p>「在蘇聯結婚用不着任何儀式，不過爲保護結婚者雙方的以及他們子女的幸福健康起見，倘要在民事註册局登記，須遵守左列條件：</p>
<p>一·男女兩方須達到十八歲的年齡。</p>
<p>二·男女兩方的健康情形須將實情彼此相告。</p>
<p>三·婚事登記須得雙方同意。（四·五·從略）</p>
<p>「依蘇聯的法律，男女同居即事實上的結婚。不登記也有同樣效力。所不同者，是登記過的倘有離婚事情發生，發生瞻養子女等問題，而須由國家出爲主持時，證據已有。未經登記的須先由法庭鑒定確已有結婚的證據，然後才能持證赴民事註册局辦離婚登記。</p>
<p>「婚姻登記不登記，聽本人的便，這是因爲承認兩性間的關係是屬於個人的事情。不登記的婚姻和登記的婚姻負有同樣的責任。遺是要保障子女和任何一方的利益——尤其是婦女方面。所以在蘇聯什麼「通姦」「軋姘頭」「私生子」等名詞，根本都不存在」。</p>
<p>由上列諸語，我們可以看到蘇聯的婚姻，假使這二位男女學生，換了蘇聯人，或者住在蘇聯的話，便不會被監護人控告了。</p>
<h3>連環漫畫　三毛從軍記（九六）</h3>
<p>— 張樂平作</p>
<h3>中國藥中美國（下）</h3>
<p>— 許桂庭</p>
<p>咳嗽的特效藥是蟬蛻。據說，蟬之爲物，生時終日長鳴，因此它的肺部必然非常强壯故也。</p>
<p>醫治乳蛾的藥劑是由一種昆蟲煆灰和食鹽與蘋果片混合而成。進服時須慢慢吞嚥，方具特效。</p>
<p>美國朋友報告如此</p>
<p>上面是美國朋友的報告，所擬藥方有些是芷確的，可是一部分却連到我們中國人也不大敢相信。總之，我們在國外的藥材店老　或者宜傳過甚，未免近乎離奇。</p>
<p>在太平洋戰事發生之前，那藥材舖還有「虎骨酒」出售，一杯值美金一元七角五分。現在假使能够買得到的話，大的每瓶美金十七元。</p>
<p>我們「貴國」的藥商時常用「唯我獨尊」的口吻對美國朋友宜傳說：我們的神藥是靠着效果而賣錢的，　於何以能夠療治的原因則無需加以研究。不料美國朋友的頭腦是太科學化了。他們居然有一批人馬致力於研究中國的醫藥。</p>
<p>南加利福尼亞州立大學醫學敎授馬斯氏（Arthur　Maas）曾經研究麻黄的成分，並且發現這種藥草對於循環系統的確有調整增强的效能。麻黄的副產物對於內腎腺也能發生同樣的效用。</p>
<p>這位教授從前是懷疑着虎牙是否能够療治虛弱症的，不渦最近却發現了它含有異常豐富的磷酸　鈣。就是科學醫治療虛弱症的病人時也是同樣處方的。用蟹眼睛來醫治腹痛講起來是荒誕不經的，但馬斯敎授最近又發現了它含有氣化鈣。這是治療腸胃酸質過多的特效藥。</p>
<p>還有一種醫治肺結核的古方，其成分鱸傳如下：用一隻猪肚，裏面　滿了下面所列的藥材，一所神　朝北的一撮土，陽光未曾曬過的地方上生長的一束草，一隻活生生的小水　，一隻生蝦蟆，一些手指甲，頭髮數條，黃紙煆灰，和人生根泡成的茶。統統擺在一起，煎幾個鐘頭，經常進服，必有奇效。</p>
<p>從前曾經在重慶担任斯拉克斯醫院駐華分院院長的巴斯爾博士（Dr．G．C．Basil）根據研究的結果斷定這一條藥方確有治療的價值。他的解釋是：泥土是含着矽酸鹽和其他礦質，草裏面含有鉅量維他命，水　富於蛋白質，手甲含有鈣質，紙灰是炭質，有抑除胃腸汚穢的功效。人參是被用爲緩和劑的。猪肚的成分在近代醫學上是被承認爲專治貧血病的物質的。</p>
<p>中國藥物也很科學</p>
<p>巴斯爾博士並稱　皮確有活血的功能，其中含有重要的強壯劑的成分。</p>
<p>會經在中國第八路軍服務的弗萊博士（Dr．Richard　Frey）在紐的舉行的援華大會裏聲稱：「我們由於分析的結果及臨床的經驗發現許多中國的藥物是科學化的，雖然中國的大夫多數未能解釋其科學化治療的價值。」</p>
<p>紐約裏的中國藥材店老　對着奧本哈姆講得越來越起勁時，他說：「青微素是並不稀奇的。我們中國人數百年來就是用一種微菌來醫治白濁和花柳病的，此即所謂以毒攻毒者也。我們知道西洋的醫師，經覺得稀奇爲什麽我們會用海狗腎做藥材的。然而他們現在知到了，海狗腎是最當於雄他命的呀！我們中國人民數千年來沿用至今，總知道何者適宜，何者不合的。現在白稱人的醫生才開始告訴我們爲什麽中國藥物會這樣笨騐的呢。</p>
<p>在這裏，無數瘋狂於西洋醫藥的上海人對那些美國大夫的發現，究竟作何感想呢？（完）</p>

<h3>Marshal to Visit Lushan Again Today; Visited President Song Yesterday and Met with Yu Dawei; Focus of Discussions Shifts to the Anping Incident</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 2nd] Special Envoy Marshall will continue addressing issues concerning US troops in China today. At 10:00 AM, he met with three American military officers, departing at 10:40 AM. At 11:00 AM, Marshal Marshall traveled alone by car to visit President Song, holding a lengthy discussion and having lunch together. He didn't leave until 4:00 PM in the afternoon, and the content of their conversation is unknown. It is rumored that Marshal Marshall may fly to Guling with President Song tomorrow. Furthermore, at 6:00 PM this afternoon, Yu Dawei visited Marshall Marshall by appointment, leaving after a half-hour discussion. Marshal Marshall will depart for Guling tomorrow afternoon, and may invite Zhou Enlai for a meeting before leaving. However, there appears to be no progress in the negotiations between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. According to a certain source, the Communist Party is refusing to concede, making negotiations impossible. Therefore, in order to reopen the doors to negotiation, new ideas are needed. Judging from the current situation, Marshal Marshall's meetings with various individuals over the past two days have focused less on Kuomintang-Communist negotiations, and have largely shifted to the "Anping" incident.</p>
<p>[Our Guling Office, 2nd] It is heard that Special Envoy Marshall will come to Lushan with President Song tomorrow. Also, Ambassador Stuart suffered from a cold last night upon returning to the embassy from the Chairman's headquarters due to the cold weather and felt unwell. Therefore, he remained in bed resting at noon. When Cooke visited, his medical officer indicated that the ambassador did not plan to return to Nanjing for three days.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guling, 2nd] Ambassador Stuart continues on the 2nd to collect relevant information regarding the attack on the U.S. Marine Corps on the Pingjin Highway, hoping to quickly and thoroughly understand the truth. The ambassador is handling this matter with great effort to avoid being swayed by emotions and remains exceptionally calm. It is said that Marshal Marshall will come to Guling again from Nanjing within the next few days, which is related to the handling of this matter.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guling, 2nd] U.S. Fleet Commander-in-Chief in China, Admiral Cooke, visited Chairman Chiang at his headquarters at 10:00 AM on the 2nd, making his first official visit after arriving in Guling. He left after forty minutes. He then visited Ambassador Stuart at his residence, discussing the attack on the U.S. Marine Corps on the Pingjin Highway for about half an hour. At noon, under the guidance of Chief Secretary Huang Renlin, he toured the Immortal Cave with his wife and children. After the tour, they went to the Lichi Society swimming pool in Hedong Road for swimming. At 8:30 PM, he and his family attended a tea party held by Chairman Chiang and his wife at the headquarters. Mrs. Marshall, National Government Propaganda Advisor Bell, and Minister Peng of the Central Propaganda Department were also invited to attend. The gathering ended at 10:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Chairman Has Political Solution for Domestic Disputes; Minister Peng Speaks to Reporters in Guling</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guling, 2nd] Minister of Propaganda Peng Xuepei and Advisor Bell visited Chairman Chiang at his headquarters at 8:00 PM on the 2nd.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] Peng Xuepei gave a brief speech at a banquet for reporters in Guling on the 2nd, stating that a car takes a maximum of only ten minutes to get from place to place, and an electric tram takes only three minutes, showing that Chinese affairs often take a little longer due to a lack of necessary conditions. Internal disputes in China must be resolved, and resolved quickly. No one is more anxious to resolve domestic disputes than the government, and no one is more anxious than Chairman Chiang, but it always takes a little time. Chairman Chiang has already resolved the problem of Chinese warlords and the problem of Japanese aggression. He will certainly be able to resolve the domestic disputes. I know he has a solution, and I know it is a political solution. He is a doctor who knows the habits and history of the patient, and we should give him some time. Today, Advisor Bell, Tao Xisheng, Lu Qixin, Zeng Hanguang, and *Life* magazine reporter Seale were invited. The hosts of the banquet were special correspondents from the Central News Agency and eighteen newspapers from Nanjing, Shanghai, Wuhan, and Jiangxi.</p>
<h3>Military Mediation Department Group Departs Today to Investigate Attack on U.S. Troops; Gao Songyuan and Others' Inspection Concludes It Was a Premeditated Action</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Office, 2nd] (1) The 25th Group of the Military Mediation Department is scheduled to depart for Anping Town, Xianghe County, on the 3rd to investigate the attack on U.S. troops. The government representative is Lü Nengding, the Communist Party representative is Lei Renjiang, and the U.S. representative is Alexander. (2) Regarding the attack on U.S. troops in Anping Town, although the Communist army was responsible, the local authorities also bear responsibility. It is heard that the local authorities here will apologize to the U.S. military.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Office, 2nd] Gao Songyuan, Deputy Chief of Staff of the 11th War Area, and Huang Rencai, Commissioner of the Fifth District of Hebei Province, were ordered by Director Li Zongren to inspect the sites of the attack on U.S. troops on the Pingjin Highway at Daxiaosha River. They returned at 3:00 PM on the 2nd. According to them, the inspection concluded that the action was planned. The authorities will report the findings of the investigation to Chairman Chiang. Gao and others departed at 6:00 PM on the 1st, first going to Matou Town, west of Daxiaosha River. Because the National Army had not yet advanced to Daxiaosha River, they stayed overnight in Matou Town. They only advanced with the army on the morning of the 2nd, staying in Daxiaosha River for two hours. They learned from local residents that the Communist army knew that the U.S. troops were passing through and originally intended to ambush them in Anping. However, after the villagers of Anping knelt and begged, they changed the location to Daxiaosha River, because the terrain there was suitable for ambush. They also detained two ox carts that were passing along the road and placed them across the road as obstacles. When the U.S. troops arrived, they suddenly opened fire, and the U.S. troops were caught off guard, resulting in casualties. Based on this account, it can be seen that the Communist army's actions were premeditated. According to eyewitness accounts from villagers, the Communist army suffered heavy casualties in the battle. In addition to more than 60 wounded and dead officers and soldiers being transported back to Xianghe City in large carts, dozens of people were buried locally. The command of the 11th War Area will issue a statement based on the findings of the investigation.</p>
<h3>U.S. Soldiers Killed in Attack Buried in Tianjin Yesterday; Mayor Zhang and Others Pay Condolences</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Beiping, 2nd] The U.S. Marine Corps authorities announced that another U.S. Marine Corps member who was attacked on Monday died this morning, bringing the total number of deaths to four. At the same time, it is confirmed that the National Government has decided to make two demands to the Communist representative of the Military Mediation Department in Beiping regarding the attack on U.S. troops: (1) All personnel who carried out the ambush on the U.S. Marine Corps must be handed over to the government for trial. (2) Compensation must be paid immediately to the families of the Marine Corps members who died. Reports indicate that the U.S. authorities have protested to the Communist Party regarding the attack.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 2nd] Three U.S. Marine Corps officers and soldiers who died in the attack by the Communist army near Anping on the Pingjin Highway were buried in the American Cemetery in Dongjuzi, Tianjin, on the 2nd. When the U.S. military held a memorial service, Tianjin Mayor Zhang Ting'e and the 94th Army Commander Mou Tingfang and others all went to pay their condolences.</p>
<h3>Communist Party to Continue Anti-American Movement in North China; *Liberation Daily* Publishes Absurd Theories Again</h3>
<p>[United Press, Beiping, 2nd] The United States received a warning today that anti-American movements are expected to continue in North China, similar to the ambush of U.S. troops on July 29th and the kidnapping of seven U.S. soldiers half a month ago. The Communist Party has already acknowledged both incidents, but regarding the former incident, the Communist Party accused the U.S. military of attacking the "Eighth Route Army" alongside the National Army. At the same time, the U.S. military is still unwilling to officially confirm that the attackers of the U.S. military were Communist troops. It is also learned that Yan'an ordered the Communist army in North China to engage in conflict with the U.S. military and mobilized the people in the areas where U.S. troops were stationed to launch an anti-American movement, with the intention of creating accidents to force the U.S. military to withdraw from China.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Beiping, 2nd] According to a dispatch from Yan'an, the Communist Party's official newspaper, *Liberation Daily*, published a commentary today on the attack on the U.S. Marine Corps, demanding that the U.S. military withdraw from China, considering this to be the "foundation" for resolving the current situation's disputes. The newspaper also stated: "We should also demand that the U.S. Marine Corps in Tianjin apologize, punish the responsible officers, and publicly guarantee that they will not attack or disturb the 'Liberated Areas.'"</p>
<h3>Communist Party Spokesman Claims the Current Situation Is Serious</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 2nd] Since the incident of the Communist army attacking U.S. troops in Anping, North China, all parties have been paying close attention. According to the Communist Party delegation, the Communist Party has obtained reports that (1) it has been confirmed that it was a U.S. armed patrol; (2) Anping belongs to the Liberated Area; (3) a "conflict" did occur between the two sides. Zhou Enlai has already instructed Ye Jianying by telegram to send a special team to investigate in order to determine responsibility. According to an observer, the incident may have been deliberately created, but it was done too clumsily, causing the current situation to become serious.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Nanjing, 2nd] Communist Party spokesman Wang Bingnan stated last night after Zhou Enlai and Marshall held a three-hour "extensive exchange of views": "The current moment is extremely important." He continued: Although the Marshall-Zhou meeting was of a general nature, it did not "specifically" consider the Anping incident involving the U.S. military. We have not yet received a report of the conflict, but we feel that this is an unpleasant incident. We have now suggested sending a special team to investigate. Regarding the question of whether Marshall brought back any concrete suggestions from Guling, Wang Bingnan replied: "There is no definite agreement yet. We are now waiting for Ambassador Stuart. It is too early to comment on whether Stuart will bring a compromise suggestion to stop the conflict and break the political negotiation deadlock." Wang Bingnan did not elaborate on the phrase "important moment," but said: "If all the problems can be resolved, China can achieve peace. If they cannot be resolved, the civil war will become more widespread and serious."</p>
<h3>Beiping Headquarters Spokesman Refutes Yan'an Broadcast</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 2nd] The spokesman for the Beiping Headquarters solemnly denied on the 2nd the news broadcast by Yan'an that 80 National Army soldiers attacked the Communist army on the morning of July 29th together with 60 U.S. Marine Corps soldiers. The spokesman stated that the broadcast was purely baseless slander and the most despicable and malicious propaganda.</p>
<h3>Ninth Group Returns to Hankou; Flew to Shaanxi Yesterday on Original Plane</h3>
<p>[Our Hankou Office, 2nd] The government representative of the Ninth Group, Major General Lu Jishi, the U.S. representative, Colonel He Zhujian, the Communist representative, Major General Xue Zizheng, and over ten other personnel, including translators and telegraphers, returned to Hankou from Laohekou on a U.S. special plane at 2:00 PM yesterday. They are scheduled to fly to Xi'an on the original plane this afternoon.</p>
<h3>Minister Bai Flew to Henan Yesterday to Inspect Garrison Troops</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 2nd] Minister of National Defense Bai Chongxi flew to Xinxiang, Henan, this morning at 10:00 AM on a special plane to inspect the troops, accompanied by six or seven staff members.</p>
<h3>Pan Guangdan and Others Arrive in Nanjing; Gu Zhutong and Kunming Mayor Visit Families of Li and Wen to Express Condolences</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 2nd] Professors Pan Guangdan and Fei Xiaotong, who had sought refuge in the U.S. Consulate in Kunming after the assassination of Li and Wen in Kunming, arrived in Nanjing from Chongqing on the 2nd. They were accompanied by Counselor Liu Yingshi, who was sent by the Ministry of Education to Kunming to express condolences to the families of Wen Yiduo. Reporters interviewed Pan and Fei. Pan stated: "We are professors with an inclination toward education, so we are very reluctant to enter the political vortex. We do not wish to make any comments on the assassination of Li and Wen, only stating: We are willing to wait for the government to handle it." They will only stay in Nanjing for a few days before flying north to teach at Tsinghua University.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Kunming, 2nd] Commander-in-Chief Gu Zhutong ordered Kunming Mayor Zeng Shuhuai on the 2nd to express condolences to the families of Li Gongpu and Wen Yiduo and to inquire in detail about the circumstances of the assassination.</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Establishes Consulate in Changchun; Commercial Agencies Established in Shenyang and Harbin</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Office, 2nd] Official news: The Soviet Union has established a consulate general in Changchun and commercial agencies in Shenyang and Harbin with our consent. The first Consul General in Changchun is Marfutov, who will lead his staff to Changchun within the next few days. The representative in Shenyang is Yu Fugeng, and the representative in Harbin has not yet been determined.</p>
<h3>Current Status of Major Railways Across the Country</h3>

<h3>National Army in Northern Jiangsu Approaches Haian; Communist Army from Shandong Reinforces Southward; Traffic on the Yangtian Highway to Be Restored Soon</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 2nd] Military News: On the front lines of northern Jiangsu, the war is dormant, but the Communist army is frequently dispatching troops, indicating that a large-scale military offensive will soon unfold in Yangzhou, Taizhou, Taixing, Rugao, and northeast of Suqian on the eastern section of the Longhai Railway. The Communist army is now transferring a large number of reinforcements from Shandong Province, crossing the Longhai Railway and arriving in Shuyang, preparing to attack Donghai to the north and Suqian to the south. Part of the reinforcements went directly to Huaiyin, landing near Qishui along the Grand Canal and heading towards Linze, advancing along the Linxing (Hua) Highway to Dongtai in an attempt to save the critical situation in Haian. A small number of Communist troops near the Yangtai Highway are attempting to make trouble, but the National Army is closely monitoring them. The traffic situation on the Tongru Highway is good. The National Army is repairing the Yangzhou-Yizheng Highway day and night. Communist troops near the Yangzhou-Tianchang Highway have been gradually cleared, and military trucks can now travel between Yangzhou and Tianchang. Overall, the situation in northern Jiangsu remains extremely chaotic. According to a military observer, the situation in northern Jiangsu is expected to be clarified within February, and the refugees in northern Jiangsu are already preparing to return to their hometowns.</p>
<p>[Our Jiangdu Office, 2nd] The National Army in Yangzhou launched an attack along the Yangtian Highway today, capturing strongholds such as Ganquan Mountain, Ganquanji, and Fangjiaxiang at 1:00 PM in the afternoon. At the same time, the National Army in Tianchang also launched attacks one after another and has now stationed troops in Huajiaji.

<h3>Senator Wheeler Criticizes the State Department; Why Does the U.S. Support the CCP? It Is Truly Incomprehensible to the Chinese People</h3>
<p>[Our New York Correspondent Mao Shuqing, 1st] Senator Wheeler of Nebraska issued a warning in the Senate today, stating: "The United States is lending huge sums to totalitarian countries such as Yugoslavia, while being unwilling to give to our ally China. The reasons for this are truly incomprehensible to the awakened Chinese people." Wheeler attacked the errors of American foreign policy, saying that the policy is sufficient to cause a third world war. He said: "The State Department's support for the Chinese Communist Party is directly beneficial to the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union has become a real threat to world peace and world security. We, under the leadership of American diplomats, are moving toward an atomic war." After pointing out the situation of the Soviet Union's invasion of Eastern Europe, Wheeler declared that the Yalta Agreement signed by Stalin and Roosevelt sold out the Chinese people to the Communist Party and sold out America's major interests in the Far East at the same time. Wheeler demanded that the Senate thoroughly investigate the Chinese issue, saying that the Soviet Union, under the protection of secret agreements, openly plundered the property of the Northeast, and China was divided into two as a result. Wheeler criticized: "President Truman seems to believe that the Communist Party's participation in the Chinese government can make it a so-called 'democratic' government, but we regard the Communist Party as totalitarian. Why is that?" Wheeler then compared the U.S. government and the Chinese government: "Why does the U.S. government advocate the Communist Party's participation in the Chinese government, while the Congressional Committees and the Department of Justice are doing their best to prevent the Communist Party from participating in the U.S. government? Why does Truman believe that the Chinese Communist Party is democratic and an agricultural reformer, while we regard the American Communist Party as loyal to a foreign government? Why doesn't Truman insist that the Communist Party should open up its occupied areas in order to restore traffic and save millions of starving people? Why is the amount of aid from the United Nations to China limited, while the aid given by the United States to Soviet satellite countries and even former enemy countries is so generous?"</p>
<h3>Cai Wenzhi Issues Statement; Communist Party's Goal Is to Force the U.S. Military to Withdraw, Then Launch a Full-Scale Civil War in North China</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Office, 2nd] Cai Wenzhi, the government counselor to the Military Mediation Department, issued a statement today regarding the attack on U.S. troops near Anping Town on July 29th, believing that the Communist army's action was intended to force the U.S. military to withdraw, and after the U.S. military withdrew, to launch a full-scale civil war in the provinces of North China. The main points of the original statement are as follows: (1) The Communist Party has admitted that the attack was carried out by the Communist army. (2) The Communist Party's statement that the U.S. military entered the Liberated Area and that the National Army accompanied them is purely a fabrication and a denial. The area is the Pingjin Highway. The U.S. military transports supplies every three days, and vehicles come and go. It is not the so-called Liberated Area. (3) The U.S. military regularly transports supplies from Tianjin to Beiping for the U.S. personnel of the Executive Headquarters and the Marine Corps stationed in Beiping. How can the National Army accompany them? The Communist army sneaked into the highway area, set up obstacles on the highway in advance, and arranged ambushes. This was premeditated. (4) The Communist Party said that the National Army was accompanying them that day. If so, the National Army should have been prepared. Why was the attack so sudden, with so many U.S. military casualties and no National Army casualties? What the Communist Party said is obviously a false accusation after killing someone. (5) Ten days after the U.S. military was kidnapped in Beidaihe, there was another attack on U.S. troops in Anping Town. This was obviously premeditated by the highest authorities of the Communist Party. (6) The U.S. military's stationing in China to assist prisoners of war does not infringe upon our sovereignty.</p>

<h3>Chairman Chiang Cables Orders to Provincial and Municipal Governments: Must Complete Grain Collection on Schedule, This Decision Addresses National Economy and People's Livelihood</h3>
<p>[Hankou Local News, 2nd] Chairman Chiang, regarding the collection of grain in lieu of land tax, recently sent a cable from Mount Lu ordering all provincial and municipal governments to begin collection as scheduled and complete it within the allotted time. The cable outlined the government's decision, stating first: "The acceptance of surrender and reconstruction work have been repeatedly disrupted, and the major military reorganization cannot be delayed. The current difficulties are increasingly severe, and the number of refugees is growing. The central government, considering the current situation, believes that during the reconstruction period, before the economy has returned to normal, it is still appropriate to collect physical grain in lieu of land tax. In order to improve local finances urgently, the financial revenue and expenditure system has already transferred most of the land tax revenue to the provincial and county levels in order to find solutions other than drastic measures to reduce the suffering of the people. This is truly an unavoidable measure addressing the current national economy and people's livelihood." The cable concludes by urging authorities in all provinces and municipalities to sincerely explain the situation to provincial and municipal councils and various local leaders, striving to cooperate and promote the completion of the task according to the plan.</p>
<h3>Tokyo Japanese Police Shoot Taiwanese Compatriots, Detailed Account of the Tragedy, Commander of the Occupation Forces in Japan Sends Personnel to Investigate, Li Bojun and Liao Jiwei Return Home to Release Report</h3>
<p>[Local News] On July 19th, in front of the Shibuya Police Station in Tokyo, a tragedy occurred in which Japanese police shot and killed five Taiwanese residents and seriously injured eighteen. Li Bojun and Liao Jiwei of the Foreign Affairs Section of our Occupation Forces Headquarters in Japan were ordered to investigate and have clarified the causes and consequences of the incident. Li Bojun returned to Shanghai yesterday and, according to his released investigation report, the main points are as follows:</p>
<p>Previously, at 3 PM on July 14th, a Taiwanese resident, Zhang Yuxun, was walking along Shinbashi Street when he was suddenly attacked by Japanese thugs who stabbed him in the jaw with a short knife. He went to the Matsuda gang to demand the surrender of the perpetrators, but the gang refused. He then went to the Atago Police Station on the 15th to file the same complaint, but the police station also refused to accept it. Zhang returned home in anger. Around noon on July 16th, a group of about hundreds of Japanese thugs gathered in Shinbashi and attacked more than one hundred Taiwanese residents in open-air shops. When the Taiwanese residents saw the unfavorable situation, they rushed to the Tokyo Overseas Chinese Association to ask the chairman to come and mediate. Chairman Ba Ligui, upon hearing the news, immediately went to Shinbashi to mediate on the spot. After Chairman Chen left, at about 3 PM, another group of about ten Japanese thugs, armed with Japanese swords, wooden sticks, and knives, rushed to the Taiwanese vendors to cause trouble. For self-defense, the Taiwanese residents disarmed the Japanese and resisted, resulting in injuries on both sides.</p>
<p>On July 17th, those involved in the case asked Chairman Chen to mediate and reported it to Lin Dingping, director of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Office. Director Lin then filed a protest with the Metropolitan Police Department, demanding compensation for damages, apologies for the desecration of the national flag, and guarantees that similar incidents would not occur in the future. The Metropolitan Police Department agreed to respond in three days. The Overseas Chinese Association knew that the Matsuda gang was intentionally instigating trouble because of the insult to the national flag, and the public was outraged. Therefore, they gathered at the Overseas Chinese Association at 4 PM on July 19th, intending to request the Overseas Chinese Affairs Office to find a peaceful and appropriate solution. Therefore, the gathering on that day was not a meeting to plan resistance. Moreover, the Overseas Chinese Affairs Office feared that the Taiwanese residents were too agitated. In order to calm their angry emotions, Director Lin, at the request of Chairman Chen, went to the Association to advise the Taiwanese residents to disperse and return home, saying that they had suffered mental anguish due to the Shinbashi incident on the 16th. Some of the overseas Chinese dispersed upon hearing this, but a small portion still felt it was not enough and gathered together to petition the delegation. Major General Li Libo happened to be going out and, upon seeing the situation, gave the same advice as Director Lin to comfort the Taiwanese residents, and also knew that the police had a responsibility to maintain law and order. Furthermore, knowing that the Taiwanese residents had no intention of causing trouble, he publicly declared that the journey home would be safe and that no accidents would occur, and sent a jeep to escort them at the request of the Taiwanese residents, because the Taiwanese residents knew that the Japanese police and the Matsuda gang were colluding and were always wary. They did not expect the Japanese police to dare to stage a tragedy of shooting and killing Taiwanese residents. The Japanese authorities cannot shirk their responsibility for this.</p>
<p>After the overseas Chinese dispersed from the delegation, they took several trucks to return. About ten minutes after each car departed from the delegation, escorted by a jeep of the delegation, a Japanese policeman suddenly appeared in front of the Shibuya Police Station, and another three to four hundred Japanese people gathered in front of the police station. While the overseas Chinese were puzzled, a number of armed policemen arrived, including more than ten police officers, blocking the road and blowing whistles and firing warning shots, ordering the cars to stop. The Japanese police lined up on the roadside stopped the jeep, and at the same time, sounds of "Kill!" "Kill!" and "Fire!" "Fire!" were heard. Xie Wenhua, who was sitting in the jeep, shouted in Japanese, "Stop!" "Stop!" and said, "Why stop the car? Why point guns at us?" The Japanese police ignored him and insisted that they get out of the car. Another policeman held the car with one hand and made a gesture of pulling out a weapon, saying, "Japan still has extraterritorial rights over the United Nations." While they were threatening them, Police Chief Tsuchida of the Shibuya Police Station rushed over and was told by Zhou Xiangni, an overseas Chinese, that "These are overseas Chinese who are dispersing and returning home. They are being escorted by a jeep." The police chief then agreed to let them pass.</p>
<p>As soon as the wheels started to turn, sudden and intense gunshots rang out, like firecrackers. The majority of Taiwanese residents in the following vehicles, unarmed and defenseless, were hit and injured. When each vehicle successively returned to the delegation, one person was killed on the spot, and twelve injured were taken to St. Luke's Hospital by ambulance for treatment. The rest were sent to the Tonin Society and Hiroo Hospital for treatment.</p>
<p>From the occurrence of the incident on the 19th to the 26th, five people died due to serious injuries, and eighteen were slightly or seriously injured. The bullet marks on the jeep and trucks are evidenced by photos of the trucks. Furthermore, it was found that the fourth truck was ordered to stop by the Japanese police, and the driver, Fanjiang Li, was shot and killed on the spot. Because no one was driving the car, all twenty-eight people were arrested and are still being held in the police station. This is the account of the Japanese police shooting and killing Taiwanese residents in front of the Shibuya Police Station that night.</p>

<h3>Former Puppet Wuxi County Magistrate Takes Refuge in Taihu Lake, Reaches Tacit Agreement with Communist Troops, Jiangsu Provincial Security Department Strictly Orders Five Counties to Jointly Encircle and Suppress</h3>
<p>[Suzhou Local News, 2nd] Yang Yanbin, the former puppet Wuxi county magistrate, became a bandit in Taihu Lake after the victory, and once called himself the Commander-in-Chief. According to reliable information, Wu Zhilong, the former enemy Wuxi Gendarmerie Captain, also led more than 500 of his remaining troops to join forces with Yang, calling for outlaws, totaling about 3,000 people. They have reached a tacit agreement with the foreign regiment of the Communist army and have established a stronghold on Pingtai Mountain in the lake, using the false banner of the "Jiangnan Democratic Allied Army," styling himself as commander and obtaining some American-style firearms. Their influence is growing daily. The Jiangsu Provincial Security Command has strictly ordered the five counties of Su, Xi, Wu, Zheng, and Wu to jointly encircle and suppress them starting in early August.</p>
<h3>Efforts for Peace Have Not Yet Succeeded, Communist Party Should Take Full Responsibility, Secretary-General Wu Gives Speech at the Capital Journalists Association</h3>
<p>[Nanjing Central News Agency, 2nd] Secretary-General Wu Tiecheng was the first official to address the inaugural meeting of the Capital Journalists Association on the 1st. Mr. Wu analyzed the current situation in a somber tone, pointing out that the government does not evade responsibility for the unsuccessful completion of post-victory reconstruction work and the obstacles to national construction, which have caused the people to continue to suffer disasters and sacrifices, and will take responsibility to relieve the suffering of the people nationwide. Mr. Wu continued: Today's situation is neither war nor peace, neither unity nor disunity, neither solidarity nor lack thereof. The tangible and intangible losses suffered by the people are incalculable. Transportation has not been restored, production is stifled, and the Communist troops have not yet accepted government orders. The local governments established by the CCP in various regions have not implemented government laws and regulations, so military orders cannot be unified until now. The reason for this is that the government's various efforts in Chongqing this year have completely failed. The government convened the Political Consultative Conference, invited all parties and factions to participate in the government, convened the National Assembly, implemented the unified reorganization of the military, restored transportation, and stopped military conflicts, all of which have failed. Although we are reluctant to say it explicitly, we must point out that the Chinese Communist Party is constantly raising issues and creating disputes, thereby destroying the PCC resolutions and should bear full responsibility for undermining peace.</p>
<p>If the efforts made by both the Kuomintang and the Communist Party at the beginning of this year and the various plans drafted with the assistance of Special Envoy Marshall could have been implemented, then China's true peace, lasting peace, true unity, and lasting unity would have been achieved long ago. At that time, there would have been no need to fear that the government would use military force to eliminate the CCP, and there would have been no need to fear that the CCP would threaten the government with force. Now the whole country longs for peace, the Kuomintang longs for peace, and the Communist Party also wants peace, but peace cannot be achieved in the end, and the reason lies in this.</p>
<p>Taking the conflict in northern Jiangsu as an example, northern Jiangsu is occupied by its production [illegible], [illegible] safety, [illegible] the government's entire [illegible], the government asks it to be stationed elsewhere, not only is it unwilling to accept, but also makes a large-scale offensive, the national army is self [illegible], and has to resist, [illegible] no country, no government [illegible] allows the Communist Party to have a martial [illegible] force to threaten its [illegible] security, all domestic [illegible] causes, from this can be a explanation. Wu said in the end that although the current situation is like this, the government still has the determination to put the country first and solve all difficulties with all peaceful means.</p>

<p>[Beiping Local News, 2nd] The Beiping Headquarters today tried Shao Wenkai, the former Ping Constitution Military Commander before the July 7th Incident, who served as the governor of Qiaoyu Province after the fall of the city. This is the first trial of a military traitor in North China. The trial took place in Huiren Hall in Zhongnanhai.

Huang Jingxiu of the Military Law Office and four assessors and one clerk were arranged on the left and right. Shao was brought into the hall through the east gate, wearing a gray silk gown, a black tuxedo, canvas shoes, and a trimmed haircut. He did not appear haggard, but initially showed a slight look of panic in court. The trial then began. Because the matter was confidential, details cannot be disclosed. Today's interrogation first confirmed Shao's status as a traitor, and then a date will be set to try him based on the materials of the Henan people's accusations against Shao.

<h3>Local Correspondences, General Relief Administration Allocates Assistance for Equipment, To Revive Zhejiang Marine Fisheries</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Hangzhou Quick Report] The counties belonging to Yong, Tai, and Wen along the coast of Zhejiang Province are concentrated areas for fisheries, known as one of the three major fishing grounds in the country. The annual fish production reaches 60 million loads, which, based on the current value of 10,000 yuan per load, is worth a total of 100 billion yuan. It is indeed one of Zhejiang's important production industries, which is of great importance to people's livelihood. In recent years, due to rampant piracy during the resistance period, fish production has sharply declined, with only about 20 million loads per year. In order to implement the revival of fisheries, the provincial authorities established a Fisheries Bureau, appointing Rao Yongbi as the director, which is scheduled to be established in mid-August. This time, the province requested the General Relief Administration to assist with 14 fishing vessels, 2,000 wooden fishing boats with a load of 50 tons, so that they can set up their own factories for assembly, as well as various new-style equipment such as cold war machines, dry-making machines, and canning factories. After the General Relief Administration sent fisheries expert Li Xiangyuan to Ningbo to inspect the results, it was decided that it was necessary to set up a large-scale shipyard. The location is planned to be Dinghai or Ningbo. Now, Naspi, a fisheries expert from the Sino-American Agricultural Technology Group, has come to Hangzhou from Shanghai to meet with Shen and discuss the improvement of coastal fisheries production in Zhejiang Province. The Provincial Government recently sent [illegible] on a fast train to Shanghai on the afternoon of the 31st to jointly inspect the Zhoushan Islands and the coastal areas of the Wen region with American experts by special boat. The scheduled time is half a month, so that the findings of the inspection can be used to formulate a fisheries improvement plan to provide opinions for the government to adopt.</p>
<h3>American Aircraft Measures Climate, Drops Motor in He</h3>
<p>[Jiashan Local Correspondence] On July 17th, in Xitang Northwest Village, a village in this county, a passing American plane dropped parachutes, etc. Feng Xushan, a farmer from Shao, found a small motor and a coil of wire in Hongmu Pond. The local police substation picked it up and sent it to the general office. The front of the machine reads "Wireless Motor," with English instructions next to it. "This machine is issued by the U.S. Government Weather Bureau from a height of twelve miles. It is dropped down. First, the balloon (a broken balloon like a larger light balloon sold in the market) bursts. Then, the machine descends slowly with the parachute (made of American crepe paper). When it descends, its function is like a radio broadcasting machine, and it is affected by the appropriate temperature and pressure in the air, sending out radio waves to report the climate. The machine is useless when it descends from the air to the ground." Inside there is a light bulb, an AB glass battery, wires and medicinal materials, and a spring steel skin under the seat. It is housed in a paper box. It is said that the machine was reported by the county government to the tenth district commissioner's office in Jiaxing and presented to the province. It is also reported that the same situation was found in Jin You County near Songjiang County, Jiangsu Province. Because people do not know the purpose of the object, there are many rumors.</p>
<p>Huzhou: Traitor's Accused Grandmother Drowns Herself</p>
<p>Zhang Chuanyu, a resident of No. 48, Court Street, Ximen, in this city, once served as a puppet village chief and hid in the city. He was recently reported by the villagers and imprisoned. His white-haired mother, who is already 20 years old, yearned for her grandson and often had short-sighted thoughts. On July 28th, taking advantage of the family's unpreparedness, she boarded the Hongli steamer alone, falsely claiming to go to Shanghai. When she reached the Luxu area, the old woman jumped into the river. The ship stopped and tried to salvage her, but she had already died when she was brought back on board, and there was no way to save her. The ship's accountant moved the body ashore temporarily and sent someone to inform the deceased's family to collect it.</p>

They were transferred to the county government yesterday and transferred to the court for trial.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The CCP's Anti-American Actions</h3>
<p>A detachment of the U.S. Marine Corps patrol in China was ambushed by CCP troops near Anping on the Pingjin Highway while traveling from Tianjin to Beiping on the 29th of last month. Three or four American officers and soldiers were killed and thirteen to fifteen were injured. Since this incident occurred, all parties have considered it an "unfortunate incident." Special Envoy Marshall, who was in Kuling meeting with President Chiang, flew back to Nanjing in haste after hearing the news for rapid handling. As of this writing, Marshall has received a detailed report and has roughly informed CCP representative Zhou Enlai. Simultaneously, Ambassador Stuart was also discussing the matter with President Chiang in Kuling. In addition to expressing his concern, President Chiang ordered Li Zongren, Director of the Beiping Pacification Headquarters, to conduct a thorough investigation. The truth of this "unfortunate incident" will soon come to light.</p>
<p>The CCP initially prevaricated about the case, attempting to shirk responsibility, even falsely claiming that there were no communist troops in the area, likely intending to shift the blame onto others. However, as the situation became clearer and they knew they could no longer conceal it, their representative Zhou Enlai stated that he had not yet received a report, but if such a thing had occurred, the CCP would take responsibility. At the same time, he claimed that for the past three weeks, U.S. Marines had repeatedly provoked communist troops in eastern Hebei, so the matter should be judged based on the attitude of the U.S. Marine Corps authorities, and the CCP had no intention of instigating conflict. They even hastily defended themselves, saying "this is definitely not the CCP's policy towards the United States." Little do they know that this kind of "burying one's head in the sand" propaganda is truly a case of "trying to hide what is already obvious."</p>
<p>At a time when Sino-American relations are becoming increasingly close, such an "unfortunate incident" seems unexpected to the general public, especially to the American people thousands of miles away. In fact, by revealing the inside story and exposing the CCP's conspiracies and tricks earlier, it would be easy to see how the CCP's anti-American offensive progressed from propaganda to action, and how it expanded its propaganda through action. We can also clearly see the role this "unfortunate incident" plays.</p>
<p>Our newspaper's editorial has long pointed out that the CCP is using two weapons: one is "anti-American" propaganda, and the other is the slogan of "opposing the civil war." Since the "July 7th Declaration" issued from Yan'an openly opposed the United States, it has reached the stage of revealing its true intentions. Therefore, the CCP's "anti-Americanism," progressing from propaganda to action, is an action carried out under orders and in coordination with the international situation. Only those with shallow views and short-sightedness would regard it as an unexpected event. We predict that if the U.S. government and people overemphasize this action and mistakenly believe that the presence of U.S. troops in China will cause trouble, then the CCP's actions of this kind may emerge endlessly. A Reuters dispatch from Beiping on the 2nd stated that the United States today received a warning, anticipating that anti-American movements in North China will continue to occur. This is exactly the situation we foresaw.</p>
<p>The relationship between China and the United States has always been extremely friendly. During the last war, the sons and daughters of the two countries fought shoulder to shoulder for many years, and the two countries have become war-tested friends who share the same fate. They not only hope to share peace and prosperity but also to work together to promote the progress of human civilization. After the end of the last war, the U.S. government, based on the above-mentioned lofty ideals, decided on its China policy, hoping that China would become a peaceful, democratic, unified, and strong country, and fulfill its responsibility of maintaining world peace in the United Nations. President Truman's declaration on China in December of last year was a reaffirmation of this policy. From then until today, the United States has used this as its guideline in both words and deeds, never crossing the line. The temporary presence of U.S. troops in China can not only help our country disarm Japanese troops and send them back home to complete our country's demobilization work, but it also has a significant benefit to the restoration of domestic peace in our country. The motivation of this U.S. policy towards China is entirely innocent and flawless. The U.S. government and public both believe that peace is indivisible, and if China, as a major power in the Far East, is in turmoil, then the United States cannot enjoy its peace and prosperity alone. The United States assisting China to achieve democratic unity and strength, and to maintain peace in the Far East, is not only for China but also for the United States, and therefore for the world and humanity. Therefore, all Chinese people, as well as peace-loving people with "human nature," will never intentionally undermine the U.S. policy towards China. Yet, there are now a few scoundrels with ulterior motives who spare no effort to "oppose the United States," and may even incite ignorant people to re-enact the "Boxer Rebellion" in North China, which truly makes us lament that these people are so unprogressive!</p>
<p>So why do they do this? To answer this question, one only needs to recall why Wang Jingwei, Chen Gongbo, and other traitors shouted "Greater East Asia" and sang "anti-British and anti-American" songs back then to understand half the story! Back then, Britain and the United States only recognized the Nationalist government led by President Chiang as the sole legitimate government, so Wang, Chen, and their fellow traitors had to "oppose Britain and the United States." Now, the United States still only recognizes the Nationalist government as the sole legitimate government and gives all assistance to the Nationalist government, so those who have a "tacit understanding" with Wang, Chen, and their ilk naturally regard the United States as an enemy and incite anti-Americanism. Mao Zedong was the first to issue anti-American remarks, demanding that the United States immediately cease its aid to China and withdraw its U.S. troops from China, even slandering U.S. aid to China as nothing less than creating internal strife, plunging China into chaos and poverty. Following this, the CCP's echo chambers, under their direction, clamored together, attempting to confuse the American people and thereby demanding that their government cease aid to China and withdraw its troops stationed in China. However, apart from a small number of people in the United States who, due to limited information, mistakenly believe that the domestic situation in China is chaotic and the future is bleak, and demand that the government change its policy, the majority of informed people have a clear understanding of the internal situation of Chinese politics, support the government's established policy, and will never be shaken by it. In particular, President Truman and Secretary of State Byrnes have faith and determination in China's future and earnestly hope that China will become a peaceful, strong, and unified country with 120,000 points of enthusiasm. The CCP, seeing that its orchestrated anti-American propaganda has not been effective, has gone a step further and used actions to threaten the United States, first by kidnapping U.S. soldiers, and then by ambushing U.S. patrols, all in order to achieve the "effect" of "withdrawing U.S. troops" on the stage through this "wonderful performance." Why do they want U.S. troops to withdraw from China at this time? To put it bluntly, it is because they want to be able to "create complete internal strife" and start a major fight without U.S. troops nearby. Therefore, the CCP's attack on U.S. troops this time was a planned action, and Zhou Enlai's statement that "this is definitely not the CCP's policy towards the United States" is akin to the humorous saying "there is no 300 taels of silver buried here, and the neighbor Ah Er did not steal it."</p>
<p>What attitude should the National Government adopt towards such anti-foreign cases, which are similar to the "Boxer Rebellion" on a large scale and similar to the "Lincheng train robbery" on a small scale? We believe it is very simple: the CCP fighting against the National Army can still be excused as "civil war," which may be tolerated. But now they harbor anti-foreign sentiments and act like bandits. There is no alternative but to resolutely suppress them, without compromise. Otherwise, "hesitation leads to chaos," beware, be careful!</p>

<h3>Conference Chairman Rotates Among Four Powers, Small Countries Firmly Oppose, No Result in Discussion of Voting Rights</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Paris, 2nd (Broadcast): The Conference Rules Committee met today to discuss three issues, which caused fierce debate, but no results were achieved and were postponed until tomorrow for further discussion. The three issues discussed are as follows: (1) Led by New Zealand, the small countries opposed the four major powers taking turns as chair of the conference. Molotov and Byrnes both believed that the small countries had no reason to object. No vote was taken and will be discussed again tomorrow. (2) The issue of majority and two-thirds voting was also discussed, but no results were achieved. (3) Poland requested a seat on the Committee on Treaties with Hungary, supported by Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, but opposed by Britain and the United States.</p>
<h3>Poland Requests to Participate in Discussion of Hungarian Treaty, Withdraws Automatically Due to Opposition from U.S. Representative</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] London, 2nd (Broadcast): During today's meeting of the Rules Committee, Byrnes had the first public dispute with Soviet Representative Molotov over Poland's request to attend the Committee on Treaties with Hungary. Byrnes rejected Poland's request, saying that the United States adhered to the decision of the four powers, only allowing countries that had fought with the Axis satellite states to have the right to speak on the treaties. To avoid a public conflict between Byrnes and Molotov, Poland finally withdrew its request.</p>
<h3>Differences Between Large and Small Countries Should Not Be Confrontational, Casting a Shadow on the Conference, Canadian Prime Minister King Delivers a Speech, Czech Representative Says Willing to Remain Loyal to the Allied Powers</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Paris (Broadcast): The Fifth Plenary Session of the Conference was held at 4:02 PM today (midnight in Shanghai). Czech delegation leader Masaryk delivered a speech, saying that the agreement on the rights of national minorities in Czechoslovakia was the same as before the war. Masaryk did not specify which minority, but everyone knew that he was referring to the Hungarian minority in Czechoslovakia. These Hungarians had special rights in accordance with the agreement after the First World War. During recent Czech-Hungarian talks, the Hungarian Foreign Minister requested the restoration of this agreement on special rights for national minorities. Masaryk went on to praise France and said that Czechoslovakia would always be loyal to the Allied Powers and was proud to be a Slavic country. Czech troops fought in Ukraine, participated in the Battle of Dunkirk, and fought alongside the troops of the great ally, the United States. Our Czech delegation will make suggestions at the conference. He also emphasized that Czechoslovakia never wanted to seek any revenge.</p>
<p>Masaryk delivered his speech in English, first expressing respect to France, and then saying that neighboring countries in the East and West hope to mutually guarantee their security for many years to come. We should recognize the situation in Central Europe and the deep reasons for the two world wars. We must understand the tragic failure of past methods and try to find new solutions. Czechoslovakia is willing to dedicate its loyalty to peace, progressive democracy, and its Allied countries.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Paris, 2nd (Broadcast): In today's plenary session of the conference, following the Czech Foreign Minister, Canadian Prime Minister King spoke. King requested that the conference not make decisions on disputed parts of the treaty and requested the four powers to hold a foreign ministers' meeting at the same time to expedite the attainment of final peace. King emphasized that divisions must be reduced among all countries, which is the sincere desire of the participants and the world. King continued that geographically speaking, the status of Central Europe is not closely related to us, but we should not deny the fact that we participated in the war very early, because we immediately realized that world peace is a whole and cannot be divided. Our hope has not been achieved.</p>
<p>The purpose of this conference is not only to revise the draft treaty, but also to express respective opinions on certain issues in order to reach a general agreement. However, it is a pity that the conflict of interests between large and small countries has resulted in an unnecessary confrontation, which has cast a shadow on the true goal of the conference.</p>
<h3>Bevin May Attend Special Meeting of Four Foreign Ministers Next Week</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 2nd] Foreign Minister Bevin has been unwell for quite some time, but has now recovered slightly and may attend the special meeting of foreign ministers to be held next week, which is not yet certain.

<h3>Organizational Law of Conference Announced, Conference Chair Rotates Among Four Powers</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 1st] The organizational law of the Paris Peace Conference was announced today, the same as proposed by the Four Foreign Ministers' meeting. The conference is divided into three parts: the plenary session, the committee, and the secretariat. The plenary session decides on various issues to be referred to the relevant committees for study. The committees submit reports on the issues discussed by the plenary session and present their views for adoption by the plenary session. The conference establishes a general committee, attended by all member states, which will coordinate the work of the other committees. A special committee is established for each treaty to study the various political clauses. The special committee is composed of representatives of the four powers and representatives of the countries that participated in the war. Two economic committees are also established, one to study the economic problems of Italy and the other to study the economic problems of other Axis satellite states. In addition, military, judicial, and drafting committees will be established, attended by all member states of the conference, and subcommittees may be established as necessary. The chairman of the plenary session is rotated among the four powers in alphabetical order, changing every three days. However, the initial meeting will be chaired by France as the host country. The conference will invite representatives from Italy, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Finland to express their opinions, and may invite other countries. English, French, and Russian are the official languages of the conference.</p>

<h3>Division of Opinions Between Britain and the United States on Palestine Issue, Attlee and Truman Talk Across the Ocean</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 1st] The Evening Standard reported that Prime Minister Attlee discussed the Palestine issue with President Truman via transatlantic telephone today.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 1st] Prime Minister Attlee flew back from Paris yesterday morning to attend a special cabinet meeting to discuss the Palestine issue. British Chief of Staff Montgomery also attended to provide advice. The surprise of British officials at President Truman's dissatisfaction with the Palestine partition plan proposed by British and American experts is obvious. Lord President of the Council Morrison declared that whether Britain accepts the Palestine partition plan depends on the attitude of the United States and hopes that the United States can provide support. Shortly thereafter, President Truman telegraphed the delegation in London to return home for consultations.</p>
<p>Roundtable Meeting to be Held This Month</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 1st] Colonial Secretary Hall told the House of Commons that he hopes the London Roundtable Conference to discuss the Palestine partition plan can be held in mid-August. The British Foreign Office also said that Transjordan and Saudi Arabia have accepted the invitation to participate in the roundtable conference. It is not yet known whether other Arab countries are willing to participate.</p>
<p>[United Press, Alexandria, 1st] The Iraqi government telegraphed the Secretary-General of the Arab League today, requesting an emergency meeting to discuss the Palestine issue.</p>
<p>Enable the Two Peoples to Achieve Autonomy</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 1st] The House of Commons debated the Palestine issue today. Minister of Commerce Cripps spoke on behalf of the Cabinet, saying: Our ultimate goal is to complete the autonomy of the two major peoples of Palestine. Under the mandate, the British government has the responsibility to decide the future of Palestine and should not be determined by terrorism or riots. Cripps also said that the British government does not trust that a joint government composed of Jews and Arabs can be promoted under the current situation. However, dividing Palestine outright is too drastic and abrupt. The fairest way for us to treat the Arab and Jewish peoples equally is to implement large-scale autonomy in designated territories. Cripps also said:</p>
<p>Jewish Refugees Coming in Waves</p>
<p>[Reuters, Jerusalem, 1st] Reliable sources say that a fleet of ships fully loaded with Jewish refugees, about five ships, is sailing from the central Mediterranean towards Palestine.</p>
<h3>U.S. Air Force Day, Truman Delivers Speech</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 2nd] President Truman delivered a speech last night at a special banquet commemorating the 29th anniversary of the founding of the U.S. Air Force, strongly stating that the United States does not want to gain power, reparations, or territory as a result of victory. All that the United States needs is a just peace. He also said that the United States has a huge air force and army and navy, which is sufficient to maintain peace. The U.S. Air Force has made outstanding achievements in wartime and also has an important mission in peacetime. If our country wants peace, it must first have a guard force to maintain it.</p>
<h3>Forgiving the Giant Elephant, Challenging the Rat, Churchill Ridicules the Government</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 1st] Lower House today Palestine Churchill said that the British government will prepare to put 400 million Indians in the terror of civil war. Any events that may occur in Palestine, compared with the state of India, is like the battle of the rat and the battle of the giant elephant. We are ready to transfer the independence of India to the hands of mutually hostile people. We have announced that we are ready to abandon the Indian continent and our achievements there for two hundred years. We have defended Egypt twice, but we are ready to abandon the important canal area, but for little Palestine, we hold the determination not to let go until death, even if it means fighting the Jews or the Arabs. It is truly puzzling. Perhaps the British government has had to retain a springboard in Palestine because it has already abandoned Egypt and the canal area. If so, we cannot avoid the charge of selfishness. I feel this is a major mistake that will greatly weaken our country's position.</p>
<h3>British-Indian Relations Precarious</h3>
<p>[United Press, New York, 1st] Relations between India and Britain are unusually tense, and if a partial solution cannot be reached, another crisis will arise. The Muslim League has refused to participate in the Constituent Assembly, which will open in late August or early September, to formulate an independent constitution for India, and has declared that it will begin "direct action" to achieve the goal of partition and build a separate Muslim state. Muslim leaders have called for a one-day closure on August 16 and a cessation of all non-political activities. It is expected that Muslim League leaders will explain the purpose of their "direct action" in detail on that day.</p>
<h3>U.S. Has New Weapon to Deal with Atomic Bomb Airplanes</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] San Francisco, 2nd (Broadcast): U.S. Army ordnance experts are studying a radio-controlled bomb with high destructive power that can explode in the formation of invading enemy bombers. The Army is unwilling to disclose the details of the bomb, but it is clearly intended to counter large formations of bombers carrying atomic bombs. This bomb is quite powerful, and when it explodes in the center of the bomber formation, it can cause the enemy aircraft formation to scatter or fly alone.</p>
<h3>Truman Signs Bill Establishing Civilian-Run Atomic Energy Commission</h3>
<p>First Batch of Peacetime Products</p>
<p>[Washington, 1st] President Truman has signed a bill establishing the Atomic Energy Control Commission, all of whose members are selected from civilian life. Four military technical experts will also cooperate with the commission. The development of military uses of atomic energy will be discussed with one of the four officers.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] London, 2nd (Broadcast): General Blandy issued a statement today predicting that after 1950, atomic energy will be used to propel ships, and later it will be used in aircraft.</p>
<p>[United Press, Oak Ridge, Tennessee, 2nd] The first batch of peacetime products from the government's large-scale atomic bomb program was handed over to research institutions today for research on cancer and other human ailments. The first batch of products consists of five pea-sized units of radioactive carbon, called "Carbon-14" (the weight of ordinary atomic carbon is 12). Each unit weighs 10/1000ths of an ounce and is worth $400, including manufacturing and shipping costs.</p>
<h3>Celebrating American Independence Day in President Truman's Hometown (Part 1): Listening to an Old Overseas Chinese Man Talk About the Past and Present</h3>
<p>— (Special Correspondent for this Newspaper in the United States, Mao Shuqing)</p>
<p>[Kansas City, July 10th, Airmail] On July 4th, American Independence Day, every household in Kansas City flew the American flag, and the streets were as quiet as if not a single bird chirped. People were enjoying their holiday. At 10:30 in the morning, Mr. He Liyuan, an old overseas Chinese man, drove to the Phillips Hotel. This seventy-year-old man was as energetic as a young man in his thirties. Hardly any Chinese students in the United States, especially those who came in the early days, did not know him. He was so diligent, humble, and friendly. He patted me on the shoulder and told me, "Mr. Mao, you probably weren't even born when I came to America!" He also said that when Mr. Xian Guang was studying at the University of Missouri, he was an old friend of his. Now in America, he still cares about Mr. Xian Guang’s son and son-in-law at all times. He could remember many students who studied in Missouri or Kansas. He never admitted he was old; he felt he was still young. This old overseas Chinese man was a "traditional Chinese medicine doctor" from Guandong. He had been to Shanghai twice in his early years. He has been in America for more than thirty years. Because he lived in Kansas City, he had a twenty-five-year friendship with the current master of the White House, President Truman. Even now, they still correspond frequently. He saw Truman working on the farm in his youth. He knew Truman's mother and brother, and he had a very close relationship with Truman's two nephews, who are now young men serving as a Navy Lieutenant Commander and an Army Captain.</p>
<p>Truman's Birthplace</p>
<p>Greenway Village, which is also where He Liyuan farmed in his early years. Greenway Village is thirteen miles from Kansas City. Consul Shen Zuogan and I sat in Elder He's car. The three of us drove along the main road. The countless villages outside Kansas City resembled the Yangtze River basin in China, with endless fields and orchards. Greenway Village is in the northeast of the city. The area of the entire village seems to be larger than the entire Kansas City. There are many large lawns in the village, which are golf courses. Many young Americans were playing golf to enjoy their national holiday. One manor after another, separated by seven or eight hundred meters, are remotely connected. Many of the manor owners are Jewish. The Jewish people accumulated money and bought land in the United States. They were bought in at very low prices back then, and now they have increased several times. In the middle of the village, there is a 140-acre manor with a "for sale" sign hanging on it. Inside there are fish ponds, lawns, farmland, hillsides, and countless large forests of trees. It is said that the "seller only wants 26,000 dollars." He said this was a very cost-effective deal. This manor for sale is not far from Greenway town. At the corner of the town is Mrs. Truman's residence.</p>
<p>It is a very small white wooden house, two stories high, with a small lawn outside. Outside the lawn is a newly built wire fence. I guess this is probably the only decoration Truman provided for his old mother after he "became successful." Truman's mother often lives here. That day we originally wanted to go and see "Mrs. Truman" by the way, but unfortunately, she was out, and the short door in the wire fence was locked with a large lock. Truman's father died early, and in his childhood, he lived a farming life here with his mother. His mother had four hundred acres of farmland. Because she did not have the money to pay the land tax, it was almost auctioned off and confiscated several times. The villagers called Truman the "cowherd." Truman's economic situation was quite miserable in his youth. Truman's mother was a frugal woman. She raised chickens and pigs, relying on meager income to maintain the family's economic life. President Truman and President Lincoln had the same poor origins, but their economic backgrounds in their youth were different. Lincoln was a self-reliant wandering youth, while Truman was a typical pastoral figure.</p>
<p>The characteristics of an agricultural society are stability and conservatism, which is obviously different from the cultivation of Lincoln's "great talent and strategy." Truman later went to the city to work as a shop clerk, studied law, and even became a judge of the state and county, and he was always known for his prudence and stability. He Liyuan, an old overseas Chinese man, still has a license to practice traditional Chinese medicine issued in 1930, which was issued when Truman was a state and county judge. However, the signature style of the word "Truman" is different from what it is now. From state and county judge to federal senator, he benefited from the "promotion" of one person. This person was the former mayor of Kansas City, Pendergast. Pendergast's prestige back then was the same as that of Chicago Mayor Kelly today. He was known as the "iron fist" behind the Democratic Party. The citizens of Kansas City also called him the "Pendergast machine," just like Chicago. In the United States, when someone is called a "machine" by a certain group, the meaning is both good and bad. "Machine" means that he has social power, prestige, manipulates local affairs, and is also the backstage of a national political party. But on the other hand, machine also implies that he monopolizes "prostitution, gambling, and drinking" and profits from it. But Pendergast finally fell out of luck. The reason was a report from within the Democratic Party. The person who reported Pendergast was the current speaker of the Kansas City Senate, Daly, who is also a powerful figure in the Democratic Party and an old friend of He Liyuan. He accused Pendergast of concealing "income tax," which in the United States, especially in the United States during the war, is regarded as extraordinary. The "lawsuit" at the time went to the Supreme Court in Washington. In the end, he was found guilty. Because of health problems, the court granted a "suspended sentence." During the suspension, this "benefactor" of Truman died of depression in Kansas City last year. Truman did not become rich because he became president. He Liyuan, an old overseas Chinese man, can determine this from Truman's family situation, because Elder He knows their family and knows that Truman had "deficits" every year during his tenure as a senator and had to ask the He family for subsidies. After 1930, Truman's younger brother still "farmed diligently" on the farm in Greenway Village, but gradually became rich due to the rising prices of agricultural products. Now, Truman's younger brother is the owner of a 700-acre farm in Greenway Village. Because it was a holiday, we did not meet this "agriculture-oriented" president's younger brother, but we carefully observed his farming. There were winter melons, potatoes, tomatoes, vegetables, and also rice and wheat. Truman's two nephews also have a new white house built on the side of the farm. They have all gone to war as officers. Elder He said, "They are in England."</p>
<p>Ordered to Economize on Expenses</p>
<p>[Washington, 1st] Truman, Chief of Staff of the Army, Eisenhower, Nimitz's protest. The Navy must save expenses. The Naval Bureau has also received the same order, and seven new-style mail ships will inevitably be stopped from construction. The United States has no large mail ships other than those converted from troop transports. Truman also issued an order to the heads of various agencies, stating that in order to avoid inflation and reduce public debt, all agencies must reduce expenditures to the minimum.</p>
<h3>The United States Requests the Far Eastern Commission to Revise the Japanese Reparations Plan</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 1st] It was learned today that the United States has requested the Far Eastern Commission to completely abolish the previously drafted Japanese reparations plan and redraft it based on the new American proposal. The proposal was submitted last week and is currently under review by the commission. It is understood that the proposal suggests establishing another institution under the Far Eastern Commission, which would report to the Far Eastern Commission. However, all staff should devote their full time to drafting the reparations plan. The institution will continue to hold meetings to reach an appropriate decision based on the German reparations plan of the Paris Peace Conference. The Paris Peace Conference has decided on the allocation amounts for the countries that fought against Germany, stipulated the division of German assets at home and abroad, and decided how the Allied countries should obtain these assets. The United States is dissatisfied with the work of the State Department and the Pauley Reparations Mission in the Far Eastern Commission, so it has proposed this plan to improve it.</p>
<h3>Malignant Inflation: Japanese Banknote Issuance Exceeds 50 Billion Yen</h3>
<p>[Kaizo-sha, Tokyo, 2nd] The amount of Japanese banknotes issued has exceeded the 50 billion yen mark. As of the end of July, the total amount of banknotes issued was 49.73 billion yen. Yesterday, due to withdrawals for living expenses, etc., approximately 300 million yen was re-issued. The amount of Japanese banknotes inflated in July totaled 6.972 billion yen, an average daily increase of 25.8 million yen.</p>
<h3>Far Eastern International Tribunal: Witnesses Maintain Consistent Style, Blaming the Kwantung Army for the Northeast Incident, Attempting to Exonerate the Japanese Government</h3>
<p>[Kaizo-sha, Tokyo, 2nd] The Far Eastern International Tribunal continued to summon Mamoru Shigemitsu, former ambassador to Portugal, to testify today. According to the witnesses summoned by the Far Eastern Tribunal, from former Director of the Military Affairs Bureau Takayoshi Tanaka to Shigemitsu, their testimonies have been consistent, maintaining a consistent style, that is, attributing the outbreak of the Northeast Incident to the ideas and actions of some officers of the Kwantung Army and other individuals, attempting to exonerate the Japanese government and further avoid involving the Japanese Emperor.</p>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 2nd] The Far Eastern International Tribunal continued to try Japanese war criminals today. The prosecutor's witness, Mamoru Shigemitsu, who was the consul-general in Shenyang in 1931, testified that the Kwantung Army should be held responsible for the bombing of Zhang Zuolin in Huanggu Tun. Prime Minister Tanaka had planned to interrogate the instigators behind the case, but was opposed by Japanese military personnel, and the Tanaka cabinet resigned as a result. Tanaka's policy towards Manchuria seemed to be based on maintaining order in Manchuria, protecting the Japanese and their legitimate interests in Manchuria and mainland China, not interfering in China's internal affairs, and supporting the open-door policy. However, the Tanaka cabinet's policy towards Manchuria was more active than that of its predecessor.</p>
<h3>Shigemitsu's Absurd Remarks Refuted by the Presiding Judge</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 2nd Dispatch] Mamoru Shigemitsu, the former Japanese consul-general in Shenyang, under severe cross-examination by the International Tribunal this morning, turned to testify in favor of the defendants, saying that in view of the revolutionary crisis facing the troops under Chiang Kai-shek at the time, the Kwantung Army had no choice but to take action to protect the lives and property of Japanese people in Northeast China. He also claimed that after Zhang Zuolin was murdered, a fierce anti-Japanese movement formed in Northeast China. Shigemitsu believed that this was due to Zhang Xueliang's inclination towards the Kuomintang and Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People (infiltrating) into Northeast China. When Shigemitsu attributed the Kwantung Army's use of force in Northeast China to the high level of anti-Japanese sentiment in the area, Judge Webb interrupted him and reprimanded him, saying: "Mere speculation has no value as testimony."</p>
<h3>Iranian Prime Minister Sadanah Forms New Cabinet</h3>
<p>Still Holds Three Positions, Equal Balance of Power Between Two Factions</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Tehran, 1st] Iran's new cabinet has been formed, and the leftist Tudeh Party has also joined the government for the first time. According to the public announcement, Sadanah remains Prime Minister and Minister of Interior and Foreign Affairs. Tudeh Party members obtained three ministries, namely Ghassem Ghevari as Minister of Education, Eskandari as Minister of Industry and Commerce, and Yazdi as Minister of Health. In addition, government spokesperson Prince Firouz, Minister of Social Propaganda Tamaddon, and Army Chief Ahmadi have not been transferred. Former Minister of Finance Hakimi has rejoined. According to observers here, Iran's new cabinet is an equal distribution of power between the "pro-Russian faction" and the "pro-British faction."</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Executes Traitors</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 2nd] Soviet traitor General Vlasov and his eleven subordinates, who organized a Soviet auxiliary team during the war to help the German army fight, committed heinous crimes. After being sentenced to death by the court, they were executed by firing squad today.</p>
<h3>Sketches of the Nuremberg Tribunal: The Fat Goering is the Most Dignified One; Crowds of Spectators Gather Outside the Fence</h3>
<p>[United Press, Nuremberg, 1st] The 22 Nazi war criminals on trial at the Nuremberg Tribunal have become the biggest tourist attraction in Germany. During each recess, spectators crowded outside the fence, wanting to see the faces of the criminals. Some shouted: "Look at Hess! Look at Streicher! He's eating bread!" Some spectators stared at them with binoculars, which particularly annoyed the prisoners. The gaunt and red-headed former Chief of the German General Staff, Jodl, was furious. Sometimes he circled his hands around his eyes, as if holding a pair of binoculars, to look back at the annoying spectators, muttering scoldings in German. This trick often caused laughter, which made Jodl even more angry. This group of Nazi leaders, who committed heinous crimes, have mostly lost their arrogance due to their long-term imprisonment. When German lawyers presented their final defenses, they were either stunned or looked around the court listlessly. Eight months of long-winded speeches have exhausted the entire court, and the climax of the trial felt dull instead. Only during recess did the defendants recover from their semi-coma, exchange notes, and make slight jokes. Goering still appeared to be the most dignified and imposing. He was most respected by the court because he did not hide anything and continued to be loyal to the deceased Hitler. Americans like loyal people. He suffers from sciatica. According to court officials: "He lost interest after his attempt to make Hitler a legendary figure failed. When German lawyers slandered Hitler, Goering buried his face in his hands and shook his head slightly.</p>

<h3>Zhang Zhiben Convenes Trade Associations, Soliciting Opinions on Investigation and Acceptance, Representatives Speak Up, Secret Documents Submitted on the Spot, Cheng Zhonghang Expresses Regret, Determined to Get to the Bottom of the Matter</h3>
<p>Zhang Zhiben, head of the Suzhou, Zhejiang, and Anhui District Enemy and Puppet Assets Reception and Handling Work Investigation Team, and committee members Cheng Zhonghang, Fan Zhengbo, Zhang Qingzhen, and Wu Ji, convened a discussion meeting at the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce hall at 3:00 PM yesterday, inviting opinions from various trade associations in the city regarding the investigation and acceptance work. Present were Xu Ji, chairman of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, directors and supervisors Jin Runku, Wang Lai, and Lu Yinggeng, as well as representatives from 98 trade associations, including Luo Beichen, Pan Shihao, Wang Zhaocheng, Zhu Jianping, Ding Xiong Zhao, Zhou Jiasheng, and Xi Hanying, totaling over 120 people. Xu Ji first introduced Team Leader Zhang and the four committee members, Cheng, Fan, Zhang, and Wu, to the trade association representatives. The entire assembly applauded in unison to welcome them.</p>
<p>Zhang Zhiben's Address</p>
<p>Team Leader Zhang Zhiben was then invited to give an address, stating: "I am deeply gratified by the enthusiastic participation of representatives from various trade associations in today's discussion meeting, which fully demonstrates cooperation with our team. I would like to express my gratitude to everyone. We know that if the reception work had been done thoroughly, and everything was reasonable and legal, there would be no need for an investigation. The establishment of our country stems from the fact that many things in the past did not meet the expectations of the people. We are a democratic country, and the government and the people should cooperate, and the people should help each other. At the beginning of the reception work, the receiving personnel failed to cooperate closely with the people, which created a divide. Today, our team has come to Shanghai, and we still need to cooperate with the people to achieve results. I remember that when the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce held a meeting in 1922, everyone held the attitude of 'merchants speaking as merchants, educators speaking as educators.' This was a great mistake. As political scientists tell us, 'Humans are political animals.' Living in today's world, we should all humbly study and sincerely criticize all political issues that concern us. For example, after the war, everyone hoped that domestic order would be stabilized and production would be restored as soon as possible, but under today's domestic turmoil, it is naturally difficult to achieve safety. Secondly, the main mission of our team is to investigate and report the situation of the reception work to the central government. However, our funding and manpower are not enough, and we must obtain your assistance to carry out our work. Because trade associations have a better understanding of the details of the reception work, they can definitely provide us with many clues, allowing us to investigate in this way, so that we will not fail your enthusiastic hope for us to 'judge fairly.' Although the duration of our work in this country is relatively short, we will definitely handle all issues in the fastest and most economical way. Now, I hope everyone will express their opinions as much as possible."</p>
<p>Cheng Zhonghang's Address</p>
<p>Subsequently, Committee Member Cheng Zhonghang gave an address, first explaining that the purpose of convening the discussion meeting was to hear from the representatives of various trade associations. He then supplemented Team Leader Zhang's remarks, stating: "The reception work has been in turmoil from last year until now, causing a stir both domestically and abroad. This is truly a disgrace. The responsibility to wash away this disgrace rests first with the government, and also with the people. There has always been a kind of morbidity in our society's atmosphere, which is that everyone likes to criticize behind their backs regarding any matter, but is unwilling to report it directly. This is an irresponsible manifestation. The lack of progress in Chinese politics over the years may have been rooted in this morbidity. Today, we ask business leaders to speak frankly and without reservation about the mistakes in the reception work, and fully demonstrate a responsible spirit. Our team sincerely and attentively accepts your opinions, and hopes to cooperate with you. Shanghai is an extremely complex city, and the problems that have arisen in the reception work must be numerous. Our team has been sent to this place to conduct investigation work, and based on our estimated funding and manpower, we feel that it is not enough. How can we not fail our mission and make the investigation work have some effect? It really depends on your assistance. In other words, our strength is your strength, and our achievements are your achievements. I hope that everyone can demonstrate their due civic responsibility today, provide us with many clues, and work together to complete our mission." After Mr. Cheng's address, representatives from various trade associations successively expressed their opinions.</p>
<p>Vegetable Oil</p>
<p>The representative of the Vegetable Oil Trade Association put forward five appeals: (1) The Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau does not accept requests from civil organizations, does not show sympathy for the suffering of the people, and delays returning privately owned property, causing significant losses to the people. (2) Received warehouse materials are neglected and mishandled, and countless items have rotted and been damaged. (3) The materials stored in the enemy warehouses that have been taken over cannot be allocated for use by the people. (4) The enemy and puppet factories that have been taken over cannot be quickly restored to work, and are only sold for profit, which has a significant impact on the future of economic construction. (5) The Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau has never approached public organizations, and its style should be changed.</p>
<p>Cotton Cloth</p>
<p>The representative of the Cotton Cloth Trade Association believed that the investigation work must (1) ascertain the facts, and (2) call attention. He explained that during the 1943 period, the dyeing and weaving industry, the cotton cloth industry, and the yarn industry had over 100,000 bales of yarn and over 6 million bolts of cloth forcibly seized by the enemy and puppets. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the puppet Merchants Association had over 2 million bolts of cotton cloth and over 10,000 bales of yarn in storage. The Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau should have returned them after taking them over. At that time, our association and others submitted a request, but the bureau claimed (1) that it was impossible to verify, and (2) that the compensation was generous, and refused to return them.</p>
<p>Cotton Yarn</p>
<p>The representative of the Commercial Trade Association pointed out: (1) During the period when the enemy and puppets controlled Shanghai, our industry suffered a loss of 350 billion due to exploitation, but the government did not return the enemy and puppet yarn after taking it over. (2) The Ministry of Economic Affairs purchased cotton yarn without showing any sympathy for the difficulties of the merchants, and completely adopted coercive measures.</p>
<p>Steamships</p>
<p>Li Yunliang, representative of the Steamship Association, stated: Before the war, there were 500,000 tons of domestic steamships, of which over 300,000 tons were sacrificed due to the Anti-Japanese War. Most of them were sunk in the Jiangyin and Madang area under the government's order for blockade purposes. The government issued receipts and, according to the Military Conscription Law, should compensate for the loss. The shipping industry has repeatedly requested the government, and the Executive Yuan has approved the compensation, but it has not yet been implemented. The Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau took over ships from enemy and puppet organizations such as the East Asia Shipping Construction Association, the China Steamship Company, the Shanghai Inland River Steamship Company, and the Central China Steamboat Association, totaling about 300,000 tons, which were all taken over by the state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and not allocated to private companies. More than 30 motorized junks approved for lease by the Ministry of Communications were leased and operated by the Civil Aviation Motorized Junk Joint Operations Office, organized by all shipping companies, to transport relief supplies and government materials, and to maintain the livelihood of some unemployed employees. Now, the Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau has suddenly put them up for sale, causing the Motorized Junk Joint Operations Office, which was established not long ago, to disintegrate again. We sincerely request that the country investigate the reception of ships and the reasons why they cannot be handled, and request prompt compensation and allocation of enemy and puppet ships to restore the original pre-war foundation.</p>
<p>Inland River Steamships</p>
<p>The representative of the Trade Association explained (1) that the Shanghai Inland River Steamship Company, an enemy and puppet organization, should be returned for liquidation, with the principles being (A) enemy and puppet shares confiscated, (B) privately owned shares forcibly requisitioned returned, and (C) voluntary investments confiscated. (2) Compensate for ships lost in the Anti-Japanese War. (3) Stop the sale of inland river ships to facilitate the revival of inland river shipping.</p>
<p>Rayon</p>
<p>And the Rubber Money Association representative appealed for three points: (1) The Ministry of Economic Affairs attempts to make exorbitant profits by receiving materials worth tens of thousands of yuan and selling them for more than one million yuan, which is inconsistent with the government's policy of stabilizing prices. (2) Very few factories have been put up for sale by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and most have not resumed work. (3) Factories are sold at high prices, and privately owned factories cannot afford to purchase them.</p>
<p>Electrical</p>
<p>The representative of the Commercial Trade Association painfully explained that the Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau takes advantage of its position to benefit itself, and delays returning privately owned assets. At the same time, it does not strictly manage the sealed warehouses, causing the country to suffer great losses.</p>
<p>After listening to the reports of the representatives, Committee Member Cheng Zhonghang stood up again to address the audience. Regarding the various points made by the representatives against the Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau, he hoped that they could appeal directly to the Review Committee of the bureau regarding improper matters such as the procedures for selling materials, because the Review Committee is the highest decision-making body of the bureau for handling enemy and puppet assets and should be able to listen to the opinions of the public. Mr. Cheng expressed with emotion: "The reception and handling of enemy and puppet assets has really caused widespread resentment among the people. How could our government and our supreme leader allow them to do such things? Today, we have received many valuable opinions, and we must get to the bottom of the matter based on the clues, and wash away the many stains. We hope that you will continue to maintain contact with us in the future, so that we can exert the effect of supervision." Finally, Team Leader Zhang explained that everyone's opinions were very valuable and could serve as a reference for the team's work, and hoped that all parties would provide more written materials. After Team Leader Zhang finished speaking, the representatives of various trade associations submitted secret documents one after another, with extremely tense and enthusiastic emotions, until around 6 o'clock.</p>

<h3>Two Chief Culprits, Isoya Koshiro and Tani Hisao, Transferred to Military Court Today, Tani Hisao Tries to Shirk Responsibility for the Nanjing Massacre, Isoya Frankly Admits to Crimes of Aggression Against China</h3>
<p>Isoya Koshiro and Tani Hisao, two major war criminals who launched the war of aggression against China, were escorted to Shanghai by special plane on the evening of the day before yesterday after the Ministry of National Defense ordered our delegation stationed in Japan to consult with the United States. They were detained in the officers' and generals' detention center of the War Criminals Management Office of the Ministry of National Defense. It is now learned that the two criminals are scheduled to be transferred to the Shanghai Military Court this morning for interrogation and trial in accordance with the law. A reporter from the Central News Agency went to the detention center in Gaojing Temple, Jiangwan, yesterday, where Deputy Director Yao opened the door and guided the reporter to visit and talk with Isoya and others. The two criminals are imprisoned in separate rooms, isolated from other suspected war criminals of Japanese nationality, seemingly treated more favorably than other criminals. Two soldiers armed with guns were stationed outside the door to monitor them. When the reporter entered the room, the two criminals were sitting on the beds, looking quite worried. Because they had met and talked at the airport the day before, they both stood up to greet the reporter when they saw him. Tani Hisao immediately took off the black-rimmed glasses on his nose and raised his hand to offer a seat, looking extremely humble. It was found that Isoya was more straightforward and frank among the two criminals, and was also brave in admitting his past crimes. Tani Hisao, on the other hand, tried to cover up his crimes in various ways during the conversation. According to Isoya Koshiro, although he held the high position of Governor of Hong Kong after the Pacific War and was prominent for a time, he was arrested as a suspected war criminal this spring and transferred to China. He firmly believes that it is not related to his position as Governor of Hong Kong, so his crimes should belong to the events during his battle along the Jinpu Railway. If his subordinates had inhumane acts during the battle along the Jinpu Railway, he, as the commander, should bear full responsibility and be sentenced to the appropriate crime. China has suffered too much during the eight-year war between China and Japan, and Japan should be responsible. Although he was escorted to China as a war criminal, he sincerely hopes to apologize to Chinese friends. At this point, Isoya turned to brag about his achievements, saying that at the beginning of his tenure as Governor of Hong Kong, he released the Chinese who had been arrested by the Japanese army and ordered them to leave on their own, most of whom went to Chongqing and Shanghai. Isoya also said that after the Zhanggufeng Incident, he also participated in the "Nomonhan Incident" of the Soviet-Japanese conflict, when he served as the Chief of Staff of the Kwantung Army, and described in detail the defeat, dismissal, and the suicide of the commander of the Third Regiment by seppuku, which made him feel deeply emotional. As for Tani Hisao, he tried to shirk responsibility for the Nanjing Massacre, repeatedly claiming that he did not know, because he was only stationed in Nanjing for three days, and there were other divisions that attacked and occupied Nanjing at the same time, so he could not bear this responsibility. The reporter asked about the situation in Sugamo Prison after he was arrested this spring. According to the two criminals, Japan was short of food after the war, but the food in prison was supplied by the Japanese government, so they only had thin porridge every day and never had dry rice. The iron windows and stone walls of the prison were extremely strong, because they were made by the Japanese themselves. At this point, they could not help but laugh. The U.S. military manages the prison very strictly, and all detainees are not allowed to talk to each other. Tojo and others only saw each other during daily exercises. The family members of each criminal could only meet once a month.</p>
<h3>Three Enemy Military Police War Criminals Retried Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The military court, which had been silent for a long time, reopened yesterday morning with Judge Lu Qi presiding over the investigation of the case of enemy military police Yasuda Terutada burning down civilian houses, and the case of Miyamoto Jinpei and Maruyama Masato torturing and killing Lu Xiangshang. In the former case, the witness Yang Shixian proved that when the Japanese soldiers were burning the house, the villagers knelt down and begged Yasuda, but he was driven away with a command knife. In the latter case, Lu Xiangshang's concubine Wang Sanmei and the chauffeur Ma Jiajun, who was arrested at the same time, testified in court. Defendant Maruyama Masato admitted that he had arrested Lu Xiangshang, but still denied that he had tortured him. The court ordered that the case was clear and would be debated and judged at a later date.</p>

<h3>Qin Dechun Went to Nanjing Yesterday</h3>
<p>General Qin Dechun, Deputy Minister of National Defense, who had just returned to China from Tokyo, Japan, traveled to Nanjing by night train yesterday with Major General Zou Renzhi, Director of the War Criminals Management Office, to report on their duties.</p>
<h3>Two Flexible Measures for Handling Enemy and Puppet Factories and Mines</h3>
<p>Regarding the handling of the reception of enemy and puppet factories and mines, the Executive Yuan stipulated two flexible measures, ordering that those that have been sold twice without success be sold according to one of the following methods: 1. Pay the full price at 70% of the estimated price in one lump sum; 2. Pay one-third of the original estimated amount first, and then pay one-third every six months thereafter. (2) If the factories and mines still cannot be sold according to the previous method, they will be leased to private companies. Second, for privately owned factories and mines with enemy and puppet added equipment or houses, the original owners are allowed to have priority in purchasing them after valuation. Those who cannot afford to pay the price in one lump sum may pay the price of the houses in installments, but at most for no more than two years.</p>

<h3>City Government Cooperative Manager Embezzles, Li Jiancheng Detained After Interrogation, Accounting Director Zhu Zhiqing Released on Bail of One Million in Cash</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The case of embezzlement by Li Jiancheng, manager of the City Government Employee Consumer Cooperative, and Zhu Zhiqing, accounting director, was prosecuted by the District Prosecutor's Office. Yesterday morning, Wu Xiangzu, presiding judge of the District Court, and Prosecutor Fu Bang tried the case in the Second Criminal Court. Li Jiancheng testified that he was 40 years old, from Fenghua, and was originally a commissioner of the City Government. He was appointed manager of the cooperative on January 28 this year, and was elected by the board of directors produced by the members' meeting. The cooperative was filed with the Social Affairs Bureau. The fund was allocated by the Social Affairs Bureau for more than 14 million yuan, and the members' shares were more than 1.6 million yuan, totaling more than 16 million yuan. The manager's authority is to be responsible for business matters, and the use of personnel is the responsibility of the board of directors and supervisors. The amount of 14,428,748.88 yuan on the income and expenditure budget form on May 4 was used to purchase a No. 1666 car, which was purchased from Li Wenhu through the introduction of Chen Wenyin, and not to purchase trucks and thermos bottles. Regarding the repair of the car, it was repaired in the City Government's vehicle affairs office, and invoices were issued for a total of 1.05 million yuan for three repairs. The new car was purchased in the name of Li Xiaxing, because the price of the car was high, and he was afraid that the directors would object, so he did not use the name of the cooperative. Zhu Zhiqing testified that he was 40 years old, from Fenghua, and was transferred from the accounting office of the City Government to serve as the accounting director of the cooperative on March 21. The income and expenditure budget form on May 4 was made by Li. He originally wanted to sell the car, earn some money, and then buy trucks and thermos bottles. Then the witness, Lu Bofu, an employee sent by the City Bank to audit the cooperative's accounts, said that Zhu stamped all the vouchers, and he only knew that the account on the income and expenditure budget form on May 4 was used to purchase trucks and thermos bottles. Next, Wu Xianran, the head of the cooperative's cashier section, testified that he paid the money according to the vouchers. The large payment on May 4 was paid in eight installments. At this point, the defendant's defense lawyers Wang Boxian, Li Wanxiang, and Zheng Wentong stood up one after another, requesting permission for the defendant to be released on bail, but the court did not allow it, and the hearing was scheduled for August 14 in the morning. Li Jiancheng was detained again, and Zhu Zhiqing was released on bail of 1 million yuan in cash.</p>
<h3>Peddlers in Huangpu and Laozha Districts Eliminated in Stages</h3>
<p>The City Police Bureau's rules for banning peddlers have been approved by yesterday's Municipal Council meeting, and the location of the concentration points has been stipulated. The Municipal Council meeting discussed this case in detail yesterday. Because various peddlers are now densely distributed throughout the city, especially in Huangpu District and Laozha District, it was decided that the concentration points stipulated by the Police Bureau will be temporarily implemented. Peddlers in Huangpu District and Laozha District will be eliminated by drawing lots, one-third at the end of the month, another one-third at the end of September, and by the end of October, peddling will not be allowed in Huangpu District and Laozha District.</p>

<h3>Seeking Opinions to Revise Labor Regulations: The Ministry of Social Affairs Convened Industry and Commerce for Symposiums to Resolve Labor Issues Through Social Coordination, with Social Insurance as the Most Effective Method</h3>
<p>Given that the labor regulations established in the past are no longer entirely suitable for the present circumstances, the Ministry of Social Affairs is urgently seeking revisions. To gather opinions from all sides for reference, they specially invited representatives from Shanghai's industrial and commercial sectors to a symposium held yesterday at 2:00 PM on the ninth floor of the Wing On Building. Attendees included Minister Gu Zhenggang of the Ministry of Social Affairs, Division Chief Lu Jingshi, Division Chief Ouyang Lun of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, as well as Mao Qingxiang, Wang Xiaolai, Du Yuesheng, Wang Yansong, Shu Yunchang, Ji, Xi Yushu, Zhu Xuefan, Liu Hongsheng, Zhou Xuexiang, Shui Xiangyun, Wu Yunxu, Jin Runyang, Chuan Rulin, Li Jianhua, Zhang Naiqi, Ying Chengyi, and over seventy others.</p>
<p>Minister Gu</p>
<p>Acting as chairman, Minister Gu stated in his address, "Labor regulations are divided into two parts: the Factory Law and the Trade Union Law. Today, we are discussing the Factory Law. The Factory Law was promulgated in 1929, and amended in 1932 and 1937. It has been nearly ten years since then, and it is no longer suitable for addressing the current domestic and international situation. I sincerely hope that everyone will express their opinions on the actual situation of industry and commerce to provide reference for the government's revision of labor regulations. I would also like to report that the spirit of the government's labor policy lies in how to coordinate labor and capital, that is, to give equal importance to both sides. Foreign labor policies each have their own particularities. For example, the Soviet Union focuses on the labor side, while the United Kingdom and the United States place more emphasis on the capital side. Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the founding father, used social coordination to solve labor problems, and the government's labor policy is based on the principle of adhering to Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings. During the War of Resistance, due to special circumstances, some regulations could not be implemented in sequence. Now that the War of Resistance has been won, normal conditions should be restored, and all regulations must be implemented. Under the goals of 'political democratization' and 'economic industrialization,' the revision of labor regulations must be based on the general opinions of the people. Today, we have representatives of capital, labor, and many experts. I hope everyone will express their opinions as much as possible, and the government will adopt them as much as possible within its capabilities." Finally, Mr. Gu raised several points for the attendees to pay special attention to: (1) the scope of application of the Factory Law, (2) the issue of collective agreements, (3) the wage issue, (4) the factory inspection issue, (5) the factory meeting issue, and (6) the labor welfare issue. Next, Xie Zhengfu, Director of the Legal System Committee of the Ministry of Social Affairs, explained the key points of the Factory Law revision, including the scope of factories in Article 1 of Chapter 1, the replacement of child and female workers with young workers and adolescent workers in Chapter 2, the prohibition of night work for child and female workers in Article 13, and detailed explanations of work contracts in Chapter 6, worker allowances in Chapter 9, and the issue of pensions. Subsequently, individuals expressed their opinions, including Liu Hongsheng, Chuan Rulin, Wu Yunxu, Zhang Naiqi, and Xue Xuefan, among over ten others, all contributing valuable opinions.</p>
<p>Joint Efforts to Prevent Labor Disputes</p>
<p>Finally, Minister Gu summarized the opinions from all parties and made a proposal for implementing social insurance, stating that it is permissible to implement Shanghai insurance and unemployment insurance for workers who have economic insecurities. The Ministry has already approved the establishment of the Central Social Insurance Bureau Preparatory Office within this year to actively carry out preparatory work. Social insurance is the most effective method of labor-capital coordination, benefiting workers by ensuring their livelihoods and improving their welfare, and benefiting capital by improving labor efficiency and increasing business. It is also the most concrete form of cooperation between the government, labor, and capital. This issue is closely related to everyone, and I would like to take this opportunity to bring it up. We are willing to work together with the gentlemen of the industrial and labor circles.</p>
<h3>Wu Yunqi, Yan Chuntang, and Others Prosecuted by the High Procuratorate</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] Wu Yunqi, 60 years old, from Jujiang, Jiangsu, graduated from Waseda University in Japan with a bachelor's degree. He successively served as a chief clerk in the Ministry of Revenue of the Qing Dynasty, a section chief in the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce, a director and assistant manager of Jin Cheng Bank, and the manager of the Shanghai branch. Because he served as the chairman and general manager of the puppet newspaper and a supervisor of the puppet Chamber of Commerce during the occupation period in Shanghai, he was arrested by the authorities after the victory and transferred to the court. After the High Procuratorate completed its investigation of his crimes, it formally filed a public prosecution.</p>
<p>In addition, Yan Chuntang, the founder of the former Yihua Film Company, as well as Jiang Shangda, Zhang Shuchun, Zhang Guangdou, Zhou Songping, Liu Zhaoding, Jian, Zhu Deguo, Dai Yunpeng, and others were all prosecuted by the High Procuratorate on suspicion of being traitors.</p>
<p>Qian Jieyi Sentenced to Three Years</p>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] Qian Jieyi, a former member of the puppet Jiangsu Provincial Government and director of the Suzhou branch of the puppet China Cooperative Society, was yesterday sentenced by the High Court to three years of imprisonment, deprivation of public rights for three years, and confiscation of all property except for the necessary living expenses for his family.</p>
<p>In addition, in the case of Sun Yaodong, the manager of the puppet Fuxing Bank, Jin Weibai was brought to court from prison for questioning yesterday. According to Jin's testimony, Sun had participated in the work of the Loyal Salvation Army. The special tax on gold collected by the "Fuxing Bank" during the enemy-puppet period was related to the defection work. The proceeds from the tax collection were intended to be used as funds for defection work behind enemy lines during the major counteroffensive. The case was adjourned for further questioning.</p>
<p>The cases of Sha Yunde and Lu Maochang, informants for the Gendarmerie Corps, and other suspected traitors, were also adjourned for further questioning after witnesses Yi Ren and Chen Xinfu were summoned to court for questioning yesterday.</p>
<p>Insufficient Evidence Against Zhang Suwan</p>
<p>Zhang Suwan (female) was also arrested by the authorities after the victory on suspicion of being a traitor and sent to the court, where she was detained in Shanghai Prison. Later, she was released on bail. Recently, the High Procuratorate concluded its investigation of the case and decided not to prosecute due to insufficient evidence.</p>
<h3>Xue Gengxin and Shen Qinghua Under Investigation Yesterday</h3>
<p>Xue Gengxin, the director of the intelligence department of the puppet Special Service Headquarters, fled to North China after the victory. After extensive searching, he was finally arrested and escorted to Shanghai last month, where he was imprisoned in Shanghai Prison. Yesterday morning, the High Procuratorate brought him out of prison to investigate his crimes. In addition, Shen Qinghua, the former county magistrate of Wu County, was also questioned in court for over ten rounds, and both were returned to prison to await further questioning.</p>
<h3>A Worker, Harboring a Grudge, Sues the Shop Owner; a Mediator Poses as an Official to Extort Money</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] Xu Bangda, a native of Chuansha, 46 years old, who runs the Xuchangxiang Plank Box Shop at No. 79 Mo Fang Street, was recently falsely accused by a worker, Gu Haisheng, of concealing enemy and puppet materials at the time of the victory because his loan request was not granted. Gu secretly reported Xu to a certain agency in the city and then used the two original copies of the report to extort Xu, demanding 2 million legal tender to settle the matter and prevent further investigation. At this time, a person claiming to be an official from a certain bureau, Xu Heshang, mediated, agreeing to pay the money at Guanshengyuan in Lao Ximen at 6:00 PM yesterday.

<h3>Zhou Lunyuan Interrogated Yesterday for Concealing the Assets of Traitor Shao Shijun</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] Shao Shijun, the Director of the Puppet Unified Tax Bureau, was known as the "God of Wealth." After the victory, Shao fled in fear of punishment. The High Procuratorate filed a public prosecution and sent letters to the military police and other parties, ordering his arrest. Part of his confiscated property was found at the residence of Shen Shushi, a doctor, and Zhou Lunyuan, the assistant manager of the "Huatong Enterprise Company." The High Procuratorate filed a public prosecution against both of them for concealing the assets of a traitor, violating Article 12 of the Regulations on Punishing Traitors. The case was heard in the High Court yesterday afternoon. Only Zhou Lunyuan appeared in court. According to Zhou's testimony, he is 57 years old, from Ningbo, and a distant relative of Shao. Shao was a major shareholder of "Huatong Enterprise Company," which was located at No. 255 Hamilton Building. Zhou served as an assistant manager in the company. Shao's large hall furniture was borrowed by Zhou from He Jichang, an accountant in the company. At first, he did not know it was Shao Shijun's property. The estimated value of the furniture at the end of November last year was over 10 million puppet currency, but it was confiscated by the Enemy Property Management Bureau two months ago. As for the allegation that Zhou purchased US$200,000 for Shao and bought real estate, foreign currency, and stocks, this was all entrusted to "Huatong Enterprise Company" to handle and was not handled by Zhou himself. The case was adjourned for further questioning because further witness testimony was needed. The defendant remained released on the original bail.</p>

<h3>Father's Day to be Expanded into an International Holiday, Fundraising for Scholarships, Allocation of 1 Million for the Education of Xie Jinyuan's Children</h3>
<p>The Father's Day Promotion Committee has been meeting for several days to discuss various matters related to the August 8th Father's Day. The following matters can be reported: (1) This year's Father's Day was first initiated in Shanghai and approved by the Social Affairs Bureau. It has also been reported to the Central Government for a nationwide commemoration. The Promotion Committee has sent promotional materials such as the background of the Father's Day initiative and commemorative slogans to over 40 major cities across the country and to the areas where overseas Chinese are concentrated in Nanyang, entrusting the local Central News Agency to print and distribute them or directly send them to major newspapers for publication. Therefore, it is hoped that this year's Father's Day will be promoted uniformly nationwide. (2) The first step of the Promotion Committee is to make Father's Day a national holiday, and the second step is to promote it worldwide and make it an international holiday, similar to the nature of Mother's Day and Labor Day. International holidays have always been initiated by Europeans and Americans, but Father's Day was first initiated by the Chinese, so its significance is profound and self-evident. The committee has now had 20 initiators and sponsors jointly send letters to the ambassadors of the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, and France in China, requesting them to convey the proposal for a unified promotion in their respective countries. (3) The committee is actively conducting publicity in this city, such as radio broadcasts, slide shows in cinemas, street signs, and slogans, which will be seen by the public within days. (4) This year's Father's Day commemoration will focus on fundraising for scholarships, which has been entrusted to Shen Bao to collect, and the names of the donors will be published in Shen Xin and two newspapers. Donors who donate 50,000 yuan or more will have their names listed in a team to commemorate them. The committee has established a scholarship group with Pan Gongzhan, Gu Huiqing, Shi Zhifu, Lu Ganchen, Yan Du, Zhang Yi, and Xu Ji as members, hoping that those who are "filial and affectionate" will enthusiastically donate to achieve the set goal as soon as possible, so as to reward the poor, especially orphans. The committee will entrust major primary and secondary schools in the city to recommend hundreds of truly poor students for assistance. It was also resolved yesterday to allocate 1 million yuan for the education expenses of the children of General Xie Jinyuan, a hero of the Anti-Japanese War, in order to commemorate the Anti-Japanese heroes and leave a deep impression on every father.</p>

<h3>Recent News from Youth Middle School</h3>

<h3>Dong Xifan Issues Statement on Job Security for Middle School Teachers</h3>
<p>Several newspapers in Shanghai recently published a report about a conversation between Dong Xifan, President of Tongji University, and someone from the "Shanghai Middle School Teachers' Job Security Association." According to Mr. Dong, the content of the news report differed significantly from his original intention. When a member of the association visited the university, he said that the Education Bureau should issue an order to all middle school authorities prohibiting them from dismissing teachers without cause. Mr. Dong replied that he had just arrived in Shanghai and was not familiar with the local situation, and that he had no right to comment on matters at other schools. As for the employment of teachers, all schools should use teaching ability as the standard for evaluation, which is a natural principle and does not require a special order. If the matter of employment is based on teaching ability, then all those engaged in education will naturally agree. Therefore, the news report of the previous day inevitably took things out of context, and a statement should be made.</p>

<h3>The Perkins School for the Blind, the First Blind School in the United States, Founded in 1829</h3>
<p>The Perkins School for the Blind is located in the suburbs of Boston, Massachusetts, USA. There, blind children from all over the world walk, read, laugh, and play, happy like ordinary people. They do not need guide dogs or canes, but they can run around the classroom, walk up and down the stairs, and stroll around the 54-acre campus. On weekends, they pack their suitcases and go home for the holidays.</p>
<p>This school, founded in 1829, is the first school for the blind in the United States. Its goal is to enable people with disabilities to have the opportunity to contribute their abilities to society. Many of its graduates are well-known figures in society, writers, and musicians.</p>
<p>Perkins is a happy paradise. For 117 years, its education has been very rigorous. The school understands each student's personality and talents and teachers teach according to their individual traits. Exceptional sensitivity of touch and hearing is not innate to blind children; it also requires long-term, patient training.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the semester, you might encounter a student walking between two houses, suddenly stopping, clapping his hands, and then walking forward. Relying on the echo of the clap, he can tell how far he has walked from the house. But after a few days, even this is no longer necessary.</p>
<p>A hundred years ago, Perkins abandoned the erroneous idea that "the blind cannot see, so everything can be sloppy" and built magnificent school buildings, towers, and flower gardens just like other normal schools. Inside are flowers, trees, ponds, and paths, its beauty simply like a paradise on earth. The beautiful classrooms have corridors, so the children do not have to fear rain clouds.</p>
<h3>Lawn Tennis Tournament Scheduled to Begin on the 9th, Men's Singles and Doubles Order Drawn, Few Female Participants</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The city's first lawn tennis tournament, the men's singles, is scheduled to begin on the 9th of this month. Senior and junior singles will start at the same time. The doubles tournament is scheduled to start on August 26th. Due to the few number of applicants for the women's tournament and mixed doubles, the registration period has been extended to the 6th.</p>
<p>Important Resolutions</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 5:00 PM, the association held its eighth meeting with Zhao Minheng and others. Many important resolutions were passed, and the order of all matches was also determined. The resolutions are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Draw lots to determine the order of all matches. (2) Starting dates for each group: Men's Senior Singles, August 9th; Men's Doubles, August 26th; Men's Junior Singles, August 9th. (3) The official match ball will include "Ladisson". (4) Due to the small number of participants for the women's singles and mixed doubles, the registration period has been extended to the 6th, starting today. (5) Prizes will be donated by enthusiastic sports enthusiasts from all walks of life.</p>
<p>Strength Analysis</p>
<p>There are ten participants in the men's senior singles. Tao Guanqiu, Kola Sakhson, and Wang Wenzheng are the strongest. The semi-finals will likely be these four. In the second week, Kola Sakhson will meet the winner of the match between Zhou Guanjun and Xie Zhaoliang. It is uncertain whether Zhou Guanjun can defeat Kola Sakhson. It is a pity that Li Guofan will meet Carson in the first week and may lose.</p>
<p>There are a total of ten pairs participating in the men's doubles. The strongest four groups are Carson/Sakhson, Yu Tianguang/Peng Naweiqu, Wang Wenzheng/Tao Guanqiu, and Li Guofan/Cai Guoji. The semi-finals will likely be these four groups. However, Yu Tianguang/Peng Naweiqu will face Xie Zhaoliang/Xu Chengwei in the second week, and Li Guofan/Cai Guoji will face Zhou Guanjun/Li Leishi in the first week, so there may be intense competition. There are twenty-eight participants in the men's junior singles, and the situation is difficult to predict. The drawn order is recorded below:</p>

<p>Civil Affairs Briefs</p>
<h3>Administrative Matters Related to Rites and Customs in This City to Be Handled by the Social Affairs Bureau</h3>
<p>Administrative matters related to rites and customs in this city were originally handled by the Social Affairs Bureau. Later, because these matters fell within the scope of civil affairs, they were transferred to the Civil Affairs Office. Recently, the city government determined that the Civil Affairs Office was limited by its personnel structure and would be adding preferential treatment for military service and other matters, making it difficult to handle all the administrative matters related to rites and customs. Yesterday, the relevant bureaus and offices were ordered to return the handling of these matters to the Social Affairs Bureau.</p>
<h3>Representatives of the Second District Request Land for Building District Headquarters</h3>
<p>The People's Representatives Conference of the Second District of this city resolved at its first meeting to build the conference headquarters and the district office. Six representatives, including Liu Xiexun, Wang Yangzhen, and He Huide, were selected to form a delegation to request land allocation from the mayor. Yesterday (the 1st) at 10:00 AM, the district chief, Li Ruchun, accompanied them to the city government to meet with the mayor. After the representatives stated their reasons and methods, Mayor Wu expressed his approval and promised to instruct the relevant bureaus and offices to investigate and allocate land. He was also pleased with the representatives' enthusiasm for local self-government and encouraged them to make the district a model district in the city. Finally, he gave instructions on the future direction of district security work. The representatives, satisfied with the results, left with pleasure.</p>
<h3>Twenty-Third District to Repair Wharf</h3>
<p>Wusong Town in the jurisdiction of the Twenty-Third District is a major port on the Shanghai sea route, with thriving commerce and numerous sails. Since the August 13th Incident, the wharves along the river have been destroyed by violent enemies, causing great inconvenience for loading and unloading goods. Recognizing this, the district office launched an initiative to raise funds from local gentry and merchants, factories, stores, and shareholders to repair the more important Chuangsheng Lou Wharf on Wai Ma Road first. Currently, the labor and materials are being estimated, and construction will begin soon.</p>
<p>In other news, the Twenty-Third District (Wusong) distributed relief flour to impoverished households on May 31st, totaling 378 bags. There was a surplus of 68 bags, which was entrusted to the district office for distribution. As of July 28th, the distribution has been completed.</p>
<h3>Questions and Answers on Household Registration Regulations (Continued)</h3>
<p>(14) Question: If someone has not attended private school or received formal education but can read, how should their education level be recorded?</p>
<p>Answer: Their literacy level can be listed as "Private 1" or "Private 2," etc., depending on their degree of literacy.</p>
<p>(15) Question: How should barbers who operate shops and those who operate as peddlers be classified?</p>
<p>Answer: Those who make a living by barbering, whether they operate shops or are mobile, can be classified as "Other Occupations."</p>
<p>(16) Question: Are bank employees considered commercial or public service?</p>
<p>Answer: Employees of national banks can be listed as "Public Service"; employees of other local or private banks can be listed as "Commercial."</p>
<p>(17) Question: Should monks and Taoists who solicit alms and chant scriptures be classified as religious practitioners or unemployed?</p>
<p>Answer: If monks and Taoists make a living by soliciting alms, the income they receive is considered a gift rather than compensation. They are considered "Unemployed," like beggars who go door to door. If they receive compensation for chanting scriptures, they are considered religious practitioners and should be listed as "Freelance." If they receive compensation for chanting scriptures and also solicit alms, they should be classified according to the part of their income that comes from compensation and listed as "Freelance."</p>
<h3>District Briefs</h3>
<p>The Twenty-Second District Office convened a meeting of the twelve bao chiefs and cadre members under its jurisdiction yesterday (the 1st) at 3:00 PM.

<h3>Civil Affairs Bureau Answers Changhong Jun</h3>
<p>Regarding Changhong Jun's "Suggestions to the Civil Affairs Bureau" in the first issue of the Speaking Half-Monthly, according to the responsible personnel of the Civil Affairs Bureau, Changhong Jun's care for the city's Baojia system and the suggestions made to this Bureau are deeply admired. However, many of the issues raised do not conform to the facts. Here is a separate explanation to clear up the misunderstandings.</p>
<p>(1) The purpose of the identity card is to facilitate the cardholder in proving their identity at any time. Therefore, the card must contain detailed factual information. If it is oversimplified, it will still be necessary to go to the Municipal Government Police Bureau and the District Office to consult the household registration survey forms, rendering the identity card completely ineffective.</p>
<p>(2) The "Age" column in the newly printed application form is not an omission, but is formulated in accordance with the table format promulgated by the Central Government. As for why the central form does not include age, it is because age must increase every year. What is filled in this year must be calculated next year. Therefore, the date of birth is used instead, as the date of birth is permanently unchanged, which can reduce age errors.</p>
<p>(3) If there are three people in a household who come from three different places, we cannot be negligent. These three people definitely did not arrive at the same time. If they arrived at different times, they should fill out the application forms separately, one after the other, which is not a problem at all. If, by chance, these two people arrived at the same time, they can fill out one application form together. If the columns for "Where do you come from" and "Original address" are not enough to fill in, they can be noted in the remarks column.</p>
<p>(4) If a tenant has left without reporting their departure, the Baojia head should urge them to report. If the door is locked, it still implies an intention to return. The reporting can be urged upon their return. Furthermore, if the entire family leaves without saying goodbye, it is close to absconding. How can the Baojia head know this immediately? It is truly unjust to blame the Baojia head. However, the Baojia head also has the responsibility to investigate and report absconding households.</p>
<p>As for the rest of Changhong Jun's pointing out that the forms are too complicated, they are actually all based on those promulgated by the Central Government. Moreover, this type of form has been implemented in various provinces, counties, and townships during wartime and has been effective. Shanghai's cultural level should not be lower than that of various provinces, counties, and townships, so there is no need to worry too much.

<h3>Return of Goods Held by Lun Chang Warehouse - Distribution Method Agreed Upon - Initially Returning 20,000 Bolts Out of the Total of 120,000 Bolts</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] The British-owned Lun Chang Textile Dyeing Factory produced Real Linen and various printed fabrics, which were widely sold before the war. During the war, it was occupied by the enemy Japanese, and the inventory was plundered. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the British merchant began to recover. However, the warehouse receipts for the fabrics produced before the war had not been processed, and the receipt holders had considerable difficulties. Subsequently, the Cotton Cloth Association learned that among the materials left by the enemy Japanese in various warehouses, there were still some Lun Chang goods. It then reported to the Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Office for cleaning and return. However, these remaining fabrics were from the Puppet Merchant Association's storage. It was claimed that they were obtained by the enemy puppets from merchants and not directly taken from Lun Chang, so they were not returned. The association first negotiated with the Lun Chang authorities for the return of the Lun Chang portion. The factory also argued that the factory's own fabrics had been plundered and proposed that the remaining portion should be distributed on a pro rata basis. The association requested that the interests of the customers be taken into account first. After several consultations, a preliminary agreement was recently reached. Yesterday (the 2nd) at 4 pm, the association convened a meeting of receipt holders to discuss the distribution method. It is said that Chinese holders of the factory's warehouse receipts total 2,905, amounting to approximately 120,000 bolts. 2,500 of these receipts have been registered with the association. The factory had promised to allocate 17,000 bolts from the remaining portion first, and then added another 20,000 bolts. The remainder will be processed after receiving compensation from the enemy Japanese. At yesterday's association meeting, the receipt holders expressed their agreement in principle. It is heard that the association is still waiting for the receipt holders to complete the entrustment procedures before it can formally establish an agreement with Lun Chang. According to the person in charge of Lun Chang Factory, a joint announcement will have to be made with the association in the future to ensure credibility. The association revealed that Lun Chang originally produced about thirty types of colors. Today's leftovers are only five or six types, and they are mostly goods of secondary quality. The types listed on the warehouse receipts are different. In the future, unless they are distributed jointly, there is no way to solve the problem. The participants stated that the types of goods are different, but they can be evaluated separately to find the total number so that they can be distributed fairly. Therefore, the holders of receipts for certain goods may receive other goods, but the association will strive for fairness. Relevant parties hope to organize a committee to handle this matter. Most receipt holders also hope to resolve the matter quickly so they can be helped. Yesterday's receipt holder meeting was conducted in accordance with this principle. The main points of the resolution are recorded as follows. (1) Lun Chang will allocate 20,000 bolts to the receipt holders in the city. (2) The amount of distribution to each household shall be handled in proportion to the appraised value of its inventory. (3) Organize an evaluation, distribution, accounting, storage and other committees. (4) After the receipt holders complete the entrustment procedures, sign a contract with Lun Chang and report to the competent authority.</p>

<h3>Javanese Tea Production Drops Sharply</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Java, 2nd] Java tea production reached 62,000 tons in 1940, but dropped to 1,700 tons last year. One reason is that due to food shortages, tea gardens were converted to food crops, and the second is due to the neglect during the Japanese occupation, which only focused on the planting of war materials. The Dutch East Indies government is now working hard to decide to restore production and is expected to reach 20% of pre-war production in a year.</p>

<h3>Agricultural Loan - There are Seven Types of Target - The Term is Mostly Within One Year - The Lowest Monthly Interest is Only Two Points</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] A reporter recently visited the Shanghai branch of the China Farmers Bank to inquire about the bank's handling of agricultural loans. It was told that the Shanghai branch handles agricultural loans, which are divided into seven types according to the nature of agriculture: production, transportation and sales, warehouse, promotion, sideline, water conservancy, and emergency loans. The loan target is mainly agricultural associations and cooperatives. In addition, institutions such as public agricultural promotion and improvement, and privately established farms are also given loans. The loan term, in terms of ordinary production loans, is mostly within one year. In addition, loans such as water conservancy have a relatively long period, but the maximum principle is not more than three years. At present, agricultural loans are mostly focused on production loans. The Shanghai branch's loan range includes 21 counties. However, due to traffic obstacles, only 16 counties in Jiangnan are actually handling agricultural loans. Among them, silkworm loans in Suzhou, Wuxi, Changshu, and Wujiang areas; cotton loans in Taicang, Jiading, and Kunshan areas; occupy a significant amount. The highest monthly interest rate for ordinary agricultural loans is generally not more than four percent. As for emergency loans with a relief nature, the monthly interest rate is only two percent. Since the Shanghai branch started handling agricultural loans in early March this year, it has loaned a total of 2 billion yuan. Among them, agricultural loans in the production field account for more than half.</p>
<h3>North China Carpet Industry in Crisis - Workers Demand Improved Treatment - Costs Will Increase With Higher Wages</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Tianjin, 2nd] The carpet manufacturing industry, which was originally one of the main export industries in North China, is now facing a crisis of collapse. Weavers are mostly on strike and have made demands for improved treatment. If these demands are accepted, the production cost of carpets will be higher than the selling price in the United States, which is the most important Chinese carpet market in the past. Before the war, it was considered one of China's best export goods, with about 5,000 machines and 20,000 to 25,000 workers. The output of North China averaged 1,000,000 square feet per month, worth US$80,000 to US$100,000.</p>
<h3>Exchange of Materials Between Guannei and Guanwai to Occur Soon</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Tianjin, 2nd] Economic communication between Dongbei and Guannei is about to come to fruition. There is panic over cotton cloth in Northeast China, and there is a lack of food in Guannei, so there is a need for mutual assistance. It is reported that the Northeast Economic Committee has decided to set up a Materials Adjustment Committee, dividing it into four committees: grain, coal, groceries, and fabrics, to preside over the exchange of materials. The price of miscellaneous grains in Tianjin is about twice as high as in the Northeast. If large-scale transportation is possible, it will be very beneficial to the livelihood of the people in Tianjin and Pingjin.</p>
<h3>Coal Prices Fall Back</h3>
<p>The coal market's white coal block heard that the Shanghai Coal Business United Business Office has applied to the Ministry of Economic Affairs' Fuel Management Committee for several hundred tons of Yangquan block coal, and its distribution price is only 200,000 yuan per ton (the redistribution price for coal merchants is 330,000 yuan), so holders are cautious and plan to sell at high prices. Therefore, the market price has fallen back slightly. The opening medicine train screened blocks of bituminous coal are also distributed, and the distribution price for shareholders of the United Business Office is 210,000 yuan, so the current market price of Kaiping bituminous coal blocks has also fallen.</p>
<h3>Raw Sugar Selling Price Tightens</h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market was still tight due to the lack of spot goods. The association opened a Shantou gang to offer a price of 91,000 yuan to 90,000 yuan, up 1,200 yuan, and sold hundreds of packages. The Xinghua gang opened Shanggong fenbai at 135,000 yuan, medium grade at 125,670 yuan, Xingchi at 115,670 yuan, second grade at 114,000 yuan, for a total of more than two hundred bundles. The Jian bang Diao Qing called for a rise of 2,300 yuan, but no deal was made. The cost of Chinese sand white, such as Xiamen and Wenzhou goods, is high, so the opening price cannot be as low as the Taiwan company's, and it must be about 30,000 yuan above the limited price.</p>
<h3>Canadian Gold Price - Government Will Not Allow Increase</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Ottawa, 2nd] The recent adjustment of the exchange rate of the Canadian dollar has reduced the price of gold from US$38.50 per ounce to US$25. Canadian yu miners have now obtained some concessions from the government, but it is still difficult to succeed in seeking to increase the price. The United States and Britain have reiterated their determination not to increase the price, and South American countries have recently dumped it in large quantities. Under such circumstances, the hopes of Canadian gold miners have been completely dashed. According to South American free markets, the price of gold is as high as US$40 per ounce, and even more so in India, the Middle East, and Shanghai. Therefore, Canadian gold merchants also requested to increase the price of gold and sell it to foreign countries. Canada's gold production reaches as much as 3,000,000 ounces per year, so if it is sold freely, it will greatly affect the world gold market.</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn and Cloth Shipped to Guangdong in Large Quantities</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] The China Merchants Bureau's Haiwan ship exported cotton yarn 2,200 pieces, and piece goods 2,020 pieces yesterday, of which 138 pieces were reported by the China Textile Corporation. There were also 850 pieces of Bunemmon caustic soda, 800 pieces of medicinal materials, and more than 500 pieces of miscellaneous goods, which were transported to Guangdong. A few days ago, the Jianghe ship sailed to Chongqing, carrying 1,000 pieces of cotton, about 800 pieces of cotton cloth. The cotton was shipped to Chongqing by Shenxin Yarn Factory, and the cotton cloth was shipped by China Textile Corporation. There were also dozens of boxes of machinery, which were wool weaving machines from Chongqing China Wool Weaving Company.</p>
<h3>700 Dan Distributed Daily - 73,000 Each Dan - Oil Shortage Will Not Occur - If Electricity Can Be Fully Supplied - One Factory's Production Can Supply the Whole City</h3>
<p>(Our newspaper report) Li Tingdong, director of the China Vegetable Oil Factory, recently told our reporter: The supply of edible oil in the city is unlikely to be a problem. He is also optimistic about the future of Shantou prices. According to the factory's current production volume, it is more than enough to supply half of the city's actual sales. If the Public Utilities Bureau can restore the normal power supply to the factory, then the factory can fully meet the city's demand for edible oil. It is estimated that the city consumes more than 1,000 dan of edible oil per day, and the factory directly distributes 700 dan to various retail stores every day. The factory's distribution of edible oil was initially entrusted by the Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau to accept the application of retail stores in the city for direct distribution. According to the factory's investigation, there are 600 qualified stores. They are divided into three groups: A, B, and C, with 200 stores in each group, so they are distributed in rotation every day. Yesterday, 200 retail stores in Group C were distributed, each store with one barrel of soybean oil. Weighing 30 and a half dan. The distribution price per dan is 73,000 yuan, including freight. The profit of each store's door price is stipulated at a maximum of 10%, so it is estimated to be about 810 yuan per catty. The factory has now decided to continue direct distribution every day, without interruption, in order to suppress the price of oil. In addition, the factory recently shipped 1,000 dan of raw oil from Qingdao, and the China Edible Oil Company also shipped 7,000 dan, so there is no shortage of edible oil in the city.</p>

<h3>The Li Wen Case Under Investigation</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Zhang Shengli, Kunming Aviation News, 29th of this month</p>
<p>The two cases of Li Wen's assassination occurred within five days. More than half a month has passed since then, and the case has not been fully revealed. There are various rumors in various places, and there are many rumors in Kunming. No matter where the "rumors" come from or what the "propaganda" effect is, before the entire case is announced, the average person cannot draw "of course" conclusions. Based on personal observations in Kunming and the responses of various parties to this case, the reporter's comprehensive report is as follows:</p>
<h3>The Assassination of Li Gongpu</h3>
<p>The assassination of Li Gongpu occurred on the evening of July 11th. The sudden, bloody incident was not reported in detail by any Kunming newspapers on the 12th. Even the "People's Wall Newspaper," generally considered left-leaning, only issued a brief emergency extra the following morning, reporting Mr. Li's death. Fourteen periodicals, including the Democratic Weekly (organ of the Democratic League), published the second issue of a joint supplement on the 15th, carrying "The Assassination of Mr. Li Gongpu" (author unnamed), which stated: "On the evening of the 11th, at around 7 p.m., Mr. Li Gongpu and his wife, Ms. Zhang Manjun, went out separately for different reasons. After finishing their business at around 8 p.m., they went together to the Kunming Grand Theatre to watch a movie. After the movie ended at 10 p.m., they took a public bus on Nanping Street back to their residence on Beimen Street. They got off at the Qingyun Street station. As they walked into the alley connecting Qingyun Street to Daxing Street, they suddenly heard a gunshot from behind. Mrs. Li initially thought it was a tire blowout, but then saw Mr. Li shot and falling to the ground, groaning in the mud. Mrs. Li urgently shouted, 'Catch him! Someone's been shot!' Few people were on the street in the rain, and no one came."</p>
<h3>The Sound of a Gunshot</h3>
<p>Another article in the joint supplement, titled "From Jinri Building to Qingyun Street," seemed to describe the situation from the perspective of an eyewitness. It stated: "Mr. Li Gongpu and his wife were sitting on the side seats in the middle of the bus. Mr. Li was wearing a raincoat, and Mrs. Li was wearing a cheongsam covered with a jacket and a white scarf around her head. On either side of them sat a young man in yellow military uniform, one of whom had his hair partially covering his right eye. Diagonally across from them sat a fashionable woman, and next to her sat another young man in yellow military uniform. In addition, there were several other people in yellow uniforms on the bus, and the rest were ordinary people. When the bus stopped at Qingyun Street station, several ordinary people got off first, followed by Mr. and Mrs. Li Gongpu. Immediately following them was the young man in yellow uniform sitting diagonally across from the fashionable woman, followed by three ordinary people, and then the two young men in yellow uniform who were sitting next to them." "I did not get off here, of course, and remained on the bus. Suddenly, I heard a 'gunshot,' and people became chaotic. I then rushed to get off the bus with everyone else to see what happened. I saw the two young men in yellow uniforms who had gotten off last shouting, 'Got him! Got him!' in a Yunnan accent. Someone shone a flashlight and saw that the person who had been shot was Mr. Li... At this time, the voices were noisy, and the fashionable woman shouted, 'The assassin is the one sitting next to me!' When I suddenly remembered, the assassin had already fled to the west end of Qingyun Street, and the two who shouted 'Got him!' were also gone. Mrs. Li also chased after them. I then joined everyone in chasing after them with all my strength, until we reached the gate of the Third Police Precinct, where we saw the assassin in yellow uniform being stopped by the police on the side of the street, raising both hands and saying, 'It wasn't me, it wasn't me,' also in a Yunnan accent, of medium build. He was then taken into the station. Soon after, an old woman with bound feet came to the police officer and said, 'He bought something from me and owes me fifty yuan, and then ran away.' Her intention was to make the police let him go lightly."</p>
<p>According to the record in the joint supplement, there seemed to be three culprits, all wearing yellow uniforms and speaking with a Yunnan accent. The gunshot sounded like a "tire blowout." It is evident that it was not a suppressed pistol.</p>
<h3>Kunming Security Authorities' Statement on the Li Case</h3>
<p>On the 13th, Kunming newspapers published a statement by the security authorities on the Li case, stating that "Mayor Zeng, upon receiving the report late that night (the evening of the 11th) kept watch at the city hall overnight, urging the police bureau and all branch bureaus and district offices to apprehend the culprit as soon as possible, and instructed Director Gong (Chief of Police) to lead officers to the scene of the incident for investigation, and to notify the court for inspection. It is reported that the city government attaches great importance to the assassination of Mr. Li Gongpu. In addition to handing over a suspect arrested at the scene to the Garrison Headquarters for interrogation, it has immediately reported to the Provincial Government and the Garrison Headquarters for their review, and has now sent additional officers to investigate." (Yunnan News Agency)</p>
<p>Chief Gong of the Police Bureau also stated: "The night before last (the 11th), at about 10 p.m., Mr. Li Gongpu was shot by thugs at the foot of the slope on Qingyun Street, Daxing Street. The Third Police Precinct rushed to the scene upon hearing the gunfire and took a suspect named Li Chengye into custody. During a brief interrogation, he confessed: 'I am from Sichuan and work as a mechanical sergeant at the Tenth Repair Factory of the Aviation Commission. I took a public bus from Mashikou to visit a friend surnamed Chen in Dameiyuan Lane. As soon as I got off the bus, I suddenly heard gunshots. To avoid danger, I ran away in a panic, which led to my arrest by the police.' Officers from the Third Precinct searched the suspect and found 30,000 yuan in legal tender and a small knife, but no other weapons, and immediately sent him to the Garrison Headquarters for interrogation... Commander-in-Chief Huo attaches great importance to this case. In addition to turning the suspect Li Chengye over to the Military Law Office for strict interrogation, he has also strictly ordered his subordinates to apprehend the culprit within a time limit and bring him to justice in order to maintain public order." (Reported in the newspapers of the 13th)</p>
<p>Li Chengye's initial statement differs greatly from the account recorded in the joint supplement. The reporter cannot judge which is true.</p>
<h3>Yunnan Branch of the Democratic League Protests the Li Case</h3>
<p>The Yunnan Branch of the Democratic League submitted a protest to the government on the 12th: (1) Thoroughly investigate the person directly responsible for this case and the murderer, and punish them severely. (2) Provide generous compensation to the family of the deceased. (3) Immediately fulfill the four promises, abolish the special agent organizations, protect human rights, and guarantee that similar incidents will not happen again in the future. (Reported in the joint supplement of July 15th)</p>
<h3>Street Posters and Leaflets</h3>
<p>After the Li case occurred, there were many posters and leaflets near the National Southwestern Associated University and Yunnan University. The most notable were of two types: one signed by the Kunming Student Union or a certain wall newspaper, declaring "Mr. Li Gongpu was killed by the Kuomintang special agents." The other was signed by the "Yinnan Anti-Communist Great Alliance," stating: "The Communist Party killed Li Gongpu." "Ai Siqi killed Li Gongpu." In addition, there also appeared a "Notice from the Yunnan Branch of the Chinese Communist Party": "It has been found that Li Gongpu's recent words and actions have been absurd and violate the party's program in many ways. This branch has received a secret order from Chairman Mao of Yan'an to execute Li Gongpu. Li Gongpu did not abide by party discipline and disobeyed orders, so his death is well-deserved. (Rest omitted)"</p>
<h3>Yunnan Provincial Garrison Headquarters Clarifies Its Position</h3>
<p>The spokesperson of the Yunnan Provincial Garrison Headquarters issued a statement on the 13th, saying: "(Previous text omitted) This Headquarters is responsible for maintaining public order and should do its best to apprehend the culprit and bring him to justice in order to comfort the deceased's spirit. However, some people have recently been recklessly slandering this Headquarters, attempting to shift the blame, and are afraid that the world will not be in chaos, which is extremely regrettable. This Headquarters' responsibility is in public order, and it does not interfere in any issues outside of public order. Therefore, in addition to stepping up orders to subordinates to apprehend the culprit and strive to solve the case, it also hopes that people in society will provide more assistance." (Central News Agency)</p>
<h3>Two Official Letters</h3>
<p>On the same day (the 13th), the Garrison Headquarters sent a letter to the Yunnan Branch of the Democratic League, which stated: "(Previous text omitted) Today (the 13th), it was reported that posters and wall newspapers posted on the streets, some signed by the Student Union and some signed by the Student Self-Government Association, contained accusations against this Headquarters regarding the record of Mr. Li Gongpu's murder. This concerns defamation of the reputation of a public office, and there are clear provisions for punishment in the law. Whether these posters and wall newspapers are related to your League, or are instigated by your League, should be noted, and a clear reply is hoped for." (Central News Agency)</p>
<p>After receiving the letter, the Yunnan Branch of the Democratic League replied to the Garrison Headquarters the following day, stating: "(Previous text omitted) Our League has its own political stance and respect for the rule of law. The posters and wall newspapers seen by your department have named organizations. Whether they were posted by those organizations is unknown, but it is extremely obvious that they are unrelated to our League. Your department's claim that it seems to be instigated by our League should be corrected responsibly to clarify the situation. However, our League cannot help but say that the death of Mr. Li Gongpu has aroused public outrage. Young students in particular cannot avoid being emotional. Your department is responsible for public order, and it is hoped that you will handle the situation calmly to meet the public's desire for good governance. This is our reply." (Published in Observation, Justice, Yunnan, and other newspapers of the 15th)</p>
<h3>Two Reports</h3>
<p>At 1 p.m. on the 15th, the Li Gongpu Funeral Committee held a general meeting in the Zhigong Hall of Yunnan University. According to a student newspaper report, more than 1,000 people attended. After the chairman's speech, Mrs. Zhang Manjun, Mr. Li Gongpu's wife, gave a report, stating: "Before his death, he knew he would die. When he went out, he said to me: 'I don't know if I can come back after stepping out of this door today.' So, he had this premonition! He asked me: 'What will you do if I die?' Although I didn't say it, I had already planned it in my heart - I decided to continue to fight with him... He was my good husband, my good friend. (Sobbing)" After Mrs. Zhang's report, Mr. Wen Yiduo gave a speech. Mr. Wen began by saying: "In the past few days, everyone knows that the most despicable and shameless thing in history has appeared in Kunming! What crime did Mr. Li commit that he suffered such a cruel hand? ... What is this? Are there any special agents here today? Stand up, if you're a hero, stand up! Come out and tell us: Why was Mr. Li killed? (Loud voice, warm applause) After killing someone, you still slander them, saying 'love affair,' saying 'Communist Party killed the Communist Party!' (Warm applause) He concluded: "We must be prepared like Mr. Li, to step out of the door with our front foot and not be prepared to step back in with our back foot!" (Reported in the Student Newspaper on the 21st, which was edited and published by the Kunming Student Union)</p>
<p>At 3 p.m. on the 15th, the person in charge of the Yunnan Branch of the Democratic League hosted reporters from various newspapers at the Democratic Weekly office on Fuyong Road, with more than ten people attending. First, Chu Tunan reported, stating that today's invitation to reporters was not intended to raise any questions or answer any questions. Today, only the details of Mr. Li's murder and his life will be reported. After the report, a reporter asked: Recently, wall newspapers and posters posted on the streets have claimed that this case was instigated by the Yunnan Provincial Garrison Headquarters. What is the opinion of your branch on this? Chu Tunan replied: These wall newspapers have nothing to do with our branch. We have stated this point in our reply to the Headquarters. He also asked: What hopes does your branch have for the local authorities? Answer: It is hoped that the security authorities will handle the situation calmly, apprehend the culprit, solve the case, and resolve it according to the law. Another reporter asked: Street posters have said that Mr. Li was assassinated by communists, and others have said that he was assassinated by Kuomintang special agents. Is your branch aware of this? Answer: Unknown. He also asked: Some say this was a crime of passion? Wen Yiduo replied: This is slander. The person is already dead, and it is wrong to slander him further. Mr. Wen's attitude at the press conference was calm, and he spoke very little, repeatedly inviting reporters to have tea and snacks. His newly renovated face occasionally showed a slight smile. The reception ended at 5 p.m. Mr. Wen sent the reporters to the door, shaking hands with them one by one to say goodbye. Half an hour later, Mr. Wen was suddenly assassinated and killed!</p>
<h3>The Assassination of Wen Yiduo</h3>
<p>On the 16th, Kunming newspapers published two news items. One was news from the Kunming Police Bureau, announcing the details of Mr. Wen's murder as follows:</p>
<p>"Yesterday (the 15th) at 5:30 p.m., Wen Yiduo, a professor at the National Southwestern Associated University, and his son Wen Yihe (reporter's note: this is a mistake for Wen Lihe) were walking north from No. 14 Fuyong Road, the Democratic Weekly office, when they were suddenly shot by two thugs, one wearing a blue outfit and one wearing a grey outfit. Mr. Wen and his son immediately fell to the ground. The police on duty heard the sound and chased after them but failed to catch them. At the scene of the incident, they found one large Lahti cartridge and three Mauser pistol cartridges. The wounded Mr. Wen and his son were sent to the hospital for treatment. Wen Yiduo died on the way to the hospital from multiple gunshot wounds to the abdomen. His son was shot five times, one leg was broken, and he was unable to speak. The Chief of the Municipal Police Bureau rushed to the scene of the incident upon hearing the news to investigate, and dispatched additional officers to pursue and arrest the culprits, and reported to the Provincial and Municipal Government and the Garrison Headquarters to strictly arrest and bring them to justice."</p>
<h3>Reward for the Arrest of the Culprit</h3>
<p>Another message was the Garrison Headquarters' notice offering a reward for the arrest of the culprit: "It has been found that some reactionary elements, harboring ulterior motives, are attempting to disrupt social order, create incidents, and engage in conspiracies. This Headquarters is responsible for maintaining local order, and in order to solve the case quickly, it is offering a reward for the arrest of the culprit. Anyone who can capture the culprit and hand them over to the Headquarters for legal action will be rewarded with one million yuan in legal tender. Anyone who can report information that leads to the arrest will be rewarded with five hundred thousand yuan in legal tender, to be issued on the day the case is solved." The Peace Daily reported on the 16th that the Yunnan Provincial Government also offered a reward of 500,000 yuan for the arrest of the culprit.</p>
<p>The Student Newspaper, published on the 21st, carried an article titled "The Assassination of Mr. Wen Yiduo," which stated: "According to nearby residents: there were no less than five assassins. They had been lurking near the National Southwestern Associated University faculty dormitory for a long time. Several were hiding in the gate of a nearby rice warehouse. When Mr. Wen and his son passed by, the assassins surrounded them from the front and back and concentrated their fire. They only boarded a jeep and fled towards Qianju Street after seeing Mr. Wen and his son lying in a pool of blood."</p>
<p>The newspaper also carried "An Interview with Mr. Wen's Family," in which Miss Wen (13 or 14 years old) said: "That day, my father was hosting news reporters at No. 14 Fuyong Road. At around 4 o'clock, my older brother (referring to Lihe) came from home to pick up my father." On the way, he saw three "special agents" wandering along the street. My older brother told my father about the situation, and they waited for a while. After a while, my older brother came out to check again and saw that there was no one on the street, so he went home with my father. When they were about 20 steps away from home (i.e., the National Southwestern Associated University faculty dormitory), they saw two or three burly men in blue Zhongshan suits coming from Qianju Street, and at the same time, two or three guys in blue outfits came from behind. Soon, the gun went off. The first shot hit my father's head, and my father immediately fell to the ground. My older brother quickly grabbed my father. At this time, several "special agents" fired several shots at my older brother. After being hit, my older brother still got up and tried to run home to report the news, but he was shot again at this time. My older brother saw my father lying on the ground, bleeding non-stop, foaming at the mouth, so he turned back to my father's side. The "special agents" fired four or five more shots at my father. After the shooting, those "special agents" ran in both directions."</p>
<h3>Democratic League Figures Request Protection from the US Consulate</h3>
<p>After the Wen case occurred, Democratic League figures Pan Guangdan, Fei Xiaotong, Chu Tunan, and others, upon hearing the news, telegraphed the US Consul General in Yunnan from Yunnan University, requesting temporary protection. The acting Consul General, McCarley, went to the Yunnan Provincial Garrison Headquarters at 7 p.m. that day (the 15th) to explain the matter. It is reported that McCarley said: Since the assassinations of Li Gongpu and Wen Yiduo, there have been many rumors and concerns about public order. Several Chinese people have come to the consulate to reside and request protection for safety reasons, and they have been accommodated. On the 17th, the Garrison Headquarters sent a memorandum to McCarley, the content of which was said to be as follows: "After this case occurred, this Headquarters is making every effort to offer rewards for the arrest of the culprit and bring him to justice. It is this Headquarters' unshirkable responsibility to protect the people and maintain public order. Your office should have no need to provide protection. Our two countries have extremely friendly relations, and have fought side by side, and with the signing of the new Sino-US equal treaty, Sino-US relations have become even closer. Your office's protection of the people of a sovereign state in the capacity of a consul violates the spirit of the new Sino-US equal treaty. This Headquarters deeply regrets this measure taken by your office. We hereby declare to the Consul General that, based on the above reasons, the protected persons should be handed over to this Headquarters for legal protection." A few days later, it was heard that Pan Guangdan had voluntarily left the US Consulate and was residing in the Tsinghua Office. On the evening of the 21st, Principal Mei Yiqi's chauffeur, driving an empty car, was returning from outside when he was stopped by plainclothes officers who asked how many people lived in Mei's house. Pan heard the news and felt uneasy, and returned to the US Consulate. In recent days, it has been heard that Democratic League figures have left the consulate, and security agencies have sent troops to protect their residences.</p>
<h3>An Interlude</h3>
<p>During the period of the Li and Wen cases, there was an interlude. A middle-aged widow, named Zhang Jingzhen, in her forties, from western Yunnan Province, had no fixed address in Kunming and often stayed in hotels. She had a good foundation in old literature, could recite the entire Bible, and could read characters and tell fortunes. Before and after the Li and Wen cases, this woman, who seemed crazy but wasn't, told fortunes and spread rumors at the National Southwestern Associated University and Yunnan University. She said that the character "duo" in Wen Yiduo's name, when broken down, is 夕上加一, which is a 歹 character, meaning a bad person. She said he was a bad person and would die at night. She also told the fortune of Yunnan University President Xiong, saying: the character Xiong comes from water, which is beneficial to the north and not beneficial to the south. Some people rumored that Xiong left Kunming early, possibly influenced by this. The Kunming Gendarmerie Regiment, upon hearing this information, arrested and interrogated the widow, but found nothing.</p>
<h3>The Attitude of the National Southwestern Associated University Standing Committee towards the Wen Case</h3>
<p>After the Wen case occurred, the National Southwestern Associated University Standing Committee appointed five people, including Director of Student Affairs Zha Liangzhao, Dean Huang Yusheng, and Director of General Affairs Shen Lu, to organize the Wen Yiduo Funeral and Compensation Committee. On the 21st, Kunming newspapers published a statement by the committee's spokesperson, stating: "Mr. Wen Yiduo, a professor in the Department of Chinese Literature at this university, unfortunately died in an ambush. The teachers and students of this university are deeply saddened... It has been decided that a memorial service will be held at the Kunming North Classroom at 3 p.m. on the 24th of this month, expressing the grief of the teachers and students from the university's perspective. If other organizations take action, it has nothing to do with this committee or this university, and this committee will not merge with any other organization to take action. The funeral expenses of Mr. Wen and the medical expenses of Mrs. Wen and Mr. Wen's son will be covered by this university, and there is no need to solicit donations from outside. As for compensation, no donations will be solicited until the method is determined."</p>
<h3>The Emergence of New Groups</h3>
<p>After the Li and Wen cases occurred, several new groups suddenly appeared in Kunming, including the "Kunming Li Gongpu and Wen Yiduo Two Gentlemen Blood Case Support Association." The association published a "Letter to the American Committee for Peace Union," a "Sorrowful Appeal to All the Elders of Yunnan," and a letter "To Marshall and Stuart Leiden" in the Student Newspaper on the 21st. There was also the "Yunnan Qingliu National Studies Society," which also distributed leaflets "Appealing to the Compatriots of the Whole Country for the Li and Wen Tragedies." There was also a "Yunnan People's Justice Society," which telegraphed Chairman Chiang to punish the perpetrators.</p>
<h3>Several Rumors Spread</h3>
<p>After Yan Xiaopeng, Secretary-General of the Ministry of National Defense, arrived in Kunming from Nanjing on the 18th, some rumors began to circulate in Kunming on the 19th. Rumor has it that the Yunnan Provincial Garrison Headquarters had uncovered several secret organizations, including a ×× Party and three special agent organizations. Another rumor had it that the arrest of Yang Lide was related to the Li and Wen cases. Some said that Yang's arrest was due to another case. These rumors, before the case has been solved, are not enough to serve as a basis for facts, but they have a significant impact on the people of Yunnan. On the morning of the 23rd, the news that Commander-in-Chief Huo had flown to Lushan was not publicly announced by the Kunming newspapers, so another rumor arose. Some said that the Yunnan Provincial Government would be reorganized, and some said that Huo did not want to come again. It was not until the day after Lu and Huo returned to Kunming on the same plane on the 27th that the rumors of a change in the Yunnan situation subsided.</p>
<h3>The Problem Awaits Resolution</h3>
<p>The central government, according to the expressions of all parties, is extremely concerned and attaches great importance to the Li and Wen cases. The highest-ranking military, police, and gendarmerie officials in the country have all come to Kunming one after another to handle the work of solving the case. Secretary-General Yan left Kunming on the 22nd. The next day, the newspapers published a report from the Central News Agency, saying that there was solid leads on the two cases, and that the whole case would be revealed soon. From the 23rd to the 26th, Director Tang of the Police Department was in Kunming, continuing to supervise and inspect the two cases. On the 27th, Chairman Chiang specially sent Commander-in-Chief Gu Zhutong, accompanied by Gendarmerie Commander Zhang Zhen and Deputy Chief of Staff of the Army Headquarters Leng Xin, to Kunming to handle the matter with full authority. The three have been in Kunming for three days now, and are listening to reports from all parties and reviewing the case in detail. Some say that the case is complex and involves a great deal, which is probably the biggest reason why the case has not yet been announced.</p>

<p>Hoping for Importance of Teachers' Qualifications</p>
<p>Dear Editor:</p>
<p>Today, as Shanghai is experiencing both unemployment and a shortage of talent, I want to raise a question! Chinese society is so contradictory! Supply and demand, in particular, are unable to meet each other's needs (even though there are so-called employment agencies). Advertisements for "recruitment" and "seeking employment," often of the same nature, are often found shining together one after the other in newspapers. Why not let them cooperate? Taking primary school teachers as an example, advertisements for "hiring" and "seeking employment" are also frequently seen in newspapers, showing that even "chalk artists" are doing the same thing. In fact, there are not many qualified teachers, but there are still a large number seeking employment. It's truly contradictory! The day before yesterday, the newspaper reported the results of the Education Bureau's registration and verification of primary school teachers. While some were qualified, many still needed to undergo a trial verification. This, of course, includes both public and private primary schools. Not to mention the alleyway schools, even the dignified municipal national schools should try their best to hire qualified teachers to avoid misleading the children. I sincerely hope that the education authorities will not only announce the "registration" results but also further pay attention to Article 68 of the Primary School Regulations, which states, "Two months before the start of each academic year, their qualifications shall be announced." And order all municipal schools to "only hire those who are registered and announced." With the autumn semester starting soon, the seriousness of sending the next generation into a fire pit should be reduced somewhat. This is, of course, something that people in society desperately want, and the wise education authorities should not deny that this measure is necessary, and should even mark it with "expedite!" Especially since it is stipulated by law! (Ji Bai)</p>
<p>Gambling Sounds Disturb Neighbors</p>
<p>Chinese people love to gamble and often gamble wildly all night long. The sound of mahjong tiles is so loud that it makes it impossible to sleep. I live on Beijing West Road, and the house of the Ningbo people next door is as spacious as mine, but the sound of their mahjong tiles is as clear as if it were in my own room. Because it is summer, the windows are all open, making it very easy for sounds to travel. If they were one floor away, the sound would be as if it were right next to my ear. The sound of mahjong tiles is already piercing, not to mention the Ningbo dialect mixed in with the calls of the tiles. You sing one tile, I sing another, and he sings yet another, continuing until dawn before stopping. All the neighbors find this family annoying. If we were to interfere with them, we would inevitably get upset. Originally, there is a limit to how much one can enjoy oneself. Before twelve o'clock, everyone can make a racket, but when others want to sleep, they shouldn't be disturbed. This situation is common in Shanghai, and I hope that the authorities will pay more attention to it. They should send police officers to patrol the streets and alleys to check for the sound of radios and mahjong tiles. If the sound of mahjong tiles is loud enough to pierce the ears of the police officers, then it is already disturbing people's sleep and should be prohibited immediately. As for whether gambling is prohibited, it must also be investigated and dealt with separately according to the law. Please pay attention to this, police station. (Jiang Yimin)</p>
<p>Congestion on Xinqiao Road</p>
<p>Dear Editor:</p>
<p>Xinqiao Road is an important road connecting the Xincheng and Zhabei districts. Recently, it has been lined with vendors, and filth is everywhere. The road surface there was originally very narrow, which has made it even more congested with vehicles and pedestrians. This not only obstructs traffic but also affects hygiene, and the vendors blocking doors are affecting the business of the shops on both sides. I am writing to urge the authorities to pay attention to this and promptly take action to eliminate the problem. (Sha Jiren)</p>
<h3>What I Know About the Shijin Canal July 26th, Tianjin News</h3>
<p>— Yu Xin</p>
<p>The Shijin Canal can be compared to the Tanggu New Port. Its starting point is Shijiazhuang (Shimen), and its endpoint is the Tianjin docks. In order to carry out this project, the Japanese mobilized many engineers from the Japanese mainland to assist the puppet Public Works Bureau in completing it on schedule. They also had the Japanese army and engineers cooperate, sparing no expense and transporting huge amounts of materials. They used a large number of cheap coolies from North China—speaking of which, it is extremely heartbreaking. The villagers of our Shide County and the thirteen surrounding counties along the Pinghan Railway were all driven by them. The "North China Labor Association" also helped the wicked do evil by searching for laborers. The "North China Transportation Company" provided free transportation at each station. It is pitiful that thousands of these villagers died on the way or were sick and trapped in the straw sheds concentrated by the Public Works Bureau every day. The puppet Public Works Bureau had light, small freight cars responsible for transporting them between Liuxinzhuang Station and Huangbizhuang Station in Shimen. Most of these laborers who fled halfway were shot dead by the labor police. This kind of "armed construction" by the Japanese only made the psychology of a large number of villagers tend to deteriorate. This kind of sinful and tyrannical rule was hated by everyone!</p>
<p>However, the Shijin Canal has now been partially completed. One month before the Nazis were annihilated—last April—the Shimen Engineering Bureau of the puppet Public Works Bureau held a water diversion ceremony at Huangbizhuang in Pingshan County, southern Hebei. A stone monument was erected on the high ground above the water intake to commemorate those who died in the line of duty for the project. A total of fifty-two people died, and Japanese instructors from the puppet Bureau's security team accounted for four-fifths of them. The Huangbizhuang water intake gate has five sluice gates, and winches were installed on the gates, all painted bright red beforehand. On that day, two Japanese unit commanders, the head of the puppet Engineering Bureau, the Japanese person in charge, Yano, and two Japanese contractors presided over the "grand ceremony" of opening the gates to divert water. At the scene, the Japanese counselor Yano said in his speech: "This part of the project has been completed, and other parts still need to be worked on. We would like to thank the 'Japanese-Chinese' officers and civilians and pay our greatest respect to the spirits of those who died during the three years of construction."</p>
<p>Construction of the Shijin Canal began in 1942. The aqueduct part was divided into three stages: tunnels, culverts, and open channels, and the entire project has been completed. Before the tunnel is the water intake (including five sluice gates) for diverting water from the Hutuo River. As for the dam that the Japanese wanted to build, only 80% of the "base work" was completed last year. In order to sink the caissons, many unused nine-meter-long large iron rails were borrowed from the north bank of the Yellow River to press down these reinforced concrete caissons—the caissons are the foundation under the dam. This work was quite heavy, starting with drilling the soil quality from the lower layer of the riverbed, surveying, drawing, making caissons, sinking them, raising them again, and sinking them again. The sinking continued until it met the planned requirements, and then construction of the dam began. It is a pity that the Japanese did not complete it. Until last year, they changed their plans many times, and as a result, they only perfunctorily did a fake water intake project for the "military" and called it a day. (Fake water intake is temporary water diversion)</p>
<p>It wasn't that they really didn't want to complete the water intake dam. The reasons were: (1) The local security was not good. Near the construction site, the guerrillas were always coming and going. (2) Materials were difficult to obtain. Large-scale purchases of materials by the puppet Public Works Bureau had to be approved by the Beijing (Japanese Asia Development Board) and recognized by all parties of the Japanese Imperial Army. Before Germany collapsed, all military supplies were subject to strict control, so there was a shortage of materials from the beginning of construction. However, it was not easy to get the river to divert water. (3) The Japanese technical staff were timid. The Japanese supervisors often encountered mines placed by the guerrillas to "treat" them as they walked through the construction sections. After several risky incidents, they also retreated timidly and did not dare to continue. Moreover, long-distance passenger cars were also often threatened, so the plan was revised repeatedly, becoming more and more shoddy in order to complete it quickly and reduce responsibility. Their construction plan was as follows, divided into five sections (see the table below).</p>
<p>The above plan was scheduled to be completed in five years. As of last April, however, only an outline had been drawn, and the basic dam had not been completed.</p>
<p>The construction site is in Huangbizhuang, Pingshan County, Hebei. The general plan for this canal is to divert water from Huangbizhuang to Shimen (Shijiazhuang) and use the new aqueduct to divert water for irrigation of arable land in Jin County and Zhaocheng along the Shide Line (Shimen east to Dezhou) to promote increased cotton and wheat production. From Jin and Zhao eastward, it merges with the old Ziya River channel, and after repairing and dredging the old channel, it goes upstream directly to Tianjin. This plan is the ambition of the Japanese to transport goods and consolidate their territory along the line. Speaking of its water source, the original location was in Weizhou Town, Jingxing County, where a water storage dam was to be built, using the water from the Ye River, a tributary of the Hutuo River, to increase the reservoir and regulate the water volume. The water storage dam was planned to be made of reinforced concrete. The total water storage capacity is 120 million cubic meters, and the effective water storage capacity is 82 million cubic meters. A hydroelectric power station with an estimated capacity of 4,000 kW (electricity) will also be built using this large amount of water.</p>
<p>The aqueduct part of the river is 30 kilometers long in total, including two kilometers of tunnels and five kilometers of culverts, and the rest is open channels. It took three years to build during the enemy puppet era; it can be considered completed. Both the tunnel entrance and the water intake have horizontal stone plaques, which were inscribed by Su Tiren and others.</p>

<h3>Urgent Matters in Zhejiang Security First</h3>
<p>— Our newspaper's 25th Hangzhou dispatch Special correspondent Chu Yusheng</p>
<p>When I came to Hangzhou from Shanghai at the beginning of April this year, I met a Shaoxing man with a full beard on the train. He said: "The countryside in some counties is really not peaceful. Guerrillas and the New Fourth Army are stirring things up. Although we have won the victory now, who is willing to go back to their hometown to work hard in the fields after getting used to cheap food?" It has been almost four months since I came to Zhejiang. In these four months, I have heard nothing but news of bandits appearing and looting. I once went to the plain area of western Zhejiang, and the county authorities also admitted that they felt that the security problem was tricky. Therefore, the newspapers in Hangzhou almost every day have headlines reporting news of bandit robberies, either passenger buses on the highway are robbed, or motorboats on rivers are robbed, or ships are stolen, or things are taken away from people's homes, or even county self-defense forces mutiny, or tourists' jewelry is taken away. Recently, I saw a special feature in a Shanghai × newspaper, with an article entitled "The Difficulty of the Zhejiang Road." Of course, there must be many places in this article describing the major security problems on the transportation routes.</p>
<p>Who is Willing to Work Hard in the Fields After Getting Used to Cheap Food</p>
<p>Shen Honglie, chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, also feels that the most urgent measure in Zhejiang at present is to solve the security problem. Indeed, if security cannot be maintained, everything will come to a standstill, just like a person will die if the blood is not circulating. After the security problem was raised, I contacted the Zhejiang provincial authorities many times and learned that a specific solution had been discussed with the Quzhou Pacification Headquarters. That is, the bandits at the border between the two provinces will be jointly suppressed by teams from the two provinces, and the suppression will be directed by personnel from the Pacification Headquarters. The bandits on the main lines will be cleared by teams from the Pacification Headquarters. The bandits between counties will be suppressed by the administrative inspectorate. The scattered bandits within the county will be cleared by the county government, and the organized bandits will be cleared by the provincial security team. The province has allocated 30 million yuan for this expenditure. Moreover, scattered soldiers and vagrants will be taken in by the county and sent back to their original homes. Those who belong to other provinces will be transferred by neighboring counties, and those who belong to provinces further away will be transferred by neighboring provinces. Recently, the provincial government held a provincial administrative meeting and decided on a joint guarantee system, that is, each household will jointly guarantee that it will not harbor bandits, and decided to spend 100 million yuan on clearing the countryside. Chairman Shen also said to reporters: "There are few real bandits now, and most of them are scattered soldiers and vagrants. Some of these scattered soldiers and vagrants are officers and soldiers who have been discharged, and more of them are from other provinces than from this province. Some are guerrillas who have been discharged, and some are puppet soldiers who have been eliminated, and more of them are from this province than from other provinces. These people must be able to return to work, and then Zhejiang's security can be maintained." But as the Shaoxing man said, "Who is willing to go back to their hometown to work hard in the fields after getting used to cheap food?"</p>
<p>Bandits Still Hide Traces Disasters are Getting Worse</p>
<p>Originally, Zhejiang can be said to have very few bandits. Although it was said in the past that there were bandits in Xianju and Pan'an counties, it was not very serious. It was only because the mountain villages in eastern Zhejiang had inconvenient transportation that there were reports of bandits. However, at that time, the bandits of Taihu Lake in western Zhejiang often appeared and harassed Jiaxing and Wuxing. In the years 1929 and 1930, there was a so-called Taibao Ashu who dominated the area around Taihu Lake for a while, because Taihu Lake does not belong to one province and has a very large area, so it is very easy for lake bandits to hide. In addition, the pirates in the Wenzhou-Taizhou area were also very famous. However, they often appeared on the sea and seemed to have little relationship with Zhejiang Province. Other parts of the Xianxia Mountains were sometimes not very peaceful because they were at the junction of Fujian and Zhejiang, but it was not too serious. During the Anti-Japanese War, everyone was engaged in the Anti-Japanese War, and there was only harassment from the enemy puppet troops. Sometimes the "New Fourth Army" also came to cause trouble. In general, there was no phenomenon of bandits like hair. Now, on this day a year after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the degree of lake bandits in western Zhejiang has deepened, and the junction of the Xianxia Mountains in eastern Zhejiang need not be said, and the Siming Mountains at the junction of Kuocang Mountain, Shangyu, Yuyao, Fenghua, Ningbo, Sheng County, Xinchang, and Ciqi in the Wenzhou-Taizhou area are not very peaceful. It is said that the enemy and the "New Fourth Army" have both lived in the Siming Mountains. This mountain has a very large area and is very deep. The "New Fourth Army" once created the "Chuanshan Policy," which was to connect the Siming Mountains, Tianmu Mountains, and Kuaiji Mountains into one piece, which could include more than ten counties in eastern Zhejiang. However, these plans were not successful. According to several people in the area, there were actually no communists at that time. Only a few communists came and organized some local bandits, scattered soldiers, vagrants, and puppet soldiers.</p>
<p>The current bandits, as Shen Honglie said, are scattered soldiers and vagrants, but so many scattered soldiers and vagrants causing such chaos is enough to cause great trouble. Moreover, the politics after the victory are really not very satisfactory. Taxes are added to the people layer by layer, but there is no guarantee for the people's lives and property. How can people endure living like this? Naturally, some will take risks.</p>
<h3>Clearing is Not Enough Political Improvement is Also Needed</h3>
<p>Therefore, although it is a security problem, it involves a very wide range of things. It is not enough to just clear it. We also need political improvement. In fact, political improvement can curb the source of chaos. Of course, in the current stage, we are not opposed to clearing. We want clean politics and the implementation of clearing scattered bandits. Do not use clearing as an excuse to accuse and frame people. Do not use clearing as an excuse to establish many countryside clearing institutions and then demand money from the people. All of this is wrong. As Shen Honglie said, now we must "give the people a rest," so clearing the countryside is to eliminate the bad guys who disturb the people and make them uneasy, so as to "give the people a rest."</p>
<p>We ask the government to actively take in scattered soldiers and vagrants, and all soldiers with untidy clothes and no symbols should be sent to the reception center, and the people should be rewarded for doing so. We ask the government to strictly control the areas of the Siming Mountains, Tianmu Mountains, Kuaiji Mountains, etc., so as to prevent bad guys from hiding. We hope that Zhejiang will return to an era of peace and prosperity.</p>
<p>A friend said angrily: "Since the Kuomintang and the Communist Party are still going to fight, why did they have to downsize the army, resulting in discharged soldiers causing such chaos and making our Zhejiang so uneasy." But downsizing the army is ultimately a necessary policy of the country. We ultimately do not want the Kuomintang and the Communist Party to really fight. We would rather find a way to solve our current pain.</p>
<h3>Full Picture of the Zhejiang Administrative Conference</h3>
<p>— 21st Hangzhou Dispatch Our Newspaper Reporter Huang Xing Tian</p>
<p>"Nineteen provinces and regions are reporting disasters, and 30 million people are starving." The current situation in China has reached the point of bankruptcy, but there are still people who disregard the people's suffering and deliberately cause internal strife! Just taking Zhejiang as an example, if we open the newspapers in Hangzhou, the provincial capital, there is news of bandits robbing and disasters being severe every day. To borrow Chairman Shen's own words, after he inspected five administrative regions, a total of more than 20 counties, "I saw that the county towns and large towns were thoroughly destroyed by the enemy, the mountains were bare everywhere, water conservancy was in disrepair, food was insufficient for the people, security was poor, and the burden of military food was particularly overwhelming, and the county governments mostly borrowed people's houses, schools mostly borrowed temples, the police were short of food and clothing, the lives of public school teachers were difficult, and everything was waiting to be done, but no money could be found..." The people's pain and the government's difficulties are all in his words. But how can we break through this difficult situation? Chairman Shen convened a provincial administrative conference just three months after taking office, and his greatest motivation was to relieve the people's difficulties and find a suitable medicine for the local government, which was suffering from severe anemia.</p>
<h3>Administrative Conference Like a Doctors' Consultation</h3>
<p>"Zhejiang is a healthy person, but now he is suffering from a severe typhoid fever. Officials are originally doctors, and the administrative conference is like a doctors' meeting." The treatment of Zhejiang, this patient, by these doctors is based on Chairman Shen's instructions and starts from five central issues. The first issue is civil affairs, mainly to promote administrative efficiency by consolidating land registration, household registration, improving grass-roots organizations, cutting redundant personnel and institutions, raising the salaries of public school teachers, and reducing the size of the police force. The second issue is finance. Solving the financial difficulties is an urgent task of the current administrative work. They believe that in addition to properly taxed taxes that must be collected and managed in accordance with the central government's regulations, the first priority is to abolish excessive taxes, strictly prohibit apportionments, eliminate malpractices in grain administration, simplify procedures, and in accordance with the central government's regulations, without the approval of the local public opinion organs and the approval of the provincial government, they shall not arbitrarily take it from the people. Today, the country is full of scars, and the current priority is to give the people a rest. Things that are not urgent can be done slowly, and actions that disturb the people must be eliminated. The provincial government's financial measures take "living within our means" as the way to balance revenue and expenditure, so it needs to cut spending to reduce the burden on the people. The third issue is education. It is generally believed that the focus should be on improving quality, because the original educational foundation of Zhejiang has been destroyed by the war. Not only are there not enough school buildings and equipment, but also teachers are struggling on the poverty line, so it is difficult for them to work with peace of mind. Moreover, because talents are concentrated in cities, there is a lack of primary school teachers, which has become a common phenomenon. In the future, secondary education in various counties should be strengthened, and the treatment standards of national education must be standardized and the system institutionalized, so as to take from the countryside and use it in the countryside. Fourth, the construction problem is first to develop water conservancy to prevent natural disasters; and to increase the production of grains to enrich the people's food supply. Since the Anti-Japanese War, a large number of trees have been cut down over the years, and many river channels have been blocked. At present, the floods are already considerable, but they are only in the initial stage. If this is not treated, the future consequences will be disastrous, so both small and large water conservancy projects in various counties must be carried out according to their capacity in order to turn misfortune into blessing. Although Zhejiang is known as a rich land, it still needs to rely on neighboring provinces for food, which is unreasonable, so we must promote winter cultivation, develop wasteland, in order to increase the area of production, and improve seeds and prevent pests, in order to increase the unit of production. Fifth, the security problem is to suppress bandits, although it has been two months, but there has been little effect. The fundamental solution is to eliminate the source and block the flow, and to treat both the symptoms and the root causes. First, use the rule of law, and then use moral education. The people must be able to live, learn and be taught, so that they cannot be bandits, do not have to be bandits, and are not willing to be bandits.</p>
<h3>100 Million Yuan Allocated for Clearing the Countryside</h3>
<p>The provincial government has now decided to allocate 100 million yuan for clearing the countryside. The allocation standard will be based on the following factors: the state of public security in each county (40%), the total population (30%), the land area (20%), and the transportation conditions (10%). All counties in Zhejiang will be divided into ten grades. Grade A (1 county) will receive 1.75 million yuan, Grade B (4 counties) will each receive 1.65 million yuan, Grade C (3 counties) will each receive 1.55 million yuan, Grade D (4 counties) will each receive 1.45 million yuan, Grade E (8 counties) will each receive 1.35 million yuan, Grade F (13 counties) will each receive 1.25 million yuan, Grade G (12 counties) will each receive 1.15 million yuan, Grade H (13 counties) will each receive 1.05 million yuan, Grade I (12 counties) will each receive 950,000 yuan, and Grade J (7 counties) will each receive 850,000 yuan. Each county must allocate 20% for office expenses, 30% for printing expenses related to joint security pledges, 40% for clearing the countryside, and 10% for miscellaneous expenses. Clearing the countryside and joint security are aimed at dealing with "bandit gangs" and "robber bandits." As for scattered vagrants, they will be ordered to be taken in. The required rice ration will be 25 taels per person per day, and the allowance for side dishes will be provisionally set at 4,000 yuan per person per month, to be drawn from the grain reserves of each county. The travel expenses for sending people back to their hometowns will be separately allocated by the provincial government at 5,000 yuan. Whether it is clearing the countryside or joint security, the purpose is to alleviate the suffering of the people and not to increase it. The work in the past was obviously not done very well. Provincial Temporary Assembly Secretary-General Lin said: "The rural villages are simply in a state of chaos!" Today, with the ambition to "rescue the people from fire and water," the wise and enlightened officials governing Zhejiang should be deeply vigilant.</p>
<h3>Financial Revenue and Expenditure Tightly Balanced</h3>
<p>Next is the issue of balancing financial revenue and expenditure. The people have been exhausted by the suffering of the eight-year war of resistance. They already feel overwhelmed by the central government's requisition of goods and the local government's excessive taxes. Representatives from ten districts have come to Hangzhou to request tax reductions, and representatives from districts have come to Hangzhou to request exemption from in-kind levies. The government, on the one hand, has to supply military provisions, and on the other hand, it needs funds for annual expenses. All agencies feel that they do not have enough money. Therefore, some people in the meeting requested that each county be able to set up taxes appropriate to local conditions according to actual needs, but not adopt the methods of "transit tax" and "entry tax." However, this was ultimately not passed due to the resolute opposition of Ruan Yicheng, the director of the civil affairs department. Therefore, for financial measures, we still need to live within our means. According to the budget for the next year, the provincial government needs approximately 28 billion yuan, while the income is only approximately 18 billion yuan. The county-level budget needs approximately 55 billion yuan, while the income is only approximately 40 billion yuan. The shortfall is planned to be balanced by tightening up in various ways. As for the collection of in-kind goods, in addition to the "requisition," "loan," "provincial and county public grain," and "landlord grain reserves" that should be collected according to law, no other names should be used for requisition or disguised collection.</p>
<p>Due to the government's financial constraints and the low salaries of public school personnel, it has become a common phenomenon. Yu Shuluan, the special commissioner of the Second District, reported to the conference: "The county-level personnel with the highest salaries are in Wuxing, but the county magistrate with a monthly salary of 300 yuan, plus subsidies (105 times) and living allowances (31,000 yuan), only receives a little over 63,000 yuan. The lowest is Changxing, where an employee with a monthly salary of 50 yuan, plus subsidies (60 times) and living allowances (20,000 yuan), only receives a little over 23,000 yuan. The salaries of township-level personnel are also the highest in Wuxing, but an employee with a monthly salary of 80 yuan, plus subsidies (105 times) and living allowances (31,000 yuan), only receives a little over 39,000 yuan. Deqing has the lowest, where an employee with a monthly salary of 45 yuan, plus subsidies (35 times) and living allowances (10,000 yuan), only receives a little over 11,000 yuan. Under such difficult circumstances, it will either create a situation where every official is corrupt, or it will trap work in a 'hemiplegic state.' Therefore, he loudly appealed that the central government only knows how to increase the salaries of central government employees but does not care about the province, the province does not care about the salaries of county-level employees, and the county does not care about the township! In short, there is no overall planning..." The conference has now decided that "the salaries of county-level public school personnel will be increased by 240 times for 50 yuan, with a minimum of 40,000 yuan, using the average rice price in the local area in April, May, and June as the distinguishing standard, and the salaries of township-level personnel will be 70% of the county level." The numbers have increased, but they still cannot keep up with prices. It seems that public servants will have to endure a lifetime of hardship until the overall situation is clarified, banditry is eradicated, and the country is prosperous and the people are at peace.</p>
<h3>Eliminating Floods and Implementing Flood Control Projects</h3>
<p>Flooding disasters are also a serious problem in Zhejiang. Because the province's terrain is high and mountainous in the southwest, and it faces the sea and has many plains in the east, the total area of mountainous land in the province reaches more than 100.7 million mu, accounting for 76% of the province's land area. Therefore, the southwestern counties lack arable land. According to the statistics of the Ministry of Industry before the war, the total area of forests in the province is less than 10 million mu. The mountains are barren, and the water source cannot be conserved. When it rains, mountain floods break out, and the plains become swamps. In long droughts, the fields crack, and the red soil stretches for thousands of miles. After the War of Resistance, it was difficult to adjust food supplies, and the practice of destroying forests and burning land became more prevalent. Water and drought disasters became more and more serious. Therefore, there is an urgent need to vigorously carry out afforestation and forest protection, implement land reclamation to conserve water and soil, prevent and control water and drought disasters, and secure people's livelihoods. The Department of Construction also proposed a proposal centered on building flood control projects and small-scale farmland water conservancy projects in various counties. The specific methods are to first carry out emergency flood control projects on the major rivers that are most severely affected, starting this year. Taking advantage of the slack winter season for forestry and agriculture, the national mandatory labor service method will be used to handle all flood control projects and collect necessary materials. The main flood control areas are: (1) Upper reaches of the Qiantang River: to be handled jointly by Jiangshan, Changshan, Kaihua, Qu County, Longyou, Tangxi, Jiande, Tonglu, Xindeng, Fuyang, Jinhua, Pujiang, Zhuji, and other counties; (2) Pujiang River: to be handled jointly by Zhuji Xiaochuan, Pujiang, Yiwu, and other counties; (5) Xin'an River: to be handled jointly by Chun'an, Jiande, Shouchang, Sui'an, and other counties; (4) Wu River: to be handled jointly by Dongyang, Yiwu, Jinhua, Lanxi, Yongkang, Wuyi, Tangxi, and other counties; (5) Cao'e River: to be handled jointly by Shaoxing, Shangyu, Sheng County, Xinchang, Dongyang, and other counties; (6) East and West Tiaoxi Rivers: to be handled jointly by Anji, Xiaofeng, Changxing, Wudian, Deqing, Yuhang, Lin'an, Wukang, and other counties; (7) Ling River: to be handled jointly by Huangyan, Linhai, Tiantai, Xianju, and other counties; (8) Ou River: to be handled jointly by Qingyuan, Longquan, Lishui, Qingtian, Suichang, Songyang, Jinyun, Jingning, Xuanping, and other counties; (9) Feiyun River: to be handled jointly by Pingyang, Ruian, Taishun, and other counties; (10) Ao River: to be handled by Pingyang County. As for small-scale farmland water conservancy projects, the focus in the plain counties is on irrigation and drainage; in the mountainous counties, the focus is on the digging of ponds for water storage and the construction of sluice gates for water diversion, as advocated by the central government. Each county and city aims to benefit an average of 5,000 mu of farmland each year, and the entire province aims to complete more than 380,000 mu each year. The plain irrigation rivers and dikes will be dredged and repaired to completion; in the mountainous areas, one pond will be completed for every 20 mu of waterless upland fields starting from 1947, reaching the goal of one pond for every 20 mu.</p>
<h3>Conference Passes Three-Year Construction Plan</h3>
<p>In addition to the above four important and urgent issues, the conference also passed the Zhejiang Three-Year Construction Plan, the Outline of Work for 1947, the Outline of the Central Work Plan for the second half of 1946, and dozens of other constructive proposals. Judging from the current state of Zhejiang, the prescription decided by the "doctors' meeting" is not a "miracle cure," but it is inevitable that considerable results can be expected. The degree of success mainly depends on how well the "doctors" serve. Diagnosis is one thing, and treatment is another. Without careful and enthusiastic care and dedicated treatment, the disease will not improve. The decision has already been made, and we sincerely hope that the decision can be implemented. Although Dr. Sun Yat-sen advocated the theory of knowing is difficult but acting is easy, it is not easy to act without great courage and great perseverance. Therefore, in his closing remarks, Chairman Shen encouraged the heads of various departments, commissioners, and county magistrates with "expanding knowledge and acting diligently," and even more with "bearing hardship and resentment." Indeed, for a patient like Zhejiang who is suffering from a severe typhoid fever, if the "attending physicians" are unwilling to bear hardship and resentment, the future is unimaginable!</p>
<p>Social Services</p>
<h3>Answering Readers: Medicine and Hygiene</h3>
<p>(1) Wang Junmin asks: Editor, every time I read Shen Bao, I see the lofty enthusiasm of your column for social service, which makes me feel infinite admiration! I am a 23-year-old male. In these 20 years, I have never had a serious illness, nor have I suffered from ear diseases. When I was young, my head was often slapped by my strict father. Subsequently, my ears suddenly became deaf without any obvious reason. Within one yard, I can distinguish the sounds of ordinary conversations, but beyond three or four yards, I can only hear the pitch of the sound, but I cannot tell what the words are. Is it because of physical weakness, or is it due to the impact on the head and the eardrum being shattered? How should I treat it? I hope you can tell me. If it can be cured, I can avoid lifelong pain, all thanks to your column.</p>
<p>[Dr. Gu Yuqi answers] For hearing loss in both ears, you need to consult a specialist otolaryngologist for a detailed examination to see if there is otitis media or tympanic membrane perforation and other functional diseases, or whether there is syphilis in the blood? All must be carefully examined before a diagnosis can be made.</p>
<p>(2) Lv Ganhan asks: My wife has been suffering from irregular menstruation for a long time, either once every two months or once every three months, with no fixed period. In addition, there are no other symptoms, so she has never sought medical treatment. I don't know if this will have any impact on her health and fertility in the long run? Please also tell me the name of an effective medicine. I am extremely anxious for an answer.</p>
<p>[Dr. Gu Yuqi answers] Your wife's irregular menstruation requires blood-tonifying and endocrine-tonifying medicines, such as Vita-Life Women's Tonic and Kang Fu Duo, etc. It is best to ask a specialist gynecologist to examine her.</p>
<p>(3) Wu Baosheng asks: I am 21 years old, unmarried, male. In the spring of 16, I entered a silver box factory as an apprentice. In the summer of 17, a lump grew in my left armpit. The following autumn, there were two lumps eight inches from the armpit on my left hand. I applied Invincible brand toothpaste, and it healed in two months, and it has not rotted until now. In the spring of 18, a lump also grew in my right armpit, and four or five lumps also grew on my left chest. The lumps gradually grew larger. The following year, five or six lumps also grew on my right neck. The lumps in both armpits and on the chest grew to about an inch or two in diameter. I don't feel any pain. Last year, my right eye turned red and hurt, and I couldn't see for more than 40 days before it gradually healed. I wonder what disease this is? Is there an economical way to treat it?</p>
<p>[Dr. Gu Yuqi answers] Based on the various situations described in your letter, I am afraid it is lymphadenopathy. You need to take blood-tonifying and lung-tonifying medicines internally, such as various vitamins, etc.</p>
<h3>Orphan and Widow Relief Fund Appeals for Donations from All Sectors</h3>
<p>Only 130,000 Yuan Left in the Fund, Urgently Needs Replenishment</p>
<p>The fourth batch of 15 applicants for the "Orphan, Widow, Poor, and Sick Relief Fund" entrusted to this column by Qingxia Elderly, except for those residing in other places and those whose procedures did not meet the requirements, were temporarily deferred. A total of seven people were approved, and a total of 530,000 yuan was allocated for relief expenses. The following is an excerpt from the letter:</p>
<p>(1) Ding Cheng Qiaozhen, her husband died three years ago, leaving behind two children. The family is poor and cannot make a living. She is now a teacher at an orphanage, but her meager income cannot last long. 80,000 yuan is allocated for the children's education and living expenses.</p>

<p>Income and Expenditure Report</p>
<p>The Qingxia Elderly Orphan, Widow, Poor, and Sick Relief Fund received 1.85 million yuan. Yesterday, it received a generous donation of 100,000 yuan from Mr. "Seeking No Disease," for a total of 1.95 million yuan. The expenditures are as follows:</p>
<p>The first batch of three approved people received a total of 180,000 yuan</p>
<p>The second batch of five approved people received a total of 350,000 yuan</p>
<p>The third batch of nine approved people received a total of 760,000 yuan</p>
<p>The fourth batch of seven approved people received a total of 530,000 yuan</p>
<p>(to be issued soon) The above total income is 1.95 million yuan, and the total expenditure is 1.82 million yuan, with a balance of 130,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Appeal for Donations</p>
<p>The situation of the "Orphan, Widow, Poor, and Sick Relief Fund," which was first initiated by Qingxia Elderly and entrusted to this column, has been reported in detail before the war and has won the sympathy of people from all walks of life. In recent days, the number of applicants has gradually increased, and donations should be solicited and handled carefully to seek peace of mind. According to the above table, there is only a balance of 130,000 yuan. This relief work will face the sigh of "no rice to cook." It is hoped that Qingxia Elderly and enthusiastic people will provide a steady stream of support, so that this kind of direct relief work will not be abandoned halfway. (Editor)</p>
<h3>Lixing Cigarette Factory Workers Plead for the People of Northern Jiangsu</h3>
<p>Viewing Fellow Cigarette Factories Launching Donations</p>
<p>Editor, Northern Jiangsu is torn by continuous war, and the people are displaced. People in the country are all compatriots, how can we sit idly by and do nothing? My colleagues and I have donated 335,000 yuan to help the refugees in Northern Jiangsu from our savings. However, it is like a drop in the bucket, and the meager amount cannot save millions of refugees from their plight. We sincerely hope that philanthropists at sea and fellow industries with larger scales can respond widely and jointly participate in this righteous act, so as to avoid millions of innocent refugees from starving to death. That would be very fortunate for us. This is to ask you to write about it. From all male and female workers of Lixing Cigarette Factory.</p>
<p>Donations for Refugees in Northern Jiangsu</p>
<p>335,000 yuan from male and female workers of Lixing Cigarette Factory, 200,000 yuan from Mr. Wu of Defu Foreign Company, 100,000 yuan from Mrs. Liu, 11,000 yuan from two workers in the writing room of Jiecheng Foreign Company, 10,000 yuan from Kong Xinyi and Kong Huijuan, 6,000 yuan from Fang Qixian, 4,000 yuan from Li Lansheng, 3,000 yuan from Ye Yongli, for a total of 669,000 yuan.

<h3>Lanzhou Weekly</h3>
<p>— (July 14th to 21st, special correspondent of this newspaper, Bingzi)</p>
<p>In order to promote economic construction throughout the province and improve people's living standards, the Gansu Provincial Government has specially organized the Gansu Provincial Economic Construction Committee, which has been established. The position of Director of the Committee is concurrently held by Chairman Gu Zhenglun.</p>
<p>In order to ensure the safety of the urban area, the police and military organs conducted temporary inspections on the 14th and 15th. Pedestrian traffic was prohibited in the streets and alleys in a very short period of time. The inspection results showed that public security was excellent.</p>
<p>On the 15th, the Municipal Government held a collective graduation ceremony for students from municipal elementary schools at the Anti-Japanese Construction Hall in Lan Garden. Nineteen schools participated, with 512 graduating students. This is still an innovation in Lanzhou.</p>
<p>Labrang News: The Auxiliary State Illustrious Zen Master Jiamuyang Hutuktu and Labrang Security Commander Huang Zhengqing mobilized the military and civilians in their Tibetan areas to practice riding and shooting. More than 20,000 people participated, setting up camps in the Sanke Grassland, 15 miles from Labrang Monastery, and formally practicing on the 13th, including horse racing and shooting arrows and guns on horseback. The general riding skills and shooting skills were excellent, and the event was unprecedentedly grand.</p>
<p>Following the opening of the Shanghai-Lanzhou route by China National Aviation Corporation, the Shanghai-Lanzhou route of Central Air Transport Corporation also opened on the 18th, scheduled to fly from Shanghai to Lanzhou once every Thursday, with a ticket price of 154,000 yuan per passenger.</p>
<p>The Municipal Government has banned beggars along the streets, and has allocated special funds to take in 153 people. Except for 40 elderly, weak, disabled, and young children who will be kept for support, all others will be sent to work in wheat fields and brick kilns in various villages.</p>
<p>The Hexi Qilian Mountains area of Gansu Province has always been inhabited by Mongolian and Tibetan compatriots as nomadic areas. The household registration of Baojia has not yet been compiled, and the local organizations still follow the old rules. In order to support the border people and strengthen the organization, the Provincial Government has formulated measures for compiling and organizing Baojia in the Qilian Mountains border area, and has submitted them to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Interior for approval. Yang Jingmin, the section chief of the Department of Civil Affairs, has been appointed as the supervisor to go to the Qilian Mountains to start the compilation and inspection.</p>
<p>The price of gold fell again and again, and the price of gold bars fell from 216,000 yuan per tael to 200,500 yuan. The price of grain also fell as new wheat entered the market, with wheat at 19,000 yuan per unit.</p>

<h3>Summer in Lushan</h3>
<p>— Ping Zhai</p>
<p>Since the summer of the 26th year of the Republic of China, we can no longer look at Lushan with the eyes of admiring scenic spots and historical sites.</p>
<p>The eight years of fierce War of Resistance wrote a glorious prologue in Lushan. Lushan has since become an immortal name in the history of the revival of the Chinese nation. This name will forever symbolize unity, heroism, victory, and glory.</p>
<p>This summer, Lushan is facing its first summer after victory. After nine years of neglect, this Chinese "Summer Capital" has awakened.</p>
<p>President Chiang and his wife, who have worked hard and made great contributions, have returned to their old touring grounds. Moreover, Marshal Marshall, a true friend of China, has also come to this beautiful summer capital. His hard work day and night will always be remembered by all the Chinese people.</p>
<p>Ambassador Stuart walked to</p>
<p>He presented his credentials to the President's residence, which was an unprecedented event in diplomatic history—Ambassador Stuart added an unprecedented charm to diplomatic history: May this kind of sincerity and simplicity forever replace red tape in international negotiations in the future!</p>
<p>Then, Norwegian Ambassador Oerl and Afghan Minister arrived one after another to present their credentials. Soon, the new British Ambassador Sir Stevenson will also follow.</p>
<p>Nine years ago, Lushan brought us unity; today, we firmly believe that Lushan will make this unity more solid and permanent!</p>

<h3>Replaying a Tired Tune</h3>
<p>— Xi Ting</p>
<p>— Listening to music, learning music!</p>
<p>Whether rich or poor, everyone has things they wish were different; therefore, everyone has their own difficulties and sorrows. The only way to alleviate these troubles is through spiritual fulfillment, compensating for the imperfections of reality. This spiritual fulfillment isn't religion or moral concepts, but art. - Life cannot be separated from science, and especially not from art.</p>
<p>Art naturally isn't limited to music, but here, we're only referring to music. Music is the most abstract and direct of the arts, directly evoking resonance in the human heart. The music itself is merely the vibration of air, but this vibration directly touches people's eardrums and hearts. After you've listened to a march, if I ask you, "Did it resonate with you?" you might answer, "I didn't shout out." But I clearly saw your body swaying rhythmically as the symphony orchestra played the march, your feet tapping to the same beat, and your heart rate quickening.</p>
<p>— This is resonance. When you resonate, you leave all worldly troubles behind.</p>
<p>The time is now, the place is here. There are too many things making you sad. Continuing to be sad will lead to extreme nervous breakdowns, and there needs to be a remedy. I'm not advising everyone to escape reality or responsibility, but I believe that in Shanghai right now, mental hospitals are poorly equipped and expensive. It's not worth going to a hospital for mild mental illness, and most people don't have that habit anyway. The best method is to allow yourself to often be intoxicated, and let your nerves relax. That is, to listen to music or learn music. Music isn't medicine, and won't take effect immediately, but it's a type of nourishment. Long-term absorption can enrich your life.</p>
<p>In Shanghai, the only symphony orchestra (the Municipal Symphony Orchestra) has fixed performances twice a week. To cater to the audience's interests, the programs they play are very popular, so not many people find them unacceptable. Moreover, they invite people from all walks of life to their fixed practice times for free - why not listen?</p>
<p>In Shanghai, there are many places to rent pianos and find private music teachers. If you aren't living in extreme poverty, then taking time outside of school textbooks and formal work to study music is ideal!</p>
<p>When writing about music, it's hard to avoid old tunes, but there's still a need to replay those tunes!</p>
<h3>Future of the Publishing Industry</h3>
<p>— Wang Pingling</p>
<p>Advocating academics and revitalizing culture, though requiring freedom of thought and academic independence, still greatly needs the government's substantial promotion and planned advocacy. Even more, it needs sound and responsible cultural institutions and profound cultural policies, sparing no effort to serve the cultural sphere, uniting cultural workers nationwide under the banner of building a new China, aiming for directions that are one hundred percent beneficial to the nation's survival, and exerting the best effort. For example, the printing of scientific monographs, systematic translation of renowned foreign philosophical and literary works, planned compilation of scientific textbooks and collections, and large-scale distribution of popular science readings are not things that ordinary publishers can handle. The government must exert its full strength to take charge. Only by fostering a culture of scientific research, making scientific common knowledge a necessity for people's lives, can a profitable path be opened for the general publishing industry, shifting towards the promotion and printing of science. But today, we cannot but rely on the government.</p>
<p>To build a new China, we must have the newest wisdom and the most advanced scientific knowledge and technology. In the government's plans to promote academics, it must closely align with the needs of nation-building and execute its glorious mission. If it remains cautious, fearing the loss of national heritage, and only capable of preserving the quintessence of the nation, it is far from sufficient!</p>
<p>(4) Hopes for the Future</p>
<p>People living in darkness always feel that a hope shines like the sun overhead. Even if the sun's light is temporarily obscured by smog and becomes a pitch-black night, we believe that the shining sun will not disappear. Therefore, people have a kind of endurance, gritting their teeth and enduring all possible disasters, waiting for the smoke to clear and the light to come. I have always had such an unwavering belief, never pessimistic, always holding onto fervent hope, looking forward to a bright tomorrow. Similarly, I also believe that, although China's culture is currently in a post-war desolate wasteland, presenting unprecedented decline; although it is shrouded in dismal sorrow amidst the catastrophe of war having barely ended and turmoil erupting again, it is worth comforting ourselves that the young people of China, having been baptized by eight years of blood and fire, can distinguish between right and wrong, see clearly the straight and crooked, and recognize truth and falsehood. At least they will not blindly follow. They ask nothing of anyone, and therefore fear no one's repulsive face, and have some caution. They believe that the era of cannibalism is finally over, and they have the courage to rely on their own perception and conscience, after "looking at the goods and comparing the goods," to come up with impartial judgments. Once such impartial judgment exists in the hearts of ordinary people beyond self-interest, no matter how unconvinced, how jealous, or envious you are, and always think of framing and slandering those who have made outstanding achievements, it will be in vain. Because of this, future cultural undertakings will be openly presented on the stage under the scrutiny of all, to compete publicly. As long as you have "genuine goods," rest assured! They will never be buried! In the future, no matter whether they are clay sculptures, wood carvings, assembled... all kinds of idols have long been shattered by the iron whip of the great era, or have been remodeled into toilets for defilement, even if they are covered in brilliant gold; they will never confuse our vision again, and will never make you be threatened by their gold, and automatically dismiss "Yuan Long's boldness," and bow down to these remodeled toilets!</p>
<p>Today, no matter who you are, young people, old people, men, women, etc., as long as you are willing to devote your heart and soul to a certain field of knowledge or a certain undertaking, without being opportunistic or speculative, and can spend two-thirds of your life on it, I guarantee that you will have brilliant achievements; and these achievements will last as long as the earth. Only a heavenly calculation and earthly agreement can destroy your achievements. Such a great change in psychology, I believe, is the new motivation for building this new China, and not just a factor for the future prosperity of Chinese culture. But it's not easy to come by! You must know that this is all exchanged for by eight long years of bloody battles and the blood of twenty million people!</p>
<p>The current political turmoil naturally has some adverse effects on all aspects; but we cannot give up everything and wait for the desires of a few to be satisfied before we start doing the work we should be doing. Even if the political situation continues to be turbulent, we still have to live. We cannot drown or hang ourselves because their desires have not been fulfilled. Why can't we actively build in the clean land that they have not yet affected!</p>
<p>If we want to build, we naturally still hope that the ordinary people who "are not in the position do not plan its politics!" are willing to work hard and are able to move forward bravely in various tasks that should be changed and innovated, without any reliance. We don't need to worry too much about the people of today, only identify the work that must be done and has to be done, and work hard on our own.</p>
<p>In any case, China and the culturally developed United States have made some progress after a long period of fighting side by side. In the future, the number of readers will inevitably increase several times compared to before and during the war, perhaps due to the increase in living standards, forcing everyone to have some knowledge and skills as capital for survival.</p>
<p>This is undoubtedly the case; moreover, the textbooks and publications used by the enemy and puppets in the vast occupied areas to numb young people can no longer be allowed to poison people's minds. That said, relying solely on the books of a few publishers in the rear to meet the needs of the whole country after the war is, according to common sense, bound to be insufficient. If only political disputes cease and the world is at peace, the people's desire for knowledge will be as hungry and thirsty as, or even more so than, in the past May Fourth era; therefore, as long as the Chinese publishing industry manages itself well, it will certainly have a bright future!

<h3>The Little Wooden Shoes</h3>
<p>— Written by Lamartine, Translated by Xi Shou</p>
<p>We took the children to hike in the mountains, all the way to the highest points of the mountains that separate our deep valley and the Sha Na valley.</p>
<p>The mountain peaks stood one on top of the other, as if God's hand had kneaded them from flour. These mountains are covered with pine and beech trees, with yellow broom blooming in several places, like a gilded landscape painting. In addition to this, there are clusters of purple heather and light green meadows, with sheep the size of chickens whitening the grass. Sparkling small waterfalls can be seen everywhere, their waterways sandwiched between lush beech, chestnut, and willow screens, flowing from the mountains to the valleys.</p>
<p>From high up, we could see the White Ridge (Note) and the eternal white snow covering the entire Alpine range. My husband walked with the guard, while I rode on a donkey with the children, led by several teenagers who were our friends – the old parish councilor’s. He knew the trails, and he directed us along the way. It took three hours to reach the highest peak, but before, looking from my window, it seemed easy to climb, and only take half an hour. The distance in the mountains is just like time in life, often deceiving. However, the deception of time and the deception of distance are opposite; people think that those mountains are low, but in fact they are very high; people think that time is long, but in fact it is very short; time seems endless, but in an instant it has passed.</p>
<p>We and the children spent the whole day like this: walking a stretch, sitting on the grass for a while, gazing at the beautiful scenery, the midday bells echoing from the white hills in the Mai Song dairy village; in the White Lans village there are boundless meadows, like the landscape paintings that my brother, who was a secretary at the Dutch Embassy, ​​sent from there when we were young; the White Ridge changed colors according to the hours and the sun, sometimes white, sometimes rose, sometimes purple; like a piece of iron changing colors in a furnace, sometimes appearing white, sometimes red.</p>
<p>Our group, hosts and villagers alike, had a picnic on the grass. After the meal, we re-mounted our donkeys and returned along another path to the summit through a small path among the wild hazel trees.</p>
<p>The sound of donkey hooves striking the rocks, the children's cheers, and the gunfire of my husband and the guard shooting at red bamboo chickens frightened away the crows' cries. The conversations between the parish councilor and the teenagers created a great noise in front of our team, and people might have thought we were a band of robbers patrolling the mountains. Perhaps it was for this reason that we frightened the children who were watching sheep next to the hazel trees we passed.</p>
<p>After walking for a short while, we saw several groups of sheep without shepherds on an uncovered open space above the road, watched over by two black dogs. They barked at us in terror. Further away, we saw a pile of extinguished ashes between two large stones in the middle of the path, with two pairs of small wooden shoes next to them, which the children here wear. We immediately realized that those children, the children who came out of their thatched huts to watch the sheep, had not gone far from here. We guessed that they must have been frightened by the unusual human voices and gunshots coming from under the hazel trees. They probably hid hastily in the bushes, not having time to put on their wooden shoes. I wanted to give them an unexpected gift, and the children also thought this idea was very good. So, we hurried to the extinguished fire; my husband put a silver coin in each wooden shoe, and my daughters threw a handful of candied apricots into the wooden shoes. Then, we continued on our way, talking about the surprise and joy of the fleeing shepherds. When we had walked for a long time and no longer heard anything, they returned to the place where they had been guarding the sheep. When they put on their wooden shoes, they must have guessed that these things were given to them by the fairies who often came and went on this mountain, the fairies who lived in the night fog. As we walked down the gurgling puddle, our children laughed, imagining the shepherds' fear and surprise, guessing their joy, and what they would tell their mothers in the evening.</p>
<p>What we had imagined finally came true. When the two little shepherds went back to put on their wooden shoes, they found sweets and silver coins in the wooden shoes, and were puzzled, thinking it was a gift from the fairies. But their parents were not confused. They used all the clever methods of the villagers to repay the surprise we had given them, showing that they knew our kindness.</p>
<p>Early the next morning, when our servant opened the door to the courtyard without walls, he found four small baskets woven with straw cores next to the threshold outside the door, filled with hazelnuts, sheep cheese, and cream bread made into the shape of small wooden shoes. These must have been the children secretly placing their gifts and running away, just wanting to repay mystery with mystery, and gifts with gifts. This kind of anonymous, cleverly delivered small gift made us both happy and apprehensive. We really didn't know which thatched hut those children lived in, or who brought these timid – fearing to make a mistake with the object of thanks – things. But they would rather make a mistake than not give respect back.</p>
<p>How pure is this mutual respect between villagers and those called rich people, and it has moved the hearts of our children.</p>
<p>Note: White Ridge (Mont Blanc) is the highest peak of the European Alps. Lamartine's mother often went hiking in the mountains with her husband and children, and recorded her beautiful impressions when she returned. The above is a page from her son's travelogue.</p>
<h3>Listening Girl</h3>
<p>— By Gros (1725–1805)</p>
<p>Displayed in the London Wallace Art Gallery</p>
<p>Gros was the son of an unknown French painter, born in Donny, and later went to Paris. He enjoyed some fame for his historical works. At the age of thirty, he traveled to Italy, and after returning to his country, he produced many paintings related to Italian life. Gros's works are best known for depicting portraits of young girls, and this painting, "Listening Girl," is one of them. His portraits of girls contain a special fresh style, so it can almost be said that he has formed a kind of archetype. The paintings made by Gros mostly only cover the head and shoulders of the girls, and each painting is not only similar in appearance, but also similar in style and technique, although there are often many changes in body shape and color.</p>
<p>Although the girls painted by Gros all belong to the simple archetype of young girls, they are never described with simplicity; although they are all naive and innocent, they often reveal a kind of sensual charm and temptation, which is a major characteristic of the author. Gros was not famous during his lifetime, and ended his life in poverty in his later years.</p>
<h3>Night Letter</h3>
<p>— Yang Lianyuan</p>
<p>Your slender hands lightly pluck the seven strings of the zither, yet it has lost its rhyme. I imagine your heart contains endless sorrow.</p>
<p>Why is the melody of your seven strings so hurried, then suddenly so melancholic?</p>
<p>In the rain, at dusk, I am weakened.</p>
<p>I must tell you, I have just awakened from a harrowing dream.</p>
<p>That small town, it is like all other small towns, ancient, dilapidated, suffused with an atmosphere of melancholy. Please do not forget that it also preserves the unique simplicity of our country.</p>
<p>Now, I would like to use my clumsy brush to describe this small town:</p>
<p>I came to this small town from another small town, following the mountain stream, on a sailboat called a traffic boat.</p>
<p>In a hazy dream, I was awakened by a sharp conch shell sound, and when I woke up, I felt an icy cold wind coming towards me. Then I remembered the mood of idly gazing at the red leaves on the banks of the stream while leaning against the ship's railing yesterday, and a sense of late autumn desolation struck my heart again.</p>
<p>Does it feel desolate? No, that is the emotion that vagrants often have when stepping on a new land, intimate yet unfamiliar, feeling joy yet a slight emptiness.</p>
<p>I am standing on the sandy beach of the wharf. The Ling Mountains obstruct the view, and lush forests are mixed with bright red maple leaves. Mountains, majestic mountains, ah, I grew up in a country of mountains.</p>
<p>You can imagine that the mountain stream flows from the faraway mountain country, and when it passes through this small town, it is already on its way to the sea. The mountain stream usually sings her own melody with a gentle rhythm. You should know that at that time, the stream water is a deep blue, as blue as a transparent blue gemstone, but more vivid than a precious stone.</p>
<p>So I walked on the streets of the mountain town.</p>
<p>Some people say, "Poverty makes people selfish and suspicious," that's right, then you can imagine the residents of this small town hidden in the mountain country.</p>
<p>The residents of the small town are poor.</p>
<p>However, they still retain a simple temperament. It's very simple, their lives are not entirely built on the exploitation of people by people. Many residents have enough food for their families, food they cultivated with their own hands.</p>
<p>Their lives have a close connection with the land. The girls in this small town are really charming. Saying that, would you laugh at me for being shallow to the point of being bored?</p>
<p>I said that I stopped in this small town in the late autumn season. That year should have been the fifth year since the war began, and the situation on the front line was very tight. This small town could not avoid being affected. However, that year's winter, a harsh winter, finally passed. March in spring, the small town.</p>
<p>Thinking: houses surrounded by kudzu vines, dusk opens its black wings and surrounds this building, the peach blossoms in the courtyard close, their smiling petals, and the pond also has the breath of spring, slightly wrinkled by the evening breeze. The night travelers on the stone slab road outside walk lightly, as if they were carefully afraid of stepping on an ant, it is really quiet. At this time, you should find that the lingering red glow of the mountain is completely faded, and the twilight has completely subdued the western mountain. At this moment, I say that the tung oil lamp of that building should also be lit!</p>
<p>Yes! The oil lamp is lit, and it also makes a "crackling" sound. A melancholy child, a young girl, is faintly visible by the window.</p>
<p>She is eighteen years old, but this young life has so much suffering and endless sorrow. Alas, from her we also glimpse this small town; that is, the struggle of a new force being coerced by the old declining force.</p>
<p>This girl is melancholic, but even more charming.</p>
<p>When I say charming, I'm talking about her character. Through her beautiful appearance, I touch her beautiful soul even more.</p>
<p>She is like a piece of new earth, exuding the醇fragrant of mud, chaste, simple, endless praise, her slender hands lightly play a sad tune. Her tune has even caused the dusk of March in spring to exude an atmosphere of late autumn desolation. This girl is sad enough, her misfortune is also the misfortune of this small town, and the tragedy that comes with the war.</p>
<p>Alas, I said, I secretly listened to her playing the seven-string zither from the attic, and by the evening of the next day, we had become good friends:.......</p>
<p>The years of war are long, and in this difficult era, when the wild horses of emotion begin to run, we can still rein them in.</p>
<p>In those days, even if we had love for a certain place, undoubtedly, an enormous force controlled us. We shouldn't have any lingering thoughts about children!</p>
<p>March in spring, in the fifth year of the war, was our beginning, and also our end.</p>
<p>— So, you should understand my lingering feelings for that small town at this moment.</p>
<p>In a corner of the metropolis, that tune that evokes my sorrow comes again from the red foreign-style building across the window.</p>
<p>I should write something down; very tragically, that girl's life ended in a difficult childbirth, and later that small town continued to suffer from artificial wars and disasters.</p>
<p>To the young children of the same generation, I pour out my feelings, and we must also denounce the times!</p>
<p>Today, I write, line after line, beautiful souls, please listen to my voice.</p>
<p>"Weakened? For whom?" "For the fate of our generation!" you say, I am delighted.</p>
<p>But, this is just a dream.</p>
<p>(March 5, 15th, Shanghai).</p>

<h3>Reading</h3>
<p>— Shao Fu</p>
<p>The recession in the publishing industry has secondary effects on the economy, but the most serious crisis is the decline of public intelligence. It sounds like a joke to tell people that a best-selling book only sells two or three thousand copies, and magazines at most only reach around ten thousand copies. Why is this happening? Some say it is due to the weak purchasing power of readers. This is only a figure of speech; in fact, I absolutely do not believe it.</p>
<p>There is no need to cite other examples. When the Xingdong team is in Shanghai, the gate revenue per game is considerable, and the highest ticket prices sell for tens of thousands of dollars. How much do the tickets for Ma Lianliang and Mei Lanfang cost? Perhaps some will say that these are performances by famous players and famous actors, and are not examples to be taken seriously. Then, what about the daily revenue of dance halls, restaurants, and cinemas? It is difficult to establish the argument of weak purchasing power. To be honest, the people of Shanghai today would rather spend ten thousand dollars on a glass belt or seventy-five thousand dollars on a glass cigarette case than spend six hundred dollars on a copy of "Seeing and Hearing" or "News World," or eight thousand dollars on a copy of "Jean-Christophe." This is not a question of purchasing power; it is a question of not wanting to buy books and not wanting to read.</p>
<p>Let's not talk about the utilitarian view that reading is beneficial and that there are golden houses in books. Even in terms of recreation and entertainment, reading is the most economical and convenient method. At any time, any place, and in any form, you can seize the joy in books, and for a few thousand dollars, you can have several books, unlike dancing, where once you stop, you have nothing left, or like watching movies, where you leave the theater with nothing left. Therefore, reading is the most economical, convenient, and practical form of entertainment.</p>
<p>We intend to launch a reading movement, and we hope that everyone can take an hour or half an hour each day to read a few pages of a book, or even read two magazines. However, many things that promote obscenity, harbor pirates, spread rumors, and create trouble are not within the scope of what we should read.</p>
<h3>American Films in Shanghai: Miniature Films to Arrive in China</h3>
<p>— Yin Huai</p>
<p>"So far, Hollywood movies in China have only targeted a relatively small number of intellectuals in a few large cities, which is not enough." A Shanghai-based executive of an American film company recently told reporters: "Film is the best educational tool, making knowledge visual. During the recent war, it helped the U.S. government train a large army, reducing the time and expanding the effect. Its entertainment value is also extremely high; after a day's work, film brings great pleasure. Therefore, it should not belong only to a few noble urban people; it should penetrate the people, allowing millions of hardworking masses in the countryside to enjoy it together. Several of Hollywood's most progressive production companies have already decided to do so."</p>
<p>China's farmers account for more than 80% of the total population. Most of them are trapped in the shadows of ignorance, with no entertainment, only labor. It is quite touching that Hollywood is now paying attention to China's vast and uncared-for common people.</p>
<p>Their approach is to introduce the newly invented 16mm miniature films from the war period to China. Hollywood movies are usually in the large 35mm size. Because the projection equipment is heavy and the mobility is poor, it is not easy to spread them widely. Sixteen-millimeter films take up less space, and the projection machine is lighter and more convenient. It can penetrate the most remote villages. As long as there is a room and a few people gather, it can be screened immediately. At the same time, because it requires less electricity, it comes with a small generator, so there is no need to worry about the lack of power plants in rural areas.</p>
<p>Mandarin Dialogue</p>
<p>Are you afraid that farmers don't understand English? Hollywood filmmakers have already considered this point. They are preparing to dub all of them with Mandarin narration and dialogue, plus Chinese titles. This has already been revealed in the recent newsreels.</p>
<p>The 16mm films will include many educational and cultural short films, which should be quite effective in educating our farmers. But most of them will be abridged versions of ordinary 35mm films. Farmers will enjoy this eighth art at a lower price.</p>
<p>There are about a dozen Hollywood film merchants in Shanghai. The eight largest ones—RKO, MGM, United Artists, Universal, Columbia, 20th Century Fox, Warner Bros., and Paramount—have formed a film association to handle collective interests such as coordination and negotiation. Developing and promoting 16mm films is one of their agendas. Although some, like MGM and RKO, are said to have already shipped some of these films, there are at least two major difficulties in actual implementation.</p>
<p>There Are Also Difficulties</p>
<p>First, because the United States itself has an extreme need for 16mm projection machines, it is currently unable to export them in large quantities. Second, there are difficulties with imports through the Shanghai Customs. As early as March of this year, the Jianghai Customs implemented a new policy, stipulating that American film merchants are only allowed to import 60,000 meters of new film per quarter due to the lack of foreign exchange, regardless of the number of films. As a result, the New York headquarters of American film merchants are having a big headache. Should they import 35mm films for urban screenings, which are guaranteed to sell seats? Or should they import 16mm films that can only be screened in rural areas? (Because the United States stipulates that 16mm films can only be screened in places without 35mm cinema equipment.) Merchants will naturally not forget the foreign exchange income. They will certainly not import pleasing films for a good-sounding "empty name."</p>
<p>Their ultimate goal is still foreign exchange.</p>
<p>Good Income</p>
<p>Let's read their harvest figures. For example, "Arabian Nights" is said to have been screened for more than 60 days, with three screenings each day, and the ticket revenue is more than 10 million yuan. After deducting entertainment donations and business taxes, the net profit is about 6 million yuan. The split ratio between the film merchant and the theater is between 40% and 50%, that is, the film merchant can get 3 million yuan in legal tender. The net income for more than 60 days is close to 180 million yuan. Although it is only a meager amount of less than 90,000 U.S. dollars when converted into U.S. currency, it is still a considerable figure when combined.</p>
<p>Money is the prey that every merchant in the world eyes, and American film merchants are no exception. Another view of 16mm films can be annotated with this: the vast countryside is a virgin land yet to be cultivated, which may become their vast hunting ground. The restrictions of the customs can also explain that they want to control some of the leaked foreign exchange. And the educational value of movies is an undeniable fact. Therefore, it is not easy to decide who is right and who is wrong.</p>
<p>Since June 29, American films arriving in China have been actually subject to this restriction. The American film merchants in Shanghai (mainly the film association) are already in negotiations through the American consulate, and the New York headquarters have also discussed a compromise with our government through diplomatic channels. They proposed that the restriction should be based on the number of new films, so that the length and copies can be adjusted as needed. According to their estimate, each company can import 36 new films per quarter, with three copies of each new film, which can roughly meet the needs of the Chinese film market.</p>
<p>What happens next will have to wait for the next episode.</p>
<h3>China's Famine, Shanghai Holds Taoist Rituals</h3>
<p>— Xin Fang</p>
<p>The seventh month of the lunar calendar is here again, and the neighborhoods in Shanghai are initiating the Taiping Gong Jiao again. I feel that the authorities absolutely need to prohibit this kind of Taiping Gong Jiao ritual. All parts of China, and even the world, can be said to be experiencing famine. Shanghai is now suffering from a cholera epidemic. Many people are suffering from economic relations and cannot get reasonable medical treatment, so they lose their lives. Can we turn a blind eye to these things? Can the ghosts and gods protect us from getting an epidemic? In today's atomic age, I do not want another Chinese to believe in this kind of stupid act. I want to loudly shout to abolish the Taoist Ritual!</p>
<p>The Chinese have always had a tendency to worship superstition and ignore and not ask about the world. The reason why the custom of Taoist rituals cannot be broken is also largely because of this. However, the new China after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War absolutely does not allow such things as Taoist rituals anymore! After eight years of arduous war, the national social economy is on the verge of bankruptcy, and the spiritual or material losses of the people are uncountable. Who can say that the boring and ridiculous Taoist rituals should not be abolished?</p>
<h3>Tonight's Program at the Municipal Government's Amusement Park</h3>
<p>The Municipal Government Symphony Orchestra will hold a concert at Yiyuan tonight (August 3). The program includes famous pieces such as Tchaikovsky's "Waltz of the Flowers" and Puccini's "Madame Butterfly." Famous soprano Ms. Mao Aili has been specially invited to perform solo. Ms. Mao is a top student of Shanghai's famous teacher Professor Su Shilin. Tonight, Ms. Mao will collaborate with the orchestra to perform the aria "Tosca" from "Don Giovanni" and the romance from "Tosca" and other famous songs.</p>
<p>Tonight's program is as follows: Rossini's "William Tell" Overture, Tchaikovsky's "Waltz of the Flowers" from "The Nutcracker" ballet and his "Andante Cantabile" from his Fifth Symphony, Delibes' ballet music "Coppélia," Ms. Mao Aili's solo, Mozart's "Don Giovanni," Mascagni's "Cavalleria Rusticana," selections from Puccini's "Tosca" and selections from the opera "Madame Butterfly," and the march from the "Sigurd Jorsalfar" suite.</p>
<h3>The Inevitable Trend</h3>
<p>— Luo Ting</p>
<p>The fees charged by Shanghai schools are becoming more and more innovative and bizarre. In our school (a certain university in Pudong), the dormitory fees are divided into various grades starting next semester. The highest price is 24,000 yuan for rooms with windows on two sides and fresh air, and the lowest is 18,000 yuan for north-facing rooms, which get the northwest wind in winter and the scorching sun in summer. South-facing rooms are 20,000 yuan. This allows rights and obligations to be equal: good rooms have high prices, and bad rooms have low prices.</p>
<p>This is indeed very novel and very suitable for the atmosphere of Shanghai.</p>
<p>Everything is commodified, it's the inevitable trend, there is no way!</p>
<h3>Honeymooning Before Marriage: It's Okay in the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>— Zhang Tianyou</p>
<p>After reading Mr. Wu Jianhua's article "Grumbling," I couldn't help but feel something, so I'm saying a few words as well.</p>
<p>Mr. Wu was endlessly emotional because two male and female students under the age of twenty went on a honeymoon without getting married, and even called themselves "free" in court, saying, "How can they understand 'freedom'? It's a pity!" He also believes that marriage is still necessary, otherwise how can social organization be maintained?</p>
<p>Indeed, the marriage system is still necessary. However, there is indeed a country in the world where people honeymoon before marriage. If you don't believe me, that's the Soviet Union's marriage system. Now I'm copying some words from the third volume of "Traces in the Wind":</p>
<p>"Regarding the relationship between the sexes, the Soviet Union believes that this belongs to personal matters, so it does not interfere with trivial matters, but it pays serious attention to the happiness and protection of children. This key point can be said to be the mainstay of Soviet marriage law.</p>
<p>"In addition, there is another key point, which is that men and women are in a completely equal position in marriage law.</p>
<p>"In the Soviet Union, there is no need for any ceremony to get married. However, in order to protect the happiness and health of both parties and their children, if you want to register with the Civil Registry, you must comply with the following conditions:</p>
<p>1. Both men and women must be 18 years of age.</p>
<p>2. Both men and women must inform each other of their health conditions truthfully.</p>
<p>3. Both parties must agree to the marriage registration. (Points 4 and 5 omitted)</p>
<p>"According to Soviet law, cohabitation between men and women is de facto marriage. Not registering has the same effect. The only difference is that if a divorce occurs after registration, there are issues such as alimony and custody of children, and when the state has to come forward to preside over, there is evidence. Those who have not registered must first have the court identify that there is indeed evidence of marriage before they can take the certificate to the Civil Registry to register for divorce.</p>
<p>"Whether to register a marriage or not is up to the individual, because the relationship between the sexes is recognized as a personal matter. Unregistered marriages and registered marriages bear the same responsibilities. The point is to protect the interests of children and any party—especially women. So in the Soviet Union, terms such as 'adultery,' 'extramarital affairs,' and 'illegitimate children' simply do not exist."</p>
<p>From the above words, we can see that in the Soviet Union's marriage system, if these two male and female students were replaced by Soviet people, or lived in the Soviet Union, they would not be accused by their guardians.</p>
<h3>Comic Strip: The Adventures of Sanmao the Orphan Soldier (96)</h3>
<p>— By Zhang Leping</p>
<h3>Americanized Chinese Medicine (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Xu Guiting</p>
<p>The most effective medicine for coughs is cicada slough. It is said that cicadas chirp all day long when they are alive, so their lungs must be very strong.</p>
<p>The medicine for treating aphthous stomatitis is made by mixing the ash of a calcined insect with salt and apple slices. When taking it, it must be swallowed slowly to be effective.</p>
<p>American Friend's Report</p>
<p>The above is the American friend's report. Some of the proposed prescriptions are accurate, but some of them are so incredible that even we Chinese people dare not believe them. In short, the advertising by the old men or the over-exaggerations of our overseas Chinese medicine stores are a bit bizarre.</p>
<p>Before the Pacific War, that Chinese medicine store also sold "tiger bone wine" for US$1.75 a cup. Now, if you can buy it, a large bottle costs US$17.</p>
<p>Our "noble country's" pharmaceutical merchants often use a "we are the only ones" tone to promote to American friends: Our magical medicines sell because of their effects, and there is no need to study the reasons why they can heal. Unexpectedly, American friends' minds are too scientific. They actually have a group of people dedicated to studying Chinese medicine.</p>
<p>Arthur Maas, a professor of medicine at the University of Southern California, studied the components of ephedra and found that this herb does have the effect of adjusting and enhancing the circulatory system. The by-products of ephedra can also have the same effect on the adrenal glands.</p>
<p>This professor used to doubt whether tiger teeth could cure weakness, but recently he discovered that they contain unusually rich calcium phosphate. This is the same prescription that scientific medicine uses when treating patients with weakness. Using crab eyes to treat abdominal pain sounds absurd, but Professor Maas recently discovered that they contain calcium oxide. This is an effective medicine for treating excessive stomach acid.</p>
<p>There is also an ancient prescription for treating tuberculosis. Its ingredients are rumored as follows: Use a pig stomach, filled with the following ingredients: a pinch of soil facing north from a shrine, a bunch of grass growing in a place where the sun has never shone, a living small newt, a living toad, some fingernails, a few strands of hair, calcined yellow paper, and tea made with ginseng root. Put them all together, decoct them for several hours, and take them regularly, and there will be miraculous effects.</p>
<p>Dr. G. C. Basil, who used to be the director of the China branch of the St. Luke's Hospital in Chongqing, concluded based on his research that this prescription does have therapeutic value. His explanation is: soil contains silicates and other minerals, grass contains a large amount of vitamins, newts are rich in protein, fingernails contain calcium, paper ashes are carbon, which has the effect of suppressing the dirt in the stomach and intestines. Ginseng is used as a palliative. The components of pig stomach are recognized in modern medicine as a substance that specifically treats anemia.</p>
<p>Chinese Medicine is Also Scientific</p>
<p>Dr. Basil also said that donkey-hide gelatin does have the function of promoting blood circulation and contains important tonic ingredients.</p>
<p>Dr. Richard Frey, who served in the Eighth Route Army in China, stated at a rally in New York to support China: "As a result of analysis and clinical experience, we have found that many Chinese medicines are scientific, although most Chinese doctors cannot explain the scientific value of their treatment."</p>
<p>When the old man of the Chinese medicine store in New York became more and more enthusiastic when talking to Oppenheim, he said: "Penicillin is not uncommon. We Chinese have been using a kind of bacteria to treat leucorrhea and venereal diseases for hundreds of years, which is what is called using poison to fight poison. We know that Western doctors are surprised why we use sea dog kidneys as medicine. However, they now know that sea dog kidneys are most suitable for thiamine! We Chinese people have been using them for thousands of years and always know what is appropriate and what is not. Now white doctors are just beginning to tell us why Chinese medicines are so effective."</p>
<p>Here, what do countless Shanghai people who are crazy about Western medicine think about the discoveries of those American doctors? (End)</p>
