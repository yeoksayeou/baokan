<h3>爲善最樂，讀書便佳！</h3>
<p>今天是今年的立春日。一年之計在於春，一日之計在於寅。我們於今年立春的淸晨，願把兩句中國傳統勸人的老話，重新率獻於讀者大衆，那就是「爲善最樂，讀書便佳。」</p>
<p>中辦逢到新年，總是「恭喜新禧，」所謂新禧，就是新上快樂幸福國；即時舊時習尙，「恭喜發財，」也無非因爲發財是一件够快樂的事情。西洋人賀年，也必說一句HappyYear，一樣祝頌人家快樂。可見人生幸福，以快樂爲第一。不過快樂是大家所祈求，而怎樣纔可眞得快樂，却言人人殊了。發財固然可樂；但如只知聚財而不知所以散財，則發財的結果，或許弄到人爲財役，做了一世的守財奴，未必見得是快樂，而甚至反成爲心田苦惱的根苗。故眞快樂必非「發財」兩字所能簡單包括，而其如何以求眞正的快樂固別有其道。</p>
<p>推而言之，世界人類，林林總總，同是圓虧方趾，同具血肉靈與，以己之心，度人之心，我固然要快樂，人亦必要快樂，若但知求一己之快樂，而他人之快樂與吾非所問，於心安吾？於理得吾？孟子說，「獨樂樂不如與衆樂樂，」前者是私，而後者是公。求一己之樂，縱然如願，而同時耳聞目見，都是些窮而無告可憐可憫的事情，試問心裏怎麽能够快樂？何况天下事最怕不平，天道更忌圓滿，假使我們只求個人福分圓滿，坐視同時的人類顚連慘痛而無動於中，這樣的不平氣象，久而久之，會使得我們原本可以快樂者也得不到快樂。更何况今天的中國，勝利初臨，瘡痍滿目，如何善後，如何復興，小之一身一家·大之國家社會，正需要我們生聚敎育，加倍努力，也決非窮奢極侈快樂享福之時。故在今天要想過眞快樂的日子，只有大家撇開私心，趕緊想出方法來使得大家能够减少痛苦，分享快樂。換句話說，只有助人纔可快樂。助人愈多，則快樂愈多。</p>
<p>中國國民黨黨員守則第十條：「助人爲快樂之本。」這眞是度世金針·「助人」就是「爲善」，再演繹爲一句俗諺就是「做好事」。童子軍的信條，必須「日行一善」，也就是勉勵大家每天必得起碼做一件好事，做一件助人的事。孟子辨君子與小人之別，就是說君子是鷄鳴而起，孳孳爲善，而小人則學孳爲利。通俗些說，爲利只是爲我，爲善只是助人·我們要奉勸尋求快樂的人們，別要時時刻刻只想着自己，相反的必須隨時隨地關切他人的痛苦，帮助他人解決困難。惟有常常體念他人的痛苦，纔可覺得自己比上不足比下有餘，而不致爲物欲所累，心地自然光明。亦惟有常常救人之危，濟人之急，使他人的痛苦减少，快樂增多，而後自己淸夜反省，心安理得，無窮樂趣油然而生。所以「爲善最樂』這句古話，是不折不扣的正確。大家只知道尋快樂，却不肯從「爲善」上去努力，眞是比緣木求魚還危險，或竟不免如孟子所說「有後災」罷！</p>
<p>其次，要說到讀書。這裏所說讀書，不是讀死書，更不是勸人單爲做官或發財而讀書。人之所以必須讀書，理由很多，而最大的希望在乎明理。讀書而不能明理，與不讀書等，或且比不讀書還更壞·固然，學以致用，是我們讀書的目的，但如果不明白做人的道理，則縱有高深的學問，究竟何益於人類，何補於世界？中國國民黨黨員守則第十一條：「學問爲濟世之本」。讀書爲求學問，求學問爲濟世之用。所謂「世」，乃是人類的世界。世界之所以有今日，乃是人類學問的累積使然。我們受了歷代先聖先賢之賜，受了並世先知先覺之賜，生在這個世界，生在道個中國，我們應該怎樣報答纔可無愧？自然，我們也得各盡心力以求有所裨益於世界，這就是「濟世」；而欲求有所裨益，非得具備學問不可，非得深明道理不可，那就需要讀書了。所以讀書決不是爲做官，　也不是爲發財，乃是爲了要對世界有所盡力。這樣的讀書纔是佳事，所以說「讀書便佳</p>
<p>或以爲：對世界有所盡力，其道多端，何必續書？在古代，也許可以如此說，而爲非所以語於今日。現代的世界是科學的世界，是科學的羣衆時代。不論農工商隨，那一類工作不需要科學？那一類事業不需要學問？究極言之，那一類人不需要讀書？讀書的有發明，有進步；不讀書的，墨守舊法，坐待淘汰。人類文明的進步，已經到了一個各種事功非讀書求學不可的時代。而且，旣稱爲科學的羣衆時代，一個國家的文野，也就看國民讀書的成分多少以爲斷。若果只有少數人讀書而大多數爲文盲，這個國家科學必定還是落後，產業必定還是腐敗，那就絕不是一番「佳」氣象了。所以，我們不但希望自已讀書，自己」的子弟讀書，而且要推而廣之，希望大家讀書，希望家家戶戶的子弟都有護書的機會。文盲盡掃，通國讀書，這纔是大佳而特佳。</p>
<p>今年的春節，我們就拿「爲善最樂，讀書便佳」道兩句古話参獻於讀者，奉於國民，尤其要奉獻於席豐履厚的貴宦富翁之家，耶穌曾說，當人入天國，比駱駝穿針孔還難，這原不過是有激而談。我們却以爲「富而好禮，」並不是絕無僅有的事。當貴之家，所求的也不過快樂而已，也不過是佳事而已。而他們「爲善」之機會最多，爲善之能力也最强，只要他們動一善念，平民就受惠無窮。他們的子弟固不愁無書可讀，或且只愁有書而不願讀；可是一般大衆却要讀書而不可得，要求學問而無機會去求。因此，我們以爲上海市敎育會和本報等會同呼籲的勸募助學金運動，實在是富貴人家對快樂求佳事的方便之門。若周一星君移壓歲錢以助學，就是新春爲善的方便例子。希望諸公切莫錯過這個大好爲善的機會，切莫專讓自已的子弟有書讀，而眼看他家聰明俊秀的兒女坐失讀書的良機。「爲善最樂，讀書便佳。」願大家永遠毋忘！麥帥總部顧問　艾其森將返美</p>

<h3>改革票據背書手續　另訂新辦法　銀行公會正考慮中</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市金融界以往對票據背書付款手續，如担保票據背書，及蓋用「親收」「憑收」圖眾等習慣，於法木無根據，祗以積重難返，筧致奉行成習。茲者担保票據背書之習慣，已有財政部明令廢除，至其他關於票據處理手續，四聯總處亦已訂有辦法，均以適合票據法為原則，大後方早付實行，本市自應照辦。本市銀行業同業公會整理委員會有鑒於斯，曾委託銀行學會研究具體辦法。當經參照部令，及四聯總處辦法之原則，訂定「各行莊對於票據及　款收條收付處理辦法」，及「支票背書辦法」二種。按照該項辦法，其</p>
<p>重要規定有：（一）現用支票上載有受款人姓名或名稱者，不論「或來人」或「持票人」等字樣已否劃銷，皆為記名支票。其未載受款人之姓名或名稱者，不論「或來人」或「持票人」等字樣已否劃銷，皆為無記名支票，應以執票人為受款人。以後所印之支票，即不再印「或來人」或「持票人」等字樣。（二）付款行莊對於記名支票，受款人背書之真偽，及執票人是否本人，依法不負認定之責。以往代收行莊，關於担保背書之習慣，應予取消。（三）支票背書剛韋文字或簽名，務與抬頭</p>
<p>完全相符否則須由發票人將票面載入受款人加以更正，并須於更正處簽名或蓋章。此項劃時代之大改革，一反過去數十年之積習。現聞銀行公會正在考慮實行，中央銀行·交換所·錢業·信託公司·洋　銀行等，均將一致辦理。</p>

<h3>燈前絮語</h3>
<p>— 蘇丹</p>
<p>午夜黯淡的燈前，簫聲規律的響着時間的　音，而我是靜穆了。</p>
<p>雖然我有疲倦的眼睛，我卻在識着一封陳舊的信，誰會想到五年前一封陳舊的信我會在今夜重讀，為了這封信，為了說一句：深山野谷里艱苦的生活是不適合於女孩子的，只是這麼一句話，傷害了一位朋友的自尊，我失去了這位朋友真摯的友情，這又是誰會想得到的呢？</p>
<p>我是一個笨孩子，我該感謝這位朋友的直率，假如他不說，我不會知道自己使別人憤恨的地方，可是現在我知道了，卻又感到一些無言的悲哀，我的心漸漸的沉重了，我開始懂得了憂鬱。</p>
<p>為着一點細微的砂粒，便會在心靈上劃上一條永久的裂痕嗎？那末告訴我，人類是為愛而生抑是為恨而生的呢？雖然這樣的夜是清寒的，我以珍貴的回憶溫暖我，可是情感的反芻是一件痛苦的事，如今我咀嚼着昔日的感情了，讓自己的心受着往事的熬煎。</p>
<p>我并沒有將自己看得比別人尊貴，也沒有將別人看得比我低微，我不懂虛偽不懂謊，所以我沒有悔恨，我知道：要被別人了解同要了解別人一樣是不容易的事，人與人之間為什麼要障起一道無形的圍墻呢？</p>
<p>因為對一位朋友失去的容易，於是我感到獲得的難了，我惋惜失卻的真摯的友情，我認識這位朋友是在幼年的時候，年輕的孩子都有一顆純潔的心，沒有隴上一點虛假，唯有這時候，人與人之間的距離是最近的了，可是年華悄悄的流去，如今我才知道一句話也足以在別人心里留下一片陰影。</p>
<p>我說過我是沒有悔恨的，為的是我沒有輕蔑過一個朋友，不論是親近的抑是疏遠的，我相信Mlle　de　Scudery的話：只有友誼才是世間唯一無刺的玫瑰。友誼是需要以真誠來維繫的，我不希望一句善意的話，被誤解為譏誚，我珍惜着無刺的玫瑰，我敬愛的每一位友人。</p>
<p>為着一封陳舊的信，在這樣寒冬的季節里，深夜的燈下默默的寫下一些絮語，我感到一點寒冷，一點憂鬱了。</p>
<p>長夜有黎明的時候，寒冬有盡的時候，然而一次誤解呢？</p>
<h3>采薇圖記</h3>
<p>— 施翀鵬</p>
<p>吾師蕭屋泉先生，年八十餘，精神矍鑠，道貌岸然，擅書畫，尤工山水，海內知名，五十餘年，為當代藝壇繁泗，性耿介，甞執教兩江師範學堂，受知於何道州，與李瑞清，朱古微友善，筆畢之蒼勁渾厚，意境之深邃渺遠，非時下名家，所能望其背項。有正書局之清代畫史，譽為「畫追宋元，以造化為師，」良非虛語。先生嘗為曹慶楨與初昆仲作「采薇圖」橫卷，高尺許，橫二尺許，淺絳，山水作布景，人物二，氣宇軒昂，態度幽逸，伯夷扶筇，叔齊持览，顯盼山水之間，飄然不羣。隔岸青山隱隱，林木蔥籠，水聲潺潺，瀉出於兩峰之間，極為生動。放翁溪迴絲卷平堤水，林缺青分隔岸山之句，不啻為斯圖而詠。吾師以扛鼎之筆，寫此橫幅，大氣磅礴，遊刃有餘之勢，灼然可見。自題七絕一首，「一代清名屬大蕭，弟兄偕與古為徒；西山薇蕨猶能采，寫作夷齊第二圖。」蓋曹氏昆仲皆賜進士出身，翰林苑繡修，品格均極高尚，吾師引為知己，雖向不應題作畫，今乃欣然執筆，決非偶然，亦塵林佳話矣。</p>
<h3>理論與實踐</h3>
<p>— 中一</p>
<p>理論是實踐的方法，實踐是理論的目的，假使有理論而無實踐，則理論無異於一張空頭支票，假使有實踐而無理論，則實踐難免失之「漫無法則」旣無理論又無實踐，是故步自封，惟有正確的理論加上不屈不撓的實踐精神，才會產生圓滿的結果而促進不斷的進步。</p>
<p>我們可以注意到，人類所容易患的毛病，倒并非「有實踐而無理論」或是「旣無實踐又無理論」，而是「雖有理論與實踐，而并未將此二者合為一體」——換句話說，就是理論為理論，實踐為實踐；所實踐者旣非理論，而所理論者，更無被實踐的希望！於是，想進步就等於緣木而求魚！</p>
<p>舉幾個人人都觀察到的例子來說。電車裏「月台上不準站立」的字樣總看見過吧？在抬頭望見這幾個字的時候，大概總是你覺得頂擠得透不過氣的時候，但假使你有機會走進車廂深處的話，你卻會意外地發覺裏面倒相當寬舒。我們如果拿人口的密度來計算，月台上有時竟要超過車廂深處一倍以上。試想，「不準站立」的地方的密度超過「準許站立」并且「應該站立」的地方一倍，那末理論與實踐兩者間的距離，是不是夠遠了？</p>
<p>「禁止招貼」的牌子也是不挺陌生的。照例，「禁止招貼」的地方當然是不應該「招貼」的，但是你往往能發現「禁止招貼」的牌照附近「招貼」着很多的廣告。這些廣告的顏色都很鮮艷，紙張的面積都很大，因此，也就比「禁止招貼」的牌照本身要惹人注目得多了！</p>
<p>其次，凡是在小弄堂口寫着「不準小便，違者送捕」的地方，都是特設的露天廁所，還有門口掛着「戒煙所」的招牌而裏頭即是「燕子窠」等等例子，可說是不一而足！而且以上所舉出的，僅僅其淺而易見者，假如推及到較大較嚴重的事件，類似的例子也是普遍的存在着，不過這是要留待諸位親自去觀察，親自去想了。</p>

<h3>Northeast Soviet Army Delays Withdrawal; Reception Work Remains Stalled; Northeast Political Committee to Hold Regular Meetings</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Changchun, 2nd] Reception work in various departments of the Northeast is currently stalled, and the withdrawal of the Soviet army has also been delayed. The reasons are unknown. It is generally believed that Sino-Soviet diplomatic negotiations have entered a new phase, and the future development is of great concern to all parties. Although the stagnation of reception in various places is related to diplomacy, it cannot be regarded as a purely diplomatic issue. In areas where reception has not yet taken place, there are communist forces. They refuse central reception, citing the need to await the final results of the Political Consultative Conference. Due to the lack of information here, details of the Political Consultative Conference are largely unknown. Such waiting will inevitably prolong the time, so everyone hopes that the administrative authorities can find a clear solution to break this deadlock as soon as possible.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Peiping, 2nd] Dark clouds loom over the Northeast, and a clear outlook is unlikely in the short term. The Soviet army was originally scheduled to withdraw completely by Lunar New Year's Eve, but it has been indefinitely delayed due to inadequate preparations. The elite New Sixth Army has completed its landing. According to news received yesterday, the unit is advancing toward Goubangzi, and may soon be stationed in Shenyang and Changchun. People familiar with the situation in the Northeast pointed out to reporters that there are already over one million guerrilla troops in the Northeast, and the situation is extremely complex. Simply transferring some troops from within the passes and receiving some important towns from the Soviet army will likely not solve the whole problem. For now, it is impossible to go to Andong for reception, and there are also problems in Hailar, Xing'an Province. It is rumored that Mo Dehui suggested the establishment of a Northeast Mediation Executive Department; whether this is true remains to be seen. The Northeast Headquarters seems to be making every effort to strengthen its political lineup, announcing that the Northeast Political Committee, which has been under consideration for several months, will hold its first plenary committee meeting in Peiping before the 10th of this month. The notification is said to be issued soon. Xiong Shihui is the chairman of the committee, and the members include Mo Dehui, Zhu Qing, Wan Fulin, Ma Zhanshan, Zou Zuohua, Feng Yong, Zhang Zuoxiang, Wang Shuhan, Namuji, and Qingse Leng, totaling nine people. Regarding the progress of the Northeast industrial and mining issue, one of the personnel receiving the Fushun coal mine is said to be missing.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Chongqing, 3rd] 560 reception personnel from the nine provinces and two cities of the Northeast, who were staying in Chongqing, have been ordered to depart within days, as the situation in the Northeast has become clear. It is understood that China National Aviation Corporation has dispatched 14 passenger planes to transport all the reception personnel. Departure may take place today.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Chongqing, 3rd] In order to receive the grain agencies of the nine northeastern provinces, in addition to sending Liang Jingchun as a special commissioner to the Northeast, the Ministry of Food has recently sent seven more people to be responsible for receiving flour factories, soybean oil extraction plants, and grain processing plants. They are said to be waiting for a flight to Peiping and then to the Northeast.</p>
<h3>Program for Peaceful National Reconstruction (3)</h3>

(2) Assist returning overseas Chinese to return to their original places and facilitate their resumption of business. (3) Restore and assist the education and cultural undertakings of overseas Chinese in various places and provide scholarships to overseas Chinese children to study in China.</p>
<p>Addendum: (1) If there is disputed land in the recovered areas, the government of one party will temporarily maintain the status quo. If the National Government is reorganized, the matter will be resolved in accordance with Articles 6, 7, and 8 of the Political section of the governing program. (2) The local council, the Bar Association, and representatives of people's organizations will jointly form a People's Freedom Protection Committee. The expenses will be subsidized by the government. (3) The examination for citizenship oaths and public office candidates should be revised in accordance with the practices of democratic countries. (4) The Supreme Economic Commission established by the Executive Yuan should include civilian economic experts and experienced entrepreneurs as members of the commission to jointly plan and implement policies. (5) It is recommended that the government abolish the control of saltpeter and sulfur. (6) A. Investigate the workers of factories who moved from the downstream to the rear during the war and became unemployed due to the end of the war. The government will subsidize their severance expenses. B. The government should continue to purchase the finished products of factories that contributed to military equipment during the war, and appropriately purchase their equipment. (7) Amend the Publication Law, abolish the regulations on the registration and control of newspapers, magazines, and communications during extraordinary periods, the temporary regulations on the management of news agencies, magazines, film and broadcasting industries in recovered areas, and the regulations on drama and film censorship, and reduce the entertainment tax and stamp tax on movies, dramas, and music. (The End)</p>
<h3>Zhang Jia'ao Flies to Jinzhou, Will Transfer to Peiping and then to Chongqing</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Changchun, 2nd] Mr. Zhang Jia'ao flew to Jinzhou today to report everything to Director Xiong. Then he will transfer to Peiping and then go to Chongqing to report to Chairman Chiang and request instructions.</p>
<h3>Commander Cooke Arrives in Chongqing</h3>
<p>Meets with Chairman Chiang and Marshall [United Press, Chongqing, 2nd] Vice Admiral Cooke, Commander of the U.S. 7th Fleet, arrived here today and met with Chairman Chiang and Special Envoy Marshall. The content of the meeting was not disclosed by officials, but the transportation of the Central Army to the nine provinces of the Northeast and the training program of the Chinese Navy were all likely to be discussed. It is also said that the possibility of China allowing the United States to establish a naval base in Taiwan may also have been mentioned.</p>
<h3>Military Inspection Group to be Summoned and Dispatched Soon</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Chongqing, 3rd] The government will soon issue a notice for the military inspection group to convene a meeting to discuss preparations, and it may depart in the first ten days of this month. It is understood that the members of the group will discuss issues such as forming groups and going to various places to perform tasks during the meeting. It is rumored that group members such as Zhou Binglin may not be able to accompany the group due to being unable to spare the time.</p>
<h3>Veterans' Education and Accommodation</h3>
<p>Appropriate Measures Have Been Discussed</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanking, 3rd] Chongqing News: The authorities have discussed appropriate measures for the post-war education and accommodation of veterans. Experts have been hired to research and design the education and training plan for disabled veterans, with the goal of "being disabled but not useless." After the completion of training, the avenues are open to light and heavy industry, because today's amputees and blind veterans in Europe and the United States are able to work in important industrial plants due to the progress of training technology.</p>
<h3>Changchun Abolishes Lunar New Year</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Changchun, 2nd] Lunar New Year's Eve was spent in silence here. Most stores in the city have also closed since yesterday, and will continue to close for three days from the New Year. Changchun has been deserted and depressed for half a year. Although the stalls selling New Year's goods on Sima Road briefly created a lively atmosphere during the Lunar New Year, it was only a fleeting moment. Now the whole city is in a state of silence. Occasionally, two or three horse-drawn carriages with red paper couplets that say "May the horse and man be safe on a thousand-mile journey" can be seen, their wheel and hoof sounds mixing together on the snowy streets, almost the only sound to break the silence. In the Manchukuo Coal Building, where the headquarters and reception personnel live, some people went to the rooms of acquaintances in the morning to congratulate them, wishing each other a smooth reception.</p>

<h3>The Bizarre Kidnapping Case Masterminded by Kawashima Yoshiko: Nun Ando Details Her Kidnapping to Reporters</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 1st] Kawashima Yoshiko's arrest in China has not yet been resolved, and the bizarre kidnapping case she masterminded is about to come to light. The kidnapped victim is Nun Ando, a 67-year-old abbess of the Five Hundred Arhat Temple built by overseas Chinese in the suburbs of Tokyo, and Kawashima Yoshiko is said to be a Qing Dynasty princess. Ando told reporters from the Central News Agency that Kawashima Yoshiko visited the temple in early 1941 and became friends with her a few days later. Kawashima once asked her to accept her as a disciple, but she was rejected because she refused to shave her head, smoke, and drink. In July of the same year, Kawashima came to the temple again with Dr. Tsuchiya and a nurse, and forced Ando to inject her with a drug that caused her to lose consciousness. She was then placed in an asylum and treated like a madman. When she protested solemnly, Tsuchiya gave her another injection. Ando said, "I knew the injection was usually used to end a person's life," and Ando still walks unsteadily with a paralyzed left leg. She was released after living in the asylum for two months, but she was almost dead. During those two months, Kawashima Yoshiko presided over the temple and lived in it. Ando also said: "Until now, I still can't understand Kawashima's reason for kidnapping me. Now that Tsuchiya is dead, the only person who can explain this strange behavior is Kawashima alone." Ando continued, "Kawashima Yoshiko is very beautiful and extremely vain." Ando was formerly a famous actress in Tokyo and later became the concubine of Count Katsura Taro, the Japanese Prime Minister during the Russo-Japanese War.</p>

<h3>Doing Good is the Greatest Joy, Reading Books is the Best!</h3>
<p>Today is the Start of Spring of this year. The whole year's planning lies in spring, and the whole day's planning lies in the morning. On this Start of Spring morning of this year, we would like to sincerely offer two old Chinese sayings that advise people to our readers, which are "Doing Good is the Greatest Joy, Reading Books is the Best."</p>
<p>Whenever the New Year arrives, the central government always says, "Congratulations on the New Year," what is called New Year, is a newly established happy and prosperous nation; even the old custom of, "Congratulations on Getting Rich," is nothing more than because getting rich is a sufficiently happy thing. Westerners also say "Happy Year" when celebrating the New Year, also wishing people happiness. It can be seen that happiness is the most important thing in life. However, while happiness is what everyone seeks, the way to truly obtain happiness differs from person to person. Getting rich is certainly enjoyable; but if one only knows how to accumulate wealth and does not know how to distribute it, then the result of getting rich may lead to one being enslaved by wealth, becoming a miser for life, which may not necessarily be happiness, and may even become the root of suffering in one's heart. Therefore, true happiness cannot be simply encompassed by the two words "getting rich," and there is another way to seek true happiness.</p>
<p>Extending this further, all the world's people, of all kinds, are the same with round heads and square feet, all have flesh and blood and spiritual intelligence, using one's own heart to measure the hearts of others, I certainly want to be happy, and others must also want to be happy, if one only knows how to seek one's own happiness, and does not care about the happiness of others, can one feel at ease? Is this morally right? Mencius said, "Enjoying alone is not as good as enjoying with everyone," the former is selfish, while the latter is public. Seeking one's own happiness, even if it comes true, while at the same time hearing and seeing are all poor and helpless, pitiful and pitiable things, how can one's heart be happy? Moreover, the most fearful thing in the world is inequality, and Heaven hates completeness even more. If we only seek personal fulfillment and sit idly by while our fellow humans are suffering, unmoved, such an unequal situation, over time, will make it so that even those of us who could have been happy cannot be happy. Moreover, today's China, with the initial arrival of victory, is scarred and full of wounds, how to deal with the aftermath, how to revive, from the small self and family, to the large nation and society, we need to recuperate and educate, redouble our efforts, and it is definitely not the time to live extravagantly and enjoy happiness. Therefore, to live truly happy days today, the only way is for everyone to put aside selfishness and quickly think of ways to reduce everyone's suffering and share happiness. In other words, only helping others can bring happiness. The more you help others, the more happiness you will have.</p>
<p>Article 10 of the Code of Conduct for Members of the Chinese Kuomintang: "Helping others is the source of happiness." This is truly a golden needle for navigating the world. "Helping others" is "doing good," which can be further interpreted as the saying "doing good deeds." The Boy Scout oath requires "doing a good deed every day," which also encourages everyone to do at least one good deed every day, to do something to help others. Mencius distinguishes between gentlemen and petty men, saying that gentlemen rise at dawn and diligently do good, while petty men diligently seek profit. In simpler terms, seeking profit is only for oneself, while doing good is only helping others. We want to advise those who seek happiness, do not think only of themselves at all times, on the contrary, they must always care about the suffering of others and help others solve their difficulties. Only by often being mindful of the suffering of others can we feel that we are better than those below but not as good as those above, and not be burdened by material desires, and our hearts will naturally be bright. Only by often saving people from danger and helping people in need, reducing the suffering of others and increasing their happiness, can we then reflect on ourselves in the quiet of the night, feel at ease and justified, and endless joy will arise spontaneously. Therefore, the old saying "Doing Good is the Greatest Joy" is absolutely correct. Everyone only knows how to seek happiness, but is unwilling to make efforts to "do good," which is even more dangerous than climbing a tree to catch fish, or may even inevitably suffer "later disasters" as Mencius said!</p>
<p>Secondly, let's talk about reading. Reading here does not mean reading books blindly, nor does it encourage people to read books solely for the purpose of becoming officials or getting rich. There are many reasons why people must read books, and the greatest hope lies in understanding principles. Reading without understanding principles is the same as not reading, or even worse than not reading. Of course, applying what one has learned is the purpose of our reading, but if one does not understand the principles of being a person, then what is the benefit to mankind and the world, even with profound knowledge? Article 11 of the Code of Conduct for Members of the Chinese Kuomintang: "Knowledge is the foundation for helping the world." Reading is for seeking knowledge, and seeking knowledge is for the purpose of helping the world. The so-called "world" is the world of mankind. The reason why the world is what it is today is due to the accumulation of human knowledge. We have received the gifts of the wise sages of past generations, and the gifts of contemporary visionaries and enlightened individuals. Born into this world, born in this China, how should we repay them to be without shame? Naturally, we must also do our best to contribute to the world, which is "helping the world"; and to be able to contribute, we must possess knowledge, and we must deeply understand principles, which requires reading. Therefore, reading is definitely not for becoming an official, nor is it for getting rich, but for the purpose of contributing to the world. Such reading is a good thing, so it is said that "Reading Books is the Best."</p>
<p>Some may think: there are many ways to contribute to the world, why must one read books? In ancient times, perhaps one could say so, but it is not appropriate to say so today. The modern world is a world of science, a scientific mass era. Regardless of agriculture, industry, or commerce, what kind of work does not require science? What kind of career does not require knowledge? Ultimately speaking, what kind of person does not need to read books? Those who read books have inventions and progress; those who do not read books stick to old ways and wait to be eliminated. The progress of human civilization has reached an era where all kinds of achievements cannot be made without reading and studying. Moreover, since it is called a scientific mass era, the civilization of a country is judged by the proportion of the population that reads books. If only a few people read books and the majority are illiterate, then the science of this country must still be backward, and the industry must still be corrupt, which is definitely not a "good" scene. Therefore, we not only hope that we ourselves read books, that our children read books, but also extend this to hope that everyone reads books, and that the children of every household have the opportunity to protect books. Eliminating illiteracy and having the whole country read books is truly great and especially great.</p>
<p>This Spring Festival, we will present the two old sayings "Doing Good is the Greatest Joy, Reading Books is the Best" to our readers, to the people, and especially to the wealthy and influential families. Jesus once said that it is harder for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven than for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle, which was originally just an expression of anger. We believe that "rich and courteous" is not a unique occurrence. What wealthy families seek is nothing more than happiness, nothing more than good things. And they have the most opportunities to "do good," and the strongest ability to do good. As long as they have a good thought, the common people will benefit endlessly. Their children certainly do not worry about having no books to read, or perhaps only worry about having books but not wanting to read; but the general public wants to read but cannot, wants to seek knowledge but has no opportunity to seek it. Therefore, we believe that the fundraising campaign for student aid jointly called for by the Shanghai Education Association and this newspaper, etc., is a convenient door for wealthy people to seek happiness and good things. If Zhou Yixing uses his New Year's money to help students, it is a convenient example of doing good in the New Year. We hope that everyone will not miss this great opportunity to do good, and will not only let their own children have books to read, but also watch the clever and handsome children of other families miss the good opportunity to read. "Doing Good is the Greatest Joy, Reading Books is the Best." May everyone never forget! Advisor to MacArthur's Headquarters, Acheson, to Return to the US</p>

<h3>Reforming the Endorsement Procedures for Negotiable Instruments, Another New Method, the Bankers Association is Considering</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] In the past, the financial community of this city had habits such as endorsing negotiable instruments for guarantee and affixing seals with "received in person" and "received as payment" on receipts, which had no legal basis, but had become a common practice due to long-standing difficulty in changing them. Now, the habit of guaranteeing endorsements on negotiable instruments has been explicitly abolished by the Ministry of Finance. As for other procedures related to the handling of negotiable instruments, the Four Banks Joint Treasury has also formulated methods, all based on the principle of conforming to the Negotiable Instruments Law. The Greater Rear Area implemented them long ago, and this city should also follow suit. The Reorganization Committee of the Bankers Association of this city, in view of this, entrusted the Bankers' Association to study specific methods. After referring to the principles of the Ministry's order and the methods of the Four Banks Joint Treasury, it formulated two types: "Measures for the Receipt and Payment Handling of Negotiable Instruments and Payment Receipts by Various Banks and Firms" and "Measures for Endorsing Checks". According to these measures, the</p>
<p>important regulations include: (1) Checks currently in use that contain the name or title of the payee are considered registered checks, regardless of whether the words "or bearer" or "holder" have been crossed out. Checks that do not contain the name or title of the payee are considered unregistered checks, regardless of whether the words "or bearer" or "holder" have been crossed out, and the holder of the check should be considered the payee. Checks printed in the future will no longer include the words "or bearer" or "holder". (2) The paying bank or firm is not legally responsible for verifying the authenticity of the payee's endorsement on a registered check, or whether the holder of the check is the payee himself. The habit of guaranteeing endorsements by collecting banks in the past should be abolished. (3) The text or signature of the check endorsement must</p>
<p>completely match the payee's name on the check, otherwise the issuer must correct the payee's name on the face of the check and sign or seal at the correction site. This era-defining reform reverses the accumulated habits of the past several decades. It is now heard that the Bankers Association is considering implementing it, and the Central Bank, Exchange, Money Shops, Trust Companies, and Foreign Banks will all handle it in unison.</p>

The remaining one-third are corps members of the various sub-groups under the branch corps. The camp adopts a military management system, and the young people undergoing training are organized into a large team. The training curriculum focuses on recreational activities, and also includes lectures on political corps affairs, to supplement the deficiencies of school education. The time is set for two weeks. The director is concurrently held by Wu Shaoshu, the director of the branch corps, and the deputy directors are Wang Weijun and Xie Dahuang. The Shanghai, Nanjing, and Jiangsu branches of the corps will hold a joint meeting in Nanjing on the 10th. Each branch will send ten people, including cadre team leaders, to participate.

<p>Although I have weary eyes, I am reading an old letter. Who would have thought that I would reread a five-year-old letter tonight? For the sake of this letter, to say just one sentence: a hard life in deep mountains and valleys is not suitable for girls. Just this one sentence hurt a friend's self-esteem, and I lost this friend's sincere friendship. Who would have imagined that?</p>
<p>I am a clumsy child. I should thank this friend for their frankness. If they hadn't said it, I wouldn't have known that I had made others resentful. But now that I know, I feel some unspeakable sadness. My heart gradually becomes heavy, and I begin to understand melancholy.</p>
<p>Can a tiny grain of sand leave a permanent crack on the soul? Then tell me, are humans born for love or for hate? Although the night is chilly, I warm myself with precious memories, but the rumination of emotions is a painful thing. Now I am chewing on past feelings, letting my heart suffer the torment of bygone events.</p>
<p>I have never considered myself more noble than others, nor have I considered others lower than myself. I do not understand hypocrisy or lies, so I have no regrets. I know that being understood by others is as difficult as understanding others. Why do people build an invisible wall between themselves?</p>
<p>Because it is easy to lose a friend, I feel how difficult it is to gain one. I regret the loss of sincere friendship. I met this friend in my childhood. Young children all have pure hearts, without a trace of falsehood. Only at this time is the distance between people the closest. But time quietly flows away, and now I know that a single sentence can leave a shadow in someone's heart.</p>
<p>I said that I have no regrets because I have never despised a friend, whether close or distant. I believe Mlle de Scudery's words: only friendship is the only thornless rose in the world. Friendship needs to be maintained with sincerity. I do not wish that a kind word is misunderstood as ridicule. I cherish the thornless rose, and I respect every one of my friends.</p>
<p>Because of an old letter, in this cold winter season, under the lamp late at night, I silently write down some whispers. I feel a little cold and a little melancholy.</p>
<p>Long nights have dawn, and cold winters have an end, but what about a misunderstanding?</p>
<h3>A Record of the Gathering Ferns Painting</h3>
<p>— Shi Chongpeng</p>
<p>My teacher, Mr. Xiao Wuquan, is over eighty years old, full of vigor, with a dignified appearance. He is skilled in calligraphy and painting, especially in landscape painting, and is well-known at home and abroad. For more than fifty years, he has thrived in the contemporary art scene. He is of upright character and once taught at Liangjiang Normal School, where he was appreciated by He Daozhou and was close friends with Li Ruiqing and Zhu Guwei. His brushstrokes are vigorous and profound, and the artistic conception is deep and distant, which cannot be matched by today's famous artists. The Qing Dynasty Painting History published by Youzheng Bookstore praises him as "his paintings pursue the Song and Yuan Dynasties, taking nature as his teacher," which is by no means an exaggeration. Mr. Xiao once created a horizontal scroll painting titled "Gathering Ferns" for the Cao Qingzhen brothers. It is about one foot high and two feet wide, painted in light ochre. The landscape serves as the background, and there are two figures, dignified in bearing and elegant in demeanor. Boyi leans on a cane, and Shuqi holds a basket, gazing between the mountains and rivers, detached from the crowd. Across the bank, the green hills are faintly visible, the trees are lush, and the sound of water gurgles, cascading between the two peaks, which is extremely vivid. Lu You's lines, "The stream turns, the silk reels the flat dyke water, the forest lacks, the green separates the distant mountains," seem to be written for this painting. My teacher uses his masterful brush to write this horizontal scroll, and the grand momentum and skillful ease are clearly visible. He inscribed a seven-character quatrain on it, "A generation of pure reputation belongs to the Da Xiao, the brothers follow the ancients as their teachers; the ferns of the Western Mountains can still be gathered, writing the second picture of Yi and Qi." It is said that the Cao brothers were both granted the title of Jinshi and served as editors in the Hanlin Academy, and their character was extremely noble. My teacher regarded them as confidants. Although he usually did not inscribe poems on paintings, he now happily took up the brush, which was by no means accidental and is also a beautiful story in the art world.</p>
<h3>Theory and Practice</h3>
<p>— Zhongyi</p>
<p>Theory is the method of practice, and practice is the purpose of theory. If there is theory without practice, then theory is no different from a bounced check. If there is practice without theory, then practice will inevitably lack "any method or rules." Without both theory and practice, one is stuck in their ways. Only correct theory combined with an indomitable spirit of practice can produce satisfactory results and promote continuous progress.</p>
<p>We can notice that the most common problem that humans suffer from is not "having practice without theory" or "having neither practice nor theory," but rather "having both theory and practice, but failing to integrate the two into one" – in other words, theory is theory, and practice is practice; what is practiced is not theory, and what is theorized has no hope of being practiced! Therefore, wanting to progress is like climbing a tree to catch a fish!</p>
<p>Let's take a few examples that everyone has observed. You must have seen the words "Standing on the platform is prohibited" on the tram. Usually, you see these words when you feel extremely crowded, but if you have the opportunity to go deep into the carriage, you will be surprised to find that it is quite spacious inside. If we calculate the population density, the platform sometimes exceeds the depth of the carriage by more than double. Just imagine, the density of the place where "standing is prohibited" exceeds the density of the place where "standing is permitted" and "should be standing" by double, then isn't the distance between theory and practice far enough?</p>
<p>"No posting" signs are also quite familiar. As a rule, "no posting" should mean no "posting," but you can often find many advertisements "posted" near the "no posting" signs. The colors of these advertisements are very bright, and the area of the paper is very large, so they are much more eye-catching than the "no posting" signs themselves!</p>
<p>Furthermore, places where "No urination, offenders will be arrested" are written at the entrance of small alleys are often specially set-up open-air toilets. There are also examples such as "smoking cessation centers" with signs hanging outside, while inside they are "dens of pleasure," and so on! Moreover, the above are just shallow and easily visible examples. If we extend it to larger and more serious events, similar examples are also commonly found, but this is left for you to observe and think about for yourselves.</p>
