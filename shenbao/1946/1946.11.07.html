<h3>調人提出具體建議　如雙方同意和談可重開　司徒雷晉謁主席長談</h3>
<p>〔本報南京六日電〕非正式綜合會談，對政治問題商談有成就時，即再召開政協綜合小組及憲草審議會予以通過，此項建議係六日上午民盟·靑年黨·社會賢達集會三小時所決定者。下午即由羅隆基等訪周恩來吿知此項建議，並報吿政府，具有重開和談決心。晚莫德惠再訪雷震及邵力子，正式提出此項意見，政府代表決定七日上午在孫科寓討論答案，並將着重於盡草問題。</p>
<p>〔本報南京六日電〕國大開幕在即，和談局勢連日張弛不定，亦已漸近於圖窮七現之時。據悉，調人方面綜合近日商洽結果，已獲致一具體建議，經六日下午商定後，已向政府方面提出，倘獲同意，須共產黨無異議時，則正式商談可能自七日起即可舉行，將儘最近期內商定一切。在調人方面，原擬就政治軍事兩方面所列問題，分別與政府及共產黨進行商談，嗣爲時間經濟及減少奔走之勞，商談方式即由各方會同一時舉行非正式綜合會談及軍事三人小組，分別談商政治軍事各問題，並聞所擬商談問題，將爲下列各項：「政治」：（一）國府與政院改組問題；（二）國大各方面名額名單問題及國大實際議事開始日期；（三）憲草問題；（四）關內外地方政權問題。「軍事」：（一）就地停戰問題；（二）駐軍地點問題；（三）執行小組分別執行停戰問題。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京六日電〕政府方面對第三方面之意見，今晨由部力子代表提出答復，原定下午三時召集之會議，臨時取消。民盟代表張君勱，今上午七時又訪邵氏會談。政協秘書長雷震在座，邵氏當表達政府方面之意見，不拒絕商談，但希望第三方面對於商談之方式與程序，提出更具體之辦法。</p>
<p>〔本報南京六日電〕孫科七日晨可自滬返京，梁漱溟六日八時離京飛平。李璜·左舜生·陳啓天六日晨日滬返京。</p>
<p>〔本報南京六日電〕馬司於六日晨，一度會見，下午六時司徒晋謁主席長談。</p>
<p>大局發展關鍵決定在數日間</p>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕第三方面某氏，日前自京返滬，六日語記者：大局和平發展之關鍵，決定在最近數日間，各方面在京交換意見之內容，側重兩點：（一）政府提示之八項原則，（二）行政院改組問題。前者第（一）（二）兩項，政府與中共已談有成議，僅未簽字，第（三）（四）（六）三項政府已接受第三方面意見，表示可予考慮修正，雙方意見距離亦不難接近，第（五）（七）兩項，爲應經之程序，無庸討論，第（八）項俟前七項解決後，亦自不成問題，故政府所提之八項原則，在商談時，幷無困難。至於後者，政府主張在國大開會後，再行改組杆政院，中共堅持必須與國府同時改組，則亦僅爲時間上之問題，果能雙方略子變通，亦似無必須爭執之理由。準此以觀，目前距離國大會期雖僅數日，大局和平之望，仍極榮觀，故第三方面始終在積極　旋，希望促成國大之圓滿揭幕。</p>
<p>此外關於憲草中所爭執之兩點：（一）行政院對立法院負責間題。（二）地方政權間題。本年四月前，政協憲草審議會開會時，對於前者，政府主張取消，中共堅主保留，最後曾有一折衷意見，即行政院僅在某種範圍內，對立法院負責，係有限的負責，而非一般的負責，如再略加商討，即可獲得一綜合意見，對於後者僅需在條文上略加調整。並無重大出入，憲草審議會如能速開，則商定憲法草案，亦不致化費甚多之時間。</p>
<p>又改組政府，各黨派委員名額之分配，中共與民盟原要求十叫席，最近亦表示可以考慮變通，惟此次各方面非正式交換意見，迄今未能獲得圓滿結果，癥結所在，仍不無其他因素，此後最緊要者，厥爲各方表現誠意，互相讓步，不節外生枝，爭取時間，則圓滿召開國大，完成和平統一，實不難促其實現。</p>

<p>答：余未聞足以顯示宋院長意擬請辭職之情形，國民大會開會後，自可期待行政院更加擴大基礎，張羣主席，現任政府極重要職務，前因醫治頸瘤赴美，今于術成功，其健康已容許其早日返國。</p>
<h3>邵力子談話</h3>
<p>〔本報南京六日電〕國大籌委會新公布職員名單，邵力子仍爲主委，記者以邵前曾有辭意，六日訪邵，詢辭意是否打消，據答：本人因體弱，時感頭痛，國大籌備工作至爲繁重，深懼不能勝任，故誠懇請求辭職，幸實際事務向由秘書長洪蘭友負責，相信不至貽誤。艷者又詢邵氏對國大意見？據答：制定憲法與和平團結至有關係，吾人原冀在和平團結吿成後召開國大，現時仍希望，能以召開國大，促進和平團結之成功，目的並未變更，祇待繼續努力。</p>

<h3>全國商聯會通過　臨時重要動議案　請政府速確定經濟政策</h3>
<p>〔本報南京六日電〕全國商聯會今日通過如下之重要臨時動議：</p>
<p>案由：請政府從速確定經濟政策，改善金融措施，務須以保護生產，發展貿易及安定民生爲中心，藉　挽救全國工商危機案。</p>
<p>査目前我國經濟矛盾百出，工商困機日趨嚴重，究其癥結之所在不外乎下列諸端。</p>
<p>一·因通貨膨脹，生產萎縮以及運輸梗阻引起高物價，又因高物價造成高利貸，目前全國各地工商業俱受高利貸之壓迫，飲鴆止渴。倒閉時聞。</p>
<p>二·因勝利以來輸入激增，舶來品傾銷各地市塲，國內幼稚工業製品，難與競爭，以致原有國內市塲爲外貨所攘奪，營業蕭條，維持困難。</p>
<p>三·因法幣國內價値與國外價値相達懸殊，特產　出不敷成本，以致絲，茶，桐油，畜產等業俱受影響，農產陷於呆滯，經濟灝於破產，購買力萎縮，以致都市商品銷路日隘。</p>
<p>四·因目前金融政策注重收縮，信用對於眞正從事生產之貸款，亦限制甚嚴，且土地不能作押，廠房不能作抵，而且重重管制，雖號稱專業銀行之中交農亦動受限制商業銀行，則因中央銀行始終未嘗切實辦理重貼現轉抵押，轉週不易愼求自保，以致金融與生產失去聯繫成爲脫節狀態。</p>
<p>五·因游資逃入黑市，銀行爲保持成本之减輕，所定存款利率過低，與借息相較成爲一與十之比，更使社會游資不願存入銀行流向黑市，羣趨投機市塲，不但妨碍金融抑且助長投機市塲之畸形發展。</p>
<p>六·因捐稅繁重，不願工商業負担能力，不知培養稅源，專事殺鷄求卵，竭澤而漁，攤派借徵，惟求比額之增加，膏血枯竭，奄奄一息。終至停工歇業。</p>
<p>上述種種，俱係由於抗戰復員以來，迄無確定之經濟政策作爲南針，又金融措施，不從扶助生產着手，專事盲目緊縮，有以致之，其補救之辦法，應請政府垂念民力殆盡，正視當前危機，從速確定經濟政策，並改善金融措施，務使金融與經濟發生聯擊，藉以保護產業，發展貿易，俾達挽救危機，安定民生之目的，其有不合現時代需要之非常時期，與戰時經濟法令槪宜廢止，茲將各種辦法述其綱要如左：</p>
<p>一，關於確立經濟政策者</p>
<p>甲，生產爲一切經濟活動之母，有大量之生產，然後有鉅額之貿易與　富之分配及消費，抑且政府之財源，亦唯依賴於生產之旺盛，而後歲入可獲健全之增益。故我國之經濟政策，應以保育，並發展生產爲其中心目標。</p>
<p>乙，生產之要素爲資金，勞動與技術·設備·組織與管理，我國產業幼稚，資金短絀，技術落後，設備簡陋，組織與管理亦不甚嚴密。欲發展生產，預先求蓋礎良好，故第一步、政府應督導並切實援助民問產業之漸行充實與改進，特別在資金方面應全力予以便利。</p>
<p>丙，幼稚工業，絕對不能遭受外來產品之傾銷打擊，爲保育必要之民族工業，保護關稅，務須建立，切不可因欲敷衍友邦而致自掘墳墓。</p>
<p>丁，國營事業與民營事業之劃分，經依照經濟建設計劃，速行劃分公佈，明定種類示民以倌，分別緩急積極進行。</p>
<p>戊，股息之分配，應規定不得低於銀行貨息之百分之五十（年終結損當然例外）籍以鼓　投資，又工資之計算，應由政府規定最低工資，其限度不可超過資方之負担力，俾勞資雙方兩得其平。（下文轉入第二版）</p>

<h3>全國商聯圓滿閉幕　蔣主席親臨致訓　政府決全力爲工商界解決困難　盼工商界能協助政府發展交通</h3>
<p>〔本報南京六日電〕全國商聯會開會五日後，已於六日圓滿閉幕。蔣主席並於下午四時一刻蒞會致訓。昭示政府對工商痛苦，殊爲關切，決盡全力協助，解決困難。對稅務問題，盼商界能協助政府，使統計調査得以確實，此一工作，若能辦到，徵稅自得平衡。在交通復員方面，亦盼能助政府使其得以發展。主席今日穿黃呢制服，精神健吒，而色紅潤，蒞臨後，先在休息室小憩，由王曉籟面陳會議經過及各地代表對政府期望之點，旋由谷正綱陪同進入會塲，全塲報以熱烈鼓掌。登台後，由王曉籟面陳令體致敬之意，並報吿大會報到者共四一六人，實到三〇一人，提案共五〇四件。繼由主席致訓，略謂：</p>
<p>抗戰勝利後，不但我國經濟工商落後，一般人民感受痛苦，他國人民固亦有相同情形，惟我國特別痛苦而已，而其中尤以各地工商業及人民受苦爲深；其他國家經一年時間，在經濟上大槪已有一頭緒，經濟及交通成見恢復，獨我國因種種關係，交通迄未復原，農工商受苦亦深，此種情形，爲其他國家所無者，政府感於對同胞及工商界所負之重，殊感惶恐，今後決盡力，减除工商痛苦，减除全國同胞痛苦，盼全國經濟界，尤其是諸位遠道而來之領袖，能與各地政府同心協力，通力合作，使經濟能迅速恢復，交通能日見復原，工商能日見好轉。交通重要殊甚，盼各位能特別幫助，使鐵路公路能以發展。其次，我工商基礎不能與各地相比，最大原因，爲我組織不健全，缺乏統計，各種經濟不能有一進步與具體之計劃，俾按步就班而進。此外，調査不確實，租稅因之不能求得其平，欲求工商健全發展，租稅應求其平衡與不偏，商民痛苦亦得藉以减少。現調査不實，統計不確，致富而應納者得以不繳，不應出者反受納稅之苦，此事已飭經濟社會兩部特別注意，惟仍盼社會能自動在調査上協助政府，統計與調査皆能確實後，商人之痛苦定可减少（熱烈鼓掌）。此水最爲重要，爲建國之根本問題，亦爲工商自謀發展進步與健全最緊要之事，希望能特別協助政府，使其很快能有一全國性的切實的統計。此次大會通過提案多起，余代表政府吿訴諸位，政府一定本諸位所提，盡量减少全國工商界痛苦，並解決工商界目前重要問題（熱烈鼓掌）。</p>
<p>詞畢，由浙代表陳勤士（果夫先生尊翁亦爲會中年事最長之代表）面達請願書兩通，其一爲請政府從速確定經濟政策，挽救全國工商危機請願書，另一爲關於稅務者。大會請求三點：（一）請主席明令豁免三十四年度所利得稅，（二）永遠免征糧食營業稅，（三）嚴懲不良之稅務人員。主席接受後，連聲稱好，下午四時半許，於熱烈鼓堂中離會。</p>
<p>〔本報南京六日電〕全商聯八時舉行閉幕式。到政府首長潘序倫及全體代表。行禮如儀後，主席王曉籟致詞，謂此次討論提案共五〇四件，以後將分別處理，以解決工商痛苦，解除危機，並協助政府經濟建設，完成建國大業，盼各代表協力同心，完成使命。潘序倫致詞，謂：大會提案對國家社會及商業貢獻殊大，與經濟部有關者當予細心硏究，並竭力協助解決，以推進工商業，共達經建目標。繼請組織部陳部長代表及社部陸司長京士致詞，最後由寗夏代表喬森榮致答，大會於悠揚樂聲中宣告散會。</p>
<h3>昨通過之要案　請求政府免征所利得稅　制止日船擅入內河行駛</h3>
<p>〔本報南京六日電〕全國商聯會六日晨第六次大會，繼續討論提案。討論捐稅時，各地代表對請求免征所利得稅，發言殊踴躍，僉認此事若不能辦到，大會解除工商困難之任務即未達到，代表此來亦屬虛負此行，且無以報各該地人民付託之重，要求大會向政府懇切提出，並向蔣主席陳訴，務期能達到目的。若干代表甚至建議在政府未作滿意答覆前，暫停繳納。今日最先討論者爲金融案八十一件，大部順利通過，惟討論至經濟部交議之發揮商業團體高度自動精神，自動平抑物價案時，寗夏代表起立發言謂：痛人皆願物價穩定，目前物價高漲，皆由於政府國營公用事業漲價所引起，經濟部不管本身之中紡公司紗價上漲，而令商人平價，不知如何平法，我人並非奸商，力量薄弱，自惟有隨政府所定價格而漲落。陳詞激烈，博得掌聲不少。有關工商組織提案共七十四件，主要者爲設立中國商聯銀行，及請中央於全國商聯會出席之五十一單位中，每一單位各增國大代表一人，及請交通部嚴令制止日船非經許可不得擅入內河行駛等三案。大會對兵役問題，亦有重要決議，主要爲征兵時應向被征人之往所地征集爲原則。下午討論臨時動議，最要者爲王秉鈞及各省市代表王曉籟等九十一人提請政府從速確定經濟政策，改善金融措施，務須以保護生產發展貿塲及安定民生爲中心，藉謀挽救全國工商危機案滬市商會所提爲挽救各業危機，應請政府賦予資方自由調整職工案，原則通過。詳細辦法，留交理事會討論。該會所提另一案，請放寬國產紗布南運辦法，以利生產案，決議請經濟部撤銷紗布南運禁令。</p>

<h3>黃河復堤總工程師　塔德談治河近況　至少尙需三四個月始可完工</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕聯總黃河堵口復堤總工程師塔德，於昨日下午招待記者時稱：民國二十七年時，國軍因戰略關係，曾在鄭州花園口附近，決河制敵，豫皖省境，農田之彼淹者達二百萬畝。去年十二月，塔氏正供職於美軍工程部，聯總乃邀其來華，主持修復黃河工程。按塔氏爲河防專家，早在民國八年，即曾來華參加運河修堤之工作，其後即專硏黃河問題，民國三十年時，並曾因其對黃河問題之著作，而得美國土木工程帥　之勞侖獎金（Rowland　Prize），主持黃河復堤工程，實爲最理想之人選也。</p>
<p>工程延緩原因</p>
<p>塔氏稱：中國致府曾對聯總表示，如黃河復堤工程能及早完成，則一年內產麥量可增加一百萬噸以上，故聯總督促甚力，塔氏亦即啓程來華，欣然重見闊別十餘年之黃河。工程係於三月一日正式開始，本擬趕在本年六月底夏汛前完工，四五六三個月內，工作進行頗爲順利，惟以聯總治河用具未能準時遝到，常地工料亦嫌不足，加以政府要求保證遝輸此項重量頗巨之物資時，不得損傷鐵路，而中共又因黃河改至新道後，舊道（十分之九在中共控制區內）中已有居民的二十五萬人，復道時勢必流離失所，要求聯總先爲彼等妥謀救濟，因此種種原因，工程遂致延緩。六月二十八日，黃汛開始，冲毁鐵道，大部工作不得不吿停頓。</p>
<p>十月下旬，水勢已退，故工作已於十一月初恢復，國府並已限令黃河水利委員會於一月五日前全部完工。惟察塔氏語氣，彼實以爲限期過促，據彼之估計，現此項工程雖已加緊進行，但至少尙需時三四個月。</p>
<p>治河困難所在</p>
<p>塔氏稱：治河之困難，在於工程包括政府及中共控制之區域；中共控制區內之復堤工程，目前已完成百分之八十，該區內河工所得之工資，與河南省府境內河工之工資完全相同。本年七月中，周恩來·蔣廷黻·及聯總普拉斯等曾集議四次，商談舊道內二十五萬居民之救濟問題，彼時塔氏亦曾參加會談，當時政府方面，曾尤諾付給相當於美金一千六百萬元之救濟，其中一部份爲物質，一部份爲現款。此事尙未完成解決，聯總駐華辦事處長艾格頓將軍正在竭力斡旋，塔氏希望於今後數日內圓滿協議，以利工作之進行。</p>
<p>仍係治標性質</p>
<p>塔氏謂全部工程中，在中共控制區內者的三百英哩，在河南省府轄境內者的三四十哩，全部工程所需費用，約在美金一千五百萬元至一千八百萬元之間。工程完竣後，中國錄年可增產麥七百五十萬祖，米一千三百八十萬担。塔氏謂限於中國目前之經濟能力，現在之工程，仍係標性質，若欲根本解決黃災，，必需有專家若干人，實地詳細研究多年，妥定計劃，需集鉅款，然後始能成功。據塔氏估計，此舉至少需時十年，需款美金數億云。</p>
<h3>共區救濟難民　商談未獲成議</h3>
<p>董必武談來滬任務</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕中共代表董必武昨吿記者稱：此來專爲接洽黃河復堤時中共區內二十五萬難民之救濟問題。昨日曾與聯總艾格頓將軍及行總霍寳樹署長晤面，未獲成議，日內或將在南京續談。今夏周恩來來滬時，曾與蔣廷　·薛篤弼及聯總駐華辦事處是時之代理處長賴氏等商談，當即談妥撥款一百五十億元，其中一部份爲物資，本定八，九，十，三個月中，每月付四十億元，十一月付三十億元，但至今分文米付，而霍署長又稱對此毫無所知，並建議在京再談。董氏稱：中共所需之救濟物資爲衣着·醫藥·及農具，耕牛亦感缺乏。並謂，中共區內尙有險工二百處，未經履　。</p>
<h3>李迪俊返吧城</h3>
<p>談荷印華僑迫切問題</p>
<p>〔中央社巴達維亞六日專電〕李迪俊專使在荷蘭控制區內，經十四日之視察後，宣稱：爪哇　僑，當前最近迫切問題，（一）匯款回國問題，（二）雙重國籍問題，（三）常地幣制之混亂，（四）進出口之統制，使華僑商人損失奇重。李氏復謂：該地關於印尼問題之空氣，廻異於巴達維亞方面，且對印尼共和國之存在，爲當地所歟認之事實。</p>

<p>甲，速辦土地金融，並積極應用合作社，舉辦大量低利農貸，以救農村倉庫制度，應從速建立並訂定合作組織，與中國農民銀行聯繋辦法，以健全農村經濟基礎，農民銀行應貫澈其專業銀行之特殊使命，配合農林部確立復興農村，扶植農產品產銷之具體計劃，按照需要運川，資金不應受任何限制。</p>
<p>乙，各銀行應速辦大量低利工貸，並准予機器及房地產作押，不可僅限以原料成品之半價爲借款之唯一抵押品，其條件不宜太苛，其手續應力求簡化。</p>
<p>丙，中央銀行務期眞能做到銀行之銀行，勿做普通銀行之業務，對於生產運銷，正當放款之重貼現轉抵押應放手做去，勿僅在商業觀點上推行其業務。</p>
<p>丁，四聯總處之組織在戰時或有其需要，惟因其借款手續之繁細時效之不重視，工商界深感痛苦，迄今舉國皆視爲復興建設途中之重大障礙，應即及時撤銷，使各銀行保特其獨立性能，完成其專業化，分類負責扶助工商發展生產與貿易　戊，在觀念上切勿誤會，生產資金之貸放，而確能用之於增加生產者，亦爲通貨之膨脹，實則善用資金，增加生產，反有收縮通貨平衡物價之實效，此爲產業金融之基本觀念，應請注意者也。</p>
<p>已，應規定銀行之存息與欠息，不得相差懸殊，使存息與欠息相接近，藉以收納社會之游資，入於正當用途，並由中央銀行，運用重貼現率逐步壓抵利息，消滅黑市以减輕產銷成本，平抑物價。</p>
<p>三，關於貿易外匯者</p>
<p>甲，根據保護工業方針，政府應從速採用，保護關稅政策，其應保護之工業，應增加進口物品之關稅率藉資調節。　乙，凡政府需要之農產物資，以及與易貨償債有關之晨產物資，應由政府依產製成本，酌加利潤收購之，以維生產，雖稍貼補亦宜爲之。</p>
<p>丙，目前國內遝輸梗阻，運費奇昻，往往增加成本，刺激物價以致不克外銷競存，應分類减免運費，國營交通機關，允應以發展貿易爲目的，不宜專從利潤着眼，又關於運輸方面，東北各省市應從速恢復海運，臺灣與華南華北應儘量增加船隻，內地河道及公路交通，應儘量疏浚修復，以求貨暢其流，溝通省際貿易，藉以平衡各地物價，促進國內特產之外運，爭取國際市塲。</p>
<p>丁，南洋市塲昔爲日貨之尾閭，其所需棉織絲織等物品，吾國正應乘此千載一時之良機，應從速獎勵輸出，確保南洋市塲，凡融通資金减息貼補等獎助辦法，應按切實需要，儘量採用。</p>
<p>戊，於發展對外貿易之調査指導，及管理機關，如以前之工商訪問局，國際貿易局，及抗戰時組織之貿易委員會，當採其所長，補其所短，重行恢復以輔導商人發展貿易。</p>
<p>己，僑胞在海外慘淡經營，以前因內患積弱保護不力，今吾國已成爲列强之一，當不容華僑居地再有侮辱傷害等事發生，又華僑終年辛勞，所得匯款回國，此爲吾國國際收支上極大之收穫，應儘量與以便利，勿使蒙受損失，應請令飭辦理僑匯機關，隨時注意改善。</p>
<p>庚，政府應協助民間，向國外購置新機器，以增加工業沒備，並採辦國內不克供應之工業原料，凡此種種所需外匯，政府應儘量供給其時限與手續，並應按切實需要，充分予以便利，又友邦出讓之剩餘物資，應公開平價交由商民銷售，其有合於工業需要者，更應優先由本業工廠配購，以資鼓勵。</p>
<p>四，關於捐稅及其他者</p>
<p>甲，目前稅捐繁重，影響工業生產，應請政府酌量减免貨物稅，應即停止舉辦營業印花等稅，稅率過重，應請酌减，直接稅應簡化稽征以避免苛擾中飽，其他各地非法攤派徵借，均應嚴格禁止。</p>
<p>乙，目前各地均感動力不足，影響生產，政府應統籌全局，從速向國外輸入發電機，並切實獎勵民營。</p>
<p>以上建議，擬請政府一一採納實施，並希政府即舉行全國經濟會議，由政府主管院部，邀集專家學者，與本會代表共同參加，俾促成戰後新經濟政策之實施，以完成經濟建設，安定人民生計。是否可行，尙請公決。</p>

<h3>怎樣抑平高利貨？</h3>
<p>關於高利貸的取締，朝野上下同有此呼聲。其見諸事實，或形諸筆墨者，的有下列數端：</p>
<p>（一）依照銀行存放款管理條例，山各地銀錢業擬定最高限度，報由當地中央銀行核定施行。</p>
<p>（二）於上項核定利率外，不得巧立名目，斜外浮收。</p>
<p>（三）取締地下錢莊，並禁止一般商號兼營存放款業務。</p>
<p>（四）由中央銀行運用金融力量，對市塲利率，逐漸予以平抑</p>
<p>（五）由國家行局酌放低利貸款，並承做重貼現及轉抵押等業務。</p>
<p>以上（一）（二）（三）諸項，是消極的手段；（四）（五）兩項，是積極的手段。照這樣標本兼施，在當局不能算不努力。然而實際的效力如何呢？通常的貸放利率，依舊在一角五分左右，超過二角的，也時有所聞。被高利貸逼倒的，近來固已層見疊出，而一般工商業的利潤，被高利貸剝削一空的，更是此比皆是。可知以上各項辦法，不是陽奉陰違，推行不力，便是舍本逐末，無濟於事。</p>
<p>事實狠明顯的，各種生產貸款，現已決定暫時停做，而抽緊銀根和緊縮通貨的方針，現仍一貫地堅持着，加上每月鉅額的稅收，和大量物資及敵僞產業的標賣，都使市塲上流通的籌碼有減無增，滬源地回籠去。那麼，上面兩項積極的措置，縱非徒托空言，但其效力豈不是完全被抵消了嗎？</p>
<p>人人知道，利息和物價一般，其或高或低，完全受供求律的支配。在努力抽緊銀根的時候，同時想要求利率的抑平，本是一件極其徵妙的事。何况銀根儘管抽緊，物價依舊在高漲，　市府所公佈的生活費指數來看，便是一個鐵證。物價旣高，所需要的媒介品——通貨，自然也要加多了。目前却是通貨緊縮，而物價加高，其他各種開支如捐稅，工資，電費，運費，乃至郵電費等項，幾乎一切一切，亦無一不在增加。在這種矛盾和複雜的狀態下，高利貸又如何會抑平得下？</p>
<p>所以當局如果眞要抑平高利貸，我們認爲：除掉認眞推行上面的五項辦法以外，同時還得實施下列各點：</p>
<p>（一）切實抑平物價，尤其必須節省政軍各機關的種種開支，從根本上减少籌碼的需要量。——因爲目前最大的消費者還是政府。</p>
<p>（二）暫時把商業行莊存在中央銀行的存款準備金，全部或部分的予以發還，藉以增加各行莊可以周轉的頭寸。</p>
<p>（三）無論中央銀行或其他國家行局的貸放額及放款手續，應儘量放寬，只要工商業者融通便利，市面上的高利貸不抑自平</p>
<p>以上都是應急的必要手段；而最緊要的，也是最根本的辦法，仍在於用全力穩定幣値，提高一般民衆對於法幣的信仰，使他們樂於「儲蓄」，直接增加存款，間接便是增加籌碼。而且對於幣値的信仰旣高，則投機和囤積之風自殺，物價也將平落，市塲可期平定。這種議論，似乎過於平凡；但須知高利貸的抑平，本是一件極其平凡的事，只能從平凡中想法，才可奏效，才無流弊。</p>
<h3>日本新憲法的批判</h3>
<p>日本憲法草案經過議會三個多月的討論，終於在本月三日由日皇裕仁頒佈，而將於六個月後施行了。戰敗後的日本人民，無異於沉淪在黑暗之中，使最倔强的日本人，也不得不感到前途的悲觀；但至今日，僅歷一年有餘，就有一部新憲法的頒佈，不久就可以走上和平民主的大道，在日本人民看來，不僅對於祖國的前途，覺得大可有爲，而且從此他們的自信，也可以因此完全恢復了。所以日人非常得意地自詡這一部新憲法是「世界上最高水準之憲法寶典。」盟軍最高統帥麥克阿瑟元帥也宣稱：『日本新憲法爲趨向世界和平。親善。與正常狀態的一大進一步。』此在歐洲其他國家，對於日本新憲法的觀感，也莫不認爲日本新憲法的頒佈，足以象徵日本已有開始步入正軌之希望。</p>
<p>回想起去年日本屈膝投降之後，盟國迭次宣佈管制日本的目的，乃在使日本政治民主化，也成爲國際上愛好和平的國家之一，不復侵略他國，威脅世界的和平與安全；麥帥本此方針，按步就班，向着盟國所揭　的目標邁進，不論是武裝的解除，防務的撤銷，軍火工業的停閉，重工業的改組以及人民的再敎育，以澈底消滅日本人民的侵略思想，均有相當的成就，這次新憲法的頒佈，對於日本政治的民主化，又是一大進步，固然誰也不否認的；但硏究這部新憲法的內容，頗多獨創一格的地方。全文共計一百零三條，但歸納起來，終不外乎下列幾項特點：（一）保持日皇，作爲國家統一之象徵；（二）議會仍採取兩院制；（三）實行普遍選舉，婦女亦有選舉權；（四）宣佈人民權利義務及其基本民主自由；（五）聲明不以戰爭爲推行國策的工具。以此與「帝國憲法」相比較，不論從那一角度去觀察均已獲有長足的進步，實爲日本劃時代的一部民主憲法。但是我們看來，日本新憲法的頒佈與施行，並不値得過份重視，而且我們對於今後的日本政治，還須　取相當的保留態度。</p>
<p>第一，在日本新憲法的序文中聲明：「日本人民希望永久和平，對於維繫人類關係之高尙意識，亦有充分之百信；吾人已決心將吾人之安全及生存，寄托在正義及全世界愛好和平的人民之善良信念上。吾人欲在國際社會中，恢復固有之光榮地位，並專心致力於維持和平及廢止專制政體的工作；並承認所有人民均有生活於和平之中的權利，有免除恐怖及匱乏之自由。」同時其第二章又規定放棄戰爭及重整軍備的辦法，聲明日本渴望基於正義與秩序之國際和平，而反對以戰爭爲推行國策的工具。這些條款，雖然充滿了和平民主的氣息，而且獨創一格，足爲日後其他各國起草新憲法，開一先列；但是這部新憲法是不是日本人民的眞意？是不是僞裝的和平？是不是爲裝的民主？徒托空言是不足爲信的；還要看今後日本的實際情形而定呢？日本必須向民主革新的大道努力猛晋，始能完成憲法中所規定的各項原則。今日世界各國，不特希望日本的舊瓶上換貼新的商標；而且還希望日本內在的政治機構能有澈底的更張。</p>
<p>第二，一部優良的憲法，必須適合其國情，翻閱各國的政治制度，都是幾百年來自然演進的結果，各有特色，也各有缺點，並無絕對的優劣，但以甲國的憲法行於乙國，即因不適合乙國的國情，而不能施行。我們把日本新憲法的內容和日本人民的實際生活相比較，不啻南轅北轍，因此我們對於這一部訴憲法的將來，實在不敢抱過大的奢望。英國約克郡郵報評論日本新憲法，　謂「在東京頒佈之新憲法，非日本憲法，而爲美國憲法」。這種評語，雖不免言之過激；但也有相當的道理，值得　帥本人暨美國當局深思的。</p>
<p>第三，日本新憲法雖然充滿了美麗的理想，究其目的僅在使他人相信日本已是一個和平民主的國家而已；但是在實際上，日本的潛勢力，依然保留；日本自投降迄今，僅僅一年有餘，而日本在無聲無息中日夜猛晋，即將恢復舊觀，不僅其製造品將泛濫於世界市塲，而且其在國際上也將恢復其固有的地位了。但是日本的復興與再起，不祇使中國深感不安而且遠東和平也要受其威脅了。所以我們對於日本的潛勢力，在和平民主的烟幕下，蠢蠢欲動，並企圖東山再起，是不容我們忽視的而應該特別提高警覺；隨時加以防範。</p>

<h3>來函照登</h3>
<p>逕啓者：頃閱貴報本月三日刋載「無錫訊」一則，報導第十七軍官總隊學員與無錫路警發生衝突一節，內容與事實完全不合，特將此次事件經過情形，詳述如下：緣十一月一日，有第十七總隊第六大隊第四十二中隊學員羅彪（原駐石塘灣）來總隊部辦理退役手續，待返隊時，行經車站，見一路警責打一年老鄉間婦人，並任意辱駡。學員羅彪，覩此深爲不平，向前加以惋言勸解，不料該路警蠻橫無理，反唇相議，遂致發生口角，時　集月台之路　甚多，聞聲蜂踴而前，不問情由，將學員羅彪圍攻痛毆，並押入無錫警務隊拘禁，時少數在站學員，聞訊前來援助，赤手空拳，意在救出被禁同學，不料該段路警官兵，憑藉武器，如臨大敵，鳴槍不已，時陶總隊長適在無錫城防指揮部開會，聞訊趕來阻止，以免肇禍。而該段路警，仍不收拾武器、對陶總隊長勸解，不予理睬，經先行命令各學員離站，並將受傷學員送普仁醫院醫治，由陳副司令會同雙方解決，此事已吿一段落。詎料翌日有少數學員携帶眷屬，來錫購物，甫下車站，該處路　，又發生誤會，即舉槍射擊，本總隊一學員受傷倒地，一時站台秩序大亂，後仍經陶總隊長馳至，始吿平息，聽候解決。陶總隊長特於連日分赴各大隊剴切訓誡各學員，均遵令在隊，未嘗有越紀行動。詎昨日海上少數報紙，竟刋載與事實完全相反之新聞，該稿顯與事實不符。查軍官總隊各軍官，均係服膺國家建國整軍之計劃，遵命編餘，本應由國家早爲妥善安置，而勝利以還，政局未定，內亂不已，致軍人復員計劃，未能如期完成。多數軍人在收訓之下，久者已近一年，生活困難，精神苦悶，然多數均能安分守己，縱有一二人行動稍涉乖異，要亦人情之所難免。軍人一向待遇微薄，與民衆相處，不免有借住房屋傢具之煩，及無票乘坐三四等火車情事，致遭社會卑視，對軍人痛苦，允漠不關心，而常以閱讀「軍人搗亂」新聞爲快事，實可遺憾！軍人抗戰八載，流血流汙，勝利後，驟被編餘，不蒙社會同情，反遭人民咒詛，其處境與心情，吾等各級官長，吿諭訓勉，旣竭心力，甚願我新聞界予以同情與指導也（中訓團十七軍官總隊學員代表第二大隊隊長張芳誠謹啓）</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山六日廣播：根據今日上午九時（上海時間下午八時）不完全之統計，在衆議院行將選出之四百卅五名議員中，民主黨員已獲選者有一百六十九名，共和黨員已獲選者有二百零九名。在競選中佔有優勢者，民主黨員有二十名，共和黨員有卅五名。（在衆議院巾佔有多數，需二百十八席。）在參議院行將選出之卅六名參議員中，（參議員總數爲九十六名）民主黨員已獲選者十名，留任者卅二名，共四十二名；共和黨員已獲選者廿一名，留任者廿八名，總數四十九名。在行將選出之卅四位州長巾，民主黨員獲選者十名，共和黨員獲選者二十名。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山六日廣播：共和黨在參議院中獲四十九席後，已能控制參議院，尙有五席猶未決定。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山六日廣播：杜魯門總統已完全見棄於其故鄕米蘇里州，同時該州現有共和黨參議員二人將爲副總統之候選人，實開美國南北戰爭以後之先例。當此惡消息傳播之際，杜氏方乘夜車自獨立城返回華盛頓。不僅杜氏自己之地位爲共和黨所奪，即其一手提拔之候選人阿克司德爾，亦爲共和黨李夫斯所擊敗。</p>
<h3>紐約州長競選　杜威果獲勝利</h3>
<p>〔路透社紐約六日電〕共和黨以「美國人民顯然已經够受的了」之口號，在衆院選舉中已佔得極明顯之優勢。共和黨在參院選舉中，亦自稱業已獲得足資壓倒民主黨之多數席。最後結果雖尙未完成統計，然共和黨之絕對優勢至今晨似已毫無問題。收穫最驚人者爲紐約州長杜威之被重選爲州長，其所獲票數多於對方的五十萬票，堪稱空前記錄。一九四八年總統選舉中，杜威之成爲共和黨候選人似已可操穩券。渠於得勝後表示：「美國人民已表示所願者非爲企圖成爲人民主人之政府，而爲替人民服務之政府，在此次選舉中，人民係在兩個性質不同，主義不同之政府中選擇上個。」紐約州參議員選舉出冷門，民主黨候選人第一任聯總署長李曼竟敗於無籍籍名之伊夫斯。素稱民主黨勢力範圍之南部諸州亦由共和黨佔上風。共和黨總統候選人競爭中號稱杜威勁敵之勃里克，亦在俄亥俄州獲得記錄票數，而當選爲參議員。杜威之又一同黨勁敵華倫，亦毫無困難被重選爲加里福尼亞州長。</p>
<h3>此後國會面目</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓六日電〕下慚國會殆必爲共和黨左右，所將遭遇之最大問題，厥爲戰時對經濟之控制，及寬弛勞資　擦之立法建議。共和黨領袖早已料及此次選舉，可恢復十五年前聲勞，奪回兩院之控制權，故已預定在明年一月三日第八十屆國會開幕前，連續會議，以便確定政策。然因民主黨人現仍穩坐白宮，故共和黨必須勸動杜魯門總統接受該　程序，或設法獲取足數贊成票，通過法案，廢止總統之否　權。此舉殊非輕易，必須獲得兩院三分之二贊成票。各議　必須決定下列各項問題：（一）徵兵延長期定於明年三月十五日屆滿，與此問題有密切關係者，厥爲政府堅主實施永久强迫訓練計劃，此點必將引起熱烈辯論。（二）陸海軍合併乃另一間題，政府對此，必將遭受海軍之尖銳反對。（三）加緊進行造屋程序，乃又一大困難點，尤以退伍軍人之住屋爲然。（四）减低戰時高稅率。（五）裁减政府經費及平衡預算，此點共和黨將獲民主黨之援助。衆議員馬丁諒將出任衆院議長。因共和黨在國會佔優勝，杜魯門總統或將再度提出大部份繼承羅斯福遺志之程序，主張設一永久內公正職業委員會，廢除在聯邦選舉中以人頭稅爲投票必要條件，興建聖勞侖斯海道及擴大社會安全法。</p>
<p>蘇聯紅星報　評美國選舉</p>
<p>〔聯合社莫斯科五日電〕紅星報今日評論美國選舉，謂美國民主共和兩黨今日已無多大分別，此可於該國對蘇聯採取之强硬政策見之。民主共和兩黨似在不息鬥爭，惟其眞正作用，無非欲阻止第三黨之形成。美國右派集團之得勢，具有一種危險結果，即如史達林總理謂，與邱吉爾爲伍者將在美國外交政策上勢力日甚。此輩主戰之危險份子，將强使羅斯福政策束之高閣，　代以范登堡之原子外交政策。所幸莫洛托夫日昨在聯合國大會之演說，已使美國前進份子獲得極大之鼓勵。全世界和平之友，切望所有前進份子能團結一致，繼續推行羅斯福之和平政策云。</p>
<h3>投票空前踴躍</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓五日電〕美國今日選舉，各地皆天氣晴明，人民投票踴躍，足以打破記錄。投票宵在東部開始，次爲中西部，再次爲西部。</p>
<p>〔中央社紐約五日專電〕今日美國四十八州中之四十七州州長，及國會議員選舉，前往投票之選民數在三千五百萬至四千萬人之譜。此次今國選舉。將　選第八十屆國會之衆議員四百三十二人，參議員卅五人，州長卅三人。惟緬因州爲例外，已於九月間選出參議員一人，衆議員三人，及該州州長，全美各地將有上載八百五十四名各大黨候選人名單，民主黨顯將敗於共和黨，因據中立政治分析家分析，共和黨將佔優勢，控制衆院，即在參院中，與民主黨十七席之差數或亦可打破，取得接近之席數。共和黨果獲勝，將對杜魯門在第八十屆國會最後一年巾及一九四八年總統選舉有重大影響。民主黨對聯邦行政之控制雖尙未結束，然此將結束該黨十六年之控制國會，並將便共和黨有效割斷民主黨之內政政策雖民主黨之外交政策各方表現其爲兩然者或尙可苟延一時，因美國係世界政治之領導者。是項發展雖係內政，但對全球亦當引起反應。總之共和黨之勝利將使美國政治上行政與立法分立，此種分立將使國際局勢危急之際，應付困難，面於內政緊張需要立法行動時，亦將感覺困難。今日選舉結果，亦可大部決定杜魯門在二年後總統選舉之成敗機會，對共和黨於一九四八年總統提名，尤其紐約州長社威之政治前途，更有影響。</p>
<h3>各國輿論反響</h3>
<p>〔聯合社舊金山五日電〕全世界對美國本屆選舉，出以如此巨大注意，實爲罕見。英國報紙對美國政治的三權分立，成以複雜的說法加以討論，語氣之間，充滿此種制度已不入時之批評。蘇聯某記者認爲民主黨與共和黨間之分歧處並不顯著，美國之外交政策等於專對蘇聯採取堅決態度。德國報紙預料：不論選舉結果如何，美國的孤立主義已吿壽終正寢。蘇聯則以美國此項對蘇堅決的外交政策滋長爲慮。英國之關切，則因其依賴對外貿易而尖銳化。日益社會主義化的英關，正出其極有組織的力量以重獲此種貿易。法國某報綜合外國方面意見如下：「得勝之一黨，當有最佳機會選擇其黨人，爲美國日後選舉的新總統。一九四八年的白宮主人，其才幹實爲美國運所繫，即謂全世界命運所擊，亦不過甚。」</p>
<h3>外長會議續開　聆取義南陳訴　南國代表準備提新方案　特港問題美蘇爭執甚烈</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社紐約六日電〕四國外長本日將舉行極重要之會議，聽取南斯拉夫代表陳述對義和的之意見。南國代表對於解決義南糾紛，將提出完全之新草案。政界觀察家相信英美法倘以爲南國之提議値得考慮，則蘇聯外長或將力促加以接受，果爾則蘇聯對英美間之主要摩擦，或可消滅。</p>
<p>〔聯合社紐約五日電〕蘇聯外長莫洛托夫今日顯然決定背城借一，使紛爭之特里埃斯特港歸入東歐集團。四國外長今日在紐約第二次會議，討論五國和的，仍以特港問題最感棘手。</p>
<p>〔聯合社紐約五日電〕美國務卿貝爾納斯今日在外長會議中堅持，南斯拉夫如不簽字於義大利和的，即不能享受該的各項權利，英國附議，法國反對。蘇聯外長莫洛托夫指責貝氏無異向外長會議提出哀的美敦書，貝氏則加以否認，雙方爭執不決，乃決定暫義討論。</p>
<h3>美對裁軍建議　草修正案</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社成功湖五日電〕關於各國普遍裁軍一事，頃據消息靈通人士談稱，美政府高級官員及政治家，刻正依照美代表團長奧斯汀最近所發表之聲明，而硏究一項計劃，準備提交聯大會政治委會，及安理會討論。　蘇外長莫洛托夫日前曾向聯大會正式提　，主張各國普遍裁軍，美國目下所擬提出之計劃，將以修正案之方式提出，即主張以監察制度補充蘇聯建議之不足。該項計劃，實爲調和美蘇兩國之計劃，得以趨於一致之第一步驟。</p>

<h3>荷蘭致牒四強政府　要求調整荷德疆界　獲礦產開採權補償經濟損失</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫救五日電〕荷蘭政府今夜照會英美蘇法四國政府，要求修改荷德疆界，並由德國賠償經濟上之損失。照會內指出荷政府準備限制其土地要求至僅作若干疆界上之調整，而擬以經濟損失賠償爲主要要求。荷政府之要求如下：（一）萊茵河左岸德國之若干礦產，以開採權讓與荷蘭，爲期四十至五十年。荷政府對於此項讓與權之取得，甚爲重視，蓋煤斤之需要可賴以平衡，工業計劃之實行亦可得更廣之輔助。（二）德國鐵路公路水道之運輸費，以及港口倉庫收費應予以管制，以防與荷蘭港口作不公允之競爭。（三）禁止德國開鑿新運河，以改變萊茵河現有之水道。（四）荷政府認爲德國貨幣政策，應以不損其重大利益爲原則。照會繼謂，荷政府在原則上反對併吞他人土地而擴張本國地域，然以荷德原有疆界，在過去已屢决造成困難，故被迫而要求作若干疆界上之調整。荷政府於此曾就下列諸點予以考慮：（一）縮短疆界綫，（二）改善當地交通，（三）局部改善運河及水道，疆界調整後結果之一，即爲可使荷德疆界綫長度自八二五公里减爲三四〇公里，德國因此讓與荷蘭之土地，當不逾一七五〇方公里，其中德籍居民的十一萬九千人，除著名納粹外，荷政府當允許於一九四〇年一月中日以前即居該處之居民織續居留該地</p>
<h3>對德問題倘陷僵局　四巨頭會議　有召集可能</h3>

<h3>聯合國會址　設舊金山或紐約</h3>

<p>〔法國新聞社成功湖六日電〕聯大會綜合委會本日開會，通過美國提案，以舊金山或紐約作爲聯合國永久會址，但此項決定並非最後性質，因大會尙未加以討論，任何代表有權提出修正案。綜合委會昨日開會時，白俄羅斯代表提出修正案，主張聯合國機構移設歐洲，當被以七票對二票否決，另三票棄權。大會主席史巴克即席宣稱，將聯合國會址移往另一國，將成爲政治上之重大錯誤。</p>
<h3>南非要求合併西南非　印代表堅決反對　應由聯管理俾早日完成獨立</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社成功湖五日電〕聯大會託管委會今晚開會，討論南非聯邦要求合併西南非一項問題，席間印度代表辛格爵士發表演說，反對南非之要求。略謂，南非此舉違反聯合國原則，且爲倒退行動。各委治地在完全自主以前之過渡時期內，應由聯合國機構加以管理。託管理事會必須迅即成立，以促使被託管地早日獨立。以言英國爲其委治地坦于尼格加所擬定之託管協定，係片面行動，該處印僑有三萬人之多，英國事先竟未與印度磋商，殊無理由可言。託管協定必須規定期限，以前各委治國家在處理其委治地內居民之政治敎育問題時，行動每多遲緩，各委洽地之非洲土人在政治上及社會上，均不能與歐洲僑民處於平等，非洲土人之政治權利，極屬有限，凡此均應改善。法國及荷蘭兩國代表繼之發表演說，以決心恪遵聯合國憲章原則爲言。</p>

<h3>色情歌舞片已成過去　好萊塢轉變作風　加插方言對白未受歡迎　小型影片料將深入農村</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕愛好電影藝術的人們，大概不會忽略最近米髙梅公司遠車代理人羅氏所露佈的該公司兩種新的製片計劃：一是在原來的影片上加插用上映地語言叙述的音帶，另一則是攝製十六糎的小型膠片。</p>
<p>不久以前在大華上映的「泰山到紐約」即爲前一種計劃的試驗，讀者當還記得戲院方面在廣告中曾以國語對白作爲號召，但結果觀眾大爲失望，因事實上並非全部以國語發音代替，而僅係用第三者之口吻，將一部份對白之內容以國語述出而已，因此未能與銀幕上角色之嘴部動作配合，情形竟類似從前的無聲電影，觀眾對此並不表示歡迎。經過此次嘗試以後，米髙梅在滬當局已將失敗情形報告美國總公司，認爲此種設施不適宜於上海，因上海觀眾大都具有相當英文程度，且文藝片之精粹全在於對白，若改用國語簡述，則必有失去原意而感索然無味。惟聞總公司方面，對此尙在考慮中，因彼等認爲此種改革足以吸引不懂英文之觀眾，而爲推廣銷路之途徑。</p>
<p>另一種十六糎小型影片計劃，則目的在發展小城市或鄉村之市塲，因此種小型片携帶極爲方便，放映塲亦不必十分講究。據聞華南方面若干小城市中，已有人與米髙梅當局簽訂合約，預料不久將來英國電影必將深入農村。</p>
<p>又據影業界人士稱：好萊塢製片作風，自戰事結束後，已在轉變中。　在戰爭期內，由於軍中娛樂需要，及人員物資比較缺乏，粗製濫造之色情歌舞片及刺激胡鬧片大量問世。現則已逐漸注重於文藝片之攝製，並改取重質不重量之方針，如最近在本市上映之「卡薩勃倫加」，「養太尋主」及「聖瑪利亞之鐘」等，均爲一九四五年出品。至於積存於本市之戰爭期內攝製之舊片，經一年餘之放映，已逐漸出清。同時美政府對於電影出口亦有限額，故此後運華之影片大部將爲新片，明年起在本市放映之電影當可煥然一新。</p>
<h3>空頭支票騙貨　贓物追獲　案犯在逃</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕王廣琴在五福弄四十二號同成行內開設恒通申莊。一日午後三時三十分許，有南市大東門外吳家弄四十七號大新碱廠主人曹新賢，向其購買美國碱粉六百袋，每袋計二萬六千五百元，合共一千五百九十萬元。當時　來新永安街十四號大陸運輸公司卡車四輛先後至北蘇州路中國實業銀行堆棧提貨車去。其時曹新賢因無現款，僅付王十六鋪外灘十號怡生申莊十一月四日期支票二紙，計九百萬元及一百四十五萬元。又國華銀行十一月三日協泰簽具之支票一紙，票面五百四十五萬元。詎到期該項支票均遭退票。經王遍尋曹新賢無着，始悟係蓄意詐騙，乃報老閘警分局。經刑事股飭股員馮秀山，幹警劉宗桐，宋家寶等根據大陸運輸公司綫索，查出曹騙貨後，係運往洋行街八十一號信餘棧。乃按址抄獲用久泰和戶名堆存之碱粉三百包，及大新戶名堆存之四十一包。又在黃埭街五號寶來棧搜獲泰記戶名二百四十六包。尙缺十三包，尙在偵查中。該曹新賢則尙未拘獲。</p>
<h3>市參議會　衛生法規兩委會　昨分別舉行會議</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕市參議會衛生委員會昨日下午七時舉行小組會議，到參議員十人，由范守淵任主席，衛生局局長張維列席。會議決定主要議案有二：（一）關於運柩一項，按照衛生局限期運出辦法通過。（二）議決請衛生局積極辦理垃圾車，以改善本市清潔衛生。</p>
<p>法規委員會，昨日下午三時舉行第三次會議，討論提案數項：（一）關於准市府函送於新訂修正房屋租賃管理規則內，予以增補例外部份，請審議通過一案，經議決：房屋租賃委員會業經市參議會第一次大會決議撤銷在案，法規委員會毋庸置議，請秘書處轉知市府限令該會即日撤銷。（二）准社會局函送上海市社會局整理圖書小說辦法草案，請修正通過案，決議請周濂澤及朱扶九二參議員審查後，交第四次會議決定。（三）關於市民林慶公呈請轉呈中央修正「僞職人員候選及任用限制辦法「丁」項一案」予以保留。通過（四）上海勞資爭議暫行處理標準。（五）上海市改善中區交通實施辦法。修正通過（六）准市參議會公用委員會移送公用局管理私有路燈規則草案請複審案，及（七）准市參議會工務委員會移送上海市工務局修正上海市工務局臨時棚戶建築暫行辦法草案請複審案。</p>
<h3>李景璐昨來滬視察　指示航業運輸問題　票價調整嚴禁黑市</h3>
<p>交通部航政司司長李景璐，昨來滬視察航政，關於調整航綫，促進航業建設，組織濟運處，接管行總水運大隊等問題，曾向航業界各領袖有所指示。關於調整各航綫客票價目情形，據其談稱：各航綫原訂客票價目實屬過低，自本年三月一日以來，至今已八個月，未曾調整，而物價指數猛漲不已，航行成本，確已較三月間增髙數倍，例如燃料管理委員會配售之煤炭，每噸價格原爲二萬四千元，現已漲至十萬元至十二萬元，柴油每噸價格由三萬四千元漲至十六萬八千元，其餘五金物料，船員薪工，碼頭費，旅客膳食等無不漲髙三倍至十倍不等。交通部前據輪船業公會呈請調整票價，迭經慎重考慮，對於航運成本及旅客負担，統籌兼顧，始決定北洋綫照原價加兩倍，滬揚等短綫增加一倍，其餘各航綫俟詳細調查後再行核議。本月份起各公用事業均因成本關係，提髙價目，我國載客之定期班輪較少，過去因票價過低，航商多不願購置客船，以免賠累，對於水上交通之維持與發展，自有妨碍。政府爲謀定期班輪之增進起見，乃核准票價合理之調整。惟出售黑市票無論出於黃牛黨之所爲，或航商之主動，皆所嚴禁，一經發現，自當依法嚴辦。</p>
<p>招商運價　携京核奪</p>
<p>李景璐氏，昨又出席招商局理事會會議，局方特擬具北洋綫客貨票運價之調整標準，及民營航輪要求漲價之經過情形，書就詳細報告，而陳李司長帶呈交部核奪。李氏已於昨晚夜車返京，航輪之票價問題短期內當可解決。</p>
<p>滬通各輪　並未抬價</p>
<p>日昨報載滬通綫私抬貨運價目消息，本市輪船業公會秘書長李雲良向記者鄭重表示，完全不確。據稱：現在由上海至南通貨物運價，每噸衹有一萬二千二百元，乃本年三月一日所核定之價目，尙不及黃浦江駁運過江之駁費，實屬極度低廉，九個月來毫未增加，但堆裝工力等費，則已漲髙多倍，概由輪船公司支給，而航行成本尤激增不已，行駛該航綫各輸船公司，勉力支撐，煞費苦心，絕無私抬運價情事。</p>
<h3>付車資奉送耳光　拔手槍行人遭殃</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨晚十一時半，廣東路正豐街口中央旅社門首，有四五人分乘三輪車到來，因車費爭執發生口角，當經該旅社司　出爲調解，始告無事。嗣隨行又一同伴雇坐人力車前來，亦因車資糾紛，復起齟齬，該坐車者除將人力車夫披摑一下外，並由腰部拔出手槍開放一響，人力車夫幸免於難，不料流彈適中行人顧仲祺之後背，貫穿前胸，應聲倒地，肇禍後，其同伴數人，分作鳥獸散。兇手經附近街警拘入老閘分局偵訊，據供名周福雲，廿九歲，河南人，係稅警糾察隊隊員，該隊隊長徐亞鵬，甫於二日前闢室于中央旅社三二五號房間，同伴四五人係到旅社接洽要公，此次肇禍實係手槍走火云云。傷者後送仁濟醫院療治，聞性命堪慮。</p>

<h3>節約運動委會　推行節約用電　願大家早睡早起　吳市長建議七點</h3>

<p>（一）凡燃點時間較長之處提倡改用日光燈，（日光燈開關過頻，極易損壞，故以使用時間較長之處爲宜）（二）凡無點燈需要時，提倡及早熄滅或减少燈數。（三）提倡早起早睡，以節用電。（四）組織視察隊對於公共塲所工廠及商店，分別予以指示與勸吿。（五）减少門燈，增設路燈。繼吳市長又作更具體之建戲稱：節的用電，最重要之時間，每日下午五時至九時，其切實有效之改善辦法，積極方面有三：（一）改裝日光燈，各大商店尤當實行（二）減少燈光支數，以一百支光改爲七十五支光，四十支光改爲二十五支光爲標準。（三）减少燈泡數量，以十去三，三去一爲標準。消極方面有四：（一）由本會函商會轉飭各商店實行節的用電，違者將各商號名稱公佈於報端。（二）由本會函各機關總務處，及人事處負責施行節的用電，違者將各機關名稱公佈報端。（三）由本會函各區公所請命各保甲曉諭各戶。（四）由本會函請靑年團組織節的用電勸吿隊，自本月十一日起分赴各商店，各住區勸吿節約，到會各委員，一致贊成，至六時始散。</p>
<h3>電力專家意見　僅限住戶點燈　無補增加生產　本市電荒時間實際在白書　根本問題還是在機器不夠</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕關於限制用電，上海電力公司將於本月內發出第一批通知書，包括各用戶中同時裝置電熱與電燈火表，及商業用電。關於普通家用電燈用戶，限制額將暫緩通知。本市電荒之主因係機器問題，而每日電荒最嚴重時間爲上午，的缺一萬七千瓩，下午的缺一萬瓩。晚間電力並不鬧恐慌。故本市電力專家認爲：以限制住戶電燈用量，以增加工業生產，與本市置際情形不符。因白畫無人使用電燈，而夜晚電力並不缺乏。本市每日電力消耗最高之時間爲下午六時至七時，故電力公司甚盼公衆於該時間內節省電力。</p>

<p>侯家談工程設施　浦江上建大橋　設計迄未完成</p>
<p>亟盼聯總接濟更多材料　五億美元貸款原則談妥</p>
<p>記者昨訪晤行政院工程計劃團侯團長家源，叩詢聯總運華交通材料，五億美元貸款，以及建築浦江大橋等各項問題。據稱：聯經爲協助中國交通專業之發達曾先後運來火車機頭三十二只，枕木四十餘萬根，及其他零星之材料多種，唯國內鐵路交通百孔千瘡，所需器材特殷，亟盼聯總方面能更積極大量接濟。我國湘，桂，黔，贛等省雖亦均有枕木出產，預計明年一年產量，能達百餘萬根之多，然終不能應付全國鐵路之需要。關於美貸五億元事，據侯氏表示，在原則上中美雙方業已談妥，一俟國內政局安定，即可成爲事實。工程計劃團爲供給參放資料，特分區派員視察，調査全國各地之交通事業，刻已調査完竣，並將此項調査之詳情，趕印報吿書，及一應表册，陳交政府作爲貸款之參考。今後該團之工作計劃，仍以調査設計工程與推動實施爲目標，務祈全國之鐵路，公路，交通工程，均能依照旣定計劃，逐步完成。關於建築浦江大橋，工程計劃團，已將原則決定，即於浦江上游建活動橋樑，浦江下游即本市商業區，建地下隊道，工程之沒計及經費之預算，由中國橋樑公司負責，一俟設計完成，經費核准，即可動工，唯其完工時期，預計在二年至三年後。</p>

<h3>市場賈氣頗盛　金價又漲六萬</h3>
<p>烚赤繼續趨昂，客銷紛紜，市氣殊堅，晨盛開二四〇萬有售，開後初時在二四〇萬光景，屢有起仆，十時後央行以二四〇萬二五之價，配給一二〇條，此後買氣又盛，單帮客紛紛携金而走，實銷仍殷，買戶陸續活動，供源雖有，並不暢達，近午盤漲到二四三萬五，午刻在二四三萬左右盤旋，午後人心更俏，臆測復濃，隔日交易步漲至二四六萬，結果較前收再漲六萬五，飾金掛高至念六萬，紋銀平而銀元微回，暗拆息價在一角半左右。　外幣平穩，純受金市激勵，美鈔暗市的四一〇〇元至四一五〇元，較前收稍昂，港票受金市之刺激而稍堅，然因電滙仍鬆，漲而不力，結果回升十元，港滙去路無，八六五元成交較股，印滙一〇四五元至一〇五五元，英滙一四〇〇〇元左右，美滙掛牌未更，對做仍未開展。</p>
<h3>統債慘跌</h3>

<h3>紗布續漲　廿支漲三四萬　布價高一二千</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日紗市續見挺秀，各路客帮雖有添辦，然數量均屬零星，粤帮對重磅仍有納胃，加以坯布織廠，亦在抵補北銷空額，故人心愈堅特雙馬一度重見二百廿五萬之高價，獨有天津營口之天夫女牌，因根子奇緊，其勢尤銳，收市時雖略回低，然脚地甚堅，結果廿支又升三四萬，細紗去化仍未見暢，布市客銷亦稍動下午市價高升一二千元，本街櫃銷漸活動，惟紡建開出之貨，未見好轉，大都僅平賣而已，現貨略高，龍頭細布做八萬元，藍鷄做七萬七千元。</p>

<h3>華股補空雖多　市況並無起色</h3>
<p>華股昨以證交當局對遞延交割，不克定期開拍，須待部令決定，買方不無失望，惟空方不斷補進，雖跌而多盤，晨開各股已露疲態，開後即這多方了結而趨低，伹多盤旋，低後尙有補空，形勢不定，賣買雙方進出零散，缺乏特變，十一時後迄十一時半，低後漸漸回升，一六六號九七號一九八號均有補空，一度盤漲到晨開價之上，伹屬　花一現，不到五分鐘，斬售復起，在零星之供給聚合下，十一時三刻後，復見低價結束，較前收計熱股永紗美亞信和景福新光勤興各跌少許至半成不等，冷股大通火柴永公羅安五和景綸內衣平穩，華　微升，餘均微挫，午後形勢呆滯，交易微細，僅華　五和略有升降，餘者不脫盤局，結果較前收熱股永紗美　景福信和新光勤與各跌百分之二至平成不等，冷股則公司麗安平平，火柴升半成，華豐內衣景綸微升，五和跌一成，餘者微挫，總成交額計爲一一七五萬股，塲外各股平和少變。</p>
<p>外股依然初穩　疲，新買絕迹，除怡啤尙形平定外，餘者均感軟弱，結果較前收計怡啤平平，怡紗美聯業廣微降，會德豐紙業航業鋼業各跌半成光景。</p>
<h3>粳秈平疲　生油漲跌無常</h3>

<p>據悉：南運棉紗之分配額，工廠將以其紗錠數及生產量爲標準商號方面，如欲申請出口，須先獲得工廠之准賣憑證，方可向紡管會申請南運。至南運布疋，一月將分四次審核。南運布疋之分配額，工廠將以其生產量爲標準。商號則以過去運銷華南各口岸之範圍爲標準云。</p>
<h3>燃管會供給有限　煙煤市又起風波　存底越少申請者越多　公會將擬定具體辦法</h3>
<p>烟煤各貨目上月廿六日後，因燃管會調整煤價，通知煤商業聯營處暫停配售，同業謠傳紛紜，幸經公會方面努力奔走，業於本月一日照常配售，唯限額每月僅二萬噸，市塲風浪暫吿平靜，同業申購極爲踴躍，至本月四日止，聯營處已配出一萬一千噸，公會方面爲維持同業下半月實銷，及避免操縱起見，責令聯營處於本日起，暫停配售，俟公會擬定具體辦法後，再行配售，現聯營業之存煤僅燃管會本月允配之餘數九千噸，及上月有額六千噸，兩共一萬五千噸，是以同業人心更爲忐忑，並有一部份同業對用戶已預先出售之貨，無法向聯營處抵補，逐向黑市搜購，是以烟煤黑市價格猛升，每噸較聯營處配價高一萬元至四萬元不等，尤以烟煤屑最俏俐。</p>
<h3>皮毛出口困難尚多　北地交通未復新貨未到　美銷權操外人條件不利</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕頃據本市皮毛輸出業中人談；該業前參加出口貨　覽會時，所陳列各項皮毛樣品，曾引起瑞士　事勞君之興趣。當會向該業接洽，由該業採集各項精美皮毛產品，派員運瑞舉行展　會。該業以本市月前皮毛存貨，適在靑黃不接之秋。新貨不到，而存貨將馨。各種貴重皮貨，允多來自華北．又以困於交通，一時無法採辦，故如欲將皮毛各貨搜羅俱備，派員運瑞展覽，勢不可能。現決就近在江浙區搜購鵝鴨毛及羊皮等，寄瑞舉行小展。至該業最近皮毛之外銷，以紐的爲主，惟情形不佳，貿易大部操諸猶籍商人手中。國人雖欲直接對外交易，惟條件殊爲不利。例如須多付一筆營業稅，貨物稅雖稱可免征，惟仍須先付後扣·此外如利息費用，國外僅常年六分，我國即以中央銀行之低利，仍須月息五分。在此四面楚歌聲中，實無法與外籍輸出商，爭一日之短長云·</p>
<h3>優待同行　央行減低匯率</h3>
<p>據悉：中央銀行，爲便利商業銀行，特按該行規定匯率，予以七折優待，此項辦法，　於該行此次行務會議所決定，現已照辦。</p>

<h3>市場不景氣　讹言比較多</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕近日外界盛傳本市若干素負聲譽，資力雄厚之公司，商號，均有週轉不靈之說，市塲上資爲談助，茲據記者分訪各該有關公司商號，證實在目前銀根抽緊之下，流動資金偶感枯竭，事屬有之，惟未臻嚴重階段。日來外間以訛傳訛均屬過甚其辭，各家平日往來賬目中，不乏向其他商號或親友移借情事，風聲所播，或提前索還，或逕行提存，事態遂見緊張，現開各該公司商號，多已備足現款，聽候提領。人心亦漸安定矣。</p>
<h3>木材到貨多</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕週來木材接　進口，爲數甚鉅，長大之松木，　滯於白渡橋蘇州河口，如許之木材，一時恐不易他運。昨日招商局林森輸自福州來滬，亦裝來木板二千三百噸·</p>
<p>出口方面，紗布略有北運，昨其美輪駛津，裝去棉布五百件，棉紗一百八十五件，糖一千六百八十餘包，茶業七百餘相，鐵皮三百件。培德輪昨日開往汕頭，有大量豆餅五萬二千五百九十餘塊運去，又有芝蔴四百五十包·</p>
<h3>棉花收數不旺　原因在運輸困難</h3>
<p>國產棉花，收購已將竣事，據紡建公司收到各地報吿稱：西安，沙市，漢口，南通，天津等各收花處，現已彙　　，總數不過十萬担，其餘尙有小部份，朱接到報吿，預計數量，亦屬有限，蓋國營民營各紗廠，本年收花地點，均集中於交通便利處，對運輸困難地方，均裏足不前，故收汎之劣，爲歷年所未見，而明年度之紗廠原料，仰給於外棉數量，將較往年爲多。</p>

<h3>化學肥料缺乏　台灣糖產大受影響</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據悉：台灣糖業公司刻正而臨肥料之缺乏間題。緣台省農民，在日人五十年之統治下，殆已用慣化學肥料，如氮，磷酸，硫酸錏等。然該項肥料，悉爲戰時之必需品。故戰後各國均感缺貨，我國亦不能例外。該項肥料，目前在世界上，並無公開市塲。而十九均集中同盟國　食管制會統籌分配，由聯總發配各國。然聯總分配該項肥料，原則上以種植糧食爲主。食糖一項，竟以列入奢侈品，而不能分得杯羹。惟台省之　糖事業，在全國之經濟事業上，及該省之經濟復興上，有密切之關係。果台糖因故不能種　，則台民至少有百分之五十五，須宣吿破產。徒使在經濟上予全國有莫大貢獻之台省，變而爲全國經濟之負担。又通常合省植蔗時期，爲每年之十，十一，十二，及一月。如該一時期不及下種，則所有中國糖業三年五年之復員計劃，均將全盤宣吿流產。現聞合台公司　　。比而處於苦悶境况中，方擬積極打破難關云</p>

<h3>中美商約　從擬議到簽訂</h3>
<p>— 四日南京訊　本報記者漢德玠</p>
<p>受孕</p>
<p>醞釀了許久許久的中美商約，終於在十一月四日下午四時整簽字了·這是個骨格大，斤兩重的嬰兒，被孕育了三年零十個月，才呱呱　地，無怪乎它的降生是可怕的難產，記者羣好像催生婆，愈催愈念，終於今天爲它接了生，可眞也是不容易。</p>
<p>中美商約的最初提起，是在民國三十二年一月十一日中美新約第七條裏，那一條裏規定，中美雙方同意，在兩國共同努力爭取勝利的正義戰爭結束後六個月內，即開始進行談判，要把過去所有的，零零碎碎規定在陳舊的約條（多半是不平等條約）裏的，或是在事實已經存在的，雙方的商務關係，僑務關係，經濟關係，航　關係，設領關係，加以整理，揀選，　除，再肯定。訂一個旣合乎現在國際　的規定，又不致使中美關係受到意外的動亂，無所不包括，無所不適合的完美商約。可是從那時一直到勝利，美國，一方專心致志於歐洲的爭取勝利，一方又要凖備亞洲的積極行動，中國，一方準備反攻，一方又忙着應付敵人最後的張狂。無論見誰，在戰爭正　張的時期，總不會忘記戰爭，而記起勝利以後的事。於是這一條規定就被人淡淡的遺忘了許久，這一顆已種下的種子，乾瘍瘍的躺了兩年多。</p>
<p>賦形</p>
<p>去年春天勝利快來了，盟國已開始準備應付勝利後的局面，已開始計　確立和平的基石，聯合國大會於四月廿五日在舊金山開幕了。想着復興與　　的人們記起了就要該作的事，關於簽訂中美商的這一工作，在華盛頓有了初步的接能。我國的商的權威主幹（彼時經駐美大使館商務參贊），經濟學者係恭度（資委會經硏所長）和駐美助理商務參事劉大中等三位，代表政府和美國國務院方面曾數度交換意見。過了夏天秋天，歐洲和亞洲的勝利先後得了，伹美國和她的盟國間的經濟關係也更爲密切了。中美的邦交一向是最友好的，經濟合作，工商互助，是維持美國繁榮與促進中國建設必由的道路。伹爲了獲得一切進行正常的保證，一個準據一個法規是必需的；中美商的開始了具體化的階段·華盛頓提出了她所希望的的稿，由主幹等帶到了重慶，外交部條約司忙了起來。在二月初他們　集了政府各關係部門的意見，衡量我國戰後的局勢，參考了專家學者的意見，提出了一個對案。正式談判開始了，我方參加的代表是主幹（返國後已就任了最高經委曾副秘書長），外交部條約司長王化成，顧問兼美洲司長程希孟，美方代表是參事施麥斯（現已調任駐津總領事）白德華和國務院特派來華的顧問，美國杜克大學的國際法敎授，威而蓀博士。（他二月初來，就原則方面有所決定後，三月裏就回國去了）</p>
<p>這約稿和對案正如一株幼小植物的兩片子葉，一苗幼芽擷取這兩片子業裏的義料，慢慢長大，成形。</p>
<p>發育</p>
<p>從去年二月開始，這苗幼芽，一點點抽，一點點長，雙方一條條談判，把談得的結果草訂成條文的技術工作，是美洲司帮辦陳世材，和條約司帮辦于能模，專員王之　，陶樾等數位，他們和代表們同樣的辛苦，耐心，謹愼，一字一句的把相同的意見推敲着寫下來，譯出來。這幼芽一天天發育長大，中美商的一句句商定。但這時國內正是政治空氣正濃的時節，政協，整軍，二中全會，參政會，一個接着一個；，記者羣全沒注意到中美商的已在發育階段。是四月初本報第一個登出了重慶專電，「中美商的正進行談判中」，大家算知道了這回事；四月下句各報又刋載了香港路透電，「中美商的正進行談判中」誰也不曉得這兩倏電是不是一條化身而來，可是這事是確定了，雖然因爲各有關方面嚴守秘密，始終難得到更多的消息。</p>
<p>我外長王世杰簽署中美商約情形。　（俞培靑攝）</p>
<p>簽署中美商約之美大使司徒。（俞培靑攝）</p>
<p>簽訂中美商約代表爲本報記者所作之簽名式　（記者漢德玠寄）</p>
<p>成長</p>
<p>從重慶到南京，談判一直繼續着。困難不斷發生，也不斷解決。美國要求的是更多的工商業經營的自由，與國內經濟穩定國民利益的確保。中國要求的是利川外資來帮助民族工業的發展，與海外僑民居住生活的安全。這雙方的要朮，如果得到合理的配合是決不會發生爭利奪權的矛盾的，但是由於過去缺乏合理的配合，以及不平等條約與歧視法律的殘餘效果作祟，事實不乏矛盾，彼此考慮却極度審愼。在中國方面，這是不平等條約取消後第一個商約，建國在開始，她必得儘量取得外援，所以條約要細密，尤其要安全。在美國方面這是戰後的一件大事，一九二九年敎訓不遠，她必得合理的取得東方的市塲與中國的合作，所以條約也要細密，要安全，爲了這，有許多問題耽誤了不少時間，尤其是移民，工商業經營，開一礦權的保留，沿海貿易之界說等等都經過相當時間的切磋，而有如今條文所規定的相關的結果，中美商的的談判過程中，曾開過近四十次的會議，它是如此慢慢成長的。</p>
<p>檢騐</p>
<p>胎兒在母體成長，檢騐是應有的程序，檢騐之後才可以診斷，它是否正常，出生時是否順利。中美商約在它成長階段中也時常經過檢騐。在磋商時，每遇車要的決定關頭，美方會打電報去問華盛頓；我方也更鄭重其事。國民參政會行政院全派人參與過諮詢。立法院的吳經能委員（現任駐敎廷公使）也經常與外交部聯絡。十月中草稿初定後，更曾經國防最高委員會審議過。這種周愼的檢騐工作，保證着中美商的將會順利的經由雙國批准。在這一段期間是記者　最緊張的時候，盼望着快生早生，佇立在產室外等候，遇機會還想從門縫裏偸看一眼，偸聽兩聲。十月下旬，外交部條約司忙得不可開交，李幹也幾乎天天跑外交部。正式的本開始了工楷抄寫，細心打字，一遍，兩遍，一直校對了十幾遍。情報司回答的詢問時說「快了！」「快了！」</p>
<p>降生</p>
<p>這肥碩的嬰兒終於降生了；全權代表派出了，日期地點也都定了，巾美商約出世了。</p>
<p>十一月四日下午，在行政院三樓會議室裏正式舉行簽字典禮，室內佈置大半如常，莊嚴簡單，左端牆上是國黨旗與國父遺做，對面是蔣主席着戎裝禮服的合像，兩側排兩列座椅，一律罩着潔白的布套，正中横擺一張長案和五座錦墊高背椅，長案上舖着嶄新的小格白檯布，左端一套翠玉西式文具，右端一套全部巾式文具。條約正副一共四木，中國保存的一份正副兩木一式深紅皮面，燙印着靑天自”徽，封里是素綾。美國保存的一份正副兩木，一式深藍皮面，燙金的框邊，燙金的鷹徽，封裏素綾也燙着金邊。每本都是中英文同救，中國保存的就中文在　，　　　保存的就英文在前。每本卷末都　着兩條紅白藍三色的絲綵　，　四位簽約代表的火漆印實　固着。它們的决序和簽字的决序一樣採執有者居先原　排列下來。長案前是五　水銀燈，雖則它已是背門向實·</p>

<h3>豫省參會　一幕民主劇　舌劍出了鞘　又放進了鞘裏</h3>
<p>— 十月廿八日開封航訊　本報記者王瘦梅</p>
<p>豫省參議會昨天（二十八日）演了一幕有驚無傷的舌戰。記者簡直不敢回想，想起來到現在還有一點胆顫心驚，眞的，你想，當那些怒髮冲冠的戰士們在慷慨激昻舌來唇往各不相　的當兒，萬一有一個缺德者，從窗外擲進一塊磚頭，那還不馬上墨盒與茶碗齊飛嗎？如果那樣，秩序大亂，誰敢說空中的武器有眼睛不會落到記者的頭上？但是，感謝上帝，幸而沒有遇到這樣不幸的事情，因此我覺得雖然受了一次虛驚，也眞開了開眼界。</p>
<h3>三十餘位參議員　緊急臨時動議</h3>
<p>事前有些敏感的人們，都預料到昨天上午的大會一定要有一塲激戰，所以記者席上老早就擠滿了人。但是大會開始好久，並沒有動靜，秘書處及駐會委員工作報吿後，都平靜無事，劉議長於是就宣佈討論提案，正在這時，參議員席中就有人站起來了，他緊張的高呌道：「主席，四十七號，四十七號，本席有緊急臨時動議！」全塲都有點震動，大家都把眼光注射到發言人身上，那是于參議員起先，他持着嚴肅的態度，用着沉重有力的步子，拿着他的「緊急臨時動議」走到主席口前，把那「緊急臨時動議」交給了韓秘書長，韓又轉遞給劉議長，修養功夫已到爐火純靑程度的劉議長，看了看，把那「緊急臨時動議」疊起來，放下了，說時退，那時快，馬上就有人高呼：「請主席宣讀緊急動議內容！」於是劉議長就把那緊急臨時動議交給韓秘書長宣讀了，那動議大意是說省府劉主席忠貞爲國，功在地方，抗戰期間，艱苦支持，光復後慘淡經營，此次出席本大會，因受重大指責，率全體委員電請辭職，同人等均表惋惜，應以大會名義電請中央挽留。署名於這緊急動議後面的，有王普慶等三十餘人。韓秘書長宣讀剛剛完畢，應聲而起的是六十號劉參議員基炎，他以嚴正的態度，發表了他鄭重的意見，他說：「劉主席此次因受王參議員友梅的批評和指責，率全體省委辭職，本人比任何人都惋惜，我與劉主席爲三十年老友，私交最篤，挽留劉主席，本席不願後人，但劉主席此决因受本大會指責批評而辭職，本大會實不能失去人民代表立塲，出而挽留，所以我提議用私人名義去挽留，我不贊成以大會名義去挽留！」劉參議員還沒有說完，又有人喊：「主席，一百號。」那是坐在最後一排的一位，三十來歲，綠色制服，操豫北口音，按坐决表着，知道是楊參議員虞夫。他說；「前天開幕典禮，劉主席因王參議員友梅代表致答詞，而認大會對其不諒解，實在王參議員的意見，實不能代表我們全體，而且在本大會開幕典禮中，劉主席係以來賓身份，參致答詞中所稱：「把銀行送交中央，劉主席和孟廳長有交換條件，說什麼一個局長，如何如何，試問王參議員友梅有沒有根據，有證據不拿出來，就是懦弱，沒有證據說空話，要負責任的。王參議員友梅獨斷專行，目無一切，此次所提兵役一案，在事前未徵求我同意，竟而盜用我的名字，如此武斷包辦，還成話麽？」他悻悻的坐下了，手還拿着禮帽在桌上拍了幾下，全塲一部分人還拍了拍手。王參議員友梅，又站起來辯了幾句，他說：「請求减少兵額，爲河南目前刻不容緩的事，亦爲本會急需付諸討論的大問題，以時間倉促，不及送個個人簽名，所以才如此辦，而且你平常常對我囑託如遇有於民衆福利有重大關係的案子時，我願意跟着「和稀泥」，這一次請减兵額，我不知道你不同意，所以替你簽了名。」這時萬頭攢動，想發表意見的太多了，這裏也喊主席，那裏也喊主席，口頭戰爭進入了最激烈的階段，秩序混亂，不能形容。郭參議員海長堅決反對以大會名義挽留劉主席，趙參議員培五也大聲疾呼的說：「用個人名義挽留劉主席，本人先簽名，如果以大會名義挽留劉主席本席堅決反對！」尙少衡參議員發言稱：……以大會名義挽劉主席，我們參議員論如何不能作，自古有諫諍忠臣，本會代表民衆，向政府指責批評，正是忠於民衆、忠於政府，劉主席如爲忠言逆耳，即全體辭職，我們參議會如果出面挽留，那就是承認自己不忠實！」王參議員式渠加致賀，本大會代表只應代表同人　蘇賓致謝，殊不應在隆重典禮中，予來賓以責難，因此，我們完全贊成以大會名義挽留劉主席，王參議員友梅的致答詞，只能算是他個人的意見，我們決不同意。」</p>
<h3>議場風雲緊急　口頭戰進入激烈階段</h3>
<p>劍拔弩張，戰雲密佈了，王參議員友梅不慌不忙的站起來，他先喊了一聲：「主席，我有幾句答辯！」然後他轉了轉身，把面孔斜對左後方。「參議會開幕典禮中須向省府主席致恭維詞，在法令上，我沒有看到有明文規定，我也沒有看到法令上規定不准參議員代表在致答詞中指責批評省主席，我只知道參議員在議會中有自由發　權，如果大家認爲我的話不應該說，或者不能代表大家，我說的話我自然負責，可是你也有發　權，你當時爲什麼不提出反對呢？「另一個人又站起來了，那是六十一號王參議員普慶，他是絕對贊成挽留劉主席的，他講話的神氣，可稱謂「氣壯山河」口如　河般他還沒講完，五十五號劉煥東連喊了幾聲「主席」，於是他五官並用，先把桌子槌擊了幾下，然後聲色俱厲的講起來了，他說：」劉主席辭職，大會挽留不挽留，是其次的問題，不過我覺得，劉主席受命於危難之間，中原事變時，本省各界人士都越秦嶺，逃到西安，人家坐鎭內鄕桑坪，指揮抗戰，誓與河南共存亡，艱苦支持殘局，直至敵寇屈膝，這種精神，誰能比上？所以我說，沒有劉氏兄弟，就沒有河南。光復後，人家收拾河南殘破局面，備極動勞，現在還這樣責難人家，試問還有良心沒有？况且王參議員友梅在，王參議員普慶等好幾個人，異口同聲，抨擊反對以大會名義挽留劉主席者，雙方勢均力敵，旗鼓相當，你攻我擊，各不相讓，全塲空氣之緊張，已到了萬分緊急的時候了。我揑一把汗，但我仍以最大的決心，準備看到底，因爲我覺得像這樣的民主劇是不容易看到的！</p>

<h3>君子愛人以德　宏亮的聲音壓倒議眾</h3>
<p>六十號劉參議員基炎在人聲鼎沸中，終以宏亮的聲音壓倒了衆議，他說：「如果用個人名義挽留劉主席，我情願向劉主席叩頭作揖，但以這樣爭吵之後，再以大會名義去挽留劉主席，對劉主席面子上也不光榮，君子愛人以德，我決不願因愛護他，而更使他不光榮，同時我覺得殊有失大會尊嚴我們不要忘記本身立塲！」也有一大部分人鼓攀。二號呂參議員蘊　，道時亦應聲而起，他的特論是這樣的：「挽留劉主席，可以說是均有同感的，不過可吾用大會名義挽留，或者用個人名義挽留，這個問題擬請於散會後，由每一行政區推一代表和議長詳細硏究。」渴望和平的第三者，有人附和了，好多人提議散會，但主戰份子仍喋喋不休，堅欲以力取勝。　主席台上年高德劭雍容坐鎭的劉議長，這時從容不迫的站起來了，他心平氣和的把雙方的爭持和第三方面的意見作了一個綜合的結論。他說：「關於這個問題，本席有所證明，挽留劉主席，是大家共同的意見，實際上挽留的事情，我們昨天已輕以另一種方式開始作了，如果再用犬會名義去挽留劉主席，有人顧慮到大會尊嚴問題，也實在有考慮的必要，究竟用何種方式，我們可以採用剛才一位參議員的提案，散會後推代表切實硏究，現在開始討論提案。」他一說完，馬上就念起提案，好多人雖然還在磨拳擦掌，但也只有暫時把刀放了鞘衷。雖然在討論兵役案子的時候，也幾乎又鬧了起來，然而畢竟因爲時候太久了，人困馬乏，終於沒得鬧起來。</p>
<p>一塲激烈的爭辯戰，總算叨天之幸，有驚無一傷，不然的話，我想這幕民主劇，必定要被收進將來「河南民主政治演義」裏去。</p>
<h3>梁垜一暼</h3>
<p>— 十月廿五日梁垜訊　本報記者凌松籌</p>
<p>時間是廿三日下午。</p>
<p>地點在安豐八十三師前進指揮所裏。</p>
<p>前綫劉光宇團長，就是防守泰典的那位。下了脚踏車，走到李師長面前說：</p>
<p>『張家舍對岸發現敵人三四百人，向王家新園附近移動，有渡河偸襲的企圖。現在我們準備迎頭予以打擊，請師長的示。』　師長說；</p>
<p>「打什麽！他敢嗎？他過河，正好幹他一下。」</p>
<p>考慮了一番，師長隨即吩咐：</p>
<p>「砲兵陣地向顧家灶方面移動，準備射擊。在王家新園對岸的兩河交又點，工兵營應加强工事，準備造橋。在曹家舍附近的重砲也開始準備。步兵俟今晚情報如何，聽令行動。」布署完畢，師長用指頭在地圖上劃了一個箭頭。說：</p>
<p>「在這兒作戰，和安豐富安一樣，非側面行動不可，正面總歸是不行！」</p>
<p>記者身歷其境，曉得梁垜的命運，已經決定，明日可見分曉。　機槍聲和砲聲，攪了一夜。</p>
<p>廿四日晨，果如預料，記者聽到了國軍收復梁垜的捷報。隨即趕到前綫，師長早就到了那兒，記者劈頭就向師長問：</p>
<p>「梁垜收復了嗎？」</p>
<p>「今天早晨五點鐘。」師長很與奪地回答我。幷指着地圖上的三里庵說：「先頭部隊已越過此地了！」　過了一會兒，他又從口袋巾掏出一張預定行動計劃。在圖上，記者圻到，有個箭頭指着梁垜，尾巴上寫着：「十月二十日—廿五日」。師長很詼諧地說：</p>
<p>「事實總不會超出我的預定計劃之外。哈哈！這是我的法寳，法寶！」　十二時，副官處派員到梁垜設營。記者隨行，到這收復剛有七小時的地方去看看。</p>
<p>安豐與梁垜，相隔只有七華里路。車行十分鐘即達。</p>
<p>滿街都是國旗。但全是舊的。有些人家用一張紅紙糊在一根蘆葦上，掛在門口也算是懸旗歡迎。標語觸目皆是，紅紅綠綠，使一座死鎭，陡添了不少生氣。　居民對於國軍，情緒非常熱烈。大家異口同聲稱國軍是「菩薩」。對於借物件，協助工作均能努力以赴。　共軍由梁垜撤退在四時左右；五時，國軍就進駐該鎭。在國軍前進槍聲大作之時，居民以爲戰局緊張，紛紛渡過鎭東的一條河，向鄕間躱避。槍砲彈從頭上飛過，全都嚇得魂不附體。直等到黎明，才曉得望眼欲穿的國軍已經到達。有一位居民指着一件濕衣服對記者說：</p>
<p>「早曉得你們「菩薩」要來，我們還躱什麼呢？你看，沒有被子彈打死，倒險些兒被水淹死！」</p>
<p>法幣在道裏很少。有些鉅額的法幣，他們還沒後有看見過。記者親聽見一位主婦對他的丈夫說“</p>
<p>「你看到吧？五塊十塊的鈔票和從前的一樣啦」！有一位還從身邊拿出疊得整整齊齊的一把十元五元法幣給記者看；我想，這總該是抗戰八年前的古董了！</p>
<p>商店的門半開半掩。記者要向茶食店中買點雲片糕都沒有。晚間買了些白菜下麵吃還是請房主人費事辦來的。物價尙未步入常軌，大槪普通的東西跟着米價走，而米價又以安豐一帶爲準則，現在米價大槪三萬六千元一石，好的。</p>
<p>共軍撤退之前夜，在梁垜散了不少的宣傳品。已經快要瓦解的蘇北共軍，至此刻尙不改其揑造事實的老毛病，反足以表現出他們聲嘶力竭的一付可憐相！</p>
<p>居民對於國軍，一方面敬如「菩薩」；一方面又畏懼得像一個可憐的小孩子遇到嚴肅的父親一樣，以前的事，什麽都不敢說，記者找了一張十元「抗幣」，費了千言量語，才得到手；想再找第二張時，他們無論如何不答應了。</p>
<p>梁垜的男人比女人少，靑年人尤其更少。大槪總已經逃出去過流亡生活了，一條大街上，只見軍隊不見老百姓，這種現象倒是挺特殊的！小孩子很多，也最活潑。記者曾問一個女孩子會不會「秧歌舞」？他的母親搶着回答：「我們不懂」·但是等一會兒，記者拿口琴吹了二句「5656i6i5i65323……。」時，門外的兒童，都哼起來了。我心裏暗暗好笑。　　廿五日淸早，李師長也來了，記者隨同到砲兵陣地視察，攝了一些照片。在陣地上，記者從特種剪形望遠鏡中，已經很淸晣地看到東台城郊的某一座廟宇，和一座寳塔。按梁垜距東台十八華里。國軍砲兵陣地的射程已伸展到東台。師長笑着說，「人不趕到他，砲也得趕到他！」</p>
<p>哈囉！東台，總歸不出月底，咱們見面！</p>
<h3>藩陽即景</h3>
<p>— 本報東北特約記者　開榮欽　十月六日藩陽航訊</p>
<p>深秋了，瀋陽還不太冷，風也不大，天空，除了間或給灰白色的雲層遮蔽着之外，還是顯着蔚藍色的時間多，亮晶晶的太陽，經常給人們帶來溫暖。東北同胞說：往時秋天，瀋陽是天陰的日子多，不時還洒着惹人厭的微雨，今年該是例外了。</p>
<p>電是通了，可是電力還是不足，電路又常出毛病，白天沒有電，晚上也忽明忽滅：像徵着我們目前的局面。</p>
<p>在東北，目前是沒有大仗打，可是接着西　，西安等地解了圍之後，國軍將領，如孫立人，廖耀湘和龍天武等，却依然顯得那麼來去匆匆，到處探頭探　的記者先生門，也不瞎得他們什麽時候來了，又什麼時候離開了。</p>
<p>物價漲不聞便宜聖</p>
<p>半年前，甚至三個月前，從關內來的人們，不時讚美東北的物價便宜，可是，現在誰也不說了，甚至要搖頭咋舌說貴了。大米跳上七八十元一斤，高粱米也漲到二十多元，猪肉一百三四十元一斤還不易得·皮貨稍爲看得上眼的就得三四萬，甚至有六七十萬元一件的貂皮。好些人在說：要是半年前買下十件八件皮貨就可發一筆不小的横財了·顯貴們在關內聽慣了個「萬」字，到了關外用錢也不大在乎。公敎人員個個搖頭嘆氣·購黄金雖然已經成了歷史的名詞，可是單帮客却份外活躍：從吉林或長春，四平等地運百把斤大米來可賺幾千元至一萬元，從海城營口運來蘋果，螃蟹也有對倍以上的市利，誰不幹！那怕在沒篷的車廂里或有篷的車廂頂上受罪幾天，嘗嘗撤退返國的日僑甚至霉濕的倉庫里的箱包同樣的生活也是値得的！日夕在吉林埋頭寫畫的某　家也拋下畫筆到潘陽來想設法要個把車廂運載貨物了。　一比十三，在物價高漲的瀋陽，也逐漸成爲歷史上的名詞了·銀行匯款是一一，五，暗盤流通券的幣値就更低，一元才換到國幣十元甚至八元。</p>
<p>由於瀋陽的物價高，平津的貨物就適時地源源運到了：「美國打火石」，「美國紙烟」一類的、字眼，隨處碰到：賣紙烟的攤販，日有增加，他們的數目，恐怕不見得比報販少，都把裝璜美觀的美國烟齊整地擺在最顯著的地方。土產紙烟，即使是從上海運來的，也得打入冷宮了：即使個格比半年前便宜得多，光顧的人還是不多。</p>
<p>交通亂　車輛負責任</p>
<p>正在開會的市臨參會，除了給公敎人員出出氣之外，還數出瀋陽的「七亂」：其中之一是「交通亂」。市政常局是把從車站進城的大道那半概沙石路加上柏油了，公共汽車，電軍，，也出來點綴了，可是交通還是有點「亂」。軍用車輛是得負一部亂的責任的：久不久的，牠們不是把一輛馬車碰得原形消失，就是把一輛三輪扭個翻身·行車速率那麽高，有時連目不轉瞬的交通警察也來不及指揮·公共車輛，尤其電車，是太少了：站上半個鐘頭，不一定搭得到。跟着公共車輛的出現之後，三輪車和馬車空車走的多幾輛了，可是依然沒有失掉牠們的重要性。</p>
<p>春日町—當日擠得水洩不通的日本街，日僑走後，曾經一度冷落過，現在又不冷落了：代替了前此的日僑，我們的同胞在那里擺着密密的舊貨攤。毛貨，皮貨，民用，軍用，堆得高高的。價目，較幾個月前高了幾倍至十數倍。買的還是有人，人們是不會全忘多方的敎訓的。　擺脫了嘈雜的市區，坐車或步行到郊外溜溜，身心似覺愉快多多；雖然，在郊外也看到不少未成年的年靑人或老態龍鍾的老者，揹着重重的一捆捆的柴草，接二連三的，從遙遠的鄕間，蹣跚地向瀋陽進發，使深秋的原野益增其凄荒。</p>
<p>市郊外　北凌兼東陵</p>
<p>市郊的北陵和東陵，有點像南京的中山陵和明孝陵，到瀋陽的人們，總想去看看。去北陵的路較近，坐車子從市區出發，十分鐘就可到達。因爲是深秋了！人影寥寥，除了門前三數照快相的和賣菓品的之外，走進去有門堪羅雀之感。那怕門券僅二元！到碑石和祭殿去的中央大道，寬闊平坦，也還潔。大道兩旁那密密地站着的松柏，深綠而帶黑。看到了它，會敎人神往情移，也會敎人感到空虛。刻着漢滿紀念文字的碑石，又高又黑，要不是有人抹上一些白粉，訛也難得看淸半個字，誰也不知道在碑石百歩外的墻陵里長眠的是清太宗。</p>
<p>去東陵的路北陵的路更遠，從市區出發，坐吉普車至少得走三十分鐘。東陵是淸太祖陵寢所在。建築的式樣，和北陵一樣，該是北陵仿東陵建的。四週用城牆圍着，城墻外邊儘是陰森森的栢林，爬上祭殿的第三層樓，可遠眺野外風光。墳墓是　座三丈多高的小山，山頂還抹着一層洋灰，可是大半剝落了。照快相的人說！在　前，不論東陵或北陵，都不准人們進來看，只有日本人才例外。</p>
<p>在瀋陽，不是鬧着屋荒嗎？可是在近郊還處處看到空禿禿的房子。這些房子雖然破壞得僅剩下個空売或僅剩下四片牆，如果修理一番，總還有用處吧。</p>

<h3>書市歸來有感</h3>
<p>— 統先</p>
<p>我每次跑書店可說總是乘興而去，敗興而返。一言以蔽之，我們只覺得中國文化界的貧乏。關於時論的書，我們知道作者無法脫離個人的立塲，伹是我們所見到的大半是宣傳氣味太重，有的近乎謾駡，有失時論家的風度。關於科學的書籍，那眞是沙裏淘金，不容易找到幾木。即使有幾本也是過時的東西，至於說自己的發現或實騐報吿，我們還沒有看見。關於學　性的硏究著述，有創造性的鉅製可說沒有，甚至於要找一本有系統的作品都不多見。幾位學術界的先進們項多也祇是出幾本文集，把陸續寫出的許多零碎東西彙集起來出版。後起之秀有整套硏究的又還沒有產生。</p>
<p>這證明抗戰八年來學者們因爲生活的艱難，環境的不穩定，無法從事於有系統的研究。胡適之先生說北平學生的程度比戰前低落了三年，我想我們做學術研究的人們又何嘗不是退步了三年。也許還不止此。這是我們在抗戰中的精神損失。別人無法賠償我們的。這需要我們自己來彌補。學術的空氣到處都非常稀薄。我們但願研究學術的人們能够把心情安寗下來從事於著述，把已經暗淡下去的文化光輝重新照耀起來，使我們在書坊裏多看見幾本偉大的作品。</p>
<h3>「社會思想」</h3>
<p>— 雋之</p>
<p>著者：孫本文　出版：商務印書館</p>
<p>我們生活在今天，那應被「揚棄」了的迂腐的學理，却依然有人在把它發榮茁壯，沒有認識的靑年朋友，如果把這些學問接受下來，就會「中」了它的「毒」，而竟會把這前進着的時代倒拖轉去。</p>
<p>這，可以說是一個莫大的危機！</p>
<p>不錯，時代是不住地在發展着，在這發展過程中，新的思想的成長，和舊的意識的「揚棄」；是不斷地在循環着。人們總因隨着新的成長，去推動着新的發展！使世界日趨繁盛之途。而我國，却隱伏着這個危機，新的思想不能採用，舊的腐氣却在擴展，長比以往，再隔十年二十年，不知要成一個什麼中國？才有「思想」能統治一個整個的人，思想一受「毒」，所作所爲亦必然如此；所以，我們搶救這危機，也首先使人們有正確的思想，由這正確的思想，去改造一個新的前進　社會。目前中國學術界，正有着這一個偉大的使命！</p>
<p>青年的認識</p>
<p>廣大的靑年羣，由於這環境的使然，或養成一種小資產階級的惡習；除功課而外，把光陰消磨於電影，文藝小說的裏面，固然，這亦並非壞事，但你對於社會的認識却不能獲得，雖也有「鐵流」，「鋼鐵怎樣鍊成的」等革命事業的文藝著作，而如果沒有知道當時的時代背景，學術思想源流，則雖讀上述之文藝，而仍不能瞭解：這時代到底是怎麽一回事？則對「社會」依然沒右認識。</p>
<p>總上所述，我們覺得對社會有認識的必要，對思想則有推進步的必要；是則多讀一些正確學術的書籍更爲必要。據一位在大學執敎的先生統計，目前中國大學生留意於學術思想者，百中僅佔二·三，以是觀之，中國社會的落後，乃情理中事。</p>
<p>靑年朋友們！我們決不自甘落後，而現在大家也來讀一些學術的書本，認識這世界。</p>
<p>這段不得不作的贅累，到此爲止。現在我向諸位介紹一本易讀的書——「社會思想」，在這書裏面，簡潔明瞭地講了許多西洋社會思想源流與內容，自柏拉圖，亞利斯多得起以至馬克斯，孔德止；闡述了歐美思想各家思想之要點，裏面並講各家之學理的正確與錯誤之點；我們可知其大略，其結論我們不一定接受。而對各家之思想，讀後可具一影像。由這影像，再作進一步地硏究——各家個別硏究；由此而我們能得到各時代的認識，並用自己純學術客觀的觀點去研究得各家正確的認識。　在這裏，我簡單地將這書作一分析與檢討：</p>
<p>古代的遺產</p>
<p>柏拉　，我們知道他是希　的署名哲學家，（紀元前487—347），他曾經從學於蘇格拉底。他的學識是以「公道」爲主，書裏回簡　的　到了他的生平與思想。著作「共和國」可以表現他的一個理想的　社會。除柏拉　而外，亞利斯多德，斯多　與伊　鳩魯；亞氏的哲學以社會自然產生；斯氏以爲產生於「統一意識」，伊氏則以爲產生於　私　利。</p>
<p>羅馬的古代哲學則與希臘相異，因交通便利之故，國內較統一所別者，包勒比：重視因果，倡導政治循環論；西寒祿：以爲人有社會本能；孫尼加倡社會起源於人性墮落之說。至耶穌與基督宗敎式的社會思想，以上之五家，均不能適宜於今日之社會。</p>
<p>這古代過去之後，進入了中古時代，阿奎納的「神學諭」，但丁的「神曲」，均受宗敎的影饗甚深；但丁的稱揚帝國主義，歌頌空想之和平，以一人獨裁世界；其雖創和平之法，但至今尙難見之於實際。，</p>
<p>自此中古末期後，　變化到近代初期，王權廢立，各國亦向自由和平的途向走去；此時起，已一新過去之陳腐，義大利的麥基雅維立的以政治不道德爲愛國，即施行苛政以待民，這種思想是實現於打跨了的日本之類。路德的「服從論」，加爾文的「基督敎原理」，均是落後　的思想。鮑當則可與亞利斯多德媲美，學理甚相合。</p>
<p>當十五六世紀時英王專制昏庸之政治下，出現穆爾的「烏托邦」兩卷，評擊當時社會，其表現出常代社會的狀况。繼其後亦有不少「烏托邦」思想者。十七世紀時英人霍布士的「利維祖」，「自然與民族的規律」；洛克的「人類悟性論」，慮騷的「社會契的論」；三氏代表了當時代的社會思想。同時，法人孟德斯鳩的「三權鼎立說」，說明當時的要求。至一七四七年的社爾戈，會著「財富的生產與分配論」，有人說是「國當論」的前驅；在杜以前，培根，笛卡兒，蒙坦等均亦站於「進步」的途道。</p>
<p>休謨的以懷疑派稱著。法福爾泰，康道塞，均爲法國革命時期之改革家，但還他們太信任了主觀的科學的力量。同時，在德國則費希德和黑格爾的主觀觀念論，改爲客觀觀念論。亦爲當時人們所採納。</p>
<p>自然主義亞丹斯密的「國富論」，乃經濟學上的貢獻；其社會思想有「放任」政策，亦爲减少壓迫之獨創見解。亞之密友佛格遜的一社會思想亦與亞同爲自然主義者，他論人民有「向上心」，社會的進步又靠文化與心理二因素；斯時，他們這見解，已屬難　　　　　·後亞派的經濟學者尙有馬爾薩斯．馬之思想更進　　「人口　」。人口　的增减原　，置之於今日，當然已不正確</p>
<p>西門主　用科學方法硏究社會現象，或爲孔德社會學之　　；在孔德社會學創立前後，十九世紀時，社會思想表現着「一元論」的傾向；白克爾以物質環境的作用來解釋社會現象，戈太紐則與白相反，以爲　族是民族與文化盛　之主要；張伯倫則信任天賦。</p>
<p>最後二章，論到了馬克斯與孔德的社會思想：</p>
<p>關於馬克斯，是以「資本論」一書名聞天下的，該書之成就，無論贊成及反對馬氏學議者，均很稱揚；本書內、論及馬氏的時代背景，及其「唯物史觀」的重要理論略加闡述。作者指出了馬氏的各種錯誤，但有些主觀的論調，這一點需改站在客觀之立塲。</p>
<p>至於孔德，乃爲思想界中之一重要人物，其對社會學之貢獻甚巨，孔德之一切，書中所述最詳，但因詳，亦未免有「過譽」之處。我們避開這點，就可更能了解孔德。</p>
<p>以上，我略爲分述了一下本書的內容，這本書，除難免的一些小錯誤而外，大部份是値得我們採取的。</p>
<p>前面說過，贖本書較易明瞭，因材料尙豐；我們可以拿這本書來作爲研究社會思想的出發點，並不一定完全接受其結論，但可讀其闡述之簡潔。</p>
<p>靑年們！希望諸位漸漸養成正確的思想。</p>

<h3>「曠野的呼喊」</h3>
<p>— 蕭斧</p>
<p>蕭社是位心地慈祥的老婦人，心裏不存半點刻薄，嘴裏不帶半句咀咒。她閒閒　散地，絮語道她週圍的小事物，平常而親切，淡泊而自然；惟其親切而自然，也就　所用其怨憎。即或寄賦着淪亡之痛的「生死塲」，亦未嘗不如是；彷彿七八十歲老人，話當年的戰禍，引起了回憶裏的親人，和喪失了的心愛的小物件，也不免在　娑的眼角噙幾顆酸心淚,一任牠含着或是落下，—畢兌年代是久遠了，在時間的侵蝕下，已消磨了椎心的苦楚，和切齒的憎恨。肅紅作品的風格亦如此。</p>
<p>那些芥末似的小人物，微賤而不足道，爲人遺忘在人世的角落裏的，一經她逐個逐個地提起，無不勻分了她深邃寬博的同情。沒有頂天　地的角色，沒有聳人聽聞的故事；不是常兵的帮傭的，就是撑船的種地的，再不然就是些燒窰的浣衣的：這些人心眼好,日子苦，一一受着她熱情的愛　。在另一篇題做「手」的作品裏，那染切主的女兒上了學，同學們譏笑她那襲浸透了靛靑的藍手，厭惡她疏遠她；她感到人世好冰冷，大　天讓她父親肩着行李接出了學校。她躭心處，作者陪她躭心；她飲泣時，作渚陪她飲泣。作者同悄了她的遭遇，該掉轉筆來抱怨欺凌了她的人吧？沒有。愛妍惡媸本是人之常情，作者不感到她們有什麽乖常的可憎。</p>
<p>在她的筆下，找不到一個可憎的人物。即或是折磨死了童養媳的婆婆，和洛墓爲活的老鰥夫，作者無不給她們原恕，幹他們開脫，小媳婦病重的時候，她婆婆不曾想盡了方法：偏方野藥，迎神趕鬼，看香扶乩，傾家蕩產地花費了五千多吊錢，因此哭瞎了一隻眼嗎？「那家的團圓媳婦不受氣？……雖然說我打得很了一點，可是不很那能規矩出一個好人　。」那運花池畔的老頭子，兒子死了，媳婦嫁了，起初他不會用兒子的斧鋸，試着　想學做一個木匠嗎？他半夜出去盜墓的時候，不是瞞着他孫兒，一想起可能給他窺破時，他「感到很大的羞辱，立刻紅了臉」嗎？「　難」一篇裏的何南生，一面跟學生講着　土地共存亡之類的漂亮話，一面綑起了破痰盂空罐子早早地擠上火車的，算是用了最不客氣的態度了，但也只是冷冷地調侃了一下，說不上重起輕落的譴責。通篇沒個可憎的人物，蕭紅所描繪的對象是貧困與無知。她不申斥入性，而抱怨制度。</p>
<p>人物是平常的，情節是簡單的；說切實一點，大多的作品裏沒有什麼故事。蕭紅算不得小說家；她是個散文家。一個撐船的老人殷勤地招待那X路兵，及至問明那兵士正趕向他的家鄕時。央他帶個口信。（「黃河」）帮傭的婦人愛上了主人家的勤務兵，依依地送他去打仗，暗地想把工錢攢積下來安排未來的家庭。（「朦朧的期待」）鄕村的姑娘帮個疏散來的下江人洗衣，遺落了這優厚的差司後，她依舊上山去打柴。（「山下」）一個小紅鬼初决被人鬨起來演講　地說不出話來，在人羣的笑聲中着急得大哭。（「孩子的演講」）那些小人物的生活她多麼親切，他們的悲歡她多麼體貼；儘管是些無足重輕的小節目，她隨手拾起，隨手捺下，絮絮地談着，輕輕地撥着，像調弄一張幽　的琴弦，唱出沒有曲調的散漫的音節。</p>
<p>在文藝的勞　上，她現着怎樣的身分？—她熟諳民間的疾古，而不動刀圭；像一位心地仁慈而蓋忠職責的護士，蕭紅用溫暖的同情和輕柔的語調，春風似地撫慰着在地照拂之下的悲苦呻吟的靈魂。</p>
<p>「逆來順受，你說我的生命可惜，我自己却不在乎，你看着很危險，我却自以爲得意。不得意怎麼樣？人生是苦多樂少。」（「呼蘭河傳」後記）這是蕭紅的自剖。她道「逆來順受」的性格，不獨普遍地影響了—而且深刻地漫透了作者筆下的人物。</p>

<h3>詩人故事　陸放翁和唐蕙仙</h3>
<p>— 唐敬德</p>
<p>有宋一代的愛國大詩人陸放翁，（名游，字務觀，山陰人）他生平有一件最傷心不過的事，使他到八十多歲還是惦念不能忘記的，便是他的愛妻唐蕙仙，不得於其姑而被迫離開夫家，唐氏是閎的女兒，和放翁是中表姻親，平時亦能屬文，不過沒有像李清照朱淑貞那樣的精妙罷了。</p>
<p>唐氏自被其姑驅逐，放翁就暗中想法爲她在外面租了房屋，私下還是互相往還，但好景不常，有一天，偶然爲其母衝破，此後陸游即被監視，與蕙仙隔絕，不再有機會往還了，而唐氏呢，正當年青，無所依恃，不得已再適同郡宗士程，（一設適趙）那時故翁也由母親的選配，擇期而婚。</p>
<p>然事有巧遇，有一日，放翁無聊到禹迹寺鄰近的沈民園閒步，碰到了蕙仙夫婦，放翁當時未便招呼，而唐氏却告訴了宗士程，說是她的表親，士程就設了酒肴款待陸游，蕙仙也盡了地主之誼，躬自敬酒佐飲，放翁觸景生情，悲不自勝，即在園中壁間題了一首釵頭鳳，詞曰：</p>
<p>紅酥手，黃藤酒，滿園春色宮牆柳，東風惡，</p>
<p>觀情薄，一懷愁緒，幾年離索：錯錯錯！</p>
<p>春如舊，人空瘦，淚痕紅浥鮫綃透，桃花落，</p>
<p>閒池閣，山盟依舊，錦書難托：莫莫莫！</p>
<p>放翁那時祗三十一歲，他的詞意是說因蕙仙黃酒而引起舊事，提到他母親的頑固，使他小夫妻倆遽賦別離，雖然懊悔，已經晚了，唐氏見了題詞，也和他一詞，（惟此詞頗疑後人附會，）詞曰：</p>
<p>世情薄，人情惡，雨送黃昏花易落，晚風乾，</p>
<p>淚痕殘，欲箋心事，獨語斜欄：難難難！</p>
<p>人成各，今非昨，病魂長似秋千索，角聲寒，</p>
<p>夜闌珊，怕人尋問，咽淚裝歡：瞞瞞瞞！</p>
<p>後來過了三十七年，放翁已是六十八歲的老人了，一日又到沈氏園去，那園主已易了人，唐氏亦已不在人世，他又做了一首游沈園，詩云：</p>
<p>楓葉初丹檞業黃，河陽愁鬢怯新霜，（潘岳曾作河陽令，三十二歲始見二毛，二毛指白髮也。）</p>
<p>林亭感舊空回首，泉路凭誰說斷腸，</p>
<p>壤壁留題塵漠漠，斷雲幽夢事茫茫，</p>
<p>年來妄念消除盡，回向蒲　一柱香。</p>
<p>時又隔了七年。他七十五歲了，一日，重潡沈園，再賦詩二首云：</p>
<p>夢斷香消四十年，沈園老柳不飛綿，</p>
<p>此身行作稽山土，猶弔遺踪一悵然。</p>
<p>又</p>
<p>城上斜陽畫角哀，沈園無復舊池臺，</p>
<p>傷心橋下春波綠，曾是驚鴻照影來。（驚鴻—洛神賦有　若驚鴻句，此處借喻其妻唐氏也。）</p>
<p>這樣的又過了六年，他年邁了，已是八十一歲的古稀老翁，然而他還是多情，在一個歲暮的晚上，他做了一個夢，夢見沈園的一切，梅花依舊，伊人不見，那五十年前題壁的釵頭鳳詞，諒也剝落漫　了，他的詩云：</p>
<p>路紅城南已怕行，沈家國內更傷情，</p>
<p>香穿客袖梅花在，綠蘸寺橋春水生。</p>
<p>又</p>
<p>城南小陌又逢春，只見梅花不見人，</p>
<p>玉骨久沈泉下土，墨痕猶鎖壁間塵。</p>
<h3>深巷　外一章</h3>
<p>— 胡牧</p>
<p>深巷</p>
<p>那一灣深深的巷子，使人摸索不到的巷子呵……我來了。</p>
<p>雨夜，我諦聽着那一聲聲瘠瘂的銅鑼，一個算命的瞎子，帶着一個十一二歲的小姑娘，那小姑娘沒有貴人家女子那樣的白晳，柔嫩，生活的風霜使她苦够了呵……</p>
<p>這一條小巷子，前幾天，有一乘馬車的喜轎，似乎那一個寒傖的人家又要嫁女了，那一個貴族的少爺又要娶「堂客」呵……</p>
<p>雨天，我更怕走這一條巷子，因爲，這一條巷子不但黑，而且非常泥濘……我只愛深巷中那一爿茶館，每天，有多少流浪人在訴說着生活的艱辛。</p>
<p>我只愛那巷中有一個人家，他們似乎是每天在街上賣唱，一條雲板，一把胡琴，再配上那瘠瘂的喉嚨，引起那些窮人們歡喜。</p>
<p>我更愛那深巷中，一盞明亮的小燈，照着我在黑夜中跋踄的路程。</p>
<p>買水記</p>
<p>清晨，天空正飄起朶朶的朝雲的時侯，此時天空裏正要放射出萬丈金光的朝霞，買水的女子出來了，蓬鬆的頭髮，扭扭的腰肢，兩隻眼睛惺忪地，怔怔的射出疲勞的神光，這時茶房的火爐騷動了，除了火星在石灶中畢畢剝剝的跳動以外，其餘便要算買水的女子少嬌嫩的聲音了。「開水，一壼……」你聽，這聲音多優美，多雅緻，多婉轉呵！</p>
<p>而每一個買水的女子，總是穿上紅綾小衫，菓綠布或淡青色的小褲，照例是拖一雙木板鞋（有許多婦女更拖上大紅緞子的拖鞋），當她們一羣羣地去買水的時候，我知道，她們的習慣一面是免得燒火費鈔，一面將這開水拏去煮飯，這樣買水的姑娘，決不是豪商大賈，貴族之家了。相反的，他們是屬於一種貧民階級。每天，我看見她們提着茶壼向我抿着嘴兒笑，我了解她們生活的艱辛……</p>
<p>於是，在雨天的街上，我更愛在茶館里坐着，等待着她們，她們喜歡聽我講新時代中的寓言，我却需要聽見她們生活之故事……</p>
<p>作家趣事</p>
<h3>安徒生臨睡咒駡</h3>
<p>— 沈思</p>
<p>安徒生（Hans　Christian　Andersen　1805—1875）是丹麥著名的童話家，他最胆小而多疑，聽說他在每天臨睡前，必須把一本厚重的書，向床舖底下摔去，口里還唸唸有詞的說；「嗨！我還怕你嗎？你又來了呀！我老早就曉得你躱在床底下。」這麼一套，他每天都要表演的，因爲他怕有人躱在床下，好乘他睡熟後來害他</p>
<h3>讓時間來考驗信仰　—法國作家慕洛亞的和平觀—</h3>
<p>— 王銳</p>
<p>幾天以前，我跟一個年青的法國軍官閑談，當納粹德軍侵入亞爾薩斯快要進佔斯屈拉司堡的時候，他正駐在亞爾薩斯，當時情勢十分嚴重，防綫不能輕易即被突破。</p>
<p>「我當時以帶領一百個兄弟，」這個年青的隊長對我說，「但是我忽然異想天開，我覺得要保全斯屈拉司堡全靠我們這一百琴一個人，要是我們能堅守我們的扇形陣地了什麼事可保萬無一失。當然，是時情勢的演變并不完全如此……</p>
<p>「然而，後來果然不出我們所料，所有其他扇形陣地，都和我們有同樣的念頭，決定絕不屈服後退；結果陳綫竟固若金湯，德軍終未能越雷池一步。」</p>
<p>我們今日所處情勢正復相同。假如我們不願意和平的防綫輕被突破，那末我們每個人—男的或女的，少的或老的——必須作如是想：「這全靠我痛下決心，我應該盡我所能保衛和平。」</p>
<p>面對一個和平的世界，一個毀滅的世界，我們現在必須加以選擇。因爲，如果我們不能够精誠團結，那末最後我們必然被原子彈個個擊破。</p>
<p>當今情勢迫使我們考慮，什麽事全靠個人的作爲。要是人類內心不產生一種空前的革命，這種革命對放世界和平大有裨益。——那末一切教育顯將徒勞無功。我們能够而且我們必須作最大努力保衛文化。和平的基礎，這兒不是，那兒也不是，就在人類的內心。我們務必彼此堅守我們之間的這個信仰。而你們美國人的責任尤爲重大，必須對此反復思量，獲一正確允當的結論，因爲你們是當今世上最強兩個國家當中的一個。我的美國朋友們，你們應該顯示給世界上所有其他國家看，從對經濟問題的公平解決上，我們能够奠定和平的基礎，而事實尤待你們作不懈的努力。</p>
<p>譯者按：慕洛亞係當今法國名作家，二次世界大戰時不堪納粹壓迫，流亡美國，以上係慕氏最近離美還法國故鄉時，對美國記者的談話。</p>

<h3>一寸山河一寸血　85</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>因恐燈光掃來，不便俄延，稍稍打量了一下，我下了石牆，也跟踪虎弟，鑽到叢樹裏面。一放暗號，虎弟却在叢林從邊應着。這叢林全是一色的德國冬青，密密層層的栽着。費了好大的勁，才得穿了過去。一眼就看見，所有建築，都在北部，三三兩兩的散佈着，燈光不多，也不大，想是重要人物都已出發的緣故。正中一座，好像立體建築，是堡壘形式，黑沉沉的矗立在那裏，十分兇惡。這片廣場，少說也有一里地以上寬闊，全是沙泥混合舖成，地面却是黃一塊，黑一塊，好像高低不平，其實十分平整；四面都有這樣一色的冬青圈住，僅僅在極北兩端各開了一個入口。</p>
<p>這禁衛區的形式，與我們所擬的草圖，完全不同，所以這探險的工作，只好重新做起。目前第一個問題，就是要躱避巡哨。這一帶叢樹，當然是一種進行工作的掩蔽，但也只能遮蓋人類耳目，却掩不住狗的嗅覺。照表面上看，像剛才那出巡的人和狗，只有一個人和一隻狗，僅需兩顆子彈，就可了事。可是萬一子彈不能命中，　不會打着致命地方，一時警報出去，我們必致身陷絕地了。而且這地方，十分寂靜，槍聲一響，無異自己替敵人報警，豈能隨意亂來？</p>
<p>可是我仔細推算一下，剛才那個巡哨走過時節，大約七點半鐘，大概沿路走來，算他半小時，那麼他必是七點鐘從出發地點動身，半個小時走到這裏。這巡哨照普通時限來說，不是一小時一次，就是兩小時一輪。照今天這種冷靜情形看，也許三小一輪，也未可知。如今以小心謹慎爲上，只算他一小時一輪，那麼，現在至少還有四十分鐘功夫，我們很可沿着這一帶叢樹朝東再拐北，徜徉過去。</p>
<p>從前在塞子裏，我同虎弟打游擊的時候，也有幾次，同着哨探敵人的營寨，所不同一點，那時雖說二人襲入虎穴，但有後援，有恃無恐。這裏僅有我們二人，時地情形，大相懸殊，所以我命虎弟先行，我在二三丈距離從而吊着他的路綫，這樣無論前後有警，彼此都有一點援助，也可牽掣敵人。</p>
<p>順着這條叢林朝東，到了盡頭，又拐彎朝北走着。就在這樣動作之下，我們平安達到了敵人的建築區。現在的問題，就要探明這些建築，是些什麼用場，大部分人在什麼地方。測量這第一個問題，祇有拿建築形勢來猜想，第二點可以燈光多少作標準。我們所在的這一帶，是建築的左翼，一連有四座四層高的西式洋房；每座相隔二三丈距離；看樣子都是大門朝南，設計方面，壯實之中，藏着拙笨；估量下來，大概是辦事，和宿舍之類的屋子。奇怪的一點，是聽不到一些任何聲音，也沒有崗位。側邊也有近十丈寬的空場。</p>
<p>看那當中的立體建築，一望而知是主要司令部，有五層高，頂上好像是平台，有很強力的無綫電收發設備。西邊一帶，因距離太遠，我看不清楚，據虎弟說，好像是倉庫樣子，因窗戶是圓形，小而少。</p>
<p>我們觀察了一下，隨即在黑暗處，繞到那四座建築的東側。一挨到轉角處，這才隱隱聽見遙遠的北邊，有些人聲和收播的音樂；原來這四座呆笨建築的後背，還有一排一排，許多小型房屋，人聲和音樂，都從那裏傳達出來，並且燈火較多較大。不用說，大概那一帶，必是營房。所有留下未曾開拔的小隊倭軍，凖是住在那裏。</p>
<p>我們這時，很小心的沿着屋牆基，一面找掩護，一面向前襲進。到了第一座屋東北角，我們側身貼在牆角站着。</p>
<p>「小姨，」虎弟指着東邊空場的邊上說：「還是跑到那一帶叢樹邊上，順着林子，挨到後邊去好嗎？」</p>

<h3>書報攤</h3>
<p>— 少夫</p>
<p>爲整頓市容計，應辦的事實在太多了，比如交通問題，雖經當局數月來的努力，已進步不少，憑心說，還不够標準，比如各十字路口的黃色止步綫，旣未普遍，且漆好兩三個星期即褪去，而且行人車馬往往都超越了此綫。</p>
<p>現在當局又來取締中區的書報攤了，行人道的雜沓，若干書報攤的妨礙交通原是事實，但我們也應該替這班小本營生于者着想，且不說積極方面他們在推銷書刋流通文化的功績，有若干書報攤也並非一例都是妨礙交通有損市容的，因之，當局不妨指定若干地帶，容許他們繼續擺設，或是就原有情况，加以種種限制和改善。能如此，書報攤販們常無不樂從之理。</p>
<p>書報攤究與平常小販攤不同，有很多攤販們都受過中等敎育，他們逼於生計，力不能肩担提籃，無已，凑合挪借一點資本，從事此項近於寒士的買賣，其情可憫，而其行爲亦復有裨於社會，故於取締攤販禁令中、最好能稍稍考慮，可不必一視同仁也。</p>
<p>歐美通衢大道，往往亦有報攤點綴其問、可見交通與市容之舒暢壯觀、主要原因却另有所在。</p>
<p>我們絕對擁護當局對市政各方面的　劃苦心，勇赴事功，我們更願當局凡百事體能設想週到，有步驟的以求改進，俾於自然漸進中走上軌道。</p>
<p>上海陰暗面</p>
<h3>「老鬼」與「老老鬼」</h3>
<p>— 維</p>
<p>昨晚十時許，我由曹家渡乘公用角的五路公共汽車回校，大槪是因爲很晚，乘車的人很少，車廂裏一共只有五六個人，在我對面有兩個着中裝短衫的乘客相對高聲談論，因爲聲音講得很高，所以吸引了我的注意。</p>
<p>坐在右邊的一個，歪戴着呢帽，手裏夾着半截香烟，在頃訴他的得意經過——</p>
<p>「哈哈，阿×老子昨日夜裏發着一筆意外之財，哈哈，簡直是意外之財！」</p>
<p>「那能？」他的朋友覺得很有聽一聽的必要。</p>
<p>「哈哈，昨日夜裏，我在儂處吃之老酒出來，行之半路，突然鑽出兩隻小鬼（上海音讀『　巨』）向我借銅板，嘿嘿，老子也正在想明朝的米那能下鍋來！嘿，偎猜我那能樣，老子對伊講：哪兩位老鬼今朝算是碰着老老鬼</p>
<p>一就在這辰光，街角上轉過來兩位四裝朋友，老子一想，主願釆哉，於是對伊啦講：「要借銅板跟了老老鬼來！」老子等這兩位走近，給伊肩上一拍，「喂！兩位老板借點鈔票來用用。」伊啦頓之一頓，像是有點尷尬。老子也對伊啦頓頓：「漂亮點，鈔票借點子來，身上西裝，老子今朝饒了啦，勿要不識相。」兩小子總算漂亮，享不啷十幾萬隻洋全拿出來了。哈哈……老老鬼那能？」</p>
<p>接着車廂裏一陣笑聲，五六個乘客，售票員連××先生全都捧腹大笑。他那位朋友更是連連稱贊：「意外之財，意外之財！」</p>
<p>坐在車角裏的我，不但笑不出米，不禁不寒而慄了。到上海來了幾個月，差不多無一夭的報紙上沒有登載了搶案，各式各樣的搶法，各式各樣的案子，使一個來自小城市的我着實開了不少眼界；但是像昨晚這樣做了强盜而在公共汽車裏像得意傑作般的歌頌給人聽，不得不嚇呆了我，但是更使我驚訝的是兩位××竟也像聽笑話似的若無其事的大笑，他們的責任到底何在，我簡直茫然了！這也許是我對上海還不够了解吧？也許是我還太幼稚，過份的大驚小怪？同車的幾個人不都是一笑置之嗎？但是我連想到了轉瞬冬令將到，在這民生困苦的今日上海，我不得不對冬防担心！</p>
<h3>「識相點·自己人！」</h3>
<p>— 達</p>
<p>在八路電車中，一位衣着體面的乘客被扒了，於是車停下來；這位乘客的幾位同伴，都相帮他抄査，他們也都是衣冠楚楚的體面者流，有兩位還翻捲起白的袖口，或啣着牙籤。</p>
<p>果然，一位鑲了金牙，戴着呢帽的衣冠楚楚者，抓住一個衣冠不十分楚楚的道：</p>
<p>「識相點，拿出來。」</p>
<p>被抓的一個紅了臉，掙扎着</p>
<p>「自己人，說出來好了，沒關係！」衣冠楚楚者們中的兩位，也走上去對着那個紅了臉的被抓的說。</p>
<p>那個見事不妙，祇得眼睛一霎，嘴一歪，即時一位穿了制服冠冕堂皇的司閽×，從衣袋內挖出一大疊鈔票來，紅的·花的·</p>
<p>「拍！」司閽×嘴巴上着了一記。</p>
<p>「他媽的！你也是同黨，早就看出你了。』衣冠楚楚中的一位說。</p>
<p>這個臉也紅了，右額上的五條手指印更是顯色。</p>
<p>「拖下去！拖下去！』一片拖下去之聲，兩個都被拖下電車，被扒的一個也下了車，電車繼續駛行，留下一大堆人在路旁。</p>
<p>「想不到××也竟會是同黨！」一位中年婦人驚嘆地說。</p>
<p>「剛剛駡扒兒手可惡，扒兒手該殺的不就是他麽？」一位少年說。</p>
<p>「你看他穿着制服，嘿，他媽的，早就被我軋出苗頭了！我們是什麽人！他眞是太議頭上動土。」打司閣的一位先生也開口了；他沒下車，這時他仍啣着一根牙斂，在嘴的右端。</p>
<p>於是車廂裏紛紛？</p>
<p>—這已是好多天前的一回事；前天有位友人來吿訴我說，他在公共汽車上也被扒去十萬元，當時他確定一個穿着類似機關職員的人最爲可疑，然而他沒敢去抄他。（這大槪是我這位朋友還沒學會了說：「識相點，自己人」之類的話的緣故！）</p>
<p>這以後，我懂得了在某些時候，我們應該會老練地說幾句「目己人」之類的話，這樣總可以占便宜得多。不過當你們也要應用說「自己人」的時候，得先忖忖是否已學會了翻起白袖口或啣牙籤等……不然將會弄巧成拙。一個有經騐的國民確乎不能不懂得這些個。</p>

<p>留學生錄取的名單發表了，我好奇地把一個個所載錄取生的名單讀完，結果，我郤發現了錄取的公費生和自費生的許多名字裏，有許多都是相同，不但筆劃不差連所欲留學的科目也一樣，這自然不會是同名同姓的巧合，而是學生在考公費後，恐怕自已不會錄取，就再去考自費，以便留一後步，郤那知兩邊都給取了。</p>
<p>我不能非議那幾位雙方都被錄取的學生，但這樣郤佔據了他人的學額，譬如本來公費有一百四十八名的，郤因爲一個人考了兩遍而都錄取，便把成績較次而本來可以取的人的學額給剝奪了，這在本應錄取而結果郤被淘汰的人來看，是多殘酷的事哪！</p>
<p>而這樣對整個的國家也减少了利益假如本來留學回國後的人才應有二千的，然而因一個人抵了二個名，人數就不足了。</p>
<p>考的人存僥倖之心是無過的但這考試發表名單的方法就有懷疑了，我以爲選取人應把取的名字審査一下，是否兩面都考而取了，再可設法看情形而安插，以免重複。名單上是二千人，出國留學的我認爲應實足也是二千人才好。</p>
<h3>巴黎·上海</h3>
<p>— 謝平</p>
<p>少婦·妓女</p>
<p>你要享樂的話，請你到巴黎去！</p>
<p>儘你怎樣想吧！你要用什麼東西享樂？你要用怎樣的方式來享樂，在巴黎決不會沒有的。請你放心。</p>
<p>巴黎是「快樂主義」的消受者。巴黎的人，個個都帶有戲劇般的，小說般的風趣。</p>
<p>這裏有一首咏巴黎的詩：</p>
<p>「且飲酒吧，莫忘快樂，因爲明天怎樣，將來怎樣，</p>
<p>沒有人知道。不要跑，不要辛勞；</p>
<p>請儘情飲吧！分享吧，吃吧，想現在吧！</p>
<p>活着不活着沒有什麼分別。</p>
<p>人生都是如此，只有機運罷了！</p>
<p>你如先得了，這便是宜你的；</p>
<p>你如死了，都是別人的，你就沒有份了！」</p>
<p>要是你能懂得這首詩，那末你是眞正地懂得巴黎了。</p>
<p>有人說巴黎的這種享樂的人生觀是不對的。所以將這次</p>
<p>巴黎淪陷的罪名加在「享樂」的頭上。</p>
<p>如果眞是如此，那末戰後的巴黎，它的人生觀，應該會有一些改變吧！</p>
<p>此起戰前的巴黎，我們的上海是什麽也不及的。只有一樣，上海比巴黎更奢侈，更淫俠，更糜爛！假使說巴黎是初解風趣的少婦的話，那末上海是個不可自救的妓女。</p>
<p>巴黎是得到過敎訓了，上海，也許連反悔一次的機會都會得不到的！</p>

<h3>Mediators Propose Concrete Suggestions: If Both Sides Agree to Peace Talks, They Can Reopen; Stuart Pays Respects to the Chairman for a Long Conversation</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 6th Dispatch] During the informal comprehensive talks, when discussions on political issues achieve success, the Political Consultative Conference Comprehensive Group and the Constitutional Draft Review Committee will be reconvened for approval. This suggestion was decided by the China Democratic League, the Youth Party, and respected figures during a three-hour meeting on the morning of the 6th. In the afternoon, Luo Longji and others visited Zhou Enlai to inform him of this suggestion and reported to the government that they had the determination to reopen peace talks. In the evening, Mo Dehui visited Lei Zhen and Shao Lizi again, formally presenting this opinion. Government representatives decided to discuss the answer at Sun Ke's residence on the morning of the 7th, and will focus on the draft constitution.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 6th Dispatch] As the National Assembly approaches its opening, the situation regarding peace talks has been fluctuating, and it is gradually approaching a critical juncture. It is reported that mediators, after summarizing the recent negotiations, have reached a concrete suggestion. After reaching an agreement on the afternoon of the 6th, it has been submitted to the government. If agreed upon and if the Communist Party has no objections, formal negotiations may commence as early as the 7th, aiming to reach an agreement on everything in the near future. On the mediators' side, the original plan was to hold separate talks with the government and the Communist Party on the issues listed in both the political and military aspects. However, to save time and reduce travel, the negotiation method was changed to having all parties hold informal comprehensive talks and a military three-person group meeting at the same time, discussing political and military issues separately. It is also reported that the issues to be discussed will include the following: "Political": (1) The reorganization of the National Government and the Executive Yuan; (2) The issue of the number and list of delegates to the National Assembly, and the actual start date of the National Assembly's deliberations; (3) The issue of the draft constitution; (4) The issue of local governments inside and outside the customs. "Military": (1) The issue of ceasefire in place; (2) The issue of troop deployment locations; (3) The issue of the Executive Group separately implementing the ceasefire.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 6th Dispatch] Regarding the Third Party's opinions, the government responded this morning through Shao Lizi. The meeting originally scheduled for 3:00 PM was temporarily canceled. China Democratic League representative Zhang Junmai visited Shao again at 7:00 AM this morning for talks. Political Consultative Conference Secretary-General Lei Zhen was present. Shao expressed the government's opinion, not rejecting negotiations, but hoping that the Third Party would propose more concrete methods regarding the negotiation format and procedures.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 6th Dispatch] Sun Ke may return to Nanjing from Shanghai on the morning of the 7th. Liang Shuming left Beijing at 8:00 AM on the 6th, flying to Beiping. Li Huang, Zuo Shunsheng, and Chen Qitian returned to Nanjing from Shanghai on the morning of the 6th.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 6th Dispatch] Ma Si met once on the morning of the 6th. In the afternoon at 6:00 PM, Stuart paid respects to the Chairman for a long conversation.</p>
<p>Key Decisions on the Overall Situation's Development to Be Made in the Next Few Days</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City Dispatch] A certain person from the Third Party, who recently returned to Shanghai from Nanjing, told reporters on the 6th: The key to the peaceful development of the overall situation will be decided in the next few days. The content of the exchanges of opinions in Nanjing among all parties focuses on two points: (1) The eight principles proposed by the government; (2) The issue of the reorganization of the Executive Yuan. Regarding the former, the government and the Chinese Communist Party have already reached an agreement on items (1) and (2), but have not yet signed it. The government has accepted the Third Party's opinions on items (3), (4), and (6), indicating that they can be considered and revised. The distance between the two sides' opinions is not difficult to close. Items (5) and (7) are procedures that must be followed and do not require discussion. Item (8) will not be a problem after the first seven items are resolved. Therefore, the eight principles proposed by the government do not present difficulties during negotiations. As for the latter, the government advocates reorganizing the Executive Yuan after the National Assembly is convened, while the Chinese Communist Party insists that it must be reorganized simultaneously with the National Government. This is only a matter of timing. If both sides can be slightly flexible, there seems to be no reason for dispute. Based on this, although the National Assembly session is only a few days away, the hope for peace in the overall situation is still very optimistic. Therefore, the Third Party is constantly actively mediating, hoping to facilitate the successful opening of the National Assembly.</p>
<p>In addition, regarding the two points of contention in the constitutional draft: (1) The issue of the Executive Yuan being responsible to the Legislative Yuan. (2) The issue of local governments. Before April of this year, during the Political Consultative Conference's Constitutional Draft Review Committee meeting, regarding the former, the government advocated abolishing it, while the Chinese Communist Party insisted on retaining it. In the end, there was a compromise suggestion, that the Executive Yuan would only be responsible to the Legislative Yuan within a certain scope, a limited responsibility rather than a general responsibility. With a little more discussion, a comprehensive opinion can be obtained. Regarding the latter, only slight adjustments need to be made to the articles. There are no major differences. If the Constitutional Draft Review Committee can be convened quickly, then agreeing on the draft constitution will not take much time.</p>
<p>Also, regarding the allocation of committee seats for each party in the reorganized government, the Chinese Communist Party and the China Democratic League originally requested ten seats, but recently expressed that they could consider being flexible. However, the recent informal exchanges of opinions among all parties have not yet achieved satisfactory results. The crux of the matter lies in other factors. The most important thing from now on is for all parties to show sincerity, make concessions to each other, avoid creating unnecessary complications, and seize the time. Then, successfully convening the National Assembly and completing peaceful unification can be realized.</p>
<h3>Central Standing Committee Holds Extraordinary Meeting to Discuss Issues of the National Assembly; Minister Peng Discusses the Impossibility of Postponing the National Assembly</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 6th Dispatch] After today's National Defense Council meeting, an extraordinary meeting of the Central Standing Committee was held. Chairman Yu Youren discussed the National Assembly issue for a long time, and there was also a heated discussion on the issue of all councilors attending the National Assembly.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 6th Dispatch] The Ministry of Information held a press conference at 3:30 PM this afternoon, hosted by Minister Peng Xuepei and Director Ye Gongchao of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The following are Minister Peng's answers to reporters' questions:</p>
<p>Question: Regardless of the attitudes of the Chinese Communist Party or other parties, will the government definitely convene the National Assembly on November 12th?</p>
<p>Answer: The National Assembly was postponed from May 5th to November 12th to accommodate the opinions of the Chinese Communist Party and other parties. Negotiations are still ongoing, hoping for unanimous participation. Now that the representatives have arrived in Nanjing one after another, it is no longer possible to delay it further.</p>
<p>Question: It is reported that Sichuan Provincial Chairman Zhang Qun will succeed as President of the Executive Yuan. What is the plan for reorganizing the Executive Yuan? Has President Song already resigned, or does he plan to resign in the near future? If the reports are not accurate, what is the reason for Chairman Zhang's urgent return to the country?</p>
<p>Answer: I have not heard of any situation that would indicate that President Song intends to resign. After the National Assembly is convened, we can expect the Executive Yuan to further broaden its base. Chairman Zhang Qun currently holds a very important position in the government. He went to the United States for treatment of a neck tumor. Now that the surgery has been successful, his health allows him to return to the country soon.</p>
<h3>Shao Lizi's Remarks</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 6th Dispatch] The preparatory committee for the National Assembly recently announced a new list of staff, with Shao Lizi still serving as chairman. Reporters visited Shao on the 6th to inquire whether his intention to resign, which he had expressed earlier, had been withdrawn. He replied: Because of my poor health, I often feel headaches. The preparatory work for the National Assembly is very heavy, and I am deeply afraid that I will not be able to handle it. Therefore, I sincerely requested to resign. Fortunately, the actual affairs have always been the responsibility of Secretary-General Hong Lanyou. I believe it will not be delayed. The reporter also asked Shao for his opinion on the National Assembly? He replied: Drafting a constitution is closely related to peace and unity. We originally hoped to convene the National Assembly after peace and unity were achieved. Now, we still hope to promote the success of peace and unity by convening the National Assembly. The purpose has not changed, and we just need to continue our efforts.</p>

<p>Question: What is the military situation in Yantai? It is rumored that the National Army landed on the north coast of Shandong with the goal of capturing the port. Is this true?</p>

<p>Question: Reports state that the National Army is advancing towards Dalian. What is the actual situation in that area? What is the progress in recovering Dalian?</p>
<p>Answer: There is no fighting in the Dalian area. Reports that the Communist army shelled Andong from the Soviet-occupied Korean territory across the Yalu River, causing the National Army to retreat from Andong, are completely unfounded.</p>
<p>[Our Jinan Office, 6th Dispatch] The Communist forces besieging Anqiu retreated south on the evening of the 5th, and the city has been relieved. The Communist forces on both the north and south sides of the entire Jiaoji Railway have increased to 180,000.</p>

<h3>National Army Counterattacking Shuyang; Li Mo'an Flew to Yangzhou for Inspection; Wang Maogong Met Li and Transferred to Shaobo</h3>
<p>[Our Zhenjiang Office, 6th Dispatch] It is reported that the National Army from the four areas of Suqian, Siyang, Huaiyin, and Lianshui is now beginning to counterattack Shuyang.

<h3>Hebei to Promote Pacification Work; Plans to Divide the Province into Pacification Zones</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Office, 6th Dispatch] After the National Army opened the Pingbao section, the political center of Hebei is still in Beiping because transportation cannot be restored in the short term. Currently, important political decrees of the Hebei Provincial Government are still issued by the Beiping Office of the Provincial Government. Most of the heads and senior personnel of the various departments and offices also work in Beiping. Acting Secretary-General Shi Desen, Director of the Department of Civil Affairs Sun Zhengbang, Director of the Police Department, and Director of the Health Bureau remain in Baoding. It is learned that before the Pingbao Railway is restored, this situation will be difficult to change. Currently, the most important political task in Hebei is pacification. Sun also serves as the chairman. In the past, the administrative commissioners could not effectively command the troops, and pacification work was difficult to promote. It is planned to temporarily divide the province into four pacification zones: (1) Eastern Hebei (2) Northern Section of the Jinpu Railway (3) Northern Section of the Pinghan Railway (4) Beiping (including the Tongxian area). The pacification work will be carried out with the commander of the stationed troops as the center. Except for the commander of the Eastern Hebei Pacification Zone, who has been appointed to be the 92nd Army Commander Hou Jingru, with the command post set up in Tangshan, the commander of the Northern Section of the Pinghan Railway Pacification Zone has been internally designated as the 94th Army Commander Mu Tingfang. The candidates for the commanders of the remaining two zones are still being considered. In addition, in view of the past inconsistency in the pace of the party, government, and military, which greatly affected work efficiency, it was decided to follow the example of the Xuzhou Pacification Headquarters and establish joint party-government-military offices at both the provincial and county levels. The provincial joint office will be personally presided over by Sun, with one secretary-general, served by the director of the political department of the war zone, and two deputy secretary-generals, served by the secretary-general of the provincial government and the chairman of the provincial party headquarters. The coordination between the party, government, and military will be strengthened and will be implemented soon. Regarding emergency relief, the central government has allocated 500 million yuan, and the Ministry of Social Affairs has dispatched key personnel to the north to assist in distribution. The Hebei Provincial Government believes that the disaster-stricken areas in Hebei Province are very large this time and has telegraphed the central government to request an additional allocation.</p>
<h3>Three Communist Motorboats Arrive in Qingdao to Surrender</h3>

Because the crew members were unwilling to be controlled by the Communist army, they took the opportunity to sneak from Yantai to Qingdao and arrived at noon on the 4th to surrender to the relevant authorities.</p>
<h3>Mine Detonation by Coal Car on Beining Road</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Office, 6th Daily] A coal car detonated a mine on the Beining Road between Changli and Houfengtai at 4:30 AM on the 6th, derailing four cars. Repairs will be completed tonight.</p>

<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 6th Dispatch] It was previously rumored that the Design Bureau, the Party and Government Work Assessment Committee, and the Accounting Office would be merged into the Planning and Assessment Office, still under the National Government. It is learned that this merger plan has been discussed by the government, which believes that there is no need to make any changes for the time being. It is reported that the original proposal has been reserved.</p>
<h3>Chairman Hosts Bierly at Banquet</h3>

<h3>National Federation of Commerce Passes Important Provisional Motion: Urge the Government to Quickly Determine Economic Policies</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 6th] The National Federation of Commerce today passed the following important provisional motion:</p>
<p>Motion: To urge the government to promptly determine economic policies and improve financial measures, focusing on protecting production, developing trade, and stabilizing people's livelihoods to rescue the national industrial and commercial crisis.</p>
<p>Upon investigation, our country's current economic contradictions are numerous, and the industrial and commercial crisis is becoming increasingly serious. The root causes are nothing more than the following:</p>
<p>1.  High inflation, shrinking production, and transportation bottlenecks have led to high prices. Furthermore, high prices have resulted in high-interest loans. Currently, industries and businesses across the country are suffering from the oppression of high-interest loans, like drinking poison to quench thirst, and bankruptcies are frequently heard.</p>
<p>2.  Since the victory, imports have surged, and foreign goods are being dumped in markets everywhere. Domestic nascent industrial products struggle to compete, leading to foreign goods seizing original domestic markets, resulting in business depression and difficulties in maintaining operations.</p>
<p>3.  Because the domestic value of the legal tender is vastly different from its foreign value, the output of special products does not cover costs. This has affected industries such as silk, tea, tung oil, and animal husbandry. Agricultural products are stagnant, the economy is on the brink of bankruptcy, and purchasing power is shrinking, resulting in increasingly narrow sales channels for urban goods.</p>
<p>4.  Current financial policies focus on contraction, and credit is severely restricted for loans genuinely used for production. Furthermore, land cannot be mortgaged, factory buildings cannot be used as collateral, and there are numerous controls. Although called specialized banks, the Agricultural Bank of China is also subject to restrictions on commercial banks. Because the Central Bank has never earnestly handled rediscounting and re-mortgaging, it is difficult to turn around, so it seeks to protect itself carefully, causing finance to lose contact with production, resulting in a disjointed state.</p>
<p>5.  Idle funds flow into the black market. To maintain cost reductions, banks set deposit interest rates too low, resulting in a one-to-ten ratio compared to lending rates. This further discourages social idle funds from being deposited in banks, causing them to flow to the black market, leading to speculation. This not only hinders finance but also promotes the abnormal development of speculative markets.</p>
<p>6.  Donations and taxes are heavy, disregarding the ability of industry and commerce to bear the burden. Instead of cultivating tax sources, they specialize in killing the chicken to get the egg, draining the pond to catch the fish, and apportioning levies and borrowing taxes solely to increase the ratio of collection. As a result, the lifeblood is exhausted, and they are on the verge of death, ultimately leading to work stoppages and closures.</p>
<p>The above are all due to the fact that since the Anti-Japanese War and the postwar recovery, there has been no definite economic policy as a guide. Furthermore, financial measures do not start from supporting production but specialize in blind tightening, leading to this situation. The remedy should be to request the government to show compassion for the people's exhaustion of strength, face the current crisis squarely, and quickly determine economic policies. Furthermore, improve financial measures to ensure that finance and economy are linked, thereby protecting industries, developing trade, and achieving the goals of rescuing the crisis and stabilizing people's livelihoods. All extraordinary wartime economic laws that do not meet the needs of the current era should be abolished. The outlines of various measures are stated as follows:</p>
<p>1.  Regarding the Establishment of Economic Policies</p>
<p>A. Production is the mother of all economic activities. Only with large-scale production can there be substantial trade, wealth distribution, and consumption. Moreover, the government's financial resources also depend on the prosperity of production, only then can annual revenue achieve healthy growth. Therefore, our country's economic policy should focus on conserving and developing production as its central goal.</p>
<p>B. The elements of production are capital, labor, technology, equipment, organization, and management. Our country's industry is nascent, capital is short, technology is backward, equipment is simple, and organization and management are not very strict. To develop production, it is necessary to lay a good foundation in advance. Therefore, as a first step, the government should supervise and effectively assist the gradual enrichment and improvement of private industries, especially in terms of capital, and provide convenience with all its strength.</p>
<p>C. Nascent industries must never be subjected to the dumping attacks of foreign products. Protectionist tariffs must be established to protect necessary national industries, and one must never dig one's own grave in order to appease friendly countries.</p>
<p>D. The division between state-owned and private enterprises should be quickly divided and announced according to the economic construction plan, clearly specifying the types to show the people the truth, and actively proceeding with priorities in a classified manner.</p>
<p>E. The distribution of dividends should be stipulated to be no less than 50% of the bank's interest rate (year-end losses are naturally an exception) to encourage investment. Furthermore, the calculation of wages should be determined by the government for a minimum wage, but the limit should not exceed the employer's ability to bear it, so that both labor and capital can achieve a balance.

<h3>National Federation of Commerce Concludes Successfully; Chairman Chiang Attends and Gives Instructions; The Government Resolves to Go All Out to Solve Difficulties for the Industrial and Commercial Sectors; Hopes the Industrial and Commercial Sectors Can Assist the Government in Developing Transportation</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 6th] The National Federation of Commerce concluded successfully on the 6th after five days of meetings. Chairman Chiang attended the meeting at 4:15 PM and gave instructions, demonstrating the government's concern for the pain of industry and commerce, and resolving to do its best to assist in solving difficulties. Regarding tax issues, he hoped that the business community could assist the government in ensuring that statistical surveys are accurate. If this work can be done, taxation will naturally be balanced. In terms of transportation recovery, he also hoped to assist the government in developing it. The Chairman, wearing a yellow woolen uniform, looked energetic and rosy-cheeked. After arriving, he rested briefly in the lounge, where Wang Xiaolai presented the course of the meeting and the points of expectation of representatives from various places regarding the government. He then entered the meeting hall accompanied by Gu Zhenggang, and the entire hall responded with warm applause. After ascending the stage, Wang Xiaolai presented his respects, and reported that a total of 416 people had registered for the conference, with 301 actually attending, and a total of 504 proposals. The Chairman then gave instructions, briefly stating:</p>
<p>After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, not only is our country's economy and industry lagging behind, and the general public is feeling pain, but the people of other countries also have the same situation. However, our country is particularly painful, especially the industrial and commercial sectors and the people in various places suffering the most. After a year, other countries have roughly gained a clue in the economy, and the economy and transportation have recovered. Only our country has not recovered its transportation due to various reasons, and farmers, businesses, and industries are suffering deeply. The government feels terrified by the heavy burden it bears to the compatriots and the industrial and commercial sectors. In the future, it is determined to do its best to reduce the pain of industry and commerce, and to reduce the pain of compatriots across the country. It is hoped that the national economic circles, especially the leaders who have come from afar, can work with the local governments to cooperate and enable the economy to recover quickly, transportation to recover day by day, and industry and commerce to improve day by day. Transportation is extremely important, and it is hoped that everyone can provide special assistance to develop railways and highways. Secondly, the basis of our industry and commerce cannot be compared with other countries. The biggest reason is that our organization is unsound, lacks statistics, and various economies cannot have a progress and concrete plan to proceed step by step. In addition, the survey is not accurate, and the tax cannot be balanced as a result. In order to seek the sound development of industry and commerce, the tax should seek balance and impartiality, and the suffering of merchants and people can be reduced as a result. The current investigation is inaccurate, and the statistics are inaccurate, so that the rich who should pay taxes are able to avoid paying, and those who should not pay are suffering from the burden of paying taxes. The two ministries of economy and society have been ordered to pay special attention to this matter, but it is still hoped that the society can automatically assist the government in the investigation. After the statistics and investigations are accurate, the suffering of merchants can be reduced (warm applause). This is the most important thing, as the fundamental issue of national construction is also the most important thing for industry and commerce to seek self-development, progress, and soundness. It is hoped that the government can be especially assisted, so that it can soon have a nationwide and practical statistics. Many proposals have been passed at this conference, and I, on behalf of the government, tell you that the government will definitely do its best to reduce the suffering of the national industrial and commercial sectors and solve the current important problems of the industrial and commercial sectors based on what you have proposed (warm applause).</p>
<p>After the speech, Chen Qinshi, a representative from Zhejiang (Mr. Guo Fu's respected father, also the oldest representative at the conference), presented two petitions, one petitioning the government to promptly determine economic policies and rescue the national industrial and commercial crisis, and the other concerning tax matters. The conference requested three points: (1) Please ask the Chairman to issue an order to exempt the profit tax for the 34th year, (2) Permanently exempt the business tax on grain, (3) Severely punish corrupt tax officials. After the Chairman accepted them, he repeatedly said "good." At about 4:30 PM, he left the meeting hall amidst warm applause.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 6th] The National Federation of Commerce held a closing ceremony at 8 o'clock. Government leaders Pan Xulun and all representatives attended. After performing the formalities, Chairman Wang Xiaolai delivered a speech, saying that a total of 504 proposals had been discussed, and they would be handled separately to solve the pain of industry and commerce, eliminate the crisis, and assist the government in economic construction and complete the great cause of national construction. He hoped that all representatives would cooperate and work together to complete the mission. Pan Xulun delivered a speech, saying: The conference proposals make great contributions to the country, society, and commerce. The Ministry of Economic Affairs will carefully study those related to it, and do its best to help solve them, to promote industry and commerce and jointly achieve economic construction goals. Subsequently, Minister Chen of the Organization Department and Director Lu Jingshi of the Social Department delivered speeches. Finally, Qiao Senrong, a representative from Ningxia, gave a reply, and the conference adjourned amidst melodious music.</p>
<h3>Important Resolutions Passed Yesterday: Request the Government to Exempt the Profit Tax; Stop Japanese Ships from Illegally Entering Inland Rivers</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 6th] At the sixth meeting of the National Federation of Commerce on the morning of the 6th, the discussion of proposals continued. When discussing donations and taxes, representatives from various places spoke enthusiastically on the request to exempt the profit tax. All agreed that if this matter could not be done, the conference's mission to alleviate the difficulties of industry and commerce would not be achieved, and the representatives would have made a futile trip, and there would be no way to repay the trust of the people in their respective places. They requested the conference to earnestly submit this to the government and appeal to Chairman Chiang, so as to achieve the goal. Some representatives even suggested suspending payment until the government made a satisfactory reply. The first issue discussed today was 81 financial proposals, most of which were passed smoothly. However, when discussing the proposal submitted by the Ministry of Economic Affairs to give full play to the highly autonomous spirit of commercial organizations to automatically stabilize prices, the representative from Ningxia stood up and said: Everyone wishes for price stability, but the current price increases are all caused by the government's state-owned public utilities raising prices. The Ministry of Economic Affairs does not care about the rising yarn prices of its own China Textile Company, but orders merchants to stabilize prices. I don't know how to stabilize them. We are not profiteers, and our strength is weak. We can only rise and fall according to the prices set by the government. The passionate remarks won a lot of applause. There were a total of 74 proposals related to industrial and commercial organizations, the main ones being the establishment of the China Federation of Commerce Bank, requesting the Central Government to add one National Assembly representative to each of the 51 units attending the National Federation of Commerce, and requesting the Ministry of Communications to strictly order Japanese ships not to illegally enter inland rivers without permission. The conference also made important resolutions on the conscription issue, the main one being that conscription should be collected from the conscripted person's place of residence as a principle. In the afternoon, provisional motions were discussed, the most important one being the motion proposed by Wang Bingjun and 91 representatives from various provinces and cities, including Wang Xiaolai, requesting the government to promptly determine economic policies, improve financial measures, and focus on protecting production, developing trade and stabilizing people's livelihoods to rescue the national industrial and commercial crisis. The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce proposed that in order to rescue the crisis in various industries, the government should grant employers the freedom to adjust employees, which was passed in principle. Detailed measures were left to the Board of Directors for discussion. Another proposal submitted by the association, requesting the relaxation of measures for transporting domestic cotton yarn to the south to benefit production, was resolved to request the Ministry of Economic Affairs to revoke the ban on transporting cotton yarn to the south.</p>
<h3>Declaration of the National Federation of Commerce Conference: Points out Where the Current Pain of Industry and Commerce Lies; And Calls on All Parties to Prioritize the People</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 6th] The declaration of the National Federation of Commerce Conference was passed at the general meeting on the afternoon of the 6th. The declaration is divided into three parts. The first part points out the current pain points of industry and commerce, which are (1) the oppression of high-interest loans, (2) the dumping of foreign goods, (3) the depression of general business, (4) the heavy burden of donations and taxes, (5) the blockage of transportation, (6) the high cost of wages, (7) the shortage of power machinery and technicians; therefore, the following suggestions are made to the government: (1) to promptly determine economic policies; (2) to improve financial measures, abolish the Four Joint Offices, and the Central Bank to conduct rediscount transfers; (3) to establish a protectionist trade policy; (4) to clear transportation and promote inter-provincial trade; (5) to abolish the newly added commodity tax, simplify tax collection procedures, prohibit new levies, and fairly handle enemy and puppet properties. Secondly, the mission of the association and the working direction after the meeting are proposed as follows: (1) To support national policies, promptly promulgate laws and regulations, and lead national industrial and commercial figures to implement government economic measures; (2) To report the suffering of industry and commerce, relay it to the government, and request improvement, so that the lower situation can be communicated upward and eliminate the separation between the government and the people; (3) To establish industrial and commercial economic research institutions in the national economic center, and recruit economic experts from home and abroad to cooperate with the association, so that the association can establish the staff headquarters of the industrial and commercial sector, and theory and practice can be combined into one, and engage in nationwide economic investigation, reporting and design work for the reference of the association's members and people from all walks of life; (4) Moreover, the economic crisis that our country has encountered before still needs to be actively planned and rescued by us. The association should communicate the strength of the government and industrial and commercial circles in various places to jointly implement various standard programs for relief; (5) Overseas Chinese work hard to start businesses through diligence and thrift. In addition, they have suffered discrimination and oppression from the local government over the years, and their situation is very difficult. The association should communicate with the government and overseas Chinese industrial and commercial circles and strive to provide assistance to protect the interests of overseas Chinese and develop China's overseas economic power. Finally, the association calls on all parties and factions to prioritize the people, abandon prejudices, cooperate sincerely, turn swords into ploughshares, and turn戾气 into auspiciousness, so that the foundation of industrial and commercial enterprises can be laid, and the great plan of nation-building can be seen early.</p>

<h3>Chief Engineer of the Yellow River Restoration Project, Todd, Discusses Recent Developments in River Management: At Least Three to Four More Months Required for Completion</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Todd, Chief Engineer of the UNRRA Yellow River Breach Closure and Embankment Restoration Project, said when meeting with reporters yesterday afternoon: "In 1938, the National Army breached the Yellow River near Huayuankou in Zhengzhou for strategic reasons, flooding two million mu of farmland in Henan and Anhui provinces. In December of last year, Todd, who was then working in the US Army Corps of Engineers, was invited by UNRRA to come to China to oversee the Yellow River restoration project. Todd is a river defense expert who came to China as early as 1919 to participate in the work of repairing the dikes of the Grand Canal. After that, he specialized in the study of the Yellow River issue. In 1941, he won the Rowland Prize from the American Society of Civil Engineers for his writings on the Yellow River issue. He is truly the most ideal candidate to preside over the Yellow River restoration project."</p>
<p>Reasons for the Project Delay</p>
<p>Todd said: "The Chinese government has expressed to UNRRA that if the Yellow River restoration project can be completed as soon as possible, wheat production can be increased by more than one million tons within a year. Therefore, UNRRA is urging it vigorously, and Todd set off for China immediately, happily seeing the Yellow River again after more than ten years of separation. The project officially started on March 1. It was originally intended to be completed before the summer flood season at the end of June this year. The work progressed smoothly in the months of April, May, June, and July, but the UNRRA river management equipment failed to arrive on time, and local labor and materials were insufficient. In addition, the government requested guarantees that the railway would not be damaged when transporting these heavy materials, and the Chinese Communists also requested UNRRA to make proper arrangements for the relief of 250,000 residents in the old channel (90% of which is in the Chinese Communist controlled area) after the Yellow River was diverted to the new channel because the residents would inevitably be displaced when the channel was restored. Therefore, for various reasons, the project was delayed. On June 28, the Yellow River flood began, washing away the railroad, and most of the work had to be stopped."</p>
<p>"In late October, the water level had receded, so work resumed in early November. The National Government has also ordered the Yellow River Conservancy Commission to complete all work by January 5. However, judging from Todd's tone, he actually thought the deadline was too tight. According to his estimate, although the project is now being stepped up, it will still take at least three to four months."</p>
<p>Difficulties in River Management</p>
<p>Todd said: "The difficulty in river management lies in the fact that the project includes areas controlled by the government and the Chinese Communists. The embankment restoration project in the Chinese Communist-controlled area is currently 80% complete. The wages of river workers in that area are exactly the same as those of river workers in Henan Provincial Government territory. In mid-July of this year, Zhou Enlai, Jiang Tingfu, and UNRRA's Plass met four times to discuss the relief of 250,000 residents in the old channel. At that time, Todd also participated in the talks. At that time, the government paid the equivalent of US$16 million for relief, part of which was in materials and part of which was in cash. This matter has not been completely resolved. UNRRA's representative in China, General Edgerton, is making every effort to mediate, and Todd hopes to reach a satisfactory agreement in the next few days to facilitate the work."</p>
<p>Still a Stopgap Measure</p>
<p>Todd said that 300 miles of the entire project are in the Chinese Communist-controlled area, and 30 to 40 miles are in the territory of the Henan Provincial Government. The total cost of the project is estimated at between US$15 million and US$18 million. After the project is completed, China's annual wheat production can be increased by 7.5 million dan and rice production can be increased by 13.8 million dan. Todd said that limited by China's current economic capabilities, the current project is still a stopgap measure. If we want to fundamentally solve the Yellow River disaster, we must have several experts conduct detailed research on the ground for many years, settle on a plan, and collect huge sums of money before we can succeed. According to Todd's estimation, this will take at least ten years and cost hundreds of millions of US dollars."</p>
<h3>Negotiations on Relieving Refugees in Communist-Controlled Areas Have Not Reached an Agreement</h3>
<p>Dong Biwu Talks About His Mission to Shanghai</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Chinese Communist representative Dong Biwu told reporters yesterday that his trip was specifically to negotiate the relief of 250,000 refugees in the Chinese Communist area during the Yellow River embankment restoration. He met with UNRRA General Edgerton and Ho Baoshu, Director of the Executive Yuan Relief Administration, yesterday, but no agreement was reached. He may continue talks in Nanjing in the next few days. When Zhou Enlai came to Shanghai this summer, he discussed with Jiang Tingfu, Xue Dubi, and the then Acting Director of the UNRRA Representative Office in China, Mr. Lai, and agreed to allocate 15 billion yuan, part of which was in materials. It was originally scheduled to pay 4 billion yuan per month in August, September, and October, and 3 billion yuan in November, but so far not a single cent has been paid, and Director Ho said that he knew nothing about it and suggested discussing it again in Beijing. Dong said that the relief supplies needed by the Chinese Communists were clothing, medicine, and agricultural tools, and there was also a shortage of farming cattle. He also said that there were still 200 dangerous projects in the Chinese Communist area that had not been reviewed.</p>

<h3>The Chamber of Commerce Passes a Provisional Motion; Above Text Continues from the First Page</h3>
<p>2.  Regarding Improving Financial Measures:</p>
<p>A.  Quickly establish land finance, actively use cooperatives to carry out large-scale low-interest agricultural loans to save rural areas. A warehouse system should be established as soon as possible, and cooperative organizations should be established and connected with the Farmers Bank of China, in order to strengthen the foundation of the rural economy. The Farmers Bank should fulfill its special mission as a specialized bank, cooperate with the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry to establish a concrete plan to revitalize rural areas and support the production and marketing of agricultural products, and allocate funds as needed without any restrictions.</p>
<p>B.  All banks should quickly establish large-scale low-interest industrial loans and allow machinery and real estate as collateral. It should not be limited to half the price of raw materials and finished products as the sole collateral for loans. The conditions should not be too harsh, and the procedures should be simplified.</p>
<p>C.  The Central Bank must truly act as the bank of banks, not engage in the business of ordinary banks. It should freely engage in rediscounting and re-mortgaging for legitimate loans for production and marketing, and not promote its business solely from a commercial perspective.</p>
<p>D.  The organization of the Four Joint Offices may have been necessary during the war, but the cumbersome loan procedures and lack of timeliness have caused great pain to the industrial and commercial sectors. To this day, the country views it as a major obstacle to reconstruction and development. It should be abolished immediately so that each bank can maintain its independence, complete its specialization, be classified, and be responsible for assisting industrial and commercial development, production, and trade.</p>
<p>E.  In terms of concept, do not misunderstand that the lending of production funds, which can indeed be used to increase production, is an inflation of currency. In fact, the proper use of funds to increase production has the actual effect of contracting currency and balancing prices. This is the basic concept of industrial finance and should be noted.</p>
<p>F.  It should be stipulated that the difference between deposit interest and overdue interest of banks should not be too large, so that deposit interest and overdue interest are close to each other, so as to collect social idle funds and put them into legitimate uses. The Central Bank should use the rediscount rate to gradually suppress interest rates, eliminate the black market, reduce production and marketing costs, and stabilize prices.</p>
<p>3.  Regarding Trade and Foreign Exchange:</p>
<p>A.  Based on the principle of protecting industry, the government should adopt a protective tariff policy as soon as possible. The tariffs on imported goods should be increased for the industries that should be protected to regulate them.</p>
<p>B.  Agricultural materials needed by the government and agricultural materials related to barter debt repayment should be purchased by the government according to the cost of production plus a reasonable profit to maintain production, even if a slight subsidy is needed.</p>
<p>C.  At present, domestic transportation is obstructed, and freight rates are surprisingly high, which often increases costs, stimulates prices, and makes it impossible to compete for exports. Freight rates should be reduced and exempted by category. State-owned transportation agencies should aim to develop trade, not solely focus on profits. Regarding transportation, maritime transport in the northeastern provinces and cities should be restored as soon as possible. The number of ships to Taiwan, South China, and North China should be increased as much as possible. Inland waterways and highway traffic should be dredged and repaired as much as possible to ensure the smooth flow of goods, communicate inter-provincial trade, balance prices in various places, promote the export of domestic specialties, and compete for the international market.</p>
<p>D.  The Nanyang market used to be the end of Japanese goods. Our country should seize this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to export cotton and silk fabrics as soon as possible to ensure the Nanyang market. All subsidy methods such as financing, interest reduction, and subsidies should be adopted as much as possible according to actual needs.</p>
<p>E.  For the investigation, guidance, and management agencies for developing foreign trade, such as the former Bureau of Industry and Commerce Visits, the Bureau of International Trade, and the Trade Committee organized during the Anti-Japanese War, we should adopt their strengths and make up for their shortcomings, and re-establish them to guide merchants in developing trade.</p>
<p>F.  Overseas Chinese work hard overseas. In the past, due to internal troubles and weakness, protection was ineffective. Now that our country has become one of the great powers, we must not allow insults or injuries to occur in the places where overseas Chinese reside. In addition, overseas Chinese work hard all year round, and the remittances they earn back to the country are a huge gain for our country's international balance of payments. We should provide them with as much convenience as possible and not allow them to suffer losses. We should order the overseas remittance agencies to pay attention to improvement at any time.</p>
<p>G.  The government should assist the private sector in purchasing new machinery from foreign countries to increase industrial equipment, and purchase industrial raw materials that cannot be supplied domestically. For all kinds of foreign exchange needed, the government should provide them with as much convenience as possible in terms of time limits and procedures, and give them full convenience according to actual needs. In addition, surplus materials transferred from friendly countries should be sold to merchants at open and fair prices. Those that meet industrial needs should be preferentially allocated to factories in the industry to encourage them.</p>
<p>4.  Regarding Donations, Taxes, and Others:</p>
<p>A.  At present, taxes and levies are heavy, which affects industrial production. The government should consider reducing or exempting commodity taxes. The business stamp tax should be stopped immediately. Tax rates that are too high should be reduced. Direct taxes should be simplified and levied to avoid harassment and embezzlement. Other illegal apportionments and requisitions in various places should be strictly prohibited.</p>
<p>B.  At present, there is a lack of power in various places, which affects production. The government should plan the overall situation, import generators from foreign countries as soon as possible, and effectively encourage private operation.</p>
<p>It is proposed that the government adopt and implement the above suggestions one by one, and hope that the government will hold a national economic conference, where the competent ministries and departments of the government will invite experts, scholars, and representatives of this association to participate together, so as to promote the implementation of the new post-war economic policy, complete economic construction, and stabilize people's livelihoods. Whether it is feasible, please decide publicly.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>How to Suppress High-Interest Loans?</h3>
<p>There is a public call from all levels of society to ban high-interest loans. The factual manifestations, or those in writing, are roughly the following:</p>
<p>(1) According to the Banking Deposit and Loan Management Regulations, the maximum interest rate is set by the local banking industry in various places, and reported to the local central bank for approval and implementation.</p>
<p>(2) In addition to the approved interest rate, no clever names may be created to collect additional fees.</p>
<p>(3) Crack down on underground money houses and prohibit general commercial firms from concurrently operating deposit and loan businesses.</p>
<p>(4) The central bank uses its financial power to gradually suppress market interest rates.</p>
<p>(5) National banks and bureaus appropriately release low-interest loans and undertake rediscount and re-mortgage businesses.</p>
<p>The above items (1), (2), and (3) are passive means; items (4) and (5) are active means. In this way, both the symptoms and the root causes are treated, and the authorities cannot be considered not to be working hard. However, what is the actual effect? The usual lending rate is still around 15%, and exceeding 20% is also often heard. Those forced to collapse by high-interest loans have recently emerged one after another, and the profits of general industry and commerce that have been completely exploited by high-interest loans are even more common. It can be seen that the above measures are either disobeying in public and obeying in private, ineffective in promotion, or are addressing the symptoms but not the root cause, and are of no help.</p>
<p>The fact is very obvious that various production loans have now been decided to be temporarily suspended, and the policy of tightening money supply and tightening currency is still consistently adhered to. In addition, the huge monthly tax revenue and the large-scale bidding and selling of materials and enemy-puppet industries all make the chips circulating in the market decrease rather than increase, and the Shanghai sources are recovered. Then, even if the above two active measures are not just empty talk, will their effectiveness not be completely offset?</p>
<p>Everyone knows that interest rates, like prices in general, are high or low entirely subject to the law of supply and demand. It is an extremely subtle thing to try to suppress interest rates while trying to tighten the money supply. Moreover, even though the money supply is tightening, prices are still soaring. Looking at the cost of living index announced by the municipal government is an ironclad proof. Since prices are high, the required intermediaries - currency - will naturally increase. At present, however, the currency is tight, and prices are rising. Other various expenses such as donations, taxes, wages, electricity, transportation, and even postal and telecommunications fees are almost all increasing. In this contradictory and complex state, how can high-interest loans be suppressed?</p>
<p>Therefore, if the authorities really want to suppress high-interest loans, we believe that in addition to seriously promoting the above five measures, the following points must also be implemented:</p>
<p>(1) Effectively suppress prices, especially saving all kinds of expenses of political and military agencies, and fundamentally reduce the amount of chips needed. Because the government is still the largest consumer at present.</p>
<p>(2) Temporarily return all or part of the deposit reserve of commercial firms in the central bank to increase the head of the various firms that can be rotated.</p>
<p>(3) Whether it is the lending amount or the lending procedures of the central bank or other national banks, they should be relaxed as much as possible. As long as it is convenient for industrialists and merchants to finance, the high-interest loans on the market will be suppressed without being suppressed.</p>
<p>The above are all necessary emergency measures; and the most important and fundamental method is still to use all efforts to stabilize the value of the currency, increase the general public's belief in legal currency, and make them happy to "save," directly increase deposits, and indirectly increase chips. Moreover, if the belief in the value of the currency is high, then the wind of speculation and hoarding will disappear, prices will also fall, and the market can be expected to stabilize. This discussion seems too ordinary; but you must know that the suppression of high-interest loans is an extremely ordinary thing, and you can only think from the ordinary to be effective and without drawbacks.</p>
<h3>Criticism of the New Japanese Constitution</h3>
<p>The draft Japanese constitution, after more than three months of discussion in the parliament, was finally promulgated by Emperor Hirohito on the 3rd of this month, and will be implemented six months later. The Japanese people after the defeat were no different from being mired in darkness, so that even the most stubborn Japanese had to feel pessimistic about the future; but to this day, only a little over a year has passed, and a new constitution has been promulgated, and soon they can embark on the road of peace and democracy. In the eyes of the Japanese people, not only do they feel that the future of their motherland is promising, but from now on their self-confidence can also be completely restored. Therefore, the Japanese are very proudly boasting that this new constitution is "the highest standard constitution in the world." Supreme Allied Commander General MacArthur also declared: "The new Japanese constitution is a major step towards world peace, friendship, and normalcy." In other European countries, the perception of the new Japanese constitution is that the promulgation of the new Japanese constitution is enough to symbolize Japan's hope of starting to get on the right track.</p>
<p>Recalling that after Japan surrendered last year, the Allied powers repeatedly announced the purpose of controlling Japan, which was to democratize Japanese politics and make it one of the peace-loving countries in the world, no longer invading other countries and threatening world peace and security; MacArthur, based on this policy, moved step by step towards the goals set by the Allied powers, whether it was the disarmament of the armed forces, the withdrawal of defense, the closure of the munitions industry, the reorganization of heavy industry, and the re-education of the people, to thoroughly eliminate the Japanese people's aggressive thinking, all of which have achieved considerable success. This promulgation of the new constitution is another major step forward for the democratization of Japanese politics, which no one denies. However, studying the content of this new constitution, there are many uniquely innovative places. The full text has a total of 103 articles, but to summarize, it is nothing more than the following characteristics: (1) maintaining the Japanese Emperor as a symbol of national unity; (2) the parliament still adopts a bicameral system; (3) implementing universal suffrage, and women also have the right to vote; (4) declaring the rights and obligations of the people and their basic democratic freedoms; (5) declaring that war is not used as a tool to promote national policy. Comparing this with the "Imperial Constitution," no matter from which angle it is observed, it has made great progress, and it is truly an epoch-making democratic constitution for Japan. However, in our view, the promulgation and implementation of the new Japanese constitution is not worth overemphasizing, and we must still take a considerable reserved attitude toward Japanese politics in the future.</p>
<p>First, the preamble to the new Japanese constitution states: "The Japanese people hope for lasting peace, and have full confidence in the noble consciousness of maintaining human relations; we are determined to entrust our security and survival to the justice and the good faith of the peace-loving people of the world. We wish to restore our inherent glorious position in the international community and devote ourselves to maintaining peace and abolishing autocracy; and recognize that all people have the right to live in peace and have freedom from terror and want." At the same time, Chapter 2 stipulates the method of renouncing war and rearmament, declaring that Japan yearns for international peace based on justice and order, and opposes the use of war as a tool to promote national policy. Although these clauses are full of the atmosphere of peace and democracy, and are uniquely innovative, enough to set a precedent for other countries to draft new constitutions in the future; but is this new constitution the true intention of the Japanese people? Is it disguised peace? Is it disguised democracy? Empty words are not enough to believe; it depends on the actual situation in Japan in the future? Japan must strive vigorously on the road of democratic innovation to complete the various principles stipulated in the constitution. Today, countries around the world not only hope that Japan will replace the old bottle with a new label; but also hope that Japan's internal political institutions can have a thorough transformation.</p>
<p>Second, a good constitution must be suitable for its national conditions. Turning over the political systems of various countries, they are all the result of natural evolution over hundreds of years, each with its own characteristics and shortcomings, and there is no absolute superiority or inferiority. However, if the constitution of Country A is implemented in Country B, it cannot be implemented because it is not suitable for Country B's national conditions. Comparing the content of the new Japanese constitution with the actual life of the Japanese people, it is no different from going in opposite directions. Therefore, we really dare not have too much extravagant hope for the future of this constitution. The Yorkshire Post of the United Kingdom commented on the new Japanese constitution, saying that "the new constitution promulgated in Tokyo is not the Japanese constitution, but the American constitution." Although this comment is inevitably too extreme; but it also has considerable truth, worthy of deep consideration by MacArthur himself and the American authorities.</p>
<p>Third, although the new Japanese constitution is full of beautiful ideals, its purpose is only to make others believe that Japan is already a peaceful and democratic country; but in reality, Japan's potential power is still preserved; Japan has only been more than a year since its surrender, and Japan has been striving vigorously day and night in silence, and is about to restore its old appearance. Not only will its manufactured products flood the world market, but it will also restore its inherent position in the international community. However, Japan's revival and re-emergence not only make China deeply uneasy, but also threaten peace in the Far East. Therefore, we must not ignore Japan's potential power, which is restless under the smoke screen of peace and democracy and attempts to make a comeback, and we should be especially vigilant; and take precautions at any time.</p>

<h3>Wujin Central Trust Bureau and Enemy Property Office Sell Scrap Iron Fraud Case; Transferred to Wuxi for Trial after More Than Two Months of Delay</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Wuxi News] The case of the Central Trust Bureau and the Enemy Property Disposal Bureau in Wujin, which caused a sensation for selling a large amount of scrap iron fraudulently, was accepted for trial by the Procuratorate of the Local Court of this county at 3:00 p.m. on the 5th under orders. The defendants were Zhao Shuyi, director of the Changzhou branch of the Enemy Property Disposal Bureau, Yun Junshi, director of the Wujin branch of the Central Trust Bureau, Cha Bingchu, chairman of the Dyeing and Weaving Industry Association, and Zhu Daoming. The respondents, including Shi Xuren, deputy speaker of the Wujin Provisional Senate, Sheng Xingfu, secretary-general of the county party headquarters, and Yu Yiqin and Meng Jutang, also arrived in court as summoned. On the Procuratorate side, due to the major corruption case involved, Chief Prosecutor Ma personally opened the court. It is reported that on August 18 this year, the Wujin Office of the Central Trust Bureau, entrusted by the Changzhou Branch of the Enemy Property Disposal Bureau, sold a large amount of scrap iron. The scrap iron was identified by members of the Wujin Dyeing and Weaving Industry Association as including items that had been forcibly requisitioned by the enemy army, totaling more than 360 tons. The manufacturers had already discovered the original items and could not sit idly by and let them be sold. The association sent a letter to the Wujin Office of the Central Trust Bureau requesting a temporary suspension of the sale. On the one hand, it submitted a letter to the county government requesting a transfer to prevent the opening of the bidding. However, at that time, the Wujin Office of the Central Trust Bureau did not approve it and still held the bidding on the original date. Members of the Dyeing and Weaving Association requested to participate in the bidding, but were not allowed to do so. On the same day, 500 tons of scrap iron were sold by bidding. Director Zhao of the Enemy Property Office entrusted Zhu Daoming to estimate the price in advance, at 40,000 yuan per ton. As a result of the bidding, Meng Jutang of Zhenhua Iron Factory won the bid with 91,400 yuan per ton. Later, for the property rights relationship of its members, the Dyeing and Weaving Association petitioned the Wujin County Provisional Senate to quickly seek effective prevention. After receiving the petition, the association believed that the case was highly suspicious and sent the entire case to the Wujin District Procuratorate for investigation. Subsequently, the relevant persons were summoned to the court, and after several interrogations, it has been delayed for more than two months and has not yet been resolved. Later, the Wujin District Court submitted an application to the High Court to transfer the case to the Wuxi District Court for handling. The court hearing lasted for four hours that day, and ended at around 7 o'clock. As a result, Chief Prosecutor Ma believed that there was insufficient suspicion and ordered all of them to be sent back for verification.</p>

<h3>Director of Jiangsu Provincial Field and Grain Office Inspects Grain Collection, Convenes Business Review Meeting in Suzhou</h3>
<p>[Report from our Suzhou Office, 6th] Mr. Hong Qishen, Director of the Jiangsu Provincial Field and Grain Office, recently arrived in Suzhou from Zhenjiang with his staff to guide grain collection. Our reporter visited the hotel to inquire about the situation of grain collection in Jiangsu Province, and received the following statement: The government, in view of the needs of military, political, economic, and social aspects, has decided to continue collecting grain in kind for this year's field tax, hoping to meet military needs and control a large amount of grain to regulate grain prices nationwide. The original tax amount in this province was more than 38 million yuan, which was collected at 40%, equivalent to more than 3.8 million shi of rice, more than 37,400 shi of wheat, and more than 13.76 billion yuan in legal tender. The standards for converting the tax are determined according to the actual production situation in each region. Specifically, Tongshan and Donghai counties collect wheat, and Nanhui, Taicang, Jiading, Fengxian, Baoshan, Nantong, and Shanghai counties collect cotton. However, legal tender is actually collected for the conversion. The remaining 28 counties, including Suzhou, Wujiang, Wuxi, Changshu, Jiangyin, Songjiang, Kunshan, Yixing, Danyang, Qingpu, Zhenjiang, Liyang, Jiangning, Jintan, Jurong, Liuhe, Jinshan, Jiangdu, Chongming, Piaoshui, Taixian, Jiangpu, Gaochun, Chuansha, Yangzhou, Yizheng, Jingjiang, and Changzhou, all collect rice. Standard market scales are uniformly distributed by the provincial office after being verified by local legal entities to prevent malpractice. The reporter then inquired about the grain collection in the newly recovered areas in northern Jiangsu, and received the answer: Of the 38 counties and cities in northern Jiangsu, except for Jiangdu and other 8 counties and cities that have not been affected by war, which collect grain as usual, the remaining 30 counties are full of scars and almost reduced to scorched earth. The provincial government has telegraphed the Executive Yuan for exemption, which may be approved, to give farmers in northern Jiangsu a chance to recuperate. Mr. Hong also stated at the end: Grain collection is expected to be the norm this year, and it may be possible to restore the old system before the war next year. Mr. Hong convened a meeting of all district chiefs and cadres at all levels in the county government yesterday to hold a review meeting on field and grain affairs, and a concrete plan has been discussed for the development of the work. He will soon transfer to Wujiang, Danyang, and Kunshan counties to inspect and supervise.</p>

<h3>Peng Zhaoxian Talks with Senators in Hangzhou</h3>
<p>[Report from our Hangzhou Office, 6th] Peng Zhaoxian, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Interior, held separate symposiums with members of the Zhejiang Provincial and Hangzhou City and County Councils in Hangzhou on the 5th to listen to reports. Statements were made on issues such as financial difficulties and disregard for public opinion. The fact that soldiers clearing the countryside assaulted members of the Hangzhou County Council, and police officers of the Second Branch assaulted members of the City Council, and the perpetrators were not punished, aroused strong resentment among the senators. They also requested Peng to find a way to designate a meeting place for the Hangzhou City Council, to correct the forceful control and rogue behavior of police officers, to stop usury, to find ways to circulate funds to benefit the revival of industry and commerce, to quickly restore Zhejiang Hospital and Hangzhou Medical School, to explicitly order temples to be borrowed as school buildings, to strengthen the power of the council, to improve the level of township work, and to request the central government to allocate funds to dredge the West Lake, etc. Vice Minister Peng promised to forward the requests for review and improve the situation as soon as possible.</p>

<h3>Letter to the Editor</h3>
<p>To the Editor: Having recently read a "Wuxi News" item in your newspaper on the 3rd of this month, reporting on a conflict between students of the 17th Army Officer Corps and Wuxi Railway Police, the content is completely inconsistent with the facts. I am writing to detail the actual course of events as follows: On November 1st, Luo Biao, a student from the 42nd Company of the 6th Battalion of the 17th Corps (originally stationed in Shitangwan), came to the Corps headquarters to complete his discharge procedures. When returning to his unit, while passing through the station, he saw a railway policeman beating an old woman from the countryside and arbitrarily insulting her. Student Luo Biao, deeply disturbed by this, stepped forward to offer some gentle advice, but the railway policeman was rude and unreasonable, and argued back, leading to a quarrel. Many people on the platform gathered upon hearing the noise and rushed forward without asking the reason, surrounding and beating Student Luo Biao, and detaining him in the Wuxi Police Team. At that time, a few students at the station heard the news and came to help, intending to rescue their detained classmate with their bare hands. Unexpectedly, the railway police officers and soldiers, relying on their weapons, acted as if facing a formidable enemy, firing their guns incessantly. At that time, Commander Tao happened to be attending a meeting at the Wuxi City Defense Headquarters, and rushed to the scene to stop it, in order to avoid causing trouble. However, the railway police officers still did not put away their weapons and ignored Commander Tao's persuasion. Commander Tao first ordered the students to leave the station and sent the injured students to Puren Hospital for treatment, and Deputy Commander Chen and both parties resolved the matter, and the matter came to an end. Unexpectedly, the next day, a few students brought their families to Wuxi for shopping, and as soon as they got off the train, another misunderstanding occurred with the railway police there, who immediately opened fire, and a student from our corps was injured and fell to the ground, and the order on the platform was in chaos. Later, Commander Tao rushed to the scene again to restore order and await resolution. Commander Tao specially went to each battalion for several consecutive days to earnestly instruct each student, who all obeyed orders and remained in their units, and there was no undisciplined action. Unexpectedly, yesterday, a few newspapers at sea published news that was completely contrary to the facts. The manuscript was clearly inconsistent with the facts. It is found that all officers of the Army Officer Corps are adhering to the national plan for nation-building and military reorganization, and are obeying orders to be demobilized. They should have been properly resettled by the state long ago, but since the victory, the political situation has been unsettled and internal strife has continued, so the plan for military demobilization has not been completed as scheduled. Most soldiers have been under training for nearly a year, with difficult lives and mental distress, but most can remain calm and self-disciplined. Even if one or two people act slightly differently, it is difficult to avoid in human nature. Soldiers have always received meager treatment, and when interacting with the people, they inevitably have the trouble of borrowing housing and furniture, and riding third- and fourth-class trains without tickets, which has caused them to be despised by society, indifferent to the suffering of soldiers, and often enjoy reading "soldiers causing trouble" news, which is really regrettable! Soldiers fought for eight years in the War of Resistance, shedding blood and sweat. After the victory, they were suddenly demobilized, and not only were they not sympathized with by society, but they were cursed by the people. We, officers at all levels, have tried our best to advise and exhort them on their situation and mood, and we sincerely hope that our journalists will show them sympathy and guidance. (Zhang Fangcheng, Commander of the Second Battalion, Representative of Students of the 17th Army Officer Corps of the Central Training Corps)</p>

<h3>Latest News</h3>
<p>[Report from our office] Paris, 6th - Urgent broadcast from Washington: According to the latest reports received, Republicans have won 236 seats in the House of Representatives, and Democrats have 169 seats. In the Senate, Republicans have 49 seats, and Democrats have 42 seats.</p>
<h3>The Trend of US Congressional and State Elections Confirmed, Republican Victories Frequent, Democrats Have Lost Control of Both Houses</h3>
<p>[Report from our office] San Francisco, 6th - Broadcast: According to incomplete statistics at 9:00 AM today (8:00 PM Shanghai time), of the 435 members of the House of Representatives to be elected, Democrats have been elected to 169 seats and Republicans have been elected to 209 seats. Democrats have an advantage in 20 seats, and Republicans have an advantage in 35 seats. (218 seats are needed to have a majority in the House of Representatives.) Of the 36 senators to be elected in the Senate (the total number of senators is 96), Democrats have been elected to 10 seats and holdovers have 32 seats, totaling 42 seats; Republicans have been elected to 21 seats and holdovers have 28 seats, totaling 49 seats. Of the 34 governors to be elected, Democrats have been elected to 10 seats and Republicans have been elected to 20 seats.</p>
<p>[Report from our office] San Francisco, 6th - Broadcast: After winning 49 seats in the Senate, the Republican Party has been able to control the Senate, with 5 seats still undecided.</p>
<p>[Report from our office] San Francisco, 6th - Broadcast: President Truman has been completely abandoned by his hometown of Missouri. At the same time, the state now has two Republican senators who will be candidates for vice president, which is unprecedented since the American Civil War. As this bad news spread, Truman was on a night train returning to Washington from Independence City. Not only was Truman's own position taken by the Republicans, but also his hand-picked candidate, Acheson, was defeated by the Republican candidate, Ives.</p>
<h3>Dewey Wins New York Governorship</h3>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 6th] The Republican Party, with the slogan "The American people have clearly had enough," has gained a very clear advantage in the House elections. The Republican Party also claims to have obtained a majority of seats in the Senate election, enough to overwhelm the Democratic Party. Although the final results have not yet been fully tallied, the absolute advantage of the Republican Party seems to be beyond doubt by this morning. The most surprising result was the re-election of New York Governor Dewey, who won more than 500,000 votes more than his opponent, an unprecedented record. Dewey's becoming the Republican candidate in the 1948 presidential election seems to be a sure thing. After his victory, he said: "The American people have indicated that what they want is not a government that tries to become the master of the people, but a government that serves the people. In this election, the people are choosing between two governments of different natures and different doctrines." In the New York Senate election, there was a surprise upset. The Democratic candidate, Lehman, the first director of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, was defeated by the little-known Ives. The Republican Party also gained ground in the southern states, which have traditionally been Democratic strongholds. Bricker, a strong competitor of Dewey in the Republican presidential nomination race, also won a record number of votes in Ohio and was elected as a senator. Warren, another strong competitor of Dewey in the party, was also re-elected as Governor of California without difficulty.</p>
<h3>Future of Congress</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 6th] The biggest problem facing the next Congress, which will almost certainly be controlled by the Republican Party, will be wartime controls on the economy and legislative proposals to ease labor-management friction. Republican leaders have long anticipated that this election could restore the glory of fifteen years ago and regain control of both houses, so they have scheduled a series of meetings before the opening of the 80th Congress on January 3 next year to determine policy. However, because Democrats still firmly occupy the White House, Republicans must either persuade President Truman to accept their program or find enough votes to pass legislation to override the President's veto. This is no easy task and requires a two-thirds majority in both houses. Each house must decide the following questions: (1) The extension of conscription is due to expire on March 15 next year, and closely related to this issue is the government's firm insistence on implementing a permanent compulsory training program, which will spark heated debate. (2) The merger of the Army and Navy is another issue, which the government will face sharp opposition from the Navy. (3) Accelerating the housing construction program is another major challenge, especially for housing for veterans. (4) Reduce high wartime tax rates. (5) Reduce government spending and balance the budget, which the Republican Party will receive assistance from the Democratic Party. Congressman Martin is expected to become Speaker of the House. Because the Republican Party has an advantage in Congress, President Truman may once again propose most of the programs inherited from Roosevelt, advocating the establishment of a permanent Internal Fair Employment Committee, the abolition of poll taxes as a voting requirement in federal elections, the construction of the St. Lawrence Seaway, and the expansion of social security laws.</p>
<p>Soviet Red Star Newspaper Comments on US Elections</p>
<p>[United Press, Moscow, 5th] The Red Star newspaper today commented on the US elections, saying that there is no longer much difference between the Democratic and Republican parties in the United States, as can be seen in the country's tough policy toward the Soviet Union. The Democratic and Republican parties seem to be constantly fighting, but their real purpose is nothing more than to prevent the formation of a third party. The rise of right-wing groups in the United States has a dangerous result, namely, as Premier Stalin said, those who are allied with Churchill will have increasing influence in American foreign policy. These dangerous warmongers will strongly shelve Roosevelt's policies and replace them with Vandenberg's atomic diplomacy. Fortunately, Molotov's speech at the United Nations General Assembly yesterday greatly encouraged progressive Americans. Friends of peace around the world hope that all progressive elements can unite and continue to promote Roosevelt's peace policy.</p>
<h3>Unprecedentedly Enthusiastic Voting</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 5th] The weather was clear everywhere in the United States today for the election, and people were enthusiastically voting, enough to break records. Voting started in the East, followed by the Midwest, and then the West.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 5th] In today's elections for the governors of 47 of the 48 states in the United States, and for members of Congress, the number of voters who went to the polls ranged from 35 million to 40 million. This year's Congressional elections will elect 432 members of the 80th Congress and 35 senators and 33 governors. Maine is the exception, having elected one senator, three members of Congress, and the state's governor in September. Across the United States, there will be lists of 854 candidates from major parties, and the Democratic Party will clearly lose to the Republican Party. According to neutral political analysts, the Republican Party will dominate and control the House of Representatives. Even in the Senate, the 17-seat difference with the Democratic Party may also be broken, obtaining a similar number of seats. If the Republican Party wins, it will have a major impact on Truman in the final year of the 80th Congress and in the 1948 presidential election. Although the Democratic Party's control of the federal administration has not ended, this will end the party's sixteen years of control of Congress and will effectively cut off the Democratic Party's domestic policies. Although the Democratic Party's foreign policies may still be sustained for a while as various parties express their differences, because the United States is the leader of world politics. Although this development is a domestic matter, it should also have repercussions globally. In short, a Republican victory will separate the administrative and legislative branches of American politics. This separation will make it difficult to cope with the international situation in times of crisis, and it will also be difficult to feel the need for legislative action in the face of domestic tensions. The results of today's election will also largely determine Truman's chances of success in the presidential election two years later, and will have an impact on the political future of the Republican nomination in 1948, especially New York Governor Dewey.</p>
<h3>Repercussions in Public Opinion of Various Countries</h3>
<p>[United Press, San Francisco, 5th] It is rare for the world to pay such great attention to this year's US elections. British newspapers discuss the separation of powers in American politics in complex terms, and the tone is full of criticism that this system is outdated. A Soviet journalist believes that the differences between the Democratic and Republican parties are not significant, and that American foreign policy is tantamount to taking a firm stance against the Soviet Union. German newspapers predict that regardless of the outcome of the election, American isolationism has come to an end. The Soviet Union is concerned about the growth of this firm American foreign policy toward the Soviet Union. British concern is sharpened by its reliance on foreign trade. Increasingly socialist England is exerting its highly organized strength to regain this trade. A French newspaper summarizes foreign opinions as follows: "The winning party will have the best chance to choose its party member to be the new president of the United States for future elections. The talent of the master of the White House in 1948 is indeed related to the fate of the United States, and even the fate of the world."</p>
<h3>Foreign Ministers' Conference Continues, Listening to Italy's Southern Statements, Southern Representatives Prepare to Propose New Plan, US-Soviet Dispute Over Trieste Port Very Fierce</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, New York, 6th] The four foreign ministers will hold an extremely important meeting today to listen to the statements of the Yugoslav representative on the Italo-Yugoslav issue. The Southern representative will propose a completely new draft for resolving the Italo-Southern disputes. Political observers believe that if Britain, the United States, and France believe that the Southern proposal is worthy of consideration, then the Soviet Foreign Minister may strongly urge it to be accepted. If so, the main friction between the Soviet Union and Britain and the United States may be eliminated.</p>
<p>[United Press, New York, 5th] Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov today apparently decided to make a last stand to bring the disputed port of Trieste into the Eastern European group. The foreign ministers of the four countries held their second meeting in New York today to discuss the five-nation peace treaty, and the Trieste port issue was still the most difficult.</p>
<p>[United Press, New York, 5th] US Secretary of State Byrnes insisted at the Foreign Ministers' Conference today that Yugoslavia could not enjoy the various rights of the Italian peace treaty unless it signed the treaty. Britain agreed, while France opposed. Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov accused Byrnes of nothing less than submitting an ultimatum to the Foreign Ministers' Conference, but Byrnes denied it. The two sides were unable to resolve the dispute and decided to postpone the discussion.</p>
<h3>US Proposal for Disarmament: Draft Amendment</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 5th] Regarding the issue of universal disarmament among nations, it is reported by well-informed sources that senior government officials and politicians in the United States are currently studying a plan based on the recent statement made by the head of the US delegation, Austin. This plan will be submitted to the Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly and the Security Council for discussion. Foreign Minister Molotov of the Soviet Union formally proposed to the United Nations General Assembly days ago, advocating for universal disarmament among nations. The plan that the United States intends to propose will be presented in the form of an amendment, advocating for supplementing the shortcomings of the Soviet proposal with a monitoring system. This plan is essentially the first step towards reconciling the plans of the US and the Soviet Union and achieving consistency.</p>

<h3>The Netherlands Sends Note to Four Allied Governments, Requests Adjustment of Dutch-German Border, Seeks Mining Rights to Compensate for Economic Losses</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 5th] The Dutch government tonight notified the governments of the United Kingdom, the United States, the Soviet Union, and France, requesting a revision of the Dutch-German border and compensation from Germany for economic losses. The notification indicated that the Dutch government is prepared to limit its land claims to only some border adjustments, and intends to make economic loss compensation the primary demand. The demands of the Dutch government are as follows: (1) Certain mineral resources on the left bank of the Rhine River in Germany will be granted to the Netherlands for mining rights, for a period of forty to fifty years. The Dutch government attaches great importance to obtaining this concession, as the need for coal can be balanced, and the implementation of industrial plans can be further assisted. (2) Transportation fees for German railways, highways, and waterways, as well as port and warehouse fees, should be regulated to prevent unfair competition with Dutch ports. (3) Germany is prohibited from excavating new canals to change the existing waterways of the Rhine River. (4) The Dutch government believes that Germany's monetary policy should be based on the principle of not harming its major interests. The notification continued, stating that the Dutch government is in principle opposed to expanding its territory by annexing the land of others. However, due to the repeated creation of difficulties by the original Dutch-German border in the past, it is forced to request some border adjustments. The Dutch government has considered the following points in this regard: (1) Shortening the border line, (2) Improving local transportation, (3) Partially improving canals and waterways. One of the results of the border adjustment is that the length of the Dutch-German border line can be reduced from 825 kilometers to 340 kilometers. The land that Germany will cede to the Netherlands as a result should not exceed 1,750 square kilometers. Among them, 119,000 German residents, except for prominent Nazis, will be allowed by the Dutch government to continue residing in the area if they resided there before mid-January 1940.</p>
<h3>If the German Question Reaches a Deadlock, A Four-Power Summit May Be Convened</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 6th] British government authorities stated today that if the Foreign Ministers' Conference fails to reach a basic agreement on the future of Germany, they will "actively consider" inviting Truman, Attlee, Bidault, and Stalin to hold a meeting. However, this four-power summit will only be considered if the Foreign Ministers of the four countries reach a deadlock on important issues.</p>
<h3>United Nations Headquarters: Either San Francisco or New York</h3>
<p>Belarusian Amendment Rejected</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 6th] The General Committee of the United Nations General Assembly convened today and passed the US proposal to use San Francisco or New York as the permanent headquarters of the United Nations. However, this decision is not final, as the General Assembly has not yet discussed it, and any representative has the right to propose an amendment. When the General Committee convened yesterday, the representative of Belarus proposed an amendment advocating for the relocation of United Nations institutions to Europe, which was rejected by a vote of seven to two, with three abstentions. The President of the General Assembly, Spaak, declared on the spot that moving the United Nations headquarters to another country would be a major political mistake.</p>
<h3>South Africa Requests Annexation of Southwest Africa: Indian Representative Firmly Opposes, Should Be Managed by the United Nations to Achieve Independence Soon</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 5th] The Trusteeship Committee of the United Nations General Assembly convened tonight to discuss the issue of the Union of South Africa's request to annex Southwest Africa. During the meeting, Sir Girja Shankar Bajpai, the representative of India, delivered a speech opposing South Africa's request, stating that South Africa's move violated the principles of the United Nations and was a retrograde action. During the transitional period before the complete autonomy of each mandate territory, it should be managed by United Nations institutions. The Trusteeship Council must be established promptly to promote the early independence of the trust territories. Regarding the trusteeship agreement drafted by the United Kingdom for its mandate territory of Tanganyika, it is a unilateral action. There are as many as 30,000 Overseas Indians in that area, and the United Kingdom did not consult with India in advance, which is unreasonable. The trusteeship agreement must stipulate a time limit. In the past, the actions of various mandate nations in handling the political education of residents in their mandate territories have often been slow. The African natives of the various mandate territories are not on an equal footing with European expatriates in politics and society, and the political rights of African natives are extremely limited, all of which should be improved. The representatives of France and the Netherlands then delivered speeches, stating their determination to adhere to the principles of the United Nations Charter.</p>
<h3>Condemnation of Actions to Eliminate Ethnic Groups: Resolution Included in General Assembly Agenda</h3>
<p>[Reuters, New York, Lake Success, 6th] The General Committee of the United Nations passed yesterday, by a vote of ten to two, the proposal submitted by India and Cuba regarding the case of the elimination of ethnic groups and religious practices, and included it in the agenda of the Plenary Session of the General Assembly.</p>
<h3>Viet Minh Republic: New Cabinet Established</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Saigon, 6th] Ho Chi Minh, President of the Viet Minh Republic, recently announced that the new cabinet has been formed. Ho Chi Minh concurrently holds the positions of Prime Minister and Foreign Minister. The cabinet includes fourteen ministers and nine deputy ministers.</p>
<h3>Land Dispute Between Vietnam and Siam Resolved</h3>
<p>Siam Returns 70,000 Square Miles to Vietnam</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 5th] Prince Souphanouvong, Advisor to the Kingdom of Laos, stated this morning before boarding a French plane to Paris with Prince Sisowath Youtevong of Cambodia, that Siam has abandoned its territorial claims to Vietnam and has agreed to return approximately 70,000 square miles of disputed territory to Vietnam, Cambodia, and the two kingdoms of Laos. Details of this agreement will be announced by French Ambassador Payart within two weeks. It is revealed that these negotiations concluded a few days ago, with the participation of representatives from both Siam and Vietnam, as well as French Ambassador Payart and US Assistant Secretary of State Acheson.</p>
<h3>Discovery in Alaska: Floating Corpse of Ancient Giant Beast</h3>
<p>[Anchor Point, Alaska, 5th] A corpse of a large animal floated onto the surface of Cook Inlet in Homer, Alaska today. It is believed to be a prehistoric creature. The front half of this mammal is very similar to a large leopard. The entire body is 18 feet and 10 inches long and covered with hair-like fur. Its jawbone is similar to a shark. The upper jaw has 20 teeth, and the lower jaw has 22 teeth, each tooth being 4 inches long and 1 inch thick.</p>
<h3>US Directive to the Japanese Government: Continued Rectification of Official Conduct</h3>
<p>This Proposal Was Made by the Soviet Representative</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 6th] The Japanese Cabinet held a special meeting this afternoon to discuss the major issues arising from the recent order issued by the US authorities to continue the rectification of official conduct. According to the US directive, more than 150 members of the House of Representatives will be dismissed, and local government agencies will also be thoroughly reorganized. This proposal was recently put forward by the Soviet representative at the Allied Council for Japan.</p>
<h3>Communist Party in Manila: Linked to the Hukbalahap Resistance Army - Announced by Philippine Interior Minister Zulueta -</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Manila, 5th] Regarding the connection between the Hukbalahap Resistance Army and the Chinese Communist Party here, there have been new discoveries recently. Philippine Interior Minister Zulueta announced that, according to the report he recently received from the Chief of Constabulary, there is sufficient evidence to show a connection between the Chinese guerrillas and the Hukbalahap Resistance Army. This is because it was discovered that Hukbalahap leader Taruc had extracted 10,000 pesos from the 100,000 pesos donated by the Chinese community in Luzon. In addition, the local Chinese Communist leader, said to be Huang Jie, the commander of the Chinese guerrillas, in addition to using 1,000 pesos to entertain Taruc, 100 pesos to give to Taruc's wife, and 10 pesos to buy flowers, also extracted 62,000 pesos from the Chinese community donations. Therefore, it is known that there must be a connection between the two armies.</p>
<h3>The Debauchery of Hitler</h3>
<p>At Least Five Women in His Bed Every Night</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Dusseldorf, Germany, 5th] Stories of Hitler's debauchery during his lifetime are becoming increasingly bizarre. Previously, there was a rumour that Hitler had an affair with the wife of his propaganda minister, Goebbels, and had an illegitimate child. Now, according to the recent confession of Hitler's confidant, Giesler, Hitler had at least five women in his bed every night. The German Gestapo searched for and continuously presented beautiful women to Hitler.</p>

<h3>Wanted: Chen Binhe and Wu Yue; The Public Prosecutor's Office Detailed the Crimes of the Two Traitors in the Indictment: Attacking the Central Government and Deceiving the People in the Occupied Areas; Both Advocated for the Enemy and Puppet Regimes and Hindered the War of Resistance</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The Public Prosecutor's Office has already sent letters to military and police agencies in recent days, requesting assistance in apprehending the two traitors Chen Binhe and Wu Yue to be brought to justice for interrogation.</p>
<p>[Another Report] Chen Binhe, Wu Yue, Jiang Zhixin, Li Hanshan, Lu Huishan, Shen Qiaosheng, Li Chungen, Chen Boming, etc., have recently been prosecuted by the Public Prosecutor's Office on suspicion of being traitors. Sheng Shiming, Lin Wenzhen, Wei Dezhang, etc., were not prosecuted due to insufficient evidence.</p>
<p>The indictments of Chen Binhe and Wu Yue are published below:</p>
<p>Defendant Chen Binhe, male, age and origin unknown, president of the puppet Shen Bao newspaper, at large. Wu Yue, male, age and origin unknown, editor-in-chief of the puppet Shen Bao newspaper, at large. The aforementioned defendants are involved in Case No. 195 of the Special Investigation for Traitorous Suspicions in the 35th year of the Republic of China. After investigation by this prosecutor, it is deemed necessary to initiate a public prosecution. The facts of the crime, evidence, and applicable legal provisions are listed below:</p>
<p>Before the Pacific War, defendant Chen Binhe colluded with Japanese strategist Major Kazuo Wachi in Hong Kong, engaging in intelligence work for the enemy. After the fall of Hong Kong, he was introduced to Shanghai by Major Wachi and was connected with Su Sen, a Taiwanese councilor of the enemy's Katayama Agency under the leadership of Agency Chief Katayama, tasked with gathering intelligence on our central government. He sent the intelligence to the agency's office at No. 517 Hualian Hotel in this city every day. Because Chen had rendered meritorious service to the enemy, on December 8, 1942, he relied on the enemy's power to coerce and seize the Shen Bao newspaper, becoming its president and receiving a monthly subsidy of 500,000 military yen from the enemy's Army Department. Subsequently, Chen initiated the organization of the Shanghai Press Association, serving as its chairman and also as a consultant to the Shanghai Municipal Government. The opinions expressed in the puppet Shen Bao, which he operated, aimed to support the enemy and puppet regimes' Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, serving as a tool for the enemy and puppet regimes, assisting evildoers, and specializing in propaganda for the enemy and puppet regimes, attacking the central government, and deceiving the people in the occupied areas. Defendant Wu Yue served as the editor-in-chief of the puppet Shen Bao newspaper from May 1, 1945, also using his writing to produce propaganda that was beneficial to the enemy and puppet regimes. After the enemy country surrendered, he and Chen Binhe fled without a trace on August 11, 1945. This is specifically reported in accordance with the law.</p>
<p>The fact that the defendants served in the aforementioned puppet positions and committed the crimes has been verified and confirmed. There are proofs from the Shanghai Special Commissioner's Office of the Investigation and Statistics Bureau of the Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Nationalist Party, as well as the Shanghai Municipal Government Investigation Department, the Songhu Garrison Headquarters, and the Shen Bao newspaper's replies. Also included are the article "Chen Binhe's Reply to Readers" published in the puppet Shen Bao on June 29 and 30, 1944, submitted by the Central Statistics Bureau of the Shen Bao newspaper, and the article "Chen Binhe's Discussion on China's New Unification" published in the Wen You magazine. His false and heretical arguments are too numerous to mention. In particular, the article that lightly criticized Chairman Chiang Kai-shek of our National Government to curry favor with the enemy was serially published in the puppet New Shen Bao and puppet New China Daily for more than ten days. It was absurd and unprecedented, truly heinous and extremely sinful. Defendant Wu Yue, as the editor-in-chief of the puppet Shen Bao newspaper, colluded with Chen Binhe in writing editorials, both advocating for the enemy and puppet regimes and hindering the War of Resistance. According to Article 2, Section 7 of the Regulations for Handling Traitor Cases, those who serve as presidents and editors-in-chief of newspapers within the jurisdiction of the puppet organization and produce propaganda for the enemy and puppet regimes should be subject to strict reporting. The defendants incited the people to flee and defect to the enemy, and transmitted and investigated news related to military, political, and economic matters, all of which are included in treasonous acts. It should be recognized that they have committed the crime of conspiring with enemy countries to resist this country under Article 2, Paragraph 1, Section 1 of the Regulations for Punishing Traitors. A public prosecution is initiated in accordance with Article 1, Sections 1 and 2 of the Special Criminal Cases Procedure Regulations and Article 230, Sections 1 and 2 of the Criminal Procedure Law. Jiang Gongliang, Prosecutor of the Shanghai High Court.</p>
<h3>Original Judgment of Yuan Ludeng Revoked, Retrial to be Held on the 14th</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Yuan Ludeng, one of the "Three Elders of Shanghai," was sentenced to life imprisonment by the Shanghai High Court for the crime of treason. The Supreme Court has now ruled to revoke the original judgment and remand the case for a new trial. The High Court has scheduled Judge Qiu HuanYing to hold a hearing on the morning of the 14th of this month at 9:30 AM to question him.</p>
<h3>Zhang Diesheng and Gu Zhuming: Trial Temporarily Suspended</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Zhang Diesheng, former general manager of the Guangzhong Dyeing and Weaving Factory, was reported after the victory by Yu Yunfeng, the former deputy manager of the factory, who alleged that Zhang had collaborated with Gu Zhuming to weave yellow military uniform cloth and white sanitary cloth for the enemy. The Public Prosecutor's Office filed a public prosecution in this case, but both Zhang and Gu have unknown addresses and could not be summoned. Therefore, the two defendants did not appear in court during the first investigative hearing held by the High Court. The case was heard again yesterday afternoon, and both defendants still did not appear. The defense lawyer hired by the defendant's family, Zhi Li, stated that Gu Zhuming is currently in Xi'an and will arrive in court soon. The presiding judge informed them that an arrest warrant had been issued for the defendant in Xi'an, but he had not yet been arrested. Before the arrest is made, the trial of this case will be temporarily suspended. After the statement, the court adjourned.</p>
<p>Zhu Yicai: Aiding the Enemy with Steel</p>
<p>Zhu Yicai, chairman of the Yangzhou Zhenyang Electrical Company, is accused of collaborating with the enemy after the fall of Yangzhou, reusing Japanese nationals Saburo and several ronin. He sold more than 200 dan of steel to the enemy's Xinye Company to aid the enemy. In addition, he served as a supervisor of the enemy's Central China Aviation Co., Ltd. The case was investigated in court yesterday afternoon. The defendant stated that he is 64 years old and from Wuxi. After the fall of Yangzhou, the Japanese did not take over the Zhenyang Company. It was still run by Chinese people, just like before the war. No Japanese ronin were reused in the company. Saburo was a section chief and was only responsible for purchasing coal from the Japanese in Nanjing. He did not advise on other administrative matters. The sale of scrap iron was handled by manager Zhu Hanfu, and the Xinye Iron Factory was not opened by the Japanese. The defendant never served as a supervisor of the enemy's Central China Aviation Co., Ltd. After the interrogation, the defendant was returned to custody.</p>
<p>Two Traitors: Aiding and Abetting the Enemy</p>
<p>In addition, Russian man Baodexi served as a secret agent for the enemy's Harbin Gendarmerie after the fall of the Northeast on September 18. After the outbreak of the Pacific War, he worked in the Criminal Section of the enemy's Gendarmerie at the Broadway Mansion in Shanghai, specializing in interrogating arrested foreign nationals. He often demanded money from various gambling dens by relying on the enemy's power. In addition, Zhu Linsheng, the puppet Bao chief of the 20th Bao in the Second District of Shanghai, was a disciple of Lu Ying. He conscripted laborers to help the enemy build factories. Both of the above cases were investigated in court yesterday and were postponed for further interrogation. Zhu Wenbin, son of Zhu Linsheng, who served as the squad leader of Wu Shibao's special agent team and the chief of staff of Zhang Beisheng's puppet army, has fled to avoid punishment.</p>

<h3>Communist Area Instructor Robbing Homes</h3>
<p>Enemies Meeting on a Narrow Road, Victim Coincidentally Encountered</p>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Jiang Laihe, the former instructor of the New Fourth Army District in Northern Jiangsu, was stationed in Wujian Township, Taizhou on March 16 this year. He led more than 600 Communist soldiers to surround the nearby towns and villages, looting all the grain owned by rural farmers such as Ju Rubi, and slaughtering all pigs, sheep, and livestock. He also forced Ju to hand over 80 shi of grain, with a ten-day deadline. Before leaving, he also moved away all the boxes, cages, and furniture. At that time, Ju was unable to comply with the order and had to dismantle and sell the house. Under these circumstances, Ju felt that it was not easy to make a living and fled to Shanghai. Through a friend's introduction, he worked as a laborer in a factory on Tokyo Road and Macau Road. Unexpectedly, when he was returning home from work (living in Hengfeng Road, Zhabei) yesterday afternoon, it was a case of enemies meeting on a narrow road.

<h3>Autumn Property Tax and Construction Surcharge Collection to Begin Today</h3>
<p>Printed Payment Slips Distributed to Residents</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] The Municipal Finance Bureau, to facilitate the collection of property tax and municipal construction surcharge, previously sent out a declaration form to each household to investigate the actual monthly rent from July to December of this year for calculation purposes. It is reported that the bureau will begin collecting the autumn property tax and municipal construction surcharge for the 35th year of the Republic, starting today. Payment slips in triplicate, printed in red, white, and blue, will be delivered to each household by special messengers. Upon receipt, residents should sign or stamp the delivery book of the bureau. The red slip serves as a notice, to be retained by the acting municipal treasury bank; the white slip is a receipt, to be stamped with the bank's receiving seal and date, and returned to the payer; the blue slip is a report, to be stamped with the bank's received seal and date, and sent to the Property Tax Section of the Finance Bureau for accounting and filing. The payment slip specifies the resident's name (if blank, the resident should fill it in on all slips), the landlord's name, the property address, and the property's classification. The bureau has separately designated three classes: A, B, and C, estimating the rental value in the 26th year of the Republic and the actual rent. The resident should pay the full amount of the autumn property tax for the 35th year (borne by the landlord) and the municipal construction surcharge (borne by the resident), and then deduct the property tax from the rent.</p>
<p>Upon receiving the payment slip, residents should, within the specified period of fourteen days, submit the payment or a check along with all three slips to any payment location listed on the receipt. If paying by check, it must be a crossed check payable to "Shanghai Municipal Finance Bureau," and mailed by registered post, together with the three payment slips, to the Tax Collection Office of the Central District at 180 Fuzhou Road. A receipt will be issued within ten days and delivered to the resident. If the check is not drawn by the payer, the payer must endorse it.</p>
<p>Households that fail to pay within the deadline will be subject to a late payment penalty. For delays of less than one month, a penalty of one-tenth of the tax due will be added. For delays of less than two months, three-tenths will be added. For delays exceeding two months, five-tenths will be added, and legal action may be taken to recover the debt. Payment locations include: (1) 180 Fuzhou Road, (2) 80 Madang Road, (3) 28 Fulu Li Road, (4) 1 Lafayette Road, (5) 94 Jessfield Road, (6) 1762 Haig Road, (7) 1461 Xin Zha Road, (8) 788 Seymour Road, (9) 456 Avenue Road, (10) 130 Haining Road, (11) 265 Changyang Road, (12) 558 Jiangpu Road, (13) 50 Jiujiang Road.</p>
<h3>Pornographic Song and Dance Films a Thing of the Past: Hollywood Changes Style; Dialect Dialogue Unpopular; Small Films Expected to Penetrate Rural Areas</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] Those who appreciate the art of film will likely not overlook the recent announcement by the agent of MGM, Mr. Luo, regarding the company's two new filmmaking plans: one is to add audio tracks with narration in the language of the screening location to existing films, and the other is to produce small, 16mm films.</p>
<p>The "Tarzan Goes to New York," which was recently screened at the Grand China Theater, was an experiment with the former plan. Readers may recall that the theater advertised the film with Mandarin dialogue as a selling point. However, the audience was greatly disappointed, as the entire film was not dubbed in Mandarin. Instead, a third-person narrator described portions of the dialogue. This failed to synchronize with the actors' lip movements, resembling the old silent films. The audience did not welcome this. After this attempt, MGM's Shanghai office reported the failure to its American headquarters, deeming this approach unsuitable for Shanghai. This is because Shanghai audiences generally possess a reasonable level of English proficiency, and the essence of artistic films lies in the dialogue. If simplified narration in Mandarin is used, the original meaning will inevitably be lost and the experience will be uninteresting. However, it is said that the headquarters is still considering this, as they believe that this type of reform can attract audiences who do not understand English, thereby promoting sales.</p>
<p>The other plan, involving 16mm films, aims to develop markets in small cities and rural areas. These small films are extremely easy to transport, and the screening venues do not need to be elaborate. It is reported that some small cities in southern China have already signed contracts with MGM. It is expected that British films will soon penetrate rural areas.</p>
<p>According to film industry insiders, Hollywood's filmmaking style has been changing since the end of the war. During the war, due to the need for entertainment in the military and the relative shortage of personnel and materials, a large number of crudely produced pornographic song and dance films and sensational slapstick films were released. Now, there is a gradual shift towards the production of artistic films, with a focus on quality rather than quantity. Examples include "Casablanca," "The More the Merrier," and "The Bells of St. Mary's," all of which were produced in 1945 and recently screened in this city. The old films produced during the war and accumulated in this city have been gradually cleared out after more than a year of screenings. At the same time, the US government has imposed quotas on film exports, so most of the films shipped to China will be new films. Starting next year, the films screened in this city are expected to be completely new.</p>
<h3>Goods Swindled with Bounced Checks, Stolen Goods Recovered, Perpetrator at Large</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] Wang Guangqin operated Hengtong Shenzhuang inside Tongchenghang at 42 Wufu Lane. One day at around 3:30 PM, Cao Xinxian, the owner of Daxin Alkali Factory at 47 Wujia Lane outside the Dadongmen in the Nanshi district, purchased 600 bags of American alkali powder at 26,500 yuan per bag, totaling 15,900,000 yuan. At that time, four trucks from the Dalu Transport Company at 14 Xinyong'an Street successively went to the warehouse of the China Industrial Bank on North Suzhou Road to pick up the goods and drive away. Cao Xinxian, lacking cash, only provided two checks dated November 4th from Yisheng Shenzhuang at 10 Waitan, totaling 9,000,000 yuan and 1,450,000 yuan, and one check dated November 3rd from Guohua Bank, drawn by Xietai, with a face value of 5,450,000 yuan. To his dismay, all of the checks were returned unpaid when they matured. After Wang searched for Cao Xinxian without success, he realized he had been intentionally defrauded and reported the matter to the Laozha Police Precinct. The Criminal Division ordered officers Feng Xiushan, Liu Zongtong, Song Jiabao, and others to investigate based on leads from the Dalu Transport Company, and discovered that Cao had transported the goods to Xinyu Warehouse at 81 Yanghang Street. They raided the location and recovered 300 bags of alkali powder stored under the name of Jiutaihe and 41 bags stored under the name of Daxin. Another 246 bags were found at Baolai Warehouse at 5 Huangdai Street, stored under the name of Taiji. Thirteen bags are still missing and the investigation is ongoing. Cao Xinxian has not yet been apprehended.</p>

The Secretariat was requested to inform the Municipal Government and order the Committee to dissolve immediately.

<h3>Li Jinglu Inspects Shanghai Yesterday, Instructs on Shipping and Transportation Issues, Strictly Prohibiting Black Market Ticket Price Adjustments</h3>
<p>Li Jinglu, Director of the Navigation Administration Department of the Ministry of Transportation, came to Shanghai yesterday to inspect navigation administration. He instructed various leaders of the shipping industry on issues such as adjusting shipping routes, promoting shipping construction, organizing a disaster relief transport office, and taking over the Water Transport Brigade of the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration. Regarding the adjustment of passenger ticket prices on various shipping routes, he stated that the originally set prices were indeed too low. Since March 1st of this year, eight months have passed without adjustment, while the price index has soared and shipping costs have increased several times compared to March. For example, the price of coal allocated by the Fuel Management Committee has risen from 24,000 yuan per ton to 100,000 to 120,000 yuan, and the price of diesel has risen from 34,000 yuan per ton to 168,000 yuan. The prices of other hardware, ship crew salaries, dock fees, and passenger meals have all increased three to ten times. Previously, the Ministry of Transportation received a request from the Shipping Industry Association to adjust ticket prices and, after careful consideration, taking into account both shipping costs and passenger burdens, decided to increase the prices on the Beiyang route by two times the original price, and short routes such as Shanghai-Yangzhou by one time the original price. Other routes will be reviewed after detailed investigation. Starting this month, all public utilities have raised prices due to cost factors. There are fewer regular passenger liners in China, and in the past, due to excessively low ticket prices, shipping companies were unwilling to purchase passenger ships to avoid losses, which hindered the maintenance and development of water transportation. To promote the increase of regular liners, the government has approved a reasonable adjustment of ticket prices. However, the sale of black market tickets, whether by scalpers or shipping companies, is strictly prohibited and will be severely punished according to the law upon discovery.</p>
<p>China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Freight Rates to Be Verified in Nanjing</p>
<p>Mr. Li Jinglu also attended a meeting of the board of directors of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company yesterday. The company specifically prepared a detailed report on the proposed adjustment standards for passenger and freight rates on the Beiyang route and the process of private shipping companies requesting price increases. Director Li presented the report to the ministry for verification. Mr. Li returned to Nanjing by overnight train last night, and the issue of shipping ticket prices is expected to be resolved in the short term.</p>
<p>Shanghai-Nantong Vessels Have Not Raised Prices</p>
<p>Regarding the news reported yesterday that private cargo freight rates on the Shanghai-Nantong route had been raised, Li Yunliang, Secretary-General of the Shanghai Shipping Industry Association, solemnly stated to reporters that this was completely inaccurate. It is claimed that the current freight rate from Shanghai to Nantong is only 12,200 yuan per ton, which is the price set on March 1st of this year. It is even lower than the barge fee for crossing the Huangpu River, which is extremely low. It has not been increased at all in the past nine months. However, costs such as stacking and labor have increased many times, which are generally paid by the shipping companies. The cost of navigation has also increased sharply. The shipping companies operating on this route have tried their best to support it, and there has been no private increase in freight rates.</p>
<h3>Slap in the Face as Payment for Fare, Gun Pulled and Pedestrian Injured</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] At 11:30 PM last night, four or five people arrived in three pedicabs at the entrance of the Zhengfeng Hotel on Guangdong Road. A dispute over the fare arose, and the hotel manager came out to mediate, resolving the issue. Subsequently, a companion hired a rickshaw, and a dispute over the fare arose again. The passenger not only slapped the rickshaw puller but also drew a gun from his waist and fired a shot. The rickshaw puller escaped unharmed, but a stray bullet struck a pedestrian, Gu Zhongqi, in the back, piercing through his chest, and he collapsed to the ground. After the incident, his companions scattered. The perpetrator was apprehended by nearby street police and taken to the Laozha Precinct for questioning. He identified himself as Zhou Fuyun, 29 years old, from Henan Province, and claimed to be a member of the tax police investigation team. The team leader, Xu Yapeng, had recently opened a room at the Central Hotel, room 325, two days ago, and the four or five companions were there to discuss official business. He claimed that the shooting was accidental. The injured man was sent to Renji Hospital for treatment, and his life is said to be in danger.</p>

<h3>Motorcycle Overturns, Owner of Western Medicine Store Loses Leg</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] Zhang Zhiqing, 40 years old, the owner of Shunfeng Western Medicine Store at 19 Guangxi Road, was riding a motorcycle No. 105 at around 5:00 PM yesterday afternoon. When passing the Bund on Hankou Road, a jeep card, test vehicle No. 160 from the Executive Yuan, was speeding towards him. Unable to avoid it, the two vehicles collided.

<h3>For the Sake of an Actress, Vendors Gathered and Engaged in Armed Brawl</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] At 10:00 PM last night, a brawl broke out between two groups of vendors at the intersection of Yunnan South Road and Zhongzheng Road. Each side gathered twenty or thirty thugs, and iron rulers and knives flew indiscriminately for twenty minutes. As a result, two vendors from the Yunnan South Road group were injured and collapsed. Seeing that their goal had been achieved, the fruit vendors from the 16th Pu group fled in all directions. After the incident, the injured were taken to Nanyang Hospital by car. The Taishan Road Police Station received the news during the brawl and dispatched a red patrol car. However, when they arrived at the scene, both sides had dispersed. The identity of the perpetrators is still under investigation. One of the injured, Yuan Derong, 21 years old, from Ningbo, sustained three knife wounds to his buttocks and one knife wound to his penis. The other injured, Ren Zhimin, 20 years old, from Ningbo, was injured by an iron ruler. The reason for the brawl was that the previous night at 11:00 PM, Wu Amao (16 years old), an actress who performs Yue Opera at the Great World Amusement Park, was harassed by vendors in Yunnan South Road. Vendors from the 16th Pu group saw the injustice and intervened, leading to a quarrel and an agreement to meet last night to settle the score.</p>
<h3>Young Man Deceives with Lead Buckets in Front of Shanghai Bank</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] Yu Kunhua, 33 years old, from Shaoxing, makes a living selling boat buckets and lives at 133 Haining Road. At around 2:00 PM yesterday afternoon, while carrying lead buckets in front of the Minfu Bank on Tianjin Road, a well-dressed young man in his twenties suddenly approached him and inquired about the price of the lead buckets. He replied that each bucket cost 7,000 yuan, totaling 77,000 yuan for eleven buckets. The young man, without hesitation, took all the lead buckets and said, "Come with me to get the money." Yu followed him. When they reached the entrance of the Shanghai Bank, the young man told Yu to wait outside. Yu, unsuspecting, saw the young man carrying the lead buckets into the bank. He did not see him come out for a long time. It was not until around 5:00 PM that he realized he had been deceived and reported the incident to the Huangpu Precinct for investigation.</p>
<h3>Bank Association Suggests Using Remittance Checks Instead of Drafts, and Bank Checks Instead of Promissory Notes</h3>
<p>The use of balance lines on promissory notes and drafts is not applicable, as stipulated by law, and recently, the Ministry of Finance has also issued clear instructions. However, the holder of the note seems to have little protection, especially for drafts circulating in distant places, which must be complete and secure. The banking community felt the importance of this issue, and the Bank Association commissioned the Banking Association to conduct a detailed study. The Banking Association now suggests using remittance checks instead of drafts and opening bank checks instead of promissory notes. An abstract of the draft method is as follows:</p>
<p>Name: (1) "Remittance Check" is the internal name, while the external name remains "Check." (2) "Bank Check" has the same name internally and externally.</p>
<p>Style: The style of "Remittance Check" and "Bank Check" should be similar to ordinary checks, but the color should be different from other checks of the bank (format omitted).</p>
<p>Applicable Accounting Subjects: (1) The accounting subjects applicable to "Remittance Check" follow the practice of drafts. (2) The "Bank Check" follows the "Promissory Note" subject, but the subject is divided into three sub-items for processing: "Sight Promissory Note," "Term Promissory Note," and "Bank Check."</p>
<p>Loss Reporting and Payment Suspension Methods: The loss reporting and payment suspension methods for "Remittance Check" and "Bank Check" are handled in the same way as for drafts and promissory notes.</p>

<h3>Future of Greater Shanghai: A Beautiful Dream, A World-Class City with a Population of 15 Million, Urban Planning Committee to Discuss Century-Long Plan Today</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Urban Planning Committee will convene a general meeting of its members at 3:00 PM this afternoon. The Public Utilities Bureau, the Public Works Bureau, the Engineering Planning Group of the Executive Yuan, the Finance Bureau, the Health Bureau, the Social Bureau, and national engineering experts, responsible for designing and building the urban plan of Greater Shanghai, will participate to discuss and determine the overall plan for Greater Shanghai. According to sources at the East China News Agency, the overall plan for the construction of Greater Shanghai can be divided into three parts: (1) Natural Construction, (2) Economic Construction, (3) Social Construction. Since this plan concerns a century-long undertaking, its overall plan must be carefully reviewed before being drafted. To accurately understand the current situation in Shanghai, five investigation principles have been formulated: (1) Investigation of the Greater Shanghai Area, (2) Investigation of the City's Population Residence, (3) Investigation of Industry and Commerce, (4) Transportation Investigation, (5) Public Utilities Investigation. The above five investigations include statistical capacity observation of the city, the current housing situation, and the use of the city's rivers. Currently, the city can only accommodate a population of 5 million people. The planned area will be expanded to a world-class metropolis capable of accommodating 15 million people. In this plan, the Shanghai area extends east to Pudong, south to Nanhui, west to Longhua, and north to Jiangwan Dachan. Currently, traffic congestion and transportation difficulties are caused by the concentration of people in the city center. In this plan, Pudong will be designated as a residential area, the city center as a commercial area, and the outer suburbs as industrial areas. As for the three constructions, the natural construction mainly belongs to material and geographical construction, such as fixed material constructions such as roads, docks, houses, parks, public transportation, etc., and attention will be paid to the development of the port, the connection of railway airports and highway main lines, so as to become the hub of various land, sea and air transportation. Then, it will be coordinated with the distribution of various industries and commerce, and the setting of residential areas, schools, parks and public constructions, as well as cultural and other social constructions. As for economic construction and social construction, they will be determined on the physical basis, and must take into account the economic and social development, and be practically matched with the current actual needs. The detailed plan will be discussed further today.</p>
<h3>Committee for Frugality Movement: Promoting Electricity Conservation, Encouraging Everyone to Sleep Early and Rise Early, Mayor Wu Suggests Seven Points</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Committee for Frugality Movement held a standing committee meeting yesterday at 5 PM in the Municipal Government Conference Room. Attending were Mayor Wu Guozhen, Speaker Pan Gongzhan (acting), Director of the Social Affairs Bureau Wu Kaixian (acting), Director of the Public Utilities Bureau Zhao Zengjue, Party Secretary of the Municipal Headquarters Lei Jizhang Xie Renzhao, Peng Zhenqiu from the Education Bureau, Zhu Yunda from the Health Bureau, Cao Jun from the Shanghai Branch of the Youth League, Jiang Baolian from the Lishi Society, Xu Jiqing from the Chamber of Commerce, Xi Yushu from the Guild of Accountants, Feng Youzhen (acting) from the Journalists Association, Qian Jianqiu from the Women's Association, Tang Shichang from the Local Associations, Bu Ruhan from the Municipal Sports Association, and Lu Gancong from the YMCA, among over ten others. Mayor Wu presided over the meeting. After the formalities, Mayor Wu stated the significance of the meeting, hoping to use the power of the people to promote electricity conservation. He hoped that the Municipal Committee for Frugality Movement would assist the government in launching this campaign. Following this, Director Zhao of the Public Utilities Bureau elaborated on the current situation of electricity conservation and future conservation methods, stating: Although the electricity restriction measures have been implemented, some waste is still unavoidable, especially in shops and public places. However, it is difficult to enforce conservation. It is only appropriate to use publicity and public opinion to make citizens aware of the importance of electricity conservation for national revival and reconstruction, and to conserve electricity voluntarily. Five methods for voluntary conservation are:</p>
<p>(1) Promote the use of fluorescent lights in places where lights are on for extended periods. (Fluorescent lights are easily damaged if switched on and off too frequently, so they are suitable for places where they are used for long periods.) (2) Promote turning off or reducing the number of lights when there is no need for lighting. (3) Promote early rising and early sleeping to conserve electricity. (4) Organize inspection teams to provide guidance and advice to public places, factories, and shops. (5) Reduce door lights and increase streetlights. Mayor Wu then made more concrete suggestions, stating: The most important time for electricity conservation is from 5 PM to 9 PM every day. There are three effective and practical improvement measures on the proactive side: (1) Retrofit fluorescent lights, which should be implemented especially in major stores. (2) Reduce the number of light fixtures, with standards of reducing 100 lights to 75 lights, and 40 lights to 25 lights. (3) Reduce the number of light bulbs, with standards of removing three out of ten, and one out of three. There are four measures on the passive side: (1) The committee should send letters to the Chamber of Commerce instructing all stores to implement electricity conservation, and the names of violators will be published in newspapers. (2) The committee should send letters to the general affairs and personnel departments of all government agencies to be responsible for implementing electricity conservation, and the names of violating agencies will be published in newspapers. (3) The committee should send letters to the district offices, requesting that they instruct the Baojia system to inform each household. (4) The committee should send letters to the Youth League to organize electricity conservation persuasion teams to go to various stores and residential areas starting from the 11th of this month to advise on conservation. All committee members present agreed, and the meeting adjourned at 6 PM.</p>
<h3>Opinions of Electricity Experts: Limiting Residential Lighting Does Not Help Increase Production; The Real Time of Electricity Shortage in This City is During the Day; The Fundamental Problem is Still Not Enough Machines</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Regarding electricity restrictions, the Shanghai Electric Power Company will issue the first batch of notices within this month, including users with both electric heating and lighting meters, and commercial electricity users. The restriction amount for ordinary household lighting users will be notified later. The main cause of the electricity shortage in this city is the machine problem, and the most serious time of the daily electricity shortage is in the morning, lacking 17,000 kilowatts, and in the afternoon, lacking 10,000 kilowatts. There is no panic about electricity at night. Therefore, electricity experts in this city believe that limiting the amount of electricity used by residential lighting to increase industrial production is inconsistent with the actual situation in this city. Because no one uses electric lights during the day, and electricity is not lacking at night. The time of highest daily electricity consumption in this city is from 6 PM to 7 PM, so the power company hopes that the public will conserve electricity during that time.</p>

<h3>Land Registration Deadline is the 10th of This Month</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The Land Administration Bureau has been handling land registration in the six districts of Huangpu, etc. in this city, which has been very smooth. The absolute majority of land owners residing in this city have already registered. Many people residing in other cities have also submitted official documents to the bureau stating the reasons. However, because the registration procedures for public land, foreign land, and enemy-puppet land have not been completed, the bureau has not yet been able to compile land statistics for this city. After the extension period for land registration ends on the 10th of this month, the bureau will compile a list of ownerless land. In addition, the bureau will issue a notice within a few days, declaring that all past old property certificates are invalid.

<h3>Stealing "Tip" When Picking Up Goods; Customs Inspector Prosecuted</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Yu Chongxing of the Hengxingrui Cloth Store in this city went to the Nanmu Warehouse of the Jianghai Customs in September of this year to pick up cotton cloth. He temporarily found that two pieces of cotton cloth were missing. According to regulations, he could not pick up the goods when the actual quantity of goods did not match the quantity stated on the warehouse receipt. However, because Yu Chongxing was eager to pick up the goods, he asked Xie Yaoming, a customs inspector of the Jianghai Customs, to sign and certify the missing goods for future negotiation, and allow him to pick up the remaining cotton cloth first. Yu Chongxing then indicated that he would steal a "tip," and gave Xie Yaoming 1.5 million yuan in cash at the San Warehouse of the warehouse as a tip. Xie was caught by a high-ranking official of the Jianghai Customs while receiving the money, and Xie was detained and sent to the District Prosecutor's Office for handling. After investigation by the prosecutor, it was deemed that the crime was indeed committed, and a public prosecution was filed yesterday for fraud and embezzlement.</p>

<h3>Buying and Hiding Guns; Confiscated and Sentenced According to Law</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] At around 9 PM on August 10th of this year, a U.S. military soldier suddenly came to the Xiexing Embroidery Shop at No. 166, Section 14, Henan Road, and peddled a pistol. At that time, only Shen Huanrong, a 19-year-old apprentice in the store, was present and was very afraid when he saw it. He then took out 40,000 yuan in legal tender, and the U.S. military left the gun and took the money. After Shen Huanrong got the gun, he hid it in Zhang Han's (female) room. The next day, it was discovered by the Huangqing Sub-bureau, and the gun was found. The case was sent to the District Prosecutor's Office. Shen Huanrong, Zhang Han, and the store owner Zhou Juting were prosecuted by the prosecutor for endangering public safety and knowingly buying stolen goods. The district court opened the trial yesterday, and all three defendants appeared in court. Shen Huanrong denied intending to buy it, saying that he was afraid and gave 40,000 yuan with the intention of getting the U.S. military to leave. Zhang Han confessed that she was asleep when Shen came to deposit the gun, so she did not know what it was. Zhou Juting said that he stayed at home in the evening and did not know anything at all. The court considered that it was the first offense and gave a lenient sentence. Shen Huanrong and Zhang Han were each sentenced to four months of imprisonment. If they were to pay a fine in lieu of imprisonment, it would be calculated at 500 yuan per day. Zhou Juting was found not guilty.</p>

<p>Houjiatan Engineering Facilities: A Large Bridge to be Built on the Huangpu River; Design Not Yet Completed</p>
<p>Eagerly Hoping for UNRRA to Provide More Materials; $500 Million Loan Principally Agreed Upon</p>
<p>This reporter interviewed Hou Jiayuan, the head of the Engineering Planning Team of the Executive Yuan, yesterday, and asked about various issues such as the transportation materials transported to China by UNRRA, the $500 million loan, and the construction of the Huangpu River Bridge. According to him: UNRRA has transported 32 train engines, more than 400,000 sleepers, and various other materials to help the development of China's transportation industry. However, the country's railway transportation is riddled with holes, and there is a special need for equipment. It is eagerly hoped that UNRRA can provide more active and large-scale assistance. Although Hunan, Guangxi, Guizhou, Jiangxi and other provinces in our country also produce sleepers, it is estimated that the annual output next year can reach more than one million, but it still cannot meet the needs of the national railway. Regarding the US loan of 500 million yuan, according to Hou, the principle has been agreed upon by both China and the United States, and it can become a reality once the domestic political situation is stable. In order to provide reference data, the Engineering Planning Team specially dispatched personnel to inspect the transportation business in various parts of the country. The investigation has now been completed, and the details of this investigation will be rushed to print reports and a list of schedules, which will be submitted to the government as a reference for loans. In the future, the team's work plan will still focus on investigation, design engineering and promotion and implementation, so that the national railways, highways, and transportation projects can be gradually completed in accordance with the established plans. Regarding the construction of the Huangpu River Bridge, the Engineering Planning Team has decided in principle to build an active bridge in the upper reaches of the Huangpu River, and an underground tunnel in the lower reaches of the Huangpu River, which is the commercial district of this city. The design and budget of the project are the responsibility of the China Bridge Company. As soon as the design is completed and the funds are approved, construction can begin. However, the completion period is expected to be two to three years later.</p>

<h3>Answering Readers' Legal Questions</h3>
<p>(1) Yearning for Old Love</p>
<p>Asked by Zhang Sufang</p>
<p>A friend of mine, Ms. So-and-so, got engaged to Mr. So-and-so in the 29th year of the Republic. Mr. So-and-so used to have a mistress. Although Mr. So-and-so published a notice to sever the cohabitation relationship before the engagement, they still cohabitated after the engagement. My friend believes that marriage is related to lifelong happiness, so she intends to propose to dissolve the engagement. I have a few questions to ask for answers. (1) Is it legally permissible to sever the relationship after publishing a notice and then cohabitate again? (2) Is it reasonable to file for dissolution of the engagement? Is it legally permissible? (3) Does the woman have any compensation liability to the man? (Engagement expenses and assistance)? (4) Does the man have any liability to compensate the woman for prior losses?</p>
<p>[Answered by Lawyer Chuan Kuanglin] (1) There is no clear provision in the law, but if the woman who has been engaged to him marries the man, and the man engages in this behavior, it is a crime. (2) If one of the parties to the engagement commits adultery after the engagement is concluded, the other party may dissolve the engagement. This is clearly stipulated in Article 976, Paragraph 1, Subparagraph 7 of the Civil Code. (3) If the woman is not at fault, she has no liability for compensation. (4) If the woman is not at fault, she can request compensation from the man for damages. This damage is not limited to property damage.</p>
<p>(2) Spilled Water Cannot Be Recovered</p>
<p>Asked by Shi Jianwu: I married Ms. Huang in the spring of the 26th year of the Republic through a matchmaker. At the beginning of the marriage, the relationship was quite harmonious, and we had a daughter. However, due to the war and unemployment, I was trapped in my hometown. Ms. Huang could not endure poverty. When the whole family returned home from refuge in the autumn of the following year, she made excuses to return home, abandoned our infant daughter who was not yet one year old, and left and never returned. Now, after more than four years, I have remarried Ms. Zhu and have a son. Ms. Huang suddenly returned. At that time, my mother was still alive, and she was turned away by my mother. Then, after my persuasion, she left. Her whereabouts are unknown. If she comes back one day, (1) can I directly deny that she is my wife? (2) There is a clear provision in the law that husband and wife should fulfill the obligation of cohabitation. Since she is unwilling to fulfill the obligation of cohabitation and has been absent for more than five years, can it be considered a voluntary abandonment of the rights of husband and wife? Can I be held liable under the law? Is my bigamy crime established? (3) Is it necessary to publish a statement in the newspaper now? Because I have never gone through any procedures, and I have not published a statement in the newspaper either.</p>
<p>[Answered by Lawyer Fu Kuanglin] (1) She left her husband and did not return for several years, which has constituted grounds for divorce. Moreover, the love and righteousness between husband and wife has been severed by her, so it is difficult to treat her as a wife again. (2) As described in the letter, the man has no responsibility in morality or in law. Remarrying does not constitute bigamy. (3) A statement should be published in the newspaper to sever the relationship between husband and wife and describe the whole story, so as to avoid her illegal activities abroad, which may cause unexpected entanglements.</p>

<h3>Recombination Committee Adjusts Allotted Yarn; Count Not Applicable; Setting Up Exchange Still Under Consideration; Those Who Did Not Apply Before Please Add More</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The yarn allocation committee of the Cotton Yarn Recombination Industry Association is responsible for the allocation and sale of cotton yarn. The second batch of 5,626 pieces and 25, totaling 6,002 pieces and 908 of the standard 20 count, were issued yesterday. Because it was the first time, the textile building and various private yarn mills had changed the payment time. It is said that the payment must be cleared before the close of the market on Saturday. The textile building entrusted the Bank of China to collect the money, which was closed at noon. The private factories were extended to the afternoon. The distribution standard is still the same as the previous decision. However, the count of yarn from the yarn mills is not exactly the same as the last time, so the type and quantity of yarn that each factory has been allocated will also be slightly different. Generally, there is a surplus of coarse yarn and a shortage of fine yarn. There was a surplus of 10-count coarse yarn last time, and this time the surplus will be even greater. How to handle it next time is still subject to the decision of the Textile Management Committee. According to Mr. Shihao, the person in charge of the recombination committee, many colleagues from various guilds did not have time to participate in the second sale because of the urgency. Now, according to the declaration, the unallocated factories have been re-examined, and a list has been prepared and reported to the Textile Management Committee, requesting an increase in the allocation and sale. As for the actual amount of the previous sale, a list has been prepared and reported. For the previous sale, the recombination committee never forced the factories to accept the allocation, and it was clearly stated to each factory that even if they gave up, their allocation qualification would not be cancelled. However, each factory felt interested because it was a new creation, and most of them accepted the yarn allocated by the association. However, the count of yarn from the yarn mills did not match the predetermined plan, and there was a shortage of fine yarn, which was mixed with coarse yarn. Of course, it cannot be fully met in practice. The recombination committee is planning to set up an exchange to facilitate the exchange of each allocated household. The recombination committee is based on the degree of opening for the yarn usage quantity of each factory as the allocation standard. The recombination committee authorities also believe that improvements are needed due to the declaration being made in advance and the incomplete investigation. Recently, various associations have been inspecting and reviewing at random. According to the heads of various associations, the recombination committee reported that the crackdown on resale is extremely strict. If the allocated yarn exceeds the quantity, it will be deducted from the allocated quantity in the next period. The Dyeing and Weaving Industry Association has also allocated and sold some dyeing factories that have always prepared yarn for self-dyeing, but has convened a meeting to strictly restrict the price increase and resale. It is said that the allocation quota for this factory has been reduced this time, and the reduced quota and the surplus quota are used as return orders, and will not be transferred again. It is said that the number of return orders last time was more than 300 pieces in each association. In addition to a large number of return orders for 10-count yarn this time, there are also many remaining orders for 32-count cone yarn. The operating expenses required by each association have been reported to the Textile Management Committee for collection from each factory. Mayor Wu once ordered the yarn factory industry to return the yarn price collected by the black market for over-ordered yarn to customers. According to Mr. Pan, the recombination industry believes that it is not necessary to do so uniformly.</p>
<h3>The Market's Speculative Atmosphere Is Quite Strong; Gold Price Rises Another 60,000</h3>
<p>Spot gold continued to rise, with brisk customer sales creating a very firm market atmosphere. The morning opened strongly at 2.4 million, and initially fluctuated around that price. After 10:00 AM, the Central Bank allocated 120 bars at 2,400,250 each. Afterwards, buying interest intensified, with individual buyers carrying gold away, actual sales remaining robust, and buyers actively participating. Although there was some supply, it was not readily available. The price rose to 2,435,000 near midday, hovering around 2,430,000 at noon. In the afternoon, market sentiment grew even more bullish, with increased speculation. Next-day transactions rose to 2,460,000, resulting in a further increase of 65,000 compared to the previous close. Gold ornaments were priced up to 2.46 million. Silver bullion remained steady, while silver dollars saw a slight rebound. Illegal interest rates were around 15%. Foreign currencies remained stable, solely driven by the gold market's momentum. U.S. dollar black market rates were between 4,100 and 4,150, slightly higher than the previous close. Hong Kong dollars strengthened slightly due to the stimulus of the gold market, but because telegraphic transfers remained loose, the rise was weak, eventually recovering ten dollars. There was no clear direction for Hong Kong currency, with transactions at 865 considered relatively frequent. Indian currency traded between 1,045 and 1,055. British currency was around 14,000. U.S. dollar official rates remained unchanged, and reciprocal transactions had not yet commenced.</p>
<h3>Government Bonds Plummet</h3>
<p>Government bonds plummeted yesterday due to reports that the National Defense Council had proposed a two-for-one arrangement for pre-war fixed-term deposits, leading to a sell-off by long positions. Unified bonds (Type C) opened in the morning at 1,500, immediately facing sell-offs from speculative long positions and firms like Fuyuan. The price soon plummeted to 1,170 before being supported by a certain firm on the eighth floor and Chengde. At noon, the price hovered around 1,250, resulting in a decline of 360 compared to the previous close. Types A, B, and D each fell 230, while Type E also dropped 150, with transactions reaching 5 million.</p>
<h3>Cotton Cloth Evaluation Committee to Discuss Retail Prices Today</h3>
<p>As winter approaches, there is a great need for various sectors to prepare cotton clothing. The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau has specifically scheduled a Cotton Cloth Evaluation Committee meeting for 3:00 PM today in the Bureau's conference room to discuss future cotton cloth retail prices and legitimate profit margins.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cloth Continue to Rise; 20-Count Yarn Rises 30,000-40,000; Cloth Prices Up 1,000-2,000</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Yesterday, the yarn market continued to show strength. Although various customer groups added to their orders, the quantities were small. Cantonese customers were still interested in heavy-weight yarns. In addition, weaving factories were making up for unfilled northern sales, so market sentiment grew firmer. The "Double Horse" brand once again reached a high price of 2.25 million. The "Tianfu Woman" brand from Tianjin and Yingkou was particularly strong due to extremely tight supply. Although the price slightly retreated at the close, the foundation was very firm. As a result, 20-count yarn rose another 30,000 to 40,000. Fine yarns remained sluggish. Customer sales in the cloth market also slightly improved. Afternoon market prices rose by 1,000 to 2,000. Counter sales on the street gradually became more active, but goods from the Textile Construction Company did not see improvement, mostly selling at breakeven prices. Spot goods were slightly higher, with "Dragon Head" fine cloth selling for 80,000 and "Blue Chicken" for 77,000.</p>
<h3>Last Month's Check Clearing; Bounced Checks Set New Record</h3>
<p>According to the Clearing House, the total value of check clearings for all banks and firms in the city's financial industry last month exceeded 6 trillion, with discrepancies reaching 621.57 billion, 22.2696 million, and 36 cents. A breakdown of the highest, lowest, and average clearing numbers for the entire month is as follows: (1) The highest was on the 28th of last month, reaching over 290 billion; (2) The lowest was on the 18th of last month, reaching over 205 billion; (3) The average daily amount was 241 billion. In addition, the total number of bounced checks reached a staggering 103,493, totaling over 195 billion, exceeding previous records.</p>
<h3>Despite Many Covering Short Positions in Chinese Stocks, the Market Shows No Improvement</h3>
<p>Chinese stocks saw buying interest weakened as the Securities Exchange authorities were unable to schedule deferred settlement auctions, pending approval from the Ministry, disappointing buyers. However, continuous short covering led to rangebound trading despite declines. At the opening, stocks showed signs of weakness, with long positions closing and pushing prices lower, but prices were rangebound, and short covering occurred after declines, resulting in an uncertain situation. Both buyers and sellers traded sporadically, lacking significant activity. From 11:00 to 11:30, prices gradually rose after declines, with numbers 166, 97, and 198 all seeing short covering, briefly rising above the opening prices, but it was fleeting. In less than five minutes, sell-offs resumed. Under the combined pressure of sporadic supply, prices fell again after 11:45. Compared to the previous close, popular stocks such as Yong Yarn, Meyer, Trust Harmony, Jingfu, Xinguang, and Qinxing each fell slightly to half a percent. Cold stocks such as Datong Matches, Yonggong, Luoan, Wuhe, and Jinglun Underwear remained stable, with China Textiles rising slightly, and the rest declining slightly. The afternoon saw a stagnant situation, with light trading. Only China Textiles and Wuhe experienced slight fluctuations, while the rest remained rangebound. As a result, compared to the previous close, popular stocks Yong Yarn, Meyer, Jingfu, Trust Harmony, Xinguang, and Qinxing each fell between 2% and breakeven, while cold stocks such as the Company and Lian remained flat, Matches rose half a percent, China Textiles Underwear and Jinglun rose slightly, Wuhe fell 10%, and the rest declined slightly. The total trading volume was 11.75 million shares. Over-the-counter stocks were generally stable with little change.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks remained initially stable but weakened, with new buying absent. Except for Ewo Brewery, which remained relatively stable, the rest felt weak. Compared to the previous close, Ewo Brewery remained flat, while Ewo Yarn, Meyer, and Associated Industries declined slightly. Jardine Matheson, Paper Industries, Shipping Industries, and Steel Industries each fell about half a percent.</p>
<h3>Japonica and Indica Rice Are Flat and Weak; Edible Oil Prices Fluctuate</h3>
<p>The rice market saw a total of over 12,000 shi of rice arriving from the north and south, with mediocre digestion. Japonica rice gradually declined, with northern markets retreating by a small amount of 1,000. Yangdu Indica rice was soft, while wharves Indica rice was stable. White Yuan rice remained stagnant and weak, with Yin Yuan rice offering discounts for quick sales. White Yuan rice in the southern market was flat and weak, while Japonica and Indica rice saw no difference. Wheat demand was stagnant, with prices falling 300-400. Flour sales were sluggish, with some supply arriving, and prices falling 300-500, with a soft outlook. Wheat bran followed with a decrease of 100-200. Soybean cake trading showed signs of stopping, with sales becoming stagnant, declining 100-200, and the future looking bleak. Soybeans from Northeast and Central China were arriving, but oil factories were not eager to purchase. Sales in various ports were inactive, falling 300-1,000. Broad beans from Fujian were being purchased but not heavily consumed. Sales in the city remained flat, and the market was temporarily stable. Sorghum sources were scarce, and distilleries had normal demand, leading to a neglected situation. Cowpeas from Nanyang saw some interest. Sesame sales were slackening. Shelled peanuts continued to rise 1,000-2,000. Red beans lacked buyers, plummeting 2,000-3,000. Soybean cake sales in Xiamen stopped, with prices falling 100-200. The oil market saw mixed price movements. The edible oil market was active, rebounding 2,000-3,000. Soybean oil was firm.

<h3>Southern Transportation of Yarn and Cloth Can Begin Next Monday</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The names of the manufacturers approved for the southern transport of yarn and cloth were announced yesterday by the Textile Management Committee. Of the 262 factories that applied, 232 were approved. Of the 392 commercial firms that applied, 134 were approved. 64 commercial firms were asked to provide additional documents for further review. The Textile Management Committee has already issued notification slips to the qualified manufacturers, asking them to come to the committee to collect registration cards and application forms. It is expected that applications for southern transport of yarn and cloth can begin next week.</p>
<p>It is understood that the allocation of cotton yarn for southern transport will be based on the factory's spindle count and production volume. Commercial firms wishing to apply for export must first obtain a sales permit from the factory before applying to the Textile Management Committee for southern transport. The allocation of cloth for southern transport will be reviewed four times in January. The allocation of cloth for southern transport will be based on the factory's production volume. For commercial firms, the standard will be the scope of their past sales to various ports in South China.</p>
<h3>Limited Supply from the Fuel Management Committee; The Bituminous Coal Market Is Stirred Again; Fewer Stocks, More Applicants; The Association Will Formulate Concrete Measures</h3>
<p>Since the 26th of last month, after the Fuel Management Committee adjusted coal prices and notified the Coal Business Joint Operations Office to suspend sales, rumors spread among the industry. Fortunately, through the efforts of the association, sales resumed as usual on the 1st of this month, but the quota was limited to only 20,000 tons per month, and the market turmoil temporarily calmed down. Industry applications were extremely enthusiastic. As of the 4th of this month, the Joint Operations Office had distributed 11,000 tons. To maintain the actual sales of the industry for the second half of the month and to avoid manipulation, the association ordered the Joint Operations Office to temporarily suspend sales starting today, and sales will resume after the association formulates concrete measures. Currently, the Joint Operations Office's coal stocks only consist of the remaining 9,000 tons allocated by the Fuel Management Committee for this month and the 6,000 tons quota from last month, for a total of 15,000 tons, which has made the industry even more uneasy. Some businesses have already pre-sold goods to users and are unable to replenish them from the Joint Operations Office, so they are searching for them on the black market, which has caused the black market price of bituminous coal to soar, higher by 10,000 to 40,000 per ton compared to the Joint Operations Office's allocation price, especially bituminous coal dust.</p>
<h3>Many Difficulties in Fur Export; Northern Transportation Has Not Recovered, New Goods Have Not Arrived; Export Rights Are Controlled by Foreigners, Unfavorable Terms</h3>
<p>[Our Report] According to sources in the city's fur export industry, the fur samples displayed at the recent export commodity exhibition aroused the interest of a Swiss affairs officer. He contacted the industry to collect various exquisite fur products and send personnel to Switzerland to hold an exhibition. The industry stated that the city's fur inventory was in a period of shortage. New goods had not arrived, and existing inventory was running low. Most of the valuable fur products come from North China. Furthermore, due to transportation difficulties, it was impossible to purchase them temporarily. Therefore, it was impossible to collect all kinds of fur products and send personnel to Switzerland for an exhibition. It was decided to purchase goose and duck feathers and sheepskins in the Jiangsu and Zhejiang areas and send them to Switzerland for a small exhibition. The industry's recent fur exports are mainly to New York, but the situation is not good, and trade is largely controlled by Jewish merchants. Although Chinese businesses want to trade directly with foreign countries, the terms are very unfavorable. For example, they have to pay an additional business tax. Although the commodity tax is said to be exempt, it still has to be paid first and then deducted. In addition, the interest rate is only 6% per annum abroad, but even the low interest rate of the Central Bank in China is 5% per month. Under these difficult circumstances, it is impossible to compete with foreign exporters.</p>
<h3>Preferential Treatment for Fellow Banks; Central Bank Reduces Exchange Rate</h3>
<p>It is understood that the Central Bank, to facilitate commercial banks, has granted a 30% discount on the exchange rate stipulated by the bank. This measure was decided at the recent bank affairs meeting and is now being implemented.</p>
<h3>More Pigs Arriving; Fresh Meat Prices Have Begun to Fall</h3>
<p>Since the war in northern Jiangsu gradually subsided and order was restored, the authorities, to facilitate civilian ships and commercial transport, have re-designated ports such as Nantong and Tianshengang on the north bank of the Yangtze River as navigable ports. As a result, pigs, a special product of northern Jiangsu, have recently arrived in large quantities. It is estimated that more than 3,000 heads are transported daily by both water and land routes. Fresh meat prices have begun to fall, with wholesale prices falling by 40,000 per 100 catties and retail prices falling by 200 to 400 per catty.</p>
<h3>The Market Is Depressed; There Are More Rumors</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Recently, rumors have been spreading that several reputable and financially strong companies and firms in the city are experiencing financial difficulties. These rumors are being used as gossip in the market. According to reporters' interviews with the companies and firms concerned, it is true that working capital has occasionally run dry due to the current tightening of credit, but it has not reached a serious stage. The exaggerated rumors circulating recently are excessive. In the daily accounts of various companies and firms, there are frequent instances of borrowing from other firms or relatives and friends. Due to the rumors, some are demanding early repayment or withdrawing deposits, which has caused the situation to become tense. Currently, various companies and firms have prepared sufficient cash to meet withdrawals. Public sentiment is gradually stabilizing.</p>
<h3>More Timber Arriving</h3>
<p>[Our Report] A large quantity of timber has been imported this week. Large pine trees are stranded at the mouth of the Suzhou River at the Baidu Bridge. It may be difficult to transport such a large amount of timber elsewhere in a short time. Yesterday, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Lin Sen ship arrived from Fuzhou, also carrying 2,300 tons of wooden boards.</p>
<p>In terms of exports, some yarn and cloth were transported to the north. Yesterday, the Qimei ship sailed to Tianjin, carrying 500 pieces of cotton cloth, 185 pieces of cotton yarn, 1,680 bags of sugar, over 700 boxes of tea, and 300 pieces of iron sheets. Yesterday, the Pede ship sailed to Shantou, carrying a large quantity of over 52,590 pieces of soybean cake, as well as 450 bags of sesame.</p>
<h3>Cotton Collection Not Strong; The Reason Is Transportation Difficulties</h3>
<p>The collection of domestically produced cotton is nearing completion. According to reports received by the Textile Construction Company from various locations, the total amount collected by various cotton collection points in Xi'an, Shashi, Hankou, Nantong, and Tianjin is only over 100,000 dan. There are still a small portion of reports that have not been received, and the estimated quantity is also limited. This year, the cotton collection locations of both state-owned and private yarn factories are concentrated in areas with convenient transportation. They are unwilling to go to places with transportation difficulties, so the poor cotton collection is unprecedented. The amount of raw materials for yarn factories next year will rely on more foreign cotton than in previous years.</p>
<h3>Italian Rayon Production; Monthly Increase</h3>
<p>[Reuters Milan, Italy, 5th] Italian rayon production is gradually increasing and has now reached 32% of the production level at the beginning of the war. The production volume for September was 5,768,847 kilograms, while August was 5,237,706 kilograms. The average monthly production volume in 1941 was 16,395,142 kilograms.</p>
<h3>Sugar Prices Remain Weak</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market showed no signs of recovery. The association's posted spot prices for #20 medium white sugar were 133,500, and raw sand red sugar was 113,500. Among the listed goods, Shantou firms offered an upfront price of 116,000 for high-quality light blue sugar, Guangdong firms offered 103,000 for Qingyuan sliced light blue sugar, Hainan red sugar at 115,000, and Xinghua firms offered 116,000 to 114,000 for Xinghua red sugar.

<h3>China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and Petroleum Company; Jointly Form Oil Tanker Company</h3>
<p>To facilitate the transportation of petroleum in the northwest, the China Petroleum Company has recently jointly formed the China Oil Tanker Company with the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. The preparatory office is currently located inside the China Tobacco Company on Jiangxi Road, and the preparatory work is actively underway. It is understood that the company plans to explore the purchase of several oil tankers from foreign countries, which will operate in various domestic and foreign production and sales ports in the future. It is reported that the positions of general manager and deputy general manager will be held by Weng Wenhao and Xu Xueyu, respectively.</p>
<h3>Prices of Native Products in the U.S. Market; Silk Price $7.25</h3>
<p>The Bank of China's Foreign Exchange Department in New York cabled on the 5th: Japanese silk is non-existent in the market. The U.S. government will auction 5,000 bales of Chinese silk on the 11th, with transactions at $7.25. Italian silk is quiet. Tianjin 55 long bristles are quoted at $9.25, with a bid of $8.50; 55 short bristles are quoted at $5.50, with a bid of $5.20; Hankou bristles are quoted at $4.15, with a bid of $4; Chongqing bristles are quoted at $3.10, with a bid of $2.85; Shanghai bristles are quoted at $2.25, with a bid of $2.10. After the price limit on tung oil was lifted, there were transactions last week at $0.385 per pound. Tanker cargo, Shanghai ex-ship delivery is quoted at $0.3525. After the price limit on feathers was lifted, there is no market. Zhejiang sheepskins are quoted at $2.00, with a bid of $1.85. Yellow weasel skins are quoted at $2.75, with a bid of $2.50. Sausage casings are quoted at $0.93 due to the rise in the European market, with a bid of $0.73, but no one is selling. There are no changes in other products.</p>
<h3>The Knitting Industry's Urgent Demands; Reduce Interest and Taxes; Revise Wage Standards</h3>
<p>The Municipal Industrial Association holds various industry symposiums every Tuesday to promote industrial development. Yesterday afternoon, the knitting industry symposium was held, with seven representatives from the industry, including Xu Zhaohou, attending. The Bank of Communications also sent Zhuang Shenwen, director of the Design Department, and Zhang Muliao, commissioner, to attend. According to the industry, the current difficulties they face are the burden of high-interest loans, wages, and taxes, which makes it impossible to compete with products from other countries in foreign trade. Before the war, Nanyang and the United States had good sales of Chinese knitted products. Although there is still demand now, they are reluctant to buy due to the high prices. At the same time, raw material prices are rising sharply, making it difficult to buy the same amount of raw materials with the proceeds from sales. Currently, the industry is requesting: (1) low-interest loans, (2) reduced taxes, and (3) revised wage standards. The Bank of Communications representatives suggested that the issue of low-interest loans should be studied first to determine an effective approach. If it can encourage large-scale exports, the bank can certainly share the benefits. As for the tax issue, after the symposium, they will formulate accurate figures for the authorities to adopt. For the wage issue, they will study the Factory Law and submit proposed revisions to the authorities for approval. Regarding the difficulty in balancing raw material price fluctuations and sales prices, they will discuss with the state-owned China Textile Corporation to facilitate them.</p>
<h3>Rice Prices in Hubei Province Rebound</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hankou, 6th] Grain prices in various parts of Hubei Province have generally risen. The price of high-quality rice is approaching 50,000 per shi. The plan to adjust grain prices to avoid low grain prices, which was previously proposed, will be temporarily postponed.</p>
<h3>Lack of Chemical Fertilizers; Taiwan's Sugar Production Greatly Affected</h3>
<p>[Our Report] It is understood that the Taiwan Sugar Corporation is currently facing the problem of a shortage of fertilizers. Under the 50-year rule of the Japanese, the farmers of Taiwan have become accustomed to using chemical fertilizers such as nitrogen, phosphoric acid, and ammonium sulfate. However, these fertilizers are all necessities during wartime. Therefore, all countries are experiencing shortages after the war, and China is no exception. There is no open market for these fertilizers in the world at present. Most of them are centrally allocated by the Allied Food Control Board, and the United Nations provides them to various countries. However, the United Nations allocates these fertilizers mainly for food crops. Sugar has been classified as a luxury item and cannot get a share. However, the sugar industry in Taiwan has a close relationship with the national economic development and the economic recovery of the province. If Taiwan's sugar cannot be grown due to some reason, at least 55% of the people in Taiwan will have to declare bankruptcy, which would turn Taiwan, which has made great contributions to the national economy, into a burden on the national economy. Also, the normal planting season for sugar cane in the province is October, November, December, and January of each year. If planting is not completed during this period, all the three-year and five-year recovery plans for the Chinese sugar industry will be completely aborted. It is said that the Taiwan Sugar Corporation is currently in a depressed state and is planning to actively overcome the difficulties.</p>

<h3>Sino-American Commercial Treaty: From Proposal to Signing</h3>
<p>— Nanjing Dispatch, 4th Day. Our Correspondent, Hande Jie</p>
<p>Conception</p>
<p>The Sino-American Commercial Treaty, long in the making, was finally signed at 4:00 PM on November 4th. This is a substantial and important offspring, gestated for three years and ten months. It's no wonder its birth was a difficult labor. The press corps acted as midwives, urging and chanting, finally delivering it today. It truly wasn't easy.</p>
<p>The initial mention of the Sino-American Commercial Treaty was in Article 7 of the Sino-American New Treaty on January 11th, 1943. That article stipulated that both China and the United States agreed to commence negotiations within six months after the end of the righteous war in which both countries were striving for victory. The goal was to reorganize, select, eliminate, and reaffirm all existing, piecemeal provisions scattered throughout outdated treaty articles (mostly unequal treaties), or in de facto commercial, overseas Chinese, economic, navigation, and consular relations between the two countries. The aim was to create a perfect commercial treaty that complied with current international practices, would not subject Sino-American relations to unexpected turmoil, and would be all-encompassing and universally suitable. However, from then until victory, the United States focused on achieving victory in Europe and preparing for active operations in Asia. China was preparing for a counter-offensive while dealing with the enemy's final frenzy. No matter who was seen, during the height of the war, no one could forget the war and remember matters after victory. Thus, this provision was vaguely forgotten for a long time. This seed, once planted, lay dry and dormant for over two years.</p>
<p>Formation</p>
<p>Last spring, with victory approaching, the Allied nations began preparing for the post-victory situation. They began planning the establishment of the cornerstone of peace. The United Nations Conference on International Organization opened in San Francisco on April 25th. Those thinking of restoration and reconstruction remembered what needed to be done. Preliminary contacts regarding the signing of the Sino-American Commercial Treaty took place in Washington. Our country's leading commercial authority (then Commercial Counselor at the Embassy in the United States), economist Gong Duxiu (Director of the Economic Research Institute of the National Resources Commission), and Assistant Commercial Counselor Liu Dazhong, representing the government, exchanged views with the United States Department of State on several occasions. As summer turned to fall, victories were achieved in Europe and Asia. The economic relations between the United States and its allies became even closer. The friendship between China and the United States was always at its highest. Economic cooperation, industrial and commercial mutual assistance, was the necessary path to maintaining American prosperity and promoting China's construction. But to secure guarantees for all normal operations, a standard and regulation were essential. The Sino-American Commercial Treaty entered a phase of concretization. Washington put forward its desired draft, which was brought to Chongqing by Gong Duxiu and others. The Treaty Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs became busy. In early February, they gathered opinions from various related government departments, assessed the post-war situation in our country, consulted experts and scholars, and proposed a counter-proposal. Formal negotiations began, with our representatives being Gong Duxiu (who, after returning to the country, had assumed the post of Deputy Secretary-General of the Supreme Economic Council), Wang Huacheng, Director of the Treaty Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and Cheng Ximeng, Advisor and Director of the American Affairs Department. The American representatives were Counselor Smothers (who has now been transferred to the post of Consul General in Tianjin), Baxter, and Dr. Wilson, a special advisor dispatched by the State Department and a professor of international law at Duke University. (He came in early February, made some decisions on principles, and returned home in March.)</p>
<p>The draft and counter-proposal were like the two cotyledons of a small plant. A young sprout extracts nutrients from these two cotyledons and slowly grows and takes shape.</p>
<p>Development</p>
<p>Starting in February of last year, this young sprout grew bit by bit. The two sides negotiated one article at a time. The technical work of drafting the agreed results into articles was done by Chen Shicai, Assistant of the American Affairs Department, and Yu Nengmo, Wang Zhixu, Tao Yue, and others, assistants and specialists of the Treaty Department. They, like the representatives, worked hard, patiently, and cautiously, carefully writing down and translating identical views word by word. The young sprout grew and developed day by day, and the Sino-American Commercial Treaty was agreed upon sentence by sentence. But at this time, the domestic political atmosphere was intense. The Political Consultative Conference, military reorganization, the Second Plenary Session of the Kuomintang, and the People's Political Council followed one after another. The press corps didn't notice that the Sino-American Commercial Treaty was already in the development stage. In early April, our newspaper was the first to publish a Chongqing dispatch stating that "the Sino-American Commercial Treaty is under negotiation." Everyone then knew about it. In late April, various newspapers published a Reuters dispatch from Hong Kong stating that "the Sino-American Commercial Treaty is under negotiation." No one knew if these two dispatches were a single entity manifested in two forms, but the matter was confirmed. Although due to the strict secrecy maintained by all relevant parties, it was always difficult to obtain more information.</p>

<p>Signatures of the representatives signing the Sino-American Commercial Treaty, as requested by our correspondent. (Dispatch from Correspondent Hande Jie)</p>
<p>Growth</p>
<p>From Chongqing to Nanjing, negotiations continued. Difficulties arose constantly and were resolved constantly. The United States demanded more freedom for industrial and commercial operations and the safeguarding of domestic economic stability and national interests. China demanded foreign investment to help the development of national industries and the safety of overseas Chinese residents and their lives. These mutual demands, if reasonably coordinated, would never lead to conflicts of interest or power struggles. However, due to the lack of reasonable coordination in the past and the lingering effects of unequal treaties and discriminatory laws, conflicts were not uncommon, and both sides considered matters with extreme caution. On the Chinese side, this was the first commercial treaty after the abolition of unequal treaties. Nation-building was beginning, and it had to obtain as much foreign aid as possible, so the treaty had to be meticulous, especially in terms of security. On the American side, this was a major event after the war. The lessons of 1929 were not far away, and it had to rationally obtain access to the Eastern market and cooperation with China, so the treaty also had to be meticulous and secure. For this reason, many issues took up a lot of time, especially immigration, industrial and commercial operations, the reservation of mining rights, the definition of coastal trade, etc., which were discussed for a considerable time and resulted in the relevant provisions stipulated today. The Sino-American Commercial Treaty negotiations held nearly forty meetings. It grew slowly in this way.</p>
<p>Inspection</p>
<p>When a fetus grows in the mother's body, inspection is a necessary procedure. Only after inspection can a diagnosis be made as to whether it is normal and whether the birth will be smooth. The Sino-American Commercial Treaty also underwent inspection from time to time during its growth phase. During consultations, whenever important decisions had to be made, the U.S. side would send telegrams to Washington to inquire; our side also took it more seriously. Members of the National Political Council and the Executive Yuan all participated in the consultation. Legislative Yuan member Wu Jingneng (currently serving as the Envoy to the Holy See) also frequently contacted the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. After the initial draft was finalized in mid-October, it was reviewed by the National Defense Supreme Council. This thorough inspection ensured that the Sino-American Commercial Treaty would be approved smoothly by both countries. This period was the most stressful time for reporters, hoping for a quick and early birth, standing outside the delivery room waiting, and even trying to peek through the cracks in the door and listen. In late October, the Treaty Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was extremely busy, and Li Qian ran to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs almost every day. The official versions began to be handwritten in regular script and carefully typed, once, twice, and proofread dozens of times. When the Information Department answered inquiries, they said, "Soon!" "Soon!"</p>
<p>Birth</p>
<p>This plump baby was finally born; the plenipotentiary representatives were dispatched, and the date and location were set. The Sino-American Commercial Treaty was born.</p>
<p>On the afternoon of November 4th, the signing ceremony was formally held in the conference room on the third floor of the Executive Yuan. The interior layout was mostly the same as usual, solemn and simple. On the left wall were the national flag and the portrait of the Founding Father, and opposite was a group photo of Chairman Chiang in military uniform. Two rows of seats were arranged on both sides, all covered with clean white cloth. In the center was a long table and five high-backed chairs with brocade cushions. The long table was covered with a brand new small checkered white tablecloth. On the left side was a set of jade-green Western-style stationery, and on the right side was a complete set of Chinese-style stationery. There were four volumes of the treaty, two originals and two copies. The set preserved by China had a deep red leather cover, embossed with the "Blue Sky White Sun" emblem, and the endpapers were plain silk. The set preserved by the United States had a dark blue leather cover, with gold-embossed borders and the gold-embossed eagle emblem, and the endpapers were plain silk with gold-embossed edges. Each volume was in both Chinese and English, with the Chinese text first in the volumes preserved by China, and the English text first in the volumes preserved by the United States. Each volume had two red, white, and blue silk ribbons attached to the end, and the wax seals of the four signing representatives were firmly affixed. Their order of precedence and the order of signing were arranged according to the principle of the possessor taking precedence. In front of the long table were five mercury lamps, although it was facing away from the door.</p>
<p>At three o'clock, reporters arrived one after another. The photographers from the Central News Agency were testing the lighting. Director Wang Huacheng was busy with Assistant Yu Nengmo and Attache Andeber from the U.S. Embassy, applying wax seals. All the preparations were completed in a short period of time. At 3:30, Foreign Minister Wang arrived, inspected the various preparations, and chatted with Minister Wang Yunwu and Executive Secretary Gan Naiguang. In less than three minutes, Ambassador Stuart, Consul General Smothers, and Counselor Baxter entered the room together. President Song, Vice President Weng, and Secretary-General Chiang arrived next. Everyone shook hands with each other, chatted briefly, and then the signing ceremony began amidst the whirring of cameras. President Song sat in the center of the long table, with our representatives on his right and the U.S. representatives on his left. After taking their seats, they first verified each other's full powers, and then began signing. Foreign Minister Wang and Director Wang first signed their Chinese names on the Chinese version with brushes, and then switched to their own fountain pens to sign their English names on the English version. Ambassador Stuart and Counselor Smothers signed all their names using their own gray-stemmed Parker 51 pens. After the representatives of both sides signed the original and copies preserved by their own countries, they exchanged them and signed the original and copies preserved by the other party. The signing was completed precisely at four o'clock. Everyone stood up. President Song first shook hands with Ambassador Stuart to thank each other. Then Foreign Minister Wang also shook hands warmly with Ambassador Stuart. Representatives and guests also shook hands and thanked each other. Champagne and sandwiches arrived. President Song picked up two glasses and handed one to Ambassador Stuart. "Congratulations for mutual help and cooperation." The two raised their glasses high and drank heartily. Immediately, the atmosphere in the conference room changed from solemn to lively. Glasses clinked, laughter filled the air, and the aroma of wine mingled with the joyful atmosphere, overflowing inside and outside the room. This plump newborn was born; the signing and announcement of the Sino-American Commercial Treaty was made. This is an epoch-making product. From now on, Sino-American relations will have a new basis, and the sincere friendship and cooperation between the two countries will surely develop rapidly with this new era.</p>
<h3>Henan Provincial Assembly: A Democratic Drama Where Tongues Were Drawn, Only To Be Sheathed Again</h3>
<p>— Kaifeng Dispatch, October 28th. Our Correspondent, Wang Shoumei</p>
<p>The Henan Provincial Assembly staged a tongue-lashing yesterday (October 28th) that was alarming but harmless. I hardly dare think back on it. Thinking about it still makes me tremble with fear. Imagine, when those angry, furious warriors were speaking passionately and heatedly, not agreeing with each other, what if some unscrupulous person had thrown a brick through the window? Wouldn't inkstones and teacups have flown everywhere? If that had happened, chaos would have erupted. Who could guarantee that the airborne weapons wouldn't have eyes and wouldn't fall on the reporter's head? But, thank God, we didn't encounter such an unfortunate event. Therefore, I feel that although I suffered a false alarm, it really opened my eyes.</p>
<h3>More Than Thirty Assemblymen Make an Emergency Motion</h3>
<p>Some sensitive people had predicted that yesterday morning's general assembly would definitely have a fierce battle, so the press box was already packed. But the assembly started for a long time, and there was no movement. After the secretariat and the resident committee presented their work reports, everything was calm. Chairman Liu then announced the discussion of proposals. Just then, someone stood up from among the assemblymen. He shouted tensely, "Chairman, number forty-seven, number forty-seven, I have an emergency motion!" The whole place was somewhat shaken. Everyone focused their gaze on the speaker, Assemblyman Yu Qixian. He held a solemn attitude, walked with heavy and forceful steps, and took his "emergency motion" to the front of the chairman's seat. He handed the "emergency motion" to Secretary-General Han, who in turn passed it to Chairman Liu. Chairman Liu, whose cultivation had reached a high level, looked at it, folded the "emergency motion," and put it down. As soon as he did that, someone shouted, "Please, Chairman, read out the contents of the emergency motion!" So Chairman Liu handed the emergency motion to Secretary-General Han to read out. The main idea of the motion was that Chairman Liu of the provincial government was loyal to the country and had contributed to the region. During the war, he had endured hardships and supported the war effort. After the restoration, he had managed things painstakingly. Now, having attended this assembly, he had been subjected to serious accusations and had led all the members of the provincial committee to request their resignation. Everyone expressed regret and believed that the assembly should send a telegram to the central government to retain them. Signed to this emergency motion were Wang Puqing and more than thirty others. No sooner had Secretary-General Han finished reading than Assemblyman Liu Jiyan, number sixty, stood up. With a solemn attitude, he expressed his serious opinion. He said, "Chairman Liu has led the entire provincial committee to resign because of the criticism and accusations made by Assemblyman Wang Youmei. I regret this more than anyone else. Chairman Liu and I have been old friends for thirty years, and our private relationship is very close. I am unwilling to be second to anyone in retaining Chairman Liu. However, since Chairman Liu's decision to resign was due to the criticism leveled at him by this assembly, this assembly cannot abandon its position as a representative of the people and come out to retain him. Therefore, I propose that we retain him in our personal capacities. I do not agree to retain him in the name of the assembly!" Before Assemblyman Liu had finished speaking, someone else shouted, "Chairman, number one hundred." That was someone sitting in the last row, in his thirties, wearing a green uniform, speaking with a northern Henan accent. According to the seating chart, it was Assemblyman Yang Yufu. He said, "At the opening ceremony the day before yesterday, Chairman Liu believed that the assembly did not understand him because Assemblyman Wang Youmei gave the reply speech. In fact, Assemblyman Wang's opinion cannot represent all of us. Moreover, at the opening ceremony of this assembly, Chairman Liu was a guest. In the reply speech, he said, 'Handing over the bank to the central government, Chairman Liu and Director Meng had exchange conditions, saying something about a bureau chief, and so on.' May I ask Assemblyman Wang Youmei if you have any basis for this? If you have evidence, then present it. If you don't, then you are weak. If you make empty talk without evidence, you must take responsibility. Assemblyman Wang Youmei is arbitrary and considers no one else. The conscription case he proposed this time did not seek my consent in advance, and he stole my name. How can such arbitrariness and monopolization be allowed?" He sat down angrily, still holding his hat and slapping it on the table a few times. A portion of the audience even applauded. Assemblyman Wang Youmei stood up again to defend himself, saying, "Requesting a reduction in conscription is a matter of utmost urgency for Henan at present and is a major issue that needs to be discussed by this assembly. Due to the short time and the lack of time to get individual signatures, this is how it was done. Moreover, you often instructed me that when I encounter cases that have a major impact on the welfare of the people, I am willing to go along. This time, I didn't know that you disagreed, so I signed your name for you." At this time, heads were surging, and too many people wanted to express their opinions. Some were shouting "Chairman" here, and others were shouting "Chairman" there. The war of words had entered its most intense stage. The disorder was indescribable. Assemblyman Guo Haichang firmly opposed retaining Chairman Liu in the name of the assembly. Assemblyman Zhao Peiwu also shouted loudly, "If we retain Chairman Liu in our personal capacities, I will sign first. If we retain Chairman Liu in the name of the assembly, I firmly oppose it!" Assemblyman Shang Shaohang spoke, saying, "...We assemblymen can by no means retain Chairman Liu in the name of the assembly. Since ancient times, there have been loyal ministers who dared to remonstrate. This assembly represents the people and points out criticisms to the government, which is precisely being loyal to the people and loyal to the government. If Chairman Liu resigns entirely because his ears cannot bear loyal words, then if our assembly comes out to retain him, that would be equivalent to admitting that we are not loyal!" Assemblyman Wang Shiqu added, "This assembly should only thank the guest speaker for representing his people to express gratitude. It is inappropriate to criticize the guest at a grand ceremony. Therefore, we fully agree to retain Chairman Liu in the name of the assembly. Assemblyman Wang Youmei's reply speech can only be regarded as his personal opinion. We absolutely do not agree with it."</p>
<h3>The Assembly Hall Is In A State of Emergency, and The Verbal Battle Enters An Intense Stage</h3>
<p>Swords were drawn, bows were strung, and war clouds were gathering. Assemblyman Wang Youmei stood up calmly. He first shouted, "Chairman, I have a few words to say in response!" Then he turned around and faced the rear left. "There is no explicit provision in the law that the chairman of the provincial government must be paid complimentary remarks at the opening ceremony of the assembly. I have not seen any provision in the law that prohibits assemblymen from criticizing the chairman of the provincial government in their reply speeches. I only know that assemblymen have the freedom to speak in the assembly. If everyone thinks that what I said should not have been said, or cannot represent everyone, I will naturally take responsibility for what I said. But you also have the freedom to speak. Why didn't you object at the time?" Another person stood up. That was Assemblyman Wang Puqing, number sixty-one. He was absolutely in favor of retaining Chairman Liu. His demeanor when speaking could be described as "imposing." His mouth was like a river. Before he had finished speaking, Liu Huandong, number fifty-five, shouted "Chairman" several times in a row. Then he used all his senses, first hammering the table a few times, and then speaking sternly. He said, "Whether Chairman Liu resigns and whether the assembly retains him is a secondary issue. However, I feel that Chairman Liu was appointed during a time of crisis. During the Central Plains War, people from all walks of life in this province crossed the Qinling Mountains and fled to Xi'an. He sat firmly in Nanxiang Sangping, directing the war of resistance and vowing to coexist with Henan, enduring hardships and supporting the remaining situation until the enemy surrendered. Who can compare to this spirit? Therefore, I say, without the Liu brothers, there would be no Henan. After the restoration, he worked extremely hard to clean up the shattered situation in Henan. Now we are still criticizing him in this way. I ask, do you still have a conscience? Moreover, Wang Puqing and several other assemblymen unanimously attacked and opposed retaining Chairman Liu in the name of the assembly. The two sides were evenly matched and on equal footing. You attacked me, and I attacked you, and neither side would give in. The tension in the entire venue had reached an extremely urgent point. I squeezed a handful of sweat, but I still had the greatest determination to see it through because I felt that a democratic drama like this was not easy to see!</p>

<h3>A Gentleman Loves Others With Virtue; A Loud Voice Overwhelmed The Audience</h3>
<p>In the midst of the uproar, Assemblyman Liu Jiyan, number sixty, finally overwhelmed the assembly with his loud voice. He said, "If we retain Chairman Liu in our personal capacities, I am willing to kowtow and bow to Chairman Liu. But to retain Chairman Liu in the name of the assembly after such a quarrel would not be glorious for Chairman Liu either. A gentleman loves others with virtue. I absolutely do not want to cause him to be even less honorable because I love him. At the same time, I feel that it would greatly diminish the dignity of the assembly. Let us not forget our own position!" A large part of the audience applauded. Assemblyman Lu Yunhan, number two, also rose in response. His unique argument was as follows: "Retaining Chairman Liu can be said to be a common feeling. However, whether we should retain him in the name of the assembly or in our personal capacities, I propose that after the meeting, one representative from each administrative district and the chairman thoroughly study this issue." Someone, a third party longing for peace, echoed him. Many people proposed to adjourn the meeting, but the warmongers continued to chatter incessantly, determined to win by force. Chairman Liu, who was old, virtuous, dignified, and calmly seated on the rostrum, stood up calmly at this time. He calmly made a comprehensive conclusion on the disputes of both sides and the opinions of the third party. He said, "Regarding this issue, I have something to prove. Retaining Chairman Liu is everyone's common opinion. In fact, we lightly began to work on the matter of retaining him yesterday in another way. If we use the assembly's name to retain Chairman Liu again, some people are concerned about the dignity of the assembly, and it is indeed necessary to consider. As for which method to use, we can adopt the proposal of an assemblyman just now and have the representatives conduct a thorough study after the meeting. Now, let's start discussing the proposals." As soon as he finished speaking, he immediately began to read the proposals. Although many people were still eager to fight, they had no choice but to temporarily sheath their knives. Although there was almost another uproar when discussing the conscription case, after all, because it was too late and people were tired, they finally did not make a scene.</p>
<p>A fierce debate war, thanks to God, ended without any injuries. Otherwise, I think this democratic drama would definitely be included in the future "Romance of Democratic Politics in Henan."</p>
<h3>A Glimpse of Liangduo</h3>
<p>— Liangduo Dispatch, October 25th, Our Reporter Ling Songchou</p>
<p>The time was the afternoon of the 23rd.</p>
<p>The location was inside the forward command post of the Anfeng 83rd Division.</p>
<p>The frontline commander, Liu Guangyu, the one defending Taidian, got off his bicycle and walked up to Division Commander Li, saying:</p>
<p>"Three to four hundred enemies have been spotted across from Zhangjia She, moving towards the vicinity of Wangjia Xinyuan, with the intention of crossing the river for a sneak attack. We are now preparing to strike them head-on. Please advise, Division Commander." The Division Commander said:</p>
<p>"Strike what! Do they dare? If they cross the river, we'll just deal with them."</p>
<p>After some consideration, the Division Commander immediately ordered:</p>
<p>"The artillery positions should move towards Gujia Zao, preparing to fire. At the intersection of the two rivers across from Wangjia Xinyuan, the engineer battalion should strengthen fortifications and prepare to build a bridge. The heavy artillery near Caojia She should also begin preparations. The infantry will await intelligence tonight before taking action." After the deployment was completed, the Division Commander drew an arrow on the map with his finger, saying:</p>
<p>"Fighting here is just like Anfeng and Fuan; flanking maneuvers are essential, a frontal assault simply won't work!"</p>
<p>Having been there personally, the reporter understands that the fate of Liangduo has already been decided and the outcome will be known tomorrow. The sound of machine guns and artillery raged all night.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 24th, as expected, the reporter heard the good news that the National Army had recaptured Liangduo. He immediately rushed to the front line. The Division Commander was already there. The reporter asked the Division Commander bluntly:</p>
<p>"Has Liangduo been recaptured?"</p>
<p>"At five o'clock this morning," the Division Commander replied very forcefully. He pointed to Sanli'an on the map and said, "The vanguard troops have already crossed this place!" After a while, he took out a pre-determined action plan from his pocket square. On the map, the reporter noticed an arrow pointing to Liangduo, with "October 20th - 25th" written on its tail. The Division Commander said humorously:</p>
<p>"The reality will never exceed my predetermined plan. Haha! This is my magic weapon, my treasure!" At twelve o'clock, the adjutant's office sent personnel to set up camp in Liangduo. The reporter accompanied them to see this place that had been recaptured just seven hours ago.</p>
<p>Anfeng and Liangduo are only seven li apart. The drive took only ten minutes.</p>
<p>The streets were full of national flags, but they were all old. Some families simply pasted a piece of red paper onto a reed and hung it at the door as a welcome flag. Slogans were everywhere, red and green, adding a lot of vitality to a dead town. The residents were very enthusiastic about the National Army. Everyone unanimously called the National Army "Bodhisattvas." They were able to do their best to lend objects and assist with work. The Communist troops retreated from Liangduo around four o'clock; at five o'clock, the National Army moved into the town. When the National Army was advancing with guns blazing, the residents thought the battle was intense, and they crossed a river east of the town and took shelter in the countryside. Bullets and shells flew over their heads, scaring them all out of their wits. It wasn't until dawn that they learned that the National Army, for whom they had been longing, had arrived. One resident pointed to a wet piece of clothing and said to the reporter:</p>
<p>"If we had known that you 'Bodhisattvas' were coming, why would we have hidden? Look, we weren't killed by bullets, but we were almost drowned!"</p>
<p>There was very little fiat currency in the streets. They hadn't even seen some of the large denomination banknotes. The reporter personally heard a housewife say to her husband:</p>
<p>"Did you see that? The five and ten yuan notes are the same as before!" One person even took out a neatly folded stack of ten and five yuan fiat currency from his pocket to show the reporter; I thought, this must be an antique from eight years before the War of Resistance!</p>
<p>The doors of the shops were half-open, half-closed. The reporter couldn't even buy some yunpian gao (thin rice cakes) from the tea and snack shop. In the evening, buying some cabbage to make noodles still required the homeowner to go to great lengths. Prices have not yet returned to normal. Generally, ordinary things follow the price of rice, and the price of rice is based on the Anfeng area. Currently, the price of rice is roughly 36,000 yuan per dan (unit of dry measure, approx. 100 liters), for good quality.</p>
<p>The night before the Communist troops retreated, they distributed a lot of propaganda in Liangduo. The rapidly disintegrating Communist troops in northern Jiangsu still hadn't changed their old habit of fabricating facts, which only served to show their pathetic and desperate state!</p>
<p>On the one hand, the residents respected the National Army like "Bodhisattvas"; on the other hand, they feared them like a pitiful child encountering a stern father. They dared not say anything about the past. The reporter looked for a ten-yuan "anti-Japanese currency" note and, after much persuasion, finally obtained it. When he wanted to find a second one, they refused no matter what.</p>
<p>There are fewer men than women in Liangduo, and even fewer young people. Most of them have probably already escaped to live a life of exile. On one main street, there were only soldiers and no civilians. This phenomenon was quite unique! There are many children, and they are very lively. The reporter once asked a girl if she knew how to do the "yangko dance"? Her mother rushed to answer, "We don't understand." But after a while, when the reporter played two phrases on his harmonica, "5656i6i5i65323......," the children outside the door all hummed along. I secretly smiled to myself. Early in the morning of the 25th, Division Commander Li also arrived. The reporter accompanied him to inspect the artillery positions and took some photos. At the positions, the reporter could clearly see a certain temple and a pagoda on the outskirts of Dongtai City through special scissor-shaped binoculars. Liangduo is eighteen li from Dongtai. The range of the National Army's artillery positions has extended to Dongtai. The Division Commander smiled and said, "Even if the people don't catch up to him, the artillery has to catch up to him!"</p>
<p>Hello! Dongtai, we'll see each other before the end of the month!</p>
<h3>Scenes from Fanyang</h3>
<p>— Our Special Correspondent in the Northeast, Kai Rongqin, Airmail from Fanyang, October 6th</p>
<p>It's late autumn, but Shenyang is not too cold yet. The wind is not strong, and the sky, except when occasionally obscured by gray-white clouds, is mostly a bright blue. The bright sun often brings warmth to people. The people of the Northeast say that in the past, Shenyang had more cloudy days in autumn, often with unpleasant drizzles, but this year seems to be an exception.</p>
<p>The electricity is on, but the power supply is still insufficient. The circuits often malfunction. There's no electricity during the day, and even at night, it flickers on and off, symbolizing our current situation.</p>
<p>There are no major battles being fought in the Northeast right now, but after the sieges of Xichang, Xi'an, and other places were lifted, National Army generals such as Sun Liren, Liao Yaoxiang, and Long Tianwu still seemed to be coming and going in a hurry. Reporters, poking their heads around everywhere, couldn't figure out when they arrived and when they left.</p>
<p>Prices Rise Without End</p>
<p>Half a year ago, even three months ago, people coming from inside the border often praised the cheap prices in the Northeast. But now, no one says that anymore. In fact, they shake their heads and click their tongues, saying it's expensive. Rice has jumped to seventy or eighty yuan per jin (approx. 500g), and sorghum rice has also risen to more than twenty yuan. Pork is hard to get even at one hundred thirty or forty yuan per jin. Fur goods that are even slightly presentable cost thirty or forty thousand, and mink coats can even cost six or seven hundred thousand yuan. Many people are saying that if they had bought ten or eight fur coats half a year ago, they could have made a small fortune. Wealthy people, used to hearing the word "ten thousand" inside the border, don't care much about spending money outside the border. Public school teachers all shake their heads and sigh. Although buying gold has become a thing of the past, smugglers are particularly active. Transporting a hundred or so jin of rice from Jilin, Changchun, or Siping can earn several thousand to ten thousand yuan. Transporting apples and crabs from Haicheng and Yingkou also has a market profit of more than double. Who wouldn't do it! Even suffering for a few days in open train cars or on the roofs of covered cars, experiencing the same life as repatriating Japanese or even in damp warehouses with luggage, is worth it! A certain artist who had been buried in writing and painting in Jilin all day also put down his brush and came to Fanyang, trying to find a way to get a carload of goods. The exchange rate of one to thirteen has gradually become a historical term in Shenyang, where prices are soaring. Bank remittances are one to one and a half, and the value of unofficial circulating currency is even lower, with one yuan only exchanging for ten or even eight yuan of national currency.</p>
<p>Due to the high prices in Shenyang, goods from Tianjin and Beijing have been continuously transported here. Phrases like "American flints" and "American cigarettes" are encountered everywhere. The number of vendors selling cigarettes is increasing daily. Their numbers are probably no less than those of newspaper vendors, and they all display beautifully packaged American cigarettes prominently. Domestic cigarettes, even those transported from Shanghai, have been relegated to the cold palace. Even though the price is much cheaper than it was half a year ago, there are still not many customers.</p>
<p>Traffic Chaos - Vehicles Take Responsibility</p>
<p>The Municipal Provisional Assembly, which is currently in session, in addition to letting public school teachers vent their anger, has also listed Shenyang's "seven chaos," one of which is "traffic chaos." The Municipal Bureau of Public Works has paved the half of the gravel road leading from the station into the city with asphalt, and public buses and trams have also come out to embellish things, but the traffic is still a bit "chaotic." Military vehicles are partly responsible for the chaos. Every so often, they either smash a horse-drawn carriage beyond recognition or flip a rickshaw over. Their driving speed is so high that even traffic police with vigilant eyes sometimes don't have time to direct them. Public vehicles, especially trams, are too few. You can wait at a stop for half an hour and not necessarily get on. Following the appearance of public vehicles, there are a few more empty rickshaws and horse-drawn carriages on the roads, but they have still not lost their importance.</p>
<p>Haruhimachi—the Japanese street that used to be so crowded that it was impassable—was once deserted after the Japanese expatriates left. Now, it is no longer deserted. Replacing the former Japanese expatriates, our compatriots are setting up densely packed stalls of used goods there. Woolens, furs, civilian goods, and military goods are piled high. Prices are several times to dozens of times higher than they were a few months ago. Still, there are buyers. People will not completely forget the lessons learned in many ways. Escaping the noisy city, taking a car or walking to the suburbs for a stroll makes one feel much more relaxed and happy. Although, in the suburbs, you also see many underage young people or old people with stooped backs carrying heavy bundles of firewood, one after another, trudging from the distant countryside towards Shenyang, further increasing the desolation of the late autumn wilderness.</p>
<p>In the Suburbs - Both the Northern and Eastern Mausoleums</p>
<p>The Northern and Eastern Mausoleums in the suburbs are somewhat like the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum and the Ming Xiaoling Mausoleum in Nanjing. People who come to Shenyang always want to see them. The road to the Northern Mausoleum is closer. Taking a car from the city takes only ten minutes to reach. Because it's late autumn! There are few people around. Except for the three or so photographers taking quick photos in front of the gate and those selling fruit, there is a sense of being able to catch sparrows in the doorway after walking in. Even though the entrance ticket is only two yuan! The central avenue leading to the stele and the sacrificial hall is wide, flat, and still clean. The densely packed pines and cypresses standing on both sides of the avenue are dark green and black. Seeing them makes people yearn and feel emotional, but it also makes people feel empty. The stele engraved with Han and Manchu commemorative texts is tall and black. If someone hadn't smeared some white powder on it, it would be difficult to see even half a word. No one knows that the Qing Taizong is lying in the walled tomb a hundred paces away from the stele.</p>
<p>The road to the Eastern Mausoleum is even farther than the road to the Northern Mausoleum. Taking a jeep from the city takes at least thirty minutes. The Eastern Mausoleum is where the Qing Taizu's tomb is located. The architectural style is the same as the Northern Mausoleum, so the Northern Mausoleum should have been built to imitate the Eastern Mausoleum. It is surrounded by city walls, and outside the city walls are gloomy cypresses. Climbing to the third floor of the sacrificial hall, you can overlook the scenery of the wilderness. The tomb is a three-zhang-high (approx. 10 meters) small mountain, and the top of the mountain is smeared with a layer of cement, but most of it has peeled off. The photographer said that in the past, neither the Eastern Mausoleum nor the Northern Mausoleum were allowed to be seen by people, only the Japanese were an exception.</p>
<p>Isn't there a housing shortage in Shenyang? But in the near suburbs, you still see empty houses everywhere. Although these houses are so damaged that only the empty shell or only the four walls remain, they could still be useful if they were repaired.</p>

<h3>Thoughts After Returning From the Book Market</h3>
<p>— Tong Xian</p>
<p>Every time I go to bookstores, I always go with excitement and return with disappointment. In a nutshell, we only feel the poverty of the Chinese cultural world. Regarding books on current affairs, we know that authors cannot break away from their personal positions, but most of what we see is propaganda that is too strong, some bordering on abuse, lacking the demeanor of a current affairs commentator. Regarding scientific books, it is truly like finding gold in the sand, not easy to find a few. Even if there are a few, they are outdated. As for reports of one's own discoveries or experiments, we have not seen any. Regarding academic research and writings, there are said to be no creative masterpieces. It is not even easy to find a systematic work. Several academic elders have only published a few collections, compiling and publishing many scattered pieces of writing that have been written over time. Rising stars who have a complete set of research have not yet emerged.</p>
<p>This proves that in the past eight years of the War of Resistance, scholars, due to the difficulties of life and the instability of the environment, were unable to engage in systematic research. Mr. Hu Shi said that the level of students in Beiping was three years lower than before the war. I think that we people who do academic research are also three years behind. Perhaps even more than that. This is our spiritual loss in the War of Resistance. Others cannot compensate us for it. We need to make up for it ourselves. The academic atmosphere is very thin everywhere. We only hope that people who research academia can calm down and devote themselves to writing, so that they can relight the already dim cultural brilliance, and that we can see a few great works in the bookstores.</p>
<h3>"Social Thought"</h3>
<p>— Jun Zhi</p>
<p>Author: Sun Benwen Publisher: The Commercial Press</p>
<p>We live in today, and yet there are still people who are developing and thriving on the decadent academic theories that should have been "abandoned." Young friends who do not recognize them, if they accept these theories, will be "poisoned" by them and will even drag this advancing era backward.</p>
<p>This can be said to be a major crisis!</p>
<p>Indeed, the times are constantly developing. In this process of development, the growth of new ideas and the "abandonment" of old consciousness are constantly circulating. People always push new developments by following new growth! To make the world tend toward a prosperous path. However, in our country, this crisis is hidden. New ideas cannot be adopted, and old corruption is expanding, growing longer than before. In another ten or twenty years, I don't know what kind of China it will become? Only "thought" can control an entire person. Once thought is "poisoned," one's actions will inevitably be so. Therefore, to rescue this crisis, we must first give people correct thoughts and use these correct thoughts to transform a new and forward-looking society. The current academic community in China is carrying this great mission!</p>
<p>Youth's Recognition</p>
<p>The vast youth population, due to the circumstances, has developed petty-bourgeois habits. Other than their homework, they waste their time on movies and literary novels. Of course, this is not necessarily a bad thing, but you cannot gain a recognition of society. Although there are also literary works on revolutionary careers such as "Iron Flood" and "How Steel Was Tempered," if you do not know the historical background and the source of academic thoughts at the time, then even if you read the above-mentioned literature, you still cannot understand what is going on in this era? Then, you will still have no recognition of "society."</p>
<p>Based on the above, we feel that it is necessary to have a recognition of society, and it is necessary to advance thought. Therefore, it is even more necessary to read some books on correct academics. According to a statistic from a professor teaching at a university, only two or three out of every hundred Chinese college students pay attention to academic thought. Judging from this, the backwardness of Chinese society is a matter of course.</p>
<p>Young friends! We will never be content to fall behind. Now, let's all read some academic books and recognize this world.</p>
<p>This unavoidable digression must stop here. Now I would like to introduce an easy-to-read book to you - "Social Thought." In this book, the origins and content of many Western social thoughts are discussed concisely and clearly, from Plato and Aristotle to Marx and Comte. It expounds the main points of the ideas of various European and American thinkers, and also talks about the correctness and errors of the theories of each. We can know its outline, and we don't necessarily accept its conclusions. After reading it, we can have an image of each family's thought. From this image, we can then do further research—individual research of each family. From this, we can obtain recognition of each era and use our own pure academic and objective viewpoints to research and obtain correct recognition of each family. Here, I will briefly analyze and review this book:</p>
<p>The Legacy of Antiquity</p>
<p>Plato, we know that he was a famous Greek philosopher (487-347 BC). He once studied under Socrates. His knowledge was mainly based on "justice." The book briefly mentions his life and thought. The work "The Republic" can express his ideal society. In addition to Plato, there are Aristotle, the Stoics, and the Epicureans. Aristotle's philosophy is that society is produced naturally; the Stoics believe that it is produced by "unified consciousness," and the Epicureans believe that it is produced by self-interest.</p>
<p>Roman ancient philosophy is different from Greek philosophy. Due to convenient transportation, the country is more unified. Polybius valued cause and effect and advocated the theory of political cycles; Cicero believed that people have social instincts; Seneca advocated that society originated from the fall of human nature. As for the social thought of Jesus and the Christian religion, the above five families cannot be suitable for today's society.</p>
<p>After this ancient past, we entered the Middle Ages. Aquinas's "Summa Theologica" and Dante's "Divine Comedy" were both deeply influenced by religion. Dante's praise of imperialism and singing of utopian peace, with one person dictating the world; although he created the law of peace, it is still difficult to see in practice today.</p>
<p>Since the end of the Middle Ages, the situation has changed to the early modern period. Royal power was abolished, and various countries were also moving towards freedom and peace. From this time on, it was a new departure from the old and corrupt past. Machiavelli of Italy regarded political immorality as patriotism, that is, implementing harsh policies to treat the people. This kind of thought was realized in defeated Japan. Luther's "Theory of Obedience" and Calvin's "Institutes of the Christian Religion" are both backward thoughts. Bodin can be compared to Aristotle, and his academic theories are very compatible.</p>
<p>During the 15th and 16th centuries, under the autocratic and fatuous politics of the English king, Thomas More's two-volume "Utopia" appeared, criticizing the society at that time and expressing the state of contemporary society. Following him, there were also many "Utopian" thinkers. In the 17th century, there were the Englishman Hobbes's "Leviathan" and "The Laws of Nature and Nations"; Locke's "An Essay Concerning Human Understanding," and Rousseau's "The Social Contract"; these three men represented the social thoughts of that era. At the same time, Montesquieu of France's "Separation of Powers" explained the requirements of the time. By 1747, Turgot had written "Reflections on the Formation and the Distribution of Riches," and some say it was the precursor to "The Wealth of Nations." Before Turgot, Bacon, Descartes, and Montaigne had all stood on the path of "progress."</p>
<p>Hume was famous as a skeptic. Voltaire and Condorcet were both reformers during the French Revolution, but they trusted the power of subjective science too much. At the same time, in Germany, Fichte and Hegel's subjective idealism was changed to objective idealism, which was also adopted by the people at that time.</p>
<p>Adam Smith's "The Wealth of Nations" in naturalism was a contribution to economics; his social thought had a "laissez-faire" policy, which was also an original view for reducing oppression. Smith's friend Ferguson's social thought was also naturalist like Adam. He argued that people have a "motivation to move upward" and that the progress of society depends on the two factors of culture and psychology. At that time, their views were already rare. Later, there were also economists of the Adam Smith school such as Malthus. Malthus's thinking was even more advanced, with the "population theory." The origin of the increase and decrease of the population theory, placed in today, is of course no longer correct.</p>
<p>Saint-Simon used scientific methods to study social phenomena, or for the founding of Comte's sociology; before and after the founding of Comte's sociology, in the 19th century, social thought showed a tendency of "monism." Buckle used the role of the material environment to explain social phenomena, while Gobineau was the opposite of Buckle, believing that race is the main thing for the prosperity of a nation and culture; Chamberlain trusted talent.</p>
<p>The last two chapters discuss the social thoughts of Marx and Comte:</p>
<p>Regarding Marx, he is famous for his book "Capital." The achievements of this book are highly praised by both supporters and opponents of Marx's theories. This book briefly elaborates on Marx's historical background and the important theory of "historical materialism." The author pointed out various errors of Marx, but some of the arguments are subjective. This point needs to be changed to stand on an objective position.</p>
<p>As for Comte, he is an important figure in the ideological world. His contribution to sociology is very great. Everything about Comte is described in the most detail in the book, but because it is detailed, it is inevitable that there is too much praise. If we avoid this point, we can better understand Comte.</p>
<p>Above, I have briefly described the content of this book. Apart from some unavoidable minor errors, most of this book is worth adopting.</p>
<p>I said earlier that this book is easier to understand because the material is still rich. We can use this book as a starting point for studying social thought, and we don't necessarily have to fully accept its conclusions, but we can read its concise elaboration.</p>
<p>Young people! I hope that you will gradually develop correct thoughts.</p>
<h3>Publishing Industry News</h3>
<p>Robert Taylor's novel "Random Harvest," one of the bestsellers in the United States, has also been well received everywhere after being made into a movie, and it once caused a sensation in Shanghai. Now the novel has been translated by Lou Zizhen and Jin Canhe, and will be published serially in the semi-monthly magazine "Reader's Digest."</p>
<p>The editorial content of the "Seeing and Hearing Weekly" is extremely well-edited. The editors hope that the magazine will become "China's Time." It has now been published to Volume 1, Issue 13, and the content has not diminished in the slightest.</p>
<p>The "Youth Library" published by the China Cultural Service Society has been very popular among middle school and college students and young people in general since it was published. The Society has recently begun to compile and print a set of "University Libraries" and has hired more than 100 domestic scholars and experts as editorial board members. The upcoming new books of the two major libraries are listed as follows: The University Library includes Modern Monetary Theory by Wang Chuanzeng, Modern Banking Theory by Wang Chuanhui, and Principles of Family Law by Wu Qi.</p>
<h3>"A Cry in the Wilderness"</h3>
<p>— Xiao Hong</p>
<p>Aunt Xiao was a kind-hearted old woman, with no meanness in her heart and no curse on her lips. She chatted idly and casually, murmuring about the small things around her, ordinary and affectionate, simple and natural. Precisely because she was affectionate and natural, she used her resentments sparingly. Even her "Field of Life and Death," which carried the pain of national subjugation, was no different; it was as if an old man of seventy or eighty years was talking about the wars of his youth, bringing back memories of loved ones and cherished little objects that had been lost. He couldn't help but have a few tears of heartache in the corners of his eyes, letting them well up or fall—after all, the era was long ago, and the erosion of time had worn away the piercing pain and the grinding hatred. This is also the style of Xiao Hong's works.</p>
<p>Those mustard-seed-like little people, humble and insignificant, forgotten in the corners of the world, were each and every one mentioned by her, and each equally shared her deep and broad sympathy. There were no earth-shattering characters, no sensational stories; they were either common soldiers' helpers, boatmen, or farmers, or else kiln workers or washerwomen: these people had good hearts and hard lives, and each received her passionate love. In another work entitled "Hands," the daughter of a dyer went to school, and her classmates ridiculed her indigo-stained blue hands, disliked her, and distanced themselves from her; she felt the world was so cold that she had her father take her out of school with her luggage. The author worried with her, and wept with her. Did the author, feeling sympathy for her plight, turn around and complain about those who bullied her? No. To love beauty and hate ugliness is human nature, and the author did not feel that there was anything strange or hateful about them.</p>
<p>In her writing, one cannot find a single hateful character. Even the mother-in-law who tormented her adopted daughter-in-law to death, and the old widower who robbed graves for a living, were forgiven and excused by the author. When the young daughter-in-law was seriously ill, didn't her mother-in-law exhaust every method: folk remedies, wild medicines, welcoming gods and chasing away demons, consulting oracles, and spending over five thousand strings of cash, thereby crying herself blind in one eye? "Which family's adopted daughter-in-law doesn't suffer? ... Although I did beat her a bit too much, how else could I have disciplined her into a good person?" The old man by the lotus pond, whose son had died and whose daughter-in-law had remarried, didn't he try to learn to be a carpenter, even though he didn't know how to use his son's axe and saw? When he went out to rob graves in the middle of the night, didn't he hide it from his grandson, and when he thought of him possibly finding out, didn't he "feel great shame and immediately blush"? In the article "Disaster," He Nansheng, who told his students fine-sounding words about living and dying with the land, while packing up broken spittoons and empty cans to squeeze onto the train early, was treated in the most impolite way, but it was only a cold mockery, and it couldn't be called a heavy-handed condemnation. Throughout the entire work, there is not a single hateful character; what Xiao Hong portrays are poverty and ignorance. She does not denounce human nature, but complains about the system.</p>
<p>The characters are ordinary, and the plots are simple; to put it bluntly, most of the works have no story. Xiao Hong cannot be considered a novelist; she is an essayist. An old boatman warmly welcomes the X Road soldiers, and when he learns that the soldier is heading to his hometown, he asks him to take a message. ("Yellow River") A helper falls in love with the master's soldier and sends him off to fight, secretly wanting to save up her wages to arrange a future home. ("Vague Expectation") A village girl helps a Jiangnan evacuee wash clothes, and after losing this lucrative job, she still goes up the mountain to gather firewood. ("Under the Mountain") A young "red devil" is pushed into giving a speech but can't say a word, and bursts into tears in the laughter of the crowd. ("The Child's Speech") How intimately she knows the lives of those little people, how sympathetically she understands their joys and sorrows; even though they are insignificant little episodes, she picks them up casually, presses them down casually, talks about them murmuringly, and strums them lightly, like tuning a secluded piano string, singing out unmelodious, rambling notes.</p>
<p>On the literary labor, what identity does she present? —She is well-versed in the sufferings of the people, but does not wield the scalpel; like a kind-hearted and responsible nurse, Xiao Hong uses warm sympathy and gentle tones to comfort the souls of the suffering under her care with a spring breeze.</p>
<p>"Accepting fate passively, you say my life is a pity, but I myself don't care, you think it's very dangerous, but I think it's a source of pride. If not proud, what can I do? Life is more bitter than sweet." (Postscript to "Tales of Hulan River") This is Xiao Hong's self-analysis. She says that the character of "accepting fate passively" not only universally influenced—but also deeply permeated—the characters in the author's writing.</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Stories of Poets: Lu Fangweng and Tang Huixian</h3>
<p>— Tang Jingde</p>
<p>Lu Fangweng (named You, courtesy name Wu Guan, from Shanyin), the patriotic poet of the Song Dynasty, had one of the most heartbreaking events in his life, which he still remembered and could not forget even in his eighties. It was his beloved wife, Tang Huixian, who was not favored by his aunt and was forced to leave her husband's house. Tang was the daughter of Hong and was related to Fangweng through marriage. She was also able to write, but not as exquisitely as Li Qingzhao and Zhu Shuzhen.</p>
<p>After Tang was expelled by her aunt, Fangweng secretly rented a house for her outside and still secretly visited her. But the good times did not last long. One day, his mother accidentally found out, and after that, Lu You was monitored and cut off from Huixian, and no longer had the opportunity to visit her. As for Tang, she was young and had no one to rely on, so she had to remarry Cheng, a clansman from the same county (or Zhao, according to one version). At that time, Gu Weng was also matched by his mother and married on a selected date.</p>
<p>However, by chance, one day, Fangweng was bored and went for a walk in Shenmin Garden near Yuji Temple, and met Huixian and her husband. Fangweng was not convenient to greet her at the time, but Tang told Cheng, saying that he was her cousin. Cheng then set up a banquet to entertain Lu You, and Huixian also fulfilled the duty of a host, personally offering wine. Fangweng was overwhelmed with emotion and could not help but write a poem "Hairpin Phoenix" on the wall in the garden, which read:</p>
<p>Red crisp hands, yellow rice wine, the garden full of spring palace willow, the east wind is evil,</p>
<p>Feeling thin, a heart of sorrow, years of separation: wrong, wrong, wrong!</p>
<p>Spring is as old, people are thin, tear marks are red and wet with silk, peach blossoms fall,</p>
<p>Idle pond pavilion, mountain alliance is still, brocade book is difficult to entrust: do not, do not, do not!</p>
<p>Fangweng was only thirty-one years old at the time. The meaning of his poem is that the old events were triggered by Huixian's yellow wine, mentioning his mother's stubbornness, which caused his young couple to be separated. Although he regretted it, it was already too late. Tang saw the inscription and wrote a poem with him, (but this poem is quite suspected of being fabricated by later generations,) which reads:</p>
<p>Worldly feelings are thin, human feelings are evil, rain sends dusk and flowers are easy to fall, the evening wind dries,</p>
<p>Tear marks remain, wanting to write about the heart, talking alone leaning on the railing: difficult, difficult, difficult!</p>
<p>People become different, today is not yesterday, the sick soul is always like a swing rope, the horn sound is cold,</p>
<p>The night is late, afraid of people asking, swallowing tears and pretending to be happy: hide, hide, hide!</p>
<p>Later, after thirty-seven years, Fangweng was already an old man of sixty-eight years old. One day, he went to Shen Garden again. The owner of the garden had changed, and Tang was no longer in the world. He wrote another poem "Visiting Shen Garden," which said:</p>
<p>Maple leaves are beginning to turn red, oak leaves are yellow, Heyang's sad temples are afraid of new frost, (Pan Yue once served as the magistrate of Heyang, and began to see white hair at the age of thirty-two, white hair refers to white hair.)</p>
<p>The forest pavilion feels old and empty, who can tell the broken heart on the spring road,</p>
<p>The wall remains covered in dust, the broken clouds and dreams are vast,</p>
<p>Over the years, delusional thoughts have been eliminated, returning to the futon with a stick of incense.</p>
<p>Seven years passed again. He was seventy-five years old. One day, he revisited Shen Garden and wrote two more poems:</p>
<p>The dream broke and the fragrance disappeared for forty years, the old willows in Shen Garden do not fly with catkins,</p>
<p>This body will be made into Kuaiji mountain soil, still mourn the relics with a sigh.</p>
<p>Also</p>
<p>The setting sun on the city wall mourns the horn, Shen Garden has no old pool,</p>
<p>The spring waves under the heartbreaking bridge are green, once a startling goose reflected its shadow. (Startling goose—Luoshen Fu has a phrase "Ruo Jinghong", which is used as a metaphor for his wife Tang.)</p>
<p>After another six years, he was old and was already an old man of eighty-one years old. However, he was still affectionate. One evening at the end of the year, he had a dream, dreaming of everything in Shen Garden, the plum blossoms were still there, but the beauty was gone. The "Hairpin Phoenix" poem written on the wall fifty years ago, I suppose, has also fallen off and blurred. His poem said:</p>
<p>I am afraid to walk on the red road south of the city, and I am even more saddened by Shen's family,</p>
<p>The fragrance penetrates the sleeves of the plum blossoms, the green dips into the spring water of the temple bridge.</p>
<p>Also</p>
<p>I met spring again on the small path south of the city, but only saw plum blossoms and no people,</p>
<p>The jade bones have long been buried under the spring soil, and the ink marks still lock the dust on the wall.</p>
<h3>An Extra Chapter Outside the Deep Alley</h3>
<p>— Hu Mu</p>
<p>Deep Alley</p>
<p>That deep, deep alley, an alley that people cannot find their way through... I have come.</p>
<p>On a rainy night, I listened attentively to the raspy sound of the copper gong, a blind fortune teller, leading an eleven or twelve year old girl. That little girl did not have the white and tender skin of a noble lady, the wind and frost of life had made her suffer enough...</p>
<p>A few days ago, in this small alley, there was a wedding sedan chair drawn by horses. It seemed that another humble family was going to marry off their daughter, and another aristocratic young master was going to marry a "concubine"...</p>
<p>On rainy days, I am even more afraid to walk through this alley, because this alley is not only dark, but also very muddy... I only love that teahouse in the deep alley, where every day, many vagrants tell of the hardships of life.</p>
<p>I only love that family in the alley, they seem to be singing on the streets every day, a clapper, a fiddle, coupled with that raspy throat, arousing the joy of those poor people.</p>
<p>I love even more that bright little lamp in the deep alley, illuminating the path I trudge through in the dark night.</p>
<p>Record of Buying Water</p>
<p>In the early morning, when tufts of dawn clouds are rising in the sky, at this time the sky is about to radiate rays of golden light, the woman who buys water comes out, with disheveled hair, twisting waist, and drowsy eyes, blankly shooting out a tired divine light. At this time, the stove in the tea room is bustling. Besides the sparks crackling and jumping in the stone stove, the rest would be the tender voice of the woman buying water. "Boiled water, one kettle..." Listen, how beautiful, how elegant, how tactful this voice is!</p>
<p>And every woman who buys water, always puts on a red silk shirt, a fruit-green cloth or light blue trousers, and as a rule, wears a pair of wooden clogs (many women even wear big red satin slippers). When they go to buy water in groups, I know that their habit is on the one hand to save on firewood costs, and on the other hand to use this boiled water to cook rice. The girls who buy water are definitely not from wealthy merchants or noble families. On the contrary, they belong to a kind of poor class. Every day, I see them smiling at me with their teapots, and I understand the hardships of their lives...</p>
<p>So, on rainy streets, I prefer to sit in the teahouse, waiting for them, they like to hear me tell fables of the new era, but I need to hear their stories of life...</p>
<p>Interesting Anecdotes About Writers</p>
<h3>Andersen's Bedtime Curses</h3>
<p>— Shen Si</p>
<p>Hans Christian Andersen (1805-1875) was a famous Danish fairy tale writer. He was the most timid and suspicious. It is said that every day before going to bed, he had to throw a thick book under the bed and mutter: "Hey! Am I still afraid of you? You're here again! I knew long ago that you were hiding under the bed." He had to perform this set every day, because he was afraid that someone would hide under the bed and harm him after he fell asleep.</p>
<h3>Let Time Test Faith — French Writer Maurois's View on Peace —</h3>
<p>— Wang Rui</p>
<p>A few days ago, I was chatting with a young French officer. When the Nazi German army invaded Alsace and was about to occupy Strasbourg, he was stationed in Alsace. At that time, the situation was very serious, and the defense line could not be easily broken through.</p>
<p>"At that time, I was leading a hundred brothers," the young captain told me, "but I suddenly had a whimsical idea, I felt that to preserve Strasbourg depended entirely on our one hundred and one people. If we could hold our fan-shaped position, nothing could go wrong. Of course, the evolution of the situation at that time was not entirely like this..."</p>
<p>"However, later it turned out as we expected, all other fan-shaped positions had the same idea as us, and decided never to surrender and retreat; as a result, the Chen line was as solid as a rock, and the German army was never able to cross the thunder pool."</p>
<p>The situation we are in today is the same. If we do not want the peace defense line to be easily broken through, then each of us—men or women, young or old—must think like this: "It all depends on my determination, I should do my best to defend peace."</p>
<p>Faced with a peaceful world, a world of destruction, we must now choose. Because, if we cannot unite sincerely, then in the end we will inevitably be defeated one by one by the atomic bomb.</p>
<p>The current situation forces us to consider, what depends entirely on individual actions. If a unprecedented revolution does not occur in the hearts of mankind, this revolution will be of great benefit to the liberation of world peace. - Then all education will be in vain. We can and we must make the greatest efforts to defend culture. The foundation of peace, is not here, not there, but in the hearts of mankind. We must adhere to this faith between us. And the responsibility of you Americans is especially great, you must think about this repeatedly, and obtain a correct and appropriate conclusion, because you are one of the two strongest countries in the world today. My American friends, you should show to all other countries in the world that we can lay the foundation for peace from the fair resolution of economic problems, and the facts are waiting for you to make unremitting efforts.</p>
<p>Translator's note: Maurois is a famous French writer of today. During World War II, he could not bear Nazi oppression and fled to the United States. The above is a conversation between Maurois and American reporters when he recently left the United States to return to his French hometown.</p>
<h3>Cow</h3>
<p>— Wu Yunrui</p>
<h3>An Inch of Mountains and Rivers, an Inch of Blood 85</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>Fearing that the lights would sweep over and make it inconvenient to delay, I took a quick look, climbed down the stone wall, and followed Tiger Brother, drilling into the thickets. I gave a signal, and Tiger Brother responded from the edge of the thicket. This thicket was full of German holly, densely planted. It took a lot of effort to get through. At a glance, I saw that all the buildings were in the north, scattered in twos and threes, with few lights and not very bright, probably because important people had already left. The one in the middle seemed to be a three-dimensional building, in the form of a fortress, towering there darkly, very ferocious. This square was at least half a kilometer wide, paved with a mixture of sand and mud, the ground was yellow and black, as if uneven, but in fact it was very flat; all sides were surrounded by the same color holly, with only one entrance at each end in the far north.</p>
<p>The form of this restricted area was completely different from the sketches we had drafted, so the exploration work had to be started again. The first problem at the moment was to avoid the patrols. This area of thickets was of course a cover for carrying out work, but it could only cover human eyes and ears, but not the dog's sense of smell. On the surface, like the man and dog patrolling just now, there was only one person and one dog, and only two bullets were needed to settle the matter. But if the bullets could not hit, and did not hit a fatal place, once the alarm went out, we would be in a desperate situation. Moreover, this place was very quiet, and the sound of gunfire would be like reporting to the enemy ourselves, how could we mess around at will?</p>
<p>But after careful calculation, the patrol just now passed by at about half past seven, probably walking along the road, counting him half an hour, then he must have started from the departure point at seven o'clock, and walked here in half an hour. This patrol, according to the usual time limit, is either once an hour, or once every two hours. Looking at the calm situation today, maybe it's once every three hours, it's not impossible. Now, taking caution as the top priority, only count him as once an hour, then, there is at least forty minutes left, we can turn north again along this thicket to the east, and meander past.</p>
<p>Before, in Saizi, when I was fighting guerrillas with Tiger Brother, there were also several times when I scouted the enemy's camp with the sentries. The only difference was that although we two sneaked into the tiger's den, we had backup and were fearless. Here, there are only two of us, and the time and place are very different, so I ordered Tiger Brother to go first, and I followed his route at a distance of six or seven meters, so that no matter if there was an alarm in front or behind, we would have a little assistance from each other, and we could also restrain the enemy.</p>
<p>Following this thicket to the east, at the end, we turned and walked north. Under such action, we reached the enemy's building area safely. The problem now is to find out what these buildings are used for, and where most of the people are. To measure this first problem, we can only guess from the building form, and the second point can be based on the amount of light. The area where we are located is the left wing of the building, with a series of four four-story Western-style houses; each separated by two or three meters; it looks like the doors are facing south, and in terms of design, there is clumsiness hidden in the sturdiness; estimating down, they are probably offices and dormitories. A strange point is that no sound can be heard, and there are no posts. There is also an open space nearly thirty meters wide on the side.</p>
<p>Looking at the three-dimensional building in the middle, it is obvious that it is the main headquarters, with five floors, and the top seems to be a platform, with very powerful radio transmitting and receiving equipment. The west side, because the distance is too far, I can't see clearly, according to Tiger Brother, it looks like a warehouse, because the windows are round, small and few.</p>
<p>We observed for a while, and then in the darkness, we went around to the east side of the four buildings. As soon as we approached the corner, we faintly heard some voices and broadcast music from the far north; it turned out that behind these four clumsy buildings, there were rows and rows of many small houses, the voices and music were transmitted from there, and the lights were more and larger. Needless to say, that area must be the barracks. All the small teams of Japanese troops who had not yet been dispatched must be living there.</p>
<p>At this time, we carefully walked along the base of the wall, looking for cover, and attacking forward. When we reached the northeast corner of the first house, we leaned against the corner of the wall and stood.</p>
<p>"Little aunt," Tiger Brother pointed to the edge of the open space to the east and said, "should we run to that area of thickets, and follow the forest, close to the back?"</p>

<h3>Newsstands</h3>
<p>— Shaofu</p>
<p>For the sake of rectifying the city's appearance, there are really too many things that need to be done. For example, the traffic problem, although the authorities have made efforts for several months, has made a lot of progress. Frankly speaking, it is not up to standard. For example, the yellow stop lines at various intersections are neither universal, nor do they fade away after being painted for two or three weeks, and pedestrians and vehicles often exceed this line.</p>
<p>Now the authorities are coming to ban the newsstands in the central district. The congestion of the sidewalks and the obstruction of traffic by some newsstands are indeed facts, but we should also think about these small business operators. Not to mention the positive contribution they have made in promoting the circulation of books and publications and the dissemination of culture, some newsstands are not always obstructing traffic and damaging the city's appearance. Therefore, the authorities may designate certain areas to allow them to continue to set up stalls, or impose various restrictions and improvements on the existing situation. If this can be done, the newsstand vendors will certainly be happy to follow.</p>
<p>Newsstands are different from ordinary hawker stalls. Many vendors have received secondary education. They are forced by livelihood, and they cannot shoulder the burden of carrying baskets. Helpless, they scrape together and borrow a little capital to engage in this business that is close to poor scholars. Their situation is pitiful, and their behavior is also beneficial to society. Therefore, in the ban on street vendors, it is best to consider slightly, and it is not necessary to treat them all the same.</p>
<p>On the main streets of Europe and the United States, there are often newsstands dotted in between. It can be seen that the main reasons for the smooth and spectacular traffic and city appearance are elsewhere.</p>
<p>We absolutely support the authorities' painstaking efforts to plan for all aspects of the city, and their courage to go to work. We would like the authorities to be able to think carefully in all matters, and improve them step by step, so that they can get on track in a natural and gradual manner.</p>
<p>The Dark Side of Shanghai</p>
<h3>"Old Ghost" and "Old Old Ghost"</h3>
<p>— Wei</p>
<p>Yesterday at about ten o'clock in the evening, I took the Route 5 public bus from Caojiadu back to school. Probably because it was very late, there were very few people on the bus. There were only five or six people in the carriage. Across from me, there were two passengers wearing Chinese-style short shirts talking loudly. Because the voice was very loud, it attracted my attention.</p>
<p>The one sitting on the right, wearing a woolen hat crookedly, holding a half-smoked cigarette in his hand, was pouring out his triumphant experience—</p>
<p>"Haha, A ×, my father made an unexpected fortune last night, haha, it's simply an unexpected fortune!"</p>
<p>"How so?" His friend felt that it was necessary to hear it.</p>
<p>"Haha, last night, I came out of the old wine shop where you were, and on the way, two little ghosts (pronounced '　ju' in Shanghai dialect) suddenly popped out to borrow copper coins from me. Hey, I was just thinking about how to get rice for tomorrow! Hey, guess what I did, I told them: You two old ghosts are running into an old old ghost today!"</p>
<p>Just at this moment, two friends in suits turned around the corner. I thought to myself, what a great opportunity, so I said to them, "If you want to borrow copper coins, follow the old old ghost!" I waited for these two to approach, and patted them on the shoulder, "Hey! You two bosses, lend me some money to use." They paused for a moment, as if a little embarrassed. I also said to them, "Be nice, lend me some money, I'll spare your suits today, don't be ignorant." The two young men were quite nice, and they took out about a dozen ten thousand dollars in foreign currency. Haha... How about the old old ghost?"</p>
<p>Then there was a burst of laughter in the carriage. Five or six passengers and the conductor, Mr. ××, were all laughing heartily. His friend praised him repeatedly: "Unexpected fortune, unexpected fortune!"</p>
<p>Sitting in the corner of the carriage, I couldn't laugh, but couldn't help but feel a chill. I have been in Shanghai for a few months, and almost every day the newspapers have reported robbery cases, all kinds of robbery methods, all kinds of cases, which have really opened my eyes, who came from a small city; but like last night, doing robbery and singing it to people in the bus like a triumphant masterpiece, I couldn't help but be stunned, but what surprised me even more was that the two ×× also laughed indifferently as if they were listening to a joke, what is their responsibility, I am simply at a loss! Maybe it's because I don't understand Shanghai enough? Maybe I'm still too naive and overreacting? Didn't everyone in the car laugh it off? But I even thought that winter is coming soon, in Shanghai today, where people's livelihood is difficult, I have to worry about winter defense!</p>
<h3>"Be Smart - One of Us!"</h3>
<p>— Da</p>
<p>On a No. 8 trolley, a well-dressed passenger was pickpocketed, so the trolley stopped; several companions of this passenger helped him search, and they were all well-dressed individuals, with two even rolling up their white sleeves or holding toothpicks in their mouths.</p>
<p>Sure enough, a well-dressed man with gold teeth and a felt hat grabbed someone who was not so well-dressed and said:</p>
<p>"Be smart, hand it over."</p>
<p>The person who was grabbed blushed and struggled.</p>
<p>"We're all in this together, just say it, it's okay!" Two of the well-dressed men also went up and said to the red-faced person who was grabbed.</p>
<p>Seeing that things were not going well, the man could only blink his eyes and twist his mouth. Immediately, a uniformed, dignified doorman x dug out a large stack of banknotes from his pocket, red ones, flowered ones.</p>
<p>"Smack!" The doorman x was slapped across the mouth.</p>
<p>"Damn it! You're also in on it, I saw it coming." One of the well-dressed men said.</p>
<p>This man's face also turned red, and the five finger marks on his right forehead were even more visible.</p>
<p>"Drag him down! Drag him down!" Amidst a chorus of "drag him down," both men were dragged off the trolley. The pickpocket victim also got off the trolley, and the trolley continued on its way, leaving a large group of people on the side of the road.</p>
<p>"I never thought ×× would actually be an accomplice!" An middle-aged woman exclaimed.</p>
<p>"He was just scolding pickpockets as hateful, isn't he the very pickpocket who deserves to be killed?" A young man said.</p>
<p>"Look at him wearing a uniform, hey, damn it, I saw it coming a long time ago! Who do you think we are! He's really digging his own grave." One of the gentlemen who hit the doorman also spoke up; he didn't get off the trolley, and at this moment, he was still holding a toothpick in the right corner of his mouth.</p>
<p>Then the trolley car buzzed with chatter.</p>
<p>—This was many days ago; the day before yesterday, a friend came to tell me that he had been pickpocketed for 100,000 yuan on a bus. At the time, he was certain that someone dressed like an agency employee was the most suspicious, but he didn't dare to search him. (This is probably because my friend hasn't learned to say things like "Be smart, one of us!")</p>
<p>After this, I understood that in some situations, we should skillfully say a few phrases like "one of us," as this can often be much more advantageous. However, when you want to use the phrase "one of us," you must first consider whether you have learned to roll up your white sleeves or hold a toothpick in your mouth, etc. Otherwise, it will backfire. An experienced citizen certainly cannot fail to understand these things.</p>
<h3>### List of Students Studying Abroad</h3>
<p>— Yu Feng</p>
<p>The list of students admitted to study abroad has been published. I curiously read through the names of all the admitted students, and as a result, I discovered that many of the names of the admitted government-funded and self-funded students were the same. Not only were the strokes identical, but even the subjects they wanted to study were the same. This naturally cannot be a coincidence of people with the same name and surname, but rather that the students, after taking the government-funded exam, were afraid that they would not be admitted, so they took the self-funded exam as well, in order to leave themselves a backup plan, but who knew that they would be admitted to both.</p>
<p>I cannot criticize the few students who were admitted to both programs, but this occupies the places of others. For example, there were originally 148 government-funded places, but because one person took the exam twice and was admitted both times, the places of those with slightly lower scores who could have been admitted were taken away. How cruel this is to those who should have been admitted but were eliminated as a result!</p>
<p>And this also reduces the benefits to the entire country. If there should originally be 2,000 talented people returning to the country after studying abroad, then because one person takes up two places, the number is insufficient.</p>
<p>It is excusable for those taking the exam to have a mindset of seeking luck, but there are doubts about the method of publishing the exam list. I believe that those selecting people should examine the names selected to see if they took and were admitted to both exams, and then try to arrange things according to the situation, so as to avoid duplication. The list says there are 2,000 people, and I believe there should actually be 2,000 people going abroad to study.</p>
<h3>Paris Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Xie Ping</p>
<p>Young Woman · Prostitute</p>
<p>If you want to enjoy yourself, please go to Paris!</p>
<p>Think whatever you want! What do you want to use to enjoy yourself? In what way do you want to enjoy yourself? There will definitely be no shortage in Paris. Please rest assured.</p>
<p>Paris is a consumer of "hedonism." The people of Paris are all filled with dramatic, novelistic charm.</p>
<p>Here is a poem praising Paris:</p>
<p>"Then drink wine, don't forget pleasure, because what will happen tomorrow, what will happen in the future,</p>
<p>No one knows. Don't run, don't work hard;</p>
<p>Please drink as much as you like! Share! Eat! Think about the present!</p>
<p>It doesn't matter whether you live or not.</p>
<p>Life is all like this, only opportunity matters!</p>
<p>If you get it first, then it's yours;</p>
<p>If you die, it's all someone else's, you have no share!"</p>
<p>If you can understand this poem, then you truly understand Paris.</p>
<p>Some people say that this hedonistic view of life in Paris is wrong. So they placed the blame for the fall of Paris this time on "pleasure."</p>
<p>If that is really the case, then the Parisian view of life after the war should change somewhat!</p>
<p>Compared to pre-war Paris, our Shanghai is inferior in every way. Only in one thing is Shanghai more extravagant, more licentious, and more decadent than Paris! If Paris is a young woman just learning about romance, then Shanghai is an incorrigible prostitute.</p>
<p>Paris has learned its lesson, but Shanghai may not even get a chance to repent!</p>
