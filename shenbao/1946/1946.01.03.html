<h3>政府停戰建議中主張　推馬歇爾為調解人　協商會議會期十三日</h3>
<p>〔聯合社重慶一日電〕政府當局於除夕提出停戰建議，主張以美國駐華特使馬歇爾爲調解人，今日全國皆在翹企以待中共之答覆，大的須經延安中共執行委員會充分考慮後，方能訓令重慶中共代表提出覆文。無論其答覆是否贊同，政治協商會議則已定於一月十日開幕，由蔣主席親自主持，會期十三日。蔣主席於元旦廣播中已允儘量讓步，以謀國家和平，促進眞正民主。中共方面對於政府提議之惟一反應，即將其所提停戰建議原文發表。中共前曾拒絕發表全文，僅向各報記者透露其條件大槪，今見政府已將其提議全文發表，故中共亦將其無條件停戰之提案原文公布。其內容如下：中共代表鑒於雙方在以前歷次談話中，未能成立協定停止內戰，故於此次談判開始時，即自動向政府提議三項無條件停止內戰辦法，以釋國內外人士殷切之關懷，及便利政治協商會議之進行。第一，雙方應下令全國所有軍隊，停止一切軍事衝突，各守原防。第二，一切有關內戰之問題，如受降，繳械，解散僞軍，停止利用敵偽，劃分各軍防區，恢復交通，軍隊運輸，及解放區收復區等問題，應在軍事衝突切實停止後，由和平協商方法解決。第二，爲保障第一項之實施及第二項之順利進行，應由各界人士組織視察團，派赴曾經發生內戰各區，實地調查，報告眞相與以公布。至於政府方面提案則爲：（一）停止國內各地一切軍事衝突，並恢復鐵路交通。（二）因國內軍事衝突及交通阻塞等事，與我國對盟邦所負有之受降及遺送敵俘等義務有關，所有與停止軍事衝突恢復鐵路交通及其他與受降有關事項，由政府派代表二人，中共派代表二人，會同馬歇爾將軍，從速商定辦法，提請政府實施。（三）由國民參政會駐會委員會推定公正人士五人，組織軍事考察團，分赴全國發生衝突區域，考察軍事狀况，交通情形，以及其他與國內和平恢復有關事項，隨時將事實眞相提出報告並公布。政治協商會議成立時，亦請其推定公正人士參加。</p>
<h3>國民大會籌備會　政府選任委員七人至九人</h3>
<p>〔合衆社重慶二日電〕中國步入一九四六年，充滿和平之希望，一方面政府提出反建議，由國共雙方各推代表，與馬歇爾特使商談停戰步驟；他方面南滿國軍綢續推進，已收復阜新，新民，營口，朝陽等地。政府之建議，係答復共產黨所提立即無條件停戰之建議者，要求恢復鐵路交通，並由國民參政會（非政治協商會譏）常務委員會中之中立觀察家五人，前往視察衝突區域。同時政府已命令組織定於五月五日開會之國民大會籌備委員會，委員人數自七人至九人，均由政府選任。</p>
<p>〔聯合社重慶一日電〕美國駐華特使爲歇爾，今日與中共代表周恩來會談兩小時，由種種徵象觀之，馬歇爾將任中國內爭調解人。馬氏談話內容如何，左右未加披露，但知其所談範團甚廣，中共提議雙方無條件停戰一事亦在其內。中共前已將該黨主張向馬歇爾提出，惟今日之談話極其詳盡，尚係初次，足徵中共亦願接受馬使爲國共間調解人。據馬使屬員表示，中共若允接受中央關於無條件停戰之對案，則馬使亦願以調人自任。馬使於中共未答覆政府和平提議之前，自不能宣布其立塲，但可假定政府事先曾與馬使商議。</p>
<p>〔合衆社紐的一日電〕紐的太陽報昨日載稱：馬歇爾將軍之駐華特使任務已「順利開始」，「共黨所提條件雖未公佈，但中國共產黨已用書面建議全國立即無條件停戰之報告，實爲來自重慶之好消息。國民黨發言人常以共黨難以信頓表示不滿，謂一項建議甫經接受考慮，往往重提新議，另生枝節，今旣筆之於書，當不致再如以往之出爾反爾矣。共產黨之轉變或因蘇聯似已決意與其他盟國採取一致步驟，以支持蔣委員長所致。但謂共黨之隨機應變，由於馬歇爾將軍威力施展之神速使然，似更爲恰當。馬特使於初履中國國土時，即已明白表示美國在華主要目的，為促進全國團結，渠紙華後，立即與各黨派領袖從長計議，並使各黨派代表會合商談。該報謂終止內戰之努力，往往已露解決端倪，卒因某一方面之固執而告破裂。該報最後提出警告稱：此抓情形或不免再度發生。</p>
<h3>何應欽將軍　即視察各地</h3>
<p>白崇禧今日飛京</p>
<p>〔本報南京二日電〕聯合國軍事會議，本月中旬即將在英倫開幕，我國代表參謀總長何應欽將軍，以　國在即，行前決先飛赴各地視察，然後啓程與會，副參謀總長白崇禧將軍定三日偕次長劉斐飛京。</p>
<h3>宋院長在平　勗勉國人</h3>
<p>〔中央社北平二日電〕宋院長元旦在平演說，勗勉國人一致努力，對內力謀恢復交通，穩定物價，對外確定匯率，發展國際貿易。又宋院長二日午宴請全體在平參政員，聽取對目前北方各問題意見，宋院長表示，願於短期內謀求解決方策。</p>
<h3>陪都市民簽名　彙呈主席致敬</h3>
<p>〔中央社重慶二日電〕陪都市民以蔣主席領導抗戰，完成和平，値茲中華民國卅五年開國紀念，特聯合簽名致敬。所備之名册俱極精緻，並綴以頌詞，彙計此種簽名册，共得百餘本，參加簽名者共十餘萬人，業由各民衆團體推派代表送請國府參軍處轉呈。</p>
<h3>蔣經國訪蘇任務　交換中蘇合作一般意見　外記者招待會席上吳部長寒宣布</h3>
<p>〔中央社重慶二日電〕外記者招待會，二日午後三時舉行，由吳部長國楨，劉次長錯及張參事平羣主持，茲錄主要答問如次：某記者問蔣經國訪蘇之任務爲何？答：蔣經國訪蘇，爲蔣主席私人代表，對中蘇合作，作一般意見的交換。記者問，共產黨對政府於除夕所提出停止衝突三項方案之反應如何？答：政府尚在等待共產黨方面之答覆中。問，年前河南黃河汜區界場，在太康被掘決口，汜濫損失情形如何？答，據行政院所得該省七區軍員報告，共軍企圖於去年十月三日，在白潭以北將河堤掘放，汜濫地區約長一百二十里，寬三里，淹沒田地的二百萬畝，財產損失共計有一億三千六百萬元。問·政府各部何時始能全部遷京？答·目前運輸工具，首靠飛機，故運量有限，來春江水提高，大船可駛，三·四月間可望中央全部公務人員在京辦公。</p>
<p>社論</p>
<h3>印度尼西亞的新生</h3>
<p>荷印的局勢自敵寇投降以來，一直動盪不定。民族主義運動中的若干激烈分子，在民族自主獨立運動中，不僅具有反荷的情緒，且更難免有濃厚的排外行動；所以一時關於荷印方面的局勢似頗混沌。三實　泗水等大埠的秩序也相當混亂，以致在荷印方面担負日軍受降工作的英軍，也不得不採取斷然行動。這種局勢若讓它發展下去，對於東亞和平的重建很有影響。中國人民之留居在荷印者，爲數也相當可觀；對於荷印局勢的發展，我們自也不能不表關切。日昨倫敦電訊，謂英荷對荷印政策已成立協議，荷蘭對荷印政策已加修改，繼三强外長會議之後，遠東局勢又有新的曙光，實足令人欣慰。</p>
<p>荷蘭東印度副總餐范穆克自飛歐以後，一般都希望對荷印局勢的解次可以獲致適當的途徑。一昨唐寗街十號所發出的公報，謂英國政府對其盟邦荷蘭重申其所負之義務，乃在迅速建立安全條件，使荷蘭東印度政府得與印度尼西亞代表麻續進行談判。同時，荷蘭總理施美爾麥洪教授與英首相阿特里近日來所進行之談判，亦已結束，並成立協議。英國聲明一旦英軍在爪味完遂其日軍繳械，及解放戰俘的任務，當立即撤離。兩國政府又認爲政治衝突的解次爲完遂盟國最高統帥加予英國的任務中之一種主要的貢獻；而此項任務，即在淸除這些區域內的日軍，是爲英荷及印度尼西亞人民三方有關的事。</p>
<p>在英荷對於爪哇政策成立協議的時候，據傳，荷印政府亦已修改其對於爪哇之政策。荷印副總督范穆克在對倫敦記者談話席上，曾言十一月中彼與印度尼西亞人代表所提之條件現已修改，深信印度尼西亞人對此必當可能接受。至於此新的政策爲何，范穆克迄未吐露；但據有資格的觀察家，則謂此新政策將包括予東印度人民以一種新的憲法，使東印度各島能聯合一致，取得一種如加拿大和澳大利亞那樣的地位，而與荷蘭相聯。這就是一種「陶米寗」制度，在對內甚至對外的事務上可以完全獨立自主；但對於國防軍事上，却須與荷蘭聯合一起。這制度能吾爲印度尼西亞人所接受，目今自不可知；但此項建議的提出，無疑地，爲向解決荷印局勢的一種良好步驟。</p>
<p>原來荷印局勢之所以惡化，不免由於一般激烈分子，中了「大東亞」欺騙宣傳的毒素。一部在日寇統治下與日人提携合作的印度尼西亞人，因日寇投降，受了日軍的煽動與支持，取得了日軍的裝備，接受了日軍的訓練，從而樹起民族運動的旗幟。這一運動的開始，與其說是在謀印度尼西亞人的獨立自主，母寗是在掩飾他們過去與日人合作的罪行。在領導這一運動的人，他們所希望的尚然在博取世界的同情而給予他們以支持。但世，與論對於他們却不會作有力的聲援。中國自身努力於民族解放運動者垂五十年，對於被統治民族的解放運動，不特有道義上的同情，而且在可能範圍內儘量予以支持。開羅會讓的昭告，對朝鮮民族運動的支持，就可以看出我們對被統治民族解放運動的態度。印度尼西亞人的民族運動，如果眞是一種自發的解放運動，中國人民在道義上自當予以支持。在印度尼西亞民族運動中一宗可喜的跡象，是中正分子的逐漸抬頭，「大東亞」的毒素可以有日趨廓淸的希望。</p>
<p>這是在這種形勢下，我們看見有英荷兩國關於爪哇政策的協議，有荷蘭政策的修改。荷蘭的新政策究竟如何雖有待於證實，但電傳若果可靠，不得不認爲相當寬大與明智。荷蘭之與東印度已接着三百餘年的悠深歷史關係，近年來，荷人對於東印度的統治，比較地也相當開明。「陶米寗」制度若果被提出，一方面固可以滿足印度尼西亞人民族自主的願望，一方面使三百年來荷蘭與東印度的歷史關係不致毀棄，實在也是一種最理想的解次途徑。印度尼西亞乃由散布在東南太平洋無數的島嶼而成，荷蘭過去的統治多少維繫了印度尼西亞的統一性。現在是原子能的時代，國際形勢還有待於進一步的調整。荷印副總督范穆克本身就是印度尼西亞人，對於印度尼西亞人的願望，自極明瞭；此番自歐東歸，帶來了新方案，相信與印度尼西亞領袖可能有圓滿的談判，進而成立協議。東南亞的和平，印度尼西亞的新生，全繫乎此。</p>
<h3>故都新歲充滿喜悅　不平之氣發洩無餘</h3>
<p>〔本報北平一日電〕舊都新歲降臨在淡淡的喜悅裏，雖然，街上除了飄揚的全是嶄新國旗和些彩牌坊，以及空中若斷若續的爆竹聲，好像沒有熱關氣象，但是宋院長把已經決定的郵電加價取消　已給瘋在的物價潑了一頭冷水，使生活重壓下的人們鬆了口氣，來迎接新年。工廠復工辦法的擬訂，也使在勝利中失業的工人看見曙光一錢。這幾天冷的很，街頭屋頂到處都有積雪，馬路冰凍得滑溜溜的幸而救濟總署麵粉到得正是時候，貧寒的孩子，也可一啖美國麵粉了。從今晨零時起，車輛一律靠右邊走了，到現在下午八時，還沒有聽說有什麽不幸事件，許多走到左邊的汽車，都被對面急駛而來的車輛提醒了。全市放假一日，淸淡的電影院。飯館。都擴了起來，北海的滑冰塲上，也更多添了紅紅緣緣的靑男少女。只有敵僞產業處理處最忙，因為要在幾天之內理好三月以來的一團亂絲，救濟總署也照常辦公，因為多少貧血的　向他們伸了出來。</p>
<p>慰問淸寒敎師</p>
<p>貧苦淸高的人師，還沒被人忘記，敎部督導專員張鴻潔，今天預備去按門慰問，並送去一袋美國麵粉，臨時大學補習班的學生，今天每人發菜金法幣五十元，據說可以嘗嘗肉了。幾個大報紙今天報加了一倍，華北日報社論迎接第一個和平平文中，籲請一切大國的政治家，對於全世界的人類幸福，共同具有責任感，並且說，今後最能享受人類的崇拜者，將是具有世界抱負的政治家，不再是寄自己國家的安全繁榮於下世國家的恐怖與匱乏的英雄。益世報的我們的新期待社論中，指卅五年爲中國之命運年，並且大盤的疾呼，民衆生活需要安定，今年再有顚沛流離，便是卅五年的奇恥大辱，再有人放一聲槍，便是時代的罪人，再有人貪汚，不配在三十五年活下去。成舍我在世界日報親自疊了一篇大文章，要求政府人民人人守法，了事，盡責，報紙上要人應景的文章有幾篇，但是引人注意的倒是新聞欄裏一段張繼除夕對靑年團的訓話，他以建造房屋用多個意見的工程師結果必失敗為例，說明在復員建國中一黨執政仍有必要。</p>

<p>〔本報揚州二日電〕進入蘇北之精銳國軍，正源源向泰縣增援，前鋒昨日已越過宜陵，共軍侵人揚泰公路重點之宜陵，未及二十四小時，即爲少數之國軍逐退。該地共軍雖有增援模樣，但因交通條件不够，時間上業告失敗，而在揚泰公路兩側三十里以內，不出三日，恐亦無共軍立足之隙地。湯恩伯司令管來此視察時，在各界歡迎會席上，曾以極坦率誠懇之態度，告慰蘇北父老謂蘇北將重見天日，人心益安，十日前之緊張局勢，曾使揚州米價高至每石法幣二萬元，鄉間尤貴，近已回跌至一萬六千元。</p>
<p>〔本報南京二日電〕載至本日止，蘇北共軍費時兩週，傾二十團以上之兵力，爭奪高郵，圍攻泰縣，威脅楊鎭，其所得戰果，則不勝悽慘。現邵伯·高郵已重爲國軍掌握，除夕晚迄元旦日侵晨，共軍粟裕曾以四團兵力，由西南兩面猛攻泰縣縣城，經守城部隊及刁家舖側面之國軍，奮勇擊退，此為泰縣彼團後，共軍展開猛烈攻勢之第十次，十盪十決，終未得逞。據深明荕北地理與夫共軍之組織及其寶力者談，蘇北共軍裏脅有餘，戰志不足，如不適時停戰，撤退鹽阜，終必慘敗，其故有三：（一）蘇北運河兩岸，地多平原，泰縣城外，高地甚鮮，且無高大堅固之建築物，不利游擊戰，國軍據城而守，扼河以防，共軍須步步仰攻，故國軍常能以少數守軍，擊退多數之共軍。（二）國軍中多湖湘子弟，齊魯健兒，若輩血戰經年，飽嘗敎訓，今茲幸覩日寇屈膝，河山重光，正慶解甲有日，還鄕可期，豈意禍起蕭牆，共軍忽然倡亂，因之悲憤塡膺，戰志彌旺。返觀共軍在江北裹運河各縣，裹脅而來之農民，則大多爲安土重遷，樂耕厭兵之鄉愿，蘇北農村敎育向稱落後，晨民曾受中等敎育者，爲數極少，彼等易脅而難敎，但對言忠信，行篤敬之知識份子，則信仰無差，而奉爲神聖，今見共軍倡徵兵則强拉硬扯，減賦稅則變爲勒索，甚且爲便利搜刮計，不惜破壞國家幣制，發行抗幣及一文不値之流通券，造成空爾倉麋，盛爾家室，驅爾於溝壑，而美其名曰「解放」。蘇北之晨民雖愚，但對「解放」二字之眞義，婦孺亦不可欺，無怪以烏合之衆，一經接觸，便作鳥獸散。（三）蘇北共軍在地利上之最大缺憾，亦同於其他各地，即有可脅之民，無可用之兵，共黨似已有慘痛之經騐。當日寇投降以前，共黨在蘇北之做法，爲政治採攻勢，軍事採守勢，故九月以前共軍運用抗幣，吸收物資，尚取謹愼之態度，其用意顯在以經濟柔術，神化其政治騙術，藉之穏固其在蘇北佔領區內之統治，然人民已痛苦不堪，今則不然，自九月初，共黨這變動蘇北攻勢，進窺揚泰，擴大其鹽阜根據地　外國，思與政府軍劃江爲界，永固其蘇北統治權，已重步僞政府後塵，濫發流通券，強迫人民使用，共軍往日所資為宣傳，所謂不濫發鈔票者，不啻自　其頰。基上三因，來日共軍在蘇北之失敗當爲軍事，政治，經濟，全盤之失敗，自無疑問。</p>

<h3>英美作外交活動　防止蘇伊危機　使聯合國後構不致受影響</h3>
<p>〔合聚社倫敦二日電〕英美兩國今日正努力從事外交活動，俾防止蘇伊危機。在下星期舉行之聨合國大會中，成爲一重大問題。倫敦報紙載來自德黑蘭之外交報告，暗示伊朗內閣在數日內或將發生第三次辭職，以及英美駐伊大使經一天之努力活動後，伊朗政府有改組可能。聯合國機構官吏切盼第一次大會不爲內部之陰　所　罩，並欲保持（第一次會歲之力量，以建立安全組織。莫斯科會　之未能解決伊朗危機，使英美方面不得不從事外交活動，因伊朗政府官吏刻正以向聯合國大會提出此項問題相威脅。</p>
<p>〔合衆社會敦一日電〕今日所透露消息謂：蘇聯外委長莫洛托夫，將不赴本月在倫敦舉行之聯合國大會，已令伊朋與土耳其問題車日解決之希望大减。此間外交界人士原信「三强」外長均將赴會，乘此機會作非正式之討論，即不致有確定之行動，亦可謀解決各項問題之方策。英國深恐伊朗北部之變亂及蘇聯對土耳其之要求。將造成整個中東政治穩定之威脅。</p>
<p>伊朗政府　料將整個改觀</p>
<p>〔路透社德黑蘭二日電〕伊朗交通大臣費羅資　昨日辭職，觀察家相信此乃伊朗將遇最後危局，而政府整個改觀之先聲，與政府有密切關係之若干人士，今料首相哈基米亦將辭職，並認英美大使加緊外交活動，乃「重要發展」之徵象，一般人預料中之一種發展厥為伊朗政策將轉而向左，惟迄今尙無伊政府與蘇軍局直接談話之表示。伊朗某著名識員昨晨聲稱：「吾人已知布拉特爵士携有莫斯科會議後政伊政府之重要牒文，且美大使亦已從美國務　貝爾納斯接獲關於伊朗之新訓令」。布拉特乃英國駐伊大使，在莫斯科出席外長會議後，昨日飛抵德黑蘭，雖値元旦假日，仍於返任後立刻召集大使館員，並與美大使茂萊會商，旋於昨日午後訪會伊朗首相，據茂萊稱：渠於昨晨晤伊首相，午後可望由伊王特予接見。同時據莫斯科電台稱：伊朗國會副議長業已辭職，電台報告員未述該人之姓名。</p>
<p>對西班牙　英美與蘇一致</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓一日電〕今日據此間外交官員稱：美英兩國將於今年正式承認立陶宛拉特維亞及愛沙尼亞割歸蘇聯版圖。此外，美英蘇三强對於各項外交事件，將於本年內採取共同政策。此種推測如屬準確，則西班牙弗朗哥政府旣未獲蘇聯承認，美英亦將與之絕交。至於美英承認羅馬尼亞及保加利亞兩國政府，則早已在莫斯科會議決定。蓋二十一國和平大會之召集及五敵國和平條約之訂立，旣已完全商定，美英兩國自不願再因波羅的海及弗朗哥問題另生枝節，分散聯合國之團結。關於西班牙問題，美英法三國即將於本年初經由外交途徑或藉正式會議形式與弗朗哥討論，以便決定對於西班牙流亡政府之態度。美國若干官員相信，美英法三國今年同時與弗朗哥政府斷絕關係，頗有可能云。</p>

<h3>酷刑備嘗沉寃莫雪　楊文道的血淚史　重算中山秀案舊賬</h3>
<p>— 本報記者　平齋</p>
<p>楊文道是誰？</p>
<p>上海人素來健忘，提起楊文道，也許知道的人很少罷。十年前，楊文道三個字，曾經轟動全市全國的，他是中山秀雄國際大血案驚人新聞的中心人物！</p>
<p>上海人雖忘了楊文道，而楊文道却忘不了上海人—忘不了中山秀雄的大血案。十載鐵窗，這五十一歲的老犯人天天在死的陰影裏過生活。楊文道日夜在念着：「我是寃曲的！爲了國家，我坐牢獄，天有一日重光，我總得伸伸寃！」</p>
<p>虹口一帶如臨大敵</p>
<p>回返到十年之前，常民國二十四年十一月九日晚上九　十五分，在虹口竇樂安路二百零九號門口，突然有一個日本水兵中槍倒地。這個水兵的名字就呌中山秀雄。到午夜一點十五分，這個兵傷重不治，死在海軍醫院。</p>
<p>日本的海軍陸戰隊得信後，立刻派士兵百餘人，把守全虹口各要衝，鐵甲車滿街飛馳，車上的日本兵全副武裝，彷彿全虹口的中國老百姓，都是他們衝鋒的對手。</p>
<p>全虹口人心浮動，市民都大包小裹，紛紛向租界「逃難」。謠言說：「日本兵要衝進來了！」　那時候的形勢緊張到萬分，公安局，租界當局，及日領館懸巨賞緝凶。一共是一萬二千元的賞格，照當時的市價，足够買十二根金條。於是在二十五年四月二十一日，算是捉到了嫌疑犯。</p>
<p>找到線索搜出一書</p>
<p>破案的是日人平山，而這個平山元一却實在是一個入了日本籍的廣東人，花柳病醫生鄭惠民。</p>
<p>當時鄭惠民就去報告日本探長中村長雄說；「手槍係韓人傑克所有，當十一月九日深夜，傑克與『小廣東』等三人，在寶樂安路行走時，適與中山相值。比近豐樂里，傑克將手槍交與小廣東，乃將中山暗殺。」</p>
<p>「小廣東」的眞姓名是葉海生，是跳舞塲領班，曾在二十四年十二月帶了舞女到靑島去開維也納舞廳。捕房旣得踪跡，就派人到靑島，在二十五年四月中旬，把葉海生逮捕解到上海。葉是洪順會會員，而捕房却又說是找到了綫紫，在四月十九日，把洪順會的主席楊文道也加以逮捕。同時從楊的家裏，搜出了一本綠色封面的「實用物理學」，楊文道的命運，也就注定在這本書上。</p>
<p>自衛手槍早經交還</p>
<p>這本「物理學」裏曾經被挖空成手槍形，正好可以放一支手槍。楊文道說，他的那本書裏是放一支他的「蒂蒙」牌自衛槍的，不過那支槍早已交還捕房了。但是捕房裏把那支蒂蒙牌手槍吊出來，放進書裏的空洞時，竟再也放不下。他們再用打死中山秀雄的那支PB牌手槍放進去，却一拍即合，恰巧正好！</p>
<p>就因爲道些證據，捕房對葉楊二人提起公訴。</p>
<p>五月一日，上海特一法院刑一庭就開始審訊，葉海生承認目覩楊文道開槍。到五月六日，再開庭時，葉海生却又說，此事都是他一個人幹的，楊文道根本沒有去。</p>
<p>楊文道却說，那本「實用物理學」絕對不是他原有的那一本。他對於殺死中山秀雄的事完全不知。</p>
<p>但是當時的空氣却實在緊張。每逢審訊，旁聽席上總有許多日本水兵，帶着武器聽審。法院外面管探密佈，却這常常停着一部滿載武裝日兵的鐵甲車。</p>
<p>酷刑之下仍不屈服</p>
<p>檢察官張宗儒論告時，也說葉楊二人確係被寃，他說，殺了人豈有把藏凶器的書放在家裏的道理。而且那本書上指紋十四處，沒有一處是和葉楊一人的手指符合的。而且那個空洞四週的切縫極新。慷慨陳詞，聲淚俱下。葉海生自已本來都已全盤承認，到五月二十七日開庭時却痛哭失聲，說他在捕房裏，實在不堪受刑，不敢不招認。</p>
<p>楊文道是硬漢。他每天（！）給狄斯威路捕房的日本探捕上刑四小時，灌水，跪磚頭，踢，打，逼他承認。他的唯一回答，「你們先對我胸口打了三槍，再呌我承認罷。」日本人大怒，脫下皮鞋對他亂打，昏厥好幾次，始終沒有屈服。這種生活，他一連過了六個半月！</p>
<p>一直到二十五年十月二日，本案方才判決，葉海生楊文這都處死刑。</p>
<p>提起上訴判決駁回</p>
<p>十月十一日，葉楊都向高二分院提起上訴。高院開了一庭，就宣告辯論終結。判決上訴駁回。楊葉再向最高法院提起上訴。然而這已經是民國二十五年的十二月了。</p>
<p>二十六年，神聖的抗戰開始，一直到今天，最高法院還沒有判決這件案子。楊文道自從民國二十五年十月二日押到提籃橋上海監獄之後，一直關到了今天，他還在等候。葉海生却已經在四年前　斃獄中。</p>
<p>這判了死刑的罪犯，天天在等候。他默禱着：「天有一日重光，我總得伸伸寃！」</p>

<h3>投機對象之一　滿港幣動盪經過　照英美匯兌計算　價格較美鈔便宜</h3>
<p>港幣在上海一年來，亦成爲一般游資投機的對象，兎起罵落，漲跌時見，市面上通常分老貨及新貨兩種，老貨指一九三〇年或一九三〇年以前發行者，還有一種一九三五年版，則較三〇年的低十元左右，一百元以下的小票，則低一成左右，新貨則分一九三六及三七年版，惟一九三六年版號碼（2）字頭則與三七年同價，（號碼在C字一二六〇〇〇以後）還有一種一九三四年版百元票（號碼在B字四八五〇〇〇以後），五十元票（號碼在B字三五〇〇〇以後），亦與新貨同價，所謂新貨，即是指已被英政府宣佈作廢，而經將號碼公布者，其時市塲上，尚以僞中儲劵爲本位時期，新貨的市價自僞幣一萬六慘跌至二千以下，經營該業的小錢莊和一般持有人，莫不蒙受極大打擊，因爲錢兌業方面繼續吞吐，行情迄未中斷，隔了幾天遂有我國政府有向英政府交涉整理之傳說，吸動了一般暴利者，逢低又搨進，逐漸回昇至法幣喊價三十元以上，隨後又說該項廢幣，實爲日人爲償還匯豐存款而發行，無論如何，必有整理之希望，市價遂再拉上，入後港滬運輸恢復，粤澳港等地對新貨亦有老貨對對折之價，互相賣買之訊，一度漲到八十元以上，最近因爲港滬匯水祇八五折，該地新貨，曾退至三折以內，滬市亦步跌至四十五元左右，無如港票老貨，以匯水合算，始終在法幣二百五十元左右，海空兩路，仍在本埠搜買新貨運去，本埠存底，川流不息地陸續减少，前日新貨市價已回好至七十五元左右，聞粤港兩地新貨價有步漲至一百餘元之訊，近來匯水漸告軋平，趨勢行見再俏，一般穩健份子，鑒於新貨市價日昂，危險性亦逐步加重，近來頗多垂靑於老貨，因爲老貨爲合法之香港通貨，港幣一元法定可兌英鎊一先令三便士，如以英美匯兌計算，即等於美匯二角半，如以目下之美鈔比較，港幣實覺便宜得多，說不定不久的將來，游資有分散至港票的一天。</p>

<h3>如何處置刼餘紗布</h3>
<p>— 潘士浩</p>
<p>業之中心，國人自設之廠，會萃於是，外人來設之廠，亦以此爲基礎，故其紡織梁工廠，曁有關之商業，如紗業布業等，實占本市工商業之重心，自抗戰軍興，洋花之來源及色布之視口，同受阻礙，斯業自不免減色，然以大後方爭取物資之努力，及淪陷區民用之急迫，仍能維持相當繁榮，泊乎日軍進佔舊英法兩租界時，紗布存底之厚，示意應獻給若干部份，業中人以權益所繫，一方而虛與委蛇，一方面即暗襄加緊內移，以保存實力，敵日大恚，乃於民國卅二年八月九日，假手僞組織，頒發僞命，强迫收買，消息甫佈，四方震動，其稍有延遲，或稍有隱匿者，偵騎四出，急於星火，敵僞之憲兵及經濟保安隊，明刧暗榨，藉端騷擾，廠家工人及店家職員之因是失業者甚衆，據僞商統會結至九月六日止之統計，其强迫收去之紗布量爲</p>
<p>棉紗　九二、一〇三件</p>
<p>白坯布　一、四二〇、一六〇疋</p>
<p>加工布　五、〇二二、七二〇疋</p>
<p>其後又經搜括，積至</p>
<p>棉紗　九五、二五四件</p>
<p>白坯布　一、四四四、四〇〇疋</p>
<p>加工布　五、二七三、六八〇疋</p>
<p>開列棉紗，以每件可生產棉布四十疋計，可得布三，八一〇，一六〇疋，加上白布及加工布，總數當在一千萬疋以上，其後經保留紗布二九，八四九件，（布每件以四十疋計）並免除二六，七一二件，名爲保留生產事業，維持民用消耗，實則不過占總數十分之二，經其强迫收買以去者，蓋仍在八百萬疋左右，如以每人製新衣一身而言，足够供給五千萬人之服裝而有餘，當業損失之重，不言可喩，當是時染織廠業同業凡千餘家，棉布號同業約二千家，紗業同業亦千餘家，降至目前，據各該同業公會重行登記之會員名册，染織業五百餘家，棉布業的七百家，紗業不滿四百家，且多屬從有其名，無力營業，廠則軀穀僅存，店則存貨一空，甚矣國難中損害之巨也。（未完）</p>
<h3>高郵揚州一度恐慌　共軍騷擾蘇北　蘇省秘書長陳言報告</h3>
<p>蘇省府於昨晨九時，假靑年會，招待新聞界。由蘇省府委員兼秘書長陳言，出席報告蘇省一般情形。陳氏首述上海與蘇省之關係，但要將蘇省弄好，必須注意治安及經濟。略謂（一）江南匪患，可望於二三月內全部肅淸。至蘇北治安問題，較之江南尤爲嚴重。現在我國軍控制之下之縣份，僅有五分之一，而在共軍控制之下者，則有五分之四。日本投降後，淮陰·淮安·興化·如臯·均相繼被共軍佔領。最近鹽城又告失陷。共軍近又攻高郵。數日前，揚州曾一度極爲恐慌。故從治安方面講。蘇省現尚在戰爭狀態中。（二）關於經濟方面，地方收入現僅有五種：一·牌照捐，二·駛用牌照稅，三·屠宰捐，四，娛樂演戲捐，五·房捐。收入均極有限，地方經濟殊爲困苦。而開支方面則較昔大得多，尤其爲縣府所屬之部隊。江北經濟情形更嚴重，共軍到處發「抗票」，每元作價法幣五百或一千，共軍一走，即成廢紙。人民之痛苦，僅「水深火熟」四字，允不足以形容。目下開支方面，縣長只有向地方籌款，成立財務委員會。几縣府之預算·開支·借款·均須由財務委員通過。</p>

<h3>山城風雨</h3>
<p>— 梅幼雲</p>
<p>重慶有幾句幽默的話，是：</p>
<p>洞房花燭夜——隔壁子；</p>
<p>金榜題名時——二輩子；</p>
<p>久旱逢甘雨——冰雹子；</p>
<p>他鄉遇故知——債主子。</p>
<p>這次參議員的競選，有些人說：『當選名單』可以算是金榜因此道四百十五位候選人，爲了免去『二輩子』的註脚。競選的熱烈，倒是蠻『掛勁』的。大街小巷這幾天出現了不少競選的傳單：『選了×××今年的霍亂不　死那麼多人』；『選了×××電燈不會停電，自來水不會停永』；『選了×××每保有一個公共厠所』。這都是針對着重慶市民所要求的在宣傳。最惹人注目的是國泰戲院的經理，在戲院墻上廣告欄於畫了他的頭像，寫着：『請選我一票』。不仔細看，還當是電影廣告呢！</p>
<p>不管怎樣，反正這不能不說是重慶的創舉，山城的新現象。</p>
<p>馬歇爾特使來渝，更是萬人注目的大事。一個擦皮鞋的小孩，問賣花生的老頭：『馬元帥是做啥仔的？』老頭告訴他說：『就是從前跨海征東的薛仁貴。』你認爲這可笑嗎？不！應該說是可恥！</p>
<p>張篤倫市長接事後的第一件工作，是淸除全市的五十萬担垃圾。　大之內已經淸除了十四萬担，運去塡築一條到機塲去的路。這證明不怕垃圾多，就怕不肯去淸隊。『障礙重重』，並不能妨害大路的修建。</p>

<h3>掃霧器</h3>
<p>— 岳浩</p>
<p>一九四四年年鳳，歐洲氣候最惡劣，英倫三島，整個的被籠單在重霧之下，德國倫特斯脫元帥，利用這個時機，不惜驅使大軍，向美軍的陣地作瘋狂的反攻，他已突破比利士國境，迫使美軍步步退讓。似使英美此時不能出動重轟機羣參加戰鬥，聯合軍的命運已在不可知之數！倫特斯脫以爲英美的飛機在這種惡劣的氣候中，是很難有機會從機塲中起飛的，事實上這的確是非常的困難。可是，出乎他意料之外，在美軍後備隊還沒有抵達之前，大批的英美重轟炸機羣，已在德軍的後方怒吼，交通綫，補給綫，遭到全面的破壞，這個致命的打擊，終於使德軍敗退，失敗已注定，再沒有方法挽回了！</p>
<p>在英國主要的各機塲中，早有了掃籌的設備，這種大的發明不僅使飛機能安詳地起飛，安詳地降落，同時也救了不少因重霧而致自殺的飛機，搶救了不少因飛機自殺而喪失寳貴生命的飛行員。</p>
<p>一九四二年春天，飛機自殺的記錄天天在增加，竟比被德軍射落的數字鉅大，邱吉爾首相整天爲這些可怕的數字所煩擾，他命令英國的科學家，務必把道飛機之敵趕快地消滅。但他們都毫無把揑，最後終由發明噴火坦克車的魯特，肩起了這個偉大的使命。</p>
<p>魯特動員了五百多個專家，包括物理化學天文機械等等有名人士，日夜的工作，使用各種方法，如空氣的調節，電子的放針，化學藥品的吸收，最後他們一致同意，以爲最有效的方法還是使用熱空氣法，原來蒸氣因溫度降在露點以下才成霧，假使它熱起來，就不難因水汽的蒸發而使霧消滅。不過困難的焦點是怎樣供給這大量的熱力？</p>
<p>他們夜以繼日，不斷的生着火，用煤用煤氣，用一切可以發火的燃料，最後終於用最寳貴的汽油來試騐。在一個一百碼長的大油槽裏，裝滿了汽油。然後投下火種，頃刻間，火光熊，接着是可怕的淡黃色火熖，但並沒有像烟煤那樣可厭的灰燼，霧點受了熱力，很快的蒸發，不到十分鐘功夫，廣的二百碼，長約五十碼，高的八十碼的一個空間，滿天重霧，一掃而空，晴朗無雲，星光閃爍，這使他們興奮得無以復加，初步的試騐，總算完成了。</p>
<p>在英倫中部，霧最重的格蘭味闡地方，他們在一個大飛機塲附近，降落道的四周，裝了一個大規模的掃霧器，那是一個長的五百碼的長方形汽油管子，當他們實地開始試騐時，遠在五十哩外，還可看到它的火光，濃霧漸漸地消失了。在的三千呎長，一百五十尺闊，一百呎高的領界裏，你可以很淸晰地找尋任意目標</p>
<p>一九四三年十一月，在格蘭味闌的機塲上，就救護了四架因濃霧而喪失目標的飛機。在戰爭之末期，已有十五個機塲有着這樣的設備。</p>
<p>普通一次消耗的汽油的八萬加侖，在一小時內，要用去三千萬加侖，合一千二百萬美金’這個數目雖驚人，但它却救了不少的飛機和飛行員，想來這代價總是値得的！</p>
<p>掃霧器和雷達，在戰時同樣地，發揮了無比的功能，在戰後，仍將爲人類普遍地應用，並不像原子彈那樣威脅着人類的安全。</p>
<p>社會</p>
<h3>英國的人口恐慌</h3>
<p>— 廷鈞</p>
<p>據最近的統計，英國人口生殖率在近來五十年中，急遽的下降，假若在此後五十年中，不能將這趨勢遏止，那末，不列顚帝國將失去它軍事上的地位，失去它經濟上的重要性，海外殖民地人口減少，它再不能成爲一等的强國、</p>
<p>這並不是一件小事，以前邱吉爾也曾爲此事焦慮，他曾警告全國的人：『凡是關心我們國家的，就不能不注意到我國人口的將來！』邱吉爾也顯得　煩急起來。</p>
<p>照統計數字看，我們的確要替英國擔心，因爲從一九二三年起，直到一九三八年，英國的人口一直繼續在減少。假若這趨勢繼續下去的話，英國人口四千六百萬，到一九七五年就祇有三千一百萬，再過一百年不到，祇剩四百五十萬了。</p>
<p>爲了應付這嚴重的問題，英國特地組織了一個人口調查委員會該會的任務爲：進行人口的統計；調查生殖率　低的原因；推測生殖率降低後對各方面的影響；更研究各項防止的對策。</p>
<p>有一件事給調查委員會弄得胡塗起來，就是在最近的四年中，生殖率反比以前增高，起先以爲這不過是對以前突降的一種反應，但仔細研究後，才曉得還有別的原因，原來一九三八年前，歐洲先是戰雲籠罩，繼接着是局勢危急，大家雖也不敢再結婚，恐添室家之累，迨及近四年來，戰局好轉，堅苦的生活已經熬過，於是結婚的增多，生殖率暫時又增加了。</p>
<p>當局知道這不過是暫時的現象，爲求生殖率確增，更要緊的是使人們懷念到室家之樂。所以英國當局現在已在計畫發給職工家族津貼，注意人民的健康，促進兒童的福利，改良住宅等等。當局對這問題都不遺餘力的進行着，務期遏止這人口銳減的威脅。</p>
<p>農業</p>
<h3>農業方面的新改革</h3>
<p>— 汪國興</p>
<p>這次大戰期間，美國的農業科學已有一大罵人的進展，即：米穀收割與精製的新方法已被採用。這種改革，將使白米成爲更便宜更適於健康的食品。採用最近的科學方法，可以免去昔日所有的種種無謂損耗，例如以往用日光晒稻時，常因風雨驟臨而遭蒙意外損失。據說，應用新的收割方法時，每英畝可省勞力費十五元美金。</p>
<p>美國德撒士州霍斯頓地方的米廠，現用新的汽壓法來碾米，這樣可以大量保存米粒所含有的滋養成分。未經碾磨的糙米，在汽壓法的處理下，其皮質部分所含的養分，皆被驅向米粒的中心部分。收刈下來的稻，襲去外效後，即置於眞空器內除去其水分。此時，米粒外表光亮潤澤如玉，據說可防虫蛀。</p>
<p>另外一個新進步，就是改變木材素質的化學方法。據說，經過這種最新化學方法的處理以後，木質鬆軟的木材也能具有金屬的硬度，像白楊之類的木材，經用此法處理後，其硬度不但勝過柚木，甚且不亞於鋼鐵。</p>
<p>至其所用化學藥品，價錢並不貴。而且還可利用舊有的設備，無須另起爐灶。</p>
<p>小品</p>
<h3>夢</h3>
<p>— 蕭沉</p>
<p>從小就愛做夢，就喜歡幻想；幻想常常把我帶到空中，我會像雲雀般翱翔着。想到歡樂，我會愉快的笑了起來，想到悲哀，我會傷心的躱在小屋子裏抽泣。</p>
<p>但當夢醒來時，我開始覺到痛苦；在夢中我底愛是勝於憎，歡樂比失望的多。然而，無情的現實，打在我底脆弱的心靈上，於是夢破碎了。</p>
<p>在現產中，我受到的是悲哀，失望；但理智終於勝過情感，漸漸的，我會利用我天賦堅强的注意力，去應付這可怕　咒的現實。很快的，我變爲反對，咀咒這現實。</p>
<p>當另一個癢夢的孩子走來時，我跟他這樣說：</p>
<p>「夢是空的！那不過是一塲虛渺的變幻。」</p>
<p>我不想再做夢了，然而，若說這是夢，不是太殘酷了嗎？上帝爲每一莖小草降下一滴露水，也爲每一個年靑的生命，劍造一個美麗的春犬，爲什麼說是夢呢？</p>
<p>但是，我已經不能說什麼了</p>
<p>夢啊！夢啊！幻滅了吧！</p>

<h3>今後美國的民主敎育</h3>
<p>— 楊同芳</p>
<p>美國哈佛大學敎授十二人，組織了一個民主敎育研究委員會，負責調查美國整個的敎育制度，以期對民主敎育的實施有實際的認識。他們經兩年的研究，寫成『自由社會中的普通敎育』一書，於最近出版。</p>
<p>這本報告書，對美國今後民主敎育的實施，有許多具體的意見，對於大學和中學『民主化』課程及敎學，也提供若干建議，特別是敎材組織的『民主化』，凡足以促成學生民主思想發展的種種問題，都有極詳盡的討論。</p>
<p>美國的敎育思想，原是『民主化』的，即以著名敎育學者杜威，商戴克，柏克屈莢克，波德，吳偉士諸氏思想來說，已充分表現民主精神了。近代敎育思潮上的『敎育即生活』，『學校即社會』，『兒童本位』，」個性適應』等思想。也都以民主爲基礎。現在美國經過這一次反侵略反法西斯戰爭，更覺得有進一步促成『敎育民主化』的必要，而且要發展民主思想，最主要的還是要靠敎育的力量，所以哈佛大學敎授最近發表的研究，是很値得我們重視的。</p>
<p>這本研究報告中，很注重中等敎育一階段，因爲美國的中等敎育甚普及，同時中學畢業生有四分之三不升大學，如何使得這些中學生離校後能做一個自由社會中的良好公民，有健全的身心，正確的思想；實行的知能，優良的品格，這似乎比一味發展高等敎育更為重要。</p>
<p>美國一向有兩個不同的敎育觀點，一是主張『專門化』，目的在供給學生從事專門職業的技能；一是主張『普遍化』，目的在使學生都能獲得普通學識，各科目應當並重。前者在發現學生的特長，以訓練專門技術的領袖爲主，每個學生至少應該培養一種特別技能。主張這種思想的敎育家，可說是針對着現代複雜的工業化的美國實際需要。後者則認爲欲實施眞正民主敎育的精神，不在訓練專門的人材，而在提高國民的知識水準，敎育的目的除去普及民衆知識，力求『敎育大衆化』，沒有其他更確切的路向。主張這種敎育思想的敎育家，認爲要把寳貴的民族經騐，灌輸給兒童和靑年。這兩種不同的敎育思想，一種可以代表現實主義，一種可以代表人文主義。當然這不是絕對的，現在的美國已無純粹的人文主義存在。</p>
<p>這次哈佛大學敎授的研究，已經折衷調和了這兩種極端的思想，主張兩種理論都有並存的價値。他們以爲今後的美國敎育爲適應新的需要，必須有一個重心，這重心也就是指敎育實施的一個最高目標：綜合專門學識與普通知能。所謂敎育的重心，即是每個學生都須接受『普通課程」，因爲普通課程所包括的，便是民主社會自由國民的基本思想。民主思想的傳統和文化，將全靠這『普通課程』來連繫，來溝通，這是生活在民主社會中的公民所不能不了解的，而且進一步民主思想還要打破國界，要把人頫共同的民主思想的傳統和文化聯繫起來，溝通起來。</p>
<p>報告書上又說，這部分敎育工作應在中學開始。中學四年課程中，「普通課程」至少要佔一半，英文三課，科學和數學三課，歷史及與民主政府有關的社會課程三課。這樣，敎學特殊或專門技能的時間，不會超過整個敎學時間的一半。哈佛大學的敎授們又主張把外國語，如法文，德文，西班牙文，拉丁又，希臘文摒棄於「普通課程」之外，因爲這些都屬工具學科，不能直接表現民主思想的傳統和文化。</p>
<p>至於大學課程，他們將它分做三類：第一類是屬於文學的，第二類是屬於社會科學的，第三類是屬於自然科學的。第一類研究各種文學理諭，思潮，文學史，文學作品。第二類則明顯的着重民主思想，包括西洋政治經濟法律社會各方面的思想與制度，美國民主思想與制度，民主社會中人民的問題，以及關於人類相互關係的課程。第三類包括各種近世科學知識的課程。</p>
<p>縱觀這次哈佛敎授對美國民主敎育所提供的意見，都能針對當前需要，充分滲透了民主精神。我們希望這些方案，能對人類的文化有偉大的貢獻。</p>

<h3>眞假辦</h3>
<p>— 柯定盫</p>
<p>具有眞本實力的山東人，在曠塲上表演着「呑鐵劍」，（俗名呑硬寳劍）周圍的看客，似乎一點引不起同情，有些人還要說：那柄鐵劍，有活動性，可以伸縮的，這是寃枉了那山東人，他實在具有眞實本領，直着喉嚨把鐵劍呑下去的。</p>
<p>同時在另一個曠塲上，看到了一個七擦七擦做手做脚的小熱昏賣糖的，他嘴裏胡七八道唱些低級的調兒，那同情的人就多了。因爲用耳朶聽的不比用眼睛看，假使你的眼睛患着近視，或許看到那山東人呑鐵劍時，祗有二寸長的鐵劍，那麼當然不費吹灰之力而把它呑進去，自然說他是假的而不予以同情。等到耳朶聽到小熱昏的瞎說瞎唱，雖然是近視眼，也是不妨，耳朶聽到的，總是眞的。所以周圍的一羣，都說小熟昏唱得好聽，而山東人表演得不够眞切。這樣，社會就會不安寗了。</p>
<p>一般掛羊頭，賣狗肉的，是那麼的多，具有眞本實力的雖然也有，無如有目無珠的人似乎在那裏物色着冒充羊肉的狗肉，於是狗肉却交了好運，在人嘴裏咀嚼的多是狗肉，而他們「食而不知其味」的說着：「羊肉是多麼腴美啊！』吃了狗肉當是羊肉的人過多了，眞正的羊肉，就沒有如易牙之流，能够知道羊肉的眞味，而辯別出來。這就是不同情山東人而附和小熱昏的相當證實。</p>
<p>我不信現在社會，還有這樣的情形，「以耳代目」的時代早成爲過去，進步的現代人，難道眞和假，還會辨別不出的嗎？</p>

<h3>阿比西尼亞的油礦</h3>
<p>— 余範</p>
<p>阿王賽拉西在當年侵略國覬觀時，曾想出一個急法子：把阿比西尼亞境內的油礦開採權售與美國或英國油公司，希望因此引起國際糾紛，藉此可以阻遏侵略者的侵入。此事本有成功希望，但爲美國國務院所禁止，阿國也終於被義大利征服。現在世界和平，國土重光，阿王舊事重提，已把阿國三十五萬平方哩土地內的全部油礦租給美國辛克萊公司開採，但條約上訂明辛克萊公司完全尊重阿王神聖的統治權，將來並須將利潤一部份提出指充阿國公益之用。</p>
<p>但事實上，直到現在，阿比西尼亞境內還不曾發現過有油礦。</p>
<p>社會服務</p>
<h3>規定店員薪金標準</h3>
<p>— 君宜</p>
<p>希望社會局迅即實施</p>
<p>目前薪水階級最為淸苦的，莫過於一般商店的職員，尤其是那些規模不大的普通商號，店員們恐防飯碗的敲破，簡直悉聽資方的擺佈，雖欲言而不敢。依據筆者調查所得，至今尚有很多薪金是以僞幣計算的，最起碼的每月僅有偽幣二三十萬元，試問在這物價漲無止境的今日，這幾個錢尚不够個人的零用，遑論養家活口！此種不平的待遇，常局又何忍置之不問？</p>
<p>所幸本市社會局，早已有鑒及此，在上月間各工廠商號迭次發生勞資糾紛之後，有對職工之薪金待遇問題，調查各個實際情形，並聘定專家根據物價漲落之生活指數，製就枕計表格，訂定職工薪金待遇之標準底數，分發工商谷界的擬議。此項措置，倘能一旦付之實施，確是改善店員待遇最公允的辦法。但是時隔月餘，尚無確訊，能不令人望穿秋水！希望該局迅即實施外，並望實行以後，資方切勿視同具文，務須遵照規定，切實履行，才是最公允的辦法。</p>

<h3>Government Ceasefire Proposal Advocates Marshall as Mediator; Political Consultative Conference Scheduled for the 13th</h3>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 1st] On New Year's Eve, the government authorities proposed a ceasefire, advocating for the US Special Envoy to China, Marshall, as the mediator. Today, the entire country is eagerly awaiting the CCP's response. It is expected that the response will require thorough consideration by the CCP Executive Committee in Yan'an before instructing the CCP representatives in Chongqing to submit a reply. Regardless of whether the response is in agreement, the Political Consultative Conference is scheduled to open on January 10th, personally presided over by Chairman Chiang, with a session lasting thirteen days. In his New Year's Day broadcast, Chairman Chiang promised to make concessions as much as possible to seek national peace and promote genuine democracy. The only reaction from the CCP regarding the government's proposal was to publish the original text of its own ceasefire proposal. The CCP had previously refused to publish the full text, only revealing the general conditions to reporters. Now that the government has published the full text of its proposal, the CCP has also announced the original text of its unconditional ceasefire proposal, which includes the following: The CCP representatives, considering that previous talks had failed to reach an agreement to end the civil war, proactively proposed three unconditional methods for ceasing the civil war at the start of this round of negotiations, to alleviate the earnest concerns of people at home and abroad and to facilitate the progress of the Political Consultative Conference. First, both sides should order all armies nationwide to cease all military conflicts and remain in their original defensive positions. Second, all issues related to the civil war, such as surrender, disarmament, disbanding puppet troops, ceasing the use of enemy puppets, dividing military defense zones, restoring transportation, troop transport, and the recovery of liberated areas, should be resolved through peaceful consultation after the military conflict has genuinely ceased. Third, to ensure the implementation of the first point and the smooth progress of the second point, inspection teams should be organized by people from all sectors to go to areas where civil war has occurred, conduct on-site investigations, report the truth, and make it public. The government's proposals are as follows: (1) Cease all military conflicts throughout the country and restore railway transportation. (2) Because domestic military conflicts and transportation blockages are related to our country's obligations to the Allied nations regarding the surrender and repatriation of enemy prisoners, the government will appoint two representatives, the CCP will appoint two representatives, and together with General Marshall, they will promptly discuss and determine methods for ceasing military conflicts, restoring railway transportation, and other matters related to surrender, and submit them to the government for implementation. (3) The Resident Committee of the National Political Consultative Council will nominate five impartial individuals to form a military inspection team to go to conflict areas nationwide, investigate military conditions, transportation situations, and other matters related to the restoration of domestic peace, and submit and publish reports on the true facts at any time. When the Political Consultative Conference is established, it will also be invited to nominate impartial individuals to participate.</p>
<h3>Preparatory Committee for the National Assembly: Government to Select Seven to Nine Members</h3>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 2nd] China enters 1946 filled with hope for peace. On the one hand, the government has submitted a counter-proposal for the KMT and CCP to each send representatives to discuss ceasefire steps with Special Envoy Marshall. On the other hand, the National Army in Southern Manchuria continues its advance, having recovered Fuxin, Xinmin, Yingkou, Chaoyang, and other places. The government's proposal is a response to the Communist Party's suggestion of an immediate and unconditional ceasefire, and it requests the restoration of railway traffic and calls for five neutral observers from the Standing Committee of the National Political Consultative Council (not the Political Consultative Conference) to inspect the conflict areas. At the same time, the government has ordered the formation of a preparatory committee for the National Assembly, scheduled to convene on May 5th. The committee will consist of seven to nine members, all selected by the government.</p>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 1st] The US Special Envoy to China, Marshall, met with CCP representative Zhou Enlai for two hours today. Judging from various signs, Marshall will serve as a mediator in China's internal conflict. The content of Marshall's conversation has not been disclosed, but it is known that the scope of the discussion was very broad, including the CCP's proposal for an unconditional ceasefire by both sides. The CCP had previously presented its position to Marshall, but today's conversation was extremely detailed and the first of its kind, suggesting that the CCP is willing to accept Marshall as a mediator between the KMT and the CCP. According to members of Marshall's staff, if the CCP agrees to the central government's counter-proposal regarding an unconditional ceasefire, then Marshall is willing to serve as a mediator. Marshall cannot announce his position until the CCP replies to the government's peace proposal, but it can be assumed that the government consulted with Marshall beforehand.</p>
<p>[United Press, New York, 1st] The New York Sun reported yesterday that General Marshall's mission as Special Envoy to China has had a "smooth start". "Although the conditions proposed by the Communist Party have not been made public, the report that the Chinese Communist Party has made a written proposal for an immediate and unconditional ceasefire across the country is indeed good news from Chongqing. Spokesmen for the Kuomintang have often expressed dissatisfaction with the Communist Party's unreliability, saying that as soon as a proposal is accepted for consideration, new issues are often raised and new problems arise. Now that it has been put in writing, it is unlikely to be as fickle as in the past. The Communist Party's change may be due to the fact that the Soviet Union seems to have decided to take consistent steps with other Allied countries to support Chairman Chiang. But it seems more appropriate to say that the Communist Party's adaptability is due to the rapid exertion of General Marshall's power. When the Special Envoy first set foot on Chinese soil, he made it clear that the United States' main goal in China was to promote national unity. After arriving in China, he immediately consulted at length with leaders of various parties and brought representatives of various parties together for discussions. The newspaper said that efforts to end the civil war often showed signs of a solution, but ultimately failed due to the obstinacy of one party. The newspaper concluded with a warning that this situation may occur again.</p>
<h3>General He Yingqin to Inspect Various Locations Immediately, Bai Chongxi Flies to Nanjing Today</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 2nd] The United Nations Military Conference will open in England in the middle of this month. General He Yingqin, Chief of Staff of our country's representative, is about to leave the country. Before his departure, he decided to first fly to various locations for inspection before departing to attend the conference. Deputy Chief of Staff General Bai Chongxi is scheduled to fly to Nanjing on the 3rd with Deputy Minister Liu Fei.</p>
<h3>President Song in Beiping Encourages Compatriots</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 2nd] In his New Year's Day speech in Beiping, President Song encouraged compatriots to work together to restore transportation internally and stabilize prices, and to determine exchange rates and develop international trade externally. President Song also hosted a lunch on the 2nd for all members of the Beiping Political Consultative Council to hear their opinions on the current issues in the North. President Song expressed his willingness to seek solutions in the short term.</p>
<h3>Citizens of Chongqing Sign Names, Compiled and Presented to the Chairman to Express Respect</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 2nd] The citizens of Chongqing, in recognition of Chairman Chiang's leadership in the War of Resistance and the completion of peace, have united to sign their names to express respect on the occasion of the founding anniversary of the Republic of China. The prepared name lists are extremely exquisite and adorned with eulogies. More than a hundred of these signature books have been collected, with a total of more than 100,000 participants. Representatives from various civil society groups have been appointed to deliver them to the Military Affairs Office of the National Government for forwarding.</p>
<h3>Chiang Ching-kuo's Mission to the Soviet Union: Exchange of General Opinions on Sino-Soviet Cooperation, Announced by Minister Wu at a Reception for Foreign Reporters</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 2nd] A reception for foreign reporters was held at 3:00 PM on the 2nd, hosted by Minister Wu Guozhen, Deputy Minister Liu Cuo, and Counselor Zhang Pingqun. The following is a transcript of the main questions and answers: A reporter asked about the purpose of Chiang Ching-kuo's visit to the Soviet Union. Answer: Chiang Ching-kuo is visiting the Soviet Union as a personal representative of Chairman Chiang to exchange general opinions on Sino-Soviet cooperation. The reporter asked, what is the Communist Party's response to the three proposals for stopping the conflict put forward by the government on New Year's Eve? Answer: The government is still awaiting a reply from the Communist Party. Question: What is the extent of the damage caused by the excavation of the levee in the Jietan area of the Yellow River in Henan Province, which occurred in TaiKang? Answer: According to reports from the Seventh District Military Affairs Office of the province to the Executive Yuan, the Communist Army attempted to excavate and release the river dike north of Baitian on October 3rd of last year. The flooded area is approximately 120 li long and 3 li wide, inundating 2 million mu of farmland. The property loss is estimated to be 136 million yuan. Question: When will all departments of the government be able to fully move to Nanjing? Answer: Currently, transportation primarily relies on airplanes, so the capacity is limited. When the river water rises next spring and large ships can sail, it is hoped that all central government officials can work in Nanjing between March and April.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Rebirth of Indonesia</h3>
<p>The situation in the Dutch East Indies has been turbulent since the surrender of the enemy. Some radical elements in the nationalist movement, in the movement for national autonomy and independence, not only harbor anti-Dutch sentiments, but also inevitably have strong xenophobic actions; therefore, for a time, the situation in the Dutch East Indies seemed quite chaotic. The order in major ports such as Surabaya was also quite chaotic, so that the British army, which was responsible for accepting the surrender of the Japanese army in the Dutch East Indies, had to take decisive action. If this situation were allowed to develop, it would have a great impact on the reconstruction of peace in East Asia. A considerable number of Chinese people reside in the Dutch East Indies; we cannot but express our concern about the development of the situation in the Dutch East Indies. Yesterday's London telegram said that the United Kingdom and the Netherlands had reached an agreement on the policy towards the Dutch East Indies, and the Netherlands had revised its policy towards the Dutch East Indies. Following the meeting of the three foreign ministers, there is a new dawn in the Far East situation, which is really gratifying.</p>
<p>Since the Dutch East Indies Deputy Governor-General Van Mook flew to Europe, it has been generally hoped that an appropriate way to resolve the situation in the Dutch East Indies can be found. The communique issued from 10 Downing Street yesterday stated that the British government reiterated to its ally, the Netherlands, its obligation to quickly establish safe conditions so that the government of the Dutch East Indies could continue negotiations with representatives of Indonesia. At the same time, the negotiations conducted recently between Dutch Prime Minister Schermerhorn and British Prime Minister Attlee have also concluded and an agreement has been reached. Britain has declared that once the British army has completed its mission of disarming the Japanese army and liberating prisoners of war in Java, it will immediately withdraw. The two governments also believe that the solution to the political conflict is a major contribution to the task entrusted to the United Kingdom by the Supreme Allied Commander; and this task is to clear the Japanese army in these areas, which is related to the three parties, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and the people of Indonesia.</p>
<p>At the time when the United Kingdom and the Netherlands reached an agreement on the policy towards Java, it was reported that the government of the Dutch East Indies had also revised its policy towards Java. In a speech to reporters in London, Dutch East Indies Deputy Governor-General Van Mook said that the conditions he and representatives of Indonesia put forward in November had been revised and believed that Indonesians would be able to accept them. As for what this new policy is, Van Mook has not yet revealed it; but according to qualified observers, this new policy will include granting the people of the East Indies a new constitution, so that the islands of the East Indies can unite as one and obtain a status like Canada and Australia, and be linked to the Netherlands. This is a "Dominion" system, which can be completely independent and autonomous in internal and even external affairs; but in terms of national defense and military affairs, it must be united with the Netherlands. Whether this system can be accepted by Indonesians is still unknown; but the proposal of this suggestion is undoubtedly a good step towards solving the situation in the Dutch East Indies.</p>
<p>Originally, the deterioration of the situation in the Dutch East Indies was inevitably due to the fact that the general radical elements were poisoned by the "Greater East Asia" deceptive propaganda. A group of Indonesians who cooperated with the Japanese under the rule of the Japanese, because the Japanese surrendered, were incited and supported by the Japanese army, obtained the equipment of the Japanese army, and accepted the training of the Japanese army, thereby raising the banner of national movement. The beginning of this movement, rather than seeking the independence and autonomy of Indonesians, was to cover up their past crimes of cooperating with the Japanese. The people who lead this movement still hope to win the sympathy of the world and give them support. But the world's public opinion will not give them strong support. China itself has been working hard for the national liberation movement for fifty years, and not only has moral sympathy for the liberation movement of the ruled nations, but also gives as much support as possible within the possible range. The announcement of the Cairo Conference and the support for the Korean national movement show our attitude towards the liberation movement of the ruled nations. If the Indonesian national movement is truly a spontaneous liberation movement, the Chinese people should give it moral support. A gratifying sign in the Indonesian national movement is the gradual rise of moderate elements, and there is hope that the poison of "Greater East Asia" can be cleared day by day.</p>
<p>It is under this situation that we see the agreement between the United Kingdom and the Netherlands on the policy towards Java and the revision of the Dutch policy. Although it remains to be seen what the new Dutch policy will be, if the telegram is reliable, it has to be considered quite generous and wise. The Netherlands and the East Indies have had a deep historical relationship for more than 300 years. In recent years, the Dutch rule over the East Indies has been relatively enlightened. If the "Dominion" system is proposed, on the one hand, it can satisfy the Indonesian people's desire for national autonomy, and on the other hand, it can prevent the historical relationship between the Netherlands and the East Indies for 300 years from being abandoned. It is indeed the most ideal way to resolve the situation. Indonesia is composed of countless islands scattered in the Southeast Pacific. In the past, Dutch rule has maintained the unity of Indonesia to some extent. Now is the era of atomic energy, and the international situation still needs to be further adjusted. Dutch East Indies Deputy Governor-General Van Mook himself is Indonesian, and he is very clear about the wishes of Indonesians; this time he returned from Europe with a new plan, and he believes that he may have satisfactory negotiations with Indonesian leaders, and then reach an agreement. The peace in Southeast Asia and the rebirth of Indonesia all depend on this.</p>
<h3>The Old Capital is Filled with Joy in the New Year; Pent-up Grievances Are Released Completely</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 1st] The New Year has arrived in the old capital amidst a faint joy. Although, besides the fluttering of brand new national flags and some colorful arches on the streets, and the intermittent sound of firecrackers in the air, it seems that there is no enthusiastic atmosphere, but President Song's cancellation of the already decided postal and telecommunications price increase has poured cold water on the crazy prices, allowing people under the heavy pressure of life to breathe a sigh of relief and welcome the New Year. The drafting of the measures for the resumption of work in factories has also allowed unemployed workers in victory to see a ray of dawn. It has been very cold these few days, and there is snow everywhere on the streets and roofs. The roads are frozen and slippery, but fortunately, the flour from the Relief Administration arrived just in time, and poor children can also taste American flour. From 0:00 this morning, vehicles have been moving on the right side of the road. As of 8:00 PM, there have been no reports of any unfortunate events. Many cars that were driving on the left side of the road were reminded by oncoming vehicles. The whole city is on holiday for one day. The quiet cinemas and restaurants are all expanding. On the skating rink in Beihai, there are also more red and green young men and women. Only the Enemy and Puppet Industry Disposal Office is the busiest, because it has to sort out a mess of silk since March in a few days. The Relief Administration is also working as usual, because many anemic hands are reaching out to them.</p>
<p>Comforting Poor Teachers</p>
<p>Poor and noble teachers have not been forgotten. Zhang Hongjie, a supervising commissioner of the Ministry of Education, is preparing to visit them door-to-door today to express his condolences and send them a bag of American flour. The students of the Temporary University Tutoring Class received 50 yuan in food allowance per person today, which is said to be enough to taste meat. Several major newspapers today doubled in size. The Huabei Daily editorial, "Welcoming the First Peaceful Year," appealed to politicians of all major countries to have a common sense of responsibility for the happiness of all mankind, and said that in the future, the person who can best enjoy the worship of mankind will be a politician with world aspirations, not a hero who pins the safety and prosperity of his own country on the terror and poverty of other countries. The Yishi Daily's editorial, "Our New Expectations," pointed out that the 35th year is China's year of destiny, and it loudly called for the people's livelihood to be stable. If there is more turmoil and displacement this year, it will be the great humiliation of the 35th year. If someone fires a shot, it will be a sinner of the times. If someone is corrupt, he does not deserve to live in the 35th year. Cheng Shewo personally wrote a big article in the Shijie Daily, asking the government and people to abide by the law, settle matters, and fulfill their responsibilities. There are several articles on the newspaper that cater to the occasion, but what is eye-catching is a passage in the news column about Zhang Ji's New Year's Eve speech to the Youth Corps. He used the example of building a house with engineers with many opinions that would inevitably fail, explaining that one-party rule is still necessary in the reconstruction of the country.</p>
<p>President Song and Others Watch a Play</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 1st] The celebration of New Year's Day in Beiping included a group worship and a military parade in the morning. In the afternoon, the New Year's Day Celebration Preparatory Committee, organized by Director Li and Chief Sun, with Mayor Xiong as the deputy chair, hosted a masquerade ice skating competition at 2:00 PM in front of the Ningzhai Hall in Beihai. The participants were dressed in novel and varied costumes. Beihai was open to the public for free, and the crowds of people who came to the venue to watch were extremely crowded. On the Yilan Hall, people stood like mountains, and around the ice rink, people gathered like ants, crowding together in a grand scene. At 7:00 PM, fireworks were set off in Dongdan Square. Silver flowers and fire trees, flowing light and scattered colors, coupled with the various firecrackers set off by the city's merchants and American barracks, from morning to evening, the sound of thunder added to the New Year's scenery. The exhibition of historical photos from the September 18th and January 28th incidents and the photos of the Premier and President will be held from New Year's Day for three days at the Waterside Pavilion in You Shan Park, open to the public. The Line Command's Propaganda Department and the Municipal Government held a soiree at 8:00 PM in Huairen Hall, gathering famous actors from Beiping to perform Peking opera. President Song, Special Envoys Zhang and Lu, and heads of various institutions were invited to watch the play, which was one of the most exciting scenes in the celebration of New Year's Day. During the period of the city's fall, under the oppression and trampling of the enemy puppets, the people of Beiping lived in peace and sought survival. They had no interest in seeking happiness during festivals, and they had few opportunities to vent their depression. Today, the country has regained its glory, and the whole world is celebrating together. As such, the people have the opportunity to participate in various celebration programs, and the pent-up hatred and grievances of the past have been released completely. From now on, the beginning of a new era, the officials and people will unite and jointly embark on the road to prosperity and happiness. Therefore, today's celebration of New Year's Day has laid the foundation for rejuvenation.</p>
<p>Guangzhou Celebrates Enthusiastically</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Guangzhou, 1st] All sectors here enthusiastically celebrated New Year's Day, and the grand occasion was unprecedented.

The Japanese prisoners of war serving in various agencies were also granted three days of leave to return to the concentration camp to rest.</p>
<h3>The Plan to Airlift Troops to the Northeast Will Be Abandoned; National Army Can Gradually Take Over Defense; Director of the Line Command, Xiong Shihui, Goes to Tianjin for Inspection</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 2nd] Reliable sources say that the plan to airlift large numbers of National Army troops to Changchun and Harbin has been almost completely abandoned today. Because the Soviet army has postponed its withdrawal, our army can gradually take over the defense as the Soviet army withdraws, and there is no need to airlift large numbers of National Army troops. A certain division that was previously prepared for air transport has now been reassigned. Division Commander Sun and Li Zefen will leave Beiping for Tianjin and then Tangshan. However, in order to ensure the safety of personnel receiving the provinces and cities, a security team will be airlifted to Changchun and depart with personnel from various provinces and cities for takeover. Yesterday, on New Year's Day, Beiping heard that the airlift had been temporarily suspended for one day. It is reported that the personnel from the Songjiang, Hejiang, and Nenjiang provincial governments will depart on the 1st and 2nd. The personnel from Dalian and Andong are scheduled for the last, ninth batch. The order in Liaobei Province is stable, and Liu Lundong can move into the provincial capital Sipingjie in a short time.</p>

<h3>The National Army Steadily Advances into Northern Jiangsu; Commander Tang Sincerely Comforts the Elders; The Communist Army's Deceptive Tactics Undoubtedly Failed</h3>
<p>[Our Yangzhou Correspondent, 2nd] The elite National Army entering Northern Jiangsu is steadily reinforcing Taixian. The vanguard crossed Yiling yesterday. The Communist army's invasion of Yiling, a key point on the Yangzhou-Taizhou highway, was repelled by a small number of National Army soldiers in less than 24 hours. Although the Communist army appeared to be reinforcing, it failed due to insufficient transportation. Within thirty li on both sides of the Yangzhou-Taizhou highway, there will likely be no space for the Communist army to stand within three days. Commander Tang Enbo, during his inspection here, sincerely comforted the elders of Northern Jiangsu at a welcome reception, stating that Northern Jiangsu would see the light of day again. Public morale is boosted and the tense situation of ten days ago, which caused the price of rice in Yangzhou to rise to 20,000 legal tender per picul (石), even higher in the countryside, has recently fallen back to 16,000 yuan.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 2nd] As of today, the Communist army in Northern Jiangsu has spent two weeks, deploying more than twenty regiments to seize Gaoyou, besiege Taixian, and threaten Yangzhen. However, the results of their battles are tragic. Shaobo and Gaoyou have been retaken by the National Army. From New Year's Eve to the early morning of New Year's Day, Communist commander Su Yu used four regiments to launch a fierce attack on Taixian county seat from the southwest. They were bravely repelled by the defending troops and the National Army on the flank of Diaojiapu. This was the tenth fierce offensive launched by the Communist army after the defeat at Taixian, all ten ending in failure. According to those familiar with the geography of Northern Jiangsu, the organization of the Communist army, and its fighting ability, the Communist army in Northern Jiangsu is more coercive than effective, lacking in fighting spirit. If they do not stop fighting and retreat from Yancheng and Funing in time, they will inevitably suffer a disastrous defeat. There are three reasons for this: (1) The land on both sides of the canal in Northern Jiangsu is mostly plains. Outside Taixian city, there are very few high grounds and no tall and solid buildings, which is not conducive to guerrilla warfare. The National Army defends the city and guards the river, forcing the Communist army to attack uphill step by step. Therefore, the National Army can often repel a large number of Communist troops with a small number of defenders. (2) The National Army consists mainly of soldiers from Hunan and Hubei, and robust men from Shandong. These soldiers have fought bloody battles for many years and learned their lessons. Now that they are fortunate to witness the Japanese invaders surrender and the restoration of their homeland, they are celebrating their impending demobilization and hopeful return home. Unexpectedly, disaster has arisen within the country, and the Communist army has suddenly started a rebellion, filling them with grief and indignation, and strengthening their fighting spirit. On the other hand, the peasants who have been coerced into joining the Communist army in the counties along the canal in Jiangbei are mostly villagers who are content to stay at home and hate fighting. Education in the rural areas of Northern Jiangsu has always been backward, and very few peasants have received secondary education. They are easily coerced but difficult to teach. However, they have unwavering faith in and revere the intellectuals who speak truthfully and act respectfully. Now they see that the Communist army forcibly conscripts soldiers, and reduces taxes only to extort more. In order to facilitate looting, they do not hesitate to destroy the national currency system, issue "anti-currency" and worthless circulating notes, creating empty granaries and enriching their own families, while driving the people into ditches, glorifying it as "liberation". Although the peasants of Northern Jiangsu are ignorant, even women and children cannot be deceived by the true meaning of "liberation." No wonder that as an unorganized mob, they scatter like birds and beasts upon contact. (3) The biggest disadvantage of the Communist army in Northern Jiangsu in terms of terrain is the same as in other places, that is, they have people they can coerce, but no soldiers they can use. The Communist Party seems to have had a painful experience. Before the Japanese surrender, the Communist Party adopted an offensive strategy in politics and a defensive strategy in military affairs in Northern Jiangsu. Therefore, before September, the Communist army used anti-currency to absorb materials, adopting a cautious attitude. Their intention was clearly to use economic soft tactics to mystify their political deception, thereby consolidating their rule in the occupied areas of Northern Jiangsu. However, the people were already suffering miserably. Now, it is different. Since the beginning of September, the Communist Party has changed its offensive in Northern Jiangsu, attempting to seize Yangzhou and Taizhou, and expand its Yancheng and Funing base area, dreaming of drawing a line across the Yangtze River with the government army, and permanently solidifying its rule in Northern Jiangsu. It has repeated the mistakes of the puppet government, issuing circulating notes indiscriminately and forcing people to use them. The Communist army has undermined what it used to promote, that it would not issue banknotes indiscriminately, slapping itself in the face. Based on the above three factors, the Communist army's failure in Northern Jiangsu in the future will be a complete failure in military, political, and economic terms, without a doubt.</p>

<h3>Britain and the United States Engage in Diplomatic Activities to Prevent the Iranian Crisis, So That the Structure of the United Nations is Not Affected</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 2nd] Britain and the United States are currently engaged in diplomatic efforts to prevent the Iranian crisis from becoming a major problem at next week's United Nations General Assembly. London newspapers carry diplomatic reports from Tehran suggesting that the Iranian cabinet may experience its third resignation in a matter of days, and that after a day of efforts by the British and American ambassadors to Iran, the Iranian government may be reorganized. Officials of the United Nations organization hope that the first General Assembly will not be overshadowed by internal陰　, and want to maintain the strength of the first session to establish a security organization. The failure of the Moscow meeting to resolve the Iranian crisis has forced Britain and the United States to engage in diplomatic activities, as Iranian government officials are currently threatening to present this issue to the United Nations General Assembly.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 1st] News revealed today stated that Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov will not attend the United Nations General Assembly to be held in London this month, greatly reducing hopes for the early resolution of the Iranian and Turkish issues. Diplomatic circles here originally believed that the foreign ministers of the "Big Three" would all attend the meeting and take the opportunity to hold informal discussions. Even if there were no definite actions, they could seek solutions to various issues. Britain is deeply concerned that the disturbances in northern Iran and the Soviet Union's demands on Turkey will threaten the political stability of the entire Middle East.</p>
<p>The Iranian Government is Expected to Undergo a Complete Change</p>
<p>[Reuters, Tehran, 2nd] Iranian Minister of Transport Firouz resigned yesterday. Observers believe this is a prelude to Iran facing a final crisis and a complete change of government. Some people closely related to the government now expect Prime Minister Hakimi to resign as well, and believe that the intensified diplomatic activities of the British and American ambassadors are a sign of "important developments." One development generally expected is that Iranian policy will shift to the left. However, so far there has been no indication of direct talks between the Iranian government and the Soviet military authorities. A prominent Iranian intellectual stated yesterday morning: "We already know that Sir Bullard is carrying important diplomatic notes to the Iranian government after the Moscow Conference, and the American ambassador has also received new instructions on Iran from American affairs 貝爾納斯." Bullard is the British ambassador to Iran. After attending the foreign ministers' meeting in Moscow, he flew to Tehran yesterday. Despite it being New Year's Day, he immediately convened the embassy staff upon his return and consulted with American Ambassador Murray. He then met with the Iranian Prime Minister yesterday afternoon. According to Murray, he met with the Iranian Prime Minister yesterday morning and is expected to be received by the Iranian king in the afternoon. At the same time, according to Moscow Radio, the Vice Speaker of the Iranian Parliament has resigned. The radio reporter did not mention the person's name.</p>
<p>On Spain, Britain, the United States and the Soviet Union are United</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 1st] According to diplomatic officials here today, the United States and Britain will formally recognize the annexation of Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia into the Soviet Union this year. In addition, the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union will adopt a common policy on various diplomatic events this year. If this speculation is accurate, then since the Spanish Franco government has not been recognized by the Soviet Union, the United States and Britain will also sever relations with it. As for the recognition of the governments of Romania and Bulgaria by the United States and Britain, it has already been decided at the Moscow Conference. Since the convocation of the 21-nation peace conference and the conclusion of the peace treaties with the five enemy states have been fully agreed upon, the United States and Britain are unwilling to create further complications due to the Baltic and Franco issues, thereby disrupting the unity of the United Nations. Regarding the Spanish issue, the United States, Britain, and France will discuss the matter with Franco through diplomatic channels or formal meetings at the beginning of this year in order to decide on the attitude towards the Spanish government in exile. Some American officials believe that it is quite possible that the United States, Britain, and France will simultaneously sever relations with the Franco government this year.</p>

<p>American International Policy</p>
<p>The Government and the Opposition Tend Towards Unanimity</p>
<p>[Central, 1st] At the end of (1945), the surface of national joy in the United States conceals a widespread unease. It remains to be seen whether various internal difficulties in the United States will hinder its actions in foreign relations. However, there is one encouraging point: isolationism in American politics has come to an end. Everything suggests that the two major political parties in the United States will hold substantially the same views on major international policies. This continuous cooperation between the two parties will guarantee that the United States fulfills its obligations as a world leader.</p>

<p>Songjiang</p>
<p>County Magistrate Promises to Stop Issuing Substitute Currency</p>
<p>Songjiang County Magistrate Huang Chao-ren issued substitute currency due to the procurement of military grain. Wu Shao-shu and other fellow Songjiang natives in Shanghai telegraphed the provincial government, requesting the county to cease the practice. After receiving the telegram, Magistrate Huang went to Shanghai to meet and discuss with the fellow townsmen. As a result, he promised to stop issuing the substitute currency. Wu Shao-shu and others then telegraphed the Songjiang Rice Merchants Association, advising them to raise 3,000 shi (unit of dry volume) of military grain to meet the urgent need. Simultaneously, they telegraphed the provincial government, requesting the early allocation of funds for grain purchase to facilitate continued procurement. Furthermore, they pointed out that the procurement of military grain was being carried out simultaneously in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces. Zhejiang had already received full allocation of grain funds from the provincial government. As Songjiang and Zhejiang were neighboring regions with different approaches, progress was difficult.

<p>Hospital Doctors Take Over Wujin Hospital</p>
<p>Wujin Hospital in this county was run by the American Methodist Church. Its large scale and excellent performance over the years were praised by people in southern Jiangsu, along with Soochow Hospital.

When the Pacific War broke out, Dr. Baker and American doctors and nurses were forced to return to their country. The hospital was seized by the enemy as a military hospital, and other patients were absolutely forbidden to enter. Since the victory, Peng, the leader of the Changxi Receiving Group of the Ministry of Military and Political Affairs, sent personnel to seal it up. Zhang, a pastor, was then selected to go to Beijing to request permission from the Army Headquarters, along with the American consul, for the Methodist Church and Dr. Ta Kun to take over. The formal unsealing and handover procedures will be carried out on the 31st in Changzhou with representatives from the Receiving Group of the Ministry of Military and Political Affairs.

<h3>Readjustment of Yangtze River Ship Allocation</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The National Ship Allocation Committee is striving for accurate and prompt schedules for the transportation of demobilized soldiers and public affairs. The Yangtze River route is divided into three sections: Jinghan (Nanjing-Hankou), Hanyi (Hankou-Yichang), and Yuyi (Yichang-Chongqing). The Yuyi and Hanyi sections of the upper Yangtze River are particularly busy with transshipment affairs. Readjustments have been made to the ship allocation, and the meeting has resolved that the following ten ships should be assigned to the Yuyi section: Minyi, Mintong, Minxi, Minwu, Minqin, Minxie, Minsu, Min, Minlai, and Huatong. The Minqin ship was damaged in Dongshi due to shallow water and is currently under repair. There are still nine ships, which are calculated at 80% of the total in August of last year. For civilian and public transportation, 6,319 passengers and 2,630 tons of cargo can be transported. If used entirely for military purposes, more than 12,400 soldiers and 2,100 tons of cargo can be transported. The Hanyi section is assigned 12 ships, including Mingui, Minlian, Minzu, Minzhi, Minan, Tongde, Tongxin, Jiangqing, Yufeng, Hongyuan, Hongzhen, and Jiangji, which are transferred from Yichang to Hankou. Calculated according to November of last year, for civilian and public transportation, more than 7,000 passengers and 3,950 tons of cargo can be transported. If used exclusively for military transportation, 17,900 soldiers can be transported, and the cargo transportation is the same. As for the Jinghan section, because the water level in the lower Yangtze River is deeper, large ships can travel easily and there are more ships, so the Jianglun ships of the China Merchants Bureau can be transferred at any time... As the water level in the upper Yangtze River continues to decrease, if necessary, the Ministry of Communications will be requested to increase the number of Hanwan... that is, Hankou to Wanxian. As for the public subsidy for the Yuyi line, the Ship Allocation Committee has decided to increase it from January.</p>

<h3>Experiencing Extreme Torture, Unjust Grievance Unresolved: The Blood and Tears History of Yang Wendao, Recalculating the Old Account of the Zhongshan Hide Case</h3>
<p>— By Our Reporter, Ping Zhai</p>
<p>Who is Yang Wendao?</p>
<p>Shanghai people are notoriously forgetful. Mentioning Yang Wendao, perhaps very few people would know. Ten years ago, the three characters "Yang Wendao" once caused a sensation throughout the city and the entire country. He was the central figure in the shocking news of the Zhongshan Hidehiko international blood case!</p>
<p>Although Shanghai people have forgotten Yang Wendao, Yang Wendao cannot forget the people of Shanghai—cannot forget the great blood case of Zhongshan Hidehiko. Ten years of prison life, this fifty-one-year-old prisoner lives in the shadow of death every day. Yang Wendao thinks day and night: "I am wronged! For the sake of the country, I am in prison. When the day comes when justice is restored, I must have my grievance redressed!"</p>
<p>Hongkou Area as if Facing a Great Enemy</p>
<p>Returning to ten years ago, at 9:15 PM on November 9th of the twenty-fourth year of the Republic of China, a Japanese sailor suddenly fell to the ground after being shot at the entrance of No. 209 Doule'an Road in Hongkou. The sailor's name was Zhongshan Hidehiko. At 1:15 AM, the soldier died in the naval hospital due to his serious injuries.</p>
<p>After receiving the news, the Japanese Marine Corps immediately dispatched more than a hundred soldiers to guard all key points in Hongkou. Armored vehicles sped through the streets, and the Japanese soldiers on the vehicles were fully armed, as if all the Chinese people in Hongkou were their charging enemies.</p>
<p>The hearts of the people in Hongkou were uneasy. Citizens packed their belongings and fled to the concessions for "refuge." Rumor had it that "The Japanese soldiers are about to rush in!" The situation was extremely tense at that time. The Public Security Bureau, the concession authorities, and the Japanese consulate offered a huge reward for capturing the murderer, a total of 12,000 yuan, enough to buy twelve gold bars at the market price at the time. On April 21st of the twenty-fifth year, a suspect was finally arrested.</p>
<p>Finding a Clue, Discovering a Book</p>
<p>The case was solved by Hirayama, who was actually Zheng Huimin, a Guangdong person who had become a Japanese national and a venereal disease doctor.</p>
<p>At that time, Zheng Huimin went to report to Japanese Detective Nakamura Nagao, saying, "The handgun belongs to Korean Jack. On the night of November 9th, Jack and 'Little Guangdong' and two others were walking on Baole'an Road when they encountered Zhongshan. Near Fengleli, Jack handed the handgun to Little Guangdong, who assassinated Zhongshan."</p>
<p>"Little Guangdong's" real name was Ye Haisheng, who was a dance hall leader. In December of the twenty-fourth year, he took dancers to Qingdao to open the Vienna Dance Hall. After the police obtained the lead, they sent people to Qingdao and arrested Ye Haisheng in mid-April of the twenty-fifth year, escorting him to Shanghai. Ye was a member of the Hongshun Society, and the police claimed to have found a clue, arresting Yang Wendao, the chairman of the Hongshun Society, on April 19th. At the same time, they found a green-covered "Practical Physics" book in Yang's home. Yang Wendao's fate was sealed by this book.</p>
<p>Self-Defense Handgun Had Been Returned Earlier</p>
<p>A handgun-shaped cavity had been hollowed out in this "Physics" book, which could hold a handgun. Yang Wendao said that his book contained his "Timon" brand self-defense gun, but that gun had already been returned to the police. However, when the police took out the Timon brand handgun and tried to put it into the cavity in the book, they couldn't fit it in. When they tried to put in the PB brand handgun that killed Zhongshan Hidehiko, it fit perfectly!</p>
<p>Because of these pieces of evidence, the police brought charges against Ye and Yang.</p>
<p>On May 1st, the First Criminal Court of the Shanghai Special Court began the trial. Ye Haisheng admitted to witnessing Yang Wendao firing the shot. On May 6th, when the court reopened, Ye Haisheng said that he did it all himself, and Yang Wendao was not involved at all.</p>
<p>Yang Wendao said that the "Practical Physics" book was definitely not the one he originally owned. He knew nothing about the killing of Zhongshan Hidehiko.</p>
<p>However, the atmosphere at the time was indeed tense. Every time there was a trial, many Japanese sailors with weapons would be in the audience, listening to the proceedings. The court was surrounded by detectives, and an armored vehicle full of armed Japanese soldiers was often parked outside.</p>
<p>Unwilling to Surrender Under Torture</p>
<p>In his prosecution speech, Prosecutor Zhang Zongru also said that Ye and Yang were indeed wronged. He said, how could someone who committed murder keep the weapon-hiding book at home? Moreover, there were fourteen fingerprints on the book, none of which matched the fingers of Ye or Yang. Moreover, the cut marks around the cavity were very fresh. He spoke passionately, with tears in his eyes. Ye Haisheng himself had already fully confessed, but when the court opened on May 27th, he burst into tears, saying that he couldn't bear the torture in the police station and had no choice but to confess.</p>
<p>Yang Wendao was a tough man. Every day (!), he was tortured for four hours by the Japanese detectives in the Dixwell Road police station. He was waterboarded, forced to kneel on bricks, kicked, beaten, and forced to confess. His only response was, "Shoot me three times in the chest first, and then ask me to confess." The Japanese were furious, took off their leather shoes, and beat him wildly. He fainted several times but never gave in. He lived like this for six and a half months!</p>
<p>It wasn't until October 2nd of the twenty-fifth year that the case was finally decided. Ye Haisheng and Yang Wendao were both sentenced to death.</p>
<p>Filing an Appeal, the Verdict is Rejected</p>
<p>On October 11th, Ye and Yang both appealed to the Second Branch of the High Court. The High Court held a session and then declared the debate closed, rejecting the appeal. Yang and Ye then appealed to the Supreme Court. However, this was already December of the twenty-fifth year of the Republic of China.</p>
<p>In the twenty-sixth year, the sacred War of Resistance began. Until this day, the Supreme Court has not yet ruled on this case. Yang Wendao has been detained in the Tilanqiao Shanghai Prison since October 2nd of the twenty-fifth year, and he is still waiting to this day. Ye Haisheng, however, died in prison four years ago.</p>
<p>This criminal sentenced to death is waiting every day. He prays silently, "When the day comes when justice is restored, I must have my grievance redressed!"</p>

<h3>One of the Objects of Speculation: The Tumultuous Process of Hong Kong Dollars, Calculated According to British and American Exchange Rates, The Price is Cheaper Than US Dollars</h3>
<p>Hong Kong dollars in Shanghai have also become an object of speculation for general hot money in the past year. Rising and falling are often seen. There are usually two types on the market, old and new. Old goods refer to those issued in 1930 or before. There is also a 1935 version, which is about 10 yuan lower than the 1930 version. Small bills under 100 yuan are about 10% lower. The new goods are divided into the 1936 and 1937 versions, but the 1936 version with the number (2) is the same price as the 1937 version (number after C126000). There is also a 1934 version of 100 yuan bills (number after B485000) and 50 yuan bills (number after B350000), which are also the same price as new goods. The so-called new goods refer to those that have been declared invalid by the British government and whose numbers have been announced. At that time, when the market was still based on counterfeit Central Reserve Bank notes, the market price of new goods plummeted from 16,000 counterfeit coins to below 2,000. Small money shops and general holders who were engaged in this business suffered great blows. Because the money exchange industry continued to buy and sell, the market never stopped. A few days later, there were rumors that the Chinese government had negotiated with the British government for reorganization, which attracted speculators who made huge profits, buying in again when the price was low, gradually rising to more than 30 yuan in legal tender. Later, it was said that these invalidated banknotes were actually issued by the Japanese to repay HSBC deposits. In any case, there was hope for reorganization, and the market price was pulled up again. After the resumption of Hong Kong-Shanghai transportation, there was news that Guangdong, Macau, and Hong Kong were also buying and selling new goods at half the price of old goods, which once rose to more than 80 yuan. Recently, because the Hong Kong-Shanghai exchange rate was only 85%, the new goods there had fallen to within 30%, and the Shanghai market also fell to about 45 yuan. However, Hong Kong dollar old goods, calculated according to the exchange rate, have always been around 250 yuan in legal tender. Both sea and air routes are still buying new goods and transporting them from this city, and the inventory in this city is continuously decreasing. The market price of new goods the day before yesterday had recovered to about 75 yuan. It is heard that the price of new goods in Guangdong and Hong Kong has gradually risen to more than 100 yuan. Recently, the exchange rate has gradually been straightened out, and the trend is about to become popular again. Generally stable people, seeing that the market price of new goods is rising daily and the risk is also gradually increasing, have recently favored old goods, because old goods are legal Hong Kong currency. One Hong Kong dollar is legally convertible to one shilling and three pence in British pounds, which is equivalent to two and a half dimes in US dollars if calculated according to the British and American exchange rates. Comparing with the current US dollars, Hong Kong dollars are much cheaper. It is possible that in the near future, hot money will be dispersed to Hong Kong dollars.</p>

<h3>The First Batch of American Goods from Wing On Company Arrives in Shanghai: Gasoline and Diesel Oil Flood In</h3>
<p>[Special dispatch from this newspaper] A large amount of gasoline and diesel oil arrived in port. The American ship managed by the Fulai Company, "Detry Head Victoria," entered the port yesterday afternoon. It is said that in addition to carrying more than 5,000 pieces of relief supplies, old clothes, and old shoes, there were more than 10,000 barrels of Texaco and Mobil gasoline and diesel oil, and another 13,000 barrels were transshipped to Hong Kong. It is heard that a batch of American goods from Wing On Company, such as several boxes of wool silk fabrics, etc., were also shipped to Shanghai on this ship.</p>
<h3>Economic Briefs</h3>
<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Jiangping ship, loaded with 850 tons of coal from Qinhuangdao, is coming to Shanghai and is expected to arrive today. Recently, prices in Fuzhou have soared, and the prices of various daily necessities have fluctuated violently. The Municipal Government is discussing effective ways to stabilize prices and will hold monthly price and wage discussion meetings to assess prices and wages.</p>
<p>From December 28th, the Tianjin Municipal Government and its subordinate bureaus and offices, from the bureau chiefs down to the staff, will receive 50 kilograms of wheat rations for December, with a price of 20 yuan in legal tender.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance ordered all banks and money houses in Peiping to freeze the deposits of traitors, and they are not allowed to be withdrawn. However, although the competent authorities in the Pingjin area have arrested traitors one after another, no official list has been published to date. The banks and money houses cannot know who is a traitor and who is not, but in order to comply with the ministry's order, they have frozen all deposits. General depositors who are not traitors are complaining endlessly.</p>
<p>The redemption of pseudo-Lianyin banknotes in Pingjin has been decided by the authorities to begin tomorrow.</p>
<p>A guest from Changsha talks about the banquet donation. It will be levied from 60 yuan, and there is no receipt. There are no less than 400 industrial enterprises, large and small, operated by Hong Kong Chinese, and there are also 300 household industries. After the recovery, only a few factories have started to resume production. According to a recent survey, there are more than 30 larger factories that have resumed work, including the Hong Kong Nail Factory. More than 300 factories have not been able to resume work.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong Pre-War Orders</h3>
<p>Shipping at the Price Plus 25% Said</p>
<p>According to Hong Kong sources, for orders received by various foreign firms before the war that have not yet been delivered, it is heard that they will continue to be valid if the originally agreed price is increased by 25%. Once transportation is slightly restored, foreign manufacturers can ship the ordered goods to Hong Kong for delivery. It is found that the current market price of imported goods is much higher than before the war. If foreign merchants deliver the goods according to this method, the prices of various foreign goods will inevitably fall sharply soon.</p>
<p>Special Discussion</p>
<h3>How to Dispose of the Remaining Looted Yarn and Cloth</h3>
<p>— Pan Shihao</p>
<p>The center of the industry, the factories established by Chinese people themselves, and the factories established by foreigners are all based here. Therefore, its textile beam factories and related businesses, such as the yarn and cloth industries, account for the center of the city's industry and commerce. Since the outbreak of the War of Resistance, the source of foreign cotton and the mouth of colored cloth have been blocked, and this industry has inevitably declined. However, thanks to the efforts to acquire materials in the rear and the urgency of civilian use in the occupied areas, it can still maintain considerable prosperity. When the Japanese army occupied the former British and French concessions, the thickness of the yarn and cloth inventory showed that a certain part should be dedicated. Those in the industry, because their rights and interests are at stake, dealt with the situation in a roundabout way, while secretly accelerating the internal transfer to preserve their strength. The enemy was greatly angered and, on August 9th of the 32nd year of the Republic of China, used pseudo-organizations to issue pseudo-orders, forcibly buying them. As soon as the news was released, it shocked all directions. Those who delayed slightly or hid slightly were hunted down everywhere, as quickly as fire. The enemy's and puppets' military police and economic security teams extorted and squeezed openly and secretly, taking the opportunity to harass them. A large number of factory workers and shop staff lost their jobs as a result. According to the statistics of the Pseudo-Chamber of Commerce up to September 6th, the amount of yarn and cloth that was forcibly taken was</p>
<p>Cotton Yarn 92,103 pieces</p>
<p>Gray Fabric 1,420,160 bolts</p>
<p>Processed Fabric 5,022,720 bolts</p>
<p>Later, after further searches, it accumulated to</p>
<p>Cotton Yarn 95,254 pieces</p>
<p>Gray Fabric 1,444,400 bolts</p>
<p>Processed Fabric 5,273,680 bolts</p>
<p>Calculating cotton yarn, each piece can produce 40 bolts of cotton cloth, obtaining 3,810,160 bolts of cloth. Adding gray fabric and processed fabric, the total number should be more than 10 million bolts. Later, 29,849 pieces of yarn and cloth were retained (each piece of cloth is calculated as 40 bolts) and 26,712 pieces were exempted, nominally retaining production businesses to maintain civilian consumption. In fact, it only accounted for two-tenths of the total number. The amount forcibly purchased was still around 8 million bolts. If each person made a new set of clothes, it would be enough to supply the clothing for more than 50 million people. The heavy losses of the industry are self-evident. At that time, there were more than 1,000 dyeing and weaving factories, about 2,000 cotton cloth shops, and more than 1,000 yarn shops. As of now, according to the membership rosters re-registered by the respective trade associations, there are more than 500 dyeing and weaving companies, 700 cotton cloth companies, and less than 400 yarn companies, and most of them only exist in name, without the power to operate. The factories are only empty shells, and the shops have empty stocks. It is extremely harmful to the country in distress. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Once Panic in Gaoyou and Yangzhou: Communist Troops Harass Northern Jiangsu, Secretary-General of Jiangsu Province Chen Yan Reports</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Government received the press yesterday morning at 9:00 AM at the YMCA. Chen Yan, member and secretary-general of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, attended to report on the general situation in Jiangsu Province. Chen first described the relationship between Shanghai and Jiangsu Province, but to improve Jiangsu Province, it is necessary to pay attention to public security and the economy. He briefly said: (1) Banditry in Jiangnan is expected to be completely eliminated within two or three months. The public security problem in northern Jiangsu is even more serious than that in Jiangnan. At present, the counties controlled by our national army account for only one-fifth, while those controlled by the Communist army account for four-fifths. After the Japanese surrender, Huaiyin, Huaian, Xinghua, and Rugao were successively occupied by the Communist army. Recently, Yancheng was also lost. The Communist army recently attacked Gaoyou again. A few days ago, Yangzhou was once extremely panic-stricken. Therefore, from the perspective of public security, Jiangsu Province is still in a state of war. (2) Regarding the economy, local income currently only has five types: 1. License fee, 2. Vehicle license tax, 3. Slaughter donation, 4. Entertainment and theater donation, 5. House donation. The income is very limited, and the local economy is very difficult. However, the expenditure is much larger than in the past, especially for the troops under the county government. The economic situation in Jiangbei is even more serious. The Communist army issues "anti-tickets" everywhere, with each yuan priced at 500 or 1,000 legal tenders. As soon as the Communist army leaves, they become waste paper. The suffering of the people is not enough to be described by the four words "deep water and hot fire." At present, the county magistrate can only raise funds locally and establish a financial committee. All county government budgets, expenditures, and loans must be approved by the financial committee.</p>
<h3>Four American Soldiers Seize Legal Tender: US Authorities Take Back for Punishment</h3>
<p>(Reported by this newspaper) At about 4:30 PM yesterday, four American soldiers suddenly broke into the Fulong Sugar House, commonly known as Mantingfang, located at Wuhu Road, Guangdong Road, rushed to the accounting room on the second floor, seized 50,000 yuan of legal tender from the accounting table, stuffed it into their pockets, and fled. However, one of them, Adama, aged 19, wandered from Shandong Road to the back door of the Huangpu Branch Bureau on East Zhongzheng Road, looking for his accomplices. Fortunately, the shop owner, Wu Bin, chased after him and secretly reported to the nearby police chief at No. 272, who arrested him and took him to the Huangpu Branch Bureau. Two American soldiers, one Azore El Arden, aged 19, and one Dickerson, aged 20, came to the branch bureau to turn themselves in, admitting that they had robbed the store. The remaining American soldier escaped without a trace. Later, the branch bureau notified the US military authorities to send personnel to the scene, and they were immediately taken back for punishment.</p>

<h3>Mountain City Wind and Rain</h3>
<p>— Mei Youyun</p>
<p>There are a few humorous sayings in Chongqing:</p>
<p>Wedding Night - Next Door Neighbor;</p>
<p>When the Name is on the Golden List - Second Generation;</p>
<p>Long-Awaited Rain - Hailstones;</p>
<p>Meeting an Old Friend in a Foreign Land - Creditor.</p>
<p>For this election of senators, some people said: "The list of elected candidates" can be regarded as the Golden List, so to avoid the footnote of "Second Generation" for the four hundred and fifteen candidates. The enthusiasm for the election is quite "hanging". The streets and alleys have seen a lot of election flyers these days: "If you vote for ×××, not so many people will die of cholera this year"; "If you vote for ×××, the lights will not go out, and the tap water will not stop permanently"; "If you vote for ×××, every district will have a public toilet". These are all propaganda aimed at what the citizens of Chongqing are asking for. The most eye-catching is the manager of the Cathay Theatre, who drew his portrait on the advertising column on the theatre wall, writing: "Please vote for me". If you don't look carefully, you'd think it was a movie advertisement!</p>
<p>Anyway, this cannot but be said to be Chongqing's initiative, a new phenomenon in the mountain city.</p>
<p>The arrival of Special Envoy Marshall in Chongqing is even more of a major event that attracts attention. A shoeshine boy asked an old man selling peanuts: "What does Marshal Ma do?" The old man told him: "He is Xue Rengui, who crossed the sea to conquer the East in the past." Do you think this is ridiculous? No! It should be said to be shameful!</p>
<p>The first thing Mayor Zhang Dulun did after taking over was to clear the city's 500,000 dan of garbage. 140,000 dan have already been cleared, and they have been transported to fill a road to the airport. This proves that it is not afraid of having a lot of garbage, but afraid of not being willing to clear the team. "Obstacles" cannot hinder the construction of the main road.</p>
<p>The Political Consultative Conference is about to open: We hope it will bring us light and order.</p>

<h3>Fog Dispersal Device</h3>
<p>— Yue Hao</p>
<p>In 1944, the climate in Europe was at its worst. The British Isles were entirely shrouded in heavy fog. German Field Marshal Rundstedt took advantage of this opportunity, recklessly driving his large army to launch a frantic counter-offensive against the American positions. He had already broken through the borders of Belgium, forcing the American troops to retreat step by step. It seemed that if the British and Americans could not deploy heavy bomber squadrons to join the battle at this time, the fate of the Allied forces would be uncertain! Rundstedt believed that it would be difficult for British and American aircraft to take off from airfields in such adverse weather conditions. In fact, it was indeed very difficult. However, to his surprise, before the American reserves had even arrived, large numbers of British and American heavy bombers were already roaring behind the German lines, disrupting supply and communication lines. This fatal blow finally caused the German army to retreat, and failure was sealed, with no way to recover!</p>
<p>In the main airfields of Britain, fog dispersal equipment had already been installed. This great invention not only allowed aircraft to take off and land safely but also saved many aircraft from crashes caused by heavy fog, and rescued numerous pilots who would otherwise have lost their precious lives due to such crashes.</p>
<p>In the spring of 1942, the number of aircraft crashes was increasing daily, far exceeding the number shot down by the Germans. Prime Minister Churchill was troubled by these alarming figures day and night. He ordered British scientists to quickly eliminate this enemy of aircraft. But they were all at a loss. Finally, Lout, the inventor of the flame-throwing tank, shouldered this great mission.</p>
<p>Lout mobilized more than five hundred experts, including famous figures in physics, chemistry, astronomy, and mechanics. Working day and night, they used various methods, such as air conditioning, electronic needles, and chemical absorption. Finally, they unanimously agreed that the most effective method was still to use hot air. The original steam becomes fog when the temperature drops below the dew point. If it is heated, it is not difficult to eliminate the fog by evaporating the water vapor. However, the focus of the difficulty was how to supply this large amount of heat?</p>
<p>They worked around the clock, constantly making fires, using coal, gas, and all kinds of flammable fuels. Finally, they tried using the most precious gasoline for experiments. A large tank, one hundred yards long, was filled with gasoline. Then a fire was started, and in an instant, the fire blazed, followed by terrifying yellowish flames. But there was no unpleasant ash like that from coal. The fog particles received the heat and quickly evaporated. In less than ten minutes, a space two hundred yards wide, fifty yards long, and eighty yards high was swept clean of heavy fog, revealing a clear sky with sparkling stars. This made them exceedingly excited. The initial experiment was finally completed.</p>
<p>In Granby in central England, a place with the heaviest fog, they installed a large-scale fog dispersal device near a large airfield, around the landing strip. It was a rectangular gasoline pipe five hundred yards long. When they started the actual test, its flames could be seen from fifty miles away. The dense fog gradually disappeared. Within an area three thousand feet long, one hundred and fifty feet wide, and one hundred feet high, you could clearly find any target.</p>
<p>In November 1943, the airfield in Granby rescued four aircraft that had lost their bearings due to heavy fog. By the end of the war, fifteen airfields had such equipment.</p>
<p>Ordinary use consumed 80,000 gallons of gasoline at a time, and 30 million gallons were used in an hour, costing 12 million U.S. dollars. Although this number is astonishing, it saved many aircraft and pilots. It seems that the price is always worth it!</p>
<p>Fog dispersal devices and radar both played an unparalleled role during the war. After the war, they will continue to be widely used by mankind, and will not threaten human safety like the atomic bomb.</p>
<p>Social Affairs</p>
<h3>Population Panic in Britain</h3>
<p>— Ting Jun</p>
<p>According to recent statistics, the birth rate in Britain has declined sharply in the past fifty years. If this trend cannot be stopped in the next fifty years, then the British Empire will lose its military position and its economic importance. With a shrinking population in overseas colonies, it will no longer be a first-rate power.</p>
<p>This is not a trivial matter. Churchill was also anxious about this matter before. He once warned the whole country: "All those who care about our country cannot fail to pay attention to the future of our population!" Churchill also seemed very anxious.</p>
<p>Looking at the statistics, we really have to worry about Britain, because from 1923 to 1938, the British population continued to decline. If this trend continues, the British population of 46 million will only be 31 million by 1975, and less than one hundred years later, only 4.5 million will be left.</p>
<p>In order to deal with this serious problem, Britain has specially organized a population survey committee. The committee's tasks are: to conduct population statistics; to investigate the causes of low birth rates; to predict the impact of low birth rates on various aspects; and to study various preventive measures.</p>
<p>One thing that confused the survey committee was that the birth rate had increased compared to before in the recent four years. At first, it was thought that this was just a reaction to the previous sudden drop, but after careful study, it was discovered that there were other reasons. Originally, before 1938, Europe was first shrouded in war clouds, followed by a critical situation. Everyone was afraid to get married again, fearing the burden of family. Until the situation improved in the past four years, the arduous life had been endured, so the number of marriages increased, and the birth rate temporarily increased again.</p>
<p>The authorities know that this is only a temporary phenomenon. In order to ensure a real increase in the birth rate, it is more important to make people cherish the joy of family life. Therefore, the British authorities are now planning to issue family allowances to employees, pay attention to people's health, promote children's welfare, improve housing, and so on. The authorities are making every effort to deal with this problem, striving to curb this threat of a sharp decline in population.</p>
<p>Agriculture</p>
<h3>New Reforms in Agriculture</h3>
<p>— Wang Guoxing</p>
<p>During this war, American agricultural science has made great progress, namely: new methods of rice harvesting and refining have been adopted. This reform will make white rice a cheaper and healthier food. Using the latest scientific methods, all kinds of unnecessary losses in the past can be avoided. For example, in the past, when rice was dried in the sun, unexpected losses were often incurred due to sudden wind and rain. It is said that when applying new harvesting methods, $15 US dollars in labor costs can be saved per acre.</p>
<p>Rice mills in Houston, Texas, are now using a new pneumatic method to mill rice. This can greatly preserve the nutrients contained in the rice grains. Under the treatment of the pneumatic method, the nutrients contained in the cortex of unhulled brown rice are driven towards the center of the rice grains. The harvested rice, after removing the outer husks, is placed in a vacuum device to remove its moisture. At this time, the surface of the rice grains is bright and shiny like jade, which is said to prevent insect infestation.</p>
<p>Another new advancement is the chemical method of changing the texture of wood. It is said that after treatment with this latest chemical method, even wood with a loose texture can have the hardness of metal. Wood such as poplar, after being treated with this method, has a hardness that not only surpasses teak but is even comparable to steel.</p>
<p>As for the chemical reagents used, the price is not expensive. Moreover, existing equipment can be used without having to start from scratch.</p>

<h3>Dream</h3>
<p>— Xiao Chen</p>
<p>I have loved to dream and fantasize since I was a child. Fantasy often takes me into the air, where I soar like a lark. When I think of joy, I laugh happily. When I think of sorrow, I hide in my little room and sob.</p>
<p>But when I wake up from my dreams, I begin to feel pain. In my dreams, my love outweighs hatred, and joy outweighs disappointment. However, cruel reality strikes my fragile heart, and my dreams are shattered.</p>
<p>In reality, I experience sorrow and disappointment. But reason finally prevails over emotion. Gradually, I use my innate strong focus to cope with this terrible cursed reality. Soon, I become opposed to, and curse, this reality.</p>
<p>When another dreaming child comes along, I say to him:</p>
<p>"Dreams are empty! They are nothing more than a fleeting illusion."</p>
<p>I don't want to dream anymore. However, if this is a dream, isn't it too cruel? God sends down a drop of dew for every blade of grass, and also creates a beautiful spring day for every young life. Why say it's a dream?</p>
<p>But I can't say anything anymore.</p>
<p>Dreams! Dreams! Let them vanish!</p>

<h3>Democratic Education in the United States in the Future</h3>
<p>— Yang Tongfang</p>
<p>Twelve professors at Harvard University in the United States have organized a Democratic Education Research Committee, responsible for investigating the entire education system in the United States, in order to have a practical understanding of the implementation of democratic education. After two years of research, they wrote the book "General Education in a Free Society," which was recently published.</p>
<p>This report provides many concrete opinions on the implementation of democratic education in the United States in the future, and also provides some suggestions for "democratized" courses and teaching in universities and secondary schools. In particular, the "democratization" of textbook organization, all kinds of issues that can promote the development of students' democratic thinking, are discussed in great detail.</p>
<p>American educational thought was originally "democratic." Taking the thoughts of well-known educators such as Dewey, Thorndike, Burkholder, Bode, and Wu Weishi as examples, it has fully expressed the spirit of democracy. The modern educational thoughts of "education is life," "school is society," "child-centered," and "personality adaptation" are all based on democracy. Now that the United States has gone through this anti-aggression and anti-fascist war, it feels even more necessary to further promote the "democratization of education," and to develop democratic thought, the most important thing is to rely on the power of education. Therefore, the research recently published by Harvard University professors is worthy of our attention.</p>
<p>This research report places great emphasis on the secondary education stage, because secondary education in the United States is very popular. At the same time, three-quarters of secondary school graduates do not go to university. How to make these secondary school students a good citizen in a free society after leaving school, with healthy bodies and minds, correct thoughts, practical knowledge, and excellent character, seems to be more important than simply developing higher education.</p>
<p>The United States has always had two different educational viewpoints: one advocates "specialization," with the purpose of providing students with the skills to engage in specialized occupations; the other advocates "generalization," with the purpose of enabling students to acquire general knowledge, and all subjects should be given equal importance. The former focuses on discovering students' strengths and training leaders with specialized skills. Each student should cultivate at least one special skill. Educators who advocate this kind of thinking can be said to be targeting the actual needs of modern complex industrialized America. The latter believes that to implement the spirit of true democratic education, it is not about training specialized talents, but about raising the level of national knowledge. The purpose of education, in addition to popularizing knowledge among the masses, is to strive for "mass education." There is no other more certain path. Educators who advocate this kind of educational thought believe that valuable national experiences should be instilled in children and young people. These two different educational thoughts, one can represent realism, and one can represent humanism. Of course, this is not absolute. There is no pure humanism in the United States today.</p>
<p>This research by Harvard University professors has reconciled these two extreme ideas, arguing that both theories have coexisting value. They believe that in the future, American education, in order to adapt to new needs, must have a center of gravity. This center of gravity refers to a highest goal of educational implementation: integrating specialized knowledge and general knowledge. The so-called center of gravity of education is that every student must receive "general courses," because what is included in general courses is the basic thought of free citizens in a democratic society. The traditions and culture of democratic thought will all rely on these "general courses" to connect and communicate. This is what citizens living in a democratic society cannot fail to understand, and further democratic thought must also break down national boundaries and connect and communicate the traditions and culture of human common democratic thought.</p>
<p>The report also said that this part of the educational work should begin in secondary school. In the four-year secondary school curriculum, "general courses" should account for at least half, including three English courses, three science and mathematics courses, and three history and social courses related to democratic government. In this way, the time for teaching special or specialized skills will not exceed half of the total teaching time. The professors at Harvard University also advocate excluding foreign languages, such as French, German, Spanish, Latin, and Greek, from the "general courses," because these are all tool subjects and cannot directly express the traditions and culture of democratic thought.</p>
<p>As for university courses, they are divided into three categories: the first category belongs to literature, the second category belongs to social sciences, and the third category belongs to natural sciences. The first category studies various literary theories, trends of thought, literary history, and literary works. The second category clearly emphasizes democratic thought, including the thoughts and systems of Western politics, economics, law, and society, American democratic thought and systems, the problems of people in a democratic society, and courses on human relationships. The third category includes courses on various modern scientific knowledge.</p>
<p>Looking at the opinions provided by Harvard professors on American democratic education this time, they can all be targeted at current needs and fully permeate the spirit of democracy. We hope that these programs can make great contributions to human culture.</p>

<h3>True and False Presentations</h3>
<p>— Ke Ding'an</p>
<p>A Shandong man with real skills was performing "Swallowing a Sword" (popularly known as "Swallowing a Hard Sword") in a square. The surrounding onlookers did not seem to sympathize at all. Some people even said: "That iron sword is mobile, it can be stretched." This was wronging the Shandong man, he really had real skills, swallowing the iron sword straight down his throat.</p>
<p>At the same time, in another square, I saw a small performer selling candy, gesticulating and making faces. He sang some low-level tunes nonsensically. More people sympathized with him. Because what you hear with your ears is not as good as what you see with your eyes. If your eyes are nearsighted, perhaps when you see the Shandong man swallowing the iron sword, you only see an iron sword two inches long. Then, of course, it takes no effort to swallow it, and naturally you say it is fake and do not sympathize with him. When your ears hear the small performer's nonsense singing, even if you are nearsighted, it doesn't matter. What your ears hear is always real. So the surrounding group all said that the small performer sang well, and the Shandong man's performance was not realistic enough. In this way, society will not be peaceful.</p>
<p>There are so many cases of hanging a sheep's head but selling dog meat. Although there are also people with real skills, there seems to be a blind person there looking for dog meat that is pretending to be lamb. So the dog meat is lucky, and what is chewed in people's mouths is mostly dog meat. And they say, "I eat but do not know the taste," saying: "Lamb is so plump and beautiful!" There are too many people who eat dog meat and think it is lamb. The real lamb does not have someone like Yi Ya who can know the real taste of lamb and distinguish it. This is a considerable confirmation of not sympathizing with the Shandong man but echoing the small performer.</p>
<p>I don't believe that there is still such a situation in society now. The era of "using ears to see" has long passed. Can the progressive modern people really not distinguish between true and false?</p>

<h3>Oil Fields in Abyssinia</h3>
<p>— Yu Fan</p>
<p>When Abyssinia was being coveted by invading countries in those years, King Selassie came up with an emergency plan: to sell the oil field mining rights within Abyssinia to American or British oil companies, hoping to cause international disputes, thereby deterring the invaders. This matter had a chance of success, but it was prohibited by the U.S. State Department, and Abyssinia was finally conquered by Italy. Now that the world is at peace and the territory has been restored, King Selassie has brought up the old matter again and has leased all the oil fields within 350,000 square miles of Abyssinian land to the American Sinclair Oil Company for mining. However, the treaty stipulates that the Sinclair Oil Company fully respects King Selassie's sacred sovereignty, and will set aside a portion of the profits for Abyssinia's public welfare in the future.</p>
<p>But in fact, until now, no oil fields have been discovered in Abyssinia.</p>

<h3>Stipulating Salary Standards for Shop Employees</h3>
<p>— Jun Yi</p>
<p>Hoping the Social Bureau will implement it quickly</p>
<p>At present, the most impoverished of the salaried class are the employees of general stores, especially those ordinary commercial establishments that are not large in scale. Shop assistants, fearing that their rice bowls will be broken, simply listen to the arrangements of the capitalists, even if they want to speak out, they dare not. According to the author's investigation, to this day there are still many salaries calculated in counterfeit currency, with the most minimum being only 200,000 to 300,000 yuan in counterfeit currency per month. May I ask, in today's world of endlessly rising prices, this little money is not even enough for personal spending, let alone supporting a family! How can the Chang Bureau bear to turn a blind eye to this kind of unfair treatment?</p>
<p>Fortunately, the Social Bureau of our city has long been aware of this. After labor-capital disputes occurred repeatedly in various industrial and commercial establishments last month, it investigated the actual situation of employees' salaries and benefits, and hired experts to prepare pillow plans based on the cost of living index with rising prices, and stipulated the standard bottom number of employees' salaries and benefits, which were distributed to the industrial and commercial circles for discussion. If this measure can be implemented one day, it is indeed the most fair way to improve the treatment of shop employees. However, more than a month has passed, and there is still no definite news, which cannot help but make people wait expectantly! In addition to hoping that the bureau will implement it quickly, it is also hoped that after implementation, the capitalists must not regard it as a mere formality, and must abide by the regulations and implement them conscientiously, which is the most fair way.</p>

<h3>Investigating and Prosecuting Landlords for Mistreating Tenants</h3>
<p>Editor: Since the outbreak of the war, until now, our situation has indeed been too much under the control of others! Without talking about big things, just take our second landlord as an example. He lives in three or four rooms for free, not only does he not spend a penny on the first landlord, but he also has a large surplus. Electricity and tap water, everything, he has never spent a penny, all of which are distributed among the third tenants. This time, the power company has increased the deposit again, and he is happy to distribute it to all the tenants, requiring each tenant to pay a deposit of 1,000 yuan. Our house has three upper floors and three lower floors, with a total of thirteen tenant families (excluding the second landlord), so besides himself, can't he earn another deposit of 13,000 yuan? (Omitted) I am submitting the various points of doubt to your column for instructions, in order to dispel the doubts of the masses. (1) Are the third tenants obliged to pay the water and electricity fees for the second landlord? (2) In addition to the legal profits, can the second landlord occupy a large house and make all the tenants bear the rent? (3) When the first landlord has increased the rent by several percent or several times in the past, the second landlord also increases the rent on each tenant by several percent or several times, and does not allow the percentage multiple added by the first landlord to be distributed, is this legal? (4) Who should bear the deposit for tap water, electricity, telephone, etc.? (5) If the tenants agree to pay this deposit for him, should they ask for receipts for the money paid? (6) If he insists on being strong and cannot be reasoned with, which agency should we appeal to? Please give instructions on each of the above points, and please publish a reply in the newspaper so that the residents of the city can follow. Sincerely, reader Zhang Fuming.</p>
<p>(Note) What Mr. Zhang said is indeed true. In the past, during the period when the enemy and puppets occupied us, second landlords oppressed third tenants, which was a common occurrence. At the same time, there were also third tenants who were unreasonable and did not keep their promises. In the future, I advocate that no matter the landlord or the tenant, they must abide by the law, respect each other, and not be unreasonable. Regarding the six points asked, here are brief answers: (1) There is no such obligation. (2) The second landlord only has legal profits and cannot make all the tenants bear the rent. (3) It should be distributed fairly. (4) The landlord should be asked to bear it. (5) You can ask for receipts. (6) You should appeal to the Shanghai Municipal Housing Rental Management Committee.</p>
<h3>Enquiring About the Enlistment Period of the Security Corps</h3>
<p>Editor: The Security Corps of this city recruited members, and after being admitted, it was announced in the newspaper that they would enlist, and it has been a month now, but there is no news at all. When asked, they said, "It will take another two weeks, the houses have not been selected, so there is no way to settle down," etc. I have gone to ask several times, but I have wasted my trips in vain, and I am a stranger in a foreign land, and I am currently temporarily living at my relatives' house. It has been more than a month, and I feel ashamed to bother my relatives. Moreover, my relatives are not wealthy, and the cost of living is rising day by day, and I really feel unable to bear the burden. I have always admired your newspaper as the voice of the people, speaking out for justice. I can publish it in the newspaper to ask the person in charge of the Security Corps and the relevant military and political authorities to reply immediately, then we will be infinitely grateful. Zhang Ying, Zhang Yi respectfully submitted.</p>
