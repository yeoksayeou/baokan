<h3>東北行營將移瀋陽　長春蘇軍已在撤退中</h3>
<p>〔本報北平十八日電〕我大軍已進駐瀋陽，該處局面漸趨安定，東北行營與保安長官部已派員前往勘察地址，一週後即可移往，瀋陽在最近兩月內將成爲東北軍政中心。　〔中央社長春十九日電〕現有種種跡象可以證明，此間蘇軍準備撤退或已開始撤退。（一）市府已接獲蘇方口頭通知，準備接收房屋。（二）蘇方通知各食物商店，結算賬款，並通知市府結算公款，所發款項，半爲紅軍票，半爲盧布。（三）蘇軍前在此拘留之僞滿國軍千餘人，今已由火車北運。（四）蘇軍目前與此間麵包商店所定麵包，均以一二日爲期，不復前此之數月爲期。據悉，長春西區蘇軍業已撤退。　〔中央社重慶十九日電〕軍委會發言人聲稱：蘇軍參謀長特洛曾科中將所提，中長路潘陽。旅順間及潘陽·長春間，曾有多處遭受破壞，或埋置地雷等事，因該路秩序由中國路警維持，故中國政府應負責任一節，查長春路沿綫，各地均有甚多之非法軍隊，非有足數武力，無法維持沿綫治安。比次蘇軍自瀋撤退至長，事先並未通知我方，更未與我方預先洽商沿綫接防手續，及蘇軍撤退後一二日，瀋長間交通已爲非法武力阻碍，我不及派兵警衛，故中長路之交通破壞，在我軍未能到達該路沿綫以前，我方不能負有維持交通之責。</p>
<p>〔聯合社重慶十九日電〕此間半官人士聲稱，東北蘇軍司令馬林諾夫斯基之參謀長，昨在長春晤國府軍事代表董彥平，對長春大連間鐵路運輸「時常阻斷」提出抗議，謂，依照中蘇條約，該鐵路綫乃由中國方面負責保護，董氏答以該綫有不屬於政府指揮之非正規部隊，暗施破壞，致車運阻斷，蘇軍參謀長又說明長春迤南蘇軍除少數採辦糧食給養者外，現已全體撤退。董氏請蘇方保護國府派往東北接收行政官員，蘇軍參謀長答稱，蘇當局僅將負責保護蘇軍駐區，若謂國府官員受成脅，並無理由。</p>
<h3>共軍攻入四平街　遼北省府人員行踪未明</h3>

<h3>中興煤礦準備復工　共軍佔據東北兩井已被淹</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十九日電〕棗莊訊：中興煤礦三人共管委員會，政府與中共代表尚示派定，將由北平軍調部徵詢雙方意見後遴派。聞經濟部魚豫晉特派員辦事處接收棗莊煤礦專員吳克頤，將來祗能就技術範圍以內事項加以協助。中興煤礦爲共軍佔據之東北兩井被淹，南井爲國軍保護，未遭損壞，雙方軍隊現尙未退出礦區，傳國軍業作撤退準備，中興公司現正根據總工程師柯里克報告計劃有關修復工程準備復工。又棗莊之煤藏量似已有限，煤質則甚佳，最宜煉焦，日人經營期間，最高產量每日曾達四千噸，大多爲華北開發公司運回日本，用之於一般國防重工業，甚少以之燒鍋爐，最近佔計該礦如能順利復工，平均每日可產二千噸。</p>
<h3>參政會今開幕</h3>
<p>〔合衆社重慶十九日電〕國民參政會將於廿日晨開始舉行第二屆全體大會，蔣主席將出席向各代表致詞。</p>
<h3>全會宣言（續完）</h3>
<p>第五，我們要實行六次代表大會着重民生主義的方針。民生主義是三民主義所要達到的終極目的，在現階段，要推進民生主義，本會議認爲有治標治本兩方面。首先要安定秩序，解除民困，而後可以實行大規模的經濟建設。現在先要爲在飢餓綫上或是半飢餓綫上的農工大衆，公敎人員，及捍衛國家的官兵解除痛苦。他們的生活，必須發法改善。這就要先從穩定物價和維持幣值着手，政府必須盡一切可能方法，使其實現。當然我們更須恢復生產，來增加國內物資，購運糧食，以備災荒的救濟，厲行節的，以减少無謂的消費，遮立國際經濟合作，使國外物資，尤其是生產工具，得以大量輸入。但是目前最迫切的工作，實莫過於恢復交通，像現在這樣四處交通遭受破壞，人民不能自由來往，貨物不能暢遂流通，其他一切更無從說起，所以破壞交通，不但妨害民生，而且無異置人民於死地。本會議不能不坦白指出，希望軍事調處執行部，要切實制止一切妨碍修路工作與破壞交通行政管理的行動。</p>
<p>在治本方面，平均地糊，節制資本，是本黨必須實現的基本原則。救濟農村，抑制目前土地兼併之風，以扶植自耕農，同爲當前急務。實行戰後五年經濟建設計劃，允賴國際上經濟和技術的援助。本黨六全大會所定有關經濟建設各綱領，最正確的方案。九個月來，因爲戰事和復員的關係，還不能切實施行，實爲憾事。今後必須督促政府主管部門，加緊執行，上面所說的各項措施，使人民得由安居樂業，進而獲得生活水準的提高。</p>
<p>第六，要貫澈我們抗戰的初志，以保持國家主權，而鞏固世界和平，我國對外的根本政策，在確保國家領土主權與行政的完整，信守國際條約，以鞏固世界永久的和平，我們過去拒絕日本訂立防共協定的威脅，以及八年的抗戰最重要的目標，也就在此。現在抗戰已經結束，爲了戰後的建設，我們不但需要國內安定，同樣也需要國際和平，我們不希望國際間再有任何矛盾或隔閡的存在，使已經戰敗的侵略主義者存徼倖再起之心，我們以至誠擁護聯合國憲章，我們的代表，在國際會議席上，處處苦心，設法增進我們各大盟邦的合作，就是我們政策的具體表現。爲了建立太平洋永久和平與世界的永久和平，必須根除日本帝國主義再起的機會，這就是需要我國與盟邦間有充分的了解與密切的合作，尤其是和我們邊界相接最近的蘇聯，我們願以最大的誠意，增進彼此相互的信任和友誼。我們並且堅信，雙方嚴格遵守中。蘇友好同盟絛的，是增進彼此相互信任和友誼的首要條件，同時，我們爲完成經濟建設，在不違背中國法律，不抵觸與中國所參加之國際協定的範圍內，歡迎任何盟邦資本與技術之合作。因爲惟有獨立自主，統一强盛的中國，才能根絕日本帝國主義的再起，才能保持太平洋上，乃至世界永久的和平。我們深信，現在東北問題必可本此認識，求得合理合法解決的途徑，決不以一時的現象，而喪失我們的信心，怠忽我們的努力。　最後要喚起我們全黨同志愛護革命歷史，確立信心，認識自身的責任，在這訓政行將結束，革命事業進入建國的時期，本黨同志，要知道本黨爲中國最大的革命政黨，過去領導革命救國，今後領導革命建國，乃是我們數十年如一日的歷史任務。我們決不諉卸我們的責任，我們要記得中華民國是我們的總理和本黨先烈創造的，掃蕩軍閥，完成統一，是本黨領導完成的，百年來不平等條約約束縛，是木黨領導解除的，八年的抗戰，爲國家民族得到了光榮的勝利，又是本黨領導成功的。本黨旣然能完成這四個現代史上偉大的使命，我們更確信本黨在總裁領導之下，必能提携全國同胞，完成和平建國這一個更偉大的使命。已往訓政時期，在政治和黨務上，都有種種的缺陷，其中有許多固然是客觀條件使然，但是我們自己也責無旁貸。我們革命的目的，正如總理所說：「欲出斯民於水火，而登之袵席。」現在國家處境如此困難，人民生活如此痛苦，我們實在非常痛心，我們革命黨人，要勇於負責，勇於改進，我們必須深刻的·不斷　　的自我檢討。本會議認爲，我們要負起今後艱鉅的責任，必須集中意志，自反自强，以革新我們黨的工作，必須刻苦努力，爲民服務，以貫澈我們革命的初衷，更必須以推誠置信的精神，與全國同胞和各黨派人士一致努力，以促建國工作的成功。　在以往，本黨得到全國同胞的協力，使我們能不斷的達成歷史偉大的使命，到現在，我們就應該把光榮勝利後的中華民國建設成爲富强康樂的現代國家，我們要一致高舉三民主義的大旗，進入和平建國的光明大道。</p>

<h3>蘇駐軍延不撤退　伊朗正式提申訴　此舉或將引起內閣危機</h3>
<p>杜魯門將向史達林呼籲轉結</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦十九日廣播：望眼欲穿之伊朋申訴，終於昨夜由伊朗駐美代表送達聯合國機構，請求安全理事會在下星期一開會予以討論。內容指責蘇聯違反三國撤兵協定，並干涉伊朗內政。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦十九日廣播：華盛頓外交界人士認爲伊朗向安全理事會提出申訴，將促成伊朗現行沙丹納內閣之倒塌。據某方消息：莫斯科曾警吿伊內題，謂如伊方向安全理事會提出申訴，蘇方將視爲不友好行動。蘇聯新任駐伊大使今日可抵德黑闌，頗足重視。又菜已吿退之英大使蒲列德，巳於今日離德黑闌返國。　〔法國新聞社華盛頓十八日電〕此問否認倫敦方面所傳美政府限伊朗於二十四小時內，決定是否應將伊朗問題提交安全理事會之說。　〔央社華盛頓十八日專電〕聯合國機構秘書長賴依，本日乘機飛抵華府。美國務卿貝爾納斯於賴氏到達時發表簡短歡迎詞。賴依定二十日訪杜魯門總統及貝爾納斯，廿一日赴紐約。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十九日電〕今日此間外交界人士相信：伊朗之危機可能使杜魯門總統向史達林提出直接呼籲，要求三强團結。國務院方面否認此項消息，但在該項呼籲發出之前，自不能由國務院獲得證實。事實上，此種辦法並非無前例可尋，先前，在美蘇關係遭遇困難時，杜魯門及其前任羅斯福總統亦屢次向史達林直接表示意見。外交人士認爲在安全理事會於下週開會前，杜總統出以此一行動，實屬合理。　〔合衆社華盛頓十八日電〕國務院權威方而今日證實：蘇聯對伊郎所提撤退蘇軍之要求，已予以答復，惟要求伊朗讓與油權。據謂：關於伊朗油源之國際化問題，尙未與英國進行談判，惟指出此舉或爲唯一之解決途徑。</p>

<p>〔路透社拉霍爾十十九日電〕宇宙綫研究科學家即此間福門基督學院物理學助敎季爾博士近預測在不遠之將來，宇宙綫時代將代替目前之原子能時代。據季爾研究所得之心得稱：宇宙綫放射力可較現代工廠之成就强十萬倍，其單位分子之放射力，亦較鈾原子所分裂出之核心爲强，製造原子炸彈僅需少量鈾質，故若與宇宙綫相較，今之原子炸彈不過一球烟火而已。目前使用宇宙綫之主要阻碎，乃爲尙未發明加以裝置之方法，惟利用宇宙綫放射原子能之時期，當亦不遠，屆時進人新時代後，原子能時代即將漸趨落伍。</p>

<h3>專論　現階的上海金融問題</h3>
<p>— 俞增康</p>
<p>自勝利以後，上海金融仍繼着過去的狀態，處在動盪不安之中，尤以今年一月底後，波動更大，更轉入混亂狀態。當局雖取締投機，封閉黑市，然黑市活動，依然存在，迨至外匯市塲開放，　金政策重用後，金融稍趨安定，但嚴重性仍未解除，投機者仍在何隙而進，所以我們仍希望須有合理的改善，使能獲持久的安定，這是復員期問所必需的。况戰後經濟建設，更須賴於金融的扶助，所以金融問題的解決，金融動向的合理化，宜早日實施，不容再緩的了。</p>
<p>現今全國一統，上海復居金融的中心，變動的影響，已不如淪陷時期的僅限地方性，而已是全國性的了；此次的黃金風潮，即可爲說。所以上海金融的改善，更不容緩。至於改善，我們必須　中全力，對於已深的憲結，衆多的障礙，始能克服；切不可因噎廢食，遷就事實；不切實際的拈置，不可再用，徒生技節，以增困難，原有弱點，亦不容再有細微的存在，以增戰後經濟建設上的障礙。</p>
<p>上海金融混亂太深，距理想地步太遠，所以改進方法，也非一蹶可就，祇可按需要的緩急，分別設施，積極推進，乃能底於成·同時，改進設施，必須多方並進，標本兼治，更須爭取時間，邁步前進，以防金融大波動之再起。作者謹就管見所　，將急待改善者，提出辦法幾項，以供國人參考：</p>
<p>統一金融系統　過去的金融業，無論經營方法和作　　，都是相當的複雜，且程度也參差不一，業務又乏方針，　　計劃，各循其自然發展，致金融系統紊亂，金融力量分散，欲改善上海金融，首須從這混亂局面，統一金融系統，强化銀行制度，使於社會金融，能有調劑和控制的力量。第一，中央銀行雖已漸穩固了它應有的地位，但對今金融突變，和信用膨脹，尙感應付乏力，所以我們尙希進一步的改革和强化，使能負起確切的領導作用，以控制整個的上海金融。第二，目前銀行制度，雖有國營和民營之分，組織上具有分權形式，但業務範圍仍未能劃分，不免重複，非但不能收分工合作之效，尙妨礙其本身特殊業務之發展，致產業金融體制無法建立，金融系統之不完備，對今產業資本枯竭而商業資本膨脹的不良現象，遂亦無法調整而改善，所以今後國家銀行應速放棄普通銀行業務的經營，各在本位上努力，互不競爭，通力合作，以穩固金融的力量。</p>
<p>（二）改善銀行業務銀行業務的不當，實亦爲上海金融混亂的促成因素，所以對於業務方面，也不容它再因循苟且，須力求改善。但銀行業務的所以不得正當發展，亦有其促成因素，諸如資力的薄弱，業務的狹窄，利息負擔的過重，和投炎途徑的缺乏等，而此尤以淪陷時期爲甚，且至今亦尙未能有所改善，仍徬徨於歧途，此種現象，非但妨礙金融的安定，且於銀行業本身，亦有害而無益，是以今後宜積極的改革，使能適言戰後建設的需要，乃可立足於新時代的環境，第一，銀行須確立健全的營業方針，和訂定周密的計劃，使營業展開，有所遵循·第二，改善內部組織，並提高服務效率，以消除淪陷時期人民對銀錢業的不良影響。第三，擴大活動範圍，以改善目前塵集上海一地，而苦金融資金無出路之弊。第四，努力於信用制度之發展，使能增加存款，擴充業務。第五，應引導社會利率之降低，以减輕成本。第六，在今之際，銀行的貸款政策，有重加厘訂的必要，爲求對產業復員的扶助，和自身業務的擴張，銀行應採兼營制度，除對短期商業信用的調劑外，應積極參加對工業的貸放，不過工貸的性質不同，宜以可用的固定資力爲限。第七，銀錢業應停止自營投機，和對投機者的接濟。第八，銀行應减少對地產的投資，而應另闢投資途徑，投資於正當企業。上述各項，雖須銀錢業的自我改善，但自我改善是不够的，尙須當局的積極監督和提倡。</p>
<p>（三）建立炎本市塲　上海沒有資本市塲，素爲識者所　，致金融與產業無法連繫，民問游資沒有歸宿，影響所及，爲害匪淺。在戰前雖亦有證券市塲，買買公債和外股，在淪陷期間，又有華股市塲的勃起，但此種市塲盡爲投機所籠罩，而喪失證券市塲創設的本意。而今勝利以後，市塲停國，遂起黑市，黑市活動，乏正軌可循，更易爲大戶所操縱，致波動之大，殊屬空前，當局雖有取締，然無補於實際。其莫若從速復業，使證券交易合理化，導游資於產業，對嚴重的游資問題，亦可得部份的解決。但對證券市塲的復業，須十分的審愼，切不可再蹈過去的覆轍，徒增投機的塲所，其應切實的改進，使能成爲正式的資本市塲。第一，華股，公債和外股三市，應合併開拍，以利管理。第二，對上市的股票，應嚴加審查，以免信用不良的充斥，和籌碼的惡性膨脹，藉以保障投資者的安全，以養成對投資的習慣。第三，嚴格規定上落的範圍，以增强穩定股價的力量，第四，改善股票的發行方法，建立擔保承銷商的中間機構，以强化股市的組織。第五，　　　　　券的發行，以利產業資金的充裕。第六，公債暴漲，　　　　　　公債，旣能增加債市的籌碼，免爲投機者的操縱，復可吸收一部的游資。</p>
<p>（四）恢復交易所上海的市塲，除此證券市塲之外，尙有標金，外匯和外幣的金融市塲，與食糧，紗布等的物品市塲，自勝利以後，亦相繼停頓，致一切交易，陷入黑市，未能納入正軌，巨大的波動，其害較諸證券黑市爲允烈。所以交易所政策已不能不從速決定，况今外匯市塲開放後，爲求匯價的穩定，更須金融和物價的安定了。第一，在今游炎問題無法澈底解決，投機無法根滅之際，金融當局又已重用黃金政策，則標金市塲應速即恢復，使游資再流入黃金上去，而政府得以合理的控制，這也是對游資暫時穩定的一法，且較操縱黑市，易於奏效。第二，物品市塲也應從速恢復，使物品交易合理化，市價波動有一定的範圍，正常工商乃可從事規則的交易，於是工商方面的游資亦可有所歸宿了。</p>
<p>金融的穩定，雖須賴於通貨膨脹的終止，但通貨的收縮，通貨流通率的緩和，亦須有健全的金融制度，乃可易於推進。上述四項，雖多老生常談，但實爲當前所急待解決的，如能切實做到，則現階段的金融問題，不難迎刃而解，立拯於混亂之中，且於金融本身亦能有若干的改觀，而趨健全性。金融系統的統一，銀行業務的改善，都是金融機稱上的基本問題，乃可增强對整個金融的控制力量。資本市塲的建立，交易所的復業，非但爲金融繁榮的必由途徑，且游資問題暫時亦可賴以解決，更可作中央銀行公開市塲政策運用的據點。上述四端，尙是我們對上海金融改進的最低要求，將來的更進一步的興革，便可由此爲起點。總之，今後的上海金融，必須以新的姿態出現於戰後經濟，乃能究成所應負的艱巨責任和使命。呈請平賣接收物資</p>

<h3>日本天皇　應列為戰犯之一　日反戰同盟領袖鹿地亘發表見解</h3>
<p>— 本報記者蒼龍</p>
<p>「日本的天皇，應該列為戰犯之一，他對這次的戰禍，應負最大的責任，因為天皇對這次的戰禍，有絕對控制的權力，可是他不設法制止……日本戰時的不幸和肌餓，都是天皇制度給予帶來的，所以天皇制度紹對慼該廢除，不過處理慼該慎重……」。</p>
<p>昨天下午六點鎮光景，一羣記者團，擠滿了大中華飯店四樓的一問斗室，圍住剛從重慶飛來的日本反戰同盟領袖鹿地亘氏，（見圖），問題像聯珠似的向他發射。當談話的重心移到天皇制度時，他毫不猶疑地發表了這段見解。他熊度的沉着，談鋒的刻劃入骨，正顯示着他反戰意旨的堅強。他說日本人民經過這文的戰禍後，已深切地感到民主的需要，佔計日本人民百分之六七十，都贊成民主，只要他們能團結起來，應該可以達到日本的民主和平，所以深信日本民族，此後必能變成的日本，葬送到殘垣碎死堆裏去，可是鹿地亘要在這上面培柏起新日本民主的蓓　來，他趕着回去做一番耕耘工作對預定於本年四月十日舉行的大選，鹿地氏認為時問稍嫌迫促，他深怕日本人民對選舉的準備不夠，很着望能夠把時問延長一下，他更深望在民主的大前提下，日本各政黨慼共同聯絡，對競選固應該多多淮備，然而彼此不該有無譯的攻擊！談到中日兩國間未來的關係，鹿地氏說：中日兩國都是大民族，再加上印度，印度尼西亞等民族，人口已佔全世界的半數。所以就是沒有東亞中日兩大民族的和平，那夫東亞和平的解放，必不可能。過去日本少數的侵略主義者，和特權階階級，把中日問的民族關係打破了，現在應談把它再番的聯擊起來，使將來對文化敎育技術各力面，都有圓滿的關係和基礎，來實現中日國民主政府問的關係！記者不禁問起他對中國的影像來，他奕奕有神的一雙眼睛，閃動了一下，露出了一檢的笑容說：「中國是我生命的恩人，對這次柬亞的解放戰，我能參加，實感無上光榮。中國有四萬五千萬的人民，是一個偉大的民族。中國的前途，是充滿着希望的，必能為東亞創造一個新時代。中國的幸福，足以影響到東亞的幸福，也足以影響到日本的幸福」！八年來鹿地亘跟中國的抗戰，始終站在一條戰綫　上，對日本展開反戰的宣傳，民國二十七年至二十八年間，那時反戰同盟還沒成立，他曾到過湖南和重慶一帶的日俘收容所，宣傳了一番，這一階段的工作，他搜集起來，完成了一本報告文學，到「和平邨記」。二十八年十二月二十五日，反戰同盟成立，他擔任了鎮袖，又帶了七個日本工作問志，到華南一帶工作，那時日軍正進攻南寗，他們跟中國的軍隊出入火綫，積極對日展開反戰宣傳，工作經過，都收藏在一本「我個七個人」的集子裹。三十三年間，又在湖南常德，和湖北宜昌一帶，跟中國軍隊活動，對日軍實傳經過，每天都有通訊寄到重慶，收拾起來，集成一本「火綫通訊」。以上不過是他服務於戰時中國的一些犖犖大者，可是在沒來華前，他在日本因為常常參加一些社會主義信徒們的集會，所以在民國十七年至二十四年的一階段裹，被捕入獄達二十六次之多！記者末了為了他榮任麥帥的政治顧問，向他祝賀。他說：這方面的消息，他是於去年九月得自中國的外交部，但迄目前為止，還沒得到麥帥正式的指令。這次和他同機飛滬的，有他的夫人池四幸子，兩個孩子，四位工作人員。可是不幸的狠，昨天上午，他四歲的小孩子，攀在他所寓的四樓小室窗口眺望，一不小心，掉到了街心，跌傷了頭，十一時送到仁濟醫院，已經沒知覺，就滬樣的斷送了一個孩子！可是，鹿地亘接見記者時，在他臉上，找不到半絲傷感。他心裏正燃燒着一把創造民主新日本的火炬，這火的光輝和熱烈，足以掩蓋他魯鬥八年來所遭受的一切舊創新痕！</p>

<h3>黑市買戶減减少　金價逐步下挫　新老港票均回好</h3>
<p>烚赤昨初穩後疲，中行仍以一六二萬原價配售五九五條，供源較暢，出路又感不易推銷，美國金價問題，經本報詳細解釋後，人心亦漸轉定，午後更見軟弱，晨開時即微挫，在一六五萬左右，此價尙不堪持久，逐漸小挫，中行配售時，市價較高少許，登記者五九五條如數核准，一部份籌碼稍感充沛，此後黑市中買戶較少活動，於是顯形萎靡，游資熱迫冷藥，午刻已破入一六〇萬關內，午後見一五八萬，浮多始吿肅淸，最後仍屈居一六關內，結果較前收回小六萬五，銀樓飾金掛一七三〇〇〇元，紋銀一六〇〇元，銀元平穩，暗拆息價一角八至三角二分，中行管制合理，投機商對今市裹足不前，放棄者日多，起仆範圍勢將更爲狹窄。</p>
<p>外幣美鈔呆滯萬分，金市步跌，午後亦連帶趨疲，晟開二〇三〇元有賣，在二〇一〇元光景掙扎極久，午刻已退入二〇〇〇元關，結果回降四十元，港票老貨仍受港電所帶俏，結果再好五元，新貨初時平疲，在前收價盤旋，午後始稍帶上，結果三六年好起三元，三七年好二元，美匯未更，港電四六元，羅比五六〇元，仍有結款。</p>
<h3>公債大勢趨疲　華股止跌轉漲</h3>
<p>公債昨意興闌珊，無甚變化，熟門丙種僅一百餘元起仆，中途由堅而疲，結果各債小挫三十元至五十元，華股止跌轉漲，游資苦無出路，當局頒布之儲蓄銀行法，規定生產事業之有價證券，應佔準備百分之四十，市况又漸向上，但業中人爲準備前日所進外股交割，（外股採隔日交割）仍有大量了結，都爲業外游資吸收，於是由低逐漸盤好，渦程則永紗較美亞遜色甚多，午妝結果較前收計永紗好五十元，美亞一百元，景福三小熱各好五元至七元不等，午後隔日交割者，喊價扳高，永紗三九〇〇元，美亞三〇五〇元，景福二三五元以上，外股熱門初開尙穩，怡紗在八一〇〇元以上，惟不久即被多頭推出存貨所遏止，大股高後回挫半成結束，小股鋼業紙業因隔前晚盤喊高頗多，漲後雖有問跌，但較前尙好一成。</p>
<h3>中英滙價</h3>
<p>路透三月十九日倫敦電，英蘭銀行證實，對華匯兌，尙無正式市價，塲外做開，每鎊爲滬幣五千五百五十元云。</p>
<h3>米價繼漲不已　民食問題嚴重</h3>
<p>米市天陰貨稀，店胃尙殷，粳秈米續加二千元，白元陰元再升二三千元，麵粉外銷不動，本街徠巧略進，價格堅挺，油市銷化頗活，續漲二千餘元，豆餅零銷甚活，再升三四百元，麩皮內地帮去路活潑，市形穩固，黃豆趨勢平庸。</p>
<p>又訊，據本市米市塲息，昨口食米到貨共七·一〇一石，其種類如下，白粳三·〇三〇石，羊秈七五石，百元六〇石，薄稻一·八九一石，杜秈四五三石，險元一八石，早稻一。五七四石。台灣茶到千餘件</p>
<h3>救濟署運麥赴津</h3>
<p>台灣茶到千餘件</p>
<p>太古公司山東輪，今午駛津，計裝去救濟署小麥一萬六千餘包，另有茶葉七千件，係商貨，合灣有茶葉運來，海蘇輪昨自台到滬，裝來一千九百餘件，江建輪由甌甬來滬，昨晨進口，該輪由溫裝來大批木板外，又有土糖六百餘包。</p>
<h3>紗價步降　現棉交易尚暢</h3>
<p>昨日紗市急轉直下，晨初在一片賣出聲中，逐步降落，雙馬一度迫近百萬，十六支光明亦降至八十萬邊近，的較上日跌至七八萬，人心仍疲，緣布廠織廠之製成品亦感滯銷也，紡建公司昨開售花色棉布共九種，又美國布十一種，今日開售蔴呢製品云。</p>
<p>昨日紐約美棉報漲十二至十五磅音，計近期美金二六·七五，遠期二六·五四，米特林現貨二七·三四，本埠現棉市况平疲，惟交易甚暢，紡建公司接收日商之紗廠，需川棉花孔亟，又起採辦米特林彰德花巴西花等細絨原料，二千六七百包，申新紗廠續進三餘鎭海提尖七八百包云。</p>
<h3>善救總署配給棉　中國得五一萬包</h3>
<p>〔路透社紐約十九日電〕據華爾街日報稱：聯合國善後救濟總署爲救濟受戰事損失各國而購買之棉花，約計八十四萬六千包，共中的三萬五千包係印度所供給。照聯總分配計　，以中國配得之數量為最大，的計五十一萬包</p>
<h3>白鉛絲稍見轉機</h3>
<p>自鉛絲自上月中旬新貨到埠應市後，行情逐步下降，歷三週餘，未見起色，迨至輓近，始稍現轉機，硬性更受顯咨歡迎，因其爲數較少之故，近日市價八號十號每担售八萬元，十二號十四號售九萬元，十六號售十二萬元，細花色如二十號每担需二十萬元，至于硬性則較上開價格約遞加二三成不等。</p>
<h3>柏油銷塲平淡</h3>
<p>柏油因天雨兼句，燭淘銷塲大爲减色，影響柏油去路，殊非淺鮮，雖小型皂廠略有添辦，然所取均是二三等貨品，高等貨如禾本內坪等油，均惑呆滯，幸上等油來源不多，故表面雖似少神，內容尙稱堅固，且以各種油類而諭，柏油獨廉，一旦春銷發動，前途希望甚大，惟近來鐵路運費頓增三倍，成本又加起不少，售盤亦不得不隨之而增，茲將行家批價列后，計禾本五萬八千元，內坪五萬元，闌尖四萬六千元，普通闌油四萬二三千元。</p>
<h3>白煤屑及烟煤　市價愈盤愈小</h3>
<p>煤市僅白煤　塊及小子煤穩站原盤，白煤屑及烟煤各貨承前趨勢，同業人心繼續看低，故市塲初開即爲賣風籠罩，市價步步盤低，傾跌不已，柴炭目前因雨到貨仍稀，市况堅挺，預料今後天晴風順，到貨必旺，市價難免劇烈回降。</p>
<h3>燒碱大瀉　工業原料湧到</h3>
<p>本市工業原料，枯竭已久，最近先有卜內門進到燒碱漂精等一批，繼有美商由馬尼刺啓運來滬之各種工業原料，數址雖不甚多，然一般原料商與囤戶，心呈虛軟，因此其已到埠未卸之貨及尙在途中之所謂短期拋貨，紛紛爭先拋售，致價格一致傾瀉，近日市塲美貨燒碱竟有二十五萬一桶做出者，較前週市價僅四分之一，他如漂粉鋅氣粉肥田粉等居奇貨物，亦一落千丈，聞美商出口原料，因船期及成本尙無確實計算，故滬紐問之五六月份定貨尙難成交。</p>
<h3>茶商貸款　四聯滬分處　核准廿餘億元　與申請額相差尚鉅　茶業協會籌備就緒</h3>
<p>茶為我國出口土產大宗，茲因茶期迅屆，關於教購運輸等問題，曾經茶業界各團體分電向二中全會，蔣主席請求扶助，以便復興中國茶業，爭取國際貿易，頃據農業經濟學家（茶業鉅子）孫曉村氏云，廿三家茶商向四聯總處上海分處申請收購貸款，以存茶·黃金·房地產爲抵押品，申請總額達四十二億元，業經四聯總處上海分處例會討論，惟四聯方面希望純以存茶抵押，雖經通過，然核准總數僅廿餘億元，業由四聯分處呈請總處核示中，然爲數極小，與目前全國所亟需貸款額一千億元，相差甚鉅故近尙在積極進行申請中。又悉：各茶商為謀復興我國茶葉，發展國外貿易，協助政府經濟建設，業經茶業界鉅子壽景偉·吳覺農·葉世昌·汪振寰·孫曉村諸氏發起組織中國茶業協會，經籌備員二度聯席會議，籌備大致就緒，近日正公開徵求會員，茲聞內定四月一日在滬舉行成立大會，今後全國茶商將有一健全統一組織，並悉將參加本年度秋季在英國倫敦舉行之戰後第一次世界茶葉展覽會。</p>
<h3>洋行接受定貨　美製紗機大進步　四十萬紗錠已定妥</h3>
<p>美英等國之戰時工業，多已移轉至一般生產製造工業，在短時期內機器又有出口，故英美在華之洋行，近漸活躍，並已開始接收訂貨，聞在滬工業機械成交較大者，爲紡織機械，如美商之衛立韓愼昌，英商之安利平和，均各有訂貨出售，美造紡紗機以製造技術進步，機件構造，過程簡便，新穎靈活，其進步點是將牽伸改爲大牽伸，精紡機之鋼領亦放大至二吋與二吋四分，組紡部份，其過程原爲三道，現僅用一道則可上精紡機，此項新式紡機，生產量較十年前之各式紡機可增產量百分之廿（以紡廿支紗爲標準，則一錠每廿四小時可產紗一·二磅）人工之節省當較前式的减一半，（前式機每萬錠需直接人工三百名，新機祇需一百五十名）聞英國之紡織專家近多赴美考察以資借錢，因美造紡機有上列各種優點，售價亦較英造機器為高，每一萬錠（清花·鋼絲·併條·粗紡·精紡全套）價為四十五萬元美金，十個月交貨（此為訂購外機交貨最速者）運費及保險等項槪由購方負擔，英造紡機價値較廉，每一萬錠爲八萬至九萬鎊不等，但交貨期間約需三十個月始能起裝，至於訂購手續英美各商均多相仿，訂購方首向各該行簽訂訂購約據後，即履行條約辦理，訂的時先付訂金百分之十五，開始製造時付百分之廿五，製造完成試車裝箱後付百分之六十。</p>
<p>瑞士銳特紡紗機製造廠，在滬亦有代理行，可接收訂貨，但以交貨時間尙不能確定，故乏購主　在印度經營紡織機器業之英印行家，近亦有代表來滬兜售留印之舊式紡機，售價較新式機器稍廉，聞本市已有數廠與之洽商，短期或可簽字成交。查我國各大紡織企業，近半年來向美英各行訂購者達四十餘萬紗錠，其中以申新所購者爲多，約十七萬錠，豫豐紗廠及裕華系統各廠訂購亦不少，現在接洽中者日益動躍，據某紡織專家謂，是項舊型紡機產量旣弱，又耗人工，美英新機運華，大量裝置後</p>
<p>三五年年內勢將變成廢鐵，故訂　廠商宜愼重考慮云。</p>

<h3>杭市師範校　一塲全武行</h3>
<p>飛石擊破校長頭部</p>
<p>〔本報杭州訊〕杭市師範學校，昨日（十七）下午四時發生大風潮，綠前日下午該校校務會議席上，討論舊欠敎師公糧及新繳學生膳食問題時，該校校畏朱文治，堅持舊欠敎師公糧不發，新繳學生膳費續加。全體敎師皆以是項舊欠公糧，旣經校方領到，自應照發，而學生膳費，以該校學生大多淸貧，不堪負担，應遵照部令未便擅加，遂引起激辯。最後因朱校長態度驕傲，遂與敎師當塲口角，不歡而散，會議亦無結果。及至昨已下午四時，該校將晚餐時，朱校長召集全體學生訓話，言語中似欠合情理，當有學生登台辯廠，不料辯駁甫罷，而不幸之全武行發生。朱校長頭部竟遭飛石擊破，訓育主任當時急以手代掩其頭，而手上血痕斑斑。朱校長見勢不佳，急乘隙走出。該校學生急召開自治會緊急會議，已於昨起，實行罷課，若不合理解決，擬不復課。並開朱校長因頭部受傷，旋即赴省立醫院醫治，一面報請敎育應派員澈查云。（　）</p>
<h3>私立中學設立標準　基金須足敷經常開支　較戰前所定標準不同</h3>
<p>〔本報南京訊〕在抗戰以前，敎部對各省市私立學校之設立，所規定資產資金（基金）標準，因彼時生活程度低，物價穩定，曾酌定數額，例如五萬十萬，存儲銀行，經查騐相符，即准設立。在抗戰期間，因生活程度加高，物價波動不定，各地生活水準難期一致，未能定一整齊劃一之敎育基金數額，乃規定一種原則，由各省市敎育廳局，視各地情形，根據原則，自訂標準，以期適合，而免困難。其原則維何，即是凡請求設立私立中學者，必須其所有資產及資金（即敎育基金）之正常生息，足數該校經常費之用者，方准設立。項敎部表示：各地生活情形不同，物價又時有變更，故資產及資金之數額，亦隨時代有所增益，由當地敎育行政當局，依部定上述原則，分別釐訂足敷學校經當開支之標準云。（愚）與救濟分會合辦</p>

<p>敎育論文</p>
<h3>評小學圖畫科課程標準</h3>
<p>— 溫肇桐</p>
<p>敎育部在民國廿五年七月公布「修正小學美術課程標準」，當時我曾經發表過一篇檢討的文章，登在江蘇省小學敎師半月刋四卷五期上面，提出它的特點有：（一）從鄕土出發，（二）儘量發展兒童的創造能力，（三）以日常生活的應用爲歸宿。最近看到卅一年十月公布的「小學圖書科課程標準」，於是把它與前者比較，似乎發現了中國小學美術敎育的退步現象，這也是引起我寫這篇文章的動機。</p>
<p>在這次修訂經過中說；「小學課程爲小學全部敎育設施之中心，包括整個兒童生活之敎導，並非狹義的某一科的敎育」。又說：「根據上項課程之定義，國民敎育小學部之課程，可分析爲三大訓練：（一）道德的訓練，（二）身體的訓練，（三）知能的訓練。即小學整個敎育之設施，應以德體智三大訓練爲中心目標」。因之，便將「美術」改爲「圖畫」而納入於「知識技能方面」了。</p>
<p>大前提旣然是這樣確定了，圖畫課程便成爲下面的內容：</p>
<p>（一）注重技術的訓練；</p>
<p>（二）重視基本的練習；</p>
<p>（三）取消硏究的作業；</p>
<p>（四）蔑視生活的美化。</p>
<p>爲着篇幅的經濟，內容方面，我不想具體地把它摘錄出來，可是我始終有幾個疑問：在敎材大綱關於基本練習的一項中第三四學年第三項竟規定「用畫帖編成最基木畫法」，不是要陷於臨摹的危險呢？</p>
<p>其次，敎學要點中，還規定「繪畫的基本練習，應在低年級開始訓練」。這樣實施，要低年級的兒童就要畫得正確，純熟，不但違背了學習心理，進一步的要問：這樣的訓練，每一個國民可能都成爲技術熟練的畫家，結果確是）種浪費。</p>
<p>小學美術敎育的目的到底是什麼？假使只要訓練繪畫的技術，那麽這次修訂公布的「圖畫科課程標準」或者是比較合理的，可是，我們要求於每一個兒童的，是有一付辦別美醜的眼睛，一種美化生活的本領，至於創造力的發展，畢兌是次要的地位，而且，單有刻板的基本技術的練習，反而會遏止自出發表，自由創造的能力。</p>
<p>如果根據這樣的標準來實施，很可能把人類愛美的天性，審美的興趣，完全沮喪，消滅，死板的畫匠的養成，對整個國民敎育起什麼作用？最後，我的主張，中高年級是應該恢復「美術」，低年級是應該恢復「工作」，以擴大作業範圍，最好還應該把「勞作」中含有美術性的生活工藝歸併過來，成爲一個完整的「造形敎育」體系，以「培養欣賞」「發展創造」等爲手段，而使每一個國民都能改善自己的生活以趨於美化。我是竭力反對技術訓練，特別從低年級開始實施。因爲「繪畫技術」決不是現代美術敎育的核心，離「生活課程」，「行爲課程」也很遠，與其把「圖畫」作爲「知識技能方面」的訓練，還不如恢復「美術」而作爲「道德行爲方面」的訓練的好。</p>

<h3>端納對談　本報記者　中國踏上轉捩點　應該把大門打開</h3>
<p>「端納先生不見客」。</p>
<p>宏恩醫院「寫字間」里的一位小組這樣告訴我。我對她說：我是記者，商納先生不是昨天就接見了新聞記者嗎？</p>
<p>她笑起來，說「但是他「今天」不見客」。</p>
<p>我說，我要試試。她說我可以到三樓雲碰碰運氣。</p>
<p>三樓第三百號病　的門鈕上掛着一塊紙牌，紅墨水寫着兩個大字：「No　Vnaitoro」！</p>
<p>我想：反正碰釘子也沒有關係，還是試試看。一位中國看護小姐正好從病房里出來，我就要她爲我遞一張名片進去。她說：「醫院的零亂，正午兩點到四點才能會客，我看你還是正午來罷」。</p>
<p>碰釘子也沒關係　運氣終頭</p>
<p>她終於把我的名片送進去了。出來的時候，她說：「端納先生可以見你」。</p>
<p>端納先生躺在高高的牀上，背後用枕頭整得很高。他穿着一件灰色對襟的毛線衫，面色相當紅潤，眼鏡片後的一雙鷹眼閃閃有光。面前小几上放着一杯熱氣騰騰的咖啡，一杯清水，一些白紙，一支鉛筆。紙上潦潦草草地已經寫不不少。被　上散着兩份英文報。房間里暖氣融融，端納先生似乎很愉快的樣子。</p>
<p>他說：「今天深得會有舒服多了。昨天我真疲倦——真是疲倦了。飛行的路程並不能算長，飛機上也非常舒適，不過，我的……」他輕輕撫了一下他的左胸，咳起嗽來。這咳嗽就是他這病症的症象。他說：「早就想來了。到了上星期五才掙扎着起了床，夜間八點鍾上的飛機」。</p>
<p>他顯然已經讀到了報上蔣夫人要專機來看他的消息，提起就滿足的微笑起來。他非常想見一見主席，但是，他喃喃地說，「主席——他太忙了」。</p>
<p>中國一路順利嗎　端納不敢說</p>
<p>談到了中國目前的情形，他興奮地說：「我到了中國四十三年，每一天都渴望着看見一個自由的中國。現在總算看見了，真覺得安慰！中國當前的機會是千載難逢的，可是就要說是一路順利嗎？我不敢說。中國正到了一個轉捩點，它可以說此成爲一個強盛繁榮的國家，但它也還不是沒有挫敗的可能。最要緊的是執政者必須有眼光。如果我是中國的執政者，目前要做的事情是很簡單的：不要懷偏狹的成見，把大門打開。中國必須要靠外資！要靠外國人爲你做事，你應該給他們一點好處，讓他們安安心心的做生意賺錢」。</p>
<p>華昌公司李國欽在美著勞蹟</p>
<p>他又說：「美國初創的時候，也曾吸收外國的財力，美國最初的鐵路是英國商人投資的！我在美國長長長島（Long　Lsland），看見有一座高高的建築，上面寫着極大的中國字：「華昌貿易公司」，經理叫李國欽他們有自己的工廠，規模宏大，在整個戰爭期內，單獨負担了美國政府委託辦理的一切　的生産。他們當然可以有利潤，而且有很大的利潤，但是他們也幫助了美國政府，美國人是感謝他們的。中國必需也要　　批的這種外國商人，才能解決目前的困難，才能使民衆享受更好的生活。現在還能抱當年義和國他們那樣狹隘的排外觀念嗎？」他激動地緊握雙拳，用一個演說似的姿勢，說：「你們進步一些的年青記者們，應當認識得清楚一點，該說話的時候，要說：應當爭的地方，就該爭！」</p>
<p>他劇烈的咳嗆着，但是眼光中燃燒着熱情火焰，使他忽然見得年青起來。</p>
<p>正在著述回憶錄　愈寫而愈難</p>
<p>我問他沙萊和他寫回憶錄的事情。他說：「沙萊也是記者，我之認識他，也就爲了他來訪問我。四十三年來，我的確記得不少事情，但有一大半實情，都是非守秘密不可的。在檀香山，三個醫生告訴我：我不會好了。但是，即使——」他頓了一頓，頺喪地說：「我還是不能說。這本書，寫是是現在已經寫了一大半，可是愈寫愈難，恐怕不見得能夠完成了。」</p>
<p>我們談起了西安事變。我說：「你在那一次實在是一個英雄」。他笑起來，說：「張學良的確不是一個壞人，現在，應當是可以讓他出來的時候了！」</p>
<p>我告辭的時候，他的握手堅定有力，他向我道謝的聲音也還是宏亮的，簡直不像患着重病的人。我知道他在掙扎——這個永遠不肯示弱的老人！</p>
<p>護士告訴我，現在負責爲他診治的醫生，一位是德爾範的女醫師勃魯門菲　（Miss　Blumenfield），一位是以前南京中央醫院的外科專家陳宗謨。端納先生精神很好，可是吃得很少，祇吃麵包麥片和一點湯。我想以後我再來的時候，她們恐怕不會再說：「端納先生不見客」了。</p>
<h3>聯合國善後部署秘書長蒙翁尼在杭州</h3>
<p>— 本報杭州十日航訊　盛澄世寄</p>
<p>舉國熱鬧之善後救濟，在聯總行總合作下，巳漸次開展，聯合國善後救濟部署執行秘書長蒙翁年氏（Mooney），適奉聯總李蒙署長之命，視察歐亞二洲。蒙氏在歐洲觀察完畢於上月二十六日飛抵上海踏上了亞洲的第一個國家。三月四日的中午，滬杭快車載着這位遠道的佳賓，首先蒞臨浙閩區的杭州。當火車停靠月台後。車廂里走下一位四十多歲中等身材臉龐胖胖的加拿大人，他就是代表聯總來援助我國萬千難胞的蒙翁年先生。他帶來了聯合國人民的熱情，來慰問我們在苦難中受災八年的浙江二千萬同胞。</p>
<p>義民運送站內　孩子唱歡迎歌</p>
<p>他在杭僅二天的逗留，曾參加行總與聯總的工作會報，盾到雙方緊密聯繋合作的精神，頗爲滿意。在視察義民運送站時，細細地察看站內食宿實況，受養在站內的孩子們，合唱了「中華萬歲」及「美國是我們的好朋友」，二支歌曲，來歡迎這位佳賓。渠於視察各平售麵粉門售處及其他善救工作後，往省府拜會黃主席代表他秘書長及市府周市長，對省市當局能協同推展善救工作，表示十分欣慰。李秘書長特別提出搶修海塘和修復長興煤礦二件事，求助於聯總。蒙氏謂海塘決親往查勘，煤礦方面接到計劃書後，在機器人員方面，均可幫忙。蒙氏又參觀了本省的二大建設—錢江大橋與閘口電廠。</p>
<p>一篇物資清單　允予盡量接濟</p>
<p>在一次午宴席上，蒙氏談到上月杭市因米荒而發生搗毀米店的事。他說：「在風潮後的二三天，浙閩分署即從上海運來大師麵粉，立刻舉辦平售，這敏捷的及進救濟，將第袋九千餘元的麵粉瀉跌到六千五百元。由於無數貧民的受惠，穩定了人心，這正是我們從事善救工作者，所祈求達到的目的的」。他又說：「在華盛頓未動身到中國以前，聯總及一般美國人士的見解，都以爲中國農業落後，化學肥料一定不曾施用，把化學肥料運到中國，覺得是浪費物資。經過聯總與行總及農業專家的多方證明後，始知這種觀念是錯誤的」。他要　　聯總將大師的化學肥料運助中國。蒙氏態度的坦白爽直，感人至深。可憤他不能巡視全浙，否則對浙閩災情，可得更深切的瞭解。好在孫署長巳向他提交了兩省需要的一大篇救濟物資清單，蒙氏　允　　救濟。</p>
<p>滬杭公路沿線　勘察海塘工程</p>
<p>他返滬的時候，爲了要看看海塘及將來運送物資的公路，六日晨乘坐「吉普卡」循滬杭公路駛滬，沿途勘察海寗，海鹽，乍浦，一帶海塘搶修工程，這個有關東南人民生存的海塘，在未來杭州前，就深印在他腦子里，我們車經海寗等地下車巡視，總計沿途缺口有十二個之多，小的就有半里長，頂大的有六里多。蒙氏仔細勘察，在刻有千字文「旦」字的石碑附近，攝影多幀，那里也是一個大缺口。</p>
<p>不該說是救濟　應稱之曰還債</p>
<p>車中蒙氏又提到這次我國在整個反法西斯戰爭中的貢獻，他說：「犧牲之重，聯合國中任何一國，都無可與中國比擬的，可是中國人民還在忍受着痛苦，埋頭復興的工作，並不向聯總大肆聲求，這偉大的精神太使人感動了」。「加拿大的女子們大聲疾呼說：爲了犧牲得連絲襪也沒有穿了，非請聯總大量援助不可，其實中國的女人，不僅無絲襪可穿，大多還赤着腳呢！」他揮着拳頭繼續說：「所以我這次覺得聯總對中國的援助，不說救濟，該說是還債」。他又欣奮地說：「浙江是偉大領袖蔣主席的故鄉，我們爲崇敬主席，與他領導下的人民，應得把主席的故鄉—浙江！使他恢復得更美麗些。」</p>
<p>救濟總署年會　明春在華舉行</p>
<p>吉普車行駛在泥濘不平的滬杭公路上，在戰前僅四小時半的行程，我們竟化去了十二個鍾頭，到上海巳晚上八時了。如橋樑路面不加改善，行車甚爲危險，在目前想利用這公路去運送大師物資，恐怕還不可能。抵滬握別的時候，蒙氏笑著對記者說：「我愛慕西湖，請代向黃主席李秘書長周市長致意，日後我還想再來看看美麗的西湖！」又轉過頭來拍拍行　顧專員及分署長主任的肩膀說：「你們的署長當然也要幫你們爲我致謝的！」我們互道後會有期，因爲聯合國救濟總署的年會，可能於明春在我國舉行，屆時蒙氏將重蒞我國。</p>
<h3>即靜且動的錦城</h3>
<p>— 本報七日航訊　周泱泉寄</p>
<p>（翠綠鮮紅）成都，她是一座美麗而又安靜的城市。凡是到過成都的人，他自會有此同感。成都，她有着北平的氣魄，又具備江南的嫵媚。你如果不信，可以登上西城牆。縱目遠眺，你可以看到城內一帶的青蔥樹木，到處夾着雪白的李花，鮮豔的紅梅，所有的樓台房舍，都在翠綠鮮紅中　現。你可以看到城外一片茂密的麥隴，黃色的菜田，遠村疏落，如畫如詩。你曾很自然的讚頌這座綠化的城。</p>
<p>成都人的生活，真可稱爲極其安靜閒散的了，多少大小的茶社酒肆，都鬧着人滿之患？甚至有人可以從清早泡一壺花茶，在茶社里閒坐一整天而不隱去。又有多少人在春熙路上，商業塲里踱着慢步，參觀每一家店鋪，參觀每家店子里大小貨品，他（她）們無所事事的在送走時光。就如現在，雖然農曆新年早巳過去很多時光，但還有沒開門做生意的店！說也奇怪，今年春熙路和祠堂街一帶的店家，他們裝修門面，已經成爲風氣。一家修，家家修，所以今年的泥水木作，生意特別興隆，也許是因爲抗戰勝利了，他們正打算着長久之計吧！</p>
<p>（華西壩上）湘蓮國　的風，飄入了這平靜的城。在本月廿四日的上午，城南的華西壩上，從各方面集攏來千萬個青年，他們在悲壯激昂熱烈緊張中舉行空前盛大的集會，他們要求「還我東北河山」，要求「鐵血保衛華北」，要求「蘇聯遵守條約立刻由東北撤兵」。他們的目的純正，他們的要求簡單，他們的行動偉大。十時半，由廣塲出發，遊行示威。</p>
<p>（歌唱撤兵）他們的行列，長達數里，當經過一街一巷，夾道歡呼的民衆，是成千成萬，不分男女，不分老幼，都高呼着口號，都伸出拳頭，唱着臨時擬就的請蘇聯撤兵歌：　八年抗戰，終獲勝利，收復東九省，國民要力爭，蘇聯要迅速撤退，須遵守中蘇條約，維護中華民國領土完整，維護祖國主權領土要完整。　蘇聯撤退，蘇聯撤退，守信約，守信約；還我東北九省，還我東北九省，齊力爭，齊力爭。大隊的行列，在午後一時許，到達省府大門，他們申述了遊行的動機和目的，在良好的秩序下各自散去。這次不平凡的遊行，將整個錦城的人們搖醒。安靜的錦城顯得活動起來了。</p>
<p>（甘霖未降）入春以來，天氣晴和，近兩個月，甘霖未降，因之米價高漲，但還不及一日數漲的菜油價格。去年九月間，二百元可購得菜油一斤，但到現在，巳是幾何級數的飛漲。每斤非一千餘元不辦，有個時期竟然漲到一千四百元了。米價也從每雙計一千七百元漲到三千四百元了，其餘的物價，概可想見。再從安樂寺和正娛花園，可以以看到萬頭蹟動，門前街上排成二三百輛長蛇車的包車，他們主人在短短的幾小時中，可以一躍而爲千萬巨富，也可一九而爲負債千萬的赤貧。那個市塲，那個塲合，只嗅到人肉味，只嗅到摸紙幣的膻味，那個塲合是有很多的笑聲，但是有更多的哭聲。從上午八時到十二時的時光，那是人們最擁擠的一瞬，人們在鑽動，欺騙，驚惶，在一刻千變中生活。那里是各種交易的市塲，不是，人吃人的鬥殺驚嚇！日日如此，月月如此，使安靜的錦城，變得動起來了。</p>
<p>（銷金之窟）新西門二仙庵和青羊宮附近，那里每年一段的花會——實際是勸業會——　動　個　　和整個四川。從川南，川東，川西，川北，各地　　了大小手工業和各種的商業，他們分租地皮，出售他們的農産品和手工藝品，如南京的夫子廟，蘇州的觀前街，北平的天橋和上海的城隍廟，那里是人看人，人擠人的塲合，據說最初成立是各業互助觀摩的集會，但延到今天，是一處銷金窟了。從四面八方趕來的千萬個香客，千萬個男女老少，從祠堂街口特別增添幾十輛馬車，來迎送人們，來服務人們，近日還只是初期，已經是山陰道上大有人滿之患了。成都的人們，也最愛趕熱鬧，在這一個多月的花會期中，若是你不去會塲一次，準會被人們目爲可知的落伍者的。如此，安靜的錦城，就很快的又一次大動了。</p>
<h3>我國氣象事業步入長足進展階段</h3>
<p>— 本報重慶航訊　志偉寄</p>
<p>勝利以來，許多因戰爭需要而産生的機關，都相繼裁撤，同時亦有若干建設機關，正忙着計劃業務的開展，以便參加這偉大的建國工作。中央氣象局爲抗戰期內成立的機構，臨時局址就在重慶沙坪壩中央大學的近旁，高家花園，但其任務卻因建國大業之展開，而愈見繁重。蓋氣象事業爲探測大氣界情況，預測未來天氣的科學事業，其目的正與地質事業之探測地下寶藏海洋事業之探測水界者相似。由於天氣對於人生關係之密切，故氣象事業，不僅有關軍事，且爲國計民生建設所利賴，如農産之豐斂，海空交通之安全，以及民族健康等問題，無一不需要預知未來天氣之變化。</p>
<p>惟欲完成此項目的，非有集中管理的密佈測候，罔不爲功。我政府當局有鑒於此，故於三十年秋，設立中央氣象局，祇以在抗戰期間，國內多數測候所，陷於敵手，且交通梗阻，關於人才之調度，設備之補充，均未能合理辦到。</p>
<p>現在，該局最迫切之工作，爲調整全國測候所，統一標凖，集中管理。敵僞所辦者，均須收回，如上海外灘信號台，該局巳予接收，並改組爲上海氣象台，今後沿海一帶所發氣象情報，該台可以負責供應。台灣氣象事業，巳由福建省氣象局石延漢局長就近接管，照常工作。此外，華北及東北之氣象機構，亦正派妥員接收中。</p>
<p>我國氣象人才，原極缺乏，其於各地服務有年曆著勞績之氣象技術人員，現聞局方在不久之將來，均擬登記備用，並將分別調訓，灌輸新技術。（二月二十八日）</p>

<h3>全英建築師等精心擘劃　大倫敦即將實現</h3>
<p>［本報編譯室稿］倫敦實在太小了。倫敦的人口數與哥倫比亞相等。但面積卻祇　及哥倫比亞的五分之一。英國全部人口的六分之一，都擠在倫敦和它的郊。它不但是政府的所在地，而且還是全英最重要的港口，是全英工商業的樞紐，是全英最大的商埠，同時是學術與文化的中心。它是全英國的心臟，可是畸形發展得太厲害，似乎這個身體承受不起這個龐大的「心臟」了。</p>
<p>倫敦的發展　歷兩千千年過程</p>
<p>當初建築倫敦的時候，本來沒有想到它會成爲現在這樣一個近代化國家的中樞。它正像一個有機體，二千年來，慢慢成長，才變成了這樣一副面目。在紀元前五十五年，羅馬人來到英國的時候，這本來祇是凱爾德族土著的一片散漫的居住地。羅馬人造起了城牆，在這里建築起羅馬式的城市來，給了它一個名字，呌做「倫迪寗姆」（Londinium）。羅馬衰落，這城市便在撒克遜人的統治之下繁榮起來，城外也逐漸變得熱鬧了。到十六世紀，它已經成爲全歐洲首屈一指的商埠。一六六六年，城中大火，數理化盡付一炬，但是在幾年之內，又飛快地復興起來，一切建築都照舊樣，還是窄窄的街道，每家都有小小的院落。</p>
<p>一幅倫敦圖　巳如一隻蜘蛛</p>
<p>同時，倫敦正在飛速擴展，伊麗沙白女皇和其他君主也曾三令五申，想制止這個都市的膨大，可是一無效果。到十八九世紀時，倫敦延展到了鄰近的其他郡縣，它吞沒了許多小鎮小村，人口急劇增加，破了世界歷史上的紀錄。倫敦的居民沿着鐵路公路，盡量的建造房屋，倫敦的地圖，變得有些像一隻蜘蛛了。</p>
<p>一般有識之士都覺得這樣畸形擴展，實在不大妥當。他們認爲這個都市吸收了太多的人口。在美國這樣一個大地方，倫敦這樣大的城市，還不見得頭重腳輕，但是英國比美國小得多，這種發展就很快成爲一個問題。許多優良的田地上，都造了房子，英國人口稠密，本來大宗食糧，都需仰給國外，像這樣的犧牲大師耕地，實在損失太大了。</p>
<p>彎曲的小巷　變成了寬廣街道</p>
<p>誠然，倫敦之有今日，前人的草劃經營之功，不能抹煞。一六六六年大火之後，克里勞動保護朶夫.雷恩爵士，（Sir　Chrislopler　Wren）在城里建築了五十座教堂，尖塔巍峨，非常美觀。許多方塲也是世界各國首都所望塵莫及的。十九世紀初期，工程師納許（Nash），設計了不少街道，通到白金漢宮，美麗古雅，至今天還是倫敦一個特色。近百年來，馬路拓寬，破破舊舊的房子，也折除了不少，以前擁擠不堪的彎彎曲曲的小巷，現在巳變成寬廣的街道，兩旁也都是整齊可觀的巨廈了。</p>
<p>宮畔設貨棧　煙煤吹進住宅</p>
<p>然而，倫敦在英國既是這樣重要而且已經繁榮多年，土地的價值當然極高再也沒有一個人肯爲了把它重新設計，而置現實的情形於不顧。於是結果就成爲：宏麗的新式通衢的後面，往往便是破舊狹隘的小巷。皇宮的隣近往往會有工廠里的煤煙吹進來。雖然這種現象在歐洲各國，甚至美國，都相當普遍，但英國政府當局，尤其是在近年，卻已經深感到這種　猶雜處的情形，未免玷辱了大英帝國的首都。</p>
<p>遇炸最慘烈　正是重建良機</p>
<p>德國的炸彈，完成了和平時期想做而不肯做的工作。從一九四〇年冬季起始，五年以來，倫敦不斷地遭受了火箭燒夷彈，及其他炸彈的攻擊，許多史蹟和街衢成爲瓦礫。除掉東京和柏林之外，世界首都中蒙受轟炸之慘，實以倫敦佔首位。英國政府馬上抓住了這千載一時的良機，決心把這個大都市重新建築，重新計劃，重新決定對它將來發展時的管理辦法。</p>
<p>嶄新的姿態　將與世人想見</p>
<p>亞倍克龍比教授，在一九四四年擬定了計劃，著成專書，全英國的建築師和工程專家熱烈地研討起來。根據這個計劃，將要有一個中心區域，稱爲「倫敦城；四週一個較大區域稱爲「倫敦都」；再外面的一個區域則稱作「大倫敦」，眼見這二千年來的大教會，將要以全新的姿態出現在全世界人士的面前了。」（平譯）</p>
<h3>英國女科學家尼漢夫人　曾在嘉陵江畔矮屋中工作</h3>
<p>劍橋大學科學家尼德漢夫人，在華中英科學合作館服務兩載，業巳期滿返國，其夫尼德漢博士，即中英科學合作館館長。</p>
<p>英國文化協會所維持之中央社會整合館，高於重慶嘉陵江畔之山嶺，在此板條上都有白　之矮屋中，曾經通過無數科學新　範，雜誌，翻印本，一箱箱儀器化學品，一包包特殊種籽與幼苗，以及在英國與鯿特地爲戰時渴望資料之中國科學家準備之材料，同時亦有中國科學家研究工作之報告以及農業上之材料，經過此屋，到達英國，供科學家之用。</p>
<p>中英科學合作館之工作，並不限於重慶。全體職員均乘卡車，長途跋涉，訪問疏數區中各大學與科學機關。尼德漢夫婦與二位中國青年科學家，前偕同重慶北上數千公里，到達陝甘兩省。途中遇泛濫　僑，以致一度放棄卡車，涉水至附近山丘。</p>
<p>至陝西寶雞，尼德漢夫婦一行，見到不少嚴有科學教授之事物，例如：十五年前創立於開封之河南大學，受日人侵擾，巳遇難四次之多，該校於寶雞二村荘寺院中授課，教授與沈重則數居於附近農家或山溝中。該校曾由苦力第二步數百哩，搬來數箱儀器，然乏摥所開闢實驗室。藏書中，無一本科學書範，因所有科學藏書，均巳毀於日人之手。師生衣物，亦巳犧牲一空，故均衣服夏度冬，各人盼望能得一件錦衣之救濟。勝利後，消息傳來，知校舍損毀頗多，交通困難，復校深感棘手，戰時之熱望，至此遂成泡影。</p>
<p>尼德漢夫婦此行，曾北抵甘肅省農林部之土壤保護所，此處工作甚佳。此外，尚參觀森林保護所，以及陝西省　　生實驗所，此處早在一九三二年，即開始　　　，以抵禦當時流行之霍亂病。</p>
<p>上述數處，僅代表中英篳門閨竇合作館訪問中之一部分。該館曾盡全力適應中國科學家　　　　，雖供應之量促代表西歐人民之　心　，戰爭既巳終止，英國文化協會必能與中英科學家之密切　　，更積極發展科學與國際關係，（三.十五.倫敦電）</p>

<h3>跑馬廳應作公園</h3>
<p>主筆先生：</p>
<p>社會人羣，應如何利用餘暇？從表面上言：似爲無關重要，其實如餘暇利用不當，不獨社會追禮風氣低落，且生活範圍亦因之變改，是以　當之公共娛樂規劃，實爲市政計劃者不可或緩之要務。</p>
<p>據聞本市跑馬廳在本年一月間，又一將賽馬，投機家無不喜形於色。查賽馬一事，在國外本屬體育之一種，以有獎賽馬，藉提體育精神，惟上海則不然，不特不能寓體育於賽馬之中，反使市民增進僥倖之心理，而作賭博這活動，其結果必然增加墮落機會，社會情形紛亂，而更形復雜，有百害而無一利。</p>
<p>查上海市內街道狹窄，房屋　比，圈地缺乏，致空氣混濁，世界各大都市之公園，多爲全市總面積十分之一，惟本市圈地面積尚不及百分之四。茲值租界收回，建設伊始，本市市政當局，正計劃現代　　市政乏　，如將該地收購公開，改　公　，則本市中心，亦可有一比較寬舒之地，以供市民公共遊覽運動之　，則市容藉此發端，可逐次整頓，深盼市政當局予以研，如能究實現，確爲本市市民之福音也。張（永令，三.十五。）</p>
<p>我國八年抗戰，元氣傷盡，一切建設，破壞無餘。在此百廢待舉之時，人民理應節衣縮食，協助地方建設。詎料今春以來，浙西一帶，（猶其是海寗縣爲最甚）仍有一班地痞流氓，煽動遇民，發起　　　會。不但勞民傷財；且更踐踏春花，已發揮　　，違反新國民運動原則。縣政當局除官樣文章，出示禁止外，不見有其他具體制止辦法。鄉鎮公所更不問不聞，有的竟喪助協理，狼狽爲奸！現在有的廟中巳在「敲會譯貼　條」顯見有「矢在弦上不容不發之勢」。想各地類此的情形很多，混淆當局注意，嚴令省縣政府，作切實的有效措置！（方鞏）（三月十三日）</p>

<h3>憶詩人楊雲史</h3>
<p>— 湯立言</p>
<p>嗚呼，詩人楊雲史先生長逝矣。蓋鈍子期死而伯牙終身不復戲琴。况先生以如橡之筆，寫家國之痛，沈鬱蒼凉，直逼盛唐。少陵之骨，謫仙之貌，兼而有之，梅村，收齋，亦當爲之歛手，三百年來，無此作矣。斯文將喪，哲八其萎，則先生之逝，豈僅予人琴之感而已耶？</p>
<p>予之識先生在戊寅之初。時漢皋初陷，一時名士廣集香海。予久儀先生，因邵君泉士之介，得見於九龍英王子道。淸談竟日，娓娓不倦。睹其豐神秀朗，想見張緒當年，令人傾慕不置。自是時相往還。上天下地，無話不談，商略詩文，恒至午夜。一日，先生過訪，適謝无量在座，予爲之紹介，均相見恨晚。遂同上央京酒家，胡姬壓酒，滿店皆香。雖無黃河遠上之詞，而豪情逸興，不减旗亭畫壁時也。</p>
<p>予之詩詞素無師承，當丙寅了卯之際，執敎於厦門大學，得識陳石遺先生。予請受業如弟子，先生笑曰，「人之患，在好爲人師，」遂援筆批拙稿之後曰；</p>
<p>「以簡齋之風調，寫仲則之綺懷。詞學秦柳，亦是常行出色。合觀古今體詩，亦溫尉杜樊川之流亞也。」</p>
<p>自是始敢從事此學。而貧賤也衣食於奔走，或案廣勞形，或講壇多故，酒後尊前，偶一爲之而已。及締交於雲史先生，先生索予近作，予錄數十首以進。先生挾之以歸，異日見還。則嬴以一箋曰：</p>
<p>「有淸麗之思，其瀟灑之才，出以挺秀之筆。故能茹古而化</p>
<p>，落紙有聲。是才人筆，是多情人語。當坐名花麗人讀之，方知詞人慧業。欽佩元量。」</p>
<p>先生尤激賞予「漢皋空襲下觀秦淮歌女王熙春舞劍放歌」一自，謂可與梅村抗衡。兩先生不惜齒牙餘惠，獎借後進，自是可感。今已先後作古，而予學無寸進。每一思之，能無顏汗。</p>
<p>先生詩如梅村，而畫爲詩名所掩，亦似梅村。一日予以扇頭乞詩，先生爲畫梅一幅，老幹縱橫，疏枝錯落，蒼勁之中，別饒風韻，金冬心意二樹不是過也。並題七絕兩首云；</p>
<p>「寫得梅花贈與君。江南愁夢共紛紜。羅浮咫尺孤山遠，處處詩魂亂水雲。</p>
<p>故山猿鶴恨依稀。滿地江湖夢已非。紅萼也知耐風雪，爲人忍死待春歸。」</p>
<p>時在座諸人均無家可歸，爲之感慨晞噓。予强作笑容曰，「爐邊人如玉，皓腕凝霜雪，未老莫還鄕，還鄕須斷腸。」且上酒家樓耳。今素　猶存，而詩人長逝，竟不能忍死須臾以待春歸耶？</p>
<p>九龍山水淸佳，宋王台海水咽嗚，（宋王台，係帝昺崖山殉國時所經之地，）靑山寺蒼茫雲表，均足以發思古之幽情，而千佛山爲尤勝。春秋佳日，予等追隨先生杖履，無處不遊。一日至千佛寺，寺僧尙不俗，捧硯乞題詩。邵泉士先成五絕一首，予作七古云：</p>
<p>「我來禮佛千佛山，千佛山在羣峯問。雲霞明滅或可覩，千磴蹲躅勞躋攀。萬法如來不可說，拈花一笑我心閒。白雲流水杳然去，海水蒼茫灣復灣。」</p>
<p>先生笑曰：「崔顥題詩，太白擱筆，今日當讓汝一頭地矣。」遂竟不復作。先生爲虞山望族，世代簪纓。少入北關，中南元。張南通（季直師）後，一人而已。因之爲李合肥相國所激賞，以其長孫女道淸女士妻之。李夫人賢而早卒，擅小令，其所作附先生長江萬里樓詩詞鈔後，讀之可想見其風韻也。續娶徐夫人霞客（霞客似對雲史而言，非盜　古人也。）亦明慧知書。先生嘗謂「十年擇主而得吳，（指吳子玉）三年擇婦而得君，（指徐夫人）畢生幸福，夫復何求。」知其關房之樂甚於張敞。及後病歿缶州，先生犬之慟，爲作謚妻記，謂可與冒辟疆影梅庵憶語沈三白浮生六記　足而三也。</p>
<p>先生思想傾於保守，以少時仕淸爲郞中，（戶部及郵部）入民國後絕意進取。及後受知於吳子玉將軍，亦陳明但作幕賓，不爲官吏。故當吳將軍盛時，鞭筆十餘省，部曲偏裨，悉膺方面。而先生獨蕭然物外，薪水外一無所取。岳州以後，欠薪且達鉅萬，而先生感激知遇，仗劍從征，開關萬里。及吳公兵敗，部曲星散，而先生猶伴隨不去。即赴香海，亦受吳公之命，有所接治。世衰道徵，人心不古，若先生者可以風矣。可以托六尺之孤，可以寄百里之命，先生有焉。</p>
<p>先生旣忠於淸室，故於袁世凱深惡痛疾，於康南海推重備至。康亦以國士目之，嘗謂吳子玉曰「雲史公忠淸亮，有古名臣風度，而生非其時，惜哉。」當是時，吳公幕中謀臣如雲，猛將如雨，若總參議章太炎先生，參謀長蔣百里（方震），秘書長張其鋥，軍務處長張福來，外交處長張志潭，交通處長高恩洪等，均一時人望。而吳將軍獨於太炎及雲史兩先生敬禮有加。有所獻替，亦虛喪采納。人謂吳將軍剛愎自用，夫豈然哉？</p>
<h3>山水畫之氣韻與烟雲</h3>
<p>— 施翀職</p>
<p>南齊謝赫批評當時的畫家，備賅六法衆長者，惟陸探微衛協兩八，其他曹不興，張墨，荀勗等，偶然有得意之作，可以具體而微；此外第二，第三流以至第四五六流的畫家，僅能得其彷彿，備有二一格而已！此山水畫尙未盛行之六刺，六法並不專指山水而言，謝赫之批評對象，亦不僅是山水畫家。但是謝赫以後的宗炳，梁元帝，以及唐張彥遠，宋郭若虛等，關於六法的涵義，都有充分的關發，將「氣韻生動」先後運用之於山水畫上，品評山水畫的等第，必以氣韻爲重。其視經營位置，傳移描寫爲作　之方式；應物象形，隨類賦彩爲表現之技巧；而骨法用筆，視爲一種手段，皆無足置論。宗炳於山水序裏說：</p>
<p>『應會感神，神超理得』。論定繪畫全爲『神』與『理』的問題。凡畫家作畫，須澄懷理氣，融會貫通，然後峯岫嶢嶷，雲林森渺，至此境界，氣韻方能表現出來。梁元帝於山水松石格裏，說得更具體。</p>
<p>『天地之名，造化爲靈，設奇巧之體勢，寫山水之縱橫，或裕高而思逸；信筆妙而墨精』。表示畫家應當利用技巧來描寫自然；同時更須有高尙的人格，和幽逸的思想，才能筆妙而墨精。氣韻是寄託在繪畫的形象上的。張彥遠六法論中的意見，亦重視氣韻，而以形似為不亟之務。</p>
<p>古之景，遺其形似而尚骨氣，以形似之外求其畫也；今之畫，縱得形似而氣韻不生，以氣韻求其畫，則形似在其間矣』。說明氣韻爲作畫之先決條件，有了氣韻，才能生動；旣生動了，就得形似的目的。倘然單着意在形似上用功力，而無氣韻的修養，那末，雖能達到形似的死目的，而沒有生的氣韻。至於郭若盧的論氣韻，稱謂『生而知之』的，並非學而後得的。</p>
<p>『六法精論，萬古不移，然而骨法用筆以下五者，可學，如其氣韻，必在生知，固不可以巧密得，復不可以歲月到，默契神會，不知然而然也』。究竟如何得生而知之？較之梁元帝的『格高而思遠』，更爲抽象。總之歷代論畫山水，對於『氣韻生動』一節，都有一致之主張，蓋山水是自然界最偉大的現象，仁者樂山，智者樂水，畫家採取山水間的風雨晦晴四時之景，爲作畫題材，而烟雲變沒，更爲山水畫中所重要的點綴。自從王洽的潑墨發生以後，米元章就將董北宛之『山上有雲氣』的作風，擴充變爲米派雲山，對於紙筆用具，全不注意。（近人作畫，多利用佳紙筆，甚有把生紙做成熟紙。未免太苦）一任自然，極不從事煊染。張彥遠對於畫雲有嚴格的批評：</p>
<p>『古人畫雲，未爲臻妙，若沾涇絹素，點綴輕粉，縱口次之，謂之吹雲，雖曰妙解，不見筆跡，彥盧此意殊勝，然不得謂之學法，至以此山水家潑墨則又過矣，潑墨自有興會，吹雲未堪倣效」。他反對吹雲的勉强方法。如果潑墨成　，另爲一種墨戲，亦非畫雲的正宗。蓋山間之雲氣，四時不同，郭熙所謂：</p>
<p>「春融和，夏蓊鬱，秋疏薄，冬黯淡，畫見其大象，而不爲斬刻之形，則雲氣之態度活矣！山水之烟嵐，四時不同；春山澹　如如笑；夏山蒼翠而如滴；秋山明凈而如妝；冬山慘淡而如睡；畫見其大意而不爲刻畫之跡，則烟嵐之景象正矣。』凡此春夏秋冬之雲氣烟風，當然不能縱口吹之，或是潑墨興會所能奏劫，全在作者體騐自然之機構，用春夏秋冬不同的筆墨描寫，用春夏秋冬不同的情景佈置，所謂一應會感神，神超理得。」所以烟雲不待烘染而成，氣韻非烟雲之意。重在作者胸中湊拍而出的向然之氣，此外更有筆氣，墨氣，氣度，氣機之類，生生不息，於是氣愈盛而韻愈厚，其與水墨渲染之烟雲氣，不可混為一談耳。</p>
<p>山水畫的氣韻，既與烟雲不同，而水墨渲染，亦不能奉爲烟雲之圭泉。一味的水墨渲染，其結果則成爲有山必在雲裏，有樹必在烟裏，驟然視之，頗覺烟雲滿紙，一經細看，則索然無味，輕佻脫略，直所謂江湖派矣！近人林琴南嘗論渲染烟雲，言之頗爲澈底。</p>
<p>『昔人言山隈空處，筆入虛無，樹影微時，墨成烟霧。此四語已開江湖之派，江湖派之所以動目者，好似水墨蓊爲雲氣。樹則用濕筆加以花靑，無論晴天，亦帶雨意，似有山必在雲中，有樹必居烟裏，以爲到此氣候，即成化境，千篇一律，總不離一個薄字，但看山樵遺墨，雖重　疊嶂，何曾以雲物映帶，一樹一石，歷歷分明，都不作烟雲之氣，蓋山有四時，不能一味以淡烟濃雲烘染，即爲奇構。』可謂語語珠璣矣。</p>
<p>氣韻生動，實爲繪畫之最高準則，山水畫爲描寫自然，寄託性靈之最偉大的象形美術。佔據繪畫上最重要的位置，要達到山水畫之氣韻生動，必從六法中骨法用筆以下五者致力，同時要沒懷理氣，義成幽逸的思想，高尙的人格，—美術可以代宗敎之說，亦即與此澄懷理氣有聯環作用。董其昌之『讀萬卷畫行萬里路，』無非使胸中脫盡塵俗，邱　內營，方能隨手寫出，而爲山水傳神也。</p>
<h3>離緒</h3>
<p>— 蘇丹</p>
<p>像一隻灰色的候鳥，飛到南方又飛到北方，飛到北方又飛到南方，永遠的啊！一個寂寞的漂泊的旅人。</p>
<p>剛在這蕭瑟的古寺住了兩個月，明天又將負起那沉重的行囊，和一顆更沉重，更沉重的，飽含着離愁的心他去了，那遼遠無盡的行程啊！</p>
<p>雖然別離在我已經不是第一次了，但，總有那不多的离愁；那末多的依然。</p>
<p>然而什麽又是使我眷戀的呢？我是眷戀着一羣孩子們天眞的心，沒有虛假；也沒有謊騙，是一點聖潔的眞情的溫暖。</p>
<p>下午小菊同小渭上這里來的時候，他們是那末誠學的，兩對圓溜的，充滿了生命光輝的眼睛看着我，親的說：</p>
<p>「老師，你明天就去了嗎？」爲什麽不再敎我們呢？」</p>
<p>我能跟他們說些什麽呢？即使說出來，他們會懂得嗎？孩子們會懂得靑年人爲着希望而奔走嗎？我只得勉強的笑笑：</p>
<p>「會有比我好的老師來敎你們的。」</p>
<p>可是他們却說：「老師可以不走我嗎？</p>
<p>我可以不走嗎？連我自己也不能說，我不敢看他們懇切的眼光；我想爲什麽要離棄這些孩子們呢？我走究竟是需要追求點什麽呢？是那如花的憧憬嗎？</p>
<p>我暗然了，我不知道該向這些孩子們說些什麼話。</p>
<p>生活鞭策着我，希望又在閃爍，不要責備我是自私的，可是誰又能放棄希望不去追求呢？人是爲着追求希望而生活，爲着生活而去追求希望的。</p>
<p>在晨會中我吿訴過他們，我說：「人跟人之間總有分離的時候，我們不要老是生活在狹小的圈子里，要有遠大的志向，將來你們長大了，也要離開爸爸媽媽……離開了他們一個人到各處去，去找各人自己滿意的事情做，不要爲了離開家而感到悲哀，因爲自己的志向和希望是要緊的……」</p>
<p>這些話，是對他們說的話抑是對我自己說的話呢？我又向他們重複了一遍，孩子們的頭低垂下去了，沉默佔有了我們。</p>
<p>自己的志向和希望是要緊的，我不得不事負孩子們的盛情了。</p>
<p>天色階了，他們含着淚向我告別，是那末依依的不忍離去。他們的，手被我緊握着我是多末的感動啊，</p>
<p>「不要難過，以後我會再來看你們的，聽老師的話，回家去吧！好好的用功，學問是世界上最寳貴的。」</p>
<p>他們是去了，然而，我的心却漸漸的沉重下來，我雖是承受了偉大的眞情與溫暖，我也有無限的悵惘與依戀啊！</p>
<p>明天，又要踏上蜿蜓的路，寂寞的走，我又將是一個漂泊的旅人了！</p>
<p>凄淸的別離啊！那遼遠無盡的行程。謝東平</p>
<p>筆底春秋</p>
<h3>「兩條綫」</h3>
<p>— 謝東平</p>
<p>幾何學上約定義：「兩條平行機，永遠不能。確在一起」，但實際上兩條綫無限制的發展，必然碰在一起，因爲地球是橢圓形，而不是正圓形與四方形的綠故。</p>
<p>（一）不過，這裏所要說的那兩條綫，並不是兩條平行綫，而是構成直角的一條縱綫和一條橫綫。縱綫就是從上到下的綫，它象徵着專制與獨裁，橫綫就是從左到右或從右到左的錢，它象徵着民主。</p>
<p>我們可以很肯定的說，歷史的發展，必然發展成爲一個或兩個直角，至其終極，必然連橫綫上的縱綫亦消滅之而只存留下一條無限長的黃戔。這條橫綫就是無數個獨立，自由平等的個人，相互攜手所構成，每一個獨立的個人，就是這條綫裏邊的某一個「點」。在這樣的社會裏，任何一個個人，他（她）的權利與義務，都是一樣的，等於在一條平行的綫裘的任何一點，它們在那條綫裏的地位，彼此完全是一樣的。</p>
<p>（二）中國現下歷史的發展，正在漸漸的發展成爲一個或兩個直角，可是同時也可能發展成爲三個或四個直角。毫無疑問的，橫錢正在無限制的增長，同時毫無疑問的，縱綫也正在竭力的掙扎，一面阻礙着橫綫的形成與增長，一面自求生命之延續。假如一條脆弱的橫綫，被兇橫的縱綫，攔腰直穿而下，那末，其所構成的直角，必然是四個。</p>
<p>看，民主的呼聲，固然是喊得響的了，但一切從上而下的作風，仍然沒有改變。即使最民主的說法，即是「一切都總該要由下而上」，一句話這「由下而上」的作法，固然是民主作法，但這由下而上的那個「上」「下」觀念，實在還不是眞正民主的觀念，因爲一個眞正風主的社會裘，是沒有什麽上下之別的，任何人的身分都是人民。而任何人都有權利作大總統。有固定的「上」，又有固定的「下」，那能稱得上民主呢？</p>
<p>在現在，中國一條有歷史性的縱綫，和一條有時代意義的橫綫，它們快要碰頭，或者可以說已經碰頭了。我們希望這兩條綫碰頭之後，經過一番「中和」作用，只存留下一條無限長的橫綫，不要大家引長，而構成四個直角。</p>
<h3>雙宿雙飛（二一）</h3>
<p>— 趙淸閣</p>
<p>但是，翁二太太一把拉住了石玉樓。她依然不曾瞭解他心裏道時所想的一切，她總覺得石玉樓是在爲她瘋狂，如今石玉樓要走，更是在向她撒嬌。她簡直以爲自己變成「四郞探母」中的楊延輝，石玉樓就是鐵鏡公主，他們好像正演着「坐宮」的一幕。</p>
<p>『別着急，我的寳貝！你就是離開荆州，也離開不了我，所以，你不必想這些。』翁二太太拍着石玉樓的肩膀說。</p>
<p>『那才怪，我馬上就離開你！』石玉樓氣忿地終於大聲地說了一句話，然後便要撑開翁二太太。</p>
<p>『可是，我還是先頭的一句話：「我不在意」！』翁二太太又重覆了剛才的話，並且問他：『你明白嗎？你明白我爲什麽會不在意呢？』翁二太太說着，依舊緊緊拉住石玉樓。</p>
<p>『爲什麽？爲了戲子多的很，今兒我走了，明兒還有更好的角兒再來供您開心。橫豎您翁二太太有的是錢，捧了這個還可以捧那個。』石玉樓一口氣講了這篇話，他感到比平時他唱戲還吃力。</p>
<p>翁二太太哭了！</p>
<p>「噢，怪不得你這麽大火，原來你是這樣想的！那你就未免太寃枉了我的好心，你這個呆子！」</p>
<p>聽見翁二太太這樣說，石玉樓給怔住了！他努力地理了一下已經紊亂的思緒，他才明白翁二太太還是不出他最初所料想的憲思。可是他依舊半信半疑地說：</p>
<p>『我不懂你的意思！』</p>
<p>『眞的？』翁二太太帶幾分調皮地問他。</p>
<p>「嗯！」石玉樓應着。心裏開始感到煩重，他有些不願聽下去的樣子。</p>
<p>「那麽我吿訴你，我的意思是：你不會離開我的，因爲你走到那裏，我就要跟你到那裏！即使天涯海角。」爲二太太一個字兒一個字兒地咬着舌尖兒說下去。</p>
<p>石玉樓越發地感到壓迫了，他矛盾地後悔不該讓翁二太太講出她的眞話，他原怕她有這樣的念頭，所以他才撩起來談道個問題他撩起這個問題的意思，是要勸止爲二太太起這樣的念頭，如今的效果，是適得其反地彷彿更加強了翁二太太的決心。因此，石玉樓有些惶惑了！他沉思了一會，終於毅然地說：</p>
<p>「你不能存這種念頭，你有家；有丈夫；有孩子；你是一個官宦門第的太太，而我却是一個戲子。」</p>
<p>翁二太太不等石玉樓的話謂完，便搶着說：</p>
<p>「請你不要講下去了！家，是我經手建起來的，應該再山我解散牠；丈夫，活着等於死了；孩子，我可以寄養出去；這一切都毫無留　之處，也毫無顧慮之處。你說你是戲子，我吿訴你我是淸唱的出身；雖然後來作了官兒的姨太太；可也並不比你的身價高貴到那兒。所以，咱們同是天涯淪落人！只有咱們在一道兒，才能心曲相通。」</p>
<p>翁二太太如今變得有主張，有意志了！這一半是墨太太的影響，一半是在石玉樓的面前，烘拖出來的。她的話，堅强而果斷，使石玉樓脆弱的性靈，受到嚴重的威脅。同時相當驚訝她竟是這麽一個放得開，擔得起的直率人。</p>
<p>「怎麽又不說話了？」翁二太太焦灼地追問石玉樓。希望石玉樓能够給她一個肯定的答覆。</p>
<p>「我，我沒有什麽可說的。我心裏亂的很！」</p>
<p>石玉樓這會子確是心裏很亂！他不知道應當怎樣說才好，他也　不定主意應當怎樣辦？他只有仍舊保持銜默。但是他的銜默却被翁二太太誤以爲心許！因此，她也不再深究下去，她自信已經把揑住了石玉樓。她開始爲一個未來的夢幻打算着。</p>

<h3>The Northeast Headquarters Will Move to Shenyang; Soviet Troops in Changchun Are Already Withdrawing</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 18th] Our main forces have already entered and garrisoned Shenyang, and the situation there is gradually stabilizing. The Northeast Headquarters and the Pacification Commissioner's Office have dispatched personnel to survey locations, and the move will be completed within a week. Shenyang will become the military and political center of the Northeast in the next two months. [Central News Agency Changchun Dispatch, 19th] Various signs indicate that the Soviet troops here are preparing to withdraw or have already begun to withdraw. (1) The municipal government has received verbal notification from the Soviet side to prepare to take over buildings. (2) The Soviet side has notified all food stores to settle accounts and notified the municipal government to settle public funds. The funds issued are half in Red Army notes and half in rubles. (3) More than a thousand former Manchukuo soldiers previously detained here by the Soviet troops have now been transported north by train. (4) The Soviet troops' current bread orders with local bakeries are only for one or two days at a time, unlike the previous orders for several months. It is reported that the Soviet troops in the western district of Changchun have already withdrawn. [Central News Agency Chongqing Dispatch, 19th] A spokesperson for the Military Affairs Commission stated: Regarding the Soviet Chief of Staff, Lieutenant General Trotsenko's claim that the Chinese Changchun Railway between Panjin and Lushun, and between Panjin and Changchun, suffered multiple instances of sabotage or the laying of landmines, and that the Chinese government should be responsible because the railway's order is maintained by the Chinese railway police, it is found that there are many illegal armed forces along the Changchun Railway line. Without sufficient armed force, it is impossible to maintain security along the line. Furthermore, the Soviet troops' withdrawal from Shenyang to Changchun was not notified to our side in advance, nor was there any prior consultation with our side regarding the procedures for taking over the defense along the line. One or two days after the Soviet troops' withdrawal, traffic between Shenyang and Changchun was already obstructed by illegal armed forces. We were unable to dispatch troops to guard the area. Therefore, regarding the sabotage of traffic on the Chinese Changchun Railway, our side cannot be held responsible for maintaining traffic before our troops arrive along the railway line.</p>
<p>[United Press Chongqing Dispatch, 19th] Semi-official sources here stated that the Chief of Staff of the Northeast Soviet Army Commander Malinovsky met with the National Government's military representative Dong Yanping in Changchun yesterday and protested the "frequent disruptions" of railway transportation between Changchun and Dalian, stating that, according to the Sino-Soviet Treaty, the Chinese side is responsible for protecting the railway line. Dong replied that there are irregular troops not under the government's command along the line that are carrying out secret sabotage, causing transportation to be disrupted. The Soviet Chief of Staff further explained that, with the exception of a few procuring food and supplies, the Soviet troops south of Changchun have now completely withdrawn. Dong requested that the Soviet side protect the National Government's administrative officials sent to the Northeast to take over. The Soviet Chief of Staff replied that the Soviet authorities will only be responsible for protecting the areas where Soviet troops are stationed, and that there is no reason to suggest that National Government officials are being threatened.</p>

<h3>Zhongxing Coal Mine Prepares to Resume Operations; Two Northeast Mines Occupied by Communist Troops Have Been Flooded</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 19th] Zaozhuang Report: The government and Communist representatives to the three-person joint management committee of the Zhongxing Coal Mine have not yet been appointed. The Beiping Military Mediation Department will solicit opinions from both sides before making the appointments. It is heard that Wu Ke'er, the special commissioner of the Economic Ministry's Yu-Yu-Jin Special Envoy Office responsible for taking over the Zaozhuang Coal Mine, will only be able to assist with matters within the scope of technology in the future. The two Northeast mines of the Zhongxing Coal Mine occupied by Communist troops have been flooded. The South Mine is protected by the National Army and has not been damaged. The troops of both sides have not yet withdrawn from the mining area. It is rumored that the National Army is preparing to withdraw. The Zhongxing Company is currently preparing to resume operations based on the repair plans reported by Chief Engineer Collick. Furthermore, the coal reserves in Zaozhuang appear to be limited, but the coal quality is very good and most suitable for coking. During the Japanese occupation, the highest output reached 4,000 tons per day, most of which was transported back to Japan by the North China Development Company for use in general national defense heavy industries. Very little of it was used to fire boilers. Recent estimates indicate that if the mine can smoothly resume operations, it can produce an average of 2,000 tons per day.</p>
<h3>The People's Political Council Opens Today</h3>
<p>[United Press Chongqing Dispatch, 19th] The Second Plenary Session of the People's Political Council will begin at dawn on the 20th. Chairman Chiang will attend and address the representatives.</p>
<h3>Declaration of the Plenary Session (Continued and Completed)</h3>
<p>Fifth, we must implement the guiding principles of the Sixth National Congress, which emphasized the Principle of People's Livelihood. The Principle of People's Livelihood is the ultimate goal to be achieved by the Three Principles of the People. At the present stage, to promote the Principle of People's Livelihood, this meeting believes there are both short-term and long-term solutions. First, we must stabilize order and alleviate the people's suffering before we can implement large-scale economic construction. Right now, we must alleviate the suffering of the farmers, workers, public educators, and soldiers defending the country who are on or near the brink of starvation. Their lives must be improved through legal means. This requires first stabilizing prices and maintaining currency value. The government must do everything possible to achieve this. Of course, we must also restore production to increase domestic supplies, purchase and transport grain to prepare for disaster relief, practice strict frugality to reduce unnecessary consumption, and establish international economic cooperation to allow the large-scale import of foreign materials, especially production tools. But the most urgent task at present is to restore transportation. As it is now, transportation is disrupted everywhere, people cannot travel freely, goods cannot flow smoothly, and everything else is impossible. Therefore, disrupting transportation not only harms the people's livelihood but is tantamount to placing the people in mortal danger. This meeting must frankly point out that we hope the Executive Headquarters for Military Mediation will effectively stop all actions that hinder road repair work and disrupt transportation administration.</p>
<p>In terms of long-term solutions, equalizing land ownership and regulating capital are the fundamental principles that our party must implement. Relieving the rural areas and curbing the current trend of land annexation to support independent farmers are also urgent tasks. The implementation of the post-war five-year economic construction plan relies on international economic and technical assistance. The various economic construction programs set by the Sixth National Congress of our party are the most correct plans. It is regrettable that they have not been effectively implemented in the past nine months due to the war and demobilization. In the future, we must urge the relevant government departments to intensify their implementation of the above-mentioned measures so that the people can live and work in peace and contentment and improve their living standards.</p>
<p>Sixth, we must uphold our original intention in the War of Resistance to maintain national sovereignty and consolidate world peace. Our fundamental foreign policy is to ensure the integrity of our national territory, sovereignty, and administration, and to abide by international treaties to consolidate lasting world peace. Our rejection of Japan's threat to conclude an anti-communist agreement and the most important goal of the eight-year War of Resistance were also based on this. Now that the War of Resistance has ended, for the sake of post-war reconstruction, we not only need domestic stability but also international peace. We do not want any contradictions or estrangement to exist between countries, so that the defeated aggressors have no chance of a comeback. We sincerely uphold the UN Charter. Our representatives have painstakingly tried to promote cooperation between our major allies at international conferences, which is a concrete manifestation of our policy. To establish lasting peace in the Pacific and the world, we must eradicate the opportunity for the resurgence of Japanese imperialism. This requires full understanding and close cooperation between our country and our allies, especially with the Soviet Union, which shares a border with us. We are willing to increase mutual trust and friendship with the utmost sincerity. We firmly believe that the strict observance of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance by both sides is the primary condition for increasing mutual trust and friendship. At the same time, in order to complete economic construction, we welcome the cooperation of any allied capital and technology within the scope of not violating Chinese law or conflicting with international agreements to which China is a party. Because only an independent, unified, strong, and prosperous China can eradicate the resurgence of Japanese imperialism and maintain lasting peace in the Pacific and the world. We firmly believe that the Northeast issue can be resolved reasonably and legally based on this understanding. We will not lose our confidence or neglect our efforts because of temporary phenomena. Finally, we must awaken all our party comrades to cherish revolutionary history, establish confidence, and recognize our own responsibilities. At this time when political tutelage is about to end and the revolutionary cause is entering the period of national construction, our party comrades must know that our party is the largest revolutionary party in China. It has led the revolution to save the country in the past, and it will lead the revolution to build the country in the future. This is our historical mission that has remained unchanged for decades. We will never shirk our responsibilities. We must remember that the Republic of China was created by our founder and the martyrs of our party. The suppression of warlords and the completion of unification were completed under the leadership of our party. The shackles of unequal treaties for a hundred years were lifted under the leadership of our party. The eight-year War of Resistance brought glorious victory to the country and the nation, and it was also successfully led by our party. Since our party has been able to complete these four great missions in modern history, we are even more convinced that under the leadership of our leader, it will be able to lead the compatriots of the whole country to complete this even greater mission of peaceful national construction. In the past, during the period of political tutelage, there were various shortcomings in both politics and party affairs. Many of these were due to objective conditions, but we ourselves cannot shirk our responsibility. The purpose of our revolution, as our founder said, is "to bring the people out of misery and into prosperity." Now that the country is in such a difficult situation and the people are suffering so much, we are truly heartbroken. We revolutionaries must be brave enough to take responsibility and brave enough to improve. We must conduct profound and continuous self-examination. This meeting believes that in order to shoulder the arduous responsibilities ahead, we must concentrate our will, reflect on ourselves, and strengthen ourselves to reform our party's work. We must work hard and serve the people to carry out our original revolutionary intentions. We must work together with all compatriots and people from all parties with a spirit of sincerity and trust to promote the success of national construction. In the past, our party received the cooperation of compatriots throughout the country, which enabled us to continuously accomplish great historical missions. Now, we must build the glorious and victorious Republic of China into a modern country that is prosperous, strong, and happy. We must unite and hold high the banner of the Three Principles of the People to enter the bright path of peaceful national construction.</p>

<p>[United Press Tianjin Dispatch, 19th] General Wedemeyer hosted a press conference here today. Several divisions of the National Army will be transported to the Northeast by American ships to strengthen their forces. However, there is a severe shortage of pilots and airport personnel, so the National Army will not be transported to the Northeast by American aircraft. Regarding the situation in the Northeast, he has "very little news" and does not know if the Soviet troops have plans to withdraw from other cities and towns besides Shenyang. Regarding the possibility of the American military in China sending Japanese soldiers and civilians back to their country in the Northeast, he has inquired about it. If it is decided to do so, the repatriation work can begin on April 15. He has read the Sino-Soviet Treaty in detail and believes that China has not given up sovereignty over Dalian. The United States can use Dalian as a port for repatriating Japanese personnel. Wedemeyer is quite optimistic about the overall situation in China.</p>

<h3>Soviet Troops Delay Withdrawal; Iran Formally Files Complaint; This Action May Trigger Cabinet Crisis</h3>
<p>Truman to Appeal to Stalin for Reconciliation</p>
<p>[Our News] London, 19th (Broadcast): Iran's long-awaited complaint was finally delivered to the United Nations organization last night by the Iranian representative to the United States, requesting the Security Council to convene a meeting next Monday to discuss it. The content accuses the Soviet Union of violating the tripartite troop withdrawal agreement and interfering in Iran's internal affairs.</p>
<p>[Our News] London, 19th (Broadcast): Washington diplomatic circles believe that Iran's complaint to the Security Council will lead to the collapse of the current Saed Cabinet in Iran. According to some sources, Moscow warned Iran internally that if Iran filed a complaint with the Security Council, the Soviet Union would regard it as an unfriendly act. The newly appointed Soviet ambassador to Iran is expected to arrive in Tehran today, which is quite noteworthy. In addition, British Ambassador Bullard, who has already resigned, left Tehran for home today. [Agence France-Presse, Washington, 18th] This question denies the London rumor that the US government limited Iran to 24 hours to decide whether to submit the Iranian issue to the Security Council. [Central News Agency, Washington, 18th (Special Dispatch)] UN Secretary-General Lai Yi flew to Washington today. US Secretary of State Byrnes issued a brief welcome speech upon Lai's arrival. Lai is scheduled to visit President Truman and Byrnes on the 20th and go to New York on the 21st.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 19th] Today, diplomatic circles here believe that the crisis in Iran may prompt President Truman to make a direct appeal to Stalin, demanding the solidarity of the three powers. The State Department denies this news, but cannot be confirmed by the State Department before such an appeal is issued. In fact, this method is not without precedent. Previously, when US-Soviet relations encountered difficulties, President Truman and his predecessor Roosevelt repeatedly expressed their views directly to Stalin. Diplomatic figures believe that it is reasonable for the President to take this action before the Security Council convenes next week. [United Press, Washington, 18th] State Department authorities confirmed today that the Soviet Union has responded to Iran's request for the withdrawal of Soviet troops, but demanded that Iran cede oil rights. It is said that negotiations have not yet been conducted with the United Kingdom regarding the internationalization of Iranian oil sources, but it is pointed out that this may be the only solution.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 19th] British newspapers today cited reports from Tehran claiming that Soviet authorities are urging Iranian Prime Minister Saed to appoint members of the leftist pro-Soviet Tudeh Party, who hold the two important vacancies of Minister of Interior and Minister of Foreign Affairs, to the cabinet. [United Press, Baghdad, 19th] The Iraqi Airlines managed by the government refused to carry passengers from Baghdad to Tehran today. This shows the extent of the Iraqi authorities' concern for the situation in Iran. The authorities only allowed the plane to fly to Khanaqin, 200 miles from Tehran.</p>
<h3>Ten Top Soviet Cabinet Members All "Isolationists," All Distrustful of Western Countries</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 19th] A special correspondent for the Daily Chronicle said: The sudden change of Soviet leaders has made the world outside the "Iron Curtain" feel astonished. Today, the top ten leaders of the Soviet Union are all figures who are hostile to Western countries. Stalin has eliminated the "pro-Western faction" in his close cabinet and replaced them with the backbone of the "isolationist faction," of course with Stalin himself at the top, followed by People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Molotov, third by Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet Kalinin, fourth by the little-known Malenkov, fifth by former People's Commissar for Internal Affairs Beria, followed by Mikoyan, Marshal Voroshilov, Zhdanov, Andreev, and Kaganovich. These are the ten top figures in the Soviet Union who do not trust Western countries and do not like Western countries. Except for Beria, all of them are members of the Communist Party Politburo. Molotov, 55, is now firmly in the second position in the Soviet Union. He does not believe in Western nations and does not like Western nations. He is a typical Stalinist figure. Although Kalinin is nominally above Stalin in position, he is actually only a figurehead. Malenkov is Stalin's closest confidant and it is expected that Stalin's will may designate him as his successor. Beria, 47, is the leader of the national police and has been faithfully protecting the safety of Soviet leaders for fifteen years. Stalin has now ordered him to be responsible for matters relating to atomic secrets. From the Western point of view, those who are more interested among the remaining five are Zhdanov and Andreev. The former is the organization minister of the Communist Party and a political disciple of Stalin. He and Andreev both advocate extreme communism and are extremely resentful of Western democratic ideas.</p>

<h3>U.S. Congressman's Warning</h3>
<p>Allied Nations May Become Enemies, Prepare for Sudden Attacks</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 18th] Speaking at a meeting of the House of Representatives today, Democratic Congressman Sykes said that "the United States must prepare for attacks from any direction," and said that "the United States should reorganize and train its troops based on the experience gained in World War II." He said that "most of the Soviet army has not been disarmed and is implementing compulsory military training. It is not difficult to imagine the actual strength of the Communist army. In addition, the industrial capacity used by the Soviet Union is also very strong. In short, it is difficult to predict when we will have to rise up to defend ourselves again, but history proves that allies in one war may become enemies in another war."</p>
<h3>Britain Rejects French Proposal on Spain Again, Submits to Security Council Instead</h3>

<h3>Canadian Prime Minister Announces Details of Atomic Espionage Case, Soviet-Canadian Relations Unaffected</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Ottawa, 18th] Canadian Prime Minister Mackenzie King made a statement on the atomic bomb espionage case in the House of Commons today, stating that he sincerely believed that the involvement of employees of the Soviet Embassy in Canada in this case was not requested by their government in advance, and that he expected that once the case was concluded, the relationship between the Soviet Union and Canada would be improved. The government must handle this case carefully to avoid causing international disputes. The reason why the case was delayed until February of this year before it was announced and investigated was for this reason. The Canadian government deliberately waited until after the conclusion of the United Nations General Assembly in London before announcing the news in order to avoid hindering the proceedings of the General Assembly. The purpose of this investigation is to discover and punish Canadian suspects. The Soviet Union had already admitted the existence of the espionage case even before Canada announced the details of the case. There is now an opinion that there is no need to use espionage to share the secrets of the atomic bomb with the Soviet Union. However, the occurrence of this case dates back to the beginning of 1943, when the achievements of atomic energy research had not yet reached the point where they could arouse the interest of the Soviet Union. Later, when I proved that the various activities of the Soviet Embassy in Canada were a serious obstacle to the United Kingdom, the United States, and Canada, I had a conversation with President Truman and then secretly went to the United Kingdom to meet with Prime Minister Attlee.</p>
<p>[United Press, Ottawa, 18th] The Canadian Prime Minister announced in Parliament today that, according to Soviet codebreakers, the Soviet Union actually used Canada as a espionage base for the United States and the United Kingdom, and the Fifth Column was also located in Canada.</p>

<h3>Will Cosmic Rays Replace Atomic Energy?</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Lahore, 19th] Dr. Keer, a cosmic ray research scientist and assistant physics teacher at Forman Christian College here, recently predicted that in the not-too-distant future, the era of cosmic rays will replace the current era of atomic energy. According to Dr. Keer's research, cosmic ray radiation is 100,000 times stronger than the achievements of modern factories, and the radiation of its unit molecule is also stronger than the nucleus split from uranium atoms. Only a small amount of uranium is needed to make an atomic bomb, so compared with cosmic rays, today's atomic bomb is nothing more than a firework. The main obstacle to using cosmic rays at present is the lack of invention of a method to install them. However, the time to use cosmic rays to radiate atomic energy is not far away. When entering the new era, the atomic energy era will gradually become obsolete.</p>

<h3>To Strive for Freedom and Independence: India Determined to Fight with All Its Might - Nehru's Speech in Singapore</h3>
<p>[Report from News Agencies] London, 19th Broadcast: Nehru arrived in Singapore yesterday amidst cheers. Today, he attended a mass rally and delivered a startling speech. It is claimed that "India is not striving for independence for itself alone, but is determined to fight to the end for the freedom of Asia.

Aside from the Malays, the Chinese comprise the largest part of the population. We Indians and the Chinese people have a growing friendship. Singapore will be a melting pot for Asian unity. In the future, the Asian people must work together, not only for their own benefit, but also for the benefit and freedom of the world. I hope this trip will contribute to the promotion of Asian unity."</p>
<h3>Goering, in His Testimony, Still Believes in Might</h3>
<p>And Explains the Purpose of the Nazi Party</p>
<p>[Reuters, Nuremberg, 19th] Goering, under questioning by the chief American prosecutor at the International Military Tribunal yesterday, answered as follows:</p>
<p>(1) I have no doubt that Hitler and Goebbels committed suicide. (2) In the days before Germany's collapse, neither I nor Himmler conducted negotiations with the enemy. (3) Germany's attack on the Soviet Union in 1941 was a "dangerous action for Germany." Goering added: I did not want to wage war, but as the old saying goes, "The strong in arms have peace." I still hold this belief. The chief American prosecutor further questioned Goering, saying that he was the only person who could explain the true purpose of the Nazi Party and the intention of the "Fuhrer principle." Goering replied that the Nazi Party's purpose was to eliminate all opposition forces that could disrupt construction work. Regarding the "Fuhrer principle," it can be explained by the words of the late American President Roosevelt: "Most European countries have abandoned democracy. This is not because European countries do not need democracy, but because democracy cannot produce people who give work, bread, and peace." Moreover, democracy has in fact destroyed Germany, only the rule of strong leaders can restore its peace.</p>

<h3>Special Article: Shanghai's Current Financial Problems</h3>
<p>— Yu Zengkang</p>
<p>Since the victory, Shanghai's financial situation has continued in its past state of instability. Especially after the end of January this year, the fluctuations have been even greater, turning into a state of chaos. Although the authorities have cracked down on speculation and closed down the black market, black market activities still exist. It was not until the foreign exchange market was opened and the gold policy was emphasized that the financial situation became slightly more stable. However, the seriousness has not been resolved, and speculators are still looking for opportunities to enter. Therefore, we still hope that there will be reasonable improvements so that it can achieve lasting stability. This is necessary during the rehabilitation period. Moreover, post-war economic construction depends on financial support, so the resolution of financial problems and the rationalization of financial trends should be implemented as soon as possible, without further delay.</p>
<p>Now that the country is unified and Shanghai has returned to its position as a financial center, the impact of changes is no longer limited to the local level, as it was during the period of occupation, but is now national in scope; the recent gold rush is an example of this. Therefore, the improvement of Shanghai's financial situation cannot be delayed. As for the improvement, we must concentrate all our efforts to overcome the deep-rooted problems and numerous obstacles. We must not give up eating because of choking, or accommodate the facts. Impractical actions and delays should no longer be used, as they will only create problems and increase difficulties. Existing weaknesses should not be allowed to exist in even the slightest degree, so as not to increase obstacles to post-war economic construction.</p>
<p>Shanghai's financial chaos is too deep and too far from the ideal, so improvement methods cannot be achieved in one fell swoop, but can only be implemented separately according to the urgency of the need, and actively promoted in order to achieve success. At the same time, improvement measures must be carried out in multiple ways, addressing both the symptoms and the root causes, and we must strive for time and move forward in order to prevent the recurrence of major financial fluctuations. The author would like to offer a few suggestions, based on my personal views, regarding the areas that urgently need improvement, for the reference of my fellow countrymen:</p>
<p>Unified Financial System: In the past, the financial industry, regardless of its management methods or operations, was quite complex, and the levels varied. Furthermore, the operations lacked direction and planning, and each followed its own natural development, resulting in a chaotic financial system and dispersed financial power. To improve Shanghai's finances, we must first unify the financial system from this chaotic situation and strengthen the banking system, so that it can have the power to regulate and control social finance. First, although the central bank has gradually stabilized its rightful position, it still feels that it lacks the ability to cope with the current financial upheavals and credit expansion, so we still hope for further reform and strengthening so that it can take on a definite leading role to control the entire Shanghai financial system. Second, although the current banking system has a division between state-owned and private, and the organization has a form of decentralization, the scope of operations has not yet been divided, inevitably overlapping. Not only can it not achieve the effect of division of labor and cooperation, but it also hinders the development of its own special operations, so that the industrial financial system cannot be established. The incompleteness of the financial system, coupled with the current unfavorable phenomenon of depleted industrial capital and inflated commercial capital, cannot be adjusted and improved. Therefore, in the future, national banks should quickly abandon the operation of ordinary banking businesses, and each should work hard in its own position, without competing with each other, and cooperate fully to consolidate financial power.</p>
<p>(II) Improve Banking Operations: The improper banking operations are also a contributing factor to Shanghai's financial chaos, so we cannot allow them to continue to be delayed, and we must strive for improvement. However, the reason why banking operations have not been able to develop properly also has its contributing factors, such as weak capital, narrow business scope, excessive interest burden, and lack of investment channels, especially during the occupation period, and even to this day, there has been no improvement, and they are still wandering on the wrong path. This phenomenon not only hinders financial stability, but is also harmful and useless to the banking industry itself. Therefore, in the future, we should actively reform so that it can meet the needs of post-war construction, so that it can stand in the environment of the new era. First, banks must establish a sound business policy and formulate a comprehensive plan so that business expansion has something to follow. Second, improve the internal organization and increase service efficiency to eliminate the adverse effects of the public on the banking industry during the occupation period. Third, expand the scope of activities to improve the current situation of dust gathering in Shanghai and the lack of outlets for financial funds. Fourth, work hard on the development of the credit system to increase deposits and expand business. Fifth, we should guide the reduction of social interest rates to reduce costs. Sixth, at this time, it is necessary to re-examine the loan policy of banks. In order to help the recovery of industry and the expansion of its own business, banks should adopt a mixed-operation system. In addition to adjusting short-term commercial credit, they should actively participate in industrial lending, but the nature of industrial lending is different and should be limited to available fixed capital. Seventh, the banking industry should stop speculative operations and assisting speculators. Eighth, banks should reduce investment in real estate and should open up other investment avenues and invest in legitimate businesses. Although the above items require self-improvement of the banking industry, self-improvement is not enough, and active supervision and promotion by the authorities are also needed.</p>
<p>(III) Establish Capital Market: The lack of a capital market in Shanghai has always been deplored by knowledgeable people, resulting in the inability to link finance and industry, and the lack of a home for private floating capital, with far-reaching harmful effects. Before the war, there was also a securities market for buying and selling public bonds and foreign stocks. During the occupation period, there was also the rise of the Chinese stock market, but this market was completely dominated by speculation and lost the original intention of establishing a securities market. Now, after the victory, the market has been closed, resulting in a black market. Black market activities lack a formal channel, and it is easier for large households to manipulate, resulting in unprecedented large fluctuations. Although the authorities have cracked down, it is of no help in practice. It is better to resume operations as soon as possible, rationalize securities trading, and guide floating capital to industry, which can also partially solve the serious problem of floating capital. However, the resumption of the securities market must be very cautious, and we must not repeat the mistakes of the past and create a place for speculation. It should be thoroughly improved so that it can become a formal capital market. First, the Chinese stocks, public bonds, and foreign stocks markets should be merged and opened to facilitate management. Second, the listed stocks should be strictly reviewed to avoid the influx of bad credit and the malignant expansion of chips, in order to protect the safety of investors and cultivate the habit of investing. Third, strictly stipulate the range of ups and downs to enhance the power to stabilize stock prices. Fourth, improve the stock issuance method and establish an intermediary institution for guarantee underwriters to strengthen the organization of the stock market. Fifth, Issue Bonds to facilitate the abundance of industrial funds. Sixth, Government Bonds rise, increase the number of bonds, prevent manipulation by speculators, and absorb a part of the floating capital.</p>
<p>(IV) Restore the Exchange: In addition to the securities market, Shanghai also has the financial market for bidding, foreign exchange and foreign currency, as well as the commodity market for food, cloth, etc. Since the victory, they have also been suspended one after another, resulting in all transactions falling into the black market and failing to be incorporated into the right track. The huge fluctuations are even more severe than the securities black market. Therefore, the exchange policy cannot be decided without delay, especially now that the foreign exchange market has been opened, in order to stabilize exchange rates, it is even more necessary to stabilize finance and prices. First, at a time when the problem of tourism cannot be completely resolved and speculation cannot be eradicated, and the financial authorities have already emphasized the use of gold policies, the gold market should be restored as soon as possible so that tourism funds can flow back into gold, and the government can reasonably control it. This is also a way to temporarily stabilize tourism funds, and it is easier to achieve results than manipulating the black market. Second, the commodity market should also be restored as soon as possible so that commodity trading can be rationalized, and the market price fluctuation has a certain range, so that normal industry and commerce can engage in regular transactions. Then tourism funds in industry and commerce can also have a home.</p>
<p>Financial stability, although dependent on the end of inflation, but the contraction of currency and the slowing of currency circulation rate must also have a sound financial system to facilitate the promotion. Although the above four items are mostly old-fashioned, they are indeed what urgently need to be resolved at present. If they can be earnestly achieved, then the current financial problems can be easily solved and rescued from chaos. Moreover, the financial situation itself can have some changes and tend to be sound. The unification of the financial system and the improvement of banking operations are the basic problems of financial institutions, which can enhance the control power over the entire financial system. The establishment of a capital market and the restoration of the exchange are not only the necessary ways for financial prosperity, but also the problem of tourism can be temporarily solved, and it can also be used as a base for the central bank's open market policy. The above four points are still our minimum requirements for Shanghai's financial improvement. The further reforms in the future can be started from here. In short, Shanghai's financial situation in the future must appear in a new posture in the post-war economy in order to ultimately accomplish the arduous responsibilities and missions that it should shoulder.</p>

<h3>Local Communications</h3>
<p>Suzhou</p>
<p>Request to Sell Received Supplies at Affordable Prices</p>
<p>The county magistrate of this county believes that Suzhou was a place where enemy materials were concentrated during its occupation. There is a considerable amount of stored materials, and after the victory, various parties came to Suzhou to take them over, sealing them into warehouses. Stored for a long time, they are prone to mildew. To this day, they have not been processed. At a time when prices are soaring, they should be opened up for sale at affordable prices to help people's livelihood. Therefore, a special request is made to the provincial government to forward this to the Suzhou, Zhejiang, and Anhui Enemy and Puppet Industry Management Office to quickly open up and sell them at affordable prices.</p>
<p>Changshu</p>
<p>Actively Repairing the Changcheng Highway: The highway from Changshu to Jiangyin is currently being actively repaired and may be open to the military in mid-April. The Chengqin Weitu Automobile Company, organized by people from the two counties, has requested the Jiangyin County Government to repair the highway within its borders to Yangshe Town. The Changshu area will soon be built by the county government.</p>
<p>Trying to Plant American Cotton in Huatian: The local Relief Association, in order to improve cotton, is trying to replant American cotton. After investigations in various districts, it was found that 18,000 dan of improved seeds were needed. It has now submitted a request to the Su Ning branch to approve the allocation so that it can be distributed to households and explained the benefits and disadvantages, with the aim of increasing production.</p>
<p>Wuxi</p>
<p>Puppet Township Chiefs Shortchange Military Rice</p>
<p>The County Finance Rectification Committee found that the puppet township chiefs and heads of neighborhoods in the county during the enemy's occupation collected military rice and military wheat. The amount of rice and wheat shortchanged was considerable. Although the districts were ordered to thoroughly investigate, no reports have been received. A further meeting has been held to order the districts to investigate and recover the rice and wheat to increase public revenue.</p>
<p>Zhenjiang: Improving the Lives of Public School Teachers and Staff</p>
<p>The Jiangsu provincial authorities, in order to understand the difficult lives of public school teachers and staff, have decided to first temporarily transfer funds from other political expenses before the central government allocates funds for adjusting the treatment of public school teachers and staff in provincial-level agencies for February and March (salaries will be increased by 11,000 times, and the basic living allowance will be 35,000 yuan). With the approval of the central government through the Food and Grain Office, 20,000 piculs of rice will be allocated under the military grain purchase project. From March to July, public school teachers and staff will be able to purchase five pecks of rice for 3,000 yuan, and regiment police will be able to purchase two pecks of rice for 1,200 yuan.</p>
<p>Developing Agricultural Tools to Improve Agriculture: The UNRRA Su Ning branch, in order to revive the rural areas after the war, specially negotiated with the UNRRA Su Ning district office to request the allocation of 3,000 piculs of American cotton seeds, 240,000 piculs of chemical fertilizers, 15,000 piculs of agricultural tools, and 2,600 catties of vegetable seeds, which will be distributed to farmers in various places at half price or free of charge to improve agricultural production. The divided areas are: 1. Tongfu District, 2. Xuhai District and the two cities of Lianyungang and Xuzhou, 3. Jianghuai District, 4. Jingyi District, 5. Jinghu District, and Shanghai City.</p>
<p>Jiangyin</p>
<p>Prolonged Rain Causes Disaster and River Works to Stop</p>
<p>The Dongheng River has not been dredged for many years, which is related to the farmland water conservancy of the Eastern Township. After the Relief Association and the County Government planned and submitted a request to the Relief Association Su Ning branch, the dam was cut off and the water was drained. The lower level was excavated. Unexpectedly, since the beginning of spring, there has been a disaster of prolonged rain, which has lasted for more than 20 days and has not yet cleared. Low-lying fields have become swamps, and mountain floods have broken out, causing a sea of water in the Heng River, making it impossible to excavate. The wheat seedlings have also withered and turned yellow, affecting the small harvest, which is worrying.</p>
<p>Nantong: The Division Forbids Soldiers to Watch Plays: Since the arrival of the 105th Division of the National Army in Tongjing, the division commander, Liu, has recently issued an order prohibiting soldiers from watching plays. Officers are allowed to purchase tickets to watch plays during the day, but regardless of officers or soldiers, they are prohibited from entering the theaters at night. Teams are dispatched to maintain order in the theater, and military discipline is extremely good. Captain Luo Yan, a staff officer of the Political Department of the division, has been stationed at the Military-Civilian Cooperation Station in the city to assist the station in handling military-civilian cooperation work.</p>
<p>Jiaxing</p>
<p>Townspeople Riot and Chiefs Suffer</p>
<p>Sun Zhenchang, chief of the sixth neighborhood of Jiaxi Township, Xinshou Town, Jiaxing, and Qian Sanyun, chief of the eleventh neighborhood, collected excessive public grain during the enemy and puppet period. Recently, the people of the neighborhoods crowded to the chiefs' houses to demand settlement. The houses of the two chiefs were completely demolished, and Sun and Qian were eventually captured. Upon hearing the news, the authorities sent Secretary Li and Luo, the captain of the Self-Defense Brigade, and Xu, the director of the Police Bureau, to appease them. However, before the matter was settled, the ninth neighborhood of Fuli Township, which is adjacent to the township, had another incident. The townspeople went to the chief's home to demand the return of the excessive military and public grain. The chief opened fire to threaten them, which aroused public anger and almost led to a murder case.</p>
<p>Guangming</p>
<p>List of County Councilors Determined: The list of county councilors for the County Temporary Council has been approved by the 616th Committee of the Anhui Provincial Government. The chairman is Hu Jutan, the vice-chairman is Wan Zhenwu, there are ten councilors, and four alternates. It is also heard that Chairman Li has sent a telegram to find a venue for the meeting and sent personnel to actively prepare for its establishment as soon as possible.</p>

<p>In order to report on the organization and interrogation procedures of this military tribunal, the department held a tea party yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM to receive reporters. Yang Gangzhang, Staff Officer of the Command Post, and Zhang Yulin, Director of the Press Office, presided over the event. First, Xu Zhenqiu, Director of the Military Law Department of the Command, reported on the establishment process, stating that the list of war criminals currently ordered by the Military Command Department totals seven batches.

<h3>Accused of Colluding with the Enemy: Yin Dingyi on Trial</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Tilanqiao High Court Criminal Division, presided over by Judge Cai Jun at 3:00 PM yesterday, investigated Yin Dingyi, 57 years old, from Sichuan. On December 18, 1939, his son Yin Maoling was arrested and executed by secret agents at 76 Jessfield Road, leading to his own imprisonment for three months. After his release, the Wang puppet regime, recognizing his past position in the military, appointed him as a lieutenant general staff officer. Therefore, he is being prosecuted under Article 2, Section 1 of the Punishment of Traitors Act. However, according to Yin, he did not go to Nanjing to accept the official position. Both he and his son were intelligence officers under Li Mingyang, the current Deputy Commander of the Eleventh War Zone and Commander-in-Chief of the Yangtze River Downstream Advance Army, during the enemy occupation. He claims he was not a traitor and served underground, listing various "evidence." He also stated that his hired lawyer is helping him on a pro bono basis. The judge, considering the evidence in the case insufficient, adjourned the hearing to continue the interrogation of Yin Dingyi regarding the charge of colluding with the enemy.</p>

<p>Japanese Forced to Sign Confession</p>
<h3>US Military Continues Trial of Japanese War Criminals; Nelson Still Testifies</h3>
<p>Japanese Forced to Sign Confession</p>
<p>Sentencing of American Pilots to Death</p>
<p>The US military tribunal established by the US War Crimes Trial Commission continued the trial yesterday of former Japanese 13th Army Commander Lieutenant General Sawada Shigeru, and Wakou Yuuki, Taterakawa Tsugiro, Okahata Hidehira and others, for the murder of American airmen of the Doolittle Raid that bombed Tokyo. Captain Nelson, an American pilot who participated in the bombing, continued to testify in court. According to his testimony, after being captured by the Japanese, they were subjected to trial and forced to sign confessions admitting to bombing hospitals, school districts, charitable organizations, and churches in Tokyo. At the time, they were unaware of the content and were simply forced to sign Japanese documents. The Japanese then used these documents as evidence to convict the pilots. They had no opportunity to defend themselves. The court set up by the Japanese military initially sentenced them to death, but the sentence was later commuted to life imprisonment by order of the Japanese Emperor. Defense lawyers Lieutenant Colonel Bottini and Captain Flowers sought to clarify two points: (1) the pilots had bombed non-military areas, and (2) they signed the confessions admitting to bombing military areas. Therefore, they were not forced to sign. Bottini later asked Nelson if he harbored great resentment, hoping to prove that Nelson might have bombed non-military targets in Tokyo. But Nelson's answer was excellent: "My feelings toward the Japanese are no different from my feelings toward garbage." The battle of arguments concluded at 4:30 PM. Lieutenant Colonel Kurtz then testified, proving the authenticity of the evidence he collected. The defendants remained quiet and expressionless in court. The court is scheduled to resume the trial at 9:00 AM today.</p>

<h3>Household Heads are Responsible for Assisting in Drug Prohibition; Failure to Report Will Result in Joint Punishment</h3>
<p>Regarding the elimination of opium smoking in this city, those who smoke are required to register for self-reform with the police station in charge by the end of March and to quit by the end of June.

At the same time, the district offices should expand publicity on the elimination of opium and strictly urge opium addicts in their jurisdictions to register with the police station within the deadline.</p>
<h3>Continuous Rain is Annoying, but Reduced Mildew Season is Welcome; Northeasterly Winds Arise; The Weather Will Clear Up</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The weather has not been good since the 23rd of last month. Even when it doesn't rain, there is no sun. The continuous spring rain is maddening. Farmers are worried that excessive rain will damage their crops and urgently need sunshine. Anyone who has to go outside every day hates the rain the most. So, when will the weather clear up? This question needs to be asked of the heavens. The reporter is no exception and had to visit the Shanghai Meteorological Observatory of the Central Meteorological Bureau. Coincidentally, Director Zheng Zizheng was also troubled by the prolonged rain. He said: "Six inches and seven tenths of rain have accumulated in the past three weeks. Although the sun appeared briefly on the 12th of this month, it was quickly covered by dark clouds. It snowed again on the 15th, and there were thunderstorms on the 17th and 18th." Director Zheng also said: "The winter was not cold because warm air enveloped the Yangtze River area. Since the beginning of spring, cold air from North China has flowed south, and the cold and warm air masses meet in the Yangtze River basin, causing continuous rain. However, the northeasterly wind has recently risen, and the weather is improving, and will likely clear up, but the temperature will inevitably drop. It is also predicted that the mildew season this year may be reduced as a result."</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper] Zhao Fugui, a native of Anhui, living at 35 Shoupin Lane, Huade Road, Dalian Bay Road, is a worker at Yizhong Tobacco Company. Yesterday afternoon, he had a dispute with his second wife, Pan Yushu, over renting a house. Pan reported it to the Changyang Road Sub-Station of the Yulin Road Precinct, which sent police officer No. 1207 to mediate without success.

Not long after, Patrol Officer Duan received a report and led four police officers to rush to the scene, but Zhao had gathered a group of people and surrounded Patrol Officer Duan, seizing his official firearm. As a last resort, Patrol Officer Duan drew his gun and fired a shot into the ground. The bullet ricocheted off the cement floor, grazing Zhao's left leg, fortunately causing only minor injuries. Two accomplices were captured on the spot and taken to the precinct for investigation. The injured Zhao was sent to the police hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3>Robbery and Murder Case Cracked</h3>

<h3>Resentment Over Failure to Borrow; Gathering Accomplices to Kidnap and Murder</h3>
<p>The Murderers in Zhuzhai Town Have Been Arrested</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Huang Youkang (style name Chengbo), 41 years old, a local resident, worked in the Jinpu Railway Bureau before the war. After the outbreak of the Pacific War, Huang resigned from his job and returned to his hometown, Zhuzhai Town, to do business because he was unwilling to participate in the puppet organization. On the 14th day of the third month of the lunar calendar in 1945, bandits Wu Bosheng and Shi Jingen led nine accomplices to Wangwo, forced him to leave, and shot him at the Panzhong Bridge, about one mile east of the town. He was shot twice in the face and stabbed twice in the throat, a tragic death. The reason was that Wang Shan was engaged in business and had accumulated wealth, which was coveted by the bandits, who had repeatedly failed to borrow money from him, leading to resentment. After the incident, the murderers fled without a trace. At that time, the family members were unable to seek justice due to the enemy puppet regime. However, the bandits continued to operate in the Qinghu Road area, robbing traveling merchants, committing numerous crimes. On the 15th of this month, Chen Hongjun, the leader of the Third Squad of the Wujiagang Defense Group in the West Shanghai District, led his team members to arrest them in the nearby villages, took them for interrogation, and transferred them to the Zhuzhai Town Police Sub-Station, which transferred them to the Xinjing Precinct for detention. It is reported that Wu Bosheng and others confessed to the shooting of Huang Youkang. Huang's wife, Zhang Huiying, went to the precinct to identify them without error and confronted them with all the facts. Now, Huang Zhang Huiying and her son Guozheng have jointly submitted a petition to Director Xuan of the Municipal Police Bureau, requesting that they be severely punished according to the law to uphold human life.</p>

<h3>Japanese Emperor Should Be Listed as a War Criminal: Views Expressed by Mr. Kaji Wataru, Leader of the Japanese Anti-War League</h3>
<p>— Our Correspondent, Canglong</p>
<p>"The Japanese Emperor should be listed as one of the war criminals. He bears the greatest responsibility for this war disaster. Because the Emperor had absolute power to control this war disaster, but he did not try to stop it... The misfortunes and hunger of Japan during the war were all brought about by the Emperor system, so the Emperor system should definitely be abolished, but the handling should be cautious..."</p>
<p>Yesterday at six o'clock in the afternoon, a group of reporters crowded into a small room on the fourth floor of the Great China Hotel, surrounding Mr. Kaji Wataru (see picture), leader of the Japanese Anti-War League who had just flown in from Chongqing. Questions were fired at him like a string of pearls. When the focus of the conversation shifted to the Emperor system, he expressed the above view without hesitation. His calm demeanor and the incisive edge of his arguments demonstrated the strength of his anti-war will. He said that after this war disaster, the Japanese people have deeply felt the need for democracy. It is estimated that 60% to 70% of the Japanese people support democracy. As long as they can unite, they should be able to achieve a democratic and peaceful Japan. Therefore, he firmly believes that the Japanese nation will be able to transform Japan, burying the past in the ruins and debris. However, Kaji Wataru wants to cultivate new buds of Japanese democracy on this foundation. He is hurrying back to do some cultivation work. Regarding the general election scheduled for April 10 of this year, Mr. Kaji believes that the time is a bit too pressing. He fears that the Japanese people are not prepared enough for the election and hopes that the time can be extended. He also hopes that under the premise of democracy, all Japanese political parties should jointly cooperate. They should prepare more for the election, but they should not engage in unwarranted attacks! When talking about the future relationship between China and Japan, Mr. Kaji said: Both China and Japan are great nations. Together with India, Indonesia, and other nations, their population accounts for half of the world's population. Therefore, without peace between the two major nations of China and Japan in East Asia, the liberation of East Asia is impossible. In the past, a small number of Japanese aggressive elements and privileged classes disrupted the national relationship between China and Japan. Now, we should try to reconnect them again, so that in the future, in terms of culture, education, and technology, we can have satisfactory relationships and foundations to realize the relationship between the national governments of China and Japan! The reporter could not help but ask him about his impression of China. His bright and spirited eyes flickered, revealing a smile, and he said: "China is the benefactor of my life. I feel extremely honored to be able to participate in this liberation war of East Asia. China has 450 million people and is a great nation. China's future is full of hope and will surely create a new era for East Asia. China's happiness will be enough to influence the happiness of East Asia and also enough to influence the happiness of Japan!" For eight years, Kaji Wataru has stood on the same front as China's resistance against Japan, launching anti-war propaganda against Japan. From 1938 to 1939, when the Anti-War League had not yet been established, he went to Japanese prisoner-of-war camps in Hunan and Chongqing to conduct propaganda. He collected his work from this stage and completed a reportage, "A Record of Peace Village." On December 25, 1939, the Anti-War League was established, and he served as its leader. He then took seven Japanese comrades to work in the South China area. At that time, the Japanese army was attacking Nanning. They went in and out of the front lines with the Chinese army, actively launching anti-war propaganda against Japan. The work experience is collected in a collection called "My Seven People." In 1944, he also worked with the Chinese army in Changde, Hunan, and Yichang, Hubei, to conduct propaganda against the Japanese army. He sent daily reports to Chongqing, which were collected into a book called "Frontline Correspondence." The above are just some of his major services to China during the war. However, before coming to China, he was arrested and imprisoned as many as 26 times in Japan from 1928 to 1935 because he often participated in gatherings of socialist believers! Finally, the reporter congratulated him on his appointment as General MacArthur's political advisor. He said: He received this news from the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs last September, but he has not yet received a formal instruction from General MacArthur. Flying to Shanghai with him this time were his wife, Chii Sachiko, two children, and four staff members. Unfortunately, yesterday morning, his four-year-old child was looking out of the window of his fourth-floor room when he accidentally fell to the street, injuring his head. He was sent to Renji Hospital at 11 o'clock, but he was already unconscious and lost his child! However, when Kaji Wataru met with reporters, there was no trace of sadness on his face. He is burning with a torch to create a new democratic Japan. The brilliance and enthusiasm of this fire are enough to cover up all the old and new wounds he has suffered in the past eight years!</p>

<h3>Decreased Black Market Demand, Gold Prices Gradually Decline, Both Old and New Hong Kong Dollars Rebound</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market initially stabilized but then weakened. The Bank of China still allocated 595 bars at the original price of 1.62 million, so the supply was relatively smooth, but it was not easy to sell. After a detailed explanation of the US gold price issue by this newspaper, people's minds gradually stabilized. In the afternoon, it weakened further. The market opened with a slight drop at around 1.65 million, but this price could not be sustained for long and gradually declined slightly. The market price was slightly higher than the Bank of China's allocation price, and all 595 registered bars were approved. Some chips felt a bit abundant, and there was less activity from buyers in the black market. As a result, it appeared weak, and hot money turned to cold medicine. At noon, it had broken through the 1.6 million mark. In the afternoon, it reached 1.58 million, and the excess was cleared. In the end, it remained below 1.6 million. As a result, it closed about 65,000 lower than the previous close. Gold jewelry in silver shops was listed at 173,000 yuan, and silver at 1,600 yuan. Silver dollars were stable, and the hidden discount rate was 1.8 to 3.2 cents. The Bank of China's controlled prices were reasonable, and speculators were unwilling to step forward in today's market. The number of those who gave up increased daily, and the range of fluctuations will become narrower.</p>
<p>Foreign currency US dollars were extremely sluggish, and the gold market declined. In the afternoon, it also became tired. It opened at 2030 yuan and struggled for a long time around 2010 yuan. At noon, it had fallen back into the 2000 yuan range. As a result, it fell back 40 yuan. Old Hong Kong dollars were still in demand due to Hong Kong telegrams. As a result, it rebounded another 5 yuan. New dollars were initially flat, hovering around the previous close. In the afternoon, it rose slightly. As a result, 36-year dollars rose by 3 yuan, and 37-year dollars rose by 2 yuan. The US exchange rate remained unchanged. Hong Kong telegrams were 46 yuan, and rupees were 560 yuan, and there were still settlements.</p>
<h3>Government Bonds Weaken, Chinese Stocks Stop Falling and Rise</h3>
<p>Government bonds were lackluster yesterday, with little change. Mature type C bonds fluctuated by only a little over 100 yuan, going from strong to weak in the middle. As a result, each bond fell slightly by 30 yuan to 50 yuan. Chinese stocks stopped falling and rose. There was no way out for speculative funds. The Savings Bank Law promulgated by the authorities stipulates that marketable securities of production enterprises should account for 40% of the reserve, and the market situation gradually improved. However, the industry was preparing to deliver foreign shares purchased the day before yesterday (foreign shares are settled the day after purchase), and a large amount of liquidation was absorbed by speculative funds outside the industry. As a result, it gradually improved from low to high. However, the process was much less inferior to Mei Ya. As a result, the afternoon close was 50 yuan better than Yongsha and 100 yuan better than Mei Ya. Jingfu and other small hot stocks were each 5 yuan to 7 yuan better. In the afternoon, those who delivered the day after tomorrow raised their prices. Yongsha was 3900 yuan, Mei Ya was 3050 yuan, and Jingfu was 235 yuan or more. The initial opening of the hot foreign stock market was stable, with Yisha above 8100 yuan, but it was soon suppressed by the inventory sold by the bulls. Large stocks fell back half a percent after rising high. Small stocks of steel and paper rose a lot due to the high bids the night before, and although there were dips after the rise, they were still 10% better than before.</p>
<h3>Sino-British Exchange Rate</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, March 19: The Bank of England confirms that there is no official market price for exchange with China. Off-market transactions are being conducted at 5,550 yuan per pound.</p>
<h3>Rice Prices Continue to Rise, Food Problem is Serious</h3>
<p>The rice market was cloudy and goods were scarce, and shops were still eager. Japonica and indica rice continued to increase by 2,000 yuan. White yuan and hidden yuan rose by another 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. Flour exports were stagnant, but local demand was slightly improved, and prices were firm. The oil market was quite active in sales, and continued to rise by more than 2,000 yuan. Soybean cake retail sales were very active and rose by another 300 to 400 yuan. Bran's inland sales were lively, and the market was stable. Soybeans trended mediocre.</p>
<p>Furthermore, according to news from the local rice market, a total of 7,101 dan of edible rice arrived yesterday. The types are as follows: 3,030 dan of white japonica, 75 dan of mutton indica, 60 dan of Baiyuan, 1,891 dan of thin rice, 453 dan of Du indica, 18 dan of Xian Yuan, and 1,574 dan of early rice. More than 1,000 pieces of Taiwanese tea arrived.</p>
<h3>UNRRA Ships Wheat to Tianjin</h3>
<p>Taiwanese tea arrives with more than 1000 cases</p>
<p>The Taikoo Company's Shandong vessel will sail to Tianjin this afternoon, carrying more than 16,000 bags of UNRRA wheat and 7,000 cases of tea, which are commercial goods. Tea was shipped from Taiwan, and the Haisu vessel arrived in Shanghai from Taiwan yesterday, carrying 1,900 cases. The Jiangjian vessel arrived in Shanghai from Oujiang and Ningbo yesterday morning. In addition to a large batch of wooden boards loaded from Wenzhou, the vessel also had more than 600 bags of native sugar.</p>
<h3>Yarn Prices Decline, Spot Cotton Trading Still Active</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market took a sharp turn for the worse. In the early morning, amidst a wave of selling, prices gradually fell. Shuangma once approached one million, and 16-count Guangming also fell to near 800,000, a drop of 70,000 to 80,000 yuan compared to the previous day. People's minds were still tired, because the finished products of cloth mills and weaving mills were also feeling sluggish. The Textile Construction Company opened the sale of nine kinds of patterned cotton cloth and eleven kinds of American cloth yesterday. It will open the sale of woolen products today.</p>
<p>Yesterday, New York American cotton reported a rise of 12 to 15 points, with the recent US dollar at 26.75, the forward at 26.54, and the spot Middling at 27.34. The local spot cotton market was flat and tired, but the transaction was very smooth. The Textile Construction Company, which took over the Japanese yarn factory, needs cotton urgently, and is procuring 2,600 to 2,700 bales of fine velvet raw materials such as US Middling Changde flower and Brazilian flower. The Shenxin Yarn Factory continued to purchase 700 to 800 bales of Zhenhai Tijian.</p>
<h3>UNRRA Allocates Cotton, China Receives 510,000 Bales</h3>
<p>[Reuters, New York, March 19] According to the Wall Street Journal, the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) has purchased approximately 846,000 bales of cotton to aid countries that have suffered war losses, of which 35,000 bales are supplied by India. According to UNRRA's allocation plan, China will receive the largest amount, a total of 510,000 bales.</p>
<h3>White Lead Wire Sees a Slight Turnaround</h3>
<p>Since new white lead wire arrived in port in mid-March, the market has gradually declined. For more than three weeks, there was no improvement. Until recently, there was a slight turnaround, and hard wire was even more popular due to its smaller quantity. Recently, the market price for sizes 8 and 10 is 80,000 yuan per dan, sizes 12 and 14 are 90,000 yuan, and size 16 is 120,000 yuan. As for fine patterns such as size 20, 200,000 yuan per dan is required. Hard wire is about 20% to 30% higher than the above prices.</p>
<h3>Asphalt Sales Market is Dull</h3>
<p>Due to the rainy weather, the candle sales market has been greatly reduced, which has a significant impact on the asphalt market. Although small soap factories have slightly increased their purchases, they are all taking second- and third-class goods. High-quality goods such as Heben and Neiping oil are all sluggish. Fortunately, the source of high-quality oil is not much, so although the surface seems to lack energy, the content is still solid. And in terms of various oils, asphalt is uniquely cheap. Once the spring sales are launched, the future is very hopeful. However, railway freight rates have recently increased threefold, and costs have increased a lot, so sales prices have to be increased accordingly. The wholesale prices of merchants are listed below: Heben 58,000 yuan, Neiping 50,000 yuan, Lanjiao 46,000 yuan, and ordinary Lan oil 42,000 to 43,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Market Price of White Coal Slag and Anthracite Coal Continues to Decline</h3>
<p>The coal market is stable only for white coal lumps and small pieces of coal. White coal slag and anthracite coal continue the previous trend, and the industry continues to be bearish. Therefore, the market was shrouded in a selling atmosphere from the start, and prices continued to fall step by step, collapsing. Due to the rain, firewood and charcoal are still scarce, and the market situation is firm. It is expected that if the weather is sunny and smooth in the future, the arrival of goods will be strong, and the market price will inevitably fall sharply.</p>
<h3>Caustic Soda Collapses, Industrial Raw Materials Pour In</h3>
<p>This city's industrial raw materials have been exhausted for a long time. Recently, a batch of caustic soda and bleaching spirit have been imported from Brunner Mond. Then, American merchants shipped various industrial raw materials from Manila to Shanghai. Although the number is not very large, general raw material merchants and hoarders are showing a weak and soft heart. Therefore, the goods that have arrived but have not been unloaded and the so-called short-term throwaway goods that are still on the way are rushing to sell them first, resulting in a consistent collapse in prices. Recently, the market price of American caustic soda has even been made at 250,000 yuan per barrel, which is only a quarter of the previous week's market price. Other hoarded goods such as bleaching powder, zinc gas powder, and fertilizer powder have also fallen sharply. It is heard that due to the lack of accurate calculations of shipping schedules and costs for American exports of raw materials, it is difficult to complete orders for May and June between Shanghai and New York.</p>
<h3>Tea Merchants' Loans: Shanghai Branch of the Four Banks Approves More Than 2 Billion Yuan, Still Far Short of the Application Amount. Tea Association is Ready for Establishment.</h3>
<p>Tea is a major export product of our country. Due to the upcoming tea season, the tea industry groups have sent telegrams to the Second Plenary Session and Chairman Chiang to request assistance in order to revitalize China's tea industry and strive for international trade. According to agricultural economist (tea industry tycoon) Sun Xiaocun, 23 tea merchants applied to the Shanghai branch of the Four Joint Banks for purchase loans, using tea, gold, and real estate as collateral. The total application amount reached 4.2 billion yuan. The Shanghai branch of the Four Joint Banks has discussed it at a routine meeting. However, the Four Joint Banks hope to only use tea as collateral. Although it has been approved, the total approved amount is only more than 2 billion yuan, and it has been submitted by the Shanghai branch of the Four Joint Banks to the head office for approval. However, the number is extremely small, which is far from the current national loan amount of 100 billion yuan. Therefore, applications are still being actively pursued. It is also learned that in order to revitalize China's tea, develop foreign trade, and assist the government's economic construction, tea industry tycoons Shou Jingwei, Wu Juenong, Ye Shichang, Wang Zhenhuan, and Sun Xiaocun have launched the organization of the China Tea Association. After two joint meetings of the preparation members, the preparations are basically in place, and members are being publicly solicited recently. It is heard that the inaugural meeting is scheduled to be held in Shanghai on April 1. In the future, national tea merchants will have a sound and unified organization, and it is understood that they will participate in the first post-war World Tea Exhibition held in London, England this autumn.</p>
<h3>Foreign Companies Accept Orders, Great Progress in American-Made Spinning Machines, 400,000 Spindles Have Been Ordered</h3>
<p>The war industries of the United States, Britain, and other countries have mostly shifted to general production and manufacturing industries. Machines can be exported in a short period of time, so foreign companies in China are becoming more active and have begun to accept orders. It is heard that the larger industrial machinery transactions in Shanghai are for textile machinery, such as Weili Han Shenchang of the United States and Anli and Ping of Britain, each of which has orders for sale. American-made spinning machines have made progress in manufacturing technology, with simple and flexible machine components and processes. The progress is that the drafting is changed to large drafting, and the steel collar of the spinning machine is also enlarged to two inches and two and four-tenths inches. In the spinning part, the process was originally three times, but now it can be used only once to the spinning machine. The production volume of this new type of spinning machine is 20% higher than that of the various spinning machines ten years ago (based on the standard of spinning 20-count yarn, one spindle can produce 1.2 pounds of yarn per 24 hours). The saving of labor is half less than the previous type (the former type machine requires 300 direct labor per 10,000 spindles, while the new machine only needs 150). It is heard that British textile experts have recently traveled to the United States to conduct inspections to borrow money, because American-made spinning machines have the above-mentioned advantages, and the price is also higher than British-made machines. Each 10,000 spindles (flower clearing, steel wire, combing, roving, spinning complete set) is priced at 450,000 US dollars, delivered in ten months (this is the fastest delivery for foreign machines), and freight and insurance are borne by the buyer. British-made spinning machines are cheaper, each 10,000 spindles is 80,000 to 90,000 pounds, but the delivery period takes about 30 months to start loading. As for the ordering procedures, British and American merchants are mostly similar. After the ordering party signs an ordering agreement with each line, they will fulfill the agreement and handle it. A deposit of 15% is paid at the time of ordering, 25% is paid when manufacturing starts, and 60% is paid after manufacturing is completed, test-driven and boxed.</p>
<p>The Swiss Ritter spinning machine factory also has an agent in Shanghai that can accept orders, but because the delivery time cannot be determined, there are few buyers. British and Indian merchants who operate the textile machinery industry in India also have representatives coming to Shanghai to sell old-fashioned spinning machines left in India. The price is slightly cheaper than new-style machines. It is heard that several factories in this city have negotiated with them, and a deal may be signed in the short term. It is found that the major textile enterprises in our country have ordered more than 400,000 yarn spindles from the United States and Britain in the past six months, of which Shenxin purchased the most, about 170,000 spindles. Yufeng Yarn Factory and Yuhua system factories have also ordered a lot. The number of people who are now negotiating is becoming more and more active. According to a textile expert, the output of this old type of spinning machine is weak and consumes labor. After the American and British new machines are shipped to China and installed in large quantities, they will inevitably become scrap iron within three or five years. Therefore, ordering manufacturers should carefully consider.</p>

Flying Stone Breaks Principal's Head.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou Normal School A Full-Scale Brawl</h3>
<p>Flying Stone Breaks Principal's Head</p>
<p>[Our Hangzhou Correspondent] A major disturbance occurred at the Hangzhou Normal School yesterday (the 17th) at 4:00 PM. It is reported that during a school affairs meeting the day before yesterday, when discussing the issue of teachers' overdue public grain and newly collected student meal expenses, the school principal, Zhu Wenzhi, insisted that the overdue public grain for teachers would not be issued and that the newly collected student meal fees would continue to be increased. All the teachers believed that since the overdue public grain had already been received by the school, it should be issued as usual, and that the student meal fees should not be arbitrarily increased because most of the students at the school were poor and could not afford it, in accordance with the Ministry's order. This led to a heated debate. In the end, Principal Zhu's arrogant attitude led to an argument with the teachers on the spot, and they parted unhappily, with no results from the meeting. Yesterday at 4:00 PM, when the school was about to have dinner, Principal Zhu summoned all the students for a speech, but his words seemed unreasonable. Some students went on stage to argue, but unexpectedly, a full-scale brawl broke out. Principal Zhu's head was hit by a flying stone, and the director of student affairs immediately covered his head with his hand, which was stained with blood. Seeing the situation was not good, Principal Zhu took the opportunity to leave. The students of the school urgently convened an emergency meeting of the student council, and have been on strike since yesterday. If a reasonable solution is not reached, they plan not to resume classes. It is also reported that Principal Zhu was injured in the head and was immediately taken to the Provincial Hospital for treatment, and the Education Department has been requested to send personnel to investigate thoroughly.

<h3>Standards for Establishing Private Middle Schools Require Sufficient Funds to Cover Recurring Expenses; Different from Standards Set Before the War</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent] Before the Anti-Japanese War, the Ministry of Education's standards for assets and capital (funds) required for the establishment of private schools in various provinces and cities were based on the lower cost of living and stable prices at the time, and specific amounts were set, such as 50,000 or 100,000 yuan, deposited in banks. Upon verification, if the amounts were found to be consistent, the establishment was approved. During the Anti-Japanese War, due to the increased cost of living and fluctuating prices, it was difficult to maintain consistent living standards across different regions. Therefore, a uniform amount for the educational fund could not be set. Instead, a principle was established, allowing the education departments of various provinces and cities to set their own standards based on local conditions and this principle, in order to ensure suitability and avoid difficulties. The principle is that any application to establish a private middle school must demonstrate that the normal interest income from its assets and capital (i.e., the educational fund) is sufficient to cover the recurring expenses of the school before the establishment can be approved. The Ministry of Education stated: As living conditions vary in different regions and prices are subject to change, the amount of assets and capital should also be increased with the times. The local educational administrative authorities should set the standard that is sufficient to cover the school's operating expenses according to the above-mentioned principles set by the Ministry.

<h3>Today's Basketball League Shantou Team Faces Enkas</h3>
<p>South China Fights Jiangwan</p>
<p>The A and Women's groups of the basketball league are coming to an end. There are two games starting at 6:30 PM today, both of which are Division A matches. The Shantou team will play Enkas, and South China will play Jiangwan. Tickets are still 500 yuan. The order is as follows:</p>
<p>Shantou Team—Enkas (A1) 6:30 PM</p>
<p>South China—Jiangwan (A1) 7:30 PM</p>
<p>Since Ma Canxi left Shanghai, the Shantou team's performance has inevitably declined, as they lack a central figure. Enkas is known for its courage, so the Shantou team should make more use of strategy. South China has been improving recently, and newcomer He Hanfu, after several training sessions, has gradually been able to perform well. Today's match against Jiangwan will definitely be intense and exciting.</p>

<p>Educational Thesis</p>
<h3>Review of Elementary School Art Curriculum Standards</h3>
<p>— Wen Zhaotong</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education announced the "Revised Elementary School Art Curriculum Standards" in July of the 25th year of the Republic of China (1936). At that time, I published a review article in the Jiangsu Provincial Elementary School Teachers' Semi-Monthly Journal, Volume 4, Issue 5, pointing out its characteristics: (1) starting from local culture; (2) developing children's creative abilities as much as possible; (3) aiming at the application of daily life. Recently, I saw the "Elementary School Drawing Curriculum Standards" announced in October of the 31st year of the Republic of China (1942), and compared it with the former. I seem to have discovered a regression in Chinese elementary school art education, which is also the motivation for me to write this article.</p>
<p>In the revision process, it was said that "the elementary school curriculum is the center of all educational facilities in elementary school, including the guidance of the entire children's life, and is not narrowly defined as the education of a certain subject." It also said: "According to the definition of the above curriculum, the curriculum of the elementary school department of national education can be analyzed into three major trainings: (1) moral training, (2) physical training, (3) cognitive training. That is, the entire education facility of elementary school should take the three major trainings of morality, physique, and intelligence as the central goal." Therefore, "Fine Arts" was changed to "Drawing" and incorporated into "Knowledge and Skills."</p>
<p>Since the major premise has been determined in this way, the drawing curriculum has become the following content:</p>
<p>(1) Emphasize technical training;</p>
<p>(2) Emphasize basic exercises;</p>
<p>(3) Cancel research assignments;</p>
<p>(4) Disregard the beautification of life.</p>
<p>For the sake of economic space, I don't want to specifically excerpt the content, but I always have a few questions: In the teaching material outline, in the third item of the third and fourth grades, it is stipulated that "use drawing books to compile the most basic drawing methods," isn't this going to fall into the danger of copying?</p>
<p>Secondly, the teaching essentials also stipulate that "basic drawing exercises should be started in the lower grades." Implementing it in this way requires children in the lower grades to draw correctly and skillfully, which not only violates learning psychology. Furthermore, I want to ask: With such training, will every citizen possibly become a technically skilled painter? The result is indeed a waste.</p>
<p>What exactly is the purpose of elementary school art education? If you only want to train drawing skills, then this "Drawing Curriculum Standards" published in this revision may be more reasonable, but what we require of every child is to have an eye to distinguish between beauty and ugliness, a skill to beautify life, as for the development of creativity, after all, it is a secondary position. Moreover, merely having stereotyped basic technical exercises will inhibit self-expression and free creation.</p>
<p>If implemented according to such standards, it is very likely to completely frustrate and eliminate the human nature of loving beauty and the interest in aesthetics. What role does the training of rigid painters play in the entire national education? Finally, my opinion is that "Fine Arts" should be restored in the middle and high grades, and "Work" should be restored in the lower grades to expand the scope of operations. It would be best to combine the life crafts with artistic properties in "Manual Arts" to form a complete "Formative Education" system, using "cultivating appreciation" and "developing creation" as means, so that every citizen can improve their own lives to tend to beautification. I strongly oppose technical training, especially starting from the lower grades. Because "drawing technique" is definitely not the core of modern art education, it is also far from "life curriculum" and "behavior curriculum." Rather than taking "drawing" as a training in "knowledge and skills," it is better to restore "Fine Arts" and use it as a training in "moral behavior."</p>

<h3>Talks with Endner: Our Reporter: China is Stepping onto a Turning Point, Should Open its Doors</h3>
<p>"Mr. Endner is not seeing visitors."</p>
<p>A nurse in the Hong En Hospital "office" told me this. I said to her: I am a reporter. Didn't Mr. Endner receive newspaper reporters yesterday?</p>
<p>She laughed and said, "But he is not seeing visitors 'today'."</p>
<p>I said, I want to try. She said I could go to the third floor and try my luck.</p>
<p>On the doorknob of room 300 on the third floor hung a sign with two large characters written in red ink: "No Vnaitoro"!</p>
<p>I thought: It doesn't matter if I get rejected anyway, so I'll give it a try. A Chinese nurse happened to come out of the ward, so I asked her to hand my business card in. She said, "The hospital is in disarray, and visitors are only allowed from 2 to 4 PM. I think you should come at noon."</p>
<p>It doesn't matter if I get rejected, luck will eventually come.</p>
<p>She finally handed in my business card. When she came out, she said, "Mr. Endner can see you."</p>
<p>Mr. Endner was lying high in bed, his back propped up with pillows. He was wearing a gray cardigan with a Chinese-style front, his complexion was quite ruddy, and his eagle eyes behind his glasses sparkled. On the small table in front of him were a cup of steaming coffee, a glass of water, some blank paper, and a pencil. The paper was already covered in hasty writing. Two English newspapers were scattered on the quilt. The room was warmly heated, and Mr. Endner seemed to be in a good mood.</p>
<p>He said, "I feel much more comfortable today. I was really tired yesterday—really tired. The flight wasn't very long, and the plane was very comfortable, but my..." He gently patted his left chest and coughed. This cough was a symptom of his illness. He said, "I wanted to come a long time ago. I struggled to get out of bed only last Friday and took the plane at 8 PM."</p>
<p>He had apparently read the news in the paper that Madame Chiang Kai-shek was sending a special plane to see him, and a satisfied smile appeared on his face when he mentioned it. He really wanted to see Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, but, he murmured, "The Chairman—he's too busy."</p>
<p>Is China Doing Well? Endner Doesn't Dare to Say</p>
<p>Talking about the current situation in China, he said excitedly, "I have been in China for forty-three years, and every day I have longed to see a free China. Now I have finally seen it, and I feel truly relieved! China's current opportunity is once in a lifetime, but can I say that everything is going smoothly? I dare not say. China is at a turning point. It can be said that it can become a strong and prosperous country, but it is not without the possibility of failure. The most important thing is that the rulers must have vision. If I were the ruler of China, the most important thing to do right now is very simple: don't hold narrow prejudices, open the door. China must rely on foreign capital! You have to rely on foreigners to work for you, you should give them some benefits, let them do business and make money in peace."</p>
<p>Li Guochin of Huachang Company Achieves Success in America</p>
<p>He continued, "When the United States was first founded, it also absorbed foreign capital. The first railways in the United States were invested in by British merchants! I saw a tall building in Long Island, Long Island, with large Chinese characters written on it: 'Huachang Trading Company.' The manager is called Li Guochin. They have their own factory, which is very large. During the entire war, they independently undertook all the production entrusted by the US government. Of course, they can have profits, and they have great profits, but they also helped the US government, and the Americans are grateful to them. China also needs a group of these foreign merchants to solve the current difficulties and enable the people to enjoy a better life. Can they still hold on to the narrow anti-foreign ideas of the Boxers of that year?" He clenched his fists excitedly, and in a speech-like posture, said, "You more progressive young reporters should understand this clearly. When it is time to speak, speak up. When it is time to fight for something, fight for it!"</p>
<p>He coughed violently, but the passionate fire burning in his eyes made him suddenly seem younger.</p>
<p>Currently Writing Memoirs, Getting Harder and Harder</p>
<p>I asked him about Salley and his writing of memoirs. He said, "Salley is also a reporter. I got to know him because he came to interview me. I certainly remember a lot of things from the past forty-three years, but a large part of the truth must be kept secret. In Honolulu, three doctors told me: I won't get better. But, even if—" He paused and said dejectedly, "I still can't say. This book, I have already written more than half of it, but it is getting harder and harder to write, and I'm afraid it won't be able to be completed."</p>
<p>We talked about the Xi'an Incident. I said, "You were truly a hero in that incident." He laughed and said, "Zhang Xueliang is indeed not a bad person. Now, it should be time to let him out!"</p>
<p>When I said goodbye, his handshake was firm and strong, and his voice of thanks was still loud and clear, not at all like that of someone suffering from a serious illness. I knew he was struggling—this old man who would never show weakness!</p>
<p>The nurse told me that the doctors currently responsible for treating him are Dr. Blumenfield, a female doctor from Dellfan, and Chen Zongmo, a former surgical expert from Nanjing Central Hospital. Mr. Endner is in good spirits, but he eats very little, only eating bread, oatmeal, and a little soup. I think the next time I come, they probably won't say "Mr. Endner is not seeing visitors" anymore.</p>
<h3>UNRRA's Secretary-General Mooney in Hangzhou</h3>
<p>— Our Newspaper Hangzhou Tenth Day Airmail News, Sent by Sheng Chengshi</p>
<p>With the cooperation of the UNRRA Headquarters, the national relief and rehabilitation effort is gradually unfolding. Mr. Mooney, the Executive Secretary-General of the UNRRA Department, has been ordered by Director Li Meng of the UNRRA to inspect Europe and Asia. After completing his observation in Europe, Mr. Mooney flew to Shanghai on the 26th of last month, stepping onto the first country in Asia. At noon on March 4th, the Shanghai-Hangzhou express train carried this guest from afar, first arriving in Hangzhou, the Zhe-Min District. When the train stopped at the platform, a Canadian in his forties, of medium build with a plump face, stepped out of the carriage. He was Mr. Mooney, representing the UNRRA to assist millions of our suffering compatriots. He brought the enthusiasm of the people of the United Nations to comfort the twenty million compatriots in Zhejiang who had suffered from disasters for eight years.</p>
<p>Children Sing Welcome Songs in the Righteous People Transportation Station</p>
<p>During his short two-day stay in Hangzhou, he participated in the work conference of the Executive Yuan and UNRRA, and was quite satisfied with the spirit of close cooperation between the two parties. When inspecting the Righteous People Transportation Station, he carefully examined the actual conditions of food and lodging in the station. The children raised in the station sang two songs, "Long Live China" and "America is Our Good Friend," to welcome this guest. After inspecting the flour retail outlets and other relief efforts, he visited Chairman Huang of the Provincial Government, representing his Secretary-General, and Mayor Zhou of the Municipal Government, expressing his great pleasure that the provincial and municipal authorities could work together to promote relief efforts. Secretary-General Li specifically requested the UNRRA to help with the two projects of urgently repairing the seawall and restoring the Changxing Coal Mine. Mr. Mooney said that he would personally inspect the seawall, and that in terms of the coal mine, he could help with machinery and personnel after receiving the plan. Mr. Mooney also visited the two major constructions in the province—the Qiantang River Bridge and the Zhakou Power Plant.</p>
<p>A List of Supplies, Promised to Provide as Much as Possible</p>
<p>At a luncheon, Mr. Mooney talked about the destruction of rice shops in Hangzhou last month due to the rice shortage. He said, "Two or three days after the disturbance, the Zhe-Min branch immediately shipped large amounts of flour from Shanghai and immediately held sales at low prices, which quickly dropped the price of flour from over 9,000 yuan per bag to 6,500 yuan. Because countless poor people benefited, the people's hearts were stabilized, which is exactly the purpose that we relief workers are trying to achieve." He also said, "Before leaving Washington to China, the UNRRA and the general American people believed that Chinese agriculture was backward and that chemical fertilizers had never been used, so shipping chemical fertilizers to China would be a waste of resources. After much proof from the UNRRA, the Executive Yuan, and agricultural experts, they finally realized that this view was wrong." He asked UNRRA to ship large amounts of chemical fertilizers to help China. Mr. Mooney's frank and straightforward attitude was deeply touching. It's regrettable that he couldn't inspect the entire Zhejiang Province, otherwise he would have a deeper understanding of the disasters in Zhejiang and Fujian. Fortunately, Director-General Sun has submitted to him a large list of relief supplies needed by the two provinces, and Mr. Mooney promised to provide as much relief as possible.</p>
<p>Inspect the Seawall Project Along the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway</p>
<p>When he returned to Shanghai, in order to see the seawall and the highway for transporting supplies in the future, he took a "Jeep" along the Shanghai-Hangzhou highway on the morning of the 6th, inspecting the emergency repair project of the seawall in Haining, Haiyan, Zhapu. This seawall, which is related to the survival of the people in the southeast, was deeply imprinted in his mind before arriving in Hangzhou. We inspected while getting out of the car in Haining and other places. In total, there were twelve breaches along the way, the smallest was half a li long, and the largest was more than six li long. Mr. Mooney carefully inspected and took many photos near the stone tablet engraved with the "Dan" character of the Thousand Character Classic, which was also a large breach.</p>
<p>Shouldn't be Called Relief, Should be Called Repayment</p>
<p>In the car, Mr. Mooney also mentioned China's contribution in the entire anti-fascist war. He said, "The weight of the sacrifice is incomparable to any country in the United Nations, yet the Chinese people are still enduring suffering and burying themselves in the work of revival, without loudly appealing to the UNRRA. This great spirit is too moving." "Canadian women are loudly shouting: Because they sacrificed so much that they don't even have stockings to wear, they must ask the UNRRA for a large amount of assistance. In fact, Chinese women not only have no stockings to wear, but most of them are also barefoot!" He waved his fist and continued, "So this time I feel that the UNRRA's assistance to China should not be called relief, but repayment." He also said happily, "Zhejiang is the hometown of the great leader Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. In order to respect Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and the people under his leadership, we should make Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's hometown—Zhejiang! Make it more beautiful."</p>
<p>UNRRA Annual Meeting to be Held in China Next Spring</p>
<p>The jeep drove on the muddy and uneven Shanghai-Hangzhou highway. The journey that only took four and a half hours before the war took us twelve hours. We arrived in Shanghai at 8 PM. If the bridges and roads are not improved, driving is very dangerous. At present, it is probably impossible to use this highway to transport large amounts of supplies. When saying goodbye upon arrival in Shanghai, Mr. Mooney smiled and said to the reporter, "I admire West Lake, please convey my regards to Chairman Huang, Secretary-General Li, and Mayor Zhou. I would like to come back to see the beautiful West Lake in the future!" He turned his head and patted the shoulders of the Commissioner Gu and the branch director, saying, "Your director will certainly also help you thank them for me!" We said goodbye, hoping to see each other again, because the annual meeting of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration may be held in China next spring, when Mr. Mooney will come to our country again.</p>
<h3>The Jin City That is Both Quiet and Dynamic</h3>
<p>— Our Newspaper Seventh Day Airmail News, Sent by Zhou Yangquan</p>
<p>(Emerald green and bright red) Chengdu, she is a beautiful and quiet city. Anyone who has been to Chengdu will naturally have the same feeling. Chengdu, she has the grandeur of Beijing and the charm of Jiangnan. If you don't believe it, you can climb the West City Wall. Looking into the distance, you can see the lush green trees in the city, interspersed with snow-white plum blossoms and bright red winter plums. All the pavilions and houses are appearing amidst the emerald green and bright red. You can see a dense wheat field and yellow vegetable fields outside the city. The scattered villages are like a painting and a poem. You will naturally praise this green city.</p>
<p>The life of Chengdu people can truly be called extremely quiet and leisurely. How many tea houses and wine shops are crowded with people? Some people can even brew a pot of flower tea in the morning and sit idly in the tea house for the whole day without leaving. And how many people stroll slowly on Chunxi Road and in the commercial area, visiting every store and observing the large and small goods in each store. They are passing the time without doing anything. Even now, although the Lunar New Year has passed a long time ago, there are still stores that haven't opened for business! Strangely enough, this year, decorating the storefronts has become a trend among the stores along Chunxi Road and Citang Street. One store renovates, and every store renovates. Therefore, the business of mud, water, and carpentry is particularly booming this year. Perhaps it is because the War of Resistance has been won, and they are planning for the long term!</p>
<p>(On the Huaxi Dam) The wind of the Xianglian State has drifted into this peaceful city. On the morning of the 24th of this month, tens of thousands of young people gathered from all directions on the Huaxi Dam in the south of the city. They held an unprecedentedly grand gathering in a tragic, passionate, and intense atmosphere. They demanded "Return our Northeast Rivers and Mountains," demanded "Protect North China with Iron Blood," and demanded "The Soviet Union to Abide by the Treaty and Immediately Withdraw Troops from the Northeast." Their purpose is pure, their demands are simple, and their actions are great. At 10:30 AM, they set off from the square to parade and demonstrate.</p>
<p>(Singing of Troop Withdrawal) Their ranks were several miles long. When they passed through every street and alley, the people cheering on both sides of the road numbered in the tens of thousands. Regardless of gender or age, they all shouted slogans, raised their fists, and sang the temporarily composed song requesting the Soviet Union to withdraw its troops: After eight years of resistance, victory is finally achieved, recovering the nine provinces of the Northeast. The people must strive for it. The Soviet Union must withdraw quickly, and must abide by the Sino-Soviet Treaty, to maintain the territorial integrity of the Republic of China, and maintain the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the motherland. The Soviet Union withdraws, the Soviet Union withdraws, keep your promises, keep your promises; Return our nine provinces of the Northeast, return our nine provinces of the Northeast, let's strive together, let's strive together. The large ranks arrived at the gate of the Provincial Government at about 1:00 PM. They stated the motive and purpose of the parade and dispersed in good order. This extraordinary parade shook the people of the entire Jin City awake. The quiet Jin City appeared to be active.</p>
<p>(Sweet Rain Has Not Fallen) Since the beginning of spring, the weather has been clear and mild. In the past two months, sweet rain has not fallen, resulting in high rice prices, but they are still not as high as the price of rapeseed oil, which rises several times a day. In September of last year, 200 yuan could buy one catty of rapeseed oil, but now, it has skyrocketed geometrically. It costs more than 1,000 yuan per catty, and at one point it even rose to 1,400 yuan. The price of rice has also risen from 1,700 yuan per double to 3,400 yuan. The prices of other goods can be imagined. Furthermore, in Anle Temple and Zhengyu Garden, you can see tens of thousands of people moving, and 200 or 300 long snake-like chartered cars lined up in front of the gate. Their owners can jump to become millionaires in a few short hours, or they can become penniless paupers owing millions in debt. That market, that occasion, only smells of human flesh, only smells of the stench of touching paper money. That occasion has a lot of laughter, but even more crying. The time from 8:00 AM to 12:00 PM is the moment when people are most crowded. People are wriggling, deceiving, and panicking, living in a thousand changes in an instant. That is a market for various transactions, no, it's a cannibalistic fight of fright! Day after day, month after month, making the quiet Jin City become dynamic.</p>
<p>(A Pit for Spending Gold) Near the Erxian An Temple and Qingyang Palace in Xinximen, the annual flower fair there—actually an industrial fair—moves all of Sichuan. From southern Sichuan, eastern Sichuan, western Sichuan, and northern Sichuan, large and small handicrafts and various businesses have gathered. They rent land and sell their agricultural products and handicrafts. Like Nanjing's Fuzi Temple, Suzhou's Guanqian Street, Beijing's Tianqiao, and Shanghai's Town God Temple, it is a place where people watch people and people squeeze people. It is said that it was originally established as a mutual aid and observation gathering for various industries, but extended to today, it is a pit for spending gold. Tens of thousands of pilgrims and tens of thousands of men, women, and children flock from all directions. Dozens of extra carriages have been added at the entrance of Citang Street to welcome and serve people. It is still only the initial stage recently, and there is already a situation of extreme overcrowding. The people of Chengdu also love to join in the fun. During this month-long flower fair, if you don't go to the fair once, you will surely be seen as a hopeless outdated person. Thus, the quiet Jin City will quickly become dynamic once again.</p>
<h3>My Country's Meteorological Undertakings Enter a Stage of Significant Progress</h3>
<p>— Our Newspaper Chongqing Airmail News, Sent by Zhiwei</p>
<p>Since the victory, many institutions that were created due to the needs of the war have been successively abolished. At the same time, there are also several construction institutions that are busy planning the development of their business in order to participate in this great nation-building work. The Central Meteorological Bureau is an institution established during the War of Resistance. The temporary bureau site is near Central University in Shapingba, Chongqing, at Gaojia Garden, but its tasks are becoming increasingly heavy due to the unfolding of the nation-building cause. The meteorological undertaking is a scientific undertaking that explores the conditions of the atmosphere and predicts future weather. Its purpose is similar to that of the geological undertaking in exploring underground treasures and the marine undertaking in exploring the water world. Due to the close relationship between weather and human life, the meteorological undertaking is not only related to military affairs, but also relied upon by national economy and people's livelihood construction, such as the abundance of agricultural products, the safety of sea and air transportation, and national health issues, none of which do not require predicting future weather changes.</p>
<p>However, to complete this objective, it is necessary to have centralized management and densely distributed weather stations, otherwise, all efforts will be in vain. The authorities of our government, in view of this, established the Central Meteorological Bureau in the autumn of the 30th year. However, during the War of Resistance, most of the weather stations in the country fell into the hands of the enemy, and transportation was blocked. The deployment of talents and the replenishment of equipment could not be properly handled.</p>
<p>At present, the most urgent work of the bureau is to adjust the weather stations across the country, unify standards, and centralize management. Those run by the enemy and puppets must be recovered. For example, the Shanghai Bund Signal Station has been received by the bureau and reorganized into the Shanghai Meteorological Observatory. In the future, the station can be responsible for supplying meteorological information along the coast. The meteorological undertaking in Taiwan has been taken over by Shi Yanhan, Director of the Fujian Provincial Meteorological Bureau, nearby, and is working as usual. In addition, meteorological institutions in North China and Northeast China are also being received by appointed personnel.</p>
<p>My country originally lacked meteorological talents. Meteorological technicians who have served in various places for many years and have made outstanding achievements are now heard that the bureau plans to register them for use in the near future, and will separately train them to instill new technologies. (February 28th)</p>

<h3>Carefully Planned by British Architects, Great London is About to be Realized</h3>
<p>[Report from our Translation Department] London is truly too small. London's population is equivalent to Columbia's. But its area is only one-fifth of Columbia's. One-sixth of the entire British population is crammed into London and its suburbs. It is not only the seat of government, but also the most important port in Britain, the hub of British industry and commerce, the largest commercial port in Britain, and a center of academia and culture. It is the heart of Britain, but its development has been so abnormal that it seems the body cannot bear this huge "heart."</p>
<p>London's Development Spans Two Thousand Years</p>
<p>When London was originally built, no one thought it would become the center of a modern nation as it is today. It is like an organism that has slowly grown over two thousand years to become what it is now. When the Romans came to Britain in 55 BC, it was originally just a scattered settlement of Celtic natives. The Romans built city walls and Roman-style cities here, giving it the name "Londinium." As Rome declined, the city flourished under Saxon rule, and the area outside the city gradually became lively. By the 16th century, it had become one of the leading commercial ports in Europe. In 1666, a great fire in the city destroyed countless buildings, but within a few years, it quickly revived, with all the buildings rebuilt in the old style, with narrow streets and small courtyards for each house.</p>
<p>A Map of London Resembles a Spider</p>
<p>At the same time, London was expanding rapidly. Queen Elizabeth and other monarchs repeatedly tried to stop the city's expansion, but to no avail. By the 18th and 19th centuries, London had spread to neighboring counties, swallowing up many small towns and villages, and its population increased dramatically, breaking world historical records. Londoners built houses as much as possible along railways and highways, and the map of London became somewhat like a spider.</p>
<p>Generally, people with knowledge felt that such abnormal expansion was inappropriate. They believed that the city had absorbed too much population. In a large place like America, a city as large as London would not necessarily be top-heavy, but Britain is much smaller than America, so this development quickly became a problem. Many excellent farmlands have been built upon. Britain is densely populated, and most of its food needs to be imported from abroad. Such a sacrifice of arable land is a great loss.</p>
<p>Curved Lanes Become Broad Streets</p>
<p>Indeed, London's present state cannot obscure the merits of its predecessors' planning and management. After the Great Fire of 1666, Sir Christopher Wren built fifty churches in the city, with towering spires, which were very beautiful. Many squares are also unmatched by the capitals of other countries. In the early 19th century, the engineer Nash designed many streets leading to Buckingham Palace, which are beautiful and antique, and are still a feature of London today. In recent decades, roads have been widened, and many dilapidated old houses have been demolished. The crowded and winding alleys of the past have now become broad streets, lined with neat and impressive mansions.</p>
<p>Warehouses Set Up Near the Palace, Smoke Blows into Residences</p>
<p>However, London is so important in Britain and has been prosperous for so many years that the value of land is naturally extremely high, and no one is willing to redesign it while ignoring the current situation. As a result, magnificent new thoroughfares are often followed by dilapidated and narrow alleys. Factories and coal smoke often blow into the vicinity of the palace. Although this phenomenon is quite common in European countries and even the United States, the British government, especially in recent years, has deeply felt that this mixed situation tarnishes the capital of the British Empire.</p>
<p>The Most Tragic Bombing is a Good Opportunity for Reconstruction</p>
<p>German bombs have completed the work that people wanted to do but were unwilling to do in peacetime. From the winter of 1940, for five years, London was constantly attacked by rockets, incendiary bombs, and other bombs, and many historical sites and streets became rubble. Apart from Tokyo and Berlin, London suffered the most severe bombing among the world's capitals. The British government immediately seized this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and decided to rebuild, replan, and re-determine the management of this metropolis for its future development.</p>
<p>A Brand New Posture Will Be Seen by the World</p>
<p>Professor Abercrombie formulated a plan in 1944 and wrote a special book, which was enthusiastically discussed by architects and engineering experts throughout Britain. According to this plan, there will be a central area called "the City of London"; a larger area around it called "Greater London"; and an area outside that called "Great London." It is expected that this two-thousand-year-old metropolis will appear before the people of the world in a brand new posture. (Translated by Ping)</p>
<h3>British Female Scientist Mrs. Needham Worked in a Low House on the Banks of the Jialing River</h3>
<p>Mrs. Needham, a scientist at Cambridge University, has completed her two-year service at the Sino-British Science Cooperation Office in China and has returned home. Her husband, Dr. Needham, is the director of the Sino-British Science Cooperation Office.</p>
<p>The Central Social Integration Center maintained by the British Council is located on a mountain ridge higher than the Jialing River in Chongqing. In this low house with white ants on the splints, countless new scientific models, magazines, reprints, boxes of instruments and chemicals, packages of special seeds and seedlings, and materials specially prepared for Chinese scientists who longed for information during the war in Britain and 鯿特地 passed through, as well as reports of Chinese scientists' research work and agricultural materials, arrived in Britain for scientists to use.</p>
<p>The work of the Sino-British Science Cooperation Office is not limited to Chongqing. All staff members traveled long distances by truck, visiting universities and scientific institutions in sparsely populated areas. The Needhams and two young Chinese scientists traveled thousands of kilometers north from Chongqing to the provinces of Shaanxi and Gansu. On the way, they encountered floods, which forced them to abandon the truck and wade to nearby hills.</p>
<p>In Baoji, Shaanxi, the Needhams and their party saw many things from scientific professors, for example: Henan University, founded in Kaifeng fifteen years ago, had suffered four times from Japanese invasion. The school taught in the Er Cun Zhuang Temple in Baoji, and professors and heavy duties lived in nearby farmhouses or valleys. The school had moved several boxes of instruments hundreds of miles by coolies, but lacked a laboratory opened by 摥. There were no scientific books in the library, because all scientific books had been destroyed by the Japanese. The clothes of teachers and students had also been sacrificed, so they all wore summer clothes in winter, and everyone hoped to get a brocade robe for relief. After the victory, news came that the school buildings had been severely damaged and transportation was difficult, and the school felt that it was difficult to restore the school. The enthusiasm during the war became a bubble.</p>
<p>On this trip, the Needhams traveled north to the Soil Conservation Institute of the Department of Agriculture and Forestry in Gansu Province, where the work was very good. In addition, they also visited the Forest Protection Institute and the Shaanxi Provincial 生 Experimental Institute, which began as early as 1932 to defend against the cholera epidemic that was prevalent at the time.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned places only represent a part of the visits of the Sino-British 篳門閨竇 Cooperation Office. The museum has done its best to adapt to the needs of Chinese scientists, although the amount of supply represents the heart of the people of Western Europe. Since the war has ended, the British Council will be able to more actively develop science and international relations with the close cooperation of Sino-British scientists. (3.15.

<h3>The Racecourse Should Be Made a Park</h3>
<p>Editor:</p>
<p>How should members of society use their leisure time? On the surface, it seems unimportant, but in fact, if leisure time is used improperly, not only will the social etiquette and customs decline, but the scope of life will also change accordingly. Therefore, appropriate public entertainment planning is an essential task for municipal planners.</p>
<p>It is heard that the racecourse in this city will hold another horse race in January of this year, and speculators are overjoyed. Horse racing is originally a kind of sport abroad, with prize horse racing, in order to promote the spirit of sports, but Shanghai is not the case. Not only can it not incorporate sports into horse racing, but it makes citizens increase their luck-seeking psychology and engage in gambling activities. The result will inevitably increase the opportunity for depravity, and the social situation will be chaotic and more complicated, which is harmful and useless.</p>
<p>The streets in Shanghai are narrow and the houses are crowded. There is a lack of land, which leads to turbid air. The parks in major cities in the world account for one-tenth of the total area of the city, but the area of land in this city is less than 4%. Now that the concession has been recovered, the construction has just begun, and the municipal authorities of this city are planning a modern municipal city lacking. If the land is acquired and opened to the public, then the center of this city can also have a relatively spacious place for citizens to visit and exercise, then the city appearance can be started from here, and can be gradually rectified. I deeply hope that the municipal authorities will study this. If it can be realized, it will indeed be a blessing for the citizens of this city. Zhang (Yongling, 3.15.)</p>
<p>Our country's eight-year war of resistance has exhausted its vitality, and all construction has been destroyed. At this time of waiting for everything to be rebuilt, the people should save money and food to assist local construction. Unexpectedly, since this spring, in the area of ​​western Zhejiang (especially Haining County), there is still a group of local ruffians who instigate unemployed people to launch a meeting. Not only does it cost money and labor, but it also tramples on spring flowers. It has already played out and violated the principles of the New National Movement. The county authorities, in addition to official articles and notices to prohibit it, do not see any other specific measures to stop it. The township offices do not ask or hear about it, and some even lose their assistance and collude with each other! Now some temples have already posted "strips of meeting translation", which shows that there is a "trend that arrows are on the string and cannot be fired". I think there are many similar situations in various places, confusing the attention of the authorities, and strictly ordering the provincial and county governments to take practical and effective measures!

<h3>Remembering the Poet Yang Yunshi</h3>
<p>— Tang Liyan</p>
<p>Alas, the poet Mr. Yang Yunshi has passed away. It is said that when Ziqi died, Boya never played the zither again for the rest of his life. Moreover, Mr. Yang wrote about the pain of his family and country with a pen like an oak tree, with deep and desolate feelings, directly approaching the High Tang Dynasty. He combined the bones of Du Fu and the appearance of Li Bai, and even Mei Cun and Shou Zhai should bow their hands to him. There has been no such work in the past three hundred years. Literature is about to be lost, and philosophy is withering. Therefore, the passing of Mr. Yang is not only a feeling of losing a zither, is it?</p>
<p>I met Mr. Yang at the beginning of 1938. At that time, Hangkou had just fallen, and famous scholars gathered in Xianghai. I had long admired Mr. Yang, and through the introduction of Mr. Shao Quanshi, I was able to meet him at Kowloon Ying Wangzi Road. We talked all day long and never got tired of it. Seeing his handsome and refined appearance, I imagined Zhang Xu in his youth, which made people admire him very much. Since then, we have visited each other from time to time. We talked about everything in the world and discussed poetry and literature until midnight. One day, Mr. Yang visited, and Xie Wu Liang happened to be there. I introduced them to each other, and they both felt like they had met late. So we went to the Yangjing Restaurant together, and the Hu Ji pressed wine, filling the store with fragrance. Although there was no poem about the Yellow River rising far away, the heroic feelings and uninhibited interest were no less than when painting on the wall of the Qiting.</p>
<p>My poetry and lyrics have always been without a teacher. When I was teaching at Xiamen University in 1926 and 1927, I met Mr. Chen Shiyi. I asked to study under him as a disciple, and Mr. Yang smiled and said, "The trouble with people is that they like to be teachers," so he wrote after correcting my clumsy manuscript:</p>
<p>"With the style of Jian Zhai, write the beautiful thoughts of Zhong Ze. The lyrics are like Qin Liu, and they are often outstanding. Looking at the ancient and modern poems together, they are also the descendants of Wen Wei, Du Fan Chuan."</p>
<p>Since then, I dared to engage in this learning. And poverty also depends on running around for food and clothing, or working hard on the desk, or the podium has many accidents. After drinking and before the dignity, I occasionally do it. When I made friends with Mr. Yun Shi, Mr. Yang asked for my recent works, and I recorded dozens of them to advance. Mr. Yang brought it back with him and returned it on a different day. Ying wrote a note saying:</p>
<p>"There is a clear thought, and his dashing talent is expressed with a brilliant pen. Therefore, he can digest the ancient and transform it, and the paper makes a sound. It is a talented person's pen, and it is a passionate person's words. When sitting with famous flowers and beautiful women to read it, you know the wisdom of the lyricist. I admire Yuanliang."</p>
<p>Mr. Yang especially praised my line "Under the air raid in Hankou, watching the Qin Huai singing and dancing with swords and singing," saying that it could compete with Mei Cun. Both gentlemen spared no effort to praise and encourage the younger generation, which is commendable. Now they have both passed away, and my learning has not made any progress. Every time I think about it, I cannot help but feel ashamed.</p>
<p>Mr. Yang's poetry is like Mei Cun's, but his painting is covered by his poetic name, which is also like Mei Cun's. One day, I asked Mr. Yang for a poem on the head of a fan. Mr. Yang drew a plum blossom, with old branches stretching horizontally and sparse branches scattered, and a vigorous style, which was also very charming. The meaning of Jin Dongxin is not more than that. And he wrote two seven-character quatrains:</p>
<p>"Write the plum blossoms and give them to you. The dreams of sorrow in Jiangnan are chaotic. Luofu is close, and Gushan is far away. The soul of poetry is everywhere in the chaotic waters and clouds.</p>
<p>The monkeys and cranes in the old mountain hate to be hazy. The dreams of Jianghu are no longer everywhere. The red calyx also knows how to endure the wind and snow, and endure death for people to wait for the return of spring."</p>
<p>At that time, everyone present had no home to return to, and they were filled with emotion. I forced a smile and said, "The people by the stove are like jade, and their wrists are condensed with frost and snow. Don't return to your hometown when you are not old, and you must break your heart when you return to your hometown." And I went to the restaurant upstairs. Now the essence still exists, but the poet has passed away, and he cannot endure death for a moment to wait for the return of spring?</p>
<p>The mountains and rivers of Kowloon are beautiful, and the seawater of Song Wangtai is swallowed up and mourned. (Song Wangtai is the place where Emperor Zhao Bing was martyred in Yai Shan.) The Qingshan Temple is vast in the clouds, which are enough to evoke the feelings of the past, and the Thousand Buddha Mountain is even better. On good days in spring and autumn, we followed Mr. Yang's staff and visited everywhere. One day, we went to the Thousand Buddha Temple. The monks in the temple were still not vulgar, and they held up inkstones and asked for a poem. Shao Quanshi first completed a five-character quatrain, and I wrote a seven-character ancient poem:</p>
<p>"I came to worship Buddha on Qianfo Mountain, and Qianfo Mountain is in the mountains. Clouds and Xia are bright and dark or can be seen, and thousands of Dengs squat and climb. The ten thousand dharmas of Tathagata are unspeakable, and I am free with a smile of a flower. White clouds and flowing water are far away, and the sea is vast and bays repeat."</p>
<p>Mr. Yang smiled and said: "Cui Hao wrote a poem, and Li Bai put down his pen. Today, I should give you a head start." So he did not write it again. Mr. Yang was a famous family in Yu Shan, and his ancestors were officials. He entered Beiguan when he was young, and he was the only one after Zhang Nantong (Jizhi Shi) in Zhongnan Yuan. Therefore, he was appreciated by Li Hefei, the prime minister, and married his eldest granddaughter, Ms. Daoqing. Mrs. Li was virtuous and died early. She was good at writing small orders, and her works were attached to Mr. Yang's Changjiang Wanli Tower poetry and lyrics, which can be read to imagine her style. He remarried Ms. Xu Xiake (Xiake seems to be in contrast to Yun Shi, not stealing from the ancients), who was also intelligent and knowledgeable. Mr. Yang once said, "I chose a master for ten years and got Wu (referring to Wu Ziyu), and I chose a wife for three years and got you (referring to Ms. Xu). What more can I ask for in my life's happiness?" Knowing that his Guanfang's happiness is better than Zhang Chang's. Later, he died of illness in Fuzhou, and Mr. Yang was very sad and wrote a posthumous wife's record, saying that it can be compared with Mao Bijiang's Yingmei An's Memories and Shen Sanbai's Six Records of Floating Life, enough to make three.</p>
<p>Mr. Yang's thinking leans towards conservatism. He was a Langzhong in the Qing Dynasty when he was young (Ministry of Households and Postal Ministry). After entering the Republic of China, he gave up the idea of ​​making progress. Later, he was appreciated by General Wu Ziyu, and he also made it clear that he would only be a staff member and not an official. Therefore, when General Wu was prosperous, he whipped and wrote more than ten provinces, and all the generals and deputy generals were awarded Fangmian. However, Mr. Yang was alone and detached from the world, and he took nothing but his salary. After Yuezhou, the arrears of salary reached tens of thousands, but Mr. Yang was grateful for his knowledge and carried his sword to follow the expedition, opening the customs for thousands of miles. When Wu Gong was defeated and his troops scattered, Mr. Yang still did not leave. Even when he went to Xianghai, he was ordered by Wu Gong to take care of something. The world is declining and morality is falling, and people's hearts are not ancient. Mr. Yang can be considered a model. He can be entrusted with a six-foot orphan, and he can be entrusted with a hundred miles of life. Mr. Yang has it.</p>
<p>Since Mr. Yang was loyal to the Qing Dynasty, he hated Yuan Shikai very much and respected Kang Youwei very much. Kang also regarded him as a national scholar, and once said to Wu Ziyu, "Mr. Yunshi is loyal and bright, and has the demeanor of an ancient famous minister, but he was not born at the right time. It's a pity." At that time, there were clouds of strategists and rain of fierce generals in Wu Gong's curtain, such as Chief Counselor Mr. Zhang Taiyan, Chief of Staff Jiang Baili (Fang Zhen), Secretary-General Zhang Qiheng, Director of Military Affairs Zhang Fulai, Director of Foreign Affairs Zhang Zhitian, Director of Transportation Gao Enhong, etc., were all famous figures at the time. However, General Wu only treated Mr. Taiyan and Mr. Yunshi with respect. He also humbly adopted what they offered. People said that General Wu was arrogant and self-willed, but how could that be the case?</p>
<h3>The Spirit and Atmosphere of Landscape Painting and the Smoke and Clouds</h3>
<p>— Shi Chongzhi</p>
<p>When Xie He of the Southern Qi Dynasty critiqued the painters of his time, he noted that only Lu Tanwei and Wei Xie possessed all six elements of painting. Others like Cao Buxing, Zhang Mo, and Xun Xu occasionally had outstanding works that captured the essence in miniature. However, painters of the second, third, fourth, fifth, and sixth ranks could only achieve a semblance, possessing merely one or two aspects. This was during a time when landscape painting was not yet prevalent. The six elements were not exclusively for landscape paintings, and Xie He's critiques weren't limited to landscape painters either. However, after Xie He, Zong Bing, Emperor Yuan of Liang, Zhang Yanyuan of the Tang Dynasty, and Guo Ruoxu of the Song Dynasty, among others, fully developed the meaning of the six elements. They applied "qi yun sheng dong" (spirit consonance and life movement) to landscape painting and prioritized it when evaluating the quality of landscape paintings. They regarded planning the composition and accurately depicting forms as the method of creation; representing objects realistically and applying colors accordingly as the technique of expression; and considered the use of brushstrokes and bone structure as merely a means, not worthy of much discussion. Zong Bing said in his Preface to Landscape Painting:</p>
<p>"Responding to the meeting of the senses and understanding the spirit, the spirit transcends and grasps the principle." He determined that painting was entirely a matter of "spirit" and "principle." All painters, when creating, must purify their minds and regulate their qi, achieving a harmonious understanding. Only then can the imposing peaks and misty forests emerge. Only at this level can the spirit and atmosphere be expressed. Emperor Yuan of Liang spoke more concretely in his Landscape Painting and Pine and Rock Styles:</p>
<p>"The name of Heaven and Earth, the spirit of creation, establishes ingenious forms and depicts the landscapes' breadth. One must be lofty and free in thought, skillful in brushstrokes, and refined in ink." This indicates that painters should use techniques to depict nature, and at the same time, possess a noble character and secluded thoughts to achieve skillful brushstrokes and refined ink. Spirit and atmosphere are entrusted in the image of the painting. Zhang Yanyuan's opinions in his Six Principles of Painting also emphasized spirit and atmosphere, regarding formal likeness as not the most pressing matter:</p>
<p>"Ancient paintings disregarded formal likeness but valued inner strength, seeking their artistic quality beyond formal resemblance. Today's paintings may achieve formal likeness but lack spirit and atmosphere. Seeking artistic quality through spirit and atmosphere will naturally result in formal likeness." This explains that spirit and atmosphere are the prerequisites for painting. With spirit and atmosphere, the painting comes alive. Once alive, it achieves the goal of formal likeness. If one focuses solely on formal likeness and lacks cultivation of spirit and atmosphere, one may achieve a lifeless resemblance but lack living spirit and atmosphere. As for Guo Ruoxu's discussion of spirit and atmosphere, he called it "knowing from birth," not something learned:</p>
<p>"The Six Principles are a refined theory, unchanging for all time. However, the five principles below the use of bone structure and brushwork can be learned. As for spirit and atmosphere, it must be known from birth. It cannot be obtained through cleverness or diligence, but through silent understanding and spiritual convergence, unknowing and yet knowing." How exactly does one attain this "knowing from birth"? Compared to Emperor Yuan of Liang's "noble character and profound thought," it is even more abstract. In short, throughout the ages, discussions on landscape painting have consistently emphasized "spirit consonance and life movement." Landscape is the most magnificent phenomenon in nature. Benevolent people delight in mountains, wise people delight in water. Painters take the various scenes of wind, rain, haze, and sunshine in the mountains and rivers as subject matter. The change and concealment of smoke and clouds are even more important embellishments in landscape painting. Since Wang Qia's splash ink technique, Mi Yuanzhang expanded and transformed Dong Yuan's style of "clouds on the mountains" into the Mi School of cloud mountains, paying no attention to paper and brush tools. (Modern painters often utilize fine paper and brushes, some even turning raw paper into prepared paper, which is unnecessarily laborious.) He allowed nature to take its course, refraining from excessive dyeing and blurring. Zhang Yanyuan had a strict critique of painting clouds:</p>
<p>"Ancient people's depiction of clouds was not yet perfect. If they dipped silk in water and dotted it with light powder, they would say it was 'blowing clouds,' even if cleverly done, there would be no trace of brushwork. Yanyuan's idea is particularly good, but it cannot be called a method of learning. As for using splash ink in landscape painting, that is going too far. Splash ink has its own moments of inspiration, but blowing clouds is not worth imitating." He opposed the forced method of blowing clouds. If splash ink is successful, it is another type of ink play, but not the orthodox way of painting clouds. The cloud atmosphere in the mountains varies with the seasons. As Guo Xi said:</p>
<p>"Spring is harmonious, summer is lush, autumn is sparse, winter is dim. When painting, capture their grand essence, and do not be constrained by rigid forms, then the attitude of the clouds will be alive! The haze and mist in landscapes vary with the seasons. Spring mountains are faint and like a smile; summer mountains are verdant and like dripping; autumn mountains are clear and like makeup; winter mountains are bleak and like sleep. When painting, capture their general intent, and do not be constrained by detailed depictions, then the appearance of haze and mist will be correct." All these cloud atmospheres of spring, summer, autumn, and winter cannot be blown out of thin air, or achieved through splash ink alone. It all depends on the artist experiencing the mechanism of nature and depicting it with different brushstrokes and ink in different seasons, arranging different scenes in different seasons. This is what is meant by "responding to the meeting of the senses and understanding the spirit, the spirit transcends and grasps the principle." Therefore, smoke and clouds are not made by dyeing alone, and spirit and atmosphere is not just the meaning of smoke and clouds. The importance lies in the natural breath that emerges from the artist's heart. In addition, there is brush breath, ink breath, air, and vitality, constantly regenerating. Thus, the breath becomes stronger and the rhyme becomes thicker. It should not be confused with the smoke and cloud atmosphere created by ink and water dyeing.</p>
<p>The spirit and atmosphere of landscape painting is different from smoke and clouds, and ink and water dyeing should not be regarded as the standard of smoke and clouds. An overreliance on ink and water dyeing results in mountains always being in the clouds and trees always being in the smoke. At first glance, it seems that the paper is full of smoke and clouds, but upon closer inspection, it is bland and tasteless, frivolous and superficial, and can be called nothing more than a "Jianghu School!" Lin Qinnan once discussed the dyeing of smoke and clouds, expressing it thoroughly:</p>
<p>"The ancients said that in the empty spaces of the mountain corners, the brush enters nothingness, and when the tree shadows are faint, the ink becomes mist. These four sentences have already opened the school of 'Jianghu'. What makes the 'Jianghu' school eye-catching is that it likes to use ink and water to create a cloud-like atmosphere. For the trees, it uses wet brushes and adds flower blue. Regardless of sunny days, it also carries the intention of rain, seeming that mountains must be in the clouds and trees must be in the smoke, thinking that arriving at this atmosphere is to reach a realm of transformation. It is all the same, never leaving the single word 'thin'. But looking at the remaining works of the mountain woodcutters, although they emphasize overlapping peaks, they never use clouds to reflect the scene. One tree and one rock are clearly distinguishable and do not create the atmosphere of smoke and clouds. Because mountains have four seasons, they cannot be dyed with light smoke and dense clouds alone to create a strange structure." These are pearls of wisdom.</p>
<p>Spirit consonance and life movement are indeed the highest standards of painting. Landscape painting is the greatest representative art that depicts nature and entrusts the spirit. It occupies the most important position in painting. To achieve spirit consonance and life movement in landscape painting, one must devote oneself to the five elements below bone structure and brushwork in the Six Principles. At the same time, one must purify one's mind and regulate one's qi, cultivate secluded thoughts, and possess a noble character. The saying that "art can replace religion" also has a cyclical effect related to this purification of the mind and regulation of qi. Dong Qichang's "reading ten thousand volumes of books and traveling ten thousand miles" is nothing more than to rid the mind of all worldly affairs, and only when Qiu He can do that, can he write freely and transmit the spirit of landscape painting.</p>
<h3>Parting Thoughts</h3>
<p>— Su Dan</p>
<p>Like a gray migratory bird, flying south and then flying north, flying north and then flying south, forever! A lonely wandering traveler.</p>
<p>Having just stayed in this desolate old temple for two months, tomorrow I must shoulder my heavy baggage again, and an even heavier, heavier heart, full of parting sorrow. He is leaving, for that distant and endless journey!</p>
<p>Although separation is not the first time for me, there is always a little bit of parting sorrow; that much remains.</p>
<p>But what is it that makes me attached? I am attached to the innocent hearts of a group of children, without pretense; without lies, a little warmth of pure and sacred affection.</p>
<p>When Xiaoju and Xiaowei came here this afternoon, they were so sincere and eager to learn. Two pairs of round, eyes, full of the brilliance of life, looked at me and said affectionately:</p>
<p>"Teacher, are you leaving tomorrow?" Why don't you teach us anymore?"</p>
<p>What can I say to them? Even if I said it, would they understand? Would children understand that young people are running for hope? I could only force a smile:</p>
<p>"There will be a better teacher than me to teach you."</p>
<p>But they said, "Teacher, can't you not leave?"</p>
<p>Can I not leave? Even I can't say. I dare not look at their earnest eyes; I think, why should I abandon these children? What is it that I need to pursue by leaving? Is it that flower-like vision?</p>
<p>I grew gloomy, and I didn't know what to say to these children.</p>
<p>Life is urging me, and hope is flickering. Don't blame me for being selfish, but who can give up hope and not pursue it? People live to pursue hope, and pursue hope to live.</p>
<p>In the morning meeting, I told them, I said, "There will always be times of separation between people. We shouldn't always live in a small circle. We must have great ambitions. When you grow up in the future, you must also leave your parents… Leave them and go everywhere to find something that satisfies you. Don't feel sad about leaving home, because your own ambitions and hopes are important…"</p>
<p>Are these words said to them or to myself? I repeated them again. The children's heads drooped down, and silence occupied us.</p>
<p>My own ambitions and hopes are important. I have to fail the children's kind enthusiasm.</p>
<p>The sky darkened, and they said goodbye to me in tears, so reluctantly. Their hands were tightly held by me. How touched I was!</p>
<p>"Don't be sad, I'll come to see you again in the future. Listen to the teacher and go home! Study hard, knowledge is the most precious thing in the world."</p>
<p>They left, but my heart gradually grew heavy. Although I received great sincere affection and warmth, I also have infinite sorrow and longing!</p>
<p>Tomorrow, I will step on the winding road again, walking alone. I will be a wandering traveler again!</p>
<p>Desolate parting! That distant and endless journey.</p>
<h3>Autumns Under the Pen</h3>
<p>— Xie Dongping</p>
<h3>"Two Lines"</h3>
<p>— Xie Dongping</p>
<p>Geometry approximately defines, "Two parallel lines, can never be together." But, actually two lines with limitless development, will inevitably meet together, because the Earth is an ellipse and not a square.</p>
<p>(I) However, the two lines I want to speak of here are not two parallel lines, but a vertical line and a horizontal line that make up a right angle. The vertical line is the line from top to bottom, which symbolizes autocracy and dictatorship. The horizontal line is the line from left to right or from right to left, which symbolizes democracy.</p>
<p>We can say very affirmatively that the development of history must develop into one or two right angles. To its ultimate end, even the vertical line on the horizontal line will be eliminated, leaving only an infinitely long horizontal line. This horizontal line is made up of countless independent, free, and equal individuals working together. Each independent individual is a certain "point" within this line. In such a society, the rights and obligations of any individual are the same, equal to any point on a parallel line, where their position within that line is exactly the same.</p>
<p>(II) The development of Chinese history is now gradually developing into one or two right angles, but it may also develop into three or four right angles. There is no doubt that the horizontal line is increasing without limit. At the same time, there is no doubt that the vertical line is also struggling hard, both hindering the formation and growth of the horizontal line and seeking to prolong its own life. If a fragile horizontal line is pierced straight through by a fierce vertical line, then the resulting right angle will inevitably be four.</p>
<p>Look, the call for democracy is loud, but the style of doing everything from the top down has not changed. Even the most democratic saying, that "everything should always be from the bottom up," the "top" and "bottom" concepts in this "bottom up" approach are really not truly democratic concepts. This is because in a truly democratic society, there is no distinction between top and bottom. Everyone's status is that of the people, and everyone has the right to be president. To have a fixed "top" and a fixed "bottom," how can that be called democracy?</p>
<p>At present, in China, a historical vertical line and a horizontal line with historical significance are about to meet, or perhaps have already met. We hope that after these two lines meet, and after a period of "neutralization," only one infinitely long horizontal line will remain. Don't let everyone pull it long and form four right angles.</p>
<h3>Staying Together as a Couple (21)</h3>
<p>— Zhao Qingge</p>
<p>However, Second Madam Weng grabbed Shi Yulou. She still hadn't understood everything he was thinking in his heart at this moment. She always felt that Shi Yulou was crazy about her. Now that Shi Yulou wanted to leave, it was even more like he was coaxing her. She simply thought she had become Yang Yanhui in "Fourth Son Visits His Mother," and Shi Yulou was Princess Iron Mirror. They seemed to be performing a scene from "Sitting in the Palace."</p>
<p>"Don't worry, my darling! Even if you leave Jingzhou, you can't leave me, so you don't have to think about these things," Second Madam Weng said, patting Shi Yulou's shoulder.</p>
<p>"That's strange, I'm leaving you right away!" Shi Yulou angrily finally said a loud sentence, and then he wanted to push away Second Madam Weng.</p>
<p>"But, I still say the same thing: 'I don't care'!" Second Madam Weng repeated the same words again, and asked him, "Do you understand? Do you understand why I wouldn't care?" Second Madam Weng said, still holding Shi Yulou tightly.</p>
<p>"Why? Because there are so many actors, if I leave today, there will be even better actors coming tomorrow to make you happy. Anyway, you, Second Madam Weng, have plenty of money. You can support this one and then support that one." Shi Yulou said these words in one breath. He felt that it was more difficult than when he usually sang.</p>
<p>Second Madam Weng cried!</p>
<p>"Oh, no wonder you're so angry, so that's what you thought! Then you've wronged my good intentions too much, you silly!"</p>
<p>Hearing Second Madam Weng say this, Shi Yulou was stunned! He tried hard to sort out his already disordered thoughts, and he realized that Second Madam Weng still didn't think what he had originally suspected. But he was still half-believing and half-doubting, saying:</p>
<p>"I don't understand what you mean!"</p>
<p>"Really?" Second Madam Weng asked him with a hint of playfulness.</p>
<p>"Yeah!" Shi Yulou responded. He began to feel bothered, and he seemed unwilling to listen anymore.</p>
<p>"Then I'll tell you, what I mean is: you won't leave me, because wherever you go, I will go with you! Even to the ends of the earth." Second Madam Weng enunciated each word one by one.</p>
<p>Shi Yulou felt even more oppressed. He regretfully wondered if he should have let Second Madam Weng say her true thoughts. He had been afraid that she would have such thoughts, so he had brought up the issue. The meaning of his bringing up the issue was to persuade Second Madam Weng to give up such thoughts, but now the effect was the opposite, seemingly strengthening Second Madam Weng's determination even more. Therefore, Shi Yulou was somewhat flustered! He pondered for a while, and finally said resolutely:</p>
<p>"You can't have this kind of thought. You have a home; you have a husband; you have children; you are a madam from an official's family, but I am just an actor."</p>
<p>Before Shi Yulou could finish speaking, Second Madam Weng interrupted and said:</p>
<p>"Please don't speak anymore! The home was built by me, and it should be me who dissolves it; the husband is as good as dead; the children, I can have them fostered out; all of this has nothing to leave behind, and nothing to worry about. You say you are an actor, I tell you I was a Qing opera singer; although later I became the concubine of an official, I am not any more noble than you. So, we are both wanderers on the road! Only when we are together can our hearts communicate."</p>
<p>Second Madam Weng had now become assertive and willful! This was partly due to the influence of Madam Mo, and partly brought out in front of Shi Yulou. Her words were strong and decisive, severely threatening Shi Yulou's fragile soul. At the same time, she was quite surprised that she was such an open-minded and responsible person.</p>
<p>"Why aren't you talking anymore?" Second Madam Weng anxiously pressed Shi Yulou. Hoping that Shi Yulou could give her an affirmative answer.</p>
<p>"I, I have nothing to say. My heart is very chaotic!"</p>
<p>Shi Yulou's heart was indeed very chaotic at this moment! He didn't know what to say, and he couldn't make up his mind about what to do. He could only remain silent. But his silence was mistaken by Second Madam Weng as an agreement! Therefore, she no longer delved deeper, and she was confident that she had already captured Shi Yulou. She began to plan for a future dream.</p>
