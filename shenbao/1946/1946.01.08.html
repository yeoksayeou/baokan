<h3>國軍陸續飛長春首批保安隊全師三週運畢　担任警戒及協助接收工作</h3>
<p>〔本報北平六日電〕五日開始由平空運長春之部隊，經探悉為由偽滿軍隊反正再編之東北保安第二總隊，首批官兵二一七名，由副總隊長吳耀宗率領，分乘運輸機十架飛長，今日續有官安兵二五〇名起飛，預計該部須三週始可運畢，總隊長劉德溥定下週飛往。據悉：該部到達後，除一部担任長春警戒外，其餘將配屬各省府，協助接收工作。今日劉總隊長語本報記者：該部素質極佳，大學畢業者佔百分之五，中學畢業者百分之四十，高小畢業者百分之五十。槍械配備，亦甚優良。數年以來，該部即與中央有密切聯繫，日本投降後，首先由駐地榛子鎭開入開灤礦區，加速工礦生產。九月廿六日奉命改編爲現在番號，全歐編制，略等於師。有一騎兵團，已隨杜聿明將軍進入熱河，其餘三步兵團，陸續空運前往。該部於日本投降前，駐紮灤縣，此次國恥旣雪，又得返歸故鄕，全體官兵，莫不欣喜若在。劉總隊長瀋陽人，東北講武堂十期畢業。</p>

<h3>熱河接防極順利南北兩路推進中</h3>
<p>〔中央社錦州七日電〕熱河接防，極爲順利。北路國軍，已自義縣·阜新等地，進至建平附近。南路國軍，亦於本日進至凌源附近。兩地防務，一二日內，即可接收竣事。</p>
<p>〔合衆社熱河方面隨軍記者六日電〕杜聿明將軍所部，在熱河省內，未發一槍，自共軍手中接連奪還煤礦中心地北票，曁鐵路公路重鎭朝陽等兩城。於是在過去四十八小時之內，已完全佔有所謂「東北之薩爾區」矣。北票錦縣間火車，已恢復行駛。據報告：熱河省政府儘速遷往朝陽。北票在熱河省邊境以內廿哩，沿錦縣朝陽鐵路處。朝陽在北票之西南，離熱遼邊境廿二哩。國軍於上週初收復阜新後，即將該兩城相繼佔領。該處居民有十三萬人，戰時由日軍擴大成爲東北最大之煤斤生產中心地，年產量幾達五百萬噸左右。北票一地，在日軍佔領時期，年產煤一百噸以上。阜新與北票，適在熱河省長七十五哩煤床地帶之兩端。杜部第十三軍自東面向省城承德緊壓，第九士二軍自西方北平地區推進，故承德已兩側受壓迫。杜將軍與熱河省主席劉多荃，星期五曾赴阜新視察，是日國軍開進北票城。星期六，國軍收復錦縣東北六十哩之朝陽。一月前蘇軍撤退後，熱河全省即由共軍深塹固守，在杜聿明軍經由阜新深入熟河南部之最後一分鐘時，始被迫後撤。在阜新時，由譯員之傳達，記者曾與當地村民談天，藉知共軍於國軍到達前半小時，始行退出。余（記者自稱）爲年來進入熱河之第一個美國通訊記者，曾隨同杜聿明將軍視察阜新北面之前綫部隊。</p>
<p>零下十五度士兵冒寒戍守</p>
<p>在華氏寒暑表零下十五度之溫度下，親見士兵圍坐牆後砲口處，顯有取暖之意，天氣之嚴寒，雖手帶皮手套，身穿冬季制服，似仍無濟於事。彼等手抱步槍，兩足跥踏不已，鼻中流涕，除以袖指拭外，別無他法。余隨搭杜將軍專車前往阜新，車上有衛隊數百名以裝甲火車前導。吉普車卡車等引擎，在全程中始終未曾停止，以防凍結。火車車頭與車廂中充滿水汀熱氣，余等自窗上外望，幾致無物可見。官兵不斷在車中飲茶取煖，途中車經臨時架搭之橋樑二處，兩旁原來之橋樑，業被共軍炸斷。</p>
<p>東北薩爾區僅兩穴堪使用</p>
<p>與杜將軍同行前往阜新北票者，尚有煤礦專家數人。視察收復後之所謂東北薩爾區阜新煤礦時，發見八處礦穴中，祇有兩穴尚堪使用。該兩穴屬於就地下掘式。其餘六穴深入地下，估計其修復時間，約需一年，始得恢復生產。過去數日間，根據華工及日籍管理之紀錄，中央煤礦專家曾作一詳細研究。彼等宣稱：重大機件，已被蘇方拆走，較小設備機件，亦均被共軍卸去。六穴中帮浦悉遭拆移，穴內全部水淹。余見其餘兩穴之礦工在零度下努力工作，每日可產煤五百噸；但日人盤踞期問，日可產煤一萬四千噸。據悉：共軍佔領之一月期間，每日共產煤三百噸。蘇軍佔據之兩個月期間，礦工皆懼而遠遁，生產完全停頓，同時蘇軍對此亦並不覺興趣，蘇軍所欲者，祇消拆移重機件足矣。</p>
<h3>廣州三漢奸將分別公審</h3>

<h3>長春市民慰勞國軍　設營組已進入瀋陽行政人員分兩路兼程出關</h3>
<p>〔中央社長春六日電〕空運東北保安隊抵此消息，已轟傳全市，各界分送慰勞品，並籌開慰勞大會，各項慰勞品有在一二月前即已辦妥者。又守衛行營各機關之蘇聯衛兵，本日多已撤去，而易以我初到之保安隊。</p>
<p>〔又電〕東北保安部隊，今午續有官兵一部，由平飛抵此間。彼等分乘十機，另有二機載來嫩江省主席彭濟羣，委員梁中權等，連同吉林·遼北·松江三省一部份接收人員，共三十八人。</p>
<p>〔中央社瀋陽六日電〕東北保安司令長官部設營組，原定昨晚由新民進入瀋陽，因交通關係，今晨九時始乘汽車抵此。記者同來，常車駛進市區時，沿途民衆對彭璧生將軍報以熱烈之歡呼，而對同來之警戒部隊，歡呼尤爲在熱。警戒兵之服裝及其一舉一動，均深引人注意。市長董文琦，及蘇軍城防副司令阿樂興，均在車站歡迎。</p>
<p>〔中央社北平七日電〕由平空運東北之部隊，由五日開始，連日天氣良好，進行至爲順利。束北各省府官員，及接收人員，連日亦大批空運出關。除松江·嫩江兩省主席，及重要人員前昨兩日已空運赴長春外，吉林省主席鄭道儒，現臥病不克起程，暫由省委王寗華暫代主席，七日晨率秘書長毛托卿等廿人，由平飛長春。接收經濟交通電信郵政等部門人員，正候機空運，日內可成行。在平東北行政人員，分空陸兩路，兼程出關，需時十日，可全部運竣。東北行營及各省首要人員，連日澈夜工作，計劃接收事宜。</p>

<p>社論</p>
<h3>我國海軍的重建</h3>
<p>日前報載消息，謂海軍總司令部奉令撤消，軍政部已派海軍處處長來滬接管，一面又載海軍總司令陳紹寬上將業已辭職。現值建國大業積極推進之候，而建國首要，端在建軍，是項國防軍事上之調整，實爲一僥有意義之措施。</p>
<p>首先我們要提出的是：在我們建軍的努力中，不可忽略了海軍的重要。中國雖是一個大陸的國家，然而我們有綿長的海岸綫，有台灣海南諸島，爲太平洋西岸惟一大國。爲保衛我們的海岸，爲保衛台灣海南，在我們建軍的努力上，我們要同時重視海軍。因爲我們從前沒有充分的海軍，所以抵抗不了倭寇的路海侵略。在我們的建國大業中，我們應該積極建設海軍。但在重建我國的海軍中，存在有若干重要的問題。第一，建軍的組織問題；第二，海軍政策的問題。在這以外，還有環繞着建軍的許多問題，如建軍之工業的及技術的問題，人才或人員的問題等等。但工業及人員問題，若與組織及政策問題相較，究爲次要。</p>
<p>有人要說這巳是原子能的時代，似可不必重建海軍，這未免有些錯誤。海軍在國防上具有消極與積極的雙重意義。就消極方面言，海軍足以阻止侵略。納粹德國的未能越英吉利海峽入侵英國，應歸功於英國的海軍。制海權的掌握，在國防的觀點上是極重要的。就積極方面言，最好的抵抗乃是攻勢，無海軍不能取攻勢。日寇的擊潰，主要是由於美國的海軍。若無尼米茲海軍元帥統率的海軍，何能佔硫磺島，取琉球？在諾曼第的登陸戰上，亦依賴盟方海軍的優勢。在擊潰軸心的戰事上，海軍實是一個極重要的因素。第二次世界大戰中，重新證明了海軍的重要性。在我國建軍的努力上，因此不能忽略海軍。</p>
<p>但在建軍的努力上，我們同時需要堅强的組織。海陸軍的雙重組織系統，已不合目今國防上的運用。這一種雙重組織實有改組的必要。美國原有獨立之海軍部，有識之士，爲應付未來局勢，早於第一次世界大戰後主張廢止，合海陸兩軍而構成一個以國防爲中心的整個作戰部或軍部。這個計劃可惜遭到反對未能實現。根據第二次世界大戰的經騐，美國大總統杜魯門最近又向國會提出議案，主張併海陸兩軍部而成爲一國防軍部。此案之被提出，實由於第二次世界大戰中慘痛之經騐，深得一般之推許。我國致力於海軍之建設逾五十年，但迄無成就。此中雖原因並不單純，而海軍之自成一系統，實在亦是一種障碍。今當我國積極建軍之會，軍事組織之調整，實爲當務之急，我們以爲軍政部之設海軍處，爲統一軍櫬之必要條件，揆諸最近國際趨勢，不失爲一種明智的步驟。不過海陸兩軍的任務究有不同，在軍權統一之下，允宜各有專責，分司其事。若以陸軍官佐來担當海軍的職司將是不能勝任的。我們所要努力的是在軍權統一之下造成我國海軍的新傳統，而不是造成海軍的陸軍化。</p>
<p>此外，軍權統一是指海陸空三軍而言。在美國，空軍是依附在陸軍的系統內的，惟英國有獨立的空軍。美國杜魯門總統的提案，是合海陸空三軍而成一整個的軍部，下分海陸空軍三處。此一計劃，實足爲我們建軍的借鏡。我國的空軍還在長成的階段，建設空軍，尤須與海陸建軍統盤籌劃·軍政部顧名思義以整個國家的武裝軍隊爲對象，我們贊成海軍劃歸軍政部節制的這一種措施，我們更希望中國的空軍也不必自成一系統，在軍權統一的號召下，亦應改隸軍政部調度。必如此，我國建軍纔有個健全的組織基礎。</p>
<p>至於政策方面，就海軍言，我們需要怎樣一個海軍，也值得研究。建設海軍需要工業基礎，不能立刻可以成就。日本海軍在第一次世界大戰中還是以外國的造艦爲主；這距它的積極建設海軍已三十餘年，可知海軍建設的不易。我國重建海軍應以衛國爲主要對象，它應是防禦性的而次不是侵略性的。故我國重建海軍的重心，不是在主力艦，而是在巡洋艦，航空母艦，驅逐艦乃至潛水艇。我國海軍的任務，不是在控制遠洋，而是在保衛近海。在太平洋彼岸的我國盟邦，已負有使太平洋永遠太平的任務，我國海軍的任務，就在太平洋西岸協助這個任務。爲履行這個任務，我們至少的需一百萬噸的艦艇，我們更需要大量的海軍兵員。中國的海軍建設，還沒有充分開始，我們要爲中國的海軍造下一個優良的傳統。因軍事機構的調整，我們希望中國的新海軍能够切切實實地重新建設起來。</p>

<h3>幣原仍有戀棧意圖　日內閣困難重重　派遣外相吉田普謁麥帥請示　日本總達日期將聽麥帥決定</h3>
<p>〔本報東京七日電〕日本政原刻正陷於杌隉不安困境中。幣局內閣之命運，大概一二日內即可決定。昨日內閣討論時，對於該閣是否總辭職問題，已交幣原一手辦理。今日本報記者至首相官邸門前，見政府人員出入其間，至爲忙碌，倉皇之態，露於形色。幣原因患惑冒，仍未起床，但今日在病中與各方接觸，廉續商談如何執行麥帥所頒之訓令。一般認爲幣原內閣有於一二日內倒台之可能，但幣原本人顯然仍有戀棧之意，據悉昨日渠曾通知諸閣員照常供職。社會民主黨今日公開抨擊幣原內閣，要求政府全體辭職，惟一般與論及政黨，至今未作露骨表示。同時幣原已命外相吉田晋議麥帥，請示關於內閣進退問題，並希望麥帥能顧及諸閣員之困難，而使內閣仍能立足。截至今日下午止，吉田尚未往謁麥帥。各方僉認日閣局部改組或總辭之實際行動，當在吉田音謁麥帥之後出之。至於今後日本整個政局自將受麥帥決策之影　，發生劇烈改革。政界及議會方面今日均認內閣危機之趨尖銳化，而貴衆兩院議員政黨人物以及地方人員之侵略份子，今後亦將在被肅淸之列，蓋麥帥發佈此令之目的，端在導使日本政治入於民主化之康莊大道。又據可靠方面聲稱：綜觀目前幣原之意圖，顯欲剔除內閣中被檢舉之侵略份子閣員，然後依照指令，實行政治及經濟改革，以渡過目前之難關。惟結局如何，則全視麥帥之決定。</p>
<p>〔聯合社東京七日電〕協同通訊社今日猜測：日本總選舉，約在二月中旬舉行。據統帥部方面稱：其正式日期，一俟麥帥指令廓淸日本侵略分子，保障人民自由投票後，即可由統帥部決定宣布。日內閣原定於一月間舉行普選，後奉統帥部訓令展期，惟內閣仍亟望早日選舉，俾向改選後召集之特別議會提出預算書及其他重要事件。</p>
<p>〔聯合社東京七日電〕麥帥最近指令肅清日本侵略份子，今日共產黨步其後塵，要求消滅日本婦女戰爭犯。據該黨婦女部長眞木公開宣稱：共產黨已準備一婦女戰爭犯名單，現正在進行編製第二批名單，內中包括女敎育家，女著作家，大政翼贊會女子組職員及受政府支持之日本婦女協會職員等，此外並有一工廠女工頭對女工嚴厲管制，有不服從者，輒行處罰。</p>

<p>〔路透社孟買七日電〕大會黨領袖尼赫魯，今日於信地省蘇柯爾地方之選舉會中演說稱，余希望印度·緬甸·馬來亞·錫蘭·伊朋及阿富汗，能組成聯邦，回印分治印度之計劃，足以造成永久之奴隸生活，即使英政府及回敎同盟贊成回印分治，然以辛度族及錫克族之反對，決不能成爲事實。英人於退出印度後，印度之政體開題，即可獲得解決，尼赫魯復謂，回印分治計劃與時代精神相違背。</p>
<p>〔中央社新德里六日專電〕英議會代表團本日下午抵新德里後，即舉行第一次記者招待會，重申該團係來印作縝密研究者，並將詢問有關印度問題之一切事項。代表團團長李孟斯敎授稱，吾等非爲有所敎誨而來者，亦非政府之代表，吾人且未受命作任何報告，純爲自由之代表。向以同情印度而最受印人愛戴之議員索倫生稱，「吾人係為學習而來，故余等必須掬誠奉告，吾人有發表言論之絕對自由。」李查斯表示，該團之計劃猶未決定，刻傳印回敎同盟主席眞納將爲印度領袖中會見代表團之第一人，渠刻在新德里。</p>

<h3>談海源閣藏書</h3>
<p>— 黄河淸</p>
<p>昨閱各報中央社天津電，稱聊城理源閣載書現存津，宋院長頃在津決定由政府收購，交北平圖書館教藏云云。查山東聊城，只有海源閣，並無理源閣，報載理源開，當係海源閣之誤。茲特提出更正，並略爲介紹如次：</p>
<p>海源閣係淸代楊以增　肅之閣，爲南北四大藏書家之一。宋元舊本達四百六十餘部，與常熟瞿氏鐵琴銅劍樓號「南瞿北楊」。該閣藏書雖屢遭兵　，多有散失，但精　名刊仍移，久爲日本垂涎，思以重價拥載而去。當時山東省政府得此消息，曾令山東省立圖書館館長王獻唐氏交涉由政府收購，以索價過昂，卒無成議，而日本之收買亦遭政府阻止。惟少數珍帙，仍難免暗中東渡，其書價之貴，在當時實可咋舌，據筆者所知，當時宋本離　售至七千元，宋本柳宗元集售一萬元云。又筆者於月前聞該閣在津存書，由國立北平圖書館館長袁同禮氏商洽收買，書價計二千萬元，業經敎育部朱部長批准。今中央社又有電稱宋院長決定收買，則事在必行矣。此等極可寶貴之先代典籍，得國家專責保藏，自後當不復有散佚之虞，洵可喜也。</p>

<h3>陳國廉表示　法艦潛運戰犯案　絕非地方事件　法總領與艦長應負刑事責任</h3>
<p>「白爾丁」號事件絕不能視爲地方事件，我方現正在重慶與法方進行交涉中，外交部並已向法駐華使館提出嚴重抗議，要求立即履行我方所提出之各項條件，並保證不再發生類似事件</p>
<p>陳國廉氏嚴予指斥</p>
<p>外交部駐滬辦事處處長陳國廉昨於接見記者時對法總領費禮浩指該案爲地方事件一點，加以駁覆稱：此案絕不能視爲地方事件，而爲我國收回治外法權後所發生之第一件大事，法方此次遠法舉動，在主權上講爲侵佔我主權之行動，在法律上講，法總領與「白爾丁」號艦長均應負刑事上的責任，因治外法權收回後在中國領土內，在上海除警備總司令部警察局憲兵司令部及司法機關可捕人外，任何人無逮捕人犯之權，故法方在滬逮捕人犯，即已觸犯刑章，蓋法方企圖利用上海人民數十年來對外人之傳統觀念及其錯覺心理，以造成旣成事實，此舉雖不影響及人民之生活，但我國家地位所受之影響實非淺鮮，而主權之喪失，亦即由此而起。故外交部對此案，絕不以普通地方事件視之也。試舉一例，萬一將來有一外國軍艦，將避居該國領事館之我國僞組織之高級人員載去，其嚴重性將復如何。總而言之，勝利後之我國國民，固應養成一種新的風氣，而外國使節對於我國亦應有一種新的認識。我國爲維護主權之完整，法律之尊嚴，自不得不採取堅決而適當之步驟也。</p>
<p>法領所稱絕無理由</p>
<p>記者又查得關於法總領事所稱並未獲得法駐華大使關於封閉領事法庭之通知，及在中法新約未簽字生效前法總領事仍握有領事裁判　兩點，根據外交部前所公佈之令文，更絕不能成立，蓋我外交部早於三十二年五月十九日照會法國駐華暫行代辦使事彭固爾鄭車聲明，「所有法國依照中法間不平等條約所取得之租界，北平使館界，上海公共租界，與廈門公共租界行政權領事裁判權及其他特權，已因法國之非法行爲（按：當時法方遠犯國際公法妄與僞組織簽約歸還租界）關於消滅，中國政府不再受其拘束。」又據外交部於三十四年十二月三日公佈，「法國大使館頃已允立即封閉其在華領事法庭，」同月十四日外交部又公佈「查各國在華所享治外法權，均已取消，我法院不應承認任何國家尚在我領土行使治外法權，」准此，則法總領所稱各節，更不能成爲其違法逮捕人犯之理由。</p>
<p>我外交部一再聲明</p>
<p>此外，凡外籍人員有勾結敵人危害中國及盟邦之行爲者，外交部亦一再聲明我方有逮捕審判之權，於三十四年十月二十四日外交部公佈云：「關於處置在華外　附敵分子，我軍事當局已決予逮捕，移交法院審判，惟該項罪犯如同時曾在盟國統治區域內犯案，而其案情較爲重大則爲移交盟方懲辦。」同年十二月二十二日外交部並令駐滬辦事處云。上海天津北平等市，及其他收復區域，外籍人員在日本佔領期間。有勾結敵人危害中國及盟邦之行爲者，我依中外新約有權逮捕審判，除由軍事委員會通令陸軍總部及各戰區長官部，並由司法行政部通令各級法院遵辦外，合行令仰遵照，協同當地法院及有關機關辦理」云云。依據上述公佈之令文，法國總領事在本市擅行捕人，侵犯我主權，更不能輕易視之也。</p>

<h3>救濟用西式舊衣禁止出售或交換　劉鴻生氏昨發表談話</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕行政院善後救濟總署上海分署署長劉鴻生，昨答本報記者叩詢各點，對近日外間所傳各節，有所解釋，茲特分誌如下：</p>
<p>盤尼西林未能普售</p>
<p>記者詢（一）該署分發各慈善團體之大批西式舊衣，難民穿着旣不適體，又不足禦寒，或謂將整批出售再另行購入中式棉衣，分署方面是否有所風聞？答，該批舊衣係盟邦人民友誼捐贈作救濟之用，規定不得以任何方式出售，以杜流弊。西裝雖或較欠溫暖，但總比無衣爲佳，故在未接獲總署其他命令以前，一概禁止出售，或以交換方式取得其他物品，此即目前分署之立塲。（二）問，近日盤尼西林充斥黑市，而醫院藥房於是項藥品反感極度缺乏，有何補救方法？答，目前市上盤尼西林絕非該署所有品，因該項藥品已運到者不多，故尚不能大規模普遍分配各衛生機關，只能于遭遇若干病症，必需以本品作爲特效藥時，始能考慮配給。倘使普遍應用於任何輕微疾病，則恐現有所存量于數日內即可用罄。爲統筹計，不得不審愼將事，故短期內各醫院藥房或尚不能普遍應市。</p>
<p>組視察團提供意見</p>
<p>又該分署特派視察何方理，技正謝章浙，專員林式幹等七人，組成一視察團，於昨日淸晨出發視察各慈善機關等，團體醫院，將來提出視察意見俾資改進。</p>

<h3>貫通本市交通擴展南北幹綫</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市工務局對於馬路工程，特注重擴展南北交通幹綫，蓋戰前本市公共租界，法租界及市中心區各有其交通制度，如公共租界之竭力向西發展，伸展至越界築路，致成畸形發展。現工務局已着手加寬浙江路界路及北西藏路，河南路之工程，亦正計劃中。將來擬將市中心·閘北·黄浦區及南市全部打成一片，使本市交通可四通八達。</p>
<p>又該　修理路面，已完工者計八萬餘平方公尺，達應修者之四分之一。</p>

<p>昨日又有日俘七千名，上午在市中心廣塲集中檢查，下午分乘日輪「辰日丸，」及美方登陸艦五艘離滬，查此爲日僑俘第七批之遣歸。</p>

<p>美軍總部情報部報告，盜賣美軍用品之美軍廿五人，內有官長數人，現已在等候審訊處罰中。彼等盜賣物品包括鐘表·照相機·儀器·衣服·食品·藥品·香烟等，價值美金五萬元之巨，彼等現在等候美軍審判委會之處以徒刑在五年至十年之判決。</p>
<h3>美軍肇禍司機　昨被拘禁</h3>
<p>美海軍司機却萊，昨晚在南京路上駕車肇禍，一中國少女名陳惠貞者當塲殞命，撞傷兩人。却萊今日巳被海軍當局拘禁。據證人聲述肇事經過情形如次：該司機所開軍用卡車駛近南京路處治卿路時，接連撞倒三輪車數輛，電車一輛，電車月合上路人數名，亦被撞倒，其中一人即名陳惠貞者。警察當局宣稱：該司機所開卡車，並未獲得許可，似係酒醉所致。按此次卡車肇禍情形，與一月前亞爾培路上撞車經過頗爲相彷。</p>

<h3>薪給所得稅規定課征標準</h3>
<p>薪水階級之得稅，應如何計　一問題，久爲一般從業員所　　，上海直接稅局前經公告，以底薪爲標準，所有因戰時物價波動而增加之生活補助費，臨時津貼，米貸金等，均不計算在內，惟本市從業員之有底薪規定者，因不在少，而一般薪水階級，每月所得率無薪津部份之劃分，對於是項所得，究應如何計課，尚不易明瞭，據上海直接稅局負負人稱，各業從業員之無底薪規定者，其薪津應如何劃分，自應規定標定，爲求合理公平起見，該局現參照公務員俸給津貼數額規定劃分辦法，即以每月薪津之總數，減去當地公務員之米貸金及生活補助費數額，再除以當地公務員俸給加倍數，求得課稅所得額，然後根據此數，按照稅率表計課，並擬定公式一種，以便計算。</p>
<h3>英商萬流輪昨由渝抵滬</h3>
<p>招商局江順輪，定明晨駛漢，全裝救濟品，太古公司萬流輪前日自渝經漢抵滬，該輪原係川江淺水船，戰事期內，與嘉定輪，停頓萬渝間，萬流損壞甚鉅，嘉定輪尚無期下駛。又該公司岳州輪，定十一日復航駛香港，怡和永生輪，同時駛港，招商局南北洋綫現尚無開航期。</p>
<h3>工協會商定舉辦工業展覽</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕全國工業協會於昨晚聚餐，到胡西園·劉攻芸·吳蘊初·彭學沛·張茲　等，決定於二月中舉辦全國工業展覽會，將由川·桂等地遷歸之工廠多家參加。該會並擬於政治協商會議開幕前，向協商會表明該會意見，計有下列數點：</p>

<h3>高等法院刑庭昨日審訊兩漢奸　周逆懿判無期徒刑</h3>
<p>丁逆觀萍，杭州人，四十歲，畢業於復旦及東吳法科，曾充任僞南京糧食管理委員會蘇北辦事處處長，僞上海地方檢察署看守所所長，被訴漢奸一案，昨日上午，由上海高等法院刑庭長劉毓桂，推事曹駿·祝宗海·檢察官林我明，在提籃橋臨時刑庭開合議庭復審。</p>
<p>出任偽職採辦糧米</p>
<p>先由林檢察官陳述起訴要旨，略稱被告於民國三十一年八月，出任僞糧管委會蘇北辦事處處長，及民國三十四年二月，出任僞上海地檢署看守所所長之職，爲敵僞採購糧食，觸犯懲治漢奸條例第二條第一款第五款之罪，應請庭上依法審判云。繼由丁逆供稱：「我掛任僞糧食管理委員會蘇北辦事處處長之職『職』，共計八個月，至三十二年三月該委員會撤銷，改組爲『糧食部』時辭職。蘇北區共轄揚州·寶應·泰州·高郵·興化·五縣，我兼任揚州採辦主任，以揚州產米，自給尚虞不足，故請免予採辦，而其他四縣之採辦工作，由糧管會另委專員辦理，我僅監督而已，故我實未負實際採辦之責任。至蘇北地區之採購，所得食米，均用於京滬地區配給民食之用，可調取南京僞糧管會及僞前上海糧食局之卷宗證明，如查出有供給敵用，則儘請處以極刑。所謂亂臣賊子，人人得而誅之，雖死無寃。至出「任」僞上海看守所所長任內，曾舉辦改進衛生，疏通囚犯等工作，請庭上詳予調查，以明事實。」庭上對被告所請求吊閱僞南京糧管會，爲上海看守所卷宗各節，舉行評議，裁定對吊閱南京僞糧管會一點，因被告供述已詳，毋庸吊取。至請吊僞上海糧食局，及看守所卷宗一點，應予照准。並希被告律師繕具節略呈院，俾逐點調查，並向被告略訊一過，以本案尚須調證，遂宣告改期再訊，被告還押。</p>
<p>恐嚇詐財調戲婦女</p>
<p>高院昨又審理任意調戲婦女，恐嚇詐財之漢奸徐行，該犯現年二十歲，蘇州人，在辛莊充當僞檢問員。檢察官以憑藉敵僞勢力，欺壓敲詐人民提起公訴。徐奸常堂痛哭失聲，否認此說。繼傳被害人楊松濤出庭作證，據稱：我騎自行車運米經過辛莊，「檢間所」徐行穿着制服前來檢問，勒索五千元。我以本小利薄，苦苦哀求，徐逆非但不允，且打我兩記耳光，並聲言將貨充公，以為恫嚇。不得已付以五千元了事。又稱：辛莊二百餘人，個個痛恨徐逆，所供如不確實，甘願反坐。次訊被害人陳警昌，據稱：曾親見徐逆調戲婦女云云。至此，徐達復放聲大哭，仍堅不吐實，後由指定律師費席珍答辯，略謂：被告在該所充當額外檢問員，不能列入漢奸條例論耶，請求移交地方法院辦理。庭上以本案辯論終結，定於本月十四日下午二時宣判。</p>
<p>為敵招工無期徒刑</p>
<p>招募勞工，充任　譯之周逆　為，已於昨日下午宣判，其判決主文抄錄如下：周　爲通謀敵國，招募軍用人工夫役，判處無期徒刑，褫奪公權終生，全部財產沒收。</p>
<h3>本市財政困難正商資委會協助</h3>
<p>市府秘書長沈　華談，本市稅收，在財政局整頓之下，雖已頗有增加，但以原由地方政府徵收之十七種稅捐，已有十二種遵令劃歸中央，值茲復興工作展開伊始，百廢待舉，需費浩繁，現有捐稅收入，殊難藉以抵補，惟本市建設工作，亟待推進，勢難以財政拮据，遂至因噎廢食，除竭力　節政費而外，並正商由資源委員會予以協助，不久期間諒可獲致具體辦法。關於戰前所發市政公債整理辦法，沈氏謂在財政局縝密研究之中。</p>
<h3>匪徒勒索鉅款當被警員擊斃</h3>

<p>李澤被該公司職員舒月橋等，控訴漢奸嫌疑一案，日前由本市警察局傳訊，李澤未到。告發人舒月橋到庭陳述，李澤曾任僞「間統會會」理事，僞「十六種商品評價委員會」委員，僞「敵產委員會」委員等職，幷將公司內所有水汀管子出賣與日本軍部等語。並由該公司職員姚卓人等四人作證，供詞略同，該局以李澤抗傳不到，業於昨日下午二時，將李澤拘獲。</p>
<p>漢奸罪嫌依法審理</p>
<p>訊得李澤供認曾任偽「商統會」等理事，所有水汀係出　與某鐵廠等語。警局以李澤所爲漢奸罪　，業已證實，當於下午五時，將李犯解送上海高等法院，依照懲治漢奸條例第二條第五款依法審理。該公司全體職員三百餘人並已聯名呈請警備總司令部，檢舉李澤通敵，警備總部稽查處對該案業予受理，對李澤通敵各點，現正嚴密偵查中，決以嚴正態度處理該案云。</p>
<p>職工檢舉李澤逆跡</p>
<p>新新公司職工於昨日午後二時，假該公司同人俱樂部，招待本市新聞界。首由職工代表韓武成報告，向各關係方面檢舉李澤逆跡經過，惟呈文去後，倐已三月有餘，而處置辦法，則仍如石沉大海，近目聞李澤將啓程赴美，以避法綱，故特商請新聞界二點：一爲如何依法律根據，從速檢舉李澤。二爲各關係當局，迄未有任何措施表示應如何促使注意，以免巨奸　綱。末並列舉刊載李澤充任僞職及罪行之報紙，及其發行日期爲證。繼由代表舒月橋報告其檢舉之經過，迭遭挫折。據稱自檢舉李澤後，家中不時有怪客發現，威脅恫嚇，而其檢舉奸逆之初衷，始終屹然不動。最後各代表復分別報告稱：李澤自去年八月十日後，即陸續將其重要私產，移轉分散，近且拋售大批囤積貨品，如絨錢布疋等，大批李氏名下之股票，亦經分別辦理過戶手續云　。</p>
<p>軍警當局設法偵查</p>
<p>散會後各記者又分別訪問警察局老閘分局，及淞滬警備司令部等當局。老閘分局認爲此事應依法照辦，在偵查完畢前，未便有所措施，或發表意見。對新新公司職工張貼佈告宣傳，認爲吸引行人駐觀，阻　交通，故加以取締。淞滬警備司令部當局，則透露李澤確於昨午被逮。</p>
<p>記者復於事後趨訪新新公司經理當局，據稱：李澤業向該公司董事會請假，董事會准給假一月。叩以李澤被逮之事，則稱不明詳情。繼稱該公司職工此次檢舉李澤，與該公司業務並無牴觸，故公司仍照常營業。</p>
<p>刊登啓事如此解釋</p>
<p>新新公司董事會今日在各報刊登啓事，爲李澤中述，大意謂：（一）該公司聘用日籍顧問，以應付敵僞壓迫，及個人安全，別無其他作用。（二）獻鐵實係日人征用水汀，故將該項水汀售於森大鐵廠。（三）關於派員赴偽滿參加慶祝，係當時僞實業部派員至公司選購國產，據稱係運往僞滿博覽會者，此事與李澤無關等話。</p>

<h3>美鈔形勢穩健金價突然上漲　公債股票均起回風</h3>
<p>烚赤昨以前昨報載天津及關外金價報昂，吸引零星買戶，上塲即升至八一萬五，此後人心見金市有機可乘，求過於供，即自八一萬三逐步盤好至八三萬五以上，此際證劵大戶重施故智，售金拉股，午刻在八三萬內外盤旋，午後股市游資陸續歸來，最後步漲至八五萬以上，結果較上週六急漲五萬三，銀樓飾金掛九萬，紋銀六百元，銀允仍在四百三左右盤旋，暗拆證劵帮頗多需用，息價仍站定一角左右，股市游資連日歸來，至本日而益明顯，前途當趨然漲。</p>
<p>美鈔仍無特殊變化，聞金市同進退，套頭則在五八五元對十兩差價下出入不一，自一四二五元逐步盤好至一四六〇元，結果較上週六好起五十元，港票仍極平庸，以致新老貨俱與上週相彷彿　公債漲後回跌，業中多頭逢高紛紛了結，丙種遂自九六五元逐步下降，中途雖不乏散多支持，無奈大勢已去，哄抬乏勁，遂破九百元大關，而以平庸局面結束，結果較上週六熱門跌而雜牌尚昇，此乃時間關係，未及趕上。</p>
<p>華股以證券帮重施故智，釜底捕薪於先，金蟬脫壳於後，市况遂初俏後疲，中途一度重被拉高，迨午時三刻，大戶掉首不願，散戶紛起斬殺，爲時已晚，境况遂極凄慘，永紗曾兩度拉高至一〇六〇元新高峯，而以最低價九八〇元賣出結束，美亞亦屢見八三〇元高價，最低七二〇元尚無人要，新光等三小熱亦較高價時回小一成餘收市，結果與上週六相較，計永紗平，美亞跌十五元，三小熱則微挫五角至一元，惟冷門各股則以時間關係，尚呈燦爛景色。</p>
<p>外股求供紛沓，一波三折，大致隨華股而進退，初堅後疲，近午又形拉上，但各股連漲多時，已　飽和，多方獲利，頗有可觀，不乏見機了結者，籌碼已由緊轉鬆，潛勢已有裂痕，結果熱門各股較之上週六榮辱互見，橡皮股因較爲冷落，收價雖較高昂，但屬供方喊價。</p>
<h3>紗市漲風未已</h3>
<p>昨日紗市益見挺秀，晨初開市，一哄而上，客帮銷路，已不若上週之踴躍，然散戶心思者高，吸買不已，同時傳聞證劵大樓有某某號即日起經營棉紗小額買賣，以申新第一廠之廿支紅人鐘棧單爲籌碼，頗受投機家之靑睐，價做七十七八萬之間，現紗市塲因是而益與奮，廿支普通紗約漲五萬左右，特雙馬以連日所跳已巨，廣帮買稍遜，只升二三萬，成交八十七八萬，細紗及雙綫，織廠襪廠仍來拖進，在現貨奇缺之情况下，又漲十萬。</p>
<h3>米市交易呆滯</h3>
<p>米糧閘北河下一帶存船的百餘號，而南市河下亦有存積百餘艘，市化呆滯，粳米薄稻早稻依然少神而乏交，秈米因產區高昂，形成倒懸，故車到甚少，市勢尚定，白元彷彿，麵粉南洋去路仍續，市勢堅挺，黄豆到貨稀寥，閩帮興化泉州續辦，形趨穩固，油市以浙方寗方動辦，價續升千元，生仁芝蔴牢立，豆餅微升數十元，汕頭略取，菜餅立定，酒價平穩。</p>
<h3>絲綢一致向上</h3>
<p>昨日絲綢行市，一致步俏，人造絲晨開盤一百二十號天橋七十七萬元，因各綢廠進胃頗濃，同行交易不寂，現貨缺乏，更因傳說敵僞倉庫開放無期，以致市塲空氣濃厚，人心向榮，售價步步高翔，迄收盤一百二十號天橋高達八十五萬元，半光八十三萬元，惟傳聞華商倉庫開放在即以後，綢廠所需，或能源源供應，吾則恐將造成無米爲炊之高面，廠絲銷路不惡價亦升騰，高勻度每擔一百三十萬元，中檔每擔一百十萬元，普通九十萬元，綢市因原料昂貴，成本激漲，售盤略提高，美亞被面每百條五十五萬元，大誠格子璧縐每碼一千六百元，民生織錦緞每件八千五百元。</p>
<h3>煤球零銷奇暢煤市趨勢漸穩</h3>
<p>煤及柴炭，實消不寂，來源絡繹，行情尚稱平穩，煤球爲一般家庭用戶必備燃料，前因其主要原料白煤屑來源不暢。少數煤球製造業雜以煤渣代用，致品質次劣，火力不强，信譽全失，茲以原料來源有望，電動力供應暢通，煤球製造業均提高品質，以利營業，加之時入冬令，煤球除爲一般家庭之經常燃料外，並可取暖，故消耗驟增，實銷奇暢，目前保含五成煤屑之普通保燒煤球，其製造成本每噸約爲四萬五千元，（直接原料三萬五千元，直接人工三千元。製造費用七千元，）煤店門市零售每担的三千元之請，次次等則自一千五百元至二千元不等。</p>
<h3>柏油求過於供</h3>
<p>柏油因燭淘需用正繁，行家不數供應，來源更日見稀少，所以行家及燭淘坊均向各產地採辦，聞行家向嘉興辦成本率百數十件，價格爲一萬八千元，燭坊辦成亦數十件，價格爲一萬八千五百元，均禾交，又向杭州辦到蘭油爲一萬五千五百元至六千元，向蘭溪辦成爲一萬二千五百元至三千元不等，均就地交貨，額共數百件，不日即可裝到，行售禾本油二萬二千元，蘭油尖貨一萬八千元，次至一萬六千元，求過於供，勢尚看俏。</p>
<h3>煙兌市場復業後規定交易辦法</h3>
<p>烟兌市塲復業後，規定市塲交易，如於上午成交者，必須於當日下午六時前繳款出貨，下午成交者，則須於隔日上午十二時前理交淸楚，若有任何一方延期違約，必須賠償對方損失，當貨漲時，須照當日市價，於價跌時，除損失外，尚須照付利息。</p>
<h3>客幫實銷發動　紙價逐步高昂　尤以白報紙最甚</h3>
<p>洋紙於開關後，逐步向上，原因在定貨到埠無期，而客幫則實銷已動，取銷觀望態度，落手猛進，且存底淺薄，求過於供，本日又以金價上漲，美鈔隨昂之故，紙價堅俏更甚，其間各貨，尤以白報紙爲最，蓋去胃最多也。</p>
<h3>經濟簡報</h3>
<p>浙東土產源源而來，平安局大華輪前（星期日）到滬，由溫州運來砂糖三千包，木板二千餘件，該輪明晨開往福州，自滬運閩麵粉二千包，返滬時尚有大批建　運來。</p>
<p>本市機製煤球業同業公會全體同業集資向長江沿岸一帶產煤區採辦大宗白煤屑，茲因裝煤船隻元利輪尚滯留揚州，故該採辦團不得不延期出發。</p>
<p>戰後合作事業五年計劃，定於一月開始實行，據悉：擬於未來五年中，成立合作社一十八萬九千零一十九單位，並不包括目前全國業已成立之三十六萬零九百四十三單位在內。</p>
<p>偽滿三十四年僞中央銀行發行之僞鈔，其準備金約佔百分之六十左右，政府當局爲顧及此種事實，對東北流通劵之比值，聞已決定和滿洲僞鈔等值，即流通一元等於僞鈔一元。</p>
<p>全國土地稅，將於本年度起開始收徵，據悉包括下列三項：（一）田賦，（二）契稅，（三）地界稅，三十五年度，土地稅部份，歲入預算約九百餘億云。</p>
<p>法幣在基隆之調換率，約折合二十五元至三十元不等，現中央銀行設台之辦事處，正積極計劃收換，該地黄金價格，每兩約合台幣三千四百元。</p>
<p>財政部本年度行政經費預算，約五百三十三億餘元，內經常費約五十五億餘元，事業費三億餘元，生活補助費四百四十億餘元，臨時費三十一億餘元。</p>
<p>北平我方接收之北支製鐵株式會社石景山製鐵所，號稱資本三萬萬，日前已接收完竣，該礦計劃每日出鐵一千二百噸，在日本投降前已能每日出鐵五百噸，較龍烟礦時代每日二百五十噸，增加一倍。</p>
<h3>商情撮要</h3>
<p>靑糖向以杭州爲匯集地，今杭市告漲，影響本市糖價，較前市上昇五千元之譜，又四五白市亦俏缺。</p>
<p>南北貨生仁市迭見提升，柿餅及紅棗市稀售盤連續告升，黑棗高牌貨缺，價亦猛晋不已，金菜黑木耳及笋干均以客意看好，扳價甚緊，</p>
<p>海味行家見金市報漲，跟蹤而上，各貨開盤即升高，較上市高約二三成，</p>
<p>綿布染色貨客帮追逐甚亟，染織廠本待儘意供售，惜白坯根子仍舊緊俏，市况在高峯中挺進百合干因今年出產甚少，到存俱缺，茲以廣東去化漸動，市勢至緊，現市身干色白之貨，行售三萬元，普通二萬五千元，聞產區存底甚乏。</p>
<p>茶葉本街店莊及津帮買胃不寂，全市成交粗毛紅茶中品湖紅徽州烘靑等茶四百五十餘祖，行情見俏，</p>
<p>昨日針織品市况，堪稱無物不漲，三二支襪子及毛巾尤甚，究其原因，則為受各黄金紗價兩者之影響。</p>
<p>昨日捲烟市况，以市塲開業，且金市向榮，買氣見活，雖有派貨，俏勢不爲所抑，全日行情在步挺中。</p>
<p>桐油交易廖寥，蓋以目前銷路已屆尾聲，故買戶納胃不力，行情亦呈呆滯狀態，一五一七度白油每担二萬六千元，洪江油每桶喊二萬元左右。</p>

<h3>錦旗拾錦</h3>
<p>— 陳封雄</p>
<p>錦州氣候較北平稍令，一起微風，氣溫頓降。最近曾冷至〇下二十並，國軍中很多廣東籍士兵，已領略寒風貶骨的滋味。他們一提起還要到更冷的瀋陽去，雖正圍爐，也不禁要縮着勃子作一個發抖的姿勢。</p>
<p>錦州市內還有許多奇怪詞句的標語沒有洗刷乾凈，譬如日人所設之大興公司（現爲交通部瀋陽區接收委員辦公處及無綫電台）門上端所油漆的『沒有××黨便沒有中國』橫幅標語，每字二尺見方。雖經多次洗刷，仍淸晰可見。</p>
<p>柏油馬路有許多地方掘了戰壕，是國軍入城前日本人被迫掘成準備抵抗的。現在日本人又正忙着填平那些有交通的戰壕。據當地人對記者說：那些戰壕根本沒利用過。</p>
<p>據說偽錦州鐵道局（現在是東北保安司令長官部）當國軍入城時，那座大樓內已　了煤油，沒來得及放火國軍便入城了。錦州只有鴛話局被炸毀，三層鋼骨水泥的樓房炸掉了一半多，現在正有工人忙着修補。此外，最慘的便是僞錦州省公署，燒了三天三夜，燒得片瓦無存。當地人說：「那裏面的好柬西可眞不少，要什麼有什麼，全燒啦！」</p>
<p>錦州城西的小淩河，現在已乾涸，河上有三座橋都炸斷，兩座鐵橋，是鐵路大橋，一座水泥橋，是公路橋，都是四五百公尺長。現在鐵橋已修好，即將變軌通車，公路橋被炸斷一節，據說炸了六次才炸斷。十二月十六日聽說蔣主席要從北平到錦州視察，而小凌河的公路橋又是從飛機塲入城必經之路，長官部臨時徵集了四百名日本人，燃着汽燈通宵工作，算是在河床及兩岸間修了一條簡陋的汽車路。可惜蔣主席因公忙無暇飛錦，老百姓不免有一些惆悵。</p>
<p>錦州的特產是滷蝦油和蘋菓，　蝦油一大瓶只賣十元，比重慶的水還便宜。蘋菓香脆可口，味絕佳，每斤三十元。杜長官聽說蔣主席要視察錦州後，特命人買了三大簍蘋菓（每簍約百斤）預備獻給主席帶回重慶。不知現在那些蘋菓是否已幸運的躺在林園官邸的菓盤內。</p>
<p>錦州的物價無法和重慶比，因爲沒有標準。經杜長官蓋章的法幣與僞滿劵等值行使，但因劵額過大（起碼五百元，商人無法找零，所以市面一直不活躍。譬如買一個鷄蛋要四元五，國軍士兵一拿出來便是一千元，要小商人找回九百幾十元實在爲難。國軍當然沒有其他的票子，因此商人只好說：『同志，等你有零錢的時候再給我們吧，幾塊錢沒關係，我們實在找不開士兵也說：『掌櫃，你要認淸我的符號啊，我不拐騙你的！』大家一團和氣：商人們重見天日，遮不住衷心的喜悅，常常慷慨的免費招待士兵。有些商人恐怕顧主以大票子買他的貨，便只拿出少量的貨到市上賣，把他的貨全部買下來也只有數十元，非用小票不可，他賣完了再回去又拿一點出來。有些人根本關了門不作生意，或者把東西藏起來，你向他買什麼都沒有。記者初抵錦州，借了數千元想去吃飯，跑遍了錦州城找不着一家正式的飯館。最後走進一家只賣高粱米飯和豆腐湯的小店，店伙劈頭一句便說：『先生吃飯要用小票啊！』記者只好又餓着肚子回旅邸。</p>
<p>杜長官下令絕對禁止商人出入山海關套購貨物。有幾個天津商人帶了一些貨物在錦州偷偸賣了，又買了許多棉綫（每扎千餘元，到天津可售二萬元）。在火車站被擋駕，只好又把棉綫廉價拋出。住了幾天小店，帶了一些在關內毫無價值的僞滿劵回天津了。</p>
<p>五十元以下的法幣，雖未經杜長官蓋章，也可以使用。記者袋內有四張十元鈔票，在重慶一直沒有機會用出去，而跑到錦州竟理了髮，又買了一斤蘋菓。日本商人也歡迎小額法幣。至少法幣印得比僞劵精細得多。</p>
<p>現在錦州中央銀行已開業，流通券已發出。聽說市面比前些日子活潑得多。舊城南關外是錦州娛樂區，有戲院影院與妓院，最近開業的日本妓院都在新城內，生意不惡。有時在街上看見一兩個花枝招展的日本妓女乘三輪車馳過，使人覺得好像在荒山中發現了一株玫瑰似的。</p>
<p>東關外是市集塲所，數百小販州攤擺着地賣些零碎舊物，食物攤也不過是燒餅，大麥粥，關東糖之類。那些小販一聽見外省口音的主顧問價，便漫天要價。因爲他們知道那都是身藏大票的闊佬。</p>

<h3>靠右走的笑話</h3>
<p>— 毛樹奎</p>
<p>今天是實行車輛右行的第八犬，市民已由新奇而漸漸習慣，人力車，三輪車很自然的靠右走，汽車自知是禍根，所以小心翼翼的開着，速度顯然慢了許多，唯有盟軍的吉普卡照舊風馳電掣的來去，原來他們正是習慣右行的，如今駕輕就熟，無怪其然了，這幾天中雖然和平日一樣，仍有幾起車輛肇禍的事發生，但考其原因，倒很少是右行而引起的。各馬路的十字路口也可說秩序井然。這是事前努力宣傳的効果吧？</p>
<p>英國的時代日報，在去年十月份突然刋出了一篇描寫我國陪都第一天車輛改右行的紊亂情形，什麼汽車撞了人力車，人力車拉上了人行道，牛嘶馬呌一團糟。原來我國車輛右行本定於去年十月一日起實行，後來敵人屈膝了，有受降接收等更重要的事要做，所以延期到今年元旦，這位駐重慶的時代日報記者先生，大概先憑理想寫好稿子，早就寄回本國，以備到期刊登，後來我國展期了，他卻忘了展期，才鬧了這個笑話。由此可見在外國人的意料中，我國把沿習了數十年的靠左走，一旦要改靠右走是多　難的事，不能否認移風易俗不是椿容易的事，尤其在擁有各式車輛十二萬七千餘輛的上海。但事實告訴我們，幾天來的成績足以使這位時代日報的「預言家」感到慚愧，我祈禱盟軍的吉普卡因適合了他們右行的習慣，今後將不再發生肇禍的事情，同時希望全市的車輛小心不懈，繼續以不流血的方式來完成這歷史性的大改革。</p>

<h3>重慶點滴</h3>
<p>— 梅幼雲</p>
<p>從元旦起，人力車伕在鬧市上吆喝着一片「右手聲」，不再聽見他們呌「左手」了。「車馬靠右行，行人靠邊走」的標語，初出現時，曾有人說過：「格老子！車馬靠右行，左邊留把那個走？」不知那位先生現在想通了沒有？</p>
<p>各書店都掛出了「新年大廉價」的旗幟，雖然門庭若市，却仍購者無幾。大都是站着看看完走的朋友，因爲可以隨便翻儘管看，比上圖書館借書省不少麻煩，這能怪「看書者」嗎？不！喜歡在這裏找書看的人，多半是不喜歡或是不善於「弄錢」的人。</p>
<p>電影院爲着爭票價而停業，要求免除捐稅。票價實收五百元一張，政府方面旣不願減少稅收，又不願增加市民負担，問題尚在「僵持」中。</p>
<p>山城舞風日熾。揚子江舞廳赴滬延聘之「上海舞娘」，已到渝執行「導舞員」「職務」，開始工作。</p>

<h3>不怒</h3>
<p>— 大廈</p>
<p>怒氣的爆發，是由許多小小的煩惱堆積而成的。多數的人們，尤其是靑年，都有怒氣的潛伏或勃發。我們考究怒氣之來，大都由於外界的壓迫，心緒的不寗，不能安靜自制所致。與人交往時，受到委屈侮辱，於是激動我們的心弦，而設法發洩之。好像一根彈簧打了一下，必然要振盪一樣。</p>
<p>心理學家斯達登敎授他認爲「怒氣是一種人類天性的表現，人人可以發怒。但是因怒而生出許多災難，怨恨。」他認爲發怒是一件冒險的事情，發怒可以離問，其悲慘的結果，便是破壞友誼和同事。心理學家爲了人類的怒氣研究出很多的方法去管制和引導之。關於發怒的心理狀態，多數心理學家都認爲應當用一種安全活塞適當地去加以制止。發怒好像汽的發洩一樣，汽有時多的時候，機器跟不上要惹出亂子來，則應當用一種稱安全塞，把「氣」關住。</p>
<p>受到別人的氣就要發　，那是一件很不值得的事情。你應當約束你的憤怒，找求某種發洩憤怒的適富方法，要無害於你的情緒。如打拳，唱戲等。心理學家說，「在一種非常的情况中，遇到別人發怒時，最好的應付辦法，是保持冷靜，淸楚，而心地平和地對付對方。」</p>
<p>有的時候憤怒的到來，反可以光大我們的前途。我們要把憤怒導引爲一種積極的行動，以增進自己的事業。老子在道德經裏說，「善爲士者不武，善戰者不怒，善勝敵者不與，善用人者爲之下。是爲不爭之德，是謂用人之力，是謂配夫古之極。」裏面的善戰者不怒，也就是說，「不怒的人是有得勝的把握的。」「不怒」是良好的處世箴言。</p>
<p>教育</p>
<h3>學籍留額金</h3>
<p>— 雁秋</p>
<p>在每一學期結束之前二三個星期，學校當局即籌備着留額金的問題。我們的學校當然也不能例外。上星期五接到了學校裏留額金的通車單，其內容如下：</p>
<p>「每生應繳留額金法幣一千元正，自×月×日起至×月×日止。如該生不繳留額金而下學期仍來校者，作新生論。如繳留額金而下學期不來校者，該費槪不退還」云云。</p>
<p>由以上通知單看來，可見收留額鑫的目的在於金錢，而不在於留額。從什麼地方看出來的呢？但看通知單上說：繳而不來，概不退還。這可知道只知進而不知出了，並且規定繳付留額金的限期，係在放學之前，也不知道下學期的學費應繳若干？假如下一學期的學費公佈後，做家長的無力負担道一筆學費，那豈不是白費了一千元的留額金嗎？現在我倒有一個辦法，未知妥善吾？</p>
<p>辦法是留額金母不法幣，而代以書信。由學生的家畏書一留額信，簽名蓋章，以免開玩笑性質。證明該生下學期仍來校肄業，如若下一學期學費過昂，無力求學，可得由家長用信而辭却。</p>

<h3>士兵待遇問題</h3>
<p>— 書槑</p>
<p>「魏吳起奔楚說楚悼王以富國强兵之道，曰：「楚國地方數千里，帶甲百餘萬，固宜雄壓諸侯，世爲盟主，所以不能加於列國者，養兵之道失也，夫養兵之道、先阜其財，後用其力，今不急之官布滿朝署，疎遠之族糜費公廩，而戰士升斗僅食之餘，欲使捐軀殉國，不亦難乎。大王誠聽臣計，汰冗官，斥疎族，盡稟祿，以待敢戰之士，如是而國威不振，則臣諸伏妄言之誅，」悼王從其計，羣臣多謂起言不可用，悼王不聽，於是使吳起評定官制，凡削去冗官數百員，大臣子弟不得夤緣竊祿又公族五世以上者，令自食其力，比於編氓，五世以下酌其遠近，以次裁之，所省國賦數萬，選國中精銳之士，朝夕訓練，閱其財器，以上下其廩食，有加厚至數倍者，士卒莫不競勒，楚遂以兵雄視天下，」</p>
<p>前幾天在某報上看到一個士兵的呼籲，大意是說一個月的餉銀僅三四百元，派什麼用塲也不够。言下似乎覺得他們過去的餐風宿露，出死入生，着實有些「不值得」。</p>
<p>這該是一椿很不好的現象，可會因這種心理的演變，而養成相當嚴重的不幸？</p>
<p>偶讀戰國策，看到一篇講改良士兵待遇的文章，不禁因之發生甚多感觸，錄之，或許可以作爲一種參考。</p>

<h3>郵遞火箭</h3>
<p>— 君宜</p>
<p>火箭原是空戰的利器，最近却已可用於郵遞工作了。發明人爲英國著名科學家哈里敎授，哈氏曾服務於皇家空軍隊很久，他研究的目的，原在便利情報傳遞的敏捷，戰事結東後，就預備改用於郵遞了。哈氏研究郵遞火箭，開始於一九四一年，他不但將所有的財產耗於研究工作，還向他服務的總部裏借了一筆債。</p>
<p>去年九月間，哈氏曾在英國北部黑池一度試驗郵遞火箭，成績非常美滿，此項火箭之構造，哈里至今尚未正式公佈，惟僅知重量較軍用火箭減輕五分之三，而其成分則多含鋁質，因此輕便非常，速率亦可比軍甩火箭增加十倍，一枝火箭從倫敦發出，五十三分鐘後就可抵達美國舊金山了。</p>

<h3>美國資源損失</h3>
<p>— 鮑鍾佐</p>
<p>美國在此次戰爭中，天然資源的損失極大。據美政府請密的估計，自一九四一年至一九四五年間，已用去石油礦源的四分之一，鐵鑛資源的十分之七，銅五分之一，鉛及鋅四分之一。又據美國礦務局預測，天然煤氣貯量祗可用四十九年；銅二十九年；鋅十九年；石油十八年；金十四年；鉛十二年；銀十一年。其他如鎢，鉑，汞，石綿，錳，鎳及鋅，幾已用罄，尚需經年依靠外洋輸入。</p>
<p>此種美國缺少的金屬，在工業上均極重要。譬如鎢能增加鋼的硬度，用以高速切斷必需截短的大量產品。</p>

<h3>電影院不許兒童入院之解答</h3>
<p>— 宋國賓</p>
<p>本題見上月二十八日本欄，鄙人以衛生的立塲，醫學的觀點，解答如下：傳染病之傳染途徑，以口鼻爲最多，口鼻者，身體與外界接觸之門戶也，夏日疾病如：傷寒，霍亂，痢疾，疫痢等，均借口傳染；冬季疾病如：流行感冒，肺炎，痧疹，白喉，腦膜炎等均借鼻傳染，（古時不識病菌，認爲「邪氣」作祟，實則多數病菌，均御風而行，借氣傳染「邪氣」一名，未嘗不可適用），此類病菌，由病者或帶菌者，借咳嗽而播散空中，他人由鼻嗅入，遂成傳染之勢，雖然傳染條件並非如此簡單，多數病菌甚爲脆弱，非有適宜之環境不易滋生，一遇乾燥低溫，遂失其繁殖之力，最適當之傳染環境，殆莫過於遊戲之公衆塲所，值茲冬令，窗戶緊閉，暖氣開放，空氣旣不流通，而溫度與濕度又極適宜於病菌之生存，故座中如有病人或帶菌者，咳嗽一聲，病菌即四散活動，侵製鄰座，而達其傳染之攻勢，兒童身體嬌弱，尤易感染，且咳者不止一人，一咳之下，感染者亦不止一人，傳播者不止一病，此所以上述諸病於冬春之間易成流行之勢也，故以愚見觀之，非獨遊藝塲所兒童不宜抑足，即患咳嗽之成年人，亦應自動裹足不前，以免貽害他人，此不僅有關於公衆衛生，亦且有益於衛生道德之提倡，質諸公衆，以爲何如？</p>
<p>本文係上海衛生局顧問宋國賓醫師所著，憑其豐富之學術與經騐，當然極有價值。甚望讀者注意：已患傳染病，勿隨便涉足公共塲所，以免殃及他人；家長爲愛護幼年子女，亦愼勿冒險携帶入塲，如此雙方留意，對公衆衛生，不無小補。（編者）</p>

<h3>關於調整房屋問題　請市府規定辦法解除民困</h3>
<p>編輯先生：一個橫在面前很嚴重亟待要解次的社會問題，就是增加房租，二房東與三房客應加調整一事，現在市府不是規定增加房租照廿六年增加四十倍嗎？但是現在大房東向二房東加租是以僞鈔金額變爲法幣金額二房東向三房客加租，當然也是以僞幣變爲法幣，從表面上看來，似乎很公允，但是二房東向大房東租進房屋的時候，房租當然很小，增加起來也很有限，二房東分租與三房客，房租一加再加，已經很大，（尤其是戰事以後租進的三房客）如照四十倍增加，已無力担負，倘以僞鈔變爲法幣，試問如何吃得消？，譬二房東將房屋分租與人，每月租金一千四百元，現在要改爲法幣一千四百元，二房東向大房東增加少數房金而向三房客同樣增加，可以坐收漁利，此事有關全市數百萬市民居住問題，異常嚴重，雖然報紙每天有不少不平待呼籲，但未見市政當局予以調整，畏此以往，房租糾紛，勢必愈鬧愈烈我是已經嘗到這滋味了，敢請貴報仗義執言，爲民請命，督促市政府速予調整：（一）重申前令嚴禁以僞幣變法幣爲加租標準，（二）二房東增加房租，應分戰前與戰後酌量增加，不能一概而論，（三）從速規定二房東與三房客加租標準，（四）調整以後，三房客如有已付逾額之租金，應在房租內扣除。上列種種，如蒙市府採納，則本市房屋糾紛，自可減少，全市三房客之痛苦，可以解除，眞是功德不淺了。　孫孝竹謹上</p>

<h3>The Mountain City is Sunny and Full of Light: The Three-Person Talks Proceed Smoothly; A Second Meeting is Scheduled for Today</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Chongqing Office, 7th] Marshall, Zhang Qun, and Zhou Enlai held the first meeting of their three-person committee at Yiyuan at 10:00 this morning, lasting three hours.

He got out of the car, nodded to the reporters, and entered the reception room inside the garden. Zhou Enlai was dressed in a blue uniform, while Zhang Qun wore a Zhongshan suit to the meeting.

Member Lu Dingyi stated that meeting news should be broadcast by the Central News Agency, as it is the only national news agency.

A communiqué should be issued daily. Member Shao Lizi first expressed his agreement with Member Liang's point that the meeting should have a harmonious spirit, and explained other points of view.

Member Zhou Enlai said that the Political Consultative Conference is being held for the first time, and he hopes that it will continue to be held when necessary in the future. If the meeting cannot be completed in two weeks, it should be extended to allow for lengthy discussions. Zhou then presented the Communist Party's views on the agenda, stating: (1) The issue of stopping military conflicts is being discussed by the government and CCP representatives and General Marshall in a three-person meeting, and it is hoped that a ceasefire order will be issued in the shortest possible time. The results of the three-person discussion will be reported to the meeting for discussion of ways to permanently eliminate the civil war. (2) The government and CCP talks will also be reported to the meeting. (3) A peaceful nation-building plan. (4) National Assembly Secretariat issues: we hope that all parties will recommend secretaries to participate in the secretariat to assist in political affairs such as the release of communiqués, etc. We nominate Qi Yanming to participate. Regarding publicity, since the meeting has allowed news reporters to attend as observers, all newspapers can freely report, and we hope that the Central News Agency will serve the Political Consultative Conference so that all parties' opinions can be issued through the Central News Agency quickly and accurately. He believed that the time for each meeting should not be too long, and the method of off-site consultation is also necessary, and he said: he believes that the Political Consultative Conference should have results.

Finally, Member Shao Lizi especially hoped for the success of the meeting, and expressed his apologies for those who requested to participate in the meeting or request to attend as observers, but could not get their wish. Shao also said: it is because of the limitations of the meeting venue and other issues, not because of disrespecting their opinions, and he hopes that all parties understand. By 5:00 p.m., the chairman made a conclusion and announced the adjournment.</p>

<h3>National Army Flies to Changchun in Succession; The Entire Division of the First Batch of Security Forces Will Be Transported Within Three Weeks, Responsible for Guarding and Assisting in Takeover Work</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from Our Beiping Office, 6th] It is known that the troops airlifted from Beiping to Changchun beginning on the 5th are the Second Northeast Security Force, reorganized from the puppet Manchukuo army. The first batch of 217 officers and soldiers, led by Deputy Commander Wu Yaozong, flew to Changchun on ten transport planes. Another 250 officers and soldiers took off today. It is estimated that the unit will be transported within three weeks. Commander Liu Depu is scheduled to fly there next week. It is reported that after the unit arrives, in addition to a part being responsible for the guard of Changchun, the rest will be assigned to various provincial governments to assist in the takeover work. Today, Commander Liu told this reporter that the unit has excellent qualities. University graduates account for 5%, middle school graduates account for 40%, and higher elementary school graduates account for 50%. The equipment of firearms is also very good. For several years, the unit has been in close contact with the central government. After Japan surrendered, it first entered the Kailuan mining area from its station in Zhenzi Town to accelerate industrial and mining production. On September 26, it was ordered to be reorganized into its current number, with a full European compilation, roughly equivalent to a division. There is a cavalry regiment that has entered Rehe with General Du Yuming, and the remaining three infantry regiments are being airlifted one after another. Before Japan surrendered, the unit was stationed in Luanxian. Now that the national humiliation has been avenged and they have returned to their homeland, all officers and soldiers are overjoyed. Commander Liu, a native of Shenyang, graduated from the 10th class of the Northeast Lecture Hall.</p>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] A broadcast from San Francisco on the 7th stated that Chiang Ching-kuo, President Chiang's personal representative, is currently on his way back to Chongqing from Moscow and will report to President Chiang on the results of his negotiations with the Soviets. It is reported that this negotiation was very smooth for China to take over the Northeast. Chinese troops can be airlifted to Harbin, and Chinese troops in South China can be transported to the Northeast by sea.</p>
<p>[United Press Dispatch from Beiping, 7th] In the past two days, more than 1,000 national troops have been transferred from Beiping to Changchun. In addition, Commissioner Chiang Ching-kuo has returned from Moscow and reported on the trip, so the national army in the Northeast is becoming active again. New C-47 type transport planes carried 400 members of the Northeast Camp Security Team to Changchun on the 5th and transported them again on the 6th, where the weather is 20 degrees below zero. When the national army entered the city, civilians lined the streets to welcome them. The airlift continued today, still carrying 400 people. For three weeks, U.S. special aircraft have been equipped and airlifted to Beiping to provide cold weather protection, but each plane is still afraid to spend the night at the airport for fear of freezing.</p>
<h3>Rehe Takeover is Extremely Smooth; Advancing on Both North and South Routes</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Dispatch from Jinzhou, 7th] The takeover of Rehe is extremely smooth. The Northern Route National Army has advanced from Yixian and Fuxin to the vicinity of Jianping. The Southern Route National Army also advanced to the vicinity of Lingyuan today. The defense of the two places can be completed within one or two days.</p>
<p>[United Press, with Troops in Rehe, 6th] General Du Yuming's troops did not fire a shot in Rehe Province, and successively recaptured the coal mining center of Beipiao and the important railway and highway town of Chaoyang from the Communist army. Thus, in the past 48 hours, it has completely occupied the so-called "Saar region of the Northeast." Trains have resumed running between Beipiao and Jinzhou. It is reported that the Rehe Provincial Government will move to Chaoyang as soon as possible. Beipiao is located 20 miles inside the border of Rehe Province, along the Jinzhou-Chaoyang Railway. Chaoyang is southwest of Beipiao, 22 miles from the Rehe-Liaoning border. The National Army occupied these two cities successively after retaking Fuxin at the beginning of last week. The area has a population of 130,000 and was expanded by the Japanese army during the war to become the largest coal production center in the Northeast, with an annual output of nearly 5 million tons. During the Japanese occupation, Beipiao alone produced more than 100 tons of coal annually. Fuxin and Beipiao are located at the two ends of a 75-mile coal bed in Rehe Province. Du's 13th Army is pressing tightly on Chengde, the provincial capital, from the east, and the 92nd Army is advancing from the Beiping area in the west, so Chengde is under pressure from both sides. General Du and Liu Duoquan, Chairman of Rehe Province, went to Fuxin for inspection on Friday. On the same day, the National Army entered the city of Beipiao. On Saturday, the National Army recaptured Chaoyang, 60 miles northeast of Jinzhou. After the Soviet army withdrew a month ago, the entire province of Rehe was heavily fortified by the Communist army, which was forced to retreat at the last minute when Du Yuming's army penetrated the southern part of Rehe via Fuxin. In Fuxin, through the interpreter, the reporter chatted with the local villagers and learned that the Communist army had withdrawn half an hour before the National Army arrived. I (the reporter referring to himself) am the first American correspondent to enter Rehe in recent years, and I accompanied General Du Yuming to inspect the front-line troops north of Fuxin.</p>
<p>Soldiers Guard the Border in the Cold at Fifteen Degrees Below Zero</p>
<p>In a temperature of fifteen degrees below zero on the Fahrenheit scale, I personally saw soldiers sitting behind the wall at the muzzle of the cannon, obviously trying to warm themselves. The severe cold of the weather, even with leather gloves and winter uniforms, seemed to be of little help. They held rifles in their hands and stomped their feet constantly, wiping the snot from their noses with their sleeves. I took General Du's special car to Fuxin, led by a hundred guards in armored trains. The engines of the jeeps and trucks never stopped throughout the journey to prevent freezing. The train heads and carriages were filled with water heaters, and we could hardly see anything from the windows. The officers and soldiers constantly drank tea and warmed themselves in the car. On the way, the car passed over two temporary bridges, and the original bridges on both sides had been blown up by the Communist army.</p>
<p>Only Two Caves Can Be Used in the Saar Region of Northeast China</p>
<p>Among those who accompanied General Du to Fuxin and Beipiao were several coal mine experts. When inspecting the Fuxin Coal Mine, the so-called Saar region of the Northeast, after its recovery, it was found that only two of the eight mine caves were still usable. These two caves belong to the local excavation type. The remaining six caves are deep underground, and it is estimated that it will take about a year to repair them before production can be restored. In the past few days, central coal mine experts have conducted a detailed study based on the records of Chinese workers and Japanese managers. They declared that the major machinery had been dismantled by the Soviets, and the smaller equipment had also been removed by the Communist army. The pumps in all six holes were dismantled, and the entire interior was flooded. I saw miners working hard at zero degrees in the other two holes, producing 500 tons of coal per day; but during the Japanese occupation, 14,000 tons of coal could be produced per day. It is reported that during the one month of Communist army occupation, a total of 300 tons of coal were produced per day. During the two months of Soviet army occupation, the miners were afraid and fled, and production completely stopped. At the same time, the Soviet army was not interested in this, and all the Soviet army wanted was to dismantle the heavy machinery.</p>
<h3>Three Guangzhou Traitors Will Be Publicly Tried Separately</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from Our Guangzhou Office, 6th] The High Court has decided to publicly try Chen Hongci, the puppet High Court President and Chief of the Pacification Office's Military Law Office, on the 20th; Li Chaoqun, the traitor, on the 8th; and Wang Yingru, the puppet Minister of Civil Affairs, on the 9th. The three major traitors will be allowed to hire lawyers to defend them and the public will be allowed to attend the trials, but the lawyers here believe that traitors are enemies of the people and are unwilling to appear in court to defend them. The court believes that lawyers should defend the defendants and will appoint lawyers to defend them, and will not allow them to refuse.</p>
<h3>Changchun Citizens Console the National Army; The Camp Group Has Entered Shenyang; Administrative Personnel Leave the Border on Two Routes</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Dispatch from Changchun, 6th] The news that the Northeast Security Team has been airlifted to Changchun has spread throughout the city, and all walks of life have sent condolences and are preparing to hold a consolation conference. Some of the consolation items were completed one or two months ago. In addition, most of the Soviet guards guarding the Xingying organs have been withdrawn today and replaced by our newly arrived security team.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] Another group of officers and soldiers from the Northeast Security Force flew here from Ping today. They were transported on ten planes, and another two planes carried Peng Jiqun, Chairman of Nenjiang Province, and Commissioner Liang Zhongquan, together with a group of 38 personnel from Jilin, Liaobei, and Songjiang Provinces.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Dispatch from Shenyang, 6th] The Northeast Security Commander-in-Chief Department's Camp Group, which was originally scheduled to enter Shenyang from Xinmin last night, arrived by car at 9:00 a.m. this morning due to traffic conditions. When the reporter arrived and the Chang car drove into the city, the people along the way gave General Peng Bisheng enthusiastic cheers, and the cheers for the accompanying guard troops were especially enthusiastic. The clothing and actions of the guards were very noticeable. Mayor Dong Wenqi and Soviet Deputy Commander of the City Defense Arloxing were also at the station to welcome them.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Dispatch from Beiping, 7th] The troops airlifted from Ping to the Northeast, starting on the 5th, have been proceeding smoothly due to the good weather in recent days. Officials from various provincial governments and takeover personnel in the northeast have also been airlifted out of the pass in large numbers in recent days. In addition to the chairmen of Songjiang and Nenjiang provinces, and important personnel who have been airlifted to Changchun in the past two days, Zheng Daoru, chairman of Jilin Province, is currently ill and unable to start. Deputy Chairman Wang Ninghua is temporarily acting as chairman, and led a secretary general Mao Tuoqing, and 20 others to fly to Changchun from Ping on the morning of the 7th. Personnel from the departments of economics, transportation, telecommunications, and postal services are waiting for a flight and can travel within days. Administrative personnel in Beiping from the Northeast are leaving the border by air and land on two routes, and it will take ten days to complete the transportation. The Northeast Camp and key personnel from various provinces have been working day and night to plan the takeover.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Dispatch from Shenyang, 5th] At 10:00 a.m. today, Mo Dehui went to the municipal government and police station to give instructions. He was warmly welcomed by the municipal government along the way. Mo originally went to the citizens by car, but the crowd was crowded and the road was blocked, so he got out of the car and walked. The voices of "Long live the Republic of China" and "Long live President Chiang" were endless, forming a craze. At 3:00 p.m., Mo went to the old provincial government to attend a welcome meeting from all walks of life, and everyone cried out in pain when he talked about the tragedy of the northeast in the past fourteen years. After the meeting, Mo returned to his residence and encountered a row of students from Changli Xu, cheering in unison. Mo is scheduled to hold a rally to comfort the citizens in the city hall on the 6th.</p>
<h3>Chennault Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shanghai] General Chennault, the number one hero of the Flying Tigers and former commander of the Fourteenth Air Force, returned to China on his special C54 Skymaster transport plane on the evening of the 6th, five months after leaving the country. Among those who welcomed him at the airport were General Weidner and Mayor Qian Dajun. That evening, he also attended Mayor Qian's reception. Chennault traveled from San Francisco to Shanghai via Manila, taking only three and a half days. Chennault's demeanor remained unchanged, still wearing his military uniform and retaining his original Air Force Major General rank, but he did not bring any attendants. Chennault mentioned that he had lost four pounds during his five-month stay in the United States, which he considered regrettable. Yesterday, Chennault met with various U.S. military generals here, and many of his Chinese friends also visited him. Chennault has taken up residence in an apartment here. A reporter visited him last night and he said that he hoped to go to Chongqing as soon as possible to meet with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and his wife, and also hoped to return to his old residence in Kunming for a short rest. He deeply felt honored to have cooperated with the Chinese Air Force to fight against the Japanese invaders during the war.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Reconstruction of Our Navy</h3>
<p>According to recent news reports, the Naval Headquarters has been ordered to be abolished, and the Ministry of Military Administration has sent the Director of the Naval Affairs Department to Shanghai to take over. At the same time, it was reported that Admiral Chen Shaokuan, the Commander-in-Chief of the Navy, has resigned. As the great task of national construction is being actively promoted, and the primary task of national construction lies in building up the military, this adjustment in national defense and military affairs is indeed a significant measure.</p>
<p>First of all, we must point out that in our efforts to build up the military, the importance of the navy cannot be ignored. Although China is a continental country, we have a long coastline and the islands of Taiwan and Hainan, making us the only major power on the west coast of the Pacific Ocean. To defend our coast and to protect Taiwan and Hainan, we must attach importance to the navy in our efforts to build up the military. Because we did not have a sufficient navy in the past, we were unable to resist the Japanese pirates' land and sea invasions. In our great task of national construction, we should actively build up the navy. However, there are several important issues in the reconstruction of our navy. First, the organizational problem of building the military; second, the naval policy problem. In addition to these, there are many problems surrounding the building of the military, such as the industrial and technical problems of building the military, the problem of talent or personnel, etc. However, compared with the organizational and policy problems, the problems of industry and personnel are secondary.</p>
<p>Some people may say that this is the age of atomic energy, and it seems unnecessary to rebuild the navy, which is somewhat mistaken. The navy has both passive and active significance in national defense. In terms of passivity, the navy is sufficient to prevent aggression. Nazi Germany's failure to cross the English Channel and invade Britain should be attributed to the British Navy. Control of the sea is extremely important from a national defense point of view. In terms of activity, the best defense is offense, and without a navy, one cannot take the offensive. The defeat of the Japanese invaders was mainly due to the US Navy. Without the navy led by Admiral Nimitz, how could they have occupied Iwo Jima and taken Okinawa? The Normandy landings also relied on the superiority of the Allied navies. The navy was a very important factor in defeating the Axis powers. The Second World War reconfirmed the importance of the navy. Therefore, the navy cannot be ignored in our efforts to build up the military.</p>
<p>However, in our efforts to build up the military, we also need a strong organization. The dual organizational system of the army and navy is no longer in line with the current use of national defense. This dual organization really needs to be reorganized. The United States originally had an independent Department of the Navy, but far-sighted people, in order to cope with future situations, advocated abolishing it after the First World War and combining the army and navy to form a single combat department or military department centered on national defense. Unfortunately, this plan was opposed and failed to be realized. Based on the experience of the Second World War, U.S. President Truman recently submitted a bill to Congress proposing to merge the army and navy departments into a single Department of National Defense. The introduction of this bill is due to the painful experience of the Second World War and has been widely praised. China has been committed to the construction of the navy for more than 50 years, but has not achieved any success. Although the reasons for this are not simple, the navy's independent system is also an obstacle. Now that our country is actively building up the military, the adjustment of military organization is a matter of urgency. We believe that the establishment of a naval affairs department in the Ministry of Military Administration is a necessary condition for unifying military power. Judging from recent international trends, it is a wise step. However, the tasks of the army and navy are different, and under the unified military power, each should have its own responsibilities and perform its duties separately. It would be incompetent to have army officers take on naval duties. What we need to strive for is to create a new tradition for our navy under the unified military power, rather than creating the army's navalization.</p>
<p>In addition, the unification of military power refers to the army, navy, and air force. In the United States, the air force is attached to the army system, while the United Kingdom has an independent air force. U.S. President Truman's proposal is to combine the army, navy, and air force into a single military department, with three departments for the army, navy, and air force. This plan is enough for us to learn from in building up the military. China's air force is still in the stage of growth, and the construction of the air force must be planned in conjunction with the construction of the army and navy. The Ministry of Military Administration, as its name suggests, takes the entire country's armed forces as its object. We approve of the measure of placing the navy under the control of the Ministry of Military Administration, and we also hope that the Chinese air force will not form its own system, and should also be transferred to the Ministry of Military Administration for deployment under the call for unified military power. Only in this way can our country's military construction have a sound organizational foundation.</p>
<p>As for policy, what kind of navy do we need? It is also worth studying. Building a navy requires an industrial base and cannot be achieved immediately. During the First World War, the Japanese Navy was still mainly building ships abroad; this was more than 30 years away from its active construction of the navy, which shows that naval construction is not easy. The main object of China's navy reconstruction should be to defend the country, it should be defensive rather than aggressive. Therefore, the focus of China's navy reconstruction is not on battleships, but on cruisers, aircraft carriers, destroyers, and even submarines. The task of the Chinese navy is not to control the open sea, but to protect the coastal waters. Our ally on the other side of the Pacific Ocean has the task of making the Pacific Ocean forever peaceful, and the task of the Chinese navy is to assist this task on the west coast of the Pacific Ocean. To fulfill this task, we need at least one million tons of warships, and we need a large number of naval personnel. China's naval construction has not fully begun, and we must create an excellent tradition for the Chinese navy. Due to the adjustment of the military structure, we hope that China's new navy can be truly rebuilt.</p>

<h3>UN General Assembly to Open, Beal Flies to London, Following Moscow Conference to Resolve Various Issues</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 7th] Secretary of State Beal left for London today to attend the United Nations General Assembly and resolve outstanding issues from the Moscow Conference. Beal's objectives include the following: (1) Establishing an international agreement on the Dardanelles Strait issue to ease Soviet-Turkish relations. (2) Agreeing to organize a joint Anglo-American-Soviet committee to study the complex issue of oil-rich Iran. (3) The UK and the Soviet Union guaranteeing "full security" assurances for the activities of the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 5th Dispatch] Most of our delegates attending the United Nations General Assembly will arrive in London on the 8th and 9th. Qian Tai is expected to arrive on the 8th, and Chuan Bingchang will arrive on the 9th. Zhang Jun left Calcutta on the 3rd and is expected to arrive early next week. If Minister Wang Shijie cannot attend due to official duties, Gu Weijun will serve as the acting chief representative.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 5th Dispatch] The Queen Elizabeth arrived in Southampton this morning, carrying more than 160 representatives from the Americas to attend the United Nations General Assembly. Representatives from most countries have already arrived in the UK. The most popular of the U.S. representatives, apart from Beal, who arrived by boat, was the late President Roosevelt.</p>
<h3>General Assembly Agenda Focuses on Atomic Energy</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 7th] Representatives from the 51 member states of the United Nations will meet this week to seek the permanent peace that mankind dreams of and hopes for, with the atomic bomb being the most important topic in their minds. Although London has been bombed by enemy planes, the United Nations General Assembly is scheduled to open on the 10th in an atmosphere of hope to complete the unfinished business of the League of Nations. The plan to control atomic energy, recently agreed upon by the three foreign ministers, may be reviewed by the major powers at the General Assembly. Before the United Nations machinery begins to work, the representatives must consider the following points: (1) Electing six non-permanent members to the Security Council to cooperate with the five most powerful countries (China, the United States, the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, and France) in the committee. The election of non-permanent members should be based on geographical distribution. (2) Electing the Secretary-General, with the Ambassador to the United States, Bia Sun, as the top candidate. In addition, Marshal Eisenhower, former British Foreign Secretary Eden, and the Norwegian Foreign Minister have also been rumored. (3) Establishing a military committee, whose first task is to guide the Security Council on the military quotas that each country should contribute. (4) Trusteeship issues are expected to be raised early in the General Assembly. Some representatives in the Preparatory Committee already have a tendency to suspect that the trusteeship governments will delay the action of replacing the mandate system with the trusteeship system.</p>
<h3>United Nations Organization is the Cornerstone of Peace</h3>
<p>[United Press, New York, 6th] The New York Times cautiously evaluated the recent Moscow Conference of the Three Foreign Ministers for two weeks before concluding that the agreements reached at the conference, along with the United Nations organization, have become the two pillars of permanent peace. Both pillars show the world that the war in Europe and Asia was a war for the United Nations, and therefore all should participate in seeking peace. [Associated Press] The newspaper also expressed a hope for the departure of the U.S. representatives to attend the United Nations General Assembly in London, believing that the painful lessons learned in the past twenty-five years have not been wasted, and that the new United Nations organization and General Assembly will take swift and decisive action to seek reconciliation and progress. The newspaper said: Although the League of Nations was not successful, it did have its important goals, and its organization worked in the center of the continent where countries were competing with each other. If the United States had joined the League, and if the League members had taken small risks to avoid big disasters and taken decisive measures against aggressor countries, the League of Nations would have had a better chance of success. The newspaper concluded: The United Nations organization is now ready to take over the research and specialized departments of the League of Nations, including the library and archives. The new International Court of Justice is actually a continuation of the League of Nations International Court of Justice. "We can say that the League of Nations has not disappeared, but will be resurrected from the ashes."</p>

<h3>Amidst the Disturbances in the Dutch East Indies, U.S. Troops Withdraw from Southeast Asia, All Parties Consider This Move of Great Significance</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 7th] U.S. Secretary of State Beal announced last night that the United States was disengaging from the Mountbatten Joint Command in Southeast Asia. Because the British and Dutch troops attacked the Javanese independence army, which caused private controversy for several weeks, the United States can now follow an independent political path in the turbulent Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 6th] The Southeast Asia United Nations Staff Corps issued a notice at midnight today, stating: "The U.S. military's mission in the India-Burma theater has been completed. The United States has no need to participate in the disarmament of the Japanese army and the restoration of the political situation in the territory under the Southeast Asia Command. Therefore, the United Nations Staff Corps believes that from a military point of view, Admiral Mountbatten does not need to retain the Anglo-American Joint Command. The U.S. representatives will be limited to theater liaison in the future." At a time when the Dutch East Indies are in turmoil, with British and Dutch troops in Java fighting the East Indian independence army, all parties believe that this move has great significance.</p>
<h3>U.S. President Urges People to Help with the Clothing Drive</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 6th] President Truman today called on the nation to help the "Victory Clothing Donation Drive" to aid hundreds of millions of people worldwide who have suffered from the ravages of war. The President's call said, "More than 300 million people in disaster-stricken countries around the world are paying the price of victory this winter with hunger, cold, poverty, and disease. Americans donated old clothes in the spring, allowing 25 million men, women, and children in Europe, China, and the Philippines to stay warm, which is the starting point for relief and rehabilitation this winter. To further enable those who are less fortunate than ourselves to share our surplus, we are now collecting victory clothes, so as to express our gratitude to the Almighty God for enabling us to win victory at a great price."</p>
<h3>Investigation of Pearl Harbor Incident May Reach Two Conclusions</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 5th Dispatch] The U.S. Congressional Pearl Harbor Incident Investigation Committee has completed two-thirds of its work since hearing reports on November 15 last year. The committee has now adjourned. To date, 60 witnesses have testified, and the report records have reached one million words. There are other witnesses, including General Short (Army) and Admiral Kimmel (Navy), who are directly related to the Pearl Harbor incident, who will continue to speak, so it will still take some time before responsibility can be determined. The New York Times wrote an article today reviewing the investigation of the Pearl Harbor incident, stating that it may reach two conclusions: (1) The late President Roosevelt did not lead the United States into war, and (2) the jealousy and infighting between the U.S. Army and Navy should bear part of the responsibility for the Pearl Harbor tragedy.</p>
<h3>Our Prosecutors to Fly to Tokyo</h3>

<h3>U.S. State Department to Strengthen International News Service Work</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 6th] The State Department today issued a statement on the report submitted by Dr. McClymont regarding the establishment of the U.S. International News Service. The statement said: Modern international relations belong to the people of all countries, not just the governments. Therefore, open information activities have become an integral part of the guidance of foreign policy. If the people of other countries do not understand the background of our foreign policy, then the various policies cannot be clearly understood and accepted. The U.S. government has long been aware of this. Dr. McClymont argues that the government should not wage a news war with the people. In peacetime, the United States needs a news service that covers the globe. The report submitted by Mr. McClymont has ten points for future work, such as strengthening news releases, assisting journalists, publishing publications, assisting the foreign publishing industry, exhibiting photos, lending radio broadcasts, and showing films about the United States.</p>
<h3>Japanese Emperor's Horse</h3>

<h3>Shidehara Still Has Lingering Intentions to Cling to Power, the Cabinet Faces Numerous Difficulties, Dispatch Foreign Minister Yoshida to Meet MacArthur for Instructions, the Date of the Japanese General Election Will Be Decided by MacArthur</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Tokyo, 7th Dispatch] The Japanese political situation is currently in a precarious and uneasy situation. The fate of the Shidehara Cabinet will probably be decided within a day or two. During yesterday's cabinet discussion, the question of whether the cabinet should resign en masse was left to Shidehara to handle. Today, this newspaper's reporter went to the gate of the Prime Minister's official residence and saw government personnel going in and out, very busy, and their flustered state was revealed in their expressions. Shidehara has not yet gotten out of bed due to illness, but he is in contact with various parties today, continuously discussing how to implement MacArthur's instructions. It is generally believed that the Shidehara Cabinet may fall within a day or two, but Shidehara himself clearly still has lingering intentions to cling to power. It is said that he notified the cabinet members yesterday to continue to serve. The Social Democratic Party publicly criticized the Shidehara Cabinet today, demanding the resignation of the entire government, but general public opinion and political parties have not yet made explicit statements. At the same time, Shidehara has ordered Foreign Minister Yoshida to meet MacArthur to ask for instructions on the question of the cabinet's advance and retreat, and hopes that MacArthur can take into account the difficulties of the cabinet members and enable the cabinet to remain standing. As of this afternoon, Yoshida has not yet met MacArthur. All parties believe that the actual action of a partial reorganization or general resignation of the Japanese cabinet will be taken after Yoshida meets MacArthur. As for the future, the entire political situation in Japan will be greatly reformed under the influence of MacArthur's decisions. Both the political circles and the parliament today believe that the cabinet crisis is becoming more acute, and that the members of the House of Representatives and the House of Councillors, political party figures, and local personnel who are aggressors will also be on the list of those to be purged, because the purpose of MacArthur's order is to guide Japanese politics onto the road to democratization. According to reliable sources, it is clear that Shidehara's intention is to remove the cabinet members who have been accused of being aggressors, and then carry out political and economic reforms in accordance with the instructions to overcome the current difficulties. However, the outcome will depend entirely on MacArthur's decision.</p>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 7th] Kyodo News Agency speculated today that the Japanese general election will be held around mid-February. According to the Allied Headquarters, the official date will be decided and announced by the Allied Headquarters as soon as MacArthur's instructions have cleared out the Japanese aggressors and guaranteed the people's freedom to vote. The Japanese cabinet originally planned to hold a general election in January, but it was postponed by the Allied Headquarters' instructions. However, the cabinet still hopes to hold the election as soon as possible so that it can submit the budget and other important matters to the special parliament convened after the re-election.</p>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 7th] MacArthur recently issued an instruction to purge Japanese aggressors, and today the Communist Party followed suit, demanding the elimination of Japanese women war criminals. According to Maki, the director of the party's women's department, the Communist Party has prepared a list of women war criminals and is currently compiling a second list, which includes female educators, female writers, officials of the Women's Division of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association, and officials of the Japanese Women's Association supported by the government. In addition, there is a female factory foreman who strictly controlled the female workers and punished those who did not obey.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Tokyo, 7th] Jiji Press reported that, according to well-informed sources close to the cabinet, the Imperial Guard Headquarters will also be thoroughly reorganized under the influence of General MacArthur's instructions, because most of the officers and soldiers of the Guard were former officers and soldiers of the Imperial Guard Division.</p>
<h3>US, UK and Soviet Union announce recognition of Austrian government</h3>

<h3>Gandhi Re-Advocates Using Disobedience as a Weapon to Fight for Indian Liberation; Nehru Advocates Organizing a Federation; British Delegation Received Reporters Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Calcutta, 7th] Gandhi, who has been out of politics for six months, made a statement yesterday, claiming that he will use disobedience as a weapon to achieve India's goals. Disobedience is the strength of the Indian people. The entire nation is unwilling to obey British aspirations and is prepared to endure the consequences of this. Ultimately, it will inevitably cause the institutions of imperialism to grind to a halt.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Bombay, 7th] Nehru, leader of the Congress Party, said in a speech today at an election meeting in Sukkur, Sindh province, that he hopes India, Burma, Malaya, Ceylon, Iran, and Afghanistan can form a federation. The plan to partition India would create a permanent life of slavery. Even if the British government and the Muslim League agree to partition India, the opposition of the Hindu and Sikh communities will ensure that it cannot become a reality. After the British withdraw from India, the question of India's political system can be resolved. Nehru added that the plan to partition India goes against the spirit of the times.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, New Delhi, 6th] After arriving in New Delhi this afternoon, the British Parliamentary delegation held its first press conference, reiterating that the delegation is in India to conduct thorough research and will inquire about all matters related to the Indian issue. Professor Lees-Smith, head of the delegation, said, "We are not here to lecture, nor are we representatives of the government. We have not been instructed to make any report; we are purely independent representatives." Sorenson, a member of parliament who is most loved by Indians for his sympathy for India, said, "We are here to learn, so we must sincerely tell you that we have absolute freedom to express our opinions." Richards stated that the delegation's plans have not yet been decided. It is said that Jinnah, chairman of the Indian Muslim League, will be the first Indian leader to meet with the delegation; he is currently in New Delhi.</p>

<h3>Local Dispatches</h3>
<p>Songjiang</p>
<p>Report on the Collapse of the Seawall Submitted to the Provincial Government: This county previously reported the collapse of the seawall and requested an on-site inspection for emergency repairs. County Magistrate Huang not only submitted a report to the provincial authorities but also dispatched technical assistant Xu Zhenxing and others to inspect the Jinshanzui area. According to the investigation, the most severe damage was found along the 3rd, 4th, and 5th "baos" (sections) of Jinshanzui Township. The total length of damage reached 1,220 meters, with some breaches as wide as 37 meters. In the event of a strong gale or large wave, these areas are in danger of being washed away. Therefore, detailed charts and tables have been prepared and submitted to the provincial government for approval.</p>
<p>Letter to County Government Requesting Speedy Establishment of Vagrant Training Centers: Vagrants and beggar children are increasingly prevalent in urban and rural areas. These people have been corrupted by the Japanese enemy and have mostly become addicted to drugs and other vices. Therefore, the Winter Defense Office proposed at a joint meeting of all sectors to establish centers to accommodate them and provide relief. It was resolved that the county government should be requested to quickly establish vagrant training centers and beggar children's education centers. In addition to allocating funds from the existing vagrant training centers, a letter was sent to the managers of the Fude Benevolent Hall to request that all of the hall's land rent revenue be transferred to this purpose.</p>
<p>Hangzhou</p>
<p>Municipal Expansion: Departments to be Reorganized into Bureaus: To expand municipal administration, the Hangzhou Municipal Government has decided to reorganize the Public Works, Health, and Education Departments into bureaus. The personnel selections have been announced: (1) Shen Jingchu as Director of the Public Works Bureau, (2) Zhang Xinpei as Director of the Health Bureau, and (3) Zhong Boyong as Director of the Education Bureau. All have arrived in Hangzhou, and the bureaus will be formally established within days. It is also planned to recruit various technical experts to assist in the advancement of municipal affairs.

<p>Kunshan</p>
<p>Relief Association Prepares for Winter Relief: The Kunshan Relief Association has been established and convened its first committee meeting the other day. It was unanimously agreed that with the winter season approaching and the poor suffering from hunger and cold, immediate relief should be provided. It was decided to organize winter relief with a focus on providing porridge and clothing, to be implemented immediately.</p>
<p>Suzhou</p>
<p>Frequent Thefts in Four Rural Townships of This County: Theft has been rampant in the four rural townships and urban areas recently. There have been several robbery cases every day. Yesterday, Lishu reported a bandit alarm again, with more than 40 bandits holding weapons and robbing for two hours. The provincial government has instructed the Wu County government to pay close attention. In addition to strengthening defenses, the City Defense Command plans to cooperate with the police to establish an extensive intelligence network to prevent bandit activity. Zhang Shaohua, the head of the Second Water Police District, is preparing to conduct a large-scale suppression during the winter defense period to pacify the four townships.</p>
<p>Wuxi</p>
<p>County Government Arrests Traitorous Bandit District Chief: Mao Yunxiang, a villager near Nanmenhou Fangqian, served as the leader of the intelligence team of the puppet spy station and the secretary-general of the Yi Society during the enemy occupation. He privately set up checkpoints in the four townships, extorting travelers. With a large network of accomplices, he rejoined the traitorous bandits after the enemy's surrender, serving as the district chief of the suburban area, levying public grain and forcibly conscripting young villagers into the bandit ranks, poisoning the local area. Recently, he secretly went to Shanghai, which was discovered by County Magistrate Fan Tisheng, who immediately dispatched officers to Shanghai, arrested Mao Yunxiang, and also captured Lu Hefeng, deputy district chief of the traitorous bandit Meixi District, and Hui Xigen, leader of the Self-Defense Team, and three others. They were escorted back to the county for detention. After repeated interrogations, they confessed to their crimes. Commander Tang of the Third Front Army issued a special commendation to County Magistrate Fan yesterday for capturing the bandit leaders.</p>
<p>Evidence of Treason Submitted to the High Court: Thirty-three traitors from this county were sent to the Suzhou High Court two months ago. The outcome has been of great concern to all sectors. Because the county government did not attach evidence of the crimes of each of the accused, the High Court sent a letter requesting the county government to submit them for investigation. The county government then issued a public notice to the public, urging them to report crimes automatically. It is now known that the crimes of the 33 traitors, including Qin Lianggong, were partly reported by the people and partly substantiated by the Traitorous Crimes Investigation Committee. Yesterday, the county government sent all the evidence of the accused to the High Court Prosecutor's Office for review.</p>

<h3>Education in Taiwan Province After Takeover: The Teacher Problem</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taipei, 5th] Before the takeover of Taiwan Province, there was one university, Taipei Imperial University; five vocational schools; three normal schools; forty-five middle schools; twenty-seven industrial schools; ninety-two industrial supplementary schools; one thousand and ninety-nine national schools; and two schools for the blind and deaf. In terms of social education, there were ninety-four libraries, seven museums, sixty-eight shrines, twenty-three sports grounds, twenty-four swimming pools, one hundred and twenty-nine theaters, thirty theater troupes, and six industrial and commercial incentive halls.</p>
<p>Higher Education</p>
<p>In higher education, Taipei Imperial University has been largely taken over by personnel dispatched by the Ministry of Education and renamed National Taipei University. One public agricultural, industrial, and commercial vocational school has been taken over by the Provincial Department of Education and renamed Provincial Agricultural, Industrial, and Commercial Vocational School, and the principal has also been appointed. The original medical vocational school, which was attached to the university, has also been taken over by the Ministry of Education. The original private women's vocational school is currently suspended. In the future, provincial vocational schools will also admit female students, giving women the opportunity to receive higher education. During the Japanese rule, women had no opportunity to participate in Taiwanese higher education.</p>
<p>Secondary Education</p>
<p>In secondary education, the public middle schools in the Taipei city area have been directly taken over by the Department of Education. The public middle schools in the other states and halls are first taken over by the state and hall takeover committees. Taiwanese compatriots with better academic ability are temporarily selected from the education sector of each school or neighboring school to be appointed as acting principals and are responsible for the safekeeping of all equipment and property and continue to hold classes while waiting for personnel to be dispatched to take over. All public middle schools in the province have now been uniformly renamed provincial schools. In addition, there are six private middle schools and two private vocational schools that continue to operate.</p>
<p>National Education</p>
<p>In national education, the national schools in various regions have been taken over by the takeover committees of the various states and halls and reorganized. Principals are all Taiwanese, or Taiwanese are appointed as academic affairs directors to act as principals. In social education, the industrial supplementary schools in various regions have been taken over by the takeover committees of the various states and halls. The libraries, museums, and shrines in Taipei have been taken over by personnel dispatched by the Executive Governor's Office and the Department of Education. In the various states and halls, they have been taken over by personnel dispatched by the takeover committees of the various states and halls. Comparing the enrollment rates of Taiwanese and Japanese children in the former states and halls of Taiwan Province, the average number of Taiwanese male and female children was only 7,117, while the number of Japanese male and female children was nearly 9,962. The ratio of Japanese to the population of Taipei is one to ten, but the difference in the enrollment rate of children is even greater.</p>
<p>Teacher Problem</p>
<p>The current teacher shortage is a major problem. According to Zhao Nai, director of the Provincial Department of Education, personnel have been dispatched to Shanghai to recruit 300 teachers of Chinese and history and geography to serve in Taiwan. Starting next semester, Chinese language and history and geography education will occupy the most time in the curriculum. Other subjects will remain as they are for the time being. Textbooks have not yet been printed, which is also a pressing problem to be solved.</p>

Po Xiang said that most private schools are rented and landlords often use the expiration of the lease or the claim that they want to take back the property for their own use as an excuse to sue in court, forcing the schools to move. For the sake of education, he requested that the Legislative Yuan enact special regulations. Before the enactment of special laws and regulations, he requested the Housing Lease Committee of this city to supplement the lease regulations with provisions to protect school buildings to demonstrate the protection of education. After discussion, the following resolutions were made: (1) Elementary school tuition (including miscellaneous fees) should not exceed 12,000 yuan, and the amount of reduction or exemption should not be less than 15%. Junior high school tuition should not exceed 16,000 yuan, and the amount of reduction or exemption should not be less than 10%. Senior high school tuition should not exceed 20,000 yuan, and the amount of reduction or exemption should not be less than 10%. (2) Teachers' salaries, excluding housing rent, should not be less than 70% of net income. (3) Please request the City Education Bureau to discuss with relevant parties to open up the Racecourse and other public places and private vacant land for students to use for activities. (4) Negotiate with the Municipal Public Utility Bureau to establish preferential transportation arrangements for teachers and students. (5) Regarding the issue of protecting school buildings, Yu Chuanding, Mao Jiaju, and Xu Wenxiang were selected to represent all private schools to provide opinions to the Housing Lease Committee. (6) The start and end dates of the winter vacation should be in accordance with the Ministry's orders. (7) Special treatment should be required for the water and electricity used by schools. (8) Request that enemy and puppet materials, especially fabrics, be sold to private schools at affordable prices for making uniforms.</p>

<h3>Chengyou Cup Basketball Match Yesterday: Chengyou Defeated Desheng; Xiexing Easily Took Victory Over V Team</h3>

<h3>On the Collection of the Haiyuan Pavilion</h3>
<p>— Huang Heqing</p>
<p>Yesterday I read a Central News Agency dispatch from Tianjin in the newspapers, stating that the books from the Liyuan Pavilion in Liaocheng are now stored in Tianjin. President Song recently decided in Tianjin that the government should purchase them and hand them over to the Beiping Library for preservation. After investigation, there is only the Haiyuan Pavilion in Liaocheng, Shandong, and no Liyuan Pavilion. The Liyuan mentioned in the report must be a mistake for Haiyuan Pavilion. I am specially pointing out this correction and briefly introducing the Pavilion as follows:</p>
<p>The Haiyuan Pavilion was the pavilion of Yang Yizeng, who was one of the four great book collectors in the north and south during the Qing Dynasty. It had more than 460 old Song and Yuan editions and was known as "Nan Qu Bei Yang" with Qu's Iron Lute Bronze Sword Tower in Changshu. Although the collection of the Pavilion has been repeatedly damaged by war and lost a lot, the fine and famous publications are still moved around. It has long been coveted by Japan, who wanted to buy them at a high price and carry them away. At that time, the Shandong Provincial Government, upon learning of this news, ordered Wang Xiantang, the director of the Shandong Provincial Library, to negotiate the purchase by the government. However, the asking price was too high, and no agreement was reached. The Japanese purchase was also prevented by the government. However, a few precious books were still inevitably smuggled to Japan. The price of the books was astronomical at the time. According to what I know, Song editions were sold for 7,000 yuan, and Song editions of Liu Zongyuan's collection were sold for 10,000 yuan. Also, I heard a month ago that Yuan Tongli, the director of the National Beiping Library, was negotiating to buy the books from the Pavilion stored in Tianjin. The price of the books was estimated at 20 million yuan and has been approved by Minister Zhu of the Ministry of Education. Now that the Central News Agency has sent a telegram stating that President Song has decided to buy them, the matter is bound to go ahead. It is gratifying that these extremely valuable books of our predecessors will be preserved by the state under a special responsibility and will not be lost again in the future.</p>

<h3>Chen Guolian States: French Ship Smuggling War Criminals Case Is By No Means A Local Incident; French Consul General and Ship Captain Should Be Held Criminally Liable</h3>
<p>The "Baudin" Affair Must Not Be Considered A Local Incident; Our Side Is Currently Negotiating With The French Side In Chongqing, And The Ministry Of Foreign Affairs Has Lodged A Serious Protest With The French Embassy In China, Demanding That All The Conditions Put Forward By Our Side Be Immediately Fulfilled And That Similar Incidents Be Guaranteed Not To Happen Again.</p>
<p>Mr. Chen Guolian Severely Criticizes</p>
<p>Chen Guolian, Director of the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, refuted Consul General Ferey's point that the case was a local incident when he met with reporters yesterday, saying: This case must not be regarded as a local incident, but as the first major event that occurred after our country recovered extraterritoriality. The French side's actions are, in terms of sovereignty, an act of infringing upon our sovereignty, and in terms of law, the French Consul General and the captain of the "Baudin" are both criminally responsible. Since after the recovery of extraterritoriality, within Chinese territory, only the Shanghai Garrison Headquarters, the Police Bureau, the Gendarmerie Headquarters, and the judicial organs can arrest people; no one else has the right to arrest criminals. Therefore, the French side's arrest of criminals in Shanghai has violated the criminal code. The French side attempts to take advantage of the Shanghai people's decades-old traditional views and misperceptions of foreigners to create a fait accompli. Although this action does not affect the lives of the people, the impact on our national status is not insignificant, and the loss of sovereignty begins with this. Therefore, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will never regard this case as an ordinary local incident. To give an example, what would be the seriousness of the situation if a foreign warship were to take away senior personnel of our country's puppet organizations who were seeking refuge in that country's consulate in the future? In short, the citizens of our country after the victory should cultivate a new spirit, and foreign envoys should also have a new understanding of our country. In order to maintain the integrity of sovereignty and the dignity of the law, our country will have to take resolute and appropriate steps.</p>
<p>French Consul's Claims Are Totally Unfounded</p>
<p>The reporter further learned that the French Consul General claimed that he had not received a notice from the French Ambassador to China regarding the closure of the consular court, and that the French Consul General still held consular jurisdiction before the Sino-French New Treaty came into effect. According to the decree publicly announced by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, this cannot be established at all. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs had already informed the French Provisional Chargé d'Affaires in China, Peng Gu Er Zheng Che Sheng, on May 19, 1943, stating that "All concessions obtained by France in accordance with unequal treaties between China and France, the Peking Legation Quarter, the Shanghai International Settlement, and the Xiamen International Settlement, administrative power, consular jurisdiction, and other privileges, have been eliminated due to France's illegal actions (Note: At that time, the French side illegally violated international law by signing an agreement with the puppet organization to return the concessions), and the Chinese government is no longer bound by them." Furthermore, according to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' announcement on December 3, 1945, "The French Embassy has now agreed to immediately close its consular courts in China." On the 14th of the same month, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced again, "It has been found that the extraterritorial rights enjoyed by all countries in China have been abolished. Our courts should not recognize any country still exercising extraterritorial rights in our territory." Based on this, the French Consul General's claims cannot be a reason for his illegal arrest of criminals.</p>
<p>Our Ministry of Foreign Affairs Has Repeatedly Stated</p>
<p>In addition, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has repeatedly stated that we have the right to arrest and try any foreign personnel who collude with the enemy and endanger China and the Allied countries. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced on October 24, 1945: "Regarding the handling of foreign enemy-supporting elements in China, our military authorities have decided to arrest them and hand them over to the courts for trial. However, if the criminals have also committed crimes in the Allied-controlled areas and their cases are more serious, they will be handed over to the Allied forces for punishment." On December 22 of the same year, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs also ordered the Shanghai Office, stating: "In cities such as Shanghai, Tianjin, and Peiping, and other recovered areas, foreign personnel who have colluded with the enemy and endangered China and the Allied countries during the Japanese occupation period, we have the right to arrest and try them in accordance with the Sino-Foreign New Treaty. In addition to the Military Affairs Commission issuing orders to the Army Headquarters and the commanders of various war zones, the Ministry of Judicial Administration will also issue orders to courts at all levels to comply. It is hereby ordered to comply, and cooperate with local courts and relevant agencies." According to the above-mentioned publicly announced decree, the French Consul General's unauthorized arrest of people in this city, infringing on our sovereignty, cannot be easily dismissed.</p>
<h3>Enemy Spy Nakatani Has Been Arrested</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Nakatani, an enemy spy from the Shanghai Military Police, used to cruelly abuse American detainees and our underground workers during his time working at the enemy Military Police Headquarters on North Sichuan Road. After the victory, Nakatani, because he could speak fluent Chinese, still disguised himself as a Chinese citizen and lived in various parts of this city. The U.S. War Crimes Investigation Office had been investigating in many ways and recently discovered Nakatani mixed in with the Japanese concentration camp in West Shanghai. He was arrested and has now been escorted to Tilanqiao Prison, and will soon be submitted for trial as a war criminal.</p>
<h3>Western-Style Used Clothes For Relief Are Prohibited From Being Sold Or Exchanged; Mr. Liu Hongsheng Gave A Speech Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Liu Hongsheng, Director of the Shanghai Branch of the Executive Yuan's Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, answered questions from this newspaper's reporter yesterday, explaining the various rumors circulating recently. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Penicillin Cannot Be Sold Widely</p>
<p>Reporter asked: (1) A large number of Western-style used clothes distributed by the Administration to various charitable organizations are not suitable for refugees to wear and are not warm enough. It is said that the entire batch will be sold and Chinese-style cotton clothes will be purchased instead. Has the Administration heard of this? Answer: This batch of used clothes was donated by the people of the Allied countries for relief purposes and must not be sold in any way to prevent malpractice. Although Western suits may not be as warm, they are better than having no clothes at all. Therefore, until further orders are received from the headquarters, all sales or exchanges for other items are prohibited. This is the current position of the Administration. (2) Asked: Recently, penicillin has been rampant on the black market, while hospitals and pharmacies are extremely short of this drug. What are the remedies? Answer: The penicillin on the market at present is definitely not owned by the Administration, because not much of this drug has been transported here. Therefore, it cannot be distributed to various health agencies on a large scale. It can only be considered for distribution when certain diseases require it as a special medicine. If it is widely used for any minor illness, it is feared that the current stock will be exhausted in a few days. For overall planning, it is necessary to be cautious. Therefore, hospitals and pharmacies may not be able to widely put it on the market in the short term.</p>
<p>Organize Inspection Team To Provide Opinions</p>
<p>In addition, the Administration has specially dispatched inspectors He Fangli, technician Xie Zhangzhe, commissioner Lin Shigan, and four others to form an inspection team. They departed yesterday morning to inspect various charitable organizations, groups, and hospitals, and will put forward inspection opinions for improvement in the future.</p>
<h3>Tan Yulin Succeeds As Chief of Staff of the Garrison Department</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Wei Ruling, Chief of Staff of the Songhu Garrison Headquarters, was ordered to be transferred to Director of the Design Department of the Military Administration Department's Conscription Department.

<h3>Qian Dajun Encourages Subordinates To Develop A Clean And Honest Atmosphere</h3>
<p>Mayor Qian Dajun gave a speech to all the staff at the memorial week held by the municipal government yesterday morning, encouraging them with three things: Colleagues must absolutely eliminate corrupt behavior and cultivate a good atmosphere of clean and honest politics. Any unit should be closely supervised by the head officer and followed in unison. If any employee is found to have illegal behavior, once verified, they will be dealt with severely, and the head officer will be held jointly responsible. Secondly, regarding the issues of cleanliness and neatness, we should start with ourselves, invigorate our spirits, cultivate vitality, strictly observe time, handle official affairs, and strive for speed so that work efficiency can be improved.</p>
<h3>Guangdong Sojourners in Shanghai Rescue Yang Wendao</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Yang Wendao, who was wrongly imprisoned for ten years in the Nakayama Hideo case, has aroused sympathy from all walks of life since his son Hanzhi appealed for help. It is learned that the directors of the Guangdong Sojourners Association in Shanghai, Lao Jingshiu, Guo Lingshuang, and Xi Guansheng, etc., together with Feng Shaoshan and other responsible persons of the Guangzhao Public Hall, will convene a joint meeting in the coming days to discuss rescue measures. Tang Huai, the lawyer who defended Yang Wendao that year, told reporters that he had submitted a petition to the Supreme Court in Chongqing, urging for a trial. Ge Zhaoji, another lawyer who defended Yang, has now been reassigned as a commissioner of the Seafarers' Party Department, responsible for hosting the newly established Sea Responsibility Radio Station, and has been broadcasting appeals for Yang for days. Listeners have sent letters and telegrams one after another, expressing great concern, especially the Guangdong sojourners.</p>
<h3>Unblocking City Traffic and Expanding North-South Trunk Lines</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The Municipal Bureau of Public Works pays special attention to expanding the north-south traffic trunk lines for road construction. Before the war, the Shanghai International Settlement, the French Concession, and the city center each had their own traffic systems. For example, the International Settlement tried its best to develop westward, extending to roads built beyond the boundary, resulting in deformed development. Now, the Bureau of Public Works has started the project of widening Zhejiang Road, Jielu, and North Xizang Road, and the Henan Road project is also being planned. In the future, it is planned to integrate the city center, Zhabei, Huangpu District, and the entire Nanshi area, so that traffic in this city can be accessible in all directions.</p>
<p>In addition, the above-mentioned repaired road surfaces have been completed for more than 80,000 square meters, accounting for one-quarter of those that should be repaired.</p>
<h3>Enemy Warehouses and Weapons Are Inventoried by the Military Administration Department</h3>
<p>The Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau convened a meeting of responsible persons from the Customs, the Military Administration Department, and the Naval Office yesterday morning to hand over the army and navy equipment and weapons inventoried in various warehouses to the Military Administration Department and the Naval Office respectively.</p>
<p>In addition, the enemy warehouse previously received by the Naval Headquarters began to be transferred to the Customs for inventory on November 9 last year. It has been nearly two months since then, and about 150 warehouses have been inventoried. There are still 50 warehouses that are being inventoried, and it will take another three weeks to complete.</p>
<h3>Seven Thousand Japanese Prisoners of War Were Sent Back Yesterday</h3>
<p>Yesterday, another 7,000 Japanese prisoners of war were concentrated and inspected in the city center square in the morning, and in the afternoon, they were divided into the Japanese ship "Tatsumi Maru" and five U.S. landing ships to leave Shanghai. This is the seventh batch of Japanese prisoners of war being sent back.</p>
<h3>U.S. Soldiers Who Stole and Sold Military Supplies Will Be Tried</h3>
<p>The U.S. Army Headquarters Intelligence Department reported that 25 U.S. soldiers, including several officers, who stole and sold U.S. military supplies are now awaiting trial and punishment. The items they stole and sold included watches, cameras, instruments, clothing, food, medicine, cigarettes, etc., worth a huge US$50,000. They are now awaiting a verdict of imprisonment for five to ten years by the U.S. Military Tribunal.</p>
<h3>U.S. Soldier Who Caused Accident Was Detained Yesterday</h3>
<p>U.S. Navy driver Chule caused an accident on Nanjing Road last night, and a Chinese girl named Chen Huizhen died on the spot, injuring two others. Chule has been detained by the naval authorities today. Witnesses stated the details of the accident as follows: The military truck driven by the driver hit several tricycles and a tram in succession when approaching Chuqing Road on Nanjing Road. Several people on the tram and on the road were also hit, one of whom was Chen Huizhen. The police authorities stated that the truck driven by the driver did not obtain permission and appeared to be caused by drunkenness. According to the information, the situation of the truck accident this time is quite similar to the accident on Albert Road a month ago.</p>
<h3>The Entire Shanghai-Nanjing Highway Will Be Open To Traffic Within Days</h3>
<p>The Shanghai-Nanjing Highway, from Shanghai via Su, Xi, to Wujin section and from Zhen via Jurong to Nan, Jing section have been repaired and are unimpeded. The section from Wujin via Jintan Danyang to Zhenjiang can also be repaired and open to traffic before January 10. It is also heard that the Jiangsu Provincial Government ordered personnel to survey the Shanghai-Taicang Highway from Shanghai via Nanxiang Jiading to Taicang and a section of the Beijing-Hangzhou Line from Jurong via Liyang Jintan to Yixing, and plans to repair it as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Salary Income Tax Stipulates The Standard For Assessment</h3>
<p>How should the income tax of salaried classes be calculated? This question has long been valued by general employees. The Shanghai Direct Taxation Bureau had previously announced that the basic salary would be the standard, and all living allowances, temporary allowances, and rice loans increased due to wartime price fluctuations would not be included. However, since not all employees in this city have basic salary regulations, and the general salaried class does not have a division of salary and allowance for the monthly income, it is not easy to understand how the income should be calculated. According to the person in charge of the Shanghai Direct Taxation Bureau, how should the salary and allowance of employees in various industries without basic salary regulations be divided? It should naturally be stipulated and standardized. In order to be reasonable and fair, the bureau is now referring to the regulations for the amount of salary and allowance for civil servants, that is, subtracting the amount of rice loans and living allowances for local civil servants from the total amount of monthly salary and allowances, and then dividing by the multiple of local civil servants' salary to obtain the taxable income, and then calculating and assessing according to the tax rate table based on this number, and intends to formulate a formula for calculation.</p>
<h3>British Merchant Ship Wanliu Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday from Chongqing</h3>
<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Jiangshun ship is scheduled to sail to Wuhan tomorrow morning, fully loaded with relief supplies. The Taikoo Company's Wanliu ship arrived in Shanghai from Chongqing via Wuhan the day before yesterday. This ship was originally a shallow-water ship on the Sichuan River. During the war, it and the Jiading ship were stationed between Wan and Chongqing. The Wanliu ship was badly damaged, and the Jiading ship has no plans to sail. In addition, the company's Yuezhou ship is scheduled to resume sailing to Hong Kong on the 11th, and the Jardine Matheson Yongsheng ship will also sail to Hong Kong at the same time. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's North and South Ocean lines have no sailing schedule yet.</p>
<h3>The Industrial Association Discusses Holding An Industrial Exhibition</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The National Industrial Association held a dinner last night, attended by Hu Xiyuan, Liu Gongyun, Wu Yunshu, Peng Xuepei, Zhang Zici, etc., and decided to hold a national industrial exhibition in mid-February. Many factories that have moved back from Sichuan, Guangxi and other places will participate.

<h3>The High Court's Criminal Division Tried Two Traitors Yesterday; The Traitor Zhou Yi Was Sentenced To Life Imprisonment</h3>
<p>Ding Guanping, a Hangzhou native, 40 years old, graduated from Fudan and Soochow Law Schools. He served as the director of the North Jiangsu Office of the Puppet Nanjing Food Administration Committee and the director of the Puppet Shanghai Local Procuratorate Detention Center. The case of being sued as a traitor was reviewed yesterday morning by Liu Yugui, President of the Criminal Division of the Shanghai High Court, Judges Cao Jun and Zhu Zonghai, and Prosecutor Lin Woming in the joint trial held in the Tilanqiao Temporary Criminal Court.</p>
<p>Serving In Puppet Posts To Procure Grain</p>
<p>First, Prosecutor Lin Chen stated the main points of the indictment, stating that the defendant served as the director of the North Jiangsu Office of the Puppet Food Administration Committee in August 1942, and as the director of the Puppet Shanghai Local Procuratorate Detention Center in February 1945, purchasing grain for the enemy and the puppet regime, violating Articles 2, Paragraph 1, and Paragraph 5 of the Regulations on Punishing Traitors, and should be tried by the court in accordance with the law. Then, the traitor Ding confessed: "I held the post of director of the North Jiangsu Office of the Puppet Food Administration Committee for a total of eight months. I resigned when the committee was abolished and reorganized into the 'Food Department' in March 1943. The North Jiangsu District governs Yangzhou, Baoying, Taizhou, Gaoyou, and Xinghua counties. I also served as the procurement director in Yangzhou. Since Yangzhou's rice production was not enough for its own consumption, I requested to be exempted from procurement, and the procurement work in the other four counties was handled by special commissioners appointed by the Food Administration Committee. I only supervised, so I did not actually bear the responsibility of procurement. As for the grain procured in the North Jiangsu region, it was all used for the distribution of civil food in the Nanjing and Shanghai areas, which can be proven by retrieving the archives of the Puppet Nanjing Food Administration Committee and the Former Puppet Shanghai Food Bureau. If it is found that there was supply to the enemy, then please punish me with extreme punishment. So-called traitorous officials and rebellious sons, everyone has the right to punish them, even if I die, I will not be wronged. During my tenure as the director of the Puppet Shanghai Detention Center, I held the "post" to improve sanitation and unblock prisoners. Please investigate the facts in detail to clarify the facts." The court held a deliberation on the defendant's request to inspect the Puppet Nanjing Food Administration Committee and the Shanghai Detention Center archives, and ruled that the inspection of the Puppet Nanjing Food Administration Committee was not necessary because the defendant's confession was detailed. The request to inspect the archives of the Puppet Shanghai Food Bureau and the Detention Center should be approved. The defendant's lawyer was asked to prepare a summary report to the court for investigation point by point. After briefly questioning the defendant, it was announced that the hearing would be adjourned because the case still required investigation and evidence, and the defendant was returned to custody.</p>
<p>Extortion, Fraud, and Molesting Women</p>
<p>The High Court also tried Xu Xing, a traitor who molested women, extorted, and defrauded. The defendant is 20 years old, from Suzhou, and served as a pseudo-examiner in Xinzhuang. The prosecutor filed a public prosecution against him for oppressing and extorting people by relying on the power of the enemy and the puppet regime. Xu Jianchang cried loudly and denied this. Then, the victim Yang Songtao was called to testify, stating: "I was transporting rice by bicycle through Xinzhuang. Xu Xing, who was wearing a uniform, came to check at the 'Inspection Office' and demanded 5,000 yuan. Because I have a small business with thin profits, I pleaded bitterly. Xu Ni not only refused but also slapped me twice and threatened to confiscate the goods as a threat. I had no choice but to pay him 5,000 yuan." He also said: "More than 200 people in Xinzhuang hate Xu Ni. If what I said is not true, I am willing to be punished instead." The next witness, Chen Jingchang, stated: "I have personally seen Xu Ni molest women," etc. At this point, Xu Da burst into tears again, still refusing to tell the truth. Later, the appointed lawyer, Fei Xizhen, responded, saying: "The defendant served as an extra inspector in the office and cannot be included in the traitor regulations. Please transfer the case to the local court for handling." The court announced the end of the debate in this case and scheduled the verdict to be announced at 2 pm on the 14th of this month.</p>
<p>Sentenced To Life Imprisonment For Recruiting Laborers For The Enemy</p>
<p>Zhou Yiwei, who recruited laborers to serve as translators for the enemy, was sentenced yesterday afternoon. The main text of the verdict is copied as follows: Zhou Yiwei conspired with the enemy country, recruiting military laborers and craftsmen, and was sentenced to life imprisonment, deprived of political rights for life, and all property confiscated.</p>
<h3>The City's Financial Difficulties Are Under Discussion With the Resources Committee For Assistance</h3>
<p>Shen, Secretary-General of the Municipal Government, said that although the city's tax revenue has increased somewhat under the reorganization of the Finance Bureau, 12 of the 17 types of taxes originally collected by the local government have been ordered to be assigned to the central government. At the beginning of the reconstruction work, there are many things to be done and expenses are huge. The current tax revenue is difficult to offset. However, the construction work of this city needs to be promoted urgently, and it is impossible to give up because of financial difficulties. In addition to trying to save administrative expenses, it is also under discussion with the Resources Committee for assistance, and concrete solutions will be obtained soon. Regarding the method of consolidating the municipal bonds issued before the war, Shen said that it is under thorough study by the Finance Bureau.</p>
<h3>Bandits Extorted A Large Sum of Money And Were Shot Dead By Police Officers</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Yongshengtaili Customs Brokerage, opened by Hu Jinqing, a native of Suzhou, at No. 10, Lane 183, Jinling Road, Lower Box Room, was suddenly attacked by a bandit at about 7:15 last night. The bandit held two hand grenades in both hands, first unplugged the telephone line, drove away six associates, Fang Yi and others, demanded 2 million yuan, and presented a note with the words "Miao Rubao Yin, Commander of the Third Detachment of Jiangnan". Hu Luqing, the brother of the manager, rushed to report to the Huangpu Branch. The branch director Huang Dongsheng, deputy branch director Wang Xiegong, stock captain Shi, patrol officer Yao, stock member Sun, and many plainclothes police officers bravely rushed in. The police fired seven shots at the bandit, all hitting the head, and he died immediately.</p>

The shop owner, Chen Yinkang, was having dinner, so the bandit threatened with a gun. Chen jumped out of the window in a hurry and fell on the road, injuring his left foot and arm. Two bandits seized clothes and more than 4,000 yuan in legal tender and fired shots to show off in front of the Hengda Oil Bank.</p>

<h3>Li Ze Detained and Sent to Court for Investigation on Charges of Colluding with the Enemy, Xinxin Company Employees Hosted the Press Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Li Ze, General Manager of Xinxin Company, after being reported by the company's employees for his treacherous behavior, was arrested by the police yesterday afternoon at the company. It is now reported that he has been sent to the Procuratorate of the Higher Court for legal processing.</p>
<p>The case in which Li Ze was accused of being a traitor by Xinxin Company employees such as Shu Yueqiao was summoned by the Municipal Police Bureau some days ago, but Li Ze did not appear. The accuser, Shu Yueqiao, appeared in court and stated that Li Ze had served as a director of the puppet "Commercial Control Association," a member of the puppet "Sixteen Kinds of Commodity Evaluation Committee," and a member of the puppet "Enemy Property Committee," and that he had sold all the water pipes in the company to the Japanese military, etc. Four other employees of the company, including Yao Zhuoren, testified with similar statements. The bureau, because Li Ze resisted the summons, arrested him at 2:00 PM yesterday.</p>
<p>Trial of Treason According to Law</p>
<p>After interrogation, Li Ze confessed to having served as a director of the puppet "Commercial Control Association" and other organizations, and that the water pipes were sold to a certain iron factory, etc. The police bureau has confirmed that Li Ze's actions constitute treason. The bureau sent the suspect Li to the Shanghai Higher Court at 5:00 PM in accordance with Article 2, Paragraph 5 of the Regulations on the Punishment of Traitors. More than 300 employees of the company have jointly submitted a petition to the Garrison Headquarters, reporting Li Ze for colluding with the enemy. The Inspection Office of the Garrison Headquarters has accepted the case and is now conducting a rigorous investigation into Li Ze's collusion with the enemy and is determined to handle the case with a solemn attitude.</p>
<p>Employees Report Li Ze's Treachery</p>
<p>The employees of Xinxin Company hosted the local press yesterday at 2:00 PM at the company's staff club. Han Wucheng, the employee representative, first reported the process of reporting Li Ze's treacherous behavior to all relevant parties. However, more than three months have passed since the presentation of the report, and the handling methods are still like a stone sinking into the sea. Recently, it was heard that Li Ze was about to depart for the United States to evade the law, so they specially requested the press for two points: First, how to report Li Ze according to the law as soon as possible. Second, how to urge the relevant authorities, who have not yet taken any measures to show attention, so as not to let the big traitor escape the law. Finally, he listed the newspapers that published Li Ze's assumption of puppet positions and crimes, and their publication dates as proof. Then, the representative Shu Yueqiao reported his experience of reporting the treachery, which had been repeatedly frustrated. According to him, strange guests were found in his home from time to time after reporting Li Ze, threatening and intimidating him, but his original intention of reporting the traitor remained unshaken. Finally, each representative reported separately that Li Ze had gradually transferred and dispersed his important private property since August 10 of last year, and recently sold a large number of hoarded goods, such as flannel, money cloth, and so on. A large number of stocks under Li's name have also been transferred.</p>
<p>Military and Police Authorities Devise Methods for Investigation</p>
<p>After the meeting, reporters visited the Laozha Branch of the Police Bureau and the Songhu Garrison Headquarters and other authorities separately. The Laozha Branch believed that this matter should be handled according to law, and it was not convenient to take any measures or express opinions before the investigation was completed. They believed that the posters posted by the employees of Xinxin Company attracted pedestrians to stop and watch, obstructing traffic, so they were banned. The Songhu Garrison Headquarters authorities revealed that Li Ze was indeed arrested yesterday afternoon.</p>
<p>The reporter then visited the management of Xinxin Company afterwards. According to them, Li Ze had applied for leave from the company's board of directors, and the board of directors had approved a month's leave. When asked about Li Ze's arrest, they said they did not know the details. They then stated that the employees of the company's report on Li Ze this time did not conflict with the company's business, so the company continued to operate as usual.</p>
<p>Announcement Published with Such Explanation</p>
<p>The board of directors of Xinxin Company published an announcement in various newspapers today, defending Li Ze, the general idea being: (1) The company hired Japanese advisors to cope with enemy and puppet oppression and personal safety, with no other purpose. (2) The iron offering was actually the Japanese requisition of water pipes, so the water pipes were sold to the Mori Iron Factory. (3) Regarding the dispatch of personnel to the puppet Manchukuo to participate in the celebration, it was the puppet Ministry of Industry who sent personnel to the company to select domestic products, which were said to be transported to the puppet Manchukuo Exposition. This matter had nothing to do with Li Ze, etc.</p>
<p>Commercial News</p>
<h3>US Dollar Form Steady, Gold Prices Suddenly Rise, Government Bonds and Stocks Rebound</h3>
<p>Yesterday, news of rising gold prices in Tianjin and Guanwai, as reported by yesterday's newspaper, attracted scattered buyers, and the price immediately rose to 8.15 million. Since then, people have seen that there is an opportunity to take advantage of in the gold market, and demand exceeded supply. It gradually rose from 8.13 million to over 8.35 million. At this time, large securities firms reused their old tricks, selling gold and pulling stocks. At noon, it hovered around 8.3 million. In the afternoon, speculative funds from the stock market returned one after another, and finally stepped up to over 8.5 million. As a result, it rose sharply by 53,000 compared to last Saturday. Jewelers hung up 90,000 for gold jewelry, 600 yuan for refined silver, and silver allowances still hovered around 430. There was a lot of demand from underground securities firms, and interest rates remained stable at around 10%. Speculative funds from the stock market have been returning for days, and it is even more obvious today. The future should tend to rise.</p>
<p>The US dollar still has no special changes. It is said that the gold market is advancing and retreating together, and the arbitrageurs are entering and exiting at a difference of 585 yuan to ten taels, gradually improving from 1425 yuan to 1460 yuan. As a result, it was 50 yuan better than last Saturday. Hong Kong bills are still extremely mediocre, so that both new and old goods are similar to last week. Government bonds fell back after rising. Many bulls in the industry closed out at high prices, and Class C gradually fell from 965 yuan. Although there was no shortage of retail support in the middle, the general trend was gone, and the hype was weak, so it broke the 900 yuan mark and ended with a mediocre situation. As a result, hot stocks fell and miscellaneous stocks rose compared to last Saturday. This is a matter of time, and they have not caught up.</p>
<p>Chinese stocks were the securities firms reusing their old tricks, first drawing the firewood from under the pot and then using the golden cicada to shed its shell. The market situation was initially lively and then tired. It was once again pulled up in the middle. By 11:45, the large firms turned their heads and were unwilling, and retail investors rushed to kill, but it was too late, and the situation was extremely miserable. Yongsheng Yarn was pulled up twice to a new high of 1060 yuan, and ended with the lowest price of 980 yuan. Mei Ya also repeatedly saw a high price of 830 yuan, but no one wanted it at the lowest price of 720 yuan. The three small hot stocks, such as Xin Guang, also fell by more than 10% from the higher prices at the close. As a result, compared with last Saturday, Yongsheng Yarn was flat, Mei Ya fell by 15 yuan, and the three small hot stocks fell slightly by 50 cents to 1 yuan. However, due to the time factor, various unpopular stocks still showed a brilliant scene.</p>
<p>There were many foreign stock requests for supply, with three twists and turns. Generally, they advanced and retreated with Chinese stocks, initially firm and then tired, and then pulled up again near noon. However, each stock has been rising for a long time and has reached saturation. Many parties have profited, and there are many who see the opportunity to close out. The chips have changed from tight to loose, and there are cracks in the potential. As a result, the popular stocks had mixed fortunes compared to last Saturday. Rubber stocks were relatively deserted, and although the closing price was higher, it was the supplier's asking price.</p>
<h3>Yarn Market Rising Wind Not Yet Over</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market became more and more outstanding. At the beginning of the morning market, there was a general rush. The sales of customer gangs were not as enthusiastic as last week, but the retail investors were thinking high and buying incessantly. At the same time, it was rumored that a certain number in the Securities Building would start operating small-amount transactions in cotton yarn, using the 20-count red Ren Zhongzhan bill of the Shenxin No. 1 Factory as a chip, which was quite favored by speculators, and the price was between 770,000 and 780,000. The current yarn market is even more invigorated because of this. The price of 20-count ordinary yarn rose by about 50,000. Special Double Horse has jumped a lot in recent days, and the Guangbang buyers are slightly inferior, only rising by 20,000 to 30,000, with a transaction price of 870,000 to 880,000. Fine yarn and double thread, weaving factories and sock factories still come to drag in. In the case of a strange shortage of spot goods, it has risen by another 100,000.</p>
<h3>Rice Market Transactions Stagnant</h3>
<p>There are more than 100 ships storing rice in the Zhabei He Xia area, and more than 100 ships are also stored in the Nanshi He Xia area. The market is stagnant, and japonica rice, indica rice, and early rice are still scarce and lack transactions. Because the production area of ​​indica rice is high, forming a reversal, very few cars arrive. The market situation is still stable, and Baiyuan is similar. The Nanyang route of flour continues, and the market situation is firm. The arrival of soybeans is scarce, and the Minbang Xinghua Quanzhou continues to operate, and the trend is stable. The oil market is operated by the Zhejiang Fangning side, and the price continues to rise by 1,000 yuan. Raw peanuts and sesame seeds are firmly established, soybean cake slightly rises by dozens of yuan, Shantou slightly takes, vegetable cake is established, and wine prices are stable.</p>
<h3>Silk and Satin Unanimously Upward</h3>
<p>Yesterday's silk and satin market was unanimously lively. At the opening of the morning market, 120 Tiqiao, 770,000 yuan for rayon, because each silk factory had a strong appetite, the transaction between the same industry was not lonely, and there was a lack of spot goods. Furthermore, because it was rumored that the enemy and puppet warehouses would be opened indefinitely, the market atmosphere was strong, and people's hearts were prosperous. The selling price rose step by step, and the closing price of 120 Tiqiao was as high as 850,000 yuan, and semi-gloss was 830,000 yuan. However, after hearing that the Chinese merchants' warehouses were about to open, the silk factories needed it, or the energy source was continuously supplied, I am afraid that it will cause a high face of no rice for cooking. The sales of factory silk were not bad and the price also soared. High uniformity was 1.3 million yuan per load, medium grade was 1.1 million yuan per load, and ordinary grade was 900,000 yuan. The silk market slightly increased the selling price due to expensive raw materials and rising costs. Mei Ya was covered with 550,000 yuan per 100 pieces, Dazheng Geli Bixuan was 1,600 yuan per yard, and Minsheng brocade was 8,500 yuan per piece.</p>
<h3>Coal Ball Retail Sales Are Surprisingly Smooth, Coal Market Trend is Gradually Stable</h3>
<p>Coal, firewood, and charcoal are not lonely in actual consumption, and the source is constant, and the market is still stable. Coal balls are an essential fuel for general household users. In the past, the main raw material, white coal dust, was not smooth in source. A few coal ball manufacturers mixed it with coal slag as a substitute, resulting in poor quality, weak firepower, and loss of reputation. Now that the source of raw materials is promising and the supply of electric power is smooth, coal ball manufacturers have improved the quality to facilitate business. In addition, it is the winter season, and coal balls can be used for heating in addition to being a regular fuel for general households, so consumption has increased sharply, and actual sales are surprisingly smooth. At present, the manufacturing cost of ordinary guaranteed burning coal balls containing 50% coal dust is about 45,000 yuan per ton (35,000 yuan for direct raw materials, 3,000 yuan for direct labor, and 7,000 yuan for manufacturing expenses). The retail price of coal shops is 3,000 yuan per load, and the secondary grades range from 1,500 yuan to 2,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Asphalt Demand Exceeds Supply</h3>
<p>Asphalt is in high demand for candle making, and dealers are not supplying much. The source is becoming increasingly scarce, so dealers and candle workshops are purchasing from various producing areas. It is said that dealers purchased hundreds of pieces from Jiaxing at a cost of 18,000 yuan, and candle workshops purchased dozens of pieces at a cost of 18,500 yuan, both for delivery. They also purchased 15,500 yuan to 16,000 yuan of Lan oil from Hangzhou, and 12,500 yuan to 13,000 yuan from Lanxi, all for delivery on the spot, with a total of hundreds of pieces, which can be loaded in a few days. The price of Heshi oil sold by dealers is 22,000 yuan, the price of Lan oil tip goods is 18,000 yuan, and the price of second-grade is 16,000 yuan. Demand exceeds supply, and the trend is still bullish.</p>
<h3>After the Reopening of the Tobacco Exchange Market, the Transaction Methods are Stipulated</h3>
<p>After the reopening of the tobacco exchange market, the market transactions are stipulated as follows: If a transaction is concluded in the morning, the payment must be paid and the goods must be delivered before 6:00 PM on the same afternoon. If the transaction is concluded in the afternoon, it must be cleared before 12:00 AM the next morning. If either party delays or breaches the contract, they must compensate the other party for the loss. When the goods rise in price, the market price on the same day must be followed. When the price falls, in addition to the loss, interest must also be paid.</p>
<h3>Customer Gang's Actual Sales are Activated, Paper Prices are Gradually Rising, Especially White Newsprint</h3>
<p>After the opening of the foreign paper, it is gradually rising, because the scheduled arrival of goods is indefinite, and the customer gangs have activated actual sales, canceling the wait-and-see attitude, and advancing fiercely. Moreover, the bottom is shallow, and demand exceeds supply. Today, the paper price is even more firm due to the rising gold price and the accompanying rise in the US dollar. Among them, white newsprint is the most, because the demand is the most.</p>
<h3>Economic Briefing</h3>
<p>Eastern Zhejiang native products are coming in continuously. The Ping An Bureau Dahua Wheel arrived in Shanghai the day before (Sunday), transporting 3,000 bags of sugar and more than 2,000 pieces of wood from Wenzhou. The wheel will leave for Fuzhou tomorrow morning, transporting 2,000 bags of Fujian flour from Shanghai. There are still a large number of Jianzi transported back to Shanghai.</p>
<p>The Municipal Mechanized Coal Ball Industry Association gathered funds from all colleagues to purchase a large amount of white coal dust from the coal-producing areas along the Yangtze River. Now, because the coal loading ship Yuanli Wheel is still stranded in Yangzhou, the purchasing delegation has to postpone its departure.</p>
<p>The five-year plan for post-war cooperation will be implemented starting in January. It is reported that it is planned to establish 189,019 cooperative units in the next five years, not including the 360,943 units already established nationwide.</p>
<p>The reserves of the pseudo-Manchukuo banknotes issued by the pseudo-Central Bank in the 34th year of pseudo-Manchukuo accounted for about 60%. In view of this fact, the government authorities decided that the exchange rate of the Northeast circulation coupons would be equivalent to that of the Manchukuo pseudo-money, that is, one yuan of circulation equals one yuan of pseudo-money.</p>
<p>The national land tax will be levied starting this year, and it is reported to include the following three items: (1) Field tax, (2) Deed tax, (3) Land boundary tax. The land tax portion of the annual budget for the 35th year is about 90 billion yuan.</p>
<p>The exchange rate of legal tender in Keelung is approximately 25 to 30 yuan. The office set up by the Central Bank in Taiwan is actively planning to collect and exchange it. The price of gold in the area is approximately 3,400 Taiwan dollars per tael.</p>
<p>The administrative expenses budget of the Ministry of Finance for this year is approximately 53.3 billion yuan, of which approximately 5.5 billion yuan is for recurring expenses, more than 300 million yuan is for business expenses, 44 billion yuan is for living allowances, and 3.1 billion yuan is for temporary expenses.</p>
<p>The Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant of the Beizhi Iron and Steel Co., Ltd., which was taken over by our side in Beiping, is said to have a capital of 300 million. It has been completely taken over a few days ago. The mine plans to produce 1,200 tons of iron per day. Before Japan surrendered, it was able to produce 500 tons of iron per day, double the 250 tons per day in the Longyan mine era.</p>
<h3>Commercial Situation Summary</h3>
<p>Green sugar has always been concentrated in Hangzhou. Today, the Hangzhou market has risen, affecting the sugar price in the city, which is 5,000 yuan higher than the previous market. The price of four or five white markets is also tight.</p>
<p>The price of raw peanuts in the North-South goods market has been repeatedly increased. The sales price of persimmon cakes and red dates has been continuously increased. Black dates are scarce, and the price has also been greatly increased. Golden vegetables, black fungus, and bamboo shoots are all favored by customers, and the price is very tight.</p>
<p>Seafood dealers saw that the gold market was rising, followed up, and the price of each commodity rose as soon as the market opened, about 20% to 30% higher than the market.</p>
<p>The customer gang pursued dyed cotton cloth extremely eagerly. The dyeing and weaving factories waited to supply and sell as much as possible. Unfortunately, the white base was still tight. The market situation was advancing in the high peak. Lily dried was in short supply this year due to very little production. Now, the Guangdong going out is gradually moving, and the market situation is very tight. The current dry and white goods in the market are sold for 30,000 yuan, and the ordinary goods are 25,000 yuan. It is said that the bottom of the producing area is very scarce.</p>
<p>The tea shops and Tianjin gang's buying interest in tea leaves are not lonely. A total of more than 450 tea groups, including coarse Mao black tea, medium-grade Hubei black, and Anhui baked green tea, were transacted in the city, and the market was bullish.</p>
<p>Yesterday's knitted goods market can be said to have risen without exception, especially 32-count socks and towels. The reason for this is the influence of both the gold and yarn prices.</p>
<p>Yesterday's cigarette market was lively due to the opening of the market and the prosperity of the gold market. Although there was rationing, the bullish trend was not suppressed. The market situation was steadily rising throughout the day.</p>

<h3>Assorted Pennants</h3>
<p>— Chen Fengxiong</p>
<p>Jinzhou's climate is slightly milder than Beiping's, but with a gust of wind, the temperature drops suddenly. Recently, it has been as cold as twenty degrees below zero. Many Guangdong soldiers in the National Army have already experienced the biting cold. At the mention of having to go to even colder Shenyang, even while sitting around the stove, they can't help but shrink their necks and shiver.</p>
<p>Within Jinzhou city, there are still many strangely worded slogans that have not been cleaned off. For example, above the entrance of the Da Xing Company established by the Japanese (now the receiving office of the Transportation Department's Shenyang District and a radio station) is a banner painted with the words "Without the ×× Party, there would be no China," each character two feet square. Despite repeated scrubbing, it is still clearly visible.</p>
<p>Many sections of the asphalt roads have been dug up as trenches, which the Japanese were forced to dig before the National Army entered the city in preparation for resistance. Now, the Japanese are busy filling in those trenches that affect traffic. According to locals, these trenches were never used.</p>
<p>It is said that when the National Army entered the city, the pseudo-Jinzhou Railway Bureau (now the Northeast Security Commander-in-Chief Headquarters) had already poured kerosene in the building, but the National Army entered the city before they could set it on fire. Only the telephone bureau in Jinzhou was bombed, with more than half of the three-story steel-reinforced concrete building destroyed. Workers are now busy repairing it. In addition, the most tragic was the pseudo-Jinzhou Provincial Government Office, which burned for three days and three nights, leaving not a single tile intact. Locals say, "There were so many good things inside, everything you could want was there, all burned!"</p>
<p>The Xiaoling River, west of Jinzhou city, is now dry. The three bridges over the river have all been blown up. Two of them are iron bridges, railway bridges, and one is a cement bridge, a highway bridge, all four to five hundred meters long. The iron bridges have now been repaired and are about to be converted to standard gauge for traffic. A section of the highway bridge was blown up, and it is said that it took six attempts to destroy it. On December 16th, it was heard that Chairman Chiang was going to inspect Jinzhou from Beiping, and the highway bridge over the Xiaoling River was the only way to enter the city from the airfield. The Commander-in-Chief Headquarters temporarily gathered four hundred Japanese people to work through the night by gaslight, building a simple road for cars on the riverbed and between the banks. Unfortunately, Chairman Chiang was too busy with official duties to fly to Jinzhou, and the people couldn't help but feel a little disappointed.</p>
<p>Jinzhou's specialties are shrimp paste and apples. A large bottle of shrimp paste only sells for ten yuan, cheaper than water in Chongqing. The apples are fragrant, crisp, and delicious, with an excellent taste, costing thirty yuan per catty. After Governor Du heard that Chairman Chiang was going to inspect Jinzhou, he specially ordered people to buy three large baskets of apples (about a hundred catties per basket) to present to the Chairman to take back to Chongqing. It is unknown whether those apples are now fortunate enough to be lying in the fruit bowl of the Lin Garden official residence.</p>
<p>Jinzhou's prices cannot be compared to Chongqing's because there is no standard. The legal tender stamped by Governor Du is used at the same value as the puppet Manchurian currency, but because the denominations are too large (at least five hundred yuan), merchants cannot make change, so the market has been inactive. For example, buying an egg costs four yuan and fifty cents, and when a National Army soldier pulls out a thousand yuan note, it is difficult for small merchants to return nine hundred and several tens of yuan. Of course, the National Army has no other bills, so merchants have to say, "Comrade, pay us when you have change, a few yuan doesn't matter, we really can't make change!" Soldiers also say, "Shopkeeper, you have to recognize my mark, I'm not cheating you!" Everyone is amicable: the merchants, seeing the light of day again, cannot hide their heartfelt joy and often generously treat the soldiers for free. Some merchants, fearing that customers will buy their goods with large bills, only bring a small amount of goods to the market to sell, because even if you bought all of their goods, it would only cost dozens of yuan, requiring small bills. After they sell out, they go back and bring out a little more. Some people simply close their doors and do no business, or hide their goods, and if you ask to buy anything, they have nothing. When I first arrived in Jinzhou, I borrowed several thousand yuan to go out for dinner, but I couldn't find a formal restaurant in Jinzhou. Finally, I walked into a small shop that only sold sorghum rice and tofu soup, and the shop assistant immediately said, "Sir, you need to use small bills to eat here!" I had no choice but to go back to the hotel hungry.</p>
<p>Governor Du ordered an absolute ban on merchants entering and leaving Shanhaiguan to purchase goods. Several Tianjin merchants brought some goods and secretly sold them in Jinzhou, and then bought a lot of cotton thread (over a thousand yuan per bundle, which could be sold for twenty thousand yuan in Tianjin). They were stopped at the train station and had to sell the cotton thread cheaply again. They stayed in a small shop for a few days and took some pseudo-Manchurian currency back to Tianjin, which was worthless inside the pass.</p>
<p>Legal tender below fifty yuan, even if not stamped by Governor Du, can also be used. I had four ten-yuan bills in my pocket, which I never had a chance to use in Chongqing, but I ran to Jinzhou and got a haircut and bought a catty of apples. Japanese merchants also welcome small legal tender bills. At least the legal tender is printed much more elaborately than the pseudo-currency.</p>
<p>Now, the Jinzhou Central Bank has opened, and banknotes are already being issued. It is said that the market is much more active than it was a few days ago. The old city's South Gate is Jinzhou's entertainment district, with theaters, cinemas, and brothels. The Japanese brothels that recently opened are all in the new city, and business is not bad. Sometimes, one or two gaudily dressed Japanese prostitutes are seen riding past on tricycles, making one feel as if one had found a rose in a desolate mountain.</p>
<p>Outside the East Gate is the marketplace, where hundreds of vendors are selling odds and ends and old items on the ground, and the food stalls only offer sesame cakes, barley porridge, and Guandong candy. When these vendors hear the accents of people from other provinces asking about prices, they ask for the sky. Because they know that these are all wealthy people with large bills on them.</p>

<h3>The Joke of Driving on the Right</h3>
<p>— Mao Shukei</p>
<p>Today is the eighth day of implementing right-hand driving for vehicles. Citizens have gradually become accustomed to it, moving from novelty to habit. Pedicabs and tricycles naturally keep to the right. Cars, aware of being the root cause of trouble, drive with caution, and their speed has clearly slowed down. Only the Allied jeeps continue to speed back and forth as before. It turns out that they are used to driving on the right. Now that they are skilled at it, it is no wonder. Although there have been several vehicle accidents during these days, similar to peacetime, few of them are actually caused by driving on the right. The intersections of various roads can also be said to be orderly. This is the effect of prior publicity efforts, right?</p>
<p>Last October, the British *Times* suddenly published an article describing the chaotic situation in our wartime capital on the first day of vehicle conversion to right-hand driving, with cars colliding with pedicabs, pedicabs pulling onto sidewalks, and cows and horses braying in a mess. It turned out that our country's right-hand driving was originally scheduled to be implemented on October 1st of last year, but later the enemy surrendered. More important things needed to be done, such as accepting the surrender and taking over, so it was postponed to New Year's Day of this year. This *Times* reporter stationed in Chongqing probably wrote the article based on assumptions, sent it back to his country long ago to be published in a periodical, and then forgot about the postponement. That's how this joke happened. This shows that foreigners expected it to be very difficult for our country, which has been accustomed to driving on the left for decades, to suddenly switch to driving on the right. It cannot be denied that changing customs is not an easy task, especially in Shanghai, which has 127,000 vehicles of all kinds. But the facts tell us that the achievements of the past few days are enough to make this *Times* "prophet" feel ashamed. I pray that the Allied jeeps, having adapted to their habit of right-hand driving, will no longer cause accidents in the future. At the same time, I hope that all vehicles in the city will continue to exercise caution and complete this historic reform in a bloodless manner.</p>

<h3>Chongqing Snippets</h3>
<p>— Mei Youyun</p>
<p>Starting from New Year's Day, rickshaw pullers are shouting "Right hand!" in the downtown area. The sound of "Left hand" is no longer heard. When the slogan "Vehicles and horses keep to the right, pedestrians keep to the side" first appeared, someone said, "Damn it! Vehicles and horses keep to the right, who is left to walk on the left?" I wonder if that gentleman has figured it out now?</p>
<p>Various bookstores have hung up banners with "New Year's Big Discount," but although the stores are packed, few people are buying. Most of them are friends who stand and read everything before leaving, because they can browse at will and save a lot of trouble compared to borrowing books from the library. Can we blame the "book readers"? No! People who like to find books to read here are mostly people who do not like or are not good at "making money."</p>
<p>Movie theaters have suspended operations over ticket prices, demanding tax exemptions. The actual ticket price is 500 yuan per ticket. The government is unwilling to reduce taxes and unwilling to increase the burden on citizens, so the issue is still "deadlocked."</p>
<p>The dance craze in the mountain city is growing. The "Shanghai Dancers" hired by the Yangtze River Ballroom from Shanghai have arrived in Chongqing to perform "dance instructor" duties and have started working.</p>
<p>"Sleeve," the only dance drama weekly in Chongqing, plans to hold an election for the "Top Five Dance Stars of Chongqing." The organizer is Li Luzi, the author of "Chongqing Insider."</p>

<h3>Non-Anger</h3>
<p>— Dasha</p>
<p>The explosion of anger is formed by the accumulation of many small worries. Most people, especially young people, have latent or erupting anger. When we examine the source of anger, it is mostly due to external pressure, restlessness of mind, and inability to be calm and self-controlled. When interacting with others, we suffer grievances and insults, which excite our heartstrings and cause us to find ways to vent. It's like hitting a spring, which will inevitably vibrate.</p>
<p>Professor Stadden, a psychologist, believes that "anger is an expression of human nature, and everyone can be angry. However, anger can lead to many disasters and resentments." He believes that getting angry is a risky thing. Getting angry can lead to alienation, and the tragic result is the destruction of friendship and colleagues. Psychologists have researched many methods to control and guide human anger. Regarding the psychological state of anger, most psychologists believe that a safety valve should be used to properly restrain it. Getting angry is like the release of steam. When there is too much steam, the machine can't keep up and trouble will result, so a safety valve should be used to close the "steam."</p>
<p>It is very unworthy to get angry when someone angers you. You should restrain your anger and seek some appropriate way to vent it that will not harm your emotions, such as boxing or singing opera. Psychologists say, "In a very critical situation, when encountering someone who is angry, the best way to deal with it is to remain calm, clear, and peaceful."</p>
<p>Sometimes the arrival of anger can expand our future. We must guide anger into positive action to advance our careers. Lao Tzu said in the Tao Te Ching, "Those who are good at being soldiers are not warlike, those who are good at fighting are not angry, those who are good at defeating the enemy do not contend, and those who are good at using people put themselves below them. This is called the virtue of non-contention, this is called using the strength of others, this is called matching the ancient peak." The "those who are good at fighting are not angry" means that "those who are not angry have the confidence to win." "Non-anger" is a good proverb for dealing with the world.</p>

<h3>Enrollment Retention Fee</h3>
<p>— Yanqiu</p>
<p>Two or three weeks before the end of each semester, the school authorities prepare for the enrollment retention fee issue. Our school is of course no exception. Last Friday, we received a notice from the school regarding the enrollment retention fee, which read as follows:</p>
<p>"Each student should pay an enrollment retention fee of 1,000 yuan in legal tender, from × month × day to × month × day. If the student does not pay the enrollment retention fee but still comes to the school next semester, they will be treated as a new student. If the enrollment retention fee is paid but the student does not come to the school next semester, the fee will not be refunded."</p>
<p>From the above notice, it can be seen that the purpose of collecting the enrollment retention fee is money, not retention. How can we tell? Just look at the notice: If you pay but don't come, there will be no refund. This shows that they only know how to take in and not how to give out, and they stipulate the deadline for paying the enrollment retention fee before school is out. They also don't know how much tuition will be due next semester? If the tuition fee for the next semester is announced and the parents cannot afford the tuition, wouldn't the 1,000 yuan enrollment retention fee be wasted? Now I have an idea, but I don't know if it's appropriate?</p>
<p>The idea is that the enrollment retention fee should not be legal tender, but a letter. The student's parents should write a letter of enrollment retention, signed and sealed, to avoid joking. This proves that the student will still attend school next semester. If the tuition fee for the next semester is too expensive and they cannot afford to study, the parents can decline with a letter.</p>

<h3>Soldier Treatment Issues</h3>
<p>— Shu Mei</p>
<p>"Wu Qi ran to Chu and explained to King Dao of Chu the way to enrich the country and strengthen the army, saying: 'The state of Chu has a territory of thousands of miles and more than a million soldiers. It should dominate the feudal lords and be the leader of the world. The reason why it cannot surpass other countries is that the way of raising soldiers has been lost. The way of raising soldiers is to first enrich their wealth and then use their strength. Now, officials who are not urgent fill the court, and distant relatives squander public funds, while soldiers only have enough food left to eat a peck or two. How can they be expected to sacrifice their lives for the country? If Your Majesty truly listens to my plan, eliminates redundant officials, dismisses distant relatives, and uses all the salary to treat brave soldiers, and if the country's prestige does not rise, then I will accept the punishment for false words.' King Dao followed his plan. Many ministers said that Qi's words should not be used, but King Dao did not listen. Therefore, he sent Wu Qi to assess the official system, and he eliminated hundreds of redundant officials. The children of high officials were not allowed to steal positions through connections, and those of the royal family above the fifth generation were ordered to support themselves and be compared to commoners. Those below the fifth generation were reduced according to their degree of kinship. Several tens of thousands of national taxes were saved. Elite soldiers were selected from the country for training day and night, and their wealth and equipment were reviewed to increase their salary and food up to several times. All the soldiers competed to exert themselves, and Chu became powerful in the world because of its army.'"</p>
<p>A few days ago, I saw an appeal from a soldier in a certain newspaper, the gist of which was that the monthly salary of only three or four hundred yuan was not enough for any use. The implication seemed to be that their past wind and dew, life and death, were really "not worth it."</p>
<p>This is a very bad phenomenon. Could such a psychological evolution lead to some rather serious misfortune?</p>
<p>Reading *Strategies of the Warring States* by chance, I saw an article about improving the treatment of soldiers, which could not help but evoke many feelings. I am recording it, perhaps as a reference.</p>

<h3>Postal Rocket</h3>
<p>— Junyi</p>
<p>Rockets were originally powerful weapons of air warfare, but recently they have become available for postal work. The inventor is Professor Harry, a famous British scientist. Harry served in the Royal Air Force for a long time, and his original goal was to facilitate the swift transmission of intelligence. After the war ended, he planned to convert it for postal use. Harry began researching postal rockets in 1941. He not only spent all his assets on research, but also borrowed a sum from the headquarters where he worked.</p>
<p>In September of last year, Harry experimented with postal rockets in Blackpool, northern England, with great success. Harry has not yet officially announced the structure of this rocket, but it is only known that its weight is reduced by three-fifths compared to military rockets, and its composition contains a lot of aluminum, so it is very light and the speed can be increased tenfold compared to military rockets. A rocket launched from London could reach San Francisco, USA, in 53 minutes.</p>

<h3>American Resource Losses</h3>
<p>— Bao Zhongzuo</p>
<p>The United States has suffered enormous losses of natural resources in this war. According to confidential estimates by the US government, from 1941 to 1945, it used up a quarter of its oil reserves, seven-tenths of its iron ore resources, one-fifth of its copper, and one-quarter of its lead and zinc. Furthermore, according to forecasts by the US Bureau of Mines, natural gas reserves can only be used for 49 years, copper for 29 years, zinc for 19 years, oil for 18 years, gold for 14 years, lead for 12 years, and silver for 11 years. Other metals such as tungsten, platinum, mercury, asbestos, manganese, nickel, and zinc are almost exhausted and will need to rely on overseas imports for years to come.</p>
<p>These metals that the United States lacks are all extremely important in industry. For example, tungsten can increase the hardness of steel, which is necessary for high-speed cutting of the large quantities of products that need to be shortened.</p>
<p>The United States is now planning to spend money to purchase large quantities of metal minerals necessary for military equipment from abroad to compensate for the loss of natural resources in this war.</p>

<h3>Answer to Why Children Are Not Allowed in Movie Theaters</h3>
<p>— Song Guobin</p>
<p>This topic appeared in this column on the 28th of last month. I, from a hygienic and medical point of view, answer as follows: The most common route of transmission of infectious diseases is through the mouth and nose. The mouth and nose are the doors for the body to contact the outside world. Summer diseases such as typhoid fever, cholera, dysentery, and epidemic dysentery are all transmitted through the mouth; winter diseases such as influenza, pneumonia, measles, diphtheria, and meningitis are all transmitted through the nose. (In ancient times, people did not know about germs and believed that "evil spirits" were at work, but in fact, most germs travel with the wind and are transmitted through the air. The name "evil spirit" is not entirely inapplicable.) These types of germs are spread in the air by patients or carriers coughing, and others inhale them through their noses, thus forming a transmission. Although the conditions for transmission are not so simple, most germs are very fragile and do not easily thrive without a suitable environment. Once they encounter dryness and low temperatures, they lose their ability to reproduce. The most suitable environment for transmission is probably public places of entertainment. In winter, windows are tightly closed, and heating is turned on. The air is not circulated, and the temperature and humidity are extremely suitable for the survival of germs. Therefore, if there are patients or carriers in the audience, a cough will scatter germs in all directions, invading and attacking the neighboring seats and achieving their transmission offensive. Children's bodies are delicate and easily infected, and there is more than one person coughing, and more than one person is infected under one cough, and more than one disease is spread. This is why the above-mentioned diseases easily become epidemic between winter and spring. Therefore, in my opinion, not only should children not be allowed in entertainment venues, but also adults with coughs should automatically stay away to avoid harming others. This is not only related to public health, but also beneficial to the promotion of hygiene ethics. What does the public think?</p>
<p>This article was written by Dr. Song Guobin, a consultant to the Shanghai Health Bureau, and is of course very valuable based on his rich academic knowledge and experience. I hope that readers will pay attention: Do not casually set foot in public places if you have an infectious disease to avoid harming others; parents, in order to protect their young children, should not risk taking them into such places. If both parties pay attention, it will be a small contribution to public health. (Editor)</p>

<h3>Regarding Housing Adjustment Problems - Please Establish a Method to Relieve People's Hardship</h3>
<p>Dear Editor: A very serious social problem lying before us that needs to be resolved is the adjustment of rent increases between second landlords and third tenants. Isn't the city government now stipulating that rent increases should be 40 times the increase in 1937? But now, the first landlords are increasing rent to the second landlords using the equivalent amount of the fake currency in legal tender, and the second landlords are increasing rent to the third tenants, of course, also converting the fake currency to legal tender. On the surface, it seems very fair, but when the second landlords rented the houses from the first landlords, the rent was of course very small, and the increase is very limited. The rent of the second landlords who sublet to the third tenants has already been greatly increased, especially those who rented after the war. If the increase is 40 times, they will not be able to afford it. If the fake currency is converted to legal tender, how can they cope with it? For example, if a second landlord sublets a house to someone for 1,400 yuan per month, now it needs to be changed to 1,400 yuan in legal tender. The second landlord increases the rent to the first landlord by a small amount, but increases the rent to the third tenant by the same amount, which allows them to reap profits for nothing. This matter is related to the housing of millions of citizens in the city and is extremely serious. Although there are many appeals of injustice in the newspapers every day, the municipal authorities have not adjusted it. Fearing that in the future, housing disputes will inevitably become more and more intense, I have already tasted this flavor. I dare to ask your newspaper to speak out for justice and appeal to the municipal government to quickly adjust: (1) Reiterate the previous order to strictly prohibit using the conversion of fake currency to legal tender as the standard for rent increases; (2) The second landlord's rent increase should be increased in terms of pre-war and post-war, and should not be treated in general; (3) Promptly stipulate the standard for rent increases between second landlords and third tenants; (4) After the adjustment, if the third tenants have already paid excess rent, it should be deducted from the rent. If the above-mentioned are adopted by the municipal government, then housing disputes in this city can be reduced, and the suffering of the third tenants in the city can be alleviated, which is truly a great merit. Sincerely, Sun Xiaozhu</p>
<h3>Inquiry About the Route to Xi'an</h3>
<p>Dear Editor: We just came from the countryside and our purpose is to go to Xi'an, but we don't know how to get there? Is the traffic blocked? And how much travel expenses are needed per person, so as not to suffer the pain of being stranded in a foreign land? I am really very sorry to bother you for your time, and I hope you can take the time to tell us in detail, and we will be very grateful.</p>
<p>Respectfully, Shen Zenan</p>
<p>(Answer) To get to Xi'an, first take the train to Nanjing, cross the river to Pukou, take the Jinpu train to Xuzhou, and change to the Longhai Railway heading west, all the way is smooth. The amount of travel expenses can be inquired from the China Travel Service. (The company is located on Sichuan Road, north of Nanjing Road)</p>
