<p>〔合衆社重慶四日電〕今日重慶籌備一英雄式歡迎大會，藉以款待前任美駐華第十四航空隊司令陳納德少將，陳納德將軍於星期三飛離舊金山，將在華就任一民航或空軍方而職位。渠前在華所率之著名「飛虎」，曾控制台灣東北間廣大領域，深入日軍領空，政府常局與軍界方面，對於陳納德在華職位無所披露，據本社來自紐約之報告謂，第十四航空隊隊員僉信，此「飛虎」之首領，必將以平民資格在華訓練靑年空軍人員無疑。此間人士以爲，陳納德行前在舊金山曾請將渠此行消息勿予公布，故陳納德之職位問題，必將由其本人宣布，因中國當局尊重其要求故也。渠之「飛虎」們，曾在中國領空聲落不少日機，並爲中國軍隊奪復廣大之安全區域於戰時初期，渠之任務顯非易事，其時飛機數目旣不充裕，供應又惑缺，乏取道印度至中國之空運，更需偉大之計劃，笨重之供應品，自美國空運至足以運用之中國地區，需時七十五至九十日。該供應綫可謂全球上最長之一條，全程計一萬六千哩，一九四三年四月，美空軍於長期準備後，在中國東南開始作戰，是年三月間，陳納德將軍指揮之第十四航空隊，以個別之單位，在華成立美空軍。開始其第一次攻擊前不久，日空軍重又採取攻勢，同時日陸戰隊在雷州半島上之法租借地廣州灣登陸，建築飛機塲，對抗盟軍。美空軍第一次攻擊後一月，第十四航空隊即向被日軍佔領之海南島及越南北部河內海防區予以痛擊，是年五月，日軍以五師之衆，總攻宜昌，常德，重慶，終於失敗。中美空軍人員，於宜昌上空曾擊洛日機三十一架，中美空軍之攻勢，此時已趨向高潮，一九四三年感恩節日，中美混合空軍隊轟炸台灣某機塲，擊毀日機甚多，全隊安然返防。一年之後，中國上空已佈滿解放式轟炸機上之「飛虎」，其功果今已有目共睹矣。</p>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕美軍總部昨日報告，在華美軍現佔全部美軍百分之一三·四，業巳大量減少，蓋去年十月佔全部百分之三二·一也。　〔合衆社天津三日電〕此間陸戰隊司令部今日宣稱：美海軍陸戰隊高級官員及士兵之調任，全面加增其速度，據官方宜布將有官兵五千人搭乘即將抵華前孟哈登奢華郵船盛克菲爾特號返美。該郵船將載來同數之調防人員，同時日軍民之遺返工作，於短時期停頓後亦重行開始，在此短時休止期間，，美方曾派遣坦克登陸艇前往上海協助遣送，今日因巨風吹襲塘沽港口，天津開出火車被迫折回，故遣送工作暫停，第一陸戰師及第三兩棲部隊，的有三千六百名士兵，一百名官員搭乘盛克菲爾特號郵船返國，可望於一月十日左右在塘沽上船，該船將於靑島暫停，搭載第六師一部份官員，然後逕返加里福尼亞之桑迪谷，估計的於一月卅一日可到目的地。</p>

<p>〔本報北平三日電〕宋院長在北平已經完成他大部的工作，明天就要到天津去，那裏的大沽新港和幾個大紗廠，將是他視察的最大目標。宋院長蒞平一週，辦了兩件大事，郵電加價暫緩實行，如果按照全國一律的價格，華北人民將從兩塊錢送一封信變成廿元送一封信，新聞記者拍急電到上海去，將從每字八角跳到兩元，一旦實行，以對物價的影響，不間可知。他成立代表最高權力的政院辦事處，解決接收中不合理的現象，一個大門上只准貼一個封條，而且還要迅速的把這一個封條撕掉，讓裏面的馬達轉動起來，復工的原則大致決定，性質相同的工廠，歸併起來，例如天津的紡織，北平的製鐵，都不能同時有兩個機構，一些小的工廠，將予開放，歡迎民間資本參加，各工廠復工所需資金，可呈准政府向銀行貸款，一般的工廠，在三個月內可完全復工，條件比複雜的工廠，恃均會延遲到四個月以上，石景山製鐵廠是敵人在華北遺留最可寶貴的工業，但是他要仰給共產軍控制下的龍烟鐵礦的原料，目前復工就成爲不可能了。</p>
<p>〔本報北平三日電〕宋院長在平談稱：政府必採有效措置，以安定物價，今年預算，決使收支平衡，盡量避免增發通貨。關於敵僞經營事業，其確爲有繼續價値者，如大沽新港等，政府必仍盡力使其完成。此項談話，係宋氏昨日下午在邀宴參政員席上發表，成舍我席中曾力言，國家應重視華北，並謂，北伐後縱不定都北平，而能重視，則九一八前後之歷史，當另是一番面目。蕭一山亦謂，明朝不遷都北平，即難有二百年天下，宋表示對北平重要性，具有同感。</p>

<p>「天津爲我國北方經濟重心，對外貿易亦居重要地位，大沽新港將來建築完成後，當更增加其重要性。此來爲視察並推進經濟復員，以及接收敵偽產業之處理等事項，的有三二日勾留，因難渝日久，待理之事務甚多，急須遄返也」。</p>

<p>〔聯合社東京四日電〕聯合國最高統帥麥克阿瑟今日發出兩項指令，命日政府肅淸一切超國家主義恐怖黨，　武主義團體，或任何社會曾欺騙及誘惑日本人民進行征服世界計劃者。此次麥師指令較前此所發各項指令已更進一步，期實行波茨坦宣言中之要求，即日本應脫離不負責任之軍閥束縛，爲其和平代價。此次指令在使日本新成立之各政黨及政府本身，由軍閥及封建勢力下護得解放，並使政府官吏不再畏欋秘密組織與恐怖黨工人之攻擊。麥帥命令取消之黨會計有二十七個，大半在政治上佔有勢力。其中包括大日本革新會·大東亞協會·黑龍會·黑詳會·東亞同盟及其他各種靑年組織在內·麥帥指令並禁止組織謀抵抗或反對佔領軍，或支持日軍閥對外侵略行動，排斥外人在日本經營工商業，提倡軍事或半軍事訓練，或主張成其他超國家主義計劃之任何政黨或會社。解散各機關之財產，由日政府沒收保管，各種檔案記錄，亦一律與以沒收，並公開發表，其一九三七年七月七日以來之全部會員，均應移交聯合國最高紡帥載落，幣原內閣明日上午十時召開緊急會議，討論麥帥肅淸日政府主戰分于之嚴峻命令。麥帥此項新政策，是否將使日內國因之而倒，尚無表示；但有閣員五人按照指令，將與撒職。東京報紙解　麥帥指令，謂此譽將給與日本產生新領袖。</p>
<p>扶植日本人民　傾向民主　使人復活增加力量</p>
<p>〔聯合社東京四日電〕麥帥今日指令中聲稱：「日本如欲安然樹立負責之政府，則任命新官吏，必須出以最大審愼態度。此次官吏應扶植日本人民之民主傾向，使之復活，增强力量，並將尊重根本人權及言論宗敎與思想自由」。受此項指令影響之人，究有多少，一時尚無統計，大的有數百人之譜。自特務警察以至內閣閣員，內務府官員，貴族院議員，凡指令內所規定者，均計算在內。不僅負責者將予免職，凡指令所及，議會候選人即將失去其候選資格，縣長或市長亦將免職。根據新指令，又有大批戰爭犯產生，包括元帥府，最高統帥部大本營等各軍事機關人員，財政及托殖會社官員在內，托殖會社共廿家包括南滿鐵道會社，南滿開發會社，華北開發會社，華中開發會社，及朝鮮信托會社等，其官員均包括在戰犯名單之內，俾與朝鮮，台灣，關東，南洋，荷印，馬來亞，法屬越南，緬甸，中國及滿洲各軍政府，行動一致。</p>
<p>統帥部主任談　麥帥命令　蘇京會議前即決定</p>
<p>〔聯合社東京四日電〕聯合國最高統帥部主任韋特奈副少將談稱：麥帥下令肅淸日本黷武份子，並非日本新管制計劃之結果。遠在莫斯科會議決定設立管制委員會及遠東委員會之前八星期，此項指令已在草擬中。今日公報中所涉及之各人為吾人佔領之初所遭遇根本問題之一。據報知新聞稱：日內閣並未自動執行一事，故麥帥頒發此項指令，實爲勢所必然，在理日內閣應當出以自動，日皇亦應注意國家新領袖問題，而於政府未經聯合國統帥以時示意之前，自動採取補究辦法。今日閣議時幣原因患感冒缺席。據聞指令送到已遲，未及譯出付議，故會議中僅討論新預算案云。</p>

<p>〔聯合社紐約四日電〕從一九四六年起，美國人將不會再感覺到物資的缺乏，父親們的白襯衫也許都已已穿舊，母親們也許還在等着買幾雙絲襪，小孩子仍舊穿着去年的睡衣，但這種情形，決不會再長久了。日用品的缺乏，已成過去。</p>
<p>美國工業界人士預測，一九四六年各項日用品的供給將逐漸增加。</p>
<p>一年以前，吃烟的人爲了買一包香烟，每天要跑出去　　，現在已可以隨便　到一盒你所歡喜的香烟了。</p>
<p>去年春天，肉類的供給極感缺乏，很多人家時常數日不知肉味，但自戰爭結束，軍隊中需肉漸少，肉的供給才開始　加。雜貨店裏已可以重見到繼頭食物。據商業部估計，在未來的幾個月中，或將有品質更好的聽頭食物，在市上出售。</p>
<p>無綫電及電器設備，也可在市塲上購買得到，這還是戰事以來破題兒第一次。全國製鞋業協會預料各鞋廠，即將有適當數量的皮鞋，供給美國民衆。小孩子的鞋子因需要太大，似乎一時還不够供應，但大人的鞋子，不論男女，則在一九四六年的夏天，無論如何，不會再有供不應求的現象。</p>
<p>一九四五年初，美國人每人手裏都拿着一本配給憑證，以備領購他所需要的物件。今年，除了糖以外，在他已可自由購買任何物品了。食糖是政府在戰時第一項實行配給的物品，這種配給或仍要戰續相當時間。朗巴食糖交易所所長曾預料，在一九四六年的春季，糖的供應恐）仍　很感缺少，必須過了四月一日又後，才始有轉佳的希望。</p>
<p>紡織物在去年一年內，無時不在缺乏之中，恐怕要到今年夏，才能除解這種恐慌。某廠商說。現在市上所買不到的被單和衴套等物，在二三個月內，即又可出現各商店極　之中，小孩子着的　衣內衣及棉織外套，三個月後即可有貨供應。</p>
<p>成人的衣着，如欲恢復到戰前的供給量，所需的時間，要較其他物品來得長久。數百萬解甲歸來的美國戰士，他門正需要添置新裝。</p>
<p>據美國內衣踵衣製造商協會發表，肉衣和睡衣的供應，要在六個月以後，始能改善。便服及大衣的產量，雖在不斷地增加，但依磊不數需要，因此製造商都希望能在今年把他們大部份的貨色，一齊批發給各商店，以應急需。</p>

<p>〔路透社紐倫堡四日電〕前希姆萊安全警察之領袖奧能道夫，昨在紐倫堡法庭於戈林等被告注視之下，詳述秘密警察之暴行。渠承認設計集團殺人，並目擊其執行。在其指導之下，有猶太男婦兒童九萬名，在蘇聯境內被殺，其中有槍殺於坦克車暫壕內及溝堅內者，有被送入蘇氣車者，靑氣車之說，乃爲減少婦孺死時精神上之痛苦，同時因德軍中不乏未婚者，亦可免其執行槍殺婦孺之不愉快的任務。送入毒氣車之人，並不感覺痛苦，此乃醫師所告渠者，但其部下多不願擔任出淸毒氣車之工作，彼等認爲此等工作，足以引起精神上不必要之紊亂。</p>

<p>〔聨合社倫敦四日電〕英國負責任當局某，其姓氏不願宣布，於最近宣稱：英政府已具有一種計劃，擬逐漸增强聯合國機構，而以世界政府爲其理想，非歷久不能實現，惟英政府相信聯合國機構最後應有單獨直接管理世界警察之權，各國應解除武裝至無一敢向世界警察挑戰爲止。英國閣員曾有種種理想，趨向合併現有各國之主權，即於今日亦已在計劃進行。外交家稱爲「技術範國」之步驟，所謂技術範圍，即各國政府爲人民執行之經濟社會方法，構成其大部份服務者是。按照此項計劃之大綱，將先提議成立一歐洲區聯合國機構，沿經濟與政治兩條路綫前進，以趨向組成太上國家之目的。英國所以着重早日成立一歐洲聯合國機構者，緣歐洲各國曾遭兵樊，創鉅痛深，或已準備沿「國際政府」之路綫疾進，並覺歐洲各國必須團結合作，以謀復興。此外並曾討論眞正國際管理交通·運輸·航空·衛生等事之具體計劃，創議者堅持此項機構，需在各洲設立分區辦事處，以調整各國政府行動，維持各會員國與聯合國間之密切聯絡。英外相貝文及外務次官諾爾具克最近曾公開宣言所謂「世界國會」，其意即在於此。英國感覺聯合國憲章，已爲普及全世界之法律與公道制度立下基礎，一如美國聯邦法律，其重要超出彼此矛盾之各州法律以上。</p>

<p>〔聯合社華盛頓三日電〕國務院應陸軍部之請求，已發表美國對德政策宣言，俾美國佔領軍當局有所遵循。自去年八月波茨坦三巨頭會議以來，任何强爾對德國一般政策加以詳細闡釋者，此尚第一次，此項宣言同時又分送參預佔領之蘇英法三國政府。美國官員不願預言三國反響如何，僅稱美國所擬政策，係假定德國能保有現行疆界，魯爾工業區及萊茵區俱包括在內。由此一端，恐即將遭法國反對，因法國力主上述兩地區必須自德國削去者。此項政策折衷「軟」「硬」兩派意見，其終極目的在希望一敗塗地之德國，能於二年後重行爲定經濟基礎，足以收支相抵，並提高其人民之生活標準，但欲達到此項目的，美國及其聯合國須供給資金或需數萬美元，俾德國得在今後二年內輸入必需物品·</p>
<p>使德恢復常態</p>
<p>須經三個時期</p>
<p>國務卿貝爾納斯復加補充說明稱，德國在恢復「正當狀態」前，須經過三個時期：第一時期至今年春季爲止，聯合國應達到下列四事，（一）防止德國發生大飢　，必要時得增加美國輸入品；（二）增加德國輸出之煤產，往前被德國所蓆捲諸國「至最大限度」；（三）於二月二日左右，完成四强賠款協定，並開始設立實施機構；（四）於財政。運輸。交通·國外貿易·及工業，分別建立德國管理機關。第二時期自今年春季至一九四八年二月二日爲止，可預期德國漸漸復元，除因賠款被拆移之工廠外，除者均可永歸德國保有，德國工業當可復活。至第三時期，德國將自行堂管經濟，僅受聯合國若干「殘餘限制」而已，德國工業將蒸蒸日上，可維持與歐洲其他各國相同之生活標準。據某官員　，按照此項政策推行，則德國旣非「漁樵農牧」之國，亦不能成爲第一等工業强國，能於二十五年中發動兩次侵略戰事者云。</p>

<p>我空軍在本國近代史上可說是一枝新銳的軍隊，牠的正式出生，正當「九一八」事變前後，而牠却在苦難的對日民族戰爭中，以年幼者的身份，堅毅的肩負起了拱衛祖國領空的艱鉅責任。　中國空軍自從二十六年「八一四」那天開始應戰，一直到日本接受無條件投降之日爲止，恰巧是八週年。八年來，牠由幼弱而成長，而健壯起來，由被動的地位而爭取到主動，由還擊而出擊，而親身經歷到這次抗日戰爭的勝利結束。這一串成長發展的過程，似乎値得向國人作一個總括的報告。</p>
<p>處女戰績　奠定空軍基礎</p>
<p>看第一天的戰績：中華民國二十六年八月十四日，是幼年的中國空軍開始參加對日抗戰的第一天。在這第一天，驅逐隊在杭州上空一舉擊落了敵機六架，造成了六比零的光榮紀錄。轟炸部隊冒着惡劣的氣候，一日之間出動十次，炸沉炸傷黃浦江吳淞口一帶的敵艦十餘艘，破壞上海區的敵軍營房倉庫軍需品不計其數。這就奠定了中國空軍益趨强大的最堅實最穩固的基礎。</p>
<p>一個最有名的第四驅逐大隊ｇ　我們稱他爲志航大隊的，在開戰後七天之內擊落了敵機六十架，打破在第一次歐戰時候英美德各國最有名的航空部隊的戰績紀錄。</p>
<p>初期對比　僅五十三與一</p>
<p>抗戰初起，二十六年暮夏到中秋，空軍的主要任務是拱衛苜都，警衛京滬綫，出擊上海戰區的敵艦陣地，協助地面戰友，嚴守防綫。可是，中國土地有那麼大，戰區遼闊，北迄山西察哈爾，南至廣束，那一處不需要空軍呢？九月間轟炸部隊的突襲南海敵艦隊，十一月間的長征塘沽，十月間驅逐部隊在太原擊落敵驅逐之王三輪寬，便是這一時期空軍遊動作戰的幾個實例。</p>
<p>這時，中國空軍在數量上佔劣勢，特別是飛機的缺乏，是無可諱言的。據倫敦泰晤士報的分析，這時期中國空軍和敵人的對比是一比五十三。</p>
<p>在這艱困苦中奮鬥了幾個月，二十六年十二月，隨着首都南京的撤守，中國空軍的戰績也暫時沉寂了下來。但是這沉寂並不是壞事，效是在補充，在訓練，中國空軍現在需要更進一步的加强自已的力量，更進一步的充實自已的裝術，準備來日給侵犯我神聖領空的空中强盜一個更嚴重的打擊。</p>
<p>空前大捷　奪回了制空權</p>
<p>著名的「二一八」之役，武漢上空在十二分鐘內擊落了敵機十二架，造成劃時代的空前大捷。這時成隊的銀色飛機掠頂而過，這些飛機，有的單翼，有的雙翼，全都是友邦蘇聯助貸給我們的當代第一流的新銳驅逐機：數量的大，性能的好，使我們在二十七年的春夏，確實奪回了制空權　同時期，轟炸部隊也從蘇聯友邦手裏得到大量的接濟，配備起最新銳的雙發動機的轟炸機來。二月二十三日轟炸台北，給了敵人一個意想不到的打擊，五月二十日的人道遠征，中國飛機成隊的若臨到日本本土上空，散下百萬張傳單，在戰略政略上，都發揮了最大的效果。尤其値得一提的是，二十七年夏天爲了保衛武漢發動的揚子江上的連續空襲。</p>
<p>困難重重　倚仗西北路綫</p>
<p>武漢撤退，軍政中心移至重慶以後，空軍所遭遇的困難便比較的多。爲了充實本身的戰鬥力量，空軍需要補充器材和訓練作戰人員。長江交通被切斷以後，器材來源，主要要靠西北國際路綫。你會想像得到，駕駛着陌生的飛機，在陌生的國際路綫上，飛越數千里荒漠無人的大沙漠，氣候是惡劣的，變化莫測的，她面上找不到一些路標，光是把善心的友邦在邊境上移交給我們的飛機接取回來，已經是超乎尋常的困難了；何况在訓練補充的時期，在旅途上，也還是在不斷的相機打擊着敵人。</p>
<p>敵大編隊　侵入我大後方</p>
<p>二十九年，德國在歐洲戰塲上，憑藉空中暴力一鼓滅亡了許多弱小國家。日寇受到了這事實上的敎訓，妄想效覺，企圖以杜黑主義消滅我們的戰鬥意志，自春至秋，不斷的用着一百餘架的大總隊羣，來轟炸我抗戰中心的陪百重慶，間或也用比較小董的機羣來騷擾我大後方的其他各重要都市。等到六月間，長江咽喉重地宜昌失陷以後，敵人的機羣便以宜昌爲前進基地，隨時侵襲各路，空防情勢更加惡劣起來。道時，我們空中的警衛部隊，正處在萬分艱困的環境當中，然而我們驅逐隊的健兒們，仍舊憑了大無畏的精神，竭盡所能，與敵人相周旋。</p>
<p>在這同時期裏，轟炸部隊也沒有放棄己的責任。雖然飛機數量不多，戰續却並不差。</p>
<p>這之後，自二十九年冬天到三十年上半年，空軍的消息又沉寂下來了。這時，盟友美國本來答應給我們大量飛機器材的接濟的，但因爲滇緬路曾有一個時期的封鎖，而無法運輸進來；更加日寇乘法國戰敗之後，一舉佔領越南，我們西南各地所受到的空襲次數，漸次增多起來。原來數量就很少的驅逐部隊，此刻一分散應用，實力自然更加感到薄弱。這時期，二十九年下半年到三十年上半年，或許是比較黑暗的一個時期。然而這黑暗紙是黎明之前的短暫現象，黑暗衝破，緊接着黎明就來了。</p>
<p>入新階段　解除敵機威脅</p>
<p>從三十年下半年起，就是中國空軍抗戰進人新階段後，制空權不是又奪回來了麼？自此以後，整個中國戰塲上的領空，不是比過去任何一個時期掌握得更穩固麼？此後幾年來，除去極少數的地方，極偶然的事例而外，全國同胞大都不再受敵機的威脅，不再受空襲的擾亂了。</p>
<p>這時期，一切形勢在好轉。首先是大量飛機器材，從美國運進中國內地來。緊接着中國空軍美志願隊在昆明成立，和我們並肩作戰，担負起保護西南國際路綫的任務。再之後，三十年十二月八日美日大戰爆發，美國給我們的物質的精神的帮助，都比較以前更加積極了；陸上運輸不及，再加上當中運輸，從此我們不再是單獨作戰，而是整個對抗軸心侵略戰爭中的一員了。</p>
<p>這時以後，我驅遂部隊已變成了空中的遊擊隊，敵機飛到那裏，我們就追擊到那裏，日寇空軍實力日漸削弱，我大後方的空防日益鞏固，此後牠再也不敢冒險進犯了。</p>
<p>美航空隊　正式在華成立</p>
<p>時令進人三十二年，中國的空軍戰鬥行動開始步入一個嶄新的黃金時期。</p>
<p>首先應該感謝美國盟友的幫助，三十二年三月十日，美國陸軍第十四航空隊正式在華成立，與中國空軍比　作戰。器材方面，美國根據租借法案，竭盡全力供應着我們；我們的空軍部隊已漸次裝備起美製第一流的新銳飛機，取得了空中戰爭的絕對優勢。訓練方面，盟友也在利用他優良的環境，優良的設備和技術，替我們分担着辛勞，許多批數最優秀的中國飛行學生，在美國陸軍航空根據地受訓完成以後，立即遄返祖國，走上空中戰塲。</p>
<p>由於我空軍實力的增强，在戰績上也表現得特別光輝燦耀。</p>
<p>這一年來，驅逐部隊卻因了敵寇的畏縮不前，在防禦方面不能一顯身手，便勇毅地不斷出擊，担負起進攻的任務來。除了經常掩護轟炸部隊出發作戰，也隨時自行携帶小型炸彈巡弋在戰陣上空，俯衝炸射地面的敵軍以及車輛船隻供應品，和投送彈藥給養被敵圍住的地面部隊。而其中最震驚世界，膾炙人口的戰績，則是本年五月卅一日臧錫蘭上尉在敵陣上空冒險急救盟友艾立生中校，和六月六日周志開少校在梁山基地上空單機擊落敵機一小隊三架，這兩件最英雄的事跋，前者是證實了中國空軍軍人俠義爲懷捨命全交的傳統的崇高德性。後者是說明了空軍士氣依舊奮發，技術上依舊是以寡敵衆。</p>
<p>空中武力　中美混合組成</p>
<p>除了美國駐華的第十四航空隊以外，在中國戰塲上另一支强大的空中武力——中美空軍混合團，也在三十二年十一月六日正式成立了。這是一支純攻擊性的空單，她擁有最新式的大量飛機，由中美兩國飛行員混合組成。該團成立後的第一功，即爲與美第十四航空隊奇襲合灣日軍基地——新築機塲，和實行東南海沿岸的掃蕩轟炸，在最初五十日內所擊沉的敵艦船，即達三萬噸之多。</p>
<p>集中出擊　戰局頓見穏定</p>
<p>從三十三年初夏一直到暮冬，確是中國戰塲上情勢最為惡劣的一個時期。敵人遠從僞滿調來精銳的關東大軍，在中原戰塲湘桂戰塲作着垂死前的掙扎，妄想打通所謂『大陸交通錢』，以減少牠在太平洋上所受盟軍進攻的威脅。</p>
<p>首先敵人發動中原戰事，以打通平漢綫爲其主要目的，我們不否認在初期戰鬥中，敵人着着進展；但自從四月廿八日我空軍集中完畢開始出勤之日起，戰局立時穩定了下來。</p>
<p>志航大隊　創造全勝鬥史</p>
<p>衡陽孤軍之所以能堅守四十七日，要亦得力於空軍的有力支援。更値得誇耀的是，在支援衡陽守軍的戰鬥中，空軍志航大隊創造了兩次屬於殲滅戰類型的全勝的戰鬥。</p>
<p>與志航大隊作戰同時，空軍第五大隊擔任着湖南戰區的戰略任務，從五月初以至八月底，出動到一千五百次之多。</p>
<p>新機接濟　養成長征空軍</p>
<p>去年是中國空軍面臨整個民族抗戰勝利結束的一年。</p>
<p>鄂北豫西南的會戰，湘西我軍基地的爭奪戰，桂柳南寗的反攻戰，是這一年內中國戰塲軍事上的幾件大事，我空軍不但積極參加，而且發揮出了牠驚人的威力</p>
<p>湘酉局勢轉危爲安，桂境國軍反攻着着進展，空軍第二大隊便肩負起策應地面陸軍作戰的任務</p>
<p>此外，去年春初，我空軍驅逐部隊，又由盟友美國手中，獲得了一批新式遠程飛機的接濟，養成了幾支强大有力的長征部隊；因此在爲敵佔領多年的華北華中地區各大都市和軍事據點，也普遍受到我機的襲擊，給了敵人以致命的創傷。戰績比較顯著的是：五征武漢，四襲京滬，一炸大沽口油池，一毀太原兵工廠。</p>
<p>建國時期　迅建空防部隊</p>
<p>叙述了中國空軍的奮戰史，我們認定中國空軍在抗戰八年中，扮演了一個功業不朽的主角：但國人不應以此爲滿意，世界已進入航空時代，我們要趕得上時代，我們要在建國期中鞏固我國家的强固地位，我們就得建立起新的國防隊伍，我們必得以全國同胞的力量，協助政府發揚已往的空軍光榮戰績，建設起一支更强大更有力的空軍。</p>

<p>再則行政長官公署下，設有貿易公司，專理統制物品之進出口事項。現下無論何物，運入均無限制，但鼓勵輸入者，僅食糧及肥料兩種。出口絕對禁止者爲米，因本年本省所產之米，尚不足地方所需要之民食，故鼓勵輸入而禁止輸出。可以米糧及肥料相交換者爲糖。凡冰糖方糖均不得自由出口，而須向台灣貿易公司請求按値交換。半統制者為煤，煤之產量較前低減，故本省各項公用·公營·以及工廠，均需煤孔急，故必須加以限制，並非絕對禁止出口。但以事實而論，煤之輸出，除俟將來航運發達之後，實亦無利可圖，因煤價每噸雖僅台幣二百元，（的合國幣四五十元，）但黑市水脚每噸須五千元，（國幣十餘萬，）若更以僞鈔計之，每噸達二三千萬矣。</p>
<p>關於台灣貿易公司之內容，記看尚無詳盡之考察，故暫置不論，食糧肥料與糖交換價格之如何厘訂，以及貿易公司之能吾如當局者所言之不與民爭利，涓滴歸公，取之於民者還之於民，一時尚無從加以論列也。</p>
<p>大員娶妓作妾　掛名秘書</p>
<p>再則尚有可爲國人告者：此處接收工作，亦頗見紊亂，或謂尚不如國內之甚，中央特派人員與長官公署方面之傾軋爭競，凡利之所在，往往趨之若驚。記者所聞所見之怪事，不一而足，某中央大員利用日人辦理接收，曾　出大笑話。關於吏治方面，亦有種種花樣。某大。娶妓作妾，掛秘書名義，居然走馬上任，但已受撤職查辦之處分。亦有爲好跳舞而受行政長官申斥者，種種不一而足。公務人員私生活之不能盡如人意，或給予台人一種疑惑與輕視之機會，亦屬無席爲諱之事實。但聞行政長官陳儀頗有整飭吏治，勵精求治之心。濡筆至此，於無限感慨中告一段落。</p>
<p>社論</p>
<h3 id="c42">中外人士的陳腐觀念 <a href="#c42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>中國軍民，熬了八年艱苦，打了八年血仗，暴敵屈膝，慶祝勝利，也已有了四個半月，中國應該是一個獨立自主的新國家了。不平等條約廢除，聯合國機構即將成立，無論在戰時在戰後，中國不但是民主國家陣營中的一員，而且是所謂四强或五强之一，中國尤其應該是一個獨立自主的新國家了。然而奇怪的很，官塲中，社會上，竟還在不知不覺中，流露出很多刺眼的行動，好像中國還是一個次殖民地的國家，還是和沒有出過力，打過仗，流過血以前一樣。尤其上海這個都市，百年恥辱史上所謂五口通商的十里洋塲，頤指氣使的洋大班，卑躬屈膝的買辦，在今天無形中還觸目皆是。說不定，有若干到中國來得稍久的友邦人士，還有些民族優越感在心中作祟；而中國人在百年受辱之餘，也難免一部分還有若干自卑癥結。這兩種心理因素攪在一起，遂發生許多可以痛心的事實。我們爲新中國的建設計，爲眞正增進中外邦交友誼計，必須廊淸若干中外人士的陳腐觀念。</p>
<p>隨便舉幾個例吧：譬如，去年舊金山會議時，中國言語文字曾經列爲通用語文之一，可見在中國國內，公文書用中國語文更是天經地義。爲便於國際往還計，附具譯文，講些洋話，原無不可。但若說中國官塲和社會，必須以能說洋話懂洋文者纔够格，殊可不必。前些時，有某外人撰文，妄事批評，竟說某官不諳英語，條件不够，這已是奇怪萬分，而居然還有中國人言談之間，也隨聲附和。那末，試問歐美各國通商大埠的官長是否都懂華文？又如：善後救濟工作，爲便利向友邦接洽計，多多延攬專才，尤其物色長於外國語文的人參與其事，原是理所當然。但如外間所傳，說什麼外國人不能相信我們中國官場，尤其不能相信地方政府，故必頻事事脫離政府的現有機構，處處另起爐灶辦理，甚至施賑散財，布恩市惠，都必須仰仗外人，也未免自視太不値錢。如果充滿這種心理，流弊所屆，勢必使社會仍成爲買辦當令的社會，中國人民仍停滯於仰承洋大班鼻息的階段。</p>
<p>聽說敵僞產業處理局在上海封有倉庫中，最近檢獲一批報紙計二三百筒，—據海軍司令部的人以前說，總數的有二千餘筒，究竟責數若干，處理局尚未公布，—行將分配售給報館，以救紙荒，而居然有什麼瑞典人出來，說這些紙是他向日本人買去的，主權應屬於他。因此，處理局竟把配售躭延下來。我們要問：在敵偽統制上海紙張的時候，那一個日本人可以出售紙張？如其在八月十日以後，瑞典人更憑什麼有可以從日本人手裏買紙的權利？這些事情，我們不能只因爲牽涉了一個洋人，就把該追問明白的不問。</p>
<p>最不可解的，莫如最近法艦白爾丁號竟擅載人犯離滬，却諉稱法總領事仍握有領事裁判權。照這樣說法，簡直法國官吏到今天似乎還不曾以平等待我。我們回想，抗戰八年中，法國對我怎麼樣，眞够痛心的了。貝當的維琪政府和德古的安南政府，怎樣幫助日寇侵略中國。它封鎖滇越路，它和日寇訂的斷送安南，使日寇把安南作爲襲攻滇桂和南侵太平洋的跳板，中國人眞是寒天吃冷水，點點在心頭。它怎樣在上海和敵僞勾結，欺壓中國善良的人民，上海市民應該不曾忘懷。今天的法國政府，旣與我國簽訂平等新的，縱說一時尚未簽字，難道法國還想在中國擺出舊時帝國主義的惡魔面孔，逞强奪理，損害中國的主權麼？如果眞這樣想，難怪赫爾利將軍要說遠東還有若干帝國主義者存在着呢！中國不想佔人家便宜，但至少中國今天不應再向人家無故低頭。明智的法國政府，和有遠見的法國人士，我們相信也一定不會再讓這些陳腐觀念，永遠迷住了他們少數落伍者的心胸。</p>
<p>還有最要不得的，上海有一部分人，在日寇覇佔時候，中外人士吃靈苦頭，到今天似乎都有些遣忘了，反而對勝利後的中國政府，多所苛責，求全之毀，愈來愈大。照他們這些人的想法，難道還願意再請日寇來把我們宰割統治！請大家捫心問問吧：淪陷時期的上海，市民的食衣住行如何？外僑的起居生活如何？今天在國民政府和上海市政府管理之下，無論怎樣不如你們的意，米糧總够吃了，布總有得買了，房子總不必再爲敵人拆毀或强佔了，走路總不必再化買路錢了。這兩三月來的上海，只聽得「上海人」「重慶人」這些怪話，但我們要知道，依附敵人的漢奸或準漢奸，決不能因其爲「上海人」而可以僥倖寬恕，允不能因其也會夾在「上海人」一羣裹罵駕「重慶人」，就可搖身一變而爲忠貞不貳的大丈夫。</p>
<p>我們須認淸一件大事，就是：中國今天是獨立自主的新國家了，中國今天是與世界上任何國家立於平等地位的新國家了。這個獨立平等自主的國際地位，離開次殖民地已不止十萬八千里。我們萬不能再把百年來次殖民地的奴隷思想，束縛我們自己！我們更須將爭取獨立平等自主的大功，歸之於八年熬苦抗戰的軍民，而這領導抗戰爭取勝利的乃是我們所擁護的國民政府。</p>

<p>烚赤昨初開尚稱穩定，但因封關期中預期之掛牌問題未見實現，多方紛紛了結，買氣遂遭挫折，以致最高價八一萬五後，始終供過於求，惟中途在八〇萬關口頗費掙扎，終以美鈔每况愈下，午刻浮多潰散，謠傳美滙掛牌自一千元至一千六分四級，工廠原料所需定一千二之說，賣氣突熾，曾見七七萬七左右，午後則徘徊於七八萬五前後，結果較封關前跌一萬九，銀樓飾金掛八萬四，紋銀六百元，銀元徘徊於四百三左右，暗折以需用稍繁，站定於一角左右。</p>
<p>美鈔因封關期中，各小錢莊門市收入為數頗鉅，實貨傾售，掛牌又未見實行，人心本已不振，自晨初一四三五元後，逐步下降，午刻又有美滙掛牌分一千至一千六四級，工廠正當需要定在第二級爲一千二之謠，遂破一千四關，降至一千三百八以下，午後漸形穩定，結果蛟去年底回小三十元，巷幣因該地申滙報昇，賣戶稍湧，由堅轉疲，結果老貨跌五元，新貨小四元。</p>
<p>公債仍多銀錢業游資活動，丙種曾哄至八八〇高價，業中人逢高出籠，午刻略起回風，由結果較對關前好三十元至九十元不　　華股以有常局干涉之空氣，初時突見怯疲，新光曾退至五十元內，永紗低至八三〇元，美亞六二〇元內，大戶釜底抽薪，近午漸漸拉上，午刻證券帮再來哄抬，又見堅俏，永紗升至九百三〇元，美亞迫至七百元關，最後逢高略有獲利了結者，稍見回頭，業中有一部份游資有轉入金市傾向，趨勢遂呈恍惚，結果較去年各冷門股亦因游資取捨不一，而現榮辱互見之象。，外股扔門續有漲高，冷門則稍形衰落，惟大體依然漲多於跌，結果較封關前怡紗升五十元，怡啤七十元，紙業八十五元，亞洲升三十元，英聯五十元，墾植二十元，尚是買價，各橡皮股續見進展。</p>

<p>米市消化依然平淡，貨主雖堅，但欲振無力，市勢與年底收盤彷彿，惟秈米貨稀，略見挺秀，麵粉閩帮接辦，市趨穩固，油市店方乘巧納取，疲而轉挺，回漲數百元，黃豆略帶緊勢，豆餅南洋續辦，形勢仍活，價格微升，生仁冬令銷路頗旺，再升千元，酒市牢立。</p>

<h3 id="c49">上海之搪瓷業 <a href="#c49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>搪瓷爲琺瑯之俗名，其發明於何時何地，不能確知，十九世紀宋葉，德奧諸開始有琺瑯工業，其後美國研究此項工業異常努力，進步極速，日本於明治四十一二年間始提倡斯業，至第一次世界大戰時最稱發達，我國景泰藍發明甚早，而眞正之有搪瓷業，則民國以來之事也。</p>
<p>上海搪資業之歷史，綜計先後不過三十年，而其發達情形，實足驚人，回憶民國初年，姚慕蓮諸氏創辦中華美術琺瑯公司，聘請留奧工程師劉達三君主其事，開辦未幾，即遭歐戰之打擊，原料不能輸入，遂亦無法開工，故未有出品聞世，劉見無所成就，乃與劉東靑等改組中華美術琺瑯公司爲鍺豐搪瓷公司，設廠開工，模仿日本，漸有出品，此爲上海正式有搪瓷廠之始，方上海搪瓷廠之初創也，幾乎全部原料，皆從國外輸入，所謂搪瓷廠者，不過加工製成而已，至民國十三四年間，雖有自製琺瑯之法，然成績尚平庸，不及洋貨遠甚，及國民革命軍奠定上海，諸搪瓷廠家已有相當基礎，新廠亦相繼設立，從此逐年皆有進步，營業自亦隨之發達，故以實銷言之，國產搪瓷占第一位，舶來品幾乎絕跡，挽回利益，誠非淺尠，自全面抗戰發生以後，格於環境，集中人材，添辦原料，殊非易易，故未有　發展可言，迨太平洋戰事爆發後，遂全部陷於停頓狀態中，直至勝利消息傳來，義生搪瓷廠首先全部復工，其出品精良更勝於前，日常搪瓷用品，幾乎莫不具備，稍後九豐久新兩家亦相繼復工焉，</p>
<p>搪瓷器的可分爲數類：</p>
<p>（一）家庭用之中空搪瓷器</p>
<p>（二）化學用之搪瓷器</p>
<p>（三）蒸汽用及其他之　資管</p>
<p>（四）水管及其漏水用之搪瓷管</p>
<p>五）搪瓷招牌</p>
<p>其中用度最廣者厥爲第一項，種類繁多，如面盆（可分爲平邊翻口深形捲邊等數種），痰盂（可分爲瓶形柿形及普通等），鍋子（包括飯鍋湯鍋等），口杯（普通及機製），水桶，便器，洗衣盆，茶盤，菜盆，飯碗，咖啡壼，燉酒壼，火油爐，水吊，皂缸及各色花素食籃等等，幾乎各種家庭用具，搪瓷皆有之，以其輕便淸潔耐用，爲現代化家庭所樂用，而原來之用具反被漸漸淘汰矣。</p>
<p>搪瓷之爲用，旣如是之廣，而上海完備之搪瓷廠，却寥寥無幾，茲將加入公會之諸臨，以其創辦年代之先後，分列於左：</p>
<p>廠名　廠址　經理</p>
<p>鑄豐　檳榔路　童季通</p>
<p>益豐　梵皇渡　董吉甫</p>
<p>中華　小沙渡路　方劍閣</p>
<p>華豐　馬白路　李直士</p>
<p>久新　薩坡賽路　錢宗建</p>
<p>九豐　赫德路　徐朗星</p>
<p>義生　康腦脫路　吳璜祥</p>
<p>以上諸家，皆爲股份有限公司組織，此外未入公會者尚有大新大豐光華成豐和豐南華等十餘家</p>
<p>我國工業向稱落後，而搪瓷業則為例外，二十餘年來突飛猛晉，有菲業外所能想像者，日人之侵奪我國商塲，無所不用其極，而於搪瓷業，獨無挿足之餘地，此亦足以自慰者。（楊康年）</p>

<p>— 黃垂慶</p>
<p>抗戰期間，閩省西北各地因地位較處安全，各地內遷學校多覓此爲臨時棲址，而政府爲適應各項需要起見，其他專科學校也在此應運而生。福建高等敎育素向落後，唯因此一來乃一躍而為東南各省之冠。綜計八年間，內遷學校凡四，國立曁南大學，國立東南聯大（據已併英士大學），國立中正醫學院，江蘇學院。新設專校凡五，國立音樂專科學校，國立海疆海陸空校，省立農學院，省立醫學院，省立師範專科學校。連該省原有之國立厦門大學，私立華南女子文理學院，私立福建學校，私立協和大學四校在內，全省專科以上學校計達十二所之多。彼等多散處於閩西北療癘之區，外則高山業叢，耳目不開，內則房舍不全，設備貧乏。長年累月惟與疾病自然相搏鬥，其間員生所歷痛苦，殊非三筆墨所能形容。抗戰勝利之後，各校率有變動，茲爲供求各方明瞭起見，特將歷年來各校分佈設備槪况豐其今後復員計劃，擇要叙述於下：</p>
<p>一，國立院校概況</p>
<p>（一）國立厦門大學：抗戰甫起，該校即奉命撤至閩西長汀，所有圖書儀器故均完整無缺。自薩本棟氏接長後，校務進展甚速。東南各省靑年，紛紛投其懷抱，該校聲譽亦因此蒸蒸日上。全校計設文，理，法，商四學院，其中以理學院辦理成績最佳。現有學生二千餘人，敎授百餘員。本年度薩校長因公辭職，遺缺即由該校理學院院長洼德耀氏接充。校址確定仍爲厦門，一年級新生經已先期趕厦報到上課。全校人員預定今年七月前全部遷瓤長汀。</p>
<p>（二）國立暨南大學：太平洋戰事發生後，該校全部撤退至閩，校址即權且擇就閩北建陽城郊之童遊鄉。當初設備極形簡陋，經校長何炳松氏數年來積極改進，始具規模。全校計設文，理，商三學院，擁有學生一千三百餘人。戰事結束後，該校永久校址曾盛傳移設汕頭，藉以便利閩粵各地僑生，後以各方校友要求，故乃成罷論，現已決定遷京，惟校舍未建就以前，今夏暫遷上海原址上課。</p>
<p>（三）國立音樂科學校：成立於民國卅一年秋，原爲福建省音樂師資人員訓練所，後擴展成爲國立專校。校址在閩戰時省會所在地—永安吉山。設本科及師範科兩種，科之下另分理論，作曲，樂章，管絃國樂諸組。歷屆校長為蔡繼琨，廬前，梁龍光，張兆煥諸氏，現則由名製曲家唐學詠氏接任。學生人數約二百左右，外籍敎授亦有多名，校內樂器設備頗健全，學生活動能力頗佳。戰後聞遷於南京。</p>
<p>（四）國立海疆學校：三十三年秋，中央為培養戰後建設臺灣及其他海疆人才計，特命張兆煥氏來閩籌設該校。終於短期間內籌備完竣，擇定仙游為校址，立即開始招生。（去年，敎部委梁龍光氏接長，梁氏因鑒於當地不易發展，乃改遷閩南南皮之九都。）該校規模頗龐大，計劃中設有行政，師範，技藝，特種班四科，科下另設組。目前行政科僅招民政，敎育二組。師範科設文史，公民訓育兩組（按本期編制變更，改辦法商，師範二年制五年制兩種。）學生以閩南人爲主，待遇一切由校供給，故招考人數異常踴躍。戰後校址，聞決定設在臺記。</p>
<p>（五）國立中正醫學院：該院原在江西，前歲贛南渝陷，忽卒遷至長汀上課，設有醫藥二科。去年英大醫學院併入後，學生人數增達三百人左右。現即將遷返江西</p>
<p>二，私立院梭一班</p>
<p>（一）私立協和大學：爲敎會所辦，成立於民初，校址在福州附近之魁歧，校舍踞山臨海，極具壯觀。抗戰以後，轉輾遷至閩北邵武上課。全校計設文，理，農三院。學生計八百餘人。校長爲林景闊氏。該校功課嚴緊，讀書研究風氣均濃厚，辦理成績尤爲各私立學校之冠。本學期邵武一部分校舍，突告焚燬，損失頗鉅，現因邵武鼠疫猖獗，全校於去年十一月廿五日提前結束，即日遷移。今春即可返抵原址開學云。</p>
<p>（二）私立華南女子文理學院：亦為敎所辦，戰前設於福州會前山。民二十七年遷於南平。沒有外文，家事，化學生物四系。學生的二百餘人。院長王世靜女士，早歲留學英美。其他敎授亦多係碩學女儒。學風沉豐檏素，音樂設備甚佳。茲悉該校於去年底結束，本期遷返福州。</p>
<p>（三）私立福建學院：該校成立於民國元年，前身爲福建法政專門學校，民二十年始改今名。原址在福州白水井，戰時移設閩淸白雲渡。設有法律，政治，經濟三系，擁有學生四百餘人。院長爲郭公木氏，董事長則爲閩省鉅紳陳培錕先生。校友遍佈全閩，頗通力合作。本年六月福州重光，該院率先遷返原址，爲國內各校復員最先者。</p>
<p>（四）江蘇學院：係戰區長官部收留各地流亡學子而設，前身爲蘇皖技專及蘇皖政治學院。後與安徽學院分立，改爲今名。校址三十二年間，由崇安遷至三元。院長爲載克光氏，董事長則爲顧祝同先生。內設外文，政治，經濟，數理，機械工程，文史，行政管理七科，計有學生四百七十餘人。年來該院辦理成績卓著，造就東南各省靑年不少。現校址已擇定揚州，今年即可遷移。</p>
<p>三，閩省新設院校</p>
<p>（一）省立師範專科學校：成立於民國二十九年，校址在南平水南。設有國文，史地，數理化，敎育，體育，藝術七科，目的在培養全省中等師資人材。比年以來，各屆畢業學生服務成績均甚優良，該校校譽因之提升。現任校長爲林希謙氏（閩臨參會參議長），擁有學生四百餘人。校址經勘定在福州烏石山，上學期於十二月十五日結束，本期全部在榕上課。</p>
<p>（二）省立醫學院：成立於民國二十六年，校址在沙縣縣城。內全部爲醫科，修業期間六年。現有學生四百左右，設備尚稱完善。學生研究風氣頗佳，敎部歷屆舉辦成績考核，該院均名列前茅。新定校址福州吉祥山，不久即可遷移。</p>
<p>（三）省立農學院：成立於民國廿九年，校址在永安黃曆，設有園藝，病虫，森林諸系，現有學生二百餘人。校址問題，學生堅持欲遷往福州，唯該省政府因恐將來閩西一帶敎育機關過度貧缺，尚未照准。</p>
<p>閩省人士，爲紀念故林主席起見，議將此省立三校合徘爲國立林森大學，現正多方請求中，預計不久將來當可實現云。</p>
<p>東華本屆自得劉顯漢宋靈聖鄭英權三劍客加入，陣容可謂已臻理想，蘇聯有前滬警蘇壳爾等隊之名將，實力尚可，今遇東華，勢必出其全力以赴。又據賈幼良云，出塲人馬大致如下：</p>

<p>積極推行全市體育</p>
<p>〔本市訊〕上海市敎育局根據敎育部頒布之省市國民體育委員會組織通則，設置上海市國民體育委員會，該會組織除由本市社會局，財政局，衛生局，警察局，工務局，民政處，警備總司令部各派代表一人與敎局各處處長秘書及督學一人充任外，並由敎育局長聘請體育專家十五人至十七人充任之。昨日下午二時，該會在市敎局大禮堂宣告成立。茲將開會情形錄下：</p>

<h3 id="c66">法艦擅載戰犯出口　中法友誼受影響　市計公表抗議原文　各界主採有效措施　法總領事竟表示左右為難 <a href="#c66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本埠法領館警察擅自逮捕法籍納粹份子卡可平諾，並於三日不顧我國抗議，逕將私押該犯之輕巡洋艦白爾了號啓椗離滬後，已引起中外各界之密切注意。記者頃訪外交部駐滬辦事處秘書呂懷君，承告關於此事之全部案卷，業已彙呈重慶，現正靜候外交部之決定。呂氏稱：駐滬法軍共約四千人，法僑約六百人，該法艦來滬之前，曾依法向市府報告，謂此來任務即爲撤兵撤僑，而不意其竟有此違法押解人犯之舉。記者旋自本市外交界方面探悉，此次事件，如不獲適當解次，則以後法國艦輪來滬，或將遭遇困難，而中法邦交及貿易，恐亦將蒙受不良影響。甚至本市法領事館，亦有被封閉之可能。</p>
<p>市府抗議義正詞嚴</p>
<p>市政府對卡可平諾一案，向駐滬法總署提出之抗議原文，已於昨日發表。該抗義書內稱：「查各國在華領事裁判權，已經一律廢止。貴國駐華大使曾經通知我國外交部，謂已飭令駐滬總領事館立卽封閉領事法庭在案。乃本府近據報告總領事館竟有自行逮捕駐滬法國納粹人民保羅佛朗梭卡可平諾杜蘇里等，並擬於最近期間，將該卡可平諾交最近泊滬之法國兵艦，送回法國等情，常告貴總領事以此種舉動，對治外法權之撥除，顯係有意破壞，我國政府自應嚴予禁止。業於本月一日函請我外交部駐滬辦事處提出嚴重抗議，要求將上述人犯，交由我國司法機關依法處理去後，茲准該處滬二（三五）字第二號公函，略稱：「　經本處據以備就嚴重抗議書一件，由呂秘書於卽日下午四時，面致法國駐滬總領事，除得其允諾，於日內作書面答復外，據其口頭答稱：該總領事館確曾依據法舊約所規定之領事裁判權，自行逮捕法團納粹人民卡可平諾一名，菜於本日依照法國法律，將其押囚於停泊之法國兵艦，將於明後日由該艦駛運返國。茲旣據得本處關於此案之抗議，願即電法國駐華大使請示。等由過府。後查本案前准貴總領事館三十四年十二月七日函，略開：「法國政府擬於短期內，遣派兵艦一艘，駛來上海，並於上海西貢間經過數次，以爲陸續撤退駐滬法國陸軍及若子法國僑民，未悉貴市長方面，對於此項計劃之實行，有否異議，希即示知」等由，經即電准找國外交部巧電開：「政府已令法艦來滬，任務以撤兵撤僑爲限」等語，並已函復貴總領事查明在卷。此項兵船，旣限於撤兵撤僑，今竟押運人犯，顯已超越應有任務之範圍以外。現此案貴總領事旣允即電貴國駐華大使請示，在未妥善解決以前，聽請聽知該兵船，暫緩出口，否則其一切後果，應由貴總領事負完全責任，相應函請查照爲荷」。</p>
<p>社團主張嚴重交涉</p>
<p>我國外交州局，對本完極爲重視，嚴重交涉，將在重　上海兩地分別展開，務期獲得滿這之解決。外交部駐滬辦事處現已準備於重慶覆電到滬之後，　據外部訓示，向法當局繼續交涉，此間各界之社團，亦均紛紛集義，　促政府，向法方提出强硬交涉，幷採有効措置。以維我國主權法權之完整。據係方面宣稱：卡可平　之罪行，與已被絞決之英奸哈哈爵士頗，類似，渠於敵僞寬盤期間，除廿供驅使爲敵人搜集情報，幷在納粹電台，充任播音員，作不利於聯合國之歪曲宣傳。</p>
<p>法總領事自承生疏</p>
<p>關於法艦白爾丁號偷戰法奸卡可平諾離滬赴西貢審訊事，殊屬藐視我方主權，引起此間一般人士之注意。記者特於昨午走訪法駐滬總領事費禮浩，詢以一切，費氏承認該艦確於三日晨九時五十分離黃浦江駛西貢，艦長費利浦中將負責該艦之一切行動，法奸卡可平諾亦由該艦解押西貢，費氏對於此事件之發生，表示非常遺憾，但稱；彼方於一個半月前自巴黎來此，對於處理此項事件，極感生疏。</p>
<p>法國政府竟無指示</p>
<p>但時至今日，尚未接得法政府方面關於中國廢除領事裁判權之通知，更未接得法政府對於處置在滬法奸之指示。中國交部駐滬辦事處曾兩度提出交涉。費氏自稱，有左右爲難之感。記者再詢費氏對避免如此種事件之再度發生有何辦法，法領事稱：此乃可一不可再之事，將來必禁止其再發生，以免損害中法兩國邦交。昨晨此間中英文報紙，均以大標題報告事由始末，法領事認爲此乃非常公平之報道。又記者詢費氏以外傳法方尚保留有法奸數人未移交中國之事確否，彼極力否認，並稱：怯方所捕之法奸，只有卡可平諾一人而已。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕從事工業靈二十年之　西國氏，抗戰後在大後方離設工廠，貢獻國家至爲鉅大。此次回滬，備受各防面歡迎。據胡氏語記者，謂來滬後深覺上海各工臘，　壇速復員開工，以減輕嚴重之失業問題，後方各工廠，因協助抗戰而建立，復因勝利突然來臨而相繼崩潰，政府勵負經濟上救濟之責，爲之解決困難，使此輩忠誠之工業家，得從新參加未來的工業建設。中國工業無分前後方，是整個的，不可自己再來分化，致减少力量。工業化過程前途至爲艱鉅，全國工業界當合力共謀發展，如環境上各種條件不能配合，欲求謀一個工廠之獨自繁榮，是萬不可能之事。外匯結價問題，關係工業生死存亡，重慶工業界曾邀集專家座談商討多次，僉主進出口及定購機器，外匯結價應有所區別，蓋中國工業幼稚，不能不採取特別方式，至於外人投資合作及技術合作，中國工業家多數表示贊同，惟希望政府予以有力之主持。本人忝爲中國全國工業復員委員會主任委員，一俟上海工業復員，再度進展後，當往他埠或返渝復命。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕交迪部上海電信局長郁秉堅自接收電信局以來，積檯整頓，昨據種氏談：</p>
<p>商用電話暫難修竣</p>
<p>查本局自接收敵　華中電通信公司以來，積　極整理，，惟因各處電話綫路，經久失修，不　　用，有時通話發生困難，其原因約述如下：（一）敵　自强佔上海電話局後，八年來對各局電話綫路，從未修繕，各處綫路破爛不堪，致時有障　發生。（二）目前因通信材料缺乏，除先將軍政各機關之電話搶修外，其他各商用電話，亦正在逐一修理中，惟各處綫路損壞過多，恐一時難能完全修竣。</p>
<p>日人電話應即過戶</p>
<p>（三）市上有許多用戶承襲日籍人員之電話，照章應辦過戶或裝接等手續，均未照辦，甚且有私自移裝之情形，但此等日籍用戶，本局早已停綫，非經正式手續，不予接通用，用不明價相，因而誤會。（四）本市仍有少數用戶，不知使用本局電話之方法，以致時常打不通，而本局試騐，則爲良好。、按本局所轄各區域內，互相通話時，只須聽得表軌聲，即可直接撥號，如與上海電話公司之用戶通話時，亦可以自動轉接，由用戶控制用戶，在聽得聽筒內表軌聲後，先撥（〇）字，再待聽得上海電話公司之表軌聲後，即可撥所要之號碼，若不待表軌聲連續撥兩種號碼，各用戶必致不通或錯接號碼。（五）上海電話公司各用戶呌接本局所　各區域之電話（即由「〇二」號碼轉接之電話），係由上海電話公司之接綫生所轉接，兩自渺局中間用人工轉接，往往發生困難，本局最近受到許多責難，實非本局之咎。</p>
<p>必須塡表滯則停話</p>
<p>（六）本局現正在整理電話用戶，調查設備及轉移情形，謀用戶福利，凡已收到電話用戶調查表之各用戶，應速將調查表送至北四川路八七二號三樓本局話務科，如現在裝有本局電話，而未接到調查表者，請即日向本局話務科索取塡報，如在三十五年一月十日止尚未塡送調查表各電話用戶，本局認為其不需需要重行通話，其話機將一律予以拆除。（七）用戶電話如有故障，（6）字頭者打電話到（60060），（7）字頭者打電話到（70060），（8）字頭者打電話到（82060），（5）字頭者打電話到（50060），通知各測量台，可即予測試派工修現，若在本局接收後未辦正式手續者，則須向本局話務科接治登記，依次繳費，予以接通。</p>
<h3 id="c90">優待國軍觀劇　電影院協商辦法　擬每院每星期輪流招待一塲 <a href="#c90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市各電影院對於優待國軍觀劇，已擬具相當辦法。據院方代表，大華大戲院總經理李迪雲告記者，影院當局對於八年抗戰國軍勞苦功高，亟需獲得娛樂之情形，甚表同情，已迭次與英國八影片公司協商免費辦法，然各影片商堅決反對首輪影片免費招待。該代表等並表示，如各影院必需將首輪影片免費招待，則影片商可能停止在此供給影片，並收回已發各片。</p>
<p>現影院方面所建議之辦法，即擬將全市大小影院四十餘家，分成四組，每組十家，共計約有座位入百隻，按各地段分配，每星期輪流免費招待國軍一塲，即平均每院每月免費招待一次。淞滬警備總司令部王副官處處長，昨日於各劇院代表協商會議中，亦表示贊同此建議。國軍方面盼於每星期日中午十二時，供彼等觀劇。院方擬則定每星期六中午，由十家同時免費招待，預先發給免費劵。國軍方面則由領隊長官親自率領軍人，按次序前往。</p>
<p>李氏並定今日召集各院代表商討一切，作最後決定。如影片商仍堅持不得免費，則或擬由院方認付相當代價購片，以供國軍免費觀劇。如片商能同意各點，即可長期按以上辦法實行。</p>
<p>又據美駐滬副領事霍華德氏談，美片商之不能同意免費供國軍觀劇，乃亦不得已事。英美軍入赴各劇院亦須購票，國軍待遇較低，已書面向軍政當局建議，開放虹口區，由市府從日軍方面接收之影院，由片商供應二輪影片放映，俟市政當局有所決定後，即可進行。</p>

<h3 id="c91">戲場秩序維持之我見 <a href="#c91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>— 郝水邨</p>
<p>讀了十二月二十七日上海申報自由談裏『誰維持劇塲秩序』一文後，倒引起了筆者一點感想來。</p>
<p>首先要向讀者聲明的是，筆者是一個軍人，我幷不在上海，而是在杭州。爲了使今後劇塲秩序免得再事擴大起見，筆者願以軍人身份，揆其發生衝突的原因，加以檢討，略抒所見：</p>
<p>首先，我們先談一談軍人方面。</p>
<p>君羊君說：『我們軍人的確太缺少娛樂了，營部里簡直沒有戲聽，沒有電影看，於是只好任其到外面各劇塲去尋娛樂。』這話是一點不錯的。</p>
<p>第一，老總們說起來，一般的智識水準都很低，在他們除了打硬仗，出操，攤勤務外，他們唯一的娛樂法不是賭，就是嫖，再不然就是看戲（他們只會看不會聽）看電影了。因爲他們不像美軍那樣每星期一，四，日有着五彩的隨軍電影，臨時的舞會，他們除了政治指導員爲他們設說笑話，講講故事以外，在營里唯一消遣辦法，便是三五成羣的偸偸地賭。或是在駐地附近找一找『情人。』但是我們都知道，他們的待遇是相當苦的，每月的收入也很有限，關餉不到三五日一嘩啦就光了，那還能談到『賭』或者用錢去找『情人』？於是在這種苦悶的環境下，營裏便蹲不住了，白天沒機會出門，一到晚上總想出去找機會發洩一下，這沒別的，只有到鑼鼓喧閙的平劇塲去了。</p>
<p>第二，不否否認的，是老總們都有些「傲」氣，他們總是這樣想：在抗戰當中，拋頭顴，酒熱血，拚死拚活，如今把鬼子幹掉，當然大部是軍人的功勞，老百姓也就要對老總們加又客氣。因此民眾們稍微對他們有些踅扭的地方，他們就覺着不順眼，發起『莊客服火，』而至意氣不投，拔刀相向起來。</p>
<p>第三，上海是一個最引人『心慌』的地方，老總們在抗戰當中所接觸到的，儘是些砲坑，彈痕，荒煙蔓谷，多見石頭少見人的地方，艱苦的滋味，早已嘗了，熬到現在，僥倖未死，一旦來到這耀眼目的大上海，當然更爲心野起來。俗語說：『眼不見嘴不說，耳不聽心不心不煩』。他們開到上海，任務自然是攤勤務，任警戒，白天恐怕也不出操。你想他們一清閒下來，還不是想法兒到外面溜溜。但中荷包裏空空的，到那裏呢？到舞塲，不够格；到餐館，沒有鈔票，空流涏；在街上兜來兜去沒辦法，還是去聽聽　鼓喧天，看看台上的『軸子』，去喝個采。於是劇院裏老總兒們也就多起來了。</p>
<p>第四，他們的待遇太苦，在單人最苦的階段，上海人恐怕還陌生的很，至於怎樣苦，上海人也沒見過，我們不必談。現在單就施行『新給與』以後來說：一個兵的待遇，亦不過一千二百多元，按上海的物價來講，他們每月除了菜金以外，所剩最多亦不過四五百元。讀者們想想看，他們除了買肥皂洗衣服，和偸偸地吃吃香烟以外，還能够買什麼？他們又那裏有錢買戲票？照規矩講，劇院都是營業，一個不買票，兩個不買票，那麼辦劇院的豈不要喝西北風？於是在這種互相矛盾之下，事兒也就多起來了。</p>
<p>再談談劇院方面：</p>
<p>第一，上海地方的人們，對於穿『二尺半』的老總們，一向是瞧不起，有些啤視的。說的嚴重一點，他們簡直是『討厭』。讓者不要以爲筆者說的有點兒『過火』，不信，這裏有事實爲證。</p>
<p>筆者有一個朋友，到上海南京路一家皮鞋店買皮鞋，他穿了一身灰色軍裝，紮了一支小的窄皮帶（這是戰時的規定官長不準紮武裝帶的士兵一律），一眼看去活像是一個小兵（其實他還是一個少校）。一進門，店員們向他投射一下奇異的眼光，及至他說要看貨色，不料那些店員們却似動非動，愛答不理的說：『這樣的要一萬多法幣呀！』我那位朋友聽着有些刺耳：『咦！一萬多怎樣？』他有點不耐煩。於是有一位店員說：『我是說這五六千元的，你們軍人穿着經濟呀。」於是那位朋友因此而竟走開了。他剛走出店門，聽到裏面一位店員說：『他那裏是買皮鞋，還不乘機會白相白相』。他聽了有些氣，但終於忍了下去。</p>
<p>第二，上海多數人是『裁縫眼』（即綢緞眼的意思），尤其看到了那穿着又髒又舊的灰軍裝的人，更共『那個』。再有講話帶『刺』，也是引起衝突的最大原因。譬如上次勝利戲院顧先生的挨揍，也是最顯明的一例。他第一句：『我們大家都是中國人』，這顯然是有些不順耳。第二句：『……犯不上給日本僑民看』。這些帶『刺』的話，更是引起衝突的最大原因。常說『人爲一口氣，佛爲一柱香』。在大庭廣衆之間，偏偏要用這種帶』刺』的話豈不是等於撕破他們的驗皮？讀者想想看：人是要臉，樹是要皮的，何况是這羣帶了『傲氣』的武裝哥兒？</p>
<p>第三，對於軍人缺少了優待——我們說優待，並不是天天睛他看白戲，而是說對他們也應該有些體諒，設法弄出些旁邊的空位子來，也讓他們有機會開開心。你說到天邊兒上去，無論如何你總抹不掉他們八年多的苦勞。這在劇院方面，像是忽酪了這一點，地方當局也沒注意到。</p>
<p>關於軍人與戲院兩方面的情形，我們已舉出了難點，自然還談不到完盡，這里筆者願爲君羊君作一個補充，想一個維持劇院秩序的辦法，這辦法雖然不够高明，不够澈底，但我總望軍人和劇塲兩方面無妨來一　個　試。</p>
<p>中國人作事，向來是憑經驗的，不從經驗里得到敎訓，是絕對不知改善的。現在我們暫時也不要大談理論，單應現實來說：</p>
<p>劇院裏的負責人總挨　，當然不是辦法；然而軍人只發莊稼火動野靈，伸手打人更不成。但若劇院方面，爲了怕挨打要求當局裂軍人以「閉門　」，更不合理，同時更會弄出比打人還嚴重多少倍的事體來。</p>
<p>至於怎樣嚴重，筆者並不是有意「危言聳聽」。上海人還沒有領敎過，在後方辦劇院的人都曉得，甚至都嚐過。我們以爲在政府對於軍人的娛樂，沒有澈底解決以先，筆者還希望上海各劇院的負資人不要看輕了這一點。同時更不要要求地方當局予軍人以「重壓」」。大家要設法從根本解決。</p>
<p>第一，各戲院要盡量設優待軍人席：</p>
<p>內地各戲院，都有這種辦法，所謂優待席並不是讓他們坐在池子裏，而是在兩廊的「邊座」上，或是樓上的「兩廊」，這樣在劇院方面雖然蒙受了不少損失，但在營業和劇院的秩序上當然好維持的多了。</p>
<p>第二，星期日白天要演「日戲」：</p>
<p>一般的軍人在星期日，是都會假出門的，禮拜天，無妨演給他們看，但演的戲不要太敷析馬虎了，戲院老　要極力向演員們解釋慰勞軍人之意。</p>
<p>第三，戲院里的職員態度要客氣：</p>
<p>劇院職員的「裁縫眼」是萬萬要不得的，筆者並不是說要向軍人卑躬屈膝，而是說和軍人見面，大家至少應該相互點頭，態度放和平一點。</p>
<p>第四，部隊方面，要嚴厲管束士兵，萬勿因了這麼一點小事，而爲上海人抹煞了我們八年苦幹的偉大勞績。無論星期，假日，或是每天夜出的人數，一定要有限制，每日要輪流去看，同時更要有官長或班長帶班。</p>
<p>第五，服裝一定要整齊，符號，臂章，皮帶一樣也不能少，到劇院裏，一定要到指定的優待軍人席去坐。絕對不許亂坐，以破壞劇院秩序，而遭受社會人士的指責。</p>
<p>這樣一來，我相信劇院的秩序，一定可以維持得住，慢慢地好起來。</p>
<p>又上拙見，筆者係就事實而寫，幷沒加上理論高調，我們希望試試看，幷以獻於軍事當局和劇院。</p>
<p>動物</p>
<h3 id="c92">螞蟻 <a href="#c92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>— 文荃</p>
<p>觀螞蟻找食，是很够興味的。</p>
<p>尤其是在炎暑逼人的夏天，正是這些小動物工作最形忙碌的時候。當你懶散得連書也感到無心去讀的時候，那末，你不妨從藤椅裏站起來，去「快賞」一回他們的工作，眞會使你神爲之往。</p>
<p>螞蟻的力量，確乎很大。一隻螞蟻獨個就能拉起較它自身大上數倍的東西跑；死蒼蠅之類祇消兩三雙，也已足够應付有餘了。更大的東西，牠們會集攏了很多的同伴，前擁後推地搬進了它們的「洞府」。</p>
<p>我每喜以整隻的鮮蝦或是死蜻蜓來引誘牠們，看牠們浩浩蕩蕩整隊而來，眞是秩序井然，有條不紊，於是緊張的局面展開了，牠們在目的物的四周蠕蝶而動，忽遽地用觸餒相互交談。這裏，牠們只是默默地工作，沒有爭奪，沒有貪懶，牠們祇有一個目標—爲着大衆，爲着整個蟻羣而努力。在不到數分鐘，抬着這份豐富的「獵物」，在他們同心協力之下徐徐地凱旋歸去。</p>
<p>小如螞蟻之類，也能生息審殖，不全在其能營團體的生活嗎？由此可見合作的可貴，羣力的偉大。我們身爲「萬物之靈」的人類，究能及得上牠們的多少呢？營私舞弊，爭權奪利，這是人類的慣技。我們高呼的「精誠團結」，「協力同心」，却眞正地實現在小小動物蟻羣之中。請與螞蟻的工作精神來一比較，你能不慚愧？</p>

<h3 id="c93">我們需要的精神食糧 <a href="#c93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>— 石溪</p>
<p>食物的營養素中有炭水化合物·脂肪~蛋白質·燐·鐵·鈣和各種維他命，這些物質的食糧保持我們身體的健康。在精神方面，我也同樣地需要富於營養的文化食糧，推進精神的健康。</p>
<p>我是收復區裏渴望精神食糧的一員，我所需要的（也許是你所需要的）營等素，有下列的種種。</p>
<p>第一是關於揭處漢奸醜史和鼓勵忠良的文字：</p>
<p>收復區人最切齒痛恨的是至今依然逍遙法外的大小漢奸。他們罪大惡極，助紂爲虐。爲了天地正氣和民族的紀律，各界應當一致加以聲討；把那些喪心病在的大小漢奸過去的醜史和毒害忠良的行爲，赤裸裸地描寫出來，加以無情的抨擊！將那天地間的正氣，民族的節操，表揚出來，鼓勵忠良，制裁貪汚，嚴辦奸僞。使我人精神振奮。</p>
<p>第二是富於建設性的文字：</p>
<p>戰後今日，正建設伊始之時，我們渴望祖國復興，有如大旱之望靈電。那些有關經濟建設，交通復原，農業增產……種種富於戰後建設性的理論文字與實施方案，各項資材，都足以增長我對建設方面的見識。</p>
<p>第三是關於科學的新知識：</p>
<p>處於今日『原子時代』，科學萬能和萬惡，難免將來不受某種『原子』式的生存的威脅，我們如不願做時代的落伍者，那麼，對於研究科學的各種問題，像有關「原子能」的探討，新式武器認識，保健治療醫學的應用等等前進的科學新知識，應多多的注意，使我和一班同樣缺乏科學知識的國人，能時時吸收和消化這些增進一精神健康的營養素。</p>
<p>第四是有關人類生存的，征服大自然的科學方法：</p>
<p>怎樣開墾荒地，開採　源，從事大規模農事生產，獵捕珍禽奇獸，與征服大自然的種種科學方法的貢獻；鼓勵創造的人生，加强我對人間　的新認識，我祈求道類好文章。</p>
<p>此外，那些鏟除人與人爭的自私觀念的規約；消滅戰爭，創造和平幸福的人生。這一類的文字，都是有所亟需的精神糧食。</p>

<p>[Our Chongqing Dispatch, 4th] The Political Consultative Conference is about to be held on the same day. The full list of participants for the pre-conference talks has been largely decided after repeated revisions, as follows:</p>
<p>Kuomintang: Sun Tu, Shao Lizi, Zhang Qun, Zhang Zhizhong, Chen Lifu, Wu Tiecheng, Chen Bulei, Zhang Lisheng.</p>
<p>Communist Party: Zhou Enlai, Ye Jianying, Wang Ruofei, Lu Dingyi, Dong Biwu, Wu Yuzhang, Deng Yingchao.</p>

<p>Non-Party Affiliated: Wang Yunwu, Shao Congen, Fu Sinian, Mo Dehui, Guo Moruo, Miao Yuntai, Li Zhuchen, Qian Xinzhi.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from Chongqing, 4th] The government's proposal regarding the cessation of military conflicts and the restoration of transportation has received a reply telegram from Yan'an. The content is roughly as follows: (1) Agreement to restore transportation, including land, sea, and air transport. (2) Agreement that one representative from the government and the Communist Party, together with Marshall, will negotiate specific measures for ceasing conflict, accepting surrender, and related matters. (3) Agreement to organize a military inspection group, the organization of which will be overseen by the Political Consultative Conference, with representatives from the Political Council and other sectors also participating. It is reported that government and Communist Party representatives are currently engaged in rational discussions on technical aspects.</p>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 4th] Representatives from both the Kuomintang and the Communist Party today discussed the four points of the CCP's response to the government's peace proposal. The CCP's answers are largely consistent with the government's views. The four points are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) U.S. Special Envoy Marshall can participate in the three-person committee to determine the procedures for ceasing conflict and restoring railway transportation. (2) An immediate cessation of conflict throughout the country, especially in Rehe Province. (3) The restoration of transportation should include land, sea, air, and postal and telecommunications, and finally, the lifting of the blockade around the CCP-controlled areas. (4) The investigation team should include important figures from all sectors of the country, including representatives from the Political Consultative Conference. The CCP's answer was presented at the meeting of KMT and CCP representatives yesterday. The government side was represented by Zhang Qun, Wang Bijie, and Shao Lizi, and the CCP side was represented by Zhou Enlai, Ye Jianying, Wang Ruofei, and Dong Biwu.</p>
<p>Hopes for Peace; Not to be Overly Optimistic</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] Although the CCP has replied to the government's proposal, hopes for peace do not seem very bright, and there is still anxiety here. Minister of Information Wu Guozhen stated: Some points listed in the CCP's answer, such as the request to lift the so-called blockade of the liberated areas, need to be clarified. The CCP spokesperson stated: Lifting the blockade means that any central troops hindering traffic in the liberated areas should be withdrawn and the central army defenses around the liberated areas should be destroyed.</p>
<p>[Our Report] San Francisco, 4th, midnight broadcast: From Chongqing, the government and Communist Party sides did not continue negotiations today because Chairman Chiang is reviewing the four suggestions proposed by the Communist Party.</p>
<p>[Our Report] London, 5th, 2:00 AM broadcast: Chairman Chiang is reviewing the Communist Party's response to the government's proposal. The government side still expresses that it is not overly optimistic, believing that there is no possibility of an immediate truce at present. Chinese Minister of Information Wu Guozhen expressed hope for a swift truce. It is believed here that since Chairman Chiang and Mao Zedong issued a joint declaration on October 10, negotiations between the central government and the communists have made no progress or development.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 4th] U.S. Special Envoy to China, Marshal Marshall, received Turkish Ambassador Duke today. At 11:30 AM, he also received Australian Chargé d'affaires Xiao Dai. Marshal Marshall spent the afternoon reading news reports and related materials.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] Chinese Youth Party members Hui Qi, Zuo Shunsheng, Chen Qitian, Yu Jiaju, Chang Yansheng, Yang Shuming, etc. celebrated on the 4th with Zhang Dongsun, Liang Shuming, Luo Longji, Zhang Bojun, Shen Junru, Zhang Shenfu, and others, exchanging opinions on the agenda of the Political Consultative Conference.</p>

<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 4th] According to official sources, one Chinese liaison officer is scheduled to go to Shenyang today to discuss the takeover of Shenyang with the Soviet authorities.</p>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 4th] Central News Agency reported today: General Du Yuming's rapid advance troops have already arrived at Xinmin, 35 miles west of Shenyang, four miles west of the city, and have agreed with the Soviet side on the peaceful takeover of Xinmin. At the same time, the Communist armies in Shandong and Shanxi provinces continue to disrupt railway transportation, with the Jinan-Qingdao Railway and the Datong-Puzhou Railway damaged again. In the second half of December, there were multiple landmine explosions in the two provinces.</p>
<p>(Another Dispatch) Today, civil war is still ongoing in the two major areas of North China and many minor areas. There are large-scale battles in eastern Rehe Province, with government troops penetrating deep into Rehe Province from their Jinzhou base, advancing towards the provincial capital, Chengde. Communist Party sources claim that the National Army has occupied Chaoyang, an important railway city 140 miles east of Chengde. Government spokespersons deny this, stating that as of today, Chongqing has not received this news. The second most important war zone is the Lincheng area in southern Shandong. According to Minister of Information Wu Guozhen, as of today, the Communist army is still advancing. In addition, government sources also stated that the Communist army is currently attacking many other cities in Shandong Province, including Qufu, the hometown of Confucius, north of Lincheng. The Communist army is also attacking Gaoyou in northern Jiangsu. The government's explanation for its actions in Rehe is that there were no Communist troops in Rehe before the Japanese surrender, and the Allied countries agreed that the National Army would take over the area. Government sources stated: "In terms of legal and factual circumstances, the government's actions in Rehe are fully justified and are not a civil war."</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 4th] It is reported that the Communist army is still frequently engaging in the destruction of highway transportation in various places. Between Guihua and Wuchuan, as many as fourteen bridges on the highway have been destroyed by the Communist army.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 4th] It is reported that a village five kilometers northwest of Taixian was set on fire by the Communist army a few days ago. When the villagers tried to put out the fire, they were attacked, and the entire village was burned down.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 3rd] The commander of the First Battalion of the Xinjiang People's Liberation Team under the Taiyue Military Region of the Communist Army is Gao Haizha, and the commander of the Second Battalion is Li Guotai. Each unit, with more than a hundred people, is causing disturbances in Quwo and Xinjiang, plotting to expand the so-called liberated areas. In addition, thirty-six organizations in Shanxi Province issued a telegram denouncing the atrocities of the Communist army, stating that 50,000 people in Shanxi have died due to the Communist army's instigation of chaos, and the loss of houses and materials amounts to tens of billions.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 3rd] The Hebei Provincial Reconstruction Promotion Association's Beiping branch, in view of the Communist Party's division and occupation, destruction of unity, obstruction of the surrender process, and harm to the people's lives, recently sent a telegram to the National Political Council, appealing for the nationalization of the army and the democratization of politics. In addition, the fellow villagers associations of various counties in Hebei Province recently sent a telegram to the Central Government and the National Political Council, vowing to uphold national unity with the public opinion of 30 million people, earnestly hoping that the Communist Party will lay down its butcher knife, be compassionate, hand over military power to the government, and return political power to the people.</p>
<p>[City Report] People from Jiangsu Gaoyou, residing in Chongqing, Chengdu, Nanjing, Shanghai, Zhenjiang, Hangzhou, Beiping, Tianjin, Wuhan, and Guangdong, sent a joint telegram, reporting the situation of the siege of Gaoyou and requesting the government to quell the unrest and pacify the people.</p>

<h3 id="e4">Friend of China During the War of Resistance; Flying Tigers Leader Returns to China Again; Chongqing Preparing a Hero's Welcome Ceremony <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 4th] Chongqing is preparing a hero's welcome ceremony today to welcome former Commander of the U.S. Fourteenth Air Force in China, Major General Chennault. General Chennault flew from San Francisco on Wednesday and will take a position in China in civilian aviation or the air force. The famous "Flying Tigers" he previously led in China controlled a vast area between Taiwan and Northeast China, penetrating deep into Japanese airspace. Government officials and military circles have not disclosed Chennault's position in China. According to reports from New York by our agency, members of the Fourteenth Air Force believe that the leader of the "Flying Tigers" will undoubtedly train young air force personnel in China as a civilian. It is believed here that Chennault requested that news of his trip not be publicized before his departure from San Francisco, so the issue of Chennault's position will definitely be announced by himself, as the Chinese authorities respect his request. His "Flying Tigers" shot down many Japanese planes in Chinese airspace and regained vast safe areas for the Chinese army in the early stages of the war. His task was obviously not easy. At that time, the number of aircraft was insufficient, supplies were scarce, and air transport from India to China was lacking. Great planning was needed to transport bulky supplies from the United States to usable areas in China, taking 75 to 90 days. The supply line was arguably the longest in the world, totaling 16,000 miles. In April 1943, after a long period of preparation, the U.S. Air Force began operations in southeastern China. In March of that year, the Fourteenth Air Force, commanded by General Chennault, established the U.S. Air Force in China as an individual unit. Shortly before its first attack, the Japanese Air Force resumed its offensive, and the Japanese Marines landed in Guangzhou Bay in the French Concession on the Leizhou Peninsula, building an airfield to confront the Allied forces. One month after the first U.S. Air Force attack, the Fourteenth Air Force severely attacked Hainan Island, occupied by the Japanese army, and the Hanoi-Haiphong area in northern Vietnam. In May of that year, the Japanese army launched a general offensive with five divisions against Yichang, Changde, and Chongqing, but ultimately failed. Chinese and American air force personnel shot down 31 Japanese planes over Yichang. The offensive of the Chinese and American air forces was reaching its climax at this time. On Thanksgiving Day in 1943, the Chinese-American mixed air force bombed a certain airfield in Taiwan, destroying many Japanese planes, and the entire team returned to base safely. One year later, Chinese skies were filled with "Flying Tigers" on liberated bombers, and its achievements are now evident to all.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, City Report] U.S. military headquarters reported yesterday that U.S. troops in China currently account for 13.4% of all U.S. troops, a substantial decrease, as they accounted for 32.1% of the total last October. [United Press, Tianjin, 3rd] The Marine Corps headquarters here announced today that the transfer of senior officers and soldiers of the U.S. Marine Corps has been accelerated comprehensively. According to official announcements, 5,000 officers and soldiers will return to the United States aboard the luxury cruise ship "General R. L. Howze", which is about to arrive in China. The cruise ship will carry the same number of redeploying personnel. At the same time, the repatriation of Japanese soldiers and civilians, which had been suspended for a short period, has also resumed. During this short period of hiatus, the U.S. side sent tank landing craft to Shanghai to assist in the repatriation. Today, due to strong winds blowing through Tanggu Port, the train departing from Tianjin was forced to return, so the repatriation work was temporarily suspended. Three thousand six hundred soldiers and one hundred officers of the First Marine Division and the Third Amphibious Force will return to the country aboard the "General R. L. Howze" cruise ship. It is expected that they will board the ship at Tanggu around January 10. The ship will stop briefly in Qingdao to pick up a portion of the officers of the Sixth Division and then return directly to Sandy Hook, California, with an estimated arrival date of January 31.</p>
<h3 id="e5">Intricacies of the Northeast; "Chinese Communist Army" and "Joint Communist Army" <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 3rd] Mr. Zhou Jingwen told reporters today that the situation in the Northeast is complex. The Communist army in southern Northeast China is under the command of Yan'an, while the Communist army north of Changchun is under the command of the Russian side. The former is called the "Chinese Communist Army," and the latter is called the "Joint Communist Army." The "Joint Communist Army" underwent years of training before the Russian army entered the Northeast and entered the Northeast simultaneously with the Red Army in August. This army is composed of the former Anti-Japanese Chinese Volunteer Army, which was expelled by the Japanese, and pro-Russian Koreans and Mongolians, who have been standing by in Siberia for several years. Before and after the occupation of the Northeast by the military, they served as the best fifth column, totaling about 100,000 people. The number of the "Chinese Communist Army" is about the same. Mr. Zhou concluded by saying that the Russian army has set up a joint minefield line along the Changchun Railway.</p>
<h3 id="e6">Military Service System Ten-Year Plan <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>Abolition of Military District Divisions</p>
<p>[Our Chongqing Dispatch, 4th] Regarding the military service system, the central government hopes to lay a sound foundation in the near future. It is reported that the Military Service Department has drafted a ten-year plan and submitted it to the authorities for review. When the new plan is implemented in the future, the existing military districts and divisional districts will be abolished, and they will be replaced by a military region system under the unified planning of the Military Service Department. Detailed measures will be announced after approval.</p>
<h3 id="e7">Completing Two Major Tasks in Beiping; President Song Arrives in Tianjin for Inspection; Promoting Economic Reconstruction and Developing Trade <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 3rd] President Song has already completed most of his work in Beiping and will go to Tianjin tomorrow. The Dagukou New Port and several large yarn factories there will be his main targets of inspection. During his week in Beiping, President Song accomplished two major tasks: the postal and telecommunications price increase was temporarily suspended. If the price was implemented uniformly across the country, the people of North China would have to pay 20 yuan to send a letter instead of two yuan, and news reporters sending urgent telegrams to Shanghai would go from 8 jiao per word to 2 yuan. Once implemented, the impact on prices would be unimaginable. He established an office of the Executive Yuan with the highest authority to resolve unreasonable phenomena during the takeover process. Only one seal is allowed to be affixed to a large door, and this seal should be quickly removed to allow the machinery inside to start running. The principle of resuming work has been largely determined. Factories of the same nature will be merged together. For example, there cannot be two institutions for textiles in Tianjin or for iron production in Beiping. Some small factories will be opened to welcome private capital participation. The funds required for the resumption of work in various factories can be approved by the government for loans from banks. Most factories can be fully restored within three months. Conditions in more complicated factories will be delayed for more than four months. The Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant is the most valuable industrial asset left by the enemy in North China, but it relies on raw materials from the Longyan Iron Mine, which is controlled by the Communist army, making it impossible to resume work at present.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 3rd] President Song stated in Beiping that the government will take effective measures to stabilize prices and that this year's budget will be balanced to avoid increasing the issuance of currency as much as possible. Regarding enemy-puppet-operated enterprises, the government will continue to make every effort to complete those that are truly of continued value, such as the Dagukou New Port. This statement was made by Mr. Song at a banquet for councilors yesterday afternoon. Cheng Shewo strongly argued during the meeting that the country should attach importance to North China, and said that if it could be attached importance to even if the capital was not located in Beiping after the Northern Expedition, the history before and after the September 18th Incident would have been different. Xiao Yishan also said that the Ming Dynasty would not have lasted for two hundred years if it had not moved the capital to Beiping. Song expressed the same feeling about the importance of Beiping.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 4th] President Song flew from Beiping to Tianjin at 11:00 AM on the 4th, accompanied by Sun Yueqi, director of the Beiping-Tianjin District Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau, and Liu Zongyi, director of the Hebei Salt Affairs Administration.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 4th] President Song is scheduled to stay in Tianjin for three days and will receive central and local officials at his official residence. He will hold a meeting in the afternoon to give instructions on the takeover of enemy-puppet property and handling measures. Zhang Yan'e, Du Jianshi, Tan Boyu, Sun Yueqi, He Weiye, and others participated. A dinner was held in the evening for U.S. military commander Locky and Chief of Staff Walton. [Central News Agency, Tianjin, 4th] President Song issued a written statement to reporters in Tianjin as follows:</p>
<p>"Tianjin is the economic center of northern China, and its foreign trade also occupies an important position. When the Dagukou New Port is completed in the future, its importance will be further increased. This visit is to inspect and promote economic reconstruction and the handling of the takeover of enemy and puppet property and other matters. I will stay for three or two days, because it has been difficult for a long time, and there are many matters to be dealt with, so I must return quickly."</p>
<h3 id="e8">Zhou Yichun to Fly to Beiping <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 4th] Minister of Agriculture and Forestry Zhou Yichun will fly from Chongqing to Beiping soon to personally handle the takeover of agricultural agencies. Mr. Zhou's arrival is at the behest of President Song. After arriving in Beiping, Mr. Song learned that the enemy's agricultural agencies in North China were large, complete, and successful, and could not be taken over and handled by the special commissioner's office, which was lacking in manpower and financial resources. Therefore, he telegraphed Mr. Zhou to come. It is reported that the North China Agricultural Experiment Station, the main agricultural institution in North China, is the largest in East Asia, with its branch stations spread throughout North China. It has made great contributions to the enemy's production increase work over the years. The main station in the western suburbs of Beiping originally had 500 employees. After the takeover, only 30 Japanese experts were retained due to lack of funds.</p>

<h3 id="e12">Two Banks and Bureaus Send Personnel to Qingdao to Handle the Takeover of Enemy and Puppet Financial Institutions <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Qingdao, 4th] The Four Banks and Two Bureaus have all sent personnel to Qingdao to prepare for the establishment of branch banks and bureaus. The Central Bank, the Bank of China, the China Trust Bureau, and the Postal Remittances Bureau officially opened for business today. All enemy and puppet financial institutions in Qingdao are monitored by personnel dispatched by the Central Bank. The vault has been sealed off, but the Zhengjin is handled by the Bank of China. All enemy and puppet banks and associations will be closed from today. Regarding the clearing of counterfeit (United Reserve Bank) notes circulating in the market, the Central Bank will begin collection and exchange on the 7th and plans to restore remittances with various places. Since Qingdao's takeover, the exchange between counterfeit money and legal tender has been extremely chaotic. At the beginning of October, one yuan of legal tender was exchanged for seven or eight yuan of counterfeit money. Since the municipal government issued a notice on the legal price of one to five, the black market soared to three yuan and five jiao. In November, the legal tender rose, and by December, it had risen to one yuan of legal tender for seven yuan of counterfeit money. Due to financial stringency, industry and commerce were extremely sluggish. Now that the various banks and bureaus have resumed business, they should be able to recover.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 4th] Chen Yaodong talked about the clearing and restoration of banks and money shops in Nanjing: (1) There are more than 160 commercial banks and money shops that have closed down in this city. Most of them have now completed the clearing within the three-month deadline in accordance with regulations. Only a few banks and shops still need to correct the procedures and report the method of handling the remaining assets and the share value of the shareholders who aided the enemy. (2) The restoration of the banks is very smooth. The banks that have resumed business in addition to the Four Banks and Two Bureaus are Jiangsu Second Bank, Jiangsu Farmers Bank, New China Trust and Savings Bank, Shanghai Commercial and Savings Bank, and Nanjing Commercial and Savings Bank. There are seven banks that are preparing to resume business: China General Chamber of Commerce, China South, Guohua, Zhongfu, Juxingcheng, China Industrial, and Siming. (3) Regarding the resumption of business of the money shops established before the war, the Nanjing Municipal Chamber of Commerce Political Election Preparatory Committee requested that the restoration methods of commercial banks be applied and that they be restored to business as early as possible. The matter is being requested for instructions. (4) There were eight former enemy and puppet banks in Nanjing: Central Reserve Bank, Xingye, Taiwan, Korea, Shanghai, Japan, Hankou, and the puppet Bank of China. All of them have been taken over separately. (5) The situation of exchanging counterfeit money in this city is quite good. From October 1 to December, the various banks and bureaus in the city have collected and exchanged counterfeit money totaling more than 120 billion yuan, equivalent to more than 600 million yuan in legal tender.</p>

<h3 id="e21">MacArthur Issues Another Order for Japan; Orders Elimination of Warmongers; So That New Leaders Can Emerge in Politics Who Value the Present and Do Not Yearn for the Past; Cabinet Calls Emergency Meeting This Morning <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 4th] Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers MacArthur today issued two orders, ordering the Japanese government to eliminate all ultra-nationalist terrorist parties, militarist groups, or any societies that have deceived and lured the Japanese people into a plan to conquer the world. This order from MacArthur is a further step than previous orders, aiming to implement the requirements of the Potsdam Declaration, that Japan should break away from the shackles of irresponsible warlords, as a price for peace. This order aims to liberate the newly established political parties and the government itself from the warlords and feudal forces, and to ensure that government officials are no longer threatened by secret organizations and terrorist worker attacks. MacArthur ordered the cancellation of 27 parties and associations, most of which held political power. These include the Greater Japan Innovation Association, the Greater East Asia Association, the Black Dragon Society, the Black Ocean Society, the East Asia League, and various other youth organizations. MacArthur's directive also prohibits the organization of any political party or society that seeks to resist or oppose the occupying forces, or support the Japanese warlords' external aggression, exclude foreigners from operating industries and businesses in Japan, promote military or paramilitary training, or advocate other ultra-nationalist plans. The assets of the disbanded organizations will be confiscated and managed by the Japanese government, and all archives and records will be confiscated and published. All members since July 7, 1937, should be transferred to the Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers. The Shidehara cabinet will hold an emergency meeting at 10:00 AM tomorrow to discuss MacArthur's stringent order to purge pro-war elements in the Japanese government. It is not yet clear whether MacArthur's new policy will cause the downfall of the Japanese cabinet; however, it is expected that five cabinet members will be dismissed in accordance with the order. Tokyo newspapers interpret MacArthur's order as giving Japan the opportunity to produce new leaders.</p>
<p>Nurturing the Democratic Tendencies of the Japanese People; Reviving and Strengthening Them</p>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 4th] MacArthur declared in today's order: "If Japan wishes to establish a responsible government securely, then the appointment of new officials must be done with the utmost caution. These officials should nurture the democratic tendencies of the Japanese people, revive and strengthen them, and respect fundamental human rights and freedom of speech, religion, and thought." The number of people affected by this directive is not yet clear, but it is estimated to be in the hundreds. From special agents to cabinet members, officials of the Ministry of Home Affairs, and members of the House of Peers, all those stipulated in the directive are included. Not only will those in charge be dismissed, but parliamentary candidates covered by the directive will lose their eligibility for candidacy, and prefectural governors or mayors will also be dismissed. According to the new directive, a large number of war criminals will be generated, including personnel from the General Staff Headquarters, the Supreme Command Headquarters, and other military agencies, as well as officials from financial and colonial companies. A total of 20 colonial companies, including the South Manchuria Railway Company, the South Manchuria Development Company, the North China Development Company, the Central China Development Company, and the Joseon Trust Company, are included, and their officials are included in the list of war criminals, so as to align actions with the military governments of Korea, Taiwan, Kanto, Nanyang, Dutch East Indies, Malaya, French Indochina, Burma, China, and Manchuria.</p>
<p>Head of the General Headquarters Discusses MacArthur's Order; Decided Before the Moscow Conference</p>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 4th] Deputy Chief of Staff of the Allied General Headquarters, Major General Whitney, stated that MacArthur's order to purge Japanese militarists was not the result of a new control plan for Japan. This directive was being drafted eight weeks before the Moscow Conference decided to establish the Control Commission and the Far Eastern Commission. The individuals involved in today's announcement are one of the fundamental problems we encountered at the beginning of the occupation. According to the Hochi Shimbun, MacArthur issued this order because the Japanese cabinet did not act on its own initiative, which was inevitable. In principle, the Japanese cabinet should have acted on its own initiative, and the Emperor should have paid attention to the issue of new national leaders, and taken remedial measures before the government was prompted by the Allied Commander-in-Chief. Shidehara was absent from today's cabinet meeting due to a cold. It is reported that the directive arrived late and had not been translated for discussion, so the meeting only discussed the new budget.</p>

<p>[US News Service, Washington, 3rd] The State Department announced today that the West Indies Conference initiated by the Anglo-American Caribbean Commission will be held on February 21st in St. Thomas, Virgin Islands. The first West Indies Conference was held in Barbados, British West Indies, in March 1944. According to the provisions of the previous conference, the second conference should be held on US territory under US leadership. The recent announcement by France and the Netherlands to join the Anglo-American Caribbean Commission has made all parties more interested in the future conference. Representatives from the above four countries and their territories will attend the meeting to participate in consultations.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 3rd] The United States has proposed to conclude treaties with Latin American countries stipulating unified action in military affairs to eliminate or prevent aggression anywhere in the Western Hemisphere. All Latin American governments except Argentina are giving it careful consideration today. Latin American diplomatic representatives will present it for discussion at a meeting in the Brazilian capital this spring. Diplomatic circles believe that the US proposal is similar to Uruguay's recent proposal to take collective action in the Western Hemisphere to resist any country that disregards international obligations or denies the inherent human rights of its people. However, the US proposal is only to deal with purely military aggression, while the Uruguayan proposal is to deal with political situations and situations that cause occupational disputes.</p>

<h3 id="e28">From 1946 Onward, Americans Will No Longer Feel a Lack of Material Goods <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>[United Press, New York, 4th] From 1946 onward, Americans will no longer feel a lack of material goods. Fathers' white shirts may already be old, mothers may still be waiting to buy a few pairs of silk stockings, and children may still be wearing last year's pajamas, but this situation will not last long. The lack of daily necessities is a thing of the past.</p>
<p>American industrialists predict that the supply of various daily necessities will gradually increase in 1946.</p>
<p>A year ago, smokers had to run around every day to buy a pack of cigarettes, but now you can easily buy a box of your favorite cigarettes everywhere.</p>
<p>Last spring, the supply of meat was extremely scarce, and many families often did not taste meat for several days, but since the end of the war, the demand for meat from the military has gradually decreased, and the supply of meat has begun to increase. Canned food can be seen again in grocery stores. The Department of Commerce estimates that better quality canned food may be sold in the market in the coming months.</p>
<p>Radio and electrical equipment can also be purchased in the market, which is the first time since the war. The National Shoe Manufacturers Association predicts that shoe factories will soon have an adequate number of leather shoes to supply to the American people. Children's shoes seem to be temporarily in short supply due to high demand, but adult shoes, both men and women, will definitely not be in short supply by the summer of 1946.</p>
<p>In early 1945, every American held a rationing card in hand to prepare to receive the items he needed. This year, he can freely buy anything except sugar. Sugar was the first item that the government rationed during the war, and this rationing may continue for quite some time. The president of the Langba Sugar Exchange once predicted that the supply of sugar may still be very scarce in the spring of 1946 and will only improve after April 1st.</p>
<p>Textiles have been in short supply throughout the past year, and this panic may not be alleviated until this summer. A manufacturer said. Sheets and pillowcases that cannot be bought on the market now will reappear in stores in two or three months. Children's underwear and cotton coats will be available in three months.</p>
<p>The time required to restore the supply of adult clothing to pre-war levels will be longer than for other items. Millions of discharged American soldiers need to replenish their new clothes.</p>
<p>According to the American Underwear Manufacturers Association, the supply of underwear and pajamas will improve in six months. Although the production of casual wear and coats is constantly increasing, it is still not enough to meet the demand, so manufacturers hope to wholesale most of their goods to stores this year to meet the urgent needs.</p>

<p>Nazi Accomplice Confesses Atrocities</p>
<p>[Reuters, Nuremberg, 4th] Former leader of Himmler's Security Police, Ohlendorf, yesterday detailed the atrocities of the secret police in the Nuremberg court, with defendants such as Goering watching. He admitted to designing group murders and witnessing their execution. Under his guidance, 90,000 Jewish men, women, and children were killed in the Soviet Union. Some were shot in tank trenches and ditches, and some were sent to gas vans. The idea of ​​gas vans was to reduce the mental suffering of women and children when they died. At the same time, since there were many unmarried people in the German army, they could be spared the unpleasant task of executing women and children by shooting. People sent to gas vans did not feel pain, which was what the doctor told him, but many of his subordinates were unwilling to undertake the work of cleaning the gas vans, as they believed that such work would cause unnecessary mental disturbances.</p>

<h3 id="e30">British Government Plans to Create a European United Nations Organization, Preparing to Advance Rapidly Along Political and Economic Lines, Aiming to Form a European Supranational State <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>[United Press London, 4th] A certain British responsible official, who wishes to remain anonymous, recently declared: the British government has a plan to gradually strengthen the United Nations organization, with a world government as its ideal. This cannot be achieved in the short term, but the British government believes that the United Nations organization should eventually have the sole and direct power to manage a world police force, and all countries should disarm to the point where none dare challenge the world police. British cabinet members have had various ideals, tending towards the merging of the sovereignty of existing countries, which are already being planned today. Diplomats call it the "technical scope," that is, the economic and social methods by which governments serve their people, which constitute the majority of their services. According to the outline of this plan, it will first be proposed to establish a European regional United Nations organization, advancing along both economic and political lines, to move towards the goal of forming a supranational state. Britain emphasizes the early establishment of a European United Nations organization because European countries have suffered from war, with deep and painful wounds, and may be ready to advance rapidly along the path of "international government," and feel that European countries must unite and cooperate to seek revival. In addition, concrete plans for genuine international management of transportation, aviation, and health have been discussed, and the initiators insist that this organization should establish regional offices in each continent to coordinate the actions of various governments and maintain close liaison between member states and the United Nations. British Foreign Secretary Bevin and Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Noel-Baker recently publicly declared a so-called "world parliament," which is what they mean. Britain feels that the United Nations Charter has laid the foundation for a legal and just system that is universal throughout the world, just as American federal law is more important than the laws of various contradictory states.</p>

<p>For the Development of the Shipping Industry</p>
<p>[United Press New York, 4th] The United States is currently planning to build 395 high-speed merchant ships, including many new types of passenger-cargo ships. If this plan is realized, 50% of American goods can be transported by American ships in the future, and these ships will operate on 33 routes. At the same time, the United States also hopes that the routes previously operated by German and Japanese ships can also be replaced by American ships.</p>
<p>Future competition in the Pacific is inevitable. American shipping companies believe that in order to compete with other countries, they should strive for comprehensive service. They believe that the era of large passenger ships is over, and that such ships, unless otherwise used, may not be able to attract customers.</p>

<h3 id="e33">Hoping Germany Will Establish an Economic Foundation in Two Years: America Issues a Declaration of Policy Towards Germany <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>[United Press Washington, 3rd] The State Department, at the request of the War Department, has issued a declaration of American policy towards Germany, so that the American occupation authorities have something to follow. Since the Potsdam Three Giants Conference in August last year, this is the first time any strong nation has given a detailed explanation of its general policy towards Germany. This declaration was also sent to the governments of the Soviet Union, Britain, and France, who are participating in the occupation. American officials are unwilling to predict the reaction of the three countries, only saying that the policy proposed by the United States assumes that Germany can retain its current borders, including the Ruhr industrial area and the Rhineland. This aspect may be opposed by France, because France insists that the above two areas must be cut off from Germany. This policy compromises the "soft" and "hard" factions, and its ultimate goal is to hope that a defeated Germany can re-establish an economic foundation in two years, sufficient to balance income and expenditure, and improve the living standards of its people. However, to achieve this goal, the United States and its United Nations must provide funds or tens of thousands of dollars so that Germany can import necessary goods in the next two years.</p>
<p>Restoring Germany to Normalcy Requires Three Periods</p>
<p>Secretary of State Byrnes further added that Germany must go through three periods before returning to "normal status": The first period, until the spring of this year, the United Nations should achieve the following four things: (1) Prevent a major famine in Germany, and increase American imports when necessary; (2) Increase Germany's coal exports to the countries "swept away" by Germany to the "maximum extent"; (3) Complete the four-power reparations agreement around February 2, and begin establishing implementing agencies; (4) Establish German administrative agencies in finance, transportation, communications, foreign trade, and industry respectively. The second period, from the spring of this year to February 2, 1948, it can be expected that Germany will gradually recover. Except for factories that are dismantled and removed as reparations, all others can be permanently retained by Germany, and German industry can be revived. In the third period, Germany will manage its economy on its own, subject only to some "residual restrictions" from the United Nations. German industry will flourish and can maintain the same standard of living as other countries in Europe. According to an official, according to the implementation of this policy, Germany will neither be a "fishing, forestry, animal husbandry" country, nor can it become a first-class industrial power, capable of launching two wars of aggression in 25 years.</p>
<p>Soviet-Occupied Zone Gradually Becoming Sovietized</p>
<p>[United Press Berlin, 3rd] Five American journalists, inspecting the Soviet-occupied zone of Germany, saw that it was undergoing a Sovietization plan, with experienced communists holding key positions. Agriculture, industry, and mining are all under the management of the German provincial government, with aid and support from the Soviet military administration. The reporters traveled for eight days, passing through the southeastern part of the Soviet-occupied zone, 125 miles south of Berlin, through Saxony to Dresden. This is the first time Western journalists have been allowed to enter the Soviet-occupied zone. According to an exchange plan, Soviet journalists can also go to the American-occupied zone to inspect. The five American reporters were led by four Soviet personnel, and the cars were driven by the American military. The locations they passed through were chosen by the reporters, and they met with German and Soviet administrators in various places.</p>

<p>[Reuters Batavia, 4th] According to sources with very good information to reporters yesterday, the Indonesian cabinet members put forward several points during the secret talks with Dutch Deputy Governor-General Van Mook, one of which was that the minimum political conditions for Indonesia's acceptance of reconciliation with the Netherlands must include recognition of the current administrative organs as the government. Once this key point is agreed upon, the future relations between the Dutch and Indonesian can be discussed. Well-informed sources expect that there are three possible paths that can be discussed with Van Mook. One is the most acceptable to the Indonesians, that is, the Dutch recognize the current regime, and then negotiate the special status of the Netherlands in its relationship with Indonesia; the second is joint management between the Netherlands and Indonesia; the third is Indonesia implementing autonomy within the Dutch Republic. Given that Van Mook already knows Indonesia's position, rumors that Van Mook said that the Sjahrir cabinet is unable to govern are making government officials uneasy. However, Indonesians declare that they are prepared to closely study the proposals that Van Mook brought back from the Netherlands.</p>

<p>[United Press Hollywood, 4th] American film producer Corwin announced today that now that the war is over, he will step up plans to film a biographical film of Mr. Sun Yat-sen. Corwin had this in mind before the war, but he did not immediately start working because the war might give the story a new twist. The two themes in the film are extraterritoriality and democracy. He hopes that by the time the film is completed, the various problems in China will be resolved, so the film can represent the complete realization of Mr. Sun Yat-sen's ideals in some way. Corwin plans to spend $2 million on the production of the film. Part of the capital has been used in the past 18 months to collect information on Mr. Sun Yat-sen's life. Experts such as Owen Lattimore, Dr. Hu Shih, and Senator Thomas are assisting Corwin in this work. Corwin said that Pearl S. Buck is very interested and willing to help write the script. Big star Paul Muni is very willing to play the role of Mr. Sun Yat-sen, but Corwin will travel to China at the beginning of this year and seek suitable figures in the Chinese film and theater circles before determining the cast.</p>

<p>[United Press Philadelphia, 3rd] Professor Urey of the University of Chicago, one of the inventors of the atomic bomb, and winner of the 1934 Nobel Prize, declared today: "If the world has another war, then germ warfare, its horror and destructiveness, may not be less than that of the atomic bomb. If the unlimited use of the atomic bomb continues to exist, then the threat of germ warfare is also inevitable. Germs such as typhoid and anthrax can be spread. In the past five years, human morality has fallen to an unbelievable level. If there is another war, it is difficult to guarantee that it will not fall further. I hope there is a country international law that stipulates that all countries in the world are not allowed to manufacture atomic bombs, only allowed to retain a certain limited amount of fissionable material, and prohibit germ warfare. We should immediately take steps to stop the competition in atomic bomb weapons. If we cannot eliminate the threat of war, it will be difficult to apply atomic energy to peaceful and industrial uses. However, it will take many days for atomic energy to compete with coal, but in the end there will be another industrial revolution, which is even greater than the first."</p>

<h3 id="e39">From Darkness to Light: Our Air Force's Eight Years of Bloody Battles – Special Contribution from Tiefeng News Agency <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>Our Air Force can be described as a rising force in the modern history of our nation. Its official birth coincided with the period around the "September 18th" Incident. However, in the arduous national war against Japan, it resolutely shouldered the heavy responsibility of defending the motherland's airspace as a young force. The Chinese Air Force began fighting on August 14th, 1937, and continued until the day Japan accepted unconditional surrender, exactly eight years. Over these eight years, it grew from weakness to strength, from a passive position to actively fighting back, from counterattacks to offensives, personally experiencing the victorious end of this war of resistance against Japan. This process of growth and development seems worth a comprehensive report to the people of the country.</p>
<p>First Battle Achievements Lay the Foundation for the Air Force</p>
<p>Let's look at the achievements of the first day: August 14th, 1937, was the first day the young Chinese Air Force participated in the war against Japan. On this first day, the fighter squadrons shot down six enemy planes over Hangzhou in one fell swoop, creating a glorious record of six to zero. The bomber units braved the harsh weather and flew ten sorties in one day, sinking and damaging more than ten enemy ships in the Wusongkou area of the Huangpu River, destroying countless enemy barracks, warehouses, and military supplies in the Shanghai area. This laid the most solid and firm foundation for the increasingly powerful Chinese Air Force.</p>
<p>The most famous Fourth Pursuit Group, which we call the Zhihang Group, shot down sixty enemy planes within seven days of the start of the war, breaking the combat record of the most famous air units of Britain, America, and Germany during World War I.</p>
<p>Initial Comparison: Only One to Fifty-Three</p>
<p>At the beginning of the war of resistance, from late summer to mid-autumn of 1937, the Air Force's main tasks were to defend the capital, guard the Beijing-Shanghai line, attack enemy ships and positions in the Shanghai war zone, assist ground forces, and strictly defend the front lines. However, China's land was so vast, the war zone so expansive, from Shanxi and Chahar in the north to Guangdong in the south, which place did not need the Air Force? The bomber units' surprise attack on the enemy fleet in the South China Sea in September, the long march to Tanggu in November, and the fighter units' shooting down of the enemy's top fighter pilot, Sanwa Kuan, in Taiyuan in October were a few examples of the Air Force's mobile operations during this period.</p>
<p>At this time, the Chinese Air Force was at a disadvantage in terms of numbers. The lack of aircraft, in particular, was undeniable. According to an analysis by the London Times, the ratio between the Chinese Air Force and the enemy was one to fifty-three during this period.</p>
<p>After struggling for several months in this difficult situation, in December 1937, with the retreat from the capital, Nanjing, the Chinese Air Force's achievements temporarily subsided. However, this silence was not a bad thing; it was about replenishment and training. The Chinese Air Force now needed to further strengthen its own power and further enrich its equipment and tactics, preparing to give the air robbers invading our sacred airspace an even more severe blow in the future.</p>
<p>Unprecedented Victory: Regaining Air Supremacy</p>
<p>The famous "February 18th" battle saw twelve enemy planes shot down over Wuhan in twelve minutes, creating an epoch-making, unprecedented victory. At this time, formations of silver planes soared overhead. Some of these planes were monoplanes, some were biplanes, all of which were state-of-the-art fighter planes lent to us by the friendly Soviet Union. The large number and excellent performance allowed us to truly regain air supremacy in the spring and summer of 1938. At the same time, the bomber units also received a large amount of assistance from the friendly Soviet Union, equipping themselves with the latest twin-engine bombers. The bombing of Taipei on February 23rd gave the enemy an unexpected blow. The humanitarian expedition on May 20th saw formations of Chinese planes descend upon the Japanese mainland, scattering millions of leaflets, which had a great effect in terms of strategy and politics. It is especially worth mentioning the continuous air raids on the Yangtze River launched in the summer of 1938 to defend Wuhan.</p>
<p>Numerous Difficulties: Relying on the Northwest Route</p>
<p>After the retreat from Wuhan and the transfer of the military and political center to Chongqing, the Air Force encountered more difficulties. To strengthen its combat power, the Air Force needed to replenish equipment and train operational personnel. After the Yangtze River traffic was cut off, the main source of equipment had to rely on the Northwest International Route. You can imagine driving unfamiliar planes on unfamiliar international routes, flying over thousands of miles of desolate, uninhabited desert. The climate was harsh and unpredictable, and there were no landmarks to be found on the surface. Just picking up the planes that the friendly nations handed over to us at the border was already extraordinarily difficult. Moreover, during the training and replenishment period, we were still constantly striking the enemy on the journey.</p>
<p>Large Enemy Formations Invade Our Rear</p>
<p>In 1940, Germany relied on air power to destroy many small and weak countries in the European theater. The Japanese invaders, learning a lesson from this fact, vainly tried to emulate it, attempting to eliminate our will to fight by using Douhet's doctrine. From spring to autumn, they constantly used large formations of over a hundred planes to bomb Chongqing, the center of our resistance, and occasionally used smaller formations to harass other important cities in our rear. When Yichang, a vital point on the Yangtze River, fell in June, the enemy planes used Yichang as a forward base, attacking various routes at any time, making the air defense situation even worse. At that time, our air defense units were in an extremely difficult environment. However, the brave men of our fighter squadrons still relied on a spirit of fearless courage to do everything possible to deal with the enemy.</p>
<p>During this same period, the bomber units did not abandon their responsibilities either. Although the number of planes was not large, the battle record was not bad.</p>
<p>After this, from the winter of 1940 to the first half of 1941, news of the Air Force subsided again. At this time, our ally, the United States, had originally promised to provide us with a large amount of aircraft and equipment, but because the Burma Road was blocked for a period of time, it could not be transported in. Moreover, after the Japanese invaders took advantage of France's defeat and occupied Vietnam in one fell swoop, the number of air raids on our southwest regions gradually increased. The fighter squadrons, which were originally small in number, naturally felt even weaker when they were dispersed for use at this time. This period, from the second half of 1940 to the first half of 1941, was perhaps a relatively dark period. However, this darkness was only a brief phenomenon before dawn. After the darkness was broken, dawn followed closely.</p>
<p>Entering a New Stage: Eliminating the Threat of Enemy Planes</p>
<p>From the second half of 1941, the Chinese Air Force's war of resistance entered a new stage. Wasn't air supremacy regained? Since then, wasn't the airspace over the entire Chinese theater of war controlled more firmly than at any time in the past? In the following years, except for a very few places and extremely rare cases, the people across the country were no longer threatened by enemy planes and no longer disturbed by air raids.</p>
<p>During this period, everything was improving. First of all, a large amount of aircraft and equipment were transported from the United States to the Chinese mainland. Immediately after, the Chinese Air Force American Volunteer Group was established in Kunming, fighting alongside us and taking on the task of protecting the southwest international route. Then, on December 8th, 1941, the war between the United States and Japan broke out. The material and spiritual help that the United States gave us was more active than before. Land transportation was insufficient, so air transport was added. From then on, we were no longer fighting alone, but were a member of the entire war against Axis aggression.</p>
<p>After this, our pursuit units had become aerial guerrillas. Wherever enemy planes flew, we chased them. The strength of the Japanese Air Force gradually weakened, and the air defense of our rear became increasingly solid. After this, they no longer dared to risk invading.</p>
<p>American Air Force Officially Established in China</p>
<p>As time entered 1943, the Chinese Air Force's combat operations began to enter a new golden age.</p>
<p>First of all, we should thank our American allies. On March 10th, 1943, the U.S. Army 14th Air Force was officially established in China, fighting alongside the Chinese Air Force. In terms of equipment, the United States was doing its best to supply us according to the Lend-Lease Act. Our air force units had gradually equipped themselves with state-of-the-art American-made aircraft, gaining an absolute advantage in air warfare. In terms of training, the allies were also using their excellent environment, excellent equipment, and technology to share our hard work. After completing training at American Army Air Force bases, many batches of the most outstanding Chinese aviation students immediately returned to their homeland and took to the air battlefield.</p>
<p>Due to the increased strength of our Air Force, it also performed exceptionally brilliantly in battle.</p>
<p>In this year, the fighter squadrons, due to the enemy's shrinking back, could not show their skills in defense, so they bravely and continuously launched attacks, taking on the task of offense. In addition to regularly covering bomber units departing for combat, they also carried small bombs to patrol the skies above the battlefields at any time, dive-bombing enemy troops, vehicles, ships, and supplies on the ground, and delivering ammunition and supplies to ground troops besieged by the enemy. Among them, the most world-shaking and well-known achievements were Captain Zang Xilan's daring rescue of allied Lieutenant Colonel Allison over enemy lines on May 31st, and Major Zhou Zhikai's single-handedly shooting down three enemy planes (a small squadron) over Liangshan base on June 6th. The former was a testament to the noble virtue of the Chinese Air Force's tradition of chivalry, selflessly saving comrades. The latter showed that the Air Force's morale was still high, and technically, it was still defeating the many with the few.</p>
<p>Air Force: A Mixed Sino-American Force</p>
<p>In addition to the U.S. 14th Air Force stationed in China, another powerful air force on the Chinese battlefield, the Sino-American Composite Wing, was officially established on November 6th, 1943. This was a purely offensive air force, possessing the latest large number of aircraft, and composed of a mixture of Chinese and American pilots. The Wing's first achievement was a surprise attack with the U.S. 14th Air Force on the Japanese military base in Taiwan, the Xinzhu Airfield, and the implementation of sweeping bombings along the southeast coast. The enemy ships sunk in the first fifty days alone reached over 30,000 tons.</p>
<p>Concentrated Attacks: The War Situation Immediately Stabilized</p>
<p>From early summer to late winter of 1944, the situation on the Chinese battlefield was indeed at its worst. The enemy transferred elite Kwantung Army troops from Manchuria from afar, making a last-ditch struggle in the Central Plains and Hunan-Guangxi battlefields, vainly attempting to open up the so-called "continental transportation line" to reduce the threat to it from the Allied offensive in the Pacific.</p>
<p>First, the enemy launched the Central Plains campaign, with the main purpose of opening up the Pinghan Railway Line. We do not deny that in the initial battles, the enemy made progress. However, since April 28th, when our Air Force completed its concentration and began operations, the war situation immediately stabilized.</p>
<p>Zhihang Squadron Creates a History of Complete Victory</p>
<p>The fact that the isolated army in Hengyang was able to hold out for forty-seven days was also due to the strong support of the Air Force. What is even more commendable is that in the battles to support the Hengyang garrison, the Air Force's Zhihang Squadron created two completely victorious battles of the annihilation type.</p>
<p>While the Zhihang Squadron was fighting, the Air Force's Fifth Group was carrying out strategic missions in the Hunan war zone, flying over 1,500 sorties from early May to late August.</p>
<p>New Aircraft Replenishment: Developing Long-Range Air Force</p>
<p>Last year was the year the Chinese Air Force faced the victorious end of the entire national war of resistance.</p>
<p>The battles in northern Hubei and southwestern Henan, the battle for our army's base in western Hunan, and the counter-offensive in Guilin-Liuzhou-Nanning were several major military events on the Chinese battlefield this year. Our Air Force not only actively participated but also unleashed its amazing power.</p>
<p>As the situation in western Hunan turned from danger to safety and the National Army's counter-offensive in Guangxi progressed steadily, the Air Force's Second Group took on the task of coordinating with the ground army's operations.</p>
<p>In addition, in early spring of last year, our Air Force fighter squadrons received a batch of new long-range aircraft from our ally, the United States, developing several powerful long-range units. As a result, the major cities and military strongholds in the North China and Central China regions, which had been occupied by the enemy for many years, were also generally attacked by our aircraft, inflicting fatal wounds on the enemy. The more notable achievements were: five attacks on Wuhan, four attacks on Beijing and Shanghai, one bombing of the Dagukou oil depot, and one destruction of the Taiyuan arsenal.</p>
<p>National Reconstruction Period: Rapidly Building Air Defense Forces</p>
<p>Having described the history of the Chinese Air Force's valiant struggle, we believe that the Chinese Air Force played a role as an immortal protagonist in the eight years of the war of resistance. However, the people of the country should not be satisfied with this. The world has entered the age of aviation. If we want to catch up with the times and consolidate our country's strong position in the period of national reconstruction, we must build a new national defense force. We must use the power of the entire nation to assist the government in promoting the Air Force's glorious achievements in the past and build a stronger and more powerful Air Force.</p>

<h3 id="e40">Lamentable Refugee Songs: The Bitter Tale of Yangzhou with Water, Air, and Fire <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>— Zhiliang, Reporting from Northern Jiangsu</p>
<p>The people of northern Jiangsu, who have suffered under the enemy and puppet regime, fully believed that peace and happiness would come with victory. Who knew that the Communist Party, disregarding the Supreme Commander's order to "remain stationed in place and await orders," would implement its consistent policy of expanding territory and seeking chaos? This led to the entire northern Jiangsu area falling into a state of chaos. Countless cities and towns were attacked by the Communist army, countless people died in the gunfire, young people fled to other places, and the weak died unattended. Recently, Yancheng fell, Gaoyou was besieged, and Yangzhou and Taizhou were under attack from all sides. Gunfire could be heard within the city, and the situation was tense and frightening.</p>
<p>Embarking on a Journey: A Deep Inspection of Northern Jiangsu</p>
<p>To understand the actual situation in northern Jiangsu, the reporter changed his original plan to spend the first Christmas after the victory celebrating at the Confucius Temple. On the morning when the dignitaries were eating turkey and welcoming Santa Claus around the Christmas tree, I embarked on a journey to Yangzhou, an important town in northern Jiangsu, for a deep inspection. I will now report my observations to the people of the country who are concerned about the current situation in northern Jiangsu.</p>
<p>On the day the reporter arrived in Yangzhou, entry into the city was prohibited due to a household registration check. At the same time, the sound of engines whirred as our planes flew over northern Jiangsu for reconnaissance. It was only two hours later that I took a detour to my residence. On the streets, the National Army had just completed its work of eliminating traitors, and the Communist soldiers who had infiltrated the city had all been brought to justice. The reporter was excited at the time and drove to visit an elder of the local area.</p>
<p>Freezing Cold: The Old and Young Struggling to Flee</p>
<p>He told the reporter very kindly: "These days, northern Jiangsu is indeed very panicked. Shaobo has fallen, Gaoyou is in imminent danger, and the south gate is filled with dead and wounded. The old and young are struggling to flee, the weather is freezing cold, and it is truly a tragic scene. I heard that the Communist Party has gathered a large army and is advancing towards Bubo, Taixian, and the Yangzhou-Taizhou highway. Wherever they go, villages are reduced to rubble, and the people are coerced into serving them to achieve their ambition of expanding their power and occupying all the uncaptured cities in northern Jiangsu before the Political Consultative Conference, forming the so-called "Jiangsu-Anhui Border Region Government." However, he said with firmness and conviction, Yangzhou and Taizhou will be safe, and Gaoyou, Yancheng, and other places will soon be recovered because the National Army is rushing to the scene day and night, their morale is high, and these jumping clowns cannot use their petty tricks. This can be reported to the people of northern Jiangsu who are abroad."</p>

<p>— Qian Pei, Special Correspondent for This Newspaper, Reporting from Taipei</p>
<p>This is the first dispatch since the reporter arrived here. The area observed in the past ten days or so is limited to Taipei and Keelung. My presentation of the government's policies and measures, as well as the people's hardships, will only be a superficial presentation. However, examining the entire picture from this small aspect should be possible.</p>
<p>Aviation Mail Lacks Management: Hong Qiao's Delay</p>
<p>The most frustrating thing the reporter has felt in the ten days or so since arriving here is that Taiwan seems completely isolated from the mainland or can be regarded as a utopia, or a solitary island. Not everyone can travel by plane, and shipping is not yet smooth. It took many days after the reporter arrived here for the letters I sent to my friends in the East to be received, or some were not received at all. This is because the aviation mail often has no one to take care of it at the airport. The mail transferred from the Shanghai Liaison Office of the Taiwan Administrative Governor's Office was often taken to Manila and other ports in the South Seas by American planes on their second arrival in Taiwan. By the time the mistake was discovered and sent back, more than a month had passed. The reporter received his first family letter, which was an express airmail letter sent from Shanghai on December 13th, half a month apart. Although it does not conform to reason and law, it is already very fortunate. The saying "Beacon fires last for three months, a family letter is worth ten thousand gold" is exactly what it feels like.</p>
<p>Unfamiliar with Taiwanese and Japanese: Almost Like a Mute</p>
<p>After arriving here, the language barrier is also a reason for travelers to feel homesick. Japanese and the Hokkien dialect of Xiamen are commonly used here. It is difficult to find one in a hundred people who can understand Mandarin. Therefore, every time I go out, I have to pull along someone who speaks Japanese or Hokkien to act as an interpreter. Whether I am calling a car or shopping, I feel like a mute who cannot express himself.</p>
<p>All Personnel Going to Taiwan: Prohibited from Carrying Legal Tender</p>
<p>The surge in prices in recent months is indeed a fact. However, the authorities' willingness to spare no effort to prevent the impact of inflation from other provinces in the country on Taiwan can be said to have achieved considerable success. In the beginning, when the National Army first arrived, there were incidents of coercing and forcing the use of legal tender, which aroused resentment and resistance from the Taiwanese people. Later, the practice of prohibiting personnel coming to Taiwan from carrying national currency and continuing to use Taiwan Bank's Taiwan currency was put into place, and the turmoil subsided. After this, the Central Bank sent more than 40 staff members to Taiwan, intending to establish a branch here. However, because there was no prospect of business development, they all soon bought boats and returned home. Therefore, there are rumors outside that Governor Chen of Taiwan is blockading Taiwan and closing it off. Adding to this the blockage of transportation and the disruption of aviation and mail, not only people outside the province are talking about it, but even ordinary residents here feel the same way. Thinking about it calmly, the non-circulation of national currency and the temporary non-establishment of a Central Bank branch have indeed prevented inflation in this province. Otherwise, the high prices here would not know how high they would go.</p>
<p>Any Cargo Entering: No Restrictions</p>
<p>Furthermore, under the Administrative Governor's Office, there is a trading company that specializes in the import and export of controlled goods. At present, there are no restrictions on anything being shipped in. However, only food and fertilizer are encouraged to be imported. The absolute prohibition of export is rice because the rice produced in this province this year is not enough for the local people's food needs. Therefore, imports are encouraged and exports are prohibited. Sugar can be exchanged for grain and fertilizer. Rock sugar and square sugar cannot be freely exported and must be exchanged at value with the Taiwan Trading Company. Coal is semi-controlled. Coal production is lower than before, so various public, public, and factories in the province are in urgent need of coal. Therefore, it must be restricted, but not absolutely prohibited from export. However, in fact, there is no profit to be made from exporting coal unless shipping is developed in the future. Although the price of coal is only 200 Taiwan dollars per ton (equivalent to 40 to 50 national currency), the black market water fee is 5,000 yuan per ton (over 100,000 national currency). If counterfeit currency is added, it reaches 20 to 30 million per ton.</p>
<p>Regarding the contents of the Taiwan Trading Company, the reporter has not yet conducted a detailed investigation, so I will leave it aside for the time being. How the exchange prices of food, fertilizer, and sugar are set, and whether the trading company is truly as the authorities say, not competing with the people for profit, returning every bit to the public, and taking from the people and returning to the people, cannot be discussed for the time being.</p>
<p>High-Ranking Officials Taking Prostitutes as Concubines: Listed as Secretaries</p>
<p>Furthermore, there is something else to report to the people of the country. The takeover work here is also quite chaotic. Some say it is not as bad as in the mainland. The competition between the central government's special representatives and the Administrative Governor's Office is fierce, and they tend to flock to where the profits are. The strange things the reporter has heard and seen are endless. A certain high-ranking central official used a Japanese person to handle the takeover, causing a big joke. There are also various tricks regarding officialdom. A certain official took a prostitute as a concubine, listed her as a secretary, and actually took office. However, he has been given a penalty of dismissal and investigation. There are also those who have been reprimanded by the Administrative Governor for liking to dance. There are all kinds of things. The fact that the private lives of public officials cannot fully satisfy the people, or give the Taiwanese people a chance to doubt and despise them, is also an undeniable fact. However, I heard that Administrative Governor Chen Yi has the intention of rectifying officialdom and working hard to govern. Writing this far, I conclude with infinite emotion.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3 id="e42">Stale Views of Chinese and Foreigners <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>After eight years of arduous struggle and bloody battles by the Chinese military and civilians, and four and a half months since the enemy surrendered and victory was celebrated, China should be a new, independent, and sovereign nation. With unequal treaties abolished and the United Nations organization about to be established, China should especially be a new, independent, and sovereign nation, not only as a member of the democratic nations' camp during and after the war, but also as one of the so-called four or five powers. However, it is strange that in official circles and society, many glaring actions are still unconsciously revealed, as if China were still a semi-colonial country, the same as before it contributed, fought, and bled. Especially in Shanghai, this city, the so-called concession of the five treaty ports in a century of humiliation, the overbearing foreign bosses, and the obsequious compradores are still strikingly visible today. Perhaps some friendly people who have been in China for a while still have a sense of racial superiority in their hearts; and after a century of humiliation, some Chinese people inevitably still have some inferiority complexes. These two psychological factors intertwined result in many distressing facts. For the sake of the construction of a new China and to genuinely enhance friendship between China and foreign countries, we must clarify some stale views of both Chinese and foreign people.</p>
<p>Let's cite a few examples: For instance, at the San Francisco conference last year, Chinese language was listed as one of the common languages, which shows that it is a matter of course to use Chinese language in official documents in China. For the convenience of international exchange, it is okay to attach translations and speak some foreign languages. But it is unnecessary to say that only those who can speak foreign languages and understand foreign texts are qualified in Chinese officialdom and society. Some time ago, a foreigner wrote an article and recklessly criticized, saying that a certain official was not proficient in English and lacked qualifications, which was already extremely strange, and yet some Chinese people echoed his words. Well, then, are the officials in major trading ports in Europe and America proficient in Chinese? Also, for the convenience of liaison with friendly countries in post-war relief work, it is only natural to recruit talents, especially those who are proficient in foreign languages. But as rumors circulate, saying that foreigners cannot trust our Chinese officialdom, especially local governments, so everything must be done by breaking away from the existing government institutions, starting everything from scratch, and even distributing relief and dispensing favors must rely on foreigners. Such an attitude is simply undervaluing oneself too much. If such a mentality prevails, the result will inevitably be a society where compradores are still in power, and the Chinese people will still be stuck in the stage of depending on the whims of foreign bosses.</p>
<p>I heard that the Enemy and Puppet Property Management Bureau recently seized a batch of newspapers, about two or three hundred bundles, in a warehouse in Shanghai. According to people from the Naval Headquarters, the total number is more than two thousand bundles. The exact number has not yet been announced by the bureau. They are about to be distributed and sold to newspapers to alleviate the paper shortage. But a certain Swedish came out and said that he bought these papers from the Japanese, and the ownership should belong to him. As a result, the bureau has delayed the distribution and sale. We want to ask: When the enemy puppets controlled paper in Shanghai, which Japanese person could sell paper? And after August 10th, by what right did the Swedish person have to buy paper from the Japanese? We cannot fail to investigate these matters clearly just because a foreigner is involved.</p>
<p>What is most incomprehensible is that recently, the French warship "Berdin" actually took prisoners away from Shanghai without authorization, claiming that the French Consul General still holds consular jurisdiction. According to this statement, it seems that French officials still do not treat us as equals. We recall how France treated us during the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, which is truly heartbreaking. The Vichy government of Pétain and the Annam government of Decoux helped the Japanese to invade China. They blockaded the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway, and signed a treaty with the Japanese to sacrifice Annam, allowing the Japanese to use Annam as a springboard to attack Yunnan, Guangxi, and invade the Pacific. The Chinese truly felt like drinking cold water in the cold winter, every drop painful. How they colluded with the enemy puppets in Shanghai to oppress the good people of China should not be forgotten by the citizens of Shanghai. The current French government has signed a new treaty of equality with our country. Even if it has not yet been signed, does France still want to show the evil face of old imperialism in China, acting arbitrarily and damaging China's sovereignty? If that is really the case, no wonder General Hurley said that there are still some imperialists in the Far East! China does not want to take advantage of others, but at least China should not bow its head to others for no reason today. We believe that the wise French government and far-sighted French people will certainly not let these stale ideas forever blind the hearts of a few of their lagging followers.</p>
<p>What is most unacceptable is that some people in Shanghai seem to have forgotten the suffering of Chinese and foreigners when the Japanese occupied the city, and instead are more critical of the Chinese government after the victory, demanding perfection and criticizing it more and more. According to these people's thinking, would they rather invite the Japanese to slaughter and rule us again! Please ask yourselves: What was the life of Shanghai citizens like during the occupation, in terms of food, clothing, housing, and transportation? What was the life of foreigners like? Today, under the management of the National Government and the Shanghai Municipal Government, no matter how unsatisfactory it may be to you, there is always enough rice to eat, cloth to buy, houses no longer need to be demolished or seized by the enemy, and you no longer need to pay tolls when walking. In Shanghai over the past two or three months, we have only heard strange words like "Shanghai people" and "Chongqing people," but we must know that traitors or quasi-traitors who depend on the enemy cannot be forgiven just because they are "Shanghai people," and cannot transform themselves into loyal and steadfast men just because they also join the "Shanghai people" in cursing the "Chongqing people."</p>
<p>We must recognize one major thing, that is: China is now a new, independent, and sovereign nation, a new nation that stands on an equal footing with any country in the world. This independent, equal, and sovereign international position is more than one hundred and eight thousand miles away from a semi-colony. We must not allow the slave mentality of a semi-colony for a hundred years to bind ourselves again! We must give the great credit for winning independence, equality, and sovereignty to the military and civilians who endured eight years of hard struggle against Japan, and it is the National Government we support that led the anti-Japanese war to victory.</p>

<h3 id="e43">Rumors of Foreign Exchange Listing Abound, Gold and Banknotes See Decline, Securities Market Continues to Be Strong <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>Spot exchange started stably yesterday, but because the expected listing problem during the closure period was not realized, many parties closed their positions, and buying interest was frustrated. As a result, after the highest price of 815,000, supply consistently exceeded demand. However, it struggled at the 800,000 mark in the middle. Finally, as the U.S. dollar continued to decline, many long positions collapsed at noon. Rumors spread that the U.S. dollar listing was divided into four levels from 1,000 yuan to 1,600 yuan, and the factory material demand was set at 1,200 yuan. Selling interest suddenly soared, once seeing around 777,000. In the afternoon, it hovered around 785,000. As a result, it fell 19,000 compared to before the closure. Gold jewelry was listed at 84,000, silver taels at 600 yuan, and silver coins hovered around 430. The dark exchange rate stood at around 10% because of slightly more demand.</p>
<p>Due to the closure, small money changers' retail income was quite large. Spot goods were sold off. The listing was not implemented. People's hearts were already depressed. After an initial 1,435 yuan in the morning, the U.S. dollar gradually declined. At noon, there were rumors of U.S. dollar listing divided into four levels from 1,000 to 1,600, with the second level for legitimate factory needs set at 1,200. The 1,400 mark was broken, falling below 1,380. It gradually stabilized in the afternoon. As a result, it recovered 30 yuan compared to the end of last year. The street currency saw increased selling as the local Shanghai exchange rate rose. It weakened from firm. Old currency fell 5 yuan, and new currency fell a little more than 4 yuan.</p>
<p>Government bonds still saw active trading by silver shops' surplus funds. Type C was once pushed to a high price of 880. Industry insiders sold off at high prices. There was a slight recovery at noon. As a result, it was 30 to 90 yuan better than before the closure. Because of the air of intervention by the authorities, Chinese stocks initially showed fear and fatigue. New Guang once retreated to within 50 yuan, Yongsha fell to 830 yuan, and Meiya within 620 yuan. Large investors undermined the market. Gradually, the stocks rallied near noon. Securities brokers came to hype the market at noon, and it became strong again. Yongsha rose to 930 yuan, and Meiya pushed to the 700 yuan mark. Finally, there were slight profit-taking at high prices, and a slight downturn was seen. A portion of the surplus funds in the industry had a tendency to shift to the gold market, and the trend became erratic. As a result, stocks were mixed compared to last year. Various unpopular stocks showed different results due to varying preferences of surplus funds. Foreign stocks continued to rise, while unpopular stocks slightly declined. On the whole, the number of rises still exceeded the number of falls. Compared to before the closure, Yisha rose 50 yuan, Yipi 70 yuan, Paper Industry 85 yuan, Asia rose 30 yuan, British Alliance 50 yuan, and Ken Zhi 20 yuan, which were still buying prices. Various rubber stocks continued to advance.</p>

<p>The rice market remained calm in digestion. Although the owners were firm, they were unable to boost the market. The market situation was similar to the closing price at the end of the year. However, Xian rice was scarce and slightly outstanding. The Fujian gang took over the flour business, and the market trended stable. Oil shops took advantage of the opportunity to take delivery. The market turned from weak to strong, recovering several hundred yuan. Soybeans were slightly tight. Nanyang continued to handle soybean cakes. The situation was still active, and prices rose slightly. Raw peanuts were selling well in winter, rising another thousand yuan. The wine market was stable.</p>

<p>The coal market saw strong real sales. All goods generally rose. White coal screened lumps continued to sell well. The inventory was insufficient. New highs were created. The previously depressed white coal dust also followed suit and began to rebound. Coking coal lumps were selling well to users, and the market prospects improved. Coking coal dust only saw slight inquiries from small factories. The market price was stable. Firewood and charcoal benefited from the rise in the coal market and northwest winds, and ship arrivals were not strong. The market followed and firmed up.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the yarn market rose in a straight line. All kinds of merchant gangs gathered, and buying interest remained strong. The Hong Kong and Guangdong gangs were still actively searching for 20-count Double Horse yarn, starting at 750,000 and gradually rising to 790,000 at the close. People's hearts were buoyant and not discouraged by the mediocre gold prices. According to statistics, large 20-count yarn and fine yarn rose 100,000, ordinary 20-count yarn rose 50,000 to 60,000, and 16-count and 10-count yarn only rose 30,000. There was still a shortage of fine goods. Production will only increase after a large amount of American cotton arrives at the port.</p>

<h3 id="e49">The Enamel Industry in Shanghai <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>Enamel is the common name for enamel. It is impossible to know exactly when and where it was invented. In the 19th century, Germany and Austria began to have enamel industries. Later, the United States made extraordinary efforts to study this industry and made rapid progress. Japan began to promote this industry between the 41st and 42nd years of the Meiji era. It was most developed during the First World War. China's Jingtai blue was invented very early, but the real enamel industry has only existed since the Republic of China.</p>
<p>The history of the enamel industry in Shanghai is only about 30 years, but its development is truly astonishing. Recalling the early years of the Republic of China, Yao Mulin and others founded the China Fine Arts Enamel Company and hired Liu Dasan, an engineer who had studied in Austria, to take charge. Not long after the opening, it was hit by the European war, and raw materials could not be imported, so it was unable to start work, so there were no products to the world. Seeing no achievements, Liu and Liu Dongqing reorganized the China Fine Arts Enamel Company into the Gefeng Enamel Company, set up a factory and started work, imitating Japan, and gradually had products. This was the beginning of Shanghai having a formal enamel factory. In the early days of Shanghai's enamel factory, almost all raw materials were imported from foreign countries. The so-called enamel factory was only a processing and manufacturing facility. In the years 13 and 14 of the Republic of China, although there were methods of making enamel domestically, the results were still mediocre and far inferior to foreign goods. After the National Revolutionary Army established itself in Shanghai, various enamel factories already had a considerable foundation, and new factories were also established one after another. From then on, there was progress every year, and business also developed accordingly. Therefore, in terms of actual sales, domestic enamel occupied the first place, and imported goods almost disappeared, recovering interests, which was truly not a small amount. Since the outbreak of the all-out war of resistance, it was not easy to concentrate talents and add raw materials due to the environment, so there was no development to speak of. After the outbreak of the Pacific War, it was completely shut down. After the victory news came, the Yisheng Enamel Factory was the first to fully resume work. Its products were more refined than before, and almost all daily enamel products were available. Later, Jiufeng and Jiuxin also resumed work one after another.</p>
<p>Enamelware can be divided into several categories:</p>
<p>(1) Hollow enamelware for household use</p>
<p>(2) Enamelware for chemical use</p>
<p>(3) Steam and other enamel tubes</p>
<p>(4) Water pipes and enamel pipes for water leakage</p>
<p>(5) Enamel signs</p>
<p>Among them, the most widely used is the first item, which comes in many varieties, such as washbasins (which can be divided into flat-edged, turned-over, deep-shaped, and rolled-edged, etc.), spittoons (which can be divided into bottle-shaped, persimmon-shaped, and ordinary, etc.), pots (including rice pots, soup pots, etc.), cups (ordinary and machine-made), buckets, bedpans, wash tubs, tea trays, vegetable basins, rice bowls, coffee pots, stew wine pots, kerosene stoves, water bottles, soap dishes, and all kinds of floral and plain food baskets, etc. Almost all kinds of household utensils are available in enamelware. Because it is lightweight, clean, and durable, it is welcomed by modern families, and the original utensils have been gradually eliminated.</p>
<p>The use of enamel is so broad, but there are very few complete enamel factories in Shanghai. The names of the members who have joined the guild are listed below in order of their founding year:</p>
<p>Factory Name, Factory Address, Manager</p>
<p>Zhufeng, Binlang Road, Tong Jitong</p>
<p>Yifeng, Fanhangdu, Dong Jifu</p>
<p>Zhonghua, Xiaoshadu Road, Fang Jiangge</p>
<p>Huafeng, Mabai Road, Li Zhishi</p>
<p>Jiuxin, Sapo Sai Road, Qian Zongjian</p>
<p>Jiufeng, Hede Road, Xu Langxing</p>
<p>Yisheng, Kangnao Tuo Road, Wu Huangxiang</p>
<p>The above companies are all organized as joint-stock companies. In addition to those who have not joined the guild, there are more than ten companies such as Daxin, Dafeng, Guanghua, Chengfeng, Hefeng, and Nanhua.</p>
<p>China's industry has always been considered backward, but the enamel industry is an exception. Over the past 20 years, it has progressed by leaps and bounds, which is unimaginable to outsiders. The Japanese have done everything possible to seize China's commercial field, but they have no room to intervene in the enamel industry, which is also enough to console us. (Yang Kangnian)</p>
<h3 id="e50">Asphalt Sales Strong, Prices Stable <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>Asphalt is in the middle of its peak season, and the market is gradually stabilizing. The production of Jinlan and other places is not strong, so the transportation to Shanghai has long since disappeared, and the arrival of goods in Shanghai is becoming less and less. It is heard that the hemp asphalt concentrated in Hankou has other sales channels and can be temporarily prevented from being transported to Shanghai. However, the Shanghai market only has candle and Tao uses, which is not as complicated as soap making. Therefore, although the market is firm, it is not easy to see it rise. However, it is stable and more than sufficient. The current price of each line is 21,000 yuan for Heben, 18,000 yuan for Gaolan oil, slightly down to 16,000 yuan, and 15,000 yuan for Chen Macheng oil.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the Three Beauty Wheel loaded a large number of relief supplies. The Fulai Company's West Deng, the President Company's Jonesman Te, and the American Steel Company's Lante Jie Fantuo transported a large number of relief supplies. There were also more than 5,000 bales of cotton and more than 10,000 boxes of oil from Mobil and Texaco.</p>

<h3 id="e59">Zhejiang Province Education Restoration Requires at Least 4 Billion Yuan. Xu Shaodi Presents to the Ministry to Seek Additional Funding. <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>[Our Hangzhou Correspondent] When Minister Zhu visited Hangzhou last year, he verbally approved an allocation of 300 million yuan for Zhejiang Province's education restoration funds. The provincial government, following Minister Zhu's instructions, first allocated 50 million yuan for prioritized use. According to the Education Department, this small amount of funding is insufficient to restore the many public and private educational and cultural institutions in the province. The relocation, renovation, and equipment required for restoration are all costly. Even with extreme austerity, at least 4 billion yuan is needed. This is a drop in the bucket and will not solve the problem. Director Xu Shaodi has telegraphed Minister Zhu, requesting additional funding and asking for it to be issued promptly so that the restoration work can be completed quickly. (Butterfly)</p>

<h3 id="e62">From the War of Resistance to Victory, Education in Fujian Cities and Other Places, One View <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>— Huang Chuiqing</p>
<p>During the War of Resistance, the northwest of Fujian Province was relatively safe, so many schools that were relocated from other places sought temporary refuge there. In order to meet various needs, the government also established other specialized schools there. Higher education in Fujian had always lagged behind, but this allowed it to become the leader in the southeastern provinces. In the eight years, four relocated schools arrived: National Jinan University, National Southeast Associated University (formerly merged with Yingshi University), National Zhongzheng Medical College, and Jiangsu College. Five new specialized schools were established: National Music College, National Maritime, Land, and Air School, Provincial Agricultural College, Provincial Medical College, and Provincial Normal College. Including the province's original four schools – National Xiamen University, Private South China Women's College of Arts and Sciences, Private Fujian School, and Private Union University – the province had a total of twelve schools above the specialized level. Most of them were scattered in remote areas of northwestern Fujian. The exterior was surrounded by high mountains and dense forests, limiting their view. The interiors had incomplete housing and poor equipment. For years, they struggled with disease and nature. The suffering experienced by the faculty and students cannot be described in words. After the victory of the War of Resistance, the schools changed frequently. In order to provide clarity to all parties, this document will summarize the distribution, equipment, and future restoration plans of each school over the years.</p>
<p>I. Overview of National Institutions</p>
<p>(I) National Xiamen University: At the beginning of the War of Resistance, the school was ordered to withdraw to Changting in western Fujian, so all books and instruments were complete. Since Mr. Sa Bendong took over as president, the school's affairs have progressed rapidly. Young people from all over Southeast China have flocked to it, and the school's reputation has risen steadily. The school has four colleges: Arts, Science, Law, and Commerce, of which the College of Science has the best performance. There are currently more than 2,000 students and more than 100 faculty members. This year, President Sa resigned due to official business, and his vacancy will be filled by Mr. Wa Deyeo, Dean of the School of Science. The school address is confirmed to be Xiamen, and first-year freshmen have already arrived in Xiamen early to register for classes. All personnel are scheduled to be completely relocated to Xiamen before July this year.</p>
<p>(II) National Jinan University: After the outbreak of the Pacific War, the entire school withdrew to Fujian, and the school site was temporarily selected in Tongyou Township, the suburbs of Jianyang in northern Fujian. The initial equipment was extremely rudimentary, but after several years of active improvement by President He Bingsong, it began to take shape. The school has three colleges: Arts, Science, and Commerce, with more than 1,300 students. After the end of the war, it was rumored that the school's permanent address would be moved to Shantou to facilitate overseas Chinese students from Fujian and Guangdong. Later, due to the requests of alumni from all over the world, the discussion was abandoned, and it has now been decided to move to Nanjing. However, before the school buildings are completed, classes will temporarily be held at the original Shanghai site this summer.</p>
<p>(III) National Music College: Established in the autumn of 1942, it was originally the Fujian Provincial Music Teacher Training Institute, and later expanded into a national specialized school. The school address is in Jishan, Yong'an, the wartime provincial capital of Fujian. It has two departments: undergraduate and normal. The departments are further divided into theory, composition, music, orchestral, and national music groups. The former presidents were Cai Jikun, Lu Qian, Liang Longguang, and Zhang Zhaohuan. The current president is the famous songwriter Tang Xueyong. The school has about 200 students, including many foreign professors. The school has sound musical equipment and the students are very active. After the war, it was reported that the college would be moved to Nanjing.</p>
<p>(IV) National Maritime School: In the autumn of 1944, in order to train talents for the construction of Taiwan and other maritime regions after the war, the central government ordered Mr. Zhang Zhaohuan to come to Fujian to prepare for the establishment of the school. He finally completed the preparations in a short period of time, selected Xianyou as the school site, and immediately began to enroll students. (Last year, the Ministry of Education appointed Liang Longguang as the president. Liang moved the school to Jiudu in Nanpi, southern Fujian, because he thought the local area would be difficult to develop.) The school is quite large in scale, with plans to establish four departments: administration, normal, technology, and special classes. Each department is further divided into groups. Currently, the administrative department only enrolls civil administration and education groups. The normal department has two groups: literature and history, and civic education (according to the current organizational change, the school will now operate a two-year and a five-year normal education department). Students are mainly from southern Fujian, and all expenses are covered by the school, so enrollment is extremely competitive. After the war, the school address was reported to be set in Taiwan.</p>
<p>(V) National Zhongzheng Medical College: The college was originally in Jiangxi. Last year, when southern Jiangxi was captured, it suddenly moved to Changting to hold classes. It has two departments: medicine and pharmacy. After the merger with the Yingshi University Medical College last year, the number of students increased to about 300. It is now about to move back to Jiangxi.</p>
<p>II. Overview of Private Institutions</p>
<p>(I) Private Union University: It is run by the church, established in the early Republic of China. The school address is in Kuiqi near Fuzhou. The school buildings are located on the mountainside facing the sea, which is extremely spectacular. After the War of Resistance, it was relocated to Shaowu, northern Fujian. The school has three colleges: Arts, Science, and Agriculture. There are more than 800 students. The principal is Mr. Lin Jingkuo. The school has rigorous curriculum, a strong atmosphere of reading and research, and its performance is the best among all private schools. This semester, a part of the school buildings in Shaowu was suddenly burned down, causing heavy losses. Due to the rampant plague in Shaowu, the entire school ended early on November 25 last year and moved out immediately. It is said that it will return to its original site this spring and start school.</p>
<p>(II) Private South China Women's College of Arts and Sciences: It is also run by the church. Before the war, it was located in Huqian Mountain, Fuzhou. It was relocated to Nanping in 1938. It has four departments: foreign languages, home economics, chemistry and biology. There are more than 200 students. The president, Ms. Wang Shijing, studied in the United Kingdom and the United States in her early years. Other professors are also mostly scholarly women. The school spirit is calm and simple, and the music equipment is very good. It is reported that the school ended at the end of last year and will move back to Fuzhou this semester.</p>
<p>(III) Private Fujian College: The school was established in 1912. Its predecessor was the Fujian College of Law and Politics. In 1931, it was renamed to its current name. The original site was in Baishui well, Fuzhou. During the war, it was relocated to Baiyundu, Minqing. It has three departments: law, politics, and economics, with more than 400 students. The president is Mr. Guo Gongmu, and the chairman of the board is Mr. Chen Peikun, a prominent gentleman from Fujian Province. Alumni are all over Fujian and cooperate very closely. In June of this year, Fuzhou was recaptured. The college was the first to move back to its original site, making it the first school in the country to restore its campus.</p>
<p>(IV) Jiangsu College: It was established by the War Zone Command to accommodate displaced students from various places. Its predecessors were the Suwan Institute of Technology and the Suwan College of Political Science. Later, it was separated from Anhui College and renamed to its current name. In 1943, the school address was moved from Chong'an to Sanyuan. The president is Mr. Zai Keguang, and the chairman of the board is Mr. Gu Zhutong. It has seven departments: foreign languages, politics, economics, mathematics and physics, mechanical engineering, literature and history, and administrative management, with more than 470 students. In recent years, the college has achieved remarkable results and has cultivated many young people in the southeastern provinces. The new school address has been selected in Yangzhou, and it will be moved this year.</p>
<p>III. Newly Established Institutions in Fujian Province</p>
<p>(I) Provincial Normal College: Established in 1940, the school address is in Shuinan, Nanping. It has seven departments: Chinese, history and geography, mathematics and science, education, physical education, and art. The purpose is to train secondary school teachers for the entire province. In recent years, the graduates of each session have performed very well in their services, and the school's reputation has been improved. The current president is Mr. Lin Xiqian (Speaker of the Fujian Provisional Senate), and the school has more than 400 students. The school address has been surveyed and determined to be Wushi Mountain in Fuzhou. The last semester ended on December 15, and all classes will be held in Fuzhou this semester.</p>
<p>(II) Provincial Medical College: Established in 1937, the school address is in the county seat of Shaxian. The entire college is a medical department, with a six-year study period. There are currently about 400 students, and the equipment is relatively complete. The students have a good atmosphere for research. In the performance assessments held by the Ministry of Education in the past, the college has always been among the best. The new school address is set to be Jixiang Mountain in Fuzhou and the college will move there soon.</p>
<p>(III) Provincial Agricultural College: Established in 1940, the school address is in Huangli, Yong'an. It has departments of horticulture, plant pathology and entomology, and forestry. There are currently more than 200 students. On the issue of the school address, students insist on moving to Fuzhou. However, the provincial government has not approved the move because it is worried that the educational institutions in the western Fujian area will be excessively impoverished in the future.</p>
<p>People in Fujian Province, in order to commemorate the late Chairman Lin, are discussing the combination of these three provincial schools into a National Linsen University, and are currently making various requests. It is expected that this will be realized soon.</p>
<p>Donghua has added the three musketeers Liu Xianhan, Song Lingsheng, and Zheng Yingquan this time, and the lineup can be said to have reached the ideal state. The Soviet Union has famous players from the former Shanghai Police Suker team, so their strength is still good. When they meet Donghua, they will definitely go all out. According to Jia Youliang, the lineup is roughly as follows:</p>
<p>Zhang Banglun, Liu Xianhan, Li Ning, Zhuang Youren, Song Lingsheng, Tan Fuzhen, Zhang Linggen, Zheng Yingquan, Li Yao, Sun Jinshun, Dai Linjing, Han Longhai, Jia Youliang, Chen Mingzhe</p>

<h3 id="e66">French Ship Illegally Transports War Criminal Abroad, Sino-French Friendship Affected, City Government Publicly Announces Protest Text, All Circles Advocate Effective Measures, French Consul-General Expresses Difficulty <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] This port's French consulate police illegally arrested French Nazi member Kakebinopino. Disregarding our country's protests, they set sail on the 3rd with the light cruiser "Bellet" after secretly detaining the criminal, which has drawn close attention from all circles, both Chinese and foreign. This reporter recently interviewed Lu Huaijun, secretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Shanghai Office, who informed me that all case files regarding this matter have already been compiled and submitted to Chongqing, and we are currently awaiting the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' decision. Mr. Lu stated: There are approximately 4,000 French troops and 600 French expatriates stationed in Shanghai. Before the French warship arrived in Shanghai, it reported to the city government according to the law, stating that its mission was to withdraw troops and expatriates. Unexpectedly, it engaged in the illegal act of escorting a criminal. This reporter subsequently learned from diplomatic circles in this city that if this incident is not resolved appropriately, French ships may encounter difficulties in the future when coming to Shanghai, and Sino-French relations and trade may suffer adverse effects. There is even a possibility that the French consulate in this city may be closed.</p>
<p>City Government's Protest Is Just and Forceful</p>
<p>The original text of the city government's protest to the French Consulate-General in Shanghai regarding the Kakebinopino case was published yesterday. The protest letter stated: "It is hereby noted that consular jurisdiction of all countries in China has been abolished. Your country's ambassador to China has notified our Ministry of Foreign Affairs that he has ordered the Consul-General in Shanghai to immediately close the consular court. However, this government has recently received reports that the Consul-General has independently arrested French Nazi citizens residing in Shanghai, Paul-Francois Kakebinopino de Sousli, etc., and plans to hand over Kakebinopino to the French warship recently docked in Shanghai and send him back to France in the near future. This government hereby informs your Consul-General that such actions are a clear and intentional sabotage of the abolition of extraterritorial rights, which our government should strictly prohibit. On the first day of this month, we sent a letter to our Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Shanghai Office to lodge a strong protest, requesting that the aforementioned criminal be handed over to our country's judicial organs for legal processing. Now, the Shanghai Office's letter No. Hu Er (35) 2 states: 'This office has prepared a strong protest letter, which Secretary Lu personally delivered to the French Consul-General in Shanghai at 4 PM this afternoon. In addition to receiving his promise to provide a written reply within days, he verbally stated: The Consul-General's office did indeed independently arrest a French Nazi citizen named Kakebinopino based on the consular jurisdiction stipulated in the old French treaty, and today it transported him to the docked French warship in accordance with French law, and will be transported back to France by the warship tomorrow or the day after. Now that it has received this office's protest regarding this case, it is willing to immediately telegraph the French Ambassador to China for instructions.' Later investigations revealed that this case was previously approved by your Consul-General's office's letter dated December 7, 34th year, which briefly stated: 'The French government intends to dispatch a warship to Shanghai in the near future, and pass through Shanghai and Saigon several times, in order to successively withdraw the French army stationed in Shanghai and French expatriates. It is not known whether your Mayor has any objections to the implementation of this plan. Please inform us immediately.' This was then telegraphed to the National Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which replied: 'The government has ordered French warships to come to Shanghai, with the task limited to withdrawing troops and expatriates,' and has replied to your Consul-General for verification. This warship is limited to withdrawing troops and expatriates. Now, it is escorting criminals, which is obviously beyond the scope of its assigned task. Now, since your Consul-General has agreed to immediately telegraph your country's ambassador to China for instructions, please be informed that the warship should be temporarily delayed from leaving the port until a proper solution is reached. Otherwise, your Consul-General should bear full responsibility for all consequences. Please investigate and act accordingly."</p>
<p>Social Organizations Advocate Serious Negotiations</p>
<p>Our country's diplomatic departments attach great importance to this case and will launch serious negotiations separately in Chongqing and Shanghai, striving to achieve a satisfactory solution. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Shanghai Office is now preparing to continue negotiations with the French authorities based on instructions from the Ministry after the Chongqing reply is received in Shanghai. Various social organizations in this area are also gathering to urge the government to lodge strong protests with the French side and take effective measures to safeguard the integrity of our country's sovereignty and legal rights. It is reported that Kakebinopino's crimes are quite similar to those of the British traitor Lord Haw-Haw, who was hanged. During the enemy puppet's occupation, he was driven to collect intelligence for the enemy and served as a broadcaster on Nazi radio, making distorted propaganda that was detrimental to the Allied countries.</p>
<p>French Consul-General Admits Lack of Familiarity</p>
<p>Regarding the French warship "Bellet" secretly transporting the French traitor Kakebinopino from Shanghai to Saigon for trial, which is a disrespect for our sovereignty and has aroused the attention of the general public here, this reporter specially visited Mr. Fei Lihao, the French Consul-General in Shanghai, yesterday afternoon to inquire about everything. Mr. Fei admitted that the warship did indeed depart from the Huangpu River at 9:50 AM on the 3rd and sailed to Saigon. Rear Admiral Felipe, the captain of the warship, was responsible for all actions of the warship, and the French traitor Kakebinopino was also escorted to Saigon by the warship. Mr. Fei expressed great regret for the occurrence of this incident but stated that he had only come here from Paris a month and a half ago and felt very unfamiliar with handling this matter.</p>
<p>French Government Has Not Given Instructions</p>
<p>However, to this day, he has not yet received a notice from the French government regarding China's abolition of consular jurisdiction, nor has he received instructions from the French government on how to deal with French traitors in Shanghai. The Shanghai Office of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs has lodged protests twice. Mr. Fei claimed that he felt caught in a dilemma. This reporter then asked Mr. Fei what measures he had to avoid the recurrence of such incidents. The French Consul stated: This is a one-time occurrence and will definitely be prohibited from happening again in the future to avoid damaging Sino-French relations. Yesterday morning, Chinese and English newspapers here all reported the ins and outs of the incident with large headlines. The French Consul believed that this was very fair reporting. In addition, this reporter asked Mr. Fei whether the rumors that the French side still retained several French traitors who had not been handed over to China were true. He strongly denied this, saying: The French side only arrested one French traitor, Kakebinopino.</p>

<p>The National Ship Allocation Committee has now opened a new Zhejiang-Fujian shipping route. A total of six ships are responsible for sailing on this route, each with a carrying capacity of approximately 700 tons, totaling approximately 4,000 tons. As for shipping between Shanghai and Fuzhou, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company will have the "Yinxian" and "Zhoushan" vessels, which originally sailed to Fuzhou, change their routes to Fuzhou in order to transport local goods from Fuzhou to Shanghai. The first departure is scheduled for tomorrow.</p>
<p>Salvaging the "Minyu"</p>
<p>At the end of last year, more than sixty American warships came to Shanghai to spend the New Year. At midnight on New Year's Eve and early on New Year's Day, they joined more than one hundred original resident warships to celebrate the New Year. It is learned that the warships successively left the port starting on the morning of the 3rd and sailed to the Bohai Sea and the South Seas to be stationed. Salvaging of the "Minyu" vessel began yesterday, and it can be salvaged within three to five days and then repaired at the dock. The Taikoo Company's "Wanliu" ship joined our country's restoration voyage after the victory. This time, it transported municipal government personnel from Chongqing to Beijing and is about to come to Shanghai, but the sailing date is uncertain. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's "Jiangshun" vessel berthed in Shanghai yesterday and is scheduled to sail to Hankou tomorrow morning, carrying relief supplies without passengers or cargo. The "Jiangping" vessel sailed upstream this morning, transporting 850 tons of coal from Qinhuangdao for transfer to Hankou. The "Changjiang" vessel will also sail to Hankou tomorrow morning. The repaired "Huayuan" is also scheduled to sail to Yichang tomorrow morning. Both vessels have a large amount of cotton yarn and piece goods to be transported to Yichang.</p>

<p>Recently, the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration reached an agreement with foreign shipping companies to transport relief supplies. The three labor unions of Marine Engineers, Drivers, and Seamen were very surprised after learning about this. They believed that maritime rights were not easy to recover, and if they were lost once, it would not only affect rights but also international relations. The three labor unions especially went to the Shipping Association yesterday to describe the matter. The association then convened a meeting of various organizing committee members for discussion. After deliberation, it was decided to send a telegram to the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Communications, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, hoping to respect maritime rights regarding entrusting foreign merchant ships to transport goods, stop the previous proposal, and instead use Chinese ships for transportation.</p>

<p>In order to report on the eight-year wartime dynamics of the Air Force, the Political Department of the Aviation Committee held a Chinese Air Force photo exhibition at the Daxin Company's 2nd floor from yesterday to the 9th, offering free admission to all sectors of society.

<h3 id="e73">Hu Xiyuan Discusses Unity in the Industrial Sector, There Should Be a Distinction in Foreign Exchange Settlement Prices <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Mr. Xiyuan, who has been engaged in the industrial sector for 20 years, established factories in the rear during the Anti-Japanese War and made great contributions to the country. This time he returned to Shanghai and was well-received by all parties. According to Mr. Hu, Shanghai's various factories should quickly resume work to reduce the serious unemployment problem. The factories in the rear were established to assist in the Anti-Japanese War, and collapsed one after another due to the sudden arrival of victory. The government should take on the responsibility of economic relief to solve their difficulties and enable these loyal industrialists to re-participate in future industrial construction. Chinese industry is not divided into front and rear; it is a whole, and should not be divided again to reduce strength. The process of industrialization is extremely difficult, and the national industrial sector should work together to develop it. If various environmental conditions cannot be coordinated, it is impossible to seek the independent prosperity of a factory. The issue of foreign exchange settlement prices is related to the life and death of the industrial sector. The Chongqing industrial sector has invited experts to discuss and discuss this matter many times, and they all believe that there should be a distinction in foreign exchange settlement prices for import and export and machine purchases. Because China's industry is immature, it is necessary to adopt special methods. As for foreign investment, cooperation, and technical cooperation, most Chinese industrialists have expressed their support, but they hope that the government will give strong support. I am the director of the National Industrial Restoration Committee. Once Shanghai's industry has been restored and developed again, I will go to other ports or return to Chongqing to report.</p>

<p>Shanghai Branch Distributes Old Clothes</p>
<p>A batch of old clothes automatically donated by people from the United States, Canada, Australia, and other places, including men's, women's, and children's clothing, has arrived in this port. Because these old clothes are donated, they are specifically for direct use by refugees and cannot be sold for cash. After the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration allocated part of them to the Shanghai branch for distribution to various charitable organizations, they were used to meet the winter needs of refugees. As of now, 630 bags have been distributed, each bag weighing 100 pounds. Most of them are distributed in their original bags.

<p>During the enemy-puppet era, Yang Jichang, who served as a police officer in the enemy's North Station Gendarmerie, not only arbitrarily embezzled all kinds of daily necessities from compatriots during inspections but also wantonly abused women, earning him the nickname "Demon of the North Station." After the Japanese surrender, Yang attempted to evade justice until mid-October of last year, when he was reported, arrested, and handed over to the city's gendarmerie. After being transferred to the High Procuratorate and found guilty, he was prosecuted by the High Court under Article 2 of the Regulations for the Punishment of Traitors. The High Court opened and concluded the trial twice. Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, Chief Judge Liu Yugui, Judge Cao Jun, and Prosecutor Xia Lusheng entered the court in succession.

Witness Ling Hu and others testified in court, proving that Zuo was indeed a translator for the Yamakyu Yoko company and that when the workers were unwilling to board the trucks and ships, Zuo even notified the enemy gendarmerie by telephone to send soldiers to escort the workers onto the trucks.

<p>[This Newspaper's Report] Yu Bingjian, Director of the Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau of the Ministry of Communications, has been rectifying the bureau since taking over. According to Mr. Zhong:</p>
<p>Commercial Telephone Repairs Temporarily Difficult to Complete</p>
<p>Since taking over the China Telecommunications Company from the enemy, this bureau has been actively reorganizing. However, because the telephone lines in various places have been in disrepair for a long time, they are unusable, and sometimes calls are difficult to complete. The reasons are as follows: (1) After the enemy forcibly occupied the Shanghai Telephone Bureau, they never repaired the telephone lines of the various bureaus for eight years, and the lines in various places are in terrible condition, causing frequent breakdowns. (2) Currently, due to a lack of communication materials, in addition to prioritizing the repair of telephones for military and government agencies, other commercial telephones are also being repaired one by one. However, the lines in various places are too damaged, and it may be difficult to complete the repairs completely in a short time.</p>
<p>Japanese Telephone Accounts Should Be Transferred Immediately</p>
<p>(3) Many users in the city have inherited telephones from Japanese personnel. According to regulations, they should go through the procedures for transferring accounts or installing connections, but they have not done so. Some have even moved the installations privately. However, the lines of these Japanese users have long been disconnected by this bureau, and they will not be reconnected without going through formal procedures. They are ignorant of the reasons, resulting in misunderstandings. (4) A small number of users in this city still do not know how to use the bureau's telephones, resulting in frequent inability to get through. However, when tested by this bureau, the lines are in good condition. According to regulations, when making calls within the various areas under the jurisdiction of this bureau, users only need to wait for the dial tone to directly dial the number. When making calls to users of the Shanghai Telephone Company, they can also automatically transfer the call. Under the control of the user, after hearing the dial tone in the receiver, first dial the number (0), and then wait for the dial tone of the Shanghai Telephone Company before dialing the desired number. If the two numbers are dialed continuously without waiting for the dial tone, users will inevitably fail to get through or connect to the wrong number. (5) When users of the Shanghai Telephone Company call telephones in the various areas under the jurisdiction of this bureau (i.e., telephones transferred from the "02" number), the calls are transferred by the operators of the Shanghai Telephone Company. The two bureaus rely on manual transfer in the middle, which often causes difficulties. This bureau has recently received much criticism, which is not the fault of this bureau.</p>
<p>Must Fill Out Form, Otherwise Phone Service Will Be Disconnected</p>
<p>(6) This bureau is currently reorganizing telephone users, investigating equipment, and transferring information to benefit users. All users who have received the telephone user investigation form should quickly send the completed form to the Business Section of this bureau on the third floor of No. 872 North Sichuan Road. If you currently have a telephone installed by this bureau but have not received the investigation form, please immediately request the form from the Business Section of this bureau to fill it out and submit it. If the investigation form has not been submitted by January 10, 1946, this bureau will consider that you do not need to continue the telephone service, and the telephone will be removed. (7) If users' telephones have malfunctions, dial (60060) for numbers beginning with (6), dial (70060) for numbers beginning with (7), dial (82060) for numbers beginning with (8), and dial (50060) for numbers beginning with (5) to notify the measuring stations, which can immediately test and send personnel to repair them. If you have not completed the formal procedures after the bureau took over, you must register with the Business Section of this bureau and pay the fees in order to be reconnected.</p>
<h3 id="e90">Preferential Treatment for National Army to View Plays: Movie Theaters Negotiate Methods; Plan to Rotate One Show Per Week Per Theater <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>[This Newspaper's Report] The movie theaters in this city have formulated considerable methods for preferential treatment for the National Army to view plays. According to Mr. Li Diyun, the general manager of Dahua Theater and the representative of the theaters, the theater authorities are very sympathetic to the hard work of the National Army during the eight-year war of resistance and their urgent need to obtain entertainment. They have repeatedly negotiated free methods with the British Eight Film Company. However, the film merchants firmly oppose free admission to the first-run films. The representatives also stated that if the theaters must provide free admission to the first-run films, the film merchants may stop supplying films here and withdraw the films that have already been distributed.</p>
<p>The method currently recommended by the theaters is to divide the forty-odd large and small theaters in the city into four groups of ten theaters each, totaling about one hundred seats each, distributed according to location. Each group will take turns providing free admission to the National Army one show per week, which means that each theater will provide free admission once per month on average. Colonel Wang, Deputy Director of the General Headquarters of the Songhu Garrison, also expressed his support for this proposal at the meeting of theater representatives yesterday. The National Army hopes to view plays at 12:00 noon every Sunday. The theaters plan to provide free admission every Saturday noon, with free tickets issued in advance. The National Army will be led by the commanding officer to the theater in order.</p>
<p>Mr. Li also scheduled to convene representatives of the theaters today to discuss everything and make a final decision. If the film merchants still insist that free admission is not allowed, the theaters may consider paying a considerable price to purchase the films for the National Army to view for free. If the film merchants can agree to all points, the above method can be implemented for a long time.</p>
<p>According to Mr. Howard, the U.S. Deputy Consul in Shanghai, the inability of the U.S. film merchants to agree to provide free plays to the National Army is also a last resort. British and American soldiers must also purchase tickets to go to the theaters. The National Army's treatment is lower, and a written proposal has been submitted to the military and government authorities to open the Hongkou district, where the municipal government can take over the theaters from the Japanese and the film merchants can supply second-run films for screening. Once the municipal authorities make a decision, it can be implemented.</p>

<h3 id="e91">My Opinion on Maintaining Order in Theaters <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>— Hao Shuicun</p>
<p>After reading the article "Who Maintains Order in Theaters" in the Shanghai Shen Bao's Free Discussion section on December 27, I was stirred to share some of my thoughts.</p>
<p>First of all, I want to declare to the readers that I am a soldier, and I am not in Shanghai but in Hangzhou. To prevent the issue of theater order from escalating in the future, I would like to analyze the causes of the conflict from a soldier's perspective and offer my humble opinions:</p>
<p>First, let's talk about the military side.</p>
<p>Mr. Junyang said, "Our soldiers indeed lack entertainment. There is simply no opera or movies to watch in the battalion, so they have to go to various theaters outside to seek entertainment." This is absolutely correct.</p>
<p>First, generally speaking, the officers have a very low level of knowledge. Besides fighting battles, exercising, and performing duties, their only forms of entertainment are gambling, whoring, or watching opera (they only know how to watch but not listen) and movies. Because they don't have colorful movies provided by the military every week like the American soldiers, or occasional dances. Apart from the political instructors telling them jokes and stories, the only way to pass the time in the barracks is to gamble secretly in groups of three or five, or find "lovers" near the garrison. But we all know that their treatment is quite poor, and their monthly income is very limited. They run out of money in three to five days, so how can they afford to "gamble" or pay to find "lovers"? Therefore, in this depressed environment, they cannot stay in the barracks. They have no chance to go out during the day, and they always want to find a chance to vent at night. There is no other way but to go to the lively Peking opera theater.</p>
<p>Second, it cannot be denied that the officers have some "arrogance." They always think that during the war of resistance, they shed blood and sweat, risking their lives to fight. Now that the Japanese devils have been defeated, it is naturally mostly due to the soldiers' efforts, and the common people should be more polite to the officers. Therefore, they feel uncomfortable when the people show them any slight disrespect and start to "get angry," leading to disagreements and even drawing swords.</p>
<p>Third, Shanghai is a place that makes people "panic." During the war of resistance, the officers mostly came into contact with places full of bomb craters, bullet marks, and desolate valleys, where there were more stones than people. They have tasted the hardships long ago. Now, they have survived by chance and come to this dazzling and eye-catching Shanghai, and they naturally become even wilder. As the saying goes, "Out of sight, out of mind." They have been sent to Shanghai, and their task is naturally to perform duties and guard the area. They probably don't even exercise during the day. If they have nothing to do, they will naturally want to go out for a stroll. But their pockets are empty, so where can they go? They are not qualified to go to dance halls, and they don't have money to go to restaurants, so they can only drool. They wander around on the streets without any ideas and end up listening to the loud drums and cymbals and watching the "stars" on stage to cheer them on. As a result, there are more and more officers in the theater.</p>
<p>Fourth, their treatment is too poor. Shanghai people probably don't know much about the poorest stage of soldiers. As for how poor it is, Shanghai people have never seen it, so we don't need to talk about it. Now, let's just talk about the "new salary" system: a soldier's salary is only a little over 1,200 yuan. According to Shanghai's prices, they have a maximum of only 400 to 500 yuan left each month after paying for food. Readers, think about it, what else can they buy besides soap for washing clothes and secretly smoking cigarettes? How can they afford to buy theater tickets? According to the rules, theaters are businesses, and if one or two people don't buy tickets, won't the theater operators have to starve? Therefore, in this contradictory situation, there are more and more problems.</p>
<p>Let's talk about the theater side:</p>
<p>First, people in Shanghai have always looked down on officers in "two-and-a-half-foot" uniforms and even despise them. To put it seriously, they simply "hate" them. Readers, don't think that I am exaggerating. I have facts to prove it.</p>
<p>I have a friend who went to a shoe store on Nanjing Road in Shanghai to buy leather shoes. He was wearing a gray military uniform and a small narrow belt (this was the wartime regulation that officers were not allowed to wear military belts). At first glance, he looked like a private (but he was actually a major). As soon as he entered the door, the clerks cast strange glances at him. When he said he wanted to see the goods, the clerks were reluctant to move and said indifferently, "These cost more than 10,000 legal tender!" My friend was a little offended, "What if it costs more than 10,000?" He was a little impatient. Then one of the clerks said, "I meant that the ones that cost 5,000 to 6,000 yuan are more economical for you soldiers." So that friend actually walked away. As soon as he walked out of the store, he heard one of the clerks inside say, "He's not here to buy leather shoes, he's just taking the opportunity to have some fun." He was a little angry when he heard this, but he finally endured it.</p>
<p>Second, most people in Shanghai are "tailor's eyes" (i.e., silk eyes), especially when they see people wearing dirty and old gray military uniforms. Furthermore, speaking with "thorns" is also the biggest cause of conflict. For example, the beating of Mr. Gu at the Victory Theater last time is the most obvious example. His first sentence, "We are all Chinese," was obviously a bit unpleasant. The second sentence, "It's not worth showing it to Japanese residents." These words with "thorns" are the biggest cause of conflict. It is often said that "A man lives for a breath, and a Buddha lives for a stick of incense." In public, why use these words with "thorns," which is equivalent to tearing off their face? Readers, think about it, people want face, and trees want bark, let alone this group of armed brothers with "arrogance"?</p>
<p>Third, there is a lack of preferential treatment for soldiers. We say preferential treatment, not giving them free shows every day, but that they should be treated with some consideration, and some extra seats should be set aside so that they also have the opportunity to have fun. No matter how you put it, you can't erase their more than eight years of hard work. It seems that the theater side has overlooked this point, and the local authorities have not noticed it either.</p>
<p>We have already pointed out the difficulties regarding the military and the theater, but naturally it is not complete. Here, I would like to supplement Mr. Junyang and think of a way to maintain order in the theater. Although this method is not clever enough and not thorough enough, I still hope that both the military and the theater can give it a try.</p>
<p>The Chinese people have always done things based on experience. They will never know how to improve without learning lessons from experience. Now, let's not talk about theories for the time being, but just focus on reality:</p>
<p>It is certainly not a solution for the person in charge of the theater to always be beaten; however, it is even worse for the soldiers to lose their temper and hit people. But if the theater side demands that the authorities "shut out" the soldiers for fear of being beaten, it is even more unreasonable, and it will cause problems that are many times more serious than beating people.</p>
<p>As for how serious it is, I am not intentionally "alarmist." Shanghai people have not yet experienced it, but people who run theaters in the rear areas know it, and have even tasted it. We believe that before the government completely solves the problem of soldiers' entertainment, I still hope that the people in charge of various theaters in Shanghai will not underestimate this point. At the same time, do not ask the local authorities to impose "heavy pressure" on the soldiers. Everyone should try to solve it from the root.</p>
<p>First, each theater should try to set up preferential seats for soldiers:</p>
<p>Theaters in the interior have this method. The so-called preferential seats are not to let them sit in the orchestra, but on the "side seats" on both sides of the theater, or the "balconies" upstairs. In this way, although the theater may suffer some losses, it will certainly be easier to maintain order in terms of business and theater order.</p>
<p>Second, "daytime shows" should be performed on Sundays:</p>
<p>Generally, soldiers will go out on leave on Sundays. It is not harmful to perform for them on Sundays, but the plays performed should not be too perfunctory. The theater bosses should try their best to explain the meaning of entertaining the soldiers to the actors.</p>
<p>Third, the attitude of the theater staff should be polite:</p>
<p>The "tailor's eyes" of the theater staff are absolutely undesirable. I am not saying that they should be obsequious to the soldiers, but that everyone should at least nod to each other when they meet the soldiers, and the attitude should be more peaceful.</p>
<p>Fourth, the troops must strictly control the soldiers and not allow such a small matter to erase our great achievements of eight years of hard work in the eyes of the people of Shanghai. There must be restrictions on the number of people who go out on Sundays, holidays, or every night. They must take turns to go, and there must be officers or squad leaders in charge.</p>
<p>Fifth, the uniforms must be neat, and the insignia, armbands, and belts must not be missing. When you go to the theater, you must go to the designated preferential seats for soldiers. Absolutely do not sit around indiscriminately to disrupt the theater order and be criticized by the society.</p>
<p>In this way, I believe that the order of the theater can be maintained and will slowly improve.</p>
<p>These are my humble opinions, and I write them based on facts, without adding any high-sounding theories. We hope to try it out and offer it to the military authorities and theaters.</p>
<p>Animals</p>
<h3 id="e92">Ants <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>— Wen Quan</p>
<p>Watching ants foraging is quite interesting.</p>
<p>Especially in the scorching summer, it is when these small animals are most busy working. When you are so lazy that you don't even feel like reading, then you might as well get up from your wicker chair and "appreciate" their work for a while. It will really make your spirits soar.</p>
<p>The strength of ants is indeed great. A single ant can pull things that are several times larger than itself; two or three pairs are enough to deal with dead flies. For larger things, they gather many companions, pushing and pulling from the front and back, and carry them into their "cave."</p>
<p>I like to use whole fresh shrimps or dead dragonflies to lure them and watch them come in a vast and orderly formation. Then, a tense situation unfolds. They wriggle and move around the object of interest and communicate with each other rapidly with their antennae. Here, they just work silently, without争夺, without laziness. They have only one goal—to work for the public and for the entire ant colony. In less than a few minutes, carrying this rich "prey," they slowly return in triumph with their concerted efforts.</p>
<p>Even small creatures like ants can thrive and multiply, isn't it entirely because of their ability to live in groups? This shows the value of cooperation and the greatness of collective strength. As humans, who are considered the "spirit of all things," how much can we compare to them? Pursuing selfish interests and engaging in power struggles are human habits. The "sincere unity" and "cooperation" that we proclaim are truly realized in the small animal ant colony. Compared to the working spirit of ants, can you not be ashamed?</p>
<p>Random Thoughts</p>
<h3 id="e93">The Spiritual Food We Need <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>— Shi Xi</p>
<p>Nutrients in food include carbohydrates, fats, proteins, phosphorus, iron, calcium, and various vitamins. These nutrients keep our bodies healthy. Similarly, in the spiritual realm, I also need cultural food rich in nutrients to promote spiritual health.</p>
<p>I am a member of the liberated area yearning for spiritual food. The nutrients I need (perhaps you need them too) include the following:</p>
<p>First, writings that expose the ugly history of traitors and encourage loyalty:</p>
<p>What the people in the liberated area hate most is that the big and small traitors who are still at large. Their crimes are heinous; they assisted the wicked in their evildoing. For the sake of universal justice and national discipline, all sectors should unanimously denounce them. The ugly history of those unscrupulous big and small traitors and their behavior of harming loyal and good people should be nakedly depicted and ruthlessly criticized! The righteous spirit of the universe and the integrity of the nation should be praised, loyalty and goodness should be encouraged, corruption should be punished, and hypocrisy should be strictly dealt with. This will invigorate our spirits.</p>
<p>Second, constructive writings:</p>
<p>Today, after the war, is the beginning of reconstruction. We yearn for the revival of our motherland as if we are longing for timely rain during a severe drought. Theoretical writings and implementation plans, materials of all kinds, that are related to economic construction, transportation restoration, agricultural production increases... all kinds of constructive postwar writings are sufficient to increase my knowledge of construction.</p>
<p>Third, new knowledge about science:</p>
<p>Living in today's "atomic age," with the omnipotence and all-evil potential of science, we are inevitably threatened by some kind of "atomic" survival in the future. If we do not want to be backward in the times, then we should pay more attention to various issues related to the study of science, such as the exploration of "atomic energy," the recognition of new weapons, and the application of healthcare and medical science, etc. This progressive new knowledge of science will allow me and a group of fellow citizens who lack scientific knowledge to constantly absorb and digest these nutrients that enhance spiritual health.</p>
<p>Fourth, scientific methods for human survival and conquering nature:</p>
<p>How to reclaim wasteland, exploit resources, engage in large-scale agricultural production, hunt rare birds and animals, and various scientific methods for conquering nature should be contributed. Encouraging a creative life strengthens my new understanding of the world. I pray for such good articles.</p>
<p>In addition, those regulations that eliminate selfish concepts of contention between people, eliminate war, and create a peaceful and happy life. This type of writing is also much-needed spiritual food.</p>

<p>— Mei Youyun</p>
<p>The most popular songs in the dance halls of Chongqing can recently be heard in the mouths of young people. "Flower-like dreams, dream-like flowers," they walk and dance, humming these charming sentences. From their intoxicated and infatuated state, you can know what influence this song has on these promising young people!</p>
<p>The price of "Shanghai Daily News of the Day" has been standardized from the chaotic prices of 300 and 250 yuan. Each copy is 200 yuan. There are four types: Shen, Xin, Dagong, and Zhengyan. They appear on the bustling streets of Chongqing at three or four o'clock every afternoon.</p>
<p>The business of Sichuan restaurants has been particularly good recently. People always feel some nostalgia for things that are about to be separated from. The "sunset" seems particularly beautiful.</p>
<p>The news of the Political Consultative Conference is too concerning. Every place with posted newspapers is crowded with people reading the news. Their tense faces fully show how much the people are expecting peace.</p>
<p>This year alone, a total of nine banks and silver firms in Chongqing have closed down or been ordered to suspend operations. Society is a melting pot, and dross cannot escape being eliminated.</p>
<p>Another year easily passes, and it is New Year's Eve again. Firecrackers all over the streets welcome the first municipal councilors elected by 300,000 voters. New history! New Year's Day! Everything is moving towards a new path. May the councilors remember what they said to the people during the election, bring out their spirit, and write a new glorious history for the new Chongqing! New Year's Eve, Year 34 in Chongqing</p>

<p>— Zhao Kuang</p>
<p>Recently, the Associated Press sent the following news item from Indianapolis, USA: "Mrs. Schtella, because she was too busy, mistakenly put three one-dollar war savings stamps as ordinary stamps on the upper right corner and put them into the printing machine.</p>
<p>"A clerk in the post office was particularly polite to her. He first helped her to remove the stamps, but he saw that since they had been stamped, they were no longer valid, so he transferred three new ones to her."</p>
<p>The American postal workers are so polite and considerate; their spirit of service is truly admirable!</p>

<p>Yesterday, this newspaper received a donation of 1 million yuan in scholarships from "Mr. Wu and Son." When they personally delivered it, we asked them what their names were. They smiled and refused to reveal them. We asked them again about the motivation for the donation? They also refused to comment, only saying, "Doing good does not require much talk," and then left in a hurry. Looking at their demeanor, kind and respectful, it is evident that they are a sincere and faithful elder.</p>
<p>Regarding the scholarship funds that this newspaper has been praising and assisting with, it has been continuously conducted for the past four or five years, until the "Sino-American Basketball Game" was organized last month. We have always been unable to forget these two thousand four hundred and more adorable and outstanding young people! Recalling the beginning of each fundraising campaign, we always worried about the difficulty of raising funds, especially this time, the budget required is very large, even more difficult than before. After considering and considering, when the leaders are still in the midst of planning, in the next few days, we will report the decided direction to the readers, but in any case, we hope that all sectors will freely donate to complete the studies of more than two thousand young people. For the enthusiasm of "Mr. Wu and Son" in assisting education and benefiting the poor students, the staff of this newspaper respectfully extend their utmost gratitude!</p>

<p>— Jun</p>
<p>The other day on New Year's Eve, this bank discovered a fake 2,000 yuan legal tender bill in the cash delivered by a customer. The printing of the bill was blurred, and the color was more red than the green color of the genuine bill. In addition, the font of the number and the preceding English letters were larger and not neat. If compared to the genuine bill, there are many differences. This fake bill is circulating in the market, but it is not often seen. We hope that all sectors will pay attention. Furthermore, there are still shops in the market that refuse to accept customs gold with numbers on both sides. This statement is actually false, because all banks and businesses can accept and resolve it.</p>

<p>Dear Editor: We just came from the inland. Both of our parents work in government agencies. When our child was in Chongqing, he was entrusted to a daycare center. Now that we have arrived in Shanghai, we are unfamiliar with the place. I don't know if there are daycare centers in Shanghai? We live in Hongkou, and it would be even better if it was nearby. I am very sorry to bother you with these small matters and take up your time. I hope you can take the time to tell us in detail. Thank you very much. Zhi Shanghua bows</p>
<p>(Editor's Reply) For daycare matters, you can inquire at the Young Women's Christian Association at the intersection of Weihaiwei Road and Cangming Road.</p>
<h3 id="e99">Draw Yellow Longitudinal Lines in the Fast Lane <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>To Whom It May Concern: The national vehicle traffic on the right has been implemented on New Year's Day this year. The competent authorities have done everything possible in advance to expand publicity to promote public attention and to modify traffic signs to ensure the safety of driving. Their painstaking efforts were originally intended to ensure the safety of the public. All citizens, of course, should be vigilant at all times, earnestly abide by it, and avoid causing trouble. However, since the implementation, vehicle accidents have been seen quite a few times. Although the reasons are different, drivers are stuck in habits and negligence is inevitable. When the error is discovered, it is too late. I deeply hope that the municipal authorities can draw uniform yellow longitudinal lines in the fast lane (except for those with tram tracks), so that vehicles coming and going can each travel on their own lanes, avoiding the danger of collisions on the road. Although the cost is not light, but for the safety of citizens, I think the wise authorities will definitely adopt or spy on more effective methods to reduce the occurrence of accidents. I can't help but add bridges to the fragrance. I have always admired your newspaper for serving the public. I urge you to publish the original letter so as to urge the authorities to pay attention, then I will be very fortunate. This is above the Shenbao Social Services Office.
