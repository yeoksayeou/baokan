<h3 id="c17">美國務院發言人談稱　對華政策無變更　短期內不擬繼續發表宣言 <a href="#c17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>〔法新聞社華盛頓廿七日電〕國務院發言人頃於本日發表談話稱：關於美國對華政策，國務院短期內不致繼續發表何項宣言。溯自前任駐華大使赫爾利向國務院指責以後，美國已闡明其政策目的。彼時，亦即現任駐華特使馬歇爾上將啓程前夕，國務院曾宣布美國將努力鼓勵中國人民，在國民政府機構之內，自由團結一致。</p>
<p>〔聯合社南京廿八日電〕觀察家有預料東北戰事將愈演愈烈，　成大規模內戰者，　屬坐井觀天，危言　聽之　，其見解與下列三項主要事實，殊難吻合：</p>
<p>（一）美國須待中國政局穩定，始願經進出口銀行以五萬萬美元借款貸予中國。</p>
<p>（二）蔣主席顯欲向小黨派讓步。</p>
<p>（三）中共切望在立憲政體下實施政治民主。</p>
<p>假如美國已表示將以任何數額之借款貸予中國，而不指定中國應先謀國內安定，則美總統特使馬歇爾將軍早可收拾行裝歸國去矣。美國所能影響中國者，唯經濟力量而已，美政府決不致利用軍事力量，對何方有所抑揚，此乃中國熟知，亦爲人皆盡知。個人方面，容有抱此期望者，迅遭輿情反對，不敢復存此念，是以美國表示如果中國恢復安寗，即予協助之諾言，實爲美國勢力所在，中國一日不寗，一日不能與美國或他國進行對外貿易。蔣主席已決定展期召開國民大會，以待國共爭執消除，是爲令人振奮之第二種徵象，蓋主席此舉，已留下繼續談判之餘地，更表示承認國家大勢改觀，而對其他黨派已不容忽視。假定蔣主席不顧中共與民主同盟代表之缺席，依然召開國大，則內戰前途，確趨黯淡矣。第三種因素爲中共切望組織民主選出之政府，則因東北方面有武力支援之政治競爭而情勢稍形曖昧不明，此一問題之癥結，厥在二中全會數週前在渝舉行時，曾聲明反對政協會議數項重要決議，引起延安方面劇烈反感，同時，東北戰爭漸趨激烈，如果有人保證政協會議決議決予實行，尤其是蔣主席若有是項保證，即有廓淸混亂局面之效力，決非其他任何行動所可及。</p>

<h3 id="c33">饑荒　食物　營養 <a href="#c33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>— 兪松筠</p>
<p>目前許多地方都在閙　荒。饑荒的影響，從遠處大處看來，當然也影響着上海的生活。可是上海有許多人不覺得，恬然享受如故，作樂如故。因此英國記者就在倫敦報上嘲笑我們說：「中國　餓，上海跳舞！」講老實話，我們看看上海大小菜館，座上客滿，殘羹剩飯，隨地拋棄，誰都不免會慨歎：在　荒的中國，還有許多人吃得太闊綽！</p>
<p>我並不是說全上海都如此。我們知道，此刻在上海，很有許多人掙扎在　餓綫上，與災區人民相去不遠。但是另一方面毫不愛惜的消耗食物，乃至浪費食物，也是極其明顯的事實。</p>
<p>浪費是不應該的，誰都知道。可是以我在上海管理垃圾的經騐，從垃圾的成份上，看到多少人家，不但殘羹剩飯隨意拋棄，而且也常將可用的菜蔬瓜菓之類，棄於路上。一般貧家婦女兒童，就在這垃圾堆中，爬抓尋覓，覓得食料，帶表果腹。如此有人收拾廢物，倒也算得「物盡其用一了，但若只有丢棄而沒有利用，豈不是「暴殄天物）？</p>
<p>其次再說消耗。我常覺得，一般中等以上人家，總是吃得太多。吃得太多了，消化器官攝取不了，或竟容納不了，結果不但不經濟，而旦也不衛生。古人說：「食毋過飽」，便是說多吃了不好。不過「飽」字沒有一個適當的標準，過去以一果腹」爲「飽」，是從感覺上尋得的意義。感覺所憑多在習慣，而習慣各人不同，有的吃一碗飯便飽了，有的非三碗不果腹。自從營養學說發明以後，我們對於一個人每天應當吃多少食物，方才可以有個科學的算法。我們知道食物對於人體的功用，大別之可分三項：（一）供給能力，（二）構造身體，（三）調節生理。能力是從熱量中發生的，食物則爲熱量的來源。熱量的需要，依國際標準，每一成人每天基本量爲二四〇〇卡（Calorie)輕工作每小時另加七五卡，重工作每小時加七五卡至三〇〇卡。食物中凡含有碳水化物，蛋白質或脂肪的物品，都能供給熱量。脂肪供給熱量最大，次之爲碳水化物與蜜白質。前者每公分於完全燃燒後，能生熱量九·C　卡，後二渚則能生四·〇卡。次就構造身體而論，人體所需者，主要爲蛋白質及無機鹽類，尤以蛋白質爲要。每人每日所需的蛋白質量，隨體重及其所享用的蛋白質之優劣而有差別，若以動物蛋白質爲標準，平均每體重一公斤，需蛋白質一公分，如所享用者爲植物蛋白質，則平均每體重一公斤，需蛋白質一·五公分。再就調節生現來說，我們爲要使身體各部分通力合作，抵抗侵略，必須從食物中攝取營養素如礦質·水·與各種維生素等，以爲調節之用。總之，我們爲求生命的保持與發展，必須要攝取蛋白質·脂肪·碳水化物·若干礦質·水，與各種維生素。飲食的目的，從生理上說來，即是爲獲得此等營養素。</p>
<p>所有此等營養素，各有一定的需要量。我國人民每日所需的營養素量如下表。，</p>
<p>（表一）　我國人民每日所需營養素量</p>
<p>營養素不足，輕則形成「營養不良」，重則便是，饒餓」。我們要求一定標準的營養，便需要一定質量的食物。這是一方面。但若食物吃的多了，超過營養素需要量而供給營養物品。其結果知何？第一，消化器官因爲容不下過多的食物，或者，受不了過大的刺激，會發生病態或變態。第二，消北器官攝取不了過多的營養素，於是剩餘的營養物質，　與廢物同　　　出去了。從衛生的觀點說，此等飲食便是不合理的飲食。從經濟的觀點說，在口腹中多消耗食物，與將食物丢棄於口腹之外，同樣爲一種浪費！</p>
<p>於此，我們對於古人所謂「食毋過飽」的話，可以得到一個新的解釋，便是（一）在恐懼撑壞肚子，（二）怕糟塌營養物質。</p>
<p>營養物質含在於各種食物中，其分量多寡不一。乳類肉類，號稱滋養，其營養價値頗高。但營養物質之取給，並不能專特乳類肉類，同時其他食物如豆類菜類，其營養價値亦高，如果配合適當，大可以代替乳類肉類而有餘。現在我可把常用食物的營養價値列表如下：</p>
<p>（表二）　常用食物營養價値一覽　（表中不塡數字處示未得確數或缺乏此物質）</p>
<p>我們要講營養，不一定要吃大魚大肉，主要的只消把各種營養素配合適當就是了。而這所講的，並不是高深的理論，乃是簡單的事實。</p>
<p>「朱門酒肉臭，路有凍死骨！有飯吃的人，應當想一想挨餓受　的苦况；消耗營養物質過多的人，應當把自身攝取不了的營養物質節省下來，爲挨餓受饑的人留下一點維持生命的資料。此刻災區饑民嗷嗷待哺，還有一般公務員·敎員·學生·和士兵·也都是面有菜色，營養不良，也需要有適當的救濟·善後救濟總署蔣廷黻署長與糧食部徐堪部長曾作如此呼籲。美國農業部長安德森最近宣佈說，他將下令减少美國小麥消費量百分之二十五，以救濟外國的饑饉。杜魯門總統也說，美國人民對於糧食消耗太多，浪費太甚，美國人民每日所暴殄的食糧，可供全世界饑民一日之前，所以他究全贊同强制减少小麥消費量百分之二十五的建議，以此挽救世界饑荒。這眞是仁者之志，仁者之言。我們當然萬分歡迎友邦當局這樣的一個決策·但我們却也不禁爲一部份中國人之享受如故作樂如故而感到慚愧！「食毋過飽」，吃得太多的朋友，應該注意「過飽」對於生理上必然有窒礙，在道德上且是一種墮落！有得吃的人應當想着沒有吃的人；有吃的時候應當想着沒有吃的時候！</p>
<p>最後，我再說一句：吃食須講營養，這道理盡人皆知。營養物質不足，應當設法補足他，但營養物質太多了，也應當設法節省下來，移去救濟災荒。</p>

<h3 id="c34">外長會議商定原則　瓜分義剩餘艦隊　蘇聯讓步加速會議進行 <a href="#c34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>〔聯合社巴黎廿七日電〕四國外長今日在　森堡宮舉行第三次會議，決定聽任義大利保留基本艦隊，（噸位已決定）其餘軍艦，除先分給南斯拉夫及希臘之後，再由美蘇英法四國瓜分。蘇聯原要求分得義大利艦隊三分之一，經討論三小時後，始撤消原議，接受上項規定，惟瓜分辦法之細則尙未決定。今日歷史性之會議爲自來最愉快之一次。四國外長首先討論義大利和的比較簡單之各項問題，如義大利與法蘭西之邊界，義大利將來之防禦工事及其剩餘船隻之處置等項。美國代表聞贊成將義大利船隻分配予曾受墨索里尼政府侵略各國。英外相貝文則堅持於討論魯爾問題時，應准許比荷及盧森堡三國代表參加會議，作爲飽受德國侵略各國之發言人。蘇聯代表則一反以前傳說，對於魯爾問題列入議程一事，並不反對，但不主張准許四强以外代表參加，四國外長代表負責草擬每日議程，今晨會議時曾將較爲麻煩之特利埃斯特及義大利殖民地問題，暫擱一旁，以待調査團報吿書遞到後再說。義大利所允保留之艦隊，最大者大約祇能有巡洋艦四艘，艦隊分配比例一致同意之後，會議即討論法義邊界問題，並未有何決定，當留待將來會議再行討論，但星期一會議不一定提出討論。</p>
<p>〔合衆社巴黎廿七日電〕蘇聯對於義大利艦隊要求獲得三分之一點，今日已予以讓步，而在四强外長會議席上同意接受四分之一以下。蘇聯之妥協讓步態度，加速會議之進行，而使各方希望四國外長對於紐的條款可能獲得協議，以便正式結束對義及其他小軸心國之戰爭。</p>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓廿七日合衆電〕四强於巴黎和會議席上獲得協議之希望，已露光明之象，蓋蘇聯已表示同意，在對義休戰協定之正式修改上，與美國採取同一步驟。傳蘇聯此次表示同意對義休戰協完，乃有某種條件，即蘇聯希望英美法三國願意接受對芬及蘇聯所控制下巴爾幹各國休戰條件。</p>

<h3 id="c61">印度中央立法會議帝聽記 <a href="#c61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>— 周祥克</p>
<p>到了印庭有好幾年了，心中祗想去看看印度的立法機關，不管中央立法會議或省議會，因爲這些都是民意機關，終因校務所覇，株守加城，迄去年冬間，擺脫了中華學校的校務，去遊二千年前的印度阿琴千佛洞後，經蒲浦古立河兩大土邦與蒙元兒王朝的故都阿格拉，而到了印京新德里，於是我決意要去看看印度的巴力門，遂走訪印友迦楞敎授Poof．Ranga。他原來是印度工黨的領袖，爲中央立法會議的議員，爲人誠樸，短小精悍，一生爲農工利益奮鬭，着有印度勞農聯盟及共產黨一書，爲世所欽。我同他見了好多次，我們都同意國家民族自由獨立之後，才談得到國際主義，因爲假使一個國家自己本身未能獨立而趨向國際主義，則無異將自己國家雙手捧送給他人。</p>
<p>爲欲到中央立法會議去旁聽，事先須由議員塡單介紹祖保方可，因而楞迦敎授特地爲我塡了兩張申請書，給我兩天的旁聽機會。申請書須先數日送到中央立法會議的秘書處，然後由秘書處發給旁聽券兩張，可用兩天。</p>
<p>印度的中央立法會議Cenrtal　LehislativeAssembly是印度巴力門的下院，巍峨大厦，直聳雲霄，爲英人在印三大建築之一。大厦週圍的半里許，分兩層，下層有三個大門，六個小門，上層四週走廊，環以圓形石柱，柱高二丈七呎，各柱之間有空隙，至爲莊嚴美觀。這個印度巴力門大厦，奠基於一九二一年，完成於一九二七年，元月十八日，由愛爾文公爵Lord　Tawin主持揭幕典禮，中間整整的費了六年的建築時間，耗費了諾大的金錢，大厦中間的圓頂，高的九丈八呎，可與英國的聖保羅大迦籃上的十丈九呎的圓柱，並駕齊驅。</p>
<p>在這巴力門大厦中，有三個主要的議事廳，、第一個便是中央立法會議，或稱下院；第二個是國務評議會State　Cauncil，稱上院；第三爲土邦王公會議Princes　Canneil。下院內可容四百人，上院可容二百人，王公會議廳祇能容的一百二十人。每一議事廳，都有牠們自已的小花園，水池，以及黨派辦事處，如國民大會黨辦事處，回敎同盟辦事處等。大厦中間爲議會圖書館，藏書甚多，佈置雅潔，這些的議事廳，聯合起來，就呌做巴力門大厦。</p>
<p>中央立法會議每天的開會時間，從上午十一時起至下午一時半止，再自下午二時半起，至五時或六時止。中央立法會議的議廳成半圓形，我們旁聽的人員，都坐在議長前面的樓上，而議長席位，則在議廳中央，其面前放有長　，有五六個人員坐着辦公，這就是議會秘書處的地方。到十一時左右，各議員即陸續的來，我看見國民大會黨的議員們，頭上都戴着白色的甘地帽，身穿着追地的印度服裝，很少穿着西裝的。回敎聯盟的議員們，亦都穿着回敎服裝。議席的編排，差不多有十行六排，環繞着議長席次，而成半圓形，在議長左邊的四行六排，都是國民大會黨的議席，正中兩行六排是回敎聯盟的議席，至在議長右邊的四排六行，則爲政府方面與無黨派的議席。國民大會黨在議會中的領袖是沙拉江特拉鮑斯Sarat　Clran-dra　Bose他過云做過國民大會黨孟加拉省區的主席，爲著名的律師，我們知道那個跑到日本那邊，在新加坡成立印度臨時政府的鮑斯，就是他的弟弟。回盟在會議巾的領袖是由眞納Jinnah自出任，可惜在那時，眞納到加爾各答與孟加拉省長討論糧食問題，而沒有見到他的丰采。鮑斯坐在議廳中左邊第一行第一排的第一張桌子，他今年五十來歲，爲人熱情，說話幽默，人若見到他，總覺得可愛，而沒有一點討厭的地方。我同他碰到了三次，兩次在他家中，一次在議會裏。他是頂希望中國民主團結的一人，與尼赫魯先生熱望中國統一一樣。</p>
<p>議會中的議席的分配，按照規定，共有一百四十五席，其中一百零四席，由人民直接選舉，四十一席由印度總督選任。在這四十一個議席中，二十六個是政府高級官員，包括總督行政會議委員在內，其餘十五個則爲非官吏。此番議會中，國民大會然佔了六十五席，爲最大多數，回敎聯盟則祇有二十四席議長一席由議員們推選。議員任期定爲三年，然總督有權可使議員之任期延長或减短。大會黨與回盟在會外雖有若干不睦之處，但對議會中的法案表決，總站在反對黨方面與國民大會黨聯合，取一致行動，由此可知兄弟圍牆，外禦其侮的古訓，到處可用。</p>
<p>每天議會開會時，照例是口頭質詢，由反對黨提出若干問題，然後由代表政府的議員們遂一答復。實際上，這些問題，先幾日已由秘書處印好，政府方面的凝員，亦早有準備，胸有成竹，故一問一答，彼此口若懸河，滔滔不絕，不過有時兩方有些動火時，議長往往說「下一問題，」則他們立時停止，不復辯論了。我還記得二月二十日的那天，在口頭質詢之前，聽到英倫消息，英內閣將派印度事務部大臣勞倫斯，海軍大臣亞力山大，商務大臣克里浦斯等來印，解決印度政治問題，於是國民大會黨議員阿耶迦爾Ayyangar立發言：我非常高興聽到英閣派員來印，我希望他們處處成功。博得全塲掌聲。議會每次在口頭質詢後，繼之爲討論，他們對於每一法案，爭執頗烈，當議長將提案付表決時，如反對黨議員贊成，則全體都說：阿愛（I）。這個「阿愛」就是表明我同意此案Iagree　With　It），府黨議員則同聲雨「諾」。因而反對黨的議員們，即贊成此案者，由議塲左邊走到右邊的房間裏簽名，政府黨將員們則一齊走到左邊的房間裏簽名，然後雙方回復原來席次，由議長計數，確定此一法案的通過與吾。如此案通過，反對黨獲勝，則政府黨議員亦必報以當聲，毫無不快表情，民主氣度，表現無遺。</p>
<p>每一法案經中央立法會議（或稱下院）通過後，而國務評議會（或稱上院）有權再審議。上院是由有政治經騐人物及高級官員構成，設議員六十人，內三十三人由選舉產生，一一十七人由總督選派，在此二十七人中，官吏不得超過十九人，餘爲非官吏。上院長由總督任命，議員之任期爲五年，但總督有權延長或縮短之。所有法案經上下兩院通過後，總督仍可交下復議，或否決之。由此可知印度目前的立法權力，是分屬於總督與上下院的。中央立法會議，雖非一個眞正的立法機關，因爲眞正的立法機關，當然是英國的國會，不過中央立法會議有權制定印度本土之法律。惟英國會對於印度各種法律規定，中央立法會議却無權加以改變或廢止，除非受到英國會之指示或許可。印度目前雖未獲得完全自由獨立，惟立法機關之種種措施，都很民主。（四月十四日寄自加爾各答）</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕上海市第一次市參議員普選，（總共名額一八一人）昨在繁張紛擾中，展開民主歷史轟轟烈烈之一頁！</p>
<p>淸晨六時，汽笛長鳴，全市國旗飛揚，各區選民，即紛紛開始投票選舉。至九時許，競選高潮，已臻頂峯。錢市長亦於是時，以第一區選民之資格，親赴外灘公園投票。市社會局長吳開先，亦於淸晨八時，親赴所屬靜安寺區投票。投票後，復分別親赴各區及各職業團體選舉塲所，實地　　。</p>
<p>情緒緊張發生紛擾　民主普選，在本市尚　初試，各處不無糾紛發生。其中第五區（泰山區），中法中學投票所，以有包辦選票情事，而發生糾紛。第五區（長寗區），以選民秩序發生紊亂，選舉票萬餘張散失，而吿選舉中止。第十三區（普陀區），因選民　擁齊集檳榔路玉佛寺，致該寺門窗俱爲搗毁，一度緊張，惟調解後已告平息，選舉照常進行。第十九區（楡林區），亦以發生包辦選票情事，發生互毆糾紛，選舉亦吿中止。第廿六區（龍華區），發生警察及保安隊誤會而槍擊事件。後據各方面意見，認爲選民見賄選包辦等舞弊情事，不惜挺身檢舉，馴而至於發生互毆槍擊事件，此實爲競選時良好之現象。</p>
<p>職業團體複選完畢　據非正式估計，全市選民二百萬人，實際參加投票者，的佔十分之六以上。各區投票所票櫃，將於今晨九時，集中各區公所分別開票，由市府派員監票，各區當選參議員之名單，日內當可揭曉。</p>
<p>五職業團體之選舉，昨亦分別在各團體所預定之塲所，分別先後舉行。其中除市敎育會團體之選舉，採直接選舉辦法外；其他商會·工會·農會·及自由職業四團體，則分別由各初選代表，複選參議員。各團體選舉經過情形，堪稱良好，投票及開票手續，均於常日完畢。</p>
<p>調查實情定期再選　民政處長張曉崧昨告記者：據各區報吿之選舉情形而言，一般觀感，應稱良好。其有糾紛而停止選舉之各區，正待調査實際情形判斷後，再定日期，重行選舉。並望各界深切注意選舉無效，當選無效及訴訟各項規定。按市參議員選舉條例第六章規定：（一）有選舉舞弊，涉及選舉人名册之人數違三分之一以上，　法院判決確定者；或辦理選舉違法，經法院判決確定者；其選舉爲無效。（二）死亡，當選人資格不符，經法院判決確定者；當選票數不實，經法院判決確定者；其常選爲無效。（三）選舉無效，應於法院判決後十日內，重行選舉。（四）確認爲選舉舞弊，或當選資格不符；或落選人認爲應當選者，得提起訴訟，但應於選舉結果揭示後七日內爲止。（五）選應先於他種訴訟審判，並以一審終結。</p>
<p>撕碎選票激起公忿　茲將發生糾紛各區之情形　要　報如後：（一）第五區（泰山區）以西藏南路中法學堂內最爲擁擠，下午選民列隊竟排至金陵路轉角。記者等入內時，適遇發生糾紛。緣有監選人金險酒家賬席莫友三，因將選舉票六張撕去，內選楊撫生者二張，選王正廷者二張，選周濂澤者二張，激起選民公忿，當塲將其抓住交値塲巡官送入警局扣押。但開後經區長朱文德前往保釋。不久又有該處辦事員童瑞華，將選民所投競選人楊撫生之票二十餘張扣壓，不投入票箱內，亦經發覺，羣起爭執。後由會塲主特人毛應欽，將一部份選票發還原選人，並將其招待緞帶及徽章，并同其他九張選票，交巡官楊文濤保存，令其作證。以便査究。又該區另一選舉塲喇格納小學，門首亦有人散發選舉票，囑羣衆推選路茶，羣情憤激，但該散發人卒於人業中遁去。</p>

<p>市中社會局長吳開先氏，昨天淸早八時就到他所屬的　安區古拔公寓投票，正値投票塲所，發生小糾紛，吳局長親任排解，當有某靑年問：「你是什麽人」？吳局長微笑的說，大致是可以排解糾紛的人。</p>
<p>吳局長投完了票後，記者問他：「你選的是誰？」他又笑了：「這恐怕不便講吧。不過總不外是相熟的人。」</p>
<p>外灘公園一個五十三歲的程老太太，拿了張選舉票，不知往那裏走好，問她紙上選的什麽人，她說：「我不知道，是那個先生給我寫的。」</p>
<p>記者第一先到黃浦區外灘公園，一看秩序井然，大贊「很好」不已，那短跑了其他奕　地方，愈來態不　樣，大失所望，　來是「人傑」可　「地靈」之故。讀者想必記得：市長是在外灘公園投票的。</p>
<p>「投票」的工作，最主要的是供給交通工具，用汽車運選民至投票塲所，在南市滬四有幾輛藍色善後救濟總署的大卡軍，亦張了大旗出動。</p>
<p>競選人中請客紀錄最高者，據說要推楊某，聽說他在大中國飯店請客十五犬，每天十五桌，請全區區民任意參加，結果帳單開二干幾百萬元，總共化費超出四千萬元。</p>
<p>有個文盲拿了三張選票，要倩人代寫，問他要選誰，他非常慷慨地說，「隨便好了，那個最多就選誰。」某代選人說：「你選某某吧！」他說：「好！好！好！」。</p>
<p>泰山區中法學堂門前有六七個選民在交頭接耳，從長計議。有幾個說：「他答應給我們錢，不想現在却不　我們。我們不要選催」，</p>
<p>仙樂舞塲是新成區投票塲所之一，進口處排滿小桌，專供選民簽名。地方比較寬　，人數雖多，秩序還好。候選人名單中第一名就是陳陶遺先生，有一位老先生在選舉票上端端正正的寫了陳先生的名字，投入票匭，等到記者吿訴他陶遺先生已歸道山的消息時，他不禁憮然若失。</p>
<p>投票民衆大多性急非凡，擠壞門窗不少，尤以普陀區爲甚。老閘區天安堂上午祇開了一扇門，地小人擠，結果竟把大門爽性關上。不想上海破天荒第一次舉行的選舉，竟是關緊了大門幹的！直到一批選完，方再開門一次，投票民衆紛紛折回，怨聲載道。</p>
<p>有人力車夫四川人胡寗生（住王家祠九十八號，二十八歲），身藏選舉票三百張，爲其受託之人奔走，結果他們沒有走到投票匭，倒走進了警察局。</p>
<p>市商會的選舉是在上午九時許開始的。出席代表共二百六十八人，選舉塲所裏佈滿了一條舖白布的長桌，選舉人面對面恬靜地坐着，淸茶一杯，鉛筆一枝，滿像是在開座談會。工商界的名流，都已掃數出席。每次開票結果，由商會理事長王曉穎高揚了嗓子當衆報吿。</p>
<p>杜月笙以久病之軀，昨亦親自出席，坐在主席台靠後面的靠背椅上，和吳局長徐寄廎談得很起勁，第二次投票揭曉，王曉籟高唱杜月笙先生一百八十七票當選後，杜氏即欠身向台下代表頻頻頷首表示謝意。</p>
<p>敎育會團體選舉在格致中學運動房舉行，據說會員一共有四千多位。踏進選舉塲所一看，女敎員佔了絕大多數。社會局專員陳肅，很嚴肅的坐在那裏，四週圍以課桌，每一投票人從進門起經騐證發票寫票而至投票，須經踝桌二十五只。</p>
<p>參加自由職業團體選舉的，有新聞記者，律師，會計師，醫師等，所以對各種選舉辦法的進行，討論特別詳細，發表意見也最多，結果事事都取決於大衆。關於十一位候補參議員次序的　排也是拿抽籤辦法決定的。二十幾位代表，集中在圓明園路三樓中央日報館的一間斗室裏，投票選舉經過，顯得熱烈而緊張。</p>
<p>工會選舉塲所借在寗波同鄕會大禮堂，到塲的有三百多人，有一兩位被選中了的參議員，都喜氣洋溢的跑到台上的麥格風前，向全塲傳播聲聲謝詞。</p>
<p>民政處長張曉崧，大淸早五時卅分就趕到了民政處坐鎭，他說：早飯來不及吃，臨時買了兩副大餅油條，啃嚼果腹。九時左右，各區的電話串連而來，頗有應接不暇之苦。中飯化了四百塊錢吃客飯，下午情形緩和下來，他說：「各綫都無戰事」。</p>

<p>虹橋區競選會塲，設於虹溪小學，據悉競選者，計有陳學文，丁善明，沈一德等三人。昨日平民習藝所所長周祖望率領平民八百四十六名到塲，索取選舉票八百張，結果取得七百張，當入會塲時，由保安警察中隊警士六名會同所中職員隨行。時有當地人民姚國雄者，服西裝，佩槍械，當被區公所人員發覺，勸其解除武器。事被保中隊一警士所悉，遂將人槍一併帶入附近分駐所。旋經人具保釋出。國雄因有失面子，竟開槍七八響，幸無受傷者。社會局嚴專員與所長等出外調査時，詎一般鄕民遷怒於嚴周兩人羣起包圍，飽以老拳，投擲於河內，致受重傷，後送醫院施治。事後龍華分局何分局長深夜親率屬下前往調査詳情，具報總局核辦。</p>

<p>在一個不冷不熱的下午，福州路杏花樓，現出一個熱烈和諧的塲面。錢市畏大鈞。俞部長鴻鈞·以及許多要人，先後在人羣中出現。</p>
<p>嘉賓先後蒞臨，在五位辦事員款接下簽了名，再由迎候貴賓的招待員導至禮堂。禮堂佈置得鮮艷奪目。</p>
<p>三時許，禮堂內已經是人山人海，後至者幾無插足餘地，這時候，突然有人在擴音機發言，請來賓讓開一條路：這時證婚人錢市長·介紹人潘公展·史　賡等滿面春風的快步入塲。</p>
<p>證婚人等就位之後，在羣　的掌聲中，我們的新人陳訓悆光生，穿着禮服，用不快不慢的步伐，穿過紅男綠女，帶着會心的微笑，向來賓點首，人示謝意。</p>
<p>跟着新郞之後的，當然是女嬪相，和新娘。這時候，禮堂上，從熱閙裘靜了下來，每個來賓的頭頸都顯得伸長了數寸。</p>
<p>在美妙的婚禮進行曲聲中，新娘好容易才走到禮台之前。這時候，來賓的頭頸也自左而右，幾千只眼睛一齊注視着新娘。</p>
<p>證婚人錢市長開始說話了，他稱新郞做「訓　兄」，恭祝新郞新娘永結同心，白首偕老。</p>
<p>介紹人潘公展先生川詼諧的口吻致詞，他說。「我是現成的介紹人，因爲訓　兄的婚事，我事先並不知道，我回到重慶之後，才知道他在滬訂婚」。來賓兪部長鴻鈞致詞，他對新郞「爲人的人格」，表示欽佩，他說明他是特別從南京經來參加婚禮的。</p>

<h3 id="c67">糧食部長徐堪談　當前糧政措施　決又量控價開闢糧源 <a href="#c67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>糧食部長徐堪，日前抵滬，對本市糧政正秉承宋院長指示，多方擘畫，訓飭滬特派員辦公處妥爲辦理。近以美總統代表胡佛氏即將蒞華考察，忙於整理各項資料，公務益臻繁冗。記者昨趨糧政特派員辦公處晋謁，叩詢有關常前糧政重要措施，承徐氏於百忙中略吿糧政措施如次：</p>
<p>當前糧食一般情形　徐氏稱：此次戰爭，全世界農業國家，生產均已萎縮，飢饉現象，自屬無可避免。現全世界有形敵人，業已打敗，而無形敵人飢饉疾病之禍患，正方興未艾，尙賴聯合國家共同再盡最大之努力，以渡難關。至於克服飢饉途徑，不外國際互助與自力更生二途，前者聯合國善後救濟總署，已盡最大努力，我國在長期抗戰中，所受之農業損害，及上年受災區域之廣大，當然應獲得較多之糧食供應。上年聯總已允接濟我食米九萬噸，今年一至三月，再允接濟米四萬七千二百餘噸。最近決定四至六月撥米十一萬五千噸，惟此項數字，衡以我國人口面積，及戰時受災情形，仍感不足，現正由行總繼續請求增配中。</p>
<p>對胡佛氏極表歡迎　最近美總統代表胡佛氏即將蒞花，考察飢饉情况，吾人至表歡迎並寄以熱烈之期望。目前友邦少數人士，對我國食糧缺乏情形，尙多隔膜。胡氏此行，必可獲得若干實際資料，以資參證。相信渠返國後，必能爲我國多方呼籲，使獲得更多之救濟糧食。至於自力更生一點，糧食部歷年來之努力，均本此目標進行。當前之設施，一面加强儲運，調劑盈虛；一面呼籲節的，减除浪費。最近川省大批存糧即將下運，贛閩歷年來征存之餘糧，現亦正趕運接濟湘粵等省。槪括言之，對於調劑全國各地食糧，糧部恒時刻注意，毫未懈怠。倘今年收成豐稔，聯總糧食能大量運來，國內糧食供應，前途實無須疑慮。</p>
<p>疏通來源抑平糧價　至於糧價方面，徐氏稱：對於平抑全國各地糧價，本部已有其體辦法，抗戰勝利後，後方各省糧價均極穩定，收復省區，因人口移徙，及糧運困難，不免稍有波動。本部唯一對策，即在以量控價，開關糧源，以期逐漸平穩。以上海情形而論，戰前大部份糧商，多已轉業或停業。收復以後，糧商組織及營運力量，大爲削弱，一致要求政府貸款扶助。嗣經多次考慮，始決定貸款辦法，並組織糧商貸款審核小組會，由本部特派員辦公處，上海市社會局，上海市臨參會，市高會豆米行業公會，中國銀行，各派代表一人，會同審核。凡屬申請貸款之　商，均須經過規定程序辦理，手續至爲嚴密。此項辦法在政府實爲充裕滬市糧源，調劑民食，但在實施之初，容不免有罅漏之處，自當隨時設法防止，並漸次改善，以期完滿達成。本月上半月，滬市糧價尙屬穩定，糧食來源亦較暢旺。近數日來，又呈浮動之象，此雖與來源以及產區價格不無關係，但抬價居奇，只圖私利之份子，仍不免潛伏，治安當局以及有關機關，現正密切注視，並將採取有效推施，俾安定人民生活。本部對於疏暢糧源，以及嚴讓投機，現亦竭力辦理。</p>
<p>全國軍糧籌辦情形　記者最後詢及全國軍糧籌辦情形，徐氏稱：各省軍糧之籌辦，已定有改善辦法，各省現正按照規定，積極辦理。惟有若干地方，因治安交通，以及變災等關係，調運備感困難。本部及後勤機關，現正竭力設法尅服，務使秋收之前，不使缺乏云。</p>

<p>跟着勝利來臨，爲了久慕大名，「三老」遂亦由軍統局上海辦事處「邀往小住」。數月來「閉門靜養」，倒亦着實使他們少去了外界許多邀請的麻煩。　四月三日早晨，三老被請上了十輪吉普卡，喬遷提籃橋忠字監居住了。　法院以忠字監予「三老」住，且有梁鴻志等爲鄰，亦够一番巧思。　在過表，三老亦有稱之爲福一祿壽三星的，如今三星竟光臨監獄，這是監獄之幸呢，還是不幸。</p>
<p>在獄中，林康侯還是西裝畢挺，聞袁兩人則除去長袍，短打裝東。諸「老」並各有妙言：聞蘭亭說：「有天必有我」，他不希望多審，但願趕早宣判。林康侯說「別人在上海幹地下工作，我幹的是地上工作」。袁履登說「林先生說的亦就是我要說的」。</p>

<p>— 本報廿日航訊　台灣特派員暮雲寄</p>
<p>台北是一個明朗的文化的政治的都市，也是常夏的紅花綠葉富有南國情趣的都市，二百餘年前還只是給福建人作爲船塢的械鬥之所，經過日本人的經營，它已從廣漢的曠野蛻變爲純現代化的城市，擁有二十萬人口，四千百二十六甲的土地。在這個新型的都市裹，我們可以嗅到侵略主義者的血汗之氣，也可以看到台灣人被壓榨的蹄痕。</p>
<p>我們不能不承認日本人的刻苦經營，同時却又不能不警惕的我們有多大的把握，可以控制和保持這旣存的元氣。</p>
<p>博物館巡禮</p>
<p>在舊總督府的前面，廠立在台北公園的椰子林裏，有一幢園頂的宮殿式的洋樓，就是博物館。公園的夏的情調，是異緻的，帶有濕熱的暖流，使人忘記了上海還在寒冷的領域裏。博物館是全省六百萬民衆的「醵金」堆成的，當初是紀念兒玉總督和後藤長官的，如今兒王不知何處去，後藤却已成爲待審的階下囚了。</p>
<p>千里駒　僅勝殘骨在博物館的前庭，有兩輛原始式的為車龍頭陳列着：第九號在日本最初（明治五年）橫濱新橋間使用的；第一號「騰雲」是淸朝台灣巡撫劉銘傳向德國買來台灣使用的。館左有一輛毁剩了軀壳的皮質馬車，橫躺在落日黃昏的荒草裏，像是過往日本閑院宮載仁親王同妃智惠子坐過的，還有以前是千里駒，　赫一時的高頭大馬，現在却剩留了一副殘骨，給風風雨雨陷入泥悼裏，人們路過時，不再會記取它，它跟着日本帝國的命運一樣，毀減了。</p>
<p>入塲券台幣五角　又五角台幣的入塲券，走進了大樓。原先給日本的參觀者又指導和說明的女職員，如今因爲不諎國語而蹲在一邊。此次日本受降的文件，接着是南洋館，陳列着南洋土著的生活品和模型，隨後是本省高砂族和滿淸以及日本的治台文件，給我們印象最深的是欽差帮辦台灣防務劉永福的佈吿，和光緒廿四年二月廿八日彰化縣知事的論示：「擊沉日大船賞銀六千兩，取日將官頭一顆賞銀兩百兩」，還有南仁宗天聖四年的在一〇二六年發芽的新高山產紅檜木，實具有深長的歷史意味　日本人將中國的國寳陳列着是具有侮蔑性的，可是他們仍給保留着，還給了我們，這正是六十年來的台灣史。可是當我們看到劉銘傳所撰的「聖代即今多雨露，賢生此處有光輝」勗勉稼生出使海外的聯句，再看一界我們來台的現實時，禁不住惶悚起來！</p>
<p>熱帶之花園</p>
<p>亞熱帶的風光，表現得最明朗的是熱帶之園——植物園。園在市區的西南，公共汽車可以直達，遙遠地望去，就是高聳入雲的椰子林，在靑空的映照下，使人對海島的南國發生無限的愛戀。</p>
<p>椰子林景色可掬　園裹儘是椰子林夾雜着不同科的熱帶樹。椰子，你一定更歡喜亞歷山大椰子那雄偉的背影的，襯着台灣姑娘的頎長的絳紅的服飾，相映成趣。高大的背影下，遍種着不成行列的針似的小笠原露兜樹。澳洲千層皮。遮影生凉的九連吹，以及開黃菓似的花的山棕，蒼老的冲髮似的鳳梨（波羅蜜），龍鍾的榕樹『令人戀的相思樹……</p>
<p>聽松濤聆芭蕉雨　我愛聽松濤，可是更愛聽夜雨芭蕉，這裹正多着芭蕉，雖然它不像台南一樣，溫暖的氣候，限制了她早熟的機會。或許你愛埀釣，綠蔭的池塘邊，連年靑的孩子們也在靜靜地舉着釣竿，戰爭的影子，像掠過園的陽光，難於追尋的了。不，可以追尋的只是通着建功神社的橋，水面上的蓮葉面，橫浮着殘敗破碎的鋼骨，水泥；祗有一隻傾斜了的銅馬，還掙着最後的勇氣，佇立在荒烟野草裏。「研究所林業部」是改變了名稱：「林業試騐所」，有着六十二座高出一萬六千米以上的高山和三萬六千方　的面積底造林計劃，就在這裏胚胎，這裏是森林的發育所，是大自然林木的保姆。</p>
<p>翠綠色遠摩鸚鵡　在台北市的東北面，又十分鐘的時間，可以到中山公園的動物園，這也是個熱帶之園。和植物園一樣，靜悄悄的蹲在基隆河邊。一隻翠綠色紅嘴巴的達摩鸚鵡，吱喳呌着在門口向來客堆着苦笑。用着鐵柵緊閉着小洋房，不成行列的散開着，人們可以回憶到不久以前還有着熱帶特有的小動物，如今大部却空着了，有的只是幾隻猿，猴，覬覦着來客手裏的香蕉，蜜橘，兩隻白鷺，拖着長尾的孔雀，白鷄。僅存的獅子，已失了原有的猛性，吮着鐵柵的巍峨的象，也給高度的物價得不到充分的營養，瘦削得和沒有銅鈴的駱駝一樣。　你，在這裏會惹起濃烈的荒漠之感：稀落的人，頹敗園景，失去了的小東西的空柵！而當我在橱房旁發現從北國來的綿羊，躺在灰堆裏，流着血掙扎着垂死的生命時，增加了我們對於不能妥爲接管者的憎恨！因循，敷衍，不負責，使可憐的失去了自由的動物，也遭受了「池魚」一般的災殃。</p>
<p>胡佛在來華途中　協助杜魯門解除世界糧荒</p>
<h3 id="c81">杜魯門親信幕僚白宮六顧問 <a href="#c81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>— 本報編譯室譯自紐約時報</p>
<p>杜魯門總統忠於朋友的性格，在華盛頓是婦孺皆知的，它所引起的反應是怪複雜的：有些人稱頌它是一種美德，有些人却說它是一個弱點－這種弱點也許到一九四八年時，對於杜魯門先生和民主黨會變成政治上的一個致命傷。話雖如此，杜總統在白宮裏面有着一羣親信的顧問圍繞着他，他們的唯一共通點，似乎就是友誼的結合，即使不是把他們互相結合起來，至少是使他們一致對其領袖懷着不可動搖的忠貞，同時把他個人和他們一羣結合起來。他們這一羣向總統提供意見，指導他的行動，薰陶他的思想。</p>
<p>他們的才幹高低不一。他們先後來到這裏，受公衆的批評，其嚴酷的程度較之羅斯福幕僚中的若干「少壯派」謀士所受到的不過略爲差些而已。杜魯門先生，名不虛傳，對於這輩顧問緊緊地把握住不忍捨棄。</p>
<p>也許人們會覺得奇怪，一位總統在正規的內閣以外，何以還要另外建立一個更親信心腹似的「副內閣」，認爲這樣纔是方便的？答復這問題的原因有三：第一，沒有一位總統自己選擇他的內閣的。塡補內閣中十隻重要的位置須得考慮到許多因素－政策。地理。服從心，甚至適當的身份－斷非個人的好惡所能決定的。第二，大多數的總統在就職以後，就感到寂寞孤獨。他們需要有和善的情投意合的友伴陪着他們。第三，總統日理萬機，不斷發生特殊的問題，需要特殊的處置。　在杜魯門的小圈子內，沒有一個人是以老政治家的資格露臉的，像羅斯福總統幕下的巴羅契那樣。也沒有關係特別密切的心腹，像羅斯福的心腹霍和及霍浦金斯。</p>
<p>「白宮顧問」是一個極確切的名稱。它約定義，視各人的解釋而異。本文所叙述的六位顧問，在筆者心目中是其中頭角崢嶸的份子。至於六位中誰佔優勢，那就難說了。</p>
<p>如果本文寫在一個月以前，法官羅森曼（Samuel　I，Rosenman）的名字一定列入杜魯門先生的顧問名單中，但是韓宜幹的名字或許要被刪除了。如果本文寫在一個月以後，那麽鮑爾斯（Chester　Bowles），飽特（PaulPorter），維雅脫（WilsonWyatt）和克利福特(ClarkClifford）等名字都得要加插進去了。他們都是新來的幕僚。</p>
<p>此外，還有許多杜魯門總統的親信人物，筆者並沒有把他們列入本文以內，原因是他們站在白宮的外圍，而不是居於它的核心，他們是專家，而不是一般政策的設計者。</p>

<p>財政部長文生（Fred　M．Vinson）是一位五十開外，鬚髮濃厚而體格沉重的男子，受過近乎四十年的南方民主政治訓練，在杜魯門總統的親信顧問中佔着優越的地位。可是提到他的政治背景時，我們不應該忽略他是美國最能幹的稅務和財政專家。他在衆議院中服務過十四年，最後担任方法委員會賦稅小組委員會主席。</p>
<p>杜魯門總統竭力重用文生的冷靜的判斷力，但是他所最得力的地方，是在稅務和財政事項方面。使公衆和國會接受白萊頓森林金融協定的，就是文生氏。現在他正在發動同樣的運動，準備參加對英借款的辯論。</p>
<p>像這肅艱難而專門的工作，欲獲得成功，必須要有數學的天才和刻苦的精神，這兩種德性，這位認正而和藹的「法官」，早已著稱於世的。此外，他帶給杜魯門總統以政治認識的敏感，白宮裏面廣闊而友好的關係，健全的常識，和熱烈的私人友誼。華德曼公園大旅社中，他所闢的房間，是杜總統愛好的社交塲所，他常在那裏消磨一個黃昏，和友伴們玩紙牌。</p>
<p>肩負繁劇拘謹嚴肅</p>
<p>史納德　的翰·W·史納德（John　W　Snyder），像敎堂執事那樣拘謹而嚴肅，坐在白宮裏面簡樸的辦公室中，閒散地管理着全國的經濟事項。他所担任的戰時動員復員局局長，是政府中最繁劇的職位之一。仙在每一件從民事到軍事的經濟事情上面，不啻是美總統的一隻「右手」　最近有人攻擊他在他的職務上過於拘謹平凡，不能迎頭趕上變幻而急進的動態。他給予多數人的印象是：在華盛頓的喧囂的雰日杜魯門總統和貝爾納斯的關係，將適得其反，因爲直到最後一分鐘，作爲副總統候選人的杜魯門名字代替了貝爾納斯的名字。杜貝二人自參議院共事以來，彼此始終互相敬愛。貝爾納斯的加入杜魯門內閣，不是因爲他對於外交或國際問題具有深邃的知識，而是因爲他的頭腦靈敏和手腕高强。</p>
<p>貝爾納斯於一九四二年十月從最高法院的舒服的高位上走下來，接管了全國眾事計劃的民事部份，變成了羅斯福總統的名符其實的「副總統」。可是當他去年六月間就任國務卿時，他並非完全缺乏國際問題的知識的。他曾經隨同故總統出席雅爾達會議，他在那裏用速記記錄下來的報吿，對於他的領袖是一部可靠的指南書。</p>
<p>愛倫</p>
<p>幾星期以前，杜魯門總統的一位好友曾經說過：「不要把佐治·愛倫（George　E．Allen）僅僅看做是一個弄臣。他是個諧百出的好好先生，但是他做事也很認眞的。他是個優秀的自由主義者，他是個善良的商人，他也知道解答種種問題。他將得到一個好的位置。你等着瞧吧！</p>
<p>這預言大部分應騐了，他不久被任命爲參議院某委員會中的顯要職位。當他的任命發表時，人們竊竊暗笑，對他表示懷疑，但不久惡意的竊笑變成了善意的嬸笑，愛倫的幽默姿態使他的懷疑者對他投了信任票。愛倫得到這個勝利，他的擁護者是早就料到的。因爲他的雋語風生和興高釆烈的性格，使華府的官塲感到興趣，已經有十多年的歷史了。他不但善於交際，而是富有識別力的。</p>
<p>他所結交的朋友中，都是政府中的顯要人物，如已故羅斯福總統，多數內閣閣員，和參衆兩議院中的重要人物·同時，他在商界據有鞏固的地位。一九四四年他在芝加哥是「杜魯門系人物」。據一般人傳說，去年四月間杜魯門就任總統時，引導杜氏進入白宮之門的，就是愛倫，雖然他對此矢口否認。</p>
<p>愛倫是個足智多謀，排難解紛，助人興趣的人物。總統每次發表的演說，他差不多都參與機密的。他是白宮裏面的一位心腹密使。他最近受委的差使是替杜總統調查戰時機構的着理情形。總統週末出巡時，他是總統遊艇上的必到之客，不等到他到塲，紙牌戲是不會開場的。</p>
<p>新聞秘書判斷銳敏</p>
<p>羅斯</p>
<p>杜總統的新聞秘書羅斯(Charles　G．Ross），恐怕比他任何前任者要受人重視。這個職位向來被視作一種聯絡所，白宮的新聞由此傳達到民間去。羅斯帮助製發新聞。他常跟總統和他的顧問們圍坐在一桌，參加重要的政策討淪。</p>
<p>羅斯在獨立高等學校唸書時，是全班中最聰明的學生，畢業時得到最高的榮譽。杜魯門對他極爲賞職，四十年如一日。杜總統器重他老友的學問淵博，二十年來担任記者和主筆的豐富的經騐，以及他對人的銳敏的判斷力。　羅斯是個高大而略帶駝背的人，臉上常顯露憂　陰沉的表情。他的消瘦的容貌和對杜總統的忠貞不貳的心地，使人聯想到已故的霍浦金斯。</p>
<p>老牌閣員謙讓可風</p>
<p>韓宜幹</p>
<p>郵政總局局長韓宜幹（Robert　E．Hannegan）是白宮中新添的高級顧問。他雖則是一位老牌內閣閣員，而且是米蘇里人，但是他從未被置於杜總統的密友之林。的確，他到現在還沒有。當一九四〇年杜魯門競選參議員時，他們倆曾經反目過，這是一事。他們倆在討論黨政的場合，意見從沒有一致過，這是另一事。在這種場合，表示讓步的，往往是杜魯門總統，韓宜幹的能够在白宮內圈佔一席地，也就爲了這緣故。杜魯門經過了許多波譎雲詭的會議以後，發覺他的多數部下，不管他的功過如何，變成了政治上的負累。從那時起，韓宜幹以民主黨全國委員會主席的資格，參加各種運籌策劃的會議，對於任用新人，常發表很多的意見。韓氏於一九四三年由羅斯福總統任命爲國稅專員。從此嶄驟頭角。翌年一月，民主黨全國委員會就選舉他做該會的主席。（廿四日）</p>
<h3 id="c82">長沙的泥濘 <a href="#c82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>— 本報十八日航訊　特派員高元禮寄</p>
<p>「四戰一火」，曾經使長沙經過幾度滄桑，光復雖已七個月，但還是沒有稍微洗刷掉她的瘡痕，無論你走到那裹，戰火的餘跡，還明顯的存在着　幾條石子的柏油大道，彈痕纍纍，坎坷不平，市政當局曾發動日俘從事修理，但因爲沒有一點工具和材料，祇不過加鋪一此泥土，雨後仍然是泥濘滿街，比不修還要難走些。</p>
<p>垃圾遷移費　增加屋荒嚴重性</p>
<p>市政當局的中心工作，似乎是在開財源的方面着手。幾月來，房捐。筵席捐。屠宰稅，都曾爲市民議論的中心。所以一切整飭市容的工作，都來不及做，垃圾遍地，省衛生處曾統計過長沙的垃圾，佔了市區總面積百分之四十，火坪已不是坪，而是小山，假如你是那塊地皮的業主，而凖備築建房屋時，那你將先支付一筆數逾百萬的垃圾遷移費，僅這一點小問題，使長沙的房屋無法迅速增加，因面房荒益形嚴重化。</p>
<p>溝渠的不通，仗雨後的市區有行路難之苦。敵人佔領長沙一年多，對市政毫不注意，百分之八十的下水道，盡被堵塞。市政當局限於人力和財力，確實沒有辦法，只好將這件重要工作責成人民自己處理，於是各街商戶以好自動集資來修理，近月來動工的確也不少，但缺乏整個的計劃，這裏通了，那裏不通，還是等於不修。</p>
<p>軍民屍體多　埋入火坪垃圾堆</p>
<p>第四次長沙會戰，城裏軍民殉難的不少，尤其是在敵人偵領的期內，人民被敵人殺戮的也很多，這些屍屍體皆掩埋在火坪裏，垃圾堆裏，長沙市各慈善團體特組織一個軍民骸骨收葬委員會，來負責辦理。經過三個月挖掘掩埋，在市區裏已起出三千餘具，但事實上，恐怕還有尙未被發現的，而且有許多地方還有未爆發的炸彈，於是住在市區裏的人，咸存戒心，怕禍起蕭牆，同時夏季來臨，又怕瘟疫流行，過於小心的人家，竟有遷到鄕下去住，以策安全的。</p>
<p>房金十石米　僅租三開間一宅</p>
<p>「長沙居，大不易」，不但環境衛生的威脅，食住二字的壓迫，也使人透不過氣來，長沙的房價雖不及上海以金條計算，但以米來做標準，斗方之室，每月至少食米一石，還得預繳三月或半年，一問三開的普通住宅，每幢兌月須房租十石米，中下級公敎人員叫苦連天，市政府雖設有房租評價委員會，但是不發生一點作用，食糧問題還是沒法解決，從二月底起，二萬七八千元一石的中等米，僅穩定了一個半月，四月十二日，又吿猛漲，每天漲五六千之多，經過三天的漲風，今天（十五日）的米價已是四萬五千元一石，據說是濱湖一帶過境部隊雲集，食用浩繁，而湘南民食缺乏，商人來長搶購的關係，省市當局對這次糧價的暴漲，迄今還沒有宣布處置的辦法。以前成立的民糧公司，曾在濱湖運到幾千石穀米，據說要在長沙舉辦平糶，但恐怕最近不會成爲事實。</p>
<p>蔣主席批准加撥湘農貸糧貸</p>
<p>趙炎午先生由重慶帶回來的喜訊，也壓抑不下糧價。趙氏在渝爲湘災曾向中央及各方作緊急的呼籲，得到熱烈的反應。蔣主席批准加撥　湘省農貸十萬萬元，糧貸五萬萬元，麥粉五萬袋，並由糧食部撥川贛存糧各二十萬石濟湘，這鉅額的金錢和實物，若能於短期內到達，那麽，靑黃不接的時候，也許會好一些。但就現在交通情形看來，川贛四十萬石存糧，決非短期內所能運到。</p>
<p>省政府改組惜別會連日舉行</p>
<p>省政府改組，事前長沙曾不斷的傳說，終於實現。捉去王來，各方面都沒有如何特殊感覺。吳梧生先生主湘八月，其無爲而治的精神，只有老百姓心裏才明白。王東原先生雖以皖人治湘，但王氏曾在湘任軍職多年，深知湘省情形，也許做起來更切實。吳先生已準備移交，各界的惜別會按日在舉行。</p>
<p>前財政廳長胡邁卸職不久，被人控吿貪汚，地方法院檢察處正着手偵察。財政廳和田賦糧食管理處的職員，有二三十人被傳訊，胡氏本人亦被傳訊兩次，地院負責人表示決依法辦理。聞胡氏被控案由，有田糧處長任內員工福利社盈餘分配案，糧食加工剩餘案，及糧食兌撥案，各報並載胡氏已交一千萬元保，隨傳隨到。</p>
<p>新公司成立營物產出口業務</p>
<p>湖南的特產茶葉，桐油，夏布，鞭砲等，向爲外銷重要物資，年來因戰事關係，銷路遲滯，生產銳减，農村經濟因而遭受嚴重打擊。建設廳長李毓堯，社會處長劉修如，工商界名流陳芝田，崔伯鴻等，特發起組織湖南物產貿易協會，負推廣銷路，改進生產的責任。陳崔諸氏並發起組設湖南物產貿易公司，資本十萬萬元，專營湖南物產出口業務，這確是針對湖南的需要，湖南農村也可藉此而復甦。</p>
<p>撥車一千輛僅十份之一可用</p>
<p>但是無論省政府改組也好，發展出口貿易復甦農村也好。問題還是在交通。交通不能迅速暢連，一切還是落空。交通部次長凌鴻勛氏視察粵漢鐵路復路工程，過長對記者說：「沿綫橋樑破壞太重，車輛過度缺乏，便橋完工，雖可通行大火車，但是欲運輸暢達，非俟在國外訂購之車輛運到不可」。公路情形也是車輛缺乏，四方面軍在　接收敵人汽車五千輛，轉交戰時駝輸局代表沈達可，湘省公路局在沈代表處撥到一千輛，但是可用的祇十分之一，其餘的只是一堆廢鐵面已，這如何能增進公路的運輸？</p>
<p>哈金斯主任關懷湘民間疾苦</p>
<p>最近，長沙人懷念的到是哈金斯先生。哈氏原任聯總駐湘辦事處主任，曾到過零陵，祁陽，邵陽，平江，瀏陽等地勘災，對湖南民間疾苦極爲同情，幷曾在聯總力爭增加物次，運湘救濟。據說中央核免在湘徵購軍糧二百萬石一案，哈氏出力最多，因此湖南人對哈民之去職，極爲懷念。圍中，感到强烈的不安，在他不很了然的爭端中，他不幸「吃夾檔」，使他想到重返聖路易斯第一國家銀行內副經理室的幽靜的去處。</p>
<p>一九四五年四月，杜魯門總統就是從這寗靜的去處把他喚了出來，先後接任聯邦借款管理局長和戰時動員復員局長。雖則他遭遇種種困難問題，雖則他想擺脫若干重任的可能性日漸增强，他依然受着杜總統的堅强信任。</p>
<p>說史納德是杜魯總統的傑出的經濟顧問，等於說他是國內一般政策的顧問。即使他不是提供意見的本人，至少他是傳達此種意見的主要的媒介。他本人不是一位經濟學家，而且他在這方面的見解是非常守舊的。十天以前，杜總統接受了他解決鋼鐵爭議的建議，杜總統對他的信任又加深了一層。</p>
<p>外交新手手腕高強</p>
<p>貝爾納斯</p>
<p>杜總統的親信的顧問所提供的意見，大都並不局限於專門的活動範圍以內。國務卿貝爾納斯，尤其是如此的。杜總統器重他的機警的頭腦，幾乎不論在何種局面之下，都可適用的。他對於政府活動的錯綜複雜的情形”知道得恐怕比華盛頓任何人都詳細些一。貝爾納斯在各方面衡呈起來，雖則是外交問題的新手，他在這方面仍不失爲有席顧問，偶爾得到參謀總長李海海軍上將的帮助。</p>

<h3 id="c83">西子源畔　訪馬寅初博士　談經濟發展前途 <a href="#c83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>— 本報廿四日杭州訊　特派員儲裕生寄</p>
<p>凡是關心經濟問題的人，大槪都知道硏究經濟學的馬寅初博士。在抗戰時期，馬先生在大後方講學，勝利後，他由重慶而上海，又匆遽的由上海到杭州來了。馬先生的家鄉是紹興，在杭州他有一幢舒適的洋樓在法院路，他有一個愉快的家庭。雖然已是六十五歲的高年，但豐滿的臉龐與宏亮的聲音，幾使人只看做四十八九的人了。回到杭州來，是爲了看看自己的家，打算在闊別已久的西子湖濱休憩休憩。</p>
<p>杭州人　歡迎馬博士　杭州人是十分熱烈的歡迎着馬先生，差不多每天都有人請他講演。杭州各界並爲他開了一次歡迎會。當記者訪晤於法院路三十四號馬先生的高所時，他正忙於準備演講的時候。</p>
<p>他是位和藹可親的人，由其爽朗輕快的語調中又可看出他是位很忠懇耿直的長者。他和孔祥熙先生是同學，宋子文先生的封翁曾敎過他英文的，論交誼，再好沒有了，但他對於當前的各種措施，根據經濟學的理論，本着春秋責備賢者之義，不客氣的予以批判，在現時代，這種批判實在也自有其必要。</p>
<p>他提出五項新主張　他告訴記者有五項主張：第一是官僚資本必須　剷除。第二是某種制度不大好，而其從業者却往往是好的。他說：「所看到的許多工作人員，大半都是很好的靑年，他們也很用功，有的寫的東西甚至超越大學又上的程度。」所又他主張某種制度取消後，這批善良的靑年應爲之謀取出路，這條出路應該由發國難財，勝利財甚至特務財的人負責，他們應該拿出錢來，舉辦工業，使近許多善良的靑年能够有正常的職業。</p>
<p>國父訓人人有飯吃　第三，政治民主必先經濟民主，因爲一切都建築在經濟上的，如果經濟不民主，政治民主還是空談。關於經濟民主，他敬佩國父：「人人有飯吃」這一句銘言。他說：有飯大家吃，是不對的，因爲這是缺乏生產的意義，弄得坐吃山空。「人人有飯吃」是含有生產的意義的。他主張一定要廢止官僚資本，使人民人人爲經濟主動而努方。第四，召集全國經濟會議，他認爲經濟會議不應該僅在院長部長的範圍內，應該網羅全國工農商領袖，經濟學專家，開誠懇切的商討。</p>
<p>裁員兵應安排出路　第五，他主張經濟問題應有通盤籌劃。外匯的問題，應和財政問題有連繫，因爲如果財政上亂發鈔票，則外匯匯率訂定後還是要有變更的。但是財政問題關係在整軍問題上，如果軍需浩繁，通貨還是無法收縮的。他說：國軍縮編爲五十師，共軍縮編爲十師，這樣的決定是可使財政有辦法的。然而整軍問題關係在工業政策上，因爲調整下來所裁汰的員兵，他們應該有適當的出路，他們的出路應該是工業。但是工業政策還得決定在關稅保護政策上。他說：英美當中國爲市塲，所以不主張有關稅保護政策，而我們工業的基礎太脆弱了，如果不採關稅保護，則這一點點的工業即會摧毁完了的。所以他極端主張關稅保護政策。馬先生談以上問題時都</p>
<p>找出路工農業配合　馬先生談又上問題時都是帶着笑說的，因爲他很相信，中國一定有希望的。</p>
<p>我順他講完後，接着發問他所主張的工業配合農業的問題。他說：「我主張工農並重，所以工業要配合農業。」我說：「有人說工業配合農業，農胞購買力不够。」他又說：「譬如我們辦紡織廠，我們不必去買外國的棉花，如果買外國的，中國棉花就沒有出路了。你所織成布再去賣給農民，農民自然買不起。如果我們購買本國的棉花，農民們有了錢，他可以買你的布了。」所以，他主張中國有的原料，中國工廠應該儘先購用。他又主張國內工廠（輕工業）應獎勵民營，使他有競賽有上進，官與民爭是不對的。</p>
<p>東九省應好好開發　我又問他站在經濟學的立塲上對東北問題的看法。他的回答是：「「東北是工業區，再好沒有了，不應該自己人再爭戰，應該好好的開發。蘇聯拿去了機器，倒還不要緊，如果他要我們地下的寳藏道可不得了啊。」他異常關切正在商量中的中蘇合作開發東北富源的問題。</p>
<p>浙江省謀農業發展　我們正談話間，馬太太出來了，她是一位賢淑端莊的夫人。她正準備陪馬先生講演去。我也搭乘馬先生的小轎車回來。在車中我曾問他：浙江今後的經濟前途，該如何發展？他說：「浙江地下很少寳藏，差不多都在地面上，所以只有謀農業上的發展。浙江的絲茶見極有前途的，不過要好好的改良，好好的努力。將來農業發展了，把農產品可以去換工業品來。」</p>
<p>我們在暢快的晤談中，我曾盛讚馬先生的健康，他吿訴我他的生活是有規律的，每天平上洗一次冷水澡，下午洗一次熱水澡。讀書吃飯都有定時。</p>
<p>他把車子送到我們辦事處的門前。就此分別了。（四月廿四日寄自杭州）</p>

<p>我們－上海音樂界同仁們－發動了組織上海音樂協會，爲的是國結上海音樂界的朋友們，來共同推動今後上海的音樂運動。</p>
<p>以數量，以質量，上海的音樂人材是佔了全國絕大優勢的一個地方。許多的演奏家，作曲家，在這裏得到培養的機會。這裏有管弦樂團，有音樂學校，有一切物質的好條件。世界最優秀的演奏者，如果經過中國，就在上海演奏。這裏是中外文化的交流地帶，是發展中國音樂的溫床，過去如此，將來也是如此。</p>
<p>然而上海音樂家似乎並沒有盡到應有的貢獻，應達到的表現，我們個別的並不是沒有崇高的理想，正確的信念，道是每一個從事音樂家的人在學習的開始便具備了的。什麼是我們的理想，我們的信念呢。簡單的說來，我們願意將我們所學得的技術，音樂　學問，從事於增進人類的幸福，讓生命更充實更豐富，我們相信沒有比音樂更適當的藝術來美化生活，來昇華人類的精神或者靈魂了。如果把範圍更縮小到民族的立塲來說，我們更迫切的要求產生中國新音樂，讓落後的中國音樂急速的進化，在短期間內能在世界音樂的總潮流裏站得住脚。</p>
<p>然而，我們很慚愧，在整個的中國音樂運動上，我們的表現，我們的貢獻是貧弱的，是渺小的，爲什麼呢。把這問題提了出來就立刻得到個答案，就是說，我們沒有把個別的力量團結起來，沒有把所有崇高的理想，好的信念結合成爲一股活力，澎湃的，勇猛的，向着一個大目標前進。我們以往太散漫，太缺少互助，缺少熱力，以致個別的努力都落了空。</p>
<p>各種藝術中，音樂是最着重集體的藝術，樂隊是多數樂器滙合的一個總體，和聲是多數音程和合的一個總體，只有把各種分散的聲音集合起來才能成爲音樂，把多數音樂人材集合起來才能發揮音樂的作用。因此非得有一個機構把上海音樂界團結起來，把散開的力量集中起來不可了。</p>
<p>上海音樂協會，就在這種迫切的要求中產生，我們以熱烈的情緒慶祝它的成立。</p>
<p>我們願意在此略一提及今後工作的方向：首先是文藝理論所爭鄕的提高與普及的問題，我們認爲這只是一個完整物件的兩面，少了任何一面，都要破壞物件的完整，我們將同時做到兼顧兩方面的工作，讓提高與普及平衡地發展。</p>
<p>我們準備推動上海的歌詠運動，讓愛好歌唱者聯合起來，組織些合唱隊，作曲的朋友多寫些大家唱的歌，從歌詠運動中將會漸漸進到中國新歌劇的出現的。</p>
<p>其次，我們將有一些朋友們專門從事民歌硏究與記錄。中國民歌是極端豐富變化。在中國這塊大土地上，它們是人民的聲音，它們代表了人民的靈魂，中國的新音樂將直接的以民歌作基礎而生長而向榮。</p>
<p>在學習方面，我們要創辦音樂圖，讓學習者不致有書本缺乏的苦惱。</p>
<p>一個管弦樂團，將迅速地成立，可以經常的介紹世界名作，允其是國內作曲家的新作。</p>
<p>詳述其他的細節，將超出本文範圍之外了。上海音樂協會成立了，同時更希望全國各地的音樂界同仁們團結起來，響應我們，以全國的力量來推動新中國音樂。</p>
<p>一隻小舟就這樣放進汹湧的大海，我們盼望全世界的朋友們以友好的手援助我們，督促我們，鼓勵我們。</p>

<p>上週本市物價又呈現激烈漲風，米價躍出四萬大關，影響尤巨，當局雖嚴密監督，實際仍黨收效，金價在中行控制下，尙見平定，美鈔則反是，已遠出美滙掛價以上，華洋股及統債則因證交復業傳說，刺激人心，證券商乘機活動，並播放無稽利　流言，以致股票暗市，哄抬上升，公債更奇峯突出，迭創新價，其餘如麵粉油餅紗花糖絲等，無不上漲，長此以往，民生前途，誠不堪設想，茲將上週市况分述槪略如下：</p>
<p>烚赤</p>
<p>買戶觀望不前，加以空方頻起活動，週一至週五在一五六萬至一五九萬之間徘徊，且趨勢帶軟，迨至週六市勢轉秀，乃因他方面之游資歸轉套買，價由一五七萬五昂至一五九萬，中途雖曾退至一五七萬五，惟最後又出一六〇尤關外，站一六〇萬〇五千元。</p>
<p>外幣</p>
<p>中行外滙二〇二〇供給價，始終未更，美鈔則異常堅俏，全週圾低二一四〇，最高二三八〇，因美鈔可作結滙之用，洋商時有收吸，且籌碼有限，再有游資參加活動，於是造成投機性作用，故俏勢頻起，套買踵接。</p>
<p>公債</p>
<p>統一公債雖當局査禁嚴厲，而投機者仍不忘一百二十倍還本之流言，而政府對戰前之國債處理辦法，至今未有明文公佈，民間猜測不一，在投機者掀風作浪中，人心激昂，上週公債暗市丙種週一五千七，徐步挺秀，週二至週四在六于一二百元徘徊，週五由六千元直升至六千九，週六破七千元大關至七千四百元，最高達七千六百元。</p>
<p>股票</p>
<p>華股週初先堅繼疲，晨開以交易隔日交割，市氣活躍，嗣以浮多了結，市勢轉見恍惚而後退，週二市况初開續呈俏利，後以大戶出籠，轉呈疲態，午收抵補頻繁，重吿回升，結果大型股與上日無分軒輊，勤興景福及新光各吿小挫，週三初尙平定，無如四面楚歌，人心虛怯，結果二大型股各挫百元，週四在嚴密取締下，人心悸怯，市况平疲，交易稀少，週五六大戶吸上週趨勢盤檔，蓋因中行控制，納，價格挺秀，因傳證交即將複員，價一致高揚。</p>
<p>外股週初一波三折，終因猶太商之奮力補空，價一致騰升，怡紗及英聯同晋萬五千元關，週二因英聯與怡啤均已達英商多頭公司之拉提目標，散戶居高思危，迭有出籠，市勢止漲回跌，價除怡紗不動外，餘各挫百元左右，週三在當局嚴密監視下未開做，堪外喊價略見疲軟，交易閒散，週四扼於環境，各價再較昨退落一檔，週五五暗中稍有做開，價在買勢中上展，怡紗英聯及會德豐，各軋高五百元，因聞交易所有復業之訊，人心向榮，價一致躍升。</p>
<p>米糧</p>
<p>週初食米市况，到貨較多，交易閒散，價除洋秈升五百元外，餘無變動，麵粉市勢旺盛，砲車兵船均升五百元，雜牌漲風尤勁，孔雀及火車各俏八百至千元，雜糧因出口商動辦，平湖粗豆漲三千元許，其餘亦升千元·食油方面·靑島桶生油高二千元，豆油挺四午元，食糖納胃銳減，價呈盤旋，僅興化白高上四千元，餘均維持原價，週二食米轉跌，較上週末各低一二千元，麵粉市况彌堅，兵船及菊花續升二千元，食油與食糖因供少求繁，亦各秀二三千元，週三食米本街去化初淡後活，市勢轉趨堅定，食糖人心轉堅，中砂績升三千元，週四食糧食油及食糖展開全面漲風，食米以產地售價又高，再升千五百元，麵粉塲外喊價高的千元，黃豆好五百元，生仁升十五百元，生油去化健旺，騰踊四五千元，食精脚地亦形堅硬，週五食米情况混亂，因貨主堅持，市勢猛挺，粳秈米約好二三千元，麵粉以客帮採辦仍力，俏一成光景，雜糧漲勢亦勁，生油供不應求，再高二三千元，糖市人心振奮，在各方競購下，中砂幾升一萬元，週六食米晨開尙平，入後陷於混亂，結果粳秈米各好一成，麵粉塲外喊價更亂，較昨又好約二千元，食油相互輝映，桶生油挺至七〇〇〇〇元收市，豆油好起允多，的一六〇〇〇元。</p>
<p>現紗</p>
<p>在上週間，初因滬埠現紗存底豐厚，客帮現紗實際銷路平常，市勢呈徘徊不前之狀，嗣後以黃金與股票騰踊，環境空氣利於多頭，津粵等帮實際需要發展，市價扶搖直上，尤以風六漲勢爲最勁，全週以星期六之四十二支藍鳳一百七十七萬爲最高，星期一之十支問心六十萬爲最低，若以支數曰“，則十支同心漲十四萬爲最鉅，卅二支　鳳漲十一萬半，二十支雙馬漲十萬，此外各紗漲七八萬。</p>
<p>布市</p>
<p>先頗疲弱，旋隨股市與紗價向榮，結果以灰光斜漲四千元爲多，其餘各牌約升二三千元</p>
<p>花市</p>
<p>民營廠與同業採辦不絕，市勢日趨上漲，米特林送廠已高至九萬二千元，結果各花較前週漲五千至八九千不等。</p>
<p>絲綢</p>
<p>上週人造絲，週初甚平穩，自週三起，一二〇號天橋漲起十萬元，週五又漲十萬元，週末與週一相較，竟漲達廿五萬元之鉅，雜牌與天橋始終距離十萬元左右，七五半光一週內漲起十八萬元，究其高漲之因，厥爲被客帮採辦，兼有業外人搜羅有以致之，廠經上週內頗覺寂靜，週四止無顯然大波，週五起突至漲風，八五分高勻度總計高二十萬元，七八分高勻度計高十萬元，普通貨計高十五萬元，千經計高士萬元，綢貨於週三起，市塲內買興甚濃，類皆投機性質，價遂挺進，美亞被面在週三四兩晶內漲起二十萬元强，週末已呈疲狀，總計一週內大二十萬元，大誠格子　縐週五止大七百元，週末回小一百元，總計上週內漲起六百元弱。</p>

<h3 id="c116">最低工資法　制定的經過和要點 <a href="#c116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>— 田和卿</p>
<p>近來因爲工潮澎湃，各方面對於工資問題，都很注意，其中最低工資法，雖還沒有施行，却早在十年前已經公佈過，今把制定的經過及其要點，擇要介紹。以供參考。</p>
<p>最低工資法，是世界各國在釐定工資時，所採用的一種普通法規，國際勞工局爲使各會員國普遍採用起見，特別於民國十七年五月三十日在日內瓦舉行第十一屆大會時，作爲第一項議事日程提出討論，經全塲一致通過，把最低工資辦法的幾種提議，作成國際公約草案的方式，依照凡爾　和的第十三篇及其他和的類似部份的規定，於民國十七年六月十六日制定公約草案，送請國際勞工組織各會員國批准，成爲正式公約，我國國民政府於民國十九年二月二十八日批准，依照該公約的規定，會員國批准，經國際勞工局秘書長登記之日起，十二個月後發生效力，因此國民政府爲遵守公約的義務，交由立法院依據「規定鍛低工資辦法公約」內所訂定的原則，並參照其他各國的最低工資法，草成共計二十三條條文的最低工資法，於民國二十五年十二月二十三日由國民政府正式公布，但到如今，　沒有命令施行。</p>
<p>最低工資法全文太長，茲將其要點如左：</p>
<p>（一）在釐定工資最感覺到困難的問題，是怎樣可以定出一種公平合理的工資？最低工資的標準如何，這些最基本而又最麻煩的問題，依照最低工資法第三條約規定，是非常明確的。</p>
<p>條文是：「最低工資率，應就當地生活程度，及各該工業工人情况，依左列標準定之。</p>
<p>（一）成年工以維持其本身及足以供給無工作能力親屬二人之必要生活爲準。</p>
<p>（二）童工工資不得低於成年最低工資之半數。</p>
<p>依照上述條文，最低工資率應該就當地生活程度及各該工業工人情况而定，所謂當地生活程度，目前在上海的情形，可以根據市政府每月所發表的工人生活費指數爲準則，至於各該工業工人的情况，通常是指各業工人的技術問題，敎育程度，而尤其不可忽略的是該把工業本身所處的地位，加以考慮，例如　的盛義，生產的多寡，資方力量的强弱，國際的競爭等問題，都應該加以周密的考核，方能作最後的決定，此外的標準，在條文上已經說得非常淸楚，不過有一點要特別提出的，就是最低工資率，是以養活連本人在內三個人的必要生活爲限。</p>
<p>（二）第二個要點是誰來規定這個最低工資率呢？依照該法第七條的規定：</p>
<p>「主管官署對於某種工業工人之全部或一部認爲有規定最低工資之必要時，徵詢該工業勞資雙方之意見後。得提經最低工資委員會議定最低工資率，並呈經上級主管官署核准，實業部備案後公布之』。</p>
<p>最低工資委員會如何組織呢？依照第八條約規定：</p>
<p>「最低工資委員會，置委員九人至十五人，以左列人員組織之，其人選應由主管官署呈報上級主管官署轉報實業部備案』</p>
<p>一，主管官署代表一人或二人</p>
<p>二，關係勞資雙方代表各三人至五人</p>
<p>三，關係勞資雙方各推出無直接利害關係並熱悉該工業情形者一人</p>
<p>四，實業部或省主管官　認爲必要時得派代表一人』</p>
<p>其他如廠方所供給之膳宿，得依最近三個月的平均價値，在工資內併入計算。又最低工資率實行滿十二個月後，方得依法修改等，在該法內都有很詳細的規定，希望主管官署及勢資雙方的合法團體，從速呈請國民政府早日通令全國定期施行，這樣可以免除許多無謂的糾紛，同時可以節省許多寳貴的精力，去從事建國的生產工作。</p>
<p>但援用最低工資法，在自前有二個非常基本而迫切需要解決的問題，第一個是底　的如何規定？第二個是市政府所公佈的生活費指數，其準確性到何種程度？這兩個問題是很値得討論的。</p>

<p>— 石成</p>
<p>我國農產品之出口貨向以絲，茶，桐油等爲大宗，而絲尤爲　，年產的十萬担。而江浙占其半，其餘則爲廣東，四川，山東等地，分銷美英法諸國及南洋羣島，在國外市塲向有良好信譽。</p>
<p>迨抗戰軍興，廠多停閉，雖有遷至滬上開工者，但寥寥無幾，至二十九年與三十年之間，敵偽統制甚厲，即有絲自廠內運至洋行，亦須經過數重關口，且收繭不易，廠商不勝其煩，相繼停　，僅存有二三家。</p>
<p>十二·八太平洋戰事發生，外銷全吿中斷，僅持有細微之本　銷路，絲價慘落，繭價隨之降低，四鄉不靖，鄕人多不願育蠶製種，而柴價甚昻，故多剷伐桑樹，以作燃料、以迄於今，桑樹存者十不得二三。</p>
<p>我國向有蠶種塲之設備，分設杭州，鎭江，滸　關等地，出品頗精良，可與洋種競爭，而現今皆蕩然無存。故今年產種量不豐，幸可吿慰者，麥帥已允撥蠶種三十萬種交我國。</p>
<p>據業中人云，江浙存絲約有七萬餘担，將來海運一通，片刻可盡。現計劃復興該業者爲中國蠶絲公司，爲國家經營，總經理爲葛敬中氏，辦理統銷事務，並設有模範廠一所，地點在蘇州；其所存繭，委託各廠代繅成絲，數量可觀，現設計開廠者甚多，惟最困難之一項厥爲燃斜問題，煤黑市價昻，且不易買到，其代替之物，爲柴油，柴等，而購柴一整天，幾與機器一日所需相等，如此困難情形，絲業前途，殊爲黯淡，惟應以百折不撓之心，努力奮鬥，爲國增光，蠶絲同業其共勉之。</p>
<p>桑樹自育苗以迄　長，非三五年莫成，非細心培養不見功，政府尤應極力提倡並獎勵之。</p>
<p>各地之蠶桑學校，經敵僞推殘殆盡，此後政府應於產絲之地，諸如無錫，嘉興，湖州，海寗，鎭江等地，普設蠶桑學校，敎育蠶桑人材。</p>
<p>民營絲廠資本不足，政府應按照其產絲成績，分數級而輔助之。</p>
<p>今後國外銷路，自意大利日本相繼乞降後，已少勁敵，但據報戰，日本農業仍許存在，且可出口以換取所需品，而蠶絲爲農產品，今後日本難免重振舊業，與我國競爭，現日本尙未能出絲，我國宜急起直追，前途未可限量也。</p>

<p>— 鍾佐祺</p>
<p>小工業之一</p>
<p>在「生產至上」的口號下，大多國內人士的目光都集中在一切的重輕工業上，而忽視了一般的小工業。</p>
<p>其實，小工業是相當重要的，中國受到了八年戰爭的損毁，一切工業的設備以及數十年來慘淡經營的基業完全摧毁殆盡，戰後重輕工業的復興固然需要，但是在國內經濟情形尙未能達到戰前程度的今日，要想重起爐灶，的確是很困難的事；所以，今後小工業的發展，正堪注目而不容忽視，希望大家都能轉移目光來注意一下方興未艾的小工業。</p>
<p>提起小工業，誰都知道有墨水，擦鞋油，牙膏，雪花膏等多種，這是最普遍的小工業，我暫且不提。我所要介紹的是銷路極廣而却不爲人所注意的其他種種，現在來介紹瓶口膠帽的製法。</p>
<p>我們常常看見瓶裝藥水或其他飲料的瓶口上，有一隻像杯子似的東西覆在上面，這就是瓶口膠帽。它的功用是使瓶裏的液體不致滲透而出，並可避免內部液體因漏氣而變質的缺點。</p>
<p>製瓶口膠帽的原料很簡單，只要有下列幾種物質就可以着手製造了：</p>
<p>舊軟片二〇份，乙醚九〇份，酒精一一五份，貝蔴子油一份。</p>
<p>方法先將舊軟片浸入熱水中泡軟，拿出後用刀刮去其上層的藥膜，剪成小片，投入已充分混和的乙醚，酒精，貝蔴子油的混金液中（份量按上）述的比例配合）加以攪動，使軟片完全溶解而成半流動的膠狀體。倘使要着色的話，再加相當的色素，如加氧化苯胺半份，則所製者爲黑色，加鋁粉二份成銀色，加銅粉二份則爲金色。於是將此膠狀體傾入己預備的模型內（其模型甩玻璃做成，狀如玻杯，口徑之大小以瓶塞爲標準，大的口徑最大者爲六〇公厘，最小者爲一五公厘。）使其均勻流至各處，用嘴吹之，乙醚先行蒸發，膠狀體逐漸硬化，趁其尙未乾透之時，取出裝於瓶口上，若使用已完全硬化的膠帽，可在瓶口四周略蘸以酒精或乙醚，用手在四周按捺，待酒精蒸發後，一個密不通風的瓶口膠帽就做成了。不過，製時需注意兩點：第一，乙醚極易蒸發而有麻醉性，不宜用鼻嗅聞，吾則起昏厥；第二，乙醚擴散入空氣後，遇火即行燃燒或引起爆炸，所以製時切忌近火。</p>
<p>上述製法，比較簡易，如工業上大規模的製造，有許多地方應用機械來代替人力，譬如用口來吹乾模型上的藥液，勢不可能，那末應該用電扇來替代。</p>

<p>生產建設，應該和交通建設相聯繫，然後才能收物資運輸圓滑之效，進而達到經濟復員的目襟。</p>
<p>在目前，生產建設的呼聲，甚囂塵上，這自然是一個好現象。然而，就我看來，交通建設的重要，却不亞於生產建設；而在交通建設之中，公路的建設，實在也是一件急不待緩的事。</p>
<p>唯有一方面加緊生產的建設，一方面推行公路的建設，才能使生產下來的物資，圓滑而迅速的交流到各處去，而經濟的復員，也可以積極推進了。</p>

<p>我們現在要提出討論的，是購買力的更變的原因，以美國情形來講（中國的情形也可以參照着而得到一個答案的）許多人都知道一塊錢在第一次世界大戰之後，可以買到的東西比戰前爲少，這就是購買力或者幣制價値的低落，我們應該研究這低落的原因，因爲因此我們可以知道怎樣去展望未來而定奪今後的情形，我們是不是應該添造一所廠房，或者發行公司債以獲得額外的流動資金。如果我們預料在幾年之後，每塊錢的購買力將比目前爲大，那末，我們宜於實行一個短期借款，如果在幾年之後，每塊錢的購買力將較目前爲低，那末，我們借款而緩還是比較合算的。</p>
<p>至於幣制所以低落的最大原因，可以說是由於運貨的增多，當銀行的放款數目增多以後，市面上流通的幣制，也隨着增多起來，於是每一塊錢可以置到的貨品的數量因此減少，而要買一件貨品本來祇要十塊錢的，就要漲到一百塊錢。</p>
<p>當我們在經營一個工商業的時候，有時會感覺流動資金不足而要到銀行裏去借款，銀行是不是肯放款，有幾個決定的條件，那就是第一要看我們所經營的工商業是不是股實可靠的，我們的經營方針怎樣，在銀行界放欽以後，雖則可以獲得放款的利息，然而如果我們所經營的工商業並不股實，那末所放的款項，有不能歸還的危險。第二要看銀行自身所有的現款是不是多，如果他們的現款不多，那末就不能儘量放款，而實行收縮。</p>
<p>有許多銀行，都把放款的限額加以規定，他們規定以存款數目的百分之幾作爲放款的限額（這存款有兩種，一種是活期存款，一種是定期存款，定期存款因爲有年份的規定，更宜於銀行的放款業務，通常銀行的利益就是向放款戶收取的利息和自已付交存戶的利息之間的差額）例如某一分行，收到的存款是三千萬元，如果他們規定以百分之四十作爲放款，那末就可以放出一千二百萬元。</p>
<p>一般商業的主持人，總希望把他們的事業迅速地發展，因此就不斷向銀行借款以補他們自身資本的不足，如果向銀行方面獲得了巨額的借款，他們就會添造廠房增加生產，那時候就要看市面一般情形而定，如果貨物的數量充斥，供過於求，那末就要逐漸步上不景氣的道路，如果貨物的數量很少，求過於供，那末就會漲價，使幣制的價値低落。在最近幾年來的物價，大體亦是幣制的貶値，因爲偽幣的數量發得太多，但物價上落不定，凡是需要多而供應量少的就會漲價，需要少，而供應量多的就不會漲價。所以一個工商業的管理人員，要把握着自已地位，再觀察一般情勢，來決定是不是需要擴展，和大量的製造貨品。</p>
<p>在本國市場之外，同時還需要觀察國際的市塲和外滙的問題，要把幣制的價値和貨品的價値隨時密切注意。關於價目的更動的原因，我們可以舉出下列的幾個基本情形來：</p>
<p>甲，每一塊錢的購買力是隨着下列事實而更動的：</p>
<p>（一）貨價高漲，每塊錢的購買力就減低。</p>
<p>（二）貨價低落，每塊錢的購買力，就增高。</p>
<p>乙，價目的漲落是受着下列情形的影響的：</p>
<p>（一）貨物的供應與需求的問題，供過於求或是求過於供。</p>
<p>（二）幣制流通的數目，和牠們的流通的速度。</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 28th] Chairman Chiang returned to Chongqing by special "Meiling" plane from Chengdu at 9:00 AM on the 28th.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] It has been learned that a grand ceremony commemorating the return to the capital will be held on May 5th, and the first joint memorial week after the return to the capital will be held on May 6th, which will be personally presided over by Chairman Chiang.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chengdu, 28th] After bidding farewell to the people of Sichuan in Chengdu, Chairman Chiang departed from Chengdu at 9:00 AM on the 28th. All officers and students of the Army Military Academy lined up to see him off. Amidst music, Chairman Chiang, accompanied by General Guan Linzheng, the Education Director of the Military Academy, left the Principal's residence and drove to the Fenghuangshan Airport outside the north of the city, taking off at 9:00 AM to return to Chongqing. Chairman Zhang of the Sichuan Provincial Government, Director Deng of the Pacification Headquarters, Chairman Liu of Xikang, Chairman Huang of the Provincial Party Headquarters, Speaker Xiang of the Provincial Assembly, and others all went to the airport to see him off. Although Chairman Chiang's visit to Chengdu lasted only three days, he gave many instructions regarding the educational facilities of the Military Academy and left a very deep impression on Sichuan. Chairman Chiang once said that Sichuan is a base for the War of Resistance and national revival, and he hoped that Sichuan would be built into a model province in the future. He also publicly declared his determination to take responsibility for promoting Sichuan's economic construction, as a foundation for the great cause of national construction. When he met with various military and government leaders, he also encouraged them to cooperate and work together to complete the construction of Sichuan, even saying that he regarded Sichuan as his second hometown and was willing to be a Sichuanese. Chairman Chiang also inquired about the current situation of cultural and journalistic enterprises in the city. Chairman Chiang is in his sixties, with gray hair, but he is in good spirits. He watched a Peking opera performance at the Military Academy late into the night, leaving only at the end of the show.</p>

<h3 id="e2">Preliminary Northeast Peace Agreement Is Currently Being Drafted in Chongqing. Chairman Met with Marshal Ma at His Residence Yesterday. <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 28th] Chongqing News: The Northeast negotiations between the government and the Chinese Communist Party, through Marshal Ma's vigorous mediation, have reached a decisive stage. If the ceasefire order can be issued on the 29th, Zhou Enlai intends to accompany Special Envoy Marshall on a star-produced plane to Nanjing.</p>
<p>[United Press, Peiping, 28th] Government authoritative sources pointed out that the preliminary peace agreement on the Northeast is currently being drafted in Chongqing by General Marshall and representatives of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. They also stated that they still hope the agreement can be signed in Chongqing; otherwise, negotiations will continue in Nanjing. The Chongqing negotiations include the following principles: (1) Immediately cease the conflict in the Northeast; (2) Ceasefire before discussing any political issues; (3) The government should receive sovereignty over the Northeast (the government insists on this point).</p>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 28th] A formal ceasefire proposal is now being considered at Chairman Chiang's residence. If accepted, it could end the civil war. However, the government will therefore lose control of a large part of the Northeast. The Chinese Communist Party has agreed to this peace proposal. The exact conditions are being kept secret by all leaders. The proposal was drafted when Chairman Chiang returned to Chongqing from Chengdu. Chinese sources with inside information said that the Chinese Communist Party is willing to discuss terms more conciliatory than Zhou Enlai's demand for "unconditional ceasefire," but the government still needs to make great sacrifices. Some also say: "The Chinese Communist Party now occupies Changchun and Harbin. If the government wants to recover these cities, it can only do so through war. We believe the Chinese Communist Party will not give them up." Chinese sources reported that this peace proposal has been approved by Special Envoy Marshall, but Marshall's headquarters remains silent on the progress of its ceasefire efforts. The final decision on this proposal must be made by Chairman Chiang himself. This afternoon, Chairman Chiang held secret talks with Marshall at the Shantung (Mountain Cave) residence. The official residence has not indicated what Chairman Chiang's intentions are. A spokesperson for the Democratic League said: "The next 24 hours are extremely important. If a ceasefire agreement is not reached within this time, it may be delayed for a long time before consultations can resume in Nanjing."</p>
<h3 id="e3">Contents of the Secret Agreement Between the Soviet Union and the Northeast Communist Army <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>[United Press, Peiping, 28th] "Yishi Daily" reported: "There is a rumor about a secret agreement signed between the Red Army and the Northeast Communist Army, containing a total of twelve points, including the Soviet Union providing military assistance to the Communist Army, the Communist Army assisting the Soviet Union in removing equipment from Japanese factories, and the Soviet Union's special privileges in Northeast mineral and industrial resources. The newspaper stated that this agreement was signed by ten representatives of the Red Army and Lin Biao, Commander-in-Chief of the Northeast Communist Democratic Allied Army, two months ago at the Benxi Henan Railway Station, 40 miles from Shenyang. People in the National Army believe that this news seems to be accurate, because since then, the development of events in the Northeast has been consistent with the various points mentioned. The contents of the above agreement are said to include the following points: (1) The Chinese Communist Party agrees that the Red Army should extend its stay in the Northeast as much as possible. (2) A local autonomous government should be established in the Northeast. (3) The Red Army will provide military fire and weapons to help the Communist Party. (4) The Red Army agrees that the National Army or the US Army will not land in Dalian or other ports. (5) The Communist Party agrees that the Soviet Union has special privileges in mineral and industrial resources in the Northeast. (6) The Communist Party agrees to turn the China Changchun Railway into the Red Army's "corridor." (7) The Communist Party agrees that the Soviet Union will remove all machinery and equipment from Japanese factories in the Northeast and agrees to assist. (8) The Communist Party agrees that the Red Army has the privilege of "free action" in various parts of the Northeast. (9) The Red Army implements special military training for the Chinese Communist Army. (10) The Red Army is helping the Communist Party organize autonomous governments. (11) The Red Army agrees that the Chinese Communist Army can enter Northern Manchuria from Southern Manchuria. (12) The Red Army agrees that if the Chinese Communist Army is defeated by the National Army in the Northeast, it can withdraw to Soviet territory. People in the National Army here said that Article 11 of the above agreement can explain the reason for the appearance of the Chinese Communist Army in Northern Manchuria, since until January, that area was still the sphere of influence of local Communists directly controlled by the Soviet Communist Party.</p>

<p>[This Newspaper, Peiping, April 28th] North China's telecommunications are still struggling in difficulties. Nie Chuanshu, Director of the Seventh District Telecommunications Administration of the Ministry of Communications, told reporters today that the receiving work of North China's telecommunications has not yet been completed. As of now, the area occupied by the Chahar Province and the Communist Army has not been received in accordance with the ceasefire agreement and has not returned to normal. Even in Shanxi, only a few damaged machines have been received to maintain the most basic wireless communication. Other wired communications have been received by the provincial government. Since the signing of the ceasefire agreement, the Pinghan and Jinpu lines have not suffered major damage again, but it is currently impossible to talk about restoring them to a normal state. The Jinpu Road currently only connects to Cangzhou, and the Pinghan Road telecommunications currently only connect to Shijiazhuang. Before the problem of railway repair is resolved, it is impossible to talk about telecommunications repair. There is no money for communication between Peiping City and Chongqing, Nanjing, and Shanghai, because there is only one machine, and the daily communication time cannot be increased either. Currently, the price fluctuations in North China are still severe, and the monthly income of about 200 million yuan is only one-third of the total income. If this continues for a long time, it is really unimaginable. In the former North China Telecommunications Department, there were more than 4,000 Japanese technicians. After receiving the department, the number has gradually decreased to more than 200, and it is planned to send them back to their country within a considerable period of time.</p>

Now that the conference has been announced to be postponed, delegate registration must be postponed according to law. However, delegates coming to the capital in the future will still be hosted and supplied by the Preparatory Committee. He also said that the government is currently busy returning to the capital, and the National Congress can only be convened after consultation, so the postponement is not a matter of ten days or half a month. Today, the Jiang'an ship arrived in the capital carrying 59 delegates from Hunan, Jiangxi, and Anhui, and they registered this afternoon, so it was crowded again. There were a total of 75 people registered throughout the day, including 25 vocational delegates, 8 selected delegates, and 42 regional delegates.

The delegate registration office originally set up at Xinjiekou will temporarily suspend work from the 29th. After the confirmed meeting date is re-established, a notice will be issued to handle it again. The National Congress Preparatory Committee originally scheduled to handle the auditing procedures for reporters from newspapers and news agencies from April 28th, which has been postponed due to the extension of the meeting date. Those who have applied for registration with written applications from newspapers will be registered by the committee, and they will be notified again when the date of the Congress is determined.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Jinan, 27th] The news of the postponement of the National Congress spread here, and the hope of compatriots who were displaced in various counties to obtain the wish to return to their hometowns as soon as possible through the opportunity of the National Congress obviously encountered another setback.

<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 28th] After arriving in Nanjing, Central Committee member and Director of the Labor Bureau He Zhonghan recently met with reporters from this newspaper. According to him, the tumultuous labor unrest has caused some trouble, which is an inevitable phenomenon after the war. However, the main cause of the so-called labor-capital disputes in our country is management problems, because in addition to economic reasons, there is also a political reason for labor-capital disputes in our country. Today, the demands of the labor side are nothing more than (1) increasing job opportunities, (2) increasing relatively reasonable wages, and (3) general welfare. The demands of the industry side are (1) capital accumulation, (2) ensuring production order, and (3) increasing production efficiency. The distance between the two sides is not difficult to approach, so the way to resolve labor-capital disputes in the future should focus on the following three points: (1) political stability, (2) using timely and appropriate plans to utilize manpower, and (3) stabilizing prices.</p>

<h3 id="e15">Fierce Fighting on the East and West Sides of Siping Street. National Army Surrounds Gongzhuling. Soviet Army Withdraws from Harbin and Qiqihar <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Peiping, 28th] According to relevant sources, in addition to the fierce fighting between the National and Communist armies near Gongzhuling Prefecture, fierce fighting has also occurred in Zhengjiatun (ie, Liaoyuan) west of Siping Street and Hailong east of Siping Street. The National Army is now using Siping Street as a base to expand its left and right wings, forming a large encirclement of Gongzhuling. In order to coordinate the war in the Northeast, the Rehe side has been mobilizing frequently, and a large amount of medical supplies have been concentrated in Zhangjiakou and transported elsewhere. Ye Baishou, Lingyuan, and other places in Rehe have been calm and uneventful.</p>
<p>[United Press, Peiping, 28th] According to news from the "Xinsheng Daily" in Shenyang, because the National Army failed to capture Siping Street, it has adopted a roundabout tactic, and a vanguard team is approaching Gongzhuling, 35 miles south of Changchun. The "World Daily" said: The National Army is expanding westward and eastward from the Siping Street area to strengthen its two wings in order to advance further. At present, the National Army has advanced to Liaoyuan, 40 miles west of Siping Street, and Hailong, 90 miles east of Siping Street. Therefore, the front line has been extended to 130 miles, with Siping Street in the middle.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] Reliable neutral sources said today that in the Battle of Siping Street, which is still going on fiercely, the National Army captured a small number of Soviet soldiers. Three Soviet prisoners of war have recently been handed over by the National Army to the US representative of the Northeast Executive Group for repatriation. It is said that when questioned by the US representative, they admitted to being Soviet citizens, but firmly denied fighting side by side with the Communist Army. Two of them claimed that they were sent by the Red Army authorities in Dalian to purchase food, which was why they were blocked in Siping Street. One of them claimed to be a railway guard. However, the National Army claimed that all three were captured while fighting on the front line.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] It is reported that the National and Communist sides are vying for control of Andong City in southern Northeast China. This situation is developing rapidly. National Army news said that Gao Xibing, the chairman of Andong Province appointed by the government, is in Shenyang waiting to take office, but the Communist Party's "Liberation Daily" said: Gao Zhongming, the Communist Party's "publicly elected" provincial chairman, is already in the Andong Provincial Government. The National Army admitted that the National Army troops have not yet entered Andong.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 28th] It is reported that the Soviet Army in the Northeast has withdrawn from Longjiang (Qiqihar), which shows that the Soviet Army is now fulfilling its promise to completely withdraw from the Northeast within the month. Reports said that since the 14th of this month, the Soviet Army has retreated 400 miles from Shenyang, which is two-thirds of the way back to Siberia.</p>
<p>[United Press, Peiping, 28th] Harbin and Qiqihar continue to control the news today. The Red Army began withdrawing from these two major Northeast cities three days ago. Brief news about the Chinese Communist Party's "Self-Defense Army" taking over has arrived in Peiping. In addition, there is no detailed news. Before the Soviet Army withdrew, the delayed National Army news issued to Harbin said: The Communist Party's Self-Defense Army has announced the magistrates of Qiqihar, the mayor of Harbin, and the officials, and said that they were all elected by public opinion. Well-informed Communist Party sources here said that these "publicly elected" officials have now taken office.</p>

<h3 id="e17">U.S. State Department Spokesman Says China Policy Unchanged, No Plans for Further Statements in Near Future <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>[Washington, Agence France-Presse, 27th] A State Department spokesman stated today that the State Department does not intend to issue any further statements regarding U.S. policy toward China in the near future. Since former Ambassador to China Hurley's accusations to the State Department, the United States has clarified its policy objectives. At that time, on the eve of the departure of current Special Envoy to China General Marshall, the State Department announced that the United States would strive to encourage the Chinese people to freely unite within the framework of the National Government.</p>
<p>[Nanjing, United Press, 28th] Observers who predict that the Northeast war will intensify and escalate into a large-scale civil war are shortsighted and alarmist. Their views are difficult to reconcile with the following three major facts:</p>
<p>(1) The United States will only be willing to lend $500 million to China through the Export-Import Bank after the Chinese political situation stabilizes.</p>
<p>(2) President Chiang clearly intends to make concessions to small parties.</p>
<p>(3) The Chinese Communists (CCP) are eager to implement political democracy under a constitutional system.</p>
<p>If the United States had indicated that it would lend any amount to China without specifying that China should first seek domestic stability, then U.S. Presidential Envoy General Marshall could have packed his bags and returned home long ago. The only power the United States can exert on China is economic, and the U.S. government will certainly not use military force to support or suppress any party. This is well known in China and to everyone. Any individual who harbors such expectations is quickly met with public opposition and dares not entertain such thoughts again. Therefore, the U.S. promise to assist China if it restores peace is where U.S. influence lies. China cannot engage in foreign trade with the United States or other countries until it is at peace. President Chiang has decided to postpone the National Assembly to await the resolution of the disputes between the Kuomintang (KMT) and the CCP. This is the second encouraging sign, as it leaves room for continued negotiations and acknowledges that the national situation has changed, and that other parties cannot be ignored. If President Chiang were to convene the National Assembly regardless of the absence of representatives from the CCP and the Democratic League, the prospects for civil war would indeed be bleak. The third factor is that the CCP is eager to organize a democratically elected government, but the situation is somewhat ambiguous due to the political competition supported by force in the Northeast. The crux of the problem lies in the statement made by the Second Plenary Session of the KMT several weeks ago in Chongqing, which opposed several important resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference (PCC), provoking strong resentment from Yan'an. At the same time, the war in the Northeast has become increasingly fierce. If someone could guarantee that the resolutions of the PCC will be implemented, especially if President Chiang could provide such a guarantee, it would have the effect of clarifying the confused situation, which no other action could achieve.</p>
<h3 id="e18">Repair Work on Shandong Railways Completely Halted, Repeated Consultations Yield No Results, Train Service Between Cangzhou and Botou Also Suspended <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>[Jinan, This Newspaper, 28th] The repair work on the Shandong railways has been completely halted. The replacement of the government and U.S. representatives on the Jinan Executive Headquarters reflects the development of the Shandong situation and marks the entry into a new phase. People here express gratitude to the former U.S. representative Lake and government representative Tu Xuwu for their efforts and express their best wishes, and they have great expectations for the future efforts of the new representatives, Colonel Davis and Colonel Wenze. According to qualified observers, the settlement of peace in Shandong depends on the developments in the next two months, but the key lies in the sincerity of the CCP.</p>
<p>[Jinan, This Newspaper, 27th] The issue of resuming repair work on the Shandong railways has been repeatedly discussed with the CCP, but no results have been achieved. The situation remains stagnant. Recently, the Jiaoji Railway in the area of Ershilifangtian and HamaTun has been severely damaged by the CCP army. People here express regret at this action by the CCP.</p>
<p>[Jinan, Central News Agency, 27th] The Jinan-Qingdao through-transportation service, which will be implemented on May 1st, will use a combination of train and bus: passengers will take a train to ZiheDian, then transfer to a bus to TanJiafang, then take a train from TanJiafang to Fangzi, then take a bus from Fangzi to Gaomi, and then take a train from Gaomi directly to Qingdao, the entire journey taking three days. The local railway bureau has already sent the combined transportation plan to the Executive Headquarters through the Central Region, to provide convenience for traveling passengers.</p>
<p>[Dajin, Central News Agency, 27th] The Tianjin-Pukou Railway from Su County to Botou had been temporarily opened after negotiations mediated by the Seventeenth Executive Headquarters. The government and CCP representatives had signed a temporary agreement to allow for initial operations, but this agreement expired on the 25th. Since the two sides remain far apart in their views, the railway bureau, for the sake of prudence, has announced the suspension of service starting today.</p>
<h3 id="e19">CCP Troops Massing in Gaomi, Seemingly Preparing for War <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>[Nanjing, This Newspaper, 28th] The fact that the Shandong Executive Headquarters has had little effect after months of work is a cause of concern for all parties. The Shandong military and political authorities are implementing unified command and cooperation to maintain government-controlled strongholds and stabilize order. Due to disagreement with the actions of the CCP army and to avoid conscription, there has been a large number of desertions, causing overcrowding in government-controlled cities. Several cities, including Jinan, Dezhou, Liaozhou, Yanzhou, Tai'an, and Zhangdian, have been besieged by the CCP army for months, and the situation is dire with many people starving. The Shandong CCP army, totaling 400,000 men, except for those who have gone to the Northeast from Jiaodong, are all near the railway lines, with the main task of controlling the main force of the Eighth Army of the Nationalist Army on the Jiaoji Railway. Therefore, there have been repeated battles near Gaomi. The CCP army going to the Northeast is constantly transporting weapons back to Shandong. Many believe that the situation in Shandong is unlikely to last.</p>
<p>[Jinan, This Newspaper, 27th] It is reported that the CCP army is massing in Gaomi, seemingly preparing for an attack. The local people are very uneasy. It is also reported that the CCP army in various parts of Shandong is building fortifications, with a clear posture of preparing for war.</p>
<p>[Jinan, Central News Agency, 27th] The CCP army in Jiaodong has launched another force of over 4,000 men to attack the areas defended by the National Army. On the night of the 25th, over 4,000 CCP troops attacked the 3rd Battalion of the 308th Regiment of the 103rd Division and the security team near Zhangling, northwest of Gaomi. Zhangling was also surrounded by the CCP army and shelled, and the power lines were destroyed.</p>
<p>[Shijiazhuang, Central News Agency, 27th] (1) The CCP's Southern Hebei Brigade, with over 2,000 men, 15 light machine guns, and fully equipped rifles, is collecting grain and cotton in villages near the southwest thirty li of Shimen, and forcibly conscripting three young men from each village between the ages of 15 and 25 to receive training in Yin Village, Shanxi. (2) The CCP army in the vicinity of Huojia Village and Tongcun is attempting to prevent the outflow of legal tender (Fabi) and has established exchange offices to exchange border currency for Fabi. On average, 7 Fabi can be exchanged for 1 yuan of Southern Hebei currency, with the exchange rate based on the price set by the Southern Hebei Bank. The CCP army is using merchants to carry Fabi to Shimen to purchase cloth and dyes for military use.</p>

Regarding the construction of the Chinese Navy, he said: In the past, the United Kingdom has assisted the construction of the Chinese Navy, and will definitely continue to do so in the future.

<p>Many places are currently experiencing famine. The impact of famine, from a distance and on a large scale, naturally also affects life in Shanghai. However, many people in Shanghai do not feel it, enjoying themselves as usual, making merry as usual. Therefore, a British journalist ridiculed us in a London newspaper, saying, "China is starving, Shanghai is dancing!" Frankly speaking, when we look at the large and small restaurants in Shanghai, filled with guests, with leftover food and scraps discarded everywhere, everyone cannot help but sigh: in famine-stricken China, there are still many people eating too lavishly!</p>
<p>I am not saying that all of Shanghai is like this. We know that at this moment in Shanghai, there are many people struggling on the brink of starvation, not far from the people in the disaster areas. But on the other hand, the unsparing consumption of food, even the waste of food, is also a very obvious fact.</p>
<p>Waste is not right, everyone knows that. But based on my experience in managing garbage in Shanghai, from the composition of the garbage, I have seen how many families not only discard leftover food and scraps at will, but also often throw away usable vegetables and fruits on the road. Poor women and children often rummage through these garbage heaps, searching for food to fill their bellies. If someone collects the waste, it can be considered "making the best use of everything," but if it is only discarded and not utilized, wouldn't it be "squandering the gifts of nature"?</p>
<p>Secondly, let's talk about consumption. I often feel that middle-class and above families always eat too much. Eating too much means that the digestive organs cannot absorb it, or even cannot accommodate it, resulting in not only uneconomical but also unhygienic results. The ancients said, "Do not eat to excess," meaning that eating too much is not good. However, the word "excess" does not have a proper standard. In the past, "filling the belly" was considered "excess," which was a meaning derived from sensation. Sensation relies mostly on habit, and habits vary from person to person. Some people are full after eating one bowl of rice, while others need three bowls to fill their bellies. Since the invention of nutrition science, we can have a scientific calculation of how much food a person should eat each day. We know that the function of food for the human body can be roughly divided into three categories: (1) providing energy, (2) constructing the body, (3) regulating physiology. Energy is generated from heat, and food is the source of heat. The need for heat, according to international standards, is a basic amount of 2400 calories per adult per day, with an additional 75 calories per hour for light work and 75 to 300 calories per hour for heavy work. Any food containing carbohydrates, protein, or fat can provide heat. Fat provides the most heat, followed by carbohydrates and protein. The former can generate 9. C calories when completely burned per gram, while the latter two can generate 4.0 calories. Secondly, in terms of constructing the body, what the human body needs is mainly protein and inorganic salts, especially protein. The amount of protein needed by each person each day varies with body weight and the quality of the protein they consume. If animal protein is used as the standard, an average of one gram of protein is needed per kilogram of body weight. If plant protein is used, an average of 1.5 grams of protein is needed per kilogram of body weight. Thirdly, in terms of regulating physiology, in order to make all parts of the body work together and resist aggression, we must ingest nutrients such as minerals, water, and various vitamins from food for regulation. In short, in order to maintain and develop life, we must ingest protein, fat, carbohydrates, certain minerals, water, and various vitamins. The purpose of diet, physiologically speaking, is to obtain these nutrients.</p>
<p>All these nutrients have certain requirements. The amount of nutrients needed by the Chinese people each day is shown in the table below. ,</p>
<p>(Table 1) Daily Nutrient Requirements of the Chinese People</p>
<p>Insufficient nutrients can lead to "malnutrition" in mild cases, and "starvation" in severe cases. We need a certain standard of nutrition, which requires a certain amount of food. This is one aspect. But what if we eat too much food, exceeding the nutrient requirements and providing nutrient items? First, digestive organs may develop diseases or mutations because they cannot accommodate too much food or cannot withstand excessive stimulation. Second, digestive organs cannot absorb too much nutrients, so the remaining nutrients will be excreted with waste. From a health point of view, such a diet is an unreasonable diet. From an economic point of view, consuming too much food in the mouth and wasting food outside the mouth is the same kind of waste!</p>
<p>Here, we can get a new explanation for what the ancients called "Do not eat to excess," that is, (1) fearing to burst your stomach, (2) fearing to waste nutrients.</p>
<p>Nutrients are contained in various foods, and the amount varies. Milk and meat are known as nourishing, and their nutritional value is quite high. However, the intake of nutrients cannot be limited to milk and meat. At the same time, other foods such as beans and vegetables also have high nutritional value. If properly combined, they can more than replace milk and meat. Now I can list the nutritional value of commonly used foods as follows:</p>
<p>(Table 2) Overview of the Nutritional Value of Commonly Used Foods (The absence of numbers in the table indicates that accurate numbers have not been obtained or that this substance is lacking)</p>
<p>To talk about nutrition, we do not necessarily have to eat big fish and big meat. The main thing is to properly match various nutrients. And what is said here is not a profound theory, but a simple fact.</p>
<p>"Behind the red doors, meat rots; on the road, there are bones frozen to death!" Those who have food to eat should think about the suffering of those who are hungry and starving; those who consume too many nutrients should save the nutrients that they cannot absorb themselves and leave a little material to maintain the lives of those who are hungry and starving. At this moment, famine victims in the disaster areas are crying out for food, and there are also general civil servants, teachers, students, and soldiers who are all pale and malnourished, and need proper relief. Jiang Tingfu, Director of the General Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, and Xu Kan, Minister of Food, have made such appeals. U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Anderson recently announced that he will order a 25 percent reduction in U.S. wheat consumption to relieve foreign famine. President Truman also said that the American people consume too much food and waste too much. The food wasted by the American people every day can feed the world's famine victims for a day. Therefore, he fully agrees with the recommendation to forcibly reduce wheat consumption by 25 percent in order to save the world from famine. This is truly the will and words of the benevolent. We of course welcome such a decision by friendly countries, but we cannot help but feel ashamed of the enjoyment and merriment of some Chinese people! "Do not eat to excess," friends who eat too much should pay attention to the fact that "overeating" will inevitably cause stagnation in physiology, and is also a kind of depravity in morality! Those who have something to eat should think of those who have nothing to eat; those who have something to eat should think of those who have nothing to eat!</p>
<p>Finally, let me say again: Eating should focus on nutrition, this principle is known to everyone. If nutrients are insufficient, we should try to replenish them, but if there are too many nutrients, we should also try to save them and transfer them to relieve the disaster and famine.</p>

<h3 id="e34">Foreign Ministers' Conference Agrees on Principles - Dividing the Remaining Italian Fleet - Soviet Concession Accelerates Conference <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 27th] The four foreign ministers held their third meeting at the Luxembourg Palace today and decided to allow Italy to retain its basic fleet (the tonnage has been decided). The remaining warships, after being distributed to Yugoslavia and Greece, will be divided by the four countries: the United States, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and France. The Soviet Union originally demanded one-third of the Italian fleet, but after three hours of discussion, it withdrew its original proposal and accepted the above provisions. However, the details of the distribution method have not yet been decided. Today's historic meeting was the most pleasant one yet. The four foreign ministers first discussed the simpler issues of the Italian treaty, such as the border between Italy and France, Italy's future defenses, and the disposal of its remaining ships. The American representative was reported to support the allocation of Italian ships to countries that had been invaded by the Mussolini government. British Foreign Secretary Bevin insisted that representatives from Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg should be allowed to participate in the discussion of the Ruhr issue as spokespersons for the countries that had suffered German aggression. The Soviet representative, contrary to previous rumors, did not oppose including the Ruhr issue on the agenda, but did not advocate allowing representatives from outside the four powers to participate. The four foreign ministers' representatives were responsible for drafting the daily agenda. At this morning's meeting, the more troublesome issues of Trieste and the Italian colonies were temporarily set aside, pending the arrival of the investigative team's report. The largest of the fleet that Italy is allowed to retain can only consist of about four cruisers. After the distribution ratio of the fleet was unanimously agreed, the meeting discussed the Franco-Italian border issue without reaching any decision, which will be discussed at a future meeting. The meeting on Monday may not necessarily address this issue.</p>
<p>[United Press International, Paris, 27th] The Soviet Union has conceded its demand to obtain one-third of the Italian fleet today and has agreed to accept less than one-quarter at the Four Power Foreign Ministers' Conference. The Soviet Union's compromising attitude has accelerated the progress of the meeting, raising hopes that the four foreign ministers may reach an agreement on the terms of the treaty to formally end the war against Italy and other smaller Axis countries.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 27th] Hopes for an agreement at the Paris Peace Conference have emerged, as the Soviet Union has indicated its agreement to take the same steps as the United States in the formal revision of the armistice agreement with Italy. It is reported that the Soviet Union's agreement to complete the Italian armistice is conditional on the United Kingdom, the United States, and France being willing to accept the armistice terms for Finland and the Balkan countries controlled by the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 27th] The Four Power Foreign Ministers' Conference recently discussed France's territorial claims against Italy. Opinions differed, and no agreement was reached, leaving it for discussion at a future meeting. , Two</p>

<p>[Reuters, Paris, 28th] According to a French detective protecting the hotel where the Soviet representatives are staying: The attitude of the Soviet representatives seems quite secretive. We have been here for three days and feel more like suspects than police officers. The Soviet representatives never ask us questions, never ask us to accompany them when they go out, and immediately stop talking when we approach them, as if they are afraid of being overheard.</p>
<h3 id="e36">Obstacles to Italian Peace Treaty Not Yet Removed <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 28th] There are many difficulties in the Italian peace treaty being discussed at the Foreign Ministers' Conference. Of the 31 points for negotiation put forward by Bevin and Byrnes, only four have reportedly been placed on the agenda. The first point is the preamble to the treaty, which points out Italy's actions in the war. The second point is the issue of reparations, which has been decided to be first investigated by a committee of experts to assess Italy's resources. The remaining two points concern Italy's southern border and the port of Trieste, which can be discussed after the Four Power Boundary Survey Team submits its report.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 28th] Hundreds of Allied experts are busy over the weekend drafting the Italian peace treaty. The main points are: (1) the Franco-Italian border issue, (2) issues related to U.S. territories such as Tripolitania, (3) the Italian reparations issue, (4) the disposition of Southern Tyrol bordering Austria, (5) the border issue between Italy and Yugoslavia, including the disposition of the port of Trieste, (6) the future of the Dodecanese Islands in the Aegean Sea, and (7) the determination of Italy's naval strength. The four foreign ministers, who drafted the treaty in London, are believed to have raised these issues, but some of them have caused disputes between the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 27th] The London Evening Standard's Paris special correspondent reported today: Byrnes hopes to complete the discussion of drafting the treaty within ten days at the Paris meeting, but it is doubtful whether this strict deadline can be met. However, Byrnes believes that if such a deadline can be met, there is still a two-week interval for representatives of 21 countries to convene a peace conference in Paris.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Rome, 27th] Regarding the issue of the affiliation of Southern Tyrol, Italy has sent a memorandum to the Paris Four Power Foreign Ministers' Conference, stating that if Italy loses Southern Tyrol, it will reduce its hydropower by 40 percent, lose all manganese ore for special steel, and lead to a shortage of timber in Italy.</p>

<p>[Agence France-Presse, Rome, 27th] It is widely rumored here that Fascist secret organizations have recently been discovered in Italy. Most of the leaders are former Fascist leaders, including former Fascist Party Secretary-General Dara-Tti and former Minister of Foreign Trade Li Gadi.</p>

<p>[United Press, New York, 27th] Soviet Representative Gromyko insisted in the Security Council that there was sufficient evidence for Poland's accusation that the Franco government was threatening world peace and harboring National Socialists and German war criminals, and demanded that UN agencies take immediate action. It is heard that his position has not changed. Mexican Provisional Representative Colina is trying to break the deadlock and plans to propose a solution to enable everyone to act unanimously. Colina has been contacting representatives of various countries based on the proposal of Australian Representative Hodgson. Apart from the Soviet representative, other representatives have more or less agreed.</p>
<p>[United Press, New York, 27th] Australian Representative to the United Nations Security Council Hodgson announced today that he has resigned from his position as representative due to his wife's illness (his wife currently lives in Paris). His successor will be Hasluck, and there will be no change in policy. Hodgson is scheduled to leave for Paris on the 28th.</p>
<p>[United Press International, Madrid, 27th] Reliable sources here said today that the Franco government will hold a national referendum on July 18 to ask the people whether they approve of Franco remaining as head of state. July 18 is the anniversary of the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War. Franco's supporters are all withdrawing. Franco accepted the referendum because the authoritarianist Bèza in Argentina was recently able to be elected president.</p>
<h3 id="e40">Argentina Loans to Spain <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>[United Press, Argentine Capital, 28th] Argentine Foreign Ministry officials stated today that the country will sign an agreement with Spain on Tuesday to loan 30 million pesos (US$7.5 million) to Spain for the purchase of food in Argentina. This agreement has no international political significance. However, given that the Franco government may be considering moving to the United Nations Security Council, diplomatic circles here expressed surprise that Argentina would negotiate a loan with it.</p>

<p>[United Press, Washington, 27th] UNRRA Director LaGuardia announced today that UNRRA is continuing to ship 2,268,000 doses of cholera vaccine to China. This batch of vaccines is sufficient to protect 200,000 lives. For the sake of caution, UNRRA has decided that the first batch of 2,280,000 doses of vaccine will be transported by a chartered passenger plane from San Francisco on Sunday. UNRRA will do its best to prevent the spread of cholera in the Guangzhou area, using the same methods as it used last year to assist Chongqing in preventing a serious epidemic.</p>
<h3 id="e42">British Labour Party Annual Conference: Prime Minister Delivers Anti-Communist Remarks, Saying Their Seizure of Power is Unscrupulous, Obstructing the Future of Democracy <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 27th] British Prime Minister Attlee addressed the Labour Party conference today, stating that the Communist Party is hypocritical towards democracy and is in fact the least democratic. Furthermore, in terms of the methods they adopt to seize power, they often only care about the ends and are unscrupulous, disregarding the standards of behavior that sustain civilized social life. I firmly believe that the Labour Party conference will reaffirm its opposition to those who do not endorse the party platform but wish to join the party.</p>
<p>Regarding British foreign policy, its main principle is to do everything possible to uphold and strengthen the authority of the United Nations. Foreign Secretary Bevin has expressed his constructive ideas on this matter. Every time he delivers a speech on diplomacy, you will find that he never forgets the economic background of political problems. We are currently working with others to solve many difficult problems inherited from the past, especially the problems of Palestine and India. We have led the world to accept the international trusteeship system, which is to place former mandated territories under international trusteeship. We hope that both the Netherlands and Indonesia can meet each other with sincerity and find a compromise solution. In short, in any part of the world that concerns us, we are doing our best to promote the freedom and democracy of others. This fact cannot be denied by any fair observer.</p>
<p>The Spanish Question: [Agence France-Presse, London, 27th] After delivering a speech at the Labour Party conference, the British Prime Minister answered various questions, saying, "I hope the Spanish people will quickly rise up and overthrow the Franco regime." When asked why British ambassadors to various countries are predominantly Conservative, the Prime Minister replied that the selection of British ambassadors is not based on personal political views. We employ the most outstanding and sensitive talents.</p>

<p>[United Press, Washington, 27th] The National Geographic Society announced today that scientists aboard a specially equipped B-29 Superfortress will conduct an unprecedented study of atomic energy as manifested in cosmic ray radiation next month. They will fly four times at altitudes of 5,000 to 35,000 feet, starting from the northern United States and ending at the magnetic equator, measuring the intensity of cosmic rays. Scientists intend to explore the exact intensity of neutrons, which they believe are the first particles split after light rays enter the Earth's atmosphere. The lifespan of these neutrons is only a few millionths of a second.</p>

<p>[United Press, Washington, 27th] Government authorities announced tonight that the United States' large-scale overseas defense plan is closely related to future international security measures. It was also learned that the United States began negotiations several months ago to obtain permanent military and aviation bases in Iceland. Although these negotiations have been temporarily suspended, they will resume after the Icelandic elections on June 30th. This matter is related to the overseas defense plan announced approximately today by the authorities. The authorities are unwilling to disclose the details of the development of this defense, only revealing the following points:</p>
<p>(1) The base area will extend from Iceland to Manus Island in Australian New Guinea in the Southwest Pacific.</p>
<p>(2) Other bases will be established on the islands of Japan, which are administered by the United States.</p>
<p>(3) The bases on the islands leased to the United States by the United Kingdom for a term of 99 years will be retained.</p>
<p>(4) The bases built within Latin America will be maintained separately by the countries of the Americas.</p>
<p>(5) The joint defense system and its joint defense staff established with Canada during the war will be maintained.</p>
<p>It is said that if Iceland joins the United Nations, the various facilities obtained by the United States there can be used by international organizations.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 28th] The US State Department issued an overseas defense plan and mentioned the proposal to Iceland in October last year to establish a base. Icelandic Prime Minister Thor Thors, who is engaged in political campaigns because of the upcoming election at the end of June, made a broadcast speech to the nation, declaring that the Icelandic government cannot grant the United States the right to establish an air base, which caused the US plan to suffer setbacks. It is heard that after the US government made the proposal last year, although it did not ask Iceland for a solution, it cannot be regarded as over. Thor Thors' frank statement this time did not change the US attitude, and it is expected that the matter will be reconsidered after the Icelandic election.</p>
<p>[US Information Service, Washington, 27th] The State Department issued a statement today, detailing the US proposal to Iceland regarding the joint use of Icelandic military equipment after the end of the war. The State Department stated that so far, the two sides have not held any negotiations.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 27th] The State Department issued a communiqué stating that US military personnel remaining in Iceland are being withdrawn.</p>

<p>[United Press, Los Angeles, 28th] The US Army officially unveiled the secret of the B-35 "Flying Wing" bomber today. The appearance of this aircraft makes the B-29 pale in comparison. Its range can exceed 10,000 miles, exceeding the world record of 8,198 miles set by the B-29 by about a quarter. The B-35 is designed and manufactured by Northrop Corporation. The shape of the aircraft is similar to the boomerang used by Australian Aborigines. The wings are slightly curved backwards. The crew, engine fuel, and weapons are all inside the wings. The total length of the two wings is 172 feet, and the center width is 37.5 feet. The normal load is 162,000 pounds. The B-29 has a wingspan of 141 feet, a fuselage length of 99 feet, and a load capacity of 140,000 pounds.</p>

<p>[Reuters, London, 28th] The British Channel Tunnel Company will hold an annual meeting in June to discuss the construction of a railway and automobile tunnel under the English Channel. This plan was proposed during the Napoleonic era and again in 1924, but was rejected by the Imperial Defence Committee for military reasons. In 1929, Parliament established a special committee to study the plan. The cost of constructing a 36-mile-long tunnel was estimated at £30 million at the time, and the cost of vehicles and other equipment was £58 million. It was estimated that the journey from London to Paris would only take two hours and forty-five minutes. Although the committee considered the construction cost too high, it was economically beneficial to the United Kingdom. In 1930, the government issued a document on the matter, but ultimately rejected it. During World War II, it was once planned to start construction for defense reasons, but the government also expressed opposition at the time. Now that peace has been restored, there is even less hope of realization, but the people of the Channel Tunnel Company will continue to work hard to promote its realization.</p>

<p>[United Press, New York, 28th] According to statistical experts, the number of babies born in the United States this year may exceed three million, a new record. Although it is only April, it is not possible to make an accurate estimate, but the birth rate is closely related to the marriage rate. Since the victory in Europe, the marriage rate in the United States has increased sharply compared to before. The number of marriages in January and February of this year increased by 67% compared to the same period last year.</p>

<p>[Reuters, New Delhi, 28th] The British Cabinet Delegation has been negotiating in India for a month with slow progress. Only yesterday, it invited representatives from the Congress Party and the Muslim League to convene a round table conference to resolve the different views of all parties regarding Indian independence. If all parties can accept participation in this conference, the conference period will last for a week or ten days to seek an agreement in order to facilitate the formation of a provisional people's government. The British Cabinet representatives previously held individual talks with Indian party leaders to listen to their opinions. Now they must be fully aware of everything, and in order to seek their cooperation, they initiated the convening of a round table conference.</p>

<h3 id="e59">US State Department to Propose: International Control of Atomic Energy: Reduce World Anxiety: Exclusively for Industrial Production Purposes <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters, Manchester, 28th] British atomic expert Professor Braggart claimed that the US State Department will release a report on international control of atomic energy within days, suggesting that an International Atomic Energy Development Agency be formed by scientists, technicians, and engineers from various countries, and that the agency be responsible by the United Nations for most of the development of atomic energy. If the extraction of elements, the sale or transfer of atomic sources to public or private institutions for industrial production, and the supervision of the proper application of these raw materials are all presided over by the agency. The professor said that scientists invented this terrifying thing, and the world is panicked. Therefore, scientists should still find ways to reduce the world's anxiety in order to establish peace.</p>
<p>British Atomic Industry Under State Control</p>
<p>"Reuters, London, 28th] It was officially announced here yesterday that the British government will implement a bill next week stipulating that all industries in the UK that develop atomic energy will be placed under state control. The government is the general agency for controlling atomic energy and will establish research institutes in various places. In order to ensure that the achievements of atomic energy research can keep pace with other countries, a research institute has been established near Oxford.</p>
<p>Soviet Union Catching Up in Atomic Energy Research</p>
<p>[United Press, New York, 27th] The Soviet Academy of Sciences atomic energy plan book by Vavilov was recently released by the Soviet Embassy in the United States, focusing on the peaceful use of atomic energy. Although Van mentioned rocket artillery, he did not mention atomic warfare. Marshal Stalin ordered Soviet scientists to catch up quickly and exceed the scientific achievements of other countries in the near future. What Van said is a summary of how to implement this order. It is said that physics and chemistry occupy a particularly important position. Physicists cooperate with other experts to analyze all special phenomena in physics and try to release atomic nuclear energy, which has great hope for mankind. The future application of this energy will undoubtedly provide a new solution to problems such as power transportation. Van stressed that astronomers will have a position in atomic nuclear energy and its future development, which is not mentioned in the American plan. Astronomers can provide various ideas in terms of conducting work. The Soviet plan focuses on determining the actual decomposition substances obtained from the atomic nucleus, which refers to many chemical elements formed in the atomic furnace. At least 30 kinds are known in the American atomic work.</p>

<h3 id="e61">Record of Imperial Hearing at the Indian Central Legislative Assembly <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>— Zhou Xiangke</p>
<p>I have been in India for several years, and I have always wanted to see India's legislative bodies, whether the Central Legislative Assembly or the provincial councils, because these are institutions of public opinion. However, I was preoccupied with school affairs and stuck in Calcutta. It wasn't until last winter that I was free from the duties of the Chinese School and traveled to the Ajanta Caves of India, dating back two thousand years. After passing through the two large native states of Poona and Gwalior and Agra, the former capital of the Mongol Yuan Dynasty, I arrived in New Delhi, the Indian capital. There, I decided to visit the Indian Parliament. I visited my Indian friend, Professor N. G. Ranga. He was originally the leader of the Indian Labour Party and a member of the Central Legislative Assembly. He was honest and unassuming, short and stocky, and dedicated his life to fighting for the interests of farmers and workers. He is the author of "Indian Labour and Peasant Alliance and the Communist Party," which is admired by the world. I met him several times, and we both agreed that internationalism could only be discussed after national and ethnic freedom and independence. If a country itself is not independent and leans towards internationalism, it is tantamount to offering its own country to others with both hands.</p>
<p>To attend the Central Legislative Assembly, one must first have a member fill out a form to introduce and guarantee. Therefore, Professor Ranga specially filled out two application forms for me, giving me the opportunity to attend for two days. The application form must be submitted to the secretariat of the Central Legislative Assembly several days in advance, and then the secretariat will issue two admission tickets, which can be used for two days.</p>
<p>The Indian Central Legislative Assembly, the lower house of the Indian Parliament, is a magnificent building that soars into the clouds and is one of the three major British buildings in India. The perimeter of the building, about half a mile, is divided into two levels. The lower level has three large doors and six small doors, and the upper level has a corridor surrounded by circular stone pillars, each pillar being 27 feet high, with gaps between the pillars, making it extremely solemn and beautiful. The foundation of this Indian Parliament building was laid in 1921 and completed in 1927. On January 18, the opening ceremony was presided over by Lord Irwin. The construction took a full six years and cost a great deal of money. The dome in the middle of the building is 98 feet high, comparable to the 109-foot column of St. Paul's Cathedral in England.</p>
<p>Inside the Parliament Building, there are three main chambers. The first is the Central Legislative Assembly, or the Lower House; the second is the Council of States, or the Upper House; and the third is the Chamber of Princes. The Lower House can accommodate 400 people, the Upper House can accommodate 200 people, and the Chamber of Princes can only accommodate 120 people. Each chamber has its own small garden, pond, and party offices, such as the Indian National Congress office and the Muslim League office. These chambers, combined, are called the Parliament Building.</p>
<p>The Central Legislative Assembly meets every day from 11:00 AM to 1:30 PM, and then from 2:30 PM to 5:00 PM or 6:00 PM. The assembly hall of the Central Legislative Assembly is semicircular. We, the audience, sit on the floor in front of the speaker, and the speaker's seat is in the center of the hall, with a long desk in front of him, where five or six staff members sit and work. This is the location of the parliament secretariat. Around 11:00 AM, the members arrive one after another. I saw that the members of the Indian National Congress wore white Gandhi caps on their heads and Indian clothes that reached the ground, rarely wearing Western suits. The members of the Muslim League also wore Muslim clothing. The seating arrangement has approximately ten rows and six columns, surrounding the speaker's seat in a semicircle. The four rows and six columns to the left of the speaker are the seats of the Indian National Congress, the two rows and six columns in the center are the seats of the Muslim League, and the four rows and six columns to the right of the speaker are the seats of the government and non-affiliated members. The leader of the Indian National Congress in the assembly is Sarat Chandra Bose, who once served as the chairman of the Bengal Provincial Committee of the Indian National Congress and is a famous lawyer. We know that the Bose who ran to Japan and established the Provisional Government of India in Singapore is his younger brother. The leader of the Muslim League in the assembly was supposed to be Jinnah, but unfortunately, at that time, Jinnah went to Calcutta to discuss the food problem with the Governor of Bengal, and I did not see his demeanor. Bose sits at the first table in the first row on the left side of the assembly hall. He is in his fifties, passionate, and speaks with humor. Anyone who sees him finds him adorable and not at all annoying. I met him three times, twice at his home and once in the assembly. He sincerely hopes for China's democracy and unity, just like Mr. Nehru's eager desire for China's unity.</p>
<p>The distribution of seats in the assembly, according to regulations, totals 145 seats, of which 104 seats are directly elected by the people, and 41 seats are appointed by the Governor-General of India. Of these 41 seats, 26 are senior government officials, including members of the Governor-General's Executive Council, and the remaining 15 are non-officials. In this session of the assembly, the Indian National Congress occupies 65 seats, the largest majority, while the Muslim League has only 24 seats. The speaker is elected by the members. The term of office for members is set at three years, but the Governor-General has the power to extend or shorten the term of office for members. Although there are some discords between the Congress Party and the Muslim League outside the assembly, they always stand on the side of the opposition and unite with the Indian National Congress in voting on bills in the assembly, taking unified action. From this, we can see that the ancient saying of "brothers quarreling within the walls, but united against external aggression" can be used everywhere.</p>
<p>When the assembly meets every day, the routine is oral inquiries, where the opposition party raises some questions, and then the members representing the government answer them one by one. In fact, these questions have been printed by the secretariat a few days in advance, and the government members are also prepared and have a clear understanding, so the questions and answers flow smoothly and endlessly. However, sometimes when the two sides get heated, the speaker often says "next question," and they immediately stop and do not argue anymore. I remember that on February 20th, before the oral inquiries, I heard news from England that the British Cabinet would send the Secretary of State for India, Lawrence, the First Lord of the Admiralty, Alexander, and the President of the Board of Trade, Cripps, to India to resolve the Indian political problem. Then, Indian National Congress member Ayyangar spoke: "I am very happy to hear that the British Cabinet is sending members to India. I hope they will succeed in everything." He won applause from the entire venue. After the oral inquiries at each assembly meeting, there is a discussion. They argue fiercely over each bill. When the speaker puts the motion to a vote, if the opposition party members agree, they all say: "Aye (I)." This "Aye" means "I agree with this case (I agree With It)." The government party members say "No" in unison. Therefore, the opposition party members, that is, those who agree with this case, walk from the left side of the assembly hall to the room on the right side to sign, and the government party members all walk to the room on the left side to sign. Then, both sides return to their original seats, and the speaker counts the votes to determine the passage or rejection of this bill. If this case passes and the opposition party wins, the government party members will also respond with applause, without any unhappy expressions, demonstrating a democratic spirit.</p>
<p>After each bill is passed by the Central Legislative Assembly (or the Lower House), the Council of States (or the Upper House) has the right to review it again. The Upper House is composed of people with political experience and senior officials, with 60 members, of which 33 are elected and 27 are appointed by the Governor-General. Among these 27 people, officials cannot exceed 19, and the rest are non-officials. The chairman of the Upper House is appointed by the Governor-General, and the term of office for members is five years, but the Governor-General has the power to extend or shorten it. After all bills are passed by both the Upper and Lower Houses, the Governor-General can still return them for reconsideration or veto them. From this, we can see that the current legislative power in India is divided between the Governor-General and the Upper and Lower Houses. The Central Legislative Assembly is not a true legislative body, because the true legislative body is of course the British Parliament. However, the Central Legislative Assembly has the power to make laws for the Indian mainland. However, the British Parliament has the power to make various legal provisions for India, and the Central Legislative Assembly has no power to change or repeal them unless instructed or permitted by the British Parliament. Although India has not yet gained complete freedom and independence, the various measures of the legislative bodies are very democratic. (Sent from Calcutta on April 14)</p>

<h3 id="e62">City Council Elections Held Enthusiastically and Tensely All Day Long, with National Flags Flying Everywhere as Morning Whistles Sounded, Disruptions Occurred in Several Places, Voting Suspended <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Shanghai's first general election for city councilors (a total of 181 seats) unfolded yesterday amidst tension and disruptions, turning a historically significant democratic page!</p>
<p>At six o'clock in the morning, whistles sounded, and national flags flew throughout the city. Voters in each district began voting. By about nine o'clock, the election reached its peak. Mayor Qian also went to the Bund Park to vote as a voter in the first district at this time. Wu Kaixian, Director of the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, also went to his district, Jing'an Temple, to vote early in the morning at eight o'clock. After voting, he went to the polling places of each district and vocational group in person to observe.</p>
<p>Tension and Disruptions Occurred. General elections were still new for Shanghai, so disputes inevitably occurred in several places. Among them, at the Taishan District’s Sino-French High School polling place in the fifth district, a dispute arose due to alleged vote-buying. In the Changning District of the fifth district, the election was suspended because of the disorder of voters, with more than 10,000 ballots lost. In the 13th district (Putuo District), voters crowded at Yufo Temple on Binlang Road, causing damage to the temple's doors and windows and causing a moment of tension, but the situation calmed down after mediation, and the election continued as usual. Vote-buying also occurred in the 19th district (Yulin District), causing a brawl and suspending the election. In the 26th district (Longhua District), a shooting incident occurred due to misunderstandings between the police and security forces. Later, according to opinions from all sides, voters bravely stood up to report bribery, vote-buying, and other irregularities, which eventually led to brawls and shootings. This was considered a good phenomenon during the election.</p>
<p>Vocational Group Re-election Completed. According to unofficial estimates, of the two million voters in the city, more than six-tenths actually participated in voting. Ballot boxes from various district polling places will be concentrated at district offices for counting at nine o'clock this morning, with city government officials supervising the counting. The list of elected councilors for each district should be announced within a few days.</p>
<p>Elections for the five vocational groups were also held yesterday at the venues designated by each group, separately and sequentially. Among them, the election for the Municipal Education Association group adopted a direct election method, while the other four groups, the Chamber of Commerce, Trade Union, Farmers' Association, and Free Professions, were re-elected by their primary election representatives to choose city councilors. The elections for each group went well, and the voting and counting procedures were completed as scheduled.</p>
<p>Investigating the Facts and Scheduling a Re-election. Zhang Xiaosong, Director of Civil Affairs, told reporters yesterday: "In terms of the election situation reported by each district, the general impression should be good. As for the districts where elections were suspended due to disputes, we are investigating the actual situation and will determine the date for a re-election after judgment." He also hoped that all parties would pay close attention to the provisions regarding invalid elections, invalid election, and litigation. According to Chapter 6 of the Municipal Council Election Regulations: "(1) If there is election fraud involving one-third or more of the names on the voter registration list, and the court renders a final judgment; or the election procedures violate the law and the court renders a final judgment, the election is invalid. (2) If the elected person dies or is unqualified, and the court renders a final judgment; or if the number of votes is false, and the court renders a final judgment, the elected is invalid. (3) In the event of an invalid election, a re-election shall be held within ten days after the court renders a judgment. (4) If it is confirmed that there is election fraud or the elected person is unqualified; or if the defeated candidate believes that he should have been elected, he may file a lawsuit, but it must be filed within seven days after the election results are announced. (5) Election lawsuits shall be judged before other types of lawsuits and shall be concluded in the first instance."</p>
<p>Tearing Up Ballots Arouses Public Outrage. The situations in various districts where disputes occurred are reported as follows: (1) In the Taishan District (Fifth District), the most crowded place was inside the Sino-French School on Xizang South Road. In the afternoon, voters lined up to the corner of Jinling Road. When reporters entered, they encountered a dispute. It turned out that the election supervisor, Mo Yousan, who kept accounts at a Jin Xian Restaurant, tore up six ballots, including two for Yang Fusheng, two for Wang Zhengting, and two for Zhou Lianze, arousing public outrage among the voters. He was immediately seized and handed over to the patrol officer on duty, who sent him to the police station for detention. However, he was bailed out by District Chief Zhu Wende. Soon after, Tong Ruihua, a clerk at the same place, was found to be withholding more than 20 ballots cast by voters for candidate Yang Fusheng and not putting them into the ballot box, also causing an uproar. Later, Mao Yingqin, the person in charge of the venue, returned part of the ballots to the original voters and handed over his reception ribbon and badge, along with nine other ballots, to patrol officer Yang Wentao for safekeeping, ordering him to testify for investigation. Also, at another polling place in the district, Lagenna Elementary School, someone was handing out ballots at the entrance, urging the crowd to vote for Lu Cha, arousing public outrage, but the distributor eventually fled into the crowd.</p>

<h3 id="e63">Snippets from Polling Places <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, at 8:00 AM, Wu Kaixian, Director of the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, went to the Gubat Apartment in his district, Jing'an, to vote. He happened to encounter a small dispute at the polling place. Director Wu personally mediated the dispute. A young man asked: "Who are you?" Director Wu smiled and said that he was someone who could resolve disputes.</p>
<p>After Director Wu cast his vote, a reporter asked him, "Who did you vote for?" He smiled again: "I'm afraid it's not convenient to say. But it's probably someone I know."</p>
<p>A 53-year-old Mrs. Cheng in Bund Park took a ballot but didn't know where to go. When asked who she voted for on the paper, she said: "I don't know. That gentleman wrote it for me."</p>
<p>The reporter first went to Bund Park in Huangpu District and praised the orderly atmosphere. But when they hurried to other places, the situation was very different and disappointing. It turned out it was because of the difference between the people and the place. Readers probably remember that the mayor voted in Bund Park.</p>
<p>The most important part of the "voting" work was providing transportation, using cars to transport voters to the polling places. Several blue trucks of the Chinese Relief and Rehabilitation Administration also came out in Nanshi with large flags.</p>
<p>It is said that the candidate who spent the most on entertaining guests was Mr. Yang. It is said that he hosted banquets at the Great China Hotel for 15 days, 15 tables each day, inviting all the residents of the district to participate at will, resulting in a bill of two million several hundred thousand yuan, with a total expenditure of over 40 million yuan.</p>
<p>A illiterate man took three ballots and wanted to hire someone to write for him. When asked who he wanted to vote for, he said very generously, "Whoever has the most, just choose them." A substitute voter said, "You vote for so-and-so!" He said, "Okay! Okay! Okay!"</p>
<p>Six or seven voters were whispering and discussing in front of the Sino-French High School in Taishan District. Some said: "He promised to give us money, but now he doesn't give it to us. We don't want to vote for him."</p>
<p>Cinderella Ballroom is one of the polling places in Xincheng District. The entrance was filled with small tables, especially for voters to sign in. The place was relatively spacious, and although there were many people, the order was still good. The first name on the list of candidates was Mr. Chen Taoyi. An old gentleman wrote Mr. Chen's name neatly on the ballot and put it into the ballot box. When the reporter told him that Mr. Taoyi had passed away, he couldn't help but feel lost.</p>
<p>Most of the voters were extremely impatient, breaking many doors and windows, especially in Putuo District. Tian'an Church in Laozha District only opened one door in the morning. The place was small and crowded, and as a result, the gate was simply closed. Unexpectedly, Shanghai's first ever election was held with the door closed! It was only opened once after a batch of voters finished voting, and the voters who returned were full of complaints.</p>
<p>A rickshaw puller from Sichuan, Hu Ningsheng (resident of No. 98 Wangjia Ancestral Hall, 28 years old), hid 300 ballots to run errands for the person who entrusted him. As a result, they didn't get to the ballot box but walked into the police station.</p>
<p>The election of the City Chamber of Commerce began at about 9:00 AM. A total of 268 delegates attended. The polling place was filled with a long table covered with white cloth. The voters sat face to face, quietly, with a cup of tea and a pencil, looking like they were holding a forum. Famous figures from the industrial and commercial sectors had all attended. Each time the results of the vote were announced, the chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, Wang Xiaolai, raised his voice and announced them publicly.</p>
<p>Du Yuesheng, despite his long illness, also attended in person yesterday, sitting in a reclining chair in the back of the stage, chatting enthusiastically with Director Wu and Xu Jilong. After the second vote was announced, Wang Xiaolai loudly announced that Mr. Du Yuesheng had been elected with 187 votes, Du immediately bowed and nodded frequently to the delegates on stage to express his gratitude.</p>
<p>The election of the Education Association group was held in the gymnasium of Gezhi Middle School. It is said that there were more than 4,000 members in total. Entering the polling place, it was seen that female teachers accounted for the vast majority. Chen Su, a specialist from the Social Affairs Bureau, sat there very seriously, surrounded by desks. Each voter had to pass through 25 desks from entering the door through checking credentials, issuing tickets, writing tickets, and voting.</p>
<p>Participants in the Free Professions group election included journalists, lawyers, accountants, doctors, etc., so the progress of various election methods was discussed in great detail, and the most opinions were expressed. As a result, everything was decided by the public. The ranking of the eleven candidate councilors was also decided by drawing lots. Twenty or so delegates gathered in a small room on the third floor of the Central Daily News on Yuanmingyuan Road, and the voting process appeared enthusiastic and tense.</p>
<p>The Trade Union election venue was borrowed from the Ningbo Association Hall. More than 300 people attended. One or two of the elected councilors happily ran to the microphone on the stage and broadcasted words of thanks to the whole audience.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaosong, Director of Civil Affairs, arrived at the Civil Affairs Office at 5:30 AM to sit and oversee the situation. He said: "I didn't have time to eat breakfast, so I bought two sets of scallion pancakes and fried dough sticks to fill my stomach temporarily." Around 9:00 AM, phone calls from various districts came one after another, and he had a hard time keeping up. He spent 400 yuan for a set meal for lunch. The situation calmed down in the afternoon. He said: "There are no wars on any front."</p>
<p>Yesterday, the voting situation at Zhenhua Elementary School in the fifth district was very enthusiastic. Thanks to the efforts of Zhu Jiasheng, Director of the Election Affairs in the area, and Wu Guanghan and Huang Guangyi, representatives of the district, the order was good.</p>
<h3 id="e64">Gunfire Suddenly Erupts in the Hongqiao District; Commissioner and Chief Beaten Severely <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>At the Hongqiao District election venue, located at Hongxi Elementary School, the candidates, according to reports, included Chen Xuewen, Ding Shanming, Shen Yide, and others. Yesterday, Zhou Zuwang, the director of the Pingmin Xiyi Institute (People's Vocational Training Institute), led 846 commoners to the venue, requesting 800 ballots. They ultimately obtained 700. When entering the venue, they were accompanied by six police officers from the Security Police Squad and staff from the institute. At that time, a local resident named Yao Guoxiong, dressed in Western attire and carrying a firearm, was noticed by personnel from the district office, who advised him to relinquish his weapon. This was discovered by a police officer from the Security Squad, who took both the man and the gun to a nearby police station. He was later released on bail. Guoxiong, feeling he had lost face, fired seven or eight shots, fortunately without injuring anyone. When Commissioner Yan of the Social Affairs Bureau and the institute director went out to investigate, unexpectedly, some villagers blamed Yan and Zhou, surrounded them, beat them severely, and threw them into the river, causing serious injuries. They were later sent to the hospital for treatment. Afterwards, He, the head of the Longhua Branch Bureau, personally led his subordinates late at night to investigate the details and report them to the General Bureau for review and action.</p>

<p>On a pleasant afternoon, Xing Hua Lou restaurant on Fuzhou Road presented a lively and harmonious scene. Qian Da-jun, Yu Hong-jun, Minister, and many other important figures appeared successively among the crowd.</p>
<p>Guests arrived one after another, signed their names under the guidance of five staff members, and were then led to the hall by ushers. The hall was decorated brilliantly and captivatingly.</p>
<p>Around 3:00 PM, the hall was already packed, with latecomers finding it nearly impossible to squeeze in. At this moment, someone suddenly spoke through the loudspeaker, asking the guests to make way. Then, Qian, the Mayor and the marriage officiant, Pan Gongzhan, the introducer, and Shi Geng, looking radiant, quickly entered the venue.</p>
<p>After the marriage officiant and others took their places, amidst the applause of the crowd, our groom, Chen Xunyu, dressed in formal attire, walked at a measured pace through the crowd of elegantly dressed guests, offering nods of gratitude to the attendees with a knowing smile.</p>
<p>Following the groom, of course, came the bridesmaids and the bride. At this moment, the hall quieted down from the excitement, and every guest seemed to crane their necks.</p>
<p>To the beautiful strains of the wedding march, the bride finally made her way to the platform. At this time, the guests turned their heads from left to right, with thousands of eyes fixed on the bride.</p>
<p>Mayor Qian, the marriage officiant, began to speak, addressing the groom as "Brother Xunyu," and congratulating the bride and groom on their everlasting love and lifelong happiness.</p>
<p>The introducer, Mr. Pan Gongzhan, delivered a speech in a humorous tone, saying, "I am a ready-made introducer, because I did not know about Brother Xunyu's marriage beforehand. It was only after I returned to Chongqing that I learned he was engaged in Shanghai." Minister Yu Hongjun addressed the gathering, expressing his admiration for the groom's "character as a person" and explaining that he had come specifically from Nanjing to attend the wedding.</p>
<p>Cheng Zhonghang, the Jiangsu Provincial Inspector, announced the love story of the bride and groom, and congratulated the newlyweds with "glory and victory," explaining: "Mr. Chen's ability to obtain such a virtuous wife is a victory, and for the bride to be matched with such a successful figure can be said to be glorious."</p>
<p>Wang Xiaolai, the chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, congratulated the newlyweds with the three words "Truth, Beauty, Goodness," saying, "Truth is sincere love, beauty is a happy marriage, and goodness is a perfect union."</p>
<p>Yesterday, in the hall, every guest enjoyed a precious gift: "Chen Wangfu's Happy Event" cigarettes specially made by the Fuhua Tobacco Company. The fragrant smoke added infinite interest to the guests.</p>
<p>Although there were many guests, the order was excellent, which was undoubtedly due to the chief steward, Director Sun Jialiang of the branch bureau. He personally directed, running around busily, his hard work was commendable.</p>
<p>Guest List: The guests included: Qian Dajun, Yu Hongjun, Xu Kan, Pan Gongzhan, Wu Kaixian, Cheng Zhonghang, Wu Shaozhu, Chen Xing, Ye Suzhong, Qian Yongming, Du Yuesheng, Dong Xian Guang, Hu Jianzhong, Wu Rencang, Wu Jingxiong, Li Zhongxiang, Fan Zhengbo, Zhu Zongliang, Zuo Shunsheng, Sheng Zhenwei, Liu Hongsheng, Liu Gongyun, Wu Qiding, Yu Songjun, Zhao Zukang, Chen Shiquan, Chen Baohua, Chen Bozhuang, Xu Xueyu, Luo Yunyan, Xie Chengyu, Liu Baimin, Wei Jingmeng, Wang Xinheng, Sun Qinchi, Ke Xin, Zhu Xubai, Xu Jiqing, Xi Yushu, Li Shuming, Zhang Shizhao, Qin Runqing, Jin Runxiang, Wang Xiaolai, Huang Jinrong, Xu Shihao, Tao Baichuan, Wang Yansong, Wang Zhixin, Yu Zuoting, Xu Yongzuo, Shen Tianxin, Li Zufan, Shi Shouchang, Zhou Peizhen, Tang Boqi, Song Xunlun, Zhang Yishu, Du Weifan, Guo Lanxin, Wu Yaqin, Ren Jinpin, and more than a thousand people including fellow businessmen Feng Youzhen and Li Zikuan.

<p>Scattered Ballots, Election Halted (29th District (Changning District)): Due to chaos at the polling stations and scattered ballots, the election process was completely halted within three hours of its start. Changning District had three polling stations: the first at Fudan Middle School on Haig Road, the second at the Central Research Institute at the end of Yuyuan Road, and the third at St. John's University. At around 9:00 AM, as voters continued to arrive at the polling station, the candidate Gu Zhu-hong had people commission numerous large trucks loaded with voters to the polling station and many people held white flags, campaigning inside and outside the venue, the order suddenly became chaotic. The air inside the venue was tense, and over ten thousand blank ballots were suddenly scattered all over the ground. Moreover, some people in the venue brought pre-filled ballots to the polling stations at Fudan Middle School and the Central Research Institute. One youth held more than ten ballots. His classmates, feeling indignant, started a conflict, which ultimately led to violence. Therefore, the elections at these three famous schools were announced to be suspended at 10:30 AM. Gu Zhuqi, the central figure in this disturbance, is from northern Jiangsu, and the voters he brought were mostly his fellow villagers.</p>
<p>Guarding the Ballot Boxes, A Vicious Brawl (3rd) The 19th District (Yulin District) had a total of twenty-four candidates, with four official seats for senators. The district had four polling stations. Yesterday morning at 8:30 AM, over a hundred people, holding small flags with the name of candidate Yang Zhiqian written on them, entered the venue. They stationed themselves at each of the four ballot boxes with 20 people to each box, snatched the stamps from the staff at the venue, and stamped ballots arbitrarily, distributing them to voters in large quantities. The ballots flew in the air like leaflets, causing a dispute. Meng Zicai, the chief of the district office, and Fang Daqu, the section chief of the Civil Affairs Bureau, came out to mediate, but were beaten and injured. The troublemakers also smashed tables and chairs, throwing the order into chaos. When Xiang Changquan, the deputy director of the Civil Affairs Bureau, heard the news, he immediately arrived and was extremely indignant. He immediately ordered the election to be stopped and rescheduled. Shortly after, the Yulin Road Police Station was informed and dispatched police to suppress the situation, taking eight leaders of the incident, as well as the injured Meng Zicai, Fang Daqu, and five assistants from the district office, to the station.</p>

<p>In various professional groups, it is almost a sure thing. Unexpectedly, in the election venue of free professional groups, I heard that a "dark horse" came out.</p>
<p>Among the voters of free professional groups, there are lawyers and accountants with the most thorough thinking, and there are "predictions" for this election of municipal senators, very many and most of them very effective. Especially the scientifically minded doctors, and also a few journalists with rich social experience. With such a high level of knowledge, of course, they may not be subject to any restrictions or influences.</p>
<p>The candidate whose photos were published the most, and the candidate whose campaign speeches were the most moving - were also the representatives of free professional groups.</p>
<p>However, because the people who voted are all of a considerable level, during the election, they will only rely on their own rational judgment.</p>
<p>We are very happy that in the election of journalists, Mr. Zhao Junhao, the deputy editor-in-chief of our newspaper, was finally elected in an extremely difficult environment.</p>
<p>This is definitely not a "dark horse"! Close-up of Zhao Junhao</p>
<h3 id="e67">Food Minister Xu Kan Discusses Current Food Policy Measures: Decisive Quantity Control, Price Opening, and Expanding Grain Sources <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>Food Minister Xu Kan, who recently arrived in Shanghai, is, according to President Song's instructions, planning various measures for the city's food policy and instructing the Shanghai Special Commissioner's Office to handle it properly. Recently, with U.S. President Representative Hoover about to visit China for inspection, he is busy organizing various materials, and his official duties are becoming increasingly complicated. Yesterday, the reporter visited the Food Administration Special Commissioner's Office to inquire about important measures related to the current food policy. Mr. Xu took time out of his busy schedule to briefly inform us about the food policy measures as follows:</p>
<p>The General Situation of Food at Present: Mr. Xu said: In this war, the production of agricultural countries around the world has shrunk, and famine is inevitable. Now that the tangible enemies of the world have been defeated, the intangible enemies of famine and disease are on the rise, and we must rely on the joint efforts of the allied countries to overcome the difficulties. As for overcoming famine, there are only two ways: international mutual assistance and self-reliance. The former, the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, has made its best efforts. China, having suffered agricultural damage in the long war of resistance, and the vastness of the disaster-stricken areas last year, should of course receive more food supplies. Last year, the UN agreed to provide us with 90,000 tons of rice. From January to March this year, it agreed to provide another 47,200 tons of rice. Recently, it was decided to allocate 115,000 tons of rice from April to June, but this number is still considered insufficient given China's population area and wartime disaster situation, and the Executive Yuan is continuing to request increased allocation.</p>
<p>Extremely Welcoming to Mr. Hoover: Recently, U.S. President Representative Hoover will be visiting China to inspect the famine situation, and we express our warmest welcome and expectations. At present, a small number of people in friendly countries still lack knowledge of the food shortage in our country. Mr. Hoover's trip will certainly obtain some practical information for reference. I believe that after he returns to his country, he will be able to appeal on our behalf in many ways to obtain more relief food. As for self-reliance, the Ministry of Food has been working towards this goal over the years. The current facilities are to strengthen storage and transportation to adjust surpluses and deficits on the one hand; and to call for frugality and reduce waste on the other hand. Recently, a large batch of grain stored in Sichuan Province is about to be transported down, and the surplus grain collected and stored in Jiangxi and Fujian over the years is also being rushed to aid Hunan, Guangdong, and other provinces. In general, the Ministry of Food is always paying attention to adjusting the food supply in various parts of the country, and has not been slack. If this year's harvest is bountiful and the UN food can be transported in large quantities, there is really no need to worry about the future of domestic food supply.</p>
<p>Unblocking Sources and Suppressing Grain Prices: As for grain prices, Mr. Xu said: The Ministry has its own methods for stabilizing grain prices in various parts of the country. After the victory of the War of Resistance, grain prices in the rear provinces were very stable. In the recovered provinces, due to population migration and transportation difficulties, there were inevitably some fluctuations. The only countermeasure of the Ministry is to control prices with quantity, open up grain sources, and gradually stabilize them. Taking Shanghai as an example, most of the grain merchants before the war have changed or stopped their business. After the recovery, the organization and operating power of grain merchants were greatly weakened, and they unanimously requested government loans to help them. After several considerations, it was decided to loan. A loan review panel for grain merchants was organized, with representatives from the Ministry's Special Commissioner's Office, the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, the Shanghai Municipal Provisional Council, the Shanghai Municipal Bean and Rice Industry Association, and the Bank of China, jointly reviewing. All merchants applying for loans must go through the prescribed procedures, and the procedures are very strict. This method is actually to enrich the source of grain in Shanghai and adjust people's food. However, at the beginning of the implementation, there may inevitably be loopholes, which should be prevented at any time and gradually improved to achieve perfection. In the first half of this month, the grain price in Shanghai was still stable, and the source of food was also more prosperous. In recent days, there has been a fluctuation again. Although this is related to the source and the price in the producing area, there are still elements of speculation and profiteering, the public security authorities and relevant agencies are closely watching, and will take effective measures to stabilize the people's lives. The Ministry is also working hard to clear the source of grain and strictly prohibit speculation.</p>
<p>The Situation of Military Grain Preparation in the Country: Finally, the reporter asked about the situation of military grain preparation in the country. Mr. Xu said: Improved methods have been set for the preparation of military grain in various provinces, and the provinces are now actively handling them in accordance with the regulations. However, in some places, due to security, transportation, and disasters, transportation is very difficult. The Ministry and the logistics department are now working hard to overcome these problems, so that there will be no shortage before the autumn harvest.</p>

<p>(Reported by this newspaper) At the Railway Hotel in Gaoshou Lane 245, Jier Road, at about 2:00 PM on the 25th, a male and female traveler came to rent a room. The waiter led them to room T2, and the male, Shen Jun (35 years old, from Nanxun), and the female, Chen Aidi (23 years old, from Suzhou), filled out the registration book. They stayed in the room that night. The next morning, they got up at dawn and went to the North Station to buy military tickets, but failed. They then returned to the hotel. Chen Aidi lay down on the bed and fell asleep. After half an hour, the waiter suddenly heard a cry for help from the room. He managed to open the door and saw the male traveler, Shen Jun, looking flustered, rushing out. Upon entering the room, he saw that the female guest's neck was tightly bound with a trouser belt, and she was barely breathing. The hotel urgently reported to the North Station Police Bureau and sent the woman to the hospital. Her life is in danger. The motive for the attempted murder may be a love dispute. The police station in charge is investigating.</p>

<p>(Reported by this newspaper) At 2:00 PM the day before yesterday, U.S. military police in six or seven jeeps arrived near the Dasing Company on Liuhe Road and confiscated all the goods in the glass cases of thirty-six street vendors. The street vendor Xie Zhaode, in an attempt to grab back his items, was injured in the foot by a jeep. However, most of the confiscated goods were not smuggled U.S. military supplies, such as eyeglasses from Maochang Company, Marius cigarettes on which taxes had been paid, and striped silk fabrics bought from Baodaxiang and other stores. The loss per vendor was approximately between 200,000 to 1 million yuan. The vendors went to the MP headquarters in the Huidifeng Building and other places to inquire, and heard that the U.S. military had agreed to return some of the non-illegal goods to the police station for redistribution to the vendors next Tuesday.</p>

<p>Mr. Wu Tiecheng, Secretary-General of the Central Executive Committee, arrived in Nanjing from Chongqing a few days ago to preside over the relocation of the Central Party Headquarters. Yesterday, he flew to Shanghai on a China National Aviation Corporation plane, arriving at Longhua Airport at 4:00 PM. Those who went to the airport to welcome him included Sun Qinchi, representing Mayor Qian, Director Chen Shiquan, as well as Shi Shouchang, Dong Dayou, Huang Jianfen, and over twenty others.</p>
<p>Mr. Wu was wearing a gray woolen hat, a navy blue suit, and a black woolen coat. His hair had grayed, and his face was also clearer than before, but his spirit was still extremely vigorous. After getting off the plane and exchanging greetings with the welcomers, he went to the customs official residence on Yuyuan Road to rest. Mayor Qian and Minister Yu successively visited and had a long conversation. (Note: Both Mr. Wu and Mr. Yu were former mayors of this city. It is indeed a happy occasion that they met with the current mayor after the victory and reminisced about the past.) Mr. Wu then met with the heads of various agencies in Shanghai under the Central Party Headquarters and inquired about various matters. A reporter from the Central News Agency then visited and inquired about the progress of the Central Party Headquarters' relocation to Nanjing and the date of the National Assembly's postponement. Mr. Wu replied, "Most of the personnel of the Central Party Headquarters have already arrived in Nanjing to work. A small number of staff members are waiting due to the shallow waters of the Yangtze River and obstructed shipping. Once the Yangtze River water level rises, they will take a boat directly to Nanjing. As for</p>
<p>The Date of the National Assembly: If the domestic political situation can be resolved according to the path already achieved by the Political Consultative Conference, and the Communist Party has no new demands to raise, then the National Assembly can be held very soon." Mr. Wu then smiled and told the reporter, "The war of resistance has aged people in eight years, but the spirit has not declined. I am extremely excited to be revisiting old haunts today in Shanghai. It is especially a coincidence that Shanghai citizens are enthusiastically holding senatorial elections. It is a pity that I could not arrive yesterday, but I will never give up this right to vote that I should enjoy," and so on.</p>

<p>(Reported by this newspaper) The case of U.S. merchant seaman Weber, who injured U.S. Navy sailor Scripps to death near Broadway and Yongding Road at 11:00 PM on the 8th of this month, has been transferred by the U.S. Consulate General to the Shanghai District Court for investigation according to law. Chief Prosecutor Huang Liang appointed Prosecutor Cao Hong to be responsible for this matter. The court has opened three sessions to investigate, and also brought the defendant to the scene of the incident for an on-site inspection, and took photos. In addition, they went to the U.S. Naval Hospital ship to check the autopsy report and summon witnesses for questioning. The defendant Weber confessed to the facts of the crime without denying it. Therefore, after the investigation was completed, he was prosecuted according to law. Since the occurrence of this case, the Sino-American authorities have attached great importance to it, because this is the first case handled by the Shanghai District Court involving a crime committed by an American after the signing of the Sino-American Agreement on January 11, 1943.</p>
<h3 id="e77">The "Three Old Men" in the Loyal Character Prison <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>Speaking of the "Three Old Men," everyone in Shanghai knows them. During the Japanese occupation of Shanghai, they were involved in nearly every event: openings, weddings, and epitaph writings.</p>
<p>With the arrival of victory, the Military Intelligence Bureau's Shanghai office, admiring their fame, "invited them for a short stay." For several months, they "rested behind closed doors," which actually saved them a lot of trouble from external invitations. On the morning of April 3rd, the Three Old Men were taken in ten jeeps to the Loyal Character Prison in Tilanqiao. The court's decision to house the "Three Old Men" in the Loyal Character Prison, with Liang Hongzhi and others as neighbors, was quite ingenious. Some people once called the Three Old Men the Three Stars of Fortune, Prosperity, and Longevity. Now that the Three Stars have graced the prison with their presence, is this a blessing or a misfortune for the prison?</p>
<p>In prison, Lin Kanghou still wore a neat Western suit, while Mr. Wen and Mr. Yuan removed their long robes and wore short jackets. The "Old Men" each had witty remarks: Wen Lantao said, "If there is heaven, there must be me," hoping for a quick trial and sentencing. Lin Kanghou said, "Others did underground work in Shanghai, I did aboveground work." Yuan Ludeng said, "What Mr. Lin said is exactly what I wanted to say."</p>
<p>Originally, eight out of ten cases of Chinese traitors are said to be related to underground work and meritorious service to the country. As for what the "Three Old Men" said, the details will be revealed during the trial.</p>
<p>Currently, Yuan Ludeng among the "Three Old Men" was the first to be investigated and the first to be publicly prosecuted. The High Court's public trial is imminent. In Shanghai, many people who have long admired the names of the "Old Men" want to see their faces and hear their "patriotic theories." When the time comes, there will surely be a grand spectacle near Tilanqiao. (Mu Ren)</p>

<h3 id="e80">The Everlasting Summer Capital with Rich Southern Flavors: A Tour of the Taipei Museum Botanical Garden <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Mu Yun from Taiwan, Air Mail Report of the 20th from This Newspaper</p>
<p>Taipei is a bright, cultural, and political city, as well as a city of everlasting summer with red flowers, green leaves, and rich southern flavors. More than two hundred years ago, it was just a place for Fujianese people to build ships and engage in械斗, clan fights. After the Japanese management, it has transformed from a vast wilderness into a purely modern city, with a population of 200,000 and 4,426 acres of land. In this new city, we can smell the blood and sweat of the imperialists, and we can also see the hoof marks of the Taiwanese people being oppressed.</p>
<p>We cannot deny the Japanese's hard work, but at the same time, we must be vigilant about how confident we are in controlling and maintaining this existing vitality.</p>
<p>A Museum Tour</p>
<p>In front of the former Governor-General's Office, in the coconut groves of Taipei Park, stands a Western-style building with a dome, which is the museum. The summer atmosphere of the park is unique, with a humid and warm current that makes people forget that Shanghai is still in the cold. The museum was built by the "voluntary contributions" of six million people in the province. It was originally to commemorate Governor-General Kodama and Chief Secretary Gotō, but now Kodama is nowhere to be found, and Gotō has become a prisoner awaiting trial.</p>
<p>A Thoroughbred, Barely Better Than Remains</p>
<p>In the courtyard of the museum, two primitive locomotives are displayed: No. 9, which was first used in Japan (Meiji 5th year) between Yokohama and Shinbashi; and No. 1 "Tengyun," which Qing Dynasty Taiwan Governor Liu Mingchuan bought from Germany for use in Taiwan. To the left of the museum is a leather carriage with only the shell remaining, lying horizontally in the desolate grass of the setting sun, as if it was once the vehicle of Prince Kan'in Kotohito and Princess Chieko. There was also a once-famous, tall horse, now only a skeleton, sinking into the mud in the wind and rain. People no longer remember it when they pass by, and it, like the fate of the Japanese Empire, has declined.</p>
<p>Entrance Ticket NT$0.50</p>
<p>With another NT$0.50 entrance ticket, we entered the building. The female staff members who originally provided guidance and explanations to Japanese visitors are now squatting on the side because they cannot speak the national language. Following the documents of the Japanese surrender, there is the Nanyang Hall, displaying the daily necessities and models of the indigenous people of Nanyang. Then there are the documents of the Gaoshan tribe and the Qing Dynasty, as well as the Japanese rule of Taiwan. What impressed us most was the proclamation of Liu Yongfu, the Imperial Commissioner in charge of Taiwan's defense, and the announcement of the Changhua County Magistrate on February 28th of the 24th year of Guangxu: "A reward of six thousand taels of silver for sinking a large Japanese ship, and a reward of two hundred taels of silver for taking the head of a Japanese general." There is also a red cypress tree from Xin Gaoshan, which germinated in 1026 AD during the fourth year of Emperor Renzong of the Northern Song dynasty, which has a deep historical significance. The Japanese displayed China's national treasures, which was insulting, but they still preserved them and returned them to us. This is exactly the history of Taiwan in the past sixty years. But when we saw the couplet written by Liu Mingchuan, "The holy age is now full of rain and dew, and the virtuous are born here with glory," encouraging Jiasheng to go abroad as an envoy, and then look at the reality of our arrival in Taiwan, we couldn't help but feel terrified!</p>
<p>A Tropical Garden</p>
<p>The most vivid expression of the subtropical scenery is the tropical garden - the botanical garden. The garden is located in the southwest of the city, and buses can take you directly there. From a distance, you can see the towering coconut groves, which, under the reflection of the blue sky, make people fall in love with the southern country of the island.</p>
<p>The Scenery of the Coconut Grove is Delightful</p>
<p>The garden is full of coconut groves mixed with tropical trees of different families. You will definitely prefer the magnificent figure of the Alexander coconut, set off by the tall and slender scarlet clothes of the Taiwanese girls, which complement each other. Under the tall figure, there are scattered rows of small Bonin Island screwpines that look like needles. There are also Australian paperbarks, shady nine-joint trees, mountain palms that bloom with yellow melon-like flowers, old, disheveled pineapples (jackfruit), and rickety banyan trees... [and] the lovely acacia trees...</p>
<p>Listening to the Pine Breeze and the Banana Rain</p>
<p>I love to listen to the pine breeze, but I love to listen to the night rain on the banana leaves even more. There are many banana trees here, although it is not as warm as Tainan, and the climate limits their opportunity to mature early. Perhaps you love to fish. By the shady pond, even young children are quietly holding fishing rods. The shadow of war is like the sunlight passing through the garden, difficult to trace. No, what can be traced is only the bridge leading to the Jian Gong Shrine, the lotus leaves on the water, and the broken steel bones and cement floating horizontally. Only a tilted bronze horse is still struggling with its last courage, standing in the wilderness. The "Institute of Forestry" has changed its name to "Forestry Experimental Station," and the afforestation plan with sixty-two high mountains over 16,000 meters and an area of 36,000 square kilometers is conceived here. This is the nursery of the forest and the nanny of the natural trees.</p>
<p>Emerald Green Talking Parrot</p>
<p>To the northeast of Taipei City, another ten minutes away, you can reach the zoo in Zhongshan Park, which is also a tropical garden. Like the botanical garden, it quietly squats by the Keelung River. A turquoise-green talking parrot with a red beak chirps and greets visitors at the entrance with a wry smile. The small Western-style houses are tightly closed with iron fences and scattered in irregular rows. People can recall that there were tropical animals not long ago, but now most of them are empty. There are only a few apes and monkeys, coveting the bananas and tangerines in the hands of the visitors, two egrets, peacocks with long tails, and white chickens. The only lion left has lost its original ferocity, and the majestic elephant sucking on the iron fence has also been deprived of sufficient nutrition due to high prices, and is as thin as a camel without a bell. You will feel a strong sense of desolation here: sparse people, dilapidated garden scenery, and empty cages of the small animals that have disappeared! And when I discovered the sheep from the northern country lying in the ashes next to the kitchen, bleeding and struggling with a dying life, it increased our hatred for those who could not properly take over! Negligence, perfunctoriness, and irresponsibility have caused the poor animals who have lost their freedom to suffer the same disaster as "fish in the pond."</p>
<p>Hoover on His Way to China, Assisting Truman in Relieving World Food Shortage</p>
<h3 id="e81">Truman's Close Aides: Six Advisors in the White House <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>— Translated by This Newspaper's Translation Department from The New York Times</p>
<p>President Truman's loyalty to his friends is well-known in Washington, and it has caused a complex reaction: some praise it as a virtue, while others say it is a weakness - a weakness that may become a political fatal wound for Mr. Truman and the Democratic Party by 1948. Nevertheless, President Truman has a group of close advisors around him in the White House, and their only common point seems to be the bond of friendship, which, if not uniting them with each other, at least unites them in their unwavering loyalty to their leader, and at the same time unites him personally with their group. This group provides advice to the President, guides his actions, and influences his thinking.</p>
<p>Their talents vary. They came here one after another and have been subjected to public criticism that is only slightly less harsh than that received by some of the "Young Turks" of Roosevelt's staff. Mr. Truman, true to his reputation, holds on tightly to this group of advisors and cannot bear to give them up.</p>
<p>Perhaps people will wonder why a President, in addition to his formal cabinet, needs to establish another more intimate and confidential "Vice Cabinet" to facilitate things? There are three reasons for answering this question: First, no President chooses his own cabinet. Filling the ten important positions in the cabinet requires considering many factors - policies, geography, obedience, and even proper status - which cannot be determined by personal preferences. Second, most presidents feel lonely and isolated after taking office. They need friendly and congenial companions to accompany them. Third, the President is busy with countless affairs and constantly encounters special problems that require special handling.</p>
<p>No one in Truman's inner circle appears as an old politician, like Baruch in President Roosevelt's staff. Nor is there a particularly close confidant, like Roosevelt's confidants Hopkins and Howe.</p>
<p>"White House Advisor" is a very precise name. Its definition varies depending on the interpretation of each individual. The six advisors described in this article are, in the author's opinion, the most outstanding members of the group. As for who among the six is dominant, it is difficult to say.</p>
<p>If this article had been written a month ago, the name of Judge Samuel I. Rosenman would definitely have been included in the list of Mr. Truman's advisors, but the name of Hannegan might have been deleted. If this article had been written a month later, then the names of Chester Bowles, Paul Porter, Wilson Wyatt, and Clark Clifford would have to be added. They are all new staff members.</p>
<p>In addition, there are many other close associates of President Truman whom the author has not included in this article because they stand on the periphery of the White House, rather than at its core. They are experts, not general policy designers.</p>
<p>Mathematical Genius, Hardworking and Keen</p>
<p>Vinson</p>
<p>Secretary of the Treasury Fred M. Vinson, a man in his fifties with thick hair and a heavy build, trained in Southern Democratic politics for nearly forty years, occupies a superior position among President Truman's close advisors. However, when mentioning his political background, we should not overlook that he is the most capable tax and financial expert in the United States. He served in the House of Representatives for fourteen years, and finally served as Chairman of the Taxation Subcommittee of the Ways and Means Committee.</p>
<p>President Truman strives to make use of Vinson's calm judgment, but his greatest strength lies in taxation and financial matters. It was Vinson who persuaded the public and Congress to accept the Bretton Woods financial agreement. He is now launching the same campaign to prepare for the debate on loans to Britain.</p>
<p>To succeed in this difficult and specialized work, one must have a mathematical genius and a hardworking spirit. These two virtues, this upright and amiable "Judge," have long been known to the world. In addition, he brings to President Truman a sensitive political understanding, a broad and friendly relationship in the White House, sound common sense, and warm personal friendships. The room he has opened in the Wardman Park Hotel is a favorite social gathering place for President Truman, where he often spends an evening playing cards with friends.</p>
<p>Bearing Heavy Responsibilities, Reserved and Solemn</p>
<p>Snyder</p>
<p>John W. Snyder, as reserved and solemn as a church deacon, sits in a simple office in the White House, leisurely managing the nation's economic affairs. The Director of the Office of War Mobilization and Reconversion, a position he holds, is one of the most demanding positions in the government. It is no exaggeration to say that he is President Truman's "right hand" in every economic matter, from civil to military. Recently, he has been criticized for being too rigid and ordinary in his duties, unable to keep up with the changing and rapid dynamics. His impression on most people is that of a figure in the noisy Washington atmosphere.</p>
<p>Truman's relationship with Byrnes would be counterproductive, because until the last minute, Truman's name as a vice-presidential candidate replaced Byrnes' name. The two men had always respected each other since serving together in the Senate. Byrnes's entry into Truman's cabinet was not because he had profound knowledge of diplomacy or international issues, but because of his quick mind and skillful handling of affairs.</p>
<p>Byrnes stepped down from his comfortable position on the Supreme Court in October 1942 to take over the civilian part of the National Resources Planning Board, becoming President Roosevelt's veritable "Vice President." However, when he took office as Secretary of State last June, he was not completely lacking in knowledge of international issues. He accompanied the late President to the Yalta Conference, where his shorthand notes served as a reliable guidebook for his leader.</p>
<p>Allen</p>
<p>A few weeks ago, a friend of President Truman said, "Don't just think of George E. Allen as a jester. He is a good-natured man with a lot of humor, but he also takes things seriously. He is an excellent liberal, a good businessman, and he knows how to solve various problems. He will get a good position. You wait and see!"</p>
<p>This prediction has largely come true, and he was soon appointed to a prominent position in a Senate committee. When his appointment was announced, people snickered and expressed doubts about him, but soon the malicious snickers turned into kind smiles, and Allen's humorous demeanor made his doubters cast their votes of confidence for him. Allen's supporters had long anticipated this victory because his witty remarks and cheerful personality have been of interest to the Washington political scene for more than a decade. He is not only good at socializing, but also has discerning ability.</p>
<p>Among his friends are prominent figures in the government, such as the late President Roosevelt, most cabinet members, and important figures in both houses of Congress. At the same time, he has a solid position in the business world. In 1944, he was a "Trumanite" in Chicago. According to general rumors, it was Allen who guided Mr. Truman into the White House when Mr. Truman took office as President last April, although he flatly denies this.</p>
<p>Allen is a resourceful, problem-solving, and helpful person. He is involved in almost every secret speech delivered by the President. He is a confidential messenger in the White House. His recent mission was to investigate the management of wartime agencies for President Truman. He is a must-have guest on the President's yacht during weekend trips. The card game will not start until he arrives.</p>
<p>News Secretary with Keen Judgment</p>
<p>Ross</p>
<p>President Truman's Press Secretary Charles G. Ross is probably more valued than any of his predecessors. This position has always been regarded as a liaison office through which news from the White House is transmitted to the public. Ross helps produce the news. He often sits around a table with the President and his advisors, participating in important policy discussions.</p>
<p>Ross was the smartest student in his class when he studied at Independence High School, graduating with the highest honors. Truman admired him very much, and has done so for forty years. The President values his old friend's extensive knowledge, rich experience as a reporter and editor for twenty years, and his keen judgment of people. Ross is a tall and slightly hunchbacked man with a worried and gloomy expression on his face. His thin face and his unwavering loyalty to President Truman are reminiscent of the late Hopkins.</p>
<p>Veteran Cabinet Member with Admirable Humility</p>
<p>Hannegan</p>
<p>Postmaster General Robert E. Hannegan is a newly added senior advisor in the White House. Although he is a veteran cabinet member and a Missourian, he has never been placed in President Truman's circle of close friends. Indeed, he still hasn't. When Truman ran for senator in 1940, the two men had fallen out, and that's one thing. They never agreed on anything in discussions of party policy, and that's another thing. In such situations, it was often President Truman who made concessions, and that is why Hannegan was able to occupy a seat in the inner circle of the White House. After many turbulent meetings, Truman found that most of his subordinates, regardless of their merits or demerits, had become political liabilities. Since then, Hannegan, in his capacity as Chairman of the Democratic National Committee, has participated in various strategy planning meetings and often expressed many opinions on the appointment of new people. Hannegan was appointed as the Commissioner of Internal Revenue by President Roosevelt in 1943. From then on, he quickly rose to prominence. In January of the following year, the Democratic National Committee elected him as the chairman of the committee. (24th)</p>
<h3 id="e82">The Mud of Changsha <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Gao Yuanli, by Air Mail from this Newspaper on the 18th</p>
<p>"Four Battles and One Fire" have caused Changsha to undergo several vicissitudes. Although it has been seven months since its recovery, the scars have not been slightly washed away. Wherever you go, the traces of the war are still evident. Several stone-paved asphalt roads are full of bullet holes, bumpy and uneven. The municipal authorities have mobilized Japanese prisoners to repair them, but because they lack tools and materials, they have only added some mud. After the rain, the streets are still muddy, making it even more difficult to walk than if they were not repaired.</p>
<p>Garbage Relocation Fees Increase the Severity of the Housing Shortage</p>
<p>The central work of the municipal authorities seems to be focused on opening up sources of revenue. In recent months, house taxes, banquet taxes, and slaughter taxes have all been the focus of public discussion. Therefore, all the work of tidying up the city's appearance has been neglected. Garbage is everywhere. The Provincial Health Department has estimated that garbage occupies 40% of the total area of Changsha. The fire grounds are no longer grounds, but small hills. If you are the owner of that piece of land and are preparing to build a house, you will first have to pay a garbage relocation fee of more than one million. This small problem makes it impossible for houses in Changsha to increase rapidly, thus exacerbating the housing shortage.</p>
<p>The impassability of the ditches makes it difficult to walk in the city after rain. The enemy occupied Changsha for more than a year and paid no attention to municipal administration. Eighty percent of the sewers are blocked. The municipal authorities are limited by manpower and financial resources and have no way to deal with it. They have no choice but to entrust this important work to the people themselves. Therefore, merchants in various streets have voluntarily raised funds to repair them. There has indeed been a lot of construction in recent months, but there is a lack of overall planning. If it is open here but blocked there, it is as good as not repairing it.</p>
<p>Many Military and Civilian Corpses Buried in Fire Ground Garbage Dumps</p>
<p>During the Fourth Battle of Changsha, many soldiers and civilians in the city were martyred, especially during the period when the enemy occupied the city, and many people were killed by the enemy. These corpses were buried in the fire grounds and garbage dumps. Various charitable organizations in Changsha organized a Military and Civilian Remains Collection and Burial Committee to be responsible for handling the matter. After three months of excavation and burial, more than 3,000 bodies have been exhumed in the urban area, but in fact, I am afraid there are still some that have not been discovered, and there are many places where unexploded bombs remain. Therefore, people living in the urban area are wary, fearing that disaster will arise from within, and at the same time, with the arrival of summer, they are afraid of the spread of plague. Families who are too cautious have even moved to the countryside to live to ensure safety.</p>
<p>Rent of Ten Piculs of Rice Only Rents a Three-Bay House</p>
<p>"It is not easy to live in Changsha." Not only is there the threat of environmental hygiene, but the pressure of food and housing makes people unable to breathe. Although the price of houses in Changsha is not calculated in gold bars like in Shanghai, but in rice as the standard, a small room costs at least one picul of rice per month, and three months or half a year must be prepaid. An ordinary house with three bays costs ten piculs of rice per month. Public school teachers at the middle and lower levels are constantly complaining. Although the municipal government has a rent evaluation committee, it does not have any effect. The food problem has still not been solved. From the end of February, the price of medium-grade rice at 27,000 to 28,000 yuan per picul was only stable for a month and a half. On April 12, it rose sharply again, increasing by 5,000 to 6,000 yuan per day. After three days of rising prices, today (April 15) the price of rice is already 45,000 yuan per picul. It is said that a large number of troops are gathering in the Bin Hu area, consuming a lot of food, and there is a lack of food in southern Hunan, so merchants are rushing to Changsha to buy it. The provincial and municipal authorities have not yet announced any measures to deal with this surge in food prices. The People's Grain Company, which was established earlier, transported thousands of piculs of grain from Bin Hu. It is said that it will hold a fair price sale in Changsha, but I am afraid it will not become a reality in the near future.</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang Approved Additional Allocations for Hunan Agricultural Loans and Food Loans</p>
<p>The good news brought back by Mr. Zhao Yanwu from Chongqing also could not suppress the price of food. Mr. Zhao made urgent appeals to the central government and various parties in Chongqing for the Hunan disaster and received enthusiastic responses. Chairman Chiang approved an additional allocation of 100 million yuan for Hunan agricultural loans, 50 million yuan for food loans, and 50,000 bags of wheat flour, and the Ministry of Food allocated 200,000 piculs of grain each from Sichuan and Jiangxi to help Hunan. If this huge amount of money and materials can arrive in the short term, then perhaps things will be better during the time when the green and yellow crops are not yet available. However, judging from the current traffic situation, 400,000 piculs of grain from Sichuan and Jiangxi cannot be transported in the short term.</p>
<p>Farewell Parties Held for Days for the Reorganization of the Provincial Government</p>
<p>The reorganization of the provincial government had been rumored constantly in Changsha before it finally materialized. No one had any special feelings about Wang Lai's departure. Mr. Wu Wusheng governed Hunan for eight months, and only the common people understand his spirit of inaction. Although Mr. Wang Dongyuan governed Hunan as a person from Anhui, Mr. Wang had served in the military in Hunan for many years and knew the situation in Hunan well, so perhaps he could do it more effectively. Mr. Wu is preparing to hand over, and farewell parties from all walks of life are being held every day.</p>
<p>Hu Mai, the former Director of Finance, was accused of corruption not long after he left office, and the local court's procuratorate is investigating the matter. Twenty or thirty officials from the Department of Finance and the Department of Field Tax and Grain Management have been summoned, and Mr. Hu himself has also been summoned twice. The person in charge of the local court said that he will handle the matter according to the law. It is said that Mr. Hu was accused of misappropriating the surplus distribution case of the employee welfare society during his tenure as the Director of the Field Grain Department, the surplus case of grain processing, and the grain allocation case. All newspapers reported that Mr. Hu had paid a bail of 10 million yuan and would be available at any time.</p>
<p>New Company Established to Engage in Export Business of Local Products</p>
<p>Hunan's special products such as tea, tung oil, summer cloth, and firecrackers have always been important materials for export. In recent years, due to the war, sales have been slow and production has declined sharply, causing serious damage to the rural economy. Li Yuyao, Director of the Department of Construction, Liu Xuru, Director of the Department of Social Affairs, and famous figures in the industrial and commercial sectors such as Chen Zhitian and Cui Bohong have initiated the organization of the Hunan Local Products Trade Association to be responsible for promoting sales and improving production. Mr. Chen and Mr. Cui also initiated the establishment of the Hunan Local Products Trade Company with a capital of 100 million yuan to specialize in the export business of Hunan local products. This is indeed aimed at Hunan's needs, and the rural areas of Hunan can also be revived through this.</p>
<p>Only One-Tenth of the 1,000 Allocated Vehicles Are Available</p>
<p>However, whether it is the reorganization of the provincial government or the development of export trade to revive the rural areas, the problem is still transportation. If transportation cannot be quickly and smoothly connected, everything will still fail. Ling Hongxun, Deputy Minister of Transportation, inspected the reconstruction project of the Yuehan Railway and said to reporters in Changsha: "The bridges along the line have been severely damaged and there is an excessive lack of vehicles. Although the completion of the pontoon bridge will allow the passage of large trains, but if you want smooth transportation, you must wait for the vehicles ordered abroad to arrive." The highway situation is also a lack of vehicles. The Fourth Route Army received 5,000 enemy vehicles and transferred them to Shen Dake, the representative of the Wartime Camel Transport Bureau. The Hunan Provincial Highway Bureau allocated 1,000 vehicles at Shen's representative office, but only one-tenth of them are usable. The rest are just a pile of scrap iron. How can this increase highway transportation?</p>
<p>Director Hawkins Cares About the Suffering of the People of Hunan</p>
<p>Recently, what the people of Changsha miss is Mr. Hawkins. Mr. Hawkins was originally the Director of the UNRRA Office in Hunan. He had been to Lingling, Qiyang, Shaoyang, Pingjiang, Liuyang and other places to survey disasters and was very sympathetic to the suffering of the people of Hunan. He had also strived to increase the amount of materials and transport them to Hunan for relief. It is said that Mr. Hawkins contributed the most to the case of the central government approving the exemption of 2 million piculs of military grain from Hunan. Therefore, the people of Hunan miss Mr. Ha Min's departure very much. In the midst of it, he felt a strong unease. In a dispute that he did not fully understand, he unfortunately "got caught in the middle," which made him think of returning to the quiet place in the vice president's office of the First National Bank of St. Louis.</p>
<p>In April 1945, President Truman called him out of this quiet place and successively appointed him as the Director of the Federal Loan Administration and the Director of the Wartime Mobilization and Reconversion Bureau. Although he encountered various difficult problems and although the possibility of him getting rid of some heavy responsibilities was increasing day by day, he still enjoyed President Du's strong trust.</p>
<p>To say that Snyder is President Truman's outstanding economic advisor is tantamount to saying that he is an advisor on general domestic policy. Even if he is not the one providing the advice, he is at least the main medium for conveying it. He himself is not an economist, and his views in this regard are very conservative. Ten days ago, President Truman accepted his proposal to resolve the steel dispute, and President Truman's trust in him has deepened.</p>
<p>Diplomatic Newbie with Strong Skills</p>
<p>Byrnes</p>
<p>The advice provided by President Truman's close advisors is mostly not limited to specialized areas of activity. Secretary of State Byrnes is especially so. President Truman values his clever mind, which can be applied in almost any situation. He knows the intricacies of government activities "perhaps more thoroughly than anyone in Washington." Although Byrnes is a newcomer to diplomatic issues in all aspects, he is still an excellent advisor in this area, occasionally getting help from Chief of Staff Admiral Leahy.</p>
<p>Assuming that at the Democratic National Convention held in Chicago in June 1944, the "wheel of fate" had turned in the other direction, then</p>
<h3 id="e83">Visiting Dr. Ma Yinchu on the Banks of West Lake to Discuss the Future of Economic Development <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Chu Yusheng, from this Newspaper on the 24th, Hangzhou</p>
<p>Anyone who cares about economic issues probably knows Dr. Ma Yinchu, who studies economics. During the Anti-Japanese War, Mr. Ma taught in the rear. After the victory, he went from Chongqing to Shanghai, and then hurriedly from Shanghai to Hangzhou. Mr. Ma's hometown is Shaoxing. In Hangzhou, he has a comfortable Western-style house on Fayuan Road, and he has a happy family. Although he is already 65 years old, his plump face and loud voice make people think he is only 48 or 49 years old. He returned to Hangzhou to see his home and planned to rest on the long-separated West Lake.</p>
<p>The People of Hangzhou Welcome Dr. Ma</p>
<p>The people of Hangzhou warmly welcome Mr. Ma. Almost every day someone asks him to give a speech. All walks of life in Hangzhou held a welcome party for him. When the reporter interviewed Mr. Ma at his residence at No. 34 Fayuan Road, he was busy preparing for a speech.</p>
<p>He is an amiable person, and from his cheerful and lively tone, you can also see that he is a very sincere and upright elder. He and Mr. Kong Xiangxi were classmates, and Mr. Song Ziwen's father taught him English. There could be no better friendship. However, based on economic theory and in the spirit of the Spring and Autumn Annals' criticism of the worthy, he unceremoniously criticized the current measures. In the current era, this kind of criticism is indeed necessary.</p>
<p>He Proposed Five New Proposals</p>
<p>He told the reporter that he had five proposals: First, bureaucratic capital must be eradicated. Second, a certain system is not very good, but its practitioners are often good. He said: "Most of the staff I have seen are very good young people. They are also very diligent, and some of their writings even exceed the level of university graduates." Therefore, he advocated that after a certain system is abolished, a way out should be sought for these good young people. This way out should be the responsibility of those who made money from the national crisis, the victory, and even the spies. They should take out money to run industries so that many good young people can have normal jobs.</p>
<p>The Founding Father Taught that Everyone Should Have Food to Eat</p>
<p>Third, political democracy must precede economic democracy, because everything is built on the economy. If economic democracy is not achieved, political democracy is still empty talk. Regarding economic democracy, he admired the Founding Father's motto: "Everyone should have food to eat." He said: It is not right for everyone to have food to eat, because this lacks the meaning of production and makes it so that one eats and does nothing. "Everyone should have food to eat" contains the meaning of production. He advocated that bureaucratic capital must be abolished so that everyone can work for economic initiative. Fourth, convene a national economic conference. He believed that the economic conference should not only be within the scope of the President and Ministers, but should bring together leaders from industry, agriculture, and commerce, as well as economic experts from all over the country, to discuss matters sincerely.</p>
<p>A Way Out Should Be Arranged for Laid-Off Soldiers</p>
<p>Fifth, he advocated that economic issues should be planned comprehensively. The issue of foreign exchange should be linked to financial issues, because if the government prints money indiscriminately, the exchange rate will still have to change after it is set. However, the financial issue is related to the issue of military consolidation. If military expenditure is huge, currency cannot be contracted. He said: It is possible for finance if the national army is reduced to 50 divisions and the communist army is reduced to 10 divisions. However, the issue of military consolidation is related to industrial policy, because the soldiers who are laid off should have a proper way out. Their way out should be industry. But industrial policy must be decided on tariff protection policy. He said: Britain and the United States regard China as a market, so they do not advocate a tariff protection policy. But our industrial foundation is too fragile. If we do not adopt tariff protection, then this little industry will be completely destroyed. Therefore, he extremely advocated a tariff protection policy. Mr. Ma talked about the above issues all</p>
<p>Find a Way Out to Coordinate Industry and Agriculture</p>
<p>Mr. Ma talked about the above issues with a smile, because he firmly believed that China would definitely have hope.</p>
<p>After he finished speaking, I asked him about the issue of industrial coordination with agriculture that he advocated. He said: "I advocate equal emphasis on industry and agriculture, so industry should be coordinated with agriculture." I said: "Some people say that if industry is coordinated with agriculture, the purchasing power of farmers is not enough." He said again: "For example, if we run a textile factory, we don't have to buy foreign cotton. If we buy foreign cotton, Chinese cotton will have no way out. If you weave cloth and sell it to farmers, the farmers will naturally not be able to afford it. If we buy domestic cotton, the farmers will have money, and they can buy your cloth." Therefore, he advocated that Chinese factories should purchase Chinese raw materials as soon as possible. He also advocated that domestic factories (light industry) should be encouraged to be privately run so that they have competition and progress. It is not right for officials to compete with the people.</p>
<p>The Nine Eastern Provinces Should Be Well Developed</p>
<p>I also asked him about his views on the Northeast issue from the standpoint of economics. His answer was: "The Northeast is an industrial area, and there could be no better place. People should not fight each other again, but should develop it well. It doesn't matter if the Soviet Union takes away the machines, but it's terrible if they want our underground treasures." He was extremely concerned about the Sino-Soviet cooperation in developing the Northeast's resources, which is being discussed.</p>
<p>Zhejiang Province Plans to Develop Agriculture</p>
<p>While we were talking, Mrs. Ma came out. She is a virtuous and dignified lady. She was preparing to accompany Mr. Ma to give a speech. I also took Mr. Ma's car back. In the car, I asked him: How should Zhejiang's economic future develop? He said: "There are few treasures under the ground in Zhejiang, and almost all of them are on the ground, so we can only seek development in agriculture. Zhejiang's silk and tea have a very promising future, but we must improve them well and work hard. In the future, when agriculture is developed, we can exchange agricultural products for industrial products."</p>
<p>During our pleasant conversation, I praised Mr. Ma's health. He told me that his life is regular. He takes a cold shower every morning and a hot shower every afternoon. He reads and eats at a fixed time.</p>
<p>He sent the car to the front of our office. We parted ways here. (Sent from Hangzhou on April 24)</p>

<h3 id="e86">Peking University Shanghai Alumni Association Established <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>[Report from this city] The Shanghai Alumni Association of National Peking University held its inaugural meeting yesterday afternoon. Chairman Xu Shihao passed the draft of the association and resolved to raise funds for the Zimin Library to commemorate the late President Cai Zimin. The association will solicit people from all over the country who admire Mr. Zimin to carry out this project together.

The Ministry of Education has appointed the following personnel: (1) Shandong University: Zhao Tai-mou as President, responsible for preparing for re-establishment; (2) Beiping Normal School: Yuan Dun-li as President, responsible for preparing for re-establishment; (3) Merchant Marine Academy: Zhou Jun-shi as President, concurrently Chairman of the Preparatory Committee; Gao Ting-zi, Liu Hong-sheng, Lu Zuofu, Xu Xue-yu, Wang Guang, Yang Zhi-xiong, Wu Da-ming, Zhou Hong-jing, and others as members of the Preparatory Committee; (4) Beiyang University: Wang Chong-hui as Chairman of the Preparatory Committee; Li Yu-ying, Wang Zheng-ting, Chen Li-fu, He Jie, Ling Hong-xun, Lu En-xu, Mao Yi-sheng (concurrently Secretary), and others as members of the Preparatory Committee; (5) Anhui University: Zhu Guang-qian as Chairman of the Preparatory Committee; Gao Yi-han, Ye Yuan-long, Yang Liang-gong, Zhang Yi, Zhang Zhong-dao, Liu Zhen-ru, Cheng Yan-sheng, Wang Shao-lun, Liu Ying-shi, Tao Yin (concurrently Secretary), and others as members of the Preparatory Committee; (6) Shanghai College of Commerce: He Bing-song as Chairman of the Preparatory Committee; Gao Yin-chu, Peng Hu, Gu Yu-xiu, Xu Pei-kun, Wu Bao-feng, Zhu Guo-zhang, Xu Bai-guo, Diao Pei-ran (concurrently Secretary), and others as members of the Preparatory Committee.</p>

One-third of this capacity will be allocated to the relocation of schools and educational institutions. In late February, the Ministry of Education convened a conference on the relocation of schools, deciding on principles and priorities: (1) For those embarking by ship in Chongqing, priority will be determined by the distance of each school and socio-cultural institution; those closer to Chongqing will go first, and among those at the same distance, those with farther destinations will go first; (2) Following the principle in item one, within the same location, schools will take priority over other institutions; (3) Schools and institutions that can travel by road should utilize roads as much as possible. Schools and institutions should delay relocation to areas that have not yet restored administrative authority after recovery. The Ministry is also urging the Executive Yuan to allocate the approved 60 billion yuan for repairs and renovations. The Ministry of Education is also consulting on ways to increase the number of ship or plane berths to facilitate relocation.

<p>Qualification Review for Students: The qualification review for students above the college level is divided into two categories: currently enrolled and graduates. According to the Measures for Handling the Academic Records of Students Enrolled in Colleges and Universities in Recovered Areas, the general principles are as follows: (1) Currently enrolled students must register, complete supplementary classes, and pass the assessment to be eligible to transfer to other schools; (2) Registration for currently enrolled students will be held in five districts: Nanjing, Shanghai, Wuhan, Guangzhou, and Beiping-Tianjin, and will be handled concurrently by the Educational Reconstruction and Guidance Committee of the Ministry of Education; (3) The Ministry will酌情(discretionarily) establish temporary university supplementary classes in each district; (4) Currently enrolled students must apply for registration in their respective districts within the prescribed time limit, submitting a registration form, a guarantee, and presenting academic credentials. Students who attended politically hostile or puppet schools will not be eligible for registration; (5) Registered currently enrolled students will be sent directly to the temporary university supplementary classes by the Educational Reconstruction and Guidance Committee of each district; (6) After registered currently enrolled students have completed supplementary classes and passed the qualification review, according to the five categories of requirements: (A) Students specializing in supplementary courses who achieve a score of 75 or above in all supplementary courses will be assigned to public or private colleges and universities at their original grade level to continue their studies. Those who wish to take the transfer exam for a higher grade level than their original grade level and are admitted will obtain the academic status of the grade level to which they are admitted; (B) Students specializing in supplementary courses who achieve a score of 60 or above in all supplementary courses may take the transfer exam for a higher grade level than their original grade level or for their original grade level. Those who are admitted will obtain the academic status of the grade level to which they are admitted; (C) Students taking basic courses in addition to supplementary courses who achieve a score of 60 or above in all supplementary and basic courses will be promoted one grade level from their original grade level and assigned to public or private colleges to continue their studies; (D) Students taking basic courses in addition to supplementary courses whose scores in the supplementary courses and basic course qualification review are below 60 in any subject will be assigned to public or private colleges and universities at their original grade level to continue their studies; (E) Students taking basic courses in addition to supplementary courses who fail two or more basic course subjects (will be handled according to the regulations for supplementary courses) will transfer to suitable schools to study. (7) Senior students taking basic courses whose scores in all supplementary and basic courses are 60 or above may submit a reading report on Dr. Sun Yat-sen's legacy (including the Three Principles of the People, The Fundamentals of National Reconstruction, and The General Plan of National Reconstruction), and a report on "China's Destiny" by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, along with a thesis on their specialized subject. The class will then submit the list of names of the students, high school graduation certificates, and transcripts from the original school to the Ministry for review. If approved, the class will issue a certificate. This certificate will be stamped by the Ministry and can be considered equivalent to a graduation certificate from a college or university. (8) Separate measures will be formulated for the Northeast and Taiwan regions. The qualification review measures for graduates have already been published in previous reports and will not be repeated.</p>

<h3 id="e100">Declaration of the Shanghai Music Cooperation Association <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>We—the colleagues of the Shanghai music community—have initiated the organization of the Shanghai Music Association to unite friends in the Shanghai music community and jointly promote the future music movement in Shanghai.</p>
<p>In terms of quantity and quality, Shanghai's musical talent occupies a significant advantage nationwide. Many performers and composers have the opportunity to be nurtured here. There are orchestras, music schools, and all kinds of good material conditions. The world's most outstanding performers, if they pass through China, will perform in Shanghai. This is a zone for the exchange of Chinese and foreign cultures, a breeding ground for the development of Chinese music. It has been so in the past, and it will be so in the future.</p>
<p>However, Shanghai musicians do not seem to have made the contributions they should have, nor have they reached the level of performance they should have. It is not that we individually lack lofty ideals or correct beliefs; every musician possesses these from the beginning of their studies. What are our ideals and beliefs? Simply put, we are willing to use the skills, musical knowledge, and learning we have acquired to enhance human happiness and make life more fulfilling and enriching. We believe that no art is more suitable than music to beautify life and sublimate the human spirit or soul. If we narrow the scope to the standpoint of the nation, we urgently demand the creation of new Chinese music, so that the backward Chinese music can evolve rapidly and stand its ground in the general trend of world music in a short period of time.</p>
<p>However, we are very ashamed that, in the entire Chinese music movement, our performance and our contributions are weak and insignificant. Why? Bringing up this question immediately yields an answer: we have not united our individual forces, we have not combined all our lofty ideals and good beliefs into a vibrant, surging, and courageous force, advancing toward a great goal. In the past, we have been too scattered, too lacking in mutual assistance, too lacking in enthusiasm, so that individual efforts have all fallen flat.</p>
<p>Among all the arts, music is the most collective art. An orchestra is an aggregate of multiple instruments, and harmony is an aggregate of multiple intervals. Only by bringing together all the scattered sounds can music be created, and only by bringing together multiple musical talents can the function of music be brought into play. Therefore, there must be an organization to unite the Shanghai music community and concentrate the scattered forces.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Music Association was born out of this urgent need, and we celebrate its establishment with great enthusiasm.</p>
<p>We would like to briefly mention the direction of future work: First, there is the issue of raising and popularizing what is contended for in literary and artistic theory. We believe that this is just two sides of a complete object; lacking any one side would destroy the integrity of the object. We will simultaneously work to take both aspects into account, so that enhancement and popularization develop in a balanced manner.</p>
<p>We plan to promote singing in Shanghai, so that those who love to sing can unite, organize choirs, and composer friends can write more songs for everyone to sing. From the singing movement will gradually emerge a new Chinese opera.</p>
<p>Secondly, we will have some friends specially engaged in folk song research and recording. Chinese folk songs are extremely rich and varied. On this vast land of China, they are the voice of the people, they represent the soul of the people, and the new music of China will directly grow and flourish based on folk songs.</p>
<p>In terms of learning, we want to establish a music library, so that learners will not have the distress of lacking books.</p>
<p>An orchestra will be quickly established, which can regularly introduce world masterpieces, especially new works by domestic composers.</p>
<p>To describe other details would go beyond the scope of this article. The Shanghai Music Association has been established, and at the same time, we hope that colleagues in the music community across the country will unite, respond to us, and promote new Chinese music with the strength of the entire nation.</p>
<p>A small boat is thus launched into the turbulent sea. We hope that friends all over the world will help us with friendly hands, urge us, and encourage us.</p>

<h3 id="e101">Drastic Price Fluctuations Last Week: Commodity Stocks Rise in Tandem, Urgent Need for Effective Measures <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>Last week, commodity prices in this city experienced another sharp surge, with rice prices exceeding the 40,000 mark, having a significant impact. Although the authorities have closely supervised the situation, it has not been effective in practice. Gold prices have remained relatively stable under the control of the Central Bank of China (CBC), but the U.S. dollar has surged far above its official exchange rate. Chinese and foreign stocks, as well as consolidated bonds, have seen prices rise due to rumors of the reopening of the stock exchange, stimulating investor sentiment. Stockbrokers have seized the opportunity to engage in activities, spreading baseless rumors to drive up prices on the black market for stocks. Government bonds have also reached record highs. Other commodities, such as flour, fried dough sticks, yarn, cotton, sugar, and silk, have all increased in price. If this continues, the future of people's livelihoods is truly unimaginable. The market situation last week is summarized as follows:</p>
<p>Gold</p>
<p>Buyers remained cautious, and short sellers were active. From Monday to Friday, prices fluctuated between 1.56 million and 1.59 million, with a slightly bearish trend. However, on Saturday, the market improved due to the transfer of speculative funds from other sectors. The price rose from 1.575 million to 1.59 million. Although it briefly fell to 1.575 million, it ultimately reached 1.6005 million yuan, exceeding 1.6 million yuan.</p>
<p>Foreign Currencies</p>
<p>The CBC's exchange rate of 2020 remained unchanged, but the U.S. dollar was exceptionally strong. It fluctuated between a low of 2140 and a high of 2380 throughout the week. Because the U.S. dollar could be used for foreign exchange settlements, foreign merchants frequently bought it up, and the supply was limited. Further speculative activity by speculators also contributed to its strong performance, with arbitrage trading becoming common.</p>
<p>Government Bonds</p>
<p>Although the authorities have strictly prohibited speculation in consolidated bonds, speculators still hold onto the rumor of a 120-fold repayment of principal. The government's policy on pre-war national debt has not yet been clearly announced, leading to various speculations in the market. Amidst the speculation, investor sentiment has been high. On the black market, Class C bonds started at 5,700 on Monday, gradually rising. From Tuesday to Thursday, they hovered around 6,100 yuan. On Friday, they jumped from 6,000 yuan to 6,900 yuan. On Saturday, they broke the 7,000 yuan barrier, reaching 7,400 yuan, with a high of 7,600 yuan.</p>
<p>Stocks</p>
<p>Chinese stocks initially strengthened but then weakened. The morning opened with active trading on a next-day delivery basis. Subsequently, as floating profits were taken, the market became volatile and declined. On Tuesday, the market initially continued to rise, but then weakened as large investors exited. Frequent short covering occurred in the afternoon, leading to a recovery. As a result, large stocks were little changed from the previous day, while Qinxing, Jingfu, and Xinguang experienced slight declines. The market remained relatively stable on Wednesday, but uncertainty prevailed, leading to a decline of 100 yuan in two large stocks. On Thursday, under strict regulation, investor sentiment was cautious, and the market was sluggish with limited trading. On Friday, six large investors absorbed the previous week's downward trend. Due to CBC control, prices were strong. With rumors of the imminent reopening of the stock exchange, prices rose uniformly.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks initially experienced ups and downs, but ultimately rose sharply as Jewish merchants vigorously covered short positions. Jardine Matheson and Union Insurance both exceeded the 15,000 yuan mark. On Tuesday, as Jardine Matheson and Union Brewery reached their target prices for bullish foreign companies, retail investors, wary of high prices, began to exit, causing the market to decline after halting its rise. Prices declined by about 100 yuan each, except for Jardine Matheson, which remained unchanged. On Wednesday, trading was suspended under strict government supervision, and the prices quoted off-market were slightly weaker, with trading being slow. On Thursday, constrained by the environment, prices fell further. On Friday, trading was slightly more active in secret, and prices rose in buying. Jardine Matheson, Union Insurance, and Wheelock Marden each increased by 500 yuan. With news of the stock exchange reopening, investor sentiment was optimistic, and prices rose uniformly.</p>
<p>Grains</p>
<p>At the beginning of the week, the rice market saw ample supply but slow trading. Prices remained unchanged except for foreign indica rice, which increased by 500 yuan. The flour market was strong, with Cannon and Warship brands increasing by 500 yuan. The prices of miscellaneous brands rose even more sharply, with Peacock and Train brands increasing by 800 to 1,000 yuan. Due to exports, Pinghu coarse beans rose by approximately 3,000 yuan, with other varieties also rising by 1,000 yuan. In terms of cooking oil, Qingdao barrel raw oil rose by 2,000 yuan, and soybean oil rose by 4,500 yuan. Sugar demand decreased sharply, and prices remained stable, with only Xinghua white sugar rising by 4,000 yuan, while the rest maintained their original prices. On Tuesday, rice prices fell, each variety dropping by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan compared to the previous weekend. The flour market remained strong, with Warship and Chrysanthemum brands continuing to rise by 2,000 yuan. Cooking oil and sugar also rose by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan each due to limited supply and high demand. On Wednesday, the rice market, which was initially weak, became active again, and the market trend became firm. Sugar prices also strengthened, with medium-grade sugar rising by 3,000 yuan. On Thursday, grain, cooking oil, and sugar prices experienced a comprehensive surge. Rice prices rose again by 1,500 yuan due to high prices at the production area. Flour prices quoted off-market rose by thousands of yuan. Soybeans rose by 500 yuan, raw kernels rose by 1,500 yuan, and cooking oil sales were strong, rising by 4,000 to 5,000 yuan. Sugar prices also became firm. On Friday, the rice market was chaotic. Due to the insistence of cargo owners, the market rose sharply, with japonica and indica rice each increasing by approximately 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. The flour market also rose sharply as buyers continued to purchase it, rising by about 10%. Miscellaneous grains also rose sharply. Cooking oil was in short supply and rose by another 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. The sugar market was buoyant, with medium-grade sugar rising by nearly 10,000 yuan due to competition among buyers. On Saturday, the rice market opened flat but then became chaotic. As a result, japonica and indica rice each rose by 10%. The prices of flour quoted off-market were even more chaotic, rising by approximately 2,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Cooking oil also rose sharply, with barrel raw oil closing at 70,000 yuan, and soybean oil rising sharply, reaching 16,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Raw Yarn</p>
<p>In the past week, the market was stagnant due to ample raw yarn inventory in Shanghai and average actual sales to buyers. Later, with the surge in gold and stocks, the environment was favorable for bullish positions. Actual demand from Tianjin and Guangdong increased, and market prices soared. Fengliu No. 6 experienced the strongest increase, reaching a high of 1.77 million yuan for 42-count Blue Phoenix yarn on Saturday and a low of 600,000 yuan for 10-count Tongxin yarn on Monday. In terms of count, 10-count Tongxin yarn rose the most, by 140,000 yuan, followed by 32-count Phoenix yarn, which rose by 115,000 yuan, and 20-count Shuangma yarn, which rose by 100,000 yuan. Other yarns rose by 70,000 to 80,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Fabric Market</p>
<p>The market was initially weak, but then improved along with the stock market and yarn prices. As a result, grey twill rose by 4,000 yuan, while other brands rose by approximately 2,000 to 3,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Cotton Market</p>
<p>Private factories and industry colleagues continued to purchase cotton, and the market trend continued to rise. Miter cotton delivered to factories has reached 92,000 yuan. As a result, the prices of various types of cotton increased by 5,000 to 8,000 yuan compared to the previous week.</p>
<p>Silk</p>
<p>The artificial silk market was very stable at the beginning of the week. From Wednesday, 120-count Tianqiao brand rose by 100,000 yuan. On Friday, it rose by another 100,000 yuan. Compared to Monday, it had risen by 250,000 yuan by the end of the week. The prices of miscellaneous brands remained approximately 100,000 yuan apart from the Tianqiao brand. 75-count semi-gloss yarn rose by 180,000 yuan in a week. The reason for the sharp increase was that buyers purchased it, and non-industry personnel also collected it. Factories were relatively quiet last week. There were no significant fluctuations until Thursday. From Friday, prices suddenly rose. 85-count high-uniformity silk rose by 200,000 yuan in total, 78-count high-uniformity silk rose by 100,000 yuan, ordinary silk rose by 150,000 yuan, and thousand-thread silk rose by 100,000 yuan. The silk fabric market saw strong buying interest from Wednesday, mostly for speculative purposes, leading to a price increase. The price of Meya bedding rose sharply by 200,000 yuan within two days, Wednesday and Thursday. By the end of the week, it had weakened, rising by a total of 200,000 yuan in a week. The price of Dacheng plaid crepe rose by 700 yuan by Friday, but fell back by 100 yuan at the end of the week, rising by a total of slightly less than 600 yuan last week.</p>

<p>The recent surge in grain prices, with white rice exceeding 40,000 yuan, has set an unprecedented record. Concerned authorities recognize the seriousness of the situation and have convened meetings to discuss countermeasures for days. It has been learned that Premier Song met with Minister of Food Xu Kan and Mayor Qian Dajun yesterday morning for a lengthy discussion and decided to take the following emergency measures: (1) immediately consult with the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) to expedite the shipment of large quantities of food purchased from Myanmar and other places to Shanghai; (2) closely monitor illegal activities such as hoarding and speculation, and severely punish unscrupulous merchants who manipulate the market; (3) sell off all the food stored by the enemy and puppet regimes in a short period of time; (4) instruct the Jianghai Customs to "allow only flour transported by UNRRA for relief purposes to be transshipped from Shanghai, and prohibit any other organizations or individuals from transshipping flour for export." It is also learned that Li Du, Chief Secretary of the Jianghai Customs, issued a notice yesterday to ban the transshipment of flour in accordance with the instructions.</p>
<p>According to a senior official in the city's grain administration, the Executive Yuan recently convened relevant grain administration agencies to discuss and request that UNRRA allocate 209,000 tons of relief rice to China and have it shipped to China in August of this year. At the same time, personnel will be sent to Siam and Canada to purchase foreign rice and ship it back to the country to alleviate the food shortage.</p>
<h3 id="e103">Mercury Prices Fall Universally <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 28th] The recent drop in mercury prices on the world market is due to Italian and Spanish producers selling off their inventories. Spain is eager to obtain foreign exchange, especially U.S. dollars. Whether the controlled price of mercury in the United Kingdom will fall as a result remains to be seen. The supply department currently has 10,000 to 12,000 large bottles of mercury, enough for one year of use. The majority of this mercury was purchased at prices higher than the current market price, which may slow down the price decline in the United Kingdom.</p>

Category C and D members of the tobacco exchange industry can withdraw the goods from the association immediately.</p>
<h3 id="e105">Analysis of the Reasons for the Surge in Chinese Stocks <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>Chinese stock trading has been banned from speculation since mid-February, and there is no public trading. However, clandestine activities are still rampant. The rise in prices since the ban reflects the extent to which clandestine activities are fueling speculation. Since last week, the authorities have dispatched police to strictly enforce the ban, making it difficult for speculative investors to operate, resulting in a temporary weakening trend. However, after Finance Minister Yu arrived in Shanghai and made a statement to reporters, generally nervous investors took this as a positive sign and absorbed large quantities of stocks. At the same time, rumors spread that powerful figures in the industry were lobbying the authorities to resume trading. As a result, the upward trend in prices began to emerge on Friday afternoon of last week, and by the weekend, there was a dramatic surge, with the two major stocks and three smaller stocks closing at new high prices. The percentage increase in prices compared to Monday is as follows:</p>
<p>Note: Closing price is based on selling price</p>
<p>According to the table, Shensin Garment accounted for the highest percentage increase at 16%, followed by Meya Silk Factory at 14%. The former was due to its own price increase before the shareholders' meeting in the middle of last week, resulting in a high base. The latter, among the so-called two major stocks, was engineered to create a speculative frenzy by large investors, exceeding the increase of Wing On Textile Factory.</p>
<p>The reason for the rise in Chinese stocks is due to speculative funds, allowing speculative large investors to do as they please, manipulating the market at will. The stimulus of the imminent resumption of the stock exchange further fueled the fire. Generally, it is believed that the resumption of the stock exchange will transform illegal transactions into legal trading, and after the stock exchange is restored, some of the manufacturers' stocks will be approved for listing and circulation. Therefore, in the upward trend, even unpopular stocks are favored by buyers. Chinese stocks are originally investment businesses, but now they have become speculative targets. Since they are speculative targets, it is difficult to correlate price increases with asset standards. The recent sudden surge is considered normal by stock players. At this stage, unless speculative funds are diverted to legitimate channels, the stock market frenzy may continue to be staged. (Dehui)</p>

<p>The government promulgated the Interim Measures for the Administration of Foreign Exchange by the Central Bank on February 25. Subsequently, the bank designated 29 Chinese and foreign banks in the city as designated banks to operate foreign exchange business. Other financial institutions may also apply to be Category A operating firms in accordance with the provisions of the measures. By the end of last month, over 100 banks, money shops, and trust companies in the city had applied to the office to be Category A operating firms. After careful research and setting standards, each application was reviewed several times. The approval was issued by President Bei of the bank. A total of 139 firms were approved. The banks and money shops have been notified to bring the official receipts issued by the bank, signed and sealed by the person in charge, to the Foreign Exchange Examination Office at 15 Zhongshan Road, Section 1, before the end of this month to collect their certificates. In the future, banks and money shops with certificates can operate the buying and selling of foreign currency banknotes in accordance with the regulations and must comply with the Interim Measures for the Administration of Foreign Exchange. Those without certificates have been publicly announced by the Central Bank and will be prohibited from operating the buying and selling of foreign currency banknotes from May 1.</p>

<p>[Reuters, New York, 28th] Although the start of Japanese silk exports has been delayed, officials believe that the target of exporting 130,000 bales this year will be achieved. Recently, two ships carrying approximately 5,000 bales of silk have departed from Japan.</p>
<h3 id="e110">Difficult to Restore Trade in Southeast Asia, Slack Trade Between Shanghai and Hong Kong <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>After the war, trade between Shanghai and Southeast Asia has been extremely limited, far from pre-war levels. According to people in the import and export industry, the main reasons are: (1) transportation is difficult, and cargo is obstructed; (2) since the currency system in Singapore and other places has stabilized, various goods are much cheaper than in Shanghai due to price controls by local governments; (3) the delay in hypothecation often means that the goods have arrived but the bill of lading has not yet arrived, making it impossible to unload the goods and incurring undue losses. Due to the above three reasons, many Southeast Asian merchants are unwilling to place orders in Shanghai. In particular, the third reason causes too much loss. Even export goods transported to Southeast Asia are now mostly exported through Hong Kong. However, trade between Shanghai and Hong Kong is also stagnant. The reasons are as follows: (1) there is only one fixed ship per month between Shanghai and Hong Kong; (2) in the past, the main exports from Shanghai to Hong Kong were textiles, followed by metal materials and medicines. Now that the Jianghai Customs has banned the export of textiles, trade with Guangdong merchants and overseas Chinese merchants has become even more bleak; (3) it takes one month for remittances between Shanghai and Hong Kong, and merchants are limited by funds and the price fluctuations of goods in Shanghai, making it unprofitable to them. Therefore, everyone remains on the sidelines.</p>
<h3 id="e111">Difficult to Export Fujian Native Products, Shipping Costs 80,000 Times Higher Than Before the War <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>[Fuzhou News] Foreign trade here has come to a standstill. Exporters have no way to transport goods to other places for sale because shipping costs are too high, resulting in losses in most cases. It is learned that the current average shipping cost is 80,000 yuan per ton, and private ships require 100,000 yuan, which is 80,000 times higher than the pre-war index. This multiple is only found in the prices of general commodities. Two or three months ago, native products such as bananas, fruits, and timber were popular in the Shanghai market for a while. The official price surged, reaching a peak of 165,000 yuan per ton. In particular, timber sales were strong, and the fee was collected in a disguised form as a "70/30" split, meaning that no shipping fee was collected here, but after the goods were sold in Shanghai, 70% of the proceeds were taken as the shipping fee, and the cargo owner only received 30%. Recently, prices in Shanghai have fallen, and prices here have risen. The wholesale market prices of native products are not far from the Shanghai market situation. Merchants are already feeling the burden of shipping costs. Except for those who must transport goods to Shanghai for sale, others dare not try to make unnecessary losses. Since the opening of the Taiwan Exchange Line, there have been no goods to load from Fujian to Taiwan because the shipping fee of 40,000 yuan per ton is too high. It is expected that under the current rigidity, shipping fees will fall in the near future, otherwise, the service will be discontinued.</p>
<h3 id="e112">International Financial Group's Depository: International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and Monetary Fund Open Accounts with the New York Federal Reserve Bank <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>[United Press, New York, 27th] The New York Federal Reserve Bank has quietly opened accounts for the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the International Monetary Fund under heavy security, creating a new era for international exchange. The first small deposits were not announced, but are estimated to be only in the hundreds of thousands of dollars, and may increase to billions of dollars within a month. The United States alone has an obligation to deposit more than 3 billion dollars in cash and banknotes. The Federal Reserve Bank is a massive grey stone building, surrounded by skyscrapers. Although the headquarters of the International Bank and the International Monetary Fund are located in Washington, the United States has designated the New York Federal Reserve Bank as its fiscal agent and depository, so most of its actual transactions are carried out here. Orders issued by the headquarters are executed by the New York Federal Reserve Bank, with some being transferred to central banks and depositories overseas. The entire procedure is extremely simple and eliminates the need to transport large amounts of gold and silver currency back and forth across the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. According to officials at the Federal Reserve Bank, most member countries of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the International Monetary Fund have opened accounts. If there is a dollar transaction, it only needs to be transferred from one account to another. For example, if France purchases goods in the United States but temporarily lacks foreign exchange to pay, the Monetary Fund can sell 50 million U.S. dollars to the French bank, which will be transferred from the Monetary Fund's account to the French account. If the International Bank approves a long-term loan of 100 million yuan to India for construction, the same procedure can be used. The International Bank has 9.1 billion yuan in funds, and the Monetary Fund has 1.8 billion yuan. Its first board meeting is scheduled to be held in New York on May 6.</p>

<p>In recent weeks, the prices of Western medicines have gradually fallen due to the continuous arrival of goods, especially raw materials such as yellow and white petroleum jelly. Although saccharin has arrived, it has been hoarded by large investors. On the one hand, it is stimulated by the rising price of sugar, so it is rising day by day. In terms of prepared medicines, Ciba has already released the first batch of goods, so the price of that product has dropped significantly. It is said that Quchi Medicine will also release goods next week. If this is true, then the price of that product may also fall.</p>

<p>[Reuters, New York, 28th] According to agricultural sources, the area under rice cultivation in many countries in the Americas this year shows signs of breaking records.

<p>[Tianjin News] Since the victory, only pig bristles have had a relatively large export volume in Tianjin. Before the war, the U.S. pig bristle market was dominated by China. After the war, South American and Indian pig bristle merchants shared the market due to the disruption of transportation. Sea transportation has recently resumed, so the export of Chinese pig bristles will become increasingly active. Recently, Tianjin exporters have offered U.S. merchants pig bristle prices through the intermediation of U.S. trading companies, including $5 (U.S. dollars) and $5.6 per pound. These prices are not higher than U.S. prices.</p>
<h3 id="e116">The Minimum Wage Law: Its Formulation and Key Points <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>— Tian Heqing</p>
<p>Recently, due to the surge of labor movements, all parties have paid close attention to the issue of wages. Among them, the Minimum Wage Law, although not yet implemented, was actually promulgated as early as ten years ago. Now, I will select and introduce its formulation process and key points for reference.</p>
<p>The Minimum Wage Law is a common regulation adopted by various countries around the world when setting wages. In order to encourage universal adoption by its member states, the International Labour Office specifically proposed it as the first item on the agenda for discussion at the 11th Conference held in Geneva on May 30, 1928. It was unanimously passed, and several proposals for minimum wage measures were drafted into an international convention, in accordance with Part XIII of the Treaty of Versailles and similar provisions of other treaties. The draft convention was formulated on June 16, 1928, and sent to the member states of the International Labour Organization for ratification to become a formal convention. The National Government of China ratified it on February 28, 1930. According to the convention, ratification by member states becomes effective twelve months after registration by the Secretary-General of the International Labour Office. Therefore, in order to comply with the obligations of the convention, the National Government entrusted the Legislative Yuan to draft a Minimum Wage Law based on the principles stipulated in the "Convention on the Establishment of Minimum Wage Setting Machinery," and with reference to the minimum wage laws of other countries, consisting of a total of 23 articles. It was formally promulgated by the National Government on December 23, 1936, but to this day, it has not been ordered to be implemented.</p>
<p>The full text of the Minimum Wage Law is too long, so I will summarize the main points as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The most difficult problem in setting wages is how to determine a fair and reasonable wage? How to determine the minimum wage standard? According to Article 3 of the Minimum Wage Law, these most basic and troublesome issues are very clearly defined.</p>
<p>The article states: "The minimum wage rate should be determined based on the local cost of living and the conditions of workers in each industry, according to the following standards:</p>
<p>(1) For adult workers, the standard shall be to maintain their own necessary living expenses and to provide for two dependent relatives without working ability.</p>
<p>(2) The wages of child laborers shall not be lower than half of the adult minimum wage."</p>
<p>According to the above article, the minimum wage rate should be determined based on the local cost of living and the conditions of workers in each industry. The so-called local cost of living can be based on the worker's cost of living index published by the Shanghai Municipal Government every month. As for the conditions of workers in each industry, it usually refers to the technical skills and education level of workers in each industry. What should not be ignored is the position of the industry itself, such as prosperity, the amount of production, the strength of the employer, and international competition. All these issues should be carefully examined before a final decision can be made. In addition, the standard is already very clear in the article. However, one point to be emphasized is that the minimum wage rate is limited to the necessary living expenses for supporting three people, including the worker himself.</p>
<p>(2) The second key point is who will stipulate this minimum wage rate? According to Article 7 of the law:</p>
<p>"When the competent authority considers it necessary to stipulate a minimum wage for all or part of the workers in a certain industry, it shall solicit the opinions of both labor and management in that industry. It may then submit the proposed minimum wage rate to the Minimum Wage Committee for deliberation and approval by the superior competent authority, and then announce it after filing with the Ministry of Industry."</p>
<p>How is the Minimum Wage Committee organized? According to Article 8:</p>
<p>"The Minimum Wage Committee shall consist of nine to fifteen members, organized by the following personnel, whose candidates shall be reported by the competent authority to the superior competent authority and then reported to the Ministry of Industry for record":</p>
<p>1. One or two representatives of the competent authority</p>
<p>2. Three to five representatives from both labor and management</p>
<p>3. One person from both labor and management who has no direct interest and is familiar with the industry</p>
<p>4. One representative may be sent by the Ministry of Industry or the provincial competent authority if deemed necessary</p>
<p>Other matters, such as the board and lodging provided by the factory, may be included in the calculation of wages based on the average value of the most recent three months. Also, the minimum wage rate can only be modified in accordance with the law after being implemented for twelve months. All these are stipulated in detail in the law. It is hoped that the competent authorities and the legitimate organizations of both labor and management will promptly petition the National Government to order the implementation of the law nationwide on a regular basis. This can avoid many unnecessary disputes and save a lot of valuable energy to engage in national construction and production work.</p>
<p>However, there are two very basic and urgent issues that need to be resolved before the Minimum Wage Law can be invoked. The first is how to stipulate the bottom line? The second is to what extent is the cost of living index published by the municipal government accurate? These two issues are worth discussing.</p>

<p>[Reuters, New York, 28th] The House Monetary Committee is making another effort to increase the U.S. gold price from $34 to $56 per ounce. However, the U.S. Treasury Department opposes increasing the U.S. gold price, and it is expected that this measure has very little chance of being discussed in the House.</p>
<h3 id="e118">Tianjin Tea Price <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>Highest Price 9,600 Yuan Per Jin</p>
<p>[Tianjin News] According to tea merchants, a batch of tea recently arrived in Tianjin from Shanghai and was distributed to various tea shops. Although the price was lower than the local price, it needs to be re-roasted after delivery, which causes damage. Therefore, the selling price has to be slightly increased. The current highest price is 9,600 yuan per jin, while the highest price for black tea is 6,400 yuan per jin.</p>

<h3 id="e120">Prospects and Retrospectives of the Silk Industry in Jiangsu and Zhejiang <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>— Shi Cheng</p>
<p>Among China's agricultural exports, silk, tea, and tung oil have always been the main commodities, with silk being particularly important, producing 100,000 dan annually. Jiangsu and Zhejiang account for half of this, with the rest coming from Guangdong, Sichuan, Shandong, and other regions. They are distributed to countries such as the United States, Britain, France, and the South Seas Islands, and have a good reputation in foreign markets.</p>
<p>During the War of Resistance Against Japan, many factories were closed. Although some moved to Shanghai to start production, there were very few. Between 1940 and 1941, the enemy's control was very strict. Even if silk was transported from the factory to foreign firms, it had to go through several checkpoints, and it was difficult to collect cocoons. Manufacturers were overwhelmed and closed down one after another, with only two or three remaining.</p>
<p>With the outbreak of the Pacific War on December 8, exports were completely interrupted, and only a small amount of capital was used for domestic sales. Silk prices plummeted, and cocoon prices followed suit. The countryside was restless, and many villagers were unwilling to raise silkworms and produce seeds. The price of firewood was also very high, so many mulberry trees were cut down for fuel. To this day, only two or three out of ten mulberry trees remain.</p>
<p>China used to have sericulture farms in Hangzhou, Zhenjiang, and Huatingguan, among other places, producing high-quality products that could compete with foreign seeds. But now, they have all disappeared. Therefore, the seed production this year is not abundant. Fortunately, General MacArthur has agreed to allocate 300,000 seeds to China.</p>
<p>According to people in the industry, there are about 70,000 dan of silk in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, which can be exported in no time once maritime transportation is open. The plan to revive the industry is to establish the China Silk Company, which will be operated by the state, with Ge Jingzhong as the general manager, responsible for unified sales. There is also a model factory located in Suzhou. The remaining cocoons are entrusted to various factories to be reeled into silk, and the quantity is considerable. Many people are currently planning to open factories, but one of the most difficult problems is the fuel problem. The black market price of coal is high and difficult to buy. The alternatives are diesel and firewood, but buying firewood for a whole day is almost equal to the amount needed for a day of machine operation. Under such difficult circumstances, the future of the silk industry is dim. However, we should strive with perseverance and work hard to bring glory to the country. Fellow silk industry workers, let us encourage each other.</p>
<p>It takes three to five years for mulberry trees to grow from seedlings, and success cannot be seen without careful cultivation. The government should also vigorously promote and encourage it.</p>
<p>The sericulture schools in various places have been almost completely destroyed by the enemy and puppets. In the future, the government should establish sericulture schools in silk-producing areas such as Wuxi, Jiaxing, Huzhou, Haining, and Zhenjiang to train sericulture talents.</p>
<p>Private silk factories lack capital, and the government should subsidize them according to their silk production performance.</p>
<p>In the future, after Italy and Japan successively surrendered, there will be fewer formidable enemies in the foreign market. However, it is reported that agriculture is still allowed to exist in Japan and can be exported in exchange for needed goods. Since silk is an agricultural product, Japan will inevitably revive its old industry and compete with China in the future. Japan is not yet able to export silk, and China should catch up quickly. The future is unlimited.</p>

<p>— Zhong Zuoqi</p>
<p>One of the Small Industries</p>
<p>Under the slogan of "Production First," most domestic people's attention is focused on all heavy and light industries, while ignoring general small industries.</p>
<p>In fact, small industries are quite important. China has suffered damage from eight years of war, and all industrial equipment and decades of painstaking operation have been completely destroyed. The revival of heavy and light industries after the war is certainly necessary, but it is indeed difficult to start anew today, when the domestic economic situation has not yet reached the pre-war level. Therefore, the development of small industries in the future is worthy of attention and cannot be ignored. I hope everyone can shift their attention to the emerging small industries.</p>
<p>Speaking of small industries, everyone knows that there are various kinds, such as ink, shoe polish, toothpaste, and snow cream. These are the most common small industries, and I will not mention them for the time being. What I want to introduce is various other kinds that have a wide sales market but are not noticed by people. Now, let's introduce the manufacturing method of rubber caps for bottle necks.</p>
<p>We often see something like a cup covering the neck of bottles containing medicine or other beverages. This is a rubber cap for the bottle neck. Its function is to prevent the liquid in the bottle from seeping out and to avoid the disadvantage of the internal liquid deteriorating due to air leakage.</p>
<p>The raw materials for making rubber caps for bottle necks are very simple. You only need the following materials to start manufacturing:</p>
<p>20 parts of old film, 90 parts of ether, 115 parts of alcohol, 1 part of castor oil.</p>
<p>First, soak the old film in hot water to soften it, take it out and use a knife to scrape off the upper layer of medicinal film, cut it into small pieces, and put it into the fully mixed ether, alcohol, and castor oil mixture (the amount is matched according to the ratio mentioned above), and stir it to completely dissolve the film into a semi-fluid gel. If you want to color it, add a certain amount of pigment, such as adding half a part of aniline oxide to make it black, adding two parts of aluminum powder to make it silver, or adding two parts of copper powder to make it gold. Then pour the gel into the prepared mold (the mold is made of glass, shaped like a glass cup, the size of the opening is based on the bottle stopper, the largest opening is 60 mm, and the smallest is 15 mm), let it flow evenly to all parts, and blow it with your mouth. The ether will evaporate first, and the gel will gradually harden. While it is not yet completely dry, take it out and put it on the bottle neck. If you use a completely hardened rubber cap, you can slightly dip alcohol or ether around the bottle neck and press it around with your hand. After the alcohol evaporates, a airtight rubber cap for the bottle neck is made. However, two points need to be paid attention to during manufacturing: First, ether evaporates very easily and has a narcotic effect, so it should not be smelled with the nose, otherwise it will cause fainting; second, ether spreads into the air and will burn or cause an explosion when it meets fire, so avoid fire when manufacturing.</p>
<p>The above manufacturing method is relatively simple. In large-scale industrial manufacturing, many places use machines instead of manpower. For example, it is impossible to use your mouth to dry the medicine liquid on the mold, so you should use an electric fan to replace it.</p>

<p>— Ba Ling</p>
<p>Production construction should be linked to transportation construction in order to achieve smooth material transportation and ultimately achieve the goal of economic recovery.</p>
<p>Currently, the call for production construction is very loud, which is naturally a good phenomenon. However, in my opinion, the importance of transportation construction is no less than that of production construction. Among transportation construction, highway construction is indeed an urgent matter.</p>
<p>Only by intensifying production construction on the one hand and promoting highway construction on the other can the materials produced be exchanged smoothly and quickly to all places, and economic recovery can be actively promoted.</p>
<h3 id="e123">An Introduction to Mutual Commerce Management <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Baiyi</p>
<p>(6) Changes in Purchasing Power</p>
<p>What we are going to discuss now is the reason for the change in purchasing power. Taking the situation in the United States as an example (the situation in China can also be referred to to get an answer), many people know that one dollar can buy less things after World War I than before the war. This is the decline in purchasing power or currency value. We should study the reasons for this decline, because we can know how to look forward to the future and determine the situation in the future. Should we add a factory building or issue company bonds to obtain additional working capital? If we expect that the purchasing power of each dollar will be greater in a few years than it is now, then we should implement a short-term loan. If the purchasing power of each dollar will be lower in a few years than it is now, then it is more cost-effective for us to borrow money and delay repayment.</p>
<p>As for the biggest reason for the decline in the currency system, it can be said that it is due to the increase in the transportation of goods. After the number of bank loans increases, the currency system circulating in the market also increases, so the quantity of goods that each dollar can purchase decreases, and a product that originally only cost ten dollars will rise to one hundred dollars.</p>
<p>When we are running an industrial or commercial business, we sometimes feel that there is insufficient working capital and we need to borrow money from the bank. There are several determining conditions for whether the bank is willing to lend money. The first is to see whether the industrial or commercial business we are running is reliable and how our business policy is. Although the bank can obtain the interest on the loan after lending money, if the industrial or commercial business we are running is not reliable, then there is a risk that the loan cannot be repaid. The second is to see whether the bank itself has a lot of cash. If they do not have a lot of cash, then they cannot lend as much as possible and implement contraction.</p>
<p>Many banks have stipulated the loan limit. They stipulate that a certain percentage of the deposit amount should be used as the loan limit (there are two types of deposits, one is current deposits and the other is time deposits. Time deposits are more suitable for bank lending business because they have a fixed term. Usually, the bank's profit is the difference between the interest charged to the borrowers and the interest paid to the depositors). For example, if a branch receives deposits of 30 million yuan, if they stipulate that 40% should be used for loans, then they can lend 12 million yuan.</p>
<p>In general, the principals of businesses always hope to develop their business quickly, so they constantly borrow money from banks to make up for the lack of their own capital. If they obtain huge loans from the bank, they will add factory buildings and increase production. At that time, it depends on the general situation of the market. If the quantity of goods is overflowing and the supply exceeds the demand, then they will gradually embark on the road of recession. If the quantity of goods is small and the demand exceeds the supply, then the price will rise and the value of the currency system will decline. The prices of goods in recent years have generally been depreciated currency systems, because too many counterfeit coins have been issued, but the prices of goods fluctuate. Any product that is in high demand and has a low supply will rise in price, and any product that is in low demand and has a high supply will not rise in price. Therefore, a management personnel of an industrial or commercial business must grasp their own position and observe the general situation to decide whether they need to expand and manufacture a large number of goods.</p>
<p>In addition to the domestic market, we also need to observe the international market and foreign exchange issues, and pay close attention to the value of the currency system and the value of goods at any time. Regarding the reasons for the change in prices, we can list the following basic situations:</p>
<p>A. The purchasing power of each dollar changes with the following facts:</p>
<p>(1) When the price of goods rises, the purchasing power of each dollar decreases.</p>
<p>(2) When the price of goods falls, the purchasing power of each dollar increases.</p>
<p>B. The rise and fall of prices is affected by the following situations:</p>
<p>(1) The issue of the supply and demand of goods, whether the supply exceeds the demand or the demand exceeds the supply.</p>
<p>(2) The number of currency systems in circulation and their speed of circulation.</p>
