<h3>軍事小組初步協議　聞國軍縮編為九十師　共產黨軍整編廿師</h3>

<p>〔中央社重慶廿一日電〕政治協商會議分組委會國民大會組，及憲法草案組，今日下午三時，在國府開會。施政細領組，同時在國防最高委會開會。惟對各項問題，均未獲協議，尚待各小組繼續協商，故大會明日仍不舉行。</p>
<h3>馬歇爾返渝　續努力調解　來滬任務未發表</h3>
<p>〔本報北平廿一日電〕馬歇爾本定今來平，茲因故展緩。</p>
<p>〔中央社重慶廿一日電〕馬歇爾今日下午二時半自滬抵渝後，除接見使館職員外無其他正式約會。</p>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕據美軍總部報吿，美駐華特使馬歇爾元帥，昨午十一時半離滬返渝，馬氏在滬前後逗留二日，每日之時間，均在會議中度過，渠曾數次與魏德邁將軍，柯克海軍總司令會談，並對於聯合國善後救濟總署之高級官員及在滬有地位之美國商業家有所指示。馬氏以此次來滬，時間短促，公事繁多，未能與記者晤面，至表遺憾，至於馬氏此次來滬之主要任務，則不便發表。</p>
<p>〔聯合社重慶廿一日電〕美國特使馬歇爾赴滬公畢，今日返抵此間，政治觀察家相信馬使將就政治協商會議各小組委員會所未解決之問題，出任調解。同時各小組委員會今日繼續努力解決各問題，尤其是組織國務會議問題。大會定二十三日閉幕，此等問題若不得外界援助，殆鮮有解決之望。記者詢及各方面人士，馬使對於中國之團結，是否再有盡力可能，若輩表示本身一日有解決希望，一日不敢勞煩馬使。但一般人確信馬使對於改編軍隊，將有所盡力。該問題現由張羣，張治中，周恩來三人委員會處理中。</p>
<p>〔中央社徐州廿一日電〕據官方消息，馬歇爾元帥因公延期來徐。</p>
<h3>調處執行部頒令兩軍　命自動突區撤退　完成停戰恐需四個月時間</h3>
<p>〔美新聞處北平廾一日電〕調處執行部今日頒發第二道訓令，命衝突區內之國共軍隊停止開火，並各自衝突地點撤退一整天行程之距離。該項訓令在城市及鄉村方面，均將予以執行，而所撤退之距離，至少爲二十英里，訓令簽字人爲鄭介民（代表國民政府），葉劍英（代表中共），羅濱遜（美國軍事參贊）。前錢指揮官同時奉命在兩軍隔離及戰事中止後，立即恢復一月十三日午夜時之地位。第二道訓令，進一步執行休戰協定，並補充關於投擲傳單及遣送流動戰地視察團之辦法。同時，投擲停戰傳單，今日有大規模進行，在山西·河北·山東·河南及江蘇各省之三十一城鎭方面，其投下二一五。〇〇〇份傳單，其他飛行部隊，將于明日續在三十一城市散下停戰傳單一四五，〇〇〇份及新訓令傳單萬十份。　〔聯合社北平廾一日電〕軍事調處執行部今日宣布：流動調查隊一隊，預定將自上海派往廣州。此爲執行部派出之第七隊。而爲派往江南之第一隊。</p>
<p>〔本報北平廾日電〕今日爲停衝令生效後之第七日，各地之槍砲聲與雙方之吿急電，仍紛至沓來。看風使舵之物價，刻亦步步回漲，黃金且擁破九萬大關，但熟悉政情人士告記者，和平前途仍可樂觀，簽字于停衝命令上之雙方當事人，皆具誠意，第以各地衝突皆爲長期歷史發展之結果，若欲其如團體操然，說停即停，實不可能，但勸解者如走至衝突地點，親手拉勸，亦必可使打成一團之雙方拉開各重要衝突地點，一經停戰，其他小衝突亦可逐漸减少，以至于無。執行部一部人士估計，完成停戰恐需四個月，而樂觀者則判斷有兩月時間足矣，設如重慶之三人小組能有良好之成就，則此時間將更爲縮短。目前出發「勸架」之和平小組，已有集寗·赤峯·張家口·大同·濟南·徐州六組，據新聞組美代表布端田語記者，各組工作相當順利，並無想像中之困難，政府與共軍對彼等招待皆極熱烈，然詳情尙未至發表時期。記者另自他方探悉，赤峯方面除第一架飛機因誤會被當地駐留蘇軍扣留外，近二三日所去飛機，皆獲蘇軍優遲翼協助，此種和平小組，一二日當續有二組出發。執行部除美方人員已到滿一二五人外，政府·共黨人員皆未到齊，政府人員到達近百，共黨僅到三十餘人，因人手不齊關係，刻工作尙未全部展開，而來平人員每日大都工作十餘小時，北京飯店政府之「二一九」·「二〇九」及共黨「一〇八」·「一一八」等房間，俱燈火通宵，其工作之緊張辛苦可知。共黨到達人員不多，但係自渝延滬張等地調集者，據傳頗多第一流人才，此或象徵共方之誠意也。執行部三方人員，相處甚爲融治，每件事情決定，皆取圓桌會議方式，新聞組政府方面負資人季澤普，且矚記者審愼發布新聞，勿刺激共方，足見雙方之融洽與求成功之決心。共方宣傳人員除龔澎小姐外，近又到一人，其人即寫國際論文之喬木（編者按：龔即係喬之夫人）。</p>
<h3>招待小組代表　聶榮臻談和平</h3>
<p>〔聯合社重慶廾日電〕周恩來今日稱：國共停戰令發出七日，各地軍事衝突已息止。</p>
<p>〔合衆社張家口廾日電〕華北五省（包括潘陽營口）共軍總司令聶榮臻，今晚在宴請三人視察團席上宣稱：渠對於北平調處執行部之和平努力，願全力擁護，聶氏旋對新聞記者發表談話稱：「余確信馬歇爾將軍現正爲中國之和平而努力，共產黨贊成和平，需要和平，且希望得到永久之和平」。今日上午聶將軍曾招待視察團美方及國民黨代表，商討在其轄區內執行「停止衝突命令」之問題。</p>

<p>〔中央社太原十九日電〕雁北渾源縣城爲共軍攻陷消息，係長官部十九日晚公布，進攻談地之共軍，由陽高·天鎭·廣靈調來一萬六千餘人，內有日共六百餘，附輕重機槍七八十挺，砲六七門，十五日晚十一時開始攻城，至十六日拂曉，城西南被共軍突破，國軍爲自衛計，經激烈巷戰後，由東門撤出，向北轉進，沿途復受多次伏擊，致傷亡三百八十餘人。</p>
<h3>收復區農貸　廿億元即可發放</h3>
<p>〔本報重慶廿一日電〕政府對於收復區去歲勝利後曾撥四十萬萬元，作爲緊急農貸，分期貸放，第一期已就江蘇，江西，湖南等省，於收復後貸出十萬萬元。第二期亦於本月中旬放出十萬萬元，分發河北，山東，廣東，河南等十餘省收復區，作農民購買耕牛，種子，肥料，農具等經費，其餘廿萬萬元，最近將貸出。</p>
<h3>香港屏山機場　暫停武裝護築</h3>
<p>〔本報廣州廿一日電〕香港新界因港方無理在屏山展立機塲，摧毀該處數十鄕村，經鄕人向全國呼籲，引起國人反對，而新界聯鄕代表鄧松年。鍾少廷復來省聯絡，除已電我最高領袖，並電友邦政要外，我外交特派員郭德華亦據理抗機，港當局已允請示英政府，現屏山機場武裝護築已暫停止。</p>
<h3>貝茲稱美軍將暫留華　促成安定與和平　遣送日軍移交我國辦理</h3>
<p>〔合衆社天津二十一日電〕美衆院海軍分組委員會共和黨委員貝茲，爲派赴華北視察陸戰隊情形之海軍及農務委員會十委員中之一員。該委員團於一月五日自華府首途，歷訪琉球島及日本，茲來華視察靑島之第十睦戰師及天津之第一陸戰師。貝茲稱：「陸戰隊已將日軍遺返工作移交中國政府辦理，但此項在華任務並未完成，當美政府之良好斡旋正被利用以促成中國兩大勢力之和平妥協期間，該陸戰隊將在華留駐一更長之時期，俾作爲一種穩定軍力。我人企求世界之永久和平，我人確信苟不假以臂助，則另一世界爭鬥或正在醞釀中」。</p>
<p>〔聯合社天津廿一日電〕美衆院海軍委員會委員貝茲今日宣稱：委員會所注意者有四大問題，（一）處分海軍剩餘物資，（二）視察太平洋海軍設備，（三）軍隊復員，（四）太平洋佔領區或收復區內之一般情形。美軍留駐中國時間，將視中國建設保障世界和平，防止未來戰爭之政府能如何合作而定。</p>
<h3>承德赤峯蘇軍即撤退　東北工礦未談妥　具體問題及細節猶待商討</h3>
<p>〔本報北平升日電〕權威方面消息：承德赤峯蘇軍，定今日撤退國軍已開至附近地帶，準備自蘇軍手中接收防務。營口係國軍自蘇軍手中接收之港口，日前被共軍攻陷，該地區現况如何，及新六軍巳吾在葫蘆島登陸，權威方面未加說明。長春瀋陽兩地蘇軍，已作撤退準備，但防務雙方尙未正式交接。前長春消息謂廾日蘇軍自長撤退之說，尙屬言之過早。我抵達瀋陽國軍，今後可依的利用長春鐵路北運長哈等地接防。二月一日蘇軍的東北撤盡之期，可望不再展緩。熊主任原定今日返平，因該地事務未畢，已展期返平。於蘇軍撤退東北之前夕，蔣夫人蒞臨東北國門，以國家元首夫人之資格，慰勞並送別解放東北功成身退之蘇軍將士。安東接收尙無佳音，該處非不能接收，而係接收有困難。且蘇軍亦莫能爲力。工礦問題，蔣經國在莫斯科可能與蘇方成立若干原則，若干具體問題及細節，猶待在長春商定。據悉：斷斷續續之中蘇工礦談商，已達數月之久，其間且一度涉及輕工業，但最近談判則以重工業爲限（記者按：以上係行營負責人對本報記者談話，但不願發表其姓名）。</p>
<p>〔中央社錦州廿一日電〕周至柔廿一日午，乘機來錦，視察空軍基地，並會晤熊杜兩氏，轉達中樞之重要指示，即日原機返平。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕本埠某外交家昨日透露，魏道明氏回國之後，重慶政界盛傳駐美大使將由顧維鈞繼任，顧氏所失駐英大使一職之人選，業已成爲討論中心。郭泰祺氏前任該職多年，與英國朝野感情極爲融洽，目前正在重慶鄕間閑住，頗有膺選可能。</p>
<h3>開封緊張已過去　晋北共軍攻陷渾源縣城</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿一日電〕徐州電話，豫北民團萬餘，在封邱東北兩面作戰甚力，二日內開對市民之緊張情緒已成過去。軍警爲嚴防宵小，準備甚力，戒嚴時問已提早，開封至鄭州，開封至新鄉火車如常開行，人心尙安。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿一日電〕徐州電話，竄擾豫北封邱之共軍，十九日爲當地團隊阻遏於距離開封六十華里之周村，廿日晨又增援南犯，現正與豫北民團激戰中。又活動於隴海東段沿綫之共軍，頃爲策應豫北共軍之攻勢，已將開封·徐州間黃口站至李村站長約三十餘里之軌道拆去，蘭封附近路軌亦被破壞，汴徐段交通，自日本投降後，為共軍破壞大小達八十三次，忠勇絕倫之路工，仍在拼命搶修中。</p>
<h3>偽律師會計師　一律取消資格</h3>
<p>並檢舉附逆有據者</p>
<p>〔本報南京廾一日電〕重慶訊：行政院與各法院，爲嚴防附逆有據犯有重大罪嫌之自由職業者，如律師，會計師，醫師，新聞記者等，化名混入各機關避匿，就中如僞律師，偽會計師，且有易地執行業務，欺騙人民者，正根據各種調查，嚴訂檢舉辦法，以儆奸逆。聞凡向僞政府登記領有憑證之僞律師，偽會計師，一律取消其資格。</p>
<h3>台灣近况</h3>
<p>— 曾今可</p>
<p>日本無條件投降兩星期後，台灣總都府因爲事實上已經瞞不住了，才不得已廣播宣布。台灣差不多每家人家都有收音機的設備（戰前記者在東京的時候，普通的收音機只賣三元日幣，只合我國二元四角）。所以這個好消息立刻傳遍了全台，歡聲雷動，臨時用紙製成的靑天白日滿地紅國旗，到處飄揚。起初，因爲還沒有正式投降，日本軍民居然老羞成怒，禁止慶祝和集會遊行，有些地方的國旗也竟被日本警察撕毀了。但幾天之後—日本軍民知道「皇軍」業已瓦解，侵略的好夢醒了，不但准許台民盡情歡狂地慶祝，而且空前地，不折不扣地和台民實行「親善」了！而且希望甚至哀求台民的「提携」了！雖然那時候距正式投降的日子還是很遠。</p>
<p>也因爲我們去受降太遲了，在台灣現在就發生了一些本來可以避免的損失與糾紛。當我們被派去接收台灣軍政的大員遲之又久方到台灣的時候，不但是橫添了許多難以克服的困難。而且因此之故，直到現在還不能完成接收的任務。這任務的眞正完成，以記者個人觀察來判斷，恐怕至少在半年之後才有可能：</p>
<p>第一，日本軍民在已投未降的將近兩月的漫長時間裏面，肆意向台民挑撥離間，說他們「奉天皇之命解放台灣，都要解甲歸田，今後台民本可自由；但中國即將派兵來征服合灣，所以台民今後將做中國的奴隸」。台灣淪敵達五十年之久，台民五十年來與祖國隔絕，對於日本軍民的這種臨去秋波自然是將信將疑的。日軍又紛紛將輕便武器廉價售與台民，故意種下禍根。其居心的險毒，實堪痛恨！</p>
<p>第二，我們的接收人員一到台灣的時候，事實上已經不能以迅雷不及掩耳的手法去接收軍事，自然也無法即行接收政治。加以台民不懂國語和國文，接收人員又大多數不懂台語及日語，因難自然更多。</p>
<p>第三，進駐台北的國軍和憲兵裏面，據說有些人的行爲給合民以不良的印象，因而予日本軍民以破壞合胞與祖國的感情的口實，因而有日台浪人合組的暗殺團發現，因而軍政接收人員兩方都有人失踪。</p>
<p>台灣行政長官陳公俠將軍，是治台最適當的人選；以他過去治閩的政績，可以保證他將來治台的成功。記者敢說：今日的台灣，除了陳長官之外，沒有誰能治。自然，今日的台灣，除了陳長官之外，不然更沒有誰能够治得好。上面所說的那幾種困難，除了是無法克服但已過去的以外，我相信，陳長官一定會逐漸設法克服的。但以記者個人的管見，治台者似應先注意下列數點：</p>
<p>一·軍事完全接收之後，首先應設法遣送二十餘萬名的日軍回國，再行設法遺送卅餘萬名的日本僑民回國。</p>
<p>二·遺送日本軍民回國之後，立即嚴密調查登記民間的武器，設法或給價將這些武器集中管理。</p>
<p>三·妥擬治台計劃，萬勿使合民有今不如昔之感。</p>
<p>四·愼選治台幹部，萬勿使台民有天下老鴉一般黑之歎。</p>
<p>五·完全不用日本職員，萬勿使台民及日入有治台非用日人不可之譏。</p>
<p>如能確實迅速地辦到遺幾點，則不但台灣易治，而且一定可以治好，否則將無從去治。陳長官日前在擴大紀念週報吿他的施政綱要說：　「在積極方面，要做到（一）教育與服務機會平等；（二）建立眞正的民意機構；（三）提高人民生活水準。在消極方面，要做到（一）整理財政，减免苛征；（二）重新釐訂法令規章，（三）保障人民合法權利。」</p>
<p>這當然可算是一種賢明的政策，但如果不先把我前面所貢獻的幾點管見做到，則這種賢明的政策似乎也不易實現。</p>
<p>此外，就記者所知的台灣近况，堪以奉吿國人者，尙有下列數點：</p>
<p>（一）台灣與福州及廈門，相距都很近，隔日可達。可惜到現在還沒有正式通航，商民來往，都是乘坐帆船，一遇大風，便很危險。最近一月間，翻沉帆船，時有所聞。昨晚又得商界電信，有三艘帆船從基隆載貨來福州，才離開基隆不遠，即因風向不利，收帆不及，三隻船都翻沉了。希望招商局能够早點設法開辦合灣與各地的航運才好。</p>
<p>（二）台灣人才頗多，記者所認識的台胞，大多歡是受過高等敎育的，以學習自然科學的居多數。如果運用得當，這些人才都是建設新台灣的優良幹部。因爲合灣在日本統治之下達五十年之久，學社會科學的人危險性較大，所以學的很少。但社會科學方面的人才我國各省都很多，將來台總所需要的人才可以和各省交換。</p>
<p>（三）台灣靑年能懂國語的固然絕少，就是能完全懂台語的也很少，所學所用都是日語日文。這是五十年奴化敎育的結果，原不足怪。因此，陳長官計劃在四年之內，要使台灣的靑年都懂國語。縱然不容易普遍，但也決不是一件絕對辦不到的事，只要眞能努力從事，四年的時間也不算短。</p>
<p>（四）台灣蕃族都有民族觀念，日本統治了台灣五十年，他們始終沒有歸附。台灣光復後，他們就派代表鹿毛等拜訪陳長官，表示願意移居平原，願與台胞同化。並且還預備組織訪問團訪問首都，拜謁中山陸，覲見元首。</p>
<p>（五）台灣現在還是用台幣，台幣和法幣的比率也還沒有確定，大約與關金相等。商人都是由福州載貨到台灣去賣，賣了再買貨回來，一往一返，如果沒有意外的損失，一元可變成五元。雖然航海危險，來往的人還是很多。最近，陳長官下令，金和糖都不許出口。但商人神通廣大，到台灣去以貨易貨的還是很多。</p>
<p>（六）合灣報紙原有多種，以「台灣日日新聞」行銷最廣。「台灣日日新聞」現已由我方接收，改組爲「新生報」，仍有一版用日文排印（和戰前日人在上海所辦的「上海日日新聞」相似）以幫助台胞暸解時事。「興南新報」現改爲「民報」。正式黨報則尙未有。陳長官表示，台灣應該有一種黨報，將來或由中央宣傳部派人主辦，或由台灣省黨部主辦。</p>
<p>（七）台人李友邦畢業於黃埔軍官學校第一期，自民國十五年以來即任台灣省黨部特派員，抗戰後組織台灣義勇總隊，由軍事委員會派其任總隊長。記者昨得其來書，云即日由厦門渡台，聞共將出任三民主義靑年團台灣支團部幹事長。　十二月十七日寄</p>

<h3>與左派閣員起爭執　載高樂突告亂職　三黨將組聯合政府</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據倫敦廿一日廣播：法國臨時總統戴高樂星期日突然亂職，法國政府定明日召開緊急會議，選舉新臨時總統，以代替戴高樂。（戴高樂略歷參看第三版）</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕據巴黎廿一日廣播稱：法國三大政黨，即共黨·社會主養黨與天主教黨，以往雖有悠久之爭端，但令晚已有三黨成立聯合政府之希集。據法外長畢都爾語記者稱，「我人不久將成立三黨聯合政府。」</p>
<p>〔聯合社巴黎二十日電〕法國臨時總統戴高樂之秘書巴羅斯基今日宣布：戴高樂總統因軍費問題，與內閣左派閣員發生爭執，業已辭職。內閣討論此事歷四小時之久，共產黨及社會黨堅欲再削減陸軍預算百分之二十，陸長密希萊不允，戴高樂支持陸長，並因國際局勢關係，亦不允核减，現在辭意堅決，乃莫可挽回之事。</p>
<p>〔合衆社巴黎二十一日電〕自戴高樂將軍於星期日職後，法國陷入無政府首長之政治混亂狀態。共產黨乃於今晚要求推舉該黨領袖陶雷士繼任法國總統，共黨秘書長杜克洛與人民共和黨及社會黨領袖數度會談後稱，共產然要求取得新聯合政府之領袖地位。共產黨為法國最大政黨，但如無另一大黨聯合組織政府，其力量實嫌太弱。</p>
<p>〔路透社巴黎二十一日電〕高樂將軍辭政府首長職後，議會中實力最堅强之共產黨，似將發動迅速解決危機之步驟。共產黨領袖陶雷士當於今日與進步天主敎黨及社會黨磋商，以組織三黨聯合政府，由陶氏自任首長，如不幸而失敗，急進黨當參加社會黨—共產黨之聯合陣綫，然則首長一席，或當　諸急進黨領神前任總理之赫里歐氏。消息靈通方面謂戴高樂將軍定於今晚離巴黎，渠原定今晚廣播，已予作罷。</p>
<h3>聯合國各委員會　本週內召開　原子能委會成立</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據倫敦二十一日廣播：聯合國全體大會之强有力的政治安全委負會，今日一致通過關於成立原子能委員會之建議。此項建議係於上月由三强外長會議所提供，贊成通過之票數達四十六票之多，而並無投反對票者，其中僅菲列濱拒絕投票。該委會將包括安全理事會各代表團，加上加拿大。</p>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦二十日電〕聯合國大會各國代表發表演說已六日，於伊朗向安全理事會申請調解對蘇糾紛後，卽砰然一聲宣告結束。此後聯合國機構將認眞處理棘手問題。舉凡原子能管理委員會之設立，難民問題及託管問題之處理，其次議案正由主管委員會草擬中，各大國代表對於伊朗問題雖曾加以討論，但年俸二萬五千美元之聯合國機構秘書長八選，亦須在會外接洽，加以確定，本星期內大會每日至少有六個委員會開會，大會本身並擬於星期四舉行非常會議一次。安全理事會在本星期中應當開會，經濟及社會理事會則已定於星期三舉行首次會議。此外，歐洲方面新會員加入聯合國機構問題，亦可望早日在大會中提出討論。英國今日在會員資格審查委員會中宣布，歐洲方面新會員應准其加入者，已有十三國，法國贊同英國主張及早加以核准。蘇聯一俟西歐方面新會員資格核准後，亦將申請准許波羅的海各國入會。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦二十一日電〕聯合國大會本星期之議程，當以原子能之管制，列入首要地位。原子能委員會之報吿，屆時可向大會提出，諸小國至此始獲對於此一恐怖能力發表意見之機會，聯合國大會今已轉入實際問題之討論，故蘇聯正副外長莫洛托夫及維辛斯基之缺席，實不無影響。維辛斯基行踪不明，昨日悉其可於當日抵達倫敦，結果仍未見來臨，蘇聯對於伊朗之將亞塞爾拜然事件正式提請安全理事會調查，顯然極度關切。印度首席代表莫達利亞可望當選爲主席，託治委員會亦將於本週初開會，然託治理事會之正式產生，或當待諸本年四月召開大會之後，根據憲章規定，託治理事會須俟託治地準備受其治理時，始能實際產生。英相艾德禮或當於本週英議院復會時，再度闡述託治問題。</p>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦二十日電〕聯合國大會土耳其代表團新聞處主任伊爾狄昨日宣稱：，蘇聯若依據喬治亞敎授兩人建議，要求土耳其割讓阿門尼亞蘇維埃附近黑海領土一萬二千五百方哩，土耳其將與以反抗。土耳其現尙未向聯合國機構提出任何難題，惟將來如有涉及聯合國憲章之問題發生，必將在此機構內覓取總決方法。</p>
<p>〔合衆社倫敦二十一日電〕聯合國安全理事會主席澳洲代表梅金，對於該會將如何及何時考慮伊朗所請求之調查蘇聯干預伊朗內政問題一事，希望能於今日獲得決定。渠並不希望召集該會之非常會議，但擬將此一問題於下次例會中提出討論。</p>
<h3>對蘇談判失敗　伊總理亂職</h3>
<p>伊蘇或將再開談判</p>
<p>〔聯合社伊朗京城廾一日電〕伊朗總理哈基米昨夜宣佈與蘇聯談判亞塞爾拜然省事件失敗後，即行辭職。哈基米之辭職，上屋期即可逆料，當時渠向國會宣稱：政府外交政策失敗，對蘇聯談判之努力，無濟於事，擬將伊蘇糾紛提出聯合國機構。據哈基米今日談稱：「余已奏明國王，將伊朗案件提出聯合國大會，現準備下野」。</p>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦廾一日電〕聯合國大會伊朗代表今日談稱，伊朗總理哈基米辭職後，伊朗與蘇聯或可直接進行談判，解決雙方糾紛。</p>
<p>〔路透社德國關二十一日電〕伊朗郵電部長兼德國關市長那里曼，昨夜向總理哈基米亂去部長職，此乃哈基米內閣於匝月內之第四次變動。</p>
<h3>希臘民衆　反帝制示威</h3>
<p>〔合衆社雅典二十日電〕民主國體同盟今日在此間舉行民衆大會，到會民衆三十萬人，此為希監艦來所有最大之示威運動。當時希臘領袖聲稱，喬治王返歸雅與之唯一意義即爲革命，並對外國干涉加以非難，謂其辱及希臘人之自尊心。該民衆大會通過決議三點：第一，要求民主黨派聯合反對帝制。第二，要求　清陸軍·警察及政府機構中一切反動及葵斯林派份子。第三，要求組織民主聯合政府，准許人民反抗運動參與其間。</p>

<h3>美全國鋼鐵業昨午起　開始空前大罷工　參加人數在一百六十萬以上　美整個生產力將受嚴重影響</h3>
<p>〔聯合社美國畢資堡廿一日電〕鋼鐵業工人七十五萬人為要求提高工資，於今日午夜起（上海時間下午一時）開始罷工。美國罷工工人總數因此達一百六十萬人以上，造成空前紀錄。三十三州內有工廠一千三百家悉告停閉。鋼鐵廠主及鋼鐵工人現方開始作最後爭鬥，工潮何時可以結束，無人願加揣測，罷工以前，各工廠工作情形巳見遲緩，少數工廠且在未在式宣佈罷工前，即已完全停頓。美國工業組織聯合會主席兼鋼鐵公會會長茂萊巳赴華盛頓，親自領導要求增加工资。茂萊對罷工情形未有表示，但彼計劃於今夜向全國廣播。民營生產局局長斯摩爾準備命令各民用及軍用工廠不許再有優先購用鋼鐵之權，預料將有多數工廠在兩星期內因鋼鐵缺乏而相繼停工。又據華盛頓消息，三十州內發生罷工之肉類包裝工廠，有歸政府管理可能。</p>
<p>〔路透社紐約二十一日電〕華盛頓來訊傳政府現正考慮於本週接掌肉類，庶民間肉食不致中斷。如鋼鐵工潮至下週仍無解決之象，則政府届時或將接收各鋼鐵廠。迄今日淸晨止，並無發生紛擾消息。惟就現象觀之，公司與工會對於何方派人入廠維持一點，諒將有所爭執。今無論工會公司與政府方面均不抱工潮不日可獲解決之希望。此次工潮對美國經濟之妨碍殊巨，估計整個生產力之百分之四十將受罷工影響。美國罷工工人數至此已增為一百六十五萬七千人，此外造船工人四十萬人，或亦將於週杪罷工。</p>

<p>短評</p>
<h3>載高樂突然亂職</h3>
<p>巴黎傳來的電訊，說法國臨時大總統戴高樂將軍，因與內閣左翼閣員，為法國軍備問題，突然提出亂職，且亂意極為堅決。電訊所傳，語焉不詳，然法國一般政治意向，認為戴高樂將軍此次之亂職，將不再復任；此項消息之傳來，雖近突然，却亦並非完全出乎意料之外。蓋自第四共和國政府成立以來，法國共產黨即思顧覆混合政體，以圖擴慶其勢力，原早有壓迫戴高樂辭職之企圖，在第四共和國政府下所進行的第一屆選舉，却不曾給予左翼政團，包括共產黨在內，以絕對的多數；却由三個政黨為主共同成立混合政府，這三個得票最多的政黨就是共產黨，社會黨及人民共和黨，人民共和黨以天主教的力量為骨幹，與共產黨在政見上有根本的岐異，社會黨於是舉足重輕。這次法國的政變，便是由於社會黨與共產黨的勾結；此後法國政局將如何演變，雖不可預測，但此項政變的演成，無疑地是法國左翼政團的抬頭；然而我們却不可忽略另一事實，即代表法國利益的人民共和黨依然是第四共和國下的一股主力。</p>
<p>戴高樂將軍爲法國的努力，在法國的歷史上應永垂不朽。雖然有人批評他爲剛愎自用，以致在國際關係上引起許多不愉快的事件—包括最近在中國發生的白爾丁事件在內，然其希望爲法國爭取過去之光榮的努力，應博得一般世人的稱讚；其所享國內及國際聲譽之隆，實無一法人足以比擬，此次辭職，雖有辭意堅決的表示，然據美聯社巴黎電訊，若干方面認爲在八日之內，局勢或不致如此，自亦不爲無因。法蘭西第三共和國在其五十八年的壽命中，曾有一百另八次政變，平均每年有三次，我們希望第四法蘭西共和國的政治能够穩定下來，此與歐洲局勢及世界和平所關實在匪輕。</p>
<h3>杜魯門總統咨文國會　報告外交與內政　將運用全力支持聯合國機構　充分利用機會扶植經濟擴展</h3>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓二十一電〕社魯門總統二十一日（美國時間，東方時間爲二十二日）向國會提出「國情」狀况諮文，其中切言美國責當協助聯合國機構完成世界協力與恒久和平，並警吿美國人民切弗因遇龐大之商業前途與機會，而忽視其嚴重之戰後問題。諮文使聯合國機構成功之任務、大部份寄諸美國。諮文內稱：「吾人在勝利之基礎上，能建立恒久之和平，使國內與全世界人類得更大之自由與安全。余此次決定以向例的國情諮文與每年預算需文合併提出，而預算中不獨包括國會已授准予進行各項工作之估訂數，即余建議宣行各項工作之估計數，亦列舉在內。現代政府應扶植經濟擴展與保障充分利用機會之責任日益重大，故須就整個國家經濟狀况，以制定政府之程序。本年開始時美國已堅强有力，深具信心，吾人解決各項問題，適應種種機緣，已有龐大成就之紀錄。茲者吾人具有不可勝計之便利，如廣博之天然資源，巨大之工廠等設備，勝人之技術與管理技能，幹練有爲之公民等是。以言最近將來，商業展望一般的極爲一有利，竟至有吾人嚴重的戰後問題，或遭忽視之虞。是以吾人今須以遠大目光與穩健步伐行進，處處顧及失誤，而不爲繁榮之前瞻所誘，致忘却現代事務之基本繁雜性。世界人民有欲成吾人之一部份者我國向爲彼等得獲重大機會之地，茲者我國且成對世界全體人民負有互大責任之地，吾人必須毅然承認並應付此等責任。科學交通與運輸之進步，已促使世界成爲一家，世界家庭每一國之經濟與政治康健，均與每一其他國家之經濟與政治康健，有直接影響。幾世紀來之進化，已使吾人進入世界史上之新紀元，而各國間之相互關係，必須以複雜新途徑發展之。現方成立之聯合國機構實爲最低限度之基本開端而已，務須迅速發展之。例如經濟協力，今亦當與政治安全措置，同樣的審愼綜合處理，各國集合參加全體大會與安全理事會等，固屬要舉，然此猶有未足，欲求安全除進行商議與妥治之外，更應發展聯合國機構，使成世界一體之代表。吾人達入國際新紀元，實有許多新責任，我政府人民之聲個力量與智　，均應集中供獻於國際行動云。</p>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓廿一日專電〕美總統今日向國會致送咨文，述及美國一般計劃及預算，並檢討其外交與內政政策。杜魯門打破其分別致送國情咨文及預算咨文之慣例，而合為一文，並同時提出預算以適應其外交及內政計劃。咨文中之大部爲外交問題，杜魯門重申其於去年十月二十七日美軍海軍節演說中所提之外交政策十二點，據謂，美國外交政策之遠大而顯著之目標，在建立並保持公正之和平。吾人對遠東之基本政策，在鼓勵建立强大獨立統一民主之中國，此乃美國之傳統政策。總統旋指陳美國之且標在及早恢復朝鮮主權，並建立由朝鮮人民自由選擇之政府。總統在其遠東外交政策聲明中，曾檢討美國在雅爾達彼茨坦及莫斯科會議所居之地位，渠特別强調美國參與各次國際會議及機構，以求世界安全繁榮之重要性，並重申美國繼續全力又持聯合國組織，乃其外交政策之一部份。渠保證美國將運用其全部力量，支持並發展聯合國組織，俾能防止國際戰爭。美國之對外經濟政策，在促進其本身之繁榮，並協助世界市塲之恢復與發展，俾對世界和平及安全有所貢獻。美國將保證從事受戰事破壞地區之救濟協助其建設與發展，並與世界貿易之擴展。渠並提出警吿謂，對外經濟政策之順利實施，實賴由國內政策以維持充分生產與就業，並强調美國之嚴重不景氣，足以破壞全世界之經濟結構，若干觀察家認為今日之咨文，係未來充分就業法案所將規定之每年國家收入預算先驅。</p>

<h3>美科學家發明　治瘧新藥　效力勝過奎寗</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓二十日電〕美國科學家報吿：已發明一綜合新藥，用以治療瘧疾，其效力較阿太勃林或奎寗為優，此藥名稱為SN7618，據瘧疾研究合作委員會稱，以此治療急性瘧疾，其見效之速，三倍於上述兩藥，且不必按日服用，而可以按週服用，以使病减輕。此藥不如阿太勃林之沾染皮膚，亦不如奎寗之易致耳鳴，且不致令人胃口作噁，他二藥則容或不免。同時據科學發表另一新藥，確有治俞迥歸性瘧疾之望，此種瘧疾回國軍人患者頗多。惟兩種新藥尚未能供給民衆應用，後一種尤未脫初期實驗，故尙無特定名稱。全世界患瘧疾者每年不下三萬萬人，美國戰時曾以五百萬元供研究之用，經試騐過一萬四千種化合物，以期發明　藥。獄囚及待反對論者，多自願染病治療以供實驗，海燕，鷄，鴨，猴，犬，鼠，兎之用於實騐室中者不下數十萬頭。第一種新樂曾用以治療瘧疾病人五千名，內有軍人一千餘名，頗著成效，但非續經試驗，尚不能供普通平民之用。此藥所以命名SN7618，因其在四年研究計劃中，經七六一八次試騐方始成功，其製法係令阿太勃林分子之一部份與另一化學品聯合而成。據科學家宣布，在同一化學族中，尙有六種新藥，似較阿太勃林爲優，惟是否優於SN7618，現尙不知。</p>

<h3>突告退出法蘭西政界　戴高樂往何處去</h3>
<p>— 本報資料室特稿</p>
<p>全法國的人民和聯合國的人民方面都正在萬目睽睽地矚望著法政府主席戴高樂將軍的時候，突然傳來了一個令人驚惶的消息，說是他已經堅決亂職了！</p>
<p>此番他的辭職上有好多原因的，關於這點，本報已有分析，刊第二版，這里似無贅述的必要，本文的目的，只在迥溯其過去，並展望其未來，但我們目先認爲自一九四〇六月法蘭西對德休戰以來，戴高樂將軍即不辭勞瘁地奔走於倫敦，北非及巴黎領導自由法蘭西而奮鬥。</p>
<h3>法人期待戴高樂　為祖國工作</h3>
<p>戴高樂將軍在過去所完成的還不能算得什麼，而現在正有着他所要做的事，同時法國也正有着無限重要的工作等待着戴高樂去做。他將是唯一最適於勝任再造法蘭西之工作的領導者，所以人們正等待着他運用巨大的力量去再造法蘭西。這種舉國一致甚至舉世一致對他信任的再造工作，正需要魄力，智能和信念，而戴高樂將軍被認爲確實具備這些優秀的條件與資望。他在法藺西的资望，可用一句话描摹盡致：戴高樂將軍是法國整部編年史裏面的一個罕見的天才，是重行結合法國渙散了的民心民氣與民力之組織者。他是民主自由法蘭西之强大的軌木。</p>
<p>這次戴高樂總統突然辭職了，法蘭西這輛列車不致於因此出軌嗎？這是世人引為驚惶的唯一根據之所在。</p>
<h3>法國第一位元首　是小兵出身</h3>
<p>戴高樂將軍是五年來法國第一位被民衆選任的元首，其所受的苦痛與磨折，本不易輕易罄述，其最近半年的經歷，也已經不是常人所能忍受。你說他忍耐心不足，也未嘗不可，但他畢竟是忍受了過來，戰鬥了過來的。他的辭職，並不是像某些新聞上所說的退出政治舞台那樣的簡單或消極，而有其退一步進兩步之發展前途，這是極可能的。</p>
<p>將軍名沙爾，除了沙爾這一個「教名」以外，尙有安德萊，約瑟夫，馬禮三個名字，以一八九〇年十一月二日生於法國之里爾省，推算起來，今年該是五十六歲了。</p>
<p>在幼年時代，他就以酷愛工作與勤修學業而出人頭地。後來進聖西爾軍官學校，在小兵的行伍中出身，終於顯出其崢嶸的頭角。</p>
<p>到了一九一四年八月二日，戴高樂將軍被編入步兵第三十三國第一營，這時他已授中尉職。他在這最初的戰役中，顯出了最大的勇氣，受了傷不算，病愈即重上前綫，第二師見其如此英勇善戰，便以這下列的字句來予以獎勵，文云：「戴高樂曾經多次在危險條件之下，實行偵察敵軍陣地，並獲得了許多珍貴的情報。」其爲上峯所器重，有如是者。此後又參加第一次歐戰時有名的凡爾登戰役，歷著功勳。</p>
<h3>前綫上擲來飛彈　等候它開花</h3>
<p>在此時期，我們再舉一個例，以顯示戴高樂的風格，有一天，他與兩個戰友一同担任視察任務之際，一枚擲彈器擲來了一枚飛彈，他們都明晰地望見了飛彈在頭上飛來，那兩位中尉都躺下去了，他却立著等候它開花。等到烟霧散了之後，他便向他們說了這簡單的一句話：「悠受了點兒小驚嚇，先生們？」這個故事，說明了他是如何地富於英勇，鎭靜，沉摯，友愛的精神。至於他在對德戰爭中的功績，更是衆口爍金。</p>
<p>法國自一九四〇年以來，內政，外交，軍事，各方面均這到空前嚴重的危機，經過了一度短期的混亂，經歷了相當重大的損害，可是不久之後，在戴高樂將軍的領導之下，法國民族解放運動便大大地展開，處處顯示出復生的氣象和團結的力量。</p>
<h3>法國會對戴會議　氣勢趨激烈</h3>
<p>過去六月來，戴高樂總統忍受了法國會之醫議，且氣勢日趨激烈。數週前因國防經費問題，戴氏曾一度以辭職相威脅，當時社會黨與共產黨均謂法國耗於軍隊者過多，堅主應予裁减，至元旦商得妥洽辦法，即政府若不在二月十五日以前提出陸軍改編之議案，則彼等所要求的裁减經費百分之二十，應於二月二十入日自動實行。關於糧食問題，政府施策亦在制需會議中遭各方苛烈的責難。關於政府方面，共產黨佔一百四十七席，乃會議中殺大政黨，社會黨佔一百三十八席，進步天主教黨佔一百三十五席，急進社會黨佔二十六席，緩進黨及右翼各黨共佔七十六席，戴高樂政府以這主要的三黨爲基礎，主張不僅由內閣負集體責任，且各部長應獲各黨派之支持，然事與願違，戴高樂在此環境下，卒吿辭職。</p>
<h3>穿上新政服服裝　將再度登台</h3>
<p>但在事實上，戴高樂將軍，身爲臨時政府總統，又獲得了全國選民之付託與信任，只要能在戴高樂的領導下，法國人民及政黨再進一步加强其團結，增進其勇氣，在目前一切內戰業已消失，社會騷動竭力避免的條件之下，法國經濟復興的日子，當已在望，然而，可惜的是，法國三大政黨在普選之中獲得了勝利，在上台之後，却已這到了失敗。戴高樂的辭職，與他個人之得失並無多大關係，與法國人民的關係却是巨大的，戴高樂將軍知道得很明白，他決不會使祖國的人民失望。雖其辭意之堅法，爲不可挽回之事，但短期之內，或仍有東山再起之前途。戴高樂將軍，將穿上另一件新政府的服裝而出現，使我們無驚惶失望之餘地。</p>
<h3>孫會員科向九次協產會　闡述五五憲草　分析其原則精神及內容綦詳</h3>
<p>第四，外界對於憲草中所規定五權行使的辦法，常有一種誤會，許多人誤會十幾年來的國民政府的五院組織，就是將來的五院</p>
<p>五院制度</p>
<p>現在的五院制，是訓政時期的五院制，立法院的立法原則，則由國民黨中央法定，交立法院則訂法律，現在立法院沒有創制法律之權。所有建議，亦要由中央核定後，方能完成立法程序。行政院亦復如是，其重要政策都要由中央核定。現在的五院，除了司法院獨立，中央不干涉裁判以外，各院的重要事務，都要經中央核定，所以現在的政府，是一權制度。國民大會以後的五院，與現在的情形大不相同，各院的權力都比現在要充實，將來的立法院，是最高立法機關，除了國民大會創制法律外，無論什麼法案，立法院都可創制，這樣的立法院，實無異於英美的議會。</p>
<p>總統職權</p>
<p>第五，關於國家具體問題，現在憲草所規定的總統，有兩個資格：一是國家元首，對外代表中華民國；一是行政首長，將來行政院的院長及各部會長，都對總統負責。總統有直接指揮行政之權，美國的部長都是對總統負責，不是對議會成選民負責。現在憲草規定總統對國民大會負責，等於總統制。有人批評憲草的總統權太大了，不過我們看憲草總統一節規定，總統職權都「依法」行使，法律所授予總統的權，總統才有權行使。一般人反對最烈的，是憲草四十四條所規定總統發布緊急命令之權，其實總統發布緊急命令，須得行政會議之決議，並須提交立法院追認。所謂總統權力過大，這一點或可加以研究，其他總統的權力，都是有權限的。</p>
<p>地方制度</p>
<p>第六，憲草中對於省制，當時並沒有很好規定，這幾年來，我們也感到省級規定，需要補充，憲草起草時，中央正注重中央集權，把地方的權逐漸集中，在憲草中，沒有規定省有甚公權，中央給他做什麼事，就做甚麼事，這制度推行至今，連財政權也集中在中央，預算成爲中央預算的一部份。此在抗戰中，是有他的理由的，確也收到相當効果，使中央在戰時財政負擔得了。今後和平建國，我們覺得應該改正。國父遺教中，也明白規定省長民選，但憲草中，無此規定，去年憲政實施協進會，研究結果，大家都覺得這個制度應該變更，省的地位要從新規定，一方面代表國家執行國家法令，同時省也是一個地方自治體，有其本身的事務，恢復去理想中國家與地方的均權制度。此外尙有二點：</p>
<p>（一）憲草中沒有提到軍事，也沒有提到財政，周恩來先生說選舉制度，在憲法內也應有原則規定，立法院起草時，軍事、財政、本有專章，審查時認爲這是一種政策，要因事因地來變更，如果憲法硬性規定兵役國防制度變更時，便須修改憲法，故未列入。</p>
<p>人民自由</p>
<p>（二）一般研究憲法的，都說人民之權利與義務，這一實中規定的人民自由，都有一句「非依法律不得限制之」主張，應取消這幾個字規定的自由，在平是原是無條件保障的，蓋如對外發生戰事時，人民自由是否有限制，英國最講自由，但一九四〇年，法國快崩潰時，邱吉爾組織聯合政府，向國會提出一個要求國會通過授權徵調人力，徵謂物資，資本主義國家對財產保障，是很重要者，在戰時就不能不暫是放棄。許多國家憲法裏，雖無條件保障，但下戒嚴令時，可以對憲法某幾條暫時停止效力，世界各國旣有此例，中國行憲時，是否採用由總統之令停止某幾條憲法效力的方式呢？我們認爲憲法是根本大法，停止憲法某幾條效力，動搖國民對憲法尊嚴的心理，怎樣才能避免停止條文效力，而使政府有權應付事實需要，政府不必須有法律根據，所謂法律有兩種方式：一種是國民大會制定，一種是立法院制定，而立法院是對國民大會負實的。</p>
<p>總之，五五憲章也許還有許多疑問和缺點，這在國民黨方面並不認爲這草案是天經地義，不可修改，所希望的，就是中華民國憲法，要根據三民主義的最高原則，推行五權制度，一方面保障人民行使政權，一方國使政府有能執行國家政務。至於國民大會的產生，組織，大總統的職權，五院組織的方式，及其運用，那是技術問題，可以從長研討、補充、修正。（續完）</p>
<h3>法國民主主義者　戴高樂將軍</h3>
<p>法國普選結果，證明了國人對戴高樂將軍及臨時政府政策之擁護。無疑的人們已承認了他是民意的代表。這次普選可算是法國公民對戴高樂將軍的信任投票，也是對臨時政府的國策的批准。</p>
<p>戴高樂將軍給婦女以參政權，並讓法國將來的組織由大衆決定，這已證明了他完全相信民主主義。當立憲會議工作吿成，第四共和國正式宣吿成立的時候，法國政治方面會更進一步，那和戴高樂將軍的名字會有密切的關係。</p>
<p>這一切的結果是戲高樂將軍證明了自己是法國民主主美者。（臨）</p>
<h3>一個老百姓的公道話</h3>
<p>— 徐慕達</p>
<p>主筆先生：我况在奉上一篇文字，希望貴報發表。我須請先生注意兩件事情：（一）我民國民黨及政府都沒有關係，我是純粹出於客觀的研究。（二）我寫這種文字，沒爲任何私人的目的。我只是覺得我們普通老百姓的意志受那些喧爭自私者的壓迫，莫甚於今日了！我每天看了政治協商會裏有些似是而非的言論，我的血都不免湧上來了！不知這，</p>
<p>先生能够給我一個發表自由言論的樣會嗎？徐慕達　上。一月二十日</p>
<p>（讀者意見）現有的國民大會代表不應當取消的理由，最近孫哲生陳立夫諸先生都有過明白的解釋了。不過他們的解釋，還是偏重在法理方面，並且他們因爲站在政府和國民黨員的立塲，發言都非常溫和含蘊。我現在站在非政府非國民黨的平民立塲，從事實的觀點，把國大代表不應富重選的理由作一番透澈的討論。</p>
<p>那些主張重選的人們，不論在政治協商會內或會外，所持的理由大概不出四種：</p>
<p>他們的第一種理由，也許是最大的理由，就是說現有的國民代表係民國二十五六年所選，選出來之後已經八年有餘，時間是太久了。這種說法，似乎是從法理的觀點來說的，有許多人也許覺得很動聰。孫張二先生已經說明這些代表是制憲的代表而不是行憲的代表，只有任務而沒有任期，所以政府沒有理由去解除他們的合法地位。這也是從法理上來回答的。我們且另外從事實上想一想：誠然，國大代表本應當選出不久就執行制憲的任務，不應當延遲執行達八年之久的，但試問他們為什麼不執行任務呢？顯然因爲代表剛剛選出，中國就遭了日本的大舉侵犯，所以二十六年十一月預定召開的國民大會遂在八年中都不能够召關。然則代表們不能執行任務，不是由於他們自己的過失，而是由於日寇的侵略。日寇侵略的最大目的，本來就是破壤我們的建國，所以國民政府定下抗戰建國同時進行的國策，就是要使日寇破壞我們建國的目的至少不能够完全達到。抗戰勝利，國民政府立即決定在本年五月五日召開國民大會以制定憲法，實施憲政，也就是要使建國早一日完成，復興早一日開始，庶幾證明日寇當初侵略的最大目的已完全失敗。所以凡是願意我民族早日完成建國大業的人，凡是願意日寇侵略目的完全失敗的人，就應當積極來贊助國民大會趕快召開，而萬不能消極來阻撓國民大會的召開。如果說是要求憲政，而同時藉口國民代表選出的時間太長，來阻撓國大的召開，那就是要使實施憲政拖延得更長，也就是要使我們的建國工作開始得更晚，那就決不是我們國民的意志，毋寗說是執行日寇當初侵略時的意志！因爲國大代表重選，至少要費時半年至一年之久，那麼又不能見到今年五月以後中個憲法的頒布，這不是故意和中國憲政開玩笑，而讓老百姓在「多黨劇政」之下再度些喘息的日子嗎？</p>
<p>主張重選的第二種理由，是說代表選出八年有餘，其間許多事實的變化使這些代表不足以為國民代表。他們所謂事實的變化約有四種：（一）國內有許多新的政黨政派興起，（二）代表中有死亡興附逆的，（三）抗戰期中有許多有功的人不是代表，（四）有許多靑年達到了選舉的年齡，他們都不是代表。這許多事實的理由，其實也是一個都不能成立的。就新的政黨政派來說，政府已有顧全事實的辦法，預備增加代表名額以為補救，要算挺選就的了。即使沒有這種辦法，試問爲什麼有了新黨新派就推翻旣成的選舉？難道少數人的黨派應該支配全國的選舉，而合法主政的國民政府所辦的選舉倒可無效？再就死亡及附逆的代表來說，這自然不會成為問題，因為有少數人失了代表的資格，自然要設法去增補，誰也不能說大多數的代表都已死亡與附逆。再就抗戰有功者是不是代表一層來說，更不能成爲理由。當初選舉代表，本是以制定憲法爲目的，並不是以表揚軍功爲目的。况且什麼人是抗戰有功的份子？第一當然是盡忠效命的軍人。但是這些明理的軍人在中國是最守本分的，他們對於國家盡力最大，而對於政治是最爲退讓的，傳作義將軍就是一個代表！這些高呼民主的人難道企圖鼓動「軍主」，全用軍人來制憲麼？除了軍人而外，那些在後方紛呶不休八年，到今天還在那裹爭論不已的議員式的文人政客，難道也都可以老了面皮自算抗戰有功嗎？至就靑年的長成來說，也是不成間題。因爲國民大會通過憲法之後，照政府預定的辦法，就要開始第二屆國民代表的選舉，這就是靑年入選的良機。而我們不能說有了新長成的靑年就要推翻舊選出的代表。總而言之，所有那些用事實變化爲理由而主張重選的，都沒有足以證明全部代表應作爲無效的理由。</p>
<p>主張重選的第三種理由，是說當初的選舉辦理得不好。然則要問，所謂不好指的是什麼？如果是說當初的選舉遠法，那麼推翻選舉要舉出事實的證據來，依法控訴。如果所謂不好只是說當初的選舉不够盡美盡善，那麼怎樣才可算盡美盡善？平心而論，我們本來是沒有民權基礎的國家，我們即使最近將來的選舉，恐也未必能盡美盡善。其實就是民權先通的國家，也難說選舉已辦得盡美盡善。但是廿五廿六年費時年餘所完成的選舉，沒有什麼大疵大弊，絕不是軍閱時代的選舉可比，如果有人隨便用不好兩個字就要推翻這個合法旣成的選舉，那就是想用一個沒有法理根據的行動，去推翻一件有法律根據的事實，用少數人的主張，推翻多數人的意志，不民主的事情莫逾於此！况且我們如果說當初的選舉不好，則試問我們現在能有更美更善的選舉嗎？我們經歷了八年的抗戰，全國大半或受兵災，或遭淪陷，或被黨派割據，或被匪徒蹂躪，所以今日或民不聊生，或秩序混亂，或民衆失去目由的意志，這都是不利於選舉的條件。我們姑且把一切法理的問題拋開不講，試問對此種種不利於選舉的條件，我們能够否認嗎？如果不能否認，而偏要倡言重行選舉，硬指從前的選舉不好，這是不是存心胡鬧？</p>
<p>主張重選的第四種理由，是說現有的代表當中，國民黨太佔優勢。道一個理由，許多人沒有說出來，其實，却是他們心目中很重要的理由。如果僅照政府的辦法增加代表的名額，在那些反對派想來，恐怕國民黨的優勢還是可以保持，這也就是他們還要堅持重選的眞正理由。我旣非國民黨員，而且與國民黨及政府都沒有實際的關係，我只是一個很少發言機會的平民。但是我平心想一想：如果國民黨在國民大會中能佔優勢，又有什麼對國家不好？我有兩個理由盼望國民黨佔優勢：（一）我相信只有國民黨才能够眞誠的擁護三民主義及五權憲法。遠次國民大會的職務是制定憲法，這個職務對於中華民國的前途關係是極大的。如果國民黨在大會中佔優勢，那麼將來的憲法必可以符合三民主義五權憲法。國民政府所頒布的憲法草案，我認爲至少沒有達背三民主義及五權憲法。而別的黨派，不論他們怎樣說國民黨不實行三民主義，我絕不相信他們這些黨派是眞能遵奉三民主義。如果他們遵奉三民主義，他們自然早會加入國民黨，不去遵奉另外的主義，組織另外的黨派了。口頭上，他們也說不反對三民主義，或甚且願爲三民主義而奮鬥，事實上，他們反對國民政府的憲法草案，意思就在反對國父孫先生的民權主義及五權憲法。這是無可否認的。我旣是贊成三民主義五權憲法，我自然擁護國民黨的多數。我不能相信捨了三民主義五權憲法，我們還能定出什麼更好的憲法。所以我認爲國民黨佔不佔多數，關係中國的前途很大。（二）我贊助國民黨的另一個理由，是因爲國民黨有執政二十年的歷史。由訓政走到憲政，本不是說一定要把國家的政治從國民黨的手裹奪來轉交到他黨他派的手。憲政時期，人民要選那一黨，還須人民自己作主。單就制定憲法來說，除了應以三民主義及五權憲法的原理爲根據之外、還要以實際肩負政治的經驗爲根據。創建民國，打倒軍閥，奠定統一，領導抗戰，這些重大工作不都是國民黨領導作的嗎？我不能想像到了制定憲法實施憲政以完成革命建國的大業的時候，一定要把責任交與一些政治經騐比較欠缺的黨派，更不能想像人民一定要交給一些慣於搗亂的黨派。反對國民黨的人儘可以舉出許多國民黨的不好，但是那些反對的人，恐怕連國民黨的一點能力也沒有！如果有，他們年紀也不小了，何以他們從前沒有對國家像國民黨的有所貢獻？政治協商開過七八次的會已把那些號稱黨派的空疏無能完全暴露出來了！如果把制定憲法，這樣重大的責任完全交給這些人，那個結果眞是可怕極了。</p>
<p>根據以上的批評，就知道我們不但應當消極的反對那重選國民大會代表的主張，而且應當積極的贊助這首次的國民大會如期召開。如期召開的好處有三種：（一）憲政早一日實施，政治早一日安定，復興建設早一日開始。（二）合法的選舉能够維持，不被推翻，可以增加國人對於選舉的重視，並且提高國人遵守法紀的觀念。（三）减少各黨各派紛擾的機會，使根據三民主義五權憲法的精義而議定的憲法可以確立爲中華民國永久生存所繫的根本大法。</p>
<p>也有許多自命是持平公正的人，抱了一種息事寗人的態度，以爲何妨重選一下以平息黨爭。這種所謂持平公正的態度，就是鄕愿的和事老態度，最不應當有的。如果有重選的理由，就應富重選，如果沒有，就絕不能重選。選舉是何等大事，絕不能爲了少數人的喧爭就硬呌多數人的意志屈服！所以我這篇文字也就是站在多數選舉人的立一塲上，普通老百姓的立場上，對那些以暄爭來威脅國人的少數派的抗議。我深信老百姓的意志能够伸張，才是我們憲政成功的主要條件。</p>

<h3>國民大會應如期召開</h3>
<p>政治協商會議召開以來，大體上均能在和諧的氛圍下進行。現在對於當前的若干重要問題，雖尙未成立協議，然會議的進行如能始終在協調的空氣下展開，已足慰人民喁喁之望，在歷次會議中，據報傳消息，以關於國民大會及憲法草案的討論最爲熱烈；而且據說各方意見的距離亦較遠。無論對此兩問題的各方意見如何，此兩問題之會有熱烈的討論，足見各方對此問題之關注。就性質上來說，國民大會代表國民全體爲中國制定百年大計的憲法；憲草又爲我們立國的基本法典，關係民權與國家的政治體制者，實至重要。各方之就此兩問題作熱烈的討論，也是可引以爲慰。不過關於此兩問題，雖有政協諸公各自說明了他們的立塲，發揮了他們的高論，但這兩問題關係中國人民前途的利益至爲重大，我們站在報人地位，也應就人民的立塲有所論列。</p>
<p>關於國民大會的問題，其實是一個不成問題的問題。中國國民黨以革命完遂了中國的統一，經過一個時期的訓政，最後決定還政於民，實施憲政之治，於民國二十五年五月公布國民大會代表選舉法，旋即付諸實施。乃不意次年即有蘆溝橋事變，引起全面抗戰。國民大會之召開，遂以此項不可抗拒之原因而延期。現在抗戰結束，政府即定今年五月五日召開國民大會。則此國民大會一經召開，制定憲法，即可實施憲政，大家旣盼望民主政治，對此原不應發生什麼間題。今各方對此，乃有異議，綜其理由，約有數端：（一）一部分國大代表非經民選，而係由政府指派：（二）國民黨當然出席代表人數太多（三）十年前所選舉之代表未必能代表今日之民意等等。此外，還有關於國民大會之性質問題，也有若干人主張於制憲之外，應該行憲。我們倘就此等問題，作一縝密的研討，便覺得這些爭論的無謂；察其用意，無非欲使一個本不成爲問題的問題轉趨複雜，故意阻碍政府還政於民的實現，延長目前的政制，而爲各黨各派分割政權開一方便之門而已。此實非我全民之福！</p>
<p>在關於國民大會的討論上，我們須注意一宗事實，即政府於二十五年五月所公布的國民大會代表選舉法，及依據此法而產生之代表不能取消，否認其爲有效。這些代表雖產生於十年以前，但他們之未能及早履行他們的任務，不是由於政府的拖延，或他們本身的放棄，乃是因不可抗的外患與戰爭，今戰爭勝利結束，我們絕對不能否認他們為有效。這於法，於理，於情，俱爲不可能之事。至於說國民黨當然代表太多的話，我們不可否認一宗事實，截至現在爲止，中國是在國民黨的執政下，由中國國民黨的領導而得到中國的統一，得到抗戰的勝利，而國民大會的召開，又由國民黨執政的政府主辦，國民黨當然代表人數的較多，原亦爲應有之事。且國民黨當然代表在大會代表總數中所占的百分比並不過高，加以政府有意擴大代表人數，網羅各黨各派參加，則此點當更不足深病。再就一部份代表未經民選而由政府指派一點來說，原亦由於不可抗之局勢。譬如一部分經政府指派之代表，大概屬於東北方面，當時東北在日寇控制下，選舉實在無法進行，故不得不有此權宜之法。今日寇在東北的統治雖已崩潰，然各地局勢尙未明朗，經政府指派之東北代表，旣係來自東北，當不難明瞭東北人民一般的意向，代表東北人民行使任務。故關於國民大會的代表問題，應該不視爲一種問題而被討論着的。　　在道以外，我們還聽見有人主張將這個所謂國民大會的代表問題，提付民意測騐。道說起來好像是一句極漂亮的話，但實施起來，亦有問題。中國的幅員這麼遼闊，交通通訊的工具那麼簡陋，民問的知識水準又那麼低落，我們將何從測騐民意？民意測騐將依據什麼標準？凡此，都心些似乎不大負責的論調。如果就民意測騐而言，我們就代表人民，至少一部分人民，說民意測驗的不可盡靠，尤宜是在今日的局勢下。因此，我們敢說：國民大會的代表應繼續有效，絕不因時間的不同而失去共代表性。　　倫效的「紀事報，據路透社電訊，於本月二十日刊載關於國民大會一文，會說：「若干有經騐的觀察家雖同意中國共產黨的主張，認爲國民大會代表的產生，歷時過久，當不足以代表一般政治意向；但他們又認爲若於此際重行選舉，不特將使國民大會的召開有經久的延擱，對於民族的統一亦將有所影響，實爲一極不可付諸實施之事。此誠極中肯的論斷，足供我們三思。</p>
<p>至於關於國民大會的性質問題，那亦是一個多餘的問題。國民大會組織法，對此是有規定，原不應被提出而成爲一個問題。制憲與行憲是兩件事。現在我們還沒有憲法，就須要國民大會來制定，而制定的憲法，何時行使，乃另一問題，所以這次國民大會的召開在制憲而不在行憲，其理亦屬甚明。國民大會經召開制定憲法以後，政府自即應實施憲政之治，再依憲法定期召開國民大會，還政於民。必如此，我們纔走上民主政治之路。今天政協諸公集議於陪都，切莫自己認爲在變法維新，更莫以爲在進行不流血或準備流血的政治革命，乃是在公認在國民黨的領導下，在服膺一民主義爲建國的最高原則下，就國民黨所建立的政治體制，對當前的若干政治問題，作開誠布公約協商，圖謀於商討之餘，選要作進一步的協調。對於國民大會，本不應成爲一個問題。中國人民在經了長期抗戰之後，所望的是安定的秩序。在安定秩序的努力上，中國人民要求國民大會的如期召開，俾得早日實施憲政之治，中國眞正走上民主政治的道路。至於實施憲政後，我們所要的是怎樣一種政治體制，那又是另一問題。</p>

<h3>出版業招待報界　反對鉛印業漲價　影響社會及文化發展</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市書業同業公會整理委員，昨日下午三時，在杏花樓招待本市各報記者。到本市出版業代表及記者八十餘人，該委員會代表上海出版業商務·正中·中華·大東·開明·世界·兒童·生活等六十二家，對此次鉛印業公會漲價百分之百，提出抗議。並擬呈請市府要求制止。</p>
<p>首由兒意書局經理張一渠，及商務印書館代表李柏嘉，報吿鉛印業漲價之不合理。繼由作家書店經理張蓬子，痛述鉛印業漲價對於文化界之影饗，並謂鉛印業之主要成本並未漲價，僅工人生活費有所提高，然事實上工人工資所得仍極有限，鉛印業當局不應利用工人增資名義而漲價。</p>
<p>正中書局經理葉溯中，並以重慶之印刷情形此較，謂重慶排工印工與此處十二月底略同，然其他各物及書籍均較滬價爲高，如此處鉛印費漲價百倍，即重慶之排印工較此低一倍，與情理亦有不合之處。印刷主要原料爲油墨，以戰前相比，油墨價現為戰前之八百倍，然出版原料爲紙張，現紙張價較戰前高八千倍。而書價僅高六百倍。如今各物跌價，獨印刷業大漲特漲。如此情形，勢必造成各出版界停業，其影響整個社會，與文化發展，關係極大。</p>
<p>又出版界戰時屢遭浩刧，遷入內地者不斷遭敵機轟炸，每次燒毀殆盡，桂林之役，又使文化界損失奇重。幸得此次勝利，勉强復員，以期爲文化建設工作而努力，現印刷界首先即予以致命打擊，此無異於毀滅中國文化之復興，故特呼籲輿論界協助制裁。</p>

<h3>投機家存戒心　金價開始回瀉　美鈔港票亦下跌</h3>
<p>宋院長來滬，召集銀行界會談，投機家不無戒心，大戶一再脫金購股，在無稽謠言下，跟風散多隨波逐浪，忍痛了結，午刻最爲疲怯，後市現貨交易較少，隔日交割因北帮購買，勢清穩定，查晨開尙見平穩，證券帮大戶脫金換股，賣氣頓感，開後自九三萬二遂漸降至九一萬二，而後略轉盤旋，無如永紗美亞越　越好，金市相形見絀，持有者意興蘭珊，紛紛跟隨大戶做手，此後籌碼更見鬆濫，勢難支持，終於打破九〇萬大關，午刻竟步降至八九萬以下，午後北帮來購隔日交割，屢見小漲，惟登券帮購中續在拉抬永紗，拋出期金，穩而多盤，結果較之上週六回挫三萬七，飾金九萬六，紋銀七百五，銀元在四七〇元左右，廢曆歲尾頗多實銷，暗拆約一角至一角二分。</p>
<p>美鈔仍難越過一五大關，隨金市而下降，上塲一四九〇元，此際對黃金套價六二五元，引起套買活動，是以美鈔雖不脫盤跌，但較之金市尙形生色，午刻在一四五〇元左右徘徊，套頭活動下，套價已見軋攏至六一〇元對十兩，午後極爲平龐，在一四五五元左右掙扎，結果較上週六回跌三十三元，港票老貨因廣幫套賣而跌十二元，新票散多恐慌，紛紛了結，供過於求，下跌五元。</p>
<h3>證券帮北帮拉抬下　永紗步步上漲　游資雙集中股市　中紡亦衆矢之的</h3>
<p>華股大戶復來拉提，金市游資紛紛歸來，冠蓋雲集，宋院長蒞滬，金市物資多方恐慌萬分，投機活動遂集中於股市，永妙得天獨厚，證券帮及北帮巨頭肆意拉抬，散戶循道而來，籌碼更見涸竭，惟因廣帮一度傾售，中途在一六〇〇元左右曾起盤旋，但買戶勢似潮湧，午刻永紗終以高價結束，美亞走勢較軟，高峯未能持久，三小熱次之，冷門小股更難跟上，中紡紗廠漸有實力派垂靑，自五百餘猛升至六五〇元左右，傳說一股升四股，並發息一百元，目前除永紗外，中紡獲利不在少數，底價又極便宜，一經買戶發動，游資爭先搶購，午收較上週六計永紗狂漲一百六，信和四十元，美亞一百二，三小熱各漲三元至六元半不等，景福新光且將軋平，午後大戶續施做手，永紗一七八〇元，美亞一一三〇元有成交，但不廣泛。</p>
<p>外股風聲鶴唳，業中人都不公開掛牌，買戶受華股助力，異常興奮，形勢十分穩健，午收較週六計怡紗等熱門漲起半成至一成不等，冷門及橡皮股則少出入。</p>
<h3>債市冷談</h3>
<p>公債大戶活動，稍見牽制，散戶見高思危，是以初開時丙稱尙站住週六收價左右，多方紛紛了結，趨往股市，供過於求下，遂破一六大關，退至一五七〇元，後以客帮趁低吸納，一度哄抬至一七一〇元，無如雜牌倍形冷落，環境壓迫下，午刻重又退至一五八〇元，午收在一六三〇元盤旋，結果較上週六計甲乙跌一五〇元，丙九十元，丁一六〇元，戊一五〇元。</p>
<h3>絲綢趨勢緩和　人絲機單傾跌十萬</h3>
<p>農曆年關將屆，銀根漸呈緊逼，昨市人造絲市塲，賣多於買，似遂緩和，一二〇天橋開盤一百三十五萬元，降至一百卅萬元收盤，下午略抬高，喊一百三十二萬元，成交甚稀，極單交易不免投機，昨市跌十萬元，，一百〇三萬元開盤，中途做一百萬元，下午九十三萬有人賣出，但乏受戶，嚴經存貨無多，採辦者尙絡續不絕，價頗堅穩，綢貨大都疲軟，美亞被面每百條七十五萬元，大誠格璧縐每碼二千三百五十元，民生織錦緞仍站週六原盤，每件價一萬一千元。</p>
<h3>紗市賣氣濃厚　棉花交易平庸</h3>
<p>昨日紗市益形不支，自開盤至收市，完全爲賣氣所籠罩，緣紡建公司售價又開低二三萬，同時客銷轉滯，價乃一蹶不振，計各支約均跌三萬之譜，人心淡泊，趨勢亦乏生氣。</p>
<p>現棉，因到貨凋零，廠家與花號略有問訊，曾做開大豐美種細絨花八萬元，鷄脚棉六萬二千元，通州花六萬八千元，餘姚花五萬元，火機花八萬元，南路太會八萬元，（以上均司馬秤一担計算。）</p>
<h3>小子煤銷路暢</h3>
<p>煤市大批交易淸淡，零星交易極爲暢達，行情尙少起仆，白煤中以小子煤銷路較爲活躍，白煤篩塊及煤屑均仍呆平烟煤，塊繼續暢銷，但以實貨流出頗少，市况最熱，柴炭到船尙續，最近零星小販續增，均抱薄利多賣，在年節關內，居家用戶需用較殷，銷路極爲暢連。</p>
<h3>糧價續漲</h3>
<p>粳秈均出一萬大關</p>
<p>米情產地步升，店淸轉股，再見高翔，白粳加三四百元，羊客秈再加四五百元，糯米亦續升二三百元，麵粉南洋略動，北洋問津，本街動而不旺，價再漲百餘元，油市忽上忽落，豆油貨稀，加千餘元，生油僅帶升二三百元，黃豆胄呆，續小一二百元，芝蔴相仿，生仁下游，豆餅平庸，酒銷仍暢，再漲五百元。</p>
<h3>木材堅挺</h3>
<p>昨木材市面，堅穩挺秀，因受一般市面上漲之故，賣方亦步亦趨，各貨平均皆漲，聞杭木由杭州方面陸續運來，現每兩尙售四萬七千元，又本市小型三夾板廠現有小型白楊夾板應市，售每方尺七十五元云。</p>
<h3>茶葉內銷旺盛</h3>
<p>紅緣茶花色，國外貿易目前雖猶停頓，國內走銷，自路綫開通以來，天津·廣東·靑島·江北等地，交易頗爲熙攘，價格方面，在賣買扳抬下，亦步趨堅化，且尤以綠茶脫手益爲順利，是以悄利氣象再度演出，目前形勢甚爲鞏固，行情恐仍有佳境。</p>
<h3>客帮搜羅棉布</h3>
<p>布市平穩，零星交易仍有做開，淺色貨、藍布、襯衫府綢、及士林等貨，川帮、漢口帮、長沙帮趁低尙在收進，至本廠線呢低檔貨，福建幫頻有納胃，本市天津廠家產品旣蒙靑睞，遂略見盤高，粗貨男色綫呢亦在此例。</p>

<h3>國立中央研究院　戰事事業之發展　添設數學醫藥等三所　動植物研究分設兩所</h3>
<p>〔本報南京訊〕國立中央研究院，爲復員工作，前已派該院動物研究所所長王仲濟來京接收京方總院，並有其他各員接收上海方面之院所。（戰前該院物理·化學·工程·三研究所，均設在上海，此後醫藥研究所，視情形有移滬之可能）。查該院在戰前設有物理·化學·工程·天文·氣象·地質·歷史·語言·社會學·心理學·動植物等研究所，計十所，在抗戰期間至勝利時，研究事業進展，已擴充研究所為十四所，除原來動植物研究為一所者，現已分開為動特研究與植物研究各一所，新興事業，為數學研究，與醫藥研究，及體質人類研究共三所。此三所雖尚在籌備之中，而實際研究工作，業已進行。該院南京房舍，因勝利後所查對文物保管會之文物，尚未啓封，（京總院在雞鳴一號）後面屋舍尚未能盡量應用，大部份儀器標準及研究用品，亦尚在大後方，大約於署假前，在渝之總院，可完全復員來京。現在研究院院長仍為朱聊光部長兼，其總幹事一職，為　本棟君担任。</p>
<h3>敵偽教科書　教部嚴厲取締</h3>
<p>〔本市訊〕蔣主席近以敵僞奴化敎育，貽害靑年甚鉅，特手諭各主管單位及各省市首長，務須厘訂具體辦法實施，以維民族生命。南京市府奉諭後，曾以「再敎育」爲中心，對於師資及課本等問題，均有詳明辦法之規定。茲悉敎育部以敵偽課本，前由不肖書業聯合組織之僞中國聯合出版公司大量印行，流毒甚深，即在京滬一帶，最近尙有無恥之徒，公然販賣採用，影響敎育甚鉅，特再重申前令，嚴電各省市必須認眞調查，取締，以期根絕，此外並再電令敎科書業恪遵辦理。茲錄敎部訓令正中，商務，中華，世界，開明，大東，文通等七家之原電如次：</p>
<p>國定本中小學敎科書七家聯合供應處鑒：查各省市中小學敎科書，應一律採用國定本，由該處所屬七家書局，負責供應，國定本尙未出版之各科各册，得暫准選用各書局遵照現行課程標準編輯，並經本部審定或核准發行之版本。收復地區以前敵偽編印修改之敎科書，為實施奴化敎育之工具，自應一律銷毀，各書局不准發行，各學校不准採用，業經飭遵在案。茲據報吿，收復地區各書局尙有發售僞敎科書，各學校亦有仍用僞敎科書爲敎材等情，實屬不合。各省市主管敎育行政機關，應嚴密調查取締，對於發行僞敎科書之書局，採用僞敎科書之學校，應予懲處。惟各省市所需國定敎科書，該處應督南所屬七家書局，充分準備，負南普遍供應，母使匱乏。除分行外，合亟電仰遵照辦理爲要。</p>
<p>其另令各省市敎育應局文電內容措詞亦甚嚴峻，本市各校對此頗為重視。聞對此項敵偽編印或曾送經敵偽審核刪改之坊間課本，均將一律檢舉，不許沿用。</p>

<h3>成都金陵女大　署假遷京復校</h3>
<p>吳貽芳抵京談</p>
<p>〔中央社南京二十日電〕我國出席舊金山會議代表國民參政會主席團主席金陵女子大學校長吳貽芳博士，去歲夏問赴舊金山出席聯合國會議後，因身體不適，在美休養多月，現已返國，十八日由滬來京。據談，美國朝野現正急於各項復員工作，各大學亦正準備解決收納數百萬復員軍人之就學問題，一般國民均不願再有戰爭，尤其於此原子學時代，益感世界和平與國際合作之重要。戰後工人失業問題，並不如想象之嚴重。從事戰時工業之工人，多已迅速轉於日用品工業中。至於金陵女子大學之復校事宜，吳氏稱，在京校址多已破壞不堪，校內儀器圖書傢具，亦損毀殆盡，恢復原狀殊非易事，本人日內即赴成都重慶，有所商洽，成都本校可望於五月底結束，暑假遷京。</p>

<h3>籃球聯賽第二幕　藍隊不敵巨人　女組綠隊輕取靑聯　另幕綠林擊退中一</h3>
<p>首屆籃球聯賽，昨夜爲第二幕，市體育館觀衆尙稱不少，三塲比賽，經過如下：</p>
<p>第一塲女子組，女中覇主綠隊與靑聯，綠隊雖以嚴蔚雯汪印蘭等之以嫁離隊，但人材濟濟，靑聯自難有所作爲，上半時一九對七，總結果三七對一八，綠隊旗開得勝。</p>
<p>第二塲甲二組錄林逢中一，後者固皆過去之名將，若胡國城，李嘉植等，惜皆久疏於此，開賽後，緣林節節佔先，陳國鎭籃下獲分，美不可言，上半時廾一對十二，完塲爲五六對二六，均綠林佔先。</p>
<p>第三塲甲一組藍隊鬥巨人，巨人有卡遜助陣，惟亦久疏練習，但其竄之速，及大將風度，仍令人擊節。上半時一五對一二，巨人佔前，下半時金堃先中，局勢漸現緊張，藍隊金長春金堃頻有妙射，竟以廾對一五後來居上，後即爲巨人以廾四對廾三超出，藍隊終以二七對卅惜敗。</p>

<h3>介紹國立東方語文專校</h3>
<p>— 郭畏英</p>
<p>國立東方語文專科學校，誕生於艱難困苦的抗戰時期，爲了適應國家現形勢的急迫需要而產生的，因此，它負有異常重大的使命。這所學校原設在雲南呈貢，去暑奉敎部令，才從呈貢遷到重慶。現在臨時校址是在離重慶廿公里的新開市，環境很好，與蔣主席官邸為鄰，林故主席墓地亦在近旁，幽僻而寧靜，是一個良好的讀書的地方。因本年春季即將東遷南京，所以設置方面，很是簡陋，校舍只有茅屋數間而已。該校校畏現已飛南京勘察校址。爲使課程早日結束準備東遷之故，今年將不放寒假，四月中旬即可還京。</p>
<p>語專的內部組織，分五科系，即印，緬，暹，越，馬來。課程與一般大學中所授者相同，繁忙而緊張。敎授也多爲國內知名之士和權威學者，有的是中大，復旦或政校所兼任者。同學和他校一樣來自全國各地，同學間感情非常融洽，學習研究的空氣也極濃厚。在已畢業的兩屆同學中，有些已去海外從事僑務工作，爲祖國，爲僑胞而効力，在不久的將來，我們更可以看到東方各地佈滿着語專學生的踪跡。</p>
<p>大後方的生活是艱苦的，物質條件的不夠，處處令人受窘，上課沒有課本，多靠講義和筆記，圖書館的藏書不大豐富，最近雙從印度購得大批圖書，但還不夠。晚上沒有電燈，五六個人團着一盞陰沉的煤油燈自修。這裏的同學都是公費生，這减輕了很多清寒學生的擔負，他們知道政府培植青年的苦心，也明折自身所負責任的重大，所以大家都孜孜不倦地在努力讀書。</p>
<p>語專同學的課外活動也很活躍，他們雖然是文科的學生，却也不忽略體格的鍛煉，所以運動場上經常少不了他們健美者的活動。學生自法會，負著同學福利的工作，有合作社和學術演講會等；其他如璧報也有十餘種。學術性的小團體也有幾個，如英文學習會，和東方學會，都有着很特出的工作表現。他們常舉行「晚會」，「座談會」等，以帮助課內學習的不足。</p>
<p>我們知道許多別的國家，他們都也設有東方學校，專門從事東方事物的研究，他們看得很重，而我國立國於東亞，當然更不容忽視的。爲了與其他國家的東方大學或學院能並駕齊驅之故，敎育部在原則上已允於遷京後再作老慮改院的問題。所以現在僅是時間的問題了，相信未來的東方語專，必有她底光明前途。這除了我們自身的努力外，還需要全國廣大社會人士的注意和督促。（一月十八日寄自重慶）</p>

<h3>中國科學家組織起來！</h3>
<p>— 鮑石溪</p>
<p>蘇聯發明一種最新式原子炸彈的消息傳出，接近英政府方面對此說曾表示懷疑。姑無論蘇聯令日是否業已發明新式原子彈，但共對此研究的苦心可見一斑。不觀乎蘇聯過去的『五年計劃』，一次二次的完成，新的『五年計劃』；强調各工業部門的發展，又從茲開始了嗎？他們的科學家，全都是埋頭苦幹，正所謂『鞠躬盡瘁，死而後已』的人物。而政府當局加以精神上的鼓勵，物質上的資助，其成功並不是偶然的。回頭看看咱們中國怎樣？科學界的國地是冷靜的，實有不能使人滿意之處。科學人才不是沒有的，弊在無組織，無資助，無鼓勵。個人力量有限，社團力量亦有限。科學界因此不能振作，不能專心，不能有所發明，有所貢獻。於是我們落伍，於是談不上「原子能」。更談不上原子炸彈了。</p>
<p>東亞的『睡美人』喲，醒來！『才子佳人』，『風流韻事』，已不是今日原子時代的東西了，已將成爲前進世界人類的渣滓了。</p>
<p>我們如不『迎頭趕上去』，力求國家科學化；研究新式武器，組織『原子』研究社，從事『起死回生』的科學鬥爭，將來我們直接或間接的感受生存的威脅，或被汰淘，是在所難免的了。</p>
<p>我們今日切不可心存依賴；盟邦的救助，固當銘感五中，然那是不足恃的。（固然眼前我們得利用他人的資力物力與才力，從事建國工作），可是我們要認識『天助自助者』這句格言。最妥善的辦法，還是與其『臨淵羨魚』，不如『歸而結網』。我們要『自力更生』，我們要埋頭苦幹。但是『工欲善其事，必先利其器』，我們第一要有組織，有資助，有鼓勵，有完善的科學研究社，有優良的儀器與藥品的設備，再加上苦幹的人才。有了這些先決條件，假以時日，難道我們中國的『原子』新發明，會拿不出來嗎？</p>
<p>今日歐美各國對科學研究機關，已從事大規模的聯絡與擴充，難道科學落後的我國，還是袖手旁觀，不急謀直追嗎？</p>

<p>這位想『飽死」的老夫子，未免太缺乏常識。</p>
<p>重慶電影院近來美片絕跡。放映的多係印度片和國產片。除了中製的『警魂歌」曾一度滿座外，大都生意冷淡。話劇無形中提高了賣座的紀錄。現在演出的『孔雀阻』和『歲寒圖』，都很能賣座。中國勝利劇社張光，也正在趕排陽翰笙的名劇『草莽英雄』，預備春節演出。演員陣容相當整齊，預料靑年館又將有一番熟鬧。</p>
<p>挑自來水有『帮口』，買電影票有黑市。沒有『帮口』的老百姓去站排挑水，輪到了的時候，也常會被『帮口』上的人搶去先挑。警察祇有瞪了眼，不敢干涉。電影片子好的時候，守秩序買票的人，好不容易排到『洞口』了，却常時會碰上『賣完』的好運。這雖是兩件小事，祇是容易使一般守秩序的人灰心，使不守秋序的人增長勇氣。要想改革社會上的不良風氣，應該從這些小事上着手。</p>
<p>建築在斜坡上的公園，這是山城的特色。近來，冬日高照，那陝長的傾斜草地上，和臨江的幾家茶座裏，都成了人們的消遣處所。江邊品茗，霧中談心。雖然比不上南京的玄武湖，北平的中山公園，却也另有風趣。</p>
<p>前幾天，重慶地方法院開庭時，有一位當事人稱推事爲『老爺』，稱女書記官爲『太太』，你會相信民國三十三年的陪都公民會鬧這種笑話？</p>

<h3>黑暗時常呈現眼前</h3>
<p>— 葛尙德</p>
<p>黑暗時常呈現在眼前，漫無涯際的黑暗。</p>
<p>教育不是可以隨便幹的事業。如果沒有堅實的經濟基礎，教育，被人們稱爲淸高事業的教育，也就不能生根，不能開花結實，不能收到美果的。非但不能收到美果，有時候甚至會出乎意料的發生惡果。</p>
<p>校舍是一座頗爲漂亮的私人住宅，這是學校常局費了九牛二虎之力租賃得來的。「私人住宅」總祇是私人的住宅，和「校舍」的條件並不稱合。這裏沒有操塲，近百寄宿生的早操塲所，僅是一方狹隘的屋頂。教室雖非過狹，但有些學級却容納了過多的學生，他們擠得那末緊，眞像罐頭裏的沙丁魚。當開學的時候，家長在學校峻拒下還把學生硬送過來，理由是其他學校也已無餘額，所以這責任也非學校常局所應獨負。</p>
<p>每度踏進教室，看到了擠得緊緊的「沙丁魚」，就塔然若喪，再提不起教學的興緻來。</p>
<p>不够寬敞的校舍決不能阻抑學生愛好活動的天性；相反的，唯其因爲沒有適當的遊息塲所，所以他們愈益活動起來。咆哮和跳躍，構成了一片騷動的景象。無論怎樣有教學修養的教員，也不易把這騷動「鎭壓」下來。</p>
<p>訓育處儘多的是「犯規」的紀錄。有時候不禁伸出顫抖的手，撫摩着被「訓斥」的學生的頭，熱淚盈眶了。</p>
<p>現階段的上海儘多的是弄堂學校，儘多的是這樣像「罐頭」的教室。有兩個年頭踏上了兩個大學的請臺，有更多個年頭踏上了更多個中學的講臺，發現了在講臺前面的全都是「沙丁魚」。</p>
<p>有心人定然會替「沙丁魚」們嘆息。但使有心人嘆息的還定然不祇是「沙丁魚」。</p>
<p>「兩袖淸風」這四個字，決不能形容出目下教員生活的窘態。菲薄的薪金還顧不了自己一個人的衣食住行：衣履殘破了；看到了街頭巷尾供苦力們大嚼的大鍋子混雜的牛肉和牛腸，總不禁垂涎欲滴；住是一個斗室的亭子問，擠着整個家族；行是只能仰仗造物賦予的一輛十一號汽車。至於仰事俯蓄，呀！怎談得到仰事俯蓄？</p>
<p>雖然有時候說謊是一種美德，但不能經常說謊，而且這法門常用了會失掉效力。結婚以來十有餘年無日不愁眉哭臉着的妻，時常「歡喜」作「糾纏」。</p>
<p>『錢帶來了沒有呢？』</p>
<p>『今天沒有帶來。』說過後就默然了。或是：『今天只帶這一點來。』說時忙着摸袋。接着是：『下個月可以多了，嘩扯嘩扯的拿給你。』說時自覺得意的笑了。其實寅吃卯糧，那末『嘩扯嘩扯』，眞自愧不如那些走江湖的拳手。</p>
<p>從學校走回家去，途經黃浦江畔，總會駐足下來，悽然凝視着不息東流或西流的江水好久好久。</p>
<p>教育的功能是無法否認的，但對於現階段的教育事業，眞不容易維持『信心』。</p>
<p>黑暗時常呈現在眼前，漫無涯際的黑暗。</p>
<p>服裝</p>
<h3>長衫可革</h3>
<p>— 戎惠蘭</p>
<p>記得戰前曾經有人提倡過廢除長衫，當時頗引起大家的注意。可惜倡導未久，不幸戰事發生，這事也就無人提起了。</p>
<p>現在和平初奠，勝利屬我，建設方始，一切都需革新改良。衣，食，住，行，民生四要，衣居其首，自然也當本着新生活原則來建設完善。回顧我國自民國成立迄今，尙無標準而合理的國民服裝，先總理雖創有中山裝，惜未普遍化，而今着者更少矣，良可憾也！</p>
<p>論到長衫，我認爲無非買時多化錢，做時多費工，着時不便利，除此之外，似乎別無特點。試看衣衫加身者，於上下車與上下樓或遇道路濕泥時，必前提後撩。偶一不愼，即有汚破之處。</p>
<p>有人說，着長衫爲了禦風防寒，這話似乎有理。可是炎夏暑天，爲什麼還要套上一件長衫呢？若說是取其大方，那麼明代的圓領寬袖，不是更大方嗎？再說中山裝又有什麼不大方呢？且按長衫，北人呼之爲大褂，是滿淸禮服，加於諸衣之外，故亦稱外褂外套，與旗袍同爲滿人服式。所以長衫在今天實在可以革除。</p>
<p>這次建設，廣義言之，就是興利除弊。故這里雖由長衫說起，但進一步說，凡不合理的服裝，都應徹底改革。而本着簡單，樸素，實用，便利，壯觀，諸原則建設完善，劃定標準合理的國民服裝，俾充分顯出黃族偉大精神。至於怎樣改善，這當然得靠有力者的倡導，和專家的設計了。筆者無非拋磚引玉耳。</p>

<h3>中國工業化</h3>
<p>— 鮑鍾佐</p>
<p>幾世紀來，我國手工業的工作效率極度地在减低，故政府現正擬實行一全國工業化的五年計劃，以替代日本，而成爲遠東的工業權威。</p>
<p>美國爲協助我國實行此項計劃起見，曾兩度派遣總統私人代表來我國視察經濟情形，並擬貸我鉅款供我，技工及物資。</p>
<p>中國政府尙須克復種種困難，如運輸工具缺乏，機械及技工不足，還有國內通貨膨賬等基本經濟問題。</p>
<p>實施工業計劃後，我國將能自製電話機，電報機，鐵路設備，貨車，自由車，電燈泡，玻璃，棉毛織品，罐頭食品，橡皮和冰箱及其附屬物等。</p>
<p>工業化的中國，不但能提高人民的生活水準，且將成爲一個不負外債的國家。</p>

<h3>Preliminary Agreement of the Military Group: National Army to be Reduced to Ninety Divisions, Communist Army to be Reorganized into Twenty Divisions</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 20th] The Military Group Conference of the Political Consultative Conference will hold its second meeting this afternoon. It is reported that at the first meeting, Mr. Zhang Qun first reported on the progress of the Military Three-Person Group talks, followed by Mr. Zhou Enlai's supplement. It is heard that the National Army has decided to reduce its size to ninety divisions, with 20,000 men per division, totaling 1.8 million men. The Communist Army will also be reorganized into twenty divisions, totaling 400,000 men. A preliminary agreement has been reached. As for how to implement the nationalization of the military and who will manage military and political affairs, further negotiations are needed. It is also learned that Miao Jiaming's suggestion to further reduce the aforementioned number of troops will also be discussed in the subgroup meeting. As for the Government Organization Group, subgroup negotiations have been held three times. A unanimous agreement has been reached on the need to make the country's highest policy publicly known. The Communist Party, the Youth Party, and the Democratic League have all insisted that the government must demonstrate actual democratic measures.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 21st] The National Assembly Group and the Constitutional Draft Group of the Political Consultative Conference's Subcommittee will meet at the National Government this afternoon at 3:00 PM. The Policy Guidelines Group will also meet at the Supreme National Defense Council at the same time. However, no agreement has been reached on any issues, and further negotiations are needed in each subgroup. Therefore, the general assembly will still not be held tomorrow.</p>
<h3>Marshall Returns to Chongqing to Continue Mediation; Mission to Shanghai Not Announced</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from Our Newspaper, Beiping, 21st] Marshall was originally scheduled to come to Beiping today but has postponed his visit due to unforeseen circumstances.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 21st] Marshall arrived in Chongqing from Shanghai at 2:30 PM this afternoon and, besides meeting with embassy staff, had no other formal appointments.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City] According to a report from U.S. military headquarters, U.S. Special Envoy to China, Marshal Marshall, left Shanghai at 11:30 AM yesterday and returned to Chongqing. During his two-day stay in Shanghai, he spent his time in meetings. He met several times with General Wedemeyer and Admiral Cooke, and provided instructions to senior officials of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration and American businessmen with status in Shanghai. Marshall expressed his regret that he could not meet with reporters due to the short duration of his visit to Shanghai and the large number of official matters. As for the main purpose of Marshall's visit to Shanghai, it is not convenient to announce.</p>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 21st] U.S. Envoy Marshall has completed his official business in Shanghai and returned here today. Political observers believe that Marshall will mediate on the unresolved issues of the various subcommittees of the Political Consultative Conference. At the same time, the various subcommittees are continuing their efforts to resolve the issues, especially the issue of organizing the State Council. The general assembly is scheduled to close on the 23rd. If these issues do not receive outside assistance, there is little hope of resolution. When reporters asked various individuals whether Marshall could make further efforts for China's unity, they said that they would not dare trouble Marshall as long as there was hope for a solution. However, the general public believes that Marshall will do his best to reorganize the military. This issue is currently being handled by the three-person committee of Zhang Qun, Zhang Zhizhong, and Zhou Enlai.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 21st] According to official sources, Marshal Marshall has postponed his visit to Xuzhou due to official business.</p>
<h3>Executive Headquarters for Coordination Issues Orders to Both Armies: Order to Retreat Automatically from Conflict Zones; Completion of the Ceasefire May Take Four Months</h3>
<p>[U.S. News Service, Beiping, 21st] The Executive Headquarters for Coordination issued its second order today, instructing the National and Communist armies in the conflict zones to cease fire and retreat a full day's journey from their respective conflict locations. The order will be enforced in both urban and rural areas, and the distance of the retreat will be at least twenty miles. The order was signed by Zheng Jiemin (representing the National Government), Ye Jianying (representing the CCP), and Robinson (U.S. military attache). Former Qian commanders were also ordered to immediately restore the positions as of midnight on January 13 after the separation of the two armies and the cessation of hostilities. The second order further implements the ceasefire agreement and supplements the procedures for dropping leaflets and dispatching mobile battlefield inspection teams. At the same time, the dropping of ceasefire leaflets was carried out on a large scale today. In thirty-one cities and towns in Shanxi, Hebei, Shandong, Henan, and Jiangsu provinces, 215,000 leaflets were dropped. Other flying units will continue to drop 145,000 ceasefire leaflets and 110,000 new instructional leaflets in thirty-one cities tomorrow. [United Press, Beiping, 21st] The Military Mediation Executive Department announced today: A mobile investigation team is scheduled to be dispatched from Shanghai to Guangzhou. This is the seventh team dispatched by the executive department, and the first team to be dispatched to Jiangnan.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 20th] Today is the seventh day after the ceasefire order took effect, and reports of gunfire and urgent telegrams from both sides continue to pour in. Speculative prices are also gradually rising again, and gold has broken the 90,000 mark. However, people familiar with the political situation told reporters that the prospects for peace are still optimistic. The parties who signed the ceasefire order are all sincere. The problem is that the conflicts in various places are the result of long-term historical developments. It is impossible to expect them to stop as quickly as a group exercise. However, if mediators go to the conflict sites and personally persuade them, they can certainly pull apart the two sides that are fighting. Once a ceasefire is in place at major conflict sites, other minor conflicts can be gradually reduced until they disappear. Some people in the Executive Department estimate that it will take four months to complete the ceasefire, while optimists judge that two months will be enough. If the three-person group in Chongqing can achieve good results, then this time will be further shortened. Currently, there are six "peacekeeping" groups that have set out: Jining, Chifeng, Zhangjiakou, Datong, Jinan, and Xuzhou. According to Mr. Butian, the American representative of the news group, the work of each group is going quite smoothly and there are no difficulties as imagined. The government and the Communist army are both very enthusiastic in their hospitality, but details have not yet been released. Reporters have also learned from other sources that, in the Chifeng area, in addition to the first plane being detained by the local Soviet troops due to a misunderstanding, the planes that have gone in the past two or three days have all received assistance from the Soviet troops. One or two more of these peacekeeping groups will be dispatched in the next few days. In addition to the American personnel, who have reached 125, the government and Communist Party personnel of the Executive Department have not yet arrived in full. Nearly 100 government personnel have arrived, but only 30 Communist Party personnel. Due to the shortage of manpower, work has not yet been fully launched. Most of the people who have come to Beiping work more than ten hours a day. The "219" and "209" rooms of the government and the "108" and "118" rooms of the Communist Party in the Beijing Hotel are lit all night long, which shows the intensity and hardship of their work. Although there are not many Communist Party personnel who have arrived, they have been transferred from Chongqing, Yanan, and Shanghai. It is said that there are many first-class talents, which may symbolize the sincerity of the Communist side. The three parties in the Executive Department get along very well. Every decision is made in a round table meeting. Ji Zepu, the government official in charge of the news group, also urged reporters to carefully release news and not to provoke the Communist side, which shows the harmony and determination of both sides to succeed. In addition to Miss Gong Peng, another propaganda person from the Communist Party has recently arrived, namely Qiao Mu, who writes international papers (Editor's note: Gong is Qiao's wife).</p>
<h3>Nie Rongzhen Discusses Peace While Receiving Delegation Representatives</h3>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 20th] Zhou Enlai said today that military conflicts in various places have ceased seven days after the issuance of the ceasefire order between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Zhangjiakou, 20th] Nie Rongzhen, Commander-in-Chief of the Communist Army in the five provinces of North China (including Pan Yang and Yingkou), declared at a banquet for the three-person inspection team tonight that he was willing to fully support the peace efforts of the Coordination and Execution Department in Beiping. Nie then gave a statement to news reporters, saying, "I am convinced that General Marshall is now working for peace in China. The Communist Party supports peace, needs peace, and hopes to achieve lasting peace." This morning, General Nie hosted the American and Kuomintang representatives of the inspection team to discuss the implementation of the "ceasefire order" in his jurisdiction.</p>
<h3>Zhu Jiahua Reports at the Standing Committee of the People's Political Council</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 21st] The Standing Committee of the People's Political Council held its fourteenth meeting at 9:00 AM on the 21st. The presidium members Wang Yunwu, Jiang Yong, Mo Dehui, and council members Yin Shuxian, Wu Zhaoxu, Qian Gonglai, Wang Puhan, Fan Yusui, Xu Deheng, Chen Qitian, Chu Fucheng, Zhou Binglin, Huang Yanpei, Xu Xiaoyan, Chen Bosheng, Hu Lin, Zuo Shunsheng, Li Huang, Luo Heng, Fu Sinian, Kong Geng, Hu Jianzhong, Zhang Junmai, and Dong Biwu, Secretary-General Shao Lizi, and Deputy Secretary-General Dang Zhen attended. Chairman Mo Dehui presided over the meeting. First, Minister of Education Zhu Jiahua reported on the receiving and processing of education in the recovered areas after the education rehabilitation conference was convened on September 20 of last year and the specific rehabilitation plan was decided. He gave a concise explanation of the organization of teacher screening, the establishment of temporary university cram schools, the handling of graduates and unemployed and out-of-school youth in the occupied areas, and the rehabilitation work of the schools that moved inland during the war. After Zhu's report, council members Chu Fucheng, Xu Deheng, Qian Gonglai, Yin Shuxian, Luo Heng, Fu Sinian, Xu Xiaoyan, Chen Qitian, etc., raised many questions on the damage to various schools in the occupied areas, the fees charged by private schools, and other issues, which Zhu answered one by one. Then, military inspection representatives were elected, and proposals were discussed: (1) Qian Gonglai and other five council members proposed that Anhui province is experiencing a shortage of grain due to the grain department's procurement. They requested the government to correct it quickly in order to pacify the people. It was resolved to submit it to the government for prompt correction. (2) Leng Tong and other twelve council members proposed that the local political and military expenses of various recovered counties in Jiangsu and Zhejiang are raised by the local governments, which the people cannot bear. They proposed requesting the central government to return all the local advances and that all political and military expenses be paid by the central government in the future in order to relieve the people's difficulties. It was resolved to submit it to the government for prompt investigation and handling. Finally, a temporary motion by council member Fu Sinian was passed, requesting Chairman Mo Dehui to represent the People's Political Council in comforting the people of the Northeast when he next goes to the Northeast.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 19th] The news that the city of Hunyuan in Yanbei was captured by the Communist army was announced by the command headquarters on the evening of the 19th. The Communist army attacking Tan Di consisted of more than 16,000 men transferred from Yanggao, Tianzhen, and Guangling, including more than 600 Japanese communists, equipped with 70-80 light and heavy machine guns, and 6-7 cannons. They began attacking the city at 11:00 PM on the 15th. By dawn on the 16th, the southwest of the city was breached by the Communist army. For the sake of self-defense, the National Army withdrew from the east gate after fierce street fighting and advanced northward. They were ambushed multiple times along the way, resulting in more than 380 casualties.</p>
<h3>Agricultural Loans for Recovered Areas: 2 Billion Yuan to be Released Soon</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 21st] After the victory last year, the government allocated 400 million yuan to recovered areas as emergency agricultural loans, which will be loaned out in stages. The first phase of 100 million yuan has already been loaned out to Jiangsu, Jiangxi, Hunan, and other provinces after their recovery. The second phase of 100 million yuan was also released in the middle of this month and distributed to more than ten recovered provinces such as Hebei, Shandong, Guangdong, and Henan as funds for farmers to purchase cattle, seeds, fertilizers, and farm tools. The remaining 200 million yuan will be loaned out recently.</p>
<h3>Construction of Ping Shan Airport in Hong Kong Temporarily Suspended Armed Protection</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Guangzhou, 21st] The Hong Kong New Territories authorities unreasonably erected an airport in Ping Shan, destroying dozens of villages in the area. After the villagers appealed to the whole country, it aroused opposition from the Chinese people. The New Territories Joint Village Representatives Deng Songnian and Zhong Shaoting came to the province to coordinate. In addition to sending telegrams to our supreme leader and allied political figures, our diplomatic commissioner Guo Dehua also argued against the airport. The Hong Kong authorities have agreed to request instructions from the British government, and armed protection of the Ping Shan airport construction has been temporarily suspended.</p>
<h3>Betts Says U.S. Military Will Temporarily Remain in China to Promote Stability and Peace; Sending Japanese Troops for Transfer to China</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Tianjin, 21st] Betts, a Republican member of the House Naval Affairs Subcommittee, is one of the ten members of the Navy and Agriculture Committees sent to North China to inspect the situation of the Marines. The delegation left Washington on January 5 and visited Okinawa and Japan. They have now come to China to inspect the Tenth Marine Division in Qingdao and the First Marine Division in Tianjin. Betts said, "The Marines have transferred the work of returning Japanese troops to the Chinese government, but this mission in China is not complete. While the good offices of the U.S. government are being used to promote a peaceful compromise between the two major forces in China, the Marines will remain in China for a longer period as a stabilizing military force. We seek lasting peace in the world, and we believe that another world struggle may be brewing if we do not lend a helping hand."</p>
<p>[United Press, Tianjin, 21st] Betts, a member of the House Naval Affairs Committee, announced today that the committee is focusing on four major issues: (1) disposal of surplus naval materials, (2) inspection of Pacific naval facilities, (3) troop demobilization, and (4) the general situation in the Pacific occupation or recovered areas. The length of time the U.S. military will remain in China will depend on how well China can cooperate in building a government that guarantees world peace and prevents future wars.</p>
<h3>Soviet Troops to Withdraw from Chengde and Chifeng Immediately; Northeast Industrial and Mining Issues Not Agreed Upon; Specific Issues and Details Still to be Discussed</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, Promoted Date] Authoritative sources say: The Soviet army in Chengde and Chifeng will withdraw today. The national army has arrived near the area and is preparing to take over defense duties from the Soviet army. Yingkou is a port received by the national army from the Soviet army, which was captured by the Communist army a few days ago. Authoritative sources did not explain the current situation in the area and the landing of the New Sixth Army in Huludao. The Soviet army in Changchun and Shenyang has made preparations for withdrawal, but the defense duties have not been formally handed over by both sides. Previous news from Changchun said that the Soviet army would withdraw from Changchun on the 20th, which is still too early to say. Our national army arriving in Shenyang can utilize the Changchun Railway to transport troops to Changha and other places for taking over defense duties. The date of February 1 for the Soviet army's withdrawal from the Northeast can be expected to no longer be delayed. Director Xiong was originally scheduled to return to Beiping today, but has postponed his return due to unfinished business there. On the eve of the Soviet army's withdrawal from the Northeast, Madam Chiang Kai-shek visited the Northeast border as the wife of the head of state to comfort and bid farewell to the Soviet army generals and soldiers who have successfully withdrawn from liberating the Northeast. There is no good news about the takeover of Andong. It is not that it cannot be taken over, but that there are difficulties in the takeover. And the Soviet army can do nothing about it. As for the industrial and mining issues, Chiang Ching-kuo may have reached some principles with the Soviet side in Moscow, and some specific issues and details still need to be discussed in Changchun. It is reported that the intermittent Sino-Soviet industrial and mining negotiations have lasted for several months, and at one point involved light industry, but the recent negotiations have been limited to heavy industry (Editor's note: The above is a conversation between a responsible person of the Xingying and a reporter from this newspaper, but he did not want to reveal his name).</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Jinzhou, 21st] Zhou Zhizou flew to Jinzhou at noon on the 21st to inspect the air force base and meet with Xiong and Du to convey important instructions from the central government. He returned to Beiping on the same plane that day.</p>
<h3>Guo Taiqi Said to be Appointed to England</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] A local diplomat revealed yesterday that after Wei Daoming returned to China, it was rumored in Chongqing political circles that the ambassador to the United States would be succeeded by Gu Weijun. The selection of a candidate for Gu's lost position as ambassador to England has become the focus of discussion. Guo Taiqi previously held the position for many years and had a very harmonious relationship with the British government and the public. He is currently living in leisure in the countryside of Chongqing and has a good chance of being selected.</p>
<h3>The Tense Situation in Kaifeng Has Passed; Communist Army in Northern Shanxi Captures Hunyuan County</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 21st] Xuzhou telephone: More than 10,000 members of the Yubei militia have been fighting hard on the northeast sides of Fengqiu. The tense atmosphere towards the citizens in the past two days has passed. The military and police are making serious preparations to prevent petty thieves. The curfew time has been advanced. Trains from Kaifeng to Zhengzhou and from Kaifeng to Xinxiang are running as usual, and the people are still at ease.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 21st] Xuzhou telephone: The Communist army, which was causing trouble in Fengqiu in northern Henan, was stopped by the local team at Zhoucun, 60 miles from Kaifeng, on the 19th. On the morning of the 20th, reinforcements were added to attack south. They are now engaged in fierce fighting with the Yubei militia. Also, the Communist army operating along the eastern section of the Longhai Railway, in order to support the offensive of the Yubei Communist army, has dismantled the railway tracks of about 30 miles from Huangkou Station to Licun Station between Kaifeng and Xuzhou. The tracks near Lanfeng have also been destroyed. Since the Japanese surrender, the traffic on the Bianxu section has been destroyed by the Communist army 83 times. The loyal and outstanding road workers are still desperately rushing to repair it.</p>
<h3>All False Lawyers and Accountants Will Have Their Qualifications Revoked</h3>
<p>And those who are reported to have aided the enemy with evidence will be prosecuted.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 21st] Chongqing News: In order to strictly prevent free professionals such as lawyers, accountants, doctors, and journalists who have aided the enemy with evidence of serious crimes from entering various institutions under false names to hide, the Executive Yuan and various courts are now formulating strict reporting measures based on various investigations to warn against treachery. It is heard that all false lawyers and false accountants who have registered with the puppet government and obtained certificates will have their qualifications revoked.</p>
<h3>Recent Situation in Taiwan</h3>
<p>— Zeng Jingke</p>
<p>Two weeks after Japan's unconditional surrender, the Taiwan Governor-General's Office had no choice but to announce it via broadcast because the truth could no longer be concealed. Almost every household in Taiwan had a radio (before the war, when I was in Tokyo, a regular radio cost only three yen, equivalent to two yuan and forty fen in our currency). So, this good news spread throughout Taiwan immediately, sparking thunderous cheers. Makeshift national flags of the Blue Sky, White Sun, and a Wholly Red Earth were waving everywhere. Initially, because the formal surrender hadn't happened yet, the Japanese military and civilians, out of embarrassment and anger, forbade celebrations and gatherings, and in some places, the national flags were even torn down by Japanese police. But a few days later—when the Japanese military and civilians realized that the "Imperial Army" had already collapsed and their dreams of aggression were shattered—they not only allowed the Taiwanese people to celebrate wildly but also, unprecedentedly and unequivocally, practiced "friendship" with them! They even hoped and pleaded for the "cooperation" of the Taiwanese people! Although the date of the formal surrender was still far off at that time.</p>
<p>Also, because we were too late in accepting the surrender, some losses and disputes occurred in Taiwan that could have been avoided. When the officials we sent to receive Taiwan's military and political affairs arrived after a long delay, it not only added many insurmountable difficulties, but also, because of this, the task of acceptance still cannot be completed. The true completion of this task, based on my personal observation as a reporter, will probably not be possible until at least half a year later:</p>
<p>First, the Japanese military and civilians, during the nearly two months of being already surrendered but not yet disarmed, arbitrarily provoked discord among the Taiwanese people, saying that they "obeyed the Emperor's order to liberate Taiwan and were all going to return to their farms; from now on, the Taiwanese people could be free; but China would soon send troops to conquer Taiwan, so the Taiwanese people would become slaves of China." Taiwan had been occupied by the enemy for as long as fifty years, and the Taiwanese people had been separated from the motherland for fifty years, so they were naturally skeptical of this last-minute goodwill from the Japanese military and civilians. The Japanese army also sold light weapons to the Taiwanese people cheaply, deliberately planting the seeds of disaster. Their treacherous intentions are truly hateful!</p>
<p>Second, when our receiving personnel arrived in Taiwan, it was already impossible to receive the military with a swift and decisive manner, so naturally, it was also impossible to immediately receive the political affairs. Moreover, the Taiwanese people did not understand Mandarin and Chinese, and most of the receiving personnel did not understand Taiwanese and Japanese, so the difficulties were naturally even greater.</p>
<p>Third, among the national army and military police stationed in Taipei, it is said that some people's behavior gave the Taiwanese people a bad impression, thereby providing the Japanese military and civilians with an excuse to undermine the feelings between the compatriots and the motherland, which led to the discovery of assassination squads jointly formed by Japanese and Taiwanese ruffians, and consequently, personnel from both the military and political receiving sides have gone missing.</p>
<p>General Chen Gongxia, the Chief Executive of Taiwan, is the most suitable candidate for governing Taiwan; based on his past achievements in governing Fujian, his future success in governing Taiwan can be guaranteed. I dare say: in today's Taiwan, no one but Chief Executive Chen can govern. Naturally, in today's Taiwan, no one but Chief Executive Chen can govern well. The difficulties mentioned above, except for those that are insurmountable but have already passed, I believe that Chief Executive Chen will definitely gradually find ways to overcome them. But in my personal humble opinion, those governing Taiwan should first pay attention to the following points:</p>
<p>1. After the complete military takeover, the first thing to do is to find a way to send more than 200,000 Japanese soldiers back to their country, and then find a way to send more than 300,000 Japanese residents back to their country.</p>
<p>2. After sending the Japanese military and civilians back to their country, immediately conduct a strict investigation and registration of weapons in the hands of the civilians, and find a way to concentrate and manage these weapons, either by providing compensation.</p>
<p>3. Carefully formulate a plan for governing Taiwan, and by no means make the Taiwanese people feel that things are worse now than they were before.</p>
<p>4. Carefully select the cadres for governing Taiwan, and by no means make the Taiwanese people lament that all crows in the world are equally black.</p>
<p>5. Do not use Japanese staff at all, and by no means allow the Taiwanese people and Japanese to criticize that Taiwan cannot be governed without the Japanese.</p>
<p>If these few points can be done surely and quickly, then not only will Taiwan be easy to govern, but it will definitely be governed well; otherwise, there will be no way to govern it. Chief Executive Chen recently reported his policy outline at an enlarged memorial week, saying: "In the active aspect, we must achieve (1) equality in education and service opportunities; (2) the establishment of genuine public opinion institutions; (3) raising the living standards of the people. In the passive aspect, we must achieve (1) reorganizing finances and reducing harsh taxes; (2) re-examining laws and regulations; (3) protecting the legitimate rights of the people."</p>
<p>This can certainly be considered a wise policy, but if I do not first achieve the few humble opinions that I have contributed earlier, then this kind of wise policy seems not easy to realize.</p>
<p>In addition, regarding the recent situation in Taiwan that I know about, there are still the following points that I can report to the people of the country:</p>
<p>(1) Taiwan is very close to Fuzhou and Xiamen, and can be reached every other day. Unfortunately, there is still no formal navigation to this day, and merchants travel by sailing boats, which are very dangerous in the event of a strong wind. In the past month, there have been frequent reports of capsized sailing boats. Last night, I received another telegram from the business community that three sailing boats loaded with goods from Keelung to Fuzhou capsized not far from Keelung due to unfavorable wind direction and failure to lower the sails in time. It is hoped that the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company can find a way to open shipping lines between Taiwan and other places as soon as possible.</p>
<p>(2) There are quite a few talented people in Taiwan. Most of the Taiwanese compatriots I know have received higher education, with the majority studying natural sciences. If used properly, these talents are all excellent cadres for building a new Taiwan. Because Taiwan has been under Japanese rule for as long as fifty years, people who study social sciences are considered more dangerous, so very few study them. However, there are many talents in the field of social sciences in various provinces of our country, and the personnel needed in Taiwan in the future can be exchanged with various provinces.</p>
<p>(3) Although very few Taiwanese young people can understand Mandarin, very few can even fully understand Taiwanese; what they learn and use is Japanese. This is the result of fifty years of slavish education, and it is not surprising. Therefore, Chief Executive Chen plans to make all Taiwanese young people understand Mandarin within four years. Even if it is not easy to universalize, it is by no means something that is absolutely impossible to do; as long as they can truly work hard, four years is not a short time.</p>
<p>(4) The aboriginal tribes of Taiwan all have a sense of nationhood. Japan ruled Taiwan for fifty years, but they never submitted. After Taiwan's recovery, they sent representatives such as Lumo to visit Chief Executive Chen, expressing their willingness to move to the plains and assimilate with the Taiwanese people. They are also preparing to organize a visiting delegation to visit the capital, pay homage to Sun Yat-sen's mausoleum, and have an audience with the head of state.</p>
<p>(5) Taiwan still uses the Taiwan dollar, and the exchange rate between the Taiwan dollar and the legal tender has not yet been determined, but it is roughly equivalent to customs gold units. Merchants all load goods from Fuzhou to sell in Taiwan, and then buy goods back after selling them. If there are no accidental losses in one round trip, one yuan can become five yuan. Although sea travel is dangerous, there are still many people coming and going. Recently, Chief Executive Chen ordered that gold and sugar are not allowed to be exported. However, merchants are resourceful, and there are still many who go to Taiwan to barter.</p>
<p>(6) There used to be many kinds of newspapers in Taiwan, with the "Taiwan Daily News" having the widest circulation. The "Taiwan Daily News" has now been taken over by our side and reorganized into the "New Life Daily," which still has a page printed in Japanese (similar to the "Shanghai Daily News" run by the Japanese in Shanghai before the war) to help the Taiwanese people understand current events. The "Xingnan New Daily" has now been renamed "Minbao." There is still no official party newspaper. Chief Executive Chen said that Taiwan should have a party newspaper, which will either be run by someone sent by the Central Propaganda Department in the future, or by the Taiwan Provincial Party Headquarters.</p>
<p>(7) Taiwanese Li Youbang graduated from the first class of the Whampoa Military Academy. Since 1926, he has served as a special commissioner of the Taiwan Provincial Party Headquarters. After the Anti-Japanese War, he organized the Taiwan Volunteer Corps, and the Military Affairs Commission appointed him as the commander of the corps. I received a letter from him yesterday, saying that he will cross to Taiwan from Xiamen today, and I heard that he will serve as the Executive Secretary of the Taiwan Branch of the Three Principles of the People Youth League. Sent on December 17th.</p>
<h3>Jinpu Railway Actively Under Repair; Dismantling the Nanjing-Wuhu Railway Tracks to Meet Urgent Needs</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 21st] The important project of repairing the Jinpu Railway has been actively launched. The tracks of the Jiangnan Railway from Nanjing to Wuhu have begun to be dismantled to meet the urgent needs of the Jinpu Railway. Vice Minister of Transportation Ling Hongxun will head north before the closing of the Highway Conference to supervise the road repairs.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 20th] The situation of transportation destruction in North China has not decreased recently. On the 18th, three trains on the Pinghan Line in Gaobeidian were destroyed by Communist landmines, causing many casualties. Several sections north of Qiancang County on the Jinpu Line have also been destroyed, so it is impossible to reach Cang County. The Ministry of Communications has launched railway repair work and has formed a "rush team" to repair the damaged railways, and another "emergency repair team" to repair temporary damage at any time, in order to complete all repairs within the time limit set by the government.</p>

<h3>Disagreement with Left-Wing Cabinet Members; De Gaulle Suddenly Resigns; Three Parties to Form a Coalition Government</h3>
<p>[Our Report] According to a London broadcast on the 21st: French Interim President Charles de Gaulle suddenly resigned on Sunday. The French government has decided to hold an emergency meeting tomorrow to elect a new interim president to replace De Gaulle. (See the third page for De Gaulle's brief biography.)</p>
<p>[Our Report] According to a Paris broadcast on the 21st: The three major political parties in France, namely the Communist Party, the Socialist Party, and the Catholic Party, although they have had long-standing disputes in the past, there is now hope for the three parties to form a coalition government tonight. According to French Foreign Minister Bidault, "We will soon form a three-party coalition government."</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 20th] French Interim President Charles de Gaulle's secretary, Barroski, announced today that President de Gaulle has resigned due to a dispute with left-wing cabinet members over military spending. The cabinet discussed the matter for four hours. The Communist Party and the Socialist Party insisted on reducing the army's budget by another 20%, but Army Minister Michelet refused. De Gaulle supported the Army Minister and, due to the international situation, also refused to approve the reduction. Now his intention to resign is firm and irreversible.</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 21st] Since General de Gaulle resigned on Sunday, France has fallen into a state of political chaos without a head of government. The Communist Party requested tonight that its leader, Thorez, be elected as the new President of France. After several meetings with the leaders of the People's Republican Party and the Socialist Party, Communist Party Secretary-General Duclos said that the Communist Party demanded to obtain the leadership position of the new coalition government. The Communist Party is the largest political party in France, but its power is too weak without the joint organization of a government by another major party.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 21st] After General de Gaulle resigned as head of government, the Communist Party, which has the strongest power in Parliament, seems to be launching rapid steps to resolve the crisis. Communist Party leader Thorez will consult with the Progressive Catholic Party and the Socialist Party today to form a three-party coalition government, with Thorez himself as the head. If that fails, the Radical Party will join the Socialist Party-Communist Party united front, and then the seat of head of government may fall to Herriot, the former Prime Minister of the Radical Party. Sources said that General de Gaulle is scheduled to leave Paris tonight, and his original broadcast for tonight has been canceled.</p>
<h3>UN Committees to Convene This Week; Atomic Energy Commission Established</h3>
<p>[Our Report] According to a London broadcast on the 21st: The powerful Political and Security Committee of the United Nations General Assembly unanimously passed the recommendation to establish an Atomic Energy Commission today. This recommendation was provided by the Three Great Powers Foreign Ministers Conference last month. The vote in favor was as high as 46 votes, and there were no dissenting votes. Only the Philippines refused to vote. The committee will include delegations from the Security Council, plus Canada.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 20th] The speeches by the representatives of the United Nations General Assembly have been completed for six days, and after Iran applied to the Security Council for mediation of the dispute with the Soviet Union, they were declared closed. From now on, the United Nations organization will seriously deal with thorny issues. The establishment of the Atomic Energy Management Committee, the handling of refugee issues and trusteeship issues, and secondary proposals are being drafted by the competent committee. Although the representatives of the major powers have discussed the Iranian issue, the election of the Secretary-General of the United Nations organization, with an annual salary of US$25,000, must also be finalized through off-site negotiations. At least six committees will meet daily this week, and the General Assembly itself plans to hold an extraordinary meeting on Thursday. The Security Council should meet this week, and the Economic and Social Council is scheduled to hold its first meeting on Wednesday. In addition, the issue of new members in Europe joining the United Nations organization is expected to be raised in the General Assembly as soon as possible. The United Kingdom announced today in the Membership Qualifications Review Committee that there are 13 countries in Europe that should be allowed to join, and France agreed with the United Kingdom's proposal to approve them as soon as possible. Once the qualifications of new members in Western Europe are approved, the Soviet Union will also apply for the admission of the Baltic countries.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 21st] The agenda of the United Nations General Assembly this week will give top priority to the control of atomic energy. The report of the Atomic Energy Commission can be submitted to the General Assembly at that time, and the small countries will finally have the opportunity to express their opinions on this terrible power. The United Nations General Assembly has now turned to the discussion of practical issues, so the absence of Soviet Deputy Foreign Ministers Molotov and Vyshinsky is indeed influential. Vyshinsky's whereabouts are unknown. Yesterday, it was learned that he could arrive in London that day, but he still did not appear. The Soviet Union is clearly extremely concerned about Iran's formal request to the Security Council to investigate the Azerbaijan incident. Indian Chief Representative Mudaliar is expected to be elected as the chairman, and the Trusteeship Committee will also meet at the beginning of this week. However, the formal establishment of the Trusteeship Council may have to wait until the General Assembly to be convened in April this year. According to the charter, the Trusteeship Council must wait until the trust territory is ready to be governed by it before it can be actually established. British Prime Minister Attlee may reiterate the trusteeship issue when the British Parliament resumes this week.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 20th] Irdil, director of the press office of the Turkish delegation to the United Nations General Assembly, announced yesterday: If the Soviet Union, based on the recommendations of two Georgian professors, demands that Turkey cede 12,500 square miles of Black Sea territory near the Armenian Soviet Republic, Turkey will resist. Turkey has not yet raised any difficulties with the United Nations organization, but if any issues involving the United Nations Charter arise in the future, it will definitely seek a solution within this organization.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 21st] Australian representative Makin, chairman of the United Nations Security Council, hopes to obtain a decision today on how and when the Council will consider Iran's request for an investigation into Soviet interference in Iran's internal affairs. He does not hope to convene an extraordinary meeting of the Council, but plans to raise this issue at the next regular meeting.</p>
<h3>Failure of Negotiations with the Soviet Union; Iranian Prime Minister Resigns</h3>
<p>Iran and the Soviet Union May Reopen Negotiations</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Iranian Capital, 21st] Iranian Prime Minister Hakimi announced last night that negotiations with the Soviet Union on the Azerbaijan Province incident had failed and immediately resigned. Hakimi's resignation was predictable last week. At that time, he declared to the parliament that the government's foreign policy had failed, and the efforts to negotiate with the Soviet Union were of no avail. He planned to submit the Iranian-Soviet dispute to the United Nations organization. According to Hakimi today, "I have informed the King that I will submit the Iranian case to the United Nations General Assembly, and I am now preparing to step down."</p>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 21st] The Iranian representative to the United Nations General Assembly said today that after Iranian Prime Minister Hakimi resigned, Iran and the Soviet Union may conduct direct negotiations to resolve their disputes.</p>
<p>[Reuters, German Guan, 21st] Iranian Minister of Posts and Telegraphs and Mayor of German Guan, Naliman, resigned as minister to Prime Minister Hakimi last night, which is the fourth change in Hakimi's cabinet in a month.</p>
<h3>Greek People Demonstrate Against Imperialism</h3>
<p>[United Press, Athens, 20th] The Democratic Political Alliance held a mass rally here today, with 300,000 people attending. This is the largest demonstration in Greece's history. At that time, Greek leaders claimed that the only meaning of King George's return to Athens was revolution, and they denounced foreign interference, saying that it insulted the self-esteem of the Greek people. The mass rally passed three resolutions: First, to demand that democratic parties unite against imperialism. Second, to purge all reactionary and Quisling elements in the army, police, and government agencies. Third, to demand the formation of a democratic coalition government and allow the people's resistance movement to participate in it.</p>
<h3>Australian Wool Donated to Gandhi</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 21st] According to a Melbourne radio broadcast, the Australian Wool Industry Association sent experts to carefully select 25 pounds of super clean wool to donate to Gandhi for weaving shawls. The batch of wool is scheduled to be flown to India from Melbourne today. The proposer of this proposal is the Governor of Bengal, Khan, who will give this wool to Gandhi's maid for weaving before leaving India. Another batch of gifts, totaling 200 bags of wool, will soon be transported to India and distributed to various village weaving mills in Bengal.</p>
<h3>US National Steel Industry Begins Unprecedented Strike Yesterday Afternoon; Over 1.6 Million Participants; US Overall Productivity Will Be Severely Affected</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Pittsburgh, 21st] 750,000 steelworkers began a strike at midnight today (1:00 PM Shanghai time) to demand higher wages. The total number of striking workers in the United States has thus reached over 1.6 million, setting an unprecedented record. 1,300 factories in 33 states have all been shut down. Steel factory owners and steelworkers are now just beginning their final struggle. No one is willing to speculate on when the strike can end. Before the strike, work in various factories was already slow, and a few factories had completely shut down even before the formal announcement of the strike. Murray, President of the Congress of Industrial Organizations of America and President of the Steelworkers Union, has gone to Washington to personally lead the demand for wage increases. Murray has not expressed his opinion on the strike situation, but he plans to broadcast to the country tonight. Small, director of the Civilian Production Administration, is preparing to order that civilian and military factories no longer have the right to purchase steel with priority. It is expected that most factories will be shut down within two weeks due to lack of steel. According to Washington news, the meatpacking plants in 30 states that have gone on strike may be placed under government management.</p>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 21st] News from Washington reports that the government is now considering taking over meatpacking plants this week to prevent the interruption of meat consumption by civilians. If the steel strike shows no sign of resolution by next week, the government may take over the steel factories at that time. As of this morning, there has been no news of disturbances. However, judging from the situation, the company and the union are expected to argue over who will send people into the factory to maintain order. Today, neither the union, the company, nor the government side harbors the hope that the strike will be resolved soon. This strike is very detrimental to the US economy. It is estimated that 40% of overall productivity will be affected by the strike. The number of striking workers in the United States has now increased to 1,657,000, and 400,000 shipbuilding workers may also strike at the end of the week.</p>
<h3>Vyshinsky</h3>
<p>[Our Report] According to a London broadcast on the 21st: The mystery of the whereabouts of Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky, the chief representative of the Soviet Union to the United Nations General Assembly, has now been broken. Vyshinsky arrived in Berlin this afternoon and is scheduled to fly to London tomorrow morning.</p>
<h3>The List of Representatives for the United Nations Chiefs of Staff Conference Announced; Shang Zhen as the Head of the Delegation, Scheduled to Depart Tomorrow</h3>

The delegation is scheduled to depart on the 23rd of this month.</p>
<p>Short commentary</p>
<h3>De Gaulle Suddenly Resigns</h3>
<p>A telegram from Paris reports that General Charles de Gaulle, the Provisional President of France, abruptly resigned over disagreements with left-wing cabinet members regarding French military preparations, and his intention to resign is very firm. The telegram did not provide many details, but the general political sentiment in France is that General de Gaulle's resignation will be permanent. Although this news came suddenly, it was not entirely unexpected. Since the establishment of the Fourth Republic government, the French Communist Party has been considering subverting the coalition government to expand its power and had long intended to force De Gaulle to resign. However, the first election under the Fourth Republic government did not give left-wing parties, including the Communist Party, an absolute majority. Instead, a coalition government was formed by the three parties with the most votes: the Communist Party, the Socialist Party, and the Popular Republican Movement. The Popular Republican Movement, with its Catholic base, has fundamental differences in political views with the Communist Party, making the Socialist Party a crucial swing vote. This political change in France is due to the collusion between the Socialist Party and the Communist Party. Although the future evolution of the French political situation is unpredictable, this political change undoubtedly represents the rise of left-wing political parties in France. However, we cannot ignore another fact: the Popular Republican Movement, representing French interests, remains a major force under the Fourth Republic.</p>
<p>General de Gaulle's efforts for France should be immortalized in French history. Although some criticize him for being stubborn, which has caused many unpleasant events in international relations, including the recent Bertin affair in China, his efforts to restore France's past glory should be praised by the world. His high domestic and international reputation is unmatched by any other French person. Although he has expressed a firm intention to resign, according to a United Press dispatch from Paris, some believe that the situation may not be so dire within eight days, and there are reasons for this. The French Third Republic had 108 changes of government in its 58-year lifespan, averaging three per year. We hope that the politics of the Fourth French Republic can stabilize, as this is of great importance to the European situation and world peace.</p>
<h3>President Truman's Message to Congress Reports on Foreign and Domestic Affairs; Will Use All Efforts to Support UN Organizations; Fully Utilize Opportunities to Foster Economic Expansion</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 21st] President Truman presented a "State of the Union" message to Congress on the 21st (American time, Eastern time being the 22nd), emphasizing that the United States has the responsibility to assist UN organizations in achieving world cooperation and lasting peace, and warning the American people not to ignore the serious post-war problems due to vast commercial prospects and opportunities. The message places the task of the UN organization's success largely on the United States. The message stated: "We can build a lasting peace on the foundation of victory, enabling greater freedom and security for people at home and around the world. I have decided to combine the traditional State of the Union message with the annual budget request, which includes not only estimates for projects already authorized by Congress but also estimates for projects I propose to initiate. Modern government has an increasingly important responsibility to foster economic expansion and ensure full utilization of opportunities, so it is necessary to formulate government procedures based on the overall national economic situation. As this year begins, the United States is strong and confident, with a record of great achievements in solving various problems and adapting to various opportunities. We have countless advantages, such as vast natural resources, huge factory equipment, superior technology and management skills, and capable citizens. In the immediate future, the commercial outlook is generally very favorable, to the point that there is a risk that our serious post-war problems may be overlooked. Therefore, we must proceed with foresight and steady steps, taking care to avoid mistakes and not being misled by the prospect of prosperity, forgetting the fundamental complexity of modern affairs. Our country has always been a place where people around the world who want to become part of us can find great opportunities, and now our country has a great responsibility to all the people of the world. We must resolutely recognize and address these responsibilities. Advances in science, communication, and transportation have made the world a family, and the economic and political health of each country in the world directly affects the economic and political health of every other country. Centuries of evolution have brought us into a new era in world history, and the interrelationships between countries must develop in complex new ways. The newly established UN organization is only the basic beginning, and it must be developed rapidly. For example, economic cooperation should now be handled as carefully and comprehensively as political security measures. It is important for countries to gather and participate in the General Assembly and the Security Council, but this is not enough. To achieve security, in addition to consultation and proper governance, we should develop UN organizations to become representatives of a unified world. As we enter a new era of international relations, we have many new responsibilities. The power, intelligence, and wisdom of our government and people should be concentrated and dedicated to international action."</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 21st] The US President sent a message to Congress today, outlining the United States' general plans and budget, and reviewing its foreign and domestic policies. Truman broke with the tradition of sending separate State of the Union and budget messages and combined them into one, presenting the budget simultaneously to accommodate its foreign and domestic plans. Most of the message concerned foreign policy issues. Truman reiterated the twelve points of foreign policy he outlined in his Navy Day speech on October 27th of last year. It is said that the long-term and significant goal of American foreign policy is to establish and maintain a just peace. Our basic policy towards the Far East is to encourage the establishment of a strong, independent, unified, and democratic China, which is the traditional policy of the United States. The President then pointed out that the United States' goal is to restore Korean sovereignty as soon as possible and to establish a government freely chosen by the Korean people. In his statement on Far Eastern foreign policy, the President reviewed the United States' position in the Yalta, Potsdam, and Moscow conferences. He particularly emphasized the importance of the United States' participation in various international conferences and organizations to seek world security and prosperity, and reiterated that the United States' continued full support for the United Nations is part of its foreign policy. He assured that the United States will use its full strength to support and develop the United Nations organization to prevent international war. The United States' foreign economic policy is to promote its own prosperity and assist in the recovery and development of world markets, thereby contributing to world peace and security. The United States will ensure relief and assistance to war-torn areas, assist in their reconstruction and development, and expand world trade. He also warned that the smooth implementation of foreign economic policy depends on domestic policies to maintain full production and employment, and emphasized that a serious economic downturn in the United States would be enough to undermine the economic structure of the entire world. Some observers believe that today's message is a precursor to the annual national income budget that will be stipulated in the future Full Employment Act.</p>

<h3>MacArthur Orders Seizure of Japanese Aircraft Factories for Reparations</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 21st] General MacArthur today ordered the seizure of 394 aircraft factories and wartime experimental laboratories belonging to the Japanese Army and Navy arsenals, in order to keep them intact for reparations to the invaded countries. According to MacArthur, Japan had allowed equipment worth tens of millions of dollars to deteriorate and had also dismantled machinery within the factories. Therefore, he instructed the Japanese government not to dismantle them further and dispatched troops in four regiments to guard them, in order to maintain their integrity. The aircraft factories and aircraft parts factories affected by this directive totaled 265. Reparations Commissioner Pauley had listed them as first-priority materials, ready to be transferred to other countries. Among them, 47 belonged to the Nakajima Aircraft Company, 19 each belonged to the Mitsubishi and Aichi companies, 15 belonged to the Kawasaki Company, and 9 belonged to the Hitachi Company. The naval arsenals of the former major naval bases of Yokosuka, Yokohama, Sasebo, and Kure, and the arsenals of Tokyo, Nagoya, Osaka, and Kokura, were also ordered to be maintained by the Supreme Commander.</p>
<h3>US Military Authorities Order Dissolution of Unofficial Korean Military Groups, Including Boy Scouts</h3>
<p>[United Press, Seoul, 21st] Lieutenant General Hodge, Governor General of the Korean US Military Government, today ordered the dissolution of all unofficial military groups within the territory, including the Boy Scouts (Korean Boy Scouts are unrelated to international scouting organizations). At the same time, military authorities continued to investigate the disturbances between the left and right factions of the previous two days.</p>
<p>[United Press, Seoul, 20th] The US occupation authorities ordered the start of an investigation into the conflict between the left and right factions of Koreans, which occurred on the morning of the 19th of this month when 200 members of the Korean Student League marched to protest the UN trusteeship of Korea, clashing with police near the headquarters of Lieutenant General Hodge, commander of the US occupation forces. Police fired over 100 shots, arresting 119 people and dispersing the demonstrators, killing two people and injuring many others.</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Bans Religious Freedom; Pope Issues Exhortation of Reprimand</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] According to a San Francisco broadcast on the 20th: Pope Pius XII issued an encyclical yesterday to commemorate the 350th anniversary of the return of the Ruthenian Church to Rome, pointing out and reprimanding the current situation of the Ruthenian Church and the Soviet Union's ban on the spread of Catholicism. In this papal encyclical, the Pope continued to ask all members of the United Nations to earnestly implement the promise of religious freedom and denounced the Soviet Union's severe prohibition of the spread of Catholicism in Ruthenia and eastern Ukraine as illegal. Ruthenia was originally the easternmost part of Czechoslovakia and has now been incorporated into the Soviet Union. Its people are all Catholic believers who worship the Roman Pope. Since its annexation by the Soviet Union, its people have suffered all kinds of oppression from the Soviet Union, forcibly abandoning their long-held religion.</p>
<h3>Unrest Continues in Jerusalem</h3>
<p>[United Press, Jerusalem, 20th] Another terrorist incident occurred here yesterday. Therefore, a large number of military police today strictly enforced martial law, searching for weapons, ammunition, and suspected terrorists in the quiet city. According to a government bulletin, rioters attempted to destroy the Palestine Broadcasting Station. As a result, two people were killed and one seriously injured in the chaos. One of the dead was a British officer, and the other was an armed Jew. The injured was a British police officer. The power substation was only slightly damaged because the military police acted quickly, so the entire substation and nearby radio station were preserved. An investigation in the Jewish quarter this morning found many firearms, bombs, explosives, ammunition, and other weapons.</p>
<h3>US Scientists Invent New Drug to Treat Malaria; More Effective Than Quinine</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 20th] US scientists report that a new synthetic drug has been invented to treat malaria, which is more effective than Atabrine or quinine. The drug is called SN7618. According to the Malaria Research Cooperative Committee, its onset of action is three times faster than the above two drugs when used to treat acute malaria, and it does not need to be taken daily, but can be taken weekly to alleviate the disease. This drug does not stain the skin like Atabrine, nor does it easily cause tinnitus like quinine, and it does not cause nausea, which the other two drugs may cause. At the same time, another new drug was announced in science, which has the hope of curing relapsing malaria, which is common among returning soldiers. However, neither new drug is available to the public, and the latter is still in the early stages of experimentation, so there is no specific name. At least 300 million people worldwide suffer from malaria each year. The United States spent $5 million on research during the war, testing 14,000 compounds in order to invent a cure. Prisoners and those awaiting rebuttal mostly volunteered to contract the disease for treatment for experimental purposes. Hundreds of thousands of seabirds, chickens, ducks, monkeys, dogs, mice, and rabbits were used in the laboratory. The first new drug has been used to treat 5,000 malaria patients, including more than 1,000 soldiers, with considerable success, but it cannot be made available to the general public until further testing. The drug is named SN7618 because it was successful after 7,618 trials in a four-year research program. Its method of preparation is to combine a part of an Atabrine molecule with another chemical. According to scientists, there are six other new drugs in the same chemical family that appear to be superior to Atabrine, but it is not yet known whether they are superior to SN7618.</p>

<h3>Sudden Announcement of Withdrawal from French Political Circles; Where Will De Gaulle Go?</h3>
<p>— Special Article from This Newspaper's Information Office</p>
<p>Just when all the people of France and the people of the United Nations were watching General Charles de Gaulle, the chairman of the French government, a shocking piece of news came out that he had resolutely resigned!</p>
<p>There are many reasons for his resignation this time. This newspaper has already analyzed this and published it on the second page. It does not seem necessary to repeat it here. The purpose of this article is only to look back on his past and look forward to his future. But we first believe that since the French armistice with Germany in June 1940, General de Gaulle has tirelessly traveled to London, North Africa, and Paris to lead Free France and fight.</p>
<h3>French People Expect De Gaulle to Work for the Motherland</h3>
<p>What General de Gaulle has accomplished in the past cannot be considered anything, and now he has things he needs to do, and at the same time France has infinitely important work waiting for De Gaulle to do. He will be the only leader best suited to taking on the task of rebuilding France, so people are waiting for him to use his immense power to rebuild France. This unanimous national and even global confidence in him for the reconstruction work requires courage, intelligence, and faith, and General de Gaulle is recognized to possess these excellent qualities and qualifications. His qualifications in France can be described in one sentence: General de Gaulle is a rare genius in the entire chronicle of France, an organizer who recombines the dispersed popular spirit and popular strength of France. He is the strong mainstay of democratic and free France.</p>
<p>President de Gaulle suddenly resigned this time. Will this cause the French train to derail? This is the only basis for the world's alarm.</p>
<h3>France's First Head of State: From Humble Beginnings</h3>
<p>General de Gaulle is the first head of state of France in five years to be elected by the people. The suffering and tribulations he has endured are difficult to fully describe, and his experiences in the last half-year alone have been beyond the endurance of ordinary people. It wouldn't be wrong to say he lacked patience, but he has, after all, persevered and fought through it all. His resignation is not as simple or passive as some news reports suggest, stating that he is exiting the political stage; it is highly possible that it has the potential for taking a step back and then advancing two steps forward.</p>
<p>The General's name is Charles; besides the "given name" Charles, he also has three other names: André, Joseph, and Marie. He was born in Lille, France, on November 2, 1890, making him 56 years old this year.</p>
<p>In his childhood, he stood out for his love of work and diligent studies. He later entered the Saint-Cyr Military Academy, rising from the ranks of a common soldier and eventually displaying his extraordinary talent.</p>
<p>On August 2, 1914, General de Gaulle was assigned to the 1st Battalion of the 33rd Infantry Regiment, at which time he held the rank of lieutenant. In this initial battle, he displayed the utmost courage. Even after being wounded, he returned to the front lines as soon as he recovered. The Second Division, seeing his bravery and skill in battle, awarded him with the following words: "De Gaulle has repeatedly reconnoitered enemy positions under dangerous conditions and obtained much valuable information." This shows the high regard in which he was held by his superiors. Subsequently, he also participated in the famous Battle of Verdun during World War I, achieving meritorious service.</p>
<h3>A Shell Arriving on the Front Lines: Waiting for it to Explode</h3>
<p>At this time, let us cite another example to illustrate de Gaulle's character. One day, while he and two comrades were on a reconnaissance mission, a shell was launched by a grenade launcher. They all clearly saw the shell flying above them. The two lieutenants lay down, but he stood waiting for it to explode. After the smoke cleared, he said to them simply, "A little startled, gentlemen?" This story illustrates his spirit of courage, composure, sincerity, and friendship. As for his contributions in the war against Germany, they are widely praised.</p>
<p>Since 1940, France's domestic affairs, diplomacy, and military affairs have faced unprecedentedly severe crises. After a brief period of chaos and significant damage, the French national liberation movement, under the leadership of General de Gaulle, greatly expanded, showing signs of revival and strength in unity everywhere.</p>
<h3>French Assembly Debates Become Increasingly Intense</h3>
<p>Over the past six months, President de Gaulle has endured debates in the French Assembly, which have become increasingly heated. Weeks ago, due to the issue of national defense spending, de Gaulle once threatened to resign. At that time, the Socialist Party and the Communist Party both said that France was spending too much on the military and insisted on cuts. An agreement was reached by New Year's Day: If the government did not submit a proposal for the reorganization of the army before February 15, the 20% cut in expenses they demanded would automatically take effect on February 20. Regarding the food problem, the government's policies were also severely criticized by all parties in the Assembly. In terms of government, the Communist Party held 147 seats, making it the largest party in the Assembly; the Socialist Party held 138 seats; the Progressive Catholic Party held 135 seats; the Radical Socialist Party held 26 seats; and the Moderate Party and various right-wing parties held a total of 76 seats. De Gaulle's government, based on these three major parties, advocated that not only should the cabinet bear collective responsibility, but also that each minister should receive the support of all parties. However, things did not go as planned, and de Gaulle ultimately resigned in this environment.</p>
<h3>Dressed in New Governmental Attire: Returning to the Stage</h3>
<p>In fact, General de Gaulle, as President of the Provisional Government, had gained the trust and support of the national electorate. As long as the French people and political parties, under de Gaulle's leadership, further strengthen their unity and increase their courage, and under the conditions that all internal wars have disappeared and social unrest is being avoided as much as possible, the days of France's economic recovery will be in sight. However, regrettably, the three major political parties in France achieved victory in the general election, but failed after taking office. De Gaulle's resignation has little to do with his personal gains or losses, but has a huge relationship with the French people. General de Gaulle knows this very well and will not disappoint the people of his country. Although his determination to resign is irreversible, he may still have a chance to make a comeback in the short term. General de Gaulle will appear dressed in another new government attire, leaving us no room for panic or disappointment.</p>
<h3>Sun Ke of the Membership Committee Explains the Draft of the Five-Five Constitution to the Ninth Cooperative Industry Conference, Analyzing its Principles, Spirit, and Content in Detail</h3>
<p>Fourth, there is often a misunderstanding in the outside world regarding the method of exercising the five powers stipulated in the draft constitution. Many people mistakenly believe that the five-yuan system of the National Government over the past ten years is the future five-yuan system.</p>
<p>The Five-Yuan System</p>
<p>The current five-yuan system is the five-yuan system of the period of political tutelage. The legislative principles of the Legislative Yuan are determined by the Central Committee of the Kuomintang, which then passes them to the Legislative Yuan to formulate laws. The current Legislative Yuan does not have the power to initiate laws. All proposals must also be approved by the Central Committee before the legislative process can be completed. The same is true for the Executive Yuan; its important policies must be approved by the Central Committee. Except for the Judicial Yuan, which is independent and the Central Committee does not interfere with judgments, the important affairs of all other Yuans must be approved by the Central Committee. Therefore, the current government is a one-power system. The five Yuans after the National Assembly will be very different from the current situation, and the powers of each Yuan will be more substantial than they are now. The future Legislative Yuan will be the highest legislative body. Except for laws initiated by the National Assembly, the Legislative Yuan can initiate any bill. Such a Legislative Yuan is virtually no different from the parliaments of Britain and the United States.</p>
<p>Presidential Powers</p>
<p>Fifth, regarding the concrete problems of the country, the president stipulated in the current draft constitution has two qualifications: one is the head of state, representing the Republic of China externally; the other is the chief executive, and the president of the Executive Yuan and the heads of various ministries will be responsible to the president in the future. The president has the power to directly command the administration. The ministers in the United States are responsible to the president, not to the parliament or the voters. The current draft constitution stipulates that the president is responsible to the National Assembly, which is equivalent to a presidential system. Some people criticize the draft constitution for granting the president too much power, but if we look at the regulations of the president in the draft constitution, the president's powers are exercised "according to law." The president only has the power to exercise the powers granted to him by law. The most vehemently opposed provision is Article 44 of the draft constitution, which stipulates the president's power to issue emergency decrees. In fact, the president must obtain the resolution of the Executive Yuan and submit it to the Legislative Yuan for ratification before issuing emergency decrees. As for the so-called excessive presidential power, this point may be studied, and other presidential powers are limited.</p>
<p>Local System</p>
<p>Sixth, the draft constitution did not have good provisions for the provincial system at that time. In recent years, we have also felt that the provincial-level provisions need to be supplemented. When the draft constitution was being drafted, the central government was focusing on centralization, gradually concentrating the powers of the local governments. The draft constitution did not stipulate that provinces have any public powers. The central government tells them what to do, and they do it. The financial power has also been centralized in the central government, and the budget has become a part of the central government's budget. This was justified during the War of Resistance Against Japan and achieved considerable results, enabling the central government to bear the financial burden during the war. In the future, during peaceful national construction, we feel that this should be corrected. Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings also clearly stipulate that the provincial governor should be elected by the people, but the draft constitution does not have this provision. Last year, the Constitutional Implementation Promotion Association studied the results, and everyone felt that this system should be changed. The status of the province should be redefined. On the one hand, it represents the state in the implementation of state laws, and on the other hand, the province is also a local autonomous body with its own affairs, restoring the ideal balance of power between the state and local governments. In addition, there are two points:</p>
<p>(1) The draft constitution does not mention military affairs or finance. Mr. Zhou Enlai said that the electoral system should also have principled provisions in the constitution. When the Legislative Yuan drafted it, there were special chapters on military affairs and finance. During the review, it was believed that this was a policy issue and should be changed according to the situation. If the constitution rigidly stipulates changes in the military service and national defense system, the constitution must be amended. Therefore, it was not included.</p>
<p>People's Freedom</p>
<p>(2) General scholars of the constitution say that the people's rights and obligations and the freedoms of the people stipulated in this reality have a sentence of "shall not be restricted except in accordance with the law." It is argued that these words should be removed. The freedoms stipulated are unconditionally guaranteed in peacetime. If there is a war against a foreign country, is the freedom of the people limited? Britain is the most liberal country, but in 1940, when France was about to collapse, Churchill organized a coalition government and proposed to Congress to authorize the requisition of manpower and materials. Capitalist countries attach great importance to the protection of property, but in wartime, they cannot but temporarily give it up. Many countries' constitutions unconditionally guarantee it, but when martial law is imposed, some articles of the constitution can be temporarily suspended. Since all countries have this precedent, will China adopt the method of suspending certain articles of the constitution by presidential decree when the constitution is implemented? We believe that the constitution is the fundamental law, and suspending certain articles of the constitution shakes the people's confidence in the dignity of the constitution. How can we avoid suspending the effectiveness of the articles and give the government the power to deal with the needs of the facts? The government must have a legal basis. The so-called law has two forms: one is formulated by the National Assembly, and the other is formulated by the Legislative Yuan, which is responsible to the National Assembly.</p>
<p>In short, the Five-Five Constitution may still have many doubts and shortcomings. The Kuomintang does not think that this draft is immutable and cannot be modified. What it hopes is that the Constitution of the Republic of China will be based on the highest principles of the Three People's Principles and implement the five-power system, on the one hand, to protect the people's exercise of political power, and on the other hand, to enable the government to execute state affairs. As for the generation, organization of the National Assembly, the powers of the President, the organization and operation of the five Yuans, those are technical issues that can be discussed, supplemented, and revised in the long term. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>French Democrat, General de Gaulle</h3>
<p>The results of the French general election proved the people's support for General de Gaulle and the policies of the Provisional Government. Undoubtedly, people have recognized him as the representative of public opinion. This general election can be regarded as a vote of confidence by French citizens in General de Gaulle, as well as an approval of the Provisional Government's national policies.</p>
<p>General de Gaulle gave women the right to participate in politics and allowed the public to decide the future organization of France, which has proven that he fully believes in democracy. When the work of the Constituent Assembly is completed and the Fourth Republic is formally proclaimed, French politics will take a step further, which will be closely related to the name of General de Gaulle.</p>
<p>All of this shows that General de Gaulle has proven himself to be a French democrat. (Temporary)</p>
<h3>A Commoner's Fair Words</h3>
<p>— Xu Muda</p>
<p>Dear Editor: I am now submitting an article, hoping your newspaper will publish it. I must ask you to pay attention to two things: (1) I have no connection with the Kuomintang or the government; I am purely objective in my research. (2) I wrote this article for no personal gain. I just feel that the will of us ordinary people is being oppressed by those clamorous and selfish individuals more than ever before! Every day I read the specious arguments in the Political Consultative Conference, and my blood boils! I don't know if</p>
<p>you, sir, can give me a chance to express my free opinions? Xu Muda, January 20th</p>
<p>(Reader's Opinion) The reasons why the existing National Assembly representatives should not be dismissed have been clearly explained by Mr. Sun Zhesheng, Mr. Chen Lifu, and others recently. However, their explanations are still mainly focused on legal principles, and because they stand in the position of the government and Kuomintang members, their statements are very moderate and reserved. I now stand on the position of a commoner, neither government nor Kuomintang, and from a factual point of view, I will thoroughly discuss the reasons why the National Assembly representatives should not be re-elected.</p>
<p>Those who advocate for re-election, whether in the Political Consultative Conference or outside, generally hold no more than four reasons:</p>
<p>Their first reason, perhaps the biggest one, is that the existing National Assembly representatives were elected in 1936 and 1937, and more than eight years have passed since their election, which is too long. This argument seems to be based on legal principles, and many people may find it very convincing. Mr. Sun and Mr. Zhang have already explained that these representatives are representatives for constitution-making, not for constitutional governance; they have a task but no term of office, so the government has no reason to remove their legal status. This is also a response from a legal perspective. Let's think about it from a factual perspective: Indeed, the National Assembly representatives should have been elected and then immediately carried out the task of constitution-making; they should not have delayed its execution for eight years. But why did they not carry out the task? Obviously, because China was invaded by Japan on a large scale shortly after the representatives were elected, the National Assembly scheduled to be convened in November 1937 could not be convened for eight years. So, the representatives' failure to perform their duties was not due to their own fault, but to the Japanese invasion. The greatest purpose of the Japanese invasion was originally to destroy our nation-building, so the national policy set by the National Government to carry out resistance and nation-building at the same time was to ensure that the Japanese purpose of destroying our nation-building could not be fully achieved, at least. With the victory of the War of Resistance, the National Government immediately decided to convene the National Assembly on May 5th of this year to formulate a constitution and implement constitutional government, which is to complete nation-building as soon as possible and start the restoration as soon as possible, so as to prove that the greatest purpose of the Japanese invasion has completely failed. Therefore, all those who are willing for our nation to complete the great cause of nation-building as soon as possible, and all those who are willing for the purpose of the Japanese invasion to completely fail, should actively support the National Assembly to convene quickly, and must not passively obstruct the convening of the National Assembly. If one says they want constitutional government, and at the same time uses the excuse that the National Assembly representatives were elected too long ago to obstruct the convening of the National Assembly, that is to delay the implementation of constitutional government even longer, which is to start our nation-building work even later, which is definitely not the will of our people, but rather to carry out the will of the Japanese invaders at the beginning of their invasion! Because re-electing the National Assembly representatives will take at least six months to a year, then we will not be able to see the promulgation of a constitution after May of this year. Isn't this deliberately making fun of China's constitutional government, and letting the people have a few more days of respite under "multi-party chaotic politics"?</p>
<p>The second reason for advocating re-election is that more than eight years have passed since the representatives were elected, and many factual changes in the meantime have made these representatives insufficient to represent the people. The factual changes they refer to are roughly of four kinds: (1) Many new political parties and factions have emerged in the country; (2) Some representatives have died or defected to the enemy; (3) Many meritorious people during the War of Resistance are not representatives; (4) Many young people have reached the age of voting, and they are not representatives. These many factual reasons, in fact, are none of them valid. As far as new political parties and factions are concerned, the government already has a way to take the facts into account, and is prepared to increase the number of representatives as a remedy, which can be considered quite thoughtful. Even without this method, why should the established election be overturned just because there are new parties and factions? Should the parties of a minority of people dominate the national election, and the election conducted by the legally ruling National Government be invalid? Furthermore, as for the representatives who have died or defected to the enemy, this will naturally not become a problem, because if a small number of people have lost their qualifications as representatives, we naturally have to find ways to replenish them, and no one can say that most of the representatives have died or defected to the enemy. As for whether those who have made meritorious contributions during the War of Resistance are representatives, this cannot become a reason either. The original purpose of electing representatives was to formulate a constitution, not to commend military achievements. Moreover, who are the meritorious contributors to the War of Resistance? The first, of course, are the soldiers who have been loyal and devoted to the cause. However, these sensible soldiers are the most law-abiding in China. They have done the most for the country, but they are the most retiring when it comes to politics. General Fu Zuoyi is a representative! Do these people who shout for democracy intend to incite "military domination" and use soldiers to make the constitution? Apart from soldiers, can those parliamentarian-style literati politicians who have been arguing endlessly in the rear for eight years, and are still arguing there today, also brazenly consider themselves to have made meritorious contributions in the War of Resistance? As for the growth of young people, that is also not a problem. Because after the National Assembly passes the constitution, according to the government's planned method, it will begin the election of the second National Assembly representatives, which is a good opportunity for young people to be elected. And we cannot say that just because there are newly grown young people, the old elected representatives should be overturned. All in all, all those who advocate re-election based on factual changes do not have sufficient reasons to prove that all representatives should be deemed invalid.</p>
<p>The third reason for advocating re-election is that the original election was not well conducted. Then we must ask, what does "not well" refer to? If it is said that the original election violated the law, then to overturn the election, factual evidence must be presented and legal action taken. If "not well" simply means that the original election was not perfect, then what can be considered perfect? Frankly speaking, we are originally a country without a foundation of civil rights. Even our most recent elections in the future may not be perfect. In fact, even countries with advanced civil rights cannot say that their elections are perfect. However, the election completed over more than a year in 1936 and 1937 did not have any major flaws or abuses, and is by no means comparable to elections in the warlord era. If someone casually uses the word "not well" to overturn this legal and established election, then that is trying to use an action without legal basis to overturn a fact with legal basis, and using the claims of a minority to overturn the will of the majority. There is nothing more undemocratic than this! Moreover, if we say that the original election was not well conducted, then can we have a better election now? We have experienced eight years of the War of Resistance, and most of the country has either suffered from war, been occupied, been divided by parties, or been ravaged by bandits. Therefore, today, people are either living in poverty, order is chaotic, or the people have lost their free will. These are all conditions unfavorable to elections. Let us put aside all legal issues and ask, can we deny these various conditions unfavorable to elections? If we cannot deny them, and yet insist on advocating for re-election and stubbornly pointing out that the previous election was not good, is this deliberately making trouble?</p>
<p>The fourth reason for advocating re-election is that the Kuomintang has too much dominance among the existing representatives. Many people have not said this reason, but in fact, it is a very important reason in their minds. If only the government's method of increasing the number of representatives is followed, the opposition fears that the Kuomintang's advantage can still be maintained, which is the real reason why they insist on re-election. I am neither a member of the Kuomintang, nor do I have any actual relationship with the Kuomintang or the government. I am just a commoner with few opportunities to speak. However, I think about it calmly: If the Kuomintang can gain an advantage in the National Assembly, what is not good for the country? I have two reasons to hope that the Kuomintang will have an advantage: (1) I believe that only the Kuomintang can sincerely uphold the Three People's Principles and the Five-Power Constitution. The task of this National Assembly is to formulate a constitution, and this task is extremely important to the future of the Republic of China. If the Kuomintang has an advantage in the assembly, then the future constitution will definitely conform to the Three People's Principles and the Five-Power Constitution. The draft constitution promulgated by the National Government, I believe, at least does not violate the Three People's Principles and the Five-Power Constitution. As for other parties, no matter how they say that the Kuomintang does not implement the Three People's Principles, I absolutely do not believe that these parties can truly abide by the Three People's Principles. If they abide by the Three People's Principles, they would naturally have joined the Kuomintang long ago, instead of following other principles and organizing other parties. Verbally, they also say that they do not oppose the Three People's Principles, or even that they are willing to fight for the Three People's Principles. In fact, they oppose the National Government's draft constitution, which means opposing the Father of the Nation, Mr. Sun Yat-sen's, Principles of Democracy and the Five-Power Constitution. This is undeniable. Since I am in favor of the Three People's Principles and the Five-Power Constitution, I naturally support the Kuomintang's majority. I cannot believe that we can create a better constitution without the Three People's Principles and the Five-Power Constitution. Therefore, I believe that whether the Kuomintang has a majority or not is greatly related to China's future. (2) Another reason why I support the Kuomintang is because the Kuomintang has a history of governing for twenty years. Moving from political tutelage to constitutional government does not necessarily mean that the country's politics must be taken from the Kuomintang and handed over to other parties or factions. In the constitutional period, the people must decide for themselves which party to elect. Just in terms of formulating a constitution, in addition to basing it on the principles of the Three People's Principles and the Five-Power Constitution, it must also be based on the experience of actually bearing the responsibility of politics. Weren't the major tasks of founding the Republic of China, overthrowing the warlords, laying the foundation for unification, and leading the War of Resistance all led by the Kuomintang? I cannot imagine that when it comes to formulating a constitution and implementing constitutional government to complete the great cause of revolutionary nation-building, the responsibility must be handed over to some parties with relatively lacking political experience, and even more so, I cannot imagine that the people must hand it over to some parties accustomed to making trouble. Those who oppose the Kuomintang can list many of the Kuomintang's faults, but those who oppose it probably don't even have the Kuomintang's ability! If they do, they are not young either, so why haven't they contributed to the country like the Kuomintang before? The Political Consultative Conference has held seven or eight meetings, and has completely exposed the emptiness and incompetence of those so-called parties! If the responsibility of formulating a constitution, such a major responsibility, is completely handed over to these people, the result would be truly terrible.</p>
<p>Based on the above criticisms, we know that we should not only passively oppose the proposal to re-elect the National Assembly representatives, but also actively support the first National Assembly to convene as scheduled. There are three benefits to convening as scheduled: (1) Constitutional government will be implemented sooner, politics will be stabilized sooner, and the start of restoration and construction will begin sooner. (2) Legal elections can be maintained and not overturned, which can increase the country's attention to elections and improve the country's concept of complying with laws and regulations. (3) Reduce the opportunity for disputes among parties and factions, so that the constitution deliberated and agreed upon according to the essence of the Three People's Principles and the Five-Power Constitution can be established as the fundamental law on which the permanent survival of the Republic of China depends.</p>
<p>There are also many self-proclaimed fair and impartial people who hold a appeasing attitude, thinking that it would not hurt to re-elect to quell party disputes. This so-called fair and impartial attitude is the hypocritical and peacemaking attitude, which is the most undesirable. If there is a reason to re-elect, then re-elect. If there is no reason, then absolutely do not re-elect. Election is such an important matter, and the will of the majority must never be forced to yield to the clamor of a minority! So this article is also standing on the position of the majority of voters, the position of ordinary people, protesting against those minorities who threaten the people with clamor. I firmly believe that the ability to extend the people's will is the main condition for the success of our constitutional government.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The National Assembly Should be Convened as Scheduled</h3>
<p>Since the convening of the Political Consultative Conference, it has generally been able to proceed in a harmonious atmosphere. Although no agreement has yet been reached on several important issues at hand, the fact that the meeting can always unfold in an atmosphere of coordination is enough to comfort the people's eager expectations. In previous meetings, according to reports, the discussions on the National Assembly and the draft constitution have been the most heated; and it is said that the distance between the opinions of the various parties is also relatively large. Regardless of the opinions of the various parties on these two issues, the heated discussions on these two issues are sufficient to show the attention of the various parties to these issues. In terms of nature, the National Assembly represents all the people and formulates the constitution for the long-term plan of China; the draft constitution is our fundamental law of the country, which is extremely important in relation to civil rights and the political system of the country. It is also comforting that the various parties have made heated discussions on these two issues. However, regarding these two issues, although the gentlemen of the Political Consultative Conference have each explained their positions and elaborated their high opinions, these two issues are of great importance to the interests of the Chinese people's future, and we, standing in the position of reporters, should also comment on the position of the people.</p>
<p>The issue of the National Assembly is actually a non-issue. The Chinese Kuomintang completed the unification of China through revolution, and after a period of political tutelage, it finally decided to return power to the people and implement constitutional governance. In May 1936, it promulgated the National Assembly Representative Election Law, and immediately put it into practice. Unexpectedly, the Lugouqiao Incident occurred the following year, triggering a full-scale war of resistance. The convening of the National Assembly was thus postponed due to this irresistible reason. Now that the War of Resistance has ended, the government has decided to convene the National Assembly on May 5 of this year. Once this National Assembly is convened and a constitution is formulated, constitutional governance can be implemented. Everyone is looking forward to democratic politics, so there should be no problem with this. Now, various parties have objections to this. To summarize their reasons, there are roughly several points: (1) Some of the National Assembly representatives were not elected by the people, but were appointed by the government; (2) The number of Kuomintang representatives attending ex officio is too large; (3) The representatives elected ten years ago may not be able to represent today's public opinion, etc. In addition, there are also some people who advocate for the nature of the National Assembly to not only make the constitution, but also execute it. If we make a thorough study of these issues, we will find that these debates are meaningless; to examine their intention, they merely want to make a problem that was originally not a problem become complicated, deliberately obstructing the government's realization of returning power to the people, extending the current political system, and opening the door to the division of power by various parties and factions. This is truly not the blessing of our people!</p>
<p>In the discussion on the National Assembly, we must pay attention to one fact, that the National Assembly Representative Election Law promulgated by the government in May 1936, and the representatives produced according to this law, cannot be canceled, and cannot be denied as valid. Although these representatives were produced ten years ago, their failure to fulfill their mission early was not due to the government's delay, or their own abandonment, but due to irresistible foreign aggression and war. Now that the war has ended victoriously, we absolutely cannot deny that they are valid. This is impossible in terms of law, reason, and sentiment. As for the argument that there are too many Kuomintang representatives ex officio, we cannot deny one fact that, up to now, China is under the rule of the Kuomintang, unified under the leadership of the Chinese Kuomintang, and won the victory of the War of Resistance, and the convening of the National Assembly is also organized by the government ruling under the Kuomintang, so it is natural for the number of Kuomintang representatives ex officio to be relatively large. Moreover, the percentage of Kuomintang representatives ex officio in the total number of assembly representatives is not too high, and the government intends to expand the number of representatives to include all parties and factions, so this point should not be deeply criticized. Furthermore, regarding the point that some representatives were not elected by the people but were appointed by the government, this was also due to an irresistible situation. For example, some of the representatives appointed by the government probably belonged to the Northeast region. At that time, the Northeast was under the control of the Japanese invaders, and elections were indeed impossible to conduct, so this expedient measure had to be taken. Although the rule of the Japanese invaders in the Northeast has collapsed today, the situation in various places is still unclear. The Northeast representatives appointed by the government came from the Northeast, so it should not be difficult to understand the general intentions of the Northeast people and represent the Northeast people in performing their duties. Therefore, the issue of the representatives of the National Assembly should not be regarded as a problem to be discussed. In addition to this, we have also heard people advocate for submitting the so-called issue of the representatives of the National Assembly to a poll. This sounds like a very beautiful phrase, but its implementation is also problematic. China's territory is so vast, the tools of transportation and communication are so rudimentary, and the people's level of knowledge is so low. How can we measure public opinion? What standard will the poll be based on? All of this seems to be somewhat irresponsible talk. If we talk about polling, we represent the people, at least a part of the people, and say that polling cannot be fully relied upon, especially in today's situation. Therefore, we dare to say that the representatives of the National Assembly should continue to be valid, and should not lose their representativeness due to the passage of time. The Christian Science Monitor, according to Reuters news, published an article on the National Assembly on the 20th of this month, saying: "Some experienced observers agree with the Chinese Communist Party's view that the National Assembly representatives took too long to produce and are not sufficient to represent general political intentions; but they also believe that re-elections at this time will not only cause a long delay in the convening of the National Assembly, but will also affect national unity, which is an extremely impractical thing to implement." This is indeed a very pertinent judgment and provides us with much food for thought.</p>
<p>As for the nature of the National Assembly, that is also a superfluous issue. The National Assembly Organization Law has provisions for this and should not be raised as a problem. Making the constitution and executing the constitution are two different things. Now we do not yet have a constitution, so the National Assembly is needed to formulate it, and when the formulated constitution will be executed is another issue, so the convening of this National Assembly is for making the constitution and not for executing it, which is also very clear in principle. After the National Assembly is convened and a constitution is formulated, the government should immediately implement constitutional governance and then convene the National Assembly regularly according to the constitution to return power to the people. Only in this way can we embark on the road to democratic politics. Today, the gentlemen of the Political Consultative Conference are gathered in the wartime capital, and should not think that they are carrying out reform and innovation, let alone think that they are carrying out a bloodless or preparing for a bloody political revolution, but are publicly and openly consulting on some current political issues within the political system established by the Kuomintang, under the recognized leadership of the Kuomintang and under the highest principle of nation-building by adhering to the Three People's Principles, and seeking further coordination after discussion. The National Assembly should not be a problem. After a long war of resistance, what the Chinese people want is stable order. In the effort to stabilize order, the Chinese people demand the National Assembly to be convened as scheduled, so that constitutional governance can be implemented as soon as possible, and China can truly embark on the road to democratic politics. As for what kind of political system we want after the implementation of constitutional governance, that is another issue.</p>

Bai stated, "During the Northern Expedition in the 16th year of the Republic [1927], I was the first to arrive in Shanghai. At that time, Shanghai still had concessions, and local governance was in the hands of foreigners. All of our armed soldiers were prohibited from entering the concessions. The situation was completely different from today. It is a great pleasure for me to be able to speak here today to the colleagues working under Mayor Qian's leadership. This is my first time in Shanghai since the victory of the War of Resistance. Seeing that the local order is stable and the governance is completely unified, it proves that the Chinese people can do their best to organize and gradually build up this great Eastern city. The future has infinite hope. My mission in Shanghai this time is to inspect the troops. Regarding the issue of military discipline, I believe that the military, police, and constabulary in Shanghai should pay close attention. Any transgressions by Chinese or foreign military personnel should be corrected immediately. Mayor Qian concurrently serves as the Commander-in-Chief of the Songhu Garrison, and he has full authority to handle this. Furthermore, the Army Headquarters has moved to Nanjing and can provide instructions at any time. It is imperative that the military and police cooperate to protect the safety of the people and maintain local order in Shanghai, which is connected to the perceptions of both China and foreign countries." After the speech, the ceremony concluded. Deputy Chief of Staff Bai then met with the directors and heads of various bureaus of the municipal government in the mayor's office and made some inquiries.</p>

<h3>Frozen US Dollar Funds Can Now Be Used</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] According to sources in the American banking community yesterday, there is now hope that the foreign exchange in this city that was previously frozen in the United States can be used. Importers in this city can use the frozen foreign exchange to purchase goods shipped from the United States to China. According to a person in charge of a foreign bank in this city, anyone holding frozen foreign exchange can directly apply to the American bank that issued the draft, and the bank will issue a postal money order to be sent to the payee in the United States. The payee will then submit a request to the US Treasury Department to unfreeze the funds. According to current procedures, after receiving the request, the US government will notify the Chinese Embassy in the United States to seek their opinion. After the Chinese Embassy expresses its agreement, the funds can be unfrozen and used. According to several people in this city who have already applied to unfreeze their funds, although the procedure is very complicated, under normal circumstances, most requests for legitimate commercial funds have been approved.</p>
<h3>Reasons for Overcrowding on Rice Transport Passenger Trains</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Passenger trains on the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou railways are still extremely crowded. Travel agencies require passengers to register and be assigned a number the day before purchasing tickets, and purchasing tickets at the station is also not easy. Passengers feel inconvenienced. A reporter visited the Railway Administration and learned that there are three reasons for the overcrowding: (1) Since the victory, the population of this city has been increasing daily. According to unofficial statistics, it has already reached more than 6.5 million people, and the need for transportation has naturally increased. The number of passengers taking the train each day is around 50,000. (2) The number of Hangzhou trains is limited, so it is impossible to increase the number of trains. Passenger cars are also extremely scarce and dilapidated. Each train currently has about 12 cars, and it is impossible to add any more. (3) Recently, prices have been rising sharply, and unlicensed peddlers have become active again. The transportation departments of the two railways are currently trying to convert iron plate freight cars into passenger cars to alleviate the urgent situation. Furthermore, the two railways currently have approximately 20,000 employees. Those who returned to their pre-war positions account for 70%. Since the takeover last year, the salaries of employees have not been officially determined by the Ministry of Transportation, so each person is temporarily paid a living allowance ranging from 7,500 yuan to 22,500 yuan. Ordinary employees, such as ticket inspectors and conductors, mostly receive 12,500 yuan. Although a temporary subsidy has recently been issued, the total monthly amount is still only over 30,000 yuan, and the treatment is relatively meager. It is heard that the authorities have decided to find a way to improve it.</p>
<h3>Second Victory Ship to be Received Soon</h3>
<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Haisu ship was officially taken over on the 19th, and the inventory was also completed yesterday. It is heard that there are plans to send the ship to the Beiyang route, but the earliest departure date will be next week. The second Victory ship, renamed Hai Zhe, will be received within this week.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Drama and Film Association Officially Established</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The Shanghai Drama and Film Association, which was prepared by Gu Zhongyi, Li Jianwu, Shi Dongshan, Fei Mu, Zhang Junxiang, Huang Zuolin, Yu Ling, Hong Mo, Chu Wen, and others, held its inaugural meeting on the 4th of this month. It currently has 174 members and is an important organization in Shanghai's cultural circles after the victory. The association has 19 directors, who were elected by the general meeting: Shi Dongshan, Fei Mu, Gu Zhongyi, Li Jianwu, Zhu Duanjun, Zhang Junxiang, Wu Zuguang, Huang Zuolin, Wu Renzhi, Yu Ling, Yu Wen, Xia Yan, Xiong Foxi, Song Zhidi, Cai Chusheng, Mei Lanfang, Feng Zi, Zhao Zhiyou, and Hong Mo. There are seven supervisors, who were elected by the general meeting: Luo Xuelian, Zhao Jingshen, Gu Yiqiao, Ge Yihong, Jin Shan, Shi Hui, and Shi Huafu. The alternate directors are Zhou Xinfang, Li Bolong, and Chen Xihe. The alternate supervisors are Chen Litin, Zheng Junli, and Cui Wanqiu. The first joint meeting of the directors and supervisors was held on the 17th of this month at Kang Le Restaurant. In addition to electing Fei Mu, Yu Wen, Gu Zhongyi, Shi Dongshan, and Yu Ling as standing directors and approving the appointment of Zhang Che as secretary, it was also decided to entrust Gu Yiqiao, Zhao Zhiyou, and Xu Wen to be responsible for resolving the issue of housing funds for the association's headquarters and the actors' guest house. Luo Xuelian, Feng Zi, Ge Yihong, and others formed a special committee to investigate collaborators in the film and drama industry. The association held its first meeting of standing directors on the afternoon of the 19th, at which Yu Wen was appointed as the director of the general affairs department, Shi Dongshan as the director of the organization department, Gu Zhongyi as the director of the academic department, and Fei Mu as the director of the service department. It was decided to hire Zhang Daofan, Pan Gongzhan, and Ma Xulun as honorary directors. Zheng Zhenduo, Ke Zhongping, and D.F. Gledhill as honorary members. Many important motions were resolved during the association's various meetings, such as: (1) To initially raise one million yuan in the shortest possible time to provide accommodation for homeless film and drama personnel coming to Shanghai and to relieve the poor and sick colleagues. (2) To jointly request all theaters and troupes to reduce film donation taxes to 20% and drama donation taxes to 10% in order to promote the development of the drama and film industries. (3) To issue a statement supporting the points made by Chairman Chiang in his opening speech at the Political Consultative Conference and the declaration guaranteeing the people's freedom, hoping to abolish the current system of censorship. Various motions related to the development of the drama and film industries and the research and improvement of drama and film art will be gradually implemented. The emergence of such a unified organization in the city's drama and film circles will surely unite everyone, align their steps, and not only will the film and drama industries achieve significant progress, but the entire cultural movement will also benefit greatly.</p>
<h3>China Industrial and Mining Bank Has Selected a Site for its Shanghai Branch</h3>
<p>The China Industrial and Mining Bank has been operating in the rear for many years. During the War of Resistance, it followed the national policy and did much to guide idle funds, promote industrial and mining enterprises, and assist. Now, in order to meet the needs of the government's rehabilitation, it is specially preparing to establish a branch in Shanghai. This has been approved by the Ministry of Finance. The bank's general manager, Zhai Wenqiao, and the Shanghai branch staff have arrived one after another. The bank has selected No. 9 Edward Road as its address and is actively preparing to open for business.

With strong capital and a well-established reputation, the opening of the Shanghai branch will surely make a great contribution to the community.</p>

<h3>High Court Trials Wu Liande, Requests Subpoena for He Junda and Mao Sen</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Wu Liande, 45, former manager of Liangyou Bookstore Company, a native of Taishan, Guangdong, joined a puppet organization in November 1944 and served as the director of the Hangzhou District of the Puppet Zhejiang Province Incense and Candle Tax Bureau until he left office in July 1945. After the victory, he was arrested by the Songhu Garrison Headquarters and sent to the prosecutor's office. After the facts were verified, a public prosecution was filed with the court. The case was investigated by Court President Liu Yugui in the Special Criminal Court of the High Court yesterday morning. The defendant stated in his defense that after the war, he worked as a manager at the Shanghai branch of Nanyang Bank and became acquainted with Zhang Haoran. In 1945, Zhang contracted the incense and candle tax in the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, and appointed himself as the "director." He asked me to help. At this time, because the bank had closed and I was persuaded and approved by my friend He Junda, I immediately agreed. He Junda was an intelligence officer in the Southeast Theater and wanted to use me as an outer-circle worker. Furthermore, he sent students to the interior. The incense and candle tax was contracted to merchants, and my role was to help, so it was different from holding a puppet position. After the victory, I visited Mr. Mao Sen, and Mao instructed me to assist in reporting traitors because I was familiar with the inside information of the puppet government. Unexpectedly, on October 19th of last year, I was arrested by the Garrison Headquarters for privately possessing enemy funds and prosecuted for treason. Therefore, I request the court to subpoena He Junda and Mao Sen to provide evidence. The case was adjourned for further questioning. The defendant applied for bail, and the court ordered that a petition be submitted and a decision would be made after deliberation.</p>

<p>Xu Hongsheng and his friend Wang Defu went to Cao Fenghao's home at No. 8, Lane 455, Jianguo East Road, at 8:00 PM on the 17th of this month.

<h3>Publishing Industry Hosts Press Conference Against Price Increase in Lead Printing Industry, Affecting Social and Cultural Development</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, the organizing committee of the Shanghai Book Industry Association hosted reporters from various newspapers at Xing Hua Lou Restaurant. Over 80 representatives and reporters from the Shanghai publishing industry attended. Representatives from 62 Shanghai publishing companies, including Commercial Press, Zhengzhong, Zhonghua, Dadong, Kaiming, Shijie, Children's, and Shenghuo, expressed their protest against the 100% price increase by the Lead Printing Industry Association and planned to petition the municipal government to request a halt.</p>
<p>Zhang Yiqu, manager of Eryi Bookstore, and Li Bojia, representative of the Commercial Press, first reported on the unreasonableness of the price increase in the lead printing industry. Zhang Pengzi, manager of the Writer's Bookstore, then vehemently described the impact of the price increase on the cultural sector, stating that the main costs of the lead printing industry had not increased, only the living expenses of workers had increased somewhat. However, in reality, the income of workers was still very limited, and the lead printing industry should not use the pretext of wage increases to raise prices.</p>
<p>Ye Suzhong, manager of Zhengzhong Bookstore, compared the printing situation in Chongqing, stating that the wages for typesetting and printing workers in Chongqing were roughly the same as those here at the end of December. However, other materials and books were more expensive in Shanghai. With the cost of lead printing here rising a hundredfold, the cost of typesetting and printing in Chongqing was half that of Shanghai, which was also unreasonable. The main raw material for printing is ink. Compared with before the war, the price of ink is now 800 times higher than before the war, while paper, the raw material for publishing, is now 8,000 times higher than before the war, yet book prices are only 600 times higher. Now that the prices of various commodities are falling, the printing industry alone is drastically increasing prices. Such a situation will inevitably lead to the closure of publishing houses, which will have a major impact on society and cultural development.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the publishing industry repeatedly suffered devastation during the war. Those who moved to the interior were constantly bombed by enemy planes, with each bombing destroying almost everything. The Battle of Guilin caused even greater losses to the cultural sector. Fortunately, with this victory, they reluctantly returned to work in order to contribute to cultural construction. Now, the printing industry is delivering a fatal blow first. This is tantamount to destroying the revival of Chinese culture. Therefore, we especially appeal to the media to help sanction this.</p>

<h3>Speculators Cautious: Gold Prices Begin to Fall, US Dollars and Hong Kong Dollars Also Decline</h3>
<p>Premier Song's arrival in Shanghai and his convening of meetings with the banking sector have made speculators uneasy. Major players repeatedly sold gold to buy stocks. Amid unsubstantiated rumors, small-time investors followed suit, reluctantly closing their positions. Trading was weakest at noon. Fewer spot transactions were made in the after-market. Deliveries for next-day settlement were stable due to purchases from Northern gangs. Morning prices remained steady, but the selling pressure was evident as stock market players sold gold to buy stocks. After opening at 932,000, prices gradually fell to 912,000, then leveled off. However, with Everbright and Maya performing better, the gold market paled in comparison. Holders lost interest and followed the lead of major players. The available supply became even looser, making it difficult to sustain prices. Finally, the 900,000 level was breached, and prices fell below 890,000 by noon. In the afternoon, Northern gangs came to buy for next-day delivery, resulting in minor increases. However, stock market players continued to push up Everbright while selling futures, resulting in steady and mostly sideways movement. In the end, gold fell 37,000 yuan compared to last Saturday, with ornamental gold at 96,000, silver ingots at 750, and silver dollars around 470 yuan. Demand was strong due to year-end holidays, with unofficial interest rates at approximately 10% to 12%.</p>
<p>The US dollar struggled to surpass 1,500 yuan and declined in tandem with gold. It opened at 1,490 yuan, with an arbitrage price of 625 yuan against gold, triggering arbitrage activity. As such, the US dollar did not decline as much as gold. It hovered around 1,450 yuan at noon. Due to hedging activity, the arbitrage price narrowed to 610 yuan per ten taels. The after-market was extremely flat, struggling around 1,455 yuan. In the end, the US dollar fell 33 yuan compared to last Saturday. Old Hong Kong dollars fell 12 yuan due to selling by Guangdong gangs. Small-time holders of new Hong Kong dollars panicked and closed their positions, leading to oversupply and a decline of 5 yuan.</p>
<h3>Everbright Rises Steadily with Support from Stock Market and Northern Gangs: Capital Flows into Stock Market, China Textile Also a Target</h3>
<p>Major players in the Chinese stock market returned to push up prices. Capital flowed from the gold market, attracting crowds of investors. Premier Song's arrival in Shanghai caused widespread panic in the gold and commodity markets, leading speculative activity to concentrate in the stock market. Everbright received preferential treatment. Major players in the stock market and Northern gangs deliberately pushed up prices, attracting retail investors and further depleting the available supply. However, due to some selling by Guangdong gangs, prices fluctuated around 1,600 yuan at one point. But the buying pressure seemed relentless, and Everbright ultimately closed at a high price at noon. Maya performed weaker, with high prices proving unsustainable. The Three Small Banks followed closely. Small-cap stocks found it more difficult to keep up. China Textile gradually attracted the attention of strong players, rising sharply from 500+ to around 650 yuan. Rumors circulated that one share would be converted into four shares, with a dividend of 100 yuan. Currently, China Textile, apart from Everbright, generated considerable profits, and its low base price made it extremely attractive. Once buyers launched an attack, capital rushed to buy. At noon, Everbright rose by a staggering 160 yuan compared to last Saturday, Xinyi by 40 yuan, Maya by 120 yuan, and the Three Small Banks by 3 yuan to 6.5 yuan each. Jingfu and Xinguang were close to breakeven. Major players continued to manipulate the market in the afternoon, with transactions in Everbright at 1,780 yuan and Maya at 1,130 yuan, but not widely.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks were subject to rumors, and traders did not publicly post prices. Buyers were extremely excited by the support from Chinese stocks, and the situation was very stable. At noon, popular stocks such as Yisha rose by half to one percent compared to last Saturday, while unpopular and rubber stocks showed little change.</p>
<h3>Bond Market Quiet</h3>
<p>The activities of major players in the bond market showed some restraint. Retail investors, wary of high prices, closed their positions and flocked to the stock market. Oversupply pushed prices below 1,600 yuan, retreating to 1,570 yuan. Later, customer gangs took advantage of the low prices to absorb inventory and briefly pushed prices to 1,710 yuan. However, miscellaneous bonds were extremely quiet, and under pressure, prices retreated to 1,580 yuan at noon. Prices hovered around 1,630 yuan at the noon close. Compared to last Saturday, Category A and B bonds fell by 150 yuan, Category C by 90 yuan, Category D by 160 yuan, and Category E by 150 yuan.</p>
<h3>Silk Trend Moderates: Rayon Weaving Orders Plunge by 100,000</h3>
<p>With the Lunar New Year approaching, credit gradually tightened. The market for rayon yesterday saw more selling than buying, and appeared to be moderating. The 120 Bridge opened at 1,350,000 yuan, falling to 1,300,000 yuan at closing. In the afternoon, prices rose slightly, quoted at 1,320,000 yuan, but transactions were rare. Sporadic transactions were inevitable for speculation. Yesterday, the market fell by 100,000 yuan, opening at 1,030,000 yuan, trading at 1,000,000 yuan mid-session. In the afternoon, someone sold at 930,000 yuan, but there were no buyers. Although inventory was limited, purchasers continued to come, and prices were relatively firm. Silk goods were mostly sluggish. Maya blankets were 750,000 yuan per hundred, Dachen crepe was 2,350 yuan per yard, and Minsheng brocade remained at last Saturday's original level, priced at 11,000 yuan per piece.</p>
<h3>Yarn Market Sees Heavy Selling Pressure, Cotton Transactions Mediocre</h3>
<p>The yarn market continued to weaken yesterday. From opening to closing, it was entirely dominated by selling pressure. This was because the selling price of the Textile Construction Company was reduced by 20,000 to 30,000 yuan, while customer sales stagnated, causing prices to decline sharply. Prices for all counts fell by approximately 30,000 yuan. Market sentiment was weak, and the trend lacked vitality.</p>
<p>In the spot cotton market, due to scarce arrivals, factories and cotton dealers inquired slightly. Transactions included Da Feng American fine lint cotton at 80,000 yuan, chicken-foot cotton at 62,000 yuan, Tongzhou cotton at 68,000 yuan, Yuyao cotton at 50,000 yuan, fire-machine cotton at 80,000 yuan, and Nanlu Taihui at 80,000 yuan (all prices are per 100 jin on the Sima scale).</p>
<h3>Small Lump Coal Sells Well</h3>
<p>Wholesale transactions in the coal market were quiet, while retail transactions were extremely brisk. Prices remained relatively stable. Among white coal, small lump coal sold more actively. White coal screened lumps and coal fines remained stable. Bituminous coal lumps continued to sell well, but the actual amount of goods flowing out was quite small. The market situation was very hot. Boatloads of firewood and charcoal continued to arrive. Recently, the number of retail vendors has increased, all adhering to the principle of small profits and quick sales. With the Lunar New Year approaching, household demand was strong, and sales were brisk.</p>
<h3>Grain Prices Continue to Rise</h3>
<p>Both Japonica and Indica Surpass the 10,000 Yuan Level</p>
<p>Rice prices in producing areas rose steadily, with stores selling out. Prices rose again. White Japonica rose by 300 to 400 yuan, customer Indica rose by 400 to 500 yuan, and glutinous rice also rose by 200 to 300 yuan. Flour from Nanyang moved slightly, while inquiries were made for flour from Beiyang. Prices on this street moved but were not strong, rising by another 100+ yuan. The oil market fluctuated. Soybean oil was scarce, rising by over 1,000 yuan. Raw oil rose slightly by 200 to 300 yuan. Soybeans were stable, falling slightly by 100 to 200 yuan. Sesame was similar. Raw kernels were weak downstream. Soybean cakes were mediocre. Wine sales remained brisk, rising by another 500 yuan.</p>
<h3>Timber Firm</h3>
<p>The timber market remained firm and strong. Due to the general price increases across the market, sellers followed suit. Prices of all goods rose on average. It was reported that Hangzhou timber was being shipped in by land. Currently, each tael was still selling for 47,000 yuan. Furthermore, small plywood factories in this city now have small poplar plywood for sale, selling for 75 yuan per square foot.</p>
<h3>Tea Exports Flourish Domestically</h3>
<p>Although international trade in black edged tea remains suspended, since the trade routes were opened, domestic sales in Tianjin, Guangdong, Qingdao, and Jiangbei have been brisk. Prices have also become increasingly firm due to buying and selling. Green tea in particular has been selling smoothly, leading to a resurgence of profits. The current situation is very solid, and the market outlook is promising.</p>
<h3>Customer Gangs Acquire Cotton Cloth</h3>
<p>The cloth market is stable. Sporadic transactions continue to occur. Sichuan, Hankou, and Changsha gangs are still buying light-colored goods, blue cloth, shirt poplin, and dye stuffs on dips. Fujian gangs frequently stockpile low-end goods of the local factory line. Products from the Tianjin factory in this city are favored, leading to slightly higher prices. Low-end men's line is also in this category.</p>
<h3>Trade with Taiwan Opens, Except for Tobacco, Alcohol, Matches, Rice, and Sugar. White Printing Paper Awaits Shipment.</h3>

<h3>Forced Conversion of Legal Tender Deposits to Puppet Currency to Be Reversed to Original Legal Tender Rate: Order from the Financial Special Commissioner's Office</h3>
<p>Regarding pre-occupation Legal Tender savings deposits and post-occupation Puppet Currency savings deposits in the recovered areas, the Financial Special Commissioner's Office of the Ministry of Finance in the Kyoto-Shanghai area has formulated three measures, as follows: (1) Legal Tender savings deposits received by banks in the recovered areas before the war, which were seized by the enemy and converted into Puppet Currency without any withdrawal by the depositor, should be converted back to Legal Tender at the original exchange rate for calculating principal and interest.

<h3>National Central Research Institute: Development of Wartime Achievements, Adds Three Institutes: Mathematics, Medicine, Etc., Botany and Zoology Research Separated into Two Institutes</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch from Nanjing] In order to restore operations, the National Central Research Institute has already dispatched Wang Zhongji, Director of the Institute of Zoology, to Nanjing to receive the General Institute in Kyoto, and other staff to receive the institutes in Shanghai. (Before the war, the Institute's Physics, Chemistry, and Engineering institutes were all located in Shanghai. Thereafter, the Institute of Medicine may be moved to Shanghai depending on the situation). Before the war, the Institute had ten research institutes for Physics, Chemistry, Engineering, Astronomy, Meteorology, Geology, History, Languages, Sociology, Psychology, and Animals and Plants. During the War of Resistance to Victory, research developed, expanding the research institute to 14. Now, the original animal and plant research institute is separated into two: animal research and plant research, and three new research units have been added for mathematics research, medicine research and physical anthropology research. Although these three are still in the planning stage, actual research work has already begun. The Institute's Nanjing buildings could not be fully utilized because of artifacts stored by the Cultural Relics Preservation Committee (General Institute in Kyoto located at Chicken Song No. 1), and most of the standard equipment and research supplies remained in the rear. Before the summer vacation, the General Institute in Chongqing may be fully restored in Kyoto. Currently, the President of the Research Institute is still Minister Zhu Liaoguang, and the Director General is Mr. Ben Dongjun.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Strictly Banned Enemy and Puppet Textbooks</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch from This City] President Chiang has recently issued a personal edict to the authorities and heads of the provinces and municipalities, stating that the enemy and puppet enslavement education has caused great harm to young people, and that concrete measures must be taken to implement the policy in order to maintain national life. After receiving the edict, the Nanjing Municipal Government took "re-education" as the center, and has clear provisions for teachers and textbooks. The Ministry of Education has learned that the enemy and puppet textbooks were printed in large quantities by the unscrupulous book industry's joint organization, the Pseudo-Chinese United Publishing Company, and had a deep impact. Even recently, in the Kyoto-Shanghai area, shameless people have openly sold and used them, which has had a great impact on education. The Ministry has reiterated its previous orders and sternly ordered all provinces and cities to conduct thorough investigations and bans in order to eradicate them. In addition, the Ministry has also sent another order to the textbook industry to strictly comply with the regulations. The following is the text of the Ministry of Education's instructions to Zhengzhong, Commercial Press, Zhonghua, Shijie, Kaiming, Dadong, Wentong, and other seven companies:</p>
<p>To the Joint Supply Office of National Standard Primary and Secondary School Textbooks, with Seven Companies: It has been found that all primary and secondary school textbooks in all provinces and cities should uniformly use the national standard books, which are supplied by the seven bookstores under the office. For those subjects and volumes for which the national standard books have not yet been published, it is permissible to temporarily select versions edited by the various bookstores in accordance with the current curriculum standards and issued by the Ministry after review or approval. The textbooks compiled and revised by the enemy and puppet regimes in the recovered areas were tools for implementing enslavement education and should be destroyed. The bookstores are not allowed to distribute them, and the schools are not allowed to use them. They have been ordered to comply. It is now reported that bookstores in the recovered areas are still selling pseudo-textbooks, and schools are still using pseudo-textbooks as teaching materials, which is inappropriate. The competent educational administrative authorities in each province and city should conduct strict investigations and bans, and punish bookstores that distribute pseudo-textbooks and schools that use pseudo-textbooks. However, the Office should supervise the seven bookstores under its jurisdiction to fully prepare and supply the national standard textbooks needed by each province and city, so as to prevent shortages. In addition to distributing the books separately, it is urgent to telegraph you to comply with the regulations.</p>
<p>The text of the Ministry's cable to the education bureaus in each province and city is also very stern. Schools in this city have attached great importance to this. It is said that all textbooks printed by the enemy and puppet regimes or that have been submitted to the enemy and puppet regimes for review and deletion will be reported and not allowed to be used.</p>
<h3>Students Studying in the United States Waiting for Ships to Go to the United States in Shanghai</h3>
<p>According to news from the education sector in this city, all of the students who won the Anglo-American scholarship last year and went to study in England have already arrived in London and are formally studying, but only 10 of the 41 students who went to study in the United States have arrived due to transportation difficulties. It is reported that one of them has died, and the other 30 have gathered in Shanghai, waiting for ships to go.</p>
<h3>Ginling Women's College of Chengdu to Move Back to Kyoto for Resumption of School in Summer Vacation</h3>
<p>Wu Yifang Talks in Kyoto</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Kyoto, 20th] Dr. Wu Yifang, Chairman of the National Political Council and President of Ginling Women's College, who attended the San Francisco Conference as a representative of China, returned to the country after resting in the United States for many months due to physical discomfort after attending the United Nations Conference in San Francisco last summer. She arrived in Kyoto on the 18th from Shanghai. According to her, the United States is now eager to restore all aspects of operation. Each university is also preparing to solve the problem of accommodating millions of demobilized soldiers. People do not want any more wars, especially in the atomic age, and they feel the importance of world peace and international cooperation. The problem of worker unemployment after the war is not as serious as imagined. Workers engaged in wartime industries have been quickly transferred to the consumer goods industry. Regarding the resumption of Ginling Women's College, Wu said that most of the school buildings in Kyoto have been severely damaged, and the school's instruments, books, and furniture have also been severely damaged, so it will be difficult to restore them to their original state. She will go to Chengdu and Chongqing in the next few days to discuss the matter. The Chengdu campus is expected to close by the end of May, and the campus will be moved to Kyoto in the summer vacation.</p>

<h3>The Passing of Master of Chinese Studies, Mr. Zhu Xiangwan</h3>
<p>Mr. Zhu Xiangwan of Yixing was a master of Chinese studies of his generation. He served as a professor at various universities, including Datong and Chengming. Throughout his life, he devoted himself to education. He possessed profound attainments in the field of elementary philology, second only to Zhang Taiyan.

In accordance with Mr. Zhu's wishes, no obituary will be issued, no gifts will be accepted, and no condolences will be received.</p>
<h3>Brief Reports</h3>
<p>Since the start of the school term, the public schools at all levels in Songjiang County have been relying solely on tuition fees for funding. However, the amount collected is very meager, with each teacher receiving only about 500 yuan per month. They are serving the public on an empty stomach, a truly pitiable situation. County Magistrate Huang, upon assuming office, recognized the need for improvement. Therefore, he is comprehensively planning the county's education budget and submitting it to the provincial authorities for approval. However, pending approval, he has specifically implemented temporary advance payment measures to maintain operations: (1) Each teacher and staff member will receive an advance of 5,000 yuan per month, and each school worker will receive an advance of 800 yuan per month. (2) For office expenses, county high schools will receive a monthly advance of 1,500 yuan per grade level, junior high schools will receive a monthly advance of 1,200 yuan per grade level, senior elementary schools will receive a monthly advance of 800 yuan, and junior elementary schools will receive a monthly advance of 500 yuan.</p>
<p>Alumni of National Beiping Normal University from Southeast China have initiated the organization of an alumni association.

<h3>Second Act of the Basketball League: Blue Team Loses to Giants; Women's Green Team Easily Defeats Qinglian; Green Forest Defeats Zhongyi in Another Match</h3>
<p>The inaugural basketball league continued last night with its second act. The audience at the City Sports Hall was quite numerous. The results of the three matches are as follows:</p>
<p>The first match was in the women's division, between the women's champions, the Green Team, and Qinglian. Although the Green Team had lost Yan Weiwen, Wang Yinlan and others due to marriage and departure, they still had ample talent. Qinglian naturally struggled to compete. The score was 19-7 at halftime, and the final result was 37-18, with the Green Team winning decisively.</p>
<p>The second match was in Group A2, between Green Forest and Zhongyi. The latter team consisted of former famous players such as Hu Guocheng and Li Jiazhi, but they had been out of practice for a long time. From the start of the game, Green Forest gradually took the lead. Chen Guozhen scored under the basket, a beautiful sight to behold. The score was 21-12 at halftime, and the final score was 56-26, with Green Forest leading throughout.</p>
<p>The third match was in Group A1, between the Blue Team and the Giants. The Giants had Carson to assist them, but he had also been out of practice for a long time. However, his speed and his commanding presence were still impressive. The score was 15-12 at halftime, with the Giants leading. In the second half, Jin Kun scored first, and the situation became tense. The Blue Team's Jin Changchun and Jin Kun frequently made skillful shots, and they took the lead with a score of 20-15. However, the Giants then surpassed them with a score of 24-23, and the Blue Team ultimately lost a close game with a score of 27-30.</p>
<h3>Morning Friends Cup: Muer Wins Championship in Group B Friends Section</h3>
<p>Liangxi Hualian Wins in Group A</p>

Liangxi won with a score of 21-17 at halftime and won by only one point with a final score of 39-38. In the third match in Group A, Hualian V Team led 39-20 at halftime, and the final score was 59-25, with Hualian leading throughout.</p>

<h3>Introduction to National Oriental Language College</h3>
<p>— Guo Weiying</p>
<p>National Oriental Language College was born during the arduous and difficult period of the War of Resistance, in response to the urgent needs of the nation's current situation. Therefore, it bears an exceptionally important mission. This school was originally located in Chenggong, Yunnan, and only moved to Chongqing last summer upon the order of the Ministry of Education. The current temporary location is in Xinkai City, 20 kilometers from Chongqing. The environment is very good, adjacent to Chairman Chiang's official residence and near the cemetery of the late Chairman Lin. It is secluded and quiet, making it a good place for studying. Because it will move east to Nanjing this spring, the facilities are very simple, with only a few thatched huts as school buildings. The school's president has already flown to Nanjing to survey the school site. In order to complete the curriculum and prepare for the move to the east as soon as possible, there will be no winter vacation this year, and the school will return to the capital in mid-April.</p>
<p>The internal organization of the Language College is divided into five departments: Indian, Burmese, Siamese, Vietnamese, and Malay. The curriculum is the same as that taught in general universities, busy and intense. The professors are mostly well-known figures and authoritative scholars in the country, some of whom also hold positions at National Central University, Fudan University, or the Central Political Institute. The students, like those in other schools, come from all over the country. The relationships between the students are very harmonious, and the atmosphere of learning and research is also very strong. Among the two graduating classes, some have gone overseas to engage in overseas Chinese affairs, serving the motherland and the overseas Chinese. In the near future, we will see the footprints of Language College students all over the East.</p>
<p>Life in the Great Rear Area is difficult, and the lack of material conditions is distressing everywhere. There are no textbooks for classes, and students rely mostly on handouts and notes. The library's collection is not very rich. Recently, a large number of books were purchased from India, but it is still not enough. There are no electric lights at night, and five or six people huddle around a dim kerosene lamp to study. The students here are all on public funds, which alleviates the burden on many poor students. They understand the government's painstaking efforts to cultivate young people and are also aware of the great responsibility they bear themselves, so everyone is working hard to study diligently.</p>
<p>The extracurricular activities of the Language College students are also very active. Although they are liberal arts students, they do not neglect physical exercise, so there are often healthy and beautiful people on the sports field. The student self-government association is responsible for the welfare of the students and organizes a cooperative and academic lecture series, among other things. There are also more than a dozen kinds of wall newspapers. There are also several small academic groups, such as the English Learning Association and the Oriental Society, which have made outstanding contributions. They often hold "evening parties" and "symposiums" to help make up for the deficiencies in classroom learning.</p>
<p>We know that many other countries also have Oriental schools that specialize in the study of Oriental affairs. They attach great importance to them, and China, which is located in East Asia, should not ignore them. In order to keep pace with the Oriental universities or colleges in other countries, the Ministry of Education has in principle agreed to consider the issue of upgrading the school to a college after moving to Beijing. So now it is only a matter of time. I believe that the future Oriental Language College will have a bright future. In addition to our own efforts, it also requires the attention and supervision of the broad masses of people throughout the country. (Sent from Chongqing on January 18)</p>

<h3>Chinese Scientists, Organize Yourselves!</h3>
<p>— Bao Shixi</p>
<p>News of the Soviet Union's invention of a new type of atomic bomb has been met with skepticism by circles close to the British government. Regardless of whether the Soviet Union has indeed invented a new type of atomic bomb, its painstaking research on this matter is evident. Consider the Soviet Union's past "Five-Year Plans," completed one after another, and the new "Five-Year Plan" that has begun, emphasizing the development of various industrial sectors. Their scientists are all working diligently, truly embodying the spirit of "dedicating themselves heart and soul until their last breath." And the government authorities provide them with spiritual encouragement and material assistance. Their success is not accidental. Looking back at China, what do we see? The state of the scientific community is desolate, and there is much that is unsatisfactory. It's not that we lack scientific talent; the problem is the lack of organization, funding, and encouragement. Individual strength is limited, and the strength of social organizations is also limited. As a result, the scientific community cannot be invigorated, cannot concentrate, and cannot make inventions or contributions. Thus, we lag behind, and we cannot even talk about "atomic energy," let alone the atomic bomb.</p>
<p>"Sleeping Beauty" of East Asia, wake up! "Talented scholars and beautiful ladies" and "romantic affairs" are no longer relevant in today's atomic age. They are becoming the dregs of a progressing world.</p>
<p>If we do not "catch up" and strive for national scientific advancement, research new types of weapons, organize an "atomic" research society, and engage in a scientific struggle for "resurrection," we will inevitably face the threat of survival directly or indirectly, or be eliminated.</p>
<p>We must not rely on others today. The assistance of allied nations should be deeply appreciated, but it is not something we can depend on. (Of course, we must utilize the capital, materials, and talents of others to engage in national reconstruction.) However, we must recognize the proverb "Heaven helps those who help themselves." The best approach is to "return and weave a net" rather than "admiring fish from the edge of the pond." We must "rely on our own efforts," and we must work diligently. But "to do a good job, one must first sharpen one's tools." First, we must have organization, funding, encouragement, a well-equipped scientific research society, and excellent equipment and supplies, in addition to hardworking talent. With these prerequisites, given time, can't China produce new "atomic" inventions?</p>
<p>Today, countries in Europe and America are engaging in large-scale coordination and expansion of scientific research institutions. Can China, a country lagging behind in science, still stand by and watch without urgently seeking to catch up?</p>

<h3>Chongqing Snippets</h3>
<p>— Mei Youyun</p>
<p>Since the tenth, Shangqingsi has become a focal point, bustling with activity. Here, the fate of China will be decided at the Political Consultative Conference. All peace-loving people in China and around the world are earnestly and nervously hoping that it can become a memorial site for the generation of peace.</p>
<p>A certain gentleman wrote a jingle describing the life of cultural figures in the rear area over the past eight years:</p>
<p>"Everyone calls me a pedant,</p>
<p>My life is worse than a wet nurse's.</p>
<p>Both take care of children,</p>
<p>Neither starving nor overfed."</p>
<p>This pedant who wants to be "overfed" is somewhat lacking in common sense.</p>
<p>Recently, American films have disappeared from Chongqing's cinemas. Most of what is shown are Indian and domestic films. With the exception of the China-made "Song of the Police Soul," which was once packed, business is generally slow. The stage play has quietly increased its box-office record. The currently playing "Peacock Screen" and "Year-End Picture" are both very popular. Zhang Guang of the China Victory Theater Company is also rushing to rehearse Yang Hansheng's famous play "Outlaws," preparing for a Spring Festival performance. The cast is quite well-organized, and it is expected that the Youth Hall will once again be bustling.</p>
<p>There are "gangs" for fetching tap water, and there is a black market for buying movie tickets. Ordinary people without "gang" connections who line up to fetch water are often snatched from the front by those in the "gang" when it is their turn. The police can only stare and dare not interfere. When the movies are good, people who queue up in an orderly manner to buy tickets often have the good fortune of being told "sold out" when they finally reach the "window." Although these are two small matters, they easily discourage those who are law-abiding and encourage those who are not. If we want to reform the bad habits of society, we should start with these small things.</p>
<p>Parks built on slopes are a feature of this mountain city. Recently, with the winter sun shining brightly, the long, sloping lawns and the riverside tea houses have become places of recreation for people. Sipping tea by the river, talking intimately in the mist. Although it cannot compare with Xuanwu Lake in Nanjing or Zhongshan Park in Beiping, it has its own charm.</p>
<p>A few days ago, when the Chongqing District Court was in session, one of the parties referred to the judge as "Lord" and the female court clerk as "Madam." Would you believe that a citizen of the wartime capital in the 33rd year of the Republic would make such a joke?</p>
<p>Profession</p>
<h3>Darkness Often Appears Before My Eyes</h3>
<p>— Ge Shangde</p>
<p>Darkness often appears before my eyes, an endless darkness.</p>
<p>Education is not a career that can be undertaken casually. Without a solid economic foundation, education, which is called a noble career by people, cannot take root, blossom, bear fruit, or reap beauty. Not only can it not reap beauty, but sometimes it can even produce unexpected evil consequences.</p>
<p>The school building is a rather beautiful private residence, which the school authorities have rented with great effort. A "private residence" is, after all, a private residence, and its conditions do not meet the requirements of a "school building." There is no playground here, and the only place for the nearly one hundred boarding students to do morning exercises is a narrow rooftop. Although the classrooms are not too narrow, some classes accommodate too many students, who are squeezed so tightly that they are like sardines in a can. When school started, parents insisted on sending their children to school despite the school's strong rejection, on the grounds that other schools were also full, so the school authorities should not bear this responsibility alone.</p>
<p>Every time I step into the classroom and see the tightly packed "sardines," I am discouraged and cannot muster the enthusiasm to teach.</p>
<p>The lack of spacious school buildings cannot restrain the students' active nature; on the contrary, precisely because there is no suitable place to play, they become more active. Roaring and jumping constitute a scene of commotion. No matter how well-trained a teacher is, it is not easy to "suppress" this commotion.</p>
<p>The disciplinary office is full of "rule violations." Sometimes I cannot help but reach out my trembling hand, stroking the heads of the students who have been "reprimanded," with tears in my eyes.</p>
<p>At the present stage, Shanghai is full of alley schools and "canned" classrooms like this. For two years, I have stepped onto the platforms of two universities, and for even more years, I have stepped onto the platforms of even more middle schools, and I have found that all those in front of the platforms are "sardines."</p>
<p>Kind-hearted people will surely sigh for the "sardines." But what causes kind-hearted people to sigh is surely not just the "sardines."</p>
<p>The four words "wearing clean sleeves" cannot describe the current plight of teachers' lives. The meager salary is not enough to cover one's own food, clothing, housing, and transportation: clothes and shoes are worn and torn; seeing the large pots of mixed beef and beef intestines that laborers are feasting on in the streets, one cannot help but drool; housing is a small pavilion room, squeezing the entire family; transportation relies only on the eleven-number automobile bestowed by the Creator. As for supporting one's parents and raising one's children, ah! How can one talk about supporting one's parents and raising one's children?</p>
<p>Although sometimes lying is a virtue, one cannot lie often, and this method will lose its effectiveness if used too often. My wife, who has been frowning and crying for more than ten years since we got married, often "joyfully" "pester" me.</p>
<p>"Did you bring the money?"</p>
<p>"I didn't bring it today." After saying that, I would remain silent. Or: "I only brought this much today." I would say, busy fumbling in my pocket. Then: "I can bring more next month, a lot, I'll give it to you." I would say, feeling proud of myself. In fact, I am spending tomorrow's money today, so I am not as good as those traveling boxers when it comes to "bragging."</p>
<p>Walking home from school, passing by the Bund, I would always stop and stare sadly at the endlessly flowing river for a long, long time.</p>
<p>The function of education is undeniable, but it is really not easy to maintain "confidence" in the education career at the present stage.</p>
<p>Darkness often appears before my eyes, an endless darkness.</p>
<p>Clothing</p>
<h3>The Changshan Can Be Reformed</h3>
<p>— Rong Huilan</p>
<p>I remember that before the war, someone advocated for the abolition of the changshan, which attracted a lot of attention at the time. Unfortunately, the advocacy did not last long, and the war broke out, so no one mentioned it again.</p>
<p>Now that peace has been initially established, victory belongs to us, and construction is just beginning, everything needs to be reformed and improved. Clothing, food, housing, and transportation are the four necessities of life, with clothing being the most important, so naturally it should be constructed and perfected in accordance with the principles of the new life. Looking back at our country since the founding of the Republic, there has been no standard and reasonable national costume. Although the late Premier Sun Yat-sen created the Zhongshan suit, it has not become widespread, and now even fewer people wear it, which is a pity!</p>
<p>As for the changshan, I think it is nothing more than costing more money to buy, taking more effort to make, and being inconvenient to wear. Other than that, it seems to have no special features. Look at those who wear the changshan, they must lift it up in the front and back when getting on and off vehicles and going up and down stairs, or when encountering wet and muddy roads. If they are not careful, it will be soiled or torn.</p>
<p>Some people say that wearing the changshan is to protect against wind and cold, which seems reasonable. But why do you still have to put on a changshan in the hot summer? If it is to be dignified, isn't the round-necked, wide-sleeved clothing of the Ming Dynasty more dignified? Besides, what is undignified about the Zhongshan suit? Moreover, the changshan, which Northerners call dagua, is a Manchu ceremonial dress that is worn on top of other clothes, so it is also called waigua or wai tao, and is a Manchu garment similar to the cheongsam. Therefore, the changshan can really be abolished today.</p>
<p>This construction, in a broad sense, is about promoting what is beneficial and eliminating what is harmful. Therefore, although this starts with the changshan, it further says that all unreasonable clothing should be thoroughly reformed. A standard and reasonable national costume should be constructed based on the principles of simplicity, plainness, practicality, convenience, and grandeur, so as to fully demonstrate the great spirit of the Yellow race. As for how to improve it, this naturally depends on the advocacy of powerful people and the design of experts. I am just throwing out a brick to attract jade.</p>
<p>National Conditions</p>
<h3>China's Industrialization</h3>
<p>— Bao Zhongzuo</p>
<p>For centuries, the working efficiency of our handicrafts has been severely diminished, so the government is currently planning to implement a nationwide five-year industrialization plan to replace Japan and become the industrial authority of the Far East.</p>
<p>In order to assist our country in implementing this plan, the United States has sent the President's personal representatives to our country twice to inspect the economic situation, and plans to lend us huge sums of money to provide us with technicians and materials.</p>
<p>The Chinese government still has to overcome various difficulties, such as lack of transportation, lack of machinery and technicians, and basic economic problems such as domestic inflation.</p>
<p>After the implementation of the industrial plan, our country will be able to manufacture its own telephones, telegraphs, railway equipment, freight cars, bicycles, light bulbs, glass, cotton and woolen textiles, canned foods, rubber, and refrigerators and their accessories.</p>
<p>An industrialized China will not only improve the living standards of the people, but also become a country that does not owe foreign debt.</p>
<h3>Requirements for Cultivating Modern Youth</h3>
<p>Qu Shen</p>
<p>In a certain youth academic speech, Mr. Lin Handa specifically raised the question of how to be a modern youth. He believed that every modern youth should possess at least the following points:</p>
<p>Optimism—Maintaining an optimistic spirit even in the face of difficulties.</p>
<p>Humor—Cultivating a habit of humor in helpless situations.</p>
<p>Democracy—Not just talking about it, but expressing the spirit of democracy in daily life.</p>
<p>Foolishness—Most scientific inventions and social reforms are created by "fools."</p>
<p>Targeting reality, we can find many young people today holding pessimistic arguments, speaking with a stern face, adopting autocratic styles, and engaging in some foolish acts.</p>
<p>Social Service Benefits Students Receiving Aid</p>
<p>Examination Results for Trainee Staff Announced</p>
<p>Students Admitted Expected to Report for Duty on the 23rd</p>
<p>Our newspaper's recruitment of four trainee staff and nine trainee students has been completed. Trainee staff require a university education, while trainee students require a high school education. This recruitment was limited to students receiving aid from our newspaper's scholarship fund, as they are all outstanding students from various schools with financial difficulties. They have been cultivated by the enthusiastic support of various sectors of society over the years and carefully selected by our newspaper. Many of them are unable to continue their education due to difficult family circumstances and are eager to find employment. Therefore, our newspaper is giving these students employment opportunities. Prior to this, our newspaper convened a meeting with aided students with high school education or above, encouraging them with the essence of serving society and assessing their service methods and abilities. From over 600 people, more than 70 were initially selected. On January 12th, the examination committee conducted a selection test in the auditorium of this newspaper. In the morning, mathematics, English, and Chinese were tested, and in the afternoon, individual oral tests were conducted. As a result of the evaluation, Zhao Liangfu, Wang Junkang, Ruan Rongxing, and Zheng Rongzhen were selected as trainee staff, who will be promoted to formal staff after one year of internship. Song Zhigang, Zhang Qingqi, He Shoufa, Fan Yongkang, Liu Cheng, Gan Yurui, Zheng Yilong, Zeng Buren, and Sun Yu were selected as trainee students, who will be promoted to formal staff after three years of internship. With the approval of our newspaper's authorities, all students are expected to report to the personnel department on the 23rd to complete the entry procedures and work conscientiously, without delay.</p>
<p>Reply to Readers' Questions</p>
<p>Inquiry About Architect Registration</p>
<p>Dear Editor: I deeply admire your enthusiasm for answering the difficulties of the public. Now I have a matter that requires your trouble to reply:</p>
<p>I studied architecture and had a registration certificate before the war. After the outbreak of the war, I stopped working. Now that victory has come and the country has been restored, construction is the top priority and it is time to develop. I want to reorganize my old business, but I have some questions, listed below: (1) Can the registration certificate from before the war be reused? (2) If the old registration certificate cannot be used, where is the competent authority for applying for registration? (3) What are the procedures?</p>
<p>Sincerely, Jin Guang</p>
<p>(Answer) The old registration certificate from before the war is not applicable. You can use this certificate to re-apply for a new certificate from the Municipal Bureau of Public Works on Jiujiang Road. There are prescribed procedures, please go there for a face-to-face consultation.</p>
<p>Inquiry About Job Introduction Procedures</p>
<p>Dear Editor: I have always admired your newspaper's social service column as the mouthpiece of the public. Now I have a question, please disclose it in the hope. The reader previously read the news of the Social Department's Job Introduction Office in your column, but if you want to take the exam or apply for recruitment, should you first register with the Social Department's Job Introduction Office? Or are there other procedures? What is the address of the Social Department's Job Introduction Office? Please give a detailed answer in your newspaper, so that the unemployed can know the details. Sincerely, Reader Zhang Ji</p>
<p>(Answer) If the office is looking for talents, you can go to apply, but you must ask yourself whether you are qualified? It is also possible to register in advance. If you need to recruit talents, you can also entrust them to handle it. The office is originally a service agency entrusted by both parties, and the address is 856 North Sichuan Road.</p>
<p>Inquiry About Automobile Driving School</p>
<p>Dear Editor: I have heard that there is an "Automobile Driving School" in Shanghai, but I don't know if it is still open? I have the ambition to learn, so I sent a letter to your publication to inquire, hoping to see your answer.</p>
<p>Sincerely, Zhang Zuyin</p>
<p>(Answer) We have not heard of the establishment of such a school at present.</p>
<p>Chiang Kai-shek's Military Manuscripts</p>
<p>Donation of Half of the Proceeds from Charity Sale</p>
<p>Respected Sirs: Your newspaper's scholarship movement benefits students who have dropped out of school, which is no small matter. I am a poor scholar who usually relies on writing for a living. I would like to donate, but my heart is willing but my strength is lacking, which is a regrettable thing! In order to respond to your newspaper's scholarship campaign, I will donate two sets of the treasured lithographic "Chiang Kai-shek's Military Manuscripts" (each set is four large volumes bound with thread), to your newspaper for charity sale, each set is 50,000 legal tender, half of which will be donated to the scholarship fund. If you agree, please publish this letter in the service column and hope to reply, so that I can send the original book. To the Social Service Column of Shen Bao. Jiang Zhiping</p>
<p>(Note) Mr. Jiang's enthusiasm for helping students and benefiting the poor is deeply admired. Please send the two famous works to this office for charity sale, and those who intend to purchase books to help the good are asked to come to the office or contact us by letter within five days.</p>
<p>Lost and Found</p>
<p>Overdue Items to Be Used as Scholarship Funds</p>
<p>(I)</p>
<p>Dear Sirs: A few days ago, a bather in our bathroom lost a gold ring in the pool. Because the pool was large and the water was deep, it was difficult to find it for a while. We explained to the guest: "We will release the pool water after closing and pay attention to finding it. Please ask the accounting room tomorrow if it has been found." That night, the water was released, and a gold ring was found in the pool. It is now kept in the accounting room, waiting for the guest to pick it up. Unexpectedly, the guest has not returned for many days. Because we do not know the guest's name and address, we cannot return it. In order to return the item to the original owner, we hereby send a letter to your newspaper's social service column, hoping that the bather who lost the ring will come to claim it. Those who can describe the weight, style, and brand of the gold ring can take it back from our accounting room. The deadline is the end of this month. If you do not come after the deadline, the gold ring will be sent to your newspaper to donate to the scholarship fund for charity. Sincerely, Anle Pool Bathhouse, Yunnan South Road</p>

<p>Dear Sirs:</p>
<p>I picked up a golden wooden fish on the 17th of this month at 11:00 AM. It weighs four fen and is probably lost by a customer. I hereby send it to your column for publication and claiming, with a limit of five days. Overdue items will be donated to the scholarship fund. Zheng Xinzhang, Mingfeng South Goods Store, 404 North Henan Road</p>
