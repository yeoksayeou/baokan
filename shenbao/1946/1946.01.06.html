<p>〔合衆社重慶五日電〕軍界人士謂：蔣委員長以現金作新年禮物，給與現駐東北之第十三軍與第五十二軍，以及現駐平津之第九十二軍與第九十四軍官兵，據稱：軍官每人二千元，士兵每人一千元。</p>
<p>〔中央社長春五日急電〕我首批空運部隊，今午由平飛抵長春，此爲歷史上空運大批國軍至東北之開端，後續部隊將陸續飛來。</p>
<p>〔合衆社北平五日電〕自此問權威方面獲悉：國軍空運東北，於今晨開始，杜聿明將軍所部保安軍第二旅，乘運輸機雕平，飛往長春。牟廷芳將軍所部第九十四軍，預料一二日內，亦將自天津一帶啓程前往。</p>
<p>〔中央社錦州四日電〕杜長官接蘇聯駐　軍官電報後，即決定派遣設營組，前駐瀋陽，並派彭副軍長璧生爲設營組主任。彭氏偕參謀，秘書，及隨員等四十一人，於四日晨由錦乘車，前往瀋陽。</p>
<p>〔又電〕杜長官聿明，今晨乘專車沿義縣，淸河門，向阜新縣視察。</p>
<p>〔中央社漢口四日電〕東北保安副司令長官梁華盛將軍，率領幹訓團人員，由昆經湘，於二日到漢。</p>
<p>〔聯合社北平五日電〕東北情形今日又趨複雜，一部份省市接收官員，雖繼續離平前往東北就任，但軍隊主力之移動，仍受阻碍，僅有一縱隊自義縣開往復縣。此間感覺，中蘇談判次一階級，非俟駐蘇特派員蔣經國自莫斯科歸來報告任務後，不能決定。</p>
<h3>魏德邁在記者會上稱　助我運軍赴東北　新六軍週後由水路運瀋陽</h3>

<p>戰後美軍出售軍用品與中國之辦法，現仍由雙方政府進行商討中，魏將軍謂其本人現不能發表任何意見。軍用品列爲剩餘物資者，乃由其宣佈，惟以後一切實施權，富屬於美軍剩餘物資委員會。　美政付或將有六自由輪交與中國政府，其使用全權，乃歸中國政府。惟目前最急需者爲運煤問題，如本市工廠復工，亟需大量煤斤，靑島每月亦需煤約一萬五千噸。</p>

<p>某記者問魏將軍對於美軍在「星條報」上所載攻擊美軍總部工作之文章，作何感想。魏將軍答：余喜歡此類文章。此乃極好機會，使彼等可自由發表意見。余亦歡迎各方批評，祗要是積極性者。余同時亦接獲極多美軍士兵及官長致余私函，贊成並感激余所施工作，但余不願以此發表，蓋攻擊之文章往往能引人注意耳　關於前次霞飛路美軍用卡車壁事慘案，魏將軍至今尚未獲得其他報告。魏將軍承認此爲美軍卡車，惟本市尚有同類車四百輛四十輛，由聯合國善後總署及中國軍隊使用者。</p>
<p>陳納德將軍何時來華，魏將軍尚未獲悉，如陳將軍以官方之身分來此，則其本人必可得到美政府及蔣主席之通知。</p>

<h3>廣州片段</h3>
<p>— 梁風</p>
<p>〔本報廣州航訊〕聽說南京·昆明·漢口等地都已飄驟，但廣州却祗如春天一樣；除了早晨和晚上要穿大衣，中午就一件夾袍子便够了！在重慶·貴陽等地回來的人們，無不感覺到南國的天氣委實可愛。</p>
<p>同是一個聖誕節，但廣州和香港情形却大不相同。據港報載：「各電影院·舞塲無不利市三倍，各大酒家餐室顧客如雲，紅男綠女，摩肩接踵，熱閙情形，爲戰後所罕見……」而這裏呢，除了一班上帝的兒女們在禮拜堂唱唱聖歌，和三幾個顯貴人家舉行私家舞會以外，市面沒有半點聖誕節日的景象。大槪這裏的同胞們，還沒有幾個和聖　老人認識吧！</p>
<p>「食在廣州」這句話，似乎有兩個解釋：一是廣州以食品種類多而且講究。而另一個解釋，說廣州人好食，也未曾沒有理由。最近節約委員會據可靠方面調查統計：目前社會人士在茶樓酒樓每日的飲食消耗，總數在五千萬元以上，每月的十五萬萬元，其中十分之四乃屬過往民衆之消耗，十分之六乃屬本市民衆之無謂消耗云云。照這樣看來，市民每月化在飲食方面的無謂消耗在九萬萬元以上，這數目誠足驚人難怪當局要提倡節的了！</p>
<p>社會現象每每會有矛盾的。一方面是消耗在飲食的有那麼龐大的數字，而另一方面需要救濟的民衆亦實在大不乏人。據此間緊急救濟會消息：由十二月一日至二十六日止，該會共掩埋屍體五百十九具，平均每日掩埋二十人以上，據說死因多屬戰時顚連困苦，營養不足；勝利後又物價高漲，救濟不及，死後無親屬，或親屬無以爲殮的。於此，亦可見廣州民生問題的嚴重。</p>
<p>中央宣慰特使陳濟棠，李文範兩氏來粵，消息傳來，百粵民衆無不欣慰；有如這羣受難的孩子，在剛回復安定之後，得到一位家長來安慰一番一樣，好不興奮，可是，却苦了一班歡迎人員和記者們：在二十五日那天上午，便聽說兩特使十一時可到達，大家跑到碼頭，等到兩點鐘還沒有見人；到下午八點鐘接到消息，又說馬上就到了，結果還是撲一個空。原來兩特使當晚確已抵達省河，適値戒嚴，延至次日凌晨始入市。</p>
<p>交冬以來，這裏劇運似乎逐漸蓬勃。繼二方面軍政治大隊演出「朱門怨」之後，現在同時演出有廣東戲劇協會的「愁城記」，和藝聯劇團的「茶花女」。</p>
<p>在幾天以前，從邊城的昆明來了一批文化人：章泯，瞿白音，周鋼鳴，田念養，韓北屛，侯鳴皐，王逸，許秉鋒，洪迺等，這裏戲同志們伸出了他們　誠與灼熱之手來歡迎這羣文化鬥士，就在一個氣候溫和的日子裏，舉行一個盛大的歡迎會。會上大家喊出一個共同的口號：「一面建國，一而建劇」，（十二月二十九日）</p>

<h3>麥帥頒佈新指令後　日閣陷進退維谷　現正着手編造撤職人員名單　日官吏愛牽連將達二萬人</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據舊金山五日午夜廣播：麥帥下令不準以前日本官員參加目前政府工作後，將有兩巨頭提出辭職、其一為農林大臣松村，另一為工商大臣小笠原，此兩人均為大政翼贊會會員。</p>
<p>〔中央社東京五日專電〕日本人民今晨正　　於麥帥昨日頒佈指令內所包括之日本重大政治人物時，日本所有政界人士則以寒心等待麥帥此令之全部影響。據非官方估計，牽連於此令內之日本官員將達二萬人。麥帥之指令殆已醞成日本政界之毀滅，故日本　選可能將延期兩月之久。</p>
<p>〔聯合社東京五日電〕麥帥昨令日政府，肅清擁護侵略分子，并開始編列應撤職官員名單，日本政界大為震動，各報亦用大字標題稱為〔日本內閣危機〕自第一批戰爭犯名單發表以來，此次麥帥指令所引起之反響殆最廣大。日本內閣曾因此召開緊急會議，討論應付，大有無所　手足之概。「每日新聞」謂內閣已遭遇就職以來最嚴重之危機，各報擬一一舉出受此項指令影響之人及與大政翼贊會有關係者，其列名榜上之人員有樞密院長鈴木，曾於首相期內任大政翼贊會會長，此外有貴族院議員六人，內務大臣石渡，與樞密院議員一人，眾議院議員三人。外相吉田聞擬立立即赴統帥部獲取補充此項指令之詳細報告，今日下午可向閣議提出。日政府已迅速開始編列撤職人員名單，擬於發表前送交統帥部。據每日新聞稱，此項指令若嚴格實施，則全體閣員不受影響者袛有幣原首相與吉田外相二人。幣原首相已表示擬令受麥帥指摘諸閣員去職，另選賢能，以資應付。如是則內閣是否能改組以渡難關，將大成問題，若形勢轉惡，則內閣有全體辭職之可能。讀賣新聞謂，日本投降時首相鈴木及其繼任首相東久邇宮，均曾參加日本最高軍事會議，亦不免受此項指令影響，朝日新聞謂，此項指令雖在意料之中，然對進步黨不啻澆以一桶冷水，進步黨為日本最有勢力政黨之一，其幹部人員十五人中，袛有三人可以留住。該報上一日社論曾謂聯合國政策，迄今僅謀排除引導日本誤入歧途之人，今已更進一步而趨向建設一新日本。人民雖不知應選舉何種領袖，惟惡者既去，自應努力提出適當人物繼任。社會黨總部方面謂，此項指令，結果進步黨則被毀滅，自由黨亦有瓦解之虞，社會黨則有一利，黨員中雖有曾加入大政翼贊會者，但就全體而言，則將為社會黨一大勝利，此乃一極好機會，可利用以成為議會中之大黨。</p>
<p>緊急閣議延至今日召開</p>
<p>〔聯合社東京五日電〕幣原內閣因麥帥指令肅清日本政治界黷武分子，原定今日召開緊急會議，現已展期至明日。據內閣秘書長次田表示，內閣或將於改組後留任，次田自身恐亦不能保全職務。據稱會議延期延期，係因起草執行指令條件之緊急法令，今日未及完成。內閣將改於明晨十時召開會議，幣原感冒未愈，仍閉戶靜養，明日之會恐未能出席。至召集閣議之原因，以討論詔令為主，閣員對於現政府態度，將無正式決定，惟內閣是否全體辭職，或將所有不合格人員罷免之後繼續留任、此項緊急問題必將澈底加以討論。外相吉田於今日下午報告國事時，未必討論昨日麥帥之指令，吉田亦不　赴統帥部討論執行指令一事。據曾赴首相官邸之日本新聞記者所獲印象，謂幣原於免黜三五閣員後，殆擬繼續留任，至閣員更動人數，則當視如何解釋麥帥最近發出之兩項指令而定。</p>
<p>軍閥餘孽務必完全廓清</p>
<p>〔本報東京五日專電〕麥帥昨日下令日政府，清除一切醞釀，發動，及領導日本破壞世界和平之各級人員與組織，目的在使各政黨及政府本身脫出軍閥與凶殘之勢力，並將政府官員自秘密恐怖會社之襲擊恐怖中解放。麥帥訓令日政府，廢棄一切極端國家主義·恐怖的·軍閥會社團體，其他政治協社·組織·亦須加以管理，勿任不法分子在內控制。欺騙并驅使日本民眾進入征服全世界意念之政府人員，務須一律淘汰，不準用為公務人員。按照此項訓令，日本政府必須撤換，并限制曾使日本悮入歧途之一切負責份子。</p>
<p>被擯於主管職位以外者，計有下列各級人物：（一）戰犯，（二）各軍事機構人員，（三）曾服役於陸海軍之憲兵部隊，或其他特殊或秘密諜報部組織之一切官員，（四）曾於經濟財政上大量支援極端國家主義恐怖秘密愛國會社之經理人員，及其他主要官員，或其同樣性質之刋物主編，或出版機構，大政翼實會·政治翼實會·等社會佔有勢力之會員，（五）由於戰爭之　果，在各日軍佔領地區所設立之銀行·開發·　興等公司會社之董事長·副董事長·顧問·總計核·分公司經理·董理事，（六）某种特定高級官員，例如：朝鮮、台灣、廣東、南海、東印、越南、緬甸、　洲國、中國方面之總　·民政長官·軍事長官·及其同級人物，在蒙古·菲律賓·印度·泰國·統治當地合作派偽政府之一切日本官員，（七）以及其他軍國主義，與對反軍國制度之人施以暴行之一切人物。</p>
<h3>日檔案卷宗　預防被毀滅　漢奸名單尤應注意</h3>
<p>〔本報東京五日電〕麥帥總部下令日本政府，將各部之紀錄案卷文件公文悉數移歸原處，因此項文件有被毀滅之可能，故日本政府應供給副本。中日戰爭　　在其前與秘密特工組織發生關係而活躍於全中國之漢奸甚多，盼我政府當局諮請麥帥總部轉令日政府，由此項文件內提供尚未發現之漢奸名單，以清我民族之血統。</p>
<h3>麥帥拒絕日人　在我領海捕魚</h3>
<p>〔本報東京五日電〕日本商航界經由中央聯絡部轉呈麥帥總部海軍航運管理當局，請求將現　核准之日本三外捕漁區擴展至東部中國海及黃海水域，聞此項要求已被麥帥總部拒絕。</p>
<p>〔聯合社東京五日電〕讀賣新聞載稱：去年十二月三十一日至今年一月一日，日人赴伊勢神宮參拜者僅有八千人，平均以前每年為四十萬人，此殆麥帥最近訓令日政府廢除神道教及各神宮之結果。</p>

<h3>聯合國首屆大會　距開幕期僅五日　各國代表紛紛啟程赴倫敦　向大會提案昨日已告截止</h3>
<p>〔中央社倫敦四日專電〕威斯　斯特大寺正　舉行聯合國大會首屆會議之最後籌備工作，業已告竣，維護世界安全及和平之新世界組織，將在此正式揭幕。大會開幕典禮定一月十四日下午四時舉行，蓋欲使各無綫電評論員得將開幕情形，向世界各隅廣播也，據聯合國秘書處消息，代表各聯合國之記者，及無綫電評論員，約有四百萬人，業已領取記者入場劵聯合國籌備委員會主席哥倫比亞代表安貝博士，將任大會開幕典禮之臨時主席，英聯合王國首席代表阿特里首相將代表邀請國歡迎辭。開幕儀式據聞極為簡單，除開幕及歡迎辭外，大會第一日僅從事推舉大會之主席，各國代表團有業已抵達倫敦者，有在赴英途中，日內即可抵此者。僉信此次大會乃世界歷史各國政治家最大之一次聚會。據目下所獲消息，有兩國代表團將由各該國總理率領，此即英聯合王國及紐西蘭是也，此外美國法國丹麥荷蘭土耳其埃及希臘及挪威各代表團，將由各該國外長率領出席。頃得確怠，蘇外長莫洛托夫不能出席大會，改由副委員長維辛斯基率領代表團一行出席，加拿大代表團則由該團司法部長羅倫特統率。</p>

<p>重要議程</p>
<p>大會之又一重要工作，即為聯合國機構主席之選任，比利時外交部長史巴克，似宜担任此職。至於秘書長之選任，以會址既設在美國，故一般咸望以歐籍人担任，以資平衡。其他重要之議程，即為安全理事會六非常任理事之推選，加拿大既為原子秘密之保持者，可望當選為理事之一。此外若世界之難民問題，亦已列為議程之一。全體大會首次會議預料將　續一月，在結束以前，可望有若干中立國家參加聯合國機構。</p>

<h3>桑狄哥砲台屠戶　太田判處絞刑　本間隔庭聞訊容色陡變</h3>
<p>〔聯合社馬尼刺五日電〕日軍佔領菲列賓期內馬尼刺憲兵司令太田，以戰犯被控，業經審訊終結，於今日判處絞刑。太田有〔桑狄哥砲台屠戶〕之稱，於審訊人犯時非刑敲打，參死者甚眾。據審理此案之軍事法庭宣稱，太田於其部下之行為，及日軍之性質，知之甚稔，被所犯者不祗一罪，而為一連串之罪惡，雖託言奉命行事，實不能以此卸罪。太田執行絞刑之日期尚未確定，大約須待美最高法院決定山下率文上訴案以後，因此兩案之法律爭點係屬相同。本間中將在另一法庭中受審，聞太田判處死刑，不禁容色頓變，本間虐殺俘虜，其罪不下太田，證據　　，恐難倖免，無怪其聞心如此。</p>
<h3>美貸我鉅款　購買美棉　總額三千三百萬元</h3>

<h3>機器植棉　美國實驗成功</h3>
<p>〔聯合社阿特蘭大四日電〕在這機械化時代，機器植棉現在也不再是空談了。最近在美國植棉地帶的每一州，都曾實驗過一种採棉機器，其一小時所採得的數量，若改用人力，即在一個熟手，也非一星期地六十小時不辦。這種機器，現在還不多，一時也還不能大量製造，但是各處植棉農夫都在說機械化是必然的趨勢。</p>
<p>節省人力</p>
<p>在北卡羅林那州，有一家棉花公司，最近買了一部採棉機，將在收盛的時候，出租給農夫，每百磅取費美金一元二角五分，現用人力採棉，這些農夫須付每百磅二元二角五分到三元的工費。不儘採棉可用機器，此外還有除草機和焚草機，都是用以刈除莠草的。這項工作，向來全用人力，工人俯身而作，是十分喫力的事，這類機器，現在也已在若干棉場上用過，頗為成功，其效率無疑是還可增高。據農業部長安特遜估計，農業機械化的結果，五年或十年後，恐怕隻要三百萬農夫，就已足夠，所以在美國南部，必須　農夫找找尋農場以外的工作，所有權威方面的意見，　說南部農田將愈來愈大，數目反而減少，農夫和僱工也將減少，每人的平均收入，則大增加。安特遜又說，「農產量的增高，種類的增多，必定需要更多農具與機械的製造銷售，更多的中間工業，更多的運輸，更多的服務工業」</p>
<p>研求改進</p>
<p>但南部工業的膨脹，也不致排擠別地方的市場，因為南部所產的食糧，實際上都是南部自己所需要的。安特遜的話，明白指出這農業區中，工農商業互相有密切關係，正和別的經濟專家意見一致，南部棉田，近年已經大減，但產量則十年來已增至每畝一百磅，現在還想把它增加。美國棉業擴展服務處，主持一种改進運動，已屢次召集植棉地帶的研究人員舉行會議，訂定程序：第一，督促農夫勿再任意植棉，務必選取最適宜的地土，并顧慮到別種農產品所需要的地田；又促應用輪種法，和各種省工法，取當地最好的種子，利用最妥當的除蟲法，採集和軋子里，務期　到最高的品質，然後得以上等貨大宗銷售出去。此外，棉花還遭逢到許多新的敵手，如人造絲·尼龍·玻璃絲·以及紙等。人造絲纖維在美國的生產量，約等於一百七十萬包的棉花其價格較任何上等的紗都便宜。</p>
<p>用途至廣</p>
<p>更據研究家的報告，另有一种人造織物，也快要成功。這种織物可毋須紡織，做出來的時候，便是整幅的一片。一方面棉花的研究，也在併力進行，俾與人造織物一爭短長。美國棉業委員會最近以二百萬美元作基金，設立棉花研究所，幾乎每星期有發現棉花新用途的報告。棉花在目前究竟有多少用途，這裏自未能一一詳列，但據估計，在此次大戰中，單隻用於軍事的棉花製造品，便有一萬一千種之多。最新的發明，是在建造低值農舍的時候，外面可包以一種棉布，在室內可用於絕緣物體。另外還有一種不怕火不會腐蝕的棉花，也已研究成功。棉業已歷經許多危機，一九二〇年棉價自每磅美金四角五分跌至一角二分，又嘗受一種灰甲蟲的禍害，在最不景氣的時期，棉價　低至每磅六分的開口。</p>
<p>不怕勁敵</p>
<p>棉業委員會主席詹斯頓說：棉花的產價，固須力求低廉，但目前及將來對棉業并無真正的威脅。人造物的研究，是有顯著的成績，但尚無一種東西能夠在各種用途上，替代棉花而十分滿意。似乎靠科學的力量，找不到這樣全能的東西，堪與棉花競爭。近來很多提到苧蔴的話，說這是纖維最強的植物，在美國若干地區各有數百畝地田，種植苧蔴。有些經濟家以為這是棉花業毫不　　，因為棉業的喪鐘儘管敲過几次，但棉花還是昂然自若，奈何它不得。</p>
<h3>德皇威廉二世　皇冠發見　是否真品尚待調查</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦五日電〕德境管制委員會宣稱，前　　威廉二世之皇冠，及前者普魯士腓特烈大帝之鼻煙壺，已被英國官員在德境明登附近一教堂內發見，當係　亨索倫族之人於戰時藏匿該處者。自該種物件之藏匿，引起若干　言後，當局即　　　　之子奥斯加述出藏匿地點，故發見時渠亦在場。在教堂扶梯之　　內，發見二箱，其一內貯皇冠，其一則貯鼻煙壺。據奥斯加稱，王冠乃普魯士王所有，霍亨索倫族稱帝後，即為該族所保存，其後並未另製帝冠。至於此語是否屬實，該冠是否偽品均有待於調查。鼻煙壺為十八世紀時代之精品，有以琺瑯　金製者，以其手工精細而名貴。</p>

<p>〔路透社倫敦五日電〕為強化英國殖民地制度，以為建立較大自治政府之準備起見，前英國駐巴勒斯坦高級專員麥克馬格爾將赴馬爾太島，晤領袖人物，討論新憲法之方案。關於該島之地位爭辯已久，至一九四三年始由英政府允許於戰後恢復該地之負責政府，馬爾太於戰事中屢遭轟炸，損失重大，故麥克馬格爾此去同時報告馬爾太島對於財政援助之需要，麥克馬格爾甫自馬來亞歸來，在該地會討論海峽殖民地與馬來亞九邦合組聯邦之問題，其報告書今猶未曾發表。有人謂此項合併以及馬來亞公民資格之確立，對於今後經濟發展大有帮助。西非洲之西埃拉勒活納·岡比亞·尼日利亞·及黃金海岸等四殖民地，業已成立公同委員會，其最後目的亦在合併成較大之單位以便利發展。在菲洲坎雅·尼亞　蘭·丹迦尼亞卡·及烏根大四地，建立地區諮議會之計劃，雖在英下院一再提出，然尚未有所決議。關於西半球方面，英美之加里比安委員會，定二月二十一日在佛琴羣島之聖湯麥斯開會，荷法代表亦可參加，該委員會於一九四二年由英美政府合組成立，以促進加勒比安海區社會與經濟之合作，其後曾擴大二次，第一次准許西印度之非正式代表列席，本次則復邀請荷法代表參加。英國之加里比亞殖民地共有人口三百萬，英國之目的在建立英領西印度羣島聯邦，成立不列顛共和國以內完全自治之政府。</p>

<h3>納粹頭號間諜　在集中營享福　抗德同志在饑寒中掙扎</h3>
<p>— 英文大美晚報所載·本報編譯室譯</p>
<p>當歐洲紐倫儀國際法庭正在大審納粹要犯及其特務人員「蓋世太保」的時候，在世界的這一邊，在戰略上佔有重要而廣大的地位之中國，希特勒黨徒們却依然安富尊榮地享受着相當自由舒適的生活，而且對於他們往日所犯罪行，似乎也不致受到什麼處分的模樣。霍華攘系新聞協會駐華通訊員紐頓先生在他關於報道勝利後之上海德日地下活動的第三次通訊積中提到了上述的一個令人啼笑皆非的事實。</p>
<p>除了上述的事實而外，數千日本　錄，仍在中國境內自由自在地行動着，這顯然是美政府漢視德日在華行動之結果，同時，中闕當局正忙於對付共軍之紛擾，美軍當局又無權逮捕德日罪犯（除犯有直接損害美國人之特殊罪案者），這些事實，都給了德日兩國敵性份子以喘息逍遙的機會。</p>
<p>納粹要犯就逮</p>
<p>數週以前，美軍當局曾籲請中國方面拘捕著名納粹駐滬人員三百十九名中之一百〇三名，結果，拘獲人犯，五十餘名，僅及名單之半數。</p>
<p>在這一批被逮罪犯之中，許多份子，包括過去遠東德國最活躍的間諜在內，仍可能獲取其『出路」而自由出人於集中營。納粹廣播電台主持人，兼海通社駐滬通訊員愛華唐夫人，亦在被拘之列。</p>
<p>犯人帶做主意</p>
<p>關於遠東三大納粹份子，這裘擬向讀老報道一下。第一個，據說現正患『病』在身，所住的醫院是上海最上等的。第二個，已被拘入集中營，可是他仍可走出營外去，吃吃大餐，或者鑽進咖啡館去做做生意。只有第三個人，才豐禁在營內。依着各犯的重要性而論，上列三要犯就是；（一）駐華『第一號』納粹黨人普德卡藏，，他是德國情報局局長。（二）歐哈德中校，一名愛森斯拉吉，又名愛森勃萊休爾，他是希特勒在華的軍事商務特務機關「歐哈德事務局」局長，（三）拉赫爾曼，名義上是德國鐵道局負責人，實際上則是納粹黨在華活動的領導人物之一。</p>
<p>老東家的姿態</p>
<p>就常理而論，被拘納粹犯，除顧用少數「苦力」外，應不再　用僕人，但此間顯得例外，他們還雇有「老傭」和「大司務」，所以他們即使關閉在集中營內，也還是以「老東家」資格在這兒出現着。</p>
<p>另一方面，我們要叙述一段慘情。多多少少「無國籍」的流亡之徒，早就被希特勒驅逐出境的男男女女，或是爲躱避納粹特務警察之毒手而逃亡到這兒的人們，在目前充斥着納粹份子及日本軍民的上海，竟無法覓得其棲身之所，只得苦悶地以破舊的蓬帳爲他們的「公館」，侷居在虹口之一角。在這個地帶，納粹黨徒在戰爭期間，曾經　武揚威，逍遙過市，坐的是漂亮汽車，穿的是全副戎裝，硬要難民們跟他們『澈底合作』，然後由他們的軍部當局簽發『通行證』，這也許就是他們口頭上所謂的「自由出入』吧。</p>
<p>多悽慘的對照</p>
<p>納粹住三層樓洋房，這在前此日軍佔領期間，原是一所中學校的所在。磚牆刷新，地板光滑，窗戶也都明淨。</p>
<p>然而，反納粹的難民之羣，住在哪一種情况之中呢？他們住在熙德路難民營裏，所謂「房間」只是像山洞一般黑暗，不見天日，因爲窗子的設備是沒有的，住在那裏，簡直像牲畜一樣。納粹黨徒兩人所佔住的房間，遠較十個反納粹難民所居者爲大。</p>
<p>在喫的方面，兩者之間對照起來，也眞够呌人喪氣，這世界竟如此殘酷無情，豈不呌人難於置信呢？然面這正是眞實的情形，非呌人實信不可！</p>
<p>納粹黨徒，有酒有肉，而且麵包一袋袋堆疊着，其高度竟與天花板相齊。而反納粹的離民們，却只靠聯合國善後救濟總署偶然送一點麵粉來接濟，此外，更談不上什麼食糧了。</p>
<p>頭號間諜活動</p>
<p>希特勒爲了掩護歐哈德的間謀活動起見，曾呌他以商人姿態出現於中國，其後再呌他組織了歐哈德事務局。他負有半外交官的使命，並以完成三大目標為其中心任務，第一個目很是偵查蘇購之行動，第二是調查日本之情勢，第三是報道遠東的戰局與物資狀况。此一時期，他曾經數度前往日本，有所活動。</p>
<p>滬粵股情報綱</p>
<p>這個圓目猙獰的歐哈德，曾經建立了納粹在華據點三處：（一）北平，（二）上海，（三）廣州。以上三處，均設有無綫電台，除直接與柏林通報外，還把重要情報供給讓國的潛艇當局。所有各站供給潛艇之情報，均係由滬收發，然後轉達柏林。</p>
<p>上海的洋難民</p>
<p>上海一埠現有的「洋難民」，總數達三萬九千萬之譜。其中一萬五千名是德奧波捷國籍人民，一萬四千名係猶太籍，六百名是淸敎徒，四百名是回敎徒。他們中間，很多人都被當局列入『無國籍』人民。他們相當地諒解中國政府當局爲共軍事件所擾而無暇顧及救濟事宜，因此他們更般切地盼望着另一種援助的力量。這刀量便是美國人民所能賜予的力量。</p>
<h3>日僑展開密談式地下運動　四派互爭領導權　當局應強化再敎育工作</h3>
<p>— 合眾社袁倫仁著　本報編譯室譯</p>
<p>滬市日人的再敎育運動，在第三方面軍主持下開始，將近兩個月了，目前正遭遇日人的嚴重地下反抗運動，日人投降之初，對於中國當局寬待的恩意，似已逐漸冷淡。據報告：在滬市北區日僑集中營裏，已經發現一小部份日人，對中國當局濯諸九萬名日僑的民主思想，採取秘密而强有力的反抗。這一小部份日人，以爲他們所處的新地位，完全是被征服者，人數雖不多，可是很有些勢力。</p>
<p>大部份的日人毫不關心政治上的爭論，某一日人說：他們正忙於白求生活，他們之中許多人在憂慮着他們的錢是否够維持到被遣送回國時爲止。有的在想回到祖國之後，是否有辦法在那裏活得過去。</p>
<p>共同目標　謀反抗再敎育</p>
<p>在另一極端方面，還有一小部份日人，亟力不否認是共產黨徒，他們公開主張廢除天皇制度，熱烈支持麥克阿瑟統帥的管制日本計劃。這一部份日人，人數實在太少，勢不足以感化整個日僑團體。上海的日人，心理上都接受以前的軍國主義和法西斯學說，某一接近管理日僑集中區負責當局的消息靈通方面，把日人地下反抗運動的團體，分成四派。這四派在日僑集中區內互相爭奪領導權。他們而子上假裝服從中國管理當局的命令，事實上終不能澈底實行，他們有一個共同目標，反抗中國的再敎育計劇。</p>
<p>派別互異　各目懷着鬼胎</p>
<p>其中一派，據悉是由前日本駐華的外交領館人員領導，這個「外務部派」的領袖是前日駐僞南京政府公使土出。</p>
<p>土田現在還担任着中國當局所委日人自治協會主席的職務。有資格方面，把他比作日本投降前的日本領袖之一，並且說中國當局正攷電另遷一個氏主主義化的人，來繼承他，可是至今還沒有找到一個和這老外交家簧格聲望相孚的人物。</p>
<p>日木的軍隊，雖已解除武裝，在日人國體中，仍舊保持它的勢力，把日人從幾世紀來被軍人唬壞的心理改變過來，需要很長的時間。這「軍人派」的領導人物，是前任日本在華派遣軍總司令岡村寗次，他現在是南京聯絡部的長官。據說，在上海方面的代表是松井，他指揮的部隊，以前便駐在上海。</p>
<p>一向妒忌陸軍的日海軍，領導着第三派。據說主持人是某中將，這第三派沒有陸軍派的勢力大，因爲陸軍派還有以前憲兵隊的便衣人員在內，這些人依然佔有很大的勢力。</p>
<p>第四派，便是以前日本屆劃民團的後身。領袖是曾任駐滬總領事的中島。珍珠港事件前，日本居留民團是本埠政治上日方有用有勢的武器，它一向控制着前公共租界工部局內的日本代表團，不過這個團體並不足以代表上海的全體日僑，它祗代表大商人而已。</p>
<p>衝鋒隊員　前身均係憲兵</p>
<p>華人消息靈通方面告合衆社說，日人的地下反抗運動，到目前爲止，還限於口頭上的活動。他們對於負責再敎育工作的中國官員，發動密談式反抗運動，而對於協助中國再敎育計劃的日本人，也一般的加以玷辱。</p>
<p>好幾　協助或站在中國再敎育人員一邊的日籍人員，被暴力攻擊的事件，已經發現。第三方面軍所辦日文報「民主日本」的兩三個助理編輯，都曾被暴徒狙擊過。</p>
<p>一個極端國家主義的黨派，成立衝舞隊組織，取名「上海衝鋒隊」，其中不少人是以前憲兵隊的隊員。</p>
<p>民主份子　僅有七十餘人</p>
<p>在另一方面，有一小部份日本人，倒很接受中國的再敎育運動，尤其是智職階級人士，的有七十多個日本人在「文化人俱樂部」內，是很活動的會員，這裏的領袖是星野，此人是上海唯一公開主張立即廢除天皇制的日木人。星野的兇弟也在戰犯之列，現在囚藥在蒼茂盬獄內，他是東條內　的賽記長官，是麥帥最後宣佈的戰犯黑單內的一個。西本親王的名字，民治天皇的兄弟，也同在這職犯名單上出現。</p>
<p>文化人俱樂部的某一會員，告合衆社說：除非天皇制廈除，眞的民主在日本決無實現。他承認，他們這一批人，不過代表日本人民中的一小部份。他指出在東京高等工業學校最近舉行的投票中，三千個學生內，祗有廿七個投票主張廢除天皇制，五十八個主張保存舊皇朝，大的有兩十個學生贊成減　皇室特繼至最少限慶。</p>
<p>不少日僑　擁護麥帥方針</p>
<p>這個文化人俱樂部會員這說：本市有不少日本人同意麥帥在日施行的計劃，他們相信，假使日本政府在字面上，精神上，都澈底賞行最高統帥的命令，日本的民主化一定可以成功，所以日不有民主思想的人，反對日本現任政府，因爲它並不忠實地執行麥帥的訓令。</p>
<p>當詢及其個人對於華人對待日本平民和俘虜的意見時，他說：「戰時我在此地，我還記得日本人對待中國人的情形，爾者之間的對立性，實在太尖說化了！」</p>
<p>許多日本人　得在待機回國期間，應該爲他們回返祖國後，更困苦的生活預作準備，他們中間，許多人還不知道回國以後是否還有　可住。他以爲日本人應該多知道世界大事，放開他們的目光，他解釋日本人學習英文的趨勢，乃係再敎育計劃中的一項節目，使他們自己可以讀英文公告，幷且可和駐日美國佔領軍直接發生接觸。</p>
<p>打撈中的「江建」輪　巴東台子灣</p>
<h3>溝通台灣與祖國最大商輪　『臺北號』將通航</h3>
<p>— 本報特久記者　錢沛</p>
<p>今日爲台灣光復後第一度新年，是日晨　初出，晴光輝映，春色無邊，記者自床上（其實非床，席地而臥之「榻榻眼」耳）躍起，　脫一年以來之疲勞，憂心，失望與悲痛，對於前途不覺發生無限熱望與股切之期待，對於一回事業，亦覺新機勃發，而愛護邦國之心，亦油然而生。</p>
<p>此處以實際上之地位而　，實一海隅孤島，天各一方，但値此一元復始，萬象更新之今日，亦正與國內同胞同深慶祝，無分內外也，今日慶祝元旦節目，有上午十時中山堂（公會堂）之國拜，慶祝大會，有下午二時基盬港台北號鉅輪之命名典禮，有下午台北市民全體之遊行大會，有晚間公會堂交響變國之盛大演奏，顯目繁多，此不過路舉其一二而已。</p>
<p>巨輪臺北號　舉行命名典禮</p>
<p>「合北號」輪原名「大雅丸」，戰時被炸沉沒於基廠港內。台灣收復後，中國當局即命日本海軍負實人計劃基隆與高雄兩港內沉船之打撈工作，並由台灣長官公署交通處督促進行。「大雅丸」之打勞工作，不久即由交通處基廠港務局設計進行，於十一月初旬將該輪撈起，進塢修理。十二月終工程告竣，出塢後，停靠基隆港第三碼頭。該船長二一八公尺，寬一八·二公尺，深一一·一公尺，　產約七午噸，有透平機二千二百馬力，航行速率每小時十海哩，實中國商輪中最大之船舶也。今日之命名典禮，亦即在陳儀行政長官主持下，舉行於基隆港第三碼頭，自下午二時餘至四時餘始畢，美軍亦派遣代表前往參加，頗極一時之盛。今後此船即將加入台航航綫，作爲恢復台灣與國內溝通航運之基本底位，聞不日即將試航。在比內外交通等於斷絕之今日，該輪之命名實給予孤島人士以不少興奮，此亦新年最好之喜訊也。</p>
<p>忍辱五十年　出污泥而不染</p>
<p>再從台北市下午舉行之盛大遊行看來，亦彌覺台灣民衆之可愛，但我之所謂可愛者，並非任何冠冕堂皇之名詞，亦不是因爲台灣民衆能如上海人民之迎合孝敬而以金錢博得之可愛。比較的台灣人民是剛性的，絕對不懂得以聲色犬馬紙醉金迷來毀損自己或糜爛他們的官長。我所謂可愛，是他們經過五十年淪者，受盡欺凌壓迫，又至所謂奴役化敎育之後，除去絕少數劵民之外，竟能如出汚泥而不染，絲毫沒有喪失中華民話之個性，和熱烈投入祖國懷抱之眞誠，記者在此磁大游行中，嘗於窗際窺見男女小學生手執國旗，歡欣歌唱之熱烈，個個盡力呼喊，肺部之擴張，精神之飽滿，這將五十年來之積恨與今日之歡欣，宣洩無遺。</p>
<p>再則台灣民衆，雖在日本統治壓迫之下，所受到之平民敎育，水準亦較國內爲高。此自報紙之普遍銷行，即可窺見一斑。台灣新生報自日文台灣新報接收改辦之後，雖因文字關係，銷歡大跌，但現在尚有十五萬份，其數量頗足驚人。再以今晚在公共會堂舉行之交響樂演奏而言，亦可見到台灣公民敎育程度之高，該交響樂團全隊八十餘人，由團長蔡繼現　　指揮，聞諸蔡氏，凡此八十餘人，均係此次失土光復後，自台灣全省招募之中國籍靑年　樂人才，經過爾個月訓練演習之後，即成續斐然，非台民一般教育程度之高，曷克臻此？</p>
<p>新心理建設　可望迅完成</p>
<p>具此平民敎育之根基，而民衆絕對沒有喪失其崇高的國民性，故台灣民衆心理建設之前途，實在極有希望，並可期待其迅速完成。行政長官陳嚴曾於其除夕廣播詞中，表示了對於心理建設之希望，謂擬於三十五年一年之內，使台灣全省的敎員學生，大概都能說國語，通國文，知國史。我以爲這是絕對可能之事，因爲台灣人之學習國語，頗具眞誠，且有顯著迅速之進展。當然，省內外交通之恢復，使國內能講國語，敎國文之敎員們，多多來此工作，亦屬不可再緩之要圖。</p>
<p>台灣因國勢衰弱，致與祖國分離至半世紀之久，今以八載抗戰之功，竟得失土重歸，金　不缺，台灣與祀國命運之相關相聯若此，吾人欲保持疆土之完整，自必先求保持台灣之道。當政者自有其碩劃宏獻，記者旨在溝通台灣與內省間之聲氣，介紹民情文物於他省，並於可能範圍內，勉盡台灣民衆喉舌之責，以言論督促各種庶政之推行與建設之促成</p>
<h3>遍體鱗傷六大江輪　突破新紀錄　招商局修船史之插曲</h3>
<p>— 徐學禹</p>
<p>抗戰以前，招商局共有海輪十六艘，江輪十二艘。</p>
<p>抗戰的初期，這些輪船在完成了軍公民運的任務後，炸損的炸損，失陷的失陷，沉寒要塞的更永沉江底了，最後僅剩了六艘江輪，冒着水急灘多的三峽之險，創造了川江航行的紀錄，經過一年多的時間，居然帶着敵人砲火所賜的遍體創痕，安然撤退入川</p>
<p>江輪受傷　入川就醫</p>
<p>入川後，依然得不着安全，「江建」在二十九年九月間被敵機炸沉於巴東台子灣，「江華」復在三十年八月間在萬縣被炸。「江建」被炸沉後，打撈了兩年之久，才勉强開到重慶。「江華」被炸焚燒，全部木材設備燒光不算，鐵板角鐵也燒得凹凸彎曲，不平不直。此外，「江安」，「江順」，「江新」，「江漢」，也因爲終年停泊不動，起初又因經費無着，年久失修，以致戰時所受的創傷，不僅不能醫治，反而情勢益見嚴重。</p>
<p>當時，招商局便在事先考慮到反攻復員時期一屆，長江中下游的運輸工具，需要必定很大，這幾艘殘破的江輪，祇要能够勉强修好，依然是反攻復員時期的一支遝輸上的主力，於是便下了加以修理的決心。</p>
<p>財力人力　俱成問題</p>
<p>修理的事，說來容易做來難，因爲第一要錢，第二要人，第三要物。</p>
<p>錢的問題，在我政府富局賜予特別補助之下，總算迎刃而解了，但是因爲物價和工資的逐步飛漲，往往一件工程，招標的包價已經超出預算很遠，工程還沒有進行到一半，承包人又己經因爲包價過低，不勝賠累，輕則要求加價，重則棄工遠通，似此情形，不獨影響到經費，而且影響到工程。</p>
<p>人的間題，最主要的就是技術工人的缺乏。後方的技術工人，大部分是由上海漢口撤退過去的，人數畢竟有限，而後方的新興工業，則逐年增加，因此技工的需要，一年比一年增加。各工廠爲了招攬技工，不惜高價挖拉，因此工人跳廠的風氣，所在都是，往往正在積極進行中的工程，因爲工人離開，半途即告停頓，這種困難，祇有當時身受的人，才能深切的理解。</p>
<p>石卵沙灘　天然船塢</p>
<p>物的間題，可分設備與材料兩項：設備方面，第一，在後方，旣沒有乾船塢，更沒有浮船塢，但是必須修理水綫以下的船底及車軸，沒有辦法，祇有用最笨的方法去硬幹。沿着江邊去勘察，結果在離重慶七海浬的唐家陀江邊，找到面積相當大的一塊石卵沙灘，那邊地面很平坦，土質也堅硬，於是等水大的時候，就把船開出去，停泊在那塊灘上，再等水枯的時侯，就讓她擱在那裏，同時趕緊用木椿在船底的四週撑住，使她站穩，然後再用人工把船底下面的沙石挖去，墊上木方，這樣就成就了我們的天然船塢。但是川江的枯水時期，不過三四個月，因此必須在這祐水時期，趕緊把船底敲銹，挖裲油漆，以及抽換車軸，溪灌套筒等工程一齊做好，好剩春季深水的時期漂墩。談到潥激，更是一件危險而艱苦的工作，快到漲水的時候，必須把人手備齊，日夜守候，一到適當的水位，就得用最迅連的手段，在最短期間把船漂起，把樁拆去，並且把機器開動，吾則川江水急，船身浮動了，椿還沒有拆盡，樁碍着船，船擦着椿，都會發生嚴重的後果，若果機器不能及時發動，那末水衝船漂，危險當然更甚。</p>
<p>臨時工塲　因陋就簡</p>
<p>第二，在後方，沒有大的起重機器設備，有時要拉動一隻三百呎長五十呎寬三四千噸重的船，我們祇有依靠全用人力的覇王車。這是一種極簡單的東西，每部霸王車要用五十多個人，祇能够起重三十噸，所以多的時候，一次要用到幾十部。</p>
<p>第三，唐家沱是一個偏僻的村鎭，那邊沒有電力，沒有工廠，因此較大或較複雜的機件，必須用船拆運到重慶去修配。但是另星的配件，斷不能一一到重慶去配齊。就在灘邊，用竹璧蘆席，搭起臨時工廠來，車床是手搖的，鎭床是脚踏的。這樣因陋就就領的工廠，和上海的造船廠相比擬，當然有小巫見大巫之感。</p>
<p>材　奇缺　影響工程</p>
<p>至於材料方面，事實是如此的。我們不必諱言，材料缺乏是被封鎖的大後方普遍嚴重的現象。四川本是出產木料的省份，但是供不應求，修理船隻，還得自已派人到山裏去採購，自己去運輸，才有得用。五金是修船的大宗材料，可是這一項偏就奇缺，用的鉚釘螺絲，都只好用廢鐵製造。最沒有辦法的是「盼更」，這是修船的必需材料，但是最不容易買到。往往因爲材料的不湊手，影響工程的進行，以致延悮工期，增加費用，終至逼得包工以一逃了之。</p>
<p>在這種艱苦條件之下修成的船，當然不能符合理想標準。修船目標是：第一能開。第二安全。此外，不敢再存奢望。因此，修好的船，談不到舒適，更談不到美觀。</p>
<p>修船目標　如願完成</p>
<p>現在戰事已告勝利。復員正在開始，招商局修好的船，一起都從重慶開出了，並且都安全的到達了上海，現在還繼續在從事復員運輸的工作。以上兩個目標，總算是達到了。但是，一切爲旅客舒適的設備都不够齊全。當局方面認爲祗有在熱誠的服務和將來的新船兩方面，盡力來彌補目前的缺陷。</p>

<h3>戰後人心的分析</h3>
<p>— 陳高傭</p>
<p>近來常見報紙上有些文章貢獻政府說「不要失掉人心」，而政府當局亦一再訓戒接收人員說「接收工作要注意接收人心」。但是人心不同，各如其面，知人知面不知心，彼此個人往來，要想把握住對方的心理，已經是一件不容易的事情，何况要把握住廣大的羣衆心理？所以我雖然不是專門研究心理學的人，而於大家熱烈注意獲取民心的時候，對於戰後中國人民的心理願作一偶簡單的分析。</p>
<p>亘古未有的八年長期抗戰，凡屬中國人民沒有一個不受到極大的刺激。自從八年以前，蘆溝撟事變發生，全國人民的神經逐步進入於極端緊張的狀態中。此後戰事愈演愈烈，戰區愈擴愈大，人民所受的刺激亦愈來愈深。淪陷區的人民被敵僞壓迫蹂躪，固然是求生不能求死不得，自由區的人民除了出錢出力支持抗戰，又不免挨受轟炸，奔跑遷徙，顚沛流離之苦。總之，無論什麼地方，中國人民的神經沒有一個不是處於寢食不安的狀態中。這種神經緊張的生活當然是一種痛苦的生活，但是經過八年的長期緊張，把這種非常生活不知不覺形成一種習慣了。一且抗戰勝利，環境轉變，大家彷彿透了一口氣，神經不必再像以前緊張了，但是由緊張而歸於鬆弛，由忙迫而歸於閒散，初時雖覺舒快，稍久又不免感覺空虛。感覺空虛自然要發生新的要求，新的要求不能具體確定，或雖確定而一時不能實現，自然要對當前的環境表示不滿。這是我們對於戰後人心應該瞭解的第一點。</p>
<p>國家民族的盛衰典亡，與個人生活的休戚利害，其間關係密切，這是世界各國人民所周知的事情。但是因爲中國敎育不普及，人民的知識不發達，對於這種近代公民最基本的常識，在過去可說有大多數人是莫名其妙。經過八年的抗戰，淪陷區的人民親受類似亡國或甚於亡國之苦，固然把國家民族與個人的關係深深地體會到了。就是自由區的人民，因爲與敵人直接間接從事八年的長期戰鬥，亦把國家民族的觀念特別加强了。總之，在長期抗戰中，全國人民都忍受絕難忍受的痛苦，過一種無法生活的生活，於是不的而同的大家以爲一且抗戰勝利，國家民族馬上復興，個人生活就可以美滿如意，但事實並不這樣簡單容易的，抗戰固難，建國允需吃苦，個人的生活在過渡時期，也許不惟不能美滿如意，甚至有些地方和以前一樣或甚且不如以前，因此不免要由失望而不滿，由不滿而怨懟，但我們要知道國家民族與個人固然是休戚相關利害一致的，而在相關一致的統一性中叉有其對立性。所以無論在抗戰時期或建國時期，當羣策羣力注意國家民族的集體工作時，個人的生活多少不免要受到一點犧牲。過去抗戰，我們人民對國家民族的貢獻犧牲，固然是世界人士有目共睹，但是蘇聯建國，兩個五年計劃的完成，蘇聯人民對於他們國家的　獻犧牲，也該可作為我們的歷史借鏡。然而這種歷史事實，絕不是一般老百姓所能知道，因此他們對於戰後種種情形有所不滿亦屬人情之常。這是我們對於戰後人心應該瞭解的第二點。</p>
<p>社會秩序，破壞易而建設難，由自然的演進與歷史的發展而革故鼎新，人民還不大感覺，各用外力與生硬手段把一個自然發展的社會秩序弄得亂七八糟，再來恢復原狀，那好像把一個機器用暴力搗毀再來修整，確是一件千難萬難的事情。一個家庭遭受戰禍而毀損了，今天要從新佈置，或一個大家庭搬塲一次，要安排得井井有條，恐怕也要費上兩三個星期或一二個月的工夫。何况一個國家？淪陷區域，敵僞控制七八年甚至十數年，對於自然區城任意割裂，對於組織制度顚倒妄爲，對於敎育文化和生產建設盡力破壞，把一個好好的中國社會亂糟糟弄得面目全非。在這種情形之下，就是好好地整理，亦不是短期間可以恢復原狀。何况不可偉言，接收工作有若干地方又沒有能够科學化合理化，甚且還有少數人藉接收而營私舞弊，那簡直是亂上加亂。人民因此而生不滿之心，可說也是難免的事情。這是我們對於戰後人心應該瞭解的第三點。</p>
<p>此次抗戰勝利使中華民國得列爲四强之一，可說是中國歷史上空前未有的一件豐功偉業。無論任何人，不能否認這件豐功偉業是由　蔣主席領導成功的，但是實際從事的則可說凡屬中國人民，除過喪心病在的漢奸和趨炎附勢的準漢奸以外，都屬有份，儘管參與工作的直接間接不同，所表現的成績大小有異，而其一心一德想把敵人打倒救國家於危亡之中，則是人人相同的，一且抗戰勝利，患難雖未盡去而似乎已去，功利　未見來而人人以爲即來。共患難易，共安樂難，自古已然，今亦如此。於是接收有爭執，復員有爭執，黨與黨之間有爭執，派興派之間有爭執，機關與機關之間有爭執，甚至同一機關之中亦有爭執，爲地盤而爭執，爲權位而爭執，甚至爲一幢房子一輛車于或一個寫字檯亦可有爭執。爭得到的人當然無話可說，爭不到的人就不免發生怨懟。其實，爭得到的人與爭不到的人都還有爭的資格，可憐大多數的純良老百姓在抗戰期中出錢出力有份，受敵僞壓迫蹂躪有份，而到了勝利的時候祗有眼看少數人爭這樣爭那樣，而自己八年來精神上與物質上的損失却無處去問，甚至還不免夾到你爭我奪的當中繼續有所損失，這如何能使人心平？這是我們對於戰後人心應該瞭解的第四點。</p>
<p>漢奸爲虎作倀，出賣民族，魚肉人民，凡屬中國人民無不切齒痛恨，而一般忠貞守節之士允抱忠奸不兩立之態度。在抗戰期中，大家都以爲一旦戰爭勝利，這些喪心病在的大小漢奸一定都逃不了國法的裁判。但是勝利以後三四個月，漢奸之落網者究有若干無從詳知，而滿網者觸目皆是。小漢奸都逍遙法外，甚且搖身一變仍然從事公務者到處有之；而大漢奸之未受拘捕，甚且仍混充名流要人者亦未必絕無，反過來看，八年來忠貞不屈，堅苦車絕之人，則仍然度其淸苦生活，甚至還有仍受當年作過敵偽爪牙如今變成勝利官吏者之欺壓，世間不平之事孰有過於此者？當然，懲治漢奸條例，國家已正式公佈，拘捕漢奸和審判漢奸亦已經開始，政府對於此事絕非置之不辦，但是人民八年來對於漢奸的積怨，總覺政府對於道班國家民族的敗類，辦的不够嚴不够快與不够普通。這是我們對於戰後人心應該瞭解的第五點。</p>
<p>生離死別，人所是苦。戰爭八年，家屬流離。一且勝利，人人以爲可以骨肉團聚，重享天倫之樂。誰知道三四月來交通不便之苦，仍無異於戰時，如華北之鐵路被拆，火車被毀，交通不便比之戰時猶有過之。於是八年來父子不相見，兄弟妻子離散者，如今還祗得「舉首望明月，低頭思故鄉，」「但願人長久，千里共嬋娟。」這種現象當然是一時的，但是在歸心如箭的多年流離者心中，即爲一種極大的焦躁不安。這是我們對於戰後人心應當瞭解的第六點。</p>
<p>工商界人，無論他們對於國家民族的認識程度怎樣，他們的第一目的總是營利致富。抗戰期中，無論自由區與淪陷區，不必諱言是有許多藉國難而發財致富的人。這些發國難財的人，他們的本事是投機囤積。勝利以後，投機者無機可投，囤積者無貨可囤，眼看自己的財產一天比一天少，而對於將來的民族生產事業却又感覺前途茫茫，無從着手，於是亦不得不表現一種焦躁不安的心理。我們對於這些人，孳孳爲一己謀財富，固不必表示同情，但能因勢利導使他們都走入民族生產事業的路上，對於國家的經濟建設總不能不算是一部份力量。這是我們對於戰後人心應該瞭解的第七點。</p>
<p>以上所舉，是就戰後人心表露的較顯著者而言。據此七點，我們可又得一結論：全國人民對於蔣主席領導抗戰得到光榮的勝利，是一致表示誠心悅服，而對於政府一部份人員的一部份工作，則以爲不能符合他們的期望；對於國家民族的前途是感覺有了新的生命，而對於個人目前的現實生活則感覺仍極艱難困苦。總之，他們對於八年的長期痛苦忍受够了，希望以後不要再有甚麼不必要的痛苦來磨折他們。維能瞭解人民的心理，誰就能得到人民的擁護！</p>

<h3>金鈔市況穩健　華股高峯疊出　公債外股買氣興奮</h3>
<p>烚赤昨頗穩定，多空角逐頗力，套賣套買亦不一致，以致爭持不已，惟證劵大漲，獲利後之游資源源流入，結果較前收回好一萬，全日人心已較前數日稍見興奮，惟散戶沉緬於證劵，金市雖被帶上，未免遜色，紙商大戶放空頗多，不可不防反動，銀樓飾金掛八萬五，、紋銀仍爲六百元，銀元亦在四百四站定，暗拆仍形鬆動，約八分至一角。</p>
<p>美鈔亦隨金市進退，交易有限，各方靜待時機，大戶無甚活動、廠方逢低略有納胃，得以支持，目晨開一三八〇元後緩緩上升，午後遂穿出一四〇〇元大關，結果較前收回升十五元，港票老貨受港地申鈔上升影響，供方較殷，新貨則見穩，結果老貨跌五元，新貨好起一元。</p>
<p>公債買方依舊興奮，丙稱自晨開八一五元後，一路盤好，求過於供，惟過程平庸，並無特殊表演，華洋股票飛騰，助長債市買氣不少，最高見九〇〇元高價，結果較前收漲五元至七十元不等　華股市况再接再厲，紙業帮脫金力購永　，證券帮則出入不一，雖有一部份流往金市，但以股市活潑，不久又有若干重入懷抱，證券公會希望頗濃，以致冷熱門同時遭人垂靑，尤以永紗鱉頭獨佔，領導前進，最高竟喊過一千元成交，結果較前收永紗升八十元，美亞八十五元，三小熱好起一成左右，業中人因洋股怡紗飛升至三千以上，照資產佔計，永紗機件新穎，並已開工，現價尚較便宜，紙紗兩幫力取永紗，前途勢將俏。</p>

<h3>上海商業團體籲請豁免所得稅　切實扶助工商企業　完成今後建國大業</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市各業同業公會共計約二百餘單位，近因戰後百業凋弊，帳册簿據殘缺不全，對於因拆合帳面資本金額而引起之假盈餘，恐政府不明實情，征踝所得稅，工商業必將不支，曾於前此招待宣慰使監察使及社會部洪次長席上，由染織業公會兼棉布業公會整委潘士浩氏發言，請求政府免征卅四年度所得稅，金潤庠駱清華諸氏均支持此說，全塲一致附議，散會後復經正式備具公文，各公會聯名向行政院請願，茲探錄其要點如左：</p>
<p>虛帳實課於理不合</p>
<p>本市工商企業公司行號僞幣資本折算一案，各業公會於本市市商會工商法規委員會周諮博訪之下，曾詳細研究實際情形，分徵專家意見，商討折合標準，僉認僞幣資本之折合法幣，在會計上尚有合理準則可循，但因此而引起之假性盈餘，如照所得稅及利得稅法課稅，不惟在會計上爲不合理，在課稅手續上亦屬無從措辦。</p>
<p>刧餘商業無力負擔</p>
<p>且工商各業於八年敵僞長期壓迫之下，平巳凋敝不堪，黃台之瓜，何堪再摘，商民救死扶傷之不膽，實際更無盈利之可言，考賦稅原理，重在負擔公平，直接稅中如所得稅等，誠爲合理之良稅，近世先進諸國，莫不以此爲國家稅收之得心，我國於二十五年公佈所得稅暫行條例時，本市市商會與各業公會即首先擁護，並召集稅則研究會，舉行會計技術演講會，開辦講習班等，盡力協助推行，足爲全國表率，事績俱在，可以復按，抗戰以後，本市各業受盡摧殘，生產降低，物資减少，市場斷絕，雖因僞幣幣値低落，不無紙上富貴之象，但按諸實際，無論工商各業之原料貨品，俱不能保持戰前之原狀，明盈暗虧，各業皆然，元氣喪盡，恢復匪易，設政府對於此種偽性盈餘，亦必責令納稅，則工廠勢必出售其生產工具，商店亦將拋售其所剩貨品，竭澤而漁，不惟無法培養稅源，抑且使全市工商企業無法維持，影響所及，各業雖欲破產完課亦恐另無受主，是非政府沒收廠產商品，收歸國營，無從收徵稅款，當非政府所願出此者也。</p>
<p>過分利得稅應停徵</p>
<p>再所得稅與利得稅，其課稅於營利事業者，必以營業上實際獲有純益爲踝稅之目的，現代直接稅法理所提倡之負担公平，眞詮在此，値茲敵人投降，戰事已終，因戰時而頒行之非常時期過分利得稅，於法應即停徵，營利事業所得稅其應按照營利事業實際純益計算課徵，更無疑義，是故收復區工商企業因偽幣膨脹而發生之假性盈餘，自不能視爲課稅之目的，其理尤爲彰明。</p>
<p>營利所得准予免稅</p>
<p>且滬市工商企業，於敵僞榨取之餘，凡屬向大後方接濟人力物資資金，與夫應募政府各種債劵捐款，其業務設施，存貨儲藏，帳册記載，爲避免敵僞查悉起見，早已殘缺不全，如因整舊佈新，再圖復興，而稅收機關必欲徵課者，其將如何計算，以不能計算之事，而漫加估計，勢必造成苛求，有失人民對於政府之期望及信仰，基上理由，公會等一致籲請，政府對於收復區工商企業，應予切實之扶助，庶可究成經濟之復員，而發展今後建國之大業，謹請對於三十四年度之營利事業所得稅，援照豁免收復區田賦成案，准予明令免課，俾利工商而培稅源。</p>

<h3>王鳳喈氏向中央報告　湘省教育復員計劃　並陳述戰時敎育機關損失情形</h3>
<p>〔本報長沙專訊〕湘敎育廳長王鳳喈氏，頃向中央報告湘省敎育機關戰時損失情形及今後敎育復員計劃，大意如下：湖南全省，自廿七年三月起，敵機即濫炸大小城市，允蓄意破壞敎育機關，損失奇重。廿七年五月敵人由湘北太舉南犯，長衡各大城相繼失守，沿粵漢湘桂兩路及長衡外圍各縣市，十之七八淪陷。迄直至三十四年四月湘西會戰，一向僻處之湘西各縣，亦均被敵人竄擾。</p>
<p>戰時損失情形</p>
<p>僅就全省敎育機關而言，其損失情形如下：省立敎育機關及省立各級學校，總値約爲二一六億二四三五萬元，縣市鄉保學校總値約一七三億三三七二萬元，縣市敎育基金如田租房產，總値約三二億二九九二萬元，縣市社會敎育機關總値的十六億七一零八萬元，縣市立聯立私立中學總値的四零五億六九四二萬元，各縣市立小學總値約六二億九二八萬元總共損失總値約八九七億二零五七萬元。至於今後湘敎育復員計劃，計三部份：</p>
<p>高等教育復員</p>
<p>（一）高等敎育方面，恢復並充實省立農工商三專科學校，該三校戰前原均設南岳，今後將根據地理環境與需要，擬將商專與省立二職配合辦理，改設衡陽。工專與省立一職配合辦理，改設長沙。農專與省立四職配合辦理，改設　縣。敎育部並擬擴充國立湘大，增設農商兩學院。藍田之國立師範學院，將遷南岳或衡陽。</p>
<p>中等教育復員</p>
<p>（二）中等敎育方面，省立中等學校，戰前共卅八校（包括師範職校），其受戰爭影響停併或他遷者，統限於卅五年內一律復員。縣市立或聯立中等學校，戰前共九十八校，由各該縣市政府，督促於卅五年內一律恢復。私立中等學校，戰前共一八一校，今後為謀中等敎育之普及，私立中學，以不集中都市爲原則，其在戰時臨時聯合設立或停辦者，均須於今年內分別設立或籌備復校。</p>
<p>初等教育復員</p>
<p>（三）小學方面，戰前共三四六零四所，戰時損毀者達八三五零所，今後對被災各公私立小學及鄉保學校亟應恢復，同時淸理公私敎育產款，務期於今年底以前，各校全部恢復舊觀。湖南因戰前中小學敎育特別發達，故所愛之敵災損失亦甚動，今後復員亟需鉅款，切望中央能予以補助。因遷校與建築校舍二事，則非鉅款莫辦。（人）</p>
<h3>全國教育復員會議議決　組歐美教育訪問團　詳敘理由辦法請教部酌辦</h3>
<p>〔大華社重慶訊〕敎育部全國敎育復員會議，議決組織歐美敎育訪問團，詳叙理由及辦法，送請敎部斟酌辦理。茲錄如下：</p>
<p>理由</p>
<p>查此次聯合國作戰，英美二國之敎育方針及施設，甚能適應戰時環境。例如英美各大學，多能協助政府，加設各種軍事訓練班，並將大批人才供給政府徵用，即於原子彈之研究發明與運用，亦均由兩國學者之努力，始告成功，故爲明瞭戰時英美敎育眞相，我似有組織訪問團前往調查之必要，此其一。英美兩國對戰後復員之敎育計劃及方針，早有切實準備，其能供我國參老者必多，且其敎育設施，必能直接或間接影響世界黨故爲作我復員之借鑑，及明瞭此後世界敎育之趨向，我亦有以訪問團前往調查之必要，此其一二。我國苦戰八年，大後方及淪陷區在中央指導之下，艱苦奮鬥，厥續甚偉，此次全國敎育復員會議之決議及方針，必能代表我國抗戰建國之精神與政策，故以此項訪問團，宣揚我抗建精神於海外，亦屬必要，此其三。英美兩民主國之各大學及高等敎育機關，多係私立或敎會創辦，或雖由政府資助，然其行政及決策，均係獨立，戰後英美文化敎育事業之能與我協作者必多，故此時由政府及公私立大學協同派人前往努力聯絡工作，尤爲今日應有之步驟。</p>
<p>辦法</p>

<p>第一塲汕隊戰美空軍江灣隊，開賽後，形勢即成拉鋸局面，雙方射籃俱無虛發，林維聰與史麥達爲兩隊獲分之鑰，汕隊曾在極度緊張中以十一對七，十三對九領前，上半時完畢，各十八未分勝負。下半時局勢依然，汕隊未能超越而前，緊隨於後，結果五一對四六，美空軍江灣隊獲勝。</p>

<p>比賽開始，蘇聯一鼓作氣，東華無法覓門而入，在二十分鐘時，始見賈幼良猛射一記，愛斯普接而復失，韓龍海順勢一脚，應聲入網，紀錄遂開。乃不久蘇聯奧洛夫力射成功，扳成平手。東華大事進攻，韓龍海賴猛衝先獲一球，宋靈聖在二十碼以外，又放冷箭，上半時造成三對一。下半時開賽不久，李寗犯規，判罰十二碼，麥其當一蹴成功，三對二。東華再度努力，龍海逞威，如入無人之境高球挑入，四對二。旋又得李垚之妙傳，項上再開花，五比二，最後孫錦順鐵腿顯能，猛射建功，無何，笛聲已起，東華六對二旗開得勝。</p>

<h3>注意東九省的小學教育</h3>
<p>— 章華</p>
<p>東九省的局勢，於今可說得上明朗化了：共軍聽說已奉命撤退，中蘇交涉又頗爲圓滿，長春市瀋陽市已先後接收，中央銀行分行且已在長春開業，國軍空運東北業已開始。由於這一連串的事實，使東九省喜氣洋溢，是的，這又豈止於東九省而已，全國的人民都爲這陰霾之消，而感到歡忻與興奮，不過，我個人始終有一個隱憂，說來也許會有人笑，我的隱憂是深恐在這忙着接收的當兒，會忘記接收一批人，那就是整個東九省的小孩子。</p>
<p>記得抗戰初期，有一隻流行的救亡曲，是呌「打圓老家去」，這其中有力的喊呌說：「東北地方是我們的」，十四年來，我們並沒有忘了這句話，現在我想呌：「東九省的人民是我們的」，自然，小孩子也在其中，也許這不成爲一個問題，然而讓我們一按十四年來，敵人對東北同胞，所加於精神上的桎梏，就够使我們驚怕了，我所以特別地提出東九省的小孩子，一則是東九省淪陷得最久，受毒最深，一則是小孩子具有了最大的可塑性，可以要圓就圓，要方就方，前幾天大公報上載着戈衍棣君的「與山岸多嘉子對談」，其中說她在浦東辦了個幼稚園，還有中小學，我眞擔心，不知她們敎些什麼？對於這，凡是關心中國命運的同胞，都不會加以信任的吧！</p>
<p>事實上是怎樣呢？且讓我鈔一段文章，這事發生在虹口一個經接收後的日本商業學校，現改爲市立施高塔路小學，忙着報名的時候，一位先生，看見我們進去，不禁感慨系之的說：「看吧！奴化敎育的結果，這一個下午已經絡絡續續有過十幾個小朋友來了，喊他們塡報名單，寫到年歲，總把「歲」字寫成「才」字，「總計一下，收到二十張報名單，只有碩果僅存的一個人算把歲字寫對的。」而且這不但虹口如此，舊租界上也如此，不但小學如此，中學大學也如此，敵人整個佔領上海，實際上不過四年，而東九省已是整整地十四年了，我們不說什麼文化淪亡的危險，也不必數歷來文敎陸夷與國家興亡有什麼關係，可是當着這大時代，當着在這舉國步伐一致向前邁進以及全世界都走向新道路的時候，我們總不能不想想奴化敎育可能產生的惡果吧！假如戰爭再延長十年，我們被敵人朦蔽了的同胞，可能也是戰爭的罪魁，有一天會以鋒鏑指向祖國，這並不是過甚其詞，如今幸而已勝利了，如何使自己的同胞成爲和平的虔誠信徒與一個和平的衛護者，這是値得我們深慮與努力的，尤其對小朋友。</p>
<p>不下種沒有收穫，沒有民族的幼苗，老壯死盡了，這國家也就完了。有了幼苗而全是些有毒的「嬰粟」，那麼，在未來的日子裏，有一個黑暗時代，一定可以預卜，假如我們不澄淸這些幼苗中的毒質，告訴你，黑暗就在前面。共實這又不僅止是學校的責任，除了敎師外，每一個孩子的長輩，在這光天化日之下，應該絮絮地說些呱國以及祖國這槐沃土的故事，末了，我喊：「小學敎師到東九省去！」</p>

<h3>美軍總部消滅黑市買賣　軍用藥品予以沒收</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本埠美軍總部昨日發表，該軍罪案調查處爲謀繼續努力，消滅上海之黑市貿易起見，於本星期四，聯合市警察局人員，將本市藥房三家所貯原供軍用之藥品，予以沒收。惟此項藥品之數量究有若干，則並未宣布，但其中包括若干盤尼西靈，少量之硫化物藥劑，治療傷寒及霍亂之針藥，及若干維太命藥片。</p>
<p>美軍調查處稱，該處早已認爲本埠若干藥房有出售美國軍用藥劑之嫌疑，自經積極偵查，業已一週，而搜索所得，則以此次爲最多。去年除夕，曾抄獲少量之乳粉，咖啡，糖，麥片，白塔油，及巧格力糖等物，且有軍用衣着。該部並曾查抄一私人住宅，搜獲大批配給於美國軍士之糖果。彼等於搜查朱葆三路某酒吧時，又獲大批軍配食品，該酒吧當被取銷其准許美軍入內之執照。星期四所查抄之藥肆中，有一家之店主被捕，將續加偵查。</p>

<p>首批平價油，刻以出貨手續稽廷，乃不得不展至十日左右始可發售。至前次所傳油價，現經改訂，致略有出入，計菜油爲每市斤一百二十五元，荳油生油每市斤一百四十元。</p>
<h3>為愷尼斯誌哀　英美艦下半旗</h3>
<p>英新聞處訊，昨日停泊浦江中之英美軍艦，一律下半旗，爲愷尼斯海軍上將誌哀。按愷尼斯海軍上將，患病三年，於去歲十二月二十六日不治逝世，享年七十有三。愷尼斯上將以於第一次世界大戰中轟炸德國潛艇根據地徐布魯齊而聞名。</p>
<h3>昨商談未獲結果工方要求待遇公平</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕美商上海電力公司楊樹浦發電廠職工，因待遇糾紛，於前日下午五時許一致罷工，滬西滬北數處斷電達一小時餘，損失電力二萬瓦特。本市黨政軍警當局聞訊紛紛派員前往調處，勞方接受勸導，旋即復工。勞資雙方於昨日下午二時在社會局開會商討。</p>
<p>工方要求實行協定</p>
<p>首由職工代表與市黨部代表王先青作非正式商討，嗣總工會代表周學湘，警察局代表傳少偉，淞滬警備司令部滬東區稽查所代表程炎仁，及公用局代表　鄭錫虁，資方副總裁費利思，人事組長魯根均出席，勞方代表計楊樹浦發電廠七人，斐倫路配電所四人，南京路總公司四人，由王先靑主席，勞方代表提出意見，並書面提供去年九年二十九日雙方協定之十條，要求資方立即實行，並確定具體辦法，計（一）同職同薪，（二）改善福利（三）工資調整，（四）增加工資，（五）急需時可借養老金百分之七十五，（六）養老金原定十五年改爲十二年，（七）養老金辦法修正後，呈政一府核准，（八）舊職員有任僞職爲害公司者，由勞方檢舉屬實，公司不再錄用，（九）發給戰時慰藉金，雙方同意保留，（十）公司當局承認歐陽祖潤周維新等十七人爲代表，在未正式開始談判前，由社會局張振遠報告以前調解經過。</p>
<p>工資問題未獲結論</p>
<p>繼由王先青按序先討論同職同薪問題，資方費利思發言公司已在逐漸調整中，唯有許多困難，以致不能迅速完成，勞方代表臚舉事實，白俄與華工待遇不平等，費利思當即表示，調查後立刻調整。次討論工資問題，　氏表示底薪已予調整，當時曾遭各方攻擊，故不允重加調整，社會局張振遠提出有關工資問題數點，當由費氏答覆，但始終無一具體辦法，會塲空氣，益形緊張，由王先靑提議，下星期一下午二時，繼續再談。</p>
<p>中外職工薪給懸殊</p>
<p>據悉，現電力公司華籍職工薪水每月三萬元至四萬元，佔百分之七十，四萬至七萬元，占百分之二十，七萬元以上者僅百分之十，而外籍職工薪給常在七八十萬至百餘萬元，故全廠外籍員工僅十分之一，而薪水反占全廠薪水總數之半。</p>
<p>法商電車亦提要求</p>
<p>法商電車公司　例於五日發　，前日公司突表示將延至七日發薪，並對工友要求之調整工資，未予切實答復，故全體職工，正體釀怠工。社會局得　後，由張振遠馳往調解，公司當局允即籌款如期發薪，但勞方須　　去年十二月二十七日社會局新定觀整之工資標準，不得過份要求，昨下午二時許勞方代表四人至社會局商討其他有關事項，怠工或將不致發生。</p>

<h3>加強運輸救濟品我向英租借船隻救濟總署稱不致損害航權</h3>
<p>關於行政院善後救濟總署利用英國船隻，載運救濟物品，上海航業界以該署讓渡航權，使英船將在我國沿海口岸及長江各地行，經濟部資源委員會，現已決定在滬設立上海機器廠，其辦公處已擇定九江路市銀行三樓，該廠現先成立第二三廠，即爲由經濟部蘇浙皖區特派員所接收之敵偽機廠中所移交者。計（一）戈登路大陸機器廠，（二）河間路豐田自動車廠，（三）塘山路昌和製作所。現上海機器廠已在辦理移交，日內即將開工，先行製造工作母機及汽車零件·至廠長一職亦已任命前雲南昆明中央機器廠長貝季瑤担任，現貝氏業已到滬，正開始籌備復工事宜。方進行簽訂一條約，租借英國商輪在中國沿海內河運輸救濟物資，蓋以今後聯總將平均每天有救濟船隻一艘來華，每艘所載之物資的八千噸至一萬噸，則每月約可有卅萬噸救濟物資運抵中國，爲使該項物資迅速轉運至我國各地，以加速復員起見乃決定向英政府租借船隻，以加强運輸。該發言人並稱，相信此項條約簽訂後，絕不至有損我國主權，並決不妨碍我沿海內河之航運。</p>

<p>登記船舶嚴格審查</p>
<p>交通部航政局，鑒於各航商聲請登記之船舶，其中確屬於正當業主者，固屬多數，但其中亦有少數船舶係屬來歷不明，故該局如再發現凡以敵僞所有之船隻，佔爲己有而聲請登記者，須嚴加處罰，因此現該局對於登記證件之審查條件，極爲嚴格。</p>
<h3>查點倉庫尙需時日</h3>
<p>江海關查點倉庫工作，自十一月九日展開以來，瞬將兩月，迄目前止，已查竣倉庫，共計七百餘所，據關係方面估計，是項查點任務，尚需時三個月，始克完畢。至未經查點之敵偽倉庫，爲數尚多，海關於原接收機構交出後，即繼續進行查點，至華商倉庫，以及銀錢業倉庫所藏之物資，現亦開始點查中，查非敵僞所有者，將予處理發還。</p>

<h3>廿九個囚犯已處決　只剩他一個未死　含冤楊文道但願早日出獄</h3>
<p>— 本報記者平齊</p>
<p>十年前，在中山秀雄血案中被牽連，而遭羅織入罪判處死刑的楊文道，最近籲請平反寃獄，已引起了各方廣大的正義感和同情心。本報前天把這個「犯人」的血淚史呈獻於讀者之前，今天再把獄中訪問楊文道的經過記在下面：</p>
<p>慘無人道一字一淚</p>
<p>置身在提籃橋上海監獄陰森的灰色高圍牆裏，好像走進了一個「死城」，連氣都彷彿透不過來。走廊的四週都是沉重的鐵門，獄卒靜默地往來走着。我們就在一間空無所有的房間裏，等候着判處死刑已經十年的楊文道。</p>
<p>突然，一陣淸脆而無情的鑰匙聲響，鐵門被拉開了。幾個法警擁了一個人出來，他穿着灰布的棉囚衣，棉袴。身材矮小，面色焦黃而蒼老。他的頭頂已經禿了，但是這個飽經憂患者的眼光，却是興奮的。</p>
<p>法警高聲對我說：「這就是楊文道！」</p>
<p>十年來，祇有他的兒子漢枝，每星期能够來和他隔了鐵柵談三五分鐘話。這一次，記者和他相見，也許還是第一次的聽見同情者的聲音。他興奮地說，我是二十五年四月十九日，被巡捕房裏日本包打聽綁票一樣的架走，被關在狄斯威路。每天十二點鐘，他們就把我吊到四馬路總巡捕房的特別間去上刑罰，把我的眼睛紥住，再把我綁在老虎凳上，鼻孔裏灌冷水，一定要我招認是奉了政府的命令做暗殺黨，專門暗殺日本人。他們把我的衣服剝掉，呌我跪在兩塊尖銳的小石子上，上半身還要挺得筆直……天哪，我的膝蓋都爛了！」</p>
<p>禍不單行燒個精光</p>
<p>一直到十月二日判處死刑之前，六個多月，他天天過着任人拳打脚踢的日子。判決之後，關到了提籃橋，於是他就變成了引頸待戳的「死囚一了。</p>
<p>遍體鱗傷的身體。戴上了鐐銬，他每天除掉可以在監裏兜三次圈子之外，不准離開監房一步。儘管他有滿腹寃屈，但這裏是運說話都禁止的。</p>
<p>他的家在塘山路，離開監獄很近，然而在他看來是多麼遙遠「八一三」，熾烈的砲火，提籃橋牢監的銅墻鐵壁安然無恙，而塘山路他的家倒燒得精光，日本人佔領了上海。</p>
<p>關在監獄RD房子五樓的死刑囚犯一共三十個人，不時三三兩兩的用大汽車送出去處決。在大雪紛飛的嚴冬，漢枝在天還沒有亮，就趕到南市刑塲去等候。每逢看見提籃橋來的大車子，便心如刀割的仔細張望，每天從上午八點到下午三點，一連有十多天總算沒有他的父親在內。</p>
<p>卅個囚犯死剩一人</p>
<p>楊文道在等着，同監的人一個個出去最後只剩兩個人了。一天早晨，那個「第二十九號」犯人忽然有人送酒來給他，他的死期已經到了。楊文道便和他痛飲大醉。「二十九號」當天就送上了「大車子」。如今，祇有楊文道一個人了。</p>
<p>然而楊文道始終沒有輪到，事實是：監獄當局知道他是寃枉的，所以在日本人進佔上海的時候，沒有把這宗案卷透露出來。</p>
<p>鐵窗外照着淡淡的夕陽，一隊穿灰棉襖的囚犯無聲地走了過去，楊文道含着眼淚說：「十年痛苦，天保佑總算有伸寬的日子了。我什麼都不想，我祇希望能够早一點看到我的孩子們—我祇希望早些回家」。</p>
<h3>拓展界路浙江路市府限本年內拆屋　由房主自負拆卸之責</h3>
<p>（本報訊）市府以界路與浙江路密邇北站，爲交通要道，而路面太狹，以致車輛往來，極感不便。頃已決定將界路拓寬至闊三十公尺，浙江路拓寬至闊二十公尺。關於浙江路拓寬工作，聞當局正攷慮先就蘇州河以北及福州路以南兩段，先行施工。記者頃自市府方面探悉：該兩路障碍拓寬計劃之房屋，均限於三十五年年底之前拆除完竣，且須由房主自負拆卸之實，而由警察局加以監督。並聞該二路於拓寬之後，沿路房屋自必因交通便利而蒙受利益，財政局將向房主徵收相當費用。至於人民因拓路而所受之房地損失，則市府尚未決定補償辦法。</p>
<p>展築北西藏路</p>
<p>本市黃浦區各幹路車馬擁擠，交通困難，該局除積極修理各路破壞路面，並開始拓寬界路及跑馬應路面外，聞現正計劃展築北西藏路啣接宋公園路，以便東北通界路，直達北車站，俾利車站與滬西交通。</p>

<h3>迎中電劇團</h3>
<p>— 李琳</p>
<p>在上海劇運趨向低潮的時候，中電劇團已由重慶起程東下的消息，對我們簡直是一帖興奮劑，它給我們帶來了新的力量與希望，正如在前錢危急的時候，突然趕到了一支生力軍一樣。</p>
<p>無可諱言的，上海劇壇正在遭遇着一個空前的危機，外國影片搶去我們許多觀衆與劇院，然而這種危機並不是不可挽救的，外國影片闊別四載以後，它自然另有一種瘋魔的吸引力，可是這究竟是一時的現象，等觀衆對外國影片的狂熱稍爲低落以後，話劇仍然是可能重行抬頭的，外國影片的吸引力並不是不可抗拒的，然而必須看我們的努力如何，電影與戲劇本來各有其不可磨減的優點，她們同有存在的理由，她們的存在因爲她們有着各自的特質。只要看最近上海僅存的三個話劇院子營業的興盛，就是個好的證明。　不過劇烈的競爭是不可避免的，現在僅存三個話劇院子，所以能與電影院爭衡，是因爲他們所選劇目的優秀，演員陣容的堅强，所以將來我們祗要注意到演出水準的提高，話劇並不是沒有前途的，至於劇塲的恐慌也不過是暫時的現象，商人是近視的，唯利是圖的，祗要我們的觀衆重回到我們的劇院來，話劇營業能與電影相等甚至超過電影以後，劇院是不成問題。</p>
<p>擺在我們眼前的問題是怎樣提高我們的演出水準，在商業化以後的上海劇壇，因爲劇國的不斷增加，最盛時代有十二個之多，因此在演員的素質大爲降低，人力也分散了，工作態度也不嚴肅了，所以一遇外國電影的勁敵，便感到極大的威脅，因此目前我們必須着重提高我們的演出水準與改善我們工作的熊度。</p>
<p>久聞中電劇團在重慶的盛譽，不但所演出的劇目的選擇極其愼重，同時演員的陣容亦極整齊，最可貴的在劇團里彌漫着極濃厚的學術空氣，在工作方面保有嚴肅的作風，再加上劇團的領導人張駿祥先生是國內少有的全能人才，這眞是我們未來上海劇壇的一支有力的生力軍。</p>
<p>「中電」在重慶曾經演過的戲劇有：「萬世師表」，「大地回春」，「正氣歌」，「山城故事」，「金玉滿堂」等劇，他們演出的特點，在演員方面注重平均發展，不以一二個名演員爲號召，而特別注意到演員間的互相合作，他們的演員在演技方面都非常平均，素質非常優秀不像一般劇團的參差不齊。</p>
<p>聽說「中電」的團員是乘車到沅陵轉長沙經漢口由長江東下，現在已過長沙；天槪在一週以內可以抵達上海，同時張駿祥先生已先一月抵滬籌備演出事宜，並羅致優秀人才參加「中電」，這樣「中電」的陣容將更堅强，我熱切地希望很快地看到「中電」的演出，以解我們的渴慕。</p>
<p>在「中電」抵滬以前，謹先表達我們歡迎的熱忱，並且希望「中電』不僅是我們的生力軍，同時也是我們的表率，與我們聯成一個堅强的陣綫，來搶救上海劇壇目前的危機。</p>
<h3>憶重慶</h3>
<p>— 沙桐</p>
<p>重慶是一個突出在長江與嘉陵江之間的山城，常年很少見太陽，走路必須爬山坡，劇人影人生活和普通公務人員一樣的困苦，因之勝利一到，大家都想快快東下。可是，記者下來得最早，而對重慶却也想念得最厲害，在重慶生活了八年，可以說苦鬥了八年，我們不僅鍛鍊出了一種新的生活方法，且鍛鍊出了一種新的工作方法，譬如說，在大轟炸和所謂連續不斷的疲勞轟炸期間，我們不僅要躱防空洞，而且要學着救護的工作，要保護器材，而且要拍新聞片要和用躱防空洞的時問讀劇本。又譬如說，在物價高漲，物資不够分配的時候，大家如何組織和管理伙食團，不僅自已要買菜，還要種菜，甚至養猪。這種種生活是够苦的，可是你回想起來，却實在是够有味的呵。</p>
<p>在重慶是很少娛樂和消遣的地方的，老實說，就是有，也非我輩劇影人所可涉足的。因之據影塲附近的小茶館店，便做了影劇人的俱樂部了。在那裏三五人一桌，而且還有躺椅，有的休息，有的讀劇本，有的開會討論演出方法，有的寫文章，有的竟在那裏會客，餓了可以呌幾碗「担担麵」吃，「担担麵」是四川的特產，又經濟又美味，謝添一連可吃五六碗。這種茶館店，建築自然很簡陋，也許就是大黃桶樹蔭底下，用竹蓆搭起的一架草棚，或是一所傾斜的古屋，可是女明星們如白楊等却是經常的座上客。所以重慶的影迷們要瞻仰女明星，只要常跑攝影塲附近或是國泰大戲院對門的小茶館，總是可以達到目的的。可是「女明星」道三個字在重慶並不引人注意，因爲她們本身就很平常，素朴得像一個普通的女學生。</p>
<p>我說過在重慶走路必須爬山坡，我們過一條江，有人說是盪秋千，下了坡又上坡，可不是盪秋千嗎？那些山城並不是洋房的樓梯，自然高低不平，因之生活在重慶的小姐和太太們就很少着高跟鞋的。我們倒可以看見女明星們穿靴子，却沒有看見她們穿高跟鞋。因之有好幾齣戲裏扮演摩登女性的演員，竟有不習慣高跟鞋的台步。</p>
<p>在轟炸期間，拍戲工作實在無法推動，夏季的重慶固然有太陽，但是正是轟炸的好天氣，因爲轟炸，電力電光的供給便發生問題。霧季固然不怕轟炸，却又缺少太陽，而電力的供給仍不如理想。因之影片的生產落後，是必然的事。相反的，話戲却得長足的進展。轟炸期間排戲，霧季一到，各個劇團便同時在山城活躍起來。</p>
<p>雖在一切物質條件都感困難的情形下生活，重慶的影人劇人，是能更堅强的生活和工作下去的，因是我十分想念重慶。</p>
<h3>話劇的致命傷—場地荒</h3>
<p>— 君宜</p>
<p>最近一個月來從內地趕來的話劇工作人員已有不少，但是他們至今徬徨歧途，沒有事情可做變成「英雄無用武之地」。塲地的缺乏，已形成目前話劇事業最嚴重的問題，和平之前，全市話劇院在十家以上，但目前逐漸滅少到僅有三家，說句良心話，這幾年來在上海「吃話劇飯」的大多數都能在自己的本位上埋頭苦幹，很不容易地抓住了廣大的顧客，勝利了，他們却反而失去了原來的崗位！</p>
<p>在內地，話劇已離不開大衆，同樣地大衆也無法離開話劇。抗戰期中，牠已儘量地發揮了話劇本身的力量，因此也引起了當局的注意，有好多劇本便榮獲了政府的嘉獎，許多工作人員也得到了在戰時政府所珍惜的人力物力的帮助，因此好幾天前碰到一位內地來的話劇人員，他一到上海便奇怪爲什麼這許多年來此地的話劇依然如此受人淡漠，相反地一般地方戲劇倒覺得已顯著的有了進步。其實這位先生是患的短視，他何嘗看見四五個月以前的蓬勃氣象呢！</p>
<p>由於西片來源的漸見暢通，電影院商發覺了經營話劇不但太傷腦筋，而且也沒有開映電影的利息優厚，便毫不留情的把那批話劇團體一脚踢了出去，雖然他們知道這許多工作者也曾爲他們出過力，發過財，眞像李健吾先生所說的：「於是我們就倒在這般商人的功利心窩了」！其實這般電影院商也是患的短視，在這自己本國影片一時尙不能大量產生的局面之下，這些西片是否能够保險將來不會使觀衆反胃，便是一個疑問？在上海的一批內地劇作家的行囊中，有的是豐富的寶藏，這裏的商人又何不拿出鑰匙替他們打開來呢？</p>
<p>兩月之前，就聽說有把敵僞方面接收過來的幾家戲院，預備供給內地歸來的人員應用，且已成立了一個公營劇院管理委員會，這倒確是塲地荒中一個天大的喜訊，希望過去上海的話劇班底，能够彼此合作起來，一定可以產生燦爛的前途，成千百萬的話劇觀衆不妨拭目以待！</p>
<h3>「明末遺恨」</h3>
<p>昨日中午靜安寺路康樂酒家有一個集會，由蔣伯誠吳開先萬墨林等宴請話劇京劇界名流，及中央黨政重要官員，爲上海市蒙難同志會事業基金籌募委員會籌備公演話劇京劇，到有鈕永建潘公展王曉籟，及梅蘭芳，周信芳，張駿祥，顧仲彝，費穆，徐蘇靈諸氏，商討籌備演劇募款事宜，蔣伯誠夫人熱心籌劃，頗爲活躍，當時即將劇目及演出辦法決定，周信芳當塲一口答允演出明末遺恨等名戲，話劇界亦決定由各劇團分別參加演出，「中電」劇團如果趕得上，即以「萬世師表」參加。届時上海戲迷們，可以一飽眼福。</p>
<h3>新片短評</h3>
<p>— 萊明</p>
<p>在近來上海之好萊塢電影，已源源而至，使每一個影迷們覺得非常之興奮；但據內地來函，謂：尤以陪都所映之好萊塢影片爲最多，但在滬上所映之影片，大多爲陪都所映過之影片，在近幾天來，在滬上有若干十影片，可以來介紹一下。</p>
<p>一　民族魂</p>
<p>是一張値得介紹的佳片；此片女主角爲愛琳鄧，男主角爲愛倫馬歇爾，劇情全部使用倒叙法，叙美國軍醫院中，一老年英國護士，回憶她丈夫，在英國倫敦出世後，她帶了心愛的兒子，遠居美國；後兒子長大，及時，第二次世界大戰爆發，於是她把兒子，忠勇爲國獻身，自己加入醫院中服務，全片宗旨，是一個偉大的時代母性。愛琳鄧的演技，也相當的成就，此片値得爲我國母性一看的。</p>
<p>二　夢裏征魂</p>
<p>是一部法國人民，在淪陷區中，愛國的熱忱史，本片主角，爲亨茀萊鮑嘉，以前在「孤城虎將」中，已給我們很深刻的形像，在本片中，當然有更好的演技，此片也是使用倒叙法，來叙述劇情；故事的開端，爲自由法空軍在英國基地發辛納隊長（克勞特里立斯），對一記者，叙述關於該隊隊員之來歷。</p>
<p>馬勒克（亨茀萊鮑嘉）與另四個法國靑年，越獄逃亡海外；經過在巨輪上一塲惡鬥，終算他們平靜地到達英國，於是加入了自由法國空軍，替祖國効力，在最後，馬勒克因奮勇空戰而陣亡之一幕，尤為觀衆感激流淚，該片爲我國人所爭觀之片。</p>
<p>三　桃花宮</p>
<p>茀勒亞斯坦，麗泰海華絲，這兩個好萊塢影壇上的紅星，尤茀勒是好萊塢的舞皇，他那滑稽的臉，與輕快的步子；使每一僩觀衆所稱讚；麗泰海華絲在過去「碧血黃沙」中，她的妖艷，已風魔了多少的影迷們，在本片中，麗泰飾一富商之女，她突然每天接到一位無名字靑年的追求書，到結果，那些追求書，是由她的父親所寫的，弄得一塲哄堂大笑。茀勒飾一無業之舞術家，無意中他和富商之女，弄假成眞，而結爲夫婦。在此片中之新歌，新舞，尤爲出色，故此片是一部歌舞風趣片而已。</p>
<p>四　阿利巴巴四十大盜</p>
<p>自野女郎一片，在滬獻映後，已哄動全滬觀衆。本片主角，與野女郎相同，女主角，爲瑪莉亞蒙丹，男主角爲强霍爾。在戰後，好萊塢各大影片公司，都在招兵買馬，其中環球公司爲最佳，在發掘新星中，以瑪莉亞蒙丹爲最紅，强霍爾過去在「暴風刧」及「美人魚」中演技，已相當的老練，他那棕色皮膚，高高的身子，眞配飾阿利巴巴之要角呢。</p>
<p>全片叙述，小亞細亞中之一巴格達王子，被叛國奸臣所淪落爲四十大盜中之阿利巴巴；十年後阿年已雙十，立志復仇，經過許多的困難，才報了不共戴天之仇；其中以阿利巴巴呌喊開山門之一幕，尤爲動人；除瑪莉亞蒙丹，及强霍爾外，杜漢貝飾但密克一角也相當成就，此片同「月宮賽盒」爲同工異曲之佳作。</p>
<h3>電影發明史</h3>
<p>電影眞是我們太熟悉的朋友了，可是大家很少知道她的來歷，更少記得她的生日，一般人總以爲她原籍是美國，其實她降生在距今洽好五十年前的法國，第一個發明電影的人死於窮困成了無名英雄，那成功的發明人十二年前還活着，電影從試騐成功到現在，歷時五十寒暑經過了「黑白「到彩色」，「無聲」到「開口」多種的改革才有今日，不久的將來還可能有「立體」「嗅覺」和「無綫電傳的「睹影聞聲」」等等的發展，本年十二月二十六日星期三，適逢電影發明成功五十週年紀念，得到電影實惠的影片商人，影院老闖届時似乎應該表示一番才對。</p>
<h3>關於「離離草」</h3>
<p>— 秋水</p>
<p>從劇作者的筆下寫出這末一段故事：在東北一九三二年日寇的武裝移民輪到某個小鎭上的時候，他們强佔了馬順·蘇嘉的屋子，他們殺死了二個人民說是義勇軍，同時他們提心吊胆着義勇軍的攻擊，呌做黑田移民班長的一次捉到了義勇軍司令爬山虎張文西，他要馬順認辨眞假，馬順乘機放了爬山虎，於是呌崔大吉的韓國人被黑田找出了證據加以槍殺。</p>
<p>第二天槍決輪到了馬順·蘇嘉·崔承福身上，夜里他們放火作爲訊號，義勇軍衝進來救了他們，但崔承福已被日寇槍擊死了</p>
<p>離離草里的人們生活是因苦而被壓迫的，也是鬥爭的，離離草里的人們的生活，是東北同胞的實際生活，現在東北重入了我們的懷抱，回憶過去如一塲惡夢醒來，的確我們還値得一看，過去我們的民族如何不幸，我們的人民如何窒息，則我們現在將怎樣自愛·自強。</p>
<p>鳳子的蘇嘉是一個新女性，她年靑，但空氣使她似乎變得大了好幾歲。穆宏的馬順還過得過去。喬奇的黑田，刻畫出他的刁滑陰險，同時小動作也描摩入徵，在演技方面這是比較最滿意的一個。</p>
<p>演「—我—」的在漪，據說是「了不起的人物」。這是一個新人在演技方面處處顯出她的生嫩，她處處不能表現出她的能幹與了不起，在最後一幕她指揮着怎樣辦，怎樣辦，她的聲音幾乎是像開着一張破壞了的留聲片，但從她的努力與認眞，未始不是一個有希望的人物。</p>
<p>前幾幕在沉悶的空氣中過去，在最後一幕開頭就有轉變，但那個小偷登場以後，文明戲的氣氛太濃原了，雖欲改變空氣，這末一着，未嘗不是白璧之瑕吧？</p>
<h3>好萊塢　影星榮歸記</h3>
<p>— 影呆</p>
<p>重上銀箱開拍新片</p>
<p>大多數從軍的影人，而今已復員，並首先回美，再度到好萊塢從事水銀燈生活了。我們可舉幾個在下面。</p>

<h3>雜感</h3>
<p>— 莫言</p>
<p>關於軍人看白戲的問題兩星期來已有不少的記載和討論，同時那些所造成的事件和糾紛也已在本市的軍政當局處理中，也許不久就會規定辦法，只是怕「辦法」未必就能算是這問題的解決，因為這裏面包括了軍人待遇，駐軍管轄，劇塌票價等若干基本問題是誰也一下不能立刻就完全解決的。我們只希望情况能逐漸改善，也許十年，二十年以後這問題已經不存在了，說起來這種問題以及表現出來的靑兄究竟是使軍民從精神上就永遠有了界限而對於「軍」也永遠有了不愉快的「令人側目」感覺。至於在上海各戲院，所發生的事情是否有礙國際觀瞻也是不待言的，所以戲院只吃了限前虧，最後的責任還不是落在我們中華民國身上？</p>

<h3>市政建議跑馬廳應闢為體育場</h3>
<p>— 羅自强</p>
<p>跑馬廳接收以後，就轉租給美軍當局，難道因爲這大塊空地不能派用塲嗎？</p>
<p>請看外灘公園，每日早晨擠滿了自强不息的市民，在舒拳練腿。上海有四百餘萬人，終日在人氣中工作，環境使他們無野外活動，大都身體孱弱，容易致病。</p>
<p>跑馬廳當全市中心，塲地空敞，交通便利甚宜闢爲公衆體育塲，俾全市市民得以調節其身心疲勞，鍛鍊體魄。希望當局收回自用。收回以後，周圍可滿植花　，以絕塵囂，外圈仍爲跑馬道，再闢一圈爲人行道，以供市民跑步之用；當由塲地，可分爲若干號，內某幾號爲足球塲，鋼球塲，籃球塲，某幾號爲太極拳塲，摔角塲，拳擊塲，以及其他國術機械鍛練甚至翻筯斗等等，聘請名師敎授，以喚起同胞的尙武精神，掙脫東亞病夫的汚號。</p>
<p>强國必先强身，賢明的當局諒能建矚高瞻。再我國軍隊素質甚弱，未始非平日對於操練疏忽之故。日寇雖已投降，然其昔日駐軍每日操練不較之精神，甚堪吾軍政長官採取此法，行之當見大效。</p>
<h3>取締拉客野鷄　勿以小事而疏忽</h3>
<p>報載本市警察局，於元且日起取締所有的嚮導社和按摩浴室等變相賣淫所，這是一個賢明的舉措，從此可以救出了許多人，免他們再墮入苦海，眞是功德無量；不過還有一件很小的事，希望賢明的當局注意，就是在南京路大新公司門首一帶，每天下午，不到二三點鐘，即有一班被人們視爲最低微的野鷄，在那邊往來的拉生意，外國兵士是她們底目標，不惜用着任何的醜態來獻媚，我因爲時常跑過那邊，每次總看見，其常的氣憤，覺得我們現在已是一等强國了，在這號稱世界大都市的上海，而且尤是最熱鬧的地方，有這種丟臉的事發生，有礙觀瞻，又是大喪國體，請主管當局立即嚴加取締。不要以爲微小的事而疏忽，這正是有關整個國家名譽的大事呢。</p>

        <h1>1946.01.06</h1>
<h3>The First Batch of National Army Troops Airlifted Arrived in Changchun from Beiping</h3>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 5th] Military sources say: Chairman Chiang presented cash as a New Year's gift to officers and soldiers of the 13th and 52nd Armies currently stationed in the Northeast, and the 92nd and 94th Armies currently stationed in Peiping and Tianjin. It is said that each officer received 2,000 yuan, and each soldier received 1,000 yuan.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 5th (Urgent Telegram)] Our first batch of airlifted troops arrived in Changchun from Peiping this afternoon. This marks the beginning of the large-scale airlift of the National Army to the Northeast in history. Subsequent troops will arrive by air in succession.</p>
<p>[United Press, Peiping, 5th] Authoritative sources have learned: The airlift of the National Army to the Northeast began this morning. The 2nd Brigade of the Security Army under General Du Yuming took transport planes from Peiping to Changchun. The 94th Army under General Mou Tingfang is expected to depart from the Tianjin area within a day or two.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Jinzhou, 4th] After Director Du received a telegram from Soviet military officers, he decided to dispatch a construction team to be stationed in Shenyang and appointed Deputy Commander Peng Bisheng as the director of the construction team. Peng, along with staff, secretaries, and 41 attendants, departed from Jinzhou by car on the morning of the 4th to Shenyang.</p>
<p>[Another Telegram] Director Du Yuming took a special train this morning along Yixian and Qinghemen to inspect Fuxin County.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hankou, 4th] Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Northeast Security Command, General Liang Huasheng, led personnel from the Cadre Training Corps and arrived in Hankou on the 2nd, passing through Hunan from Kunming.</p>
<p>[United Press, Peiping, 5th] The situation in the Northeast has become complicated again today. Although some provincial and municipal receiving officials continue to leave Peiping to take office in the Northeast, the movement of the main force of the troops is still obstructed. Only one column has moved from Yixian to Fuxian. The feeling here is that the next level of Sino-Soviet negotiations cannot be decided until Special Envoy Jiang Jingguo returns from Moscow to report on his mission.</p>
<h3>General Wedemeyer States at Press Conference That He Will Assist Us in Transporting Troops to the Northeast; New 6th Army Will Be Transported to Shenyang by Water in a Week</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper] General Wedemeyer, Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Forces in the China Theater, held a reception for Chinese and foreign journalists at the Construction Building yesterday morning at 11:00 AM.</p>
<p>Regarding the transport of Chinese troops to the Northeast, General Wedemeyer said that so far, Chinese troops have not arrived in Shenyang and Harbin to take over. The Du Yuming army has now reached 25 miles outside the suburbs of Shenyang. Wedemeyer also stated that he has the authority to transport Chinese troops to the Northeast. The New 6th Army is currently making preparations such as cold-proofing and vaccinations, and will be transported by water from Shanghai to Shenyang in a week. The total number of people is 26,000. If the weather is not affected, it is planned to land at Huludao. Otherwise, they will land at Qinhuangdao. As for the two tasks of transporting Chinese troops to the Northeast and repatriating Japanese to their country, General Wedemeyer is preparing to combine the two parts of the work into one.</p>
<p>Also, 5,000 U.S. Marine Corps personnel will come to China from Guam to take over defense in the Northeast, so that personnel at high-altitude points can return home. Army personnel will also continue to come here. It is reported that the result of U.S. military recruitment in China is that many personnel are willing to stay in China to work and are very interested in China.</p>
<p>The method for the U.S. military to sell military supplies to China after the war is still being discussed by the two governments. General Wedemeyer said that he cannot express any opinions at this time. Military supplies listed as surplus materials are announced by him, but all subsequent implementation rights belong to the U.S. Military Surplus Materials Committee. The U.S. government may hand over six Liberty ships to the Chinese government, and the full power of their use belongs to the Chinese government. However, the most urgent need at present is the coal transportation problem. If the factories in this city resume work, a large amount of coal is urgently needed, and Qingdao also needs about 15,000 tons of coal per month.</p>
<p>Regarding the handling of the Jiangwan Airport by the U.S. Air Force and the Chinese government, according to General Wedemeyer: The British Air Force has completed the control of the use of the Jiangwan Airport, and the Chinese Aviation Commission is responsible for maintaining the airport's construction and other matters.</p>
<p>The personnel currently wearing U.S. military uniforms with the Chinese character "中" on their arms belong to the China National Aviation Corporation.</p>
<p>A reporter asked General Wedemeyer what he thought of the articles published in the "Stars and Stripes" that attacked the work of the U.S. military headquarters. General Wedemeyer replied: I like such articles. This is a great opportunity for them to freely express their opinions. I also welcome criticisms from all parties, as long as they are constructive. At the same time, I have also received a lot of private letters from U.S. soldiers and officers, praising and thanking me for my work, but I am unwilling to publish them, because articles of attack often attract attention. Regarding the tragic case of the U.S. military truck accident on Xiafei Road last time, General Wedemeyer has not yet received other reports. General Wedemeyer admitted that this was a U.S. military truck, but there are still 440 similar vehicles in this city used by the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration and the Chinese military.</p>
<p>General Chennault has not yet informed General Wedemeyer when he will come to China. If General Chen comes here in an official capacity, he will definitely receive notification from the U.S. government and Chairman Chiang.</p>
<p>Colonel Whitehouse, Marshal Marshall's economic and financial advisor, has not yet determined the date of his arrival in China and is currently receiving instructions in Washington.</p>
<p>Reports that General Wedemeyer will go to Chongqing to participate in the Chinese political conference are inaccurate. General Wedemeyer will soon travel to North China, but because U.S. Secretary of the Army Patterson will be here soon, he must wait to meet with him.</p>
<h3>Eight Hundred Loyal Corpses Discovered in Seven Star Crags; Died from Enemy Poisoning While Defending Guilin</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Guangzhou, 4th] More than 800 loyal corpses of the National Army were discovered inside the Seven Star Crags in Guilin. It was found that when the enemy captured Guilin in the year before last, the soldiers defending the city were imprisoned in the crags by the enemy and poisoned with gas. Due to the climate in the crags, the corpses did not decay or smell. The chest and arm badges and names were clearly identifiable. The Guilin authorities have now begun to bury the corpses and build a cemetery to commemorate the loyal souls.</p>
<h3>Chennault Will Open Aviation School in China</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 4th] The Department of the Army announced that former U.S. 14th Air Force Commander in China, Major General Chennault, is going to China with civilian assets. It is understood that Chennault will open an aviation training school in China for Chinese Air Force pilots. Other retired U.S. Army aviators will follow suit and participate.</p>
<h3>Jin-Zhongyang City Besieged for a Hundred Days; Heavy Losses on Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway</h3>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 5th] According to the Central News Agency, the Communist army has besieged Zhongyang City in western Shanxi for one hundred days as of January 3. As many as 50,000 residents in the city have been killed, and 200 kilometers of branch lines of the Tongpu Railway in Shanxi Province have been completely destroyed by the Communist army.</p>
<p>[United Press, Peiping, 5th] A spokesman for the Hebei Provincial Government yesterday presented a lengthy record of atrocities committed by the Communist army in North China to news reporters here. Wanton increase of taxes, confiscation of currency and food, forced recruitment of people, murder of National Army personnel, insults to women, and sale of opium are all examples of the Communist army's behavior.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 5th] The Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway has suffered heavy losses due to repeated destruction by the Communist army. In addition, Dongbao teachers Zhou Yinqin and Zhou Wangjin, etc., were killed by the Communist Party one after another because they were unwilling to be used by the Communist Party, involving more than 6,000 people. More than 30 students were buried alive by the Communist Party, and local intellectuals were all in fear and fled everywhere.</p>
<h3>Zhang Zhizhong Arrives in Lanzhou; Scheduled to Fly to Chongqing Today</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Lanzhou, 5th] Minister Zhang Zhizhong, after completing his new mission, arrived in Lanzhou from Xinjiang at 2:30 pm on the 5th, accompanied by Zhang Jingyu and Qu Wu. Max D. Aisa and others also returned to Lanzhou on the same plane. Minister Zhang said that the details of the resolution of the Yining incident must be announced after he reports to Chongqing. As for whether he himself will go to Xinjiang again, there is no decision at this moment. Zhang and his party are scheduled to leave the gate and fly to Chongqing at 10:00 am on the 6th.</p>
<h3>Petitions from the People of the Capital Are Being Sorted; Reports of Massacres Are Shocking</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 5th] Chairman Chiang inspected Nanjing and received a total of 1,036 petitions from the people. They are being sorted out day and night, and the preliminary work has been completed. The nature of the petitions is roughly the same as those received in Peiping. The most common requests are for pensions, relief, and job assignments, totaling 279 items. Those requesting pensions and relief are mostly family members of soldiers and civilians who were killed or injured in the War of Resistance against Japan and people who suffered from the atrocities of the enemy puppets, whose family property was destroyed, and who were poor and helpless. Those requesting job assignments are mostly soldiers and civil servants who participated in the War of Resistance against Japan. There are also those who have been detained for cases and request investigation and release, and those whose relatives and friends participated in the War of Resistance against Japan and disappeared and request investigation and search. The next most common are petitions reporting the crimes of the enemy puppets, totaling 231 items, of which 67 items are reports of the atrocities of the Japanese invaders in the Nanjing Massacre. The various cruel acts of enemy soldiers, such as rape, murder, and looting, are shocking. One can imagine the ferocious faces of the beast soldiers and the tragic cries of the people in those years. Most of the petitioners have experienced it personally, and there is a lot of very true and very valuable information, such as the records of the Jinling Women's College Refugee Camp on that day, which is worth paying attention to. In addition, there are 150 cases of accusing civil servants, military police, and receiving personnel of illegal acts and dereliction of duty. Some are suffering and appealing, and some are speaking out of justice and reporting. There are 138 cases of various civil disputes, mostly disputes over the sale and lease of property, requesting fair handling. There are 53 items providing suggestions on military, political, and economic construction, and many are worthy of reference. There are 20 petitions reporting the atrocities of the Communist Party, the most prominent of which are reports of the "New Fourth Army" looting materials in Jiangsu and Anhui, levying exorbitant taxes, killing young people, and destroying transportation. There are 120 other statements that do not belong to the above categories, mostly expressing sincere respect and gratitude for Chairman Chiang's leadership in the War of Resistance against Japan, defeating the violent enemy, and restoring peace, or reporting on years of work and service aspirations, and requesting a meeting to report secret matters. There are also 73 petitions without names and addresses. All petitions will be effectively processed in accordance with Chairman Chiang's instructions. Except for those without names and addresses, replies to the petitioners have begun to be sent. As for the petition letters in Peiping, in addition to those that need to be investigated in detail, they have been actively processed separately. It is reported that the replies to the petitioners have been mailed in batches by air since the 31st of last month, and 1,612 letters have been sent so far.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 5th] The new French Ambassador to China, Mery, flew to Chongqing from India at 3:30 pm on the 5th. His wife and daughter, as well as Luo, the first secretary of the French Embassy who had flown to India to meet him a few days ago, accompanied him.

<h3>Beining Railway Open and Unimpeded - Jinpu Line to be Quickly Repaired and Ready to Reach Dezhou</h3>
<p>[United Press, Peiping, 5th] Chinese newspapers report that the railway between Peiping and Shanhaiguan is now open and unimpeded.

<h3>Snippets from Guangzhou</h3>
<p>— Liang Feng</p>
<p>[Our Guangzhou Air Mail] I heard that Nanjing, Kunming, Hankou, and other places have already experienced showers, but Guangzhou is just like spring. Except for mornings and evenings when you need to wear an overcoat, a lined robe is enough at noon! People returning from Chongqing, Guiyang, and other places all feel that the weather in the South is really lovely.</p>
<p>It's the same Christmas, but the situation in Guangzhou and Hong Kong is very different. According to Hong Kong newspapers, "all cinemas and dance halls have tripled their profits, and major restaurants are packed with customers. The scene of elegantly dressed men and women rubbing shoulders is rare since the war..." As for here, apart from a group of God's children singing hymns in churches and a few prominent families holding private dances, there is not a single festive Christmas scene on the streets. It is likely that not many of our compatriots here are acquainted with Santa Claus!</p>
<p>The saying "Eating in Guangzhou" seems to have two interpretations: one is that Guangzhou is known for its many and exquisite types of food. The other interpretation is that Guangzhou people love to eat, which is not without reason. Recently, the Thrift Committee conducted a reliable survey and found that the total daily consumption of food and drink in tea houses and restaurants by members of society is more than 50 million yuan, or 150 billion yuan per month. 40% of this is attributed to the consumption of passing common people, and 60% is attributed to the unnecessary consumption of Guangzhou citizens. In this way, the unnecessary consumption of citizens on food and drink is more than 90 billion yuan per month, a truly staggering figure! No wonder the authorities are advocating thrift!</p>
<p>Social phenomena often have contradictions. On the one hand, there are such huge figures of consumption on food and drink, while on the other hand, there is no lack of people in need of relief. According to the local emergency relief society, from December 1st to December 26th, the society buried a total of 519 corpses, averaging more than 20 burials per day. It is said that the causes of death are mostly due to hardship and suffering during the war, malnutrition, and high prices after the victory, lack of relief, and no relatives after death, or relatives unable to afford funeral expenses. From this, we can also see the seriousness of the livelihood issues in Guangzhou.</p>
<p>The news that Central Goodwill Envoys Chen Jitang and Li Wenfan came to Guangdong has brought joy to the people of Baiyue. Like a group of suffering children who have just regained stability, they are excited to be comforted by a parent. However, it has caused trouble for the welcoming staff and reporters. On the morning of the 25th, it was said that the two special envoys would arrive at 11 o'clock, and everyone ran to the pier and waited until 2 o'clock without seeing anyone. At 8 o'clock in the afternoon, a message was received saying that they would arrive immediately, but it was still a false alarm. It turned out that the two special envoys had indeed arrived at the Provincial River that night, but due to martial law, they did not enter the city until early the next morning.</p>
<p>Since the beginning of winter, the theater scene here seems to be gradually booming. Following the performance of "Zhu Men Yuan" by the Political Corps of the Second Front Army, the Guangdong Drama Association's "Sorrowful City" and the Art Union's "La Traviata" are now being performed simultaneously.</p>
<p>A few days ago, a group of cultural figures came from Kunming, a border city: Zhang Min, Qu Baiyin, Zhou Gangming, Tian Nianyang, Han Beiping, Hou Minggao, Wang Yi, Xu Bingfeng, Hong Nai, and others. The comrades here extended their sincere and warm hands to welcome this group of cultural fighters, and a grand welcome party was held on a day of mild weather. At the meeting, everyone shouted a common slogan: "Build the nation on one hand, and build drama on the other!" (December 29th)</p>

<h3>After MacArthur Issued New Directive, Japanese Cabinet Falls into a Dilemma - Currently Compiling List of Dismissed Personnel - Number of Japanese Officials Involved May Reach 20,000</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] According to a radio broadcast from San Francisco at midnight on the 5th, after MacArthur ordered that former Japanese officials should not participate in current government work, two major figures will resign. One is Minister of Agriculture and Forestry Matsumura, and the other is Minister of Commerce and Industry Ogasawara. Both were members of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 5th] While the Japanese people were this morning focusing on the major Japanese political figures included in MacArthur's directive yesterday, all Japanese politicians were waiting with trepidation for the full impact of the order. According to unofficial estimates, the number of Japanese officials involved in the directive may reach 20,000. MacArthur's directive has almost led to the destruction of the Japanese political world, so the Japanese elections may be delayed for two months.</p>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 5th] MacArthur yesterday ordered the Japanese government to purge pro-aggression elements and begin compiling a list of officials to be dismissed. The Japanese political world was greatly shaken, and newspapers used large headlines to call it "Crisis in the Japanese Cabinet." Since the publication of the first list of war criminals, the repercussions caused by MacArthur's directive this time are the most widespread. The Japanese cabinet held an emergency meeting to discuss how to deal with the situation, appearing utterly at a loss. "Mainichi Shimbun" said that the cabinet has encountered the most serious crisis since taking office. Newspapers plan to list one by one those affected by this directive and those related to the Imperial Rule Assistance Association. Those listed include Privy Council President Suzuki, who served as president of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association during his term as prime minister, as well as six members of the House of Peers, Minister of Home Affairs Ishiwata, one member of the Privy Council, and three members of the House of Representatives. Foreign Minister Yoshida reportedly plans to immediately go to the GHQ to obtain a detailed report supplementing this directive and will submit it to the cabinet meeting this afternoon. The Japanese government has quickly begun compiling a list of dismissed personnel, which will be submitted to the GHQ before publication. According to Mainichi Shimbun, if this directive is strictly implemented, the only cabinet members not affected are Prime Minister Shidehara and Foreign Minister Yoshida. Prime Minister Shidehara has indicated that he intends to dismiss the cabinet members criticized by MacArthur and select talented individuals to cope with the situation. If so, whether the cabinet can be reorganized to overcome the difficulties will be a major issue. If the situation deteriorates, the cabinet may resign en masse. Yomiuri Shimbun said that Prime Minister Suzuki and his successor Prime Minister Higashikuni, who were in office when Japan surrendered, both participated in the Japanese Supreme Military Council and will inevitably be affected by this directive. Asahi Shimbun said that although this directive was expected, it is nothing less than a bucket of cold water poured on the Progressive Party. The Progressive Party is one of the most powerful political parties in Japan. Of its fifteen executives, only three can stay. An editorial in the newspaper on the previous day said that the United Nations policy has so far only sought to exclude those who led Japan astray, and now it has moved further towards building a new Japan. Although the people do not know what kind of leaders to elect, now that the evil ones are gone, they should strive to put forward suitable candidates to succeed them. The headquarters of the Socialist Party said that this directive will result in the destruction of the Progressive Party and the disintegration of the Liberal Party. The Socialist Party will benefit. Although some members of the party have joined the Imperial Rule Assistance Association, as a whole, it will be a major victory for the Socialist Party. This is an excellent opportunity to use to become a major party in the parliament.</p>
<p>Emergency Cabinet Meeting Postponed Until Today</p>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 5th] The emergency meeting of the Shidehara Cabinet, which was originally scheduled to be held today to discuss MacArthur's directive to purge militaristic elements from the Japanese political world, has now been postponed until tomorrow. According to Cabinet Secretary General Tsuda, the cabinet may remain in office after reorganization. Tsuda himself may not be able to retain his position. It is said that the postponement of the meeting is because the emergency ordinance drafting the conditions for the implementation of the directive was not completed today. The cabinet will now hold a meeting at 10 am tomorrow. Shidehara has not recovered from his cold and is still resting at home and may not be able to attend tomorrow's meeting. As for the reason for convening the cabinet meeting, the main topic is to discuss the imperial edict. Cabinet members will not make any formal decisions regarding the current government's attitude. However, the urgent questions of whether the cabinet will resign en masse, or whether all unqualified personnel will be dismissed before the remaining members continue to stay in office, will be thoroughly discussed. Foreign Minister Yoshida may not discuss MacArthur's directive from yesterday when reporting on national affairs this afternoon, nor will Yoshida go to the GHQ to discuss the implementation of the directive. According to the impression gained by Japanese newspaper reporters who have visited the prime minister's residence, Shidehara intends to continue to stay in office after dismissing three or five cabinet members. The number of cabinet members to be replaced will depend on how MacArthur's two recent directives are interpreted.</p>
<p>The Remnants of the Warlords Must Be Completely Cleared Away</p>
<p>[Special dispatch from this newspaper in Tokyo on the 5th] MacArthur yesterday ordered the Japanese government to remove all levels of personnel and organizations that brewed, launched, and led Japan to undermine world peace, with the aim of freeing all political parties and the government itself from the forces of warlords and brutality, and liberating government officials from the attacks and terror of secret terrorist societies. MacArthur instructed the Japanese government to abolish all extremist nationalist, terrorist, and warlord associations and groups, and other political associations and organizations must also be managed to prevent unlawful elements from controlling them. Government personnel who deceived and drove the Japanese people into the idea of conquering the world must be eliminated and not allowed to be employed as civil servants. According to this instruction, the Japanese government must replace and restrict all responsible persons who misled Japan.</p>
<p>Those excluded from executive positions include the following levels of people: (1) war criminals, (2) personnel of various military institutions, (3) all officers who have served in the military and naval police force, or other special or secret intelligence organizations, (4) managers and other key officials who have provided substantial economic and financial support to extremist nationalist, terrorist, and secret patriotic associations, or editors of publications of the same nature, or publishing institutions, members of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association, Political Rule Assistance Association, and other socially influential members, (5) chairmen, vice-chairmen, advisors, general accountants, and branch managers of banks, development, and industrial promotion companies established in various Japanese-occupied areas as a result of the war, (6) certain senior officials, such as governors-general, civil affairs chiefs, military chiefs, and their equivalent ranks in Korea, Taiwan, Guangdong, the South Seas, East Indies, Vietnam, Burma, and continents, all Japanese officials in Mongolia, the Philippines, India, Thailand who ruled the local cooperative puppet government, (7) and all other militarists and those who commit violence against those who oppose the militarist system.</p>
<h3>Japanese Archives - Preventing Destruction - List of Traitors Should Be Especially Noted</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Tokyo, 5th] MacArthur's headquarters ordered the Japanese government to return all records, files, and official documents from various departments to their original locations, because these documents may be destroyed. During the Sino-Japanese War and before, there were many traitors who were involved in secret agent organizations and active throughout China. We hope that our government authorities will consult with MacArthur's headquarters and instruct the Japanese government to provide a list of undiscovered traitors from these documents in order to cleanse the bloodline of our nation.</p>
<h3>MacArthur Rejects Japanese Fishing in Our Territorial Waters</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Tokyo, 5th] The Japanese business shipping community, through the Central Liaison Office, submitted a request to the naval shipping management authorities of MacArthur's headquarters, requesting that the currently approved three Japanese offshore fishing zones be expanded to the East China Sea and the Yellow Sea. It is reported that this request has been rejected by MacArthur's headquarters.</p>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 5th] Yomiuri Shimbun reported that from December 31st of last year to January 1st of this year, only 8,000 Japanese people visited the Ise Grand Shrine, compared with an average of 400,000 people in previous years. This is probably the result of MacArthur's recent instruction to the Japanese government to abolish Shintoism and various shrines.</p>
<h3>U.S. Secretary of the Army to Leave Japan for Chongqing Within Days - To Meet with Chairman Chiang</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] According to a radio broadcast from San Francisco at midnight on the 5th, U.S. Secretary of the Army Patterson has arrived in Tokyo and will fly to Chongqing within a few days to meet with Chairman Chiang and General Wedemeyer.</p>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 5th] This morning, U.S. Secretary of the Army Patterson received a briefing in a meeting room near MacArthur's office from the heads of various departments of the Allied Supreme Commander regarding the progress of the occupation work. Officials at Supreme Headquarters said that Patterson was "very familiar" with the situation in all aspects.</p>
<h3>France Attaches Conditions to Participation in the Far Eastern Commission - Demands Veto Power</h3>

<h3>UN General Assembly First Session - Only Five Days Until Opening - Delegates from Various Countries Depart for London - Proposals to the Assembly Have Been Cutoff As of Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 4th] The final preparations for the first session of the United Nations General Assembly, which is being held in Westminster Abbey, have been completed, and a new world organization to maintain world security and peace will be officially launched here. The opening ceremony of the General Assembly is scheduled for 4:00 pm on January 14th, to allow radio commentators to broadcast the opening to all corners of the world. According to the UN Secretariat, approximately 400 million journalists and radio commentators representing the United Nations have received press passes. The chairman of the UN Preparatory Commission, Columbia representative Dr. Ambe, will serve as the temporary chairman of the opening ceremony. British Prime Minister Attlee will deliver a welcoming speech on behalf of the host country. The opening ceremony is said to be very simple. In addition to the opening and welcoming speeches, the first day of the General Assembly will only be devoted to electing the President of the General Assembly. Some delegations have already arrived in London, and others are en route to the UK and will arrive within days. It is believed that this General Assembly is the largest gathering of politicians in world history. According to current information, two delegations will be led by the heads of government of their respective countries, namely the United Kingdom and New Zealand. In addition, the delegations of the United States, France, Denmark, the Netherlands, Turkey, Egypt, Greece, and Norway will be led by their foreign ministers. It has now been confirmed that Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov will not be able to attend the General Assembly and will be replaced by Deputy Chairman Vyshinsky to lead the delegation.

<p>[Reuters, London, 5th] The plenary session of the United Nations, with a total of fifty-one countries participating, is scheduled to hold its first meeting here on January 10 (next Thursday).

One hundred U.S. representatives, fifty-five representatives from South American countries, and delegations from Canada and Australia, as well as some Soviet representatives and the French Ambassador to the United States, have boarded the Queen Mary and are expected to arrive in Southampton this weekend. The British government will send a representative, perhaps Minister of State Packer, to welcome them. Representatives from China, Egypt, Iran, and India will travel to the UK on British Airways planes. The Soviet delegation has brought seven large planes to fly directly from Moscow to the conference. Motions to be submitted to the first meeting of the General Assembly must be submitted before today. It is understood that the British cabinet discussed the final form of the motion that the British government intends to submit to the General Assembly. As of yesterday, the governments of China, France, and Canada had not yet responded to the nuclear energy control plan agreed upon at the Moscow Conference. It is expected that this will be one of the most exciting debates when the General Assembly meets.</p>
<p>Important Agenda</p>
<p>Another important task of the General Assembly is the election of the President of the United Nations. Belgian Foreign Minister Spaak seems well suited for this position. As for the election of the Secretary-General, since the headquarters is located in the United States, it is generally hoped that a European will be appointed to balance the situation. Other important items on the agenda include the election of six non-permanent members of the Security Council. Canada, as the holder of atomic secrets, is expected to be elected as one of the members. In addition, the world's refugee problem has also been included on the agenda. The first meeting of the General Assembly is expected to last for a month. Before it concludes, it is hoped that some neutral countries will join the United Nations.</p>

<h3>Vigorous Competition Among Parties in Vietnamese General Election</h3>

<h3>Vietnamese Troops Resist French Forces - Scorched Earth Tactics Employed - Large Fires in the Suburbs of Saigon</h3>
<p>[United Press, Saigon, 4th Dispatch] As French troops advance, Annamese forces are employing a scorched earth policy. A large fire broke out tonight in the western suburbs of Saigon.

It is reported that a government warehouse storing 20,000 tons of rubber has been consumed by the fire. In the area 60 miles north of Saigon, where French forces have penetrated deepest, villages and rubber plantations have also been destroyed.</p>
<h3>Global Uranium Reserves Sufficient for 200 Years of Use</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 4th Dispatch] Professor Massey of the University of London stated in a speech today that global uranium reserves are sufficient to support the development of atomic energy for 200 years. Massey, one of the British scientists who researched atomic energy during the war, added that it may still take ten years to apply atomic energy to peacetime industry. The importance of this application is comparable to that of the atomic bomb, and its scope is beyond what can be foreseen at present.</p>
<h3>"Butcher of Fort Santiago" Ota Sentenced to Hang - Honma's Face Changed Upon Hearing the News</h3>
<p>[United Press, Manila, 5th Dispatch] Ota, the commander of the Japanese military police in Manila during the Japanese occupation of the Philippines, was convicted as a war criminal and sentenced to hang today. Ota, known as the "Butcher of Fort Santiago," tortured and beat prisoners during interrogations, resulting in numerous deaths. According to the military court that tried the case, Ota was fully aware of the actions of his subordinates and the nature of the Japanese army. He was guilty of not just one crime, but a series of crimes. Although he claimed to have been acting under orders, this cannot absolve him of guilt. The date of Ota's execution has not yet been determined, as it likely awaits the US Supreme Court's decision on Yamashita Tomoyuki's appeal, as the legal issues in the two cases are similar. Lieutenant General Honma, on trial in another court, turned pale upon hearing of Ota's death sentence. Honma's crimes of mistreating prisoners are no less than Ota's, and the evidence is conclusive, making it unlikely that he will escape punishment, so it is no wonder he was so disturbed by the news.</p>
<h3>US Grants Huge Loan to China for Purchase of American Cotton - Totaling $33 Million</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 4th Dispatch] According to authoritative sources, the Export-Import Bank of the United States has loaned $20 to $30 million to China for the purchase of American cotton. The Export-Import Bank was originally scheduled to announce the details of the loan today but decided to postpone the announcement until next week. The reason for the delay is unclear.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 4th Dispatch] A plan to supply China with 275,000 to 300,000 bales of American cotton is nearing completion. It is expected that the Export-Import Bank will soon announce a $33 million credit to finance China's purchase of cotton. Informed sources say that this cotton purchase agreement is similar in nature to the cotton loans already granted to European countries.</p>
<h3>Successful American Experiment with Machine Cotton Planting</h3>
<p>[United Press, Atlanta, 4th Dispatch] In this age of mechanization, machine cotton planting is now no longer just empty talk. Recently, in every state in the American cotton-growing belt, a cotton-picking machine has been tested, and the amount it picks in one hour would take a skilled worker a week of sixty hours to pick by hand. There are not many of these machines yet, and mass production is not yet possible, but cotton farmers everywhere are saying that mechanization is an inevitable trend.</p>
<p>Saving Labor</p>
<p>In North Carolina, a cotton company recently bought a cotton-picking machine and will rent it out to farmers during the harvest season for $1.25 per hundred pounds, whereas farmers currently pay $2.25 to $3 per hundred pounds for manual cotton picking. Not only can cotton picking be done by machine, but there are also weeders and trash burners, which are used to remove weeds. This work has always been done entirely by hand, with workers bending over, which is very strenuous. These types of machines have already been used on some cotton fields with considerable success, and their efficiency will undoubtedly increase. According to Agriculture Minister Anderson, as a result of agricultural mechanization, in five or ten years, perhaps only three million farmers will be enough. Therefore, in the southern United States, farmers must find work outside of farms. All authoritative opinions say that southern farmland will become larger and larger, the number will decrease, and the number of farmers and workers will also decrease, but the average income per person will increase greatly. Anderson also said, "The increase in agricultural output and the increase in variety will definitely require the manufacture and sale of more agricultural tools and machinery, more intermediate industries, more transportation, and more service industries."</p>
<p>Research and Improvement</p>
<p>However, the expansion of southern industry will not crowd out the markets of other places, because the food produced in the south is actually what the south itself needs. Anderson's words clearly point out that there is a close relationship between industry, agriculture, and commerce in this agricultural region, which is consistent with the opinions of other economic experts. In recent years, the southern cotton fields have been greatly reduced, but the yield has increased to 100 pounds per acre in the past ten years, and now they want to increase it further. The American Cotton Industry Extension Service is leading an improvement campaign, which has repeatedly convened meetings of researchers in the cotton-growing belt to develop procedures: first, urging farmers not to plant cotton arbitrarily, but to select the most suitable land and consider the land needed for other agricultural products; and also promoting the use of crop rotation and various labor-saving methods, selecting the best local seeds, using the most appropriate pest control methods, and collecting and ginning cotton to ensure the highest quality, so that high-quality goods can be sold in large quantities. In addition, cotton is also facing many new rivals, such as rayon, nylon, glass fiber, and paper. The production of rayon fiber in the United States is approximately equal to 1.7 million bales of cotton, and its price is cheaper than any high-quality yarn.</p>
<p>Wide Use</p>
<p>According to researchers' reports, another type of artificial fabric is also about to be successful. This fabric does not need to be spun and is made in one whole piece. On the one hand, cotton research is also being carried out to compete with artificial fabrics. The American Cotton Committee recently established a cotton research institute with a fund of $2 million, and there are reports of new uses for cotton almost every week. It is impossible to list all the uses of cotton at present, but it is estimated that during this war, there were as many as 11,000 types of cotton products used for military purposes alone. The latest invention is that when building low-value farmhouses, the exterior can be wrapped in a type of cotton cloth, and it can be used as an insulator indoors. In addition, a fire-resistant and non-corrosive cotton has also been successfully developed. The cotton industry has gone through many crises. In 1920, the price of cotton fell from 45 cents per pound to 12 cents, and it also suffered from a boll weevil infestation. During the most depressed period, the price of cotton fell to as low as 6 cents per pound.</p>
<p>Not Afraid of Strong Enemies</p>
<p>Cotton Committee Chairman Johnston said: The production price of cotton must be reduced, but there is no real threat to the cotton industry at present and in the future. Artificial material research has made significant achievements, but there is still nothing that can replace cotton in various uses and be completely satisfactory. It seems that relying on the power of science, one cannot find such an all-powerful thing that can compete with cotton. Recently, there has been a lot of talk about ramie, saying that it is the strongest fiber plant. In some areas of the United States, there are hundreds of acres of land planted with ramie. Some economists believe that this is no harm to the cotton industry, because although the death knell of the cotton industry has been tolled several times, cotton is still standing tall, so how can it be helped.</p>
<h3>Emperor William II's Crown Found - Authenticity Awaits Investigation</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 5th Dispatch] The German Control Commission announced that the crown of former Emperor William II and the snuffbox of former Prussian Frederick the Great have been discovered by British officials in a church near Minden, Germany, apparently hidden there by members of the Hohenzollern family during the war. After the concealment of these objects gave rise to some rumors, the authorities obtained the location of the hiding place from Oscar, the son of . Therefore, he was also present when they were discovered. Two boxes were found inside the church's staircase, one containing the crown and the other containing the snuffbox. According to Oscar, the crown belongs to the King of Prussia. After the Hohenzollern family became emperors, it was preserved by the family, and no other imperial crown was made thereafter. Whether this statement is true and whether the crown is a fake remains to be investigated. The snuffbox is a fine piece from the 18th century, made with enamel and gold, and is famous for its exquisite craftsmanship.</p>
<h3>British Government Actively Promotes - Strengthening Colonial Policy - Plan to Organize the Malayan Federation Not Yet Released - Caribbean Conference Invites Dutch and French Participation</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 5th Dispatch] In order to strengthen the British colonial system in preparation for establishing larger autonomous governments, former British High Commissioner to Palestine, Sir Alan Cunningham, will go to Malta to meet with leaders to discuss a new constitutional plan. The debate over the island's status has been going on for a long time. It was not until 1943 that the British government allowed the restoration of responsible government there after the war. Malta suffered heavy losses from repeated bombings during the war. Therefore, Cunningham will also report on Malta's need for financial assistance. Cunningham has just returned from Malaya, where he discussed the issue of merging the Straits Settlements and the nine Malayan states to form a federation. His report has not yet been published. Some say that this merger and the establishment of Malayan citizenship will be of great help to future economic development. Four colonies in West Africa - Sierra Leone, Gambia, Nigeria, and the Gold Coast - have established a common committee, the ultimate goal of which is also to merge into larger units to facilitate development. Although the plan to establish regional advisory councils in Kenya, Nyasaland, Tanganyika, and Uganda in Africa has been repeatedly proposed in the British Lower House, no resolution has yet been reached. Regarding the Western Hemisphere, the Anglo-American Caribbean Commission is scheduled to meet in Saint Thomas, in the Virgin Islands, on February 21, and Dutch and French representatives may also participate. The committee was jointly established by the British and American governments in 1942 to promote social and economic cooperation in the Caribbean region. It has since been expanded twice. The first time, unofficial representatives of the West Indies were allowed to attend, and this time, Dutch and French representatives are invited to participate again. The British Caribbean colonies have a total population of three million. The British goal is to establish a federation of the British West Indies, creating a fully autonomous government within the British Commonwealth.</p>
<h3>Extreme Heat in Southern Australia</h3>
<p>[United Press, Sydney, 5th Dispatch] New South Wales was hit by a heatwave today, with three deaths from heatstroke and twenty-nine people collapsing from the heat in Sydney. The highest temperature recorded was 111 degrees Fahrenheit in Bourke and 102 degrees in Sydney.</p>
<h3>American Political Circles Mostly Dissatisfied with British Stance on Siam</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 4th United Press Dispatch] British officials say that in view of Siam's declaration of war against Britain, the terms of the current British treaty with Siam are "generous." British officials admit that the demand for Siam to provide 1.5 million tons of rice as quickly as possible from its current large surplus may cause economic hardship in Siam. However, they claim that as a result of Siam's participation in the war, other countries in Southeast Asia have suffered even greater poverty and upheaval. It is understood that US officials are dissatisfied with Britain's position on this issue, for at least two reasons: First, the United States believes that the contribution of the Siamese underground workers to the common goals of the Allies is more than enough to compensate for the impact of Siam's reluctant participation in the Japanese war effort. Second, US officials believe that the British estimate of Siam's current surplus rice reserves of 1.5 million tons is twice the actual amount, and officials fear that this British demand will seriously damage Siam's economic situation.</p>
<h3>Iranian Parliamentarians Urge Prime Minister to Resign</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Tehran, 5th Dispatch] Iranian left-wing and right-wing lecturers recently held private meetings, deciding to inform Iranian Prime Minister Hakimi that they expect him to resign on Sunday "to clarify the situation in the country." It is widely believed that former Iranian Prime Ministers Ahmad Qavam and Manouchehr Eghbal are most likely to succeed as Prime Minister.</p>
<h3>The Motive Behind Hess's Flight to England to Explore Peace</h3>
<p>[United Press, Nuremberg, 4th Dispatch] According to secret Hitler documents recently discovered in the British-occupied zone of Germany, prominent figures in British circles wrote to Hess's representative, Haushofer, in May 1941 to explore peace, one month before Hess flew to England. Haushofer, as Hess's confidential advisor, informed Hitler in detail of his position in the peace negotiations after Hess flew to England, mentioning more than a dozen British dignitaries who he believed were in favor of a compromise with Germany.</p>
<h3>Arab Countries Demand Withdrawal of Foreign Troops</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Cairo, 5th Dispatch] Arab League Secretary-General Azzam Pasha stated last night that the Arab League demands the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Arab lands, including French North Africa. We must make people around the world realize that we will never recognize so-called military strategic points occupied by any foreign country within Arab territories.</p>
<h3>Vaccine Extracted from Fertilized Chicken Eggs Can Prevent Influenza</h3>
<p>[United Press, Ann Arbor, 4th Dispatch] The University of Michigan recently announced that a vaccine can be extracted from fertilized chicken eggs that is very effective in preventing influenza. This vaccine was invented by Dr. Thomas Francis Jr., head of the Department of Epidemiology at the University's School of Public Health, in collaboration with the Army Surgeon General's Office. Previously, the only way to deal with influenza was to take careful care of patients. This vaccine has been tested for two years and has proven its effectiveness. The ratio of army personnel who have been vaccinated to those who have not contracted influenza is one to four.</p>
<h3>Local Dispatches</h3>
<p>Songjiang: Bandits Rob Police Weapons and Rice Store</p>
<p>Around 9:00 PM on New Year's Eve, about fifty bandits suddenly arrived in Zhangyan Town, south of Shanghai. They spoke in mixed dialects and were equipped with machine guns, rifles, and pistols. After entering the town, they first robbed four rifles from the police station, then stormed into the Hengji Rice Store, stealing more than forty stones of white rice, fired warning shots, and left swaggeringly.</p>
<p>Jiaxing: Please Set Up More Counterfeit Money Exchange Points</p>
<p>After the banks in Jiaxing started exchanging counterfeit money from November 1st of last year, stores continued to use counterfeit money as usual. Although the circulation in the market has gradually decreased, the amount is quite large and the exchange procedures are troublesome, so the general public is unwilling to exchange it. Currently, the Business Association has announced to all businesses that they will switch to legal tender from New Year's Day to promote the public's rapid exchange of counterfeit money. However, because banks are closed for the New Year holiday, those holding counterfeit money cannot exchange it, and stores refuse to accept it, causing disputes from time to time. After discussions among the merchants, they agreed to refuse to use 500-yuan counterfeit bills uniformly, and to use the remaining bills sparingly. At the same time, they requested the Business Association to ask the banks to set up more exchange points to benefit the public.</p>
<p>Fenghua: Temporary Telegraph Bureau in Xikou</p>
<p>(New Tide News Agency) In order to strengthen the communication equipment in this town, the Ministry of Communications dispatched more than ten technical operators and other personnel from the Hangzhou Telecommunications Bureau on the 17th of this month, bringing wireless telecommunications equipment to set up a temporary telecommunications bureau. They also carried a letter from Xu Yi, receiving committee member of the Zheng County Telecommunications Bureau, to the Xikou Town Office, requesting assistance. The town office has temporarily lent a portion of the Wuxing School building to serve as the bureau's office location to actively carry out the work.</p>
<p>Taixian: Repel the Bandit Attack on Taixian</p>
<p>For the past ten days, bandits have gathered more than a dozen regiments, cutting off the Yangtai Highway in an attempt to occupy Yangtai and then cross the river to threaten Nanjing and Shanghai. Starting from the 20th of last month, about 30,000 bandits in more than ten regiments besieged Taixian. The garrison at Guo Cai, the most important stronghold on the periphery, was defended by Regiment Commander Wang Jianzhai, who fought a bloody battle for eight days and nights, charging more than a hundred times, and finally repelled the superior bandits. Taixian turned from danger to safety. Currently, they are searching for the remaining bandits and restoring traffic on the Yangtai Highway.</p>

<h3>Top Nazi Spy Enjoys Comfort in Concentration Camp, While Anti-Nazi Comrades Struggle in Hunger and Cold</h3>
<p>— Reported by the English-language *China Evening News* · Translated by this Newspaper's Translation Department</p>
<p>While the Nuremberg International Tribunal in Europe is conducting the grand trial of key Nazi criminals and their special agents, the "Gestapo," on this side of the world, in China, which occupies an important and vast strategic position, Hitler's cohorts are still enjoying a life of considerable freedom and comfort, and it seems they will not be punished for their past crimes. Mr. Newton, a correspondent for the Howard News Association in China, mentioned the above-mentioned ludicrous fact in the third of his communications on reporting the underground activities of Germans and Japanese in Shanghai after the victory.</p>
<p>In addition to the above-mentioned facts, thousands of Japanese remain freely active within Chinese territory. This is clearly the result of the US government's leniency toward German and Japanese activities in China. At the same time, the Chinese authorities are busy dealing with the disturbances of the Communist army, and the US military authorities have no power to arrest German and Japanese criminals (except those who have committed special crimes that directly harm Americans). All these facts have given the enemy elements of Germany and Japan a chance to breathe and enjoy themselves.</p>
<p>Key Nazi Criminals Arrested</p>
<p>Several weeks ago, the US military authorities urged the Chinese side to arrest 103 of the 319 well-known Nazi personnel stationed in Shanghai. As a result, only 50-odd criminals were apprehended, barely half of the list.</p>
<p>Among this group of arrested criminals, many, including the most active spies of Germany in the Far East in the past, may still find a "way out" and be freed from the concentration camp. Mrs. Aiva Tang, a Nazi radio host and correspondent for the Haitong News Agency in Shanghai, is also among those detained.</p>
<p>Prisoners Calling the Shots</p>
<p>Regarding the three major Nazi figures in the Far East, I intend to report to readers. The first, it is said, is currently "ill" and residing in the most upscale hospital in Shanghai. The second has been detained in a concentration camp, but he can still leave the camp to enjoy fine dining or sneak into a café to do business. Only the third person is actually confined within the camp. According to the importance of each criminal, the three major criminals are: (1) Pudkakatzen, the "number one" Nazi in China, who is the director of German intelligence; (2) Lieutenant Colonel Ohard, an Eisenslag, also known as Eisenbrechsel, who is the director of Hitler's military and commercial espionage agency in China, the "Ohard Affairs Bureau"; (3) Lachelmann, nominally the head of the German Railway Bureau, but in reality one of the leaders of Nazi activities in China.</p>
<p>Acting Like the Old Bosses</p>
<p>Logically, detained Nazi criminals should no longer employ servants, except for a few "coolies." However, the situation here seems to be an exception. They still hire "old servants" and "chief stewards," so even when confined within the concentration camp, they still appear here as "old bosses."</p>
<p>On the other hand, we must describe a tragic situation. Many "stateless" exiles, men and women who had long been expelled from the country by Hitler, or who had fled here to escape the clutches of Nazi secret police, are unable to find a place to live in Shanghai, which is currently filled with Nazi elements and Japanese soldiers and civilians. They can only suffer and use dilapidated tents as their "mansions," confined to a corner of Hongkou. In this area, Nazi party members once swaggered and showed off during the war, riding in fancy cars, wearing full military uniforms, and forcing refugees to "thoroughly cooperate" with them. Then their military authorities would issue "passes," which perhaps was what they called "free entry and exit."</p>
<p>What a Miserable Contrast</p>
<p>The Nazis live in three-story Western-style houses, which used to be a middle school during the Japanese occupation. The brick walls are freshly painted, the floors are smooth, and the windows are clean.</p>
<p>However, what are the circumstances in which the anti-Nazi refugees live? They live in the Xide Road refugee camp, where the so-called "rooms" are as dark as caves, without seeing the light of day, because there are no windows. Living there is simply like living like livestock. The room occupied by two Nazi party members is much larger than the one occupied by ten anti-Nazi refugees.</p>
<p>The contrast in terms of food is also disheartening enough to make one feel lost. This world is so cruel and ruthless, how can one not find it hard to believe? But this is the true situation, and one must believe it!</p>
<p>The Nazi party members have wine and meat, and bags of bread are stacked so high that they reach the ceiling. But the anti-Nazi exiles only rely on occasional shipments of flour from the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration for assistance. Beyond that, there is no talk of any food.</p>
<p>Number One Espionage Activities</p>
<p>In order to cover up Ohard's espionage activities, Hitler had him appear in China as a businessman, and then had him organize the Ohard Affairs Bureau. He had a semi-diplomatic mission and focused on completing three major goals. The first goal was to investigate Soviet purchases, the second was to investigate the situation in Japan, and the third was to report on the war situation and material conditions in the Far East. During this period, he went to Japan several times and engaged in activities there.</p>
<p>Shanghai-Guangdong Intelligence Network</p>
<p>This fierce-looking Ohard established three Nazi strongholds in China: (1) Beijing, (2) Shanghai, (3) Guangzhou. All three locations were equipped with radio stations, which, in addition to communicating directly with Berlin, also provided important intelligence to the country's submarine authorities. All intelligence supplied by each station to the submarines was received and transmitted by Shanghai, and then relayed to Berlin.</p>
<p>Foreign Refugees in Shanghai</p>
<p>The total number of "foreign refugees" currently in Shanghai is 39 million. Among them, 15,000 are of German, Austrian, or Czech nationality, 14,000 are Jewish, 600 are Protestant, and 400 are Muslim. Many of them have been classified by the authorities as "stateless" people. They are quite understanding of the fact that the Chinese government is troubled by the Communist army incident and has no time to take care of relief matters, so they are even more eager for another source of assistance. That strength is the strength that the American people can bestow.</p>
<h3>Japanese Residents Launch Clandestine Talk-Based Underground Movement, Four Factions Vie for Leadership, Authorities Should Strengthen Re-Education Work</h3>
<p>— By United Press Correspondent Yuan Lunren · Translated by this Newspaper's Translation Department</p>
<p>The re-education movement for Japanese in Shanghai, which began under the auspices of the Third Front Army, has been underway for nearly two months and is currently encountering serious underground resistance from the Japanese. The Japanese seem to have gradually become indifferent to the kindness of the Chinese authorities in treating them leniently at the beginning of their surrender. According to reports, a small number of Japanese people have been found in the Japanese concentration camp in the northern district of Shanghai who are adopting secret and strong resistance to the democratic ideas that the Chinese authorities have instilled in 90,000 Japanese people. This small group of Japanese people believe that their new position is entirely that of the conquered. Although their numbers are small, they have some influence.</p>
<p>Most Japanese people are not concerned about political disputes. One Japanese person said that they are busy seeking a livelihood. Many of them are worried about whether their money will be enough to support them until they are repatriated. Some are wondering whether they will be able to survive there after returning to their homeland.</p>
<p>Common Goal: Plotting Resistance to Re-Education</p>
<p>At the other extreme, there is also a small group of Japanese people who vehemently do not deny that they are communists. They openly advocate the abolition of the Emperor system and enthusiastically support General MacArthur's plan to control Japan. This group of Japanese people is really too small in number to influence the entire Japanese community. The Japanese in Shanghai have psychologically accepted the previous militarism and fascist doctrines. A well-informed source close to the authorities responsible for managing the Japanese concentration area divided the groups of Japanese underground resistance movements into four factions. These four factions are vying for leadership within the Japanese concentration area. On the surface, they pretend to obey the orders of the Chinese management authorities, but in fact they cannot thoroughly implement them. They have a common goal: to resist the Chinese re-education plan.</p>
<p>Different Factions: Each with Hidden Agendas</p>
<p>One of the factions is reportedly led by former Japanese diplomatic and consular personnel stationed in China. The leader of this "Foreign Ministry faction" is Tsuda, the former Japanese minister to the puppet Nanjing government.</p>
<p>Tsuda is currently still serving as the chairman of the Japanese Self-Government Association, which is appointed by the Chinese authorities. Qualified sources have compared him to one of the Japanese leaders before Japan's surrender and said that the Chinese authorities are considering relocating another person with a chiefdom-style personality to succeed him, but they have not yet found a figure who is as famous and prestigious as this old diplomat.</p>
<p>Although the Japanese army has been disarmed, it still maintains its influence in the Japanese national body. It will take a long time to change the psychology of the Japanese people who have been intimidated by the military for centuries. The leading figure of this "military faction" is Okamura Neiji, the former commander-in-chief of the Japanese Expeditionary Army in China. He is now the director of the Nanjing Liaison Office. It is said that his representative in Shanghai is Matsui, whose troops used to be stationed in Shanghai.</p>
<p>The Japanese Navy, which has always been jealous of the Army, leads the third faction. It is said that the host is a certain lieutenant general. This third faction does not have as much influence as the Army faction, because the Army faction also has plainclothes personnel from the former military police, who still occupy a great deal of power.</p>
<p>The fourth faction is the successor to the former Japanese Residents Group. The leader is Nakajima, who once served as the Consul General in Shanghai. Before the Pearl Harbor Incident, the Japanese Residents Group was a useful and powerful political weapon for the Japanese in this city. It always controlled the Japanese delegation in the former Public Concession Works Bureau, but this group was not sufficient to represent all the Japanese residents in Shanghai. It only represents large merchants.</p>
<p>Stormtroopers: Formerly Military Police</p>
<p>Chinese well-informed sources told United Press that the Japanese underground resistance movement has so far been limited to verbal activities. They are launching clandestine talk-based resistance movements against Chinese officials responsible for re-education work, and they are also generally smearing Japanese people who are assisting the Chinese re-education plan.</p>
<p>Several incidents of violent attacks on Japanese personnel who assisted or stood on the side of Chinese re-education personnel have been discovered. Two or three assistant editors of the Japanese newspaper "Democratic Japan," which is run by the Third Front Army, have been attacked by thugs.</p>
<p>An extremist nationalist party has established a stormtrooper organization called the "Shanghai Stormtroopers," many of whom are former military police officers.</p>
<p>Only Seventy-Odd Democrats</p>
<p>On the other hand, a small number of Japanese people are very accepting of the Chinese re-education movement, especially those in the intellectual class. There are more than seventy Japanese people who are very active members of the "Cultural People's Club." The leader here is Hoshino, who is the only Japanese person in Shanghai who openly advocates the immediate abolition of the Emperor system. Hoshino's brother is also among the war criminals, and is currently imprisoned in Sugamo Prison. He was the secretary general of Tojo's cabinet and is one of the black singles of war criminals finally announced by MacArthur. The name of Prince Nishimoto, the brother of Emperor Meiji, also appears on this list of war criminals.</p>
<p>A member of the Cultural People's Club told United Press that unless the Emperor system is abolished, true democracy will never be realized in Japan. He admitted that they only represent a small part of the Japanese people. He pointed out that in a recent vote held at the Tokyo Higher Industrial School, only 27 out of 3,000 students voted in favor of abolishing the Emperor system, 58 voted in favor of preserving the old dynasty, and twenty students favored reducing the royal inheritance to a minimum.</p>
<p>Many Japanese Residents Support MacArthur's Policies</p>
<p>This member of the Cultural People's Club said that many Japanese people in this city agree with the plan implemented by MacArthur in Japan. They believe that if the Japanese government thoroughly implements the orders of the Supreme Commander in both letter and spirit, the democratization of Japan will definitely succeed. Therefore, Japanese people with democratic ideas oppose the current Japanese government because it does not faithfully implement MacArthur's instructions.</p>
<p>When asked for his personal opinion on the treatment of Japanese civilians and prisoners by the Chinese, he said, "I was here during the war, and I remember how the Japanese treated the Chinese. The antagonism between the two was really too sharp!"</p>
<p>Many Japanese people feel that they should prepare for a more difficult life after returning to their homeland during the waiting period for their return. Many of them still do not know if they will have a place to live after returning home. He believes that the Japanese should know more about world events and broaden their horizons. He explained that the trend of Japanese people learning English is part of the re-education plan, so that they can read English announcements themselves and have direct contact with the US occupation forces stationed in Japan.</p>
<p>The "Jiangjian" Ship Being Salvaged in Badong Taizi Bay</p>
<h3>Largest Merchant Ship Connecting Taiwan and the Mainland, "Taipei Hao" to Begin Sailing</h3>
<p>— By This Newspaper's Special Correspondent Qian Pei</p>
<p>Today is the first New Year after Taiwan's recovery. In the morning, the sun rises early, the clear light shines, and the spring scenery is boundless. The reporter jumps up from the bed (actually not a bed, but a "tatami mat" laid on the floor), throwing off the fatigue, worries, disappointments, and sorrows of the past year. I feel an infinite hope and eager expectation for the future, and I also feel that new opportunities are emerging for a career, and the heart of loving the country arises spontaneously.</p>
<p>From a practical point of view, this place is really an isolated island in a remote corner, separated by vast oceans. However, on this day of the beginning of a new cycle and the renewal of all things, we are also celebrating deeply with our compatriots in the mainland, without distinction between inside and outside. Today's New Year's Day celebration program includes the National Ceremony at Zhongshan Hall (Public Hall) at 10:00 am, the naming ceremony of the giant ship Taipei Hao at Keelung Port at 2:00 pm, the parade of all Taipei citizens in the afternoon, and the grand performance of the symphony concert at the Public Hall in the evening. There are many eye-catching events, but these are just a few examples.</p>
<p>Giant Ship Taipei Hao Holds Naming Ceremony</p>
<p>The ship "Taipei Hao" was originally named "Daiya Maru" and was sunk in Keelung Port during the war. After Taiwan's recovery, the Chinese authorities ordered the Japanese Navy to take charge of the planning and salvage of sunken ships in Keelung and Kaohsiung ports, and the Taiwan Governor-General's Office's Transportation Department urged them to proceed. The salvage work of "Daiya Maru" was soon designed and carried out by the Keelung Port Bureau of the Transportation Department. The ship was salvaged in early November and entered the dock for repairs. The project was completed at the end of December. After leaving the dock, it was berthed at Keelung Port's No. 3 pier. The ship is 218 meters long, 18.2 meters wide, and 11.1 meters deep, with a total tonnage of approximately 7,000 tons. It has a turbine engine with 2,200 horsepower and a sailing speed of 10 nautical miles per hour. It is the largest ship among Chinese merchant ships. Today's naming ceremony was also held at the No. 3 pier of Keelung Port under the chairmanship of Administrative Governor Chen Yi, from 2:00 pm to 4:00 pm. The US military also sent representatives to participate, which was quite a grand occasion. In the future, this ship will join the Taiwan Airlines route and serve as the basic foundation for restoring communication and shipping between Taiwan and the mainland. It is said that it will soon be tested. On this day when domestic and foreign transportation is virtually cut off, the naming of this ship has given the people of the isolated island a lot of excitement, which is also the best good news for the New Year.</p>
<p>Enduring Humiliation for Fifty Years, Emerging Unstained from the Mud</p>
<p>Looking again at the grand parade held in Taipei City in the afternoon, I felt even more that the people of Taiwan are lovely. However, what I mean by lovely is not any grand and high-sounding term, nor is it because the people of Taiwan can cater to and respect their superiors like the people of Shanghai and use money to win their favor. Comparatively, the people of Taiwan are rigid and absolutely do not understand how to destroy themselves or corrupt their officials with sensual pleasures and extravagance. What I mean by lovely is that after fifty years of沦者, after suffering all kinds of欺凌 and oppression, and after so-called enslavement education, except for a very small number of 劵民, they were able to emerge unstained from the mud, without losing the personality of the Chinese people at all, and with the sincerity of enthusiastically joining the embrace of the motherland. During this large parade, the reporter saw through the window the enthusiasm of the boys and girls in elementary school holding national flags and singing happily. Everyone tried their best to shout, expanding their lungs and full of spirit. This released all the accumulated hatred of the past fifty years and the joy of today.</p>
<p>Furthermore, although the people of Taiwan have been subjected to civilian education under Japanese rule and oppression, their level is also higher than that of the mainland. This can be seen from the widespread sale of newspapers. After the Taiwan Shin Sheng Daily was taken over and reorganized from the Japanese Taiwan Shin Pao, although its sales fell sharply due to language issues, it still has 150,000 copies now, which is quite a surprising number. Furthermore, the symphony concert held at the Public Hall tonight also shows the high level of civic education in Taiwan. The entire symphony orchestra has more than 80 people, conducted by the director Cai Jixian. According to Cai, all these 80-odd people are Chinese youth music talents recruited from all over Taiwan after the recovery of this lost land. After several months of training and rehearsal, they have achieved remarkable results. Without the high general education level of the Taiwanese people, how could this be achieved?</p>
<p>New Psychological Construction Can Be Expected to Be Completed Quickly</p>
<p>With the foundation of this civilian education, and the people have absolutely not lost their noble national character, the future of psychological construction for the people of Taiwan is really very promising, and its rapid completion can be expected. Administrative Governor Chen Yan expressed his hope for psychological construction in his New Year's Eve broadcast speech, saying that he intends to enable teachers and students throughout Taiwan to speak Mandarin, understand Chinese, and know Chinese history within one year of the thirty-fifth year. I believe this is absolutely possible, because the Taiwanese people are quite sincere in learning Mandarin and have made significant and rapid progress. Of course, the restoration of transportation between the province and the outside world, so that teachers who can speak Mandarin and teach Chinese can come here to work more, is also an urgent task that cannot be delayed any longer.</p>
<p>Because of the weakness of the country's power, Taiwan has been separated from the motherland for half a century. Now, with the success of the eight-year war of resistance, the lost land has been regained, and nothing is missing. The fate of Taiwan and the country is so closely related. If we want to maintain the integrity of our territory, we must first seek to maintain Taiwan. Those in power naturally have their own grand plans and contributions. The reporter aims to communicate the voices of Taiwan and the mainland, introduce the customs and culture of the people to other provinces, and within the possible scope, strive to fulfill the responsibility of being the voice of the people of Taiwan, to promote the implementation of various policies and the promotion of construction with opinions.</p>
<h3>Six Severely Damaged Yangtze River Steamers Set a New Record: An Interlude in the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Ship Repair History</h3>
<p>— Xu Xueyu</p>
<p>Before the War of Resistance, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company had a total of sixteen ocean-going vessels and twelve Yangtze River steamers.</p>
<p>In the early stages of the War of Resistance, after these ships completed their military and civilian transport missions, some were damaged by bombings, some were lost to the enemy, and others were sunk at strategic fortresses, never to resurface. Ultimately, only six Yangtze River steamers remained, braving the perilous Three Gorges with its swift currents and numerous shoals, setting a record for navigation on the Sichuan River. After more than a year, they safely retreated into Sichuan, bearing the scars of enemy fire all over their bodies.</p>
<p>Wounded River Steamers Seek Medical Attention in Sichuan</p>
<p>Even after entering Sichuan, safety was not guaranteed. The "Jiangjian" was sunk by enemy aircraft in September of the 29th year of the Republic (1940) at Taizi Bay in Badong, and the "Jianghua" was bombed again in Wanxian in August of the 30th year of the Republic (1941). After the "Jiangjian" was sunk, it took two years of salvage work to barely reach Chongqing. The "Jianghua" was bombed and burned, and not only were all the wooden fittings destroyed, but the iron plates and angle irons were also warped and twisted out of shape. In addition, the "Jiang'an," "Jiangshun," "Jiangxin," and "Jianghan" also suffered from neglect due to being idle for years and initially lacking funds for repairs. As a result, the damage they sustained during the war not only went untreated but also became increasingly severe.</p>
<p>At that time, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company had already considered in advance that during the counter-offensive and post-war reconstruction period, there would be a great need for transportation in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River. As long as these dilapidated river steamers could be repaired, they would still be a major force in post-war transport. Therefore, the company decided to repair them.</p>
<p>Financial and Human Resources Both Become Problems</p>
<p>Repairing them was easier said than done because it required money first, people second, and materials third.</p>
<p>The money issue was resolved with the special subsidies granted by our wealthy government, but due to the gradual soaring of prices and wages, the contract price for a project often exceeded the budget by a large margin. Before the project was even halfway completed, the contractor had already suffered losses due to the low contract price. In mild cases, they would request a price increase, and in severe cases, they would abandon the project and flee. This situation not only affected the finances but also affected the progress of the project.</p>
<p>The main problem with personnel was the lack of skilled workers. Most of the skilled workers in the rear were evacuated from Shanghai and Hankou, and their numbers were limited. Meanwhile, the emerging industries in the rear increased year by year, so the demand for skilled workers increased year by year. Factories spared no expense to poach skilled workers, so the phenomenon of workers jumping factories was ubiquitous. Often, projects that were actively underway were suspended halfway due to the departure of workers. Only those who experienced it firsthand at the time could deeply understand this difficulty.</p>
<p>Pebble and Sand Beaches as Natural Docks</p>
<p>Regarding materials, they could be divided into equipment and materials. In terms of equipment, firstly, there were no dry docks or floating docks in the rear, but it was necessary to repair the hull and axles below the waterline. There was no other way but to use the most primitive method to force it. After surveying along the riverbank, a large pebble and sand beach was found on the Tangjiatuo riverbank, seven nautical miles from Chongqing. The ground was very flat and the soil was firm. So, when the water was high, the ship was sailed out and moored on that beach, and then when the water receded, it was left aground there. At the same time, wooden stakes were quickly used to support the bottom of the ship to keep it stable, and then the sand and stones under the bottom of the ship were manually removed and wooden squares were placed. In this way, our natural dock was created. However, the dry season on the Sichuan River lasted only three or four months, so it was necessary to take advantage of this dry season to quickly complete the work of knocking off rust, scraping and painting the bottom of the ship, and replacing axles and sleeve liners, in order to float the ship during the high water season in spring. Speaking of floating the ship, it was a dangerous and arduous task. When the water was about to rise, manpower had to be prepared and kept watch day and night. As soon as the water level was appropriate, the fastest means had to be used to float the ship in the shortest possible time, remove the stakes, and start the machinery. Otherwise, the current of the Sichuan River was rapid, and if the ship's hull floated, and the stakes were not completely removed, the stakes would obstruct the ship, and the ship would rub against the stakes, causing serious consequences. If the machinery could not be started in time, then the danger would be even greater due to the water rushing the ship and drifting.</p>
<p>Temporary Workshops: Making Do with What Was Available</p>
<p>Secondly, there were no large lifting machines or equipment in the rear. Sometimes, to move a ship that was three hundred feet long, fifty feet wide, and three or four thousand tons in weight, we had to rely entirely on manpower using capstans. This was a very simple device, and each capstan required more than fifty people to operate, and could only lift thirty tons. Therefore, at times, dozens of them had to be used at once.</p>
<p>Thirdly, Tangjiatuo was a remote village where there was no electricity or factories. Therefore, larger or more complex parts had to be dismantled and transported by ship to Chongqing for repair and fitting. However, separate spare parts could not be fully fitted in Chongqing. A temporary factory was built on the beach using bamboo walls and reed mats. The lathes were hand-cranked, and the drills were foot-operated. Comparing this crude and simple factory with the shipyards in Shanghai, one would naturally feel like a minnow seeing a whale.</p>
<p>Material Shortages Affect Projects</p>
<p>As for materials, the situation was as follows. We must not shy away from the fact that the lack of materials was a common and serious phenomenon in the blockaded rear. Sichuan was a province that produced wood, but supply could not meet demand. To repair ships, people had to be sent to the mountains to purchase timber and transport it themselves in order to have it available. Metals were a major material for ship repairs, but this item was in particularly short supply. Rivets and screws had to be made from scrap iron. The most helpless situation was with "packing," which was a necessary material for ship repairs, but it was the most difficult to buy. Often, the lack of materials affected the progress of the project, resulting in delayed construction, increased costs, and ultimately forcing the contractor to escape.</p>
<p>Ships repaired under these difficult conditions naturally could not meet ideal standards. The goals of ship repair were: first, to be able to sail; second, to be safe. Beyond that, we did not dare to have any extravagant hopes. Therefore, the repaired ships were not comfortable, let alone beautiful.</p>
<p>Ship Repair Goals Successfully Achieved</p>
<p>Now the war has been won. Reconstruction is beginning, and the ships repaired by the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company have all set sail from Chongqing and have safely arrived in Shanghai. They are still continuing to engage in reconstruction and transport work. The above two goals have finally been achieved. However, all the equipment for passenger comfort is not complete enough. The authorities believe that only through enthusiastic service and future new ships can they do their best to make up for the current shortcomings.</p>
<p>Weekly Forum</p>
<h3>An Analysis of Post-War People's Hearts</h3>
<p>— Chen Gaoyong</p>
<p>Recently, I have often seen articles in newspapers advising the government "not to lose the hearts of the people," and government authorities have repeatedly instructed receiving personnel to "pay attention to winning the hearts of the people during the reception work." However, people's hearts are different, each with their own face. Knowing a person's face but not their heart, even in personal interactions, trying to grasp the other person's psychology is already a difficult thing, let alone trying to grasp the psychology of a large crowd? Therefore, although I am not a person who specializes in the study of psychology, at a time when everyone is paying close attention to winning popular support, I would like to offer a simple analysis of the psychology of the Chinese people after the war.</p>
<p>The unprecedented eight-year long War of Resistance caused great stimulation to every Chinese person. Since the Lugou Bridge Incident occurred eight years ago, the nerves of the people throughout the country have gradually entered a state of extreme tension. Since then, the war has intensified, the war zones have expanded, and the stimulation suffered by the people has deepened. The people in the occupied areas were oppressed and ravaged by the enemy puppets, of course, seeking life but not death, while the people in the free areas, in addition to paying money and effort to support the War of Resistance, could not avoid being bombed, running, and fleeing from the hardship of displacement. In short, no matter where they were, the nerves of the Chinese people were in a state of unease. This life of nervous tension was certainly a painful life, but after eight years of long-term tension, this extraordinary life has unknowingly formed a habit. Once the War of Resistance was won, the environment changed, and everyone seemed to breathe a sigh of relief, and their nerves no longer had to be as tense as before, but the transition from tension to relaxation, from busyness to leisure, although initially felt comfortable, soon inevitably felt empty. Feeling empty naturally leads to new demands, and if the new demands cannot be concretely determined, or if they are determined but cannot be realized for a time, they will naturally express dissatisfaction with the current environment. This is the first point we should understand about people's hearts after the war.</p>
<p>The rise and fall of a country and nation, and the prosperity and harm of personal life, are closely related, which is well known to the people of all countries in the world. However, because education is not widespread in China, and people's knowledge is not developed, this most basic common sense of modern citizens, in the past, it can be said that most people were clueless. After eight years of the War of Resistance, the people in the occupied areas personally suffered hardships similar to or even worse than the loss of their country, and of course, they deeply realized the relationship between the country, the nation, and the individual. Even the people in the free areas, because they directly and indirectly engaged in eight years of long-term combat with the enemy, have also particularly strengthened the concept of the country and the nation. In short, during the long-term War of Resistance, the people throughout the country endured unbearable pain, living a life that was impossible to live. Everyone thought that once the War of Resistance was won, the country and the nation would immediately be revived, and personal life would be as beautiful and satisfactory, but the fact is not so simple and easy. The War of Resistance was difficult, and building the country still requires suffering. The personal life in the transitional period may not only not be beautiful and satisfactory, but even some places are the same as before or even worse than before, so it is inevitable to be disappointed and dissatisfied, and from dissatisfaction to resentment, but we must know that the country and the nation and the individual are closely related and their interests are consistent, and there is antagonism in the unity of relevance and consistency. Therefore, whether in the War of Resistance period or the nation-building period, when we pool our efforts to pay attention to the collective work of the country and the nation, personal life will inevitably be sacrificed to some extent. In the past, our people's contribution and sacrifice to the country and the nation during the War of Resistance were witnessed by the world, but the contribution and sacrifice of the Soviet people to their country during the construction of the Soviet Union and the completion of the two five-year plans should also be used as a historical lesson for us. However, these historical facts are by no means known to ordinary people, so it is only human nature that they are dissatisfied with the various situations after the war. This is the second point we should understand about people's hearts after the war.</p>
<p>Social order is easier to destroy than to build. If it is renewed through natural evolution and historical development, people do not feel it much. However, if external forces and crude means are used to mess up a naturally developing social order, and then restore the original state, it is like smashing a machine with violence and then repairing it, which is indeed a very difficult thing. If a family suffers war and is destroyed, and today it has to be re-arranged, or if a large family moves once, and it has to be arranged in an orderly manner, I am afraid it will take two or three weeks or a month or two. What about a country? In the occupied areas, the enemy puppets controlled the area for seven or eight years or even more than ten years, arbitrarily dividing the natural areas, recklessly overturning the organizational system, and doing their best to destroy education, culture, production, and construction, messing up a good Chinese society and making it completely unrecognizable. Under these circumstances, even if it is well organized, it cannot be restored to its original state in a short period of time. What's more, it cannot be said that the reception work in some places has not been able to be scientific and rationalized, and even a few people have used the reception to engage in private fraud, which is simply adding to the chaos. It can be said that it is inevitable that people will feel dissatisfied as a result. This is the third point we should understand about people's hearts after the war.</p>
<p>The victory of this War of Resistance made the Republic of China one of the four powers, which can be said to be an unprecedented great achievement in Chinese history. No one can deny that this great achievement was successfully led by Chairman Chiang, but it can be said that everyone who is a Chinese person is involved, except for the traitors who have lost their minds and the quasi-traitors who tend to be inflamed. Although the direct and indirect participation in the work is different, and the size of the achievements is different, everyone is the same in their determination to defeat the enemy and save the country from danger. Once the War of Resistance is won, the suffering has not completely gone away, but it seems to have gone away, and the gains have not yet been seen, but everyone thinks they will come soon. It is easy to share suffering, but difficult to share happiness, which has been the case since ancient times, and it is still the case today. Therefore, there are disputes over reception, disputes over reconstruction, disputes between parties, disputes between factions, disputes between agencies, and even disputes within the same agency, disputes over territory, disputes over power, and even disputes over a house, a car, or a desk. Of course, the people who get the fight have nothing to say, and the people who do not get the fight cannot help but feel resentment. In fact, both the people who get the fight and the people who do not get the fight still have the qualifications to fight. It is a pity that most of the pure and good people have contributed money and effort during the War of Resistance, and have been oppressed and ravaged by the enemy puppets, but when the victory comes, they can only watch a few people fight for this and that, and their spiritual and material losses over the past eight years have nowhere to ask, and they even have to continue to suffer losses in the midst of your fight. How can this make people's hearts calm? This is the fourth point we should understand about people's hearts after the war.</p>
<p>Traitors act as accomplices of tigers, selling out the nation and plundering the people. All Chinese people hate them deeply, and the loyal and faithful people hold the attitude that loyalty and treason cannot coexist. During the War of Resistance, everyone thought that once the war was won, these big and small traitors who had lost their minds would certainly not escape the judgment of the national law. However, three or four months after the victory, it is impossible to know the exact number of traitors who have been caught, but traitors are everywhere. Small traitors are still at large, and even those who have changed their identities and are still engaged in public service are everywhere. The major traitors who have not been arrested, and even those who are still posing as celebrities and important people, are not necessarily non-existent. On the other hand, the people who have been loyal and unyielding for eight years are still living their poor lives, and even those who were once claws of the enemy puppets are now bullying the victorious officials. What injustice in the world is greater than this? Of course, the Regulations on Punishing Traitors have been officially announced by the state, and the arrest and trial of traitors have also begun. The government is by no means ignoring this matter, but the people's resentment towards traitors over the past eight years always feels that the government's handling of the scum of the nation is not strict enough, fast enough, and common enough. This is the fifth point we should understand about people's hearts after the war.</p>
<p>Living apart from loved ones is a source of suffering for people. For eight years of war, families were displaced. Once victory was achieved, everyone thought they could be reunited with their families and enjoy the joys of family life again. Who knew that the suffering of inconvenient transportation in the past three or four months was still no different from the war period, such as the railways in North China being dismantled, and trains being destroyed. Inconvenient transportation was even worse than during the war. Therefore, fathers and sons who have not seen each other for eight years, and brothers, wives, and children who have been separated, can only "raise their heads to look at the bright moon, and bow their heads to think of their hometown," and "wish people a long life, and share the beautiful scenery for thousands of miles." This phenomenon is of course temporary, but in the hearts of those who have been displaced for many years, it is a great anxiety. This is the sixth point we should understand about people's hearts after the war.</p>
<p>Businessmen, no matter how they understand the country and the nation, their first purpose is always to make profits and get rich. During the War of Resistance, whether in the free area or the occupied area, it cannot be denied that there were many people who made a fortune and got rich by taking advantage of the national crisis. The ability of these people who made a fortune from the national crisis was speculation and hoarding. After the victory, speculators had no opportunity to speculate, and hoarders had no goods to hoard. Seeing their property dwindle day by day, and feeling that the future of national production was bleak and there was no way to start, they also had to express a kind of anxious psychology. We do not need to sympathize with these people who are diligent in making money for themselves, but if we can guide them to embark on the road of national production, it cannot be considered a force for the country's economic construction. This is the seventh point we should understand about people's hearts after the war.</p>
<p>The above are the more obvious points revealed by people's hearts after the war. Based on these seven points, we can come to a conclusion: The people throughout the country unanimously expressed their sincere admiration for Chairman Chiang's leadership in winning the glorious victory in the War of Resistance, while they believed that some of the work of some members of the government could not meet their expectations; they felt that the future of the country and the nation had a new life, while they felt that their current real life was still extremely difficult and poor. In short, they have endured enough long-term pain for eight years, and hope that there will be no unnecessary pain to torment them in the future. Whoever can understand the psychology of the people can win the support of the people!</p>
<p>The Ship on the Blocks—A New Dry Dock</p>

<p>Commercial News</p>
<h3>Gold and Banknote Market Steady, Chinese Stocks Reach New Highs, Public Debt and Foreign Stock Buying Enthusiasm</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market was quite stable, with both bulls and bears competing fiercely. Arbitrage sales and arbitrage purchases were also inconsistent, leading to endless contention. However, with the surge in securities, floating capital after profits flowed in steadily, resulting in a recovery of 10,000 [yuan] better than before. Throughout the day, morale was slightly more excited than in the previous few days. However, retail investors were immersed in securities, and although the gold market was driven up, it was somewhat inferior. Paper merchants and large households shorted a lot, so it is necessary to guard against a rebound. Gold ornaments at jewelry stores were listed at 85,000 [yuan], silver taels were still at 600 yuan, and silver dollars were also fixed at 440 [yuan]. The secret exchange rate was still loose, about 8 to 10 percent.</p>
<p>The U.S. dollar also fluctuated with the gold market, with limited trading. All parties were waiting for the opportunity, and large households were not very active. Factories slightly absorbed at low prices, which helped to support it. The morning opened at 1380 yuan, then slowly rose, and in the afternoon, it broke through the 1400 yuan mark, resulting in an increase of 15 yuan compared to the previous close. Old Hong Kong banknotes were affected by the increase in Shanghai banknotes in Hong Kong, and the supply was more enthusiastic. New Hong Kong banknotes were stable, resulting in a drop of 5 yuan for old Hong Kong banknotes and an increase of 1 yuan for new Hong Kong banknotes.</p>
<p>The buying side of public debt was still enthusiastic. The C bond opened at 815 yuan in the morning and then improved all the way, with demand exceeding supply. However, the process was mediocre and there were no special performances. The soaring of Chinese and foreign stocks boosted the buying sentiment in the debt market a lot, with the highest price reaching 900 yuan, resulting in an increase of 5 to 70 yuan compared to the previous close. The Chinese stock market continued to work hard. Paper companies, with the help of Jinli [bank], bought Yongsheng [textile company]. Securities companies had different comings and goings. Although some of them flowed to the gold market, the stock market was lively and soon some of them returned. The Securities Association had high hopes, so both popular and unpopular stocks were favored. In particular, Yongsheng Yarn dominated, leading the way forward, and the highest price was even over 1,000 yuan. As a result, compared to the previous close, Yongsheng Yarn rose by 80 yuan, Meiya by 85 yuan, and the "Three Small" popular stocks rose by about 10%. People in the industry said that because foreign stock Yishah rose to over 3,000, according to asset calculation, Yongsheng's machinery was new and it had already started production, and the current price was still cheaper. The paper and yarn companies worked hard to get Yongsheng, and the future trend would be good.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks echoed Chinese stocks and continued to rise. However, there were few sellers at high prices, and there was a lot of hovering after the rise. However, buyers rose one after another, and popular stocks such as Yishah, beer, and paper were the targets of searching. Yishah even closed at the buying price, and as a result, compared to the previous close, popular stocks rose by 20% and unpopular stocks rose by about 10%.</p>
<h3>Rice Market Stable, Yellow Beans and Raw Peanuts Continue to Be Popular</h3>
<p>Rice sales were still lax, and the source continued. Both northern and southern japonica rice fell slightly by 100 to 200 yuan. Indica rice was scarce and still firm, and glutinous rice also had few ups and downs. According to Mr. Yang of the Grain Administration Commissioner's Office, the amount of rice and grain transported into the city every day was about 20,000 shi at most and 10,000 shi at least, and the average was about 15,000 shi. It is estimated that the current rice storage in the city reaches about 300,000 shi.</p>
<p>The oil market was active due to the fluctuations in Hangzhou and Ningbo, and the price was active, rising by hundreds of yuan. Flour sales in Fujian were very smooth, and the market was still trending firmly. Yellow beans from Xinghua and Quanzhou moved slightly, and the market was also quite strong. Corn was similar, and raw peanuts were still in demand, rising by more than 1,000 yuan. Bean cake demand in Taiwan weakened and fell slightly by 100 yuan.</p>
<h3>The Grain Industry's Complex Composition Urgently Needs Unification</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] According to statistics from the Shanghai Grain Administration Special Commissioner's Office, by the end of last year, a total of 81 soybean and rice wholesale businesses in the city had registered with the office, along with 780 soybean and rice retail shops and 57 coarse grain wholesalers. In addition, there were some coarse grain merchants and rice merchants who had not registered but were already operating, accounting for 40% of the total. Therefore, there are actually about 1,500 soybean and rice retailers operating in the city. The Grain Administration Special Commissioner's Office has adopted a policy of encouraging grain merchants to freely purchase and operate, so the number of newly established grain stores and retail outlets is increasing rapidly, more than ten times the number during the enemy-puppet's control of food. However, due to the excessively complex composition of food and oil businesses, the organizations that have established trade associations include: (1) the soybean and rice industry; (2) the coarse grain and oil cake industry; (3) the rice store industry; (4) the coarse grain retail industry; (5) the noodle and bran collective; and (6) the rice milling industry. Although there are six industries, their nature is roughly the same, and one business often engages in other industries as well. Therefore, Chen Chaofu and others have submitted a request to the Grain Ministry's Special Commissioner's Office, asking for unified management to avoid disputes. It is reported that the Bureau of Social Affairs has ordered the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to review and respond to the request.</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Procures Tungsten Ore and Tea</h3>
<p>[Reuter's Dispatch from Chongqing, 5th] Since the establishment of the Foreign Trade Bureau of the Resources Committee, China has sold 1,800 tons of tungsten ore to the Soviet Union. It is also reported that the Soviet Union has ordered 200,000 cases of tea from China.</p>
<h3>Coal is in Season and Selling Well</h3>
<p>The coal market is bustling with activity, and user demand remains strong. Sellers are frequently quoting high prices, so the upward trend has slowed down slightly. The arrival of firewood from overseas has become crowded again, but the actual sales to small retailers in this area are still strong, and the market situation is stable.</p>
<p>Another report states that the main reason for the recent surge in the coal market is that the coal reserves for civilian use in Shanghai have been depleted, resulting in supply falling short of demand. Some financially strong businesses, recognizing this, have turned to Nanjing, Zhenjiang, and other places along the Beijing-Shanghai railway line before the holidays to purchase coal for storage. They are now selling it at high prices in the market. At the same time, some briquette factories are also purchasing white coal from the Hankou area of the Yangtze River.</p>
<h3>The Goods Tax Bureau Improves the Method of Tax Payment for Cotton Fabrics: Small Transactions of Ten Bolts or Less Will Be Issued Certificates by the Trade Association</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] The Machine Dyeing and Weaving Trade Association previously submitted a document to the Goods Tax Bureau requesting improvement of the regulations for tax payment certificates for scattered bolts of fabric. This has been approved. For small transactions of ten bolts or less and bolts sold within the city, the trade association will issue certificates for transportation and sale. However, the certificate must be submitted to the bureau along with the original tax bill (cotton yarn tax payment certificate) through the trade association for stamping, and the quantity transported must be noted on the back for verification.</p>
<h3>Raw Silk is Difficult to Trade</h3>
<p>For high-quality raw silk from factories, foreign firms have entrusted agencies to handle sales, so the volume of transactions is not weak. Prices have risen by about 100,000 yuan due to the slight improvement in the gold market. Ordinary extra lots and five-lot goods have risen by 20,000 to 30,000 yuan. Thousand-strand silk is stable, and transactions are generally average.</p>
<p>There is demand for rayon, and sales are active. People are confident, and the market is thriving.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong and Guangdong Merchants Scramble for 20-Count Double Horse Yarn</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market was relatively stable. Customers from Hong Kong and Guangdong continued to demand 20-count heavyweight Double Horse yarn. Spot prices started at 800,000 yuan and rose to a new high of 850,000 yuan, a unique increase of 50,000 yuan. The sales of other 20-count brands were minimal, and many firms were trying to sell them, but transactions were scarce. The buying and selling of fine yarn and double-strand yarn was also not as enthusiastic as in the previous few days, and prices were similar to the previous day, with the trend seemingly gradually entering a soft state.</p>
<h3>Dyeing and Weaving Factories Apply to De Fu Foreign Firm to Purchase Goods</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] After the De Fu Foreign Firm was taken over for liquidation by the Enemy and Puppet Industries Processing Bureau, it has recently decided to sell off its inventory. The part that the Ministry of Economic Affairs' Special Commissioner's Office has reserved for state-run factories has not yet been determined. It is said that the sales volume is strictly limited. The Dyeing and Weaving Trade Association has consulted with the responsible person of the firm several times and decided that each factory should first register with the firm. After the firm sends someone to investigate and prove that the factory urgently needs dyes for manufacturing, it can then fill out an application form to purchase. However, it is still unknown how much of this application can be allocated. It is only known that the application form is divided into two types: Type A is for factories that own cloth and urgently need dyes for processing; Type B is for factories that have accepted commissions from customers to dye on their behalf and urgently need dyes. Both types must be stamped and certified by the trade association before the firm will review them. The Dyeing and Weaving Trade Association has sent letters to its member factories to register and apply for purchase according to the regulations.</p>
<h3>White Tung Oil Exports are Active, but the Foreign Exchange Rate is Undetermined, and the Future Market is Uncertain</h3>
<p>Before the war, white tung oil was mainly for export, with the United States accounting for 70% to 80% of the sales. However, due to the outbreak of the international war, exports ceased, and transportation in the interior was severely hindered. Therefore, after currency inflation, the price increase was not as severe as other goods. Recently, with the end of the war and the gradual resumption of international trade, there have already been several batches of white tung oil exported. Recently, demand has increased, and purchase prices in various places have increased. It is reported that Hangzhou dealers are selling at 26,000 yuan, while local firms in Shanghai need to purchase at 28,000 to 29,000 yuan. However, there are very few that meet the grade. Selling to foreign firms requires 32,000 yuan. However, because the foreign exchange rate has not been announced, there is little certainty about the future market.</p>
<h3>Dyeing Factories Adjust New Prices</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] The Dyeing and Weaving Trade Association organized a meeting of dyeing group members, most of whom are also engaged in dyeing for customers, yesterday at the trade association. More than 20 companies attended, and they discussed business reforms and dyeing price adjustments. It was decided that the trade association would set a standard dyeing price for all to follow. It is reported that the price for 190 silk-mercerized Shilin is 14,000 yuan (per bolt), light-colored Shilin is 10,000 yuan, Patriotic Blue is 7,000 yuan, original color is 5,000 yuan, and gray is 4,000 yuan. Prices for naphthol, An'an Blue, and Haichang Blue have also been agreed upon and will be announced and implemented by the trade association starting tomorrow (Monday). Furthermore, the trade association believes that the colors of military uniforms dyed by member factories are not uniform, which not only damages the appearance of the national army but also affects the reputation of the trade association. It has been decided to submit a report to Special Commissioner Zhao of the Ministry of Military Affairs, requesting that the trade association be responsible for improving the products.</p>
<h3>Cigarettes Rise</h3>
<p>The cigarette market has been weak for many days, and with the slight recovery in the gold market, people's confidence has turned firm, buying activity has increased, and prices are rising slowly. Afternoon trading was flat, and apart from Yizhong products continuing to perform well, Chinese-made cigarettes were stable.</p>
<h3>Summary of Commercial News</h3>
<p>Sugar Market: Xinghua white, cotton white, and blue sugar prices are stable, but Taiwan rock sugar is out of stock, causing local rock sugar and Fujian rock sugar to be raised by 30% to 40%.</p>
<p>Dried and Fresh Goods: Sales remain strong, prices are rising steadily, and high-end goods are frequently being snapped up by customers, causing low-end goods to become popular and their value to increase invisibly.</p>
<p>Dyes: Customers are generally taking a wait-and-see approach, and the trend is stable with a slight improvement, but it is not easy to revive for the time being.</p>
<p>Cotton Cloth: Sichuan merchants are actively purchasing dyed goods again, and dyeing and weaving factories are vigorously purchasing white grey cloth. Holders of spot goods and factory warehouse receipts are reluctant to sell easily, and the market has a thriving trend.</p>
<p>Knitted Goods: Yesterday, due to the rising price of yarn, 32-count socks and Queen velvet shirts have all risen. Sweatshirt transactions have increased, and general observations suggest that it will be difficult to return to small sizes in the short term.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Commercial Groups Urge Exemption from Income Tax, Truly Support Industrial and Commercial Enterprises, and Complete the Great Task of National Construction in the Future</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] There are a total of about 200 trade associations in the city. Recently, due to the decline of all industries after the war and the incompleteness of accounting books, they fear that the government will misunderstand the actual situation and levy income tax on the false surplus caused by the consolidation of book capital amounts. Industrial and commercial enterprises will inevitably be unable to bear it. Previously, at a reception for Comfort Envoy, Supervisory Envoy, and Vice Minister Hong of the Ministry of Social Affairs, Pan Shihao, the representative of the Dyeing and Weaving Trade Association and the Cotton Cloth Trade Association, spoke, requesting the government to exempt income tax for the 34th year. Jin Runxiang, Luo Qinghua, and others supported this view, and the entire audience unanimously agreed. After the meeting, an official document was formally prepared, and the trade associations jointly petitioned the Executive Yuan. The main points are summarized as follows:</p>
<p>It is Unreasonable to Tax a Fictitious Account</p>
<p>In the case of the conversion of puppet currency capital by industrial and commercial enterprises in the city, the trade associations, under the careful consultation of the Industrial and Commercial Law Regulations Committee of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, have studied the actual situation in detail, solicited expert opinions, and discussed the conversion standards. They all believe that there are reasonable accounting standards to follow for the conversion of puppet currency capital into legal currency. However, if the resulting false surplus is taxed according to the Income Tax and Profit Tax Law, it would not only be unreasonable in accounting but also impossible to implement in the tax procedure.</p>
<p>Commercial Enterprises After the Calamity Cannot Afford the Burden</p>
<p>Moreover, industrial and commercial enterprises have been devastated by the long-term oppression of the enemy and puppets for eight years. They are already in a state of decline, and the burden cannot be increased. The merchants have no profitability to speak of. According to the principles of taxation, the emphasis is on fair burden. Direct taxes such as income tax are indeed reasonable and good taxes. In modern advanced countries, they all use this as a key component of national tax revenue. When China promulgated the Provisional Regulations on Income Tax in the 25th year, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the trade associations took the lead in supporting it and convened tax regulations research meetings, held accounting technology lectures, and started training classes to assist in the implementation. Their achievements can be used as a model for the whole country and can be reviewed. After the War of Resistance, all industries in the city have suffered devastation, production has decreased, materials have decreased, and markets have been cut off. Although there is an appearance of wealth on paper due to the low value of puppet currency, in reality, the raw materials and goods of industrial and commercial enterprises cannot maintain their pre-war status. There are obvious profits but hidden losses, which is the case for all industries. Their vitality has been exhausted, and recovery is difficult. If the government insists on taxing this false surplus, factories will inevitably sell their production tools, and stores will sell off their remaining goods. This would be like draining the pond to catch all the fish. Not only would it be impossible to cultivate tax sources, but it would also make it impossible for industrial and commercial enterprises in the city to maintain themselves. As a result, even if industries want to go bankrupt and pay taxes, they may not find a buyer. The government would have no choice but to confiscate the factories' assets and commodities, nationalize them, and collect taxes, which is not what the government wants.</p>
<p>Excessive Profit Tax Should be Suspended</p>
<p>Furthermore, income tax and profit tax, when levied on profit-making enterprises, must be based on the actual net profit earned in business as the purpose of taxation. The true meaning of fair burden, which is promoted by modern direct tax laws, lies in this. Now that the enemy has surrendered and the war has ended, the excessive profit tax, which was promulgated during the extraordinary period of the war, should be suspended according to the law. There is no doubt that the income tax of profit-making enterprises should be calculated and levied according to the actual net profit of the profit-making enterprises. Therefore, the false surplus generated by the expansion of puppet currency in industrial and commercial enterprises in the recovered areas cannot be regarded as the purpose of taxation, and the reason is even more obvious.</p>
<p>Profit Income Should be Exempted from Tax</p>
<p>Moreover, after being exploited by the enemy and puppets, industrial and commercial enterprises in Shanghai have incomplete business facilities, inventory storage, and accounting records in order to avoid detection by the enemy and puppets when providing manpower, materials, and funds to the rear area and when responding to government bonds and donations. If the tax authorities insist on levying taxes when reorganizing and revitalizing, how will they calculate it? It is inevitable to cause harsh demands by making arbitrary estimates of things that cannot be calculated, which would disappoint and undermine the people's expectations and faith in the government. Based on the above reasons, the trade associations unanimously urge the government to provide genuine support to industrial and commercial enterprises in the recovered areas in order to achieve economic recovery and develop the great cause of national construction in the future. They respectfully request that the government, for the income tax of profit-making enterprises in the 34th year, refer to the precedent of exempting land tax in the recovered areas and issue an order to exempt it, so as to benefit industry and commerce and cultivate tax sources.</p>

<h3>Mr. Wang Fengjie Reports to the Central Government on Hunan Province's Education Recovery Plan and Describes the Losses of Educational Institutions During the War</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Changsha from This Newspaper] Mr. Wang Fengjie, Director of the Hunan Education Department, recently reported to the Central Government on the wartime losses of educational institutions in Hunan Province and the education recovery plan for the future. The general idea is as follows: From March of the 27th year, enemy planes indiscriminately bombed cities of all sizes in Hunan Province, deliberately destroying educational institutions, resulting in extremely heavy losses. In May of the 27th year, the enemy launched a large-scale southward offensive from northern Hunan, and the major cities of Changsha and Hengyang were successively lost. Seventy to eighty percent of the counties and cities along the Yuehan and Xianggui Roads and the periphery of Changsha and Hengyang fell into enemy hands. Until the Xiangxi Campaign in April of the 34th year, even the remote counties of western Hunan were harassed by the enemy.</p>
<p>Wartime Losses</p>
<p>In terms of the educational institutions in the province alone, the losses are as follows: The total value of provincial educational institutions and provincial schools at all levels is approximately 21.62435 billion yuan. The total value of county, city, township, and bao schools is approximately 17.33372 billion yuan. The total value of county and city education funds, such as land rent and real estate, is approximately 3.22992 billion yuan. The total value of county and city social education institutions is 1.67108 billion yuan. The total value of county-level and privately-funded middle schools is 4.056942 billion yuan. The total value of county and city primary schools is approximately 6.20928 million yuan. The total loss is approximately 89.72057 billion yuan. As for the future education recovery plan for Hunan, it consists of three parts:</p>
<p>Higher Education Recovery</p>
<p>(1) In terms of higher education, the provincial agricultural, industrial, and commercial vocational schools will be restored and strengthened. Before the war, these three schools were located in Nanyue. In the future, based on geographical environment and needs, it is planned to combine the commercial school with the provincial vocational school No. 2 and relocate it to Hengyang. The industrial school will be combined with the provincial vocational school No. 1 and relocated to Changsha. The agricultural school will be combined with the provincial vocational school No. 4 and relocated to __ County. The Ministry of Education also plans to expand the National Xiangtan University and add agricultural and commercial colleges. The National Normal College in Lantian will be relocated to Nanyue or Hengyang.</p>
<p>Secondary Education Recovery</p>
<p>(2) In terms of secondary education, before the war, there were a total of 38 provincial secondary schools (including normal schools and vocational schools). Those that were suspended, merged, or relocated due to the war will be restored within the 35th year. Before the war, there were a total of 98 county-level and joint secondary schools, which will be supervised by the county and city governments to restore them all within the 35th year. Before the war, there were a total of 181 private secondary schools. In order to promote the popularization of secondary education, private secondary schools should not be concentrated in cities. Those that were temporarily established or suspended during the war must be established or prepared for restoration this year.</p>
<p>Primary Education Recovery</p>
<p>(3) In terms of primary schools, before the war, there were a total of 34,604 schools. 8,350 schools were damaged during the war. In the future, it is necessary to restore the public and private primary schools and township and bao schools in the disaster-stricken areas. At the same time, the public and private education funds should be cleared, so that all schools can be restored to their former appearance by the end of this year. Hunan's primary and secondary education was particularly developed before the war, so the enemy's disaster losses were also very large. Large amounts of money are needed for recovery in the future, and it is hoped that the central government can provide subsidies. Relocating schools and building school buildings require large amounts of money. (Person)</p>
<h3>The National Education Recovery Conference Decided to Form a European and American Education Visiting Group to Elaborate on the Reasons and Methods and Request the Ministry of Education to Handle It at Its Discretion</h3>
<p>[Report from the Great China News Agency in Chongqing] The Ministry of Education's National Education Recovery Conference decided to form a European and American Education Visiting Group, elaborate on the reasons and methods, and submit them to the Ministry of Education for consideration. The following is the record:</p>
<p>Reasons</p>
<p>During the Allied operations, the educational policies and facilities of the United Kingdom and the United States were very well adapted to the wartime environment. For example, many universities in the United Kingdom and the United States were able to assist the government by adding various military training classes and providing a large number of talents for government requisition. The research, invention, and application of the atomic bomb were also successful due to the efforts of scholars in both countries. Therefore, in order to understand the true situation of education in the United Kingdom and the United States during the war, it seems necessary for us to organize a visiting group to investigate. This is one reason. The United Kingdom and the United States have made thorough preparations for post-war education plans and policies, and there must be many that can be used for our country's reference. Moreover, their educational facilities will inevitably directly or indirectly affect the world's political parties. Therefore, in order to learn from our country's recovery and understand the future trends of world education, it is also necessary for us to organize a visiting group to investigate. This is two reasons. After eight years of arduous war, the rear area and the occupied area, under the guidance of the central government, have fought hard and made great contributions. The resolutions and policies of this National Education Recovery Conference will inevitably represent the spirit and policies of our country's resistance and national construction. Therefore, it is also necessary to use this visiting group to promote our spirit of resistance and construction overseas. This is three reasons. Most of the universities and higher education institutions in the democratic countries of the United Kingdom and the United States are privately or church-founded, or although they are subsidized by the government, their administration and decision-making are independent. There will be many British and American cultural and educational undertakings that can cooperate with us after the war. Therefore, it is an essential step for the government and public and private universities to jointly send people to work hard to carry out liaison work at this time.</p>
<p>Methods</p>
<p>(1) Eight to ten people should be selected by the National Education Recovery Conference to form a "Chinese Education Visiting Group" to visit and investigate British and American educational and cultural figures and groups. The Ministry of Education will send two people, and the conference will select two representatives from national universities, two representatives from private universities, and four people jointly recommended by educational groups to form the group. (2) The representatives should be those who have academic status and are reputable in the United Kingdom and the United States.</p>
<h3>Yichang and Other Regions Plan to Establish Industrial and Commercial Vocational Schools</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Hankou from This Newspaper] In order to adapt to the economic and production conditions of various regions, the Hubei Education Department is planning to establish various industrial and commercial vocational schools in appropriate regions. It has been decided to establish an Electrical Engineering Vocational School in Yichang, a Mining and Metallurgical Vocational School in Daye and Hanyang, a Commercial Vocational School in Hankou and Shashi, a Papermaking and Printing Vocational School in Chenjiaji, and an Aquaculture Vocational School in Mianyang. Yichang is the area where the world's large-scale hydroelectric project is being designed, Hanyang and Daye are well-known coal and iron production and manufacturing areas in the past, Mianyang is the area with the most rivers and lakes in the country, and Shashi and Hankou are commercial centers. The establishment of these schools is based on these situations. (Important)</p>
<h3>The Shanghai District Qualification Review Committee Requests Changes to the Qualification Review Methods: Students from Puppet Schools Can Directly Enter Remedial Classes</h3>
<p>[Report from This City] Since receiving the Ministry of Education's qualification review methods, the Ministry of Education's Shanghai District Qualification Review Committee has now referred to the actual situation in this city and intends to make slight changes to the qualification review methods. In particular, students who have not graduated will be allowed to enter remedial classes without qualification review, and the issue of how to reward professors who were loyal and steadfast in their positions during the enemy and puppet occupation has also been submitted to the Ministry of Education for suggestions. After the reply telegram arrives in Shanghai, the qualification review work will be implemented step by step.</p>
<h3>Basketball Charity Match Opens: Shantou Team Loses to the US Air Force, Hualian Defeats the Signal Team; Two More Matches Will Be Held Tonight Starting at 7:00 PM</h3>
<p>The basketball charity match organized by the City Sports Association opened last night at 7:00 PM at the City Sports Hall on Albert Road. Fans were crowded to enjoy the wonderful skills of the Chinese and American teams. As a result of the competition, Hualian defeated the US Army Signal Team with a score of 41 to 32. The Shantou team lost to the US Air Force Jiangwan Team with a score of 51 to 46. Two more matches will be held tonight starting at 7:00 PM at the same location.</p>
<p>In the first match, the Shantou team played against the US Air Force Jiangwan Team. After the start of the match, the situation became a seesaw battle. Both sides made accurate shots, and Lin Weicong and Smadar were the keys to scoring for both teams. The Shantou team took the lead at 11 to 7 and 13 to 9 in extreme tension. At the end of the first half, the score was 18 to 18, and the victory was not yet determined. The situation remained the same in the second half. The Shantou team failed to surpass and remained closely behind. As a result, the US Air Force Jiangwan Team won with a score of 51 to 46.</p>
<p>The next match was between Hualian and the US Signal Team. Wu Shaoshu performed the opening ceremony. Kraton made the first basket, and Hualian chased hard. Chen Xuechong's shots seemed to be divinely assisted, so he was able to lead step by step. Hualian took the lead with a score of 20 to 15 in the first half.</p>
<p>During the break, a long strip of white cloth reported the total income, which was 257,500 yuan. Then, the charity ball was auctioned off, starting at 50,000, and the crowd competed for it. Finally, Hou Xueshi, the representative of Xu Guanqun, won it for 150,000 yuan. Continuing the battle, although Hualian made major personnel adjustments, the situation still took precedence. The US Signal Team tried to save the game, but their skills were not as good. Helpless, Hualian finally won with a score of 41 to 32.</p>
<p>More Matches Tonight</p>
<p>The charity match will continue with two matches starting at 7:00 PM this afternoon. The proceeds will be used for education loans. The authorities have specially invited Director Gu of the Education Bureau to preside over the opening ceremony. Tickets are still divided into two types: 300 yuan and 500 yuan. The order is as follows:</p>
<p>South China - US Signal Team at 7:00 PM</p>
<p>Hualian - Jiangwan Team at 8:00 PM</p>
<h3>East China Team Wins Decisively: 6-2 Victory Over Soviet Union, Today Qingbai Plays Against Jewish Team</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, at the Jiaozhou Park soccer field, fans flocked in. The East China team made its debut in the soccer league and won decisively. The match resulted in a 6-2 victory over the Soviet Union, with the score at 3-1 for each half.</p>
<p>At the start of the match, the Soviet Union launched a relentless attack, and East China couldn't find a way to score. It wasn't until the 20th minute that Jia Youliang took a powerful shot. Esipu received the ball but lost it, and Han Longhai followed up with a swift kick, finding the back of the net and opening the scoring. Soon after, the Soviet Union's Olov managed to score, leveling the score. East China launched a major offensive, and Han Longhai relied on his relentless rushes to score again. Song Lingsheng then fired a long-range shot from beyond the 20-yard mark, resulting in a score of 3-1 by halftime. Shortly after the start of the second half, Li Ning committed a foul, resulting in a penalty kick. Mai Qidang converted it successfully, making the score 3-2. East China stepped up their efforts again, and Longhai showcased his power, dribbling the ball into a seemingly undefended area and scoring with a high ball, making it 4-2. Then, thanks to Li Yao's brilliant pass, he scored again with a header, making it 5-2. Finally, Sun Jinshun displayed his strong leg skills with a powerful shot, sealing the victory. Soon after, the whistle blew, and East China won decisively with a score of 6-2.</p>

<p>Today's league matches include one Group B match, three Group B matches, and four Group C matches, still to be played at Jiaozhou Park and Hongkou Park. There was originally one Group A match, but the Italian Overseas Chinese team has withdrawn, so there will be no matches in the morning. At 2:30 PM, Qingbai will play against the Jewish team at Jiaozhou Park. Qingbai's invited players from Chongqing and Hong Kong have not yet arrived in Shanghai, so their strength may not be at the ideal level.

<h3>Pay Attention to Elementary Education in the Nine Northeastern Provinces</h3>
<p>— Zhanghua</p>
<p>The situation in the Nine Northeastern Provinces can now be described as clear: the Communist army has reportedly been ordered to withdraw, and the Sino-Soviet negotiations have been quite successful. Changchun and Shenyang have been taken over, and a branch of the Central Bank has already opened in Changchun. The National Army's airlift to the Northeast has also begun. This series of events has filled the Nine Northeastern Provinces with joy. Indeed, it is not limited to the Nine Northeastern Provinces alone; people across the country are feeling happy and excited about the clearing of the clouds. However, I personally have a lingering worry. Some may laugh, but my concern is that in the midst of this busy takeover, we might forget to take over a group of people: the children of the entire Nine Northeastern Provinces.</p>
<p>I remember that in the early days of the Anti-Japanese War, there was a popular patriotic song called "Return to Our Old Home". It powerfully cried out: "The Northeast is ours!" For fourteen years, we have not forgotten this statement. Now, I want to shout: "The people of the Nine Northeastern Provinces are ours!" Naturally, children are included. Perhaps this isn't really a problem, but if we just consider the spiritual shackles that the enemy imposed on our compatriots in the Northeast for fourteen years, it is enough to alarm us. The reason I specifically mention the children of the Nine Northeastern Provinces is twofold: first, the Nine Northeastern Provinces were occupied for the longest time and were most deeply poisoned, and second, children have the greatest plasticity and can be molded as desired. A few days ago, Dagongbao published Ge Yandi's "Dialogue with Takako Yamagishi", in which she mentioned that she runs a kindergarten and also primary and secondary schools in Pudong. I am really worried about what they are teaching. Regarding this, all compatriots who care about China's fate would not trust her, would they?</p>
<p>What is the reality? Let me transcribe a passage. This incident occurred at a Japanese commercial school in Hongkou after it was taken over and renamed Shanghai Municipal Schotter Road Primary School. During the busy enrollment period, a teacher saw us enter and couldn't help but say with emotion: "Look! This is the result of enslaved education. This afternoon, more than a dozen children have come to enroll. When they are asked to fill out the application form and write their age, they always write the character '才' (talent) instead of '歲' (years). In total, we received twenty application forms, and only one person managed to write the character '歲' correctly." Moreover, this is not only the case in Hongkou but also in the former concessions, not only in primary schools but also in middle schools and universities. The enemy occupied Shanghai for only four years, while the Nine Northeastern Provinces were occupied for a full fourteen years. We don't need to talk about the danger of cultural destruction, nor do we need to count the historical relationship between cultural education and national rise and fall. But in this great era, as the whole country moves forward in unison and the whole world moves towards a new path, we can't help but think about the evil consequences that enslaved education may produce. If the war had been extended for another ten years, our compatriots who had been deceived by the enemy might have become the culprits of the war, one day pointing their weapons at the motherland. This is not an exaggeration. Now that we have fortunately won, how to make our compatriots devout believers in peace and protectors of peace is something we should deeply consider and strive for, especially for children.</p>
<p>No sowing, no harvest. Without the seedlings of the nation, when the old and strong die, the country will be finished. If we have seedlings but they are all poisonous "poppies", then a dark age can certainly be predicted in the future. If we don't purify the poison in these seedlings, I tell you, darkness lies ahead. In fact, this is not just the responsibility of the schools. In addition to the teachers, every child's elder should tell them stories about the country and the fertile soil of the motherland. In conclusion, I shout: "Primary school teachers, go to the Nine Northeastern Provinces!"</p>

<h3>Songhu Garrison Headquarters Uncovers Japanese Secret Organization, Plotting Large-Scale Riots</h3>
<p>[Special Report] On the 11th of last month, the Songhu Garrison Headquarters uncovered an unprecedented, organized, and planned Japanese secret military organization that attempted to launch large-scale riots in the city. At that time, the headquarters dispatched its entire staff to raid the hideout in the dead of night, capturing all the perpetrators in one fell swoop. A total of 26 key Chinese and Japanese criminals were apprehended, and a large quantity of military fire, ammunition, forged symbols, radios, military telephones, super-adhesive agents, armor, and other items were seized. After several interrogations by the military law office, due to the seriousness of the case, a platoon of soldiers was specially dispatched yesterday to escort them to the Nanjing Army Headquarters. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>One Sweep Nets 26 Criminals</p>
<p>In early last month, the Investigation Department of the Songhu Garrison Headquarters learned that the Japanese had established a secret military organization in Shanghai, intending to disrupt public order. The department immediately dispatched its staff to investigate in all directions. After obtaining leads, they surrounded and raided the hideouts on the 11th of last month in the dead of night. At 142 Yalu Road, the main culprit, Miyarazhi, also known as Miyarazhi, and his accomplices Chen Yifei, Chen Congzhi, Dai Yongren, Li Qin, Zhang Defa, Jin Zhuxin, Lin Qingquan, Jiang Bingzhi, and Zhenye, a total of ten people, were captured.

<p>Symbols and Communication Tools Seized</p>
<p>When arresting the criminals, various forged documents were seized from the residence of the main culprit, Miyarazhi. Among them were two wooden seals of the ×× Seaboard Command of the ×th Detachment of the ×th Column of a certain war zone, nine letters of appointment, 68 "Dewei" symbols, a thick volume of condensed versions of the Asahi Shimbun, and a certificate issued by the puppet Manchurian government authorizing him to conduct espionage activities. From Lin Shen's residence, two Mauser rifles, 405 rounds of ammunition, five military telephones, two special wall telephones, six square shelves, one radio transmitter, a heap of radio transmitter parts, two boxes of gunpowder, three military swords, two binoculars, two cameras, six packages of super-adhesive agents of various sizes, a set of armor, thirty-six sets of military uniforms, one crowbar, and one steel helmet were seized. From Xu Weili's residence, six various pistols were seized. From Shen Zhongqiang's residence, eleven various pistols were seized.</p>
<p>Main Culprit Confesses to Secret Activities</p>
<p>According to the confession of the main culprit, Miyarazhi, during the interrogation at the military law office, he had previously served as the magistrate of Nong'an County in the puppet Manchuria, handling espionage work. Later, he was assigned to the puppet Manchuria Coal Mining Corporation to investigate the situation of laborers in Jinan, Wucheng, and En County.

According to Lin Shen's confession, before the incident, he had opened a Reiyan Pharmaceutical Factory and jointly opened a Zhenya Pharmaceutical Factory in Shanghai. After the victory, he served as the "Commander of the Second Detachment of the Jingtai Security Column of the Huainan Administrative Office of Jiangsu Province" and was an old acquaintance of Miyarazhi.

<h3>U.S. Military Headquarters Eliminates Black Market Trade, Confiscates Military Medicines</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] The U.S. Military Headquarters in this city announced yesterday that, in order to continue efforts to eliminate black market trade in Shanghai, its Criminal Investigation Division, in conjunction with the Municipal Police Department, confiscated military medicines stored in three pharmacies in the city on Thursday. The quantity of these medicines was not announced, but it included some penicillin, a small amount of sulfide agents, typhoid and cholera injections, and some vitamin pills.</p>
<p>The U.S. Military Investigation Division stated that it had long suspected that some pharmacies in the city were selling U.S. military drugs. After active investigation for a week, the most significant find was made this time. On New Year's Eve last year, a small amount of milk powder, coffee, sugar, oatmeal, white tower oil, and chocolate were seized, as well as military clothing. The department also raided a private residence and seized a large quantity of candies rationed to U.S. soldiers. They also seized a large amount of military food when searching a bar on Zhubao 3rd Road. The bar's license to allow U.S. soldiers to enter was revoked. Among the pharmacies searched on Thursday, the owner of one was arrested and will be further investigated.</p>
<p>The division also stated that no military personnel have been identified as being involved in the raids of the past week. However, twenty-five people, linked to black market transactions from the previous two months, will be tried and punished. Among the defendants, some are officers, who are accused of stealing government property, such as air force equipment, watches, aviation clocks, cameras, telescopes, clothing, and food, worth more than US$50,000. If found guilty, they could face five to ten years of imprisonment and will be discharged from the military.</p>
<p>The division also stated that, although there is currently no evidence of organized military participation in black market activities, individuals will still be severely punished. Military personnel who sell military supplies or public property after purchasing them will also be punished for illegally handling public property and promoting black market trade.</p>

<h3>Yesterday's Negotiations Fail to Yield Results; Labor Demands Fair Treatment</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Workers at the American-owned Shanghai Power Company's Yangshupu Power Plant went on strike at approximately 5 PM the day before yesterday due to a dispute over treatment. This resulted in a power outage in several areas in western and northern Shanghai for over an hour, causing a loss of 20,000 watts of electricity. Upon hearing the news, the municipal Party, government, military, and police authorities dispatched personnel to mediate. The labor side accepted the advice and immediately resumed work. Labor and management held a meeting at the Social Bureau yesterday afternoon at 2 PM to discuss the matter.</p>
<p>Labor Demands Implementation of Agreement</p>
<p>The meeting began with informal discussions between worker representatives and Wang Xianqing, representing the municipal Party headquarters. Subsequently, Zhou Xuexiang, representing the General Labor Union; Chuan Shaowei, representing the Police Bureau; Cheng Yanren, representing the Shanghai Eastern District Investigation Office of the Songhu Garrison Headquarters; Zheng Xi, representing the Public Utilities Bureau; and Frederick, the vice president of the company, and Lu Gen, the personnel section chief, from the management side were in attendance. The labor side was represented by seven people from the Yangshupu Power Plant, four people from the Feilen Road Distribution Station, and four people from the Nanjing Road headquarters. Wang Xianqing chaired the meeting. The labor representatives presented their views and submitted a written copy of the ten articles of the agreement reached between both sides on September 29th of last year, demanding that the management immediately implement them and determine specific methods for doing so. These included: (1) Equal pay for equal work; (2) Improved welfare; (3) Wage adjustment; (4) Wage increase; (5) The ability to borrow 75% of pension funds in times of urgent need; (6) Changing the original 15-year pension period to 12 years; (7) Submission of revised pension regulations to the government for approval; (8) Labor representatives will report any former employees who took positions under the puppet regime and harmed the company, and the company will not re-employ them; (9) Issuance of wartime relief funds, which both sides agreed to retain; (10) The company authorities recognize Ouyang Zurun, Zhou Weixin, and seventeen others as representatives. Before formally beginning negotiations, Zhang Zhenyuan from the Social Bureau reported on the previous mediation efforts.</p>
<p>Wage Issue Remains Unresolved</p>
<p>Wang Xianqing then proceeded to discuss the issue of equal pay for equal work. Frederick from the management side stated that the company was gradually adjusting salaries, but there were many difficulties preventing rapid completion. Labor representatives cited facts regarding the unequal treatment of White Russians and Chinese workers. Frederick immediately stated that he would investigate and adjust accordingly. The discussion then turned to the wage issue. Frederick stated that base salaries had already been adjusted and that this had been met with criticism from various parties, so he would not agree to further adjustments. Zhang Zhenyuan from the Social Bureau raised several points regarding the wage issue, which Frederick responded to, but no concrete solution was reached. The atmosphere in the meeting became increasingly tense. Wang Xianqing proposed that the discussion continue next Monday afternoon at 2 PM.</p>
<p>Significant Salary Disparity Between Chinese and Foreign Employees</p>
<p>Reportedly, the current salaries of Chinese employees at the power company range from 30,000 to 40,000 yuan per month, accounting for 70% of the workforce; 20% earn between 40,000 and 70,000 yuan; and only 10% earn over 70,000 yuan. In contrast, foreign employees' salaries often range from 700,000 or 800,000 to over one million yuan. Therefore, although foreign employees account for only one-tenth of the total workforce, their salaries account for half of the company's total salary expenditure.</p>
<p>French Tram Company Also Submits Demands</p>
<p>The French Tram Company typically pays wages on the 5th of the month, but the company suddenly announced the other day that it would be delayed until the 7th and did not provide a concrete response to workers' demands for wage adjustments. Therefore, all employees are considering a work slowdown. Upon learning of this, the Social Bureau sent Zhang Zhenyuan to mediate. The company authorities agreed to raise funds to pay wages on schedule, but the labor side must adhere to the newly revised wage standards set by the Social Bureau on December 27th of last year and not make excessive demands. Yesterday afternoon, four labor representatives went to the Social Bureau to discuss other related matters. A work slowdown may not occur.</p>
<h3>Vaccinate Against Smallpox Immediately Upon Detection</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Secretary Dai of the Bureau of Health informed reporters yesterday that smallpox is prevalent in the Yangtze River basin, including Jiujiang and Yichang.

<h3>Strengthening Transportation of Relief Supplies; I Lease Ships from England; Relief Administration Says It Will Not Harm Shipping Rights</h3>
<p>Regarding the Executive Yuan's Post-War Relief Administration's use of British ships to transport relief supplies, the Shanghai shipping industry believes that the Administration is transferring shipping rights, allowing British ships to operate in coastal ports and along the Yangtze River. The Ministry of Economic Affairs' Resources Committee has now decided to establish a Shanghai Machinery Factory in Shanghai. Its office has been selected on the third floor of the City Bank on Jiujiang Road. The factory will first establish the Second and Third Factories, which will be transferred from the enemy and puppet machine factories received by the Special Commissioner of the Ministry of Economic Affairs for the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui regions. These include: (1) the Continental Machinery Factory on Gordon Road; (2) the Toyota Automobile Factory on Hejian Road; (3) the Changhe Manufacturing Plant on Tangshan Road. The Shanghai Machinery Factory is currently in the process of handover and will begin operations within days, initially manufacturing machine tools and automobile parts. The position of factory director has also been appointed to Bei Jiyao, the former director of the Central Machinery Factory in Kunming, Yunnan. Bei has already arrived in Shanghai and is beginning preparations for resuming work. They are in the process of signing a treaty to lease British merchant ships to transport relief supplies along China's coast and inland waterways, as the Joint Relief Agency will have an average of one relief ship arriving in China every day, each carrying 8,000 to 10,000 tons of supplies. This means that approximately 300,000 tons of relief supplies can be transported to China each month. To facilitate the rapid transfer of these supplies to various parts of the country and accelerate reconstruction, the decision was made to lease ships from the British government to strengthen transportation. The spokesperson also stated that they believe that signing this treaty will not harm China's sovereignty and will not hinder coastal and inland waterway transportation.</p>
<p>Sunken Ships Discovered Near Shandong</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] There are many obstacles in the Jianghai shipping lanes after the victory. Although the Allied mine-sweeping vessels have cleared most of them, Jiangping, a ship of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company captained by Shipmaster Ji Yu, reported that it discovered four sunken ships near Shandong Cape during its trip from Qinhuangdao to Shanghai. They are all located near 31 degrees north latitude and 112 degrees east longitude. Shipmasters should pay attention.</p>
<p>Strict Review of Ship Registration</p>
<p>The Navigation Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Transportation has noted that among the ships applied for registration by various shipping companies, most belong to legitimate owners, but a few ships have unclear origins. Therefore, if the bureau discovers any ships that were owned by the enemy or puppet regime and are being claimed as one's own and applied for registration, they will be severely punished. As a result, the bureau is now extremely strict with the review conditions for registration documents.</p>
<h3>Warehouse Inventory Will Take Time</h3>
<p>The Jianghai Customs' warehouse inventory work, which began on November 9th, has been underway for nearly two months. So far, over 700 warehouses have been inventoried. According to related parties, this task is expected to take another three months to complete. A large number of enemy and puppet warehouses have not yet been inventoried. The Customs will continue to carry out the inventory after the original receiving agency hands them over. The inventory of goods stored in Chinese-owned warehouses and silver and money industry warehouses has also begun. Items that are not owned by the enemy or puppet regime will be processed and returned.</p>
<h3>Industrial Association Requests Government Assistance for Industrial Revival</h3>
<p>The National Industrial Association, in order to request the government's assistance in industrial revival, sent representatives to petition the central government, requesting assistance in the following areas: (1) Regarding the allocation of enemy and puppet factories, they expressed dissatisfaction with the current bidding method; (2) Requesting low-interest loans from the Central Bank; (3) Using Japanese reparations to assist factories in resuming operations; (4) Following the central government's example of exempting land taxes, exempting industrial products from taxation for one year; (5) Subsidizing technicians from the rear to come to Shanghai to resume work; (6) Assisting in transporting machinery from the rear to Shanghai. The central government agreed to consider the above six points in detail and then determine a method.</p>
<h3>Shanghai to Implement Legalized Prostitution to Regulate Public Morality</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Since the closure of massage parlors, escort agencies, and singing girl agencies in the city, which came into effect on New Year's Day, hundreds of people have directly faced unemployment, and indirectly affecting the livelihood of thousands of people. The authorities are currently drafting a plan to deal with the aftermath. It is rumored that the existence of legalized prostitution will be permitted in the short term in order to help a large number of prostitutes find alternative work. Director Bao of the First Division of the Police Bureau told reporters yesterday that the legalized prostitution system will be based on three principles: (1) Converting private into public, prohibiting the existence of private prostitutes, in order to facilitate management and inspection; (2) Consolidating scattered operations into organized operations, in order to delineate areas of vice; (3) Simplifying procedures, prohibiting the creation of various deceptive names for prostitution. Names must be unified, and businesses must display licenses to facilitate identification.</p>
<h3>Two Dance Halls Closed for Four Days</h3>
<p>In addition to strictly enforcing the closure of escort agencies, massage parlors, and other disguised brothels, the city's police authorities have also restricted the operating hours of dance halls and stipulated that seating is not allowed on the dance floor. The other night, the Vienna and MGM dance halls on Xizang Road were fined and ordered to close for four days for violating the regulations and adding extra seats. It is rumored that each police precinct will send personnel at any time to investigate whether dance halls, cafes, and other establishments have violated regulations. Those with more serious violations will have their business licenses revoked.</p>
<h3>Holders of Belgian Currency and Stocks Should Register On Time</h3>
<p>According to the Belgian Consulate General in Shanghai: (1) All holders of Belgian currency must register with the Belgian Consulate General at 1300 Fuxing Road, Shanghai, before January 31, 1946. (2) All holders of bonds and bearer stocks of Belgium or the Belgian Congo must register with the Sino-Belgian Bank in Shanghai before January 31, 1946. (3) In accordance with the laws promulgated by Belgium on October 6, 1944, and May 30, 1945, the above-mentioned currency, bonds, and stocks will be invalidated if the holder fails to register before the deadline. The public is advised to take note.</p>
<h3>Winter Relief Association Focuses on Vocational Training</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Shanghai Winter Relief Association held a reception for newspaper reporters at 2:30 PM yesterday, at which Feng Zhifang, representing the Association, reported on the progress of the work. It was stated that seven shelters have now been selected: (1) The Qingjietang Shelter, which has already begun to take in 504 refugees; (2) The Charity Association Joint Committee, which can accommodate approximately 500 people; (3) The Catholic Charity Association on Mackenzie Road; (4) The Mackenzie Road Shelter, which is currently repairing houses and is expected to begin taking in people around the 10th; (5) The Lujiabang Shelter, where temporary sheds are being built on vacant land; (6) The Zhabei Charity Association; (7) The Caohejing Shelter, whose houses have been approved by the Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau for unsealing and allocation, with the capacity to accommodate approximately 1,000 people. The goal is to accommodate a total of 3,000 people. The methods for taking in people are: one, self-referral, but subject to review; and two, street collection. All refugees admitted to the shelters are subject to strict management and are not allowed to enter or leave freely without permission, in order to prevent abuses.</p>
<p>Food and Supplies</p>
<p>The Post-War Relief Administration has agreed to supply 3,000 bags of flour and 3,000 sets of clothing per month, as well as beds. It will also be able to purchase 30 tons of coal from the Administration at a price of 30,000 yuan per ton. However, the Administration will not provide medical supplies. The total cost is 100 million yuan, which depends entirely on the enthusiastic donations of caring individuals.</p>
<p>Donations have been entrusted to various newspapers and major banks for collection, and the names of donors will be publicly announced daily to ensure transparency. Administrative expenses will be paid by the municipal government, so even the smallest donation will be used for the refugees, in line with the relief objectives. It is rumored that the Association's management will focus on education and vocational training, and will introduce work to those who pass the assessment, such as street cleaners and laborers, so that they can become productive members of society in the future, thus making the meaning of relief work more proactive.</p>
<p>Another Batch of Japanese Residents and Prisoners of War in Shanghai Sent Away; Deportation to be Completed Within Nine Months</p>
<p>The fourth batch of ships carrying Japanese residents and prisoners of war back to their country set sail for Japan yesterday afternoon. There were a total of four ships, including three landing craft and one small transport ship. According to the Shanghai Port Transportation Command, the four ships carried a total of 3,339 Japanese residents and prisoners of war. All of these residents and prisoners of war completed their inspection the day before yesterday. They boarded the ships yesterday morning and departed at 2 PM. It is reported that landing craft will be regularly dispatched in rotation to send them back to Japan. It is estimated that the more than 700,000 Japanese residents and prisoners of war remaining in Shanghai will be deported within nine months.</p>
<p>Naval Prisoners of War to be Taken Over Within Days</p>
<p>The Shanghai Office of the Naval Headquarters has been ordered to close, and personnel from the Naval Department of the Ministry of Military Administration will take over. The Japanese naval prisoners of war in Shanghai, which it was originally responsible for, will also be taken over by the Shanghai Japanese Resident and Prisoner of War Management Office, under orders. It has been found that there are two Japanese naval concentration camps in the Shanghai area, one on Fuxing Island and one in Pudong. The Fuxing Island camp was originally scheduled to be taken over by the Management Office today, but because today is Sunday, the transfer has been changed to tomorrow. The Pudong camp currently has 3,490 former Japanese naval marines, 211 former members of the Shanghai base headquarters, and 338 people concentrated from various Japanese warships, for a total of 4,039 people. Yesterday afternoon, Deputy Director Zhou Ren of the Management Office took a special ship to inspect the camp. Katsuno Minoru, the former commander of the Shanghai Marines, who was sentenced to two months in prison for concealing the criminals in the shooting of the American soldiers and failing to report it, was recently released from prison on December 21st of last year. Upon learning that Zhou's group was coming to inspect the camp, he led the team to the riverbank to welcome them. Zhou inquired in detail about the current situation of the camp and gave instructions to Katsuno Minoru and others, explaining the future management and educational policies and setting a date for the takeover within days. Finally, he inspected the entire camp. Because the houses in the camp are relatively few, many of the Japanese naval prisoners of war are living in tents. The internal equipment is better than that of the Japanese army prisoners of war. In addition to a portion of the prisoners of war being assigned to perform labor, some are staying in tents, operating sewing machines, and doing work such as knitting wool, just like women doing needlework. However, most of them have packed their luggage and are waiting to be sent home.</p>

<p>Police Bureau Orders Reconstruction of Lane Signs</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] In the past, during the era of the Shanghai Municipal Council, the house numbers of residents in each lane were arranged on wooden signs at the entrance of the lane. Now, due to the passage of time, some lane signs are incomplete. The Police Bureau has now ordered the reconstruction of lane signs, with residents of each lane raising funds to customize them. Each sign is 60 inches high and 10 inches wide, with the lane name plate 3 inches high. Each police precinct has been ordered to implement this, with completion scheduled by the 20th of the month.

<h3>Water Shortage in Shanghai Suburbs Not Reduced</h3>
<p>Recently, the water supply to residences with tap water in the suburbs of Shanghai, especially those above the second floor, has been constantly cut off, causing great inconvenience to residents. Reporters inquired with the water company. According to a senior employee of the company, during the enemy and puppet period, the supply of tap water was restricted due to insufficient coal. Therefore, the general public also restricted their usage, so the water shortage was not too great. However, after the victory of the war, citizens took a laissez-faire attitude towards water usage, while the company's facilities have not yet been restored, and damaged machinery has not yet been completely repaired. Users in the urban area above the second floor have reported water cuts, and those farther away have no water at all. The company is well aware of the difficulties and is actively stepping up repairs. It is expected that the supply will be restored soon.</p>

<h3>Twenty-Nine Prisoners Executed, Only One Left Alive: Yang Wendao, Wrongfully Accused, Hopes for Early Release</h3>
<p>— Our Reporter, Ping Qi</p>
<p>Yang Wendao, implicated in the Zhongshan Hideo blood case ten years ago and wrongly convicted and sentenced to death, has recently appealed for a retrial to overturn the unjust verdict, arousing widespread public sympathy and a sense of justice. Following our presentation of this "prisoner's" tearful story to our readers the day before yesterday, today we record the details of our visit with Yang Wendao in prison:</p>
<p>Inhumanity in Every Word, Tears in Every Sentence</p>
<p>Located within the grim, gray, high walls of the Tilanqiao Shanghai Prison, it feels like stepping into a "city of the dead," where even breathing seems difficult. The corridors are lined with heavy iron doors, and prison guards walk silently back and forth. We waited in a bare room for Yang Wendao, who had been under a death sentence for ten years.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the sharp, cold sound of keys rang out, and the iron door was pulled open. Several bailiffs escorted a man out. He was wearing a gray cotton prison uniform and trousers. He was short in stature, with a sallow and aged complexion. The top of his head was already bald, but the eyes of this man, weathered by suffering, were full of excitement.</p>
<p>A bailiff said loudly to me, "This is Yang Wendao!"</p>
<p>For ten years, only his son, Hanzhi, had been able to visit him weekly, speaking for three to five minutes through the iron bars. This time, as a reporter meeting him, perhaps for the first time he was hearing the voice of someone who sympathized with him. He said excitedly, "I was kidnapped like baggage by Japanese detectives from the police station on April 19th of the twenty-fifth year of the Republic, and imprisoned on Dixui Road. Every day at twelve o'clock, they would hang me in the special room of the Fourth Avenue Police Station for torture. They would blindfold me, tie me to a tiger bench, and pour cold water into my nostrils, demanding that I confess I was following government orders as an assassin, specifically to assassinate Japanese. They stripped me naked and forced me to kneel on two sharp small stones, with my upper body held perfectly straight... Oh God, my knees were ruined!"</p>
<p>Misfortunes Never Come Singly, Everything Burned to the Ground</p>
<p>For over six months, until he was sentenced to death on October 2nd, he endured daily beatings and abuse. After the sentencing, he was transferred to Tilanqiao, where he became a "death row inmate" awaiting execution.</p>
<p>His body was covered in wounds and he was shackled. Each day, he was only allowed to walk three circles in the prison yard and was forbidden to leave his cell. Despite his grievances, he was not allowed to speak here.</p>
<p>His home was on Tangshan Road, very close to the prison, yet it seemed so far away to him. During the "August 13th Incident," the fierce artillery fire left the iron walls of Tilanqiao Prison unscathed, but his home on Tangshan Road was burned to the ground. The Japanese had occupied Shanghai.</p>
<p>Thirty death row inmates were housed on the fifth floor of the prison's "RD" building. From time to time, groups of two or three were taken away for execution in large trucks. In the bitter winter, Hanzhi would rush to the Nanshi execution ground before dawn to wait. Every time he saw a large truck coming from Tilanqiao, he would carefully search, his heart aching. For over ten days, from eight in the morning to three in the afternoon, his father was not among them.</p>
<p>Thirty Prisoners, One Left Alive</p>
<p>Yang Wendao waited as his fellow inmates were taken away one by one, until only two remained. One morning, the "Number Twenty-Nine" prisoner suddenly received wine. His time had come. Yang Wendao drank heavily with him. "Number Twenty-Nine" was taken away on the "big truck" that day. Now, only Yang Wendao remained.</p>
<p>Yet Yang Wendao was never called. The truth was that the prison authorities knew he was innocent, so they did not reveal his case file when the Japanese occupied Shanghai.</p>
<p>Outside the iron window, the setting sun cast a faint light. A line of prisoners in gray cotton coats walked past silently. Yang Wendao, with tears in his eyes, said, "Ten years of suffering. Heaven has blessed me with a chance for redress. I want nothing else. I only hope to see my children soon—I only hope to go home soon."</p>
<h3>Expansion of Jielu Road and Zhejiang Road: Municipal Government Orders Demolition of Houses by Year-End, with Owners Responsible for Demolition Costs</h3>
<p>(Report from this Newspaper) The Municipal Government considers Jielu Road and Zhejiang Road, located near the North Railway Station, to be crucial transportation arteries. However, the road surfaces are too narrow, causing significant inconvenience for vehicular traffic. A decision has been made to widen Jielu Road to 30 meters and Zhejiang Road to 20 meters. Regarding the widening of Zhejiang Road, it is reported that the authorities are considering starting with the sections north of Suzhou Creek and south of Fuzhou Road. Our reporter has learned from the Municipal Government that houses obstructing the widening of these two roads must be demolished by the end of the thirty-fifth year of the Republic, with the property owners responsible for the demolition costs and the police department providing supervision. It is also reported that after the widening of these two roads, the property owners along the roads will benefit from the improved transportation, and the Finance Bureau will collect corresponding fees from them. As for compensation for property losses incurred by the public due to the road widening, the Municipal Government has not yet decided on a compensation plan.</p>
<p>Extending North Xizang Road</p>
<p>The streets and roads in the Huangpu District of this city are congested with traffic, causing difficulties. In addition to actively repairing damaged road surfaces, the bureau is starting to widen Jielu Road and Paoma Road. It is also reported that plans are underway to extend North Xizang Road to connect with Song Park Road, to facilitate transportation from the Northeast to Jielu Road and directly to the North Railway Station, benefiting transportation between the railway station and western Shanghai.</p>

<h3>Welcoming the China Electric Drama Troupe</h3>
<p>— Li Lin</p>
<p>At a time when Shanghai's theater scene is trending towards a low ebb, the news that the China Electric Drama Troupe has set off east from Chongqing is like a stimulant for us. It brings us new strength and hope, just like a fresh force arriving when the situation is critical.</p>
<p>Undeniably, Shanghai's theater world is facing an unprecedented crisis. Foreign films are taking away many of our audiences and theaters. However, this crisis is not irremediable. After four years of absence, foreign films naturally have a unique, bewitching appeal, but this is ultimately a temporary phenomenon. Once the audience's fervor for foreign films subsides somewhat, spoken drama may still be able to rise again. The appeal of foreign films is not irresistible; it depends on our efforts. Movies and theater each have their irreducible advantages, and they both have a reason to exist because of their unique qualities. The recent prosperity of the only three remaining spoken drama theaters in Shanghai is good proof of this. However, fierce competition is unavoidable. The reason the three remaining spoken drama theaters can compete with movie theaters is because of the excellence of their chosen plays and the strength of their cast. Therefore, in the future, we only need to focus on improving the standard of performance, and spoken drama is not without a future. As for the theater panic, it is only a temporary phenomenon. Merchants are short-sighted and only interested in profit. Once our audience returns to our theaters and spoken drama business equals or even exceeds that of movies, theaters will not be a problem.</p>
<p>The problem before us is how to improve our performance standards. In the commercialized Shanghai theater scene, due to the continuous increase in theatrical troupes, reaching as many as twelve during the peak, the quality of actors has greatly decreased, manpower has been dispersed, and work attitudes have become less serious. Therefore, when faced with a strong rival like foreign films, we feel a great threat. Therefore, we must currently focus on improving our performance standards and improving our work attitude.</p>
<p>We have long heard of the China Electric Drama Troupe's great reputation in Chongqing. Not only is the selection of plays extremely careful, but the cast is also very well-organized. Most valuable is the strong academic atmosphere that permeates the troupe. They maintain a serious work style. In addition, the troupe's leader, Mr. Zhang Junxiang, is a rare all-around talent in the country. This is truly a powerful new force for Shanghai's future theater scene.</p>
<p>The plays that "China Electric" has performed in Chongqing include: "Model Teacher for All Ages," "Return of Spring to the Earth," "Song of Righteousness," "Mountain City Story," and "Golden Jade Full House." The characteristic of their performances is that they emphasize the average development of actors, do not rely on one or two famous actors as a selling point, and pay special attention to cooperation between actors. Their actors are very average in terms of acting skills, and their quality is very excellent, unlike the unevenness of ordinary troupes.</p>
<p>I heard that the members of "China Electric" are traveling by car to Yuanling, then transferring to Changsha, passing through Hankou, and heading east along the Yangtze River. They have already passed Changsha; they should arrive in Shanghai within about a week. At the same time, Mr. Zhang Junxiang arrived in Shanghai a month earlier to prepare for the performances and recruit outstanding talents to join "China Electric." In this way, the lineup of "China Electric" will be even stronger. I eagerly hope to see the performances of "China Electric" soon, to satisfy our thirst.</p>
<p>Before "China Electric" arrives in Shanghai, I would like to express our warm welcome and hope that "China Electric" is not only our new force but also our role model, forming a strong front with us to rescue Shanghai's current theater crisis.</p>
<h3>Reminiscing About Chongqing</h3>
<p>— Sha Tong</p>
<p>Chongqing is a mountain city protruding between the Yangtze River and the Jialing River. It rarely sees the sun throughout the year, and walking requires climbing hills. The lives of theater and film people are as difficult as those of ordinary civil servants. Therefore, when victory came, everyone wanted to go east quickly. However, I was one of the first reporters to come down, but I also miss Chongqing the most. I lived in Chongqing for eight years, which can be said to be eight years of hard struggle. We not only forged a new way of life, but also forged a new way of working. For example, during the Great Bombing and the so-called continuous fatigue bombing, we not only had to hide in air-raid shelters, but also had to learn rescue work, protect equipment, shoot newsreels, and use the time spent in air-raid shelters to read scripts. For example, when prices were high and resources were not enough to distribute, how did everyone organize and manage food groups? We not only had to buy vegetables ourselves but also grow vegetables and even raise pigs. This kind of life was hard enough, but when you think back to it, it was really flavorful.</p>
<p>Chongqing had very few entertainment and leisure places. Frankly speaking, even if there were, theater and film people like us could not afford to go. Therefore, the small teahouse near the film studio became the club for film and theater people. There, three or five people sat at a table, and there were even reclining chairs. Some rested, some read scripts, some held meetings to discuss performance methods, some wrote articles, and some even met guests there. When hungry, they could order a few bowls of "dandan noodles" to eat. "Dandan noodles" are a specialty of Sichuan, both economical and delicious. Xie Tian could eat five or six bowls in a row. The architecture of this kind of teahouse was naturally very simple. Maybe it was just a grass shed built with bamboo mats under the shade of a big yellow tree, or a dilapidated old house. However, female stars such as Bai Yang were frequent guests. Therefore, Chongqing movie fans who wanted to admire female stars only needed to frequent the small teahouses near the film studio or across from the Cathay Grand Theater, and they could always achieve their goal. However, the words "female star" were not noticeable in Chongqing because they themselves were very ordinary, as plain as an ordinary female student.</p>
<p>I said that walking in Chongqing requires climbing hills. Some people say that crossing a river is like swinging on a swing. Going down a slope and then up another, isn't that swinging on a swing? Those mountain cities were not the stairs of Western-style houses, so they were naturally uneven. Therefore, the ladies and wives living in Chongqing rarely wore high heels. We could see female stars wearing boots, but we didn't see them wearing high heels. Therefore, the actors playing modern women in several plays were not used to the gait of high heels.</p>
<p>During the bombing period, filming work was really impossible to promote. Chongqing in the summer certainly had the sun, but it was also good weather for bombing. Because of the bombing, the supply of electricity and light became a problem. The fog season was certainly not afraid of bombing, but it lacked the sun, and the supply of electricity was still not ideal. Therefore, the lagging behind of film production was inevitable. On the contrary, spoken drama made great progress. During the bombing period, plays were rehearsed, and once the fog season arrived, each troupe became active in the mountain city at the same time.</p>
<p>Although living in a situation where all material conditions were difficult, the film and theater people of Chongqing were able to live and work more strongly. Therefore, I miss Chongqing very much.</p>
<h3>The Fatal Wound of Spoken Drama—Lack of Venues</h3>
<p>— Jun Yi</p>
<p>In the past month, many spoken drama workers have rushed from the mainland, but they are still wandering aimlessly, with nothing to do, becoming "heroes with no place to use their skills." The lack of venues has formed the most serious problem in the current spoken drama industry. Before peace, there were more than ten spoken drama theaters in the city, but currently, they have gradually decreased to only three. Speaking honestly, most of those who "make a living from spoken drama" in Shanghai in recent years have been able to work hard in their positions and have managed to grasp a large customer base. Now that victory has come, they have lost their original positions!</p>
<p>In the mainland, spoken drama is inseparable from the public, and similarly, the public cannot leave spoken drama. During the War of Resistance, it has tried its best to exert the power of spoken drama itself, and therefore it has also attracted the attention of the authorities. Many scripts have won the government's awards, and many workers have also received the help of manpower and material resources that the wartime government cherished. Therefore, a few days ago, I met a spoken drama worker from the mainland. When he arrived in Shanghai, he was surprised why spoken drama here has remained so neglected for so many years. On the contrary, local operas seem to have made significant progress. In fact, this gentleman is suffering from nearsightedness. Has he ever seen the booming scene four or five months ago!</p>
<p>Due to the gradual opening of Western film sources, cinema merchants have discovered that running spoken drama is not only too troublesome but also does not have the lucrative interest of screening movies. They mercilessly kicked out that group of spoken drama groups, even though they knew that these workers had also contributed their efforts and made them rich. It's really like what Mr. Li Jianwu said: "So we fall into the utilitarian hearts of these merchants"! In fact, these cinema merchants are also suffering from nearsightedness. In the situation where our own domestic films cannot be produced in large quantities for a while, is there any guarantee that these Western films will not make the audience sick in the future? In the bags of a group of mainland playwrights in Shanghai, there are rich treasures. Why don't the merchants here take out the keys to open them for them?</p>
<p>Two months ago, I heard that several theaters received from the enemy and puppet sides were prepared to be supplied to personnel returning from the mainland, and a public theater management committee has been established. This is indeed a great piece of good news in the venue shortage. I hope that the past Shanghai spoken drama teams can cooperate with each other. They will definitely produce a brilliant future, and millions of spoken drama audiences may as well wait and see!</p>
<h3>"Laments of the Late Ming Dynasty"</h3>
<p>Yesterday at noon, there was a gathering at the Kangle Restaurant on Jing'an Temple Road. Jiang Bocheng, Wu Kaixian, Wan Molin, and others hosted a banquet for famous figures from the spoken drama and Peking opera circles, as well as important central party and government officials, to raise funds for the Shanghai Municipal Association for Comrades Who Suffered Hardships and the preparations for public performances of spoken drama and Peking opera. Niu Yongjian, Pan Gongzhan, Wang Xiaolai, and Mei Lanfang, Zhou Xinfang, Zhang Junxiang, Gu Zhongyi, Fei Mu, Xu Suling, and others attended to discuss preparations for theatrical performances to raise funds. Mrs. Jiang Bocheng was enthusiastic about planning and was quite active. The play list and performance methods were decided at the time. Zhou Xinfang immediately agreed to perform famous plays such as Laments of the Late Ming Dynasty. The spoken drama circle also decided that each troupe would participate in the performance separately. If the "China Electric" troupe could catch up, they would participate with "Model Teacher for All Ages." At that time, Shanghai theater fans will be able to feast their eyes.</p>
<h3>Short Film Reviews</h3>
<p>— Lai Ming</p>
<p>Recently, Hollywood films have been arriving in Shanghai in a steady stream, making every movie fan feel very excited. However, according to letters from the mainland, especially the Hollywood films screened in the wartime capital were the most. However, most of the films screened in Shanghai were screened in the wartime capital. In recent days, there are several ten films in Shanghai that can be introduced.</p>
<p>1.  National Soul</p>
<p>Is a worthwhile introduction of a good film; The heroine of this film is Irene Dunne, and the hero is Alan Marshall. The whole plot uses a flashback method to narrate an elderly British nurse in an American military hospital, recalling her husband. After he was born in London, she took her beloved son and lived far away in the United States; Later, when her son grew up, the Second World War broke out, so she dedicated her son to the country with loyalty and bravery, and joined the hospital to serve. The whole purpose of the film is a great era of motherhood. Irene Dunne's acting skills are also quite accomplished, and this film is worth a look for the motherhood in our country.</p>
<p>2.  Dream Quest</p>
<p>Is a French people, in the occupied area, the history of patriotic enthusiasm, the protagonist of this film, is Humphrey Bogart, who has given us a very deep image in "The Tiger General of the Lonely City", and of course has better acting skills in this film. This film also uses a flashback method to narrate the plot; The beginning of the story is that Captain Sinna (Claude Rains) of the Free French Air Force at the British base narrates to a reporter about the origins of the members of the squadron.</p>
<p>Malek (Humphrey Bogart) and four other French youths escaped from prison and fled overseas; After a fierce battle on a giant ship, they finally reached England peacefully, and then joined the Free French Air Force to serve the motherland. In the end, Malek was moved to tears by the audience in the scene where he died in a brave air battle, and the film was fought by our people.</p>
<p>3.  Peach Blossom Palace</p>
<p>Fred Astaire, Rita Hayworth, these two Hollywood stars, especially Fred is the Hollywood dance emperor, his funny face and brisk steps; Made every audience praised; Rita Hayworth's enchanting beauty in the past "Blood and Sand" has fascinated many movie fans. In this film, Rita plays the daughter of a wealthy merchant. She suddenly receives a letter from an anonymous youth every day, and in the end, those letters are written by her father, causing a burst of laughter. Fred plays an unemployed dancer who unintentionally falls in love with the daughter of a wealthy merchant and becomes husband and wife. The new songs and dances in this film are particularly outstanding, so this film is just a song and dance comedy.</p>
<p>4.  Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves</p>
<p>Since the film Savage Girl was screened in Shanghai, it has caused a sensation among audiences throughout Shanghai. The protagonist of this film is the same as Savage Girl, the heroine is Maria Montez, and the hero is Jon Hall. After the war, major Hollywood film companies were recruiting troops, and Universal Pictures was the best. Among the discoveries of new stars, Maria Montez was the most popular, and Jon Hall's acting skills in the past "Stormy Wedding" and "Mermaid" were quite sophisticated. His brown skin and tall body are really worthy of playing the leading role of Ali Baba.</p>
<p>The whole film tells the story of a Baghdad prince in Asia Minor who was reduced to Ali Baba among the Forty Thieves by a traitorous courtier; Ten years later, Alian was twenty years old and determined to take revenge. After many difficulties, he avenged the unshared hatred; Among them, the scene where Ali Baba shouted to open the mountain gate was particularly moving; In addition to Maria Montez and Jon Hall, Don Buke's role as Dane Mick is also quite accomplished. This film is a masterpiece with the same effect as "Box in the Moon Palace".</p>
<h3>History of the Invention of Film</h3>
<p>Film is really a friend that we are too familiar with, but few people know its origin, and even fewer remember its birthday. The general public always thinks that its origin is the United States, but in fact, it was born in France exactly fifty years ago. The first person to invent the film died in poverty and became an unsung hero. The successful inventor was still alive twelve years ago. From the success of the experiment to the present, it has been through fifty years, "black and white" to "color", "silent" to "talking" and many other reforms to have today. In the near future, there may be "three-dimensional" "smell" and "wireless transmission of "see the shadow and hear the sound" and other developments. Wednesday, December 26th of this year, happens to be the 50th anniversary of the successful invention of film. Film merchants and old theater operators who have benefited from films seem to should express something at that time.</p>
<h3>Regarding "Lili Grass"</h3>
<p>— Qiushui</p>
<p>This is a story written by a playwright: In Northeast China, in 1932, when Japanese armed immigrants arrived in a certain small town, they forcibly occupied the house of Ma Shun and Su Jia. They killed two people accused of being guerrillas, while constantly fearing attacks from the guerrillas. A man named Kuroda, the head of the immigration unit, once captured the guerrilla commander, Climbing Tiger Zhang Wenxi. He wanted Ma Shun to identify whether he was real or fake. Ma Shun took the opportunity to release Climbing Tiger. Consequently, a Korean man named Cui Daji was found guilty by Kuroda and shot dead.</p>
<p>The next day, the execution was scheduled for Ma Shun, Su Jia, and Cui Chengfu. At night, they set fire as a signal. The guerrillas stormed in and rescued them, but Cui Chengfu had already been shot dead by the Japanese.</p>
<p>The lives of the people in Lili Grass are one of suffering and oppression, but also of struggle. The lives of the people in Lili Grass are the real lives of our compatriots in Northeast China. Now that the Northeast has returned to our embrace, recalling the past is like waking from a nightmare. Indeed, it is still worth seeing how unfortunate our nation was in the past, how suffocated our people were, so that we can now cherish and strengthen ourselves.</p>
<p>Fengzi's Su Jia is a new woman. She is young, but the atmosphere seems to have aged her several years. Mu Hong's Ma Shun is passable. Qiao Qi's Kuroda portrays his cunning and insidiousness, and even his small movements are vividly depicted. In terms of acting, this is one of the most satisfying performances.</p>
<p>The actress playing "—Me—," Zai Yi, is said to be a "remarkable person." However, this newcomer reveals her rawness in her acting. She fails to demonstrate her ability and remarkable qualities. In the final scene, she directs what to do and how to do it, but her voice sounds almost like a broken record. However, judging from her efforts and seriousness, she might be a promising figure.</p>
<p>The first few scenes pass in a dull atmosphere, but there is a change at the beginning of the last scene. However, after the appearance of the thief, the atmosphere of the "civilized drama" is too strong. Although the intention is to change the atmosphere, this move may be a flaw.</p>
<h3>Hollywood Film Stars Return Home</h3>
<p>— Yingdai</p>
<p>Back on the Silver Screen to Start New Films</p>
<p>Most of the film personnel who joined the military have now been demobilized and have returned to the United States first, to resume their lives under the mercury lights of Hollywood. We can list a few below.</p>
<p>(1) Tyrone Power, 30 years old, served as a Navy lieutenant in the war against Japan and returned to Hollywood in early December. His wife, Annabella, was filming "Wings of the Morning." She welcomed him at the landing site in Pat Roland with an embrace and a passionate kiss, a scene rarely seen on screen.</p>
<p>(2) Clark Gable will be 45 years old on February 1st. He served as an Air Force colonel and was ordered to fly to Germany. He left the military in June 1944, having served for almost two years. He is filming "Adventure" with Greer Garson and Joan Blondell. The producer is Victor Fleming. He is now planning a car trip to Mexico to learn Spanish from Lina Román.</p>

Marlene Dietrich was commended by the Eastern Commander for her courage in serving despite her physical discomfort.</p>
<p>Film News Briefs</p>
<h3>"Boundless Prospects"</h3>
<p>"China Electric" (Zhongdian) is releasing the drama "Boundless Prospects," with the theme of overseas Chinese returning to participate in the war of resistance, at the Grand Theater in Shanghai on New Year's Day. The film is the only work during the war of resistance by the famous director Cai Chusheng, starring Miss Li Qingrong. It can be called a masterpiece produced in the rear and caused a sensation in Shanghai after its premiere.</p>
<h3>"Teacher of the Ages"</h3>
<p>The script of "Teacher of the Ages" by Yuan Junfu is said to be published by the Municipal Cultural Publishing House, and is now being printed. The play describes the story of professors in the rear sticking to their posts despite hardship. It will be performed by the "China Electric" troupe at the Lyceum Theater in Shanghai next spring. The main actors are Geng Zhen, Bai Yang, Yue Lu, Zhang Yan, Zheng Min, Shen Yang, Wu Yin, Liu Housheng, etc., still the old cast from Chongqing, the lineup is very neat.</p>
<h3>"Film" Magazine Published</h3>
<p>There are many film publications recently published in Shanghai, among which the "Film" picture magazine is the best. In addition to the cover being a seven-color rubber plate fine print of Shirley Temple, there is a five-color overleaf of Linda Darnell. The content mainly introduces Hollywood stars and is a large volume priced at only 300 yuan. It is said that all newsstands have it for sale.</p>
<h3>Random Thoughts</h3>
<p>— Moyan</p>
<p>There have been many reports and discussions about the issue of soldiers watching free plays for the past two weeks, and the incidents and disputes caused by them have also been dealt with by the military and political authorities in the city. Perhaps a solution will be formulated soon, but I am afraid that the "solution" may not be considered a resolution to the problem, because it includes several fundamental issues such as soldier's treatment, garrison jurisdiction, and theater ticket prices, which no one can immediately resolve completely. We only hope that the situation can gradually improve. Maybe in ten or twenty years, this problem will no longer exist. Speaking of this kind of problem and the Qing Xiong (brash behavior) it reveals, it is precisely to create a spiritual boundary between the military and civilians, and for the "military" to forever have an unpleasant "eye-catching" feeling. As for whether the incidents that occur in various theaters in Shanghai are detrimental to international perceptions, it goes without saying. Therefore, the theaters only suffer limited losses, and the ultimate responsibility still falls on our Republic of China?</p>

<h3>Municipal Suggestion: The Racecourse Should be Converted into a Sports Field</h3>
<p>— Luo Ziqiang</p>
<p>After the racecourse was taken over, it was sublet to the American military authorities. Is it because this large open space cannot be used?</p>
<p>Look at the Bund Park, which is crowded every morning with citizens who are striving for self-improvement, stretching their fists and legs. Shanghai has more than four million people who work in a crowded environment all day long, depriving them of outdoor activities, most of whom are physically weak and prone to illness.</p>
<p>The racecourse is located in the center of the city, with an open space and convenient transportation, making it very suitable to be developed into a public sports field, so that citizens can adjust their mental and physical fatigue and exercise their bodies. It is hoped that the authorities will take it back for their own use. After taking it back, the surroundings can be planted with flowers to isolate the noise. The outer ring can still be the race track, and another ring can be opened as a pedestrian path for citizens to run. The area in the middle of the field can be divided into several sections, with some sections being football fields, steel ball fields, basketball fields, and some sections being Tai Chi fields, wrestling fields, boxing fields, and other martial arts mechanical exercises, even somersaults, etc., hiring famous teachers to teach, in order to awaken the martial spirit of our compatriots and break free from the stigma of the "Sick Man of East Asia."</p>
<p>A strong country must first have strong people, and the wise authorities will surely have a high vision. Furthermore, the quality of our country's army is very weak, which may be due to the neglect of training on weekdays. Although the Japanese invaders have surrendered, the spirit of their daily training during their occupation is worthy of our military and political leaders to adopt this method, and it will surely have a great effect.</p>
<h3>Crack Down on Prostitution Solicitors and Streetwalkers: Do Not Neglect Small Matters</h3>
<p>It is reported that the Municipal Police Department will crack down on all escort agencies and massage parlors that are disguised brothels from New Year's Day, which is a wise move. From now on, many people can be rescued and spared from falling into the sea of ​​suffering again, which is really meritorious. However, there is still a very small matter that I hope the wise authorities will pay attention to, that is, in the area of ​​the Dashin Company gate on Nanjing Road, every afternoon, before two or three o'clock, there will be a group of streetwalkers who are considered to be the lowest, soliciting business there. Foreign soldiers are their target, and they do not hesitate to use any ugly state to curry favor. Because I often pass by there, I always see it, and I am often angry. I feel that we are now a first-class power, and in this so-called world metropolis of Shanghai, and especially in the most bustling area, there is such an embarrassing thing happening, which is detrimental to the image and is a great loss to national prestige.

<h3>A Message to the Guangdong Compatriots in Shanghai: Quickly Redress the Wrongful Conviction of Yang Wendao</h3>
<p>— Zhen Kai</p>
<p>We know that our country's judiciary is independent, but the handling of legal cases should never be stylized, like Yang Wendao, the "central figure in the shocking news of the international blood case" that once shocked the world. The Judicial Affairs Bureau seems to resolve the case as soon as possible. Moreover, Yang Wendao suffered severe torture, but he was still unwilling to be used by the enemy Japanese. Yang Wendao truly deserves to be a "hard man who would rather sacrifice his life than be used by the Japanese invaders." Just talking about the matter, after the unconditional surrender of the brutal Japanese and the victory of our War of Resistance, allowing Yang Wendao to be honorably released from prison and receive the support of the masses is not an extremely honorable thing?</p>
