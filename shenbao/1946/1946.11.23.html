<h3>憲草完成立法程序　呈送政府提交國大　立法院通過憲草修正案</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿二日電〕舉國注意之中華民國憲法草案修正案，廿二日晨經立院五委會聯席審查會議遵照中常會議決議案通過後，於午後二時半該院第四屆第四次臨時會議中一致無異議通過。開會多次辯論數日之憲草立法程序，遂告正式完成。該案廿三日可送國府再轉國大作爲制憲參考。立院今日全院會議，出席立委五十餘人，孫科主席，吳尚鷹報告上次會議議事錄及其他文件後，即開始討論憲草案。首由林彬報告五委會聯席會議審查中華民國憲法草案修正案經過對十三日十六日及今日之三次審查會議情形，與中常會補辦手續經過，報告甚詳。該案業經今晨聯席審查會議決遵照中常會決議案通過，提請大會公決。報告畢，吳雲鵬即起立發言，希望各民族應有之地位，在憲法中應有明文規定，俾予保障而符各民族一律平等之眞義，吳氏認院中對憲草若一字不改，即予通過，則最好能將此種意見附送國大。狄膺亦王將蒙古代表前次來立院請願時，所提請求由立院擬成書面意見，轉送國大。至此，各立委以該案業經審查會一字不改通過，本會中似不必再斤斤於內容之討論。陳紫楓建議將憲草案全案送交國大，由國大再作內容之修正。陳顧遠亦認對內容不必多談。乃由孫科以其低沉之語調，對審查經過作一總結，谷立委亦谷注意靜聽，會塲空氣益見肅穆。孫氏首指出國府二十五年五月五日朋令公佈之憲法草案，原名爲中華民國憲法草案，報章爲簡便將其省稱爲五五憲草，其實並非法定名稱，似應維持法定名稱爲宜，不應於括弧中加五五憲草修正案等字樣。關於吳雲鵬委員所提蒙旗問題，孫氏稱，憲草第五條「中華民國各民族一律平等」下，原遵照政協決議加「聚居於一定地方之少數民族，應保障其自治權」，其後總裁以大小民族待遇應一律平等，不應特別指出，故將此款删去。憲草國民大會章廿六條「國民大會以左列代表組織之」以下一二兩款，原爲：（一）由各省區及民族自治區直接選出之立法委員，（二）由各省凝會及民族自治區議會選出之監察委員。經研究後，以「民族自治區」一詞，過於空泛，嚴格而論，內地實亦爲「民族自治區」，同時該詞有一種解釋，爲指蒙藏而言，何不直接改爲蒙古各盟及西藏，故有目前之規定。孫氏繼稱，中常會四十六次會討論該案時，亦有新意見提出，亦有主張加以修改者，最後決定因該案尚將交付國大，當時乃不作條文之修正，原則通過交立院審議。中常會之意，亦認不必於一天半時間中作條文之修改，而盼不加修改通過全案，以完成法定程序，再由國府送交國大，再於國大中討論，各委員對憲　　草內容如有意見，若同時亦爲國大代表，盼於國大提出，如不爲國大代表，則可託國大代表，提出書面意見。國大中似有充分之時間，可供討論。語畢即將廿二日晨聯席審查會所作決議，提付表決，全塲立委一致口稱：「無異議」，「無異議」。此立法院有史以來最重要之議案，亦即我中國制憲史上關係最重大之「中華民國憲法草案修正案」，遂於一片「無異議」聲中通過。</p>

<h3>五委會聯席會　通過憲草經過</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿二日電〕中華民國憲法草案修正案，業經立院五委會聯席審查會於廿二日晨遵照中常會決議通過，送請該院全會會議公決。俟廿二日下午四時該院全院會議通過，立法程序即爲完成。聯席審查會係上午九時半開始，到立委五十餘人，林彬主席，首說明憲草審議會於十八，十九兩日開會經過，並指出開會時政府方面代表，對國大之組織與職權，立法與行政之關係，同意權問題與地方制度等，皆曾有意見提出，次說明憲草審議會對憲草所作之最後修正，與王寵惠等根據政協原則整理而成之訂正稿不同之點，其中最主要者爲增加第四十五條「總統對院與院間之爭執，除本憲法已有規定者外，得召集有關各院院長會商解決之」，此條五五憲草原有規定，今予恢復藉以增加各院間聯繫。另加第五十七條「行政院各部會首長及不管部會之政務委員，由行政院院長提請政府任命之」一條，此外較重要之更動爲中央與地方權限一章中，第一百十一條，改爲「左列事項由中央立法並執行，或交由省縣執行之」於訂正稿中「省」字下加一「縣」字，並增加第一款「省縣自治通則」，以彌補省權過大之弊。最後報告中常會第四十六次會討論該案時經過及院長對立院審議該案之希望，報告畢請各委員發表意見。狄膺首先起立，報告上次接見蒙古請願代表之經過，並詳細說明蒙古代表對憲法之希望。繼由各委員對修正案發表意見，劉不同等最爲激烈，主張不予討論，陳顧遠等主張「原則通過」對內容則一字不動，李元白認修正案有研討必要，應予修改，並主全體立委參加國大，於國大中討論。陳長蘅主張於決議案中加上「時間倉促不及爲內容之審議」等字樣，若干立委對「原則通過」四字認有問題，蓋如是立法院將負其責任。折中派提出一種新論詞，即「原則通過」，惟對文字加以斟酌。一部份立委對憲草名稱亦提供意見，主張於新名下加「五五憲草修正案草案」等字樣，以表示憲草係依五五憲草爲藍本而產生者。李慶麐，司徒德及譚惕吾，則就憲草內容提出修正意見，李氏說明各民族應做到眞正平等，建議於基本國策章除使耕者有其田外，對牧者供用土地之權亦應予以憲法上之保障，司徒德認憲草忽視土地問題，基本國策章涉及經濟制度部門應加修正。女立委譚惕吾以爲憲法對各民族及男女平等宜有切實規定。發言者卅餘人，會塲殊見熱鬧，孫九錄，陳顧遠等亦皆有聯名建議提出。最後由林彬綜合各方意見提付表決，以三十四票之多數通過　　如下之決議「中華民國憲法草案修正案擬遵照中常會決議案通過，提請大會（即立院全院會議）公決」。會議至十一時半許散。（按立院十一日曾開首次審查會，由孫院長簡略報告憲草修訂經過，十四日舉行五委會聯席會議，聽取王寵惠，吳經熊報告整理經過，因發生立法程序問題，當時未作討論，改於十五日舉行臨時座談會，十六日又開審查會，決定候中常會補辦手續後再議，至今日審查會如告通過，前後歷時逾一旬，開會達五次之多）。</p>

<h3>李璜患及腦病　正在滬療養</h3>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕自靑年黨中常委李璜氏，遵醫囑謝絕見客後，外間傳說紛紜，甚至有誤傳其失蹤者，記者昨赴林森路泰山公寓訪問爲李氏診病之吳天民醫師，以李氏病狀相詢，吳氏初不欲承認，繼乃笑謂記者曰：「幼椿（李璜字）爲我二十餘年之老友，目下彼患腦病，須絕對休養，雅不願外間人士此時擾其心情也。」記者堅請其允許見李一面，吳氏云：「余以醫生立塲，歉難照辦，但余可保證幼椿幷未失蹤，短期間可以恢復健康，待其能見客時，當爲先通知貴社也。」</p>
<h3>國大第一次大會　定後日上午舉行　主席團今討論議事規程</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿二日電〕國大第四次預備會，廿二日下午三時二十分舉行，蔣主席着軍便服，於開會前兩分鐘蒞臨，仍由孫科任主席，首由洪蘭友報告報到代表迄今日止計一五五七人，今日到會一五〇二人，已超法定人數，宣布開會，行禮如儀後，報告主席團選舉結果，仍由洪一一宣讀當選人姓名及票數，全體代表聞唱蔣主席名時，掌聲如雷，旋每唱一名，全體均鼓掌，繼報告吳貽芳·陳立夫·陳誠辭主席團主席職務。緻由洪氏再行唱名，當選人依次登台，主席居中，白崇禧·孫科分立左右，旋各主席均蒞台上，時已下午三時五十分，暫行休息，主席團當即在會堂內舉行第一次會議，決定大會秘長人選，四時十分預備會再開會，報告主席團會議結果，公推洪蘭友爲大會秘書長，陳啓天·雷震爲副秘長。大會廿三日休會一日，主席團第二次會議，定廿三日上午十時舉行，討論大會議事規程，廿四日星期日，廿五日上午九時舉行第一次大會。由蔣代表中正主席。</p>

<h3>政院組織法修正案　立法院審查通過　運輸部仍維持交通部原名</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿二日電〕政院組織法修正案，業經立院廿二日午後西屆四次臨時會照審查意見通過。該案與前日發表之修正草案其最大不同之點，爲原草案之運輸部又復改稱交通部。立院法制委員會委長林彬於報告審議該草案經過時，解釋稱，委員長交議案原文本爲運輸部，惟國府所發下之行政院組織法修正草案改爲「交通部」，並於其上蓋有印信，審查時以「交通」較運輸爲好，故維持舊有交通部之名稱。其他方面亦有若干更動，報告畢，衛挺生起草發言，主張取消行政院之會計長。林彬解釋政院設置會計長以來，已歷有年所，其事務亦極繁忙，似應先諮詢政院意見，本案似行暫予原案通過。關於應否設置會計長事，似應另案辦理。洪瑞釗對修正政院組織法增加部會一事，表示反對，渠認此次修正組織法固有其環境上之需要，而目前之陡增三四部會，實爲一種惡性膨脹，內政部本已無事可做，今竟將原屬該部業務改設衛生部，地政部，水利部。交部郵電司業務本極淸閑，今亦改司爲部，此種增加實未見其平衡財政。趙珮，簡貫三等則不以其意爲然，簡氏反對尤烈，最後鍾天心以其向有之冷靜頭腦發言，指出此次所增者，僅一郵電部，不能謂增加太多，進一步而論，即不由於情勢關係，水利地政及衛生改而爲部，亦有充分理由，蓋抗戰結束，建設肇始，上述三種業務，關係老百姓福利至鉅，即多費國帑，若能辦好亦非無好影響。最後提付表決，照審查意見通過。</p>

<h3>國大花絮録</h3>
<p>— 本報記者張明</p>
<p>今天記者們一進會塲，就接到請客帖，打開一看，原來是記者請記者，首都新聞記者公會請各地蒞京記者。</p>
<p>在主席團集合到台上去時，蔣主席是第一名，着軍便服，站立在台前最中央，臉上始終帶着微笑，這時水銀燈四射，光彩閃耀。</p>
<p>隨主席到台上去的，第二位是白祟禧，戎裝配備，還加上耀眼的勳章，水銀燈裏星光燦爛。</p>
<p>主席團裏兩位女的，但是吳貽芳辭謝了，所以只賸下劉蘅靜一個，排列在主席團的行列中，特別顯出小小巧巧的樣子。</p>
<p>因爲吳貽芳的辭謝主席團，又因爲主席宣布了邵力子遞補，女代表們有點小小騷動起來了，在休息時，大家東聚一堂，西聚一團，有的說女的辭，應該女的補，有的說怎麼能够由她私人辭職，就影響了我們女的呢？正在爭論不休，胡健中走過去，一面說，女代表們怎麼樣要暴動了？</p>
<p>唯一的女主席團女主席劉蘅靜走下台來，兩度被圍，首先是拍照，其次是簽名，記者再要求她說兩句話，她却說，「我只有一句話，主席團四十六個人當中，只有一個女的，太少了？」</p>
<p>邵力子被公布遞補主席團，但是他又堅辭了。主席團諸位先生站到台上去時，他在下面報告，表示堅決的辭意。並且以手指點點頭部，大概是說，『隨時都感到頭痛」的意思。都辭謝主席團，因爲他先前說過，一不做秘長，二不做主席團。</p>
<p>會塲的咳嗽聲甚多，此起彼落，大槪是氣溫變化所致。</p>
<p>中宣部彭部長進入會塲後，就坐在旁聽席的最後一個座位。</p>
<p>辭主席團主席職務的三位代表，都是浙江人，浙江代表吳望伋說：「我也不好意思說」。</p>
<p>吳貽芳辭主席團職務的原因，是校務煩忙，陳立夫據他自己說是「才短事煩」。邵力子却是「時感頭痛」。陳誠的辭意很堅決，谷正綱很想起立講幾句挽留的話，但陳誠却向他連連作揖，請他千萬不要說。</p>
<p>主席宣布了有人辭謝職務後，這三位乃至四位人物立時成了大家的目標，同時就在這片刻間，他們也就顯得相當活躍了。</p>
<p>廿二日會塲秩序很好，原因是並沒有討論事件，不値得爭吵。</p>

<h3>十位立委論修正憲草（一）</h3>
<p>— 本報記者俞振基</p>
<p>自王寵惠，吳經熊，雷震三氏，以五五憲草爲底本，根據政協原則及綜合會與憲草審議會修改原則，整理而成立「五五憲草修正草案訂正稿」公布後，各方咸極重視，所作評論亦不一致，甚至有認修改五五憲草即爲遠背三民主義，五權憲法精神者。立法院前開審查會談話會時，各立委亦會有激烈辯論，該訂正稿近又經憲草審議會之最後審議，其中五院間聯繫，政院及各部會首長之任命等項，會中咸有更進步之規定，並已經中常會第四十六次會議通過，送立院完成立法程序，再送國大作爲制憲之草案。該案立院二十二日晨舉行五委會聯席審查會時已遵照中常會決議予以通過。下午該院全院會議亦予通過，立法程序已告完成，即可轉送國大討論。</p>
<p>制憲爲此次國大之唯一任務，而該修正案又將爲制憲之底本，其在我國制憲史上之重要性，自不難想見，而各方對其批評，又如此其紛歧，記者爲此特走訪立法委員林彬，陳長蘅，張肇元，陳顧遠，李晨學，鍾天心，諶小岑，傳統先，趙酒傳，陳洪等，請就學理與國情，對修正案與原五五憲草作一客觀之比較，茲將各立委意見依訂正稿次序擇要綜述於后。（附記：大部份訪問工作，係憲草審議會十八，十九兩日開會前所進行者，關於審議會主要修改之點，請參閱二十日本報）：</p>
<p>中國爲何種共各國？</p>
<p>修正案將五五憲草總綱第一條「中華民國爲三民主義共和國」改爲「中華民國蓋於三民主義，爲民有民治民享之民主共和國」。此一則動議在立院曾引起軒然大波，狄膺即認林肯之民有民治民享三原則不報包括三民主義全體並認將外國敎條列入我國憲法，似有未妥。張肇元亦認有張冠李戴之嫌。陳顧遠認「民右民治民享」不即等於「民族民權民生一，然認比點並不過份重要。鍾天心則以爲如此規定，並不即表示與三民主義相違背，整二者本質上並無多大差具，其父本人亦曾謂，三民主義之目的，是在民有民治及民亭，惟從立法技術言，訂正稿似稍條緊唣。其他各委員對此咸不甚重視。</p>
<p>值得重視的領土問題</p>
<p>根據五五憲草規定，我國領土爲列舉性質，其變更須經國民大會之議決。訂正稿則由於當前局勢關係，對領土僅作概括之規定，其變更亦不必經國民大會之決議，依法律即可加以變更，多數委員對於此一規定咸認不妥。</p>
<p>李慶鏖即認：「依其固有之疆域」一語過於含糊，主張採用其他國家之辦法，用天文點規定經緯綫，此點若不能辦到，亦應用列舉方法。鍾天心之看法爲：訂正稿起草人必以爲立法委員旣將由人民選舉，由人民代表組成之立法院，對此問題當可加以處理，起草人又必認爲立法院旣有議決條約案之權，條約中難免不涉及領土，因之，於疆域一條中規定「非依法律不得變更之」，而不規定須國大決議</p>
<p>兩氏或認領土對國家關係至爲重要，僅依法律即得加以變更似嫌輕率，僉主應照五五憲草原規定，中華民國領土，非那國民大會議決，不得變更。惟陳顧遠氏則認列舉太硬性，目前之規定自有其苦心，概括較列舉爲</p>
<p>訂正稿第五條規定：「中華民國各民族，一律平等」，李慶鏖認此條雖如此規定，然實際朱做到，並舉基本國策掌爲例，該掌第一三六條規定：「國家應使耕者有其田，勞動者有其職業，企業者有發展之機會，以謀國計民生之均足」。就漢人而言，「耕者有其田」後，其民生即可獲得保障，然游牧者又如何？若因「耕者有其田」而侵及牧者之牧塲又如何？我國過去邊陲之種種問題，往往因耕者侵及牧者之牧塲而引起，旣稱各民族一律平等，對牧者以至於漁者應得之保，障何不列入憲法之中？就國家言，亦非所有之土地爲牧地，李氏主張將該條改爲「有使用土地能力者，保有其土地」，如是耕者，牧者，漁者皆獲得應得之保障，「各民族一律平等」一語，始可謂已眞正做到。</p>

<h3>日漁船擅越限區　在台灣北百餘里處發現　盼政府促麥帥總部注意</h3>
<p>〔本市訊〕據行總漁管處訊：上月廿五日合省北部約一百廿餘里處，（東經一二二度四七南緯廿二度四七）突發現日本手操網漁輸四艘，爲我漁船「傑充特勃愛」號現見，該日漁船中最西一艘船尾部份有「福田丸第八十六號」字樣，係下關船，殼綠色，艙板爲赤色，載有日籍衣陸軍舊制服之船員，經查明該船等係自長崎駛出，當時捕得鯛魚紅娘魚各一箱，查美佔領軍麥帥總部原限制日漁船在該國三十海里內准予捕魚，後寬放至九十海里，但現日漁船竟侵入離太國四百海里處，希我政府能加以注意，幷促使麥帥總部注意云。</p>
<h3>綏靖區政務會議決定　實行土地改革案　在收復區提倡合作運動</h3>
<p>〔合衆社南京廿二日電〕某高級官方人士今日吿合衆社記者云：政府爲處理收復區而舉行之綏靖區政務委員會會議，已於昨日閉幕。會中通過「更具革命性」之土地改革，以及有關救濟，敎育與經濟合作之種稱措置。官方人士並稱：會議中決定在准陰，淮安，泰興及泰縣設四個實騐區，遵照蔣主席在開會詞中指示各點，實行政府之新土地改革方案。綏靖區政務委員會會議係由宋院長與白部長主持，聞已着手草擬計劃。傳作義將軍昨日在會議中稱：共產黨不惟在軍事上失敗，且在政治與經濟方面亦已失敗，所餘者惟該黨之主義，但目下亦已開始動搖矣。渠謂：土地改革將分三個階段實施：（一）農民將繼續耕種共產黨所分予之土地，但所有權將歸還原主。此點對於不在當地之地主亦屬適用。先前規定歸還原地主之土地，僅以五十畝爲限，此項規則業已予以放棄，但若干政府官更仍堅持保留此一限制。官方人士並稱：此項問題將留父綏靖區政務委員會辦理。（二）政府將辦理土地登記。（三）政府將實行國父之土地政策，即提高賦稅，使不耕種之地主無利可圖，並協助農民購買土地。該方面人士並謂：宋院長已准許撥款九十萬萬元救濟收復區，但在綏靖區政務會議中，並未規定詳細計劃。業稱：此項問題將留待政府有關部門與各省當局決定。會議中決定在收復區提倡合作運動。此外，並決定行政院應儘速以一百萬萬元付予新成立之中央合作銀行。據稱：蔣主席前已允准以此款頂付予該銀行作爲流動資金，但截止目前，宋院長僅付出二十萬萬元。會議中並通過一決議，即着手修復一切被破壞之學校。對於新課程，並無特殊規定。</p>

<h3>中長路蘇籍員工　請求回國真象　均係患病或生計困迫者</h3>

<h3>社論　願國大制憲能見其大！</h3>
<p>國民大會自十五日開幕後，一週以來都在預備會議的過程中。現在主席團已經選定，憲法草案修正案也已經中國國民黨中常會鄭重通過，交由立法院完成程序，立法院昨天正在審查討論，不日當可完成其立法程序，可知國大自下星期始，勢將步入於正式開議之階段。</p>
<p>此次國大雖在千辛萬苦多災多難中產生，但就一週來的跡象推測，不能不承認它是養成中國一種新政風的搖籃。我們所謂新政風，就是彼此尊重，相互容讓的政風。我們堅决反對在戰塲上解決問題，而主張在議塲上決定一切。惟具如此，我們必得看見一個包容各種意見的議塲，而允其樂聞有一個對各種良好意見確能融會貫通，折衷至當，以定取舍的議場。此次國大，因中樞當局的高瞻遠矚，寬容忍讓，確已樹立了新政風的模楷。國民黨而外，先有靑年黨與社會賢達的參加，今後更有民社黨的參加，而全國人民與海外僑胞所選舉的大多數代表，不問其屬何黨籍或全無黨派，亦都不遠千里萬里，共聚一堂，這已經是難能可貴。中共和民盟目前雖還未表示參加，但國大不但仍保留其代表名額，昨且保留其參加主席團之名額，可知國大全體代表無不竭誠希望此一大會爲反映全國各種意見的大會，這尤其是良好政風的極度表現。加以國大會外，國民黨中央常會和國防最高委員會，最近更通過國府組織法和行政院組織法的修正案，充分表現遵守政協決議的精神，國民黨以一個執政的黨而有此「天下爲公」的大度，眞是中華民國走上民主大道的最有力的保證；只要參加各方都能發揚「天下爲公」的新政風，我們相信制憲事業一定可有美滿的收穫。</p>
<p>說到制憲，我們只有籲請國大代表，放寬心胸，能見其大。憲法是國家根本大法，制憲是國民最大任務。大事業當然需要大手筆。以二千人的大會，代表全國的各宗族，各地區，各職業，各黨派，各階層，若代表們沒有注視整個國家的大眼光，沒有包容整個民放的大心胸，爲全體的利益打算，爲後世的子孫打算，而祇是顧到局部，想到小我，條文枝節，爭執不休，則依過去一週間預備會議情况來測度，恐怕一百四五十條約條文，一年半載也未必能議得完整無缺。這次非今天國民所期望。我們並不是說國大代表儘可草率從事，但我們必須堅請國大代表從大處落墨。</p>
<p>民主政治雖本來似乎是浪費時間的政治，但我們總得期望在民主政治的學習過程中，使時間不致於過度浪費！民主政治固然是歡迎辯論的政治，但我們必須使大家在學習民主政治的過程中，切實在議事規則所許可的範圍內，針對本題來辯論，而减少文不對題的對些枝葉之爭議。國大代表大都來自民間，各有職業，其屬黨政當局，更負中樞與地方的政軍重責，假使在國大會堂，曠日持久，辯難不休，試問政治所受影響如何？人民所寄的觀感如何？我們切望這次國民大會，代表諸公能見其大，在憲法的重大關鍵所在，即是政治經濟制度的精華所在，大家不放鬆的認眞討論，以期得到折衷一致的結論，爲國家立長治久安之本，而在條文方面，讓長於立法技術的專家們多負審查整理之責。允其是細節小事，我們根本不主張在憲法內去作繁瑣的規定。諸公須知：民主只要人民真正能「作主」，憲政只要政府實在能「行憲」，憲法原不過是全國上下人民與政府共守共行的大經大法而已，與其繁瑣莫辦，窒碍難行，何如此時先擇其犖犖大端，鄭重規定。使憲法上的一字一句，沒有一個人不願由衷的遵守奉行之爲愈。</p>
<p>那末，什麼是憲法上的大問題呢？國大代表必能見到，無煩多說，此時我們願先提供一點，就是政府權力的大小問題而已。國父孫中山先生早已說過，我們要使「人民有權，政府有能」，他又說西洋民主國家一方面希望政府萬能而另一方面又怕政府萬能，他有鑒於此，乃創爲五權憲法，其眞正的精義，尙不在於五權的分立，而實在於「政權」與「治權」的制衡。換言之，他是主張人民只有選舉罷免創制複决的四大政權，就可以控制政府的「人」與「法」，而政府旣被選任事以後，就當讓政府充分發揮其五種「治權」的「能」，以爲人民造福。「人」有不可者「罷免」之，「法」有不良者「複决」之，人民有此大權足矣，正不必選舉代表天天以掣政府之肘，使其動彈不得，而引爲快事。這是中山先生畢生精研各國典章制度的大發明，五權憲法眞正精義之所在！若遺忘此點，而僅步他人之後塵，只在牽制行政機構一點着眼，無論內閣制也罷，總統制也罷，時流所謂變相的內閣制也罷，變相的總統制也罷，不管換什麼花樣，披什麼外套，都將與　中山先生的遺敎有所出入。英美是民主先進國家，人民習於民治，國力早已充沛，而政制建立，歷史悠久，不論憲法爲成文或不成文，運用自如，已收大效，政府動作遲緩，猶無大碍。但後起之國，廣土衆民，積習相沿，又待變革，如今日的中國，處於風雲萬變之世界，如何急起直追，積極建國，當然不妨借助他山之石，而究竟不能全襲英美的成規。我們願大家平心靜氣，環顧世界，針對現實，爲中華民國制訂一部比較適宜可行的憲法。</p>
<p>最後，我們要請國大代表在制憲時，尤其必須時時想到這部憲法如何可以行得通，如何可以使人人願意奉行，萬萬不可在制憲之始就有一個制了再說，行不通再改的想法。天下事要成功，只有靠一個「誠」字！「誠者，物之終始；不誠無物。」國大制憲，就必須求其切實能行；這是誠，這是制憲成功的惟一要訣！</p>

<h3>壽縣命案情節驚人　縣長謀殺退職軍官　各方控告後張作六已拘押</h3>
<p>〔本報蚌埠訊〕皖北最近發生一縣長狹嫌栽誣，設計擅殺一無辜之退職軍官事件。死者爲趙子盤，在民國十六七年間，曾追隨三十三軍柏文蔚軍長任營團長等職，抗戰時亦曾率兵擊敵。此驚人慘案發生後，不但激起淮上人士之公憤，此間興論亦大爲譁然，咸以官吏如此草菅人命，責屬目無法紀，人權太無保障，茲就調查所獲，誌之如次：緣壽縣縣長張作六，皖北鳳台人，廣州中山大學畢業，曾在淮創辦淮民導報。抗戰期間，趙子盤任皖北行營第十二游擊縱隊第一大隊隊長，及第八挺進縱隊大除長支隊附等職。張作六在後方曾以大量物資，擬運至淪陷區蚌埠一帶銷售，經過趙子盤防區時，趙恐其資敵，阻之，張以物資不得通過，懷恨於心。</p>
<p>挾嫌誣告</p>
<p>勝利後，張獲任深。上月乃揑造趙子盤勾通匪徒，朦報第八綏靖區司令部請予拘捕，解蚌訊辦，竟如願以償。十月三十日午後二時，趙子盤在壽縣城內公園路某浴室沐浴，張作六偵悉，突派武裝士兵多人，將趙逮捕，鐐禁縣府內，不准通問。壽縣各機關法團人士聞訊，甚爲駭異，當聯名證明趙無違法行爲，並推派代表面懇釋放。張言奉第八綏靖區司令部命令拘捕解蚌，拒絕保釋。</p>

<p>十一月一日下午五時，全城戒嚴，張作六一面派武裝士兵八名，荷二長槍，持六短槍，將趙子盤由縣府後門帶出，趙於鄕鐺聲中，被押至北門上船，一面另派武裝土兵一隊，由東門乘船會合，將趙押解來蚌。詎行至平山頭鴨背舖以西，（鳳台縣境距壽縣二十里）竟於昏晚中，由士兵將趙開槍擊死，身中七彈，胸部受刀傷一處，厥狀甚慘，翌晨（二日）解案人仍由田家菴僱民船，將趙屍運至蚌埠，報吿綏靖司令部，詐謂途中遭遇刦匪，互相開槍，致趙受傷斃，並請檢騐，騐畢攝影。死者之子趙明亮女趙明英聞訊趕至，遂購置棺材，草草成殮。</p>
<p>各方呼籲</p>
<p>趙明亮兄妹以老父無端被殺，奇寃莫明，悲痛異常，當向旅蚌壽縣同鄉人士呼籲接助伸寃。壽縣旅蚌士紳劉華軒，於七日晚邀集同鄉，在壽，定，鳳同鄉會開緊急會議，出席者無不憤慨，當推劉華軒，彭琢如，胡錫疇，岳相如，朱卓人於八日上午至綏靖司令部，晋謁司令官夏威，報吿趙案眞相及經過情形，夏司令官甚感驚異，允派員偵查。旋壽縣參議會議長孫勤剛由壽逕赴合肥，向省府報吿，請予澈查，三民主義靑年團壽縣分團主任張睛川，亦赴京呼籲，死者之女趙明英，於十日由蚌赴合肥，向省府李主席訴陳寃苦，壽定鳳族蚌同鄕會並亦推派代表前往。</p>
<p>手令扣押</p>
<p>皖主席李品仙據報後，以張草菅人命，極爲震怒，當手令第一區專員公署，將張扣押解省嚴辦，專署奉令，立將張作六扣押，十八日已押解赴合肥，送省政府究辦矣。</p>

<h3>太湖清剿檢討　股匪翦除治安可期</h3>
<p>〔本報蘇州十二日電〕江南地區第二期淸剿計劃，自十一月一日開始實施以來，瞬刹即屆十一月底之完成期限。太湖淸剿指揮部特就兩月來之工作情况，於廿二日接見本報記者，發表談話，茲簡誌如次：太湖三萬六千頃，環跨江浙兩省，島嶼錯綜，自遜淸以還，垂五十餘年，素爲匪徒出沒淵藪，勝利以後，湯恩伯將軍鑒於太湖匪勢猖獗，實爲江南治安心腹之患，故特命傳錦方劉宏德兩氏，組織太湖地區淸剿指揮部於木瀆，自九月中句展開工作，本政府寬大爲懷不咎旣往之旨，首先飭令專員金家讓楊彥斌分別進行招撫工作，統計自十月至今，歸誠股匪有素據太湖之廖炳南浦福林部，流擾蘇南路北地區之毛雲祥曾俊峯部，竊竄錫南地區之顧福興部，及活動於濱湖農村之徐錦堂部，總數約有千餘名，携歸武器的機槍十餘挺，步槍三百餘枝，短槍百集餘枝，該批自新人員，均正待命編訓中。至於頑抗之股匪如李德孚，惠浴生，劉森林等，俱已殲滅，現太湖地區殘存之股匪，使剩薛永輝，周志敏，秦大剛三部，仍流擾於陽山地區之白馬瀾西津橋一帶，惟據確實情報，該三匪部所擁實力，僅輕機一挺，步槍十餘枝，故匪勢孤單，不難一鼓而殲，今後太湖治安確保可期，濱湖農民固可安枕，即商賈行旅亦可無所畏懼矣。</p>

<h3>京滬鐵路在改善中</h3>
<p>本報前由陳栗六君寄投『再向路局貢獻五點」一文，在本欄刋出後，頃得京滬區鐵路管理局面復：「（一）查本路行車班次，已較戰前爲多，而旅客人數，則超過戰前一倍以上，故除對號入座外，其他各列車乘客極形機擠，四等客車內乘客允多。關於座位，當設法改善。至旅客携帶商貨，本路限制極嚴，大件者照章須起包裹票，由包裹車運送，小件包裹，亦須自購帶包裹票携帶上車。至携帶鷄鴨魚蟹上車一節，本路現正擬訂妥善辦法以資取締。（二）查本路特別快車之延誤，初接收時，平均每次爲三小時又廿三分，最近平均每次僅爲九分鐘，經年餘之努力，已大見改善，至其他普通客車之延誤，因素頗多，亦正在澈底研究改善中。（三）本路每次加開旅客列車班次，均依據每月各區間旅客人數統計數字參考辦理，故無不切實際之弊。關於恢復戰前之京錫區間車一節，本路早省此意，惟查目前京錫間之旅客擁擠程度，遠不及其他各區間爲甚，故只能待車輛充裕時再行辦理。（四）本路各站戰前原均有候車室之設備，戰後多被毀。現本路爲减少旅客痛苦起見，正計劃先就各大客運站如南京·鎭江·常州·無錫·蘇州·上海·嘉興·杭州等站分別添設候車室，並充實其他設備。（五）本路因車輛缺乏，貨車班决，原已甚少。際此商業復甦之時，各部商貨待運亦亟，本路職可運輸，自應力謀疏通，以裕民生。原函建設减少貨車班次，改行客車一節，未免有顧此失彼之弊。恐又將引起另一方面人士之責難。」特予刋出，以誌路局從善如流之意。</p>

<h3>浙省縣長考試外記</h3>
<p>— 本報記者黃行天</p>
<p>浙江省的縣長考試，自民國二十年後，已十五年未曾舉行了。沈主席到任後，即決定舉行一次，初定七月，繼改十月，後來又改到十一月，而報名者仍不踴躍，這次實到應試的僅七十三人。他們底資歷可分：（一）高考及格者，（二）浙省歷屆特考及格者，（三）浙省自治學校及財務養成所畢業者，（四）中央政治學校畢業者。若論經歷，則有專員公署及縣府秘書，科長，區長，律師，法官，銀行職員等，有的還是辦過兵站的及軍中政治工作人員。</p>
<p>考試分口試筆試二種，筆試共爲三日。國文由浙省通志館館長余紹宋命題，出在周禮，考生中知道「廉善，廉能，廉正，廉法，廉敬，廉事」等六廉者，竟絕無僅有。其餘科目，試題均不甚難，祇要國文通順，常識豐富，總不會繳白卷。口試一關，則更重要。民廳阮廳長毅成在京出席國民大會，特飛滬回杭辦理此事。口試時全體典試委員分爲政治，經濟，法律三組，每組輪流一人發言，但全體委員個別記分。因每位委員的問題不同，應考人不免要靠幾分運氣。余老先生對糧政稅務人員的風氣多有牢騷，所以見到曾任或現任財糧的應考人，便先訓示一番。陳應長寳麟不忘財政，所問的都是縣長到任，縣庫空虛，縣參議會不許增加人民負担，而公敎人負請願加薪，應如何辦理？這些問題正是陳廳長自已目前所遭遇到的困難，故不恥，下問也。阮應長對政洽法律之學，均造詣甚深，且任職十年，經驗豐富，所以他問的問題，都鞭辟入裏，使各應考人不能用空言搪塞。而且他所發的問題，都非常注意用語與邏輯，答話的人，一不小心，就被他捉到破綻。</p>
<p>各位典試委員對應考人的答復是否滿意，原則上是當塲不可表示態度。但遇到答案太奇妙的時候，也不免互相微笑。如陳廳長向某應考人問什麼是規費，什慶是特賦的時候，那位未來的父母官就很直率地答道：「我沒有吃過財政飯，不知道。」有些應考人緊張過度，囁嚅不能盡其辭。也有的侃侃而談，如在法庭上舉證，或是在議會中說明提案理由。大多數應考人知道沈主席有一耳不靈，都說得很嚮；又都知道沈主席反對攤派苛雜，注重農田水利，所以對這二個問題都有一套擁護的理論。</p>
<p>口試於二十日午刻完畢，下午由各典試委員評閱筆試墨卷。因爲急待出榜，他們都閱到半夜方始出闈。聽設有一本卷上寫着：日後縣長即使民選，也要考試及格了才有被選資格，眞可謂目光遠大。但是考試院分發浙江的第一批大挑縣長尙有二人未派縣缺，第二批十五人又已來杭報到。另外還有縣長檢定，就在本月廿二三舉行。而省黨部奉令裁員，張主任委員也希望省府能在縣政方面容納一部份裁下的人員，所以應考人都在担另一種心思，就是省政府不會錄取得太多，一般的看法最多只會取十名。好在應考人大多數現在都有工作，不取也一樣有事做。如果取了呢，便得入省訓練團的縣政研究班，還要研究一下，也不能就走馬上任。</p>

<h3>英美减少特港駐軍　四外長可獲致協議　法要求延期討論德國問題</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山廿</p>
<p>二日廣播：特港問題，現已有獲致協議之可能，蘇方要求英美軍隊限期撤出特港，貝爾納斯已提折衰方案，表示英美願减少特港駐軍至某一限度，莫洛托夫對此頗有接受可能。</p>
<p>〔本報駐美特派員華盛頓廿二日專電〕因特港問題陷於僵局之四外長會議，對五附　國和約已無法完成，美國務卿貝爾納斯今日移轉目標，建議避重就輕，先行開始討論對德和約，然從再論及對日和的。此次外長會議之召集與聯大全會日期衝突，甚爲不妙，四强原定今日與中國代表會晤，討論否決權問題，但莫洛托夫因須參加討論駐軍問題之聯大會議，而藉詞拒絕出席五外長會議。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎廿二日電〕頃據負責方面消息法政府已訓令現在紐約之外次繆維爾，着其要求四外長會議在明年一月中旬以前，勿討論德國問題。按法國於上月間通吿三外長，謂法國一日爲臨時政府執政，即一日不能澈底討論此一問題，故法代表提議延至明年一月討論。彼時法國政治機構殆可較爲淸明。同時法代表將要求紐約四外長會議關於德國之任何討論，應以程序問題爲限。</p>
<h3>南非聯邦歧視印橋　顧維鈞加以譴責　爲印度控訴案作聲援</h3>
<p>斯末資竟以退出聯合國相威脅</p>
<p>〔本報紐約特派員廿一日電〕聯合國政治與法理委會今日開會，我代表團長顧維鈞博士發表演說，支持印度反對南非聯邦推行種族歧視政策。白俄羅斯·烏克蘭。南斯拉夫與危地馬拉亦主張將此項問題，予以充份討論，而由政治安全與司法事務兩委會聯合予以辦理。今晨南非總理斯末資將軍曾提出警吿，聲稱如國際機構採取反對種族歧視之任何行動，南非聯邦可能退出聯合國。其後印度代表班油特夫人即發表動人之呼籲，主張對南非聯邦採取行動。顧氏謂：南非法律有關印度人之部份，係根據種族歧視之原則，確屬事實，斯末資將軍亦不否認此點。然此一問題並非某一國家單純之法律問題，而牽涉世界之政治動態。由於南非與印度間對於此項問題之爭執，兩國關係已相當「緊張」，故應運用聯合國憲章之原則以處理之。顧氏並云，在過去三年中，中國曾屢决與南非政府保持接觸，以謀取消該國對中國人之歧視。斯末資稱爲內政問題，殊爲不合。史氏之自由進步思想，爲世人所欽敬，理當協助解決此事云。蘇聯代表葛羅米柯稱，本國政府尙未決定立塲，英代表亦然。</p>
<p>〔路透社紐約成功湖廿一日電〕南非總理斯末資在政治與法理委會中，表示同意討論印度之申訴南非歧視印人案，惟同時則覺討論時不可牽涉聯合國干涉內政之權。渠謂南非印人之地位，實毋需聯合國機構採取行動，聯合國憲章第二條，即明文規定聯合國機構不得千涉會員國內政範圍以內之事務，每一國家在不損他國權利之原則下，得以制定其本國之生活狀况，對其國界內之人及物，均有管轄之權。爲避免引起嚴重後果計，似宜中國際法庭對憲章第二條加以解釋，而不可遽由聯合國機構調查，以免造成干涉內政之惡例。</p>
<h3>英首相宣布　海陸空軍額</h3>

<p>腿部被槍擊受傷</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社紐約廿二日電〕聯大會烏克蘭代表史泰尼克，今日在紐約某小餐館中與同伴用膳，突有暴徒衝人店內行刦，史氏被槍擊，腿部受傷。據烏克蘭代表團長曼紐斯基稱，此種盜刦具有政治性質，渠常進行調查，而經由適當途徑提出報吿。美代表團長奧斯汀已向曼紐斯基表示歉意。</p>
<h3>調查駐軍問題引起激辯　各國間意見分歧　獲致妥協需幕後折衝　我代表贊成美修正案</h3>
<p>〔中央社紐約廿一日電〕由於各大國間之不同立塲，棘手之聯合國會員國在非敵國領土駐軍問題如欲獲致折衷協議，則幕後折衝似　必嚮者。五强雖一致在原則上同意蘇聯建議，但對如何實行則意見分歧。蘇聯主席僅需調查駐國外領土之軍隊情形，美國認爲調查必須包括國內軍隊之情形。我國表示倘美國果正式提出該修正建議時，我國願予支持。法國建議三點：（一）普遍調查武裝部隊，（二）駐外軍隊之比例减少，（三）若干戰略據點最後交由安理會處理。英國認爲一眞正問題」即爲裁軍問題，而非獲致軍隊情形問題，故主將蘇聯之調查駐軍及裁軍二項建議合併考慮。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社紐約成功湖廿一日電〕聯大政治及安全委會本日繼續開會，討論各國駐在國外之軍隊問題，首由中國代表顧維鈞發表演說稱，蘇聯所提出之調查計劃，業經美國加以修正，中國準備予以接受。中國駐在緬甸及越南之軍隊早已撤退返國，以言美國留駐中國之軍隊，爲數實屬有限，且曾得中國政府之同意，此其目的，乃在與中國合作，以完成關於遣送日本僑俘及解除日軍武裝之若干義務。此種美軍並未千涉中國內政，其留駐中國境內，旣未使巾美兩國間發生誤會或摩擦，亦未使美軍與中國人民發生誤會或摩擦。抑且美國駐軍員額業已逐步滅少，吾人深知一俟中美兩國所同意之任務完成之後，目下仍留駐中國美軍即可於適當期內完全撤退返美。至以蘇聯所提出之調查各國駐在國外之軍隊一項計劃，中國政府已準備予以接受，其理由有二：即（一）依照聯合國憲章第四十三條規定，聯合國各會員國應供給所必需之軍隊，組織國際軍隊，以維持國際和平及安全，故吾人欲實施此項條殼，則各國提供情報實屬必要。（二）蘇聯所提出之建議，如能山美國所提出之修正案加以補充，則對於研究裁滅軍備之問題，必有莫大之便利。職是之故，中國代表團願支持美國所提出之修正案，即聯合國各　　國對於其軍隊所提供之情報，應同時包括其國內軍隊及駐在國外之軍隊。</p>
<p>〔路透社成功湖二十一日電〕貝文外相今日在政治委會辯論蘇聯要求調查國外駐軍之建議時，聲稱，英政府之接受蘇聯此項建議，須以該項建議與裁軍問題有關爲限。貝文表示若將此兩事相提並論，則渠始願支持，在未能確定新機構是否有效前，英國不能採取可能若使其國民處入危境之行動。貝文復表示，英國完全贊成莫洛托夫之裁軍建議，渠要求政治委會以今軍事參謀部供給安理會以建立裁軍之機構，使各國政府得以知悉是否可將彼等一大部份之主權，讓與聯合國機構。貝文發言之先，莫洛托夫曾答英代表賈德幹昨日所提之問題，謂調查團外駐軍之目的，在便於準備關於供聯合國機構調遣之軍隊之協定。</p>
<h3>吉田內閣　態度堅定</h3>
<p>認不應急切解散議會</p>
<p>〔本報東京特派員廿一日電〕反對黨雖發動猛烈之政治攻勢，吉田內閣仍保持其原有地位，兀然不動。但本月廿五日召開非常議會時，日本政局將捲入洶湧之漩渦。議會閉會以後之日本政策，早已引起國民之注意。白政府宣佈其六項基本政策，同時反對黨尤其社會黨肆意抨擊後，此項政策似已聳動世人耳目。政治觀察家認爲一政府之六項基本政策及其具體辦法毫無新奇見解，不過爲陳腐之老生常談而已。吉田首相及其閣員能否保持其現有地位，全繫於政府各黨派之支持與團結。社會黨過去因內部情形複雜，態度向來曖昧，但其最近行動證明該黨顯已大爲進步。政府之意見認爲新憲法雖已於十一月三日公佈，但須六個月以後方始生效，且有關憲法施行之大批提案將提出下决非常及尋常議會討論。因此政府相信苟急切解散議會，必致發生一二月之政治脫節，而使憲法不能付諸實施。職是之故，反對黨雖猛烈抨擊，政府態度始終堅定，迄無動搖之徵象。</p>

<h3>美煤礦工總罷工　聯邦法庭控告魯易斯　杜魯門銷假返華府親自處理工潮</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山廿二日廣播：社魯門總統今日結束其假期，定明日飛返華盛頓，親自處理工潮問題。</p>
<p>〔聯合社紐約廿一日電〕美國煤礦總罷工今日已開始，僅少數不屬工會煤礦未波及。政府律師已擬就蔑視法令之訴狀，控吿礦工聯會主席魯易斯，不挽救四十萬礦工風潮。各州煤礦逐一報吿已完全罷工。各州煙煤礦平時每日產煤二百廿萬噸，今日顯然全部停頓，明日亦無希望。</p>
<p>四十萬礦工</p>
<p>現留居家中</p>
<p>各州礦塲則懸掛美國國旗，臨風招展，象徵聯邦政府已實行接收，但未發生意外。罷工風潮甚至波及賓夕法尼亞州之白煤礦，該處八大煤礦工人七千五百名亦已罷工。此次大罷工爲美國經濟之重大威脅。烟煤供給全國百分之九十五之機關車軍動力，百分之五十五之工業原動力，及百分之六十二之發電力。罷工倘嚝日持久，將使二千五百萬左右之工人賦閒無事，因煤斤缺乏足以迫使全國工廠等關門。工業雜誌「鐵時代」稱：罷工將强迫鋼鐵業减低生產至百分之八十上星期則爲百分之九十一·五。鋼鐵之缺乏則將使數千製造廠關閉。共和鋼鐵廠今日實布减低生產至百分之六十五，等於每月减少鋼鐵出產十五萬噸。</p>
<p>〔路透社紐約廿二日電〕昨下午美五州產煤區之烟煤礦工，幾全部意工。美國最大之產煤州西弗吉尼亞之烟煤礦工十萬零二千名，賓夕法尼亞州之烟煤礦工十萬名，及俄亥俄，伊列諾，曼利蘭之烟礦工，均已實行停工。就全國各礦之報吿觀，四十萬工人幾已全部怠工，美　權威方面相信：煤礦工潮，對美國內陸運輸　有影響，而對世界之糧食狀况，　爲一最重要之大打擊。</p>
<p>美碼頭工人</p>
<p>仍未能復工</p>
<p>〔聯合社舊金山廿一日電〕美國工業組織聯合會所屬碼頭工人罷工問題雖吿解決，但今日仍未能至碼頭復工，以美國勞工聯合會所屬之船長，船副及領港工會主張延長罷工，在碼頭佈置糾察隊，阻止碼頭工人恢復工作。該會將於今明兩日表決與太平洋美國船主協會擬訂合同中之各項條件。船長，船副及領港工會與船主方面之合同條件未獲解決前，太平洋沿岸將仍被封鎖，即使合同條件經工會通過，在下星期一前，航運恐不能恢復正常狀態。</p>

<p>〔路透社倫敦廿一日電〕英外部所獲之初期報吿，顯示上週一之羅馬尼亞普選確有重大之不正常現象，如：（一）羅京及各省之許多投票站，均不許反對黨代表入內，（二）反對黨候選人有數人被捕，（三）有許多人具有一張以上之選票，（四）選票中有在分發以前即已塡名者，（五）恐嚇脅迫等情屢見不鮮。聞羅京美軍事使命團辦事處前，曾有大批民衆未感抗議彼等之未曾獲得選舉票。</p>

<h3>八百歲巨蟒　坦克也不怕　滇緬途中驚人故事</h3>
<p>路透社新加坡廿二日電〕此間華文報紙首决揭載卡車隊在滇緬路上遭遇巨蟒之驚人故事。據云：有滿載物資之軍用卡車一輛，自緬甸駛往雲南途中，司機忽覺其車爲物所阻，乃下車調查，則見有巨蟒一條，橫亙途中，身體半陷泥中，其體極長，故頭尾均不可見。時整個卡車隊均已抵達，乃相率下車，並以十七噸坦克車一輛自其身上輾過，不料該蟒仍若無其事，僅略事轉動而已。若干美靑年軍官爲好奇心所驅，乃沿該蟒之身前進，往搜索其首何在。行數百步，入森林，始見一龐然巨首，擱於岩石之上，似正假寐一軍官乃攀登樹頂，擬用其最近代化之自動步槍射擊，不料巨蟒適於是時睡醒，昂首直抵距樹僅數碼之處，該軍官驚悸之下，竟墮落巨蟒之口而不見。美軍司令部得訊後，乃派轟炸機前往，向該蟒投炸彈十餘枚，始將其炸斃。經剝去其皮後，發現腹內有鋼盔十餘頂，及手槍步槍等，後經動物學家估計，該蟒年齡，當在八百年以上云。</p>
<p>（編者按：此一故事，遠在抗戰勝利之前，滇中即已有所傳說。）</p>

<h3>走私嫌疑之聯總職員　未遭扣押　離滬赴菲</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕聯總西籍職員開依，曾於月初以有走私嫌疑，被警局枸解地檢處，地院因我國與聯總訂立之基本協定，對聯總職員犯罪另有規定，故曾呈請司法行政部請予解釋，業由司法行政部指示，謂聯總職員犯罪，除係由於職務上之行爲外，不能享受治外法權，已刋昨日本報。開依之來踪去跡，遂益受人注意。茲據聯總方面消息，開依現在馬尼拉，而彼於離滬之前，實始終未爲我國常局扣押。</p>

<h3>好萊塢製片商　有意在滬設廠　就地配製國音改善中文字幕</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據本市電影院商業同業公會理事長梁其田氏告記者稱，好萊塢電影製片商，有意於上海設廠，從事好萊塢影片華語對白配音及華文字幕工作。蓋美國影片商對國外市塲皆極重視，其推席國外市塲方法有二。一爲推銷十六米厘影片，因此種影片成本輕，份量輕，可郵寄，且不怕火燒，易於在小城市開映。次爲增配放映中國語言之對白，以獲取大量不懂英語對白之觀衆。</p>
<p>好萊塢影片之加華文字幕者，已極多，唯於好萊塢工作之國人，對國內情形不熟悉，致未能充份適合國內需要。例如「泰羅飽華」已爲上海人熟知之大明星，但彼蜚　成「太倫寳爾」四字，則無人知道。各公司過去在山國所化之宣傳費頗大，爲使此批宣傳費不致全功盡棄，有在中國設廠之必要。至於華語對白，華語說明，亦應適合國人之習慣，始不致鬧笑話。</p>
<p>「泰山到紐約」係第一部添加華語說明之影片。此片多屬動作，少劇情。米高梅公司更將選一部注重劇情之影片，加配華語說明，以視其效果如何。「泰山到紐約」成效較差，係上海觀衆懂英語者多之故。內地城市，華語對白之美片必受歡迎。將來之趨勢，可能在上海同時放映兩種拷貝之影片，一種係全部華語對白，一種係全部英語對白。在內地城市則放映前一種。</p>
<p>梁氏並告記者稱，本市電影觀衆已較戰前增加。同時從觀衆身份分析，得知本市巾下階級人仕之收入，已較戰前增加，故有餘資往觀電影。至於國產電影極有前途，但各製片公司需有計劃，生產多。否則一年半載拍一部影片，電影院商排片殊多困難。</p>

<h3>一羣水老鼠陸地大遊行</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕今晨十時，警察局將有又一「豪舉」，使全上海的市民爲之轟動。</p>
<p>上海一向摸竊之風盛行，結果警察局就來了一次摸竊大遊行；前一陣大家說水上治安實在太壞，「水老鼠」偷貨色的神通早已膾炙人口，於是今天就有一百幾十個「水老鼠」，在警探嚴密監押之下，又是遊行一番，浩浩蕩蕩的送到地檢處去。</p>
<p>據說這一百多人犯之中，有四個木領特別高强，能偸白糖兩袋，潛伏水中，然後伺機脫身。往往貨物結關的手續還未辦好，市而上早有出售，也就是這些「水老鼠」們玩的花樣。至於偸盜倉庫，授受贓物，更是五花八門，無奇不有。</p>
<p>警探們要逮捕「水老鼠」也大不容易。因爲他們實在精通水性，所以警探們祗要一不小心，往往就會被他們連人帶槍，拖到水底裏去。這次先後捉到一百多個，實在是十幾火來費盡心機的成績。</p>
<p>今天的遊行將經過福州路·跑馬廳路·呂宋路·林森中路·思南路，一直到地檢處。下午四時，警察局並將招待記者，報告「水老鼠」活動情形。同時，水上警察局現已得到查緝艇兩艘，其中之一已於昨晨一開始巡弋浦江；另一艘則尚待修繕。水警局並將組織水上義務警察總隊，有總統。威利韓等輪船公司參加，隊員已逾三百人，下月中可以正式成立。顯然「水老鼠」已面臨末日了。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕黃浦警分局奉令肅淸碼頭竊犯，由杜分局長令飭股員楊機行，朱德標，警長孫數長等不分晝夜嚴緝，在新開河，太古，新關，北京路等處碼頭，先後逮捕竊盜犯計陳阿毛，陳財寳等十七名均係要犯。偵訊屬實，總局諭令於今晨九時前，一併申解總局刑事警察處彙齊後，結隊遊行示衆，併送地檢處依法究辦。</p>

<h3>金價飛漲原因　央行配出兩百條　美鈔最高四千八百元　未結匯之進口貨尚多</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕金價不斷上漲，昨日達二百六十三萬餘元之高峯，詢之有關方面，謂其原因，可歸納如下：（一）游資充斥，既不敢投炎生產事業，高利貸又充滿風險，遂以購買黃金爲唯一保存價値辦法；（二）目前高利貸有採用抵押方式者，但几有押品，利息均低，較之購買黃金，獲利並不過大，而安全簡便不如，於是捨放利而購買黃金；（三）全國各大都市中，上海之企價較低，故有一部份游資集中本市買金，亦有人以此爲一種營業，在上海買金而運至他埠賣出，風險旣小，又甚便利。（四）一部份富有階級正在買進大量黃金，渠等認爲各種商品中，黃金漲價較小，將來必然高漲。至於美鈔之漲勢，不如黃金猛烈，則以投機之徒，深懼政府將來可能禁止美鈔在我國流通，故不敢大量買進也。</p>
<p>另訊，美鈔黑市仍趨堅挺，其原因由於政府雖已頒佈加強管制進口貿易辦法，嚴禁未經核準之洋貨進口，但本市已進口而未結匯之洋貨數量尚多，且走私進口之貨，事實上尚難禁絕，故商人對黑市美鈔之需要仍頗殷切，故行市於極秘密中仍極堅挺。</p>
<p>烚赤昨買戶不時蠢動，央行則全力應付，晨開二五八萬八有售，開後即被迫後退至二五七萬，無如人心向榮，一起回風，爭買復盛，不久又回漲至二六一萬五，逢高壓力頻仍，多方亦有了結實銷平淡，再回小至二五八萬五，央行　以二五八萬七五之價，配給二〇〇條，十時後一度非常安靜，十一時半左右買戶又起，市價立見扳高至二六三萬五左右，壓力被迫增重，午刻倐忽低落至二五九萬左右，午後隔日交割仍告上升，在二六〇萬五左右徘徊，結果較前收再升三萬四，飾金升爲念七萬四，紋銀三千八，銀元微昻，暗拆銀根尚平，暗息仍在一角二至一角半不等。</p>
<p>外幣形勢徘徊，美鈔門市仍以三五〇〇元至三五三〇元爲賣買價，晴市中高價四八〇〇元左右，午刻則回落至四七〇〇元左右，午後復告上升，在四七五〇元至四八〇〇元之間徘徊，較前收微漲，港票存低不豐，較前漲起十元，港匯實銷有限，九二〇元有供少求，印匯一一〇五元至一一一五元，英匯一四七〇〇元至一四八〇〇元成交仍祗港匯稍有做開，美匯牌價仍平，對做仍寂。</p>
<h3>餘額紗得自由開配　但以紗商業公會會員爲限　紡建開紗並通告限制辦法</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕吳市長於昨日下午三時許，先後召集第六區棉紡公會理事長王啓宇，紗商業公會理事長唐志良，常務理事周家聲，沈伯琴等，談話。紡管會業務處長劉文騰亦參加。吳市長以接棉紡公會來呈，請求將紡管會日前決議配予紗商業公會之餘額棉紗一點，加以修正，請改由各紗廠自由出售。經提出研究，最後決議，該項餘額棉紗，可由各紗廠自由配售予各廠素有往來之客戶，惟該項客戶，應以紗商業公會之會員爲限。討論至五時許當告散會。</p>
<p>中國紡建公　，昨日開售各支紗共一千二百五十一件。計十支立馬筒紗一八五件，每件一百五十三萬元。十六支豐年草包二四九件每件一百六十二萬元。十六支　風草包八件，價與十六支豐年相同。廿支立馬大包五三三件，每件五百卅三萬元。卅二支仙桃筒二七六件，每件二百卅二萬元。其他六十支雙股及八十支雙股無牌筒綫，掛價各爲五百五十五萬元及六百萬元，惟無人請購。聞昨日紗商請購者，共達六三九家。紡建公司特揭示二點：（一）已退出公會之商號，停止配售。（二）已停業之商號，不得朦請購買。如有假借，一經查實，當即轉呈究辦。惟據紗商業公會方面消息：昨向紡建公司請購之各商號，非會員亦占相當數目云。</p>
<p>昨日紗市明暗俱無，紗號同業雖照常入塲，均閒坐談天而已，絕對不談交易，上午紡建掛牌專配紗商業，渴望四個月之各家紗號，昨日纔得恢復申請承購，每家所配得之數額，雖極有限，實爲業中人之一帖興奮劑，又永安紗廠有一百五十件開出，半數售於向有往來之老戶頭，半數雖擬交由紗商公會普遍售予同業，然是項辦法決定時，市面已散，故暫予保留，至外間黑市以紡管會配貨在即，喊價略疲，四十二支藍鳳四〇〇萬元，二十支隻馬二三〇萬元。棉布市况，以津漢各地客幫逢低仍加垂靑，同業做開活絡，喊價堅平，本市染廠對坯布添辦尚夥，各檔貨在堅悄中徘徊，龍頭細布開盤九萬二千二百五有喊開，嗶嘰直貢亦頗見好。</p>

<h3>蘇聯不派員參加　聯合國文教會議　美國報章咸著社評論列　大會討論一九四七年度預算案</h3>
<p>〔聯合社巴黎廿一日電〕聯合國敎育科學文化機構籌備天會，今日討論一九四七年度預算案，總額七·五六五·〇〇〇美元，數國代表發表演說，要求取得各種計劃之優先權。預算案中最大項目，爲私人研究獎金，二·九七〇·一三〇美元，敎授研究獎金及股給金，共一·二五二·八七〇美元。此外，另加籌備委員會經費，約計九五〇·〇〇〇美元，本屆大會總經費，八·五一五·〇〇〇美元。</p>
<p>〔中央社巴黎廿一日專電〕聯合國敎育科學文化組織，今晨決定，邀請瑞典冰島派遣代表，及請瑞士派遣觀察者參加該組織第一次大會，但對西班牙流亡共和政府，要求准派觀察者參加一節，已予拒絕，此乃「因法律上之困難」。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎廿一日電〕聯合國教育科學文化會議，頃繼續開會，由中國代表趙元任博士發表演說後，南斯拉夫觀察者奧浦森斯基，繼之致辭稱：</p>
<p>個別文化如何保證</p>
<p>南斯拉夫迄今尙未批准聯合國敎育科學文化機構憲章，緣因此項憲章，對於反對法西斯主義與戰爭掮客者，並未規定任何保護辦法，再者，聯合國敎育科學文化機構，現雖有一工作計劃，但對於參與國個別文化之保存，並未能予以充分保證，上述二事，若能獲得保證，則南斯拉夫當可充分參與聯合國敎育科學文化機構之活動，不致再表示拒絕云。自南斯拉夫發表此項聲明之後，此間政界人士，咸認爲蘇聯亦與南斯拉夫採取類似見解，故亦拒不參加聯合國教育科學文化機構云。</p>
<p>虛席以待並未光臨</p>
<p>〔聯合社巴黎二十一日電〕聯合國敎育文化機構籌備大會，今日決定邀請西班牙共和國流亡政府派遣代表出席會議，此舉無異對弗朗哥統治之西班牙，予以間接打擊。波闌代表提議，邀請西班牙共和國爲旁聽員，但大會主席法國代表魯勃提議正式邀請，當經表決通過。先是大會秘書長英國代表赫胥黎報吿，聯合國文教機構許多決策，逃不出以蘇聯與美國爲中心之反對理想，故蘇聯之參加，極爲重要，思想的衝突，乃爲歷史現階段中無可如何之事實。文敎機構籌備委員會執行小組，雖爲蘇聯虛席以待，但蘇聯並未光臨，亦不派遣旁聽員出席，吾人咸引以爲憾。一個强大及文化前進之國，不加入爲金員，則本機構不能成爲眞正世界性云。</p>
<p>無警無權無警戒意</p>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓廿一日電〕美報章雜誌，近咸矚目巴黎之聯合國文敎科學組織首屆大會，對該會之活動，並著社評論列，與新聞報導。紐約時報本日略稱：「聯合國文敎科學組織，面臨一實際問題，即如何博　蘇聯加入與合作，美代表團俞往巴黎赴會，並有所建議。此項建議，並非紙上談兵之事，建議實際着手善後圖書館，博物院，實驗室及學校，獎勵研究氣象學，航海學，國際衛生及傳染病，合作去除課本中之激發憤恨情緒性質，協助交換學生，敎師，學者，藝術家，科學家，政府官員，及其他人員；研究如何促進並改善搜集智能，消息，及富有文化意味之資料，俾其交流於國際之間。蘇聯人士躊躇不前之原因，吾人不難了解，彼等不願其人民投入等認爲非正統思想之懷抱中，惟彼等若如吾人所希望而參加聯合國文敎科學組織，亦不致被迫接受此項思想，聯合國文敎科學組織，並無警衛權，亦無警戒之意。其針對「疑忌與不信任」之鬥爭以自願合作爲依歸，昨日爲此項工作之良好開端。黎昻布倫已膺選爲主席，此事顯示勇氣與憧憬，已獲承認，擬議中之預算數字爲九百萬美元，與前此十億至廿億元之估計數字相去甚遠，此事顯示該組織著有實事求是之意識。」</p>

<h3>河南人的重擔在安陽日擊的慘況</h3>
<p>— 本報特派員邵慎之</p>
<p>廿日訊</p>
<p>到黃泛區巡視　忍不住哭出來</p>
<p>如何把河南從災荒中拯救出來，答案的主要着眼點是在工程技術方面，而忽略政治。例如黃河堵口，是舉世週知的事，而中國工程界的黑暗面，却並不爲一般人所熟悉。原定在汎期前合龍的花園口新堤，活生生看它衝掉。</p>
<p>一位過慣江南生活的斯文人土，受過敎會敎育的自由主義者，到黃汎區去一看，當時就忍不住哭出來。他對我說：「災區裏的老百姓還老陪着笑臉同你說話，這大的是刺我出眼淚的直接原因。」這人並不脆弱，只是看到了今日的中國人生活有「原來如此」者，看到了災民臉上閃出的一絲笑容，彷彿探索到了他們的靈魂深處，他深心激動。他的眼淚，或者可以說是中國的希望了。</p>
<p>救濟分署的工作隊按戶發出麵粉後，有些地方的保甲長會去收回來，重新攤分，以使中飽，這是公開的。「這在我們就沒法管了。」救濟分署的負責人無可奈何地說。</p>
<p>花園口的工程，名義上是工賑，實際上是徵工，總署規定工賑是每工一斤半粉。「他們以爲工人是吃銀絲花捲的，一個工地上的工人一天要吃兩斤粉，吃到兩斤半的也有。」分署的實地工作者嘲笑着這種規定。不過承認聯總在這裏是着實化了一筆錢了。」最近傳出的消息，則是薩凡奇道位著名的水利工程師可能來看看。</p>
<p>尉氏縣樊家的曳引機訓練班是常遭共軍麻煩的，扣留人員或汽車是常事。</p>
<p>以扶溝縣一地而論，戰前有人口卅餘萬，現在只剩六萬人，過去的過去了，他們都沈入黃沙，而這些留下的人口中有二百多人瞎了眼，因爲缺乏營業，亮着眼的怎樣呢？他們多半仍是賠着笑臉同你說話。</p>
<p>古典主義排場　精神負担不堪</p>
<p>跑到省府所在地的開封街上，一位縣級人員向我慶幸他今天總算見到了省政當局，可以回去了。因爲從老遠的縣裏跑到古汴梁來，遽了片了，打了報吿，等了半月廿多天還見不着是通常的事。這眞是古典主義排塲。</p>
<p>馬道街六十八號有兩塊牌子：一是「河南省黃汎區復興建設協會」，一是「河南省黃汎區復興建設指導委員會」，但是無公可辦，經常在那裏的，便只有一位工友！</p>
<p>古典主義的排塲給了河南人一種精神上的負担！</p>
<p>內亂如果不停人民惟有上吊</p>
<p>河南有嚇人的攤派。我在豫北新鄕和安陽兩地所看到的，簡直是吃人的攤派，四十軍參謀長張濟是河南人，他懇切地對我說，「「豫北的老百姓眞苦啊！你們記者要寫寫啊！」內亂如果不停，和平不能實現，無論什麼地方，人民眞只有上吊了。</p>
<p>無論那一家商店或居戶，都能拿出一大疊自從勝利以來攤派款項，糧食，草，料，柴的通知單。那上面開着各種各樣的名目，洋洋大觀，令人目迷五色。一個月要攤派好幾回，就有好幾張單子。大致歸納起來，有下列各項：</p>
<p>第一是軍需，包括軍糧草料，各縣有補給分會，就地籌給，都是不給代價的派。安陽本年度七，八九三個月份車糧三百零五萬六千斤小麥，攤。限三日內送交。按「舊例」是商三民七，商會三成，七成通過鄉保甲攤。其間忽然又有某部軍糧要攤，只要臨時長官部有電報到縣，也立刻　。燒柴穀草麩料的攤派，到九月份已派到第七次，每决燒柴六百萬斤，穀草一百萬斤，麩皮五十萬斤，料五十萬斤。也是按照「舊例」。新鄕縣商會認派縣銀行的股金二千萬元，爲了派柴草，就此抵了出去。補給分會辦公費固然派　而來，爲了存一筆流動金，索性預先　幾千萬，也不以爲奇。甚至軍調部人員的膳費，安陽也要攤。因爲調令不淸，少　了數，隨時補　各款，也不以爲奇。軍事方面還看築工事，出人，出錢，出料，也就地攤征，攤目更加難以估計。</p>
<p>攤派已成風氣　忙煞各級機關</p>
<p>其次是各級行政機構的各種用費。一個保付不出攤款時，保長被縣府或鎭公所押起來，化費了錢，是攤；保甲長及辦事人員各處開會聽訓監工特別忙，車馬飯食開支浩大，也是攤；安陽的流亡縣府流亡縣級機關一百幾十個，替他們辦傢具跑腿，鄕鎭保甲奉命出力，用了錢，也是　；縣級公務人員改善待遇，一個月一攤就是一千幾百萬；縣級各機關的經費一個月一攤也是幾千萬元；鄕鎭保甲應酬各部份派來催款催料催工的人飯食香烟，一個保一月也要化幾十萬，爲了應什道種忙迫緊張的攤派公事，保辦公處要用七八個人，鎭公所好比縣政府，漏夜辦公，開支浩大，這些人一天到晚在頭腦裏轉着一個　字。至於保國民學校的經費，自然也是攤，不過每月數目微小，不及應酬催款催料者的幾頓飯食香烟。</p>
<p>再其次是非看不可的報，非看不過的戲，報費和戲票是新鄕商會的經常開支。還有將士慰勞金，沁陽保安團的制服費是新鄉地方攤的，因爲那是可以打仗的武裝。新鄕修一個漂亮的禮堂，一攤就是上千萬。一個什麼週判，什麼互助社，其「　金」也是　。諸如此類，一攤成風，不可收拾</p>
<p>安陽一居戶，有田四十畝，以現狀論，是窮光蛋，但仍該是小地主。九月份合計，機派現款二萬九千零七十三元；小麥一百零四斤；米四十四斤六兩；柴一百七十三斤；麩料五十八斤；草廿九斤。他對記者說想逃走，但無處可逃，再下去只好上吊。</p>
<p>一個小藥材舖在九月份上半月機了九百六十九斤半木柴，四百九十三斤小麥；一百六十一斤穀草；八十斤麩夫和八十斤料。這個藥材舖想關門，但怕吊掉他的老照牌，因此以後就不能開業。這就是說：不准關。</p>
<p>老百姓說，河南到處如此。我只看了安陽新鄕兩地，不希望其他地方也像這樣。無論如何，這是民不堪命的鐵的事實。一套縣行政機構在戰亂中變了攤派機構，還成什麼話？</p>

<h3>粵省府市府爭營業稅機構</h3>
<p>— 本報特派員梁風</p>
<p>十五日廣州航訊</p>
<p>在江南此時該是桂子飄香的季節，但在甫國却仍宛如夏末一樣的熱，熱得使人發悶，使人煩燥，一個多月以來沒有一滴雨，馬路上的灰塵，經汽車駛過飛揚起來，弄得到處烏烟瘴氣。</p>
<p>正如這情形一樣，最近這裏發生一件頗爲滑稽的事，眞令人啼笑皆非。不知是省府因經費困難，欲靠稅收來挹注？抑或市府見省府下半年預算營業稅可征三十六億元，市府僅得半數，而有點眼紅？以致發生省府市府爭營業稅征機構的一幕趣劇。</p>
<p>事情的演出是這樣的：在本月六日上午九時，廣州市區時參議會開第五次駐委會會議，由市財政局局長陳秉鐸作施政報吿後，參議員張希哲提出，市營業稅征收處究竟隸屬省府抑或市府的質詢，陳局長却鄭重答覆，以營業稅爲地方稅之一，應合併於稅捐處，市營稅處之設立，實爲不合法的組織，市府始終未予承認該機構的存在，且中央亦未承認其爲合法，不過省府不顧法令，設立而已！</p>
<p>此語一出，引起各界人士詫異，因該營業稅處已於九月一日正式成立，且也展開稅收業務達兩月餘，難道是不合法的組織嗎？那這個玩笑開得太大了！市府爲什麼不公吿週知，或運用行政與司法的權力把它撤消或控訴呢？但省府設立這機構，爲什麼會被市府指謫爲非法組織呢？這都使人不能懷疑內中關係的微妙了！</p>
<p>記者爲這事曾走訪各處，據省財政廳負責人稱：『營業說爲省稅及院轄市稅，業經卅五年七月二日國民政府公佈之財政收支系統法第八條明白規定，遍查奉頒各法，並無不得專設機構之規定，不能謂爲非法組織，而按照「國地共分各稅征收繳納辦法」第三條，亦謂營業稅的經行政院之核定，由中央征收機關代征或委託縣（市局）代征。所謂委託云者，須視有委託必要及委託機關能否負承辦責任而定。省府爲地方行政主管機關。自具權衡。本市營業稅業經省府核定，由廣州市營業稅征收處負責征收，並經公佈週知有案至前奉財政部電知，亦不過格於一般情形，爲免地方稅務日趨繁重，宜由縣市機構委託征收，但省府以本市營業數額，實佔全省泰半，爲適應特殊需要，以奏事功起見，故復經電請財部准仍由市營稅處負責征收，現候部核復中。」如此說來，營業稅旣規定爲省稅，省府自可設立機關辦理，也可以說在法令上沒有規定是不合法的囑。</p>
<p>可是，市府又怎樣吿訴我們呢？據市府負責人吿記者：「本府對此事，實欲以和平態度處理，不欲多言，惟有推行政令而已，不過在營業稅法第二條之規定，凡原屬中央省級（包括省轄市）直接稅收機關經辦之營業稅務，應即移交各省財政廳暨各縣市稅捐征收機關接收（餘略）……。故此法規內規定，亦應由各縣市稅捐處辦理，其决本府迭奉財部經地三陽第四四二七號代電略謂：「爲求縣市征收機構統一充實起見，不必另設機構。」又奉財部財經直二申陷電第三五八號，略謂：「電令直接稅局轉飭廣州分局照規定交貴府接管。」又接准廣東直接稅局兩電，均謂移交市稅捐征收處接辦，由以上各電文中，足以證明該營業處不准另行設立，規定交由本市稅捐處接管的。」樣看來，理由倒十分充足，否則焉敢冒犯頂頭上司。</p>
<p>記者爲了求詳起見，又赴廣州直接稅局查訽該局移交的經過情形。承吿：對營業稅移交問題，本局當時曾奉部令依照「土地稅契稅營業稅移交地方接管辦法」，對營業稅準備移交市稅捐處辦理，嗣後接省府函謂，已成立營業稅征收處，函請接管，而同時復接市府來函請移交營業稅。本局於此即呈請核示，於九月廿六日奉財部第三三九五號電復，應移交市稅捐征收處接管，本局正擬移交，而又在九月廿八日接省府申儉財六字第二二五五七號代電謂，營業稅處業已應立，詳細理由亦呈請財部核示中，在未奉復前，請暫緩移交。本局又電財部請示，仍奉照案移交市稅捐處，後又准市稅捐處函謂，奉省府令飭營業稅征收處歸市府管轄，請移交並派秘書陳慶龍到局接洽交接，到此本局乃於十月五日正式將營業稅移交云。</p>
<p>綜看以上各處發表的意見，省府持的是「法令」，市府却是明正言順的奉的「部令」，各有各的理由，這樣倒似乎變成「法令」與「部令」有了矛盾了。</p>
<p>好在這料紛並沒擴大，這一個複雜的問題，終於昨（十）日報載，財政部電令謂：「本部爲求縣市徵收機關統一，俾能因應，以赴事功起見，業已另案統籌辦理，至廣州營業土地契稅，應一律由該市徵收機關接辦，不另設置機關，所擬專設營業處一節，應停止實行」。在這裏面我們總算得到了一個明確的答覆——市府是勝利了，祗不過在社會的視聽上，在全市市民的心上却留下了，「未免太笑話了」的印象呵！</p>

<h3>齊白石在書史上的地位</h3>
<p>— 俞劍華</p>
<p>齊白石在近代的中國繪畫史上無論如何總已經佔了一個地位，不過這個地位的高低現在還不能論定。</p>
<p>蘇東坡題吳道子的畫說：「知者創物，能者述爲」。所謂知者就是先知先覺的聖哲，也就是能獨創一派的大家。也就是不爲威屈，不爲利誘，不顧利害，不計毀譽，獨往獨來，認淸目標，抱定宗旨，不迎合時向，不隨波逐浪，終身爲眞理而奮鬥，不達目的不止的革命性的改革家。在初創的時候，非笑攻擊，紛至沓來，社會責難，政府壓迫，甚至投入監牢，宣布死刑，釘上十字架。但是等到成了功，那就要左右風氣，造成派別，甚至萬衆膜拜，百世景仰。成了千古不朽的人物。</p>
<p>所謂能者是本領不及創者，僅能學習創者，模倣創者，繼承創者，或得其一體，或具體而微。蕭規曹隨，亦步亦趨，學得有幾分像，已經很滿足了。高明在上，絕不敢有度前賢的奢望。只能藉「述而不作」爲解嘲，「戞戞獨造」的精神就微乎其微了。</p>
<p>在淸末民初直到現在，大寫意的花卉翎毛一派，自然吳昌碩是「創者」，王一亭齊白石都不免要屈居「述者」之列，雖然齊氏也有他的獨特風格。</p>
<p>蘇東坡荀卿論上說：「其父殺人報仇，其子必且行刧」，這也就是說開創的人，雖然是槃槃大才的作家，但不免稍有所偏。一種文藝作品，太規矩正派了，未免乏味，所以文藝作家都喜歡別出心裁，別樹一幟，想以奇兵制勝。並且世間全才少，偏才多，一個人的偏處，就是他的長處，儘量發展他的偏處，也就是儘量發展他的個性，所以能異軍突起，獨成一家。文藝家這種偏長的地方最爲顯著，形成一種與衆不同的面貌，一望而知爲某人某派的作品。不過在開創的人在起初並不見得有心創爲某派，只不過順性之所近，力之所及，積多年的研究，不知不覺的演變成某一種的面貌罷了。例如石濤八大早年的畫也很工細，吳昌碩早年的畫也很秀逸，淸道人的字早年也不是那樣一曲一曲的「一波三折」。</p>
<p>一個人的偏處，在正面看來是他的長處，在反面看來，却正是他的短處，所以很容易發生流弊。筆墨豪放，本來是長處，但易流於覇悍。筆墨秀逸，本來是長處，但易流於柔弱。所以剛勁者先之直率，精細者光之瑣碎，厚重者失之混濁，飄洒者失之輕佻，豔麗者失之鄙俗，淸淡者失之　疏，有一利必有一弊，在開創的人，本來是利多弊少，長處還可以把短處掩蔽，不甚顯然。但是到子學他的人，却把他的偏處儘　發揮，儘量延長，變本加厲，把偏的地方變成習氣，把長的地方變成毛病，相習成風，而　遵以弊，竟出乎創始者的意料之外。</p>
<p>寫意花卉之有吳昌碩碩，已非揚州八怪所能想像；吳氏之後有王一事與吳氏相去尙不甚遠。至於齊白石純用洋紅寫花，純川濃墨塗葉的那種楓樹，紅　，秋海棠，荷花，菊花，恐怕就非吳氏始料所及了。</p>
<p>一個畫家能卓然成家，自然有他的眞實的本領，和獨特的而貌。獨特的而貌很容易學，眞實的本領，却不易學。昌碩的粗枝大葉易學，昌碩的金石之氣却不易學。一事的筆飛墨舞易學，一亭的醇古之氣却不易學，白石的紅花墨葉易學，白石的兀傲不平之氣却不易學。從這一點看來，三家可以說是各有千秋。</p>
<p>一個畫家不必門門都精，只要有一兩門拿手的傑作爲他人所望　莫及，也就足以自成一家了。文與可只畫竹子，趙子固只能畫水仙，倪雲林只能寫枯木草亭，鄭所南只能畫蘭草，一藝之精，一技之長，只要能登峯造極，也可以千古不朽，「秋之於奕，僚之）於丸，養由墓之於射，張旭之於草　」，都是終身專精一藝的，齊白石只要畫兩幅蟹和蝦，不但在現在可以說是舉世無雙，就是在畫史上也可以佔一個相當的地位，似乎不必多用紅紅綠綠的顏色和人家爭艷鬥麗。</p>
<p>吳王齊三家大體上看來是可說屬於一派的，細細分別，三家又各有不同，吳氏但寫花卉，（初期也兼畫山水）王氏則兼寫花鳥人物，尤其擅長佛像。齊氏則人物花鳥山水俱寫，而以蟹　草蟲爲佳。因此可以看出要學一個人，雖然學的唯妙唯肖，不過成功爲複製品，最多只能成第二流的「述者」，要在師門以外，別有擅長，爲前人所未有，大部分雖爲「述者」，但也有一部分是「創者」，他在藝術上的地位也就爲之提高不少了。要是王齊二氏都只畫兩筆粗枝大葉的花卉，沒有自己獨特之點，那就很難和吳氏並駕齊驅了。</p>
<p>一個畫派有開創的人，也有結束的人，例如婁東畫派，黃子久是創始的人，王　臺就是結束的人，因爲到他已經達到最高潮，不能再前進了，浙派創始於戴文進吳小僊，到了張平山蔣三松和藍田叔就非結束不行了，當然在結束的人以後，還不免有許多希聲慕勢，或景行嚮往的人，那已成了頹流餘波，强弩之末，等於「自檜以下」不足論了。近代。大寫意花卉吳昌碩自然是開路先鋒，但是結束這一派的責任，似乎應該是齊白石吧。</p>
<p>所以我說在近代的中國繪畫史上，無論如何，齊氏應該佔了一個地位，至於這個地位的高低，只好等到將來寫中國繪畫史的人再替他確定了。（卅五年十一月十九日草於上海萬籟齊鳴之樓。）</p>
<h3>齊白石先生傳略</h3>
<p>— 榮卓</p>
<p>白石老人，今年八十六歲了。他生長在湖南湘潭的白石村，所以自署爲白石山人，他名璜，字瀕生，他一生的別暑很多，如杏子塢老民，借山翁，寄萍堂主人，三百石印富翁，木居士，老木一等都是常用的別署，中年以前，曾有一個時期署爲寄幻奴，現在却不用了。</p>
<p>他出生在一個農耕而淸貧之家，少年的景况，十分黯淡·十二歲時，就學製粗笨木質的日常傢具，過一年，改學雕刻本板花紋，他的藝術基礎，種因於此。</p>
<p>常他從事學習雕刻本板花紋的時候，白畫裏替人家雕刻花板，晚上便買油點燈，在燈下學習繪畫，他這樣好學，自然有些長進，湖南同鄕胡沁園先生見其畫，聞其努力，就邀入其家，加以鼓勵，並且介紹到在鄕內有畫名的蕭薌階先生處習畫，同時又介紹到鄕內頗負詩名的陳紹蕃先生處習詩，學畫，加倍努力。</p>
<p>過了幾年湘潭的人士差不多都知道他能詩能畫了。首先由其同鄕楊松萃介紹認識郭保生先生。郭先生是當時一個有名的軍人，雅好書　，因此訂爲交好，不久又認識了故監察委員黎雨民先生，以後交游更廣，在野的有王仲言·陳伙根·羅醒吾·羅眞吾·胡立山·譚子荃諸先生，這六位與白石先生在龍山地方曾結詩社，當時的人，稱爲龍山七子。同時在文學界負盛名的王湘綺。樊樊山·夏午詒·楊晳子諸光生等也分別結爲師友。</p>
<p>他的友好旣然一天一天多，因此就有許多人邀他遠游，曾西去秦中，南游粵桂，北抵幽燕，暢游名勝，在陝西時，曾爲樊山先生治印極多，樊公勸他出仕，並贈以「寗獨蛟螭　金　，便偕　鼎證明堂」之句；他婉言謝絕。初次在北京時，曾有人要他由廖大姑筠仙介紹去謁慈禧太后。他却突然有歸志，即日南返，當楊晳子等辦籌安會時，曾再三電邀游北平，他老是住在故鄕的借山館，在碧紗櫉裏研究小學篆刻，繪畫不肯休息，這樣的生活足足的有了四個年頭。</p>
<p>一直到民國六七年時，以後湘潭的土匪多，湖南又有戰事，他才離開了甜蜜的故鄕，避居北平，開始過他的賣畫生活，在那二十年的中間，他雖然　過湖南，到過四川，但是住北平的日子多。七七事變以後，他來不及收拾北方的家事，困處在暴日的鐵蹄下，他不受利誘，不怕威脅，不厭貧苦，老是閉門住定北平西單跨車胡同，最近九年多的苦難生活，他的內心異常痛苦。</p>
<p>勝利以後已一年多了，他依然健康，並且還能由北平趁飛機來京滬，游刦後的首都和繁華的上海；此次他與其子子孫孫，客巾相見，在京滬兩地又能與多數藝友把晤，這是白石先生老年的生活史上最愉快的一頁。</p>

<h3>一寸山河一寸血　101</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>侍者安挑好了鶴見所要的一點飲料和小食，躬身退下之後，鶴見燃上了一隻烟捲，預備集中思想，盤算怎樣對付門外那羣東西。他的座位，正是一個很舒適的暗陬，一面可以看到整個舞池，一面也可以注意入口的人來人往。他先把舞池裏的舞衆，仔細留意檢視了一下，看看有否關係人物，有吾自己的手下，然後又把未曾起舞的尋些男女，也逐一掃射了一遍，覺得他本人在這衷，只是孤另另一人；旣無一人注意他，也無一個認識的面孔。惟一能引起他注意的，只有十來個外國男女，男的穿着整齊的禮服，看他們的舉止行動，一望而知是德國的第五縱隊人員，那些女的，却一時辨別不出。</p>
<p>這時這隻「少女之春」已經來回奏演了三遍，歌手已經換了兩名，舞池的對子，一大部分，舞興正酣，却不願下塲，樂隊只好換了一隻西洋探戈。正在這樂聲轉換的當口，鶴見把在塲的人，的略檢視完畢，忽然瞥見人口的大格子法式玻璃長門一開，招待躬身嚴肅地，引進了一位靑年女子。這女子雖穿着一身標準西服，身個也有五呎二三的高度，却能看得出是個日本血統。</p>
<p>僅僅在她進塲一展身段的那一剎那，鶴見已經給她的姿容儀態，下了一個九十五分的評註。這是山於她的體格勻亭，各局部位合度，眼眉口鼻，照整個臉議看，都在水準以上；尤其重要的，就是內心的靈活，都融成了一片嫵媚的風韻，從皮膚的色度，和各部位的姿態上，蒸發出來，成了一種自然能够攝人心目的艷　光彩。</p>
<p>像鶴見這樣鋼鐵一般意志的靑年，本來不易動心。何况在美的一點上，他的心目中只有一個耀羣·　羣的美，除了外表各項條件都合標準之外，美在骨裏，美在心靈上。而且美麗之外，還有一種不爽的風姿，是尋常佳麗够不到的。這倒不是通當人所謂「情人眼裏出西施」的說法。就呌許多第三者來，把耀羣和這位日本女子比較一下，這日本女子要是有九十五分的評斷，耀羣至少要高她這麼一兩分。</p>
<p>爲什麼有這一兩分上下分別呢？因爲耀羣是純然一片天眞，這個日本女子，多少有些矯揉造作的意味。從鶴見那雙犀利的眼光看來，這個女子，身上準定有些精秘：不是復興曾；必是特務工作；要不，就是黑龍會員，或是「天潢修永」的社員，然而決不是左傾的「民族保進社」份子。總之，必是一個秘密人物。</p>
<p>這話並無十絲武斷的成分；因爲萬般藝業，都有一個內行外行的分別。要是一個不相干的外行，從內行眼光一照，總覺得你一舉一動，有些不合轍的地方。那怕一個客串的票友，雖說苦唱苦練過，不是科班出身，你總免不了是一個「羊」，何况根本不是票友呢？相反地，如果你是一個內行，縱令本領不高，那一舉手一投足之間，處處都石規矩，處處都合尺寸；所以內行一見，就能辨別。斡着秘密工作的人，無論你如何善於掩飾，也瞞不過有資歷的眼睛；因爲他們經過如此訓練，也就如此演出，雖說　量掩飾，也就好像孫悟空七十二變，任是變來變去，在我佛如來的眼睛裏，她還是一　毛猴。</p>

<p>第一，中國藝人，未受社會重視。此次白石老人由政府邀請南來，並受文化界熱列歡迎，如果沒有意外的誤會，必能藉此增加社會對藝術與藝人的重視。還望老人領導中國藝術界從此向偉大光明的前途邁進。</p>
<p>第二，現在的中國危頹已極，雖有同盟國援助，而立國立身全在自立，我不懂政治，亦不明外交，但只知倚賴這國或那國的支持，總非自立之道。藝術以創造獨立與自由的精神爲主旨，願老人以藝術精神，　爲風氣，挽救垂危的中國風尙。</p>
<p>第三，中國海關出口與入口竟達一與二十之比，中國人度量是很寬大的，盡量的把外國貨吞食進去，現在所進口的還不過是香烟罐頭食品與玻璃皮包之類，有一天建設開始，重工業所用的機器與原料將源源而來，我們什麼本領來平衡外匯呢？我們可與外國人競爭的，只有藝術品。我不是說搬了周鼎唐　的老古董去賣給外國，我說的是應用中國的藝術才能去改良工商品，就已有的手工品，再加改良，行銷外國。此種出品，隨處皆有，如竹漆瓷綢，不必設立工廠，只向各地民間指導製造，按件收購。形色務求美觀，切合心理，並多就塔廟等圖形，服裝與歷史的特殊意義，能引人愛好者，盡量的加以裝飾。老人誠能登高一呼，亦不失爲藝術救國之道。</p>
<p>第四，我平日甚以學行毫無成就，而年紀已近半百爲憾。老人高壽八十有六，個人的成績不及齊老先生的分毫，而我的四十九歲亦僅只當老人之半。學藝同人中有年僅老人三分之一，四分之一的，我們大可奮勉，孜孜爲學，將來必有成功，能如是，則吾人皆老人弟子矣！</p>
<p>祝白石老人沿途平安，福壽康寗！</p>

<h3>金魚</h3>
<p>— 少夫</p>
<p>四個月前買了兩尾金魚，養在一隻水果盤子裏，八我不知什麼地方可買到大的金魚缸）除了每天淸晨由傭人換一次水外，再也無其它的伺候了，但這一對夫婦就在這隻水果盤子裏養得旣肥且壯，優哉遊哉地過了四個月。</p>
<p>盤子放在書室的寫字　上，寂靜中常聽到牠們細碎的喋唼聲，它雖然細微，却非常眞切，我往往就此拋下書本，凝想到生命這一類問題上去。</p>
<p>他們不停地在浮沉，追逐，喋唼，模樣都很愉快自如，又幾曾煩惱於這隻水果盤子的世界。</p>
<p>生命如果像滾雪球，如果像放複息的窩利貸，時間會造成偉大，會偉大到不可思議；如果像被燃點的臘燭，結果將一無所有。</p>
<p>也許我們大多數人都像這兩尾金魚，我們的世界，是一隻無形的水果盤子，有邊緣，也有那麼一種奧底，而大家渾渾噩噩地自得其樂地在生活下去，等待最後那自然的消滅。</p>
<p>和金魚一樣，我們並不自覺，因此也就無可悲哀了。</p>
<h3>鈔票難點　通貨往來的一大問題</h3>
<p>— 陳天鐸</p>
<p>我們有時到銀行裏拿鉅量鈔票的時候，一方面爲避免手續上的麻煩，一方面因相信銀行之信用，往往不加檢點，拿了就跑：但當你把牠另碎用出去的時候，可能發現缺少相當數目，這種情形直接有損於客戶本身的利益，間接影響於銀行之信譽。用敢貢獻一些意見：</p>
<p>夷考原因，實也簡單：爲了法幣貶値，票面朱增，因而發生巨量鈔票無法點數情事。本來，金融業向來習慣，銀行同業，彼此信任，見有經手出納員蓋章，即不再覆點，轉用於外，通常祗點大數，不點小數。事實上，出納人員有限，如以每人每日點五百萬元計，則十人亦不過點五千萬元，而銀行每日所經手收付之現款，常在數萬萬元左右。補救之道，有如下列：</p>
<p>提倡並改進票據信用制度，如歐美各國，各正常公民均與銀行有往來，都沿用此種制度。此不但能减少數點現鈔之困難，並且能鞏固金融，養成良好之票據信用制度。此其一；</p>
<p>銀行增加辦事人員及提高其能力，學識，人格之氣質，如是則可求手續之敏捷，亦能加强銀行信譽；同時並須注意改善行員之生活。此其二。</p>
<p>最後，筆者希望這嚴重的現鈔缺數問題，能因票據制度的改良及道德信誠的原則加以改進，致於消滅；同時，亦希望客戶負起這個責任來，以保全各人木身的利益。</p>
<p>再者，如果能以妥善迎密方法，調整幣制，則上述問題即根本解決矣！</p>

<h3>立體電影</h3>
<p>— 郁張</p>
<p>蘇聯可以說是世界上第一個將立體電影放映在三向度銀幕上的國家。</p>
<p>一個會在莫斯科看過幾决立體電影實騐放映的外國記者，寫了一篇通訊說：「一輛坦克車直向你駛來—一分鐘的時間，它就要壓扁你了—啊！它開到你頭上來了！你急忙將頭低下去，歪向一傍—但是，一點也朱發生什麼事。你只不過是在看電影—看立體電影。」</p>
<p>各國科學家們早已在研究攝製立體電影的方法了。最先的一羣，利用立體鏡的原理拍攝，但是祗能拍攝靜的事物，如同幻燈一般，說不上是電影了。而且看起來也不便當，觀衆的眼睛都要戴一副透鏡。</p>
<p>第二期的研究者，用一種「凸出法」。放映時，也有兩張銀幕，一張映紅色影片，另一張映綠色影片，觀衆也戴一副紅緣色的眼鏡——紅色鏡片看綠　電影，綠色鏡片看紅色電影—兩色影片的影像重合於一個焦點，看起來，便如同立體一般。這種立體電影，單純的紅綠兩色的本身就是一個缺憾，而且有色鏡片遮去大量的光綫，使電影暗淡不淸。</p>
<p>第三期，也是最成功的方法，就是現在蘇聯所研究的。觀衆不需要戴任何種特製的眼鏡，而且看起來非常淸浙。所有的影像藝是完整的。</p>
<p>數年前，薩姆揚。伊凡諾夫（Semyon　Ivanov）—蘇聯工程師，一個鞋匠的兒子—對平面電影感到不滿，便着手研究立體電影。他用許多銀幕實騐，造成不同的平面、可能用密佈的細金屬綫穿越過它們，將它們　結起來。這樣，銀幕就有了沈度。他發現：祗要配合以適當的投影器具（放映機），這種銀幕便不需要眼鏡而能產生立體鏡的効果。但是這種銀幕需要很長的金屬綫，費用太大。雖然經過許多改良，他的最後一具投影面積二十五平方碼的銀幕，還要用一百十二哩長的金屬綫。</p>
<p>大戰時期，伊凡諾失主要的工作是服務於軍中，從事航空測量，由於他的立體鏡的工具，使他成爲蘇聯航　攝影專家中最成功的一　。</p>
<p>雖然如此，他始終未曾放棄立體電影的研究工作。戰爭的第三年，他有了一個很大的成就，就是將銀幕上的金屬綫代之以大量的圓錐形的透鏡。這種投影平面現在已經完成了，安置在普通的戲院內，對任何角落裏的觀衆都能收到淸浙的立體鏡的効果。</p>
<p>「凡諾天銀幕」重逾一噸。放映的方法也完全成功了。去年，伊凡諾夫在喬治亞共和國與外高加索聯邦共同的首府所在地第佛利斯城攝製了第一部長　的立體影片—書賓遜漂遊記。</p>
<p>正如有聲影片淘汰了默片，立體影片亦將取平面影片之地位而代之。蘇聯現在計劃建築二十座專映立體電影的影戲院，第一所巳於最近在莫斯科落成。至於將普通影戲院改成放映立體電影的影戲院，也是一件比較簡單的事。「伊凡諾夫銀幕」可以適合的裝在普通銀幕的前面，而放映室和觀衆廳都不需改造。</p>
<h3>不妨試試　創造複音字</h3>
<p>— 兪福南</p>
<p>十四日報上載有「　」「髡」一百萬元微音獎金的廣吿，其實這二個字要各呼一個確切而又生動的音是很不容易的。我們知道世界上除了我們中華民國外大都用拚音文字的，一個字有一音的，也有二個音三個音的複香字。所以外國文字大概每個字都代表着一個意義，而並不像找們有些字不能單獨成立的，例如「枇杷」二字，單提一字來看，便不知所解了。這二個字只能算字母，拚在一起才有意義。</p>
<p>因此，許多人認爲我國文字已落伍了，在現代已不够應用，不便應用了。記得在本年三月裏，參政會中也曾提出了改革文字的意見。注音符號的推行實在是一種良好的改進，不過在社會上還未見普遍化，一個俄國人的名字會常譯成一大串嚕囌的字，何不把牠譯注音符號更爽快。</p>
<p>同時，我們更得得提倡一種複音字來補救，而淘汰那些不能單獨成立的字。好久以前就有人提過詞兒連寫，（一個詞若包括二個字或三個字的都該連寫在一起）在複音字創造還未成功時，是極當採用的。然後，由連寫而簡化演進爲複音字。像圖書館三字，近人簡寫爲「　」；現已爲社會上所公用了，這個「　」字，當然依舊讀爲圖書館三音。這個「　」字，便是複音字創造成功的一個例子。</p>
<p>以我個人愚見，如枇杷二字可寫成「　」這個複音字，同樣，琵琶可寫成「琶」，梧桐可寫成「　」，螞蟻可寫威「　」，（這裏最好簡寫以避太多的筆劃）諸如此類的雙聲疊韻字，大都均可創造一個複音字來，而廣吿上的「究」和「　」，也正不必定須呼一個單音呢？質之先進，未知以爲如何？這襄尙須說明的是我並不是想把所有的詞都寫成複音字，而只希望淘汰那些不能單獨成立的字）</p>
<p>我以爲：不妨試試！</p>
<h3>爲何無下文</h3>
<p>— 卓球</p>
<p>前法公董局職員呼聲</p>
<p>本年四五月間，前工部局退職人員的「申請退職金」問題，獲得了圓滿的答覆，接着法總領署方面，也未甘落後，對於公董局和警務處舊屬表示可以申請登記。他們這種「從善如流」的氣度，完全建築在「中法友好」的關係上。事實上，公董局過去的財政本是歲有盈餘的，至今他遺賸項下的建築物和其他動產不動產，依然擁着一個碩大無朋的數値。</p>
<p>但過去，法公董局和警務處的職員大都「各自爲政」，門戶之見太深，從沒有組織過一個類似聯誼社或是俱樂部的團體。這個傳統的散漫的弱點，影響到這次的申請退職金的結果。</p>
<p>因此，登記手續，結束到好幾個月了，退職人員代表王某和法國駐滬領事的會談，也遠在一個月前開始，但至今，仍然下文缺缺。</p>
<p>我們的退職人員中，很多還是賦閒在家，他們大都在僞組織接收法租界時期，存着抱殘守缺的決心，和法國人同時結束了職務的命運。他們仍苦等着退職金的下文。</p>
<p>最近，聽說；「前法租界債務，舊曆年終淸償。」我們相信法總領署的這張支票，不久即可兌現，而不至不了了之。</p>
<h3>週末茶話　創造</h3>
<p>以毒功毒</p>
<p>報載台北劇盜吳生財，同夥有一十二名好漢、專事打家刧舍，無惡不作，在臺省有十二星相之譽，官廳雖多方緝捕，奈這位「狗星」行蹤飄忽，始終可望而不可即；偏巧台北劇院開映美片「隱身大盜」，吳好漢不知怎樣心血來潮，想趁此機會，觀摩研討一番，冀增心得，於是　然　止，這纔被警探們一聲吆喝，逮入綱羅。讀報至此，實在要拍案呌絕。我們從前常批評好萊塢製商，儘用一套神怪電影騙人鈔票，誨浮誨盜，春秋責備　者，言下無限憤慨，現在想想眞頗有悔此一駡之感。由國的「中庸」之道畢竟有其眞理在，我們忽略了製片商「寓捉於怪」的深意反而大事否定，實在有傷中腦。</p>
<p>且話禁娼</p>
<p>繼抽　淘汰人力車之後，當局又有抽籤淘汰全市十萬娼妓的五年計劃了。這兩天晚上，許多風化區內「即將有新出路」的女士們，在寒風衷好像分外活躍；我想這大概是因爲：一方面冬季屆臨，取締雉妓的工作不能不暫吿「冬眠」所致；他方面也許她們曰知道行業已成强弩之末，爲了迎接新生，於是特意萊個臨別表演，以資紀念一下之故，不管她們這種活躍是否爲暗示對「計劃」的抗議或擁護，我認爲「禁娼論」在目前實在是有其時代意義的。因爲上海娼妓的存在，感受最大威脅的是坐在家裏的善良的太太之類，太太爲了維持他們家庭的溫暖，除了對「先生」實施各種各樣的防備之外，最要緊的還是修飾自己來和娼妓奪「愛」。因此本來祗是供應一般娼妓之流的奢侈品，太太們也就逐漸爭購起來。太太旣事打扮，娼妓更求充實，彼此各不相讓，大家兼程急進，海關上香粉口紅，玻璃皮包的入超數字於是膨漲起來了。追根　源，　在娼妓，此時禁娼面有計劃，誰曰不宜？</p>
<p>人畜同悲</p>
<p>據說最近聯總又有一批物資運華，裏面形形色色，如醬油，辣椒，醋之類，應有盡有；最珍貴的還有「騾子」七九二匹，可謂蔚爲大觀。這批驟子在天津行總儲運局「曾受短期訓練」，「體軀肥壯」，「不但飼養經濟，且比國產騾匹更能吃苦耐勞」，因此在山西「已被農民爭購一空」。有人於此頗表遺憾，對號稱我們中原特產的騾子之不能「吃苦耐勞」嘖有煩言，這種愛國及畜之論，我想是「人同此心」的。但徵諸事實；國產騾子素質雖優，年來因農家普遍破產，人民已生計維艱，飼養自更因陋就簡，偸工减料，食以粗爄是想像中的事。「騾共主人瘦」，流離溝　之餘，在嘗慣珍　，營　豐富的花旗騾子前，常然要自慚形鐵的了。其實以獸　人，何嘗又非如此？上海這兩天各機關大規模上街勸諭節電，但理髮店的吹風兀自未停；局長親自勘查茅則，而爾所老　漲價如故。生活逼人，人且不　功令若此，與我們的　子何尤哉！</p>
<p>文儈錯矣</p>
<p>記得上月間在上海各界歡迎魯斯來華的茶會之後，曾經有一個名呌李永康的爲印售「西洋金瓶梅」被捉將官裏去，道兩件事雖然是一時巧合，但多少總算給我們文化界開了一個不小的玩笑。事隔未久，孰料「紅褲子」「你恩我愛」等名作聽說又被審查通過，準許發行了。這件事後來當局曾一度　認，其實這否認是多餘的；本來人　向下，黃色文字必然應運而生，在。誘姦」「强姦」事件不絕如樓的社　裏，「文化商業化」實在是應天順人，「時代產物」，正如救濟品能一　而爲營業品一樣，原是一丘之貉，我們本無用其厚此薄彼，大驚小怪。不過李永康之流也笨得很，爲什麼不乘魯斯來華之便，在茶會後向他訪問一番？若然，則其巨著「西洋金瓶梅」就可以幕臨「時代」的意境和　髓，談風月而能留點乳罩，×××，之類，不必深入，適可而止，豈非　然一中國蓅綫型刋物？不幸錯此一着，致成衆怨所歸，而唯此馬首是　，亦步亦趨的「紅褲子」第作品，也就一會兒通過，一會兒否認的關得近似猜　了。</p>
<h3>混堂</h3>
<p>— 蔡麟</p>
<p>上海橫斷面</p>
<p>「混堂」就是浴室，洗澡與淴浴一樣的都脫了衣服入水的。</p>
<p>混堂裏的毛巾是不分上下的，剛剛甲浴客揩過××，一回兒乙浴客在擦險了。</p>
<p>池裏的水，黑得似墨汗，而且濃得彷彿如羹湯一般，而一班浴客浸在這泥湯中猶不嫌其航　。</p>
<p>有不少患腳癬與　疥瘡的浴客，皆喜歡在「焦池」中以沸水洗擦，這樣才足以殺痒，皮膚病據說混堂裏不會傳染的，這不知根據什么理由。</p>
<p>衛省家如果跑進混堂裏去考察一下的話，認爲浴客個個是冒險家，他們大概都是出汚泥而不染的。</p>
<p>混堂裏表面上確是不衛生，不過招待得非常週到，熱氣騰騰的毛巾，不斷地送來，堂倌時時刻刻來替自己揩背心。</p>
<p>在池裏洗浴，不用自已動手，擦背的會把自己混身的齷齪，用一種軟硬工夫的手段，洗得一乾二凈，雖然擦背的有一句不好聽的術語，呌做「撈浮屍」。</p>
<p>躺在臘羅上，那「揑脚」的坐在你的對面，他一邊在替你揑脚，一邊郤在留心你面部的表情，而手勢的輕重，能善解人意，所謂　着癢處。</p>
<p>幾個老浴客，每天見面，暢所欲言，無話不談，因此有許多家裏雖然有着衛生設備的浴室，可是他遺是喜歡上混堂去淴板浴，因此混堂的營業，至今不衰，家庭浴室，望塵莫及，衛生家搖頭歎息！</p>
<p>低調</p>
<h3>自動提高待遇</h3>
<p>— 醉</p>
<p>電車加價後，首先身受其惠的是售票員；他們從前揩一次决油不過二十元到五十元，現在則一揩就是一百元，這呌做：公司加價，售票員自動提高待遇。</p>
<h3>一百元五個圈</h3>
<p>— 休矣生</p>
<p>馬路邊堆着：橘子，泥人，糖果，香烟；分成行列，若有陣勢。陣前用白粉畫着立脚點；脚前寫着：」一百元五個圈」！</p>
<p>圈子丟光了，拿不着橘子，泥人，糖果，香烟；小孩子，（也許是成人）便走開。執業者再等着第二人，第三人。</p>
<p>「地租三尺，布賒三匹」的攤頭，變成這「一百元五個圈」的把戲；吃飯的花樣是多了，這是在邁進着生產的社會敎育！</p>
<h3>黃金變糞土</h3>
<p>— 贊英</p>
<p>石達開說：「黃金如糞土」，而今却是「黃金變糞土」了；復興島的黃金，已化成兩缸糞土。在上海，戲法雖多的是，但黃金變糞，尙以此次爲創舉。</p>

<h3>Completion of Constitutional Draft Legislative Procedures, Submitted to the Government for Submission to the National Assembly, Legislative Yuan Passes Constitutional Draft Amendment</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing 22nd Dispatch] The Republic of China Constitution Draft Amendment, which has been the focus of national attention, was passed unanimously without objection in the Fourth Temporary Session of the Fourth Legislative Yuan at 2:30 p.m. on the 22nd, after being reviewed and passed by the joint review meeting of the five committees of the Legislative Yuan in the morning, following the resolutions of the Central Standing Committee. The constitutional drafting legislative process, which involved numerous meetings and debates over several days, was thus officially completed. The case can be sent to the National Government on the 23rd and then to the National Assembly as a reference for constitutional drafting. More than 50 legislators attended today's plenary session of the Legislative Yuan, chaired by Sun Ke. After Wu Shangying reported on the minutes of the previous meeting and other documents, the discussion of the constitutional draft began. First, Lin Bin reported in detail on the review process of the Republic of China Constitution Draft Amendment by the joint meeting of the five committees, including the circumstances of the three review meetings on the 13th, 16th, and today, and the supplementary procedures of the Central Standing Committee. The case has been decided by the joint review meeting this morning to follow the resolutions of the Central Standing Committee, and it is submitted to the General Assembly for public decision. After the report, Wu Yunpeng immediately stood up and spoke, hoping that the due status of all ethnic groups should be clearly stipulated in the constitution to ensure its protection and conform to the true meaning of equality among all ethnic groups. Wu believed that if the Legislative Yuan passed the constitutional draft without changing a single word, it would be best to attach this opinion to the National Assembly. Di Ying also Wang requested that the petition submitted by the Mongolian representatives to the Legislative Yuan last time be drafted by the Legislative Yuan into a written opinion and forwarded to the National Assembly. At this point, the legislators believed that since the case had been passed by the review committee without changing a single word, it was not necessary to discuss the content in detail in this meeting. Chen Zifeng suggested that the entire constitutional draft be submitted to the National Assembly for further content revisions. Chen Guyuan also believed that there was no need to talk more about the content. Then, Sun Ke, in his low tone, summarized the review process. Legislator Gu also listened attentively, and the atmosphere at the meeting became more solemn. Sun first pointed out that the constitutional draft promulgated by the National Government on May 5, 1936, was originally named the Republic of China Constitution Draft. Newspapers simplified it as the "May Fifth Constitution Draft" for convenience, but this was not the legal name. It seems appropriate to maintain the legal name and should not add words such as "May Fifth Constitution Draft Amendment" in parentheses. Regarding the Mongolian banner issue raised by Committee Member Wu Yunpeng, Sun said that under Article 5 of the constitutional draft, "All ethnic groups in the Republic of China are equal," the resolution of the Political Consultative Conference was originally followed to add "Minority ethnic groups living in a certain area shall have their autonomy protected." Later, the President believed that the treatment of large and small ethnic groups should be equal and should not be specifically pointed out, so this clause was deleted. Articles 26 and 27 of the constitutional draft's National Assembly chapter, "The National Assembly shall be organized by the following representatives," were originally: (1) Legislators directly elected by various provinces and ethnic autonomous regions, (2) Supervisory committee members elected by various provincial councils and ethnic autonomous region assemblies. After research, the term "ethnic autonomous region" was considered too broad. Strictly speaking, the mainland is also an "ethnic autonomous region." At the same time, there is an interpretation of the term that refers to Mongolia and Tibet. Why not directly change it to the Mongolian leagues and Tibet? Hence, the current regulations exist. Sun continued, when the Central Standing Committee discussed the case at its 46th meeting, new opinions were also raised, and some advocated amendments. In the end, it was decided that because the case would still be submitted to the National Assembly, no amendments would be made to the articles at that time, and it was passed in principle and submitted to the Legislative Yuan for review. The intention of the Central Standing Committee was also that it was not necessary to amend the articles in a day and a half. They hoped that the entire case would be passed without amendments to complete the legal procedures and then submitted to the National Government for submission to the National Assembly for discussion. If the committee members had any opinions on the content of the constitution, if they were also representatives of the National Assembly, they hoped to raise them at the National Assembly. If they were not representatives of the National Assembly, they could entrust representatives of the National Assembly to submit written opinions. There seemed to be ample time in the National Assembly for discussion. After speaking, he submitted the resolution made by the joint review meeting on the 22nd for voting. All the legislators shouted in unison: "No objection," "No objection." This most important bill in the history of the Legislative Yuan, which is also the most important "Republic of China Constitution Draft Amendment" in the history of Chinese constitutional drafting, was passed in a chorus of "no objection."</p>

<h3>Review of the Constitutional Draft Passes Through Joint Committee</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing 22nd Dispatch] The Republic of China Constitution Draft Amendment has been passed by the joint review committee of the five committees of the Legislative Yuan on the morning of the 22nd, following the resolutions of the Central Standing Committee, and submitted to the plenary session of the Legislative Yuan for public decision. After the plenary session of the Legislative Yuan passes it at 4:00 p.m. on the 22nd, the legislative process will be completed. The joint review committee began at 9:30 a.m. with more than 50 legislators present, chaired by Lin Bin. He first explained the proceedings of the constitutional draft review meetings on the 18th and 19th and pointed out that representatives of the government had expressed opinions on the organization and powers of the National Assembly, the relationship between the legislature and the executive, the issue of the power of consent, and the local system during the meetings. Next, he explained the differences between the final amendments made to the constitutional draft by the constitutional draft review committee and the revised draft compiled by Wang Chonghui and others based on the principles of the Political Consultative Conference. The most important of these was the addition of Article 45, "The President may convene a meeting of the heads of the relevant Yuan to resolve disputes between Yuan, except as otherwise provided in this Constitution." This article was originally stipulated in the May Fifth Constitution Draft, and it is now restored to increase the connection between the Yuan. Another Article 57 was added, "The heads of the various ministries and commissions of the Executive Yuan and the political committee members not in charge of ministries and commissions shall be appointed by the Government upon the nomination of the President of the Executive Yuan." In addition, a more important change was made in Chapter 111 of the chapter on the powers of the central and local governments, which was changed to "The following matters shall be legislated and implemented by the central government or delegated to the provinces and counties for implementation." In the revised draft, the word "county" was added under the word "province," and the first clause, "General Rules for Provincial and County Autonomy," was added to make up for the drawbacks of excessive provincial power. Finally, he reported on the proceedings of the 46th meeting of the Central Standing Committee to discuss the case and the President's hope for the Legislative Yuan's review of the case. After the report, he invited the committee members to express their opinions. Di Ying was the first to stand up, reporting on the proceedings of the last reception of the Mongolian petition representatives and explaining in detail the Mongolian representatives' hopes for the constitution. Then, the committee members expressed their opinions on the amendment. Liu Butong and others were the most激烈, advocating not to discuss it. Chen Guyuan and others advocated "passing it in principle" without changing a single word in the content. Li Yuanbai believed that the amendment needed to be studied and should be amended, and advocated that all legislators participate in the National Assembly to discuss it. Chen Changheng advocated adding words such as "time is too short to review the content" to the resolution. Some legislators believed that there was a problem with the four words "passed in principle" because if so, the Legislative Yuan would bear the responsibility. The centrists put forward a new theory, that is, "passed in principle," but the wording should be carefully considered. Some legislators also offered opinions on the name of the constitution, advocating adding words such as "May Fifth Constitution Draft Amendment Draft" under the new name to indicate that the constitution was based on the May Fifth Constitution Draft. Li Qinglin, Situ De, and Tan Tiwu then put forward amendments on the content of the constitution. Li explained that all ethnic groups should achieve true equality, and suggested that in addition to ensuring that farmers have their land in the chapter on basic national policies, the right of herders to use land should also be guaranteed in the constitution. Situ De believed that the constitution ignored the land issue, and the chapter on basic national policies involving the economic system should be revised. Female legislator Tan Tiwu believed that the constitution should have concrete provisions on the equality of all ethnic groups and men and women. More than 30 people spoke, and the meeting was very lively. Sun Jiulu, Chen Guyuan, and others also submitted joint proposals. Finally, Lin Bin summarized the opinions of all parties and submitted them for voting, and the following resolution was passed by a majority of 34 votes: "The Republic of China Constitution Draft Amendment is proposed to be passed in accordance with the resolutions of the Central Standing Committee and submitted to the General Assembly (i.e., the plenary session of the Legislative Yuan) for public decision." The meeting adjourned at about 11:30 a.m. (According to the Legislative Yuan, the first review meeting was held on the 11th, and President Sun briefly reported on the revision process of the constitution. A joint meeting of the five committees was held on the 14th to listen to Wang Chonghui and Wu Jingxiong's report on the collation process. Due to the legislative procedure issue, no discussion was held at that time. A temporary forum was held on the 15th, and another review meeting was held on the 16th, which decided to discuss it again after the Central Standing Committee completed the supplementary procedures. The review meeting was passed today, and it has lasted for more than a decade, and the meeting has been held as many as five times).</p>

<h3>Liang Shuming Arrives in Chongqing</h3>

Wu did not want to admit it at first, and then smiled and said to the reporter: "Youchun (Li Huang's courtesy name) is my old friend of more than 20 years. He is currently suffering from brain disease and needs absolute rest. He really doesn't want outsiders to disturb his mood at this time." The reporter insisted on asking him to allow him to see Li once. Wu said: "I am sorry that I cannot do it from the standpoint of a doctor, but I can guarantee that Youchun has not disappeared and can recover his health in a short period of time. When he can see guests, I will notify your agency first."</p>

<h3>Xu Yongchang Returns to Nanjing</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping 22nd Dispatch] Xu Yongchang returned to Nanjing from Taiyuan on the 17th. People from Taiyuan said: After many twists and turns, Xu's trip was to discuss with Yan Xishan about serving as vice president or the head of one of the five Yuan after the implementation of constitutional government, because the reduction of provinces and regions is inevitable, and it is not appropriate to continue to serve as the chairman of a small province or region.</p>

<h3>China Democratic League to Host Reporters Tomorrow</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing 22nd Dispatch] The press conference originally scheduled to be held by the China Democratic League on the 22nd has been changed to the 24th. It is reported that the China Democratic League once intended to participate in the constitutional draft review committee, but was not invited, so it could not attend. Recently, Lei Zhen once again invited the League to form a delegation, but the League relapsed into its old ways, insisted on its views, and expressed its unwillingness to participate in the National Assembly.</p>

<h3>Amendment to the Executive Yuan Organization Law Passed by the Legislative Yuan for Review, the Ministry of Transportation Still Maintains the Original Name of the Ministry of Communications</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing 22nd Dispatch] The amendment to the Executive Yuan Organization Law has been passed by the Fourth Temporary Session of the West Legislative Yuan on the afternoon of the 22nd according to the review opinions. The biggest difference between the case and the draft amendment released the day before yesterday is that the Ministry of Transportation in the original draft has been changed back to the Ministry of Communications. Lin Bin, Chairman of the Legislative Yuan Legal System Committee, explained when reporting on the review process of the draft that the original text of the bill submitted by the Chairman was the Ministry of Transportation, but the draft amendment to the Executive Yuan Organization Law issued by the National Government was changed to the "Ministry of Communications" and stamped with a seal. The review believed that "Communications" was better than "Transportation", so the old name of the Ministry of Communications was maintained. There were also some other changes. After the report, Wei Tingsheng drafted a speech, advocating the abolition of the Chief Accountant of the Executive Yuan. Lin Bin explained that the Executive Yuan has been setting up a Chief Accountant for many years, and its affairs are also extremely busy. It seems that the opinions of the Executive Yuan should be consulted first, and this case seems to be passed temporarily according to the original proposal. Regarding whether a Chief Accountant should be set up, it seems that another case should be handled. Hong Ruizhao expressed opposition to the addition of ministries and commissions to the amended Executive Yuan Organization Law. He believed that the current amendment to the Organization Law has its environmental needs, but the current sudden increase of three or four ministries and commissions is a malignant expansion. The Ministry of Internal Affairs has nothing to do, and now it has changed the original business of the ministry to set up the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Land Administration, and the Ministry of Water Resources. The business of the Postal and Telecommunications Department of the Ministry of Communications was originally very clear, but now it has also changed the department to a ministry. This increase has not seen its balanced finance. Zhao Pei, Jian Guansan, and others did not think so. Jian's opposition was particularly fierce. Finally, Zhong Tianxin, with his usual calm mind, spoke, pointing out that only one Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications has been added this time, which cannot be said to be too much. Further, even if it is not due to the situation, there are sufficient reasons for changing water conservancy, land administration, and health to ministries, because after the end of the Anti-Japanese War, construction began. The above three businesses are of great importance to the welfare of the people, even if they cost more national treasury, it is not without good influence if they can be done well. Finally, it was submitted for voting and passed according to the review opinions.</p>

<h3>Anecdotes of the National Assembly</h3>
<p>— Our Reporter Zhang Ming</p>
<p>As soon as the reporters entered the venue today, they received invitations. When they opened them, they found that it was a reporter inviting reporters. The Capital News Reporters Association was inviting reporters from all over the country to Nanjing.</p>
<p>When the presidium gathered to go to the stage, Chairman Jiang was the first one, wearing a military uniform, standing in the center of the stage, always with a smile on his face. At this time, the mercury lamps shone in all directions, dazzlingly.</p>
<p>The second person to go to the stage with the chairman was Bai Chongxi, in military uniform with dazzling medals, shining brightly in the mercury lamps.</p>
<p>There were two women in the presidium, but Wu Yifang declined, so only Liu Hengjing was left, standing in the ranks of the presidium, looking particularly small and delicate.</p>
<p>Because of Wu Yifang's resignation from the presidium, and because the chairman announced Shao Lizitou's replacement, the female representatives were a little agitated. During the break, everyone gathered in groups, with some saying that if a woman resigns, a woman should replace her, and some saying how can her private resignation affect us women? While they were arguing, Hu Jianzhong walked over and said, "What's wrong, female representatives are going to riot?"</p>
<p>The only female chairman of the presidium, Liu Hengjing, came down from the stage and was surrounded twice, first for photos and then for autographs. The reporter asked her to say a few words, but she said, "I only have one sentence, there is only one woman among the 46 members of the presidium, which is too few?"</p>
<p>Shao Lizitou was announced to be replacing the presidium, but he firmly declined. When the gentlemen of the presidium went to the stage, he reported below, expressing his firm intention to decline. And he pointed to his head with his finger, probably meaning, "I always feel a headache." He declined the presidium because he had said before that he would not be the secretary-general or a member of the presidium.</p>
<p>There were many coughs in the venue, one after another, probably due to the change in temperature.</p>
<p>Minister Peng of the Central Propaganda Department entered the venue and sat in the last seat in the audience.</p>
<p>The three representatives who resigned from the chairmanship of the presidium were all from Zhejiang. Zhejiang representative Wu Wangji said: "I am embarrassed to say."</p>
<p>The reason for Wu Yifang's resignation from the presidium was that school affairs were busy. Chen Lifu said himself that he was "short of talent and busy with affairs." Shao Lizitou, however, "often feels a headache." Chen Cheng's intention to resign was very firm, and Gu Zhenggang wanted to stand up and say a few words of retention, but Chen Cheng repeatedly bowed to him, asking him not to say anything.</p>
<p>After the chairman announced that someone had resigned, these three or even four figures immediately became the target of everyone, and at the same time, they also seemed quite active in this moment.</p>
<p>The order in the venue on the 22nd was very good because there was no discussion of events and there was nothing to argue about.</p>
<h3>Sun Baogang and Others Arrive in Nanjing from Beiping, the Social Democratic Party Immediately Nominates a List and Expresses Satisfaction with Chairman Chiang's Reply</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing 22nd Dispatch] Sun Baogang, Wan Renqian, and Ye Duyi, members of the Central Standing Committee of the Social Democratic Party, arrived in Nanjing from Beiping at 2:00 p.m. on the 22nd. They immediately reported to Zhang Junmai on the internal consultations of the party in the north. Jiang Yuntian visited Lei Zhen for a long talk in the evening. It is learned that the copies of the letters exchanged between the Long Social Democratic Party and the government were delivered yesterday. The Social Democratic Party expressed great satisfaction with the President's reply, because the various opinions put forward by the party to the government have been fulfilled as desired and have been guaranteed. However, the list of National Assembly representatives of the party had already been drafted and may be submitted on the 23rd. It is also heard that in the Social Democratic Party's letter to the President, in addition to reorganizing the government, fulfilling the four promises, implementing the military reorganization plan, and withdrawing party groups from schools, it also advocated a thorough ceasefire and resumption of talks with the Communist Party, following the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, and convening a comprehensive group to seek the unification of the country. A certain person in the Social Democratic Party optimistically believes that if the government can do the above points, the Communist Party may also participate in the National Assembly. Regarding the fact that Qiang Junli did not participate in the National Assembly, it was because he believed that he must maintain a third-party position to mediate between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. According to the documents exchanged on the 23rd, the Central Propaganda Department may hold a press conference to announce them, and the list of representatives may also be submitted immediately after the documents are announced.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping 22nd Dispatch] Social Democratic Party representatives Sun Baogang and Ye Duyi left Beiping for Nanjing at 8:30 a.m. on the 22nd. Wan Renqian, a well-known figure in the Northeast Social Democratic Party, accompanied them. Sun and Ye told people before leaving that they would report the opinions from Beiping to the headquarters. The Social Democratic Party's participation in the National Assembly will have to wait for a final decision after concentrating opinions from all parties. They believe that the Social Democratic Party will not split due to the issue of participating in the National Assembly. Whether the Social Democratic Party participates in the National Assembly or not, they personally will not participate in the National Assembly. After the National Assembly, they will return to the north again and go to the Northeast. Wan Renqian told people before leaving that he would ask Mr. Zhang Junli and the headquarters of the Social Democratic Party to carefully consider the issue of participating in the National Assembly. On the 22nd, more than 500 members of the Beiping Social Democratic Party held a general meeting at Tang Xiangming's residence at 6:00 p.m. to discuss the election of National Assembly representatives. It is heard that the Beiping district of the Social Democratic Party has been allocated five National Assembly representatives, and Tianjin three. On the 22nd, both Beiping and Tianjin held meetings to elect double the number of candidates, and the headquarters was asked to circle them.</p>

<h3>Military Mediation Department Loses Function, Group Representatives All Withdraw</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 22nd] Although there are no instructions to abolish the Military Mediation Department itself and the Changchun branch, all groups stationed in other locations have completely lost their function as of the evening of the 22nd. The Communist representatives in the government areas and the government representatives in the Communist areas have now completely withdrawn from their stationed locations.

<h3>Ten Legislators Discuss the Revised Draft Constitution (I)</h3>
<p>— Our Newspaper Reporter Yu Zhenji</p>
<p>Since Wang Chonghui, Wu Jingxiong, and Lei Zhen used the May 5th Draft Constitution as a basis, and organized and established the "Revised Draft of the May 5th Draft Constitution" based on the principles of the Political Consultative Conference and the principles of modification by the Comprehensive Conference and the Constitution Drafting Committee, all parties have attached great importance to it. The comments made have also been inconsistent. Some even believe that modifying the May 5th Draft Constitution is to stray far from the Three People's Principles and the spirit of the Five-Power Constitution. During the review talks held by the Legislative Yuan earlier, the legislators also had fierce debates. The revised draft has recently been subject to the final review by the Constitution Drafting Committee, in which the connection between the five Yuans and the appointment of the heads of the Executive Yuan and various ministries have been further improved. It has been passed by the 46th meeting of the Central Standing Committee and sent to the Legislative Yuan to complete the legislative procedures, and then sent to the National Assembly as a draft for constitution-making. When the Legislative Yuan held a joint review meeting of the five committees on the morning of the 22nd, the case was passed in accordance with the resolution of the Central Standing Committee. In the afternoon, the full session of the Yuan also passed it, and the legislative procedures have been completed, so it can be transferred to the National Assembly for discussion.</p>
<p>Constitution-making is the sole task of this National Assembly, and the revised draft will be the basis for constitution-making. Its importance in the history of constitution-making in our country is self-evident. The criticisms from various parties are so divergent. To this end, the reporter specially visited legislators Lin Bin, Chen Changheng, Zhang Zhaoyuan, Chen Guyuan, Li Chenxue, Zhong Tianxin, Chen Xiaocen, Chuan Tongxian, Zhao Jiuchuan, Chen Hong, etc., to make an objective comparison of the revised draft and the original May 5th Draft Constitution from the perspectives of academic theory and national conditions. The opinions of each legislator are summarized below in order of the revised draft. (Note: Most of the interviews were conducted before the meetings of the Constitution Drafting Committee on the 18th and 19th. For the main points of modification by the Review Committee, please refer to this newspaper on the 20th):</p>
<p>What Kind of Republic is China?</p>
<p>The revised draft changed Article 1 of the general outline of the May 5th Draft Constitution, "The Republic of China is a Republic based on the Three People's Principles," to "The Republic of China is based on the Three People's Principles, and is a democratic republic of the people, by the people, and for the people." This motion caused an uproar in the Legislative Yuan. Di Ying believed that Lincoln's three principles of of the people, by the people, and for the people did not include the entire Three People's Principles, and that listing foreign creeds in our country's constitution seemed inappropriate. Zhang Zhaoyuan also believed that it had the fault of misattributing something. Chen Guyuan believed that "of the people, by the people, and for the people" was not exactly equal to "nationalism, democracy, and people's livelihood," but believed that the point was not overly important. Zhong Tianxin believed that such a provision did not immediately mean that it was contrary to the Three People's Principles, and that the two were not much different in essence. He himself once said that the purpose of the Three People's Principles was in the people, by the people, and for the people. However, from a legislative point of view, the revised draft seemed slightly tautological. Other members of the committee did not attach much importance to this.</p>
<p>Territorial Issues Worth Paying Attention To</p>
<p>According to the provisions of the May 5th Draft Constitution, the territory of our country is of an enumerated nature, and its changes must be decided by the National Assembly. Due to the current situation, the revised draft only makes a general provision for the territory, and its changes do not need to be decided by the National Assembly, and can be changed according to law. Most members of the committee felt that this provision was inappropriate.</p>
<p>Li Qingao believed that: The phrase "according to its inherent territory" is too vague, and suggested adopting the methods of other countries, using astronomical points to stipulate the longitude and latitude lines. If this point cannot be done, it should also use the enumeration method. Zhong Tianxin's view is: The drafters of the revised draft must have believed that since the legislators will be elected by the people, the Legislative Yuan composed of representatives of the people can deal with this issue. The drafters must also believe that since the Legislative Yuan has the power to discuss and decide on treaty cases, treaties will inevitably involve territory, so the provision in the territory article is "cannot be changed except in accordance with the law," instead of stipulating that it must be decided by the National Assembly.</p>
<p>Both people believe that territory is extremely important to national relations, and it seems reckless to change it only according to law. They all advocate following the original provisions of the May 5th Draft, that the territory of the Republic of China shall not be changed without the decision of the National Assembly. However, Mr. Chen Guyuan believes that enumeration is too rigid, and the current provisions have their own hard work, and generalization is better than enumeration.</p>
<p>Article 5 of the revised draft stipulates: "All nationalities of the Republic of China are equal." Li Qingao believes that although this article stipulates this, it is actually not done. He used the basic national policy as an example, stating that Article 136 stipulates: "The state shall enable tillers to have their land, laborers to have their jobs, and entrepreneurs to have opportunities for development, in order to seek the equality of national economy and people's livelihood." As far as the Han people are concerned, after "tillers have their land," their people's livelihood can be guaranteed. But what about pastoralists? What if "tillers have their land" and encroach on the pastures of pastoralists? The various problems in our country's past on the periphery were often caused by tillers encroaching on the pastures of pastoralists. Since it is called all nationalities are equal, why are the guarantees that pastoralists and even fishermen should receive not included in the Constitution? As far as the country is concerned, not all land is pastoral land. Li advocated changing the article to "those who have the ability to use land should retain their land." In this way, tillers, pastoralists, and fishermen will all receive the guarantees they deserve, and it can be said that the phrase "all nationalities are equal" has been truly achieved.</p>

<h3>Japanese Fishing Boats Unauthorizedly Cross Restricted Area, Found More Than 100 Li North of Taiwan, Hope Government Urges MacArthur Headquarters to Pay Attention</h3>
<p>[City News] According to the Fishing Management Office of the Executive Yuan: On the 25th of last month, four Japanese hand-operated net fishing boats were suddenly found about 120 li north of the province (122 degrees 47 east longitude, 22 degrees 47 north latitude). They were seen by our fishing boat "Jie Chong Te Bo Ai". The westernmost of the Japanese fishing boats on that day had the words "Fukuda Maru No. 86" on the stern, which is a Shimonoseki boat with a green hull and red deck, carrying crew members in old Japanese army uniforms. It was found that the boat, etc., sailed from Nagasaki, and caught one box each of sea bream and red ladyfish at the time. It was found that the MacArthur Headquarters of the US occupation forces originally restricted Japanese fishing boats to fishing within 30 nautical miles of the country, and later relaxed it to 90 nautical miles, but now the Japanese fishing boats have invaded 400 nautical miles away from Taiwan. It is hoped that our government can pay attention to it and urge the MacArthur Headquarters to pay attention, it is said.</p>
<h3>The Political Conference of the Pacification Zone Decided to Implement the Land Reform Plan and Promote Cooperative Movement in the Recovered Areas</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Nanjing, 22nd] A senior official told the Associated Press today that the Political Affairs Committee meeting of the Pacification Zone, held by the government to deal with the recovered areas, closed yesterday. The meeting passed a "more revolutionary" land reform, as well as various measures related to relief, education and economic cooperation. The official also said: The meeting decided to set up four experimental zones in Huaiyin, Huai'an, Taixing and Taixian to implement the government's new land reform plan in accordance with the points indicated by Chairman Chiang in his opening remarks. The Political Affairs Committee meeting of the Pacification Zone was presided over by President Song and Minister Bai. It is said that the drafting of the plan has begun. General Fu Zuoyi said at the meeting yesterday that the Communist Party has failed not only militarily, but also politically and economically, and that all that remains is the party's doctrine, but it has now begun to waver. He said: Land reform will be implemented in three stages: (1) Farmers will continue to cultivate the land distributed by the Communist Party, but ownership will be returned to the original owners. This point also applies to landlords who are not in the local area. The previous rule of returning land to the original landlords was limited to 50 mu, but this rule has been abandoned, but some government officials still insist on retaining this limit. The official also said: This issue will be left to the Political Affairs Committee of the Pacification Zone. (2) The government will handle land registration. (3) The government will implement the Father of the Nation's land policy, that is, to increase taxes so that landlords who do not cultivate will not be profitable, and to assist farmers in purchasing land. The person also said: President Song has approved the allocation of 900 million yuan for relief in the recovered areas, but the Political Affairs Committee meeting of the Pacification Zone did not stipulate a detailed plan. It is said that this issue will be left to the relevant government departments and provincial authorities to decide. The meeting decided to promote the cooperative movement in the recovered areas. In addition, it was decided that the Executive Yuan should pay 100 million yuan to the newly established Central Cooperative Bank as soon as possible. It is said that Chairman Chiang had previously agreed to pay this amount to the bank as working capital, but so far, President Song has only paid 200 million yuan. The meeting also passed a resolution to start repairing all destroyed schools. There are no special provisions for the new curriculum.</p>

<h3>Truth About Soviet Employees of the China Changchun Railway Requesting Repatriation: All Are Sick or in Dire Straits</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 22nd] Regarding the matter of Soviet employees of the China Changchun Railway in Shenyang, who are sick and living in difficult circumstances, requesting repatriation, the reporter specially investigated the truth from the China Changchun Railway as follows: The China Changchun Railway is more than 2,000 kilometers long. Since the Soviet army withdrew from the Northeast, we have taken over only more than 600 kilometers. This has caused the road's income and expenditure to be out of balance, with huge monthly losses, all borne by our national treasury. Although the road has tried its best to rectify the situation, the situation has improved slightly, but due to the unstable situation, the treatment of Chinese and Soviet employees cannot be improved temporarily, and the work of employees cannot return to normal. The situation of Chinese employees is indeed difficult. Under this pitiful situation, the Soviet side requested that some of its Soviet employees in Shenyang who are sick, have difficulty living, and have less work be transferred back to the Soviet Union. We expressed our intention to keep them and have tried our best to improve the treatment of negative workers. We also gave preferential medical expenses to Soviet employees who are sick. After several consultations with the Soviet side, our government finally agreed to the Soviet side's request. For Soviet employees who are sick, have simpler jobs, and have difficulty living, we temporarily allowed them to return to the Soviet Union, and our government provided them with transportation convenience, ordering the railway bureau to prepare a car to send them to Tianjin, take a Soviet ship to return to the country, and give them return travel expenses at its discretion. As for the remaining 100 or so Soviet employees, they are still staying on the road and working as usual.</p>

<h3>Editorial: Wishing the National Assembly's Constitution-Making to See the Big Picture!</h3>
<p>Since the National Assembly opened on the 15th, it has been in the preparatory meeting process for a week. Now that the presidium has been selected, and the amendment to the draft constitution has been solemnly passed by the Central Standing Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang and submitted to the Legislative Yuan to complete the procedures, the Legislative Yuan is currently reviewing and discussing it yesterday, and it should be able to complete its legislative procedures soon. It can be seen that the National Assembly will enter the stage of formal sessions starting next week.</p>
<p>Although this National Assembly was produced amidst great hardship and tribulation, judging from the signs of the past week, one cannot but acknowledge that it is a cradle for fostering a new political atmosphere in China. What we call a new political atmosphere is one of mutual respect and tolerance. We resolutely oppose resolving problems on the battlefield and advocate deciding everything in the parliament. Only in this way can we see a parliament that encompasses various opinions, and allow it to be delighted to hear a parliament that can truly integrate, compromise, and appropriately determine what to adopt and what to discard. This National Assembly, thanks to the central authorities' foresight, tolerance, and forbearance, has indeed set an example of a new political atmosphere. In addition to the Kuomintang, the Youth Party and social elites participated first, and now the Democratic Socialist Party will also participate. Moreover, the majority of representatives elected by the people of the whole country and overseas Chinese, regardless of their party affiliation or lack thereof, have all come together from afar, which is already commendable. Although the Chinese Communist Party and the Democratic League have not yet expressed their participation, the National Assembly not only still reserves seats for their representatives, but also reserved seats for their participation in the presidium yesterday. It can be seen that all the representatives of the National Assembly sincerely hope that this great meeting will be a meeting that reflects various opinions from all over the country, which is especially the ultimate expression of a good political atmosphere. In addition, outside of the National Assembly, the Central Standing Committee of the Kuomintang and the Supreme National Defense Council recently passed amendments to the Organic Law of the National Government and the Organic Law of the Executive Yuan, fully demonstrating the spirit of abiding by the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference. The Kuomintang, as the ruling party, has such magnanimity of "everything for the public," which is truly the most powerful guarantee for the Republic of China to embark on the road to democracy. As long as all participating parties can promote the new political atmosphere of "everything for the public," we believe that the constitution-making endeavor will surely have a satisfactory outcome.</p>
<p>Speaking of constitution-making, we can only appeal to the representatives of the National Assembly to broaden their minds and see the big picture. The constitution is the fundamental law of the country, and constitution-making is the greatest task of the people. Great undertakings naturally require bold strokes. With a congress of two thousand people, representing all ethnic groups, regions, occupations, parties, and social classes of the country, if the representatives do not have a broad vision of the entire country, do not have a broad mind to encompass the entire nation, consider the interests of the whole, and consider the descendants of future generations, but only focus on the local, think about the small self, argue endlessly over trivial details, then judging from the preparatory meeting situation in the past week, I am afraid that the approximately 140 or 50 articles may not be completely and flawlessly discussed in a year and a half. This is not what the people of today expect. We are not saying that the representatives of the National Assembly can act carelessly, but we must firmly request the representatives of the National Assembly to start with a broad brush.</p>
<p>Although democratic politics seems to be a waste of time, we must always hope that in the process of learning democratic politics, time will not be wasted excessively! Democratic politics is certainly a politics that welcomes debate, but we must ensure that everyone, in the process of learning democratic politics, truly debates on the topic within the scope permitted by the rules of procedure, and reduces irrelevant disputes over minor issues. Most of the representatives of the National Assembly come from the people and have their own professions. Those who belong to the party and government authorities bear the heavy responsibility of politics and military affairs for the central and local governments. If they prolong the meetings in the National Assembly and argue endlessly, what will be the impact on politics? What will be the public's perception? We sincerely hope that the representatives of this National Assembly can see the big picture, and in the major key points of the constitution, that is, the essence of the political and economic system, everyone will earnestly discuss without letting go, in order to reach a compromise and consistent conclusion, and establish a foundation for the long-term stability of the country. As for the wording of the articles, let the experts who are skilled in legislative technology take more responsibility for reviewing and organizing them. As for the details and minor matters, we fundamentally do not advocate making cumbersome regulations in the constitution. Gentlemen, you must know: As long as the people can truly "be the masters" in a democracy, and as long as the government can truly "implement the constitution" in constitutionalism, the constitution is originally nothing more than a grand law that the people and the government throughout the country jointly abide by and implement. Rather than being cumbersome, difficult to handle, and obstructive, why not first choose its major points at this time and solemnly stipulate them? So that every word and sentence in the constitution is something that everyone is willing to sincerely abide by and follow.</p>
<p>So, what are the big issues in the constitution? The representatives of the National Assembly must be able to see them, so there is no need to say more. At this time, we would like to offer one point first, which is the issue of the size of government power. Mr. Sun Yat-sen, the founding father of the nation, had already said that we want to enable "the people to have power and the government to have ability." He also said that Western democratic countries, on the one hand, hope that the government is omnipotent, and on the other hand, fear that the government is omnipotent. In view of this, he created the five-power constitution. Its true essence lies not in the separation of the five powers, but in the checks and balances between "political power" and "governing power." In other words, he advocated that the people only need to have the four major political powers of election, recall, initiative, and referendum to control the "people" and "laws" of the government. After the government is elected and takes office, it should be allowed to fully exert the "ability" of its five "governing powers" to benefit the people. Those who are not capable should be "recalled," and those who have bad "laws" should be "referendumed." It is enough for the people to have this great power, and there is no need for elected representatives to pull the government's sleeves every day, making it unable to move, and taking it as a pleasure. This is Mr. Sun Yat-sen's great invention after a lifetime of studying the laws and institutions of various countries, and it is the true essence of the five-power constitution! If this point is forgotten, and only following in the footsteps of others, focusing only on restraining the administrative organs, whether it is a cabinet system or a presidential system, or what the current trend calls a disguised cabinet system or a disguised presidential system, no matter what tricks are changed or what coats are worn, they will all deviate from Mr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings. The United Kingdom and the United States are advanced democratic countries, their people are accustomed to democracy, their national power is already abundant, and their political systems have been established for a long time. Regardless of whether the constitution is written or unwritten, they can use it freely and have achieved great results. It does not matter much if the government's actions are slow. However, emerging countries with vast territories and populations, accumulated habits, and awaiting transformation, such as today's China, are in a world of constantly changing situations. How can we quickly catch up and actively build the country? Of course, it is okay to borrow from others, but we cannot completely copy the established rules of the United Kingdom and the United States. We hope that everyone will be calm, look around the world, focus on reality, and formulate a constitution that is more suitable and feasible for the Republic of China.</p>
<p>Finally, we would like to ask the representatives of the National Assembly to especially think about how this constitution can be implemented and how it can make everyone willing to follow it when making the constitution. They must never have the idea of making the constitution first and then thinking about revising it if it does not work at the beginning of making the constitution. To succeed in anything in the world, we must rely on a "sincere" character! "Sincerity is the end and the beginning of things; without sincerity, there is nothing." The National Assembly must seek to make the constitution truly feasible; this is sincerity, and this is the only key to the success of constitution-making!</p>

<h3>The Circumstances of the Murder Case in Shouxian Are Shocking: The County Magistrate Murders a Retired Military Officer; Zhang Zuoliu Has Been Detained After Accusations from All Sides</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Bengbu News] Recently, a county magistrate in northern Anhui was involved in a case of planting evidence out of personal grudge, designing to kill an innocent retired military officer. The deceased was Zhao Zipan, who had followed Commander Bai Wenwei of the 33rd Army as a battalion and regimental commander during the years of the Republic of China sixteen and seventeen. He also led troops to fight against the enemy during the Anti-Japanese War. After this shocking tragedy occurred, not only did it arouse public outrage among the people of Huaishang, but public opinion here was also greatly shocked. Everyone believed that officials were treating human lives so carelessly, and that the law was being disregarded and human rights were not guaranteed. The details obtained from the investigation are recorded as follows: Zhang Zuoliu, the county magistrate of Shouxian, is from Fengtai, northern Anhui, and graduated from Sun Yat-sen University in Guangzhou. He once founded the Huaimin Daobao in Huai. During the Anti-Japanese War, Zhao Zipan served as the captain of the First Battalion of the Twelfth Guerrilla Column of the Northern Anhui Garrison Headquarters, and as the deputy chief of the detachment of the Eighth Forward Column. Zhang Zuoliu, in the rear, once planned to transport a large amount of materials to the Bengbu area, which was occupied by the enemy, for sale. When passing through Zhao Zipan's defense zone, Zhao, fearing that he was aiding the enemy, stopped him. Zhang held a grudge because the materials could not pass.</p>
<p>Framed with Personal Grudge</p>
<p>After the victory, Zhang was appointed to a higher position. Last month, he fabricated a story that Zhao Zipan was colluding with bandits and falsely reported to the headquarters of the Eighth Pacification Zone, requesting his arrest and interrogation in Bengbu, which he succeeded in doing. At 2:00 p.m. on October 30th, Zhao Zipan was bathing in a bathhouse on Gongyuan Road in Shouxian City. Zhang Zuoliu learned of this and suddenly sent many armed soldiers to arrest Zhao and imprison him in the county government, forbidding him from communicating with anyone. When people from various agencies and organizations in Shouxian heard the news, they were very shocked. They jointly certified that Zhao had not committed any illegal acts and sent representatives to plead for his release. Zhang said that he was arresting and escorting Zhao to Bengbu on the orders of the headquarters of the Eighth Pacification Zone and refused bail.</p>
<p>Murdered En Route</p>
<p>At 5:00 p.m. on November 1st, the whole city was under martial law. Zhang Zuoliu sent eight armed soldiers with two long guns and six short guns to take Zhao Zipan out of the back door of the county government. Zhao was escorted to a boat at the North Gate amidst the sound of gongs. He also sent another team of armed soldiers to meet them by boat from the East Gate to escort Zhao to Bengbu. Unexpectedly, when they arrived west of Yabeipu in Pingshan Head (in Fengtai County, 20 miles from Shouxian), in the evening, soldiers shot Zhao to death. He was shot seven times, and there was a knife wound on his chest, which was very tragic. The next morning (2nd), the escorts hired a civilian boat from Tianjia'an and transported Zhao's body to Bengbu, reporting to the Pacification Headquarters that they had encountered bandits on the way and exchanged fire, causing Zhao to be injured and killed. They also requested an autopsy, which was completed and photographed. The deceased's son, Zhao Mingliang, and daughter, Zhao Mingying, rushed to the scene upon hearing the news and purchased a coffin to hastily prepare the body for burial.</p>
<p>Appeals from All Sides</p>
<p>Zhao Mingliang and his sister were extremely saddened by the inexplicable murder of their father and appealed to people from Shouxian living in Bengbu for help in seeking justice. Liu Huaxuan, a scholar from Shouxian living in Bengbu, convened an emergency meeting of his fellow villagers at the Shouxian, Dingyuan, and Fengtai Fellow Villagers Association on the evening of the 7th. Everyone who attended was indignant. They elected Liu Huaxuan, Peng Zhuoru, Hu Xichou, Yue Xiangru, and Zhu Zhuoren to visit Commander Xia Wei at the Pacification Headquarters on the morning of the 8th to report the truth and details of the Zhao case. Commander Xia Wei was very surprised and promised to send someone to investigate. Subsequently, Sun Qingang, the speaker of the Shouxian County Council, went directly to Hefei from Shouxian to report to the provincial government and request a thorough investigation. Zhang Qingchuan, the director of the Shouxian branch of the Three Principles of the People Youth League, also went to Beijing to appeal. Zhao Mingying, the deceased's daughter, went to Hefei from Bengbu on the 10th to appeal to Chairman Li of the provincial government about her grievances. The Shouxian, Dingyuan, and Fengtai Fellow Villagers Association in Bengbu also sent representatives to go.</p>
<p>Detention Warrant</p>
<p>After receiving the report, Anhui Chairman Li Pinsian was extremely angry at Zhang's disregard for human life and issued a hand-written order to the First District Commissioner's Office to detain Zhang and escort him to the province for strict handling. The Commissioner's Office obeyed the order and immediately detained Zhang Zuoliu. He was escorted to Hefei on the 18th to be sent to the provincial government for investigation.</p>

<h3>New Recruits in Pinghu Enlist; Lottery Completed in Dangtu</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Pinghu News] The first enlistment of new recruits in this county was held solemnly on the 18th. The county sent 25 new recruits this time. After the regimental management office checked their physical condition, 5 were unqualified, and 20 were actually recruited.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Qingpu News] The draftees selected by lottery in various districts of this county were gathered in the urban area on the 20th, totaling more than 500 people. The military medical officer sent by the Songjiang Regiment Management District has arrived in the county and will examine the physical condition of the draftees on the 21st. The quota for military service in this county is 250 people.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Dangtu News] This county has been ordered to recruit 730 new recruits, and the lottery has now been completed in various townships. They are being sent to the county government for concentration and then handed over to the Xuancheng Regiment Management District Command for acceptance.</p>
<h3>Six Thieves Escape from Prison in Chuansha</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Chuansha News] Due to the negligence of the guards, at about 2:00 a.m. on the 20th, six thieves suddenly escaped from a prison cell in the detention center of the judicial office of this county. They were Zhang Genfu, Pan Xiaofang, and Cai Zhanqing, who had been sentenced to death, Zhang Jinsheng, who had been sentenced to ten years of imprisonment, Qian Zhongda, who had been sentenced to five years of imprisonment, and Cao Fuchang, a thief who was on trial. When the guards discovered this, they immediately reported it to the police and pursued them, but there was no trace of them. After inspection, it was found that the prisoners had dug a hole in the ground of the cell, passed through the walls of a small alley, and escaped outwards through a bamboo fence circle owned by a Mr. Song. The hole was more than ten feet long, and it was very difficult to dig. It could not have been completed in a day or two, and it was even more difficult without the use of iron tools. The entrance of the hole in the cell was conveniently covered by a bed, so the guards did not notice it beforehand. It was also heard that the prisoners all had shackles on their feet, but they had all been removed before escaping and left in the cell.</p>
<h3>Nantong Security Team Stationed in Chuangang Town</h3>
<p>[Nantong News] Commander Zhang of the Zhangzhishan Security Brigade believed that the communist troops in Chuangang Town were trying to stir up trouble from time to time, which affected the security of the area. Moreover, the people of Chuangang were living in poverty. Therefore, he ordered Fan Kaifu, the captain of the First Company, to search and station troops there. The communist troops fled without a trace after hearing the news, only firing cold shots along the way. Chuangang Town was officially stationed on the 18th at 7:20 a.m. Because the advance was rapid and safe, the residents gathered along the road to welcome our troops.</p>
<h3>Wuxi, Chengjiang, Wujin, and Yuhang Cloth Factories Request Uniform Yarn Allocation</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Wuxi News] After the Shanghai Economic Department's Textile Industry Management Committee implemented the cotton yarn allocation system, the dyeing and weaving cloth factories in other areas outside Shanghai were not treated the same, which was threatened by the black market yarn. Under the imbalance between supply and demand, the cost of the cloth produced exceeded one-third of that in Shanghai, and the price difference was even greater. The factories in various places that have not been allocated will fall into stagnation. At 2:00 p.m. on the 21st, the Wuxi County Cloth Factory Industry Association, together with representatives from the cloth factory industries in Wujin, Changshu, and Jiangyin counties, totaling more than 20 people, held an emergency meeting in Wuxi. They decided to elect representatives to go to Shanghai to petition the Textile Management Committee and the relevant government authorities, requesting uniform yarn allocation to provide relief.</p>

<h3>Female Bandit Lu Asi Mei to Be Tried by Military Law Soon</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Suzhou, 22nd] Lu Asi Mei, one of the main culprits in the Daxieqiao Massacre in Fengqiao Town, Suzhou, was previously captured by the criminal police team and preliminarily interrogated by the police station.

<h3>Taihu剿匪Review: Elimination of Bandits and Security is Expected</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Suzhou, 12th] The second phase of the Jiangnan area剿匪plan, which began on November 1st, will soon reach its completion deadline at the end of November. The Taihu剿匪Headquarters specially met with our newspaper reporter on the 22nd to publish a conversation on the work situation of the past two months, which is briefly recorded as follows: Taihu Lake covers 36,000 hectares and spans Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. Since the late Qing Dynasty, for more than 50 years, it has been a haven for bandits. After the victory, General Tang Enbo, in view of the rampant bandits in Taihu Lake, which was a hidden danger to the security of Jiangnan, specially ordered Chuan Jinfang and Liu Hongde to organize the Taihu area剿匪Headquarters in Mudu. Since the middle of September, the work has been carried out. Based on the government's policy of leniency and not blaming the past, it first ordered Commissioners Jin Jiarang and Yang Yanbin to carry out the work of appeasement. According to statistics, from October to the present, the bandits who have returned to the government include Liao Bingnan and Pu Fulin's troops, who were based in Taihu Lake, Mao Yunxiang and Zeng Junfeng's troops, who disturbed the Sunan and Lubei areas, Gu Fuxing's troops, who stole into the Xinan area, and Xu Jintang's troops, who were active in the rural areas of Binhu, totaling about a thousand people, bringing back more than ten machine guns, more than three hundred rifles, and more than a hundred short guns. These personnel who have reformed themselves are waiting to be compiled and trained. As for the stubborn bandits such as Li Defu, Hui Yusheng, and Liu Senlin, they have all been wiped out. Currently, the remaining bandits in the Taihu Lake area include Xue Yonghui, Zhou Zhimin, and Qin Dagang's three troops, who are still disturbing the Baima Lanshi Jinqiao area in the Yangshan area. However, according to reliable information, the actual strength of the three bandits is only one light machine gun and more than ten rifles. Therefore, the bandits are isolated and it is not difficult to wipe them out in one fell swoop. In the future, the security of Taihu Lake can be guaranteed, the farmers in Binhu can rest easy, and merchants and travelers can also be fearless.</p>
<h3>The Grand Canal Work Relief Bureau to Close at the End of the Month</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Yangzhou News] The Grand Canal Engineering Work Relief Bureau of the Suning Sub-office of the Aftermath Relief Administration once formulated various work relief plans and organized three large teams to survey and estimate the various projects to be done along the Grand Canal. After the national army opened up the Grand Canal line, there was no obstacle. The touch stated that the responsibilities had ended and would be closed at the end of November. All unfinished projects will be handed over to the Jiangbei Grand Canal Engineering Bureau to be responsible for handling.</p>
<h3>Suppression of Rickshaws, Prohibition of Wheelbarrows</h3>
<p>Rural Areas of Northern Jiangsu Affected</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Rugao News] This year, rickshaws are banned in Beijing, Shanghai, and Hankou, and wheelbarrows will also be banned in the mainland. The reason is that wheelbarrows damage the road surface of highways. The county government has received an order from the province to transfer the order to investigate and ban them. However, rickshaw and wheelbarrow pullers are a side industry for the people of northern Jiangsu during the slack farming season. In the future, during the slack farming season, the villagers will not be able to pull rickshaws to Shanghai or push wheelbarrows in the countryside. This will have a significant impact on the rural economy.</p>
<h3>Qiantang River Water Conservancy Project Decided to Be Completed in Four Phases</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Haining News] After the Qiantang River Water Conservancy Project Bureau invited Chinese and foreign water conservancy experts to discuss the results, it has now been decided to complete it in four phases, each phase lasting one year. The first phase of the project is the one currently underway in various sections, with an estimated cost of 6 billion. The second phase includes (1) the Haining Chengming Stone Embankment (150 meters of project), (2) the Haining Du·Shi·Gao·Li·Zhong Stone Embankment (250 meters of project), (3) the Haining Dan to Dai Stone Embankment project (360 meters of project), and (4) the Xiaoshan Wenjia Weir Stone Embankment project (50 meters of project), with an estimated cost of 10,715,000,000 yuan. The third phase is the Xixing Diversion Dam (8,000 meters of project), with a budget of 16,200,000,000 yuan. The fourth phase is (1) the Hangzhou Diversion Dam project (1,000 meters), and (2) the Shunshui Dam project (14,000 meters), with a budget of 10,980,000,000 yuan. After the completion of these four phases of the project, the damage from collapse and tidal waves can be avoided without worry.</p>

<h3>Our Newspaper's Hangzhou Office Opens a Station for Spiritual Food</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Hangzhou News] Our newspaper's Hangzhou office originally erected a newspaper display board on the edge of the Sixth Park by the lake, and readers were crowded and unable to move. In view of this, the Hangzhou Municipal Engineering Bureau cooperated with our newspaper's office to establish a spiritual food station at the Sixth Wharf. The Engineering Bureau added a number of seats for readers to rest. Our newspaper's office also plans to add pictures and books to enrich the interior and provide readers with universal service.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou District Chief Election: Municipal Government Actively Preparing</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Hangzhou, 22nd] The Hangzhou Municipal Government is actively preparing for the election of district chiefs. It is learned that candidates participating in the election are going to the Civil Affairs Section to register. As of the 21st, there were more than 20 people, including five in District One, four in District Two, three in District Three, two in District Four, two in District Five, two in District Six, one in District Seven, and two in District Eight.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Hangzhou, 22nd] Only more than 2,000 kilometers of roads in Zhejiang Province are currently passable. Labor service will be launched at the end of this month, and construction will start throughout the province. The more than 2,000 kilometers that have not been restored can be repaired this winter, but only earthwork bridges require funding. The Executive Yuan has allocated 500 tons of flour, which will be distributed to designated routes. Director Yang said: The construction of Zhejiang roads relies entirely on the power of the people. The decision to lease Zhejiang roads is being put out to tender, but the price offered by commercial vehicles is too low. The Department of Transportation has indicated that it is not enough to maintain the roads, so it is difficult to succeed. However, the tendering method is still being drafted.</p>

<h3>Improving the Beijing-Shanghai Railway</h3>
<p>Following the publication in this column of Mr. Chen Liuli's article "Five Points to Contribute to the Railway Bureau," the Beijing-Shanghai Railway Administration has responded, stating: "(1) The train frequency on our railway is now greater than before the war, and the number of passengers has more than doubled. Therefore, apart from reserved seating, all other trains are extremely crowded, especially the fourth-class carriages. We will find ways to improve seating. Regarding passengers carrying commercial goods, our railway has strict restrictions. Large items must be handled as parcels and transported in the parcel car according to regulations. Small packages also require purchasing parcel tickets for carriage on board. Regarding passengers carrying chickens, ducks, fish, and crabs, we are currently formulating appropriate measures for prohibition. (2) The delays of our express trains averaged three hours and twenty-three minutes when we first took over. Recently, the average delay has been only nine minutes. After more than a year of effort, there has been significant improvement. As for delays of other ordinary passenger trains, there are many factors involved, and we are thoroughly researching improvements. (3) Each time we add passenger train services, we do so based on statistical figures of passenger numbers in each section of each month. Therefore, there is no impracticality. Regarding restoring the pre-war Beijing-Wuxi service, we have long considered this. However, the current level of passenger congestion between Beijing and Wuxi is far less than in other sections, so we can only proceed when there are sufficient vehicles. (4) All stations on our railway originally had waiting room facilities before the war, but many were destroyed during the war. Now, to reduce passenger suffering, we are planning to add waiting rooms to major passenger stations such as Nanjing, Zhenjiang, Changzhou, Wuxi, Suzhou, Shanghai, Jiaxing, and Hangzhou, and improve other facilities. (5) Due to a shortage of vehicles, our freight train services are already very limited. At this time of commercial recovery, various businesses urgently need goods to be transported. Our railway should strive to facilitate transportation to benefit people's livelihoods. The original letter suggested reducing freight train services and changing them to passenger services, which would be detrimental to one aspect while neglecting another. This would likely invite criticism from other quarters." We are publishing this to acknowledge the Railway Bureau's willingness to adopt good advice.</p>
<h3>Only Son Still Required to Serve in the Military</h3>
<p>Regarding the reader Li Yimin's previous letter inquiring about the ambiguity of conscription for only sons, we have received a reply from the Conscription Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense explaining: "Article 26, Paragraph 4 of the Military Service Law promulgated by the National Government on October 10, 1946 (which does not include provisions for deferment for only sons) states that 'those solely responsible for family livelihood without siblings, or with siblings who have all been conscripted or are all under the age of eighteen' may be granted deferred conscription during wartime, but not deferred enlistment during peacetime, and are still required to enter military service." Editor's Note: Regarding the issue of whether only sons should be required to serve in the military, many people have repeatedly sent letters appealing for consideration. This serves as a reply.</p>
<h3>Postal Reply</h3>
<p>Reply to Mr. Nie Zhicheng: Regarding your letter stating that Tinglin urgently needs relief, we have received a reply from the Su-Ning Branch of the National Relief and Rehabilitation Administration stating: "The distribution of relief goods by our office is based on the results of preliminary investigations conducted by the Relief and Rehabilitation Associations composed of gentry, charitable organizations, groups, and individuals enthusiastic about local public welfare in various counties. The allocation of materials and joint management are then carried out in conjunction with local individuals in each county. If that area has not received relief, and the situation is indeed as Mr. Nie describes in his appeal, we have instructed the county association to investigate and handle it. We are replying specifically to inform you of this." Special reply.</p>
<h3>Extra Notes on the Zhejiang Provincial Magistrate Examination</h3>
<p>— Our Reporter Huang XingTian</p>
<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Magistrate Examination has not been held for fifteen years since 1931. After Chairman Shen took office, he decided to hold one. It was initially scheduled for July, then changed to October, and later to November. However, enrollment remained unenthusiastic. Only seventy-three candidates actually took the examination. Their qualifications can be divided into: (1) those who passed the Higher Civil Service Examination, (2) those who passed the Zhejiang Provincial Special Examinations in previous years, (3) graduates of the Zhejiang Provincial Autonomous School and Financial Training Institute, and (4) graduates of the Central Political School. In terms of experience, there were secretaries and section chiefs from Commissioner's Offices and county governments, district chiefs, lawyers, judges, bank staff, and some who had worked in military supply stations and as political staff in the military.</p>
<p>The examination was divided into oral and written tests. The written test lasted for three days. The Chinese language section was set by Yu Shaosong, Director of the Zhejiang Provincial Gazetteer Office. In the question regarding the six "lians" (廉) from the Book of Rites (周禮), namely "incorruptibility in selecting the virtuous, the capable, the upright, the law-abiding, the respectful, and the diligent," almost none of the candidates knew the answers. The other subjects were not very difficult. As long as the Chinese was fluent and the general knowledge was rich, it was unlikely to submit a blank paper. The oral test was even more important. Director Ruan Yicheng of the Civil Affairs Department flew from Shanghai to Hangzhou from the National Assembly in Nanjing to handle this matter. During the oral test, all the examiners were divided into three groups: political, economic, and legal. Each group took turns to have one person speak, but all the examiners scored individually. Because each examiner's questions were different, the candidates inevitably had to rely on some luck. Old Mr. Yu complained a lot about the atmosphere among grain administration and tax personnel, so he would first give a lecture to candidates who had served or were currently serving in financial or grain positions. Director Chen Yingbao Lin did not forget about finance and asked questions about what to do when a magistrate took office and the county treasury was empty, the county council did not allow increasing the people's burden, and public school teachers petitioned for salary increases. These questions were precisely the difficulties that Director Chen himself was currently encountering, so he was not ashamed to ask. Director Ruan had a deep understanding of political and legal studies and had rich experience from ten years of service, so the questions he asked were penetrating and made it impossible for the candidates to use empty words. Moreover, he paid close attention to the wording and logic of the questions, and the respondents would be caught in contradictions if they were not careful.</p>
<p>In principle, the examiners were not allowed to express their attitude on the spot regarding whether they were satisfied with the candidates' answers. However, when the answers were too bizarre, they could not help but smile at each other. For example, when Director Chen asked a candidate what "guifei" (規費) and "tefu" (特賦) were, that future "parent official" frankly replied: "I have never eaten the financial rice (i.e., worked in finance), so I don't know." Some candidates were too nervous and stammered, unable to fully express themselves. Others spoke eloquently, as if they were presenting evidence in court or explaining the reasons for a proposal in parliament. Most candidates knew that Chairman Shen was hard of hearing in one ear, so they all spoke loudly. They also knew that Chairman Shen opposed apportionment and excessive taxes and valued farmland irrigation, so they all had a set of theories to support these two issues.</p>
<p>The oral test ended at noon on the 20th, and in the afternoon, the examiners reviewed the written papers. Because they were eager to announce the results, they all read until midnight before finishing. It is said that one paper had the following written on it: In the future, even if magistrates are elected, they must pass an examination to be eligible for election. This is truly far-sighted. However, there are still two magistrates from the first batch assigned to Zhejiang by the Examination Yuan who have not been assigned county positions, and the second batch of fifteen people have already reported to Hangzhou. In addition, there will be a magistrate qualification examination on the 22nd and 23rd of this month. Moreover, the Provincial Party Headquarters has been ordered to reduce staff, and Director Zhang also hopes that the Provincial Government can accommodate some of the laid-off personnel in county government positions. Therefore, the candidates are worried that the Provincial Government will not recruit too many, with most people thinking that it will take a maximum of only ten. Fortunately, most of the candidates currently have jobs, so even if they are not selected, they will still have something to do. If they are selected, they will have to enter the county administration research class of the Provincial Training Corps and study for a while before taking office.</p>

<h3>Britain and America Reduce Troops Stationed in Special Ports; Four Foreign Ministers May Reach Agreement; France Requests Postponement of Discussion on German Issue</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] San Francisco, 22nd Broadcast: Regarding the issue of special ports, an agreement is now possible. The Soviet side demands that British and American troops withdraw from special ports within a limited time. Byrnes has proposed a compromise, indicating that Britain and America are willing to reduce their troops stationed in special ports to a certain limit. Molotov is likely to accept this.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Special Correspondent in the United States, Washington, 22nd Special Dispatch] The Four Foreign Ministers Conference, which has reached a stalemate due to the issue of special ports, has been unable to complete the Five Satellite Countries Peace Treaty. US Secretary of State Byrnes today shifted his focus, suggesting to avoid the important and dwell on the trivial, and begin discussing the German Peace Treaty first, and then revisit the issue of the Japanese Peace Treaty. The convocation of this Foreign Ministers Conference conflicts with the date of the UN General Assembly, which is very unfortunate. The four powers originally planned to meet with Chinese representatives today to discuss the veto issue, but Molotov declined to attend the Five Foreign Ministers Conference on the pretext that he had to participate in the UN General Assembly meeting discussing the issue of troop stationing.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 22nd Dispatch] According to responsible sources, the French government has instructed its Deputy Foreign Minister Mouvieille, who is currently in New York, to request that the Four Foreign Ministers Conference not discuss the German issue before mid-January next year. France notified the three foreign ministers last month that as long as a provisional government is in power in France, it cannot thoroughly discuss this issue. Therefore, the French representative proposed postponing the discussion until January next year, at which time France's political structure would likely be clearer. At the same time, the French representative will request that any discussion on Germany at the New York Four Foreign Ministers Conference be limited to procedural issues.</p>
<h3>South African Federation Discriminates Against Indians; Gu Weijun Condemns; Voices Support for India's Complaint; Smuts Threatens to Withdraw from the United Nations</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Special Correspondent in New York, 21st Dispatch] The United Nations Political and Legal Committee met today, and our delegation leader Dr. Gu Weijun delivered a speech supporting India's opposition to the South African Federation's implementation of racial discrimination policies. Belarus, Ukraine, Yugoslavia, and Guatemala also advocated that this issue be fully discussed and handled jointly by the Political Security Committee and the Legal Affairs Committee. This morning, South African Prime Minister General Smuts issued a warning, claiming that if international institutions take any action against racial discrimination, the South African Federation may withdraw from the United Nations. Subsequently, Indian representative Mrs. Pandit made a moving appeal, advocating taking action against the South African Federation. Mr. Gu said: The parts of South African law concerning Indians are based on the principle of racial discrimination, which is indeed a fact, and General Smuts does not deny this point. However, this issue is not simply a domestic legal issue of one country, but involves world political dynamics. Due to the dispute between South Africa and India over this issue, the relationship between the two countries is already quite "tense," so the principles of the United Nations Charter should be used to handle it. Mr. Gu also said that in the past three years, China has repeatedly resolved to maintain contact with the South African government to seek the abolition of discrimination against Chinese people in that country. Smuts's claim that it is a domestic issue is inappropriate. Smuts's liberal and progressive ideas are admired by the world, and he should help resolve this matter. Soviet representative Gromyko said that his government had not yet decided on its position, and neither had the British representative.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Lake Success, New York, 21st Dispatch] South African Prime Minister Smuts, in the Political and Legal Committee, expressed his agreement to discuss India's complaint against South Africa's discrimination against Indians, but at the same time felt that the discussion should not involve the United Nations' right to interfere in internal affairs. He said that the status of Indians in South Africa does not require action by United Nations institutions. Article 2 of the United Nations Charter clearly stipulates that United Nations institutions shall not interfere in matters within the scope of the internal affairs of member states. Each country, under the principle of not harming the rights of other countries, may formulate its own living conditions and has jurisdiction over people and things within its borders. To avoid serious consequences, it seems appropriate for the International Court of Justice to interpret Article 2 of the Charter, rather than having United Nations institutions investigate prematurely, so as to avoid setting a bad precedent for interfering in internal affairs.</p>
<h3>British Prime Minister Announces Size of Army, Navy, and Air Force; Currently 1.385 Million</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 21st Dispatch] Prime Minister Attlee announced in the House of Commons today that the British armed forces will total 1,385,000 at the end of this December, 185,000 more than the target of 1.2 million announced this February. Due to the delayed conclusion of peace treaties, British troops stationed abroad have not been able to return as scheduled, so the repatriation target cannot be completed as scheduled.</p>
<h3>British Labor Government Regains Confidence; Conservative Party's Motion Against Nationalization of Industry Rejected by House of Commons</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 21st Dispatch] The House of Commons met today, and Minister of Commerce Cripps reported that the government will continue to implement its social programs. The Conservative Party proposed an amendment opposing the continued nationalization of major industries, which was rejected by a vote of 332 to 188. The Labor government has therefore gained another vote of confidence.</p>
<h3>Argentine Diplomatic Mission to Visit Moscow Next Month</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] San Francisco, 22nd Broadcast: The Argentine diplomatic mission is scheduled to fly to Moscow in early December. This is the first time the diplomatic mission has flown to the Soviet Union since 1917. It is reported that the Soviet side has expressed its welcome.</p>
<h3>France Plans to Establish Diplomatic Relations with India</h3>

<h3>Ukrainian Representative Robbed in Restaurant; Shot and Wounded in Leg</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, New York, 22nd Dispatch] UN General Assembly Ukrainian representative Steinick was dining with companions in a small restaurant in New York today when a thug suddenly broke into the store to rob it. Steinick was shot and wounded in the leg. According to Ukrainian delegation leader Manuilsky, this robbery was political in nature. He is conducting an investigation and will submit a report through appropriate channels. US delegation leader Austin has expressed his apologies to Manuilsky.</p>
<h3>Investigation of Troop Stationing Issue Sparks Fierce Debate; Differences of Opinion Among Countries; Compromise Requires Behind-the-Scenes Negotiations; Our Representative Supports US Amendment</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 21st Dispatch] Due to the different positions of the major powers, reaching a compromise agreement on the thorny issue of the United Nations member states stationing troops in non-enemy territories will likely require behind-the-scenes negotiations. Although the five powers unanimously agreed in principle to the Soviet proposal, they differed on how to implement it. The Soviet chair only needs to investigate the situation of troops stationed in foreign territories, while the United States believes that the investigation must include the situation of domestic troops. Our country has indicated that it is willing to support the US amendment if the United States formally proposes it. France proposed three points: (1) a general investigation of armed forces, (2) a proportional reduction of troops stationed abroad, and (3) the final transfer of certain strategic locations to the Security Council for handling. Britain believes that the "real problem" is disarmament, not obtaining information on troop situations, so it advocates considering the Soviet proposals for investigating troop stationing and disarmament together.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, New York, 21st Dispatch] The UN General Assembly Political and Security Committee continued its meeting today to discuss the issue of troops stationed abroad by various countries. Chinese representative Gu Weijun first delivered a speech stating that the Soviet proposal for an investigation plan had been amended by the United States, and China was prepared to accept it. The Chinese troops stationed in Burma and Vietnam have long since been withdrawn to their country. As for the US troops stationed in China, the number is very limited and has been agreed to by the Chinese government. The purpose is to cooperate with China to complete certain obligations regarding the repatriation of Japanese prisoners of war and the disarmament of the Japanese army. These US troops have not interfered in China's internal affairs. Their presence in China has not caused misunderstandings or friction between China and the United States, nor has it caused misunderstandings or friction between the US military and the Chinese people. Moreover, the number of US troops has been gradually reduced. We know that once the tasks agreed upon by China and the United States are completed, the US troops currently stationed in China can be completely withdrawn to the United States within an appropriate period. As for the Soviet proposal to investigate the troops of various countries stationed abroad, the Chinese government is prepared to accept it for two reasons: namely, (1) in accordance with Article 43 of the United Nations Charter, United Nations member states should provide the necessary troops to organize an international army to maintain international peace and security, so we want to implement this article, it is necessary for countries to provide information. (2) If the Soviet proposal can be supplemented by the US amendment, it will greatly facilitate the study of the issue of disarmament. For this reason, the Chinese delegation is willing to support the US amendment, that is, the information provided by each United Nations country on its troops should simultaneously include its domestic troops and troops stationed abroad.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Lake Success, 21st Dispatch] Foreign Secretary Bevin, during the debate on the Soviet Union's request for an investigation into foreign troops in the Political Committee today, stated that the British government's acceptance of this Soviet proposal is limited to the condition that the proposal is related to the issue of disarmament. Bevin indicated that if these two matters are mentioned together, he would be willing to support it. Before it can be determined whether the new agency is effective, Britain cannot take actions that might put its citizens in danger. Bevin further stated that Britain fully agrees with Molotov's disarmament proposal. He requested that the Political Committee provide the Military Staff Committee to the Security Council to establish a disarmament agency so that governments can know whether they can cede a large portion of their sovereignty to United Nations agencies. Before Bevin spoke, Molotov answered the questions raised yesterday by the British representative Cadogan, saying that the purpose of investigating the group's foreign troops was to facilitate the preparation of an agreement on troops available to United Nations agencies.</p>
<h3>Yoshida Cabinet Remains Firm; Believes It Should Not Hastily Dissolve the Diet</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Special Correspondent in Tokyo, 21st Dispatch] Although the opposition parties have launched a fierce political offensive, the Yoshida Cabinet remains in its original position and unmoved. However, when the extraordinary session of the Diet convenes on the 25th of this month, the Japanese political situation will be swept into a turbulent vortex. The Japanese policies after the Diet adjourns have long attracted the attention of the people. The government's announcement of its six basic policies, coupled with the opposition parties', especially the Socialist Party's, arbitrary criticism, seems to have startled the world. Political observers believe that the government's six basic policies and their specific measures are nothing new and are merely stale clichés. Whether Prime Minister Yoshida and his cabinet members can maintain their current position depends entirely on the support and unity of the government parties. The Socialist Party has been ambiguous in the past due to complex internal circumstances, but its recent actions prove that the party has made significant progress. The government believes that although the new constitution was promulgated on November 3, it will not take effect until six months later, and a large number of proposals related to the implementation of the constitution will be submitted to the extraordinary and ordinary sessions of the Diet for discussion. Therefore, the government believes that hastily dissolving the Diet would inevitably lead to a political disconnection of one or two months and prevent the constitution from being implemented. For this reason, although the opposition parties have fiercely criticized it, the government's attitude has always been firm and has not shown any signs of wavering.</p>
<h3>Siamese Air Force Conspires to Stage Coup; Plot Exposed, 20 Officers Arrested</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Bangkok, 21st Dispatch] The police department announced today that the Siamese Air Force's conspiracy to stage a coup has been exposed and twenty air force officers have been arrested. It is claimed that the officers planned to launch the coup at midnight on Sunday, detaining Prime Minister Khuang Aphaiwong and other cabinet members, but senior officers did not participate in the conspiracy. Troops have been stationed at key points in the capital for several days. According to well-informed sources, the people who launched the coup planned to invite a well-known figure in Siamese politics to form a new government.</p>
<h3>US Coal Miners' General Strike; Federal Court Accuses Lewis; Truman Ends Vacation and Returns to Washington to Handle Labor Dispute Personally</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] San Francisco, 22nd Broadcast: President Truman ended his vacation today and is scheduled to fly back to Washington tomorrow to personally handle the labor dispute.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, New York, 21st Dispatch] The US coal miners' general strike has begun today, affecting only a small number of non-union coal mines. Government lawyers have drafted a contempt of court lawsuit accusing Miners Union President Lewis of failing to prevent the strike of 400,000 miners. Coal mines in various states have reported that they have completely stopped striking. Bituminous coal mines in various states normally produce 2.2 million tons of coal per day, but today they have obviously all stopped production, and there is no hope for tomorrow either.</p>
<p>#### 400,000 Miners Now Staying at Home</p>
<p>The American flag is hanging in various state mines, waving in the wind, symbolizing that the federal government has taken over, but no accidents have occurred. The strike has even affected the anthracite coal mines in Pennsylvania, where 7,500 workers in eight major coal mines have also gone on strike. This major strike poses a significant threat to the US economy. Bituminous coal supplies 95% of the locomotive power, 55% of the industrial power, and 62% of the power generation nationwide. If the strike lasts for a long time, it will leave about 25 million workers unemployed, as the lack of coal is enough to force factories across the country to close. The industrial magazine "Iron Age" stated that the strike will force the steel industry to reduce production to 80%, compared to 91.5% last week. The lack of steel will cause thousands of manufacturing plants to close. Republic Steel announced today that it will reduce production to 65%, which is equivalent to a monthly reduction of 150,000 tons of steel production.</p>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 22nd Dispatch] Yesterday afternoon, almost all of the bituminous coal miners in the coal-producing areas of five US states went on strike. 102,000 bituminous coal miners in West Virginia, the largest coal-producing state in the United States, 100,000 bituminous coal miners in Pennsylvania, and the coal miners in Ohio, Illinois, and Maryland have all gone on strike. Judging from the reports from mines across the country, almost all of the 400,000 workers have gone on strike. US authorities believe that the coal mine strike will have an impact on US inland transportation and will be a major blow to the world's food situation.</p>
<p>#### US Dockworkers Still Unable to Return to Work</p>
<p>[Associated Press, San Francisco, 21st Dispatch] Although the strike issue of the dockworkers belonging to the Congress of Industrial Organizations has been resolved, they were still unable to return to work at the docks today because the captains, mates, and pilots unions belonging to the American Federation of Labor advocated extending the strike and deployed pickets at the docks to prevent the dockworkers from returning to work. The union will vote on the terms of the contract negotiated with the Pacific American Shipowners Association in the next two days. Before the terms of the contract between the captains, mates, and pilots unions and the shipowners are resolved, the Pacific coast will remain closed. Even if the terms of the contract are passed by the union, shipping is unlikely to return to normal before next Monday.</p>
<h3>Truman Takes Vacation; Underwater Exploration</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Key West, Florida, 21st Dispatch] President Truman is currently on vacation here. Today, he took a captured German submarine and descended to 440 feet below the surface of the Gulf of Mexico. He enjoyed the four-hour submarine trip very much. He once made an underwater excursion, which lasted 44 minutes. The President also watched a destroyer fire at a target 2,000 yards away on the surface and observed the explosion of depth charges and felt the vibrations. The submarine is a snorkel type, equipped with a respirator, which can be extended out of the water like a periscope while the hull remains underwater. There are convection boilers in the submarine, and the device simultaneously intakes water and exhausts steam for the engine, allowing the submarine to remain underwater for a long time in preparation for an attack. One of these submarines is being improved by the US Navy Department.</p>
<h3>Rampant Corruption in Romanian Elections; U.S. and Britain Refuse to Recognize as Legitimate</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] San Francisco, 22nd: Widespread reports indicate that the U.S. government has refused to recognize the Romanian elections as valid. Byrnes will raise this issue at the Four Foreign Ministers Conference.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] London, 22nd: Broadcast reports that a British Foreign Office spokesperson stated that the British government is currently considering its policy towards Romania. The spokesperson declared that the British government would never recognize the recent Romanian elections as legitimate.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 21st] Initial reports received by the British Foreign Office indicate that the recent Romanian general election last Monday did indeed have significant irregularities, such as: (1) Opposition party representatives were not allowed into many polling stations in Bucharest and various provinces; (2) Several opposition candidates were arrested; (3) Many people had more than one ballot; (4) Ballots were pre-marked before distribution; (5) Intimidation and coercion were frequent. It is reported that a large number of people gathered in front of the U.S. Military Mission office in Bucharest to protest their failure to receive ballots.</p>
<h3>Japanese Government Announces Purge List</h3>

<h3>Our Nation's Young Musicians to Perform Piano in the United States</h3>
<p>Fundraising to Support Chinese Music Students Studying in the U.S.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, San Francisco, 22nd] Three Chinese children diligently practiced piano during the Japanese occupation and gave a stunning public performance on Victory Day, December 12th of last year, receiving high praise. They arrived in the U.S. on the General Buckner, expected to arrive here today, and will perform for President Truman during Christmas, before touring and performing in various locations. The three children are George Wei (8 years old), and his two older sisters, Madeline (10 years old) and Sophie (12 years old), accompanied by Captain Littell, station director of the American Forces XMHA radio station in Shanghai. The event is being managed by the Chinese Children's Welfare Association to raise funds to support Chinese students with musical talent to study in the United States.</p>
<h3>800-Year-Old Giant Python; Fears No Tanks; Amazing Story from the Yunnan-Burma Road</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Singapore, 22nd] Local Chinese newspapers are the first to report the astonishing story of a truck convoy encountering a giant python on the Yunnan-Burma Road. It is said that a military truck loaded with supplies was traveling from Burma to Yunnan when the driver suddenly felt the vehicle was blocked by something. Upon investigation, he saw a giant python lying across the road, with its body half-buried in the mud. It was so long that its head and tail were not visible. By this time, the entire truck convoy had arrived, and everyone got out of their vehicles. A 17-ton tank was used to drive over the python, but the python was seemingly unaffected, only slightly moving. Several young American officers, driven by curiosity, proceeded along the python's body to search for its head. After walking several hundred steps into the forest, they finally saw an enormous head resting on a rock, seemingly napping. One officer climbed a tree, intending to shoot it with his modern automatic rifle, but at that moment, the python woke up and raised its head directly to within a few yards of the tree. The officer, terrified, fell into the python's mouth and disappeared. After receiving the news, the U.S. military command sent bombers to drop over a dozen bombs on the python, finally killing it. After skinning it, over a dozen helmets, pistols, and rifles were found inside its stomach. Zoologists estimated that the python was over 800 years old.</p>
<p>(Editor's Note: This story was already circulating in Yunnan before the victory of the war of resistance.)</p>

This application form will be forwarded by the Municipal Government to the Ministry of Interior for approval.

<h3>UNRRA Staff Suspected of Smuggling; Not Detained; Leaves Shanghai for Philippines</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] UNRRA Western staff member O'Keefe, was suspected of smuggling earlier this month and was escorted to the District Procuratorate by the police. The District Court, due to the Basic Agreement signed between our country and UNRRA, which stipulates separate regulations for crimes committed by UNRRA staff, requested an interpretation from the Ministry of Judicial Administration. The Ministry of Judicial Administration instructed that UNRRA staff crimes, except for those arising from official duties, are not exempt from extraterritoriality, as was published in this newspaper yesterday. O'Keefe's whereabouts have increasingly attracted attention. According to UNRRA sources, O'Keefe is now in Manila, and he was never detained by our country's authorities before leaving Shanghai.</p>
<p>O'Keefe submitted his resignation to UNRRA a few days before the news of smuggling broke. UNRRA had been investigating the case for some time, and after obtaining substantial evidence related to the case, they notified the Jianghai Customs and our country's police agencies. UNRRA, because our side did not detain O'Keefe, convened a meeting of O'Keefe's crew members and customs representatives, ordering O'Keefe to attend, and requiring O'Keefe to report to the UNRRA office twice a day, reporting on the progress of the case. At that time, UNRRA believed that our country's law only imposed fines for smuggling, so they did not detain him. Unexpectedly, although O'Keefe initially reported as ordered for a few days, he eventually secretly left his residence and arrived in Manila via Hong Kong. UNRRA stated that the organization attaches great importance to this matter, and whenever staff members engage in illegal activities, the organization immediately notifies the customs and police. The organization currently has over thirty inspectors, whose specific responsibility is to investigate such violations of Chinese laws and regulations, and immediately notify the relevant authorities in this city of all cases.</p>
<h3>Municipal Government Meeting Yesterday Decided to Establish a Literature Committee; Existing Municipal Gazetteer Office's Operations to be Merged into the Committee</h3>

The Literature Committee will have seven to fifteen members, appointed by the provincial, city, and county governments, consisting of experts and heads of relevant agencies and schools.

In addition, the facilities and conditions of the provincial, city, and county governments and their affiliated agencies, the main products and output, general wages and prices, the religious beliefs of the people, the economic situation, the birth and death rates, and the deeds of loyalty and martyrdom of the people are also included in the committee's investigation, and records should be made and classified by month for future reference. The above official letter has arrived at the Municipal Government and was approved at yesterday's Municipal Government meeting. From today, the operations of the existing Municipal Gazetteer Office will be merged into the committee. The director of the Gazetteer Office will submit a list of experts and heads of relevant agencies and schools for approval, so that they can be appointed as members of the Municipal Literature Committee.</p>
<p>In addition, the Municipal Government meeting also decided yesterday: (1) The Shanghai Tram Company and other commercial public utilities will be taxed according to the business tax. (2) The interim measures for investigating grain registration will be revised.</p>

The intention is to subsidize the nutrition of Shanghai's public school teachers and staff.

<h3>Inside Story of the Barber Industry Labor Strike; Labor Side Uses "Sacrifice Play"; Four Defendants Detained</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] During the labor-management dispute in the barber industry in this city on June 1st of this year, labor representative Dai Xingqing was stabbed, and another worker, Zhao Guiliang, disappeared. At that time, barbers throughout the city were enraged, suspecting that the management had kidnapped Zhao Guiliang and assassinated Dai Xingqing, which made the labor strike even more serious. Later, the management discovered the inside story: Dai Xingqing's injury was actually a "sacrifice play" perpetrated by Gong Wenke, and Zhao Guiliang was instigated to leave by Gao Deyu. The four were suspected of using a scheme to incite the labor strike. Fan Jinggao, Sun Yuming, and Chen Yuanfu filed a lawsuit with the District Court. Yesterday, the District Court held a trial. Judge Xie Zhiying, believing that the crimes of the four defendants were serious, immediately ordered their detention and scheduled the verdict for the morning of the 27th.</p>

<h3>North Station Master Catches Thief Empty-Handed; All Stolen Goods Recovered</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Tong Shida, the station master of the North Station, lives at No. 108, Renji Road. At around 10:00 AM yesterday, four thieves, all armed, suddenly broke into his home, forcing the servants and other people to hand over the house hold and valuables. Items stolen included gold lockets, gold chicken hearts, women's watches, and embedded rings. While the robbery was taking place, a Russian, Yapu , who lived on the third floor, had just returned from the horse race. Seeing people standing at the front door, he walked into the second floor and saw two robbers standing next to the staircase, blocking his way and threatening him with guns. The Russian did not yield and argued with the robbers. At that time, one of the robbers who was searching for treasure and heard the commotion hurriedly took the stolen money and fled downstairs. The victim, Tong Shida, also followed and shouted loudly. Together with the Russian, they arrested one of the thieves carrying the stolen goods and found a Mauser pistol. At the same time, the branch in charge had also received a report and sent a large number of police officers to the scene. As a result, the other three robbers were eventually captured. The arrested robber was taken to the bureau for interrogation, and all the original stolen goods were recovered and returned to the original owner.</p>
<h3>Hollywood Filmmakers Intend to Set Up a Factory in Shanghai; Locally Dubbing National Sound and Improving Chinese Subtitles</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] According to Mr. Liang Qitian, chairman of the Shanghai Cinema Business Association, Hollywood filmmakers intend to set up a factory in Shanghai to engage in dubbing Hollywood films with Chinese dialogue and working on Chinese subtitles. American filmmakers attach great importance to the foreign market and have two methods to promote the foreign market. One is to promote 16mm films, because this type of film is light in cost and weight, can be mailed, and is not afraid of fire, making it easy to screen in small cities. The second is to add dialogue in Chinese language to obtain a large audience that does not understand English dialogue.</p>
<p>Many Hollywood films have added Chinese subtitles, but Chinese people working in Hollywood are not familiar with the domestic situation, so they cannot fully meet domestic needs. For example, "Taylor Bowell" is a big star well known to Shanghai people, but if she is translated into the four characters "Tailun Baoer", no one will know. In the past, companies have spent a lot of publicity expenses in the mountains. To prevent this batch of publicity expenses from being wasted, it is necessary to set up a factory in China. As for Chinese dialogue and Chinese explanations, they should also be adapted to the habits of the Chinese people so as not to cause jokes.</p>
<p>"Tarzan Goes to New York" is the first film to add Chinese explanations. This film is mostly action and less plot. MGM will select a film that focuses on the plot and add Chinese explanations to see its effect. The effect of "Tarzan Goes to New York" is worse because many Shanghai audiences understand English. In inland cities, American films with Chinese dialogue will be welcomed. The future trend may be to show two copies of the film in Shanghai at the same time, one with all Chinese dialogue and one with all English dialogue. In inland cities, the former will be shown.</p>
<p>Mr. Liang also told reporters that the number of moviegoers in this city has increased compared to before the war. At the same time, analyzing the identity of the audience, we can see that the income of the lower-class people in this city has increased compared to before the war, so they have the surplus funds to go to the movies. As for domestic films, they have a great future, but each film company needs to have a plan and produce more. Otherwise, it will be very difficult for cinema owners to schedule films if they make only one film every six months or a year.</p>

<h3>Shipping Industry Relief Transport Consortium Signs Charter Contract Last Night</h3>
<p>The United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA), in order to complete its relief program, has chartered various ships to the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CRRRA) on a bareboat basis.

<h3>Industrial Power Supply Improves, Yarn Mill Production Gradually Increases</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper] Thanks to the city's residents' voluntary electricity conservation and the slight increase in the power generation of the Shanghai Electric Power Company, the city's industrial power supply has greatly improved. The power supply for yarn mills is quite sufficient. At present, each yarn mill operates at least five day shifts and seven night shifts per week, and the most operate six day shifts and seven night shifts. The power consumption time is exactly the same as before the war.</p>
<p>In the past, yarn mills were divided into groups for power outages every day. The first group was from 5:00 to 8:00 p.m.; the second group was from 5:00 to 9:00 p.m.; and the third group was from 6:00 to 10:00 p.m. Since the 25th of this month, there has been a slight change. The first group is from 4:00 to 7:00 p.m., the second group is from 5:00 to 8:00 p.m., and the third group is from 6:00 to 9:00 p.m. After this adjustment, two-thirds of the city's yarn mills can increase their working hours by one hour per day, which can slightly help production.</p>
<h3>Mayor Inspects Central District Shops</h3>
<p>Since the implementation of electricity conservation in the city, shops and residents have voluntarily reduced electricity consumption. Mayor Wu specially accompanied Zhao Zengjue, Director of the Public Utilities Bureau, and reporters to inspect various shops in the central district yesterday afternoon from 5:30 p.m. to 6:30 p.m. The inspection results were very satisfactory. It was also heard that the Longhua Cement Plant's generator will be borrowed by the Chinese-owned Electric Company and can generate 1,440 kilowatts. An agreement has been reached. After the Public Utilities Bureau sends personnel to inspect and test the machine, it can generate electricity and increase the supply.</p>
<h3>A Group of Water Rats on a Grand Parade on Land</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper] At 10 a.m. this morning, the police局警察局will have another "豪举豪举" to cause a sensation among the citizens of Shanghai.</p>
<p>The style of theft has always been prevalent in Shanghai, and as a result, the police局警察局launched a grand parade of thieves; some time ago, everyone said that the public order on the water was really too bad, and the "water rats" stealing goods had long been well known, so today there are one hundred and several tens of "water rats", under the strict supervision of detectives, parading again, and being sent to the District Prosecutor's Office in a mighty manner.</p>
<p>It is said that among these one hundred and more prisoners, four headmen are particularly skilled and can steal two bags of white sugar, lurking in the water, and then seize the opportunity to escape. Often, the formalities for customs clearance of goods have not yet been completed, and the market is already selling them, which is the trick played by these "water rats". As for stealing warehouses and receiving stolen goods, there are even more tricks and wonders.</p>
<p>It is not easy for detectives to arrest "water rats" because they are really proficient in swimming. So, if the detectives are not careful, they will often be dragged to the bottom of the water with their guns. This time, more than one hundred were captured, which is really the result of painstaking efforts for more than a dozen days.</p>
<p>Today's parade will pass through Fuzhou Road, Racecourse Road, Luzon Road, Central Lin Sen Road, and Sinan Road, all the way to the District Prosecutor's Office. At 4:00 p.m., the police局警察局will also entertain reporters to report on the activities of the "water rats". At the same time, the Water Police局警察局has now obtained two patrol boats, one of which began patrolling the Huangpu River early yesterday morning; the other is still being repaired.

<h3>Social Services; Reader Consultation</h3>
<p>Medical and Health</p>
<p>(1) Stubborn Stomach and Intestinal Ailments</p>
<p>Xu Jingsheng asks: I suffered from gastrointestinal disease at the age of 21. After an X-ray examination, it was diagnosed as duodenitis and chronic appendicitis. After taking medicine for two years, I gradually recovered. In the 26th year of the Republic (1937), when the War of Resistance broke out, I moved around constantly and lived an unstable life, which caused the old illness to recur. Although I recovered after taking medicine, it still recurred from time to time. In the autumn of the 33rd year of the Republic (1944), it relapsed and has lasted for almost two years, without being completely cured. In the past month, the number of times it has occurred has increased. I feel tired, and my chest feels stuffy, making it difficult to stand up straight. Bending over slightly provides some relief. When it hurts, pressing it with my hand alleviates the pain slightly, but my stomach is constantly gurgling, which is even worse when pressed. I have no appetite and often feel nauseous. I only feel slightly relieved after vomiting all the sour water and accumulated material in my stomach. As a result, my body is becoming thinner day by day. Please advise me on a treatment method so that I can get rid of the pain as soon as possible. I will be eternally grateful. (1) Is it better to eat rice porridge or cooked noodles? (2) Are there any special medicines on the market? What medicine can I take to eradicate the disease completely? (3) Is there any way to remedy my weight loss? (4) Will it cause other diseases?</p>
<p>[Answer from Dr. Tang Renjin, Medical Doctor] (1) Noodles are more suitable. (2) There is no special medicine, but it is still advisable to inject Larostidin. If used in conjunction with large doses of vitamins, it will be more effective. (3) Focus on increasing nutrition and supplement with medication. (4) It may cause systemic weakness.</p>
<p>(2) Deficient and Weak Body</p>
<p>Liu Suying asks: I am a married woman. I have several medical questions. I hope your column can answer them. (1) My period has not come for three or four months. Am I pregnant, or is it due to illness? (2) My mother is 45 years old and has a weak body (she raised six younger siblings). She is mentally listless and has a poor appetite. What is her ailment? (3) My mother is easily annoyed, irritable, and fatigued. She often has chest tightness and lower abdominal pain. What is the reason? (4) Are Vitamins B and C suitable for general deficiency? Do they affect pregnant women? (5) Are the ingredients of the multivitamins sold on the market reliable? Are they effective? (6) Which is better, Squibb cod liver oil capsules or Scott's cod liver oil?</p>
<p>[Answer from Dr. Tang Renjin, Medical Doctor] (1) Please consult an obstetrician to examine the uterus to determine this. (2) She may have parasites. A stool examination should be performed first. (3) This is a menopausal phenomenon. (4) Not necessarily. They are beneficial to pregnant women (especially Vitamin B1). (5) The ingredients are generally reliable. If used properly, they are all effective. (6) Each has its own advantages, but the latter contains more calcium.</p>

<h3>Reasons for Soaring Gold Prices; Central Bank Releases 200 Bars; US Dollars Peak at 4,800 Yuan; Many Unsettled Import Goods</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Gold prices continue to rise, reaching a peak of over 2,630,000 yuan yesterday. When inquiring with relevant parties, they stated that the reasons can be summarized as follows: (1) There is an abundance of floating capital, which is not daring to invest in the production industry due to inflation, and high-interest loans are full of risk. Therefore, buying gold is the only way to preserve value; (2) Currently, some high-interest loans use collateral, but the interest rates are low compared to buying gold. The profits are not that high, and safety and convenience are not as good. Therefore, they abandon lending and buy gold; (3) Among the major cities in the country, Shanghai's gold prices are lower. Therefore, some floating capital is concentrated in this city to buy gold. Some people also use this as a business, buying gold in Shanghai and transporting it to other ports to sell. The risk is small, and it is very convenient; (4) A portion of the wealthy class is buying large amounts of gold. They believe that among various commodities, gold prices have increased less, and will inevitably rise sharply in the future. As for the rise in US dollars, it is not as fierce as gold because speculators are deeply afraid that the government may prohibit US dollars from circulating in our country in the future. Therefore, they do not dare to buy them in large quantities.</p>
<p>In other news, the black market for US dollars remains firm. The reason is that although the government has promulgated measures to strengthen the control of import trade and strictly prohibits the import of foreign goods that have not been approved, there are still many foreign goods in this city that have been imported but not settled. In fact, it is still difficult to completely eliminate smuggled goods. Therefore, merchants still have a strong need for black market US dollars, so the market price remains extremely firm in secret.</p>
<p>Yesterday, buyers frequently stirred, and the central bank fully responded. It opened at 2,588,000 yuan and was forced to retreat to 2,570,000 yuan. But the market was bullish, and there was a turnaround. People rushed to buy again, and it soon rose back to 2,615,000 yuan. High-level pressure was frequent, and some parties settled their positions, resulting in a flat market. It then fell back slightly to 2,585,000 yuan. The central bank allocated 200 bars at a price of 2,587,500 yuan. After 10 AM, it was very quiet for a while. Around 11:30 AM, buyers rose again, and the market price immediately rose to around 2,635,000 yuan. The pressure was forced to increase. At noon, it suddenly fell to around 2,590,000 yuan. In the afternoon, the deferred delivery rose again, hovering around 2,605,000 yuan. As a result, it rose by 34,000 yuan compared to the previous close. Gold ornaments rose to 274,000 yuan. Silver bullion was 3,800 yuan. Silver dollars rose slightly. The underground lending market was still stable, with underground interest rates still at 1.2 to 1.5 jiao.</p>
<p>The foreign exchange situation fluctuated. The retail price of US dollars was still 3,500 yuan to 3,530 yuan. The highest price on the clear market was around 4,800 yuan, but it fell back to around 4,700 yuan at noon. It rose again in the afternoon, hovering between 4,750 yuan and 4,800 yuan, a slight increase compared to the previous close. The supply of Hong Kong dollar bills was low, rising by 10 yuan compared to the previous close. The actual sales of Hong Kong exchange were limited, with a shortage of supply at 920 yuan. Indian exchange was 1,105 yuan to 1,115 yuan. British exchange was 14,700 yuan to 14,800 yuan. Only Hong Kong exchange had some trading. The official exchange rate of US dollars was still flat, and back-to-back trades were still quiet.</p>
<h3>Remaining Yarn Freed for Distribution; Limited to Members of the Yarn Traders Association; Textile Construction Announces Restrictions</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Mayor Wu summoned Wang Qiyu, Chairman of the Sixth District Cotton Spinning Association, Tang Zhiliang, Chairman of the Yarn Traders Association, Zhou Jiasheng, Standing Director, and Shen Boqin yesterday afternoon. Liu Wenteng, Director of the Business Department of the Textile Control Committee, also participated. Mayor Wu proposed to amend the Textile Control Committee's decision to allocate the remaining cotton yarn to the Yarn Traders Association, as requested by the Cotton Spinning Association, and requested that it be freely sold by each yarn factory. After research, it was finally decided that the remaining cotton yarn could be freely distributed by each yarn factory to its existing customers, but the customers should be limited to members of the Yarn Traders Association. The discussion adjourned at approximately 5 PM.</p>
<p>China Textile Construction Public Company sold a total of 1,251 pieces of various yarns yesterday. 185 pieces of 10-count Limatong yarn, 1,530,000 yuan per piece. 249 pieces of 16-count Fengnian grass package, 1,620,000 yuan per piece. 8 pieces of 16-count Jifeng grass package, the same price as 16-count Fengnian. 533 pieces of 20-count Lima large package, 5,330,000 yuan per piece. 276 pieces of 32-count Xiantao tube, 2,320,000 yuan per piece. The listed prices for other 60-count and 80-count double-strand unmarked cone yarns were 5,550,000 yuan and 6,000,000 yuan respectively, but no one requested to purchase them. It is heard that a total of 639 yarn merchants requested to purchase yarn yesterday. The Textile Construction Company specifically revealed two points: (1) Merchants who have withdrawn from the association will have their allocations stopped. (2) Merchants who have ceased operations must not request purchases under false pretenses. If any fraud is discovered, it will be immediately reported for investigation. However, according to news from the Yarn Traders Association, a considerable number of non-members also requested to purchase yarn from the Textile Construction Company yesterday.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market was dull in both the open and underground markets. Although yarn merchants entered the market as usual, they only sat and chatted and did not discuss transactions at all. The fact that yarn merchants, who had been looking forward to the Textile Control Committee's allocation for four months, were able to resume applying for purchases yesterday, even though the amount allocated to each family was extremely limited, was a stimulant for people in the industry. In addition, the Yong'an Yarn Factory released 150 pieces, half of which were sold to long-term customers, and half of which were intended to be sold to the industry in general through the Yarn Merchants Association. However, when this method was decided, the market had already dispersed, so it was temporarily reserved. As for the outside black market, because the Textile Control Committee's allocation was imminent, the asking price was slightly weak, 4 million yuan for 42-count Blue Phoenix and 2.3 million yuan for 20-count Single Horse. The cotton cloth market saw lively trading as merchants from Tianjin and Hankou continued to favor it at lower prices. Asking prices were firm and flat. Dyeing factories in this city were adding more orders for greige fabric, and various types of goods were hovering in a firm and quiet state. The opening price for Longtou fine cloth was shouted at 92,250 yuan, and serge and tribute silk were also popular.</p>
<h3>Rayon Continues to Arrive; Cost of Import is 500,000</h3>
<p>[Our Report] According to related sources: The second batch of 4,800 boxes of Japanese rayon arrived in Shanghai a few days ago and is currently being cleared through customs. There are still more than 10,000 boxes on the way. According to relevant people, the government's purchase price for each box of rayon is 500,000 yuan. (The selling price is 2,800,000 yuan per box.)</p>
<h3>Government Bond Market Hovering</h3>
<p>The trading volume of government bonds suddenly became scarce, and the market was hovering. The price difference between the various bonds narrowed. Tong Bing opened at 1,380 yuan in the morning, with the high price being no more than 1,390 yuan. It fell to 1,280 yuan midway, and finally hovered between 1,320 yuan and 1,350 yuan. The transaction volume was approximately 3 million yuan. As a result, Jia and Yi were flat compared to the previous close, while Bing, Ding, and Wu each fell by 50 yuan.</p>
<h3>Rice Prices Hovering; Coarse Grains Generally Flat and Weak</h3>
<p>Yesterday, over 12,000 shi of rice and grain arrived at the North and South markets. Because the weather turned overcast, the market became more bullish, and trading volume increased. Northern and Southern japonica rice rose uniformly by 300 to 1,000 yuan. It fluctuated and temporarily entered a hovering state. Indica rice also rose smartly, and white yuan was firm. Yin yuan was actively transacted, and the price rose by over 1,000 yuan. Soybeans were still lackluster, showing a dull and weak state. Mung beans were mediocre. The arrival and sales of wheat were both slow, without gain or loss. Flour sales remained sluggish, and factories continued to supply it as usual. Miscellaneous brands of flour were unpopular. As for bean cakes, Taiwan and Fujian had shipments coming in, but Shanghai factories and oil factories in Changzhou, Wuxi, and the mainland were all selling. The market price was still fair, but fresh ones were slightly higher by 100 yuan. Sesame sales turned weak, falling by 1,000 yuan. Peanut kernels had no major transactions in both the local market and other ports, and remained in a weak state. Medium and lower grades fell slightly by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan, while high-quality goods were still stable. Red sorghum had no demand from distilleries, falling by 100 to 200 yuan. The oil market had few buyers and sellers. Various factories allocated a total of 500 dan of oil. The market price remained the same, with raw oil being nominally stable but actually firm.</p>
<h3>Meeting to Improve the Silk Industry in Jiangsu and Zhejiang; Requesting Investigation of Autumn Cocoon Costs and Purchase at Market Price</h3>
<p>Regarding the improvement of the silk industry in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, a meeting was previously convened by Zhang Daohong, representative of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry. Attendees included representatives from the construction departments of the two provinces, responsible persons from the China Silk Corporation, and Chu Furen and Leng Jun from the Third District Silk Reeling Association. The meeting lasted for three days. The resolutions passed are recorded as follows: (1) Please request the Raw Silk Purchase Committee to investigate the actual cost of autumn cocoons and request that national banks and bureaus purchase them at cost to protect silk merchants. The cost per dan is as follows: (A) Cocoon cost: 4,375,000 yuan; (B) Silk reeling: 1,440,000 yuan; (C) Interest: 581,500 yuan; Total: 6,396,500 yuan. That is, each dan of autumn silk must be sold for 6.4 million yuan to avoid losses; (2) It is proposed to organize a national silk industry loss investigation committee during the War of Resistance to compile a statistical report to provide to the Central Wartime Compensation Committee as a basis for negotiating compensation for losses; (3) The original silkworm seed is insufficient by about 4,000 sheets. Please request the China Silk Corporation to find ways to supplement it. The use of local varieties should be reduced through political and economic means. Local silk should have the same obligations as improved cocoons to bear the ancestral seed price subsidy fee and improvement fee.</p>
<h3>Silk Weaving Industry Loans; Conditions Readjusted; Raw Materials and Finished Products All Changed to 50%</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Electrical Silk Weaving Industry Association applied for a loan, which was previously approved by the Four Banks Joint Treasury. The principle was to use 70% of raw materials or 30% of finished products as collateral. Members of the association had few raw materials on hand, and if they were used as collateral, they would not have enough working capital. They once requested the Central Bank to use machinery as collateral, but this was not approved. The association recently convened a general meeting of members to discuss countermeasures and prepared a written request, detailing their difficulties. With the efforts of Zhu Tongjiu, Deputy Director of the Audit Department of the Bank of Communications, and with President Bei Zuyi's consideration of the merchants' difficulties, the original decision was readjusted. Yesterday morning, a compromise solution was decided: raw materials and finished products would all be changed to 50%. First, the finished products would be delivered to the warehouses of various banks. The lending bank would issue a check with the payee's name to purchase raw materials, and then half of the raw materials would be delivered to the lending bank as collateral. The other half would be exchanged for the collateralized portion after the finished products were manufactured. All other principles would remain the same. The association was satisfied with this news, and yesterday afternoon, various associations rushed to complete the loan application procedures. It is expected that this morning, they can be submitted to the Central Bank and the Bank of Communications for processing. For factories with less than 10 machines, the Central Bank has sent a letter to the silver and money industry and the industrial and commercial banking group to start this Monday. The association currently has a total of 375 member units, with no more than half of the members owning more than 10 machines. Based on the calculation of the number of machines in operation, the total amount is approximately 15 billion yuan.</p>
<h3>Yarn Industry Association; Member Survey; Total of 500 Companies</h3>
<p>[Our Report] According to a recent member survey report by the Yarn Traders Association: the association had a total of 636 members in the past. The current survey shows that there are only 613 companies. Of these, 83 have already ceased operations. There are currently 530 members who are officially operating. Among them, there are 34 retailers, 23 of whom have been qualified through investigation, and 11 are still under review. There are 486 wholesalers, 292 of whom have been qualified through investigation, and 194 are still under review.</p>
<h3>Rayon; Directly Distributed to Manufacturers; Notification to Apply Yesterday</h3>
<p>The China Trust Bureau decided to allocate rayon to the knitting, dyeing, and weaving industries separately due to the rising black market price of rayon and the silk merchants' excuse of demand from the knitting, dyeing, and weaving industries. It notified the respective industry associations yesterday to handle the application matters and issued investigation forms to be filled out. Once the procedures are completed, it can be implemented. The China Trust Bureau's original plan to allocate rayon to rayon merchants has now decided to directly allocate it to manufacturing companies. However, if necessary in the future, it will be reconsidered. The bureau's eleventh allocation of rayon to applicants from the electrical silk weaving industry resulted in a total allocation of 347 boxes and 15 packages of grade 120 high and small.</p>
<h3>Unauthorized Transport of Cotton Yarn Detained; Authorities Dispatch Personnel to Conduct Strict Investigations Separately</h3>
<p>In order to prevent unregistered cotton yarn from being transported and sold to other ports without authorization, the authorities dispatched a large number of people to guard the North Railway Station, wharves, and major thoroughfares yesterday to intercept cotton yarn transported to other ports. If manufacturers forcibly attempt to transport unregistered cotton yarn to other ports, it will be detained. As a result, many yarn transports were blocked at the railway station and wharves yesterday. It is heard that this matter will be handled by the municipal government and the Textile Control Committee.</p>
<h3>There are No Restrictions on Transporting Silver Coins Domestically; Large Amounts of Copper Coins Should Be Purchased</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance telegraphed the Central Bank, stating that Article 4 of the Measures to Prevent Smuggling and Carrying Gold and Silver Out of the Country stipulates that the domestic transport of silver coins, which are not for export, is exempt from restrictions on area and quantity and the need to apply for passports. In addition, Article 7 of the Measures for Converting Silver Coins and Silver into Legal Tender stipulates that there should be no price difference between silver coins and silver and legal tender. Violators will have their property confiscated. Those who intend to evade the law and exchange silver coins and silver at high prices, thus violating other laws, will be punished according to the regulations. Therefore, silver coins and silver can be transported freely domestically, but they must not be sold at a price difference. As for copper coins carried in large quantities, they should be confiscated and sent to your bank for purchase in accordance with the regulations. The bank has notified all branches to comply.</p>
<h3>Wood's Strong Competitors: 1. Kerosene…2. Coal Balls</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The sources of firewood in this city are both water and land routes. The water route comes from Wenzhou, and the land route comes from Hangzhou. Among the two, the water route is the main source. The sales market is limited to Shanghai, and there are more than 60 businesses engaged in this industry. The firewood industry is currently quite depressed because wealthy families mostly use kerosene, and modern families mostly use coal balls. Only poor families use firewood.</p>
<h3>Import Industry to Discuss Quota Allocation Methods Today</h3>
<p>The Import Goods Management Committee has decided to adopt a quota system in accordance with regulations for imported materials. The allocation of imported goods by each importer will be determined by the Allocation Department of the committee. The allocation methods are still under study and will be announced soon. The import and export industry associations will discuss this issue again today and invite Chen Changtong, Director of the Secretariat of the Executive Committee, to attend the meeting to explain and clarify the actual situation.</p>

<p>[United Press Chicago, 21st] Wheat futures rose another two cents today, reaching a new price in 26 years. The January contract closed at $2.155, the highest price since 1920.</p>
<h3>Erratum</h3>
<p>In the "Revised Provisional Measures for Import and Export Trade Attachment Table" published in this newspaper on the 18th, the tariff code number "644 (A), (B), and (C)" under the item of quota-allocated goods in Attachment Table (2) should be "644 (A), (C), and (D)." We hereby correct this.</p>
<h3>Merchants Bring Oil to Shanghai; Authorities are Willing to Provide Convenience; The Joint Allocation Office Allocated 900 Dan Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Yesterday, the trend of edible oil remained firm, and the market did not improve, with asking prices above the negotiated prices. The Social Affairs Bureau ordered the Miscellaneous Grain, Oil, and Cake Industry Association to temporarily suspend trading yesterday. However, yesterday, merchants went to great lengths to transport 400 dan of bean oil from North China and entrusted the Shanghai Edible Oil Joint Allocation Office to allocate and sell it to 200 edible oil retail stores in the Central District at the negotiated price. It is heard that Mayor Wu was very pleased that the merchants cooperated with the government to supply edible oil to the people and stabilize oil prices. He instructed Ji Mingzhai, Chief of the Food Section of the Social Affairs Bureau, to tell the merchants that the municipal government will provide special economic or administrative convenience to the merchants who supply edible oil to the people of this city, so that the merchants can continue to transport it.</p>
<p>In addition to accepting 400 dan of oil allocated by merchants, the Shanghai Edible Oil Joint Allocation Office continued to allocate 500 dan of oil from private factories yesterday and delivered it to the allocation office for distribution to 142 retail stores in the Central District. Therefore, the total number of edible oil retail stores in the Central District that have received allocated oil, including those who received it the day before, has reached 484. The quantity of oil allocated by various private factories yesterday was 80 dan of Dadexin rapeseed oil, 60 dan of Dayouyu soybean oil, 100 dan of rapeseed oil, 20 dan of Dasheng rapeseed oil, 100 dan of Dachangxin soybean oil, 65 dan of Changde soybean oil, 15 dan of Weimin soybean oil, and 60 dan of Shunyu soybean oil.</p>
<h3>Current Available Chips Scarce, Chinese Stock Market Quiet</h3>
<p>The Chinese stock market yesterday experienced a severe shortage of available chips. Spot trading prices were more likely to rise than fall. Some short sellers were becoming long buyers, resulting in a more struggling market. Stocks opened high in the morning, but some trades did not occur. After the opening, prices dropped sharply as sellers competed. No. 176 strongly bought Shanghai Yong Knitting, while No. 152 bought Sino-French, creating a tight market. Prices rose again after the drop. At 11:25 AM, No. 126 and No. 10 sold a significant amount of remaining Shanghai Yong Knitting shares, causing all stocks to fall back to their lowest prices. However, from 11:45 AM onwards, Nos. 152, 180, 97, and 151, among others, jointly started buying, and gold notes also rose, causing prices to return to slightly above their morning highs. Near the close, there was turnover, but the closing prices had buyers. As a result, compared to the previous close, Shanghai Yong Knitting and American Asia fell by 3%, while Sino-French, Jingfu, Xinguang, and Qinxing each fell by 0.5% to 1%. Yonggong alone fell by more than 1%. Huafeng's fall was limited, while the cold stock Rongfeng remained stable. The rest fell slightly to a bit more than 1%. Deferred delivery stocks fell slightly to a bit more than 1%. In the afternoon, short sellers continued to exert pressure at high prices, causing prices to fall sharply. However, since available chips for spot trading were very scarce, there were many who covered their short positions at low prices, providing support for turnover. Trading was extremely quiet, even for Huafeng, which had gained popularity with deferred delivery trading the day before, and it became much more deserted. Cement prices fluctuated greatly due to a misunderstanding between No. 176 and a floor manager, resulting in a competitive spike: buying high and selling low, fluctuating by as much as ten dollars. As a result, compared to the previous close, Shanghai Yong Knitting and Huafeng experienced a slight decline, while American Asia, Jingfu, Xinguang, and Qinxing each fell by 3% to 0.5%. Sino-French fell slightly, while Yonggong alone fell by 1%. The cold stocks Rongfeng and Innerwear rose slightly, while An fell by a bit more than 1%. The rest experienced slight declines. Deferred delivery stocks Shanghai Yong Knitting, American Asia, Huafeng, and Sino-French fell slightly, while Jingfu, Xinguang, and Qinxing fell by around 0.5%. Over-the-counter stocks experienced slight declines.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks again felt unsustainable. Except for Ewo Brewery and Paper Industry, which remained flat, the rest were all undersupplied. As a result, compared to the previous close, Yeguang fell by a bit more than 0.5%. Paper Industry and Ewo Brewery remained flat, while the rest experienced slight declines.</p>

<h3>Soviet Union Does Not Send Representatives to UNESCO Conference; American Newspapers Publish Editorials; General Assembly Discusses 1947 Budget</h3>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 21st] The Preparatory Committee of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) today discussed the 1947 budget, totaling $7,565,000. Representatives from several countries delivered speeches, requesting priority for various projects. The largest item in the budget is private research grants, totaling $2,970,130. Professor research grants and subsidies totaled $1,252,870. In addition, the expenses of the Preparatory Committee are estimated at $950,000. The total expenses for this General Assembly are $8,515,000.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Paris, 21st Dispatch] The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization decided this morning to invite Sweden and Iceland to send representatives, and to invite Switzerland to send observers, to the organization's first General Assembly. However, the request of the Spanish Republican government in exile to send observers was rejected due to "legal difficulties."</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 21st] The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Conference continued its meeting. After a speech by Chinese representative Dr. Zhao Yuanren, Yugoslav observer Opu Sen Sky followed with a speech stating:</p>
<p>How to Guarantee Individual Cultures</p>
<p>Yugoslavia has not yet ratified the UNESCO Charter because the Charter does not provide any protection for those who oppose fascism and war promoters. Furthermore, although UNESCO now has a work plan, it does not provide sufficient guarantees for the preservation of the individual cultures of participating countries. If the above two matters can be guaranteed, then Yugoslavia can fully participate in UNESCO's activities without further expressing refusal. Since Yugoslavia issued this statement, political figures here have generally believed that the Soviet Union has also adopted a similar view and therefore refuses to participate in UNESCO.</p>
<p>An Empty Seat Awaits, but No One Arrives</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 21st] The Preparatory Conference of the United Nations Educational and Cultural Organization decided today to invite the Spanish Republican government in exile to send representatives to the meeting, which is tantamount to an indirect blow to Franco's rule in Spain. Polish representative proposed inviting the Spanish Republic as an observer, but the chairman of the conference, French representative Lu Bo, proposed a formal invitation, which was approved by a vote. Earlier, the Secretary-General of the General Assembly, British representative Huxley, reported that many of the decisions of the United Nations Educational and Cultural Organization cannot escape the opposing ideals centered on the Soviet Union and the United States. Therefore, the participation of the Soviet Union is extremely important. The clash of ideas is an inevitable fact in the current stage of history. Although the Executive Committee of the UNESCO Preparatory Committee has kept a seat vacant for the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union has not arrived, nor has it sent observers. We are all saddened by this. If a powerful and culturally advanced country does not join as a member, then this organization cannot become truly global.</p>
<p>No Police, No Power, No Guarding</p>
<p>[United States Information Service, Washington, 21st] American newspapers and magazines have recently focused on the first General Assembly of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization in Paris, and have published editorials and news reports on its activities. The New York Times stated today: "The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization faces a practical problem: how to win the Soviet Union's participation and cooperation. The American delegation is going to Paris to attend the meeting and has made some suggestions. These suggestions are not just empty talk. The suggestions actually start with repairing libraries, museums, laboratories, and schools; rewarding research in meteorology, navigation, international health, and infectious diseases; cooperating to remove elements that incite hatred from textbooks; assisting in the exchange of students, teachers, scholars, artists, scientists, government officials, and other personnel; and studying how to promote and improve the collection of intelligence, information, and culturally significant materials so that they can be exchanged internationally. It is not difficult for us to understand why the Soviets are hesitant. They do not want their people to be exposed to ideas that they consider unorthodox. However, if they participate in the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization as we hope, they will not be forced to accept these ideas. The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization has no police power and no intention of guarding. Its struggle against 'suspicion and distrust' relies on voluntary cooperation. Yesterday was a good start for this work. Lyon Blum has been elected as chairman. This shows that courage and vision have been recognized. The proposed budget figure of $9 million is far from the previous estimate of $1 billion to $2 billion. This shows that the organization has a sense of being realistic."</p>

<h3>Military Medical School's 44th Anniversary</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Among the Chinese medical schools, three have the longest history: (1) Tianjin Medical School, founded in the seventh year of Guangxu. (2) Beiyang Military Medical School, founded in the twenty-eighth year of Guangxu. (3) Xiehe Medical School, founded in the twenty-ninth year of Guangxu. Among them, Xiehe and Military Medical School still enjoy a high reputation. Beiyang Military Medical School is the predecessor of the Army Military Medical School now restored in Shanghai. Before the War of Resistance, the Military Medical School was headed by Chen Hui, Liu Ruiheng, and Shen Kefei. In the past ten years, President Chiang has served as the concurrent principal, and Surgeon General Dr. Zhang Da has served as the director of education. The school is internally divided into: (1) Research Department, (2) University Department (divided into medicine, pharmacy, and dentistry), (3) Specialty Department (divided into medicine and pharmacy), (4) Affiliated Advanced Nursing Training Institute, Pharmacy Class, and Military Medical Preparatory Corps. There are currently more than 1,300 students enrolled. Dean of Academic Affairs Dr. Yu Shaoqing has formulated a seven-year graduation for the medical department of the university. To meet the needs of wartime troops, it has been shortened to six years. High school graduates are recommended by public and private secondary schools across the country, and take examinations in the recruitment areas of each province. After being admitted, they are first concentrated for six months of military training, with the treatment of first-class soldiers. After passing the examination, they are formally enrolled and assigned to the department they voluntarily study, enjoying the legal treatment of corporals. The medical and dental courses are five years, the pharmacy course is four years, and the internship is one year. During the internship, they receive the treatment of warrant officer medical officers. After passing the final graduation examination, they obtain the qualifications of first lieutenant medical officers, and then they are promoted according to their merits. President Chiang has now designated the new urban area of Shanghai, using the large hospital of the enemy army that can accommodate six to seven thousand beds as the school site. The original three military medical branch schools in the Northwest, Southwest, and Guangzhou have been merged into one place to form the center of China's military medical education and the general hub of national defense medical and pharmaceutical culture. It is reported that the school has now officially started classes. The 44th anniversary of the school will be on the 24th of this month, and a celebration meeting will be held.</p>

<h3>Black and White Encounter Powerful Opponent Tonight: Fighting League Leader Hualian Team; Held at the Municipal Gymnasium at Six-thirty</h3>
<p>The Filipino Black and White men's basketball team has played five games in Shanghai, winning two and losing three. The main player Xiao Huatuo was injured in the battle against Zhenglun and was unable to play, so the strength has inevitably been slightly affected.

Tickets are 3,000 yuan upstairs and 5,000 yuan downstairs. The referees are Qu Honglu and Wu Xiaodi.</p>
<p>Black and White's expedition to Shanghai has not been ideal. The two recent games seem to have made considerable progress compared to before. Tonight's sixth expedition, the opponent is the sea champion, Black and White will definitely do its best to achieve its goal. Hualian, who dominates Shanghai, has three musketeers under its command, the veterans Li Zhenzhong, Kong Guangyi, and Chen Xuechong, as well as the famous players Bao Songyuan and Wu Chengzhang. Recently, they have gained Cai Wenhua, the center of Qunsheng, and Zhang Yuyi, the guard. This encounter with Black and White, the labor force is equal, and the strength is comparable. The excitement and stimulation of the game at that time is expected. The starting lineup for both sides is as follows:</p>

<h3>The Heavy Burden of the People of Henan and the Tragic Situation of Constant Attacks in Anyang</h3>
<p>— By Our Special Correspondent Shao Shenzhi</p>
<p>20th [Day of the Month] Dispatch</p>
<p>Touring the Yellow Flood Area – Unable to Hold Back Tears</p>
<p>The main focus of how to save Henan from disaster lies in engineering technology, while neglecting politics. For example, blocking the breach of the Yellow River is a world-known issue, but the dark side of China’s engineering circles is not familiar to the general public. The new embankment at Huayuankou, originally scheduled to close before the flood season, was watched live as it was washed away.</p>
<p>An elegant intellectual accustomed to the life of Jiangnan, a liberal educated by the church, could not help but cry when he visited the Yellow Flood Area. He said to me, "The fact that the people in the disaster area still talk to you with smiling faces is the direct cause of my tears." This person is not fragile, but he saw that the life of the Chinese people today is "so that's how it is," and he saw a trace of a smile flashing on the faces of the disaster victims, as if he had explored the depths of their souls, and he was deeply moved. His tears may be said to be the hope of China.</p>
<p>After the relief sub-station's work team distributed flour to each household, the Baojia heads in some places would take it back and redistribute it to line their own pockets. This is an open secret. "We can't control this," the person in charge of the relief sub-station said helplessly.</p>
<p>The Huayuankou project is nominally a work-relief program, but in reality, it is conscripted labor. The headquarters stipulates that each worker receives one and a half pounds of flour per day. "They think the workers eat silver thread rolls. A worker on a construction site needs to eat two pounds of flour a day, and some even eat two and a half pounds," the field worker of the sub-station ridiculed this regulation. "However, it must be admitted that the United Relief Organization has indeed spent a lot of money here." The latest news is that the famous hydraulic engineer Savage may come to take a look.</p>
<p>The tractor training class of the Fan family in Weishi County is often troubled by the Communist army, and the detention of personnel or vehicles is a common occurrence.</p>
<p>Taking Fugou County as an example, the population before the war was more than 300,000, and now there are only 60,000 left. The past is gone, they have all sunk into the yellow sand, and among those who are left, more than 200 are blind. Because they lack business, what about those with good eyesight? Most of them still talk to you with smiling faces.</p>
<p>Classical Grandeur - An Unbearable Spiritual Burden</p>
<p>Running on the streets of Kaifeng, where the provincial government is located, a county-level official congratulated me that he had finally seen the provincial authorities today and could go back. Because running from a faraway county to the ancient Bianliang, making a trip, submitting a report, and waiting for half a month or twenty days without seeing anyone is a common occurrence. This is truly classical grandeur.</p>
<p>At No. 68 Madou Street, there are two plaques: one is the "Henan Yellow Flood Area Rehabilitation and Construction Association," and the other is the "Henan Yellow Flood Area Rehabilitation and Construction Guidance Committee," but there is no public office to handle affairs. The only person who is often there is a worker!</p>
<p>The classical grandeur has given the people of Henan a spiritual burden!</p>
<p>If the Internal Strife Does Not Stop, the People Will Have No Choice But to Hang Themselves</p>
<p>Henan has frightening apportionments. What I saw in Xinxiang and Anyang in northern Henan was simply a man-eating apportionment. Zhang Ji, the chief of staff of the 40th Army, who is from Henan, said to me earnestly, "The people of northern Henan are really suffering! You reporters should write about it!" If the internal strife does not stop and peace cannot be achieved, the people will have no choice but to hang themselves.</p>
<p>Any store or household can produce a large stack of notices for apportionments since the victory, for money, grain, grass, fodder, and firewood. All kinds of items are listed on it, a magnificent sight that dazzles the eyes. There are several apportionments a month, so there are several notices. Generally, they can be summarized into the following items:</p>
<p>The first is military supplies, including military grain, grass, and fodder. Each county has a supply branch, which is responsible for providing supplies locally, and these are all unpaid apportionments. Anyang apportioned 3,056,000 catties of wheat for the months of July, August, and September this year. It must be delivered within three days. According to the "old practice," merchants pay 30% and civilians pay 70%. The merchants pay 30% through the chamber of commerce, and the 70% is apportioned through the rural Baojia. In the meantime, there is suddenly an apportionment for military grain for a certain unit. As long as the temporary commander's office sends a telegram to the county, it is immediately apportioned. The apportionment of firewood, grain stalks, bran, and fodder has been apportioned to the seventh time by September, with each apportionment being 6,000,000 catties of firewood, 1,000,000 catties of grain stalks, 500,000 catties of bran, and 500,000 catties of fodder. This is also according to the "old practice." The Xinxiang County Chamber of Commerce recognized 20,000,000 yuan in shares in the county bank, and used this to offset the apportionment of firewood and grass. The office expenses of the supply branch are, of course, apportioned, and it is not surprising that tens of millions are apportioned in advance in order to save a sum of circulating funds. Even the food expenses of the personnel of the Military Mediation Department must be apportioned by Anyang. Because the transfer orders are not clear, and a small amount is missed, it is not surprising to replenish the various funds at any time. The military also looks at the construction of fortifications, and the requisition of people, money, and materials is also apportioned locally, and the apportionment items are even more difficult to estimate.</p>
<p>Apportionment Has Become a Trend - The Various Levels of Agencies Are Busy</p>
<p>The second is the various expenses of administrative agencies at all levels. When a Bao cannot pay the apportionment, the Bao head is detained by the county government or the town office, and the money spent is apportioned. The Baojia heads and staff are particularly busy attending meetings, listening to instructions, and supervising construction everywhere. The large expenses for transportation, meals, and lodging are also apportioned. There are more than a hundred county-level agencies in Anyang that have been displaced, and the townships and Baojia are ordered to provide furniture and run errands for them. The money spent is also apportioned. Improving the treatment of county-level civil servants is also an apportionment of several million yuan a month. The expenses of various county-level agencies are also an apportionment of tens of millions of yuan a month. The Baojia in the townships and towns entertain the people sent by various departments to urge payment, materials, and labor with meals and cigarettes. A Bao has to spend hundreds of thousands of yuan a month. In order to cope with the busy and tense apportionment official business, the Bao office needs seven or eight people, and the town office is like a county government, working overnight, with huge expenses. These people have only one word in their minds all day long: apportionment. As for the expenses of the Bao national school, it is naturally also apportioned, but the monthly amount is small, less than a few meals and cigarettes for those who urge payment and materials.</p>
<p>The third is the newspapers that must be read and the operas that must be watched. The newspaper fees and opera tickets are the regular expenses of the Xinxiang Chamber of Commerce. There are also consolatory funds for the soldiers, and the uniform expenses of the Qinyang Security Regiment are apportioned by the Xinxiang area, because that is an armed force that can fight. Building a beautiful auditorium in Xinxiang is an apportionment of tens of millions. The "donation" for a certain weekly publication or mutual aid society is also apportioned. Things like this have become a trend and cannot be stopped.</p>
<p>A household in Anyang has 40 mu of land, which, given the current situation, is a poor wretch, but should still be a small landlord. In September, the total apportionment was 29,073 yuan in cash; 104 catties of wheat; 44.6 catties of rice; 173 catties of firewood; 58 catties of bran; and 29 catties of grass. He told reporters that he wanted to escape, but there was nowhere to escape, and he would have to hang himself if it continued.</p>
<p>A small herbal medicine shop apportioned 969.5 catties of firewood, 493 catties of wheat; 161 catties of grain stalks; 80 catties of bran and 80 catties of fodder in the first half of September. This herbal medicine shop wanted to close down, but was afraid of losing his old signboard, so he would not be able to open for business in the future. This means: no closing.</p>
<p>The people say that this is the case everywhere in Henan. I have only seen Anyang and Xinxiang, and I don't hope that other places are like this. In any case, this is an iron fact that the people cannot bear. How can a county administrative agency become an apportionment agency in the midst of war?</p>

<h3>Guangdong Provincial and Municipal Governments Fight Over Business Tax Agencies</h3>
<p>— By Our Special Correspondent Liang Feng</p>
<p>Guangzhou Air Dispatch, 15th [Day of the Month]</p>
<p>In Jiangnan, this should be the season when osmanthus blossoms are fragrant, but in Panyu, it is still as hot as late summer, so hot that it makes people feel bored and irritable. There has not been a drop of rain for more than a month, and the dust on the road flies up when cars pass by, making everything smoky.</p>
<p>Just like this situation, a rather comical thing has happened here recently, which is really laughable and ridiculous. I don’t know if the provincial government is short of funds and wants to rely on tax revenue to supplement it? Or if the municipal government sees that the provincial government can collect 3.6 billion yuan in business tax in the second half of the year, and the municipal government only gets half of it, and is a little envious? As a result, a funny scene of the provincial and municipal governments fighting over the business tax collection agency occurred.</p>
<p>The performance went like this: at 9:00 a.m. on the 6th of this month, the Guangzhou Municipal Temporary Council held its fifth resident committee meeting. After the director of the Municipal Finance Bureau, Chen Bingduo, gave a policy report, Councilor Zhang Xizhe asked whether the Municipal Business Tax Collection Office was subordinate to the provincial government or the municipal government. Director Chen replied solemnly that because the business tax is one of the local taxes, it should be merged into the tax bureau. The establishment of the Municipal Business Tax Office is actually an illegal organization. The municipal government has never recognized the existence of this agency, and the central government has not recognized it as legal either, but the provincial government established it regardless of the law!</p>
<p>As soon as this statement came out, people from all walks of life were surprised, because the Business Tax Office was officially established on September 1st, and it has been engaged in tax collection business for more than two months. Could it be an illegal organization? Then this joke is too big! Why didn't the municipal government make a public announcement or use administrative and judicial power to abolish or sue it? But why is the establishment of this agency by the provincial government criticized by the municipal government as an illegal organization? This makes people unable to doubt the subtlety of the relationship!</p>
<p>The reporter visited various places for this matter. According to the person in charge of the Provincial Department of Finance: "The business tax is a provincial tax and a tax for cities under the jurisdiction of the Executive Yuan. This is clearly stipulated in Article 8 of the Fiscal Revenue and Expenditure System Law promulgated by the National Government on July 2, 1946. After searching all the laws promulgated, there is no regulation that prohibits the establishment of a special agency, so it cannot be said to be an illegal organization. According to Article 3 of the 'Measures for the Collection and Payment of National and Local Shared Taxes,' it also states that the business tax is collected by the central collection agency on behalf of or entrusted to the county (city bureau) for collection after being approved by the Executive Yuan. The so-called entrustment must be determined based on the necessity of the entrustment and whether the entrusted agency can bear the responsibility of handling it. The provincial government is the competent administrative agency of the local government and has the power to weigh the pros and cons. The business tax in this city has been approved by the provincial government and is collected by the Guangzhou Municipal Business Tax Collection Office, and it has been announced to the public. Before receiving a telegram from the Ministry of Finance, it was also in line with the general situation that in order to avoid the increasing burden of local taxation, the collection should be entrusted to county and city agencies. However, the provincial government believes that the amount of business tax in this city accounts for the majority of the entire province. In order to meet special needs and achieve results, it has again telegraphed the Ministry of Finance to approve that the Municipal Business Tax Office should still be responsible for the collection, and is now awaiting approval from the Ministry." In this way, since the business tax is stipulated as a provincial tax, the provincial government can establish an agency to handle it, and it can also be said that there is no regulation in the law that it is an illegal organization.</p>
<p>However, what did the municipal government tell us? According to the person in charge of the municipal government, "The municipal government wants to handle this matter with a peaceful attitude and does not want to say much, but only to implement administrative orders. However, Article 2 of the Business Tax Law stipulates that all business tax affairs originally handled by the central and provincial (including provincial-level cities) direct tax collection agencies should be transferred to the finance departments of each province and the tax collection agencies of each county and city (the rest omitted)... Therefore, it is also stipulated in this regulation that it should be handled by the tax bureaus of each county and city. In fact, the municipal government has repeatedly received telegrams from the Ministry of Finance, Jingdi Sanyang No. 4427, which roughly stated: 'In order to unify and enrich the county and city collection agencies, it is not necessary to set up another agency.' It also received telegrams from the Ministry of Finance, Caijing Zhi'er Shenxian No. 358, which roughly stated: 'The telegram orders the direct tax bureau to transfer the order to the Guangzhou branch to transfer it to your government for management according to regulations.' It also received two telegrams from the Guangdong Direct Tax Bureau, both stating that the transfer should be transferred to the Municipal Tax Collection Office for management. From the above telegrams, it is sufficient to prove that the Business Tax Office is not allowed to be established separately, and it is stipulated that it should be transferred to the Municipal Tax Collection Office for management." It seems that the reasons are very sufficient, otherwise how dare they offend their top superiors.</p>
<p>In order to seek details, the reporter went to the Guangzhou Direct Tax Bureau to inquire about the transfer process of the bureau. It was stated that: Regarding the transfer of business tax, the bureau had previously received an order from the Ministry to prepare to transfer the business tax to the Municipal Tax Collection Office in accordance with the "Measures for the Transfer of Land Tax, Deed Tax, and Business Tax to Local Management." Later, it received a letter from the provincial government stating that the Business Tax Collection Office had been established and requested to take over. At the same time, it also received a letter from the municipal government requesting the transfer of business tax. The bureau immediately submitted a request for instructions, and on September 26th, it received a reply from the Ministry of Finance No. 3395, stating that it should be transferred to the Municipal Tax Collection Office for management. The bureau was about to transfer it, but on September 28th, it received a telegram from the Provincial Government Shenjian Cai No. 6 Zi No. 22557 stating that the Business Tax Office had already been established, and detailed reasons were also submitted to the Ministry of Finance for approval. Before receiving a reply, please postpone the transfer temporarily. The bureau again telegraphed the Ministry of Finance for instructions, and still received approval to transfer it to the Municipal Tax Collection Office according to the original plan. Later, it also received a letter from the Municipal Tax Collection Office stating that it had received an order from the provincial government to order the Business Tax Collection Office to be under the jurisdiction of the municipal government, please transfer it and send Secretary Chen Qinglong to the bureau to discuss the handover. At this point, the bureau officially transferred the business tax on October 5th.</p>
<p>Looking at the opinions expressed by the above parties, the provincial government holds the "laws," while the municipal government is righteously following the "orders of the Ministry." Each has its own reasons, which seems to have turned into a contradiction between "laws" and "orders of the Ministry."</p>
<p>Fortunately, this material dispute did not expand. This complex problem was finally reported yesterday (10th) that the Ministry of Finance telegraphed: "In order to unify the collection agencies of counties and cities and enable them to respond and go to work, the Ministry has separately planned and handled it as a whole. The business land deed tax in Guangzhou should be handled by the city's collection agency without setting up another agency. The proposed establishment of a special business office should be stopped." In this, we finally got a clear answer - the municipal government has won, but in the eyes of society and in the hearts of the citizens, it has left an impression of "it's too much of a joke!"</p>

<h3>Paris Prophet Old Tie Predicts Future Wars: The Third World War Will Break Out in Sixteen Years, Hoping to Obtain International Understanding and Provide Essential Capital to Eliminate [War]</h3>
<p>Air Dispatch, 14th [Day of the Month] Our Special Paris Correspondent Wang Ren</p>
<p>Louis Marin, a member of the French lower house for a long time and now seventy-five years old, recently wrote a book entitled "The Security of France (La Securite de la France)," which states that the northeast of France is the only undefendable border (Frontiereouverte) that is not bordered by natural barriers. In the future, the border of France should be expanded eastward to reach the banks of the Rhine. This dispute, which has lasted for 1,100 years since 843 AD, has now been brought up again by Louis Marin and will definitely become one of the focal points of the debate at the General Assembly. Looking back on the past, the prosperity and decline of France and Germany have generally been cyclical. The Parisian youth prophet Old Tie (Ranyaud de la Ferriere) accurately predicts future events. During the European war, such as the Allied forces' attack on Europe in 1944 and President Roosevelt's ceasefire in 1945, he predicted them all. Recently, in September, the United States abolished price controls and had some internal difficulties, and in October, the frequent occurrence of aviation accidents. Old Tie had also spoken out in advance, and unfortunately, everything was as expected. Now, what makes his predictions attract the attention of the whole world is that 1955 will be one of the most prosperous years in Europe, and the next Third World War must begin in 1962. Knowing that disaster is inevitable, we always hope that human efforts can reverse the situation. The fundamental problem of preventing future disasters lies in being able to broaden the rule of benevolence, pacify the hearts of those who are against us, prevent the motives of discrimination among ethnic groups, and achieve international understanding. Perhaps the events of sixteen years later can be transformed from large to small and from small to nothing.</p>

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>Qi Baishi's Position in the History of Painting and Calligraphy</h3>
<p>— Yu Jianhua</p>
<p>Qi Baishi has undoubtedly occupied a place in the history of modern Chinese painting, but the height of this position cannot be determined now.</p>
<p>Su Dongpo wrote about Wu Daozi's paintings: "Those who know create things, those who are able describe them." Those who know are the sages with foresight, that is, the masters who can create their own school. They are also those who are not intimidated by power, not tempted by profit, do not care about gains and losses, do not care about praise and slander, go their own way, clarify their goals, hold on to their principles, do not cater to the times, do not follow the crowd, and fight for the truth throughout their lives, not stopping until they reach their goals, that is, revolutionary reformers. At the beginning of their creation, ridicule and attacks came one after another, society condemned them, the government oppressed them, and they were even thrown into prison, sentenced to death, and nailed to the cross. But when they succeed, they will influence the trend, create schools, and even be worshiped by the masses and admired by future generations. They become immortal figures of the ages.</p>
<p>Those who are able are those who are less capable than the creators, and can only learn from the creators, imitate the creators, inherit the creators, or get one of their aspects, or have a specific microcosm. Following Xiao Gui and Cao Sui, step by step, they are already very satisfied if they learn a few points. Being high-minded, they never dare to have the extravagant hope of surpassing their predecessors. They can only use "narrating but not creating" as a way to relieve themselves, and the spirit of "creating independently" is minimal.</p>
<p>In the late Qing Dynasty, the early Republic of China, and up to the present, in the school of freehand flower-and-bird painting, Wu Changshuo is naturally the "creator," and Wang Yiting and Qi Baishi cannot avoid being in the ranks of the "narrators," although Qi also has his unique style.</p>
<p>Su Dongpo said in Xun Qing's theory: "If his father kills someone for revenge, his son will surely rob." This also means that the creator, although a talented writer, inevitably has some biases. A kind of literary and artistic work that is too regular and orthodox is inevitably boring, so literary and artistic writers like to be unique and create their own banners, wanting to win by surprise. Moreover, there are few all-round talents in the world, and more biased talents. A person's bias is his strength. Developing his bias as much as possible is also developing his personality as much as possible, so he can rise as a dark horse and become his own master. This kind of biased place of literary and artistic artists is most obvious, forming a unique face, and one can know at a glance that it is the work of a certain person or school. However, at the beginning, the creator does not necessarily have the intention of creating a certain school, but only follows the proximity of his nature and the extent of his strength, and after years of research, he unknowingly evolves into a certain kind of face. For example, Shi Tao and Bada's early paintings were also very meticulous, Wu Changshuo's early paintings were also very elegant, and Qing Daoren's characters were not so tortuous "one wave three times" in his early years.</p>
<p>A person's bias, when viewed from the front, is his strength, but when viewed from the opposite side, it is precisely his weakness, so it is easy to have drawbacks. Bold brushwork is originally a strength, but it is easy to become domineering. Elegant brushwork is originally a strength, but it is easy to become weak. Therefore, the strong are straightforward first, the delicate are too trivial, the thick are turbid, the free and easy are frivolous, the gorgeous are vulgar, and the light are sparse. There is a benefit and a drawback. In the creator, there are originally more benefits than drawbacks, and the advantages can still cover up the shortcomings, which are not very obvious. However, when his descendants learn from him, they develop his bias as much as possible, extend it as much as possible, and intensify it, turning the bias into a habit and the strength into a fault. They follow each other and use it as a drawback, which is beyond the expectation of the creator.</p>
<p>The existence of Wu Changshuo in freehand flower-and-bird painting is beyond what the Yangzhou Eight Eccentrics could imagine. After Wu, Wang Yiting is not very different from Wu. As for Qi Baishi's pure use of carmine to write flowers and pure use of thick ink to paint leaves, such as maple trees, red camellias, begonias, lotus flowers, and chrysanthemums, I am afraid that Wu did not expect it at the beginning.</p>
<p>A painter who can become a master naturally has his true skills and unique appearance. A unique appearance is easy to learn, but true skills are not easy to learn. Changshuo's thick branches and large leaves are easy to learn, but Changshuo's spirit of epigraphy is not easy to learn. Yiting's flying brush and ink dance are easy to learn, but Yiting's mellow and ancient spirit is not easy to learn. Baishi's red flowers and ink leaves are easy to learn, but Baishi's arrogant and unyielding spirit is not easy to learn. From this point of view, the three families can be said to have their own merits.</p>
<p>A painter does not have to be proficient in every field. As long as he has one or two masterpieces that others cannot reach, it is enough for him to become a master. Wen Yuke only painted bamboo, Zhao Zigu only painted narcissus, Ni Yunlin only wrote withered trees and thatched pavilions, Zheng Suonan only painted orchids, and one skill is exquisite. As long as he can reach the peak, he can also be immortal for thousands of years. "Qiu's skill is in chess, Liao's skill is in pills, Yang Youji's skill is in archery, and Zhang Xu's skill is in cursive script." They all specialize in one skill throughout their lives. As long as Qi Baishi paints two crabs and shrimps, he can be said to be unparalleled in the world, not only now, but also occupy a considerable position in the history of painting. It seems that he does not need to use red, red, green, and green colors to compete with others for beauty.</p>
<p>From a general point of view, the Wu, Wang, and Qi families can be said to belong to the same school. If we distinguish them carefully, the three families are different. Wu only writes flowers (he also painted landscapes in his early years), Wang also writes flowers, birds, and figures, especially good at Buddha statues. Qi writes figures, flowers, birds, and landscapes, and crabs and insects are his best. Therefore, it can be seen that to learn from a person, although you learn it vividly, it is only a replica, and at most you can only become a second-rate "narrator." You must have your own expertise outside of the teacher's school, which was not available to your predecessors. Although most of them are "narrators," some of them are also "creators," and his position in art will be greatly improved. If Wang and Qi only painted two strokes of thick branches and large leaves of flowers and had no unique points of their own, it would be difficult to keep pace with Wu.</p>
<p>A school of painting has creators and also has enders. For example, the Loudong School of Painting, Huang Zijiu is the founder, and Wang Yuanqi is the ender, because he has reached the highest peak and cannot move forward. The Zhejiang School was founded by Dai Wenjin and Wu Xiaoxian, and it would not work if it were not ended by Zhang Pingshan, Jiang Sansong, and Lan Tianshu. Of course, after the ender, there are inevitably many people who are eager for fame and power, or admire the past, which has become a declining trend. The end of the crossbow is like "below Qin Hui," which is not worth mentioning. In modern times, Wu Changshuo is naturally the pioneer of freehand flower-and-bird painting, but the responsibility of ending this school seems to be Qi Baishi.</p>
<p>That is why I said that in the history of modern Chinese painting, Qi should occupy a position anyway. As for the height of this position, I can only wait for those who write the history of Chinese painting in the future to determine it for him.

<h3>A Brief Biography of Mr. Qi Baishi</h3>
<p>— Rong Zhuo</p>
<p>Old Man Baishi is eighty-six years old this year. He was born in Baishi Village, Xiangtan, Hunan, so he styled himself Baishi Shanren (Mountain Man of Baishi). His given name is Huang, his courtesy name is Binsheng. He had many other pseudonyms throughout his life, such as Xingziwu Laomin (Old Man of Xingziwu), Jieshan Weng (Old Man Borrowing Mountains), Jipingtang Zhuren (Master of Jipingtang), Sanbaishi Yin Fuweng (Wealthy Man of Three Hundred Stone Seals), Mujushi (Wood Dweller), and Lao Mu Yi (Old Wood One), all of which were commonly used. Before middle age, he once used the pseudonym Jihuan Nu (Slave of Fleeting Illusion), but he no longer uses it now.</p>
<p>He was born into a farming and impoverished family. His childhood was quite bleak. At the age of twelve, he began to learn to make crude wooden daily furniture. A year later, he switched to learning to carve patterns on wooden printing blocks. His artistic foundation was sown here.</p>
<p>When he was engaged in learning to carve patterns on wooden printing blocks, he carved flower boards for others during the day, and at night he bought oil and lit a lamp to study painting. He was so eager to learn that he naturally made some progress. Mr. Hu Qinyuan, a fellow villager from Hunan, saw his paintings and heard of his efforts, so he invited him to his home, encouraged him, and introduced him to Mr. Xiao Xiangjie, a painter of some renown in the village, to study painting. At the same time, he also introduced him to Mr. Chen Shaofan, a poet of considerable fame in the village, to study poetry. He studied painting and poetry with redoubled efforts.</p>
<p>After a few years, almost everyone in Xiangtan knew that he could write poetry and paint. First, he was introduced to Mr. Guo Baosheng by his fellow villager Yang Songcui. Mr. Guo was a famous military man at the time, with a refined love of books and painting, so they became friends. Soon after, he met Mr. Li Yumin, a former supervisory committee member. Later, he made even more friends. Those outside the government included Mr. Wang Zhongyan, Mr. Chen Huogen, Mr. Luo Xingwu, Mr. Luo Zhenwu, Mr. Hu Lishan, and Mr. Tan Ziquan. These six gentlemen and Mr. Baishi formed a poetry society in Longshan, known at the time as the Seven Gentlemen of Longshan. At the same time, he also became friends and teachers with Mr. Wang Xiangqi, Mr. Fan Fanshan, Mr. Xia Wuyi, and Mr. Yang Xizi, all of whom were famous in the literary world.</p>
<p>As his friends increased day by day, many people invited him to travel far away. He traveled west to Qin (Shaanxi), south to Guangdong and Guangxi, and north to Youyan (Beijing and its surrounding areas), enjoying famous scenic spots. In Shaanxi, he carved many seals for Mr. Fanshan. Lord Fan encouraged him to enter officialdom and gave him the line, "Rather be a solitary dragon, hiding gold and jade, than to prove my innocence in the Dingming Hall." He politely declined. During his first time in Beijing, someone wanted him to be introduced to Empress Dowager Cixi by Liao Dagugu Yunxian. However, he suddenly felt a desire to return home and immediately went back south. When Yang Xizi and others were organizing the Preparatory Society for Peace, they repeatedly telegraphed to invite him to Beiping, but he always stayed in his hometown at the Jieshan Hall, studying philology, seal carving, and painting diligently, never resting. This kind of life lasted for a full four years.</p>
<p>It was not until the sixth or seventh year of the Republic of China (1917 or 1918), when there were many bandits in Xiangtan and warfare in Hunan, that he left his sweet hometown and took refuge in Beiping, starting his life of selling paintings. During those twenty years, although he occasionally went back to Hunan and Sichuan, he lived in Beiping most of the time. After the July 7th Incident (1937), he did not have time to pack up his affairs in the north and was trapped under the iron heel of the brutal Japanese. He was not tempted by profit, not afraid of threats, and did not weary of poverty. He always lived behind closed doors in Kuache Hutong, Xidan, Beiping. During the recent nine years or so of suffering, his heart was extremely pained.</p>
<p>It has been more than a year since the victory, and he is still healthy and able to take a plane from Beiping to visit Nanjing and Shanghai, the capital after the calamity and the prosperous Shanghai. This time, he was able to meet his sons and grandsons as a guest and reunite with many artist friends in Nanjing and Shanghai. This is the most pleasant page in the old Mr. Baishi's life history.</p>
<h3>Interesting Anecdotes from the Literary World</h3>
<p>— Zhan Weng</p>
<p>Xu Yi</p>
<p>Xu Yi passed away in Anhui three months ago. Another poet within our seas has weakened, causing great sorrow. Yi was ashamed of self-promotion, spending his entire life in a poor and remote area. Few knew of him, but his poetry was deeply skilled, even the wise Chen San'yuan could add nothing more. Yi always advocated the theory of no ghosts, promoting the abolition of superstition. In the countryside of She County, a security association was usually held, performing plays to reward the gods, wasting people's labor and money, and the accumulated habits were difficult to change. Although Yi strongly advocated reform, the villagers did not listen. One year, Yi deliberately threw a god into the toilet, saying to the villagers: "If a god has spiritual power, he should come and punish me! Otherwise, it is just a dull and unresponsive wooden puppet, why should we worship it?" The next day, Yi was unharmed, and the villagers gathered together and said: "Mr. Yi’an is from the Hanlin Academy, he must be a star in the sky, the gods dare not offend him. If we, the common people, lose our respect, we will surely suffer misfortune!" In the end, they rewarded the gods as usual. Yi could not stop them, which shows that the superstition of the foolish people is not easy to enlighten.</p>

<h3>An Inch of Land, An Inch of Blood 101</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>After the waiter carefully selected the drink and snacks that Tsurumi wanted and bowed and retreated, Tsurumi lit a cigarette, preparing to concentrate his thoughts and figure out how to deal with the group of people outside the door. His seat was a very comfortable dark corner, from which he could see the entire dance floor and also pay attention to the comings and goings at the entrance. He first carefully examined the dancers on the dance floor to see if there were any relevant figures, and if there were any of his own men. Then he scanned the men and women who had not yet started dancing, one by one, and felt that he was all alone in this place. No one was paying attention to him, and there were no familiar faces. The only thing that caught his attention was a dozen or so foreign men and women. The men were wearing neat formal attire, and from their gestures and actions, it was obvious that they were members of the German Fifth Column. The women, however, could not be identified at a glance.</p>
<p>By this time, "Spring of the Maiden" had been played back and forth three times, and the singers had been replaced twice. Most of the couples on the dance floor were enjoying themselves and did not want to leave the floor, so the band had to switch to a Western tango. Just as the music was changing, Tsurumi finished scanning the people in the room and suddenly caught sight of the large French-style glass door at the entrance opening, and the host bowing solemnly and ushering in a young woman. Although this woman was wearing a standard Western suit and was about five feet two or three inches tall, it was clear that she was of Japanese descent.</p>
<p>In the brief moment that she entered the room and showed her figure, Tsurumi had already given her a score of ninety-five points for her appearance and demeanor. This was because her physique was well-proportioned, her various body parts were in proportion, and her eyes, eyebrows, mouth, and nose were all above average when viewed in relation to her entire face. What was especially important was that the agility of her mind was integrated into a charming and graceful demeanor, exuding from the color of her skin and the posture of her various body parts, forming a kind of natural radiance that could captivate people's hearts.</p>
<p>A young man with a will of steel like Tsurumi was not easily moved. Moreover, in terms of beauty, there was only one Yaoqun in his mind. Yaoqun's beauty, in addition to meeting all the standard external conditions, was beautiful to the bone, beautiful in her soul. And in addition to beauty, there was also a kind of unsullied demeanor that ordinary beauties could not reach. This was not the so-called "beauty is in the eye of the beholder." Even if many third parties were to compare Yaoqun with this Japanese woman, if this Japanese woman was given a score of ninety-five points, Yaoqun would at least be one or two points higher.</p>
<p>Why was there this one or two point difference? Because Yaoqun was purely innocent, while this Japanese woman had a bit of affectation. From Tsurumi's sharp eyes, this woman was bound to have some secrets. She was either a double agent, a secret agent, or a member of the Black Dragon Society or the "Tenno Shuei" group. However, she was definitely not a left-leaning member of the "National Progress Society." In short, she must be a secret figure.</p>
<p>This statement was not entirely arbitrary, because all kinds of arts and crafts have a distinction between insiders and outsiders. If you are an unrelated outsider, an insider will always feel that your every move is out of place. Even if you are an amateur opera performer, even if you have practiced hard, if you are not from a professional opera troupe, you will inevitably be a "sheep," let alone if you are not an amateur performer at all? Conversely, if you are an insider, even if your skills are not high, every move you make is in accordance with the rules and every move is in proportion. Therefore, an insider can tell at a glance. Those who are engaged in secret work, no matter how good you are at disguising, cannot hide it from the eyes of those with experience, because they have been trained in this way and they perform in this way. Even if they try their best to disguise themselves, it is like Sun Wukong's seventy-two transformations. No matter how he changes, in the eyes of the Buddha, he is still a monkey.</p>
<h3>Farewell to Old Man Baishi</h3>
<p>— Sun Fuxi</p>
<p>After Old Man Baishi received our welcome, he is about to return to Beiping. I have many thoughts and will express them in a few lines to show my farewell.</p>
<p>First, Chinese artists are not valued by society. This time, Old Man Baishi was invited south by the government and received a warm welcome from the cultural community. If there are no unexpected misunderstandings, it will definitely increase society's respect for art and artists. I also hope that the old man will lead the Chinese art world to move towards a great and bright future from now on.</p>
<p>Second, China is now in a state of extreme decline. Although we have the aid of the Allied countries, the establishment of a country and a person depends entirely on self-reliance. I do not understand politics, nor do I understand diplomacy, but I only know that relying on the support of this country or that country is not a way to self-reliance. Art takes the spirit of creation, independence, and freedom as its main purpose. I hope that the old man will use the spirit of art to lead the trend and save the dying Chinese customs.</p>
<p>Third, China's exports and imports have reached a ratio of one to twenty. The Chinese people are very tolerant, and they swallow as much foreign goods as possible. What is being imported now is just cigarettes, canned food, and glass leather bags. One day, when construction begins, the machinery and raw materials used in heavy industry will pour in. What ability do we have to balance foreign exchange? The only thing we can compete with foreigners in is art. I am not saying that we should move old antiques such as Zhou Ding Tang Yu and sell them to foreigners. I am saying that we should use Chinese artistic talents to improve industrial and commercial products, and further improve existing handicrafts and sell them abroad. Such products are available everywhere, such as bamboo lacquer, porcelain silk, etc. There is no need to set up factories, just guide the production of local folk crafts and purchase them by the piece. The shapes and colors must be beautiful and meet psychological needs, and as much as possible decorate them with towers, temples, and other patterns, clothing, and the special meaning of history that can attract people's love. If the old man can make a call to action, it will not be a way to save the country through art.</p>
<p>Fourth, I am usually saddened by the fact that I have not achieved anything in learning and conduct, and that I am nearly fifty years old. Old Man Baishi is eighty-six years old, and my personal achievements are not even a fraction of those of Mr. Qi. And my forty-nine years are only half of the old man's age. There are colleagues in the arts who are only one-third or one-quarter of the old man's age. We can work hard and diligently study, and we will surely succeed in the future. If we can do this, then we are all disciples of the old man!</p>
<p>I wish Old Man Baishi a safe journey and happiness, longevity, and health!</p>

<h3>Goldfish</h3>
<p>— Shao Fu</p>
<p>Four months ago, I bought two goldfish and kept them in a fruit plate (I don't know where to buy a large fish tank). Other than having the servant change the water once every morning, there is no other care. But this couple has grown fat and strong in this fruit plate, living leisurely for four months.</p>
<p>The plate is placed on the writing desk in the study. In the silence, I often hear their fine, fragmented chattering sounds. Although it is subtle, it is very real. I often put down my books because of this and ponder over issues such as life.</p>
<p>They keep floating and sinking, chasing each other, chattering, and they look very happy and free. They have never worried about the world of this fruit plate.</p>
<p>If life is like a rolling snowball, if it is like a usurious loan with compound interest, time will create greatness, greatness that is unbelievable. If it is like a burning candle, the result will be nothing.</p>
<p>Perhaps most of us are like these two goldfish. Our world is an invisible fruit plate, with edges and a kind of mystery. And everyone lives on in a muddleheaded and self-satisfied way, waiting for the final natural extinction.</p>
<p>Like goldfish, we are not self-aware, so there is no sadness.</p>
<h3>Difficult to Count Banknotes - A Major Problem in Currency Transactions</h3>
<p>— Chen Tianduo</p>
<p>Sometimes when we go to the bank to get a large amount of banknotes, on the one hand, to avoid procedural troubles, and on the other hand, because we believe in the bank's credit, we often do not check them and just take them and run. But when you use them for other expenses, you may find that there is a considerable amount missing. This situation directly damages the interests of the customers themselves and indirectly affects the bank's reputation. I dare to offer some suggestions:</p>
<p>A preliminary examination of the reasons is actually simple: because of the depreciation of the legal tender and the increase in the face value of the banknotes, there is a situation where a large number of banknotes cannot be counted. Originally, the financial industry has always been accustomed to trusting each other. Seeing that the teller has stamped the banknotes, they will no longer recount them and transfer them for external use, usually only counting the large amounts, not the small amounts. In fact, the number of tellers is limited. If each person counts 5 million yuan per day, then ten people can only count 50 million yuan, while the amount of cash that the bank handles every day is often around tens of billions of yuan. The remedies are as follows:</p>
<p>Promote and improve the bill of exchange credit system. As in European and American countries, all normal citizens have dealings with banks and use this system. This will not only reduce the difficulty of counting cash, but also consolidate finance and cultivate a good bill of exchange credit system. This is the first.</p>
<p>Banks should increase the number of staff and improve their abilities, knowledge, and character. In this way, it is possible to seek speed in procedures and also strengthen the bank's reputation. At the same time, attention must also be paid to improving the lives of the bank employees. This is the second.</p>
<p>Finally, I hope that this serious problem of missing cash can be improved and eliminated through the improvement of the bill of exchange system and the principle of moral integrity. At the same time, I also hope that customers will take this responsibility to protect the interests of each individual.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if the currency system can be adjusted with proper and confidential methods, then the above problem will be fundamentally solved!</p>
<p>Scientific Knowledge</p>
<h3>Stereoscopic Movies</h3>
<p>— Yu Zhang</p>
<p>The Soviet Union can be said to be the first country in the world to show stereoscopic movies on a three-dimensional screen.</p>
<p>A foreign reporter who had seen several experimental screenings of stereoscopic movies in Moscow wrote a dispatch saying: "A tank is driving straight towards you - in a minute, it will crush you - ah! It's driving over your head! You hurriedly lower your head and tilt it to one side - but nothing happens. You're just watching a movie - watching a stereoscopic movie."</p>
<p>Scientists from various countries have long been studying how to make stereoscopic movies. The first group used the principle of stereoscopes to shoot, but they could only shoot static things, like slides, which could not be called movies. And it was also inconvenient to watch, as the audience's eyes had to wear a pair of lenses.</p>
<p>The second phase of researchers used a "protrusion method." When showing the movie, there were also two screens, one showing a red film and the other showing a green film. The audience also wore a pair of red-green glasses - the red lens looked at the green film, and the green lens looked at the red film - the images of the two colors overlapped at one focal point, and it looked like a three-dimensional image. This stereoscopic movie, the simple red and green colors themselves were a defect, and the colored lenses blocked a large amount of light, making the movie dim and unclear.</p>
<p>The third phase, which is also the most successful method, is what the Soviet Union is currently studying. The audience does not need to wear any special glasses, and it looks very clear. All the images are complete.</p>
<p>Several years ago, Semyon Ivanov - a Soviet engineer, the son of a shoemaker - was dissatisfied with flat movies and began to study stereoscopic movies. He experimented with many screens, creating different planes, possibly using dense fine metal wires to pass through them and tie them together. In this way, the screen had depth. He found that as long as it was matched with appropriate projection equipment (projector), this screen could produce a stereoscopic effect without glasses. But this screen required very long metal wires, which was too expensive. Although after many improvements, his final screen with a projection area of ​​25 square yards still required 112 miles of metal wire.</p>
<p>During the war, Ivanov's main job was serving in the military, engaged in aerial surveying. Thanks to his stereoscopic tools, he became one of the most successful Soviet aerial photography experts.</p>
<p>Even so, he never gave up his research on stereoscopic movies. In the third year of the war, he had a great achievement, which was to replace the metal wires on the screen with a large number of conical lenses. This projection plane has now been completed and installed in ordinary theaters, and audiences in any corner can receive a clear stereoscopic effect.</p>
<p>The "Vanotev Screen" weighs over a ton. The projection method has also been completely successful. Last year, Ivanov shot the first feature-length stereoscopic film - Robinson Crusoe - in Tbilisi, the capital of the Georgian Republic and the Transcaucasian Federation.</p>
<p>Just as sound films eliminated silent films, stereoscopic films will also replace flat films. The Soviet Union is now planning to build 20 cinemas dedicated to stereoscopic movies. The first one was recently completed in Moscow. As for converting ordinary cinemas into cinemas that show stereoscopic movies, it is also a relatively simple matter. The "Ivanov Screen" can be suitably installed in front of the ordinary screen, and the projection room and auditorium do not need to be改造.</p>
<h3>Why Not Try to Create Polysyllabic Characters</h3>
<p>— Yu Funan</p>
<p>The newspaper on the 14th carried an advertisement for a "　" "髡" one million yuan micro-tone prize. In fact, it is very difficult to call these two characters with a precise and vivid sound. We know that most countries in the world except our Republic of China use phonetic writing, some characters have one sound, and some have two or three sounds. Therefore, most foreign words represent a meaning, and they are not like some of our words that cannot stand alone. For example, the two words "枇杷" (loquat), if you take out one word alone, you don't know what it means. These two words can only be considered letters, and they only have meaning when they are spelled together.</p>
<p>Therefore, many people think that our Chinese characters are outdated and not enough for modern application and are inconvenient to use. I remember that in March of this year, the Political Participation Council also put forward the idea of reforming Chinese characters. The promotion of phonetic symbols is indeed a good improvement, but it has not yet been popularized in society. A Russian person's name is often translated into a long string of clumsy characters, why not translate it into phonetic symbols for more straightforwardness.</p>
<p>At the same time, we must promote a kind of polysyllabic character to remedy this and eliminate those characters that cannot stand alone. A long time ago, someone proposed writing words together (a word should be written together if it includes two or three characters), which is very appropriate to adopt before the creation of polysyllabic characters is successful. Then, simplify and evolve from writing together into polysyllabic characters. For example, the three characters of library, in modern times, are simplified to "　". It is now commonly used by the public. This "　" character, of course, is still read as the three sounds of the library. This "　" character is an example of the successful creation of a polysyllabic character.</p>
<p>In my personal humble opinion, such as the two characters 枇杷, can be written as "　", similarly, 琵琶 can be written as "琶", 梧桐 can be written as "　", 蚂蚁 can be written as "　" (it is best to simplify here to avoid too many strokes), most of these alliterative and rhyming words can be created into a polysyllabic character, and the "究" and "　" in the advertisement do not necessarily need to call a single sound? Ask the advanced, I wonder what they think? It must be explained here that I do not want to write all the words as polysyllabic characters, but only hope to eliminate those characters that cannot stand alone)</p>
<p>I think: Why not give it a try!</p>
<h3>Why No Follow-Up?</h3>
<p>— Zhuo Qiu</p>
<p>Former French Municipal Council Employees' Voice</p>
<p>In April and May of this year, the "application for retirement pay" issue for retired personnel of the former Public Works Bureau received a satisfactory answer. Following that, the French Consulate General also did not want to be left behind and indicated that former employees of the Municipal Council and the Police Department could apply for registration. Their "willingness to follow good examples" was entirely based on the "friendly Sino-French relations." In fact, the Municipal Council's finances in the past always had a surplus. Even today, the buildings and other movable and immovable properties under its remaining items still possess a massive value.</p>
<p>However, in the past, the employees of the French Municipal Council and the Police Department mostly "governed themselves," and the divisions between departments were too deep. They had never organized a group similar to an association or club. This traditional weakness of disorganization affected the outcome of this application for retirement pay.</p>
<p>Therefore, the registration procedure has ended for several months, and the meeting between Mr. Wang, the representative of the retired personnel, and the French Consul in Shanghai began more than a month ago, but to this day, there is still no follow-up.</p>
<p>Among our retired personnel, many are still unemployed at home. Most of them, during the period when the puppet organization took over the French Concession, were determined to preserve what remained and ended their employment fate at the same time as the French. They are still bitterly waiting for the follow-up on the retirement pay.</p>
<p>Recently, it was heard that "the debts of the former French Concession will be cleared by the end of the lunar year." We believe that this check from the French Consulate General can be cashed soon and will not end up unresolved.</p>
<h3>Weekend Chats: Creation</h3>
<p>Using Poison to Fight Poison</p>
<p>Newspapers report that Wu Shengcai, a notorious thief in Taipei, had a gang of twelve "good fellows" who specialized in robbery and committed all sorts of evil deeds. He was known as one of the "Twelve Stars" in Taiwan Province. Although the authorities tried many times to arrest him, this "Dog Star" was always elusive and out of reach. Coincidentally, the Taipei Theater was showing the American film "The Invisible Thief." Wu, for some unknown reason, suddenly had the idea to take this opportunity to watch and study it, hoping to gain some insights. So, he stealthily went, and that's when he was caught in the police's net. Reading this news, one can't help but applaud. In the past, we often criticized Hollywood manufacturers for using a set of monster movies to swindle people's money, encouraging frivolity and theft, and blaming them in the manner of the Spring and Autumn Annals, expressing boundless indignation. Now, thinking about it, I truly regret that criticism. After all, the "Doctrine of the Mean" of our country has its truth. We overlooked the deep meaning of the filmmakers, "concealing capture in the strange," and instead greatly negated it, which is truly detrimental to our brains.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Let's Talk About Banning Prostitution</p>
<p>Following the lottery to eliminate rickshaws, the authorities now have a five-year plan to eliminate 100,000 prostitutes in the city through a lottery. These past two nights, many ladies in the red-light districts who are "about to have new paths" seem particularly active in the cold wind. I think this is probably because: on the one hand, winter is approaching, and the work of cracking down on street prostitutes must be temporarily put into "hibernation"; on the other hand, perhaps they know that the industry is already at the end of its rope, so to welcome a new life, they are specially putting on a farewell performance to commemorate it. Regardless of whether their activity is meant to imply a protest against or support for the "plan," I believe that the "anti-prostitution theory" has its significance in the current era. Because the existence of prostitutes in Shanghai poses the greatest threat to the good wives sitting at home. In order to maintain the warmth of their families, besides implementing all kinds of precautions against their "husbands," the most important thing is to dress themselves up to compete with the prostitutes for "love." Therefore, luxury goods that originally only catered to the general prostitute class are now gradually being snatched up by the wives. As the wives dress up, the prostitutes seek even more fulfillment, neither yielding to the other, and everyone is advancing at full speed. The import figures for face powder, lipstick, and glass handbags at customs have therefore ballooned. Tracing the root cause to prostitution, who can say that it is not appropriate to ban prostitution with a plan at this time?</p>
<p>Humans and Animals Grieve Together</p>
<p>It is said that the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) has recently shipped another batch of supplies to China, including all sorts of things like soy sauce, chili peppers, and vinegar. The most precious items are 792 mules, which can be called a grand sight. These mules "received short-term training" at the Tianjin UNRRA Transportation Bureau and are "fat and strong." "Not only are they economical to feed, but they can also endure hardship better than domestic mules." Therefore, in Shanxi, they have "already been snapped up by farmers." Some people have expressed regret about this, complaining about the inability of our Central Plains' special product, the mule, to "endure hardship." This kind of patriotism and concern for animals is, I think, "a common sentiment." But judging from the facts, although domestic mules are of excellent quality, in recent years, due to the widespread bankruptcy of farming families, people's livelihoods are already difficult, and raising livestock is even more makeshift, skimping on labor and materials, and feeding them rough fodder is to be expected. "The mule and the owner are both thin." After wandering in ditches, compared to the pampered, well-nourished American mules, they naturally feel ashamed. In fact, comparing animals to people, isn't it the same? These days in Shanghai, various agencies are launching large-scale campaigns in the streets to encourage electricity conservation, but the hair dryers in barber shops are still running. The bureau chief personally inspects straw-roofed toilets, but the price of Er'er's [a type of bun] is still rising. Life is pressing, and people do not obey the regulations like this, so how can we blame our mules!</p>
<p>The Writer is Wrong</p>
<p>I remember that after the tea party held last month in Shanghai to welcome Henry Luce's visit to China, a man named Li Yongkang was arrested for printing and selling "A Western Golden Lotus." Although these two things were a coincidence, they still gave our cultural circles a not-so-small joke. Not long after, it was heard that famous works such as "Red Pants" and "You Love Me, I Love You" had been approved for publication after review. The authorities later once denied this matter, but the denial was superfluous. Originally, with people constantly declining, erotic texts were bound to emerge. In a society where "seduction" and "rape" incidents are endless, "cultural commercialization" is truly in accordance with Heaven and in line with the people, a "product of the times," just as relief goods can turn into commercial goods. They are all birds of a feather, and we shouldn't be so biased or make a fuss about it. However, people like Li Yongkang are also very stupid. Why didn't they take advantage of Luce's visit to China to interview him after the tea party? If so, then his magnum opus "A Western Golden Lotus" could have captured the "Time" magazine's artistic conception and essence, discussing romance while leaving a little bra, [censored], etc., not going too deep, just enough. Wouldn't it be a Chinese streamlined publication? Unfortunately, he missed this move, leading to public resentment, while "Red Pants" and other works that follow suit are sometimes approved and sometimes denied, making it seem like a guessing game.</p>
<h3>Bathhouse</h3>
<p>— Cai Lin</p>
<p>Shanghai Cross-Section</p>
<p>"Bathhouse" means bathroom. Whether it's taking a shower or bathing, people take off their clothes and get into the water.</p>
<p>In the bathhouse, the towels are not segregated. Just after Guest A used it to wipe his [censored], Guest B uses it to wipe his risk in a little while.</p>
<p>The water in the pool is as black as ink and as thick as soup. But the bathers soaking in this muddy soup still don't think it's too dirty.</p>
<p>Many bathers suffering from athlete's foot and scabies like to wash with boiling water in the "hot pool." They think this is enough to kill the itch. It is said that skin diseases are not contagious in the bathhouse, but I don't know on what basis.</p>
<p>If health experts were to run into the bathhouse to investigate, they would think that every bather is an adventurer, and they are probably all untainted by the filth.</p>
<p>The bathhouse is indeed unsanitary on the surface, but the service is very attentive. Steaming hot towels are constantly delivered, and the attendant is always there to wipe your back.</p>
<p>When bathing in the pool, you don't have to do it yourself. The back-scrubber will wash all the dirt from your body using a combination of soft and hard techniques until it is completely clean. Although the back-scrubber has an unpleasant term called "fishing for floating corpses."</p>
<p>Lying on the wax bed, the "foot massager" sits opposite you. While he is massaging your feet, he is also paying attention to your facial expressions, and the lightness and heaviness of his hands can understand your intentions, so-called scratching where it itches.</p>
<p>Several old bathers meet every day and talk freely about everything. Therefore, many people still like to go to the bathhouse to bathe, even though they have sanitary bathrooms at home. Therefore, the business of the bathhouse is still thriving, and the home bathroom is far behind. Health experts shake their heads and sigh!</p>

<h3>Automatically Raising Pay</h3>
<p>— Zui</p>
<p>After the tram fare increase, the first to benefit are the ticket sellers. They used to pocket only 20 to 50 yuan per swipe of oil, but now they pocket 100 yuan per swipe. This is called: The company raises the fare, and the ticket sellers automatically raise their pay.</p>
<h3>Five Circles for One Hundred Yuan</h3>
<p>— Xiu Yi Sheng</p>
<p>At the side of the road are piles of oranges, clay figures, candies, and cigarettes, arranged in rows, as if in formation. In front of the formation, a foothold is drawn with white powder, and in front of the foothold is written: "Five circles for one hundred yuan!"</p>
<p>The circles are all thrown, and no oranges, clay figures, candies, or cigarettes are won. The children (or perhaps adults) then walk away. The practitioner then waits for the second person, the third person.</p>
<p>The "three feet of land rent, three bolts of cloth on credit" stalls have become this "five circles for one hundred yuan" game. There are more ways to make a living, and this is moving towards a productive social education!</p>
<h3>Gold Turns to Manure</h3>
<p>— Zan Ying</p>
<p>Shi Dakai said, "Gold is like manure," but now it is "gold turns to manure." The gold of Fuxing Island has turned into two vats of manure. Although there are many tricks in Shanghai, turning gold into manure is still a first.</p>
