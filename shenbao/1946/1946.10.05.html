<h3>和談局勢仍陷沉悶　中共迄未正式答覆　美使館否認蘇參預調解</h3>
<p>〔本報南京四日電〕關於外傳蘇大使近曾致函司徒大使，對中國時局有所表示一事，四日午美使館發言人康納士鄭重聲稱，絕無其事，並謂司徒大使從未接到蘇大使函件，馬特使亦未與彼有任何信件來往，外傳蘇使將參與調解說，純係謠傳。</p>
<p>〔本報南京四日電〕時局形勢今日仍在沉悶狀態中，政協政府代表致中共周恩來等復函，中共已專人送滬，該函內雖已說明政府對周恩來等所提備忘錄之答覆，已送由馬司二氏轉，但今日上午董必武王炳南往訪馬司兩使時仍詢政府對中共備忘錄有無答覆，並問前日政府所發聲明是否即爲該項答覆？董王與馬司晤談時間甚長，除詢問外，仍以張家口停戰爲談話主題，據聞兩氏未予正式答覆，並聞馬司兩氏對調處仍願盡最後努力，期和平早得實現。四日上午十時半，國府皮參軍宗敢訪司徒大使後，再訪馬特使晤談，司徒大使除接見行總某氏外，晚並宴請教會人士，餘無活動。目前各方所期待者，厥爲共產黨最後態度之表明，司徒大使私人顧問傳涇波，下午五時曾訪宋院長，據傳表示，時局可望於二三日內有轉機。</p>
<p>〔本報南京四日電〕新華社四日稿載，延安三日電，標題爲「中共有資格人士談稱，三人會議應恢復，一月停戰令的效力，和平無保證，中共不考慮參加政府及國大」內容係以問答語氣非正式的答覆政府二日所宣佈時局的聲明，茲略誌如次：（一）謂政府現仍無準備停戰迹象，且認爲進攻張家口即爲表明破裂決心，政府聲明中所提整軍方案，已被撕毀，現在可看作是片面的藉口來束縛中共；（二）三人會議第一項任務即爲無條件恢復，一月十日停戰令的效力，如做不到，中共決爲停戰令與政協決議奮鬥到底，（三）在一月十日停戰令基礎上之和平獲得保證後，中共才能考慮參加政府與國大的態度。</p>
<p>〔本市訊〕中共發言人陳家康，對政府十月二日聲明所提兩項「最大限度之讓步」，認爲並非讓步，而是又一次破壞政協的無理要求。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京四日民電〕蔣主席今日午後五時廿分，約晤青年黨領袖會琦及該黨中常委劉東岩於其官邸，曾氏曾詳述此次遊歷華北東北各地之觀感，關於如何致力民主團結與和平統一亦曾有所陳述，六時十五分始辭出。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京四日電〕青年黨領袖曾琦及該黨中常委劉東　三日下午訪司徒大使於官邸，傅涇波顧問亦在座，曾氏首對大使爲中國和平統一之努力表示敬意，大使謙稱：「勞而無功」，曾氏則謂，大使與馬歇爾元帥之工作，最後必收大效，緣馬氏來華，業已促成二事：（一）爲政協決議，（二）爲整軍方案已雖因軍事衝突而發生波折，然此二事確爲中外與論之所贊同，遲早必能見諸事實，年內定有端倪，此爲最後五分鐘，望大使與馬歇爾元帥仍續作最後之努力，中國青年黨將以國內第三者立塲，協力促其成功，大使爲之欣然，談至五時許始辭出。</p>
<h3>羅隆基等招待記者　申述民盟立塲　對時局純取中立態度</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中國民主同盟昨日下午二時在中正東路紅棉酒家舉行記者招待會，到各報記者六十餘人，民盟方面沈鈞儒羅隆基張君勱黃炎培章伯鈞等均出席。</p>
<p>羅隆基首先發言，略稱今日招待目的在表示民盟對於最近時局發展之態度，分三點而言：</p>
<p>第一，關於和戰問題，亦即統一或分裂之問題，民盟於日前上蔣主席關於國大電報中已有明白表示，我們認爲十一月十二日之國民大會不僅爲制定憲法實施憲政之關鍵，亦爲中國統一或分裂之關鍵。我們主張提前結束黨治，實施憲政，故對於召開國大決不反對，決不毫無理由拒絕參加。但以現在情形看來，十一月十二日以前之一段時期，實爲最重要之關鍵，凡有助於和平統一者民盟當然願意參加，願意擁護蔣先生之領導；如與和平統一無益者，如因此造成長期分裂局面長期內戰者，則民盟非獨不願參加，且最於在社會上挺身而出，加以反對。我們並非反對國大，並非反對結束黨治，而是反對中國經過八年抗戰之後仍有分裂之局面。最近國共兩方均有文件發表，政府提出國府委員名額及駐軍區域兩條件，中共方面如何答復尚未可知。今日民盟並非替中共答復，但因其中名額問題牽連民盟，且關係整個和平統一，故特別提出向社會解釋。中共要求國府委員名額與民盟共爲十四名，有人因此識民盟爲中共之尾巴，與中共有協定。事實上，當時政協會議時，政府之要求爲過半數，中共則提出三三制，其後政府過半數之名額經政協通過，中共堅持須有三分之一否決權，以保障和平建國綱領。民盟不願因名額問題而影響統一團結，且覺國共兩黨經二十年鬥爭，相互間自不免有猜疑之處，爲求得兩黨之合作，使兩黨相互放心而參加聯合政府，故雖明知可能引起外界誤會，但考慮再三後，決定幫助中共取得三分之一名額。坦白言之，當時周恩來在政協尚未閉幕時，曾取得政府之諒解，民盟亦曾與中共表示在運用否決權一點上決予協助合作。殊不料時至今日，此問題仍爲和戰之爭點。民盟意見業由梁漱溟氏發表，我們認爲政府如從無黨無派中拖一名額與中共，此方式極爲不妥，因中共要求者係否決權，民盟不忍因一二委員名額而影響全國之和平。關於駐軍問題，政協會議所訂和平建國綱領已有解決辦法。其中軍事項第一條規定整軍須黨與軍分開，政與軍分開，如能依照實行，而達到軍隊國家化，軍隊不過問政治，則尚有何駐軍問題可言？故民盟強調實施和平建國綱領，並與整軍方案配合以謀解決。</p>
<p>第二，對於美國之態度，民盟旣不反美亦不反蘇，旣不拉美反蘇亦不拉蘇反美。我們願與美蘇爲友，更希美蘇合作。但獨立自主之國家，決不能容忍第二國家在其境內駐軍，故我們主張美軍撤退，且反對任何國家駐軍中國。對於美國以往予我之幫助，我們固然感謝，但不能因此而降低國家地位。且我人主張「美軍」退出中國，非「美國」退出中國之謂，對於經濟上或其他方面之援助，我們並不反對。但有一條件，即不能牽連內戰，否則，如內戰繼續擴大延長，美國應負其責。</p>
<p>第三，民盟對於李聞案及整個民主自由之態度。李聞案在政府方面似已結束，但民盟不能滿意。我們將繼續催促政府注意李案兇手，不能含糊了之。我們必須提醒政府，實現四項諾言及和平建國綱領中人民權利之尊重。</p>
<p>張君勱繼羅隆基起立發言，強調時至今日，大家必須平心靜氣，一致要求和平。</p>
<p>黃炎培最後補充不能再打之意見。</p>
<p>黃氏辭畢，各報記者紛紛提出問題，由羅隆基及章伯鈞分別答覆，內容歸納如下：</p>
<p>（一）民盟認爲和戰關鍵並不在於國府委員名額，而在於蘇北承德隴海綫張家口等地區之戰事。民盟雖帮助中共取得三分之一名額，但並非即永遠帮助中共，而係以是非爲依歸。如萬一國共分裂，民盟將取獨立之態度。因民盟無槍無兵，談不上帮助一方。但民盟還是反對分裂，反對內戰，有一日發言機會，即盡一日力量呼籲和平。</p>
<p>（二）民盟主張美軍撤退，但民盟並不反對美國之慈善救濟及經濟建設方面之投資，如剩餘物資及借款等，應俟中國和平統一以後再予貸助。</p>
<p>（三）民盟反對五五憲草，認爲應以政協通過之憲草，由憲草審議會審議後，再經各黨派之承認。</p>
<p>（四）民盟對於國共並無偏袒，所以對國民黨指責較多者，因係執政黨之故。</p>
<p>（五）民盟認爲目前政府控制下之區域，仍無黨派自由可言，否則民盟會員必可超過國民黨或共產黨之黨員人數。</p>
<p>（六）關於梁漱溟與彼得洛夫談話內容，羅隆基稱尚未獲悉詳細情形，故未能發表。</p>
<h3>中長路瀋陽蘇籍員工　突奉命撤退返國　三日起已開始辦理移交</h3>
<p>〔本報瀋陽三日電〕東北局勢將有國際上之變化，據由種種迹象尋之，似均有此可能，最顯著者，爲蘇撤退中長路　分局蘇籍員工，計有蘇瀋陽分局長波得喀民內等一百九十三人，另有白俄一百七十人。此項命令係於一日由蘇大使館所派秘書携來，中長路理事長張嘉璈，副局長王竹亭，曾加婉留，波等謂係奉令不能再留，故三日起波等已開始辦理移交，雙十節前後可首途赴大連乘船返國。聞留瀋之少數蘇僑民亦將撤退，按當長春共軍將撤退時，蘇僑曾預先奉命撤離，又遼寗行政會議閉幕典禮中，主席徐　曾屢以第二個「九一八」即將來臨警惕所有與會人員。</p>
<h3>菲通過排華法案　業經羅哈斯簽署僑胞大受威脅　我政府將作嚴重表示</h3>
<p>〔本報南京四日電〕菲律賓獨立後，羅哈斯總統以排外政策而膺選，菲人復誤排外爲愛國，排華之風再起「馬尼拉菜塲市營法案」，「勞工菲化法案」，「零售商菲化法案」及或國會中通過，其中勞工菲化法案，規定外籍（美國除外）工人工資總和，在任何工塲中，不得超過總工資之百分之四十；零售商菲化法案，規定任何零售商店之資本總額中，外股（美國除外）不得超過百分之三十。此兩法案對我在菲僑胞，尤屬不利，而後者已於本月一日由羅哈斯簽署公佈實施，僑胞大受威脅，我政府對比極爲重視，除已電令陳質平公使及段茂　總領事積極交涉外，並將再向菲方作嚴重表示。</p>
<h3>匯率調整說不確　當局取締美鈔黑市買賣鉅領高價買戶將予究辦</h3>
<p>〔本市訊〕上海市市政府與中央銀行以近日市塲美鈔價格上漲甚烈，情形逾越常軌，顯有不法商人，從事大量收購，意圖牟利，影響所及，牽動物價，亟應設法制止，日經中央銀行核准買賣外幣之銀錢業，原爲便利商旅，零星兌換，而獲得其正當之利潤，亦應各自整飭，協助推行政府金融政策。市政府經與中央銀行洽商，爲取締美鈔黑市投機，並安定市面起見，除已由錢兌商業同業公會通告暫停買賣美鈔三日外，並訂定買賣美鈔臨時辦法三項，以資遵守，自即日起實行：</p>
<p>（一）經中央銀行指定准許經營外幣行號，對於美鈔買賣，其價格不得超過中央銀行美金電滙定價百分之五，並不是巧立名目，另收費用。</p>
<p>（二）美鈔買賣對於舊券，不得歧視貶價或拒收。</p>
<p>（三）倘有鉅額買戶高價收買，准由該行莊向市府密告，以憑究辦。</p>
<p>記者頃據有關方面探悉，中行日前已奉令實施收購各銀行之外幣在款，對於外幣存款賬，外幣保證金賑，及由前平準基金委員會核准之保證金，開始收購，對於流動之美鈔，將以嚴嶮辦法處理，並爲防止美鈔私運出口，當局已與有關各國商妥防止取締辦法，預料不久市上黑市美鈔價格可望消減。</p>
<h3>錢兌業公會決議美鈔買賣停三天</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕美鈔市况，兩週前曾因匯市謠諑影響，一度直綫上漲。後雖經官方兩度切實否認，惟黑市美鈔堅勢已奠，始終徘徊於四千元關口。乃昨日本市某報忽傳：中央對外匯掛牌，將隨時作適當調整之訊市塲各項謠諑，又告死灰復燃，一時扒購美鈔之風大熾。美鈔價格扶搖直上，猛叩四千六百元之新高價，而買風仍未稍煞。十時許，錢兌業同業公會理事長汪雲程，即召開緊急理事會議，討論應急方案。當決議通知各同業，自即日（四日起，暫停買賣美鈔三日。除分函查照外，同時並登報公告週知。</p>
<p>記者旋趨訪中央銀行貝總裁，貝氏適與會，由盧秘書定中代爲接見，承告：貝氏確於日前赴京，有所公幹，業於昨晨返滬。至此行任務，並不詳悉。渠稱：貝氏對匯市種種謠諑，在市塲波動之秋，不擬發表任何談話。據談：匯率將作經常調整之訊，可能係出於經濟學者之建議，但未必即爲中央所擬訂之辦法。現作此項傳訊者，已自認其消息來源之不確。至本市錢兌業公會決議，全體同業暫停買賣美鈔三日之事，純出於該公會自動之決定。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕錢兌業公會理事長汪雲程，曾於昨日下午五時卅分，晋謁中央銀行貝總裁，報告該業暫停美鈔買賣經過。</p>
<h3>外船載貨進口影響整個市塲</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據傳邇來因本市美鈔市况日高，美鈔私運入口之風遂轉熾。而外洋偶有船舶載貨運到，黑市美鈔因扒購結款關係，即起波動，影響常及於整個金融市塲。當局爲安定金融顧全民生計，勢將斷然取締美鈔交易。並聞下週一錢兌業暫停買賣美鈔之期滿後，當局對美鈔交易，究將採取如何態度，當有相當端倪。</p>

<h3>關內外通滙後怪現象　祇有匯出無匯人　辦法不完善造成了投機之風</h3>
<p>〔本報瀋陽三日電〕關內外通匯後，立刻發生了幾種怪現象，一者爲數千萬元流通券入關，關內則無一文匯來；其次爲辦理通匯的幾家銀行的門前，早晨四五點鐘即排有七八百投機商人，結果公務人員膽家費匯不出去，原因在於以流通券一千元，匯往關內，便可取一萬一千五百元法幣，較在瀋陽買暗盤要多賺二千四五百元。假使在關內以法幣一萬元經銀行匯來東北，在審陽能取流通券八百元，如由北平買黃金帶來東北，更多賺錢，瀋陽金價每偽滿券二萬九千五百元，約可賺萬元流通券，即將法幣一萬元帶來東北，可買流通券一千一百元，此項不完善通滙辦法，須急補救，否則投機之風將愈熾烈。</p>
<h3>政府將管制紗價　立院九人會昨提出討論每件將維持百五十萬元</h3>
<p>〔本報南京四日電〕立法院四日二時半舉行九人小組委會，出席張肇元，朱慶麟，孫九録等，討論管制紗價問題，經濟部王部長雲五出席報告，並研究辦法甚久，最後王氏表示：假定用配銷辦法使紗價維持每件一百五十五萬元，較爲妥適，倘商營紗廠不遵守，則政府即將作嚴重表示。討論至四時始散。記者訪原提案人孫九録，就詢討論經過，據談：民生條件不外乎衣食住行，衣之重要僅次於食，我國百分之七十以上爲農人，農民向以米爲標準物價，以米一石易布一疋，抗戰前米一石之價尚較高於布一疋之價，現在則布一疋之價已高過米一石之價四倍有餘，目前自仍應設法恢復以前之價，以維民生。本年六月前紗價每件二十支紗約一百二十萬左右，依其成本，用美棉三担半約三十五萬元，工繳約二十五萬，則每件不致超過六十萬元，僅售價之半，且所用美棉均購自行總，其需價且低於市塲價格，成本更可减小，行總計售出美棉一百五十萬担，如此則不但未能救濟人民，反使人民穿貴布而便利紗商獲暴利，此種現象，殊令人不解。又近數日美棉價稍高，每担約二十二萬元，滬用電辦法調整後，費用亦增，每件二十枝紗成本計美棉三担半，合七十七萬元，工廠約四十五萬元，折舊十萬元，總計亦不超過一百三十二萬元，而十月一日售價如二十支特雙馬竟達二百十萬元，利潤雖較六月稍少，但管理得宜，尚在百分之六十上下。基上原因，自應將紗價照實際成本加合法利潤予以管制，直接可以影響農民，不致繼續提高米價，間接可使一般物價與工價獲得穩定，故紗價管制實有立即決定必要。</p>

<h3>中共反美的真相　在秘密文件中暴露無遺</h3>
<p>〔中央社北平三日電〕此間某機關檢獲中國共產黨北平市工委宣傳部根據共黨中央「七一決定」向該黨各級黨委及全體黨員所印發秘密文件「關於反美工作的指示」，共黨在此文件中，坦白指出發動反美運動，係「爲了世界無產階級的利益」，因爲美國本質上是資本主義的國家，所以美國雖曾參加第二次世界大戰，但「美國是以法西斯代替法西斯」，現在新的反法西斯戰爭就要開始了，這個艱鉅任務，又落在中國共產黨身上，「故必須廣泛發動反美運動」可見，共黨反美運動實另有其更遠大的企圖。茲録原文如下：</p>
<p>對美工作的指示，根據目前國內國外的實際情况美帝國主義已經揭下了它的假面具，爲了反美帝國主義一切陰謀，爲了中國人民和世界無產階級的利益，我們必須立刻針對這一情况，決定我們鬥爭的方向，積極的打擊美國，孤立國民黨反動派，團結廣大民衆，在我黨的周圍，北平工委會特根據我黨中央賢明的「七一決定」，向各級黨委和全體黨員指示如下：</p>
<p>（一）我們必須清楚的認識美國本質上是資本主義的國家，這一基本性質決定了它的一切政策，不論它把民主喊的多響，它永遠去不掉帝國主義面目；這次反法西斯的世界戰爭中，雖然它是這一戰爭的組織者，但是它和盟國蘇聯之間，是有很明顯分歧點的，蘇聯是以消滅法西斯，奠世界和平，進而謀求全人類的解放；美國是以法西斯代替法西斯勢力，法掌握世界霸權，我們只要看看美國在德國佔領區和　　　　　管制下的日本種種事實，都是維持法西斯殘餘，使成爲美國保育下的「未來的力量」，這樣就證明了美國將要繼承法西斯主義衣缽，必然成爲未來戰爭威脅人類和平的領導者，這就是現在全世界仍然陷入在「第三次世界大戰」恐怖中的原因，這就是美國資本家反動派所給與人類和平的威脅。</p>
<p>（二）美國與國民黨反動派，自始至終即結了不可分的血緣關係，這是因爲它們本質上的資本主義的共同點，美國爲攬取東北廣大肥沃的土地和佔全個國百分之七十的東北工業設備，不惜援助國民黨軍隊，向東北進攻，貝爾納斯最近向國會提出的「軍事援華法案」，爲國民黨訓練一百萬軍隊這就表示美國直接帮助國民黨進行內戰美國倘然公開帮助國民黨進行內戰，及派馬歇爾作內戰調解，這並沒有什麼矛盾，馬歇爾的調停，正是帮助了國民黨，赫爾利不明白這種道理，想公開發動中國內戰，遭受了美國進步人士和中國人民的反對，下台滾蛋了，馬歇爾便換個方式來幹，但是他無論怎樣決不會放棄美國發動中國內戰的立塲的。嚴格說來，赫爾利還算坦白，馬歇爾則比較狡猾，我們必須清楚認識一切調解都是空言，我黨我軍絕不會受馬歇爾調解的欺騙，今後更應當警惕，不要麻木的去希望美國調解了。</p>
<p>（三）目前的情况是非常緊迫的，我黨和全國人民正遭遇着嚴重的危機，大規模的內戰，遲早必不可免，爲了我黨我軍的生存和無產階級的利益，我們必須向一切國外國內的反動派進擊，首先應將美帝國主義者陰謀向全國人民進行教育。以下是反美帝國主義宣傳的原則指示：（一）我各級幹部首先要在黨內加以動員，使我全體黨員在思想上認識目前的危機，把以前以盟友對待美國的心理轉換過來，並且教育民衆和自己，深切認識美帝國主義的反動面目，停止企圖依靠馬歇爾調解而復來和平錯誤心理，重新武裝，自己的頭腦，反對茍安僥倖的心理，進一步向民衆宣傳，美國已經在假面具下，進行協助中國內戰了，一切調停拖延，讓它去鬼混好了，我們只有動員人民準備新的反法西斯的民主戰爭，保衛抗日戰爭勝利的果實，這一宣傳的任務必須首先在黨內教育自己的工作做得好，才能保證對民衆的宣傳工作的效果。（二）用一切方式號召人民反對美帝國主義的侵略中國，助長中國內戰的陰謀，儘情揭發一切美國侵略事實，不法行爲，對美國的「偽君子面具」，在民衆的面前拉下來，今天北平的民衆，是才從日本的鐵蹄下解脫不久，對外國人的憎恨很深，現在日本人雖走了，又換來了美國人，我們亦使北平人民對日本人的仇恨，移植到美國人身上，使民衆以看日本人的眼光來看美國人，即是以美國人代替了日本人，一切的宣傳工作，除了儘量口頭的或文字的向各階層宣傳以外，特別應注意到各社會階級本身的觀點和不同的利害關係，分別去運用，在各學校各有黨細胞存在的機關，盡量和民主同盟取得個別連繋，發動民主以第三者的立塲去外，當更有效力，並且應當把宣傳和事實相連繋，更亦求配合宣傳工作，而展開民衆直接反美行動：（A）因爲美國的協助，內戰必然爆發，整個中國陷入混亂，一般民衆勢必因美國之侵略，八年來水深火熱的生活，又將到來，應號召民衆即刻以行動制止美國的陰謀，隨時將美國的「援華」暴行，向人民揭發把美軍壓迫同胞，侮辱中國女性，軍用車橫行，碰傷市民等事實，隨時向人民公佈，並且要儘可能糾合民衆在街頭，在戲院，飯館，舞塲，隨時制止美軍不法行爲，造成人民的行動表現，以提高反美情緒。（B）號召工人，民族資本家，商人，教育界人士，學生，指出美國經濟侵略的野心，絞殺中國工業，將使中國工業家破產，工人失業，教育凋敝，學生失學，惟有發動北平市各階級，以罷工，罷市，罷課一般來制止美國的陰謀。（C）利用一切可能伸入國民黨隊，進行宣傳，儘情揭發美國「軍事援華」陰謀，指出美國利用中國人打內戰，動員他們放下槍桿，反對內戰。（D）關於美國軍民指出美國反動的政策錯誤，號召美國士兵回國運動，並糾正他們對國民黨的正視，務使美國人對國民黨之間，造成矛盾，使民黨孤立，美國人相互之間，造成矛盾，使好戰派孤立。這一方式的運用，是多方面的，我們必須分化，打擊，拉攏，爭取並用，使那些不十分明白中國國情的在平各種美國人，在我們的政策下站立不定，動搖起來。</p>
<p>各級幹部同志們：我的反法西斯戰爭，就要開始了，這個艱鉅的任務，又落在中國共產黨身上了，爲了我黨的光明前途，我們必須將目前的「反對美帝國主義」運動，廣泛的開展起來。</p>
<p>社論</p>
<h3>撤除經濟上的人爲障碍</h3>
<p>勝利一年來的中國民族經濟，隨着國內政局的不安，始終呈著動搖不安的徵象。到了最近，這種經濟上的危機，益趨深刻。作爲民族經濟重心的上海，旣有工商業代表所組成的請願團入京請願於前，又有代表上海民意的參議會請願團入京請願於後，對面臨著上海乃至全國的經濟危機，促起我們的注意，希望政府的救援。我政府自　主席以次，對於請願團所陳各點，都能尊重民意，允加考慮，付諸實施。在宋院長與請願團談話時，宋氏並指出財政與經濟息息相關，財政若無辦法，經濟決難改善，反之，情形亦復相同。宋氏又指出一般人咸責政府祇重財政，忽視經濟，其實不盡然，倘使局勢澄清，經濟早已好轉。凡此所言，實在說明了目前的癥結，即目前經濟危難之加深，胥由於中國政局的未能澄清。政府尊重民意，博採與情，是則對於解救目前的經濟危難，深信必能於治本治標，兼　並顧，使我民族經濟生活轉趨於充沛活潑。</p>
<p>正在努力解救目前經濟危難的時候，我們看見有如下的報道：（一）據報載消息，香港政府曾派工商供應處副統制官赴日本，商洽日本紗布運港事宜，日前業已返港，即召集疋頭行商會負責人有所商討，並將日本帶回布樣數百種，供疋頭商人按樣選購。（二）廣州市紗商業同業工會，爲政院通過限制紗布運往閩粵事，電請上海市商會同情援助，籲請政府收回成命，俾物資得以交流，有無庶能相濟。（三）工商游資逃避香港，數月來達數百億元，近且有山東人某君向港政府登記成立一資本額達八億港元之企業公司。上面三則新聞，在今日國內外局勢紛攘不安之秋，未必爲世人所重視，然而其內在的含意，實在可以使我們長思。</p>
<p>在日寇被擊潰了的今日，我們民族的紡織工業本應該取日本紡織工業原有的地位而代之。祇因政府對於如何發展民族經濟沒有整個統盤的政策，所以縱有優良的計調或理想，往往不免　餅充饑。這固然多半由於國內局勢的未能澄清，致使若干幾經考慮而訂定的計劃，未能付諸實施；但我們若將一切責任歸諸局勢的未能澄清，似乎亦有失於公允。即在局勢未澄清的現勢下，政府應儘可能使我國幼稚而飽經憂患的民族工業轉趨於活潑。目前我國的紡織工業，雖因情勢的特殊，呈着畸形的繁榮，但從民族經濟的觀點，這未必一定是健康徵象。據日前宋院長向上海參議會請願團的表示，目前我國的情勢，華南較好，華北則因交通受阻，運輸不能暢通，生產受其影響。我們不慬爲什麼在情勢較好的華南，又要來一次人爲的障碍，使生產貿易趨於停滯？的確，目前橫置在中國民族經濟的危難，其由於人爲的障碍者或更甚於局勢的未臻澄清。高利貸的盛行，稅捐負担的不公，貿易壁壨的興築，凡此，均爲人爲的因素，似未許將它們完全轉嫁到政治局勢上去。</p>
<p>爲了要使我們的民族經濟趨於復甦，我們首先應該消除這些人爲的因素。因爲有這些人爲的障碍，我們看見有資金的逃避，生產貿易的萎縮。在這種情形之下，日本工業的重行獲取戰前的市塲和地位，勢將不可避免。我們若果失去了這千載一時的機會，則我們民族經濟的將來發展，將受到更嚴重的打擊。爲國家保留一分元氣，我們呼籲：趕快撤除這些人爲的障碍！</p>

<p>聯合國原子能管制委員會，於二日續開大會於紐約的成功湖。該會主席我國代表夏晋麟博士，於討論開始時，提醒各國代表稱：過去歷次會議均未獲重要成就，故今後必需自一般原則進入實際問題，並獲致成果。旋又提出建議，應挅取有力方策，解決各國異見。這些口吻出諸我國代表而同時又爲聯合國原子能管制委員會主席的夏晋麟博士之口，實在足以象徵我立國精神的崇高，應該博得一般世人的讚佩。</p>
<p>自從美軍在廣島長崎投下了原子炸彈以後，人類已進入了一個新的時代。原子能的利用，可能爲人類帶來無窮的幸福，同時也可能毀滅整個人類及其所創造的文明。關於如何管制原子能的利用，因爲英美加在戰時曾合力於原子炸彈的製造，而蘇聯則不曾參加，故彼此間頗持異見。實則原子能的利用，像其它科學發明一樣，原是各國科學家研究的積聚，這裏本沒有什麼秘密。祇　　原子炸彈的製造方面，或許有若干技術上的問題，未爲一般科學家所習知。因爲蘇聯不曾參加原子炸彈的製造，而原子炸彈的使用又將使未來的戰爭完全改觀，故蘇聯主張禁止原子能武器的製造與使用，並須在三月內將現存原子能武器材料消毀。此項主張之被提出，所具理由自然顯而易見，而其未能爲英美方面所接受，自又在意想之中，在英美，它們所着重是管制而不是廢止，這與蘇聯的見解，自然根本不能協調。因爲有這種異見存在，所以聯合國原子能管制委員會的一再召開，初未能成立任何協議。在此情勢之下，我們樂聞大會主席我國代表夏晋麟博士的指陳。我國在實際上沒有參加原子炸彈的製造，所處境地，正與蘇聯相同。旣有關於管制原子能不同的異見，以我國所處地位的超然，深願能將異見的距離縮短起來，能够在原子能的管制上，獲致寶貴的協議。</p>
<p>然而關於原子能的管制之所以有異見者，問題當然不在原子能本身，應於它處求之。原子能的管制，不過被大家認作爲一個皮球，供彼此踢來踢去而已。禁止原子能的利用，等於因噎　食，似乎不足爲法。因爲原子能的利用，也可能帶給人類以無窮的幸福。所以我們此際應該管制原子能的利用，使原子能的利用能從毀滅的方面轉到增進人類幸福的方面，那纔是造物的真意，人類的進步。</p>

<h3>長江埠接受舞弊　小軍官膽大妄爲</h3>
<p>〔本報漢口三日電〕湘鄂　區清查團委員苗培成·何漢文·頃自應城長江埠査案歸來，對記者發表此次淸査軍人盜賣物資經過如下：緣該團前據密報：</p>
<p>價值二十億元</p>
<p>「應城縣長江埠爲漢宜路之重鎭，淪陷時敵人在該處建築營房，儲有大量物資，敵人投降後，先入該鎭接牧者爲七十五軍之工兵營營長孫子炎，連長金士相·陳大振等，所有接收物資，據鄕人估計最少在二十億元以上，該營對於此項接收物資，陸績盜運盜賣，迄今已逾一年，雖部隊早已開拔，猶復擅設留守處，繼續盜賣物資，負此責任者爲管理員趙懿釗，排長兪立山，近以物資行將盜賣完畢，乃更拆毁房屋，將材料賣與當地百姓」云云，該團得訊後，即由委員苗培成·何漢文·於本月二日率領行轅軍法處檢察官姚崇賢及憲兵等，赴長江埠實地調査，於今晚公畢返漢，査得結果：（一）關於隱藏盜賣及毁棄接收敵人物資部份：（甲）鎭郊江面停有馬達木船十五艘，且有數艘已經破沉水內，細察此項船舶之標誌，均爲敵品，而該營竟久予棄置，任其毁壞，旣不報吿亦不修理，殊有意暴棄接收物資，且此十一艘馬達木船，據當地人民稱，敵人在時便有的，該營更有對接收敵人物資隱匿不報之重大嫌疑。（乙）在該工兵營留守處放存零星物資甚多，其較爲重要而顯爲敵人遺留者，有折疊船五具，折疊船馬達三具，起重機一具，各種車船用油三十餘桶，共儲十一室。</p>
<h3>私售　確有其事</h3>
<p>（丙）關於盜賣及運走所有接收物資情形，據兪立山供稱，係運至武昌連魚套師部倉庫儲存，惟究已運走若干，並無淸册可査，至陸續將日用物品在該鎭私售一節，本地人民多稱確有其事。（二）關於拆毁房屋事，據査：敵人在長江埠所修營房，原均完好，且地下鋪有地板及日本章蓆等，自該營駐該　後，陸續拆毁，迨最近正式移交長江鉋鎭公所，不惟其地板草蓆已全歸烏有，其房屋亦多破壞不堪，至勘查時止，尚有拆卸之木料甚多，儲存一室，似此種于種事實。該留守處實係私自拆毀營房，並將其材料變賣圖利無疑。又苗何兩委員抵該處査詢時，處內凌亂不堪，無一人負責，迨數次派人尋找該處負責排長兪立山談話，乃該兪立山竟以與其同僚打牌，謂未打完不能來，當以該兪立山等不惟目無法紀。且公然妨礙公務，乃由行轅軍法處檢察官姚崇賢等將其當塲拿獲，即日解行轅軍法處訊辦，聞淸査團對於本案，除該排長兪立山等四人賭博部份已由軍法處訊辦外，關於該七十五師工兵營長孫子炎，連長金士相·陳大振，排長兪立山，管理員趙懿釗均有其應負之責任，已於昨日將全案送請武漢行轅核辦。</p>

<p>殭化了的郊區交通</p>
<p>本市之公共交通情形，雖不能令人十分滿意，但中區之公共車輛，已增至相當數量，而市郊及稍爲偏僻之地區，其公共交通，始終未見開展，尤其市中心區等地，戰前居戶甚多，且曾爲新上海建設計劃之中樞，現在即有很多戰前居民，希冀返歸原處，徒以交通不便，治安未固，未敢成行。按戰前該區有華商公共汽車公司車輛行駛，路綫自北站繩寳山路·江灣路·西體育會路與中區（前租界）連繫，居民稱便，紛紛向市中心區遷移，以致造成戰前新興之象。即在日寇盤據期間，亦有公共車輛行駛，且有所謂「新興站」之設立，不意勝利一年後之今日，非但戰前之交通未見恢復，即日寇已具之規模，亦已蕩然，誠屬遺憾。日前聞公用局令英商公共汽車公司立即復業，並限十一月前答覆，而對華商公共汽車公司之復業問題，則又諱莫如深，數月前曾見報載該公司經理王某，自美返國，計劃公司復業事，迄今未見下文，不知何故？際此市區房荒嚴重，當局獎勵戰前居民返歸重建房屋之時，未識對此確立交通之先決問題已定有若何辦法否？（偉哲生）</p>
<p>速發國民身份證！</p>
<p>鄙人等是蘇北淮安的一羣流亡者，居住常州，瞬已年餘，上月國軍已進入淮安故鄉，正準備束裝繞道返里，適獲徐州友人來函，云及沿途經我國軍保護之下，並無其他意外，唯由徐州乘汽車，必須携帶國民身份證方能登車，檢査非常嚴緊，但國民身份證祇有京滬鎭三大都會發給，其他京滬綫上各縣尙未着手，我等流亡各縣難民非屬寥寥，誰不思鄉心切？希望各縣行政長官，即速辦理該證，俾得落難同胞，早日重返家園，骨肉團聚。（顏謙益）</p>
<p>黌宮雖好苦無居！</p>
<p>記得在兩個多月以前，我爲了投考交大，曾過着我生平最緊張最堅苦的生活，日以繼夜地整整預備了一個月的功課。在盛暑下我忍受了許多旅途的艱辛，從宜興趕到上海居然徼倖的考取了工業管理，當時我內心興奮異常，因爲這是我從堅苦中得來的一點收穫啊！</p>
<p>但是不幸的事情又來了，在交大的招生廣吿上，不是高掛着「錄取新生一律通學」的牌子嗎？在以前我還幻想着交大當局或能設法變通，可是現在呢？又成泡影，試想淸寒得連金屑都沒有的我，又豈能解決這個動輒以金條爲條件的住宿問題呢？眼見　舍巍峨，祇苦難渡過這一重難關！</p>
<p>我想交大錄取的七百九十二位同學中，除却極少數的居滬同學外，都在爲着這沒有居處而焦急。我們不願因爲這一點沒有住所的困難就逼着放棄學業所以希望各界關懷學子的人們賜給我們一個適當的辦法。（宜興學生史曾堯）</p>

<h3>莫落托夫返國請示　三巨頭會晤說甚囂鏖上</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕巴黎四日廣播：巴黎和會蘇聯代表莫洛托夫，今日第二次飛返莫斯科，向史達林有所請示。惟可望於下週返巴黎，爲和會全體會議之主席。莫氏此行引起一般人對於史達林。艾德禮及杜魯門可能在最近將來召開三巨頭會議之猜測。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦四日廣播：貝爾納斯今與貝文晤談，商討下月召開之四强外長會議程序問題</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓三日電〕美英非官塲方面日來要求修改對蘇政策，已引起此間外交家中硏究兩項問題，即英國是否在醖釀修改對美蘇兩國關係，英國是否即將出任居間，拉撞美蘇。英前外相艾登曾主張以新精神及新途徑與蘇聯修好，艾登發言之翌日，蘇聯委長史達林即表示歡迎，邇來英國報紙已有一部份贊成艾登主張，其嚴　抨擊美對蘇繼續推行强硬政策者亦不在少數，甚有謂美國務卿貝爾納斯已有過甚之處者。例如倫或泰晤士報稱，艾登與史達林此呼彼應之言論，實爲及時恢復大衆渴望之穩健關係之信號。惟倫敦興論界雖有如此呼聲，華盛頓方面英國官員仍堅決聲明該國政府不擬變更外交政策，謂倫敦方面之呼聲不過爲政治作用，艾登即使再長外交，亦不致能使英外交政策作重大之改變云。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕巴黎四日廣播：蘇聯於和會委員工作結束之際，再度對美國作憤激的攻擊，責指美國破壞四强協議，並企岡自義大利獲得經濟特權。莫洛托夫飛往莫斯科後，改由蘇代表阿朗丁寗領導發言，當討論澳洲所提組織特別賠償委員會以處理義大利賠款，而由美代表任主席之提案時，阿氏大肆抨擊，因美國單獨放棄向義大利索取賠償，倘由美國任主席，將予美國以「特殊權力」。當委員會以十二對八票通過該提案時，阿朗丁寗乃竭力抨擊美國違反和約草案不得修改之四强協議。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕巴黎四日廣播：和會軍事委員會通審舉行會議，歷時九小時五十五分以後，於今晨提出其關於五國和約軍事方面之最後報吿，雖經蘇聯集團對於該報吿頗多反對，指其違反四强決議，但軍事委會卒以十五票對六票通過其報吿。六反對票係蘇聯，白俄羅斯，烏克蘭，南斯拉夫及捷克所投。蘇聯集團所反對最烈者，爲色雷斯希臘邊境保加利亞方面之全部解除軍備，及禁止保加利亞置有水雷艇兩項建議。</p>

<h3>滬各界痛悼李聞　潘議長在大會中演講　闡述民主真諦　努力使中國和平統一　以慰死者於九泉之下</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市各界昨日上午九時，在天蟾舞台舉行李公樸，聞一多二氏追悼大會，參加者極爲擁擠，的四千餘人。會塲佈置莊嚴，台正中設祭臺，牆上縣方花格李聞二氏彩色大畫像二張，塲中四壁遍掛輓聯。主席團有各黨各派代表分坐台之左右。由吳市長任主席，沈鈞儒主祭，潘公展，吳開先，黃炎培，羅隆基，史良，鄧頴超，徐寄廎，郭沫若，張君勱，章伯鈞，楚圖南，章乃器，馬叙倫，蔡廷鍇，洪深等陪祭。</p>
<p>趙丹讀祭文後，吳市長即致詞稱：「李聞二氏，均爲我好友，尤以聞先生係我淸華同班同學，今天以友好兼市長身份追悼兩位，更爲痛惜」。並說明兩點：（一）李聞兩先生是爲民主而死，上海民主基礎業已奠立，英美有民意機構，上海市參議會成立？亦不多議，此可吿慰於二氏。（二）民主應有守法精神，李聞兩先生之死，乃死於不守法者手下，故更應提倡法治。繼之史良女士報吿李公樸氏生平及被害經過。楚圖南敎授則叙述聞一多先生一生清貧生活刻苦精神。</p>
<p>當潘議長公展被邀起立演講時，全場掌聲雷動。潘氏沉痛聲稱：「今天上海市各界追悼李公樸聞一多兩先生，相信不但在座者表示悲痛，上海市民當聽到李聞兩先生先後被售消息，都在痛惜爲國家珍惜人才。本人與李先生有二十年之交情，與聞先生雖未見面，但拜讀聞氏大作亦有二十年之久。兩先生辦敎育，寫文章，本人以朋友及同樣職業者來參加此會，覺得格外傷感。兩先生爲求取民主而捐軀，是國家的損失，自應同聲一哭。惟念我們欲求取民主，應知道如何去求，只要能把中國造成一個民主，和平，統一，強大的國家，那末兩先生死在九泉之下，也可瞑目（台上下熱烈鼓掌）。我們後死者，沒有其他來安慰他們，祇能大家以一切可能的方法，去達到這個目的。但要使中國走上民主的大道，也不是容易的。中國國家自有文字以來，已有幾千年的歷史，是一個古老舊式的國家，要翻身而改造成功一個民主的現代國家，當是何等的艱難啊！國父孫中山先生領導國民黨，五十年來的革命，爲三民主義而奮鬥，就是要建設一個民主的現代的新中國。（大鼓掌）然而「民主」「民主」，在今天的世界上，解釋也各有不同。美國人說美國的民主是典型的民主，蘇聯人又說蘇聯的民主是最新的民主，究竟那種制度對呢？趙丹先生所讀祭文中，說到「美蘇之橋樑」。對啊！我們中國應做美蘇之橋棵。不但在國際局勢中做美蘇之橋樑，即在民主制度上也應做美蘇之橋樑。我們立國的三民主義，才眞是美蘇的橋樑！（全塲一再鼓掌，呼叫擁護）。如果單獨的死學美國，或偏頗的硬跟蘇聯，都不配做美蘇之橋樑。中國要民主，就祗有誠心誠意的實行三民主義。而最重要的，大家應該養成二種風度：一是容許人們可以自由說話，自山批評和討論的風度；一是說話批評的人自有分寸自負責任的風度。今天的中國，那一個地方，如果祗有一方面的州言論，而不許其他意見發表，祗許一個黨派存在、而不見有其他黨派活動，那個地方就不是民主。（大鼓掌）眞正的民主典型，大槪倒是在今天的會塲了。今天在座，有各黨各派的人，有無無黨無派的人，大家說話，彼此尊重，表現着眞正的民主。李聞二先生所捐軀以求者爲民主，我們來追悼他們，就該在這種意義下，共同努力，使中國和平統一，實現三民主義，方可無愧於兩先生」（大鼓掌）</p>
<p>郭沫若</p>
<p>氏繼起演講，手持一講稿朗誦，痛述李聞偉大精神，並說外國人批評我國人自私自利，消極的自私自利是「明哲保身」積極的自私自利是「寗我負人」，而最後以孔子耶穌比擬李聞二氏。鄧頴超女士代表周恩來到塲，讀悼詞一首，詞曰：「今天在此追悼李公樸，聞一多兩先生，時局極端險惡，人心異常悲憤。但此時此地，又有何話可說？我謹以最虔誠的信念，向殉道者默誓：心不死，志不絕，和平可期，民主有望，殺人者終必覆滅！」</p>
<p>羅隆基</p>
<p>氏，以與李聞二先生相處甚久，交誼甚深，表示將外哀痛，但他說「今天我們在此不是哀悼，而是慶賀我們有這兩位朋友的精神不死。他們早就準備爲民主而犧牲的。他並說：我們要的民主是要老百姓能活。中山先生遺教中說：「和平民主救中國」，要和平才有民主。</p>
<p>最後</p>
<p>李公樸夫人張曼筠女士，代表李聞二氏家屬致謝詞，聲淚俱下，對於政府首長，友好，來賓熱心參加協助舉行此令，表示萬分感謝。並謂；「經此使我更相信他們並沒有死，他們的精神將永遠在每個人心中，不會忘記」。追悼會於十一時奏哀樂後始散。</p>

<p>首由潘議長致詞略稱：台灣與祖國隔離五十年之久，經此次抗戰後始得仍回祖國懷抱，全國同胞不僅爲台胞慶幸。並爲自身而慶祝。相信各位先生在抗戰八年之後對於祖國定有深刻認識。目前台灣行政·經濟·政治擬在過渡時期，亦相信台灣同胞希望一切制度能和國內其他各地相同，此點將來必能達到，並可表示中國是一整個統一之國家云。繼由代表團團長林獻堂致詞，謂台灣在過去八年，幸賴全國軍民之奮鬥抗戰，卒獲光復。過去五十年間，台胞受日人之奴化政策，嘗盡敵人摧殘威迫，但我們始終努力團結，保持固有文化。今日台灣回到祖國懷抱，如小弟弟一般，希望老大哥多多指敎領導，共同努力建設新國家，國內糾紛趕快和平解決，使建設有望，亦是台灣六百卅萬同胞所一致希望云云。繼由代表團顧問丘念先報吿觀感四點：（一）此次回到祖國，感覺親切熱誠，使我等一享家庭溫暖。（二）台胞在過去五十年，因受日人離間，致頗多隔膜，但現在已瞭解了。（三）同人等來到祖國見到一家兄弟吵架，覺得很傷心，我們吃過五十年亡國痛苦，深切希望國家應趕快走上强國之途。（四）希望國家趕快求得和平，重事建汉。並希望國內同胞勿歧視合胞，事實上六百卅萬台胞全係純粹中國民族也。</p>
<p>後由陳圻氏代表答覆記者所詢台灣工商業情形稱：目前工商業尙在接收過程中，其延遲不上轉道之原因，在於過去工商業全在　人手中，一且接收，人力財力均感不足。以後宜分二個階段發展：（一）完成接收工作，繼續生產，（二）恢復戰前狀態。（三）改良及增進生產。</p>
<p>參政員陳逸松答覆關於台灣行政長官公署發表個人意見謂：（一）台灣令體人民都希望中央能撤銷行政長官公署制度，而設置省政府制度。（二）長官陳儀道德學問均好，惟因理想太多，不切實際，故徒然造成官僚制度。</p>
<p>最後潘議長以新聞界一員之立塲，希望不久將來，京滬記者能組織一台灣觀光團，願與代表等在台灣再見云。</p>

<p>游資流到　本省鄉村</p>

<h3>張北生等羣奸今日由蘇解滬</h3>
<p>〔本報蘇州四日電〕蘇高院定五日晨八時五十分常滬二三等區間車，將已確定判決之漢奸犯四十名，移押上海，漲三監典獄長陳松年，響記官項鑑率法警負責押送，約十二時可抵北站，然後移提籃橋監獄執行。內有偽江蔣民政蔣長張逆北生及江都偽縣長潘宏器等奸逆。陳　君陳　民等各奸均不在內。</p>
<h3>偽府一巨頭陣春圃死刑　偽保甲委員陳九峯口供　指出數參議員曾爲舊日同僚</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕汪逆精衛之內戚，僞府巨頭之一陳春圖，昨日下午由高院判處極刑。主文：陳春國通謀敵國，圖謀反抗本國，處死刑，褫奪公權終身，全部財產除酌留家屬必需生活費外，沒收。陳昨衣靑灰華達呢長衫，鼻架無邊眼鏡，聞判猶强作鎭定，未作表示。仍由法警押　監獄。按陳四十七歲，廣東新會人，係國民黨員，歷久供職於黨政各機關，迨抗戰軍興，汪逆勾結日寇，叛國求和，陳即於民國廿七年十二月先汪逆而離渝。嗣汪逆在滬與敵寇商訂「和平基礎方案」，籌組僞府，陳又充其私人秘書，追隨左右。至廿九年三月出任僞行政院秘書長，兼僞政治委員會副秘書長及僞中央執行委員會執行委員與副秘書長。三十一年十月調偽建設部部長，三十二年兼僞中央黨部組織部長，三十三年四月調僞廣東省省長兼綏靖主任，至三十四年二月交卸，改任僞國民政府委員，直至勝利爲止。勝利後被捕，移送高檢處偵査，提起公訴。</p>
<p>又僞警局職員金耕心漢奸嫌疑案，昨日判決：管轄錯誤，係普通刑事，移送地方法院審理。</p>
<p>陳九峯，現年四十歲，浙江上虞人·大夏大學法律系畢業，前在滬經營實業，敵僞盤據期間，因曾任「上海市民聯合籌備委負會」書記及「上海市保甲自治籌備委員會總幹事等職，勝利後被捕，由高檢處提起公訴。檢察官之起訴書控以負責編査戶口，發領市民證，妨礙愛國份子及地下工作人員在滬之活動，陳昨在高院審訊時滔滔辯稱：卅一年二月十四日老閘區被敵封鎖，引起嚴重之食糧恐慌，爲求解除此類恐怖封鎖，因而有保甲自治籌備委員會之發起與組織，被吿亦爲在對鎖區內之居民，故其參加原因，一方面受環境影響，一方面亦係爲大衆解除痛苦。但該會係人民團體，並非僞組織所屬之機關。「保甲自治籌備委員會」之主任委員係袁履登，副主任委員係周邦俊·余華龍兩人，後「保甲委員會」之主席則爲葉扶臀，副主席爲王伯元·王廉方兩人。當時之二萬名保甲長，勝利後仍在做下去。被吿在押已一年，亦未聞有當時之保甲委員被檢舉爲漢奸，祗聽得某人已被選爲市參議員，某人已升任官職。據被吿所知，現任市參議員中過去參加是項保甲者甚多，如李文杰。郭琳爽等皆爲當時之委員。郭順且已去美國，爲何被吿獨被扣押而欲論罪，眞是莫名其妙，本人絕對不認爲有罪云。又白俄僑民聯誼會秘書克撲夫，被控與敵軍部勾結，謀害反日之前任數會長伊凡諾夫等，被吿否認。以上兩案昨均審結，定本月十一日下午二時宣判。</p>
<p>同日高院調査俄僑勿爾溜勒荷夫被控充任靜安寺路敵軍部無綫電台情報員案，及華僑張宜昌在菲律濱馬尼刺爲敵作調査工作，傅光耀以物資敵等數案，均改期再訊。</p>

<p>被吿律師聆悉歐本之證飼後，即力謀證明其言之不足置信，並提出證件，證明歐本於一九三六年曾在奧以販毒之罪而被驅逐出境。彼等稱歐本會服務於美軍防瘧隊，在江灣宿舍注射DDT，至爲美軍遠捕時始止。其後則爲美海　雇用，曾參加調査梅里尼案之工作。</p>
<p>昨最審訊時被傳之第二證人，爲前日本駐滬軍部報導部部長谷中佐，彼係新由日本解滬，於作證時稱；德國投降後，彼曾與本案被吿歐哈　，李然坦，哈本尼然德等有所往還。</p>
<h3>山西北路盜刦</h3>

<h3>周家嘴路一老叟　斯文落魄投繯死</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕虹口新建路周家嘴路水門汀上，昨晨拂曉，發現一老叟，預　縄索，奄奄待斃。八時半，提籃橋分局據報後，飭警員李少棠馳往調査，該叟上服灰布短衫，下着白布短袴，和尙頭，赤脚，體胖，鬚長三寸，指甲長寸許，年約六十餘歲，當時尙微有氣息，迨軍送市立第五醫院施治，到院僅一小時即行氣絕，淮査無家屬。據承辦斯案之　員云；此叟決非勒斃，因死者前頸有繩痕，後頸毫無，生前似爲一斯文者流，或係落魄後投繯自縊。經人移往該處云。</p>
<h3>外商船裝卸工人　怠工仲裁未解決</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕輪船裝卸工人，要求增加工資，由每工四千加至六千元，經裝卸業公會出任向各洋商輪船公司交涉無結果，於二日起怠工，各洋商已請求社會局仲裁，迄未解決。招商局原定今日接收自加拿大購來之海杭輪，因裝卸工人怠工，來貨尙未卸淸，故改期再行接收。據悉此次怠工，僅限外輪，國輪尙無影響，惟據工人方面消息，如不早日解決，恐國輪亦將波及。</p>
<h3>人面霓虹相映紅　依然禁令耳邊風</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕公用局已正式公吿，自十月一日起，所有屋外霓虹燈裝飾燈，一律暫停供給電力。但入夜，電虹燈仍然向行人雲眼，電燈牌樓依舊令人目眩。據悉公用局已請警察局協助執行，並通令市商會轉囑各商業同業公會，曉諭本市各店家遵行。唯此僅爲解除本市電荒之臨時辦法，並非拆除各店裝置之霓虹燈及裝飾燈，僅係暫停使用。一般店家頗有不明眞相者。</p>
<h3>美軍法庭二次提審　德國特工案　證人歐本供述　間諜活動情形</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕美軍法庭昨第二次提審德特工嫌疑犯，證人歐本稱：沈克（即前曾控美記者侖道爾誹謗之另一德戰爭嫌疑犯）曾奉德國特工機關歐哈德局之命，試行設法使歐本進入我國內地，刺探美軍情報。戰事發生時，歐本曾自稱美籍，故亦爲日軍拘入浦東集中營，沈克乃與日憲兵隊接洽，擬使歐本自集中營逃出，而以美國人民之身份，偸往內地，從事諜報。但此計劃卒未實現。</p>
<p>歐本狀頗萎靡，白髮盈頭，陳述其過去奉歐哈德特工局之命，從事在華之種種間諜活動時，極爲生動。彼稱照空和尙（又名德雷維區林肯）及在本市行醫之梅里尼翳師，皆係間諜，而梅里尼後即爲歐哈德局人員暗殺。</p>
<p>歐本稱：歐哈德局之工作，在德國投降後，仍照常進行，據稱彼於去年八月十七日曾與本案另一被吿魯道洛夫相過，魯氏當即吿彼謂該局之活動，於二日前始行停止。本市納粹德僑，當時均由本市秘密警察領袖卡納之掩護，而卡納實歐本最親密友人之一。歐本指被吿哈本尼希德爲歐哈德局第二名領袖，專門負責搜集軍事情報。另一被吿貝希克則不特爲顯微攝影（將照片縮至極小）專家，且能僞造各種文件，並曾爲歐本僞造某葡輪醫師之證明書。</p>
<p>歐本於答覆被吿律師盤詰時，謂歐哈德局每一人負，必須宣誓，不得顧問其他人員之事務。</p>
<p>歐本謂本案另一被吿摩斯堡，係將諜報方法授彼本人之人，摩氏曾命其「盡量避免誑語，尤以一般易於證明爲虛僞之事，此點更爲重要。」</p>
<h3>不認糟糠　對簿公堂　一件「抗戰夫人」案　一別十五載但見新人笑不聞舊人哭　小脚娘控告航空機械員重婚遺棄</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕地院昨審一重婚案，原吿爲一身穿藍布短襖，黑布褲小脚之中年娘姨。被吿爲一身穿黃卡其美式空軍制服，雄糾糾，氣昂昂，儼然飛將軍之中國航空公司機械員。古典美人與現代英雄，雙雙對簿於公堂之前。原吿供稱：名周錢銀仙，南通人，年三十六歲，早歲入海門周家爲童養媳，民國十九與其夫周忠明結婚，曾生一孩，數月夭折，民國二十年其夫即離家投軍，一別十五載，魚沉雁落，竟遺棄不顧，因不堪姑翁虐待，乃來滬爲傭，後探悉其夫在渝，並悉其已另娶「抗戰夫人」，曾一度書信交涉，奈因關山險阻，無法尋夫，勝利後周忠明偕「抗戰夫人」來滬，經鄉友告知，即前往交涉，周忠明非唯不肯瞻養，反不認前妻，停妻再娶，實搆成重婚罪。周錢銀仙供畢，並呈庭上一證件，爲其夫周忠明寄予錢母之函件，信中措詞足證周錢確爲夫婦。被告周忠明稱：自訴人係其童養媳，並未結婚，故雖有夫婦之名，而無夫婦之實，育孩之事，毫無根據，顯係盧搆。庭上以錢女有信件爲證，事實明顯，乃諭先行庭外和解，若和解不成，改期再訊。</p>

<h3>昆明秋聲賦</h3>
<p>— 九月八日昆明航訊　徐繼</p>
<p>是雨季的末期了，一抹陽光。不時細雨濛濛，把地面噴得濕漉漉　，固然，這對於行路人有一　小小的不便，可是在天候方面說，倒是敎人感到滿寫意，有風，有雨，還右陽光，京滬一帶哪能企求得到？</p>
<p>跨過雨季，便將是一連串的好睛天，昆明的氣候確實無話可說，試問全中國能有幾個地方在大熱天裘可以蒙着被頭睡覺？秋來以後，一早一晚，顯得更寒冷了。女士們已經在展示她們的新裝，輕盈地，炫奇地，給無衣者是一點提示，是一點威脅，還不大弄得分明，穿新衣服的人漸漸多起來了，只是街的另一端却正也有人扯起衣領，默默無言地沉思。你道想些什麽？想的是：「全家都在西風裏，九月寒衣未剪裁！」</p>
<p>一紙禁舞令　不聞蓬拆聲</p>
<p>少爺小姐們却實在悶的發慌了，十一家舞廳一齊關了門，脚　據地，街頭的播音器裏響起了一支華爾滋，人會不自覺地在水門汀人行道上，有節拍地閃動幾下，野小孩癡瞪着眼，才使人陡地想起昆明早就沒有舞廳了啊！</p>
<p>曉東街和太和街都寂寞了。街頭從茲不聞蓬拆之聲，「匹卡撲」裏偶爾也傳出幾聲南美　曲，然而再也無法使「舞國臣民」無忌地放開步子了，代之而興的是淸唱，是雜耍，但是它不像探戈，浪擺那樣迷惑着人，「聲聲細，步步嬌……」那份滋味怎好重溫！游藝塲的出現，只不過是過渡而已，人們走過曉東街時，只好看看窗櫥中陳列的玻璃物品，嘸啥苗頭。</p>
<p>昆明現有娛樂塲所十二家，人口却還不到三十萬，自然，消遺的地方不能算少，只是偏於地方性的玩意，欣賞的人到底不多，重趣味的雜耍，只是小市民的恩物，說京戲麼？一共三家，雲南和西南兩家園子的「穿金寳扇」與「石猴出世」會演個沒完，幾個角色也老是固定的，很自然的，電影塲便算是唯一消遣的所在了。</p>
<p>然而，厄運似乎緊跟着昆明的娛樂，八大公司和院方的外片糾紛問題一直是　夾不淸，公司方面的條件是够苛刻的，被此利益有了衝突，自然很難談得攏，一再僵持，弄得下文不明，總之，兩月來，昆明影院裏不曾看到大腿歌舞，有的僅是共和，鷹獅，蘇聯，印度以及國產影片公司找得了出路。</p>
<p>午夜鎗聲響　司機殺主人</p>
<p>山城的雨季沒有完，新聞也不會有個終結。新中國劇社的「桃花扇」「陳圓圓」古裝劇，正一連上演得起勁，就在八月二十五日晚散塲的那一天，午夜又傳鎗聲，小轎車的司機竟將主人太太打傷了，太太的名字是孫多蘭，係河南國大代表，爲前行營參謀長劉師尙夫人，同時被鎗擊的還有劉志寰。劉係四川人，爲前靑年團幹事，因爲男女雙方都是「公職」中人，自然外間便免不了很多揣測，孫多蘭住所在近郊大觀路尙園，那正是鎗殺案發生的地點。一輛小汽車陡地停了下來，司機說是看看油箱，然而跟着槍聲突作，中彈的地點都在面部，由劉志寰的右腮穿入，舌頭也去了半截，孫多蘭則一彈擊中頭部，一中左面頰，一共四彈，兩人秋色平分，說來倒也是够巧妙的。</p>
<p>劉志寰到底是上過陣的人，中彈後還餘勇可鼓，跳下車來，便直朝兇手猛撲，一連跑了幾十步路，到底不支倒下來了，當夜男女主角都被抬進了昆華醫院。記者第二天一早跑去，却都已包紥好，脫離危險時間了。醫生不允許我們多談話，一時也還感到茫然，幸好兇手李恒是翌晨六時在川滇鐵路車站附近逮住的，想想還是等口供再來描寫案情吧。</p>
<p>市警察總局當天便審問了這件案子，兇手李恒，廿六歲，是河北大名縣人，他慷概陳詞，劈頭便說：「劉志寰與太太(指孫多蘭，因孫係其主人劉參謀長的太太）早就有「不名譽」的行爲，我槍殺劉志寰，只是要對得住參謀長，以平心頭之慎，如今事發，即令是槍斃我，亦所甘心」！接着又問他是否有人主使？李恒的嗓子更　亮了，「好漢作事好漢當，這事全係個人自己的主意，絕無他人嗷使。「跟着他便說起殺人的輕過和動機，「廿五日晚上七點鐘，劉志實便到尙園（係多蘭寓所）來了，太太說今天要去看話劇，要我開車子進城，當時我便看不慣他們那種親　的樣子，但終於强忍住把他們送進戲院，心裏氣忿不已，十兩酒，半斤牛肉，下了肚後，殺機已起，在事後倉裏躺着直等到戲終塲，他們在車中的情景越發敎我看不下去了，以此拔槍就打，原不想傷及太太，只是因爲喝多了酒，便把握不住自己了」。</p>
<p>案情問完，還不曾決定如何發落，但男女主角的傷勢却已經差不多快要痊可了。</p>
<h3>山色湖光一片秋　西子易裝</h3>
<p>— 九月三十日杭州訊　本報特派員儲裕生</p>
<p>西子湖的水老是像一鍋子熱水，掙不脫夏的懷抱，原來今年的秋，姗姗來遲，杭州的秋季香汎（農歷七月間）受了影響，西子湖「要子」（杭州俗語指玩的意思）的人，也就减少了不少。河濱路，多的倒是乞丐們。湖濱的旅館和吃食店生意，都不見得好。</p>
<p>幸虧農曆八月十入日的浙江潮汎，才把四方八面的遊客吸引到杭州來，但天氣還是熱得很，看了潮匆匆的又走了。</p>
<p>這幾天來，天氣已在漸漸地凉了。西子已經更易了秋裝，那白堤蘇堤上的柳枝，已經由翠綠而變換了深綠色了，在裏西湖裏，再也看不到荷花，儘是許多荷葉，它已經漸漸地衰老了。滿覺隴的桂花也凋殘了。幾處楓葉，已開始它的黃金時代。夜深時，湖濱公園散步的人不多了，划子兜攬客人也沒有什麽力氣了。公園襄的圓柱燈，不像以前樣的輝煌。</p>
<p>工商幕後多悲凉</p>
<p>商店裏的東西眞便宣哪。單拿文具講，派克墨水僅賣六百元一瓶，那些民生一類的墨水已經黯然失色。玻璃褲帶早已打垮了皮帶，玻璃皮包風行一時，各家皮鞋店大家都在大廉價，皮包皮帶特別便宜。在中秋節前，聽說有很多家大商店支持不下去，但現在總算支持下去了。支持雖然支持下去了，他們背後還是很悲凉呢。第一，許多特產因爲內亂的關係，不能外銷。第二，外國貨價廉物美，中國貨成本過高，不能抗衡。第三，人工過貴，職工們天天嚷加薪，資本短絀。這實在是今天杭州工商業的慘象，不可不加以注意。</p>
<p>高利貸由紅轉殘</p>
<p>杭州的「高利貸」也曾經紅極一時的，一角二角的不算希奇，我曉得有幾個地方是從銀行裏借款子來，再放高利貸以維持經費的。殊不知被放高利貸的人，再放高利貸，因此，重重的高利貸，重重的剝創老百姓，最近許多高利貸者也沒有了出路。第一，因爲窮人錯不起高利貸，還是不借的好。第二，事業前途無把握，何必去借高利貸。第三，囤貨的人覺得無貨可囤，囤了或許因爲外貨侵入，會得虧本，所以還是不囤貨。第四新毅登塲，囤米的人要趕緊拋出來。第五，目前物價是在循序的漲，沒有狂跳。這許多高利貸沒有了出路，於是柬闖西突，販些外國貨來買賣。至於投到工業的上面去呢，那是高利貸者夢都沒有做着呢。</p>
<p>娛樂荒唐捐稅重</p>
<p>幾個從前的舞廰，後來改爲游藝塲的性質，但生意雖好而利益還是不見得好，於是又想恢復跳舞。最近聽說要有茶舞募捐，恐怕這樣的「努力」下去，舞總有恢復的一天。在舞沒有恢復前，他們所舉辦的游藝，有戰前梅花歌舞圑型的大腿跳舞，有唱桃花江舞伴之歌的曲子，有低級趣味的滑稽，有文明戲式的誰勝，像這一種游藝，茶要賣兩千元一杯一瓶不十分高明牌子的汽水，要賣二千二百一瓶。像金國那樣，天天客滿。還有電影院，有許多片子都是比較陳舊的，有一家專門映中國片子的影院，還在映「三笑」等片子呢。但是天天影院裏滿座，一家「大世界，」裏邊包羅着各種不同門類的游藝，上個月因爲電影塲裏的影片燒了，驚壞了觀衆，紛紛逃避，扶梯塌了，傷了好多人，經過一個時期停業，現在又恢復營業了，生意還是很好。不過據許多游藝塲裏的人說，雖然生意好，捐稅重，成本高，也沒有多大好處。無論如何，像杭州這樣幽美的勝地，從另方面看去，「娛樂荒」確是一個値得考慮的問題。</p>
<p>蔬菜高抬了身價</p>
<p>秋雖凉了，物價還是一樣地沒有冷落下去。猪肉已經賣兩千元一斤了，鷄蛋賣一百五十元一個，小菜二百五十元一斤，荳芽亦要二百五十元一斤，白菓都一百元才只十五顆。有一天，警察局爲整頓市容，把攤販驅走，許多賣小菜的人都揹挑着逃了。結果，那一天有好多人家買不到肉，也買不到小菜。杭州蔬菜貴，這個理由頗費腦筋，因爲杭州附近儘多菜圃，也多農塲。有人說人工貴了，但人工爲什麼貴呢？上米已經降到四萬元一担，便宜布也有得買的，鄕下的住屋沒有貴賓佔住，自然不大會引起屋荒。有人說，蔬菜跟着金子貴了，難道我們的蔬菜和金子比較起來了嗎？我的看法，蔬菜貴，是由於中間人的剝削，許多販賣蔬菜的人，他們故意抬高了蔬菜的身價</p>
<p>秋天裏，杭州市的市參議會，因着議長爲漢奸說話，鬧了一塲風波，結果舊議長辭職，選出了新議長。浙省的參議會，側重於田賦减低科則，一共足足開了二十天。淸查團來過了，沒有查出大案子來。</p>
<p>李濟琛，邵力子，兪飛鵬，謝冠生，都先後在秋天裏到杭州來。是的秋是深了，遊杭州，看看西子的秋裝，正是這個時候！</p>
<h3>秋風馬蹄　話香港</h3>
<p>— 九月廿九日香港航訊　本報特約記者凌芳</p>
<p>前兩天，本港的天文台掛起了今年第五次的颶風訊號，颶風最後沒有吹來，但已把酷暑的氣候趕跑了。戲院裏雖然還掛起開放冷氣的招牌，但票房外等候入塲的觀衆，已有人穿起淡灰色或咖啡色的呢衣了。夏季時間雖還未更改，但晨光中已使人感覺一種寒意，露台上的黃菊訴說着：秋已來了。</p>
<p>羅致名馬　大賣馬票</p>
<p>人事界似也跟着自然界在轉變中。報上大字標題連接着刋出兩個重大的消息：從十月份起，渡海的天星小輪减費了。十元一張的月票，减爲六元一張，(戰前是三元一張。）香港方面的電費也减了，由戰前收費加百分的二百六十，减爲加百分之二百，用實際的數字來說，即每度電費由五角八分减爲四角八分。人們在生活的重擔下呼出一口氣，但他們共同的興趣，却似集中到另外一個目標：秋季馬票又快開彩了！</p>
<p>澳洲馬一批一批的由洋船運進來，蹄聲早已響激快活谷。這裏沒有「馬禁」的問題，在陸軍部救濟會的金字招脾下，馬會的董事們殫精竭力去採辦名馬，富豪「大班」，四出禮聘騎士，誰人不想發財，於是大賣馬票。不比春季大香檳，首彩可獲廿五萬元，這回規模較少，最多不過三幾萬元，但三幾萬也够痛快地花一塲。求財心切的人，一連串地踏着二三十級石階，跑上交易行二樓的馬會辦事處，緊張地掬了錢，笑嘻嘻地換了馬票。廿九日那天下午，香港將多添一個小富翁！「春風得意馬蹄疾」，秋風又何嘗不如是哩！</p>
<p>九月寒衣　無力剪裁</p>
<p>人們談話，說不上三句，就說到「九月寒衣」的話題。看得　樣子的舊西裝，每套索價一百二十元以上，但這一百二十元，僅够三等洋服店一套西裝的縫工。較好的縫工，每套一百八十元以上。澳洲絨料每套一百五十元至二百元，英國的至少增加一倍以上，一套西裝的縫工幾等於工人一月的薪水。大家祗有一條心：索性穿去年的破衣吧！</p>
<p>港府幷非有意和僑胞開玩笑，可是正在他們大部分無力購置新裝的時候，却宜佈了領帶的限價：每條八元，把花花綠綠的美國領帶貶値一半以上。爲什麽绒料和縫工不宣佈限價呢？個把月前，港府宣佈疋頭統制，從進口商手裏取得了械料和棉布二萬疋，當日曾宣佈將以公價配給市民，那些絨料和棉布，現在還放在政府的倉庫裏吧。在金鎊集團的利益下，聽說澳洲和英國的絨斜，現在還得自由地由商人採購來港推銷，所稱統制的，實際上祗是美國的絨料吧。</p>
<p>物價指數　繼長增高</p>
<p>本港海關出入口署今天發表了近年來的批發物價指數。說明當前的批發。物價指數，已比戰前平均高出八倍，該統計假定一九三八年的指數爲二百，比諸本年上半年，則糧食類平均高七六八·六，五金和鑛產高三〇八·二，紡織　高八一八·八，其他雜類高七一八·九。市面零售的物價指數，當較此更高。試就糧價一項說說：糧價隨中秋的來臨，曾一度趨漲，但中秋過後，除鷄鴨牲口的價錢外，幷不見回降多少。據官方九月廿二日的統計：</p>
<p>（一）牛肉二元八(以斤計），（二）猪肉三元八，（三）臘魚三元二，（四）龍蝦四元，（五）馬鈴薯七角，（六）鷄蛋三角半，（七）花生油二元四，（八）上白米一元三，（九）白菜一元。</p>
<p>官方估計工人每週的伙食費，已達十四元，即每餐一元，折合國幣約爲七百五十元——不會比滬上一個客飯的價錢更貴吧。</p>
<p>記者不敢武斷的說，香港的生活程度可比上海尤高，但至少也不會較低吧？粵人性好吃，上茶館吃點心每天多則兩三回，少則一圑，最近本港酒樓茶室的營業收入，據非正式的估計，己比兩月前减少一半。據某大茶室的老板吿記者，由於近來各行生意的冷淡和生活程度的高漲，社會大多數人的消費力頓見减縮，過去三四人上茶館，結賬起碼十元八塊，現在减至五六元，茶客的數目雖未見减少，但茶樓的收入却大不如前了！</p>
<p>貪污成風　行動公開</p>
<p>前雨天，港中僑報都以最顯著的地位，刋出一個消息：</p>
<p>「英廷注意本港吏治</p>
<p>派員調查機關行政</p>
<p>早在上另廿六日(剛剛消息浪露前一個月，）英殖民地部已委派的兩個中西官員，開始調查本港海關出入口署，把署中有關文件都移到警察總部去審核。這是一個破壞港府統制條約類似「走私」的案件。「牽連有關的商號，凡二百餘家，主事者曾派員前往將有關的中西商號搜查，對於貨物出口證及有關文件，亦檢回警署審核。」這是「百年來所僅見」的案件，「英殖民地部派員調查，亦開香港有史以來之紀錄。」已逍搜查的商號，以運輸公司，船務公司佔最多數，聽說被牽連的人，包括有若干有關機關的高級官員。港府因爲尙未調查完畢，無意立刻公開發表案情的經過，但有關方面却一時失慎，把它洩漏了。港府發言人亦不加否認，却稱「如此傳說爲事實，則爲一『極好新聞』。」</p>
<p>工商晚報的短評說：一香港貪汚風氣，總不算弱於國內，然因其有種種法律的遮掩，與其辦事秩序之較有條理，所以雖有錯誤，亦容易逃避人之耳目……。」在戰後「混水摸魚」的局面下，香港的貪汚風氣更爲猖獗，竟至「遮掩」無可遮掩，「逃避」無可逃避，面列入調查名單內的港府所囑機關，也許不祗海關出入口署而已！工商晚報又說：「香港未陷敵手時「指日敵」，吏治的腐敗，是有口皆碑的。警察探員，隨處受賄，包娼庇賭，無所不爲，甚至街頭小販，一元半角，皆爲搜括，其他各機關，如居民有所請求，大都因人事與苞　而定其可行與否及遲速先後。最顯著的，當戰爭將臨時，其移民證問題與出入口貨發證事件，皆爲當日香港居民所痛心疾首的。……」</p>
<p>就是英人自辨的德臣西報也說：「本港公務人員及官署，不時有舞弊情事發生，　在一九四一年前，亦曾有發現。自勝利後，貪汚規模之廣大，無弊者之大膽，而居然公開行動，亦爲戰前所不能想像者……」</p>
<p>茲當戰後，與民更始，香港的吏治實有澈底整飭的必要。</p>
<h3>秋之颱風</h3>
<p>— 九月廿八日高雄航訊　本報特派員江暮雲</p>
<p>台灣之秋，被它的特產颱風掃盪過後，給予台省人以三十五年來未有的災難。慣於迎受颱風的本省人，也沒法戰勝自然向人類的挑戰而克服了。記者適在合省中南部行旅中，目擊身受颱風所給予以災厄，實足以說明人類還沒有控制自然和天時變幻的力量。對於受災的人們，記者們又掬起了同情淚，爲自然的暴戾而悲歎！</p>
<p>台南平原　災况滿目</p>
<p>記渚在嘉義旅社像是拘留了一夜，沒有燈，沒有火，有的是風聲，雨點，這是來合半年來第一次！到廿五日記者們冒着颱風尾，搭着大卡車作台南行。</p>
<p>作爲中央幹綫的交通高雄錢，因爲番子田到善化一段中的掙樑發生了故障，使我們只有搭貨車沿公路南行。我們擠在裝滿上海布疋的卡車上，不出市十五分鐘，便領受着大雨，車頂沒有油布，簇聚一起的二十多人，都成了落湯鷄，雨仍是像永塊，風把同行者的草帽都吹飄去了，氣溫顯然低落，頗有寒意。</p>
<p>公路有幾段完全給水淹沒了，有幾處，水泥的橋樑邊，缺了個大口，遠近，淤塞在泥沙裏的蕃薯嫩芽，已呈現萎焦，苧蔴的梗子赤着膊和甘蔗一樣裸着身，向同一方向彎着腰；甘蔴，稻作，薯田，農人的血汗，都無代價地償給了自然的風暴！記者想起了本年作物，尤其是十二月收成的甘蔗，糖業增產顯然受了打雖！公路旁的芒菓樹倒了，車子走了不久，車夫總得下車開路；原野裏，有幾個披養戴笠的牧童和肩着鋤的農夫，以及爲網着魚而歡欣的人們，在點綴着災區的小景，記者並不留戀這兩中賽江南的景　，而在被坍倒了的農家，工塲房屋的人們，怎樣應付着這老天帶來的不幸日子？這却引起了記者的共鳴。</p>
<p>風勢稍衰了，迎面吹來的風，在寒冷中又有點熱意，記者已體味到了熱帶的台省南部。郵政局綠色的車子載着工友們在修理電桿折斷了的綫路，電力公司也駛着黃色的卡車，沿路在找尋它的破壞的所在，風災給人們只有事後的儘速恢復，儘速維持原狀！</p>
<p>往時一小時許的車程，經過了四小時半，記者到了渴望已久的台南古城。市區的破舊和遺留着戰時的災痕，到處都是，沒有電，電燈，電話，沒有水，甚至洗衣洗手的水都成了問題，黑暗的寂寥的台南，使人更感到這裏是名符其實的死市，死城！</p>

<h3>秋在蘭州</h3>
<p>— 本報特約記者冰子　九月十日寄自蘭州</p>
<p>秋凉了，黃土高原的西北，分外凉得早些，蘭州自然不會例外。每遇刮風天，土沙撲面，令人感覺到一切荒凉。</p>
<p>西寗傳來的消息，正在興修中的靑新公路，近來因爲沿綫氣候暴變，而且有成還陣的蚊蚋，以致担任運輸的牲畜，死亡甚鉅現在已影響到工程的進展。</p>
<p>秋凉以來，此間不斷傳來一些令人內心發熱的謠言。蘭州一向謠言最多，可是這次的謠言，已漸接近事實了。共軍李先念部竄在陝南後，即有入甘通過西蘭公路衝到陝北的企圖，現在甘省華亭和微縣境內，都先後發現了搶刦老百姓的人羣，每股據說不過三四百人，究竟是共軍，還是土匪，尙未判明，聽說這些搶人的人羣，老百姓已經滿懷痛恨。</p>
<p>各地黃金價繼續下跌，獨蘭州高高居上，條錠每兩盤旋於廿四五萬之間，這與所傳的謠言關係很大。</p>
<p>轟動國內外之「武都原人」，爲甘省科學工作者一大發現，亦可能成爲世界一大發現。前次發現的類似人類頭蓋骨一具，尙在精密研究中。甘科學敎育館硏究員王永焱君，即將再赴武都繼續發掘。</p>
<p>隴海路徐州開對間被共軍破壞後，京滬至蘭之有綫電報，亦已不通。由蘭發往京滬之電報，係走無綫電，而無綫電通報時間有限，自滬發蘭之電報，有遲至兩週始可收到者。蘭市各種物價，也因去上海之路不通，起了甚大的波動。</p>

<h3>復興法蘭西</h3>
<p>— 施蟄存</p>
<p>一段譯文及一個跋語</p>
<p>文人的工作從來沒有比這時候更偉大的了</p>
<p>在我們所處的這個時候，我們祇有一件事該做；一件唯一的事。是什麼呢？</p>
<p>復興法蘭西。</p>
<p>復興法蘭西。爲了誰？爲了法蘭西嗎？不是。爲了全世界人們決不是爲了火炬而重新燃旺那火炬的。</p>
<p>人們重新燃旺那火炬，是爲了那些在黑夜中的人，爲了那些在窟室中伸手摸索着那致命的阻礙的牆壁的人；爲了那些缺乏着指導，光明，溫情，勇氣，正道，目標的人；爲了那些有一個陰影在他們的前途，在他們的工作中，在他們的良知裏的人；爲了那些在他們底戰鬥或勝利中需要一個清楚的視野的人。人們重新燃旺一個火炬，也就是爲了那曾經熄滅掉這個火炬而感到蒙昧的人。</p>
<p>但是，爲了重燃那火炬，爲了復興法蘭西，該用什麻方法呢？該怎麼做呢？</p>
<p>這誠然是很艱難的，但是也很簡單：我們應該使他放射出火光來。</p>
<p>從什麼地方放射出來呢？</p>
<p>從人民底靈魂裏。</p>
<p>路易·阿拉貢與保羅·艾呂亞是兩個法國詩人，戰前都是屬於超現實派的。巴黎陷落之後，他們都從事地下工作，不單在文藝方面盡了抗戰任務，甚至在組織羣衆，訓練地下軍這方面，他們也成爲不可缺少的份子。這在中國文學界看起來，也許有點想像不到。因爲中國文學者向來把超現實派看作是一個消極的，麻醉的，幻想的文藝運動，而不知其出發點原在於反抗傳統，反抗約束，從此而得到反抗法西斯蒂的結果。</p>
<p>昨天一個在法國的朋友給我寄了一本詩與散文的雜誌來。誌名「永生評論」。是艾呂亞在抗戰時期秘密刋行，而現在繼續由路易·巴洛主編出版的一個精美的雜誌。這一小本雜誌使我們感覺到法國文壇已在進行極健全的復員工作，回看我們自己的文藝出版界，真有點窒息。</p>
<p>這個新四號的「永生評論」却以法國大文豪雨果在一八七五年寫的一篇短文載在卷首。這篇短文極有意思，可以看作是法國文藝工作者在勝利之後重整旗鼓的宣言。我很高興把牠迻譯如上，並且，讓我們把「法蘭西」這幾個字改爲「中華民國」好不好？</p>
<h3>觀歷代書畫展所感</h3>
<p>— 潘泊鷹</p>
<p>中國文物公司最近在上海舉辦歷代書畫展。這使人真有「空谷足音」的欣喜！前後兩次，我皆以鼓舞的心情去參觀過。關於藝術上的賞鑒，如若說起，要說的話太多，不是匆匆所能寫出。當俟一二日內，心情稍定，再另外專就此點貢獻一些淺見就正大雅。</p>
<p>我覺得文物公司已經作了一件可珍貴的起始工作。對於社會觀感，引起注意，這是最大的價值和收穫。在兵連禍結之今日，這種努力，豈特不是「玩物喪志」，抑且不是「抱殘守缺」，而是含有「旁搜墜緒」「張皇幽眇」的承啓精神的。</p>
<p>當國是不定，社會困窮之時，一班人總以爲文化事業是賠錢之事，是不急之務，無人肯用心去作。誠然，文化事業就其全部言，是賠錢的，而且必須賠錢。但以書畫一小部份言，却不定是賠錢的事，甚至可以賠錢。如若經營得法，並且是一宗很穩定有利的生意。所以作這一工作的人，不要怕賠錢而不能支持。只要當一件事業努力去作，一定可以賺錢的。這些話說起來，好像不風雅；但要切實作去，還須從此下手。不過，「下手」並非「着眼」。我們着眼仍在文化的效果上。賺一些錢，爲的是維持和發展這事業；與商人的「惟利是圖」有根本的區別。必須這樣纔可以不憂事之不能辦，而可達到文化效果的目的。</p>
<p>這件事本來應由政府來辦。政府旣不暇及此，無錢的人又無力辦，有錢的人又不屑辦。所以我們對於文物公司格外欣喜格外盼望。在這一觀點上，願致其希望數事如下。</p>
<p>第一，希望這種展覽會，可以繼續多多辦理。這一次在秋高氣爽之時展出，已有很好成績，以後春秋佳日，良辰令節，可以多分幾個地方同時舉行。</p>
<p>第二，希望文物公司更發揮其虛心和負責的精神，與各收藏家取得更密切的合作。信用是作出來的，這一次許多收藏家未將精品拿出，就初期辦此事而言。這是不足怪的。我們要說，有這樣成績已經大大不易。收藏家對於其所　愛的書畫，不肯輕芭示人，也自有其許多充足的理由。他　　　成績可以努力克服這些困難。以後收藏家更有保障，樂於送出，則必更見精采。</p>
<p>第三，希望不僅以展覽爲已足，而更進一步作攝影和印刷的工作，使名蹟得以流傳。並得以廉價的流傳。（廉價和賺錢，不但並行不悖，而且相得益彰。）</p>
<p>第四，希望更多多作解釋和啓迪的工作，引起社會普遍的愛好興趣。僅僅一張畫懸在壁上，只有高明的賞鑑家愛好。但如將這張畫的作者，時代，和其所以好的道理，加以詳細，扼要，淺近的解釋之後，普通人也愛好了。這樣的啓迪工作非常必要。這種工作如若成功，則文化目的和賠錢目的可以一箭雙雕地達到。</p>
<p>粗疏地只有隨感所及寫下這幾點。因之又想起在這次大戰中，英國人喊出的口號。當英國被德國的閃電戰打得頭昏脚軟之時，英國人喊出「我們學敵人」的口號。其實呢，世間一切「無常師」。「三人行必有我師焉」。這呌作「善善從長」。關於中國書畫的複製和宣揚，我們不能抹殺日本人的努力。他們的工作中，有許多可笑的，但其可笑處，皆足以顯示其努力。這值得我們警惕，值得我們奮起。我們應該從現在起作得比他們更好些！</p>
<h3>慈悲的劊子手</h3>
<p>— ·錢蕃甫·</p>
<p>跨登幾級樓梯，已經聽見樓上一陣喧笑，走到二樓客堂，果然看見錦秋和她的弟妹，在爭奪一包花生米，玩鬧着，錦秋身旁，坐着一位衰老的婦人，而容瘦削，默默的。</p>
<p>錦秋劈頭，就問我爲甚麼來得這樣遲，我隨意推說候車的人多，許久才擠上電車。接着，我用手勢問她身邊的老婦是誰。錦秋笑了。我以爲她實在沒有笑的理由，不料錦秋却站起來說：</p>
<p>你來得巧極了！這位是黃太太，這位是錢先生，黃太太正想找人替她寫一封信，那末，就麻煩你代勞吧。」</p>
<p>靜秋——錦秋的妹妹——早已把信紙筆墨放到桌上，我祇好走過去和那位老太太含笑招呼。她要寫的，是給她兒子的信。根據她的言語，我筆錄成以下一封簡短的書柬：</p>
<p>「展鵬吾兒入目：汝來信日疏，深以爲念，母已屆風燭之年，體力日衰，寄食汝妹婿家中，終非久計。吾兒在外，所謀順遂否？今後究擬來滬團聚，抑或另有主張，務即切實復我爲要！母白。」</p>
<p>寫完，我對黃太太讀了一遍，她滿意地點了點頭。我替她把信封好，忽然發現錦秋遠遠向我扮了一個鬼臉，直抿着嘴笑。我覺得她今天的舉動，有點失常。</p>
<p>黃老太太告辭之前，沒有忘記向我道謝。目送她那瘦削的背影，踽踽的脚步，不禁使我對這一個身世飄零的老人。引起了無限同情。</p>
<p>老太太一走，我們幾個年青的大孩子。恰似去了一層束縛。我開口質問錦秋：「你剛才——？」</p>
<p>「你自己做了傻子還不知道。」</p>
<p>我不覺詫異起來：</p>
<p>「你從什麼地方看得出我是傻子？」</p>
<p>「因爲，你剛才寫信給一個已經死了的人。」</p>
<p>「呀！」我驚愕了半响，方才吐出聲音：「死了的人？」</p>
<p>錦秋倒了一杯茶給我，我一邊喝，一邊凝神聽她說明。</p>
<p>原來黃太太的家境，本來很富裕。丈夫死後，景况漸不如從前，等到展鵬中學畢業以後，已經無力升學，便考入一所銀行充當練習生，藉以自立養家，他自幼嬌生慣養，受不得氣，和同事常有爭吵。別人懷恨在心，暗中設計陷害他，一天值他派出去收賬，便故意將數字改易。黃展鵬收賬歸來，呈繳騐收，發覺短少了一百元。那時候是二十六年秋天，一百塊錢可以買十石米！展鵬無辜受累，有口難辯，又無力賠償。青年人受不了屈曲，又怕回家見不得老母，一個人，如醉如痴的，走上大百貨公司的屋頂遊藝塲，縱身躍下，當塲腦漿迸裂。但是在他死後三小時，銀行已經查明他並沒有作弊，可是遲了。</p>
<p>說到這裏，錦秋歏了一口氣，接着又告訴我：「他妹子得到凶耗，夫妻倆商量了一下，認爲黃老太太體質素弱，禁不住刺?，便瞞着她，謊說是展鵬到外埠收賬去了。恰巧戰事發生，交通阻滯，訊息不通，直到今日，那一個身故已經九年的兒子，還活在他老母的心中。」</p>
<p>錦秋把話說完，室中留下一片沉寂。</p>
<p>我思量了好一會，然後對錦秋說道：「我以爲因了避免一時痛楚，反而使這位老婦人感受無限長期的痛苦——空留一縷未絕的希望，永遠潛伏在她的生命中作祟，無論如何，是一件殘忍的事</p>
<p>「依你該怎麼樣辦呢？」</p>
<p>「把全部真相告訴她，讓她用一日的悲傷抵銷十年的痛苦。」</p>
<p>可是我和錦秋一同到展鵬妹妹家裏，把意見向她提出時，她婉言謝絕。我到底沒有做這一個「慈悲的劊子手」。</p>

<p>在林中，我們走着……</p>
<p>沿着山坡的斜路，樹林密密地呈着它們各自有的姿態，做成了遮蔽天空的綠色的霧帳。</p>
<p>我們漫步地踏着樹蔭，徱直的樹幹直立着，塔尖一樣的指向蔚藍色的天空。向下紛披的葉叢，覆蓋着，像一層層屋頂，從稠陰裏面陽光在綠茵的草地上撒下了花格似的陰影。……</p>
<p>「我憧憬着一個廣闊深沉的樹林哩！」</p>
<p>每天，我都要來到這林中，讓我的肺葉在清新的凉意裏舒展起來！而樹林綠色的液波，總是這麼接連地，接連地汹湧着。……</p>
<p>於是，我們挽着手，在林中紆緩地走着，走着……</p>

<p>秋天，駐脚在江南的草原上。</p>
<p>在寬廣的草原懷抱裏，我摘下了一朶紫色的，含蓄了生命力的花，</p>

<p>妳別担心呀！我不會把我難言的痛苦，無限的相思，以及妳所給予了我的草原底夢吹向妳生命的深處。</p>
<p>「讓草原的追逐着，馳過這綠色的茵海吧！」</p>
<p>於是，我們躺下來，讓生命的靈魂飄散在草原的夢裏……</p>
<p>蜀中印人記</p>
<h3>蕭友于</h3>
<p>— ·高甜心·</p>
<p>抗戰前，川中將領王治易將軍，曾以飛機去北平，接齊山人白石進川，寓其府第，一時蜀都石貴，傳爲美談。一日，有一士兵詣王府第，聲稱欲謁見齊老先生，守衛輕其乃一士兵，戲進稟之。山人大奇，道請。此一士兵見面竟無一語，雙膝下跪。山人問其來由，答特來學刻印也。齊老先生，爲此一士兵真誠感動，慨然允之。此一士兵爲誰？則蕭友于先生也。至今蕭先生寓居四川叙府城內，求刻甚衆，以余所見，學齊老頭子的單刀白文，如蕭先生者，實不多見。因其真正一刀刻成，並非單刀雙做也。在此附贅一言，聞王治易先生曾因齊先生所刻多不合六書，刻印皆已磨去未知確否？</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血　53</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>我看見那位青年領隊，一躍下車，一手抓住手槍，一手打着手式，臉却向山側邊向着。真正不到一秒時間，前後三部車的人都下了車，各自警戒，跑到領隊那裏去，成了一種不規則的小散兵綫，連領隊連司機共是九人，三管手提機關，其餘都有一支手槍或盒子砲。我見這裏離電台不過一里來路，打算不坐車了，便半商量半通知的對鼎元說，「我也得下去看看，大哥，您就在車裏等一等」。又對司機及兩位同志說，「您有傢伙請分一把給我，這位吳工程師是馮師長部下的技師，病剛好，就待在車裏，請分一點神……」他們立刻給了我一把德式十二響，連子彈匣也解下了遞過來。</p>
<p>這時前面九個人，已取搜索的姿態，向土山包圍上去，我緊好了子彈匣，把手槍檢視了一下，開了保險，也追上前去。我們搜索到土山頂上，一直不見人影，也不聽見槍聲，我覺得有些奇怪。這裏的形勢，朝東是綿連不斷的山埂，朝南只隔着一個谷，正是公路的入口，跨過去又是土山埂，一起一伏，拖沿下去；東邊就是盆地裏的鎮市，再過去就是鐵道。我們的電站和路局電廠都在對面山埂的東面坡下。我怕領隊，不熟悉這裏的地勢，便過去對他說，我們先跨到對山要緊，電台和廠，翻過那座小山就可看到。</p>
<p>領隊很同意我的話，便斜插着向山下疾走。剛到半山，便發見公路上，有三四個人，向上鎮的方向直跑。因爲天色已經黃昏，看不清是那一方的人，只知道沒穿軍裝，可是他們手上都有傢伙。領隊一見，便打了手式，加緊脚步，衝到山脚，跨過了公路，又上了對面的山坡。因爲那公路是沿山脚向南轉彎的，所以他也不問有路沒路，只取三角形的直弦，斜插着跑去，這樣就可把那幾個傢伙，兜截個正着。我們這　跑着，沒防到那幾個傢伙，不知怎的，也捨了公路，向山上斜插着上來，大槪沒有注意到我們正是衝着他們前進的。</p>
<p>「站住，喂！」領隊在距離他們不到百碼的地點，大聲喝着，又向空放了兩槍。這在懂得軍事的人看，他們已經完全被我們罩住了；因爲我們的地位高，地形利，又是下山坡，人數比他們多，好比空戰，我們已經控制了他們的死角；照理，他們就應該放下武器，或是立即找地形背城借一祇要有援可增；再不然就是拼死。誰知這幾個傢伙，並無軍事知識，兩條大路都不肯走；一聽見槍聲，驚得回頭看了一看，仍舊沒命向前跑着。</p>
<p>砰！……前面頭一個倒下去了。這是我們的領隊給他們一個警告，因他仍想叫他們站住，問個明白：也許是自己一方面的人，也許是地方上的自衛團。要是敵人的話，也可活提起來，問問情形。</p>
<p>誰知那其餘的三個，祇把手上的傢伙拋了，仍舊捨命照着路綫跑。我們的領隊，看見這種情形，倒楞住了，一面追着，一面側回頭來問我，「這是怎麼一回事？」換句話，這就是說那般傢伙怎麼全是外行呢？</p>

<h3>羣聲</h3>
<p>— 少夫</p>
<p>羣聲籃球隊來滬後，八戰八勝，聲勢雄壯，使上海體育界震驚，使萬千球迷過足了球　。</p>
<p>時代是無情的，尤以體育界爲最殘酷。老實說，老資格是不能在球塲上賣的。倘使十年前他是明星，十年後他還在活躍，那祗是證明後人的不長進，因爲球塲上的皇冠爲一個人也祗能保持十年。</p>
<p>何以故？曰：技術之外，精力充沛是最基本的條件。今日，我們如果還讓一個四十歲以上的人氣咻咻地在塲上奔馳，似乎是恥辱。</p>
<p>很多朋友說，一般靠球爲生的人，幾乎成爲欲罷不能之勢，有包圍他的人，有自己骸骨迷戀的心情，於是，在矛盾狀態不得不川塲丟醜了，天下最悲哀的事還有過於此嗎？</p>
<p>羣聲來滬所表演的，我認爲並不是他們八戰八勝的戰果，而是帶給我們一個真理：你要進步，把握時代，和生活的嚴肅。</p>
<p>其實，不僅一個球隊如此，凡百事來，能不受這三個因索拘束嗎？</p>
<h3>錦彇河山，不能一失再失！請注意南海諸島嶼</h3>
<p>— 一</p>
<p>據九月廿八日申報載：行政院令粤省府接收南海請島嶼，所謂南海諸島嶼，包括東沙島西沙羣島，南沙羣島及團沙羣島，均分佈於極南的南海中。其中的一段歷史和情景，頗値得一談：此等島嶼，好似許多的珍珠散佈於南中國的海中，而放着她的光耀映照於南國的氣候裏，四季皆夏，炎熱異常，最低的路易薩礁，緯度低得在六度左右，接近英屬婆羅洲附近。因地處遙遠，故一般人均對她沒有印象。</p>
<p>羣島風光</p>
<p>各羣島中，以東沙島離廣東省最近，西沙羣島則離海南島較近。東沙島爲沙淤積而成，粵籍漁民，常往捕魚，島上設有燈塔及氣象台，並富產樹木，藥材及磷礦。西沙羣島由大小十餘島嶼組成，以前歸海南崖縣管轄，海南漁人來此捕魚者極多，因羣島淺海間，富海產，如鮑魚，海參，紫草，海帶，玳琄等。而磷礦尤富，每當夜晚，羣星棋佈·海上磷光四射，相映成趣。南沙羣島則均係珊瑚淺礁構成，均較荒凉、然亦富漁鹽之利。</p>
<p>日本侵</p>
<p>關於圑沙羣島，所要說者較多：團沙羣島在西沙羣島東南。因均係一圑圑沙積起而成，故名。分佈範圍甚廣，離海南島亦有二百餘里，然歷來皆爲　崖漁人捕魚之處，且歷史甚久。其中有許多爲危險區域，且爲航海要衝，故常有觸礁之虞。民國十七年，廣東省府，曾派人測量，大有開發之意。後來至國廿二年；法國竟以艦隊强占西部九小島、至大戰爆發，日人即加以侵占，謂係共本國人所發見，並更名曰新南羣島，屬於台灣總督府高雄州管轄，一時地利大興，並於西沙島築氣象台等，於島上更加以移民，大有永遠侵占之意。島上　礦並經開採，至今殆無多少矣！勝利後，台省公署照例派員前往接收，並樹以合灣省行政長官公署接收完了字樣，除此而外，均無人烟，接收人員至此，大有海闊天空，地廣人稀之感。</p>
<p>有人垂涎</p>
<p>今年，菲律濱共和國新獨立，見我國對團沙羣島毫不顧慮，大有侵占之意，將其劃入彼等國防範園之內，此等事實，實爲荒謬，想新獨立的菲律濱共和國，已有領土野心。可嘆之至！一面反觀我國，大好山河，不去顧及；今聞政院命令粤省府派員前去接收，至爲快慰！祝其成功！此等羣島本屬海南島歸粤省管轄的，將來海南島如建立行省，當歸海南管轄，爲一定的道理。</p>
<p>最後，南海諸羣島在戰前，名義上屬於我國，其實富源如磷礦等，均被日人偸運，而我們一些不知道。現在，應不能再讓此富源白白送於他人之手，要知南海諸島盛產各物以外，對於疆域領土國防大有關係，將來我國　海軍發展，以此闢作軍港，不但能保衛祖國，且能控制南海，故其重要性，不惟產業　富一項而已！</p>
<p>我們不能不顧南海諸羣島，更不能放棄她們，錦繡河山，不能一失再失！</p>

<h3>太陽黑點</h3>
<p>— 鶴</p>
<p>據九月廿四日申報載的一段脫漏電訊中，括弧說明當時因太陽黑點的關係，全球的無綫電交通被阻礙，以致斷絕一節·按太陽黑點又名太陽黑子，在太陽中存在極多，爲呈灰黑色的小點。所謂小點，其實比我們的地球還大，有的且能有地球三四十倍的大小，不過其在太陽中尙算很小而已。</p>
<p>太陽黑點呈旋轉形其中心有一核，四周有金屬熱氣旋轉而出，眞似一個極大的旋風。</p>
<p>太陽黑點爲什麼比太陽的其餘部分略暗呢！這是一個頗難解答的問題，有的科學家則謂係四周射出的氣體逐漸冷却的緣故，但也不十分可靠；總之，它的一切，尙有許多的謎，留待將來解決。太陽黑點的直徑有達四五萬哩之巨大的，不過普通的均約一二萬哩。</p>
<p>任何人都知道地球是有磁力的，否則指南針爲什麽永久指向南呢？但是太陽也有磁力，而且是常常變更的，太陽時常發生磁暴，尤其在太陽黑點的區域內。天文學家測定，有時這種磁力的暴風(所謂磁暴）能大於地球的磁力一萬多倍；但時至今日，尙不知道這種的磁暴究竟是發生於太陽的表面抑或發生於太陽的內部？不過太陽黑點範圍之內，是有帶電物質的激烈旋動，以至發生時常變更的磁暴的，似發電機然。</p>
<p>太陽黑點是能產生磁力的，所以在黑點範圍之內，其磁的吸引力之大可以想像而知。如果放以刀·針·鋸·鎚等鐵器臨近太陽黑點，是任你用多大的力所分不開來的。但實際上不管你分得開分不開，早已經其熱度而融成白熱了，雖然太陽黑點的熱度比其他各部稍低。</p>
<p>在臨近北極的地方，時常能見到有光亮的帶狀的光自天邊而出，映在黑暗的長夜裏，蔚爲奇觀。這呌做北極光，又名極曉。北極光發生的時候，太陽黑點的磁暴及指南針均跟着北極光的大小而變更，可知三者之間必有密切的關係，而尤其是北極光發現的時候，太陽黑點甚爲騷動。</p>
<p>太陽黑點的磁暴能阻礙我們地球上的無綫電交通，而尤當其激動的時候爲最；而太陽　點的激動時間無定，且距地球遠，所以地球上還不致受累深重；假使地球的衛星月亮上也有如太陽上一樣的磁暴的發生，則月球距地球較近在地球上產生一陣陣的磁暴，可能阻礙全地球的然綫電交通不能通訊；幸而月亮沒有磁性，也不會發生磁暴，而太陽呢？也不是常有强大的磁暴達地面足以阻礙無綫電交通的，所以無綫電交通受太陽黑點的阻礙是不甚常見的。</p>

<h3>The Peace Talk Situation Remains Dull; The Chinese Communists Have Not Yet Formally Replied; The US Embassy Denies Soviet Involvement in Mediation</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 4th] Regarding the rumors that the Soviet Ambassador recently sent a letter to Ambassador Stuart regarding the Chinese situation, the US Embassy spokesman, Conner, solemnly stated on the afternoon of the 4th that it was absolutely untrue, and that Ambassador Stuart had never received a letter from the Soviet Ambassador, nor had Special Envoy Marshall had any correspondence with him. The rumor that the Soviet Ambassador would participate in mediation is purely a rumor.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 4th] The situation remains stagnant today. The representatives of the government in the Political Consultative Conference sent a reply to Zhou Enlai and others of the Chinese Communist Party, which has been sent to Shanghai by a special messenger. Although the letter explained the government's response to the memorandum submitted by Zhou Enlai and others, it was delivered by Marshall and Mr. Secretary. This morning, when Dong Biwu and Wang Bingnan visited Marshcall and Mr. Secretary, they still inquired whether the government had responded to the CCP's memorandum, and asked whether the government's statement issued the previous day was the response. The meeting between Dong, Wang, Marshall and Secretary lasted a long time. In addition to inquiries, the Zhangjiakou ceasefire was still the theme of the conversation. It is reported that the two officials did not give a formal reply, and it is also reported that Marshall and Secretary are still willing to make a final effort to mediate, hoping that peace can be achieved soon. At 10:30 on the morning of the 4th, Pi Zonggan, Military Attache of the National Government, visited Ambassador Stuart, and then met with Special Envoy Marshall. In addition to receiving a certain person from the Executive Headquarters, Ambassador Stuart also hosted a banquet for church people in the evening, with no other activities. At present, what all parties are expecting is the Communist Party's final attitude. Chuan Jingbo, Ambassador Stuart's personal advisor, visited President Song at 5:00 p.m. According to reports, he indicated that the situation is expected to turn around in two or three days.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 4th] Xinhua News Agency's draft on the 4th reported from Yan'an on the 3rd, with the title "Chinese Communist Party Officials Claim that the Three-Man Conference Should Be Restored, the Ceasefire Order of January Has No Guarantee of Peace, and the Chinese Communist Party is Not Considering Participating in the Government and the National Assembly." The content is an informal response to the government's statement on the situation announced on the 2nd in a question-and-answer tone, summarized as follows: (1) It is said that the government still shows no signs of being prepared to cease fire, and that attacking Zhangjiakou is a clear indication of its determination to break the peace talks. The troop reorganization plan mentioned in the government's statement has been torn up, and can now be regarded as a unilateral excuse to restrain the CCP; (2) The first task of the Three-Man Conference is to unconditionally restore the validity of the January 10th ceasefire order. If this cannot be done, the CCP will fight to the end for the ceasefire order and the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference; (3) Only after peace is guaranteed on the basis of the January 10th ceasefire order can the CCP consider its attitude towards participating in the government and the National Assembly.</p>
<p>[Local News] Chen Jiakang, spokesperson of the Chinese Communist Party, believes that the two "maximum concessions" mentioned in the government's statement on October 2 are not concessions, but another unreasonable demand to undermine the Political Consultative Conference.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Nanjing Dispatch, 4th] Chairman Chiang met with Zeng Qi, leader of the Youth Party, and Liu Dongyan, member of the Central Standing Committee of the party, at his official residence at 5:20 p.m. today. Zeng gave a detailed account of his observations during his travels in North and Northeast China. He also made some statements on how to promote democratic unity and peaceful unification. They left at 6:15 p.m.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Nanjing Dispatch, 4th] Zeng Qi, leader of the Youth Party, and Liu Dong, a member of the Central Standing Committee of the party, visited Ambassador Stuart at his official residence on the afternoon of the 3rd. Advisor Fu Jingbo was also present. Zeng first expressed his respect to the ambassador for his efforts for China's peaceful unification. The ambassador humbly said, "Laboring without success." Zeng said that the work of the ambassador and General Marshall would eventually have a great effect, because Marshall's visit to China had already promoted two things: (1) the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, and (2) the troop reorganization plan. Although there have been twists and turns due to military conflicts, these two things are indeed supported by domestic and foreign public opinion, and will eventually be realized sooner or later. There will definitely be clues within the year. This is the last five minutes, and I hope that the ambassador and General Marshall will continue to make the last effort. The Chinese Youth Party will cooperate as a third party in the country to promote its success. The ambassador was delighted by this. They left around 5 o'clock.</p>
<h3>Luo Longji and Others Host Reporters, Elaborating on the Democratic League's Position; Maintaining a Neutral Attitude Towards the Situation</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The China Democratic League held a press conference at the Hongmian Restaurant on Zhongzheng East Road at 2:00 p.m. yesterday. More than 60 reporters from various newspapers attended. Shen Junru, Luo Longji, Zhang Junmai, Huang Yanpei, and Zhang Bojun from the Democratic League were all present.</p>
<p>Luo Longji spoke first, stating that the purpose of today's reception was to express the Democratic League's attitude towards the recent development of the situation, in three points:</p>
<p>First, regarding the issue of war and peace, that is, the issue of unification or division, the Democratic League has clearly expressed its position in the telegram to Chairman Chiang regarding the National Assembly. We believe that the National Assembly on November 12 is not only the key to formulating a constitution and implementing constitutional government, but also the key to China's unification or division. We advocate ending party rule in advance and implementing constitutional government, so we will never oppose the convening of the National Assembly, and we will never refuse to participate without any reason. However, looking at the current situation, the period before November 12 is the most important key. The Democratic League is of course willing to participate in and support Mr. Chiang's leadership in anything that helps peaceful unification; if it is not conducive to peaceful unification, such as causing a long-term division or long-term civil war, the Democratic League will not only be unwilling to participate, but will also step forward in society to oppose it. We are not opposed to the National Assembly, nor are we opposed to ending party rule, but we are opposed to China still having a divided situation after eight years of war. Recently, both the Kuomintang and the Communist Party have issued documents. The government has proposed two conditions: the number of seats on the National Government Committee and the areas where troops are stationed. It is not yet known how the Chinese Communist Party will respond. Today, the Democratic League is not responding on behalf of the Chinese Communist Party, but because the issue of the number of seats involves the Democratic League and is related to the entire peaceful unification, it is specifically brought up to explain to society. The CCP requires that the National Government Committee have a total of 14 seats with the Democratic League. Some people therefore recognize the Democratic League as the tail of the CCP and have an agreement with the CCP. In fact, at the Political Consultative Conference at that time, the government's request was for a majority, and the CCP proposed a three-thirds system. Later, the government's majority of seats was passed by the Political Consultative Conference, and the CCP insisted on having a one-third veto power to protect the peaceful nation-building program. The Democratic League is unwilling to affect the unification and solidarity because of the issue of the number of seats, and feels that after 20 years of struggle between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, suspicion between each other is inevitable. In order to seek cooperation between the two parties and make the two parties feel relieved to participate in the coalition government, although it is clear that it may cause misunderstandings from the outside world, after careful consideration, it was decided to help the CCP obtain one-third of the seats. Frankly speaking, Zhou Enlai had obtained the government's understanding at the Political Consultative Conference before it was closed, and the Democratic League had also expressed to the CCP that it would definitely assist and cooperate in exercising the veto power. Unexpectedly, to this day, this issue is still a point of contention between war and peace. The opinion of the Democratic League has been expressed by Mr. Liang Shuming. We believe that it is very inappropriate for the government to drag a seat from a non-party and non-faction to the CCP, because what the CCP requires is a veto power. The Democratic League cannot bear to affect the peace of the whole country because of one or two committee seats. Regarding the issue of troop deployment, the peaceful nation-building program formulated by the Political Consultative Conference already has a solution. The first article of the military matters stipulates that the reorganization of the army must separate the party from the army and the government from the army. If it can be implemented accordingly to achieve the nationalization of the army and the army does not interfere in politics, then what troop deployment issue is there to talk about? Therefore, the Democratic League emphasizes the implementation of the peaceful nation-building program and cooperates with the troop reorganization plan to seek a solution.</p>
<p>Second, regarding the attitude of the United States, the Democratic League neither opposes the United States nor opposes the Soviet Union, neither pulls the United States to oppose the Soviet Union nor pulls the Soviet Union to oppose the United States. We are willing to be friends with the United States and the Soviet Union, and we hope that the United States and the Soviet Union will cooperate. However, an independent and autonomous country can never tolerate a second country stationing troops in its territory, so we advocate the withdrawal of US troops and oppose any country stationing troops in China. We are grateful for the help that the United States has given us in the past, but we cannot lower our national status because of this. Moreover, we advocate that "US troops" withdraw from China, not that "the United States" withdraw from China. We do not oppose economic or other assistance. However, there is one condition, that is, it cannot be involved in civil war. Otherwise, if the civil war continues to expand and prolong, the United States should be held responsible.</p>
<p>Third, the Democratic League's attitude towards the Li Wen case and the entire democracy and freedom. The government seems to have ended the Li Wen case, but the Democratic League cannot be satisfied. We will continue to urge the government to pay attention to the murderers of the Li case and cannot be ambiguous. We must remind the government to realize the four promises and the respect for people's rights in the peaceful nation-building program.</p>
<p>Zhang Junmai then stood up and spoke, emphasizing that today, everyone must be calm and unanimously demand peace.</p>
<p>Huang Yanpei finally added the opinion that we cannot fight anymore.</p>
<p>After Huang finished speaking, reporters from various newspapers raised questions one after another, and Luo Longji and Zhang Bojun answered them separately. The content is summarized as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The Democratic League believes that the key to war and peace lies not in the number of seats on the National Government Committee, but in the battles in areas such as Subei, Chengde, Longhai Line, and Zhangjiakou. Although the Democratic League helped the CCP obtain one-third of the seats, it does not mean that it will always help the CCP, but it is based on right and wrong. If the Kuomintang and the Communist Party split up, the Democratic League will take an independent attitude. Because the Democratic League has no guns or soldiers, it cannot help either side. However, the Democratic League still opposes division and opposes civil war. As long as there is a day to speak, it will do its best to call for peace.</p>
<p>(2) The Democratic League advocates the withdrawal of US troops, but the Democratic League does not oppose the United States' charitable relief and investment in economic construction. Surplus materials and loans should be loaned after China's peaceful unification.</p>
<p>(3) The Democratic League opposes the May 5th Constitution Draft and believes that the constitution draft passed by the Political Consultative Conference should be reviewed by the Constitution Draft Review Committee and then recognized by various parties.</p>
<p>(4) The Democratic League has no bias towards the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, so it criticizes the Kuomintang more because it is the ruling party.</p>
<p>(5) The Democratic League believes that in the areas currently controlled by the government, there is still no freedom of parties. Otherwise, the number of members of the Democratic League must exceed the number of members of the Kuomintang or the Communist Party.</p>
<p>(6) Regarding the content of Liang Shuming's conversation with Petrov, Luo Longji said that he has not yet obtained detailed information, so he could not comment.</p>
<h3>Soviet Employees of the China Changchun Railway in Shenyang Suddenly Ordered to Retreat to Their Country; Handover Started on the 3rd</h3>
<p>[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 3rd] There will be international changes in the Northeast situation. According to various signs, it seems that this is possible. The most obvious is the retreat of Soviet employees of the China Changchun Railway Branch, including 193 people such as the Director of the Soviet Shenyang Branch, Bodekemin, and 170 White Russians. This order was brought by a secretary sent by the Soviet Embassy on the 1st. Zhang Jiaao, chairman of the China Changchun Railway, and Wang Zhuting, deputy director, tried to persuade them to stay, but Bo and others said that they were ordered and could no longer stay. Therefore, from the 3rd, Bo and others have begun to handle the handover. They can leave for Dalian around Double Ten Festival and return to their country by ship. It is reported that the small number of Soviet expatriates remaining in Shenyang will also be evacuated. When the Communist army in Changchun was about to withdraw, the Soviet expatriates were ordered to evacuate in advance. Also, at the closing ceremony of the Liaoning Administrative Conference, Chairman Xu repeatedly warned all participants that the second "September 18th Incident" was about to come.</p>
<h3>The Philippines Passes Anti-Chinese Bill; Signed by President Roxas; Overseas Chinese Greatly Threatened; Our Government Will Make a Serious Representation</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 4th] After the independence of the Philippines, President Roxas was elected with an exclusionary policy. Filipinos again mistakenly regarded exclusion as patriotism, and the anti-Chinese trend resurfaced. The "Manila Vegetable Market Municipal Act", the "Filipino Labor Act", the "Filipino Retailer Act" have been passed in Congress. Among them, the Filipino Labor Act stipulates that the total wages of foreign (except American) workers in any factory shall not exceed 40% of the total wages; the Filipino Retailer Act stipulates that in the total capital of any retail store, foreign shares (excluding the United States) shall not exceed 30%. These two bills are particularly unfavorable to our overseas Chinese in the Philippines, and the latter was signed and promulgated by President Roxas on the 1st of this month and has come into effect. Overseas Chinese are greatly threatened. Our government attaches great importance to this. In addition to having telegraphed Ambassador Chen Zhiping and Consul General Duan Mao to actively negotiate, it will also make a serious representation to the Philippines.</p>
<h3>Rumors of Exchange Rate Adjustment Are Not True; Authorities Crack Down on Black Market Trading of US Dollars; Buyers at High Prices Will Be Investigated</h3>
<p>[Local News] The Shanghai Municipal Government and the Central Bank believe that the recent rise in the price of US dollars in the market is very high, and the situation is beyond the norm. It is obvious that illegal merchants are engaged in large-scale purchases, intending to make profits, which affects prices. It is urgent to find ways to stop it. The silver and money industry that has been approved by the Central Bank to buy and sell foreign currency is originally to facilitate the sporadic exchange of business travelers and obtain its legitimate profits, and should also rectify itself and assist in promoting the government's financial policy. After consultation with the Central Bank, the Municipal Government, in order to crack down on black market speculation in US dollars and stabilize the market, in addition to having the Silver and Money Exchange Industry Association notify the suspension of US dollar trading for three days, has also formulated three temporary measures for the purchase and sale of US dollars for compliance, which will be implemented from today:</p>
<p>(1) Those who are approved by the Central Bank to operate foreign currency companies shall not exceed 5% of the Central Bank's US dollar telegraphic transfer price for the purchase and sale of US dollars, and they shall not set up other names to collect fees.</p>
<p>(2) Old banknotes shall not be discriminated against, devalued, or rejected for the purchase and sale of US dollars.</p>
<p>(3) If there are large buyers who buy at high prices, the bank is allowed to secretly report to the municipal government for investigation.</p>
<p>The reporter recently learned from relevant sources that the Central Bank has recently been ordered to implement the purchase of foreign currency funds from various banks, and to purchase foreign currency deposit accounts, foreign currency margin accounts, and margins approved by the former Stabilization Fund Committee. For circulating US dollars, strict measures will be taken. In order to prevent the smuggling of US dollars, the authorities have reached an agreement with relevant countries on prevention and crackdown measures. It is expected that the price of US dollars on the black market will be reduced soon.</p>
<h3>Silver and Money Industry Association Resolves to Suspend Trading in US Dollars for Three Days</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The US dollar market situation two weeks ago was once rising in a straight line due to rumors affecting the exchange market. Although the authorities have repeatedly and resolutely denied it twice, the strong momentum of the black market US dollar has been established, and it has always been hovering around the 4,000 yuan mark. Yesterday, a certain newspaper in this city suddenly reported that the central government would make appropriate adjustments to the foreign exchange listing at any time. Various rumors in the market were rekindled, and the trend of buying US dollars became rampant. The price of US dollars soared and slammed a new high of 4,600 yuan, but the buying momentum has not slowed down. At about 10 o'clock, Wang Yuncheng, chairman of the Silver and Money Industry Association, convened an emergency board meeting to discuss emergency plans. It was decided to notify all colleagues to suspend trading in US dollars for three days from today (the 4th). In addition to sending letters for reference, it also published an announcement in the newspaper to inform the public.</p>
<p>The reporter then visited President Bei of the Central Bank. Bei was attending a meeting, and Secretary Lu Dingzhong received him on his behalf. He said: Bei did go to Beijing a few days ago for official business and returned to Shanghai yesterday morning. He did not know the details of this trip. He said: Bei did not intend to issue any statements about the various rumors in the exchange market during the autumn of market fluctuations. According to him: The rumor that the exchange rate will be adjusted frequently may be due to the suggestions of economists, but it may not be the method formulated by the Central Committee. The person who is currently spreading this message has admitted that the source of his information is inaccurate. As for the decision of the Silver and Money Industry Association in this city to suspend the trading of US dollars for three days, it was purely the automatic decision of the association.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Wang Yuncheng, chairman of the Silver and Money Industry Association, paid a visit to President Bei of the Central Bank at 5:30 p.m. yesterday to report on the suspension of US dollar trading.</p>
<h3>Import of Goods by Foreign Ships Affects the Entire Market</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] It is reported that recently, due to the high price of US dollars in this city, the trend of smuggling US dollars has turned fierce. Occasionally, when ships from foreign countries carry goods, the black market US dollars fluctuate due to the settlement of purchases, which often affects the entire financial market. In order to stabilize the financial situation and take care of the people's livelihood, the authorities will definitely crack down on US dollar transactions. It is also reported that after the expiration of the suspension of US dollar trading by the Silver and Money Industry next Monday, the authorities will take a certain attitude towards US dollar transactions.</p>
<h3>General Chen Flies to Beiping; Commander-in-Chief Gu Returns to Zhengzhou</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 4th] General Chen Cheng flew from Beijing to Beiping at noon on the 4th.</p>
<p>[Our Kaifeng Dispatch, 3rd] Commander-in-Chief of the Army Gu Zhutong returned to Zhengzhou from here at 4:00 p.m. on the 2nd. Gu and Chairman Liu Maoen inspected Xinxiang, Lanfeng, and Kaifeng, and gave some instructions on the security policy. Chairman Liu convened a joint party and government meeting on the morning of the 3rd.</p>
<h3>Deng Wenyi Hosts Reporters; Military News Agency Sends Out Drafts on National Day</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 4th] Deng Wenyi, Director of the Information Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense, held a press conference on the 4th for the establishment of the Military News Agency. Deng said: The Military News Agency will send out drafts every day starting from Double Ten Festival, and its tasks are (1) to report on military news, (2) to establish a military communication network, and (3) to provide information for military newspapers. In addition to the headquarters, the organization includes four branches in Ping, Shanghai, Zheng, and Lanzhou, and thirteen sub-stations in Tianjin, Qingdao, Changchun, Shenyang, Jinggangshan, and Guangzhou. If conditions permit, reporters will be sent to various places abroad. The political work organization of the ministry is expected to be reorganized by December. Please give more guidance to the colleagues. After the speech, Ma Xingye gave a reply on behalf of the industry. Deng also reported on the current military situation in various places.</p>
<h3>Legislative Yuan Adjusts Personnel; Zhang Zhaoyuan Appointed as Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Nanjing Dispatch, 4th] Wu Jingxiong, Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Legislative Yuan, has been reassigned as the envoy to the Holy See. President Sun recently reassigned legislator Zhang Zhaoyuan as his successor, and also served as the convener of the Foreign Affairs and Law Committee. Legislator Chen Guyuan was reassigned as the convener of the Civil Law Committee, Di Ying as the convener of the Constitution Draft Promotion Committee, Mei Ru'ao as the director of the Law Translation Committee, and Quan Zengyi as the deputy director.</p>
<h3>West of Xinhe Station on the Beining Railway; US and Communist Armies Clashed Twice; Tanggu US Army Arsenal Also Attacked</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 4th] Four miles west of Xinhe Station between Tanggu and Dagu on the Beining Railway, US and Communist armies clashed twice. At 11:00 p.m. on the 3rd, more than 20 US troops were suddenly attacked by about 600 Communist troops in the area. The two armies fought fiercely. Later, the National Army arrived after hearing the news, and armored vehicles went to support. It was not until the morning of the 4th that the siege was lifted and the Communist troops retreated. The extent of the losses is still unclear.</p>
<p>[United Press Beiping Dispatch, 4th] The US military announced today that 200 Chinese, approximately Communists, attacked the arsenal of the First Marine Division of the US Navy 15 miles west of Tanggu at 10:45 p.m. on the afternoon of the 3rd, and were not repelled until 12:05 a.m. One US soldier was slightly injured, and one Chinese was killed and one was injured. It is the first time that the Communist army has directly attacked US military equipment. The injured person has been arrested and is being interrogated by the US military.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 4th] The Beining Line suddenly became tense as the flames of war spread. In addition to the clash between the US and Communist armies in Xinhe last night, the An Ding Station between Ping and Tianjin was also suddenly attacked by the Communist army at 1:00 a.m. on the 4th. The Communist army once approached the station by 50 feet before the siege was lifted at 2:00 a.m. after armored vehicles arrived. The Communist army in Dezhou on the Jinpu Railway is also moving north, with the intention of attacking Cangxian again.</p>
<h3>Communist Army Chief of Chengxi County Wu Yi Killed</h3>
<p>[Our Jiangyin Dispatch, 4th] Wu Yi, the Communist Army Chief of Chengxi County, was killed by the National Army near Hengshan Bridge in Wujin on the 2nd during heavy rain.</p>
<h3>Death Sentence for Traitor Lin Baisheng; To Be Executed Immediately After Re-Trial</h3>
<p>Traitor Wang Yitang Accuses He Chengchao</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 4th] After Xu Ying, the wife of traitor Lin Baisheng, filed an appeal, it was rejected on the 3rd. The Ministry of Justice stated that as soon as the Supreme Court re-trials the case, the execution order will be issued quickly. Xu Ying submitted petitions to the Capital High Court and the High Court Prosecutor's Office again on the afternoon of the 4th, requesting a retrial and a stay of execution. However, according to the Prosecutor's Office, this will not affect the execution, and Lin's date of execution is not far away.</p>

<h3>Spokesperson of the National Defense Council Claims That There Has Been No Shipment of Munitions to China Recently; Ambassador Gu's Speech Thanks the United States for Its Friendship to Our Country</h3>
<p>[United Press Washington Dispatch, 3rd] In response to a question from a United Press reporter about Zhou Enlai's accusation that the Chinese government purchased munitions worth US$200 million from the United States, a spokesperson for the US State Department said: The United States has not shipped any munitions to the Chinese government forces for more than three months, and there will be no shipments of munitions to China in the near future.</p>
<p>[United Press San Francisco Dispatch, 3rd] Chinese Ambassador Gu Weijun said in a speech at the American Volunteer Army Conference here today: "The scattered and isolated calls for the withdrawal of US troops from China or the cessation of US aid to China do not represent the will of all the Chinese people. Every patriotic Chinese is well aware that the number of US troops stationed in China is limited, and their mission is to assist China in repatriating enemy expatriates and maintaining transportation. At the same time, all industrial equipment and necessities shipped to China are only to relieve China's disasters and revive China's industry and agriculture. The Chinese people are very grateful for this friendly and generous assistance that enhances China's economic and social welfare."</p>
<h3>Heavy Fighting Continues East of Huailai; Chen Jicheng Arrives in Nankou Yesterday; Railway Being Repaired Between Qinglongqiao and Kangzhuang</h3>
<p>[Our Beijing Office, 4th] Due to the government's silence on the war situation on the Ping-Sui Railway, conflicting reports have been circulating for days. According to reliable sources, the National Army has not crossed Huailai. As of noon on the 4th, fierce fighting with the Communist army was still taking place in the Daziying and Maquanzi areas east of Huailai City. The Communist army has built very strong fortifications in this area, and every time they retreat from a position, they bury landmines everywhere. Mine clearing work also takes considerable time. In addition to Li Wen, Commander-in-Chief of the 34th Army Group, who is stationed in Nankou to direct the operations, Chen Gangcheng, Deputy Commander of the 11th War Zone, has also returned from eastern Hebei and arrived in Nankou on the afternoon of the 4th to take command. It is reported that Zuo Yi sent a telegram to related parties here on the 4th, stating that several places in western Chahar have been recovered and administrative work is urgently needed. However, it was not specified which places were recovered. The Chahar Provincial Government also announced the appointment of magistrates for Wanquan and Quan'an counties on the 4th and issued a notice explaining the measures to be taken after the province recovers its territory. It was again reported that Shangyi in western Chahar was recovered by Zuo Yi's troops at 5 p.m. on the 1st. There is still no confirmation as to whether the National Army has reached Chaigoubao.</p>

<h3>Using Over 200,000 Troops, Communist Army Launches All-Out Offensive in Shandong; Zouping Captured and Then Recaptured</h3>
<p>[Our Jinan Office, 4th] The Communist army besieging Zouping County numbered over 40,000. The National Army defending the city consisted of only two battalions. They engaged in fierce battles with the Communist army from the evening of the 2nd. Due to being outnumbered, the city was captured by the Communist army on the evening of the 3rd. The National Army reinforced and counterattacked overnight, fighting with exceptional bravery, and recaptured Zouping on the morning of the 4th. The Communist army retreated to Jiukou northeast of Zouping, and the National Army is currently in pursuit.</p>
<p>[Our Jinan Office, 4th] The Communist army launched an all-out offensive on the Jiaoji Railway and on both the north and south sides, using over 200,000 troops. The National Army also reinforced and defended, inflicting heavy blows. The intensity of the fighting in the past three or four days is unprecedented in the Shandong theater. Starting on the 2nd, major battles also broke out north of the Jiaoji Railway, south of the Xiaoqing River, and near Zouping and Changshan. The main force of the Bohai Military Region, commanded by Xu Yunxiang, Commander of the 6th Military Sub-district, participated in the battle, mobilizing the main force of the concurrently held 7th Liberation Division, as well as other troops, totaling more than 27,000 men. They advanced towards Zouping City from three directions: Hanjiagzhuang north of Zouping County, Yanjiaji northwest of the city, Shangkouzhuang, and Shijiazhuang southeast of the city. The 5,000 troops in Shijiazhuang launched a fierce attack on Huangshan near the southeast of the city on the evening of the 2nd, engaging in bloody fighting with the National Army all night. On the morning of the 3rd, they reinforced and engaged in fierce battles with the National Army on the line of Lisanzhuang, Taiwangzhuang, and Yangbao. Both sides suffered heavy casualties, and fighting continued in close quarters until the afternoon. In addition, Zhao Jizhou's 7th Police Brigade of the Communist army and more than 17,000 troops from the Bohai Military Region advanced towards Changshan County from Fanchengzhuang north of Changshan County. A part of them joined the battle, but as of the afternoon of the 3rd, Zouping was still in the hands of the National Army. As for the two divisions of the Communist army that were repelled by the National Army south of Mingshui, Longshan, and Guodian stations, they were still occupying the area south and southwest of Wenzu Town, as well as Shangyouzhuang, Nanbeimingzhuang, Nanbeimiaozhuang, and Dongxicaishi on the 3rd, confronting the National Army. The Communist army's offensive has been thwarted, but they still have plans to attack the railway line again. The Communist armies of Zhangqiu and Boshan are also actively engaged. In the Jiaodong area, the Communist army launched over 40,000 troops, and fierce battles with the National Army continued in the vicinity of Jiaoxian County, with both sides suffering extremely heavy casualties.</p>
<p>[Our Xuzhou Office, 4th] According to military news, more than 20,000 Communist troops in southern Shandong launched a simultaneous attack on Lincheng from the east, west, and south on the morning of the 1st. The defending troops immediately fought back bravely, engaging in fierce battles in Feizhuang, Zaoyuan, Chenlou, and Daxiaowangzhuang, all located about five li (approximately 2.5 kilometers) east and west of Lincheng. Both sides suffered casualties, and the Communist army finally collapsed and retreated on the evening of the 2nd. Also, the Communist army in southern Shandong is currently conscripting grain on a large scale, forcibly requisitioning 10,000 jin (approximately 5,000 kilograms) of grain per village for military use.</p>
<p>[Our Jinan Office, 4th] The Jiaoji Railway traffic has been repeatedly damaged by the Communist army in recent days. On the 3rd, five sections were damaged in one day: Guodian to Longshan, Dalinchi to Wangcun, Mashang to Yazhuang, Yidu to Yangjiazhuang, and Yaogou to Tanjiafangzi. All were immediately repaired by the Railway Bureau. On the morning of the 4th, the Communist army again used landmines to destroy two sections of the roadbed between Mashang, Yazhuang, and Zhoucun, which were also repaired by the Railway Bureau, and traffic was restored as usual. The Railway Bureau will also add a special express train between Jinan and Fangzi starting on the 11th.</p>
<h3>Situation Improves in Northern Section of Ping-Han Railway; National Army Advances South from Songlindian; Railway Repair Work Progresses Alongside the Army</h3>
<p>[Our Beijing Office, 4th] The situation in the northern section of the Ping-Han Railway is expected to improve rapidly. The elite troops of the National Army that arrived at Songlindian launched a counterattack starting at noon on the 4th, advancing south along both sides of the railway. By the evening, they had reached the vicinity of Dingxing Station and were engaged in fierce battles with the Communist army. Gaobeidian and Songlindian north of Dingxing have been relieved. A relevant authority stated that it is hoped that the lost territory can be quickly recovered and traffic can be restored. Repair work is progressing alongside the army.

<h3>Liu Bocheng Flees to Hua County</h3>
<p>[Our Kaifeng Office, 3rd] Liu Ruming's Fourth Pacification Zone Headquarters has moved from here to western Shandong, and the threat to the Longhai Railway is gradually being lifted. Previously, the Communist army's Liu Bocheng Headquarters moved from Wu'an County and Juyanzhen to Heze, concentrating its main force to defend the Longhai Railway, while leaving militia in northern Henan. Local Red Spear Society and other militia groups rose up to resist, and towns and cities were being recovered daily.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Kaifeng, 4th] According to information, the Communist leader Liu Bocheng, who was defeated in Heze and went missing for a time, lost contact with his main force because the Communist army headquarters was surrounded by the National Army at that time. Liu led only a few guards and broke through the encirclement, fleeing to Juancheng. On the 2nd, he reassembled more than 500 of his officers and soldiers in that county and gave them a speech, urging his subordinates to continue serving Yan'an. That day, he fled towards Hua County.</p>
<h3>National Army Enters Handan</h3>

A total of 1,030,000 Japanese nationals have been repatriated from the Northeast (including 45,370 from the Communist-controlled areas). According to statistics, there were approximately 2 million Japanese nationals in the Northeast in the past. There are still 350,000 people waiting to be repatriated in Lushun (Port Arthur) and Dalian, which is being negotiated with the Soviet Union. There are still 110,000 to 150,000 people in the Communist-controlled areas who have not been repatriated, and approximately 500,000 people are prisoners of war in a certain country.</p>
<h3>Continued Personnel Changes in Local Commodity Tax Bureaus</h3>

<h3>Highway Construction Budget for Next Year Reaches 500 Billion; Highway Bureau is Currently Downsizing</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 4th] Relevant authorities are currently drafting the national highway construction plan for next year. It is reported that the total budget will reach over 530 billion, and the most important task will be to strengthen the major highways in the Jiangnan region to meet first-class standards. After completion, the speed of vehicles traveling on these highways can reach 60 kilometers per hour. This item alone will cost nearly 360 billion. In addition, the Highway Bureau is implementing a downsizing policy. The head office will cut 51 people, and local branch offices have also been ordered to reduce staff.</p>
<h3>Strange Phenomenon After Inter-Regional Remittances Between Inside and Outside the Passes: Only Remittances Out, No Remittances In; Imperfect Measures Create a Climate of Speculation</h3>
<p>[Our Shenyang Office, 3rd] After inter-regional remittances between inside and outside the passes were implemented, several strange phenomena immediately occurred. First, tens of millions of circulation notes flowed into the passes, while not a single penny was remitted in. Second, several banks handling remittances were lined with seven or eight hundred speculators as early as four or five in the morning, resulting in civil servants being unable to remit their family expenses. The reason is that by remitting 1,000 yuan of circulation notes to inside the passes, one can receive 11,500 yuan of legal tender, which is 2,400-2,500 yuan more than buying on the black market in Shenyang. If one remits 10,000 yuan of legal tender from inside the passes to the Northeast through the bank, one can receive 800 yuan of circulation notes in Shenyang. It is even more profitable to buy gold in Beiping and bring it to the Northeast. The price of gold in Shenyang is 29,500 yuan per puppet Manchurian yuan, which can earn approximately 10,000 yuan of circulation notes. That is, bringing 10,000 yuan of legal tender to the Northeast can buy 1,100 yuan of circulation notes. This imperfect remittance measure must be urgently rectified, otherwise the climate of speculation will become increasingly intense.</p>
<h3>Government to Regulate Yarn Prices; Nine-Member Committee of the Legislative Yuan Discussed Yesterday; Each Piece to Be Maintained at 1.5 Million</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 4th] The nine-member committee of the Legislative Yuan held a meeting at 2:30 p.m. on the 4th, attended by Zhang Zhaoyuan, Zhu Qinglin, Sun Jiulu, and others, to discuss the issue of regulating yarn prices. Minister Wang Yunwu of the Ministry of Economic Affairs attended to report and studied the measures for a long time. Finally, Wang stated that it would be more appropriate to maintain the yarn price at 1.55 million per piece through distribution methods. If commercial yarn factories do not comply, the government will make a serious statement. The discussion lasted until 4 p.m. When the reporter interviewed Sun Jiulu, the original proposer, about the discussion, he said: The conditions of people's livelihood are nothing more than clothing, food, housing, and transportation. The importance of clothing is second only to food. Over 70% of our country is farmers. Farmers have always used rice as the standard for commodity prices, and the price of one shi (approximately 59 liters) of rice was higher than the price of one pi (bolt) of cloth before the Anti-Japanese War. Now, the price of one pi of cloth is more than four times higher than the price of one shi of rice. At present, we should still find ways to restore the previous price in order to maintain people's livelihood. Before June of this year, the price of each piece of 20-count yarn was approximately 1.2 million. Based on its cost, using three and a half dan (approximately 175 kilograms) of American cotton would cost approximately 350,000, and labor costs would be approximately 250,000, so each piece should not exceed 600,000. However, it sells for only half the price, and the American cotton used is purchased from the Xingzong, which is priced lower than the market price, and the cost can be reduced further. Xingzong has sold a total of 1.5 million dan of American cotton. In this way, not only has it failed to help the people, but it has also made the people wear expensive cloth and facilitated yarn merchants to obtain exorbitant profits. This phenomenon is truly incomprehensible. In recent days, the price of American cotton has been slightly higher, at approximately 220,000 per dan. After the Shanghai power supply measures were adjusted, the cost has also increased. The cost of each piece of 20-count yarn is estimated to be three and a half dan of American cotton, totaling 770,000, factory costs approximately 450,000, and depreciation 100,000, totaling no more than 1.32 million. However, the selling price on October 1, such as 20-count special double horse, reached 2.1 million, and although the profit is slightly less than in June, it is still around 60% with proper management. Based on the above reasons, yarn prices should be regulated according to the actual cost plus legitimate profits, which can directly affect farmers and prevent the continued rise in rice prices, and indirectly stabilize general commodity prices and wages. Therefore, yarn price regulation is absolutely necessary to decide immediately.</p>
<h3>Yarn Price Surge in Hankou Stabilizes</h3>
<p>[Our Hankou Office, 4th] In order to strengthen business connections, the yarn factories here have initiated the establishment of the Hunan-Hubei-Jiangxi Yarn Weaving Industry Association with yarn factories in Jiujiang and Changsha. Also, the yarn price surge has now stabilized.</p>
<h3>Clean-Up Team's Beijing-Jiangsu Group in Suzhou; Reports Work Guidelines; Hopes All Sectors Will Provide More Input</h3>
<p>[Our Suzhou Office, 4th] The Reception and Clean-Up Team's Beijing-Jiangsu Group held a symposium at 4 p.m. on the 4th at the Enemy Property Office of the Jiangsu Branch, attended by the county's party, government, and military leaders, local figures, the press, and related reception agencies, totaling over 40 units. First, chief He Mingzhong delivered an introductory speech, and then team leader Fan Yu stood up to report on future work guidelines, divided into seven points: (1) Collect original inventories; (2) Complete a property catalog to assist in the development of construction; (3) Return civilian properties that have already been improperly received from enemy and puppet industries as soon as possible to alleviate the suffering of the people of Suzhou; (4) Accurately determine the total amount of materials currently received and stored; (5) Investigate whether the division of military supplies and non-military supplies is in accordance with government regulations; (6) Investigate whether reception agencies have reported more than they received or engaged in concealment and other corrupt practices; (7) Investigate whether reception agencies have refused to hand over assets and whether there are illegal phenomena in the Disposal Bureau. It is hoped that all sectors will provide more input, and that the team will absolutely not harbor prejudices and will handle matters impartially. The meeting adjourned at 6:30 p.m. It is learned that team leader Fan and his party are scheduled to inspect various reception warehouses and factories on the 5th, and will conduct a thorough investigation of the secretly controlled letters they have received.</p>

<h3>Mrs. Cripps Discusses Purpose of Coming to China; To Organize a Permanent Aid-China Institution</h3>
<p>[British Information Services, London, 3rd] Mrs. Cripps, on the eve of her departure from England to China, told reporters that the policy of the United Aid to China Fund has no political or religious color. After arriving in China, she will inspect all the activities of the association and hopes to visit the Communist-controlled areas. The association has already laid a common foundation for cooperation with China, but the organizational form cannot remain as it is permanently. A permanent institution must be organized and established. Therefore, another important purpose of this trip is to discuss the organization of this permanent institution with Madame Chiang Kai-shek, which can further strengthen the friendship between China and Britain. Mrs. Cripps also stated that she hopes to stay in China for six weeks.</p>

Wang Shijie, October 2, Year 35.</p>
<h3>The Truth About the CCP's Anti-Americanism Fully Exposed in Secret Documents</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Peiping, 3rd] An agency here recently seized a secret document, "Instructions on Anti-American Work," issued by the Propaganda Department of the Peiping Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) to party committees at all levels and all party members, based on the CCP Central Committee's "July 1st Decision." In this document, the CCP frankly stated that launching the anti-American movement was "for the benefit of the world proletariat," because the United States is essentially a capitalist country. Therefore, although the United States participated in World War II, "the United States is replacing fascism with fascism." Now, a new anti-fascist war is about to begin, and this arduous task falls on the Chinese Communist Party again. "Therefore, an anti-American movement must be launched extensively." It is evident that the CCP's anti-American movement has even greater ambitions. The original text is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Instructions on Work Concerning the United States: Based on the current domestic and international situation, American imperialism has already taken off its mask. For the sake of countering all conspiracies of American imperialism and for the benefit of the Chinese people and the world proletariat, we must immediately address this situation, determine the direction of our struggle, actively strike at the United States, isolate the Kuomintang reactionaries, and unite the broad masses of the people around our party. The Peiping Municipal Committee, based on the wise "July 1st Decision" of our party's Central Committee, instructs party committees at all levels and all party members as follows:</p>
<p>(1) We must clearly recognize that the United States is essentially a capitalist country. This fundamental nature determines all its policies. No matter how loudly it shouts about democracy, it will never be able to shed its imperialist face. Although it was an organizer of the anti-fascist world war, there are very clear differences between it and its ally, the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union aims to eliminate fascism, establish world peace, and ultimately seek the liberation of all mankind. The United States aims to replace fascist forces with its own, grasp world hegemony. We only need to look at the various facts in the German occupied zones and in Japan under [U.S.] control, which show the maintenance of fascist remnants, turning them into a "future force" under American protection. This proves that the United States will inherit the mantle of fascism and inevitably become the leader threatening human peace in future wars. This is why the whole world is still trapped in the terror of a "Third World War." This is the threat to human peace posed by the reactionary American capitalists.</p>
<p>(2) The United States and the Kuomintang reactionaries have had inseparable blood ties from beginning to end. This is because of their common capitalist essence. In order to seize the vast and fertile land of Northeast China and occupy 70 percent of the industrial equipment in the Northeast, the United States does not hesitate to aid the Kuomintang army in attacking the Northeast. The "Military Aid to China Act" recently proposed by Byrnes to Congress, to train one million Kuomintang troops, indicates that the United States is directly helping the Kuomintang to wage a civil war. There is no contradiction between the United States openly helping the Kuomintang to wage a civil war and sending Marshall to mediate the civil war. Marshall's mediation is precisely helping the Kuomintang. Hurley did not understand this principle and wanted to openly launch a Chinese civil war. He was opposed by American progressives and the Chinese people and stepped down. Marshall then adopted a different approach, but he will never abandon the American position of launching a Chinese civil war. Strictly speaking, Hurley was rather frank, while Marshall is more cunning. We must clearly recognize that all mediation is empty talk. Our party and our army will never be deceived by Marshall's mediation. We should be more vigilant in the future and not numbly hope for American mediation.</p>
<p>(3) The current situation is very urgent. Our party and the people of the whole country are encountering a serious crisis. A large-scale civil war is sooner or later inevitable. For the survival of our party and our army and for the benefit of the proletariat, we must attack all reactionary forces at home and abroad. First, we should educate the people of the whole country about the conspiracies of American imperialists. The following are the guiding principles for anti-American imperialism propaganda: (1) Our cadres at all levels must first mobilize within the party to make all our party members ideologically aware of the current crisis, transform their previous mentality of treating the United States as an ally, and educate the masses and themselves to deeply recognize the reactionary face of American imperialism. Stop the erroneous mentality of trying to rely on Marshall's mediation for peace. Re-arm one's own mind and oppose the mentality of seeking temporary ease and good fortune. Further propagandize to the masses that the United States is already assisting China's civil war under a false mask. Let all mediation and delays go to hell. We can only mobilize the people to prepare for a new anti-fascist democratic war to defend the fruits of victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan. This task of propaganda must first be done well within the party to educate ourselves in order to ensure the effectiveness of propaganda work among the masses. (2) Use all means to call on the people to oppose American imperialism's aggression against China and its conspiracy to fuel China's civil war. Fully expose all facts of American aggression and illegal acts. Tear down the "hypocritical mask" of the United States in front of the masses. Today, the people of Peiping have only recently been liberated from the iron hooves of the Japanese and have deep hatred for foreigners. Although the Japanese have left, they have been replaced by the Americans. We should also transplant the people of Peiping's hatred of the Japanese to the Americans, making the masses look at the Americans with the eyes of the Japanese, that is, replacing the Japanese with the Americans. All propaganda work, in addition to verbally or in writing propagandizing to all levels as much as possible, should pay special attention to the viewpoints and different interests of each social class and use them separately. In organs where party cells exist in various schools, try to establish individual connections with the Democratic League and launch democracy from the standpoint of a third party, which will be even more effective. Propaganda should also be linked to facts and should also be coordinated with propaganda work to launch direct anti-American actions by the masses: (A) Because of American assistance, civil war is bound to break out and the whole of China will fall into chaos. The general public is bound to experience the hardships of life, as they did for the past eight years, because of American aggression. The public should be called upon to immediately take action to stop the American conspiracy and to expose the atrocities of American "aid to China" to the people at any time. The facts of American troops oppressing compatriots, insulting Chinese women, military vehicles running rampant, and injuring citizens should be announced to the people at any time, and the masses should be gathered as much as possible in the streets, theaters, restaurants, and dance halls to stop the illegal acts of American troops, creating a demonstration of people's actions to raise anti-American sentiment. (B) Call on workers, national capitalists, merchants, educators, and students to point out the ambition of American economic aggression to strangle Chinese industry, which will bankrupt Chinese industrialists, cause workers to lose their jobs, education to decline, and students to drop out of school. The various classes of Peiping city should be mobilized to stop the American conspiracy through strikes, market closures, and school strikes. (C) Use all possible means to penetrate the Kuomintang army, carry out propaganda, and fully expose the conspiracy of American "military aid to China," pointing out that the United States is using Chinese people to fight a civil war, mobilizing them to put down their guns and oppose the civil war. (D) With regard to American military and civilians, point out the errors of the reactionary American policy, call for a movement of American soldiers to return home, and correct their positive view of the Kuomintang, so as to create contradictions between the Kuomintang and the American people and isolate the Kuomintang, and create contradictions among the American people themselves and isolate the warmongers. The application of this method is multifaceted. We must divide, strike at, win over, and strive to use them to make those Americans in Peiping who do not fully understand the Chinese national conditions waver and become unstable under our policies.</p>
<p>Comrades and cadres at all levels: Our anti-fascist war is about to begin. This arduous task falls on the Chinese Communist Party again. For the bright future of our party, we must extensively develop the current "oppose American imperialism" movement.</p>

<h3>Removing Artificial Obstacles in the Economy</h3>
<p>In the year since the victory, China's national economy has been in a state of upheaval due to the domestic political unrest. Recently, this economic crisis has become even more profound. As the center of the national economy, Shanghai, first had a petition delegation composed of industrial and commercial representatives petitioning in the capital, and then a petition delegation of the Shanghai Municipal Council representing the public opinion of Shanghai petitioning in the capital. We are paying attention to the economic crisis facing Shanghai and even the whole country, and we hope for government relief. Our government, from Chairman [Chiang] down, has been able to respect public opinion and agree to consider and implement the various points raised by the petition delegations. During the talks between President Soong and the petition delegations, Soong also pointed out that finance and economy are closely related. If there is no solution to finance, it is difficult to improve the economy. Conversely, the situation is the same. Soong also pointed out that the general public blames the government for only focusing on finance and neglecting the economy, but this is not entirely true. If the situation were clarified, the economy would have improved long ago. All this shows the current crux of the matter, that is, the deepening of the current economic difficulties is due to the failure to clarify the Chinese political situation. The government respects public opinion and widely adopts the situation. We firmly believe that it will be able to address both the root cause and the symptoms in order to solve the current economic difficulties, so that our national economic life will become more abundant and vibrant.</p>
<p>While we are working hard to solve the current economic difficulties, we see the following reports: (1) According to news reports, the Hong Kong government sent the Deputy Controller of the Industrial and Commercial Supplies Department to Japan to discuss the shipment of Japanese yarn and cloth to Hong Kong. He has now returned to Hong Kong and summoned the persons in charge of the Pito Trade Association to discuss the matter. He also brought back hundreds of types of cloth samples from Japan for the Pito merchants to choose and purchase. (2) The Guangzhou Yarn and Cloth Trade Union sent a telegram to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce for sympathy and assistance regarding the Executive Yuan's passage of restrictions on the shipment of yarn and cloth to Fujian and Guangdong. They appealed to the government to withdraw the order so that materials can be exchanged and needs can be met. (3) Industrial and commercial floating capital fled to Hong Kong, reaching tens of billions of yuan in recent months. Recently, a Shandong man registered with the Hong Kong government to establish a business company with a capital of 800 million Hong Kong dollars. The above three news items may not be valued by the world in this time of domestic and international turmoil, but their inherent meaning can really make us think deeply.</p>
<p>Today, when the Japanese invaders have been defeated, our national textile industry should replace the original position of the Japanese textile industry. It is only because the government does not have a complete and comprehensive policy on how to develop the national economy that even if there are excellent plans or ideals, they are often like drawing a cake to satisfy hunger. This is mostly due to the failure to clarify the domestic situation, resulting in the failure to implement some plans that have been considered several times; but it seems unfair to attribute all responsibility to the failure to clarify the situation. Even under the current situation where the situation has not been clarified, the government should make every effort to make our immature and troubled national industry more vibrant. At present, my country's textile industry is showing a deformed prosperity due to the special circumstances, but from the perspective of the national economy, this may not necessarily be a healthy sign. According to the recent statement made by President Soong to the Shanghai Municipal Council's petition delegation, the situation in South China is better at present, while North China is affected by transportation obstruction and transportation cannot be smooth. We do not understand why there is another artificial obstacle in South China, where the situation is better, to make production and trade stagnate? Indeed, the difficulties currently placed on the Chinese national economy due to artificial obstacles may be even greater than the failure to clarify the situation. The prevalence of high interest rates, unfair tax burdens, and the construction of trade barriers are all artificial factors, and it seems impermissible to completely shift them to the political situation.</p>
<p>In order to make our national economy recover, we should first eliminate these artificial factors. Because of these artificial obstacles, we see the escape of funds and the shrinking of production and trade. Under such circumstances, it will be inevitable for Japanese industry to regain its pre-war market and position. If we lose this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, the future development of our national economy will be more severely hit. In order to preserve a bit of vitality for the country, we call on you: quickly remove these artificial obstacles!</p>
<h3>Control of Atomic Energy</h3>
<p>The United Nations Atomic Energy Control Commission continued its general assembly on the 2nd at Lake Success in New York. The chairman of the commission, Dr. Hsia Chin-lin, the representative of our country, reminded the representatives of various countries at the beginning of the discussion, saying: "No important achievements have been made in previous meetings, so in the future we must enter practical issues from general principles and achieve results." Then he put forward a suggestion that effective measures should be taken to resolve the differences of opinion between the countries. These words came from the mouth of Dr. Hsia Chin-lin, the representative of our country and also the chairman of the United Nations Atomic Energy Control Commission, which is enough to symbolize the lofty spirit of our country and should win the admiration of the general public.</p>
<p>Since the US military dropped atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, mankind has entered a new era. The use of atomic energy can bring infinite happiness to mankind, and it can also destroy the entire human race and the civilization it has created. Regarding how to control the use of atomic energy, because Britain, the United States, and Canada jointly worked on the manufacture of atomic bombs during the war, while the Soviet Union did not participate, they hold different views. In fact, the use of atomic energy, like other scientific inventions, is originally the accumulation of research by scientists from various countries, and there is no secret here. Only in the manufacture of atomic bombs, there may be some technical problems that are not generally known to scientists. Because the Soviet Union did not participate in the manufacture of atomic bombs, and the use of atomic bombs will completely change future wars, the Soviet Union advocates prohibiting the manufacture and use of atomic energy weapons, and must destroy the existing atomic energy weapon materials within three months. The reasons for the proposal of this proposal are naturally obvious, and its failure to be accepted by Britain and the United States is naturally expected. In Britain and the United States, what they emphasize is control rather than abolition, which is fundamentally incompatible with the Soviet Union's views. Because of this difference of opinion, the United Nations Atomic Energy Control Commission has repeatedly convened meetings, and no agreement has been reached. Under this situation, we are happy to hear the instructions of Dr. Hsia Chin-lin, the representative of our country and the chairman of the conference. Our country did not actually participate in the manufacture of atomic bombs, and the situation is the same as that of the Soviet Union. Because there are different opinions on the control of atomic energy, with the transcendent position of our country, we sincerely hope to shorten the distance between the differences of opinion and be able to obtain valuable agreements on the control of atomic energy.</p>
<p>However, the reason why there are differences of opinion on the control of atomic energy is of course not in the atomic energy itself, but should be sought elsewhere. The control of atomic energy is only regarded as a ball for everyone to kick around. Prohibiting the use of atomic energy is like refusing to eat for fear of choking, which does not seem to be a good solution. Because the use of atomic energy can also bring infinite happiness to mankind. Therefore, we should control the use of atomic energy at this time, so that the use of atomic energy can be transformed from the aspect of destruction to the aspect of increasing human happiness, which is the true meaning of creation and the progress of mankind.</p>

<h3>Hangzhou's Ban on Prostitution Ineffective; Women's Forum Focuses on Discussion</h3>
<p>[Hangzhou Dispatch] The Zhejiang Provincial Women's Association recently promoted the Hangzhou Women's Association to convene a forum on the issue of banning prostitution with women from all walks of life on a regular basis. Since the restoration of Hangzhou, the city government has tried its best to rectify the city appearance, and has paid special attention to the issue of prostitution. The Zhejiang Provincial Police Department has strictly arrested, detained, photographed, and fined prostitutes, but to no avail. The ban on prostitution has no support in reality, and only increases the disturbance of social order. Therefore, a forum was launched to seek a reasonable solution.</p>

<h3>Changjiangbu Accepts Bribery; Petty Officers Are Audacious and Reckless</h3>
<p>[Our Hankou Dispatch, 3rd] Miao Peicheng and He Hanwen, members of the Hunan-Hubei Suppression Corps, recently returned from Changjiangbu in Yingcheng after investigating the case. They told reporters about the investigation into the military's theft and sale of supplies: The corps had previously received a confidential report:</p>
<p>Worth 2 Billion Dollars</p>
<p>"Changjiangbu in Yingcheng County is an important town on the Hankou-Yichang Road. During the occupation, the enemy built barracks and stored a large amount of supplies there. After the enemy surrendered, the first to enter the town to take over were Sun Ziyan, the battalion commander, Jin Shixiang, the company commander, and Chen Dazhen, etc., of the Engineer Battalion of the 75th Army. According to local people, the supplies received were worth at least 2 billion dollars. The battalion has been stealing and selling these supplies for more than a year. Although the troops have long since departed, they have still set up a guard post to continue stealing and selling supplies. The people responsible for this are manager Zhao Yizhao and platoon leader Yu Lishan. Recently, as the supplies are about to be stolen and sold out, they have even demolished houses and sold the materials to local people." After receiving the news, the corps immediately sent members Miao Peicheng and He Hanwen to Changjiangbu on the 2nd of this month, along with Yao Chongxian, a prosecutor from the Military Law Department of the Executive Yuan, and military police, to conduct an on-site investigation. They returned to Hankou tonight after completing their work. The results of the investigation: (1) Regarding the concealment, theft, sale, and destruction of enemy supplies: (A) There are 15 motor wooden boats parked on the river surface on the outskirts of the town, and several of them have already been broken and sunk in the water. A closer inspection reveals that the markings on these ships are all enemy-made, but the battalion has abandoned them for a long time, allowing them to be destroyed, without reporting or repairing them. There is a serious suspicion that they intentionally abandoned the received supplies, and according to local people, these eleven motor wooden boats existed when the enemy was there, and the battalion is suspected of concealing the received enemy supplies and failing to report them. (B) There are many scattered supplies stored in the guard post of the Engineer Battalion. Among them, the more important ones that are obviously left by the enemy include five folding boats, three folding boat motors, one crane, and more than 30 barrels of various oils for vehicles and ships, stored in a total of eleven rooms.</p>
<h3>Private Sales Confirmed</h3>
<p>(C) Regarding the theft, sale, and transportation of all received supplies, Yu Lishan claimed that they were transported to the warehouse of the Lianyutao Division in Wuchang for storage, but there is no clear record of how much has been transported. As for the continued private sale of daily necessities in the town, many local people confirmed that this was indeed the case. (2) Regarding the demolition of houses, according to the investigation, the barracks built by the enemy in Changjiangbu were originally intact, and the underground was paved with floors and Japanese tatami mats. Since the battalion was stationed there, they have been dismantling them one after another. By the time it was officially handed over to the Changjiangpu Township Office, not only were the floors and tatami mats all gone, but most of the houses were also badly damaged. As of the time of the inspection, there were still many disassembled timbers stored in one room. Based on the evidence, the guard post privately demolished the barracks and sold the materials for profit without a doubt. In addition, when members Miao and He arrived at the location for investigation, the place was in a mess and no one was in charge. After several attempts to find Yu Lishan, the platoon leader in charge of the post, for questioning, Yu Lishan was playing cards with his colleagues, saying that he could not come until he finished playing. It was determined that Yu Lishan and others not only disregarded the law, but also openly obstructed official duties. Therefore, Yao Chongxian, the prosecutor from the Military Law Department of the Executive Yuan, arrested them on the spot and sent them to the Military Law Department of the Executive Yuan for interrogation on the same day. It is reported that in addition to the gambling part of the case involving platoon leader Yu Lishan and three others, which has been investigated by the Military Law Department, Sun Ziyan, the battalion commander, Jin Shixiang, the company commander, Chen Dazhen, and Zhao Yizhao, the manager, of the 75th Engineer Battalion, all have their respective responsibilities. The entire case was submitted to the Wuhan Executive Yuan for approval yesterday.</p>

<p>Petrified Suburban Transportation</p>
<p>Although the public transportation situation in this city is not entirely satisfactory, the number of public vehicles in the central area has increased to a considerable number. However, public transportation in the suburbs and slightly remote areas has not yet developed. In particular, many residents live in areas such as the city center, which had many residents before the war and was once the hub of the New Shanghai Construction Plan. Many pre-war residents now hope to return to their original homes, but they dare not do so because of inconvenient transportation and insecure public security. Before the war, there were vehicles of the Huashang Public Automobile Company running, connecting the routes from Beizhan, Sheng Baoshan Road, Jiangwan Road, and Xiti Yu Hui Road with the central area (former concession), which was convenient for residents. People moved to the city center, resulting in the emerging scene before the war. Even during the Japanese occupation, there were public vehicles running, and there was even a so-called "Emerging Station" established. Unexpectedly, one year after the victory, not only has the transportation before the war not been restored, but even the scale that the Japanese had already established has disappeared, which is regrettable. A few days ago, it was heard that the Public Utilities Bureau ordered the British Public Automobile Company to resume operations immediately and respond before November, but they are tight-lipped about the resumption of operations of the Huashang Public Automobile Company. Several months ago, it was reported that Manager Wang of the company returned to China from the United States to plan the resumption of the company's operations, but there has been no follow-up, for some reason. At a time when there is a serious housing shortage in the city and the authorities are encouraging pre-war residents to return and rebuild their homes, it is not known whether any measures have been taken to establish the prerequisite of transportation.

<p>Issue National Identity Cards Quickly!</p>
<p>We are a group of refugees from Huai'an in northern Jiangsu, living in Changzhou for more than a year. Last month, the National Army entered our hometown of Huai'an, and we were preparing to pack our bags and return home by a detour. We received a letter from a friend in Xuzhou, saying that there were no other accidents along the way under the protection of our National Army, but to take a car from Xuzhou, you must carry a national identity card to board the car, and the inspection is very strict. However, national identity cards are only issued in the three major cities of Beijing, Shanghai, and Zhenjiang, and the counties along the Beijing-Shanghai line have not yet started. The number of refugees in various counties is not small. Who does not miss their hometown? I hope that the administrative officials of the various counties will immediately process the certificates so that the fellow countrymen who have been displaced can return to their homes and reunite with their families as soon as possible.

<p>A Good School, But No Place to Live!</p>
<p>I remember that more than two months ago, in order to take the entrance examination for Jiaotong University, I lived the most tense and hardest life of my life, preparing my lessons day and night for a whole month. Under the scorching heat, I endured many hardships along the way, and I was fortunate enough to be admitted to Industrial Management from Yixing. At that time, I was extremely excited because this was a small reward I had received from hard work!</p>
<p>But unfortunately, something else happened. On the enrollment advertisement of Jiaotong University, didn't it say "All admitted freshmen must live on campus"? In the past, I had imagined that the authorities of Jiaotong University might be able to find a way to make it easier, but now? It's just a pipe dream. How can I, who am so poor that I don't even have gold scraps, solve this accommodation problem that requires gold bars as a condition? Seeing the tall buildings, I am troubled by this difficult situation!</p>
<p>I think that of the 792 students admitted by Jiaotong University, except for a very small number of students living in Shanghai, all are anxious about this lack of residence. We don't want to be forced to abandon our studies because of this small difficulty of not having a place to live, so we hope that people from all walks of life who care about students can give us an appropriate solution. (Shi Zengyao, student from Yixing)</p>

<h3>Molotov Returns Home for Instructions; Speculation About a Three-Power Meeting Runs Rampant</h3>
<p>[News Agency] Paris, 4th (Broadcast): Molotov, the Soviet representative to the Paris Peace Conference, flew back to Moscow for the second time today to consult with Stalin. However, he is expected to return to Paris next week to chair the plenary session of the Peace Conference. This trip by Mr. Molotov has sparked speculation about a possible summit between Stalin, Attlee, and Truman in the near future.</p>
<p>[News Agency] London, 4th (Broadcast): Byrnes met with Bevin today to discuss the procedures for the Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference to be held next month.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 3rd] The recent demands from unofficial sources in the United States and Britain to revise their policies towards the Soviet Union have led diplomats here to study two issues: whether Britain is brewing a revision of its relations with the United States and the Soviet Union, and whether Britain is about to act as an intermediary between the United States and the Soviet Union. Former British Foreign Secretary Eden once advocated repairing relations with the Soviet Union in a new spirit and with new approaches. The day after Eden's speech, Soviet Chairman Stalin expressed his welcome. Recently, some British newspapers have supported Eden's proposal, and many have severely criticized the United States for continuing to pursue a tough policy towards the Soviet Union, even saying that US Secretary of State Byrnes has gone too far. For example, the London or Times newspaper stated that Eden and Stalin's mutual responses are timely signals to restore the public's desire for stable relations. However, despite such calls in London, British officials in Washington firmly stated that the country's government does not intend to change its foreign policy, saying that the calls in London are just political maneuvers, and that even if Eden becomes Foreign Secretary again, it will not cause a major change in British foreign policy.</p>
<h3>Peace Conference Procedures: Four Foreign Ministers Have Decided; General Assembly to Convene Tomorrow to Review Committee Reports; Each Delegation's Speech Limited to Thirty Minutes</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 4th] The four foreign ministers held a meeting last night to discuss the final procedures for the peace conference's plenary session. Guo Fengqi, the deputy head of the Chinese delegation to the peace conference, originally intended to represent Foreign Minister Wang Shijie but did not attend at the request of Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov. Molotov believed that the meeting was only to discuss procedural matters, so it was better to hold a meeting of the four foreign ministers instead of the originally scheduled meeting of the five foreign ministers. The Secretary-General of the Peace Conference, French representative Mr. Dubar, also attended the meeting as he was responsible for drafting the procedures. The meeting was chaired by U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes, who mentioned a letter from the President of the United Nations General Assembly, Belgian Foreign Minister Spaak. Byrnes will consult with Spaak on the procedures for the peace conference. The four foreign ministers decided that the peace conference's plenary session should review the five-nation peace treaties in accordance with the procedures adopted at the previous Moscow Conference. The reports of the various committees of the peace conference shall be reviewed according to the following procedures: first, political reports; second, military reports; and third, economic reports. The four foreign ministers further decided, in accordance with Spaak's suggestion, not to review the original texts of the treaties with a clause-by-clause approach, but to conduct a comprehensive review. Amendments passed by the various specialized committees shall be reviewed according to the following procedures: first, amendments passed by a two-thirds or more majority; and second, amendments passed by a simple majority. No delegation may submit new amendments, and each delegation's speech is limited to thirty minutes. At the same time, the peace conference is scheduled to hold a plenary session at 4:00 PM on the 6th to discuss and approve the procedures drafted by Secretary-General Dubar. The review of the treaty with Italy will then begin and is expected to be completed within three days. It is hoped that the treaties with the remaining four countries can be reviewed and completed within four days. The peace conference may conclude its work before the deadline of the 15th of this month.</p>
<h3>Discussion on Compensation Issues: The Soviet Union Attacks the United States Again</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Paris, 4th broadcast: As the work of the peace conference committee comes to an end, the Soviet Union has once again launched a furious attack on the United States, accusing the United States of undermining the four-power agreement and attempting to obtain economic privileges from Italy. After Molotov flew to Moscow, Soviet representative Arutyunyan led the speech. When discussing the Australian proposal to organize a special compensation committee to handle Italian reparations, with the U.S. representative as chairman, Arutyunyan launched a major attack, stating that the United States' unilateral abandonment of seeking compensation from Italy would give the United States "special powers" if the United States served as chairman. When the committee passed the proposal by a vote of twelve to eight, Arutyunyan vigorously criticized the United States for violating the four-power agreement that the draft peace treaty could not be amended.</p>
<h3>Military Committee's All-Night Meeting: Final Report Passed</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Paris, 4th broadcast: The Peace Conference Military Committee held a meeting that lasted nine hours and fifty-five minutes, and this morning submitted its final report on the military aspects of the five-nation peace treaties. Although the Soviet bloc strongly opposed the report, claiming that it violated the four-power resolution, the Military Committee finally passed the report by a vote of fifteen to six. The six dissenting votes were cast by the Soviet Union, Belarus, Ukraine, Yugoslavia, and Czechoslovakia. The Soviet bloc most strongly opposed the recommendations for the complete demilitarization of Bulgaria along the Greek border in Thrace, and the prohibition of Bulgaria from possessing minesweepers.</p>

<h3>Soviet Union Proposes Issue of International Armed Forces</h3>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, USA, 4th] General Keane, head of the United States delegation to the Military Staff Committee of the United Nations, declared today that the Soviet representative had recently proposed the organization of international armed forces, breaking the stagnant situation of the committee since May. Keane's remarks were made after the Security Council of the United Nations submitted a report to the United Nations General Assembly. It is said that the Military Staff Committee has been at a standstill since the spring because the Soviet Union has failed to provide opinions jointly with the United States, Britain, France, China, and other countries. According to reports, the meetings of the Military Staff Committee have been extremely confidential since its meeting in March, and Keane's remarks today are the first to directly mention the situation. The Military Staff Committee was ordered by the Security Council to meet and discuss the plan to organize international armed forces. According to the report of the Security Council, the United States, Britain, China, and France submitted proposals separately before the deadline of April 3, but the Soviet Union stated that it was not yet prepared to submit any constructions until July 15. According to the final decision, countries around the world will not permanently hand over their military forces to the United Nations, but they can be lent to the United Nations for use, or be subject to the Security Council's dispatch.</p>

<h3>Japan's Adoption of the Southern Advance Policy Intended to Prevent German Ambitions</h3>
<p>Contained in the Report of the Former German Ambassador to Siam</p>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 4th dispatch] The International Tribunal today read out the report of the former German Ambassador to Siam to his home country in July 1941, proving that Japan originally intended to attack the Soviet Union, but suddenly changed its plans and implemented the Southern Advance Policy. It is said that Japan initially planned to occupy the coastal provinces of Soviet Northern Sakhalin and other areas. As Japan had no hope of conquering China, the military authorities decided to cease operations, while controlling the coastal strongholds of China and the Kwantung Army implemented the Northern Advance Policy. If Japan attacked the Soviet Union, the United States would not join the war. However, ten days later, Japan changed its plans and notified its military attachés abroad, stating that it would stop Britain and the United States from hindering Japan's expansion of its power, and with the support of Germany and Italy, it would occupy Vietnam as a military springboard. The next step was to issue an ultimatum to the Dutch East Indies, and the Japanese Navy occupied Singapore, taking on an important mission. The above evidence was presented by the French prosecutor to prove that Japan was deeply concerned that Germany wanted to occupy the South Pacific markets, so before Germany could conquer Britain, it rushed to occupy Vietnam as a control point.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Circles Mourn Li and Wen; Speaker Pan Speaks at the Assembly; Elaborates on the True Meaning of Democracy; Strives to Achieve Peaceful Reunification of China; To Comfort the Deceased in the Afterlife</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Yesterday morning at 9:00 AM, all circles in the city held a memorial service for Mr. Li Gongpu and Mr. Wen Yiduo at the Tianchan Theater. The participants were extremely crowded, with more than 4,000 people. The venue was solemnly decorated.

(2) Democracy should have a spirit of abiding by the law. Mr. Li and Mr. Wen died at the hands of those who did not abide by the law, so we should promote the rule of law even more. Following this, Ms. Shi Liang reported on the life of Mr. Li Gongpu and the details of his murder. Professor Chu Tunan then described Mr. Wen Yiduo's life of poverty and hard work.</p>
<p>When Speaker Pan Gongzhan was invited to stand up and speak, the audience applauded thunderously. Pan said sadly: "Today, all circles in Shanghai are mourning Mr. Li Gongpu and Mr. Wen Yiduo. I believe that not only those present express their grief, but also the citizens of Shanghai, when they heard the news of Mr. Li and Mr. Wen being sold out, were saddened and regretted the loss of talent to the country. I have had a 20-year friendship with Mr. Li, and although I have never met Mr. Wen, I have also been reading Mr. Wen's works for 20 years. The two gentlemen ran education and wrote articles. As a friend and a fellow professional, I feel particularly sad to attend this meeting. The two gentlemen sacrificed themselves for the pursuit of democracy, which is a loss to the country, and we should all cry together. However, we should remember that if we want to pursue democracy, we should know how to pursue it. As long as we can build China into a democratic, peaceful, unified, and strong country, then the two gentlemen can rest in peace in the afterlife (the audience applauded enthusiastically). We, the survivors, have no other way to comfort them, but to do everything possible to achieve this goal. But it is not easy to put China on the road to democracy. The Chinese nation has had thousands of years of history since the invention of writing. It is an old and outdated country. How difficult it will be to turn it over and transform it into a modern democratic country! Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the founding father of the nation, led the Kuomintang in 50 years of revolution, striving for the Three Principles of the People, to build a modern and democratic new China. (Loud applause) However, "democracy" and "democracy" have different interpretations in today's world. Americans say that American democracy is a typical democracy, and Soviets say that Soviet democracy is the newest democracy. Which system is correct? Mr. Zhao Dan said in his eulogy about "the bridge between the United States and the Soviet Union." That's right! China should be the bridge between the United States and the Soviet Union. Not only should we be the bridge between the United States and the Soviet Union in the international situation, but we should also be the bridge between the United States and the Soviet Union in the democratic system. The Three Principles of the People, which are the foundation of our country, are truly the bridge between the United States and the Soviet Union! (The whole venue applauded repeatedly and called for support). If we simply and blindly learn from the United States, or stubbornly follow the Soviet Union, we are not worthy of being the bridge between the United States and the Soviet Union. If China wants democracy, it can only sincerely and earnestly implement the Three Principles of the People. And most importantly, everyone should cultivate two kinds of demeanor: one is the demeanor of allowing people to speak freely, to criticize and discuss freely; and the other is the demeanor of those who speak and criticize having their own sense of propriety and being responsible for their own words. In today's China, any place where there is only one-sided speech and no other opinions are allowed to be expressed, where only one party is allowed to exist and no other parties are seen to be active, that place is not democratic. (Loud applause) The true model of democracy is probably in today's meeting place. Today, there are people from all parties and factions, and there are people who are non-partisan. Everyone speaks and respects each other, demonstrating true democracy. What Mr. Li and Mr. Wen sacrificed to seek was democracy. When we come to mourn them, we should work together in this spirit to achieve peaceful reunification of China and realize the Three Principles of the People, so that we can be worthy of the two gentlemen" (Loud applause).</p>
<p>Mr. Guo Moruo</p>
<p>then rose to speak, holding a manuscript and reciting it aloud, painfully describing the great spirit of Li and Wen, and said that foreigners criticize the Chinese for being selfish and self-interested. Passive selfishness is "self-preservation," and active selfishness is "I would rather betray others." Finally, he compared Mr. Li and Mr. Wen to Confucius and Jesus. Ms. Deng Yingchao represented Zhou Enlai and came to the venue to read a eulogy, which said: "Today, we are here to mourn Mr. Li Gongpu and Mr. Wen Yiduo. The situation is extremely dangerous, and people's hearts are extremely sad and angry. But at this time and in this place, what else can we say? I would like to solemnly swear to the martyrs with the most sincere belief: our hearts will not die, our will will not be extinguished, peace can be expected, democracy is hopeful, and those who kill will eventually be destroyed!"</p>
<p>Mr. Luo Longji</p>
<p>said that he had been with Mr. Li and Mr. Wen for a long time and had a deep friendship with them, and expressed his pain, but he said, "Today we are not mourning here, but celebrating that the spirit of these two friends of ours is immortal. They had long been prepared to sacrifice for democracy." He also said: "The democracy we want is for the people to be able to live. Dr. Sun Yat-sen said in his legacy: 'Peace and democracy will save China.' There must be peace for there to be democracy."</p>
<p>Finally,</p>
<p>Mrs. Zhang Manyun, the wife of Li Gongpu, delivered a thank-you speech on behalf of the families of Li and Wen, with tears in her eyes. She expressed her gratitude to the government leaders, friends, and guests for their enthusiastic participation and assistance in holding this meeting. She also said: "This makes me even more convinced that they are not dead. Their spirit will always be in everyone's heart and will not be forgotten." The memorial service began to disperse after playing funeral music at 11:00 AM.</p>

<h3>Miserable Death of the Two Zang Sons Case: Local Court Decides to Handle it with Independent Spirit, Summons Relevant Witnesses for Questioning on the 9th</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Regarding the Zang brothers' case, the District Prosecutor's Office has been actively investigating for days, collecting materials from all sides, and has scheduled a preliminary hearing for the 9th of this month to summon relevant witnesses for questioning. According to a certain responsible person in the District Court who spoke to our reporter: the court will handle this case with the spirit of judicial independence and will not be influenced by any political propaganda. They also said: According to the investigation results, the murderer is known to be a US Navy soldier. It is heard that the US military authorities have already detained the suspect. According to the Sino-US wartime reciprocal agreement, if active Chinese and American military personnel violate criminal law, they will be directly tried by their respective military authorities. Therefore, if the murderer is indeed an active US military member, the case will be handed over to a US military court.</p>
<h3>City Council and City Party Headquarters Host Taiwan Tribute Mission: Head of Delegation Lin et al. Express Deep Hope for Peaceful National Construction; Chen Xin States that Taiwan's Administration Should Be Further Reformed</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Taiwan Restoration Tribute Mission, represented by National Political Council members Lin Xiantang and Chen Yisong, mission advisor Qiu Nianxian, and other representatives Huang Chaoqing, Lin Shuhuan, Lin Weigong, Ye Rongzhong, Zhang Jifu, Mei Zhenxiang, Li Jianxing, Zhong Fan, as well as mission finance committee member Chen Xin, secretaries Chen Zaiheng, Li Desong, Lin Xian, and others, fifteen people in total, who came to Shanghai via Nanjing and other inland cities after visiting the capital, are scheduled to return to Taiwan today. Yesterday at 3:00 PM, City Council Speaker Pan hosted a reception for the delegates and members of the local press at the New Life Club.</p>
<p>Speaker Pan began by delivering a speech, stating roughly: Taiwan was separated from the motherland for fifty years. It was only after this war of resistance that it was able to return to the embrace of the motherland. The compatriots of the whole country not only rejoice for the people of Taiwan but also celebrate for themselves. It is believed that after the eight years of the war of resistance, the gentlemen present have a profound understanding of the motherland. Currently, Taiwan's administration, economy, and politics are in a transitional period. It is also believed that the compatriots in Taiwan hope that all systems can be the same as in other parts of the country. This point will certainly be achieved in the future, and it can show that China is a unified country. Then, Lin Xiantang, the head of the delegation, gave a speech, saying that Taiwan was fortunate to have relied on the struggle and resistance of the national military and people during the past eight years, and finally achieved restoration. In the past fifty years, the people of Taiwan suffered from the Japanese people's policy of enslavement, tasted the enemy's destruction and coercion, but we have always strived to unite and maintain our inherent culture. Today, Taiwan has returned to the embrace of the motherland, like a little brother, hoping that the elder brother will give more guidance and leadership and work together to build a new country. The domestic disputes should be resolved peacefully as soon as possible, so that the construction is hopeful, which is also the unanimous hope of the 6.3 million compatriots in Taiwan. Then, Qiu Nianxian, the advisor of the delegation, reported four points of observation: (1) Returning to the motherland this time, I feel close and enthusiastic, which makes us enjoy the warmth of the family. (2) In the past fifty years, the compatriots in Taiwan have been alienated due to the Japanese people's separation, resulting in a lot of estrangement, but now we understand. (3) We are very saddened to see brothers quarreling in the motherland. We have suffered the pain of subjugation for fifty years and deeply hope that the country will quickly embark on the road to a strong country. (4) I hope the country will seek peace as soon as possible and resume reconstruction. I also hope that the compatriots in the country will not discriminate against the compatriots in Taiwan. In fact, the 6.3 million compatriots in Taiwan are all purely Chinese.</p>
<p>Afterwards, Mr. Chen Qi replied to reporters' inquiries about the industrial and commercial situation in Taiwan, saying: Currently, industry and commerce are still in the process of being taken over. The reason for the delay in the handover is that in the past, industry and commerce were entirely in the hands of Japanese people. Once taken over, manpower and financial resources are insufficient. In the future, it should be developed in two stages: (1) Complete the takeover work and continue production, (2) Restore the pre-war state. (3) Improve and increase production.</p>
<p>Political Council member Chen Yisong replied regarding the opinions on Taiwan's administrative governor's office: (1) The people of Taiwan hope that the central government can abolish the system of the administrative governor's office and establish a provincial government system. (2) Governor Chen Yi has good morals and scholarship, but because he has too many ideals that are not practical, he only creates a bureaucratic system.</p>
<p>Finally, Speaker Pan, in the position of a member of the press, hopes that in the near future, reporters from Beijing and Shanghai can organize a Taiwan sightseeing group, and is willing to meet the representatives again in Taiwan.</p>
<p>In addition, yesterday, in order to welcome the representatives of the city's party members, the City Party Headquarters, led by Director Fang, issued invitations to all the representatives of the delegation to hold a tea party at 9:00 AM in the Dadong Auditorium on the third floor of Wing On Company.</p>

They are recorded below: Chiang Kai-shek's telegram, "To Committee Member Xu Ruwei, Dear Sir: On the occasion of the Double Ninth Festival, coinciding with your birthday, the country celebrates the longevity of its upright people, who are healthy and increasingly vigorous.

President Ju's telegram: "To Shanghai He Siyi, Dear Brother: On the occasion of Ru Gong and his wife's double birthday, I am unable to come to the hospital.

<h3>MGM's New Film to Be Shown at the Grand Theater: Mandarin Dubbed Explanation Attracts Audiences with Utmost Care</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] In order to win over Chinese audiences in the Far East market who do not understand English, American film producers have invented a new technology after adding Chinese explanations to the films. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer has invented Mandarin explanations for the films. When the film is shown, the soundtrack simultaneously emits Mandarin explanations to explain the English dialogues of the characters in the movie, while not interfering with the original dialogues and musical accompaniment of the entire film. The company's first film to be equipped with this Mandarin explanation is the new film "Tarzan's New York Adventure," which is said to be shown at the Grand Theater soon. A screening was held for various circles the other morning.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang People Save Zhejiang, Zhejiang People Build Zhejiang: Shen Honglie's Purpose in Coming to Shanghai is to Raise an 800 Million Yuan Fund to Repair the Qianjiang Yidu and Xixing Wharf, Deeply Hoping that Fellow Townsmen in Shanghai Will Join in the Righteous Cause</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Zhejiang Provincial Chairman Shen Honglie arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon. Leaders from various circles in Zhejiang, including Xu Jiqing, Pan Gongzhan, Wang Xiaolai, Shou Yicheng, Wang Zhengting, and Qian Xinzhi, welcomed him at the International Hotel at 4:00 PM, attended by industrial and commercial figures from Shanghai such as Chu Fucheng, Gui Yanfang, and Hu Xiyuan, as well as Zhejiang Provincial Assembly Speaker Zhang Qiang, Civil Affairs Director Ruan Yicheng, Construction Director Pi Zuoli, and Special Commissioner Yu, Section Chief Zhou, Xu Hao, Jin Runquan, Chen Cheng, etc., who came from Hangzhou. Wang Xiaolai presided over the banquet.</p>
<p>Wounds and Scars Everywhere, Small Towns Especially Severe</p>
<p>Chairman Shen reported on the political situation in Zhejiang Province, stating roughly that since taking office, he has inspected 35 counties. Only 7 counties are intact. 70% of the remaining counties are 100% destroyed. The destruction of small towns is especially severe. It is truly a sight of wounds and scars! More than 20 counties in the province's rivers are suffering. More than 800,000 acres of farmland have been destroyed, greatly affecting production. Therefore, the current important policies are to reduce the people's burden and to urgently seek local construction. The former has ordered the abolition of unnecessary taxes and strictly prohibited apportionments. The central government has also approved the reduction of land tax to 5.567% to 50%. The latter is to repair water conservancy. Starting from November 1, Jinan, Qiantang River and Qianjiang Ferry and Xixing Wharf will be repaired first. It is expected that one-third of the province's water conservancy projects or one-fifth of all projects will be completed within the year.</p>
<p>Utilizing Civil Power to Repair Transportation</p>
<p>In terms of increasing grain production, the province is still short of 2 to 3 million dan. It is expected that it will be self-sufficient within three years, and this year it can increase production by more than 600,000 dan. In short, the current direction of administrative work is to seek the people's peace and prosperity. This year's total budget is over 24 billion, and the income is only 6.8 billion. Even with the central government's subsidy, it is still short of 9 billion. The provincial government's policy of building Zhejiang has two principles: not increasing the people's burden and not relying on the central government. Therefore, on the one hand, it utilizes civil power, mobilizing the province's national compulsory labor to repair transportation, and on the other hand, it has negotiated with the Zhejiang-Fujian branch of the Executive Yuan to obtain 21,000 tons of flour to be used for the construction of large and small water conservancy projects, provincial and county roads, houses, and sanitation facilities.</p>
<p>Floating Capital Flows to Rural Areas of This Province</p>
<p>On the one hand, under the slogan of "Zhejiang People Save Zhejiang, Zhejiang People Build Zhejiang," it is hoped that the Zhejiang compatriots in Shanghai will allow the large amount of floating capital in Shanghai to flow to the rural areas of this province and build transportation and production projects in their counties. The people can reduce their burden; the government is willing to take responsibility and provide guarantees. The biggest purpose of my visit here is to first repair the Qianjiang Ferry and Xixing Wharf, raising a fund of 800 million yuan, and deeply hope that fellow townsmen in Shanghai will enthusiastically complete this righteous act to facilitate transportation between eastern and western Zhejiang. Chu Fucheng, Xu Jiqing, Zhang Qiang, and others gave speeches, expressing gratitude for Shen's virtuous policies and deep hope for the assistance of fellow townsmen. According to Shen, he will stay in Shanghai for three days before returning to Hangzhou.</p>
<h3>Jiangjing Wheel Starts Sailing to Ningbo Today: China Merchants Bureau Hosts Visit</h3>
<p>(Report from Our Newspaper) The China Merchants Bureau has increased the number of Jiangjing wheels sailing on the Shanghai-Ningbo line. Yesterday afternoon at 4:00, it specially invited all circles to visit Jiangjing, and Liu Hongsheng, Chairman of the Bureau, and Xu Xueyu, General Manager, personally hosted the event. The wheel is scheduled to sail on the Shanghai-Ningbo Qian line starting today, departing from Shanghai to Ningbo every Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday, and departing from Ningbo to Shanghai every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, coinciding with the original Jiangya wheel's departure from Shanghai and Ningbo on the same day. The wheel was built in 1940 at the Tsurumi Shipyard in Japan. After Japan surrendered, it was taken over by the China Merchants Bureau. It has a total tonnage of 3,724 tons, a speed of 13 miles per hour, a horsepower of 2,500, a length of 309 feet and 2 inches, a width of 47 feet and 7 inches, a depth of 14 feet and 10 inches, a draft of 12 feet and 5 inches, and a passenger capacity of 1,180 people.</p>
<h3>Five Trolleybus Lines Increase by an Average of Ten Vehicles</h3>
<p>The British-owned Tram Company in this city has recently shipped a large number of trolleybus rubber tires and various parts from the United Kingdom. Therefore, it is currently working hard to assemble them. Moreover, starting from the 3rd, the trolleybuses on the 14th, 16th, 17th, 20th, and 24th lines in the city have been increased by an average of ten vehicles per line. The degree of passenger congestion can often be reduced from now on.</p>
<h3>Trafficking Morphine: Four Key Criminals Caught at the Da Shanghai Hotel, Secret Compartment Discovered in Suitcase</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Last month, on the evening of the 28th, Zhou, the Chief of the Jing'an Temple Police Station, received a tip that a large amount of morphine had been shipped from Tianjin to Shanghai. All the drug traffickers were hiding in Room 319 of the Da Shanghai Hotel on Tianjin Road. At about 11:00 PM, he ordered Zhang Tiansu, the Chief of the Criminal Investigation Section, to lead a number of police officers to the address. Three key criminals were arrested on the spot: Ma Qingtong, 27 years old, Luo Qiubo, 26 years old, and Luo Jianhao, 30 years old, all from Guangdong. After being taken to the station for questioning, they confessed that all the morphine was hidden in a suitcase at No. 12 Sanduoli, Daji Road, Chongshi. The person in charge then rushed to the location and found three pounds of morphine in the hidden bottom of an 18-inch suitcase. They further confessed that their accomplice Wang Chunfu was hiding in Room 225 of the Da Shanghai Hotel. He was also arrested, and a large suitcase was confiscated. It was an empty box, with mechanisms on both sides and the bottom for concealing drugs. According to their confession, all the morphine they had transported had been sold out. They were all taken to the station for strict investigation. It is reported that the drug trafficking organization is very large and involves many criminals. The police station is working day and night to arrest them, and it is hoped that the truth will come out in the near future.</p>

<h3>Two American Professors Come to China to Promote Child Welfare</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The United China Relief Association held a reception for the press in this city at 4:00 PM yesterday on the third floor of the West YMCA to welcome Dr. W.C. Ryan and Dr. &amp; Mrs. Braest G. Osborne, who came to China from the United States. Dr. Ryan is the Director of the Education College of the University of North Carolina, and Dr. Osborne is a professor at the Teachers College of Columbia University, and his wife is a public health nurse. The mission of their visit to China is to promote China's welfare undertakings. The Osbornes are visiting China for the first time, while Dr. Ryan visited China in November of last year! He was in charge of relief work and left China in March of this year.</p>
<p>He is returning to prepare for the establishment of the China Child Welfare Association, which will be held in Shanghai from October 4th to 9th. Before and after the conference, they plan to go to Nanjing, Beiping, and other places to meet with local leaders in children's welfare undertakings to discuss further.</p>
<p>Dr. and Mrs. Osborne expressed their opinions on Chinese children as follows: Chinese children have the same mission as American children, and Chinese children should have the same future as American children, which will have a great impact on the entire world. Currently, their task is to improve the education of Chinese children. They also believe that the children's relief supplies organized by "One United" are of great significance, because the purpose of the United China Relief Association is to assist in building a new China, and children are the future masters of the new China. Therefore, how to enable them to receive reasonable training and become a complete person with working ability is a matter of urgency. They are very willing to do their best to promote it.</p>
<h3>Lie Detector: Police Bureau Purchases Equipment, Allocates Rong Desheng's Bonus</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Police Bureau has recently allocated a portion of the bonus presented by Mr. Rong Desheng to purchase criminal police equipment. Zhang Shi, the Director of the Criminal Department, has prepared a budget proposal, which has been approved by Director Xuan. The total amount is US$10,000. It is reported that one of the new equipment is a lie detector, which can immediately identify whether the confession is true when investigating a criminal case. It has been popular in Europe and the United States for a long time, but in China, only Chongqing and Nanjing have such equipment. The cost is more than US$800. Other items, such as wireless broadcasting machines, radios, and various special photographic materials, are urgently needed at present.</p>
<h3>Super Jumbo Jet: More Passengers, Higher Speed, First One to Arrive in Shanghai by the End of the Year, Longhua Airport to Build Runway, Realization of Pacific Line Expected</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The runway of Longhua Airport will soon be paved with cement. The runway is 6,000 feet long. The entire project requires 40 billion. The Ministry of Communications, the Municipal Government, the Central Aviation Corporation, and the Aviation Committee will discuss the construction. According to reliable sources, it may be completed before the end of this year.</p>
<p>To pave the runway, the Central and China Aviation Corporations will each invest 10 billion yuan. The plan of the two companies to use four-engine aircraft to open up the Pan-Pacific route will be realized in the future. The "Central" is currently ordering two super-empty aircraft from Boeing in the United States. The aircraft is the famous B29 jumbo jet. "China" is currently awaiting the arrival of the C54 transport aircraft ordered by the company, which is said to be first used for flights between Shanghai and Manila. However, both companies know that it will be difficult to compete with the American Pan-Pacific route in the future, and the low production of four-engine aircraft in the United States recently will increase the difficulty of the two companies.</p>
<p>Chen Wenkuan, Director of the Flight Division of the Central Company, said that the company's first super-empty new aircraft should arrive by the end of this year. The aircraft can carry 80 passengers on the Pacific route. If the route is shorter, it can be increased to about 100 people. Because of the pressure chamber equipment, it can fly extremely high, with a speed of 340 miles per hour.</p>
<p>Currently, the two companies' overseas routes only reach Hong Kong and Manila. They both have contracts with Philippine airlines, but only China is currently operating flights to the Philippines.</p>

<h3>Zhang Beisheng and Other Traitors Escorted from Suzhou Today</h3>
<p>[Report from our Suzhou office, 4th] The Suzhou High Court has scheduled the 8:50 AM express train to Shanghai on the 5th to transport forty convicted traitors to Shanghai. Chen Songnian, warden of the Third Prison of Jiangsu, and Xiang Jian, a recording officer, will lead the court police to escort the prisoners. They are expected to arrive at the North Station around 12:00 PM, after which they will be transferred to the Tilanqiao Prison for execution. Among them are the traitor Zhang Beisheng, the former head of civil affairs under the puppet Jiang regime, and Pan Hongqi, the former puppet county magistrate of Jiangdu. Traitors such as Chen Jun and Chen Min are not included in this group.</p>
<h3>Death Sentence for陣 Chunpu, a Key Figure in the Puppet Regime; Chen Jiufeng, a Puppet Baojia Committee Member, Testifies, Indicating that Several Senators Were Former Colleagues</h3>
<p>[Report from our office] Chen Chunpu, a relative of the traitor Wang Jingwei and a key figure in the puppet regime, was sentenced to death by the High Court yesterday afternoon. The main text of the judgment reads: "Chen Chunpu colluded with enemy countries and plotted to resist our country. He is sentenced to death and deprived of all civil rights for life. All his property, except for the necessary living expenses for his family, will be confiscated." Yesterday, Chen was wearing a gray serge long gown and rimless glasses. He feigned composure upon hearing the verdict and made no expression. He was escorted back to prison by the court police. Chen is 47 years old, from Xinhui, Guangdong Province, and a member of the Kuomintang. He held various positions in party and government organs for a long time. During the War of Resistance, when the traitor Wang colluded with the Japanese invaders and betrayed the country for peace, Chen left Chongqing ahead of Wang in December of the 27th year of the Republic. Later, when Wang and the Japanese invaders negotiated the "Basic Principles for Peace" in Shanghai and formed the puppet regime, Chen served as his personal secretary and followed him closely. In March of the 29th year, he became the Secretary-General of the puppet Executive Yuan, concurrently serving as the Deputy Secretary-General of the puppet Political Affairs Committee and an executive member and Deputy Secretary-General of the puppet Central Executive Committee. In October of the 31st year, he was transferred to the position of Minister of the puppet Ministry of Construction. In the 32nd year, he concurrently served as the Minister of the puppet Central Party Headquarters' Organization Department. In April of the 33rd year, he was transferred to the position of Governor of Guangdong Province and Pacification Commissioner, which he relinquished in February of the 34th year, when he became a member of the puppet National Government until the victory. After the victory, he was arrested and transferred to the High Procuratorate for investigation and prosecution.</p>
<p>In another case, the verdict for Jin Gengxin, an employee of the puppet police bureau suspected of being a traitor, was: "Improper jurisdiction. This is an ordinary criminal case and should be transferred to the local court for trial."</p>
<p>Chen Jiufeng, 40 years old, from Shangyu, Zhejiang Province, graduated from the Law Department of Great China University. He used to run a business in Shanghai. During the enemy's occupation, he served as the secretary of the "Shanghai Citizens' Joint Preparatory Committee" and the "General Director of the Shanghai Baojia Self-Government Preparatory Committee." After the victory, he was arrested and prosecuted by the High Procuratorate. The prosecutor's indictment accuses him of being responsible for compiling household registration and issuing citizen certificates, hindering the activities of patriotic elements and underground workers in Shanghai. Chen argued vehemently during his trial at the High Court yesterday, stating: "On February 14th of the 31st year, the Laozha District was blockaded by the enemy, causing a severe food shortage. The Baojia Self-Government Preparatory Committee was initiated and organized to alleviate such terror blockades. As a resident in the blockaded area, I participated because I was influenced by the environment and also wanted to relieve the suffering of the masses. However, the committee was a people's organization and not an affiliated agency of the puppet regime." The chairman of the "Baojia Self-Government Preparatory Committee" was Yuan Ludeng, and the vice-chairmen were Zhou Bangjun and Yu Hualong. Later, the chairman of the "Baojia Committee" was Ye Futun, and the vice-chairmen were Wang Boyuan and Wang Lianfang. The 20,000 Baojia chiefs at the time continued to serve after the victory. I have been in custody for a year, and I have not heard of any Baojia committee members being reported as traitors. I have only heard that someone has been elected as a municipal senator, and someone has been promoted to an official position. To my knowledge, many current municipal senators participated in this Baojia program in the past, such as Li Wenjie and Guo Linshuang, who were all members at the time. Guo Shun has even gone to the United States. Why am I the only one being detained and prosecuted? It's truly baffling. I absolutely do not believe I am guilty." Furthermore, Ke Pufu, the secretary of the White Russian Emigrants Association, was accused of colluding with the enemy military to harm the former chairmen of the association, Ivanov, and others, who were anti-Japanese. The defendant denied the charges. Both of these cases were concluded yesterday, with the verdict scheduled to be announced at 2:00 PM on the 11th of this month.</p>
<p>On the same day, the High Court investigated the case of Russian immigrant Wu'er Liule Heff, who was accused of serving as an intelligence agent for the enemy military radio station on Jing'an Temple Road, and the cases of overseas Chinese Zhang Yichang, who conducted investigations for the enemy in Manila, Philippines, and Fu Guangyao, who supplied materials to the enemy. The hearing of these cases was postponed.</p>

<h3>The Case of Tang Shoumin Remanded for Retrial</h3>
<p>[Report from our Nanjing office, 4th] The case of Tang Shoumin, the former director-general of the puppet National Commercial Control Association, who was previously sentenced to life imprisonment by the Shanghai High Court, was appealed to the Higher Court for review. It has now been learned that the case has been remanded for retrial by the Supreme Court.</p>
<h3>Wan Molin Expected to Be Released on Bail</h3>
<p>[Report from our office] After Wan Molin was detained, his old illness recurred and has become increasingly serious in recent days. His family had requested bail, promising that he would be available whenever summoned. The authorities in charge considered the matter to be of great importance and telegraphed Chairman Chiang for instructions. It is now rumored that the central government has approved bail, but the formalities still need to be completed.</p>
<h3>Zhang Zi's Suspected Embezzlement Cleared by Investigation Team</h3>
<p>The investigation team for the receipt and disposal of enemy and puppet materials in the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui region previously received a confidential report alleging embezzlement in the return of the China Woolen Factory by the Economic Ministry's special envoy's office. It is learned that Commissioners Wu Wangji and Zhang Qingzhen have repeatedly investigated the office in detail and believe that the original confidential report alleging that Special Envoy Zhang Zi embezzled 1,000 taels of gold is not true and is impossible.</p>
<p>After hearing the testimony of Oppen, the defendant's lawyer immediately sought to prove that his words were not credible and presented evidence showing that Oppen had been deported from Austria in 1936 for drug trafficking. They claimed that Oppen served in the US military's anti-malaria team, injecting DDT in the Jiangwan dormitory, until the US military arrested him. Afterwards, he was employed by the US Navy and participated in the investigation of the Merlini case.</p>
<p>The second witness called during yesterday's trial was Lieutenant Colonel Taniguchi, the former director of the reporting department of the Japanese military headquarters in Shanghai. He was recently escorted to Shanghai from Japan. During his testimony, he stated that after Germany surrendered, he had contact with the defendants in this case, O'Hare, Lee Rantan, and Habenicherand.</p>
<h3>Robbery on North Shanxi Road</h3>
<p>[Report from our office] A candy store at No. 237, North Shanxi Road, was scheduled to open within days. The owner, Ma Jialiang, was attacked last night around 9:00 PM by seven robbers, one of whom carried a handgun. More than ten silk streamers that were hung up, 150,000 legal tender, and clothing, coats, gold rings, and lockets were stolen. At the same time, two robbers went upstairs and robbed Mrs. Zhu He of two diamond rings and 500,000 legal tender before escaping.</p>
<h3>An Old Man Commits Suicide by Hanging on Zhoujiazui Road</h3>
<p>[Report from our office] Yesterday morning at dawn, an old man was found on the Shuimenting of Zhoujiazui Road, Xin Jian Road, Hongkou, with a rope around his neck, barely alive. At 8:30 AM, the Tilanqiao Police Station, after receiving a report, ordered police officer Li Shaotang to investigate. The old man was wearing a gray cloth short shirt, white cloth shorts, had a shaved head, was barefoot, stout, with a three-inch-long beard, and inch-long fingernails. He was about sixty years old. At the time, he was still barely breathing. He was sent to the Municipal Fifth Hospital for treatment, but died only an hour after arriving at the hospital. His family could not be found. According to the officer handling the case, the old man was definitely not strangled to death, as the rope marks were on the front of his neck, not the back. He appeared to be a refined person in life, who may have committed suicide by hanging after falling on hard times. It is believed that someone moved him to that location.</p>
<h3>Stevedores at Foreign Shipping Companies Go on Strike; Arbitration Remains Unresolved</h3>
<p>[Report from our office] Stevedores are demanding a wage increase from 4,000 to 6,000 yuan per shift. The Stevedore Guild negotiated with various foreign shipping companies without success, leading to a strike that began on the 2nd. The foreign companies have requested arbitration from the Social Affairs Bureau, but no resolution has been reached. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company originally planned to receive the Haihang輪, purchased from Canada, today, but due to the stevedore strike and the cargo not yet unloaded, the receipt has been postponed. It is understood that this strike is limited to foreign ships, and domestic ships have not been affected. However, according to sources from the workers' side, if a resolution is not reached soon, domestic ships may also be affected.</p>
<h3>Faces and Neon Lights Reflect Each Other's Redness; Bans Are Still Ignored</h3>
<p>[Report from our office] The Public Utilities Bureau has officially announced that all outdoor neon lights and decorative lights will be temporarily suspended from receiving electricity starting on October 1st. However, at night, neon lights still dazzle pedestrians, and illuminated billboards still blind people. It is understood that the Public Utilities Bureau has requested the assistance of the Police Bureau to enforce the ban and has instructed the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to inform the various commercial guilds to notify the shopkeepers in the city to comply. However, this is only a temporary measure to alleviate the city's electricity shortage and does not mean the removal of the neon lights and decorative lights installed in the shops, only a temporary suspension of their use. Many shopkeepers are not clear about the truth.</p>
<h3>US Military Tribunal Re-Examines German Intelligence Agent Case; Witness Oppen Testifies About Espionage Activities</h3>
<p>[Report from our office] The US military tribunal yesterday re-examined the suspected German intelligence agents for the second time. Witness Oppen stated that Shen Ke (another German war suspect who previously accused US reporter Randall of defamation) was ordered by the German intelligence agency O'Hare to try to get Oppen into the Chinese interior to spy on US military intelligence. When the war broke out, Oppen claimed to be an American citizen and was detained in the Pudong concentration camp by the Japanese army. Shen Ke contacted the Japanese military police and planned to have Oppen escape from the concentration camp and sneak into the interior as an American citizen to engage in espionage. However, this plan was never realized.</p>
<p>Oppen appeared weak, with a full head of white hair. He vividly recounted his past espionage activities in China under the orders of the O'Hare intelligence agency. He stated that the monk Zhao Kong (also known as Drewe District Lincoln) and the doctor Merlini, who practiced medicine in the city, were both spies, and Merlini was later assassinated by O'Hare's agents.</p>
<p>Oppen stated that the O'Hare agency's work continued as usual after Germany surrendered. He claimed that he met with another defendant in this case, Rudolph, on August 17th of last year, and Rudolph told him that the agency's activities had only ceased two days prior. The Nazi Germans in the city at the time were protected by Kanna, the leader of the city's secret police, who was one of Oppen's closest friends. Oppen identified the defendant Habenicherand as the second leader of the O'Hare agency, responsible for collecting military intelligence. Another defendant, Bechik, was not only an expert in microphotography (reducing photos to a very small size) but also able to forge various documents and had forged a certificate for Oppen as a doctor on a Portuguese ship.</p>
<p>When answering questions from the defendant's lawyer, Oppen stated that each member of the O'Hare agency had to swear an oath not to inquire about the affairs of other members.</p>
<p>Oppen stated that another defendant in this case, Mossburg, was the person who taught him espionage methods. Mossburg ordered him to "avoid lying as much as possible, especially about things that are easily proven to be false. This point is even more important."</p>
<h3>Disowning His Wife; Facing Each Other in Court; A Case of a "Wife of the War of Resistance"; Separated for Fifteen Years, Seeing Only the Newcomer's Smile, Not Hearing the Oldcomer's Tears; A Bound-Foot Wife Accuses an Aircraft Mechanic of Bigamy and Abandonment</h3>
<p>[Report from our office] The local court yesterday heard a bigamy case. The plaintiff was a middle-aged woman with bound feet, wearing a blue cloth short jacket and black cloth pants. The defendant was a Chinese Airlines mechanic in a khaki American-style air force uniform, looking heroic and high-spirited, like a flying general. A classic beauty and a modern hero faced each other in court. The plaintiff stated that her name was Zhou Qianyinxian, from Nantong, 36 years old. She entered the Zhou family in Haimen as a child bride at a young age. She married her husband, Zhou Zhongming, in the 19th year of the Republic and had a child who died after a few months. In the 20th year of the Republic, her husband left home to join the army and has been gone for fifteen years, without any news, abandoning her. Because she could not bear the abuse of her husband's parents, she came to Shanghai to work as a maid. Later, she learned that her husband was in Chongqing and that he had married another "Wife of the War of Resistance." She had once corresponded with him, but due to the dangerous mountains and rivers, she could not find her husband. After the victory, Zhou Zhongming came to Shanghai with his "Wife of the War of Resistance." After being informed by fellow villagers, she went to negotiate, but Zhou Zhongming not only refused to provide for her but also refused to recognize his former wife, abandoning her to marry another, which constituted bigamy. After Zhou Qianyinxian finished speaking, she presented a piece of evidence to the court, a letter from her husband, Zhou Zhongming, to his mother, which clearly showed that Zhou Qian was his wife. The defendant, Zhou Zhongming, stated that the plaintiff was his child bride and that they were not married, so although they had the name of husband and wife, they were not husband and wife in reality. The matter of having a child was baseless and fabricated. Since the court had a letter as evidence, the facts were clear, so it ordered a reconciliation outside of court first. If a reconciliation could not be reached, a retrial would be scheduled.</p>

<h3>Answering Readers' Legal Questions: Legal Full Rent Increase</h3>
<p>Chen Yihua asked: My relative, Ms. Wang, took back the house she had rented to Mr. Jia for her own use after the victory in Shanghai last year. However, Mr. Jia used the excuse that it was difficult to find a house and delayed the move. At that time, Mr. Jia still refused to delay the move due to the trouble of moving. Later, Mr. Jia claimed that if she wanted to take over the house, there was another place, and Ms. Wang was forced to take over a single two-story building from Mr. Jia for 40 taels of gold. Mr. Jia accompanied Ms. Wang to the real estate company to transfer the account, signed a six-month contract, and said that there would be no problem with the renewal when the contract expired. Unexpectedly, after the expiration in April of this year, when she went to the landlord to renew the contract, the landlord demanded a ten-fold increase in the rent. They have been in stalemate for two months, and it has not been resolved. Now my relative has come to Beijing, talking about the above situation, if she owes two months of rent, she will lose legal protection. Please write a letter to inquire about how to negotiate with the landlord?</p>
<p>[Answered by Lawyer Ya Xia] If the lease is for a fixed term, the lease relationship expires when the term expires. I will answer Ms. Wang in five points: (A) Mr. Jia should have expressed opposition to her continuing to use and profit from the leased property when the lease term expired. (B) Does the real estate company have any intention to object to her continuing to use the current house as a leased property? (C) According to the first paragraph and the first clause of Article 100 of the Land Law, "taking back the house for self-residence" is one of the situations where the house can be taken back. The method should be carried out. First, inform the lessee, and then demand surrender according to law. (D) The real estate company should be informed to collect the rent. If it is invalid, you can apply to the court to designate a deposit according to law. (E) The municipal authorities have standard regulations for house rent, which can be negotiated with the owner accordingly.</p>

<h3>Government Bonds Fluctuate</h3>
<p>Government bonds were initially strong and then leveled off. Speculative retail investors were active. The general trend was warm, stable, cold, and tired. The morning opening price of the Unified Class C bond was 1920 yuan. The high price once rose to 2060 yuan, before encountering pressure. Due to tight credit, many retail investors were forced to sell, and the price fell back to below 1900 yuan. As a result, it rose by 100 yuan compared to the previous close. The Unified Class E bond rose by 20 yuan, while Class A, B, and D bonds each fell by 30 yuan. Trading was still active, with a face value of about 4 million yuan.</p>
<h3>Foreign Stocks Also Fall Back</h3>
<p>Foreign stocks also saw selling pressure due to tight credit and declined. The steel industry was relatively deserted, with no changes. Ewo Cotton Mill, starting from 10,600 yuan, fell back to 9,500 yuan at the close, resulting in a decline. Compared to the previous close, only the steel industry was flat. British American Tobacco fell by 10%, and the shipping industry fell slightly. The rest fell by less than 5%.</p>
<h3>Gold and Dollar Lead to Rise in Yarn Prices; 20-Count Double Horse Reached Over 2.3 Million; Cotton Cloth Has Subsidy Fee, Market is Relatively Slack</h3>
<p>[Report from our office] The yarn market, after three consecutive days of decline, rose yesterday due to the impact of the US dollar and gold prices. Buyers actively absorbed heavy goods, and prices rose. 42-count Blue Phoenix rose again to 3.5 million yuan, and 20-count Double Horse opened at over 2.3 million yuan. The former rose by 200,000 yuan, and the latter also rose by over 100,000 yuan. Considering the recent trend, it was extremely sluggish. Although the underlying thinking was very firm, prices still fell, which was not without reason. This is why it rises immediately upon stimulation because the inventory is not abundant, and credit is very tight with high interest rates. Therefore, fellow traders would rather replenish goods at high prices than pad goods and pay interest, resulting in eating away their profits. Later, as the bulls took profits and left the market, it gradually declined again. At the close, it only reached 2.24 to 2.25 million, still up 70,000 from the previous day. Other brands also rose and fell with Double Horse. As a result, coarse yarn rose by about 50,000 to 70,000 yuan, and fine yarn rose by 100,000 yuan. The cloth market continued to be slack and showed no improvement. Prices also remained weak. Xin Yang He fine cloth was priced at 86,000 to 87,000 yuan, while Blue V-font fine twill cloth was even priced with a subsidy of 2,000 yuan on top of the weaving factory's price. This situation is actually due to the tightness of credit and the high prices. Therefore, fellow traders are unwilling to hoard goods beyond their capacity, which would only lead to losses. Four Gentlemen serge was priced at 94,000 yuan. The trading of woolen cloth and printed cloth was also not active.</p>
<h3>Hua Shares' Momentum Surges, Then Plummets in Late Trading</h3>
<p>Building upon the previous session's momentum, Hua shares were abuzz even before the market opened. Rumors circulated that Yong Yarn was trading as high as 8253, boosting investor sentiment significantly. At the opening, all stocks rose sharply. After the opening bell, aggressive buying pushed available shares to very low levels, further fueling the bullish sentiment. New buyers joined the fray, along with retail investors, and large institutional investors added fuel to the fire. Yong Yarn and Jingfu reached new highs, Xin Guang matched its previous high, and Meiya neared its peak. Qin Xing, while rising, did not reach a new high. Fifteen minutes later, the rally gradually lost steam as profit-taking sellers emerged, creating a softening effect. The market churned downwards, stabilizing only after 10:45 AM. Many retail investors then rushed to buy, but without substantial buying power. Despite the slight increase, buying interest remained low, and momentum failed to sustain. Furthermore, tight credit conditions and the fact that proceeds from today's sales would be available on Saturday, incentivized some to sell and cash out to avoid interest charges. The trading floor became more fluid, and most shares dipped below their opening prices, a negative sign. Only Qin Xing saw concerted buying interest from numbers 91, 152, and 198, indicating stability. After 11:30 AM, sellers aggressively sought buyers, but the overall trend had reversed, and the bullish camp collapsed. Panic gripped investors, and the decline intensified near midday. News that the gold market saw the central bank dump over 2,000 bars, further tightening credit, prompted widespread selling as a precautionary measure. By closing time, only Zhong Si maintained its high price, while the rest plunged to close at their lowest points. Compared to the previous session, Yong Yarn, Jingfu, and Qin Xing fell slightly, Meiya, Xin Guang, and Xin He dropped by half a percent. Zhong Fang and Huo Chai remained flat, while Datong, Rongfeng, Xin Ya, Li An, Wu He, and Nei Yi rose slightly. Tong Yi Company fell slightly, while Zhong Si, Hua Yuan, and Jing Lun rose by half a percent. Cement saw no trading. The total trading volume for all stocks reached 17.5 million shares. After-hours trading saw minimal changes, both positive and negative.</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn Allocation: Over 1,500 Units</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The Yarn Factory Joint Allocation Committee held its regular meeting yesterday afternoon to allocate yarn. They agreed to sell a standard quantity of 20-count cotton yarn: 719 units from private factories and 860.5 units from Fangjian (with some sources reporting 849 units). These were allocated based on a weighted assessment of the applications. The price for a 400-pound, 20-count standard unit remains at 1.55 million yuan. The next sales date is reportedly set for October 7th.</p>
<h3>China Farmers Bank Tea Loan Objective: Hoping to Export 20,000 Cases</h3>
<p>To develop foreign sales of Chinese tea, and assist tea merchants with refining and distribution, the China Farmers Bank has decided to provide an additional loan of 1 billion yuan. The loan is to be distributed by the Qimen, Tunxi, Wenzhou, and Shaoxing branches of the bank. 54 exporting firms are eligible. The bank will loan 50,000 yuan per case for refining raw tea and 10,000 yuan per case for transportation. This falls short of the 120,000 yuan per case requested by the tea merchants. With this loan, the China Farmers Bank hopes that the tea merchants will be able to export 20,000 cases. If the loan program performs well, an additional loan of 500 million yuan will be considered.

<h3>Special Import Permits: First Batch Limited to Year-End Imports; Second Batch Under Review; Central Bank Reaffirms Foreign Exchange Settlement Procedures</h3>
<p>Since the establishment of the Customs Import Management Office, the import quantities of five categories of specially permitted goods—vehicles, gasoline, tobacco leaves, films, and refined sugar—are to be applied for by importers quarterly, each period covering three months. Due to delays in the mandated implementation, only one application was processed this year, covering the first, second, and third quarters, ending in September. The second application, for the fourth quarter (October to December), closed at the end of August. It is understood that the import permits applied for by various importers are currently under review. The number of importing firms remains at over 180, and the import quantities will be handled according to the regulations of the Supreme Economic Council. Existing firms that have temporarily ceased operations may apply for reinstatement, and upon successful review and registration, will be eligible to apply for import quantities again. The first batch of approved import quantities must be imported by the end of the year. Failure to arrive before December will result in a reduction of the third import quantity or a suspension of business.</p>
<p>Regarding the items listed in Schedule A of the Provisional Measures for Import and Export Trade, which require an import license before import, the Central Bank, in Circular No. 56, notified all designated banks to reiterate the following two points regarding foreign exchange settlement procedures after the Import Management Office issues the import license:</p>
<p>1.  Foreign exchange settlement requires an irrevocable letter of credit or a purchase order, and the shipment of goods must occur within three months from the date of foreign exchange settlement.</p>
<p>2.  Alternatively, the applicant must possess full shipping documentation sufficient to prove that the goods have indeed arrived.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the amount of foreign exchange sold by designated banks under the above conditions must be clearly indicated on the import license.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] Regarding the import of trucks, the Central Bank, in Circular No. 57, notified all designated banks that foreign exchange settlement is prohibited without prior approval from the Central Bank.</p>

<h3>Under Strict Supervision, Japonica and Indica Rice Prices Slightly Rebound Yesterday; Raw Peanut Market Prices Continue to Decline</h3>
<p>The rice market saw balanced sales and distribution. Although production prices were high, sentiment weakened. New japonica rice continued to arrive, stabilizing the market and reducing prices by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Indica rice also rebounded slightly by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan, but due to the sharp decline in the price of Bai Yuan rice, customer interest remained low. Recently, the supply has tightened, causing prices to rebound by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. Yesterday, 800 bags of Taiwan rice were allocated, with prices remaining unchanged. Registered goods totaled over 7,000 *shi*. Wheat and Minyu continued to be distributed, maintaining market strength. Bran prices from Zhejiang halted, so no sales were conducted. Soybean prices from Shantou and Xiamen saw slight interest, with high-quality goods rising by 500 to 600 yuan. With a large quantity expected from the Northeast, the market is not expected to rise excessively. Broad bean supplies continued to decrease, with active and brisk trading, causing prices to rise by another 1,000 yuan. Yellow hemp prices declined for high and medium grades. Corn trends were firm. Red sorghum was stable. Raw peanut supplies surged, causing sluggish sales and a downward trend. New raw peanut prices dropped by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan, while old goods fell by 5,000 to 6,000 yuan.

<h3>US Dollar Grain Storage Bonds: Redemption Procedures Undetermined</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance issued US dollar grain storage bonds in Yunnan, Shanxi, and other provinces in December of the 31st year of the Republic (1942), totaling over US$10 million. These bonds were allocated to the Ministry of Food for the requisition of grain at the time and were issued through the China, Communications, Farmers, Central Trust, and Postal Remittances Bureaus. The bonds were issued in denominations of US$10, US$20, and US$30, with each US$5 converted at a rate of 100 Chinese national currency. All bonds matured on December 1st of last year. When bondholders attempted to redeem them at the issuing bureaus at that time, they were told that the Ministry of Finance had not yet allocated the funds, and redemption was temporarily suspended. This matter has continued for ten months. Recently, numerous bondholders have been going to the savings department of the Bank of China headquarters in this city to request redemption daily. The Bank of China authorities have repeatedly invited representatives from the other two banks and two bureaus to jointly discuss a solution, and have requested that the Ministry of Finance expedite the allocation of funds for redemption, but no response has been received. It is now known that the Ministry of Finance issued a reply to the Four-Bank Joint Office on July 30th, which was then forwarded to the banks and bureaus, stating: "The redemption of US dollar grain storage bonds has been submitted to the Executive Yuan for review and approval. Funds will be allocated for redemption immediately upon approval." However, since the banks and bureaus have not received the Executive Yuan's approval for redemption procedures after two months, they are finding it difficult to make payments.</p>

<h3>Traditional Chinese Medicine Is Weak and Cannot Recover; Lycium Supply Surges and Prices Plunge</h3>
<p>Since Guangbang ceased operations, the traditional Chinese medicine market has been quiet. Unexpectedly, the supply from various regions has increased dramatically, causing market conditions to plummet and remain weak. Last month, the supply of lycium berries was short, and customers, anticipating the upcoming sales season, stocked up heavily. New top-grade lycium berries reached a high price of 80,000 yuan. However, recently, the supply has also surged, and various parties have sufficient stock, leading to stagnation. Market conditions have deteriorated, with prices falling frequently and dramatically to around 30,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Business Briefs</h3>

<p>Timber: The market is firm and strong. Due to the rising US dollar, sentiment for foreign pine is high, and asking prices are increasing. Chinese fir continues to be strong, with prices for all grades remaining firm.</p>
<p>Hardware: All goods are very firm. Door locks and copper-plated locks are rising significantly. A continuous supply of emery cloth is arriving, causing slight weakness.</p>
<p>Tin Foil: Demand is high, and prices in Shaoxing are rising frequently, causing prices in Shanghai to increase accordingly. Furthermore, there is no news of export tax rebates, so the market is turning prosperous.</p>
<p>Tin: The price in Shaoxing, a major sales area, has recently turned sluggish. Shanghai is experiencing some price declines due to continued arrivals of goods.</p>
<h3>In Half a Month, Vulcanization Costs Doubled; Indanthrene Dye Reaches 25 Million</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The recent surge in vulcanization dye prices has been almost manic. Within half a month, US 693 has risen from 1.6 million to over 3.1 million, and NK has risen from 1.5 million to 3.2 million. The momentum is such that everyone is taking notice. Although the prices are now somewhat stable, stocks are scarce and very firm, threatening to surge again at any moment. Dye factories are hesitant to set dye prices. The reason for this originally came from the purchasing in Hankou and subsequently from the price increases by manipulators. In the past few days, the market has been chaotic, and merchants from other cities have been deterred because prices are too high, and sales would result in losses. Vulcanization alkali has also slightly improved, and the market is still within the 80,000 mark. Indanthrene Blue and Baosai Lin Blue are being quoted at 25 million, and the market is very competitive.</p>

<h3>Kunming Autumn Rhapsody</h3>
<p>— Kunming Air News on September 8th, Xu Ji</p>
<p>It is the end of the rainy season, a touch of sunshine. Intermittent drizzling rain sprays the ground wet. Of course, this is a minor inconvenience for pedestrians, but in terms of weather, it is very satisfying. There is wind, there is rain, and there is sunshine. How can you ask for that in the Beijing-Shanghai area?</p>
<p>Crossing the rainy season will be a series of fine days. Kunming's climate is indeed beyond reproach. May I ask, how many places in China can you sleep under a quilt on a hot day? After autumn comes, it is even colder in the early morning and evening. Ladies are already displaying their new clothes, lightly and ostentatiously, giving a hint to those without clothes, a bit of a threat. It is not yet clear, and more and more people are wearing new clothes. However, on the other side of the street, some people are pulling up their collars and thinking silently. What are they thinking about? They are thinking: "The whole family is in the west wind, and the cold clothes for September have not yet been cut!"</p>
<p>A Dance Ban Order Silences the Sounds of Demolition</p>
<p>Young masters and misses are really bored. Eleven dance halls have closed their doors all at once, and they have no place to stand. A waltz rings out from the loudspeaker on the street, and people will unconsciously flicker rhythmically on the cement sidewalk. Wild children stare blankly, only to suddenly remind people that there have long been no dance halls in Kunming!</p>
<p>Xiaodong Street and Taihe Street are lonely. The sound of demolition will no longer be heard on the streets, and occasionally a few South American tunes will be heard from the "Pika-Poka", but it will no longer be possible for the "dancing citizens" to let go of their steps without restraint. What has risen instead is singing, is vaudeville, but it is not as bewitching as the tango and the Langbai. "The voice is soft, the steps are charming..." How can that taste be relived! The appearance of amusement parks is only a transition. When people walk through Xiaodong Street, they can only look at the glass items displayed in the window, and there is nothing to see.</p>
<p>Kunming currently has twelve entertainment venues, but the population is still less than 300,000. Naturally, there are not few places to pass the time, but they are biased towards local pastimes, and not many people appreciate them after all. The vaudeville that focuses on fun is only a gift for the petty bourgeoisie. What about Peking opera? There are three in total. The "Golden Treasure Fan" and "Stone Monkey Born" of the Yunnan and Southwest gardens will be performed endlessly, and the few roles are always fixed. Naturally, movie theaters are considered the only place to pass the time.</p>
<p>However, misfortune seems to be closely following Kunming's entertainment. The dispute between the eight major companies and the theater over foreign films has always been unclear. The conditions on the company side are harsh enough, and with conflicting interests, it is naturally difficult to reach an agreement. After repeated stalemates, the outcome is unclear. In short, for two months, no leg dance could be seen in Kunming cinemas. Only the Republic, Eagle Lion, Soviet Union, India, and domestic film companies have found a way out.</p>
<p>Midnight Gunshots Sound: Driver Kills Master</p>
<p>The rainy season in the mountain city has not ended, and the news will not come to an end. The costume dramas "Peach Blossom Fan" and "Chen Yuanyuan" of the New China Drama Society are being staged enthusiastically. On the night of August 25th, when the show ended, gunshots were heard again at midnight. The driver of a sedan car injured the master's wife. The wife's name is Sun Duolan, a National Congress representative from Henan and the wife of Liu Shishang, the former Chief of Staff of the Forward Headquarters. Liu Zhihuan was also shot at the same time. Liu is from Sichuan and was a former Youth Corps cadre. Because both men and women are in "public office", there will naturally be a lot of speculation outside. Sun Duolan's residence is in Shangyuan, Daguan Road, in the suburbs, which is where the shooting occurred. A car suddenly stopped, and the driver said he was checking the fuel tank, but then gunshots rang out. The bullet hit the face. It entered from Liu Zhihuan's right cheek, and half of his tongue was gone. Sun Duolan was hit in the head by one bullet and in the left cheek by one bullet, a total of four bullets. The two shared the autumn equally, which is quite clever.</p>
<p>Liu Zhihuan had been on the battlefield after all. After being shot, he still had the courage to pounce on the murderer. He ran dozens of steps before finally collapsing. That night, both the male and female protagonists were carried into Kunhua Hospital. When the reporter ran over early the next morning, they were both bandaged and out of danger. The doctor did not allow us to talk much, and we still felt at a loss for a while. Fortunately, the murderer Li Heng was caught near the Sichuan-Yunnan Railway Station at 6:00 AM the next morning. Let's wait for the confession before describing the case.</p>
<p>The City Police Headquarters interrogated the case that day. The murderer Li Heng, 26 years old, is from Daming County, Hebei. He spoke generously and said bluntly: "Liu Zhihuan and the wife (referring to Sun Duolan, because Sun is the wife of her master, Chief of Staff Liu) have long had "dishonorable" behavior. I shot Liu Zhihuan just to be worthy of the Chief of Staff and to calm my heart. Now that the incident has occurred, even if I am shot, I am willing!" Then he was asked if anyone had instigated him? Li Heng's voice became brighter, "A hero does things like a hero, this matter is entirely my own idea, and there is no other instigation." Then he talked about the process and motive for the murder, "At 7:00 PM on the 25th, Liu Zhishen came to Shangyuan (Duolan's residence). The wife said that she was going to see a drama today and asked me to drive into the city. At that time, I couldn't stand their intimate appearance, but I finally forced myself to send them to the theater. I was so angry that after drinking ten glasses of wine and half a pound of beef, the intention to kill had arisen. I lay in the warehouse afterwards and waited until the end of the show. The scene in the car made me unable to stand it even more, so I drew my gun and shot. I didn't want to hurt the wife, but because I had drunk too much, I couldn't control myself."</p>
<p>After the case was questioned, it has not yet been decided how to deal with it, but the injuries of the male and female protagonists are almost healed.</p>
<h3>Mountain Colors and Lake Light in Autumn: Xizi Changes Clothes</h3>
<p>— Hangzhou News on September 30th, Special Correspondent Chu Yusheng</p>
<p>The water of West Lake is always like a pot of hot water, unable to escape the embrace of summer. It turns out that this year's autumn is late. Hangzhou's autumn fragrance (in the seventh month of the lunar calendar) has been affected, and there are fewer people "wanting to play" (Hangzhou slang for playing) in West Lake. On the riverside road, there are more beggars. The business of lakeside hotels and restaurants is not good.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the Zhejiang tidal bore on the tenth of the eighth lunar month attracted tourists from all directions to Hangzhou, but the weather was still very hot, and they left quickly after watching the tide.</p>
<p>In the past few days, the weather has gradually cooled. Xizi has already changed into autumn clothes. The willow branches on Bai Causeway and Su Causeway have changed from emerald green to dark green. In the inner West Lake, you can no longer see lotus flowers, only many lotus leaves, which are gradually aging. The osmanthus flowers in Manjuelong have also withered. Several maple leaves have begun their golden age. Late at night, there are not many people walking in Lakeside Park, and the boatmen have no energy to solicit customers. The cylindrical lamps in the park are not as brilliant as before.</p>
<p>Behind the Industry and Commerce is More Sadness</p>
<p>The things in the shops are really cheap. Just take stationery as an example, Parker ink only sells for 600 yuan a bottle, and those Minsheng-type inks have been eclipsed. Glass belts have long defeated leather belts, glass handbags were popular for a while, and all the shoe stores are having big sales, with leather handbags and belts especially cheap. Before the Mid-Autumn Festival, I heard that many large stores could not support themselves, but now they have finally supported themselves. Although they have supported themselves, they are still very sad behind the scenes. First, many specialties cannot be exported due to internal turmoil. Second, foreign goods are cheap and good, and Chinese goods are too expensive to compete. Third, labor is too expensive, and workers are clamoring for salary increases every day, and capital is in short supply. This is really the tragic situation of industry and commerce in Hangzhou today and cannot but be taken into account.</p>
<p>High Interest Loans Turn from Red to Remnants</p>
<p>Hangzhou's "high-interest loans" were once very popular. One or two cents is not uncommon. I know that several places borrow money from banks and then lend it out at high interest to maintain expenses. Little did they know that the people who were lent money at high interest rates were lending it out at even higher interest rates. Therefore, high-interest loans were oppressing the people heavily. Recently, many high-interest lenders have also run out of ways. First, because poor people cannot afford high-interest loans, it is better not to borrow them. Second, there is no guarantee for the future of the business, so why borrow high-interest loans. Third, people who hoard goods feel that there are no goods to hoard. Hoarding may result in losses due to the invasion of foreign goods, so they still do not hoard goods. Fourth, the new Yideng has appeared, and people who hoard rice should hurry up and throw it out. Fifth, the current prices are rising in an orderly manner, not jumping wildly. These many high-interest loans have run out of ways, so they break through the east and突 to the west, and販 some foreign goods to sell. As for investing in industry, high-interest lenders have not even dreamed of it.</p>
<p>Entertainment is Absurd, Donations and Taxes are Heavy</p>
<p>Several former dance halls were later changed to amusement parks, but although the business is good, the profits are still not good, so they want to resume dancing. Recently, I heard that there will be tea dance fundraising. I am afraid that with such "efforts", dance will always be restored one day. Before the dance is restored, the entertainment they organize includes the leg dancing of the pre-war Plum Blossom Dance Troupe type, the singing of the song "Peach Blossom River Dance Partner", the low-level humorous comedy, and the civilization drama style of who wins. This kind of entertainment, tea sells for two thousand yuan a cup, a bottle of not very good brand of soda, sells for two thousand two hundred a bottle. Like the Jin country, it is full every day. There are also movie theaters, many of which show relatively old movies. One theater that specializes in showing Chinese movies is still showing "Three Smiles" and other films. However, the theaters are full every day. A "big world" includes various types of entertainment. Last month, because the film in the movie theater burned, the audience was frightened and fled. The escalator collapsed, injuring many people. After a period of closure, it has now resumed business, and the business is still very good. However, according to people in many amusement parks, although the business is good, donations and taxes are heavy, and the cost is high, so there is not much benefit. In any case, from another perspective, "entertainment desert" is indeed a problem that deserves consideration in such a beautiful place as Hangzhou.</p>
<p>Vegetables Raise Their Prices High</p>
<p>Although autumn is cool, prices have not cooled down in the same way. Pork is already selling for two thousand yuan a catty, eggs sell for one hundred and fifty yuan each, vegetables are two hundred and fifty yuan a catty, bean sprouts also cost two hundred and fifty yuan a catty, and only fifteen white fruits cost one hundred yuan. One day, the police bureau drove away the vendors to rectify the city appearance, and many people selling vegetables carried their loads and fled. As a result, many families could not buy meat or vegetables that day. Hangzhou vegetables are expensive, and the reason is quite puzzling, because there are many vegetable gardens and farms near Hangzhou. Some say that labor is expensive, but why is labor expensive? Upper rice has dropped to 40,000 yuan a dan, and cheap cloth is also available. The housing in the countryside is not occupied by VIPs, so there is naturally no housing shortage. Some say that vegetables are expensive because of gold, but can our vegetables be compared with gold? In my opinion, vegetables are expensive due to the exploitation of middlemen. Many people who sell vegetables deliberately raise the price of vegetables.</p>
<p>In the fall, the Hangzhou Municipal Council had a storm because the speaker spoke for the traitor. As a result, the old speaker resigned, and a new speaker was elected. The Zhejiang Provincial Council focused on reducing the tax rate on land, which lasted for twenty days. The investigation team came and did not find any major cases.</p>
<p>Li Jishen, Shao Lizi, Yu Feipeng, and Xie Guansheng all came to Hangzhou in the fall. Yes, autumn is deep. Visiting Hangzhou and seeing Xizi's autumn clothes is the time!</p>
<h3>Autumn Breeze and Horse Hooves: Talking About Hong Kong</h3>
<p>— Hong Kong Airmail Report, September 29th, Special Correspondent Ling Fang</p>
<p>A few days ago, the Hong Kong Observatory hoisted the fifth hurricane signal of the year. The hurricane ultimately didn't strike, but it chased away the sweltering heat. Although theaters still display signs advertising air conditioning, some audience members waiting to enter are already wearing light gray or coffee-colored woolen coats. Although summer time hasn't changed yet, the morning light already brings a hint of chill, and the chrysanthemums on the balcony whisper: Autumn has arrived.</p>
<p>Acquiring Famous Horses, Selling Lottery Tickets Extensively</p>
<p>The world of human affairs seems to be changing in tandem with the natural world. Newspaper headlines loudly proclaim two major pieces of news: Starting in October, the Star Ferry fares have been reduced. A monthly pass that cost ten dollars is now six dollars (before the war, it was three dollars). Electricity rates in Hong Kong have also been lowered, from a wartime surcharge of 260 percent to 200 percent. In real terms, this means that the price per unit of electricity has dropped from 58 cents to 48 cents. People are breathing a sigh of relief under the burden of life, but their common interest seems to be focused on another goal: The autumn lottery will soon be drawn!</p>
<p>Batches of Australian horses are being shipped in by ocean liners, their hooves already echoing in Happy Valley. There's no "horse racing ban" here. Under the auspices of the Army Department Relief Fund, the directors of the Jockey Club are sparing no effort to acquire famous horses, and wealthy "taipans" are hiring jockeys far and wide. Everyone wants to get rich, so they're selling lottery tickets extensively. Unlike the spring's Grand Champagne Lottery, where the top prize could reach 250,000 dollars, this time the scale is smaller, with a maximum of only a few tens of thousands of dollars. But a few tens of thousands is enough to spend lavishly. People eager to get rich are running up the twenty or thirty stone steps to the Jockey Club office on the second floor of the Exchange Building, nervously handing over money, and gleefully exchanging it for lottery tickets. On the afternoon of the 29th, Hong Kong will gain another small fortune! "The spring breeze feels delightful as the horse gallops," and the autumn breeze is no different!</p>
<p>September Clothes: Unable to Afford Tailoring</p>
<p>People can't talk about three sentences without mentioning "September clothes." Second-hand Western suits in decent condition are priced at over 120 dollars, but that 120 dollars is only enough to pay for the tailoring of a suit at a third-rate Western-style tailor shop. Better tailoring costs over 180 dollars per suit. Australian wool fabrics cost 150 to 200 dollars per suit, while British fabrics cost at least twice that. The tailoring cost of a suit is almost equivalent to a worker's monthly salary. Everyone has only one thought: Just wear last year's worn-out clothes!</p>
<p>The Hong Kong government doesn't seem to be deliberately joking with the overseas Chinese, but just when most of them can't afford new clothes, it announced a price limit on ties: eight dollars per tie, devaluing the colorful American ties by more than half. Why not announce price limits on wool fabrics and tailoring? A month or so ago, the Hong Kong government announced the control of piece goods, obtaining 20,000 bolts of woolen and cotton cloth from importers. It was announced at the time that they would be allocated to citizens at public prices. Those woolen and cotton cloths are probably still in government warehouses. Under the interests of the Sterling bloc, it is said that Australian and British woolen fabrics still have to be freely purchased by merchants for sale in Hong Kong. The so-called control is actually only on American woolen fabrics.</p>
<p>Price Index: Continuously Rising</p>
<p>The Hong Kong Customs and Excise Department today released wholesale price indices for recent years, stating that the current wholesale price index is eight times higher than the pre-war average. The statistics assume that the index for 1938 was 100. Compared with the first half of this year, the average food price is 768.6 higher, metals and minerals are 308.2 higher, textiles are 818.8 higher, and other miscellaneous items are 718.9 higher. The retail price index in the market is likely to be even higher. Taking food prices as an example: Food prices once trended upward with the arrival of the Mid-Autumn Festival, but after the Mid-Autumn Festival, except for the prices of chickens, ducks, and livestock, they didn't fall back much. According to official statistics on September 22:</p>
<p>(1) Beef: 2.8 dollars (per catty), (2) Pork: 3.8 dollars, (3) Salted fish: 3.2 dollars, (4) Lobster: 4 dollars, (5) Potatoes: 70 cents, (6) Eggs: 35 cents, (7) Peanut oil: 2.4 dollars, (8) Top-quality white rice: 1.3 dollars, (9) Cabbage: 1 dollar.</p>
<p>The official estimate of a worker's weekly food expenses has reached 14 dollars, or one dollar per meal, equivalent to about 750 national currency units—wouldn't it be cheaper than a set meal in Shanghai?</p>
<p>This reporter dares not assert that the cost of living in Hong Kong is higher than in Shanghai, but at least it wouldn't be lower, right? Cantonese people like to eat, and they go to tea houses for dim sum two or three times a day, or at least once. Recently, the business income of restaurants and tea rooms in Hong Kong, according to unofficial estimates, has decreased by half compared to two months ago. According to the owner of a large tea room who told this reporter, due to the recent sluggishness of various businesses and the high cost of living, the spending power of most people in society has sharply declined. In the past, three or four people would go to a tea house and the bill would be at least ten or eight dollars, but now it's down to five or six dollars. Although the number of tea drinkers hasn't decreased, the tea room's income is much lower than before!</p>
<p>Corruption Rampant, Actions Public</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, the Hong Kong Chinese newspapers published a message in the most prominent position:</p>
<p>"British Government Pays Attention to the Administration of Hong Kong</p>
<p>Sending Personnel to Investigate Government Administration"</p>
<p>As early as August 26 (a month before the news leaked), the British Colonial Office had already dispatched two Chinese and Western officials to begin investigating the Hong Kong Customs and Excise Department, moving relevant documents from the department to the Police Headquarters for review. This is a case of "smuggling" similar to violating the Hong Kong government's control treaties. "More than 200 related merchants are involved, and the person in charge has sent personnel to search the relevant Chinese and Western merchants, and the export permits and related documents have also been retrieved to the police station for review." This is a case "rare in a hundred years," and "the British Colonial Office sending personnel to investigate is also a record in Hong Kong's history." The merchants who have been searched are mostly transportation companies and shipping companies. It is said that those involved include some senior officials of relevant agencies. Because the Hong Kong government has not yet completed the investigation, it has no intention of immediately publicly announcing the details of the case, but the relevant parties inadvertently leaked it. The Hong Kong government spokesman did not deny it, but said, "If such rumors are true, then it is 'very good news'."</p>
<p>The Industrial and Commercial Evening News commented: "The atmosphere of corruption in Hong Kong is generally not weaker than in the mainland, but because of various legal covers and the more orderly handling of affairs, even if there are errors, it is easy to escape the eyes and ears of people..." In the post-war situation of "fishing in troubled waters," the atmosphere of corruption in Hong Kong has become even more rampant, to the point where it is "uncoverable" and "inescapable." The Hong Kong government agencies listed in the investigation list may not be just the Customs and Excise Department! The Industrial and Commercial Evening News also said: "When Hong Kong had not fallen into enemy hands (referring to the Japanese), the corruption of the bureaucracy was well known. Police detectives accepted bribes everywhere, covered up prostitution and gambling, did everything. Even street vendors, one dollar and a half, were all looted. Other agencies, if residents had requests, mostly determined whether they were feasible and how quickly and in what order based on personal relations and bribes. The most obvious thing was the problem of immigration certificates and the issuance of export permits when the war was about to come, which was a source of great pain for Hong Kong residents at that time..."</p>
<p>Even the British-run DeChen Western News said: "Corruption has occurred from time to time among civil servants and government offices in Hong Kong, and it was discovered before 1941. Since the victory, the scale of corruption, the boldness of those who engage in corruption, and the fact that they actually act openly, are also unimaginable before the war..."</p>
<p>Now, after the war, and starting anew with the people, it is necessary to thoroughly rectify the bureaucracy in Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Autumn Typhoon</h3>
<p>— Kaohsiung Airmail Report, September 28th, Special Correspondent Jiang Muyun</p>
<p>After being swept by its special product, the typhoon, autumn in Taiwan has given the people of Taiwan province a disaster unprecedented in 35 years. Even the people of this province, who are used to welcoming typhoons, have been unable to overcome nature's challenge to mankind. This reporter happened to be traveling in the central and southern parts of the province and witnessed and experienced the disasters brought by the typhoon. It is enough to show that mankind has not yet controlled nature and the power of the changing seasons. For the victims, the reporters shed tears of sympathy again and lamented the violence of nature!</p>
<p>Tainan Plain: A Sight of Disaster Everywhere</p>
<p>This reporter felt like he was detained for a night in a Chiayi hostel. There were no lights, no fire, only the sound of wind and raindrops. This was the first time in half a year! On the 25th, the reporters braved the tail of the typhoon and took a truck to Tainan.</p>
<p>Because of a fault in the truss beam on the Kaohsiung line, the central traffic artery between Fanzi Tian and Shanhua, we had to take a freight truck south along the highway. We squeezed into a truck full of Shanghai textiles. Within fifteen minutes of leaving the city, we were subjected to heavy rain. The truck roof had no tarpaulin, and the twenty or so people huddled together were all drenched. The rain was still like pouring, and the wind blew away the straw hats of our fellow travelers. The temperature dropped significantly, and there was a chill.</p>
<p>Several sections of the highway were completely submerged in water. In some places, there were large holes on the sides of the cement bridges. In the distance, the sweet potato sprouts that were silted in the mud had withered and scorched. The bare stems of the ramie plants, like sugar cane, bent their waists in the same direction. The blood and sweat of the farmers in the sugar cane, rice, and potato fields were repaid to the natural storm without any compensation! This reporter thought of this year's crops, especially the sugar cane harvested in December. The increase in sugar production was clearly hit! Mango trees along the highway were knocked down. After the car had been driving for a while, the driver had to get out of the car to clear the road. In the wilderness, there were several shepherds wearing straw raincoats and hats and farmers with hoes on their shoulders, as well as people rejoicing in catching fish, decorating the small scenes of the disaster area. This reporter did not miss these Jiangnan-like scenery, but was concerned about how the people whose farmhouses and factory houses had collapsed were coping with the unfortunate days brought by the old god? This aroused the reporter's resonance.</p>
<p>The wind gradually weakened. The wind blowing in our faces had a bit of heat in the coldness. This reporter had already tasted the southern part of Taiwan Province, which is a tropical region. The green cars of the post office were carrying workers to repair the broken lines of the power poles. The power company was also driving yellow trucks along the road looking for the places that had been destroyed. The wind disaster only gave people the task of quickly restoring things and quickly maintaining the original state!</p>
<p>What used to be an hour's drive took four and a half hours. This reporter arrived at the long-awaited ancient city of Tainan. The city's dilapidation and the traces of wartime disasters were everywhere. There was no electricity, no electric lights, no telephone, no water, and even water for washing clothes and hands became a problem. The darkness and desolation of Tainan made people feel even more that this was a veritable dead city!</p>

<h3>Autumn in Lanzhou</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Bingzi, September 10th, from Lanzhou</p>
<p>Autumn is cool, and the northwest of the Loess Plateau is particularly cool earlier, and Lanzhou is naturally no exception. Whenever there is a windy day, soil and sand slap your face, making you feel all the more desolate.</p>
<p>News from Xining is that the Qingxin Highway, which is under construction, has recently experienced extreme weather changes along the route, and there are swarms of mosquitoes, which have caused a large number of transport livestock to die, which has now affected the progress of the project.</p>
<p>Since the cool autumn, some rumors that make people's hearts hot have been constantly circulating here. Lanzhou has always had the most rumors, but this time the rumors are gradually approaching the truth. After the Communist army Li Xiannian's troops sneaked into southern Shaanxi, they had the intention of entering Gansu and passing through the Xilan Highway to rush to northern Shaanxi. Now, groups of people robbing the people have been found in Huating and Wei counties in Gansu Province. Each group is said to be no more than three or four hundred people. It is not yet clear whether they are Communist troops or bandits. It is said that the people are already full of hatred for these robbers.</p>
<p>The price of gold in various places continues to fall, but Lanzhou remains high, with ingots hovering between 240,000 and 50,000 per tael, which is closely related to the rumors circulating.</p>
<p>The "Wudu Ape-Man," which shocked China and abroad, is a major discovery by scientific workers in Gansu Province and may also become a major discovery in the world. A similar human skull discovered last time is still under careful study. Mr. Wang Yongyan, a researcher at the Gansu Science and Education Museum, will soon go to Wudu again to continue the excavation.</p>
<p>After the Longhai Railway between Xuzhou and Kaifeng was destroyed by the Communist army, wired telegrams from Shanghai to Lanzhou are also no longer possible. Telegrams sent from Lanzhou to Shanghai are sent by wireless radio, and the time for wireless radio communication is limited. Telegrams sent from Shanghai to Lanzhou may be received as late as two weeks later. The prices of various commodities in Lanzhou have also fluctuated greatly due to the closure of the road to Shanghai.</p>

<p>A burst of coolness, and the maple leaves suddenly turned red.</p>
<p>In places where skyscrapers block out the white clouds, Mid-Autumn is just a "festival checkpoint." Millions of people who toil all day long no longer have the leisure to fantasize.</p>

<p>The rotation of machines shattered the dream of the countryside, but hopefully these fragments of longing can bring moments of comfort to travelers!</p>

<h3>Reviving France</h3>
<p>— Shi Zhecun</p>
<p>A Translated Passage and a Postscript</p>
<p>The Work of Men of Letters Has Never Been Greater Than at This Time</p>
<p>At this time in which we live, we have only one thing to do; one unique thing. What is it?</p>
<p>Revive France.</p>
<p>Revive France. For whom? For France? No. For all the people of the world. It is not to re-ignite that torch for the sake of the torch.</p>
<p>People re-ignite that torch for those in the darkness, for those in the dungeon groping for the walls of that fatal obstacle; for those lacking guidance, light, warmth, courage, righteousness, purpose; for those who have a shadow in their future, in their work, in their conscience; for those who need a clear vision in their battles or victories. People re-ignite a torch, which is also for those who feel ignorant because they extinguished this torch.</p>
<p>But, to re-ignite that torch, to revive France, what method should be used? How should it be done?</p>
<p>This is certainly difficult, but also simple: We should make it emit light.</p>
<p>From where should it be emitted?</p>
<p>From the souls of the people.</p>
<p>Louis Aragon and Paul Éluard are two French poets who both belonged to the Surrealist movement before the war. After the fall of Paris, they both engaged in underground work, not only fulfilling their war resistance tasks in literature and art, but even becoming indispensable figures in organizing the masses and training the underground army. This may seem a bit unimaginable in the Chinese literary world, because Chinese scholars have always regarded Surrealism as a passive, anesthetizing, and imaginative literary movement, without knowing that its starting point was originally to resist tradition and resist restraint, and from this to obtain the result of resisting Fascism.</p>
<p>Yesterday, a friend in France sent me a magazine of poetry and prose. The magazine is named "Eternal Review." It is a beautiful magazine that was secretly published by Éluard during the war and is now being continued by Louis Barraut as the chief editor. This small magazine makes us feel that the French literary world is carrying out a very healthy restoration work. Looking back at our own literary publishing world, it is a bit suffocating.</p>
<p>This new issue No. 4 of "Eternal Review" publishes a short article written by the great French writer Victor Hugo in 1875 at the beginning of the volume. This short article is very interesting and can be regarded as a declaration of French literary workers reorganizing after victory. I am very happy to translate it as above, and, let us change the words "France" to "Republic of China", shall we?</p>
<h3>Thoughts on Visiting the Exhibition of Calligraphy and Painting from Past Dynasties</h3>
<p>— Pan Boying</p>
<p>The China Cultural Relics Company recently held an exhibition of calligraphy and painting from past dynasties in Shanghai. This truly gives people the joy of "hearing a footstep in an empty valley"! Both times, I visited with an encouraging mood. Regarding artistic appreciation, if I were to talk about it, there would be too much to say, and it cannot be written in a hurry. I will wait for a day or two, when my mood is a little calmer, to contribute some superficial views on this point separately for the criticism of connoisseurs.</p>
<p>I think the Cultural Relics Company has already done a precious starting work. It has attracted attention to social perceptions, which is the greatest value and harvest. In today's world of continuous wars, this kind of effort is not only not "playing with things and losing one's ambition," nor is it "holding onto the remnants and guarding the shortcomings," but it contains the spirit of "collecting the fallen threads everywhere" and "publicizing the secluded and subtle."</p>
<p>When the country is unstable and society is poor, a group of people always think that cultural undertakings are money-losing things and are not urgent tasks, and no one is willing to work hard on them. Indeed, cultural undertakings, in their entirety, are money-losing, and must lose money. But with regard to the small part of calligraphy and painting, it is not necessarily a money-losing thing, and can even make money. If it is managed properly, it is a very stable and profitable business. Therefore, those who do this work should not be afraid of losing money and not being able to support it. As long as you work hard on a career, you will definitely make money. These words may sound unrefined, but to really do it, you still have to start from here. However, "starting" is not "focusing." Our focus is still on the cultural effect. Earning some money is for maintaining and developing this career, which is fundamentally different from the merchant's "only profit is the goal." Only in this way can we not worry about things not being done, and can we achieve the purpose of cultural effect.</p>
<p>This matter should have been handled by the government. Since the government does not have time to do this, people without money have no power to do it, and people with money disdain to do it. Therefore, we are particularly delighted and hopeful for the Cultural Relics Company. From this point of view, I would like to express my hope for several things as follows.</p>
<p>First, I hope that this kind of exhibition can continue to be held more often. This time, it was exhibited in the clear and refreshing autumn, and it has already achieved good results. In the future, on good days in spring and autumn, good days and festive seasons, it can be held simultaneously in several places.</p>
<p>Second, I hope that the Cultural Relics Company will further develop its spirit of humility and responsibility and establish closer cooperation with various collectors. Credit is built up. This time, many collectors did not take out their masterpieces, which is understandable in the early stages of doing this. We want to say that such an achievement is already very difficult. Collectors have many good reasons for not easily showing their beloved calligraphy and paintings to others. We can work hard to overcome these difficulties to achieve greater success. In the future, collectors will have more guarantees and will be happy to send out their collections, which will definitely be more exciting.</p>
<p>Third, I hope that it will not only be satisfied with the exhibition, but also take a further step to do photography and printing work, so that famous works can be passed down. And can be passed down at a low price. (Low price and making money are not only not mutually exclusive, but also complement each other.)</p>
<p>Fourth, I hope to do more explanation and enlightenment work to arouse the general public's love and interest. Just hanging a painting on the wall is only loved by high-level connoisseurs. But if the author, era, and reasons why this painting is good are explained in detail, concisely, and simply, ordinary people will also love it. This kind of enlightenment work is very necessary. If this kind of work is successful, then the cultural goal and the money-making goal can be achieved in one fell swoop.</p>
<p>I have only hastily written down these few points as I felt them. Because of this, I also remembered the slogan shouted by the British during this war. When Britain was dazed by the German blitzkrieg, the British shouted the slogan "We learn from the enemy." In fact, everything in the world is a "teacher without constant form." "When three people are walking together, there must be one who can be my teacher." This is called "following the strengths of others." Regarding the reproduction and promotion of Chinese calligraphy and painting, we cannot erase the efforts of the Japanese. In their work, there are many laughable things, but their laughableness is enough to show their efforts. This deserves our vigilance and deserves our efforts. We should start from now on to do better than them!</p>
<h3>Compassionate Executioner</h3>
<p>— ·Qian Fanfu·</p>
<p>Ascending a few steps, I could already hear a burst of laughter upstairs. Reaching the second-floor parlor, I indeed saw Jinqiu and her siblings playfully fighting over a bag of peanuts. Beside Jinqiu sat an elderly woman, her face gaunt and silent.</p>
<p>Jinqiu immediately asked why I was so late. I casually explained that there were many people waiting for the bus, and it took a long time to squeeze onto the tram. Then, I gestured to ask her who the old woman beside her was. Jinqiu smiled. I didn't think she had any reason to smile, but Jinqiu stood up and said:</p>
<p>"You've come at the perfect time! This is Mrs. Huang, and this is Mr. Qian. Mrs. Huang wants to find someone to write a letter for her, so please, trouble you to do it."</p>
<p>Jingqiu—Jinqiu's younger sister—had already placed paper, brush, and ink on the table. I had no choice but to walk over and greet the old lady with a smile. What she wanted to write was a letter to her son. Based on her words, I recorded the following brief letter:</p>
<p>"To my son Zhanpeng: Your letters have become infrequent, which deeply worries me. Your mother is approaching the end of her life, and her physical strength is declining day by day. I am staying with your sister and brother-in-law, which is not a long-term solution. Are your endeavors outside going smoothly? You must promptly reply and tell me whether you plan to come to Shanghai for a reunion or have other plans! From your mother."</p>
<p>After finishing writing, I read it aloud to Mrs. Huang, and she nodded in satisfaction. As I sealed the letter for her, I suddenly noticed Jinqiu making a face at me from afar, suppressing her laughter. I felt that her behavior today was a bit abnormal.</p>
<p>Before Mrs. Huang took her leave, she didn't forget to thank me. Watching her gaunt back and faltering steps, I couldn't help but feel infinite sympathy for this wandering old woman.</p>
<p>As soon as the old lady left, we young adults felt as if a layer of constraint had been lifted. I began to question Jinqiu: "Just now—?"</p>
<p>"You made a fool of yourself and don't even know it."</p>
<p>I couldn't help but feel surprised:</p>
<p>"How did you see that I was a fool?"</p>
<p>"Because you just wrote a letter to someone who is already dead."</p>
<p>"Ah!" I exclaimed in astonishment after a long pause, "Dead person?"</p>
<p>Jinqiu poured me a cup of tea. While drinking, I listened attentively to her explanation.</p>
<p>It turned out that Mrs. Huang's family had been very wealthy. After her husband died, the situation gradually deteriorated. By the time Zhanpeng graduated from middle school, they could no longer afford to send him to college, so he took a job as a trainee at a bank to support himself and his family. He had been pampered since childhood and couldn't stand being wronged, so he often had disputes with his colleagues. Others held grudges and secretly plotted to frame him. One day, when he was assigned to collect debts, they deliberately altered the figures. When Huang Zhanpeng returned with the collected money, he submitted it for verification and found that one hundred yuan was missing. That was in the autumn of the twenty-sixth year [of the Republic], and one hundred yuan could buy ten shi of rice! Zhanpeng was unjustly accused, unable to defend himself, and had no way to make up the difference. The young man couldn't bear the humiliation and was afraid to face his mother, so he walked onto the rooftop amusement park of a large department store in a daze and jumped down, his brains splattered on the spot. However, three hours after his death, the bank had already confirmed that he had not cheated, but it was too late.</p>
<p>Speaking to this point, Jinqiu sighed and then told me: "His sister, upon receiving the tragic news, discussed it with her husband and decided that Mrs. Huang's constitution was weak and couldn't withstand the shock, so they hid the truth from her, falsely claiming that Zhanpeng had gone to collect debts in another city. Coincidentally, the war broke out, and transportation was disrupted, making communication impossible. To this day, the son who has been dead for nine years still lives in his mother's heart."</p>
<p>After Jinqiu finished speaking, a silence fell over the room.</p>
<p>I pondered for a while and then said to Jinqiu, "I think that avoiding temporary pain has instead caused this old woman endless long-term suffering—leaving a strand of undying hope that forever lurks in her life, tormenting her. In any case, it is a cruel thing."</p>
<p>"What do you think should be done?"</p>
<p>"Tell her the whole truth, so she can offset ten years of pain with one day of sadness."</p>
<p>However, when Jinqiu and I went to Zhanpeng's sister's house and presented our opinion to her, she politely declined. In the end, I did not become this "compassionate executioner."</p>

<p>In the Forest</p>
<p>In the forest, we walk...</p>
<p>Along the sloping path of the hillside, the trees densely present their individual postures, creating a green misty curtain that shields the sky.</p>
<p>We stroll, stepping on the shade of the trees, the straight trunks standing upright, like spires pointing to the azure sky. The downward-spreading foliage covers, like layers of roofs, and from the dense shade, the sunlight casts checkered shadows on the green grass...</p>
<p>"I yearn for a vast and deep forest!"</p>
<p>Every day, I come to this forest to let my lungs expand in the fresh coolness! And the green liquid waves of the forest are always surging continuously, continuously...</p>
<p>Thus, we hold hands, walking slowly in the forest, walking...</p>
<p>Prairie</p>
<p>Autumn, stopping at the prairie in Jiangnan.</p>
<p>In the wide embrace of the prairie, I picked a purple flower, containing the power of life,</p>
<p>Spreading and clustering flowers! Gently, vaguely blowing towards you, blowing towards the heart of the prairie.</p>
<p>Don't worry! I won't blow my unspeakable pain, endless longing, and the prairie dream you gave me into the depths of your life.</p>
<p>"Let the prairie chase, galloping across this green sea of grass!"</p>
<p>So, we lie down, letting the soul of life drift in the prairie dream...</p>
<p>Records of Seal Carvers in Sichuan</p>
<h3>Xiao Youyu</h3>
<p>— ·Gao Tianxin·</p>
<p>Before the war against Japan, General Wang Zhiyi of Sichuan flew to Beiping to bring Qi Baishi, known as Qishan Ren, to Sichuan and housed him in his mansion. For a time, Qi Baishi's seals were highly valued in Chengdu, becoming a popular topic of conversation. One day, a soldier came to Wang's mansion, claiming to want to see the old Mr. Qi. The guards, belittling him as a mere soldier, jokingly informed Qi Baishi. Qi Baishi was greatly surprised and invited him in. This soldier, upon meeting Qi Baishi, did not say a word but knelt down on both knees. Qi Baishi asked him why, and he replied that he had come specifically to learn seal carving. Mr. Qi Baishi was moved by the soldier's sincerity and readily agreed. Who was this soldier? It was Mr. Xiao Youyu. To this day, Mr. Xiao resides in the city of Xufu in Sichuan, and many seek his seal carvings. In my opinion, there are not many who have learned the single-knife white-text style of the old Mr. Qi as well as Mr. Xiao, because he truly carves with a single stroke, not with double strokes using a single knife. Here, I add a word superfluously: I heard that General Wang Zhiyi had all the seals carved by Mr. Qi ground away because many of them did not conform to the Six Scripts. I do not know if this is true?</p>
<h3>An Inch of Territory, an Inch of Blood 53</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>I saw the young leader jump out of the car, grabbing his pistol with one hand and making hand gestures with the other, his face turned towards the side of the mountain. In less than a second, the people from all three cars got out, each taking up a defensive position, running to where the leader was, forming an irregular skirmish line. Including the leader and the drivers, there were nine people, with three submachine guns and the rest having pistols or Mauser pistols. Seeing that it was only about half a kilometer from here to the radio station, I decided not to take the car and half-negotiated, half-informed Dingyuan, "I have to go down and take a look. Big brother, you wait in the car." I also said to the driver and the two comrades, "If you have any weapons, please give me one. This engineer, Wu, is a technician under Commander Feng, and he is just recovering from illness, so he should stay in the car. Please keep an eye..." They immediately gave me a German-made twelve-shot pistol, even detaching the magazine and handing it over.</p>
<p>At this time, the nine people in front had adopted a searching posture, encircling the earthen hill. I tightened the magazine, checked the pistol, released the safety, and chased after them. We searched to the top of the earthen hill, but we didn't see anyone or hear any gunshots. I felt a bit strange. The situation here was that to the east were continuous mountain ridges, and to the south, separated by a valley, was the entrance to the highway. Crossing over, there were more earthen ridges, rising and falling, stretching along. To the east was the town in the basin, and beyond that was the railway. Our radio station and the road bureau's power plant were all on the eastern slope of the opposite mountain ridge. Afraid that the leader was not familiar with the terrain here, I went over to him and said, "It's important that we cross over to the opposite mountain first. The radio station and the plant can be seen after crossing that small hill."</p>
<p>The leader agreed with my words, and we moved diagonally downwards towards the mountainside. Just as we reached halfway down, we spotted three or four people on the highway, running straight towards the town. Because it was already dusk, it was hard to see who they were, only knowing that they were not wearing military uniforms, but they all had weapons in their hands. As soon as the leader saw them, he made a hand gesture and quickened his pace, rushing down the mountain, crossing the highway, and ascending the opposite hillside. Because the highway curved south along the foot of the mountain, he didn't ask if there was a road but took the direct route in a triangular fashion, running diagonally, so he could intercept those guys head-on. As we ran, we didn't expect that those guys, for some reason, had also abandoned the highway, moving diagonally upwards towards the mountain, probably not noticing that we were rushing towards them.</p>
<p>"Stop, hey!" The leader shouted loudly at them, less than a hundred yards away, and fired two shots into the air. To those who understood military affairs, they were completely surrounded by us because our position was higher, the terrain was favorable, and we were downhill, with more people than them, like air combat, we had already controlled their blind spot. Logically, they should have laid down their weapons or immediately found terrain to hold out, hoping for reinforcements; if not, they should have fought to the death. Who knew that these guys had no military knowledge and refused to take either of the main roads? Hearing the gunshots, they looked back in surprise, but still ran forward desperately.</p>
<p>Bang! ... The first one in front fell down. This was our leader giving them a warning, because he still wanted to call them to stop and ask what was happening: maybe they were people from our side, maybe they were local self-defense forces. If they were enemies, they could be captured alive and questioned.</p>
<p>Who knew that the remaining three just threw away the weapons in their hands and still ran along the route. Seeing this situation, our leader was stunned, chasing while turning his head to ask me, "What's going on?" In other words, he was saying, why are those guys all amateurs?</p>

<h3>Chorus of Voices</h3>
<p>— Shaofu</p>
<p>The Chorus of Voices basketball team, after coming to Shanghai, won all eight of its games, creating a majestic momentum, shocking the Shanghai sports world and satisfying the basketball cravings of thousands of fans.</p>
<p>The times are merciless, especially in the sports world, which is the most cruel. To be honest, seniority cannot be sold on the court. If he was a star ten years ago, and he is still active ten years later, that only proves the lack of progress of later generations, because the crown on the court can only be maintained for ten years for one person.</p>
<p>Why? Because in addition to technique, abundant energy is the most basic condition. Today, if we still let someone over forty years old pant on the court, it seems a shame.</p>
<p>Many friends say that people who make a living by playing ball are almost in a position where they cannot stop, surrounded by people, with a sentimental attachment to their bones, so they have no choice but to disgrace themselves on the court in a contradictory state. Can there be anything more tragic than this in the world?</p>
<p>What the Chorus of Voices showed in Shanghai, I believe, is not their record of eight wins in eight games, but the truth they brought to us: If you want to progress, seize the times, and take life seriously.</p>
<p>In fact, not only is a basketball team like this, but in all things, can one be free from the constraints of these three factors?</p>
<h3>The Magnificent Rivers and Mountains Must Not Be Lost Again! Pay Attention to the South China Sea Islands</h3>
<p>— One</p>
<p>According to the Shen Bao of September 28th, the Executive Yuan ordered the Guangdong Provincial Government to take over the South China Sea Islands. The so-called South China Sea Islands, including the Dongsha Island, Xisha Islands, Nansha Islands, and Tuansha Islands, are all distributed in the southernmost South China Sea. A certain piece of history and the situation are quite worth discussing: These islands are like many pearls scattered in the South China Sea of China, emitting their brilliance and reflecting on the climate of the South, where it is summer all year round, exceptionally hot. The lowest, Louisa Reef, is at a latitude of about six degrees, close to British Borneo. Because they are located far away, most people have no impression of them.</p>
<p>Scenery of the Archipelago</p>
<p>Among the archipelagos, Dongsha Island is the closest to Guangdong Province, while the Xisha Islands are closer to Hainan Island. Dongsha Island is formed by sand accumulation. Fishermen from Guangdong often go there to fish. The island is equipped with a lighthouse and a meteorological station and is rich in trees, medicinal materials, and phosphate mines. The Xisha Islands are composed of more than ten islands of varying sizes. Previously, they were under the jurisdiction of Yaxian County, Hainan. Many Hainan fishermen come here to fish, because the shallow seas of the archipelago are rich in marine products such as abalone, sea cucumber, lithospermum, kelp, and hawksbill turtle. The phosphate mines are especially rich. Every night, the stars are scattered like chess pieces, and the phosphorescence shines in the sea, creating a beautiful scene. The Nansha Islands are all composed of coral reefs and are relatively desolate, but they are also rich in fishing and salt resources.</p>
<p>Japanese Invasion</p>
<p>There is more to say about the Tuansha Islands: the Tuansha Islands are southeast of the Xisha Islands. They are named so because they are all formed by sand accumulated in mounds. The distribution area is very wide, more than two hundred li from Hainan Island, but they have always been a fishing ground for fishermen from Yaxian, and the history is very long. Many of them are dangerous areas and important navigational hubs, so there is often a risk of running aground. In the seventeenth year of the Republic [1928], the Guangdong Provincial Government sent people to survey, with great intentions for development. Later, in the twenty-second year of the Republic [1933], France forcibly occupied nine small islands in the west with a fleet. When the war broke out, the Japanese immediately invaded and occupied them, claiming that they were discovered by Japanese people and renamed them the Shinnan Islands, under the jurisdiction of the Kaohsiung Prefecture of the Taiwan Governor-General's Office. For a time, land resources were greatly developed, and immigrants were added to the Xisha Islands, with the intention of permanently occupying them. The phosphate mines on the island have been mined and are now almost depleted! After the victory, the Taiwan Provincial Government sent personnel to take over as usual, and a sign was erected stating that the takeover by the Taiwan Provincial Administrative Chief Executive Office was completed. Apart from this, there were no inhabitants. The receiving personnel, upon arriving here, felt a sense of vastness, with wide seas and sparsely populated lands.</p>
<p>Someone Covets</p>
<p>This year, the Republic of the Philippines became newly independent. Seeing that our country did not care about the Tuansha Islands, they had the intention of invading and occupying them, including them within their national defense perimeter. These facts are absurd. It is sad that the newly independent Republic of the Philippines already has territorial ambitions! On the other hand, looking back at our country, our great rivers and mountains are not being taken care of. Now, hearing that the Executive Yuan has ordered the Guangdong Provincial Government to send personnel to take over is very gratifying! I wish them success! These archipelagos originally belonged to Hainan Island and were under the jurisdiction of Guangdong Province. If Hainan Island is established as a province in the future, it should be under the jurisdiction of Hainan, which is a certain principle.</p>
<p>Finally, the South China Sea Islands nominally belonged to our country before the war, but in reality, resources such as phosphate mines were secretly transported by the Japanese, and we were unaware. Now, we must not let these resources be given to others for nothing. We must know that in addition to the abundance of products in the South China Sea Islands, they are also greatly related to territorial boundaries and national defense. In the future, when our naval forces develop, these can be opened up as military ports, which will not only protect the motherland but also control the South China Sea. Therefore, their importance is not limited to the wealth of industry!</p>
<p>We cannot ignore the South China Sea Islands, nor can we abandon them. The beautiful rivers and mountains must not be lost again!</p>
<h3>Public Trial of Jeepka</h3>
<p>— Shen Lu</p>
<p>Time: Today this month</p>
<p>Location: Shanghai</p>
<p>Judge: "Defendant Jeepka and others, originally from the United States, since arriving in China, have relied on their strength and impulsiveness, disregarding discipline, and treating human lives as if they were grass. Their crimes are unforgivable. Now, the victims—plaintiffs ×××××××× and others—have filed a lawsuit, and the facts are clear. According to the law, they should be severely punished! (Slight pause) Do you have anything to say in your defense? You can speak now!"</p>
<p>Jeepka: (Rambling) "Your Honor, our cars are indeed from the United States, and each one is strong and robust. Our original service purpose was to help your country recover. Who knew that people would be fearful and become accustomed to it, not knowing how to give full play to our service abilities, but instead using us as a brand, only allowing people to follow us everywhere, and we never let anyone else! We are driven by our masters and have no choice. But because of this, we are known as 'Atomic Tigers,' bearing the blame for others. What else is there to say! But to accuse us of crimes is difficult to keep silent! I beg Your Honor to investigate carefully!..."</p>
<p>Scientific Knowledge</p>
<h3>Sunspots</h3>
<p>— He</p>
<p>According to a missing telegram published in the Shen Bao on September 24th, it was stated in parentheses that global radio communications were disrupted and cut off at the time due to sunspots. Sunspots, also known as solar blemishes, exist in great numbers on the sun as small, grayish-black spots. The so-called small spots are actually larger than our Earth, some even thirty or forty times the size of Earth, but they are still considered very small in the sun.</p>
<p>Sunspots are spiral-shaped, with a core in the center and metallic hot gas swirling around, truly resembling a huge whirlwind.</p>
<p>Why are sunspots slightly darker than the rest of the sun? This is a rather difficult question to answer. Some scientists say that it is because the gas emitted from the surrounding areas gradually cools, but this is not very reliable. In short, there are still many mysteries surrounding it, waiting to be solved in the future. The diameter of sunspots can be as large as forty or fifty thousand miles, but the ordinary ones are about ten or twenty thousand miles.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that the Earth has magnetic force, otherwise why would the compass always point south? But the sun also has magnetic force, and it is constantly changing. The sun often experiences magnetic storms, especially in the area of sunspots. Astronomers have measured that sometimes the storm of this magnetic force (the so-called magnetic storm) can be more than ten thousand times greater than the Earth's magnetic force. But to this day, it is still unknown whether this kind of magnetic storm occurs on the surface of the sun or inside the sun. However, within the scope of sunspots, there is intense swirling of charged material, resulting in constantly changing magnetic storms, like a generator.</p>
<p>Sunspots can generate magnetic force, so the magnetic attraction within the scope of sunspots is unimaginably strong. If you place iron tools such as knives, needles, saws, and hammers near sunspots, no matter how much force you use, you will not be able to separate them. But in reality, regardless of whether you can separate them, they will already be melted into white heat by their temperature, although the temperature of sunspots is slightly lower than other parts.</p>
<p>Near the Arctic, one can often see luminous bands of light coming out of the horizon, reflected in the dark long night, creating a spectacular sight. This is called the aurora borealis, also known as the Northern Lights. When the aurora borealis occurs, the magnetic storm of the sunspots and the compass both change with the size of the aurora borealis, indicating that there must be a close relationship between the three, and especially when the aurora borealis is discovered, the sunspots are very turbulent.</p>
<p>The magnetic storms of sunspots can hinder radio communications on our Earth, especially when they are agitated the most. The agitation time of sunspots is uncertain, and they are far from Earth, so Earth is not deeply burdened. If the Earth's satellite, the moon, also had magnetic storms like the sun, then the moon is closer to Earth and produces bursts of magnetic storms on Earth, which may hinder the communications of the radio on the entire Earth. Fortunately, the moon has no magnetism and does not generate magnetic storms. What about the sun? It is not always having powerful magnetic storms reaching the ground to hinder radio communications. So, the hindrance of radio communications by sunspots is not very common.</p>

<p>News within the News</p>
<p>Recently, a friend in America who works part-time as a reporter for a Shanghai newspaper wrote, "Foreign news agencies stationed in China often have one correspondent in one location, sending out dispatches from where they sit. But Chinese newspapers with relatively strong financial resources can only specially contract foreign reporters who have to run around to several places, rushing between major cities, causing them to be overwhelmed. This is not because the newspapers can't afford the money, but because it's not easy to buy foreign exchange in Shanghai. Occasionally, after many twists and turns, they manage to get approval to send some foreign exchange, but it's not even enough to pay for travel expenses." I heard that the overseas department of a Chinese-language party newspaper in New York hasn't seen a penny of subsidy since January, probably for the same reason. Of course, we can't just use these reasons to criticize several banks for their misguided approach to "dragging" and "shelving" foreign exchange applications from the news industry. But when we think about how some "inspection personnel" often bring their families and servants to foreign countries, lingering over cocktails and forgetting to return, and how many merchants are approved to consume large amounts of foreign exchange on the shipping and sale of glass products, we really can't help but feel sorry for the lagging state of the Chinese news industry!</p>
<p>Whose Fault Is It?</p>
<p>Since the Chorus of Voices basketball team came to Shanghai, they have won eight games in a row, especially the game last week when they overwhelmed Hua Lian with a score of 66:45. We saw the "embarrassment" of Li Zhenzhong, Bao Songqi, and Chen Xuechong, who were exhausted. We also saw a microcosm of the current corrupt society in Shanghai. We don't want to comment on the harm that this kind of society does to the private lives of successful players, but just looking at the current situation: Bao, Li, and others can be considered veteran players, but it is precisely because they are "old" that a society that worships heroism has promoted their arrogance and damaged their drive. The Chorus of Voices, with its lineup of young players, went north and defeated Hua Lian in one fell swoop, while Hua Lian was planning to send "veteran players" to the United States to study basketball. I am willing to provide this fact to those "old" seniors in society who consider themselves experienced and often treat young people with "what are you?" You have to take a closer look at us!</p>
<p>Common Sense, Common Sense!</p>
<p>A few days ago, the Tianjin Yi Shi Bao had a feature from Yinchuan, which included a passage: "...When he (probably a friend of the author) was studying at Nanjing ×× University, on the day of registration, he took his resume to the registration office to apply for a subsidy for students from the border region. The registrar, not knowing where Ningxia was, approved it for review. The gentleman disagreed and argued, alarming the director of the department, who eventually instructed, 'Ningxia belongs to the Northeast Provinces, he should be given it.'" It seems like a joke, but it is actually a painful lesson. Didn't many students also move the Himalayas to North Africa and have the Tarim River flow through Southern European countries into the Mediterranean Sea on the geography test questions of the joint entrance examination of Tsinghua and other three universities a few times ago? Taiwan and Changchun still have street names like "Cho" and "Bandichi." Don't talk about politics, economy, and culture. Just this little bit of human geography education should really make us think deeply and work hard in a concrete way!</p>
