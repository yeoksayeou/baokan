<h3>中美新商約內容　包括僑民通商航海設領　最惠國條欵以換文規定</h3>
<p>〔本報南京二日一電〕中美商約已經最後校閱，原定二日正式簽字，但以手續趕辦不及，改下週內簽字，聞內容至爲廣泛詳盡，凡普通商約應包括之事項，其中均有明確規定，其主要部份有甲，僑民享受之權利與自由，（一）入境，（二）居住，（三）旅行，（四）工作，（五）納稅，（六）兵役，（七）人身及財產之保障，（八）動產與不動產之買賣。乙，通商，（一）關稅，（二）附加稅，（三）內地稅，（四）營業執照，（五）貿易定額，（六）商業組織。丙，航海，（一）船舶之國籍，（二）噸位稅及港口稅，（三）港口設備之利用，（四）船舶貨物之轉口。丁，設領。</p>

<p>周逆佛海案審結　鞫訊六小時定七日宣判　　〔本報南京二日電〕周逆佛海二日再受審。淸晨起，朝天宮即熙來攘往，憲警力雜秩序，除持證者可入庭外，萬餘觀衆均集大成殿階下，自擴聲器中聆訊。八時零五分·周逆押到，身着窄條藕灰色几立丁夾袍，淡藍中式褲，灰襪，圓口皮鞋，坐候寨室讀報。九時，辯護律師章士釗·王善祥·楊嘉林連袂而至，九時開庭，直至下午三時始吿終結，定七日宣判。庭長嚴詞質詢　周逆猶不承認賣國做漢奸　　開庭後，審判長趙琛，偕庭長葛之聲，金善鼎及檢察官陳繩祖，女書記官黃前琚升堂，即將周逆提庭。首對其發行僞鈔，擾亂金融，抵制法幣，貶譭國家銀行，悔蔑中央政府諸罪行，就偽府文件及其個人言論，加以質詢。周逆啞口無言。繼對組織偽府，發表謬論，簽訂「中日基本條約」諸事，加以審訊，周逆略稱：「我們不是兒戲的組政府，是必有所得，必有其和才作的；附逆後，早知死路一條，死上不能再加死，決心爲國家人民作點事，被吿個人起初尙猶預，後來旣作了，對責任並不推諉，『中日基本條約』不負簽訂之責，但也曾考慮過，是不會影響國權的，僞府是僞的，條約自然也是假的，被吿決不是喪心病在，更不承認賣國做漢奸。」　　有利證件　　旋庭上就有利證件調查結果，一一加以寨問，周逆供稱：「僞府成立後看日人仍瘋在作戰，汪兆銘作了可憐的傀儡，知行爲錯誤，即思爲國立功。」其事實說明有杜月笙函證：周曾於民三十託李伯濤，段宏剛，請其轉請自首，馬元放函證：被捕後係周設法釋放，但稱：「放（馬氏）原不敢以個人之私，影響國家之公。」吳紹澍蔣伯誠函證：周曾設法協助掩護工作。吳開先函覆：被捕後周設法使渠覊押南京後，並設法釋放。李明揚函證：被俘後囚於滬石川中佐家巾，由周設法救出。顧祝同函證：周於三十三年秋，向前三戰區接洽聯絡反攻，日本投降後，協助接收工作屬實。陳寳驊函證：周曾掩護其工作，並請其携函致陳布雷，陳果夫，陳立夫，及邵力子四氏。軍統局文移，對其工作稱：「經程克祥，彭素聯絡，奉准運用以來，初無成績表現，後經本局多方加强運用，方漸對中央具有信心。」周對此極力答辯，謂：「奉戴故局長手書後，即積極帶罪立功，開始佈置，故乏成績，其後裝設電台於楊惺華及其本人私邸中，並掩護供給軍事經濟情報，實負命輸誠，軍統局如有話講，請傳訊程克祥。」　　兩面政策　　旋又對謀殺李士羣案件，加以描述後，庭上就各種僞方文件，指出其在所謂投誠後所作各種違法擾民，底毀政府之行爲，周逆或予奪理巧辯，或稱係工作必需之烟幕，並堅稱：不負淸鄕及對英美實戰之責。庭上責問：「你種種行爲，都可說是「兩面政策。」周忙答：「冒險不是兒戲，若仍可說是「兩面政策」，殊不心服。』庭上復責問：「你旣不怕死，何不在渝效力抗戰？」周頹然答「此乃最初錯誤之犧牲，實深悔恨，爲國家，連祖宗子孫的名譽都犧牲了，至今猶爲人稱作漢奸，縱死亦不甘心。」庭上再責問：「綜觀你的歷史，在廣州從共黨變成國民黨，在漢口又騎牆，到渝又赴滬作僞官，在偽府又　過來作特工，眞可說是「多才善變」周始低頭無言。渝警備司令　公館失竊　　貴重物品不翼而飛　　〔本報重慶二日電〕渝警備司令孫元良之上淸寺公館，於上月卅一日被竊皮箱兩只，及其他貴重物品多件。聞被竊之夜，孫司令夫人適因事下鄕，家中無人照料，遂爲宵小所乘。此案發生後，各界人士多以爲談話資料，均稱奇不置云。罪狀歸納四點　檢察官請予以最嚴厲判裁　　十一時一刻，王善祥律師起稱：「組織部軍統局尙有二復文未到，係關於與中統聯絡及自首者，是否即開始辯論？請酌。」庭諭：「此二事本院已間接得證，顧長官已有復文，勿庸再等，本案偵查完結，開始辯論。」首由陳檢察官依起訴書述其軍狀後，歸納爲四點：（一）周逆所稱組僞府報國利民，實係禍國殃民，違反國策之荒謬罪行；（二）自首條件不合法律規定；（三）作特工係反覆逢迎，投機取巧；（四）敵降後不逃，效力中央，係日暮途窮，冀以微功倖邀减刑。末稱：「被吿罪刑重大，本人代表國家人民，應請寨判長爲國家維紀網，爲民族存正氣，予以嚴厲判裁。」　　周逆答辯　　十一時四十分，周逆答辯極力，曲解其行爲，係爲人民减少痛苦，而對國家並無影響，且多方牽制敵人行動，協助抗戰有功，並强調其作特工之成績，及自首之經過，對庭上之「對其可原處，有利則只論政治不問法律，無利則只論法律不問政治，對其有功者有利，則只問動機不問行爲，無利則只問行爲不問動機，將其忠心勞績一筆抹煞，深表「遺憾」於此，庭上出示適纔接得之軍統局結束辦事處之復文，節稱：「所稱曾向中央自首一節，經查並無其事。」周聆悉後，倖倖然稱：「如此則無辦法！」　　律師辯詞　　鑼由章士釗辯護三點：（一）軍統局移文上之「奉准」字樣，包括准其自首，否則如休令其工作？（二）工作不力者係程克祥，渠現已被扣；（三）軍統旣命其工作，應信賞必罰。章並列舉史例多端，無非請求减輕罪刑。王善祥律師復引刑法第五十七條十款，「犯罪後之態度，如爲改悔者，應從輕判邪」。「請庭上依有理而確定之有利證據，爲减刑之處分，以昭信於方爲國家劫力之偽軍。」楊善霖律師則提出程克祥策反工作報吿抄本，呈庭稱：係被吿家屬交來，請求「量法衡情，减輕判刑。」　　斷章取義　　律師辯護畢，陳檢察官復就章士劍第一點加以辨正；移文偵查意見中原文是「奉准策動運用」，「奉准自首」，不能斷章取義。是後，寨判長復問周逆有何話說？周逆大叫「有話說，心情不好，不說了！」稍頃，復指法庭上對聯之下聯，大放厥詞：「明刑復恤刑」，殺人有什麼意思，死沒有關係，但不能一個人講意氣，有罪應判刑，有功也不應抹煞，除非是紂桀，秦始皇，才如此專斷，今後國家不免有內亂外患，如法律不辨，功罪走錯一步者，誰肯回頭？周逆復就菲律賓光復後之政情，對民主竟大加發揮，旁聽席上少數莫明其妙之聽衆，竟有爲之喊好鼓掌者。至二時三刻，庭錄讀畢，周逆簽押後，庭諭「本案辯論終結，定七日上午九時宣判」。　　活動無用　　至此，趙院長復莊戴詞稱：「最後本響判長有幾句話，被吿要聽好，家屬尤要聽好：最近聽說你的家屬用不少金條，多方奔走，這是無用的，希望不要以金錢活動，須知本院法官，乃是貧賤不能移，威武不能屈，財情不能動的，無論如何，決定公平判決，一切活動都是多餘的。」周逆連稱「無此事」。庭諭：「無此事就好，被吿還押」。此際三時正，枵腹之聽衆，始如退潮而散。偵查李逆惺華　周逆被傳作證　　〔中央社南京二日電〕首都高院今日下午四時開調查庭，特傳周逆佛海作體，一爲楊逆惺華案，曾供介紹彭壽爲周逆秘書以掩護其地下工作。周逆供稱：確有其事。一爲沈長賡控周逆主持僞證券交易所·有害人民，周逆對僞證券交易所營業有所辯述，五時十分訊　還押。錢逆稻孫　處刑十年　　〔中央社北平二日電〕僞北京大學校長錢稻孫，今日經冀高院判處有期徒刑十年，褫奪公權六年。台北白書刦案　匪犯全部落綱　　〔中央社台北一日電〕十月卅一日此間彰化銀行白畫被劫台幣三十萬元巨案，頃已於十小時內爲市警局破獲，匪犯五人，除匪首簡亮當塲格斃外，其餘悉數就擒。據供：七月間白畫路劫專卖局公款台幣十萬元一案，亦渠等所爲。行總上海分署　設工作計劃委會　分設三組辦理交通工業善後　　〔本市訊〕行總上海分署，爲推進上海善後工作，特召集比間各有關機稱，商討辦法，昨舉行首次會議，決定成立行總上海分署善後工作計劃委員會，由劉鴻生，王人麟，趙祖康，及聯總代表納士Nush等共同擬定委會規程，基要爲：（一）定名爲行政院善後救濟總署上海分署善後工作計劃委員會，附設於上海分署內·（二）設委負九人至十五人，由本市有關機關推派代表組織之，公用局一人至二人，工務局一人至二人，工業協會二人至三人，聯總辦事處一人至二人，上海分署三人至五人。（三）應辦善後工作分三大類：一，交通運輸善後之修橋，築路，建堤，擴充輪渡等工作屬之；二，工業善後，恢復，並擴充在戰時受損之公用事業及主要工廠等工作　之；三，農業善後，扶助農民，漁民，增加農產，漁產及改良種籽肥料·（四）分設徵詢，設計，分配三組。今日休會一天　全國商聯昨開大會　民族情緒充分發揮　湘代表動議制止日船入境　　〔本報南京二日電〕全國商聯會二日里九時二次大會，繼續聽各代表報吿。當睽違祖國十四年之東北代表，及遠離祖國五十一年之台灣代表登台報吿時，　亮掌聲，不斷自四角傳來，新疆，寗夏，等邊省，菲島，越南等僑胞報吿時，亦嬴得掌聲不少。會塲始終爲濃厚之團結空氣所瀰漫，民族情緒發揮至於頂點。常塲且有代表對東北台灣已重歸祖國，而香港至今迄未光復，要求採取行動者。湘代表臨時動議，對日船擅入滬港口事，請政府嚴予制止。直至下午，猶有土默特特別旗代表自綏遠趕到，一種大團結氣象，實爲若干年來所罕見。　　大會於下午一時許休會，下午分九組舉行寨查會，一組工商法令，二組工礦，三組商業，四組輸出貿易，五組金融，六組交通運輸，七組捐稅，八組工商組織，九組特種·三日休會一天，四日續開大會。　　東北代表　沉痛報吿　　黑龍江代表魯荀若，以無限沉痛之語調稱：東北安全後始足以談中國以至世界之安全，而目前東北局勢仍極危殆，九省二市巾，松江，合江，嫩江，黑龍江，興安，哈爾濱，大連迄未光復，同胞仍處水深火熟中，盼同胞能寄廣大同情，使不聊於生者，能早日安處，流離他鄕者能早歸故士。東北蘊藏極富，無論農林，鑛工，皆有無限發展前途，希望舉國上下，勿棄之不顧。　　遼寗代表李藻芳稱：不淪陷不知祖國可貴，東北陷敵十四年中，同胞爲抗敵而犧牲者數以萬計，願爲國人掉淚一述：現敵寇已降，然東北情勢仍難樂觀，東北有無限富源，僅瀋陽一地之烟囪，即密如樹林，目前因種種關係，毀者毀，爛者爛，可悲孰甚，此事不惟將　笑世界，且將爲日寇所竊笑，希望國人應知「東北存而後中國存」之意義，從事復興東北，與其至海外辦洋貨而自殺，不若興國貨而自救，而東北即爲復興最好基地。　　大連代表韓岡蘊，代表旅大一百八十萬同胞呼籲，勿忘淪陷五十二年之一塊大好士地。　　台省同胞　悲喜交集　　台灣代表黃媽典致詞稱：台胞於陷敵時期，先後曾革命十二次，多少人爲自由而擲共頭顱，所受痛苦難以盡述，現重吿光復，誠悲喜交集。台灣在國防上地位極重要，物產之富，亦足驚人，盼國八能重視台灣。自光復以來，因種種關係，生產减少，糖由每年一四二萬噸减至十萬噸，煤自每月卅萬噸降至十萬噸，有待努力之處尙多。　　菲越僑胞　深受壓迫　　一度爲日人逮捕之匪島僑商領袖薛芬士報吿稱：菲島先復後菲人民族情緒日高，排華之事亦層出不窮，僑胞雖有資產，亦無法從事工商業，而回國投資又感種種困難，盼幣制能早日穩定，經濟政策亦能早日確立，菲僑胞極樂於返國投資，此外日本投降後，其在南洋商塲皆喪失，此正我爭取國外市塲最好機會，盼能於日寇捲土重來前，從速注意及此，否則將感後悔莫及。　　越南代表陳肇其致詞謂：越南有僑胞六十萬人，在越工商界勢力極大，其所辦碾米廠等，亦皆爲越南最大者，惟在戰時損失慘重，戰後又因法越時起衝突，損失重大，於三次著各事件中·即有僑胞二百餘人被害，商舖四百餘家被毀，現法人排華變本加厲，虐待華僑事情，層出不窮，商店皆遭統制，即捐國回國救災亦所不許，最近僑胞擬遝米回國救濟，至今未能啓運，並募集八百萬越幣，亦無法匯歸。盼政府能直接向法政府要求迅速實行中法新的，並取銷一切統制。　　新疆希望　投資開發　　邊遠省份今日報吿者，有綏遠，寗夏，新疆等省代表·僉盼海內外工商界能投資與開發邊陲。新省代表周海東報吿稱：新疆僻處邊陲，經濟文化咸極落伍，一切皆滯留於中古的狀態，工商業皆極幼稚，主要原因爲交通不便，政治特殊，十二年中，商會會長八易其人，商業自難發展，自張主席執政后，人民始有一喘息機會，如停止征稅半年等，對商人皆有莫大利益，同時省與省間，區與區間，交通亦日見便利，商業乃日見繁榮，盼能本主席「建國基礎在西北」之指示，重視新省，更盼工商界能投資，共謀開發。　　此外，靑島，香港及渝，粵等代表，亦皆有精彩報吿·天津中紡轄廠　紗錠全部開足　　共達三十二萬餘錠　　〔中央社天津二日電〕中紡津分公司轄有七廠，共有紗錠卅二萬三千八百卅二錠，日人經營時期，曾開足廿餘萬錠，中紡接辦後，初期僅開三萬餘錠經十餘月來之努力，於主席壽辰，七廠全部紗錠已完全開足，不僅打破日人經營時代之紀錄，亦爲全國工業界之奇跡。經建協會開年會　翁文灝對當前經建指出三要點　幷建議闢舟山港及築京廈鐵道　　〔本報南京二日電〕中國經濟建設協會六屆年會，二日九時在京中行揭幕，到會員八十餘人，翁文灝，谷正綱等均出席。主席沈君怡，報吿成立簡史，及本屆年會旨趣。翁文灝致詞，對當前經建指出三要點（一）努力增加生產，减少通貨膨脹；（二）建議政府减運輸費，貼補煤業，减少外來油料消耗，使各貨成本降低；（三）目前最大危機在出口額銳减，應即增加土產生產量，政府大量收買，向國外銷傷，爭取國際地位。最後建議，改進國內外運輸宜闢舟山爲自由港，使與東南聯絡，築京厦鐵道，與東南通聲氣。次谷正綱致詞後，繼續會務報吿及討論中心問題，下午分別討論資金，貿易，工礦，公用制度，及日對華賠償專門問題等，均有良好結論。晚選舉，三日晨大會，復有綜合討論，會畢全體將作無錫之遊。長蘆鹽輸日　　已運往者六十萬担　尙有卅萬祖輸朝鮮　　〔本報天津二日電〕長蘆鹽管局自復員後，已有食鹽六十萬担輸往日本，最近即再有三十萬担運赴朝鮮。該局所轄鹽田，現共有四十萬餘畝，三十五年計產七百五十六萬担，除供民食外，若干化學工廠原料亦悉仰給於此，爲目前國內最大產鹽區。社論國際裁軍的再提出　　自史達林向美國聯合新聞社社長發表書而談話以來，由於措詞的溫和，一般人頗有以爲有了是項談話的發表，或可促進美蘇關係的調整。在他的書面答詞裏，史達林並不以爲美蘇關係日趨緊張，並且還表示蘇聯依舊有向美國貸款的意思。然而在另一方面，在紐約召開的聯合國大會席上，旣有白俄羅斯代表在大會席上指斥英美在海外的駐軍，又有莫洛托夫在大會的演說，對英美的措施，大加抨擊。在莫氏的演說裏，除了提出裁减軍備的問題外，對英國在印度的政策，荷蘭在荷印的政策，乃至聯合國對於原子能的管制，以及托治制度的　未建立，均有所指斥。這無異向西方國家投下了一個炸彈。倘使史達林的書面話能够引起美蘇關係調整有　的話，由於莫洛托夫演說的發表，却又展開了蘇聯與英美等西方國家的外交鬥爭。　　莫洛托夫演說的第一答復，就是美國代表奧斯汀的演說，其言曰：「莫洛托夫昨日之演說，對美國等之動機，似有不信任及誤解。余不信盟國間之相互指摘，能促進團結之賞現。」開宗明義，就率直地向莫洛托夫作了坦白的答復；可是在事實方面却對蘇聯所提的裁軍建議，作了更深一層的反建議。莫洛托夫在他的四點建議中，其第一點就是要求大會考慮一般裁軍的問題，而美國代表的反建議却比蘇聯的建議更進一層，主張於一般裁减軍備之外，還應該有確實有效的保證及國際調查軍備的辦法。在這個立塲下，美國代表支特了蘇聯的建議，但附加了軍備調查及共它保障辦法的反建議。凡此種種，在我們局外的人民看來，眞彷彿有點像以你自己的矛來攻你的盾一樣。　　裁兵間題的提出，倘使在企圖造成一種國際道義上的力量以减削別國的軍備，則鑒於已往的歷史，未必是爲和平的保障。美國代表奧斯汀看準了這點，首先予蘇聯的莫洛托夫以坦白的答復：「第一次大戰後，吾人之片面裁軍，實爲一種錯誤，吾人決不能使此一錯誤重見於今日。」這是美國代表奧斯汀的率直談吐。在事賞上，依據史達林的談話，蘇聯在歐洲各國派駐有六十師的軍隊；而所謂師，其所包容的人數估計亦不一律。據邱吉爾說，一般估計，認爲蘇聯在歐洲各國的武裝部隊當在二百萬以上，此外在蘇聯本國的軍隊還不知其詳。是則如果要裁减軍備，蘇聯本身就應該先有事實的表現。第一次世界大戰後關於裁軍的這幕悲喜劇，至今印象允新，誠如美代表奧斯汀所云：「吾人決不能使此錯誤重見於今日。」是則在贊成裁軍的建議以外，便不能不有調查及保證的辦法。　　在莫洛托夫的演說內，又提到像邱吉爾那探的「帝國主義者之羣」的陰謀作亂，破壞和平；這和史達林的書面談話裏所提到的相互呼應。邱吉爾是一個在野的人，他的任何言論自不能直接發生實際政治上的影響；而蘇聯的元首及其外交部長都一再加以　擊，這實在可以說是對邱吉爾的過分重視。無論他的政見如何，邱吉爾要不失爲一個具有實際經騐的老政治家，在這次第二次世界大戰中，他又與蘇聯尤其是史達林元首有密切的接觸。封於邱吉爾的抨擊，因之，實無異於對英美的抨擊。至於此外若原子能的管制問題，托治制度的建立問題，英美與蘇聯之間的距離也還是差得很遠。在聯合國會議上，却不期又有如外長會議及巴黎和會那樣格調的重演。這距離可以彌補嗎？抑或我們應該選這種局面爲續下去，使這距離愈來愈遠？爲了世界的和平，我們不能不以一切力量來彌補這距離。　　然而問題之最緊要的還是心理的改變，假如不從心理改起，一切努力終得徒勞。華萊土主張以「綏靖」來改變蘇聯的心；可是鑒於過去慘痛的歷史，我們豈能又以綏靖來改變一國的心？自從德日投降以來已經一年多了，而國際的形勢却還沒有和平的跡象，現在還祇有一種武裝的停戰。聯合國組織是維繫世界和平的希　，我們願能够在聯合國的機構下，有眞正的國際協調來　擊世界的和平。好燈光，好生活！　　光明是人人喜歡的；黑暗是個個厭恨的。光明是道德，黑暗是罪惡。光明有希望；黑暗是末日。　　電學老祖宗韋司丁霍斯（Westinghouse）和安迪生輩絞腦汁，費心力，試騐復試騐，才把黑夜弄成光明，我們中國人也坐享其成。這是應該五體投地的感佩他們，同時還該謝謝上帝賜給我們這份不勞而獲的福氣。　　然而我們太不爭氣，鬧了五十年的「維新」「革命」「西化」「建設」等等，直到如今，一脚踏進內地，却依然是高曾祖攷的生活。一到夜間，街上漆黑一團，伸手不見五指，室內一燈如豆，顧影生憐，簡直不像文明人的世界！　　現在事情越來越糟，日子愈過愈壞。本來光明的城市也退化到黑暗世界，堂堂的首都正在發電燈的癥疾，實行四天兩頭停電；人家給我們建設的上海市亦有缺電的恐慌，不但紅綠的霓虹燈開始禁止了，從本月份起，並且要強制一般市民用電燈也一概「打七折」了，又誰能保護將來不會輪流停電？看這一點燈光小事，我們內心疼痛，眞像兩面烤焦的燒餅。一個國家不怕有敵國外患，祇怕有敵國外患而不自振作。多少近代的國家都是從戰爭中建設起來。如今我們挨了別人的打後。總算打勝了，而戰後漫長的一年却建設不出什麼來，連燈光都依然要暗了下去，眞可歎啊！　　停電在戰時是無可奈何的不得已辦法，這是病態，難道這種病要或傳染病不成？從陪都已傳染到首都來了，也將傳染到上海市來了，誰敢保證將來不會　亂假似的蔓延？記得一七八〇年五月十九日晨，美國東部新英兩一帶忽然烏黑大暗，時至下午，黑色更深得像無星的夜牛，像一隻大而厚重的魔掌遮蓋着人們的眼睛，像墨水般的大海壓遍着人們的胸膛，引起了鉅大的恐懼，這天，習俗稱作「美國第一個黑暗的星期五」（Amerca'sFirst　Black　Friday），許多人跑到禮拜堂祈禱，承認他們有罪孽，乞求上帝寬恕。　　現在我們老百姓有什麼罪孽要受長期的「黑暗星期五」？缺電力爲的是缺煤，或是機器有問題。中國有的是煤，外國有的是機器，爲什麼硬要製造「人爲的」缺煤？「人爲的」缺機器？誰在起內亂？誰阻止了運煤遝機器的交通？誰又在統制了煤的運輸與買賣而不許大家爭往購運？誰造成了罪惡與黑暗？如魚游水，冷暖自知。　　原子時代裏，夜間如光天化日的表國，還有人在咀咒燈光不好以致牽累了生活不好。最近有二位作家納爾生（G.Nelson）和拉愛脫（H.Wright）爲燈光不如意而發牢騷。他們說人們忽視燈光「荷蘭隧道」的日光燈尙不理想，企岡省電力是天下最笨的事，因爲閱讀時將變慢，眼請易倦，虹膜初適應時放到最大的孔洞，而且產生了大量的綱膜液質，多麼的不衛生。道其（Dodge）工廠是製造B29式轟炸機的，廠中單單在裝備燈光上就化去二、七〇〇、〇〇〇元美金；假使生產的酬報不足以償還這個消耗的話；工廠主人怎肯化這筆大本錢？　　納拉兩氏主張用三式燈（Three　waylump），用有反射器的燈泡，幷推荐銀色和水晶式等燈以集中光綫。他們提倡冰箱內衣櫥內抽屜內甚至洗澡間的鏡子旁都要裝各式各樣的燈光。多數摩登的汽車，已在遮泥板上裝置燈光，照耀着發火　匙孔的部份，可是前後門的　匙孔無此裝備，他們還在發怨言呢。請回顧咱們國內，不免太相形見掘！　　有好燈光，才有好生活·工廠生產，商店賣買，家庭操作，學校作業，那一種活動不要光亮？就是談天說笑，歌唱遊戲，也不能在黑暗中像盲子似的摸索瞎話。只有樑上君子，「剝猪織」好漢，才歡迎　暗，才討厭光亮！時間快入初冬，不逞之徒　　欲試，停電之區或燈光暗淡的地方眞是他們的好機會，還有車輛　　，　出不窮，　黑道路原是不安全的主因之一。深　市政當局在我們血業　的士地上，把敵人炸蟬的烈燄，永變爲便利我們今後工　的光芒！三輪汽車　具有四項優點　明年可出千輛　　〔本報南京二日電〕交部公路局平津區汽車修配總廠，廠長饒競羣，二日招待記者，報吿國產三輪汽車製造經過稱：國人自設計與製造之三輪汽車，已於本年五月間世，此事動機係由於政府提倡廢除人力車所引起，其間經一二十次之試騐，二三十人之設計，經過並不似理想容易，目前完成者已有十輛，在京共四輛。此項汽車優點有四：（一）安全，（二）輕便，可坐五人，每小時高速可達六十三公里；（三）靈活，經八小時學習，即可駕駛；（四）經濟，蓬車價爲四百五十萬，每加倫可走四四公里半。該廠明年可出貨千另八十輛。報吿畢，請各記者試車。待改進之處雖多，但行動尙覺輕便。港警中踢死小販　我提出交涉　　穗記者會通電聲援　　〔中央社香港二日電〕關於小販王永祥被警蹴斃案，外部兩廣特派員公署港辦事處，已行文向港政府交涉，除要求懲兇撫卹外，並促注意保護華僑生命財產，保證以後不再有同樣事件發生。　　〔中央社一日廣州電〕穗市記者公會今開會，議決對港警踢斃小販王永祥案，通電全國一致聲援，並派員赴港慰問。克夫人昨飛抵平　　〔中央社北平二日電〕克利浦斯夫人等一行，今午由鄭飛抵平。下機後，接受獻花，並與歡迎者行園李主任夫人，孫長官夫人等握手後，即趨車入城，赴旅邸休息，夫人預定在平休息三日，於六日飛瀋。昆補給區司令部　槍决貪污犯兩名　　〔中央社昆明一日電〕聯勤總部第四補給區司令部，今日下午槍決貪汚犯兩名；（一）該部經理處少將處長吳及，卅六歲，遼寗人，定製軍服舞弊，並私賣軍布；（二）滇省營業管理所上校所長曹登朝，卅六歲，四川人，連練侵佔公物及自本年六月份起吞沒各校尉缺額四員，工役缺額廿名，經訊明屬實，依法判處死刑。要聞簡報　　本報南京電　海軍總部即成立新聞處，已派定沈遵晦任處長　　本報南京電　返國述職武官候　，曾慶集等，三日集會商本身業務問題最近將分別返任。　　本報漢口電　鄂省參議會補選第四屆參政員缺額一名，結果王孟隣當選。　　本報漢口電　前大冶縣長李澄中貪汚案，頃經武昌地院檢察官提起公訴。起訴書叙明該員貪汚數字在一億以上。　　保定電　冀省府再電請行政院，撥發急賑百億元，普遍救濟冀災民。</p>

<h3>起草國際貿易章　我代表提備忘錄　貿易限制等項須加以修正</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓一日電〕國際貿易及　　會議籌備會，現正在倫敦舉　，頃據美國務院發言人宣稱，　　會對於「國際貿易機構」總　之起草工作進展迅速，殊出　　之外。籌備會現已接受美國所　出之憲章草案，作爲討論之基礎，可望於十一月杪起草竣事，俾　交國際貿易與就業會議討論。</p>
<p>〔中央社倫敦一日專電〕中國代表團己向國際貿易就業會議籌委會提出備忘錄，提議將世界貿易憲章內美代表幽所提出有關貿易限制及關稅調整之數項案款，加以修正。該備忘錄謂，應免用不適當之量的限制，作爲調整貿易之手段，申國代表團認爲不能接受，僅以調整關稅率，即足以有助於工商業落後之國家之建議。備忘錄說明中國代表團之意見，所持理由爲：「關稅保護在未能充分獲致預期之結果前，已被認爲過高，此種行徑不僅違背會議所持百的，且將提高國內價格，損害國家經濟」。如關稅過低，則外國非必需品及奢侈品將大量湧入國內市塲，使本國工業化無法實現。「關稅率轉高或過低，對工商業落後國家在過度時期，均足誘致不良結果，欲求適中，殊非易事。中國代表國深感一工商業落後之國家，最須採用貨物定額或關稅定額，以調整其國庫」。備忘錄解釋謂：長期入超之國家如中國者，務須限制奢侈品及非必需品入口，而任必須品入口以保存其交換物資，在過渡時期以登記辦法限制奢侈品及非必須品入口，不僅必要而且合理。此種有選擇之限制，僅影響入口品之種類，面不影響入口之總數量。關於「過渡時期」，工商業落後國家可採用「合理量的限制」之定義爲何。該備忘錄謂，期間不能事先規定，日期亦不爲貨幣儲備及付款之情形所決定，貨幣儲備及付款，係表示金融穩定與工業發展之主要標誌者，故中國代表提議，過渡時期應展至（一）百分之五十，工人均已在現代工業企業就業，此等企業或係生產者或係分配者。（二）其國家百分之五十之收入，來自現代工業商業財政之企業，中國代表團希望此等條款，能加入世界貿易最後憲章內，俾工商業落後之各國可加速其工業化過程，最後能擴展世界貿易。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕美商米高梅電影公司，準備在滬建造第一流電影院之消息傳出後，此間人士，均極關懷。然該院之建築圖樣，迄未擬具，聞其一切裝置，將由美國總公司代爲設計。本市工務局，於該項提案通過後，即函該公司負責人，提出各項本市建築上必須遵行之原則。該公司對於一切條件，俱能接受，唯對於必須設立停車塲一項，認爲極爲困難，因靜安寺路梅白格路口之空地，本不甚大，遵照工務局之條件，必須於院前留出若干尺空地，以作將來拓寬馬路之用，若再闢停車塲，事實上已無可能，故擬將停車塲闢於地面下層，於戲院左右兩側，設進出口之地道。然工務局認爲上項設施，極不方便，且車輛行駛，必將緩慢擁擠，因而妨礙該路交通，故已函該公司，請其打消是項計劃。關於停車塲一點，並予以變通辦法，即所有出入該院之車輛，一律只准停於跑馬廳畔，然後由觀衆步行至戲院觀劇，惟戲院方面，必須派員工經常在停車處維特秩序，庶免犯規情事。聞米高梅影片公司當局，對於該項提議，已表示願意遵照辦理</p>

<h3>女靑年會發動捐募　昨舉行開幕典禮　目標一萬八千萬元　首名獲獎市長夫人親筆國畫</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕上海中華基督敎女靑年會第三十八届捐募大會，在總隊長吳市長夫人黃卓羣女士領導之下，將自本月一一日至二十三一日期內，展開一萬八千萬元目標一之募捐。昨日下午三時，該會在一安福路吳市長私邸舉行盛大之開幕典禮，到吳市長夫人，募捐副總隊長顏惠慶夫人及黃佐庭夫人，·潘議長公展，徐副議長寄廎，孔祥熙氏，敎育局李副局長熙謀，及地方名流中外仕女約三百人，由沈周粹英女士任主席。</p>
<p>發揚光大完成使命</p>
<p>首由吳市長夫人致詞：女靑年會乃發揚光明之團體，在敵僞時期，因受惡勢力之壓迫，致無從發揮其工作。現上海收復，必須掃除敵僞黑暗，女靑年會之責任殊爲重大，希望各界努力協助，以完成其使命。</p>
<p>需要光明　增加力量</p>
<p>繼由潘議長致詞略稱：今日到會閱貴會工作報吿上有「發光的源地」字樣，本人頗有所感，上海確責需要光明，祇有光明才能坍加力量。婦女在社會上担任很大部份之責任，至少亦有一半。女靑年會經費如能充足，則前途必無可限量，今後女靑年會進行一種工作，工作有何效能，將全視各位參加募捐有何結果，最後祝募捐成功。</p>
<p>婦女責任重大</p>
<p>孔祥熙氏表示：社會上有許多工作非男子所能做好，婦女責任重大，爲了國家社會着想，我們應該贊成女靑年會之損募，而不能僅以口頭表示。徐副議長亦認爲女靑年會之工作確爲必要，深信必能超出所期。旋由王秀卿女士報吿該會募捐與事工，高君哲女士報吿募捐組織事項。此次募捐基分五十隊，除總副隊長三位外，尙有募捐委員王心康夫婦，陳行夫人，陸梅僧等十二位。顧問計孔祥熙，潘公　，奚王　，王人麟，劉鴻生，席德柄等三十六人。</p>

<h3>倫道爾案審結　五日上午宣判　被告請駁回上訴　仍判不受理處分　招待會日期問題兩美軍官出庭證明　兩造律師又一場舌戰</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕美合衆社記者倫到爾，被德納粹間諜嫌疑犯沈克控吿訓謗一案，地院業已判決倫氏無罪。惟沈克方面竟仍不甘心，又向高院上訴，遂於昨晨續審，先由推事王健開庭繼續調査證據，約二小時，嗣即退庭，十分鐘後重開合議庭審理，由刑庭長章慶瀾任審判長，推事王健，張世傑陪審。兩造律師激辯甚烈，下午一時二十分，宣吿辯論終結，定十一月五日上午九時宣判。</p>
<p>昨日調査證據時，大半時間均用以證明美軍記者招待會究係何日所開，因採用合衆社稿之字林西報係四月十六日出版，而美軍方面爲倫道爾證明此稿內容確與記者招待會之報吿相符之證明書，出其時誤以此招待會之日期亦爲四月十六日，遂見矛盾，因當日開會之材料，決不能於當日淸晨即已見報也。然昨日美軍法庭出具此證明書之檢察官歐康納少校與法萊爾上尉，均特親自到庭證明，此招待會實係四月十五日所開，而倫道爾及柯興等，即就是日之報吿，發佈新聞，證明書上所提之日期確係未及細査，遂致錯誤。歐康納等就證人席時，均向庭上作軍禮，實爲中國法庭所僅見。</p>
<h3>弄錯開會日期　歐氏表示歉意</h3>
<p>歐氏稱：因甚爲忙碌，故弄錯開會日期，敬向庭上致歉。此招待會實係於十五日上午九時至十時間在美國總會舉行。且確曾在招待會說過，沈克奉德國政府之命，赴渝調査我方秘密工作人員在沿海一帶活動情形及聯合國人士潛赴內地之路綫。歐氏强調稱　克案所發表各點，在開記者招待會之前，外界確係不知，開會後始大白於世。事實上開會之時，即在沈克方被逮捕之後。是時姚律師忽問：沈克之活動之地點究係在滬或在渝？如沈所作活動係在滬，且在中德宣戰之後，則是時上海已爲德所控制，不能構成間諜罪。庭上遂提醒姚律師：此係在美軍法庭範圍之內」。倫道爾之辯護人陳庭銳律師亦起稱：「證明沈克有罪無罪，係美軍法庭之責任，姚律師如有宏論，何妨在軍事法庭中發表」？</p>
<h3>法萊爾上尉　作補充證明</h3>
<p>旋由法萊爾上尉補充證明稱：彼本人亦參加是日之記者招待會。早在此日之前一星期左右，彼曾通知此項德人在四月十五日到福州路五十三號報到，彼等果於是晨九時左右到達，即由歐康納少校加以逮捕。是時在塲之新聞記者及攝影記者頗多，倫道爾及柯興等追問此事原委，余等遂同往附近之美國總會，一問將此案發表。余本人早即奉命調査納粹情報機關歐哈德局之活動，早年隷張發奎將軍部下時，即曾協助調査，去年十一月來滬後，仍調査此案。所有調査結果，除送美軍　部外，亦已送張發奎將軍之司令部備案。余曾將本案事實吿知倫進爾君，倫君後即發表，而余是日所吿彼者，實尙不止其在報上所發表之材料也。法氏並稱：證明書上之日期因匆促未査檔案，遂致有誤，此外皆係眞實可靠者，且有證明。庭上即間何種證明？答謂可以證明沈克在戰事前，戰事中，始終是一個奸細！至此時，陳律師起稱？記者招待會之日期，及開會時所談之內容，皆已獲得證明，倫道爾報道之眞實，自更可證明矣。自　至右：美軍事法庭檢察官歐康納，翻譯袁倫仁，律師陳霆銳，被上訴人倫道爾。（紐約時報辦事處攝）</p>
<h3>雙方詞鋒銳利　空氣極度緊張</h3>
<p>此二美國軍官作蹬時，雙方律師立於兩側，盤詰之詞鋒皆甚銳利，空氣極度緊張，惟姚律師似未料到被吿方面竟謂此二人到庭，詰詢時或因未能充分準備之故，終至廢然而退。庭諭調査終結。時王推事退席，約十分鐘後，復開合議庭審理。</p>
<p>姚律師於叙述上訴理由時稱（一）倫道爾之報道與事實不符。（二）沈克即有活動，其活動之地域係在自己國內或已國盟邦所佔之地，不能構成間諜罪，故倫道爾之報道，顯係惡意侮辱。（三）沈克無對不起中國之處。姚氏稱：「倫道爾僅能證明其新聞之來源，若謂是人家所吿訴我的話，我就可以不負責任，是於法無據的！」</p>
<h3>姚律師發抒奇論　各記者相願駭然</h3>
<p>姚律師此語一出，旁聽之各記者皆相顧駭然，以爲今後採訪社會新聞之人，如非兼任警察局長或總編　　、勢將每日有如倫　爾氏　立被告　中受審之可　，而採訪政治或軍事新聞之記者，更無時不可飽受　累矣。而姚律師乃又攻擊美軍總部對偵査中之案件，不應先行對外發表文字。且　刑法中規定可以轉載之文字，　中央及地力之會議，法院公開審判時之經過情形，及公衆策會等數種。撓律師自稱彼亦知敦睦邦交，但爲法律之　　計，彼亦不能不知其不可而爲之。結語中仍要求處倫道爾以應得之叩。</p>
<h3>新聞記者責任　原係搜集材料</h3>
<p>庭上遂問倫氏謂能證明其所記載之事爲確實否？倫答，可以證明，今日在塲者除已作證之美軍法庭歐康納少校及法萊爾上尉外，尙有負責偵査本案之格　，及梅君。上次開庭時呈案之美軍法庭筆錄中，亦已可證明沈克爲歐哈特局薪俸最高之一人。關於陳介大使及吳紹澍氏所提證函，倫稱：沈克實係「兩而問諜」。新聞記者之責任原係收集新開材料，加以佔量，然後公之於世。新聞記者非專事調査案件之人。本人身爲記者二十餘年，惟知經由正當來源，取得材料，忠實報道。今日受審，實爲不解。對新聞記者不必親做調査工作一點，希於判決書中予以確定說明。余向不識沈克其人，然沈克之罪行，被吿方面固並非不能提出證據也。</p>
<p>陳律師對陳介吳紹澍二氏有利沈克之證函，認爲如不到庭具結證明，在證明中殊無價値可言。倫道爾亦憤然稱：適姚律師謂沈克在其本國之明國所佔境內之活動，不能構成犯罪，然則汪精衛在日本所佔之地內活動，亦不構成犯罪乎？</p>
<h3>新聞是否真確　發言人負責</h3>
<p>陳律師起而辯稱：本案事實，顯有二種：（一）倫道爾之記載來源係根據美軍主辦之記者招待會，如無添造或謊造之記載，被吿即不負賣任。（二）新聞本身是否眞確，應由該記者招待會之發言人負責，被吿不負責任。上訴人代理人喋喋不休，一番偉論，乃將此二者合而爲一，甚至稱沈克爲中華民國之友云云，實與本案毫不相干。至倫道爾對美軍記者招待會之記載是否正確，則是日有此記載者不止合衆社一家，聯合社亦有之，如係事後僞造，安能不約而同？上　人方面謂此訊係擱壁虛造，故意侮辱沈克，而事實土不轉已有四月十五日之招待會爲據，且有當時出席之　　　少校與法國爾上尉二人來此說明倫氏之記載眞招待會所報吿完全相回、未有增損、且當日除口頭報吿外，美軍情報處並有書面之記綠，開於沈克之　德國　高軍事當局之命來華活動，又與倫道爾之記載相同，故倫道爾記載之眞確性，已有確切證明。如沈克欲表示自己並非間諜，　可在美軍法庭中提出。本案應就案論案就事論事，沈克是否間碟點，實已不必再提，然如庭上欲知此事詳細者，則被告方面固亦有證據，芷不畏懼。沈克危害中國政府，危害巾華民族，危害抗日戰爭，今乃僅因他人記載此種活動，即向其意圖破壞之國家之法庭中提出訴訟，實屬荒謬已極。</p>
<h3>第一審判決理由　不能苟同者數點</h3>
<p>至第一審判決理由，辯護人亦有深感不能　同者數　：（一）原判決　依刑事訴證法第二百十一條，犯罪之被害人可提訴訟。而明文並無敵僑可提訴訟之規定。不論何國何法，無法律可全部包括者，故民法第一　仍重習慣，刑事　　法第一條中亦有本法或其他法律云云。試舉例言之，各國大使有治外法櫂，即不在刑訴法規定之內。最近鈞院對聯總職員被控案未予受理，亦是一例。（二）然則敵僑之不能提起訴訟有根據乎？第一審中會由自訴人提出海牙公約第八條，是否　章取義，固不可知，且係成例規定，而非強制規定。（三）以國際公法而論，德國無負責之政府，換言之，亦即無政府以遵守國際公法。對手方旣無政府，而我國法庭乃斷斷必欲遵守國際公法，辯護人亦不能苟同。（四）第一審時，自訴人會謂如敵僑不能起訴，則殺人越貨，祇須被害人爲敵僑，皆因不能起訴而不能成爲罪案，社會秩序，將爲之擾亂，此實原審見解錯誤，因國家有檢察官，仍可起訴也。（五）刑事訴訟法第二九六條，賣係指公訴而言，自訴應引三六〇條。凡　僑有不利於駐在國行爲，且未經駐在國政府准許其居留者，依法實不得自訴、故今日請求二點：（一）駁回上訴；（二）仍請判處不受理之處分。</p>
<p>最後，倫道爾仍請堂上迅將本案結束，俾其工作得不致　受影響。庭少　　　　論終結，定十一月五日上午九時宣判。昨日倫道爾之證人除美軍法庭二軍法官外，尙有格雷，梅君等二人，庭上以案情已明，朱予傳訊。</p>

<h3>秘密電臺　偵查結果　大多數並無特殊作用　僅係牟利性商業機構</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕最近治安當局利用科學儀器，破獲私自設立之秘密電台頗多，經價査結果，其中大多數並無特殊作用，僅爲牟利性質之私營商業電台、由於本市電信機構業務擁擠，商人拍發商電，往往費　極久，甚至有貨物已經運到而電報猶未抵達之情形，因此私設電台，遂應運而生。惟此種電合旣未經政府核准，於法自屬不合，故仍予取締。</p>

<p>〔秦聯奎律師答〕（一）如欲增加給付臘以復員後辦理民事訴訟補充條例爲根據，（二）無增加若干倍之法定標準，（三）如債務人不願增加除起訴外無其他辦法。</p>

<p>對敲發生破綻　股市人心虛</p>
<p>華股昨以紗布大樓某對敲字號倒閉，開前已露恐慌，開時三小熱已吿微挫，永紗初喊六五〇元，即屬爭售，是以開盤未成，改以六四〇元爲開市價，信和居次，亦跌至二七五元開市，開後逢低買戶潮湧，至吿拉高，但爲時甚暫，不久高後漸回，同時塲內風聲鶴唳，經紀人方面恐慌萬狀，多方頗有斬售以自保，供意奇盛，空方亦逞勢示威，中途一致跌至新低價，十時半後，低後轉盤、但大勢仍帶恐慌，後以塲外對敲號家，停做新交易，專做了結，補空漸起，一九八號八九號等有補，加之廣帮若二三二號等亦進，逐漸回升，近午在恍惚巾乍起乍落，檯面上補空甚湧，臨收均吿回漲，三小熟吸收有人，勢忽俏利，頗肯力爭上游，結果較前收計熱股永紗跌百分之四，美亞信和降半成强，景福新光微挫，勤興反吿微升，冷股水泥新亞華豐平平，麗安微升，餘者均吿微跌至半成不等，塲外各股，尙形平定。</p>

<h3>金鈔均告鬆動</h3>
<p>烚赤昨買氣稍殺，央行再加壓力，略起回跌，晨開二三三萬元左右，開後尙形平穩，高價不過二三三萬五，後漸感壓迫，散多亦吿了結，遂起跌風　逐漸退至二三一萬左右，十時後央行以二三一萬之價，配給一二〇條，入後更爲怯軟，曾跌至二三〇萬二，始轉穩健，午刻在二三二萬光景盤旋，午後聞隔週交易又扳高至二三三萬五左右，結果較前收小八千，飾金掛念四萬六，紋銀平而銀元微降，暗息價在一角半左右。</p>
<p>外幣轉呈鬆動，美鈔暗市中因禁止流通之說又起，賣方較股而退至四〇五〇元，較前日續吿跌落，港票因申電報升，銷路更滯，昨降至八九〇元光景，較前收跌二十元，港匯亦被帶低至八八〇元左右，印匯一〇七〇元左右，英匯一四一〇〇元光景，均屬有售少求，美匯牌價未更，對做仍寂。</p>
<h3>香港金價直瀉</h3>
<p>香港一日電，邇來此間金價下降至二百九十三元，其下降原因，經向有關方面探悉謂：純係月前此間銀行經港當局批准向墨西哥第一批訂購黄金十萬盎司，均已先後如數抵港，流行市面，供過於求，故市價趨跌，不久以前各銀行又續向港當局再度請求向墨西哥購金七萬盎司，亦將抵港，據一般推測，金價仍有下降可能云。</p>

<h3>布價跌進成本　輕磅雙馬一八八萬</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日紗市始疲終挺，晨初因各廠配給紗號業廿支紗，有相當數額，業中人乃以手存現貨套賣者頗不乏人。是以特雙馬一度降至二百〇六萬，輕磅竟有喊一八八，一八九萬者，市塲上一片呌賣之聲，僅漢口帮略有乘小補進，因漢口市價較申地略高，尙有利可圖，又以京粵等帮亦乘低吸買，價乃復挺，收市時廿支紗，榮辱互見，大致尙稱堅定，惟四十二支機，因去化較呆，約跌三五萬之譜。</p>
<p>昨布市亦　續下降，良以銀根抽緊，購買力益覺稀薄，龍頭紡建開出僅八萬元，較上次價又跌三千元，其他中檔如五福等，祗開七萬六千元，而申請者竟然百中無一，可見市况之慘淡，按照配紗價格，布價有跌過成本者，生產商之嚴重時期又臨，假如生產原料價格不减，複製工業前途，殊難樂觀。</p>

<h3>美棉回漲後　政府不擬採取行動　面職品統制辯法將取消</h3>
<p>〔聯合社新奧林斯一日電〕棉花期貨今日收盤每包漲八元六角五分至十元，現貨漲九元七角五分。</p>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓一日電〕星期四及本日棉價之上漲，已使政府立即採取行動，以維持棉市之要求，趨於緩和。經濟平準局現正考慮取消棉織物價統制，政府收買計劃及其他措置，但截至今日迄未宣佈任何決議。據棉業中人稱：除非棉市再發生跌價情事，彼等相信，關於棉織物之政府計劃或延至十一月五日大選以後始行發表。</p>
<p>出口獎金　或將取消</p>
<p>〔路透社波斯頓一日電〕美國全國棉花製造商協會棉花委員會上週報吿稱：美國原棉出口獎勵辦法，係一稱臨時辦法，其目的在協助美國農民維持國外市塲，並疏通美國現時所有之大量存棉，此項辦法，自實施以來，似已達到目的。該委員會鑒於美國存棉已無過剩情形，特建議美國農業部考慮取消該項出口獎勵、該報吿續稱：「美國多數紗廠製造特製品時，須仰給於亞洲棉花。據最近報吿，中國棉花，至少在一年以內，絕少進口希望，漢口及天津兩區域內，是否特種植大量棉花，足供出口之需，尙屬疑問，同時自印度轍人足量棉花是否可能亦成問題」。</p>

<p>又該局自收購生絲以來，已達九批，八九兩批於上月卅日辦理收購事宜，八批爲一百四十担，九批爲五百担，共爲六百四十担但依據外銷會之辦法，不合格者不予收購，該局當於八批中剔除十五担，九批剔除三十担，共剔除四十五祖，僅收五百九十五担，述前七批三千七百一十担，總計收購四千三百零五担。</p>

<h3>贛積極開發煤礦　安源天河兩大煤鑛區劃歸國營　將設立新式採煤工廠成立煤鑛局</h3>
<p>— 本報特約記者俞寗頗</p>
<p>七日景德鎮訊</p>
<p>煤爲生活的必需品，又爲原動力的要素，煤業的盛衰，直接緊乎國計民生，長江一帶，工商業較稱發達，年需焦煤在四百萬噸以上。惟揚子附近，向無大規模的煤鑛，以供需求，過去長江一帶用煤，除開　年銷百數十萬噸，大部都是日煤和撫順煤，華煤市場，幾全被它操縱，以沿江各省，均爲產煤之區，日用的煤，還不能自給，寗非同一世界上希異的史實嗎？</p>
<p>全省產煤量</p>
<p>上項需煤救濟和供應，祗有江西煤產最佔優勢，亦最稱便利，贛省儲藏的煤量，因爲沒有整個調查與統計，所以現在不能確定它的儲量，究竟有若干。據中央地質調查所的推測約計，全省煤的儲量，爲九八九兆噸，佔全國產煤區的第七位。詳細考察它推測的根據，僅限於樂平，萍鄉，吉安，豐城等縣，其他如宜春，萬載，武寗，上饒，玉山，新喻，高安，和贛南各縣，概未計及，如把上列各縣產煤區加入統計，至少產煤量當在三千五百兆噸以上。</p>
<p>各鑛顯衰敗</p>
<p>江西煤鑛最大的，就是萍鄉煤鑛，也就是全國最大的煤鑛，其次是樂平的鄱樂煤鑛，再次爲吉安的天河煤鑛。在從前漢陽鐵工廠開鑄的時候，祗萍鄉一處，一天的數額，已超出三千餘噸，年計六千餘噸。嗣後因受時局影響，及漢陽鐵工廠的停辦，產量已減少了一大半，但此時還可設法維持，經過民十九年後，更見衰落，營業方面又受着外煤暢銷各地的打擊，頗有維持不能的情況。至樂平鄱樂公司，同樣的受赤匪擾亂了好幾次，產量也隨之不能復原。其他各小鑛的產量，更難維持一定的數額。民十八年，全省煤銷，銳減至六十六萬三千八百五十餘噸，十九年減至四十五萬六千三百四十餘噸，二十年以後，減至三十四萬一千餘噸</p>
<p>省府謀管制</p>
<p>最近贛省府以本省煤鑛產量，逐漸增加，惟以人工開採，出數甚微，建設　爲調劑全贛煤需，特訂立三年開採計劃，預期供應不置，　除安源與天河兩地煤鑛劃歸國營外，所有豐城，宜春，萬載等地之民營鑛業，一律管制，並限期原領有開採證者，申請登記，否則取銷其開採權。關於天河煤鑛開採計畫，已由資源委員會與贛省府合組籌備處，專司其事，將於年內，成立煤鑛局，進行機構開採，預計三年產量，可達八十萬噸。茲將安源天河兩煤鑛過去與現在狀況，分誌如下：以見贛省大煤鑛區的一般。</p>
<p>安源鑛概況</p>
<p>萍鄉煤鑛爲中國大鑛之一，鑛區在萍鄉的安源，寬十華里，開採爲天磁山的支脈，安源山距縣東南十五里，天磁山高六百九十尺，斜二十九度，其脈來自蓮花縣的馬跡嶺，內藏煤量，據發現此鑛之德技師述稱：每年縱操百萬噸，亦須繼續五百年云，其蘊藏煤量的豐富，就可想而知了！</p>
<p>該鑛的沿革，系前清光緒二十二年湖廣總督張之洞氏，創立漢陽鐵政局，因爲燃料仰給於開平馬鞍山，唐山，英國及日本等處，價格昂貴，煤質不良，遂返　自行開採煤鑛，以供應用，特派德鑛師赴湘鄂贛皖一帶調查，於二十四年覓得萍鄉一大煤田，色黑如漆，光澤甚強，富粘結性，揮發分少，適於焦煉，供製鐵之用，乃由張氏和盛宣懷集金百萬兩，從事開採。二十八年，復加擴張，向德商禮和洋行，相繼借入德金四百萬馬克，並聘德人賴綸爲技師長，派張紹甄爲總辦。三十四年盛氏將萍鄉煤鑛，漢陽鐵廠，大冶鐵廠，合併爲一，名曰漢冶萍公司。當時日人羡着德人投資成功，即蓄意乘機競取，盛氏以既組公司，即以日債換德債，後來日方更慫恿擴充，於廢清末年，借款已達三千萬元之巨·民國紀元，至歐戰時，該鑛大有蓬勃氣象，每日出產量曾達三千噸，那時鐵的需要很廣，祗因政府不加監督，主辦者又濫借日債，因而喪失利權，使千載一時的良機，放鬆消逝。當時曾有人計算此中損失，實較公司全部財產還多。民十二年共黨主持萍鑛工人俱樂部成立以後，工潮頻仍，生產因之銳減，同時復受軍事的影響，和運輸的不便，經營愈見困難。十四年漢滿鐵廠停工，萍煤因之遭大打擊，是年秋起，所出的煤，僅供鑛廠自用，並銷售當地。十五年革命軍興，又由赤化工人主持開採。十七年春復由當地士紳駐軍長官籌資數萬，組織公司，收買產煤，代爲推銷，用維鑛工伙食，卒以力薄資少，無法維持。是年冬贛省府爲顧全地方治安，維持數千員工之生活計，委派何照曾爲萍鑛專員，墊款維持，開工後，日產煤八百噸。十八年秋江西省政府改組，改派蕭家　爲萍鑛專員，任事年餘，虧負三十餘萬。二十年春，省府又改組，派董綸爲萍鑛專員，並由當局商請旅湘同鄉墊款修理。二十年六月因直井底排水機器发生障碍，一时修理不及，致八方井下層，全被淹没，每日出煤，只五百餘噸。二十一年經江西鑛務專門委員會擬具救濟萍鄉煤鑛治標辦法，續委何照曾爲萍鑛專員，劉文藝爲副專員，負責辦理。迨抗戰軍興，鑛務復陷停頓，最近經贛省府重整全省煤鑛區管制計劃中，以安源鑛區，範圍較大，劃歸國營，今後該鑛之復興，不久當可見諸實現。</p>
<p>天河鑛概況</p>
<p>天河距吉安縣治一百二十里，距南昌水程六百里，鑛區距天河十五里之洲源村，該處煤層，厚自丈餘，至八九丈，藏量甚豐。明清曾有人開採，清光緒末年，有宣化葉表可氏，以小規模計畫，用人工開挖，歷時數月，尚未採得鑛源所在，葉氏雖受虧蝕，仍不灰心，復籌款繼續開採，翌年果獲巨利，因呈請建應轉呈實部，請領鑛照，逐年獲利不貲。惟利之所在，趨者若鶩，先後在該處租山領照開挖者，不下數十家。民十五年，各鑛每日出煤，約三四百担，鑛工約三四百人，所產的煤，銷於輪船鐵路及蕪湖等埠，因煤質頗佳，均樂購用。赤匪擾亂時鑛井被毀壞，幾至完全破產。迨和平後，中央監察委員張靜江氏，以該鑛原經理人，曾向中央陳述天河煤量的豐富，如能集資開採，不但足維多數鑛工生活，且能源源供給國家生產的建設，因由張氏出資三十萬，將原有各鑛井加以擴充，並計畫修築自鑛井至船埠十三里之輕便鐵道。至廿二年張氏派余質民馳往鑛區一帶實地勘察，認爲烟煤豐富，且可煉取焦煤，余氏復命後，一面派張氏計畫興工，一面仍用土法開採。</p>
<p>其他各煤局，一共有十餘家，十五年後，僅存的計有義昌·遠大·復昌·吉昌·惠康·昌明·安濟·七家，鑛局面積，大者五百餘畝，小有四十餘畝，七家合計有一千五百餘畝，折合九十餘公頃，該鑛區最感困難的，即爲交通的不便。產區至天河十五畝，全係山路，行車不易，全用人力挑運，由鑛山至天河，每人每日只可挑二次，自天河至吉安水程一百八十里，在春夏水漲之時，載重千担之民船，可通行無阻。冬令水淺，只可載重五百担，運輸工人，均係當地工人，雇用既屬不易，增減尤感困難，在最忙時，工人減少，最閑時工人加多，各鑛局對於運煤，係採輸運制，每月各家輪值日數，均有規定，不能更改。省府以該鑛區產量豐富，應作大規模之開採，分作多數小鑛，有阻於鑛業之發展，且施工易生障礙，各種紛爭亦易於發生，曾計劃合併開採，卒因工艱費巨，未獲成功。</p>
<p>最近據當局估計，該鑛儲量，有一千七百萬噸，現由資源委員會與贛省府合資暫用人力開採，一面計畫成立新式採煤工廠，預計三年建設成功，在業務方面，開採烟煤，以一部分運銷吉安，供贛河流域輪船及各發電廠機器廠燃料之用，一部分供煉焦之用。在設備方面，特設置七五〇蓋羅瓦特汽輪機，發電機二套，俾改用電機採冶，在第一年產煤，預計有七萬二千噸，第二年十八萬噸，第三年五十四萬噸，全部需設備費達美金二百萬元，一俟取得資源會同意，即可成立新廠。</p>
<h3>由邵伯到寶應</h3>
<p>— 赫森</p>
<p>廿五日高郵訊</p>
<p>邵伯——它是屬於江都縣的一個市鎮，在地圖上看起來，不過一小點，沒有什麽特殊，可是一年來蘇北流亡揚州，鎮江以及京滬各地的難胞，，對於它是特別關心，尤其是揚泰兩地的民眾，可以說對它是寢食不忘，因爲他們感受的威脅是太大了，它距揚州城不過四十華里，朝發夕至，他們眼看着流亡難胞的痛苦，耳聽着所謂「解放區」的慘狀，假如揚城不保，他們的命運又是如何呢？所以他們時常提心吊胆地注視它。</p>
<p>同時，邵伯是運河的咽喉，華中區的門戶，它的地位之重要，好比地中海的直布羅陀，和黑海的博斯普魯斯。「邵伯守得牢，華中才得保」，這是共軍在邵伯所寫的標語，所喊的口號，的確！他們憑藉地形的複雜，工事的堅強，雖然華中區心臟——淮陰，被國軍收復了，可是他們對邵伯還是想決心地死守。當本月五日，國軍開始反擊的時候，他們從興化高郵各地分路增援，希圖固守此華中區的門戶，豈知他們終於敵不過國軍砲火的威力，和官兵的英勇，在沙江壩南岸的一戰，所有堅強的九個堡壘，全被摧毀，三百多官兵除被俘四十八個外，其餘的沒有逃走一個，都到了「鄂都城」。</p>
<p>連夜趕架浮橋　三處實行強渡</p>
<p>佔領沙江壩南岸後，本可乘勝直入，可是被寬達六十餘公尺的沙江所阻，不能飛渡，因此是連夜趕架木筏式的浮橋，利用砲火的掩護分三處強渡，有些善於游泳的官兵，竟不顧寒冷，不惜犧牲，卟通！卟通！像一羣鴨子一樣的跳入水中，很迅速的泅到彼岸，搶奪工事，是夜沙江北岸陣地及東嶽廟據點，均被國軍攻佔，同時我左翼部隊經一天一夜之血戰，突破敵人八道堅強工事，而達邵伯南街，匪數次增援反撲，終無法挽回其悲慘的命運，號稱勝軍的第十縱隊，八十五，八十七，八十九三個團分路向揚莊，真武廟，昭關壩等地潰逃，六日晨我完全佔領邵伯，隨即分路腳尾急追，因之著名的天險易守難攻的昭關壩亦僅戰鬥三小時即被佔領了，蘇北人有一句俗語「攻下昭關，死人上萬千」，可是我們僅僅死傷了幾十個人，就打下了昭關了，迨至午后六時我軍追過了露筋鎮。</p>
<p>筆者六日上午八時三十分，即抵邵伯，五區林專員，江都張縣長，以及駐揚州各報記者，都紛紛陸續來到，我們一面張貼佈告，宣撫民眾，一方面巡視戰場，察看戰蹟，跑了許多路，大家並不感覺疲倦，同時我們還決定午后二時召集一個民眾大會。</p>
<p>眞是出乎我們意料以外，時間不到一點鐘，鎮上的民眾扶老携幼，男男女女，都紛紛地朝着他們過去曾經時常參加「鬥爭」，「清算」的廣場上集合了，到會的人雖然祗有八百餘人，可是留在鎮上的人，除看門的外，都去了，他們每個人面目上所表現的興奮，實在無法形容。</p>
<p>大會開始，沒有舉行什麽儀式，首由張縣長介紹筆者首先說話，我沒有準備說什麽，我僅簡單地首先說明抗戰勝利後，爲什麽還要打，爲什麽大家還不能安居樂業的原因，以及政府對於共黨一再容忍退讓的情形，其次我問他們，爲什麽大家今日弄得如此面黃肌瘦，衣不蔽體？共產黨不是把你們解放了嗎？他們異口同聲感歎地說：「解放了！你們再不來，再被他們解放兩個月，我們都活不成了」！最後：關於今後應該注意遵守的幾件事，分別提出來告訴他們，他們很誠懇地表示接受。</p>
<p>我講完後，李副旅長·林專員·張縣長等繼續講演，時間雖已經超過兩小時，可是秩序始終如一，他們興奮愉快的情緒溢於眉宇，說至動人處，他們一致鼓掌，總計鼓掌不下二十餘次，在民眾的大會上，我從來沒有見過此種良好的情形，散會後，我和張縣長說：比揚州的民眾大會如何？他們是受過訓練的啊！張縣長沒有回答，報之一笑。</p>
<p>在歸途中，我獨自想，一般人都認爲共產黨對民眾的宣傳和訓練是如何的了不起，今日看來，他們宣傳訓練的效果，原來如此，這也許是出乎他們意料以外！寄語中共！欺騙的宣傳，是沒有用的，你們欲想成功，還得改變作風啊！否則打下去，也還是沒有希望！</p>
<p>七日拂曉，國軍繼續前進，我們預計在車達邏五里壩等處，還有一場惡戰，這兩個地方是高郵的門戶，地形很複雜，工事也很堅強，據情報車邏還有一個團的兵力固守着，高郵還有八十二，八十四團準備死守，可是我們的官兵，還感覺他們的人數太少，打得不痛快，一打就跑，跑了豈不是還等待下次再打，這眞是打得嚕嚇，共產黨不但政治商談反覆嚕嚇，打仗亦是這一套，我希望來一次總清算，痛痛快快的來一次一勞永逸的殲滅戰，但是他們邊打邊跑，邊跑邊打，同邊打邊談的調調兒，如出一轍，由此可知他們的黨政軍人員是一邱之貉耳。</p>
<p>國軍開入高郵　乘勝分路追擊</p>
<p>果然，前鋒進抵車邏，他們雖憑工事頑抗，可是敵膽已寒，無法支持，戰鬥不到兩小時，即被我佔領，俘獲了幾十個人，得了幾十條槍，還得了三門極新極完整的迫擊砲，此外被我擊斃的亦不在少數。是夜進抵五里壩，高城在望，官兵們個個奮勇，他們打算今夜一定要到城裏去借宿，可是共軍把五里壩的橋樑點着了，經撲滅之後修好已經是八號的上午八點鐘，國軍就在這時候進了高郵城，同時分路向東向北追擊。</p>
<p>筆者進了高郵城，第一個使我驚奇的是高郵全城的民眾擺着香案立在道旁，歡迎國軍，還有好多老太婆口唸着阿彌陀佛，「老中央眞回來了」，同時鞭砲之聲振耳欲聾，有的小孩跟着隊伍跑，問我們的士兵：「爲什麽你們不早來」！共產黨統制高郵將近一年，他們的成績是失盡民心，我很希望各黨各派，社會賢達到高郵來看一看所謂「解放區」的眞正的民意。</p>
<p>我到城內各處巡視了一週，高郵城的景象比邵伯好得多，因爲邵伯經過了一場惡戰，破壞比較的多，高郵沒有什麽破壞，民眾除了一部份壯丁被脅迫帶走外，其餘的都還在家，我們走到一處，那一處的老百姓即圍攏起來，很興奮，很愉快，很親熱的和我們談話，他們告訴了我們許多使我們想像不到的資料，他們對共產黨是恨極了，有一個七十多歲的老太婆和我說：我的兒子有一輛腳踏車，有一天，「四老爺」到我家裏硬要拿去，我死不肯放，我說：你們不是講民主嗎？爲什麽不講理？我的兒子被你們拉去犧牲了，他留下這一輛車子，我是要做紀念的。你們不能夠再忍心拿去，我話還沒有說完，他們就聲勢洶洶拿槍指着我，我也顧不得一切，即挺着胸膛說：好！你們打吧！我這條老命反正活不成了，結果，他們對天打了一槍，沒有拿去，如此情形，經過了好幾次，老爺！你說他們好不好？你們再不來，我們老百姓的命簡直活不成了。這位老太婆，連說帶做，像表演話劇似的說了這麼一段，我們雖然表示同情，也只好空言安慰她，總之，每一個人民對共黨是真個恨極了，恨不得食其肉而寢其皮。</p>
<p>事後據說邵伯失陷後，共軍還想堅守高郵，曾經召集二千多民伕連夜加強城內外工事，七日的晚上，粟裕的第一師萬餘人業已經過興化向高郵增援，可是沒有到達二溝，高郵被我們收復了，來不及援救，高城得免於砲火的浩刧，同時據說凡屬已登紅榜的人約有千餘人，計劃準備屠殺，由於我們進軍的神速，得免於難，這眞算是幸運了。</p>
<p>高郵收復後，國軍的追擊部隊一路指向興化，一路沿運河向寶應推進，沿途如推枯拉朽，秋風掃落葉一般地於十一日即抵寶應，整個的運河綫由此完全打通了</p>
<p>二十日上午九時，我們仍乘砲艇到汜水，轉汽車回到高郵，回來後，我看到十九日的報紙，登載着中共十七日在延安發表對時局的聲明，極盡詆毀誣衊的能事，滿紙糊言，實不值批評，不過我們親眼看到收復區的情形，證之中共的聲明，實在是可笑，可憐，又可恨！他們平素自恃號稱百萬的正規軍，二百多萬的民兵，可以造反，實行內亂的時候，就爭城奪地，到處壞擊國軍，迨至國軍稍一反擊，即一敗塗地，始自知迷信的武力不足恃，就出來喊呌停戰！停戰！無條件停戰！政府寬大爲懷，准許停戰了，他們又提出無理的要求，使得和平不能實現，他們今日反稱所謂八次讓步，反提出恢復信義人格，我眞不知他們厚顏無恥到這種地步，尤其無恥的，他們開口人民利益，閉口人民要求，好像人民是他們的專利品，成千成萬的的淹沒，成千成萬的慘殺，成千成萬的奴役，這也是人民的利益。這也是人民的需求？不錯！人民的需求，是要求政府快一點把你們這班禍國殃民的敗類消滅啊！</p>
<p>最後他們還無恥的說：「我們沒有旁的要求，祗要求恢復一月十三日國共雙方軍事位置」。不錯！我們是可以的，我們是願意的，因爲我們是國家的軍隊，我們隨便調到什麽地方都可以，不過，眞的要問問人民，要問問所謂「解放區」裏的人民，最好是請毛澤東，周恩來到蘇北來問一問，尤其是周恩來先生，他是蘇北人，現在交通也很方便，可以順便看看他自己的家鄉，只要蘇北的老百姓有一個人說他們好，歡迎他們，願意我們走，我們是絕對的請求政府把我們調走，讓他們來恢復一月十三日的位置。中共人士啊！醒來吧！不要做夢了，放下屠刀，立地成佛，這才是你們的眞正出路！</p>

<p>市立劇校出來的人，將是推動時代巨輸的推動者！是促進社會進步的動力；是引導無數沒有受過學校敎育的同胞們走進「禮義廉恥」境域里的領導者；他們是民族的靈魂，是人民大衆的導師；糾正社會風尙的是他們；使人們走入正軌生活裏的也是他們。市立劇校訓練他們，敎育他們，其意義及功用是超過其他任何學校的！</p>
<p>市立劇校的將被裁撤，理由是爲了省下每月三十萬零幾千的經費去創辦一所國民學校。這可以說：不是一個理由！難道上海市立唯一的戲劇學校，爲了要挖肉補瘡，就可以被裁撤嗎？</p>
<p>我們需要市立劇校！市立劇校必須存在！尤其是站在我們影劇的，我們自己的立塲，所以我們更需要它！更希望市立劇校能被保留！</p>
<h3>新片雜評</h3>
<p>— 馬博良</p>
<p>一，塵海浮雲</p>
<p>美國導演中，飽才琪劉別謙實在都是不足道哉，「蝴蝶夢」的希區考克，「翠堤春曉」「紐的奇譚」的裘利安杜槐佛，「迷魂艷遇」的雷諾克萊亞和這張片子的卡潑拉，有我們最喜歡的特色。我們曾經想過美國影片應該從絢爛歸向平淡，這一種格調由戰時的「人類的喜劇」「女皇獵艷」「沙塲歸來」可見一班，那是因爲戰爭的災難的敎訓。希區考克等三人早有更深的趨向，卡潑拉却是第一個從平淡生活中着手的人。「塵海浮雲」的題名遠較「浮生若夢」爲佳、這裏有藍空裏明凈的浮雲，伹是沒有浮生的塵夢，是那麽一個老套的故事，相同的題材有「陋巷一朶花」「少女懷春」，不同的是卡潑拉的戲有充份的人間味，而且以好萊塢空前少有的勇敢抨擊資本階級，他追求一種身心的自足的快樂。我眞喜歡卡潑拉描繪的平民家庭，自得其樂的人們，爲了虛僞的資產階級突然降臨時露出的窘態，導演的手法包藏多少誇張，伹在小情侶大閙酒店的一幕，誇張的性質也是一種爽朗的喜悅，老跛子舉標欲有所投，便是細膩動人的明證，惟一的缺陷是我們不敢贊同軍火富商的醒悟，對於老跛子的訓言，他應有更大的忿怒，然後才有更多的反省。演員技藝全部盡善盡美，琪恩亞瑟容華淸麗，也許不好的是聲音略啞，也許免戲中人性情的太痴，不過我們就是喜歡人間的這份糊塗，眞率。</p>
<p>二，重逢有日</p>
<p>向來視戀愛薄如秋雲，這本戲却告訴我愛情的眞實和美麗，在諒解下相互接觸生活，我相信這是幸福的不二法門。寳台爾有一種哀婉，湖濱散步的酣靜和新年舞會的狂歡，隱隱都有無聲息冬日黃昏的凄淸，雖然是「相思曲」一樣傳奇性的故事，不同的是有很多的人情味，白蓓拉一家三口表現出來的，美國小城的溫暖的家庭，不少優美的畫面，旅舍主人領導蔡克入臥室，蔡克的神經症的發作，湖畔的小語，牢獄會晤，俱有詩情畫意。可愛的是演　，琴逑羅吉絲嬌婉勝前，作風細膩，約瑟夫考登平穩，秀蘭鄧波兒演一知半解的小姑娘，眞摯動人，俏皮的時候比哭泣的時候好。散戲回家，我還記得街燈上的雨下淸脆的叩擊，那麽和諧，正是這部戲的風味。</p>
<p>三，公主與海盜</p>
<p>滑稽片對浪邀故事的一個極端的夢，這回是拿了海盜公主之流作爲尋開心的對象，雖然笑匠鮑勃霍伯不外是那些老套，倒底不是拳打脚踏的硬滑稽，「公主與海盜」大槪有「迷魂陣五倍以上的幽默，尋求鬆弛的感覺，我得到一片快樂的笑聲。可是出來了，我連琪妮梅亞的笑容也忘記了，結尾的突出，可以證明編劇人的努力，高爾溫和他的導演至少有一點認眞。</p>
<h3>關於「情海妒潮」</h3>
<p>— 琳</p>
<p>這是傑姆斯希爾頓著述中給米高梅攝成影片的又一部傑作，他的「桃源　跡」與「萬世師表」搬上銀　以後。曾獲得一致贊譽；最近，「鴛夢重溫也已映過，得到好許。在「情海妒潮」中，希爾頓寫一個精神病患者，基於他的變態心理而造成的命案。這個從瘋人院裏逃出米的人，有妻甚美。但他疑惑地與他的朋友有私終於設計了一個佈局精密的自殺，謀假禍於他朋友。錯綜的劇情便如此展開了。</p>
<p>「情海妒潮」的女主角股格麗裏曼是被稱爲現代嘉寳紅極一時的女星，與嘉寳同是瑞典籍，溫文而美麗。兩個男主角是羅勃蒙高茂萊與善演偵探片的喬治山德士。</p>
<h3>歐陽飛鶯　將赴北美</h3>
<p>— 江鳥</p>
<p>「鶯飛人間」中的女主角歐陽飛鶯，是一個初上銀幕的歌星。她有迷人的歌喉，和健全的身體，因此使她有了宏亮而又悅耳的歌聲。她對人很和藹，處事也很大方，她自己常常對人說：這次上銀幕，她想也沒有想到。在試　頭之前，她連怎樣拍電影也不知道，也沒有看見過。所以，對這次成績的好壞，自己決不敢領卜。只希望能在放映之後，多多地得到外界和前輩先生們的指示！</p>
<p>她說話　是那麽歉虛和親切的。其實，她在「鶯飛人間一中，已經不可能失敗，這是因爲她自己的努力和　虛心學習的緣故。但是，因爲她沒有演劇經騐，所以，在對話的時候，還有一點小小的過失，那就是　　有注　到說話時的停頓和間歇！</p>
<p>她是電影界的新人材，能見備電影上所需要的各　技術條件：她能騎馬，能游冰，能打槍；其他一般人們所能玩好東西，如騎自行車，跳舞，打球，平劇，開汽車之類，她都能來。最近，她已領到了出國護照，在十二月中就啓程赴美，對她自己的音樂，作更深一步的研究。希望她在國外眞正地學得一點東西回來，讓這些愛好音樂的，和影劇圈的朋友們多一份力量！</p>
<h3>真理和正義</h3>
<p>— 迂夫</p>
<p>看「左拉傳」</p>
<p>左拉的一生，很明顯的可分爲前後兩個時期。前一僩時期他生活在窮困裏，後一個時期他生活在優裕中，在前他救了娜娜。在後他救了砲兵上尉屬雷茀斯。這兩次都是他正義感的表現，但表現的方式和他當時的情感不同：在窮困的時候，他毫無考慮地，自動地救了娜娜。在生活優裕的時候，他就沒有那股衝動的勁兒了。當屈夫人來求他時，他起光只是拒絕，後是懷疑，因爲懷疑才發覺了屈雷茀斯的眞正受屈，然後才寫成了「我控訴」那篇有名的文章。</p>
<p>在這兩次正義感的對照之下，使我想到生活在貧窮困苦裏的人是更富有高貴的同情心，生活在舒泰富裕的環境裏的人，只知道自私，只知道虛偽，沒有一點憐憫心，沒有一點同情心；他們恐怕不幸會傳染到他們的身上，會打破他們幸福的生活，所以，他們寧願一天天地過着平凡的生活一直到髮白，到走進墳墓，不願爲了救別人的不幸而伸出偉大的同情之　！所以，當你不幸而想去求人的時候，你先得看淸對方的環境和他的爲人，不要冒失行事。否則，你將失敗！</p>
<p>左拉終於發覺了一個無辜的不幸者的眞情，因爲他曾經是一個窮人，所以他還有正義感。因此，他毫不猶疑地站在他的本位上暴露了强權者的黑暗，訴出了被屈辱者的不幸和痛苦，並向惡勢力挑　！</p>
<p>權者的奴才們判決了他的敗訴，盲目的羣衆向他攻擊，這不能表示他的不合潮流，也不能表示他的失去羣心，更不能表示他的錯誤！只表示了他的堅强的意志，和偉大的人格！也表示了他永遠是站在眞理的一面！</p>
<p>救世主耶穌活着的時候，是受盡了苦難的，他的命述都沒有能逃脫被釘死在十字架上，何况是左拉呢！但是，眞理永遠是眞理，它終於跟隨着正義來了！</p>
<h3>藍天</h3>
<p>— 新鳴</p>
<p>這是一個　人的消息，派拉蒙公司以三百萬美金攝成這張五彩音樂鉅片「藍天」“Blue　Skis”，因爲該片由歌王平克勞斯貝，舞　　雷亞斯坦二人再度合作（前有一歌王爭　」本市已映過），而亞斯坦在攝製的過程中，更宣佈他自此片完竣後即行吿別影壇。所以在此片中施出渾身技藝；還介紹四種新的舞式於愛好他的觀衆面前。</p>
<p>至歌王的戲，依舊脫不了原來的作風，使人陶醉的低音歌曲竟達二十一支。作曲者是鼎　大名的歐文柏林，牡丹綠葉，相得益彰。</p>
<h3>米高梅新片「情海妒潮」中二主角：股格蘭褒曼興喬治山德士。</h3>
<h3>第一部國產歌舞片　「鶯飛人間」</h3>
<p>— 胡天</p>
<p>中電二廠自復員後，已經先別人獻出了他們的第一部國產片「忠義之家」。現在，他們又將給我們看到第一部國產歌舞片「鶯飛人間」。這部片子有一個很好的主題。就是；藝術是人民大衆的，不是被少數有暇階級　之高擱的專利品。</p>
<p>故事是說：一個象牙塔里的藝術家，訓練出一個人才出衆的女歌唱家。憑了她悅耳的聲音及劇院里公開演唱，票價是相當的昂貴有很多買不起票的人，只能在劇院外面看看廣吿，在一個偶然的機會里，她碰到了一個男的窮音樂家，他希望她能够在大庭廣衆之前，無條件的唱給貧民窠里的窮人聽；她也欣然答應，並出資爲他們組織了一個歌唱團，自己也改了名字跟他們到外面對着人民大衆酒生美麗的歌聲，使她的音樂能給任何人聽到，　是劇院里的紳士們的專利品了。但是，事情給她的老師發覺，他阻止她這種佈施性的歌唱，然而他的女弟子却反抗着，因此，使他惱恨而自殺。這反而促使了她更堅決的意志，和爲窮人而歌唱的志願！</p>
<p>故事雖然是很簡單，但是導演者卻能利用很</p>
<p>多的歌舞塲面使這情節很生動。前幾天會到導演方沛霖，因此使我知道了：全劇有十二隻插曲，和八塲歌舞場面，還請了李愛雷參加演出舞蹈。我自己也曾去參觀渦他柏攝舞　塲面的幾個鏡頭，覺得佈景的確很壯麗，尤其是幾塲利用倒影的塲面。這是在一個午夜，一排十幾個女演員們，都穿着白色的舞衣，在舞　上且歌且舞，舞台下是一片水色，當燈光照得很亮的時候，水中就很明　地顯現出舞台上演員的倒影來。這眞是美極了！</p>
<p>我看過幾部美國好萊塢的五彩歌舞片，覺得人家的東西眞不錯，因爲他們的機械和技術都能够帮助他們成功。常我這次看到中國歌舞片的工作過程，覺得我們的東西是別有一種趣味：它雖然有的部份趕不上外國的東西，但是，導演者的聰敏，能利用巧妙的鏡頭，和攝取的角度，盡可能的應用目前的佈景環境和簡陋的機械，是不能不讚許的！</p>
<p>好在，這片子本星期內要給我們看到，它的成功與吾也可以讀它自己來決定了。</p>

<h3>記兩個交藝茶會</h3>
<p>— 進珊</p>
<p>這還是上星期日參加了五層樓酒家的文藝茶話之後，有幾位朋友給我出的題目，這些年來，無論敎書編刊物，我只知道出題目讓別人做文章，不曉得拈了題目做文章的痛苦；這回好，可遇着了，幸而不是當　繳卷，不然的話，準吃鴨蛋。可是吃鴨蛋拿零分沒關係，這年頭兒譙靠分數吃飯？但，這是朋友的委託，一份友情的囑付，一片熱切的期望，所以這就難了。</p>
<p>我是一個什麼都沒有學好，什麽都不懂得的人，自問勉强可以知道一點的，也只有情感二字；而半身落拓，一事無成的，也是爲了這情感二字。就拿交友而論，我就不會像有些人的你來我往，敷衍一套，所以一顆心總常被寂寞所封鎖。然而，我却相信「烏鳴嚶嚶，求其友聲」，是眞的惑情的交流，這在最近這兩個的文藝茶會中，重又感覺到而證實了的。</p>
<p>一個是「星期六文藝茶座」，談起這個茶座的發起，應該追溯到九月份春秋發表的中明先生的「文人友情與政治關係」，從那篇文章引起華林洪爲法兩先生的響應，華先生才由且體的建議而變做積極的實踐。</p>
<p>有一天華先生興冲冲的跑來、劈頭一句話，就是「有了，有了，我現在找到地方了一香雪園！」當然我很了解華先生的熱忱和經騐，戰前在南京辦「文藝俱樂部」，戰時在重慶辦「星期六晚茶」。於是我們就商量到邀約朋友和發佈消息。</p>
<p>險了幾天徐仲年先生來談起恢復「文藝茶話會」的事，我就把華先生的計劃吿訴了他，他也知道了，他說：「恰巧兩個茶會的時間地點都不同，正好並行不悖。」我想，對啦，大家在上海不正苦着　朋友不方便，這樣多幾次見面的機會不更好嗎？於是我們又爲這個茶會商量着邀約明友和發佈請柬。</p>
<p>過了幾天，華先生寄來了第一次茶座的代柬，我照樣在星期六的春秋上登出了。</p>
<p>十月十九日下午我去參加，香雪園原來是一座竹籬茅舍的建築，位置在一所療養院的花園一角，廳上正中是吳稚暉先生寫的「文藝茶座」，門口就是周煉霞女士的那付「伹使兩心相照無燈無月何妨」的對聯，屋頂高懸着古典的紗燈，窗外美人蕉帶着三分憔悴，紛披的開放在西風斜陽衷，參加者人各淸茶一杯，細細的啜飲，領略着鬧中取靜的滋味。也許由於建築和設備，都當有東方農村情調，令人想到的是紅樓夢中的稻香村，成瘦西湖上的綠楊村一類的情境。可惜的只缺少一灣流水，幾聲款乃而已。</p>
<p>那天我走得早，我看到的有劉海粟，美　熙，朱應　，關良，鍾憲民諸先生和主持人華林先生等，大家自由聚談，不拘形跡。談文，談畫，談人，談鬼，…</p>
<p>第二次是十月二十六日，這次參加的有施蟄存，戴望舒，許士騏，黄幻吾，劉獅先生等和孫福熙先生華林先生，難得的是語絲創辦人之一的章川島先生恰巧在上海，他和李小峯先生同來。</p>
<p>常然，又是一片友情的交流，幽默的風趣，熱情的問訊，有說有笑的，直到夕陽西下，黄昏漸漸龍上窗紗，大家都似乎覺得還沒有暢盡。但是第二天我們還可以在文藝茶話會上面。大家心衷都這探想着，慢慢散去。</p>
<h3>洛神</h3>
<p>— 明　仇十洲</p>
<p>「文藝茶話會」的恢復的可算是仲年先生一個人的籌備，正同文藝茶座是華先生獨自經營的一樣；就我所知道的，他就足足的奔走了三個多星期，連春秋上登的代柬，也是仲年先生的手筆。雖然，他在會塲上特別介紹常年淺草社陳承蔭先生接洽功勞，更追溯到十四年前孫福熙先生的發起，說是春苔先生闖下來的禍，還感謝到這次春秋的刋登請柬。</p>
<p>五層樓酒家完全是現代化的設備，高　的鋼窗上垂着米黄色的綢幕，墨綠絲絨的軟椅，光滑的地板，而參加者的熱烈與悠閑的情調却和在香雪園並無二致。這天擁擠得　乎使後來者無插足餘地。</p>
<p>座中孫福熙先生以原始闖禍人的身份，報吿了他十年離別，流亡大後方的幾個雋永而幽默的故事。華林先生講到人生的三個時期，幼小時期愛父母，成年以後愛情人，中年老年愛朋友，說明人類最可寳貴的還是友情，政治只是國民對國家的一種責任而已；因此希望大家常參加，一起做個好朋友。他這話恰巧回應到中明先生的文章。眞的，你看在這塲合，無論新朋舊友，彼此握手　笑，誰不莫逆於心呢？</p>
<p>座上汪亞廖先生伉儷，還有徐蔚南先生都因事先走了，嚴獨鶴先生老是瞇瞇的笑着，馬公愚先生一邊談着一邊燃着鬍鬚。</p>
<p>那天最後劉獅先生還沉痛的報吿了陳抱一先生的身後蕭條，許嘯天先生首光表示了深切的關懷，一時大家却興　了無限同情，準備着設法救濟潰族。</p>
<p>在座有鬚髮蒼白的長者，也有不修篇幅的名士；有瀟　出塵的畫師，也有西裝整潔的作家；有雍容華貴的婦人，也有倩影亭亭的少女；有馳名文壇的前輩，也有愛好文藝的靑年：不同的身份，不問的服飾，在共同的文藝氣氛中，自然的調和了。我相信當每個人散出會塲的時候，心裏都充滿了自由，和諧與愉快。…</p>
<p>—寫到這兒再從頭看一遍，才知道念就之草，只拉拉雜雜寫了一些膚淺的印象，我想，這兩個茶會，假如能有趙景深先生在塲，用他生動的筆調替我們寫篇文章，準會比這兒粗略的記述要高明得多。怎麽辦呢？我還是繳不了卷的。但是，繳不了卷事小，　負了朋友們的囑託和期望，那才糟呢。—好吧，且讓它發表出去，也好給外地關心我們的朋友先知道一點梗槪。</p>
<h3>街頭小景</h3>
<p>— 葉紅</p>
<p>早上八點多鐘，電車站上已經佇立着二十歲個人。</p>
<p>大家焦灼地候着電車來，差不多都伸長了　子，將視綫投到遠處去，然而，老半天還看不見電車的影子。</p>
<p>天空是灰暗的，看樣子要下雨了。</p>
<p>一輛小吉普載着幾個花花綠綠的女人飛駛過來，掠過一陣「香風」，小吉普絕塵而去。</p>
<p>終於，一輛無軌電車像甲蟲似的慢慢地爬來，離開丈把遠，已經瞧得見車廂裏塞滿了人。</p>
<p>電車一到站頭，在車門口那個不帶帽子的賣票員剛要把哨子吹，裏而就有幾個兵老爺大吼着</p>
<p>「開門，快開門！」</p>
<p>賣票員奈何不得，只得把車門一開，等到那幾個兵老爺衝下來後，站頭上的人就像搶黄金似的一窩蜂擬上去…</p>
<p>賣票的立即施出混身解數，手脚口並用，拼命的推着車門，一面放開了喉嚨大喊：</p>
<p>「勿要窮兇極惡好哦？自家看看還軋不軋得落？」</p>
<p>搶着擁上去的人好像沒聽見，依然埋頭苦幹」地衝上去…</p>
<p>突然車廂　有人哭喊起來：</p>
<p>「鈔票　去了啊！鈔票　去了啊！」</p>
<p>一個光頭的小夥子擠了下來，手中提個一只「空空如也」的帆布書包，帶哭帶喊的：</p>
<p>「捉　手啊！」</p>
<p>站頭上一個老頭兒忙走過來，怪關心的：</p>
<p>「多少錢給去了？」</p>
<p>「八十萬，八十萬塊，哇——」小夥子就放聲大哭起來。</p>
<p>老頭兒理着鬍子：「唉！這成什麼世界！」</p>
<p>那個賣票的冷笑一聲：</p>
<p>「哭，哭有什麼用，　手難道等着你嗎？還不快回去吿訴老板！」說着握起拳頭，在車門　用勁的捶了兩下，大喊一聲：</p>
<p>「開啦！」</p>
<p>電車剛要開動，車門邊還　着兩個人。</p>
<p>「等下一部好不好？」賣票的一面緊推車門。</p>
<p>那兩僩人不理，照樣攣着。</p>
<p>這一下，惹得賣票的勃然大怒，使出全身氣力把車門一推：「拍搭！」</p>
<p>過了好久好久，又來了一部，站頭海沒到，車裏的賣票員已把哨子吹得震天響，電車飛快的駛過去。</p>
<p>站頭上的人愈來愈多，天空益發陰暗，快下雨了。</p>
<h3>巴爾扎克吃畫餅</h3>
<p>法國寫實主義的創始者巴爾扎克（Hoporede　Balzac　1799－1850），他又是一個有名的想像家。據說他年靑的時候，每天只吃一些水泡的麵包，但並不以爲苦。他又常常川粉筆在桌子上畫些他想吃的糕餅食物，酒性一來時，他就大嚼特嚼，他的心情便好像正在吃着山珍海味了。</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血　　81</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>我一看手錶，已經六點多鐘了，這才稍稍整理自己，把虎弟喚醇，吿訴他這裏的情形，間他可要再吃點什麼。他睡眼惶忪了一會，才搖搖頭，在刺鼻孔。我知道這是油烟的功效；呌他快點料理一下，趕快離開這裏。凑巧那老侉的女人，這時一步跨了進來，拍手笑着說：「你這兩位哥兒，昨日敢情是幹什麼去了吧」？她說她進來過兩三次，見我們睡得正甜，沒敢打攪；又問我們還是上廳用飯，還是讓她給作點什麽吃吃。我們吿訴她要出去蹓躂一下，如有公事，還得趕進城去。</p>
<p>我們經過廚房，走到「招賢堂」的隔輩甬道裏、身上覺得一凉，鼻孔也通了空氣，心卞舒暢得多。甬道裏有兩扇紙糊窗格，通着招賢堂大廳，窗格的紙，破了很多小洞，　衷人聲嗡嗡，大嚷小呌，噪成一片，都從這裏傳了出來。走到窗前，我們順便向內張張，剛把眼睛凑上去，却有一陣惡臭　了出來—大烟，香烟，汗氣，人吳、同時夾着一種說不出怪氣味！</p>
<p>這窗洞，只看得出大　的一雙角，　　這雙角上的種種切切，我想但　描寫的　　　情　沒有這樣　人。男的：日人，韓人，中國人，都有一個個不是兇神惡煞的樣予、便是中了毒的一副　居餘氣；女的，如其眞有羅剎國，我想她們都是羅剎國移殖過來的。至於行動的下流，混賬，也無法說得淸楚。這大槪就是一間活地獄，也大槪就是日寇替漢奸走狗們造成的一種天堂吧！</p>
<p>我們想把廳　的人類，分析一下，作個統計比較，虎弟忽然遞了暗號過來；原來廚房　有人托着一大太盤湯菜，從這裏經過。我剛當朗裝作沒事似的，出了甬道。</p>
<p>從老第到　街區大本營內，要走大路，必得回頭走到圓拱門那裏，再進對鎖入口。因想到那入口內，必有森嚴的守衛，我們於是準備走老寨後院，設法過去。定了定方向，我們沿　老寨邊沿一帶平房後背走着。這時天色已黑，我們却是一路小心　避，探索着前進。老　司大本營之間有各種否同的　碍隔斷，有的是一　多高士　，有的是　層　棘藜絲網，當中夾着荆　，也有七八尺高，荆棘佈置得很　，看不見那一而的東西。這　僅有一　　　的小　，沿街都是瓦　　石　　，好　從來沒有人踐踏渦似的。</p>
<p>到了老寨後身，却是一片亂林，荒蕪不堪，好像是一塊亂塚，高低不平，地上長滿了　棘，野藤，亂草，簡直沒法插脚。虎弟建議，讓他揀　樹，爬到頂上，看個大槪，再作計劃。但我這時却打算寗可試試大路；因我預測，這一帶恐怕根本走不過去。縱然　越這些障碍、那一邊還不嘵得是些什麼　形呢。可是上樹看着，也無不可。</p>
<p>虎弟稍稍結束了一下，揀了一　較高的樹爬了上去。好一會才下米，吿訴我說，單怕這邊跨不過去，要是跨過了河些障碍，那邊祇有一條丈來寬的　水，對岸　有石牆，只有一人高，都是容易過去。他說他看見入口的大路上，經過遵　必得走過一座橋；恐怕那　上守衖很嚴，不易待遇。</p>
<p>我　躇了一下、又同虎弟商量丁一會，還是決定翻過　　障碍試試看。因爲，根據防衛方式，凡是障碍愈險的所在，防衛必不嚴緊。只要　服這層障碍，就是大路。我也結束了一下，把身遇小劍抽出，遞給虎弟，讓他前面開道，因他眼睛尖利，　賣　　　有功夫。就　　安　、仍　把　服劃破　處　手背也剌了幾條小口，足足花費了半例小時，好容易才穿透了這重障碍。　弟把劍交選給我，說這小劍，比他從日寇那　得來的那柄小橘子，還鐵利得多。</p>

<h3>復</h3>
<p>— 少夫</p>
<p>大概是因爲我常常引用聖經上語句的關係，有很多讀者來函詢問我是不是基督徒，這里，我可以答復這些熱心朋友的，我是個基督徒，但在離開學校後，絕未進過一次教堂，與教會絲毫無來往，我是一個教養的崇拜者，也可以說，對於聖經的研究頗有興趣。興趣所在，一是哲學上的，一是文學上的。因爲這本書是哲學的，也是文學的（尤其是詩篇）</p>
<p>同時，又有讀者來函，說本刊　「揄揚基督教作品，對於佛教，每多吹求譏斥」等等，這却決非事實了。如果說對佛教經典甚少引用介紹則有之，那是因爲我的不理解，不敢作外行的談論，以貽笑大方，至於「吹求譏斥」，不但保證過去没有，且可保證未來也決不會有。</p>
<p>宗教信仰自由，今日誰也不應有偏狹的成見，强人同信了。而且，任何一種宗教，它的基本信念——向善，都是相同。因之，如果因信耶而反佛，或因信佛而反耶，都不是最賢明的恢宏的心胸。</p>
<p>卅三年夏季，在重慶，曾去北碚　雲山訪問過太盧上人，他那種澹泊寗靜的氣度，我雖不是佛門弟子，令我今日仍縈系腦際，我知道那是深湛的宗教教養所致。這個印象，曾不斷地激動我，誘致我研究經典。</p>
<p>據實答復如上，不知這些熱心的朋友們能諒解否？</p>
<p>大人童話</p>
<h3>原形出現</h3>
<p>— 文華</p>
<p>據說歐州現正流傳着下面的一個笑話：</p>
<p>某一次有一隻客機載着不少的旅客，各有不同的國籍，在大西洋上飛行，航行途中一部份機件忽然損壞，無法修復，於是飛機師即刻宣佈必須減輕機上的重量，否則無法抵達安全地，於是這些旅客們只得將全部的行李和郵包犧牲，一一擲入海中，然而載重仍舊過重，飛機下沈，至此一位法國人便即刻立了起來，發表一篇辭令漂亮，感情熱烈的演說，大意說爲了全體乘客的安全和幸福，以及人類的博愛，應該有人犧牲自己，從飛機上跳下去，以拯救他人，然而本着自由平等的精神，這裏幾位英雄應該不是强迫的，而自動地走出來完成這個偉業，這時一位日本客人聽見了自殺，大爲感動，馬上毫不遲疑的走上前去開了門，高呼一聲「天皇萬歲！」就踴身跳下去了。</p>
<p>第二個是德國人，也高呼了一聲「希特勒萬歲！」(Hail,Hltlerl)就跳了下去了，然而到了下面却拉開了一面降落傘。</p>
<p>接着一位意大利客人高呼了一聲「墨索里尼萬歲！」走到了門邊却躊躇再三跳不下去了，旁邊走上一位英國紳士，念了一句「上帝保佑我王！」一伸手將意大利人推下去了。</p>
<p>自此以後再没有人自告奮勇，然而飛機却仍然向下沈，非得還要減輕重量不可，於是大家聚在一堆開起會議來，在再三商討之下，決定誰的身體最重就誰下去，這時大個子的俄國人馬上退出來高呼「否決！」（Vets!）拒不同意。</p>
<p>大家正在面面相覷毫無辦法的時候，一位美國人突然很慷慨的立起來說：「誰願意跳下去的，我願意付與美金一千元！」這時那個猶太人聽見了馬上立起來說：「如果你能給付二千元，而且是現款（in　cash）我自願下去。」美國人正大高興，急忙掏出皮夾來付款時，旁邊角落裏直到現在還未響過的一位中國商人，却悄悄的伸出手來對那猶太人說：「我想你既然就要跳下去了，這筆錢還是交給我保管罷！」</p>

<p>最新曆法　現行陽曆，極不整齊，似無紀律，有失「曆」字的意義。現在來建議一種曆法：</p>
<p>一年仍分四季；</p>
<p>每季三個月，全年十二個月；</p>
<p>十二個月中：六個單月：一，三，五，七，九，十一等月；六個雙月：二，四，六，八，十，十二等月；</p>
<p>單月每月卅一日（單月單數）大月；</p>
<p>雙月每月三十日（雙月雙數）小月。</p>
<p>全年三百六十六天（標準年，其實即現稱之閏年）</p>
<p>尋常年則於正月減少一天，</p>
<p>標準年的元旦謂之標準日；</p>
<p>每年的七月一日；適處上下半年的正中心，得謂之「中正日」。一年四季的名稱爲春，夏，秋，冬。</p>
<p>現在的陽曆，春季在十二月，一月，二月，夏季在三月，四月，五月；秋季在六月，七月，八月；冬季在九月，十月，十一月。又破壞了季的紀律，精神，和意義。可將現在的月份一律提前一個月，二月改作一月，餘類推，如此則春爲一月，二月，三月，夏爲四月，五月，六月；秋爲七月，八月，九月；冬爲十月，十一月，十二月。或者將英文的月名釋義改一改：Deccinber是一月，餘類推，而Noveinb　year　三十日却變了大除夕（End　of　the　year）</p>
<p>標準年的標準日適又逢到星期一者，每二十八年中輪值四次，但能與星期輪值表配合者，祇有一年，這一年又顯然成了四個標準年的魁首，得謂之「統一年」。</p>
<p>將現行曆法，如此修改，既遷就現實，計算又極科學，更易於記憶，現在姑名之爲：「紀律化的新陽曆」，還希望它將來成爲「New　World　Calendar」，如有擅長英文者，更希望能譯寄外國雜誌報章，提供給大家討論討論。</p>
<h3>萬年如一</h3>
<p>— 吾悠</p>
<p>記得在中學校的時候，一個晚會上與同學們討論改革曆法的問題，當時我曾異想天開地提出了個新奇的「新曆法」。簡要說起來，這個「新曆法」是這樣的：</p>
<p>一年分爲四季；每季三個月；每月三「週」；每「週」十日。（取消星期制，「星期」這名詞事實上自然已經不能適用了，就是「週」也欠妥，道名稱尚待另定。）一年本是三百六十五天零幾小時又若干分鐘，上面的十二個月祇佔了三百六十天，還剩餘的五天有零，不屬於任何一個月，這樣安排：以四天分别排在四季之首，定名爲「春季日」，「夏季日」，「秋季日」，和「冬季日」；還有一天有零，放在年末，定名爲「年終日」。</p>
<p>這個「新曆法」的理由與優點我也能勉强提出很多，茲簡述其較重要的如后：</p>
<p>第一，固定，没有例外，萬年如一，簡單明瞭，容易計算。第二，適合於人事上的一般習慣與需要，每一季與每年終都有一個空白的日子，　然獨立，效用很大。（原則上，「X季日」與「年終日」都是休息的日子，可用來作爲檢討與清算過去一階段，計劃與預算將來一階段，毫不牽連常日。）第三，七天一次休息的星期日，改成十天在「週末日」休息一次；新年因爲有一個「週末日」一個「年終日」和一個「春季日」三天例假日連在一起，也不必另放年假了；其他同樣情形的還很多；這樣對於「效率」裨益至多，例如，由初小到大學卒業的時間，就可以從十六年（指我國現行學校制度）縮短爲十五年；他如行政效率及工業生產率等等，皆以此類推。</p>
<p>這個所謂「新曆法」，新則新矣，惜乎太乏學理根據，不知對否？</p>
<h3>我想出嫁！</h3>
<p>— 任</p>
<p>青年問題</p>
<p>我並不是想，在　　做一個徵婚廣告，用這方法來得到一個婚姻對象。我郤相信目前遭遇到和我同樣困難的女子一定很多，決不只我一人。因此我想把這久蓄在我胸頭，不能解決的問題提出來討論。</p>
<p>我是一個廿五歲的未婚女子，按照「女大當嫁」的古訓，該是結婚的時候了。但異乎尋常的，是我不抱獨身主義，極想結婚，而有生以來從未得到一個可以考慮的結婚機會。早上看報，每天看見有訂婚結婚的啓事；獨有我，在人羣裏而　被棄在人羣外，永久找不到有這樣可能的一個機會。講教育，我是個高中畢業生，總算是智識份子，論體格，我很强壯，說面貌，亦並不一定比不上一般有結婚幸運的人。我實不懂了，我就從没有人要同我結婚。</p>
<p>現在的婚姻方式，隨着時代改進了，是個「父母不命，媒妁無言」的時期。舊式廢去了，顯然的還没有普遍的新方式，可以代替。中國還不曾到「女兒十六就初次介紹入社會」的文明地步，必需自己努力。父母不　　了女兒己成年，到處托人做媒，自己又那能見了朋友便說，請介紹幾個男朋友給我，讓我有個結婚的機會？」和我處在同一苦悶中的一羣，和我年齡相仿，環境大同小異的人很多，在等待　結婚。可是大家在言語間　　如深而精神上都是心照不宣。</p>
<p>我絕不是以女子除了結婚没有别的路可走的那些人，也不是把女子結婚看做「出路」；但我自己（和我同樣的女子想來亦不少）是無論如何不願做老小姐的。不做老小姐只有出嫁，出嫁一定要有一個對象，我該到那裏去找對象？</p>
<p>有人或者會說出去做做事，自然而然多認識些人了，不就有了機會？可是上海有多少機關可以供一個高中畢業的女子去爭取呢，除了小學教員同做女打字員之外；而這種機關裏，若不是女多於男必是男職員大多數是已婚了的。曾讀過本年九月份　Coronet　上的「怎樣找丈夫」一文，但該文所述對於中國不適用。我要出嫁，但我郤被環境逼着走上可怕的「老小姐」路上，該如何是好呢？</p>
<p>上海內幕</p>
<h3>舞女及舞廳　　4</h3>
<p>— 嘉謨</p>
<p>一般的舞女，她們的進項自然比不上紅星們，這其間的差額之大是足令局外人爲之咋舌的。普通的舞女，（指二三等舞場坐位子而生意得過去的而言），她們平均每月的進款約在一百萬元至一百五十萬元之　。門庭冷落的黑星，每月就祇有三四十萬元。而最淒涼的桂花舞女，每月竟有在十萬元之內的。她們並無月薪或什麼底薪。也没有什麼生活指數可以根據。她們的收入就是舞票的折兑額與客人另給的現金。茲就查訪所及列表如下以明之：</p>
<p>（級别）　（坐位别）　（舞場别）　（每月進項平均數）</p>
<p>一組紅星　不坐位者　一等舞場　八百萬元以上</p>
<p>二級紅星　不坐位者　一等舞場　五百萬元以上</p>
<p>二級紅星　不坐位者　二等舞場　六百萬元以上</p>
<p>三級紅星　不坐位者　二等舞場　一百萬元以上</p>
<p>三級紅星　不坐位者　三等舞場　二百萬元以上</p>
<p>一級舞星　坐位者　一等舞場　一百萬元左右</p>
<p>一級舞星　坐位者　二等舞場　二百萬元以上</p>
<p>二級舞星　坐位者　二等舞場　一百萬元以上</p>
<p>三級舞星　坐位者　二等舞場　八十萬元以下</p>
<p>四級舞星　坐位者　三等舞場　四十萬元以下</p>
<p>黑星　坐位者　三等舞場　十五萬元以下</p>
<p>依照上表，我們發見一個很奇特的例子，就是「不坐位子」的三級（起碼）紅星，其進款往往不如坐位子的舞女。而且二等舞廳坐位子的一級舞女，其平均進款亦反而超過在一等舞場的姊妹。這原因是逛一等舞場的舞客大都自備舞伴，否則就呌紅星坐檯，致坐位子的舞星反而生路缺缺，倒比不到二等舞場的坐位子舞星左右逢源，而舞客又都是踴躍輸將的單身漢。</p>
<p>那些在二三等舞場裏不得意的舞女，她們時常以跑碼頭爲其求生的出路。但自南京杭州禁舞以後，她們又聯袂狼狽回　。目下唯一的外碼頭祇有香港一處。而且盤費生活費都須有充足的準備。（約需國幣一百萬元左右）所以出碼頭的也就不多了。</p>
<p>那些有紅星資格的舞女，她們生活在試誘這環境中。因此變愛事件層出不窮，嫁人或與人同居者也隨時可以發現。她們時常是突然宣告失踪，原來是退藏於有錢人的金屋裏去了。同時後起之秀又不斷地從小舞場裡爬上來。「長江後浪推前浪」新舞女是不斷在生長着。舊舞女是不斷地在向上爬，不斷地蜕變着。這樣造成了上海的畸形的女子新職業。這樣造成了上海的醉生夢死的色情配給所的舞業繁榮。（完）</p>

<p>Trial of Traitor Zhou Fohai Concluded; Interrogation Lasted Six Hours; Sentencing Scheduled for the 7th [Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 2nd] Traitor Zhou Fohai was tried again on the 2nd. From early morning, Chao Tian Gong was bustling with activity, with police and soldiers maintaining order. Except for those with passes who could enter the courtroom, over ten thousand spectators gathered on the steps of the Dacheng Hall, listening to the proceedings through loudspeakers. At 8:05 AM, traitor Zhou was brought in, wearing a narrow-striped taupe-gray gabardine jacket, light blue Chinese-style pants, gray socks, and round-toed leather shoes, sitting in the waiting room reading a newspaper. At 9:00 AM, defense lawyers Zhang Shizhao, Wang Shanxiang, and Yang Jialin arrived together. The court session began at 9:00 AM and concluded at 3:00 PM, with sentencing scheduled for the 7th. Court President Questioned Sternly; Traitor Zhou Still Denied Selling Out the Country and Being a Traitor After the court session began, Presiding Judge Zhao Chen, along with Judges Ge Zhisheng and Jin Shanding, and Prosecutor Chen Shengzu, and female clerk Huang Qianju took the bench and brought traitor Zhou to the court. First, they questioned him about his crimes of issuing counterfeit currency, disrupting finances, resisting legal tender, and demeaning national banks, using documents from the puppet government and his personal statements. Zhou remained silent. Then, they interrogated him about organizing the puppet government, publishing fallacies, and signing the "Sino-Japanese Basic Treaty." Zhou vaguely stated: "We didn't form the government as a game, we had to have something to gain, we had to have harmony before we did it; after joining the enemy, I knew I was facing death, and you can't die more than once, so I decided to do something for the country and the people. I was initially hesitant, but once I did it, I didn't shirk responsibility. I'm not responsible for signing the 'Sino-Japanese Basic Treaty,' but I did consider it, and it wouldn't affect national sovereignty. The puppet government was fake, so the treaty was naturally fake as well. I'm not out of my mind, and I don't admit to selling out the country and being a traitor." Favorable Evidence The court then investigated the results of the investigation into favorable evidence and questioned him about them one by one. Zhou confessed: "After the puppet government was established, seeing that the Japanese were still fighting wildly, and Wang Zhaoming was a pitiful puppet, I knew my actions were wrong and thought about doing something to serve the country." The facts show a letter from Du Yuesheng stating: Zhou had entrusted Li Botao and Duan Honggang to ask them to request his surrender in the 30th year of the Republic. A letter from Ma Yuanfang stated: He was released after being arrested because Zhou found a way, but he said: "I (Mr. Ma) originally did not dare to affect the public affairs of the nation with personal matters." Letters from Wu Shaoshu and Jiang Bocheng stated: Zhou had found a way to assist in concealing work. A reply from Wu Kaixian stated: After being arrested, Zhou found a way to have him detained in Nanjing and then found a way to release him. A letter from Li Mingyang stated: After being captured and imprisoned in Lieutenant Colonel Ishikawa's house in Shanghai, Zhou found a way to rescue him. A letter from Gu Zhutong stated: In the autumn of the 33rd year of the Republic, Zhou contacted the Third War Area to coordinate a counteroffensive. It is true that he assisted in the takeover work after the Japanese surrender. A letter from Chen Baohua stated: Zhou had concealed his work and asked him to take a letter to Chen Bulei, Chen Guofu, Chen Lifu, and Shao Lizi. A document from the Military Intelligence Bureau stated that his work: "Since being contacted by Cheng Kexiang and Peng Suli and approved for use, there were no initial achievements. Later, after the bureau strengthened its use in many ways, it gradually had confidence in the central government." Zhou vigorously defended himself, saying: "After receiving the handwritten letter from the late Director, I actively made atonement for my sins and began to make arrangements, so there was a lack of achievements. Later, I installed a radio station in Yang Xinghua's and my own private residence, and concealed and supplied military and economic intelligence, and truly fulfilled my mission. If the Military Intelligence Bureau has anything to say, please summon Cheng Kexiang." Two-Faced Policy Then, after describing the case of the murder of Li Shiqun, the court pointed out various illegal and disturbing acts committed by him after his so-called surrender, and the acts of undermining the government, based on various puppet documents. Zhou either argued sophistically or claimed that it was a smokescreen necessary for his work, and insisted that he was not responsible for clearing the countryside and waging actual war against Britain and the United States. The court questioned: "All your actions can be said to be a 'two-faced policy'." Zhou quickly replied: "Taking risks is not a game, and if it can still be said to be a 'two-faced policy', I am not convinced." The court then questioned: "Since you are not afraid of death, why didn't you serve in Chongqing and resist Japan?" Zhou replied weakly: "This is the sacrifice of the initial mistake. I deeply regret it. For the sake of the country, even the reputation of my ancestors and descendants has been sacrificed. Even now I am still called a traitor. I am not reconciled even in death." The court further questioned: "Looking at your history, you went from the Communist Party to the Kuomintang in Guangzhou, then rode the fence in Hankou, then went to Shanghai to be a puppet official in Chongqing, and in the puppet government you came over to be a special agent. It can truly be said that you are 'talented and adaptable'." Zhou then lowered his head and said nothing.渝 Garrison Commander's Residence Burglarized Valuable Items Missing [Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 2nd] Two leather suitcases and many other valuable items were stolen from the residence of Chongqing Garrison Commander Sun Yuanliang in Shangqing Temple on the 31st of last month. It is said that on the night of the burglary, Commander Sun's wife was in the countryside for some business, and no one was taking care of the house, so it was taken advantage of by thieves. After this case occurred, many people in various circles thought it was talk data and were amazed. Four Counts Summarized; Prosecutor Requested the Harshest Sentence At 11:11 AM, Lawyer Wang Shanxiang stood up and said: "Two replies from the Military Intelligence Bureau of the Organization Department have not yet arrived. They concern contact with the Central Statistics Bureau and those who surrendered. Should we begin the debate? Please consider." The court ruled: "This court has already obtained indirect evidence of these two matters. Commander Gu has already replied. There is no need to wait any longer. The investigation of this case is concluded. Begin the debate." First, Prosecutor Chen stated his military situation according to the indictment, and then summarized it into four points: (1) Zhou's claim that he organized the puppet government to serve the country and benefit the people was actually harming the country and the people, a ridiculous crime of violating national policy; (2) the conditions for surrender did not meet the legal requirements; (3) acting as a special agent was a repeated flattery and opportunism; (4) after the enemy surrendered, he did not escape and serve the central government. He hopes to reduce his sentence with a small effort. Finally, he said: "The defendant's crime is serious. I represent the people of the country and should ask the presiding judge to maintain discipline for the country and preserve the righteousness of the nation and give him a severe sentence." Zhou's Defense At 11:40 AM, Zhou defended himself vigorously, distorting his actions as reducing the suffering of the people, without affecting the country, and that he had restrained the enemy's actions in many ways and assisted in the war of resistance. and emphasized his achievements as a special agent and the process of his surrender, and deeply "regretted" the court's "treating him favorably where he could be forgiven, only discussing politics and not law when it was favorable, and only discussing law and not politics when it was unfavorable, and only asking about motives and not actions when it was beneficial to his meritorious deeds, and only asking about actions and not motives when it was not beneficial, and erasing his loyalty and hard work with one stroke." The court presented a reply recently received from the Military Intelligence Bureau's closing office, which stated: "The claim that he had surrendered to the central government has not been found to be true after investigation." After hearing this, Zhou said helplessly: "Then there is no way!" Lawyers' Arguments Lawyer Zhang Shizhao then argued three points: (1) The word "approved" on the Military Intelligence Bureau's document includes approving his surrender, otherwise, why would he be ordered to work? (2) Cheng Kexiang was the one who did not work hard, and he has now been detained; (3) The Military Intelligence Bureau should reward and punish accordingly since it ordered him to work. Zhang also listed many historical examples, all of which requested a reduced sentence. Lawyer Wang Shanxiang also cited Article 57, Paragraph 10 of the Criminal Code, "If the attitude after the crime is repentance, the sentence should be reduced." "Please, the court, base on reasonable and definite favorable evidence, give a reduced sentence, in order to show credibility to the puppet troops who are working for the country's tribulation." Lawyer Yang Shanlin then presented a copy of Cheng Kexiang's report on inciting rebellion to the court, saying: It was handed over by the defendant's family, requesting "quantifying the law and considering the circumstances, and reducing the sentence." Taking Out of Context After the lawyers finished their arguments, Prosecutor Chen then defended Zhang Shizhao's first point; the original text in the investigation opinion of the document was "approved to incite and use," and "approved to surrender" cannot be taken out of context. Afterwards, Presiding Judge asked Zhou if he had anything to say? Zhou shouted "I have something to say, I'm not in a good mood, I won't say it!" After a while, he pointed to the lower couplet of the couplet in the courtroom and exclaimed: "Clear punishments and compassionate punishments", what is the meaning of killing people, death doesn't matter, but you can't talk about loyalty, if you are guilty, you should be sentenced, and you shouldn't erase your merits, unless you are Jie and Qin Shihuang, only then you are so arbitrary. In the future, the country will inevitably have internal strife and foreign troubles. If the law does not distinguish between merit and demerit, who will turn back if they take a wrong step? Zhou then commented on the political situation after the liberation of the Philippines, and even gave a big speech on democracy, and a small number of audience members who didn't understand it actually shouted and applauded. At 2:45, after the court clerk finished reading, Zhou signed and sealed, and the court ruled "The debate in this case is concluded, and the sentence will be announced at 9:00 AM on the 7th." Activities are Useless At this point, President Zhao put on a solemn expression and said: "Finally, the President of the Court has a few words to say. The defendant must listen carefully, and the family members must listen carefully: Recently, I heard that your family members have used a lot of gold bars and have been running around in many ways. This is useless. I hope you don't use money to conduct activities. You must know that the judges of this court cannot be moved by poverty, cannot be subdued by power, and cannot be moved by money and emotion. No matter what, we will decide to make a fair judgment, and all activities are superfluous." Zhou repeatedly said "This is not true." The court ruled: "It's good if this is not true. The defendant is taken back into custody." At this time, it was exactly 3:00, and the hungry audience members dispersed like a receding tide. Investigating Traitor Li Xinghua; Traitor Zhou Was Summoned to Testify [Central News Agency, Nanjing, 2nd] The High Court of the capital opened an investigation court at 4:00 PM today, and specially summoned traitor Zhou Fohai to testify, one for the case of traitor Yang Xinghua, who had confessed to introducing Peng Shou as traitor Zhou's secretary to conceal his underground work. Zhou testified: It was true. One was for Shen Changgeng's accusation that traitor Zhou presided over the puppet securities exchange, which was harmful to the people. Zhou defended the business of the puppet securities exchange. The interrogation concluded at 5:10 PM and he was taken back into custody. Traitor Qian Daosun Sentenced to Ten Years [Central News Agency, Beiping, 2nd] Qian Daosun, the president of the puppet Peking University, was sentenced to ten years in prison and deprived of his civil rights for six years by the Hebei High Court today. Taipei White Day Robbery Case; All Criminals Arrested [Central News Agency, Taipei, 1st] The major case of the robbery of 300,000 Taiwan dollars from the Changhua Bank here on the 31st of October was solved by the City Police Department within ten hours. Of the five criminals, except for the ringleader Jian Liang, who was shot dead on the spot, all the rest were captured. According to their confession, the case of the daylight robbery of 100,000 Taiwan dollars of public funds from the Monopoly Bureau in July was also committed by them. Executive Yuan Shanghai Branch Established Working Plan Committee; Subdivided into Three Groups to Handle Transportation, Industry, and Post-War Affairs [This City News] The Executive Yuan Shanghai Branch, in order to promote post-war reconstruction work in Shanghai, specially convened relevant agencies to discuss methods. The first meeting was held yesterday, and it was decided to establish the Executive Yuan Shanghai Branch Post-War Reconstruction Working Plan Committee, which will be jointly drafted by Liu Hongsheng, Wang Renlin, Zhao Zukang, and the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) representative Nush to establish the committee's regulations, the key points being: (1) Named the Shanghai Branch Post-War Reconstruction Working Plan Committee of the Executive Yuan's Post-War Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, attached to the Shanghai Branch. (2) Established a committee of nine to fifteen members, organized by representatives dispatched by relevant agencies in this city, one to two from the Public Works Bureau, one to two from the Works Bureau, two to three from the Industrial Association, one to two from the UNRRA Office, and three to five from the Shanghai Branch. (3) The post-war reconstruction work to be handled is divided into three major categories: First, post-war reconstruction of transportation, including repairing bridges, building roads, building dikes, and expanding ferry services; Second, post-war reconstruction of industry, restoring and expanding public utilities and major factories damaged during the war; Third, post-war reconstruction of agriculture, helping farmers and fishermen, increasing agricultural and fishery production, and improving seeds and fertilizers. (4) Established three groups: consultation, design, and distribution. Recess Today; National Federation of Commerce Held a Grand Meeting Yesterday; National Sentiment Fully Displayed; Hunan Representative Proposed to Stop Japanese Ships from Entering the Country [Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 2nd] The National Federation of Commerce held its second meeting at 9:00 AM on the 2nd, and continued to listen to reports from various representatives. When representatives from the Northeast, who had been separated from the motherland for fourteen years, and representatives from Taiwan, who had been separated from the motherland for fifty-one years, took the stage to report, thunderous applause came from all corners. When compatriots from Xinjiang, Ningxia, other border provinces, the Philippines, Vietnam, and other places reported, they also won a lot of applause. The meeting place was always filled with a strong atmosphere of unity, and national sentiment was brought to the peak. Some representatives even demanded action against the fact that the Northeast and Taiwan had returned to the motherland, while Hong Kong had not yet been recovered. The Hunan representative made a temporary motion requesting the government to strictly stop Japanese ships from entering Shanghai and Hong Kong ports without authorization. Until the afternoon, a representative from the Tumote Special Banner rushed from Suiyuan, and the atmosphere of great unity was rare in recent years. The meeting adjourned at about 1:00 PM in the afternoon. In the afternoon, nine groups were held to conduct reviews, one group for industrial and commercial laws, two groups for industry and mining, three groups for commerce, four groups for export trade, five groups for finance, six groups for transportation, seven groups for donations and taxes, eight groups for industrial and commercial organizations, and nine groups for special categories. The meeting will be adjourned for one day on the 3rd, and will continue on the 4th. Northeast Representatives Made Somber Reports Heilongjiang representative Lu Xunruo said in an infinitely somber tone: The security of the Northeast is the basis for talking about the security of China and even the world, but the current situation in the Northeast is still extremely critical. Of the nine provinces and two cities, Songjiang, Hejiang, Nenjiang, Heilongjiang, Hinggan, Harbin, and Dalian have not yet been recovered, and the compatriots are still living in dire straits. We hope that our compatriots can extend their sympathy, so that those who cannot make a living can live in peace as soon as possible, and those who are displaced can return to their homeland as soon as possible. The Northeast has extremely rich resources, and there are unlimited prospects for development in agriculture, forestry, mining, and industry. We hope that the entire country will not abandon it. Liaoning representative Li Zaofang said: You don't know how precious the motherland is until you are occupied. In the fourteen years that the Northeast was occupied by the enemy, tens of thousands of compatriots sacrificed themselves to resist the enemy. I would like to shed tears for the people of the country and say: The enemy has now surrendered, but the situation in the Northeast is still not optimistic. The Northeast has unlimited resources. There are so many chimneys in Shenyang alone that they are as dense as forests. At present, due to various reasons, those that are destroyed are destroyed, and those that are rotten are rotten, which is very sad. This matter will not only be laughed at by the world, but also by the Japanese invaders. We hope that the people of the country will know the meaning of "China will exist only after the Northeast exists", and engage in the revival of the Northeast. Instead of committing suicide by buying foreign goods overseas, it is better to save ourselves by developing domestic goods, and the Northeast is the best base for revival. Dalian representative Han Gangyun appealed on behalf of 1.8 million compatriots in Lushun and Dalian, not to forget a good piece of land that had been occupied for 52 years. Compatriots in Taiwan Province; A Mixture of Joy and Sorrow Taiwan representative Huang Madian said: During the enemy's occupation, the Taiwanese compatriots had twelve revolutions, and many people threw their heads for freedom. The suffering they suffered is hard to describe. Now that we have regained our freedom, we are truly filled with a mixture of joy and sorrow. Taiwan is extremely important in terms of national defense, and its wealth of products is also amazing. We hope that the country will value Taiwan. Since the recovery, due to various reasons, production has decreased. Sugar has decreased from 1.42 million tons per year to 100,000 tons, and coal has decreased from 300,000 tons per month to 100,000 tons. There is still much work to be done. Overseas Chinese in the Philippines and Vietnam; Severely Oppressed Xue Fenshi, the leader of the Philippine overseas Chinese merchants who was once arrested by the Japanese, reported: The national sentiment of the Philippine people is increasing day by day after the Philippines was recovered, and incidents of anti-Chinese sentiment are also emerging endlessly. Although the overseas Chinese have assets, they have no way to engage in industry and commerce, and there are various difficulties in returning to the country to invest. We hope that the currency system can be stabilized as soon as possible, and the economic policy can also be established as soon as possible. The overseas Chinese in the Philippines are very happy to return to the country to invest. In addition, after the Japanese surrendered, they lost all their markets in Southeast Asia. This is the best opportunity for us to seize foreign markets. We hope that we can pay attention to this as soon as possible before the Japanese invaders make a comeback, otherwise we will regret it too late. Vietnamese representative Chen Zhaoqi said: There are 600,000 overseas Chinese in Vietnam, and they have a great influence in the Vietnamese business community. The rice mills they run are also the largest in Vietnam, but they suffered heavy losses during the war. After the war, they suffered heavy losses due to the conflicts between France and Vietnam. In three major events, more than 200 overseas Chinese were killed and more than 400 shops were destroyed. Now, the French are intensifying their anti-Chinese sentiment, and incidents of mistreatment of overseas Chinese are emerging endlessly. All shops are subject to control, and even donations to the country for disaster relief are not allowed. Recently, overseas Chinese planned to transport rice back to the country for disaster relief, but it has not yet been shipped, and they have raised 8 million Vietnamese dollars, but they have no way to remit it back. We hope that the government can directly demand that the French government quickly implement the new Sino-French treaty and abolish all controls. Xinjiang Hopes to Invest and Develop Representatives from remote provinces such as Suiyuan, Ningxia, and Xinjiang reported today, all hoping that the industrial and commercial circles at home and abroad can invest in and develop the border regions. Xinjiang representative Zhou Haidong reported: Xinjiang is located in a remote border region, and its economy and culture are extremely backward. Everything is stagnant in the medieval state. Industry and commerce are extremely immature. The main reason is inconvenient transportation and special politics. In twelve years, the president of the Chamber of Commerce has been replaced eight times, and commerce has been difficult to develop. Since Chairman Zhang took office, the people have had a chance to breathe. For example, suspending taxation for half a year has been of great benefit to merchants. At the same time, transportation between provinces and regions has become more and more convenient, and commerce has become more and more prosperous. We hope that we can adhere to Chairman's instruction that "the foundation of national construction lies in the Northwest", attach importance to Xinjiang, and hope that the industrial and commercial circles can invest and jointly develop it. In addition, representatives from Qingdao, Hong Kong, Chongqing, and Guangdong also gave wonderful reports. Tianjin Zhong Textile Mill Operated Spindles At Full Capacity; A Total of Over 320,000 Spindles [Central News Agency, Tianjin, 2nd] The Tianjin Branch of Zhong Textile Company has jurisdiction over seven mills, with a total of 323,832 spindles. During the Japanese occupation, more than 200,000 spindles were operated at full capacity. After Zhong Textile took over, only more than 30,000 spindles were operated at the beginning. After more than ten months of hard work, on the Chairman's birthday, all the spindles in the seven mills were completely operated at full capacity, which not only broke the record of the Japanese occupation era, but also was a miracle in the national industrial world. Economic Construction Association Holds Annual Meeting; Weng Wenhao Points Out Three Key Points for Current Economic Construction; Also Suggests Opening Zhoushan Port and Building the Beijing-Xiamen Railway [Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 2nd] The sixth annual meeting of the China Economic Construction Association opened at 9:00 AM on the 2nd at the Bank of China in Nanjing, with more than 80 members attending, including Weng Wenhao and Gu Zhenggang. Chairman Shen Junyi reported on the brief history of the establishment and the purpose of this annual meeting. Weng Wenhao gave a speech, pointing out three key points for current economic construction: (1) Strive to increase production and reduce inflation; (2) Recommend that the government reduce transportation costs, subsidize the coal industry, and reduce the consumption of foreign oil to reduce the cost of various goods; (3) The biggest crisis at present is the sharp decrease in exports. We should immediately increase the production of local products, and the government should buy them in large quantities and sell them abroad to fight for international status. Finally, he suggested that in order to improve domestic and foreign transportation, Zhoushan should be opened as a free port to connect with the Southeast, and the Beijing-Xiamen Railway should be built to communicate with the Southeast. After Gu Zhenggang gave a speech, he continued the business report and discussed the central issues. In the afternoon, he discussed specialized issues such as capital, trade, industry and mining, public utility systems, and Japanese compensation to China, all of which had good conclusions. The election will be held in the evening, and there will be a comprehensive discussion at the general meeting on the morning of the 3rd. After the meeting, the entire group will travel to Wuxi. Changlu Salt Exported to Japan; 600,000 Dan Have Been Transported; Another 300,000 Dan Will Be Transported to Korea [Our Newspaper, Tianjin, 2nd] Since the restoration of Changlu Salt Administration, 600,000 dan of edible salt have been exported to Japan, and another 300,000 dan will be transported to Korea recently. The salt fields under the jurisdiction of the administration currently have more than 400,000 mu, and are expected to produce 7.56 million dan in the 35th year. In addition to supplying food for the people, some chemical plant raw materials also depend on it entirely, making it the largest salt production area in the country. Editorial: The Re-Proposal of International Disarmament Since Stalin published a letter and a conversation with the president of the United Press, due to the mild wording, many people think that the publication of this conversation may promote the adjustment of US-Soviet relations. In his written answers, Stalin did not think that US-Soviet relations were becoming tense, and even stated that the Soviet Union still intended to lend money to the United States. However, on the other hand, at the United Nations General Assembly in New York, the representative of Belarus criticized the British and American troops stationed overseas at the meeting, and Molotov also made a speech at the meeting, criticizing the British and American measures. In Molotov's speech, in addition to raising the issue of disarmament, he also criticized the British policy in India, the Dutch policy in the Dutch East Indies, the United Nations' control of atomic energy, and the failure to establish the trusteeship system. This is tantamount to dropping a bomb on Western countries. If Stalin's written words can cause some adjustment in US-Soviet relations, the publication of Molotov's speech has launched a diplomatic struggle between the Soviet Union and Western countries such as Britain and the United States. The first answer to Molotov's speech was the speech by US representative Austin, who said: "Molotov's speech yesterday seemed to have distrust and misunderstanding of the motives of the United States and others. I do not believe that mutual accusations between allies can promote the realization of unity." He bluntly gave a frank answer to Molotov from the beginning; but in fact, he made a deeper counter-proposal to the Soviet Union's disarmament proposal. Molotov's first point in his four proposals was to ask the General Assembly to consider the issue of general disarmament, while the US representative's counter-proposal was one step further than the Soviet Union's proposal, advocating that in addition to general disarmament, there should also be effective guarantees and international investigation of armaments. Under this position, the US representative supported the Soviet Union's proposal, but added counter-proposals for arms investigation and other safeguards. All of this seems to us outsiders a bit like attacking your shield with your own spear. The proposal of the disarmament issue, if it is intended to create a kind of international moral force to reduce the armaments of other countries, then in view of the past history, it may not be a guarantee for peace. US representative Austin saw this point clearly and first gave the Soviet Union's Molotov a frank answer: "Our unilateral disarmament after the First World War was a mistake. We must not allow this mistake to be repeated today." This is US representative Austin's frank talk. In fact, according to Stalin's speech, the Soviet Union has stationed 60 divisions of troops in various European countries; and the number of people contained in the so-called division is estimated to be inconsistent. According to Churchill, it is generally estimated that the Soviet Union has more than 2 million armed forces in various European countries, and the details of the troops in the Soviet Union itself are still unknown. Then, if you want to reduce armaments, the Soviet Union itself should first have a factual expression. The tragedy and comedy about disarmament after the First World War is still fresh in my mind, just as US representative Austin said: "We must not allow this mistake to be repeated today." Therefore, in addition to supporting the proposal for disarmament, there must be investigation and guarantee measures. In Molotov's speech, he also mentioned the conspiracies of "imperialists" like Churchill who were making trouble and undermining peace; this echoed what Stalin mentioned in his written speech. Churchill is an person out of office, and any of his remarks cannot directly have a practical political impact; and the Soviet leader and his foreign minister have repeatedly criticized him, which can be said to be an overestimation of Churchill. No matter what his political views are, Churchill is still an experienced old politician. In this Second World War, he also had close contact with the Soviet Union, especially with Stalin. Therefore, the criticism of Churchill is tantamount to criticizing Britain and the United States. As for the issue of atomic energy control and the establishment of the trusteeship system, the distance between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union is still very far. At the United Nations meeting, there was another repetition of the style of the Foreign Ministers' Conference and the Paris Peace Conference. Can this distance be bridged? Or should we choose to continue this situation and make the distance farther and farther? For the sake of world peace, we must use all our strength to bridge this distance. However, the most important issue is still the change in psychology. If we do not change from psychology, all efforts will be in vain. Wallace advocated using "appeasement" to change the heart of the Soviet Union; but in view of the past painful history, how can we use appeasement to change the heart of a country again? It has been more than a year since Germany and Japan surrendered, but there are still no signs of peace in the international situation. Now there is only an armed truce. The United Nations organization is the hope for maintaining world peace. We hope that under the auspices of the United Nations, there can be genuine international coordination to achieve world peace. Good Lighting, Good Life! Light is loved by everyone; darkness is hated by everyone. Light is morality, darkness is sin. Light has hope; darkness is doomsday. The ancestors of electricity, Westinghouse and Edison, racked their brains, spent their energy, and tested and retested before turning night into light. We Chinese also enjoy the fruits of their labor. We should prostrate ourselves and admire them, and at the same time thank God for giving us this unearned blessing. However, we are too disappointing. After fifty years of "reform", "revolution", "westernization", "construction", etc., we are still living the lives of our ancestors when we step into the interior. At night, the streets are pitch black and you can't see your fingers. The room is dimly lit, and you feel sorry for yourself. It's simply not like the world of civilized people! Now things are getting worse and worse, and life is getting worse and worse. The originally bright cities have also degenerated into a dark world. The dignified capital is having trouble generating electricity, and there are power outages every other day. Shanghai, which was built for us, also has a power shortage panic. Not only are red and green neon lights being banned, but starting this month, ordinary citizens will also be forced to use electricity at a "30% discount." Who can guarantee that there will not be rotating power outages in the future? Seeing this little thing of lighting, our hearts ache, like a sesame seed cake that is scorched on both sides. A country is not afraid of foreign enemies, but afraid of foreign enemies and not trying to improve itself. Many modern countries have been built up from wars. Now we have been beaten by others. We have finally won, but we have not been able to build anything in the long year after the war, and even the lights are still dimming. It's really sigh! A power outage is an unavoidable and necessary measure during wartime. This is a morbid state. Could it be that this disease is going to be or is it contagious? It has already spread from the capital to the capital, and it will also spread to Shanghai. Who dares to guarantee that it will not spread chaotically like a plague in the future? I remember on the morning of May 19, 1780, the eastern part of the United States, New England, suddenly became pitch black. By the afternoon, the blackness was even deeper, like a starless night, like a large and heavy magic hand covering people's eyes, like an ocean of ink pressing on people's chests, causing great fear. This day is commonly known as "America's First Black Friday". Many people ran to the church to pray, confessing their sins and begging God for forgiveness. What sins do we ordinary people have to suffer long-term "Black Fridays"? The lack of electricity is due to the lack of coal, or there is a problem with the machines. China has coal, and foreign countries have machines. Why do we have to create an "artificial" shortage of coal? "Artificial" lack of machines? Who is causing internal strife? Who is preventing the transportation of coal and machines? Who is controlling the transportation and sale of coal and not allowing everyone to rush to buy and transport it? Who is creating sin and darkness? As fish swim in water, they know whether it is cold or warm. In the atomic age, some people are cursing the fact that the lights are not good, which leads to a bad life, in a country where it is as bright as day at night. Recently, two writers, G. Nelson and H. Wright, complained about unsatisfactory lighting. They said that people neglect lighting, that the fluorescent lights in the "Holland Tunnel" are not ideal, and that the electricity in the Gang Province is the dumbest thing in the world, because it will slow down reading, make your eyes tired, and the iris will initially adapt and open to the largest hole, and produce a lot of retinal fluid, which is so unhygienic. The Dodge factory is manufacturing B29 bombers, and the factory spends 2.7 million US dollars just on lighting equipment; if the reward for production is not enough to compensate for this consumption, how can the factory owner spend this huge sum of money? Nara and Liang advocate using three-way lamps, light bulbs with reflectors, and recommend silver and crystal lamps to concentrate the light. They advocate installing various lights in refrigerators, wardrobes, drawers, and even next to the mirrors in bathrooms. Most modern cars have lights installed on the mudguards to illuminate the ignition</p>
<h3>Government States Further Concessions, Agreeing to Immediate Reorganization of the National Government Committee; Mediators from All Sides to Convene Again Tomorrow for Discussion</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing dispatch on the 2nd] A new avenue for peace talks emerged again on the 2nd. Zhang Junmai arrived in Nanjing from Shanghai on the morning of the 2nd and paid a visit to the Chairman at 3 p.m., presenting a new proposal. It is said that the proposal is simple and easy to implement, but Zhang is unwilling to disclose the details. Government representatives visited the Chairman on the evening of the 1st and, after learning of the Chairman's policy on the current situation, Shao Lizi and Lei Zhen visited Mo Dehui to inform him of this opinion. In the morning of the 2nd, the Third Party convened again to listen to Mr. Mo's report and discuss everything. In the afternoon, Liang Shuming and Shen Junru visited Zhou Enlai to convey the government's views. It is understood that the government has made concessions on the reorganization of the National Government Committee, agreeing to immediately reorganize the National Government Committee, but due to the urgency of time, it intends to reorganize the Executive Yuan after the National Assembly convenes. However, the Communist side still insists that both should be reorganized at the same time, so there are still discrepancies in fact. According to a certain relevant source, the Party is currently in a position to consider the cessation of hostilities on the ground, so everything is still in a delicate balance. The Democratic League and others have decided to hold another meeting on the 4th to discuss everything.</p>
<p>[French News Agency, Nanjing, dispatch on the 2nd] Shao Lizi, Secretary-General of the National Political Council, told the press that the central government has agreed to reorganize the National Government Committee before the opening of the National Assembly, and the Executive Yuan will be reorganized after all parties participate in the National Assembly.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, dispatch on the 2nd] The government accepted the proposal of mediators from all sides on the 2nd, and intended to conduct direct negotiations with the Communist Party, but must base the discussion on the eight points proposed by Chairman Chiang. In view of the fact that this method will inevitably be rejected by the Communist Party, the leaders of the mediators from all sides suspended all meetings on the 3rd and will discuss this issue again at 3 p.m. on Monday.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing dispatch on the 2nd] U.S. Ambassador Stuart visited the Chairman at 9 a.m. on the 2nd, and after an hour-long meeting, went to the church to attend the wedding of an American, serving as the officiant.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, this city dispatch] A source from the Third Party told reporters: the informal consultations in the capital have not stopped, and all parties are still maintaining close contact. Recently, the Third Party has suggested convening a comprehensive group of the Political Consultative Conference or an informal comprehensive talk, which is also a way to solve the problem. In short, the Third Party is still willing to make its best efforts to make the consultation a success as soon as possible and to achieve peace as soon as possible. Judging from the general trend, if the current situation can take a sharp turn for the better, so that all practical problems can be preliminarily understood, then the future of the overall situation can be optimistic. According to reporters' investigations, the representatives of the Third Party returning to Shanghai, except for the representative of the Youth Party who needs to stay for a few days to attend the Second Plenary Session of the Tenth Congress of the Party, Hu and Zhang Junmai have already arrived in Beijing on the 1st.</p>

<h3>Contents of the New Sino-U.S. Treaty of Commerce Include Consular Rights, Commerce, and Navigation for Nationals; Most-Favored-Nation Treatment to Be Stipulated by Exchange of Notes</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing dispatch on the 2nd] The Sino-U.S. Treaty of Commerce has been finally reviewed. It was originally scheduled to be formally signed on the 2nd, but due to the rush in procedures, it has been changed to be signed within the next week. It is heard that the contents are very extensive and detailed, and all matters that should be included in a general treaty of commerce are clearly stipulated therein. The main parts include: A. The rights and freedoms enjoyed by nationals, (1) entry, (2) residence, (3) travel, (4) work, (5) taxation, (6) military service, (7) protection of person and property, (8) purchase and sale of movable and immovable property. B. Commerce, (1) tariffs, (2) surtaxes, (3) internal taxes, (4) business licenses, (5) trade quotas, (6) commercial organizations. C. Navigation, (1) nationality of ships, (2) tonnage tax and port tax, (3) utilization of port facilities, (4) transshipment of goods by ships. D. Consular establishment.</p>
<p>As for the most-favored-nation treatment clause, after consideration by both parties, it was decided not to include it in the formal articles, but to make mutual and conditional stipulations by means of exchange of notes. The Sino-U.S. Treaty of Commerce is my country's first most complete treaty of commerce. The spirit of the treaty is strict, following the principle of equality and mutual benefit in general international treaties. The technique of treaty-making takes into account both law and fact. General Sino-U.S. commercial cooperation is necessary for the prosperity and economic stability of the two countries, and some existing commercial relations must also be given a legal status. Therefore, China and the United States have carefully consulted for eight months and drafted this extremely perfect treaty, precisely defining the rights and obligations of transportation and trade between the two parties. The diplomatic authorities attach great importance to this matter, and a simple and solemn ceremony will be held at the time of signing.</p>

Wherever they attacked, they forcibly collected eight years' worth of grain taxes and extorted cash, ordering the conversion of counterfeit border currency at a rate of 3.5 yuan of legal tender for 1 yuan of counterfeit border currency. Many county magistrates and public education personnel were killed by the Communist army, and many people who had assisted the government were also assassinated by the Communist army at night. Mr. Sun continued: The order in each county has gradually been restored, and government orders are being gradually implemented.</p>

<h3>Zhang Jia'ao Passes Through Beiping to Go to Beijing; Gan Jiaxin Talks About the Principles of Reconstructing the Northeast; Political and Cultural Education Should Be Given More Importance Than the Economy</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, dispatch on the 2nd] Zhang Jia'ao flew to Beiping from Jinan yesterday and is scheduled to fly to Beijing on the 3rd to report on his duties. In addition, Zhongwei Gan Jiaxin went to the Northeast to inspect and recently came to Beiping. He spoke to reporters about his views on the reconstruction of the Northeast, saying: The Northeast has a deep foundation and economic recovery is easy to succeed. However, it should be in line with national policy. Currently, there seems to be a sign that people are competing for things that are profitable, and let things that are slightly difficult survive on their own. This is really a big problem. I believe that the principle of rebuilding the Northeast is that the construction of political and cultural education should be given more importance than economic recovery.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping dispatch on the 2nd] Zhang Jia'ao quietly arrived in Beiping yesterday and is scheduled to fly to Beijing on the 3rd to ask the central government for instructions on economic issues in the Northeast. He is expected to return to the north in about two weeks. Mr. Zhang paid a visit to Li Zongren on the morning of the 2nd and, accompanied by friends, casually toured the new urban area of the western suburbs for the first time in the afternoon. The Beiping reporter group visited several times, but was refused. However, he indirectly answered reporters that the statement that the Northeast will use legal tender to abolish the circulation of coupons is absolutely incorrect. He also said that the Soviet staff who withdrew from the China Changchun Railway were retired staff.</p>
<h3>Local Troops in Southern Hebei Have Contacted the National Army</h3>

<h3>Headquarters of the 11th War Zone Announce: National Army Recovers Xushui City; Troops Can Meet in Caohe North of Baoding</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping dispatch on the 2nd] The spokesman of the Headquarters of the 11th War Zone officially announced on the evening of the 2nd that the National Army moving south from the northern section of the Pinghan Railway entered Xushui at 10 a.m. on the 2nd (the previous statements that Xushui had been recovered and that troops had met in Xushui were incorrect). This is a major progress in the National Army's aid to the Battle of Baoding. It is understood that Xushui is only one stop away from Baoding by the Caohe River, which can be said to be very close. However, Xushui and Gucheng are said to be places on the northern section of the Pinghan Railway where the terrain is suitable for combat. The Communist army has built fortifications and stationed heavy troops here. Whether there will be a fierce battle is of great concern to people here. According to a certain military expert, the National Army there is well-equipped and has a chance of victory. The Communist army outside Baoding is still constantly increasing its reinforcements.</p>
<p>[Our Gaoyi County dispatch on the 2nd] The National Army began attacking Xushui at 7 a.m. on the 2nd and completely occupied Xushui at 11:30 a.m. During the city attack, airplanes were also deployed to cooperate in the battle. The Communist army suffered about two or three hundred casualties, and most of them retreated to the west of Xushui City, now entrenched in an area of more than ten li west of the city.

<h3>Drafting International Trade Charter, Our Representative Submits Memorandum; Trade Restrictions and Other Items Must Be Revised</h3>
<p>[French News Agency, Washington, dispatch on the 1st] The Preparatory Committee of the International Trade and Employment Conference is currently being held in London. According to the US State Department spokesman, the drafting work of the "International Trade Organization" general charter is progressing rapidly, beyond [illegible] expectations. The Preparatory Committee has now accepted the draft charter submitted by the United States as the basis for discussion and is expected to complete the drafting by the end of November, so that it can be submitted to the International Trade and Employment Conference for discussion.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, special dispatch on the 1st] The Chinese delegation has submitted a memorandum to the Preparatory Committee of the International Trade and Employment Conference, proposing to revise several articles related to trade restrictions and tariff adjustments proposed by the US representative in the World Trade Charter. The memorandum stated that the use of inappropriate quantitative restrictions as a means of adjusting trade should be avoided. The Chinese delegation believes that it cannot accept the suggestion that adjusting tariff rates alone is sufficient to help countries with backward industry and commerce. The memorandum explained the Chinese delegation's opinion, with the reason that: "Tariff protection has been considered too high before it has fully achieved the expected results. This act not only violates the purpose of the conference, but will also increase domestic prices and damage the national economy." If tariffs are too low, foreign non-essential goods and luxury goods will flood the domestic market, making it impossible for domestic industrialization to be realized. "Tariff rates that are too high or too low will lead to adverse results in the transitional period for countries with backward industry and commerce. It is not easy to find a suitable balance. The Chinese delegation deeply feels that countries with backward industry and commerce must adopt commodity quotas or tariff quotas to adjust their national treasuries." The memorandum explained that: Countries with long-term trade deficits, such as China, must restrict the import of luxury goods and non-essential goods, and allow the import of essential goods to preserve their exchange materials. In the transitional period, restricting the import of luxury goods and non-essential goods by registration is not only necessary but also reasonable. This selective restriction only affects the types of imported goods, but does not affect the total quantity of imports. Regarding the definition of "reasonable quantitative restrictions" that countries with backward industry and commerce can adopt during the "transitional period." The memorandum stated that the period cannot be stipulated in advance, and the date is not determined by the situation of currency reserves and payments. Currency reserves and payments are the main indicators of financial stability and industrial development. Therefore, the Chinese representative proposed that the transitional period should be extended to (1) 50% of workers are employed in modern industrial enterprises, which are either producers or distributors. (2) 50% of its national income comes from modern industrial, commercial, and financial enterprises. The Chinese delegation hopes that these articles can be added to the final World Trade Charter, so that countries with backward industry and commerce can accelerate their industrialization process and finally expand world trade.</p>

<h3>Latest Atomic Bomb, 20 Feet Long and Weighing 4 Tons, U.S. Currently Stockpiles 100</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 2nd]: The "Daily Express" reports that the latest type of atomic bomb is approximately 20 feet long and weighs approximately 4 tons.

<h3>Second Public Auction of Enemy and Puppet Real Estate, Trust Bureau States: Unwilling to Handle Problems Arising, Management Bureau States: Abiding by Directives to Enrich National Treasury, Tens of Thousands of Residents Fear Loss of Homes and Disputes</h3>
<p>Since the victory, the housing shortage in this city has been severe. The Central Trust Bureau, to assist the government in solving housing difficulties, had planned to build apartments for sale, with an estimated cost of 40 billion yuan. A consortium of national and commercial banks was established and a method for raising construction funds was proposed and submitted to the Joint Treasury for approval. This plan was just passed by the 325th meeting of the council on October 24th. Before its implementation, all the residents of enemy and puppet houses on Weihai Road, Wusong Road, Wuzhou Road, Zhaopu Road, Changzhi Road, Yuhang Road, Tanggu Road, and other places in this city became panicked by the Central Trust Bureau's public announcement of the second auction of the aforementioned enemy and puppet real estate. They were particularly concerned about the provision in item 11 of the bidding instructions, which stated that all auctioned houses must be vacated within 20 days of signing the preliminary agreement. Yesterday, all the residents jointly issued an appeal. In addition to the opinions of all tenants, which are detailed in the announcement, a responsible person from the real estate department of the Central Trust Bureau stated: "This is the second time our bureau has handled the auction of enemy and puppet real estate, purely entrusted by the Enemy and Puppet Property Management Bureau of the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Region. This auction totals 39 units. The purpose of handling this business is to provide service, and we really do not wish to handle the indirect problems that arise." The opinion of Shen Guanya, director of the secretariat of the Enemy Property Management Bureau, is that the auction of enemy property to enrich the national treasury is being implemented gradually according to government directives. According to the principles of handling enemy property, it has long been stipulated that all auctioned houses should first maintain the original tenants, based on the original lease contracts. It is by no means that the successful bidder can force the tenants to move out. Of course, if the original lease has already expired, that should be treated differently. Regarding issues such as the equipment and renovations in the original house, according to lease customs, when returning to the original owner, the house should be restored to its original condition. The above points, including legal and customary issues, can achieve a reasonable solution by mutual reference."</p>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] According to reporters' inquiries, if the 39 units of enemy and puppet real estate auctioned by the Central Trust Bureau this time are sold and the original tenants are forced to move out, more than ten thousand people will immediately become homeless. In addition to an urgent appeal, all the residents are also appealing to the City Council and other relevant authorities.</p>
<h3>Visiting the Flagship Taikang, Radar Installed on the Deck, Depth Charges Carried on the Stern, Britain Donates Eight Small Boats to be Delivered to China in Batches</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] The flagship Taikang, one of the eight warships donated to our country by the United States, recently arrived in Shanghai for repairs at the Gaochangmiao Jiangnan Shipyard. Yesterday, the Navy Fleet Command specially invited the city's press to visit. At 2:00 p.m., they gathered at the department on Huangpu Road and first held a tea party. Chief of Staff Wei Jimin, the returning naval officers who had been training in England, led by Wang Huien, Instructor Bai Shumin, who is about to go to England to receive warships, and the Taikang's captain, Gao Ju, reported on the Navy's recent situation. Then, they took a small motorboat to visit the Taikang.</p>
<p>The naval officers and soldiers who trained in England left Chongqing via Calcutta and Mumbai last November, totaling 28 officers and over 250 cadets. After arriving in February this year, they began studying and training for seven months. Currently, except for a portion who remain temporarily in England, 16 officers and 86 cadets have completed their studies and returned to China. Three more officers and a portion of the cadets will also be driving eight small boats donated by the British to Shanghai in the near future.</p>
<p>These small boats will arrive in China in three batches. The first batch of three is already en route, the second batch of three has now departed, and the third batch of two can also be expected to arrive before the end of the year. Each boat weighs 40 tons and has a speed of twelve nautical miles per hour. Their characteristic is that they have great wave resistance and can continue to sail for three or four days, making them suitable for patrolling or guarding harbors.</p>
<p>In addition to the eight small boats, Britain is also donating one cruiser and two submarines. The naval authorities have appointed Colonel Deng Zhaoxiang to lead 600 officers and soldiers to receive them, and they will depart within a week.</p>
<p>The flagship Taikang is an escort destroyer. In February of last year, our receiving personnel arrived in Miami for training, and formally took receipt on August 28th. At the beginning of January this year, it left the U.S. and went to a military port in Cuba for tactical training, and only started its journey back to China in April. The entire ship is 300 feet long and over 20 feet wide, with a displacement of 1,430 tons and 680 horsepower. There are two machine guns with a caliber of 3 inches, two with a caliber of 40 mm, and nine with a caliber of 20 mm. There is radar installed on the top of the ship, divided into air and surface types. The stern carries many depth charges, all controlled by electricity. The ship has now been repaired and will patrol the coast in the future.</p>
<p>Furthermore, according to Chief of Staff Wei, the Navy's Shanghai Resident Office will be closed down. In the past year, the office received over 350 warehouses, with a total value of over 80 billion yuan, mostly containing clothing, ammunition, food, vehicles, and other materials.</p>

<h3>New Methods for Collecting Water Deposit</h3>
<p>The new unified collection method for water deposits in this city, proposed by the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau, has been amended and approved by the 51st Municipal Administration Meeting of the Municipal Government, and will be announced by the respective water companies within days and implemented from November. The methods are as follows: (A) The amount of deposit required from old users is based on twice the average monthly water bill of the user in the previous twelve months. (B) For new water users, if several houses share one public water meter, the deposit is charged based on the number of houses, with each house (based on the street number) being charged 4,000 yuan. If it is a separate meter, the amount charged is based on the size of the new water pipe's diameter. For example, for a new water pipe with a diameter of 13 mm, the minimum deposit amount is 6,000 yuan for ordinary users and 12,000 yuan for commercial users. For 20 mm, it is 9,000 yuan for ordinary users and 16,000 yuan for commercial users. For 25 mm, it is 12,000 yuan for ordinary users and 24,000 yuan for commercial users. For 40 mm, it is 15,000 yuan for ordinary users and 32,000 yuan for commercial users. For 50 mm, it is 18,000 yuan for ordinary users and 40,000 yuan for commercial users. For 75 mm, it is 60,000 yuan for ordinary users and 80,000 yuan for commercial users. For 100 mm, it is 90,000 yuan for ordinary users and 160,000 yuan for commercial users. Furthermore, if the water price changes, the amount of deposit required from new and old users can be adjusted. Old users can adjust according to the new price and the regulations in section (A), while new users must first submit a request to the Public Utilities Bureau for approval before they can adjust.</p>

<h3>Anti-Chinese Riots in Korea, Overseas Chinese Lives Unprotected, Appeal to Government to Send Personnel to Protect Them, A Batch of Refugees from Japan and Korea Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>One hundred and fifty-four refugees from Japan and Korea returned to China on the U.S. transport ship O-043 the day before yesterday, of which 73 were overseas Chinese from Japan and 81 were overseas Chinese from Korea.

<h3>MGM Cinema No Longer to be Built, Public Works Bureau Approves Alternative Plan for Underground Parking Lot, All Vehicles Must Park at the Racecourse</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] After the news spread that the American company MGM Film Company was preparing to build a first-class cinema in Shanghai, people here were very concerned. However, the architectural drawings of the cinema have not yet been drafted, and it is said that all the equipment will be designed by the American headquarters. After the Municipal Public Works Bureau passed the proposal, it sent a letter to the person in charge of the company, outlining the principles that must be followed in building in this city. The company can accept all the conditions, but they find it very difficult to establish a parking lot. The open space at the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Meibage Road is not very large. According to the conditions of the Public Works Bureau, a certain amount of open space must be left in front of the cinema for future widening of the road. If a parking lot is also built, it is practically impossible. Therefore, it is proposed to build the parking lot underground, with entrance and exit tunnels on both sides of the cinema. However, the Public Works Bureau believes that the above facilities are extremely inconvenient, and the movement of vehicles will inevitably be slow and congested, thereby hindering traffic on the road. Therefore, it has sent a letter to the company asking them to abandon this plan. Regarding the parking lot issue, an alternative plan has been approved, namely that all vehicles entering and exiting the cinema are only allowed to park at the edge of the racecourse, and then the audience can walk to the cinema to watch the show. However, the cinema must send employees to maintain order at the parking area regularly to avoid any violations. It is heard that the authorities of MGM Film Company have expressed their willingness to comply with the proposal.</p>

<h3>A Woman Protests Injustice, Husband Detained Repeatedly at Overseas Chinese Reception Center</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] At about 3:00 p.m. yesterday, while Judge Shen of the Fourth Criminal Division of the District Court was holding court, a middle-aged woman suddenly appeared, holding an infant and wearing a petition on her head, shouting for justice. According to her petition, her name is Xu Liangzhen, 34 years old, from Anhui, and she lives at the Overseas Chinese Reception Center in Yangshupu. Her husband, Zhang Hanchao, was detained by Shen Zhenhuan, the director of the Overseas Chinese Reception Center, at the beginning of September and sent to the Caohejing Refugee and Orphanage Shelter. She filed a complaint with the District Court on September 19th. After Shen Zhenhuan received the news, he released Zhang Hanchao the next day (20th) and ordered him not to sue the court. However, because the previously filed complaint could not be withdrawn in time, Shen Zhenhuan found out about it and, on September 22nd, once again colluded with the police to detain Zhang Hanchao in the shelter and prohibited family visits, and so on. Judge Shen ruled that her petition procedure was not in compliance, so he ordered the bailiffs to take her out and told her that if she wanted to file a complaint, she could submit it to the dispatch office.</p>

<h3>Letter to the Editor</h3>
<p>To the Editor: I recently read a cessation notice published in the November 2nd issue of the Democratic Weekly, which stated, "In addition to the police bureau repeatedly issuing secret orders to ban this publication, it also instructed the Shanghai Newspaper Association to notify all newspaper vendors not to sell this publication." Our association is the only trade organization for newspapers in this city and was only formally established on October 17th. We have never received any instructions from the police bureau ordering our association to notify newspaper vendors not to sell the publication. The statement in the notice that "the Shanghai Newspaper Association" forbids newspaper vendors from selling the publication is something our association has never heard of, and thus "the Shanghai Newspaper Association" is unrelated to our association. Fearing that the confusion of names and inaccurate rumors may cause misunderstanding, we are writing to request that your newspaper publish this fact to show our seriousness. Sincerely, Shanghai Newspaper Commercial Association.</p>
<h3>The YWCA Launches Fundraising Drive - Opening Ceremony Held Yesterday - Target of 180 Million Yuan - First Prize Winner is the Mayor's Wife's Original Chinese Painting</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Shanghai Chinese Christian Women's Youth Association's 38th fundraising conference, led by General Captain Huang Zhuoqun, wife of Mayor Wu, will launch a fundraising campaign from the 11th to the 23rd of this month with a target of 180 million yuan. Yesterday afternoon at 3 o'clock, the association held a grand opening ceremony at Mayor Wu's private residence on Anfu Road. Mayor Wu's wife, Deputy General Captains Yan Huiqing's wife and Huang Zuoting's wife, Speaker Pan Gongzhan, Deputy Speaker Xu Jiqing, Mr. Kong Xiangxi, Deputy Director of the Education Bureau Li Ximou, and about 300 local dignitaries, both Chinese and foreign, attended. Ms. Shen Zhoucuiying served as chairwoman.</p>
<p>Promote and Accomplish Mission</p>
<p>Mayor Wu's wife delivered a speech: The YWCA is an organization that promotes light. During the enemy-puppet period, it was unable to carry out its work due to oppression by evil forces. Now that Shanghai has been recovered, it is necessary to eliminate the darkness of the enemy-puppets. The YWCA's responsibility is particularly great. I hope that all sectors of society will work together to help it accomplish its mission.</p>
<p>Needs Light, Increase Strength</p>
<p>Speaker Pan then delivered a speech, briefly stating: Today, after attending the meeting and reading your association's work report, I was struck by the words "a source of light." Shanghai does indeed need light, and only light can add strength. Women bear a large part of the responsibility in society, at least half. If the YWCA has sufficient funding, its future will be limitless. From now on, the YWCA will carry out a kind of work, and the effectiveness of the work will depend entirely on the results of everyone's participation in fundraising. Finally, I wish the fundraising success.</p>
<p>Women Have Great Responsibility</p>
<p>Mr. Kong Xiangxi stated: There are many jobs in society that men cannot do well. Women have great responsibility. For the sake of the country and society, we should support the YWCA's fundraising and not just express it verbally. Deputy Speaker Xu also believes that the work of the YWCA is indeed necessary and is confident that it will exceed expectations. Subsequently, Ms. Wang Xiuqing reported on the association's fundraising and affairs, and Ms. Gao Junzhe reported on fundraising organization matters. This fundraising is divided into 50 teams. In addition to the three general and deputy captains, there are also 12 fundraising committee members, including Mr. and Mrs. Wang Xinkang, and Mrs. Chen Xing. There are 36 advisors, including Kong Xiangxi, Pan Gongzhan, Xi Wang, Wang Renlin, Liu Hongsheng, and Xi Debing.</p>
<p>The number of members in each team varies, and the team leaders are all well-known ladies and women in Shanghai.</p>
<p>After the fundraising amount is announced, the first-place individual can receive a valuable Chinese painting personally painted by General Captain Wu, the Mayor's wife. Exquisite prizes will also be awarded to the top five individuals and groups.</p>

<h3>Rendell Case Concluded - Sentencing on the Morning of the 5th - Defendant Asks for Appeal to be Dismissed - Original Ruling of Non-Acceptance Upheld - Two American Military Officers Testify on the Date of the Reception - Another Battle of Wits Between Lawyers from Both Sides</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The district court has already ruled that American United Press reporter Rendell is not guilty in the defamation case filed by Shen Ke, a suspected Nazi spy. However, Shen Ke's side is still unwilling to accept this and has appealed to the High Court, which continued the hearing yesterday morning. First, Judge Wang Jian opened the court to continue investigating the evidence for about two hours, and then adjourned the court. After ten minutes, he reopened the collegiate court for trial, with Chief Judge Zhang Qinglan of the Criminal Court serving as the presiding judge, and Judges Wang Jian and Zhang Shijie as jurors. The lawyers on both sides argued fiercely. At 1:20 PM, the court announced the end of the debate and scheduled the sentencing for 9:00 AM on November 5th.</p>
<p>During yesterday's investigation of evidence, most of the time was spent proving the date on which the American military reporters' reception was held. Because the Zilin West News, which used the United Press draft, was published on April 16th, and the certificate provided by the American military to Rendell proving that the content of the draft was consistent with the report of the reporters' reception, mistakenly stated that the date of the reception was also April 16th, which caused a contradiction. Because the materials from the meeting on that day could not have been seen in the newspaper that morning. However, Major O'Connor and Captain Farrell, the prosecutors from the American military court who provided the certificate yesterday, personally appeared in court to testify that the reception was actually held on April 15th, and that Rendell and Cushing et al. released the news based on the report on that day. The date mentioned in the certificate was indeed a mistake due to a lack of detailed investigation. When O'Connor et al. took the witness stand, they saluted the court, which is rarely seen in Chinese courts.</p>
<h3>O'Connor Expresses Apology for Mistaking Meeting Date</h3>
<p>O'Connor said: I apologize to the court for the mistake in the meeting date due to being very busy. The reception was actually held at the American Club from 9:00 AM to 10:00 AM on the 15th. It was indeed said at the reception that Shen Ke was sent by the German government to Chongqing to investigate the activities of our secret personnel in the coastal areas and the routes of United Nations personnel sneaking into the interior. O'Connor emphasized that the points published in the Shen Ke case were indeed unknown to the outside world before the press conference, and only became clear to the world after the conference. In fact, the meeting was held after Shen Ke was arrested. At this time, lawyer Yao suddenly asked: Was Shen Ke's activity location in Shanghai or Chongqing? If Shen's activities were in Shanghai, and after China and Germany declared war, then Shanghai was already controlled by Germany at that time, and it could not constitute espionage. The court then reminded lawyer Yao: "This is within the scope of the American military court." Rendell's defense lawyer Chen Tingrui also said: "It is the responsibility of the American military court to prove Shen Ke's guilt or innocence. If lawyer Yao has any profound arguments, why not publish them in the military court?"</p>
<h3>Captain Farrell Provides Supplementary Evidence</h3>
<p>Captain Farrell then provided supplementary evidence, saying: He himself also attended the reporters' reception on that day. About a week or so before this day, he had notified the German on April 15th to report to 53 Fuzhou Road. They arrived around 9:00 AM that morning and were arrested by Major O'Connor. There were many news reporters and photographers on the scene at that time. Rendell and Cushing et al. asked about the details of the matter, and we went to the nearby American Club together and published the case in one question. I myself had long been ordered to investigate the activities of the Nazi intelligence agency Ohard Bureau. When I was under General Zhang Fakui's command in my early years, I had assisted in the investigation. After coming to Shanghai last November, I continued to investigate the case. All the investigation results, in addition to being sent to the American military headquarters, have also been sent to General Zhang Fakui's headquarters for filing. I had informed Mr. Lun Jiner of the facts of the case, and Mr. Lun later published it. And what I told him that day was actually more than just the materials published in the newspaper. Fa also said: The date on the certificate was wrong because the files were not checked in a hurry. Other than that, everything is true and reliable, and there is proof. The court then asked what kind of proof? He replied that it could prove that Shen Ke was a traitor from the beginning to the end before and during the war! At this time, lawyer Chen stood up and said? The date of the reporters' reception and the content discussed at the meeting have all been proven, and Rendell's report is even more proven to be true.

<h3>Sharp Words on Both Sides - Extremely Tense Atmosphere</h3>
<p>When these two American military officers were testifying, the lawyers on both sides stood on both sides, and the words of interrogation were very sharp, and the atmosphere was extremely tense. However, lawyer Yao seemed not to have expected the defendant's side to say that these two people would appear in court. During the interrogation, perhaps due to insufficient preparation, he eventually retreated in dismay. The court ordered the end of the investigation. At that time, Judge Wang left the seat, and after about ten minutes, he reopened the collegiate court for trial.</p>
<p>When lawyer Yao described the reasons for the appeal, he said: (1) Rendell's report was inconsistent with the facts. (2) Even if Shen Ke had activities, his activities were in his own country or the occupied territory of the Allies, which could not constitute espionage. Therefore, Rendell's report was obviously a malicious insult. (3) Shen Ke did nothing wrong to China. Yao said: "Rendell can only prove the source of his news. If he said that it was told to me by others, I can be irresponsible, which is legally unfounded!"</p>
<h3>Lawyer Yao Makes Strange Arguments - Reporters Shocked</h3>
<p>As soon as lawyer Yao said this, the reporters in the audience looked at each other in shock, thinking that people who interview social news in the future, if they are not also police chiefs or editors-in-chief, will be on trial every day like Lundir, and reporters who interview political or military news will be burdened at all times. And lawyer Yao then attacked the American military headquarters for not publishing the text of the case under investigation to the outside world first. Moreover, the criminal law stipulates that the text that can be reprinted includes the proceedings of the central and local meetings, the open trials of the court, and public meetings. Lawyer Rao claimed that he also knew about the importance of maintaining good relations with friendly nations, but for the sake of the law, he could not help but do what he knew was impossible. In the concluding remarks, he still requested that Rendell be punished as he deserved.</p>
<h3>The Responsibility of a News Reporter is to Collect Materials</h3>
<p>The court then asked Rendell if he could prove that what he had recorded was indeed true? Rendell replied that he could prove it. In addition to the American military court Major O'Connor and Captain Farrell who have testified today, there are also Ge and Mei, who are responsible for investigating the case. In the American military court records presented at the last hearing, it can also be proved that Shen Ke is one of the highest-paid members of the O'Hart Bureau. Regarding the letters of evidence submitted by Ambassador Chen Jie and Mr. Wu Shaoshu, Rendell said: Shen Ke is indeed a "double spy." The responsibility of a news reporter is to collect new materials, weigh them, and then publish them to the world. News reporters are not people who specialize in investigating cases. I have been a reporter for more than 20 years, and I only know how to obtain materials from legitimate sources and report them faithfully. I am being tried today, which is really incomprehensible. On the point that news reporters do not have to do their own investigation work, I hope that a clear explanation will be given in the judgment. I have never known Shen Ke, but the defendant's side is certainly not unable to present evidence of Shen Ke's crimes.</p>
<p>Lawyer Chen believed that the letters of evidence from Chen Jie and Wu Shaoshu that were favorable to Shen Ke had no value in the evidence unless they were proved by appearing in court to testify. Rendell also said angrily: Just now, lawyer Yao said that Shen Ke's activities in his Ming Dynasty occupied territory could not constitute a crime, so wouldn't Wang Jingwei's activities in the territory occupied by Japan also not constitute a crime?</p>
<h3>The Spokesperson is Responsible for Whether the News is True</h3>
<p>Lawyer Chen stood up to argue that there are obviously two facts in this case: (1) The source of Rendell's record is based on the press conference hosted by the American military. If there is no fabricated or fabricated record, the defendant is not responsible. (2) Whether the news itself is true should be the responsibility of the spokesperson of the press conference, and the defendant is not responsible. The appellant's agent talked endlessly, a great theory, but combined these two into one, and even called Shen Ke a friend of the Republic of China, which is completely irrelevant to this case. As for whether Rendell's record of the American military press conference is correct, United Press is not the only one who has this record on that day, but also the United News Agency. If it was forged afterwards, how could it be the same? The appellant's side said that this newsletter was fabricated out of thin air and deliberately insulted Shen Ke, but in fact, the soil has been turned over, and there is a basis for the April 15th reception, and there are two people who attended at the time, Major and French Captain, to explain that Lun's record is completely the same as the report of the true reception, and there is no increase or decrease. In addition to the oral report on that day, the American military intelligence office also had a written record that Shen Ke came to China under the orders of the German high military authorities, which is the same as Rendell's record. Therefore, Rendell's record has been proven to be accurate. If Shen Ke wants to express that he is not a spy, he can present it in the American military court. This case should be discussed on a case-by-case basis and on a matter-by-matter basis. Whether Shen Ke is a spy or not does not need to be mentioned again, but if the court wants to know the details of this matter, the defendant's side also has evidence and is not afraid. Shen Ke endangered the Chinese government, endangered the Chinese nation, and endangered the War of Resistance Against Japan. Now, only because others recorded this kind of activity, he filed a lawsuit in the court of the country he intended to destroy, which is extremely absurd.</p>
<h3>Several Points of the First Instance Judgment Reason Cannot Agree</h3>
<p>As for the reasons for the first-instance judgment, the defender also deeply feels that there are several things that cannot be agreed with: (1) The original judgment is based on Article 211 of the Criminal Procedure Law, which states that the victim of a crime can file a lawsuit. However, there is no explicit provision that an enemy alien can file a lawsuit. No matter what country or law, no law can include everything, so Article 1 of the Civil Code still emphasizes custom, and Article 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law also has this law or other laws. For example, ambassadors from various countries have extraterritorial jurisdiction, which is not within the scope of the Criminal Procedure Law. Recently, the court did not accept the case of the United Nations staff being accused, which is also an example. (2) So, is there a basis for the fact that enemy aliens cannot file a lawsuit? In the first instance, the plaintiff submitted Article 8 of the Hague Convention, whether it is an interpretation of the chapter, it is not known, and it is an established practice, not a mandatory provision. (3) From the perspective of international law, Germany has no responsible government. In other words, there is no government to abide by international law. Since the opposing party has no government, our court must insist on abiding by international law, and the defender cannot agree with it. (4) In the first instance, the plaintiff said that if enemy aliens cannot sue, then murder and robbery, as long as the victim is an enemy alien, will not be able to become a crime because they cannot sue, and the social order will be disrupted. This is indeed the original trial's wrong view, because the country has a prosecutor who can still sue. (5) Article 296 of the Criminal Procedure Law refers to public prosecution, and Article 360 should be cited for private prosecution. If a Qiao has behaviors that are detrimental to the host country and has not been allowed to reside by the host country government, he shall not file a private prosecution in accordance with the law. Therefore, today's request is for two points: (1) Reject the appeal; (2) Still ask for a ruling of non-acceptance.</p>
<p>Finally, Rendell still asked the court to conclude the case as soon as possible so that his work would not be affected. In addition to the two military judges of the American military court, Ge Lei and Mei Jun also appeared as witnesses for Rendell yesterday. The court believed that the case was clear, and Zhu Yu did not summon them.</p>
<h3>Routh Flies to Tokyo This Morning - Returns to the US After a Brief Stay</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Routh, the publisher of the American "Time," "Life," and "Fortune" magazines, came to Shanghai a few days ago and met with President Jiang in Nanjing.

<h3>Secret Radio Stations - Investigation Results - Most Have No Special Function - Only Profit-Making Commercial Institutions</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Recently, the public security authorities have used scientific instruments to crack down on many secretly established radio stations. After an investigation, most of them have no special function and are only private commercial radio stations for profit. Due to the congestion of telecommunications agencies in this city, it often takes a very long time for businessmen to send business telegrams, and even the goods have arrived before the telegram has arrived. Therefore, private radio stations have emerged. However, since this type of radio station has not been approved by the government, it is illegal and will still be banned.</p>

<h3>Reader Consultation - Legal Questions</h3>
<p>(1) Deposit Dispute</p>
<p>Wang Huizhen asked: My husband deposited 500 yuan in national currency into a certain firm in the first month of the 28th year and established a passbook stating that the annual interest rate was 1%. At that time, he gave the money to me as an engagement gift. It has been nearly eight years, and he has never paid a penny. Now I want to withdraw it. (1) Can I handle it according to the supplementary regulations for civil litigation after recovery? (2) How many times will it increase? (3) If the firm refuses to increase, what should I do?</p>
<p>[Lawyer Qin Liankui replied] (1) If you want to increase the payment, you can use the supplementary regulations for civil litigation after recovery as the basis. (2) There is no statutory standard for increasing the number of times. (3) If the debtor is unwilling to increase, there is no other way but to sue.</p>
<p>(2) Inheritance Tax Rate</p>
<p>Miao Yulin asked: I have several questions about inheritance tax. Please answer them. (1) My father passed away last winter and left four houses. In the 34th year, he made a will specifying that his son, daughter-in-law, grandson, and granddaughter each receive one house. The tax is a progressive system. According to the regulations, the tax is calculated. I would like to ask if the total price of the four houses is calculated, or the value of each person's share is calculated according to the rate. In the above situation, is there a difference between having a will and not having a will for taxation? (2) The descendants have their own property with a household name as proof. Can the bureau forcibly treat it as inheritance? (3) In addition to the funeral expenses listed in the deduction list (please also indicate the highest amount that can be filled in), can medical expenses be listed? (4) Has this tax been implemented in Shenxi, Suzhou, and other places? Also, what are the solutions to the bureau's illegal estimation and extortion?</p>
<p>[Lawyer Qin Liankui replied] (1) Inheritance tax is calculated and levied according to the total amount of inheritance. Inheritance is the same, and bequest is also the same. There is no distinction between having a will and not having a will. (2) The property owned by the descendants cannot be treated as inheritance. The necessary expenses for funerals are deducted, and the maximum limit is not more than 1 million yuan. As for the medical expenses used before death, they are not paid from the inheritance, so they are not included in the deduction. (4) The Inheritance Tax Law does not have the provision for regional implementation. Even if the collection has a priority, all regions must implement it. Regarding the tax assessment by the taxation agency, if you are not satisfied, you can ask the original agency to review it. If you are not satisfied with the review decision, you can apply to the Inheritance Tax Review Committee for review, but you should pay one-third of the tax within fifteen days of receiving the review decision from the taxation agency. Otherwise, the right to apply for review will be extinguished. If you are still not satisfied with the review decision, you can file a complaint according to the law. If the tax officials have extortion, it belongs to the scope of criminal law. Complaints and reports shall be handled in accordance with the Criminal Procedure Law.</p>

<p>Initial Hearing of Drug Trafficking Case Via Air Transport – All Defendants Offer Excuses and Deny Guilt</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The large-scale drug trafficking case via air transport that was cracked by the Shanghai Police Bureau in mid-September resulted in the transfer of all thirteen criminals by the Police Bureau to the District Prosecutor's Office on September 23rd. The Prosecutor initiated a public prosecution, and the District Court held its first hearing yesterday afternoon. The defendants Sun Zhicheng, Li Hongying, Zhang Gentian, Zhang Yiren, Li Dingguo, Zhang Li Bingkun (female), Zhang Mingyuan, Yan Dongfu, Ma Xiangwu, Li Xinquan, and Song Zixin were all mentioned. Only Zhu Qishan was not mentioned due to illness. Judge Shen Tianbao questioned each defendant one by one. According to Sun Zhicheng, he is from Taiwan, a businessman, and arrived in Shanghai at the end of March last year. Afterwards, he traded drugs in Tianjin, Hong Kong, and Shanghai, but denied purchasing morphine at Zhu Qishan's residence at No. 4 Kunshan Garden. He also claimed that the morphine found during the search was left in his care by a friend and did not belong to him. Zhang Yiren stated that he had just arrived in Shanghai from Tianjin before his arrest and that the two suitcases containing morphine were entrusted to him by a friend surnamed Yang, and he did not know what was inside. Zhang Mingyuan stated that he arrived in Shanghai by plane on September 11th and that the drugs were entrusted to him by his father-in-law. All the defendants denied knowledge of drug trafficking. Due to the complexity of the circumstances and the cunning of the defendants' statements, the interrogation was very difficult. The three defendants, Sun Zhicheng, Zhang Yiren, and Li Dingguo, also requested a medical examination, claiming that they were injured during interrogation at the police station. The court ordered a postponement for further hearing.</p>

<p>[Report from this newspaper] Amidst the current downturn in the stock market, Yichang Securities Company (not a broker on the stock exchange), located on the fifth floor of the Gauze Building on Middle Zhengzheng Road in this city, suddenly declared bankruptcy yesterday. It is said that the company regularly engaged in wash sales, drawing in 3 million shares of Wing On Textile Factory this time. However, it ultimately succumbed to bankruptcy due to the continuous decline in the stock market in recent days. It is reported that the total loss reached a staggering 820 million yuan. Among them, two banks from the Sichuan group were affected by as much as 600 million yuan, and customers lost 200 million yuan. Furthermore, two or three other securities companies have also been impacted, causing instability. The company's manager, Mr. Wang, has disappeared and taken away 500,000 shares of Wing On in physical form. It is said that the actual losses this time may not be as high as reported, and there may be misconduct involved. It is now reported that the creditors are actively pursuing their claims.</p>
<p>Wash Sales Exposed, Stock Market Morale Weak</p>
<p>The Huagu stock market yesterday revealed panic before the opening due to the bankruptcy of a certain wash sale company in the Gauze Building. At the opening, the "three small heats" [three hot stocks] had already shown a slight decline. Wing On Textile was initially quoted at 650 yuan, but selling was prevalent, so the opening did not materialize, and it was revised to 640 yuan as the opening price. Xinhua followed suit, also dropping to 275 yuan at the opening. After the opening, a surge of buying orders emerged at lower prices, causing a rally. However, this was very brief, and prices gradually returned to their previous levels after the initial rise. At the same time, rumors were rampant in the market, and brokers were extremely panicked, many selling to protect themselves. Supply was unusually abundant, and short sellers also took advantage to demonstrate their strength. Midway, all prices fell to new lows. After 10:30, the market turned around after the lows, but the overall trend remained panicked. Later, wash sale companies outside the market stopped making new transactions and focused on settlements, gradually covering their short positions. Numbers 198, 89, and others were covering, and the Guang group, such as number 232 and others, also entered, gradually driving prices up. Near noon, the market fluctuated wildly, with strong short covering on the trading floor. As the closing approached, all prices rebounded. Absorption was evident in the "three small heats," and there was a willingness to strive for higher prices. As a result, compared to the previous closing, the hot stock Wing On Textile fell by 4%, while Mayar and Xinhua fell by more than half a percent. Jingfu and Xinguang showed a slight decline, while Qin Hing reversed course and rose slightly. Among the cold stocks, Cement, New Asia, and Huafeng remained flat, while Liann was slightly higher. The rest showed a slight decline of up to half a percent. The off-market stocks were relatively stable.</p>
<p>The trading of foreign stocks was sluggish, initially flat but then weakening. Market conditions remained devoid of fresh stimuli. As a result, compared to the previous closing, Huidong, Gangye, and Asia Paper fell by more than half a percent, while the rest did not fall much.</p>
<h3>Gold and Currency Both Loosen</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the buying momentum for gold bars weakened slightly, and the Central Bank added pressure, causing a slight rebound followed by a decline. The morning opening was around 2.33 million yuan. After the opening, the market was relatively stable, with the high price not exceeding 2.335 million. Later, pressure gradually increased, and scattered sellers also closed their positions, leading to a downward trend. Prices gradually retreated to around 2.31 million. After 10:00, the Central Bank distributed 120 bars at a price of 2.31 million, which further dampened the market. Prices once fell to 2.302 million before stabilizing. At noon, the market hovered around 2.32 million. In the afternoon, it was heard that off-week trading had risen again to around 2.335 million. As a result, it closed down slightly by 8,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Decorative gold was priced at 46,000 yuan, silver dollars remained flat, and silver dollars decreased slightly. The black market interest rate was around 1.5 jiao.</p>
<p>Foreign currencies showed a loosening trend. In the black market for U.S. dollars, rumors of a ban on circulation resurfaced, causing sellers to retreat to 4,050 yuan, a continued decline from the previous day. The sales of Hong Kong currency were even more sluggish due to the rise of the Shanghai Telegraph. Yesterday, it dropped to around 890 yuan, a decrease of 20 yuan compared to the previous closing. The Hong Kong exchange rate was also brought down to around 880 yuan. The Indian exchange rate was around 1,070 yuan, and the British exchange rate was around 14,100 yuan. All were sellers with few buyers. The official exchange rate for U.S. dollars remained unchanged, and transactions remained quiet.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong Gold Prices Plummet</h3>
<p>Hong Kong, 1st (Telegraph) - Recently, the price of gold here has fallen to 293 yuan. After inquiring with relevant parties about the reason for the decline, it was said that the banks here had previously obtained approval from the Hong Kong authorities to order the first batch of 100,000 ounces of gold from Mexico, which had arrived in Hong Kong one after another as scheduled. With supply exceeding demand, market prices have fallen. Not long ago, the banks again requested the Hong Kong authorities to purchase another 70,000 ounces of gold from Mexico, which will also arrive in Hong Kong. According to general speculation, gold prices may continue to fall.</p>
<h3>Government Bonds Plunge</h3>
<p>Yesterday, due to the dismal atmosphere among securities firms, a major player in the Gauze Building engaged in selling. Tongbing opened at 710 yuan and immediately faced selling pressure. Midway, it plummeted to around 1,370 yuan. Fuyuan made purchases at lower prices. As the closing approached, it hovered around 1,550 yuan. As a result, it closed down 180 yuan compared to the previous closing. Jia and Yi fell 120 yuan, Ding fell 50 yuan, and Tongwu also fell 90 yuan.</p>
<h3>Woolen Fabrics Remain Firm</h3>
<p>Recently, woolen fabrics of various colors at public tea parties have been in strong demand. Because the market supply is limited and buyer appetite is not weak, supply cannot meet demand. Most sellers are holding firm on prices. All retail and wholesale transactions are in cash. Even if checks are accepted due to special circumstances, the maximum period is only ten days.</p>
<h3>Improvement in Yarn Allocation – Two Pieces per Order Changed – Fine Yarn Also Increased</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] It is learned that the Cotton Yarn Allocation Committee has recently approved the request of the Replicated Products United Allocation Association to change the allocation of cotton yarn below 20 counts to two pieces per order. In addition, the variety of allocated yarn has been increased, including 40 counts TK yarn, 60 counts double strand, and 80 counts double strand, six strand, and other types.</p>
<h3>Cloth Prices Fall Below Cost – Lightweight Double Horse at 1.88 Million</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Yesterday, the yarn market started weak and ended strong. In the early morning, because various factories allocated a considerable amount of 20-count yarn, many people in the industry were selling their existing inventory. As a result, Extra Double Horse once fell to 2.06 million, and lightweight even quoted 1.88 million and 1.89 million. The market was filled with cries of selling. Only the Hankou group made small purchases on the dips, because the Hankou market price was slightly higher than Shanghai, leaving room for profit. In addition, the Beijing and Guangdong groups also bought on the dips, and the price rebounded. At the closing, the gains and losses of 20-count yarn were mixed, but generally remained firm. However, 42-count machine yarn fell by about 30,000 to 50,000 due to slower sales.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the cloth market also continued to decline, mainly due to the tightening of credit, making purchasing power even weaker. The opening price of Leading Spinning Construction was only 80,000 yuan, a decrease of 3,000 yuan compared to the previous price. Other mid-range products such as Wufu opened at only 76,000 yuan, and the number of applicants was virtually zero, demonstrating the bleak market situation. According to the allocation price of yarn, cloth prices have fallen below cost, and a severe period for manufacturers is approaching. If the prices of production materials are not reduced, the future of the replication industry will be difficult to be optimistic about.</p>
<h3>Vegetable Oil Rises Again – Mixed Strength and Weakness</h3>
<p>Yesterday, more than 12,000 stones of goods were registered in the north and south rice markets, but digestion remained sluggish. Northern Japonica rice was scarce and relatively stable. Indica rice had high prices at the place of origin, and owners held firm, so prices were also firm. However, Baiyuan shipments were sluggish in the morning, continuing to fall by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Yinyuan Zhongguan also fell slightly by 1,000 yuan. Southern Japonica early rice and Bo rice were abundant and sales were slow, plunging by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. Soybeans were imported from Shantou and Quanzhou, but Shantou factories in the city had weakened appetite, rebounding by 300 to 500 yuan, unevenly up to 1,000 yuan. Wheat demand exceeded supply, and goods were scarce everywhere, showing a continued rise of 300 to 500 yuan. Wheat bran stepped up by 100 to 200 yuan. Red sorghum had lively sales to distilleries, rising by 600 to 700 yuan. Sesame was firm and stable, red beans rose by 1,000 yuan, raw peanuts were high but secondary grades were stagnant, peanuts were neither good nor bad, broad beans had few arrivals and the market rose by 1,000 yuan. The oil market fluctuated suddenly, and raw vegetable oil rose again by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan, soybean vegetable oil was firm, rapeseed vegetable oil was stable, sesame oil was flat and steady, soybean cakes Shantou had a weakening but not strong appetite, weakening slightly by 100 yuan.</p>
<h3>Wheat Gradually Arriving – Feng Factory Resumes Production</h3>
<p>The problem of raw materials for flour in this city is said to be gradually improving. The date for the arrival of American wheat in Shanghai is not far off, and wheat is also being transported from neighboring counties. Fufeng Flour Factory resumed production the day before yesterday. The allocation of flour is still managed by the Flour Industry Association. Tomorrow, perhaps 12,000 bags can be allocated, with the allocation targets being the flatbread, fried dough sticks, and sliced noodles industries.</p>
<h3>New Translation of the Name "Rayon" – Rong Jin</h3>
<p>This newspaper - Tianyuan Baoye Company, the exclusive agent of American Viseose Cor P, has always managed the (Rayon). Due to the fact that the Chinese name "man-made silk" was not satisfactory, a new translation was sought in the newspaper at the beginning of September this year. More than 4,000 letters were received. After careful preliminary selection by the company, 17 names were selected, and industry giants and academic authorities such as Shu Zhang, Wu Baofeng, Li Shengbo, Cao Huiqun, Cheng Cangbo, Jing Zhong, Mai Weiyu, and Zhao Junhao were invited to discuss and decide on the 19th of October at the Hongjiao Club. It was decided to follow the principle of translating the sound of two characters. Therefore, the two characters "嫘緊" (léi jǐn) were adopted as the appropriate Chinese translation of Rayon. It is said that it is planned to provide the National Compilation and Translation Bureau for reference.</p>
<h3>National Banknote Industry Plans to Establish a Federation</h3>
<p>Banks and money houses across the country have very close business dealings, but in the past there has been no vertical organization. Recently, the Hankou City Bank Industry Association suggested to the Shanghai City Bank Industry Association that a National Banknote Industry Federation be organized. The Association has expressed its agreement and has sent letters to the Bank Industry Associations of major cities to jointly initiate it. Responses have been received from the Bank Industry Associations in various places expressing approval, so they will proceed actively.</p>
<h3>After American Cotton Rebounds, Government Does Not Intend to Take Action – Controls on Fabric Prices Will Be Lifted</h3>
<p>[United Press International, New Orleans, 1st] Cotton futures closed today up eight dollars and sixty-five cents to ten dollars per bale, and spot prices rose nine dollars and seventy-five cents.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 1st] The rise in cotton prices on Thursday and today has eased the pressure on the government to take immediate action to maintain the cotton market. The Economic Equalization Bureau is now considering lifting controls on cotton fabric prices, government purchase plans, and other measures, but no decisions have been announced to date. According to people in the cotton industry, unless the cotton market experiences another price drop, they believe that government plans regarding cotton fabrics will be announced only after the November 5th election.</p>
<p>Export Bonuses May Be Canceled</p>
<p>[Reuters, Boston, 1st] The Cotton Committee of the National Association of Cotton Manufacturers of America reported last week that the U.S. raw cotton export bonus system is a temporary measure designed to help U.S. farmers maintain foreign markets and clear the current large stocks of cotton in the United States. Since its implementation, this measure appears to have achieved its purpose. In view of the fact that there is no longer an excess of cotton stocks in the United States, the Committee recommends that the U.S. Department of Agriculture consider canceling the export bonus. The report continued: "Most U.S. mills rely on Asian cotton to manufacture special products. According to recent reports, there is little hope of importing Chinese cotton for at least a year. It is doubtful whether special planting of large quantities of cotton in the Hankou and Tianjin areas will be sufficient to meet export needs. At the same time, whether it is possible to obtain a sufficient amount of cotton from India is also in question."</p>
<h3>Large Consignment of Indian Cotton Imported</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] A large amount of Indian cotton arrived in Shanghai today, transported by the British Company's Enge Locke from Mumbai, totaling 31,163 pieces. It is scheduled to berth at the Gonghexin Wharf for unloading.</p>
<p>In addition, the China Merchants Bureau's Yansun Wheel sailed to Guangzhou with 26,000 bags of flour to Xiamen. The flour was originally banned from export, but the flour in question was allocated goods. Peanuts were shipped to Guangdong with more than 1,180 bags, medicine and sundries with more than 5,000 pieces.</p>
<h3>Eighth and Ninth Batches of Raw Silk Paid at New Prices – Total Receipt Exceeded 4,300</h3>
<p>The Foreign Trade Committee decided on the prices for China Trust Bureau's purchase of raw silk based on the grades inspected by various experts and the Commodity Inspection Bureau. The highest AA grade was set at 5 million yuan per stone, and the lowest grade was 3.4 million yuan. It is learned that the China Trust Bureau paid for the eighth and ninth batches of raw silk on the 1st according to the new prices, and all manufacturers have received the full amount. The price to be supplemented for the raw silk purchased in the first to seventh batches is being counted by the Bureau, and will be supplemented in full next week. Although the silk industry has objections to the prices of various grades set this time, no formal expression has been made so far, and the China Trust Bureau has not received any documents from the Silk Industry Association. Therefore, the Bureau is still paying according to the prices set by the Foreign Trade Committee.</p>
<p>In addition, since the Bureau has been purchasing raw silk, it has reached nine batches. The eighth and ninth batches were handled on the 30th of last month, with 140 dan in the eighth batch and 500 dan in the ninth batch, totaling 640 dan. However, according to the Foreign Trade Committee's method, unqualified goods will not be purchased. The Bureau rejected 15 dan in the eighth batch and 30 dan in the ninth batch, rejecting a total of 45 dan, purchasing only 595 dan. Adding the previous seven batches of 3,710 dan, the total purchase reached 4,305 dan.</p>

Their strength has become even more complete. Youyou will once again rely on veterans Zhang Rongcai and Feng Yunyou to guard the three positions. The attack of forwards Lei, Yuan, and Tian is not weak, but they must be cautious in the face of a strong enemy.</p>

<p>(1) October 26, won against the White Team (Air Force 74th Army) 69-34 (Nanjing), (2) October 26, won against Songqing (Zhongda) 37-21 (Nanjing), (3) October 27, won against Jinghua (Combined Team) 41-33 (Nanjing), (4) October 28, won against the Eagle Team (US Army) 53-30 (Nanjing), (5) October 31, won against Liangxi 50-38 (Wuxi).</p>
<p>After the competition in Wuxi, the team did some sightseeing. They returned to Shanghai by train the day before yesterday (1st), waiting for the Philippine Black and White team to arrive in Shanghai. However, the Black and White team was late in arriving, so the team took the opportunity to visit Hangzhou today. The group of more than ten people was led by Lieutenant Colonel Wu Zhuoming. They will play for a day or two and then return to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Luoyang Thanks</p>
<p>In addition, yesterday, Qian Xucang, Chairman of the Basketball Association, received a telegram from the head of the 6th Transport Regiment, thanking all sectors for their guidance to the Zheng Lun team during their stay in Shanghai. The original telegram is recorded below: "From Wu Zhuoming, instructor of the 6th Transport Regiment, and Liu Mi, translated and sent to Mr. Qian Xucang, a distinguished figure. Our regiment's Zheng Lun basketball team came to Shanghai for sightseeing and was fortunate to receive your care, enabling us to learn from the Shanghai team and the Allied forces. Our regiment is insignificant, and the Zheng Lun team's basketball skills are clumsy and not worthy of high praise. However, we dare not lag behind others in promoting military sports to strengthen our military spirit. Victory or defeat is not the point. We have gained a lot this time and are grateful for the tireless guidance from all sectors. Thank you by telegram. Cao Yigeng, Commander of the 6th Transport Regiment of Luoyang"</p>

<h3>Compiling and Reporting Household Statistics - The Ministry of Interior Sets a Uniform Method -</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Interior believes that the Detailed Rules for the Implementation of the Household Registration Law have been revised and promulgated by the Executive Yuan and are now in effect. The compilation and reporting of household statistics should be handled in accordance with the provisions of the revised Detailed Rules to ensure uniformity. However, in the past, the types of household statistical forms differed from province to province due to different environments, and the reporting periods were also inconsistent. In order to gradually improve and seek uniformity, it is hereby decided that, starting from October this year, the compilation and reporting of various household statistics should be handled in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 5 and the attached tables of the aforementioned Detailed Rules.</p>
<p>After October this year, provinces and cities that have completed household surveys or household inspections should compile two copies of the population statistical report forms (1) to (6) attached to the Detailed Rules and forward them to the Ministry. Those who have handled household registration should compile two copies of the monthly household registration statistical report each month and forward them to the Ministry. At the end of the year, the aforementioned population statistical report forms (1) to (6) should still be compiled in two copies and forwarded to the Ministry to ensure uniformity and facilitate application. It is heard that a telegram has been sent to the Municipal Government for investigation and handling.</p>
<h3>26 Districts Meet to Dedicate Schools</h3>

<h3>Jiangxi Actively Develops Coal Mines - Anyuan and Tianhe Two Major Coal Mining Areas Are Transferred to State-Owned Enterprises - New-Style Coal Mining Plants Will Be Established and a Coal Mining Bureau Will Be Established</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Yu Ningpo</p>
<p>Jingdezhen, 7th</p>
<p>Coal is a necessity of life and an essential element of motive power. The prosperity or decline of the coal industry is directly related to the national economy and the people's livelihood. The Yangtze River area has relatively developed industry and commerce, with an annual demand for coking coal of more than 4 million tons. However, there are no large-scale coal mines near the Yangtze River to meet the demand. In the past, the coal used in the Yangtze River area, except for the Kailuan coal mine, which sold hundreds of thousands of tons annually, was mostly Japanese coal and Fushun coal. The Chinese coal market was almost entirely controlled by them. The daily coal consumption of the provinces along the river could not even be self-sufficient. Isn't this a strange historical fact in the world?</p>
<p>Provincial Coal Production</p>
<p>To solve and supply the above coal demand, only Jiangxi coal production is the most advantageous and convenient. The amount of coal reserves in Jiangxi Province cannot be determined because there has not been a comprehensive survey and statistics of the reserves. According to the estimates of the Central Geological Survey Institute, the coal reserves in the province are approximately 989 trillion tons, ranking seventh among the coal-producing areas in the country. Detailed examination of the basis of the estimation is limited to Leping, Pingxiang, Ji'an, Fengcheng and other counties. Other counties such as Yichun, Wanzai, Wuning, Shangrao, Yushan, Xinyu, Gao'an, and various counties in southern Jiangxi, are generally not included. If the coal-producing areas in the above-mentioned counties are added to the statistics, the coal production should be at least 3,500 trillion tons.</p>
<p>Mines Decline</p>
<p>The largest coal mine in Jiangxi is the Pingxiang Coal Mine, which is also the largest coal mine in the country. The second largest is the Pole Coal Mine in Leping, and the third largest is the Tianhe Coal Mine in Ji'an. When the Hanyang Iron Works was first established, the daily output of Pingxiang alone exceeded 3,000 tons, totaling more than 6,000 tons annually. Later, due to the influence of the situation and the closure of the Hanyang Iron Works, the output was reduced by more than half. At this time, it could still be maintained. After 1930, it became even more depressed, and the business was hit by the best-selling foreign coal in various places, making it difficult to maintain. Similarly, the Leping Pole Company was disturbed by the Red Bandits several times, and the output could not be restored. The output of other small mines was even more difficult to maintain at a certain amount. In 1929, the province's coal sales dropped sharply to 663,850 tons, in 1930 to 456,340 tons, and after 1931 to 341,000 tons.</p>
<p>Provincial Government Seeks Control</p>
<p>Recently, the Jiangxi Provincial Government, recognizing that the coal production in the province is gradually increasing but the output is very small due to manual mining. In order to adjust the province's coal demand, a three-year mining plan has been formulated, expecting to supply it without interruption. In addition to transferring the Anyuan and Tianhe coal mines to state-owned enterprises, all private mines in Fengcheng, Yichun, Wanzai and other places will be controlled, and those who originally held mining licenses will be required to apply for registration within a time limit, otherwise their mining rights will be revoked. Regarding the Tianhe Coal Mine mining plan, a preparatory office has been jointly established by the Resources Committee and the Jiangxi Provincial Government to handle it specifically. The Coal Mining Bureau will be established within the year to carry out mechanized mining, with an estimated output of 800,000 tons in three years. The past and present conditions of the Anyuan and Tianhe coal mines are recorded separately below, so that the general situation of the large coal mining areas in Jiangxi can be seen.</p>
<p>Anyuan Mine Overview</p>
<p>Pingxiang Coal Mine is one of the largest mines in China. The mining area is in Anyuan, Pingxiang, with a width of ten miles. It is mined as a tributary of Tianci Mountain. Anyuan Mountain is 15 miles southeast of the county. Tianci Mountain is 690 feet high and has a slope of 29 degrees. Its veins come from Majiling in Lotus County. According to the German technician who discovered the mine, if one million tons are mined annually, it will continue for 500 years, so the richness of its coal reserves can be imagined!</p>
<p>The origin of the mine is that Zhang Zhidong, Governor of Huguang in the 22nd year of Guangxu in the former Qing Dynasty, founded the Hanyang Iron Administration Bureau. Because fuel was supplied from Kailuan, Ma'anshan, Tangshan, the United Kingdom, and Japan, the prices were expensive and the coal quality was poor. Therefore, it returned to self-mining coal mines for application. A German mining engineer was specially sent to investigate in Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, and Anhui. In the 24th year, a large coal field was found in Pingxiang. The color was as black as lacquer, the luster was very strong, it was rich in cohesiveness, and the volatile matter was small, which was suitable for coke refining for ironmaking. Zhang and Sheng Xuanhuai raised one million taels of gold to start mining. In the 28th year, it was further expanded and four million marks of German gold were borrowed from the German company Lihe, and German Lailun was hired as the chief technician and Zhang Shaozhen was appointed as the general manager. In the 34th year, Sheng merged Pingxiang Coal Mine, Hanyang Iron Works, and Daye Iron Mine into one, called Hanyeping Company. At that time, the Japanese envied the success of German investment and intended to take the opportunity to compete. Sheng decided to use Japanese debt to replace German debt after the company was formed. Later, the Japanese side even encouraged expansion. By the end of the abolished Qing Dynasty, the loan had reached a huge amount of 30 million yuan. During the Republic of China era, until the European War, the mine had a vigorous atmosphere. The daily output once reached 3,000 tons. At that time, the demand for iron was very broad, only because the government did not supervise it and the organizers indiscriminately borrowed Japanese debt, thus losing the interests and opportunities, and letting go of a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. At that time, someone calculated that the loss was actually more than the total property of the company. After the Communist Party hosted the Pingxiang Miners' Club in the 12th year of the Republic of China, labor unrest occurred frequently, and production declined sharply. At the same time, it was affected by military affairs and transportation inconvenience, making management more difficult. In the 14th year, the Hanman Iron Factory stopped work, and Pingmei was hit hard. From the autumn of that year, the coal produced was only for the mine's own use and sold locally. In the 15th year, the Revolutionary Army arose, and the mining was hosted by red workers. In the spring of the 17th year, local gentry and garrison commanders raised tens of thousands of funds to organize a company to purchase coal and sell it on their behalf to maintain the food supply for the mine workers. It was impossible to maintain due to limited resources and little capital. In the winter of that year, in order to take care of local security and maintain the lives of thousands of employees, the Jiangxi Provincial Government appointed He Zhaozeng as the Pingxiang Commissioner to advance funds for maintenance. After the start of work, the daily output of coal was 800 tons. In the autumn of the 18th year, the Jiangxi Provincial Government was reorganized and Xiao Jiaxin was appointed as the Pingxiang Commissioner. After serving for more than a year, he lost more than 300,000 yuan. In the spring of the 20th year, the Provincial Government was reorganized again and Dong Lun was appointed as the Pingxiang Commissioner. The local authorities also asked fellow villagers in Hunan to advance funds for repairs. In June of the 20th year, the water drainage machine at the bottom of the direct well malfunctioned. The repairs were not timely, causing the lower layer of the Eight-Fang well to be flooded. The daily output of coal was only more than 500 tons. In the 21st year, the Jiangxi Mining Affairs Special Committee drafted a plan to rescue the Pingxiang Coal Mine, and continued to appoint He Zhaozeng as the Pingxiang Commissioner and Liu Wenyi as the Deputy Commissioner to be responsible for handling it. After the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, the mining business fell into stagnation again. Recently, the Jiangxi Provincial Government has reorganized the control plan for the province's coal mining areas. The Anyuan mining area has a larger scope and is classified as state-owned. The revitalization of the mine is expected to be realized soon.</p>
<p>Tianhe Mine Overview</p>
<p>Tianhe is 120 miles away from Ji'an County and 600 miles away from Nanchang by water. The mining area is in Zhouyuan Village, 15 miles away from Tianhe. The coal seam there is from ten feet to eight or nine feet thick, with abundant reserves. People mined it in the Ming and Qing Dynasties. At the end of the Guangxu reign of the Qing Dynasty, Ye Biaoke from Xuanhua planned on a small scale and used manual excavation. After several months, he had not yet obtained the source of the mine. Although Ye suffered losses, he was not discouraged. He raised funds to continue mining. The following year, he made a huge profit. He applied for registration and requested the Ministry to issue a mining license, making considerable profits every year. However, wherever there is profit, people flock to it like ducks. Dozens of people have successively rented mountains and obtained licenses to excavate there. In the 15th year of the Republic of China, each mine produced about 300-400 dans of coal per day, and there were about 300-400 miners. The coal produced was sold to ships, railways, and Wuhu, and other ports. Because the coal quality was quite good, they were happy to buy and use it. During the Red Bandit's disturbance, the mine shafts were destroyed, almost completely bankrupt. After the peace, Zhang Jingjiang, a central supervisory committee member, stated to the central government that the original manager of the mine had stated that the Tianhe coal reserves were abundant. If funds could be raised for mining, it would not only maintain the lives of the majority of mine workers, but also continuously supply the country's production and construction. Therefore, Zhang invested 300,000 yuan to expand the original mine shafts and planned to build a light railway of 13 miles from the mine shafts to the wharf. In the 22nd year, Zhang sent Yu Zhimin to the mining area for an on-site survey. He believed that the bituminous coal was abundant and could be used to refine coking coal. After Yu reported back, he ordered Zhang to plan construction on the one hand, and continue to use the local method for mining on the other hand.</p>
<p>There were more than ten other coal bureaus in total. After the 15th year, only seven remained, namely Yichang, Yuanda, Fuchang, Jichang, Huikang, Changming, and Anji. The area of the mining bureau ranged from more than 500 mu for the large ones to more than 40 mu for the small ones. The seven totaled more than 1,500 mu, equivalent to more than 90 hectares. The most difficult thing in the mining area was the inconvenience of transportation. The 15 mu from the production area to Tianhe were all mountain roads, making it difficult to travel by car. All of them were carried by manpower. From the mining mountain to Tianhe, each person could only carry it twice a day. From Tianhe to Ji'an, the water journey was 180 li. During the spring and summer when the water level rose, folk boats with a load of 1,000 dan could pass unimpeded. In winter, when the water was shallow, they could only carry a load of 500 dan. The transportation workers were all local workers. It was not easy to hire, and it was even more difficult to increase or decrease the number of workers. At the busiest time, there were fewer workers, and at the most idle time, there were more workers. The coal transportation system was adopted by each mining bureau, and the number of days of rotation for each month was stipulated and could not be changed. The Provincial Government believed that the production of the mining area was abundant and that large-scale mining should be carried out. Dividing it into many small mines hindered the development of the mining industry, and construction was prone to obstacles and various disputes were prone to occur. It was once planned to merge the mines for mining, but it failed due to difficult work and huge costs.</p>
<p>Recently, according to the authorities' estimates, the reserves of the mine are 17 million tons. The Resources Committee and the Jiangxi Provincial Government are jointly investing in manual mining for the time being, and are planning to establish a new-style coal mining plant. It is expected to be completed in three years. In terms of business, bituminous coal will be mined, and part of it will be transported to Ji'an for use as fuel for ships and power plants in the Gan River basin, and part of it will be used for coke refining. In terms of equipment, two 750-kilowatt steam turbine generator sets will be specially installed to switch to electric mining. In the first year, the estimated coal production is 72,000 tons, 180,000 tons in the second year, and 540,000 tons in the third year. The total equipment cost is US$2 million. Once the Resources Committee's approval is obtained, the new plant can be established.</p>
<h3>From Shaobo to Baoying</h3>
<p>— Hesheng</p>
<p>Gaoyou Dispatch, 25th</p>
<p>Shaobo—it is a town belonging to Jiangdu County. It looks like just a small dot on the map, with nothing special about it. However, for the refugees from northern Jiangsu who have been fleeing to Yangzhou, Zhenjiang, and the areas of Nanjing and Shanghai over the past year, it is of particular concern. Especially for the people of Yangzhou and Taizhou, it can be said that they are worried day and night because they feel the threat is too great. It is only forty li away from Yangzhou city, a morning's journey, and they see with their own eyes the suffering of the fleeing refugees, and hear with their own ears the misery of the so-called "liberated areas." If Yangzhou falls, what will be their fate? So they are constantly watching it with trepidation.</p>
<p>At the same time, Shaobo is the throat of the Grand Canal and the gateway to Central China. Its importance is like Gibraltar in the Mediterranean and the Bosphorus in the Black Sea. "If Shaobo is held firmly, Central China will be secured," this is the slogan written and shouted by the Communist army in Shaobo. Indeed! Relying on the complexity of the terrain and the strength of the fortifications, even though Huaibei, the heart of Central China, has been recovered by the National Army, they are still determined to defend Shaobo to the death. When the National Army began its counterattack on the 5th of this month, they dispatched reinforcements from Xinghua and Gaoyou in different directions, hoping to secure this gateway to Central China. Little did they know that they would eventually be no match for the power of the National Army's artillery fire and the bravery of the officers and soldiers. In the battle on the south bank of Shajiang Dam, all nine strong fortresses were destroyed, and all but forty-eight of the more than three hundred officers and soldiers were captured, the rest all went to "E'du City" (died).</p>
<p>Building Pontoon Bridges Overnight, Forcing Crossings at Three Locations</p>
<p>After occupying the south bank of Shajiang Dam, it would have been possible to press on victoriously, but they were blocked by the Shajiang River, which was more than sixty meters wide, and could not fly across. Therefore, raft-style pontoon bridges were built overnight, and forced crossings were carried out at three locations under the cover of artillery fire. Some officers and soldiers who were good at swimming disregarded the cold and were willing to sacrifice themselves. *plunk! plunk!* They jumped into the water like a flock of ducks and quickly swam to the other shore to seize the fortifications. That night, the National Army captured the positions on the north bank of the Shajiang River and the Dongyue Temple stronghold. At the same time, our left-wing troops, after a day and a night of bloody battle, broke through eight strong enemy fortifications and reached the south street of Shaobo. The bandits reinforced and counterattacked several times, but ultimately could not reverse their tragic fate. The 10th Column, known as the "victorious army," scattered in three directions—Yangzhuang, Zhenwu Temple, Zhaoguan Dam—with its 85th, 87th, and 89th Regiments fleeing in disarray. On the morning of the 6th, we completely occupied Shaobo and immediately gave chase in different directions. As a result, the famous Zhaoguan Dam, a natural barrier that was easy to defend but difficult to attack, was captured in just three hours of battle. There is a saying among the people of northern Jiangsu, "To capture Zhaoguan, ten thousand must die," but we only suffered a few dozen casualties and took Zhaoguan. By 6:00 p.m., our army had pursued beyond Lujin Town.</p>
<p>The author arrived in Shaobo at 8:30 a.m. on the 6th. Commissioner Lin from the Fifth District, County Magistrate Zhang from Jiangdu, and reporters from various newspapers stationed in Yangzhou arrived one after another. We posted notices to reassure the people, and at the same time inspected the battlefield to observe the traces of war. We walked a lot of roads, but everyone did not feel tired. At the same time, we also decided to convene a mass meeting at 2:00 p.m.</p>
<p>Truly, beyond our expectations, in less than an hour, the townspeople, supporting the old and leading the young, men and women, gathered at the square where they had often participated in "struggles" and "liquidations" in the past. Although only about eight hundred people attended the meeting, everyone who remained in the town, except for those watching the doors, went. The excitement expressed on each person's face was truly indescribable.</p>
<p>The meeting began without any ceremony. First, County Magistrate Zhang introduced me to speak first. I was not prepared to say anything. I simply explained why we still had to fight after the victory of the War of Resistance, why everyone still could not live in peace and prosperity, and the government's repeated tolerance and concession to the Communist Party. Then I asked them why everyone looked so gaunt and poorly clothed today. Hadn't the Communist Party liberated you? They exclaimed in unison with emotion: "Liberated! If you hadn't come, if we had been liberated by them for another two months, we wouldn't be alive!" Finally, I told them about a few things they should pay attention to and abide by in the future, and they expressed their sincere acceptance.</p>
<p>After I finished speaking, Deputy Brigade Commander Li, Commissioner Lin, County Magistrate Zhang, and others continued to speak. Although more than two hours had passed, the order remained the same. Their excitement and joy overflowed from their eyebrows, and they applauded in unison at the moving parts, applauding no less than twenty times. I have never seen such a good situation at a mass meeting. After the meeting, I said to County Magistrate Zhang: How does it compare to the mass meeting in Yangzhou? They have been trained! County Magistrate Zhang did not answer, but smiled.</p>
<p>On the way back, I thought to myself that people generally think that the Communist Party's propaganda and training of the people is so remarkable. Today, it seems that the effect of their propaganda and training is like this, which may be beyond their expectations! A message to the CCP! Deceptive propaganda is useless. If you want to succeed, you must change your style! Otherwise, if you continue to fight, there is still no hope!</p>
<p>At dawn on the 7th, the National Army continued to advance. We expected that there would be another fierce battle in Cheluduo, Wuliba, and other places. These two places are the gateway to Gaoyou, and the terrain is very complex, and the fortifications are very strong. According to intelligence, there is still a regiment of troops holding Cheluduo, and the 82nd and 84th Regiments are preparing to defend Gaoyou to the death. However, our officers and soldiers still felt that their numbers were too small and that the fighting was not enjoyable. They ran away as soon as they were hit. Wouldn't running away mean waiting for the next fight? This is really a nuisance. Not only is the political negotiation of the Communist Party repeatedly a nuisance, but the fighting is also the same. I hope for a total liquidation, a happy and thorough annihilation battle, but they fight and run, run and fight, the same tune as fighting and talking. From this, it can be seen that their party, government, and military personnel are all birds of a feather.</p>
<p>National Army Enters Gaoyou, Pursuing Victoriously in Different Directions</p>
<p>Sure enough, the vanguard advanced to Cheluduo. Although they resisted stubbornly with their fortifications, the enemy's courage had been chilled and they could not hold on. In less than two hours of battle, we occupied it, capturing dozens of people and seizing dozens of guns, as well as three brand new and complete mortars. In addition, many were killed by us. That night, we advanced to Wuliba, and Gaoyou city was in sight. The officers and soldiers were all brave, and they planned to stay in the city tonight, but the Communist army set fire to the bridges in Wuliba. After extinguishing the fire and repairing the bridges, it was already 8:00 a.m. on the 8th. The National Army entered Gaoyou city at this time and pursued in different directions to the east and north.</p>
<p>When I entered Gaoyou city, the first thing that surprised me was that the people of Gaoyou city were setting up incense tables along the road to welcome the National Army. Many old women were chanting "Amitabha, the Old Central Government has really returned," and the sound of firecrackers was deafening. Some children followed the队伍running and asked our soldiers, "Why didn't you come sooner!" The Communist Party's control of Gaoyou for nearly a year has resulted in the loss of popular support. I hope that all parties, factions, and social leaders will come to Gaoyou to see the real public opinion of the so-called "liberated areas."</p>
<p>I toured the city for a week. The scene in Gaoyou city was much better than in Shaobo because Shaobo had experienced a fierce battle and suffered more damage. Gaoyou had little damage. Except for a portion of the strong men who were coerced and taken away, the rest of the people were still at home. Wherever we went, the people gathered around us, talking to us with great excitement, joy, and warmth. They told us many things that we could not have imagined. They hated the Communist Party to the extreme. An old woman in her seventies said to me: My son had a bicycle. One day, "Fourth Master" came to my house and insisted on taking it away. I refused to let go. I said: Don't you talk about democracy? Why don't you reason? My son was taken away by you to sacrifice, and he left this bicycle, which I want to keep as a souvenir. You can't bear to take it away. Before I could finish speaking, they threatened me with guns. I didn't care about anything and stood up and said: Okay! Shoot me! I can't live anyway. As a result, they shot a shot in the sky and didn't take it away. This happened several times. Sir! Do you think they are good? If you don't come, the lives of our people will be over. The old woman said this while acting, like performing a play. Although we expressed our sympathy, we could only comfort her with empty words. In short, every person truly hated the Communist Party to the extreme, wishing they could eat their flesh and sleep on their skin.</p>
<p>Afterwards, it was said that after the fall of Shaobo, the Communist army still wanted to hold Gaoyou and had gathered more than two thousand laborers overnight to strengthen the fortifications inside and outside the city. On the evening of the 7th, Su Yu's First Division, with more than ten thousand people, had already passed through Xinghua to reinforce Gaoyou, but before they reached Ergou, Gaoyou was recovered by us and it was too late to rescue it. Gaoyou city was spared the calamity of artillery fire. At the same time, it was said that there were more than a thousand people on the red list who were planned to be slaughtered, but thanks to our rapid advance, they were spared from disaster. This was truly fortunate.</p>
<p>After the recovery of Gaoyou, the National Army's pursuit troops headed towards Xinghua in one direction and advanced along the Grand Canal towards Baoying in the other, like sweeping away dead leaves with an autumn wind, and reached Baoying on the 11th. The entire Grand Canal line was completely cleared.</p>
<p>At 9:00 a.m. on the 20th, we still took a gunboat to Sishui, and then returned to Gaoyou by car. After returning, I saw the newspaper of the 19th, which published the CCP's statement on the current situation issued in Yan'an on the 17th, which did everything possible to slander and vilify, full of lies, which is not worth criticizing. However, what we have seen with our own eyes in the recovered areas, and the CCP's statement, is really ridiculous, pitiful, and hateful! They usually rely on their so-called million regular troops and more than two million militiamen to rebel and carry out internal strife, seizing cities and land, and attacking the National Army everywhere. When the National Army counterattacks slightly, they are defeated miserably and realize that their belief in force is not enough, so they shout for a ceasefire! Ceasefire! Unconditional ceasefire! The government is generous and allows a ceasefire, but they put forward unreasonable demands, making peace impossible. Today, they claim to have made so-called eight concessions and propose to restore credibility and integrity. I really don't know how they can be so shameless. Especially shameless is that they talk about the interests of the people and the demands of the people, as if the people are their patent. Drowning tens of thousands, massacring tens of thousands, and enslaving tens of thousands, is this also in the interests of the people? Is this also the demand of the people? That's right! The demand of the people is that the government quickly eliminates you, a bunch of traitors who harm the country and the people!</p>
<p>Finally, they shamelessly said: "We have no other demands, we only ask to restore the military positions of the KMT and the Communist Party on January 13." That's right! We can do it, we are willing to do it, because we are the country's army, and we can be transferred to any place at will. However, we really have to ask the people, ask the people in the so-called "liberated areas," and it is best to invite Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai to northern Jiangsu to ask, especially Mr. Zhou Enlai, who is from northern Jiangsu, and the transportation is very convenient now. He can take the opportunity to see his own hometown. As long as one person in northern Jiangsu says they are good, welcomes them, and wants us to leave, we will definitely ask the government to transfer us away and let them restore the positions of January 13. CCP people! Wake up! Stop dreaming, lay down your butcher knives and become Buddhas on the spot, this is your real way out!</p>

<h3>We Need A Municipal Drama School</h3>
<p>— Tao Xiong</p>
<p>We need a municipal drama school, a municipal drama school must exist, because it is an educational institution that cultivates social education talents! It is also a training ground that will train countless teachers for society! So we need it!</p>
<p>People from the municipal drama school will be the movers who promote the giant wheel of the times! They are the driving force for promoting social progress; they are the leaders who guide countless compatriots who have not received school education into the realm of "propriety, justice, integrity, and shame"; they are the soul of the nation, the teachers of the people; they are the ones who correct social customs; they are also the ones who lead people into a normal life. The municipal drama school trains them, educates them, its significance and function exceeds any other school!</p>
<p>The municipal drama school is about to be cut, the reason being to save the monthly expenses of three hundred thousand and some thousand to start a national school. This can be said: not to be a reason! Could it be that Shanghai's only municipal drama school can be cut to rob Peter to pay Paul?</p>
<p>We need a municipal drama school! A municipal drama school must exist! Especially standing from our own standpoint in film and drama, so we need it even more! We hope that the municipal drama school can be retained!</p>
<h3>New Movie Miscellaneous Reviews</h3>
<p>— Ma Boliang</p>
<p>1.  Lost Horizon</p>
<p>Among American directors, Lubitsch and Cukor are really not worth mentioning. Hitchcock of "Rebecca", Julian Duvivier of "The Great Waltz" and "Tales of Manhattan", Renoir Clair of "It Happened Tomorrow" and Capra of this film have our favorite characteristics. We once thought that American films should return from splendor to plainness. This kind of style can be seen in "The Human Comedy", "Lady Hamilton", and "The Story of G.I. Joe" during the war, which was due to the lessons of the disasters of war. Hitchcock and the other two had an even deeper trend, but Capra was the first to start with a plain life. The title "Lost Horizon" is far better than "Lost Horizon". Here, there are clear floating clouds in the blue sky, but there is no dusty dream of life. It is such a cliché story. The same themes are "Lady for a Day" and "Springtime in the Rockies". The difference is that Capra's play has a full human touch, and it criticizes the capitalist class with a bravery that is unprecedented in Hollywood. He pursues a kind of self-sufficient and happy physical and mental state. I really like the commoner families depicted by Capra, the people who are content with their lot, and the embarrassment revealed when the hypocritical bourgeoisie suddenly arrives. How much exaggeration is contained in the director's technique, but in the scene where the young couple makes a big scene in the hotel, the nature of the exaggeration is also a kind of cheerful joy. The old cripple raising the sign to throw something is a delicate and touching proof. The only flaw is that we dare not agree with the arms dealer's awakening. He should have more anger at the old cripple's instruction, and then more reflection. All the actors' skills are perfect. Jean Arthur's beauty is clear and beautiful. Perhaps the bad thing is that her voice is slightly hoarse. Perhaps it saves the sentimentality of the characters in the play too much, but we just like this confusion and sincerity of the world.</p>
<p>2.  I'll Be Seeing You</p>
<p>I have always regarded love as thin as autumn clouds, but this play tells me the truth and beauty of love, contacting life with each other under understanding. I believe that this is the only way to happiness. Botel has a kind of sadness, the quiet of the lakeside walk and the revelry of the New Year's ball, all faintly have the bleakness of the silent winter dusk. Although it is a legendary story like "Intermezzo", the difference is that there is a lot of human touch. The warmth of the American small town family shown by the Babela family of three, there are many beautiful pictures, the innkeeper leading Zack into the bedroom, Zack's neurotic attack, the small talk by the lake, the prison meeting, all have poetic and picturesque charm. It is lovely to play. Qin Qiu Luoji Si Jiao Wan is better than before, with a delicate style. Joseph Cotton is steady, and Shirley Temple plays a half-understood little girl, sincere and moving, better when she is mischievous than when she cries. Going home after the play, I still remember the crisp knocks of the rain on the streetlights, so harmonious, it is the flavor of this play.</p>
<p>3.  The Princess and the Pirate</p>
<p>A comedy is an extreme dream of a wandering story. This time, it takes pirates and princesses as the object of finding happiness. Although comedian Bob Hope is nothing more than those old routines, after all, it is not hard comedy of fist and foot. "The Princess and the Pirate" probably has five times more humor than "The Ghost Breakers". Seeking a relaxed feeling, I got a happy laugh. But when I came out, I even forgot Ginny Simms' smile. The prominent ending can prove the screenwriter's efforts. Goldwyn and his director are at least a little serious.</p>
<h3>About "Passionnellement"</h3>
<p>— Lin</p>
<p>This is another masterpiece by James Hilton that MGM turned into a film. His "Lost Horizon" and "Goodbye, Mr. Chips" have been praised unanimously after being put on the silver screen. Recently, "Random Harvest" has also been shown and has been well received. In "Passionnellement", Hilton writes about a mental patient who commits murder based on his abnormal psychology. This person who escaped from the madhouse has a very beautiful wife. But he suspects that his friend is having an affair with his wife, and finally designs a meticulously planned suicide, falsely blaming his friend. The intricate plot unfolds in this way.</p>
<p>The heroine of "Passionnellement", Ingrid Bergman, is a popular star known as the modern Garbo. Like Garbo, she is Swedish, gentle and beautiful. The two male protagonists are Robert Montgomery and George Sanders, who is good at playing detective films.</p>
<h3>Ouyang Fei Ying will go to North America</h3>
<p>— Jiang Niao</p>
<p>Ouyang Fei Ying, the heroine in "Ying Fei Ren Jian", is a singer who has just appeared on the screen. She has a charming voice and a healthy body, which makes her have a loud and pleasant singing voice. She is very kind to people and very generous in handling things. She often says to people: She didn't even think about appearing on the screen this time. Before the audition, she didn't even know how to make a movie, and she hadn't even seen it. Therefore, she dared not predict the success or failure of this time. She only hopes that after the screening, she will get more instructions from the outside world and senior gentlemen!</p>
<p>Her words are so modest and kind. In fact, it is impossible for her to fail in "Ying Fei Ren Jian", because of her own efforts and humble learning. However, because she has no experience in acting, she still has a little fault in dialogue, that is, she does not pay attention to the pause and interval when speaking!</p>
<p>She is a new talent in the film industry, and she has all the technical conditions required for film: she can ride a horse, swim, and shoot a gun; she can also do other things that people can play well, such as riding a bicycle, dancing, playing ball, Peking opera, and driving a car. Recently, she has received her passport and will leave for the United States in mid-December to study her own music in more depth. I hope that she will really learn something back from abroad, so that these friends who love music and film and drama will have more strength!</p>
<h3>Truth and Justice</h3>
<p>— Yu Fu</p>
<p>Watching "The Life of Emile Zola"</p>
<p>Zola's life can be clearly divided into two periods: the former period he lived in poverty, and the latter period he lived in affluence. In the former, he saved Nana. In the latter, he saved Captain Alfred Dreyfus. Both of these were expressions of his sense of justice, but the way they were expressed was different from his feelings at the time: when he was poor, he automatically saved Nana without hesitation. When he was living in affluence, he no longer had that impulsive energy. When Mrs. Dreyfus came to him, he only refused at first, and then doubted, because it was out of doubt that he discovered that Dreyfus had really been wronged, and then he wrote the famous article "J'Accuse!".</p>
<p>Under the contrast of these two senses of justice, it makes me think that people living in poverty and hardship are more rich in noble sympathy, and people living in comfortable and affluent environments only know selfishness, only know hypocrisy, have no pity, have no sympathy; they are afraid that misfortune will be transmitted to them, will break their happy lives, so they would rather live an ordinary life day by day until their hair turns white, until they walk into the grave, and are unwilling to extend great sympathy to save others' misfortune! Therefore, when you are unfortunate and want to ask for help, you must first see clearly the other party's environment and his personality, and don't act rashly. Otherwise, you will fail!</p>
<p>Zola finally discovered the truth of an innocent unfortunate person, because he was once a poor man, so he still has a sense of justice. Therefore, he stood on his position without hesitation to expose the darkness of the powerful, to tell the misfortune and pain of the humiliated, and to challenge the evil forces!</p>
<p>The slaves of the powerful judged that he had lost the case, and the blind masses attacked him. This cannot indicate that he does not conform to the trend, nor can it indicate that he has lost the hearts of the people, nor can it indicate his mistake! It only shows his strong will and great personality! It also shows that he is always standing on the side of truth!</p>
<p>When the savior Jesus was alive, he suffered all kinds of hardships, and his fate could not escape being nailed to the cross, let alone Zola! But truth is always truth, and it finally follows justice!</p>
<h3>Blue Skies</h3>
<p>— Xin Ming</p>
<p>This is a message that makes people excited. Paramount has invested three million dollars to produce this colorful musical blockbuster "Blue Skies". Because the film is a collaboration between Bing Crosby, the king of song, and Fred Astaire, the king of dance, for the second time (the city has already shown "Holiday Inn"), and Astaire announced during the filming that he would bid farewell to the film industry after the completion of this film. Therefore, he used all his skills in this film; he also introduced four new dance styles to his fans.</p>
<p>As for the king of song's plays, they still cannot escape the original style. As many as twenty-one intoxicating bass songs. The composer is Irving Berlin, a famous figure, and the peony green leaves complement each other.</p>
<h3>The two protagonists in MGM's new film "Undercurrent": Katharine Hepburn and George Sanders.</h3>
<h3>The First Domestically Produced Song and Dance Film: "Orioles Fly in the World"</h3>
<p>— Hu Tian</p>
<p>Since its restoration after the war, China Electric Studio Two has already presented its first domestically produced film, "A Family of Loyalty and Righteousness." Now, they are about to show us the first domestically produced song and dance film, "Orioles Fly in the World." This film has a very good theme: art belongs to the people and should not be the exclusive privilege of a few leisure-class individuals.</p>
<p>The story is about an artist in an ivory tower who trains a talented female singer. She relies on her beautiful voice and public performances in theaters, where ticket prices are quite expensive. Many people who cannot afford tickets can only look at advertisements outside the theater. By chance, she meets a poor male musician who hopes she can sing unconditionally to the poor in impoverished neighborhoods in front of a large audience. She happily agrees and invests in organizing a singing group for them. She also changes her name and goes out to sing beautiful songs for the people, so that her music can be heard by anyone and is no longer the exclusive privilege of gentlemen in theaters. However, her teacher discovers this and tries to stop her charitable singing. His female disciple resists, causing him to become angry and commit suicide. This, in turn, makes her even more determined and strengthens her resolve to sing for the poor!</p>
<p>Although the story is very simple, the director is able to use many</p>
<p>song and dance scenes to make the plot very lively. I met the director, Fang Peilin, a few days ago, and learned that the entire film has twelve insert songs and eight song and dance scenes, and that Li Ailei was invited to participate in the dance performances. I myself went to visit the filming of several ballet scenes and found the sets to be truly magnificent, especially the scenes that use reflections. In one scene, a row of more than a dozen female dancers, all dressed in white costumes, are singing and dancing on the stage. Below the stage is a pool of water, and when the lights shine brightly, the reflections of the dancers on the stage are clearly visible in the water. It's truly beautiful!</p>
<p>I have seen several American Hollywood Technicolor song and dance films and feel that their work is really good because their machinery and technology can help them succeed. After seeing the production process of a Chinese song and dance film this time, I feel that our work has a different kind of charm: although some parts cannot keep up with foreign works, the director's ingenuity, his ability to use clever shots and angles, and to make the most of the current sets and simple machinery are commendable!</p>
<p>Fortunately, this film will be shown to us within this week, and its success or failure is up to us to decide.</p>

<h3>A Record of Two Literary and Art Tea Parties</h3>
<p>— Jin Shan</p>
<p>Some friends gave me this topic after I attended the literary and art tea party at the Five-Story Restaurant last Sunday. Over the years, whether teaching or editing publications, I only knew how to give topics for others to write about, and I didn't know the pain of writing about a given topic. Well, now I've encountered it. Fortunately, it's not an exam where I have to hand in a paper immediately, otherwise, I'd definitely get a zero. But it doesn't matter if I get a zero; who relies on grades to eat these days? But this is a friend's commission, a request of friendship, and a piece of ardent expectation, so this is difficult.</p>
<p>I am someone who hasn't learned anything well and doesn't understand anything. I勉强can say that the only thing I know a little about is emotions, and the reason I am so frustrated and have accomplished nothing is also because of these emotions. Taking friendship as an example, I wouldn't be like some people, going through the motions and being perfunctory. So my heart is often locked up by loneliness. However, I believe that "birds sing for companions" is a true exchange of emotions, and I felt and confirmed this again at these recent two literary and art tea parties.</p>
<p>One is the "Saturday Literary Tea Gathering." The origins of this gathering can be traced back to Mr. Zhong Ming's "Friendship Between Intellectuals and Political Relations" published in the Spring and Autumn in September. That article prompted responses from Mr. Hua Lin and Mr. Hong Wei, and Mr. Hua's concrete suggestions turned into active practice.</p>
<p>One day, Mr. Hua ran over excitedly and said, "I've got it! I've found a place: Xiangxue Garden!" Of course, I understand Mr. Hua's enthusiasm and experience. Before the war, he ran the "Literary Club" in Nanjing, and during the war, he ran the "Saturday Evening Tea" in Chongqing. So we discussed inviting friends and publicizing the news.</p>
<p>A few days later, Mr. Xu Zhongnian came to talk about restoring the "Literary Tea Party." I told him about Mr. Hua's plan, and he understood. He said, "It just so happens that the times and locations of the two tea parties are different, so they can coexist without conflict." I thought, that's right, isn't everyone in Shanghai worried about the inconvenience of meeting friends? Wouldn't it be better to have more opportunities to meet? So we discussed inviting friends and issuing invitations for this tea party.</p>
<p>A few days later, Mr. Hua sent the invitation card for the first tea gathering, and I published it in the Spring and Autumn as well.</p>
<p>I went to participate on the afternoon of October 19th. Xiangxue Garden turned out to be a bamboo fence and thatched hut-style building, located in a corner of a sanatorium's garden. In the center of the hall was Mr. Wu Zhihui's calligraphy, "Literary Tea Gathering," and at the entrance was Ms. Zhou Lianxia's couplet, "As long as two hearts understand each other, what does it matter if there is no lamp or moon?" Classical gauze lanterns hung high on the roof, and canna lilies outside the window, with a hint of melancholy, were scattered in the western breeze and slanting sun. Participants each had a cup of tea, sipping slowly, appreciating the taste of finding tranquility in the midst of noise. Perhaps because of the architecture and facilities, which all have an Eastern rural flavor, it reminded people of Daoxiang Village in "Dream of the Red Chamber" or the Green Willow Village on the Slender West Lake. The only pity was the lack of a stream and the sound of oars.</p>
<p>I left early that day. I saw Mr. Liu Haisu, Mei Qi, Zhu Ying, Guan Liang, Zhong Xianmin, and the host, Mr. Hua Lin, etc. Everyone gathered freely, without any formality. They talked about literature, painting, people, and ghosts…</p>
<p>The second time was on October 26th. This time, the participants included Shi Zhecun, Dai Wangshu, Xu Shiqi, Huang Huanwu, Mr. Liu Shi, Mr. Sun Fuxi, and Mr. Hua Lin. It was rare that Mr. Zhang Chuandao, one of the founders of "Yu Si," happened to be in Shanghai, and he came with Mr. Li Xiaofeng.</p>
<p>Of course, there was another exchange of friendship, humorous wit, and enthusiastic greetings. Everyone talked and laughed until the sun set and dusk gradually covered the window screen. Everyone seemed to feel that they hadn't talked enough. But we can meet again at the literary tea party tomorrow. Everyone thought this in their hearts and slowly dispersed.</p>
<h3>Goddess of the Luo River</h3>
<p>— Ming Qiu Shizhou</p>
<p>The restoration of the "Literary Tea Party" can be considered Mr. Zhongnian's personal preparation, just as the literary tea gathering is Mr. Hua's sole operation. As far as I know, he ran around for more than three weeks, and even the invitation card published in the Spring and Autumn was written by Mr. Zhongnian himself. Although he specially introduced Mr. Chen Chengyin of the Changnian Qiansao Society at the meeting for his contribution in liaising, he also traced back to Mr. Sun Fuxi's initiation fourteen years ago, saying that it was Mr. Chuntai who caused the trouble, and also thanked Spring and Autumn for publishing the invitation card this time.</p>
<p>The Five-Story Restaurant is fully equipped with modern facilities, with high steel windows draped with beige silk curtains, dark green velvet soft chairs, and a smooth floor. However, the enthusiasm and leisurely mood of the participants were no different from those in Xiangxue Garden. That day, it was so crowded that it seemed there was no room for latecomers to stand.</p>
<p>At the gathering, Mr. Sun Fuxi, in his capacity as the original troublemaker, reported several witty and humorous stories about his ten years of separation and exile in the Great Rear Area. Mr. Hua Lin spoke about the three stages of life: loving parents in childhood, loving lovers in adulthood, and loving friends in middle and old age, explaining that the most precious thing for human beings is friendship, and that politics is only a kind of responsibility that citizens have towards the country. Therefore, he hoped that everyone would participate often and become good friends together. His words happened to echo Mr. Zhong Ming's article. Indeed, look at this gathering, whether new friends or old, everyone shakes hands and smiles, and who doesn't feel deeply connected?</p>
<p>Mr. and Mrs. Wang Yaliao, as well as Mr. Xu Weinan, had left beforehand, and Mr. Yan Duhe was always smiling. Mr. Ma Gongyu talked while stroking his beard.</p>
<p>That day, Mr. Liu Shi also reported with sorrow about the desolate situation after Mr. Chen Bao's death. Mr. Xu Xiaotian immediately expressed his deep concern, and for a moment, everyone felt infinite sympathy and prepared to find ways to provide relief to the family in distress.</p>
<p>Among those present were elders with gray hair and unkempt celebrities; there were elegant and refined painters, as well as writers in neat suits; there were graceful and luxurious women, as well as charming young girls; there were famous literary seniors, as well as young people who love literature and art: different identities, different clothing, were naturally harmonized in the common literary atmosphere. I believe that when everyone left the meeting, their hearts were filled with freedom, harmony, and joy.</p>
<p>—Writing to here and reading it again from the beginning, I realize that I have only written some superficial impressions. I think that if Mr. Zhao Jingshen were at the meeting, his vivid writing would be much better than this rough record. What to do? I still can't turn in the paper. But it's a small matter if I can't turn in the paper; it would be terrible to fail the trust and expectations of my friends.—Well, let it be published, so that friends from other places who care about us can know a general idea first.</p>
<h3>Street Scene</h3>
<p>— Ye Hong</p>
<p>Around eight o'clock in the morning, there are already twenty people standing at the tram stop.</p>
<p>Everyone is anxiously waiting for the tram, almost all stretching their necks and casting their gaze into the distance. However, after a long time, they still can't see the shadow of the tram.</p>
<p>The sky is gloomy, and it looks like it's going to rain.</p>
<p>A small jeep carrying several gaudily dressed women speeds past, leaving behind a gust of "fragrant wind." The small jeep speeds away.</p>
<p>Finally, a trolleybus slowly crawls over like a beetle. From ten feet away, you can already see that the car is packed with people.</p>
<p>As soon as the tram arrives at the station, the ticket seller at the door, who is not wearing a hat, is about to blow the whistle when several soldier elders inside shout loudly</p>
<p>"Open the door, open the door now!"</p>
<p>The ticket seller can't help it and has to open the door. After the soldier elders rush down, the people at the station rush up like a swarm, as if they are grabbing gold...</p>
<p>The ticket seller immediately uses all his skills, using his hands, feet, and mouth, desperately pushing the door while shouting at the top of his lungs:</p>
<p>"Don't be so fierce, okay? See for yourselves if you can fit in!"</p>
<p>The people rushing up seem not to hear and continue to rush up with their heads down...</p>
<p>Suddenly, someone in the car cries out:</p>
<p>"My money is gone! My money is gone!"</p>
<p>A bald young man squeezes out, holding an "empty" canvas bag, crying and shouting:</p>
<p>"Catch the thief!"</p>
<p>An old man at the station hurriedly walks over, concerned:</p>
<p>"How much money is gone?"</p>
<p>"Eight hundred thousand, eight hundred thousand, wa——" The young man bursts into tears.</p>
<p>The old man strokes his beard: "Sigh! What kind of world is this!"</p>
<p>The ticket seller sneers:</p>
<p>"Crying, what's the use of crying, is the thief waiting for you? Hurry back and tell your boss!" Saying that, he clenches his fist and hits the door twice with force, shouting:</p>
<p>"Open it!"</p>
<p>The tram is about to start, and there are still two people clinging to the door.</p>
<p>"How about waiting for the next one?" The ticket seller pushes the door tightly.</p>
<p>The two people ignore him and continue to cling.</p>
<p>This time, it makes the ticket seller furious. He uses all his strength to push the door: "Clatter!"</p>
<p>After a long, long time, another one comes. Before reaching the station, the ticket seller in the car blows the whistle deafeningly, and the tram speeds past.</p>
<p>More and more people are at the station, and the sky is getting darker and darker. It's about to rain.</p>
<h3>Balzac Eats Painted Cakes</h3>
<p>Honoré de Balzac (1799–1850), the founder of French realism, was also a famous visionary. It is said that when he was young, he only ate some water-soaked bread every day, but he didn't think it was bitter. He often drew pictures of pastries and food on the table with chalk. When the urge came, he would chew voraciously, and he would feel as if he was eating delicacies.</p>
<h3>An Inch of Rivers and Mountains, an Inch of Blood 81</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>I looked at my watch and it was already past six o'clock. I then tidied myself up a bit and woke up Tiger, telling him about the situation here and asking him if he wanted to eat anything else. He was drowsy for a while before shaking his head. His nostrils were stinging. I knew it was the effect of the fumes. I called him to get ready quickly and leave this place. Coincidentally, that old bumpkin's wife walked in at this time, clapping her hands and laughing, saying, "You two brothers, what did you do yesterday?" She said she had come in two or three times, but seeing us sleeping so soundly, she didn't dare to disturb us. She also asked us if we wanted to eat in the main hall or if we wanted her to make something for us. We told her that we wanted to go for a walk and that if there was official business, we would have to hurry back to the city.</p>
<p>We passed through the kitchen and walked into the aisle behind the "Hall of Seeking Talent." I felt a chill on my body and my nostrils were clear. I felt much more comfortable. There were two paper-covered window grilles in the aisle that led to the main hall of the Hall of Seeking Talent. The paper on the window grilles had many small holes. The buzzing of voices, loud shouts, and small cries all came from here. We walked to the window and peeked inside. Just as we put our eyes close, a stench wafted out—opium, cigarettes, sweat, people, all mixed with an indescribable strange smell!</p>
<p>From this window hole, only a corner of the hall can be seen. The various details of this corner, I think, even if a painter tries to describe it vividly, can't capture the mood of the people. Men: Japanese, Koreans, Chinese, each and every one either looked like fierce gods or were exuding the decadent aura of someone who was poisoned. Women, if the Rakshasa Kingdom really exists, I think they were all transplanted from the Rakshasa Kingdom. As for their vulgar and outrageous behavior, it's impossible to describe clearly. This is probably a living hell, and it's also probably a kind of paradise that the Japanese invaders created for traitors and lackeys!</p>
<p>We wanted to analyze the people in the hall and make a statistical comparison, but Tiger suddenly gave me a signal. It turned out that someone from the kitchen was carrying a large tray of soup and dishes and passing through here. I quickly pretended to be nonchalant and left the aisle.</p>
<p>To get from the old house to the headquarters in the street district, you have to take the main road and go back to the arched gate, then enter the locked entrance. Thinking that there would be strict guards inside the entrance, we prepared to walk through the backyard of the old village and find a way to get past. We determined the direction and walked along the back of the flat houses along the edge of the old village. At this time, the sky was already dark, but we were carefully avoiding obstacles and exploring the way forward. There were various obstacles separating the old village from the headquarters. Some were ten feet high, some were layers of barbed wire, interspersed with thorns. Some were seven or eight feet high, and the thorns were arranged densely, making it impossible to see what was on the other side. This area had only a small path, and the tiles and stones along the street looked as if no one had ever stepped on them.</p>
<p>When we reached the back of the old village, it was a chaotic forest, desolate and unbearable, like a messy tomb, uneven, and the ground was covered with thorns, wild vines, and weeds, making it impossible to set foot. Tiger suggested that he pick a tree and climb to the top to get a general view and then make a plan. But at this time, I was thinking that it was better to try the main road, because I predicted that it would be impossible to pass through this area at all. Even if we get past these obstacles, we don't know what the situation is on the other side. But there's no harm in looking from the tree.</p>
<p>Tiger tidied himself up a bit and picked a taller tree to climb up. After a while, he came down and told me that he was afraid we couldn't cross over on this side. If we crossed over the obstacles, there would only be a ten-foot-wide ditch on the other side, with a stone wall on the opposite bank, only one person high, and it would be easy to cross over. He said he saw that the main road at the entrance had to cross a bridge, and he was afraid that the guards there would be strict, making it difficult to approach.</p>
<p>I hesitated for a while and discussed it with Tiger again. We decided to try to cross over the obstacles. Because, according to the defensive arrangement, the more dangerous the obstacles, the less strict the defense must be. As long as we overcome this obstacle, it is the main road. I also tidied myself up a bit, took out the small sword I was carrying, and handed it to Tiger, letting him lead the way, because his eyes were sharp and he had some martial arts skills. Although we were careful, we still had our clothes torn and several small cuts on the back of our hands. It took us half an hour to break through this obstacle. Tiger handed the sword back to me, saying that this small sword was much sharper than the small knife he got from the Japanese invaders.</p>

<p>— Shaofu</p>
<p>Probably because I often quote sentences from the Bible, many readers have written to ask if I am a Christian. Here, I can answer these enthusiastic friends: I am a Christian, but after leaving school, I have never been to church once and have no contact with the church. I am a worshiper of education and can also say that I am quite interested in the study of the Bible. My interest lies in philosophy and literature. Because this book is philosophical and literary (especially the Psalms).</p>
<p>At the same time, some readers have written to say that this publication "praises Christian works and often criticizes Buddhism," etc. This is definitely not true. If it is said that I rarely quote or introduce Buddhist classics, then that is because of my lack of understanding. I dare not make amateur comments to make a fool of myself. As for "criticizing," I not only guarantee that there has been none in the past, but I can also guarantee that there will never be any in the future.</p>
<p>Religious freedom is a given today, and no one should have narrow prejudices and force others to believe the same thing. Moreover, the basic belief of any religion—to do good—is the same. Therefore, if one opposes Buddhism because of belief in Christianity, or opposes Christianity because of belief in Buddhism, that is not the most wise and magnanimous attitude.</p>
<p>In the summer of the thirty-third year (1944), in Chongqing, I went to Beibei Jinyun Mountain to visit Master Tailu. His calm and tranquil demeanor, even though I am not a Buddhist disciple, still lingers in my mind today. I know that it is due to profound religious education. This impression has constantly stimulated me and led me to study the classics.</p>
<p>I have answered truthfully as above. I wonder if these enthusiastic friends can understand?</p>
<p>Fairy Tales for Adults</p>
<h3>The Original Form Appears</h3>
<p>— Wen Hua</p>
<p>It is said that the following joke is currently circulating in Europe:</p>
<p>Once, an airliner carrying many passengers of different nationalities was flying over the Atlantic Ocean. During the voyage, a part of the aircraft's machinery suddenly broke down and could not be repaired. So the pilot immediately announced that the weight on the plane had to be reduced, otherwise it would not be able to reach a safe place. So the passengers had no choice but to sacrifice all their luggage and mailbags and throw them into the sea one by one. However, the load was still too heavy and the plane was sinking. At this point, a Frenchman immediately stood up and delivered a beautiful and passionate speech, the gist of which was that for the safety and happiness of all passengers, as well as the brotherhood of mankind, someone should sacrifice themselves and jump off the plane to save others. However, in the spirit of freedom and equality, these heroes should not be forced, but should voluntarily come out to complete this great undertaking. At this time, a Japanese passenger, hearing about suicide, was greatly moved and immediately walked forward without hesitation, opened the door, shouted "Long live the Emperor!" and jumped down.</p>
<p>The second was a German, who also shouted "Heil Hitler!" and jumped down, but then opened a parachute.</p>
<p>Then an Italian passenger shouted "Long live Mussolini!" walked to the door but hesitated again and again and didn't jump. A British gentleman walked up to him, recited "God save the King!" and pushed the Italian down.</p>
<p>After that, no one volunteered anymore, but the plane was still sinking and had to reduce weight. So everyone gathered in a pile and started a meeting. After repeated discussions, it was decided that whoever was the heaviest should go down. At this time, a large Russian man immediately backed out and shouted "Veto!" (Vets!) refusing to agree.</p>
<p>While everyone was looking at each other blankly and helpless, an American suddenly stood up very generously and said, "Whoever is willing to jump down, I am willing to pay $1,000!" At this time, the Jew, hearing this, immediately stood up and said, "If you can pay me $2,000, and in cash (in cash), I will voluntarily go down." The American was overjoyed and hurriedly took out his wallet to pay when a Chinese businessman, who had been silent until now in the corner, quietly reached out to the Jew and said, "Since you are about to jump down, you should leave the money in my care!"</p>
<p>Weekly Miscellany: Calendar Revolution</p>
<h3>—Overthrow the Current Calendar</h3>
<p>— De Cai</p>
<p>The latest calendar: The current Gregorian calendar is extremely irregular, seems to have no discipline, and lacks the meaning of the word "calendar." Now I propose a new calendar:</p>
<p>The year is still divided into four seasons;</p>
<p>Each season has three months, totaling twelve months in a year;</p>
<p>Among the twelve months: six odd months: January, March, May, July, September, November, etc.; six even months: February, April, June, August, October, December, etc.;</p>
<p>Odd months have 31 days each (odd month, odd number), large months;</p>
<p>Even months have 30 days each (even month, even number), small months.</p>
<p>The whole year has 366 days (standard year, which is actually the current leap year).</p>
<p>Ordinary years reduce one day in January.</p>
<p>The first day of the standard year is called the Standard Day;</p>
<p>July 1st of each year falls exactly in the center of the first and second halves of the year and can be called the "Day of Central Justice." The names of the four seasons of the year are spring, summer, autumn, and winter.</p>
<p>In the current Gregorian calendar, spring is in December, January, and February; summer is in March, April, and May; autumn is in June, July, and August; winter is in September, October, and November. This violates the discipline, spirit, and meaning of the seasons. We can move all the current months forward by one month. February is changed to January, and so on. In this way, spring is January, February, and March; summer is April, May, and June; autumn is July, August, and September; winter is October, November, and December. Or we can change the definition of the English month names: December is January, and so on, and November year thirty day has become New Year's Eve.</p>
<p>The standard day of the standard year happens to fall on a Monday. It occurs four times every twenty-eight years, but there is only one year that can be coordinated with the weekly rotation table. This year is obviously the leader of the four standard years and can be called the "Unified Year."</p>
<p>Modifying the current calendar in this way both accommodates reality and is extremely scientific in calculation, and easier to remember. I tentatively name it: "Disciplined New Gregorian Calendar." I also hope that it will become the "New World Calendar" in the future. If there are any English experts, I hope they can translate it and send it to foreign magazines and newspapers to provide it for everyone to discuss.</p>
<h3>Eternally the Same</h3>
<p>— Wu You</p>
<p>I remember when I was in middle school, I discussed the reform of the calendar with my classmates at an evening party. At that time, I whimsically proposed a novel "new calendar." In short, this "new calendar" is like this:</p>
<p>A year is divided into four seasons; each season has three months; each month has three "weeks"; each "week" has ten days. (The system of "weekdays" is abolished, and the term "weekday" is, in fact, naturally no longer applicable. Even the term "week" is not appropriate, and a proper name is yet to be determined.) A year is originally three hundred and sixty-five days, plus a few hours and some minutes. The above twelve months only account for three hundred and sixty days, leaving five days plus a fraction. These days do not belong to any month, so they are arranged as follows: four days are respectively placed at the beginning of each of the four seasons, named "Spring Day," "Summer Day," "Autumn Day," and "Winter Day." The remaining day plus a fraction is placed at the end of the year, named "Year-End Day."</p>
<p>I can barely come up with many reasons and advantages for this "new calendar." Here is a brief description of the more important ones:</p>
<p>First, it is fixed, without exceptions, eternally the same, simple and clear, and easy to calculate. Second, it is suitable for general habits and needs in personnel matters. Each season and the end of each year have a blank day, which is independent and very effective. (In principle, "X Season Day" and "Year-End Day" are all rest days, which can be used to review and settle the past stage and plan and budget for the next stage, without interfering with ordinary days.) Third, the weekly day off, which occurs every seven days, is changed to a "Weekend Day" off every ten days. Because the New Year has a "Weekend Day," a "Year-End Day," and a "Spring Day" - three consecutive holidays - there is no need for a separate New Year's holiday. There are many other similar situations. This is very beneficial to "efficiency." For example, the time from elementary school to university graduation can be shortened from sixteen years (referring to my country's current school system) to fifteen years. Similarly, administrative efficiency and industrial productivity can be deduced.</p>
<p>This so-called "new calendar" is indeed new, but unfortunately, it lacks academic basis. I wonder if it is correct?</p>
<h3>I Want to Get Married!</h3>
<p>— Ren</p>
<p>Youth Problems</p>
<p>I am not trying to place a marriage advertisement here to find a marriage partner. However, I believe that there must be many women currently encountering the same difficulties as me, definitely not just me alone. Therefore, I want to bring up this problem that has been accumulating in my mind for a long time and cannot be solved, for discussion.</p>
<p>I am a twenty-five-year-old unmarried woman. According to the ancient saying "a woman should marry when she is of age," it is time for me to get married. But what is unusual is that I do not embrace spinsterhood. I desperately want to get married, but I have never had a marriage opportunity to consider in my life. I read the newspaper in the morning and see engagement and marriage announcements every day. Only I am among the crowd but abandoned outside the crowd, and I can never find a possible opportunity. In terms of education, I am a high school graduate, which is considered an intellectual. In terms of physique, I am strong. In terms of appearance, I am not necessarily inferior to people who are fortunate enough to get married. I really don't understand why no one wants to marry me.</p>
<p>The current marriage style has improved with the times and is in a period of "parents do not command, matchmakers are silent." The old style has been abolished, but obviously, there is no universal new style to replace it. China has not yet reached the civilized stage where "daughters are first introduced into society at sixteen" and must work hard on their own. Parents do not arrange marriages for their daughters when they are adults. How can they say to friends everywhere, "Please introduce me to some boyfriends so that I can have a chance to get married?" There are many people in the same predicament as me, around the same age, and with similar circumstances, waiting to get married. However, everyone keeps silent in words, but their spirits are unspokenly understood.</p>
<p>I am definitely not one of those women who think that marriage is the only way for women, nor do I regard marriage as an "escape route." But I myself (and I think many women like me) absolutely do not want to be old maids. The only way not to be an old maid is to get married. To get married, there must be a partner. Where should I find a partner?</p>
<p>Some people may say, "Go out and do things, and you will naturally meet more people, and then you will have opportunities?" But how many institutions in Shanghai can a high school graduate strive for, besides elementary school teachers and female typists? And in these institutions, if there are not more women than men, then most of the male employees are already married. I once read an article in the September issue of Coronet titled "How to Find a Husband," but the article is not applicable to China. I want to get married, but I am being forced by the environment to walk down the terrible path of "old maid." What should I do?</p>
<p>Shanghai Insider</p>
<h3>Dancers and Dance Halls 4</h3>
<p>— Jia Mo</p>
<p>The income of ordinary dancers is naturally not comparable to that of red stars. The difference between them is so large that it is enough to make outsiders gasp. Ordinary dancers (referring to those in second- and third-class dance halls who have seats and are doing well) have an average monthly income of about one million to one and a half million. Black stars who are in decline only have three or four hundred thousand per month. And the most miserable Guìhuā dancers have less than one hundred thousand per month. They have no monthly salary or base salary. There is no cost of living index to rely on. Their income is the converted amount of dance tickets and cash given by guests. The following table is based on inquiries to clarify this:</p>
<p>(Level) (Seat Type) (Dance Hall Type) (Average Monthly Income)</p>
<p>First-Class Red Star Non-Seated First-Class Dance Hall Over 8 million</p>
<p>Second-Class Red Star Non-Seated First-Class Dance Hall Over 5 million</p>
<p>Second-Class Red Star Non-Seated Second-Class Dance Hall Over 6 million</p>
<p>Third-Class Red Star Non-Seated Second-Class Dance Hall Over 1 million</p>
<p>Third-Class Red Star Non-Seated Third-Class Dance Hall Over 2 million</p>
<p>First-Class Dancer Seated First-Class Dance Hall Around 1 million</p>
<p>First-Class Dancer Seated Second-Class Dance Hall Over 2 million</p>
<p>Second-Class Dancer Seated Second-Class Dance Hall Over 1 million</p>
<p>Third-Class Dancer Seated Second-Class Dance Hall Under 800,000</p>
<p>Fourth-Class Dancer Seated Third-Class Dance Hall Under 400,000</p>
<p>Black Star Seated Third-Class Dance Hall Under 150,000</p>
<p>According to the above table, we found a very peculiar example, that is, the income of a third-class (at least) red star who is "non-seated" is often not as good as that of a seated dancer. Moreover, the average income of a first-class dancer in a second-class dance hall with a seat is actually higher than that of her sisters in a first-class dance hall. This is because most of the dancers who frequent first-class dance halls bring their own dance partners, or they call the red stars to sit with them, which makes it difficult for seated dancers to make a living. On the other hand, the seated dancers in second-class dance halls are more resourceful, and the dancers are all enthusiastic single men.</p>
<p>Those dancers who are frustrated in second- and third-class dance halls often run to other cities as a way to survive. However, since Nanjing and Hangzhou banned dancing, they have returned in a panic. Currently, the only other city is Hong Kong. Moreover, there must be sufficient preparation for travel and living expenses (about one million national currency). Therefore, there are not many who go to other cities.</p>
<p>Those dancers who are qualified as red stars live in an environment of temptation. Therefore, love affairs are endless, and marriages or cohabitations can be found at any time. They often suddenly declare their disappearance, because they have retreated to the golden house of a rich man. At the same time, rising stars continue to climb up from small dance halls. "The waves of the Yangtze River push the waves ahead." New dancers are constantly growing. Old dancers are constantly climbing up and constantly changing. This has created a deformed new profession for women in Shanghai. This has created the prosperity of the dance industry in Shanghai, a hedonistic and sensual distribution center. (The End)</p>
