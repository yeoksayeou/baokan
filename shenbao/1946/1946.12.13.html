<p>〔本報南京十二日電〕左舜十二日在中宣部招待會中，答覆有關國大　問題如次：問，青年　對憲草意見如何？答，政府提出之憲草，乃經過協商而成，青年黨意見雖未包括在憲草內，但青年黨支持此憲草。問，外傳靑年黨將參加改組政府，確否？答，政府改組，原則已確定，但事實尙未具體化，如已具　，我們亦將考慮參加與吾。問，憲草第一條己修改，尊意如伺？答，此條之通過，與原來協議意見有出入，靑年然是不反對三民主義原則的，靑年黨將支持原案，不贊同再修改，並非每一黨均不可修改，而是某些重要黨不能修改。問，民社黨發言人蔣勻田，昨日發表對憲草之意見，尊意如何？答，民社黨採取保留態度及留待大會時發表意見，比黠甚好，至蔣氏談話原文，本人尙未見到。問，國大通過憲法，如不爲靑年黨同意，靑年黨作何表示？答，本人相信，一部憲草決不能使每一黨對每一條都滿意，故有小的不滿意就算了。間，傳說中的國共談判，靑年黨感想如何？答，靑年黨一向希望和平，能談總是好的，如雙方需要靑年黨參加，則靑年黨自樂意參加。問，靑年黨李璜不參加國大，原因何在？答，李璜之參加國大，是與靑年黨其他代表之名單同時提出，黨時李氏並未表示不參加，李日已被選爲主席團之一，今李不來，實因彼個人之健康問題，與政治無關。問，請問對於　　問題之意見及蒙　胞所要求實行高度自治與保持盟旗制度之意見如何？答，我個人覺得憲草中原已馬定　民族一律平等，地方性自治，在範圍）的自治，甚表同情。關於盟旗制度、據悉，政府並無變更意思。至於高度自治，本人尚不明暸其性質如何。問，民盟羅隆　在金大演說，　爲政府向國大提出之憲草於政協不符，尊見如何？答，我尚未演說全文，憲草須經過修正，當然有不同之處，將來討論通過時，仍將有所不同，惟政協亦非最後決定稿，其最重要原則，希望不改變。問，中共對恢復和談的先決條件，是解散國大，尊意如何？答，我無意見。問，建都問題，靑年黨意見如何？答，主張不必規定地點。問，憲草中有幾點，是否絕對不能改變？答，（一）國大權限不能改得太大，（二）政院對立法院負賣一點，不能修改。問，黨草中重要原則，有何把握能在大會中通過？答，現正與各方交換意見，重要原則，我相信不會有何變更。</p>
<h3>第一審委會鄭重討論人民之權利義務　人民身體自由條文修改通過</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十二日電〕與人民最有切身關係之「人民之權利義務」一章，十二日上下午於憲草第一審委會鄭重討論。靑年黨，民社黨及其他代表，發言咸極踴躍，對有關權利義務之一字一句、皆審嶼推敲。原案第八條「中華民國人民，無男女宗敎種族及黨派之分，在法律上一律平等，「無與議通過，惟關係人民身體自由之第九條，各方特別重視，　推張知本，秦聯奎，牟震東，紀　　等五人先加整理。其後會中對警察機關是否有拘禁審問之　，復往返辯駁、最後將原案修正如下：</p>
<p>「人民身體之自由，應于保障，除現行犯之逮捕由法律另定外，非經司法或警察機關依法定程序不得逮捕拘禁，非由法院依法定程序不得審問‘處罰，非依法定程序之逮捅。拘禁，審問，處罰得拒絕之。</p>

<p>人民遭受任何　　非法逮捕徇禁時，其本人或他人，得向法院聲請追究，法院不得拒絕，並應於二十四小時向逮捕拘禁之　　追究，依法處理。「第十修至二十條，皆維持原案，雖曾有人主張增加於十一至十五條加：「非依法律不得限制之」字樣，然仍按原案通過。對信仰宗敎自由略有爭辯，惟亦仍持原案，修改者惟二十一條，該條原文爲「人民有依法律服兵役之　務」，現於兵役下加「及工役」三字。惟據若干代表表示，該案關係人民重大，大會中或仍將有人提出反對。</p>
<h3>第二審查委員會全日會議無結果</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十二日電〕憲草第二審委會，十二日整日開全體會，就整理後之修正意見加以討論，上午會　由王普涵主席，對第二十六條少數民族是否應單獨選舉國民代表一點爭辯極烈，最後決定將此問題　附紀錄提交綜合審委會解決。下午會議由會濟寬主席，各代表就第廿七條修正意見踴躍發言，一部主張將國民大會之選舉權。罷免權擴大及於五院院長，一部主張維持原案，裨重要　本之　歸國大，次要經常之權歸立院作補救，國大不能常設之　點一時議論紛紜，　然對　，至第廿六人發言時，己屈六時，會衆乃一哄而散，全日會議無結果。</p>

<p>〔中央社本市訊〕民盟常委沈鈞艦談，民盟中常會可能在滬召開。又稱，民盟目前並無組黨準備，至於恢復「民主政團同盟」，因盟員中個人多於團體，實亦不可能。</p>

<h3>國大權限問題民社黨提異議　青年黨聲明保留一切應有權利</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕民社黨發言入孫　毅十二晚稱；關於國大權限問題，民社黨之態度極爲堅定。國大　齊會既決定國大爲政權最高機關，則該黨退出國大，自極可能。因國大重開全體大會時，審查意見必相當重視也。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十二日電〕靑年黨代表周　三，十二日午後於第一審委會宣佈「本席　靑年黨代表團命令，有一簡單甲明，請紀錄。凡對於國民政府所提中華民國憲法章案，作原則之變更而又未經靑年黨代表同意者。靑年黨代表保留一切應有之權利」。</p>
<h3>第一審查會激辯結果建都北平案通過　將再提付綜合委會討論</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十二日電〕建都南北之爭，昨在憲草第一審會發生前　戰後，今日主力接觸，終引起一塲大風波，紛擾近半小時，最後提付表決，在塲一九二人，贊成建都北平者一一七人，超過半數，贊成建都南京者僅六十三人，惟南京代表劉百閔提出，根據主席團決議，審查會遇有相爭不決之案件時，應提交綜合委會；請主席將本案送綜合委會。又據召集人　少　於事後語記者，根據主席團決議，審委會　查結果，與原案原則相反者，應送綜合委會，是以該案他”仍將在綜委會討論，究竟定都北平抑維持原案仍以南京爲首都，現尙雖以說定。</p>
<p>今晨第一審會，由靑年黨夏爾康主席，河南代表張善與說明其主張以蘭州爲中都，南京爲東都，疏勒爲西都，提案之意見後，山東代表宋東岱即在北方代表熱烈鼓掌下，暢論建都北平理由，其　語爲「無北方即無中國」欲建現代化中國，非建都北平不可，建都南京有亡國危險，此種迷夢可以醒矣」！</p>
<p>南京代表不甘示弱，杜心如發言，說明對北方代表意見表欽佩後，則歸入正題，　國家安危　於政治設施與國防計劃者大，擊於首都者小，即就安撫　心而　，亦不一定非建都北平不可。</p>
<p>至是惹起風波之河北代表李荷起立發言，李首先聲明「兄弟少年氣盛，不免有冒犯之處」，旁觀者聞言後，即知一塲激辯必難避免。李於說明此事非「南北之爭」後，即駁斥劉百閔昨日所稱，「南京爲革命首都。抗戰首都，勝利首都」之說，據稱：總理革命　始於廣州，故眞正革命首都應爲廣州。至抗戰首都亦不爲南京，而應爲　慶，南京坐享革命成果，抗戰又先敗退，致在逆精衛建偽都於南京，故主建南京爲「紀念國恥首都」。斯　一出，北方代表咸大鼓掌，而南京代表則因侮辱過甚，首由王宜　起立指黃，特別指出。南京若爲「國恥首都」，將主席又何用還都南京，對其侮辱首都大表不滿，金嘉斐等亦提出質問，地方代表不侍言畢，即　起對質，同時發　者逾二十人，會堪人聲糟維，混亂情形實爲第一審查會開會以來所罕見，若干代表甚至高立議事桌上，足蹈手舞，杯　紙飛，堅主非嚴懲王宜聲不可，雖經召集人黃少谷。陳逸雲等高呼「請維持秩序」，並四處作揖，請各代表坐下。秩序仍難維持，過兩三分鐘後，各代表稍稍坐定，主席　爾康忽宣布「請未得主席允許擅自發言之代表退席」，情形乃復紊亂，南京代表詢問根據退條令代表退席，並表示將全體何出北方代表則堅請主席執行其所宣布之決定，僵持不下，未幾，主席台上又傳出「休會」聲，女代表張岫嵐以細故與主席發生爭議致爭吵聲，　鈴聲，議論聲四處　作，秩序亂極，一二　兵亦於門首觀望，俾作必要時維持秩序之處置。　荷係十　許起立發言，至此時鐘已指十時廿分，紛　先後已逾廿分鐘，主席乃作　急處　請在場記者及與會場無關人員退席，同時提付表決。先表決建都西安，蘭州及武漢等提案，皆僅獲七票或八票，記者等於隔室　　，僅　哄笑聲，　　決建都北平一案，一片拉凳子與皮鞋聲自會塲傳出，咸知起立贊成者必不在少數，旋聞　百閔以其浙江國語促請主席注意，該案既有相反意見，請按主席團決議，送綜合委會審查，投票結束後，記者忽忽人場　　，始知贊成建都北平者　佔多數（在場一九二人，贊成者一一七人），主建都南京者僅于六十三票，主張不在憲法中明文規定者亦僅六十七票。北方代表咸大滿意、南京代表江政卿等則至主席台鄭重聲明保留在大會發言權，職業代表何元明九時半即有一條交主席，請渠暫停審查，將該案提交綜合委會，主席未能注意，致引起軒然大波，何特向主席提出質問，並深表遺憾。十時四十五分繼續討論第二章南京代表次第離去，會場於大風波後殊見沉寂，僅若干代表以慢條斯理之語調討論「人身自由」問題，此事雖關係人民殊鉅，然已不復引起一般注意矣。</p>
<h3>政院對立院負責　第三審委會交小組整理</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十二日電〕第三審委會今晨九時舉行，蔣勻田主席，繼續討論第五十八條行政院對立法院負　之條文，分別由劉盥訓，史尚寬，杜光項，陳長衡等發表意見，並由王世杰說明自五五憲草經政協及最近之修改經過，各代表意見甚多，主席徵求大家意見，休息五分鐘後，王寵惡，王世杰。李俊龍，孫亞夫，張維　等，即提出意見，認爲可組一整理小組，先行整理，然後以整理意見付大會討論，比較簡而易行，當經通過，即進行票選七人爲整理人，下午繼續開會，整理小組定四時舉行。</p>

<h3>政府派員赴延安事目前無具體決定大連問題我決遵守條約</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京十二日電〕中宣部中外記者招待會、十二日下午二時舉行、由彭部長學沛，葉司長公超主持，茲將主要問答錄次；</p>
<p>問，政府有否重開和平談判之計劃，爲此目的，政府現有何措施，何人代表政府赴延安，張羣乎？鄧力子乎？</p>
<p>彭部長答，政府有派負前往延安之意，唯　前尙無任何具體決定。</p>
<p>問，中共已明白表示、「解散國大，恢復一月十三日軍事位置」二點，作爲恢復談判　礎，今政府宣俙有意恢復和談，且將派大員赴延安商談，請問政府是否對些一點有意考慮，或政府另有談判之基礎？</p>
<p>彭部長答，中共所提兩點，中外各報已均認爲不可能，故余不必再加許論，至其他各節，尙無決定。</p>
<p>問。東北已有大規模戰鬥吾？或不久將發生吾？或他處已發生吾？在延安邊區衝突中，究竟何方對何方有何行動？</p>
<p>彭部長答。東北及其他任何地方，均無大規模戰鬥，據報，中共在東北準備所謂冬季攻勢，並在長春東北西北一帶，集中多數裝備訓練均劣之部隊，但目前尙無舉動。延安邊區除偶有小衝突外，亦尙平靜，政府曾警吿中共勿攻榆林，以免延及延安，目前無事。中共所宣傳政府遺重　包圖邊區，亦非事實，蓋現駐各該地之部瞰，註紮其地也久矣。</p>
<p>問，中蘇是否曾談判接收大連問題？</p>
<p>葉司長答，關於大迎問題，中國政府並未與蘇方進行談判，我人看法，大連之地位，在中蘇條約中旣已明白規定，應無若何折衝之需要，中國政府富嚴格遂守並　行中蘇條約之　款。</p>
<p>問，所謂中蘇安東協定眞相如何？</p>
<p>葉司長答，在安東之中國取事當局，已　令注意，使在朝鮮邊界之蘇軍崗位，不再伸入我　國境，此事正與當地蘇軍交涉。</p>

<h3>紐約外長會議圓滿結束</h3>
<p>紐約四國外長會議已於昨日圓滿結束了。不僅完成它預定的任務，將巴黎和會所通過的對義·羅·匈·保·芬五國和約草案予以通過，並決定於來年二月十日在巴黎簽字；而且又作進一步的決議，下次四國外長會議定於明年三月十日在莫斯科舉行，討論對德奧兩國的和約草案。這不能不說是這次四國外長會議的重大成就。</p>
<p>綠在一九四六年的一年之中，各國的政治外交家爲了收拾戰後的殘局以締造世界和平，不知召開了多少次的國際會議；從本年一月間聯合國大會在倫敦舉行第一屆會議開始，接連在巴黎召開過兩次四國外長會議，始使廿一國和會得在巴黎開幕，其後聯合國大會第二屆會議又在紐約舉行，四國外長也就順便在紐約開會。在此期間，各國的政治外交家不辭勞苦，風塵僕僕往來於倫敦巴黎與紐約之間，他們心胸中唯一的憧憬，就是在如何爲世界和平奠定一個鞏固的始基。故在歷次的國際會議中，終是不惜任何唇舌，儘量陳述各人的意見，雖然迭次引起波瀾；但是戰後人類愛好和平的良知，終於克服了一切障礙，而將其所面臨的最感棘手的國際問題商得妥協辦法，使一九四六年仍能獲得一個平靜的歸趨。所以我們對於紐約四國外長會議的圓滿結束，不能不表示相當的滿意；而認此爲締造世界和平公能成功最有力的保障。</p>
<p>自從四國外長會議討論對義·羅·匈保·芬五國和約草案商有成議之後，國際上就充滿了樂觀的氣氛，展開了一幕美妙的遠景；法國政界首先表示滿意，蘇聯政論家茹科夫在「眞理報」發表論文，對於四國外長會議的成就，特別加以强調，並以樂觀的語氣說：「觀於四國外長會議的成功，可知四强道力合作，仍屬可能。」這句話實在含有非常深刻的意義，値得我們體味深思的。因爲自從第二次世界大戰結束以來，國際局勢千變萬化，一忽兒「山窮水盡」，以爲無路可走了；但又一忽兒，却「柳暗花明」，覺得前途光明，大有可爲了。信樣的明晦不定，實在使一般愛好和平的人們感覺到煩惱，尤其是希望國際和平的中國，對於國際局勢的演變，無時無刻不在密切注視之中，日夜想望國際局勢能够早日開朗。成功湖的波瀾迭起，常使我們坐立不安；但是現在人類的良知，終於突破了國際間的疑雲，聯合國大會在討論調查軍隊及裁减軍備兩大難題，本來各國意見紛歧，各人所見不同，不啻是背道而馳；但是經過各國政治外交家的折衷又折衷，妥協又妥協，中·英·美·法·蘇五强的意見，終於趨於一致，咸立了九項原則。又當四國外長在討論最感棘手的特里雅斯特港問題時，各國的利害衝突，似乎沒有妥協的餘地；但到了最後，也獲得了協議。列强代表都抱了互信互讓精神，「無事不可商量，無問題不能解決」，眞使我們對於世界和平的前途，發生無限的希望。</p>
<p>最近國際形勢的好轉，據英國自由戴曼徹斯特導報的分析：這是由於蘇聯政策有重大轉變所致；該報並呼籲西方各國政治外交家，利用此一不可多得的機會，善運知慧，與蘇聯謀得澈底的合作。本報社論，一再希望戰後世界不致分裂爲兩個世界，否則即無和平可言，最近兩星期來國際的進步，實在是一個時代轉捩的起點，一年來國際上層出不窮的逆流，從此都可以消滅於無形了。又據蘇聯眞理報載稱，蘇聯若干江業生產量的增加，仍在政府預算計劃的水準之下，由此也可以知道，蘇聯經濟的困難情形了。西方各國的政治外交家，應該放大眼光，從大處着眼，務使蘇聯恍然大悟且深信不疑：蘇聯如能與西方各國合作，則必較與其對抗爲有利。唯有如此，目前美妙的遠景，始有實現的可能。</p>
<p>最後，還有一點，我們不得不指出，就是我國對於下屆四國外長會議在莫斯科舉行，討論對德奧兩國和約草案，自然也深表贊成；惟依照波茨坦宣言，中國也是外長會議的一份子，當有權要求參加莫斯科外長會議，共同討論對德和的，英，美，法，蘇四國絕無拒絕的理由；但是美國國務卿貝爾納斯把我國王外長的要求提出之後，却遭到蘇聯外長莫洛托夫的反對，使我們不能不表示遺憾。同時我們並要向四强進一言：目下列强間的安協，如不能擴大基礎，則眼前的遠景雖極美妙，但是仍恐難以實現。故在此際，我們還不能樂觀過早呢！</p>
<h3>龐德教授論述中國憲法</h3>
<p>〔美國波士頓航訊〕世界法學權威美國哈佛大學龐德敎授，最近發表長約二萬餘言之論文，對中國今後制憲應注意之基本原則，以歷史的，比較的方法，及社會法學Sociologicae　jurisprudence的實用哲學Pragmatic　philosophy的眼光詳加論列，頗引起美國人士注意。茲述其大意如下：</p>
<p>（一）中國需要一種具有中國性格，合乎中國國情之中國憲法，不必抄襲外國</p>
<p>制定憲法時最應注意之點，乃使憲法之內容配合一國之歷史與文化背景及社會環境。立憲政治並非可於短期內專憑理想創造之物。立憲政府必須由一國人民原有之文物制度及傳統之理想中逐步形成發展，決非一種畏成後可任意由一國移諸他國之物。中華民國之創造者孫中山博土有見於此，故主張先予中國人民以過渡之期間，以便爲實行憲政而作相當之準備。一九三六年宣佈之憲法草案（編者按即五五憲草）係根據此項計劃而起草者。該項憲法草案乃根據中國之歷史文化背景及社會情形爲中國人而起草，並非爲西歐或美洲之人民或理想爲烏託邦之居民而起草。</p>
<p>法國革命前後，憲法屢經變更，一九四六年復另訂新憲。法國於十八世紀末葉十年間採行三種憲法，於十九世紀採行六種憲法，而在二十世紀之一半尙未度過之今日，復另採一新憲法，總計法國於一百五十七年間共採行十種憲法。</p>
<p>美國情形則適相反，美國聯邦成立後從未更換憲法。當南北戰爭之時，僅三度修正憲法，但政府之一般組織並未受其影響。誠如英國大政治家及思想家蒲萊斯（Bryce）所云：</p>
<p>「凡是以令人服從尊敬者，必在已往即具有一較深之根基：凡制度之產生發展愈緩者，其壽命亦大都最長；美國憲法並非例外」。</p>
<p>美國革命後之情形頗與抗戰八年後今日中國之情形相類似。當時美國經濟遭受嚴重之破壞，今日之中國亦然，昔年美國制憲，對固有制度儘量保存，故其憲法能適合國情。法國當年制憲，過受十七八世紀所流行抽象思想之影響，未能考慮本國之歷史背景及社會情形，故雖屢易憲法而政局不能穩定。中國今日制憲似不應專抄襲西洋各國之制度。</p>
<p>一種憲法之價値，未可專憑紙面上之規定而論斷之。今日有若干國家僅爲紙面上之民主國家（Demoeracies　on　paper）。中美南美若干共和國，及歐洲東南部若干新國家即其明例。此類國家制憲之道不足爲訓。在此類國家中一般人民實際上尙不知或尙無機會得知如何在政治上運用憲法所賦予若輩之參政權。</p>
<p>有人以爲可就歐美各國今昔之憲法，加以之精密研究可發見一種可普遍適用於世界各國之理想憲法。此種見解之錯誤，實與迷信可以制定一種可普遍適用於世界各國之理想民刑法典相等。人類之經騐實與之相反。</p>
<p>憲法之制定須顧及時間，區域，及人民三者之需要，中國所需要者乃一種具有中國性格</p>
<p>適合中國情形之憲法，非抄襲外國之憲法。一九二六年之憲草對於此點曾予以注意，較屬可馭。英國學者浦萊斯營云：「所關緊要者，乃事實，非名稱」。任何人對於中國環境不能如中國人自己認識之眞切，惟有中國人自己能運用其才智，爲中國制定一種能持久之憲法。余對於今日中國爲公衆服務之人觀察良多。余之觀察已足以使余信任其能力，誠摯及智慧。故余敢以爽真之語氣對彼等曰：「諸君應信任自己，諸君應根據自已之見解壓識推行當前之任務。」</p>
<p>（二）三權制並非民主或立憲政治之必要條件。</p>
<p>三權制原爲希臘學者亞理斯多德所創之理論。在當時並無事實之根據，蓋希臘當時尙無所謂分權。</p>
<p>英國在十七世紀時雖逐漸分權，但並未達到法儒孟德斯鳩所述之程度。實際上在英國所有權力均集中於國會，距三權制頗遠。美國實行分權制，曾遭遇種種之困難，蓋政治與法律皆爲實際事務，未可全憑邏輯以劃分一國之政治權力。</p>
<p>三權制並非立憲或民主政治所必具之條件。一般人認爲此種制度係可以普遍適用於世界各國之理想制度，未免忽視此種制度所由產生之特殊的歷史與社會背景。蓋無人能主張三權制乃唯一保障自由，宜於立憲政治，或符合民主理想之制度。</p>
<p>民主有名義上之民主與實質上之民主。世界上名義上之民主不乏其例。吾人應一努力於實質民主之實現，不必拘泥於名稱。民主之方式各有不同，故其權力止之分配，亦未可一概而論。</p>
<p>君主有專制與立憲之分，民主亦有專制與立憲之分，在人民知識水準低落及政治訓練不足之國家，多數人之意見未必可取，且大衆未必均能熱心國事，結果多數人之民主政治，無非少數官僚政客之專制政治。况憲法之規定能限制官吏，未必能限制一國主權所在之全體成多數人民。如人民敎育程度不足，憲法所預期之目的未必能實現。</p>
<p>現代國家已由以行使統治權爲目的之權力國家轉變爲以服務人民爲目的之「服務國家」（Service－State）。行政活動之範圍日漸推廣，其重要性亦日漸增加，故行政權不應過受限制。</p>
<p>今日中國行政上所迫切需要者乃統一性，繼續性，穩定性與效能之提高。中國既缺乏美國當年之歷史及社會背景，並無採三欄制之必要，且三權制對於今日中國政治上之迫切需要亦未必適合。</p>
<p>（三）中國究應採責任內閣制總統制抑其他制度：</p>
<p>憲法討論者往往認爲近代國家不採責任內閣制，即須採總統制，實則民主國家之政府組織，並無絕對仿照二者中任何一者之必要，十九世紀中最靈頭角之民主國家，當推英美二國，其制當爲其他多數國家所採，但英國之責任內閣制流行雖廣，其在他國實行之成績群雖令人滿意，蓋此制之優點依若十人士之意見爲：（一）能使人民意思迅速的究全發生作用，（二）能使行政部門與立法機關之多數分子合作而發揮政府之效能，（三）能使責任集中。而其弊則爲：（甲）易使黨派之偏激精神發揮至於極端，並使黨派觀念時時主宰一切；（乙）像丙閣過分注意如何遷就當時民衆之幻想，以博得其擁護，而對謚國家之眞正需要，過於忽視），（丙）因關於特定事件內閣在國會中之失敗連續迫使政府所需要之人員，脫離行政職務，（丁）權力之集中，於國會及重要決策之須迅速定奪及實行，使主其事者無深思熟慮之機會。誠如蒲萊斯在其名著「近代民主政府」一書中所云「其錯誤無法補救者。」</p>
<p>况主張內閣制之優點者，往往假定人民之意思係易於捉摸者，人民在特定時間之意思係固定者。在疆城甚小。文化純粹。教育一律，消息靈通組織緊凑之國家此種情形或係事實。惟在最近將來之中國，此種假定恐難成事實。</p>
<p>美國之總統制，流行於南美若干共和國，此制產於美國革命以後，其且的重在維持國家之安全秩序。其利爲：（一）國家之政策可不因內閣驟然失敗而中止執行。使行政較富於繼續性；（二）總統與內閣可不必爲反對言論及倒閣活動而分心，能致力於工作，（三）立法工作受黨派鬥爭觀念支配之程度較淺，蓋各種事件之處理可不至牽及黨派間力量之比較；（四）因各方在政治上所佔之勢力僅可於規定時期調整之，政治較爲穩定。</p>
<p>總統制優點之重要性如何，美史乘已一再予以證明，當林肯總統因一八六二年國會選舉而對於國會失却控制能力時，彼尙能繼續從事南北戰爭，此在責任內閣制之下，當爲不可能之事倘在一八六三年行政部門忽遭改組則美國將不堪設想。</p>
<p>總統制在美國相當成功，但在其他國家則成效未著。其不能任意移植，正與英國之責任內閣制同。</p>
<p>除上述二制外，尙有古代及瑞士若干州之直接民權制，瑞士聯邦之行政委員會制及俄國之逐層議會制。前二者。不宜於中國之環境，無待贅言；至俄國之制度，係由俄國之特殊歷史及文化背景中發展而成，其利弊若何，尙難斷言。</p>
<p>中國憲法起草者，鑒於中國情形之不同，未拘泥於任何制度而酌採各制之某部分，以適合國情，珠屬可嘉。</p>
<p>（四）中國應採單一政體，其中央與地方職權之劃分，宜採概括規定，而不宜詳細列舉。</p>
<p>就各國之歷史言之。疆域廣大之國家，雖不宜將權力集中於中央政府，然多外患之國家其疆域雖大，亦不能不採單一政體。聯邦政體大都爲歷史之產物，殊不足以充實國防抵抗强隣之侵略。當國家有外患之可能時，寗犧牲聯邦制而建立强有力之中央政權。</p>
<p>美國加拿大英屬澳洲殖民地，及南菲洲共和國向無嚴重之外患，敌無建立强有力之國防制度之必要。其採行聯邦制似無不可，中國今日之處境不同，制憲者應顧及國防之需要，故單一政體較爲可取。</p>
<p>至中央與地方職權之分配，應以維持均衡爲主旨、即專權之有關全國一般性者，應嚴於中央，其與地方關係較切或具有地方特殊性者，應屬於地方。惟二者之界限，未便嚴格規定。蓋二者在任何時期，均不容絕對的劃分淸是。所謂全國性與地方性並無普遍之標準。前代所認爲具有地方性者，今日每認爲具有全國性。（下文轉入第三版）</p>

<h3>吳興兩億餘鉅騙案　大綢荘以香餌歛錢後倒閉　債主多爲高利貸下自害者</h3>
<p>〔本報吳興訊〕本縣自勝利後，幣債低落，物價日漲，財政既失平衡，經濟陷於絕境，平民生活，備受威脅，社會人心，日趨險詐，奸盜詐僞等事，常有發生。茲有本城新荘街振康綢荘，在上海、蘇州等處，均有分荘設立，規模甚大，範圍亦廣，湖荘對中國交通二銀行進出款項，由柴宗獄爲負責人，對其他業務進出，由王仲甫爲負責人，申荘張季臣爲經理，蘇荘徐松生爲經理，平日營業除綢縐外，兼做拆洋，（吳興最盛行高利貸，每百元每十日利息至少十元，但須借時先行扣除，）濫發空頭支票，雇用職員，向本城與上海蘇州有往來之商店，重價貼現，初時如期解根，是以不失信用，一般貪利商民無不樂爲往來，詎至十二月六日止，申蘇湖三荘同時倒閉，負責經理人員亦均隱匿不見，受害債權，群起恐慌，經記者調查所得，合計受騙之款，竟達二萬萬四千三百萬元之詎，尙有本城東街春源醫園，爲振康綢荘向湖州中國銀行擔保一千萬元借款，至亦受累，因無力賠償，已請王德　律師宣告清理，如拆洋風氣再蔓延不禁，則吳興整個商業前途，將不堪設想。</p>

<h3>龐德教育論述中國憲法　上文接第二版</h3>
<p>美國當年制憲幸未對於規定政府職權時所用之名詞於條文中詳加解釋。故以後尙能以巧妙之解釋，擴張中央政府之職權，以適應新時代之需要。美國中央與地方職權劃分之界限，常在移動中，並非固定不變者，而其趨勢則爲全國性事權之擴張，即中央權力之加強。吾人如以今日之情形與四十年前相較，當知以前許多地方性之事權，已因環境之變遷，事實之需要，及法院之解釋而成爲全國性之事權。美國憲法當年對於此點，僅規定大綱而將詳細之點留待日後解決，藉收因時因地制宜之效，實計之得者。</p>
<p>中國憲法起草者，採中央與地方均權制，殊屬妥適。其對於均權制度僅設一般原則而不作詳細之具體規定，使立法機關將來得因時因地而立法，憲法之解釋機關得因時因地而爲解釋，與美國行憲之經驗若合符節，可謂善取他人之長也矣。</p>
<p>（五）人民權利之保障</p>
<p>十七世紀以來，個人主義者及自然法學派，嘗目權利爲神聖不可侵犯之物，近今學者則有否認權利之存在者。二者皆失之偏激，均不足取，蓋前者過重個人之利益，後者則過重一般之秩序，在今日以服務爲目的之國家中，二者應互相調和，維持均衡。</p>
<p>個人之權利與政府之職權，應如何劃分其界限，因時因地而不同，故歷史所昭示於吾人者，殊不一致。對於人民權利之規定，實非易事。</p>
<p>中國憲草，關於此點之規定，大體妥適，惟個人對於遠憲之法律，能否如美國人民向法院請求救濟，未有明確之規定。如就憲草第九條第三款，第二十六條等作綜合之觀察，立法機關茍違反第二十五條之規定；人民似無權向法院請求救濟。</p>
<p>中國應否採行美制，許個人對於違憲之法律，有請求救濟之權，須視中國之環境而定。</p>
<p>美制可溯源於中世紀，其目的在防止國會之專橫，美國人民雖嘗表示不滿，然直至現在聯邦及各州仍採行之。此制之推行，有賴於健全法院，其法官除具備法律知識外，尙須明瞭一般政治經濟，及社會情形。中國是否宜於採行此制，似值得考慮。</p>
<p>（六）五權之分配</p>
<p>中國憲草最顯著之特點，乃政府職權之五分法，余認爲「權之分立」（Separation　of　powers）不如「權之分配」（Distribution　of　powers）之妥適，蓋前者含有彼此對抗之意味，後者則否。</p>
<p>前已言之，三權制或二權，並非立憲或民主國家必採之制度，故五權制未必不宜於立憲或民主國家。</p>
<p>五權制下政府之各部門，地位平等，無此高於彼之情形。法國與美國，因政府某部門之地位超越其他，常至彼此不協調，破壞政治上之一致性與繼續性。中國憲法第四十五條規定：「總統得召集五院院長會商關於二院以上事項及總統咨詢事項」足以防止法美等國可能發生之摩擦，而提高政治效能。</p>
<p>或以爲中國之三部門另設二部門，將有增加摩擦或紛歧之可能，殊不知第四十五條已足以防止或減少此種可能。況在中國歷史上，此種制度確有相當根據，當能適合國情而發生良果。</p>
<p>憲草中之立法院，與英國國會不同，其權力有相當限制。行政院亦與法國之行政部門不同，其職權之行使，須受司法院等之控制。行政院譯爲英文有稱「執行院」（Execotive　yuan）者，含義似嫌過狹，似可改譯爲A　ministrative　yuan（即行政院之意）。</p>
<p>考試院乃中國之特別制度，其優點頗多。此實爲確保文官之任免脫離政黨政治之良法。英國因政黨之活躍，關於公務員之任用，嘗發生所謂「分配戰利品」之制度（Spoils　system），即政治上得勝者，可將政府職位作爲戰利品分配與其黨人或擁護者。考試院之制度，可免此弊。考試權之保障，亦頗值得注意。</p>
<p>監察院亦爲中國固有而適合現代需要之特別制度。人人得過問之事，往往無人過問。官吏腐敗，在西洋國家每易逍遙法外，或者以爲選舉制裁官吏之失職行動。雖往往以事隔過久，該項行動早爲一般民眾所忘卻。外國立法機關之委員會，行政官吏，及檢察人員權限不明，責任不專，其檢舉官吏之成績，亦難令人滿意。國會之彈劾權，在美國則爲一般人所厭惡。如中國監察院之立於超然地位而能專其職司者，在西洋殆不多觀。此種制度並非專橫抽象之理想而產生者，在中國有其悠久之歷史背景，常能有偉大之貢獻。</p>
<p>或問行政院應否改爲「責任內閣」受立法院之控制，使立法院成爲英國之國會而兼管立法以外之職務。余意此種規定將使立法院不能致力於立法工作，立法機關而不能重視立法，實爲一大錯誤。</p>
<p>或問行政院應否對總統負責。余以爲不可。蓋如是則總統將失其超然地位。</p>
<p>司法院乃最高之司法機關，其所處之地位頗似英國之貴族院，據余想象，將來當由法學家與政治家合組之。若然，則賦予解釋憲法之職權，可望勝任愉快。</p>
<p>中國憲草中，尙有一值得注意之點，即監察院有權將憲法問題向司法院提諸解釋。依此項規定之理論，法律之違憲似爲立法機關之失職行爲，應受監察院之制裁。</p>
<p>（七）國民大會</p>
<p>國民大會雖有二千餘人之代表，較諸美國各大政黨之全國會議（到會者超過一千人），尙不可謂爲過於龐大。倘能得適當人才參與其事，並對於開會之儀式及程序等有明確合理之規定，當不至淪爲不負責任之民眾機關。</p>
<p>或問國民大會內應否另設一小規模之黨設代表機構。余以爲此種制度易使少數人淪爲獨裁者，憲草對於國民大會之召集，既有多方面之規定，實無需採此制度。國民大會設立之目的，在使其過問國家之大事，政府之一般事項，實無由其管理之必要也。（完）</p>

<h3>賴伽第亞提辭程　聯總工作由羅克斯負責　理事會中東西集團意見參商</h3>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓十一日電〕今日自權威方面探悉，賴伽第亞於十二月三十一日正式退職後，聯總之清理工作，將由副署長維克斯少將負責。羅氏在北菲戰中隸屬艾森豪威爾將軍麾下，歐戰結束後，復監督德軍統帥部之淸理。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓十一日電〕聯總署長賴伽第亞本日正式向聯總行政會議提出辭呈，並謂本人辭職將於去年十二月卅一日聯總結束時開始，但希望在第六屆行政會議舉行期間，任命一繼任人。衆信賴伽第亞署長之繼任人選可望於明日決定。</p>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓十一日電〕聯總理事會在此計論是否應繼續聯總工作時，東西集團又起衝突。蘇聯代表費沃諾夫聲明聯總工作尙未結束，根據最近發表之數字觀之，尙有價値七億五千萬元之物品待運歐洲各國。渠建議於明年四月，再召開理事會會議，美代表伍特及英代表梅景斯立即表示反對，並否認蘇聯所稱美國撕毀前此諾言，企圖停供歐洲應獲救濟物資之說。項協定爲「非法」。印代表力言渠不能贊同徒換名稱之殖民主義，此種主義爲印度輿情所遺責。各殖民國家代表力言彼等決心不將託管領土合併，但反對託管協定每隔十年修訂一次之計劃。</p>
<h3>三十四國簽定麻醉品議定書</h3>

<h3>南國與阿爾巴尼亞　締結關稅同盟　組巴爾幹斯拉夫聯邦之先聲</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦十一日電〕南斯拉夫與阿爾巴尼亞，已訂立關稅同盟協定，其範圍之廣大，等於兩國經濟之合併。此間觀察家相信，此舉乃組織巴爾幹斯拉夫聯邦之第一步。就歷史上觀，尤其在十九世紀時代，關稅同盟之締結，往往爲政治統一之先聲。第一次大戰後，法國即會基於此項恐懼，以反對德奧締結關稅同盟，惟迄至目前爲此，南阿之關稅同盟似尙無擴大及於保國之表示。</p>

<h3>中國與印度（下）（尼赫魯著）</h3>
<p>— 本報駐印記者　周祥光譯</p>
<p>好多古時所印書籍，在中國發現，約在公元第八世紀間，這些書都是用梵文寫的。而這些書籍都刻印於木版中。當公元第十世紀，中國之皇室印書局成立，以迄宋代，其印刷技術發展至速。當此之時，中印兩國學者交往，仍然密切，如彼輩交換書籍及經典，前後數百年，故印度在此時，自有印刷術，惟無充份證據存在，估計當時情形，不免艱難。昔時中國活版印刷術即傳至西藏，今日我相信西藏之活版印刷依然如昔。中國印刷術傳至歐洲，係當元代（公歷一二六〇－一三六八）先傳至德國，至十五世紀時，傳遍歐洲各國矣。</p>
<p>當印度在印度阿富汗及莫臥兒王朝時代，中印兩國時有外交的來往。如在公元一三二六—五一間，德里蘇丹默罕默德冰突拉曾派阿拉伯之著名旅行者伊伯甫德爲駐中國朝廷之使節。當此之時，孟加拉脫離德里蘇丹之保護，而成爲獨立之回敎王國領土。在公元第十四世紀中葉，中國朝廷曾遺外交使節胡興及斐興二人，駐在孟加拉蘇丹朝廷中。這使孟加拉在琪斯阿定蘇丹統治時，能完成派遺使節到中國。道正在中國的明朝時代。孟加拉最後的一次遺使到中國，是在一四一四年之賽阿定皇帝時代，幷携去賓貴禮物，在這些禮物中，尙有活的麒麟一頭。這麒麟如何能運到印度，則頗驚奇；或許這頭麒麟是從阿非利加送來之禮物，幷且貢獻明皇常作珍奇禮物，而得明皇之賞贊。誠然，道麒麟到中國後，自受他們極大欣賞，幷且孔子之徒，認麒麟爲祥瑞之兆。這是毫無疑問的，麒麟這動物，在中國有長久之傳說，幷且中國在絲織品上，繡有麒麟。中國朝廷中之藝衛家，對於這種畫之畫成，都有很長的詞句說明如何欣賞之情，及佳運從此面得。朝廷官員及人民咸注視此物而欣賞無窮。</p>
<p>中印兩國貿易方面，在佛敎時代，己經開展，更經印度阿當汗及莫臥兒王朝面發達，幷且繼續交換商品。其航路從陸上跨北喜馬拉雅山而過及沿舊時中亞細亞之駱駝商隊所走之原路。然另有海上貿易之路，即經東南亞各島嶼，主要的是到南印度各港口。</p>
<p>中印兩國這千餘年以上的交往，彼此都能得到一些事物之瞭解，不但在思想哲學方面爲然，而且在文字及生活科學上亦屬如此。或許中國所受印度之影響較印度所受中國之影響爲深，不過印度亦能善於吸收外來文化，所可遺憾者，印度未曾得到中國文化之精髓，倘若得之，則印度亦能以其所得者，而停止其無謂之空想。雖然，中國自印度方面取得極多之文化藝學，惟她依然獨立强盛，並且在她自己發展的路上，仍舊取用不盡，並且有些地方，適應她自己之生活組織。甚至佛敎及其高深哲學與中國孔老之學，亦能相合。但我們看到佛敎哲學總含有些許之悲觀主義，未能更變，甚或有得於生活上的愛與夫中國人的樂觀思想。中國古時有句格言說：「倘你被衙門所執，你將鞭笞而死；而被佛陀所縛，則必飢餓而死」。</p>
<p>公元第十六世紀時，中國有一部最著名的小說，便是吳淸瀛所著的西遊記，其中描寫着玄奘到印，在途中所經歷之種種神奇怪事。此書曾獻至印度：「我將此書奉獻於佛陀之凈土，願以此書報答師恩，願以此書消除罪惡……」。</p>
<p>在中國兩國失去交往後的數世紀之內，彼此都受着英國東印度公司所給予之意外的遭遇。印度已受着長期的遭遇，中國雖屬爲時甚短，但亦發生了鴉片戰爭。</p>
<p>現在命運之輪，已在整個旋轉，中印兩國展望前程，與回視過去，未來的朝山進香的新旅客，他們將各自跨越大陸或飛渡高峯，携着他們的歡愉與友情的使命，奠定了親密友誼的基礎。</p>
<h3>德境蘇軍有撤退模樣　間諜人員大肆活動　蘇方仍圖保持政治控制</h3>
<p>〔聯合社柏林十一日電」蘇聯間宣傳又以新方法在德國大肆活動，美國謀報人員頗信此說間諜與反問諜，在四國佔領下之柏林市內本係習見，有時不免滑稽。據向美方登記之柏林某報載稱，蘇聯間諜之新活動，乃因預料德國佔領區，行將破除界域，使全國成爲一個經濟單位，西方國家佔領區與蘇聯佔領區可以自由通商。一旦此事見之實行，「鐵幕」旣揭，則蘇聯方面必須設法保持其在政治上之控制，在佔領區內之德人，勿受西方「傳染」。因此利用共產黨控制下之統一社會黨黨員，由軍政府與以援助，使其在蘇聯佔領區內選舉勝利。據英國控制下之德國新聞社消息，蘇聯佔領區之統一社會黨曾奉到下列命令稱，佔領區界限撤銷後，統一社會黨黨員必須從事戒備，注意人民接見由西方國家佔領區前來訪問之人，即在目前各區領袖亦須一律報吿。某消息靈通之德國新聞從業員與蘇聯方面有密切關係，常往其佔領區內旅行，據稱，統一社會黨之口號爲「人人皆是間諜」，蘇聯利用區城領袖制，凡屬忠實黨員，皆應負責令其本區內之每一個居民保持「政治的純潔」。此項制度於西方盟國共同佔領柏林時即已實施，後因美國堅持反對而撤銷。</p>
<p>〔聯合社德國海姆史丹特十二日電〕蘇軍配備似正大規模由英軍佔領區附近之馬其保向東撤退回國。越過柏林之公路上，可見大隊運貨卡軍取道特萊斯登面至東歐。此項行動，似爲蘇聯佔領軍復員運動之一部，惟軍隊並不多見，殆係乘坐火車回國。沿途軍用卡車，絡繹不絕，裝載或拖帶較小牛車，顯係蘇方大規模向東調動。</p>
<h3>開浚水道便利搬運</h3>
<p>〔聯合社柏林十一日電〕蘇聯在德境佔領區內現正令數千德人進行開濬奧特河計劃，擴張其「安全水道」，以運輸賠償物資至蘇聯。此水道與史丹丁港聯絡，通過波羅的海而至列寧格勒，係因經由波蘭之鐵路常有匪患，且波蘭自身運輸問題正多，自奧特尼西界綫以東之德人方被驅逐出境，致蘇聯不能盡量利用波蘭鐵路。關於開港奧特河計劃，蘇聯當局秘不宣布，但據新近由蘇佔領區回來之德國新聞記者稱，河中充滿紅星船雙，均係沒收之德商船，現正忙於裝運德賠償物資，如製成之工廠出品，及拆卸之機器設備等。</p>

<h3>法蘇同盟二週年　巴黎一片親蘇言論</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎十一日電〕法蘇稀維同盟與互助條約，迄今已屆二周年，法官方人士對於法蘇兩國密切友誼，稱道礦至，咸認爲此類友誼，乃法國將來之政治資本。並謂，法蘇兩國在簽訂互助條約之後，即開始保持密切友誼，此項條約之目的，原在防止德國再度發動侵略，但法蘇兩國在起草對義羅匃保芬五國和約時，常採取同　一方針，足證兩國互助條約，實具有永久之重要性。蘇聯不僅在政治上曾協助法國，抑且在道義上及物質上，亦曾依照條約之精神援助法國，例如法國今春糧食匱乏，蘇聯國內雖亦感困難，但仍以大麥及小麥接濟法國。</p>

<h3>中國名鹿留種英國</h3>
<p>角兒向後直指鹿尾</p>
<p>〔英國新聞處倫敦十二日電〕一八六五年某一法國敎士在北平皇園獲得一西半球從未得見之鹿皮。此鹿現稱爲台維德種鹿，足扁闊，鹿角直指鹿尾，每年換角二次。十九世紀末葉，英國白特福德公爵曾設法以此種鹿移養於英國，此舉得使此種鹿免於滅種，蓋在一九〇〇年北平皇園洪水泛濫，該園之鹿全部死亡。目下英國所義之鹿，乃世界上之僅存者。</p>

<h3>籌備調查壯丁身家　訂定三項進行程序　送參議會核准後即公布</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據民政處處長張曉崧語記者稱；本市徽兵問題，近今猶未獲得任何明令。自上次市政會議決定兵役部分由民政處辦理後，該處之第一步準備工作，如爲調查本市壯丁，作精確之統計。現該處已依照國防部卅五年度壯身家調查實施施辦法之規定，並適應本市實際情形，擬訂上海市政府卅五年度壯丁調查實施解決。其中規定調查壯丁由區公所負鱧　辦理，其調查程序如下：（一）講習：以各區參加之壯丁調查人員爲對象，由區公所主辦。講習科目爲修正兵役法，戶籍法，出征軍人家庭優待條例，妨害兵治罰條例等。（二）調查實施：本年度役齡計算，應自民國十六年隊起（十九歲虛齡）至民前十一年隊止（四十五歲），調查時應詢明出生之年月，同時告以幾肖（如乙丑年出生者屬牛）。凡係役齡壯丁，無論本縣家籍，均於現住地造冊，如有工作地點與住宿地點不同在一地時，應詢明本人原列何處管區名開內，以免軍復，檢果漏丁。各戶長甲長保長須出具無漏丁切結，出區備文呈府備查，各保則召開保民大會，報告調查經過，並公開檢舉漏丁及遵法失職人員。上項調查眾務，係分屬負責，各級人員辦理成績卓越過劣者，由府報當國防部分別獎懲，機關，國體，學校，工廠如有氣絕調查，或有包茲壯丁情事，報講國防部整理。上述辦法，已送參議會，核准後即行公布施行。</p>
<h3>各業「年賞」　觀察一般情形，問題不致嚴重　加強勞工紀律仍賴雙方合作</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據有資格人士觀察：今年之年賞問一月爲限，且需全视盈余而定。另一方面暗示有盈餘之廠家，自動將年賞酌予提高，以滿足勞方之要求。同時加強工人之組織，使別有用心者，無充分擾亂之機會。事實上，此項組織工作已有相當成效，最大之證明爲在攤販事件中，工廠工人並未有人參加。至於加經勞工之紀律問題，開有關人員均認爲且前紀律之廢弛，爲抗戰期內缺乏適當管理之結束，現要求於工人者，一爲守法律守秩序，二爲逐漸恢復戰前之生產標准。爲求達到以上之目標，當局今後將加強工會理監視之訓練工作，使工人領袖能具有目覺心及責任感，能領導工人走上過法之途。第二步將健全「工廠會議」，使勞資兩方代表能相聚一堂，溝通意見，而避免誤會之發生。目前工廠會議從有其名，未收實效者，資方之認識不足，勞方之觀念不正確，均應負相當責任。同時勞工主管機關將在實際工作上，顧及勞工之福利，爲其解除痛苦，以取得工人之信任，而使勞動者無法施其技倆。至於消極之壓制政策，最不足恃，權威方面無意採用。</p>

<h3>新稅率減低頗鉅　影響本市收入年達七百億元　財局呈請修改尚未獲覆</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕關於筵席捐，娛樂捐，使用牌照捐，與房捐等條例，最近立法院已予修正，並經國府於本月四日公佈，稅率之減低頗鉅，影響本市財政極大。聞本市政府當局會數度電請中央加以更改，於修正之新條例中加以「地方情形特殊者，可以請當地參議會通過後，酌量提高唯以不超過一倍爲限度。」然上項請求未獲中央答覆時，稅收之新條例已經國府公佈，則本市自當即日遵辦。然市政府當局，聽於本市經濟情形，極爲困難，故最近又電請中央，請其將新條例退回立法院，再予修正，於尚未提高國防最高委員會決議時，請准於暫時維持現行稅率及辦法。</p>
<p>記者昨日曾走訪財局負責人，詢以新稅率對本市之財政收入影響若何，據答：新稅率與現行稅率之差別甚巨，約爲減低百分之六十五。若依照新訂條例，則本市之稅收每月約須減少六十億，每年減少七百億，市府每年之收入僅爲一千三百億，較明年度預算五千億計，尚差古千七百億矣</p>
<h3>公務員簽名運動　促實行調整待遇　並請撥發寒衣費</h3>

<h3>棚戶保處多　首推長寗區</h3>
<p>拆除應先完善處理</p>
<p>自市府議決取締棚戶以來，現除已於前日起嚴禁再建棚戶外，並實施棚戶之調查。棚戶最多之區域長寗區，昨經參議會清查完竣，共計有四千八百七十七戶，其中第址八保全部均爲棚戶，其他五，七，八，十，十三，十六，二十，二十一，二十二，二十六，二十八等保，亦均有不少棚戶。如若拆除，必當請市府先行設法作完善之處理云。</p>
<h3>靑年館主　四屆參觀遊覽團</h3>

<h3>秋季捐房　仍照原辦法</h3>
<p>昨據財政局負責人表示：修正房捐條例，雖經國府於本月四日公佈，然刻市府方面尚未接到正式命令，故本市秋季房捐及市政建設捐，仍將照原定辦法征收。現在所收之捐係秋季之捐稅，早在國府分佈修正房捐條例之前，自不受其影響，且市政府建設捐與房捐係兩種捐，各有根據，修正市政府房捐條例，並非修正市政建設捐，自係兩事也。</p>
<h3>本市臨近若干區　呈請劃歸上海市</h3>
<p>關於上海市與江蘇省　界問題，前經擬具計劃，此基計劃刻正呈由內政部審核中。茲據深悉，本市臨近若乾區，會分別呈請市府及參議會，爲適合建設大上海之需要，要求將各編訂區盡歸上海市轄管，如十六區之華莊區區民代表張守先等八人，及該區各商號，近曾聯名請求將該區歸副市府，其所具理由有云：「鑒於市府不棄僻陋，慨然着手整編保甲，組織地方自治極構，推進教育，然後成立莘莊，春申，張育班，舉辦衛生工作，保障人民健康，協助興辦議務警察，促進地方聯防。凡此種種。市府均次第實施，是則名義上雖未接收，而事實上早已確立」云云。</p>
<h3>外僑土地登記遭受阻力　領館故意爲難　圖保持辦理權　堅不願受截止期限約束</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市外僑土地登記自開辦以來，無國籍僑民登記記者甚踴躍；惟有國籍僑民前往登記者甚少。以期限面論，前者限年底截止，後者則各該國領事館認爲在平等之約束，以致外僑地產登記之進行，遭受不俄，已多方予以便利與優待。例如我國政府地產登記，照例亦順收登記費。但外僑地產之登記，經主管機關向中央請示後，竟得免費辦理，實已爲過份之優待。但各國事館尚不知足，故意爲難，一爲過去優越感之作祟，二爲意欲保待過去租界時代領事館辦理土地亡命之權。在不平等地租界內，且有運用此項權力，以極低之代價，強迫國人出實地產者。今租界既已收回，此種妨礙我國主權之特權，決不能允許甚繼續存在。又據問要求由領事館代國土地登記者，以英法兩國最爲堅決，美國之態度則不甚積極云。</p>
<h3>建議撤銷　燃料統制　政院覆參議會　目前尚非其時　國際工業展覽會亦應緩辦</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕市舉議會以王舉議員正延，前會在大會建設撤銷燃統制一案，特由潘議長公展及徐副議長寄　代轉市政府請行政院核辦。現該會已得行政院轉市府制電，難以照辦，電稱「查瀘市公用車業及助力均用煙煤，市民炊專多用白煤　，此項烯料經上海區燃料管理委員係採取集中管理扶助各破，增加生產，並擴充運檢能力等有效措施後，自本年三月起其市價已相當穩定，且供應充裕，並無煤荒現象。所稱煤荒之恐慌，殆係指富有家庭中取暖之白煤塊而盡，此項白煤塊之漲價，對於公用事業動力以及炊事，均無影響，且此項白煤塊商民原可自由運銷，並不在政府管制之列，惟其可以自由運銷，本予管制，當以隆冬將至，富有家庭競事囤購，商人逐得乘機操縱，以致造成缺貨恐慌之現象。該會以煤商採運白煤埠力最有限，未能大量應市，特多方設法採購，並擬先就新近運到白煤，按廠價出售，以裕供應，藉平黑市。目前分朽煤芹，依合理辦法，故所請尚非其時。」</p>
<p>又市參議會第一次大會決議建議經濟部於明年九月三日在滬舉行國際工業展覽會，行政院亦以茲事規模宏大，須先在工業建設上有健全　　後，始克以觀備，且戰後國家復員工作，尚未完成，屆時恐不及舉辦，應予從棧。</p>

<h3>恢復戰前監工制　商定上下費標准</h3>
<p>本市港埠竊風之織，公司客商均慮應付爲難，而此和扒竊當徒多半係與碼頭貨運小工串通，故各論埠公司，爲運免客商損失，　　持借用會簽具意見，由關船業公會，轉運義務處委員會。治商之後，決予恢復戰前廠工制度，准由各築船公司自由廠工人，並派定監工人員，負責屬運裝卸等工作。現此項監工制度，已有大連。大通聯警等首先實行，並登報公告負責監工人員之姓名與職業範圍。同時港務委員會爲翻一港埠上下費率，會聯合有關各方，組織上下費事審核委員會，商定合理之費率。惟在決定上下費率之前，應以管制工作爲先決條伯，對每件貨物，工價之標準，應依碼頭工人每月實際工資若干分，以每月所獲得之工作日數爲每月工資，再除以工人每日平均　運貨物件數，即爲每件貨物之工價。此外，別加若干成，分別作爲監工費及公司管理費，公司利潤，即報之標准上下費率，上案已由港務委員會報請社會局研究中。</p>

<h3>美軍法庭上　歐哈德證言　高島曾請德方　繼續與日合作　否認知悉局員爲日活動事</h3>

<h3>國產片需要扶助　資金器材缺乏　影人生活清苦</h3>
<p>〔本報特寫〕我們搞電影的，當然得加緊努力，使國產片覺地改善，產量增加。但同時也希望各界人仕，能夠扶助本國電影，渡過目前的難關。中國電影是有前途的，可是首先得渡過這一難關。中電廠長徐蘇禮和記者暢談今日國產電影情況之後，下了目標一個結論。</p>
<p>現在拍一部影片，材料，「戰用」，布景，酬勞，和一部份經常費，約需至二萬五千萬元。出於市場低落，物價高昂，南洋橋區受限制，往往頭二三輪演下來的收入，還不敷成本。目前的國產片生意，以上海和南京兩地最好。</p>
<p>最近在本埠上演的幾張國產新片：「史義之家」，「梵飛人間」，「聖城記」，「蓮花翻白燕子飛」和「鐵骨冰心」，以「忠義之家」　座最好，在「大光明」連演一個月零二天，首輪的收入，就已經夠本。主要還是因爲，它是勝利後首次上演的國產新片。</p>
<p>目前，國產影片艱難在設備較好的影視上演。一方面因爲那些戰院，在經濟上和美國制片公司有關係，當然優先放映美片；另一方面，因爲國產片的出品少，質較差，所以也就不易爭取視院。但是，也有一些熱心的影院，喜歡放映國產片。</p>
<p>生產遲緩原因</p>
<p>至於國產片產遲緩的原因：（一）資本不足，因爲成本奇高，營臻低落，所以週轉不靈。（二）器材太差，一時又驗證以改善（三）人才不夠。</p>
<p>說到電影從業人員的生活，也都相當清苦，普通人們以爲電影明星，一定過奢華舒適的生活，但在中國，並不如此。</p>
<p>現在電影賞的酬勞，多以部頭戰計算，很少簽訂長期合同。這是因爲物價不斷上漲，簽訂合同不免吃虧。而且電影公司，也支負不起鉅額薪金。目前名演員主演一部影片的酬勞，約爲法幣一千萬元，不過一年也只能拍二三中片子　了。至於配角、酬劳是按日计算的，每天約有二万至五万元。那些临时演员们，就更苦了，每天所獲，不過八午元至一萬地而已。</p>
<p>導演一部影片的代價，自四百萬元至一千萬元。編一個電影劇本的報酬，約爲二三百萬元。影片的業務，現在毫無問題。普通拍一部影片，大約消耗二萬呎至三萬呎膠片。影片的實際長度約爲萬呎左右。至於場地設備和機器，都太落後了。</p>
<p>新片陸績完成</p>
<p>最後，談一談各制片公司的節止。中電二廠，已上演了兩部片子：「忠義之家」和「鶯飛人間」。陳聖庭導的「遠處的愛」也已經拍好了，現在正在剪接中，大約在陽歷新年時，可以上演。正在拍練或即將拍攝的，有趙丹導演談瑛主演的「衣錦榮關」。湯曉丹導澩，路明主演的「天堂春夢」。吳水關導演，金　主演的「迎春曲」。計劃攝制的，有馬除維導演的　　「天罪地綱」。和方沛導演的「八仙外傳」。</p>
<p>中電一廠，過去專拍新聞紀錄片，和負責洗印工作。最近準備攝製「還鄉日記」，張竣祥導演，白晶主演。</p>
<p>費穆主持的「上海電影實驗工廠」，一直在默默地工作著。「錢骨冰心」已經上演，還有一部「錦繡河山」不久也可和觀從見面了。</p>
<p>至於聯眾製片廠中，合眾影片公司計劃拍攝沈從文的「邊城」。由業甄指導。鳳凰影片公司，也在那裡拍攝「八千裡云和月」與「一江春水向東流」。聯眾的場址，在上海是最大的了。</p>
<p>柳中浩主持的國泰影片公司，拍攝兩部影片。一部是楊小仲導演的「民族的火花」，還有一部是李萍倩導演的「離家曲」。</p>
<p>至於外埠，北平有「中電三廠」。「聖誠記」已上演了。現在在拍「天字第一號」，曙光導演，歐陽莎飛主演。</p>
<p>長春的「中電四廠」，也就是「長春制片廠」，由金由主持，接收過去的「滿映」。可是器材都給工產黨拿光了，現在只能拍拍新聞片。香港的電影事業，正在不斷蓬勃滋長。如「大中華影片公司」，「國家影片公司」等。</p>
<p>總之，國產片是絕對有前途的。但它需要大家的扶助，大家的愛護。</p>

<h3>改善公共衛生　市民建議三點</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕市參議會昨接本市市民丁福葆呈函，建議市府改善本市衛生設施，來函略謂：勝利一載有餘，市府接辦市政勛績卓著，惟衛生局接管數事，實有未盡然者，特建議三點：（一）淸潔所自該局接辦以來，市庫按月增加一大收人，然其出售肥料價格，實應調整，以符農村施肥之用，不應如包商時之方針，將售價隨便增加，不顧農民購買力，同時工作部份亦應除舊更新。（二）公厕爲市區嘉惠平民而設，應由市衛生局派員直轄管理，以最低草紙售價，以利平民爲目標。始符設立之本意，而市府按月亦可增收人，豈知該局竟仍採用包商舊制，使大包小包等層層剝削，個中漁利，實應改良。（三）本市垃圾每日遺棄，其數量可觀，此事亦不應由包商辦理，蓋包商只圖漁利，搬運工作每每敷衍塞責，致時有堆積，同時搬運船隻甚少，沿途漏落，以致內河及浦江發生淤塞，望當局能購辦登陸艇俾大量載運。</p>

<h3>吳燧人案起訴書　移用公款廿七億犯貪污罪嫌</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕行總總務處出納科科長吳燧人。移用公款二十七億一案，經地檢處一月來之偵查，業已終結，承辦檢察官劉用之，認爲吳燧人利用職權，對以主管出納事務，挪移公款，直接岡利，案發後雖將所有移用之公款本利歸庫，但與其直接岡利之旣遂行爲不能有所帮助，故依懲治貪汚條例第三條第六款：「對於主管或監督之事務，直接或間接圖利者，處死刑，無期徒刑，或七年以上有期徒刑」，提起公訴。起訴書全文如下：</p>
<p>吳燧人，男，四十歲，住北四川路東嘉路瑞豐里二號，充行政院善後救濟總署出納科科長。</p>
<p>右開被吿因貪汚嫌疑一案（卅五年偵甲字第五三二五〇號），業經偵查終結，認爲應行起訴，茲將犯罪事實及證據，幷所犯法條開列如左：</p>
<p>吳燧人充行政院善後救濟總署出納科科長有年，主管行總出納，職掌署款收支責任綦重，行總負託至殷，該被吿近乃</p>
<p>利令智昏　假借主管職務之權力機會，直接圖利，本年十月二十二日南京行總出納科交中央銀行南京分行條匯上海中央銀行交上海行總出納科匯款一筆，計國幣二十七億元，記明係聯總九月份經費，撥這行總之墊款，由國庫撥交京署交央行逕匯收款人，抬頭爲行總總務處出納科，此款於十月廿四日匯到上海央行，該被吿於接受通知後，翌日（即十月二十五日）單獨簽軍，憑單前赴上海</p>
<p>央行提款　幷由中央信託局信託處背書及註明「收抬頭人帳」字樣，經央行匯兌職員核對手續無異，准將該筆匯款全數交付中央信託局本票，由被吿直接如數領光，當時該款交換收付情形幷未報吿行總主管，亦瞞不通知財務廳長會計處長等主管人員，該被吿膽敢潛移此筆鉅款，私行分頭託友放款，牟取重利，乃至一角四五之多，其中一部款項，計一億元，係被吿自己放出或化用，十億元仍未動用，嗣經行總奉到京署電知此款已經匯出，飭查收具報，該管署長據查收款情形嚴詰被吿，該被吿已知事洩無法掩飾，旋將私提公款移用，放款國利經過遂一供出，幷允將所放各款</p>
<p>追回本利　歸庫，行總以其職司出納，竟將公款移挪圖利，當予撤職，函送依法偵辦到處。本處密拘被吿到案，幾經鞫訊，該被吿直認移用公款圖利不諱，並稱本利全數歸還行總等語，核與行總及央行之復函，業已收回全數二十七億元係分次交出，計十月卅一日還十一億元，十一月四日還六億元，十一月六日還一億元，十一月七日還九億元，十一月十四日交出利息一千四百六十萬元，此款當日由吳燧人以出納科長名義出面提取，蓋有出納科吳燧人圖章，該被吿所供以單獨出名其領此款，幷已還帳之事，尙可取信，縱上情節該被吿吳燧人利用職權機會，對以主管出納之事務，移用公款，直接圖利，</p>
<p>罪證明確　案發後雖將所有移用公款本利歸庫，其於直接圖利之旣遂行爲幷無影響，縱而被吿實際上圖利與否原非所問，揆諸歷來判解，核被吿之行爲實犯懲治貧汚條例第三條第六款之罪，委無疑義，應依刑事訴訟法第二百三十條第一項起訴。</p>

<p>據被害人家屬稱：彼等原籍蘇北，於淪陷時期，駕船來江南謀生，去年廢曆元月十六日，彼等小船停泊於靑浦縣境第五區西安鄉小寅鄉附近老宅河浜地方，被害人黃顧氏等十六人，相約上岸拾草，路遇該處鄕民楊阿大等，發生口角，旋由偽鄕長鄒實賢偽保長薛順德等，率領鄉民三四十人，手持扁担釘耙，將被害人</p>
<p>圍住兇毆　當塲十六人中有周六者即被毆斃命。除劉小二子一人逃脫，其餘十四人即被捆縛，迨至夜間，偽鄕長鄒實賢等竟慘無人道，將寶顧氏等男女老幼十四口一併慘殺減口。該案經被害人家屬於去年三月三日控於偽齊浦縣政府，偽縣長黃烈文賄賂公行，竟准兇犯保釋，並遏令被害人家屬具結，領取卹金偽幣十萬元，限期出境。當時迫於敵偽淫威，無法可想，現在高檢處以漢奸殺人罪提起公訴，深望能將兇犯早日處刑，俾使被害寃魂九泉之下得以瞑目云。</p>
<p>被吿鄒實賢衣長袍，供稱曾做地下工作，被害人等係强盜，因搶劫被格斃，在他管轄地點，但他並未指揮，其他情形諉稱不知。第二被吿陳阿木在上次庭訊中供稱四十二歲，昨忽供稱二十六歲，經向追請，彼謂確係廿六歲，本案犯罪者係其堂兄，是小寅鄉鄉長命他來頂替的，審至此，庭上以本案情形復雜，尚需詳細調查，論知改期再訊。</p>

<h3>讀者咨詢　法律質疑</h3>
<p>（一）盜賣房產</p>
<p>孫寄萍問甲乙丙三人於戰前在杭州共有平房一進，係祖土遺產，民國二十六年起該屋由丁看管，（因甲乙丙三人出門在外）杭州淪陷二三年後，該屋看管人丁未得甲乙丙三人之同意，擅自出賣與韓某，產價六萬元，韓某又轉賣與金某，價十二萬元，後又由金某轉賣與漢奸俞某，產價三十餘萬元，勝利後當局緝捕金某，聽說俞某早已聞風而逃，該屋現爲中央信託局查封，據聞現有標賢幾千萬元之說，自下乙丙二人尙未返浙，而甲不幸在抗戰期間在外病故，現甲子由內地返浙，逕與丁晤面後，始悉上項情形，茲有甲子欲收回房產主權，敬請指答。（一）甲子是否可代乙丙收回房產主權？（二）該屋如依法起訴有無希望收回？（三）根據民法第……條「共有產未得共有同人意」依法起訴是否有效？其他尙有類似條例可作有效之起訴？（四）收回時有並無其他重要手續辦理？事實上困難否？</p>
<p>「曹亞俠律師答」（一）不可。（但甲子如己合法繼承其父甲之財產則可主張共有權。或並由乙丙委任其代理行使所有權）（二）有望（三）有效。又民法第七五八條規定，不動產物權依法律行爲而取得設定及變更者，非經登記，不生效力。（四）向法院提起確認該土地買賣無效之訴，並向管理敵偽產業之機關具呈聲明。</p>
<p>（二）女方悔婚</p>

<h3>供源愈缺需要愈旺　金鈔齊創新高價　黃金已出三百萬大關　美鈔黑市高至五千七</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕烚赤昨謠風更盛，買氣復熾，再度告漲，晨開二九〇萬五，上場時難免被壓力所屈服而呈徘徊，一度退至二八九萬五光景，始復轉穩，迨二九〇萬大開竟告站定，人心復好，十時後央行以二九一萬二五之價　給四〇〇條，此後賣戶復擁，好事者附和之，央行供源逐步後退，於是午刻竟步張至二九六萬五左右。午後隔夜交割激昂逾恒，最後竟躍升至三〇一萬左右。較前收猛升十一萬三。飾金掛高至卅一萬六，紋銀銀元均乏變動，暗拆銀根平平，暗息仍自一角二至一角半之間。</p>
<p>外　有進無退，美鈔自長初之五二五〇元起，一再扳高，午刻竟拉上至五六〇〇元左右，五後廣續拉高至五七〇〇元，較前日漲起四百餘元。港票在缺貨之情況下，最後竟步昂至一一五〇元以上，賣買價拔開甚至鉅，較前猛漲一一〇元，港匯有買無褒，最後在一一〇〇元。印匯一三四〇元，英　一七五〇一元，形勢過於混亂，是以成交反少。</p>
<p>美鈔步漲之因素</p>
<p>關於美鈔步漲之原因，傳說紛紛，莫哀一是。記者特往訪　經濟專家，據說，些次美鈔漲因，約有數端：</p>
<p>（一）自新貿易管制辦法公布後，核售外匯一時陷於停頓狀態，供給中斷，美鈔乃乘機上應</p>
<p>（二）最近美籍船隻到滬特多，有若乾進口商因外泯無着，不得不擭求美鈔，以養抵補，開此次進口商扒購最力，即係此果。</p>
<p>（三）國際銀行即將公布各國匯率，前傳十二月份爲吾國匯率作最後決定之關鍵，一般感覺靈敏之投機家，俱乘機猛吸美鈔，抬高價格。</p>
<p>（四）外埠銀根湧到滬埠，致滬金融業頭寸鬆動，而節近年關，消納途經狹窄，見美鈔趨勢堅挺，遂　趨奪購，亦爲激動漲價之一大原因。</p>
<p>（五）近來中央銀行對於黃金價格不取積極抑低政策，引起一般人之猜疑，認爲金鈔前途大有作爲，樂觀派積極購進，以待變動，此爲投機心理之又一面，足以促使鈔價之波動。</p>
<p>發行新鈔毫無根據</p>
<p>又訊，市塲謠傳中央銀行即將發行世額鈔，並謂外匯率又將調整。記者因又分訪各關係當局，探詢流言之虛實。</p>
<p>據中央銀行發行局局長梁平語記者稱：渠未聞央行有發行鉅額票面新鈔之傳說，且央行當局亦未嘗考慮該項措施。故該項傳說，頭係空穴來風，全乏事實根據。</p>
<p>又調整匯率之說，雖愈傳愈盛，惟據權威之觀察家談稱：徵以目前情形，調整匯率，在事實上及時間上，似均無此需要。　政府當局，最近頒行修正進出口貿易辦法，政府擬從加強管制進口貿易，以撙節我國外匯資源之意向，已彰彰明。新貿易辦法方施行後，過去各界目目向外定貨，致造成鉅額外匯外溢之病態，當可　逐步矯正。外匯資源之壓力既蜇告松動，當毋須又考應過整匯率也。又徵以上次調整外匯率時，一般物價即追蹤上漲，其上漲比例，且有超過於外匯率調整之比例者。結果，其爲害之程度，且甚於匯率之維持不變。故如無特殊需要，政府決不致再貿然作此得不考未考未償失之調整也。</p>
<h3>公債仍形呆定</h3>
<p>公債昨仍形呆定，統丙經五五二室買進，自長開一一五〇元起，步升至二三〇元而稍定，較前收漲起八十元，甲乙升五十元，丁跌十元，統戊尚平，成交紙百餘萬元。</p>
<h3>米市續疲</h3>
<p>米市南北共到七千餘石，形成到銷兩淡，市勢依然萎靡不振，仍難生色，南北粳續見低落三五百元，秞米隨之軟化，白陰元交易清懈，客元呆滯，麵粉步削一二百元，麸皮去化不爽，豆餅台灣略進，價無出入，黃豆油廠及台灣稍動，東北大豆回升三五百元，中原黃豆暫無呼吸，茶豆南洋續進，再提千元，芝藏穩固，生仁廣方揀高納取，市面仍居高削次呆之勢，苞米青島去胃仍殷，到不敵銷，價格步砌，高而愈固，汕市生油去路仍懈，市價鮮有變化，豆油店方交易尚可，形勢轉堅，略加一二千元，藤油漢口蚱埠來貨尚續，市面穩定。</p>
<h3>存款準備金　財部准予減低</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市商業行莊繳存中央銀行之存款準備金，活存本爲百分之二十，定存本爲百分十五，茲中央銀行業已接奉財政部批示，准將該項存款準備金，每種減低百分之五。計活存爲百分之十五，定存爲百分之十。央行刻已分函知各行莊查照。聞各行莊如已照舊定比例繳存者，可按新比例退回餘額云。</p>
<h3>籌碼充斥　紗市疲憊</h3>
<p>紗市疲莫能興，因霧售商配紗下千五百件，已告解決，籌碼益充養之棉紗，汗牛充棟，律標者追於銀要，滿塲兜售，二十支紗續小三四萬元，三十二支以上紗綫，去化尤滯，乏人問津，綫機廠製成品不易推動，無意添配原料</p>
<h3>受金價上升影響　人絲廠經轉漲</h3>
<p>人造絲昨市上午仍形疲滯，下午受金價上升影響。人心稍堅，一二〇號有光更　牌子上午做三百廿二萬元，下午喊三百四十萬元，高山牌子上午做三百十六萬元，下午喊三百卅萬元，比上日大起十四五萬元。不過下午成交甚少。其餘如一二〇號半元，因乏人過問，喊價反較上日略短，且俱無做開。廠經昨市人心頗堅，因傳說秋　由中　公司收購，價六百萬元，將成事實。更因下午金價昂升，故喊價圖高，不過成交仍　。昨只有中蠢公司開出D字等級十五包，價做三百九十五萬元。綢貨類皆疲呆，被面及華錦綿均小。</p>

<p>關中霜雪滿田園（上）  西安四日　航訊　本報特派員邵慎之　　「羣頭不見畏安」，係　辯長安之遠。我訪涇　渠區，躍　金鎖關下後，折返長安，在西京招待所樓顯，農業運個古城，覺得它對於中部和陝北還是遠。不料我的短短二百里北行旅松，竟費了整聲十一天時間。　　旅途中常有人問長安景象，也使人有遠的感覺。　　生活於田園中的人，不知長安，長安對他們遠。而近的則是棉價，賦稅和水利，甚至馬　——他們細心檢藏，準備作過冬燃料。一個新挖的窰洞，在一個冬天裏燒成一個烟囱。正像一羣穴居的　鼠，瞇蔚紅腫的沙眼，舉頭不見天日。　　依稀古都長安情調　　到關中的人都要想到遠。想到周秦漢唐；慈禧逃離；想到李儀社邵力子和租藕初；想到西安事變和似不可接的延安。　　一個專攻歷史的大學生，憑他的智識也不足以應付關中的故蹟。况且秦人有揑造故蹟的習慣。著名的碑林也要過冬，十一月十五日起，便不准碑帖商去搨取，要等陽春來時開放。這是常年老例。戰時有些占碑用泥封好，怕遭轟炸。不過著名的「玄秘塔」，「顏家廟」，「僧懷素」，「　化閣法帖」，都已一再加鐫，字跡臃腫不堪，有些碑帖，商人還公然造假，正如洛陽的古董一樣，但旅行長安者往往帶一些這樣的東西回去，作爲特產禮物。　　然而帶不回去的是一種情調：清真館有吃一碗飽一天的羊肉泡　；穿牛鼻短靴，戴白色小帽，口啣長早烟袋的回人堂倌，怪腔高呌，令人驚奇；本地堂倌中的好手，則站在門口用秦腔呌喊，那就是說，在唱歌；這樣一來，一條短短的街道，就可羿得很熱鬧，况且還有吱吱軋軋的賣水車。西安人說：要不是西安事變，邵力子先生己給我們辦好自來水了。能解決五十萬人的飲水問題，就可以算是政績，可見中國政事亦難亦易。　　讀建築史的人總要以羅馬來舉例，彷彿歷史起自羅馬似的。不料戰時舉辦特種工程時，在郊外挖出漢唐的地下引水這來，從此古羅馬引水道將不是唯一的東西。道又是古己有之，而於今則是　如的。　　李儀祉因爲把水供給更多的人，至今涇原人爭道李先生。這位頑强的浦城人畢生矢志於整黃河，結果是未克獲願，一代工程家，臨終時在病床上受洗，信仰了上帝。他的妹妹李翥儀女士對我說；「李先生是焦急死的，一定要他做黃河水利委員會委員長，可是又不能照她的辦法做。」生在只可做官，不要做事的時代，是李先生的不幸。英雄的悲　也許是歷史的宿命吧？歸結到上帝，却有他高潔的光輝在。　　坐在黑光漆的方桌前，桌上面用彩漆描題着天寒有鶴守梅花的　，窗外有雪片悉悉嚮，穿着西口　皮長袍，吃着火鍋，酒酣耳熱，也自是長安的一種生活，這是西北風。西北風每處　故都北平，就是聽不見駝鈴可　。方城，道路，域樓高　，泛起「片白淡的光色，一切是占拙的。掩着耳朶的呌賣聲，悠然而過深院，也像故都。一個濃髪的新疆人，穿着高統黑皮馬靴，頭戴　花的哈蔣克便帽，在夕陽下擺一個擻子，零賣自玉門關外帶來的葡萄乾。可是他失望了，在風裏貶着棕色的眼睛。看肥大的烏鴉，長得又黑又亮，成　任意起落。　一個五十萬人口的城市，有九千個人力軍夫，二千五百個妓女，這是官方的數字，謂之公娼，可見謀生的困難。陝西省政府端坐在　皂城裏，自馮王祥的督署以至現在，守着官不修衙的法則。有些懸政人員以信奉老子哲學的奧旨見稱，而有些人相信言論必須統制，也相信思想要劃一才好。一個警察局負担了執行平價的重責，把經濟問題看成治安問題了。長安的混煤賣到廿四萬元一噸，而同官　縣不過四五萬元，可惜的是從未用起碼的遠警罰法辦一辦隴海鐵路局長。　　麻痺和遲鈍的交通也有好處，它幾乎可以使關中造成閉關自守的局面；高昂的運費和旅費，使上海進口貨在關中比上海貴一倍以上，這也可以抵擋一陣小潮水。關中人把一種Domino牌香烟譯成杜魯門香烟賣。有一種西安寶鷄襲造的硫化燐火柴，刮着時嗤嗤亂饗，如放熖火，等十秒鐘左右才能得出結論來，名謂抗戰火柴，它的地位仍然極穩固。而用含脂羊毛絞出的平凉毛線，名謂西北毛線，五顏六色都有，鮮艷刺目，不過一萬元一市斤，所以版夫走卒都能有一件毛線衫。身穿大紅大黃毛衫的人力車夫，在馬路上人羣中躍動，滿頭大汗，自近而遠，彷彿是跳動的皮球。因爲省穿裏衣，一身大汗後脫下來，便染得半身通是顏色，頗成奇觀。　　第二十航空隊的一位美國上尉，來去成都西安間，　其所得，在兩地的古董鋪中搜購烟董，自瑪瑙，翡翠，白玉以及用木塊雕成的，各式各樣，一位朋友送他走，六百幾十個鼻烟壺裝成兩大箱，自長安展翅而去。他將來很可能成爲中國鼻烟壺專家。中國的秘密與神奇，大致已發掘光了，而剩下的，還是殷周時代的大車，西安的打車舖，擁有西北的權威地位，他們打出的軍輪，竟和　作寅氏在安陽掘出的殉葬寶物金無二致。就是這樣的輪子，在黃土原上的田　中，走了五千年。　　滿車霜月　且問田園　　不問兵戈，且問田園。我坐着這樣的大車，去訪問涇專渠區。　　廿一日侵晨，　海路的北上車開出了，天還沒有亮。號誌伕在腰間掛着一個黃銅角，嗚嗚的吹起來，載着一車霜月，慢慢出站，天色漸明。到達咸陽，已經日滿古渡。在三橋站附近北望阿房宮故址，簡直毫無遺跡。史記載秦都咸陽，二百里內建宮觀二百七十，複通縱橫，一時稱盛。曹植詩云：「壯哉帝王居」。而現在秦宮漢殿，都蕩然無存，如果要研究秦代建築的實物資料，大抵只有幾塊龐大的空心磚。昔人以咸陽古渡入詩，鐵路沒有通的時候，此處原是西去陽關的孔道。直到現在，還是一個渡頭。這古渡就在咸陽站附近。渭河的沙灘長得十分寬大，遠遠看到一行行白楊衰柳，陽關驛道，覺得自己是在舊時代，昔人自長安東行者，在霸橋折柳送別，黯然涕下，楊柳在舊中國文學上成爲表現離愁的象徵，多數的中國智識份子都不免受其影響，這楊柳該是這裏的楊柳，但楊柳逼生中國，最易惹動鄕思。　　咸陽的轉轍道向着實鷄，從西安到咸同支綫必須調車，在銅角嗚嗚聲中，把軍顯和守車的位置換過來，這才向北爬坡，進入涇惠渠區。路西北一帶黃土原，係漢陵墓所在，所謂「一坏黃土」，只能在這一帶說，南方是不合的。初過漳關，君到一些紅色土，以爲紅壤，這是我的錯誤，實則主體和中原一樣都是黃土。二十里外的文王武王陵，高高隆起，仍然在望。渭河以北古陵墓之多，難以數計，離　演變，都已盜掘，漢高祖，惠帝，呂后，戚夫人，以及漢代若干名臣，都葬於此。過長陵高莊兩站，可遙望涇陽城，涇陽十三層古塔巍峙原上，面涇陽原是唐十八學士傲遊地。這一帶已是涇惠渠區。望不盡的一行一行白楊。凡是渠道所經之處，兩岸是密密的白楊，隴陌界址，也是密密的白楊。白楊生得　直，沒有一根細校不向上直冲，而行列又直，田畝劃界齊整，這時正是棉一化登塲，一望無際的棉田，沃野萬頃，這就是關中農業的成就和希望所在。　　經渭合流地區，是關中平原的心臟，它的跳動可以直接說明全區農業脈搏的跳動。我在水桀店下車，此去三原還有二十多華里，傷騾車到十里外的涇陽農塲和陝省農業改進所私立儀祉農校去。　　「啊！噓！」一聲，擇着鞭子，騾車震動起來，彎彎曲曲的往西北行，朝向楊梧村。這騾事還是新打的，漆水退亮，鉸縺結實，　子也壯，逆面不時碰到認識車主的路人，問道：「啊嚏去？你打的？」頗有親熱的羨意。　　這趕車的一面應答，一面不斷啊啊噓噓。我起先知道這瘦小的車主姓戚，後來才知這是姓帖，這兩個音剛剛和我讀個倒。而水井則變成了水汀。他原在部隊裏當特務長，去年就不幹了，回得家來做莊稼，他們兄弟三人有田六十畝，該是相當闊的小自耕農。這付新置的傢私，連騾帶車値兩百多萬，而這一帶盡是這樣「耕者有其田」的農民。然而他們僱有河南逃難過來的人做長短工。說是今年下種前旱了四十天，一下種使下了四十天，棉籽長不住，到結鈴時又下了四十天，雨水不勻，收成欠佳，平均每畝今年收八九十斤，否則當在百斤開外。談話間充份感激這條渠，否則「我們就活不旺。」　　關中平原有水利建設，始於泰。水工鄭國，引涇水入洛，灌田四萬餘頃。漢有白公引渠入渭，故歷史上以鄭白渠統稱。東漢遷洛陽後，水利盡廢，唐時僅及萬頃，以後時有修廢，終無秦漢規模，經左宗棠平回戰後，可耕之地不及百頃。李儀祉設渭北水利工程局，最初理想最多灌五六萬頃，同時想兼顧航運，但因財才限制，放棄了後半部的計劃。十九年動工，廿四年全部究成，灌溉涇陽，高陵，三原，酸泉，臨　屬地七十三萬畝。去年實灌六十五萬畝，收穫食糧六十九萬市石。棉花二十一萬市担。此　核心在涇陽張家山的　，如果壩身再事增高，當可再增灌溉面積。　　關中八水，前爲止，還以涇水最收灌溉之効。渭水長逾千里，彙淵洛水而注黃河，流量不減蘭州黃河，黃河之患，實在渭和山西的汾水。這是陝西水利家的意見。蘭州的黃河流量不過五千幾百秒立方公尺，黃河治本，不必上蘭州，在汾渭建蓄水池，就可解決大部問題。不知中囑水利家已大多意見一致否？　　騾車馳行於棉隴中，裝儎棉花的大車在鞭聲中搖搖幌幌而過，村落中有軋棉機聲。很難見到破房子，農家都門牆整潔，　祉農校的屋舍允新，塲地和走道上都是棉花，正在收穫。校長李　儀女士跳出來說：　　「能跑到鄉下來看看我們，我們就非常高興了。我們都是鄕下土包子啊！」　　美國人赫契生那老頭兒也曾來過了，他的目的來看水利程，這個窰迫萬狀的農校，在這羣「洋娃兒」眼下不佔分量，可是累他們忙了一大陣。這老頭兒替美國打算，頗驚詫於這裏的水利建設遠　秦漢。他的結論認爲：相信我們美國的水利工程也能持久。　　棉隴紅花荒原功人　　農校的大門裏一片園地，走這上堆滿棉花，中間是一大畦月季，像火一樣噴射着又大又紅的花朶，衝破了寂寞。這確是不易見到的花朶。月季花很容易種植，很容易開令人十分滿意的花，而不容易種植的是理想的花，在玻璃房裏開花結實，費了很大的本錢，到底不能散播到大地上去—中國的農事科學工作者，就有道種悲哀—成爲現實政治的　刺話柄。　　關中區的美棉種子從民國十八年下起，其間有一條相當曲折的生長道路，今天才算有四號斯字棉從黃土裏　起來開花。這塊土地上自李儀社以至現在的農事敎習與科學工作者，都是在一張白紙上，點滴書寫下他們的文章。寫下什麼便看見什麼，這是他唯一的安慰。這裏實在是中國的好棉區。他們雖然守住了自己的崗，自己對自說：「不管外面亂得怎樣，咱們死抱住這個工作不放，只管幹下去吧。」可是棉麥價格的動滋，不斷襲擊着他們的信念。現在當地棉價低到十五萬八千元一担，收七十斤一畝，才十二萬五千元，同樣以植棉的勞力資本，則可收小麥一担，現價十一萬元，玉蜀黍二担，現價十三萬元。棉農說：「種棉劃不來了。」於是放棄棉植，讓美棉湧進來。　　申新，中棉大華收買經惠渠的棉花，有卞要的市塲影響，他們看上海市價，地方人士罵他們用托辣斯手段來操縱。這些農事工作者一隻眼看到四號斯字棉綻出白亮的花，另一隻眼看來却是　然無光。　　李儀祉拆下廟宇的材料來，興修渭北水利工程，遇到農民的反對。現在一所紀念他的私立農校設立在這裏，周圍的農戶送他們的子弟來上學。因爲要添建校舍，捐募材料，送來的居然多是從廟宇中拆來。這些農家子弟大多還沒有看見過電燈。他們遠遠的聚着，遙望辦公室裏的一位服裝異樣的來客。　　卅一年開辦的時候，只有一個校長，一個敎員和一個工友，借了涇陽農塲的房子開課。四百八十畝校產是涇陽農塲撥來的。自種三百畝，作爲附屬農場，一百畝倒租給涇陽農塲用。學校和農塲比鄰而居，在空曠的棉隴中成一個獨立的田莊。四百畝的租益八千斤棉花，只能支付四個敎員，可是全體敎職員廿人，兼任敎員四人，開辦以來，招了十一班學生，畢業三班，一班從軍，全在二〇七師，遠戍東北。現在有七班，二百九十四人，三班高級水利科，農藝科高初級共兩班，初中兩班。校長說：「都是土頭土腦，要是交通方便，總要帶他們出去走一走」。說是英文程度低，難得很，請不到理想的敎師。學生不收學費，陝敎廳出了三班的經費，名爲委託辦理。現在算來，每年收入一千萬元，不敷的二千萬元無着落除非校董會能够籌　億元基金，有關水利機關補助，否則祗有請改省立。今年三原，涇陽，高陵三縣地方爲他們籌了一千萬元，終覺捐募度日終不是辦法。然而長先生自信得很，「總歸有辦法的」。　　「你看，我們已建了道些間校舍了。而且還有頭乳牛，因此我們這些窮敎員還不少牛奶喝」。說着時，特地叫人去拿來嚮容。組織生產敎育，闢了四十畝果園，桃樹已經移植，今年種了八十株沙果苗，完成了芽接蘋果。道些植物的開花結果，又描書了一幅遠景：明年收桃子，後年收渡果，再過三年四年以後就如何如何。這農校便充滿了女性化的現實理想。　　辦公室裏掛着李儀祉的遺像，望着隔窗的月季。他的遺囑距今已有八年，現在看來還是値得發表。遺囑說：　　「余深感水利事業在中國之重要，幼年即以改求水利學識自矢。民四由德返國，迄今已逾廿三年。在此期內，已竭盡余之所能，貢獻國家；但距余素日所期望者尙遠。茲病逾二週，自度天不假年，切望後起同人，對於江河治導，本余之素志，繼續致力，以科學方法，探討其他。防災，航運及水電等，允應多事研究，次第實施。太省已成立之灌溉事業，須妥爲管理。其未竟及尙未着手之水利工程，應竭盡人力財力，以求於短期內逐漸完成」。　李儀社使道塊土地開了花，這些「土頭土腦」的學生受着李儀祉的影響，安知不能使更多的土地開出花來？　　棉織維以長爲好，棉鈴以多爲好，產量則以大爲好。中國的農作以一畝地出得越多越好，美國人則以一個人種得越多越好。中國的社愈條件，包括土地制度與工業規模，決定了農業科學研究的傾向，種端的便鑽入了牛角尖去。　　涇惠渠區最好的收成，一畝地可以收一百廿斤棉花，美國一般產量不過二十至卅斤。然而他們一個人可以種一千畝地，收穫總量可觀。這裏的棉作排列很密，如果沒有蟋蟀科的昆蟲，危害幼苗，每株結一顆棉鈴，也能收十斤，以此推算，十顆鈴即得一担。　　機器生產的更多和手工業生產的更多薄出了矛盾。而科學研究者大祇不能統收全部問題到一個焦　上，捨棄了現存的社會條性使等於空談。　　涇　渠區有三個農塲，一個屬於金陵大學；在涇陽，一個是于右任辦的斗口農塲，在三源西關外；一個就是道裏的陝省農業改進所涇陽農塲。他們都以棉花小麥爲主題，斗口農塲更注意到園藝。涇陽農塲實際上負着農業行政與科學研究的雙黨責任。中農所自廿九年起就派員駐塲主持技術工作。涇陽農塲十二年來的工作成就，其經過是一條頗爲使人驚奇的道路。　　關中有美棉，應自十八年陝西大早時說起。當時穆耦初榮宗敬捐穆氏美棉（多純種靈寳棉）籽二百噸推廣。廿年李國楨由鄭州送脫字棉籽五十斤入陝；廿三年陝建廳和棉業統制委員會又大量輸入靈寳棉，加之本地原種的小洋花和中棉，品種混雜。廿三年至廿七年抗戰，這五年之中，涇陽農場和中農所，中央棉產改進所合作，辦理全國規模的棉作區域試騐，搜集優良的品種。關中區由涇陽農塲負責主持，五年以來，用二十種到四十八種的品種，用同樣的田間設計，試騐結果，四號斯字美佔優勝，與脫字棉對照，產量的最高紀錄，超過百分之十八點八。織維長達廿八公厘點二，比脫字棉靈寶棉小洋花長過二點八公厘至六公厘。在試騐期間，已大致育定四號斯字棉比較優異，廿五年即開始推廣，於今不及十年，關中已處處斯字棉普及百萬畝以上。有織維更長的品種，但是鈴子輕，含棉少。然而工作並不就是完結。　　「設備不够啊！」塲長魯承周嚷着，所謂暖室，就是地上挖個坑，蓋上幾小塊玻璃。揭開草蓆，他指給我看。他們無疑需一要套比較完整的儀器和一個較大的暖房，才可做更多的分析工作。其價格決不會超過一尊七五砲。他們做過了品種比來選系比較等育種試騐，傲過了肥料試騐和遺傳試騐。而七年以的最令人興　的發現，是中美棉雜交的成功。解決了歷來認爲不可能的難題。主持道工作的是中農所的俞啓葆先生，他上三原城去了，可惜沒有遇到他，不能知道得更多。我跑到田裏去看，那株雜交成功的棉株，比一人一手還高，長了一百多個種子，已經摘下，滿身　着紀錄紙片。父本美國紅葉棉並不高，母本中國小白花，更差從二十九年試騐起，去年勝利，可結了一個鈴，得到一顆珍逾明珠的種子，今年下種，竟獲得令人驚奇的收獲。　　去年結鈴的那株，剪下後放入暖室過冬，今年再也不結鈴。校長先生遂給它取了一個名稱：　子棉。鈴子比父太或母本長得更大更結賞。　　不過現在所能證明的，僅是：中美棉可以雜交。今年收穫還要待來年繼續試騐。這就是農業的遲鈍性。關中的棉產要躍過四號斯字棉，走上更長更多的道路，過去的關中棉作研究工作並未陷在玻璃房裏，今後也必不會。　　然而這羣農業科學與敎育工作者擺出十足的書凱子面孔，說：我們要問問懂得經濟學的人，中國有辦法沒有？　　中國農學家重大發現中美棉雜交成功　　中國以一畝地出得越多越好，美國以一個人種得越多越好，機器與手工決定了科學研究者所依存的社會條件。審草第二審委會別記　孔庚埋下的炸彈卒告爆發　和平老人邵力子無可奈何  京十一日訊　本報駐京記者德玢　　憲草第二審委會午後開會時，「國大派」大大得勢，幾天以前，老孔庚放下的一顆炸彈爆發了，一開始討論就有人提出在　三軍開頭，加列一條規定團民大會的性質。主席是民社黨的朱飾　，他請邵力子先報告，邵力子說：「關於國大的性質，不但　正案未列，五五憲草也沒列，憲草上旣沒有，是否可以不討論呢？」有人說：「要不得！」「要不得！」張潘華站起來說：「五五憲草和修正案都未列，必定有它的理由，我主張請邵先生說明一下。」朱主席就請邵先生說下去，一部會衆也數掌。邵說：「治權是屬於政府的應有最高機關，政權則不然，應以全體國民爲最後掌握者。國大如爲行使政權的最高機關，就是以間接民權來阻止直接民權的最後實現，則置民衆於何地？」但這個意見並沒有被按受贊同的，除了陶希聖的一個書面意見外，沒人敢說話。相反的意見，却粉紛而來，這個說；「正因爲憲草沒有，才要提出來，以表現民權。」那個說：「在間接民權時代，自然應該有代表人民的最高政權機關，全體國民不是　關，就是直接民權實現了，國民無法自動的行使政檀，這一條實非加上不可。」一邊說，一邊催着表決，結果這是勝利地通過，加一條：「　民大會爲中華民國行使政權之最高機關。一邵力子無可奈何的走出去。訊者關心他的健康，問：「邵先生好了罷？」他搖搖頭，正如陶希聖說的這一條通避後，原來第廿六，廿七兩條都受影響。憲草的基本制度都要　更了，果然，等一小會第廿六條的立監委爲國大代表的規定就被推翻了，相信關於第廿七條將在十二日的會上也發生突變。審查結果，勢必將與第二審委會順利獲致的審查結果發生極端的矛盾，以致不能同時提出大會。朱鴻儒主席問靑年黨的易維精召集人，全部無可奈何。「和平老人」的頭痛，怕還要繼續下去吧。（上）西安碑林外景（下）陝西省水利局（本報特派員邵慣之攝）　　涇陽農塲中美棉雜交成功，第一顆種子所成長之棉株，高逾二公尺，結鈴百餘枚。　（特派員邵愼之攝）　　三原西關渠道邊之運棉大車　　（特派員邵價之攝）救救皖小農村  六日合肥訊　本報駐皖記者白萍　　感謝上帝，皖中一帶今年的確是鑒收的，然而，農民們，尤其是貧農，當稻穀登塲時帶笑的嘴臉知今消逝盡了，代替的是焦急和嘆息，他們在流淚了！　　不論你走向任何一個鄉村，假使你和任何一個農民作半小時的談話，對現時多數的農民生活，便會知道一個梗概，換句話說，就是今天佔着人口絕對最多數的農民，他們是過着怎樣窮苦的日子，他們是怎樣在種種不合理的生活環境中來打發這悠長的歲月！我們以農立國的國家，農民們竟然遭遇了厄運！　　年年高利貨　循環無盡期　　今天，雖是通貨膨脹，雖是都市裏鈔票滿天飛，然而在農村裏却仍是稀罕的東西，普通一個農戶極少有機會存放着十萬元以上的現款，有些時候爲了凑成幾萬元的數目，甚至跑借好多家，農村經濟枯竭，至此近　於破產了！　　農民們在鄕村裏交易，農乎完全是以米來代替法幣，死了人買棺材，價格以米的多少來決定，買　一塊田地，也以米米成交，因爲農民們也懂得物價波動不定，法幣過些時候便會貶値，惟有實物才不致於吃　，反正實物總是水漲船高，物價漲，米價也漲，　糧米比　握法幣要種當得多？　　但是，貧農們再也沒有方法逃避高利貸的剝削呀，當春夏間靑黃不接的時候，貧農們沒有吃糧了，而這時正是農事緊張的時候，萬無方法束緊褲帶在田野間做一天苦工，只有走借糧的一條路，此時，極少數多糧者機會來了，偕一石米，說定在秋收時償還兩石或兩石半，或者把米作成當時的時價，當時米價總比秋收後高得多，按月算三分乃至四分的十利息，如比，到　還這　　時，榖價正低，非出賣三石米就無法淸還，還有在借糧時給錢，那就是鄕間所謂買靑苗，譬如當時米價三萬元一石，說定借三萬元，到秋間還米三石。再有就是借錢按月還利，這多是四分利息，譬如今天借了一萬元，下月今天如不能還本，必須送繳四千元息金，若是無力送息，這四千元又變成本錢而成爲借額一萬四千元了，因此，借了一萬元，兩個月後本利便是一萬九千六百元了。也再有，債主唯恐放貸而收不到本利，借款時使選擇吿貸者所有的實物作爲本利，譬如，吿貸者收糧不多，但他以義鴨或養豬爲副業，便說定借一萬元，將來還鴨子多少隻，或者豬肉多少斤，自然比拿綫殺直接支購買時要便宜三四倍了。　　鄕村裏普通一個農戶，就少有一家收毅在百石以上，多半幾十石而已，要是佃農，繳給田主應得以後，所賸已是無幾，假使是八口之家。明春口糧就大然的成了問題，但爲了嫁女取媳，親友酬應，尤其借的糧或錢非還不可，於是非得拿這原已不够的口糧去應付不可，於是，就在泪前糧食已成問題的人家，也就很多的了，可是，社皮是不會說你一頓不喂飽的，家無餘糧，孩子張着嘴要吃呀，這情形，不容許你不再借貸了，今年借了糧，明年還時更多，他們永遠是吿貸渡日，永遠跌落在高利貸的深淵裏！就是自耕農吧，許多農戶收穀本來就不多，他們和佃農不同的就是沒有田主的催逼，然而他們比佃農多麻煩的，征實，征借，省縣級公糧，這都需要挑送實物的，任何捐稅多以田畝公攤，田越多，出捐越多，嫁娶死葬等事則和個農情形一樣，這一來，收糧原是够吃，而一切費用來源出於　米一途，也就爲了應急而弄得不够了，自然這又是和佃農命運相同，借貸呀，結果也照樣跌落在高利貸的深淵裏。　　今年鑒收猶是如此情形，倘遇水旱荒年，更不用談了，他們，可憐是年年高利貸，循環無蓋　然而，有誰憫憫他們呢？灣更有人專在他們身上打主意哩！　　省府禁攤派　鄉下捐偏多　　老實說，勝利後的安徽省政，是進步多了，在戰時，因爲需用繁浩，物價上漲，以政預算無法控制地方，各種攤派逐漸發生，但省方爲體念民力，曾　訂戰時人財物力各項征用無法，使攤派納入正規收支，勝利後，乃通令一律嚴止，並曾佈告週知，這原是省政當局愛民的苦心，站在老百姓的立塲。識然感激涕零！可是，據　行政人員又何嘗都能上　功令下念民艱呢？淸者自淸，但　者仍是自濁，天高皇帝遠，窮鄕僻壤中仍不免有許多人在向農民們伸手哩！　　規在的安徽？鄉鎭經費制度是「戶養保，保養鄕」，在整個國家經濟困難的今天，這種制度是無可非議的，官家保民治民，人民自有着官家的義務，而不肖的鄕保長就在這制度下多向人民開捐，這原不算什麼稀奇，鄕鎭人員待遇低，生活苦，老百姓似乎還有一種雅量原諒他們，事實上不原諒又怎樣呢？而使老百姓最要頭痛的，就是額外的攤派了！　　在鄉下，鄕長的威風是够嚇人的，他能代行警察權，拘大呀，鄕下人最怕的是拿將官裏去，鄕公的一道命令保甲長徵收什麼捐，豈有半個不字，就是皖中巢縣某一鄕，這兩個月來臨時捐稅可就够多了，正當的月米月捐，自然不談，臨時的有壯丁慰勞捐，鄕長因公進城旅費，鄕鎭民代表因公進城旅費，招待縣府派下來的某某「大員」，某次軍隊過境多少草米，鄉公所添購幾多用具，這些，都在鄕務會義上向各保擻派的，每一項就是三幾十萬元，最奇怪的是鄕鎭民代表三個人進城住了兩天回來開了四十五萬元的旅費，使老百姓詫異巢縣城內生活費用比上海還高，然而，錢總蹄是要出的，出遲了還會吃官司哩！　　記者接觸過好幾縣的鄕下人，都說今年政府徵集的壯丁，在徵集時人民花了錢，送騐體格時也花了錢，乃至交兵時也花了錢，記者迄今對此還認它是一個啞謎。　相逢長太息　都道生活難　　不論在什麼塲合，只要有兩個以上的農民，他們開始撩天以後，最初談些張家長李家短一些鄉曲瑣事，但自然地歸結到互道生活的艱難，那是幾定的話題。他們在談話中，雖然像一肚皮苦處無處訴吿，相互發洩一下，但他們只是太息而己，對國家對政府毫無怨尤，表示憤恨的則是共產軍鬧得老百姓在九年苦難後依然不得安寗，他們渴望安定，企望和平，是的，九年的對日抗戰，才竄得一朝勝利，農民們在陷敵期問，一切所難想像的苦痛，都親身嘗受過，而勝利後的今天，依然得不到溫暖，依然在痛苦中呻吟，又何怪他們太息？　　在高利貸稅捐層層重壓下，他們還受到物價波動的影響，以現在的物價和戰前比較，在皖中一帶算起來，多數不是農產物的成品，都是高漲了一萬倍，至少也在七千倍以上，而農民們唯一

<p>[衛生與医药每星期五出版P&gt;正常嬰兒之喂養法  陳銀河　　當嬰兒呱呱落地以後，首先當解決者，爲嬰兒之哺乳問題。然而哺乳以母親授乳呢？優乳母授乳呢？或用鮮牛乳及奶粉等代乳品呢？以上種種問題，欲求解決者，定不在少數。爲謀讀者解決以上問題，特分別將母　授乳，乳母授乳，及代乳品授乳之利弊，及授乳方法，概述於后。　　嬰兒之哺乳方法，可分爲天然哺乳法，人工哺乳法二種。所謂天然哺乳法者，以人乳由母親或乳母直接哺給嬰兒是也。人工哺乳法者，以獻乳或代乳品用器皿哺給是也。　　天然哺乳法　　（一）母乳哺嬰母乳爲嬰兒最適宜之天然營養品，嬰兒喂以母乳之利益，可分爲以下十項：　　（一）母乳爲乳類中最淸潔者，無傳染細菌之危險，又可不必消毒。毒。　　（二）母乳之溫度，最適合於嬰兒，絕無人工飲食之過熱與過凉之弊。　　（三）母乳爲最經濟與最方便之食物，不耗費又不多費時間，隨時　地可以哺嬰。　　（四）人乳所含蛋白質，多爲乳蛋白質，易於消化，脂肪小球較細，亦便於消化。且人乳內含少量鐵質，而牛乳則無，人乳內之維生素亦較牛乳爲多。　　（五）母乳之　分，始終與嬰兒胃口適合，初生至六七個月嬰兒之哺以母乳者，幾無營養缺乏之虞。且母乳之濃度，由稀而濃，適合嬰兒之胃口，乳母之乳，不能如是恰當。　　（六）母乳內含有免疫體，尤其在開始哺乳數日之稀乳內。凡母親之已患下列種種傳染病，如麻疹，猩紅熱，白喉等，嬰兒如喂以母乳者，在五六個月內對此類疾病有免疫性。　　（七）食母乳爲減低嬰兒死亡率之最好方法，且能預防及减少各種疾病之發生，尤其可防夏間之胃腸病，與冬日之呼吸病。　　（八）嬰兒食母乳，藉吮乳遝動之刀，能助長牙齒及下額骨發育之完全，除食母乳較人工哺乳多用力外，食母乳時必由暴孔呼吸，故鼻腔無塞閉之危險，以防腺樣增殖癥之發生　　（九）嬰兒之爲其母所乳者所得之愛護較週，其寒暖疾病無不立時發現，若委之於乳母，則乳母必不能愛之如已子，且乳母之教育何能及母親，因此嬰兒於無形中能得較優之教育。　　（十）乳兒之母其本身亦有極大利益，其子宮之攻縮較不乳兒者爲速，且其受孕較　，實可恢復身體健康與節制生育之一種方法。　　禁忌嬰兒哺以母乳之原因　　嬰兒當哺以母乳已如上述，然在特種情形之下母親白乳者，嬰孩與乳母俱能受相當之損害。　　（一）結核病，尤爲肺結核。　　（二）慢性病如心臟症，癌，進行性腎炎，與劇烈之虧血病等症。。急性病，急性傳染病，如夭花，白喉，猩紅熱等，可暫時停止哺乳，但按時當將乳汁擠出，病愈後可繼續哺乳。　　（四）乳腺之局部疾病，如乳腺炎及乳腺膿　，亦宜暫時停止哺乳。　　（五）特殊性疾病，如母親患劇烈性神經病，不能哺乳以防意外之危險。　　（六）產後之併發症，如產後流血過多，抽筋與產後敗血等。　　在缺乏母乳之時，嬰兒之營養間題，可採乳母以解決之。　　乳母之選擇　　乳母年齡以二十至三十爲最適宜，經產婦較初產婦爲善於育兒，乳母當以身體健壯，性情溫和，而無宿疾嗜好者爲合格。且須檢騐血液有無梅毒，有無結核症，有無痧眼，有無寄生蟲及腎炎或淋正。　　哺乳法產後十二小時內可不必喂乳，惟每隔兩小時當喂溫開水少許，十二小時後每四小時可哺乳一次，初三日內母乳未旺，但爲使乳汁暢旺與子宮之正常收縮起見。日間可在兩次哺乳之間，喂以溫開水。六個月後晚間僅喂一次，哺乳每次至多二十分鐘，哺一乳或二乳可視乳汁之多少而定，哺乳後輕輕拍背，使胃內所吸入之空氣外出，哺乳前後乳頭須用硼酸溶液洗凈。人乳不足時可添授牛乳等代乳品，或在每次喂哺人乳之後，補授牛乳數兩，或以牛乳完全代替人乳，每日一次或數次。補授或代授之牛乳量，視嬰兒年齡及人乳缺乏之程度而定。　　輔助食品嬰兒除乳汁外，須漸加下列各種食物：　　（一）嬰兒滿月後應喂以魚肝油，每日三次，每次半茶匙，過一二星期後，即應加至每次一茶匙，或用含丁種維生素之濃縮劑則更佳。　　（二）凡二月以上之嬰兒，每日應授以白菜水三次，每次兩湯匙，漸加至四湯匙。（橘汁與番茄汁，用水冲淡，皆可與白菜水通用）　　（三）自五六個月起，每日應授粥兩次，每次一湯匙，漸加至四湯匙。（如白米小米或麥片粥等均可通用）　　（四）自六七月起，每日須授靑菜泥兩次。（菠菜白菜或胡蘿葡等均可）　　（五）七八個月起，每日可加煮熟鷄蛋一個。　　（六）自九十個月起，每日可授煮熟水菓一次，並可加肝末，肉末，卵白等。　　斷乳　個月至十二月爲斷乳適當之期，嬰兒至一歲後，喂以母乳者，不但無益而且有害，並可使嬰兒得貧血或體格軟弱各症，因爲此時期之母乳，成分不足以供嬰兒身體發育之需要也。斷乳之法，須逐瀕舉行，自六個”後，哺乳次數宜開始遞减，每日一次，每以牛乳或乳粉代之，以後逐月减去，至遲至一歲，須完全停止母乳。　　人工喂養法　　此法在禁忌母親白乳，與用乳母成問題時方可使用。以牛乳或代乳品喂嬰兒，其宗旨須不違背人乳營養之原則，而以便利經濟　　爲要。乳類之通用於嬰兒者，除人乳外爲牛乳羊乳二種。牛乳有鮮牛乳，各種乳粉及改製牛乳之別。羊乳亦有鮮羊乳及乾粉之分。茲將各種乳類之成分及功用流弊略述於后：　　牛乳除人乳外爲嬰兒之惟一營養品。普通用者爲鮮牛乳，牛乳所含之蛋白質甚多，但不易消化之乳酪素（Casein）居十之八九，脂肪之小球較大，含水炭素較少，故調和牛乳往往加糖以補其不足，其所含之鈣寶甚多，嬰兒於一二月內喂以鮮牛乳者，須　以半量水，以後可不加。爲品一質與消毒完善，須採用可靠之牛乳廠出品。　　羊乳價値較康，目羊類無結核病，除脂防較多外其他與牛乳相似。其脂肪小球較牛乳爲小，易於消化，亦可採之爲人工哺乳品。　　罐裝之蒸發乳（EvaporatedMilk）市上出售之種類頗多，凡係可靠公司之出品，皆可採用，對於人工哺養法，其化學成分甚爲準確，用時加同量之水與百分之五至十分之糖，即成原乳，此類乳汁易於消化，但丙種維生素已失功用。　　純粹牛乳粉（Whole　Milkpowder）如克寗（Kli日）等，可靠之乳粉，均以淸潔之牛乳乾縮而成，其成分可靠，且消毒完着，製配乳液時，取乳粉一容量加水四容量，或乳粉一重量加水八重量，即成全乳。我國市售之乳粉種類極多，凡出於可靠公司而成分合格者，均可採用。　　其他如脫脂牛乳（Skinmed　Milk）蛋白乳（ProleinMilk）甜煉乳（Swectened　Concensed　Milk）酸牛乳（AcidMilk）及人乳化之牛乳（S.M.A.　＆　Sinilac）種類頗多，其售價較昂，目祗能用以矯正特稱情形，不適合一般健康嬰兒之生理。豆槳如以科學方法製成，用以喂養嬰兒，其成績亦尙佳，且其價廉於牛乳十倍，中下之家皆能應用　　嬰兒自初生至週歲，其所飲之乳量，可參考附表。　　日間在兩次哺乳間，須喂以溫開水。如用輔助食物，其法與人乳喂哺同，但如授以橘汁，則在第三星期起即可授之，因乳牛中丙種維生素甚爲缺乏，其他輔助品則可逐漸加入。　　總之正常嬰兒之喂養，以母乳爲最合宜，在特種情形下母親不能自乳者，當委諸適常之乳母，如用乳母成問題者，不得不採取人工哺乳法。人工哺乳可採用鮮牛乳或羊乳，或可靠公司所出之純粹乳粉及蒸發乳，家境淸寒者可採用科學製成之豆獎　　健康兒童初生至一歲每日飲乳量美國西部一農夫，誤吞刀片，經用愛克斯光檢驗，施以手術後，健康即告恢復本報特約紐約時報攝世界衛生機構（上）  喬樹民　　感恩節感國家恩，出國方知國籍珍。　　明日可會窺閭里？中原處處是啼痕！　　右爲作者感恩節放歌寄興之句。當東西兩大戰塲的人類瘋在屠殺行爲才告結束的今日，極目祖國，烽火瀰天，疫癘遍地，感　何如！和平是不可分割的，地面上有一處有烽火，全世界的和平受其威脅；，人類健康是息息相關的，地面上有一處有疫癘，全人類的健康　其影響。在此國際間鈎心鬥魚風雨如晦的局面之下，鷄鳴不已的一綫曙光，或　於由世界衛生機構的片斷合作而展爲全面和平合作的塲合。爰走筆介紹世界衛生機構的　義，以供國人之參考；亦所以說明我們仔肩上的責任，對於國家民族，對於世界人類，是多麼的沉重！　　當人類交通利器日益進步之際，世界的而積相對的縮小，所謂「天涯若比隣」，其所利便於文化交流經濟合　者，自不待言。但同時亦有一悲劇發生，即人類之疫癘，亦隨而增進其播散速率與範　是也。疾疫之有國際形者，　必賴國際間的合作，始克採取有效的防範。所以早期的國際衛生機構，莫不直接導源於防疫問題。最早如一八五一年巴黎國際會議之協議防範鼠疫與黃熱病，而有國際衛生法規之頒行；一八九二年維也納會議之協議防範霍亂而有蘇　士運河檢疫之協定；其後，一九〇二年有泛美衛生局之設立，一九〇七年有羅馬協定之公共衛生局之成立，一九二三年有國際聯盟衛生組之創設，一九二六年有南太平洋防疫情報局之組織，一九三三年有航空檢疫條例之訂定。凡此均以消極的防範的防疫工作爲動機，爲依歸。其以共同發展積極的進步的廣義的國際衛生爲目標者，實自此次「世界衛生機構」始，是不可以不紀。　　一九四六年之七月二十二日，實爲人類醫學衛生史上一最可珍貴之一日。是日也，聯合國之全體會員國五十一個國家代表（其時三個新會員國尚未加入），及十個非會員國的代表，在紐約一致無異議的共同　定了十節衛生機構（Worll　Health　Organization)，的組織法案。是爲全體聯合國合作之先聲，尤爲國際衛生組織之空前盛舉。其時筆者尙未來美，未獲躬逢其盛；但瀏實紀錄，追懷當日之熟烈情緒，實有不能已於言者。　　光是在一九四五年四月廿五日舊金山之第一次聯合國大會中，即已於聯合國憲章之第九第十雨章中，涉及「衛生」問題。願由我國及不魯塞爾之聯合建議，而有此次聯合國衛生會議之召集，而產生此偉大而又切實，廣博而又精細之世界衛生組織之傑作。大會係由美國衛生部長Thomas　Parran氏主席，我國首席代表沈克非氏亦爲副主席之一。現沈氏返國當有一番詳盡之報導。該組織法案共十九章八十二條，此間無席贅譯。但其精采之處，値得特別提出表彰申引，足供國人參考借鏡省惕努力者的有四義：醫壇新話新型藥物—抗組織胺藥物  紹　　抗組織胺藥物（Antihistaminic　Drugs）最近幾年出現的新型藥物。十多年以前法國傳諾民（Fourneau)的實驗室中首先製出一種編號929F的抗組織胺藥物，但因毒性甚强，並無實用價値。其後法人　　研究，製出Antergan與Neo　nyergan二藥，據稱毒性較低，適於臨床應用。最近美國方面急起直追，亦從事於此新型藥物之合與研究，已出三種，應用於臨床病例。此三種抗組織藥物爲Benadry，Pyrlbenzamine及Anthallan，　　這類藥物的特點。在其對抗組織胺（Histamine）的作用。無論在動物實　，或在臨床病例，均能對　　然則對抗組織胺的作用，究竟在監床上有何用處呢？　　在組織胺發現後不久，英國業理學泰斗Dale即於一九一〇年發表論著，創立過　性（Anaphylaxis）之組織被學說，認爲過敏性之發生乃因體內產州生組　胺所致，蓋組織胺之　理作用，與渦敏性之種種現象頗爲相似。其後同國循環系學種成Lewis氏主張組織內有旣成之組織胺或其相似物質，但與他物結合，而成不活動狀態。種種物理的化學的及免疫學的刺激能破壤此種結合，而釋出游離而活動性組織胺，遂產生過敏性及其他反應。此種學說業經英國學者多方加以實騐的證明。　　過敏性在臨床上又稱變能反應（Allergy），可致各種各式之疾病。急性而嚴重的有過敏性體克（Aeaphylactic　Shock）。較輕的有乾草熱（Hay　Fevur），哮喘（A.thma）及蕁蔴疹（Urticaria）等。此種種過敏性疾病之症狀，多由組織內釋出組織胺所致。如用抗組織胺藥物以對抗組織肢的　性作用，則種種症狀自可緩減甚或消失。　　但據目前監床實騐所見，此類藥物對於乾草熬與哮喘之撩效不著，恐因此種病例體內釋出之組織胺量太多，其作用不易完全抵消所致。然對蕁蔴疹，不諭急性與慢性，此類藥物均有類著之療效。近據MayoClinic之R.　A.　Q'Leary氏報告，除　蔴疹外,Bcnadryi對於皮硬症（Sdlerodorma）及指硬症（Acrosclerosis）亦多有效。　　雖然，此類藥物僅能對消旣釋出之少量組織　，並不能停止組織內組織胺之釋出，故雖奏效

<p>春秋仙人掌——旅滇小記之二  林詠春　　　　錄色的餅子，尖頂與根頂相連着，姿態有異同，如　倒頂，疊羅漢，更如橢圓形的手鏡。她在顧影嗎？她在點　唇嗎？她在理鬢畫眉嗎？　　餅上有針刺，如網；如少婦的盤髮；如碧綠的平湖，點滴着雨注。　　春天，茁壯的綠餅，生出一些頂端成凹形的小圖球，如酒杯。是等候甘露嗎？迎接甘露嗎？而量苦的鄕人，却摘取到城市裏，售賣在城市裏，在那長街呌賣的賣花天，聽說牠們竟被當做食品了，竟被那嗜酒的人，速酒杯都給吃了啊？　　蠻荒的地方多珍寶，但牠却不珍貴在蠻荒的地方了。你看：那屋瓦上，那土堤旁，那田頭……牠不擇土質地生長着。牠編成了圍牆，編成了荊棘的欄柵，牠與雜花野草同生息。　　你愛花的，侍花的，裝飾盆景，點綴你生活的園子的：都到這兒來啊，來擷取這綠色的餅子，來學習這晨妝的姿態啊！柴闊夫斯基底戀愛  李文勳　　偉大的俄羅斯音樂家柴關夫斯　底戀愛是甚饒趣味的，因爲他太窮困，由他底老師，著名的鋼琴家尼古烈絲·羅賓斯坦去代向一位有錢的富羅請求接濟，這位當孀名字呌做拉笛雅。馮麥克，是一位脾氣很古　的貴婦人，很固執，很矜持，但有一件東西却使她老人家招架不住——那便是音藥，音樂會使她廢寢忘食，如醉如痴，有時候使她輕快，有時候使她發抖，她嘆息着說：　　「這是一種什麼神奇的魔術使我整體爲之崩潰……」　　尼古烈絲帶着柴闊夫斯　底新作「暴風雨」去拜訪她，她老人家知通這位鋼琴家是「無事不上三寶殿」的，她微笑的望着他走近鋼琴旁邊，就很快的走了進去，這是她底老脾氣，喜歡單獨坐在一間屋子裏，在黑暗中靜靜的聆聽音樂……尼古烈絲開始了，用那富有魔術的手指開始了彈奏，一方神秘的國土在她眼前展開了。　　曲終人靜，拉笛雅響着啐啐的衣裙的聲音，她出現了。快樂的裏着氣！　　「是誰作的？」她幽幽然的問。　　「柴…闊…夫…斯基」尼古烈絲隆裏的回答：「這是一個天才」。　　「用不着你給他吹噓：他底　曲　够說明」！　　這個有了十一個子女的富孀開始和柴闊夫斯　底音樂戀愛起來了，她問他說：「在聽到你底『暴風雨』以後的幾天當中，我陷入了一種不能自主的，不幸的感情的海裏……」　　在這個時期裘的柴闊夫斯基，一方急切的需要錢幣，一方面也急切的盼望知己，而那個活得非常枯槁的富孀，也一樣需要一種心籃，需要一種活力。戀愛便這樣開始了。　　「彼得。伊里奇先生；你底仁慈的回信給了我好久以來就盼望的快樂……我請你把你底照片給我，如果你不願意，就乾脆拒絕我，不要加以解釋，解釋使我害怕……」　　「有一個時期，我很想　同你見面，現在呢，我愈愛　你，就愈不想同你見面了，　目前我寗願單獨享受甜蜜的　相思，在你底音樂中和你互　訴衷曲，你底音樂是我美好是的家鄕……」　「寄來的那幀照片收到了，　說不盡的謝謝，你底相片使我底世界和日子發出光輝，你允許再給我一幀新的，　是說不出的高興，我知道你不歡喜拍照，但你旣然決定再拍一張，就請你採取那同一的姿勢吧！把那雙深思的眼睛注視着我、因爲不是向我望着的男人都是一種驕倣，我不歡喜……」　　「昨天我歸自聖彼得堡，眞正不幸——沒有聽到你作的法古拉歌劇，我總要把這個損失設法瀰補起來，所以我請求你，彼得，給我寫一個曲子，這個曲子要聽得出悲哀和失望，甚至，如果你認爲合適，則還不妨可以聽出死的甜蜜的呼息……」　　但作爲一個眞誠的藝術家，却不能像廚司夫那樣一一按照食客底脾胃而燒出可口的菜餚，什麼東西都可以媽虎，不能媽虎的是對於藝術的忠貞信念，他說；　　「親愛的拉笛雅：使我很慚愧，每次來信都附有錢鈔，雖然一個藝術家從他底作品獲得酬報不算是羞辱，不過在你要我寫的那種樂曲當中，和別的創作無異，也一樣需要一種呌做「靈感」的覺悟，而這種東西，又不是一呼即至的，我不肯爲了金錢而作假，也不願利用我底技巧，把假的東西來冒充真的，但我需要金錢又是如此迫切……」　　「我現在正忙着寫作一個第四交　，我想把還是把這個曲子來獻給你……」柴闊夫斯　了三十七年的光棍，少年時代的輕浮習氣沒有了，不過却又陷人了另一一種不安的精神狀態，那也許是屬於生理這方面的，這原來就是一塊半富的田地，但現在却變得荒蕪了，正當這個時候，有一位懷春的少女呌做安東林娜的　入了道塊田地，她年輕而美貌，在熱的愛着柴關夫斯基……柴闊夫斯基用盡了心思，很委婉的把這個事情告訴了拉笛雅。　　「現在讓我來介紹我底未婚妻吧！她名字呌做安東林娜，伊芙娜分娜，米留柯芙，現年廿八歲容貌娟好，名譽尙佳，是一個能獨立自主的婦人，受過中等敎育，人也很大方的……」拉笛雅接到了這封信以後，立刻回信，一點沒有普通女人底那　酸氣，做一個大大方方的貴婦底身份和語氣，在這封信裏，她提出了他們將來通信的途徑，或叙個人生活，或專談音樂，……柴關夫斯　完全同意了，拉笛一雅不斷的寄錢給他，甚至寄結婚一的費用給他，在一八七七年的十月，拉笛雅一次寄了他六千個　布，這個巨大的數目對於柴闊夫斯　是是一種强心劑，他從此可以過安靜的生活，他底全力精力飽滿，全力充滿了音樂，拉笛雅寫信給他說：　　「我將給你錢，你可以放心寫作」　　柴柯斯　底聲名一天天隆盛，成了俄羅斯音樂界底權威，但在一八九〇年却意外的接到一封信，拉笛雅向他提議通信可以告一段落，沒有什麼理由的，柴關夫斯基大受震動幾乎要跌倒下去，他們始終未曾見面，他不得不走了，到美國去，經過巴黎舉行了一個音樂會，得到空前的成功，把這座傲慢的音樂城攻打了下來，但那但美好的愛情却永遠不再回來了。我與芭蕉  姚朋　　當夜深時分，一夢醒來，忽聽窗外細碎的雨滴，敵打着芭蕉葉的聲音，——那聲音旣繁民密，好像是慈母慇懃的可嚀，吩咐着「及早歸來」，又像是小兒女們的切切私語，急促的說「自已保重」，爲了因此而牽動起的離愁鄕思，我往往輾轉反側，悵然若有所失，終夜不能自解。　　然而，在北國的故鄉，却並沒有芭蕉……　　而我之對芭蕉的偏愛，好像遠始於還是一個很小的孩子的時候，最初究竟怎樣有了這麼一個先入爲主之見，現在實已不甚了了——從紛亂如絲的記憶中爬梳起來，我想起了故居呱父書房裏的一幅古畫。　　提起了那幅畫，不由就想起了那間精巧而陰　的書房，同時祖父的慈祥的面孔，馬上也從回憶裏出現。　　無論是誰，當你走進了那問古老的房子之後，在那溫軟的椅子上安坐片刻，面對着兩盆半放的臘梅，淸幽淡遠。案頭的小香爐喪，偶而也點燃着不知名的香，香味若有若無，淡藍色的烟圈兒裊裊飛升，似　似續，似乎將使你那飄飄然的空　玄想，有所寄託。從窗口接待了陽光，看庭中落華簫蕭，——「這裏原不是　書書的地方，只可供休憩而已」。呼吸着四周溫馨而靜謐的氣氛，只要喝一坏熱茶的時間，你也許就會覺得你不止看到了這星圭，而且也暸解了這房子的主人了　　正如很多老年人一樣，我的祖父也留着很長很長的　　，行動比較遲緩，不喜歡多說話，講究飲食，可一點兒也不注重穿着。——而我的祖父多少和別的老年人不火相同的，就是他並沒有那種與老年俱來的固執與偏見，他寗可使自已孤獨寂寞，決不迫使別人遵從他的意見，所以，害房裏就是他的小天地，同時，同時，在這小天地裏他是不希望有人來打擾淸思的。　　但是，因爲了過分的愛寵，我是常喜歡在書房裏消磨時光的，當然我旣不能　佩文韻府，也更不會欣賞三希堂法帖，可是，書桌上任我揮毫的紙筆已經給了我極大的誘惑，祖父所心愛的一付「雲子」，有黑有白，瑩然有光，也使我很爲「欣賞」；而最足以吸引我的，還是墻壁上常常更換的畫幅，和由於那些畫幅，引起了祖父講給我的許多故事。　　很費力地爬到書桌上，橄欖球一樣的木瓜，牛型的銅香爐，從耳朶鼻子裏冒着烟，刻着花紋的墨盒子，銅鎭尺甚麼的，這些個都玩贓了。甚至於連「給爺爺裝袋烟」，和「給爺爺理鬍子」也都覺得沒有意思時，往往就—　　「爺，您給我講笑話吧，上回不是還沒講完嗎？」　　墻上的畫是常常更換的，所以祖父的故事也常是新颕的，至今可以回想起，那些故事大半是取材自聊齋誌異之類的筆記中的。當然故事與畫是風馬牛不相及的，可是，當時能講那末多曲折婉轉的故事，在家裏是找不到另外的人了。　　我之第一次有了「芭蕉」的印象，也就是在祖父書房裏的一幅畫上，想來大概是甚麼仕女圖吧，一個穿淺絳衣服的少女的背影，後面是一株頗爲高大的芭蕉，綠而翠，葉子那麼寬闊，使我非常驚奇。　那一次的故事，事後我曾努力地試着回想過多少次，可惜總不得端倪，只恍惚記得說那芭蕉變了一個穿綠衣服的人，後來怎麼樣，就無論如何也想不起來了，——當然我現在也僅可以編造起來，但一想起那種糢糊的美的憶憬，我却情願保留着那一段大部殘缺了的故事，讓他永存在記憶裏！　　那之後，說不出爲甚麼，總是非常渴望能看一看一株價實的正在生長着的芭蕉，愈是求之不得，渴慕愈切，遂致使我成爲了一個芭蕉的偏愛者。　　眞的看見芭蕉，還不過是兩三年來的事；當時，敵熖正盛；我從北平動身偷渡過對銷綫的不久，河南前綫上國軍失利，我也倉皇西避，經關中，越秦嶺，輾轉入川跋山涉水，雖然歷盡辛苦，總算是實現了自已的顧望，在一個秋深木落，陰雨　綿的黃昏，我以一個朝拜聖地者的心情，掮着我那簡單而寒　的行囊，步上了山城的石級。　　環境對我是新奇而陌生，風俗旣大不同，語言又不能相通，熟人少到幾乎可說沒有，枯坐斗室中，日日爲自己的前途焦慮，也常爲現實的生活躊躇。　　就在這時候，我見到了芭蕉。　　客舍後面有一株，不高也不綠，遠不如想像中的美麗，但一見之下，竟好似認識了一位神交已久的朋友，心裏說不出的感動與快樂。以後，往往就白日閉門，獨處在重慶特有的竹笆房裏，打開窗子，早晨有濃霧，眺望長江浩淼，而芭蕉一株，迎風搖擺着手掌，恰似良朋在座，無論我在讀那織滿了悲怨的家信，或是寫着文章，一看到它，心頭便似得到了無限的慰安，解脫了靈魂上不少的傷感負担。　　記得那夜有客自故鄕來，冒着連下了半個月的　雨過訪，告訴了我「祖父病故」的噩耗，而那時抗戰正艱苦，情緒正極悲憤，突然遭逢這樣的意外，我實在感覺不克支持！　　而夜裏、一細雨敲着蕉葉，——這對我已決不是一種享受，他好像聲聲都適在我的心上，冷透了胸腔，敲碎了夢境。　　從那之後，我不敢再向芭蕉的錄蔭下獨坐，我不再數着日子盼望那新生的　業舒展開來，我更討厭那雨打芭蕉的繁囂而單調的聲音！　今年，離開四川，移居到這亦復多雨的江南，——然而却很少見芭蕉了，因此却又懷念着芭蕉。　　芭蕉，象徵着南方的充盈的熟情，奔放的活力，他不像松柏的古拙寒儉，也不像梅蘭的孤芳自賞，他以無所謂之心接待風雨，又把哀怨無所謂地送給世人！——我固然因聽到雨打芭蕉的聲音而落淚，可我的憂　也終於因此而得到了平抑。　　懷念着芭蕉，也懷念着千百里外並沒有芭蕉的故鄉，祖父已死，故居恐也蘯然無存，而那幅畫……梅鵲  孫多慈壁畫畫稿  喬托　　喬托（Giotto　1267-1337），原是一個平凡的牧童，自祁瑪保收他爲學生後，進步甚速，復與詩人但丁等交遊，不久就成爲一時名家。其作風嚴蕭而有生氣，五十八歲之後，停止繪畫，從事彫刻與建築。現存干佛羅朗斯的大理石的「喬托塔」，就是他晚年的作品。美術史家稱他爲「近代繪畫之鼻祖」，就是說意大利的文藝復興是由他開始的。這張素描畫稿，保存如許時間尙完整如新，尤爲難得。（獅）詩語  田肅　　詩有時候像一泓靜止的潭水，淸澈見底，有時候却像澎湃的浪濤；也有時候，像。一條狹狹的小溪，田，轉灣抹角，流肅過了嶙峋的怪石，，和芬芳的花草。生命的火  耶草天剛亮　　李壹堂便站在陰濕的泥地裏工作着了。　　拿此殘破的竹木，用着結連給的　蔴繼，　心的搭着茅棚，骨架紮好，慢慢的，在棚頂上舖起散亂的來徣。　　西北風，凜冽的，從遼闊的曠野一陣緊跟一陳的吹過來，李華堂口裏冒着白氣，鼻涕，口角的流水，在　鬧上結成了氷塊，他不斷的噓着那十指都已皺裂的數手。　　這是黃泛剛退落不久的平原，洪水冲刷過的區域，一片黃泥，週圍數十里不見草木和村莊。今年仲夏，黃河決堤時，李華堂一家三口，是給一隻救生船搶救到未被冲毀的土堤上的，他們在這堤上住了兩三個月。　　前些天，李華堂赤着脚在他住宅旁邊，步着失了界限的泥地，測量他應得的部分。然後拿鐵鍫劇了界限，但在界限以內，播起小麥的種子，撤下了他的希望，希望着明春來一個豐收。　　他工作着，在那衰老多紋的臉上，流露出一絲天賦的崛强的微笑。這塊地皮，是他祖先的遺產，房屋未被冲毀以前

<p>自由談昏燈碎語  少夫　　國都　　定度問題，南京北平之爭，昨天在國大憲草審查會中，以一一七票對六三票的多數，主張定都北平者獲勝了。　　這祇是憲草初步審查中如是規定，將來在綜合審查會中是否能通過，在全體大會中能否三　通過，現在還不敢有把握。　　然而就這樣的一種消息，已足夠刺激北平南京兩地了。大家想一想，這兩處的房地產將有怎樣的變化？　　金鈔　　黃金與美鈔，像難兄難弟，一動大家動。三四天前一個大浪潮，現在又來了一個浪潮。　　漲漲漲，照這樣趨勢下去，美金一元換法幣一萬元的日子不會太遠了。怎麽得了呀！　　有人說，因爲年關迫近，投機家想撈一票。這說法不一定完全正確，倘使金融市塲穩定，投機家又何能興風作浪呢？　　冬賑　　參議會潘議長出來大聲疾呼了。並且率先爲倡，將他的在參議會中的公費五十萬元捐出來，以作冬賑之用。　　這是測騐我們的天良，願大家樂施以救助這寒天中的大批窮苦無衣食的人們！新聞資料六三老太太　死後變男人  征凡　　報上載了一則奇聞：紐西闌有位年已六十三歲的老太太莫理夫人，最近在杜亞希維逝世後，忽然發現了「她」原來是一位道地的男子漢。這爲莫里先生，不但一生裝女，而且還曾經與一位男子結過婚。這樣的新聞，聽來也確乎覺得希奇古怪，　爲「聽」止。這位莫里先生的動機如何。電報上語焉不詳，無從考究，但是其生理上和心理上具有變態，則是毫無疑問，性心理上稱這類「男扮女」及「女扮男」的性變態爲「依盎癖」。　　不乏先例　　依盎是十八世紀法國的貴族子弟，在路易十五時代任職於法國外交界，最後死在倫敦，在倫敦時，大家都認爲他是女子，也是直到死了後在檢屍時方才發現他完全是男的。　　其實，這種依盎癖是很普遍的變態，只是大部分人把這種變態藏在心底深處，不大顯露罷了。普通，一個男人的「女性化」，走路時扭扭捏，怕羞，好虛榮心，敏感，這些現象都足以說明依盎癖的普遍性。女子渴望莫倣着男子們的脾氣和態度，喜穿男子的服裝，也是極普通的事。　　愈是文明的國家愈容易有這種事情。一般地說，且有依盎癖的男子或女子，在舉動生活方面往往失常得近乎瘋狂，男子妄想着懷孕，女子妄想着討老婆，但是在精神方面，他（她）們往往超出於常人以上，可能成爲傑出的藝術家，作家或政治家。　　性的變態　　這種變態心理，可能由父親或母親遺傳給他的兒女，輕微的呈現着神經過敏，或是具有一種失去平衡的氣質，顯著的變態只佔有極少的一部份人，所以像莫里一生裝女的事情，的確是難得遇見的。　　性心理上的變態，有時可以影響到生理，在生理構造及機能上有着變態的地方；例如男子的乳頭特別大，女子的喉頭特別發達，或者男子的聲音尖聲尖氣，而女子卻完全是男人聲音。單就生理上說，男女的變態也可能有。傳說上時常「一個女子睡覺中，覺得異樣，醒來已變了一個男人，」或是「一個男人生了一塲大病，病愈後忽然漸漸地變成了女子」。不過確確實實的事情，似乎還不大遇到。民國二十四年，有位淸縣女子姚錦屏，因　思父悲切，臥倒小樓中，昏迷狀態間，忽聞雷聲繞頂，一聲霹靂，居然在一刹那間，就此易釵而弁。來到上海，立刻轟動全市，各界往訪者戶限爲穿。結果由國立上海醫學院的醫生強迫檢騐，原來仍是女兒身，絕無變態。據說因想往新疆尋父，恐女性出遠門諸多不便，不得已而出此奇想。疑團大白，醫學家與新聞記者枉費了許多筆墨心血，真是滑稽之至　　可能的事　　當然，真正的女化男和男化女是可能有的，一九〇九年時，布雷教授找到在歷史上有五次發現。其道理不外乎腎上體膜的荷爾蒙起的作用，但詳細的內容迄今還是一個謎。　　「有目的」的裝扮，那是常常見到的了，就在上個月，靑島有個白俄少男，名呌菲利阿那富，偽裝舞女，居然下海伴舞，艷名喧傳，騙取美鈔不少，後被當地憲警識破，就此拆穿西洋鏡，被捕下獄。其他類似事件，很多很多，不在本文範圍以內恕不「旁證博引」了。　　我相信：心理學者與醫學家，在不久的將來會給我們更確切更滿意的答覆的。傳奇莫解之謎　姑妄聽之  岱之　　數年前，吾在英國潛艇C—23號當副艇長時，有一天奉命於天亮時馳出哈維茲港（Har　wich），從事於循例的巡哨海面的工作，這天剛遇着颶風，白浪如山，終日不息，到晚上更爲劇烈，C—23號以一艘不滿一千噸的潛艇，如一個瓶塞一般在波濤上進行着，直到第二天早上還沒有停止眹兆，全艇的人都困頓得不能再事支持了，於是艇長祇得下令將艇下潛，暫避風浪，以待天氣的好轉，在海底時，他關照吾說晚上十點鍾便要升出海面；特派一人看守前艙的時鍾，到時即行報告，其他的人可以休息，以復體力，於是各人在海底進了早餐後，都躺在舖上休息，不過各人都過於疲倦，不久便都憇睡了。　　不解之夢　　吾本來有一個妹子，在一家兵工廠裏服務，可是我卻從未到該廠去探望過她，這時候我恍惚覺得自己正在該廠的「入藥間」裏；那裏是一間廣大的屋子，許多女工正匆忙地把適量的炸藥放進砲彈的銅壳裏，我走出了「入藥間」不遠，便看見一間小辦公室，由敞開着的門望進去，見我的妹子正憑案而坐；案上還放了一個木牌，上面寫着「檢查員」字樣，可怪的是妹子明明看見了吾，卻絕不招呼；有時兩人目光相接，她也瞠然若無所睹，像是絕不知道我正站在門外似的，我十分驚疑，正躊躇間，忽然望見「入藥間」內火光熊熊，已經燒着地板了。吾嚇昏了，連忙大聲告警，可是任我怎樣力竭聲嘶地呌喊，竟沒一個人注意，回頭看我的妹子時，她已經伏在案上睡着了，這時候吾已經張惶失措，不知所爲，正想進去把妹子救出，但是還沒有舉步，已經被天崩地坼的爆炸聲，把吾從這個噩夢中驚醒了。　　醒來後，吾發覺自己還躺在潛艇里面狹僅容身的睡舖上，心臟還在瘋狂地跳着，回想剛才的夢境，不禁啞然失笑，自慶其夢而非真，否則此身已成嗇粉了，但是同時覺得頭痛欲裂，呼吸十分困難，看看手表，才知道已經十點，是應該升出海面的時候了，祇是全艇寂然，竟沒有一個醒的人，我支持着起來看，見那個奉命守着時鍾報告上升時間的人，竟也靠壁睡着了，當時心里有點火，正想把他搖醒，然後責其失職，不料方一搖動，他竟頹然仆於地上，和一個絕無生氣的屍體一般，吾這一嚇，真不下於剛才夢中所見「入藥間」失火，連忙跑去搖撼艇長，果然也毫無反應，知覺全失；摸摸他的心臟，脈膊已極微弱不絕如縷，至此於我知道事態已經萬分危急，全艇人的生命都操於我一個人手上，吾必須乘自己尚能支持之時，立刻把潛艇升出海面，然而這件工作很是複雜，決非一個人之力所能辦得到；於是否遍搖各人，盡力　他們的臉，用冷水澆他們的頭部，結果僥倖有三千人能夠于半意識狀態中支持而起，雖然這三個人已經失去了理智，而且昏迷地非扶着東西不能成步，然而我得了他們的幫助，加上自己的奮鬥，結果竟能把潛艇升出海面而脫奇險。　　安然無恙　　梯頂的鐵蓋門打開後，陽光和新鮮空氣同時射入，紅日當頭，時候已經晌午了，我們求得他船的援助，把昏迷中的艇員全數救醒了，原來我們沉於海底已歷二十四小時之久，至於起禍之因，則由於汽油箱裂縫洩氣，空氣給氣化的汽油混濁了，遂致全艇員兵，同時中毒，但是經過如此長久的時間，竟不致全體窒息而死，實在可以說有奇蹟了。　　在歸途中，我對各人述說我的怪夢及醒後經過情形，聞者無不譁然，說僥倖有這個怪夢，把我嚇醒，大家才能得救，否則若再過一二小時，則這數十人的生命是必死無疑的了。　　我們回到根據地，向司令部報告經過及辦完其他公事後，天已經晚了。我和艇長回到我們同住的公寓時，看見案上有電報和信各一封，都是我的妹子發來的，拆看時，電報說：「兄安否？函續詳」。看完竟不知所謂，及至看了信，才知道當日上午我的妹子在廠中工作時，忽覺神疲而伏案瞌睡，夢到C—23號潛艇中，見我和全艇員兵都僵臥着和死了一般。不過她心中似乎知道我還未喪命，便盡力搖撼，呼呌，但是終於無法使我醒了；正在徬徨無主的當兒，突然爲爆炸之聲所驚醒，原來該廠的「入藥間」已經失火炸毀了。此次事變，遭難而死者計女工三十六人，傷者達數百人之多，禍事發生於上午十時正，她本應於此時到「入藥間」執行檢查職務，而竟因瞌睡過時而倖免於難。她平時工作十分努力，而且體魄強健，絕無於工作時間瞌睡之理；乃當日到廠不久，即覺倦不能支而破例睡着，實出天意等語。我看完不覺愕然，把信遞給艇長看了，也爲之稱怪不置。這件事不久即傳遍當日海軍界，可是這樣怪的一個謎，誰是解人呢？（選譯自Blackwoods　Magazlne，原著者I，Scott。）「跑街」·「掮客」  陸士雄　　經濟學上兩大原則，「生產」與「分配」。即如工廠是生產者，商店是分配者，顧客是消費者，俗語所稱的「跑街」或「掮客」就是從生產者到分配者手裏的一個媒介，此種職業在英文稱爲Salesman或Broker。　　銷售職業在上海並不被人重視，因爲操此種職業的必須對人遷就，方可和氣生財。我們中國人往往不願降尊紆貴做這種面北的生意，但於英美諸邦不但重視銷售職業，並且是一種專門的學識。　　掮客謝絕　　在廣告中我們常常可以看到「掮客謝絕」的嚴格規定，或是跑街們在推銷某種貨物時打恭作揖以及燈紅酒綠下的應酬，使我國的銷售職業墜入深淵，不可自拔。所以比較新式管理的商業，往往不用跑街或掮客的名稱，改以「代表」Representative或「經紀人」Agent的職名。所謂代表或經紀人，其最後的目的仍然推銷某種貨物，不過他們事前經過相當的訓練，在學識上較勝一籌，來時多少帶些宣傳解釋的作用，他們的進行方式是採取長綫放紙鳶政策，並不限於閃，電式的成交。　　跑街或掮客的收入是佣金制，Commission（有人把這字譯作「伉蜜馨」又甜又香）俗語所謂「樹上開花」。在通常目光看來，他們是沒有固定的薪給，非爲一般人所願就。其實在美國此種佣金制是最優的職業，原因是收入無限，園地無限，並且自身是僱主，不是被人僱用。目前上海採用佣金制最普通的，即如保險經紀人，或藥廠跑街或代表等等，他如地產掮客，不成交則已，如有成交，在目前往往以條子計數，佣金可觀，從前此業中有句俗語：「三年做一件，一件吃三年」，就上面可以洞見交易的稀少和佣金收入的豐厚！　　甜酸苦辣　　筆者曾側身商塲多年，對於銷售方面的職業，雖未直接做過，但曾讀過幾本銷售學的書，並對於銷售職業者所嚐的甜酸苦辣種種經騐，曾耳濡目染，略知個中真相。有一位做銷售職業的友人，對我說過下面的譬仿，他說：他的職業可分三部曲：「神仙」，「老虎」，「狗」，當得着鉅額佣金時，快樂像神仙，正在追攬一筆生意時，像老虎一樣的猛勇直前，倘若逆境頻仍，久無佣金收入的話，則生活上狼狽得像狗一樣。上面的譬仿，雖然是鄙友個人的見解，卻可耐人尋味，我因對於銷售職業者即所謂跑街掮客，明其甘苦，所以遇到他們時，不但深致同情，並且在可能範圍內常是勉爲接受　。　　曾記得美國有一本Salesmanship的書，寫得非常好，學理經騐，兼羅並致，它於幾次再版後，在序文內說：美國有位銷售職業者，由於閱讀這本書，並依法泡製，前後賺得佣金二十萬美元。　　跑街與掮客，在通常稍有不同，跑街往往代表某一事業推銷出品，而掮客則以一筆一筆交易爲對象，比較好像臨性質，但都是靠銷售賺錢爲職業。我曾於一本美國銷售學書內看到一個很有趣的見解，大意說：世界上芸芸眾生脫不了「銷售」兩字的塲合，政治家發表　論談話，無非是銷售他的政　，男子對女子的求愛，是在銷售自己，工友們是銷售勞役和技術；智識份子是銷售思想與智力，　　畫家是銷售藝術等等。」所以各人方法雖有不同，而銷售的原則則爲一致，對於以正當方式從事於此種職業者，自然不應被輕視的！不敬師長  真諦　　經過了八年抗戰一切都變了，從前的小學教師到中學做教員，中學教員做了大學教授，差不多是常見到的，於是就不免「誤人子弟」了；學生也就難免「不敬師長」。　　記得我在初中時一位教國文的老先生，上課時咕嚕咕嚕，不知所云，學生都不能了解，背後總有點不好的批評，不知如何給他知道，上課時竟在黑板上寫着「誤人子弟，男盜女娼；不敬師長，絕子絕孫」。退課後一個同學罵道：「老鬼好刻毒，誤了人家子弟，只不過爲盜爲娼；不敬你師長，倒要誅滅到連後代都不給人家留一個！」欲罷不能  W·W　　從罷字上看，要四個纔能，不打不成相識，識相多來幾圈，和！誰不要和？不過各人打着各人的算盤，運籌帷幄，在此一算，怕人抬轎，憤而離席，別人怎會答應？欲罷不能，只好圈在裏面，但願連莊的做做好事。　　這是巴黎警察的新服裝，明年正月起用。三毛  張樂平上海橫斷面叫化子的組織14  黃嘉謨　　吃講茶　　老弟兄丐幫雖屬窮蹩無賴，但吃茶卻不能不吃。他們稱吃茶爲「上孟婆湯」，上茶樓爲「　孟婆亭」。但因字面過於累贅，現在都簡稱爲「孟婆」了。丐流自知出身低賤，究竟自漸形穢，不敢登大雅的茶樓。即普通的茶樓也夠不到。於是平日都相聚於專買開水的老虎灶上，泡一壺濁茶，蹲上長凳便坐上半天。可是此輩仍不能忘情於普通茶樓的高貴享受。呼爲「孟婆朝陽」。凡是較有身份有積蓄的丐流，能夠每天上「孟婆朝陽」去坐上幾個鍾頭，已是值得傲視懠輩，爲一般窮蹩的丐流所艷羨不置了。因爲能夠天天「上孟婆亭」，生活必已「樂會」（舒服）。或是身充「牌　」的爺叔輩，所業託交徒弟經營，自身坐享利益。在「孟婆」上消磨歲月，真不愧爲丐幫中的貴族階級呢。　　講茶評理　　丐幫中盛行着爭風鬥氣的風尚。尤以染有「白相人」習氣者糾紛最多。在無謂的糾紛難解時，雙方便招集黨羽，「上孟婆亭」去吃講茶評理。此種「孟婆」正如「鴻門宴無好宴」，自非平日爲享樂的喝茶可比。個中人稱爲「上孟婆攤一攤」。於是眾口紛紜，莫衷一是。唇槍舌戰，詬誶難聞。其爭點不外下列幾種。如詐得錢後分贓不均，或互爭「小鬼」各不相讓。或地盤「桶子」互相刦奪等。一言不合，談判破裂。接着便是雙方列陣，訴之武力了。　　丐幫請客　　如吃　　　後評理解決，勝訴的一方便提出了許多條件跟敗訴者爲難，至低限度也非請請客不可。借杯酒言歸於好，個中人稱爲「拉小買　子」。遂造成了丐幫請客的最高享受了。丐流雖屬貧困，但食色天性，幫中也有專營此種買賣的飯舖。他們平日向各大菜館搜羅一切剩皮剩骨，殘羮殘　，再經過一番盛碗裝盆的改裝手續。轉賣給一般窮苦的人。丐幫中的「拉小買　子」，也歸由此類飯舖承包。其每席定價在戰前時祇須一元至一元四角，居然冷盤熱炒大菜盆湯無一不備。儘夠丐流們的狼吞虎嚥。但因丐幫請客有時須拉　子至幾十席之多，非數十元莫辦。祇好約定遙遠的期限，以便從容籌款。至如丐頭新舊交替，或將優越地盤讓渡。也都得拉　子以事慶祝。甚至有借請客以打秋風，藉以敲同幫的財物的。真是黑幕重重，難以究結呢！</p>

<h3>The Constitutional Draft Review Concludes Tonight, General Assembly Scheduled for the 16th. The Convenor of the Comprehensive Committee Has Been Selected</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 11th] The National Assembly Presidium held its 16th meeting at 10:00 AM on the 12th, chaired by Zhang Qun, and resolved: (1) Each review committee will continue its work on the 12th and 13th, concluding on the evening of the 13th. (2) The convenor of the Comprehensive Committee will hold a meeting on the 13th. (3) The Comprehensive Committee will hold meetings at 3:00 PM on the 14th. (4) The General Assembly is rescheduled to the 16th. (5) Sun Ke, Chen Bai-ti, Wang Shijie, Xu Chuanlin, Chen Qitian, Xi Yushu, Kong Geng, He Hong, and eight other representatives were selected as convenors of the Comprehensive Committee.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 12th] Regarding the issue of the term of office for this session of the National Assembly representatives, it is rumored that an agreement has been reached that, under the principle of "mission accomplished but term not expired," it will be explicitly stipulated that "after the National Assembly concludes, the National Assembly representatives will be responsible for promoting political affairs, and their term of office will last until the closing day of the next National Assembly."</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 12th] Zuo Shunsheng answered questions related to the National Assembly at a reception held by the Central Propaganda Department on the 12th, as follows: Question: What are the views of the Youth Party on the draft constitution? Answer: The draft constitution proposed by the government was formed through consultation. Although the Youth Party's views are not included in the draft constitution, the Youth Party supports this draft constitution. Question: It is rumored that the Youth Party will participate in the reorganization of the government. Is this true? Answer: The principle of government reorganization has been determined, but the facts have not yet been concretized. If they are concretized, we will also consider whether to participate. Question: Article 1 of the draft constitution has been revised. What is your opinion? Answer: The passage of this article deviates from the original agreement. The Youth Party, of course, does not oppose the Three Principles of the People. The Youth Party will support the original proposal and does not agree to further revisions. It is not that every party cannot revise, but that certain important parties cannot revise. Question: Jiang Yuntian, the spokesperson for the Democratic Socialist Party, expressed his opinion on the draft constitution yesterday. What is your opinion? Answer: It is very good that the Democratic Socialist Party has adopted a reserved attitude and will express its opinions during the General Assembly. As for the original text of Jiang's speech, I have not yet seen it. Question: If the National Assembly passes the constitution, but the Youth Party does not agree, what will the Youth Party do? Answer: I believe that a draft constitution cannot satisfy every party on every article, so small disagreements are fine. Question: What are the Youth Party's thoughts on the rumored negotiations between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party? Answer: The Youth Party has always hoped for peace. It is always good to talk. If both parties need the Youth Party to participate, then the Youth Party will be happy to participate. Question: Why is Li Huang of the Youth Party not participating in the National Assembly? Answer: Li Huang's participation in the National Assembly was proposed at the same time as the list of other representatives of the Youth Party. At that time, Mr. Li did not express that he would not participate. Mr. Li has been elected as one of the members of the Presidium. The reason why Mr. Li is not coming now is due to his personal health issues, which have nothing to do with politics. Question: What are your opinions on ethnic issues and the opinions of the Mongolian compatriots who requested the implementation of a high degree of autonomy and the preservation of the league and banner system? Answer: I personally feel that the draft constitution originally stipulated that all ethnic groups are equal and that local autonomy is within the scope of autonomy, which I sympathize with very much. Regarding the league and banner system, I have learned that the government has no intention of changing it. As for a high degree of autonomy, I am not yet clear about its nature. Question: Luo Longji of the Democratic League gave a speech at Jinling University, saying that the draft constitution submitted by the government to the National Assembly is inconsistent with the Political Consultative Conference. What is your opinion? Answer: I have not yet seen the full text of the speech. The draft constitution must be revised, so of course there will be differences. There will still be differences when it is discussed and passed in the future. However, the Political Consultative Conference is not the final draft either. Its most important principle is that it is hoped that it will not be changed. Question: The prerequisite for the Communist Party to resume peace talks is to dissolve the National Assembly. What is your opinion? Answer: I have no opinion. Question: What is the Youth Party's opinion on the issue of the capital? Answer: We advocate that the location does not need to be specified. Question: Are there any points in the draft constitution that cannot be changed under any circumstances? Answer: (1) The powers of the National Assembly cannot be changed too much. (2) The Executive Yuan's responsibility to the Legislative Yuan cannot be modified. Question: What confidence do you have that the important principles in the draft constitution will be passed in the General Assembly? Answer: We are currently exchanging opinions with all parties. I believe that there will be no changes to the important principles.</p>
<h3>The First Review Committee Solemnly Discusses the Rights and Obligations of the People. The Article on the Personal Freedom of the People is Amended and Passed.</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 12th] The chapter on "The Rights and Obligations of the People," which is most closely related to the people, was solemnly discussed at the First Review Committee of the draft constitution on the 12th, both in the morning and afternoon. Representatives from the Youth Party, the Democratic Socialist Party, and other parties spoke very enthusiastically, carefully scrutinizing every word of the relevant rights and obligations. Article 8 of the original proposal, "Citizens of the Republic of China shall be equal before the law regardless of gender, religion, race, or party affiliation," was passed without objection. However, Article 9, which concerns the personal freedom of the people, was given special attention by all parties. Zhang Zhiben, Qin Liankui, Mou Zhendong, Ji etc., were recommended to revise it first. Later, in the meeting, there was a debate about whether the police agency has the power to detain and interrogate. Finally, the original proposal was amended as follows:</p>
<p>"The freedom of the people's person shall be guaranteed. Except for the arrest of criminals caught in the act, which shall be determined separately by law, no one may be arrested or detained by judicial or police agencies without due process of law. No one may be interrogated or punished by a court without due process of law. Any arrest, detention, interrogation, or punishment that does not follow due process of law may be refused.</p>
<p>When a person is arrested or detained on suspicion of a crime, the arresting or detaining agency shall notify the person and their designated friend of the reasons for the arrest or detention in writing, and transfer the person to the appropriate court for interrogation within 24 hours. The person or others may also request the official court to bring the arresting or detaining agency for trial within 24 hours. The court shall not refuse the aforementioned request and shall not first order the arresting or detaining agency to reply. The arresting or detaining agency shall not refuse or delay the court's order for trial.</p>
<p>When the people suffer any illegal arrest or detention, they or others may petition the court for investigation. The court shall not refuse and shall investigate the arresting or detaining agency within 24 hours and handle the matter in accordance with the law." Articles 10 to 20 were all maintained in their original form. Although some people advocated adding the phrase "shall not be restricted without law" to Articles 11 to 15, they were still passed in their original form. There was a slight debate about the freedom of religious belief, but it was still maintained in its original form. The only amendment was to Article 21. The original text of that article was "The people have the duty to serve in the military in accordance with the law." Now, the three characters "and labor service" have been added after military service. However, according to some representatives, this case is of great importance to the people, and someone may still raise objections in the General Assembly.</p>
<h3>The Second Review Committee Holds a Full-Day Meeting with No Results</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 12th] The Second Review Committee of the draft constitution held a plenary meeting all day on the 12th to discuss the revised opinions after sorting. The morning session was chaired by Wang Puhan. There was a fierce debate on whether ethnic minorities should separately elect National Assembly representatives. Finally, it was decided to submit this issue with a record to the Comprehensive Review Committee for resolution. The afternoon session was chaired by Hui Ji Kuan. Representatives enthusiastically spoke on the revised opinions of Article 27. One part advocated expanding the National Assembly's right to elect and recall to include the heads of the five branches of government, while another part advocated maintaining the original proposal, so that the state’s important power should be attributed to the National Assembly, and secondary and regular powers should be attributed to the Legislative Yuan for remediation, and the National Assembly cannot be permanently established. Various arguments were made, but however, to the 26th person who spoke, it was already six o'clock, and the crowd dispersed, and the all-day meeting had no results.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 12th] The Second Review Committee continued to meet at 3:00 PM on the afternoon of the 12th to review Article 27 of the draft constitution. When the provisions of the powers of the National Assembly were reviewed, Chen Qitian, a representative of the Youth Party, solemnly declared that yesterday afternoon, the Second Review Committee passed an article adding the National Assembly as the highest agency for the exercise of political power on behalf of the people within the National Assembly. The reason why the Youth Party did not speak at that time was to wait for the review of Article 27 to see how it would affect it, and then decide its attitude. Regarding the expansion of the National Assembly's powers, if it is based on the article added yesterday and greatly expands its powers, then the Youth Party will reserve the right to speak on this issue in the future General Assembly. He also said that the Youth Party believes that the following two items can be added to the powers of the National Assembly: (1) Changes in territory must be decided by the National Assembly. The National Assembly has the right to amend the constitution.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper Report] Sun Yi, a speaker of the Democratic Socialist Party, said on the evening of the 12th: Regarding the issue of the powers of the National Assembly, the attitude of the Democratic Socialist Party is extremely firm. Since the Preparatory Meeting of the National Assembly has decided that the National Assembly is the supreme agency of political power, it is very possible that the Democratic Socialist Party will withdraw from the National Assembly. Because the review opinions will be given considerable attention when the National Assembly reopens the plenary session.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 12th] Zhou Yisan, a representative of the Youth Party, announced at the First Review Committee on the afternoon of the 12th: "This delegate is ordered by the Youth Party delegation to make a simple statement, please record it.

<h3>The First Review Committee Heatedly Debates and the Proposal to Establish the Capital in Beiping is Passed. It Will Be Submitted to the Comprehensive Committee for Discussion Again.</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 12th] The dispute between establishing the capital in the north or south occurred in the First Review Committee of the draft constitution yesterday, after the preliminary battle. Today, the main forces contacted, and finally caused a big storm, which disturbed for nearly half an hour. Finally, it was submitted to a vote. Of the 192 people present, 117 people supported establishing the capital in Beiping, which exceeded half the number. Only 63 people supported establishing the capital in Nanjing. However, Liu Baimin, a representative from Nanjing, proposed that according to the decision of the Presidium, when the Review Committee encounters cases of unresolved disputes, they should be submitted to the Comprehensive Committee; please ask the Chairman to send this case to the Comprehensive Committee. According to Huang Shaogu, the convener, speaking to reporters afterwards, according to the decision of the Presidium, the results of the Review Committee's review, which are contrary to the original principles, should be sent to the Comprehensive Committee. Therefore, the case will still be discussed in the Comprehensive Committee. It is still uncertain whether the capital will be established in Beiping or the original proposal to maintain Nanjing as the capital.</p>
<p>This morning's First Review Committee was chaired by Xia Erkang of the Youth Party. Zhang Shan, a representative from Henan, explained his proposal to establish Lanzhou as the central capital, Nanjing as the eastern capital, and Shule as the western capital. Then, Song Dongdai, a representative from Shandong, under the enthusiastic applause of the northern representatives, spoke freely about the reasons for establishing the capital in Beiping. His words were: "Without the north, there is no China." To build a modern China, the capital must be established in Beiping. Establishing the capital in Nanjing is dangerous for the country. This kind of dream can be awakened"!</p>
<p>The Nanjing representatives were not willing to be outdone. Du Xinru spoke, expressing his admiration for the opinions of the northern representatives, and then returned to the topic. The safety of the country depends more on political facilities and national defense plans than on the capital. Even from the point of view of appeasing the hearts of the people, it is not necessarily necessary to establish the capital in Beiping.</p>
<p>At this point, Li He, a representative from Hebei, who had caused the storm, stood up to speak. Li first declared, "Brothers are young and vigorous, and there may be offenses." Those who were watching knew that a heated debate would be unavoidable. After Li explained that this matter was not a "north-south dispute," he refuted Liu Baimin's statement yesterday that "Nanjing is the revolutionary capital, the war of resistance capital, and the victory capital." He claimed that Premier Sun Yat-sen's revolution began in Guangzhou, so the real revolutionary capital should be Guangzhou. The war of resistance capital was not Nanjing, but Chongqing. Nanjing enjoyed the fruits of the revolution, and retreated first in the war of resistance, causing the traitor Wang Jingwei to establish a puppet capital in Nanjing. Therefore, he advocated establishing Nanjing as the "capital of national humiliation." As soon as this statement came out, the northern representatives applauded greatly, while the Nanjing representatives, because they were insulted too much, first Wang Yisheng stood up and pointed out. Nanjing, if it were the "capital of national humiliation", then why should the Chairman return the capital to Nanjing? Expressing strong dissatisfaction with its insulting capital, Jin Jiafei and others also questioned it. The local representatives did not wait for the speech to finish, and immediately stood up to confront each other. At the same time, more than 20 people spoke. The scene was noisy and chaotic, which was rare since the opening of the First Review Committee. Some representatives even stood on the high table of the council, dancing and gesticulating, with cups and paper flying. They insisted that Wang Yisheng must be severely punished. Although the conveners Huang Shaogu and Chen Yiyun shouted "Please maintain order" and bowed to all sides, asking the representatives to sit down, order was still difficult to maintain. After two or three minutes, the representatives settled down a little, and Chairman Xia Erkang suddenly announced "Please representatives who have not been allowed by the chairman to speak without authorization leave the meeting," and the situation became chaotic again. The Nanjing representatives asked according to what withdrawal order the representatives were to withdraw, and expressed that the entire body would leave, while the northern representatives firmly requested the chairman to carry out the decision he announced. After a stalemate, a "recess" sound came from the chairman's platform. Female representative Zhang Xiulan had a dispute with the chairman over a trivial matter, resulting in a quarrel. The bell, the sound of discussion, and the sounds of all sides were mixed together, and the order was extremely chaotic. One or two soldiers also watched at the door, so as to maintain order when necessary. Li He had stood up to speak at 10 o'clock. By this time, the clock was pointing to 10:20. The chaos had lasted for more than 20 minutes. The chairman then took emergency measures and asked the reporters present and people not related to the meeting to leave the meeting, and then submitted it to a vote. First, the proposals to establish the capital in Xi'an, Lanzhou, and Wuhan were voted on, and they all only received seven or eight votes. The reporters laughed in the next room. The vote on establishing the capital in Beiping was held. The sound of pulling chairs and leather shoes came from the meeting place, and everyone knew that those who stood up to support it must be in the minority. Then, I heard Liu Baimin, with his Zhejiang accent, urging the chairman to pay attention. Since there were opposing opinions on the case, please submit it to the Comprehensive Committee for review in accordance with the decision of the Presidium. After the voting ended, the reporters suddenly entered the room, and it was only then that they learned that those who supported establishing the capital in Beiping accounted for the majority (192 people were present, and 117 supported it). Only 63 votes supported establishing the capital in Nanjing, and only 67 votes supported not stipulating it in the constitution. The northern representatives were very satisfied, while Jiang Zhengqing and other representatives from Nanjing solemnly declared their right to speak at the General Assembly at the chairman's platform. Vocational representative He Yuanming had submitted a note to the chairman at 9:30, asking him to suspend the review and submit the case to the Comprehensive Committee. The chairman failed to pay attention, which caused a great disturbance. He especially questioned the chairman and expressed his deep regret. At 10:45, they continued to discuss Chapter 2. The Nanjing representatives left in turn, and the meeting place was very quiet after the great storm. Only some representatives discussed the issue of "personal freedom" in a slow and methodical tone. Although this matter is of great importance to the people, it no longer attracted general attention.</p>
<h3>The Executive Yuan is Responsible to the Legislative Yuan. The Third Review Committee Submits it to a Group for Sorting.</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 12th] The Third Review Committee was held at 9:00 AM this morning, chaired by Jiang Yuntian, to continue discussing Article 58, the article on the Executive Yuan's responsibility to the Legislative Yuan.

The representatives had many opinions. The Chairman sought everyone's opinion. After a five-minute break, Wang Chong'e, Wang Shijie. Li Junlong, Sun Yafu, Zhang Weihan, etc., put forward their opinions, believing that a sorting group could be formed to sort it out first, and then submit the sorting opinions to the General Assembly for discussion, which would be simpler and easier to implement. After passing it, they proceeded to vote for seven people as sorters. The meeting will continue in the afternoon, and the sorting group is scheduled to be held at 4:00.</p>

The plenary session continued to review the following cases. Article 59 was changed to "The Executive Yuan meeting shall be organized by the President, Vice President, heads of various ministries and commissions, and ministers without portfolio of the Executive Yuan, with the President as the chairman. (The original text does not have this item) The President of the Executive Yuan and the heads of various ministries and commissions shall submit the bills, budget bills, martial law orders, declarations of war (originally amnesty bills), peace negotiation bills, treaty bills, and other important matters, or matters involving the common interests of ministries and commissions, to the Executive Yuan meeting for deliberation."</p>

Article 64 was passed in its original form. The provisions of Article 65 on the distribution of seats for legislators aroused fierce debate again. The discussion was stopped halfway through.</p>
<p>The amended draft of Article 58, which was drafted by the sorting group for two hours, added "The Executive Yuan shall report to the Legislative Yuan on its administrative policies and plans" and amended the cases of reconsideration by the Legislative Yuan. Two-thirds of the legislators present are two-thirds of all legislators to determine the number of people. The meeting adjourned at 6:00 PM and decided to submit various opinions on Article 65 to the conveners for sorting and presentation at the meeting on the 13th.</p>

<h3>The Government's Dispatch of Personnel to Yan'an Has Not Yet Been Specifically Decided. We Are Determined to Abide by the Treaty on the Dalian Issue.</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 12th] The Central Propaganda Department's press conference for Chinese and foreign reporters was held at 2:00 PM on the 12th, hosted by Minister Peng Xuepei and Director Ye Gongchao. The main Q&amp;A is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Question: Does the government have any plans to reopen peace talks? For this purpose, what measures does the government have now? Who will represent the government to Yan'an, Zhang Qun or Deng Lizhi?</p>
<p>Minister Peng replied: The government intends to send someone to Yan'an, but there are no specific decisions at present.</p>
<p>Question: The CCP has clearly stated, "Dissolving the National Assembly and restoring the military position on January 13" as the basis for resuming negotiations. Now the government declares its intention to resume peace talks and will send senior officials to Yan'an for negotiations. Does the government intend to consider these points, or does the government have another basis for negotiations?</p>
<p>Minister Peng replied: The two points raised by the CCP have been considered impossible by various Chinese and foreign newspapers, so I don't need to add any more comments. As for the other points, no decision has been made yet.</p>
<p>Question: Are there any large-scale battles in the Northeast? Or will they happen soon? Or have they happened elsewhere? In the conflicts in the Yan'an border area, what actions did each side take against the other?</p>
<p>Minister Peng replied: There are no large-scale battles in the Northeast or any other places. It is reported that the CCP is preparing for a so-called winter offensive in the Northeast and has concentrated a large number of troops with poor equipment and training in the northeast and northwest of Changchun, but there is no action at present. The Yan'an border area is still peaceful except for occasional small conflicts. The government has warned the CCP not to attack Yulin, so as not to extend to Yan'an. There is nothing happening at present. The CCP's propaganda that the government abandoned the border area of Baotou is also not true, because the troops stationed in those areas have been stationed there for a long time.</p>
<p>Question: Have China and the Soviet Union negotiated on the issue of receiving Dalian?</p>
<p>Director Ye replied: Regarding the issue of Dalian, the Chinese government has not conducted negotiations with the Soviet side. In our opinion, the status of Dalian has been clearly stipulated in the Sino-Soviet Treaty, and there is no need for any coordination. The Chinese government is determined to strictly abide by and implement the provisions of the Sino-Soviet Treaty.</p>
<p>Question: What is the truth about the so-called Sino-Soviet Andong Agreement?</p>
<p>Director Ye replied: The Chinese authorities in Andong have been ordered to pay attention so that the Soviet military outposts on the Korean border will no longer extend into our national borders. This matter is being negotiated with the local Soviet military.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 12th] Since refusing to participate in the National Assembly, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has been implementing general mobilization in full swing, hoping to launch a long-term rebellion.

<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 12th] Military News: After the government issued the third ceasefire order on November 13th, the communist forces, taking advantage of the National Army's compliance with the ceasefire, launched large-scale offensives against National Army troops in various regions. In Shandong Province, they captured Pingdu, Changyi, Shouguang, Qidong, and other places. In Shanxi Province, they captured Xi County, Yonghe, Daning, and other counties, as well as Fenxi, Huairen, and countless villages and towns. They also launched fierce attacks on Zhongyang City with poison gas. In the Northeast, they have massed large armies, threatening Changchun. Recently, they have been taking advantage of the freezing of the Songhua River to cross the river and attack National Army troops in Chalukou and other places. Furthermore, from November 11th to 27th, the communist forces carried out large-scale destruction of transportation, causing significant damage to the Pinghan, Beining, and Jinpu railways.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 12th] It is reported that fierce fighting has been taking place southwest of the city on the 12th. National Army troops are braving heavy communist artillery fire to prevent the communist forces from advancing south. Furthermore, the communist forces at the Huoduo Township, sixty li west of Yancheng, launched a two-pronged attack at 2:30 PM today. One force attacked Longgang, attempting to intercept the rear of the National Army vehicles west of Yancheng. The other force raided westward, attempting to disrupt Xianfeng, which belongs to Fei County again. National Army troops are dividing their forces to intercept the enemy.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 12th] The reports of the recovery of Yancheng have not yet been officially confirmed. According to reliable sources, National Army troops did enter the south gate of the county town once, and fighting is currently still taking place in the southeastern suburbs. According to aerial reconnaissance reports, communist forces in Yancheng set fires in the city yesterday, with about a dozen locations ablaze. It was also discovered that several thousand communist forces were gathering from Yancheng towards the Funing area.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Xuzhou, 11th] High-ranking communist generals in Shandong Province recently held a secret meeting and, once arrangements are completed, will launch a large-scale offensive. Currently, communist forces numbering 200,000 have gathered on both sides of the Jiaoji Railway, including 2,000 local militia. Communist forces from southern Hebei are advancing towards northern Shandong.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Xuzhou, 12th] Communist forces in northern Jiangsu held a military and political conference at Wangjiaye in Shuyang on the 4th, lasting six days.

<p>Sun Lianzhong Discusses the Current Situation: Communist Forces are Not Enough to Threaten Baoding</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 12th] Sun Lianzhong, Commander of the 11th War Area, met with reporters this morning and spoke freely about the current situation in the war zone, stating that the main task at present is to restore and protect transportation. Stability in the north is a matter of time, but it cannot be rushed. The recent tense situation in Hebei Province is due to the communist forces losing Rehe and Chahar. Hebei Province has grain and money, and the communist forces are attempting to use this to grow stronger. Under these circumstances, sporadic railway destruction is inevitable. The National Army cannot post guards every three steps or five steps. Although communist forces have been continuously reinforcing the periphery of Baoding in recent days, they are not enough to threaten the security of Baoding. The Ping-Bao railway will be open to traffic again in one week, while the Bao-Shi railway cannot be repaired in two or three weeks due to a lack of railway materials. Sun also stated that there are currently three battlefields in Hebei Province: one in the northern section of the Pinghan Railway, one in eastern Hebei, and one in the northern section of the Jinpu Railway. For the convenience of command, the headquarters of the 11th War Area has divided Hebei Province into two major command zones, with the northern section of the Jinpu Railway and eastern Hebei under the command of Deputy Commander Shangguan Yunxiang, and the Pinggu Line and the northern section of the Pinghan Line under the command of Chen Lancheng. Sun himself will travel back and forth between Ping and Bao from now on.</p>

<h3>The Huayuankou Blocking Bureau Sabotage Case</h3>
<p>Confirmed to be the Work of Communist Forces</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Zhengzhou, 12th] On the night of the 9th, the stone quarrying site of the Huayuankou Blocking Bureau at Luwangfen, north of Xinxiang, was sabotaged by armed rioters. A preliminary investigation has confirmed that it was the work of the 49th Regiment of the communist forces. The regiment is specifically responsible for sabotage missions and has attempted to blow up the Yellow River Railway Bridge. Three stone-crushing machines, over ten vehicles, over ninety large barrels of gasoline, and a batch of relief supplies were destroyed at Luwangfen. Several self-defense soldiers guarding the site were wounded, and nine technicians were captured. The Blocking Bureau is currently working day and night to provide the urgently needed stone materials, and this robbery has significantly affected the progress of the project.</p>

<h3>Differences Between China and the Philippines Have Been Eliminated; Friendship Treaty Will Be Signed; Overseas Chinese in the Philippines Can Establish Their Own Marketplaces</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Manila, 12th] Chen Zhiping, our Minister to the Philippines, who returned here on the evening of the 9th, held talks with Philippine Vice President and Foreign Minister Quirino on amending the draft Sino-Philippine Friendship Treaty for an hour. Well-informed sources say that all differences between China and the Philippines on the treaty have been eliminated, and the treaty can be signed soon. Chen also discussed the hawker problem with Quirino. Chen believes that our overseas Chinese have been trading as hawkers here for a hundred years and have made great contributions to the commercial marketplace. It is unfair for the Philippines to deprive them of their livelihood now. Quirino replied that according to the regulations promulgated in accordance with Article 37 of the Philippine Republic Act, Chinese hawkers are not allowed to operate in public markets, but they may be allowed to set up their own marketplaces. This allays the concerns of the overseas Chinese community here that the Philippine government will not allow them to set up their own marketplaces. Chen invited personnel from the overseas Chinese Chamber of Commerce responsible for hawker affairs to a meeting at our consulate at 10:00 AM today.</p>
<h3>Ding Mocun Tried for the Second Time; The Court Continues to Investigate Evidence of Crimes; The "Devil King" Knows His Deceitful Plans Are Difficult to Sell</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 12th] Ding Mocun, the "Seventy-Six" murderous devil, was tried again at the Capital High Court on the 12th. At 10:40 AM, Presiding Judge Jin Shiding, along with Judges Ge Zhaotang and Shentu Chen, and Prosecutor He Zhongjin, convened a collegiate panel in the Dacheng Hall to continue to thoroughly investigate the charges and evidence against him.

<p>The scene in court today was far from what it used to be, with less than 200 spectators. Ding's cunning and treachery were far less than in the previous trial. When answering questions, he often looked back at his defense lawyers Wang Long and Xue Songqi. When mentioning the case of Miss Zheng Pingru's murder, he was not as animated as he had been in the previous trial. The court's investigation and interrogation of the evidence were extremely thorough and rigorous, and he knew that his deceitful plans could no longer be sold.</p>
<p>The morning session adjourned at 12:00 PM for rest, and the afternoon session continued at 2:15 PM until 4:10 PM, when it ended. The court ordered a postponement for a retrial, and Ding was returned to detention in the cold wind.</p>

<h3>The New York Foreign Ministers' Conference Concludes Successfully</h3>
<p>The New York Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference concluded successfully yesterday. Not only did it complete its scheduled task of passing the draft treaties with Italy, Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Finland that had been approved by the Paris Peace Conference, and decided to sign them in Paris on February 10th next year, but it also made a further resolution: the next Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference is scheduled to be held in Moscow on March 10th next year to discuss the draft treaties with Germany and Austria. This must be said to be a major achievement of this Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference.</p>
<p>Throughout the year 1946, the politicians and diplomats of various countries convened countless international conferences to clean up the aftermath of the war and create world peace. Starting with the first session of the United Nations General Assembly in London in January of this year, two Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conferences were successively held in Paris, which enabled the Twenty-One Nation Peace Conference to open in Paris. Afterwards, the second session of the United Nations General Assembly was held in New York, and the Four Foreign Ministers also conveniently met in New York. During this period, politicians and diplomats from various countries worked tirelessly, traveling between London, Paris, and New York. The only aspiration in their hearts was how to lay a solid foundation for world peace. Therefore, in each international conference, they did not hesitate to use any words and tried their best to state their opinions. Although waves were caused repeatedly, the conscience of mankind's love for peace after the war finally overcame all obstacles and negotiated a compromise on the most thorny international problems it faced, so that 1946 could still achieve a peaceful ending. Therefore, we cannot but express considerable satisfaction with the successful conclusion of the New York Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference, and recognize it as the most powerful guarantee for the successful creation of world peace.</p>
<p>Since the Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference discussed the draft treaties with Italy, Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Finland and reached an agreement, the international community has been filled with an optimistic atmosphere, unfolding a beautiful prospect. The French political circles first expressed satisfaction, and the Soviet political commentator Zhukov published an article in "Pravda," emphasizing the achievements of the Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference and saying in an optimistic tone: "From the success of the Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference, we can see that the cooperation of the four powers is still possible." This sentence really contains a very profound meaning and is worthy of our deep thought. Because since the end of World War II, the international situation has been changing rapidly, sometimes "at the end of the mountains and rivers," thinking there is no way to go; but sometimes, it is "the willow is dark, the flowers are bright," feeling that the future is bright and there is much to be done. Such uncertainty really makes people who love peace feel annoyed, especially China, which hopes for international peace, is closely watching the evolution of the international situation at all times and day and night is looking forward to the international situation being able to clear up as soon as possible. The rising and falling waves of success often make us uneasy; but now the conscience of mankind has finally broken through the international clouds. In the United Nations General Assembly's discussion of the two major problems of investigating troops and reducing armaments, the opinions of various countries were originally divided and their views were different, no less than running in opposite directions; but after the compromise and compromise of politicians and diplomats of various countries, the opinions of China, Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union finally converged and established nine principles. Also, when the Four Foreign Ministers were discussing the most thorny issue of the Port of Trieste, the conflicts of interest of various countries seemed to have no room for compromise; but in the end, an agreement was reached. The representatives of the great powers all embraced the spirit of mutual trust and mutual concession, "nothing cannot be discussed, no problem cannot be solved," which really makes us have infinite hope for the future of world peace.</p>
<p>According to the analysis of the British Liberal Daily Manchester Guardian, the recent improvement in the international situation is due to a major shift in Soviet policy; the newspaper also called on politicians and diplomats of Western countries to use this rare opportunity to make good use of their wisdom and seek thorough cooperation with the Soviet Union. The editorial of this newspaper has repeatedly hoped that the post-war world will not be divided into two worlds, otherwise there will be no peace to speak of. The international progress in the past two weeks is really the starting point of a turning point in the era. The endless undercurrents in the international community for a year can be eliminated from now on. According to the Soviet Pravda, the increase in the production of some Soviet industries is still below the level of the government's budget plan, from which we can also know the difficult situation of the Soviet economy. Politicians and diplomats of Western countries should broaden their horizons, focus on the big picture, and ensure that the Soviet Union is enlightened and firmly believes that if the Soviet Union can cooperate with Western countries, it will be more beneficial than confronting them. Only in this way can the beautiful prospects before us be realized.</p>
<p>Finally, there is one more point that we have to point out, that is, our country naturally also deeply approves of the next Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference being held in Moscow to discuss the draft treaties with Germany and Austria; however, according to the Potsdam Declaration, China is also a member of the Foreign Ministers' Conference and should have the right to request to participate in the Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference and jointly discuss the treaty with Germany. The four countries of Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union have no reason to refuse; however, after US Secretary of State Byrnes put forward the request of our Foreign Minister Wang, it was opposed by Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, which we cannot but express regret about. At the same time, we also want to say a word to the four powers: if the current harmony among the great powers cannot expand its foundation, then even though the prospects before us are extremely beautiful, we are still afraid that it will be difficult to realize. Therefore, at this moment, we still cannot be too optimistic!</p>
<h3>Professor Pound Discusses the Chinese Constitution</h3>
<p>[American Boston News] Professor Pound of Harvard University, a world authority on law, recently published a lengthy essay of over 20,000 words. He discussed in detail the basic principles that China should pay attention to in its future constitution-making process. He used historical and comparative methods, as well as the perspectives of Sociological jurisprudence and Pragmatic philosophy, which has attracted considerable attention from Americans. A summary of its main points is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) China needs a Chinese constitution with Chinese characteristics that conforms to Chinese national conditions, without copying foreign ones.</p>
<p>The most important point to pay attention to when formulating a constitution is to ensure that the content of the constitution matches a country's historical and cultural background and social environment. Constitutional politics is not something that can be created in a short period of time based solely on ideals. A constitutional government must gradually form and develop from a country's original cultural relics system and traditional ideals. It is by no means something that can be arbitrarily moved from one country to another after it is completed. Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the creator of the Republic of China, saw this, so he advocated giving the Chinese people a transitional period in order to make considerable preparations for the implementation of constitutional government. The draft constitution announced in 1936 (Editor's note: the May 5th Draft Constitution) was drafted based on this plan. The draft constitution was drafted for the Chinese people based on China's historical and cultural background and social conditions, not for the people of Western Europe or the Americas, or for the residents of a utopian ideal.</p>
<p>Before and after the French Revolution, the constitution was repeatedly changed, and a new constitution was revised again in 1946. France adopted three constitutions in the ten years of the late 18th century, six constitutions in the 19th century, and today, before half of the 20th century has passed, it has adopted another new constitution. In total, France has adopted ten constitutions in 157 years.</p>
<p>The situation in the United States is the opposite. The United States has never changed its constitution since the establishment of the federal government. During the Civil War, the constitution was only amended three times, but the general organization of the government was not affected. As the great British politician and thinker Bryce said:</p>
<p>"Anything that makes people obey and respect must have a deeper foundation in the past: the slower the emergence and development of a system, the longer its life is likely to be; the American Constitution is no exception."</p>
<p>The situation after the American Revolution is quite similar to the situation in China today after eight years of the War of Resistance Against Japan. At that time, the American economy suffered serious damage, as is the case in China today. When the United States formulated its constitution, it preserved the inherent system as much as possible, so its constitution was able to adapt to the national conditions. When France formulated its constitution that year, it was overly influenced by the abstract ideas popular in the 17th and 18th centuries, and failed to consider its own historical background and social conditions. Therefore, although it repeatedly changed its constitution, the political situation could not be stabilized. China's constitution-making today should not simply copy the systems of Western countries.</p>
<p>The value of a constitution cannot be judged solely by the provisions on paper. Today, there are some countries that are merely democracies on paper. Several republics in Central and South America and several new countries in southeastern Europe are clear examples. The way these countries make constitutions is not a good example. In these countries, the general public does not actually know or have the opportunity to learn how to politically exercise the right to participate in politics granted to them by the constitution.</p>
<p>Some people believe that by carefully studying the constitutions of European and American countries in the past and present, an ideal constitution that can be universally applied to all countries in the world can be discovered. The error of this view is actually equivalent to the superstition that an ideal civil and criminal code that can be universally applied to all countries in the world can be formulated. Human experience is actually the opposite.</p>
<p>The formulation of a constitution must take into account the needs of time, region, and people. What China needs is a constitution with Chinese characteristics that suits Chinese conditions, not a constitution copied from foreign countries. The draft constitution of 1936 paid attention to this point and was more manageable. British scholar Bryce said: "What matters is the facts, not the names." No one can understand the Chinese environment as truly as the Chinese themselves. Only the Chinese themselves can use their talents to formulate a lasting constitution for China. I have observed many people serving the public in China today. My observations are enough to make me trust their ability, sincerity, and wisdom. Therefore, I dare to say to them in a frank tone: "You should trust yourselves, and you should promote the current task based on your own insights and understanding."</p>
<p>(2) The separation of powers is not a necessary condition for democracy or constitutional politics.</p>
<p>The separation of powers was originally a theory created by the Greek scholar Aristotle. At that time, there was no factual basis, because there was no so-called separation of powers in Greece at that time.</p>
<p>Although Britain gradually separated powers in the 17th century, it did not reach the extent described by the French jurist Montesquieu. In fact, all power in Britain is concentrated in Parliament, which is far from the separation of powers. The United States has encountered various difficulties in implementing the separation of powers, because politics and law are practical matters and the political power of a country cannot be divided entirely by logic.</p>
<p>The separation of powers is not a necessary condition for constitutional or democratic politics. The general public believes that this system is an ideal system that can be universally applied to all countries in the world, which inevitably ignores the special historical and social background from which this system originated. No one can argue that the separation of powers is the only system that guarantees freedom, is suitable for constitutional politics, or meets democratic ideals.</p>
<p>Democracy has nominal democracy and substantive democracy. There are many examples of nominal democracy in the world. We should strive for the realization of substantive democracy, and not stick to the name. There are different forms of democracy, so the distribution of power cannot be generalized.</p>
<p>Monarchy has autocracy and constitutionalism, and democracy also has autocracy and constitutionalism. In countries where the people's level of knowledge is low and political training is insufficient, the opinions of the majority are not necessarily desirable, and the public may not be enthusiastic about state affairs. As a result, the democratic politics of the majority is nothing more than the autocratic politics of a few bureaucrats and politicians. Moreover, the provisions of the constitution can restrict officials, but not necessarily the entire or majority of people in a country where sovereignty lies. If the people's education level is insufficient, the purpose expected by the constitution may not be realized.</p>
<p>Modern countries have transformed from power states aimed at exercising ruling power to "service states" aimed at serving the people. The scope of administrative activities is gradually expanding, and its importance is also increasing, so administrative power should not be excessively restricted.</p>
<p>What China urgently needs in administration today is unity, continuity, stability, and improved effectiveness. Since China lacks the historical and social background of the United States in those years, there is no need to adopt the three-power system, and the three-power system may not be suitable for China's urgent political needs today.</p>
<p>(3) Should China adopt a responsible cabinet system, a presidential system, or other systems?</p>
<p>Constitutional discussants often believe that modern countries must adopt either a responsible cabinet system or a presidential system. In fact, the government organization of democratic countries does not necessarily have to imitate either of the two. The most dynamic democratic countries in the nineteenth century were Britain and the United States, and their systems should be adopted by most other countries. Although the responsible cabinet system of Britain is widely popular, its performance in other countries is not satisfactory. The advantages of this system depend on the opinions of ten people: (1) It can enable the people's will to quickly and fully take effect; (2) It can enable the majority of the administrative department and the legislative body to cooperate and exert the effectiveness of the government; (3) It can concentrate responsibility. And its disadvantages are: (A) It is easy to make the radical spirit of the party play to the extreme and make the party concept dominate everything at all times; (B) The cabinet pays too much attention to how to cater to the fantasies of the public at that time in order to win its support, and it is too neglectful of the true needs of the state; (C) Because the failure of the cabinet in Congress on specific events continuously forces the personnel needed by the government to leave administrative positions; (D) The concentration of power in Congress and the need to quickly decide and implement important decisions make those in charge unable to think deeply. As Bryce said in his famous book "Modern Democratic Government", "Its mistakes cannot be remedied."</p>
<p>Moreover, those who advocate the advantages of the cabinet system often assume that the people's will is easy to grasp and that the people's will is fixed at a specific time. This may be the case in countries with a small territory, pure culture, uniform education, well-informed news, and tight organization. However, in China in the near future, this assumption may be difficult to become a reality.</p>
<p>The presidential system of the United States is popular in several republics in South America. This system originated after the American Revolution, and its purpose is to maintain the security and order of the country. Its advantages are: (1) The country's policies can be implemented without being interrupted by the sudden failure of the cabinet, making the administration more continuous; (2) The president and the cabinet do not have to be distracted by opposing speeches and no-confidence votes, and can focus on work; (3) Legislative work is less dominated by the concept of party struggle, because the handling of various events may not involve the comparison of strength between parties; (4) Because the political forces of all parties can only be adjusted during the stipulated period, politics is more stable.</p>
<p>The importance of the advantages of the presidential system has been repeatedly proven by American history. When President Lincoln lost control of Congress due to the congressional election of 1862, he was still able to continue to engage in the Civil War. This would have been impossible under the responsible cabinet system. It would have been unimaginable if the administrative department had suddenly been reorganized in 1863.</p>
<p>The presidential system has been quite successful in the United States, but it has not been effective in other countries. Its inability to be arbitrarily transplanted is the same as the responsible cabinet system of Britain.</p>
<p>In addition to the above two systems, there are also the direct democracy system of ancient times and some states in Switzerland, the administrative committee system of the Swiss Confederation, and the tiered parliamentary system of Russia. The former two are not suitable for the Chinese environment, and there is no need to say more; as for the Russian system, it has developed from Russia's special historical and cultural background, and its advantages and disadvantages are difficult to judge.</p>
<p>The drafters of the Chinese constitution, in view of the differences in the Chinese situation, did not stick to any system and selectively adopted some parts of each system to suit the national conditions, which is commendable.</p>
<p>(4) China should adopt a unitary system, and the division of powers between the central and local governments should be broadly defined, not listed in detail.</p>
<p>In terms of the history of various countries, although it is not appropriate for countries with vast territories to concentrate power in the central government, countries with many foreign enemies, even if their territories are vast, cannot but adopt a unitary system. The federal system is mostly a product of history, and it is not enough to strengthen national defense and resist the invasion of strong neighbors. When a country has the possibility of foreign enemies, it would rather sacrifice the federal system and establish a strong central government.</p>
<p>The United States, Canada, British Australia colonies, and the Republic of South Africa have never had serious foreign enemies, and there is no need to establish a strong national defense system. It seems that there is nothing wrong with adopting a federal system. China's situation is different today. The constitution-makers should take into account the needs of national defense, so a unitary system is more desirable.</p>
<p>As for the distribution of powers between the central and local governments, the principle of maintaining balance should be the main purpose, that is, the powers related to the general nature of the whole country should be strictly under the central government, and those that are more closely related to the local area or have local characteristics should belong to the local area. However, the boundaries between the two should not be strictly defined. The two cannot be absolutely divided at any time. There is no universal standard for what is national and what is local. What was considered local in the past is now considered national. (The following text turns to the third edition)</p>

<h3>Over Two Hundred Million Yuan Fraud Case in Wuxing: Large Silk Shop Collapses After Using Tempting Bait to Collect Money; Most Creditors are Victims of High-Interest Loans</h3>
<p>[Our Wuxing News] Since the victory, the currency has depreciated, and prices have risen daily. Financial balance has been lost, and the economy is in a desperate situation. The lives of ordinary people are greatly threatened, and the hearts of the people in society are becoming more and more dangerous and fraudulent. Fraud, theft, and other things often happen. Now, Zhenkang Silk Shop on Xinzhuang Street in this city has branches in Shanghai, Suzhou, and other places. It is large in scale and wide in scope. The Huzhou branch is responsible for the entry and exit of funds from the China Communications and Second Banks, with Chai Zongyu as the person in charge, and Wang Zhongfu is responsible for other business entries and exits. Zhang Jichen is the manager of the Shanghai branch, and Xu Songsheng is the manager of the Suzhou branch. In addition to silk and crepe, they also engage in foreign exchange (high-interest loans are most prevalent in Wuxing, with interest of at least ten yuan per hundred yuan every ten days, but it must be deducted in advance when borrowing), issue bad checks, and hire employees to discount heavily with stores that have dealings with this city and Shanghai and Suzhou. At first, they settled on time, so they did not lose their credibility. Merchants and civilians who are greedy for profit are happy to deal with them. Unexpectedly, as of December 6, the Shanghai, Suzhou, and Huzhou branches closed down at the same time, and the responsible managers were all hidden and could not be seen. The affected creditors were panicked. According to the reporter's investigation, the total amount of defrauded money reached as much as 243 million yuan. Chunyuan Medical Garden on Dong Street in this city also guaranteed a loan of 10 million yuan from Zhenkang Silk Shop to the Huzhou China Bank, and was also affected. Because it could not afford to compensate, it has asked lawyer Wang De to declare liquidation. If the foreign exchange trend spreads, the entire commercial future of Wuxing will be unimaginable.</p>
<h3>This Year's New Recruits Will Be Sent Home After June If They Are Not Transferred; Explanation from the Commander of the Suzhou Regiment Management District</h3>
<p>[Our Suzhou News on the 12th] The Suzhou Regiment Management District Headquarters yesterday received an order from Chairman Chiang, stating that in order to strengthen combat power during the War of Resistance Against Japan, the term of service of soldiers in the camps of various units was specially extended. Now that the victory has ended and the army is being built, the Military Service Law has also been revised and promulgated. Matters such as enlistment and retirement should be handled in accordance with the regulations. All active army infantry soldiers who have served for more than two years, and infantry sergeants and special soldiers and special soldiers who have served for more than three years, should retire early during the subsequent reorganization. Although active-duty and eligible young men are being recruited into the camp for service, soldiers recruited into the camp after October 10 this year should follow the provisions of the Military Service Law, serve in a timely manner, and retire on schedule, so that the military service system is brought into line with the right track, etc. After receiving the order, Commander Du Xu, a colonel, met with reporters from this newspaper on the 12th to explain the time limit stipulated in the new Military Service Law, saying that the new Military Service Law stipulates that the term of service for supplementary soldiers is only six months, and they can retire after the expiration of the term. However, if there are vacancies in the National Defense Forces, the supplementary soldiers must be transferred to regular soldiers, with a term of service of two years, and they can also retire according to law after the expiration of the term. Therefore, the new recruits recruited this year, if not transferred, can all be sent home after June.</p>
<h3>Li Hanxin, a Traitor, Sentenced to Six Years</h3>
<p>[Our Suzhou News on the 12th] Li Hanxin, the leader of the special agent team of the enemy's Yangzhong Military Police, relied on the enemy's power to extort and blackmail when he was in office, doing everything he could. After the victory, he was sent by the Yangzhong County Government to the Suzhou High Procuratorate for investigation and prosecution. The case was closed on the 12th, and he was sentenced to six years in prison, suspended public accumulation for six years, and all property confiscated.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou Municipal Assembly to Hold General Meeting on the 16th</h3>
<p>[Our Hangzhou News on the 12th] The Hangzhou Municipal Assembly will hold its third general meeting on the 16th. It has received 37 proposals, and the focus of discussion will be the municipal government's policy plan and budget for the 36th year. Speaker Zhang Heng believes that there are many things to be done in the cause of local autonomy, and funds are scarce. Therefore, he proposed that citizens work hard to create property in order to seek long-term development, and hope to complete land valuation within one year to consolidate the foundation of municipal finance. As for the trial implementation of the police management district system in the three districts, the qualifications and skills of police officers still need to be improved, and it is hoped that the standards will be strictly checked.</p>
<h3>A Large Number of Teachers and Staff in Changshu Petition Collectively for Back Pay</h3>
<p>[Our Changshu News] The funds for the central national schools in this county have been in arrears for three months, and there is still no news of payment. Now, initiated by the schools in the urban area, a meeting of principals of central national schools throughout the county will be convened on the 13th at the county education association.

<h3>Shanghai County Chamber of Commerce Appeals for Reduction of Profit Tax</h3>
<p>[Our Minhang News] Regarding the profit tax issue in Shanghai County, the Songjiang Branch of the Direct Taxation Bureau insisted on stipulating a tax amount of 120 million yuan as the target for payment. Merchants and civilians throughout the county, due to sluggish business, cannot afford it, and appealed for a reduction to 100 million yuan to alleviate the difficulties of merchants, but the bureau did not approve it. Yesterday, Chairman Zhu of the County Chamber of Commerce invited all directors and supervisors, Secretary Zhang of the County Government, and Li Hengqi of the Local Association to discuss the matter. They all believed that the area of this county is less than one-third of that of Fengxian, and the number of shops is only one-sixth of that of Fengxian, while the profit tax of that county is stipulated to be 70 million yuan. Under the same jurisdiction, it seems unfair to estimate the huge tax amount in this county. Chairman Zhu of the County Chamber of Commerce, Chairman Lin of the Minhang Town Chamber of Commerce, and District Chief Wang of the First District were publicly elected to go to Songjiang to petition, appealing to the Taxation Bureau to consider the actual difficulties of the local area and approve the reduction. If the Taxation Bureau disregards the suffering of merchants and civilians throughout the county and does not grant their request, Chairman Zhu and others will go to the province to petition and present their difficulties in person, asking for correction.</p>

<p>[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch] In order to adapt to the needs of pacification affairs in northern Jiangsu, enhance the working knowledge and skills of autonomous personnel in various counties, and inspire their service spirit, the Jiangsu Provincial Government, through the Department of Civil Affairs, has ordered the formulation of a short-term training outline for township and village chiefs in the recovered counties of northern Jiangsu and ordered its strict implementation in the recovered counties.

<h3>Chaoxian County Council Impeaches Former County Magistrate</h3>
<p>Unclear Transfer of团 Grain Funds</p>
<p>[Our Chaoxian Dispatch] Liang Kan, the former magistrate of Chaoxian County, was previously accused and investigated by the Security Corporation. According to the county council: The county council recently established a clearing committee to investigate the documents, forms, and receipts related to the procurement and transportation of central-level B military grain handled by Liang Kan and Hong Xianchi, the former director of the county's field grain office, last year.

<h3>Replacement of Township Chief Takes Many Twists and Turns</h3>
<p>Taihe Council Requests Provincial Investigation</p>
<p>[Our Taihe Dispatch] Yao Shuhua, the township chief of Huangmiao Township in Taihe, was ordered to be dismissed by County Magistrate Li Pu in October, claiming that Yao was neglecting his duties. Wang Jingbo, the township chief of Gangyu County, was appointed. Li Yang, a member of the township council, Han Ding, and all the people, believed that Wang had bad behavior and requested the county government to appoint another person or to elect a new one by the people, but they were rejected. Fearing that the situation would escalate, the county council and the county party headquarters each sent a representative to Fuyang to request the Third District Commissioner and Deputy Security Commander Men Jinglai to handle the matter. The people still refused to accept Wang. On November 3, the county government issued a new order, dispatching a platoon of soldiers to escort Wang to a new location to work. The stalemate continued. On the 15th, the Third Commissioner also sent Section Chief Lu Hejian to the county to handle the matter. Li Handing and twenty other representatives from the township went to the city on the 18th to express the people's will. Section Chief Lu expressed a compromise solution: (1) The local people should accept Township Chief Wang's appointment. (2) He personally guaranteed that he would be replaced after three months. Li Handing and others agreed. On the 19th, Li and others went to the Social Service Office in the city and, while talking to Section Chief Lu, were suddenly arrested by the county government police and sent to the Judicial Office. On the 20th, three platoons of soldiers were dispatched to Huangmiao Township to arrest gentry and Baojia chiefs who refused to accept Wang. The arrests lasted for eight days. The Taihe County Council has recently submitted the above situation to the Provincial Council to forward it to the Provincial Government, ordering the county government to quickly release Li Handing and others and send personnel to investigate.</p>

<h3>Many Stores in Zhenjiang Close Down, Chamber of Commerce Decides to Investigate the Truth</h3>
<p>[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch] Since the Mid-Autumn Festival this year, dozens of stores, large and small, have closed down or announced the clearing of accounts. Among them, some have closed down due to sluggish business and daily losses, or have been exploited by high-interest loans. Recently, there has been a trend of stores falsely claiming bankruptcy to secretly recover their principal and interest. The amount of the closure is the money deposited by depositors. There are also many who use this to close down. The Zhenjiang Chamber of Commerce believes that such damage to others and self-interest is a loss of merchant morality. Yesterday, it specifically notified all guilds that if a store closes down, the Chamber of Commerce should send personnel to investigate the accounts to see if the losses are real before making a public judgment to curb the trend of closure.</p>

<h3>A Freak in Jiexiu, Shanxi Province: Three Heads, Wide Mouths, and Large Eyes</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 12th] In the wasteland in the northeast corner of Jiexiu City, the corpse of a newborn three-headed freak infant was recently found abandoned. The body, hands, and feet were no different from normal babies, but it had three heads, two of which were purplish-red, with mouths about two inches long, connected to the cheeks, and with teeth. The eyes were very large, crying out of their sockets, and there was a tuft of black hair outside the brain. The cause of this freak pregnancy awaits scientific research.</p>
<h3>Pound's Educational Discussion of the Chinese Constitution, Continued from Page 2</h3>
<p>Fortunately, the United States did not provide a detailed explanation of the terms used when defining the functions of the government in the Constitution when it was drafted. Therefore, it was still possible to expand the functions of the central government through skillful interpretation to meet the needs of the new era. The division of powers between the central and local governments in the United States is constantly changing and is not fixed. The trend is the expansion of national affairs and the strengthening of central power. If we compare the current situation with that of forty years ago, we will know that many local affairs have become national affairs due to changes in the environment, the needs of facts, and the interpretation of the courts. The United States Constitution only stipulated the outline on this point and left the detailed points to be resolved in the future, so as to achieve the effect of adapting to the time and place, which is a good plan.</p>
<p>The drafters of the Chinese Constitution adopted a system of equal power between the central and local governments, which is appropriate. They only set general principles for the system of equal power without making detailed and specific regulations, so that the legislative body can legislate according to the time and place in the future, and the constitutional interpretation body can interpret according to the time and place, which is consistent with the experience of the United States Constitution, and can be said to be a good way to take the strengths of others.</p>
<p>(V) Guarantee of People's Rights</p>
<p>Since the seventeenth century, individualists and natural law schools have regarded rights as sacred and inviolable. Modern scholars deny the existence of rights. Both are extreme and should not be taken. The former overemphasizes the interests of individuals, while the latter overemphasizes the general order. In today's countries with service as the goal, the two should be coordinated and maintain a balance.</p>
<p>How to divide the boundary between the rights of individuals and the powers of the government varies from time to time and from place to place, so what history shows us is inconsistent. It is not easy to stipulate the rights of the people.</p>
<p>The provisions of the Chinese constitutional draft on this point are generally appropriate, but there is no clear provision on whether individuals can request relief from the court like the American people for the laws that violate the Constitution. If we make a comprehensive observation of Article 9, Paragraph 3, and Article 26 of the constitutional draft, if the legislative body violates the provisions of Article 25, the people seem to have no right to request relief from the court.</p>
<p>Whether China should adopt the American system and allow individuals to have the right to request relief for laws that violate the Constitution depends on China's environment.</p>
<p>The American system can be traced back to the Middle Ages. Its purpose is to prevent the arbitrariness of Congress. Although the American people have expressed dissatisfaction, the federal and state governments still adopt it to this day. The promotion of this system depends on a sound court. Its judges must not only have legal knowledge but also understand the general political, economic, and social situation. Whether China should adopt this system seems worth considering.</p>
<p>(VI) Distribution of Five Powers</p>
<p>The most prominent feature of the Chinese constitutional draft is the five-part division of government functions. I believe that "Distribution of Powers" is more appropriate than "Separation of Powers" because the former contains the meaning of confrontation with each other, while the latter does not.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, the three-power system or the two-power system is not a system that must be adopted by constitutional or democratic countries, so the five-power system may not be unsuitable for constitutional or democratic countries.</p>
<p>Under the five-power system, the various departments of the government have equal status, and there is no situation where one is higher than the other. France and the United States often lack coordination and undermine political consistency and continuity because the status of a certain department of the government exceeds others. Article 45 of the Chinese Constitution stipulates that "The President may convene a meeting of the heads of the five branches to discuss matters concerning more than two branches and matters consulted by the President," which is sufficient to prevent the friction that may occur in France, the United States, and other countries, and improve political efficiency.</p>
<p>Some people think that the establishment of two departments in addition to the three departments in China may increase friction or divergence. They do not know that Article 45 is sufficient to prevent or reduce this possibility. Moreover, this system has a considerable basis in Chinese history and can be suitable for national conditions and produce good results.</p>
<p>The Legislative Yuan in the constitutional draft is different from the British Parliament, and its power is quite limited. The Executive Yuan is also different from the administrative department of France, and the exercise of its functions must be controlled by the Judicial Yuan. The Executive Yuan is translated into English as "Execotive yuan," which seems to have too narrow a meaning and can be changed to A ministrative yuan (that is, the meaning of the Executive Yuan).</p>
<p>The Examination Yuan is a special system in China, and it has many advantages. This is indeed a good way to ensure that the appointment and removal of civil servants are separated from party politics. Due to the activity of political parties in the United Kingdom, the so-called "Spoils system" has occurred in the appointment of civil servants, that is, the political winner can distribute government positions to his party members or supporters as spoils of war. The system of the Examination Yuan can avoid this drawback. The protection of the examination power is also worthy of attention.</p>
<p>The Control Yuan is also a special system inherent to China that meets modern needs. What everyone can ask about is often no one asks about. Corruption of officials is often unpunished in Western countries. Some people think that the election system can punish officials for dereliction of duty, but often the matter is too long ago and the action has long been forgotten by the general public. The authority and responsibility of the committees of foreign legislative bodies, administrative officials, and prosecutors are unclear, and the performance of their reporting of officials is also difficult to be satisfactory. The power of impeachment of Congress is hated by the general public in the United States. If the Chinese Control Yuan stands in a detached position and can specialize in its duties, there are few views in the West. This system is not a product of arbitrary and abstract ideals. It has a long historical background in China and can often make great contributions.</p>
<p>Some people ask whether the Executive Yuan should be changed to a "responsible cabinet" controlled by the Legislative Yuan, so that the Legislative Yuan becomes the British Parliament and manages functions other than legislation. I think that this kind of provision will make the Legislative Yuan unable to devote itself to legislative work. It is a big mistake for the legislative body not to pay attention to legislation.</p>
<p>Some people ask whether the Executive Yuan should be responsible to the President. I think it is impossible because if so, the President will lose his detached position.</p>
<p>The Judicial Yuan is the highest judicial organ, and its position is quite similar to that of the House of Lords in the United Kingdom. According to my imagination, it will be composed of jurists and politicians in the future. If so, the power to interpret the Constitution can be expected to be competent.</p>
<p>In the Chinese constitutional draft, there is also a point worth noting, that is, the Control Yuan has the right to submit constitutional issues to the Judicial Yuan for interpretation. According to the theory of this provision, the unconstitutionality of the law seems to be a dereliction of duty of the legislative body and should be sanctioned by the Control Yuan.</p>
<p>(VII) National Assembly</p>
<p>Although the National Assembly has more than two thousand representatives, it is not too large compared to the national conferences of the major political parties in the United States (with more than one thousand attendees). If appropriate talents can be involved and there are clear and reasonable provisions for the meeting's etiquette and procedures, it will not become an irresponsible mass organization.</p>
<p>Some people ask whether a small party-established representative organization should be established in the National Assembly. I think that this kind of system easily makes a few people become dictators. The constitutional draft has many provisions for the convocation of the National Assembly, so there is no need to adopt this system. The purpose of establishing the National Assembly is to let it ask about the major affairs of the country, and there is no need for it to manage the general affairs of the government. (End)</p>

<h3>Major Developments in the French Political Situation: Blum Appointed Prime Minister, All Parties Support Ending the Cabinet Crisis</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 11th] According to reliable sources, the leaders of the National Assembly held a meeting this morning, chaired by Mr. Auriol, Speaker of the National Assembly. Socialist Deputy Tetegat announced that the leader of his party and former Prime Minister Blum had accepted the formation of a new cabinet. It was once proposed at the meeting that the current Finance Minister Schumann (Popular Republican Party) be appointed Prime Minister, but it was firmly opposed by the Communist Party, which instead formally supported Blum as a candidate. At that point, Tetegat announced that if there were no other candidates, Blum would be prepared to accept this task.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 12th] After the French Communist Party decided to support Blum as Prime Minister, other major parties, including the Popular Republican Party, the Left Coalition, and the Republican Liberty Party, also supported Blum.</p>
<h3>Iranian Army Recovers Azerbaijan Province, Public Anti-Communist Sentiment Runs High, Leaders of Azerbaijan Democratic Party Flee into Soviet Territory</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Tehran, 12th] The Iranian General Command announced that government troops have entered Tabriz, the capital of Azerbaijan Province, today. At the same time, left-wing newspapers in Tehran have been sealed.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Tehran, 11th] According to an official announcement, Azerbaijan Governor Jevdet has notified Iranian Prime Minister Sultana that the Azerbaijan Democratic Army surrendered this afternoon.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Tehran, 11th] Although the Azerbaijan Democratic Army has surrendered, according to news from the province, the retreating Democratic Army is now in conflict with the people in many villages. Martial law has been declared in the city of Mianeh (200 kilometers southwest of Tabriz). All leaders of the Azerbaijan Democratic Party, except Provincial Senator Vegh Bestari, have fled. It is reported that Pishevari, Chairman of the Central Committee of the party, has crossed the border and fled into Soviet territory. It is noted that the Azerbaijan "rebels" occupied Tabriz on December 12 last year and established an autonomous government. The surrender came exactly one year later.</p>
<p>[United Press, Tehran, 12th] Today, the Iranian government forces continued to advance towards Tabriz, the capital of Azerbaijan Province, from Mianeh and Mahabad along uneven paths, encountering no resistance along the way. The Azerbaijan Democratic People's Army stopped resisting after its political leader, Pishevari, issued a final order to flee. Thousands of people spontaneously gathered in the streets to express their national patriotism. They lined up in front of the pro-Soviet Tudeh Party headquarters and shouted: "Long live the King, long live Sultana!" fully expressing their anti-communist sentiment. At the same time, they shouted slogans against Pishevari and "all those who want to sell the country to foreigners." Afterwards, the crowds lined up in front of the Army Department to cheer for the generals who planned to recover Azerbaijan.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 11th] The Soviet side once claimed that the US government supplied the Iranian government with forty four-engine heavy bombers on the 22nd of last month. This statement was firmly denied by a spokesman for the US State Department.</p>
<h3>Council of Foreign Ministers Decides on the Procedure for the Moscow Conference, the Soviet Union Actually Opposes China's Participation, Five-Nation Treaty to Be Signed on February 10 Next Year</h3>
<p>[Our New York Special Correspondent, 11th] The issue of China's participation in the Council of Foreign Ministers caused a strong friction between the two major groups of the East and the West at the first European peace drafting conference held in London in September 1945. Currently, US Secretary of State Byrnes has raised it again at the New York Council of Foreign Ministers. Byrnes advocated inviting China to attend the next Council of Foreign Ministers to participate in the drafting of the treaty with Germany, but was strongly opposed by Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov. Molotov even opposed China from becoming one of the countries invited to the German peace conference, pointing out that the Potsdam Declaration clearly stipulated that only countries that signed the German surrender could participate in the drafting of the German peace treaty. Tonight, the four foreign ministers agreed to appoint a foreign ministry to listen to the views of the small countries on the German peace treaty, and decided to adjourn the meeting held in New York from tomorrow. At the same time, after three and a half hours of discussion, the plan for the treaty negotiations with Germany to be held in Moscow on March 10 next year has been completed. The four foreign ministers will continue to debate the issue of China's participation tomorrow afternoon at 4 pm, and will also decide on the details of the treaty with the former five subordinate countries.</p>

<h3>Disarmament Proposal Fails to Reach Agreement, Will Be Returned to General Assembly for Handling</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, New York, November 11th] The drafting committee of the General Assembly's disarmament plan was unable to reach an immediate compromise today on the issue of investigating and disarming military forces. As a result, the focus shifted to discussing the overall disarmament plan. Chairman Spaak announced that it was impossible to reconcile the differing views of the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union regarding the simultaneous investigation of domestic and foreign military forces and armaments, making it impossible to merge them as a basis for an expanded disarmament plan. This issue must now be returned to the General Assembly for handling. The drafting committee only needs to pass one more agreement to complete the general disarmament and ban on atomic bombs plan.</p>

<h3>Southern Countries and Albania Form Customs Union, Precursor to a Balkan Slavic Federation</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, November 11th] Yugoslavia and Albania have concluded a customs union agreement, the scope of which is equivalent to the economic merger of the two countries. Observers here believe that this move is the first step towards organizing a Balkan Slavic Federation. Historically, especially in the 19th century, the conclusion of a customs union was often a precursor to political unification. After World War I, France, based on this fear, opposed the conclusion of a customs union between Germany and Austria. However, as of now, there is no indication that the South-Albanian customs union will be expanded to include Bulgaria.</p>

<h3>China and India (Part Two) (Written by Nehru)</h3>
<p>— Translated by Zhou Xiangguang, Our Correspondent in India</p>
<p>Many ancient Indian books were discovered in China around the eighth century AD. These books were all written in Sanskrit and were printed using woodblocks. The imperial printing bureau was established in China during the tenth century AD, and the printing technology developed rapidly during the Song Dynasty. At this time, exchanges between Chinese and Indian scholars were still close, such as exchanging books and classics with each other for hundreds of years. Therefore, India had printing technology at this time, but there is no sufficient evidence to prove it, and it is difficult to estimate the situation at that time. In the past, Chinese movable type printing was transmitted to Tibet. Today, I believe that Tibetan movable type printing is still the same as before. Chinese printing technology was transmitted to Europe during the Yuan Dynasty (1260-1368 AD), first to Germany, and by the fifteenth century, it had spread throughout Europe.</p>
<p>During the Indian Afghan and Mughal dynasties in India, China and India had frequent diplomatic contacts. For example, between 1326 and 1351 AD, Delhi Sultan Muhammad bin Tughlaq sent the famous Arab traveler Ibn Battuta as an envoy to the Chinese court. At this time, Bengal broke away from the protection of the Delhi Sultanate and became an independent Islamic kingdom. In the mid-14th century AD, the Chinese court sent two diplomatic envoys, Hu Xing and Fei Xing, to reside in the Bengal Sultan's court. This enabled Bengal to complete sending an envoy to China during the reign of Sultan Ghiyasuddin, which happened to be during the Ming Dynasty in China. Bengal's last envoy to China was during the reign of Emperor Saia-din in 1414, and they brought precious gifts, including a live qilin (Chinese unicorn). How this qilin was transported to India is quite surprising; perhaps this qilin was a gift sent from Africa, and was often offered to the Ming Emperor as a rare gift, which was praised by the Ming Emperor. Indeed, after this qilin arrived in China, it was greatly appreciated, and the disciples of Confucius recognized the qilin as an auspicious omen. There is no doubt that the qilin has a long history in China, and the Chinese embroider qilin on silk fabrics. The artists in the Chinese court have long phrases to explain how to appreciate this painting and the good fortune that can be obtained from it. Court officials and people alike watched this thing with endless appreciation.</p>
<p>Trade between China and India developed during the Buddhist era, and further developed during the Indian Afghan and Mughal dynasties, and continued to exchange goods. The route crossed the northern Himalayas on land and followed the original route of the camel caravans in Central Asia. However, there was also a sea trade route, passing through the islands of Southeast Asia, mainly to the ports of southern India.</p>
<p>Through more than a thousand years of exchanges between China and India, they have been able to understand some things from each other, not only in terms of thought and philosophy, but also in writing and science. Perhaps China has been more deeply influenced by India than India has been influenced by China, but India is also good at absorbing foreign cultures. It is regrettable that India has not obtained the essence of Chinese culture. If it had, India would have been able to use what it had obtained to stop its unnecessary fantasies. Although China has acquired a great deal of cultural art from India, she has remained independent and strong, and continues to use inexhaustibly on her own path of development, and in some places, adapting to her own social organization. Even Buddhism and its profound philosophy can be combined with the teachings of Confucius and Lao Tzu in China. But we see that Buddhist philosophy always contains a bit of pessimism, which has not been changed, and even benefits from the love of life and the optimism of the Chinese people. There is an ancient Chinese saying: "If you are caught by the yamen, you will be whipped to death; but if you are bound by the Buddha, you will starve to death."</p>
<p>In the sixteenth century AD, there was a famous novel in China, Journey to the West, written by Wu Cheng'en, which describes the various strange and wonderful events that Xuanzang experienced on his way to India. This book was dedicated to India: "I dedicate this book to the Pure Land of the Buddha, and I wish to repay the teacher's kindness with this book, and I wish to eliminate sins with this book..."</p>
<p>In the centuries after China and India lost contact, they both suffered unexpected encounters from the British East India Company. India has suffered for a long time, and China, although for a short time, also experienced the Opium War.</p>
<p>Now the wheel of fate is turning, and China and India look forward to the future and look back at the past. The new pilgrims who will climb the mountains will cross the continents or fly over the peaks, carrying their mission of joy and friendship, laying the foundation for close friendship.</p>
<h3>Soviet Troops in Germany Show Signs of Withdrawal, Espionage Personnel Active, Soviets Still Attempting to Maintain Political Control</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Berlin, November 11th] Soviet propaganda is once again actively spreading in Germany using new methods. American intelligence personnel strongly believe this. Spies and counter-spies are commonplace in Berlin, which is occupied by four countries, and are sometimes comical. According to a Berlin newspaper registered with the US side, the new activities of Soviet spies are due to the expectation that the boundaries of the German occupation zones will soon be eliminated, making the entire country an economic unit, and that the Western occupation zones and the Soviet occupation zone can trade freely. Once this is implemented, and the "Iron Curtain" is lifted, the Soviet side must find ways to maintain its political control and prevent the Germans in the occupation zone from being "infected" by the West. Therefore, they are using members of the United Socialist Party under the control of the Communist Party, with the assistance of the military government, to achieve electoral victories in the Soviet occupation zone. According to news from the German News Agency under British control, the United Socialist Party in the Soviet occupation zone has received the following orders: after the boundaries of the occupation zones are lifted, members of the United Socialist Party must be vigilant and pay attention to people visiting from the Western occupation zones. Even at present, leaders in each district must report uniformly. A well-informed German journalist who has close ties with the Soviet side and often travels within its occupation zone, claims that the slogan of the United Socialist Party is "Everyone is a spy." The Soviet Union is using the district leader system, where all loyal party members are responsible for maintaining the "political purity" of every resident in their district. This system was implemented when the Western Allies jointly occupied Berlin, but was later abolished due to the United States' insistence on opposition.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Helmstedt, Germany, December 12th] Soviet troops, equipped as if on a large scale, are retreating eastward from the Magdeberg area near the British occupation zone. Large convoys of military trucks can be seen on the highway crossing Berlin, heading towards Dresden and then to Eastern Europe. This action appears to be part of the demobilization movement of the Soviet occupying forces, but there are not many troops to be seen, probably returning home by train. Military trucks are constantly traveling along the road, carrying or towing smaller bullock carts, which clearly indicates a large-scale eastward movement by the Soviet side.</p>
<h3>Dredging Waterways to Facilitate Transportation</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Berlin, November 11th] The Soviets in their occupied zone of Germany are currently ordering thousands of Germans to carry out the Oder River project, expanding its "safe waterway" to transport reparations to the Soviet Union. This waterway connects to the port of Szczecin, passes through the Baltic Sea and reaches Leningrad, because the railways via Poland are often plagued by bandits, and Poland itself is facing many transportation problems. Since the Germans east of the Oder-Neisse line have been expelled, the Soviet Union cannot fully utilize the Polish railways. Regarding the Oder River dredging project, the Soviet authorities have kept it secret, but according to a German journalist who recently returned from the Soviet occupation zone, the river is full of red star ships, all of which are confiscated German merchant ships, which are currently busy loading German reparations, such as manufactured factory products, and dismantled machinery and equipment.</p>
<h3>Slavic Congress Concludes, Next Meeting in Prague</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Belgrade, November 11th] The Slavic Congress, which has been held here for several days, held its closing meeting today and decided to establish a 25-nation committee to engage in joint UN liaison work for the Slavic headquarters' information. The headquarters of the committee will be located in Belgrade. In addition, it was decided that the next Slavic Congress will be held in the Far East in 1948.</p>
<h3>Second Anniversary of Franco-Soviet Alliance, Paris Full of Pro-Soviet Rhetoric</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, November 11th] Today marks the second anniversary of the Franco-Soviet Alliance and Mutual Assistance Treaty. French officials praised the close friendship between France and the Soviet Union, believing that this kind of friendship is France's future political capital. It was said that France and the Soviet Union began to maintain a close friendship after signing the Mutual Assistance Treaty. The purpose of this treaty was to prevent Germany from launching an aggression again, but the fact that France and the Soviet Union often adopted the same approach when drafting the peace treaties with the five Axis powers of Italy, Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Finland proves that the Mutual Assistance Treaty has permanent importance. The Soviet Union has not only assisted France politically, but has also provided moral and material assistance to France in accordance with the spirit of the treaty. For example, when France faced a food shortage this spring, even though the Soviet Union itself was also facing difficulties, it still provided France with barley and wheat.</p>

<h3>Famous Chinese Deer Breed Survives in Britain, Antlers Point Straight Back Towards Tail</h3>
<p>[British News Agency, London, December 12th] In 1865, a French priest obtained a deer hide in the imperial gardens of Beijing that had never been seen in the Western Hemisphere. This deer is now known as the Père David's deer, with broad flat hooves and antlers pointing straight back towards the tail, shedding its antlers twice a year. At the end of the 19th century, the Duke of Bedford in Britain tried to transplant this deer to Britain. This move saved the deer from extinction, because in 1900, the imperial gardens of Beijing were flooded, and all the deer in the gardens died. The deer currently raised in Britain are the only remaining ones in the world.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Venezuelan Capital, November 11th] The official statement announced that Maracaibo, the capital of Marajuaya Province in Venezuela, had been occupied by a limited number of rebels colluding with the defense forces. Last night, a strange machine flew over the capital and was driven away by anti-aircraft fire.

<h3>Japan's Attitude Towards Reparations, "Mainichi Shimbun" Summarizes Seven Key Points</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, December 12th] "Mainichi Shimbun" today summarized the Japanese government's attitude towards the U.S. reparations plan, listing the main points: (1) The Japanese people's standard of living should not be lower than that of 1930. (2) The amount of foreign trade should not be lower than that of 1936, that is, the total import and export volume should be increased to 3.5 billion yen. (3) Unless foreign trade is developed, the purchasing power of the Japanese people cannot be increased. (4) Silk fish and porcelain should account for a quarter of local products in the export ratio. (4) Of Japan's 80 million people, 10 million should be engaged in industry, 15 million in agriculture, and another 5 million in commerce. (6) Japanese merchant ships should maintain 4 million tons to maintain coastal transportation and foreign trade (the Pauley plan only stipulates 1.5 million tons). (7) Japan needs foreign credit loans.</p>

<h3>Preparing to Investigate Male Citizens' Backgrounds: Three-Step Process Established, to be Announced After Approval by the Senate</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] According to Director Zhang Xiaosong of the Civil Affairs Bureau, the conscription issue in this city has yet to receive any explicit orders. Since the last municipal meeting decided that the Civil Affairs Bureau would handle conscription matters, the first step in the bureau's preparations is to investigate male citizens in the city and create precise statistics. Currently, the bureau, in accordance with the "Regulations for Implementing Male Citizen Background Investigations in the 35th Year of the Republic" issued by the Ministry of National Defense and adapting to the actual situation in the city, has drafted the "Shanghai Municipal Government's Resolution on Implementing Male Citizen Investigations in the 35th Year of the Republic." It stipulates that district offices are responsible for the investigation of male citizens. The investigation process is as follows: (1) Training: Aimed at male citizen investigation personnel from each district, organized by the district offices. Training subjects include revised conscription laws, household registration laws, regulations on preferential treatment for families of soldiers on expedition, and regulations on penalties for hindering military administration. (2) Implementation of the Investigation: The age range for this year's conscription eligibility is calculated from those born in the 16th year of the Republic (19 years old in the traditional count) to those born in the 11th year before the Republic (45 years old). During the investigation, the month and year of birth should be inquired, and they should be informed of their zodiac sign (e.g., those born in the Year of Yichou belong to the Ox). All male citizens of conscription age, regardless of their place of origin, should be registered at their current place of residence. If the workplace and residence are in different locations, the administrative district where they were originally registered should be inquired to avoid duplicate registration and omissions. Household heads, neighborhood chiefs, and security chiefs must issue a pledge guaranteeing no omissions. After the district prepares a document to submit to the government for filing, each neighborhood will convene a neighborhood meeting to report on the investigation process and publicly report omissions and personnel who have failed in their legal duties. The above investigation tasks are assigned to specific individuals. Those at all levels who perform exceptionally well or poorly will be reported by the government to the Ministry of National Defense for separate rewards and punishments. If agencies, national organizations, schools, or factories obstruct the investigation or are found to be sheltering male citizens, they will be reported to the Ministry of National Defense for rectification. The aforementioned methods have been submitted to the Senate and will be announced and implemented upon approval.</p>
<h3>"Year-End Bonuses" for Various Industries: Observing the General Situation, the Problem Should Not be Serious; Strengthening Labor Discipline Still Relies on Cooperation from Both Sides</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] According to qualified individuals, the issue of year-end bonuses this year is limited to one month's salary and depends entirely on profit margins. On the other hand, it is implied that profitable factories should automatically increase year-end bonuses appropriately to satisfy labor's demands. At the same time, the organization of workers should be strengthened to prevent those with ulterior motives from having ample opportunities to cause disruption. In fact, this organizational work has been quite effective. The biggest proof is that in the street vendor incident, no factory workers participated. As for the issue of strengthening labor discipline, relevant personnel believe that the current lax discipline is the result of a lack of proper management during the Anti-Japanese War. What is now required of workers is, firstly, to abide by laws and regulations and maintain order; and secondly, to gradually restore pre-war production standards. In order to achieve the above goals, the authorities will strengthen the training of union leaders to instill a sense of awareness and responsibility, enabling them to lead workers onto the path of legality. The second step is to improve "factory conferences" so that representatives from both labor and management can meet together, communicate opinions, and avoid misunderstandings. Currently, many factory conferences exist in name only without achieving practical results. Insufficient understanding from the management and incorrect perceptions from the labor side are both responsible. At the same time, labor management agencies will consider the welfare of workers in their practical work and alleviate their suffering in order to gain the trust of workers and prevent agitators from using their tactics. As for the policy of passive suppression, it is the least reliable and the authorities have no intention of adopting it.</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn Year-End Bonuses and Coal Allotments: Mayor Wu Discusses Three Issues</h3>

<h3>Auspicious Day, Festive Atmosphere: Twenty Couples Hold Group Wedding</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] December 12th is an important anniversary in Chinese history and a rare auspicious day in the lives of couples. It symbolizes pairing, perfection, and good fortune more than any other day.</p>
<p>At 11 AM, the Weihai Health New Life Club was filled with a festive atmosphere. Twenty couples stood side by side under the ever-smiling Mayor Wu. The wedding march played out the joy in their hearts. The famous matchmaker, Ding Fubao, could not help but offer some witty remarks. Then came the photography, and the ceremony was completed.

<h3>New Tax Rates Significantly Reduced: Impacting the City's Revenue by 70 Billion Yuan Annually; Finance Bureau's Request for Revision Still Pending</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Legislative Yuan has recently revised the regulations on banquet taxes, entertainment taxes, license plate fees, and property taxes, and the National Government promulgated them on the 4th of this month. The reduction in tax rates is quite significant, greatly impacting the city's finances. It is reported that the municipal government has repeatedly telegraphed the central government to make changes, adding "in the new revised regulations, 'if the local situation is special, it can be approved by the local Senate to appropriately increase, but not exceeding double.'" However, when the above request was not answered by the central government, the new tax regulations were promulgated by the National Government, and the city should immediately comply. However, the municipal government authorities believe that the city's economic situation is extremely difficult, so they recently telegraphed the central government again, requesting that the new regulations be returned to the Legislative Yuan for further revision. Before it is raised to the National Defense Supreme Committee for resolution, they requested permission to temporarily maintain the current tax rates and methods.</p>
<p>Yesterday, reporters visited the person in charge of the Finance Bureau and asked about the impact of the new tax rates on the city's financial revenue. The response was: "The difference between the new tax rates and the current tax rates is very large, a reduction of about 65 percent. If the newly revised regulations are followed, the city's tax revenue would be reduced by about 6 billion yuan per month, and 70 billion yuan per year. The city government's annual revenue is only 130 billion yuan, which is 370 billion yuan short of the 500 billion yuan budgeted for next year."</p>
<h3>Civil Servants' Signature Campaign: Urging Implementation of Salary Adjustments and Requesting Allocation of Winter Clothing Allowance</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] According to central government regulations, civil servant salaries are adjusted every three months. Therefore, adjustments should have been made in November, but there has been no movement so far. Civil servants in this city have launched a real-name signature campaign yesterday, echoing the demands of civil servants in the capital, requesting the central government to implement salary adjustments in accordance with the regulations and promises, and have jointly requested the authorities to follow the example of the Four Banks and One Bureau and state-owned administrative agencies, and allocate a winter clothing allowance of 500,000 yuan. If the above request cannot be implemented immediately, then at least request permission to borrow one month's salary to get through the New Year. It is reported that more than a hundred civil servants in the Finance Bureau have signed their names.</p>
<h3>Many Slum Dwellings Under Protection: Changning District Ranked First</h3>
<p>Demolition Should Only Proceed After Proper Handling</p>
<p>Since the municipal government decided to ban slum dwellings, in addition to strictly prohibiting the construction of new slum dwellings since the day before yesterday, an investigation of existing slum dwellings is also being implemented. Changning District, the area with the most slum dwellings, was inspected yesterday by the Senate. There are a total of 4,877 households, among which all of the 8th neighborhood are slum dwellings. In addition, neighborhoods 5, 7, 8, 10, 13, 16, 20, 21, 22, 26, and 28 also have many slum dwellings. If these are demolished, the municipal government must first find a way to make proper arrangements.</p>
<h3>Youth Center Director: 4th Tour Group</h3>
<p>Since the city's youth center organized the third youth tour group to visit the Taikang warship and the Jiangnan Shipyard, the participating youth have felt excited and have repeatedly requested the center to continue organizing them. It is known that the center's fourth youth tour group will be held at 9 AM on the 18th to visit Longhua Airport and airplanes. At the same time, they will take a plane for an aerial tour of the city to arouse youth's interest in aviation. It is reported that this time it is limited to 30 people, with a fee of 30,000 yuan per person (10% discount for members), and registration is now open at the center.</p>
<h3>Autumn Property Tax: Still According to Original Methods</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the person in charge of the Finance Bureau stated that although the revised Property Tax Regulations were promulgated by the National Government on the 4th of this month, the municipal government has not yet received a formal order. Therefore, the city's autumn property tax and municipal construction tax will still be collected according to the original methods. The taxes currently being collected are the autumn taxes, which were before the National Government promulgated the revised Property Tax Regulations, so they are not affected by it. Moreover, the municipal government's construction tax and property tax are two different taxes, each with its own basis. Revising the municipal government's property tax regulations does not mean revising the municipal construction tax, so they are two separate matters.</p>
<h3>Several Districts Adjacent to the City: Requesting to be Incorporated into Shanghai Municipality</h3>
<p>Regarding the boundary issue between Shanghai Municipality and Jiangsu Province, a plan has been drafted and is currently being reviewed by the Ministry of Interior. It is learned that several districts adjacent to the city have separately requested the municipal government and the Senate to incorporate the districts into Shanghai Municipality to meet the needs of building a Greater Shanghai. For example, Zhang Shouxiang and eight other representatives of the Huazhuang District in the 16th District, as well as various businesses in the district, recently jointly requested that the district be incorporated into the municipal government. The reasons they gave include: "Considering that the municipal government does not abandon the remote and desolate, and is generously starting to reorganize the Baojia system, organize local autonomy structures, promote education, and then establish Xinzhuang, Chunshen, and Zhang Yuban, carry out health work, protect the people's health, assist in establishing volunteer police, and promote local joint defense. The municipal government has implemented all these things step by step, so although it has not been formally taken over in name, it has already been established in fact."</p>
<h3>Foreigners' Land Registration Encountering Obstacles: Consulates Deliberately Making Things Difficult, Attempting to Maintain the Right to Handle It, Firmly Unwilling to be Bound by the Deadline</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Since the opening of land registration for foreigners in this city, registration by stateless foreigners has been very enthusiastic, but very few foreigners with nationality have registered. In terms of deadlines, the former has a deadline at the end of the year, while the latter believes that the consulates of their respective countries are subject to equal constraints. As a result, the progress of land registration for foreigners has encountered obstacles, although convenience and preferential treatment have been provided in many ways. For example, land registration by our government should normally collect registration fees. However, after the competent authorities requested instructions from the central government, it was actually handled free of charge for foreign land registration, which is already an excessive preferential treatment. However, the consulates of various countries are still not satisfied and are deliberately making things difficult. One reason is the lingering influence of their past sense of superiority, and the other is the desire to maintain the right of consulates to handle land registration during the concession era. In the unequal concessions, they even used this power to force Chinese people to sell their land at extremely low prices. Now that the concessions have been recovered, this kind of privilege that hinders our country's sovereignty can never be allowed to continue. It is also learned that the requests to have consulates register land on behalf of foreigners are most strongly supported by the British and French, while the attitude of the United States is not very active.</p>
<h3>Suggestion to Abolish Fuel Control: Executive Yuan Replies to the Senate That Now is Not the Time; International Industrial Exhibition Should Also Be Postponed</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Senator Wang Zhengyan of the Municipal Senate previously proposed at the General Assembly to abolish fuel control. Speaker Pan and Deputy Speaker Xu Jifu transferred the proposal to the municipal government for submission to the Executive Yuan for approval. Now the Senate has received a telegram from the Executive Yuan, transferred through the Municipal Government, stating that it is difficult to comply. The telegram stated: "The public transportation industry and power in Shanghai mostly use bituminous coal, and most citizens use white coal for cooking. After the Shanghai District Fuel Management Committee took effective measures such as centralized management to support various regions, increase production, and expand transportation capacity, the market price has been quite stable and the supply is sufficient since March of this year. There is no coal shortage. The so-called panic about coal shortages is likely referring to the white coal briquettes used for heating in wealthy families. The price increase of these white coal briquettes does not affect public transportation power or cooking. Moreover, merchants can freely transport and sell these white coal briquettes, which are not under government control. However, because they can be freely transported and sold, they are not being controlled. When winter is approaching, wealthy families compete to hoard them, and merchants take the opportunity to manipulate the market, causing a shortage panic. The Senate believes that coal merchants have limited capacity to mine and transport white coal and cannot supply the market in large quantities. We are working to purchase them in various ways and plan to sell the newly arrived white coal at factory prices to increase supply and stabilize the black market. Currently, the distribution of coal is based on a reasonable method, so the request is not the right time."</p>
<p>Also, the Municipal Senate resolved at its first general meeting to suggest that the Ministry of Economic Affairs hold an international industrial exhibition in Shanghai on September 3rd next year. The Executive Yuan also believes that the scale of this matter is grand and must be based on sound industrial construction before it can be prepared. Moreover, the country's post-war recovery work has not yet been completed, and it may not be possible to hold it at that time, so it should be postponed.</p>
<h3>Preventing Theft of Goods: Implementing Ship-Based Security</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Since the resolution of the American sailors' strike, about sixty UNRRA relief material transport ships will arrive in Hong Kong in succession within two weeks. In order to prevent theft of goods, the Municipal Port Affairs Committee invited relevant agencies to discuss responsibilities. The methods are as follows: (1) After UNRRA relief material ships arrive in Lujiazui, the Security Affairs Section of the Shanghai Storage and Transportation Bureau of the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CNRRA) will notify the Inspection and Security Group in writing one day in advance about the location of the ship and the loading and unloading of goods and security matters. The group will then notify the Water Police Bureau, the Port Police Department, or the Security Police Corps to send police to be responsible for security. (2) In order to ensure thorough security and clear responsibility for UNRRA relief materials, the principle of "ship-based security" will be adopted. From the ship's side or the dock to the warehouse, the supervision of ship transportation, handling, and stacking will be carried out by the responsible security units. The responsible persons will sign a joint military agreement to clarify responsibilities. (3) The ships' sailors handling the UNRRA relief materials are not allowed to take any items off the ship during unloading and may be inspected by security personnel. (4) CNRRA must send a list of the names, labels, and organization of the relief materials transported to China this time to the group, which will then be forwarded to the Criminal Investigation Division of the Municipal Police Bureau, so that the anti-theft departments will pay attention to prevent the sale of stolen goods on the market. (5) The inspection group will send personnel to observe the work of each security unit for assessment purposes.</p>
<h3>Restoring the Pre-War Foreman System: Negotiating Standards for Handling Fees</h3>
<p>The prevalence of theft at the ports in this city makes companies and merchants anxious and difficult to cope with. Most of these pickpockets collude with dock cargo handlers. Therefore, in order to avoid losses to customers, each port company, holding a Borrowing Opinion certified by the Shipping Association, forwarded it to the Transportation and Obligation Affairs Committee. After discussions, it was decided to restore the pre-war factory foreman system, allowing each shipbuilding company to freely hire factory workers and assign foreman personnel to be responsible for transportation, loading, and unloading. Currently, this foreman system has been implemented first by Dalian and Datong Lianjing, and they have published announcements about the names and job scopes of the foreman personnel responsible for supervision. At the same time, the Port Affairs Committee, in order to reverse the handling fees at the port, will unite with relevant parties to organize a handling fee review committee to negotiate reasonable fees. However, before deciding on the handling fees, the control work should be the prerequisite. The standard of labor costs for each item should be based on the actual monthly wages of the dock workers, with the number of working days per month as the monthly wage, and then divided by the average number of items handled by the workers each day, which is the labor cost per item. In addition, add a certain percentage separately as supervision fees, company management fees, and company profits, which is the standard handling fee rate. The above plan has been submitted by the Port Affairs Committee to the Social Affairs Bureau for research.</p>
<h3>Gunboat Collides with Dock Boat: Boat Captain Responsible for Accident Summoned</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] At 10 AM on the 3rd of this month, on the Huangpu River at the 9th Pier of the China Merchants Bureau in Nanshi, a large dock boat loaded with bricks and tiles owned by Pan Zhaorui (44 years old) from Zhuicheng was heading northwest when it was head-on collided by the Jiangsui gunboat of the First Base Command of the Navy Department. Pan's second son, Guoli, drowned and his body has not been recovered. Yesterday, a report was made to the Water Police Sub-bureau. The traffic police dispatched police to summon Wu, the captain of the gunboat, for questioning. It was determined that he was suspected of negligent injury. In addition to being released on bail by the First Base Command of the Navy Department, the entire case was transferred to the Garrison Command for disposal. However, the captain denied any wrongdoing, claiming that this paper was insufficient to prove him guilty. The case is scheduled for another hearing on the 19th of this month.</p>

<p>Shipping Industry Hosts Seamen's Representatives</p>

<h3>Testimony in U.S. Military Tribunal: Ohler Stated Takashima Requested Continued Cooperation from Germany, Denies Knowledge of Personnel Working for Japan</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Ohler, wartime head of the intelligence agency for the Far East in the town of Lin Yuan, testified yesterday as a witness in a U.S. military tribunal that several days after Germany surrendered in 1945, representatives of the Japanese military came to Ohler's office to take over. At that time, the agency's assets consisted of 30 ounces of pure gold, a quantity of silver dollars, over 130,000 marks in the Deutsch-Asiatische Bank, and over 100,000 marks deposited in Tokyo. The Japanese side did not confiscate these assets at the time, but a month later converted the bank deposits into overseas Chinese reserve certificates, giving half to the Japanese side and allowing Ohler to control and use the remaining half.</p>
<p>Ohler admitted that Takashima, the head of the Japanese intelligence agency in Shanghai at the time, had asked him to continue cooperating. However, he did not agree. Regarding the voluntary continued work of some of Ohler's agency personnel for the Japanese side, he testified that he was unaware of it at the time. However, the subtle point was that he also admitted that after his activities with the Japanese leaders had changed, he was still able to continue occupying the agency's address, and a few days later, a secret telephone line was installed, connecting to Takashima's office.</p>
<h3>Theater Manager Disregards the Law, Assaults Finance Bureau Personnel, Burns Evidence of Tax Evasion</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The Finance Bureau recently received reports of tax evasion at the Lianhe Hebei Grand Theater at 791 Tianyun Road in this city. As a result, at 11:00 AM yesterday, two senior officials were dispatched, along with investigators, to conduct an investigation. Inside the theater's employee dormitory on the second floor, they seized various tax ledgers and receipts related to tax evasion. Just as they were about to investigate, Wang Yongli, the theater's manager in charge of preparations and operations, began to argue forcefully and ordered the theater employees to pull down the iron gate, intending to reclaim the tax evasion ledgers. However, the Finance Bureau personnel refused. Seeing that his objective was not achieved, Cheng, with a yell to strike, seized the ledgers and burned them. Two senior officials from the Finance Bureau were beaten and injured. Upon receiving the news, the North Station Sub-bureau dispatched police to quell the situation, bringing both parties to the station for interrogation. It was learned that the theater did indeed have evidence of tax evasion and that Cheng had openly assaulted and insulted public officials. After a preliminary trial by Sub-bureau Chief He, the evidence was confirmed, and he ordered the detention of Cheng Wei and Wang Yongting, pending transfer to the District Procuratorate for legal proceedings.</p>
<h3>Work Competition Promoted in Production and Transportation Sectors</h3>
<p>The Work Competition Promotion Committee, considering that the production and transportation sectors in the Shanghai-Nanjing region occupy an important position nationwide, believed that the implementation of work competition methods to improve efficiency and increase production would greatly benefit national economic construction. To this end, it specially dispatched team leader Yang Boqing and commissioner Zou Ping, along with team leader Chen Kui from the Ministry of Transportation's competition team, to Shanghai. They consulted with the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and the Shanghai Maritime Affairs Bureau, intending to first hold work competitions on safe journeys, punctual arrivals, fuel conservation, and ship cleanliness. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company will assign a dedicated person to be responsible. The Maritime Affairs Bureau will convene a meeting of industry and labor union leaders to discuss implementation methods soon.</p>

<h3>Love Triangle: Bodyguard Kills, Wu Guorong Appeals, High Court Concludes Hearing Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Wu Guorong, a bodyguard at the Kong Mansion, had a wife named Lu Lilien, who resided in Shanghai. When the Pacific War broke out, Wu was working under Director Sui in America. After the city fell and communication with Wu in America was cut off, Wu's wife, Lu Lilien, moved to the home of her husband's uncle, Wu Rongfang. Due to the cessation of remittances from America, she faced financial difficulties. She then met Xu Li, an official at the pseudo-Minhang Tax Investigation Office, and lived with him. After the victory, Wu Guorong returned and took Lu Lilien back, residing at 7 Yanping Village, Wenlin Road. The couple's feelings for each other had not diminished. However, Wu was unaware of his wife's cohabitation with Xu. Later, Xu often used this as blackmail, asking Lu for money. Lu often entrusted her sister-in-law, Tong, to deal with him, giving him property on multiple occasions. On March 10th of this year, Xu went again and coincidentally encountered Wu Guorong himself on Hengzhong Road. Xu reported everything that had happened before, claiming that he had taken care of Wu's wife, Lu Lilien, for six years and now demanded to support her for three years, with Wu providing housing and all living expenses. On March 19th, Wu visited Xu again to continue negotiations. The matter could not be resolved immediately. Wu hired a rickshaw to Xu's home in Tushanwan for further secret talks. Upon arriving there, Wu drew a gun and killed Xu Li before fleeing. Later, after police investigation, he was arrested and prosecuted by the District Procuratorate for murder. On June 24th of this year, he was sentenced to five years imprisonment by the District Court. Wu, dissatisfied with the sentence, appealed to the High Court. The hearing was held yesterday. Wu claimed that the rickshaw was stolen by Xu and after arriving in Tushanwan, Xu invited several leniency. The court will pronounce the verdict at 2:00 PM on the 20th of this month.</p>

<h3>Domestic Films Need Support, Lack of Funds and Equipment, Filmmakers' Lives are Hard</h3>
<p>[Special Feature by This Newspaper] We who make films must of course intensify our efforts to improve domestic films and increase production. But at the same time, we also hope that people from all walks of life can support domestic films and help them overcome the current difficulties. Chinese films have a future, but first they must overcome this obstacle. After chatting with reporters about the current state of domestic films, Xu Suli, director of the China Film Studio, made the following conclusion.</p>
<p>Now, the materials, "war use," scenery, remuneration, and some operating expenses for filming a movie cost approximately 250 million yuan. Due to the sluggish market, high prices, and restrictions on Nanyang bridges, the revenue from the first two or three runs is often not enough to cover the cost. The domestic film business is currently best in Shanghai and Nanjing.</p>
<p>Among the recent domestic new films released in this city: "The Family of Shi Yi," "Return to the Mortal World," "Records of the Holy City," "Lotus Turns White, Swallows Fly," and "Iron Bones, Ice Hearts," "The Loyal Family" performed the best. At the Grand Light, it played for one month and two days, and the revenue from the first run was enough to cover the cost. The main reason was that it was the first domestic new film released after the victory.</p>
<p>Currently, domestic films struggle to be shown in better-equipped cinemas. On the one hand, because those theaters have economic ties with American production companies, they of course prioritize showing American films; on the other hand, because there are fewer domestic films produced and their quality is worse, it is not easy to win over theaters. However, there are some enthusiastic cinemas that like to show domestic films.</p>
<p>Reasons for slow production</p>
<p>As for the reasons for the slow production of domestic films: (1) Insufficient capital, because the cost is extremely high and the revenue is low, so the turnover is inflexible. (2) The equipment is too poor, and it is verified to improve it immediately. (3) Not enough talent.</p>
<p>Speaking of the lives of film practitioners, they are also quite hard. Ordinary people think that movie stars must lead luxurious and comfortable lives, but in China, this is not the case.</p>
<p>Now, the remuneration for film awards is mostly calculated on a per-movie basis, and long-term contracts are rarely signed. This is because prices are constantly rising, and signing a contract is inevitable. Moreover, film companies cannot afford huge salaries. Currently, the remuneration for a famous actor starring in a film is approximately 10 million yuan, but they can only make two or three films a year. As for supporting actors, the remuneration is calculated on a daily basis, approximately 20,000 to 50,000 yuan per day. Those extras are even worse, earning only 8,000 to 10,000 yuan per day.</p>
<p>The cost of directing a film ranges from 4 million to 10 million yuan. The remuneration for writing a film script is approximately 2 to 3 million yuan. There is currently no problem with film business. It usually takes approximately 20,000 to 30,000 feet of film to shoot a movie. The actual length of the film is approximately 10,000 feet. As for the venue equipment and machines, they are all too backward.</p>
<p>New films are completed one after another</p>
<p>Finally, let's talk about the festivals of various production companies. China Film Second Factory has already released two films: "The Loyal Family" and "Orioles Fly in the Mortal World." "Love from Afar," directed by Chen Shengting, has also been filmed and is currently being edited. It can be released around the solar New Year. Currently being filmed or about to be filmed are "Returning Home in Glory," directed by Zhao Dan and starring Tan Ying; "Spring Dream in Heaven," directed by Tang Xiaodan and starring Lu Ming; "Welcoming Spring Song," directed by Wu Shuiguan and starring Jin Hua. Planned to be filmed are "Heavenly Sins and Earthly Traps," directed by Ma Chuwei, and "The Legend of the Eight Immortals," directed by Fang Pei.</p>
<p>China Film First Factory used to specialize in shooting news documentaries and was responsible for washing and printing work. Recently, it is preparing to produce "Homecoming Diary," directed by Zhang Junxiang and starring Bai Jing.</p>
<p>The "Shanghai Film Experimental Factory," hosted by Fei Mu, has been working silently. "Money Bones, Ice Hearts" has already been released, and "Beautiful Rivers and Mountains" will also be able to meet the audience soon.</p>
<p>As for the Lianzhong Film Studio, the United Film Company plans to shoot Shen Congwen's "Border Town," directed by Ye Zhen. Phoenix Film Company is also filming "Eight Thousand Miles of Clouds and Moon" and "A River of Spring Water Flows East" there. Lianzhong's site is the largest in Shanghai.</p>
<p>The Cathay Film Company, hosted by Liu Zhonghao, is filming two films. One is "Sparks of the Nation," directed by Yang Xiaozhong, and the other is "Song of Leaving Home," directed by Li Pingqian.</p>
<p>As for other cities, Beijing has the "China Film Third Factory." "Record of the Holy City" has already been released. Currently being filmed is "Top Secret Number One," directed by Shuguang and starring Ouyang Shafei.</p>
<p>Changchun's "China Film Fourth Factory," also known as "Changchun Film Studio," is hosted by Jin You, taking over the former "Manchukuo Film." However, all the equipment was taken by the Communist Party, so they can only shoot newsreels now. The film industry in Hong Kong is constantly booming. Such as "Dahua Film Company" and "National Film Company."</p>
<p>In short, domestic films definitely have a future. But it needs everyone's support, everyone's love.</p>

<h3>Six Measures Passed to Organize Normal School Education</h3>
<p>[Also] Councilor Jiang Jizhou proposed that, based on the Council's first General Assembly's resolutions on education and the Ministry of Education's regulations on normal schools, draft measures to organize the city's normal schools for public resolution. The measures to organize normal school education are as follows: (1) Normal schools should be established separately in accordance with the Education Bureau's regulations, and male and female schools should be separated. (2) Xinlu Normal School, which only enrolls male students, should add a female normal school.

(6) Normal school students should all live on campus. Resolution: Pass the original measures and send them to the city government.</p>
<p>Land Administration Committee The Land Administration Committee had six councilors in attendance, chaired by Wang Xianqing. The Director of the Land Administration Bureau reported three points: (1) Land price tax has been levied since the 16th of last month, and half of it has now been collected. It is estimated that all of it can be collected by the end of this year. (2) Regarding the question of whether to abolish the housing rent standard, a consulting committee will be convened before the end of this month for detailed study. (3) Regarding encouraging the construction of houses to solve the housing shortage, a draft of the Shanghai Municipality's Implementation Rules for Encouraging the Construction of Houses and Leasing Public Land has been specifically drafted and submitted to the municipal meeting for approval.

Director Zhu has given an oral report, and it is proposed to uniformly change the three-month period stipulated in Article 6 to six months.

<h3>Citizens Suggest Three Points to Improve Public Health</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The City Council yesterday received a letter from citizen Ding Fubao of this city, suggesting that the city government improve the city's sanitation facilities. The letter stated: More than a year after the victory, the city government has taken over the city's administration and has achieved remarkable results. However, there are still some areas that the Health Bureau has not fully addressed. Therefore, three points are suggested: (1) Since the Sanitation Office took over from the bureau, the city treasury has increased a large income every month. However, the price of fertilizer sold should be adjusted to meet the needs of rural fertilization. It should not follow the contractor's approach of arbitrarily increasing the selling price, regardless of farmers' purchasing power. At the same time, the work part should also be updated and renewed. (2) Public toilets are set up for the benefit of the common people in the city. They should be directly managed by the City Health Bureau, with the goal of the lowest price for toilet paper to benefit the common people. This is in line with the original intention of setting them up, and the city government can also increase revenue every month. However, the bureau still adopts the old contractor system, allowing layers of exploitation by large and small contractors, with some profiting from it. This should be improved. (3) The amount of garbage discarded in this city every day is considerable. This matter should also not be handled by contractors, because contractors only seek profit, and the transportation work is often perfunctory, resulting in accumulation from time to time. At the same time, there are very few transport ships, and they leak along the way, causing siltation in the inland rivers and the Huangpu River. It is hoped that the authorities can purchase landing craft for large-scale transportation.</p>
<h3>Women's Cultural Society to Open Tomorrow</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The Chinese Women's Cultural Society, initiated and organized by Wu Yuan and Luo Jianbing, has been prepared and is scheduled to open tomorrow on North Sichuan Road.

Currently, it is planned to first establish a women's school and a reading room, and publish women's publications.</p>

<p>青白征港首戰記　一球敗於星島隊</p>
<p>本報特約記者子鍵</p>
<p>〔香港九日訊〕「青白隊此次南來，實開戰後港滬體育界互相聯繫之先河，體育本不重勝負，青白隊能表現良好之體育精神，使港人得覩一場良好球賽，至爲可喜。」</p>
<p>這是我國出席台維斯杯網球賽代表蔡惠全九日晚在星島體育會歡宴青白隊席上演說的一段話。青白隊此次不遠千里，惠然南來，真是一九四六年香港體境的一個盛大壓軸表演。自本月開始，港中報章即連續出刊青白隊員抵港的消息，一般球迷紛紛推論未來戰局。十二月的日子，正是本港足球季節的中心，快活谷裏，銅鑼灣頭，早已殺氣喧騰，中外球員，打得落花流水，青白隊則於此時出戰，真個錦上添花。</p>
<p>籃球隊　　兩場連戰連勝</p>
<p>青白隊挾持兩支人馬籃球與足球，奔向南國小島來，香港是中國足球隊的搖籃地，青白似乎胸有成竹，所以改用籃球隊出馬，七日八日連接兩場，雙雙告捷，不愧名將本色。這兩場一對港中籃球的最堅強的隊伍—青年會，以四五對卅五先敗後勝，一對港中精銳的黑貓隊、以七十對十廿九去的一面倒的大捷。青白籃球英雄們經過兩演身手，港中批評家給了他們十四字的評論，那是：</p>
<p>「一個人演出有成就，全隊聯絡未見好。」</p>
<p>主力戰　　九月正式揭幕</p>
<p>青白隊的主力戰，到了九日才正式揭幕，兩天前，青白的龍員虎將，先後由滬粵來港，青白的對手，是港中本屆足球賽實力最強的星島隊，雙方人馬，幾經考慮，最後決定了陣勢如下：</p>
<p>靑白隊</p>
<p>秦必高　嚴士鑫　吳祺祥　宋霆聖　孟義良　瞿永福　許文奎　羅壽福　李義臣　高保正　費春華</p>
<p>星島隊</p>
<p>朱兆恒　譚江柏　侯容生　馮坤勝　許克成　劉松生</p>
<p>曹秋亭　黎兆榮　張金海　馮景祥　何應芬</p>
<p>七分鐘　　背白便告失守</p>
<p>九日過午加路連山頭，以佈滿無數球迷，門票分二元四，三元五兩種，購買入座者約二千人，收入萬元，折合國幣已過一千萬。老天好像厚愛於香港人，星島果然以一對雰告捷，這個千萬金換不來的得勝之球，在開場七分鐘後便踢進青白的球門裏。此後雙方攻守，各無所得。青白之失，其咎似在「用非其材」，全綫不夠完整。</p>
<p>李義臣　　給許竟成釘煞</p>
<p>許文奎原始內鋒的好人材，這次改任左翼，是青白缺少這個角色的原故。費春華的步法不錯，可是足部受傷未愈，戰來極不濟事。青白隊的一雙外翼，既有這些不良狀態，前鋒綫於是有「雁行折翼」之　。羅壽福與高保正，雖是不畏猛虎的初生之犢，但功夫究竟未「老」，沒法支撐陣腳不穩的前鋒綫。「懶牛」李義臣，給許竟成釘着，雖不懶也無能爲力，無怪青白不能威脅星島的大關。青白不致多負，是守衛人員，尤其是一雙後衛的豐工偉績。嚴士鑫與吳祺祥的頭腳工夫，都比前有進步，獲得座上客的好評。秦必高是初到「貴」境的球客，他在這溫和天氣的香港仍穿上了手套。這成了攝球的大障碍，他也不擅接地球，但對高球和衝刺的救護，有相當的把握。</p>
<p>這一球　　是如此失去的</p>
<p>在那七十分鐘的激戰中，青白已失去了他們的「下馬威」，但以後還有三場比賽——十一日對南華，十三日對華聯，十六日對港聯，青白諸將雄心勃勃，也許可以打個勝仗。星島僅以一球之勝，實在也不見的「高強」多少哩。青白哪一個勝敗攸關的球，是這樣失去的：球戰開始，李義臣發動攻勢，星島不就便奪球而前，一時你來我往，速度甚高。打得幾個回合，即見何應芬邊陲猛進，一腳傅中，黎兆榮先取定位置，球來便射，嚴士鑫迎面來左，本從右去的球兒卻擦中士鑫之身反向左飛，秦必高滿擬球向右飛，不道中途改道，於是忙轉身來接，雖然接着，可是球來甚　，因匆忙轉身，卻接的不牢，卒被脫手漏入門內。青白失去了一球，以後使奮力壓倒了星島的攻勢，因此以後調整人馬，改變陣綫，便可有戰勝的希望吧。</p>
<p>優游對猶太　提前明日舉行</p>

<p>The Spring and Autumn Cactus - A Brief Note on a Trip to Yunnan 2 Lin Yongchun</p>
<p>The green cakes, with pointed tops and bottoms connected, have different forms, like inverted tops, stacked Arhats, or oval hand mirrors. Is she admiring her reflection? Is she dabbing her lips? Is she arranging her temples and drawing her eyebrows?</p>
<p>The cakes have needle-like thorns, like nets, like a young woman's coiled hair, like a clear green lake with raindrops dotting it.</p>
<p>In spring, these sturdy green cakes grow small, cup-shaped spheres at their tips, like wine glasses. Are they waiting for sweet dew? Welcoming sweet dew? But the poor villagers, enduring bitterness, pick them and take them to the city to sell them. In that flower-selling paradise of long streets, it is said that they are even considered food, and that those who love wine even eat the wine glasses!</p>
<p>Wild places have many treasures, but it is not precious in the wild. Look: on the roofs, by the earthen embankments, at the edges of the fields... it grows without choosing the soil. It forms walls, thorny fences; it lives together with wildflowers and weeds.</p>
<p>You who love flowers, tend flowers, decorate potted landscapes, and embellish your garden: come here, come and pick these green cakes, and learn the posture of morning makeup!</p>
<h3>Tchaikovsky's Love</h3>
<p>Li Wenxun</p>
<p>The love life of the great Russian musician Tchaikovsky is very interesting, because he was too poor. His teacher, the famous pianist Nikolai Rubinstein, had to ask a wealthy widow named Nadezhda von Meck for help. She was a very eccentric aristocrat, very stubborn and reserved, but there was one thing she couldn't resist - music. Music would make her forget to eat and sleep, as if drunk and enchanted, sometimes making her feel lighthearted, sometimes making her tremble. She sighed and said:</p>
<p>"What kind of magical power is this that makes my whole being collapse..."</p>
<p>Nikolai brought Tchaikovsky's new work "The Tempest" to visit her. She knew that this pianist would not come without a purpose. She smiled and watched him approach the piano, then quickly went inside, as was her old habit, to sit alone in a room and listen to music quietly in the dark... Nikolai began, using his magical fingers to play, and a mysterious land unfolded before her eyes.</p>
<p>When the music ended, Nadezhda appeared, with the rustling sound of her dress. She was breathing heavily with pleasure!</p>
<p>"Who composed it?" she asked softly.</p>
<p>"Tch...ai...kov...sky," Nikolai replied solemnly, "He is a genius."</p>
<p>"You don't need to praise him; his music is enough to explain!"</p>
<p>This wealthy widow, who had eleven children, began to fall in love with Tchaikovsky's music. She asked him, "In the days after hearing your 'The Tempest,' I fell into an uncontrollable sea of unfortunate emotions..."</p>
<p>At this time, the impoverished Tchaikovsky urgently needed money, and also eagerly longed for a kindred spirit. The wealthy widow, who lived a very dry life, also needed a confidante, needed a kind of vitality. Thus, love began.</p>
<p>"Mr. Peter Ilyich; your kind reply gave me the happiness I have longed for for so long... I ask you to give me your photo. If you are unwilling, simply refuse me, do not offer explanations. Explanations frighten me..."</p>
<p>"There was a time when I really wanted to meet you. Now, the more I love you, the less I want to meet you. At present, I would rather enjoy the sweet longing alone, confessing my feelings to you in your music. Your music is my beautiful homeland..."</p>
<p>"The photo you sent has been received, countless thanks. Your photo makes my world and days shine. I would be unspeakably happy if you would allow me to have another new one. I know you don't like taking photos, but since you have decided to take another one, please adopt the same pose! Fix those thoughtful eyes on me, because any man who does not look at me is arrogant, and I don't like it..."</p>
<p>"Yesterday I returned from St. Petersburg, truly unfortunate - I didn't get to hear your opera Vakula the Smith. I must find a way to make up for this loss, so I ask you, Peter, to write me a piece of music that can be heard as sad and disappointed, and even, if you think it appropriate, can still be heard as the sweet breath of death..."</p>
<p>But as a sincere artist, he could not, like a chef, cook delicious dishes according to the diners' tastes. Anything could be careless, but not the faithful belief in art, he said;</p>
<p>"Dear Nadezhda: I am very ashamed that every letter comes with money. Although it is not a disgrace for an artist to receive payment for his work, the kind of music you want me to write requires a kind of awakening called "inspiration," just like any other creation, and this kind of thing does not come at will. I am unwilling to pretend for money, and I do not want to use my skills to pass off fake things as real, but my need for money is so urgent..."</p>
<p>"I am currently busy writing a fourth symphony, and I want to dedicate this piece of music to you..." Tchaikovsky, a bachelor for thirty-seven years, had lost the frivolous habits of his youth, but had fallen into another state of mental unease, perhaps due to physiology. This was originally a fertile piece of land, but now it had become barren. At this time, a young woman named Antonina entered this piece of land, she was young and beautiful, and passionately loved Tchaikovsky... Tchaikovsky carefully and gently told Nadezhda about this.</p>
<p>"Now let me introduce my fiancée! Her name is Antonina Ivanovna Milyukova, she is twenty-eight years old, has a beautiful appearance, a good reputation, is an independent woman, has received secondary education, and is very generous..." After receiving this letter, Nadezhda replied immediately, without any of the sourness of an ordinary woman, maintaining the identity and tone of a generous aristocrat. In this letter, she proposed the ways in which they would communicate in the future, either discussing personal life or focusing on music... Tchaikovsky completely agreed. Nadezhda continued to send him money, even sending him money for the wedding. In October 1877, Nadezhda sent him six thousand rubles, a huge sum that was a tonic for Tchaikovsky. From then on, he could live a quiet life, his full energy filled with music. Nadezhda wrote to him:</p>
<p>"I will give you money, you can write with peace of mind."</p>
<p>Tchaikovsky's fame grew day by day, and he became an authority in the Russian music scene. But in 1890, he unexpectedly received a letter in which Nadezhda proposed that their correspondence could come to an end, without any reason. Tchaikovsky was greatly shocked and almost fell down. They had never met. He had to leave, go to the United States, and hold a concert in Paris, which was unprecedentedly successful and conquered the arrogant music city, but that beautiful love would never return.</p>
<p>Me and the Banana Tree</p>
<p>Yao Peng</p>
<p>When it's late at night, waking up from a dream, I suddenly hear the sound of fine rain outside the window, hitting the banana leaves - the sound is both dense and intimate, like a loving mother's earnest warning, instructing "return early," and like the earnest whispers of children, urging "take care of yourself." Because of the separation and homesickness that are stirred up, I often toss and turn, feeling lost and unable to resolve it all night.</p>
<p>However, in my hometown in the north, there are no banana trees...</p>
<p>And my fondness for banana trees seems to have begun when I was still a very young child. I don't remember exactly how I first had this preconceived idea - sifting through the tangled memories, I remember an ancient painting in my grandfather's study.</p>
<p>Speaking of that painting, I can't help but think of that exquisite and shady study, and at the same time, my grandfather's kind face immediately appears in my memory.</p>
<p>Whoever you are, when you walk into that old house, sit comfortably on that soft chair for a while, facing two pots of half-blooming wintersweet, quiet and serene. In the small incense burner on the desk, an unknown incense is occasionally lit, the fragrance subtle, the light blue smoke rising curlingly, seeming to entrust your ethereal fantasies. Receiving sunlight from the window, watching the fallen flowers rustling in the courtyard - "This is not a place for reading, only for resting." Breathing in the warm and quiet atmosphere all around, just drinking a cup of hot tea, you may feel that you have not only seen this residence, but also understood the owner of this house.</p>
<p>Like many old people, my grandfather also kept a very long beard, moved relatively slowly, didn't like to talk much, was particular about his diet, but didn't pay attention to his clothing at all. - And what made my grandfather somewhat different from other old people was that he didn't have the stubbornness and prejudice that came with old age. He would rather be lonely and lonely himself than force others to follow his opinions. Therefore, the study was his little world. At the same time, in this little world, he did not want to be disturbed in his peaceful thoughts.</p>
<p>However, because of excessive pampering, I often liked to spend time in the study. Of course, I couldn't appreciate the Peiwen Yunfu, let alone the Sanxitang Calligraphy Collection. However, the paper and pens on the desk that I could use freely had already given me great temptation. My grandfather's beloved "Yunzi" chess pieces, black and white, shiny and lustrous, also made me "appreciate" them very much; and what attracted me the most was the paintings on the wall that were often changed, and the many stories that my grandfather told me because of those paintings.</p>
<p>Struggling to climb onto the desk, the olive-shaped papaya, the ox-shaped bronze incense burner, smoking from its ears and nose, the ink box with carved patterns, the bronze paperweight, etc., these were all played with until they were dirty. Even when I felt that "getting Grandpa tobacco" and "trimming Grandpa's beard" were no longer interesting, I would often say -</p>
<p>"Grandpa, tell me a joke, didn't you not finish telling it last time?"</p>
<p>The paintings on the wall were often changed, so my grandfather's stories were also often new. To this day, I can still recall that most of those stories were taken from notebooks like Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio. Of course, the stories and the paintings were completely unrelated, but at that time, I couldn't find anyone else in the family who could tell so many tortuous and subtle stories.</p>
<p>My first impression of "banana tree" was from a painting in my grandfather's study. I guess it was probably a painting of a beautiful woman. A young woman in a light crimson dress was shown from behind, with a rather tall banana tree behind her, green and verdant, with such broad leaves that I was very surprised.</p>
<p>I tried hard to recall that story many times afterwards, but unfortunately I couldn't find any clues. I only vaguely remembered that the banana tree transformed into a person in green clothes. I couldn't remember what happened afterwards - of course, I can only make it up now, but when I think of that vague and beautiful memory, I would rather keep that largely incomplete story and let it live forever in my memory!</p>
<p>After that, for some reason, I always longed to see a real, growing banana tree. The more I couldn't get it, the more I yearned for it, which led me to become a fan of banana trees.</p>
<p>I really saw banana trees only in the past two or three years; at that time, the war was raging; I had just started from Peiping and secretly crossed the confrontation line. The Nationalist army on the Henan front lost, and I also fled west in a panic, passing through Guanzhong, crossing the Qinling Mountains, and wandering into Sichuan. Although I experienced all kinds of hardships, I finally realized my long-cherished wish. On a deep autumn evening, when the trees were bare and the drizzle was continuous, with the heart of a pilgrim, I carried my simple and poor luggage and walked up the stone steps of the mountain city.</p>
<p>The environment was novel and unfamiliar to me, the customs were very different, and I couldn't understand the language. There were so few acquaintances that I could almost say there were none. Sitting alone in a small room, I worried about my future every day, and often hesitated about my life in reality.</p>
<p>It was at this time that I saw the banana tree.</p>
<p>There was one behind the guesthouse, not tall and not green, far less beautiful than I had imagined, but at first sight, it was as if I had met a long-time friend, and I felt an indescribable sense of emotion and joy in my heart. Afterwards, I often closed the door during the day and stayed alone in the bamboo house unique to Chongqing, opened the window, had thick fog in the morning, looked out at the vast Yangtze River, and the banana tree swayed its palms in the wind, just like a good friend was sitting there. Whether I was reading the family letter woven with sorrow and resentment, or writing an article, when I saw it, I seemed to have received infinite comfort in my heart, relieving a lot of sadness and burden on my soul.</p>
<p>I remember that night a guest came from my hometown, braving the rain that had been falling for half a month to visit, and told me the sad news of "Grandfather's death." At that time, the War of Resistance was difficult and my mood was extremely sad and indignant. Suddenly encountering such an accident, I really felt unable to bear it!</p>
<p>And at night, a light rain knocked on the banana leaves - this was no longer an enjoyment for me, it seemed to hit my heart with every sound, chilling my chest and shattering my dreams.</p>
<p>Since then, I have not dared to sit alone in the shade of the banana tree. I no longer count the days hoping for the unfolding of the newly grown leaves. I hate even more the noisy and monotonous sound of the rain hitting the banana tree!</p>
<p>This year, I left Sichuan and moved to this Jiangnan region that also has a lot of rain - but I rarely see banana trees, so I miss them again.</p>
<p>Banana trees symbolize the abundance of southern feelings, the unrestrained vitality. It is not as ancient and frugal as pine and cypress, nor is it as self-admiring as plum blossoms and orchids. It receives wind and rain with a heart that doesn't care, and sends sorrow and resentment to the world indifferently! - I certainly shed tears when I heard the sound of rain hitting the banana tree, but my worries were finally soothed as a result.</p>
<p>Missing the banana tree, I also miss my hometown, which is thousands of miles away and has no banana trees. My grandfather is dead, and I am afraid that my old house no longer exists, and that painting...</p>

<p>Wall Painting Draft</p>
<p>Giotto</p>
<p>Giotto (1267-1337) was originally an ordinary shepherd boy. After Cimabue took him as a student, he progressed very quickly. He also associated with the poet Dante and others, and soon became a famous artist of the time. His style was strict and vibrant. After the age of fifty-eight, he stopped painting and engaged in sculpture and architecture. The existing marble "Giotto Tower" in Florence is his work in his later years. Art historians call him the "progenitor of modern painting," which means that the Italian Renaissance began with him. This sketch has been preserved for so long and is still as good as new, which is especially rare. (Lion)</p>
<p>Poetic Words</p>
<p>Tian Su</p>
<p>Poetry is sometimes like a pool of still water, clear to the bottom, but sometimes like a surging wave; and sometimes, like a narrow stream, flowing around twists and turns, passing jagged rocks, and fragrant flowers and plants.</p>
<p>The Flame of Life</p>
<p>Ye Cao</p>
<p>Just as dawn broke, Li Yitang was already working in the damp and muddy ground.</p>
<p>Using the broken bamboo and wood, tied together with knotted hemp rope, he carefully built a thatched shed, setting up the frame, and slowly spreading the scattered wheat stalks on the roof.</p>
<p>The northwest wind, fierce, blew over from the vast wilderness in gusts, one gust closely following another. White steam came out of Li Huatang's mouth, and his snot and drool froze into ice on his beard. He kept blowing on his ten fingers, which were all cracked.</p>
<p>This is a plain that has only recently receded from the Yellow River flood, an area scoured by the flood, a piece of yellow mud, with no grass, trees, or villages visible for dozens of miles around. This midsummer, when the Yellow River breached its banks, Li Huatang and his family of three were rescued by a lifeboat to an earthen embankment that had not been washed away, where they lived for two or three months.</p>
<p>A few days ago, Li Huatang, barefoot, walked on the muddy ground next to his residence, which had lost its boundaries, measuring the portion he was entitled to. Then he used an iron shovel to mark the boundaries, and within the boundaries, he sowed wheat seeds, sowing his hope, hoping for a bumper harvest next spring.</p>
<p>He worked, and a hint of innate indomitable smile appeared on his old and wrinkled face. This piece of land was the inheritance of his ancestors. Before the house was washed away, generations of his family had lived here, full of joy and warmth. He had spent a happy childhood here.</p>
<p>Bundle after bundle of wheat straw were placed on the roof of the shed, flattened, and supported again and again. His wife sorted the messy wheat straw, handing him one bundle after another, which he carefully took and spread on the roof.</p>
<p>"If only Da'er (eldest son) was at home!..." the woman suddenly said.</p>
<p>"Why mention him!"</p>
<p>Li Huatang interrupted his wife's sigh, gently and mildly, without any malice. The eldest son had been a soldier for ten years, and although he often sent letters, he had not yet returned home. The woman thought of the eldest son whenever something happened, but Li Huatang did not miss him as much. He felt that he was not old, he wanted to live! He still had the courage to support his family.</p>
<p>No matter what, on the land left by his ancestors, the muddy ground where the house had once stood still had to be rebuilt with a house, even if it was a thatched shed. It was always built by his own hands, and he would be content as long as he could shelter from the wind and rain, and he would feel unspeakable joy.</p>
<p>"Old man, get a fire going!"</p>
<p>The woman handed the flint and tinder to Li Huatang, saying this. He took it and struck a light, then handed it to his wife. The woman ordered her fifteen-year-old son to replace her work, lighting a fire under the makeshift stove.</p>
<p>She poured the soybean cakes that had just been chopped on the embankment from her pocket into the iron pot, and added half a ladle of water. The wind was strong, and the woman squatted on the ground, shivering, her hair disheveled. She had not washed for more than three months. When the fire went out, she knelt by the stove and blew on the unextinguished embers, blowing again and again.</p>
<p>Her eyes were tearing from the wind and smoke. She didn't seem to feel anything, just wiped it off and continued to blow the fire. She lifted the pot lid, and a fragrant soybean aroma rushed into her nostrils. She knew it was almost ready. These soybean cakes used to be used to feed pigs or as fertilizer, but now, they were their only food! And they could only eat it once a day.</p>
<p>After the flood, they didn't have much surplus grain, so they exchanged it for cheap soybean cakes to eat gradually, waiting quietly for the wheat season next spring.</p>
<p>The roof of the shed was finished, and the soybean cakes were cooked. Li Huatang stopped his work and squatted on the ground, eating with his wife and children.</p>
<p>"Dad, why don't you put some salt in the pot?" the little son asked.</p>
<p>"Tsk, silly child!" Li Huatang chuckled, "When I was little, our family often didn't eat salt for two or three months every year!"</p>

<p>Chen Yuanyuan, courtesy name Guofen, her original family name was Xing, raised in the Chen family, so she adopted the surname Chen. She was Wu Sangui's wife. Wu led the Qing army into the customs and was made Prince of Pingxi. He wanted Yuanyuan to be his official wife, but she declined. Knowing that Wu harbored rebellious intentions, she asked to become a female Taoist. When Wu rebelled, Yuanyuan advised him not to listen, so she followed Zen Master Yulin to Hongjue Temple, shaved her head to become a Buddhist nun, named Jingjing, and styled herself Yü-an. When the Qing army pacified Yunnan, Yuanyuan threw herself into the Lotus Pond and died, buried next to the Shangshan Temple, as recorded in Mr. Yinguo's Compilation of Chen Yuanyuan's Affairs. After I arrived in Yunnan, I lived near the Lotus Pond at Southwest Associated University. I often took walks along the pond with friends, so I used a Shakespearean sonnet to praise Yuanyuan.</p>
<p>Treating the ancient temple as a deep boudoir,</p>
<p>And the sacred altar as a dressing table,</p>
<p>The ancient well is the mirror when you do your morning makeup,</p>
<p>And your slender hands are your comb.</p>
<p>Let loneliness seal up your glorious years,</p>
<p>In the dead of night, you kneel before the gods,</p>
<p>Murmuring the scriptures under the dim lamp;</p>
<p>Hoping that the iron tree will never bloom or bear fruit,</p>
<p>The lonely years melt away like flowing water.</p>
<p>The wind of the plateau takes away your dreams of beauty,</p>
<p>Waking up in the middle of the night, sighing that past events are like dreams.</p>
<p>Far away in the north, there are lonely rabbits running everywhere,</p>
<p>It is hateful that Wu Sangui's heart is dark, without a soul.</p>
<p>Oh, the boat is cold on Wuhua Mountain at night</p>
<p>(In the deep of the clear night, you quietly threw yourself into the water of the Lotus Pond to die).</p>
<p>One inch of mountain and river, one inch of blood.</p>

<p>Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>Tsurumi rarely spoke, he tried his best to enjoy the warmth given to him by Mrs. Koyuan and Kikuyo. He knew that the more he could receive their supplies, compared to saying some sweet words, the more he could make them feel satisfied.</p>
<p>Because Tsurumi was used to sitting in chairs in China, he automatically moved from the kneeling cushion to the only small soft chair in the corner of the room after eating a bit. This action again provided Mrs. Koyuan and her daughter with a lot of material for jokes. They both maintained this quiet warmth until Tsurumi had enough to drink, and ate a bowl of home-style rice and fish noodles cooked by Mrs. Koyuan herself, which he hadn't eaten for many years. While Tsurumi smoked cigarettes and drank green tea, Mrs. Koyuan and Kikuko asked a question or two while observing his expression:</p>
<p>"Do the Chinese still like to talk so loudly?" ... "Do they still spit everywhere?" ... "Do they still eat several large bowls in one meal, like a rice-eating competition?" ... "Are the officials still so fond of money?" ... "Do the businessmen still cheat people like that?" ... "Are the common people still so afraid of the rice people?" ... "Do they still only take a bath two or three times a year?" , ... "Sneezing at people? ... Coughing in people's faces? ... Yawning at people and still shouting loudly? ... Do tailors still have to shorten the new clothes of customers, leaving cloth behind for their families to make trousers?..."</p>
<p>The attitude of the mother and daughter when asking these questions was mostly joking, entertaining, and fun, not very serious. Tsurumi also dealt with them in an entertaining manner. Finally, Mrs. Koyuan took a vigilant breath and mentioned the war going on at the moment. "Another war with China, I'm afraid my son's brother will have to be drafted again... I don't know why they have to fight? ... Is there no other way to solve the China problem?..."</p>
<p>Tsurumi smiled and said, "If there is no war, how can we soldiers make merit? Without merit, we can't become high officials and hold great power!" He was deliberately teasing.</p>
<p>"Brother Wang," Kikuko softly inserted into the conversation, "War will kill many people. There are fewer people in our country, and several times more Chinese people. Isn't it very uneconomical?"</p>
<p>"China has no weapons. Our weapons are many and good. Isn't it a pity not to use them? ... Besides, with good weapons, the loss of people will be less, won't it?"</p>
<p>"Although the weapons are good, you shouldn't kill people!" Mrs. Koyuan felt that fighting was too cruel. "Your uncle used to say: 'Killing a thousand, harming eight hundred!' This calculation doesn't make sense."</p>
<p>"Even if the calculation doesn't make sense, this is a matter of national importance. I am just a small soldier, and I don't understand it very well!"! Seeing that he was unwilling to continue these annoying questions, he took out the "national affairs" tiger head card to cut off the problem.</p>
<p>"Kikuko" Mrs. Koyuan knew that Tsurumi didn't like to talk about this kind of thing, and didn't want to nag anymore and make Tsurumi annoyed, so she warned Kikuko, "Have you forgotten something?" Kikuko smiled at her mother, nodded again, and said to herself, "Wait a little longer, I'm afraid it will delay Brother Wang's affairs!" As she spoke, she took out a small cloth clip from her sleeve, opened it and took out a small piece of paper, and said to Tsurumi, "Brother, I have been entrusted by someone to keep this piece of paper and publish it to you when possible..." She paused as she spoke, looking at Tsurumi's face.</p>
<p>"It doesn't matter... I have slept enough now, drunk enough, eaten enough, and talked a lot, this is my purpose for coming here. Is there anything? Can you tell me now? ... But I am very grateful to you and my aunt for treating me and sympathizing with me so kindly."</p>
<p>Poetry Record of Returning Home</p>
<p>Lu Baihua</p>
<p>Passing Qingfeng Ridge</p>
<p>Because of the haste of my return, I had to cross the river to the east. It was still very dark, and Zong'en had already hailed two rickshaws, waiting at the entrance of the Qingtai Hotel. It seemed that only the rolling sound of these two carts was pulling towards the river under the still hanging street lights, pulling past the drum tower in the style of a barrier, followed by a long embankment. I was surprised that I had never taken this road before, so desolate, around the embankment, with broken walls and tiles, leaving behind the remains of foxes and rats. The river was also in sight. Because we had to catch the first bus to Cao'e, we had to "cross privately" before the people crossing the river. As the ferry crossed the vast river waves, the faint morning light gradually spread out. Although it was only a few minutes of "ferry" time, it made me feel that crossing the river was the same as boating on the lake, with a kind of pleasure.</p>
<p>Eight years ago, the journey home could be reached in one day, and there were long-distance buses connected by Xiaoshao to meet people at the river crossing. Now, after the destruction of the magic hand, the section from Cao'e to Sanjie cannot be connected. Apart from speculative chartered cars, there are only rickshaws, and rickshaws stopped at Cao'e Station, and there happened to be chartered cars soliciting passengers. Combining seventy thousand yuan, we could leave in ten minutes. But these kinds of cars were too worn out to bear. It was really impossible to drive to Bujiang halfway. There was still half a road from Xiaojiang to Sanjie, so what to do? We wandered outside a gate, staring blankly at the desolate river, when a chartered car came behind us, honking. The person in the car greeted me. It turned out to be the captain of a certain air force team, who had bravely bombed Longhua while flying a plane. Now he was returning home in glory. Coincidentally, we were from the same hometown. This solved the siege. His car was much better, and he chartered it all the way from the riverside to Sheng County. Following the ups and downs of the mountains, the car drove up to the towering cliffs. Below was the stream. The branches of the jungle flew past the car window. I looked up at a towering pavilion on the top of the cliff, knowing that we had reached Qingfeng Ridge.</p>
<p>Qingfeng Ridge and Cao'e River are both ancient sites in eastern Zhejiang, and they have drawn a tragic page of history. However, I thought that Cao'e was a filial daughter, and Qingfeng was a chaste woman, one filial to her father, and the other chaste to her country. It is not easy to be chaste to one's country. She was captured by the Yuan soldiers at the end of the Song Dynasty. Passing over the ridge, knowing the shame, and with the anger and hatred of the country's demise and the family's destruction intertwined with the powerless heart of a weak woman, she dipped her blood and wrote a poem, then jumped off the cliff and died. The last sentence of the poem, "It is sad to both survive and perish!", how much does it contain the decline of the family and the country! And it moves people thousands of years later today.</p>

<p>Ibsen wrote a book "A Doll's House", which spoke out the words that women dared not say in their hearts, and thus became the women's movement at the end of the 19th and early 20th centuries. After this book was published, many women went to his residence crying and thanking him, but Ibsen waved his hands and hurriedly said, "No need to thank me, no need to thank me, this is just a script I wrote!"</p>

<p>National Capital</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of determining the capital, the debate between Nanjing and Peiping resulted in a victory for those advocating Peiping as the capital by a majority of 117 votes to 63 in the National Assembly's draft constitution review meeting yesterday.</p>
<p>This is just a preliminary stipulation in the draft constitution. It is still uncertain whether it will be passed in the comprehensive review meeting in the future, and whether it can be passed three times in the plenary session.</p>
<p>However, such news is enough to stimulate both Peiping and Nanjing. Everyone think about it, what kind of changes will there be in the real estate in these two places?</p>

<p>News Data</p>
<p>Sixty-Three-Year-Old Woman Turns into a Man After Death</p>
<p>Zheng Fan</p>
<p>A strange story was published in the newspaper: Mrs. Molly, an old lady from New Zealand who was already sixty-three years old, recently passed away in Duayashire, and suddenly it was discovered that "she" was originally a thorough man. This Mr. Mori not only dressed as a woman all his life, but also married a man. Such news does seem strange and weird to hear, so let's just "listen" to it. What was the motive of this Mr. Mori? The telegram does not provide details, so there is no way to investigate, but there is no doubt that he has a physiological and psychological abnormality. In sexual psychology, this type of sexual perversion of "men dressing as women" and "women dressing as men" is called "eonism."</p>
<p>Not Lacking Precedents</p>
<p>Eon was a noble youth from France in the 18th century, who served in the French diplomatic world during the reign of Louis XV. He finally died in London. In London, everyone thought he was a woman, and it was not until after his death during the autopsy that it was discovered that he was completely male.</p>
<p>In fact, this kind of eonism is a very common perversion, but most people hide this perversion deep in their hearts and do not show it much. Usually, a man's "femininity," twisting and turning when walking, being shy, having a strong sense of vanity, and being sensitive, these phenomena are enough to explain the prevalence of eonism. It is also very common for women to desire to imitate the temperament and attitude of men and like to wear men's clothing.</p>
<p>The more civilized the country, the easier it is to have this kind of thing. Generally speaking, men or women with eonism often act abnormally, almost to the point of madness, men fantasizing about pregnancy, women fantasizing about marrying wives, but in terms of spirit, they often exceed ordinary people and may become outstanding artists, writers, or politicians.</p>
<p>Sexual Perversion</p>
<p>This kind of perverted psychology may be inherited from the father or mother to his children, slightly presenting nervousness, or having a temperament that is out of balance. Significant perversions only account for a very small part of people, so the matter of Mori dressing as a woman all his life is indeed rare.</p>
<p>Sexual psychology perversions can sometimes affect physiology, with perverted places in physiological structure and function; for example, men's nipples are particularly large, women's larynges are particularly developed, or men's voices are sharp and shrill, while women's voices are completely male. In terms of physiology alone, there may also be perversions in both men and women. It is often said in legends that "a woman feels different while sleeping, and wakes up to find she has become a man," or "a man has a serious illness, and after recovering from the illness, he suddenly gradually turns into a woman." However, true and certain things seem to be rarely encountered. In the twenty-fourth year of the Republic of China, there was a woman from Qing County named Yao Jinping who, because she missed her father so much, fell ill in a small building and fell into a coma. Suddenly, she heard thunder circling above her head, and with a bang, she actually changed her hairpin for a hat in an instant. When she came to Shanghai, she immediately caused a sensation throughout the city, and people from all walks of life flocked to visit her. As a result, doctors from the National Shanghai Medical College forcibly examined her and found that she was still a daughter and had no perversion at all. It is said that because she wanted to go to Xinjiang to find her father, she was afraid that women would have many inconveniences when traveling far away, so she had no choice but to come up with this strange idea. The mystery was revealed, and medical scientists and news reporters wasted a lot of pen and ink, which was truly hilarious.</p>
<p>Possible Things</p>
<p>Of course, true female-to-male and male-to-female transformations are possible. In 1909, Professor Brauer found five discoveries in history. The reason is nothing more than the role of hormones in the adrenal membrane, but the detailed content is still a mystery to this day.</p>
<p>"Purposeful" disguise is often seen. Just last month, there was a young white Russian boy in Qingdao named Filianafu who disguised himself as a dancing girl and actually went to sea to accompany dances. His glamorous name spread far and wide, and he defrauded a lot of U.S. dollars. Later, he was identified by the local military police, and his trick was exposed, and he was arrested and imprisoned. There are many, many other similar incidents, which are not within the scope of this article, so I will not "cite extensively."</p>
<p>I believe that psychologists and medical scientists will give us more accurate and satisfactory answers in the near future.</p>

<h3>Wu Suiren Indictment: Embezzlement of 2.7 Billion Constitutes Suspicion of Corruption</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Wu Suiren, head of the Cashier Section of the General Affairs Department of the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (ERR), embezzled 2.7 billion yuan. The District Prosecutor's Office concluded its investigation after a month. The handling prosecutor, Liu Yongzhi, believed that Wu Suiren, using his authority over cashier matters, misappropriated public funds for direct personal gain. Although he returned all the embezzled public funds with interest after the incident, it did not help his completed act of direct personal gain. Therefore, he was prosecuted under Article 3, Paragraph 6 of the Regulations on the Punishment of Corruption: "Those who directly or indirectly seek personal gain in matters under their supervision or management shall be sentenced to death, life imprisonment, or imprisonment for not less than seven years." The full text of the indictment is as follows:</p>
<p>Wu Suiren, male, 40 years old, residing at No. 2, Ruifengli, Dongjia Road, North Sichuan Road, serving as the head of the Cashier Section of the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned defendant is suspected of corruption (Case No. 53250, Zhenjiazi, Year 35). The investigation has been completed, and it is deemed that prosecution is warranted. The facts of the crime, evidence, and the applicable laws are listed as follows:</p>
<p>Wu Suiren has served as the head of the Cashier Section of the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration for many years, in charge of the ERR's cashier duties, holding significant responsibility for the receipt and expenditure of public funds. The ERR entrusted him with utmost sincerity. However, the defendant was recently</p>
<p>Blinded by Greed, taking advantage of the power and opportunity of his position as the head of the department to seek direct personal gain. On October 22 of this year, the Nanjing Cashier Section of the ERR transferred a sum of 2.7 billion yuan in national currency to the Shanghai Cashier Section of the ERR through the Nanjing Branch of the Central Bank of China, which was noted to be the funding for the Joint Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (JRRA) in September, allocated as an advance payment to the ERR. The national treasury allocated the funds to the Nanjing office, which then transferred them to the recipient bank via the Central Bank. The payee was listed as the Cashier Section of the General Affairs Department of the ERR. On October 24, the remittance arrived at the Shanghai Central Bank. After receiving notification, the defendant went to Shanghai alone the next day (October 25)</p>
<p>Central Bank to Withdraw Funds, with a single signature and voucher. He also had the Central Trust Bureau Trust Department endorse and note "Receive Payee's Account." After the Central Bank exchange officer verified that the procedures were correct, he approved the full amount of the remittance to be delivered in the form of Central Trust Bureau cashier's checks, which the defendant directly received in full. At that time, the details of the exchange and payment were not reported to the ERR's supervisors, nor were the director of the Finance Department or the director of the Accounting Office notified. The defendant dared to secretly transfer this huge sum of money and privately entrusted friends to make loans to seek high profits, as high as 14% or 15%. A portion of the funds, totaling 100 million yuan, was lent out or used by the defendant himself, while 1 billion yuan remained unused. Subsequently, the ERR received a telegram from the Nanjing office informing them that the funds had been remitted and ordering an investigation and report on the receipt of funds. The relevant director interrogated the defendant after investigating the receipt of funds. The defendant knew that the matter was exposed and could not be concealed, so he confessed the process of privately withdrawing public funds for personal gain through loans and promised to</p>
<p>Recover the Principal and Interest and return it to the treasury. The ERR believed that he, as the cashier, had misappropriated public funds for personal gain and should be dismissed from his post and sent to the authorities for investigation according to the law. This office secretly detained the defendant. After several interrogations, the defendant admitted to misappropriating public funds for personal gain and stated that the principal and interest had been fully returned to the ERR. This was verified with the ERR and the Central Bank's replies, confirming that the full amount of 2.7 billion yuan had been recovered in installments: 1.1 billion yuan on October 31, 600 million yuan on November 4, 100 million yuan on November 6, 900 million yuan on November 7, and 14.6 million yuan in interest on November 14. The funds were handed over by Wu Suiren that day in his capacity as the head of the Cashier Section, bearing the seal of Wu Suiren of the Cashier Section. The defendant's claim that he personally withdrew the funds and returned them is credible. In summary, the defendant Wu Suiren, taking advantage of his position and authority, misappropriated public funds for his own direct profit in matters under his management of the cashier’s office.</p>
<p>The Evidence is Clear. Although all the misappropriated public funds, including principal and interest, were returned to the treasury after the incident, this does not affect his completed act of direct personal gain. Therefore, whether the defendant actually profited or not is irrelevant. Based on past judgments and interpretations, the defendant's actions constitute a violation of Article 3, Paragraph 6 of the Regulations on the Punishment of Corruption, without any doubt. Prosecution should be initiated in accordance with Article 230, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law.</p>
<h3>Municipal Council General Assembly Approaching; Half-Li Section of Road Awaiting Repair</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Municipal Council's second general assembly is scheduled to be held at Zhengshi Middle School on Anhe Temple Road on January 6 of next year. However, a bumpy and uneven section of the road leading to the school, about half a li in length and consisting of mud, poses a considerable inconvenience to vehicle traffic. Therefore, a special request has been made to the Municipal Government and the school to negotiate and carry out minor repairs, including applying asphalt. It is now understood that the Municipal Government Standing Committee may be responsible for the labor costs of repairing this section of the road, but it hopes that Zhengshi Middle School can bear the cost of materials. Secretary-General Xiang of the Municipal Council is currently in contact with the authorities regarding this matter.</p>
<h3>Puppet Township Chief of Qingpu County, Zou Baoxian, and Five Others, Massacre Fifteen Lives, Fall Guy Chen Amu Reveals the Truth, Bereaved Family Members Painfully Recount the Ordeal</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Zou Shixian, the puppet township chief of Xi'an Township, Qingpu County, who is accused of massacring fifteen lives, along with Xue Shunde, Chen Amu, Yang Ada, and Yu Kesheng, were brought to trial at the High Court yesterday morning. The defendants present were Zou Shixian and Chen Amu; the remaining three defendants, Xue Shunde, Yang Ada, and Yu Kesheng, were absent. Many family members of the victims, including Gu Nianlin and Cui Changxi, supported by the old and leading the young, recounted the details of the massacre in court and distributed a leaflet titled "A Tearful Plea for Justice," signed by plaintiffs Gu Nianlin, Cui Changxi, Hua Youren, Liu Guhong, Meng Er Ma, Gu Nianfu, Jiang Wang Shi, Ji Liu Shi, Liu Zhu Shi, Zhou Xiao Yazi, and others. The leaflet describes the details of the victims’ experience in great detail. When questioned, the defendants denied the charges. The court stated that the case was still under investigation and adjourned the hearing to a later date.</p>
<p>According to the family members of the victims, they were originally from Northern Jiangsu and came to Jiangnan by boat during the period of occupation to make a living. On the sixteenth day of the first month of the lunar calendar last year, their small boat was anchored near the old Zhaihe River in Xiaoyin Township, Xi'an Township, in the fifth district of Qingpu County. The victims, including Huang Gu Shi and sixteen others, agreed to go ashore to collect grass. On the way, they encountered Yang Ada and other local villagers, which led to an argument. The puppet township chief Zou Shixian, puppet Bao chief Xue Shunde, and others then led thirty to forty villagers armed with carrying poles and rakes,</p>
<p>Surrounding and Viciously Beating the Victims. Zhou Liu was beaten to death on the spot. Except for Liu Xiao Erzi, who escaped, the remaining fourteen people were tied up. At night, the puppet township chief Zou Shixian and others, without any humanity, cruelly killed all fourteen members of the Bao Gu Shi family, including men, women, the old and the young. The case was reported to the puppet Qingpu County government on March 3 of last year by the families of the victims. The puppet county magistrate, Huang Liewen, took bribes publicly and allowed the murderers to be released on bail and ordered the families of the victims to sign an agreement, receive 100,000 yuan in puppet currency as compensation, and leave the territory within a specified period. At the time, they were forced by the enemy and puppet forces and had no way to seek redress. Now, the High Procuratorate has filed a public prosecution on charges of treason and murder. They deeply hope that the murderers can be brought to justice as soon as possible so that the wronged souls of the victims can rest in peace in the afterlife.</p>
<p>The defendant Zou Shixian, wearing a long robe, claimed to have worked underground. He alleged that the victims were robbers who were killed in the course of robbery in his jurisdiction, but he did not give the order and claimed to be unaware of the other circumstances. The second defendant, Chen Amu, testified during the previous hearing that he was forty-two years old, but yesterday suddenly claimed to be twenty-six years old. When questioned, he stated that he was indeed twenty-six years old and that the perpetrator of the crime was his cousin, the township chief of Xiaoyin Township, who had ordered him to be a fall guy. At this point, the court stated that the case was complex and required further investigation and adjourned the hearing to a later date.</p>
<h3>Puppet Bao Chief Sun Wenbin Speaks in Full Respect, Addressing the Court as "Your Honor"</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Sun Wenbin, the puppet Bao chief of Pingmin Village in Zhabei District, was sued by Yang Jie, a representative of the citizens of the 32nd District, for abusing the power of the enemy and puppets, stealing public property, and oppressing civilians. The High Court held a hearing yesterday afternoon. Those present in court were mostly rural people, and the phrase "Reporting to Your Honor" was constantly heard. First, the accuser Yang Jie described Sun’s crimes while serving as puppet Bao chief, and then the witnesses Bian Jingxin, Ding Laotaipo, Lu Huaicheng, and Yan Kerong were summoned. When questioned, Sun Wenbin denied stealing public property and receiving 150,000 yuan in puppet currency from Ding Laotaipo. The court ordered a postponement of the hearing, and the defendant was remanded in custody.</p>

<h3>Current Residents of Enemy and Puppet Houses Petition for the Preservation of Rental Rights</h3>
<p>The second batch of enemy and puppet houses in this city to be auctioned includes twelve units such as No. 181, Fuxiang Lane, Wusong Road, and Minhang Road. The Central Trust Bureau notified the current tenants of each unit to move out within one month after the auction, causing panic among the tenants, who fear being displaced. Therefore, representatives Chen Heng, Zou Qichou, and eight others were publicly elected yesterday and called on Mayor Wu at 11:00 a.m. to request that current tenants' rental rights be preserved after the auction of each unit. The mayor was out on official business, so Secretary-General He met with them on his behalf and expressed sympathy for the difficulty of the tenants in moving out, promising to relay the matter to Mayor Wu and maintain the principle of preserving the rental rights of the original tenants. The representatives were satisfied and are now awaiting a reasonable resolution.</p>

<h3>Reader Consultation, Legal Questions</h3>
<p>(1) Illegal Sale of Property</p>
<p>Sun Jiping asks: A, B, and C jointly owned a courtyard house in Hangzhou before the war, which was inherited from their ancestors. Since 1937, the house has been under the care of D (because A, B, and C were away). Two or three years after Hangzhou fell into enemy hands, D, without the consent of A, B, and C, sold the house to Han for 60,000 yuan. Han then sold it to Jin for 120,000 yuan, who in turn sold it to the traitor Yu for more than 300,000 yuan. After the victory, the authorities arrested Jin. It is said that Yu had already fled upon hearing the news. The house is now sealed by the Central Trust Bureau, and it is rumored that there are bids for tens of millions of yuan. B and C have not yet returned to Zhejiang, and A unfortunately died of illness during the war. Now, A's son has returned to Zhejiang from the inland and learned of the above situation after meeting with D. Now, A's son wants to reclaim the property rights. Please advise: (1) Can A's son reclaim the property rights on behalf of B and C? (2) Is there any hope of recovering the house if a lawsuit is filed according to law? (3) According to Article... of the Civil Code, "Common property without the consent of the co-owners," is it effective to file a lawsuit? Are there other similar clauses that can be used for an effective lawsuit? (4) Are there any other important procedures to be followed when recovering the property? Is it practically difficult?</p>
<p>"Lawyer Cao Yaxia Answers" (1) No. (However, if A's son has legally inherited his father A's property, he can claim co-ownership. Or B and C can authorize him to exercise the ownership rights on their behalf.) (2) There is hope. (3) Effective. In addition, Article 758 of the Civil Code stipulates that the acquisition, establishment, and alteration of real property rights through legal acts shall not take effect unless registered. (4) File a lawsuit with the court to confirm that the sale of the land is invalid and submit a statement to the agency managing enemy and puppet property.</p>
<p>(2) Female Party Breaks Engagement</p>
<p>Feng Yibin asks: I have several questions regarding a marriage dispute, please answer: (1) Is a marriage contract established by parents' orders and matchmakers' words, without the consent of the parties involved, legally binding? (2) The male party was unable to hold the scheduled wedding with his fiancée due to military service. Now the female party has fled to another place and refuses to fulfill the marriage contract. Is she guilty of obstructing the marriage of a conscript? (3) The female party's family falsely accuses the male party of abandonment. What should be the legal response? (4) If there is proof that the female party is being deliberately hidden by her mother's family to pursue other intentions, can a lawsuit be filed with the court to seek compensation from her mother's family for losses? (5) If the male party is willing to abandon this marriage, can a notice of termination of the marriage contract be published? (6) If the marriage contract is not terminated, can the male party engage or marry another person, or does it constitute bigamy?</p>
<p>"Lawyer Cao Yaxia Answers" (1) It violates Article 972 of the Civil Code, which stipulates that "marriage contracts should be established by the parties themselves," and is naturally invalid; (2) The marriage contract is fundamentally invalid, so there is naturally no violation of the "Regulations on the Protection of the Marriages of Soldiers Conscripted for Resistance against the Enemy"; (3) The charge of abandonment cannot be established; (4) When a marriage contract is terminated, the innocent party may seek compensation from the guilty party for the losses suffered as a result. (5) Yes. (6) (A) Cannot engage or marry another person. (B) Does not constitute bigamy.</p>

<h3>Supply Continues to Dwindle, Demand Continues to Boom, Gold and Banknotes Both Reach New High Prices, Gold Exceeds 3 Million Mark, US Dollar Black Market Rises to 5,700</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Yesterday, rumors were even more rampant, and buying interest revived, causing prices to rise again. The morning opened at 2.905 million. In the first session, it was inevitably succumbed by pressure and hovered, once retreating to around 2.895 million before stabilizing again. When the 2.90 million mark was broken, people's confidence returned. After 10 a.m., the Central Bank supplied 400 bars at a price of 2.9125 million. Afterwards, sellers gathered again, and speculators echoed, and the Central Bank's supply gradually retreated. Thus, at noon, it jumped to around 2.965 million. In the afternoon, overnight delivery surged even more, finally soaring to around 3.01 million, a sharp increase of 113,000 compared to the previous closing. Gold jewelry hung high at 316,000. Silver bullion and silver dollars remained unchanged. Secret interbank lending was flat, and secret interest rates remained between 12% and 15%.</p>
<p>Foreign Exchange Only Advances, No Retreat. The US dollar started at 5,250 yuan in the morning and continued to climb, reaching around 5,600 yuan at noon. After 5 p.m., it continued to rise to 5,700 yuan, an increase of more than 400 yuan compared to the previous day. Hong Kong dollars were in short supply, and finally soared to over 1,150 yuan, with a wide gap between buying and selling prices, a sharp increase of 110 yuan. Hong Kong exchange had buyers but no sellers, finally closing at 1,100 yuan. Indian exchange was 1,340 yuan, and British exchange was 17,501 yuan. The situation was too chaotic, so the volume of transactions decreased.</p>
<p>Factors Contributing to the Rise of the US Dollar</p>
<p>There are many rumors about the reasons for the rise of the US dollar, and no one can agree on one. This reporter specially visited economic experts. According to them, there are several reasons for the recent rise in the US dollar:</p>
<p>(1) After the promulgation of the new trade control measures, the approval and sale of foreign exchange came to a standstill for a time, and the supply was interrupted, so the US dollar took the opportunity to rise.</p>
<p>(2) Recently, there have been many American ships arriving in Shanghai, and some importers, due to the lack of foreign exchange, have had to seek US dollars to make up for it. The most active purchasers this time are the importers.</p>
<p>(3) The International Bank is about to announce the exchange rates of various countries. It was previously rumored that December would be the key to the final decision on our country's exchange rate, and generally sensitive speculators are taking the opportunity to absorb US dollars and raise prices.</p>
<p>(4) Money from other ports poured into Shanghai, causing the Shanghai financial industry's capital position to loosen. And with the approach of the end of the year, the avenues for consumption are narrow. Seeing the US dollar trending strong, they rushed to buy it, which is also a major reason for stimulating the price increase.</p>
<p>(5) Recently, the Central Bank has not adopted an active policy to suppress gold prices, which has aroused suspicion among the general public, who believe that gold and banknotes have a bright future. Optimists are actively buying in to wait for changes. This is another aspect of speculative psychology, which is enough to promote fluctuations in the price of banknotes.</p>
<p>No Basis for Issuing New Banknotes</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is rumored in the market that the Central Bank is about to issue large-denomination banknotes and that the exchange rate will be adjusted again. This reporter also visited various relevant authorities to inquire about the truth of the rumors.</p>
<p>According to Liang Ping, Director of the Issuance Bureau of the Central Bank, he had not heard of the Central Bank issuing new banknotes with huge denominations, and the Central Bank authorities had not considered such measures. Therefore, this rumor is completely groundless and lacks any factual basis.</p>
<p>Although the rumor of adjusting the exchange rate is spreading more and more, according to the observations of authoritative observers, given the current situation, there seems to be no need to adjust the exchange rate in terms of facts and timing. The government authorities have recently promulgated revised import and export trade measures, and the government's intention to strengthen the control of import trade in order to save our country's foreign exchange resources has been clearly demonstrated. After the implementation of the new trade measures, the past phenomenon of various sectors placing orders abroad, which resulted in a huge outflow of foreign exchange, can gradually be corrected. Since the pressure on foreign exchange resources has eased, there is no need to consider adjusting the exchange rate again. Moreover, based on the last time the exchange rate was adjusted, the general price level followed suit, and the rate of increase even exceeded the rate of adjustment of the exchange rate. As a result, the extent of the harm was even greater than keeping the exchange rate unchanged. Therefore, unless there is a special need, the government will not rashly make such an adjustment that is not worth the risk.</p>
<h3>Government Bonds Remain Stagnant</h3>
<p>Government bonds remained stagnant yesterday. Unified C was bought in Room 552, starting at 1,150 yuan in the morning and gradually rising to 230 yuan before stabilizing, an increase of 80 yuan compared to the previous closing. A and B rose by 50 yuan, D fell by 10 yuan, and Unified E remained flat. The transaction volume was over one million yuan.</p>
<h3>Rice Market Continues to Weaken</h3>
<p>Over 7,000 piculs of rice arrived in the north and south markets, forming a situation of weak arrivals and weak sales. The market trend remained sluggish and difficult to improve. Northern and Southern japonica rice continued to see a decline of 300-500 yuan. Glutinous rice softened accordingly. White japonica rice trading was slack, and customer demand was stagnant. Flour fell by 100-200 yuan. Bran removal was not smooth. Soybean cakes made slight progress in Taiwan, with no change in price. Soybeans moved slightly in oil factories and Taiwan. Northeastern soybeans rose by 300-500 yuan. Central Plains soybeans were temporarily inactive. Tea beans continued to progress in Southeast Asia, rising by another 1,000 yuan. Sesame seeds were stable. Raw peanuts in Guangfang were picked up at high prices. The market remained in a state of high prices, weak sales, and stagnation. Corn from Qingdao continued to be in high demand, with arrivals unable to meet sales, and prices gradually increased, becoming higher and more stable. Peanut oil in Shantou remained slow to sell, and market prices showed little change. Soybean oil trade at shops was acceptable, and the situation became firmer, slightly increasing by 1,000-2,000 yuan. Tung oil from Hankou and Chongqing continued to arrive, and the market was stable.</p>
<h3>Deposit Reserve Ratio Approved for Reduction by Ministry of Finance</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The deposit reserve ratio that commercial banks and firms in this city deposit with the Central Bank was originally 20% for demand deposits and 15% for time deposits. The Central Bank has now received approval from the Ministry of Finance to reduce the deposit reserve ratio by 5% for each type. The revised ratio is 15% for demand deposits and 10% for time deposits. The Central Bank has already notified each bank and firm to take note. It is reported that if each bank and firm has already deposited according to the old fixed ratio, the balance can be refunded according to the new ratio.</p>
<h3>Yarn Market Tired Due to Abundance of Chips</h3>
<p>The yarn market cannot be revitalized. Because the resale of subsidized yarn of 1,500 pieces to merchants has been resolved, the cotton yarn with the chips is increasingly abundant, and is piled high everywhere. The bill collectors pursue the silver bills, and are hawking everywhere in the market. 20-count yarn continues to slightly lower by 30,000-40,000, and yarn above 32-count is even more difficult to sell. With little demand, finished products from textile mills are difficult to promote, and they have no intention of adding raw materials.</p>
<h3>Impacted by Rising Gold Prices, Rayon Factories Turn to Raise Prices</h3>
<p>The rayon market was still sluggish yesterday morning, but it slightly stabilized in the afternoon under the impact of rising gold prices. The brand "Bright 120" was offered at 3.22 million yuan in the morning and 3.4 million yuan in the afternoon, and the brand "High Mountain" was offered at 3.16 million yuan in the morning and 3.3 million yuan in the afternoon. This marks a large increase of 140,000-150,000 yuan from the previous day. However, there were very few transactions in the afternoon. As for other varieties such as "Semi-Dull 120", the asking price was slightly lower than the previous day due to the lack of interest. Factory yarns had a firm market sentiment yesterday, with rumors that the Chuanzhong company will purchase the Autumn yarn for 6 million yuan will become reality. And because of the rising gold prices in the afternoon, there were attempts to raise the asking prices, but transactions were still rare. Yesterday, only Chuanzhong company offered 15 packages of D-grade yarn, transacted at 3.95 million yuan. Silk fabrics are all sluggish, with little trading in mattress covers and brocade.</p>
