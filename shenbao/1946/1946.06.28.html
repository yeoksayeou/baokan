<p>〔本報南京廿七日電〕馬歇爾特使於獲悉中共所提整軍案之對案後，旋於今晨晋謁蔣主席，有所商談，談話時間長達三小時。下午周恩來兩訪馬歇爾，第一次爲一時半至四時第二次爲六時至九時，談話內容仍爲設法折衷政府與中共之意見、據有關人士稱：共方對案，政府不能接受，政府方案中共不能同意，雙方意見距離仍遠，故目前仍側重於會外之斡協商。現距體戰限期僅餘二日又半，設會外商談獲有成就，正式會議僅需數小時即可完成。京中人士對於軍事三人會一再休會，顯示焦灼，但有資格之觀察家僉信任在週末以前，能使雙方意見接近，大局仍有好轉之可能。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿七日電〕第三方面因感於停戰限期即屆，感奔於折衷工作。今日下午三時，曾在藍家莊舉行商談，除民盟代表外，有莫德惠曁陳啓二氏，談話至六時始畢。談話內容，對一般問題，均已涉及，唯主要在希望雙方對整軍意見，能多作讓步，俾使休戰期內所談之三問題，均獲得圓滿解決。又第三方面擬於明日再約定政府代表會談，以促進雙方意見之接近，且正攷　續與馬歇爾特使晤談，並瓷缸意見。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿七日電〕軍事三人會議明日仍繼續休會，此項消息於今晚十一時傅出。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿七日電〕據某權威人士談：政府最近所提之整軍新方案，其原則係基於一讓再讓三讓之結果修訂而成者，政府對於關內外共軍駐區之指定，已煞費苦心，外傅政府要求中共在東北放棄哈爾濱齊齊哈爾，安東等六個駐區，在關內放棄熱河，膠東，及蘇北三個戰略地帶一說，雖未證實，然在上述省區以內之人民，已表不滿，共黨應引以爲戒，勿再累人心而　土地，信強權而忘公理，臨國家於萬劫不復之境。又訊：軍事三人會之會外活動，將止於明日，上午屆時如有結果，下午有舉行會議之可能。</p>

<p>〔本報南京廿七日電〕據關係方面透露：中共對政府所提整軍方案之對案，其內容包括下述三原則：（一）以政治軍，保障人民自由，政府民主及改革農村；（二）　軍民公治，雙方軍隊之駐紮區域，應集中於點而不散佈於面，使軍隊集中於大城市，俾各鄉村戰後得加緊復員，軍隊不干涉民政，力避內戰危機；（三）軍令軍政軍訓在公管情形下，求　統一，部隊長只管訓練，補給，後勤方面專有組織機構，軍令由改組後之國民政府委員會統一指揮。上述中共所提之整軍對案發表後，據某中立人士談，中共整軍對案之內容，果如上說，則所言業去題甚遠，現距停戰最後限期不過三日，而中共對整軍問題中亟待解決之實際問題，如共軍駐區問題，迄未提出正確合理之意見，惟事搬弄美麗動聽之詞名，以迷惑世人耳目，其用意顯然在「拖」，試觀中共對策之第一點，所謂「保障人民自由」，第二點所謂「使軍隊集中於各大城市，俾各鄉村於戰後得加緊復員」，其言甚善，但中共如不洗心革面，痛改前非，則中共佔領區內之人民，將永生無自由可主，中共佔領區內之鄉村，亦不知何年何月方能復員也。至中共對案第三點所云軍令應留待將來政府故組時討論，在協商整編統編軍隊之今日，胡扯及此，謂非設詞施拖延，其誰信之。</p>
<p>〔聯合社南京廿七日電〕新民報今日載稱：中共方面昨日午後對中共之整軍補充提案已提出對案，其中並不包括擴大東北駐軍之新要求。</p>

<p>〔中央社南京廿七日電〕大赦案經立法院通過後，記者頃走訪司法院通過之大赦案內容以觀，對一般民事刑事罪犯，可謂相當寬大，而對戰犯及漢奸貪污烟毒等罪犯，則顯然毫無縱容，蓋大人赦乃國家隆典，法律雖不外乎人情，合理運用，固應如此也，依照該案乙項列舉之不赦或减刑之各款，則舉凡漢奸均在不赦减之列，僅藏匿不報或包庇縱容，及故意誤告者，得適用赦减辦法，食污者亦均在不赦减賂者，得適用赦减辦法烟毒犯僅吸食者可援用赦减辦法，但其犯第二次者，亦不適用。又據一般估計，目前全國緊獄之軍民犯罪約達七十萬，人，大赦令頒佈之後，此中約有五分之三，可望得到國家隆典之恩而重獲自由。</p>

<h3 id="c24">社論　由中美農業合作說起 <a href="#c24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>中美農業技術合作團美國代表，由加州大學農學院院長赫契生博士率領，已於昨日午後抵滬。他們即將深入全國各地農村，作半年的考察與調查，然後對症下藥，對於我國農業政策及技術的改進，以及外銷農產品之增加與推銷，均將提出具體改革方案，供我國政府的採擇。當此我國農村瀕於破產之際，吾人對於美國農業代表團的來華，確實抱着無限的期望，表示萬分的歡迎。</p>
<p>我國以農立國，全國人口百分之八十為農民，但以生產方式停留在中世紀的階段，數十年來迭受天災人禍的摧殘。乃瀕於破產的邊緣。「全國十九省報災荒，三千萬人民在饑餓」，這兩句話還不足以描畫今日中國農民的愁眉苦臉。唯有深入農村，親身目睹，始能洞悉中國農村經濟的趨於崩潰，確已到了嚴重關頭。單以糧食一項而論，素稱地大物博的中國，還不能自給自足，除向聯總要求食米四十萬噸及小麥七十萬噸以外，並曾設法向巴西阿根廷暹羅越南購運米麥，以期補充民食，其他更不說必了。至於戰前出口的大宗如茶絲桐汕猪鬃皮毛以及大豆等等，近來不僅生產銳减，而且又因交通阻塞，工資昂貴，以致成本過高，國內價格竟遠在國外之上，實感無法出口。這種情形如聽其自然，則農村破產，就將無法避免，而建國復興的偉業，亦何從談起？本報社論一再指出，工業建設應從建設農業和安定農村着手，而且以為中國的工業化，應先使農業工業化。美國農業代表團此次來華，都是經驗豐富的專家，負有協助中國建設農業的重大任務，此足以證明美國政府對於協助中國的建國復興，確具有充分的誠意。我們代表窮而無吿的中國農民，不但表示欣慰，並且深願盡我們的力量，來接受美國專家的指導。</p>
<p>中國農村破產的原因，誠不一而足，但其中最重要的，還在人禍的摧殘。例如在抗戰勝利之後，共產黨為了擴充地盤，即散播鄕村，封鎖城市，破壞交通，發動內戰，使全國農村，騷擾不安。在共軍佔領的所謂「解放區」內，不但被他們所目為地主的備受酷刑，即一般安分守己的善良佃農，亦多無法立足。今日大江以南，輾轉他鄕，流離失所，許多可憐無吿的蘇北難民，就是顯著的一例。所以挽救農村破產，除了技街上的改革而外，安定農村，更須努力。怎樣始能安定農村？政府停戰令中所指示的停止衝突，恢復交通，和整編統編軍隊，就須趕緊於本月底協議完成，澈底執行。換言之，必須切實做到和平統一，方有希望。據聯合社前天電訊，美國軍事援華法案，業經衆議院外交委員會以十五票對二票通過，此項法案將來必能成立施行，已是不成問題的了。馬歇爾特使曾致電國務院，力主美國繼續在軍事上協助中國，以保持中國之統一與安定，這是最有遠見的措施。我們更以為美國這一法案的通過，必將促成中國農村得以早日恢復安定，加速致力於生產。因為中國軍隊不整編，不减縮，是沒有方法恢復農村的生產力的。</p>
<p>由此可知，美國一方面在經濟上協助中國改良農業，以解除中國大多數人民的痛苦。另一方面又在軍事上協助中國縮編軍隊，以保持國內的統一與安定，雙管齊下，希望中國得在最短期間走上復興的大道。我國人民對於美國盟友這一番的努力與好意，除了感謝而外，祇有格外勞力建設，方無愧怍。但是毛澤東却在延安公開發表反美言論，要求美國立即停止對華援助，早日撤退在華美軍，甚至誣詆「美國援華為製造中國的內戰，陷中國於分裂混亂恐怖與貧困，」眞不知其何以大發夢囈至此。各地的共黨，在延安的發號施令之下，都在起勁張貼反美的標語，而上海並屢有毆辱美軍人員，陰謀造成類乎「義和團」的反美事件者。中共的這種作風，無非欲煽動無知愚民的反美情緒，間接使美國國內不明瞭中國政情的人們，起來要求政府不再聞問中國的事情。假使其詭計得售，不獨中國業其害，世界和平亦必受其影響。美國農業代表團來華聲中，對於中共的陰毒宣傳，應該有高度的警惕。</p>
<p>戰後中國人民日夜所蘄求的，是國家的和平統一。與繁榮。美國朝野所望於中國者，也是和平。統一·與繁榮。美國朝野之所以如此，不僅為中美兩國的共同利益，而且美國認為惟有一個强大·統一·民主的中國在遠東建立起來，始可希望中美英蘇在遠東眞能携手合作，奠定和平的基礎。中國如不能民主統一而强大，中國就有成為世界三次大戰戰場的可能。而這正是中國人和美國人所都不願見其發生的。所以美國的援華，以及中國之樂於接受美國的援助，都是為了整個世界和平着想的，在美國旣非侵略，在中國亦非依賴。中美間的任何往來，我們須像農業合作團一樣，始終不忘「合作」二字。惟平等才能合作，亦惟合作才見友誼。中美兩國的通力合作，純出於雙方眞誠的友誼，不僅農業技術合作一端而已。</p>

<p>供述乃父被刺經過</p>
<p>〔聯合社東京廿七日電〕國際法庭今日續響日本戰犯，由前某報社社長籐田出庭，證明第廿七名被吿橋本欣五郞曾主張在滿洲採取積極行動。籐田追述一九三一年八月橋本曾與參謀官重野會商滿洲情形，及其「危害日本權利與人民」。閱十日至十五日，重野携日金四萬元至其家中，請為保管，以備隨時需用，數日後即取去二萬元。九一八事變發生後，重野稱：關東軍將驅逐張學良出東三省，事若不成，則切腹自殺。籐田昨曾謂橋本在一九三一年三月政變中為一主謀人物。美艦潘南號及英艦瓢蟲號在南京被炮擊時，橋本係當地日軍指揮官。繼由犬養毅子犬養健證明其父反對日本侵略東三省，九一八事變發生後數月，曾晋謁日皇，請下詔撤　日軍，但未如願以償。當時其父任首相，彼為其父秘書，兼任國會議員。其父反對承認偽滿洲國，以為此舉侵犯中國主權。其父與中國國父孫中山為密友，在東京時相過從。為謀解決滿洲問題，曾密派代表至南京謁蔣委員長，無因反對侵略，削减軍事預算，致觸忤軍閥。當時陸軍大臣為荒木貞夫，現亦列入被吿。其父後在橫濱發表反軍閥演說，指斥法西斯主義，閱一星期，即在官邸被海軍軍官暗殺。惟被吿辯護律師於盤問證人時，並不提及犬養毅晋謁日　一事，頗可注意，足見被吿律師不欲令任何見證將日軍戰時行動歸日　負責。最近東條英機曾向聯合社記者聲明，對於首席檢察官季南表示日皇不應以戰爭犯起訴，殊為欣慰，此言係表示一般日人之希望，勿以軍閥時代之責任累及朝廷。</p>

<h3 id="c45">原子彈爆炸力量　可能引起地震　氣候恐亦將發生變化　地震學家史特羅夫之推測 <a href="#c45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>〔聯合社舊金山廿六日電〕參加七月一日比基尼珊瑚島原子彈試騐之最後一批艦船，已於上星期自此間駛出。地震學者史特羅夫今日發出警吿稱：予恐試騐時無一人可以生還報吿試騐情形，世界氣候恐亦將因此而起變化，數十年內難以復原。上週自此間啓碇艦船，計有「巴納敏」號上載美國國會，各聯合國家以及科學界代表；「藍嶺」號上載軍事觀察員；新聞船「阿派拉欽」號上載各報各電台及雜誌記者，彼等將於七月一日前一二日抵此基尼。第一顆原子彈即預定於七月一日投擲，第二顆原子彈則定於七月二十日在珊瑚島包國之湖水內爆裂。史氏所發出之警吿，即由此第二彈而起，曾在「科學界」發表一文，揣測試騐時可引起之極度危險。</p>
<p>地球外壳　可使分裂</p>
<p>據史氏計算，如將地球外壳分裂為深四十哩，闊三米之兩半，其所需之力，將大至不可想像，大約所需之歐格（功之絕對單位）將達二十九位數字。原子彈發生之力量，其驚人程度，與此殆相彷彿，蓋僅少兩位數字而已。史氏之佔計係以廣島所投之原子彈為根據，其力量僅及比基尼試騐時所用者之一半。據史氏稱，届時因核子分裂而發生之原子能，足將地球外壳分裂為二，以後騐試巨大原子彈時，必須極端小心·即如廣島所投之原子彈，如在洋面或洋內爆炸，或者比基尼珊瑚島在以前數月其抗震力在正常狀態以下，則均可引起危險，以致無人能獲生還，報吿此次試騐情形。如海洋之底，於試騐時為原子彈所震裂，而其裂縫又相當之深，其中熱度勢必極高，海水將流入裂縫之內，其所發蒸氣，將使裂縫愈益加深並擴大，蒸汽膨脹之結果，可能發生海嘯，將所有供作轟炸目標與不供作轟炸目標之艦船，悉數摧毀。</p>
<p>海底爆炸　招致危險</p>
<p>且試騐中所用之原子彈，如較在廣島所投者為大，則自海底湧出之蒸汽，與揚起之塵土等物，其範圍及高度恐將比一八八三年克拉托亞火山爆發時所引起者，尤大數倍以上。如塵土數量眞比克拉托亞火山爆發時噴出者多數倍，則世界氣候恐將受其影響，而發生不利變化，達數十年之久。克拉托亞火山爆發時，噴出碎石末計達十至二十立方哩之廣，日光因受石末影響而變凉，此種情形，繼續數年之久。參加比基尼試騐之技術科學指導邵易爾氏，對原子彈爆炸時所發生之能力，亦曾作一估計，但史氏於其論文中並未提及。邵氏及合作人員曾計算原子彈在水內爆裂時，其發出之能力，究有若干可以傳達水中，據其估計大約將為發出能量之百分之十至五十。原子彈在海洋內爆裂後，其所能引起海底地震，或如火山爆發之能量，卽僅至此數而已。依據邵氏數字，則史民所云試騐時地壳將裂開之說，其所需原子能將比其本人計算者多兩倍至十倍之數。據史氏所云數字，則廣島所投原子彈之力量，實際上較舊金山地震尤大。</p>
<p>撥動機鈕　造成地震</p>
<p>但據原子能科學家計算，原子彈之爆炸力，與舊金山地震時相比，僅為後者震動力之千分之一至萬分之一而已。但原子彈爆炸所能引起之眞正危險，已因此者可窺見一斑。即使原子彈之爆炸，本身不足以造成地震，但仍可因此而使可能發生地震之處為之爆發，一如撥動槍上機鈕。譬如原子彈落下之處，其下面之岩石本來已呈脫節之態，則經此一震，難免即吿分裂。此種分裂或可愛自然力之影響而擴大成為地震。史氏所以恐懼如比基尼珊瑚島在試驗前數月之抗震力低下，則此次原子彈爆裂，極有引起地震之可能，其原因即在於此，雖然，此種「地震機鈕」之說，亦係屬於理論，極可令人懷疑。颱風及海上巨風，有時可引起地震，則為事實。此項暴風能使海底發生强烈震動。聖路易之馬克倫神父曾於地震儀上記出　風所造成之震動力量。此種震動所發生之能量，或者尤多於原子炸彈，但似仍不足以使地震一觸即發。墨西哥第一次試騐原子彈時，曾將地殼炸陷六呎，直徑約半哩，事實上與發動地震無異，但當時震動尙輕，範圍亦不甚廣，並未成為「地震機鈕」而引起眞正之地震。</p>

<p>（一）中國政府建議有關農業計劃及執行此項計劃之組織，（二）就適合兩國政府合作之計劃部份，提出建議，並規定執行此項計劃所需之方針，人員，工具及組織。（三）就緊急問題，建議採取立即行動。次述工作進行之程序，赫氏稱：該團工作將由中美兩方代表團員合作計劃。故二國團員工作時，將取得密切聯繫，實地調查。最後共同硏究為達到該項計劃之目的計，應如何進行。渠稱中美兩團員多係學識經騐兩皆俱備之專家，深望各本所能以期有所貢獻。故所有該團之結論及計劃，均係根據兩國團負合作而得。據稱：美籍團員將在滬勾留十日然後晋京，在京滬兩地將與關係各方面，多多會談討論，俾使美籍團員，對我國情形，多多瞭解。經此項準備後，即將分小組出發各處實地調查，以明實情。預計調查時間，約需二個月。調查完畢後，即將　集所有數字及資料，擬具實用之改進計劃，並建議實施計劃之步驟，以貢獻政府採納。該團對我國出口貿易之四大農產品如桐油，茶，絲，羊毛等，將特別注意改進，務使增加生產，改良種質，以推廣中國之出口貿易，而充裕中國外滙資源。又該國除硏究處理緊急問題外，最主要之課題，將着眼於永久性之農業改良及合作計劃。赫氏旋列美國加州之柑橘，西部之桃種，依里諾州之大豆，其種均係來自我國，故認為我國農業對美頗有貢獻。聞該團調查範圍，西及甘肅靑海，南及海南島台灣，北將及東九省。美籍團員留華之期，約為四個半月云。</p>

<p>第一塲青　白克蘇聯</p>
<p>四時卅分，裁判蔣吟僧鳴笛開賽，靑白即取攻勢，蘇聯合力阻檔，仍難招架，二分鐘時，羅壽福得徐明德派司，近門掃射，即吿中的，一比〇青白首開紀錄。五分鐘後，格羅那司越過春華，即行叩關，竟吿得手，一比一扳成和局。未幾靑白顧以撤單騎深人，建功而返，二比一靑白又吿領前。蘇聯努力反攻，奈青白後防嚴密，不得逞，十七分鐘時，羅壽福左角派司，小顧偷襲進網，三比一靑白士氣大盛，距上牛時終了前三分鐘，羅壽福錦上添花，又下一城，四比一結束上半時。</p>
<p>休息再戰，兩軍陣容，均稍有變動，戰未多時，金福生陳倉暗渡，倫襲得中，五比一靑白已佔絕對優勢，十二分鐘時，蘇聯沙樂寗扳回一球，五比二蘇聯稍吐悶氣，奈青白攻勢益甚，羅壽福顧以撤相繼命中，迨鳴金收軍，七比二靑白輕取蘇聯。</p>

<p>壓軸戰奚玉　氏行開球禮，兩軍接觸，遠征軍不慣草地奔馳，時有跌撲，加以連日比賽不無乏力，演出遂格格不入，回顧西聯，猖　異常，三分鐘時，勞勃司托夫連越三關，打中紅心，一比〇，西聯先聲奪人。十分鐘時，碩友得坤勝派司，破關而入，一比一板成和局。未二分鐘，大蟲小黃毛雙騎並進，黃毛越位，未被發現，又　得一城，二比一西聯再度領前，上半時在混戰中結束。</p>

<p>貴報載棉花收穫量計算法一稿，施女士之申述。成本項下尙漏列肥料及捐稅支出二項，茲將蘇北南通東台一帶棉田收穫量及成本作一估計，以供參考。</p>
<p>一·收穫量：每畝豐年可收籽花市秤一百三四十斤，而歉年則僅穫五六十斤，設以每籽花三斤軋成花衣一斤計算，則每畝計收花衣二十斤至四十斤，滬上花價三餘鎭細絨每担九萬五千元（係司馬秤每斤合市秤一，二五斤强），實際上棉田　年每畝僅能收到一萬五千元，豐年始能收三萬元。</p>
<p>二·成本支出：棉籽每畝市秤三十斤約法幣二千元，工資一項，自耕麥田，下花種，施肥，削花草，掬花，以至拔花棋每畝至少須十五個人工，每工以五升米計（蘇北人工尙　，包括飯食烟酒在內每工不過五升米）需四萬五千元，肥料需價八千元至一萬二千元（如年年植棉，需肥較多，棉稻間種，需肥較少），田租每畝籽花二十斤至三十斤約價五千元至七千元，捐稅（蘇北共軍徵稅業佃各負一半）每畝約三千元。照上述估計，每畝收入僅一萬五千元至三萬元，成本須六萬五千元至七萬元，每熟須虧蝕三萬五千元至五萬五千元，故棉價太低，實為極不合理之現象。目前市價，金雙馬廿支紗每包一百四十三萬元，按每包紗凈重四百四十磅使須花衣司馬秤三百五十斤（淸花損耗計算在內）即可製成，加以工資及工廠利潤，日常開支每包紗估計最多需要五十萬元，故花衣合理的價格，每司馬担約法幣二十六萬元。按戰前每包紗（廿支雙馬）約價一百四十元，通州組絨每司馬担價二十二元，細絨每司馬祖二十九元，故紗價已漲起一萬倍，而棉價僅漲四千餘倍。紡紗廠之過份利得，實在太高，對棉花價格實應提價收買，查目前蘇北共區棉花通州組絨每市担已達十一萬元，實際上蘇北已無棉花運滬，此種物資流向共區之現象，予政府經濟上之打擊甚巨，幸我政府注意及此，又農民對植棉虧蝕之部分，大都以上熟之盈餘及副業收入彌補，工資方面，如自已家人足以應付，決不請短工，且以伴工方式交換耕作，且生活極苦，藉以渡過此種不合理的時期而已。于禾穎啓</p>

<p>— 本報記者徐守廉</p>
<p>上海記者團這次北行，主要的目的，是想看看蘇北豫魯一帶災情，交通現狀，和黃河泛濫區的種種情形。但是除此以外，沿途見聞，似乎也很有些頗富興趣之處，印象雖然瑣碎，也許可以使江南一帶的讀者，多少知道一點江南以外的風光罷。</p>
<h3 id="c126">鉛色天空　一片濃厚沙雲 <a href="#c126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>一個住似南方的人，忽然去到北方，生活上自然就覺得處處不同，何况所去的又是被戰爭摧毀了八年，元氣尙未恢復的徐州，開封，鄭州等隴海西段的幾個城市。首先使你感到異樣的，就是中原的風沙。記者在十一天行程之中，就曾領略過三次風沙况味。有一次是在鄭州，但見天空一片極濃厚的沙雲，一卷一卷駛過鉛色的天空—接着，突然之間，昏天黑地，什麼東西都看不見了。在屋子裏，就是在白天也得開燈。我在走路時用帽子把面部差不多完全遮起，不想回家一看，帽簷裏早已積成了小小沙邱了。</p>
<h3 id="c127">黃河鯉魚　別有一種風味 <a href="#c127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>當記者團過京時，本報駐京辦事處特在太平路梁園招待。梁　是有名的河南菜館，所以我們在京時，已先嘗到了河南口味了。然而自己走到河南一看，才曉得目下河南只有極少數的人才能吃到這種口味！</p>
<p>河南從抗戰開始到現在，遭遇的是年年災荒，歲歲兵燹。能有窩窩頭度日者已不多見。終年吃不到鹽和糖的，更是不知多少。幾百萬人急待賑濟，災况之嚴重，正不在湘桂諸省之下！</p>
<p>在一般人的想像中，黃河鯉該是河南最大衆的食品了，但事實上不然，在開封，在鄭州，黃河鯉是款待上賓的無上珍品，可是一尾二斤多重的代價就需萬元以上。黃河鯉煮法頗多：有糖醋，酸辣，甚至也有「一魚三吃。」最可口的燒法叫「太太魚，」據說是現任鄭州綏靖公署主任劉經扶將軍（峙）夫人所發明，是把黃河鯉佐以粉皮，及少許辣椒合煮，有湯，有些像上海的辣魚頭。</p>
<h3 id="c128">金條儘多　也救不了屋荒 <a href="#c128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>八年戰爭的批毀是可怕的，不然，怎麽會到處都鬧着屋荒呢！記者團沿途所歷，無一處不以屋荒為最嚴重的問題。但是據目睹的結果，證明了汴，鄭的屋荒，才是眞正的屋荒，因為在這裏，有了金條也還是沒有辦法，若干機關尙在瓦礫中辦公，比上海那種人為的屋荒，不知要嚴重多少倍！</p>
<h3 id="c129">彭城勝蹟　憧憬古代英雄 <a href="#c129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>訪問隴海西段時，我們也曾抽出極短的時間，遊　了不少名勝古蹟。在徐州這個古彭城，就有項羽遺留下的覇王樓，覇王宮，一直到九里山。在開封，有禹王台，相國寺，鐵塔，和龍亭，都足惹人留戀。龍亭裏，現在已找不出趙匡胤的潰像，居民們把他換上了「玉皇大帝」。但是龍亭的雄偉却令人憧憬着一代英雄奮鬥的事蹟。鄕人們指辨出遼遠的宋代楊家和潘家的故湖，以及包龍圖腰　陳世美的所在。名勝之一的相國寺，和上海的城隍廟一樣擠滿着人羣，攤販，小吃，賣藝……和上海都差不多。但是建築却實在偉大，從頭門到藏經樓，約有二里路之多。禹王台是開封唯一的風景區，可說是隴海綫上一個最幽美的勝地。現在由農會在那裏舉辦着許多果園。鄭州碧沙崗的建築也很雄偉。這是一座民族英雄的紀念塔，趙忠禹·佟麟閣·諸英雄的紀念塔，現正在建造中。它以「碧血黃沙」四字來紀念北國的民族烈士，的確是異常恰當的。</p>
<h3 id="c130">少年中國　寄以無窮希望 <a href="#c130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>在開封，我們曾到九十里外的黃泛區尉氏縣樊家寺參觀「行總」河南分署在那裏辦的實騐農塲。中送更憑弔了南宋岳武穆挫敵名地朱仙　。但現在的朱仙　，能够給人看到的，也僅是土樓高聳，給後人憑弔罷了。關岳廟裏，現在沒有河南省立第一育幼院。這是一個專事收容難童的機搆，現有男女難童四六七名，「行總」河南分署接濟了不少物資，所以每個兒童的營養和衣着，還能勉强過去。這育幼院辦得非常成功，管敎嚴格，特別注重體格的鍛鍊。在朱仙鎭關岳廟裏看見這些英氣勃勃的孩子，眞使人感到少年中國希望無窮。</p>
<p>徐·汴·鄭·三地的新聞事業相當發達，但因限於經費，還不能充份發展。徐州有報紙五種，「中報」規模較大。開封有九家，內有晚報二種，「民權新聞」銷路最廣，日出一大張。鄭州有報紙五種，最大的一家是「羣力報」。</p>
<h3 id="c131">一幕悲劇　妓女投井自殺 <a href="#c131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>自從南京禁舞之後，舞女都集中在　淮河伴客游湖，無數的　女子在秘密的操着皮肉生涯，在生活綫上掙扎。徐州自從綏署主任薛岳將軍蒞任之後，國際聯誼社每逢星期三六舉行的茶舞，也同時禁絕了。不過，在徐·汴·鄭三地的「特區」都是公開存在的，三地的娼妓人數差不多各有三百多人。徐州多揚帮，汴·鄭則以木地　佔多，　們大部份都是從「解放區」逃出來的難民。常記者團返滬時，徐州的當局亦已於六月二十日對這輩可憐蟲下了限五天內全部停業的命令。在下令後的第二天，一個無法生活的妓女發生了悄然投井自殺的一幕悲劇！（廿六日）</p>
<h3 id="c132">黃汎區踏勘 <a href="#c132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>— 本報記者　徐守廉</p>
<p>民國二十七年，國府內遷，武漢成為全中國全世界最注目的地方。前後方軍民一體，抱着一個最大的決心——保衛武漢！</p>
<p>敵人早就準備從華北沿平漢綫直衝武漢了，那時，敵華北派遺軍的司令是西尾，而負責搶平漢綫的，正是我們四萬萬同胞人人切齒痛心的土肥原的部隊。這位狡黠毒辣的間諜造成了九一八，造成了股汝耕組織，在這時候，正式擔任了侵略我國的前鋒！</p>
<p>我軍早就有了準備。在河南一帶集結着那時最精銳的二十軍團，總司令是萬福麟將軍，而這軍團裏却還有關麟　和胡宗南的部隊，此外還有從貴州等處調來的健兒。士氣激昻，軍容整肅，專等土肥原進犯。</p>
<p>然而土肥原沒有來成。</p>
<p>因為，在端陽的那一天，二十軍團奉到了命令，在鄭州花園口，決了黃河堤防！</p>
<p>執行命令的，是五十三軍的新編第四師。從那天起，黃河改了道。河南老百姓的犧牲是慘重的，但是勝利需要代價。這次決堤使敵人的戰略全部變更，因而武漢的淪陷延遲了十四個月。</p>
<p>這十四個月是我國乃至全世界歷史的轉捩點，沒有這十四個月，也許聯合國的勝利就沒有這樣快，這樣澈底。河南同胞的犧牲，不是沒有報酬的。</p>
<p>然而，這是何等偉大的犧牲啊！</p>
<h3 id="c133">偉大的犧牲 <a href="#c133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>八年前，以至八年中的損失，我們不必談了。下面，是從本年元旦到六月十日止，河南省政府對黃河災情的一部份報吿：</p>
<p>鹿邑縣參議會：「黃河故道，發生桃汛，自縣境西北，淘漫而來……長約四十里，泛濫面積，長寬處約四十里……麥旣流沒，秋難播種，今年災象已成……」</p>
<p>臨頴縣政府：「……河水暴漲，堵口洩水，聚集斯　，淹沒田苗一千七百餘畝，未淹者亦被水浸死，毫無收成之望……」</p>
<p>淮陽縣參會：「黃汜暴漲，泛濫成災，鄉鎭淹沒，一片汪洋，人民刦後餘生，復遭水災，呼天叫地，活命乏術……」</p>
<p>西華七區專署：「……連日黃水暴漲，汜區闊三十餘里，田禾盡毀，哀鴻遍野，十萬災民，急待救濟……」</p>
<p>沈邱縣政府：「本縣慘遭黃氾，巳歷九載……本月七日，黃水暴漲，其勢洶湧，較往年秋水為甚，以致所種麥苗，盡被淹沒，並將過去房舍，亦皆漂流……」</p>
<p>扶溝縣參會：「……花園决口未堵，氾區日益擴大，災情較前有增無减……本年伏汎，將有漫溢之虞，河東孫岳兩鄉，被災尤慘，一片蕪凉，不堪入目，政令因之無法推行……花園口决口不早堵合，則大汎勢必又來……」</p>
<p>詳細的捐失不必多說，讓我引幾句河南省政府印發的「災情實錄」，作　發的叙述罷：</p>
<p>「……豫東平原，本稱富庶之區，但因黃河改道，泛濫成災·中牟，尉氏·扶溝，西華二十餘縣，八年來深陷于黃水冲涮之中，村鎭房屋，均被淹沒，先後死傷人民達一百七十餘萬人！所餘突出水而之少數高地，災民則堆積蘆草，以蔽風雨，而多數人民，無家可歸，日常均以草根樹皮果腹，現仍繼續其顚沛流離之生活……」</p>
<p>又說：「八年來官堤民埝，大小决口。共三十二次，凡九十一處。受災縣份，計有西華，鄢陵，扶溝，淮陽，太康，睢縣，杞縣，尉氏，廣武，鄭縣，柘城，項城，商水，開封，鹿邑，通許，中牟，洧川，沈邱，陳留，凡二十縣，死亡人口達三十二萬餘人（按：實數為三十二萬一千九百八十九人）……房屋損失約一百八十六萬餘間，被淹田地達六百五十萬畝有奇！……」</p>
<p>這是一個偉大的戰爭，一個偉大的勝利。這勝利並不來得偶然，我們的確是付過了一筆很重的代價的。</p>

<p>記者先生：台灣接收已經八個月了，長官公署的一切措施是否合理，我們且不談，因為這是「大政方針」，關連繁雜。現在有一件極簡單的事，台灣當局完全忽視了，那就是台灣的郵票，到今天仍然通用「大日本帝國郵便」的舊票，上面也不過加蓋「中華民國台灣省」七個字。（附樣子）不知台灣省當局是何用意？利用廢物嗎？難道這點小紙亦看到眼中？最初數月或可利用，為什麼直到今天還在利用？臺灣沒有印刷廠嗎？為何不在上海印？為何不仿東北先例，將國內郵票運往，加蓋「限臺灣省貼用」字樣？這樣辦又省事又可顧到臺灣的幣制。這不是一件小事啊！這軍關係整個國體，且可象徵國家是否統一。中共為了割據，所以另印什麼「邊區」郵票，台灣當局又是什麽意思？高純齋上。</p>

<p>勝利終于來臨。聯合國沒有忘記中國千千萬萬同胞英勇的犧牲。美國的黃河專家杜德（OliverJ．Todd）負起了搶堵花園口的使命，他說，「無論這「中國的災難』是多麽嚴重，我要在七月一日之前完成堵口工作！」</p>
<p>美國的工程師都對這豪語覺得懷疑，可是杜德總於毅然到了中國。三月一日起，開始了黃河堵口復堤的工程。</p>
<p>花園口的「口門」，在開工時巳經寬達一四六〇公尺了，這幾月來，先完成了西段的土堤八百公尺。在記者寫這篇文稿時，聽說餘下的六百六十公尺也已經完成，是「合龍」的時候了。</p>
<p>「聯總」的確帮了我們不少忙。先後送到工程區的，有吉普車，水陸兩用汽軍，開山機，起重機，和各式土工和打樁的機器。此外，還有許多木料，木樁，洋灰，但最實惠的還是工賑辦法。在花園口一帶，現在有一萬多難胞在緊張地工作着，工餘之暇，居然也還有一些餘興，有人唱大鼓或者說相聲，讓這些疲乏了的鬥士們得到一些輕鬆感。</p>
<p>最近「聯總」運華的曳引機，有十九具已在河南省黃汜區內—尉氏縣樊家村，開始代替人工，復興我們戰後的農村。這種曳引機在中國落後的農村，還是創舉，所以我們先得訓練駕駛，硏究他的機械構造和管理，保養等等。第一期受訓的學員二十八人，都是農業大學畢業生，從五月初以來，在這一望無邊的原野上已有二千五百畝土地被他們開墾了</p>
<p>這種曳引機每具有十二匹馬力，但對較大的草根和柳樹根以及被埋沒在沙地下的斷牆殘垣等等是無法發揮它的力量，所以不得不借用人力，因此，「行總」河南分署在這裏利用了一千多名難胞，每日從事剷草拔根等淸理工作，每天八小時勞工的代價是麵粉二斤半法幣一百五十元，中午還有一餐在災區認為最豐富的用豆，小米，靑菜加鹽煮成一大碗稀飯，此外還有七十八個蓬帳供他們寄宿，每一蓬帳內可容納十八人最近分署還在計劃舉辦一個合作社。</p>
<p>然而像這樣的工作，在今日廣大的黃汜區內僅及四百分之一，最重要的一部份堤工是在共軍防地，他們什麽人都不信任，就是築堤也認為別具用心，因而最初是拚命反對，後來是炸毀機器，現在，杜德又趕到共軍區去和他們商量進行工作了。</p>
<p>秋汎來得很快，這是禁不起共產黨的「一拖再拖」的！</p>
<p>社德說：如果一切順利，那麼黃河水量全部之三分之二至四分之三，可以流入故道，到秋後下游堤防全部修復加强之後，全部水流就可以歸入故道，然後，就可以談到灌溉和排水了。</p>
<p>但願中共記得馬歇爾將軍的一句話：「勝利得來不易，我們不要浪費了這次勝利！（六，廿六，上海。）</p>

<p>— 開封廿一日通訊　范鴻</p>
<p>農田上使用曳引機來梨耙，不但在河南，就是在中國，也算是驚人的創舉，是農業上的重要改革。</p>
<p>我們早上搭救濟分署的汽車，出了南門，一直向南方走去，完全是在沙土道上馳騁着。看不到村莊，見不到樹木，只有殘存的半截破垣，是舊時村莊的遺跡，朱仙鎭，也變成一個半截寨門沒有人烟荒草蕪蔓的地方了。再向前走到孟莊，同樣荒草佔據了一切，看不出什麽遺跡的眉目來，居民早已不知死亡到什麼地方去了。</p>
<p>犂一次耙一次</p>
<p>那裏一片是比人還深的草原，車子行走在草叢中，人們逗着野草玩，遠望着平野無際的原野，是荒了七八年的中原人民的故鄉，不禁為那些已逃走已死亡的人們掉幾眼同情的眼淚！</p>
<p>再向前面到了樊莊，是曳引機使用的地點，那裏有二十多個人在受着美國技師的訓練，都穿着鄕間農夫的衣服，在那裏吃苦的敎練着學習着，有一大排帳棚就是他們休憇之所，另外有很多歸家的汎區人民，在作着挖樹根割草的工作，每天除伙食外？還有百多元的零用，是救濟分署以工代賑僱來的工人。在一個區域內除凈野草樹根之後，曳引機就開始在那塊平地上爬了起來，第一次是犁，第二次是耙。大概每日每機可犁地六十畝，每分鐘可犁四十平方尺，每日用汽油十五加侖，犁的深一英尺，寬二英尺，每個曳引機帶犁面二把，所以梨的面積較小，此項曳引機武功西北農林專科學校曾有一部，不過使用不多，沒有被人們多加注意。</p>
<p>曳引機犁過後，地下的新土都翻了上來，地上的雜草全翻了下去，這是一塊極肥沃的沙質埌土。如果秋後種下麥子，明年一定會有很滿人意的收穫，這已經荒蕪了七八年了。七八年的土地休息，加上黃河携帶下來的肥沃泥沙，已造成未來大量生產的重要因子，我們預祝着這一塊蒙受最大患害的土地，能成為最肥沃的土埌，每年給人們帶來最豐富的農產。</p>
<p>多分配一點能</p>
<p>現在這裏是黃汎區復興建設指導委員會及救濟分署辦的農塲，工作人員也很多，曳引機已有十九部，全數分配為五十部，已耕的土地有五百多畝，與二百多萬畝荒地相比，距離還有多遠！記得記者在重慶時，聽說美國給我們的曳引機是為解決河南耕牛損失的困難（損失四分之三達四百多萬隻），全部供給河南的，當時聽說中國人不會用，很多人都在作難，現在分配的數量未免與總數相差縣殊，而且只注意到黃汎區，還嫌不够，按曳引機的工作範圍和地區，豫東豫南的大平原，是很理想的工作地區，豫西的山中盆地，亦有很大的用處，站在河南省講話，希望多給該省分配一點，以救濟復興久經荒早兵蝗災害的農村。</p>
<p>恢復農村生產</p>
<p>我們見到曳引機的使用，知道中國農業科學化機器化，並不是一件什麼太難的事情，利用這些小型農具，並不一定要重劃國內耕地面積，把耕地面積擴大，但我們應該注意的是自己怎樣仿造和怎樣修理，這些問題解決，中國農業是非有一次大革命不可</p>
<p>黃河冲毀了汎區人民的田產家園，冲走了妻子母女的生命，冲毀了他們一切的希望……現在又被新式曳引機曳回了他們的命運，曳回了他們的希望，也曳回了我們農村的繁榮！</p>
<p>暮色蒼茫中，我們很興奮的坐着吉普車回來。</p>

<p>— 少夫</p>
<p>前兩天，有一個訪問大塲空軍第八大隊的機會，起了個早，在大隊部和飛機塲盤桓了一天，人雖然疲倦，所獲確乎不少，尤其楚八大隊幾位空軍朋友的熱誠。</p>
<p>八年來，我特別對於空軍朋友有一種高度的感情，並不完全是為了他們的工作危險，作戰英勇，担負了空中劣勢下的艱難任務，也是為了他們每個人樸棄的心，火辣辣的熱情，和坦白眞摯的態度。他們彼此之間如弟兄，他們對其他人也那麼親切和直率。他們如兒童，純潔，他們似乎是仙子，人間的醜惡等等，絕不相關。</p>
<p>這種生活情狀，不由我不對他們不發生高度的感情。</p>
<p>這一次訪問，喫了一頓他們的「空軍給養」午餐，參觀了他們的宿舍，管理室，跑道，和B24飛機。歸來我有很多感想，道裏我衹提出兩點來：</p>
<p>第一點，他們的生活並不如我們想像中的那麼享受，舒服，一千多人擠在那幾座狹小的平房裏，八個人十個人一個房間，甚至還有雙層舖。所以勤務們祗好住在臨時搭蓋帳棚裏了。</p>
<p>第二點，他們除了工作外，在那荒凉的鄉間，精神上缺少調劑，往往感到十分苦悶，而進城則路途寫遠，往返需時，需錢，因此他們極歡迎有朋友去和他們談談。</p>
<p>空軍第八大隊是從甄拔而來的最優秀份子，他們正在為開闢中國的海洋航線而努力，希望大家能對他們有以慰藉。</p>
<h3 id="c145">戰車開入滬江 <a href="#c145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>— 鮑鍾祺</p>
<p>一幕驚心動魄的野戰</p>
<p>蔣緯國少校自從在六月三日參加滬江大學的早會以後，滬大的同學已完全與他的部下打成了一片，感情非常融洽，滬大的各學生團契常常請他們的長官來講演關於印緬戰塲的情形，或邀他們來參加球類比賽。六月廿一日，蔣少校更親自率領了中國裝甲兵戰車第一營的健兒們到滬江大學來表演坦克野戰。</p>
<p>同學們聞訊以後，都雀躍三百，高興非凡。有照相機的同學也都把軟片預備起來，以免失去這一個千載難逢的良機，學校中頓時顯出了紊亂，如臨大敵一樣</p>
<p>很多的同學在午膳以後就已立在門目等着。終於在近千的同學熱烈的期望中，六輛M3A3式的大型坦克駛進了滬江大學的正門。隨後蔣緯國少校偕同夫人也乘汽車到塲，坦克野戰表演就在瘋狂的鼓掌聲中開始。</p>
<p>蔣少校跳上了臨時的司令台，在麥格風前演說了幾句，接着就介紹了此次表演擔任指揮的蔡連長，周連附和唐排長，他們都是在印緬作戰時極負盛譽的幾位長官，今天都很高興的來參加表演。</p>
<p>在蔡連長的發令下，唐排長指揮了四輛戰車開始前進，他坐在有綠色旗幟的指揮坦克上，用無綫電來轉佈命令，每輛戰車上有四位勇士，即無綫電員，駕駛手機關，砲手和槍手，這時，帶着攝影機的同學開始了他們的活躍，高低左右，各種角度都被攝入了鏡頭，替滬江歷史上，留下珍貴的一頁。</p>
<p>這時五輛戰車已在作「性能表演」了。唐排長的坐車率先前進，爬上了很高的泥堆，其傾斜度幾達四十多度，好像就要傾覆的樣子。沒有戰事經騐的我們全都被危險的處境嚇得大叫起來，尤其是　在女生宿舍窗口的女同學們，居高臨下的看來，更覺心驚膽寒。可是駕駛員巧妙的把握着操縱棍（相當於汽車上的凡而盤），安穩的超過了泥堆。據將少校說，道裏因為塲地的限制，所以表演還不够充分。在印緬戰塲時，用一邊的輪鏈駛過小木橋，那才眞的危險呢！可是每個同學對於今天戰車的性能表演已感非常的滿意了。</p>
<p>接着，就是「隊形演習」。以三輛或四輛戰車編成一隊，或排成橫隊，這是適用於攻擊及掩護大部隊戰鬥前進的方式；或排成縱隊，用於行軍及正面突破敵陣的時候；或排成梯形，是掩護自已之側方，包圍敵人之側　的一種；以後，再表演用於搜索前進的楔隊式；最後就是利於猛攻敵陣的反楔隊，排列緊密而有連　，非常壯觀，表演已竭盡千變萬化的能事，使人如墮五里霧中</p>
<p>「隊形演習」完畢後，再表演「戰塲救護」。假設一輛戰車陷於困境，不能自拔，失去戰鬥力時，於是，這輛戰車就發出求救汽笛信號。同時，車內的人員也携出機關槍，衝鋒槍等武器下車俯伏掩護，免遭敵人破壞。直到其他救護戰車駛到，用畏鏈將它拖至安全的地點，再行檢查修理，恢復共戰鬥力。</p>
<p>最後，再表演一些其他戰車集合的使用，潛望鏡的應用，和瞄準敵人射擊的技術後，這一幕偉大的表演遂吿完畢。</p>
<p>這時蔣緯國少校又上台發言了：「諸位同學，今天的表演已經完畢，可惜因為塲地的限制，時間的關係，所以我們不能使用更多的戰車來表演更偉大的節目，如果我們儘量表演的話，那未，貴校復校來修好未久的校園，將受更大的損失了。」的確，戰車的威力太驚人了，二棵很粗的樹，已被它壓得粉碎。草地上也刻劃着深深的車痕，構成了一個縱橫交錯的圖案。還有在戰爭期內，被敵寇破壞後的頽牆殘壁，今天也被戰車一掃而光。</p>
<p>演習完畢後，蔣少校向參加表演的二十餘位官兵訓話，勉勵有加，並與各指揮官一一　手，官兵們立正敬禮後，就跨上道馳騁印緬戰塲的俎克歸營，蔣少校也在十幾個照相機的集中攝影下，與夫人步入了汽車。</p>

<p>— 方君</p>
<p>為了愛讀書的原故，二十多年來聚積下了不少綫裝書，其中固然有費了好些錢才得購來，其中也有好些是不常見的本板本。我一向在興致來了的時候儘自去撫　着它們，翻閱它們，往往是自晝至夜。二十多年來的輾轉流徙，自然喪失了許多，但為了是心愛之物，每一次逃難，都於事前有了準備，所好的還損失無幾，而這損失無幾的六百多本裏面，着着實實跟我結了二十多年的緣，我也很感激它們頻年給我不少的智識。</p>
<p>我這許多年來對它們的保存實在費了不少的心力的，怕霉了，便小心地去曝太陽；怕蛀了，便洒臭粉，藏胡椒粒，無論至貧極病的時候，日日都得去整理它們，拭塵埃，理殘頁，不忙上幾個時辰，總不　罷手。然而，到如今，再也無法將它們保存了，為了貧，也為了病。病已是不能再事遷延不治的了，同時食齒又繁，家裏消費的人實已不少。於是，在典質供盡的情况之下，祇好並此而去之而已。</p>
<p>在初，我的念頭還只轉到英文書籍上去，以為勝利了，以後交通無阻，文化要恢復以前的構通，只要有錢，英文書籍不愁沒買處，便整數的售給舊書攤，要回來一個看得見的代價，但也剩着一本，那是＂The　OpiumClippers”那書是一位美國朋友送給我的，市上沒有售處，據說香港找不出第三本來。我可不是為了這些，而實在是為紀念一個友人的贈與，才要把它保存，永資紀念。</p>
<p>而現在，運那本版書籍也難以與我一再結綠了，迫而又去放棄了它們，放棄了它們，可以使我換回不少治病的藥物和養活一班寄生虫的物質。人總是在這方面打算吧！我已給負累得麻本起來，連人也不想繼續去做了。</p>
<p>這批書籍從明版的一批中檢回了較爲完好的兩部，一是「春秋繁露評」，另一是「謝宣城集」「謝宣城集」只有一本，經過藏書人的重裝，書面上寫着「高齋讀本」四個朱字，又用墨筆寫着「謝宣城集明張　百三家原刻本丙子十月十九日重裝」兩行小字。「春秋繁　評」是兩本成為一帙的，序後有名平遠的識「明刊本董子，陳孝廉廷瑛所藏；孝廉卒後，書散假，而此本平遠購之。葉楚白先生，與遠在敎忠學堂同事五年，勞而不伐，簡而靜，數年如一日。其董子所謂正其誼不謀其利，明其道，不計其功者耶？今將北行留贈此帙，且識景仰」下書「宣統三年正月平遠謹呈並記」等字。</p>
<p>這兩部書我要留下尙還有一段因緣，並不祗是較為完好而已，而是，書籍現在已不値錢，就算併此而賣了，也增加不了多少的代價，倒不如留　些好罷。</p>
<p>有人說？兒子出賣其先人的藏書是　虫，那末，我出賣自己的藏書可算是自己的　虫了！</p>

<p>國有國格，人有人格。夫印，亦有印格，宋代趙孟類，書法極佳，因仕元朝，乃書法之品格降低。愛國志士，葉而不肯懸諸堂前，甚而焚毀之。別有某先生（忘其姓氏）擅書枯籐字，則有國家觀念之有骨氣人也，寇至求警，知不可拒，乃舉菜刀自斷手臂却之。良以兩國相爭應無條件各為其國，吾之所謂印格即在此。况藝術為國家文化之代表，我輩藝人身份，可想而知。亟宜自尊自重。政府對藝術一項非不注意，正想迎頭趕上別國。戰前在京見政府撥巨款建國立美術陳列館，至今尙巍立南京國府路，可為明證，其或不能作直接物質之獎掖，亦實有苦衷，藝人應原諒之。抗戰九年，上海為我國第一大都市，我上海市印人中曾無有為敵偽張目者乎？亦可愧也已。</p>

<p>「父親，你應該讓母親去賣這些鷄蛋。」</p>
<p>「為什麼？」他父親很驚奇的說。</p>

<p>— 鄧蹊</p>
<p>在重慶的四周，有東·南·西·北·四個溫泉。其中東·西兩溫泉，離開重慶頗遠，且不在重慶市區管轄的範圍內，所以也不甚著名。而南·北兩泉，則屬重慶的範圍，對峙相望，風景幽美，到重慶的人，很少不到這些地方去玩一次的。</p>
<p>北溫泉是在離重慶市區七十餘公里的北殕，從重慶到北碚，可以乘公共汽車，或於溯嘉陵江乘輪而上。</p>
<p>北培是一個新型的小都會，有人也稱她為「小重慶」。她有着重慶的所有的精華，以及極完備的遊戲塲所。但她並沒有重慶那樣的滿天飛塵，以及熙熙攘攘的喧閙市聲。</p>
<p>從嘉陵江乘輪而上，到了北碚，而從北　沿着嘉陵江慢慢地走四五公里，便到北溫泉了。北溫泉地踞着溫塘峽的山腰，兩岸高峽對峙。登高十級，便可眺望北殕，夏壩，以及依稀中的重慶。俯視脚下，則是盪漾在嘉陵江上悠悠的帆影。而北泉的背後，是靠着聳高的縉雲山，古樹掩秀峯，的確另有一種軒昂的氣概。</p>
<p>北泉有公園，有浴室，有游泳池，有蓮花池，有乳山洞，有羊山亭，竹林花草，泉水迴旋傍石通流各處。據說因為北地溫泉，所以花樹是得天獨厚，早開遲謝，而建築在溫塘峽山腰的左側的溫泉浴室「澣塵」，設備完全，而且在十幾個浴室外，又有室內游泳池，露天游泳池。出浴之後，又可以在靠江的茶店稍息，然後再沿着彎斜的石徑，到縉雲山，農莊，和玻璃殿中的岡書館去玩玩，館內藏書及古物頗多，其中尤以「漢洗」為最珍貴（註）眞可說是罕世奇寳了，不過現在每逢例假方才開放展覽。</p>
<p>從重慶市區過揚子江，到海棠溪車站，乘公共汽車約廿五公里，過小溫泉，中央政治學校，便可到這南溫泉。桃柳夾岸，繞環山麓，每年四季，遊人不絕。而暑大中，於此避暑，徐風過處，花香烏語，何復再有炎威之苦呢？</p>
<p>南溫泉的附近是一個鄕村中的村市。一條整潔的馬路，兩傍的白楊，茂密枝葉，掩影樓台，巧似進了恬靜怡情的大院落。</p>
<p>南溫泉裏面有小溫泉，（在政校內），設備完美的旅社，與食店，圖書館，花園，沐浴的地方有浴室，游泳池，泉水溫熱而潔凈，擁彼入水，或坐在溫泉噴口處，如意的泉水冲流，心懷溫適，所有身心的積累，都一滌而盡了。</p>
<p>「南泉賢北泉聖」。我愛重慶的南北溫泉，我愛北泉的美，但我也喜歡南泉的嫵媚……</p>
<p>註：漢洗是唐代的遺物，狀如合金的水盤。盤底刻有四條浮雕鯉魚，盤緣兩邊各執一耳。放水入盤後，用手按耳摩擦，輕摩則發出瑩瑩之音，漸漸加水，則嗚聲嚮如汽笛，具有柔揚莊重的聲調。在這時候便見盤內的水由盤底四條鯉魚噴出，源源不歇，水花跳躍，有如泉水，花有達尺餘高者，在對光映照時水分呈霓紅色，堪稱奇觀。</p>

<p>各式各樣的錢幣支票</p>
<p>紐約花旗銀行的收藏部，所收藏的各種貨幣，眞是蔚為奇觀，同時也可以從這裏看出通貨膨脹的恐怖。</p>
<p>那裏，有一枚第一次大戰後的德國錢幣，値一，〇〇〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇馬克，在一九二三年的德國，這樣一個天文學數字的錢幣，僅供找零頭之用罷了。但是，倘以一九一四年的馬克價値來計算，恐怕全世界的金子也不够鑄這樣一枚錢幣。</p>
<p>二次大戰中，德義佔領下的希臘，又是一個可怕的通貨膨脹的例子。一九四一年，最高額的鈔票是一千希幣，到了一九四四年，最高票面竟達五百萬希幣。</p>
<p>該銀行中所收集的有六萬種的貨幣，足以代表歷史上各期的貨幣。那裏面有五千年前的埃及圓幣，以至今年一月發行的羅斯福角子，有最早的中國明代的鈔票，也有中儲的偽幣</p>
<p>此外，還有許多別種的通貨：啄木鳥頭壳，象尾巴，毛瑟槍彈，茶磚，魚鈎，鯨魚牙，樹膠丸等。</p>

<h3 id="c154">傷寒病菌的來蹤去跡 <a href="#c154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>— 郭可大陳文龍</p>
<p>在談判到傷寒症的病原問題之前，我們首先得正名，在我國古醫裏有一名著呌傷寒論，裏面所論到的症候，固然有一部分是屬於真性傷寒症的，可是很多部分却是敘述其他的急性傳染的，就是在西洋當科學醫學發達的初期，在臨床上，傷寒症和其他類似的疾病也不容易區別，所以古時的記載都是混亂不清。自從近代細菌學和血清發達以後，　把這個相當複雜的問題弄清楚。現在我們知道所謂傷寒症，是指由於正型傷寒　菌所引起的急性傳染病而言。有一類比較症候累些的傷寒症，是由於副傷寒桿菌引起的。稱爲「副傷寒症」。副傷寒桿菌在形態上不能和傷寒桿菌分別，但在生物化學和血清反應上有顯明的區別存在。至於斑疹傷寒症，那完全是另外的一種病，症候上有些地方雖然相似，異別這處仍然很多，而病原體本身和傷寒桿菌就完全不同。斑疹傷寒症的病原體「立克次氏小體」，爲立克次氏所發現。這種小體不能夠用普通的細菌染色法來染色，也不能用普通的細節培養基來培養，只能在生活的細胞裏繁殖，所以它的培養，非用活的動物或組織培養法或雞胎法不克。而且傷寒症的傳染是直接地由口腔侵入胃腸系統，而斑疹傷寒症却是由於蟲子或跳蚤的傳染而來的。</p>
<p>傷寒桿菌很小，不能夠用肉眼看到，祇是在顯微鏡底下才能觀察到軸的形態，短短的棒形，菌的兩端略呈鈍圓，周圍生有十多根　毛，所以能夠活潑地運動</p>
<p>傷寒桿菌的培養很容易，在微呈　性或是西馬生的培養基裏，都能夠順利繁殖。最適宜的繁殖溫度是和正常的人們的體溫差不多。可是在天然界中，也可能找到他的生存機會。在冰裏面傷寒菌可以有幾個禮拜的壽命，因此沒有殺菌過的冰塊，或是不潔的冰淇淋是有傳染的危險的，牠對於熱的抵抗力却相當弱，攝氏五十六度的溫度維持雨具發鎮就被殺滅，在百度的沸水裏傾刻間就死亡，所以在開水裏不會有傷寒菌。</p>
<p>傷寒桿菌的主要傳染來源是病人的大便和小便，因爲病人的大便裏和小便裏可以含有很多的傷寒桿菌，有時候病雖痊癒，可是在大便和小便仍然可以帶有病菌。還有一些健康的人，身體的抵抗力相當強，或者是曾經注射過預防針，所以中然已經有細菌進入身體，可是却沒有臨床的症候。這兩種表面雖然健康而實際帶有細菌的人，對社會非常危險，因爲他能夠將病菌傳給另外的健康人。</p>
<p>傷寒的傳染路徑，正是合乎我們所常說的：「病從口入」，細菌都由水，食品，手指和食具直接地或間接地進入到人們的消化系統。</p>
<p>水是傳染中很重要的部分，因爲水時常和大小便接觸河渠井泉重的水染有病菌斬機會最多，城市裏的自來水管因爲和陰清水管相並行，假如有裂縫時，自來水也可能成爲傳染媒介，所以飲用生水總有獲得傳染病的危險的。</p>
<p>在食物方面，牛奶因爲是很好的傷寒菌的培養料，同時桿菌在牛奶裏生長後，並不發後顯著的變化，不容易被飲用的人所察覺，所以很容易傳播傷寒菌大多來自牛奶塲中帶有病菌的工人，或者來自的傷寒病的訂戶，從這些病家牛奶瓶把細菌帶了出來。除牛奶外，生茶和貝　類食物，也可能爲傳染的來源。水菓，瓜類，和生水，蒼蠅有維不開的關係，所以很有傳染的危險。蒼蠅自然是最使人害怕的，他把細菌從糞便中機械地附着在他的毛脚上然後分布到食物中去，或者直接地送到我們的嘴唇上，這樣加速了傳染的蔓延。</p>
<p>手指和食具，由於和病人接觸，或者因爲碰到生水和蒼蠅，所以很容易間接地作爲傳染的媒介。</p>
<p>傷寒桿菌進入了口腔以後，便經胃而到達腸管的淋巴組織，因爲細菌的增生，所以局部淋巴組織發生腫脹現象。從腸系膜淋巴管，細菌進入血液循環，所以在發病第一週裏，我們就可以從病人血液裏培養出傷寒桿菌，腎臟被侵犯後，細菌可從血液移行到泌尿系統，所以我們時常可以在病人小便裏找到細菌。在腸管方面，等到腸淋巴組織潰壞以後，大便裏就有大　的傷寒菌存在着。這些病菌隨大便排出病人身體後，又開始傳染到另一個健康人去，或者被消滅。</p>
<p>胆囊是一個最適膈於傷寒桿菌生長繁殖的處所，桿菌在胆囊繁殖後，就繼續不斷地和胆汁一同流到小腸，再從腸管隨同大便排出體外。傷寒桿菌的到達胆囊，有兩個可能的途徑：一是從小腸逆流胆管而上以達胆囊；第二是從血液經肝臟循環而達胆囊。胆囊中的傷寒桿菌是很難清除的，一直到現在，醫藥界裏還沒有找到適當可以消滅胆囊中的桿菌的藥物。在目前，惟一的辦法，祇有施行外科胆囊割除術。</p>
<p>關於傷寒症的預防，可以分作三方面來進行，第一是處理帶菌者；第二是切斷傳染的途徑；第三是增強個人抵抗力。</p>
<p>處理帶菌者的辦法，是先找出帶菌的人，然後探求帶菌者的傳染部分，再予以適當的治療，帶菌者可能是表面健康的人或者就是病人，傳染的部分可能是胆囊，或者是腸管或者是泌尿系統。對於每一個傷寒症初愈的病人要經過一個相當長的觀察時期，一直到確切證明不再帶菌時爲止，這是需要病家和衛生工作者的密切合作。</p>
<p>切斷傳染途徑的方法可以分爲一，熟煮一切飲食，二，撲滅蒼蠅，三，消毒一切病人接觸過的物件和排洩物，四，精密的消毒自來水供應，五，檢查廚師和工人是否帶菌者。</p>
<p>增強人抵抗力的方法是除了平日注意個的衛生外，更施行預防注射。菌苗就是殺死的傷寒桿菌。注入皮下組織後，能使身體產生一種對傷寒桿菌的抗體。這種抗體能夠幫助人體撲滅侵入身體的傷寒菌。預防針通常分三次注射，每次間隔七天，注射後血液裏的抗體濃度漸漸遞增。祇注射一次或二次或者兩次注射間相隔日子太久，都足以影響抗體的產生，在傷寒流行的區域裏，預防針是應該每年都注射一次的。</p>
<p>總結起來，我們可以說，對於傷寒病原菌的知識，已經相當地充分。細菌本身性態，傳染的方式和預防的方法，在這幾方面，細菌學者和流行病學家已經盡了他們最大的努力。現在的問題就是「行」。如何地去撲滅傷寒症的流行，不祇是個人衛生的問題，公共衛生當局的努力如何，實在具有重大的決定性。</p>

<p>— 王家睦</p>
<p>傷寒爲一急性傳染病，因爲腸部淋巴組織病變，引起全身病症，故亦名腸熱症。昔希臘醫界鉅于　Hippocratas　氏，曾敘述此原病症。十八世紀中葉，將此種病症歸列一族，爲傷寒類病症。吾國古醫亦有傷寒論，其意養大略相同，皆醫學發展中之陳舊歷史。至十九世紀，漸使該病症與他種發燒香迷病症分離確定。</p>
<p>一八八〇年　Eberth　從病人死　之脾贓及腸系膜之淋巴腺中，　找到此病症之病原體——傷寒桿菌。同時Robert　Koch　氏從　　材料切片染郵包之，其後1884　年　Zaffky將傷寒桿菌培養于人　培養基上並與其他腸中Gr.am　　氏染色陰性桿菌公辦清楚。傷害桿菌爲細小桿菌1-3n　長0.5-0.8n　寬。Gram氏染色爲陰性，芽胞，能行動，有鞭毛八至十四，遍佈全身，在普遍之培養基上能生長，爲需氣菌與兼性厭氣菌，能分解葡萄糖，麥芽糖，及甘露醇等。乾燥殺菌須一至二日，濕熱殺菌55℃一小時60℃須一刻鐘至二十分鐘，在淨水中，在生冷食物中，甚至在冰塊中，可經月不死。</p>
<p>此種桿菌傳染於人體後一二星期即發病，發病初期於，病茵在血液中。一週後，在病人小便大便中，均可找到該種桿菌。</p>
<p>曾經患此病症而痊癒者，其身體內即含有對該病症之抵抗力，而不易再感染此種病症，此謂之免疫。1908年Russel即利用此種現旬作人工免疫。即注射少量已殺死傷害桿菌於人體中，使不患病症而得對於該病症之免疫力。經多次羣腫及軍隊中之試用結果，甚爲良好，迄今吾人仍用此法，以防免此病。合格之傷寒疫苗，應係止含有Ⅵ抗原之菌種製成。正確注射方法（三劑量法，第一次半公撮第二三次各一公撮，每次間隔時間爲五——七日）所得之免疫力，可維持二年至三年。第二次免疫注射，亦可用皮內注射，用十分之公撮疫苗，注于皮內一次即可。</p>

<h3 id="c156">傷寒致死的主因：佯發症 <a href="#c156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>— 薜死傷</p>
<p>併發症與俗稱「病上　病」或「轉病」有相仿的意思，譬如俗傅「　轉痢　藥醫」一說，雖然不符科學原現，但其顯示「轉病」凶險之意思，則與科學併發症之嚴重學理，有異曲同菌之感。</p>
<p>值此夏令時節，傷寒盛行，況今年　交初夏，而患者已顯此往年衆多，將來死亡數字，必致驚人！若追究傷寒死亡原因，則出於併發症者佔共大半，蓋傷寒此病最易併發許多重症；其併發病或見於受染小腸部份，或因體內受菌盡而發生各部中毒現象等等，併發症之發生，則多見於病發第二三週，茲將各併發症候之微象，擇其要者，按其重要性，依次列舉於生，以供病家之參考，而免無枉之不測！</p>
<p>（一）腸穿破</p>
<p>腸穿破爲傷寒致死主因之一，病例男子較女子多見，然兒童則鮮有，此症最常見於重傷寒病人之第三週，微象來臨可如雷霆炎之速，患者　覺腹部劇痛，常以右下角最甚，繼之作哎，體溫下降而脈搏及呼吸反增，病者恒　轉床上，呼痛不已！面部表現之泊切，及痛楚清狀之緊張·每使旁侍者不知所措，頃刻間，滿腹劇痛有增元減，其後腹部膨脹如鼓，體溫轉高，病者焦急，擅動不停，冷汗遍體，精疲力盡，呈現處脫現象！斯時也，病家如未主醫不當，或因求神求鬼而延誤，則患才衰竭，一息奄奄，不久於人世矣！發病初期，醫師診察時除上述病象以外，尚有腹肌號　，屬部　　，其後腹部膨脹，大量充氣，滿腹觸痛，而　急性腹膜炎之症狀矣！</p>
<p>（　出血）</p>
<p>出畝亦爲傷寒嚴重併發症這一，其胸險程度，與了血量成正比例，病發數佔傷寒病人百人之七八，而患者多係成人，腸出血司發生於傷寒第三週之初期，如出血微少，則除大使呈柏油黑色外，可無其他現象發見，如大量出血，則病人熱度驟降，竟有至正常以下者，脈搏細速，血壓低降，呼吸淺急，臉色慘白，四肢冷濕，血液檢騐則紅血球素減少，病者疲弱焦急，或輾轉不寗，嚴重者，則進入休克如不得適當治療，或出血接連不斷，則後果凶險，生死難測矣！</p>
<p>（三）急性胆囊炎</p>
<p>胆囊炎屬傷寒之重要併發症，但受患者不多，故不如腸穿破與腸出血之注重，患者則於腹右上部感覺驟痛，有時發冷，嘔吐，熱度增高，脈搏加束，腹痛連續不發不等，但以右上部爲主要部位，觸之甚痛，並腹肌強直，其後黃膽畢顯，則診斷無疑矣，重才症狀日益增加，腹右上部有高凸現象，斯時膽囊實已極度膨脹，如不急速求醫，則有　破及發生腹膜炎之可懼。</p>
<p>（四）肺炎</p>
<p>傷寒病程中肺炎併發，亦爲嚴重之症候，或爲枝氣管肺炎，或爲大葉肺炎，症象殆無一定，發冷，發抖，熱度增高，胸部劇痛，呼吸急促，層　　緊，咳嗽痰中得绣色等，均　常見之現象。</p>
<p>（五）血栓形成</p>
<p>靜脈血管之血栓梗塞，賺無有上述之嚴重，但亦所常見，噯患之處，以左處股靜脈最多，病者往往於復元期間，感覺左麗或左腿內側腫痛，動作不便，觸之則皮下有耶索形之硬塊，且有微前，此即所謂股靜脈血栓形成是也，血栓形成本身並無嚴重性，但如局部觸撲赤量，以致小塊血栓脫落，而由血液傅流至肺動脈栓塞時可致人死命。</p>
<p>（六）其他併發症</p>
<p>傷寒之其他併發症；如心內膜炎，必肌炎，心包炎，傷寒菌性腦膜炎，腮腺炎腎臟炎，膀胱炎，骨膜炎，骨髓炎，中耳炎，脚氣，神志錯迷等，均可發現，但屬罕觀，無需公述。</p>
<p>（七）復發</p>
<p>穀說疾病復發，必倍加重，然傷寒不然。臨床經騐所知，境域時症狀大多較累，歴時亦較短，境域出現於熱度退後一二星期，多者亦可至三星期，因此，病者凡在復原期，內，切勿動作或增食過急，以致欲速而反不達。</p>
<p>綜上所述，擇其症狀之要者，簡爲分析如下：（一）腹部驟然劇痛不已——腸穿破之重要症象！</p>
<p>（三）糞便栢油黑色或大量便血（非痔瘡出血者）——腸出血現象</p>
<p>（三）熱度驟降，而貓步鬍鬚反增，腸出血或腸穿孔之重要症狀！</p>

<p>— 喬樹民</p>
<p>假使世界上真的有「瘟神」存在着，那便是「帶菌者」了。</p>
<p>帶菌者又名「菌郵」（Carrier），是身體內帶有某種病菌的人們，自己毫無病症，却可傳染疫病於他人，正是損人而不利已。</p>
<p>在自然界中，吾人所發現的致病微生物，已有二百五十種之多，大多不能登煤獨立生活或長久生存於外界，而需要托庇求蔭於人或動物。動物之貯菌播疫，容待另期討論，今天先說一說人的問題。</p>
<p>病茵入人體，在各各占條件適合的情形下，足以致人於病，這是大家所習知的事。但是，疾病的症狀之累重隱　，千差萬別，猶如特理學上的光帶一般，可以有若干輕重不同的程度。嚴重者，不旋踵而死亡：稍重者，呻吟於床褥：較累才，可以逍遙於戶外：更累者，臨床醫師不能辦認（Subclinical　cases）：最輕者，如無半點徵象，所謂「健康帶菌者」是也。從治療的立塲而論，自以重症病　爲重要，爲需要特別照顧：伹從預防的立塲而論，則其重要性適得其反。因爲　　病人，或四方而　進，試住院而臥床，行動受有限，傳播疫病的機會因而減少：即使行動上無大限制，人咸知其爲平病人，亦皆知所防範與離　。獨此帶菌者與極累性的患者，行勘旣無拘無束，他人又毫無戒心，常爲傳播疫病的主要來源，謂爲「播疫使者」或「瘟神」，認曰不宜？</p>
<p>本期以介紹傷寒的知識爲主，請以一「傷寒帶菌者」的故事爲例證。</p>
<p>一九〇一年，美國有一家的女廚司名呌魔力賣弄（Mary　Mallon）她患了傷寒，不幸而痊復（在那時候，對於別人是不幸的，閱後便知），一個月後，這家洗衣婦也染了傷寒。　年，魔力賣弄換到別家去做菜，妙到了才兩個禮拜，妓院有的洗衣婦也被染了傷寒：隨後家，接連着有七個人染上傷寒。</p>
<p>到了一九〇四年，她又跑到長島（Long　Isand）一家人家當廚司，這家共有七個僕役，却有四個染得傷寒。</p>
<p>一九〇六年，她又抱到別家去工作，這家共用十一口人，在短短的一個禮拜之內，其中彰有六個人被傳染上傷寒。這時，魔力　弄才第一次　人　疑着有命傅病的嫌疑。所以她只子再換個主子，誰知她去了不過半個月，妓院有的洗衣女又爲傷寒病倒了。</p>
<p>一九〇七年好跑地紐約一家做工，不到兩個月，又是兩個人被染上傷寒。所以這五年來，直接由她傳染的傷寒病人，不下二十六例。</p>
<p>紐約衛生局乃於一九〇七年三月十九日，拘禁魔力賣弄於一醫院內，使她勿再在社會上傳染別人，在院中三年，糞便檢查，常常發現含有大量傷寒桿菌。但她不耐院中孤寂，趁　兔脫，不知所往，直至一九一四年，她又被扁於紐約之Sloane婦人醫院，仍充廚役·一九一五年春，該院即發現傷寒流行，凡二十五例，以醫護人員爲主。魔力賣弄顯有重大嫌疑，遂請假出街，一去不返，更姓改名，查如黃鶴。嗣經衛生局多方偵查，才又被拘禁。</p>
<p>其後，流行病學的調查，發與魔力賣弄除傳染上述之病例外，並曾傳染別人多起；而紐約一九〇三年的傷寒大流行（共一千三百餘例係給水無言所致），亦爲此魔力賣弄所惹起。</p>
<p>「瘟神下界，人畜遭殃」。像魔力賣弄這船的帶菌者，在中國正不知有多少。能對一年四季，傷寒到處流行。怎樣取締和管理帶菌者，固然要案賢能的敵府；如何小心防範，還是在乎大家自己，「病從中入」，　亂如此，傷　亦然！</p>

<p>一位翔留學英國專攻文史的朋友，最近来信說是在倫敦博物棺裏面見到寫本的古陽關曲，信内並且抄錄占本的詞句。</p>
<p>在學術土，這可說是一件極有價值的發現。據朋友来信說，這個膺人寫本原出敦煌石窟，爲斯坦因西城考古時所得。我们久知甘違的敦煌是東洋藝術史上有名的聖地，這個唐人寫本大概是由唐宋以来的隊商或戍卒带往西睡去的。</p>
<p>王維的渭城曲誠陽關曲，原題「送元二使安西」，在唐代已經普遍流行，爲民間盛行演唱的一支名歌。我们細讀原持，但覺詞旨凄婉，音韻腿綿，爲王維一生天機流露之作。那時正常承平之貢，俗小四雍容謳吟，詩人每一詞出，立即傅播四方，無論公私飲　，曲院優伎，争相演唱，蔚篇風氣。白氏長慶集有句云：「最愉隔敌唱，珍珠一串歌！」宋榭　得也說：「唐人餞别，必歌陽關三疊。」這可見陽關曲在唐代洗行的普遍了。</p>
<p>不過所謂「三疊」的唱法，逮在宋代好像已經失了傅受，流行的唱法已經不是「古調」了．東坡志林說：「舊傅陽關三疊，然今世人歌時，每句再疊而已。若通一首言之，又进四疊，皆非是也。余在密州，有文勳長官「以事至密，自︸云得古本陽關，其聲宛轉凄斷，不類向之所聞。每句再唱，而第一句不疊，乃知唐本三疊蓋如此。」這所謂每句再唱而第一句不疊，舆现存偷敦博物館中之唐人寫本顯有遠異，唐人寫本是這樣的</p>
<p>謂城朝南置輕慶，過累　，客舍青青柳色親。勸君更盡一杯酒，西出陽關無故人。（一疊）</p>
<p>謂城朝　　輕慶，客舍青青柳色新。柳色親，勸君更盡一杯酒，西出陽關無故人。（二疊）</p>
<p>謂城　閑浥輕慶，客舍青青柳色，新。　君更盡一杯酒一杯灑下，西出陽關無故人。（三疊）</p>
<p>可見唐人寫本的古陽關曲，前三句每句只叠末三字，而第四句不疊，這不但舆蘇軾的說法不同，即與田藝衡的阴關三疊圆謂中所言「連環三叠」「貫珠三疊」等無一柤同。復次，我們现在所能知曉的僅是三疊的唱法，至於古本的「曲譜」刻更無從考證。唐代陽關曲的歌唱，大概是用琵琶和的，這從昔人詩中所謂：「爺娘需利妾身輕，一曲琵琶萬里行；彈到陽關齊拍乎，术知原是断腸　！」可爲明證。</p>
<p>古陽關曲是用琵琶和的，而琵琶的曲譜又似已失傅。這使我已及當民國十六年夏，偶在北平清華學校與先師梁任公先生言及陽關三疊的曲譜問題，乍時任公先生曾有請趙元在任先生作一新曲之議。後因王國維先生以身殉道，任公先生匆匆離校，水木清華　單一層深深的憂　，元任先生終未完成此曲，及今思之，不覺惘然！</p>

<p>— 應悱村</p>
<p>枕頭旁，飲水思源幽幽地：</p>
<p>「我看還是出去的好，不比從前時候住在鄉下，人家總說你志氣高，骨頭硬，不肯吃東洋人飯；現在勝利了，再要等下去，給人家看了，算什麼呢？外面總有個把可托的朋友的。」</p>
<p>「唔，我早就想走了。」</p>
<p>是決定就要動身的了。妻子蹲在床前地板上整理箱子，丈夫抱着最小的一個女兒旁觀二個兒子在認方塊字玩。</p>
<p>妻子照例又是幽幽地：</p>
<p>「幾雙襪子，我都給你補好了。你這個人呀，襪子不知道在怎麼穿的？雙雙都是破在前頭，這樣大的人，足指甲長了也應該知道修剪修剪的呀。」</p>
<p>他回頭俯視她一眼，她也正在仰首向他作幽怨的一瞥，視線一相接，她的長睫毛裏的幽怨的眼立刻轉爲微笑了。他也微笑起來。</p>
<p>「你笑什麼？」她問。</p>
<p>「你笑什麼？」他問。</p>
<p>「我笑你「懶是懶，足指甲像　鏟。」」</p>
<p>「我笑你這樣忙着給我預　出門，我可是——」</p>
<p>「可是什麼呢？」</p>
<p>「連出門的用資都還沒有着落哪。」</p>
<p>於是妻低下頭，嘆口氣：「丈夫的回答。</p>
<p>從家裏到上海，大概要多少錢？」</p>
<p>「多少？到舟山五千，舟山到寗波大約也是五千，寗波到上海統艙也要一萬多元，外加飯錢車錢等待，一共總得毛四萬罷」</p>
<p>「四萬？」妻睜大了眼。</p>
<p>沈默一陳以後，她像得到解決的辦法似的說：「唉，還欠一萬。」</p>
<p>「出門實在不大容易，就算我可以動身了，家裏怎麼辦呢？」</p>
<p>「這倒不要你愁。前天買了石半米，我們娘兒四個總有二三個月好　，小菜末，有幾　鹹黃魚醃着。也不成問題。再半月就要開校了。薪水領來做做另用大概夠了。愁只愁你還欠一萬元，到了上海，不知道有事做沒事做。」</p>
<p>突然——</p>
<p>「阿漢，啊，鄭小姐。」一個宏亮的聲音伴着一個高大的漢子進門來。</p>
<p>主婦急忙立起來，夫妻四雙眼睛望定了來客。</p>
<p>「喲，我道是誰？是王先生呀。」</p>
<p>「哦，志康哥。想不到會是你！你怎麼會到這兒來？」</p>
<p>「我是從上海辦發批貸色裝到海門去的。真湊巧，風向不對，帆船會停泊在這兒。我知道你住在這兒，特地上岸來看看你，一等風向轉南，我就要下船去的。你們好？阿漢，你在此地做了四年隱士，現在也該出去活動活動了。」</p>
<p>「是呀，王先生，他明後天就預備到上海去了。你看，我正在給他理行李呢。」</p>
<p>「你們有幾個小寶寶了？這幾個都是的？」</p>
<p>「三個了」。丈夫回答：「志康哥，還是你，能文能武，做生意總很廉錢　。」</p>
<p>「比教書自然要好一些，你當初聽我說改了行就好啦。」</p>
<p>「做生意一口風一口浪，也怪辛苦的。」妻插進來，她在給客人倒茶。</p>
<p>「我倒很喜歡過這種生活。三位小寶寶，幾歲了？」</p>
<p>妻說：「大的才六歲，第二個五歲，抱着那個才二歲。阿芒，阿朝，你們呌聲伯伯呀。」</p>
<p>孩子們羞怯怯地：「伯伯」。輕得自己也聽不分明。</p>
<p>「好，好，乖，乖，阿漢，兒女成行，福氣倒好，要是，鄭小姐，不是我說笑話，你們有三個也很夠了，以後要對勾節制資本了，哈哈。來，給伯伯抱一抱看」。大漢從朋友手中奪過女孩來：「　，乖呀，笑笑看，好」。他左手挾着小孩，右手從長衣袋裏擈出幾張鈔票來：「哪，一個人二張，伯伯給你們買糖吃」。</p>
<p>夫妻異口同聲：「這算什麼」？父親想從孩子們手中奪回鈔票，孩子　捏得比什麼寶貝牢。大漢揮着手：「又不是給你的，叫你客氣什麼呀」？</p>
<p>之後，互相帶着感慨談了陳別後彼此以及與彼此有關的朋友的近況，看看外面的天，朋在說：風向恐怕就要轉變，船隨時就要開行，看見過了安心了，現在必須走了。主要怎麼也留不住，一陣「再見」之聲又伴着這高天的漢子走了。</p>
<p>「姆媽，哪，那位伯伯給我四千元」大孩子得間地高揚鈔票到娘前。</p>
<p>「我也四千」，二兒子也頗昂然。</p>
<p>「寶貝也四千」。小女孩自稱爲寶貝，發音不清，小圓臉綻開了笑。</p>
<p>丈夫嘆口氣：「這年頭連小孩子也那麼拜金主義了」。</p>
<p>「來」，母親拉住大孩子的手：「你們都是乖囡，鈔票給姆媽」。</p>
<p>「嗯，我要買皮球的」。大的說，捏鈔票的右手藏在背後，側着頭。</p>
<p>「我要買葱管糖的」。第二個貪　。</p>
<p>母親哄着他們：「爹爹明天到上海去了，我們鈔票叫爹爹帶去，叫爹爹去買小皮鞋，小皮鞋才好看呢」。</p>
<p>「好，好，小皮鞋？小皮鞋」！二兄弟信以爲真，歡天喜地的。</p>
<p>「寶貝也要小皮鞋」。小女兒指着足上的破布鞋：「宵好」。</p>
<p>「好的，一個一雙，一共二雙。爹爹不要忘記呀。現在你們就把鈔票給姆媽。」</p>
<p>三個孩子立刻像「什麼獻金」似的搶着把他們唯一的私有財產呈獻給母親了。</p>
<p>那晚上，妻把一束鈔票塞入丈夫的西裝袋，她笑笑斜　着丈夫說：「有了職業領到薪水，別忘記孩子們的小皮鞋呵」。</p>
<p>丈夫看着妻的無名指上已失去那隻金戒，再看看三個孩子夢裏的嬌　的笑容，他的眼圈紅了起來。……</p>

<p>— 作獻</p>
<p>復員聲中我國樂壇的動態，爲新文化界所關心，茲將調查所得，作簡略報告如次：</p>
<p>團體方面，國立音樂院（原址在重慶青木關）已開始東遷。該院爲我國最高音樂學府，以設於首都爲原則，惟南京未易筧得適當院舍，故決定暫遷往常州，以該地前日本學校爲院舍。院長吳伯超氏與一道聽途份教員已乘舟來滬，現在途中；另一部份學生則乘公路草經西安而來，不日可以抵達常州。</p>
<p>重慶除國立音樂院外，有國立音樂分院，由載粹倫氏主持。勝利後該分院改爲國立上海音樂專科學校，定暑期內遷移來滬。前上海國立音專在市中心區之校舍，現爲日浮營，內部破壞甚多，正常基能否修復應用，尙有問題。</p>
<p>上海臨時大學補習班第三分班（即音樂班）補習將屆滿期，下月即可結束。結束後該班學生及格者分別插入國立各音樂學校。</p>
<p>國立福建音樂專科學校原設於永安，校長爲唐學　氏。勝利後該校遷至福州，暫設於東門外　行村。該校校舍建築費聞已得教育部批准，在福州城內技地與建中。</p>
<p>西北音樂院原在西安，抗戰期內開辦，由趙梅伯氏主持。聞該院擬遷往北平，並改爲國立；趙氏已抵平籌備一切。</p>
<p>私立上海音樂專科學校創辦已有八年，由丁善德陳德陳，又新兩人主持，一　精神其佳，　得社會贊許·　利後　因內部意見不和，宣告停頓，知者無不惋惜。聞歸近或有復辦可能。</p>
<p>上海音樂界　於團結之必要，已組織上海市音樂協會，公推馬思聽氏爲理事長，陳洪·丁善德·曹石峻·鬱忻福·李德倫·許錦清等爲常務理事。該協會已興軒音樂會多次，會址設於馬斯南路三十一號。</p>
<p>上海市政府樂隊前爲工部局旬隊，有四十餘年歷史，隊員六十餘人，演奏成績爲遠東冠。其間曾因經費支絀，陷於停頓狀態。聞歸近該隊主任謝錫恩氏已向市當局設法增加經費繼續辦理。</p>
<p>上海音樂雜誌社爲陳洪丁善德等所組織，以刋行「音樂雜誌」月刋爲目的。該雜誌宣傳已就，姍姍未見出世，近悉尙在校對中。格式爲十六開本，四十餘　，除文字外有五綫譜樂曲。</p>
<p>詩歌音樂協會上海分會內有音樂紐，由馬思聽，陳原二氏負責。</p>
<p>南京勵志社成立管絃樂隊，在滬詔請隊員多人，已開始演奏工作，由朱崇志氏主持。</p>
<p>重慶中華交音樂團擬遷南京。</p>
<p>個人方面，馬思聽氏日內赴粵，少作勾留，將再來滬。</p>
<p>吳伯超在來滬途中，戴粹倫，陳田鶴，江定仙，章彥，勞景堅，滿福民，施義桂諸氏，均在渝候船來滬。</p>
<p>已抵滬者有任正謙，韓中傑，馬思莖，馬思琚，廖輔叔，黃慕理，馬國霖，管喻怡萱等。</p>
<p>鋼琴家李慧芳已赴美深造。將赴美者據悉有女高音郎毓秀。</p>
<p>近兩月來，上海音樂演奏會有空前盛况。計在青年會舉行者有司徒華城小提琴演奏會，惲敏歌唱會，陳正平鋼琴演奏會，齊　羣許綿清聯合歌唱會等。在蘭心戲院舉行者有馬思聰作品演奏會（兩天），音協聯合音樂會（兩天），李英治歌唱会，及行交举行马思宏董光光聯合演奏會等</p>
<p>鋼琴家吳樂　久未出台，聞近在親友慫恿中，有舉行獨奏會可能。統觀上文，可知戰後音樂人將萃會于上海，京滬一帶將成爲中國音樂中心殆爲必然之趨勢。</p>
<h3 id="c162">藝術與怪胎 <a href="#c162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>— 中原</p>
<p>我與一個年累孕婦同住·當她十月滿足臨盆的時刻，我滿心歡喜，以爲將看見一個雪白肥胖的寗聲兒了。不料「啊呀」一聲，那孕婦　出一場外無頭無肢形如石頭的怪特。於是我大失所望，連所嘆息。</p>
<p>藝術的「怪胎」，也是差不多情形。</p>
<p>有人懷疑，爲什麼一般人決把藝術家比作產婦？固然，一件藝術作品的產生，必經過一個想當時間的孕育。可是，一尕美麗的玫瑰花，從含苞到開花，也同樣必經過一個相當時間的孕育。那麼，爲什麼不把藝術家比作更可愛的玫瑰花樹呢？</p>
<p>我想關鍵就在此吧：一尕玫瑰花從樹上摘下，離開母體之後，就立刻枯幹萎謝。而一個嬰兒，呱呱墜地離開母體之後，還是會器會笑，會不斷地生長。</p>
<p>所以，一件藝術作品的必要條件，就是二個字：生命！換名句話說，凡具有生命的，即使外形欠佳，或竟少一隻眼睛，多一隻手指，仍不失爲藝術的嬰兒。反之，像石頭一樣沒有生命的東西，即使牠外形漂亮，頭肢完備，仍只能稱之爲「怪胎」。</p>

<p>— 胡山湖</p>
<p>本文是胡山湖光後對當前文化一種　誠的敘寫，總名苦悶騙內分讀者的苦悶，寫作者的苦悶，編者的苦悶，出版者的苦悶，環境的苦悶等五章。說理　關，分析　嚴，堪供文化工作者參考，今在本刋依次發表。</p>
<p>編者</p>
<p>讀者的苦悶</p>
<p>一切讀物是人們的精神食糧。精神飢餓起來，其難過恐怕比了身體飢餓只有過之無不及。我們在淪陷的八年中，飽受了精神的飢餓，因爲在敵僞的統制下，是沒有什麼有益分身心的精神食糧的。飲酖止渴的，到底是少數人，知其酖而甘願該較正了，那就是說，精神飢渴的人，就應該有適當的食糧了，不料將近一年來，事實上却並不如　。</p>
<p>我們回顧這將近一年來的出版界，就可以知道這種食糧的缺少。居全國出版第一位的各大書局，出了什麼書？沒有！有的也只是後方運來的幾本，不是過了時，便是薄薄基本，不經咬嚼。大書局如此，小書居更不必說，關門的關門，改持的改持，否則就以出售文具或其他花花綠綠的東西來維持牠分道揚鑣塲面。雜誌界似乎熱鬧些。但黃色刋特居其大部份，這就成了酖，不足以作爲精神食糧，不是黃色的，則可以分作二大類：一類是宣傳品，歪曲的理論，歪曲的記載，不一廁瞳，去酖也不聽·一類是商業品，雖然還不致變黃，甚至也有一些可以成爲正當糧食的作品在內，但究竟以商業爲目的，就是以　錢爲目的，給人吃下去，總不會完全有益身心，一個不小心，還不免夾雜一些酖的成份在內。完全合乎標準的，當然不是沒有，可是也真成了鳳毛麟角，大大地不夠！再看報紙，當今的報紙，誰知道：宣傳第一，越來娛樂第一，注意到讀塲精神的，也是少數之少數。同時，看報紙的也許只想知道一些消息，並不想在牠的上面找尋精神食糧，於是報紙就與人們的精神絕緣。有幾張副刋，也許不以宣傳或娛樂爲目的，但仍和雜誌一樣，到底有幾張呢？學不是若虹星之寥寥！</p>
<p>我們讀者現在正處於極端苦悶的境地！我們精神上飢餓，我們要食糧。但我們鐵匠不到欕民之物。我們不願意吃毒物，也不願意別人吃毒物。但我們有什麼辦法呢？我們飢餓將到何時才終止呢？</p>
<p>我們將怪誰？第一個，我們就要層寫作者，爲什麼他們憑着寫作的技能與便利，不給我們以正當的精神糧食！他們不是不懂何者爲正當，何者爲不正當，而他們竟抹殺了良心，拼命顛倒黑白，妄作宣傳，或者拉倒以騙稿費爲目的，只求稿子有銷路，而忽視了一個寫作者應有的使命　他們是敗類，文化界的　賊，我們要聲討！要驅逐！我們要他們某面洗心，製造出正當的精神食糧來！</p>
<p>讀者的苦悶是完全要寫作者負責的！</p>

<p>— 趙清閣</p>
<p>昨天夜裏，麗華把登台唱戲的事想得很泰然，她抱業像應付每日必修課程一樣地應付登台唱戲的事。她覺得沒有什麼分別。</p>
<p>今天，麗華的生命開始走到一個新的階段。</p>
<p>張弦一手牽著麗華，一手牽着願雲，進了戲園子的後台，墨太太和翁二太太替他們提着「行頭」包，跟在後面。後台的人們凡認得張弦的，都來點頭招呼。有的還向他恭喜着，說：「弦字」，（張弦的綽號呌弦子，又指胡琴弦子。）該忙起來了！」張弦直一個勁地邪着眼睛笑。就在石玉樓化裝的屋角，一張小前前停下來，讓兩小姊妹笑着。一面呌人替他們打臉水；　一面自己忙着替西替他們擺到桌子上。</p>
<p>後台亂得團糟，男男女女，擠擠擁擁，「嘰嘰喳喳，」都是三分像人七分像鬼的，沒有一個是衣冠楚楚，相貌堂堂。加上屋子裏昏沉沉的，在暗淡的燈光之下，幌來幌去些個臉塗着五顏六色的魔影，手裏還拿槍執刀看上去，真呌人不臉悚然之感！</p>
<p>「這是什麼地方呢？屋不是屋，東一塊木板西一塊木板，隔成了幾個小鴿子籠。人不是人·怪模怪樣，怪聲怪氣的。」麗華想着看着這個陌生環境，心裏煩得很，也怕得很！但，盡管牠是人間地獄吧，墨太太　然把她送到這裏來了，她就只有呆下去！呆下去！於是她索興閉起民眼睛，不再望一切。任張弦擺弄着她，像擺弄着一個小木偶，小傀儡。</p>
<p>麗雲却不似麗華那麼多感，好看一切，問一切，她姨一切發生一種新奇的興趣。當張弦替她代裝的時候，她又愉快的注視着她自己，她覺得她自己的模樣全變了，連她自己都是好玩兒的。</p>
<p>舞台上的鑼鼓響了，這呌做「鬧台」一過，先是一　班底的墊戲，墊戲完了，該着麗雲的「捉放曹」上塲。張弦先囑咐了她一邊，然後趕到前台去爲她拉胡琴。</p>
<p>麗雲從空不近地登台了，可是當她一眼看見台底下池子裏黑鴉鴉地坐滿了看她的人時，她不禁有些慌了！「塲面（平劇的配奏樂隊謂之爲「塲面」·）重覆了兩編，張弦急的直跺腳暸眼睛半響，麗去才慢慢霍夫鎮靜，開了口，但是好已經不自知地遺忘了好幾句詞兒。但總算湊合着唱下去了。回到後台，她趕快告訴麗華，說：「池子裏黑鴉鴉的人看着我，好可怕呀！嚇得我把唱詞兒都給忘了。」</p>
<p>麗華聽了這話毫無表示，他似乎「胸有成竹」的樣子。</p>
<p>張弦又趕到後台，把那個麗華配演「游龍戲鳳」，飾正德皇帝的人介紹給麗華，並關照那人呌多多的躭待，必要時替提着點兒詞兒。張弦對於麗華登台的事，比較，特別地關心些。因爲他在麗華的身上，抱着很大的希望。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Three-Man Committee Continues Off-Committee Negotiations, Marshall Visited the Chairman Yesterday for a Long Talk, Third Party Efforts to Mediate <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 27th] After learning of the CCP's counter-proposal to the military reorganization plan, Special Envoy Marshall visited Chairman Chiang this morning for consultations, which lasted for three hours. In the afternoon, Zhou Enlai visited Marshall twice, the first time from 1:30 PM to 4:00 PM and the second time from 6:00 PM to 9:00 PM. The content of the talks was still focused on finding a compromise between the opinions of the government and the CCP. According to informed sources, the government cannot accept the CCP's counter-proposal, and the CCP cannot agree to the government's plan. The gap between the two sides' opinions is still wide, so the current focus remains on off-committee negotiations. With only two and a half days left until the ceasefire deadline, if off-committee negotiations are successful, the formal meeting will only take a few hours to complete. People in Nanjing are showing anxiety about the repeated adjournments of the Military Three-Man Committee, but qualified observers generally believe that the two sides can be brought closer to each other's opinions before the weekend, and there is still a possibility that the overall situation will improve.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 27th] The Third Party, feeling the imminent expiration of the ceasefire deadline, is rushing to mediate. At 3:00 PM today, discussions were held at Lanjiazhuang. In addition to representatives of the Democratic League, Mo Dehui and Chen Qi were also present. The talks ended at 6:00 PM. The content of the talks covered general issues, but the main focus was on hoping that both sides could make more concessions on their military reorganization proposals, so that the three issues discussed during the ceasefire period could be resolved satisfactorily. The Third Party also plans to schedule another meeting with government representatives tomorrow to promote the convergence of opinions between the two sides, and is also considering continuing to meet with Special Envoy Marshall to exchange views.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 27th] The Military Three-Man Committee will continue to adjourn tomorrow. This news was released at 11:00 PM tonight.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 27th] According to a certain authoritative source, the government's recently proposed new military reorganization plan is based on repeated concessions and revisions. The government has made great efforts in designating the garrison areas for the Communist troops inside and outside the Guannei. Although it has not been confirmed that the government is demanding that the CCP abandon Harbin, Qiqihar, Andong, and six other garrison areas in the Northeast, and abandon Rehe, Jiaodong, and the three strategic areas of northern Jiangsu in Guannei, the people in the above-mentioned provinces and regions have expressed dissatisfaction. The Communist Party should take this as a warning and not further burden the people and seize land, trust in power and forget justice, and bring the country to a point of no return. Also, it is reported that off-committee activities of the Military Three-Man Committee will end tomorrow. If there are results by then in the morning, there is a possibility of holding a meeting in the afternoon.</p>
<h3 id="e2">The CCP's Counter-Proposal for Military Reorganization Is Far From the Topic <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 27th] According to sources, the CCP's counter-proposal to the government's military reorganization plan includes the following three principles: (1) Using politics to control the military, ensuring people's freedom, government democracy, and rural reform; (2) Joint military-civilian governance, with the garrison areas of both sides' troops concentrated in spots rather than scattered over a wide area, concentrating troops in large cities so that villages can expedite their post-war recovery, with the military not interfering in civil administration to avoid the crisis of civil war; (3) Military orders, military administration, and military training should be unified under public management, with unit commanders only responsible for training, and specialized organizational institutions for logistics and supply. Military orders should be uniformly commanded by the reorganized National Government Committee. After the CCP's above-mentioned military reorganization counter-proposal was released, according to a certain neutral source, if the content of the CCP's military reorganization counter-proposal is as described above, then what it says is far from the topic. With only three days left until the final ceasefire deadline, the CCP has not yet put forward correct and reasonable opinions on practical issues that urgently need to be resolved in the military reorganization issue, such as the issue of CCP troop garrison areas, but is merely engaging in beautiful and pleasing rhetoric to deceive the world. Its intention is obviously to "delay." Looking at the first point of the CCP's countermeasure, the so-called "guaranteeing people's freedom," and the second point, the so-called "concentrating troops in major cities so that villages can expedite their post-war recovery," its words are very good, but if the CCP does not turn over a new leaf and thoroughly correct its past mistakes, then the people in the CCP-occupied areas will never have freedom to speak of, and the villages in the CCP-occupied areas will not know when they will be able to recover. As for the third point of the CCP's counter-proposal, saying that military orders should be left to be discussed when the government is reorganized in the future, dragging this into today's negotiations on reorganizing and unifying the army, who would believe that it is not setting up excuses to delay?</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 27th] The Xinminbao reported today that the CCP side proposed a counter-proposal to the CCP's supplementary military reorganization proposal yesterday afternoon, which does not include new demands to expand the garrison in the Northeast.</p>
<h3 id="e3">Letter to Compatriots from the Northern Jiangsu Refugee Group, Demanding that the Communist Party Lay Down Their Arms and Hoping that the Democratic League Will Not Be a Tail <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 27th] The Northern Jiangsu Refugee Homecoming Petition Group recently released a letter to compatriots from all walks of life, appealing to the government, the CCP, society, and compatriots from all walks of life, and putting forward the following demands: (1) The government has the responsibility to protect the people's bodies, property, beliefs, and freedom of residence. We demand immediate return to our hometowns, and demand that the government guarantee our return and guarantee our peaceful and prosperous lives in the future; (2) Political disputes should be resolved politically, but party regimes cannot be used as knives and the common people as meat on the chopping board. We demand that the Communist Party immediately lay down their arms, remove the Communist regime in northern Jiangsu, and immediately declare that they will no longer infringe upon the people's legitimate freedom through illegal means such as struggle, liquidation of the masses, trials, forced conscription, forced comforting, forced donation of money and grain, etc.; (3) We hope that the Democratic League will not speak up for the Communist Party and act as its tail in order to gain political status; (4) We hope that Special Envoy Marshall will not look at the Chinese Communist Party with the eyes of an American political party, because the CCP's behavior endangers the country and constitutes treason, and killing people and demolishing houses constitutes theft and banditry; (5) When the government, political parties, etc., cannot fulfill their responsibility to protect the people, the people have the right to arm themselves for freedom, and must have freedom. In the future, the exiles in northern Jiangsu will, within the scope of small laws, carry out the most effective homecoming and self-help actions.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 27th] After the amnesty case was passed by the Legislative Yuan, a reporter recently visited the content of the amnesty case passed by the Judicial Yuan. It can be said that it is quite lenient to general civil and criminal offenders, but it obviously shows no leniency towards war criminals, traitors, corruption, and drug offenders. After all, amnesty is a national grand ceremony. Although the law is nothing more than human feelings, reasonable application should be the case. According to the various clauses of non-amnesty or reduced sentences listed in item B of the case, all traitors are on the list of non-amnesty or reduction. Only those who conceal and fail to report, or who harbor and condone, and those who deliberately misreport, can apply the amnesty and reduction measures. Those who take bribes are also on the list of non-amnesty and reduction, and those who offer bribes can apply the amnesty and reduction measures. Only drug addicts can use the amnesty and reduction measures, but those who commit the crime a second time are not applicable. According to general estimates, there are currently approximately 700,000 military and civilian criminals in prisons nationwide. After the amnesty order is issued, it is hoped that approximately three-fifths of them will be able to regain their freedom through the grace of the national grand ceremony.</p>

<h3 id="e16">Regarding the Unfortunate Incident in Xiaguan: Six Suspects Sent to Court, Cheng Qiong Tearfully Tells Reporters of Communist Army's Atrocities <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 27th] On the evening of the 23rd, an unfortunate incident occurred in Xiaguan. Eight suspects were arrested on the spot by the Xiaguan Military Police. Except for two of them who were released on bail after interrogation because they were not involved in the beating, the remaining Cheng Qiong, Lu Hong, Yan Yiping, Chen Xishi, Wang Minghua, and Tang Shuhua were escorted to the Military Law Office of the Military Police Headquarters by the Xiaguan Military Police on the night of the 25th. On the afternoon of the 26th, a reporter visited the Military Law Office of the Military Police Headquarters to interview these six people suspected of assault. The following are their statements to the reporter:</p>
<p>Wang Minghua: "He claimed" to be from Yangzhou, Jiangsu, 29 years old, currently living at No. 5 Xianyu Lane, Xiaguan. He works as a measuring clerk at the Ganhexiang Rice Store. After dinner on the 23rd, he went out for a stroll alone. On the way, he heard people talking about the communists from Shanghai giving speeches at the station. Driven by curiosity, he squeezed into the station to watch. It was probably a little after 11 o'clock. He saw many people crowding and shouting to beat the communists. Because he usually hated the communists, he thought they deserved to be beaten, so he shouted along. He was arrested by the military police. He did not beat anyone and did not even see a representative.</p>
<p>Tang Shuhua: "He claimed" to be from Nanjing, 17 years old, currently studying in the first year of junior high school at Daosheng Middle School, living at No. 25 Mishi Street. After dinner at home, he went out for a walk with four classmates. He heard passersby say that there were many people fighting at Xiaguan Station. He panicked and wanted to turn around and avoid it, but was arrested. The other three companions ran away early. He did not see any representatives at all, nor did he hit anyone. The school will have a major exam tomorrow, and his parents are very worried hearing that he was locked up. "Crying" Please let them get me out soon.</p>
<p>Cheng Qiong: He is from Jiancheng, northern Jiangsu, 30 years old, currently temporarily staying at a friend's place at No. 7 Yongning Lane, Xiaguan. He graduated from a senior elementary school and has been unemployed for nearly half a year. In his hometown of Jiancheng, he owned more than 30 mu of land, and his family of seven lived by farming, living a very happy life. Unexpectedly, after Jiancheng was occupied by the New Fourth Army, the situation became very different. They divided Jiancheng into four new counties: Sheyang, Jiancheng, Jianyang, and Jiandong. Your own land would be "struggled against" and given to their county government. Your farming tools had to be taken out for public use. Your wives and sisters had to join the women's team and let the New Fourth Army "struggle against" them. Any literate young people who did not obey them were called "stubborn elements" or "national spies," and they were also "struggled against." He was arrested by the New Fourth Army last October and participated in a model class. He didn't know the situation of the model class at that time. He heard people say that after training, the model class would be formed into a main force. He thought that after eight years of resistance against Japan, it was not easy to defeat Japan. Why should he fight the National Army? Chinese people fighting Chinese people. He decided not to do it, so he asked three local bailiffs to bail him out, willing to farm and help the backstage government to "struggle against" the land of self-cultivating farmers. After leaving the model class, he learned that his family's more than 30 mu of land had been completely "struggled against." He couldn't live in his hometown at all, so he ran away secretly from his family. He went to Shanghai at the end of the year, but couldn't find a job. He went to Wuxi this April and came to Nanjing on June 12 to borrow money from friends. On the afternoon of the 23rd, he was at his residence in Xiaguan. Passing by the station, he heard people say that the communists were coming. He went into the station to take a look. He saw many fellow villagers petitioning the communist representatives. He also went to petition, because he had been unemployed for so long, all because of the New Fourth Army. Of course, he wanted to petition the communists, hoping they would stop fighting and let them go back. When he squeezed close to the representative, the order became chaotic. He was hit several times on the back, and he also hit randomly, and was arrested. His mother and sisters also ran away after he left. They met in Wuxi and learned that the three bailiffs who bailed him out were being punished because he escaped and they couldn't hand him over. His family property was confiscated. His uncle, in February of this year, because he hated the New Fourth Army to the bone, secretly said to others, "It would be great if the Central Army came." He was secretly reported, so the New Fourth Army stripped him naked, tied him up, and made him kneel on a dirt platform one or two zhang high, telling him to "look at the Central Government." After kneeling for a day and a night, they buried him alive at night after taking him down. They cannot go back to their homes now. The Communist Party kills and sets fires, rapes and ravishes the wives and sisters of good people. The state doesn't care. They just hit the communists a few times who deserved to die, and they are breaking the law and facing lawsuits. He hopes the reporters go to Jiancheng to take a look. He decided to risk his life to settle accounts with the Communist Party. He was overwhelmed with grief.</p>
<p>Lu Qi: He is from Yingxian County, 18 years old, a first-year student at Daosheng Middle School, living at No. 218 Huanhe Road. After dinner on the evening of the 23rd, he was resting on a deck chair when he heard people shouting on the street that a New Fourth Army representative was giving a speech at the Guan Station. He hurriedly ran over alone. When he arrived, he saw a lot of people crowded. He saw a few people surrounding a person and beating him. He went up to persuade them, but was arrested as a result. He did not see the representative, nor did he hit anyone.</p>
<p>Yan Yiping: He is from Zhenjiang, living at the Henghe Department Store at No. 48 Xianyu Lane, Xiaguan, working as the store's accountant. Because he often went to the train station, he also went that night. He heard many people shouting to beat the communists. Because he hated the communists, he also shouted along and was arrested. He did not hit anyone.</p>
<p>Chen Xishi: He is from Jiancheng, northern Jiangsu, 25 years old, helping his father farm his own 40 mu of land at home, and also attending private school. After the New Fourth Army occupied Jiancheng, they wanted to "struggle against" his family's land. Seeing that the root of his family's livelihood was about to be taken away, he refused to give it to them for struggle, and was shot dead on the spot by the New Fourth Army. Although he wanted to fight them at the time, he didn't have enough strength. Since there was no food to eat at home, he had to flee. He went to Shanghai, but couldn't find a job. He came to Nanjing on the morning of June 23rd to find friends in Pukou. Returning to Xiaguan Station, he saw many people speaking with a northern Jiangsu accent shouting, "The Communist Party should quickly get out of northern Jiangsu!" "We want to go home!" He was moved for a moment, so he squeezed into the crowd and followed them to petition the communist representatives. The representatives never answered. Someone shouted to beat them, so everyone started fighting, and he was arrested as a result. He didn't expect that after just arriving in Nanjing after being displaced, he would face a lawsuit. He doesn't have a single penny on him now, and he doesn't know where his family is. He really doesn't know what to do.</p>

<p>[U.S. News Service, Washington, 26th] The bill on military assistance to China, which was proposed two weeks ago at the request of Secretary of State Byrnes, was passed by the House Foreign Affairs Committee today by a vote of 15 to 2 and submitted to the House of Representatives. The same bill has been introduced in the Senate. Byrnes said: The legislation in this proposal has been fully agreed to by Special Envoy to China, General Marshall. The goal of the bill is to help the Chinese army become a modern armed force so that it can fulfill its obligations under the United Nations Charter. This legislation will stipulate that the term of assistance is ten years.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 26th] The military assistance to China bill passed by the House Foreign Affairs Committee today stipulates that surplus military equipment will be transferred to China, and a U.S. military delegation will be sent to train the Chinese army. Earlier, Acting Secretary of State Acheson reported to the committee that after the implementation of China's military reorganization plan, the current 375 army divisions will be reduced to 60 divisions. The committee passed this bill in a secret meeting today. Republican Congresswoman Bolton expressed her opposition, saying, "If we do not consider this case carefully and vote on it, it will be very harmful to the future of peace."</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 27th] Foreign News: The United States seeks world peace. Even the work of sending Japanese prisoners and Japanese nationals away from China has been completed. If a peaceful, unified, and strong China has not been realized by then, its military assistance to China will only be strengthened, not weakened, and will not abandon its sacred mission of military assistance to China due to communist anti-American propaganda. The anti-American propaganda launched by Yan'an is not only not fooling the Chinese people, but also has little response in the ideological realm of American communists.</p>
<h3 id="e18">The Capital High Court Publicly Tried the Traitors Lu Ying and Yin Rugeng Yesterday, Former Air Force Colonel Chen Tongxiang Sentenced to Life Imprisonment <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 27th] Lu Ying, the former head of the puppet police bureau who ran rampant in Shanghai during the Anti-Japanese War, was tried in the Capital High Court this morning at 10 o'clock, presided over by Judge Jin Shiding. Lu is from Jiangling, Hubei, 52 years old, and graduated from the second term of the Baoding Military Academy. During the trial, the presiding judge paid special attention to the authority of the puppet police bureau. Lu confessed that the situation in Shanghai was complicated at that time. The public concession, the French concession, and Nanshi all had their own police bureaus. After the puppet government took back the concessions, the mayor concurrently served as the head of the police bureau, and he retreated to the deputy head. He also denied all charges of sheltering gambling dens, selling opium, and publicly bribing. He also argued that he had sent people to Hong Kong to contact Li Wanjun, who assassinated the puppet Foreign Minister Chen Lu in 1941, and rescued him after he was arrested. He also contacted Zhang Huifang's troops of the Loyal and Righteous National Salvation Army. He also claimed that at the end of May 1945, he had ordered a police brigade of 500 people to revolt in preparation for acting as guides during the counterattack, and that he had never harmed anti-Japanese personnel. The presiding judge said that what he said was all empty talk without any evidence, and allowed him to state again any events that were beneficial to him. Lu lowered his head and pondered for a long time. Suddenly, with a face full of joy, he claimed that there were also two things he had done: establishing a civilian hospital in Nanjing and raising donations for education. Lu's son, Cheng Bin, hired lawyer Xia Anxiu to defend his father. Lawyer Xia put forward points such as criminal psychology, serving the central government, and the Li Wanjun incident to defend him, and requested a retrial, but it was not approved. The verdict will be announced at 2 pm on July 3. Lu has one wife, two concubines, and seven children. One concubine has already run away.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 27th] Yin Rugeng, the veteran traitor who was escorted to Beijing from Pingjin, was publicly tried by the Capital High Court at 2 pm on the 27th in front of 2,000 spectators. The first courtroom of the High Court once again presented the lively scene of the public trials of the traitors Lin Bosheng and Mei Sipin. Correspondents from Central News Agency, photographers, and broadcasters also gathered. At 3 pm, Judge Zhao Chen, associate judges Ge Zitan and Jin Shiding, and prosecutor Wang Wenjun took the stand. Yin, wearing a lake-colored silk long gown and Chinese-style leather casual shoes, was in the defendant's dock. The lawyers he hired were Ge Shizhao, Duanmu Kai, and Zhang Wenbo, but only Lawyer Zhang arrived today. After asking for his name, age, and place of origin, the prosecutor read out the indictment, detailing Yin's various acts of colluding with the enemy and betraying the country since 1935. The defendant seemed to have difficulty hearing due to his hearing impairment, and he often trembled. The presiding judge then consulted with the prosecutor for a moment on the trial procedure, and then began to investigate the evidence, questioning Yin's origin, education, and the circumstances before and after his betrayal of the country. The defendant initially emphasized that he himself joined the Tongmenghui when he studied in Japan, and his experience of returning to China after the revolution for a second time. Then he explained his involvement in Sino-Japanese diplomacy before 1935. Finally, he argued that his establishment of the Jidong Anti-Communist Autonomous Government was to adapt to the special environment of North China at that time, and at least had obtained the "understanding" of Song Zheyuan, the person in charge of the military and political affairs of North China at that time. As for his participation in the puppet government after 1943, he said that it "aimed to respond to the central government's attack." The listeners all smiled. Finally, after the defendant's defense lawyer stood up to defend, the court announced that the defendant would be returned to custody and the trial would be adjourned.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 27th] Chen Tongxiang, the former puppet air force colonel technician and head of the ordnance department of the puppet Guangdong-Suiyuan headquarters, was the nephew of the traitor Chen Fengjun. He was prosecuted by the Capital High Court and the trial concluded. Chen was sentenced to life imprisonment on the afternoon of the 27th, deprived of public office for life, and his property confiscated.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Hangzhou, 27th] A resident surnamed Mou on Laodong Road in Hangzhou had his wife pregnant for a full month. She suddenly had severe abdominal pain a few days ago and asked a midwife to deliver the baby. Unexpectedly, she gave birth to a giant snake when she was about to give birth. Her husband regarded it as an ominous sign and killed the snake that had been born. The woman died soon after due to excessive bleeding.</p>
<h3 id="e21">Ban on "Yiguan Dao" in Nanjing <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 27th] The Eastern Suburb Police Bureau recently discovered a "Yiguan Dao" organization in the Tangshan District, which has been placed under the jurisdiction of the city, and immediately banned it. The address at No. 149 Tangquan Road in the district was originally the site of the Muen Church of Jesus, which was burned down by the enemy during the war. In June 1943, local residents Zhang Jinliang and others initiated the establishment of "Yiguan Dao," with Zhang himself as the leader. The houses were built with funds from the members. After the victory, the government ordered the prohibition of enemy and puppet remnants. So they dare not to public activities. After the Eastern Suburb Police Bureau learned of this, in order to eradicate the evil religion, they went to investigate with the local chief Tang Zhaoming and found a number of "Yiguan Dao" Buddhist books. They ordered Zhang Jinliang to vacate the house, which was temporarily kept by the police bureau, and made a written guarantee to reform himself and no longer set up altars and teach secretly to confuse the masses.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 27th] The water volume of the two rivers in Chongqing has risen sharply simultaneously since the night before. On the Minjiang River, the Coral Dam Airport has been completely submerged. The personnel of the various demobilization units who were originally scheduled to take small steam tugs down the river in batches within a few days have been unable to depart as a result. In order to ensure the safety of navigation along the river, the local Shipping Administration Bureau also notified the various shipping companies this morning that all small steam tugs and wooden boats are not allowed to sail downstream until the river water recedes.</p>
<h3 id="e23">Japanese Female Spies Still Active in Beiping, Police Headquarters Cracks a Case <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>[French News Agency, Beiping, 27th] There are repeated rumors here that a large number of Japanese female spies are still at large in Beiping, carrying out espionage activities. The Beiping Garrison Headquarters arrested a Chinese man named Du Zuobin on the 25th of this month, who lived with the Japanese wife of a certain intelligence official. According to reports, the female spy amassed a large sum of money and property during the Japanese occupation era, and in order to secure her property, she was married to a Chinese man with the help of her husband (also a spy). All the criminals have been sent to the Beiping Headquarters for investigation.</p>
<h3 id="e24">Editorial: Starting with Sino-American Agricultural Cooperation <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>The U.S. delegation of the Sino-American Agricultural Technology Cooperation Team, led by Dr. Claude B. Hutchison, Dean of the College of Agriculture at the University of California, arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon. They will soon delve into rural areas throughout the country for a six-month study and investigation. Then, they will prescribe remedies tailored to the situation, proposing concrete reform plans for improving our country's agricultural policies and technology, as well as increasing and promoting exports of agricultural products, for our government to adopt. At this time when our country's rural areas are on the brink of bankruptcy, we truly hold unlimited expectations for the arrival of the American agricultural delegation and express our utmost welcome.</p>
<p>China is founded on agriculture, with 80% of the national population being farmers, but the mode of production remains in the medieval stage. For decades, it has suffered from repeated natural disasters and man-made calamities, and it is on the verge of bankruptcy. The phrases "Disasters and famines reported in 19 provinces across the country, 30 million people starving" are insufficient to describe the gloomy faces of Chinese farmers today. Only by delving deep into the countryside and witnessing firsthand can one fully understand that the collapse of China's rural economy has indeed reached a critical juncture. Taking just grain as an example, China, known for its vast land and abundant resources, cannot even be self-sufficient. In addition to requesting 400,000 tons of rice and 700,000 tons of wheat from the UN Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, it has also tried to purchase and transport rice and wheat from Brazil, Argentina, Siam, and Vietnam to supplement the people's food supply. Not to mention other necessities. As for the major exports before the war, such as tea, silk, tung oil, pig bristles, fur, and soybeans, production has not only sharply declined recently, but also, due to transportation blockages and high wages, the cost is too high, and domestic prices are far above those abroad, making exports practically impossible. If this situation is allowed to continue, rural bankruptcy will be unavoidable, and there will be no way to discuss the great task of national construction and revitalization. This newspaper's editorials have repeatedly pointed out that industrial construction should start with the construction of agriculture and the stability of rural areas, and that China's industrialization should first industrialize agriculture. The American agricultural delegation's visit to China this time consists of experienced experts who bear the important task of assisting China in building agriculture. This is sufficient to prove that the U.S. government is indeed sincere in assisting China's national construction and revitalization. We, representing the poor and helpless Chinese farmers, not only express our joy, but also deeply wish to do our best to accept the guidance of American experts.</p>
<p>The reasons for the bankruptcy of Chinese rural areas are truly numerous, but the most important is still the destruction caused by man-made disasters. For example, after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the Communist Party, in order to expand its territory, spread throughout the countryside, blockaded cities, destroyed transportation, and launched a civil war, causing unrest and unease in rural areas throughout the country. In the so-called "liberated areas" occupied by the Communist army, not only were those they regarded as landlords subjected to severe torture, but even ordinary, law-abiding, and well-behaved tenant farmers were often unable to survive. Today, south of the Yangtze River, displaced and homeless, many pitiful and helpless refugees from northern Jiangsu Province are a clear example. Therefore, to save the rural areas from bankruptcy, in addition to technological reforms, stabilizing the rural areas requires even more effort. How can rural areas be stabilized? The cessation of conflict, restoration of transportation, and reorganization and unification of the armed forces, as indicated in the government's ceasefire order, must be agreed upon and thoroughly implemented by the end of this month. In other words, only by truly achieving peaceful unification can there be hope. According to a United Press dispatch the day before yesterday, the U.S. military aid bill for China has been passed by the House Foreign Affairs Committee by a vote of 15 to 2. It is no longer a question that this bill will be established and implemented in the future. Special Envoy Marshall has sent a telegram to the State Department, strongly advocating that the United States continue to provide military assistance to China in order to maintain China's unity and stability. This is the most far-sighted measure. We also believe that the passage of this bill by the United States will surely promote the early restoration of stability in Chinese rural areas and accelerate efforts toward production. Because if the Chinese army is not reorganized and reduced in size, there is no way to restore the productivity of rural areas.</p>
<p>From this, it can be seen that the United States, on the one hand, is economically assisting China in improving agriculture to alleviate the suffering of the majority of Chinese people. On the other hand, it is also militarily assisting China in reducing the size of its army to maintain domestic unity and stability, using a two-pronged approach, hoping that China can embark on the road to revitalization in the shortest possible time. The people of our country, in addition to gratitude, can only work harder to build and not be ashamed of the efforts and goodwill of the American ally. However, Mao Zedong publicly issued anti-American remarks in Yan'an, demanding that the United States immediately cease aid to China and withdraw American troops stationed in China as soon as possible. He even slandered "American aid to China as creating civil war in China, plunging China into division, chaos, terror, and poverty." It is truly unknown why he would hallucinate to this extent. Under the orders of Yan'an, Communist parties in various places are vigorously posting anti-American slogans, and in Shanghai, there have been repeated incidents of assaulting U.S. military personnel, plotting to create anti-American incidents similar to the "Boxer Rebellion." The Communist Party's approach is nothing more than to incite anti-American sentiment among ignorant and foolish people, indirectly causing people in the United States who do not understand the political situation in China to rise up and demand that the government no longer interfere in China's affairs. If their trick succeeds, not only will China be harmed, but world peace will also be affected. Amidst the arrival of the American agricultural delegation, we should be highly vigilant against the Communist Party's insidious propaganda.</p>
<p>What the Chinese people have been seeking day and night after the war is national peace, unity, and prosperity. What the American government and people hope for China is also peace, unity, and prosperity. The reason why the American government and people are like this is not only for the common interests of China and the United States, but also because the United States believes that only when a strong, united, and democratic China is established in the Far East can it be hoped that China, the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union can truly cooperate hand in hand in the Far East and lay the foundation for peace. If China cannot be democratic, unified, and strong, China has the possibility of becoming a battlefield for the Third World War. And this is precisely what both the Chinese and Americans do not want to see happen. Therefore, American aid to China and China's willingness to accept American aid are both for the sake of overall world peace. In the United States, it is not aggression, and in China, it is not dependence. In any exchanges between China and the United States, we must, like the agricultural cooperation team, never forget the word "cooperation." Only equality can lead to cooperation, and only cooperation can lead to friendship. The thorough cooperation between China and the United States is purely out of the genuine friendship of both sides, and it is not limited to agricultural technology cooperation alone.</p>

<p>[Special Dispatch from Tianjin] Locust swarms are wreaking havoc in the eastern Tianjin area, and farmland within 70 square miles nearby has suffered from the locust plague, resulting in severe losses. Upon hearing the news last week, the Executive Headquarters Branch immediately allocated 20 large barrels of potent insecticide to the disaster-stricken areas. Mr. Teo, a UNRRA expert, along with technicians from the Peiping Agricultural Experiment Station of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, led many enthusiastic agricultural students to rush to the locust-infested areas to fight the plague. Scientific agents possess great power. After a week of effort, the majority of the locust swarms have been killed. Calculating the number of locusts killed by weight, it reaches over 288 million. In order to coordinate relief and locust eradication, the Executive Headquarters Branch has transported 112,000 pounds of flour to the locust-stricken areas to organize work relief. One pound of flour is issued for every five pounds of locusts or locust eggs captured and killed. The general populace is extremely interested in the locust reduction efforts, it is said.</p>

<p>[News Agency Report] London, 27th Broadcast: Today's meeting of the Four Foreign Ministers continued to discuss the Trieste issue without result and has encountered a new crisis. After Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov put forward what he called a "major concession" proposal, it has been opposed by U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes. The so-called "major concession" proposal includes two points: (1) The Allies should recognize the new Italo-Yugoslav border west of Trieste; (2) The sovereignty of Trieste should belong to both Italy and Yugoslavia, with each side appointing a governor. Byrnes completely opposed this proposal, believing that the issue should be handled by the 21-nation peace conference.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 26th] It has been learned from authoritative sources that the Four Foreign Ministers, at the request of Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky, will hold a special informal meeting at 9:45 PM tonight (6:45 AM Shanghai time on the 27th) to discuss the Italian question, especially the Trieste issue. This agency's diplomatic reporter believes that this special meeting can be regarded as the turning point for the success or failure of the Foreign Ministers' meeting. The Soviet Union's initiation of this discussion indicates that it will put forward a new proposal in order to continue the discussions. However, some observers are unwilling to make any judgments before knowing whether its motive is to genuinely compromise or merely to reiterate its original position. During the Foreign Ministers' meeting this afternoon, the British proposal on the free navigation of the Danube River was temporarily shelved to allow Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov time to study it. British Foreign Secretary Bevin had proposed that all countries could have freedom of commercial navigation on the Danube River and its tributaries.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 26th] The Four Foreign Ministers, at the request of Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, held a secret meeting at the Luxembourg Palace at 9:45 PM this evening. The Four Foreign Ministers have only been discussing minor economic issues for several days. Now the "General Assembly" has begun, and important issues such as the peace treaty with Italy and the Trieste issue will be submitted for discussion. It is generally believed that the Soviet delegation would not request a special meeting without special proposals. The "instructions" from Moscow must have arrived here and are being implemented by the United delegation. However, one thing may dilute the optimistic outlook: the two major barriers that have formed have insisted on not giving way on various fundamental issues until now. It is unknown whether they can be fully broken.</p>

<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 26th] The Czech government has sent a memorandum to the Four Foreign Ministers' meeting, requesting that the port of Trieste be returned to Yugoslavia. It emphasizes that if the port is under international co-governance, it will inevitably cause various inconveniences, will not improve port operations, and will not alleviate ethnic conflicts. It will also be difficult for countries wishing to use the port to transport goods to seek guarantees for free access. Therefore, the Czech government believes that any solution that separates the port from Yugoslavia cannot be reconciled with the interests of the port and Czechoslovakia, and it will also greatly hinder Central European trade and economic development.</p>

According to the Foreign Ministers' meeting, three resolutions have been passed regarding the disposition of Italy's former colonies: (1) The peace treaty with Italy should have a clause stipulating that Italy should renounce its rights to its African colonies; (2) The Four Powers should decide on the legal status of these colonies within one year; (3) If a disposal method cannot be agreed upon within one year, the issue should be submitted to the United Nations for handling.</p>

<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 26th] The entire cabinet of the Bidault government attended the National Constituent Assembly for the first time, and Premier Bidault delivered a speech stating that the government will make every effort to complete the new constitution for the country and hold general elections no later than October of this year to end the provisional government. The first task is to draft a constitution in accordance with the wishes expressed by the people in the general election. The creed it holds is the spirit of the anti-enemy movement during the war, but the anti-enemy movement is only the first chapter of the opening statement, and the entire work remains to be completed. General de Gaulle is the soul of national rejuvenation, and all our countrymen have benefited from it. The government's urgent task at present is to solve the problem of raising wages. A national economic conference will be convened soon, and representatives from all owners, workers, and technicians will participate.</p>

<p>[United Press, Washington, 26th] The report compiled by the U.S. House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee, which visited Europe last autumn, was released today. It firmly advocates that the United States no longer adopt a policy of appeasement towards the Soviet Union.

If the United States is not allowed to conduct political activities in the Soviet Union, then the Soviet Union should not be allowed to conduct political activities in the United States; (5) Expedite a meeting between Chairman Stalin and President Truman to prevent the Soviet Union from doubting the purposes and intentions of the United States; (6) Insist on holding free elections in Poland and adopt some method to maintain the output of the Ruhr region.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 26th Special Dispatch] The United Nations Security Council today agreed to include the Spanish question on the agenda. Today's Security Council meeting listened to the results of the report from the drafting committee composed of Britain, Australia, and Poland. The opinions of Britain and Australia were quite different from those of Poland. The draft resolution proposed by Britain and Australia seeks to ensure that the Security Council's actions do not hinder the UN General Assembly's discussion of the Spanish question in September. The draft resolution proposed by Poland made a strong attack on the Franco regime and explicitly stipulated that September 1 should be the date for the Security Council to raise the Spanish question for discussion again. The Soviet Union immediately expressed its support for the Polish proposal, but as a result, the British and Australian proposal was passed by a vote of 9 to 2. Subsequently, Soviet Representative Gromyko immediately declared that this proposal was a matter of substance rather than procedure, so his vote against it should be regarded as a veto. After a heated debate, the result was that the proposal was finally considered a matter of procedure by a vote of 8 to 2, so the veto power should not be applicable. Afterwards, the proposal was voted on sentence by sentence for the second time, and both sides agreed that the Security Council should continue to pay attention to the Franco regime.</p>

<p>[United Press, Tehran, 26th] According to well-informed diplomatic sources, the conspiracy of the Iranian Communist Party extremists, dissatisfied with Governor Pishevari of Azerbaijan Province (formerly the Prime Minister of the autonomous government), to imprison him has been uncovered. Thirty conspirators have been arrested and imprisoned, but some of the most important figures, who were prominent figures during the era of Azerbaijan's independence, have not been apprehended. The British Consul-General in Tabriz was shot by Communist extremists on the 23rd of this month. These people attempted to storm the prison to release the 30 arrested individuals. The situation in Tabriz is tense.</p>
<h3 id="e36">Protagonist of the Axis Alliance; Matsuoka Yosuke Dies of Illness; Japan's Warmongering Diplomat Ends His Life This Way; Leaves Poem Saying "No Blaming Heaven, No Resenting Others" <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 27th] The International Tribunal announced today that former Japanese Foreign Minister and war criminal Matsuoka Yosuke has died of tuberculosis at the University of Tokyo Hospital at the age of 66. Presiding Judge Webb announced that the name of defendant Matsuoka would be deleted from the indictment and that all charges against him would be dropped. The court approved the request of the defendant's lawyer Warren and ordered that the body be handed over to his family. Matsuoka had been discharged from prison for about a month of convalescence before passing away today. Matsuoka was once active on the international diplomatic stage, signing alliance anti-communist treaties with the Axis powers and concluding a neutrality friendship treaty with the Soviet Union. He was prominent for a time. At the time of his death, only his wife and his 35-year-old eldest son were by his side. According to his son, Matsuoka knew he was about to die and often murmured to himself, "I regret my death." Before entering prison, he wrote a poem for his family, the translation of which is as follows: "No blaming Heaven, no resenting others, I walk down the dark road". Matsuoka first fell ill in July 1941 when he returned from Moscow after signing a neutrality treaty with the Soviet Union. Matsuoka claimed that Japan urgently needed to "launch a genuine revolution to curb the arrogance of the warlords" in 1940. When the warlords were in power, a war with the United States was inevitable. The only way to save the situation was through revolution. The Tripartite Pact between Germany, Italy, and Japan, which he personally negotiated, was also intended to be used to pressure the United States to recognize the difficulty of fighting and thus move towards peace. He had spent a long time in the United States during his life, so he often had pro-American tendencies.</p>
<h3 id="e37">Continued War Criminal Trials - Testimony from Inukai Ken Regarding the Assassination of His Father <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>Testimony Regarding the Assassination of His Father</p>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 27th] The International Military Tribunal for the Far East continued the trial of Japanese war criminals today. Fujita, a former newspaper president, testified that the 27th defendant, Hashimoto Kingoro, had advocated for aggressive action in Manchuria. Fujita recounted that in August 1931, Hashimoto had discussed the situation in Manchuria with Staff Officer Shigeno, and its "endangering of Japanese rights and people." Between the 10th and 15th, Shigeno brought 40,000 yen to Fujita's home to be held for immediate use, and a few days later took away 20,000 yen. After the September 18th Incident, Shigeno said that the Kwantung Army would drive Zhang Xueliang out of the Three Eastern Provinces, and if it failed, he would commit seppuku. Fujita testified yesterday that Hashimoto was a key figure in the March 1931 coup. Hashimoto was the commander of Japanese forces in Nanjing when the U.S. gunboat Panay and the British gunboat Ladybird were shelled. Inukai Ken, son of Inukai Tsuyoshi, then testified that his father opposed Japanese aggression in the Three Eastern Provinces. Several months after the September 18th Incident, he visited the Emperor to request an imperial edict ordering the withdrawal of Japanese troops, but his request was not granted. At the time, his father was Prime Minister and Inukai Ken served as his secretary, as well as being a member of the Diet. His father opposed the recognition of the puppet state of Manchukuo, believing it violated Chinese sovereignty. His father was a close friend of Sun Yat-sen, the father of the Chinese Republic, and they frequented each other in Tokyo. In an effort to resolve the Manchurian problem, he secretly sent a representative to Nanjing to meet with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. Because of his opposition to aggression and reduction of the military budget, he offended the military cliques. The Minister of the Army at the time was Araki Sadao, who is also now listed as a defendant. His father later gave an anti-military clique speech in Yokohama, denouncing fascism, and a week later was assassinated at his official residence by naval officers. However, it is noteworthy that during the cross-examination of the witness, the defendant's lawyers did not mention Inukai Tsuyoshi's visit to the Emperor, indicating that the defendant's lawyers did not want any witness to attribute the Japanese military's wartime actions to the Emperor. Recently, Tojo Hideki declared to a United Press reporter that he was pleased that Chief Prosecutor Keenan had stated that the Emperor should not be prosecuted as a war criminal, expressing the general hope of the Japanese people that the responsibility of the military clique era not be attributed to the Imperial Court.</p>

<p>General Zhu Shimin Makes a Suggestion</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 26th Dispatch] Some members of the Allied Council for Japan suggested to the Allied Headquarters this morning that when the Japanese government disposes of its assets, it should not include machinery that can be used for reparations. My Chief Representative Zhu Shimin suggested that the assets of the South Manchuria Railway Company, the North China Development Company, the Central China Development Company, the Bank of Taiwan, and other organizations that openly carried out economic aggression should be detained until a comprehensive reparations plan is drawn up. The Soviet representative announced this morning that the Soviet government opposes the expansion of Japan's fishing area. The chairman of the Allied Council for Japan, Atcheson, said that he had notified the Japanese government of the Soviet government's instruction on expanding the fishing area and that this matter would be postponed for discussion.</p>

<p>Professor Piccard Plans Scientific Exploration</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Brussels, 26th] Belgian scientists Professor Piccard and Professor Bière, who were famous for studying the upper atmosphere before the war, announced to the press today their new research plan to travel deep into the sea. The two professors hope to descend 12,000 feet into the sea in a sphere six feet in diameter. The sphere will use water separation to prevent leakage. The sphere will be supported by two floats filled with gasoline, each twelve feet long and six feet wide. The windows will be made of transparent resin, allowing a view of everything outside. Lighting will be provided by strong searchlights, and the sphere will be equipped with two propellers for movement. The sphere shell weighs fifteen tons and will be transported by a mother ship to the vicinity of the coast of New Guinea in February of this year to be submerged in the sea for scientific research. Such an enormous object will likely be mistaken for a dragon or sea monster.</p>

<h3 id="e45">The Power of an Atomic Bomb Explosion May Cause Earthquakes; Climate May Also Change – The Speculation of Seismologist Stroff <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>[United Press, San Francisco, 26th] The last batch of ships participating in the atomic bomb test at Bikini Atoll on July 1st sailed from here last week. Seismologist Stroff issued a warning today, saying: "I fear that no one will survive the test to report the test situation. The world's climate may also change as a result, and it will be difficult to recover for decades." The ships that sailed from here last week included the USS Panamint, carrying representatives from the U.S. Congress, various Allied nations, and the scientific community; the USS Blue Ridge, carrying military observers; and the news ship USS Appalacian, carrying reporters from various newspapers, radio stations, and magazines. They will arrive at Bikini one or two days before July 1st. The first atomic bomb is scheduled to be dropped on July 1st, and the second atomic bomb is scheduled to explode in the lagoon of the atoll on July 20th. Stroff's warning stems from this second bomb and was published in an article in "Scientific Community," speculating on the extreme dangers that could be caused during the test.</p>
<p>Earth's Crust Could Be Split</p>
<p>According to Stroff's calculations, the force required to split the Earth's crust into two halves, forty miles deep and three meters wide, would be unimaginable, approximately 29 orders of magnitude in ergs (absolute unit of work). The power generated by an atomic bomb is surprisingly similar to this, only two orders of magnitude less. Stroff's estimates are based on the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima, which was only half the power of the one used in the Bikini test. According to Stroff, the atomic energy generated by nuclear fission at that time would be enough to split the Earth's crust in two, and extreme caution must be exercised when testing larger atomic bombs in the future. Even the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima, if exploded on the ocean surface or in the ocean, or if the seismic resistance of Bikini Atoll had been below normal in the previous months, could cause danger, leading to no one surviving to report the test. If the seabed is fractured by the atomic bomb during the test and the cracks are deep enough, the temperature within will inevitably be extremely high, and seawater will flow into the cracks. The steam generated will deepen and widen the cracks, and the resulting steam expansion may cause a tsunami that destroys all ships, both those intended as bombing targets and those not.</p>
<p>Underwater Explosion Causes Danger</p>
<p>Furthermore, if the atomic bomb used in the test is larger than the one dropped on Hiroshima, the range and height of the steam and dust ejected from the seabed may be several times greater than that caused by the eruption of Krakatoa in 1883. If the amount of dust is indeed several times greater than that ejected during the Krakatoa eruption, the world's climate may be affected, causing adverse changes that last for decades. When Krakatoa erupted, it ejected an estimated ten to twenty cubic miles of rubble, and sunlight was cooled by the rubble for several years. Shawyer, the technical scientific director participating in the Bikini test, also made an estimate of the energy generated during the atomic bomb explosion, but Stroff did not mention it in his paper. Shawyer and his colleagues calculated the amount of energy released in the water when an atomic bomb explodes underwater, estimating that it would be about 10% to 50% of the total energy released. The energy that the atomic bomb can cause in underwater earthquakes or volcanic eruptions is limited to this amount. Based on Shawyer's numbers, Stroff's statement that the earth's crust will crack during the test would require two to ten times more atomic energy than he himself calculated. According to Stroff's figures, the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima was actually greater than the San Francisco earthquake.</p>
<p>Flipping a Switch Could Cause an Earthquake</p>
<p>However, according to calculations by atomic energy scientists, the explosive force of an atomic bomb is only one-thousandth to one-ten-thousandth of the seismic force of the San Francisco earthquake. However, the real danger that atomic bomb explosions can cause can be glimpsed from this. Even if the atomic bomb explosion itself is not enough to cause an earthquake, it can still cause a place where an earthquake is likely to occur to erupt, like flipping a switch on a gun. For example, if the rock beneath the spot where the atomic bomb falls is already in a state of detachment, it will inevitably fracture after this shock. This fracturing may be expanded by the influence of natural forces into an earthquake. The reason why Stroff is afraid that if the seismic resistance of Bikini Atoll is low in the months before the experiment, this atomic bomb explosion is very likely to cause an earthquake lies in this, although this "earthquake switch" theory is also highly questionable. Typhoons and giant sea winds sometimes cause earthquakes, which is a fact. These storms can cause strong vibrations on the seabed. Father MacLen of St. Louis has recorded on his seismograph the power of vibrations caused by storms. The energy generated by these vibrations may be even greater than that of an atomic bomb, but it still does not seem sufficient to trigger an earthquake. The first atomic bomb test in Mexico cratered the earth's crust by six feet, with a diameter of about half a mile, which was virtually the same as triggering an earthquake. However, the vibration at the time was still light, and the range was not very wide, and it did not become an "earthquake switch" and trigger a real earthquake.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Washington, 26th] The U.S. Navy Department announced tonight that it has now been decided to drop the atomic bomb at Bikini Atoll at 22:30 Greenwich Mean Time next Sunday (7:30 AM Shanghai time on Monday). This was chosen by meteorologists, who expect the weather to be excellent at that time.</p>

<h3 id="e47">Severe Punishment Decided for Unscrupulous Merchants Hoarding Rice <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>Since the city adopted measures for rationing rice, rice prices have gradually stabilized. However, recently some rice merchants have again implemented a "scorched earth" tactic, hoarding rice and refusing to sell it, and black market trading has occurred. The Food Department and the City Government have now agreed on measures to increase the source of rice in the rice market as much as possible, and hope that citizens will expose and report the tricks of unscrupulous merchants hoarding rice. The authorities will severely punish such unscrupulous merchants.</p>
<p>[Another Report] The amount of grain arriving in the city today was relatively small, and some rice stores had no rice to sell. The municipal authorities are paying close attention. It is understood that the municipal grain authorities distributed 2,270 shih of stored grain to 227 rice stores in the city yesterday, 10 shih per store, to supply the market. It is also understood that 1,079 shih, 8 dou, and 6 sheng were actually sold yesterday, and in principle, there should be no phenomenon of no rice for sale. It is heard that the Municipal Government's Commercial Bureau has taken various swift and effective measures to stop this.</p>

<p>[Report from this newspaper] The Shanghai No. 6 Printing and Dyeing Factory of the China Textile Construction Company, formerly the Yida Dyeing Factory during the enemy and puppet period, was recently applied for reversion by Wang Xifan, the former chairman of Yida, to the Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau, and was approved. The handover was scheduled for the day before yesterday, supervised by Cheng Shouzhong, a commissioner of the Handling Bureau, together with Dai Lizhen, Cheng Yanghe of the Textile Industry Management Committee, and Chen Xianfan, a special commissioner of China Textiles. When Wang Xifan was discussing the handover procedures, representatives of the factory's employees requested to attend the meeting as observers. After taking their seats, the employee representatives spoke one after another, arguing that since Wang was the chairman of Yida, and Yida cooperated with the Japanese Gonda Textile Factory during the enemy and puppet period, and the manager of Yida was also appointed by Gonda, first Rokusho Naotaka and then Inoue Mitsujiro, then Wang Xifan was suspected of colluding with the enemy and fraudulently applying for reversion. It seemed inappropriate to grant reversion immediately. They also indicated that the employees had filed a report with the court. After hearing this, Commissioner Chen and others believed that the facts were still awaiting investigation and immediately suspended the reversion. It is heard that the court's prosecutor's office sent personnel to the factory yesterday and summoned Wang Xifan to investigate the organization of Yida at that time.</p>

<p>[Our Dispatch] Yang Guangzheng (originally named Jin Hao, also known as Shouqing, Qingtao), a native of Fengxian, Jiangsu, 37 years old, was an editor at Beixin Bookstore before the war. Later, he taught at Hongyi Middle School. After 1943, he served as the editor of the "Shen Bao" yearbook and also as a director of the puppet Sino-Japanese Cultural Association, engaging in the work of communicating enemy cultural ideas. After the victory, he was arrested. The High Procuratorate prosecuted him on suspicion of being a traitor. He was tried in court yesterday morning. Yang Guangzheng, wearing a gray long gown, entered the courtroom with a smile. According to his statement, the so-called "China-Japan Cultural Association" director position was brought to him by Zhou Huarin. He had no work and no remuneration. Although the chairman of the branch was the traitor Chen Gongbo, the actual person in charge was Zhou Huarin. At that time, Liu Haisu and others were also pulled in as members, so it can be seen that it was really unavoidable. Subsequently, the witness Chen Gaoyong testified that Yang Guangzheng's concept of the nation has not changed from beginning to end. In 1944, when Chen served as the director of the Shanghai Cultural Movement Committee of the Kuomintang, he summoned Yang as an intelligence officer, providing a lot of enemy and puppet cultural information. Further testimony by witnesses Xie An and Wang Ruoqi, that Yang was the editor of the "Shen Bao" yearbook, but the actual person in charge was Chen Bin. Later, lawyer Xu Zhisong provided evidence of five letters proving Yang's contact with underground workers, and presented the 1936 Kaiming "Literary Yearbook" and four issues of the Zhengyan Literary Monthly, and requested that the Education Ministry's Shanghai Commissioner Chen Baohua and the Chief of the First Propaganda Team of the Third War Zone and Commissioner Xue Yichong be summoned as witnesses. The court ordered the hearing to be rescheduled.</p>

<p>About to Depart for On-site Investigations in Various Locations</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The American delegation of the Executive Yuan Sino-American Agricultural Technical Cooperation Group, a group of eight people, including Dr. H. H. Hutcheson, the head of the delegation, Muir, the deputy head and secretary, and members Case, Buck, Huber, Burns, Sietch, and Grand, arrived at Jiangwan Airport in this city at around 6:00 AM yesterday. In addition, delegation members Nashby and Hemmer had already arrived in China in February of this year. At 6:30 PM yesterday afternoon, the American delegation and the Chinese delegation, including Shen Zonghan, hosted a reception for the city's press at the Tsinghua Alumni Association in the Citibank Building. At the reception, Dr. H. H. Hutcheson, the head of the American delegation, gave a speech. Mr. Hutcheson first elaborated on the purpose of this trip for the American representatives. In terms of purpose, it can be divided into three points:</p>
<p>(1) Advise the Chinese government on agricultural plans and the organization for implementing these plans, (2) Make recommendations on the parts of the plan suitable for cooperation between the two governments, and stipulate the policies, personnel, tools, and organization required to implement this plan, and (3) Advise on immediate action to be taken on urgent issues. Next, he described the procedure for carrying out the work. Mr. Hutcheson said that the work of the group will be planned in cooperation by representatives from both China and the United States. Therefore, the members of the two countries will work in close contact and conduct on-site investigations. Finally, they will jointly study how to proceed in order to achieve the objectives of the plan. He said that the members of the Sino-American delegation are mostly experts with both knowledge and experience, and he sincerely hopes that each will do their best to make a contribution. Therefore, all the conclusions and plans of the group are based on the cooperation of the delegation members of the two countries. It is said that the American delegation will stay in Shanghai for ten days and then go to Beijing. In both Beijing and Shanghai, they will have many talks and discussions with all relevant parties, so that the American delegation can better understand the situation in our country. After this preparation, they will be divided into small groups to conduct on-site investigations in various places to understand the true situation. The estimated investigation time is about two months. After the investigation is completed, they will gather all the figures and data, formulate practical improvement plans, and suggest steps for implementing the plans to contribute to the government for adoption. The group will pay special attention to the improvement of China's four major agricultural products for export trade, such as tung oil, tea, silk, and wool, in order to increase production, improve varieties, promote China's export trade, and enrich China's foreign exchange resources. In addition to studying and handling urgent issues, the most important task of the country will focus on permanent agricultural improvements and cooperation plans.

<h3 id="e63">Speculation Fails, Wild Ideas Emerge, Tong Chengde, Owner of Feida Securities Firm, Conspired with Courtesan to Issue Bad Checks, Defrauding 120 Million <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Tong Chengde, a native of Ningbo, opened the Feida Securities Firm at No. 527 Cishu Building, Nanjing Road. Recently, due to speculation failure, he conspired with courtesan Chen Lanqing and her brother Zongwang to issue four bad checks, defrauding Yimao Enterprise Company of 19,500 shares of Yong'an Yarn Factory stock, worth more than 120 million legal tender. Afterwards, the victim, Chu Deshou, reported the case to the Huangpu Police Bureau. The branch director, Du Zui, ordered the section chief of the Second Section, Zhou, section members Cao Yiwen, police chief Zhao Hairu, Chen Zhifan and others to investigate.</p>
<p>It was quickly learned that the issuer of the checks was Chen Lanqing's brother, Zongwang, with a face value of 30 million per check, totaling 120 million. It was also found at the Xinhua Bank that Chen Zongwang's account had only 4,000 yuan in savings. Therefore, they went to No. 24 Central Road and arrested Chen Zongwang and his sister Lanqing together. Chen confessed that it was his sister who instructed him. Chen Lanqing confessed that the four checks were all given to Tong Chengde, the owner of Feida Securities Firm. After purchasing Yong'an Yarn Factory stocks, they were sold again, earning more than 30,000 U.S. dollars and more than one million (face value) in government bonds. However, when asked where these gold bills and government bonds were, she falsely claimed that they were all lost on a rickshaw. When Tong Chengde was arrested, Tong was nowhere to be found. Later, Tong was arrested at the Gongli Hospital on Fuxing Road. When interrogated, Tong also denied the allegations and denied intentional fraud, claiming that the U.S. dollar notes and government bonds were lost by Chen Lanqing. Later, after discussion among the investigating police officers, Cao instructed police officer Ju Xingmei and others on the matter, and on the afternoon of the 24th, police officers disguised themselves as lawbreakers and locked them up in the same detention center as Tong, intending to uncover the truth. Sure enough, at around 2:00 AM on the morning of the 25th, the prisoner Tong asked the police officer on duty outside to pour tea, and then took the opportunity to call Chen Lanqing, who was imprisoned in the adjacent room, and said that the U.S. dollar notes and government bonds at home must not be acknowledged, otherwise he would be guilty, and so on. At that time, the disguised police officers recorded Tong's conversation and brought them out again for interrogation. Chen and Tong were speechless and finally confessed the truth, saying that they had resorted to this last resort due to speculation failure, and also confessed the location of the stolen goods. The original group of police officers then went to Tong's residence at No. 28 Jing'an Villa and seized 21,650 U.S. dollar notes and 1.23 million in government bonds. At this point, the whole case was revealed, and they were transferred to the local prosecutor's office for investigation yesterday morning.</p>
<h3 id="e64">Speculation Fails, Messy Cleanup, Another Bad Check Case <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The Dagong Securities Firm at No. 535 Securities Building was established by manager Shi Yingzhou, associate manager Zhu Yucang, and accountant Xie Zhonghe. A few days ago, they used 30 shares of Xinnuo Yarn Factory stock, 100 shares of Jardine Matheson Yarn Factory stock, and two gold bars to borrow 10 million yuan from Fu Bingkui for use. However, in mid-June, Shi and others issued a check from Qingcheng Qianzhuang to redeem the items from the Fu family. However, on June 21, the securities firm suddenly closed down, causing the Qingcheng Zhuang check to bounce due to insufficient funds. Afterwards, Fu reported the case to the Lao Zha Police Bureau for prosecution. Shi, the director of the Shi branch, ordered the section chief Jiang to send officers to arrest and interrogate the defendants Shi Yingzhou and others. It was learned that they also suffered a huge loss of 30 million due to speculation failure, and a strict investigation is currently underway.</p>

<p>[United Press dispatch from this city] Many American veterans and civilians in Shanghai have pooled their resources to do business in China. Seeing that Jeeps are cheap, freight is low, and sales are good, they have ordered Jeeps from the U.S. Foreign Liquidation Commission to be shipped to Shanghai for wholesale. The Liquidation Commission has already approved the orders and will deliver the goods to Shanghai within two weeks, but they did not inform them in advance that the Chinese government has stipulated that ordinary people are not allowed to purchase Jeeps. They said today that they have been "swindled by the Liquidation Commission."</p>

<h3 id="e68">Chen Yuansheng, the Main Culprit in the Gold Bar Case, Directly Admits His Crimes, Misled by Speculation, Mistake After Mistake <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Chen Yuansheng, the main culprit in the Central Bank embezzlement case, was previously apprehended in Shangyu County. After being escorted to the Huangpu Branch of the Shanghai Municipal Police Department, he was escorted by the bureau to the local court prosecutor's office on Xuehuali Road at 11:00 AM yesterday. The court opened the investigation at about 5:00 PM in the afternoon, and after a brief interrogation, he was taken to the detention center of the local court. Yesterday, Chen wore a dark gray silk short shirt and pants, black cloth shoes, and his attitude was calm and his speech was slow. He admitted to all the crimes he committed, but claimed that he was misled by speculation, mistake after mistake, and that the embezzlement of public funds was too large, so he had no choice but to resort to this last resort. Prosecutor Gu Hongbiao previously believed that Chen's speculative activities and wasteful spending, and the fact that he had stolen gold bars and bonds under his custody as part of his duties, and his status as a public official in a national bank, constituted a violation of Article 3, Paragraph 2 of the Regulations on Punishment of Corruption. After this investigation, if new evidence is discovered, a public prosecution will be filed separately.</p>

<p>Director of Cigarette Factory Secretly Reports to Police Bureau, Fuchunlou Restaurant Catches Four Criminals in Disguise</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Zhu Yongnian, a Changchun native residing at No. 35 Heqing Lane, Xindagulu Road, is the sales director of the Yue Dong Cigarette Factory in this city. At 2:00 PM on the 17th of this month, a man in military uniform, accompanied by a plainclothes man, went to his residence, claiming to be from the Fenglai Road Gendarmerie Corps, accusing Zhu of being a traitor and attempting to extort money. However, Zhu was not at home at the time, and his second landlord, Fan Fengqi, came out to deal with the two men. Then, the man in military uniform instructed the second landlord not to move any of the furniture in Zhu's room, and then left. Later, when Zhu returned home and learned of the incident, he immediately recalled that an acquaintance, Su Xingan, had advised him that someone was planning to report him as a traitor, so he went to Su to inquire about the truth. Su Xingan then colluded with Cui Chuntang, Wang Jian, Zeng Xiangchu and others to repeatedly invite Zhu Yongnian to public places such as the Royal Cafe, Dasyuan Tea Room, and Mei Hua Restaurant for negotiations, falsely claiming that if he wanted to settle the case, he would have to pay 20 gold bars. Zhu could not afford this huge sum, and after repeated negotiations, it was finally reduced to eight gold bars, scheduled to be delivered at the Huake Road Fuchunlou Restaurant on the morning of the 24th of this month. Zhu then suspected that Su and others were impersonating soldiers to extort money and secretly reported it to the Taishan Branch. Director Luo Song Tingjun supervised the section chief Zhang Rou, section members Zhang Jiashi, Jin Zhongxiong, Ha Jiagang, and police officers Shao Guanrong, Huang Yangquan, Li Xinheng, and Jin Yuancai to dress up as customers and wait at Fuchunlou. When Su Xingan and others arrived, Zhu handed over a check for 12 million yuan and 500,000 yuan in cash to the other party. At this time, the officers immediately arrested Su Xingan, Zeng Xiangchu, Wang Jian, and Cui Chuntang and brought them back to the bureau for interrogation. As the case was related to impersonating soldiers for extortion, the interrogation is currently underway, and they will be transferred to the local prosecutor's office for handling.</p>

Later, he reached an agreement with the Japanese army to release all the Italians in the camp, on the condition that the defendant would lead hundreds of sailors and Italian marines on the Italian ship Conte Verde to assist the Japanese army in military production at the Jiangnan Shipyard. The defendant then left Shanghai in January 1945 and went to Beidaihe. After the victory, he was arrested by the Northeast Commander-in-Chief's Office in Pingjin and transferred by the Military Affairs Commission's Northeast Headquarters to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters for transfer to the military court.</p>

<p>Insistent on Demanding Tax Reduction, City Government Considers it Unreasonable</p>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The Theatrical Guild of this city, represented by Zhou Jianyun and four other delegates, presented three demands to the City Government the day before yesterday: (1) Extend business hours; (2) Abolish ticket price limits; (3) Reduce entertainment tax. These demands were resolved by the guild meeting. If no satisfactory response is received, all ninety-plus theaters in Shanghai will suspend operations starting July 1st. To this end, our reporter made a special visit to the Municipal Finance Bureau. According to Director Chen of the Third Division of the bureau: The Finance Bureau and the Social Affairs Bureau exchanged opinions yesterday morning. The result was that the city government may accept the first two items, but the tax reduction issue is likely to be difficult to achieve, as the entertainment tax is currently a major source of revenue for the city treasury. It was unanimously believed that there was some contradiction in their demands. Since they want to increase ticket prices, they can certainly increase revenue, so there is no need to reduce taxes. This matter has been submitted to Mayor Wu for a decision, and the handling measures will be put forward for discussion at today's municipal meeting.</p>
<p>[Another Report] According to the latest information obtained by our reporter: The Theatrical Guild of this city has decided to suspend operations uniformly starting July 1st. This is because when the guild held a general membership meeting yesterday afternoon, it learned that the authorities might accept the first two items, but the tax reduction was difficult to implement. Therefore, the guild made this firm statement and decided to hold another meeting tomorrow to discuss the livelihood issues of the members during the suspension period. The guild includes ten groups such as Peking Opera, spoken drama, Cantonese opera, and Shanghai opera, with a total of more than ninety theaters. Whether the spoken drama circle will participate in this suspension remains to be decided after today's meeting. The film industry is excluded.</p>

<p>[Report from our newspaper in this city] Most of the students of Datong University are willing to abide by the school rules and take the exam. On the 19th of this month, Mayor Wu went to the school to give instructions to all the students, and they had no objection. On the 20th, Mayor Wu went to the school again and saw some students who were not from the school and a few students from the school moving desks and chairs out of the classroom, which obviously obstructed the examination. Afterwards, the students who were willing to take the exam sent representatives to report to Mayor Wu. They said that someone threatened and wanted to beat the students who were taking the exam, and requested that the police be sent to protect them properly. The school authorities also made the same request. After learning about the situation, Mayor Wu ordered the Municipal Police Bureau to send police to the front of the school gate to maintain order, and there were no military or police monitoring the examination. As for the issue of checking students within the school, it was handled by the Datong University authorities themselves. Currently, more than 80% of the students at the school have taken the exam. The previous request to postpone the exam was obviously the private intention of a few people, and there were other purposes.</p>

<p>Subject List: Items That Should Be Corrected</p>
<p>[Another Report] The Overseas Students Examination Committee of the Ministry of Education recently issued two announcements as follows: (1) The regulations for the self-funded overseas students examination of the Ministry of Education in 1946 have been announced on May 7th of this year. It is now found that the footnote to the regulations states: "There are also a small number of departments in vocational schools that are not included in this table. If students in departments not listed in this table apply after registration, the examination subjects will be added." Due to the current transportation difficulties, the submission of registration information from various regions and the drafting of new subjects and questions cannot be completed on time. Therefore, no more departments will be added. Students in departments not listed in this table should apply for examinations in subjects similar to their departments. This is hereby announced. (2) The items that should be corrected in the subject list for the publicly funded overseas students examination in 1946 are announced as follows: (1) The specialized subject for the "French Literature" department, "French Literature," should be changed to "French," "English Literature" should be changed to "English," and "German Literature" should be changed to "German." (2) The "English Literature" department should be added after the "French Literature" department, and its qualifications and specialized subjects should be the same as "French Literature."

<p>Matters Needing Attention When Applying for the Exam</p>
<p>[Report from our newspaper in this city] In this year's publicly funded and self-funded overseas students examination, more than 1,400 people have requested application forms from the Shanghai area, and more than 600 people have submitted documents to apply. Students often encounter obstacles due to insufficient academic documents. The following are the most important matters needing attention that have been recently learned: (1) Diplomas from national and registered private universities or colleges that have been verified and stamped by the Ministry of Education are not a problem and can be used to apply. (2) Graduates from national and registered universities or colleges who have obtained a certificate of graduation can be temporarily allowed to apply, but they must submit a diploma verified and stamped by the Ministry of Education before passing the exam and going abroad.

<p>The Hong Kong Star East Football Team was invited by the Small Football Committee yesterday to perform a small football game at Yiyuan. The program started at 4:30 pm and consisted of two games. First, Qingbai easily defeated the Soviet Union by seven to two. In the final game, the Star East Expeditionary Force played against Western Union. Mr. Xi Yushu performed the opening ceremony. As a result, Star East lost to Western Union by three to five.</p>
<p>First Game Qingbai Beats Soviet Union</p>
<p>At 4:30, referee Jiang Yinseng blew the whistle to start the game. Qingbai immediately launched an attack. The Soviet Union joined forces to block, but it was still difficult to resist. In two minutes, Luo Shoufu got a pass from Xu Mingde and swept near the goal, scoring immediately. Qingbai took the lead 1-0. Five minutes later, Gronas crossed Chunhua and went straight to the goal, scoring a goal, and the score was tied 1-1. Soon after, Qingbai Gu Yiche rode alone and returned with success, Qingbai took the lead again 2-1. The Soviet Union tried hard to counterattack, but Qingbai's defense was tight and it could not succeed. In the 17th minute, Luo Shoufu passed from the left corner, and Xiao Gu sneaked into the net, Qingbai's morale was greatly boosted 3-1. Three minutes before the end of the first half, Luo Shoufu added the icing on the cake and scored another goal, ending the first half 4-1.</p>
<p>After the break, the lineups of both armies changed slightly.

<p>Final Battle Western Union Wins Star East</p>
<p>In the final battle, Xi Yushu performed the opening ceremony. When the two armies came into contact, the expeditionary army was not used to running on the grass, and they often fell. In addition, they were tired from continuous competitions, and the performance was out of tune. Looking back at the Western Union, they were extremely rampant. In three minutes, Robert Stoff crossed three passes and hit the bullseye, Western Union took the lead 1-0. In ten minutes, Shuo You got a pass from Kun Sheng and broke through the pass to enter, making the score 1-1. In two minutes, Da Chong and Xiao Huangmao rode in pairs, Huangmao was offside and was not discovered, and scored another goal, Western Union took the lead again 2-1, and the first half ended in a mixed battle.</p>
<p>After the lemon, both sides adjusted their formations and fought again. Xiao Huangmao rammed straight, Zhang Jinhai could not stop him, and Robert Stoff made a great contribution, making the score 3-1. Xiao Huangmao Liu again, Xu Jingcheng saved with a pounce, and Colonis rushed up and put it into the net, making the score 4-1. The guest army was stimulated by this, and the morale of the army suddenly dropped. The forwards immediately became active, and Li Shuoyou scored two goals in a row. The expeditionary force seemed to have a turnaround 4-3. But the enemy was not willing to give in, and took strict precautions, opening a mixed battle scene. In the 19th minute, Guo Yingqi took a short break, Jin Hai filled the center, and Hou Rongsheng entered the game again. The Western Union took the opportunity to enter and Colonis took a base, making the score 5-3. As the expeditionary force was about to counterattack, the referee's silver whistle sounded, announcing the end, only twenty minutes, which caused some spectators to criticize and a small disturbance occurred. Fortunately, the players and military police worked hard to maintain order and nothing happened.</p>

<h3 id="e103">Market Idle Funds Fuel Buying Spree, Gold Price Breaks Two Million Mark, Hong Kong Dollar Still in High Demand <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, buyers continued to act on the psychology of valuing gold over cash. Speculators' surplus capital created demand exceeding supply. Starting from a strong 1.96 million in the morning, the price gradually increased. The central government's allocation of 306 bars further drove the price to 1.9775 million. After 10 AM, the situation strengthened, and by noon, it approached the 2 million mark. In the afternoon, the buying spree intensified, breaking through the 2 million mark and reaching a high price of 2.03 million. Afterward, it turned into a moderate fluctuation. As a result, the closing price was a sharp increase of 52,000 compared to the previous day. Gold jewelry was listed as high as 214,000, silver at 2,200, and the unofficial money market was stable, with interest rates at 1.3 to 1.6.</p>
<p>Foreign currency, especially US dollars, remained unpopular, far less so than gold. Although there were a few buyers from the gold sector, the increase was limited. The morning opened with buying at 2660 yuan and selling at 2680 yuan. This price held for a long time. At noon, it was passively raised to 2690 yuan. In the afternoon, it was still pulled up by the gold market to 2730 yuan before slightly stabilizing. As a result, the closing price was up 50 yuan compared to the previous day, with the spread widening to 745 yuan per ten taels. The Hong Kong dollar remained in high demand, rising another 10 yuan, with the Hong Kong exchange rate at 550 yuan, the Indian exchange rate at 670 yuan, and the British exchange rate at 8700 yuan for selling, with low trading volumes. The US exchange rate remained largely unchanged.</p>
<p>Following the successful major loan from the UK to the US, the UK's domestic and sterling bloc finances have become more stable. In the sterling bloc, the British authorities are currently maintaining a standard exchange rate of 4.02 (the value of each pound sterling in US dollars). Sino-British trade has not yet begun, so there are no formal regulations or strict controls on exchange rates. Recently, British merchants have been eager to restore and develop their Far East business. Additionally, requests for US dollars to purchase non-essential goods are not being approved. Trading houses dealing in non-essential goods are turning to buy pounds sterling and transferring them to US dollars, causing the value of the pound sterling to rise to nearly 8450 yuan due to competition among Chinese and foreign merchants. Other currencies, such as rupees and Hong Kong dollars, have also risen.</p>
<h3 id="e104">Truth About Settling European Exchange Rates: Purchase of British Goods Should Be Settled in Pounds Sterling, No So-Called Black Market Exchange Rate <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>[By Our Reporter] Recently, import and export traders in this city have heard that designated foreign exchange banks have been ordered not to settle payments for goods imported from European countries in US dollars. The reporter inquired about this matter with relevant parties at the Central Bank. It was stated that it was never reasonable to order and import goods from the UK with US dollars, so it was stipulated long ago that purchases of goods from the UK should be settled in pounds sterling. The same is true for other European countries, so there has been no recent change. It was also stated that the Central Bank is currently only issuing telegraphic transfer rates for US dollars. For exchange rates of other countries, designated foreign exchange banks may offer rates based on their own circumstances. These rates fluctuate slightly based purely on supply and demand, and there is no so-called black market exchange rate.</p>

<p>Over-the-counter trading of public bonds was minimal. Some parties were forced to sell due to tight money conditions. A certain member of the Fifth Floor Northern Gang slightly replenished their holdings, but the increase was limited. The price difference for Type C bonds was only 70 yuan. The situation was stagnant. As a result, due to the inability of Type C bonds to rally, miscellaneous bonds also slightly declined.</p>

<p>Chinese stocks turned slightly stronger yesterday. The market situation was quite stable, and outside idle funds took advantage of the low prices to accumulate holdings. The number of floating shares was slightly reduced. Prices of various stocks gradually trended higher after opening, but less popular stocks showed a divergent trend. Popular stocks opened lower and closed higher, with narrow intraday fluctuations. As a result, popular stocks such as Yongsha slightly rebounded compared to the previous closing price. Among smaller and less popular stocks, Xinyi slightly rose, Zhongfang was flat, and the rest slightly declined. Old stocks made no progress.</p>
<p>Major players gathered funds to buy foreign stocks. Large stocks targeted British Union and Jardine Matheson, while smaller stocks favored Jardine Matheson products. Due to seasonal factors, the demand was extremely high, resulting in substantial profits. After opening, Yishasha rose from 9200 yuan and British Union from 8300 yuan, gradually improving. Other stocks were also brought up accordingly, closing at high prices. As a result, compared to the previous closing price, British Union alone rose by 15%, Yisha, Yibian, Steel and Paper each rose by 10%, and Jardine Matheson, due to its large price, only rose by 5%. Although Yeguang and Asia rose, the increase was not significant.</p>

Over a hundred baskets of Zhongzhuang Xinghua white sugar were at 122,000 yuan, raw sugar was marked at 105,000 yuan, and three and a half cars of white sugar were marked at 185,000 yuan.

<p>[By Our Reporter] Recently, bamboo rafts have been arriving in large quantities at Zhoujiaqiao on the Suzhou River and Longhua South Huangpu, one after another. As bamboo is one of the building materials, its previously short supply and high price have now been reversed due to the continuous flow of goods. However, according to people in the industry, bamboo prices at the production areas have risen, because the busy farming season has arrived, and new bamboo is just growing and cannot be felled. Moreover, labor costs are unusually high. Future arrivals are unlikely to be strong.</p>

<p>Coal market transactions are slightly more active, and the market situation shows a slight turnaround. Due to the inverted relationship between the cost of white coal and the market price, the arrival of Yangquan coal was affected. The stocks of those outside the industry are being sold off, so the market price has stopped falling and rebounded. The supply of bituminous coal from various sources still falls short of demand, so the Fuel Management Committee's allocation of coal for private production enterprises remains strict. Moreover, the inventory of high-grade goods on the market is thin, and the market situation is also firm.</p>

<p>The first batch of new orchid bamboo branches arrived yesterday on the Yanxun ship, along with a second batch of five to six hundred pieces of black leaf and early red branches. As the orchid bamboo is the first of its kind, its newness ensures a high price. However, as the number of early red black leaf branches is larger, the price is bound to fall.</p>
<h3 id="e112">Yarn Market Still Short on Spot Goods, Cotton Cloth Market Stable <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market remained stable. The Southern Gang still had an appetite for large yarns, so Shuangma was able to stand firm between 1.55 and 1.56 million. Demand for small and medium-sized yarns exceeded supply, and spot goods were scarce, so prices were also firm, continuing to rise by around 10,000. The price of 42-count double-strand thread was weak and slow-moving, deviating from the trend of 20-count yarn.</p>
<p>Due to the lack of spot goods, China Textile had not supplied it for several periods, and customers had some demand, so the market situation was firm, rising by 500 yuan. Although the base cloth was good, its sales were not widespread. There was not much change in the market for other cloths. The price of cloth opened by China Textile was average. In the afternoon, the price of serge went up another step.</p>

<p>[By Our Reporter] Banks and money shops that had not been registered with the ministry before June 26 of the Republic of China either continued to operate during the War of Resistance or were forced to stop. On February 5 of this year, the Ministry of Finance promulgated measures for the re-establishment of commercial banks in the recovered areas, and subsequently promulgated supplementary measures, unified and limited to three months, to submit documents for approval in order to continue operating or resume operations in their original locations. It is understood that the Ministry of Finance, due to inconvenient transportation and the late arrival of this order in various places, has stipulated that it will be uniformly extended to July 15, with no further extensions.</p>

<p>The factory insists on proportional distribution; the Cotton Cloth Industry Association holds a meeting to discuss</p>
<p>[Our City News] Holders of cotton cloth warehouse receipts issued by the British Lun Chang factory before the outbreak of the Pacific War were unable to pick up their goods and were all seized by the enemy. After the victory, this seized cotton cloth, not taken away by the enemy, was discovered by the holders, who reported it to the Cotton Cloth Industry Association for negotiations to retrieve it. After receiving the report, the association submitted it to the Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau for approval. Now that the goods have been issued to the Lun Chang factory for collection first, the Lun Chang factory, after collecting the goods, insisted that customers and the factory should proportionally distribute the goods. All receipt holders believed that the factory had not fulfilled its responsibilities under the warehouse receipts. The customers discovered all seized goods and it was unfair for the company to suddenly insist on a proportional distribution. In order to find a solution, the association decided to convene a meeting of all warehouse receipt holders at the association at 4 pm today to seek their opinions for negotiations.</p>

<p>Due to Continuous Rise in US Cotton</p>
<p>Yesterday, the New York US cotton telegram soared again by fifty to fifty-three pounds. The near-term US dollar was 30.49, the far-term was 30.67, and the Meterlin spot price was 31.15. Spot cotton trading in this city was more active. Tongyi, Rende, Shenxin First Factory, and small inland spinning factories all made purchases. Due to the soaring US cotton, the market price rose by a huge 34,000 yuan compared to the previous day.</p>

<p>Zhenmei green tea, new goods from Wenzhou, have been on the market since the sale opened a few days ago. There are many sellers in the market, but the buyers also intend to take them. Therefore, they are still in negotiations. If they can get close, there is hope for another transaction. As for domestic sales, Wuxi, Yixing, and other places have a particularly urgent demand for Taiwan bud tea and black tea. Those holding the goods are taking the opportunity to pull up the price, so the market is advancing. For other teas, the appetite of the stores on this street is still sufficient, so although the selling atmosphere is firm, those inquiring are all waiting and watching. Therefore, transactions are weak, and the trend is as stable as before.</p>

<p>Recently learned: In Tunxi and the surrounding areas, heavy rain poured down last week, and mountain torrents broke out in Huigang, causing wood rafts parked along the banks of the Xin'an River to be washed away, resulting in heavy losses. It is reported that the amount of timber washed away from Tun to Hangzhou reached more than 20,000 loads. According to experienced timber traders, after this major loss of Huizhou timber, and given that it is currently the busy farming season, it will be difficult for spot goods to arrive in Hangzhou within a few months. In addition, the river water will dry up after autumn, making transportation difficult.</p>

<p>After the victory, steel rebar has been widely used. However, there have been few imports of foreign goods, resulting in a depletion of inventory.

<p>Kanshi White Rice Shop in the rice market adopts a rationing system for retail rice sales. Transactions with other businesses have virtually stopped. Yesterday, registered sales of white Japonica were 90 stone, polished Indica were 1677 stone, and rice shops transported and sold 697 stone and 294 bags themselves, totaling 2964 stone and 294 bags. However, there were no registered sales of Ke Tao, early rice, foreign Indica, Du Indica, Wu Indica, white Yuan, or Yin Yuan.</p>
<p>There were no changes in the rice market yesterday. Flour was slightly firmer. Bran was stable. The uptake of Shantou wheat was sluggish, and prices softened. The supply of soybeans was strong, but the digestion was slow, and prices fell by 5600 yuan. Bean cake rebounded by 2300 yuan due to high inquiries in Shantou. Oil prices fell slightly by 1000 yuan due to the strong supply of goods from various sources and ordinary digestion. Peanut appetite was weak, also down 12,000 yuan. Beans were also down 1000 yuan.

<p>[Xuzhou Electric] After the Ministry of Economic Affairs sent personnel to take over and supplement the equipment of the Huadong (Jiawang) Coal Mine, the output was actively reorganized and increased from 300 tons per day to more than 1000 tons. However, most of the miners in the mine are farmers, and coal mining is only a secondary occupation. As it is now the busy farming season, most of the miners have abandoned work to farm, which has affected production. The output has been reduced to more than 300 tons. The mine has now increased wages and production bonuses and is implementing work competitions. The daily output has increased slightly recently to about 600 tons.</p>
<p>[Wuchang News] The Tutang area near Wuchang, Wuxie Maoqiushan Luoboutang and other places, have abundant reserves of bituminous coal. In recent years, the mining has relied on manual labor, resulting in low output. The larger scale one is Jianchang Company, whose daily output is only 5 tons. The company is actively engaged in innovation and plans to add machinery to prepare for large-scale production this fall.</p>
<h3 id="e124">Incoming Correspondence: Another Estimate of Cotton Yields - Losses of 30,000 to 50,000 Yuan Per Acre <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>Regarding Ms. Shi's statement in your newspaper article on the calculation of cotton yields, the cost items are missing two expenditures: fertilizer and taxes. Here is an estimate of cotton field yields and costs in the Nantong and Dongtai areas of northern Jiangsu for your reference.</p>
<p>1.  Yield: In good years, each acre can yield 130-140 *jin* (market weight) of seed cotton, while in bad years only 50-60 *jin*. Assuming that 3 *jin* of seed cotton yields 1 *jin* of ginned cotton, then each acre yields 20-40 *jin* of ginned cotton. The price of Shanghai fine short-staple cotton is 95,000 yuan per *dan* (Si Ma weight, approximately 1.25 *jin* market weight per *jin* Si Ma weight). In reality, cotton fields can only earn 15,000 yuan per acre in a typical year, and 30,000 yuan in a good year.</p>
<p>2.  Cost Expenditure: Cotton seeds cost about 2,000 yuan for 30 *jin* (market weight) per acre (according to current prices). For labor costs, including plowing wheat fields, planting, fertilizing, weeding, picking cotton, and removing cotton stalks, each acre requires at least 15 man-days. Each man-day is calculated at 5 *sheng* of rice (labor costs in northern Jiangsu are still low, including meals, cigarettes, and alcohol, each man-day is only 5 *sheng* of rice), requiring 45,000 yuan. Fertilizer costs 8,000 to 12,000 yuan (more fertilizer is needed for continuous cotton planting, less for intercropping cotton and rice). Land rent is approximately 5,000 to 7,000 yuan for 20-30 *jin* of seed cotton per acre. Taxes (in the Communist-controlled areas of northern Jiangsu, landowners and tenants each bear half) are about 3,000 yuan per acre. According to the above estimates, the income per acre is only 15,000 to 30,000 yuan, while the cost is 65,000 to 70,000 yuan, resulting in a loss of 35,000 to 55,000 yuan per harvest. Therefore, the low cotton price is a very unreasonable phenomenon. The current market price for "Golden Double Horse" 20-count yarn is 1.43 million yuan per bale. Each bale of yarn weighs 440 pounds net and requires 350 *jin* (Si Ma weight) of ginned cotton to produce (including cleaning losses). Adding labor costs, factory profits, and daily expenses, each bale of yarn is estimated to cost a maximum of 500,000 yuan. Therefore, a reasonable price for ginned cotton would be approximately 260,000 yuan per *Si Ma dan*. Before the war, each bale of yarn (20-count "Double Horse") cost about 140 yuan, and Tongzhou coarse cotton was priced at 22 yuan per *Si Ma dan*, while fine short-staple cotton was priced at 29 yuan per *Si Ma dan*. Thus, yarn prices have increased 10,000-fold, while cotton prices have only increased 4,000-fold. The excessive profits of spinning mills are too high, and cotton prices should be increased. Currently, the price of Tongzhou coarse cotton in the Communist-controlled areas of northern Jiangsu has reached 110,000 yuan per *market dan*. In reality, no cotton from northern Jiangsu is being shipped to Shanghai. This phenomenon of materials flowing to Communist-controlled areas is a significant blow to the government's economy. Fortunately, our government is paying attention to this. In addition, farmers mostly compensate for the losses in cotton planting with surpluses from early rice and income from side businesses. In terms of labor costs, if their own family members can handle it, they will not hire short-term workers and will exchange labor with neighbors. Moreover, they endure extreme hardship, just to get through this unreasonable period.</p>

<p>— By Our Reporter Xu Shou Lian</p>
<p>The main purpose of the Shanghai reporters' delegation's trip north was to observe the disaster situation in the areas of northern Jiangsu, Henan, and Shandong, the current state of transportation, and the various conditions in the Yellow River flooded areas. However, apart from these, the sights and sounds along the way also seemed to be quite interesting. Although the impressions are fragmented, perhaps they can allow readers in the Jiangnan area to learn a little about the scenery outside of Jiangnan.</p>
<h3 id="e126">Lead-Colored Sky - A Thick Cloud of Sand <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>A person who is used to living in the south will naturally feel different in every aspect of life when they suddenly go to the north, especially when the places they are going to are the cities along the western section of the Longhai Railway, such as Xuzhou, Kaifeng, and Zhengzhou, which were destroyed by eight years of war and whose vitality has not yet recovered. The first thing that makes you feel different is the wind and sand of the Central Plains. The reporter experienced the taste of wind and sand three times in the eleven-day trip. One time was in Zhengzhou, where the sky was a thick cloud of sand, rolling across the lead-colored sky—then, suddenly, it was dark and you couldn't see anything. In the house, you had to turn on the lights even during the day. When I was walking, I almost completely covered my face with a hat. When I got home, I saw that the brim of my hat had already accumulated a small sand dune.</p>
<h3 id="e127">Yellow River Carp - A Unique Flavor <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>When the reporters' delegation passed through Beijing, the office in Beijing specially hosted us at Liangyuan on Taiping Road. Liangyuan is a famous Henan restaurant, so we had already tasted Henan cuisine in Beijing. However, when I went to Henan myself, I realized that only a very small number of people in Henan can eat this kind of cuisine!</p>
<p>Henan has suffered from years of disasters and constant warfare since the beginning of the Anti-Japanese War. Few people can even afford *wowotou* (cornbread) to live on. It is unknown how many people cannot eat salt and sugar all year round. Millions of people are in urgent need of relief. The severity of the disaster is no less than that in the provinces of Hunan and Guangxi!</p>
<p>In most people's imagination, Yellow River carp should be the most common food in Henan, but that is not the case. In Kaifeng and Zhengzhou, Yellow River carp is an unparalleled delicacy to entertain distinguished guests, but a carp weighing more than two *jin* costs more than 10,000 yuan. There are many ways to cook Yellow River carp: sweet and sour, hot and sour, and even "one fish, three ways." The most delicious cooking method is called "Mrs. Fish," which is said to have been invented by the wife of the current Director of the Zhengzhou Pacification Headquarters, General Liu Jingfu (Zhi). It is to cook the Yellow River carp with bean sheets and a little chili. It has soup and is a bit like the spicy fish head in Shanghai.</p>

<p>The destruction of the eight-year war is terrible. Otherwise, how could there be housing shortages everywhere! Throughout the trip, the reporters' delegation found that the housing shortage was the most serious problem everywhere. However, based on what I saw, the housing shortage in Kaifeng and Zhengzhou is a real housing shortage, because here, even with gold bars, there is still no way to solve it. Some government agencies are still working in the rubble. It is many times more serious than the artificial housing shortage in Shanghai!</p>

<p>When visiting the western section of the Longhai Railway, we also took some time to visit many scenic spots and historical sites. In Xuzhou, the ancient city of Pengcheng, there is the Overlord Tower and the Overlord Palace left by Xiang Yu, all the way to Jiuli Mountain. In Kaifeng, there is the Yuwang Terrace, Xiangguo Temple, Iron Pagoda, and Dragon Pavilion, all of which are worth lingering over. In the Dragon Pavilion, the desolate image of Zhao Kuangyin can no longer be found. The residents have replaced him with the "Jade Emperor." But the magnificence of the Dragon Pavilion makes people long for the deeds of a generation of heroes. The villagers pointed out the distant former lakes of the Yang and Pan families of the Song Dynasty, as well as the place where Bao Longtu (Judge Bao) chopped Chen Shimei (a treacherous official) in the waist. Xiangguo Temple, one of the scenic spots, is as crowded as the City God Temple in Shanghai, with crowds of people, stalls, snacks, and street performers...almost the same as in Shanghai. But the architecture is really magnificent, stretching for about two *li* from the front gate to the scripture repository. Yuwang Terrace is the only scenic spot in Kaifeng, and it can be said to be the most beautiful scenic spot on the Longhai Line. Now, the Farmers' Association is running many orchards there. The architecture of Bishagang in Zhengzhou is also very magnificent. This is a memorial tower for national heroes, the memorial tower for Zhao Zhongyu, Tong Linge, and other heroes, which is currently under construction. It uses the four characters "Bixue Huangsha" (碧血黃沙 - blue blood and yellow sand) to commemorate the national martyrs of the north, which is indeed very appropriate.</p>

<p>In Kaifeng, we visited the experimental farm run by the Henan branch of the "Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration" (ERRRA) in Fanjiasi Village, Weishi County, in the Yellow River flooded area, ninety *li* away. On the way, we also paid tribute to Zhuxian Town, the famous site where Yue Wu Mu (Yue Fei) of the Southern Song Dynasty defeated the enemy. But what can be seen in Zhuxian Town now is only the towering earthen tower, which is left for future generations to pay tribute to. The Guanyu Temple now houses the First Provincial Nursery of Henan Province. This is an institution that specializes in sheltering child refugees. There are currently 467 male and female child refugees. The Henan branch of the "ERRRA" has provided a lot of supplies, so the nutrition and clothing of each child can still barely be maintained. This nursery is run very successfully, with strict discipline and special attention to physical exercise. Seeing these spirited children in Guanyu Temple in Zhuxian Town, it really makes people feel that China's youth has endless hope.</p>
<p>The newspaper industry in Xuzhou, Kaifeng, and Zhengzhou is quite developed, but it cannot be fully developed due to limited funds. There are five newspapers in Xuzhou, with the "Zhongbao" being larger in scale. There are nine in Kaifeng, including two evening newspapers. The "Minquan News" has the widest circulation, with one large sheet printed daily. There are five newspapers in Zhengzhou, the largest of which is the "Qunli News."</p>

<p>Since Nanjing banned dancing, the dance girls have gathered in the Huaihe River to accompany guests on boat tours, and countless women are secretly engaging in flesh and blood careers, struggling on the line of life. Since the arrival of General Xue Yue, the director of the Pacification Headquarters in Xuzhou, the tea dances held by the International Friendship Association every Wednesday and Saturday have also been banned. However, the "special zones" in Xuzhou, Kaifeng, and Zhengzhou all exist openly, with each of the three places having nearly 300 prostitutes. Xuzhou is dominated by Jiangsu prostitutes, while Kaifeng and Zhengzhou are mostly local prostitutes. Most of them are refugees who have fled from the "liberated areas." When the reporter's delegation returned to Shanghai, the authorities in Xuzhou had already issued an order on June 20 to these poor people, ordering them to close down all businesses within five days. The day after the order was issued, a tragedy occurred when a prostitute who could not make a living quietly committed suicide by drowning in a well! (June 26)</p>

<p>— By Our Reporter Xu Shou Lian</p>
<p>In 1938, when the National Government moved inland, Wuhan became the most watched place in all of China and the world. The military and civilians at the front and rear were united, holding the greatest determination—to defend Wuhan!</p>
<p>The enemy had long been preparing to strike Wuhan directly from North China along the Pinghan Railway. At that time, the commander of the enemy's North China Expeditionary Force was Nishio, and the one in charge of seizing the Pinghan Railway was the troops of Doihara, whom all 400 million of our compatriots hated to the bone. This cunning and vicious spy created the September 18th Incident and organized Gu Rengeng's puppet regime. At this time, he formally took on the role of the vanguard in invading our country!</p>
<p>Our army had long been prepared. In the area of Henan, the most elite 20th Army Corps at that time was gathered, with General Wan Fulin as the commander-in-chief. In this army corps were also the troops of Guan Linzheng and Hu Zongnan. In addition, there were brave men transferred from Guizhou and other places. The morale was high, the military appearance was neat, and they were waiting for Doihara to invade.</p>
<p>However, Doihara did not come.</p>
<p>Because, on the day of the Dragon Boat Festival, the 20th Army Corps received an order to breach the Yellow River dike at Huayuankou in Zhengzhou!</p>
<p>The execution of the order was by the New Fourth Division of the 53rd Army. From that day on, the Yellow River changed course. The sacrifice of the people of Henan was tragic, but victory requires a price. This breach caused the enemy's strategy to completely change, thus delaying the fall of Wuhan by fourteen months.</p>
<p>These fourteen months were the turning point in the history of our country and even the world. Without these fourteen months, perhaps the victory of the United Nations would not have been so quick and so thorough. The sacrifice of the people of Henan was not without reward.</p>

<p>We don't need to talk about the losses eight years ago, and even during the eight years. The following is part of the report from the Henan Provincial Government on the disaster situation of the Yellow River from the beginning of this year to June 10:</p>
<p>Luyi County Assembly: "The old course of the Yellow River has a peach flood, flowing in from the northwest of the county...about forty *li* long, the flooded area is about forty *li* long and wide...the wheat has been washed away, and it is difficult to sow in autumn, and the disaster has already formed this year..."</p>
<p>Lin Ying County Government: "...The river water has risen sharply, blocking the mouth and releasing water, gathering here, flooding more than 1,700 *mu* of fields, and those that were not flooded were also drowned, with no hope of harvest..."</p>
<p>Huaiyang County Assembly: "The Yellow River has risen sharply, causing floods and disasters, towns have been submerged, a vast ocean, the people who survived the disaster have suffered another flood, crying to the sky, and unable to survive..."</p>
<p>Xihua Seventh District Commissioner's Office: "...The Yellow River water has risen sharply for days, the flooded area is more than thirty *li* wide, the fields and crops have been destroyed, the cries of the displaced are everywhere, and 100,000 disaster victims are in urgent need of relief..."</p>
<p>Shenqiu County Government: "This county has suffered from the Yellow River flood for nine years...On the 7th of this month, the Yellow River water rose sharply, and its momentum was fierce, more severe than the autumn water of previous years, so that the planted wheat seedlings were all submerged, and the past houses were also washed away..."</p>
<p>Fugou County Assembly: "...The breach at Huayuankou has not been blocked, the flooded area is expanding day by day, and the disaster situation is increasing rather than decreasing...This year's summer flood will overflow, and the two townships of Sun and Yue in Hedong are particularly severely affected, a desolate scene, unbearable to see, and government orders cannot be implemented as a result...If the breach at Huayuankou is not blocked and closed early, the great flood will surely come again..."</p>
<p>There is no need to say more about the detailed losses. Let me quote a few sentences from the "Disaster Situation Record" issued by the Henan Provincial Government as a general narrative:</p>
<p>"...The eastern Henan Plain was originally known as a rich and prosperous area, but due to the Yellow River changing course and causing floods, more than 20 counties, including Zhongmou, Weishi, Fugou, and Xihua, have been deeply mired in the erosion of the Yellow River for eight years. Villages and towns have been submerged, and more than 1.7 million people have died or been injured! The remaining few high grounds protruding from the water are piled up with reed grass by the disaster victims to shelter them from the wind and rain, and the majority of the people have no home to return to, and they usually eat grass roots and tree bark to fill their stomachs. They are still continuing their wandering life..."</p>
<p>It also said: "In the past eight years, there have been 32 breaches, large and small, in official dikes and private embankments, totaling 91 places. The affected counties include Xihua, Yanling, Fugou, Huaiyang, Taikang, Suixian, Qixian, Weishi, Guangwu, Zhengxian, Zhecheng, Xiangcheng, Shangshui, Kaifeng, Luyi, Tongxu, Zhongmou, Weichuan, Shenqiu, and Chenliu, totaling 20 counties, with a death toll of more than 320,000 people (note: the actual number is 321,989 people)...The loss of houses is about 1.86 million, and the flooded land reaches more than 6.5 million *mu*!..."</p>
<p>This was a great war, a great victory. This victory did not come by chance. We did pay a very heavy price.</p>

<p>Dear Reporter, Taiwan has been taken over for eight months, and we will not talk about whether the measures of the Chief Executive's Office are reasonable, because this is a "major policy" and involves complex issues. Now there is a very simple matter that the Taiwan authorities have completely ignored, that is, the stamps in Taiwan. To this day, they are still using the old stamps of the "Great Japanese Empire Postal Service," which are only stamped with the seven characters "Taiwan Province, Republic of China" (sample attached). I wonder what the Taiwan Provincial Authorities intend to do? Use waste? Do they even see these small pieces of paper? They could have been used for the first few months, but why are they still being used today? Does Taiwan not have printing plants? Why not print them in Shanghai? Why not follow the example of the Northeast and transport domestic stamps there and stamp them with the words "Limited to Use in Taiwan Province"? This would save trouble and also take into account Taiwan's monetary system. This is not a small matter! It concerns the entire national system and can symbolize whether the country is unified. The Chinese Communists are printing separate "Border Area" stamps in order to secede. What do the Taiwan authorities mean by this?</p>

<h3 id="e136">Garbage Piles Up Like Mountains <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>Dear Editor, On the sidewalk in front of Zhongxin Elementary School, south of the northern section of Wenchang Road, near the new garbage bridge in this city, garbage is piled up like mountains. It is said that this garbage was discarded by the warehouse of the nearby China Industrial Bank, and it has been there for many days. It is rained on and sunned, and the stench is steaming. All the passersby cover their noses. The elementary school students are only about ten years old, and their physique is weak, so they are most susceptible to infectious diseases. If this accumulation of garbage is not cleared up quickly, the impact on health is unimaginable! The street sweepers, who are responsible for cleaning the roads, turn a blind eye and do not ask about it. However, although the garbage does not move automatically, the epidemic has already spread without warning, so how can you not be afraid! The sanitation authorities probably have not noticed it because the area of the city is vast. I hope you can pay attention to it. Otherwise, if you work hard to prevent epidemics on the one hand, and allow them to be created on the other hand, I am afraid that the effect on public health will be twice the effort.</p>

<h3 id="e137">The Coffin Storage Center Raises Prices Again and Again! <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>Dear Editor, When the war in Shanghai first broke out, my wife passed away in Shanghai, and I temporarily placed her coffin in the ordinary room of the Puan Coffin Storage Center on Daxilu Road, which cost 12 yuan per year. Since then, the price has been increased year by year, and starting this month, it has increased to more than 38,000 yuan per year. The facilities of the center are simple, covered only with reed mats, and have not been repaired for seven or eight years. Moreover, there are often four or five coffins stacked on top of each other. If I want to move the coffin back to my hometown for burial, they also demand more than 100,000 yuan for coffin removal fees, sanitation donations, and handling fees. With such continuous increases, how can ordinary people afford it? I would like to ask the municipal authorities, housing in this city is only calculated at 140 times the pre-war rate, so why should the coffin storage fee be increased by three or four thousand times? I urge the wise authorities to quickly stop this in order to relieve the people's suffering.</p>

<h3 id="e138">Blocking the Breach and Work Relief <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>Victory has finally come. The United Nations has not forgotten the heroic sacrifices of thousands of Chinese compatriots. The American Yellow River expert Oliver J. Todd has taken on the mission of blocking the breach at Huayuankou. He said, "No matter how serious this 'Chinese disaster' is, I will complete the work of blocking the breach before July 1!"</p>
<p>The American engineers were skeptical of this bold statement, but Todd resolutely went to China. On March 1, the project to block the Yellow River breach and restore the dikes began.</p>
<p>The "breach" at Huayuankou was already 1,460 meters wide when the project started. In the past few months, the 800-meter-long western section of the earthen dike has been completed. At the time the reporter wrote this manuscript, I heard that the remaining 660 meters have also been completed, and it is time to "close the gap."</p>
<p>The "UNRRA" has indeed helped us a lot. The vehicles sent to the project area include jeeps, amphibious vehicles, excavators, cranes, and various earthmoving and pile-driving machines. In addition, there are many wood, piles, and cement, but the most substantial is the work relief method. In the Huayuankou area, there are now more than 10,000 refugees working hard. In their spare time after work, there are still some recreational activities. Some people sing *dagu* (a type of Chinese ballad) or perform *xiangsheng* (comic dialogue), allowing these tired fighters to get some relaxation.</p>
<p>Recently, 19 tractors transported by "UNRRA" to China have begun to replace manual labor in the Yellow River flooded area—Fanjia Village, Weishi County, Henan Province—to revive our post-war rural areas. This kind of tractor is still a pioneering endeavor in China's backward rural areas, so we must first train drivers and study its mechanical structure, management, and maintenance. The first batch of 28 trainees are all graduates of agricultural universities. Since the beginning of May, 2,500 *mu* of land has been reclaimed by them on this boundless wilderness.</p>
<p>Each of these tractors has 12 horsepower, but it cannot exert its power against larger grass roots and willow roots, as well as broken walls and ruins buried in the sand. Therefore, human labor has to be used. Therefore, the Henan branch of the "ERRRA" has employed more than 1,000 refugees here, who are engaged in cleaning work such as removing grass and pulling roots every day. The cost of eight hours of labor per day is 2.5 *jin* of flour and 150 yuan in legal currency. At noon, there is also a large bowl of thin porridge cooked with beans, millet, green vegetables, and salt, which is considered the richest meal in the disaster area. In addition, there are 78 tents for them to live in, and each tent can accommodate 18 people. Recently, the branch is also planning to set up a cooperative.</p>
<p>However, such work only accounts for one-four-hundredth of the vast Yellow River flooded area today. The most important part of the dike construction is in the Communist-controlled area. They do not trust anyone and believe that the dike construction has ulterior motives. Therefore, they initially opposed it desperately, then destroyed the machines. Now, Todd has rushed to the Communist-controlled area to discuss the work with them.</p>
<p>The autumn flood is coming soon, and we cannot afford the Communist Party's "delay after delay"!</p>
<p>Todd said: If everything goes smoothly, then two-thirds to three-quarters of the Yellow River's water volume can flow into the old course. After all the downstream dikes are repaired and strengthened in the fall, all the water flow can be returned to the old course. Then, we can talk about irrigation and drainage.</p>
<p>May the Chinese Communists remember General Marshall's words: "Victory does not come easily, we must not waste this victory!" (June 26, Shanghai)</p>

<p>Legal Questions</p>
<p>(1) Huang Yaoyu from Pinghu asks: There are two direct paternal brothers, the elder brother has no son, so the younger brother's son is adopted as his heir. When the adoptive grandmother was still alive, the fields were divided, and each held a deed as proof. Now the adoptive grandmother has passed away, and the adopted son has reached adulthood, but the adoptive mother does not abide by the division deed, but manages the property herself and monopolizes the benefits. The legal questions are as follows: (1) Now that the adopted son is an adult, can he manage the land according to the division deed? (2) Is it valid for the adopted son to entrust his biological father to collect the rent? (3) The property for the adoptive grandmother's meals, was promised to be managed by the two grandsons during her lifetime (there are witnesses). Is it legal to manage it? (4) If the adoptive mother does not abide by the law and the contract, and conceals the property, what procedures should be followed? (5) In order to swallow the fields, she accused the adopted son's biological father of being a guerrilla and sued him to the enemy and puppets, causing him to be detained for a long time. Which current laws can be cited?</p>
<p>[Lawyer Zhu Yakui answers] The system of inheriting the ancestral line has been abolished under current law. If the adopted son was adopted after May 5, 1931, his legal status can only be considered as an adopted son. (1) An adult son can naturally manage the property. (2) Valid. (3) Evidence of permission is required. (4) Mediation for handover can be requested. If it is still ineffective, a lawsuit should be filed in court for a judgment. (5) If losses have been suffered, compensation can be claimed.</p>
<p>(2) Yang Yiren asks: In 1928, I accepted the mortgage of several acres of fields. The deed stated that the term was six years. After the term expired, the original middleman repeatedly urged the mortgager to redeem the land, but because the mortgage price was higher than the selling price within the statutory period, the mortgager had no intention of redeeming and voluntarily gave up. I then registered with the Land Bureau and obtained ownership of the mortgaged property. Unexpectedly, in March 1941, the mortgager used the power of the enemy and puppets to forcibly redeem the land. At that time, I was forced to hand over all the printed receipts. I still have the deed and related documents that have not been handed over. I would like to ask the following questions: (1) Can the forced redemption relying on enemy power, which does not comply with the law, be denied? (2) Can the deed and related documents be used as evidence to deny the redemption of the field? (3) What procedures should be followed to regain ownership of the mortgaged property?</p>
<p>[Lawyer Zhu Yakui answers] If there is solid evidence of being forced, it can be denied. (2) It can be used as reference evidence, but not as evidence of being forced. (3) First conduct mediation. If it is ineffective, legal remedies can be sought.</p>

<p>Sincerely Request Agricultural Chemists to Provide Solutions</p>
<p>To the Editor of Shen Bao Social Services: The majority of tenant farmers in our country are constantly struggling in hunger and cold after paying rent. What they usually rely on to maintain their livelihood is mainly raising pigs and chickens for eggs, which are the main sideline products, used as a means of relief and nutritional needs. However, the countryside follows old customs and does not know how to research and improve. In Yongkang, Zhejiang, there is always one or three or four outbreaks of pig wasting disease and chicken plague every year. The spread is very rapid, and it is completely wiped out in a few days. The heavy losses often affect the lives of the whole family. Some people say that the use of Wan Jin You (Tiger Balm) and Da Wang Oil can treat pig and chicken plague, but few are effective. I believe there must be effective medicines with experience at home and abroad. Please publish them in the Social Services column and widely seek them, with a focus on simplicity and suitability for the rural economy. This is also a great act of benevolence and virtue to help the urgent needs of the countryside. Xu Jiaopin from Mou Dian, Yongkang.</p>

<p>— Correspondence from Kaifeng, 21st Fan Hong</p>
<p>Using tractors to plow and harrow farmland is not only surprising in Henan, but also in China, and is an important reform in agriculture.</p>
<p>We took a car from the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration in the morning, left the South Gate, and went south, driving entirely on sandy roads. We couldn't see villages or trees, only the remaining half-broken walls, which were the relics of old villages. Zhuxian Town has also become a desolate place with a half-broken gate and no smoke. Further ahead to Mengzhuang, the same weeds occupied everything, and no trace of relics could be seen. The residents had long disappeared somewhere.</p>
<p>Plowing Once, Harrowing Once</p>
<p>There was a grassland deeper than people, and the car drove through the grass. People teased with weeds and looked at the endless plains. It was the homeland of the people in Central Plains who had been barren for seven or eight years. We couldn't help but shed a few tears of sympathy for those who had fled and died!</p>
<p>Further ahead to Fanzhuang, the site of tractor use. There were more than twenty people being trained by American technicians, all wearing country farmers' clothes, working hard to practice and learn. A large row of tents was where they rested. In addition, many returning Pan District people were digging tree roots and cutting grass. In addition to food, they also received more than one hundred yuan for pocket money every day. They were workers hired by the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration's work-for-relief program. After clearing weeds and tree roots in a certain area, the tractor began to climb on the flat ground. The first time was plowing, and the second time was harrowing. Approximately, each machine can plow 60 mu of land per day, and 40 square feet per minute. It uses 15 gallons of gasoline per day, plows one foot deep and two feet wide. Each tractor carries two plow surfaces, so the plowed area is smaller. The Northwest Agricultural and Forestry College once had one of these tractors, but it was not used much and did not receive much attention.</p>
<p>After the tractor plowed, the new soil from the ground was turned up, and the weeds on the ground were turned down. This is an extremely fertile sandy loam. If wheat is planted in the fall, there will definitely be a very satisfactory harvest next year. It has been barren for seven or eight years. Seven or eight years of land rest, plus the fertile silt carried by the Yellow River, have created important factors for large-scale production in the future. We wish that this land, which has suffered the greatest harm, can become the most fertile soil, bringing the richest agricultural products to people every year.</p>
<p>Allocate a Little More Energy</p>
<p>This is now a farm run by the Yellow River Pan District Rehabilitation and Construction Guidance Committee and the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration. There are also many staff members. There are already nineteen tractors, and the total allocation is fifty. The cultivated land has more than five hundred mu. Compared with the more than two million mu of wasteland, how far is the distance! I remember when I was in Chongqing, I heard that the tractors the United States gave us were to solve the difficulties of the loss of cattle in Henan (a loss of three-quarters, reaching more than 4 million). They were all supplied to Henan. At that time, it was said that Chinese people would not use them, and many people were struggling. Now, the allocated number is far from the total number, and only the Yellow River Pan District is being paid attention to, and it is still not enough. According to the working range and area of the tractor, the large plains of eastern and southern Henan are ideal working areas. The mountain basins in western Henan also have great uses. Speaking from the perspective of Henan Province, I hope to allocate a little more to the province to relieve and rehabilitate the rural areas that have suffered from droughts, plagues, and locusts for a long time.</p>
<p>Restore Rural Production</p>
<p>Seeing the use of tractors, we know that the scientification and mechanization of Chinese agriculture is not too difficult. Using these small farm tools does not necessarily require re-planning the area of domestic cultivated land and expanding the area of cultivated land. But we should pay attention to how to imitate and how to repair them. If these problems are solved, Chinese agriculture will definitely have a major revolution.</p>
<p>The Yellow River destroyed the fields and homes of the Pan District people, washed away the lives of wives, mothers, and daughters, and destroyed all their hopes... Now their fate has been brought back by the new type of tractor, their hope has been brought back, and our rural prosperity has also been brought back!</p>
<p>In the fading twilight, we returned excitedly in a jeep.</p>

<h3 id="e144">A Visit to the Great Airfield <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>— Shao Fu</p>
<p>Two days ago, I had the opportunity to visit the Eighth Air Group of the great airfield. I got up early and spent a day wandering around the group headquarters and the airfield. Although I was tired, I gained a lot, especially the enthusiasm of the several Air Force friends in the Eighth Air Group.</p>
<p>For the past eight years, I have had a special and high regard for Air Force friends. It is not entirely because of their dangerous work and heroic combat, shouldering the difficult tasks under aerial disadvantage, but also because of the simple hearts of each of them, their burning enthusiasm, and their frank and sincere attitude. They are like brothers to each other, and they are so kind and straightforward to others. They are like children, pure. They seem to be fairies, and the ugliness of the world is irrelevant to them.</p>
<p>This kind of life situation cannot help but make me feel a high degree of affection for them.</p>
<p>During this visit, I ate a lunch of their "Air Force provisions," visited their dormitory, management office, runway, and B24 aircraft. I have many thoughts upon returning, but I will only mention two points here:</p>
<p>The first point is that their lives are not as enjoyable and comfortable as we imagine. More than a thousand people are squeezed into those small bungalows, eight or ten people in a room, and even double-deck bunks. So the soldiers have to live in temporary tents.</p>
<p>The second point is that in that desolate countryside, they lack mental stimulation besides work and often feel very depressed. Going to the city is far away, time-consuming, and costly. Therefore, they are very welcome to have friends come and talk to them.</p>
<p>The Eighth Air Group of the Air Force is composed of the most outstanding personnel who have been selected. They are working hard to open up China's maritime routes. I hope everyone can comfort them.</p>
<h3 id="e145">Tanks Enter Hujiang <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>— Bao Zhongqi</p>
<p>A Thrilling Battlefield Performance</p>
<p>Since Major Chiang Wei-kuo attended the morning assembly at Hujiang University on June 3, the students of Hujiang University have completely integrated with his men, and the relationship is very harmonious. The student fellowships of Hujiang often invite their officers to give lectures on the situation on the India-Burma battlefield, or invite them to participate in ball games. On June 21, Major Chiang personally led the soldiers of the First Tank Battalion of the Chinese Armored Corps to Hujiang University to perform tank maneuvers.</p>
<p>After hearing the news, the students were all overjoyed and excited. Students with cameras also prepared their films in advance to avoid losing this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. The school suddenly became chaotic, as if facing a formidable enemy.</p>
<p>Many students were already standing at the gate waiting after lunch. Finally, amidst the enthusiastic expectations of nearly a thousand students, six M3A3 large tanks drove into the main gate of Hujiang University. Subsequently, Major Chiang Wei-kuo and his wife also arrived by car. The tank maneuver performance began amidst the enthusiastic applause.</p>
<p>Major Chiang jumped onto the temporary command platform and said a few words into the microphone. Then he introduced Captain Cai, Zhou, and Tang, who were in charge of the performance. They were all officers who had been highly regarded during the India-Burma campaign and were very happy to participate in the performance today.</p>
<p>Under Captain Cai's orders, Platoon Leader Tang commanded four tanks to start moving forward. He sat in the command tank with a green flag and relayed orders via radio. Each tank had four warriors: the radio operator, driver, gunner, and shooter. At this time, the students with cameras began their activity, capturing all kinds of angles, high, low, left, and right, leaving a precious page in the history of Hujiang.</p>
<p>At this time, five tanks were performing "performance demonstrations." Platoon Leader Tang's car took the lead, climbing a very high mud pile, with an inclination of nearly forty degrees, as if it were about to overturn. All of us, without battlefield experience, were frightened by the dangerous situation and screamed. Especially the female students at the windows of the girls' dormitory, looking down from a height, felt even more frightened. But the driver skillfully grasped the control stick (equivalent to the steering wheel on a car) and steadily crossed the mud pile. According to Major General Chiang, because of the limitations of the venue, the performance was not sufficient. On the India-Burma battlefield, driving over a small wooden bridge with only one side of the track was really dangerous! But every student was very satisfied with today's tank performance demonstration.</p>
<p>Next was "formation exercise." Three or four tanks were formed into a team, or lined up in a horizontal line, which is suitable for attacking and covering the advance of large troops; or lined up in a column, used for marching and frontal breakthroughs against the enemy; or lined up in a trapezoid, which is used to cover one's own flanks and surround the enemy's flanks; later, the wedge formation used for searching and advancing was demonstrated; finally, the anti-wedge team, which is beneficial for attacking the enemy's position, was closely arranged and connected, which was very spectacular. The performance exhausted all possible changes, making people feel as if they were lost in a fog.</p>
<p>After the "formation exercise" was completed, "battlefield rescue" was demonstrated. Assuming a tank is trapped in a difficult situation, unable to extricate itself and losing combat effectiveness, the tank will issue a distress whistle signal. At the same time, the personnel in the car also carried out machine guns, submachine guns and other weapons to get off the car and lie down to cover, so as to avoid being destroyed by the enemy. Until other rescue tanks arrive, use a cable to tow it to a safe location, and then inspect and repair it to restore its combat effectiveness.</p>
<p>Finally, after demonstrating the use of other tank formations, the application of periscopes, and the technique of aiming at the enemy and shooting, this great performance came to an end.</p>
<p>At this time, Chiang Wei-kuo spoke on the stage again: "Students, today's performance is over. Unfortunately, because of the limitations of the venue and the time, we could not use more tanks to perform more great programs. If we performed as much as possible, then your school's campus, which has not been repaired for a long time after the restoration of the school, will suffer greater losses." Indeed, the power of the tank is too amazing. Two very thick trees have been crushed by it. Deep car marks are also engraved on the grass, forming a criss-crossing pattern. There are also ruined walls and broken walls that were destroyed by the enemy during the war, which have been swept away by the tanks today.</p>
<p>After the exercise, Major Chiang Wei-kuo gave instructions to the twenty-odd officers and soldiers who participated in the performance, encouraging them greatly, and shook hands with each commander one by one. The officers and soldiers stood at attention and saluted, and then stepped onto the tanks that had galloped on the India-Burma battlefield to return to the camp. Major Chiang Wei-kuo also entered the car with his wife under the concentrated photography of more than a dozen cameras.</p>

<p>Because of my love for reading, I have accumulated a lot of thread-bound books over the past twenty years. Among them, some were bought with a lot of money, and some were rare editions. I have always enjoyed touching them and flipping through them when I felt like it, often from day to night. Naturally, I have lost many during the more than twenty years of wandering, but because they are my beloved possessions, I prepared for each escape in advance. Fortunately, I have lost very few. Among these six hundred books, I have really had a relationship with them for more than twenty years, and I am very grateful to them for giving me a lot of knowledge over the years.</p>
<p>I have put a lot of effort into preserving them for many years, fearing that they would get moldy, so I carefully exposed them to the sun; fearing that they would be eaten by worms, I sprinkled stinky powder and hid peppercorns. No matter how poor or sick I was, I had to tidy them up, wipe the dust, and sort out the damaged pages every day. If I didn't work hard for several hours, I wouldn't stop. However, now I can no longer preserve them because of poverty and illness. The illness cannot be delayed for treatment, and at the same time, there are many mouths to feed in my family. Therefore, after pawning everything, I have to abandon them.</p>
<p>At first, my thoughts only turned to English books. I thought that after the victory, traffic would be unimpeded, and culture would restore the previous communication. As long as I had money, I wouldn't worry about not being able to buy English books. So I sold them to the old bookstore in whole numbers to get a visible price back. But I kept one book, "The Opium Clippers." That book was a gift from an American friend, and it was not sold on the market. It is said that there are no three copies in Hong Kong. It wasn't for these reasons that I wanted to save it, but to commemorate a friend's gift.</p>
<p>Now, even those rare editions are difficult to maintain my relationship with. I am forced to give them up again. Giving them up can allow me to exchange for a lot of medicine to treat my illness and the material to feed a group of parasites. People are always planning in this regard, right? I have become so burdened that I don't even want to continue being a human being.</p>
<p>From this batch of books, I recovered two relatively complete books from the Ming edition books. One is "Spring and Autumn Dew Commentary", and the other is "Xie Xuan Cheng Collection". There is only one volume of "Xie Xuan Cheng Collection". After the reinstallation by the book collector, the words "Gaozhai Reading Book" are written in red characters on the cover, and the small characters "Xie Xuan Cheng Collection Ming Zhang's 130 original engraved copy reinstalled on the 19th of October, Bingzi" are written in ink. "Chun Qiu Fan Lu Ping" is two books into one. There is a Pingyuan's knowledge after the preface, "Ming edition Dongzi, collected by Chen Xiaolian Tingying; after Xiaolian died, the book was scattered, and this copy was purchased by Pingyuan. Mr. Ye Chubai, and Yuan were colleagues in Jiaozhong School for five years, working hard without boasting, simple and quiet, for many years. Is it what Dongzi said, "Correct his righteousness without seeking his benefit, and understand his Tao without considering his merit"? Now I will leave this booklet to be sent when I go north, and I will record my admiration." "Pingyuan presented it with respect and recorded it in January of the third year of Xuantong".</p>
<p>I still have a relationship to keep these two books, not just because they are relatively complete, but because books are no longer worth money. Even if I sell them together, it won't increase the price much, so it's better to keep some.</p>
<p>Some people say that a son selling his ancestors' collection of books is a parasite. Then, my selling my own collection of books can be considered my own parasite!</p>
<h3 id="e147">Seal Words and Seal Character <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>

<p>A country has national character, and a person has personal character. A seal also has seal character. Zhao Menglei of the Song Dynasty had excellent calligraphy, but his character in calligraphy was reduced because he served the Yuan Dynasty. Patriotic people would rather not hang it in their hall, or even burn it. Another Mr. (forget his surname) who is good at writing withered vine characters is a patriotic man with a national concept. When the enemy came to ask for police, knowing that it could not be refused, he raised a kitchen knife and cut off his arm to refuse. Because in a dispute between two countries, each should unconditionally do their best for their country, and that is what I mean by seal character. Moreover, art is a representative of national culture, and the identity of our artists can be imagined. We should respect and value ourselves. The government does pay attention to art and wants to catch up with other countries. Before the war, I saw the government allocate huge sums of money in Beijing to build the National Art Exhibition Hall, which still stands tall on Nanjing Guofu Road, which can be a proof. It may not be able to make direct material awards, and there are real difficulties. Artists should forgive it. During the nine years of the Anti-Japanese War, Shanghai was the largest city in our country. Have none of the seal engravers in Shanghai ever spoke for the enemy and puppets? This is also shameful.</p>

<p>One of the American millionaires, Thomas Lipton, was always taking care of the store affairs in his father's grocery store when he was young. His calculations were never wrong, making up for the lack of his father's ability to handle affairs. One day, when the old man sold half a dozen eggs to a customer, he looked very unhappy. After the customer left, he said:</p>
<p>"Father, you should let mother sell these eggs."</p>
<p>"Why?" his father said in surprise.</p>
<p>"Mother's hands are smaller than yours, so the eggs can look bigger." Lipton replied. (Translated from Capper's Weekly)</p>
<h3 id="e149">The Holy Spring of the North, The Wise Spring of the South: Chongqing's Hot Springs <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>— Deng Qi</p>
<p>Around Chongqing, there are four hot springs in the east, south, west, and north. Of these, the east and west hot springs are quite far from Chongqing and not within the jurisdiction of the Chongqing city area, so they are not very well-known. However, the south and north springs are within Chongqing's boundaries, facing each other, with beautiful scenery. Visitors to Chongqing rarely miss a trip to these places.</p>
<p>The North Hot Spring is located more than seventy kilometers north of Chongqing city in Beibei. From Chongqing to Beibei, you can take a bus or a boat up the Jialing River.</p>
<p>Beibei is a new type of small metropolis. Some people even call it "Little Chongqing." It has all the essence of Chongqing, as well as extremely complete recreational facilities. However, it does not have Chongqing's ubiquitous dust and bustling city noise.</p>
<p>Taking a boat up the Jialing River, you arrive at Beibei. From Beibei, walking slowly along the Jialing River for four or five kilometers, you reach the North Hot Spring. The North Hot Spring occupies the mountainside of Wentang Gorge, with high gorges facing each other on both sides. Climbing ten steps, you can overlook Beibei, Xiaba, and Chongqing faintly in the distance. Looking down, you see the leisurely sails swaying on the Jialing River. Behind the North Spring is the towering Jinyun Mountain, with ancient trees concealing the beautiful peaks, giving it a truly extraordinary aura.</p>
<p>The North Spring has a park, a bathhouse, a swimming pool, a lotus pond, the Rushan Cave, and the Yangshan Pavilion. Bamboo forests, flowers, and spring water circulate and flow through the rocks everywhere. It is said that because of the geothermal heat in the north, the flowers and trees have a unique advantage, blooming early and fading late. The hot spring bathhouse "Huanchen," built on the left side of the Wentang Gorge mountainside, is fully equipped. In addition to a dozen or so bathhouses, there are indoor and outdoor swimming pools. After bathing, you can rest in the riverside tea shop, then walk along the winding stone path to Jinyun Mountain, the farm, and the Gang Library in the Glass Palace. The library has a large collection of books and antiques, among which the "Han Washbasin" is the most precious (note). It is truly a rare treasure, but it is only open for exhibition on holidays.</p>
<p>From the Chongqing city area, across the Yangtze River, to Haitangxi Station, take a bus for about 25 kilometers, passing Xiaowenquan and the Central Political School, you can reach the South Hot Spring. Peach and willow trees line the banks, encircling the foothills. Tourists flock here year-round. In the hot summer months, people come here to escape the heat. With a gentle breeze, the fragrance of flowers, and the songs of birds, how can there still be any suffering from the scorching heat?</p>
<p>The vicinity of the South Hot Spring is a village market in a rural area. A neat road, with white poplar trees on both sides, dense branches and leaves, shading the buildings, cleverly resembling entering a tranquil and pleasant courtyard.</p>
<p>Inside the South Hot Spring, there is the Xiaowenquan (in the Political School), a well-equipped hotel, restaurants, a library, a garden, and bathing places with bathhouses and swimming pools. The spring water is warm and clean. Embracing it in the water, or sitting at the spring vent, letting the agreeable spring water rush and flow, one's heart feels warm and comfortable, and all the accumulated fatigue of body and mind is washed away.</p>
<p>"The South Spring is Wise, the North Spring is Holy." I love Chongqing's North and South Hot Springs. I love the beauty of the North Spring, but I also like the charm of the South Spring…</p>
<p>Note: The Han Washbasin is a relic from the Tang Dynasty, shaped like a water basin made of alloy. The bottom of the basin is engraved with four relief carp, and each side of the rim has an ear. After adding water to the basin, rub the ears with your hands. Gently rubbing produces a clear sound, and as you gradually add water, the humming sound becomes as loud as a steam whistle, with a soft, melodious, and solemn tone. At this time, the water in the basin is seen to be sprayed from the four carp at the bottom of the basin, continuously, with the water flowers jumping, like a spring. The water flowers can reach a foot high, and when illuminated against the light, the water appears rainbow-colored, truly a spectacle.</p>

<p>American military police in Korea ordered the people of Incheon not to ride on the outside of buses. One day, they patrolled in Jeeps and dragged down several civilians who were riding in a uncivilized manner. The passengers protested in vain. Finally, except for one person, the rest began to walk. Suddenly, that boor followed the slowly moving car and jumped onto it. The military police hurriedly caught up and dragged him to the side of the road again. But in the blink of an eye, he climbed onto the car again. At this time, the Americans walking along the road criticized them one after another, irritating the military police, who drove the man into the Jeep and took him to headquarters. They asked a translator to investigate why he was so daring. But upon asking, it turned out that he was the ticket seller!</p>

<p>All Kinds of Coins and Checks</p>
<p>The collection of various currencies in the collection department of Citibank in New York is truly a spectacle. At the same time, the horror of inflation can also be seen from here.</p>
<p>There, is a German coin from after the First World War, worth 1,000,000,000,000 Marks. In Germany in 1923, such an astronomical number of coins was only used for small change. However, if calculated at the value of the Mark in 1914, perhaps all the gold in the world would not be enough to mint such a coin.</p>
<p>Greece under German and Italian occupation during the Second World War is another terrible example of inflation. In 1941, the highest denomination banknote was 1,000 Drachmas. By 1944, the highest denomination had reached 5,000,000 Drachmas.</p>
<p>The bank has collected 60,000 kinds of currency, enough to represent the currencies of various periods in history. There are Egyptian round coins from 5,000 years ago, to the Roosevelt dimes issued in January of this year, the earliest Chinese banknotes from the Ming Dynasty, and counterfeit coins from the Central Reserve Bank.</p>
<p>In addition, there are many other kinds of currency: woodpecker skulls, elephant tails, Mauser bullets, tea bricks, fish hooks, whale teeth, rubber balls, etc.</p>
<p>The highest denomination check on display is $22,500,000, issued by Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, and the lowest denomination is one cent, issued by the famous blind woman Helen Keller.</p>

<h3 id="e154">The Origins and Whereabouts of Typhoid Bacteria <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>— Guo Keda, Chen Wenlong</p>
<p>Before discussing the pathogen of typhoid fever, we must first rectify the name. In ancient Chinese medicine, there is a famous book called "Treatise on Cold Damage Diseases," in which the symptoms discussed do include a portion that belongs to true typhoid fever, but many parts describe other acute infections. Even in the early days of the development of scientific medicine in the West, it was not easy to distinguish typhoid fever from other similar diseases clinically, so the ancient records are all mixed up and unclear. Since the modern development of bacteriology and serology, this rather complex problem has been clarified. Now we know that typhoid fever refers to an acute infectious disease caused by *Salmonella typhi*. A type of typhoid fever with more severe symptoms is caused by *Salmonella paratyphi*, called "paratyphoid fever." *Salmonella paratyphi* cannot be distinguished from *Salmonella typhi* morphologically, but there are obvious differences in biochemical and serological reactions. As for epidemic typhus, it is a completely different disease. Although the symptoms are similar in some respects, the differences are still many, and the pathogen itself is completely different from *Salmonella typhi*. The pathogen of epidemic typhus, "Rickettsia," was discovered by Ricketts. This small body cannot be stained with ordinary bacterial staining methods, nor can it be cultured on ordinary bacterial culture media. It can only reproduce in living cells, so its culture cannot be achieved without using living animals or tissue culture methods or chicken embryo methods. Moreover, the transmission of typhoid fever is directly through the mouth into the gastrointestinal system, while epidemic typhus is transmitted by fleas.</p>
<p>*Salmonella typhi* is very small and cannot be seen with the naked eye. It can only be observed under a microscope, with an axial shape, a short rod shape, and slightly blunt round ends. It has more than ten flagella around it, so it can move vigorously.</p>
<p>*Salmonella typhi* is easy to culture. It can be grown smoothly in a slightly alkaline or in a medium like Xima's. The most suitable breeding temperature is about the same as normal human body temperature. But in nature, it is also possible to find opportunities for its survival. In ice, typhoid bacteria can survive for several weeks, so unsterilized ice cubes or unclean ice cream are dangerous for transmission. Its resistance to heat is relatively weak. A temperature of 56 degrees Celsius maintained for two minutes can kill it. It dies instantly in boiling water at 100 degrees, so there will be no typhoid bacteria in boiling water.</p>
<p>The main source of transmission of *Salmonella typhi* is the patient's stool and urine, because the patient's stool and urine can contain a lot of *Salmonella typhi*. Sometimes, even though the disease has healed, the stool and urine can still carry bacteria. There are also some healthy people whose bodies have strong resistance, or who have been vaccinated, so even though bacteria have entered the body, there are no clinical symptoms. These two types of people, who appear healthy but actually carry bacteria, are very dangerous to society because they can transmit the bacteria to other healthy people.</p>
<p>The transmission route of typhoid fever is exactly in line with what we often say: "Disease enters through the mouth." Bacteria enter people's digestive systems directly or indirectly through water, food, fingers, and utensils.</p>
<p>Water is a very important part of transmission, because water often comes into contact with feces and urine. Rivers, ditches, and spring water have the most opportunities to be contaminated with bacteria. In cities, if there are cracks in the water pipes, tap water may also become a transmission medium, so drinking raw water always carries the risk of contracting infectious diseases.</p>
<p>In terms of food, milk is a good culture medium for typhoid bacteria. At the same time, after the bacteria grow in milk, there are no obvious changes, making it difficult for drinkers to detect, so it is easy to spread the typhoid bacteria. Most of the typhoid bacteria come from workers carrying bacteria in the dairy farm, or from subscribers to typhoid fever. Milk bottles from these patients carry the bacteria out. In addition to milk, raw tea and shellfish may also be sources of transmission. Fruits, melons, and raw water have an inseparable relationship with flies, so they are very dangerous for transmission. Flies are naturally the most frightening. They mechanically attach bacteria from feces to their hairy feet and then distribute them to food, or directly send them to our lips, thus accelerating the spread of transmission.</p>
<p>Fingers and tableware, due to contact with patients, or because they touch raw water and flies, are easily used indirectly as transmission media.</p>
<p>After *Salmonella typhi* enters the oral cavity, it passes through the stomach and reaches the lymphatic tissue of the intestinal tract. Because of the proliferation of bacteria, the local lymphatic tissue becomes swollen. From the mesenteric lymphatic vessels, the bacteria enter the blood circulation, so in the first week of the illness, we can culture *Salmonella typhi* from the patient's blood. After the kidneys are invaded, the bacteria can migrate from the blood to the urinary system, so we can often find bacteria in the patient's urine. In the intestinal tract, after the intestinal lymphatic tissue is destroyed, there are large amounts of *Salmonella typhi* in the stool. These bacteria are excreted from the patient's body with the stool, and then begin to infect another healthy person, or are eliminated.</p>
<p>The gallbladder is the most suitable place for *Salmonella typhi* to grow and reproduce. After the bacteria multiply in the gallbladder, they continue to flow with the bile into the small intestine, and then are excreted from the body with the stool from the intestinal tract. There are two possible routes for *Salmonella typhi* to reach the gallbladder: one is to flow back up the bile duct from the small intestine to reach the gallbladder; the second is to reach the gallbladder from the blood through the liver circulation. *Salmonella typhi* in the gallbladder is very difficult to eliminate. Up to now, the medical community has not found a suitable drug that can eliminate the bacteria in the gallbladder. At present, the only solution is to perform surgical gallbladder removal.</p>
<p>The prevention of typhoid fever can be carried out in three aspects: first, handling carriers; second, cutting off the transmission route; and third, enhancing personal resistance.</p>
<p>The method of handling carriers is to first find out the people who carry the bacteria, then explore the transmission parts of the carriers, and then give appropriate treatment. Carriers may be seemingly healthy people or patients. The transmission part may be the gallbladder, the intestinal tract, or the urinary system. Each patient who has recovered from typhoid fever should go through a fairly long observation period until it is definitively proven that they no longer carry the bacteria. This requires close cooperation between the patient's family and health workers.</p>
<p>The methods of cutting off the transmission route can be divided into: 1. Cook all food and drink thoroughly; 2. Exterminate flies; 3. Disinfect all objects and excreta that patients have come into contact with; 4. Meticulously disinfect the tap water supply; 5. Check whether chefs and workers are carriers.</p>
<p>The method of enhancing human resistance is to not only pay attention to personal hygiene on weekdays, but also to carry out preventive injections. The vaccine is killed *Salmonella typhi*. After being injected into subcutaneous tissue, it can cause the body to produce an antibody against *Salmonella typhi*. This antibody can help the human body to extinguish *Salmonella typhi* that has invaded the body. Preventive injections are usually given in three doses, with an interval of seven days between each dose. After the injection, the antibody concentration in the blood gradually increases. Only injecting once or twice, or the interval between two injections is too long, can affect antibody production. In areas where typhoid fever is prevalent, preventive injections should be given once a year.</p>
<p>In summary, we can say that the knowledge of the pathogenic bacteria of typhoid fever is already quite complete. In these aspects of the nature of the bacteria themselves, the mode of transmission, and the methods of prevention, bacteriologists and epidemiologists have done their best. Now the question is "action." How to extinguish the prevalence of typhoid fever is not only a matter of personal hygiene, but also the efforts of public health authorities, which are truly of great decisiveness.</p>
<h3 id="e155">The Pathogen and Vaccination of Typhoid Fever <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Jiamu</p>
<p>Typhoid fever is an acute infectious disease, also known as enteric fever, because lesions in the lymphatic tissue of the intestine cause systemic symptoms. In the past, Hippocrates, a giant in the Greek medical community, described this original disease. In the mid-18th century, this disease was classified as a group of typhoid diseases. Ancient Chinese medicine also has a "Treatise on Cold Damage Diseases," the meaning of which is roughly the same, all of which are old history in the development of medicine. By the 19th century, the disease was gradually separated and determined from other febrile and delusive diseases.</p>
<p>In 1880, Eberth found the pathogen of this disease—*Salmonella typhi*—in the spleen and mesenteric lymph nodes of a patient who died. At the same time, Robert Koch stained the material sections of the pathogen. Later, in 1884, Gaffky cultured *Salmonella typhi* on human culture medium and distinguished it clearly from other Gram-negative bacilli in the intestine. *Salmonella typhi* is a small bacillus 1-3n long and 0.5-0.8n wide. Gram staining is negative, no spores, motile, with eight to fourteen flagella all over the body, can grow on common culture media, is an aerobic and facultative anaerobic bacterium, can decompose glucose, maltose, and mannitol, etc. Dry sterilization takes one to two days, wet heat sterilization requires 55°C for one hour or 60°C for a quarter to twenty minutes, and can survive for months in clean water, in raw cold food, and even in ice.</p>
<p>This bacillus infects the human body and develops symptoms in one or two weeks. In the early stage of the illness, the bacteria are in the blood. After a week, the bacillus can be found in the patient's urine and stool.</p>
<p>Those who have had this disease and recovered have resistance to this disease in their bodies and are not easily infected with this disease again. This is called immunity. In 1908, Russel used this phenomenon for artificial immunization. That is, injecting a small amount of killed *Salmonella typhi* into the human body, so that they do not suffer from the disease but gain immunity to the disease. After multiple group tests and military use, the results were very good. To this day, we still use this method to prevent this disease. A qualified typhoid vaccine should be made from strains containing only Vi antigen. The correct injection method (three doses, the first time half a cc, the second and third times one cc each, with an interval of five to seven days between each time) can maintain the immunity obtained for two to three years. For the second immunization injection, intradermal injection can also be used, using a tenth of a cc of vaccine, injected intradermally once.</p>

<h3 id="e156">The Main Causes of Death from Typhoid Fever: Complications <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>— Xue Sishi</p>
<p>Complications share a similar meaning with the colloquial terms "病上病" (illness upon illness) or "轉病" (transformed illness). For example, the popular saying "轉痢　藥醫" (once dysentery transforms, no medicine can cure it), although not scientifically accurate, conveys the dangerous implication of "transformed illness," which echoes the serious medical understanding of complications.</p>
<p>During this summer season, typhoid fever is prevalent. Moreover, this year, at the beginning of summer, the number of patients is already significantly higher than in previous years, and the future death toll is bound to be alarming! If we investigate the causes of death from typhoid fever, complications account for the majority. This is because typhoid fever is highly susceptible to complications from various serious conditions. These complications can manifest in the affected small intestine or due to systemic poisoning caused by bacteria, etc. The occurrence of complications is most commonly seen in the second and third weeks of the illness. I will now list the subtle signs of each complication, selecting the most important ones, in order of their importance, for the reference of families with patients, to avoid unnecessary misfortunes!</p>
<p>(1) Intestinal Perforation</p>
<p>Intestinal perforation is one of the main causes of death from typhoid fever. It is more common in men than in women, but rare in children. This condition is most commonly seen in the third week of severely ill typhoid patients. The onset of subtle signs can be as rapid as thunder and lightning. The patient suddenly feels severe abdominal pain, most often in the lower right quadrant, followed by groaning. The body temperature drops, while the pulse and respiration increase. The patient constantly tosses and turns in bed, crying out in pain! The pallor of the face and the tense expression of pain often leave those attending the patient at a loss. In a short time, the severe abdominal pain may increase or decrease, after which the abdomen becomes distended like a drum, and the body temperature rises again. The patient is anxious, restless, covered in cold sweat, exhausted, and exhibits signs of collapse! At this time, if the family does not seek proper medical attention or delays due to seeking help from gods and ghosts, the patient will suffer from exhaustion, breath faintly, and soon pass away! In the early stages of the illness, in addition to the symptoms mentioned above, a physician's examination may reveal abdominal muscle rigidity and localized tenderness. Subsequently, the abdomen becomes distended with a large amount of gas, and there is widespread abdominal tenderness, indicating symptoms of acute peritonitis!</p>
<p>(2) Hemorrhage</p>
<p>Hemorrhage is also a serious complication of typhoid fever. Its level of danger is directly proportional to the amount of blood loss. It occurs in about seven or eight out of every hundred typhoid patients, and patients are mostly adults. Intestinal bleeding usually occurs in the early part of the third week of typhoid fever. If the bleeding is minor, there may be no other symptoms except for tarry black stools. However, with massive bleeding, the patient's temperature drops sharply, even below normal. The pulse becomes weak and rapid, blood pressure drops, respiration becomes shallow and rapid, the face becomes pale, and the extremities become cold and clammy. Blood tests show a decrease in hemoglobin. The patient is weak, anxious, and restless. In severe cases, the patient goes into shock. If appropriate treatment is not received, or if bleeding is continuous, the consequences are dire, and life or death is uncertain!</p>
<p>(3) Acute Cholecystitis</p>
<p>Cholecystitis is an important complication of typhoid fever, but it affects fewer patients, so it is not as emphasized as intestinal perforation and intestinal hemorrhage. Patients experience sudden pain in the upper right abdomen, sometimes with chills, vomiting, increased temperature, and rapid pulse. The abdominal pain is continuous and variable, but is mainly located in the upper right quadrant. It is very tender to the touch, and the abdominal muscles are rigid. Subsequently, jaundice becomes evident, making the diagnosis clear. If the symptoms continue to worsen, and there is a bulging in the upper right abdomen, then the gallbladder is extremely distended. If medical attention is not sought quickly, there is a risk of rupture and the development of peritonitis.</p>
<p>(4) Pneumonia</p>
<p>The complication of pneumonia during the course of typhoid fever is also a serious condition. It can be either bronchopneumonia or lobar pneumonia. The symptoms are not always consistent. Chills, shivering, increased temperature, severe chest pain, rapid breathing, tight chest, and coughing up rust-colored sputum are all common phenomena.</p>
<p>(5) Thrombosis</p>
<p>Thrombosis of the veins is not as serious as the above-mentioned complications, but it is also commonly seen. The most common site of involvement is the left femoral vein. Patients often feel swelling and pain on the inner side of the left groin or left leg during the recovery period, with limited movement. Upon palpation, a hard, cord-like mass can be felt under the skin, with slight tenderness. This is what is known as femoral vein thrombosis. Thrombosis itself is not serious, but if the area is bumped or massaged, a small piece of the thrombus can break off and travel through the bloodstream to the pulmonary artery, causing a pulmonary embolism that can be fatal.</p>
<p>(6) Other Complications</p>
<p>Other complications of typhoid fever, such as endocarditis, myocarditis, pericarditis, typhoid meningitis, parotitis, nephritis, cystitis, periostitis, osteomyelitis, otitis media, beriberi, confusion, etc., can also be found, but they are rare and do not need to be described in detail.</p>
<p>(7) Relapse</p>
<p>It is commonly said that a relapse of an illness is always more severe, but this is not the case with typhoid fever. Clinical experience shows that the symptoms are often milder and last for a shorter period of time. Relapses usually occur one to two weeks after the fever subsides, and at most three weeks. Therefore, patients should avoid strenuous activity or overeating during the recovery period, to avoid being hasty and not achieving the desired result.</p>
<p>In summary, I have briefly analyzed the main symptoms as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Sudden and persistent severe abdominal pain -- an important sign of intestinal perforation!</p>

<h3 id="e157">The Typhoid God: The Carrier <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>— Qiao Shumin</p>
<p>If there really is a "Typhoid God" in the world, then it is the "carrier."</p>
<p>Carriers, also known as "菌郵" (bacterial postmen), are people who carry certain pathogens in their bodies. They themselves show no symptoms of the disease but can transmit infectious diseases to others, harming others without benefiting themselves.</p>
<p>In nature, we have discovered more than 250 types of pathogenic microorganisms. Most of them cannot live independently or survive in the outside world for long, and need to seek shelter in humans or animals. The role of animals in storing and spreading bacteria will be discussed in a later issue. Today, let's first talk about the human aspect.</p>
<p>Pathogens entering the human body can cause disease under certain suitable conditions, which is a well-known fact. However, the severity of symptoms can vary greatly, like the light spectrum in physics, with different degrees of intensity. Severe cases can lead to death quickly; slightly severe cases cause suffering in bed; milder cases allow people to move freely outdoors; even milder cases may not be recognized by clinicians (Subclinical cases); and the mildest cases show no symptoms at all, known as "healthy carriers." From a treatment perspective, severe cases are important and require special care. However, from a prevention perspective, their importance is the opposite. Seriously ill patients are quarantined and confined to bed, limiting their opportunities to spread infectious diseases. Even if their movement is not greatly restricted, people know that they are ill and take precautions. However, carriers and extremely mild cases move freely without restriction, and others have no suspicion, often becoming the main source of spreading infectious diseases. Isn't it appropriate to call them "messengers of epidemics" or "Typhoid Gods?"</p>
<p>This issue focuses on introducing knowledge about typhoid fever. Please consider the following story of a "typhoid carrier" as an example.</p>
<p>In 1901, there was a female cook in the United States named Mary Mallon. She contracted typhoid fever and unfortunately recovered (unfortunate for others at that time, as you will see later). A month later, the laundress in that household also contracted typhoid fever. In 1902, Mary Mallon moved to another household to cook. Remarkably, within just two weeks, the laundress at the brothel also contracted typhoid fever. Subsequently, the family, one after another, had seven people infected with typhoid fever.</p>
<p>By 1904, she had moved to Long Island to work as a cook for a family. This household had a total of seven servants, four of whom contracted typhoid fever.</p>
<p>In 1906, she went to work for another family. This family had a total of eleven people, and within just one week, six of them were infected with typhoid fever. At this point, Mary Mallon was first suspected of having a tendency to spread the disease. So she simply changed employers again. Who knew that she had been gone for less than half a month and a laundering woman at a brothel had collapsed.</p>
<p>In 1907, she went to work in a New York family, and within two months, two more people were infected with typhoid fever. So, over these five years, she directly infected no fewer than twenty-six typhoid patients.</p>
<p>The New York City Department of Health detained Mary Mallon in a hospital on March 19, 1907, to prevent her from infecting others in society. For three years in the hospital, stool tests consistently showed high levels of typhoid bacilli. But she could not endure the loneliness in the hospital, and took advantage of the situation to escape, disappearing without a trace. Until 1914, she was spotted at Sloane Hospital for Women in New York, still working as a cook. In the spring of 1915, the hospital experienced a typhoid outbreak, with twenty-five cases, mainly among medical staff. Mary Mallon was strongly suspected, so she was granted leave to go out, never to return, changing her name to hide away. After much investigation by the Department of Health, she was finally detained again.</p>
<p>Subsequently, epidemiological investigations revealed that Mary Mallon had not only transmitted the above-mentioned illnesses, but had also transmitted others on many occasions; and that the 1903 typhoid fever epidemic in New York (a total of over 1,300 cases were caused by contaminated water) was also caused by this Mary Mallon.</p>
<p>"When the Typhoid God descends, people and animals suffer." There are countless carriers like Mary Mallon in China. Throughout the year, typhoid fever is rampant everywhere. How to ban and manage carriers requires wise officials; how to be careful in prevention depends on everyone. "Illness enters through the mouth," and so is typhoid!</p>

<h3 id="e158">Ancient Yangguan Melody <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Jingwen</p>
<p>A friend studying literature and history in England wrote recently, saying that he had seen a handwritten copy of the ancient Yangguan Melody in the British Museum, and he copied the verses of the handwritten copy in the letter.</p>
<p>In academic circles, this can be said to be a discovery of great value. According to my friend's letter, this Tang Dynasty manuscript originally came from the Dunhuang Grottoes and was obtained during Stein's archaeological expeditions in the Western Regions. We have long known that the remote Dunhuang is a famous holy place in the history of Eastern art. This Tang Dynasty manuscript was probably brought to the Western Regions by merchants or soldiers from the Tang and Song dynasties.</p>
<p>Wang Wei's Weicheng Melody, also known as Yangguan Melody, originally titled "Sending Yuan Er on a Mission to Anxi," was already widely popular in the Tang Dynasty and was a famous song widely sung by the people. Reading the original lyrics carefully, we only feel that the lyrics are sad and poignant, and the melody is lingering. It is a work of Wang Wei's entire life revealing his natural talent. At that time, the Tang Dynasty was prosperous, and customs were tolerant. Poets wrote each verse, and it immediately spread everywhere. Whether in public or private banquets, or in the houses of courtesans, they competed to sing it, creating a trend. Bai Juyi's Changqing Collection has a line that says, "The most pleasant is the song over the goblet, pearls strung together in song!" Song Qiude also said, "When Tang people bid farewell, they must sing the Yangguan Three Refrains." This shows the widespread popularity of the Yangguan Melody in the Tang Dynasty.</p>
<p>However, the so-called "three refrains" singing method seems to have been lost by the Song Dynasty. The popular singing method was no longer the "ancient tune." Su Shi's Dongpo Zhilin says: "The old tradition is the Yangguan Three Refrains, but in today's singing, each line is only repeated once. If the whole song is spoken of, it is repeated four times, which is not correct. When I was in Mizhou, a magistrate named Wen Xun said that he had obtained an ancient version of Yangguan, the sound of which was gentle, turning and sad, unlike what I had heard before. Each line is sung again, but the first line is not repeated, which shows that the Tang version of the three refrains was probably like this." This so-called repeating each line but not repeating the first line is very different from the Tang Dynasty manuscript in the British Museum. The Tang Dynasty manuscript is like this:</p>
<p>Weicheng is lightly raining in the morning, over and over again, the guest house is green with willow trees, so close. I urge you to drink one more cup of wine, leaving Yangguan, there will be no old friends. (First refrain)</p>
<p>Weicheng is lightly raining in the morning, the guest house is green with willow trees, so close. Willow trees so close, I urge you to drink one more cup of wine, leaving Yangguan, there will be no old friends. (Second refrain)</p>
<p>Weicheng is lightly raining in the morning, the guest house is green with willow trees, so close. I urge you to drink one more cup of wine, one more cup of wine poured down, leaving Yangguan, there will be no old friends. (Third refrain)</p>
<p>It can be seen that in the Tang Dynasty manuscript of the ancient Yangguan Melody, only the last three words of each of the first three lines are repeated, and the fourth line is not repeated. This is not only different from Su Shi's statement, but also different from the "continuous three refrains" and "string of pearls three refrains" mentioned in Tian Yiheng's Yin Guan Three Refrains. Furthermore, all we know now is the three refrains singing method, and there is no way to verify the "musical score" of the ancient version. The singing of the Yangguan Melody in the Tang Dynasty was probably accompanied by the pipa, which can be proved by the ancient poems that say: "Parents need to sell their daughter's body lightly, one pipa song travels ten thousand miles; playing to Yangguan, they all clap their hands, they don't know that it is a song of broken heart!"</p>
<p>The ancient Yangguan Melody was accompanied by the pipa, and the pipa score seems to have been lost. This reminds me that in the summer of 1927, I happened to be at Tsinghua University in Peiping and mentioned the problem of the score of Yangguan Three Refrains to my teacher Liang Qichao. At that time, Mr. Liang Qichao had the idea of asking Zhao Yuanren to compose a new song. Later, because Mr. Wang Guowei committed suicide, Mr. Liang Qichao hurriedly left the school, and the Shui Mu Tsinghua was covered in a deep layer of sorrow, and Mr. Yuanren never completed this song. Thinking of it now, I can't help but feel lost!</p>

<p>— Ying Feicun</p>
<p>Beside the pillow, a quiet, reflective voice:</p>
<p>"I think it's better to go out. It's not like living in the countryside before, where people always said you had high ambitions and a strong backbone, refusing to eat the Japanese' food. Now that we've won, if you keep waiting, what will people think? There must be a friend or two outside you can rely on."</p>
<p>"Yeah, I've wanted to leave for a long time."</p>
<p>The decision to leave has been made. The wife squats on the floor in front of the bed, packing the suitcase. The husband holds the youngest daughter, watching the two older sons play with flashcards.</p>
<p>The wife, as always, in a quiet, reflective voice:</p>
<p>"I've mended all your socks. I don't know how you wear your socks. They're always torn at the toes. You're such a big man, you should know to trim your toenails when they get long."</p>
<p>He turns to look down at her. She also looks up at him with a reproachful glance. As their eyes meet, the reproachful look in her long eyelashes immediately turns into a slight smile. He smiles too.</p>
<p>"What are you smiling at?" she asks.</p>
<p>"What are you smiling at?" he asks.</p>
<p>"I'm smiling at you: 'Lazy, your toenails are like shovels.'"</p>
<p>"I'm smiling at you, so busy preparing for my departure, but I—"</p>
<p>"But what?"</p>
<p>"I don't even know where the travel expenses are coming from."</p>
<p>The wife lowers her head and sighs: her husband's response.</p>
<p>"How much money do you need to get to Shanghai from home?"</p>
<p>"How much? Five thousand to Zhoushan, about five thousand from Zhoushan to Ningbo, and more than ten thousand for a deck ticket from Ningbo to Shanghai, plus food and transportation expenses. It'll cost at least forty thousand in total."</p>
<p>"Forty thousand?" The wife's eyes widen.</p>
<p>After a moment of silence, she says as if she has found a solution: "Oh, we're still short ten thousand."</p>
<p>"It's really not easy to leave. Even if I can leave, what about the family?"</p>
<p>"Don't worry about that. I bought a half-stone of rice the other day. That should be enough for the four of us for two or three months. For vegetables, I've pickled a few salted yellow croakers. That shouldn't be a problem either. School will start in half a month. The salary should be enough to make ends meet. I'm just worried that you're still short ten thousand yuan, and I don't know if you'll have a job or not when you get to Shanghai."</p>
<p>Suddenly—</p>
<p>"A'Han, oh, Miss Zheng." A booming voice accompanies a tall man as he enters the door.</p>
<p>The housewife quickly stands up. The couple, all four eyes staring at the visitor.</p>
<p>"Oh, who is it? It's Mr. Wang."</p>
<p>"Oh, Brother Zikang. I didn't expect it to be you! How did you come to be here?"</p>
<p>"I'm in Shanghai, handling the wholesale of dyed clothing to Haimen. It's really a coincidence, the wind direction is wrong, and the sailboat is docked here. I knew you lived here, so I made a special trip ashore to see you. As soon as the wind turns south, I'll have to go back to the ship. How are you? A'Han, you've been a recluse here for four years, it's time for you to go out and get active."</p>
<p>"Yes, Mr. Wang, he's preparing to go to Shanghai the day after tomorrow. Look, I'm packing his luggage for him."</p>
<p>"You have a few little babies now? Are these all of them?"</p>
<p>"Three." The husband replies, "Brother Zikang, it's still you, capable both in the pen and on the battlefield, always making money in business."</p>
<p>"It's definitely better than teaching. You should have listened to me and changed professions a long time ago."</p>
<p>"Doing business is at the mercy of the wind and waves, it's quite hard work." The wife interjects, as she pours tea for the guest.</p>
<p>"I actually enjoy this kind of life. How old are the three little babies?"</p>
<p>The wife says, "The oldest is only six, the second is five, and the one I'm holding is only two. A'Mang, A'Chao, say hello to your uncle."</p>
<p>The children shyly say, "Uncle." So quietly that they can hardly hear themselves.</p>
<p>"Good, good, be good, A'Han, you have a house full of children, you're very lucky. If I were you, Miss Zheng, no offense, three is enough. You have to have capital controls from now on, haha. Come, let uncle hold you." The big man snatches the girl from his friend's arms. "Be good, be good, smile for uncle, good." He holds the child in his left arm, and pulls out a few bills from his long pocket with his right hand. "Here, two bills each, uncle will give you money to buy candy."</p>
<p>The couple say in unison, "What are you doing?" The father wants to snatch the money back from the children's hands, but the children are holding it tighter than any treasure. The big man waves his hand, "It's not for you, why are you being so polite?"</p>
<p>After that, they talked with emotion about each other's recent situations after their separation and about friends related to each other. Looking at the sky outside, the friend says: the wind direction will probably change soon, and the ship will leave at any time, and he is relieved to see them. He must go now. No matter how hard they try to keep him, a chorus of "goodbyes" accompanies the tall man as he leaves.</p>
<p>"Mommy, Mommy, that uncle gave me four thousand yuan." The eldest child proudly holds up the bill in front of his mother.</p>
<p>"I also got four thousand," the second son also says rather proudly.</p>
<p>"Baby got four thousand too." The little girl refers to herself as baby, her pronunciation is unclear, and a small round face breaks into a smile.</p>
<p>The husband sighs: "Even children are so materialistic these days."</p>
<p>"Come," the mother takes the eldest child's hand, "You are all good children, give the money to Mommy."</p>
<p>"Um, I want to buy a ball." The eldest says, hiding the hand holding the money behind his back, tilting his head.</p>
<p>"I want to buy scallion candy." The second one is greedy.</p>
<p>The mother coaxes them: "Daddy is going to Shanghai tomorrow, we'll let Daddy take the money and buy you little leather shoes, little leather shoes are so pretty."</p>
<p>"Good, good, little leather shoes, little leather shoes!" The two brothers believe it's true, and are overjoyed.</p>
<p>"Baby wants little leather shoes too." The little daughter points to the broken cloth shoes on her feet: "Want good ones."</p>
<p>"Okay, one pair each, two pairs in total. Daddy, don't forget. Now, you all give the money to Mommy."</p>
<p>The three children immediately rush to present their only private property to their mother like a "donation."</p>
<p>That night, the wife slips a bundle of bills into her husband's suit pocket. She smiles and looks at her husband sideways and says, "When you get a job and earn a salary, don't forget the kids' little leather shoes."</p>
<p>The husband looks at the gold ring that is missing from his wife's ring finger, and then looks at the three children's sweet smiles in their dreams, and his eyes turn red. …</p>

<h3 id="e161">The Dynamic Trends of Our Nation's Music Scene <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>— Contribution</p>
<p>Amidst the post-recovery atmosphere, the dynamic trends of our nation's music scene are a concern of the new cultural sphere. I present here a brief report on the findings of my investigation:</p>
<p>Regarding organizations, the National Conservatory of Music (originally located in Qingmuguan, Chongqing) has begun its eastward relocation. As the highest music institution in our country, it is supposed to be located in the capital as a matter of principle. However, it has not been easy to find suitable premises in Nanjing, so it has been decided to temporarily move to Changzhou, using the former Japanese school there as its premises. Dean Wu Bochao and some of the teaching staff have already embarked on a boat to Shanghai and are currently en route; another group of students is traveling by road via Xi'an and should arrive in Changzhou soon.</p>
<p>In addition to the National Conservatory of Music, Chongqing also has a National Music Branch School, headed by Dai Cuilun. After the victory, this branch school was renamed the National Shanghai Conservatory of Music and is scheduled to move to Shanghai during the summer vacation. The former Shanghai National Conservatory of Music's school building in the city center is currently occupied by a Japanese garrison, and the interior has been heavily damaged. Whether the basic structure can be repaired and used is still a question.</p>
<p>The third branch of the Shanghai Temporary University Preparatory Class (i.e., the Music Class) is nearing completion of its studies and will conclude next month. After the completion, qualified students from this class will be admitted to various national music schools.</p>
<p>The National Fujian Conservatory of Music was originally located in Yong'an, with Tang Xue as the principal. After the victory, the school moved to Fuzhou and is temporarily located in Jianxing Village outside the East Gate. It is reported that the school's building construction fees have been approved by the Ministry of Education, and land has been acquired within the city of Fuzhou for construction.</p>
<p>The Northwest Conservatory of Music was originally in Xi'an and was established during the Anti-Japanese War, headed by Zhao Meibo. It is reported that the school plans to move to Beiping and be renamed as national; Zhao has already arrived in Beiping to prepare everything.</p>
<p>The private Shanghai Conservatory of Music has been established for eight years, headed by Ding Shande, Chen De, and Chen Youxin. Their spirit is commendable and has been praised by society. After the victory, it was announced that the school was closing down due to internal disagreements. All who knew this felt regret. It is heard that there might be a possibility of reopening in the near future.</p>
<p>Realizing the necessity of unity, the Shanghai music community has organized the Shanghai Musicians Association, with Ma Sicong publicly elected as the chairman, and Chen Hong, Ding Shande, Cao Shijun, Yu Xinru, Li Delun, Xu Jinqing, etc., as standing directors. The association has already organized several concerts, and its address is located at No. 31 Ma Sinan Road.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Government Orchestra was formerly the Shanghai Municipal Council Orchestra, with a history of over forty years. It has more than sixty members, and its performance record is the best in the Far East. At one point, it was on the verge of shutdown due to financial difficulties. It is heard that the current director of the orchestra, Xie Xi'en, has been trying to persuade the municipal authorities to increase funding and continue operating it.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Music Magazine Society was organized by Chen Hong, Ding Shande, etc., with the aim of publishing the "Music Magazine" monthly. The magazine has been advertised for a while, but it has not yet been published. It is understood that it is still in the proofreading stage. The format is 16mo, with over forty pages, including musical scores in addition to text.</p>
<p>The Shanghai branch of the Poetry and Music Association has a music group, which is overseen by Ma Sicong and Chen Yuan.</p>
<p>The Nanjing Lizhi Society has established an orchestra and is recruiting many members in Shanghai. It has already begun its performance work, headed by Zhu Chongzhi.</p>
<p>The Chongqing China Symphony Orchestra plans to move to Nanjing.</p>
<p>On the personal front, Ma Sicong will be going to Guangdong in the coming days and, after a short stay, will come to Shanghai again.</p>
<p>Wu Bochao is en route to Shanghai, while Dai Cuilun, Chen Tianhe, Jiang Dingxian, Zhang Yan, Lao Jingjian, Man Fumin, Shi Yigui, and others are all in Chongqing waiting for a boat to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Those who have already arrived in Shanghai include Ren Zhengqian, Han Zhongjie, Ma Sijing, Ma Siju, Liao Fushu, Huang Muli, Ma Guolin, Guan Yixuan, etc.</p>
<p>Pianist Li Huifang has gone to the United States for further studies. It is reported that soprano Lang Yuxiu will also be going to the United States.</p>
<p>In the past two months, Shanghai has seen an unprecedented number of musical performances. These include Situ Huacheng's violin recital, Yun Min's vocal concert, Chen Zhengping's piano recital, and Qi Jun and Xu Mianqing's joint vocal concert at the YMCA. At the Lyceum Theatre, there was Ma Sicong's composition concert (two days), the Musicians Association's joint concert (two days), Li Yingzhi's vocal concert, and the collaborative performance between Ma Sihong and Dong Guangguang organized by Jiaoxing.</p>
<p>Pianist Wu Lezhong, who has been absent from the stage for a long time, is rumored to be considering giving a solo recital due to the encouragement of relatives and friends. Looking at the above, it can be seen that musicians will gather in Shanghai after the war, and the Shanghai-Nanjing area will inevitably become the center of Chinese music.</p>
<h3 id="e162">Art and Freaks <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>— Zhongyuan</p>
<p>I live with a woman who is constantly pregnant. When her ten months were up and the time came for her to give birth, I was filled with joy, thinking I would see a snow-white, chubby baby. Unexpectedly, with a cry of "Ah!", the pregnant woman birthed a strange thing that was headless, limbless, and shaped like a stone. I was greatly disappointed and sighed repeatedly.</p>
<p>The "freaks" of art are almost the same situation.</p>
<p>Some people wonder why artists are generally compared to women in labor? Of course, the creation of a work of art must go through a considerable period of gestation. However, a beautiful rose, from bud to bloom, must also go through a considerable period of gestation. So, why not compare artists to more lovely rose bushes?</p>
<p>I think the key lies here: A rose plucked from the tree, after leaving its mother plant, immediately withers and fades. But an infant, after being born, will cry and laugh, and continue to grow.</p>
<p>Therefore, the necessary condition for a work of art is two words: life! In other words, anything that has life, even if its appearance is not good, or even if it is missing an eye or has an extra finger, is still an artistic infant. On the other hand, something that has no life, like a stone, even if it has a beautiful appearance and complete limbs, can only be called a "freak."</p>
<h3 id="e163">A Chronicle of Depression (1) <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>— Hu Shanhu</p>
<p>This article is a sincere account by Hu Shanhu of the current state of culture. Entitled "A Chronicle of Depression", it is divided into five chapters: "The Depression of the Reader", "The Depression of the Writer", "The Depression of the Editor", "The Depression of the Publisher", and "The Depression of the Environment". The reasoning is thorough, the analysis is rigorous, and it can serve as a reference for cultural workers. It will be published sequentially in this journal.</p>
<p>Editor</p>
<p>The Depression of the Reader</p>
<p>All reading material is spiritual nourishment for people. Spiritual hunger is probably even more difficult to endure than physical hunger. During the eight years of occupation, we suffered spiritual hunger because, under the control of the enemy and puppets, there was no beneficial spiritual nourishment. Drinking poison to quench thirst is, after all, done by a minority. Those who know it is poison and are willing to drink it should correct themselves. That is to say, those who are spiritually hungry should have proper nourishment. Unexpectedly, in the past year, the reality has not been like that.</p>
<p>Looking back at the publishing industry in the past year, we can see the lack of such nourishment. What books have the major publishing houses, which rank first in the country, published? None! Some are just a few books transported from the rear, which are either outdated or thin and basic, not worth chewing on. If the major publishing houses are like this, the smaller ones are even worse. Some have closed, some have changed their businesses, and others are selling stationery or other colorful things to maintain their business. The magazine world seems livelier. However, a large part of them are yellow publications, which have become poison and are not enough to serve as spiritual nourishment. Those that are not yellow can be divided into two categories: one is propaganda, with distorted theories and distorted records, not worth looking at, and even poison is not worth hearing. The other is commercial products, which, although they are not yet yellow, and even have some works that can become legitimate nourishment, are ultimately aimed at commerce, that is, aimed at making money. When people eat them, they will not be completely beneficial to the body and mind. If you are not careful, you will inevitably mix in some poisonous ingredients. Of course, there are those that fully meet the standards, but they have become as rare as phoenix feathers, and are greatly insufficient! Looking at the newspapers, who knows what today's newspapers are like: propaganda comes first, and entertainment comes first. Those that pay attention to the spiritual needs of the readers are also a small minority. At the same time, those who read newspapers may only want to know some news and do not want to find spiritual nourishment in them. Thus, newspapers are disconnected from the people's spirit. There are a few supplements that may not be for propaganda or entertainment purposes, but still, like magazines, how many are there after all? They are as few as the stars in the sky!</p>
<p>We readers are now in an extremely depressed state! We are spiritually hungry, and we want nourishment. But we can't find anything to eat. We don't want to eat poison, and we don't want others to eat poison. But what can we do? When will our hunger end?</p>
<p>Who should we blame? First, we should blame the writers, why they, with their writing skills and convenience, do not give us proper spiritual nourishment! They are not unaware of what is proper and what is improper, but they have obliterated their conscience and desperately turned black and white upside down, making propaganda recklessly, or simply seeking to deceive manuscript fees, only seeking that the manuscripts have sales, while neglecting the mission that a writer should have. They are scum, thieves of the cultural world, and we want to denounce them! To drive them out! We want them to wash their minds and produce proper spiritual nourishment!</p>
<p>The readers' depression is entirely the responsibility of the writers!</p>

<p>— Zhao Qingge</p>
<p>Last night, Lihua thought about going on stage to sing with great composure. She treated going on stage to sing as if she were dealing with a daily required course. She felt there was no difference.</p>
<p>Today, Lihua's life began to enter a new stage.</p>
<p>Zhang Xian held Lihua's hand in one hand and Liyun's hand in the other, and entered the backstage of the theater. Mrs. Mo and Second Mrs. Weng carried their "stage costumes" bags and followed behind them. The people backstage who knew Zhang Xian all nodded and greeted him. Some even congratulated him, saying, "Xianzi" (Zhang Xian's nickname is Xianzi, which also refers to the strings of a huqin), you should be busy!" Zhang Xian just kept smiling with squinting eyes. Right at the corner of the room where Shi Yulou was putting on makeup, a small table was set up for the two sisters to sit and laugh. While calling people to bring water for washing their faces, he himself was busy placing things on the table for them.</p>
<p>The backstage was in a complete mess, with men and women, crowded together, "chirping and chattering," all looking three parts human and seven parts ghost, none of them were well-dressed or handsome. Adding to this was the dimness of the room, under the dim light, the colorful painted faces flickered, and they were holding guns and knives, which really made people feel uneasy!</p>
<p>"What is this place? The rooms are not rooms, with pieces of wood here and pieces of wood there, separated into several small pigeon coops. The people are not people. Strange shapes and strange voices." Lihua thought, looking at this unfamiliar environment, feeling very annoyed and afraid! But, even if it is hell on earth, Mrs. Mo has brought her here, and she has no choice but to stay down! Stay down! So, she simply closed her eyes and stopped looking at everything. Letting Zhang Xian play with her, like playing with a small wooden puppet, a small puppet.</p>
<p>Liyun was not as sensitive as Lihua. She liked to look at everything and ask about everything. She felt a novel interest in everything that happened. When Zhang Xian was helping her with her makeup, she happily gazed at herself. She felt that her appearance had completely changed, and even she herself was amusing.</p>
<p>The gongs and drums on the stage sounded. This is called "naotai" (noisy stage). After that, it was the opening performance of the troupe. After the opening performance, it was time for Liyun's "Catching and Releasing Cao" to take the stage. Zhang Xian first instructed her on the side, and then rushed to the front stage to play the huqin for her.</p>
<p>Liyun stepped onto the stage without being approached. But when she saw the black mass of people sitting in the pit under the stage, she couldn't help but panic! "The scene" (the accompaniment orchestra of Peking opera is called "scene") repeated twice, and Zhang Xian stamped his feet anxiously and glared his eyes. After a long while, Liyun slowly calmed down and opened her mouth, but she had unknowingly forgotten several lines. But she managed to sing it down. Backstage, she quickly told Lihua, saying, "The black mass of people in the pit are looking at me, it's so scary! It scared me so much that I forgot all the lyrics."</p>
<p>Lihua showed no expression after hearing this. She seemed to have "a well-thought-out plan."</p>
<p>Zhang Xian rushed to the backstage again, introduced the person who played Emperor Zhengde in the "You Long Xi Feng" (Playing Phoenix in the Dragon's Presence) to Lihua, and instructed that person to take good care of her and help her with some of the lyrics when necessary. Zhang Xian was relatively particularly concerned about Lihua's performance on stage because he had great hopes for Lihua.</p>
