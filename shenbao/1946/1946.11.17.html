<p>〔本報南京十六日電〕政協秘長當震，十五日午後飛滬，與張君勱，李璜，張羣等有所商洽，並於十六日下午四時半返京。晚間，雷接見記者時，對滬行任務未說明，僅答覆記者如次之詢問：（一）國府委員會即將改組，目前正籌備中，共產黨與民盟之府委名額，仍予保留。（二）外傳改組後之政府將設十八部一說，不確。（三）政院改組一事，以時間問題，國大閉幕後自將辦理。</p>
<p>〔合衆社南京十六日電〕和談政府首席代表邵力子，今日告合衆社記者云：民主社會黨參加國大已無問題。邵氏稱：民社黨領袖張君勱赴滬與其黨內人士討論後，業已返抵南京，並在參加國大前，提出四項建議，要求政府接受。據邵氏稱：此等建議包括下列數點：（一）政府重申以和平方式解決共產黨問題之政策；（二）政府應准許充份實現公民自由，包括言論，出版與集會結社自由在內；（三）政府應自一切學校中撤去黨部及靑年團之活動。邵氏云：此等建議對於政府係「可以同意」者，其實施細則正在擬定中。此項問題預料當能早日解決。邵氏並透露：政府準備改組，國府會議及行政院均在內，此項改組將在國大開會期間實行。又吳鐵城氏亦稱：國民黨準備改組政府。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十六日電〕張羣十六日晨七時一刻乘京滬車抵京，同行者有鄂國大代表孟憲章等七人，因張氏抵達時間甚早，往迎者極少，下車後即乘吳鐵城氏轎車赴吳寓，十時吳鼎昌往訪，旋晋謁主席，繼再訪宋子文，下午四時李宗仁往訪，五時應張嘉璈之邀，至天竺路與張君勱會見，並晤談一切，晚應馬特使之邀，前往晚餐。外傳張有調職文官長說，雖未得官方證實，惟頗有可能。</p>

<p>〔本報南京十六日電〕靑年黨國大代表名單，十六日晨公布後，曾琦，陳啓天，左舜生等十九人，十六日已往報到，李璜因病留滬，十七日可返京。又國大代表十六日報到卅人，連前共一四四五人，其中靑年黨代表十九人</p>
<p>〔中央社南京十六日電〕記者以靑年黨領袖左舜生談話詢問彭部長學沛之意見，承答：左先生之談話，邏輯謹嚴，其謂唯一致參加國大，始能維持和平，促進統一，製成舉國支持之憲法，以保障民生，其理論實屬簡單而明顯，足見是非與公道究非恫嚇與宣傳策略所能掩蓋也。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十六日電〕民主社會黨領袖張君勱偕該黨黨負蔣勻田·孫寳剛等九人，十六日下午四時半自滬飛抵京，聞民社黨名單早經擬就，即可提出，國府可能即日召開遴選委員會，予以通過。記者今晚曾以靑年黨·民社黨之參加國大詢民盟感想，羅隆基答，無何意見表示，惟日內擬招待記者，發表態度，藍家莊門前已冷落矣。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕民主社會黨領袖張君勱，於十五日晨再度來滬，十五十六兩日上午，繼續在此間與該黨幹部舉行會議，討論參加國大及該黨今後問題。商討結果，該黨對於國大名單，希望政府當局接受所提要求後，立即提出。張氏下午即乘飛機返京。</p>
<p>記者昨晚往訪該黨發言人孫寳毅，據稱：「本黨尙未提出國大代表名單，希望政府能與中共繼續商談，使目前局勢不至更形惡化」。又稱：「該黨在未提名單前所要求國大延期及依照政治協商會議決議實行，其中關於國大延期，目前已成過去。但對改組政府及制憲部分，仍望政府予以接受。憲草中有若干重要條款，如行政院應對立法院負責，及政院職權範圍等，現均尙未決定，希望政府採納」。</p>
<p>孫氏並表示民盟與民社之關係素甚密切，民盟所有議案，均經民社黨共同決定，但民社黨行動，向不受民盟約束。民社始終期望與民盟採取一致行動，相互呼應。然在特殊情形下，民社亦可自由行動，不受民盟約束。民盟黃炎培近由京返滬，沈鈞儒亦繼來，但羅隆基則尙留京。</p>
<p>中共當局最近對於民社黨並未作何表示，張君勱氏此去，或將與周恩來氏洽談。周氏因飛機躭擱，尙未返延安，但董必武仍留京，造成藕斷絲連狀態，大局前途想仍有轉機。</p>

<p>〔中央社本市訊〕中國勞動協會爲擁護召開國大，反對共黨稱兵割據，特電南京國大代表稱：此次政府忍讓爲國，頒布停戰命令，並一再展緩會期，苦心孤詣，舉世共察。本會爲全國性之勞工組織，成立以還，十有餘年，以根據三民主義硏究勞工理論，協謀勞工福利，促進勞工運動爲宗旨。抗戰軍興，復參加軍事工作協助政府今後自當一本初衷以實現三民主義之勞工政策，聯絡國際工友，繼續爲提高勞工文化，增進勞工福利而努力。共產主義不適應於中國國情，已瞭然於國父遺敎中，而共產黨卑劣殘暴，不民主之作風，尤不適於愛好和平自由之中華民族，吾人認定今日之中國，必須實行憲政，而憲政之實施，必須頒布憲法，頒布憲法，必須召開國民大會，欲求國家之和平建設，必須軍隊國家化，共產黨擁兵割據之局面，實屬和平統一之一大障碍。蓋軍隊一日不國家化，則戰亂相導，永無寗日，吾人當此國家民族成敗興寂之際，必須通力合作，向建國途徑勇往邁進，臻國家於富强康樂之境，登斯民於袵席之上，倘再有任何黨派不顧民生之疾苦與國家民族之利益，而甘冒天下之大不韙，破壞國民大會，稱兵作亂者，定爲全國人民之公敵。欣逢大會開幕之時，謹向代表諸公掬誠電達，幸昭鑒之，中國勞動協會叩，十五日。</p>

<h3 id="c9">周恩來書面聲明 <a href="#c9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>〔本報南京十六日電〕中共代表團周恩來，十六日下午二時半，舉行記者招待會，發表書面聲明，表示除此外無其他可說明者。繼由記者提出問題，由周一一作答，至下午四時許始散。其書面聲明全文如次：國民黨政府一手包辦的國民大會，已於昨天開幕了，這一國大是違背政協決議與全國民意，而由一黨政府單獨召開的，中國共產黨堅決反對，不但這一國大的開會日期未經政協協議，更重要的它是一黨召開的分裂的國大，而不是各黨派參加的團結的國大。政協協議的國大依照政協決議及其程序與精神，必須政協決議次第付諸實施之後，在改組的政府領導之下，而能召開。</p>
<p>政協各項決試，是各黨派協議的臨時大憲章，是一個整體而不可分割的，十個月來，政協決議不但未曾絲毫付諸實施，而且已被國民黨當局破壞無遺。停戰協定是經過政協決議批准的，但內戰從東北大打到關內，政府當局已澈底破壞了一月間停戰令的位軍，政府當局在政協開幕時，所宣佈的四項諾言，從敎塲口大打直到李聞暗殺案，已被國民黨特務統治破壞得一乾二淨，政府改組迄未協議成功，和平建國綱領遂亦無從實行，而對許多解放區的地方政府，國民黨當局不僅不許其依照綱領，規定維持現狀，且欲實行「接收」，不允則實行武力佔領，軍事決議的基本精神，是軍民分治，但現在國民黨政府的各省主席，無不以現役軍人充當。</p>
<p>憲草審議在重慶旣未完工，共產黨代表當即有全部保留聲明，到南京後，政府當局更將其一擱至今，從未再議，國大問題的協議，是政協開會期中一個最後妥協，國民黨當局保證不開一黨包辦的分裂的國大，並保證通過政協審議完成的憲草，其他黨派方允許十年年一黨包辦的代表，得保留在區域與職業的代表名額之中，且必須增加的黨派代表風解放區代表，在內戰完全停止，政協決議已付諸實施，人民自由權利已獲保障，及政府改組之後能多到會，這樣的國大，方能稱是各黨派參加的團結的國大。</p>
<p>現在開幕的所謂國大，不只違背上述決議及其精神，便連開會日期或延期，也均由一黨政府決定代表名額。據十一月十五日上午已公佈者，竟達一五八〇人，在原協議二〇五〇人中，已侵佔其他黨派四一〇人，尤其是解放區二〇〇人代表名額，至一四〇人之多，可見道一國大是澈頭澈尾一黨包辦的分裂的國大。所謂空出名額等待中共參加，旣係破壞政協，又屬完全騙局。實際上只是想騙取中共以外的其他黨派參加，以粉飾國民黨當局個人獨裁的面目而已。故一月來南京商談，經第三方面人士的辛勤努力，中共方面曾不斷提議，商談形式，可以不拘，但必須依照政協決議及其程序辦事，惟均被政府當局拒絕。一黨國大的會期愈近，我們愈主張立即停開，一黨國大方有可能使軍事三人會議，政協綜合小組及憲草審議委會得以同時開議。</p>
<p>根據停戰協定整軍方案與政協決議，分別解決當前的軍事政治問題並立付實施。然後方能在和平的環境中，從容召開各黨派參加的團結的國大。但急於粉飾獨裁的政府，當局對此根本不予考慮。現在開幕的一黨國大，不但使中共及第三方面最近在商談中的主張成爲不可能，並且最後破壞了政協以來的一切決議及停戰協定與整軍方案，隔斷了政協以來和平商談的道路，同時也很快的澈底揭穿了政府當局十一月八日「停戰令」的欺騙性。這一黨國大還要通過所謂「憲法」把獨裁「合法」化，把停戰「合法」化，照這樣做下去，中國人民一定要陷入苦痛的深淵。我們中國共產黨人，堅決不承認這個國大，和談之門已爲國民黨政府當局一手關閉了。一黨國大中將要玩的一切把戲，乃至改組政府，我們決無一顧之必要。參加了這一國大，承認了這些把戲，就必然推翻了政協決議，破壞了政協以來和平民主團結統一的軌道，中間的道路是沒有的。進攻解放區的血戰方殷，美國政府援蔣內戰的政策依然未變，假和平假民主絕對騙不了人，我們中國共產黨，願同中國人民及一切眞正爲民主而努力的黨派，爲眞和平眞民主奮鬥到底。</p>

<p>董必武仍將留京</p>
<p>〔本報南京十六日電〕周恩來十六日二時在記者招待會中，答記者問：一·返延之行，二三日決定，十餘人同行，何時再來，尙未考慮及之。此次返延人員，乃因過去政協會議而來者。董必武則仍留京，因辦事處係抗戰開始即已設立者，同時留京仍與政府保持聯絡接觸，上海辦事處亦仍存在。平軍調部在葉劍英領導下有十餘人仍存在。二·國大召開，解放區是否召開人民大會，現尙未考慮。三·目前政府軍隊正向延安作更緊之進攻，胡宗南部調集十旅，在延安南部佈置進攻，馬鴻逵亦有五個旅自黃河西至黃河之東。政府下停戰令之次日，延安上空曾有十四架飛機盤旋，即與馬特使等進行軍事商談時，亦有飛機二架過延安上空。此實說明政府仍欲以軍事行動威脅共產黨參加國大，但共產黨決不屈服。政府之次一行動，可能即向延安進行試探性的軍事進攻行動，我可預計，政府決心向延安地區進寫，是說朋政府不但產生一黨召開包辦之國大，且準備用進攻延安地區的進攻，阻塞了將來的商談。政府以百分之六十六的軍力，在解放區，正是全國進攻的局面，蘇北方面，政府正進攻鹽城，佈置漣水·溧陽·繼續進行山東半島烟台背後進攻。平漢綫上政府軍，正沿綫向二側行動，東北安東遼北地區，亦有軍事行動，實際軍事行動從未停止。四，靑年黨名單之提出，乃是早在意料之中者。五，共產黨對第三方面建議國大延期事，認爲係不智之舉，政府亦不見得採納，而提名向政府作質，自己先破壞政協決議及精神。共產黨四代表十一日在交行會痛切陳詞，說明意在維護政協立塲，如政府亦能維護固屬甚好，不幸國大已召開，不啻撕毀政協決議。靑年黨同樣撕破，當表示遺憾。六，共產黨今後態度：（一）中共今後方針，是從日本投降即已確定，求和平團結統一之中國，此態度始終不變；（二）辦法需就客觀情况之發展而定，目前應回去討論；（三）照政協決議精神，中共曾作極大妥協，十年前之國家，許多人都反對，政協已有若干部份妥協，如憲草，停戰協定，四項諾言，和平建國綱領，及政府方面之協議。（四）對國大問題，政府希望十年前代表保留，中共以爲國大只保證修改憲草原則，可保證通過國大，同時政協決議可實施政府改組，然後召開國大，此始爲各黨派團結參加之國大。（五）此次實爲政府片面的召開，中共絕對不參加，抗戰前十年內戰，抗戰後八年磨擦，勝利後一年糾紛，二十年於茲矣。（六）延安歡迎中央日報　　中央社前往，但始終無人去。（七）政府召開國大即表示破裂，故我要回去。（八）中共不放棄和談，在新的基礎下，將恢復商談。（九）政府如欲繼續進攻，吾人當然堅決抵抗。</p>

<p>國大召開之日，社會賢達旣多報到出席，靑年黨且提出參加國大之名單，其宣傳部部長左舜生氏，更就此事，發表書面談話，對該黨參加國大之經過及理由，有所闡述，而歸結於「功罪是非，見仁見智，一切惟有聽諸當代賢豪及後世史家之公斷。」這種政治家坦白之風度，實在値得國人的讚佩。國民大會的召開，原在爲中國之和平統，一以及民主建設樹立萬世之基，爲國家制定根本大法，此項具有歷史意義的會議，其成就如何，端在當前國內各黨派及無黨派人士，對之是否表示衷誠的合作。政府爲召開國大，不惜以極度忍讓寬容爲懷者，原冀各黨各派及無黨無派人士得能共同參加，討論國是，爲國家的長治久安制定完善的憲法，所以儘量容納各方意見，不惜再番延期。原定國父誕辰召開之國大，終因調停方面人士之奔走斡旋，而再予展期三日；可見政府忍讓爲國，達於頂點。三日期滿，我們於國大揭幕之日，而看見有社會賢達人士的出席，靑年黨名單的提出，對於大局的前途，頓覺無限的光明。</p>
<p>何以言之？當今國民黨執政的政府，本革命的三民主義，原期早日得以實施憲政，還政於民。國民大會的召開，爲實施憲政的初階，期於制定憲法以後，頒行全國，從此使國家步入憲政的常軌。爲了和平統一民主建設，政府一再尊重各力意見，爲極度的忍讓，凡此事實，國人咸知。各黨各派如果有和平統一民主建設之誠意，便應該一致參加國大，共謀國事。誠如靑年黨發言人所云：「吾人則認停戰旣已實行，惟一致參加國大，和平始有繼續維持之希望：惟有一致參加國大，始有促進全國統一之可能…惟有將政協改訂之憲草，在本屆國大通過，獲得舉國一致之支持，民主始能獲得一有力之保障。」凡此所言，實足以代表國人一般之意向。國民大會旣在各方要求之下面一再延期，則延期揭慕之國大，自應由各方一致參加。全國人民所望於國大者至殷，則國大之拒不參加，無異自絕於國人；後之史者，必當有公平之論。故由於國大的延期召開，各黨各派的是否參加，可以見各黨各派對於和平統一及民主建設的是否具有誠意，以及是否以人民利益爲上；因而使一年來撲朔迷離的政局，轉有開朗的趨勢。</p>
<p>因此，當我們讀到報載中共的聲明，而感到遺憾。國大的召開，原欲熔各黨各派於一爐；欲達到此目的，各黨各派必須以人民利益爲重，捐棄成見，來共同參加。政府之所以一再忍讓者爲此，國大之所以一再延期者亦爲此。如今國大揭慕，各黨各派尤應一致參加，共謀國事。如果國大有「分裂」的現象，則造成此種局勢的便是由中共及其它人士的拒小參加，這不但對國大是一種破壞行爲，亦即是破壞整個民族利益的一種惡毒行爲。人民需要安定，國家需要建設，故他們對於國大的期望甚殷，國大的拒絕參加，實自絕於國人之前；將來的歷史，自必有公平的判斷。</p>
<p>所以對於那些尙未出席國大的人士及尙未提出名單的黨派、我們希望他們能及早參加。這是因爲各方對國大的召開，旣一再表示其意見，爲尊重這些意見，致使國大再番延期，如今國大揭幕，應該沒有不參加的理由。靑年黨旣已提出其名單，則同隸於所謂「第三方面」的民主社會黨及其它人士，前旣爲國事奔走幹旋，此刻允應確認歷史的歸趨，提出其名單，一致參加國大。我們衷誠期望，由於此次國民大會的召開，能够奠定國家長治久安的基礎，進入憲政的常軌；則民有民治民享富強康樂的三民主義新中國，纔能够早日建立起來！</p>

<h3 id="c57">限制使用否決權　決定由五强會商　美蘇兩國均反對修改聯合國憲章 <a href="#c57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社成功湖十六日電〕英外相貝文昨夜邀請聯大會五强代表團，直接討論否決經問題。中美法三國立即接受，問蘇聯方面亦表同意。討論時間可能爲下星期一。消息靈通方面稱，法國將於今日向聯大會政治安全委會提議，停止辯論否決權問題，山五强自行會商可否限制使用否決權。</p>
<p>〔路透社紐約十五日電〕英外相貝文業已致兩聯合國大會之中美與蘇兩國首席代表，建議召開五强會議，以討論否決權問題。五强會商目的在草具一種「行事法則」，規定在何種環境下，五强得以或不得行使否決權。前此英美代表建議由五强舉行非正式談判，討論聯合國機構之各種問題，未爲蘇代表區所贊同，然蘇代表葛羅米柯今日向若干代表表示，願實支持舉行五强會談以討論否決權問題之織。五强所提討論之各項建議，包括：（一）英國要求明白規定威脅和平之「局勢」與「爭端」之定義，若係爭端，則五强之一如爲爭端當事人之一，即不得有表決權。（二）美國建議由五强草具可以使用否決權之各項案件之名單。（三）法國建議之方案，使不願妨礙安理會行動之一强於表決時棄權，令其自動不能行使否決權。</p>
<p>〔聯合社成功湖十五日電〕據英代表團稱，聯合國憲章具有否決權之規定，最初原出美國故總統羅斯福之意，惟吾人迭次袒護五大國全體一致之原則，勇敢有餘，成事不足，不無內疚，吾人固所承認。特澳洲古巴荷蘭等小國即以此爲話柄，企圖修改憲章，亦非所取。如此事竟演化而爲小國對大國之鬥爭，則吾人寗願聯合國大會及早閉幕之爲愈。美國立塲如何，已由參議員康納利在政治安全委會中宣佈九項意見，加以說明。蘇聯外次維辛斯基亦稱，蘇聯始終反對修改憲章，破壞聯合國機構。美代表對此表示同意，謂修改聯合國憲章，聯合國機構或即隨之崩潰。維辛斯基並謂，企圖修改憲章者，實係採取離問敵陣實行個個擊破之戰略，惟此種離間大國之策略，決不能成功。蘇聯誓以大國國結爲基礎，通力合作締造和平，故認古巴澳洲及菲律濱等小國之建議，實鑄大錯。</p>

<p>〔聯合社倫敦十六日電〕自下院議長宣布工黨「反叛」議員對英皇在國會開幕時演說所提修正，可交付討論後，「反叛」議員五十餘人即草擬計劃，請於星期一公開辯論「貝文主義」。「反叛」議員現要求英國採取「社會主義的」外交政策，藉免在目前英國外交政策下蘇美起「必將」發生之衝突。大多數國會觀察家認爲反對貝文政策之議員，其反對方式將僅限於辯論而止，如付表決，則必爲保守派及「忠心」擁護政府之份子所擊敗。，</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦十五日電〕英首相艾德禮，本日曾以長途電話與在紐約之貝文外相通話，對於工黨議員七十三人「叛黨」一事有所商討。按下院今晨舉行會議時，若干與政府意見不合之工黨議員，決定要求於本月十八日，討論外交政策，若輩雖曾宣稱，此舉並不牽涉信任案問題，惟據可靠方面消息，艾德禮首相本日與貝文通話時，曾予外相以一切便利，以便前來倫敦，親自爲英所採取之外交政策，有所辯護。聞貝文外相僅答稱，本人留在紐約，實乃不可缺少，祗得請首相代爲辯護云。</p>

<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦十五日電〕英國下院頃討論絲業問題，認爲英國絲業仍不能與低價傾銷之日絲競爭，故建議政府應向日本美軍當局提出强硬交涉，除非以大量生絲在最短期內輸人英國，否則英國絲業工人勢將失業云。麥帥竭力恢復日本紡織業，並使日本再度成爲遠東之主要工業國，英人不間其爲左派或右派，對之均表焦慮。</p>
<h3 id="c80">佔領期中的日本（上）　佔領工作分爲三個階段 <a href="#c80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>— 紐約時報駐東京特派員　派勞脫原著　張德亁譯</p>
<p>一年以前，在一九四五年八月卅日（美國時間），一架軍用運輸機降落在東京郊外灰塵瀰漫的赤木機塲，麥克阿瑟將軍從梯子上爬下來，開始辦理盟軍佔領日本工作。他身上穿着潔白的開領卡其制服，頭上戴着金綫鑲花的制帽，和他的部下在西南太平洋十幾處灘頭堡中所看見過的一個樣子。別的將領們常穿暗綠色的工裝，藉以避免游擊隊的製擊，麥帥却向來不喜歡着那種服裝的。</p>
<p>留在他後面的，是從新幾內亞東南角一直至菲律賓北部，海陸並進，三年常勝的輝煌戰蹟，但他却漫不經意地對前來迎接他的美日記者發表談話道：「我們經過了一條漫長艱辛的路，可是現在我們似乎已經獲得報酬了。」</p>
<p>但是那天麥帥所開始着手的工作，他的參謀人員至今還在稱它爲「軍事史上最大的賭博」。日本已經宣告投降，並且派遣委員飛赴馬尼丙刺，舉行初步接洽了；可是降書尙未簽字。麥帥手下祗有五萬部隊。而環繞在他們四周的却有四百萬武裝日軍。只要日軍一動手，這少數美軍立刻就會變成俘虜的。然而日軍並未動手，非但沒有動手，還調動大批古老的汽車來運送美軍往東京和橫濱去。</p>
<p>正常的投降儀式，在九月一日下午八時（美國東部戰時時間）在東京灣米蘇里號戰艦上舉行。麥帥在他最大的賭博中所玩的第一副牌是得勝利了。佔領軍在日本住下來，等待日本人依照他們所據以投降的波茨坦宣言條文，建立「一個和平領向的負責的政府」，貢獻於民主政治。</p>
<p>要把這方面的收穫予以估價，應先將佔領的目的，按其性質不同，分作三項程序：（一）日本海陸軍之解除武裝及復員，與民族戰力之消减；（二）掃除政治上之障碍，以便建立合乎盟邦理想之政治——包括一切舊的惡劣的法律與制度，例如「思想警察」，以及政府主催鼓吹戰爭的宗敎系統等；（三）與日人合組一種合作機構，從而產生一種新的民主政治，這是最艱難的一步。</p>
<p>第一階段現已完成。在日本投降後第一年之末，有五百八十五萬二千名日軍業已解除武裝。在美軍轟炸下所殘存的一些日本海軍，也已經完全消滅了。鉅量的武器已經消燬，光是東京一區，就發過三百張執照，讓飛機廠和軍火廠改裝爲民用工廠；另外尙有八十家工廠留着，預備作賠償之用。即使佔領工作到明年就告終止，道一輩子的日本人也來不及使他們自己重新武裝起來的。</p>
<p>第二階段雖已在順利進行中，却尙未達到如此滿圓的程度。根深蒂固的舊的限制性法律已經廢除了，新的美國化憲法和輔助法律系統終得建立起來。强迫日人改革的獨裁式的指令和基本命令的時代，已於本年初宣吿終止了。</p>
<p>現在還不能十分確定，麥帥是否將重新以强迫命令爲武器，來使日人澈底服從他的命令。美方代表艾其森迭次向聯合國管制日本委員會提出報吿，認爲「左翼的極權主義」與奮的軍閥統治並無二致，盟軍最高統帥應嚴禁日本人民走入這兩條歧路。這足以充分說明麥帥總部在這一方面所持的政策</p>
<p>總括去年中所廢除的幾項法制，可以約略看出日本國內的機構已經發生如何巨大的變更。天皇的權力在實際上已受嚴格的限制，一俟新憲法批准以後，（編者按：日本新憲法已在十一月三日正式公布）他在法律上的地位將無異於一尊偶像，——雖然裕仁本身仍獲得大多數人民的感戴，因爲他們認爲全仗他才得結束戰爭，否則軍閥們還是要打下去的。</p>
<p>財閥爲一種大規模的家族資本集團，我們曾正式宣布財閥爲日本軍事機構的贊助人，現在他們已遭凍結，而喪失掉他們的權力了。主要財閥組織如三井·三菱·住友·安田等，均已決定解散。日本所藉以剝削佔領地域的四十五家大「拓殖銀行」亦已被永遠封閉了。（編者按：三井等財閥業於最近正式被解散）</p>

<p>據美海軍發言人昨日披露，彼於十一月十四日曾接獲美國外淸算委員會上海　事處通知，謂美軍在冲繩島大批剩餘藥品之一部份，約一百萬噸，包括美國紅十字會所有之血漿在內，此種血漿係屬美紅十字會所有，並不公開出售。美海國自獲悉血漿有在本市黑市高價出售情事後，現已竭力協助淸算委會，以期從商人手中購回，美海軍已知淸算委會工作人員，正圖禁止血漿在本市之非法黑市買賣，但據調查所得，此種血漿買賣，仍在繼續發生。海軍發言人　稱：美國外淸算委會上海辦事處，正繼續嚴密調查，圖竭力購回血漿，以阻　止非法買賣。</p>
<p>〔聯合社本市訊〕美國國外剩餘物資淸理處上海辨事處，前以血漿售予上海商人，現圖將其收回，送歸紅十字會，此項血漿雖華方買主已允許將其歸還美國國外剩餘物資淸理處，但迄未實行。聯合社上海分社社長郝普遜及記者馬薩，昨日無意中於四川南路吉美飯店對面一堆棧內，發現此項黑市血漿二千餘箱，又於另一堆棧發現敷百箱，預料全部血漿三千五百餘箱可望全部收回。緣郝普遜及馬薩二人昨日在四川南路吉美飯店進餐，時有某餐客見二人爲新聞記者，即手特報紙趨前與二人閒談，並出報紙指示一有關收回血漿之新聞。該餐客旋稱：彼等擬將血漿自堆棧內運出，郝馬兩人聞書，即至堆棧內察看，見一籬笆內果有數百箱血漿。雨人旋又探悉，堆棧內尙有數百箱，且正在計劃其用卡車載走。至此並未見有美海軍卡車前來，即疑心或另有計劃擬將血漿運至秘密塲所。當即電話通知美國國外剩餘物資淸理處上海辦事處，及其他美國機關責詢，獲息，其中無一言知有移動此項血漿之事。此間美國當局自十月三日起，即企圖尋覓收回該批血漿，聞訊後，即趕赴堆棧，其後海岸巡邏隊亦趕至，設稍遲一步，恐血漿至少將有一部份被移去。其後物主曾遣一卡車來堆棧　運血漿，但以美國國外剩餘物資淸理處人員已在，即　空車馳云。淸理處革君且曾爲該卡車攝一照相，車上漆有物主姓名，淸理處上海辦事處主任合維斯亦親來堆棧。此外並有美紅十字會人員數名趕到，但宣稱，純係旁觀地位。經各方面非正式討論後，決定派漲軍海岸巡邏隊一人，駐守堆棧之外，以免被搬運該項血漿，淸理處及紅十字會人員後經人領導，又往其他三處堆棧檢查，以期發現未經收回血漿。旋在百老匯路一堆棧中又藏有數百箱，堆積高達天花板。確數若干，雖未獲悉，但據　　擬行收回之全部血漿，大約均在此兩堆棧內。至　項血漿在市上究已售若干，尙無所知，據稱，擬行收回之三千五百箱，大致可獲成功。每箱計有血漿十二包，每包計爲五百西西。美國紅十字會中國分會幹事馬迪吿聯保社記者稱，美國海軍將負責交血漿運美。</p>

<p>〔本報特寫〕在戰前，中國的人力是不値錢的。生產事業中的工資，低得可憐。外國人把中國的出口貨，列作殖民地貨物（Colonial　goods），意思是這些商品的勞力成品，低得像殖民地榨取的勞工一樣。在許多事業上，使用新式機器反不如用人工來得便宜。在家庭僕役的待遇，更顯出勞力的賤價。以民國廿六年的上海而言，普通僱用一個女　，每月只需二元至四元，一個奶媽亦不過十元左右而已。因此一個小康之家，僱用二三個工人，不算稀奇。</p>
<p>工資漲得高</p>
<p>九年後之今日，一切情形都起了劇變，中國人力之昻貴，至少可和美國相比擬。在生產不業中，中國的高工資已經聞名世界了。以家庭僕役的待遇而論，至少在上海一地，已使中小家庭，視僱用僕役爲畏途。今天在上海僱用一個男僕，做家裏普通的工作，供給膳宿之外，每月的工資要四萬元至六萬元。女工的代價更高，在膳宿外。每月高至七八萬元。如果一個女工，略有知識，粗通文墨，能够煲燙衣服燒燒小菜的，在一個富有的家庭中，可能賺十萬元以上。因此，如以米價来折算，現在家庭僕役的「實際工資」，的確要比戰前好得多了。至於有特殊技術或用途的僕役，其報酬更是豐厚。一個能燒中菜西肴的廚房，月入可在二十萬元以上，普通的亦可拿十幾萬元。乳傭如果檢查合格的，月收可在十五萬元左右，普通的亦在十二萬元左右。</p>
<p>今昔大不同</p>
<p>今日社會上有一個行業，是依　這些家庭僕役而存在的，那就是僱工介紹所，也就是所謂「薦頭店」。從數量的統計上來看，這個行業是在沒落之中。以本市而言，民國十六年前後有介紹所四百家以上，到民國廿六年虞前只有二百多家了。戰時的艱苦生活逼得這批人們，去做小生意，或是出頂了原有的房子，去做其他生意。到今日，上海已只剩下七十多家的僱工介紹所。現在營業不振，每月一共介紹出去的不過一千人左右，其中大部份是女傭。凡經介紹所介紹出去的傭人，都附有保證書，存放於僱用的人家，每隔六個月對保一次，不另取費。經介紹出去的傭僕，在工資談妥之後，照章至少要做三個月。如果不满期而走，介紹所負有另行找人替代的義務。</p>
<p>介紹費駭人</p>
<p>介紹所的經濟來源，是人所習知的所謂「介紹費」。在傭人和東家談好工錢之後，介紹所就開口要介紹費了。在虞前，介紹費由主僕平均負担，現在是東家獨付。介紹費該出多少？這是一個至今沒有解決的間題。在戰前，介紹費是工資的一半。在敵偽時代，介紹費竟高至工資的八倍！現在呢？以僱用的情形而定，並不一律。有一個駭人聽聞的傳說，一個富有的人家，竟出過二十萬元的介紹費！一般情形是兩萬至三萬元，還帶些討價回價的情形。最近傭工介紹業同業公會已呈請社會局，希望介紹費能和工資額相等。不過以本市工資之高，他們如果能得到請求額的一半，已很滿意。事實上，介紹綱太高的話，願意用人的家庭將不走介紹所的路子，這個行業非沒落不可。</p>
<p>公會想統制</p>
<p>傭工介紹所今日的主要困難，是今日一般人家，對於介紹費已深感厭煩。他們現在已改用「傭人介紹傭人」的方式，不肯再光顧俯人介紹所了。因此這個行業陷於大不景氣，各介紹所維持爲難。特別在許多規模較大的介紹所，平常用好幾個職員更感到支持不易。現在該業同業公會正預備向主管機關請求：以後劃一規定介紹費的數目，不准濫索。但同時傭工之就業，一定要通過介紹所這個機構。他們認爲這樣做的話，立刻可以收到工資低落的好處。他們指出本市家庭工資之高昻，主因是由於勝利之後，一般富有人家提高的結果。同時因爲傭工介紹傭工，全市的供求毫無統計，亦是原因之一。據他們說：如果今後能够統籌辦理，多少可收平定工資之效。最近，社會部上海職業介紹所曾與該業公會作初步的接洽，要去了若干材料，這也許是政府管理的開始。事實上，這一業正在没落中，因爲過去的營業方式太舊，沒有眞正替社會盡過服務的功能；要使這業繼續存在，需要公家的指導和監督。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕美國對華政策協會會員，現任该會財務主任柯勃（Kohl-berg）於上星期內來華，日前曾赴京一行，昨日返滬接見訊者於其寓所。據談此次來華任務除私人之商業事務外，並替對華政策協禽負責搜集若干資料。</p>
<p>記者詢以係屬何種性質之資料，柯勃未肯透露，僅謂此次在京曾與蔣夫人陳立夫等晤談，並笑稱：「若干美人心目中認陳立夫氏爲神秘人物，但余（柯勃自稱）所見者則爲一瘦小溫和之人物，余與陳氏晤及時曾舉此以吿，陳氐爲之一笑」云。柯勃已將所欲搜集之資料題目交與有關對象，俟搜集齊全後商接寄美，彼本人因不及等待，，已定於本星期二返國。</p>
<p>柯勃並與記者談及對華政策協會之一般情形稱：該協會於今年六七月間正式成立，其目的在於帮助美國人民瞭解中國國情，硏究正確之對華政策。此外並密切注意各國共產份子之活動。該會主席爲密勒氏評論報主筆老鮑威爾，副主席爲美著名傳敎士費許，常務會員共六十人，大都爲法政領袖作家編緝及對中國有認識有好感之人士今年九月間該會曾上書杜魯門總統建議四點：（一）立即要求蘇聯放棄雅爾達協定中所取得在華之特種權益。（二）斥責中國共產黨之行爲並停止一切對中共之支助。（三）全力支持中國國民政府。（四）改組國務院遠東司，任用與外交政策配合之人員。此項建議書經由總統之秘書遞呈並曾產生相當影響。惟柯勃最後復語記者稱：美國對華政策迄今仍舉棋不定，總統與議院間意見尙未一致，分歧之情形或可於一年內消除而有確定，否則將俟下次大選惟後矣。</p>

<p>按該署發覺吳燧人舞弊始在二週以前。本年十月間行政院根據我國與聯總基本協定，撥款三十二億元交行　作爲本年度聯總在華經常費用，該款乃由行政院墊撥，由中央銀行國庫局支付，但該款匯滬除五億元匯寄行總總務科收訖外，其餘二十七億元乃直接匯寄吳燧人本人。吳於收到匯票後，即向中央銀行支取，由央行國庫局付給本票，吳即將該款私放高利貸取息。起初朱被發覺，至本月初該署當局以　款猶朱到，即向南京行總財務廳詢問，據告早已匯出，該署一面即派員至京調査，一面在滬査究，始發現眞相，即向吳燧人逍回全部原款，並將其革職，但吳所放貸利情形及取息究屬多少，現尙在偵査中。吳燧人現雖未被扣押，但已被當局嚴密監視。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕廣州市商會代表何輯屛，何錫璋，福建省商會代表林中民，駱萍蹤，魏釗等，此次赴京參加全國商聯會，昨乘過滬之便，往訪紡管會業務處長劉文騰氏，提出要求兩點：（一）請擴充現已核准南運之紗布額。（二）南運紗布之運銷事宜，由粤閩兩商會各自派人辦理。劉氏常分別答覆。對於第一點，紡管會近已照首决之核准額，加以擴充。且十月份尙係首次試辦，以後衡量情勢，可再作必要之調整。對於第二點，凡與紡管會規定之運銷商資格符合者，均可經營，似不必拘泥於任何一方面云。至於最近紗布南運情形，據紡管會調査有兩點：堪以注意：（一）自紗布禁運華南後，廣州紗布曾一度極感缺乏，價格飛漲，與上海各地紗價，相差達一百萬元，成爲全國紗布之最高峯。商人以有利可圖，乃設法由陸路運貨，有以（甲）浙贛路爲基點，經江西，福建而達梅縣，興寗，轉水道抵廣州者。（乙）由武漢經粤漢路，至湖南轉運曲江至廣州。（丙）另有自滬郵包直寄廣西梧州，然後由水道順流返穗。郵寄梧　。以收貨未得確定時間，易受時價起跌波動影響，來貨較少。浙贛路運輸輕易費康，故三路之中，以粤漢路來貨最多，平均每日到百件。（二）過去廣州紗布，除香港南洋方面扯銷外，並可銷黔桂，北達湖南贛州等地。至鄂東各地，近以紗布來路，先經上列各處，然後抵達廣州，是以外圍市塲，毋須再到廣州採辦，因此銷較以前狹小。至香港南洋方面，又以香港禁止紗布出口，走私南洋之門戶，遽而被塞。安南政府，又限令進口貨物，必須結匯。而以黑市價格港幣一角一分之越幣，提高至一角七分比一，照價給値，使運越南紗布，不獨無利可圖，反而虧蝕。以此香港紗布價格，反較廣州爲低。南洋香港扯銷不力，走私之風亦不擊自減。向稅局報請分運至可資走私之港口如石岐陽江，四邑，湛江，市橋，樟木頭等地者，亦日漸减少。</p>

<p>烚赤昨初時受壓而低，但一般心理向榮甚切，回升乏力，依然相當有勁，最開二五〇萬五，開後即有獲利多頭了結，不久即退入二五〇萬內，壓力亦來，並爲登記配給關係，實銷買戶稍吿衰竭，曾降至二四七萬五左右，央行以二四八萬五之價，配給二〇〇條，十時後形勢平定，徘徊而已，十時半買風又起，立即回漲至二五〇萬以外，求戶倍見股動，供給稍寂，近午步昂至二五四萬七，午刻在二五四萬左右，午後稍被壓低至二五三萬內，結果較前收再升三萬，飾金掛高至念六萬八，紋銀平銀元再昻，暗拆銀根平和，息價仍在一角二至一角半間。</p>
<p>外幣繼續晋展，美鈔暗盤初時低至四七五〇元，近午復迫近四九〇〇元，一部份新買戶向港幣謀進進展，是以買方力量稍形分散，是以最後仍在四八〇〇元至四九〇〇元之間，較前收續吿上漲，港票旣受申匯報縮影響，後有金鈔助長買氣，猛昻二十元，港電匯亦扳高爲九四〇元至九五〇元，印匯一一五〇元至一一六〇元，英匯一五二〇〇元至一五三〇〇元，成交不見暢達，美匯仍吿呆滯</p>

<p>— 本報特派員杭州</p>
<p>艱苦卓絕的大同保衛戰</p>
<p>十一月二日下午三時，記者團自張垣飛往被圍攻四十五日之大同，空行一小時即達。大同各界代表已在機塲佇候多時。悠揚的軍樂，奏出歡迎的曲子。一位領章上閃鑠着兩顆金星，上　蓄有一撇灰白色的短髭，滿面春風的將軍，和每一位記者親切地握手，熟烈地寒喧，說：「你們來得太好了！太好了！」他就是守大同的英雄—楚溪春，第八集團軍副總司令兼第四十三軍的軍長。</p>
<p>全大同城爲我們的到來掀起歡迎的浪潮。由機塲到城門的送中一隊隊中小學生恭敬地排列着，舉起歡迎的旗幟，高喊歡迎的口號；在城內，每一塊墻壁上都貼了歡迎的標語，每一個居民，在他們瘦削的臉上似乎亦寫着「歡迎」兩個字。　在那些可詛咒的日子，大同是愛苦了，現在我們坐在招待所——雲中飯店融融的爐火旁邊，靜聽楚溪春將軍講述戰事的經過，眞是一首悲壯的史詩！</p>
<p>一首悲壯史詩</p>
<p>大同，曾爲北魏的京都，城內之九龍壁，上下華嚴寺與距城三十里之雲岡石佛，均爲千餘年之古蹟。其地介裏外長城之間，扼平綏鐵路中樞，亦爲同蒲鐵路之起點，雄踞雁北，夙爲軍事重鎭，得失第繫中原安危。去年日本投降，國軍於九月三日以空運部隊接收。共軍因感於大同的存在是對他們控制晋綏，鞏固熱察的一個重大的阻碍，因此必得之而甘心。</p>
<p>大同正式被圍的一天，是八月三日，但實際的戰事，應該起於六月十六日，共軍發動雁北攻勢，朔縣失陷，山陰繼之被佔，大同軍民已經感受到預兆，便作着一種迎戰的準備：集中實力，動員民衆，和儲糧，儲燃料等等。　爲了集中兵力，國軍忍痛地退出口泉，平旺等重要的工業區，堅守大同近郊幾個比較險要的據點，那是以飛機塲爲中心的沙嶺，曹夫樓，北嶽廟，火車站。以這些據點，給伸過來的「魔掌〕以「下馬威」。</p>
<p>我們應該注意到雙方兵力的比較。在共軍方面參加的是號稱精銳之野戰第一，十，十一，十二，十三，十四，十八，三五八，三五九等旅，共三十二個團，約五萬餘。國軍方面，楚溪春指揮的則是一支雜牌軍：第三十八師，東北挺進軍的騎兵第五師，第六師，交通警察隊，保安總隊，通信兵營和自衛隊，總數的有二萬餘人。　當生存受到威脅的時候，一個懦夫亦會變得非常英勇；這支雜牌軍在楚溪春的指揮下結成了一條鐵鞭，他們把沙土的大同變成銅墻鐵壁。單靠軍事還不行。大同三十萬人民，除了殘廢的和懷孕的婦人之外，在保衛戰的進行中都被動員了起來。當時有兩句口號是：「人人自衛，個個參戰！」</p>
<p>戰事愈爲險惡，軍民的心結得更緊。大家產生一種信念：「要死，便死在一起！當死來臨之前，以所有的力量去抗拒它！」大同民衆參加建築工事與救護等等工作而死難的，十共有二百八十一人。</p>
<p>共軍攻打沙嶺，曹夫樓，北嶽廟，火車站四個據點，歷久不下，氧急敗壞。最先的指揮官是姚喆，看看不行，換來了蕭克，仍舊不中用，賀龍親自出馬，亦是不行，最後來了聶榮臻。他改變方式，不用硬攻，而以坑道接近守軍，俾使守軍不打死，亦得餓死。於是，四個據點的守軍被圍困了，和城內的接濟完全斷絕。北嶽廟守軍有一個營，李匯川營長和剩餘的士兵在作戰廿餘日後，已是疲乏不堪，現在更沒有了飲食，他們像野人一樣吃起草來，渴了，便喝各自的小便。過了三天，共軍見廟內沒有動靜，以爲人全死了，放心過來。劈劈拍拍一陣槍聲，又從廟內發出，每一顆子彈都射中了一個人。這使聶榮　驚訝不止。最後，他只好施出一手殺手鐧，在各個據點施放大量毒氣。國軍無此準備，四個據點的守軍全中了毒，才撤退下來。　戰事演進到了城邊，楚溪春整日整夜督飭防守，累極了，和衣在沙發上躺一二個鐘頭，不久，他就會被驚醒，帶了衛兵，到每個防　工事裏去慰問，鼓勵將士，城內的接濟僅賴空軍丟下一些彈藥。各項物資，除了燃料外，均大起恐慌。當時的物價到達了一個可怖的程度，下表是和解圍以後的物價作一比較：</p>
<p>品名　單位　被圍時價格　解圍後價格</p>
<p>小米　一斗　二萬元　四千元</p>
<p>莜麥　一斗　六千元　一千九百元</p>
<p>白麵　一斤　三千八百元　七百元</p>
<p>莜麵　一斤　二千四百元　四百五十元</p>
<p>高粱　一斗　六千元　一千九百元</p>
<p>以此之故，餓死的人，不在少數。</p>
<p>處境愈益艱困，軍民們拼着氣，要拼到最後！楚溪春是河北蠡縣人，共軍神出鬼沒地把他母親和三叔父從家鄉找了來，威嚇她們勸說　氏投降，楚氏不爲所動。共軍又要熟　楚氏的人寫　勸他投降，他把那些信，一一撕個粉碎。</p>
<p>共軍還對它的士兵許下諾言，入城放縱三天！像日軍攻南京時對日兵所許的諾言一樣。如果，傳作義氏不當機立斷，出兵集髯，那末大同是非失不可的。集髯吿捷，亦就是救了大同。九月十六日，國軍自大同城內殺出，施展久困的身手，把一股怨氣寄在子彈上，殺了個痛快。據楚溪春發表四十五天中兩軍雙亡的數字：共軍兩萬以上，國軍　有兩千　。</p>
<p>楚氏特地　我們參觀他部隊的實彈演習。在一塊磚上放一個煮熱的谿蛋，蛋上再壓一塊磚。距離七十公尺，一槍正中鷄蛋，是第一等射手，那個鷄蛋，便賞給那射手吃。一次演習參加的士兵有十五人，每人限發三搶，十五大中有七人是射中谿蛋的，其餘的則無不射中了磚塊。　「八路軍的腦袋有谿蛋大麼？有磚塊那樣大麼？」楚氏握着一　打壞了的鷄蛋，興奮地說，以證實大同戰果的確實。</p>
<p>訪口泉·平旺</p>
<p>大同人歡迎我們的笑　，是淌着眼淚的！共軍沒有進城，城內的損失較小，在城外，則共單足跡所至，隊舍爲墟，田禾蕩然。現在卅萬人之中，有八萬餘人無衣無食，無家可歸。我們在一個新月之夜，去巡視城郊的戰場。沙嶺原爲一百五十戶之村莊，只餘一片瓦礫，路透社記者形容它像「諾曼第戰場」。曹夫廟與北嶽廟都是古蹟，兩隻廟皆已失了踪跡，北嶽大帝的兩隻泥眼，並給挖了去。車站破壞之慘，一如張垣。</p>
<p>十一月三日，我們專車去口泉平旺視察。口泉的永定莊煤礦，與忻州，煤峪口，　家梁，白洞，四志溝，同保，保晉等煤礦，合爲大同八煤礦，在日軍佔領時期，日可產煤八千噸，供　華北各地所需。平旺之發電廠，有兩萬一千克羅瓦特，規模佔華北第一。這些都是國家的財寳，國軍撤出之時，沒有移動過一隻螺絲釘，楚溪春說得好：</p>
<p>「兩兄弟吵架，可不要把祖宗的財產都毀了！「但是共軍却把這些都毀了！八煤礦現用舊法開產，日僅產煤七百噸。平旺發電廠則已頹然如同廢物。有是「帮閒」者認爲破壞是因有戰爭的綠故；且不論戰爭是怎樣起來的，國共兩軍都是當事者，而國軍末動分毫，共軍則大肆破壞，這實在有很多差別，亦使人民認淸了嘴臉，不是輕輕一句話可以掩蓋得了。</p>
<p>我們在兩地徘徊憑吊了許久，坐車回城。半途，在漫天的黃沙中，突然有爲數三百以上的工人和他們的眷屬向我們的車子跪了下來。這使我的心劇然地震跳了一下。我以爲道是舊小說中常常出現的「攔路吿狀」的塲面。</p>
<p>「你們有什麼寃屈嗎？」楚溪春氏問他們。</p>
<p>「呃，總司令，……」爲首幾個年老的又跪了一跪。「八路軍……」。</p>
<p>「噢！他們是爲講八路軍的事。」楚氏回頭對我們說之後，他吿訴這些工人：「你們不要跪，要講的快講吧——他們是中外新聞記者團，特別來訪問你們的情形的。」</p>
<p>我們立刻感到漸愧！窮兵　武者造成了無數慘劇，寫文章的人，對這些一受難者又有若何帮助呢</p>
<p>雨阻大同</p>
<p>依照預定的行程，我們四日須回南京，但專機突然發生故陣，便在大同多躭一日。我們有了空餘的時間去　賞占蹟。雲岡於三日下午才收復，聽說共軍埋有許多地雷，不便去。我們只去遊覧了九龍壁和上下華嚴寺。九龍壁係琉璃瓦製成，各龍均有不同的神采。華嚴寺已作了倉庫，只看看幾個神像而已。</p>
<p>大同的商業衰敗未復，只有銅壺銅鍋是著名的出產。城內小脚女人很多，據說是由鄉下逃進城來的。城裏的女人，則喜歡模倣北平，但總差那麼幾十年。這兒沒有平劇，只有一家戲院演出山西的梆子戲，全是鬧音，一句都聽不懂。　大同執行小組在城被圍時走了，解了圍又回來，彷彿亦是爲了避難。關於執行小組的共黨代表，大同人對我講了一段新聞二　原先的共黨代表名李波，是共軍的一個旅長，在城內，總是單獨地東跑西走。共軍圍了城，這個代表在政府與美方代表離去前便失了　，後來，人們發現他担任了城西的指揮官，正在按圖攻打呢！　這次共黨代表另換了一人，不再敢向外跑，他深知大同的人民會怎樣對付他的。</p>
<p>五日，大同下了雨，機場泥濘不堪，壞的飛機無法修理，而別的飛機亦無法下落。記者團遂趁便赴集寗視察，同時打電報給北平，南京，請派機至集寗接返，因爲集髯的機場要比大同的好一點。（特派員杭舟寄）</p>

<p>— 本報東北特派員韓清濤</p>
<p>七日安東航訉</p>
<p>安東是個好地方，是國門，是工業地，是礦產區，是漁市場，是水陸碼頭，同時也是風景區。</p>
<p>從瀋陽飛到安東去，四十分鐘的時間够了，起飛時是一片大平原，過了本溪，進入山地，荒山盡裏，僅河谷地方，時常閃露一些村鎭，不久，豁然開朗，又是一塊平原，展延到鴨綠江邊，延伸到朝鮮境去，安東到了。</p>
<p>氣候好過了瀋腸，瀋陽田園樹木已經光禿，這裏還可看到黃綠一片，夾雜着點點紅葉，鴨綠江綠水悠悠，發源白頭山，蜿蜒二百里，從這流向汪洋大海，風光顯得異常美麗。</p>
<p>兩個樣子不同的大鐵橋，跨越鴨綠江上，銜接着國際交通，沿江屹立蕭安東長大的市區，對岸就是韓國的新義州，隔江相望，汽笛互聞，我們工廠的烟囪，整齊的工廠房屋，已有壓倒對方的趨勢，在飛機上，俯瞰地面，兩個市區連於鐵橋一綫，形成了安東特別重要性。</p>
<p>黑煙消逝機聲靜</p>
<p>飛機塲，在市區中心遙遠的西南方，有一條很長的柏油路，從市區通到飛機塲，馳行這條長的三十八里的道路上，從飛機塲起，走了不久就可看到道旁矗立的大工廠，帽兒山下，鴨緣江邊，過去黑烟瀰漫空際，機聲軋軋，現在是靜悄悄了。</p>
<p>在工塲方面，僞滿時，計有『滿洲自動車製作工塲」「東洋議維安東工塲」「安東洋灰工塲」「滿洲實業工廠」「滿洲輕金屬工塲」，滿洲礦業精鍊所」「鴨綠江製材（造船）合同株式會社」「鴨綠江製紙會社」「安東製紙工廠」「六合成製紙廠」「滿洲紡織會社工廠」等，此外還有膠皮，火柴，製紙等大大小小的工廠，因此造成了安東工業發達的現象。</p>
<p>可惜的是現在僅剩下　　了，有的更被共軍燒炸一光，上一個黃昏，記者參觀過成了一片瓦礫的巨大變電所，也看過了和變電所有同樣情形的鴨綠江造紙廠，大家都感覺到了十分的痛心，老百姓說：「起先蘇軍搬走了各大工廠一部份機器，今天共軍除了搬走的以外，其餘的又徵底破襲了，』在參觀「牡丹江造船廠』的時候，僥倖的沒看到火燒的慘狀，有幾條沒造完的大木船，堆存的木料，靜靜的　着，一位自稱：「我是會社寶任者」的人說：僞滿時，每年可造三百隻大木船，光復後，岸上有未造成小木船九十二隻，河裏四十二隻，一年間，經過共軍使用和拉走，現在所存不足二十隻了。</p>
<p>一度變成暗地獄</p>
<p>從破壞的「安奉鐵路管理局』門前，走到鴨綠江橋頭，兩座橫跨鴨綠江上的大鐵橋，悠然高　在河面，右邊的一座是日本明治四十四年落成，左邊的一座，標的是紀元二千六百零一年，每座橋　橫　　鐵絲網，織下也是一樣的情景，兩個哨兵，監視　橋那頭，那邊也放上了鐵絲網，站着的是蘇聯的士兵，交通斷絕了，但是相互間保持着友誼态度。</p>
<p>安東市沒有了共軍，幾個變電所遭到了徹底的破壞，蘇方也不供給電了，於是安東市成了黑暗世界，同時沒有自來水吃，不得</p>
<p>不改喝苦　的并水，爲了這個嚴重的問題，地方維持會曾經派人和蘇方交涉，交涉地點，是鐵橋中心點，兩方人員都不多走一步，一共是兩對，一個譯員，一個交涉人員，三次交涉，未得結果，此外還有一次是我兼警備司令趙公武的照會，問題是在國軍初到安東的時候，新義州蘇機，飛越鴨綠江，翱翔安東市空，照會上吿以：「如發生事故，我方不負若何責任」，蘇機從此不過江了。</p>
<p>新義州發電機關，是僞滿和朝解所共有，因爲僞滿也投了資，可是新義州電有大量剩餘，安東人民遭受無電痛苦，同時安東到大連間的高壓綫路，完整如初，從新義州輸送大連電力開關，在我橋頭，我們除了希望和蘇聯在友誼合作外，對於橋頭開關，和在我們地面上的電廠水堤等，都在加意的保護着。</p>
<p>我們站在橋頭上，遙望對岸，工廠黑烟縷縷，熱氣騰騰，火車來往不絕，江岸上佈滿了大小船隻，有的正在上下游行進，一切顯是着緊張有生氣，我們這邊呢，工廠殘廢了，江邊沉寂着，剩下的三個車頭，負着艱巨的責任，往來於安東草河　間，一切等待恢復，新生！</p>
<p>老百姓熱情磅礴</p>
<p>安東市，自僞滿建設大東港後，擴大建設都市計劃，市境北起東頂子，南至大東滿，南北距離約四十纤，長方形的市區，依靠着鴨綠江，面積約達二九七平方籽，人口的計三十三萬，這是僞滿在民國三十一年的統計，裏面有日鮮人五萬四千人，當時擬定五年內，造成人口四十萬的都市，現在日人已經少見了，鮮人　下的也不多。</p>
<p>安東的老百姓，有着山東人的典型，性格和語關，多是豪爽，熱誠，雖然他們手裏還握着許多用血汗換來的「遼東軍區」共軍鈔票，但他們還是歡迎被他們目爲「神兵天降」的國軍，這股熱情　勁，應該如何地珍惜它，保持它！</p>
<p>物價低於瀋陽，但因物資多被共軍拉走了，外來的人多了，所以有逐漸上漲的趨勢，目前僅猪肉一項，已經從僞滿鈔五十元一斤，漲到了八十元，其他漲風有同樣的情勢，流通券運到安東了，潘陽的商人也來了，這也是物價上漲的因素。</p>
<p>商人幾全已開門營業，但貨色很缺乏，有名的安東　綢料，也沒有了踪跡，康價的魚蝦和海味市上也缺貨，原因是在江邊或海沿捕魚的人，時常受到朝鮮方面的槍擊，現在和朝鮮交通的路又斷了，魚蝦和海味那裏來！</p>
<p>安東市立小學有三十六校，已經全數開學，省立初高級和女中三個臨時學校生，有學生一千二百多人，，也上了課，惟教育經費缺乏，其他困難也很多，僅課本一項，就成了問題，省府雖冒了「七聯」大不諱，印了小學課本一萬册，但還沒能解決這個嚴重的問題。</p>
<p>日僞譽爲一滿洲」八景第一位的鎭汪山，雖然沒有了櫻花，但，風光依然，可是花了不少本錢的神社建築物，已經是黯然無光，元寳山頭，市街要衝，砌起了許多防禦堡壘，市區外團也已安定，人民正以熱烈的心情”接受並擁護政府來建設！</p>

<p>說一件「爲人民服務」的募捐　事吧，你的保長，後來又陸在　長，由於後來他常到我去的地方來巡風，因之我便淸楚知道他的的確確只會說「共產黨頂好」與「別的人不行」的二句話，此外便一無所知與一無所能了：話說的有些離題了，現在還是談談募捐的故事吧，有一天我在你的人民家裏談天，這位保長仁兄光臨了，你的人民便狠慷慨的拿出你的票子一百五十元，一面雙手奉上，一面在說「……這一百兀是我捐的，這五十十元是我代張家墊捐的，」這時候保長的兩隻老鼠眼直向我看，好像是在說「爲什麼當着生人面交給我錢呢」似的，但終於放進袋子裏走了，保長去後，從你的人民口中知道這件募捐的詳情，事實是這樣的：</p>
<p>你的保長頭一天來說，有一個窮老百姓死了，沒有錢買棺材，保上向棺材店欠買一口來，現在人已經抬出去了，棺材店的欠款，要大家捐些錢來付賬，「有沒有捐册，收條，棺材店發票呢？」我問，你的人民說「什麼都沒有」，「那末你爲什麼一定要捐錢給他呢」？我問，你的人民說「鬼上門來，不化錢買點紙燒，鬼不走終歸要出毛病的」，我們在相對苦笑里談話終止了，我想這件募捐故事，旣不是「共產黨爲人民服務」，也不是「人民爲共產黨服務」而是，「人民與共產黨都爲眞正的壞蛋服務」，我這種說法，不知毛先生以爲然否？</p>
<h3 id="c180">一片反蘇聲 <a href="#c180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>— 本報記者朱尊諸十月廿五日航訊</p>
<p>十月二十二三兩日，英國下院討論英國外交政策，第一日外相貝文報告，第二日首相文德禮反對黨領袖邱吉爾和國務大臣麥克紐爾相繼演說。下院會議室裏的空氣緊張，聲音嘈雜，那時我在旁聽席上，遙聽着的祗是一片反蘇聲。</p>
<p>貝文的報吿並無驚人之處祗是產申英國外交政策，邱吉爾的責問卻是驚動四座：目前在蘇聯和東歐蘇聯聯軍隊有二百個師，而且都是戰時組織，工黨政府知此事吾？他說，一九三九年以前，希特勒寫了一本「我的奮鬥」，我們還容易預料納粹德國的動向，目前克姆林宮的動向如何，野心何在，完全是一個悶葫蘆！邱吉爾此言一出，雖有一部份議員驚他是危言聳聽，倫敦泰晤士報也攻擊他不應該在目前緊張的國際局勢下公開的作此驚人之論，但沒有人不承認這一個問題的嚴重性，英國輿論界一致認爲「向史達林讓步」的時期應該吿一段落了。艾德禮首相在十月廿四日英國工會席上痛斥蘇聯的愚民政策，大駡共產黨非失妄行；邱吉爾接着又指共產黨爲　虫，英國朝野一致的反蘇言論，這還是有史以來第一遭，第一次世界大戰後，英國政府對新成立的蘇聯政府雖然也曾攻擊不遺餘力，但在那時不過是主義和理想上的差別，目前的攻擊則根源於事實和國際政局的演變，也許會種下第三次世界大戰的種子！</p>
<p>擁護邱吉爾的人和一部份保守黨報紙借題發揮，開始把現在的邱吉爾和慕尼黑時期的邱吉爾相比擬，以爲邱吉爾現在語驚四座和他在第二次大戰前的性質完全一樣，那時他也是被人攻擊爲危　，但他字字都是根據事實，後來國際局勢的演變一步一步的都證實了他的深思遠慮，目前國際形勢的黑暗並不亞於慕尼黑時期，邱吉爾又發出了他的警告，他一時雖曲高和募，但其眞實性會逐漸的被有識之士所發見。這種論調也不過是要把邱翁再度的英雄化罷了，邱吉爾本人並不認爲他的聲音孤單，他在下院裏說過：一年前他在美國福爾登城演說，主張英美同盟防禦侵略，那時舉世震驚，一部分英國義員還不客氣的咒罵他挑撥是非。此論如在今日發出，使沒有人大驚小怪了。</p>
<p>英國朝野一致的對蘇聯和蘇聯卵　下的各國共產　表示不滿，隨處可以看到。邱吉爾解釋「反動份子」一詞尤爲幽默，他說：共產黨武裝向我們進攻，我們反抗，於是我們被認爲「反動份子」！艾德禮首相也說：祇要你不是共產黨，便是法西斯—一位議員提到波蘭時，說了一句非常俏皮的話，他說：每次史達林打一個噴啑，波蘭政府必定大傷其風！麥克紐爾提到英美和蘇聯政府都希望和平時，有一位議員大聲反駁：希特勒也未始不希望和平！</p>
<p>英國的外交政策常被人視爲美國國務院的尾巴，這也許是過甚其詞，但其中不免有幾分真理，在蘇聯勃勃野心的局勢下英美步調之一致應該椒意料中事，因此說英國外交部椒美國國務院的尾巴固然不錯，反過來說貝爾納斯是貝文的同志也未始不可。戰後國際會議席上英美和蘇聯的　突是相同的，尤其是從軍事上看來，假如以蘇聯爲對象，英美的步調沒有差異，也不可能有任何差異，所不幸的是英美和蘇聯的對立完全是一種爭地盤的姿態，雙方的要求都大，雙方都沒有達到目的，因爲蘇聯的軍隊在東歐和中歐，凡關於紅軍所在地的一切問題，蘇聯一概不肯戰步；而在北菲，義大利，希臘及其他地中海區域，英美的軍隊在那裏，凡關於這些地帶的問題，英美一概不肯讓步，因此這個爭執愈來愈僵</p>
<p>即將來華的名政論家下院議員巴特萊氏（Vernon　Bartlett）曾爲文忠吿貝文外相，認爲目前英國的朋友盡是各國的右　和反動份子，利用各國的國家主義反杭蘇聯的國際政策；他觀吿貝文放棄這種作風，不要失去溫和左派份子的擁護，他認爲貝文的外交政策無論是在希臘，在西班牙，以及在中國都是採取「守」，因之所謂「大衆」都傾向莫斯科。巴特萊雖然屬無黨無派，但他的論調也許可以以代表一般反對貝文外交的工黨份子，但能否打進工黨政府領袖的耳鼓裏去還是一個問題。英國工黨雖號稱爲社會主義，但其對外政策一時很難放棄根深蒂固的帝國主亦作風，所以有一位漫畫家畫了一幅識笑貝文的諷刺畫，這幅畫分兩部份，第一部份裏有一批英國外交官排列着，旁邊站的是前保守黨外相交登，第二部份裏還是那一批英國外交官，旁邊站的是工黨外相貝文，而且艾登和貝文的姿态完全一樣，都是作訓話姿勢，都是右手插在上衣口袋裏。</p>
<p>英國外交作風旣然如此，尤其是這幾天反蘇　高漲時，英國共產黨和極左份子心裏當然有說不出的苦痛，但他們在英國政治舞臺上的力量有限，英國全國共產黨員不過四萬五千人，在下院裏祇佔有二席。他們的機關報「每日工人報」最近大駡保守黨和工黨政府調情，痛斥邱吉爾和貝文擁抱，和艾登禮飛吻，但這微微之音很難發生作用，不過是聊供他們自已出氣而已！</p>

<p>— 管玉</p>
<p>「鶯飛人間」這劇本是描寫一侗歌唱家願爲大衆而歌唱的事。這是一個很光明的好主題。但是它的劇情，和這卞題的關係實在太少了。因爲主人翁願意爲大衆而歌唱的事實表現不够深人劇情。她的說話和她的行動不能整個的打成一片。不實行的語言，我們呌他口號，在這里「爲大眾而歌唱」的主題就成了口號。但我不抹煞它的一些零星的表現方法。如：出一張五十萬的支票讓一他們成立一個音樂團，反對票價漲高等等，這些並不能完全合乎一那個主題。雖然地參加了任雲他們的樂隊，免費慰勞平民，但她慰勞平民所唱的歌曲中的歌詞，和平民有什麽關係呢？爲大衆而歌唱的目的，不會是只呌平民們聽聽歌聲就算完了的，一定要在歌曲中給平民一種啓示，一種生活上的力量，才算更符合這主題。只是爲了讓平民們聽聽歌聲的話，我以爲很可以讓戲院子里的票價漲高，然後在劇院里提出若干贈券，分贈給平民們，這樣不是一舉兩得嗎？何必一定要戲院和平民分開呢？假使戲院里唱的東西和平民所能聽到的是絕對兩種不同的歌曲，那就必須分開。</p>
<p>在劇中，魯斯曲自殺了。柳鶯和任去向各處流浪，眞正地爲了大衆而歌唱了。但是我們還有到了舞台面上的歌舞場面，難道這些也是免費招待平民而演出的嗎？假使眞是爲平民而演出，我們却沒有看到一個平民。</p>
<p>這個劇本，除去了歌唱和歌舞塲面，我們還能看到什麼。這劇本中的人物，那一句話是代表人物性格的。道劇本中那一段情節的發生是必然的？沒有，所有的全是偶然的，機會的。</p>
<p>這劇本中的主題，雖然有一隻主題歌來表現，但我們只看歌詞的話，那一節又能合乎劇中的情節，或是人物呢？沒有，一點兒影子也沒有。所有的只是導演者所取的片斷的鏡頭配合着這歌詞搬映在觀衆的眼前。</p>
<p>這劇本若不是被導演者靈活的鏡頭所挽救，將成爲一個空洞的東西，若是導演者處理的歌舞場不美麗不壯觀，則將是一個不値一看的片子。幸而導演者的手法，使我們看完了片子，覺得它還不壞，還値得一看！</p>
<h3 id="c182">談導演 <a href="#c182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>— 居壘</p>
<p>國產電影第二部「鶯飛人間」，已在「皇后」開映了，一般地說，方沛霖先生能運用一個多月的工作時間，攝成這一部繁複的歌舞片，已屬難能可貴。主角歐陽飛鶯又是第一次上銀幕露臉，一切都須費力地精心　劃，一切都須省時省錢，用中國影壇的現况作估計，我們更不應提出苛求，因爲方先生已運用他大刀闊斧的才力，盡其所能了。</p>
<p>我想對牠苛刻地檢討一下，反正，這只是我私人的意見，決無損於這幾天皇后門前萬人空巷的擁擠情况的。</p>
<p>從導演說，方先生以聰明的佈景起家，鏡頭的圓活運用，打定他導演的基礎。本片中龍運用佈景，是他的看家本領，片中「香格里拉」，戲院中，及柳鶯家中幾堂置景，也可說盡善盡美，可惜方先生的精力旣專任於此，對全劇「情緒」和「氣氛」上却輕輕忽略了，舉一個例，片首柳鶯和音樂家邂逅一幕，說她見擾於富商巨紳的盲目追求，記者的角逐詢問，整天忙不開交，觀衆只會向站在金碧輝煌的戲台上的紅歌女拍掌喊好，誰也不會聽到她卸裝時站在化裝鏡前一聲疲倦的嘆息；爲珍惜自己似水流）年，爲珍惜自己花容月貌，把熱愛在舞台上分給觀衆，飽受了種種詔笑阿諛以後，她一樣會感到心力交瘁，一樣會感到無可寄託的寂寞。於是，她對窗外柔靜的夜晚有所遐思，到那裏去找尋這份生命的泉源，以潤澤自己枯寂的心靈呢？正像珍媧麥唐納在「桃花恨」（May　time）中，接受監護人約翰巴里摩亞的求婚請求後，立刻心亂如麻，困　萬狀。她避開了前台熱烈的掌聲，在靜寂的小巷裘囑咐她車夫駕上馬轡，向星光明亮似寳石的天邊隨意駛去，途中在一家下等的酒店中過見了保羅，熱情，豪放，英俊，瀟　—千萬年中就不曾錯過了這一次萍水相逢，千萬年中就刻骨銘心地等着這一刻，面前停着的正是她理想的小舟，可以載上她向那更浩瀚更廣關的人海中駛去，兩個人的愛情不是偶然的，早等待好久了。所以，這晚上柳鶯小姐馳車回家，在雨中跟陳天國會了面，就一往情深，滿是憐才惜玉的意思了，但方先生對柳鶯下裝時，包園在她周遭的羣衆，旣未刻意加以處理，以襯出她心力交瘁的情景。柳鶯避開她的追逐者，快快活活地回家去，前面旣無煩倦的壓積，後面自缺乏熱情的泛流。所以，兩人相遇而一見傾心，就覺得不自然了。</p>
<h3 id="c183">談歐陽飛鶯 <a href="#c183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>— 老波</p>
<p>一個初上銀幕的演員，情緒是興奮的，心裏是害怕的。爲了她總覺得我是在演戲。但是歐陽飛鶯的戲很出乎意外，她並不像一般初上銀幕的演員那樣「怯塲」，導演又全力增加歌唱的塲面以减少她演戲的機會。她歌喉的音調近似Mizzo-Soprano主題歌「起誓」「雨濛濛」數曲唱得不壞，她是一個歌星，歌唱得的確不錯，也够好聽的了。然而她的演技並不能算成功。但她是一個可造就的人材，只要她能够虛心學習。</p>
<p>願歐陽飛驚能够多多練習國語，多看外國明星們的表演，以能够體味到他們演技的出發點和方法，甚至於她們的演技程度，就是：怎麼樣是恰到好處，怎麼樣就過火，怎麽樣就不够。這樣的了解，就等於你有了底子。這是一個演員應該有的條件，和學習時的目的。</p>
<p>更要緊高的是能够經得起批評。說你好，你也不要笑。說你不好，你也不要跳。無論什麼樣的批評文字，只當作一個參考資料，或是把它們作爲自己成功和失敗的鏡子。但是，頂要緊的是自已埋頭苦幹，做更上一層樓的準備。否則祗有失敗！</p>

<p>— 江烏</p>
<p>嚴　在「忠義之家」要已經和我們見了一次面，這次在「鶯飛人間」中是第二次出現了。顯然地他比前一劇中更有成就。他在「鶯飛人間」中演一個固執而有偏見的老音樂家。他用「僵」　子來表現他的固執和自以爲是的高貴，完成了性格的一部份。他的演技很好，尤其是他在病床上時，趕走柳鶯的吼聲，一聲比一聲高和有力，不得不使對方屈服於他道三聲「滾」中。他指揮的時候，臉部的微笑，表現了他的得意和他訓練柳鶯的成功，同時也表現了他的自信心。</p>
<p>他是一個有修養的演員，所以在鏡頭前，水銀燈下，優悠自然的發揮了他的演技，在全劇中，只有他一個人的演技最成功！</p>
<p>他是北平人，說着一口流利悅耳的國語，有使人陶醉的力量。但他的外形限制了他演劇，使他只能在反面的角色裏轉圈圈，這是很可惜的！</p>

<p>— 朱德豐</p>
<p>「鶯飛人間」總於繼「忠義之家」而上映。在充滿了美國片的常前，一部國片的產生，常然是很受觀衆的歡迎，何况又是在這不容易的難產聲中呢？</p>
<p>在國片中歌舞片向來是不多。人才的稀少，物質條件的不够，誰都知道，這是我國電影事業的致命傷。然而却不能因爲缺乏上述的條件，就不幹。雖然不能與好萊來塢片相並論，但至少也能够逐步的進步，發揚些敎育意義有些成績的表現。</p>
<p>「鶯飛人間」是勝利後第一部的歌舞片，導演方沛霖，在國片的歌舞片導演中，可以說是富有經騐的能手。看完了全片，覺得幾個歌無塲面很好。</p>
<p>歐陽飛鶯飾柳鶯，雖然嗓省潦亮，歌唱得不錯。不過有幾處的表情欠深刻。這是她躍登銀幕第一部片子，大體說來，已經不容易了。關宏達很生動，演技表情都很適當，且頗向然。嚴肅的魯思曲也還不錯。這片雖不能與好萊塢五彩歌舞片比，然而國片有國片的特點，與西片之作風當然有異，它是另有一種滋味的。</p>

<p>— 祝西</p>
<p>狂戀</p>
<p>題意與「情海妒渤」差不多，不過是將男主角的嫉妒，改爲女主角的。最後都以毀滅日己而賈禍於旁人，至法庭　寃爲結束。</p>
<p>從其結構看來「狂戀」是勝於「情海妒潮」，因爲後汎欠強的成份太多，敎觀衆害人的門檻也太精，前者在這兩點都較好。</p>
<p>「狂戀」的編劇太注重於對白而忽略了戲，雖然在幾處的對白是很細膩生動的，例如：常康納維爾德在打字機剛打完「我要同你結婚」的夫妻調情一塲。但是其沉悶而無聊的塲面也處處可尋，這便是編劇的忽略。幸而導演很替他顧到這一點，在沒有戲的時候儘量利用鏡頭上的活躍而使他「有戲」。在康納從客廳門出來到打字機旁去工作時，是導演故意讓他從室內踱出，經過一所游泳池，轉一個　，靜悄悄地，當然取景　色彩都很美，還配以諧和的音樂；然後再讓他坐下去打字。爲「戲」起見，特地把將有一大套「少戲的對白」的珍妮葛蘭放在花棚上，和琪恩泰妮放在水池下，使該段戲不致太悶。</p>
<p>一全片導演的戲就雖不太行，但其努力的成績時時可見，琪恩泰妮第一段戲太話劇化，後部極好。康納維爾德稱職，珍妮葛　平平。</p>
<p>男女之間</p>
<p>故事是描寫母女互相體貼的情緒與彼此用心的良深，但因社會習慣的緣故，與我國情形似不吻合。但是戲是一個好議。</p>
<p>如果說這部片子導演不壞，那還不如說編劇的底子打得好；與其說是編劇的成功，還不如說黛娜巴里摩亞的突出。</p>
<p>黛娜巴里摩亞是已故大明星約翰巴里摩亞的女兒，美國的「梨園世家」——他們世代擅演莎士比亞名劇，這部戲的製片人便利用她能演多方面戲的關係，就挑了一個以舞台演員作爲主角的戲給她演，也許可以說是特地爲她編製這一個劇本的。如此說來，製片人是相當聰明。</p>
<p>果然黛娜演來是不錯的，尤其難得是扮演一個十二三歲的小姑娘，雖然這種戲容易討好，但是其難演也是事實。</p>
<p>老娘姨末次回來是多餘的，編劇者之意思是團圓，其實這就不能免「俗」。</p>
<p>開幕結束都在戲台上，並且都應用得極好。</p>
<p>全劇就是看黛娜一個人，她一個人就可以給你二小時的滿足。</p>
<p>尼羅河女皇</p>
<p>瑪麗蒙丹和強霍爾，總是那一套—</p>
<p>不過這部片子的佈景與色彩還不錯，馳馬的幾景也處理得可以，亂石滾滾的幾個鏡頭還不太馬虎。　比較起來比「阿利巴巴四十大盜」，「天方夜譚」好上一籌。</p>
<p>至於演員都是他們的老搭擋，瑪麗蒙丹演的這一類片子已經來得很多，不看之前，也幾乎可以下一定論。不過總之一句話瑪麗蒙丹是賣「美」不賣「戲」的，如果演技能够壓過瑪麗蒙丹的演員，是決不肯和她配戲的，如此，就更可知該片演員的一斑了。</p>

<p>— 馬博良</p>
<p>狂戀</p>
<p>美麗的山，美麗的河，湖水，陽光，月亮，海灘，屋宇，多麼美麗的世界，若是沒有愛情，一切美麗還不是荒凉。我一向覺得一個人活着的總是他一個人的世界，他永遠不能佔有另一個人的世界，尤其不能分享另一個人永遠的情感，這裏的女主人公不甘獨守個人世界的寂寞，頓萌殺機，殺人同時也殺書自己，「在戀」的題材可謂「情海妒潮」主人公性別的轉換，動機則一，雖然「狂戀」的女主人公較之「情海妒潮」的男主人公猶覺狠毒，可憎的郤是那個猥瑣的男子，這個女主人公固然自私，但是比較値得同情，她是一個可憐的悲劇人物。有時候我們可以靜想一下，誰的愛情生活裏插得入第三者的影子？</p>
<p>導演史達爾不是一個特出的人材，一　歌儷影」的零亂便是明證，本片成績比較優秀，攝製了許多前所未見的風景，襯上快心悅目的色彩，合爲一個燦爛的背景。溺斃小叔一幕戴上太陽眼鏡有雙重妙用，聰明無比，水面上的一雙求救的手和幾個泡沫，最爲潑刺有力，過目難忘。配音以放馬山頭的幾下鐘鼓，有繞樑三日之感，其他尙嫌不够明說。女主角琪恩泰妮，演技遠較「摩登天堂」精彩，有些女人不一定美麗，可是知道如何使自己看來美麗，琪恩就是最好的典型，火車邂逅和床上求吻迷惑有餘，衣着非常華麗，加上她特具的性感，俱足使其保持成功。男主角康納維爾德，不及同時竄紅的「天國之路」男主角葛雷高萊潘克的沉毅。</p>
<p>男女之間</p>
<p>是一串鬧劇的笑聲，車利柯斯脫依然是他在「巴黎允物」「滿處芳」的本色，把戀愛視爲一種兒戲，讓一個担任女演員的女兒爲了母親，鬧得滿天神佛，鷄犬不寗。戲幕從舞台開始，又在舞台上完結，亨利柯斯脫的導演手法流利，通暢，不時增加層層疊疊的笑料，有時太誇張了，像在開汽車亂行溜冰，和擲女入河幾幕，似乎過於作踐女子，吵得不亦樂乎，微顯粗暴，其他都使人得到溫文的快樂。女主角狄安娜巴里摩亞演出驚人，駕輕就熟，眞是受妙爽朋，在不鬧的時候，睜着杏眼笑得甜甜的，瓊杜白莉一樣的可愛，而其風度之都雅勝似柯斯脫過去一手提拔的狄安娜寳萍，我想着有一天她可能超越克勞黛考爾白，她的年靑，健美，活潑會使她成爲一個優秀的喜劇演員，如今她一個人演活了「男女之間」。凱茀蘭茜絲只好專演母親，美人　暮，有甚麼話可說呢。羅勃孔敏士，合格而已。</p>
<p>寶石花</p>
<p>一幅又一幅夢中的　畫，夢中的色彩，我們根本在追隨夢中的道路，山原上的野人會，樹林裏的收笛，小戀人悲澀的初吻，溪流邊少女的影子和落葉，花的蓓蕾，黑夜的漫談，女神的幻現……聽不懂俄羅斯草原民族的粗言粗語，幻夢的意味郤在眼簾上抹過一道又一道彩霞，攝影和着色的淸麗超過圖畫，那是音樂和美術的結晶，好萊塢缺乏的淸麗的氣質，「在戀」有另一種光艷的畫面，但絕不是「實石花」朦朧的自然，美國人從未想到的青靑的林木和黯冷的岩石。導演手法稍嫌繁復，溶入溶出鏡頭成千簾一律，配音未能盡量運用，有時靜止無聲，沒有帮助情緒，但是有那一陣牧笛，勝似其他萬十聲調了。</p>

<p>— 賀天健</p>
<p>月之在泰淮，固無異於他處，不必秦淮始有月也；更不必月在秦淮始有如何情味也。月則無所不有，而秦淮原是秦淮。惟諭天下之月何處最多，則余覺秦淮最多。於是秦淮水上之月便成此文之題眼。</p>
<p>余處秦淮十年不相見矣！倘在十年中遊秦淮，若夫「隔江猶唱後庭花」余何忍聞之也。故余決不去。而「淮水東邊舊時月」則無時不依　於余心！今日，敵潰矣，國復矣，而余不可不去！去則，月猶照我於秦淮。——秦淮之月無異，而秦淮之北岸則變成商場，歌唱之聲喧聞沸天，叫賣之音雜沓街頭，奎光閣不見閣，奇芳閣只留前樓；酒樓茶館涕涶滿地，文德橋利涉橋穢臭刺鼻，晝舫破敗，泊在東頭；一道淮水，澄清無日；依然污濁不堪也。余乃買醉於文德橋頭，一丸涼月漸漸中天。余微醉，四顧無相識者；惟覺月有發問意，有感傷意！似問余，何期在此日此地而相逢耶？汝之頭顱半白，何期在此地此時而看余耶！人生草草，曾幾何時，已白了少年之頭！余乃不得不回想到十年前之在秦淮月。」</p>
<p>十年前，即二十五年之春，春之月，其色華；秋之月，其色清；此次之月，當與爾時之月不同，——爾時，余頭未白；舉「個展」於中華路畔，滕若渠爲余作文張之。—今滕固已死！—一夕余與滕子買歌於秦淮畫舫，滕子出其所作之古文商量，問余曰此古文乎？余曰習古文者爲新文自以爲新之極，而習新文者見之仍嫌古；習新文者而爲古文亦然，滕頷之。余更曰：文何嘗有新古，徒以習慣之故耳。酒既酣。一三五少女搊琵琶，度月灣灣曲；時舟已移近東城，遠處鍾阜橫塗，一墨痕於天際，爾時更不知何者爲名利也。而月益皎，看歌者之目嫵媚甚，不得不想到十年前秦淮月夜之小金紅。</p>
<p>二十一年前，即十四年也。爾時正初夏，余執教鞭於秦淮之南，秦淮之畫舫，充塞如櫛，兩岸猶有河房水榭；夕陽在山，明燈畫簾下，有倚蕭者，有笑語者。一夕，月如水。余與友人僱畫舫，作醉飲計。有少艾名小金紅者，度曲如鶯；私詢之，知其爲良家子被騙落藉，憐之。身價甚微，舉之易。逾日適黃伯秋君出金購余畫由同鄕孫乃湛兄居間經理，得十五金；不足，爲同鄉居京者作一聽歌圖；得四十金，即爲小金紅脫藉，更典一皮裘作旅費，遣之歸。—蓋小金紅固有一母舅在京，乃吝慳忍澀人也，望之不肯援；至此，始認爲甥，亦由余交涉者。從此，余無夜不在秦淮；而有月色之夕，興益濃，然此時望月每有「三十華年似流水」之惑！的無二十餘歲時之情境矣！</p>
<p>二十一歲時，余讀書於淮清橋之民國監獄學校，與秦淮密邇。夜夜聽歌　飲；每至潤酣耳熱，常與皖省董君航田君模圖慷慨談國家大事，攬澄之責有「舍我其誰」之槪！放舟板橋之東，楊柳兩岸；皓月西移猶容與其中，不忍歸也。</p>
<p>嗟乎！今日之秦淮月，猶昔日之秦淮月也；而人已垂垂老矣！何者之責，何者之事；蓋已不堪語之於今日之余。余好畫，余好詩；然猶不善經商其事；如何做廣告，如何弄手腕，余固非所願也，秦淮之水雖濁，秦淮之月仍潔；余在秦淮，余心如月；一杯在手，呼月來共飲，月乎，其將引余爲知己乎！</p>

<p>作畫泛論</p>
<p>菊花呈球形，或球形的一部，故爲平面的或立體的輻射狀，畫者把握此點，即得其大槪了。</p>
<p>菊花種類萬變，分析之不出下列數種</p>
<p>一·瓣狀菊花的花頭以瓣狀者爲其基本狀態。下端爲管狀，但甚短，不易見。</p>
<p>二·管狀　菊瓣的管形延長，不現瓣形，而見其管中顏色，大體管內較管外色深。</p>
<p>三·唇狀長管之端開出瓣狀，其色多與管色不同，有管長唇短者，有管短唇長者。</p>
<p>四·針狀管口閉合而細長者，即成針形，如此針球作盡較難，用以與厚重花頭配合，別有風趣。</p>
<p>五·絲狀。單瓣而細長者，名爲絲，稀有名貴，爲中國老種。</p>
<p>六·卷狀唇瓣之向內捲者，有名爲「萬卷書」一種，甚美，圖中右下角「佛頭螺髻」，管色黃，唇之內部赤色。</p>
<p>七·添毛欲出奇致勝，瓣上生毛，稱毛菊，亦稱刺菊，紅黃紫各色均有。</p>
<p>八·點染更有在瓣上加點者，如「楓葉蘆花」一種，即在紅花上加白色斑點。</p>
<p>除此八種以外，尚有一種變化，即花心進化的變態，所謂「托桂」，在畫中亦有趣味。</p>
<p>菊花顏色以白黃紅三色爲基本，花未開時，可在葉色上辨別此三大類。至於瓣的粗細，亦與葉的粗細一貫。菊葉較菊花更爲難晝。</p>
<p>其她綠菊價值最貴，性亦較纖細。紫橙等色則爲基本三色之變化。所謂墨色者不過最深的紅紫而已。革於瓣的構成，有瓢彩，有曲綫，有噴射有垂絲，有旋轉，種種變化，增加花形繁複。</p>
<p>插圖所示，皆係北平清華園所培植，民國十四年寫出百餘種，以後每年續有所作。清華園之菊早已無存，未知北平仍多佳種否也。</p>

<p>— 黃樓</p>
<p>清代有兩個北方人洗寓蘇州，而陶冶以成江南的文藝，前者是乾萬間的舒鐵雲，後者至光緒中的鄭叔問。吳中清淑的風土，安雅的人情，真足使人流連陶醉，以達成其形而上的造詣。至今還令人神往而不自覺。</p>
<p>舒鐵雲娶的是吳人，與秀水王仲瞿是親眷，其夫人也是能文的，鐵雲的瓶水齊詩集中寄女牀山人諸作情致纏綿，可想見其閨房中之雅人深致。他從軍貴州的時候，有一個美貌的苗女，名叫龍么妹，據說長官有意給他做妾，他不肯要。貴州苗女被官兵俘虜去作奴婢姬妾，本是當時狠普通的事，兒女英雄傳裏所描寫的長姐，身長皮黑，狠與黔西的人種相近，或者就是水西安氏的部族，殊朱可知。兒女英雄傳的小說技術雖不見怎樣高超，而所描寫的，倒確是現實的社會狀況，這是別的小說所不及的。鐵雲一榜之後，艱於進取，反而狠得些江湖散人的樂趣，大槪受夫人的影響，能說吳語，所以沾染了崑曲的嗜好，居近垂虹亭，自然也有小紅低唱我吹蕭的豪情勝槪。我曾經看見過他親筆寫的詞曲稿，小楷寫在紅格子上，字非常工秀而蘊籍，已經有點道光年閒的派頭。三吳的人士都是風流自賞富於情趣的，一時名俊如孫淵如，孫子瀟，王仲瞿，曹文恪，乃至稍晚而作寓公的張船山，都喜歡講伉儷之樂。在別處卻不甚多見。</p>
<p>鄭叔問本是漢軍旗人，在蘇州作名幕，作名士，作名醫，娶吳姬，築精舍，購究金石字畫藏書文玩花石陶磁飲食，無一不當行出色，尤以詞曲書畫擅名一時，當代公卿士大夫無不與之往還，斂手交推，他的能享各而又能享福，恐怕近幾十年來是無兩的。風致有點像元末的顧阿瑛，豪富自然不及氣派有點像乾隆中的袁隨園，品格卻似過之。也可算得一個奇人了。大凡旗人見的世面多，於人生的享受是向來曾考究的，況且他是世家，況且他又卜居在一個安閒穠冶的吳下，況且他又富有學問與天才，這種造詣不是容易會合成的。清雅是一種奇福，要有其時有其地有其命，還要有共素養與才能。而且這種清雅之福是轉盼消失不容易維持長久的，不但一代無幾人，就是一生也不知有幾日，他的謝世已在民國以後，北京大學曾經以四百元之厚俸請他掌教而未果，但是晚年江關蕭瑟之感也可想而知。</p>
<p>大槪他習慣於燕都的舊家房屋構造，所以所居的齊王象堪是曲折深邃，玲瓏透達的一所書齊，庚子山所謂連關洞房，可以想像其小巧的結構。這種居室最宜於起居，冬季可以避風而藏暖，夏日映着窗前的森森梧竹，畏景不侵，紅塵不到，自然滿室陰涼，如在古洞穴之中。又便於收藏，手頭應用的書籍卷冊文其香茗酒具乃至居家不可少的藥餌衣服被褥鐪扇，都可以如取如攜，得心應手。尤其趣味廣博的人，必須有好幾間設備不同的房室，一處藏書，便於著述、紙筆凌亂，卻也無妨。臨池作畫則必須窗明几凈，長案之上羅列絹素筆硯水盂，牆壁宜素淨宜稍高以便掛畫軸，至於間暇燕息，與三數友人談心，又須設有奇石名卉，佐以茗桃香鑪，琴簫某局隨意可取以爲玩。諸如此類，布置都須意匠經營。</p>
<p>近年曾於友人齊頭見其手繪簾底吹笙花影淡黃月詞意一小軸，畫一姬背面含簧坐一湖石磴上，朱闌曲曲，纖草被於足下，丹桂一枝旁挺，襯以翠竹數叢，遙對一規形之窗，窗中香篆縷樓，壁懸錦囊貯琴，天邊淡色烘出一月，令人有廣寒縹渺之感。著筆無多，荒率中仍見細膩，蓋爲某姬人而寫也。此種高簡筆墨，常於占人中求之。</p>

<p>泛湖</p>
<p>杭州的黃包車相當便宜，我在城站下車，討到省政府代價一千元，後來朋友說，還因爲我是「生張」的緣故，實際五百元可以成交了。細雨之後，路上還是泥濘，車拉過曲折的深巷，白粉牆，黑瓦簾，我似乎走對鄉村了。雖同時驚嘆着這一馳名的都市會保留如此風味，但在我接觸而感覺到的卻特別親切，除了中心的幾條街道外，杭州畢竟不曾洋化得「虛有其表」。</p>
<p>我和宗恩向着洲隄的路上走去，往來的汽車很少，大着膽走去，吉普的亂闖狀態在這裏更不有的。面前，飄拂着幾條柳絲，稀疏的蔭覆遍下而狹長的曲水，路名標着「浣溪路」，那麼，這是浣紗溪了。浣紗溪，誰都知道爲四施浣紗處，不過地點應該屬於紹興縣，原名若耶溪，大槪杭州是越都的關係，就近紀念也未爲不可，但是一灣曲水，淺淤得可以，遣韻難尋，又有點惘然了。過了浣溪路，就到湖濱了，我極目去望西湖的面積，無際涯似的，映帶着蘇白二堤，如果它真的是古美人西予，那遠遠隱現那南北二峯，正是她的雙髻，自然，幻像得太荒唐了。這得怪東坡老人不知怎麼地唱了「若把西湖比西子」一句詩，後人眼中卻拿「若把」換了「簡直」。我以爲西湖要比美人，比一個抽象的美人，「彼美人兮西方之人兮」的美人，詩作者懷念西國盛治的興辭，這樣比較有意思。最好把西湖比一面鏡子，一面空懸着照盡人世間一切善惡的大鏡子，也可以說是一般人口中的「明鏡高懸」的明鏡，按宋史並不是明鏡高懸，而是「虛堂懸鏡」有陳良翰做端安縣令，百姓相稱「公此心如虛堂懸鏡耳！」我們經過了八年的洪爐，所陶冶下來的究竟怎樣？會不會愧對西湖的懸鏡！在夕陽光中，我們雇了一隻船，輕泛着湖面。</p>
<p>十年不見山靈而，</p>
<p>又向浣紗溪上過；</p>
<p>湖色明如良翰鏡，</p>
<p>照人肝膽近如何？</p>
<p>倒懸虛鏡三千丈，</p>
<p>稽古風流盡在斯；</p>
<p>誰是西方人可望，</p>
<p>青山如黛與添眉。</p>

<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>（虎弟所使這搶臂觔斗，是「赤手奪械」的方式之一，我從前跟着老師也練習過。破解的方法，只需端準了槍，退後兩步，或向側面跳開一二步，仍舊可以用槍罩住敵人。我想這個方式，雖被西洋偵探及戰鬥員採用，恐怕仍是我國的國術拳腳化出，因爲沒有國術根底，任是如何苦練，也弄不到很佳的效果。爲什麽要槍背觔斗呢？一者出敵人不意，叫他先吃一驚；二者躲避對方發槍，任你伏身閃避，沒有搶背觔斗這樣神奇，且可真接顧到敵人身前。單單可惜今天這個傢伙不是內行，一時呆住，所以虎弟得以行所無事，把他解決。要是他學過這一招，往後撤退。或往旁閃開，我知道虎弟必有更精采的拳腳，表演出來。不過，使用這槍背觔斗之前，必須顧到三個條件：一，對方敵人，有在我可能達到的距離範開以內；二，須警喏奪械手法，否則即使槍過去了，也是無益，反有大害；三，自己精力，不能完全使在槍背觔斗上，必須顧到從地上躍起之後的爭鬥，這種爭鬥，不僅限於奪過敵人器械，最好是有一二下殺手，在這時候，絕不保留的儘量旅展，這是性命相搏的玩意，不是你死，就是我亡，無法客氣。）</p>
<p>只在虎弟這一　之下，那麼高大的個子，排山似的，倒在地上，喉嚨裏咕噥想叫叫不出，只兩手抱在傷處，拼命掙扎，兩變腳亂蹬亂踢。虎弟也沒管他是四是活，撈住那傢伙的衣領，拖起來往汽油區裏便跑。我這時看得有些怔了．虎弟一跑動，我才驚覺過來，忙把我同虎弟的手槍抬起，插在腰裏，又把那隻手提機關抓起來，防備敵人趕上，可以抵檔一陣；一邊繞着汽油桶跑過去，一邊悄聲警告虎弟，叫他快跟我走。那地上的火繩正燃着，燒剩沒有多少了。同時還似乎聽得狗羣，已向這裏跑來了。</p>
<p>我們越過了重重陣碍，渡過了溪水的當口，魔窟的汽油區已經起火，不到一會，火勢大了，想已燒到了油桶地方，還聽見呯嘭爆炸的聲響。這時虎弟提着那二三十磅重的手提機槍，我左右乎都是德式的二十響，（一把是虎弟的），三五個人，倒不怕他，但因恐大隊追踪，我們不敢上大路，只在荒場土丘上，高一步，低一步斜插走去。約莫走了五六里遠近，回顧看看，那火場仍舊烈煙飛騰，半邊天都照得通紅，那二千多桶汽油，大槪可以涓滴不賸。苒跑了一二里，猛須聽得「轟」的一聲巨響，緊接一陣呯呯嘭嘭的爆炸，真有震撼山岳的情勢。</p>
<p>「咦！」我們同時停了步，回頭一看，只　一陣濃煙。向半空捲起，下面托着一層黃霧，緊接就有約莫一畝多地寬擴的一陣火光，直沖天空。火光一剎即過，那巨響的餘聲，還在耳鼓振蕩着，那燃燒的地方，卻是煙消火殫，一切復歸寂靜。</p>

<p>當汪逆繢衛竊據南京時，周逆佛海匪陳逆公博，實爲其左右手。周逆懷抱野心，有取而代之之意；故號召　類，組織偽稅警團，以培養其勢力，同時以其兼任偽財長，財政權在其掌握，更造成其無惡不作之罪業。當其狐假虎威，橫行一世之時，其他姑從緩議，即以其發行偽券一事言之，即已殺不足恕，將我渝陷區人民之財產，無形中加以對折，傾家蕩產者，舉目皆是。此種損失，不殺周逆，將向誰清算？徒以我國人，一向重情感，而輕於是非，且又健忘成性，眼見此一代之漢奸，昔日炙手可熟者，今日居然屈伏於莊嚴國法之下，不免有流淚乞憐之態，於是將其昔日罪惡，一旦盡忘，轉有加以憐憫。信其丑表菌之無稽亂語，謂宜加以寬恕者。平心言之，周逆而得倖免，不特我抗戰烈士，將扼腕嘆息於九泉之下。即陳逆公博輩，死而有知，覩此同罪異罰，我知其亦將呼寃不已也！</p>
<p>周逆之罪狀，據起訴書所提出，計有十款：偶犯其一，即已殺不可恕，況以一人之身，兼而有之，判匪死刑，實屬情罪允當；然周逆尚有一罪，未經列入，即其主持特工，慘殺忠貞是也。今日言「七十六號」者，對於丁逆默邨，李逆上羣，吳逆世賓等等，莫不怨恨入骨，不知凡此諸逆，無一非周逆所栽培，所撮携，所養成，即如中行別業行員集體被綁一案，李吳諸逆，雖作走狗，而發號司令者，實爲周逆。此其明證也。如此陰險慘毒之人，一死豈足以敝其辜？倘得予以槍決，在周逆本人言之，尚屬極大之便宜也！</p>
<p>又周逆之妻楊逆　淑，當日固憑借惡勢，囤貨居奇，公開賣官，肆行搜括。勝利後聽其逍遙法外，奔走滬港各地，爲乃夫營救。某小報又載其在蘇放高利貸，雖罪不及孥，法所規定，但此奸婆本身，即已罪惡叢集，固當令其與葉逆吉卿佘逆愛珍，同其命運，不當令其倖逃法綱也！</p>
<p>本年二月間，主座蔣公來滬，倖會上　言事，主張所捕各漢奸，應從速開審宣判；四月初接其覆示，謂已送交主管機關，迅予查明辦理。當時見周逆尚覇押重慶，擬再函請押京法辦，旋報張已傳，謂周逆即將解京，是以忍而未發。乃此次判處死刑後，頗有可能減刑之說，我真不解週逆何修而得此。爲表示公憤計，故不避瑣碎，作爲此文。想淪陷區諸同胞中，當必有首肯我說者，希一致主張，萬不可令此一代巨奸，得倖逃赤戮也！（卻酬）</p>

<p>當喪家爲死者立起一塊牌位的時候，凡是染有封建思想的子女，他們往往總喜歡晉父親冠着「顯考」，而晉母親冠着「顯妣」，好像聊增哀樂？如果這死者在生前確實做過一番偉大事業，有益國家，并且揚名聲，顯父母；那末冠上了顯赤妣兩字，還算得名符其實。但是有許多死者，生前爲人平平凡凡，毫無建樹，如果行爲清白，於人雖無福，但也無禍，也就帶帶過去。</p>
<p>獨有十三日看見和平日報一位女記者訪問稿裏說起，她在海格路中國殯儀館裏訪問老牌漢奸梁逆鴻志的妻子　意女士（他報作　貞）時，覺很景況非常凄涼，桌子上放了一塊牌位，上面寫着：「顯考梁公眾異府君子靈位」這不是笑話奇談嗎？</p>
<p>梁逆鴻志組織過維新政府，當然也是通謀敵國，圖謀反抗本國的大漢奸，禍國殃民的罪行，也可以說是人神共憤，現在已經槍決，人心稱快。他妻子還說：「我們夫婦感情最好，我是跟他吃過苦的」。做着叛國的舉動，不知歡諫，那末「跟他吃過苦」，當然是咎由自取了；真枉爲世代書香　而今還替他在牌位上冠着「顯考」兩個字，未免恬不知恥！他究竟「顯」了什麼呢？</p>
<p>至於梁逆自名「眾異」，也覺得可笑，到今日才知道他所以名爲「眾異」者，就是說明他甘心幹的叛國舉動，這一點，確實是與「眾」人相「異」的地方。</p>

<p>— ]胡言</p>
<p>大上海市的計劃已在研究中了。東至浦東，南至南匯，西至龍華，北至江灣大場，在計劃中的大上海是個人口一千五百萬的世界第一流都市，浦江上游，建築起活動橋樑，下游開　地下隧道，車水馬龍，熙來攘往，真是美極了！</p>
<p>然而我們要知道，計劃是最終的目的，實現計劃卻要一步步漸次推進，都市的擴展，正如水之就地，先有涓涓的細流，向四面蜿蜒，然後膨脹彙集，形成一個像樣的河流或是池沼。都市的擴展，第一有賴於交通路綫的延長第二有賴於保安警力的擴大。</p>
<p>從前我們政府爲了要在租界以外，建立起一個像樣的，自己的上海，曾經化了許多錢鈔，建造起新上海，那時的計劃，不能不說是雄偉，那時的憧憬，不能不說是美麗，然而計劃畢竟是計劃，憧憬畢竟是憧憬，上海人夢想了許久的新都市中心，直到現在，還是沒有繁盛熱鬧起來，而其中最主要的問題，卻還是交通與治安。（此之謂治安，主要是指求社會根本的安定，警力之充實不過治標之道耳。）</p>
<p>如果現在土山灣附近的那條臭水河—陸家浜，已經填沒，如果林森路的電車延長到漕河涇，或是漕河涇到上海間每十分鐘有一班公共汽車，如果市站到龍華，莘莊，甚至松江間的鐵道，已經改成汽車道，滬杭甬綫的火車改以松江；爲終點如果龍華漕河涇的警察分駐所都改成警力充沛的警察分局，保證廠商居民的安全，我看不出大上海市的發展，會在南方受到甚麼障礙。</p>
<p>向北呢，如果京滬綫的終點，改在南翔或真如，這鐵道再向南迤西，和松江相接，那末上海市的北極區域，已無形中擴展至南翔，真如，客貨經由輕便小火車，或是公共汽車運向市中心區，來往的頻繁，更間接的促進了市面的繁榮。</p>
<p>我認爲，上海市以浦東作爲住宅區，是浪費的，浦東這臨海帶江的地方，將更適宜爲工廠倉庫之用。</p>
<p>向南，向西，向北，上海市的發展，是無限的，但是我們要注意交通，更要注意治安；江灣本可以作上海的本部，那兒有學校，有工廠，但是因爲江灣與上海中間地區的治安，沒有極好的保證，江灣直到現在，還不過是一個市鎮呢。</p>

<p>「不，下次再談罷」。</p>
<p>「那麼，星期一罷，同樣的時間」。</p>
<p>「好罷，我一定記得把這條棍子送還你的，魯遜伸出手來，說，「米恩，再會罷」。</p>

<p>「對的，他們總不肯講明什麼東西。但是他們很希望你去一趟」。</p>
<p>「那個傢伙一定又偷了一隻香煙盒」，米恩說，「但是，我還是走一趟，看看罷」。</p>

<p>「唔，她的情形并不佳妙，但是她還活着。你說你不是醫生嗎」？</p>
<p>「不是醫生，我是一個心理分析家」。</p>
<p>「但是，你不是正在醫治魯遜嗎？你一定知道他的心理情形和一切的」。</p>
<p>「是的，我統統知道的。她還有希望活下去嗎」？</p>
<p>警長縮一縮肩頭，說：「她吃了四顆子彈，這個可憐的孩子啊」！</p>
<p>「他用手槍打她嗎」？</p>
<p>警長對米恩看看，問：「是的，爲什麼你這樣問呢」？</p>
<p>「我覺得很詫異，這件事情會這樣發生的」。</p>
<p>「但是他的確幹了這樣事情，一點也用不着奇怪的呀」？</p>
<p>米恩的眼睛和警長的視綫一接觸的時候，他突然振慄起來，覺得他不應該這樣講法。他於是搖搖頭，表示疑惑的樣子，并不回答什麼。（未完）</p>

<h3 id="c204">風雅的將軍　白崇禧 <a href="#c204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>— 甘來</p>
<p>白崇禧和他的綽號「小諱萬」，早經名播全國，用不着多作介紹。將軍身材魁梧，髪脫頂禿，光　　的一片頭皮，配上高大的體軀，望去恰似一支粗銅柱。公歷一八九三年他生於廣西桂林，現年五十三歲，民國五年在保定軍官學校第三期步兵科畢業，白氏出身雖爲軍人，待人接物卻溫和可親，說話時嘴角常掛着微笑，談到高興，縱聲一笑，聲音朗爽，聽了使人覺得愉快。</p>
<p>當第四集團軍副總司令任內，他留駐廣西，與李宗仁氏共同主持桂省施政建設，舉辦公民軍事訓練，所以文萊過去曾有「全省皆兵」的佳譽。抗戰期中，白將軍任副參謀總長兼軍訓部長，回廣西視察時，值桂省瘴疫流行，士卒病倒累累，將軍素習醫學，便即親擬治痢，治瘧良方，付印分發各部隊應用。藥方是：治痢—白芍六錢，　　子二錢，枳壳二分，車前子六分，當歸六錢，甘草八分，檳榔六分。治瘧—馬梅，常山，　甲，檳榔，紅棗，甘草各三錢，生　三片。據說頗見功效，原來白將軍不僅是良將，并且還是一位良醫。</p>
<p>白氏頗懂得幽默，并且知道它是調劑嚴肅的軍人生活唯一的良藥。在若干年前，曾任外交部長，司法行政部長的羅文幹氏，曾往廣西遊歷，白將軍對羅氏的學問修養，素所欽敬，便替他設宴洗塵，并當眾致介紹辭：「羅部長溫文爾雅」，夙有「小姐」外號，現在不遠千里光臨，必有一番妙論，至盼在座睹君，屏氣靜聽…」</p>
<p>白將軍的「足智多謀」，固然由於他的天聰過人，據說一半卻是得力於他過去的幕僚，這四個小智囊是：張定璠，王公度，劉維章，潘宜之。張氏過去曾任上海市長，最得白氏倚重。白將軍從前不大喜歡接近新聞記者，但是最近他已經懂得怎樣應付記者們的巧妙言辭了。</p>
<p>星期雜談　婚禮儀式討論</p>
<h3 id="c205">老生常談 <a href="#c205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>— 洪因</p>
<p>近年來婚禮儀式的蛻變，原因有二：</p>
<p>舊禮教的崩潰，庸俗陋規的死亡，使婚禮必須有個新形式，此其一；</p>
<p>國民經濟情形不佳，社會不安定，使婚禮儀式不能不因陋就簡，此其二。</p>
<p>由於這二項主要因素，近年婚禮儀式五花八門，各有一套；從好的方面說，社會風氣已漸趨力求實際，不作「面子」上的過分舖張；從壞的方面說，一般婚禮失之草率雜亂，形成大家對儀式的輕視，因之結之容易，離之亦容易，不能有益於社會的安定。</p>
<p>照目前的形勢觀，婚禮儀式除了宗教式以外，難以有個定型，只能依各人的經濟力量及愛好，自行決定其詳細的方式。不過，如果就事論事，力求近乎情理，則結婚之儀式的決定，還不能推翻一般人所認爲對的兩大原則：簡單而隆重。這雖然是老調，但卻是最明達的主張。</p>
<p>我認爲成家如同創業，不必標新立異，不必故作驚人，也無須勉強舖張，取快於一時！法律的儀式，無可省勉，婚禮中的氣氛（包括音樂·服裝·組織…）必須表現得有條理，莊嚴，熱烈，簡單。而另一方面，如同證書的詞句，報上的廣告，喜柬的內容等，則無妨用白話文，用更有意義的字句，不必傳習千年來的老套！這表現這對新夫婦，對社會舊規陋習，有改革精神。此外，種種迷信舉動，新夫婦應該以堅決的態度，一槪取消，不必取妥協的態度。</p>
<p>對於一雙新婚伉儷，我們希望他（她）們對於儀式有深刻的印象，認識結婚的社會意義，另方面，在力求簡單的儀式裏，我們希望他（她）們認識：這「簡單」的意義是，一切實事求是，不作噱頭的虛張聲勢，不因個人結婚而消耗掉許多社會的物力人力！結婚是創業的起點，對於婚禮的處理，正表現其此後對事業的態度！</p>
<h3 id="c206">集團結婚 <a href="#c206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>— 頑石</p>
<p>我所理想的結婚儀式就是主張採取現行的「集團結婚」儀式，下面就是我的幾點理由：</p>
<p>（一）集團結婚的儀式，旣不過份簡單，又不過份麻煩。（二）我認爲結婚可不必十分注重儀式，集團生活在儀式上當然是比不上「老法」或「新法」結婚的隆重，但是卻來得實際。（三）集團結婚儀式旣可節省金錢，又可減少時間。（四）集團結婚是大眾化的，不分寶貴貧賤，人人可享受到這種結婚儀式。</p>
<h3 id="c207">實事求是 <a href="#c207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>— 李鳳池</p>
<p>結婚的儀式，以前雖少變化，然而從遜清末葉到現在，卻不知變了多少花綠。千句併一句，乃是由繁冗而至簡便。記得幼時跟家長到親戚家吃喜酒，一吃總得五六天，那時的習慣，雖是中人之家辦喜事，起碼要忙四五天，巨宦富商，一場喜事忙上半月二旬，亦是常有的事，遠道新戚，在好多天前已經登門道賀了。</p>
<p>這樣的舖張不能謂爲沒有其安定男女關係的用意，但在民窮世亂的今日，有錢的舖張婚禮是他的自由，無錢的則實不必硬充「大亨」，致使婚後負債累累，來日對不起後一代的小寳寳們，也對不起自己！</p>
<h3 id="c208">舉行舞會 <a href="#c208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>我主張：除了法定的儀式不可免掉外，其餘詳細的方式，應聽憑新婚伉儷的自由決定。喜歡舞蹈音樂的，不妨在儀式之同時，舉行舞會，舉行音樂演奏，使大家盡歡而散。舞會·音樂行之得當，并不浪費財力！</p>
<h3 id="c209">說老實話 <a href="#c209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>— 沙</p>
<p>青年們對結婚儀式，最易持偏激態度，我以爲結婚本身是一種最平凡簡單的事情，不必在儀式上力求與眾不同。如果要表示超脫不凡，你不結婚好了！不結婚，真正的獨身，確是不「庸凡」的！</p>

<h3 id="e1">Government Actively Reorganizing During National Assembly Meeting; Democratic Socialist Party Submits List <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 16th] Zheng Dang, Secretary-General of the Political Consultative Conference, flew to Shanghai on the afternoon of the 15th to consult with Zhang Junmai, Li Huang, Zhang Qun, and others, and returned to Nanjing at 4:30 PM on the 16th. In the evening, when Lei met with reporters, he did not explain the mission to Shanghai, only answering the reporter's inquiries as follows: (1) The National Government Committee is about to be reorganized and is currently under preparation. The number of committee members from the Communist Party and the Democratic League will be reserved. (2) The rumor that the reorganized government will have eighteen ministries is not accurate. (3) The reorganization of the Executive Yuan will be handled after the National Assembly concludes, due to timing issues.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 16th] Shao Lizi, the chief representative of the peace negotiation government, told United Press reporters today: There is no longer any problem with the Democratic Socialist Party participating in the National Assembly. Shao said: Zhang Junmai, leader of the Democratic Socialist Party, returned to Nanjing after going to Shanghai to discuss with members of his party, and submitted four suggestions before participating in the National Assembly, requesting the government to accept them. According to Shao, these suggestions include the following points: (1) The government reiterates its policy of resolving the Communist Party issue peacefully; (2) The government should allow the full realization of civil liberties, including freedom of speech, publication, assembly, and association; (3) The government should remove party branches and youth league activities from all schools. Shao said: These suggestions are "acceptable" to the government, and the implementation details are being drafted. This issue is expected to be resolved soon. Shao also revealed: The government is preparing to reorganize, including the National Government Council and the Executive Yuan, and this reorganization will be implemented during the National Assembly meeting. Wu Tiecheng also stated: The Kuomintang is preparing to reorganize the government.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 16th] Zhang Qun arrived in Nanjing at 7:15 AM on the 16th on the Nanjing-Shanghai train. Among those traveling with him were Meng Xianzhang and six other representatives from Hubei. Because Zhang arrived very early, very few people came to welcome him. After getting off the train, he took Wu Tiecheng's car to Wu's residence. At 10:00 AM, Wu Dingchang visited him, followed by an audience with the Chairman, and then a visit to Song Ziwen. In the afternoon at 4:00 PM, Li Zongren visited him. At 5:00 PM, he accepted Zhang Jiaao's invitation to meet with Zhang Junmai on Tianzhu Road and discussed everything. In the evening, he accepted Special Envoy Marshall's invitation to dinner. There are rumors that Zhang will be transferred to the position of Secretary-General, although this has not been officially confirmed, but it is quite possible.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Youth Party Representatives Register; Zhang Junmai and Others Fly to Nanjing; Democratic League to Express Attitude Soon <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 16th] After the list of Youth Party National Assembly representatives was announced on the morning of the 16th, Zeng Qi, Chen Qitian, Zuo Shunsheng, and 19 others registered on the 16th. Li Huang remained in Shanghai due to illness and will return to Nanjing on the 17th. Also, 30 National Assembly representatives registered on the 16th, bringing the total to 1445, including 19 Youth Party representatives.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 16th] When reporters asked Minister Peng Xuepei for his opinion on the remarks made by Youth Party leader Zuo Shunsheng, he replied: Mr. Zuo's remarks are logically rigorous. He said that only by unanimously participating in the National Assembly can peace be maintained, unity be promoted, and a constitution supported by the whole country be created to protect the people's livelihood. His theory is simple and clear, which shows that right and wrong and justice cannot be covered up by intimidation and propaganda tactics.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 16th] Zhang Junmai, leader of the Democratic Socialist Party, along with nine party officials including Jiang Yuntian and Sun Baogang, flew from Shanghai to Nanjing at 4:30 PM on the 16th. It is reported that the list of the Democratic Socialist Party has already been drafted and can be submitted immediately. The National Government may convene a selection committee immediately to approve it. Tonight, reporters inquired about the Democratic League's thoughts on the participation of the Youth Party and the Democratic Socialist Party in the National Assembly. Luo Longji replied that he had no opinion to express, but he intends to receive reporters in the next few days to express his attitude. The area in front of the Lan Family Villa has become deserted.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Zhang Junmai, leader of the Democratic Socialist Party, came to Shanghai again on the morning of the 15th. On the mornings of the 15th and 16th, he continued to hold meetings with party cadres here to discuss participation in the National Assembly and the party's future issues. As a result of the discussions, the party hopes that the government authorities will accept the demands it has put forward before immediately submitting the list for the National Assembly. Zhang took a plane back to Nanjing in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Reporters visited Sun Baoyi, the spokesperson for the party, last night, who stated: "Our party has not yet submitted a list of National Assembly representatives and hopes that the government can continue to negotiate with the Chinese Communist Party so that the current situation does not worsen further." He also stated: "The party has requested that the National Assembly be postponed and implemented in accordance with the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference before nominating a list. Among them, the postponement of the National Assembly is now a thing of the past. However, we still hope that the government will accept the part about reorganizing the government and drafting the constitution. Some important clauses in the draft constitution, such as the Executive Yuan being responsible to the Legislative Yuan and the scope of the Executive Yuan's powers, have not yet been decided, and we hope the government will adopt them."</p>
<p>Sun also stated that the relationship between the Democratic League and the Democratic Socialist Party has always been very close. All proposals of the Democratic League are jointly decided by the Democratic Socialist Party, but the actions of the Democratic Socialist Party are not bound by the Democratic League. The Democratic Socialist Party has always hoped to take consistent actions with the Democratic League and echo each other. However, in special circumstances, the Democratic Socialist Party can also act freely and is not bound by the Democratic League. Huang Yanpei of the Democratic League recently returned to Shanghai from Nanjing, and Shen Junru also came after him, but Luo Longji is still in Nanjing.</p>
<p>The Chinese Communist Party authorities have not made any statement regarding the Democratic Socialist Party recently. Zhang Junmai's visit may be to discuss with Zhou Enlai. Zhou has not returned to Yan'an due to a plane delay, but Dong Biwu remains in Nanjing, creating a lingering connection. There may still be a turning point in the overall situation.</p>
<h3 id="e3">Representatives to the National Assembly from Hebei <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Appeal for Relief for the Disaster in Hebei</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 16th] National Assembly representatives from Hebei Province, Han Da, Li Huadong, Liu Yaozhang, etc., took the opportunity of attending the National Assembly to make appeals for urgent relief to the disaster victims in Hebei in recent days. Yesterday afternoon, they sent Zhang Yinwu, Li Sizong, and three others to the Executive Yuan to petition. Because Premier Song was out, Secretary-General Jiang received them on his behalf. After the representatives tearfully described the dire situation of the people in Hebei, Jiang promised to forward the report to Premier Song and try to allocate relief funds as soon as possible to provide urgent relief.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 16th] The National Government issued an order on the 16th, listing the names of the National Assembly representatives whose registration has been canceled for various reasons, and who are being replaced by alternates or supplements. This order. Shao Shenting of the Dalian Occupational Groups was unable to attend in Nanjing for some reason, and was replaced by Zhang Baozi. Lü Lefu of the Xinjiang Mongolian Tribe resigned and was replaced by Qiao Jiafu. Hu Shuhua, a civil engineer in the free occupation group, was elected as a representative of the social elite, and was replaced by Xu Enzeng.</p>
<h3 id="e4">China Labor Association <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>Supports the Convening of the National Assembly</p>
<p>Opposes the Communist Party's Separatist Militarism</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City] The China Labor Association, in support of convening the National Assembly and opposition to the Communist Party's separatist militarism, telegraphed to the Nanjing National Assembly representatives, stating: This time, the government has shown forbearance for the country, promulgated a ceasefire order, and repeatedly postponed the meeting, its painstaking efforts are evident to the world. Our association is a national labor organization, established for more than ten years, with the purpose of studying labor theory based on the Three Principles of the People, coordinating labor welfare, and promoting the labor movement. During the War of Resistance, it also participated in military work to assist the government. From now on, it will adhere to its original intention to implement the labor policy of the Three Principles of the People, contact international workers, and continue to work to improve labor culture and increase labor welfare. Communism is not suitable for China's national conditions, which is clear in the teachings of the Founding Father. The Communist Party's despicable, brutal, and undemocratic style is especially unsuitable for the peace-loving and freedom-loving Chinese nation. We believe that today's China must implement constitutionalism, and the implementation of constitutionalism must be promulgated with a constitution. The promulgation of a constitution requires convening a National Assembly. To seek peaceful reconstruction of the country, the military must be nationalized. The Communist Party's separatist militarism is a major obstacle to peaceful unification. Because if the military is not nationalized for a day, wars will continue, and there will be no peace. We, at this time of national success or failure, must work together and bravely move towards the path of national construction, bringing the country to a state of prosperity, strength, and well-being, and elevating the people to a comfortable life. If any party, disregarding the suffering of the people and the interests of the nation, dares to defy the world and disrupt the National Assembly and engage in separatist rebellions, it will be the public enemy of the people of the whole country. On the occasion of the opening of the conference, we sincerely send this telegram to the representatives, hoping you will be informed, China Labor Association, 15th.</p>

<p>Occupational Representatives Draft Proposal</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 16th] This National Assembly's occupational representatives, because the Five-Five Draft Constitution and its revised draft do not contain provisions related to occupational representatives, have gone to the Ministry of Social Affairs to solicit opinions. Minister Gu Zhenggang hosted a tea party on the 16th to invite representatives of various occupational groups to collectively discuss common opinions. Minister Gu first stated that the current occupational representatives account for about one-third of the total number of representatives. The future constitution should have provisions for the number of their representatives and the method of their creation. He also said: "The Ministry has worked with experts to formulate a plan to add a 'Social Security' chapter to the constitution to stabilize society, consolidate the foundation of the country, meet national requirements, and adapt to the spirit of the times." He also asked the representatives attending the meeting to contribute their opinions. The representatives spoke enthusiastically, discussed repeatedly, and agreed that it was necessary to strive for this in the National Assembly. Finally, Tang Qiyu, Li Hongru, Wu Yun, Hu Shuhua, and 12 others, as well as a representative from Xinjiang Heyuan, were selected to form a drafting committee to draft proposals for submission to the National Assembly.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 16th] US Ambassador Stuart flew from Nanjing to Beiping on Marshall's special plane at 4:00 PM on the 16th. Chuan Jingbo said: "The ambassador is homesick, so he came back to see." The ambassador's health seems to be better than the last time he returned to Beiping, but his mood seems to be covered by a deeper shadow. Someone asked him if there was still a glimmer of hope for peace, and he said: "I don't know, but I will always have hope for China." He told reporters that rumors of Marshall returning to the US are false.</p>

<h3 id="e9">Zhou Enlai's Written Statement <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 16th] Zhou Enlai of the Chinese Communist Party delegation held a press conference at 2:30 PM on the 16th and issued a written statement, stating that there was nothing else to explain besides this. Then the reporters raised questions, and Zhou answered them one by one, and the meeting ended at about 4:00 PM. The full text of his written statement is as follows: The National Assembly unilaterally organized by the Kuomintang government opened yesterday. This National Assembly was convened unilaterally by a one-party government, violating the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference and the national will. The Chinese Communist Party firmly opposes it. Not only was the date of this National Assembly not agreed upon by the Political Consultative Conference, but more importantly, it is a divisive National Assembly convened by one party, not a united National Assembly attended by all parties. According to the resolutions and procedures and spirit of the Political Consultative Conference, the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference must be implemented in turn, and it can be convened under the leadership of the reorganized government.</p>
<p>The various resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference are the temporary constitution agreed upon by all parties, and it is a whole that cannot be divided. In the past ten months, the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference have not only not been implemented in the slightest, but have been completely destroyed by the Kuomintang authorities. The ceasefire agreement was approved by the Political Consultative Conference, but the civil war has spread from Northeast China to inside the passes. The government authorities have thoroughly destroyed the authority of the January ceasefire order. The four promises announced by the government authorities at the opening of the Political Consultative Conference, from the Datangzi massacre to the Li Wen assassination case, have been completely destroyed by the Kuomintang secret service rule. The reorganization of the government has not yet been agreed upon, and the program for peaceful national reconstruction cannot be implemented. For the local governments in many liberated areas, the Kuomintang authorities not only do not allow them to maintain the status quo in accordance with the program, but also want to implement "takeover." If they do not agree, they will implement armed occupation. The basic spirit of the military resolution is the separation of military and civilians, but now the governors of the provinces of the Kuomintang government are all filled by active military personnel.</p>
<p>The review of the draft constitution was not completed in Chongqing, and the Communist Party representatives immediately made a full reservation statement. After arriving in Nanjing, the government authorities shelved it until now and never discussed it again. The agreement on the National Assembly issue was a final compromise during the Political Consultative Conference. The Kuomintang authorities guaranteed that they would not convene a divisive National Assembly unilaterally organized by one party, and guaranteed to pass the draft constitution completed by the Political Consultative Conference. Other parties were allowed to reserve representative quotas in regional and occupational representatives among the representatives unilaterally organized by one party for ten years, and the number of party representatives and liberated area representatives must be increased. Only such a National Assembly, which can be attended after the civil war is completely stopped, the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference have been implemented, the people's freedom rights have been guaranteed, and the government has been reorganized, can be called a united National Assembly attended by all parties.</p>
<p>The so-called National Assembly that is now opening not only violates the above-mentioned resolutions and their spirit, but even the date of the meeting or postponement is determined by a one-party government, and the number of representatives is determined by a one-party government. According to the number announced on the morning of November 15, it has reached 1,580, which has encroached on the 410 representatives of other parties in the original agreement of 2,050 people, especially the quota of 200 representatives in the liberated areas, as many as 140 people. It can be seen that this National Assembly is a divisive National Assembly unilaterally organized by one party from beginning to end. The so-called leaving vacancies waiting for the CCP to participate is both a destruction of the PCC and a complete deception. In fact, it just wants to deceive other parties besides the CCP to participate in order to embellish the face of the Kuomintang authorities' personal dictatorship. Therefore, in the Nanjing talks in January, through the hard work of third-party people, the CCP has repeatedly proposed that the form of the talks can be flexible, but it must be done in accordance with the resolutions and procedures of the PCC, but they were rejected by the government authorities. The closer the date of the one-party National Assembly, the more we advocate immediately stopping the one-party National Assembly so that the military three-person meeting, the Political Consultative Conference Comprehensive Group, and the Constitution Draft Review Committee can be opened simultaneously.</p>
<p>In accordance with the truce agreement, the troop reduction plan and the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, the current military and political issues should be resolved separately and implemented immediately. Then, in a peaceful environment, a united National Assembly attended by all parties can be convened calmly. However, the government, anxious to embellish the dictatorship, does not consider this at all. The one-party National Assembly that is now opening not only makes the recent propositions of the CCP and the third party in the talks impossible, but also finally destroys all resolutions and the truce agreement and the troop reduction plan since the Political Consultative Conference, cuts off the road of peaceful talks since the Political Consultative Conference, and at the same time quickly and thoroughly exposes the deceptive nature of the government authorities' "ceasefire order" on November 8. This one-party National Assembly also wants to pass the so-called "constitution" to "legalize" the dictatorship and "legalize" the ceasefire. If this continues, the Chinese people will surely fall into a deep abyss of suffering. We Chinese Communists firmly do not recognize this National Assembly. The door to peace talks has been closed by the Kuomintang government authorities. We have no need to consider all the tricks that will be played in the one-party National Assembly, or even the reorganization of the government. Participating in this National Assembly and acknowledging these tricks will inevitably overturn the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference and destroy the track of peace, democracy, unity, and unification since the Political Consultative Conference. There is no middle ground. The bloody battles to attack the liberated areas are in full swing, and the US government's policy of aiding Chiang in the civil war remains unchanged. False peace and false democracy can never deceive people. We Chinese Communists are willing to fight to the end for true peace and true democracy with the Chinese people and all parties that are truly working for democracy.</p>
<h3 id="e10">To Withdraw to Yan'an in Two or Three Days <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>Dong Biwu Will Still Remain in Nanjing</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 16th] Zhou Enlai answered reporters' questions at the press conference on the 16th: 1. The return to Yan'an will be decided in two or three days. More than a dozen people will travel together. When will he come again, he has not considered it yet. The personnel returning to Yan'an this time came because of the past Political Consultative Conference. Dong Biwu will still remain in Nanjing because the office was established at the beginning of the War of Resistance. At the same time, remaining in Nanjing will still maintain contact with the government. The Shanghai office will also still exist. More than a dozen people remain in the Beiping Military Mediation Department under the leadership of Ye Jianying. 2. Whether the liberated areas will convene a people's congress after the National Assembly is convened is not currently under consideration. 3. At present, the government army is launching a tighter attack on Yan'an. Hu Zongnan's troops have mobilized ten brigades and deployed attacks in the south of Yan'an. Ma Hongkui also has five brigades from the west of the Yellow River to the east of the Yellow River. The day after the government issued the ceasefire order, fourteen planes circled over Yan'an, that is, when the military talks were conducted with Special Envoy Marshall and others, two planes also passed over Yan'an. This actually shows that the government still wants to use military action to threaten the Communist Party to participate in the National Assembly, but the Communist Party will never give in. The next action of the government may be to carry out a tentative military offensive action towards Yan'an. I can predict that the government is determined to write to the Yan'an area. This means that the government not only produced a National Assembly that was convened and organized unilaterally by one party, but also prepared to use the offensive in the Yan'an area to block future discussions. The government uses 66% of its military strength in the liberated areas, which is a situation of national offensive. In the Subei area, the government is attacking Yancheng and deploying LianShui and Liyang to continue the offensive behind Yantai on the Shandong Peninsula. On the Pinghan Railway, the government army is moving along the line to both sides. There are also military actions in the Andong and Liaobei areas of Northeast China. Actual military actions have never stopped. 4. The submission of the Youth Party list was expected long ago. 5. The Communist Party believes that the third party's suggestion to postpone the National Assembly is an unwise move, and the government may not adopt it. Nominating to the government for questioning means destroying the PCC resolution and spirit first. The four representatives of the Communist Party made a painful statement at the Jiaotong Bank on the 11th, explaining that the intention was to maintain the position of the PCC. If the government can also maintain it, it is very good. Unfortunately, the National Assembly has been convened, which is tantamount to tearing up the PCC resolution. It is regrettable that the Youth Party also tore it up. 6. The Communist Party's attitude in the future: (1) The CCP's future policy has been determined since Japan surrendered, seeking a peaceful, united, and unified China. This attitude will never change; (2) The method needs to be determined based on the development of the objective situation, and it should be discussed back at the moment; (3) In accordance with the spirit of the PCC resolution, the CCP has made great compromises. Many people opposed the country ten years ago. The PCC has made some compromises, such as the draft constitution, the ceasefire agreement, the four promises, the program for peaceful national reconstruction, and the agreements on the government side. (4) Regarding the National Assembly issue, the government hopes to retain the representatives from ten years ago. The CCP believes that the National Assembly only guarantees the principles of amending the constitution, guarantees the passage of the National Assembly, and at the same time, the PCC resolution can implement government reorganization, and then convene the National Assembly. Only this can be called a National Assembly in which all parties unite to participate. (5) This time, it was convened unilaterally by the government. The CCP will never participate. Ten years of civil war before the War of Resistance, eight years of friction after the War of Resistance, and one year of disputes after victory, twenty years have passed. (6) Yan'an welcomes the Central Daily News and the Central News Agency to go, but no one has ever gone. (7) The government's convening of the National Assembly means breaking up, so I want to go back. (8) The CCP will not give up peace talks, and will resume talks on a new basis. (9) If the government wants to continue the offensive, we will of course resolutely resist.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 16th] Zhou Enlai visited Special Envoy Marshall on the morning of the 16th and expressed his farewell.

<h3 id="e11">Eschew Ease and Luxury, Strive to Avoid Self-Destruction: Chairman Chiang's Admonition to Military Unit Commanders to Labor Together with Soldiers and Share Hardships <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 16th] Chairman Chiang yesterday telegraphed all unit commanders nationwide, earnestly and sincerely urging them to eschew extravagance, strive to labor alongside their soldiers, share hardships, and maintain a spirit of perseverance and extraordinary fortitude. The full text is as follows: (Titles Omitted) Reports indicate that commanders stationed in provinces and cities often indulge in wanton feasting and extravagant displays, harboring poison without realizing the harm. They neglect their duty to safeguard the nation, merely increasing their daily pleasures, indulging in banquets and neglecting their soldiers for months. How can they bear the weight of the revolution and rescue our people from fire and water? It must be understood that the way to govern an army lies first and foremost in sharing joys and sorrows, and enduring hardships together. Famous generals of old did not wear fur in winter or use fans in summer, nor did they raise umbrellas in the rain. They did not speak of thirst until the army's well was dug, nor of fatigue until the army's tents were pitched, nor of hunger until the army's stoves were lit. Only in this way could they gain the "hearts of their superiors willing to die for them," and achieve the effects of victorious battles and successful conquests. It is now stipulated that each army commander must, every three months, labor alongside soldiers, share meals, deliver incisive training speeches, and personally inspect barracks two or three times; division commanders, two or three times a month; regimental commanders, three times a week; battalion commanders, two or three times; company commanders, two or three times every three days; and platoon leaders must be close to their soldiers every day. Anyone who deliberately violates this will be charged with dereliction of duty. In this way, superiors and subordinates will trust each other like father and son, and the will of the people will become like a fortress. Commanders at all levels must especially restore a simple and unadorned life, maintain a spirit of perseverance and extraordinary fortitude, cast aside vanity and cultivate integrity. "Worry and toil can revitalize a nation, while ease and luxury can lead to self-destruction." These ancient teachings are clear and should not be surpassed. In addition to dispatching personnel for random inspections, this urgent telegram is hereby issued, urging you to diligently implement these instructions and order your subordinates to comply accordingly.</p>

<p>[Our Changchun Dispatch, 15th] Amidst the calls for the National Assembly, the Communist army in the Northeast has disregarded the ceasefire order and launched attacks on the National Army to the north, southwest, and around Changchun. On the morning of the 14th, they destroyed the Sun Bridge on the China Chang Railway. This news has led to widespread belief that the Communist army in the Northeast is planning a large-scale operation to attack the National Army in all directions. In summary, Misha Zi north of Changchun and Shijia Bu south of Changchun on the China Chang Railway have both been attacked. There are even rumors that they intend to destroy the Dong Liao River Railway Bridge, a challenging engineering project on the China Chang Railway.

<h3 id="e15">Test Run on the Pingzhang Railway; It is Reported That Fu Zuoyi Invited a Group of Reporters from Tianjin and Beijing to Zhangjiakou; It is Said That the Mongolian Banner Problem is Not Complicated <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>[Our Beijing Dispatch, 16th] The Tianjin Beijing Railway Bureau held a test run on the Pingzhang section of the Pingsui Line on the 14th, and specially invited reporters stationed in various places in Tianjin and Beijing to Zhangjiakou. The group returned on the evening of the 16th. Fu Zuoyi, commander of the Twelfth War Zone, hosted the reporter group on the evening of the 15th. He made the following answers to various questions: (1) Fu said: He is still in the process of understanding various issues in the Chahar Province. This stage of understanding can be concluded recently. In the short term, he may go to the capital to attend the National Congress. The reorganization of the Chahar Provincial Government may be concrete before he leaves. (2) Fu believes that the so-called Mongolian Banner issue is not as complicated as the outside world says. If it were as some people say, then he might not be able to enter Zhangjiakou. He believes that everything needs to be treated with sincerity and fairness. Then there will be no problem. (3) Regarding the issue of whether Chahar Province's grain and fur will be subject to unified control in the future, Fu said that he is organizing an economic research committee to invite scholars to participate, consult and decide, and plan how to support and protect local commerce and industry in Chahar Province. There is currently no unified control. Scattered merchants have already been active in Tianjin and Beijing. He hopes that the central government will allocate more funds. The current amount received is still 200 million to promote reconstruction. Fu feels that his subordinates lack talent and is unwilling to bring in personal favors when employing people to avoid unnecessary concerns. The attitude of everyone should be consistent, so it is necessary to train them all. (4) Regarding the attitude towards building Chahar Province, Fu said that he must strictly follow the Three Principles of the People, especially focusing on the Principle of People's Livelihood and the method of equalizing land rights. This is not to cut the high, but to hope to suppress the low. The land rent should be as low as possible. The people said that in Shaanxi, the lowest ratio has reached nine-to-one, which is even lower than the 25% rent reduction. Specific methods will be drafted for reference. Relieving workers is also an important task. (5) Regarding the situation with Outer Mongolia, Fu said that he had posted a notice on the Sui Meng border in the thirty-third year, strongly advocating friendly relations between China and the Soviet Union. He did not allow our personnel to approach with weapons and sent back those who entered from Outer Mongolia, so nothing happened. In the future, Chahar Province will be the same. As for the division of the border, the "Naobao" will be used as a marker. (6) Fu opposes the Communist Party's policy of killing people, saying that this policy will never succeed. Finally, he said that Chahar Province had a bumper harvest this year and there was no problem with military food. Fu repeatedly mentioned his experiences in Xiaba over the years and was particularly interested and pleased with the method of producing the lacking materials.</p>

<h3 id="e26">"Bitter Tea Studio" Traitor Zhou Zuoren Sentenced to Fourteen Years in Prison <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>Betraying and Siding with the Enemy Should Bear Criminal Responsibility</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 16th] The case of the traitor Zhou Zuoren of "Bitter Tea Studio" was sentenced in the Capital High Court on the morning of the 16th. At 10:30 AM, Zhou was escorted from the Laohuqiao Detention Center to the High Court waiting room. At 10:50 AM, Court President Ge Zhiqin, along with judges Ge Zhaotang, Shentu Chen, and prosecutor Wang Wenzun, opened a joint panel in the Dacheng Hall and brought Zhou to court. After briefly inquiring about his name, age, birthplace, and address, the main text of the verdict was read out: "Zhou Zuoren, jointly colluding with enemy countries, plotting to resist this country, sentenced to fourteen years of imprisonment, deprived of public rights for ten years, and property confiscated except for a reasonable amount of necessary living expenses for family members."</p>
<p>Zhou was wearing a long blue indigo cloth shirt, light yellow socks, and black and yellow woolen shoes. His beard and hair were gray and white, and he wore gold-rimmed glasses. He looked calm after hearing the verdict. The court instructed: If you do not agree, you can apply for review. Then he was escorted back to prison.</p>
<p>The verdict of Zhou's case, the first half narrates the facts of his crime, and the second half is the reason for the verdict. The main points are as follows: The defendant Zhou admitted to holding various false positions, and his argument that he maintained education and resisted enslavement was not enough to cover up his collusion with the main traitors in North China, colluding with each other, and carrying out false orders under the will of the Japanese. The evidence of his behavior in favor of resisting Japan is still accurate, and although the sentence should be reduced according to law, the behavior of betrayal is unforgivable. "According to the fact that the defendant has been teaching in various universities for many years, and countless people in my country have been influenced by him, and he has considerable knowledge, and many people in my country admire him, he occupies a leading position among the masses, and bears the heavy responsibility of education in the highest institutions. He should have the spirit of fearlessness and persevere to the end to support the righteousness of the nation. However, his will was weak, and once he was assassinated, he betrayed midway, surrendered to the false regime and sided with the enemy, facing the enemy with a flattering face, only seeking personal survival and security, regardless of the interests of the country and the nation, and cannot bear criminal responsibility. Taking into account various circumstances, a reduced term of imprisonment of fourteen years should be imposed, and public rights should be deprived for ten years, in order to maintain the law and show fairness."</p>

<h3 id="e34">Editorial: The Youth Party Participates in the National Assembly <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>As the National Assembly convenes, many social notables have reported their attendance. Furthermore, the Youth Party has submitted its list of participants in the National Assembly. Its Minister of Propaganda, Mr. Zuo Shunsheng, has even issued a written statement on this matter, elaborating on the party's process and reasons for participating in the National Assembly, and concluding that "merit and demerit, right and wrong, vary from person to person; everything can only be judged impartially by contemporary worthies and future historians." This candid demeanor of a politician is truly worthy of praise from the people of the country. The convening of the National Assembly was originally intended to establish a foundation for the peace and unity of China, as well as for democratic construction, and to formulate a fundamental law for the nation. The success of this historically significant meeting depends entirely on whether the various parties and non-affiliated individuals in the country demonstrate sincere cooperation towards it. The government, in convening the National Assembly, has spared no effort to be extremely tolerant and accommodating, originally hoping that all parties, factions, and non-affiliated individuals could participate together, discuss national affairs, and formulate a perfect constitution for the long-term peace and stability of the country. Therefore, it has tried its best to accommodate all opinions, not hesitating to postpone it repeatedly. The National Assembly, originally scheduled to convene on the birthday of the Founding Father, was ultimately extended by three days due to the efforts of mediators. This shows that the government's tolerance for the country has reached its peak. Three days later, on the day of the National Assembly's opening, we saw the attendance of social notables and the submission of the Youth Party's list, which immediately gave us a sense of infinite brightness for the future of the overall situation.</p>
<p>Why do we say this? The current government, with the Kuomintang in power, adheres to the Three Principles of the People of the revolution and originally hoped to implement constitutional government and return power to the people as soon as possible. The convening of the National Assembly is the initial stage of implementing constitutional government, hoping to promulgate it throughout the country after the constitution is formulated, thereby leading the country into the regular track of constitutional government. For the sake of peaceful unification and democratic construction, the government has repeatedly respected the opinions of all forces and shown extreme tolerance. All these facts are known to the people of the country. If all parties and factions have the sincerity of peaceful unification and democratic construction, they should unanimously participate in the National Assembly and jointly plan national affairs. As the spokesperson of the Youth Party said: "We believe that since the ceasefire has been implemented, only unanimous participation in the National Assembly can maintain the hope of continued peace; only unanimous participation in the National Assembly can promote national unity... Only by passing the draft constitution revised by the Political Consultative Conference in this National Assembly and obtaining unanimous support from the entire country can democracy be effectively guaranteed." All these words are enough to represent the general will of the people of the country. Since the National Assembly has been repeatedly postponed at the request of all parties, the National Assembly, which has been postponed, should naturally be attended by all parties. The people of the whole country have high hopes for the National Assembly, so refusing to participate in the National Assembly is tantamount to isolating oneself from the people of the country; future historians will surely have a fair argument. Therefore, due to the postponed convening of the National Assembly, whether or not all parties participate can show whether all parties have the sincerity for peaceful unification and democratic construction, and whether they put the interests of the people first; thus, the political situation, which has been confusing for a year, has turned towards a bright trend.</p>
<p>Therefore, we feel regret when we read the statement of the Chinese Communist Party in the newspaper. The convening of the National Assembly was originally intended to melt all parties and factions into one furnace; to achieve this goal, all parties and factions must put the interests of the people first, abandon prejudices, and participate together. This is why the government has repeatedly tolerated, and this is why the National Assembly has been repeatedly postponed. Now that the National Assembly has opened, all parties and factions should unite to participate and jointly plan national affairs. If the National Assembly has a "split" phenomenon, then those who create this situation are the CCP and other people who refuse to participate, which is not only a destructive act against the National Assembly, but also a malicious act that destroys the interests of the entire nation. The people need stability, and the country needs construction, so they have high expectations for the National Assembly. Refusing to participate in the National Assembly is tantamount to isolating oneself from the people of the country; future history will surely have a fair judgment.</p>
<p>Therefore, for those people who have not yet attended the National Assembly and those parties that have not yet submitted their lists, we hope that they can participate as soon as possible. This is because all parties have repeatedly expressed their opinions on the convening of the National Assembly, and to respect these opinions, the National Assembly has been postponed repeatedly. Now that the National Assembly has opened, there should be no reason not to participate. Since the Youth Party has submitted its list, then the Democratic Socialist Party and other people who belong to the so-called "third party" have worked hard for national affairs, and at this moment they should confirm the trend of history, submit their lists, and participate in the National Assembly together. We sincerely hope that the convening of this National Assembly can lay the foundation for the long-term peace and stability of the country and enter the regular track of constitutional government; then a new China of the Three Principles of the People, which is of the people, by the people, and for the people, and is prosperous and happy, can be established soon!</p>

<h3 id="e35">Emphasis on Rectifying the Source; Second Phase of Suppression in Yangcheng District; Bandit Leader Liu Gengui Killed on the Changtai Border <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>[Report from Suzhou, This Newspaper, 16th] Major General Ma Shigong, Commander of the Parachute Corps stationed in Suzhou, Commander of the Yangcheng District Suppression Command, and Commander of the Suzhou City Defense Command, received reporters from this newspaper on the afternoon of the 16th. In his statement, he briefly stated that in addition to being responsible for the Suzhou city defense and Yangcheng District suppression work, the headquarters is also responsible for consolidating the security of the Jinghu Line and strengthening the external defense of Shanghai. At the beginning of the winter defense and the National Assembly, in order to prevent bandits from disturbing the area, orders have been given to begin the second phase of suppression. The focus is on clarifying local administration, establishing land and water security, improving regional intelligence, and implementing mutual assistance and joint defense systems. It also includes handling the work of recruiting scattered bandits and turning them into new people through enlightenment, in order to rectify the source and achieve lasting peace, and establish a foundation for the long-term peace and stability of Jiangnan. Specifically, it can be divided into four aspects: (1) Regarding the suppression situation, banditry in various counties has been quelled. In October, a total of 558 bandits were captured, 128 surrendered and reformed, 2 light machine guns, 14 rifles, and 12 pistols were seized. The "New Fourth Army" organization was cracked down on, including Jin Baojiu, the head of the Changshu Zhitang Communications Station, and Wu Shouying, the commander of the Luodian pseudo-Jiangnan Self-Defense Army. Other hidden bandits, such as Li Gancai from Kunshan, Tao Yunsheng from Changshu Liancheng, Zhu Kunyou from Meili, and Lu Jiakang from Zhitang, were also arrested by the suppression forces. Therefore, the bandit forces have been weakened and are approaching their end. The period of clearing is not far away. (2) Maintaining public security: In addition to all routine measures, the counties under its jurisdiction are ordered to strengthen winter defense and implement amnesty to achieve the primary goal of current public security. (3) Rectifying discipline: Since the beginning of the suppression, attention has been paid to the conduct and integrity of personnel, and no harm to the local area, collusion with the people, or extortion is allowed. Emphasis is also placed on the integration of the party, government, and military, with mutual supervision. (4) Training the Self-Defense Force: Cadres are assigned to the counties under the jurisdiction to train the Self-Defense Force to strengthen self-defense capabilities. Currently, 385 people in Suzhou have started training, and the first phase in Changshu has completed 180 people, with the second phase currently in training. Other counties, such as Kunshan, Taicang, Jiading, and Baoshan, have also organized and trained them one after another and will soon complete a strong local armed force.</p>
<p>[Report from Suzhou, This Newspaper, 16th] Liu Genbao and Liu Gengui, two bandits from the "New Fourth Army" who disrupted the towns of Zhitang, Shaxi, and Laozha on the border of Changshu and Taicang, the pseudo-Taicang County Chief, the Security Brigade Commander, and the Director of the Autonomous Committee, were constantly besieged by the suppression forces of Changtai County. Most of the main forces dispersed. Liu Genbao sneaked into northern Jiangsu, while Liu Gengui led the remnants to wander around. On the 12th, he encountered a parachuting sweep force in Zhizhuang. A fierce battle broke out. Liu Gengui was injured and threw himself into the river and died. The remaining party fled in all directions. A bandit Wang Chuanlin was captured alive and a short gun, many hand grenades, maps, documents, and other items were seized. All the personal witnesses were escorted to the Yangcheng Command in Suzhou on the 16th for interrogation.</p>

<p>[Report from Haining, This Newspaper] The "Jue" numbered seawall outside the South Gate of this county has developed cracks due to years of disrepair. On the evening of the 12th, it suddenly collapsed by as much as seven meters. The reporter visited the relevant authorities to inquire about the rescue situation. It was reported that the Seawall Engineering Bureau has transported more than 1,500 bundles of strip wood and two sets of pile frames from Babao, but the seawall workers have not been fully recruited and are still rushing to prepare. The rescue work has not yet begun. It is also reported that all the machinery and materials of the Seawall Engineering Bureau are difficult to transport, and it does not want to transport them to Ning for rescue, causing extreme panic among the people of Ningcheng. The night tides have been particularly high in recent days, and the breach is flooded with seawater, with loud rumbling noises constantly heard. On the evening of the 14th, the "Jue" numbered seawall was washed away another two meters at both ends. Now, the dangerous and cracked sections of the seawall from Dou Pantou have reached a length of 150 meters. If the rescue project is delayed further, once the entire seawall collapses, Ningcheng will be completely turned into a swamp. The county government and the county council have re-telegraphed the provincial authorities, urging them to rescue quickly to save the dangerous situation.</p>
<p>[Report from Hangzhou, This Newspaper, 16th] The "Jue" numbered seawall in Zhejiang Province has recently collapsed again. Today, a reporter from this newspaper visited the person in charge of the Seawall Engineering Bureau and was told that the body of the "Jue" numbered seawall had collapsed, but the seawall base still exists. Currently, work is underway to excavate the seawall foot and build a new concrete seawall, measuring 100 city feet in length. The earth embankment at Chen Tanggang and other collapsed parts will also be started. The revetment project in Hangzhou will be completed soon, and the seawall project in Xiaoshan and other places on the south bank is also in progress.</p>
<p>[Report from Hangzhou, This Newspaper, 16th] Chairman Shen of Zhejiang Province inspected the seawalls in Sibao and other places in Hangzhou on the 16th and instructed the revetment project.</p>

<p>[Report from Rugao, This Newspaper] In the Subei Pacification District, the government has repeatedly issued instructions on "three points of military affairs, seven points of politics." The local garrison authorities and county government agencies have carefully followed them. In order to expand political propaganda, a propaganda team has been jointly organized to expand propaganda during the celebration of the Premier's birthday and the National Congress. In addition, students from the detention training center will go deep into the countryside to conduct door-to-door propaganda, hoping to achieve practical results. In addition, Wang, the division commander of the 49th Division of the garrison, issued a bulletin strictly prohibiting scattered soldiers, intelligence personnel, and guerrillas from taking the opportunity to disturb the people, and hoped that the people would report them. At the same time, political education for the army was stepped up to ensure that the military and the people were united as one.</p>
<h3 id="e39">Two Bandits Captured in Lumu; Committed Crimes in Shanghai <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>[Report from Suzhou, This Newspaper] Bandits Feng Laowu, Wang Genrong, etc., successively robbed the homes of Cao Wantong and Cao Yazi, as well as the General Administration Hall of Suizhou Qimenwai Huajinggang, etc., in Suzhou, Lumu, and Nan Shen this spring. They also colluded with others in Shanghai between June and July this year to rob a brothel on Simalu, a cloth store on Laborbert Road, and a hardware store on Caojiabo Wu Yi Chang, and the Hongkou Fish Market, etc., committing numerous crimes. Under the strict dominance of the Shanghai Municipal Police Department, four accomplices, Chen Jiaxi, Liu Zhaochen, Liu Yudong, and Yu, were detained, and Feng was wanted with a golden warrant. As a result, the two bandits Feng and Wang could not survive in Shanghai, and they escaped from the net a month ago and came to Suzhou, hiding in Lutang Township, Lumu District. They actively colluded with gangsters in the city, trying to stir up trouble in Suzhou again. Fortunately, someone secretly reported to the Lumu Self-Defense Team stationed there. The team sent personnel to meet with the local security chiefs, pretending to be checking household registrations, and caught the two bandits Feng and Wang by surprise. According to their confessions, they had already colluded with two accomplices in the city, Liu Jinshan and Shen Shaoqing, who were hiding at No. 14 Guanku Lane and No. 89 Gushi Lane respectively, waiting for an opportunity to stir up trouble. Personnel were dispatched to escort the two bandits to the city, where they cooperated with the First Police Station in charge to detain the two bandits Liu and Shen one after another, and directly escort them to the Suzhou City Defense Command for strict punishment according to law.</p>

<p>[Report from Suzhou, This Newspaper] The Dongting Dongshan liner "Traveler" left Shan at 7:30 am on the 14th, carrying more than 100 passengers to Suzhou. When it sailed to Bainongkou near Ducun, five or six bandit ships suddenly appeared, with light and heavy machine guns mounted on the bows. They approached the ship in a four-sided encirclement. About thirty or forty bandits, all armed with long and short guns, boarded the ship in a swarm and monitored the actions of the drivers, crew, and passengers, forcing them to sail towards South Taihu Lake. When it sailed to the center of South Taihu Lake, about three miles away from Ducun, they ordered it to stop and arbitrarily looted. The overcoats and better clothes of the male and female passengers on the ship were stripped off, and no one on the ship was spared. After more than an hour, the bandits divided the loot into their small boats and roared away. The Suzhou Police Department is now sending officers to investigate and arrest them.</p>
<h3 id="e43">Canal Shipping; Direct to Huaiyin; Security Consolidated, Restoration Recently <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>[Report from Zhenjiang, This Newspaper] Since the national army recovered Huaiyin, the Zhenjiang Office of the Yangtze River Navigation Administration Bureau has been urging the resumption of navigation on the Zhenqing Line. The Zhonghua Lv Yun Society dispatched a ship for a trial voyage on October 23. However, due to the fact that the security situation in Huangpu and between the eight lines above Baoying has not been consolidated, and navigation is quite threatened, the shipping line was temporarily shortened to Baoying starting on October 31. Now that the number of national troops stationed along the canal has increased and the security situation has improved, the Navigation Administration Bureau has again ordered the shipping bureaus to resume navigation. It is reported that four ships, Huafu, Ronghua, Maoli, and Run Dong, dispatched by the Zhonghua Lv Yun Society, and four ships, Xiangshan, Feilv, and Shengli Feichou, dispatched by the Datong Tongyun Company and the Zhenjiang Branch of the state-owned China Merchants Bureau, resumed navigation on October 13 and towed relief supplies from the Su Ning Branch to Qing for relief. The passenger fare is 56 yuan per person per kilometer, from Zhenjiang to Huaiyin is 10,700 yuan, from Zhenjiang to Huaian is 9,900 yuan, from Zhenjiang to Baoying is 7,800 yuan, from Zhenjiang to Gaoyou is 6,300 yuan, and the freight per ton is five and a half times the passenger fare.

Considering this year's bumper harvest of rice grains, it was decided that each mu would actually receive two dan of brown rice, with half for the landlord and half for the tenant. The landlord should get one dan, and the 25% rent reduction should be implemented, and 7.5 sheng should be collected. Later, at the request of the representative of the County Party Department, considering that the cost of farmers is high and their lives are difficult, it was requested to reduce the rent again. Finally, it was decided that each mu would be charged with 7 dou of brown rice or 6 dou and 3 sheng of white rice, with 160 city catties as the standard. One dou should be added to the actual rent, and 3 dou of brown rice should be added to the board rent per dan, starting from today. The first two limits are 20 days each, 3 dou should be added beyond the first limit, and 2 dou should be added beyond the second limit.</p>

<h3 id="e45">A Unique Occupation; Yang Jiliang Specializes in Accusing Traitors; Investigation Reveals All False Accusations; Has Been Detained <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>[Report from Wuxi, This Newspaper] Before the Anti-Japanese War in Xiyi, there was a group of idlers who secretly used the organizations of "Old Eight Party" and "New Eight Party" to specialize in reporting cases of people violating laws and police regulations. Beforehand, they would contact the parties involved and extort huge sums of money. If they did not get what they wanted, they would come out and report, causing a storm in the city and making everyone grit their teeth. Later, it was detected by the officialdom and severely arrested, and this trend disappeared. During the occupation, a small number of party members of the New and Old Eight Parties changed careers or died. After the victory, the affairs of eliminating traitors arose one after another. At first, it was chaotic, so that people from all walks of life were in danger. After the cases of traitors were clearly ordered to be handled by the judiciary, the society began to be quiet. Recently, the Jiangsu Higher Court has repeatedly received reports from Yang Jiliang, also known as Yang Zongying and Yang Jianying, who resides at No. 9 Tianji Bang in Wuxi City, accusing a large number of traitors. For example, Zhang Zhitong was accused of being the pseudo-President of the Legislative Yuan, Xu Juncai was accused of being the pseudo-Director of the Education Department, and Zhang Sheng was accused of being a pseudo-female detective. After receiving the report, the Higher Court ordered the Xiyi Court to secretly detain them. After receiving the order, Chief Ma of this county conducted a strict investigation. As a result, it was found that Zhang Zhitong and Xu Juncai were both rice merchants, and Ms. Zhang Sheng is currently a senator of the Provisional Council and returned from the rear. Chief Ma arrested Yang Jiliang for interrogation. The suspect firmly denied using the names Yang Zongying and Yang Jianying and ordered him to be detained for verification. Before Yang Jiliang was detained, the bailiff of the court delivered the summons of Yang Zongying. Because Yang Jiliang refused to accept it, he posted the summons on his gate, a total of seven or eight times, which set a record for this county. It is said that Yang Jiliang was originally a businessman. Because his speculation failed, he had a fantasy and specialized in reporting traitors, defrauding property, and making a living. This kind of occupation is also unique.</p>

<p>[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch] A type of wild boar, of varying sizes, has recently been discovered in the mountains of Xilin Township, Shangdang District, in this county. A local hunter captured one, which had a small head and a pointed snout, with bright eyes and two very sharp lower teeth protruding from its mouth by about an inch. Its body was covered in black hair interspersed with stiff bristles like a hedgehog, ranging in length from five inches to a foot. They resemble hairpins used by women. When attacked, they rush around with great force, their bristles standing on end, making a rattling sound. According to those in the know, this is a "rattle pig."</p>
<h3 id="e49">Flying Thief Li San Interrogated: Court Hearing Held Twice in One Day <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>[Our Jinan Dispatch] The flying thief Li Shengwu, (aka Swallow Li San), whose exploits shocked Jinan, was brought to the local court. In the morning of the 11th a court hearing was held for questioning. Suspects Jia Jinbang, Hao Bohong, Han Xiuqing, Yang Yide, etc., were also questioned. According to Li, the Xue Liwen case in Dongxiaowangfu, and the robbery cases in the silver shops, etc., in this city, were all his work. The prosecutor Wu Tingxian, who is handling the case, argued that, apart from the Xue Liwen murder case in Jinan, there were no other cases of injury. When he questioned the other suspects, they all defended themselves, claiming to have only a superficial relationship with Li and were ignorant of the details. Due to time constraints, the interrogation was temporarily adjourned. Prosecutor Wu considered that Li's case had spread throughout Jinan, known to all, young and old, and the news spread was not without inaccuracies. Although Li had already confessed, there were still some ambiguities. For the sake of prudence, he held another court hearing at 2:00 PM, summoning Zhang Chunting, who arrested Li, and Xue Liwen, the victim's family, for questioning. Xue did not appear due to other business. After the court session, Li Xinlu, another suspect, was found to be suspicious, because he often went to Li's house to smoke opium and stay overnight. The prosecutor believes that Li Xinlu's relationship with Li was intimate, and that Li Xinlu was unlikely to be indifferent to Li's whereabouts. However, Li Xinlu firmly denied the accusations, so he was temporarily detained. Two court hearings were held in one day, with very good results. According to Prosecutor Wu, the case is being actively investigated. Because the general public attaches great importance to it, he decided to file a lawsuit in the short term. It is said that another court hearing will be held in the next few days for further investigation.</p>

<p>Recently, in bustling areas on the western side of Shanghai, there are often groups of rogue youths, three or five in number, randomly throwing firecrackers, sounding like gunshots, one after another. Upon hearing them, pedestrians are startled and fearful, even suspecting burglar alarms. Especially the elderly, weak, women, and children are frightened and lose their composure. These youths then clap and laugh! They are even more prone to harassing young women! Currently, winter defense is urgent, and safety is paramount. These explosive sounds are most likely to cause misunderstandings. It is hoped that those maintaining local security will take action to stop them, preventing problems before they occur. The citizens will be very grateful! (Zhu Xianlin, Park Police) (Editor's note: Mr. Jin Lianzhi, a reader of our newspaper, has also made the same statement, so it will not be published again.)</p>

<p>Near the intersection of Bintang Road and Jiaozhou Road, there is a stinky ditch. Two weeks ago, the Public Works Bureau sent workers to dredge it, and the mud from the river was placed on the side of the road. At that time, the street was filled with a foul odor and slippery mud, making it difficult to walk. We all thought that once it dried, it would be carted away. But to this day, the mud is still halfway across the road, and in addition, the neighbors have dumped garbage on it, making it smell even worse than before. It is hoped that the authorities in charge, for the sake of the health of the residents in the western part of Shanghai, will send someone to clean it up quickly so that traffic and hygiene are not hindered.

<p>I am a low-level businessman. For economic reasons and to prevent my daughter from dropping out of school, I had her take the entrance exam for the municipal kindergarten teacher training school, and she was fortunate enough to be admitted. The Municipal Bureau of Education, in order to reduce the burden on parents, issues students with a monthly food subsidy based on the cost of living index, which makes poor parents extremely grateful. However, it is now mid-November, and the subsidies for September and October have not yet been received. I don't know if the Bureau of Education has not issued them, or if the school has received them but not distributed them. Therefore, I have to ask the education community to show sympathy and live up to the original intention. (Wang Zhengming)</p>

<p>There are dozens of women and children resembling refugees gathered in the open space at the Sichuan Road Bridge in this city, and this has been the case for over a month. No one has asked about them, and no one has provided relief. As the severe winter is approaching, they are curled up there, exposed to the wind and dew, which is truly unbearable. The appearance of the city aside, even human feelings and morality are not aligned. It is proposed to use your newspaper to raise awareness and call for the attention of relevant authorities or charitable organizations to provide relief so that these helpless women and children can avoid freezing to death.

<p>Regarding the letter from Mr. Chen Lianhu and others stating that the Caohejing bus line has been suspended, we have received a letter from the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities stating: "The Xiang Sheng Transportation Company applied to this Bureau in March of last year to operate Longhua tourist buses and special buses to benefit tourists during the Longhua Xiangxun festival. In April of this year, the Bureau ordered the company to come to the Bureau to sign a contract to comply with the rules. However, the company has not complied, so it has been suspended. Now, in order to temporarily maintain Shanghai-Caohejing line, the Bureau decided that beginning on the 18th of this month, the Preparatory Committee of the Public Transportation Company will dispatch four buses from Laoximen, via Fuxing Road, Baoqing Road, Hengshan Road, Wanping Road, and Jinyi Road, to Longhua. The buses will then return via Shiji Road and Xietu Road to Caohejing Town. The Bureau has publicly solicited bids for this route, and several transportation companies have applied. In the future, when the municipal government makes a decision and hands over the route to a business for operation, the Bureau's temporary buses will be discontinued. As for the news that the Bureau forced the company to stop operating because it could not collect road maintenance fees and other fees, it is a misunderstanding. These fees are the company's obligation to the municipal government. Any transportation company operating a business passenger car on a designated route in the city must pay them, not only Xiang Sheng Transportation Company. 'Hereby conveyed.'"</p>

<h3 id="e57">Limiting the Use of the Veto: Decision to be Discussed by the Five Powers; Both the US and the Soviet Union Oppose Amending the UN Charter <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 16th] British Foreign Secretary Bevin invited the delegations of the five major powers of the UN General Assembly last night to directly discuss the veto issue. China, the US, and France immediately accepted, and the Soviet Union also expressed agreement. The discussion will likely take place next Monday. Well-informed sources said that France will propose to the Political and Security Committee of the UN General Assembly today to suspend the debate on the veto issue and allow the five powers to discuss whether to limit the use of the veto.</p>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 15th] British Foreign Secretary Bevin has sent letters to the chief representatives of China, the US, and the Soviet Union at the UN General Assembly, suggesting that a meeting of the five major powers be convened to discuss the veto issue. The purpose of the five-power consultation is to draft a "code of conduct" stipulating the circumstances under which the five powers may or may not exercise the veto. Previously, British and American representatives suggested that the five powers hold informal talks to discuss various issues of the United Nations, but this was not approved by the Soviet representative. However, Soviet representative Gromyko today told some representatives that he was willing to support holding five-power talks to discuss the veto issue. The various suggestions put forward by the five powers for discussion include: (1) The United Kingdom's request to clearly define the definitions of "situation" and "dispute" that threaten peace. If it is a dispute, then one of the five powers, if it is a party to the dispute, must not have the right to vote. (2) The United States suggests that the five powers draft a list of cases in which the veto can be used. (3) The French proposal would allow a power unwilling to obstruct the actions of the Security Council to abstain from voting, thus automatically preventing it from exercising the veto.</p>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 15th] According to the British delegation, the veto provision in the UN Charter was originally the idea of ​​US President Franklin D. Roosevelt. However, we have repeatedly defended the principle of unanimity among the five major powers, being more courageous than successful, and we cannot help but feel guilty. We acknowledge this. Small countries such as Australia, Cuba, and the Netherlands are using this as an excuse to try to amend the Charter, which is also not what we want. If this matter evolves into a struggle between small countries and big countries, we would rather the UN General Assembly close as soon as possible. The US position has been explained by Senator Connally in the Political and Security Committee with nine opinions. Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky also said that the Soviet Union has always opposed amending the Charter and undermining the UN mechanism. The US representative agreed, saying that amending the UN Charter could lead to the collapse of the UN mechanism. Vyshinsky also said that those who attempt to amend the Charter are actually adopting a strategy of alienating the enemy and defeating them one by one. However, this strategy of alienating the great powers will not succeed. The Soviet Union is committed to building peace through cooperation based on the solidarity of the great powers. Therefore, it believes that the proposals of small countries such as Cuba, Australia, and the Philippines are a big mistake.</p>

<p>[Reuters, New York, 16th] The Foreign Ministers' Meeting is scheduled to continue debating the Trieste issue at 9:00 PM today (5:00 AM on the 17th Shanghai time). The discussion will be based on the new plan drafted by French representative Mauviel. Most of the agreements that have been reached yesterday have been included in this new plan. However, the following two principles remain unresolved: (1) Should the final power belong to the governor of the free zone or to the government? (2) Should the governor's authority over the police continue to exist after the governor is appointed until the government establishes representative institutions? Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov's recognition that the governor should have the right to decide what constitutes a state of emergency is a major concession. Molotov said yesterday that this concession by the Soviet Union could break the deadlock.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Lake Success, 15th] The representatives of Czechoslovakia and Poland announced today that they have asked the Foreign Ministers' Meeting to allow them to participate in discussions on the German issue and any matters related to their interests.</p>

<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 15th] The representatives of the Security Council have different opinions on how many times the veto has been used, but they unanimously believe that the Soviet Union has used it the most. Its record is as follows:</p>
<p>"Soviet Union" - once in the Lebanon and Syria case, four times in the Spanish case (the Soviet Union said that these four times should be counted as one); once against the investigation of the Greek border conflict, three times against the applications of Ireland, Portugal, and Transjordan to join the UN. "France" - once in the Spanish case. "Britain and the United States" - It is debatable whether Britain and the United States' opposition to the applications of Albania and Mongolia to join the UN counts as a veto. The British and Americans claim that the case was not supported by a majority, so the opposition of Britain and the United States is not a veto.</p>

<h3 id="e69">British House of Commons to Discuss Foreign Policy Tomorrow; Prime Minister Will Attend and Defend; American Newspapers Observe That Bevin May Change His Style <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 16th] Since the Speaker of the House of Commons announced that the amendment proposed by the Labor Party "rebel" members to the King's speech at the opening of Parliament could be submitted for discussion, more than 50 "rebel" members have drafted a plan to publicly debate "Bevinism" on Monday. The "rebel" members are now demanding that Britain adopt a "socialist" foreign policy to avoid the conflict between the Soviet Union and the United States that will "inevitably" arise under the current British foreign policy. Most parliamentary observers believe that the way in which members oppose Bevin's policies will be limited to debate. If it is put to a vote, it will be defeated by conservatives and "loyal" supporters of the government.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 15th] British Prime Minister Attlee spoke by long distance telephone today with Foreign Secretary Bevin in New York to discuss the "rebellion" of 73 Labor Party members. When the House of Commons held a meeting this morning, some Labor Party members who disagreed with the government decided to request a discussion on foreign policy on the 18th of this month. Although they claimed that this move did not involve a vote of confidence, reliable sources said that Prime Minister Attlee gave the Foreign Secretary every convenience in his telephone conversation with Bevin today so that he could come to London and personally defend the foreign policy adopted by Britain. It is said that Foreign Secretary Bevin only replied that it was indispensable for him to stay in New York and could only ask the Prime Minister to defend him on his behalf.</p>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 15th] Famous current affairs analyst Hirsch broadcast a commentary on the British Labor Party members opposing Bevin's foreign policy, saying that the young "rebel" members wanted to oust Bevin and replace him with Dalton, believing that Dalton could detach Britain's economy from the United States and then seek a compromise with the Soviet Union. Bevin's ouster is unlikely to become a reality, but it is likely that Bevin will change his style to cater to their wishes. The New York Times commented that this "rebellion" took place at a time when the British and American governments were in delicate negotiations with the Soviet Union, which was unfavorable to Bevin and Byrnes, because the success of the negotiations with the Soviet Union depended on the consistency of British and American policies.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Jerusalem, 15th] Jewish terrorists continued their nerve warfare, calling a newspaper here today to inform them that government offices, the Palestine Broadcasting Station, and the local magistrate's office had been planted with bombs, and told them to pay special attention to things that seemed harmless. After a search, a small package was found in the local magistrate's office. The police dared not act rashly and asked the engineers to inspect it.

<p>[This newspaper's special correspondent in London, 16th] The London Foreign Office is paying close attention to the border conflict between Greece and Yugoslavia. The US has also expressed concern. Reliable sources said that today, unidentified "bandits" attacked the Greek border again and were repelled.</p>
<p>[United Press, Athens, 15th] It was officially announced that the Greek government forces recaptured the border village of Skra today. At the same time, fierce fighting has continued for four days between the village and Anchangelos (six miles south of the Yugoslav border). The Third Army Headquarters said that two brigades of troops equipped with tanks had entered the area. The Athens General Headquarters received a report from Pantelis, commander of the Third Army, that more than 1,000 people had gathered on the Bulgarian side of the Greek border, at the point where the two countries border Yugoslavia. More than 800 rioters attacked Skra village yesterday and were repelled, with four soldiers and 22 rioters killed. 250 rioters were cut off, trying to join the main force and escape into Yugoslavia.</p>
<p>The Greek Prime Minister Declared</p>
<p>Skra village was attacked by rioters with heavy machine guns and mortars three days ago, and the rioters fled into Yugoslavia. It is rumored that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is considering filing a complaint with the UN Security Council. Unofficially, it is believed that the border conflict has the nature of "launching an undeclared war against Greece." Lukatsis Voudoubis said: "In this war, the government must take urgent measures to stop the endless incidents. The attack was limited to Greek territory, but 200 rioters from the vanguard were joined by 800 uniformed troops from the north of the Yugoslav border." Voudoubis refused to specify the nationality of the troops, but a spokesman for the General Headquarters believed that the attacking troops came from training camps in Yugoslavia. All official reports acknowledge that a large number of rioters and troops clashed and then fled into Yugoslavia. According to news from Skra village, there were a total of 55 deaths, and most of the bodies were mutilated. The village has a population of only 646, but it is famous in history. During World War I, the Greek army drove out the Bulgarian army and took the lead in breaking through the Balkan defense line, which was at this location.</p>

<p>[Reuters Hong Kong 16th Dispatch] Reliable sources report: 50,000 to 60,000 ounces of Mexican gold are en route to Macau. This is one of the main reasons for the recent drop in gold prices here. The price once fell to as low as $279 per tael this morning, but later recovered slightly to $296. It is believed here that the final destination of this gold is likely to be the mainland and Hong Kong. Since gold imports into Hong Kong require a special permit issued by the Hong Kong government, it is expected that this gold will only be smuggled into China and Hong Kong when the opportunity arises.</p>

<p>[Agence France-Presse London 15th Dispatch] The British House of Commons recently discussed the silk industry, believing that the British silk industry still cannot compete with low-priced Japanese silk dumping. Therefore, they suggested that the government should make strong representations to the American military authorities in Japan. Unless a large amount of raw silk is imported into Britain in the shortest possible time, British silk workers will be unemployed. British people, regardless of whether they are left-wing or right-wing, are concerned about MacArthur's efforts to restore the Japanese textile industry and make Japan a major industrial power in the Far East again.</p>
<h3 id="e80">Japan Under Occupation (Part 1): The Occupation Work is Divided into Three Stages <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>— Original by Relman Morin, New York Times Tokyo Correspondent, Translated by Zhang Deqian</p>
<p>One year ago, on August 30, 1945 (U.S. time), a military transport plane landed at the dusty Atsugi Airfield outside Tokyo. General MacArthur climbed down from the ladder and began the Allied occupation of Japan. He was wearing a spotless open-necked khaki uniform and a cap embroidered with gold thread, just as his subordinates had seen him at more than a dozen beachheads in the Southwest Pacific. Other generals often wore dark green work clothes to avoid attacks by guerrillas, but MacArthur never liked wearing that kind of clothing.</p>
<p>Behind him was a glorious war record of three years of constant victories, advancing by land and sea from the southeastern corner of New Guinea all the way to northern Philippines. However, he casually made a speech to the American and Japanese reporters who came to greet him, saying: "We have come a long and arduous road, but now we seem to have been rewarded."</p>
<p>But the work that MacArthur began that day, his staff still call it "the greatest gamble in military history." Japan had already announced its surrender and sent a committee to Manila for preliminary contacts; however, the surrender document had not yet been signed. MacArthur had only 50,000 troops under his command. And surrounding them were 4 million armed Japanese soldiers. As long as the Japanese army made a move, these few American troops would immediately become prisoners. However, the Japanese army did not make a move. Not only did they not make a move, but they also mobilized a large number of old cars to transport the American troops to Tokyo and Yokohama.</p>
<p>The formal surrender ceremony was held at 8:00 PM (U.S. Eastern War Time) on September 1 on the battleship Missouri in Tokyo Bay. MacArthur won the first hand he played in his biggest gamble. The occupying forces settled in Japan, waiting for the Japanese to contribute to democracy by establishing "a responsible government with a peaceful orientation," according to the terms of the Potsdam Declaration upon which they surrendered.</p>
<p>To assess the gains in this area, the purpose of the occupation should first be divided into three procedures according to their different natures: (1) Disarmament and demobilization of the Japanese army and navy, and reduction of national war potential; (2) Removal of political obstacles to establish politics that conform to the ideals of the Allied countries—including all old and bad laws and systems, such as the "thought police" and the government-sponsored and war-promoting religious system, etc.; (3) Jointly forming a cooperative organization with the Japanese to create a new democracy, which is the most difficult step.</p>
<p>The first stage has now been completed. At the end of the first year after Japan's surrender, 5,852,000 Japanese soldiers had been disarmed. Some of the Japanese navy that survived the American bombing has also been completely eliminated. A huge amount of weapons has been destroyed. In the Tokyo area alone, 300 licenses have been issued to allow aircraft factories and munitions factories to be converted into civilian factories; in addition, there are 80 factories left, prepared for reparations. Even if the occupation work ends next year, the Japanese will not be able to rearm themselves in their lifetime.</p>
<p>The second stage is progressing smoothly, but has not yet reached such a satisfactory level. Deep-rooted old restrictive laws have been abolished, and a new Americanized constitution and auxiliary legal system will eventually be established. The era of dictatorial directives and basic orders forcing the Japanese to reform was declared over at the beginning of this year.</p>
<p>It is not yet entirely certain whether MacArthur will use compulsory orders as a weapon again to make the Japanese thoroughly obey his orders. U.S. Representative Acheson repeatedly reported to the United Nations Control Commission for Japan, believing that "left-wing totalitarianism" is no different from fanatical militarist rule, and that the Allied Supreme Commander should strictly prohibit the Japanese people from taking these two wrong paths. This is sufficient to fully illustrate the policy held by MacArthur's headquarters in this regard.</p>
<p>Summarizing several legal systems abolished last year, we can roughly see how huge changes have taken place in Japan's domestic institutions. The emperor's power has been severely restricted in practice. Once the new constitution is approved (Editor's note: The new Japanese constitution was formally announced on November 3), his legal status will be no different from an idol—although Emperor Hirohito himself is still admired by the majority of the people, because they believe that he ended the war, otherwise the militarists would have continued to fight.</p>
<p>Zaibatsu are large-scale family capital groups. We have formally announced that the zaibatsu are the patrons of the Japanese military institutions. Now they have been frozen and lost their power. Major zaibatsu organizations such as Mitsui, Mitsubishi, Sumitomo, and Yasuda have all decided to dissolve. The 45 major "colonial banks" used by Japan to exploit occupied territories have also been permanently closed. (Editor's note: The Mitsui and other zaibatsu have recently been formally dissolved)</p>

<h3 id="e81">Lending to Traitors Cannot Be Recovered! Executing Agencies Not Responsible for Repaying Debts; Li Ze's Assets to Be Seized Separately <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>According to sources from the Committee for Handling Traitorous Assets yesterday, the committee discussed the following major cases regarding the handling of traitorous assets: (1) Whether the creditor's rights and debts of all properties of traitors should be cleared on their behalf. It was decided to handle the matter in accordance with Judicial Yuan Interpretation No. 3213, which stated: "The executing agency of all properties confiscated in accordance with Article 8 of the Regulations for Punishing Traitors is not responsible for clearing the debts owed by the traitor and the burdens established on the property." (2) A light yellow Studebaker car suspected of being enemy property seized by the Enemy Property Handling Bureau. Zheng Qingsheng and Wang Zongyao previously submitted a request for its return. The request was approved and they were instructed to provide evidence for verification. Now, the investigation team transferred a request from Deng Qingsheng et al. stating that the purchase certificate for the car was lost and could not be submitted. They requested that the Handling Bureau be consulted and approved for its return. It was decided to submit the original request for review. (3) Commissioner Fan Qizhang submitted a request on October 30, stating that he was ordered to supervise the business of the Xinhua Industrial Society and prepare the society's monthly budget of expenses. Decision: 1. Instruct the person in charge of the factory to prepare a plan for resuming work; 2. Pass the budget; 3. List the names of all the traitors at large who are on file, together with the evidence of their crimes, and send them to the High Procuratorate for review. (4) Gan Shuishi applied to redeem the real estate in Ankang Lane, Yifeng Lane, but the request was rejected. (5) There are still many of General Manager Li Ze's traitorous assets in the New New Company that have not been seized. Should personnel be sent to continue handling the matter? It was decided that the company's shares could be seized by notifying them separately, and Shu Yueqiao should be summoned for questioning for reference. At the same time, the Criminal Division of the High Court should be consulted to report the situation of Li's traitorous assets so that they could be seized. (6) Chu Chen Shunzhen, the wife of the traitor Chu Minyi, applied for the unsealing and return of property that did not belong to Chu Minyi in order to maintain her livelihood. It was decided to transfer the matter to the Jiangsu Committee for Handling Traitorous Assets for review and reporting. (7) It is proposed to publicly lease the Baofeng Silk Factory, which was received and seized in the Wang Yongkang traitorous asset case, and give the lessee a preferential right of purchase. It was decided to lease it first, and when handling it, the estimated value would be allowed to be purchased by the lessee with priority. (8) Chen Kunyuan, a suspected traitor, has been acquitted and released by the Military Law Department of the Chairman's Peiping Headquarters. Please return the sealed property of Chen Kunyuan. It was decided to consult the original judgment in full before reviewing it again. (9) The China Chemical Factory reported that the situation of the 20,000 shares of registered shares and the reasons why they could not be recovered are known. Please waive the recovery. It was decided that the shares should still be recovered. (10) Jin Wenhua, the father of the traitor Jin Taonan, applied to sell the seized property in order to maintain his livelihood. It was decided to discuss it after Jin's traitorous sentence is determined.</p>

<p>Mrs. Cripps said in her speech: "I am very pleased to have this opportunity to tell you about the work of the British Aid to China Fund. I would also like to thank the Chinese government for giving us the opportunity to increase our unlimited knowledge and discuss various issues. The organization of the British Aid to China Fund includes people from all walks of life in Britain. They have different political and religious beliefs, but they are all working together for the purpose of aiding China, forming a cooperative group and generating great power. This trip to China is only temporary, so I cannot easily express my personal opinions, but I firmly believe that you hope that I can briefly describe my impressions of China. We have been greatly welcomed everywhere in China. This kind of grand welcome is beyond my description. I also hope that the aid to China work can be further expanded and promoted. This visit to China is not only to learn and visit from the Chinese people, but also to continue our aid to China work under the friendship between China and the United Kingdom. There are currently many service organizations developing in the United Kingdom, and I hope to exchange opinions with each other. We are very moved by the people who have been persecuted by the Japanese and the people who are struggling to survive in suffering. We have also visited various different regions and completed visits to North China, South China, East China, and West China, and have gone to Hong Kong, Chongqing, Chengdu, Liuzhou, Yan'an and other places to visit various public institutions. Although the people of Shenyang are very poor, they are still constantly striving to improve. When visiting Peiping, I also gave a speech to the students there. Students everywhere are enduring great sacrifices in order to study. I have tried to analyze the entire modern China, and the suffering of the people every day concerns me. In the past few years of suffering, I have worked for both China and the United Kingdom. I always remember everything about China. My greatest hope for China is that peace will come soon. We really have this belief and patience to seek the arrival of peace."</p>

<h3 id="e90">How Much Living Expenses Should Be Appropriately Reserved for the Families of Traitors? The Judicial Yuan's Explanation Is Abstract; It Is Difficult for the Enemy Property Bureau to Implement <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>[This Newspaper Report] In the judgments of traitors, the disposition of traitorous property is: "All property will be confiscated, except for the necessary living expenses for family members." However, there is no clear stipulation on how much should be appropriately reserved. The Traitorous Property Group of the Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau submitted a document to the Judicial Yuan for interpretation due to the difficulty of implementation. Now, the Judicial Yuan's Interpretation No. 3213 has been obtained, which states that the so-called "necessary" refers to what is needed for the livelihood of ordinary people in the area where the traitor's family is located. As for how to determine the necessary living expenses to be reserved for family members, the executing agency should investigate and clarify the entire property and the population status of the family before executing. It also stated that "the main text of the judgment may only make an abstract declaration regarding the necessary living expenses for family members." The Traitorous Property Group of the Enemy Property Bureau believes that the above explanation still lacks specific regulations, and it is still difficult to handle it.</p>
<p>The entirety of the confiscated traitorous property includes all the property obtained as a result of committing the crime of treason, and the property originally owned by them. As for the public property among the property obtained, or the private property that should be returned to the victims, it is not included in the confiscation list.</p>
<h3 id="e91">More Than Three Thousand Cases of Plasma Have Been Fully Recovered: Godowns on Szechuan Road and Broadway Road; President of the United Press Accidentally Discovers Them <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>According to a disclosure by a U.S. Navy spokesperson yesterday, he received a notification on November 14th from the Shanghai office of the U.S. Foreign Liquidation Commission, stating that a portion of a large quantity of surplus medicines belonging to the U.S. military in Okinawa, approximately one million tons, including plasma owned by the American Red Cross, was not for public sale. After learning that plasma was being sold at high prices on the black market in this city, the U.S. Navy is now making every effort to assist the Liquidation Commission in buying it back from merchants. The U.S. Navy is aware that Liquidation Commission staff are attempting to prohibit the illegal black market trading of plasma in this city, but according to investigations, such trading is continuing. The Navy spokesperson stated that the Shanghai office of the U.S. Foreign Liquidation Commission is continuing to conduct a strict investigation, attempting to buy back the plasma to prevent illegal trading.</p>
<p>[United Press, Shanghai] The Shanghai office of the U.S. Foreign Surplus Property Disposal Office previously sold plasma to Shanghai merchants and is now trying to recover it and return it to the Red Cross. Although the Chinese buyer has agreed to return it to the U.S. Foreign Surplus Property Disposal Office, this has not yet been implemented. Hapson, the president of the United Press Shanghai branch, and reporter Massa, accidentally discovered more than two thousand cases of this black market plasma in a godown opposite the Cathay Hotel on Szechuan South Road yesterday, and another several hundred cases in another godown. It is expected that all of the more than three thousand five hundred cases of plasma can be recovered. Yesterday, Hapson and Massa were having dinner at the Cathay Hotel on Szechuan South Road when a diner saw that they were news reporters and approached them with a newspaper, pointing out a news item about the recovery of plasma. The diner then said that they were planning to move the plasma out of the godown. Upon hearing this, Hapson and Massa went to the godown to inspect it and saw hundreds of cases of plasma inside a fence. They then learned that there were still hundreds of cases inside the godown and that plans were being made to transport them away by truck. As no U.S. Navy trucks had arrived, they suspected that there might be another plan to transport the plasma to a secret location. They immediately telephoned the Shanghai office of the U.S. Foreign Surplus Property Disposal Office and other U.S. agencies to inquire. They learned that none of them knew anything about moving the plasma. The American authorities here have been trying to find and recover the plasma since October 3rd. Upon hearing the news, they rushed to the godown. Later, the Coast Guard also arrived. Had they been slightly later, it is feared that at least part of the plasma would have been moved. Later, the owner sent a truck to the godown to transport the plasma, but seeing that personnel from the U.S. Foreign Surplus Property Disposal Office were already there, it drove away empty. Mr. Ge, an official from the Disposal Office, even took a photograph of the truck, which had the owner's name painted on it. Mr. Davis, the director of the Shanghai office of the Disposal Office, also came to the godown in person. In addition, several personnel from the American Red Cross also arrived, but declared that they were purely observers. After informal discussions among all parties, it was decided to send a Coast Guard officer to guard outside the godown to prevent the plasma from being moved. Personnel from the Disposal Office and the Red Cross then went to inspect three other godowns, led by someone, in the hope of finding unrecovered plasma. They then found hundreds of cases hidden in a godown on Broadway Road, piled up to the ceiling. Although the exact number is unknown, it is believed that almost all of the plasma intended to be recovered is in these two godowns. As for how much of the plasma has already been sold on the market, it is still unknown. It is said that the attempt to recover the three thousand five hundred cases is likely to be successful. Each case contains twelve bags of plasma, and each bag contains five hundred cc. Mr. Maddy, an official from the China branch of the American Red Cross, told a United Press reporter that the U.S. Navy will be responsible for shipping the plasma to the United States.</p>

<h3 id="e93">Song Park Opens: Over Seventy Acres in Area; Lush with Flowers, Plants, and Trees; Mayor Wu and Others Praise the Park Repeatedly After Visiting <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Song Jiaoren Park, located at the intersection of Gonghe New Road and Song Park Road in Zhabei, has been renovated by the Parks and Fields Management Office of the Public Works Bureau for several months and is now completely new, becoming a scenic spot and historic site for recreation. According to Mr. Cheng Shifu, a specialist from the Public Works Bureau responsible for the renovation of the park, the Jiaoren martyr's tomb field covers approximately one hundred and twenty acres. After receiving it in August this year, a plan was made to arrange the flowers and plants in the grounds. The renovation work started on September 1st and took only one month to complete the current park scenery. The park includes approximately seventy acres of land surrounding the tomb. The rest has been divided into several sections due to the construction of roads. The flowers, plants, and trees in the park are all supplied by the nursery of the Parks and Fields Management Office of the Public Works Bureau. In addition, it is planned to build a memorial hall in the open space behind the tomb, but this is currently difficult to do due to the high cost of building materials. The current simple renovation has already cost 15 million yuan.</p>
<p>The park is scheduled to officially open today. Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, the local press was invited for a preview. Mayor Wu also came to the park at 4:30 PM in the afternoon to inspect it and repeatedly praised it. Zhao Zukang, the director of the Public Works Bureau, Tang Hongshi, the chief secretary, Xu Tianpeng, the director of the Parks and Fields Management Office, Zheng Tianmu, the director of the Personnel Department, and Yin Tiyang, the director of the Materials Allocation Department, also attended. They were all warmly received by Qian Weifan, a specialist from the Public Works Bureau, and Cheng Shifu, a specialist, and others.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper] Regarding the legendary case of underground materials being concealed on Fuxing Island, the District Procuratorate sent a special letter to the Executive Yuan for inquiry a few days ago. Yesterday, the Executive Yuan replied to the District Procuratorate, stating in brief: The case has been handed over to Xu Fuqi, the chairman of the Morning Industry Committee of the Executive Yuan, for investigation. According to his reply, there are two points: (1) There are no clues to be found in this case, as the committee has not found any underground tunnels on Fuxing Island at all. At the same time, after a thorough search of the archives, the Agricultural Committee never sent anyone to Fuxing Island to handle the takeover, so the "takeover personnel" mentioned by the District Procuratorate could not have handled it. (2) Fuxing Island was not taken over by the Executive Yuan at the beginning of the victory. It was borrowed from the Naval authorities after the Executive Yuan requested it and was approved by the National Defense Conference. At the same time, the District Procuratorate also sent a general letter to the Songhu Garrison Command summoning the original informant in the case, Yang Biting. Yesterday, the Garrison Command also replied, stating: "This headquarters does not have this person. The summons is returned herewith." It is generally believed that the case may end without resolution.</p>

<p>The chrysanthemum exhibition held by the Municipal Public Works Bureau in Fuxing Park will be on its last day today. The reporter made a special trip to visit it last night. According to the person in charge of the chrysanthemum exhibition office, the total number of visitors to the chrysanthemum exhibition has reached 300,000, and the ticket revenue has reached 600,000 yuan. A total of 2,000 pots of chrysanthemums of approximately 200 varieties were on display. Most of the citizens who came to see them were young women, who took pictures against the scenery to leave their beautiful figures among the myriad chrysanthemums. The chrysanthemums currently displayed in the park have been mostly damaged by the continuous wind and blows. As the reporter walked out of the park gate, he suddenly recalled the poem by a predecessor: "Don't blame me for preferring chrysanthemums; no flowers bloom after this flower fades," which could not help but evoke the desolate feeling of "the year's floral affairs have come to an end."</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper] Zhang Shengchu, a native of Wuxi, 39 years old, was previously a clerk at the Jiangsu Province Goods Tax Bureau of the Ministry of Finance. He has now been dismissed and is unemployed in Shanghai. The other day, he actually came up with a bizarre idea: to forge tax bureau seals and official documents. He went to Room 405 of the East Asia Hotel, the Shanghai office of the North China Sales Department of the Great China Match Company, and showed the seals and other credentials, requesting a temporary loan of 3 million yuan, claiming that he was a tax bureau official and that the amount could be deducted when taxes were paid in the future. The representative of the office, He Ruixiang, saw through the scheme and handed him over to the Old Gate Branch Bureau. According to his confession, he had previously defrauded the Fucheng Enterprise Company on Ningbo Road of 1 million legal tender using the same method and spent it. The preliminary trial confirmed the facts. He will be sent to the District Procuratorate this morning for further investigation.</p>
<h3 id="e98">The Declining Employment Agencies: Servants' Wages are High, and Introduction Fees are Even Higher; The Industry Association Plans to Request Unified Management <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Special] Before the war, Chinese labor was worthless. Wages in production industries were pitifully low. Foreigners classified Chinese exports as colonial goods, meaning that the labor costs of these commodities were as low as those extracted from colonial labor. In many industries, using modern machinery was not as cheap as using manual labor. The treatment of domestic servants further revealed the cheapness of labor. In Shanghai in 1937, it cost only 2 to 4 yuan per month to hire an ordinary maid, and a wet nurse cost only about 10 yuan. Therefore, it was not uncommon for a family of moderate means to hire two or three workers.</p>
<p>Wages Rise High</p>
<p>Nine years later, everything has changed dramatically. The cost of Chinese labor is at least comparable to that of the United States. High wages in Chinese production industries are already known worldwide. In terms of the treatment of domestic servants, at least in Shanghai, it has made it daunting for small and medium-sized families to hire servants. Today, in Shanghai, hiring a male servant to do ordinary work in the house, in addition to providing food and accommodation, costs 40,000 to 60,000 yuan per month. The cost of female workers is even higher, reaching 70,000 to 80,000 yuan per month, in addition to food and accommodation. If a female worker is slightly knowledgeable, literate, and able to cook and do laundry, she may earn more than 100,000 yuan in a wealthy family. Therefore, if calculated in terms of rice prices, the "real wages" of domestic servants are indeed much better than before the war. As for servants with special skills or uses, their compensation is even more generous. A chef who can cook both Chinese and Western dishes can earn more than 200,000 yuan per month, and ordinary ones can earn more than 100,000 yuan. A wet nurse who has passed the examination can earn about 150,000 yuan per month, and ordinary ones can earn about 120,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Great Differences Between Past and Present</p>
<p>Today, there is an industry in society that exists based on these domestic servants, and that is the employment agency, also known as the "go-between shop." From a statistical point of view, this industry is in decline. In this city, there were more than 400 agencies around 1927, but only more than 200 before 1937. The difficult life during the war forced these people to do small businesses or to sell their original houses to do other businesses. Today, there are only 70 employment agencies left in Shanghai. Business is now sluggish, with only about 1,000 people being introduced each month, most of whom are maids. All servants introduced by the agency are accompanied by a guarantee, which is kept in the employer's home and checked every six months without additional fees. Servants introduced by the agency must work for at least three months after the wages have been agreed upon. If they leave before the term expires, the agency is obligated to find someone else to replace them.</p>
<p>Introduction Fees are Appalling</p>
<p>The economic source of the agency is the so-called "introduction fee," which is well known. After the servant and the employer have agreed on the wages, the agency will ask for the introduction fee. Before the war, the introduction fee was borne equally by the master and servant, but now it is paid solely by the employer. How much should the introduction fee be? This is a question that has not been resolved to this day. Before the war, the introduction fee was half of the wages. During the enemy-puppet era, the introduction fee was as high as eight times the wages! What about now? It depends on the employment situation and is not uniform. There is a shocking rumor that a wealthy family actually paid an introduction fee of 200,000 yuan! The general situation is 20,000 to 30,000 yuan, with some bargaining involved. Recently, the Employment Agency Association has submitted a request to the Social Affairs Bureau, hoping that the introduction fee can be equal to the amount of the wages. However, given the high wages in this city, they would be very satisfied if they could get half of the requested amount. In fact, if the introduction fee is too high, families willing to hire people will not go through the agency, and this industry will inevitably decline.</p>
<p>The Association Wants to Unify</p>
<p>The main difficulty for employment agencies today is that people in general are very annoyed with the introduction fee. They have now switched to the method of "servants introducing servants" and are unwilling to patronize the servant introduction agency anymore. Therefore, this industry is in a major recession, and it is difficult for each agency to maintain itself. Especially in many larger agencies, it is even more difficult to support several employees. Now, the industry association is preparing to request the competent authority to uniformly stipulate the amount of the introduction fee in the future and not to allow excessive demands. At the same time, the employment of servants must go through the agency. They believe that doing so can immediately achieve the benefit of lower wages. They point out that the high wages of domestic servants in this city are mainly due to the increase in wages by wealthy families after the victory. At the same time, the lack of statistics on supply and demand in the city due to servants introducing servants is also one of the reasons. According to them, if unified management can be carried out in the future, it can somewhat stabilize wages. Recently, the Shanghai Vocational Introduction Office of the Ministry of Social Affairs has had preliminary contact with the industry association and has requested some materials, which may be the beginning of government management. In fact, this industry is in decline because the past business methods are too old and have not truly served the society. To make this industry continue to exist, it needs public guidance and supervision.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper] The British commercial delegation to China arrived in Shanghai from Hankou at 2:30 PM yesterday and landed at Jiangwan Airport. The delegation's secretary, Pelliga, arrived in Shanghai on the 13th. After the delegation arrives in Shanghai for the second time, it will stay here for more than ten days to complete its unfinished work and is scheduled to fly to Taiwan on the 29th of this month.</p>
<p>Reception for Reporters Before Leaving Hankou</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hankou, 15th] The British commercial delegation to China held a press conference at the British Consulate General at 5:30 PM this afternoon and replied to reporters that the United Kingdom will take all possible steps to increase its foreign trade. Currently, more than 80 percent of British industries have returned to normal, and its exports have already exceeded the amount in 1938. This achievement has been achieved by restricting domestic consumption. The United Kingdom is currently extremely short of food and raw materials and hopes to obtain them from China. However, the current situation prevents us from achieving this wish. There are three reasons: (1) Prices are too high. The prices of Chinese goods are now three to six times higher than before the war (calculated at the exchange rate). (2) Transportation costs are too high. (3) The war in China not only damages transportation and affects the distribution of imported materials, but also greatly reduces the products that the United Kingdom urgently needs. Regarding trade in the Yangtze River basin, the United Kingdom will continue to attach importance to it.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper] Kohlberg, a member of the American China Policy Association and the current treasurer of the association, came to China last week and recently went to Beijing. Yesterday, he returned to Shanghai and met with reporters at his residence. According to him, the mission of this trip to China, in addition to private business affairs, is also to be responsible for collecting some information for the China Policy Association.</p>
<p>When the reporter asked what kind of information it was, Cobb refused to disclose it, only saying that he had met with Madam Chiang Kai-shek and Chen Lifu in Beijing and jokingly said, "Some Americans think of Mr. Chen Lifu as a mysterious figure, but what I (Cobb referring to himself) saw was a thin and gentle person. I mentioned this to Mr. Chen when I met him, and Mr. Chen laughed." Cobb has submitted the topics of the information he wants to collect to the relevant parties and will have them mailed to the United States after it has been collected. He himself is unable to wait and is scheduled to return to the United States on Tuesday this week.</p>
<p>Cobb also talked to the reporter about the general situation of the China Policy Association, saying that the association was officially established in June or July this year and its purpose is to help the American people understand the situation in China and study the correct China policy. In addition, it closely monitors the activities of communist elements in various countries. The chairman of the association is Mr. Powell, the editor of the China Weekly Review, the vice chairman is the famous American missionary Mr. Fish, and there are a total of sixty standing members, most of whom are legal and political leaders, writers, editors, and people who know and have a good impression of China. In September of this year, the association submitted a letter to President Truman suggesting four points: (1) Immediately demand that the Soviet Union abandon the special rights it obtained in China in the Yalta Agreement. (2) Condemn the actions of the Chinese Communist Party and stop all support for the CCP. (3) Fully support the Chinese National Government. (4) Reorganize the Far East Division of the State Department and appoint personnel who are in line with foreign policy. This recommendation was submitted through the President's Secretary and had a considerable impact. However, Cobb finally told the reporter that the United States' China policy is still undecided, and there is still disagreement between the President and the Congress. The differences may be eliminated and finalized within a year, otherwise, it will have to wait until the next general election.</p>

<p>To the Editor: Having read your esteemed newspaper's November 1st first page news column which stated my name was associated with Mao Yunhui in the transport and sale of salt, this is inconsistent with the facts. The reason is that I went to Xuzhou on business last month to settle accounts and traveled on the same wheel to Pukou with the said Mao Yunyao, after which we separated. The salt matter has nothing to do with me. I am afraid it is a misunderstanding of hearsay. Please check and make a correction.

<p>City Council Political Committee held its fourth meeting yesterday at 3:00 PM in the council's meeting room. More than ten people, including Ji, attended, and Police Chief Tie Wu also attended. Zhang Jiu served as the chairman. After the meeting began, the Chief first reported on the actual situation of the disciplinary case. Chief Xuan stated: "In order to thoroughly resolve the issue of rectifying police discipline, we have decided to proceed in four aspects: (1) Improving quality; (2) Improving treatment; (3) Strengthening training; (4) Emphasizing rewards and punishments." The discussion began regarding the prevalence of fundraising associations in this city. Chen stated that the wind of such associations is strong. However, it should be prohibited for general public officials to borrow the name, or for local ruffians to rely on their power to extort money from the people through the method of "beating the autumn wind." However, the original proposer was unable to attend the meeting to state the reasons, and it was inconvenient to delete or modify the original proposal, so it was decided to retain it for discussion at the next meeting. Later, Qiang Qian temporarily suggested to Chief Xuan that the order of getting on and off trams and buses was too chaotic, and the elderly, children, and women were suffering from the inability to get on the bus. He asked if the police station could send personnel to maintain order and stipulate that all people waiting for the bus at each station must line up to board the bus. Chief Xuan immediately agreed, and the meeting adjourned at 5:00 PM.</p>
<p>In addition, the City Council, in order to strictly prohibit usury, in addition to submitting a request to the Executive Yuan, specifically telegraphed all provincial and municipal councils across the country, requesting consistent implementation. The original telegram is as follows: "XX City Council Public Oversight Committee, after investigating the loan interest rates of banks, the monthly interest rate before the war was only one percent, but in recent years the interest rate has soared to five percent, which is already alarming. After the victory, due to abnormal fluctuations in prices and speculative manipulation, some people have spared no effort to raise interest rates in order to determine the success or failure of the moment, creating high black market interest rates, which have exceeded twenty percent. If this trend is not curbed, the entire legitimate industry and commerce will collapse. The depth of the crisis is beyond imagination. The fourth meeting of the Social Affairs Committee of this council proposed to request the central government to issue a general order to the banking industry to clearly stipulate legal interest rates, and to telegraph all councils across the country to respond in unison, and to jointly telegraph the central government to call for a swift and effective ban on usury to save the industrial and commercial crisis and remedy social ills. The case was resolved to telegraph all provincial and municipal councils across the country to respond to the call and record it in the minutes. In addition to telegraphing the Executive Yuan, we also telegraph your council to take note of and jointly telegraph to resolve the industrial and commercial crisis. We are extremely hopeful and prayerful. Shanghai City Council Speaker Pan Gongzhan (Cheng) (Said) respectfully."</p>
<h3 id="e108">Zhang Sumin Sentenced to Ten Years in Prison; Zhang Tao Scheduled for Sentencing on the 23rd; Former Puppet Police Station Detective Chen Jinsheng Acquitted <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Zhang Sumin, who once served as the director of the puppet Jianghai Customs Office and the director of the puppet Enemy Property Management Committee, was sentenced to ten years of imprisonment and ten years of deprivation of civil rights by the High Court yesterday. All of his property, except for the necessary living expenses for his family, was confiscated. In addition, Chen Jinsheng, who was accused of serving as a detective at the puppet police station, was acquitted by the court, which believed that the staff of the former Public Concession Police Department could not constitute the crime of treason, and that he had not engaged in any actions detrimental to the country or the people while continuing to serve in the puppet police station.</p>
<p>On the same day, the trial of Zhang Tao, the former president of the puppet Supreme Court, was scheduled for sentencing on the 23rd of this month. Zhang is currently sixty-one years old and a native of Xiaoshan, Zhejiang. When Liang Hongzhi, Wen Zongyao, and others organized the puppet Reformed Government in the twenty-seventh year, he immediately took office as a puppet legislator and concurrently as the chairman of the puppet Economic Committee. When Wang Jingwei, Chen Gongbo, and others organized the puppet National Government in the twenty-ninth year, he transferred to serve as the president of the puppet Supreme Court. He was arrested after the victory and prosecuted by the High Procuratorate. The High Court has held several hearings to investigate. Yesterday morning, a collegial panel was convened for trial. The defendant was escorted to the court from prison by bailiffs. His hair was already gray, and he wore an old-fashioned pair of glasses on his nose and a blue silk robe. He argued a lot about the charges against him, claiming that he participated in the puppet government under duress and that the laws used during the puppet organization period were still those set before the war and had not been changed. He also denied being a member of the Kuomintang, saying that the reason he confessed to being a member of the Kuomintang when he was detained by the Military Statistics Bureau was out of fear of being considered a member of a different party.</p>

<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Chen Junqing, a native of Yancheng who opened the Guohua Barber Shop on Mongol Road in Zhabei, was recently reported to the Shanghai County Government Police Bureau for suspicion of treason. On the 8th of this month, the bureau dispatched two detectives, Zhao Bugao and Xu Lihe, from the Minhang Police Station, carrying documents to Shanghai, and went to the address with the Zhabei Branch Bureau to arrest Chen and take him back to Minhang for interrogation. Unexpectedly, on the 11th, Zhao and Xu went to Chen's shop again and told his brother, Yongqing, that the case would be handled according to law, but if he could pay 10 million yuan as a reward, he could guarantee that his brother would be acquitted and released. After negotiations between the two parties at the Qinghe Tea Garden on Mongol Road, an agreement was reached for 5 million yuan. It was agreed that the money and the person would be exchanged at 12 noon on the 12th. Afterwards, Chen's brother reported the information to the Zhabei Branch Bureau and prepared a bundle of legal tender with 5-yuan and 10-yuan notes on the outside, falsely posing as 1 million yuan, and two Zhejiang Quangong checks for 3 million yuan dated the 15th and 1 million yuan dated the 18th.

After being taken to the bureau for interrogation, he confessed to the above-mentioned criminal facts. In order to clarify the truth of the case, the police bureau has sent a letter to the county police bureau for investigation.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Municipal Party Department, in view of the fact that during the period of occupation, people in the Shanghai film and drama industry were unable to relocate inland, and many people remained in Shanghai to work.

<h3 id="e128">Embezzlement by Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CRRRA) Treasurer: Private Lending at High Interest Rates; Authorities Thoroughly Investigate the Truth; More Than One Person Involved; Wu Suiren Under Strict Surveillance <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>[Reported by Our Newspaper] Regarding the case of Wu Suiren, treasurer of the General Affairs Section of the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CRRRA), embezzling 2.7 billion yuan of public funds for private lending at high interest rates, our reporter learned yesterday that the case is quite complex and involves more than just Wu Suiren. The authorities at the CRRRA are currently conducting a thorough investigation.</p>
<p>It is understood that the CRRRA discovered Wu Suiren's embezzlement two weeks ago. In October of this year, the Executive Yuan, based on the basic agreement between China and the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA), allocated 3.2 billion yuan to the CRRRA as this year's regular expenses for UNRRA in China. The funds were advanced by the Executive Yuan and paid by the National Treasury Bureau of the Central Bank. However, aside from 500 million yuan that was remitted to the General Affairs Section of the CRRRA in Shanghai, the remaining 2.7 billion yuan was directly remitted to Wu Suiren himself. After receiving the remittance, Wu immediately cashed the drafts at the Central Bank, which paid him with cashier's checks. Wu then used the funds for private lending at high interest rates. Initially, the matter was not discovered. However, at the beginning of this month, the authorities at the CRRRA inquired with the Finance Department of the CRRRA in Nanjing about the funds. They were told that the funds had already been remitted. The CRRRA immediately sent personnel to Nanjing to investigate, while also conducting inquiries in Shanghai. This led to the discovery of the truth. The CRRRA then ordered Wu Suiren to return all of the original funds and dismissed him from his position. However, the details of Wu's lending and the amount of interest he collected are still under investigation. Although Wu Suiren has not been detained, he is under strict surveillance by the authorities.</p>

<p>[Reported by Our Newspaper] In order to suppress oil prices and promote oil mill production, Mayor Wu convened a meeting yesterday morning at 10:00 AM in the City Hall conference room, bringing together all parties related to edible oil to discuss the matter. Those in attendance were: Ji Mingzhai, Section Chief of the Food Department of the Social Affairs Bureau; He Molin of the Central Trust of China; Xie Yuxiang of the Oil Mill Association; Chuan Changyu of the Miscellaneous Grain and Oil Cake Association; Zhang Chao of the Retail Miscellaneous Grain and Oil Cake Association; Li Tingdong of the China Vegetable Oil Factory; and representatives from Taiwan Corporation Trading Company, among others. Mayor Wu stated: The current difficulties faced by the oil pressing industry are nothing more than the slow sales of soybean cake, the shortage of raw materials, and insufficient funds. Now, an agreement has been reached with the Central Trust of China to purchase soybean cake. Starting from the 18th of this month until the 17th of next month, the Central Trust will initially purchase 120,000 cakes produced by various private factories, at a price of 10,500 yuan per cake. After purchasing them, the Central Trust will engage in barter trade with Taiwan Province. In terms of raw materials, the Central Trust will find ways to purchase soybeans in Dalian, Sipingjie, Changchun, Yingkou, and other places in Northeast China to supply to various factories as raw materials for oil pressing. As for the issue of funding for oil pressing, the City Bank has now arranged a loan of 500 million yuan to be used by various oil mills for purchasing raw materials. Regarding the production costs of edible oil, Mayor Wu has instructed the China Vegetable Oil Factory to be responsible for compiling a production cost table for submission and verification, to be used as a reference during price negotiations.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Mayor Wu was extremely angered by the rampant black market trading of edible oil. However, yesterday, the black market trading of oil was almost completely absent. It is expected that after the full allocation of oil by various oil mills starting yesterday, the price of edible oil will stabilize.</p>

<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] The Textile Industry Management Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs issued the following two orders to the Textile Industry Association on the 16th, which were then forwarded to various yarn factories:</p>
<p>(1) Factories that ship goods without selling them under the guise of exporting yarn should report the types, quantities, and destinations of the yarn to the association for verification before shipment.</p>
<p>(2) Factories that exchange yarn for cloth with cloth factories, which is equivalent to raising yarn prices in reality, are ordered to be strictly prohibited by the association.</p>

<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] The City Government, due to the recent cotton yarn transactions in the city still exceeding normal circumstances, has specifically stipulated measures to be corrected by the Yarn Industry Association and the Police and Social Affairs Bureaus. The measures are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Cotton yarn transactions must be held within the association's market. Any transaction found to be conducted outside the market will be severely punished.</p>
<p>(2) The association shall register in detail the names, addresses, types, values, and quantities of both parties in each transaction within the market on a daily basis for easy verification.</p>
<p>(3) If a buyer intends to export cotton yarn, he must truthfully register with the association on a daily basis the type, quantity, and destination of the yarn for verification.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market completely stagnated. A notice from Chairman Wu, Mayor of the Textile Management Committee, was posted in the market, strictly prohibiting all transactions exceeding the price limit. Members of the yarn industry could only sit and bear the expenses, abandoning all illegal profits. Except for a small amount of 10-count coarse yarn that was traded at the price limit, there were no transactions for 20-count yarn or higher. The general customers were willing to pay higher prices to buy goods, but they could not obtain them. The price-limited yarn formed a situation of having a price but no market.</p>
<p>The cloth market has been fluctuating violently for several days, especially yesterday's market price. In addition, the Textile Construction's opening price has also been adjusted, so the people's sentiment is unanimously upward. Dragon-head fine cloth shouted prices of 89,000 yuan to 90,000 yuan. Traders from both the North and South are doing their best to purchase spot goods in order to wait for the ship to load. The colored cloths of the various factories have also risen by about 10,000 yuan.</p>

<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] The Cotton Yarn Joint Distribution Committee convened a meeting yesterday at 11:30 AM at the Sixth District Cotton Textile Association and adjourned at 3:00 PM. During the meeting, the members discussed the fact that the third phase of yarn distribution was coming to an end. They discussed the measures for the fourth phase of yarn distribution in order to recommend them to the Textile Management Committee. In addition, the members noted that the current production volume of cotton yarn in various yarn factories in the city is lower than the previously estimated monthly production volume of 65,000 pieces. Therefore, they plan to propose to the Textile Management Committee to adjust the yarn allocation. Regarding the matter of various associations returning replica products, it is proposed to reveal the difficulties of both parties and show mutual understanding. Finally, the members noted that many yarn factories also weave cotton cloth. Therefore, a portion of the cotton yarn from the total yarn production should be reserved for the factory's own cloth production needs. The proposal was voted on and implemented.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 16th] The Ministry of Finance announced: The commodity tax on wheat flour was originally planned to be levied on both mechanized and semi-mechanized wheat flour.

<p>The rice market's supply slightly decreased, with the registered total for both northern and southern markets reaching over 10,000 stones.

<h3 id="e141">Amidst Rumors of Yarn and Cloth Being Shipped South; Actual Sales in Guangdong and Hong Kong Decline; Hong Kong Smuggled Goods Also Inhibit Themselves <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>[Reported by this Newspaper] Guangzhou City Chamber of Commerce representatives He Jiping, He Xizhang, Fujian Provincial Chamber of Commerce representatives Lin Zhongmin, Luo Pingzong, Wei Zhao, etc., who went to Beijing this time to attend the National Federation of Industry and Commerce, took advantage of passing through Shanghai to visit Liu Wenteng, director of the Business Department of the Textile Management Committee, and made two requests: (1) Please expand the amount of yarn and cloth already approved for shipment to the South. (2) The transportation and sales of yarn and cloth to the South should be handled by people dispatched by the Guangdong and Fujian Chambers of Commerce respectively. Mr. Liu responded separately. Regarding the first point, the Textile Management Committee has recently expanded the approved amount as originally decided. Moreover, October is still the first trial run, and necessary adjustments can be made later by measuring the situation. Regarding the second point, anyone who meets the qualifications of the transporters stipulated by the Textile Management Committee can operate, so it is not necessary to adhere to any one side. As for the recent situation of yarn and cloth being shipped south, according to the investigation by the Textile Management Committee, there are two points worthy of attention: (1) Since the ban on the shipment of yarn and cloth to South China, Guangzhou has once felt an extreme lack of yarn and cloth, and prices have soared, differing from yarn prices in Shanghai by up to 1 million yuan, becoming the highest peak for yarn and cloth in the country. With merchants seeing the profit potential, they devised ways to transport goods by land, using (A) the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway as a base, passing through Jiangxi, Fujian, and reaching Meixian, Xingning, and transferring by waterway to Guangzhou. (B) From Wuhan via the Yuehan Railway to Hunan, transferring to Qujiang to Guangzhou. (C) Others directly mailed parcels from Shanghai to Wuzhou, Guangxi, and then returned to Guangzhou by waterway. Mailing to Wuzhou. Since the receiving time is not confirmed, it is easily affected by fluctuations in the current price, so there are fewer incoming goods. The Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway is easier and cheaper to transport, so among the three routes, the Yuehan Railway has the most incoming goods, averaging 100 pieces per day. (2) In the past, Guangzhou's yarn and cloth could be sold to Qian and Gui and as far north as Hunan Ganzhou and other places, in addition to being sold to Hong Kong and the South Seas. Recently, because the arrival route for yarn and cloth passes through the above-mentioned places first and then reaches Guangzhou, the outer markets do not need to go to Guangzhou to purchase any more, so sales are smaller than before. As for Hong Kong and the South Seas, Hong Kong's ban on yarn and cloth exports has suddenly blocked the door to smuggling to the South Seas. The Annam government has also restricted the import of goods and required the settlement of foreign exchange. The exchange rate of 1.1 Vietnamese dong per Hong Kong dollar on the black market was raised to 1.7 per 1, making the transport of yarn and cloth to Vietnam not only unprofitable, but actually causing losses. As a result, yarn and cloth prices in Hong Kong are lower than in Guangzhou. With weak sales in the South Seas and Hong Kong, the wind of smuggling has also decreased spontaneously. The number of tax bureaus that have applied for separate shipments to ports that can be smuggled, such as Shiqi Yangjiang, Siyi, Zhanjiang, Shiqiao, and Zhangmutou, has also gradually decreased.</p>

<p>Gold was initially under pressure and lower, but the general mentality was very optimistic, and the rebound was weak, remaining fairly strong. The opening price was 2,505,000. After opening, many long positions were closed for profit, and soon retreated into 2,500,000. Pressure also came, and due to the registration allocation relationship, the buying of actual sales was slightly exhausted. It once fell to around 2,475,000. The Central Bank allocated 200 bars at a price of 2,485,000. After 10:00, the situation stabilized and hovered. At 10:30, the buying wind rose again, and immediately rebounded to above 2,500,000. The demand was doubled, and the supply was slightly silent. Near noon, it gradually rose to 2,547,000. At noon, it was around 2,540,000. In the afternoon, it was slightly lowered to below 2,530,000. As a result, it rose by another 30,000 compared to the previous close. Jewelry hung high to 260,000. Silver and silver dollars rose again. The secret short-term interest rate was peaceful, and the interest rate was still between 12% and 15%.</p>
<p>Foreign currency continued to advance. The black market for US dollars was initially as low as 4,750 yuan, and near noon it approached 4,900 yuan again. A part of the new buyers sought advancement in Hong Kong dollars, so the strength of the buyers was slightly dispersed. As a result, it remained between 4,800 yuan and 4,900 yuan in the end, continuing to rise compared to the previous close. Hong Kong notes were boosted by the impact of the Shanghai exchange rate report and the buying enthusiasm for gold, rising sharply by 20 yuan. Hong Kong telegraphic transfers also rose to 940 yuan to 950 yuan, Indian remittances were 1,150 yuan to 1,160 yuan, and British remittances were 15,200 yuan to 15,300 yuan. Transactions were not smooth, and the US exchange rate remained sluggish.</p>

<p>According to Mr. Li Lixia, Director of the Auditing Department of the Central Bank: The deposit reserve ratio of commercial banks and money shops can be adjusted within the specified range according to market conditions. Recently, the deposits paid by various banks and money shops in this city are the highest amount of the statutory deposit reserve ratio, with demand deposits at 20% and time deposits at 15%. In order to regulate finance, this bank plans to reduce the deposit reserve ratio to 15% for demand deposits and 10% for time deposits. It has already reported this to the Ministry of Finance for approval. According to the current difficulties of the industrial and commercial sectors, they are nothing more than (1) too much expenditure, (2) too high interest rates. It is hoped that after the reduction of the deposit reserve ratio is realized, the market interest rate will be lowered at the same time. This is a necessary task for stabilizing the market. It is reported that it is estimated that after the reduction of the deposit reserve ratio by 5% for commercial banks and money shops in Shanghai, liquidity can increase by about 100 billion yuan.</p>

<p>The 7 billion yuan loan for green tea production previously issued by China National Agricultural Corporation (CNAC) was due to expire in September. Later, due to problems such as transportation and commodity tax not being resolved, the green tea from Tunxi and Pingshu has not arrived in port to this day. As a result, the loan period has also been extended to the present in an invisible way. It is now known that the CNAC and tea merchants have agreed to a pledge loan method to solve the above-mentioned difficulties. In the future, after the CNAC coordinates exports, the proceeds will be used to offset the production loan. In addition, it is heard that the CNAC and tea merchants will handle this batch of new green tea with precision and select a foreign key. As for the matter of the CNAC purchasing tea from you, there is no certainty.</p>

<p>Recently, rumors of foreign exchange adjustments have been spreading, and it is also said that sixty to seventy foreign ships have arrived in port, carrying a large number of commercial goods that need to be settled in US dollars. Speculators have added fuel to the fire, and the black market for US dollars has soared.

<p>The retail trade of woolen fabrics did not see much improvement yesterday. Although clothing stores and shops have successively lowered prices to attract customers, there has not been much development. This is because the public's purchasing power has indeed been weakened due to various environmental factors. However, long pile velvet, Shanghai Bailong, sells quite well. Women's clothing stores all have decorations, because winter women's coats are still popular. The arrival of foreign goods is lacking, and local factory production is not high. At the tea fair, the trend is like a crane standing among chickens. Yesterday, the wholesale price of imported long pile velvet was 130,000 to 140,000 yuan per yard, and the local factory price was 95,000 yuan.</p>

<p>This year's spring and autumn silkworm cocoon harvests in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces were poor, causing great concern about raw materials for various silk factories. Recently, silk factories in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces have been forced to suspend operations, accounting for one-third of the total, due to the exhaustion of raw materials and the inability to continue operations. The factories are now requesting the China Silkworm Corporation to allocate the dry cocoons collected by the corporation to substitute reeling in order to maintain the livelihoods of the factories' employees. It is heard that, in order to improve production, the corporation will allow silk factories with rotary multi-end reeling machines to be allocated cocoons for substitute reeling. Yesterday, the corporation sent technician Zou to various factories to investigate the number of rotary multi-end reeling machines. Once the investigation is completed, the total number will be reported and allocated proportionally based on the number of machines in each factory.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau, upon order from the Ministry of Education regarding the accommodation of national middle school restoration students, has issued another notice to all public and private secondary schools in the city to comply. The original text is as follows: According to the Ministry of Education's order No. 21619 (Zhong) dated September 25 of this year, "After the restoration of national secondary schools, all students should report to the education departments of their original places of residence and wait for assignment to schools. This has already been ordered to be followed. However, due to transportation difficulties, national middle school restoration students cannot return to their hometowns on time. The education departments should accommodate them at any time and should not refuse to accommodate them on the grounds of being overdue. Even if the reporting is overdue, they must be given the opportunity to audit classes. In the second semester, they will be formally assigned to grades. Furthermore, if these students were originally publicly funded, they should continue to enjoy public funding. In addition to separate distribution, this order should be strictly followed." Later, according to telegraph No. 2173 (Zhong) of the same day, "Recently, national secondary school restoration students from various places have submitted petitions, stating that they have returned to the capital in compliance with the Ministry's order or have arrived at the service location of their parents. After applying to the education departments for admission to schools, the education departments have made excuses to delay or have been slow to assign them. After arriving at the school, the schools have often refused to accommodate them because they are full, resulting in difficulties in advancing or retreating and displacement. It has already been ordered that the students of national secondary schools should be assigned to schools by the provincial and municipal education departments of their original places of residence or the service location of their parents. The public funds for these students and the salaries for the teachers and staff will be allocated separately to the provinces, cities, and municipal departments. Even if there are special difficulties, they should try their best to comply and ensure that restoration students enter school at any time, so as not to lose sight of the central government's emphasis on youth education. In addition to separate telegrams, this telegram should be followed and the compliance situation should be reported." Upon receiving this order, in addition to separate distribution, this order should be followed by the school and the compliance situation should be reported.</p>

<p>— Special Correspondent of This Newspaper from Hangzhou</p>
<p>The Arduous and Heroic Defense of Datong</p>
<p>At 3:00 PM on November 2nd, the reporter group flew from Zhangjiakou to Datong, which had been under siege for 45 days. The flight took one hour. Representatives from all circles of Datong had been waiting at the airfield for a long time. A melodious military band played a welcoming tune. A general with two golden stars glittering on his collar, a neatly trimmed gray mustache, and a face full of smiles, shook hands warmly with each reporter and exchanged cordial greetings, saying, "Your arrival is wonderful! Truly wonderful!" He was Chu Xichun, the hero who defended Datong, the Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Eighth Army Group and Commander of the 43rd Army.</p>
<p>The entire city of Datong was swept by a wave of welcome upon our arrival. From the airfield to the city gate, lines of elementary and middle school students respectfully lined the streets, holding up welcoming flags and shouting welcoming slogans. Inside the city, welcoming slogans were plastered on every wall, and every resident seemed to have the word "Welcome" written on their emaciated faces. In those cursed days, Datong suffered greatly. Now, as we sit beside the warm fire in the reception hall, the Yuzhong Hotel, listening quietly to General Chu Xichun recount the events of the battle, it is truly an epic of sorrow and heroism!</p>
<p>An Epic of Sorrow and Heroism</p>
<p>Datong, once the capital of the Northern Wei Dynasty, contains the Nine Dragon Wall, the Upper and Lower Huayan Temples within the city, and the Yungang Grottoes thirty miles from the city, all of which are ancient relics over a thousand years old. Located between the inner and outer Great Wall, it is a crucial hub on the Ping-Sui Railway and the starting point of the Tong-Pu Railway. Dominating northern Shanxi, it has long been a vital military stronghold, its gain or loss directly affecting the safety of the Central Plains. After Japan surrendered last year, the National Army received it with airborne troops on September 3rd. The Communist Army, feeling that the existence of Datong was a major obstacle to their control of Shanxi and Suiyuan, and the consolidation of Rehe and Chahar, was determined to seize it.</p>
<p>The official day that Datong was besieged was August 3rd, but the actual fighting should be considered to have started on June 16th, when the Communist Army launched the offensive in northern Shanxi. Shuoxian fell, followed by the occupation of Shanyin. The soldiers and civilians of Datong had already sensed the premonition and were making preparations to meet the enemy: concentrating forces, mobilizing the people, and storing grain and fuel. To concentrate forces, the National Army painfully withdrew from important industrial areas such as Kouquan and Pingwang, and resolutely defended several relatively strategic strongholds in the vicinity of Datong, which were Shaling, Caifulou, Beiyuemiao, and the railway station, centered around the airfield. These strongholds were intended to give the outstretched "devil's claws" a "deterrent blow."</p>
<p>We should pay attention to the comparison of the forces of the two sides. On the Communist Army side, participating were the so-called elite field divisions 1, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 18, 358, and 359, a total of thirty-two regiments, approximately 50,000 troops. On the National Army side, Chu Xichun commanded a mixed force: the 38th Division, the 5th Cavalry Division of the Northeast Advance Army, the 6th Division, the Transportation Police Corps, the Security Brigade, the Signal Battalion, and the Self-Defense Force, totaling about 20,000 troops. When survival is threatened, even a coward can become very brave. This mixed force, under the command of Chu Xichun, formed an iron whip, turning the sandy Datong into an impregnable fortress. Military strength alone was not enough. All 300,000 people of Datong, except for the disabled and pregnant women, were mobilized during the defense. At that time, there were two slogans: "Everyone defends themselves, everyone participates in the war!"</p>
<p>The more dangerous the battle became, the closer the hearts of the soldiers and civilians became. Everyone developed a belief: "If we must die, we will die together! Before death comes, we will resist it with all our might!" A total of 281 people died while participating in construction projects and rescue work for the people of Datong.</p>
<p>The Communist Army attacked the four strongholds of Shaling, Caifulou, Beiyuemiao, and the railway station for a long time without success, becoming increasingly frustrated. The initial commander was Yao Zhe. Seeing that it was not working, he was replaced by Xiao Ke, but it was still useless. He Long personally took command, but it was still ineffective. Finally, Nie Rongzhen came. He changed his strategy, abandoning direct assault and using tunnels to approach the defending troops, so that they would either be killed or starved to death. As a result, the defending troops in the four strongholds were surrounded, and all contact with the city was completely cut off. The defenders of Beiyuemiao had a battalion, and Battalion Commander Li Huichuan and the remaining soldiers, after fighting for more than twenty days, were exhausted. Now, without food or drink, they ate grass like wild men, and when thirsty, they drank their own urine. After three days, the Communist Army saw no movement in the temple and thought everyone was dead, so they approached carelessly. A burst of gunfire suddenly erupted from the temple, each bullet hitting someone. This greatly surprised Nie Rongzhen. Finally, he had to resort to a final trick, releasing large amounts of poison gas at each stronghold. The National Army was unprepared, and the defenders of the four strongholds were all poisoned before retreating. As the battle progressed to the edge of the city, Chu Xichun supervised the defense day and night, exhausted to the point where he would lie down on the sofa in his clothes for an hour or two, but would soon be awakened and take his guards to each defense position to comfort and encourage the soldiers. The city's supplies relied solely on the air force dropping ammunition. All materials, except for fuel, were in great shortage. At that time, prices reached an appalling level. The following table compares prices before and after the siege was lifted:</p>
<p>Item Unit Price during Siege Price after Siege Lifted</p>
<p>Millet 1 Dou 20,000 Yuan 4,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Oat 1 Dou 6,000 Yuan 1,900 Yuan</p>
<p>White Flour 1 Jin 3,800 Yuan 700 Yuan</p>
<p>Oat Flour 1 Jin 2,400 Yuan 450 Yuan</p>
<p>Sorghum 1 Dou 6,000 Yuan 1,900 Yuan</p>
<p>Because of this, many people starved to death.</p>
<p>The more difficult the situation became, the more determined the soldiers and civilians were to fight to the end! Chu Xichun was from Lixian County, Hebei Province. The Communist Army mysteriously brought his mother and third uncle from their hometown and threatened them to persuade Chu to surrender, but Chu remained unmoved. The Communist Army then asked people familiar with Chu to write letters persuading him to surrender, but he tore all the letters to pieces.</p>
<p>The Communist Army also promised its soldiers that they could pillage for three days after entering the city! Like the promise made to Japanese soldiers when they attacked Nanjing. If Fu Zuoyi had not decisively sent troops to Jining, Datong would inevitably have been lost. The victory at Jining was also the rescue of Datong. On September 16th, the National Army charged out of Datong, displaying their long-suppressed skills, venting their accumulated resentment on the bullets, killing with great satisfaction. According to the figures released by Chu Xichun, the casualties of the two armies during the 45 days were: more than 20,000 for the Communist Army, and about 2,000 for the National Army.</p>
<p>Chu specially arranged for us to watch a live ammunition drill by his troops. A cooked egg was placed on a brick, and another brick was placed on top of the egg. At a distance of seventy meters, a shot hit the egg squarely, making the shooter a first-class marksman. The egg was then awarded to the shooter to eat. Fifteen soldiers participated in one drill, each limited to three shots. Seven out of the fifteen soldiers hit the egg, and all the others hit the brick. "Are the heads of the Eighth Route Army as big as eggs? Are they as big as bricks?" Chu said excitedly, holding a broken egg, to confirm the certainty of the Datong victory.</p>
<p>Visiting Kouquan and Pingwang</p>
<p>The smiles with which the people of Datong welcomed us were mixed with tears! The Communist Army did not enter the city, so the damage within the city was relatively small. Outside the city, wherever the Communist Army set foot, buildings were reduced to ruins and fields were devastated. Now, out of 300,000 people, more than 80,000 have no clothes, no food, and no home to return to. We went to inspect the battlefield on the outskirts of the city on a new moon night. Shaling, originally a village of 150 households, was reduced to a pile of rubble. A Reuters reporter described it as resembling the "Normandy battlefield." Both Caifulou Temple and Beiyuemiao Temple were historical sites, but both temples had disappeared. Even the mud eyes of the Beiyue Emperor were dug out. The destruction of the train station was as terrible as that of Zhangjiakou.</p>
<p>On November 3rd, we took a special train to Kouquan and Pingwang for inspection. The Yongdingzhuang coal mine in Kouquan, along with the Xinzhou, Meiyukou, Si Jia Liang, Baidong, Si Zhi Gou, Tongbao, and Baojin coal mines, comprised the eight Datong coal mines. During the Japanese occupation, they could produce 8,000 tons of coal per day, supplying the needs of North China. The Pingwang power plant had a capacity of 21,000 kilowatts, the largest in North China. These were all national treasures. When the National Army withdrew, they did not move a single screw. Chu Xichun said it well: "Two brothers quarreling should not destroy the ancestors' property!" But the Communist Army destroyed everything! The eight coal mines are now being mined using old methods, producing only 700 tons of coal per day. The Pingwang power plant is now a dilapidated ruin. Some "busy bodies" believe that the destruction was due to the war. Regardless of how the war started, both the National and Communist Armies were parties to it, but the National Army did not move a hair, while the Communist Army carried out extensive destruction. This is a significant difference, and it allows the people to clearly see their true colors, which cannot be covered up with a single sentence.</p>
<p>We lingered and mourned in both places for a long time before taking a car back to the city. Halfway there, in the swirling yellow sand, suddenly more than 300 workers and their families knelt down in front of our car. This caused my heart to tremble violently. I thought it was the scene of "stopping the road to appeal grievances" that often appeared in old novels.</p>
<p>"Do you have any grievances?" Chu Xichun asked them.</p>
<p>"Uh, Commander-in-Chief..." A few elderly people at the front knelt down again. "The Eighth Route Army..."</p>
<p>"Oh! They are talking about the Eighth Route Army." Chu said, turning back to us, and then he told the workers: "Don't kneel, tell me quickly what you want to say—they are Chinese and foreign journalists who have come specifically to interview you."</p>
<p>We immediately felt ashamed! Endless wars have caused countless tragedies, and what help can writers offer to these victims?</p>
<p>Rain Delays Us in Datong</p>
<p>According to the planned itinerary, we were supposed to return to Nanjing on the 4th, but the special plane suddenly developed a malfunction, so we stayed in Datong for another day. We had some spare time to appreciate the historical sites. Yungang was only recovered on the afternoon of the 3rd, and it was said that the Communist Army had planted many landmines, so it was inconvenient to go. We only visited the Nine Dragon Wall and the Upper and Lower Huayan Temples. The Nine Dragon Wall is made of glazed tiles, and each dragon has a different expression. The Huayan Temple has been turned into a warehouse, so we only saw a few statues.</p>
<p>Commerce in Datong has declined and not yet recovered. Only copper kettles and copper pots are famous products. There are many women with bound feet in the city, said to be refugees who have fled from the countryside. The women in the city like to imitate Beiping, but they are always several decades behind. There is no Peking opera here, only one theater performing Shanxi Bangzi opera, which is full of noisy sounds and not a single sentence can be understood. The Datong Executive Headquarters left when the city was besieged, and returned after the siege was lifted, as if they were also seeking refuge. Regarding the Communist Party representative in the Executive Headquarters, a person from Datong told me a news item: the original Communist Party representative was named Li Bo, and he was a brigade commander in the Communist Army. In the city, he always ran around alone. When the Communist Army besieged the city, this representative disappeared before the government and American representatives left. Later, people discovered that he was serving as the commander of the western part of the city, attacking according to the map! This time, the Communist Party representative has been replaced by another person, who no longer dares to run outside, knowing well how the people of Datong would treat him.</p>
<p>On the 5th, it rained in Datong, making the airfield muddy and impassable. The broken plane could not be repaired, and other planes could not land. The reporter group took the opportunity to go to Jining for inspection, and also sent telegrams to Beiping and Nanjing, requesting that a plane be sent to Jining to pick them up, because the airfield in Jining was better than the one in Datong.

<h3 id="e178">The Smiles and Tears of Andong <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent of This Newspaper in the Northeast, Han Qingtao</p>
<p>Andong Airmail on the 7th</p>
<p>Andong is a good place. It is a national gateway, an industrial center, a mining area, a fishing market, a water and land terminal, and also a scenic area.</p>
<p>Flying from Shenyang to Andong takes only forty minutes. The takeoff is across a vast plain, and after passing Benxi, one enters mountainous terrain. The mountains are barren, and only in the valley areas do some villages and towns occasionally flash into view. Soon, the view opens up again, revealing another plain that stretches to the Yalu River and extends into Korean territory. Andong has arrived.</p>
<p>The climate is better than Shenyang. The fields and trees in Shenyang are already bare, but here one can still see a yellow-green expanse, interspersed with splashes of red leaves. The green waters of the Yalu River flow leisurely, originating from Mount Paektu, winding for two hundred miles, flowing from here into the vast ocean. The scenery is exceptionally beautiful.</p>
<p>Two large iron bridges, different in appearance, span the Yalu River, connecting international transportation. Along the river stands the growing urban area of Andong. Across the river is Sinuiju in Korea, facing each other across the water, with the sound of boat whistles intermingling. The chimneys of our factories, the orderly factory buildings, already show a tendency to overwhelm the other side. From the airplane, looking down at the ground, the two urban areas are connected by the iron bridge, forming the special importance of Andong.</p>
<p>Black Smoke Disappears, Plane Sounds Quiet</p>
<p>The airfield is far to the southwest of the city center. There is a long asphalt road leading from the city to the airfield. Traveling this road, thirty-eight li long, one soon sees the large factories standing along the road, at the foot of Maoer Mountain, on the edge of the Yalu River. In the past, black smoke filled the sky, and the sound of machinery rumbled. Now it is quiet.</p>
<p>In terms of factories, during the puppet Manchukuo period, there were the "Manchuria Automobile Manufacturing Factory," the "Toyo Steel Andong Factory," the "Andong Cement Factory," the "Manchuria Industrial Factory," the "Manchuria Light Metal Factory," the "Manchuria Mining and Refining Plant," the "Yalu River Lumber (Shipbuilding) Joint Stock Company," the "Yalu River Paper Company," the "Andong Paper Factory," the "Liuhecheng Paper Factory," and the "Manchuria Textile Company Factory," among others. In addition, there were also large and small factories producing rubber, matches, and paper, thus creating the phenomenon of Andong's industrial development.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, only a few remain now. Some have even been burned and bombed by the Communist Army. Last evening, the reporter visited the huge substation that had been reduced to rubble, and also saw the Yalu River Paper Mill, which was in the same condition as the substation. Everyone felt very heartbroken. The common people said: "At first, the Soviet army moved some of the machinery from the major factories. Today, the Communist Army, in addition to moving some away, thoroughly destroyed the rest." When visiting the "Mudanjiang Shipyard," we were fortunate not to see the tragic scene of fire. Several unfinished large wooden boats and piles of lumber were quietly there. A person who claimed to be "the person in charge of the company" said: During the puppet Manchukuo period, 300 large wooden boats could be built each year. After the restoration, there were 92 unfinished small wooden boats on the shore and 42 in the river. After being used and towed away by the Communist Army over the course of a year, there are now fewer than 20 left.</p>
<p>Once Turned Into a Dark Hell</p>
<p>From the front of the destroyed "Anfeng Railway Bureau," we walked to the Yalu River Bridge. The two large iron bridges spanning the Yalu River stood tall and serenely over the river. The one on the right was completed in 1911, during the Meiji era in Japan. The one on the left was marked with the year 2601 of the imperial era. Each bridge was crisscrossed with barbed wire, woven in the same pattern below. Two sentries were watching the other side of the bridge. Barbed wire was also set up on that side, and Soviet soldiers were stationed there. Traffic was cut off, but a friendly attitude was maintained between the two sides.</p>
<p>Andong City no longer had the Communist Army. Several substations had been thoroughly destroyed, and the Soviet side was not supplying electricity. As a result, Andong City became a dark world. At the same time, there was no tap water to drink, and people had to drink bitter well water. Because of this serious problem, the local maintenance association once sent people to negotiate with the Soviet side. The negotiation location was the center point of the iron bridge. Neither side took an extra step. There were a total of two pairs of people, one interpreter and one negotiator. Three negotiations failed to produce any results. In addition, there was also a note from me, who was also the garrison commander, Zhao Gongwu, stating: When the National Army first arrived in Andong, Soviet aircraft from Sinuiju flew over the Yalu River and soared over Andong City. The note stated: "If an accident occurs, our side will not be responsible." The Soviet aircraft have not crossed the river since then.</p>
<p>The Sinuiju power plant is jointly owned by the puppet Manchukuo and Korean administrations, because the puppet Manchukuo also invested in it. However, Sinuiju has a large surplus of electricity, and the people of Andong are suffering from a lack of electricity. At the same time, the high-voltage line from Andong to Dalian is intact. The switch for transmitting power from Sinuiju to Dalian is located at our bridgehead. In addition to hoping for friendly cooperation with the Soviet Union, we are also carefully protecting the bridgehead switch and the power plants and dams on our ground.</p>
<p>We stood on the bridgehead, looking across the river. Black smoke billowed from the factories, and steam rose. Trains came and went incessantly, and the riverbank was filled with ships of all sizes, some traveling upstream and downstream. Everything showed a tense and energetic atmosphere. On our side, the factories were crippled, the riverbank was silent, and the remaining three locomotives were shouldering a difficult responsibility, traveling back and forth between Andong and Caohekou. Everything is waiting for restoration and rebirth!</p>
<p>The People's Enthusiasm is Overflowing</p>
<p>Since the construction of the Dadong Port during the puppet Manchukuo period, Andong City has expanded its urban planning. The city limits extend from Dongdingzi in the north to Dadongman in the south, a north-south distance of about forty li. The rectangular urban area relies on the Yalu River, covering an area of about 297 square li. The population is estimated at 330,000, according to the statistics of the puppet Manchukuo in 1942. This includes 54,000 Japanese and Korean people. At that time, it was planned to create a city with a population of 400,000 within five years. Now, Japanese people are rarely seen, and the number of Koreans who have remained is not large.</p>
<p>The people of Andong have the typical characteristics of Shandong people, both in character and accent, and are mostly forthright and enthusiastic. Although they still hold many "Liaodong Military Region" Communist Army banknotes earned with blood and sweat, they still welcome the National Army, whom they see as "divine soldiers descending from heaven." This enthusiasm should be cherished and maintained!</p>
<p>Prices are lower than in Shenyang, but because much of the material has been taken away by the Communist Army, and because there are more people coming from outside, there is a trend of gradual price increases. Currently, only pork has increased from 50 yuan per jin in puppet Manchukuo currency to 80 yuan. Other price increases are similar. The circulating currency has been transported to Andong, and merchants from Shenyang have also come, which is also a factor in rising prices.</p>
<p>Almost all merchants have opened their doors for business, but goods are very scarce. The famous Andong silk fabrics have also disappeared. Inexpensive fish, shrimp, and seafood are also in short supply in the market. The reason is that people fishing on the riverbank or seashore are often shot at from the Korean side. Now, the road connecting traffic with Korea is also cut off, so where will the fish, shrimp, and seafood come from!</p>
<p>There are 36 elementary schools in Andong City, and all have started classes. The three temporary schools, Provincial Junior High, Senior High, and Girls' High, have more than 1,200 students and have also started classes. However, there is a lack of educational funding, and there are many other difficulties. Textbooks alone have become a problem. Although the provincial government took the great risk of "linking the seven provinces" by printing 10,000 copies of elementary school textbooks, this has not yet solved this serious problem.</p>
<p>Zhenwang Mountain, praised by the Japanese puppets as the "Number One of Manchuria's Eight Scenic Spots," although it no longer has cherry blossoms, its scenery remains. However, the Shinto shrine buildings, which cost a lot of money, are now bleak. Many defensive fortifications have been built on Yuabao Mountain, a key point in the city. The areas outside the city are also stable, and the people are accepting and supporting the government's construction with enthusiasm!</p>

<h3 id="e179">Ghosts in the "Liberated Zone" – Excerpts from "I Know Everything and Say Everything" <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>— Zhu Yaotian</p>
<p>Ghosts Come to the Door Wanting Money – If the Ghosts Don't Leave, Something Will Go Wrong</p>
<p>Let me tell you a story about fundraising for "serving the people." Your ward chief, who later also became the village chief, often came to the place I frequented on patrol, so I knew clearly that he could only say two sentences: "The Communist Party is the best" and "No one else is good." Besides that, he knew nothing and was capable of nothing. I'm digressing a bit. Let me tell you the fundraising story. One day, I was chatting in the home of one of your people, and this ward chief brother of yours came. Your people generously took out your banknotes, 150 yuan, and presented them with both hands, saying, "…This 100 yuan is my donation, and this 50 yuan is for Zhang's family." At this time, the ward chief's beady eyes were staring at me, as if saying, "Why are you giving me the money in front of a stranger?" But finally, he put it in his pocket and left. After the ward chief left, I learned the details of this fundraising from your people. The fact is:</p>
<p>Your ward chief said the day before that a poor old person had died and had no money to buy a coffin. The ward chief had bought one on credit from the coffin shop, and now the body had been carried out. The debt to the coffin shop had to be paid by everyone donating some money. "Is there a donation register, a receipt, or an invoice from the coffin shop?" I asked. Your people said, "There's nothing." "Then why do you have to donate money to him?" I asked. Your people said, "If ghosts come to the door and you don't spend money to buy some paper to burn, the ghosts won't leave, and something will go wrong." We ended our conversation with a bitter smile. I think this fundraising story is neither "the Communist Party serving the people" nor "the people serving the Communist Party," but rather "the people and the Communist Party both serving real scoundrels." I wonder if Mr. Mao agrees with my statement?</p>
<h3 id="e180">A Chorus of Anti-Soviet Voices <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>— Special Dispatch from Our Reporter Zhu Zun, October 25th</p>
<p>On October 22nd and 23rd, the British House of Commons discussed British foreign policy. On the first day, Foreign Secretary Bevin gave a report; on the second day, Prime Minister Attlee, opposition leader Churchill, and Minister of State McNeil delivered successive speeches. The atmosphere in the House of Commons chamber was tense and noisy. From my seat in the gallery, all I could hear was a chorus of anti-Soviet voices.</p>
<p>Bevin's report was unremarkable, simply outlining British foreign policy. However, Churchill's questioning caused a stir: "Currently, the Soviet Union and its Eastern European allies have 200 divisions of Soviet troops, all organized for wartime. Is the Labour government aware of this?" He continued, "Before 1939, Hitler wrote 'Mein Kampf,' which made it easier to predict Nazi Germany's actions. But what are the Kremlin's current intentions and ambitions? It's a complete mystery!" Although some members of Parliament accused Churchill of being alarmist, and the London Times criticized him for making such startling claims in the current tense international situation, no one denied the gravity of the issue. British public opinion was united in the view that the era of "appeasing Stalin" should come to an end. Prime Minister Attlee, at a British Trades Union Congress gathering on October 24th, vehemently denounced the Soviet Union's policy of keeping its people ignorant and harshly criticized the Communist Party for its reckless behavior. Churchill followed up by referring to the Communist Party as vermin. This unanimous anti-Soviet sentiment in British government and society is unprecedented. After World War I, the British government spared no effort in attacking the newly established Soviet government, but that was merely a difference in ideology and ideals. The current attacks, however, stem from facts and the evolving international political situation, and may sow the seeds of a third world war!</p>
<p>Supporters of Churchill and some Conservative newspapers seized on the issue, drawing parallels between the current Churchill and the Churchill of the Munich era. They argued that Churchill's current startling pronouncements were similar to his warnings before World War II. Back then, he was also accused of being an alarmist, but his words were based on facts, and subsequent international developments confirmed his foresight step by step. The current darkness in the international situation is no less than that of the Munich era. Churchill has once again issued his warning, and although his voice may seem lonely for now, its truth will gradually be recognized by discerning individuals. This kind of argument is simply trying to re-heroize Churchill. Churchill himself does not believe his voice is lonely. He stated in the House of Commons: "A year ago, I gave a speech in Fulton, Missouri, advocating an Anglo-American alliance to defend against aggression. That caused a global uproar, and some British parliamentarians even rudely accused me of stirring up trouble. If that statement were made today, no one would be surprised."</p>
<p>Widespread dissatisfaction with the Soviet Union and the communist parties under its sway is evident everywhere in the British government and society. Churchill's explanation of the term "reactionary" was particularly humorous: "The Communist Party attacks us with weapons, we resist, and therefore we are considered 'reactionaries'!" Prime Minister Attlee also said, "If you are not a communist, you are a fascist." One member of Parliament, when mentioning Poland, made a very witty remark: "Every time Stalin sneezes, the Polish government suffers a major illness!" When McNeil mentioned that both the British, American, and Soviet governments desired peace, one member of Parliament retorted loudly: "Hitler also desired peace!"</p>
<p>British foreign policy is often seen as being in the wake of the U.S. State Department. This may be an exaggeration, but there is some truth to it. Given the Soviet Union's growing ambitions, it is to be expected that Britain and the United States would move in lockstep. Therefore, while it is true to say that the British Foreign Office is in the wake of the U.S. State Department, it is also true to say that Byrnes is Bevin's comrade. The conflicts between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union at post-war international conferences are similar, especially from a military point of view. If the Soviet Union is the target, there is no difference in the steps taken by Britain and the United States, nor can there be any difference. Unfortunately, the confrontation between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union is entirely a power grab. Both sides have great demands, and neither side has achieved its goals. Because the Soviet army is in Eastern and Central Europe, the Soviet Union refuses to compromise on any issues related to the Red Army's location. In North Africa, Italy, Greece, and other Mediterranean regions, the British and American armies are stationed, and Britain and the United States refuse to compromise on any issues related to these areas. As a result, this dispute is becoming increasingly deadlocked.</p>
<p>Vernon Bartlett, a renowned political commentator and member of Parliament who is about to visit China, once wrote to Foreign Secretary Bevin, warning him that Britain's current friends are all right-wingers and reactionaries in various countries, using the nationalism of various countries to resist the Soviet Union's international policies. He advised Bevin to abandon this approach and not to lose the support of moderate left-wingers. He believes that Bevin's foreign policy, whether in Greece, Spain, or China, is one of "defense," so the so-called "masses" are inclined towards Moscow. Although Bartlett is non-partisan, his views may represent the general Labour Party members who oppose Bevin's foreign policy, but whether they can reach the ears of the Labour government's leaders is another matter. Although the British Labour Party claims to be socialist, it is difficult for its foreign policy to abandon its deep-rooted imperialist tendencies for the time being. Therefore, a cartoonist drew a satirical cartoon of Bevin. The cartoon is divided into two parts. The first part shows a group of British diplomats lined up, with former Conservative Foreign Secretary Eden standing beside them. The second part shows the same group of British diplomats, with Labour Foreign Secretary Bevin standing beside them. Moreover, Eden and Bevin are in the same pose, both giving instructions, both with their right hands in their suit pockets.</p>
<p>Given the British diplomatic style, especially during these days of heightened anti-Soviet sentiment, British communists and extreme leftists are undoubtedly in unspeakable pain. However, their power on the British political stage is limited. There are only 45,000 communist party members in the whole of Britain, and they only hold two seats in the House of Commons. Their mouthpiece, the "Daily Worker," recently slammed the flirtation between the Conservative and Labour governments, harshly criticizing Churchill and Bevin for embracing and exchanging kisses with Eden and Attlee. But this faint voice is unlikely to have any effect, and is merely an outlet for their own frustrations!</p>

<h3 id="e181">"Nightingale Flies in the World" - On Screenplay <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>— Guan Yu</p>
<p>The screenplay for "Nightingale Flies in the World" depicts a singer who wishes to sing for the masses. This is a very bright and good theme. However, its plot has too little connection to this theme. Because the fact that the protagonist wants to sing for the masses is not deeply integrated into the plot. Her words and actions cannot be integrated as a whole. Language that is not put into practice, we call it a slogan. Here, the theme of "singing for the masses" becomes a slogan. But I do not deny some of its sporadic expressions, such as: issuing a 500,000 check to allow them to establish a music group, opposing price increases, etc. These do not completely fit the theme. Although she joined Ren Yun's band and provided free comfort to civilians, what connection did the lyrics of the songs she sang to comfort civilians have to civilians? The purpose of singing for the masses should not be just to let civilians listen to the songs, but to give civilians some inspiration and strength in life in the songs, which would be more in line with this theme. If it is only for the purpose of letting civilians listen to the songs, I think it is very possible to let the ticket prices in the theater increase, and then offer some complimentary tickets in the theater and distribute them to civilians. Wouldn't this kill two birds with one stone? Why must the theater and the civilians be separated? If the things sung in the theater are absolutely two different kinds of songs than what civilians can hear, then it must be separated.</p>
<p>In the play, Ruth committed suicide. Liu Ying and Ren went to wander around, truly singing for the masses. But we also see song and dance scenes on the stage. Are these also performed for free for civilians? If it is really performed for civilians, we have not seen a single civilian.</p>
<p>What else can we see in this screenplay besides singing and dancing scenes? Which line in this screenplay represents the character of the characters? Which plot in this screenplay is inevitable? No, everything is accidental, opportunistic.</p>
<p>Although the theme of this screenplay is expressed by a theme song, if we only look at the lyrics, which section can fit the plot or the characters? No, there is not even a shadow. All that is present are fragmentary shots taken by the director and moved in front of the audience in coordination with the lyrics.</p>
<p>If this screenplay was not saved by the director's flexible lens, it would become an empty thing. If the director's handling of the song and dance scenes is not beautiful and spectacular, then it will be a film that is not worth watching. Fortunately, the director's technique made us feel that it was not bad and worth watching after watching the film!</p>
<h3 id="e182">On Directing <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>— Ju Lei</p>
<p>The second domestic film "Nightingale Flies in the World" has been released at the "Empress" theater. Generally speaking, it is commendable that Mr. Fang Peilin was able to use more than a month of work to shoot this complex song and dance film. The protagonist, Ouyang Fei Ying, is also appearing on the screen for the first time, and everything must be painstakingly planned and save time and money. Using the current situation of the Chinese film industry as an estimate, we should not make harsh demands, because Mr. Fang has used his bold talent and done his best.</p>
<p>I want to harshly review it, anyway, this is just my personal opinion, and it will definitely not detract from the crowded situation of tens of thousands of people in front of the Empress these days.</p>
<p>From the director's point of view, Mr. Fang started his career with clever set design, and the flexible use of lenses laid the foundation for his directing. In this film, the use of set design is his forte. The sets in "Shangri-La," the theater, and Liu Ying's home can be said to be perfect. It is a pity that Mr. Fang's energy is devoted to this, and he lightly neglects the "emotion" and "atmosphere" of the whole play. For example, in the opening scene where Liu Ying and the musician meet, it is said that she is disturbed by the blind pursuit of wealthy businessmen and the competition of reporters, and she is busy all day long. The audience will only applaud and shout good at the red singer standing on the magnificent stage. No one will hear her tired sigh when she takes off her makeup and stands in front of the dressing mirror. To cherish her fleeting years, to cherish her beauty, she gives her love to the audience on the stage, and after suffering all kinds of ridicule and flattery, she will still feel exhausted and lonely. Therefore, she has reveries about the soft and quiet night outside the window. Where can she find this source of life to nourish her withered soul? Just like Joan MacDonald in "Maytime," after accepting the marriage proposal of her guardian, John Barrymore, she immediately became confused and distressed. She avoided the warm applause in front of the stage, and in the quiet alley, she told her coachman to drive the horse's bridle and drive randomly towards the star-lit and gem-like sky. On the way, she met Paul in a low-grade hotel. Passionate, bold, handsome, and unrestrained—she had never missed this chance encounter in thousands of years, and she had been waiting for this moment wholeheartedly in thousands of years. The little boat of her dreams was parked in front of her, ready to carry her to the more vast and wider human sea. The love between the two people was not accidental, but had been waiting for a long time. Therefore, that night, Miss Liu Ying drove home, met Chen Tianguo in the rain, and was full of love and pity. But Mr. Fang did not deliberately deal with the crowd surrounding Liu Ying when she took off her makeup, so as to set off the scene of her exhaustion. Liu Ying avoided her pursuers and went home happily. There was no accumulation of fatigue in front, and there was a lack of passionate overflow behind. Therefore, it feels unnatural for the two to fall in love at first sight.</p>
<h3 id="e183">On Ouyang Fei Ying <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>— Lao Bo</p>
<p>An actor who is on the screen for the first time is excited and scared. Because she always feels that she is acting. But Ouyang Fei Ying's play is unexpected. She is not as "stage-shy" as the actors who are on the screen for the first time. The director also fully increases the singing scene to reduce her chances of acting. The tone of her voice is similar to Mizzo-Soprano. The theme songs "Oath" and "Rainy" are not bad. She is a singer, and she sings really well, and it is pleasant enough. However, her acting skills cannot be considered successful. But she is a person who can be made, as long as she can humbly learn.</p>
<p>I hope that Ouyang Fei Jing can practice Mandarin more, watch the performances of foreign stars more, so that she can understand the starting point and methods of their acting skills, and even the degree of their acting skills, that is: how to be just right, how to overdo it, and how to be insufficient. Such an understanding is equivalent to having a foundation. This is a condition that an actor should have, and the purpose of learning.</p>
<p>More importantly, she can withstand criticism. Don't laugh when people say good things about you. Don't jump when people say bad things about you. Treat any kind of criticism as a reference, or use them as a mirror of your success and failure. However, the most important thing is to work hard and make preparations for the next level. Otherwise, there will only be failure!</p>
<h3 id="e184">On Yan Su <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>— Jiang Wu</p>
<p>Yan Su has already met us once in "Loyalty and Righteousness Home". This time in "Nightingale Flies in the World" is his second appearance. Obviously, he is more successful than in the previous drama. In "Nightingale Flies in the World," he plays a stubborn and prejudiced old musician. He uses "stiffness" to express his stubbornness and self-righteous nobility, completing part of the character. His acting skills are very good, especially when he is in the hospital bed, driving Liu Ying away with a roar that is higher and more powerful than the other, forcing the other party to succumb to his three "get out". When he conducts, the smile on his face shows his pride and his success in training Liu Ying, and also shows his self-confidence.</p>
<p>He is an accomplished actor, so he can play his acting skills leisurely and naturally in front of the camera and under the mercury lamp. In the whole play, his acting skills are the most successful!</p>
<p>He is from Beijing and speaks fluent and melodious Mandarin, which has the power to make people intoxicated. But his appearance limits his acting, making him only able to circle in the negative roles, which is a pity!</p>
<h3 id="e185">Right picture: Yan Su <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>

<p>— Zhu Defeng</p>
<p>"Nightingale Flies in the World" finally followed "Loyalty and Righteousness Home" and was released. In the face of a constant stream of American films, the production of a domestic film is naturally welcomed by the audience, especially in this difficult and prolonged process.</p>
<p>Song and dance films have always been rare in domestic films. Everyone knows that the shortage of talent and the lack of material conditions are the fatal wounds of my country's film industry. However, we cannot stop doing it because we lack the above conditions. Although it cannot be compared with Hollywood films, it can at least gradually progress, promote some educational significance and make some achievements.</p>
<p>"Nightingale Flies in the World" is the first song and dance film after the victory. The director, Fang Peilin, can be said to be an experienced expert in directing song and dance films in domestic films. After watching the whole film, I feel that several song and dance scenes are very good.</p>
<p>Ouyang Fei Ying plays Liu Ying. Although her voice is clear and bright, she sings well. However, some of her expressions are not profound enough. This is her first film on the screen, and generally speaking, it is not easy. Guan Hongda is very vivid, and his acting skills and expressions are very appropriate and quite natural. Yan Su's Ruth is also not bad. Although this film cannot be compared with Hollywood's colorful song and dance films, domestic films have their own characteristics, and of course their style is different from Western films. It has a different taste.</p>
<h3 id="e187">Weekly Movie Short Reviews <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>— Zhu Xi</p>
<p>Mad Love</p>
<p>The theme is similar to "Jealousy in the Sea of Love", but the male protagonist's jealousy is changed to the female protagonist's. In the end, they all destroy themselves and cause harm to others, and the trial in court ends the injustice.</p>
<p>From its structure, "Mad Love" is better than "Jealousy in the Sea of Love", because the latter lacks too many strong components, and the threshold for teaching the audience to harm people is too refined. The former is better in these two points.</p>
<p>The screenwriter of "Mad Love" pays too much attention to dialogue and ignores the drama. Although some of the dialogues are very delicate and vivid, for example: the flirting couple Chang Kang Nawei Erde just finished typing "I want to marry you" on the typewriter. But its dull and boring scenes can be found everywhere, which is the screenwriter's negligence. Fortunately, the director took care of this point for him, and tried to use the activity on the lens as much as possible to make it "have drama" when there is no drama. When Kang Na came out of the living room door to work by the typewriter, the director deliberately let him walk out of the room, passing a swimming pool, turning a corner, quietly, of course, the scenery and colors are very beautiful, and it is matched with harmonious music; then he sat down to type. For the sake of "drama", Jenny Ge, who is about to have a lot of "dialogue with little drama", is specially placed on the flower shed, and Qi En Tai Ni is placed under the pool, so that the scene is not too dull.</p>
<p>The overall director's drama is not very good, but his efforts can be seen all the time. Qi En Tai Ni's first scene is too theatrical, but the latter part is very good. Kang Na Wei Erde is competent, and Jenny Ge is mediocre.</p>
<p>Between Men and Women</p>
<p>The story depicts the emotions of mutual consideration between mother and daughter and the depth of each other's intentions, but due to social habits, it does not match our country's situation. But the play is a good discussion.</p>
<p>If you say that this movie's director is not bad, it is better to say that the screenwriter's foundation is good; it is better to say that the success of the screenwriter is due to Dai Na Ba Li Mo Ya's prominence.</p>
<p>Dai Na Ba Li Mo Ya is the daughter of the late superstar John Barrymore, an American "artistic family" - they have been good at performing Shakespeare's famous plays for generations. The producer of this play used her ability to perform many aspects of the play, and picked a play with a stage actor as the protagonist for her to perform, which may be said to be specially written for her. In this way, the producer is quite smart.</p>
<p>Sure enough, Dai Na's performance is not bad, especially it is rare to play a twelve or thirteen-year-old girl. Although this kind of play is easy to please, it is also a fact that it is difficult to perform.</p>
<p>The old nanny's last return is superfluous. The screenwriter's intention is reunion, but this cannot avoid being "vulgar."</p>
<p>The opening and ending are both on the stage, and they are both used very well.</p>
<p>The whole play is about watching Dai Na alone. She alone can give you two hours of satisfaction.</p>
<p>Queen of the Nile</p>
<p>Mary Montan and John Hall are always the same -</p>
<p>However, the scenery and colors of this film are not bad. The several scenes of riding horses are also handled well. The several shots of rolling rocks are not too careless. Compared to "Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves" and "Arabian Nights", it is a notch better.</p>
<p>As for the actors, they are all their old partners. Mary Montan has played a lot of this kind of film. Before watching it, you can almost make a certain conclusion. But in a word, Mary Montan sells "beauty" and not "drama". If there is an actor whose acting skills can surpass Mary Montan, he will never be willing to act with her. In this way, you can know more about the actors in the film.</p>
<h3 id="e188">Miscellaneous Comments on New Films <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>— Ma Boliang</p>
<p>Torrid Zone</p>
<p>Beautiful mountains, beautiful rivers, lakes, sunshine, moonlight, beaches, houses, what a beautiful world. If there is no love, all beauty is but desolation. I have always felt that a person's life is always their own world. They can never occupy another person's world, especially not share another person's eternal emotions. The heroine here is unwilling to endure the loneliness of her personal world, and suddenly harbors murderous intent, killing others while also killing herself. The theme of "Torrid Zone" can be said to be a gender reversal of the protagonist in "Jealousy of Love," with the motivation being the same. Although the heroine of "Torrid Zone" is more vicious and hateful than the hero of "Jealousy of Love," the despicable man is the one who is truly reprehensible. This heroine is certainly selfish, but she is more worthy of sympathy. She is a pitiful tragic figure. Sometimes we can quietly think about it, whose love life can insert the shadow of a third party?</p>
<p>Director Stahl is not an outstanding talent; the messiness of "Golden Earrings" is clear evidence of this. The achievements of this film are relatively good. It has captured many previously unseen landscapes, matched with pleasing colors, combined into a splendid backdrop. The scene of drowning the little uncle while wearing sunglasses has a dual subtle effect, incredibly clever. The pair of hands reaching out for help on the water surface and a few bubbles are the most vivid and powerful, unforgettable. The dubbing, with a few chimes from the mountains, has the lingering effect of three days around the beams. Other aspects are not explicit enough. The leading actress, Joan Tetzel, acts far more brilliantly than in "Modern Paradise." Some women are not necessarily beautiful, but they know how to make themselves look beautiful. Joan is the best example. Her train encounter and bedroom kiss request are more than seductive. Her clothing is very gorgeous, coupled with her unique sex appeal, fully sufficient to maintain her success. The leading actor, Richard Widmark, is not as profound as Gregory Peck, the quickly rising male lead in "Days of Glory."</p>
<p>Between Two Women</p>
<p>Is a string of farcical laughter. Cary Grant is still in his true colors from "The Awful Truth" and "Every Girl Should Be Married," treating love as a childish game, letting a daughter who works as an actress make a scene for her mother, causing chaos everywhere. The play begins on the stage and ends on the stage. Henry Koster's directing technique is fluent and smooth, constantly adding layers of humor, sometimes too exaggerated, like driving a car recklessly while ice skating, and throwing a woman into the river in a few scenes. It seems too degrading to women, noisy and lively, slightly crude, but otherwise brings gentle happiness. The leading actress, Diana Barrymore, gives a stunning performance, handling it with ease. She is truly favored by the muse. When not making a fuss, she opens her almond-shaped eyes and smiles sweetly, as lovely as June Duprez, and her demeanor is more elegant than Deanna Durbin, whom Koster personally promoted in the past. I think one day she may surpass Claudette Colbert. Her youth, health, and liveliness will make her an excellent comedy actress. Now she alone brings "Between Two Women" to life. Katharine Alexander can only play the mother. As the beauty fades, what can be said? Robert Cummings is just adequate.</p>
<p>Stone Flower</p>
<p>Scene after scene of dreamy paintings, dreamy colors, we are fundamentally following a path in dreams. The gathering of savages on the mountain plains, the flute playing in the forest, the little lovers' sad first kiss, the shadows and fallen leaves of girls by the stream, the buds of flowers, late-night conversations, the illusion of goddesses... Unable to understand the crude language of the Russian prairie people, the meaning of dreams sweeps across the eyes like layer after layer of colorful clouds. The clarity of the photography and coloring surpasses the paintings. It is the crystallization of music and art. Hollywood lacks this clear temperament. "Torrid Zone" has another kind of radiant scene, but it is definitely not the hazy nature of "Stone Flower." Americans have never imagined the green forests and cold rocks. The director's technique is slightly complicated, with dissolve in and dissolve out shots used uniformly. The dubbing failed to be fully utilized. Sometimes it is silent, not helping the emotions, but that one burst of pastoral flute is better than any other ten thousand sounds.</p>

<h3 id="e190">Moon Over the Qinhuai River <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>— He Tianjian</p>
<p>The moon over the Qinhuai River is no different from that in other places. It is not that the Qinhuai River is the only place with a moon, nor is it that the moon over the Qinhuai River has any particular sentiment. The moon is everywhere, and the Qinhuai River is just the Qinhuai River. However, to say where in the world the moon is most abundant, I feel it is most abundant over the Qinhuai River. Thus, the moon on the waters of the Qinhuai River becomes the central theme of this article.</p>
<p>I have not seen the Qinhuai River for ten years! If I were to visit the Qinhuai River during these ten years, I would be unable to bear hearing "Still singing 'Flowers of the Rear Courtyard' across the river." Therefore, I have decided not to go. But "The moon of old, east of the Huai River" is always lingering in my heart! Today, the enemy is defeated, the country is restored, and I must go! If I go, the moon will still shine on me over the Qinhuai River. – The moon over the Qinhuai River is no different, but the north bank of the Qinhuai River has become a marketplace. Singing sounds are noisy and fill the sky, the sounds of hawking mix on the streets. The Kuiguang Pavilion is no longer visible, and only the front building of the Qifang Pavilion remains. Wine shops and teahouses are covered in phlegm, and the Wende Bridge and Lishe Bridge have a piercing stench. The day boats are dilapidated, moored on the eastern side. The Qinhuai River is never clear and remains as filthy as ever. I got drunk at the head of the Wende Bridge, and a round cool moon gradually rose in the middle of the sky. I was slightly drunk, and saw no acquaintances around me. I only felt that the moon had a questioning intent, a sense of sadness! As if asking me, how could we meet here on this day, in this place? Your head is half white, how could you be here at this time, looking at me? Life is fleeting, how long has it been, and the head of youth has turned white! I cannot help but recall the Qinhuai moon ten years ago.</p>
<p>Ten years ago, in the spring of the 25th year, the spring moon, its color was bright. The autumn moon, its color was clear. This moon now is different from the moon then – at that time, my head was not white. I held a "solo exhibition" by the side of Zhonghua Road, and Teng Ruoqu wrote an article to promote it for me. – Now Teng is already dead! – One evening, Teng and I hired a singing boat on the Qinhuai River. Teng took out his composition in classical Chinese for discussion, asking me, is this classical Chinese? I said, those who study classical Chinese write new essays and think they are extremely new, but those who study new essays still find them old. It is the same for those who study new essays and write classical Chinese. Teng nodded. I further said: How can there be new or old essays, it is merely a matter of habit. The wine was already plentiful. A maiden of thirteen or fifteen plucked the pipa, playing the curved moon, bay after bay. The boat was already moved near the east city, and in the distance, Zhongshan Mountain stretched across the horizon, a stroke of ink in the sky. At that time, I did not know what fame or fortune was. And the moon was increasingly bright, watching the eyes of the singers, extremely charming. I cannot help but think of Little Jin Hong of the Qinhuai moon night ten years ago.</p>
<p>Twenty-one years ago, which was the 14th year. At that time, it was early summer. I held a teaching post south of the Qinhuai River. The painting boats of the Qinhuai River were densely packed like combs. On both banks, there were still river houses and waterside pavilions. The setting sun was on the mountain, and under the bright lights and painted curtains, there were those leaning on Xiao, and those laughing and talking. One evening, the moon was like water. I and a friend hired a painting boat, planning a drunken drinking session. There was a young and beautiful girl named Little Jin Hong, singing tunes like an oriole. I privately inquired about her, and learned that she was from a good family, who was tricked into prostitution, and I pitied her. Her ransom was very low, easily raised. A few days later, Mr. Huang Boqiu gave money to purchase my paintings through Mr. Sun Naizhan from the same hometown, obtaining fifteen yuan. This was insufficient, so I painted a picture of listening to songs for a fellow townsman in Beijing, obtaining forty yuan, and immediately bought Little Jin Hong's freedom, and pawned a fur coat to make travel expenses, sending her home. – Little Jin Hong indeed had a maternal uncle in Beijing, who was a stingy and unbearable person, hoping for his assistance but he would not help. Only at this point did he acknowledge her as his niece, which was also due to my intervention. From then on, I was on the Qinhuai River every night, and on evenings with moonlight, my interest grew stronger. But at this time, looking at the moon, I often had the bewilderment of "Thirty years like flowing water!" Truly, there was none of the mood of being in my twenties!</p>
<p>When I was twenty-one years old, I was studying at the Republic Prison School at Huaiqing Bridge, close to the Qinhuai River. I listened to songs and drank every night. Whenever I was drunk and flushed, I would often discuss national affairs with enthusiasm with Mr. Dong Hangtian from Anhui Province, taking the responsibility of clearing up the world as "Who else but me!" Putting a boat east of Banqiao, with willows on both banks; the bright moon shifted westwards, still lingering within, unable to bear to return.</p>
<p>Alas! The Qinhuai moon of today is still the Qinhuai moon of old, but people are already gradually old! What responsibilities, what affairs, are already unbearable to speak of to me today. I love painting, I love poetry, but I am not good at business matters. How to advertise, how to play tricks, I am truly unwilling to do. Although the water of the Qinhuai River is turbid, the moon of the Qinhuai River is still pure. I am on the Qinhuai River, my heart is like the moon. With a cup in hand, I call on the moon to drink together. O moon, will you regard me as a confidant!</p>
<h3 id="e191">Chrysanthemum Art <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>— Chuntai</p>
<p>General Discussion on Painting</p>
<p>Chrysanthemums are spherical or a part of a sphere, so they are planar or three-dimensional radial. The painter who grasps this point will get their general form.</p>
<p>Chrysanthemums vary in thousands of ways, but analyzing them, they do not exceed the following types:</p>
<p>1. Petal Chrysanthemums: The flower head of a petal chrysanthemum has petals as its basic state. The lower end is tubular, but very short, not easily seen.</p>
<p>2. Tubular Chrysanthemums: The tubular shape of the petals extends, not showing the petal shape, but showing the color in the tube. Generally, the color inside the tube is darker than outside.</p>
<p>3. Lip Chrysanthemums: The ends of long tubes open into petals, and their color is often different from the color of the tube. Some tubes are long and lips short, some tubes are short and lips long.</p>
<p>4. Needle Chrysanthemums: The mouth of the tube is closed and slender, forming a needle shape. It is difficult to create such a needle ball entirely. Used in combination with thick flower heads, it has a special charm.</p>
<p>5. Silken Chrysanthemums: Single petals that are thin and long are called silk. These are rare and precious, being old Chinese varieties.</p>
<p>6. Curled Chrysanthemums: Petals that curl inwards are called "Ten Thousand Books," which are very beautiful. In the lower right corner of the drawing, "Buddha's Curly Hair," the tube color is yellow, and the inside of the lip is red.</p>
<p>7. Hairy Chrysanthemums: To create a striking effect, hairs grow on the petals, called hairy chrysanthemums, also known as prickly chrysanthemums. They come in red, yellow, purple, and other colors.</p>
<p>8. Dotted and Dyed Chrysanthemums: Even more so are those with dots added to the petals, such as the "Maple Leaf Reed Flowers" variety, which adds white spots to red flowers.</p>
<p>In addition to these eight types, there is another change, which is the evolution of the flower center, called "Supporting Cassia," which is also interesting in painting.</p>
<p>The basic colors of chrysanthemums are white, yellow, and red. Before the flowers bloom, these three major categories can be distinguished by the leaf color. As for the thickness of the petals, it is consistent with the thickness of the leaves. Chrysanthemum leaves are more difficult to paint than chrysanthemum flowers.</p>
<p>The green chrysanthemum is the most valuable, and its nature is also more delicate. Purple and orange colors are variations of the basic three colors. The so-called ink color is only the deepest red and purple. As for the composition of the petals, there are curved shapes, curves, jets, hanging threads, rotations, and various changes, increasing the complexity of the flower shape.</p>
<p>The illustrations shown are all cultivated in Tsinghua Garden, Beiping. More than a hundred species were written out in 1925, and subsequent works were added each year. The chrysanthemums of Tsinghua Garden have long since ceased to exist. I do not know if there are still many good varieties in Beiping.</p>

<p>— Bin Jia</p>
<p>A warrior and a poet are merely two incarnations of the same god. The existence of a god among us is like the existence of reason in our thinking activities. Therefore, let poets and warriors be our highest ideals.</p>
<p>One must first have the character of a poet, and then there will be "poetry."</p>
<h3 id="e194">Shu Tieyun and Zheng Shuwen <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>— Huang Lou</p>
<p>During the Qing dynasty, there were two northerners who resided in Suzhou and were shaped by the Jiangnan culture. The former was Shu Tieyun, who had ten thousand rooms, and the latter was Zheng Shuwen in the Guangxu period. The clear and beautiful scenery of Wu, and the elegant and gentle human relationships, are truly enough to make people linger and be intoxicated, to achieve their metaphysical attainments. Even now, they make people unconsciously yearn for them.</p>
<p>Shu Tieyun married a woman from Wu, and was related to Wang Zhongqu of Xiushui. His wife was also capable in literature. The poems in Tieyun's "Ping Shui Qi Poetry Collection" sent to the person of Nüchuang Mountain are affectionate and poignant, and one can imagine the elegance and depth of his boudoir. When he served in the military in Guizhou, there was a beautiful Miao girl named Long Yaomei. It is said that the commanding officer intended to give her to him as a concubine, but he refused. It was very common at that time for Miao girls in Guizhou to be captured by officers and soldiers to be used as slaves and concubines. The eldest sister described in the "Romance of Heroes and Heroines" was tall, with black skin, very similar to the race of Qianxi. Perhaps she was from the Shui An clan. Although the novelistic technique of "Romance of Heroes and Heroines" is not particularly outstanding, what it depicts is indeed the real social situation, which other novels do not have. After Tieyun passed the imperial examination, he had difficulty advancing, but instead gained some of the pleasures of a wandering scholar, probably influenced by his wife. He could speak the Wu dialect, so he became fond of Kunqu opera. Living near the Chuihong Pavilion, he naturally had the heroic and triumphant spirit of a little red singing softly while I play the Xiao. I once saw his handwritten drafts of Ci and Qu poems, written in small regular script on red squares, the characters were very precise and refined, already with a hint of the style of the Daoguang years. The people of the three Wu regions are all elegant and appreciate themselves, full of sentiment. Famous figures of the time, such as Sun Yuanru, Sun Zixiao, Wang Zhongqu, Cao Wenke, and even Zhang Chuanshan, who later made a living as a recluse, all liked to talk about the pleasures of marriage. This is not often seen elsewhere.</p>
<p>Zheng Shuwen was originally a Han Bannerman. In Suzhou, he worked as a famous staff member, a famous scholar, and a famous doctor. He married a woman from Wu, built a refined residence, and purchased and researched epigraphy, calligraphy, paintings, books, cultural objects, ornamental rocks, porcelain, and cuisine. He excelled in everything, especially in Ci and Qu poetry, calligraphy, and painting, which made him famous at the time. Contemporary officials and gentry all interacted with him, respectfully praising him. His ability to enjoy his talents and also enjoy his blessings is probably unparalleled in recent decades. His style is somewhat like Gu Aying of the late Yuan dynasty, although not as wealthy. His temperament is somewhat like Yuan Suiyuan in the Qianlong period, but his character seems to surpass him. He can also be considered a remarkable person. Generally, Bannermen have seen more of the world, and have always been keen on the enjoyment of life. Moreover, he came from a prominent family, and he resided in a peaceful and beautiful Wu region, and he was rich in knowledge and talent. This kind of achievement is not easy to put together. Elegance is a rare blessing. It requires the right time, the right place, and the right fate, as well as shared cultivation and talent. Moreover, this blessing of elegance is fleeting and not easy to maintain for a long time. Not only are there few such people in a generation, but even in a lifetime, one does not know how many days one has. His death was after the founding of the Republic of China. Peking University once offered him a generous salary of four hundred yuan to teach, but he declined. However, the sense of desolation at Jiangguan in his later years can be imagined.</p>
<p>Presumably, he was accustomed to the old family house structures of Yandu, so his residence, Qi Wangxiangkan, was a secluded and winding studio, small and exquisite. What Geng Zishan called "connecting the enclosed rooms" can be imagined as its compact structure. This type of residence is most suitable for living. In winter, it can avoid wind and keep warm, and in summer, reflecting the lush parasol trees and bamboo in front of the window, the scorching sun does not invade, and the mundane world does not reach it, naturally filling the room with coolness, as if in an ancient cave. It is also convenient for storage. The books, scrolls, stationery, incense, tea, wine utensils, and even the essential medicines, clothes, bedding, fans that are indispensable for living, can be easily taken and carried, easily accessible. Especially for people with broad interests, it is necessary to have several rooms with different facilities. One place for storing books, convenient for writing, with scattered paper and pens, which is fine. For painting by the pond, the windows must be bright and the table clean, with silk, brushes, inkstones, and water jars arranged on the long table, and the walls should be plain and slightly high so that painting axes can be hung. As for leisure and rest, and talking with three or five friends, it is also necessary to have strange rocks and famous flowers, accompanied by tea and incense burners, and musical instruments can be taken at will to play with. All of these layouts must be carefully designed.</p>
<p>In recent years, I saw a small axis with the meaning of "Drawing of Flowers and Shadows of Flute Blowing Under the Curtain, Pale Yellow Moon" painted by him at a friend's place. It depicts a concubine sitting on a Taihu rock step with her back to the viewer, holding a reed. The vermilion railing is winding, and the fine grass covers the feet. A branch of cassia stands tall beside her, set off by several clumps of bamboo. A round window is facing her from a distance, in which incense coils curl. A brocade bag containing a zither hangs on the wall. A faint color on the horizon sets off a moon, giving people a sense of etherealness like Guanghan. The brushwork is not much, but delicacy is still seen in the simplicity, probably written for a certain concubine. This kind of high and simple brushwork is often sought from people who are fortune tellers.</p>

<p>— Lü Baihua</p>
<p>Rowing on the Lake</p>
<p>The rickshaws in Hangzhou are quite cheap. I got off at the city station and was charged 1,000 yuan to go to the provincial government. Later, a friend said that it was because I was a "stranger," and the actual price was 500 yuan. After the drizzle, the road was still muddy. The rickshaw pulled through winding deep alleys, white powder walls, black tile curtains. I seemed to be going to the countryside. While marveling that this famous city would retain such a flavor, what I came into contact with and felt was particularly cordial. Apart from the central streets, Hangzhou was not "superficially westernized."</p>
<p>Zongen and I walked towards the causeway road. There were few cars coming and going. We boldly walked forward. The chaotic state of jeeps was not found here. In front of us, several willow strands fluttered, sparsely shading a narrow and winding water. The road sign was labeled "Huanxi Road," so this was Huansha Creek. Everyone knows that Huansha Creek is the place where Xi Shi washed silk, but the location should belong to Shaoxing County, originally named Ruoye Creek. Perhaps Hangzhou is the capital of Yue, so it is not impossible to commemorate it nearby. However, a bay of water, shallow and silted, made it difficult to find the legacy, and I felt a bit lost. After passing Huansha Road, we arrived at the lakefront. I looked far and wide at the area of ​​West Lake, which seemed boundless, reflecting the Su and Bai dikes. If it really was the ancient beauty Xi Shi, then the north and south peaks, faintly visible in the distance, were her twin buns. Naturally, the illusion was too absurd. This must be blamed on old man Dongpo for singing a poem, "If West Lake is compared to Xizi," but later generations replaced "if" with "simply" in their eyes. I think if West Lake is to be compared to a beauty, it should be compared to an abstract beauty, "That beauty, a person from the West," the poet's nostalgic words for the flourishing governance of the Western Kingdom, such a comparison is more meaningful. It is best to compare West Lake to a mirror, a large mirror hanging in the air, reflecting all the good and evil in the world, or what people generally call a "bright mirror hanging high." According to the Song History, it was not a bright mirror hanging high, but rather "a mirror hanging in an empty hall." There was Chen Lianghan who was the magistrate of Duan'an County, and the people said, "Your heart is like a mirror hanging in an empty hall!" What exactly have we been shaped into after eight years of the forge? Will we be ashamed of West Lake's hanging mirror! In the light of the setting sun, we hired a boat and lightly floated on the lake.</p>
<p>Ten years without seeing the mountain spirit,</p>
<p>And passing over Huansha Creek again;</p>
<p>The lake's color is as bright as Lianghan's mirror,</p>
<p>How near does it reflect people's hearts?</p>
<p>A three-thousand-foot inverted hanging mirror,</p>
<p>All the ancient style is here;</p>
<p>Who is the person from the West to look forward to,</p>
<p>Green mountains like Dai and added eyebrows.</p>

<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>(The somersault with the gun that Tiger Brother used is one of the "barehanded weapon seizure" methods. I used to practice with my teacher. The method to break it is to aim the gun steadily, take two steps back, or jump to the side one or two steps, and you can still cover the enemy with the gun. I think this method, although adopted by Western detectives and combatants, is probably derived from our country's martial arts. Because without a martial arts foundation, no matter how hard you practice, you won't get very good results. Why do a somersault with the gun on your back? First, it surprises the enemy; second, it avoids the opponent firing the gun. No matter how much you lie down and dodge, it is not as magical as somersaulting with the gun on your back, and it can directly take care of the enemy in front. It's just a pity that this guy today is not an expert. He froze for a moment, so Tiger Brother was able to do what he wanted and solve him. If he had learned this trick, and retreated or dodged to the side, I know that Tiger Brother would have had more exciting boxing and kicking to perform. However, before using this somersault with the gun, you must consider three conditions: first, the opposing enemy is within the distance that I can reach; second, you must be alert to the weapon seizure technique, otherwise even if the gun has passed, it is useless and harmful; third, your own energy cannot be completely used on the somersault with the gun, you must take into account the fight after jumping up from the ground. This kind of fight is not limited to seizing the enemy's weapons, it is best to have one or two killing blows. At this time, don't hold back and try to launch the attack as much as possible. This is a game of life and death, it's either you die, or I die, there is no way to be polite.)</p>
<p>Just under Tiger Brother's blow, the tall man fell to the ground like a collapsing mountain, grunting in his throat, wanting to shout but unable to, only holding his hands on the injured area, struggling desperately, his legs kicking and thrashing wildly. Tiger Brother didn't care whether he was dead or alive. He grabbed the guy's collar, dragged him up and ran towards the gasoline area. I was a bit stunned at this time. When Tiger Brother started running, I was awakened and hurriedly picked up my and Tiger Brother's pistols, inserted them into my waist, and grabbed the hand-held machine gun to defend against the enemy catching up, and I could resist for a while. While running around the gasoline barrels, I quietly warned Tiger Brother to follow me quickly. The burning fuse on the ground was burning, not much was left. At the same time, it seemed that I could hear the pack of dogs running towards here.</p>
<p>We crossed the heavy obstacles, crossed the stream, and the gasoline area of the demon cave was already on fire. Before long, the fire grew bigger, and I thought it had burned to the oil barrels. I could also hear the sound of explosions. At this time, Tiger Brother was carrying the hand-held machine gun weighing twenty or thirty pounds, and I had German-style twenty-round pistols on my left and right (one was Tiger Brother's). I was not afraid of three or five people, but because I was afraid of a large team tracking us, we did not dare to take the main road, but walked diagonally up the high and low wastelands and mounds. After walking about five or six li, looking back, the fire was still raging and the smoke was billowing, illuminating half the sky red. The more than two thousand barrels of gasoline could probably be burned to the last drop. After running another one or two li, I suddenly heard a loud "boom," followed by a series of "ping-pong" explosions, truly shaking the mountains.</p>
<p>"Eh!" We stopped at the same time, looked back, and saw only a puff of thick smoke rising into the air, with a layer of yellow fog underneath, followed by a width of about an acre of fire, rushing straight into the sky. The fire flashed past, and the lingering sound of the loud noise was still vibrating in my eardrums, but the place where it burned was extinguished, and everything returned to silence.</p>

<p>World Student Day</p>
<p>Today, Seven Years Ago:</p>
<p>After the German army occupied Czechoslovakia, they carried out massacres against students and professors in Prague and other major cities, resulting in thousands of deaths. Most of the remaining students were detained in concentration camps, and all higher education institutions were shut down. This was a tragic day.</p>
<p>To commemorate this suffering, the World Student Congress designated this day as World Student Day in 1941. This year marks the fourth commemorative conference, which will be held separately in Nanjing and Shanghai.</p>
<p>During this great war, all countries in the world have suffered, especially the youth of this generation, who have been most affected both physically and mentally. Today, as we commemorate the past, we must be vigilant for the future. Students around the world should unite and work together for peace!</p>
<p>A Song to Remember</p>
<p>A musical film telling the story of the musician Chopin, "A Song to Remember," will be showing in this city. I am willing to recommend this film.</p>
<p>Good music can cleanse the soul. In this city, which is almost devoid of music, this sound film is indeed very necessary to fill the void.</p>
<h3 id="e199">Zhou Fohai's Death Sentence Is the Public's Will <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>When the traitor Wang Jingwei stole and occupied Nanjing, the traitors Zhou Fohai and Chen Gongbo were his right-hand men. The traitor Zhou harbored wild ambitions and intended to replace Wang. Therefore, he gathered his ilk and organized a puppet tax police corps to cultivate his power. At the same time, as the puppet Minister of Finance, he controlled financial power, further creating his countless crimes. When he was riding high, abusing his power, other matters can be discussed later. Just take the issue of issuing puppet currency as an example, it is already not enough to kill him. He halved the assets of the people in the Chongqing occupied areas, causing countless families to be ruined. If the traitor Zhou is not killed for this kind of loss, who will be held accountable? It is only because the Chinese people have always valued emotions and neglected right and wrong, and are also prone to forgetfulness. Seeing this generation of traitors, who were once powerful and influential, now succumb to the solemn national law, people cannot help but feel sorry for them and beg for mercy. Thus, they forget all their past sins at once, and instead sympathize with them. They believe the absurd nonsense of the ugly and wicked, saying that they should be forgiven. To be honest, if the traitor Zhou is spared, not only will our anti-Japanese martyrs sigh with regret in the afterlife, but even the likes of the traitor Chen Gongbo, if they have knowledge after death, will see that they were punished differently for the same crime, and I know they will also cry out in vain!</p>
<p>According to the indictment, the traitor Zhou committed ten crimes. Committing even one of them is already unforgivable, let alone committing all of them. Sentencing him to death is in line with both reason and the severity of his crimes. However, there is one more crime committed by the traitor Zhou that has not been listed, namely, his control of special agents and the brutal killing of loyal and righteous people. Today, when people talk about "No. 76," they are full of resentment towards the traitors Ding Mocun, Li Shangqun, Wu Shibin, and others. Little do they know that all these traitors were cultivated, brought together, and trained by the traitor Zhou. For example, in the case of the collective kidnapping of the employees of the Central Trust Bureau’s villa, the traitors Li and Wu, although acting as lackeys, were actually commanded by the traitor Zhou. This is clear evidence of this. How can the death of such a sinister and vicious person be enough to atone for his sins? If he is executed by shooting, it would be a great favor to the traitor Zhou himself!</p>
<p>Furthermore, the traitor Zhou's wife, Yang Shuhui, relied on her evil power to hoard goods, openly sell official positions, and recklessly plunder. After the victory, she was allowed to go unpunished, running around in Shanghai and Hong Kong to rescue her husband. A certain tabloid also reported that she was lending money at high interest rates in Jiangsu. Although the crime does not extend to the family, as stipulated by law, this adulterous woman herself is already riddled with sins and should share the same fate as the traitors Ye Jiqing and She Aizhen, and should not be allowed to escape the net of justice!</p>
<p>In February of this year, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek came to Shanghai and I was fortunate enough to meet him and speak about matters, advocating that the captured traitors should be tried and sentenced as soon as possible. In early April, I received his reply, stating that the matter had been submitted to the relevant authorities for prompt investigation and handling. At that time, seeing that the traitor Zhou was still detained in Chongqing, I planned to send another letter requesting that he be transferred to Nanjing for legal proceedings. Soon after, it was reported that Zhang was already transferred, saying that the traitor Zhou was about to be sent to Nanjing, so I refrained from sending it. Now that he has been sentenced to death, there is a possibility of commuting his sentence, which I really do not understand. To express public outrage, I do not avoid being trivial and write this article. I believe that among the compatriots in the occupied areas, there must be those who agree with me. I hope everyone will advocate together that this generation of major traitors must not be allowed to escape execution! (Que Chou)</p>

<p>— Wen Zongkong</p>
<p>When a bereaved family sets up a memorial tablet for the deceased, those children who are steeped in feudal ideas often like to prefix their father with "Illustrious Deceased Father" and their mother with "Illustrious Deceased Mother," as if to add to the mourning? If the deceased had indeed done great deeds in his lifetime, benefiting the country and making his parents famous, then prefixing the words "Illustrious Deceased Father/Mother" would be truly fitting. However, many deceased people lived ordinary lives with no achievements. If their conduct was clean, they brought neither fortune nor misfortune to others, and the matter simply passes.</p>
<p>Only on the 13th, I saw in an interview with a female reporter from the Heping Daily that when she interviewed Ms. Yang Yi (other newspapers wrote Yang Zhen), the wife of the veteran traitor Liang Hongzhi, at the Chinese Funeral Home on Haig Road, she felt that the situation was very bleak. There was a memorial tablet on the table that read: "Spiritual Tablet of the Illustrious Deceased Father, Lord Liang Zhongyi." Isn't this a joke?</p>
<p>The traitor Liang Hongzhi organized the Reformed Government, and of course, he was also a major traitor who colluded with the enemy and plotted to resist our country. His crimes of harming the country and the people can be said to be outrageous. Now he has been executed by shooting, and the people are happy. His wife even said, "My husband and I had the best relationship. I suffered with him." She engaged in treasonous acts without offering loyal remonstrance, so "suffering with him" was of course self-inflicted. It is truly a waste to be from a family of scholars for generations, and now she still prefixes his memorial tablet with the words "Illustrious Deceased Father." Isn't this shameless! What exactly did he "illustrate"?</p>
<p>As for the traitor Liang calling himself "Zhongyi," it is also laughable. Only now do I realize that the reason he was named "Zhongyi" was to explain that he was willing to engage in treasonous acts. This point is indeed different from "everyone."</p>

<p>Marriage is a landmark event in life, with three meanings:</p>
<p>(1) Transitioning from individual life to collective cooperative life;</p>
<p>(2) Transitioning from an era when others are responsible for me to an era when I am responsible for others;</p>
<p>(3) Ending training and practice (school life) and entering the era of entrepreneurship (social life).</p>
<p>Therefore, life should attach importance to the issue of marriage and should have a great and noble ideal. This ideal should be: "How can we create happiness for future generations!"</p>
<h3 id="e202">Great Shanghai <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— Hu Yan</p>
<p>The plan for the Greater Shanghai Municipality is already under study. East to Pudong, south to Nanhui, west to Longhua, north to Jiangwan Dachang, the planned Greater Shanghai is a world-class city with a population of fifteen million, the upstream of the Huangpu River, building active bridges, downstream opening underground tunnels, traffic flowing, bustling, it is really beautiful!</p>
<p>However, we must know that planning is the ultimate goal, and the realization of the plan must be gradually advanced step by step. The expansion of the city, like water flowing to the ground, first has small streams trickling in all directions, then expanding and converging, forming a decent river or pool. The expansion of the city depends first on the extension of transportation routes and second on the expansion of security police force.</p>
<p>In the past, our government, in order to establish a decent, own Shanghai outside the concessions, spent a lot of money to build a new Shanghai. The plan at that time cannot be said to be magnificent, and the vision at that time cannot be said to be beautiful. However, the plan is, after all, a plan, and the vision is, after all, a vision. The new urban center that Shanghainese have dreamed of for a long time has still not prospered and become lively, and the most important issue is still transportation and security. (This security mainly refers to seeking the fundamental stability of society, and the enrichment of the police force is only a temporary solution.)</p>
<p>If the stinky river near Tushanwan—Lujiabang, has already been filled, if the tram on Linsen Road extends to Caohejing, or there is a public bus every ten minutes between Caohejing and Shanghai, if the railway from the City Station to Longhua, Xinzhuang, or even Songjiang has been converted into a motor vehicle road, and the trains on the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo line are changed to terminate at Songjiang, if the police substations in Longhua and Caohejing are all changed to police stations with ample police force, guaranteeing the safety of manufacturers and residents, I don't see what obstacles the development of Greater Shanghai will face in the south.</p>
<p>To the north, if the terminus of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway is changed to Nanxiang or Zhenru, and the railway extends south and west to connect with Songjiang, then the northernmost area of Shanghai Municipality has implicitly expanded to Nanxiang and Zhenru, and passengers and goods are transported to the city center via light railways or public buses, and the frequency of traffic will indirectly promote the prosperity of the market.</p>
<p>I believe that it is wasteful to use Pudong as a residential area in Shanghai. Pudong, this coastal area bordering the river, will be more suitable for factories and warehouses.</p>
<p>To the south, to the west, to the north, the development of Shanghai is unlimited, but we must pay attention to transportation and, more importantly, to security. Jiangwan could have been the headquarters of Shanghai, there are schools and factories there, but because the security in the area between Jiangwan and Shanghai is not well guaranteed, Jiangwan is still just a town.</p>

<p>Luson listened, paused for a moment, and said with a smile, "Mien, you won. You are my master, and I hope your insights are correct. But I don't know how I can pay your consultation fee."</p>
<p>"Let's talk about that problem when you have money."</p>
<p>"Then, when shall I come again?"</p>
<p>Mien hesitated for a moment and said, "Aren't you unhappy to talk about it anymore?"</p>
<p>"No, let's talk about it next time."</p>
<p>"Then, Monday, same time."</p>
<p>"Alright, I'll definitely remember to return this cane to you," Luson reached out and said, "Mien, goodbye."</p>
<p>Mien watched him limp out of the gate and stood by the window for a while in a daze. There was still a veil of mystery between the two of them, and Luson's figure gradually blurred.</p>
<p>Mien came home a little late. His wife, Bally, was waiting for him and said, "Hey, my love! I called many times to find you. Half an hour ago, the police called from Luson's house."</p>
<p>"The police?"</p>
<p>"Yes, they wouldn't explain anything. But they really want you to go there."</p>
<p>"That guy must have stolen another cigarette case," Mien said, "But I'll still go and see."</p>
<p>He hurriedly took a streetcar to Luson's house. There, a policeman was stationed. Mien said to him, "I am Mien. You asked me to come here, right?"</p>
<p>"That's right, Dr. Mien. Our police chief is currently in the hospital. You'd better go there."</p>
<p>Mien asked, "What happened? Is Mrs. Luson having trouble?"</p>
<p>The patrolman looked at him in surprise, then hesitated for a while before saying, "Yes."</p>
<p>"Is she okay?"</p>
<p>"I think it's better for you to talk to the police chief. The hospital is nearby."</p>
<p>The police chief was wearing a very neat uniform and looked a bit like a bank manager. He said, "You've come at the right time, Dr. Mien."</p>
<p>"I'm not a doctor. How is she?"</p>
<p>"Well, her condition is not good, but she is still alive. You said you're not a doctor?"</p>
<p>"Not a doctor, I am a psychoanalyst."</p>
<p>"But aren't you treating Luson? You must know his psychological situation and everything."</p>
<p>"Yes, I know everything. Does she still have hope of surviving?"</p>
<p>The police chief shrugged and said, "She took four bullets, that poor child!"</p>
<p>"Did he shoot her with a gun?"</p>
<p>The police chief looked at Mien and asked, "Yes, why do you ask?"</p>
<p>"I'm surprised that this happened."</p>
<p>"But he did do this thing, there's nothing strange about it?"</p>
<p>When Mien's eyes met the police chief's gaze, he suddenly trembled and felt that he shouldn't have said that. So he shook his head, showing a look of doubt, and didn't answer anything. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e204">The Elegant General Bai Chongxi <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>— Gan Lai</p>
<p>Bai Chongxi and his nickname "Little Zhuge Liang" have long been famous throughout the country, and there is no need to introduce him further. The general is tall and burly, with a bald head. The shiny scalp, combined with his tall body, looks just like a thick copper pillar. He was born in Guilin, Guangxi, in 1893, and is now fifty-three years old. He graduated from the third infantry class of the Baoding Military Academy in 1916. Although Bai is from a military background, he is gentle and approachable in dealing with people. He often has a smile on his face when he speaks, and when he is happy, he laughs loudly, his voice is clear, making people feel happy.</p>
<p>When he was the deputy commander-in-chief of the Fourth Group Army, he stayed in Guangxi and co-chaired the administration and construction of Guangxi Province with Mr. Li Zongren, holding civic military training, so Guangxi once had the reputation of "the whole province is soldiers." During the Anti-Japanese War, General Bai served as the Deputy Chief of Staff and Minister of Military Training. When he returned to Guangxi for inspection, Guangxi was experiencing a widespread epidemic, and soldiers were falling ill one after another. The general was familiar with medicine, so he personally drafted effective prescriptions for treating dysentery and malaria, and printed and distributed them to various troops. The prescriptions are: Treatment for Dysentery - White Peony six mace, Aurantii Fructus Immaturus two mace, Aurantii Fructus two fen, Plantago Seed six fen, Angelica six mace, Glycyrrhiza eight fen, Areca Seed six fen. Treatment for Malaria - Chinese Sweet Gum, Dichroa Febrifuga, Pangolin Scale, Areca Seed, Red Dates, Glycyrrhiza three mace each, raw Ginger three slices. It is said to be quite effective. It turns out that General Bai is not only a good general, but also a good doctor.</p>
<p>Bai understands humor quite well and knows that it is the only good medicine to adjust the serious military life. Years ago, Luo Wengan, who once served as Minister of Foreign Affairs and Minister of Justice Administration, traveled to Guangxi. General Bai had always admired Mr. Luo's knowledge and cultivation, so he held a banquet to welcome him and introduced him to the public: "Minister Luo is gentle and elegant." He has long had the nickname "Miss." Now he has come from afar, and he must have wonderful insights. I hope everyone present will hold their breath and listen quietly..."</p>
<p>General Bai's "resourcefulness" is, of course, due to his extraordinary intelligence, but it is said that half of it is due to his past staff, these four little brains are: Zhang Dingfan, Wang Gongdu, Liu Weizhang, Pan Yizhi. Zhang once served as the mayor of Shanghai and was most relied upon by Bai. General Bai used to dislike approaching news reporters, but recently he has learned how to deal with the clever words of reporters.</p>
<p>Weekly Chat - Discussion on Wedding Ceremonies</p>
<h3 id="e205">A Cliche <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>— Hong Yin</p>
<p>The transformation of wedding ceremonies in recent years has two reasons:</p>
<p>The collapse of the old etiquette and the death of vulgar customs have made it necessary for weddings to have a new form, this is one;</p>
<p>The poor national economic situation and social instability have made it impossible for wedding ceremonies to be simple, this is two.</p>
<p>Due to these two main factors, wedding ceremonies have become varied in recent years, each with its own set of rules. From a good perspective, the social atmosphere has gradually tended to strive for practicality and not make excessive extravagance on "face"; from a bad perspective, general weddings are sloppy and chaotic, forming a disregard for the ceremony, so it is easy to get married and easy to divorce, which cannot benefit social stability.</p>
<p>Judging from the current situation, it is difficult to have a fixed form for wedding ceremonies other than religious ceremonies, and the detailed form can only be determined by each person's economic strength and preferences. However, if we talk about the matter on its merits and strive to be close to reason, then the decision of the wedding ceremony cannot overturn the two major principles that most people consider to be correct: simple and solemn. This may be an old tune, but it is the most enlightened proposition.</p>
<p>I believe that starting a family is like starting a business. There is no need to be unconventional, no need to deliberately make a splash, and no need to force extravagance to be happy for a while! The legal ceremony cannot be omitted. The atmosphere in the wedding (including music, clothing, organization...) must be expressed in an orderly, solemn, enthusiastic, and simple manner. On the other hand, such as the wording of the certificate, the advertisement in the newspaper, the content of the wedding invitation, etc., there is no harm in using vernacular, using more meaningful words, and not inheriting the old clichés of thousands of years! This shows that the new couple has a spirit of reform towards the old customs and bad habits of society. In addition, new couples should resolutely cancel all superstitious actions without taking a compromising attitude.</p>
<p>For a newly married couple, we hope that they have a deep impression of the ceremony, understand the social significance of marriage, and on the other hand, in the pursuit of simple ceremonies, we hope that they understand: the meaning of this "simplicity" is to be realistic in everything, not to make gimmicks for empty showmanship, and not to consume a lot of social resources for personal marriage! Marriage is the starting point of entrepreneurship, and the handling of the wedding shows their attitude towards the career from now on!</p>
<h3 id="e206">Group Wedding <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>— Stubborn Stone</p>
<p>The wedding ceremony I idealize is to advocate the current "group wedding" ceremony. Below are my reasons:</p>
<p>(1) The group wedding ceremony is neither too simple nor too troublesome. (2) I think it is not necessary to pay much attention to the ceremony of marriage. The group life is certainly not as grand as the "old method" or "new method" of marriage in the ceremony, but it is more practical. (3) The group wedding ceremony can save money and reduce time. (4) Group weddings are popular, regardless of treasure and poverty, everyone can enjoy this wedding ceremony.</p>
<h3 id="e207">Being Realistic <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>— Li Fengchi</p>
<p>Although the wedding ceremony had few changes in the past, it is unknown how many colorful changes have been made from the end of the Qing Dynasty to the present. In a nutshell, it is from complexity to simplicity. I remember when I was a child, I went to relatives' houses to eat wedding banquets with my parents, and it always took five or six days. At that time, the habit was that even middle-class families had to busy themselves for four or five days to hold a wedding. Rich merchants and wealthy officials often spent half a month or twenty days on a wedding. Relatives from afar had already come to congratulate them many days in advance.</p>
<p>Such extravagance cannot be said to be without the intention of stabilizing the relationship between men and women, but in today's poor and turbulent world, the rich are free to hold extravagant weddings, and the poor do not have to pretend to be "tycoons," resulting in being heavily in debt after marriage, and being sorry for the little babies of the next generation, and sorry for themselves!</p>
<h3 id="e208">Holding a Dance <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>I advocate that, in addition to the statutory ceremonies that cannot be avoided, the remaining detailed methods should be left to the free decision of the newly married couple. Those who like dance music may hold a dance party and hold a music performance at the same time as the ceremony, so that everyone can enjoy themselves and leave. Dance parties and music are properly implemented and do not waste financial resources!</p>
<h3 id="e209">To Tell the Truth <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>— Sha</p>
<p>Young people are most likely to have extreme attitudes towards wedding ceremonies. I think marriage itself is the most ordinary and simple thing, and there is no need to strive to be different in the ceremony. If you want to show transcendence, you might as well not get married! Not getting married, true celibacy, is indeed not "庸凡"!</p>
